by

wharton
part
i
it
is
not
often
that
youth
allows
itself
to
feel
undividedly
happy
the
sensation
is
too
much
the
result
of
selection
and
elimination
to
be
within
reach
of
the
awakening
clutch
on
life
but
kate
orme
for
once
had
yielded
herself
to
happiness
letting
it
permeate
every
faculty
as
a
spring
rain
soaks
into
a
germinating
meadow
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
this
sudden
sense
of
beatitude
but
was
it
not
this
precisely
which
made
it
so
irresistible
so
overwhelming
there
had
been
within
the
last
two
months
since
her
engagement
to
denis
peyton
no
distinct
addition
to
the
sum
of
her
happiness
and
no
possibility
she
would
have
affirmed
of
adding
perceptibly
to
a
total
already
incalculable
inwardly
and
outwardly
the
conditions
of
her
life
were
unchanged
but
whereas
before
the
air
had
been
full
of
flitting
wings
now
they
seemed
to
pause
over
her
and
she
could
trust
herself
to
their
shelter
many
influences
had
combined
to
build
up
the
centre
of
brooding
peace
in
which
she
found
herself
her
nature
answered
to
the
finest
vibrations
and
at
first
her
joy
in
loving
had
been
too
great
not
to
bring
with
it
a
certain
confusion
a
readjusting
of
the
whole
scenery
of
life
she
found
herself
in
a
new
country
wherein
he
who
had
led
her
there
was
least
able
to
be
her
guide
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
that
the
first
stranger
in
the
street
could
have
interpreted
her
happiness
for
her
more
easily
than
denis
then
as
her
eye
adapted
itself
as
the
lines
flowed
into
each
other
opening
deep
vistas
upon
new
horizons
she
began
to
enter
into
possession
of
her
kingdom
to
entertain
the
actual
sense
of
its
belonging
to
her
but
she
had
never
before
felt
that
she
also
belonged
to
it
and
this
was
the
feeling
which
now
came
to
complete
her
happiness
to
give
it
the
hallowing
sense
of
permanence
she
rose
from
the
where
list
in
hand
she
had
been
going
over
the
and
walked
toward
the
window
everything
about
her
seemed
to
contribute
to
that
rare
harmony
of
feeling
which
levied
a
tax
on
every
sense
the
large
coolness
of
the
room
its
fine
traditional
air
of
spacious
living
its
outlook
over
field
and
woodland
toward
the
lake
lying
under
the
silver
bloom
of
september
the
very
scent
of
the
late
violets
in
a
glass
on
the
the
masses
of
hydrangea
in
tubs
along
the
terrace
the
fall
now
and
then
of
a
leaf
through
the
still
air
all
somehow
were
mingled
in
the
suffusion
of
that
yet
made
them
seem
but
so
much
dross
upon
its
current
the
girl
s
smile
prolonged
itself
at
the
sight
of
a
figure
approaching
from
the
lower
slopes
above
the
lake
the
path
was
a
short
cut
from
the
peyton
place
and
she
had
known
that
denis
would
appear
in
it
at
about
that
hour
her
smile
however
was
prolonged
not
so
much
by
his
approach
as
by
her
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
communicating
her
mood
to
him
the
feeling
did
not
disturb
her
she
could
not
imagine
sharing
her
deepest
moods
with
any
one
and
the
world
in
which
she
lived
with
denis
was
too
bright
and
spacious
to
admit
of
any
sense
of
constraint
her
smile
was
in
truth
a
tribute
to
that
directness
of
his
which
was
so
often
a
refuge
from
her
own
complexities
denis
peyton
was
used
to
being
met
with
a
smile
he
might
have
been
pardoned
for
thinking
smiles
the
habitual
wear
of
the
human
countenance
and
his
estimate
of
life
and
of
himself
was
necessarily
tinged
by
the
cordial
terms
on
which
they
had
always
met
each
other
he
had
in
fact
found
life
from
the
start
an
uncommonly
agreeable
business
culminating
fitly
enough
in
his
engagement
to
the
only
girl
he
had
ever
wished
to
marry
and
the
inheritance
from
his
unhappy
of
a
fortune
which
agreeably
widened
his
horizon
such
a
combination
of
circumstances
might
well
justify
a
young
man
in
thinking
himself
of
some
account
in
the
universe
and
it
seemed
the
final
touch
of
fitness
that
the
mourning
which
denis
still
wore
for
poor
arthur
should
lend
a
new
distinction
to
his
somewhat
florid
good
looks
kate
orme
was
not
without
an
amused
perception
of
her
future
husband
s
point
of
view
but
she
could
enter
into
it
with
the
tolerance
which
allows
for
the
inconscient
element
in
all
our
judgments
there
was
for
instance
no
one
more
sentimentally
humane
than
denis
s
mother
the
second
peyton
a
scented
silvery
person
whose
lavender
silks
and
manner
expressed
a
mind
with
its
blinds
drawn
down
toward
all
the
unpleasantness
of
life
yet
it
was
clear
that
peyton
saw
a
dispensation
in
the
fact
that
her
had
never
married
and
that
his
death
had
enabled
denis
at
the
right
moment
to
step
gracefully
into
affluence
was
it
not
after
all
a
sign
of
to
take
the
gifts
of
the
gods
in
this
religious
spirit
discovering
fresh
evidence
of
design
in
what
had
once
seemed
the
sad
fact
of
arthur
s
inaccessibility
to
correction
peyton
beautifully
conscious
of
having
done
her
best
for
arthur
would
have
thought
it
unchristian
to
repine
at
the
providential
failure
of
her
efforts
denis
s
deductions
were
of
course
a
little
less
direct
than
his
mother
s
he
had
besides
been
fond
of
arthur
and
his
efforts
to
keep
the
poor
fellow
straight
had
been
less
didactic
and
more
spontaneous
their
result
read
itself
if
not
in
any
change
in
arthur
s
character
at
least
in
the
revised
wording
of
his
will
and
denis
s
moral
sense
was
pleasantly
fortified
by
the
discovery
that
it
very
substantially
paid
to
be
a
good
fellow
the
sense
of
general
providentialness
on
which
peyton
reposed
had
in
fact
been
confirmed
by
events
which
reduced
denis
s
mourning
to
a
mere
tribute
of
respect
since
it
would
have
been
a
mockery
to
deplore
the
disappearance
of
any
one
who
had
left
behind
him
such
an
unsavory
wake
as
poor
arthur
kate
did
not
quite
know
what
had
happened
her
father
was
as
firmly
convinced
as
peyton
that
young
girls
should
not
be
admitted
to
any
open
discussion
of
life
she
could
only
gather
from
the
silences
and
evasions
amid
which
she
moved
that
a
woman
had
turned
up
a
woman
who
was
of
course
dreadful
and
whose
dreadfulness
appeared
to
include
a
sort
of
shadowy
claim
upon
arthur
but
the
claim
whatever
it
was
had
been
promptly
discredited
the
whole
question
had
vanished
and
the
woman
with
it
the
blinds
were
drawn
again
on
the
ugly
side
of
things
and
life
was
resumed
on
the
usual
assumption
that
no
such
side
existed
kate
knew
only
that
a
darkness
had
crossed
her
sky
and
left
it
as
unclouded
as
before
was
it
perhaps
she
now
asked
herself
the
very
lifting
of
the
cloud
remote
unthreatening
as
it
had
been
which
gave
such
new
serenity
to
her
heaven
it
was
horrible
to
think
that
one
s
deepest
security
was
a
mere
sense
of
escape
that
happiness
was
no
more
than
a
reprieve
the
perversity
of
such
ideas
was
emphasized
by
peyton
s
approach
he
had
the
gift
of
restoring
things
to
their
normal
relations
of
carrying
one
over
the
chasms
of
life
through
the
closed
tunnel
of
an
incurious
cheerfulness
all
that
was
restless
and
questioning
in
the
girl
subsided
in
his
presence
and
she
was
content
to
take
her
love
as
a
gift
of
grace
which
began
just
where
the
office
of
reason
ended
she
was
more
than
ever
in
this
mood
of
charmed
surrender
more
than
ever
he
seemed
the
keynote
of
the
accord
between
herself
and
life
the
centre
of
a
delightful
complicity
in
every
surrounding
circumstance
one
could
not
look
at
him
without
seeing
that
there
was
always
a
fair
wind
in
his
sails
it
was
carrying
him
toward
her
as
usual
at
a
quick
confident
pace
which
nevertheless
lagged
a
little
she
noticed
as
he
emerged
from
the
and
struck
across
the
lawn
he
walked
as
though
he
were
tired
she
had
meant
to
wait
for
him
on
the
terrace
held
in
check
by
her
usual
inclination
to
linger
on
the
threshold
of
her
pleasures
but
now
something
drew
her
toward
him
and
she
went
quickly
down
the
steps
and
across
the
lawn
denis
you
look
tired
i
was
afraid
something
had
she
had
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
as
they
moved
forward
she
glanced
up
at
him
struck
not
so
much
by
any
new
look
in
his
face
as
by
the
fact
that
her
approach
had
made
no
change
in
it
i
am
rather
is
your
father
in
papa
she
looked
up
in
surprise
he
went
to
town
yesterday
don
t
you
remember
of
course
i
d
forgotten
you
re
alone
then
she
dropped
his
arm
and
stood
before
him
he
was
very
pale
now
with
the
furrowed
look
of
extreme
physical
weariness
denis
are
you
ill
anything
happened
he
forced
a
smile
yes
but
you
needn
t
look
so
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
reassurance
was
safe
after
all
and
all
else
for
a
moment
seemed
to
swing
below
the
rim
of
her
world
your
mother
she
then
said
with
a
fresh
start
of
fear
it
s
not
my
they
had
reached
the
terrace
and
he
moved
toward
the
house
let
us
go
indoors
there
s
such
a
beastly
glare
out
he
seemed
to
find
relief
in
the
cool
obscurity
of
the
where
after
the
brightness
of
the
afternoon
light
their
faces
were
almost
indistinguishable
to
each
other
she
sat
down
and
he
moved
a
few
paces
away
before
the
he
paused
to
look
at
the
neatly
sorted
heaps
of
they
are
to
be
sent
out
he
turned
back
and
stood
before
her
it
s
about
the
woman
he
began
abruptly
the
woman
who
pretended
to
be
arthur
s
kate
started
as
at
the
clutch
of
an
unacknowledged
fear
she
his
wife
then
peyton
made
an
impatient
movement
of
negation
if
she
was
why
didn
t
she
prove
it
she
hadn
t
a
shred
of
evidence
the
courts
rejected
her
well
then
well
she
s
he
paused
and
the
next
words
came
with
difficulty
she
and
the
the
child
there
was
a
child
kate
started
up
and
then
sank
down
these
were
not
things
about
which
young
girls
were
told
the
confused
sense
of
horror
had
been
nothing
to
this
first
sharp
edge
of
fact
and
both
are
dead
how
do
you
know
my
father
said
she
had
gone
away
gone
back
to
the
west
so
we
thought
but
this
morning
we
found
found
her
he
motioned
toward
the
window
out
there
in
the
both
she
drooped
before
him
shudderingly
her
eyes
hidden
as
though
to
exclude
the
vision
she
had
drowned
herself
oh
poor
thing
poor
thing
they
paused
awhile
the
minutes
delving
an
abyss
between
them
till
he
threw
a
few
irrelevant
words
across
the
silence
one
of
the
gardeners
found
poor
thing
it
was
sufficiently
horrible
oh
she
had
swung
round
again
to
her
pole
poor
denis
were
not
there
didn
t
have
to
i
had
to
see
she
felt
the
instant
relief
in
his
voice
he
could
talk
now
could
distend
his
nerves
in
the
warm
air
of
her
sympathy
i
had
to
identify
he
rose
nervously
and
began
to
pace
the
room
it
s
knocked
the
wind
out
of
me
i
my
god
i
couldn
t
foresee
it
could
i
he
halted
before
her
with
outstretched
hands
of
argument
i
did
all
i
could
it
s
not
fault
is
it
your
fault
denis
she
wouldn
t
take
the
money
he
broke
off
checked
by
her
awakened
glance
the
money
what
money
her
face
changed
hardening
as
his
relaxed
had
you
offered
her
to
give
up
the
case
he
stared
a
moment
and
then
dismissed
the
implication
with
a
laugh
no
no
after
the
case
was
decided
against
her
she
seemed
hard
up
and
i
sent
hinton
to
her
with
a
and
she
refused
it
what
did
she
say
oh
i
don
t
know
the
usual
thing
that
she
d
only
wanted
to
prove
she
was
his
wife
on
the
child
s
account
that
she
d
never
wanted
his
money
hinton
said
she
was
very
quiet
not
in
the
least
excited
but
she
sent
back
the
kate
sat
motionless
her
head
bent
her
hands
clasped
about
her
knees
she
no
longer
looked
at
peyton
could
there
have
been
a
mistake
she
asked
slowly
a
mistake
she
raised
her
head
now
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
with
a
strange
insistence
of
observation
could
they
have
been
married
the
courts
didn
t
think
could
the
courts
have
been
mistaken
he
started
up
again
and
threw
himself
into
another
chair
good
god
kate
we
gave
her
every
chance
to
prove
her
case
why
didn
t
she
do
it
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
such
things
are
kept
from
girls
why
whenever
a
man
of
arthur
s
kind
dies
such
such
women
turn
up
there
are
lawyers
who
live
on
such
jobs
ask
your
father
about
it
of
course
this
woman
expected
to
be
bought
off
but
if
she
wouldn
t
take
your
money
she
expected
a
big
sum
i
mean
to
drop
the
case
when
she
found
we
meant
to
fight
it
she
saw
the
game
was
up
i
suppose
it
was
her
last
throw
and
she
was
desperate
we
don
t
know
how
many
times
she
may
have
been
through
the
same
thing
before
that
kind
of
woman
is
always
trying
to
make
money
out
of
the
heirs
of
any
man
who
who
has
been
about
with
kate
received
this
in
silence
she
had
a
sense
of
walking
along
a
narrow
ledge
of
consciousness
above
a
sheer
hallucinating
depth
into
which
she
dared
not
look
but
the
depth
drew
her
and
she
plunged
one
terrified
glance
into
it
but
the
child
the
child
was
arthur
s
peyton
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
again
how
can
we
tell
why
i
don
t
suppose
the
woman
herself
i
wish
to
heaven
your
father
were
here
to
explain
she
rose
and
crossed
over
to
him
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
almost
maternal
don
t
let
us
talk
of
it
she
said
you
did
all
you
could
think
what
a
comfort
you
were
to
poor
he
let
her
hands
lie
where
she
had
placed
them
without
response
or
resistance
i
tried
i
tried
hard
to
keep
him
straight
we
all
know
that
every
one
knows
it
and
we
know
how
grateful
he
was
what
a
difference
it
made
to
him
in
the
end
it
would
have
been
dreadful
to
think
of
his
dying
out
there
she
drew
him
down
on
a
sofa
and
seated
herself
by
his
side
a
deep
lassitude
was
upon
him
and
the
hand
she
had
possessed
herself
of
lay
in
her
hold
inert
it
was
splendid
of
you
to
travel
day
and
night
as
you
did
and
then
that
dreadful
week
before
he
died
but
for
you
he
would
have
died
alone
among
he
sat
silent
his
head
dropping
forward
his
eyes
fixed
among
strangers
he
repeated
absently
she
looked
up
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
that
poor
woman
did
you
ever
see
her
while
you
were
out
there
he
drew
his
hand
away
and
gathered
his
brows
together
as
if
in
an
effort
of
remembrance
i
saw
her
oh
yes
i
saw
he
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
from
his
forehead
and
stood
up
let
us
go
out
he
said
my
head
is
in
a
fog
i
want
to
get
away
from
it
a
wave
of
compunction
drew
her
to
her
feet
it
was
my
fault
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
so
many
she
turned
and
rang
the
bell
i
ll
order
the
ponies
we
shall
have
time
for
a
drive
before
ii
with
the
sunset
in
their
faces
they
swept
through
the
autumn
air
at
the
swiftest
pace
of
kate
s
ponies
she
had
given
the
reins
to
peyton
and
he
had
turned
the
horses
heads
away
from
the
lake
rising
by
woody
upland
lanes
to
the
high
pastures
which
still
held
the
sunlight
the
horses
were
fresh
enough
to
claim
his
undivided
attention
and
he
drove
in
silence
his
smooth
fair
profile
turned
to
his
companion
who
sat
silent
also
kate
orme
was
engaged
in
one
of
those
rapid
mental
excursions
which
were
forever
sweeping
her
from
the
straight
path
of
the
actual
into
uncharted
regions
of
conjecture
her
survey
of
life
had
always
been
marked
by
the
tendency
to
seek
out
ultimate
relations
to
extend
her
researches
to
the
limit
of
her
imaginative
experience
but
hitherto
she
had
been
like
some
young
captive
brought
up
in
a
windowless
palace
whose
painted
walls
she
takes
for
the
actual
world
now
the
palace
had
been
shaken
to
its
base
and
through
a
cleft
in
the
walls
she
looked
out
upon
life
for
the
first
moment
all
was
indistinguishable
blackness
then
she
began
to
detect
vague
shapes
and
confused
gestures
in
the
depths
there
were
people
below
there
men
like
denis
girls
like
herself
for
under
the
unlikeness
she
felt
the
strange
affinity
all
struggling
in
that
awful
coil
of
moral
darkness
with
agonized
hands
reaching
up
for
rescue
her
heart
shrank
from
the
horror
of
it
and
then
in
a
passion
of
pity
drew
back
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
suddenly
her
eyes
turned
toward
denis
his
face
was
grave
but
less
disturbed
and
men
knew
about
these
things
they
carried
this
abyss
in
their
bosoms
and
went
about
smiling
and
sat
at
the
feet
of
innocence
could
it
be
that
denis
denis
even
ah
no
she
remembered
what
he
had
been
to
poor
arthur
she
understood
now
the
vague
allusions
to
what
he
had
tried
to
do
for
his
brother
he
had
seen
arthur
down
there
in
that
coiling
blackness
and
had
leaned
over
and
tried
to
drag
him
out
but
arthur
was
too
deep
down
and
his
arms
were
interlocked
with
other
arms
they
had
dragged
each
other
deeper
poor
souls
like
drowning
people
who
fight
together
in
the
waves
kate
s
visualizing
habit
gave
a
hateful
precision
and
persistency
to
the
image
she
had
evoked
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
vision
of
anguished
shapes
striving
together
in
the
darkness
the
horror
of
it
took
her
by
the
throat
she
drew
a
choking
breath
and
felt
the
tears
on
her
face
peyton
turned
to
her
the
horses
were
climbing
a
hill
and
his
attention
had
strayed
from
them
this
has
done
me
good
he
began
but
as
he
looked
his
voice
changed
kate
what
is
it
why
are
you
crying
oh
for
god
s
sake
he
ended
his
hand
closing
on
her
wrist
she
steadied
herself
and
raised
her
eyes
to
his
i
i
couldn
t
help
it
she
stammered
struggling
in
the
sudden
release
of
her
pent
compassion
it
seems
so
awful
that
we
should
stand
so
close
to
this
horror
that
it
might
have
been
you
who
i
who
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
he
broke
in
stridently
oh
don
t
you
see
i
found
myself
exulting
that
you
and
i
were
so
far
from
it
above
it
safe
in
ourselves
and
each
other
and
then
the
other
feeling
came
the
sense
of
selfishness
of
going
by
on
the
other
side
and
i
tried
to
realize
that
it
might
have
been
you
and
i
who
who
were
down
there
in
the
night
and
the
flood
peyton
let
the
whip
fall
on
the
ponies
flanks
upon
my
soul
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
must
have
a
nice
opinion
of
both
of
the
words
fell
chillingly
on
the
blaze
of
her
would
she
never
learn
to
remember
that
denis
was
incapable
of
mounting
such
hypothetical
pyres
he
might
be
as
alive
as
herself
to
the
direct
demands
of
duty
but
of
its
imaginative
claims
he
was
robustly
unconscious
the
thought
brought
a
wholesome
reaction
of
thankfulness
ah
well
she
said
the
sunset
dilating
through
her
tears
don
t
you
see
that
i
can
bear
to
think
such
things
only
because
they
re
impossibilities
it
s
easy
to
look
over
into
the
depths
if
one
has
a
rampart
to
lean
on
what
i
most
pity
poor
arthur
for
is
that
instead
of
that
woman
lying
there
so
dreadfully
dead
there
might
have
been
a
girl
like
me
so
exquisitely
alive
because
of
him
but
it
seems
cruel
doesn
t
it
to
let
what
he
was
not
add
ever
so
little
to
the
value
of
what
you
are
to
let
him
contribute
ever
so
little
to
my
happiness
by
the
difference
there
is
between
you
she
was
conscious
as
she
spoke
of
straying
again
beyond
his
reach
through
intricacies
of
sensation
new
even
to
her
exploring
susceptibilities
a
happy
literalness
usually
enabled
him
to
strike
a
short
cut
through
such
labyrinths
and
rejoin
her
smiling
on
the
other
side
but
now
she
became
wonderingly
aware
that
he
had
been
caught
in
the
thick
of
her
hypothesis
it
s
the
difference
that
makes
you
care
for
me
then
he
broke
out
with
a
kind
of
violence
which
seemed
to
renew
his
clutch
on
her
wrist
the
difference
he
lashed
the
ponies
again
so
sharply
that
a
murmur
escaped
her
and
he
drew
them
up
quivering
with
an
inconsequent
steady
boys
at
which
their
ears
protested
it
s
because
i
m
moral
and
respectable
and
all
that
that
you
re
fond
of
me
he
went
on
you
re
you
re
simply
in
love
with
my
virtues
you
couldn
t
imagine
caring
if
i
were
down
there
in
the
ditch
as
you
say
with
arthur
the
question
fell
on
a
silence
which
seemed
to
deepen
suddenly
within
herself
every
thought
hung
bated
on
the
sense
that
something
was
coming
her
whole
consciousness
became
a
void
to
receive
it
denis
she
cried
he
turned
on
her
almost
savagely
i
don
t
want
your
pity
you
know
he
burst
out
you
can
keep
that
for
arthur
i
had
an
idea
women
loved
men
for
themselves
through
everything
i
mean
but
i
wouldn
t
steal
your
love
i
don
t
want
it
on
false
pretenses
you
understand
go
and
look
into
other
men
s
lives
that
s
all
i
ask
of
you
i
slipped
into
it
it
was
just
a
case
of
holding
my
tongue
when
i
ought
to
have
spoken
but
i
i
for
god
s
sake
don
t
sit
there
staring
i
suppose
you
ve
seen
all
along
that
i
knew
he
was
married
to
the
iii
the
housekeeper
s
reminding
her
that
orme
would
be
at
home
the
next
day
for
dinner
and
did
she
think
he
would
like
the
venison
with
claret
sauce
or
jelly
roused
kate
to
the
first
consciousness
of
her
surroundings
her
father
would
return
on
the
morrow
he
would
give
to
the
dressing
of
the
venison
such
minute
consideration
as
in
his
opinion
every
detail
affecting
his
comfort
or
convenience
quite
obviously
merited
and
if
it
were
not
the
venison
it
would
be
something
else
if
it
were
not
the
housekeeper
it
would
be
orme
charged
with
the
results
of
a
conference
with
his
agent
a
at
his
club
or
any
of
the
other
incidents
which
by
happening
to
himself
became
events
kate
found
herself
caught
in
the
inexorable
continuity
of
life
found
herself
gazing
over
a
scene
of
ruin
lit
up
by
the
punctual
recurrence
of
habit
as
nature
s
calm
stare
lights
the
morrow
of
a
whirlwind
life
was
going
on
then
and
dragging
her
at
its
wheels
she
could
neither
check
its
rush
nor
wrench
loose
from
it
and
drop
out
oh
how
blessedly
into
darkness
and
cessation
she
must
go
bounding
on
racked
broken
but
alive
in
every
fibre
the
most
she
could
hope
was
a
few
hours
respite
not
from
her
own
terrors
but
from
the
pressure
of
outward
claims
the
midday
halt
during
which
the
victim
is
unbound
while
his
torturers
rest
from
their
efforts
till
her
father
s
return
she
would
have
the
house
to
herself
and
the
question
of
the
venison
despatched
could
give
herself
to
long
lonely
pacings
of
the
empty
rooms
and
shuddering
subsidences
upon
her
pillow
her
first
impulse
as
the
mist
cleared
from
her
brain
was
the
habitual
one
of
reaching
out
for
ultimate
relations
she
wanted
to
know
the
worst
and
for
her
as
she
saw
in
a
flash
the
worst
of
it
was
the
core
of
fatality
in
what
had
happened
she
shrank
from
her
own
way
of
putting
it
nor
was
it
even
figuratively
true
that
she
had
ever
felt
under
faith
in
denis
any
such
doubt
as
the
perception
implied
but
that
was
merely
because
her
imagination
had
never
put
him
to
the
test
she
was
fond
of
exposing
herself
to
hypothetical
ordeals
but
somehow
she
had
never
carried
denis
with
her
on
these
adventures
what
she
saw
now
was
that
in
a
world
of
strangeness
he
remained
the
object
least
strange
to
her
she
was
not
in
the
tragic
case
of
the
girl
who
suddenly
sees
her
lover
unmasked
no
mask
had
dropped
from
denis
s
face
the
pink
shades
had
simply
been
lifted
from
the
lamps
and
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
in
an
unmitigated
glare
such
exposure
does
not
alter
the
features
but
it
lays
an
ugly
emphasis
on
the
most
charming
lines
pushing
the
smile
to
a
grin
the
curve
of
to
the
droop
of
slackness
and
it
was
precisely
into
the
flagging
lines
of
extreme
weakness
that
denis
s
graceful
contour
flowed
in
the
terrible
talk
which
had
followed
his
avowal
and
wherein
every
word
flashed
a
light
on
his
moral
processes
she
had
been
less
startled
by
what
he
had
done
than
by
the
way
in
which
his
conscience
had
already
become
a
passive
surface
for
the
channelling
of
consequences
he
was
like
a
child
who
had
put
a
match
to
the
curtains
and
stands
agape
at
the
blaze
it
was
horribly
naughty
to
put
the
match
but
beyond
that
the
child
s
responsibility
did
not
extend
in
this
business
of
arthur
s
where
all
had
been
wrong
from
the
beginning
where
might
well
find
a
plea
for
its
casuistries
in
the
absence
of
a
definite
right
to
be
measured
by
it
had
been
easy
after
the
first
slip
to
drop
a
little
lower
with
each
struggle
the
woman
oh
the
woman
was
well
of
the
kind
who
prey
on
such
men
arthur
out
there
at
his
lowest
ebb
had
drifted
into
living
with
her
as
a
man
drifts
into
drink
or
opium
he
knew
what
she
was
he
knew
where
she
had
come
from
but
he
had
fallen
ill
and
she
had
nursed
him
nursed
him
devotedly
of
course
that
was
her
chance
and
she
knew
it
before
he
was
out
of
the
fever
she
had
the
noose
around
him
he
came
to
and
found
himself
married
such
cases
were
common
enough
if
the
man
recovered
he
bought
off
the
woman
and
got
a
divorce
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
business
the
marriage
the
bribe
the
divorce
some
of
those
women
made
a
big
income
out
of
it
they
were
married
and
divorced
once
a
year
if
arthur
had
only
got
well
but
instead
he
had
a
relapse
and
died
and
there
was
the
woman
made
his
widow
by
mischance
as
it
were
with
her
child
on
her
arm
whose
child
and
a
scoundrelly
lawyer
to
work
up
her
case
for
her
her
claim
was
clear
enough
the
right
of
dower
a
third
of
his
estate
but
if
he
had
never
meant
to
marry
her
if
he
had
been
trapped
as
patently
as
a
rustic
fleeced
in
a
arthur
in
his
last
hours
had
confessed
to
the
marriage
but
had
also
acknowledged
its
folly
and
after
his
death
when
denis
came
to
look
about
him
and
make
inquiries
he
found
that
the
witnesses
if
there
had
been
any
were
dispersed
and
undiscoverable
the
whole
question
hinged
on
arthur
s
statement
to
his
brother
suppress
that
statement
and
the
claim
vanished
and
with
it
the
scandal
the
humiliation
the
burden
of
the
woman
and
child
dragging
the
name
of
peyton
through
heaven
knew
what
depths
he
had
thought
of
that
first
denis
swore
rather
than
of
the
money
the
money
of
course
had
made
a
difference
he
was
too
honest
not
to
own
it
but
not
till
afterward
he
declared
would
have
declared
on
his
honour
but
that
the
word
tripped
him
up
and
sent
a
flush
to
his
forehead
thus
in
broken
phrases
he
flung
his
defence
at
her
a
defence
improvised
pieced
together
as
he
went
along
to
mask
the
crude
instinctiveness
of
his
act
for
with
increasing
clearness
kate
saw
as
she
listened
that
there
had
been
no
real
struggle
in
his
mind
that
but
for
the
grim
logic
of
chance
he
might
never
have
felt
the
need
of
any
justification
if
the
woman
after
the
manner
of
such
baffled
huntresses
had
wandered
off
in
search
of
fresh
prey
he
might
quite
sincerely
have
congratulated
himself
on
having
saved
a
decent
name
and
an
honest
fortune
from
her
talons
it
was
the
price
she
had
paid
to
establish
her
claim
that
for
the
first
time
brought
him
to
a
startled
sense
of
its
justice
his
conscience
responded
only
to
the
concrete
pressure
of
facts
it
was
with
the
anguish
of
this
discovery
that
kate
orme
locked
herself
in
at
the
end
of
their
talk
how
the
talk
had
ended
how
at
length
she
had
got
him
from
the
room
and
the
house
she
recalled
but
confusedly
the
tragedy
of
the
woman
s
death
and
of
his
own
share
in
it
were
as
nothing
in
the
disaster
of
his
bright
irreclaimableness
once
when
she
had
cried
out
you
would
have
married
me
and
said
nothing
and
he
groaned
back
but
i
told
you
she
felt
like
a
trainer
with
a
lash
above
some
bewildered
animal
but
she
persisted
savagely
you
told
me
because
you
had
to
because
your
nerves
gave
way
because
you
knew
it
couldn
t
hurt
you
to
the
perplexed
appeal
of
his
gaze
had
almost
checked
her
you
told
me
because
it
was
a
relief
but
nothing
will
really
relieve
you
nothing
will
really
help
you
till
you
have
told
some
one
who
who
hurt
who
will
hurt
me
till
you
have
told
the
truth
as
as
openly
as
you
he
started
up
ghastly
with
fear
i
don
t
understand
you
must
confess
then
publicly
openly
you
must
go
to
the
judge
i
don
t
know
how
it
s
to
the
judge
when
they
re
both
dead
when
everything
is
at
an
end
what
good
could
that
do
he
groaned
everything
is
not
at
an
end
for
you
everything
is
just
beginning
you
must
clear
yourself
of
this
guilt
and
there
is
only
one
way
to
confess
it
and
you
must
give
back
the
this
seemed
to
strike
him
as
conclusive
proof
of
her
irrelevance
i
wish
i
had
never
heard
of
the
money
but
to
whom
would
you
have
me
give
it
back
i
tell
you
she
was
a
waif
out
of
the
gutter
i
don
t
believe
any
one
knew
her
real
name
i
don
t
believe
she
had
she
must
have
had
a
mother
and
am
i
to
devote
my
life
to
hunting
for
them
through
the
slums
of
california
and
how
shall
i
know
when
i
have
found
them
it
s
impossible
to
make
you
understand
i
did
wrong
i
did
horribly
wrong
but
that
is
not
the
way
to
repair
what
is
then
he
paused
a
little
askance
at
the
question
to
do
better
to
do
my
best
he
said
with
a
sudden
flourish
of
firmness
to
take
warning
by
this
dreadful
oh
be
silent
she
cried
out
and
hid
her
face
he
looked
at
her
hopelessly
at
last
he
said
i
don
t
know
what
good
it
can
do
to
go
on
talking
i
have
only
one
more
thing
to
say
of
course
you
know
that
you
are
he
spoke
simply
with
a
sudden
return
to
his
old
voice
and
accent
at
which
she
weakened
as
under
a
caress
she
lifted
her
head
and
gazed
at
him
am
i
she
said
musingly
kate
burst
from
him
but
she
raised
a
silencing
hand
it
seems
to
me
she
said
that
i
am
imprisoned
imprisoned
with
you
in
this
dreadful
thing
first
i
must
help
you
to
get
out
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
his
face
fell
and
he
stammered
i
don
t
understand
i
can
t
say
what
i
shall
do
or
how
i
shall
feel
till
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
and
you
must
see
how
i
feel
that
i
m
half
dead
with
yes
but
that
is
only
he
turned
this
over
for
a
perceptible
space
of
time
before
asking
slowly
you
mean
that
you
ll
give
me
up
if
i
don
t
do
this
crazy
thing
you
propose
she
paused
in
turn
no
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
bribe
you
you
must
feel
the
need
of
it
the
need
of
proclaiming
this
thing
publicly
he
sat
staring
before
him
of
course
you
realize
what
it
would
mean
he
began
at
length
to
you
she
returned
i
put
that
aside
to
others
to
you
i
should
go
to
i
suppose
so
she
said
simply
you
seem
to
take
it
very
easily
i
m
afraid
my
mother
wouldn
your
mother
this
produced
the
effect
he
had
expected
you
hadn
t
thought
of
her
i
suppose
it
would
probably
kill
it
would
have
killed
her
to
think
that
you
could
do
what
you
have
done
it
would
have
made
her
very
unhappy
but
there
s
a
yes
there
was
a
difference
a
difference
which
no
rhetoric
could
disguise
the
secret
sin
would
have
made
peyton
wretched
but
it
would
not
have
killed
her
and
she
would
have
taken
precisely
denis
s
view
of
the
elasticity
of
atonement
she
would
have
accepted
private
regrets
as
the
genteel
equivalent
of
open
expiation
kate
could
even
imagine
her
extracting
a
lesson
from
the
providential
fact
that
her
son
had
not
been
found
out
you
see
it
s
not
so
simple
he
broke
out
with
a
tinge
of
doleful
triumph
no
it
s
not
simple
she
assented
one
must
think
of
others
he
continued
gathering
faith
in
his
argument
as
he
saw
her
reduced
to
acquiescence
she
made
no
answer
and
after
a
moment
he
rose
to
go
so
far
in
retrospect
she
could
follow
the
course
of
their
talk
but
when
in
the
act
of
parting
argument
lapsed
into
entreaty
and
renunciation
into
the
passionate
appeal
to
give
him
at
least
one
more
hearing
her
memory
lost
itself
in
a
tumult
of
pain
and
she
recalled
only
that
when
the
door
closed
on
him
he
took
with
him
her
promise
to
see
him
once
again
iv
she
had
promised
to
see
him
again
but
the
promise
did
not
imply
that
she
had
rejected
his
offer
of
freedom
in
the
first
rush
of
misery
she
had
not
fully
repossessed
herself
had
felt
herself
entangled
in
his
fate
by
a
hundred
meshes
of
association
and
habit
but
after
a
sleepless
night
spent
with
the
thought
of
him
that
dreadful
bridal
of
their
souls
she
woke
to
a
morrow
in
which
he
had
no
part
she
had
not
sought
her
freedom
nor
had
he
given
it
but
a
chasm
had
opened
at
their
feet
and
they
found
themselves
on
different
sides
now
she
was
able
to
scan
the
disaster
from
the
melancholy
vantage
of
her
independence
she
could
even
draw
a
solace
from
the
fact
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
denis
it
was
inconceivable
that
an
emotion
so
interwoven
with
every
fibre
of
consciousness
should
cease
as
suddenly
as
the
flow
of
sap
in
an
uprooted
plant
but
she
had
never
allowed
herself
to
be
tricked
by
the
current
phraseology
of
sentiment
and
there
were
no
stock
axioms
to
protect
her
from
the
truth
it
was
probably
because
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
that
she
could
look
forward
with
a
kind
of
ghastly
composure
to
seeing
him
again
she
had
stipulated
of
course
that
the
wedding
should
be
put
off
but
she
had
named
no
other
condition
beyond
asking
for
two
days
to
herself
two
days
during
which
he
was
not
even
to
write
she
wished
to
shut
herself
in
with
her
misery
to
accustom
herself
to
it
as
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
happiness
but
actual
seclusion
was
impossible
the
subtle
reactions
of
life
almost
at
once
began
to
break
down
her
defences
she
could
no
more
have
her
wretchedness
to
herself
than
any
other
emotion
all
the
lives
about
her
were
so
many
unconscious
factors
in
her
sensations
she
tried
to
concentrate
herself
on
the
thought
as
to
how
she
could
best
help
poor
denis
for
love
in
ebbing
had
laid
bare
an
unsuspected
depth
of
pity
but
she
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
consider
his
situation
in
the
abstract
light
of
right
and
wrong
open
expiation
still
seemed
to
her
the
only
possible
way
of
healing
but
she
tried
vainly
to
think
of
peyton
as
taking
such
a
view
yet
peyton
ought
at
least
to
know
what
had
happened
was
it
not
in
the
last
resort
she
who
should
pronounce
on
her
son
s
course
for
a
moment
kate
was
fascinated
by
this
evasion
of
responsibility
she
had
nearly
decided
to
tell
denis
that
he
must
begin
by
confessing
everything
to
his
mother
but
almost
at
once
she
began
to
shrink
from
the
consequences
there
was
nothing
she
so
dreaded
for
him
as
that
any
one
should
take
a
light
view
of
his
act
should
turn
its
irremediableness
into
an
excuse
and
this
she
foresaw
was
what
peyton
would
do
the
first
burst
of
misery
over
she
would
envelop
the
whole
situation
in
a
mist
of
expediency
brought
to
the
bar
of
kate
s
judgment
she
at
once
revealed
herself
incapable
of
higher
action
kate
s
conception
of
her
was
still
under
arraignment
when
the
actual
peyton
fluttered
in
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
as
the
girl
phrased
it
in
the
dismal
of
her
universe
she
had
been
thinking
so
hard
of
peyton
that
the
lady
s
silvery
insubstantial
presence
seemed
hardly
more
than
a
projection
of
the
thought
but
as
kate
collected
herself
and
regained
contact
with
the
outer
world
her
preoccupation
yielded
to
surprise
it
was
unusual
for
peyton
to
pay
visits
for
years
she
had
remained
enthroned
in
a
which
prohibited
effort
while
it
did
not
preclude
diversion
and
the
girl
at
once
divined
a
special
purpose
in
her
coming
peyton
s
traditions
would
not
have
permitted
any
direct
method
of
attack
and
kate
had
to
sit
through
the
usual
prelude
of
ejaculation
and
anecdote
presently
however
the
elder
lady
s
voice
gathered
significance
and
laying
her
hand
on
kate
s
she
murmured
i
have
come
to
talk
to
you
of
this
sad
kate
began
to
tremble
was
it
possible
that
denis
had
after
all
spoken
a
rising
hope
checked
her
utterance
and
she
saw
in
a
flash
that
it
still
lay
with
him
to
regain
his
hold
on
her
but
peyton
went
on
delicately
it
has
been
a
great
shock
to
my
poor
boy
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
arthur
s
past
was
in
itself
inexpressibly
painful
but
this
last
dreadful
business
that
woman
s
wicked
act
wicked
kate
exclaimed
peyton
s
gentle
stare
reproved
her
surely
religion
teaches
us
that
suicide
is
a
sin
and
to
murder
her
child
i
ought
not
to
speak
to
you
of
such
things
my
dear
no
one
has
ever
mentioned
anything
so
dreadful
in
my
presence
my
dear
husband
used
to
screen
me
so
carefully
from
the
painful
side
of
life
where
there
is
so
much
that
is
beautiful
to
dwell
upon
we
should
try
to
ignore
the
existence
of
such
horrors
but
nowadays
everything
is
in
the
papers
and
denis
told
me
he
thought
it
better
that
you
should
hear
the
news
first
from
kate
nodded
without
speaking
he
felt
how
it
was
to
have
to
tell
you
but
i
tell
him
he
takes
a
morbid
view
of
the
case
of
course
one
is
shocked
at
the
woman
s
crime
but
if
one
looks
a
little
deeper
how
can
one
help
seeing
that
it
may
have
been
designed
as
the
means
of
rescuing
that
poor
child
from
a
life
of
vice
and
misery
that
is
the
view
i
want
denis
to
take
i
want
him
to
see
how
all
the
difficulties
of
life
disappear
when
one
has
learned
to
look
for
a
divine
purpose
in
human
peyton
rested
a
moment
on
this
period
as
an
experienced
climber
pauses
to
be
overtaken
by
a
less
agile
companion
but
presently
she
became
aware
that
kate
was
still
far
below
her
and
perhaps
needed
a
stronger
incentive
to
the
ascent
my
dear
child
she
said
adroitly
i
said
just
now
that
i
was
sorry
you
had
been
obliged
to
hear
of
this
sad
affair
but
after
all
it
is
only
you
who
can
avert
its
kate
drew
an
eager
breath
its
consequences
she
faltered
peyton
s
voice
dropped
solemnly
denis
has
told
me
everything
she
said
everything
that
you
insist
on
putting
off
the
marriage
oh
my
dear
i
do
implore
you
to
reconsider
that
kate
sank
back
with
the
sense
of
having
passed
again
into
a
region
of
leaden
shadow
is
that
all
he
told
you
peyton
gazed
at
her
with
arch
raillery
all
isn
t
it
everything
to
him
did
he
give
you
my
reason
i
mean
he
said
you
felt
that
after
this
shocking
tragedy
there
ought
in
decency
to
be
a
delay
and
i
quite
understand
the
feeling
it
does
seem
too
unfortunate
that
the
woman
should
have
chosen
this
particular
time
but
you
will
find
as
you
grow
older
that
life
is
full
of
such
sad
kate
felt
herself
slowly
petrifying
under
the
warm
drip
of
peyton
s
platitudes
it
seems
to
me
the
elder
lady
continued
that
there
is
only
one
point
from
which
we
ought
to
consider
the
question
and
that
is
its
effect
on
denis
but
for
that
we
ought
to
refuse
to
know
anything
about
it
but
it
has
made
my
boy
so
unhappy
the
was
a
cruel
ordeal
to
him
the
dreadful
notoriety
the
revelation
of
poor
arthur
s
infirmities
denis
is
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
it
is
his
unusual
refinement
of
feeling
that
makes
him
so
worthy
of
being
loved
by
you
but
such
sensitiveness
may
be
carried
to
excess
he
ought
not
to
let
this
unhappy
incident
prey
on
him
it
shows
a
lack
of
trust
in
the
divine
ordering
of
things
that
is
what
troubles
me
his
faith
in
life
has
been
shaken
and
you
must
forgive
me
dear
child
you
forgive
me
i
know
but
i
can
t
help
blaming
you
a
little
peyton
s
accent
converted
the
accusation
into
a
caress
which
prolonged
itself
in
a
tremulous
pressure
of
kate
s
hand
the
girl
gazed
at
her
blankly
you
blame
don
t
be
offended
my
child
i
only
fear
that
your
excessive
sympathy
with
denis
your
own
delicacy
of
feeling
may
have
led
you
to
encourage
his
morbid
ideas
he
tells
me
you
were
very
much
shocked
as
you
naturally
would
be
as
any
girl
must
be
i
would
not
have
you
otherwise
dear
kate
it
is
that
you
should
both
feel
so
most
beautiful
but
you
know
religion
teaches
us
not
to
yield
too
much
to
our
grief
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
the
living
owe
themselves
to
each
other
and
what
had
this
wretched
woman
to
do
with
either
of
you
it
is
a
misfortune
for
denis
to
have
been
connected
in
any
way
with
a
man
of
arthur
peyton
s
character
but
after
all
poor
arthur
did
all
he
could
to
atone
for
the
disgrace
he
brought
on
us
by
making
denis
his
heir
and
i
am
sure
i
have
no
wish
to
question
the
decrees
of
peyton
paused
again
and
then
softly
absorbed
both
of
kate
s
hands
for
my
part
she
continued
i
see
in
it
another
instance
of
the
beautiful
ordering
of
events
just
after
dear
denis
s
inheritance
has
removed
the
last
obstacle
to
your
marriage
this
sad
incident
comes
to
show
how
desperately
he
needs
you
how
cruel
it
would
be
to
ask
him
to
defer
his
she
broke
off
shaken
out
of
her
habitual
placidity
by
the
abrupt
withdrawal
of
the
girl
s
hands
kate
sat
inertly
staring
but
no
answer
rose
to
her
lips
at
length
peyton
resumed
gathering
her
draperies
about
her
with
a
tentative
hint
of
i
may
go
home
and
tell
him
that
you
will
not
put
off
the
wedding
kate
was
still
silent
and
her
visitor
looked
at
her
with
the
mild
surprise
of
an
advocate
unaccustomed
to
plead
in
vain
if
your
silence
means
refusal
my
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
realize
the
responsibility
you
peyton
s
voice
had
acquired
an
edge
of
righteous
asperity
if
denis
has
a
fault
it
is
that
he
is
too
gentle
too
yielding
too
readily
influenced
by
those
he
cares
for
your
influence
is
paramount
with
him
now
but
if
you
turn
from
him
just
when
he
needs
your
help
who
can
say
what
the
result
will
be
the
argument
though
impressively
delivered
was
hardly
of
a
nature
to
carry
conviction
to
its
hearer
but
it
was
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
that
she
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
replied
to
it
by
sinking
back
into
her
seat
with
a
burst
of
tears
to
peyton
however
tears
were
the
signal
of
surrender
and
at
kate
s
side
in
an
instant
she
hastened
to
temper
her
triumph
with
magnanimity
don
t
think
i
don
t
feel
with
you
but
we
must
both
forget
ourselves
for
our
boy
s
sake
i
told
him
i
should
come
back
with
your
the
arm
she
had
slipped
about
kate
s
shoulder
fell
back
with
the
girl
s
start
kate
had
seen
in
a
flash
what
capital
would
be
made
of
her
emotion
no
no
you
misunderstand
me
i
can
make
no
promise
she
declared
the
older
lady
sat
a
moment
irresolute
then
she
restored
her
arm
to
the
shoulder
from
which
it
had
been
so
abruptly
displaced
my
dear
child
she
said
in
a
tone
of
tender
confidence
if
i
have
misunderstood
you
ought
you
not
to
enlighten
me
you
asked
me
just
now
if
denis
had
given
me
your
reason
for
this
strange
postponement
he
gave
me
one
reason
but
it
seems
hardly
sufficient
to
explain
your
conduct
if
there
is
any
other
and
i
know
you
well
enough
to
feel
sure
there
is
will
you
not
trust
me
with
it
if
my
boy
has
been
unhappy
enough
to
displease
you
will
you
not
give
his
mother
the
chance
to
plead
his
cause
remember
no
one
should
be
condemned
unheard
as
denis
s
mother
i
have
the
right
to
ask
for
your
my
reason
my
reason
kate
stammered
panting
with
the
exhaustion
of
the
struggle
oh
if
only
peyton
would
release
her
if
you
have
the
right
to
know
it
why
doesn
t
he
tell
you
she
cried
peyton
stood
up
quivering
i
will
go
home
and
ask
him
she
said
i
will
tell
him
he
had
your
permission
to
she
moved
toward
the
door
with
the
nervous
haste
of
a
person
unaccustomed
to
decisive
action
but
kate
sprang
before
her
no
no
don
t
ask
him
i
implore
you
not
to
ask
him
she
cried
peyton
turned
on
her
with
sudden
authority
of
voice
and
gesture
do
i
understand
you
she
said
you
admit
that
you
have
a
reason
for
putting
off
your
marriage
and
yet
you
forbid
me
me
denis
s
mother
to
ask
him
what
it
is
my
poor
child
i
needn
t
ask
for
i
know
already
if
he
has
offended
you
and
you
refuse
him
the
chance
to
defend
himself
i
needn
t
look
farther
for
your
reason
it
is
simply
that
you
have
ceased
to
love
kate
fell
back
from
the
door
which
she
had
instinctively
barricaded
perhaps
that
is
it
she
murmured
letting
peyton
pass
orme
s
returning
crossed
peyton
s
indignant
flight
and
an
hour
later
kate
in
the
bland
of
the
sat
listening
with
practised
fortitude
to
her
father
s
comments
on
the
venison
she
had
wondered
as
she
awaited
him
in
the
if
he
would
notice
any
change
in
her
appearance
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
flagellation
of
her
thoughts
must
have
left
visible
traces
but
orme
was
not
a
man
of
subtle
perceptions
save
where
his
personal
comfort
was
affected
though
his
egoism
was
clothed
in
the
finest
feelers
he
did
not
suspect
a
similar
surface
in
others
his
daughter
as
part
of
himself
came
within
the
normal
range
of
his
solicitude
but
she
was
an
outlying
region
a
subject
province
and
orme
s
was
a
highly
centralized
polity
news
of
the
painful
incident
he
often
used
peyton
s
vocabulary
had
reached
him
at
his
club
and
to
some
extent
disturbed
the
assimilation
of
a
carefully
ordered
breakfast
but
since
then
two
days
had
passed
and
it
did
not
take
orme
hours
to
resign
himself
to
the
misfortunes
of
others
it
was
all
very
nasty
of
course
and
he
wished
to
heaven
it
hadn
t
happened
to
any
one
about
to
be
connected
with
him
but
he
viewed
it
with
the
transient
annoyance
of
a
gentleman
who
has
been
splashed
by
the
mud
of
a
fatal
runaway
orme
affected
under
such
circumstances
a
bluff
and
hearty
stoicism
as
remote
as
possible
from
peyton
s
deprecating
evasion
of
facts
it
was
a
bad
business
he
was
sorry
kate
should
have
been
mixed
up
with
it
but
she
would
be
married
soon
now
and
then
she
would
see
that
life
wasn
t
exactly
a
story
everybody
was
exposed
to
such
disagreeable
accidents
he
remembered
a
case
in
their
own
family
oh
a
distant
cousin
whom
kate
wouldn
t
have
heard
of
a
poor
fellow
who
had
got
entangled
with
just
such
a
woman
and
having
most
properly
been
sent
packing
by
his
father
had
justified
the
latter
s
course
by
promptly
forging
his
name
a
very
nasty
affair
altogether
but
luckily
the
scandal
had
been
hushed
up
the
woman
bought
off
and
the
prodigal
after
a
season
of
probation
safely
married
to
a
nice
girl
with
a
good
income
who
was
told
by
the
family
that
the
doctors
recommended
his
settling
in
california
the
scandal
was
hushed
the
phrase
blazed
out
against
the
dark
background
of
kate
s
misery
that
was
doubtless
what
most
people
felt
the
words
represented
the
consensus
of
respectable
opinion
the
best
way
of
repairing
a
fault
was
to
hide
it
to
tear
up
the
floor
and
bury
the
victim
at
night
above
all
no
coroner
and
no
autopsy
she
began
to
feel
a
strange
interest
in
her
distant
cousin
and
his
wife
did
she
know
what
he
had
done
orme
stared
his
moral
pointed
he
had
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
his
own
affairs
his
wife
oh
of
course
not
the
secret
has
been
most
admirably
kept
but
her
property
was
put
in
trust
so
she
s
quite
safe
with
her
property
kate
wondered
if
her
faith
in
her
husband
had
also
been
put
in
trust
if
her
sensibilities
had
been
protected
from
his
possible
inroads
do
you
think
it
quite
fair
to
have
deceived
her
in
that
way
orme
gave
her
a
puzzled
glance
he
had
no
taste
for
the
of
ethical
conjecture
his
people
wanted
to
give
the
poor
fellow
another
chance
they
did
the
best
they
could
for
and
he
has
done
nothing
dishonourable
since
not
that
i
know
of
the
last
i
heard
was
that
they
had
a
little
boy
and
that
he
was
quite
happy
at
that
distance
he
s
not
likely
to
bother
at
all
long
after
orme
had
left
the
topic
kate
remained
lost
in
its
contemplation
she
had
begun
to
perceive
that
the
fair
surface
of
life
was
honeycombed
by
a
vast
system
of
moral
sewage
every
respectable
household
had
its
special
arrangements
for
the
private
disposal
of
family
scandals
it
was
only
among
the
reckless
and
improvident
that
such
hygienic
precautions
were
neglected
who
was
she
to
pass
judgment
on
the
merits
of
such
a
system
the
social
health
must
be
preserved
the
means
devised
were
the
result
of
long
experience
and
the
collective
instinct
of
she
had
meant
to
tell
her
father
that
evening
that
her
marriage
had
been
put
off
but
she
now
abstained
from
doing
so
not
from
any
doubt
of
orme
s
acquiescence
he
could
always
be
made
to
feel
the
force
of
conventional
scruples
but
because
the
whole
question
sank
into
insignificance
beside
the
larger
issue
which
his
words
had
raised
in
her
own
room
that
night
she
passed
through
that
travail
of
the
soul
of
which
the
deeper
life
is
born
her
first
sense
was
of
a
great
moral
loneliness
an
isolation
more
complete
more
impenetrable
than
that
in
which
the
discovery
of
denis
s
act
had
plunged
her
for
she
had
vaguely
leaned
then
on
a
collective
sense
of
justice
that
should
respond
to
her
own
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
she
still
believed
in
the
logical
correspondence
of
theory
and
practice
now
she
saw
that
among
those
nearest
her
there
was
no
one
who
recognized
the
moral
need
of
expiation
she
saw
that
to
take
her
father
or
peyton
into
her
confidence
would
be
but
to
widen
the
circle
of
sterile
misery
in
which
she
and
denis
moved
at
first
the
aspect
of
life
thus
revealed
to
her
seemed
simply
mean
and
base
a
world
where
honour
was
a
pact
of
silence
between
adroit
accomplices
the
network
of
circumstance
had
tightened
round
her
and
every
effort
to
escape
drew
its
meshes
closer
but
as
her
struggles
subsided
she
felt
the
spiritual
release
which
comes
with
acceptance
not
connivance
in
dishonour
but
recognition
of
evil
out
of
that
dark
vision
light
was
to
come
the
shaft
of
cloud
turning
to
the
pillar
of
fire
for
here
at
last
life
lay
before
her
as
it
was
not
brave
garlanded
and
victorious
but
naked
grovelling
and
diseased
dragging
its
maimed
limbs
through
the
mud
yet
lifting
piteous
hands
to
the
stars
love
itself
once
throned
aloft
on
an
altar
of
dreams
how
it
stole
to
her
now
and
scarred
pleading
for
the
shelter
of
her
breast
love
indeed
not
in
the
old
sense
in
which
she
had
conceived
it
but
a
graver
austerer
presence
the
charity
of
the
mystic
three
she
thought
she
had
ceased
to
love
denis
but
what
had
she
loved
in
him
but
her
happiness
and
his
their
affection
had
been
the
of
the
canticles
where
they
were
to
walk
forever
in
a
delicate
isolation
of
bliss
but
now
love
appeared
to
her
as
something
more
than
this
something
wider
deeper
more
enduring
than
the
selfish
passion
of
a
man
and
a
woman
she
saw
it
in
all
its
issues
till
the
first
meeting
of
two
pairs
of
young
eyes
kindled
a
light
which
might
be
a
beacon
across
dark
waters
of
humanity
all
this
did
not
come
to
her
clearly
consecutively
but
in
a
series
of
blurred
and
shifting
images
marriage
had
meant
to
her
as
it
means
to
girls
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
life
simply
the
exquisite
prolongation
of
wooing
if
she
had
looked
beyond
to
the
vision
of
wider
ties
it
was
as
a
traveller
gazes
over
a
land
veiled
in
golden
haze
and
so
far
distant
that
the
imagination
delays
to
explore
it
but
now
through
the
blur
of
sensations
one
image
strangely
persisted
the
image
of
denis
s
child
had
she
ever
before
thought
of
their
having
a
child
she
could
not
remember
she
was
like
one
who
wakens
from
a
long
fever
she
recalled
nothing
of
her
former
self
or
of
her
former
feelings
she
knew
only
that
the
vision
persisted
the
vision
of
the
child
whose
mother
she
was
not
to
be
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
marry
denis
her
inmost
soul
rejected
him
but
it
was
just
because
she
was
not
to
be
the
child
s
mother
that
its
image
followed
her
so
pleadingly
for
she
saw
with
perfect
clearness
the
inevitable
course
of
events
denis
would
marry
some
one
else
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
are
fated
to
marry
and
she
needed
not
his
mother
s
reminder
that
her
abandonment
of
him
at
an
emotional
crisis
would
fling
him
upon
the
first
sympathy
within
reach
he
would
marry
a
girl
who
knew
nothing
of
his
secret
for
kate
was
intensely
aware
that
he
would
never
again
willingly
confess
himself
he
would
marry
a
girl
who
trusted
him
and
leaned
on
him
as
she
kate
orme
the
earlier
kate
orme
had
done
but
two
days
since
and
with
this
deception
between
them
their
child
would
be
born
born
to
an
inheritance
of
secret
weakness
a
vice
of
the
moral
fibre
as
it
might
be
born
with
some
hidden
physical
taint
which
would
destroy
it
before
the
cause
should
be
detected
well
and
what
of
it
was
she
to
hold
herself
responsible
were
not
thousands
of
children
born
with
some
such
unsuspected
taint
ah
but
if
here
was
one
that
she
could
save
what
if
she
who
had
had
so
exquisite
a
vision
of
wifehood
should
reconstruct
from
its
ruins
this
vision
of
protecting
maternity
if
her
love
for
her
lover
should
be
not
lost
but
transformed
enlarged
into
this
passion
of
charity
for
his
race
if
she
might
expiate
and
redeem
his
fault
by
becoming
a
refuge
from
its
consequences
before
this
strange
extension
of
her
love
all
the
old
limitations
seemed
to
fall
something
had
cleft
the
surface
of
self
and
there
welled
up
the
mysterious
primal
influences
the
sacrificial
instinct
of
her
sex
a
passion
of
spiritual
motherhood
that
made
her
long
to
fling
herself
between
the
unborn
child
and
its
fate
she
never
knew
then
or
after
how
she
reached
this
mystic
climax
of
effacement
she
was
only
conscious
through
her
anguish
of
that
lift
of
the
heart
which
made
one
of
the
saints
declare
that
joy
was
the
inmost
core
of
sorrow
for
it
was
indeed
a
kind
of
joy
she
felt
if
old
names
must
serve
for
such
new
meanings
a
surge
of
liberating
faith
in
life
the
old
quia
which
is
the
secret
cry
of
all
supreme
endeavour

nice
mother
dick
peyton
met
her
with
the
question
on
the
threshold
drawing
her
gaily
into
the
little
square
room
and
adding
with
a
laugh
with
a
blush
in
it
you
know
she
s
an
uncommonly
noticing
person
and
little
things

swung
round
on
his
heel
to
follow
his
mother
s
smiling
inspection
of
the
apartment
she
seems
to
have
the
qualities
denis
peyton
remarked
as
her
circuit
finally
brought
her
to
the
prettily
appointed
he
declared
taking
the
sting
from
her
emphasis
by
his
prompt
adoption
of
it
dick
had
always
had
a
wholesome
way
of
thus
appropriating
to
his
own
use
such
small
shafts
of
maternal
irony
as
were
now
and
then
aimed
at
him
kate
peyton
laughed
and
loosened
her
furs
it
looks
charmingly
she
pronounced
ending
her
survey
by
an
approach
to
the
window
which
gave
far
below
the
oblique
perspective
of
a
long
leading
to
fifth
avenue
the
room
was
dick
peyton
s
private
office
a
retreat
partitioned
off
from
the
larger
enclosure
in
which
under
a
north
light
and
on
a
range
of
deal
tables
three
or
four
young
draughtsmen
were
busily
engaged
in
elaborating
his
architectural
projects
the
outer
door
of
the
office
bore
the
sign
and
gill
but
gill
was
an
utilitarian
person
as
unobtrusive
as
his
name
who
contented
himself
with
a
desk
in
the
workroom
and
left
dick
to
lord
it
alone
in
the
small
apartment
to
which
clients
were
introduced
and
where
the
social
part
of
the
business
was
carried
on
it
was
to
serve
on
this
occasion
as
the
scene
of
a
tea
designed
as
kate
peyton
was
vividly
aware
to
introduce
a
certain
young
lady
to
the
scene
of
her
son
s
labours
peyton
had
been
hearing
a
great
deal
lately
about
clemence
verney
dick
was
naturally
expansive
and
his
close
intimacy
with
his
mother
an
intimacy
fostered
by
his
father
s
early
death
if
it
had
suffered
some
natural
impairment
in
his
school
and
college
days
had
of
late
been
revived
by
four
years
of
comradeship
in
paris
where
peyton
in
a
tiny
apartment
of
the
rue
de
varennes
had
kept
house
for
him
during
his
course
of
studies
at
the
beaux
arts
there
were
indeed
not
lacking
critics
of
her
own
sex
who
accused
kate
peyton
of
having
figured
too
largely
in
her
son
s
life
of
having
failed
to
efface
herself
at
a
period
when
it
is
agreed
that
young
men
are
best
left
free
to
try
conclusions
with
the
world
peyton
had
she
cared
to
defend
herself
might
have
said
that
dick
if
communicative
was
not
impressionable
and
that
the
closeness
of
texture
which
enabled
him
to
throw
off
her
sarcasms
preserved
him
also
from
the
infiltration
of
her
prejudices
he
was
certainly
no
knight
of
the
but
a
seemingly
resolute
and
young
man
whose
romantic
friendship
with
his
mother
had
merely
served
to
throw
a
veil
of
suavity
over
the
hard
angles
of
youth
but
peyton
s
real
excuse
was
after
all
one
which
she
would
never
have
given
it
was
because
her
intimacy
with
her
son
was
the
one
need
of
her
life
that
she
had
with
infinite
tact
and
discretion
but
with
equal
persistency
clung
to
every
step
of
his
growth
dissembling
herself
adapting
herself
rejuvenating
herself
in
the
passionate
effort
to
be
always
within
reach
but
never
in
the
way
denis
peyton
had
died
after
seven
years
of
marriage
when
his
boy
was
barely
six
during
those
seven
years
he
had
managed
to
squander
the
best
part
of
the
fortune
he
had
inherited
from
his
so
that
at
his
death
his
widow
and
son
were
left
with
a
scant
competence
peyton
during
her
husband
s
life
had
apparently
made
no
effort
to
restrain
his
expenditure
she
had
even
been
accused
by
those
judicious
persons
who
are
always
ready
with
an
estimate
of
their
neighbours
motives
of
having
encouraged
poor
denis
s
improvidence
for
the
gratification
of
her
own
ambition
she
had
in
fact
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
tried
to
launch
him
in
politics
and
had
perhaps
drawn
somewhat
heavily
on
his
funds
in
the
first
heat
of
the
contest
but
the
experiment
ending
in
failure
as
denis
peyton
s
experiments
were
apt
to
end
she
had
made
no
farther
demands
on
his
exchequer
her
personal
tastes
were
in
fact
unusually
simple
but
her
outspoken
indifference
to
money
was
not
in
the
opinion
of
her
critics
designed
to
act
as
a
check
upon
her
husband
and
it
resulted
in
leaving
her
at
his
death
in
straits
from
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
deduce
a
moral
her
small
means
and
the
care
of
the
boy
s
education
served
the
widow
as
a
pretext
for
secluding
herself
in
a
socially
remote
suburb
where
it
was
inferred
that
she
was
expiating
on
queer
food
and
in
boots
her
rash
defiance
of
fortune
whether
or
not
peyton
s
penance
took
this
form
she
hoarded
her
substance
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
was
not
only
able
to
give
dick
the
best
of
schooling
but
to
propose
on
his
leaving
harvard
that
he
should
prolong
his
studies
by
another
four
years
at
the
beaux
arts
it
had
been
the
joy
of
her
life
that
her
boy
had
early
shown
a
marked
bent
for
a
special
line
of
work
she
could
not
have
borne
to
see
him
reduced
to
a
mere
yet
she
was
not
sorry
that
their
small
means
forbade
the
cultivation
of
an
ornamental
leisure
in
his
college
days
dick
had
troubled
her
by
a
superabundance
of
tastes
a
restless
flitting
from
one
form
of
artistic
expression
to
another
whatever
art
he
enjoyed
he
wished
to
practise
and
he
passed
from
music
to
painting
from
painting
to
architecture
with
an
ease
which
seemed
to
his
mother
to
indicate
lack
of
purpose
rather
than
excess
of
talent
she
had
observed
that
these
changes
were
usually
due
not
to
but
to
some
external
discouragement
any
depreciation
of
his
work
was
enough
to
convince
him
of
the
uselessness
of
pursuing
that
special
form
of
art
and
the
reaction
produced
the
immediate
conviction
that
he
was
really
destined
to
shine
in
some
other
line
of
work
he
had
thus
swung
from
one
calling
to
another
till
at
the
end
of
his
college
career
his
mother
took
the
decisive
step
of
transplanting
him
to
the
beaux
arts
in
the
hope
that
a
definite
course
of
study
combined
with
the
stimulus
of
competition
might
fix
his
wavering
aptitudes
the
result
justified
her
expectation
and
their
four
years
in
the
rue
de
varennes
yielded
the
happiest
confirmation
of
her
belief
in
him
dick
s
ability
was
recognized
not
only
by
his
mother
but
by
his
professors
he
was
engrossed
in
his
work
and
his
first
successes
developed
his
capacity
for
application
his
mother
s
only
fear
was
that
praise
was
still
too
necessary
to
him
she
was
uncertain
how
long
his
ambition
would
sustain
him
in
the
face
of
failure
he
gave
lavishly
where
he
was
sure
of
a
return
but
it
remained
to
be
seen
if
he
were
capable
of
production
without
recognition
she
had
brought
him
up
in
a
wholesome
scorn
of
material
rewards
and
nature
seemed
in
this
direction
to
have
seconded
her
training
he
was
genuinely
indifferent
to
money
and
his
enjoyment
of
beauty
was
of
that
happy
sort
which
does
not
generate
the
wish
for
possession
as
long
as
the
inner
eye
had
food
for
contemplation
he
cared
very
little
for
the
deficiencies
in
his
surroundings
or
it
might
rather
be
said
he
felt
in
the
of
beauty
about
him
an
ownership
of
appreciation
that
left
him
free
from
the
fret
of
personal
desire
peyton
had
cultivated
to
excess
this
disregard
of
material
conditions
but
she
now
began
to
ask
herself
whether
in
so
doing
she
had
not
laid
too
great
a
strain
on
a
temperament
naturally
exalted
in
guarding
against
other
tendencies
she
had
perhaps
fostered
in
him
too
exclusively
those
qualities
which
circumstances
had
brought
to
an
unusual
development
in
herself
his
enthusiasms
and
his
disdains
were
alike
too
unqualified
for
that
happy
mean
of
character
which
is
the
best
defence
against
the
surprises
of
fortune
if
she
had
taught
him
to
set
an
exaggerated
value
on
ideal
rewards
was
not
that
but
a
shifting
of
the
on
which
her
fears
had
always
hung
she
trembled
sometimes
to
think
how
little
love
and
a
lifelong
vigilance
had
availed
in
the
deflecting
of
inherited
tendencies
her
fears
were
in
a
measure
confirmed
by
the
first
two
years
of
their
life
in
new
york
and
the
opening
of
his
career
as
a
professional
architect
close
on
the
easy
triumphs
of
his
studentships
there
came
the
chilling
reaction
of
public
indifference
dick
on
his
return
from
paris
had
formed
a
partnership
with
an
architect
who
had
had
several
years
of
practical
training
in
a
new
york
office
but
the
quiet
and
industrious
gill
though
he
attracted
to
the
new
firm
a
few
small
jobs
which
overflowed
from
the
business
of
his
former
employer
was
not
able
to
infect
the
public
with
his
own
faith
in
peyton
s
talents
and
it
was
trying
to
a
genius
who
felt
himself
capable
of
creating
palaces
to
have
to
restrict
his
efforts
to
the
building
of
suburban
cottages
or
the
planning
of
cheap
alterations
in
private
houses
peyton
expended
all
the
ingenuities
of
tenderness
in
keeping
up
her
son
s
courage
and
she
was
seconded
in
the
task
by
a
friend
whose
acquaintance
dick
had
made
at
the
beaux
arts
and
who
two
years
before
the
peytons
had
returned
to
new
york
to
start
on
his
own
career
as
an
architect
paul
darrow
was
a
young
man
full
of
crude
seriousness
who
after
a
youth
of
struggling
work
and
study
in
his
native
northwestern
state
had
won
a
scholarship
which
sent
him
abroad
for
a
course
at
the
beaux
arts
his
two
years
there
coincided
with
the
first
part
of
dick
s
residence
and
darrow
s
gifts
had
at
once
attracted
the
younger
student
dick
was
unstinted
in
his
admiration
of
rival
talent
and
peyton
who
was
romantically
given
to
the
cultivation
of
such
generosities
had
seconded
his
enthusiasm
by
the
kindest
offers
of
hospitality
to
the
young
student
darrow
thus
became
the
grateful
frequenter
of
their
little
and
after
their
return
to
new
york
the
intimacy
between
the
young
men
was
renewed
though
peyton
found
it
more
difficult
to
coax
dick
s
friend
to
her
new
york
than
to
the
informal
surroundings
of
the
rue
de
varennes
there
no
doubt
secluded
and
absorbed
in
her
son
s
work
she
had
seemed
to
darrow
almost
a
but
seen
among
her
own
associates
she
became
once
more
the
woman
of
fashion
divided
from
him
by
the
whole
breadth
of
her
ease
and
his
awkwardness
peyton
whose
tact
had
divined
the
cause
of
his
estrangement
would
not
for
an
instant
let
it
affect
the
friendship
of
the
two
young
men
she
encouraged
dick
to
frequent
darrow
in
whom
she
divined
a
persistency
of
effort
an
artistic
in
curious
contrast
to
his
social
hesitancies
the
example
of
his
obstinate
capacity
for
work
was
just
the
influence
her
son
needed
and
if
darrow
would
not
come
to
them
she
insisted
that
dick
must
seek
him
out
must
never
let
him
think
that
any
social
discrepancy
could
affect
a
friendship
based
on
deeper
things
dick
who
had
all
the
loyalties
and
who
took
an
honest
pride
in
his
friend
s
growing
success
needed
no
urging
to
maintain
the
intimacy
and
his
copious
reports
of
midnight
colloquies
in
darrow
s
lodgings
showed
peyton
that
she
had
a
strong
ally
in
her
invisible
friend
it
had
been
therefore
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
learn
in
the
course
of
time
that
darrow
s
influence
was
being
shared
if
not
counteracted
by
that
of
a
young
lady
in
whose
honour
dick
was
now
giving
his
first
professional
tea
peyton
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
miss
clemence
verney
first
from
the
usual
purveyors
of
such
information
and
more
recently
from
her
son
who
probably
divining
that
rumour
had
been
before
him
adopted
his
usual
method
of
disarming
his
mother
by
taking
her
into
his
confidence
but
ample
as
her
information
was
it
remained
perplexing
and
contradictory
and
even
her
own
few
meetings
with
the
girl
had
not
helped
her
to
a
definite
opinion
miss
verney
in
conduct
and
ideas
was
patently
of
the
new
school
a
young
woman
of
feverish
activities
and
judgments
whose
very
versatility
made
her
hard
to
define
peyton
was
shrewd
enough
to
allow
for
the
accidents
of
environment
what
she
wished
to
get
at
was
the
residuum
of
character
beneath
miss
verney
s
shifting
surface
it
looks
charmingly
peyton
repeated
giving
a
loosening
touch
to
the
chrysanthemums
in
a
tall
vase
on
her
son
s
desk
dick
laughed
and
glanced
at
his
watch
they
won
t
be
here
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
i
think
i
ll
tell
gill
to
clean
out
the
before
they
are
we
to
see
the
drawings
for
the
competition
his
mother
asked
he
shook
his
head
smilingly
can
t
i
ve
asked
one
or
two
of
the
beaux
arts
fellows
you
know
and
besides
old
darrow
s
actually
impossible
peyton
exclaimed
he
swore
he
would
last
dick
laughed
again
with
a
tinge
of
i
ve
an
idea
he
wants
to
see
miss
ah
his
mother
murmured
there
was
a
pause
before
she
added
has
darrow
really
gone
in
for
this
competition
rather
i
should
say
so
he
s
simply
working
himself
to
the
peyton
sat
revolving
her
muff
on
a
meditative
hand
at
length
she
said
i
m
not
sure
i
think
it
quite
nice
of
her
son
halted
before
her
with
an
incredulous
stare
he
exclaimed
the
rebuke
sent
a
blush
to
her
forehead
well
considering
your
friendship
and
everything
what
do
you
mean
by
everything
the
fact
that
he
had
more
ability
than
i
have
and
is
therefore
more
likely
to
succeed
the
fact
that
he
needs
the
money
and
the
success
a
deuced
sight
more
than
any
of
us
is
that
the
reason
you
think
he
oughtn
t
to
have
entered
mother
i
never
heard
you
say
an
ungenerous
thing
the
blush
deepened
to
crimson
and
she
rose
with
a
nervous
laugh
it
ungenerous
she
conceded
i
suppose
i
m
jealous
for
you
i
hate
these
competitions
her
son
smiled
reassuringly
you
needn
t
i
m
not
afraid
i
think
i
shall
pull
it
off
this
time
in
fact
paul
s
the
only
man
i
m
afraid
of
i
m
always
afraid
of
paul
but
the
mere
fact
that
he
s
in
the
thing
is
a
tremendous
his
mother
continued
to
study
him
with
an
anxious
tenderness
have
you
worked
out
the
whole
scheme
do
you
it
yet
oh
broadly
yes
there
s
a
gap
here
and
there
a
hazy
bit
rather
it
s
the
hardest
problem
i
ve
ever
had
to
tackle
but
then
it
s
my
biggest
opportunity
and
i
ve
simply
to
pull
it
off
peyton
sat
silent
considering
his
flushed
face
and
illumined
eye
which
were
rather
those
of
the
victor
nearing
the
goal
than
of
the
runner
just
beginning
the
race
she
remembered
something
that
darrow
had
once
said
of
him
dick
always
sees
the
end
too
you
haven
t
too
much
time
left
she
murmured
just
a
week
but
i
shan
t
go
anywhere
after
this
i
shall
renounce
the
he
glanced
smilingly
at
the
festal
and
the
embowered
desk
when
i
next
appear
it
will
either
be
with
my
heel
on
paul
s
neck
poor
old
paul
or
else
or
else
being
dragged
lifeless
from
the
arena
his
mother
nervously
took
up
the
laugh
with
which
he
ended
oh
not
lifeless
she
said
his
face
clouded
well
maimed
for
life
then
he
muttered
peyton
made
no
answer
she
knew
how
much
hung
on
the
possibility
of
his
winning
the
competition
which
for
weeks
past
had
engrossed
him
it
was
a
design
for
the
new
museum
of
sculpture
for
which
the
city
had
recently
voted
half
a
million
dick
s
taste
ran
naturally
to
the
grandiose
and
the
erection
of
public
buildings
had
always
been
the
object
of
his
ambition
here
was
an
unmatched
opportunity
and
he
knew
that
in
a
competition
of
the
kind
the
newest
man
had
as
much
chance
of
success
as
the
firm
of
most
established
reputation
since
every
competitor
entered
on
his
own
merits
the
designs
being
submitted
to
a
jury
of
architects
who
voted
on
them
without
knowing
the
names
of
the
contestants
dick
characteristically
was
not
afraid
of
the
older
firms
indeed
as
he
had
told
his
mother
paul
darrow
was
the
only
rival
he
feared
peyton
knew
that
to
a
certain
point
was
a
good
sign
but
somehow
her
son
s
did
not
strike
her
as
being
of
the
right
substance
it
seemed
to
have
no
dimension
but
extent
her
fears
were
complicated
by
a
suspicion
that
under
his
professional
eagerness
for
success
lay
the
knowledge
that
miss
verney
s
favour
hung
on
the
victory
it
was
that
perhaps
which
gave
a
feverish
touch
to
his
ambition
and
peyton
surveying
the
future
from
the
height
of
her
material
apprehensions
divined
that
the
situation
depended
mainly
on
the
girl
s
view
of
it
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
clemence
verney
s
conception
of
success
ii
miss
verney
when
she
presently
appeared
in
the
wake
of
the
impersonal
and
exclamatory
young
married
woman
who
served
as
a
background
to
her
vivid
outline
seemed
competent
to
impart
at
short
notice
any
information
required
of
her
she
had
never
struck
peyton
as
more
alert
and
efficient
a
melting
grace
of
line
and
colour
tempered
her
edges
with
the
charming
haze
of
youth
but
it
occurred
to
her
critic
that
she
might
emerge
from
this
morning
mist
as
a
dry
and
metallic
old
woman
if
miss
verney
suspected
a
personal
application
in
dick
s
hospitality
it
did
not
call
forth
in
her
the
usual
tokens
of
her
manner
may
have
been
a
shade
more
vivid
than
usual
but
she
preserved
all
her
bright
composure
of
glance
and
speech
so
that
one
guessed
under
the
rapid
dispersal
of
words
an
undisturbed
steadiness
of
perception
she
was
lavishly
but
not
indiscriminately
interested
in
the
evidences
of
her
host
s
industry
and
as
the
other
guests
assembled
straying
with
vague
ejaculations
through
the
labyrinth
of
scale
drawings
and
blue
prints
peyton
noted
that
miss
verney
alone
knew
what
these
symbols
stood
for
to
his
visitors
requests
to
be
shown
his
plans
for
the
competition
peyton
had
opposed
a
laughing
refusal
enforced
by
the
presence
of
two
young
men
with
lingering
traces
of
the
beaux
arts
in
their
costume
and
vocabulary
who
stood
about
in
gavarni
attitudes
and
dazzled
the
ladies
by
allusions
to
fenestration
and
entasis
the
party
had
already
drifted
back
to
the
when
a
hesitating
knock
announced
darrow
s
approach
he
entered
with
his
usual
air
of
having
blundered
in
by
mistake
embarrassed
by
his
hat
and
and
thrown
into
deeper
confusion
by
the
necessity
of
being
introduced
to
the
ladies
grouped
about
the
urn
to
the
men
he
threw
a
gruff
nod
of
fellowship
and
dick
having
relieved
him
of
his
encumbrances
he
retreated
behind
the
shelter
of
peyton
s
welcome
the
latter
judiciously
gave
him
time
to
recover
and
when
she
turned
to
him
he
was
engaged
in
a
surreptitious
inspection
of
miss
verney
whose
dusky
slenderness
relieved
against
the
bare
walls
of
the
office
made
her
look
like
a
young
john
of
donatello
s
the
girl
returned
his
look
with
one
of
her
clear
glances
and
the
group
having
presently
broken
up
again
peyton
saw
that
she
had
drifted
to
darrow
s
side
the
visitors
at
length
wandered
back
to
the
to
see
a
portfolio
of
dick
s
but
peyton
remained
seated
behind
the
urn
listening
to
the
interchange
of
talk
through
the
open
door
while
she
tried
to
coordinate
her
impressions
she
saw
that
miss
verney
was
sincerely
interested
in
dick
s
work
it
was
the
nature
of
her
interest
that
remained
in
doubt
as
if
to
solve
this
doubt
the
girl
presently
reappeared
alone
on
the
threshold
and
discovering
peyton
advanced
toward
her
with
a
smile
are
you
tired
of
hearing
us
praise
peyton
s
things
she
asked
dropping
into
a
low
chair
beside
her
hostess
unintelligent
admiration
must
be
a
bore
to
people
who
know
and
darrow
tells
me
you
are
almost
as
learned
as
your
peyton
returned
the
smile
but
evaded
the
question
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
your
admiration
unintelligent
she
said
i
like
to
feel
that
my
boy
s
work
is
appreciated
by
people
who
understand
oh
i
have
the
usual
smattering
said
miss
verney
carelessly
i
i
know
why
i
admire
his
work
but
then
i
am
sure
i
see
more
in
it
when
some
one
like
darrow
tells
me
how
remarkable
it
does
darrow
say
that
the
mother
exclaimed
losing
sight
of
her
object
in
the
rush
of
maternal
pleasure
he
has
said
nothing
else
it
seems
to
be
the
only
subject
which
loosens
his
tongue
i
believe
he
is
more
anxious
to
have
your
son
win
the
competition
than
to
win
it
he
is
a
very
good
friend
peyton
assented
she
was
struck
by
the
way
in
which
the
girl
led
the
topic
back
to
the
special
application
of
it
which
interested
her
she
had
none
of
the
artifices
of
prudery
he
feels
sure
that
peyton
win
miss
verney
continued
it
was
very
interesting
to
hear
his
reasons
he
is
an
extraordinarily
interesting
man
it
must
be
a
tremendous
incentive
to
have
such
a
peyton
hesitated
the
friendship
is
delightful
but
i
don
t
know
that
my
son
needs
the
incentive
he
is
almost
too
miss
verney
looked
up
brightly
can
one
be
she
said
ambition
is
so
splendid
it
must
be
so
glorious
to
be
a
man
and
go
crashing
through
obstacles
straight
up
to
the
thing
one
is
after
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
care
for
people
who
are
superior
to
success
i
like
marriage
by
capture
she
rose
with
her
wandering
laugh
and
stood
flushed
and
sparkling
above
peyton
who
continued
to
gaze
at
her
gravely
what
do
you
call
success
the
latter
asked
it
means
so
many
different
oh
yes
i
know
the
inward
approval
and
all
that
well
i
m
afraid
i
like
the
other
kind
the
drums
and
wreaths
and
acclamations
if
i
were
peyton
for
instance
i
d
much
rather
win
the
competition
than
than
be
as
disinterested
as
peyton
smiled
i
hope
you
won
t
tell
him
so
she
said
half
seriously
he
is
already
and
he
is
so
easily
influenced
by
any
one
who
whose
opinion
he
she
stopped
abruptly
hearing
herself
with
a
strange
inward
shock
the
words
which
another
man
s
mother
had
once
spoken
to
her
miss
verney
did
not
seem
to
take
the
allusion
to
herself
for
she
continued
to
fix
on
peyton
a
gaze
of
impartial
sympathy
but
we
can
t
help
being
interested
she
declared
it
s
very
kind
of
you
but
i
wish
you
would
all
help
him
to
feel
that
his
competition
is
after
all
of
very
little
account
compared
with
other
things
his
health
and
his
peace
of
mind
for
instance
he
is
looking
horribly
used
the
girl
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
dick
who
was
just
reentering
the
room
at
darrow
s
side
oh
do
you
think
so
she
said
i
should
have
thought
it
was
his
friend
who
was
used
peyton
followed
the
glance
with
surprise
she
had
been
too
preoccupied
to
notice
darrow
whose
crudely
modelled
face
was
always
of
a
dull
pallour
to
which
his
grey
eye
lent
no
relief
except
in
rare
moments
of
expansion
now
the
face
had
the
fallen
lines
of
a
in
which
only
the
smile
he
turned
on
dick
remained
alive
and
the
sight
smote
her
with
compunction
poor
darrow
he
did
look
horribly
fagged
out
as
if
he
needed
care
and
petting
and
good
food
no
one
knew
exactly
how
he
lived
his
rooms
according
to
dick
s
report
were
fireless
and
ill
kept
but
he
stuck
to
them
because
his
landlady
whom
he
had
fished
out
of
some
financial
plight
had
difficulty
in
obtaining
other
lodgers
he
belonged
to
no
clubs
and
wandered
out
alone
for
his
meals
mysteriously
refusing
the
hospitality
which
his
friends
pressed
on
him
it
was
plain
that
he
was
very
poor
and
dick
conjectured
that
he
sent
what
he
earned
to
an
aunt
in
his
native
village
but
he
was
so
silent
about
such
matters
that
outside
of
his
profession
he
seemed
to
have
no
personal
life
miss
verney
s
companion
having
presently
advised
her
of
the
lapse
of
time
there
ensued
a
general
at
the
close
of
which
dick
accompanied
the
ladies
to
their
carriage
darrow
was
meanwhile
blundering
into
his
greatcoat
a
process
which
always
threw
him
into
a
state
of
perspiring
embarrassment
but
peyton
surprising
him
in
the
act
suggested
that
he
should
defer
it
and
give
her
a
few
moments
talk
let
me
make
you
some
fresh
tea
she
said
as
darrow
blushingly
shed
the
garment
and
when
dick
comes
back
we
ll
all
walk
home
together
i
ve
not
had
a
chance
to
say
two
words
to
you
this
darrow
sank
into
a
chair
at
her
side
and
nervously
contemplated
his
boots
i
ve
been
tremendously
hard
at
work
he
said
i
know
hard
at
work
i
m
afraid
dick
tells
me
you
have
been
wearing
yourself
out
over
your
competition
oh
well
i
shall
have
time
to
rest
now
he
returned
i
put
the
last
stroke
to
them
this
peyton
gave
him
a
quick
look
you
re
ahead
of
dick
in
point
of
time
only
he
said
smiling
that
is
in
itself
an
advantage
she
answered
with
a
tinge
of
asperity
in
spite
of
an
honest
effort
for
impartiality
she
could
not
at
the
moment
help
regarding
darrow
as
an
obstacle
in
her
son
s
path
i
wish
the
competition
were
over
she
exclaimed
conscious
that
her
voice
had
betrayed
her
i
hate
to
see
you
both
looking
so
darrow
smiled
again
perhaps
at
her
studied
inclusion
of
himself
oh
s
all
right
he
said
he
ll
pull
himself
together
in
no
he
spoke
with
an
emphasis
which
might
have
struck
her
if
her
sympathies
had
not
again
been
deflected
by
the
allusion
to
her
son
not
if
he
doesn
t
win
she
exclaimed
darrow
took
the
tea
she
had
poured
for
him
knocking
the
spoon
to
the
floor
in
his
eagerness
to
perform
the
feat
gracefully
in
bending
to
recover
the
spoon
he
struck
the
with
his
shoulder
and
set
the
cups
dancing
having
regained
a
measure
of
composure
he
took
a
swallow
of
the
hot
tea
and
set
it
down
with
a
gasp
precariously
near
the
edge
of
the
peyton
rescued
the
cup
and
darrow
apparently
forgetting
its
existence
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
it
was
always
hard
for
him
to
sit
still
when
he
talked
you
mean
he
s
so
tremendously
set
on
it
he
broke
out
peyton
hesitated
you
know
him
almost
as
well
as
i
do
she
said
he
s
capable
of
anything
where
there
is
a
possibility
of
success
but
i
m
always
afraid
of
the
oh
well
dick
s
a
man
said
darrow
bluntly
besides
he
s
going
to
i
wish
he
didn
t
feel
so
sure
of
it
you
mustn
t
think
i
m
afraid
for
him
he
s
a
man
and
i
want
him
to
take
his
chances
with
other
men
but
i
wish
he
didn
t
care
so
much
about
what
people
people
miss
verney
then
i
suppose
you
darrow
paused
in
front
of
her
yes
he
s
talked
a
good
deal
about
her
you
think
she
wants
him
to
succeed
at
any
price
he
drew
his
brows
together
what
do
you
call
any
price
well
herself
in
this
case
i
darrow
bent
a
puzzled
stare
on
her
you
mean
she
attached
that
amount
of
importance
to
this
competition
she
seems
to
regard
it
as
symbolical
that
s
what
i
gather
and
i
m
afraid
she
s
given
him
the
same
darrow
s
sunken
face
was
suffused
by
his
rare
smile
oh
well
he
ll
pull
it
off
then
he
said
peyton
rose
with
a
distracted
sigh
i
half
hope
he
won
t
for
such
a
motive
she
exclaimed
the
motive
won
t
show
in
his
work
said
darrow
he
added
after
a
pause
probably
devoted
to
the
search
for
the
right
word
he
seems
to
think
a
great
deal
of
peyton
fixed
him
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
knew
what
think
of
why
i
never
saw
her
no
but
you
talked
with
her
you
ve
formed
an
opinion
i
think
you
came
here
on
he
chuckled
joyously
at
her
discernment
she
had
always
seemed
to
him
gifted
with
supernatural
insight
well
i
did
want
to
see
her
he
owned
and
what
do
you
think
he
took
a
few
vague
steps
and
then
halted
before
peyton
i
think
he
said
smiling
that
she
likes
to
be
helped
first
and
to
have
everything
on
her
plate
at
iii
at
dinner
with
a
rush
of
contrition
peyton
remembered
that
she
had
after
all
not
spoken
to
darrow
about
his
health
he
had
distracted
her
by
beginning
to
talk
of
dick
and
besides
much
as
darrow
s
opinions
interested
her
his
personality
had
never
fixed
her
attention
he
always
seemed
to
her
simply
a
vehicle
for
the
transmission
of
ideas
it
was
dick
who
recalled
her
to
a
sense
of
her
omission
by
asking
if
she
hadn
t
thought
that
old
paul
looked
rather
more
ragged
than
usual
he
did
look
tired
peyton
conceded
i
meant
to
tell
him
to
take
care
of
dick
laughed
at
the
futility
of
the
measure
old
paul
is
never
tired
he
can
work
hours
out
of
the
the
trouble
with
him
is
that
he
s
something
wrong
with
the
machinery
i
m
oh
i
m
sorry
has
he
seen
a
doctor
he
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
when
i
suggested
it
the
other
day
but
he
s
so
deuced
mysterious
that
i
don
t
know
what
he
may
have
done
dick
rose
putting
down
his
and
cigarette
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
pop
in
on
him
and
see
how
he
s
getting
but
he
lives
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
and
you
re
tired
i
m
not
tired
only
a
little
he
returned
smiling
and
besides
i
m
going
to
meet
gill
at
the
office
by
and
by
and
put
in
a
night
s
work
it
won
t
hurt
me
to
take
a
look
at
paul
peyton
was
silent
she
knew
it
was
useless
to
contend
with
her
son
about
his
work
and
she
tried
to
fortify
herself
with
the
remembrance
of
her
own
words
to
darrow
dick
was
a
man
and
must
take
his
chance
with
other
men
but
dick
glancing
at
his
watch
uttered
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
oh
by
jove
i
shan
t
have
time
after
all
gill
is
waiting
for
me
now
we
must
have
dawdled
over
he
went
to
give
his
mother
a
caressing
tap
on
the
cheek
now
don
t
worry
he
adjured
her
and
as
she
smiled
back
at
him
he
added
with
a
sudden
happy
blush
she
doesn
t
you
know
she
s
so
sure
of
peyton
s
smile
faded
and
laying
a
detaining
hand
on
his
she
said
with
sudden
directness
sure
of
you
or
of
your
success
he
hesitated
oh
she
regards
them
as
synonymous
she
thinks
i
m
bound
to
get
but
if
you
don
t
he
shrugged
laughingly
but
with
a
slight
contraction
of
his
confident
brows
why
i
shall
have
to
make
way
for
some
one
else
i
suppose
that
s
the
law
of
peyton
sat
upright
gazing
at
him
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
is
it
the
law
of
love
she
asked
he
looked
down
on
her
with
a
smile
that
trembled
a
little
my
dear
romantic
mother
i
don
t
want
her
pity
you
know
dick
coming
home
the
next
morning
shortly
before
daylight
left
the
house
again
after
a
hurried
breakfast
and
peyton
heard
nothing
of
him
till
nightfall
he
had
promised
to
be
back
for
dinner
but
a
few
moments
before
eight
as
she
was
coming
down
to
the
the
handed
her
a
hastily
pencilled
note
don
t
wait
for
me
it
ran
darrow
is
ill
and
i
can
t
leave
him
i
ll
send
a
line
when
the
doctor
has
seen
peyton
who
was
a
woman
of
rapid
reactions
read
the
words
with
a
pang
she
was
ashamed
of
the
jealous
thoughts
she
had
harboured
of
darrow
and
of
the
selfishness
which
had
made
her
lose
sight
of
his
troubles
in
the
consideration
of
dick
s
welfare
even
clemence
verney
whom
she
secretly
accused
of
a
want
of
heart
had
been
struck
by
darrow
s
ill
looks
while
she
had
had
eyes
only
for
her
son
poor
darrow
how
cold
and
he
must
have
thought
her
in
the
first
rush
of
penitence
her
impulse
was
to
drive
at
once
to
his
lodgings
but
the
infection
of
his
own
shyness
restrained
her
dick
s
note
gave
no
details
the
illness
was
evidently
grave
but
might
not
darrow
regard
her
coming
as
an
intrusion
to
repair
her
negligence
of
yesterday
by
a
sudden
invasion
of
his
privacy
might
be
only
a
greater
failure
in
tact
and
after
a
moment
of
deliberation
she
resolved
on
sending
to
ask
dick
if
he
wished
her
to
go
to
him
the
reply
which
came
late
was
what
she
had
expected
no
we
have
all
the
help
we
need
the
doctor
has
sent
a
good
nurse
and
is
coming
again
later
it
s
pneumonia
but
of
course
he
doesn
t
say
much
yet
let
me
have
some
as
soon
as
the
cook
can
make
the
ordered
and
dispatched
she
was
left
to
a
vigil
in
melancholy
contrast
to
that
of
the
previous
evening
then
she
had
been
enclosed
in
the
narrow
limits
of
her
maternal
interests
now
the
barriers
of
self
were
broken
down
and
her
personal
preoccupations
swept
away
on
the
current
of
a
wider
sympathy
as
she
sat
there
in
the
radius
of
which
for
so
many
evenings
had
held
dick
and
herself
in
a
charmed
circle
of
tenderness
she
saw
that
her
love
for
her
boy
had
come
to
be
merely
a
kind
of
extended
egotism
love
had
narrowed
instead
of
widening
her
had
rebuilt
between
herself
and
life
the
very
walls
which
years
and
years
before
she
had
laid
low
with
bleeding
fingers
it
was
horrible
how
she
had
come
to
sacrifice
everything
to
the
one
passion
of
ambition
for
her
boy
at
daylight
she
sent
another
messenger
one
of
her
own
servants
who
returned
without
having
seen
dick
peyton
had
sent
word
that
there
was
no
change
he
would
write
later
he
wanted
nothing
the
day
wore
on
drearily
once
kate
found
herself
computing
the
precious
hours
lost
to
dick
s
unfinished
task
she
blushed
at
her
ineradicable
selfishness
and
tried
to
turn
her
mind
to
poor
darrow
but
she
could
not
master
her
impulses
and
now
she
caught
herself
indulging
the
thought
that
his
illness
would
at
least
exclude
him
from
the
competition
but
no
she
remembered
that
he
had
said
his
work
was
finished
come
what
might
he
stood
in
the
path
of
her
boy
s
success
she
hated
herself
for
the
thought
but
it
would
not
down
evening
drew
on
but
there
was
no
note
from
dick
at
length
in
the
shamed
reaction
from
her
fears
she
rang
for
a
carriage
and
went
upstairs
to
dress
she
could
stand
aloof
no
longer
she
must
go
to
darrow
if
only
to
escape
from
her
wicked
thoughts
of
him
as
she
came
down
again
she
heard
dick
s
key
in
the
door
she
hastened
her
steps
and
as
she
reached
the
hall
he
stood
before
her
without
speaking
she
looked
at
him
and
the
question
died
on
her
lips
he
nodded
and
walked
slowly
past
her
there
was
no
hope
from
the
first
he
said
the
next
day
dick
was
taken
up
with
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
the
distant
aunt
who
appeared
to
be
darrow
s
only
relation
had
been
duly
notified
of
his
death
but
no
answer
having
been
received
from
her
it
was
left
to
his
friend
to
fulfil
the
customary
duties
he
was
again
absent
for
the
best
part
of
the
day
and
when
he
returned
at
dusk
peyton
looking
up
from
the
behind
which
she
awaited
him
was
startled
by
the
misery
of
his
face
her
own
thoughts
were
too
painful
for
ready
expression
and
they
sat
for
a
while
in
a
mute
community
of
wretchedness
is
everything
arranged
she
asked
at
length
yes
and
you
have
not
heard
from
the
aunt
he
shook
his
head
can
you
find
no
trace
of
any
other
relations
none
i
went
over
all
his
papers
there
were
very
few
and
i
found
no
address
but
the
aunt
he
sat
thrown
back
in
his
chair
disregarding
the
cup
of
tea
she
had
mechanically
poured
for
him
i
found
this
though
he
added
after
a
pause
drawing
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
holding
it
out
to
her
she
took
it
doubtfully
ought
i
to
read
it
she
saw
then
that
the
envelope
in
darrow
s
hand
was
addressed
to
her
son
within
were
a
few
pencilled
words
dated
on
the
first
day
of
his
illness
the
morrow
of
the
day
on
which
she
had
last
seen
him
dear
dick
she
read
i
want
you
to
use
my
plans
for
the
museum
if
you
can
get
any
good
out
of
them
even
if
i
pull
out
of
this
i
want
you
to
i
shall
have
other
chances
and
i
have
an
idea
this
one
means
a
lot
to
peyton
sat
speechless
gazing
at
the
date
of
the
letter
which
she
had
instantly
connected
with
her
last
talk
with
darrow
she
saw
that
he
had
understood
her
and
the
thought
scorched
her
to
the
soul
wasn
t
it
glorious
of
him
dick
said
she
dropped
the
letter
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
iv
the
funeral
took
place
the
next
morning
and
on
the
return
from
the
cemetery
dick
told
his
mother
that
he
must
go
and
look
over
things
at
darrow
s
office
he
had
heard
the
day
before
from
his
friend
s
aunt
a
helpless
person
to
whom
telegraphy
was
difficult
and
travel
inconceivable
and
who
in
eight
pages
of
unpunctuated
eloquence
made
over
to
dick
what
she
called
the
melancholy
privilege
of
winding
up
her
nephew
s
affairs
peyton
looked
anxiously
at
her
son
is
there
no
one
who
can
do
this
for
you
he
must
have
had
a
clerk
or
some
one
who
knows
about
his
dick
shook
his
head
not
lately
he
hasn
t
had
much
to
do
this
winter
and
these
last
months
he
had
chucked
everything
to
work
alone
over
his
the
word
brought
a
faint
colour
to
peyton
s
cheek
it
was
the
first
allusion
that
either
of
them
had
made
to
darrow
s
bequest
oh
of
course
you
must
do
all
you
can
she
murmured
turning
alone
into
the
house
the
emotions
of
the
morning
had
stirred
her
deeply
and
she
sat
at
home
during
the
day
letting
her
mind
dwell
in
a
kind
of
retrospective
piety
on
the
thought
of
poor
darrow
s
devotion
she
had
given
him
too
little
time
while
he
lived
had
acquiesced
too
easily
in
his
growing
habits
of
seclusion
and
she
felt
it
as
a
proof
of
insensibility
that
she
had
not
been
more
closely
drawn
to
the
one
person
who
had
loved
dick
as
she
loved
him
the
evidence
of
that
love
as
shown
in
darrow
s
letter
filled
her
with
a
vain
compunction
the
very
extravagance
of
his
offer
lent
it
a
deeper
pathos
it
was
wonderful
that
even
in
the
urgency
of
affection
a
man
of
his
almost
morbid
rectitude
should
have
overlooked
the
restrictions
of
professional
honour
should
have
implied
the
possibility
of
his
friend
s
overlooking
them
it
seemed
to
make
his
sacrifice
the
more
complete
that
it
had
unconsciously
taken
the
form
of
a
subtle
temptation
the
last
word
arrested
peyton
s
thoughts
a
temptation
to
whom
not
surely
to
one
capable
as
her
son
was
capable
of
rising
to
the
height
of
his
friend
s
devotion
the
offer
to
dick
would
mean
simply
as
it
meant
to
her
the
last
touching
expression
of
an
inarticulate
fidelity
the
utterance
of
a
love
which
at
last
had
found
its
formula
peyton
dismissed
as
morbid
any
other
view
of
the
case
she
was
annoyed
with
herself
for
supposing
that
dick
could
be
ever
so
remotely
affected
by
the
possibility
at
which
poor
darrow
s
renunciation
hinted
the
nature
of
the
offer
removed
it
from
practical
issues
to
the
idealizing
region
of
sentiment
peyton
had
been
sitting
alone
with
these
thoughts
for
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
and
dusk
was
falling
when
dick
entered
the
in
the
dim
light
with
his
pallour
heightened
by
the
sombre
effect
of
his
mourning
he
came
upon
her
almost
startlingly
with
a
revival
of
some
impression
which
for
a
moment
gave
her
the
sense
of
struggling
among
shadows
she
did
not
at
first
know
what
had
produced
the
effect
then
she
saw
that
it
was
his
likeness
to
his
father
well
is
it
over
she
asked
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
without
speaking
yes
i
ve
looked
through
he
leaned
back
crossing
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
gazing
past
her
with
a
look
of
utter
lassitude
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
tentatively
you
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
your
oh
my
work
he
exclaimed
as
if
to
brush
aside
an
pleasantry
are
you
too
tired
he
rose
and
began
to
wander
up
and
down
the
room
i
m
not
give
me
some
tea
will
you
he
paused
before
her
while
she
poured
the
cup
and
then
without
taking
it
turned
away
to
light
a
cigarette
surely
there
is
still
time
she
suggested
with
her
eyes
on
him
time
to
finish
my
plans
oh
yes
there
s
time
but
they
re
not
worth
not
worth
it
she
started
up
and
then
dropped
back
into
her
seat
ashamed
of
having
betrayed
her
anxiety
they
are
worth
as
much
as
they
were
last
week
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
not
to
me
he
returned
i
hadn
t
seen
darrow
s
there
was
a
long
silence
peyton
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
clasped
hands
and
her
son
paced
the
room
restlessly
are
they
so
wonderful
she
asked
at
length
she
paused
again
and
then
said
lifting
a
tremulous
glance
to
his
face
that
makes
his
offer
all
the
more
dick
was
lighting
another
cigarette
and
his
face
was
turned
from
her
yes
i
suppose
so
he
said
in
a
low
tone
they
were
quite
finished
he
told
me
she
continued
unconsciously
dropping
her
voice
to
the
pitch
of
his
then
they
will
be
entered
i
suppose
of
course
why
not
he
answered
almost
sharply
shall
you
have
time
to
attend
to
all
that
and
to
finish
yours
too
oh
i
suppose
so
i
ve
told
you
it
isn
t
a
question
of
tune
i
see
now
that
mine
are
not
worth
bothering
she
rose
and
approached
him
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
you
are
tired
and
unstrung
how
can
you
judge
why
not
let
me
look
at
both
designs
under
her
gaze
he
flushed
abruptly
and
drew
back
with
a
gesture
oh
i
m
afraid
that
wouldn
t
help
me
you
d
be
sure
to
think
mine
best
he
said
with
a
laugh
but
if
i
could
give
you
good
reasons
she
pressed
him
he
took
her
hand
as
if
ashamed
of
his
impatience
dear
mother
if
you
had
any
reasons
their
mere
existence
would
prove
that
they
were
his
mother
did
not
return
his
smile
you
won
t
let
me
see
the
two
designs
then
she
said
with
a
faint
tinge
of
insistence
oh
of
course
if
you
want
to
if
you
only
won
t
talk
about
it
now
can
t
you
see
that
i
m
pretty
nearly
he
burst
out
uncontrollably
and
as
she
stood
silent
he
added
with
a
weary
fall
in
his
voice
i
think
i
ll
go
upstairs
and
see
if
i
can
t
get
a
nap
before
though
they
had
separated
upon
the
assurance
that
she
should
see
the
two
designs
if
she
wished
it
peyton
knew
they
would
not
be
shown
to
her
dick
indeed
would
not
again
deny
her
request
but
had
he
not
reckoned
on
the
improbability
of
her
renewing
it
all
night
she
lay
confronted
by
that
question
the
situation
shaped
itself
before
her
with
that
hallucinating
distinctness
which
belongs
to
the
midnight
vision
she
knew
now
why
dick
had
suddenly
reminded
her
of
his
father
had
she
not
once
before
seen
the
same
thought
moving
behind
the
same
eyes
she
was
sure
it
had
occurred
to
dick
to
use
darrow
s
drawings
as
she
lay
awake
in
the
darkness
she
could
hear
him
long
after
midnight
pacing
the
floor
overhead
she
held
her
breath
listening
to
the
recurring
beat
of
his
foot
which
seemed
that
of
an
imprisoned
spirit
revolving
wearily
in
the
cage
of
the
same
thought
she
felt
in
every
fibre
that
a
crisis
in
her
son
s
life
had
been
reached
that
the
act
now
before
him
would
have
a
determining
effect
on
his
whole
future
the
circumstances
of
her
past
had
raised
to
clairvoyance
her
natural
insight
into
human
motive
had
made
of
her
a
moral
barometer
responding
to
the
faintest
fluctuations
of
atmosphere
and
years
of
anxious
meditation
had
familiarized
her
with
the
form
which
her
son
s
temptations
were
likely
to
take
the
peculiar
misery
of
her
situation
was
that
she
could
not
except
indirectly
put
this
intuition
this
foresight
at
his
service
it
was
a
part
of
her
discernment
to
be
aware
that
life
is
the
only
real
counsellor
that
wisdom
unfiltered
through
personal
experience
does
not
become
a
part
of
the
moral
tissues
love
such
as
hers
had
a
great
office
the
office
of
preparation
and
direction
but
it
must
know
how
to
hold
its
hand
and
keep
its
counsel
how
to
attend
upon
its
object
as
an
invisible
influence
rather
than
as
an
active
interference
all
this
kate
peyton
had
told
herself
again
and
again
during
those
hours
of
anxious
calculation
in
which
she
had
tried
to
cast
dick
s
horoscope
but
not
in
her
moments
of
most
fantastic
foreboding
had
she
figured
so
cruel
a
test
of
her
courage
if
her
prayers
for
him
had
taken
precise
shape
she
might
have
asked
that
he
should
be
spared
the
spectacular
the
dramatic
appeal
to
his
that
his
temptations
should
slip
by
him
in
a
dull
disguise
she
had
secured
him
against
all
ordinary
forms
of
baseness
the
vulnerable
point
lay
higher
in
that
region
of
idealizing
egotism
which
is
the
seat
of
life
in
such
natures
years
of
solitary
foresight
gave
her
mind
a
singular
alertness
in
dealing
with
such
possibilities
she
saw
at
once
that
the
peril
of
the
situation
lay
in
the
minimum
of
risk
it
involved
darrow
had
employed
no
assistant
in
working
out
his
plans
for
the
competition
and
his
secluded
life
made
it
almost
certain
that
he
had
not
shown
them
to
any
one
and
that
she
and
dick
alone
knew
them
to
have
been
completed
moreover
it
was
a
part
of
dick
s
duty
to
examine
the
contents
of
his
friend
s
office
and
in
doing
this
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
possess
himself
of
the
drawings
and
make
use
of
any
part
of
them
that
might
serve
his
purpose
he
had
darrow
s
authority
for
doing
so
and
though
the
act
involved
a
slight
breach
of
professional
probity
might
not
his
friend
s
wishes
be
invoked
as
a
secret
justification
peyton
found
herself
almost
hating
poor
darrow
for
having
been
the
unconscious
instrument
of
her
son
s
temptation
but
what
right
had
she
after
all
to
suspect
dick
of
considering
even
for
a
moment
the
act
of
which
she
was
so
ready
to
accuse
him
his
unwillingness
to
let
her
see
the
drawings
might
have
been
the
accidental
result
of
lassitude
and
discouragement
he
was
tired
and
troubled
and
she
had
chosen
the
wrong
moment
to
make
the
request
his
want
of
readiness
might
even
be
due
to
the
wish
to
conceal
from
her
how
far
his
friend
had
surpassed
him
she
knew
his
sensitiveness
on
this
point
and
reproached
herself
for
not
having
foreseen
it
but
her
own
arguments
failed
to
convince
her
deep
beneath
her
love
for
her
boy
and
her
faith
in
him
there
lurked
a
nameless
doubt
she
could
hardly
now
in
looking
back
define
the
impulse
upon
which
she
had
married
denis
peyton
she
knew
only
that
the
deeps
of
her
nature
had
been
loosened
and
that
she
had
been
borne
forward
on
their
current
to
the
very
fate
from
which
her
heart
recoiled
but
if
in
one
sense
her
marriage
remained
a
problem
there
was
another
in
which
her
motherhood
seemed
to
solve
it
she
had
never
lost
the
sense
of
having
snatched
her
child
from
some
dim
peril
which
still
lurked
and
hovered
and
he
became
more
closely
hers
with
every
effort
of
her
vigilant
love
for
the
act
of
rescue
had
not
been
accomplished
once
and
for
all
in
the
moment
of
immolation
it
had
not
been
by
a
sudden
stroke
of
heroism
but
by
and
indefatigable
effort
that
she
had
built
up
for
him
the
miraculous
shelter
of
her
love
and
now
that
it
stood
there
a
hallowed
refuge
against
failure
she
could
not
even
set
a
light
in
the
pane
but
must
let
him
grope
his
way
to
it
unaided
v
peyton
s
midnight
musings
summed
themselves
up
in
the
conclusion
that
the
next
few
hours
would
end
her
uncertainty
she
felt
the
day
to
be
decisive
if
dick
offered
to
show
her
the
drawings
her
fears
would
be
proved
groundless
if
he
avoided
the
subject
they
were
justified
she
dressed
early
in
order
not
to
miss
him
at
breakfast
but
as
she
entered
the
the
told
her
that
peyton
had
overslept
himself
and
had
rung
to
have
his
breakfast
sent
upstairs
was
it
a
pretext
to
avoid
her
she
was
vexed
at
her
own
readiness
to
see
a
portent
in
the
simplest
incident
but
while
she
blushed
at
her
doubts
she
let
them
govern
her
she
left
the
door
open
determined
not
to
miss
him
if
he
came
downstairs
while
she
was
at
breakfast
then
she
went
back
to
the
and
sat
down
at
her
trying
to
busy
herself
with
some
accounts
while
she
listened
for
his
step
here
too
she
had
left
the
door
open
but
presently
even
this
slight
departure
from
her
daily
usage
seemed
a
deviation
from
the
passive
attitude
she
had
adopted
and
she
rose
and
shut
the
door
she
knew
that
she
could
still
hear
his
step
on
the
stairs
he
had
his
father
s
quick
swinging
gait
but
as
she
sat
listening
and
vainly
trying
to
write
the
closed
door
seemed
to
symbolize
a
refusal
to
share
in
his
trial
a
hardening
of
herself
against
his
need
of
her
what
if
he
should
come
down
intending
to
speak
and
should
be
turned
from
his
purpose
slighter
obstacles
have
deflected
the
course
of
events
in
those
indeterminate
moments
when
the
soul
floats
between
two
tides
she
sprang
up
quickly
and
as
her
hand
touched
the
latch
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stairs
when
he
entered
the
she
had
regained
the
and
could
lift
a
composed
face
to
his
he
came
in
hurriedly
yet
with
a
kind
of
reluctance
beneath
his
haste
again
it
was
his
father
s
step
she
smiled
but
looked
away
from
him
as
he
approached
her
she
seemed
to
be
her
own
past
as
one
things
in
the
distortion
of
fever
are
you
off
already
she
asked
glancing
at
the
hat
in
his
hand
yes
i
m
late
as
it
is
i
overslept
he
paused
and
looked
vaguely
about
the
room
don
t
expect
me
till
late
don
t
wait
dinner
for
she
stirred
impulsively
dick
you
re
overworking
you
ll
make
yourself
nonsense
i
m
as
fit
as
ever
this
morning
don
t
be
imagining
he
dropped
his
habitual
kiss
on
her
forehead
and
turned
to
go
on
the
threshold
he
paused
and
she
felt
that
something
in
him
sought
her
and
then
drew
back
he
called
to
her
as
the
door
closed
on
him
she
sat
down
and
tried
to
survey
the
situation
divested
of
her
midnight
fears
he
had
not
referred
to
her
wish
to
see
the
drawings
but
what
did
the
omission
signify
might
he
not
have
forgotten
her
request
was
she
not
forcing
the
most
trivial
details
to
fit
in
with
her
apprehensions
unfortunately
for
her
own
reassurance
she
knew
that
her
familiarity
with
dick
s
processes
was
based
on
such
minute
observation
and
that
to
such
intimacy
as
theirs
no
indications
were
trivial
she
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
when
he
had
left
the
house
that
morning
he
was
weighing
the
possibility
of
using
darrow
s
drawings
of
supplementing
his
own
incomplete
design
from
the
fulness
of
his
friend
s
invention
and
with
a
bitter
pang
she
divined
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
shown
her
darrow
s
letter
it
was
impossible
to
remain
face
to
face
with
such
conjectures
and
though
she
had
given
up
all
her
engagements
during
the
few
days
since
darrow
s
death
she
now
took
refuge
in
the
thought
of
a
concert
which
was
to
take
place
at
a
friend
s
house
that
morning
the
when
she
entered
was
thronged
with
acquaintances
and
she
found
transient
relief
in
that
dispersal
of
attention
which
makes
society
an
anesthetic
for
some
forms
of
wretchedness
contact
with
the
pressure
of
busy
indifferent
life
often
gives
remoteness
to
questions
which
have
clung
as
close
as
the
flesh
to
the
bone
and
if
peyton
did
not
find
such
complete
release
she
at
least
interposed
between
herself
and
her
anxiety
the
obligation
to
dissemble
it
but
the
relief
was
only
momentary
and
when
the
first
bars
of
the
overture
turned
from
her
the
smiles
of
recognition
among
which
she
had
tried
to
lose
herself
she
felt
a
deeper
sense
of
isolation
the
music
which
at
another
time
would
have
swept
her
away
on
some
rich
current
of
emotion
now
seemed
to
island
her
in
her
own
thoughts
to
create
an
artificial
solitude
in
which
she
found
herself
more
immitigably
face
to
face
with
her
fears
the
silence
the
about
her
gave
resonance
to
the
inner
voices
lucidity
to
the
inner
vision
till
she
seemed
enclosed
in
a
luminous
empty
horizon
against
which
every
possibility
took
the
sharp
edge
of
accomplished
fact
with
relentless
precision
the
course
of
events
was
unrolled
before
her
she
saw
dick
yielding
to
his
opportunity
snatching
victory
from
dishonour
winning
love
happiness
and
success
in
the
act
by
which
he
lost
himself
it
was
all
so
simple
so
easy
so
inevitable
that
she
felt
the
futility
of
struggling
or
hoping
against
it
he
would
win
the
competition
would
marry
miss
verney
would
press
on
to
achievement
through
the
opening
which
the
first
success
had
made
for
him
as
peyton
reached
this
point
in
her
forecast
she
found
her
outward
gaze
arrested
by
the
face
of
the
young
lady
who
so
dominated
her
inner
vision
miss
verney
a
few
rows
distant
sat
intent
upon
the
music
in
that
attitude
of
poised
motion
which
was
her
nearest
approach
to
repose
her
slender
brown
profile
with
its
breezy
hair
her
quick
eye
and
the
lips
which
seemed
to
listen
as
well
as
speak
all
betokened
to
peyton
a
nature
through
which
the
obvious
energies
blew
free
a
bare
open
stretch
of
consciousness
without
shelter
for
tenderer
growths
she
shivered
to
think
of
dick
s
frail
scruples
exposed
to
those
rustling
airs
and
then
suddenly
a
new
thought
struck
her
what
if
she
might
turn
this
force
to
her
own
use
make
it
serve
unconsciously
to
dick
as
the
means
of
his
deliverance
hitherto
she
had
assumed
that
her
son
s
worst
danger
lay
in
the
chance
of
his
confiding
his
difficulty
to
clemence
verney
and
she
had
in
her
own
past
a
precedent
which
made
her
think
such
a
confidence
not
unlikely
if
he
did
carry
his
scruples
to
the
girl
she
argued
the
latter
s
imperviousness
her
frank
inability
to
understand
them
would
have
the
effect
of
dispelling
them
like
mist
and
he
was
acute
enough
to
know
this
and
profit
by
it
so
she
had
hitherto
reasoned
but
now
the
girl
s
presence
seemed
to
clarify
her
perceptions
and
she
told
herself
that
something
in
dick
s
nature
something
which
she
herself
had
put
there
would
resist
this
short
cut
to
safety
would
make
him
take
the
more
tortuous
way
to
his
goal
rather
than
gain
it
through
the
privacies
of
the
heart
he
loved
for
she
had
lifted
him
thus
far
above
his
father
that
it
would
be
a
disenchantment
to
him
to
find
that
clemence
verney
did
not
share
his
scruples
on
this
much
his
mother
now
exultingly
felt
she
could
count
in
her
passive
struggle
for
supremacy
no
he
would
never
never
tell
clemence
verney
and
his
one
hope
his
sure
salvation
therefore
lay
in
some
one
else
s
telling
her
the
excitement
of
this
discovery
had
nearly
in
swept
peyton
from
her
seat
to
the
girl
s
side
fearing
to
miss
the
latter
in
the
throng
at
the
entrance
she
slipped
out
during
the
last
number
and
lingering
in
the
farther
let
the
dispersing
audience
drift
her
in
miss
verney
s
direction
the
girl
shone
sympathetically
on
her
approach
and
in
a
moment
they
had
detached
themselves
from
the
crowd
and
taken
refuge
in
the
perfumed
emptiness
of
the
conservatory
the
girl
whose
sensations
were
always
easily
set
in
motion
had
at
first
a
good
deal
to
say
of
the
music
for
which
she
claimed
on
her
hearer
s
part
an
active
show
of
approval
or
dissent
but
this
dismissed
she
turned
a
melting
face
on
peyton
and
said
with
one
of
her
rapid
modulations
of
tone
i
was
so
sorry
about
poor
peyton
uttered
an
assenting
sigh
it
was
a
great
grief
to
us
a
great
loss
to
my
yes
i
know
i
can
imagine
what
you
must
have
felt
and
then
it
was
so
unlucky
that
it
should
have
happened
just
peyton
shot
a
reconnoitring
glance
at
her
profile
his
dying
you
mean
on
the
eve
of
success
miss
verney
turned
a
frank
smile
upon
her
one
ought
to
feel
that
of
course
but
i
m
afraid
i
am
very
selfish
where
my
friends
are
concerned
and
i
was
thinking
of
peyton
s
having
to
give
up
his
work
at
such
a
critical
she
spoke
without
a
note
of
deprecation
there
was
a
pagan
freshness
in
her
opportunism
peyton
was
silent
and
the
girl
continued
after
a
pause
i
suppose
now
it
will
be
almost
impossible
for
him
to
finish
his
drawings
in
time
it
s
a
pity
he
hadn
t
worked
out
the
whole
scheme
a
little
sooner
then
the
details
would
have
come
of
peyton
felt
a
contempt
strangely
mingled
with
exultation
if
only
the
girl
would
talk
in
that
way
to
dick
he
has
hardly
had
time
to
think
of
himself
lately
she
said
trying
to
keep
the
coldness
out
of
her
voice
no
of
course
not
miss
verney
assented
but
isn
t
that
all
the
more
reason
for
his
friends
to
think
of
him
it
was
very
dear
of
him
to
give
up
everything
to
nurse
darrow
but
after
all
if
a
man
is
going
to
get
on
in
his
career
there
are
times
when
he
must
think
first
of
peyton
paused
trying
to
choose
her
words
with
deliberation
it
was
quite
clear
now
that
dick
had
not
spoken
and
she
felt
the
responsibility
that
devolved
upon
her
getting
on
in
a
career
is
that
always
the
first
thing
to
be
considered
she
asked
letting
her
eyes
rest
musingly
on
the
girl
s
the
glance
did
not
disconcert
miss
verney
who
returned
it
with
one
of
equal
comprehensiveness
yes
she
said
quickly
and
with
a
slight
blush
with
a
temperament
like
peyton
s
i
believe
it
is
some
people
can
pick
themselves
up
after
any
number
of
bad
falls
i
am
not
sure
that
he
could
i
think
discouragement
would
weaken
instead
of
strengthening
both
women
had
forgotten
external
conditions
in
the
quick
reach
for
each
other
s
meanings
peyton
flushed
her
maternal
pride
in
revolt
but
the
answer
was
checked
on
her
lips
by
the
sense
of
the
girl
s
unexpected
insight
here
was
some
one
who
knew
dick
as
well
as
she
did
should
she
say
a
partisan
or
an
accomplice
a
dim
jealousy
stirred
beneath
peyton
s
other
emotions
she
was
undergoing
the
agony
which
the
mother
feels
at
the
first
intrusion
on
her
privilege
of
judging
her
child
and
her
voice
had
a
flutter
of
resentment
you
must
have
a
poor
opinion
of
his
character
she
said
miss
verney
did
not
remove
her
eyes
but
her
blush
deepened
beautifully
i
have
at
any
rate
she
said
a
high
one
of
his
talent
i
don
t
suppose
many
men
have
an
equal
amount
of
moral
and
intellectual
and
you
would
cultivate
the
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
in
certain
cases
and
up
to
a
certain
she
shook
out
the
long
fur
of
her
muff
one
of
those
silvery
flexible
furs
which
clothe
a
woman
with
a
delicate
sumptuousness
everything
about
her
at
the
moment
seemed
rich
and
cold
everything
as
peyton
quickly
noted
but
the
blush
lingering
under
her
dark
skin
and
so
complete
was
the
girl
s
that
the
blush
seemed
to
be
there
only
because
it
had
been
forgotten
i
dare
say
you
think
me
strange
she
continued
most
people
do
because
i
speak
the
truth
it
s
the
easiest
way
of
concealing
one
s
feelings
i
can
for
instance
talk
quite
openly
about
peyton
under
shelter
of
your
inference
that
i
shouldn
t
do
so
if
i
were
what
is
called
interested
in
him
and
as
i
interested
in
him
my
method
has
its
advantages
she
ended
with
one
of
the
fluttering
laughs
which
seemed
to
flit
from
point
to
point
of
her
expressive
person
peyton
leaned
toward
her
i
believe
you
are
interested
she
said
quietly
and
since
i
suppose
you
allow
others
the
privilege
you
claim
for
yourself
i
am
going
to
confess
that
i
followed
you
here
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
the
nature
of
your
miss
verney
shot
a
glance
at
her
and
drew
away
in
a
soft
subsidence
of
undulating
furs
is
this
an
embassy
she
asked
smiling
no
not
in
any
the
girl
leaned
back
with
an
air
of
relief
i
m
glad
i
should
have
disliked
she
looked
again
at
peyton
you
want
to
know
what
i
mean
to
do
then
i
can
only
answer
that
i
mean
to
wait
and
see
what
he
you
mean
that
everything
is
contingent
on
his
success
am
if
i
m
everything
she
admitted
gaily
the
mother
s
heart
was
beating
in
her
throat
and
her
words
seemed
to
force
themselves
out
through
the
throbs
i
i
don
t
quite
see
why
you
attach
such
importance
to
this
special
because
he
does
the
girl
returned
instantly
because
to
him
it
is
the
final
answer
to
his
the
questioning
whether
he
is
ever
to
amount
to
anything
or
not
he
says
if
he
has
anything
in
him
it
ought
to
come
out
now
all
the
conditions
are
favourable
it
is
the
chance
he
has
always
prayed
for
you
see
she
continued
almost
confidentially
but
without
the
least
loss
of
composure
you
see
he
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
himself
and
his
various
experiments
his
phrases
of
indecision
and
disgust
there
are
lots
of
tentative
talents
in
the
world
and
the
sooner
they
are
crushed
out
by
circumstances
the
better
but
it
seems
as
though
he
really
had
it
in
him
to
do
something
distinguished
as
though
the
uncertainty
lay
in
his
character
and
not
in
his
talent
that
is
what
interests
what
attracts
me
one
can
t
teach
a
man
to
have
genius
but
if
he
has
it
one
may
show
him
how
to
use
it
that
is
what
i
should
be
good
for
you
see
to
keep
him
up
to
his
peyton
had
listened
with
an
intensity
of
attention
that
left
her
reply
unprepared
there
was
something
startling
and
yet
half
attractive
in
the
girl
s
avowal
of
principles
which
are
oftener
lived
by
than
professed
and
you
think
she
began
at
length
that
in
this
case
he
has
fallen
below
his
opportunity
no
one
can
tell
of
course
but
his
discouragement
his
is
a
bad
sign
i
don
t
think
he
has
any
hope
of
the
mother
again
wavered
a
moment
since
you
are
so
frank
she
then
said
will
you
let
me
be
equally
so
and
ask
how
lately
you
have
seen
him
the
girl
smiled
at
the
circumlocution
yesterday
afternoon
she
said
simply
and
you
thought
him
horribly
down
on
his
luck
he
said
himself
that
his
brain
was
again
peyton
felt
the
throb
in
her
throat
and
a
slow
blush
rose
to
her
cheek
was
that
all
he
said
about
himself
was
there
anything
else
said
the
girl
quickly
he
didn
t
tell
you
of
of
an
opportunity
to
make
up
for
the
time
he
has
lost
an
opportunity
i
don
t
he
didn
t
speak
to
you
then
of
darrow
s
letter
he
said
nothing
of
any
there
one
which
was
found
after
poor
darrow
s
death
in
it
he
gave
dick
leave
to
use
his
design
for
the
competition
dick
says
the
design
is
wonderful
it
would
give
him
just
what
he
miss
verney
sat
listening
raptly
with
a
rush
of
colour
that
suffused
her
like
light
but
when
was
this
where
was
the
letter
found
he
never
said
a
word
of
it
she
exclaimed
the
letter
was
found
on
the
day
of
darrow
s
but
i
don
t
understand
why
has
he
never
told
me
why
should
he
seem
so
hopeless
she
turned
an
ignorant
appealing
face
on
peyton
it
was
prodigious
but
it
was
true
she
felt
nothing
saw
nothing
but
the
crude
fact
of
the
opportunity
peyton
s
voice
trembled
with
the
completeness
of
her
triumph
i
suppose
his
reason
for
not
speaking
is
that
he
has
scruples
he
feels
that
to
use
the
design
would
be
miss
verney
s
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
her
in
a
commiserating
stare
dishonest
when
the
poor
man
wished
it
himself
when
it
was
his
last
request
when
the
letter
is
there
to
prove
it
why
the
design
belongs
to
your
son
no
one
else
had
any
right
to
but
dick
s
right
does
not
extend
to
passing
it
off
as
his
own
at
least
that
is
his
feeling
i
believe
if
he
won
the
competition
he
would
be
winning
it
on
false
why
should
you
call
them
false
pretenses
his
design
might
have
been
better
than
darrow
s
if
he
had
had
time
to
carry
it
out
it
seems
to
me
that
darrow
must
have
felt
this
must
have
felt
that
he
owed
his
friend
some
compensation
for
the
time
he
took
from
him
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
natural
than
his
wishing
to
make
this
return
for
your
son
s
she
positively
glowed
with
the
force
of
her
conviction
and
peyton
for
a
strange
instant
felt
her
own
resistance
wavering
she
herself
had
never
considered
the
question
in
that
light
the
light
of
darrow
s
viewing
his
gift
as
a
justifiable
compensation
but
the
glimpse
she
caught
of
it
drove
her
shuddering
behind
her
retrenchments
that
argument
she
said
coldly
would
naturally
be
more
convincing
to
darrow
than
to
my
miss
verney
glanced
up
struck
by
the
change
in
peyton
s
voice
ah
then
you
agree
with
him
you
think
it
be
dishonest
peyton
saw
that
she
had
slipped
into
my
son
and
i
have
not
spoken
of
the
matter
she
said
evasively
she
caught
the
flash
of
relief
in
miss
verney
s
face
you
haven
t
spoken
then
how
do
you
know
how
he
feels
about
it
i
only
judge
from
well
perhaps
from
his
not
the
girl
drew
a
deep
breath
i
see
she
murmured
that
is
the
very
reason
that
prevents
his
the
reason
your
knowing
what
he
thinks
and
his
knowing
that
you
peyton
was
startled
at
her
subtlety
i
assure
you
she
said
rising
that
i
have
done
nothing
to
influence
the
girl
gazed
at
her
musingly
no
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
nothing
except
to
read
his
vi
peyton
reached
home
in
the
state
of
exhaustion
which
follows
on
a
physical
struggle
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
talk
with
clemence
verney
had
been
an
actual
combat
a
measuring
of
wrist
and
eye
for
a
moment
she
was
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
she
felt
as
though
she
had
betrayed
her
son
to
the
enemy
but
before
long
she
regained
her
moral
balance
and
saw
that
she
had
merely
shifted
the
conflict
to
the
ground
on
which
it
could
best
be
fought
out
since
the
prize
fought
for
was
the
natural
battlefield
the
reaction
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
helplessness
a
realization
that
she
had
let
the
issue
pass
out
of
her
hold
but
since
in
the
last
analysis
it
had
never
lain
there
since
it
was
above
all
needful
that
the
determining
touch
should
be
given
by
any
hand
but
hers
she
presently
found
courage
to
subside
into
inaction
she
had
done
all
she
could
even
more
perhaps
than
prudence
warranted
and
now
she
could
but
await
passively
the
working
of
the
forces
she
had
set
in
motion
for
two
days
after
her
talk
with
miss
verney
she
saw
little
of
dick
he
went
early
to
his
office
and
came
back
late
he
seemed
less
tired
more
than
during
the
first
days
after
darrow
s
death
but
there
was
a
new
inscrutableness
in
his
manner
a
note
of
reserve
of
resistance
almost
as
though
he
had
barricaded
himself
against
her
conjectures
she
had
been
struck
by
miss
verney
s
reply
to
the
anxious
asseveration
that
she
had
done
nothing
to
influence
dick
nothing
the
girl
had
answered
except
to
read
his
peyton
shrank
from
this
detection
of
a
tacit
interference
with
her
son
s
liberty
of
action
she
longed
how
passionately
he
would
never
know
to
stand
apart
from
him
in
this
struggle
between
his
two
destinies
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
that
he
on
his
side
should
hold
aloof
should
for
the
first
time
in
their
relation
seem
to
feel
her
tenderness
as
an
intrusion
only
four
days
remained
before
the
date
fixed
for
the
sending
in
of
the
designs
and
still
dick
had
not
referred
to
his
work
of
darrow
also
he
had
made
no
mention
his
mother
longed
to
know
if
he
had
spoken
to
clemence
verney
or
rather
if
the
girl
had
forced
his
confidence
peyton
was
almost
certain
that
miss
verney
would
not
remain
silent
there
were
times
when
dick
s
renewed
application
to
his
work
seemed
an
earnest
of
her
having
spoken
and
spoken
convincingly
at
the
thought
kate
s
heart
grew
chill
what
if
her
experiment
should
succeed
in
a
sense
she
had
not
intended
if
the
girl
should
reconcile
dick
to
his
weakness
should
pluck
the
sting
from
his
temptation
in
this
round
of
uncertainties
the
mother
revolved
for
two
interminable
days
but
the
second
evening
brought
an
answer
to
her
question
dick
returning
earlier
than
usual
from
the
office
had
found
on
the
a
note
which
since
morning
had
been
under
his
mother
s
observation
the
envelope
fashionable
in
tint
and
texture
was
addressed
in
a
rapid
staccato
hand
which
seemed
the
very
imprint
of
miss
verney
s
utterance
peyton
did
not
know
the
girl
s
writing
but
such
notes
had
of
late
lain
often
enough
on
the
to
make
their
attribution
easy
this
communication
dick
as
his
mother
poured
his
tea
looked
over
with
a
face
of
shifting
lights
then
he
folded
it
into
his
and
said
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
if
you
haven
t
asked
any
one
for
this
evening
i
think
i
ll
dine
do
dear
the
change
will
be
good
for
you
his
mother
assented
he
made
no
answer
but
sat
leaning
back
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
every
line
of
his
body
expressed
a
profound
physical
lassitude
but
the
face
remained
alert
and
guarded
peyton
in
silence
was
busying
herself
with
the
details
of
the
when
suddenly
inexplicably
a
question
forced
itself
to
her
lips
and
your
work
she
said
strangely
hearing
herself
speak
my
work
he
sat
up
on
the
defensive
almost
but
without
a
tremor
of
the
guarded
face
you
re
getting
on
well
you
ve
made
up
for
lost
time
oh
yes
things
are
going
he
rose
with
another
glance
at
his
watch
time
to
dress
he
said
nodding
to
her
as
he
turned
to
the
door
it
was
an
hour
later
during
her
own
solitary
dinner
that
a
ring
at
the
door
was
followed
by
the
s
announcement
that
gill
was
there
from
the
office
in
the
hall
in
fact
kate
found
her
son
s
partner
who
explained
apologetically
that
he
had
understood
peyton
was
dining
at
home
and
had
come
to
consult
him
about
a
difficulty
which
had
arisen
since
he
had
left
the
office
on
hearing
that
dick
was
out
and
that
his
mother
did
not
know
where
he
had
gone
gill
s
perplexity
became
so
manifest
that
peyton
after
a
moment
said
hesitatingly
he
may
be
at
a
friend
s
house
i
could
give
you
the
the
architect
caught
up
his
hat
thank
you
i
ll
have
a
try
for
peyton
hesitated
again
perhaps
she
suggested
it
would
be
better
to
she
led
the
way
into
the
little
study
behind
the
where
a
telephone
stood
on
the
the
folding
doors
between
the
two
rooms
were
open
should
she
close
them
as
she
passed
back
into
the
on
the
threshold
she
wavered
an
instant
then
she
walked
on
and
took
her
usual
seat
by
the
fire
gill
meanwhile
at
the
telephone
had
rung
up
the
verney
house
and
inquired
if
his
partner
were
dining
there
the
reply
was
evidently
affirmative
and
a
moment
later
kate
knew
that
he
was
in
communication
with
her
son
she
sat
motionless
her
hands
clasped
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
her
head
erect
in
an
attitude
of
avowed
attention
if
she
listened
she
would
listen
openly
there
should
be
no
suspicion
of
eavesdropping
gill
engrossed
in
his
message
was
probably
hardly
conscious
of
her
presence
but
if
he
turned
his
head
he
should
at
least
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
her
and
in
being
aware
that
she
could
hear
what
he
said
gill
however
as
she
was
quick
to
remember
was
doubtless
ignorant
of
any
need
for
secrecy
in
his
communication
to
dick
he
had
often
heard
the
affairs
of
the
office
discussed
openly
before
peyton
had
been
led
to
regard
her
as
familiar
with
all
the
details
of
her
son
s
work
he
talked
on
unconcernedly
and
she
listened
ten
minutes
later
when
he
rose
to
go
she
knew
all
that
she
had
wanted
to
find
out
long
familiarity
with
the
technicalities
of
her
son
s
profession
made
it
easy
for
her
to
translate
the
stenographic
jargon
of
the
office
she
could
lengthen
out
all
gill
s
abbreviations
interpret
all
his
allusions
and
reconstruct
dick
s
answers
from
the
questions
addressed
to
him
and
when
the
door
closed
on
the
architect
she
was
left
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
her
son
unknown
to
any
one
but
herself
was
using
darrow
s
drawings
to
complete
his
work
peyton
left
alone
found
it
easier
to
continue
her
vigil
by
the
fire
than
to
carry
up
to
the
darkness
and
silence
of
her
own
room
the
truth
she
had
been
at
such
pains
to
acquire
she
had
no
thought
of
sitting
up
for
dick
doubtless
his
dinner
over
he
would
rejoin
gill
at
the
office
and
prolong
through
the
night
the
task
in
which
she
now
knew
him
to
be
engaged
but
it
was
less
lonely
by
the
fire
than
in
the
darkness
which
awaited
her
upstairs
a
mortal
loneliness
enveloped
her
she
felt
as
though
she
had
fallen
by
the
way
spent
and
broken
in
a
struggle
of
which
even
its
object
had
been
unconscious
she
had
tried
to
deflect
the
natural
course
of
events
she
had
sacrificed
her
personal
happiness
to
a
fantastic
ideal
of
duty
and
it
was
her
punishment
to
be
left
alone
with
her
failure
outside
the
normal
current
of
human
strivings
and
regrets
she
had
no
wish
to
see
her
son
just
then
she
would
have
preferred
to
let
the
inner
tumult
subside
to
repossess
herself
in
this
new
adjustment
to
life
before
meeting
his
eyes
again
but
as
she
sat
there
far
adrift
on
her
misery
she
was
aroused
by
the
turning
of
his
key
in
the
latch
she
started
up
her
heart
sounding
a
retreat
but
her
faculties
too
dispersed
to
obey
it
and
while
she
stood
wavering
the
door
opened
and
he
was
in
the
room
in
the
room
and
with
face
illumined
a
dick
she
had
not
seen
since
the
strain
of
the
contest
had
cast
its
shade
on
him
now
he
shone
as
in
a
sunrise
of
victory
holding
out
exultant
hands
from
which
she
hung
back
instinctively
mother
i
knew
you
d
be
waiting
for
me
he
had
her
on
his
breast
now
and
his
kisses
were
in
her
hair
i
ve
always
said
you
knew
everything
that
was
happening
to
me
and
now
you
ve
guessed
that
i
wanted
you
she
was
struggling
faintly
against
the
dear
endearments
what
happened
she
murmured
drawing
back
for
a
dazzled
look
at
him
he
had
drawn
her
to
the
sofa
had
dropped
beside
her
regaining
his
hold
of
her
in
the
boyish
need
that
his
happiness
should
be
touched
and
handled
my
engagement
has
happened
he
cried
out
to
her
you
stupid
dear
do
you
need
to
be
told
vii
she
had
indeed
needed
to
be
told
the
surprise
was
complete
and
overwhelming
she
sat
silent
under
it
her
hands
trembling
in
his
till
the
blood
mounted
to
his
face
and
she
felt
his
confident
grasp
relax
you
didn
t
guess
it
then
he
exclaimed
starting
up
and
moving
away
from
her
no
i
didn
t
guess
it
she
confessed
in
a
voice
he
stood
above
her
half
challenging
half
defensive
and
you
haven
t
a
word
to
say
to
me
mother
he
adjured
her
she
rose
too
putting
her
arms
about
him
with
a
kiss
dick
dear
dick
she
murmured
she
imagines
you
don
t
like
her
she
says
she
s
always
felt
it
and
yet
she
owns
you
ve
been
delightful
that
you
ve
tried
to
make
friends
with
her
and
i
thought
you
knew
how
much
it
would
mean
to
me
just
now
to
have
this
uncertainty
over
and
that
you
d
actually
been
trying
to
help
me
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
i
thought
it
was
you
who
had
made
her
i
by
your
talk
with
her
the
other
day
she
told
me
of
your
talk
with
his
mother
s
hands
slipped
from
his
shoulders
and
she
sank
back
into
her
seat
she
felt
the
cruelty
of
her
silence
but
only
an
inarticulate
murmur
found
a
way
to
her
lips
before
speaking
she
must
clear
a
space
in
the
suffocating
rush
of
her
sensations
for
the
moment
she
could
only
repeat
inwardly
that
clemence
verney
had
yielded
before
the
final
test
and
that
she
herself
was
somehow
responsible
for
this
fresh
entanglement
of
fate
for
she
saw
in
a
flash
how
the
coils
of
circumstance
had
tightened
and
as
her
mind
cleared
it
was
filled
with
the
perception
that
this
precisely
was
what
the
girl
intended
that
this
was
why
she
had
conferred
the
crown
before
the
victory
by
pledging
herself
to
dick
she
had
secured
his
pledge
in
return
had
put
him
on
his
honour
in
a
cynical
inversion
of
the
term
kate
saw
the
succession
of
events
spread
out
before
her
like
a
map
and
the
astuteness
of
the
girl
s
policy
frightened
her
miss
verney
had
conducted
the
campaign
like
a
strategist
she
had
frankly
owned
that
her
interest
in
dick
s
future
depended
on
his
capacity
for
success
and
in
order
to
key
him
up
to
his
first
achievement
she
had
given
him
a
foretaste
of
its
results
so
much
was
almost
immediately
clear
to
peyton
but
in
a
moment
her
inferences
had
carried
her
a
point
farther
for
it
was
now
plain
to
her
that
miss
verney
had
not
risked
so
much
without
first
trying
to
gain
her
point
at
less
cost
that
if
she
had
had
to
give
herself
as
a
prize
it
was
because
no
other
bribe
had
been
sufficient
this
then
as
the
mother
saw
with
a
throb
of
hope
meant
that
dick
who
since
darrow
s
death
had
held
to
his
purpose
unwaveringly
had
been
deflected
from
it
by
the
first
hint
of
clemence
verney
s
connivance
kate
had
not
miscalculated
things
had
happened
as
she
had
foreseen
in
the
light
of
the
girl
s
approval
his
act
had
taken
an
odious
look
he
had
recoiled
from
it
and
it
was
to
revive
his
flagging
courage
that
she
had
had
to
promise
herself
to
take
him
in
the
meshes
of
her
surrender
kate
looking
up
saw
above
her
the
young
perplexity
of
her
boy
s
face
the
suspended
happiness
waiting
to
brim
over
with
a
fresh
touch
of
misery
she
said
to
herself
that
this
was
his
hour
his
one
irrecoverable
moment
and
that
she
was
darkening
it
by
her
silence
her
memory
went
back
to
the
same
hour
in
her
own
life
she
could
feel
its
heat
in
her
pulses
still
what
right
had
she
to
stand
in
dick
s
light
who
was
she
to
decide
between
his
code
and
hers
she
put
out
her
hand
and
drew
him
down
to
her
she
ll
be
the
making
of
me
you
know
mother
he
said
as
they
leaned
together
she
ll
put
new
life
in
me
she
ll
help
me
get
my
second
wind
her
talk
is
like
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
away
the
fog
in
my
head
i
never
knew
any
one
who
saw
so
straight
to
the
heart
of
things
who
had
such
a
grip
on
values
she
goes
straight
up
to
life
and
catches
hold
of
it
and
you
simply
can
t
make
her
let
he
got
up
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
then
he
came
back
and
stood
smiling
above
his
mother
you
know
you
and
i
are
rather
complicated
people
he
said
we
re
always
walking
around
things
to
get
new
views
of
them
we
re
always
rearranging
the
furniture
and
somehow
she
simplifies
life
so
he
dropped
down
beside
her
with
a
deprecating
laugh
not
that
i
mean
dear
that
it
hasn
t
been
good
for
me
to
argue
things
out
with
myself
as
you
ve
taught
me
to
only
the
man
who
stops
to
talk
is
apt
to
get
shoved
aside
nowadays
and
i
don
t
believe
milton
s
archangels
would
have
had
much
success
in
active
he
had
begun
in
a
strain
of
easy
confidence
but
as
he
went
on
she
detected
an
effort
to
hold
the
note
she
felt
that
his
words
were
being
poured
out
in
a
vain
attempt
to
fill
the
silence
which
was
deepening
between
them
she
longed
in
her
turn
to
pour
something
into
that
menacing
void
to
bridge
it
with
a
reconciling
word
or
look
but
her
soul
hung
back
and
she
had
to
take
refuge
in
a
vague
murmur
of
tenderness
my
boy
my
boy
she
repeated
and
he
sat
beside
her
without
speaking
their
alone
spanning
the
distance
which
had
widened
between
their
thoughts
the
engagement
as
kate
subsequently
learned
was
not
to
be
made
known
till
later
miss
verney
had
even
stipulated
that
for
the
present
there
should
be
no
recognition
of
it
in
her
own
family
or
in
dick
s
she
did
not
wish
to
interfere
with
his
final
work
for
the
competition
and
had
made
him
promise
as
he
laughingly
owned
that
he
would
not
see
her
again
till
the
drawings
were
sent
in
his
mother
noticed
that
he
made
no
other
allusion
to
his
work
but
when
he
bade
her
he
added
that
he
might
not
see
her
the
next
morning
as
he
had
to
go
to
the
office
early
she
took
this
as
a
hint
that
he
wished
to
be
left
alone
and
kept
her
room
the
next
day
till
the
closing
door
told
her
that
he
was
out
of
the
house
she
herself
had
waked
early
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
day
was
already
old
when
she
came
downstairs
never
had
the
house
appeared
so
empty
even
in
dick
s
longest
absences
something
of
his
presence
had
always
hung
about
the
rooms
a
fine
dust
of
memories
and
associations
which
wanted
only
the
evocation
of
her
thought
to
float
into
a
palpable
semblance
of
him
but
now
he
seemed
to
have
taken
himself
quite
away
to
have
broken
every
fibre
by
which
their
lives
had
hung
together
where
the
sense
of
him
had
been
there
was
only
a
deeper
emptiness
she
felt
as
if
a
strange
man
had
gone
out
of
her
house
she
wandered
from
room
to
room
aimlessly
trying
to
adjust
herself
to
their
solitude
she
had
known
such
loneliness
before
in
the
years
when
most
women
s
hearts
are
fullest
but
that
was
long
ago
and
the
solitude
had
after
all
been
less
complete
because
of
the
sense
that
it
might
still
be
filled
her
son
had
come
her
life
had
brimmed
over
but
now
the
tide
ebbed
again
and
she
was
left
gazing
over
a
bare
stretch
of
wasted
years
wasted
there
was
the
mortal
pang
the
stroke
from
which
there
was
no
healing
her
faith
and
hope
had
been
luring
her
to
the
wilderness
her
love
a
vain
edifice
reared
on
shifting
ground
in
her
round
of
the
rooms
she
came
at
last
to
dick
s
study
upstairs
it
was
full
of
his
boyhood
she
could
trace
the
history
of
his
past
in
its
quaint
relics
and
survivals
in
the
lingering
on
his
crowded
shelves
the
and
hung
among
his
later
treasures
all
his
successes
and
failures
his
exaltations
and
inconsistencies
were
recorded
in
the
warm
huddled
heterogeneous
room
everywhere
she
saw
the
touch
of
her
own
hand
the
vestiges
of
her
own
steps
it
was
she
alone
who
held
the
clue
to
the
labyrinth
who
could
thread
a
way
through
the
confusions
and
contradictions
of
his
past
and
her
soul
rejected
the
thought
that
his
future
could
ever
escape
from
her
she
dropped
down
into
his
shabby
college
armchair
and
hid
her
face
in
the
papers
on
his
desk
viii
the
day
dwelt
in
her
memory
as
a
long
stretch
of
aimless
hours
blind
alleys
of
time
that
led
up
to
a
dead
wall
of
inaction
toward
afternoon
she
remembered
that
she
had
promised
to
dine
out
and
go
to
the
opera
at
first
she
felt
that
the
contact
of
life
would
be
unendurable
then
she
shrank
from
shutting
herself
up
with
her
misery
in
the
end
she
let
herself
drift
passively
on
the
current
of
events
going
through
the
mechanical
routine
of
the
day
without
much
consciousness
of
what
was
happening
at
twilight
as
she
sat
in
the
the
evening
paper
was
brought
in
and
in
glancing
over
it
her
eye
fell
on
a
paragraph
which
seemed
printed
in
more
vivid
type
than
the
rest
it
was
headed
new
museum
of
and
underneath
she
read
the
artists
and
architects
selected
to
pass
on
the
competitive
designs
for
the
new
museum
will
begin
their
sittings
on
monday
and
is
the
last
day
on
which
designs
may
be
sent
in
to
the
committee
great
interest
is
felt
in
the
competition
as
the
conspicuous
site
chosen
for
the
new
building
and
the
exceptionally
large
sum
voted
by
the
city
for
its
erection
offer
an
unusual
field
for
the
display
of
architectural
she
leaned
back
closing
her
eyes
it
was
as
though
a
clock
had
struck
loud
and
inexorably
marking
off
some
irrecoverable
hour
she
was
seized
by
a
sudden
longing
to
seek
dick
out
to
fall
on
her
knees
and
plead
with
him
it
was
one
of
those
physical
obsessions
against
which
the
body
has
to
stiffen
its
muscles
as
well
as
the
mind
its
thoughts
once
she
even
sprang
up
to
ring
for
a
cab
but
she
sank
back
again
breathing
as
if
after
a
struggle
and
gripping
the
arms
of
her
chair
to
keep
herself
down
i
can
only
wait
for
him
only
wait
for
him
she
heard
herself
say
and
the
words
loosened
the
sobs
in
her
throat
at
length
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
a
ghostlike
self
looked
back
at
her
from
her
she
watched
it
performing
the
mechanical
gestures
of
the
toilet
dressing
her
as
it
appeared
without
help
from
her
actual
self
each
little
act
stood
out
sharply
against
the
blurred
background
of
her
brain
when
she
spoke
to
her
maid
her
voice
sounded
extraordinarily
loud
never
had
the
house
been
so
silent
or
stay
yes
once
she
had
felt
the
same
silence
once
when
dick
in
his
had
been
ill
of
a
fever
and
she
had
sat
up
with
him
on
the
decisive
night
the
silence
had
been
as
deep
and
as
terrible
then
and
as
she
dressed
she
had
before
her
the
vision
of
his
room
of
the
cot
in
which
he
lay
of
his
restless
head
working
a
hole
in
the
pillow
his
face
so
pinched
and
alien
under
the
familiar
freckles
it
might
be
his
she
was
keeping
the
doctors
had
warned
her
to
be
ready
and
in
the
silence
her
soul
had
fought
for
her
boy
her
love
had
hung
over
him
like
wings
her
abundant
useless
hateful
life
had
struggled
to
force
itself
into
his
empty
veins
and
she
had
succeeded
she
had
saved
him
she
had
poured
her
life
into
him
and
in
place
of
the
strange
child
she
had
watched
all
night
at
daylight
she
held
her
own
boy
to
her
breast
that
night
had
once
seemed
to
her
the
most
dreadful
of
her
life
but
she
knew
now
that
it
was
one
of
the
agonies
which
enrich
that
the
passion
thus
spent
grows
fourfold
from
its
ashes
she
could
not
have
borne
to
keep
this
new
vigil
alone
she
must
escape
from
its
sterile
misery
must
take
refuge
in
other
lives
till
she
regained
courage
to
face
her
own
at
the
opera
in
the
illumination
of
the
first
as
she
gazed
about
the
house
wondering
through
the
numb
ache
of
her
wretchedness
how
others
could
talk
and
smile
and
be
indifferent
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
jarring
animation
about
her
was
suddenly
focussed
in
the
face
of
clemence
verney
miss
verney
sat
opposite
in
the
front
of
a
crowded
box
a
box
in
which
continually
the
background
shifted
and
renewed
itself
peyton
felt
a
throb
of
anger
at
the
girl
s
bright
air
of
unconcern
she
forgot
that
she
too
was
talking
smiling
holding
out
her
hand
to
newcomers
in
a
studied
mimicry
of
life
while
her
real
self
played
out
its
tragedy
behind
the
scenes
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
to
clemence
verney
there
was
no
tragedy
in
the
situation
according
to
the
girl
s
calculations
dick
was
virtually
certain
of
success
and
unsuccess
was
to
her
the
only
conceivable
disaster
all
through
the
opera
the
sense
of
that
opposing
force
that
negation
of
her
own
beliefs
burned
itself
into
peyton
s
consciousness
the
space
between
herself
and
the
girl
seemed
to
vanish
the
throng
about
them
to
disperse
till
they
were
face
to
face
and
alone
enclosed
in
their
mortal
enmity
at
length
the
feeling
of
humiliation
and
defeat
grew
unbearable
to
peyton
the
girl
seemed
to
flout
her
in
the
insolence
of
victory
to
sit
there
as
the
visible
symbol
of
her
failure
it
was
better
after
all
to
be
at
home
alone
with
her
thoughts
as
she
drove
away
from
the
opera
she
thought
of
that
other
vigil
which
only
a
few
streets
away
dick
was
perhaps
still
keeping
she
wondered
if
his
work
were
over
if
the
final
stroke
had
been
drawn
and
as
she
pictured
him
there
signing
his
pact
with
evil
in
the
loneliness
of
the
conniving
night
an
uncontrollable
impulse
possessed
her
she
must
drive
by
his
windows
and
see
if
they
were
still
alight
she
would
not
go
up
to
him
she
dared
not
but
at
least
she
would
pass
near
to
him
would
invisibly
share
his
watch
and
hover
on
the
edge
of
his
thoughts
she
lowered
the
window
and
called
out
the
address
to
the
coachman
the
tall
loomed
silent
and
dark
as
she
approached
it
but
presently
high
up
she
caught
a
light
in
the
familiar
windows
her
heart
gave
a
leap
and
the
light
swam
on
her
through
tears
the
carriage
drew
up
and
for
a
moment
she
sat
motionless
then
the
coachman
bent
down
toward
her
and
she
saw
that
he
was
asking
if
he
should
drive
on
she
tried
to
shape
a
yes
but
her
lips
refused
it
and
she
shook
her
head
he
continued
to
lean
down
perplexedly
and
at
length
under
the
interrogation
of
his
attitude
it
became
impossible
to
sit
still
and
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
it
was
equally
impossible
to
stand
on
the
sidewalk
and
her
next
steps
carried
her
to
the
door
of
the
building
she
groped
for
the
bell
and
rang
it
feeling
still
dimly
accountable
to
the
coachman
for
some
consecutiveness
of
action
and
after
a
moment
the
night
watchman
opened
the
door
drawing
back
amazed
at
the
shining
apparition
which
confronted
him
recognizing
peyton
whom
he
had
seen
about
the
building
by
day
he
tried
to
adapt
himself
to
the
situation
by
a
vague
stammer
of
apology
i
came
to
see
if
my
son
is
still
here
she
faltered
yes
ma
am
he
s
here
he
s
been
here
most
nights
lately
till
after
and
is
gill
with
him
no
gill
he
went
away
just
after
i
come
on
this
she
glanced
up
into
the
cavernous
darkness
of
the
stairs
is
he
alone
up
there
do
you
think
yes
ma
am
i
know
he
s
alone
because
i
seen
his
men
leaving
soon
after
kate
lifted
her
head
quickly
then
i
will
go
up
to
him
she
said
the
watchman
apparently
did
not
think
it
proper
to
offer
any
comment
on
this
unusual
proceeding
and
a
moment
later
she
was
fluttering
and
rustling
up
through
the
darkness
like
a
hovering
among
rafters
there
were
ten
flights
to
climb
at
every
one
her
breath
failed
her
and
she
had
to
stand
still
and
press
her
hands
against
her
heart
then
the
weight
on
her
breast
lifted
and
she
went
on
again
upward
and
upward
the
great
dark
building
dropping
away
from
her
in
tier
after
tier
of
mute
doors
and
mysterious
corridors
at
last
she
reached
dick
s
floor
and
saw
the
light
shining
down
the
passage
from
his
door
she
leaned
against
the
wall
her
breath
coming
short
the
silence
throbbing
in
her
ears
even
now
it
was
not
too
late
to
turn
back
she
bent
over
the
stairs
letting
her
eyes
plunge
into
the
nether
blackness
with
the
single
glimmer
of
the
watchman
s
lights
in
its
depths
then
she
turned
and
stole
toward
her
son
s
door
there
again
she
paused
and
listened
trying
to
catch
through
the
hum
of
her
pulses
any
noise
that
might
come
to
her
from
within
but
the
silence
was
unbroken
it
seemed
as
though
the
office
must
be
empty
she
pressed
her
ear
to
the
door
straining
for
a
sound
she
knew
he
never
sat
long
at
his
work
and
it
seemed
unaccountable
that
she
should
not
hear
him
moving
about
the
for
a
moment
she
fancied
he
might
be
sleeping
but
sleep
did
not
come
to
him
readily
after
prolonged
mental
effort
she
recalled
the
restless
straying
of
his
feet
above
her
head
for
hours
after
he
returned
from
his
night
work
in
the
office
she
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
a
nervous
trembling
seized
her
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
latch
whispering
dick
her
whisper
sounded
loudly
through
the
silence
but
there
was
no
answer
and
after
a
pause
she
called
again
with
each
call
the
hush
seemed
to
deepen
it
closed
in
on
her
mysterious
and
impenetrable
her
heart
was
beating
in
short
frightened
leaps
a
moment
more
and
she
would
have
cried
out
she
drew
a
quick
breath
and
turned
the
the
outer
room
dick
s
private
office
with
its
red
carpet
and
stood
in
pleasant
emptiness
the
last
time
she
had
entered
it
darrow
and
clemence
verney
had
been
there
and
she
had
sat
behind
the
urn
observing
them
she
paused
a
moment
struck
now
by
a
fault
sound
from
beyond
then
she
slipped
noiselessly
across
the
carpet
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
and
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
here
the
hung
a
circle
of
brightness
over
the
great
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
table
and
floor
were
strewn
with
a
confusion
of
papers
torn
and
tracings
crumpled
sheets
of
wrenched
from
the
in
a
sudden
fury
of
destruction
and
in
the
centre
of
the
havoc
his
arms
stretched
across
the
table
and
his
face
hidden
in
them
sat
dick
peyton
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
his
mother
s
approach
and
she
stood
looking
at
him
her
breast
tightening
with
a
new
fear
dick
she
said
dick
and
he
sprang
up
staring
with
dazed
eyes
but
gradually
as
his
gaze
cleared
a
light
spread
in
it
a
mounting
brightness
of
recognition
you
ve
come
you
ve
come
he
said
stretching
his
hands
to
her
and
all
at
once
she
had
him
in
her
breast
as
in
a
shelter
you
wanted
me
she
whispered
as
she
held
him
he
looked
up
at
her
tired
breathless
with
the
white
radiance
of
the
runner
near
the
goal
i
you
dear
he
said
smiling
strangely
on
her
and
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
understanding
her
arms
had
slipped
from
his
neck
and
she
stood
leaning
on
him
in
the
shyness
of
her
discovery
for
it
might
still
be
that
he
did
not
wish
her
to
know
what
she
had
done
for
him
but
he
put
his
arm
about
her
boyishly
and
drew
her
toward
one
of
the
hard
seats
between
the
tables
and
there
on
the
bare
floor
he
knelt
before
her
and
hid
his
face
in
her
lap
she
sat
motionless
feeling
the
dear
warmth
of
his
head
against
her
knees
letting
her
hands
stray
in
faint
caresses
through
his
hair
neither
spoke
for
awhile
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
i
suppose
you
know
what
has
been
happening
to
me
he
said
she
shrank
from
seeming
to
press
into
his
life
a
hair
farther
than
he
was
prepared
to
have
her
go
her
eyes
turned
from
him
toward
the
scattered
drawings
on
the
table
you
have
given
up
the
competition
she
said
yes
and
a
lot
he
stood
up
the
wave
of
emotion
ebbing
yet
leaving
him
nearer
in
his
recovered
calmness
than
in
the
shock
of
their
first
moment
i
didn
t
know
at
first
how
much
you
guessed
he
went
on
quietly
i
was
sorry
i
d
shown
you
darrow
s
letter
but
it
didn
t
worry
me
much
because
i
didn
t
suppose
you
d
think
it
possible
that
i
should
take
advantage
of
it
it
s
only
lately
that
i
ve
understood
that
you
knew
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
i
don
t
know
yet
how
i
found
it
out
for
you
re
wonderful
about
keeping
things
to
yourself
and
you
never
made
a
sign
i
simply
felt
it
in
a
kind
of
nearness
as
if
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
oh
there
were
times
when
i
should
have
preferred
not
having
you
about
when
i
tried
to
turn
my
back
on
you
to
see
things
from
other
people
s
standpoint
but
you
were
always
there
you
wouldn
t
be
discouraged
and
i
got
tired
of
trying
to
explain
things
to
you
of
trying
to
bring
you
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
you
wouldn
t
go
away
and
you
wouldn
t
come
any
nearer
you
just
stood
there
and
watched
everything
that
i
was
he
broke
off
taking
one
of
his
restless
turns
down
the
long
room
then
he
drew
up
a
chair
beside
her
and
dropped
into
it
with
a
great
sigh
at
first
you
know
i
hated
it
most
awfully
i
wanted
to
be
let
alone
and
to
work
out
my
own
theory
of
things
if
you
d
said
a
word
if
you
d
tried
to
influence
me
the
spell
would
have
been
broken
but
just
because
the
actual
kept
apart
and
didn
t
meddle
or
pry
the
other
the
you
in
my
heart
seemed
to
get
a
tighter
hold
on
me
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
it
s
all
mixed
up
in
my
head
but
old
things
you
d
said
and
done
kept
coming
back
to
me
crowding
between
me
and
what
i
was
trying
for
looking
at
me
without
speaking
like
old
friends
i
d
gone
back
on
till
i
simply
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
i
fought
it
off
till
but
when
i
came
back
to
finish
the
work
there
you
were
again
and
suddenly
i
don
t
know
how
you
weren
t
an
obstacle
any
longer
but
a
refuge
and
i
crawled
into
your
arms
as
i
used
to
when
things
went
against
me
at
his
hands
stole
back
into
hers
and
he
leaned
his
head
against
her
shoulder
like
a
boy
i
m
an
abysmally
weak
fool
you
know
he
ended
i
m
not
worth
the
fight
you
ve
put
up
for
me
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
it
s
your
doing
that
if
you
had
let
go
an
instant
i
should
have
gone
under
and
that
if
i
d
gone
under
i
should
never
have
come
up
again
alive
