chapter
i
the
midnight
ride
about
eleven
on
the
night
of
monday
may
marshall
allerdyke
a
bachelor
of
forty
a
man
of
great
mental
and
physical
activity
well
known
in
bradford
as
a
highly
successful
manufacturer
of
dress
goods
alighted
at
the
central
station
in
that
city
from
an
express
which
had
just
arrived
from
manchester
where
he
had
spent
the
day
on
business
he
had
scarcely
set
foot
on
the
platform
when
he
was
confronted
by
his
chauffeur
a
young
man
in
a
neat
livery
who
took
his
master
travelling
rug
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
held
out
an
envelope
the
housekeeper
said
i
was
to
give
you
that
as
soon
as
you
got
in
sir
he
announced
there
a
telegram
in
it
that
came
at
four
this
afternoon
she
could
send
it
on
because
she
did
know
exactly
where
it
would
find
you
in
manchester
allerdyke
took
the
envelope
tore
it
open
drew
out
the
telegram
and
stepped
beneath
the
nearest
lamp
he
muttered
the
wording
of
the
message
board
ss
spurn
expect
to
reach
hull
this
evening
and
shall
stop
station
hotel
there
for
night
on
way
to
london
will
you
come
on
at
once
and
meet
me
want
to
see
you
on
most
important
business
james
allerdyke
this
message
quietly
and
methodically
folded
it
up
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
with
a
swift
glance
at
the
station
clock
turned
to
his
chauffeur
gaffney
he
said
how
long
would
it
take
us
to
run
across
to
hull
the
chauffeur
showed
no
surprise
at
this
question
he
had
served
allerdyke
for
three
years
and
was
well
accustomed
to
his
ways
hull
he
replied
let
see
sir
that
be
by
way
of
leeds
selby
and
howden
about
sixty
miles
in
a
straight
line
but
there
a
good
bit
of
work
after
you
get
past
selby
sir
i
should
say
about
four
hours
plenty
of
petrol
in
the
car
asked
allerdyke
turning
down
the
platform
there
is
what
time
did
you
have
your
supper
ten
sir
answered
gaffney
with
promptitude
bring
the
car
round
to
the
hotel
door
in
the
station
yard
commanded
allerdyke
you
find
a
couple
of
thermos
flasks
in
the
locker
bring
them
into
the
hotel
lounge
bar
the
chauffeur
went
off
down
the
platform
allerdyke
turned
up
the
covered
way
to
the
great
northern
hotel
when
the
chauffeur
joined
him
there
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
giving
orders
for
a
supply
of
beef
sandwiches
and
eggs
the
thermos
flasks
he
handed
over
to
be
filled
with
hot
coffee
better
get
something
to
eat
now
gaffney
he
said
get
some
sandwiches
or
some
bread
and
cheese
or
something
it
a
longish
spin
he
himself
waiting
while
the
chauffeur
ate
and
drank
and
the
provisions
were
made
ready
took
a
whisky
and
soda
to
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
once
more
pulled
out
and
read
the
telegram
and
as
he
read
he
wondered
why
his
cousin
its
sender
wished
so
particularly
to
see
him
at
once
james
allerdyke
a
man
somewhat
younger
than
himself
like
himself
a
bachelor
of
ample
means
and
of
a
similar
temperament
had
of
late
years
concerned
himself
greatly
with
various
business
speculations
in
northern
europe
and
especially
in
russia
he
had
just
been
over
to
petersburg
in
order
to
look
after
certain
of
his
affairs
in
and
near
that
city
and
he
was
returning
home
by
way
of
stockholm
and
christiania
in
each
of
which
towns
he
had
other
ventures
to
inspect
but
marshall
allerdyke
was
quite
sure
that
his
cousin
did
not
wish
to
see
him
about
any
of
these
matters
anything
connected
with
them
would
have
kept
until
they
met
in
the
ordinary
way
which
would
have
happened
within
a
day
or
two
no
if
james
had
taken
the
trouble
to
send
him
a
message
by
wireless
from
the
north
sea
it
meant
that
james
was
really
anxious
to
see
him
at
the
first
available
moment
and
would
already
have
landed
in
hull
expecting
to
find
him
there
however
with
a
good
car
smooth
roads
and
a
fine
moonlit
night
it
was
not
yet
twelve
when
allerdyke
wrapped
himself
up
in
a
corner
of
his
luxurious
saw
that
the
box
of
eatables
and
the
two
thermos
flasks
were
safe
in
the
locker
and
told
gaffney
to
go
ahead
he
himself
had
the
faculty
of
going
to
sleep
whenever
he
pleased
and
he
went
to
sleep
now
he
was
asleep
as
gaffney
went
through
leeds
and
its
suburbs
he
slept
all
along
the
country
roads
which
led
to
selby
and
thence
to
howden
but
in
the
silent
streets
of
howden
he
woke
with
a
start
to
find
that
gaffney
had
pulled
up
in
answer
to
a
question
flung
to
him
by
the
driver
of
another
car
which
had
come
alongside
their
own
from
the
opposite
direction
that
car
had
also
been
pulled
up
within
it
allerdyke
saw
a
woman
closely
wrapped
in
furs
what
is
it
gaffney
he
asked
letting
down
his
own
window
and
leaning
out
wants
to
know
which
is
the
best
way
to
get
across
the
ouse
sir
answered
gaffney
i
tell
him
there
two
ferries
close
by
one
at
booh
the
other
at
langrick
but
there
be
nobody
to
work
them
at
this
hour
where
do
you
want
to
get
to
he
went
on
turning
to
the
driver
of
the
other
car
want
to
strike
the
great
northern
main
line
somewhere
answered
the
driver
this
lady
wants
to
catch
a
scotch
express
i
thought
of
doncaster
but
the
window
of
the
other
car
was
let
down
and
its
occupant
looked
out
the
light
of
the
full
moon
shone
full
on
her
and
allerdyke
lifted
his
cap
to
a
pretty
young
woman
of
apparently
who
politely
returned
his
salutation
can
i
give
you
any
advice
asked
allerdyke
i
understand
you
want
an
express
train
to
scotland
edinburgh
replied
the
lady
i
made
out
on
arrival
at
hull
that
if
i
motored
across
country
i
would
get
a
train
at
some
station
on
the
great
northern
line
a
morning
express
doncaster
selby
york
which
is
nearest
from
wherever
we
are
this
is
howden
said
allerdyke
looking
up
at
the
great
tower
of
the
old
church
and
your
best
plan
is
to
follow
this
road
to
selby
and
then
to
york
all
the
london
expresses
stop
there
but
they
do
all
stop
at
selby
or
at
doncaster
and
there
no
road
bridge
over
the
ouse
nearer
than
selby
in
any
case
many
thanks
responded
the
lady
then
she
went
on
looking
at
her
driver
you
will
go
on
to
york
that
is
how
far
she
added
favouring
allerdyke
with
a
gracious
smile
very
far
less
than
an
hour
run
answered
gaffney
for
his
master
and
a
good
road
the
lady
bowed
allerdyke
once
more
raised
his
cap
the
two
cars
parted
company
and
allerdyke
stopped
gaffney
as
he
was
driving
off
again
and
produced
the
provisions
two
he
remarked
pulling
out
his
watch
you
come
along
in
good
style
gaffney
we
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
queer
thing
eh
for
anybody
to
motor
across
from
hull
to
catch
a
great
northern
express
on
the
main
line

be
any
trains

of

gaffney

a
handful
of
sandwiches

any
particular
time

bit
of
uphill
work
over
the
edge
of
the
wolds
now
when
we
strike
hull
go
to
the
station
hotel
he
went
to
sleep
again
as
soon
as
they
moved
out
of
howden
and
he
only
awoke
when
the
car
stopped
at
the
hotel
door
in
hull
a
hearing
the
buzz
of
the
engine
came
out
put
the
car
in
the
garage

then

from
the
christiania

towards

he
asked

the
new
arrival

gentleman

a
card
for
you
i
was
asked
to
give
it
to
you
as
soon
as
you
came
allerdyke
took
the
which
the
man
produced
from
a
letter
rack
and
read
the
lines
hastily
scribbled
on
the
back
if

the
night

straight
up
to
my
room
and
rouse
me
out

the
card
into
his
pocket
and
turned
to

to
his
room
at
once
he
said
just
show
me
the
way

he
continued
as
they
went
upstairs

it
late

from
the
sir

the
there
were
several
of
came
in
last
night
she
got
into
the
river
about
it
be
a
bit
after
nine
when
your
friend
came
in
allerdyke
mind
went
back
to
the
meeting
at
howden
did
you
have
a
lady
set
off
from
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
asked
out
of
sheer
curiosity
a
lady
in
a
oh
that
lady
exclaimed
the
with
a
grim
laugh
ah
nice
lot
of
bother
she
gave
me
too
she
was
one
of
those
passengers
she
got
in
here
with
the
rest
and
booked
a
room
and
went
to
it
all
right
and
then
at
twelve
down
she
came
and
said
she
wanted
to
get
on
and
as
there
were
no
trains
she
have
a
and
drive
to
catch
an
express
at
selby
or
doncaster
or
somewhere
nice
job
i
had
to
get
her
a
car
at
that
time
o
night
and
me
there
was
a
soul
in
the
office
then
meet
her
anywhere
sir
met
her
on
the
road
replied
allerdyke
laconically
was
she
a
foreigner
do
you
know
i
should
wonder
if
she
was
something
of
that
sort
answered
the
sort
that
would
have
her
own
way
at
all
events
here
the
room
sir
he
paused
before
the
door
of
a
room
which
stood
halfway
down
a
long
corridor
in
the
centre
of
the
hotel
and
on
its
panels
he
knocked
gently
every
room
filled
on
this
floor
sir
he
remarked
i
hope
your
friend
a
light
sleeper
for
there
some
of
have
words
to
say
if
they
roused
at
four
in
the
morning
he
a
very
light
sleeper
as
a
rule
replied
allerdyke
he
stood
listening
for
the
sound
of
some
movement
in
the
room
knock
again
he
said
when
a
minute
had
passed
without
response
on
the
part
of
the
occupant
make
it
a
bit
louder
the
with
evident
unwillingness
repeated
his
summons
this
time
loud
enough
to
wake
any
ordinary
sound
sleeper
but
no
sound
came
from
within
the
room
and
after
a
third
and
much
louder
thumping
at
the
door
allerdyke
grew
impatient
and
suspicious
this
is
queer
he
growled
my
cousin
one
of
the
lightest
sleepers
i
ever
knew
if
he
in
there
there
something
wrong
look
here
have
to
open
that
door
have
you
got
a
key
key
be
inside
sir
replied
the
but
there
a
to
all
these
doors
in
the
office
shall
i
fetch
it
then
do
said
allerdyke
curtly
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
corridor
when
the
man
had
hurried
away
wondering
what
this
soundness
of
sleep
in
his
cousin
meant
james
allerdyke
was
not
a
man
who
took
either
drink
or
drugs
and
marshall
experience
of
him
was
that
the
least
sound
awoke
him
queer
he
repeated
as
he
marched
up
and
down
perhaps
he
not
the
quiet
opening
of
a
door
close
by
made
him
lift
his
eyes
from
the
carpet
in
the
dim
light
he
saw
a
man
looking
out
upon
him
a
man
of
an
unusually
thick
crop
of
hair
and
with
a
huge
beard
he
stared
at
allerdyke
half
angrily
half
sulkily
then
he
closed
his
door
as
quietly
as
he
had
opened
it
and
allerdyke
turning
back
to
his
cousin
room
mechanically
laid
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
screwed
it
round
the
door
was
open
allerdyke
drew
a
sharp
breath
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
had
stayed
in
that
hotel
often
and
he
knew
where
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
should
be
he
lifted
a
hand
found
the
switch
and
turned
the
light
on
and
as
it
flooded
the
room
he
pulled
himself
up
to
a
tense
rigidity
there
sitting
fully
dressed
in
an
easy
chair
against
which
his
head
was
thrown
back
was
his
cousin
unmistakably
dead
chapter
ii
the
dead
man
for
a
full
minute
marshall
allerdyke
stood
fixed
staring
at
the
set
features
before
him
then
with
a
quick
catching
of
his
breath
he
made
one
step
to
his
cousin
side
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
unyielding
shoulder
the
affectionate
familiar
terms
in
which
they
had
always
addressed
each
other
sprang
involuntarily
to
his
lips
why
james
my
lad
he
exclaimed
james
lad
james
even
as
he
spoke
he
knew
that
james
would
never
hear
word
or
sound
again
in
this
world
it
needed
no
more
than
one
glance
at
the
rigid
features
one
touch
of
the
already
fixed
and
body
to
know
that
james
allerdyke
was
not
only
dead
but
had
been
dead
some
time
and
with
a
shuddering
sigh
marshall
allerdyke
drew
himself
up
and
looked
round
at
his
surroundings
nothing
could
have
been
more
peaceful
than
that
quiet
hotel
bedroom
nothing
more
orderly
than
its
arrangements
allerdyke
had
always
known
his
cousin
for
a
man
of
unusually
tidy
and
methodical
habits
the
evidence
of
that
orderliness
was
there
where
he
had
pitched
his
camp
for
presumably
a
single
night
his
toilet
articles
were
spread
out
on
the
his
pyjamas
were
laid
across
his
pillow
his
open
lay
on
a
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
by
the
bedside
lay
his
slippers
an
overcoat
hung
from
one
peg
of
the
door
a
from
another
on
a
chair
in
a
corner
lay
neatly
folded
a
couple
of
travelling
rugs
all
these
little
details
allerdyke
sharp
eyes
took
in
at
a
glance
he
turned
from
them
to
the
things
nearer
the
dead
man
james
allerdyke
sat
in
a
big
easy
chair
placed
at
the
side
of
a
round
table
set
towards
a
corner
of
the
room
he
was
fully
dressed
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
but
he
had
taken
off
one
boot
the
left
and
it
lay
at
his
feet
on
the
hearthrug
he
himself
was
thrown
back
against
the
hood
of
the
chair
there
was
a
little
frown
on
his
set
features
a
tiny
puckering
of
the
brows
above
his
closed
eyes
his
hands
were
lying
at
his
sides
unclasped
the
fingers
slightly
stretched
the
thumbs
slightly
turned
inward
everything
looked
as
if
in
the
very
act
of
taking
off
his
boots
some
sudden
spasm
of
pain
had
seized
him
and
he
had
sat
up
leaned
back
and
died
as
swiftly
as
the
seizure
had
come
there
was
a
slight
blueness
under
the
lower
rims
of
the
eyes
a
corresponding
tint
on
the
upper
lip
but
neither
that
nor
the
pallor
which
had
long
since
settled
on
the
rigid
features
had
given
anything
of
ghastliness
to
the
face
the
dead
man
lay
back
in
his
chair
in
such
an
easy
posture
that
but
for
his
utter
quietness
his
intense
immobility
he
might
have
well
been
taken
for
one
who
was
hard
and
fast
asleep
the
sound
of
the
returning
footsteps
sent
allerdyke
out
into
the
corridor
unconsciously
he
shook
his
head
and
raised
a
hand
as
if
to
warn
the
man
against
noise
sh
he
said
still
acting
and
speaking
mechanically
here
i
knew
something
was
wrong
the
fact
is
my
cousin
dead
in
his
surprise
the
dropped
the
key
which
he
had
been
to
fetch
when
he
straightened
himself
from
picking
it
up
his
ruddy
face
had
paled
dead
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
him
why
he
looked
the
picture
of
health
last
night
i
noticed
that
of
him
anyway
he
dead
now
said
allerdyke
he
lying
there
dead
come
in
the
door
along
the
corridor
from
which
the
man
of
the
shock
head
and
great
beard
had
looked
out
opened
again
and
the
big
head
was
protruded
its
owner
seeing
the
two
standing
there
came
out
anything
wrong
he
asked
advancing
towards
them
in
his
pyjamas
if
there
any
illness
i
a
medical
man
can
i
be
of
use
allerdyke
turned
sharply
looking
the
stranger
well
over
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
man
was
an
englishman
or
a
foreigner
he
fancied
that
he
detected
a
slightly
foreign
accent
the
tone
was
and
even
kindly
i
obliged
to
you
replied
allerdyke
in
his
characteristically
blunt
fashion
i
afraid
nobody
can
be
of
use
the
truth
is
i
came
to
join
my
cousin
here
and
i
find
him
dead
seems
to
me
he
been
dead
some
time
as
you
a
doctor
you
can
tell
of
course
perhaps
you
come
in
he
led
the
way
back
into
the
bedroom
the
other
two
following
closely
behind
him
at
sight
of
the
dead
man
the
bearded
stranger
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
ah
he
said
mr
allerdyke
you
knew
him
then
demanded
marshall
you
met
him
the
other
who
had
stooped
over
the
body
bestowing
a
light
touch
on
face
and
hand
looked
up
and
nodded
i
came
over
with
him
from
christiania
he
answered
i
met
him
there
at
a
hotel
i
had
several
conversations
with
him
in
fact
i
warned
him
warned
him
of
what
asked
allerdyke
replied
the
doctor
quietly
i
saw
symptoms
of
that
was
why
i
talked
with
him
i
gathered
from
what
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
man
who
lived
a
very
strenuous
life
and
i
warned
him
against
doing
too
much
he
was
not
fitted
for
it
good
lord
exclaimed
allerdyke
with
obvious
impatience
why
i
always
considered
him
as
one
of
the
fittest
men
i
ever
knew
perhaps
you
did
said
the
doctor
laymen
sir
do
not
see
what
a
trained
eye
sees
the
proof
in
his
case
is
there
he
pointed
to
the
dead
man
at
whom
the
was
staring
with
astonished
eyes
allerdyke
stared
too
or
seemed
to
stare
in
reality
he
was
gazing
into
space
wondering
about
what
had
just
been
said
then
you
think
he
died
a
natural
death
he
asked
suddenly
turning
on
his
companion
you
do
think
there
anything
wrong
the
doctor
shook
his
head
calmly
i
think
he
died
of
precisely
what
i
should
have
expected
him
to
die
of
he
answered
heart
failure
it
came
upon
him
quite
suddenly
you
see
he
was
in
the
act
of
taking
off
his
boots
he
is
a
little
fleshy
stout
the
exertion
of
bending
over
and
down
that
was
too
much
he
felt
a
sharp
spasm
he
sat
back
he
died
there
and
then
there
and
then
repeated
allerdyke
mechanically
well
what
to
be
done
he
went
on
what
is
done
in
these
cases
i
suppose
you
know
there
will
have
to
be
an
inquest
later
on
answered
the
doctor
i
can
give
evidence
for
you
if
you
like
i
am
staying
in
hull
for
a
few
days
for
i
can
certainly
testify
to
what
i
had
observed
but
that
comes
later
at
present
you
had
better
acquaint
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
i
should
suggest
sending
for
a
local
medical
man
there
are
some
eminent
men
of
my
profession
in
this
town
and
the
body
should
be
laid
out
go
and
dress
and
then
do
what
i
can
for
you
much
obliged
responded
allerdyke
very
kind
of
you
what
name
sir
my
name
is
lydenberg
replied
the
stranger
i
will
give
you
my
card
presently
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
allerdyke
pulled
out
his
own
my
name
marshall
allerdyke
he
answered
i
his
cousin
he
went
on
with
another
glance
at
the
still
figure
and
my
conscience
i
never
thought
to
find
him
like
this
i
never
heard
of
any
weakness
on
his
part
i
always
thought
him
a
particularly
strong
man
you
will
send
for
another
medical
man
asked
lydenberg
it
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
you
yes
i
see
to
that
replied
allerdyke
he
turned
to
look
at
the
who
was
still
hanging
about
as
if
fascinated
look
here
he
said
we
do
want
any
fuss
just
rouse
the
manager
quietly
and
ask
him
to
come
here
and
find
that
chauffeur
of
mine
and
tell
him
i
want
him
now
then
what
about
a
doctor
do
you
know
a
real
one
there
several
within
ten
minutes
sir
answered
the
there
orwin
in
coltman
street
he
generally
fetched
here
i
can
get
a
man
to
go
for
him
at
once
do
commanded
allerdyke
but
send
me
my
driver
first
i
want
him
tell
him
what
happened
he
waited
standing
and
staring
at
his
dead
cousin
until
gaffney
came
hurrying
along
the
corridor
allerdyke
beckoned
him
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
gaffney
he
said
you
see
how
things
are
james
is
dead
i
found
him
sitting
there
dead
he
been
dead
some
time
hours
there
a
doctor
a
foreigner
i
think
across
the
passage
there
who
says
been
heart
failure
i
sent
for
another
doctor
now
in
the
meantime
i
want
to
see
what
my
cousin
got
on
him
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
take
everything
off
him
in
the
way
of
valuables
papers
and
so
on
and
put
in
that
small
of
his
master
and
man
went
methodically
to
work
and
an
observer
of
an
unduly
sentimental
shade
of
mind
might
have
said
that
there
was
something
almost
callous
about
their
measured
proceedings
but
marshall
allerdyke
was
a
man
of
eminently
thorough
and
practical
habits
and
he
was
doing
what
he
did
with
an
idea
and
a
purpose
his
cousin
might
have
died
from
sudden
heart
failure
again
he
might
not
there
might
have
been
foul
play
there
might
have
been
one
of
many
reasons
for
his
unexpected
death
anyway
in
allerdyke
opinion
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
exactly
what
james
was
carrying
about
his
person
when
death
took
place
there
was
a
small
on
the
allerdyke
opened
it
and
took
out
all
its
contents
they
were
few
a
muffler
a
a
book
or
two
some
foreign
newspapers
a
russian
a
flask
the
various
odds
and
ends
small
unimportant
things
which
a
voyager
by
sea
and
land
picks
up
allerdyke
took
all
these
out
and
laying
them
aside
on
the
table
directed
gaffney
to
take
everything
from
the
dead
man
pockets
and
gaffney
solemn
of
face
and
tight
of
lip
set
to
his
task
in
silence
there
was
comparatively
little
to
bring
to
light
a
watch
and
chain
the
small
pocket
articles
which
every
man
carries
keys
a
monocle
eyeglass
a
purse
full
of
gold
loose
silver
a
containing
a
considerable
sum
in
some
english
some
foreign
letters
and
papers
a
pocket
diary
these
were
all
allerdyke
took
each
as
gaffney
produced
them
and
placed
each
in
the
bag
with
no
more
than
a
mere
glance
everything
there
is
sir
whispered
the
chauffeur
at
last
i
been
through
every
pocket
allerdyke
found
the
key
of
the
bag
locked
it
and
set
it
aside
on
the
mantelpiece
then
he
went
over
to
the
lying
on
the
bench
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
closed
and
locked
it
and
dropped
the
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
and
just
then
lydenberg
came
back
dressed
and
on
his
heels
came
the
manager
of
the
hotel
startled
and
anxious
and
with
him
an
elderly
man
whom
he
introduced
as
orwin
when
james
allerdyke
dead
body
had
been
lifted
on
to
the
bed
and
the
two
medical
men
had
begun
a
whispered
conversation
beside
it
allerdyke
drew
the
hotel
manager
aside
to
a
corner
of
the
room
did
you
see
anything
of
my
cousin
when
he
arrived
last
night
he
asked
not
when
he
arrived
no
replied
the
manager
but
later
yes
i
had
some
slight
conversation
with
him
after
he
had
taken
supper
it
was
nothing
much
he
merely
wished
to
know
if
there
was
always
a
on
duty
he
said
he
expected
a
friend
who
might
turn
up
at
any
hour
of
the
night
and
he
wanted
to
leave
a
card
for
him
that
would
be
you
i
suppose
sir
just
so
replied
allerdyke
now
how
did
he
seem
at
that
time
and
what
time
was
that
ten
said
the
manager
seem
well
sir
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
very
best
of
health
and
spirits
i
was
astonished
to
hear
that
he
was
dead
i
never
saw
a
man
look
more
like
living
he
was
the
elderly
doctor
came
away
from
the
bed
approaching
allerdyke
after
hearing
what
lydenberg
tells
me
and
examining
the
body
a
mere
perfunctory
examination
as
yet
you
know
i
have
little
doubt
that
this
gentleman
died
of
what
is
commonly
called
heart
failure
he
said
there
will
have
to
be
an
inquest
of
course
and
it
may
be
advisable
to
make
a
examination
you
are
a
relative
cousin
replied
allerdyke
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
spoke
bluntly
you
do
think
it
been
a
case
of
poisoning
do
you
he
said
orwin
pursed
his
lips
and
regarded
his
questioner
narrowly
do
you
mean
he
asked
administered
any
way
answered
allerdyke
self
or
otherwise
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
spoke
determinedly
i
do
understand
about
this
notion
he
went
on
i
never
heard
him
complain
of
his
heart
he
was
a
strong
active
man
hearty
and
full
of
go
i
want
to
know
everything
there
should
certainly
be
an
autopsy
murmured
orwin
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
temporary
colleague
who
nodded
as
if
in
assent
then
he
turned
back
to
allerdyke
if
you
leave
us
for
a
while
we
will
just
make
a
further
examination
then
we
speak
to
you
later
allerdyke
signified
his
assent
with
a
curt
nod
of
the
head
accompanied
by
the
manager
and
gaffney
he
left
the
room
and
with
him
he
carried
the
small
in
which
he
had
placed
the
dead
man
personal
effects
chapter
iii
the
shoe
buckle
once
outside
the
allerdyke
asked
the
manager
to
give
him
a
bedroom
with
a
attached
to
it
and
to
put
gaffney
in
another
room
close
by
he
should
be
obliged
he
said
to
stay
at
the
hotel
until
the
inquest
was
over
and
arrangements
had
been
made
for
his
funeral
the
manager
at
once
took
him
to
a
suite
of
three
rooms
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
which
they
were
then
in
allerdyke
took
it
at
once
sent
gaffney
down
to
bring
up
certain
things
from
the
car
and
detained
the
manager
for
a
moment
conversation
i
suppose
you
a
fair
lot
of
people
come
in
last
night
from
that
christiania
boat
he
asked
some
fifteen
or
twenty
answered
the
manager
did
you
happen
to
see
my
cousin
in
conversation
with
any
of
them
inquired
allerdyke
the
manager
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
not
definitely
sure
about
that
he
had
a
notion
that
he
had
seen
james
allerdyke
talking
with
some
of
the
passengers
but
the
notion
was
vague
you
know
how
it
is
he
went
on
people
come
in
they
stand
about
talking
in
the
hall
groups
you
know
they
go
from
one
to
another
i
think
i
saw
him
talking
to
that
doctor
who
in
there
now
with
orwin
the
man
with
the
big
beard
and
to
a
lady
who
came
at
the
same
time
there
were
several
ladies
in
the
party
the
passengers
were
all
about
in
the
hall
and
in
the
and
so
on
there
are
a
lot
of
other
people
in
the
house
too
of
course
it
this
way
said
allerdyke
i
not
at
all
satisfied
about
what
these
doctors
say
so
far
they
may
be
right
of
course
probably
are
still
i
want
to
know
all
i
can
and
naturally
i
like
to
know
who
the
people
were
that
my
cousin
was
last
in
company
with
you
never
know
what
may
have
happened
there
often
something
that
does
show
at
first
there
was
nothing
missing
in
his
room
i
hope
asked
the
manager
with
professional
anxiety
nothing
that
i
know
of
answered
allerdyke
my
man
and
i
have
searched
him
and
taken
possession
of
everything
all
that
he
had
on
him
is
in
that
bag
and
i
going
to
examine
it
now
no
i
do
think
anything
had
been
taken
from
him
judging
by
what
i
seen
you
would
like
me
to
send
for
the
police
suggested
the
manager
not
at
present
replied
allerdyke
not
at
any
rate
until
these
doctors
say
something
more
definite
they
know
more
presently
no
doubt
of
course
you
a
list
of
all
the
people
who
came
in
last
night
they
would
all
register
answered
the
manager
but
then
you
know
sir
many
of
them
will
be
going
this
morning
most
of
them
are
only
breaking
their
journey
you
can
look
over
the
register
whenever
you
like
later
on
said
allerdyke
in
the
meantime
i
examine
these
things
send
me
up
some
coffee
as
soon
as
your
people
are
stirring
he
unlocked
the
when
the
manager
had
left
him
it
seemed
to
his
practical
and
methodical
mind
that
his
first
duty
was
to
make
himself
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
various
personal
effects
which
he
and
gaffney
had
found
on
the
dead
man
of
the
valuables
he
took
little
notice
it
was
very
evident
in
his
opinion
that
if
james
death
had
been
brought
about
by
some
sort
of
foul
play
a
suspicion
which
had
instantly
crossed
his
mind
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
his
cousin
was
dead
the
object
of
his
destroyer
had
not
been
robbery
james
had
always
been
accustomed
to
carrying
a
considerable
sum
of
money
on
him
gaffney
search
had
brought
a
considerable
sum
to
light
james
also
wore
a
very
valuable
watch
and
chain
and
two
fine
diamond
rings
there
they
all
were
not
robbery
no
at
least
not
robbery
of
the
ordinary
sort
but
had
there
been
robbery
of
another
a
bigger
a
subtle
and
sort
james
was
a
man
of
many
affairs
and
schemes
he
might
have
had
valuable
securities
papers
relating
to
designs
papers
containing
secrets
of
great
moment
he
was
interested
for
example
in
several
patents
he
might
have
had
documents
pertinent
to
some
affair
of
such
importance
that
folk
eager
to
seize
them
might
have
murdered
him
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
them
there
were
many
possibilities
and
there
was
always
to
allerdyke
mind
the
improbability
that
james
had
died
through
sudden
illness
now
that
marshall
allerdyke
mind
was
clearing
getting
free
of
the
first
effects
of
the
sudden
shock
of
finding
his
cousin
dead
doubt
and
uneasiness
as
to
the
whole
episode
were
rising
strongly
within
him
he
and
james
had
been
brought
up
together
they
had
never
been
apart
from
each
other
for
more
than
a
few
months
at
a
time
during
years
and
he
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
james
as
well
as
any
man
of
acquaintance
he
could
not
remember
that
his
cousin
had
ever
made
any
complaint
of
illness
or
indisposition
he
had
certainly
never
had
any
serious
sickness
in
his
life
as
to
heart
trouble
allerdyke
knew
that
a
few
years
previous
to
his
death
james
had
taken
out
a
with
a
office
and
had
been
passed
as
a
life
he
remembered
as
he
sat
there
thinking
over
these
things
the
grin
with
which
james
had
come
and
told
him
that
the
examining
doctor
had
declared
him
to
be
as
sound
as
a
bell
it
was
true
of
course
that
disease
might
have
set
in
after
that
still
it
was
only
six
weeks
since
he
had
seen
james
and
james
was
then
looking
in
a
fit
healthy
hearty
state
he
had
gone
off
on
one
of
his
russian
journeys
as
full
of
life
and
spirits
as
a
man
could
be
and
had
not
the
hotel
manager
just
said
that
he
seemed
full
of
health
full
of
go
at
ten
last
night
and
yet
within
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
according
to
what
the
medical
men
thought
from
their
hurried
examination
this
active
vigorous
man
was
dead
swiftly
and
mysteriously
dead
allerdyke
felt
felt
intensely
that
there
was
something
deeply
strange
in
all
this
and
yet
it
was
beyond
him
with
his
limited
knowledge
to
account
for
james
sudden
death
except
on
the
hypothesis
suggested
by
the
two
doctors
all
sorts
of
vague
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
was
there
any
person
who
desired
james
death
had
any
one
tracked
him
to
this
place
got
rid
of
him
by
some
subtle
means
had
pshaw
he
muttered
suddenly
interrupting
his
train
of
thought
and
recognizing
how
shapeless
and
futile
it
all
was
it
just
comes
to
this
i
asking
myself
if
the
poor
lad
was
murdered
and
what
have
i
to
go
on
naught
naught
at
all
nevertheless
there
were
papers
before
him
which
had
been
taken
from
james
pocket
there
was
the
little
journal
or
diary
which
he
always
carried
and
in
which
to
allerdyke
knowledge
he
always
jotted
down
a
brief
note
of
each
day
proceedings
wherever
he
went
he
could
examine
these
at
any
rate
they
might
cast
some
light
on
his
recent
doings
he
began
with
the
diary
turning
over
its
pages
until
he
came
to
the
date
on
which
james
had
left
bradford
for
petersburg
that
was
on
march
he
had
travelled
to
the
russian
capital
overland
by
way
of
berlin
and
vilna
at
each
of
which
places
he
had
evidently
broken
his
journey
from
petersburg
he
had
gone
on
to
moscow
where
he
had
spent
the
better
part
of
a
week
all
his
movements
were
clearly
set
out
in
the
brief
pencilled
entries
in
the
journal
from
moscow
he
had
returned
to
petersburg
there
he
had
stayed
a
fortnight
thence
he
had
journeyed
to
revel
from
revel
he
had
crossed
the
baltic
to
stockholm
from
stockholm
he
had
gone
across
country
to
christiania
and
from
christiania
he
had
sailed
for
hull
to
meet
his
death
in
that
adjacent
room
where
the
doctors
were
now
busied
with
his
body
marshall
allerdyke
though
he
had
no
actual
monetary
connection
with
them
had
always
possessed
a
fairly
accurate
knowledge
of
his
business
affairs
james
was
the
sort
of
man
who
talked
freely
to
his
intimates
about
his
doings
therefore
allerdyke
was
able
to
make
out
from
the
journal
what
james
had
done
during
his
stay
at
petersburg
in
moscow
in
revel
and
in
stockholm
in
all
of
which
places
he
had
irons
of
one
sort
or
another
in
the
fire
he
recognized
the
names
of
various
firms
upon
which
james
had
called
these
names
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
those
of
the
big
manufacturing
concerns
in
his
own
town
james
had
been
to
see
this
man
this
man
had
been
to
see
james
he
had
dined
with
such
an
one
such
an
one
had
dined
with
him
ordinarily
innocent
entries
all
these
there
was
no
subtle
significance
to
be
attached
to
any
of
them
they
were
just
the
sort
of
entries
which
the
busy
commercial
man
engaged
in
operations
of
some
magnitude
would
make
for
his
own
convenience
there
was
in
short
nothing
in
that
tiny
book
a
mere
sort
of
affair
which
allerdyke
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
or
which
excited
any
wonder
or
speculation
in
him
with
one
exception
that
exception
was
in
three
entries
brief
bald
mere
lines
all
made
during
james
second
stay
the
fortnight
period
in
petersburg
they
were
april
met
princess
april
lunched
with
princess
april
princess
dined
with
me
these
entries
puzzled
allerdyke
his
cousin
had
been
going
over
to
russia
at
least
twice
a
year
for
three
years
but
he
had
never
heard
him
mention
that
he
had
formed
the
acquaintance
of
any
person
of
princely
rank
who
was
this
princess
with
whom
james
had
evidently
become
on
such
friendly
terms
that
they
had
lunched
and
dined
together
james
had
twice
written
to
him
during
his
absence
he
had
both
letters
in
his
pocket
then
and
one
of
them
was
dated
from
petersburg
on
april
but
there
was
no
mention
of
any
princess
in
either
seeking
for
an
explanation
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
james
who
had
a
slight
weakness
for
the
society
of
ladies
connected
with
the
stage
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
actress
or
other
singer
artiste
and
had
given
her
the
nickname
of
princess
that
was
all
there
was
to
be
got
from
the
diary
it
amounted
to
nothing
there
were
however
the
loose
papers
he
began
to
examine
these
methodically
they
were
few
in
number
james
was
the
sort
of
man
who
never
keeps
anything
which
can
be
destroyed
allerdyke
knew
from
experience
that
he
had
a
horror
of
accumulating
what
he
called
rubbish
these
papers
fastened
together
with
a
band
of
were
all
business
documents
with
one
exception
a
letter
from
allerdyke
himself
addressed
to
stockholm
to
wait
james
arrival
there
were
some
specifications
relating
to
building
property
there
was
a
schedule
of
the
timber
then
standing
in
a
certain
pine
forest
in
sweden
in
which
james
had
a
valuable
share
there
was
a
of
a
moscow
trading
concern
in
which
he
had
invested
money
there
were
odds
and
ends
of
a
similar
nature
all
financial
from
these
papers
allerdyke
could
only
select
one
which
he
did
not
understand
which
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
this
was
a
telegram
dispatched
from
london
on
april
at
eleven
in
the
morning
he
spread
it
out
on
the
table
and
slowly
read
it
to
grand
your
wire
received
if
princess
will
confide
goods
to
your
care
to
personally
bring
over
here
have
no
doubt
matter
can
be
speedily
and
satisfactorily
arranged
have
important
client
now
in
town
until
middle
may
who
seems
to
be
best
man
to
approach
and
is
likely
to
be
a
generous
buyer
franklin
fullaway
waldorf
hotel
london
here
was
another
surprise
allerdyke
had
never
in
his
life
heard
james
mention
the
name
franklin
fullaway
yet
here
franklin
fullaway
whoever
he
might
be
was
wiring
to
james
as
only
a
business
acquaintance
of
some
standing
would
wire
and
here
again
was
the
mention
of
a
princess
presumably
nay
evidently
the
princess
to
whom
reference
was
made
in
the
diary
and
there
was
mention
too
of
goods
probably
valuable
goods
to
be
confided
to
james
care
for
conveyance
to
england
to
london
for
sale
to
some
prospective
purchaser
if
james
had
brought
them
where
were
they
so
far
as
allerdyke
had
ascertained
james
had
no
luggage
beyond
his
big
suitcase
and
the
handbag
which
now
stood
on
the
table
before
his
own
eyes
he
was
a
man
for
travelling
light
james
and
never
encumbered
himself
with
more
than
indispensable
necessities
where
then
a
tap
at
the
door
of
the
prefaced
the
entry
of
the
two
medical
men
we
heard
from
the
manager
that
you
were
in
this
room
allerdyke
said
orwin
well
we
made
a
further
examination
of
your
relative
and
we
still
incline
to
the
opinion
expressed
already
now
if
you
approve
it
i
will
arrange
at
once
for
communicating
with
the
coroner
removing
the
body
and
having
an
autopsy
performed
as
lydenberg
has
business
in
the
town
which
will
keep
him
here
a
few
days
he
will
join
me
and
it
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
you
no
doubt
if
another
doctor
is
called
i
should
advise
the
professional
police
surgeon
if
you
will
leave
it
to
me
i
leave
everything
of
that
sort
to
you
doctor
said
allerdyke
much
obliged
to
both
of
you
gentlemen
you
understand
what
i
anxious
about
i
want
to
be
certain
certain
mind
you
of
the
cause
of
my
cousin
death
now
you
speak
of
removing
him
then
i
just
go
and
take
a
look
at
him
before
that
done
he
presently
locked
up
his
rooms
leaving
the
there
also
locked
and
went
alone
to
the
room
in
which
james
lay
dead
most
folks
who
knew
marshall
allerdyke
considered
him
a
hard
unsentimental
man
but
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
stooped
over
his
cousin
body
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
cold
forehead
once
more
he
broke
into
familiar
muttered
speech
if
there
been
aught
wrong
lad
he
said
aught
foul
or
underhand
i
right
thee
by
god
i
will
then
he
stooped
lower
and
kissed
the
dead
man
cheek
and
pressed
the
still
hands
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
turned
away
and
regained
his
and
it
was
in
that
moment
that
his
eyes
slightly
blurred
as
they
were
caught
sight
of
an
object
which
lay
by
a
corner
of
the
a
glittering
shining
object
which
threw
back
the
gleam
of
the
still
burning
electric
light
he
strode
across
the
room
and
picked
it
up
the
gold
buckle
of
a
woman
shoe
studded
with
real
if
tiny
diamonds
chapter
iv
franklin
fullaway
allerdyke
carried
his
find
away
to
his
own
room
and
carefully
examined
it
the
buckle
was
of
real
gold
the
stones
set
in
it
were
real
diamonds
small
though
they
were
he
deduced
two
ideas
from
these
facts
one
that
the
owner
was
a
woman
who
loved
pretty
and
expensive
things
the
other
that
she
must
have
a
certain
natural
carelessness
about
her
not
to
have
noticed
that
the
buckle
was
loose
on
her
shoe
but
as
he
put
the
buckle
safely
away
in
his
own
travelling
bag
he
began
to
speculate
on
matters
of
deeper
import
how
did
it
come
to
be
lying
there
in
james
room
how
long
had
it
been
lying
there
had
its
owner
been
into
that
room
recently
had
she
in
fact
been
in
the
room
since
james
allerdyke
took
possession
of
it
on
his
arrival
at
the
hotel
he
realized
the
possibility
of
various
answers
to
these
questions
the
buckle
might
have
been
dropped
by
a
former
occupant
of
the
room
but
was
that
likely
would
an
object
sparkling
with
diamonds
have
escaped
the
eyes
of
even
a
careless
chambermaid
would
it
have
escaped
the
keener
eyes
of
james
allerdyke
anyhow
that
question
could
easily
be
settled
by
finding
out
how
long
that
particular
room
had
been
unoccupied
before
james
was
put
into
it
a
much
more
important
question
was
had
the
owner
of
the
buckle
been
in
the
room
between
nine
of
the
previous
evening
and
five
that
morning
out
of
that
again
rose
certain
supplementary
questions
what
had
she
been
doing
there
and
most
important
of
all
who
was
she
that
might
possibly
be
solved
by
an
inspection
of
the
hotel
register
and
after
he
had
drunk
the
coffee
which
was
presently
brought
up
to
him
allerdyke
went
down
to
the
office
to
set
about
that
necessary
yet
problematic
task
as
he
reached
the
big
hall
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
hotel
the
manager
came
across
to
him
displaying
a
telegram
for
your
cousin
sir
he
announced
handing
it
over
to
allerdyke
just
come
in
allerdyke
slowly
opened
the
envelope
and
as
he
unfolded
the
message
caught
the
name
franklin
fullaway
at
its
foot
let
me
know
what
time
you
arrive
king
cross
and
i
will
meet
you
highly
important
we
should
both
see
my
prospective
client
at
once
this
message
bore
the
same
address
which
allerdyke
had
found
in
the
telegram
discovered
in
james
waldorf
hotel
and
he
determined
to
wire
franklin
fullaway
immediately
he
sat
down
at
a
in
the
hall
and
drew
a
sheaf
of
telegraph
forms
towards
him
but
it
was
not
easy
to
compose
the
message
which
he
wished
to
send
he
knew
nothing
of
the
man
to
whom
he
must
address
it
nothing
of
his
business
relations
with
james
he
had
no
clear
notion
of
what
the
present
particular
transaction
was
nor
how
it
might
be
connected
with
what
had
just
happened
after
considerable
thought
he
wrote
out
a
telegram
of
some
length
and
carried
it
himself
to
the
telegraph
office
in
the
station
outside
to
fullaway
waldorf
hotel
your
wire
to
james
allerdyke
opened
by
undersigned
his
cousin
james
allerdyke
died
suddenly
here
during
night
circumstances
somewhat
mysterious
investigation
proceeding
have
found
on
body
your
telegram
to
him
of
april
glad
if
you
can
explain
business
referred
to
therein
or
give
any
other
information
about
his
recent
doings
abroad
from
marshall
allerdyke
station
hotel
hull
it
was
by
that
time
eight
and
the
railway
station
and
the
hotel
had
started
into
the
business
of
another
day
there
were
signs
that
people
who
had
stayed
in
the
hotel
were
about
to
take
their
departure
by
early
trains
and
allerdyke
hastened
back
to
the
office
to
look
over
the
register
he
was
anxious
to
know
who
and
what
the
folk
were
who
had
been
near
and
about
his
cousin
in
his
last
hours
but
a
mere
glance
at
the
big
pages
showed
him
the
uselessness
of
his
task
there
were
some
seventy
or
eighty
entries
made
during
the
previous
hours
it
was
impossible
to
go
into
the
circumstances
of
each
he
turned
with
a
look
of
despair
to
the
manager
at
his
elbow
nothing
much
to
be
made
out
of
that
he
muttered
still
which
are
the
people
who
came
off
the
last
night
the
manager
summoned
a
clerk
the
clerk
indicated
a
sequence
of
entries
amongst
which
allerdyke
at
once
noticed
the
name
of
lydenberg
the
rest
were
of
course
unfamiliar
to
him
there
was
a
lady
here
last
night
who
according
to
your
changed
her
mind
about
staying
and
set
off
in
a
about
midnight
observed
allerdyke
which
is
she
now
in
this
lot
the
clerk
instantly
pointed
to
an
entry
made
in
a
big
dashing
handwriting
that
he
answered
miss
celia
lennard
number
two
numbers
away
from
james
allerdyke
room
number
the
inquirer
pricked
his
ears
it
was
she
who
went
off
in
the
middle
of
the
night
continued
the
clerk
she
pestered
me
with
a
lot
of
questions
as
to
how
she
could
get
north
to
edinburgh
that
would
be
about
eleven
i
told
her
she
could
get
a
train
until
morning
i
saw
her
going
upstairs
just
before
i
went
off
duty
soon
after
eleven
it
seems
according
to
the
i
know
he
told
me
said
allerdyke
interrupting
him
he
got
her
a
car
she
wanted
to
be
driven
to
some
station
on
the
great
northern
main
line
i
met
her
on
the
road
at
i
suppose
the
driver
of
that
car
can
be
found
he
have
returned
by
this
i
should
think
oh
you
can
find
him
all
right
answered
the
clerk
the
car
was
got
from
a
garage
close
by
allerdyke
jotted
down
the
name
of
the
garage
in
his
and
proceeded
to
make
further
inquiries
about
his
cousin
movements
on
the
previous
night
he
interviewed
various
hotel
servants
waiters
chambermaids
porters
all
could
tell
him
something
and
the
sum
total
of
what
they
could
tell
amounted
for
all
practical
purposes
to
next
to
nothing
james
allerdyke
had
come
to
the
hotel
just
as
several
other
people
had
come
he
had
been
served
with
a
light
supper
in
the
he
had
been
seen
chatting
with
one
or
two
people
in
the
lounge
and
in
the
a
chambermaid
had
seen
him
in
his
own
room
according
to
all
these
people
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
or
his
behaviour
that
was
out
of
the
common
and
all
agreed
that
he
looked
very
well
the
manager
who
accompanied
allerdyke
in
his
round
of
these
inquiries
glanced
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
when
they
came
to
an
end
of
course
sir
if
you
would
like
the
police
to
be
summoned
he
suggested
for
the
second
time
perhaps
no
not
yet
answered
allerdyke
i
daresay
they
have
to
be
called
in
indeed
i
suppose
it
absolutely
necessary
because
of
the
inquest
but
i
wait
until
i
hear
what
these
doctors
have
to
say
and
besides
that
i
want
to
get
some
news
from
london
it
a
queer
business
altogether
and
if
there
has
been
any
foul
play
why
he
paused
and
looked
round
at
the
people
who
were
passing
in
and
out
of
the
hall
in
a
corner
of
which
he
and
the
manager
were
standing
we
ca
hold
up
all
these
folk
and
ask
if
they
know
anything
you
know
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
that
the
devil
of
it
if
there
has
as
i
say
been
aught
wrong
murder
to
put
it
plainly
why
the
criminal
or
criminals
may
already
be
off
or
going
off
now
amongst
these
people
and
i
stop
them
in
a
few
hours
they
may
be
where
nobody
can
find
them
do
you
see
the
manager
did
see
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
helplessness
again
he
could
only
suggest
expert
help
from
the
police
but
this
time
he
added
to
his
suggestion
the
remark
that
he
understood
there
was
nothing
for
the
police
to
take
hold
of
no
clue
no
signs
of
foul
play
not
yet
agreed
allerdyke
but
there
may
be
well
i
afraid
that
register
is
no
good
it
meaningless
a
list
of
names
conveys
nothing
except
for
future
reference
for
the
present
we
must
wait
but
in
any
way
you
can
keep
your
eyes
open
there
one
thing
you
can
do
there
was
a
lady
in
here
last
night
who
took
room
and
left
it
at
midnight
to
go
away
in
a
which
your
got
for
her
i
particularly
want
to
see
the
chambermaid
who
attended
that
lady
let
me
see
her
privately
i
a
question
to
ask
her
she
shall
be
sent
up
to
your
as
soon
as
i
found
her
responded
the
manager
this
is
the
servants
but
send
her
up
there
after
nine
said
allerdyke
in
the
meantime
i
another
inquiry
to
make
elsewhere
he
found
gaffney
and
sent
him
round
to
the
garage
from
which
miss
celia
lennard
had
obtained
her
midnight
car
with
instructions
to
find
the
chauffeur
who
had
driven
her
and
to
get
from
him
what
information
he
could
as
to
her
movements
subsequent
to
the
rencontre
at
howden
do
excite
his
suspicions
said
allerdyke
but
pump
him
for
any
news
he
can
give
you
i
want
to
know
what
became
of
her
gaffney
speedily
returned
fully
informed
of
miss
lennard
movements
up
to
a
certain
point
the
chauffeur
had
just
got
back
and
was
about
to
seek
the
bed
from
which
he
had
been
pulled
at
one
in
the
morning
he
had
taken
the
lady
to
york
only
to
find
that
there
was
no
train
thence
to
edinburgh
until
after
nine
so
she
had
turned
into
the
station
hotel
at
york
to
wait
and
there
he
had
left
her
there
was
little
of
importance
in
this
but
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
miss
lennard
was
certainly
about
to
travel
north
and
that
her
hurried
departure
from
the
hotel
was
due
to
a
genuine
desire
to
reach
her
ultimate
destination
as
speedily
as
possible
while
allerdyke
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
worth
while
to
follow
her
up
merely
because
she
had
been
a
with
his
cousin
the
manager
came
to
him
with
another
telegram
that
lady
we
were
talking
about
he
said
laying
the
telegram
before
allerdyke
has
just
sent
me
this
i
thought
you
like
to
see
it
as
you
were
asking
about
her
allerdyke
saw
that
the
message
was
addressed
to
the
manager
and
had
been
dispatched
from
york
railway
station
of
a
hour
previously
please
ask
chambermaid
to
search
for
diamond
which
i
believe
i
lost
in
your
hotel
last
night
if
found
send
by
registered
post
to
miss
lennard
bedford
court
mansions
london
allerdyke
memorized
that
address
while
he
secretly
wondered
whether
he
should
or
should
not
tell
the
manager
that
the
missing
property
was
in
his
possession
finally
he
determined
to
keep
silence
for
the
moment
and
he
handed
back
the
message
with
an
assumption
of
indifference
i
should
think
a
thing
of
that
sort
will
soon
be
found
he
observed
look
here
never
mind
about
sending
that
chambermaid
to
me
just
now
i
see
her
later
i
going
to
breakfast
he
wondered
as
he
sat
in
the
eating
and
drinking
if
any
of
the
folk
about
him
knew
anything
about
the
dead
man
whose
body
had
been
quietly
taken
away
by
the
doctors
while
the
hotel
routine
went
on
in
its
usual
fashion
it
seemed
odd
strange
almost
weird
to
think
that
any
one
of
these
people
eating
fish
or
chops
chatting
reading
their
newspapers
might
be
in
possession
of
some
knowledge
which
he
would
give
a
good
deal
to
appropriate
of
one
fact
however
he
was
certain
that
diamond
buckle
belonged
to
miss
celia
lennard
and
she
lived
at
an
address
in
london
which
he
had
by
that
time
written
down
in
his
and
now
arose
the
big
and
in
view
of
what
had
happened
the
most
important
and
serious
question
how
had
miss
celia
lennard
diamond
buckle
come
to
be
in
room
number
that
question
had
got
to
be
answered
and
he
foresaw
that
he
and
miss
lennard
must
very
quickly
meet
again
but
there
were
many
matters
to
be
dealt
with
first
and
they
began
to
arise
and
to
demand
attention
at
once
before
he
had
finished
breakfast
came
a
wire
from
franklin
fullaway
answering
his
own
deeply
grieved
and
astonished
by
your
news
am
coming
down
at
once
and
shall
arrive
hull
two
in
meantime
keep
strict
guard
on
your
cousin
effects
especially
on
any
sealed
package
most
important
this
should
be
done
this
message
only
added
to
the
mass
of
mystery
which
had
been
thickening
ever
since
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
strict
guard
on
effects
any
sealed
package
what
did
that
mean
but
a
very
little
reflection
made
allerdyke
come
to
the
conclusion
that
all
these
vague
references
and
hints
bore
relation
to
the
possible
transaction
mentioned
in
the
various
telegrams
already
exchanged
between
james
allerdyke
and
franklin
fullaway
and
that
james
had
on
him
or
in
his
possession
when
he
left
russia
something
which
was
certainly
not
discovered
when
gaffney
searched
the
dead
man
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
to
wait
for
two
things
the
result
of
the
medical
investigation
and
the
arrival
of
franklin
fullaway
the
second
came
first
at
ten
minutes
past
two
a
bustling
american
strode
into
marshall
allerdyke
private
and
at
the
instant
that
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
asked
a
question
which
seemed
to
burst
from
every
fibre
of
his
being
my
dear
sir
are
they
safe
chapter
v
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
allerdyke
like
all
true
yorkshiremen
had
been
born
into
the
world
with
a
double
portion
of
caution
and
a
triple
one
of
reserve
and
instead
of
answering
the
question
he
took
a
leisurely
look
at
the
questioner
he
saw
before
him
a
tall
irreproachably
attired
man
of
from
thirty
to
years
of
age
whose
dark
eyes
were
ablaze
with
excitement
whose
equally
dark
carefully
trimmed
moustache
did
not
conceal
the
agitation
of
the
lips
beneath
franklin
fullaway
in
spite
of
his
broad
shoulders
and
excellent
muscular
development
was
evidently
a
highly
strung
nervous
sensitive
gentleman
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
he
had
travelled
from
town
in
a
state
of
great
mental
activity
which
was
just
arriving
at
everything
about
his
movements
and
gestures
denoted
it
the
way
in
which
he
removed
his
hat
laid
aside
his
stick
and
gloves
ran
his
fingers
through
his
dark
curly
hair
and
more
than
anything
looked
at
marshall
allerdyke
but
allerdyke
had
a
habit
of
becoming
cool
and
quiet
when
other
men
grew
excited
and
emotional
and
he
glanced
at
his
visitor
with
seeming
indifference
fullaway
i
suppose
he
said
phlegmatically
aye
to
be
sure
sit
you
down
fullaway
will
you
take
anything
it
a
longish
ride
from
london
and
i
daresay
you
do
with
a
drink
what
nothing
nothing
thank
you
allerdyke
answered
fullaway
obviously
surprised
by
the
other
coolness
i
had
lunch
on
the
train
very
convenient
that
observed
allerdyke
i
can
remember
when
there
was
a
chance
of
it
aye
and
what
might
this
be
that
you
asking
about
now
fullaway
what
do
you
refer
to
fullaway
after
a
moment
surprised
look
at
the
yorkshireman
stolid
face
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
shook
his
head
then
he
edged
his
chair
nearer
to
the
table
at
which
allerdyke
sat
you
do
know
then
that
your
cousin
had
valuables
on
him
he
asked
in
an
altered
tone
i
know
exactly
what
my
cousin
had
on
him
and
what
was
in
his
baggage
when
i
found
him
dead
in
his
room
replied
allerdyke
drily
and
what
that
was
was
just
what
i
should
have
expected
to
find
but
nothing
more
fullaway
almost
leapt
in
his
chair
nothing
more
he
exclaimed
nothing
more
than
you
would
have
expected
to
find
nothing
allerdyke
bent
across
the
table
giving
his
visitor
a
keen
look
what
would
you
have
expected
to
find
if
you
found
him
as
i
found
him
he
asked
come
what
now
he
was
watching
the
american
narrowly
and
he
saw
that
excitement
was
passing
off
was
being
changed
into
an
attentive
eagerness
he
himself
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
out
the
papers
which
had
been
accumulating
there
since
his
arrival
and
discovery
we
best
be
plain
fullaway
he
said
i
do
know
you
but
i
gather
that
you
knew
james
and
that
you
done
business
together
i
knew
james
allerdyke
very
well
and
i
done
business
with
him
for
the
last
two
years
replied
fullaway
just
so
assented
allerdyke
and
your
business
that
of
a
general
agent
an
intermediary
if
you
like
answered
fullaway
i
arrange
private
sales
a
good
deal
between
european
sellers
and
american
buyers
pictures
curiosities
jewels
antiques
and
so
on
i
pretty
well
known
allerdyke
on
both
sides
the
atlantic
quite
so
said
allerdyke
i
not
in
that
line
however
and
i
know
you
but
i
tell
you
all
i
do
know
and
you
tell
me
all
you
know
when
i
searched
my
cousin
for
papers
i
found
this
wire
from
you
sent
to
james
at
petersburg
now
then
what
does
it
refer
to
those
valuables
you
hinted
at
just
now
exactly
answered
fullaway
nothing
less
what
valuables
are
they
asked
allerdyke
jewels
worth
a
quarter
of
a
million
replied
fullaway
what
dollars
fullaway
laughed
derisively
dollars
no
pounds
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
my
dear
sir
he
answered
you
think
he
had
them
on
him
i
sure
he
had
them
on
him
asserted
fullaway
he
in
his
turn
began
to
produce
papers
at
any
rate
he
had
them
on
him
when
he
was
in
christiania
the
other
day
he
was
bringing
them
over
here
to
me
on
whose
behalf
asked
allerdyke
on
behalf
of
a
russian
lady
a
princess
who
wished
to
find
a
purchaser
for
them
replied
the
american
promptly
in
that
case
to
come
to
the
point
said
allerdyke
if
my
cousin
james
had
that
property
on
him
when
he
landed
here
last
night
and
it
was
as
it
certainly
was
on
him
when
i
found
him
this
morning
been
robbed
robbed
and
murdered
that
he
might
be
robbed
answered
fullaway
the
two
men
looked
steadily
at
each
other
for
a
while
then
allerdyke
laid
his
papers
on
the
table
between
them
you
better
tell
me
all
you
know
about
it
he
said
quietly
hear
it
all
then
we
shall
be
getting
towards
knowing
what
to
do
willingly
exclaimed
the
american
he
produced
and
spread
out
a
couple
of
cablegrams
on
which
he
laid
a
hand
while
he
talked
as
i
have
already
said
i
have
had
several
deals
in
business
with
james
allerdyke
i
last
saw
him
towards
the
end
of
march
in
town
and
he
then
mentioned
to
me
that
he
was
just
about
setting
out
for
russia
on
april
i
received
this
cable
from
him
sent
you
see
from
petersburg
allow
me
to
read
it
to
you
he
says
princess
nastirsevitch
is
anxious
to
find
purchaser
for
her
jewels
valued
more
than
once
at
about
a
quarter
of
million
pounds
wants
money
to
clear
off
mortgages
on
her
estate
and
set
him
going
again
do
you
know
of
any
one
likely
to
buy
in
one
lot
can
arrange
to
bring
over
myself
for
buyers
inspection
if
chance
of
immediate
good
sale
james
allerdyke
now
as
soon
as
i
received
that
from
your
cousin
i
immediately
thought
of
a
possible
and
very
likely
purchaser
delkin
a
chicago
man
whose
only
daughter
is
just
about
to
marry
an
english
nobleman
i
knew
that
delkin
had
a
mind
to
give
his
daughter
a
really
fine
collection
of
jewels
and
i
went
at
once
to
him
regarding
the
matter
in
consequence
of
my
interview
with
delkin
i
cabled
to
james
allerdyke
on
april
saying
this
is
it
no
doubt
said
allerdyke
producing
the
message
of
the
date
mentioned
that
is
it
assented
fullaway
glancing
across
the
table
very
well
you
see
what
i
said
he
replied
to
that
at
once
here
is
his
reply
it
is
you
see
very
brief
it
merely
says
right
shall
wire
details
later
keep
possible
buyer
on
i
heard
no
more
until
last
thursday
may
when
i
received
this
cablegram
sent
you
see
from
christiania
in
it
he
says
reach
hull
monday
night
next
shall
come
london
next
day
arrange
meeting
with
your
man
have
got
all
goods
now
those
last
four
words
allerdyke
if
they
mean
anything
at
all
mean
that
your
cousin
was
bringing
these
valuable
jewels
with
him
had
them
on
him
when
he
cabled
from
christiania
and
if
you
did
not
find
them
when
you
searched
him
where
are
they
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
worth
allerdyke
took
the
three
cablegrams
from
his
visitor
and
carefully
read
them
through
comparing
them
with
the
dates
already
known
to
him
and
with
fullaway
messages
in
reply
eventually
he
put
all
the
papers
together
arranging
them
in
sequence
he
laid
them
on
the
table
between
fullaway
and
himself
and
for
a
moment
or
two
sat
reflectively
drumming
the
tips
of
his
fingers
on
them
who
is
this
princess
nastirsevitch
he
asked
suddenly
looking
up
royalty
eh
no
answered
fullaway
with
a
smile
i
do
know
much
about
these
european
titles
and
dignities
but
i
do
think
the
title
of
prince
means
in
russia
what
it
does
in
england
a
prince
there
i
think
is
some
sort
of
nobleman
like
your
dukes
and
earls
and
so
on
here
but
anyway
the
princess
nastirsevitch
is
a
russian
at
all
except
by
marriage
she
a
countryman
of
my
own
i
guess
you
heard
of
her
she
was
helen
hamilton
the
famous
dancer
allerdyke
shook
his
head
not
my
line
at
all
he
said
it
was
a
bit
in
james
though
dancer
eh
and
married
a
prince
years
ago
replied
fullaway
ancient
history
that
but
i
know
a
good
deal
about
her
she
made
a
big
fortune
with
her
dancing
and
she
invested
largely
in
pearls
and
diamonds
i
know
that
i
also
happen
to
know
that
she
one
son
by
her
marriage
of
whom
she
passionately
fond
and
i
read
this
thing
in
this
way
i
guess
the
old
prince
estates
he
dead
a
year
or
two
ago
were
heavily
mortgaged
and
she
hit
on
the
notion
of
clearing
all
off
by
selling
her
jewels
so
that
her
son
might
start
clear
no
encumbrances
on
the
property
you
know
allerdyke
pursed
his
lips
and
rubbed
his
chin
what
i
do
understand
is
that
she
confided
a
quarter
of
a
worth
of
goods
of
that
sort
to
a
man
whom
she
could
know
so
very
well
he
observed
i
never
heard
james
speak
of
her
that
may
be
replied
fullaway
but
he
may
have
known
her
very
well
for
all
that
however
there
are
the
facts
and
he
added
with
emphasis
there
allerdyke
are
those
four
words
sent
from
christiania
got
all
goods
now
we
can
be
reasonably
sure
of
what
he
meant
got
the
princess
jewels
very
well
where
are
they
allerdyke
got
to
his
feet
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
to
stride
about
the
room
all
this
was
not
merely
puzzling
but
in
a
way
which
he
could
not
understand
distasteful
to
him
somehow
he
did
not
know
why
nor
at
that
moment
try
to
think
why
he
resented
the
fact
that
any
one
knew
more
about
his
dead
cousin
than
he
did
and
he
began
to
wonder
as
he
strode
about
the
room
how
much
this
franklin
fullaway
knew
did
my
cousin
james
ever
mention
this
princess
to
you
he
suddenly
asked
stopping
in
his
walk
to
and
fro
i
mean
before
he
went
over
to
russia
this
last
time
he
just
mentioned
that
he
knew
her
mentioned
it
in
casual
conversation
answered
fullaway
she
and
i
being
fellow
americans
the
subject
interested
me
of
course
but
he
only
said
that
he
had
met
her
in
russia
aye
well
said
allerdyke
musingly
it
true
he
did
go
across
to
russia
a
good
deal
and
no
doubt
he
knew
folk
there
that
he
never
told
me
about
well
he
went
on
throwing
himself
into
his
chair
again
to
be
done
do
you
honestly
think
that
he
had
those
things
on
him
when
he
came
here
last
night
you
do
very
well
then
he
been
murdered
by
some
devil
or
devils
who
got
but
how
and
who
are
they
or
he
or
good
lord
it
might
be
who
she
poisoned
said
fullaway
that
my
answer
to
your
question
of
how
as
to
your
other
question
is
there
no
clue
to
anything
you
forget
i
know
any
details
i
only
know
that
he
was
found
dead
under
what
circumstances
allerdyke
pulled
his
chair
nearer
to
his
visitor
i
forgotten
he
said
i
tell
you
the
lot
see
if
you
can
make
aught
out
of
it
they
always
say
you
yankees
have
sharp
brains
try
to
see
a
bit
of
daylight
so
far
it
licks
me
he
gave
the
american
a
brief
yet
full
account
of
all
that
had
happened
since
his
receipt
of
james
allerdyke
wireless
message
and
fullaway
listened
in
silence
taking
everything
in
making
no
interruption
and
at
the
end
he
spoke
quietly
and
with
decision
we
must
find
that
woman
miss
celia
lennard
and
at
once
he
said
that
absolutely
necessary
just
so
agreed
allerdyke
but
look
here
i
been
thinking
that
over
is
it
very
likely
that
a
woman
who
stolen
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
stuff
from
an
hotel
would
wire
back
to
its
manager
giving
her
address
for
the
sake
of
a
even
one
set
with
diamonds
i
not
for
the
moment
supposing
that
she
is
the
thief
answered
fullaway
why
i
want
and
must
find
her
at
once
is
to
ask
her
a
simple
question
what
was
she
doing
in
james
allerdyke
room
for
i
an
idea
what
demanded
allerdyke
this
replied
fullaway
they
were
on
the
your
cousin
as
i
daresay
you
know
was
the
sort
of
man
who
readily
makes
friends
especially
with
women
my
idea
is
that
if
this
miss
lennard
went
into
his
room
last
night
it
was
to
be
shown
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
your
cousin
was
just
the
sort
of
man
who
knew
how
a
woman
would
appreciate
an
exhibition
of
such
things
and
at
that
moment
a
waiter
tapped
at
the
door
and
announced
orwin
chapter
vi
the
prima
donna
portrait
marshall
allerdyke
sharp
eyes
were
quick
to
see
that
his
new
visitor
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
and
wished
to
give
his
news
in
private
orwin
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
american
as
he
took
the
seat
which
allerdyke
drew
forward
and
the
cock
of
his
eyes
indicated
a
strong
desire
to
know
who
the
stranger
was
friend
of
my
late
cousin
said
allerdyke
brusquely
franklin
fullaway
of
london
just
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
hear
what
you
have
to
tell
us
doctor
you
come
to
tell
something
of
course
the
doctor
inclined
his
head
towards
fullaway
and
added
a
grave
bow
in
answer
to
allerdyke
question
the
autopsy
has
been
made
he
replied
by
lydenberg
quillet
who
is
one
of
the
here
and
myself
we
made
a
very
careful
and
particular
examination
and
the
result
asked
allerdyke
eagerly
is
it
what
you
anticipated
from
your
first
glance
at
him
here
the
doctor
face
became
a
shade
graver
his
voice
assumed
an
oracular
tone
my
two
colleagues
he
said
agreed
that
your
cousin
death
resulted
from
heart
failure
which
arose
from
what
we
may
call
ordinary
causes
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
into
details
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
say
that
they
are
abundantly
justified
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
at
which
they
have
arrived
it
is
quite
certain
that
your
cousin
heart
had
recently
become
seriously
affected
but
as
regards
myself
here
he
paused
and
looking
narrowly
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
two
hearers
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
lower
more
confidential
tone
as
regards
myself
i
am
not
quite
so
certain
as
lydenberg
and
quillet
appear
to
be
the
fact
of
the
case
is
i
think
it
very
possible
that
james
allerdyke
was
poisoned
neither
of
the
two
who
listened
so
intently
made
any
reply
to
this
significant
announcement
instead
they
kept
their
eyes
intently
fixed
on
the
doctor
grave
face
then
they
slowly
turned
from
him
to
each
other
exchanging
glances
and
after
a
pause
the
doctor
went
on
speaking
in
measured
and
solemn
accents
there
is
no
need
either
at
present
only
at
present
that
i
should
tell
you
why
i
think
that
he
continued
i
may
be
wrong
my
two
colleagues
are
inclined
to
think
i
am
wrong
but
they
quite
agree
with
me
that
it
will
be
proper
to
preserve
certain
organs
you
understand
for
further
examination
by
say
the
home
office
analyst
who
is
always
of
course
a
famous
pathological
expert
that
will
be
done
in
fact
we
have
already
sealed
up
what
we
wish
to
be
further
examined
but
he
paused
again
shaking
his
head
more
solemnly
than
ever
the
truth
is
gentlemen
he
went
on
at
last
i
am
doubtful
if
even
that
analysis
and
examination
will
reveal
anything
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
call
them
mere
notions
theories
ideas
rather
than
suspicions
but
at
any
rate
if
there
is
anything
in
the
vague
thoughts
which
i
have
no
trace
of
any
poison
will
be
found
and
yet
your
cousin
may
have
been
poisoned
all
the
same
secretly
exclaimed
fullaway
orwin
gave
the
american
a
sharp
glance
which
indicated
that
he
realized
fullaway
understanding
of
what
he
had
just
said
precisely
he
answered
there
are
poisons
known
to
experts
which
will
destroy
life
almost
to
a
given
minute
and
of
which
the
most
skilful
pathologist
and
expert
will
not
be
able
to
find
a
single
trace
now
please
understand
my
position
i
say
it
is
quite
possible
quite
likely
quite
in
accordance
with
what
i
have
seen
that
this
unfortunate
gentleman
died
of
heart
failure
brought
about
by
even
such
an
ordinary
exertion
as
his
stooping
forward
to
untie
his
but
i
also
think
it
likely
that
his
death
resulted
from
poison
subtly
and
cunningly
administered
probably
not
very
long
before
his
death
took
place
and
if
i
only
knew
he
paused
at
that
and
looked
searchingly
and
meaningly
at
marshall
allerdyke
before
he
continued
and
allerdyke
looked
back
with
the
same
intentness
and
nodded
yes
yes
he
said
if
you
only
knew
say
it
doctor
if
i
only
knew
if
there
was
any
reason
why
any
person
wished
to
take
this
man
life
responded
orwin
slowly
and
deliberately
if
i
knew
that
somebody
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
for
instance
allerdyke
jumped
to
his
feet
and
tapped
fullaway
on
the
shoulder
come
in
here
a
minute
he
said
motioning
towards
the
door
of
his
bedroom
excuse
us
doctor
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
this
gentleman
look
here
he
continued
when
he
had
led
the
american
into
the
bedroom
and
had
closed
the
door
you
hear
what
he
says
shall
we
tell
him
or
shall
we
keep
it
all
dark
for
a
while
which
what
tell
him
under
promise
of
secrecy
replied
fullaway
after
a
consideration
medical
men
are
all
right
yes
tell
him
he
may
suggest
something
and
i
inclined
to
think
his
theory
is
correct
eh
correct
exclaimed
allerdyke
with
a
grim
laugh
you
bet
it
correct
come
on
then
we
tell
him
all
now
doctor
he
went
on
leading
the
way
back
into
the
we
going
to
give
you
our
confidence
you
treat
it
as
a
strict
confidence
a
secret
between
us
for
the
present
the
truth
is
that
when
my
cousin
came
to
this
hotel
last
night
he
was
in
possession
that
is
we
have
the
very
strongest
grounds
for
believing
him
to
have
been
in
possession
of
certain
extremely
valuable
property
worth
a
large
amount
which
he
was
carrying
safeguarding
from
a
lady
in
russia
to
this
gentleman
in
london
when
i
searched
his
body
and
luggage
these
valuables
were
missing
fullaway
and
myself
have
the
least
doubt
that
he
was
robbed
so
your
theory
eh
orwin
had
listened
to
this
with
deep
attention
and
he
now
put
two
quick
questions
the
value
of
these
things
was
great
relatively
very
great
answered
allerdyke
enough
to
engage
the
attention
of
a
clever
gang
of
thieves
quite
then
said
the
doctor
i
am
quite
of
opinion
that
my
ideas
are
correct
these
people
probably
tracked
your
cousin
to
this
place
contrived
to
administer
a
subtle
and
deadly
poison
to
him
last
night
and
entered
his
room
after
the
time
at
which
they
knew
it
would
take
effect
have
you
any
clue
even
a
slight
one
only
this
answered
allerdyke
and
proceeded
to
narrate
the
story
of
the
adding
fullaway
theory
to
it
that
not
much
eh
you
must
find
that
woman
and
produce
her
at
the
inquest
said
the
doctor
i
take
it
that
fullaway
idea
is
a
correct
one
your
cousin
probably
did
invite
miss
lennard
into
his
room
to
show
her
these
jewels
that
of
course
would
prove
that
he
had
them
in
his
possession
at
some
certain
hour
last
night
now
about
that
inquest
it
is
fixed
for
ten
morning
let
me
advise
you
as
to
your
own
course
of
procedure
having
an
eye
on
what
you
have
told
me
your
object
should
be
to
make
the
proceedings
merely
formal
so
that
the
coroner
can
issue
his
order
for
interment
and
then
adjourn
for
further
evidence
it
will
be
sufficient
if
you
give
evidence
identifying
the
body
if
evidence
is
given
of
the
autopsy
and
an
adjournment
asked
for
until
a
further
examination
of
the
reserved
organs
and
viscera
can
be
made
for
the
present
i
should
keep
back
the
matter
of
the
supposed
robbery
until
you
can
find
this
miss
lennard
at
the
adjourned
inquest
say
in
a
week
or
ten
days
hence
everything
pertinent
can
be
brought
out
but
you
will
need
legal
help
i
am
rather
trespassing
on
legal
preserves
in
telling
you
so
much
deeply
obliged
to
you
doctor
and
you
can
add
to
our
obigations
by
giving
us
the
name
of
a
good
man
to
go
to
said
allerdyke
we
see
him
at
once
and
fix
things
up
for
morning
orwin
wrote
down
the
name
and
address
of
a
solicitor
and
presently
went
away
when
he
had
gone
allerdyke
turned
to
fullaway
now
then
he
said
you
and
i
do
one
or
two
things
we
call
on
this
lawyer
then
we
cable
to
the
princess
but
how
shall
we
get
her
address
there
sure
to
be
a
russian
consul
in
the
town
suggested
fullaway
good
idea
and
i
going
to
telephone
to
this
miss
lennard
address
in
london
continued
allerdyke
she
evidently
set
off
from
here
to
edinburgh
but
anyway
the
address
she
gave
in
that
wire
to
the
manager
is
a
london
one
and
i
going
to
try
it
now
let
get
out
and
be
at
work
the
ensuing
conversation
between
these
two
and
a
deeply
interested
and
solicitor
resulted
in
the
dispatch
of
a
lengthy
cablegram
to
petersburg
a
conversation
over
the
telephone
with
the
housekeeper
of
miss
celia
lennard
london
flat
and
the
interviewing
of
the
captain
and
stewards
of
the
steamship
on
which
james
allerdyke
had
crossed
from
christiania
the
net
result
of
this
varied
inquiry
was
small
and
produced
little
that
could
throw
additional
light
on
the
matter
in
question
the
officials
had
not
seen
anything
suspicious
in
the
conduct
or
personality
of
any
of
their
passengers
they
had
observed
james
allerdyke
in
casual
conversation
with
some
of
them
they
had
seen
him
talking
to
miss
lennard
to
lydenberg
to
others
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
subsequently
put
up
at
the
station
hotel
for
the
night
nothing
that
they
could
tell
suggested
anything
out
of
the
common
miss
lennard
housekeeper
gave
no
other
information
than
that
her
mistress
was
at
present
in
edinburgh
and
was
expected
to
remain
there
for
at
least
a
week
and
towards
night
came
a
message
from
the
princess
nastirsevitch
confirming
fullaway
conviction
that
james
allerdyke
was
in
possession
of
her
jewels
and
announcing
that
she
was
leaving
for
england
at
once
and
should
travel
straight
via
berlin
and
calais
to
meet
franklin
fullaway
at
his
hotel
in
london
the
solicitor
agreed
with
orwin
suggestions
as
to
the
course
to
be
followed
with
regard
to
the
inquest
it
would
be
wise
he
said
to
keep
matters
quiet
for
at
any
rate
a
few
days
until
they
were
in
a
position
to
bring
forward
more
facts
consequently
the
few
people
who
were
present
at
the
coroner
court
next
morning
gained
no
idea
of
the
real
importance
of
the
inquiry
which
was
then
opened
even
the
solitary
reporter
who
took
a
perfunctory
note
of
the
proceedings
for
his
newspaper
gathered
no
more
from
what
he
heard
than
that
a
gentleman
had
died
suddenly
at
the
station
hotel
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
hold
an
inquest
that
there
was
some
little
doubt
as
to
the
precise
cause
of
his
death
and
that
the
inquest
was
accordingly
adjourned
until
the
medical
men
could
tell
something
of
a
more
definite
nature
nothing
sensational
crept
out
into
the
town
no
headlines
ornamented
the
afternoon
editions
an
hour
before
noon
marshall
allerdyke
entrusted
his
cousin
body
to
the
care
of
certain
kinsfolk
who
had
come
over
from
bradford
to
take
charge
of
it
by
noon
he
and
fullaway
were
slipping
out
of
hull
on
their
way
to
edinburgh
to
search
for
a
witness
who
if
and
when
they
found
her
might
be
able
to
tell
them
what
seems
something
like
a
chase
said
allerdyke
as
the
train
steamed
on
across
country
towards
york
and
the
north
how
do
we
know
where
to
find
this
woman
in
edinburgh
her
housekeeper
did
know
what
hotel
she
was
at
i
suppose
we
have
to
try
every
one
in
the
place
till
we
come
across
her
edinburgh
is
not
a
very
big
town
remarked
fullaway
i
reckon
to
run
her
down
if
she
still
there
within
a
couple
of
hours
it
our
first
duty
anyway
if
she
as
i
guess
she
did
saw
those
jewels
then
we
know
that
james
allerdyke
had
them
on
him
when
he
reached
hull
dead
sure
and
supposing
she
can
tell
that
said
allerdyke
what
then
how
does
that
help
the
devils
who
got
have
already
had
start
of
us
the
american
produced
a
bulky
found
a
green
cigar
and
lighted
it
with
a
deliberation
which
was
in
marked
contrast
to
his
usual
nervous
movements
seems
to
me
he
said
presently
seems
very
much
to
me
that
this
has
been
a
great
thing
i
figure
it
out
like
this
somehow
somebody
has
got
to
know
of
what
the
princess
and
your
cousin
were
up
to
that
he
was
going
to
carry
those
valuable
jewels
with
him
to
england
he
must
have
been
tracked
all
the
way
unless
does
any
unless
strike
you
now
not
at
the
moment
replied
allerdyke
so
unless
what
unless
the
thieves
and
murderers
were
waiting
there
in
hull
for
his
arrival
said
fullaway
quietly
that
possible
strikes
me
a
good
many
possibilities
are
knocking
around
remarked
allerdyke
with
more
than
his
usual
dryness
as
for
me
i
want
to
know
a
lot
about
these
valuables
and
their
consignment
before
i
make
up
my
mind
in
any
way
i
tell
you
frankly
i
not
running
after
them
wanting
to
find
the
folk
who
killed
my
cousin
and
i
only
hope
this
young
woman
be
able
to
give
me
a
hand
and
the
sooner
we
get
to
the
bottle
of
hay
and
begin
prospecting
for
the
needle
the
better
but
the
search
for
miss
celia
lennard
to
which
allerdyke
alluded
so
gloomily
was
not
destined
to
be
either
difficult
or
lengthy
as
he
and
his
companion
walked
along
one
of
the
platforms
in
the
waverley
station
in
edinburgh
that
evening
on
their
way
to
a
cab
allerdyke
suddenly
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
seized
the
american
by
the
elbow
twisting
him
round
in
front
of
a
big
poster
which
displayed
the
portrait
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
good
lord
he
exclaimed
there
she
is
see
that
the
woman
man
alive
we
hit
it
at
once
look
fullaway
turned
and
stared
not
so
much
at
the
portrait
as
at
the
big
lettering
above
and
beneath
it
zélie
de
longarde
the
soprano
recently
returned
from
moscow
and
petersburg
only
visit
to
edinburgh
this
year
at
chapter
vii
the
frantic
impresario
fullaway
slowly
read
this
announcement
aloud
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
it
he
laughed
so
your
mysterious
lady
of
the
midnight
motor
your
miss
celia
lennard
of
the
hull
hotel
is
the
great
and
only
zélie
de
longarde
eh
he
said
well
i
guess
that
makes
matters
a
lot
easier
and
clearer
but
sure
it
is
a
case
of
striking
resemblance
i
only
saw
that
woman
for
a
minute
or
two
by
moonlight
when
she
stuck
her
face
out
of
her
car
to
ask
the
way
replied
allerdyke
but
lay
all
i
worth
to
a
that
the
woman
i
then
saw
is
the
woman
whose
picture
we
staring
at
great
scott
so
she
a
famous
singer
is
she
you
know
of
her
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
not
in
my
line
never
was
i
do
go
to
a
concert
or
a
musical
party
once
in
five
years
oh
she
great
sure
responded
fullaway
beautiful
voice
divine
and
as
i
say
things
are
going
to
be
easy
i
met
this
lady
more
than
once
though
i
did
know
that
she
any
other
name
than
that
which
is
presumably
her
professional
one
and
i
also
had
one
or
two
business
deals
with
her
so
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
find
out
which
hotel
stopping
at
in
this
city
and
then
we
go
round
there
and
i
send
in
my
card
but
i
say
do
you
see
this
affair
this
very
evening
and
at
eight
and
it
past
seven
now
she
be
arraying
herself
for
the
platform
we
better
wait
until
allerdyke
practical
mind
asserted
itself
he
twisted
the
american
round
in
another
direction
and
called
to
a
porter
who
had
picked
up
their
bags
all
that
easy
he
said
we
stick
these
things
in
the
spot
dine
here
in
the
station
and
go
straight
to
the
concert
there
perhaps
during
an
interval
we
might
get
in
a
word
with
this
lady
who
sports
two
names
come
on
now
he
hurried
his
companion
from
the
to
the
gave
a
quick
order
on
his
own
behalf
to
the
waiter
left
fullaway
to
give
his
own
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
vigour
of
a
man
who
means
to
waste
no
time
there
one
thing
jolly
certain
my
lad
he
said
presently
leaning
confidentially
across
the
table
after
he
had
munched
in
silence
for
a
while
this
miss
lennard
or
mamselle
or
signora
de
longarde
or
whatever
her
real
label
is
has
got
those
jewels
confound
folks
who
steal
things
like
that
do
behave
as
she
doing
i
never
thought
she
had
stolen
the
jewels
answered
fullaway
what
i
want
to
know
is
has
she
seen
them
and
when
and
where
and
under
what
circumstances
you
got
her
all
safe
just
now
replied
allerdyke
laconically
that
be
an
extra
passport
observed
fullaway
not
that
it
needed
because
as
i
said
i
done
business
for
her
oddly
enough
that
was
in
the
jewel
line
i
negotiated
the
sale
of
pinkie
pell
famous
pearl
necklace
with
mademoiselle
de
longarde
you
heard
of
that
of
course
never
a
whisper
answered
allerdyke
not
in
my
line
those
affairs
who
was
pinkie
pell
anyhow
pinkie
pell
was
a
artiste
my
dear
sir
once
a
great
favourite
who
came
down
in
the
world
and
had
to
sell
her
valuables
replied
the
american
to
the
last
she
stuck
to
a
pearl
necklace
which
was
said
to
have
been
given
to
her
by
the
duke
of
bendlecombe
pinkie
they
said
attached
a
sentimental
value
to
it
however
it
had
to
be
sold
and
i
sold
it
for
pinkie
to
the
lady
going
to
see
seven
thousand
five
hundred
it
well
worth
ten
mademoiselle
will
be
wearing
it
no
doubt
she
generally
does
anyway
so
you
see
it
not
unless
we
get
a
front
pew
said
allerdyke
hurry
up
and
let
be
off
our
best
plan
he
went
on
as
they
made
for
a
cab
will
be
to
get
as
near
the
platform
as
possible
so
that
i
can
make
certain
sure
this
is
the
woman
i
saw
at
howden
yesterday
morning
when
i
positively
identify
her
i
leave
it
to
you
to
work
the
interview
with
her
either
at
this
concert
place
or
at
her
hotel
afterwards
if
it
can
be
done
at
once
all
the
more
to
my
taste
i
want
to
be
knowing
things
oh
we
going
well
ahead
said
fullaway
i
work
it
all
right
i
noticed
on
that
poster
that
this
affair
is
being
run
by
the
ernest
weiss
i
know
weiss
he
get
us
an
interview
with
the
great
lady
after
she
appeared
the
first
time
it
a
fortunate
thing
for
me
to
have
a
man
who
seems
to
know
everybody
remarked
allerdyke
i
suppose
it
living
in
london
gives
you
so
much
acquaintance
it
my
business
to
know
a
lot
of
people
answered
fullaway
the
more
the
better
for
my
purposes
i
tell
you
how
i
came
to
know
your
cousin
later
that
rather
interesting
well
here
the
place
and
it
five
to
eight
now
we
struck
it
very
well
and
the
only
trouble
be
about
getting
good
seats
especially
as
we
in
morning
dress
allerdyke
smiled
at
that
in
his
opinion
money
would
carry
a
man
anywhere
and
there
was
always
plenty
of
that
useful
commodity
in
his
pockets
he
insisted
on
buying
the
seats
himself
and
after
some
parleying
and
explaining
at
the
he
and
his
companion
were
duly
escorted
to
seats
immediately
in
front
of
a
platform
where
they
were
set
down
amidst
a
highly
select
company
of
correctly
attired
folk
who
glanced
a
little
questioningly
at
their
tweed
suits
both
conspicuous
amidst
silks
satins
broadcloths
and
glazed
linen
allerdyke
laughed
as
he
thrust
a
program
into
fullaway
hand
i
worked
that
all
right
he
whispered
told
the
chap
in
that
receipt
of
custom
that
you
were
a
foreigner
of
great
distinction
travelling
incognito
in
scotland
and
i
your
travelling
companion
and
that
our
luggage
had
arrived
from
aberdeen
so
we
could
dress
but
we
must
hear
this
singing
lady
at
all
cost
and
in
any
case
then
i
slapped
down
the
brass
and
got
the
tickets
naught
like
brass
in
ready
form
my
lad
now
then
when
does
the
desired
party
appear
fullaway
unfolded
his
program
and
glanced
over
the
items
the
of
ernest
weiss
was
famous
for
the
fare
which
it
put
before
its
patrons
and
here
was
certainly
enough
variety
of
talent
to
please
the
most
critical
a
famous
tenor
a
popular
violinist
a
contralto
much
in
favour
for
her
singing
of
tender
and
sentimental
songs
a
notable
performer
on
the
violincello
a
local
vocalist
whose
speciality
was
the
singing
of
ancient
scottish
melodies
and
item
of
vast
interest
to
a
certain
section
of
the
audience
a
youthful
prodigy
who
was
fondly
believed
to
have
it
in
her
power
to
become
a
female
paderewski
these
performers
were
duly
announced
on
the
program
in
terms
of
varying
importance
outstanding
from
all
of
them
of
course
was
the
great
star
of
the
evening
the
one
and
only
zélie
de
longarde
acknowledged
queen
of
song
in
milan
and
moscow
paris
and
london
new
york
and
melbourne
comes
on
fifth
i
see
observed
allerdyke
glancing
over
his
program
unconcernedly
well
i
suppose
we
got
to
stick
out
the
other
four
i
not
great
on
music
fullaway
do
know
one
tune
from
another
however
i
reckon
i
can
stand
a
bit
of
noise
until
my
lady
shows
herself
he
listened
with
interest
which
was
not
far
removed
from
indifference
to
the
contralto
the
the
violinist
only
waking
up
to
something
like
enthusiasm
when
the
infant
prodigy
a
quaint
painfully
shy
little
creature
who
bobbed
a
side
curtsey
at
the
audience
and
looked
much
too
small
to
tackle
the
grand
piano
appeared
and
proceeded
to
execute
wonderful
things
with
her
small
fingers
that
a
bit
of
all
right
murmured
allerdyke
when
the
child
had
finished
her
first
contribution
that
a
clever
little
party
but
too
big
in
the
eye
and
too
small
in
the
bone
wants
plenty
of
new
milk
and
eggs
and
fresh
air
and
not
so
much
does
that
clever
clever
but
unnatural
fullaway
they
must
let
her
do
too
much
at
that
well
now
i
suppose
we
shall
see
the
lady
the
packed
audience
evidently
supposed
the
same
thing
over
it
the
infant
prodigy
having
received
her
meed
of
applause
and
bobbed
herself
awkwardly
out
of
sight
had
come
that
atmosphere
of
expectancy
which
invariably
heralds
the
appearance
of
the
great
figure
on
any
similar
occasion
it
needed
no
special
intuition
on
allerdyke
part
to
know
that
all
these
people
were
itching
to
show
their
fondness
for
zélie
de
longarde
by
clapping
their
hands
waving
their
program
and
otherwise
manifesting
their
delight
at
once
more
seeing
a
prime
favourite
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
wing
of
the
platform
all
hands
were
ready
to
give
welcome
but
a
minute
passed
two
minutes
three
minutes
and
zélie
de
longarde
did
not
appear
another
minute
and
then
endeavouring
to
smile
bravely
and
reassuringly
and
not
succeeding
particularly
well
in
the
attempt
a
tall
elaborately
attired
carefully
man
unmistakably
german
blonde
heavy
suave
suddenly
walked
on
to
the
platform
and
did
obeisance
to
the
audience
weiss
whispered
fullaway
something
wrong
look
at
his
face
in
big
trouble
the
straightened
himself
from
that
bow
and
looked
at
the
faces
in
front
of
him
with
a
mute
appeal
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
i
have
to
entreat
the
high
favour
of
your
kind
indulgence
mademoiselle
de
longarde
is
not
yet
arrived
from
her
hotel
i
hope
i
think
she
is
now
on
her
way
in
the
meantime
i
propose
with
your
gracious
consent
to
continue
our
program
with
the
next
item
at
the
conclusion
of
which
i
hope
mademoiselle
will
appear
the
audience
was
sympathetic
the
audience
was
ready
to
be
placated
it
gave
cordial
hearing
and
warm
favour
to
the
singer
of
scottish
melodies
it
even
played
into
weiss
hands
by
according
the
local
singer
an
encore
but
when
he
had
finally
retired
there
was
another
wait
a
longer
one
which
lengthened
unduly
a
note
of
impatience
sounded
from
the
gallery
it
was
taken
up
elsewhere
and
suddenly
weiss
came
again
upon
the
platform
this
time
with
no
affectation
of
suave
entreaty
he
was
plainly
much
upset
his
elegant
waistcoat
seemed
to
have
assumed
careworn
creases
his
mop
of
blonde
hair
was
palpably
rumpled
as
if
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
tear
some
of
its
wavy
locks
out
by
force
and
when
he
spoke
his
fat
voice
shook
with
a
mixture
of
chagrin
and
anger
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
i
crave
ten
thousand
a
million
pardons
for
this
state
of
affairs

the
truth
is

de
longarde

fly
swift
to
the
hotel
to
entreat
mademoiselle
on
my
knees
to
return
with
me
in
the
meantime
as
weiss
retired
from
the
platform
and
the
longhaired
came
upon
it
fullaway
sprang
up
dragging
allerdyke
after
him
he
led
the
way
to
a
sidedoor
whispered
something
to
an
attendant
and
was
quickly
ushered
through
another
door
to
an
behind
the
wings
where
weiss
livid
with
anger
was
struggling
into
an
the
gasped
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
american
ah
my
dear
mr
fullaway
he
exclaimed
you
here

have
heard

have
been
in
front

will
not
come
to
sing
because
her

ah

with
you
said
fullaway
quick
now
allerdyke
got
some
vivid
impressions
during
the
next
few
minutes
impressions
various
startling
they
began
with
a
swift
whirl
through
the
lighted
streets
of
the
smoky
old
city
of
a
dash
upstairs
at
a
big
hotel
they
ended
with
a
picture
of
a
beautiful
highly
enraged
woman
who
was
freely
speaking
her
mind
to
a
dismayed
hotel
manager
and
a
couple
of
men
who
were
obviously
members
of
the
detective
force
chapter
viii
the
jewel
box
mademoiselle
zélie
de
longarde
utterly
careless
of
the
fact
that
her
toilette
was
but
half
complete
that
she
wore
no
gown
and
that
the
kimono
which
she
had
hastily
assumed
on
discovering
her
loss
had
slipped
away
from
her
graceful
figure
to
fall
in
folds
about
her
feet
interrupted
the
torrent
of
her
eloquence
to
stare
at
the
three
men
whom
a
startled
waiter
ushered
into
her
her
first
glance
fell
on
the
and
she
shook
her
fist
at
him
go
away
weiss
she
commanded
accompanying
the
vigorous
action
of
her
hand
with
an
equally
emphatic
stamp
of
a
shapely
foot
go
away
at
once
go
and
play
on
the
french
horn
go
and
do
anything
you
like
to
satisfy
your
audience
not
one
note
do
i
sing
until
somebody
finds
me
my
jewels
edinburgh

them
and
edinburgh
have
to
give
them
back
it
no
use
your
waiting
here
i
wo
budge
an
inch
i
she
paused
abruptly
suddenly
catching
sight
of
fullaway
who
at
once
moved
towards
her
with
a
confidential
and
reassuring
smile
you
she
exclaimed
what
brings
you
here
and
who
that
with
you
surely
the
gentleman
of
whom
i
asked
my
way
in
some
wild
place
the
other
night
what
mademoiselle
said
fullaway
with
a
deep
bow
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
the
finest
thing
in
this
mundane
state
of
ours
is
reason
suppose
now
that
you
complete
your
toilet
tell
us
what
it
is
you
have
lost
leave
us
your
devoted
servants
to
begin
the
task
of
finding
it
and
while
we
are
so
engaged
hasten
with
weiss
to
the
hall
to
fulfil
your
engagement
a
packed
audience
awaits
you
palpitating
with
sympathy
and
and
curiosity
interjected
the
aggrieved
prima
donna
as
she
threw
a
hasty
glance
at
her
deshabille
and
snatched
up
the
kimono
pretty
talk
fullaway
very
and
all
intended
to
benefit
weiss
there
lost
indeed
i
lost
all
my
jewels
and
up
to
now
nobody
here
she
flashed
a
wrathful
glance
at
the
hotel
manager
and
the
two
detectives
nobody
has
made
a
single
suggestion
about
finding
them
fullaway
exchanged
looks
with
the
other
men
once
more
he
assumed
the
office
of
spokesman
perhaps
you
have
not
told
them
precisely
what
it
is
they
to
find
he
suggested
what
is
it
now
mademoiselle
the
pinkie
pell
necklace
for
instance
the
prima
donna
who
was
already
retreating
through
the
door
of
the
bedroom
on
whose
threshold
she
had
been
standing
flashed
a
scornful
look
at
her
questioner
over
the
point
of
her
white
shoulder
pinkie
pell
necklace
she
exclaimed
everything
gone
the
whole
lot
look
at
that
not
so
much
as
a
ring
left
in
it
she
pointed
a
slender
quivering
finger
to
a
box
which
stood
lid
thrown
open
on
a
table
in
the
by
which
the
detectives
were
standing
and
obviously
puzzled
allerdyke
following
the
pointing
finger
noted
that
the
box
was
a
very
affair
a
tiny
square
chest
of
polished
wood
fitted
with
a
brass
swing
handle
it
might
have
held
a
small
machine
it
might
have
been
a
medicine
chest
it
certainly
did
not
look
the
sort
of
thing
in
which
one
would
carry
priceless
jewels
but
mademoiselle
de
longarde
was
speaking
again
that
what
i
always
carried
my
jewels
in
in
their
cases
she
said
and
they
were
all
in
there
when
i
left
christiania
a
few
days
ago
and
that
box
has
never
been
out
of
my
sight
so
to
speak
since
and
when
i
opened
it
here
wanting
the
things
it
was
as
empty
as
it
is
now
and
if
i
behave
handsomely
and
go
with
weiss
there
to
fulfil
this
engagement
it
only
be
on
condition
that
you
stop
here
fullaway
and
do
your
level
best
to
get
me
my
jewels
back
i
done
all
i
can
told
the
manager
there
and
i
told
those
two
policemen
and
not
a
man
of
them
seems
able
to
suggest
anything
perhaps
you
can
with
that
she
disappeared
and
slammed
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
the
six
men
left
in
a
bunch
looked
at
each
other
then
one
of
the
detectives
spoke
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
grimly
it
all
very
well
to
say
we
suggest
nothing
he
said
we
want
some
facts
to
go
on
first
up
to
now
all
the
lady
done
is
to
storm
at
us
and
at
everybody
she
seems
to
think
all
edinburgh
in
a
conspiracy
to
rob
her
we
do
know
any
circumstances
yet
except
that
she
says
been
robbed
perhaps
wait
a
bit
interrupted
fullaway
let
us
get
her
off
to
her
engagement
then
we
can
talk
i
suppose
he
continued
turning
to
the
manager
she
first
announced
her
loss
to
you
she
announced
her
loss
to
the
whole
world
in
a
way
of
speaking
answered
the
manager
with
a
dry
laugh
she
screamed
it
out
over
the
main
staircase
into
the
hall
everybody
in
the
place
knows
it
by
this
time
she
took
good
care
they
should
i
know
how
she
can
have
been
robbed
so
far
as
i
can
learn
she
scarcely
been
out
of
these
rooms
since
she
came
into
them
yesterday
afternoon
the
grand
piano
had
been
put
in
for
her
before
she
arrived
and
she
spent
all
her
time
singing
and
playing
i
do
believe
she
ever
left
the
hotel
and
as
i
pointed
out
to
her
when
she
fetched
me
up
she
found
this
box
locked
when
she
went
to
it
why
did
the
thieves
carry
it
bodily
away
why
just
so
just
so
broke
in
fullaway
i
quite
appreciate
your
points
but
there
is
more
in
this
than
meets
the
first
glance
let
us
get
mademoiselle
off
to
her
engagement
i
say
that
the
first
thing
then
we
can
do
business
weiss
he
continued
drawing
the
aside
you
must
arrange
to
let
her
appear
as
soon
as
possible
after
you
get
back
to
the
hall
and
to
put
forward
her
appearance
in
the
second
half
of
your
program
so
that
she
can
return
here
as
soon
as
possible
she
only
be
in
irrepressible
fidgets
until
she
knows
been
done
and
you
know
what
she
is
you
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
go
with
you
mademoiselle
he
went
on
as
the
prima
donna
fully
attired
but
innocent
of
jewelled
ornament
swept
into
the
room
you
are
doing
the
right
thing
bravely
go
sing
sing
your
best
your
divinest
let
your
admiring
audience
recognize
that
you
have
a
soul
above
even
serious
misfortune
meanwhile
allow
me
to
order
your
supper
to
be
served
in
this
room
for
eleven
and
permit
me
and
my
friend
allerdyke
to
invite
ourselves
to
share
it
with
you
then
we
will
give
you
some
news
that
will
interest
and
astonish
you
that
only
makes
me
all
the
more
frantic
to
get
back
exclaimed
the
prima
donna
come
along
now
weiss
you
got
a
car
outside
i
suppose
hurry
then
and
let
me
get
it
over
when
the
vastly
relieved
had
led
his
bundle
of
silks
and
laces
safely
out
fullaway
laughed
and
turned
to
the
other
men
now
gentlemen
he
said
perhaps
we
can
have
a
little
quiet
talk
about
this
affair
he
flung
himself
into
a
seat
and
nodded
at
the
just
tell
us
exactly
what
happened
since
mademoiselle
arrived
here
he
said
let
get
an
accurate
notion
of
all
her
doings
she
came
when
she
got
here
about
the
beginning
of
yesterday
afternoon
answered
the
manager
who
did
not
appear
to
be
too
well
pleased
about
this
disturbance
of
his
usual
proceedings
she
has
always
had
this
suite
of
rooms
whenever
she
has
sung
in
edinburgh
before
and
it
was
understood
that
whenever
she
wrote
or
wired
for
them
we
were
to
arrange
for
a
grand
piano
properly
tuned
to
to
be
put
in
for
her
she
wrote
for
the
suite
over
a
fortnight
ago
from
russia
and
of
course
we
had
everything
in
readiness
for
her
she
turned
up
as
i
say
yesterday
alone
she
explained
something
about
her
maid
having
been
obliged
to
leave
her
on
arrival
in
england
and
since
she
came
she
had
the
services
of
one
of
our
smartest
chambermaids
whom
she
herself
picked
out
after
carefully
inspecting
a
whole
dozen
of
them
that
chambermaid
can
tell
you
that
mademoiselle
scarcely
left
her
rooms
since
then
and
an
absolute
mystery
to
me
that
any
person
could
get
in
here
open
this
box
and
abstract
its
contents
as
i
say
if
anybody
wanted
to
steal
her
jewels
why
did
he
pick
up
this
box
and
carry
it
bodily
off
instead
of
hanging
about
to
pick
the
lock
i
do
believe
ah
quite
so
interrupted
fullaway
i
quite
agree
with
you
now
at
what
time
did
mademoiselle
announce
the
loss
of
her
jewels
oh
about
say
an
hour
ago
this
chambermaid
she
there
in
the
bedroom
now
was
helping
her
to
dress
for
the
concert
she
mademoiselle
went
to
this
box
to
get
out
what
ornaments
she
wanted
according
to
the
girl
she
let
out
an
awful
scream
and
just
as
she
was
rushed
to
the
head
of
the
main
stairs
these
rooms
as
you
see
are
on
our
first
floor
and
began
to
shout
for
me
for
anybody
for
everybody
the
hall
below
was
just
then
full
of
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
and
so
on
she
set
the
whole
place
going
with
the
noise
she
made
added
the
manager
visibly
annoyed
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
she
shown
some
reserve
reserve
is
certainly
an
admirable
quality
commented
fullaway
but
it
is
foreign
to
young
ladies
of
mademoiselle
temperament
well
and
then
oh
then
of
course
i
came
up
to
her
suite
she
showed
me
this
box
it
had
stood
she
declared
on
a
table
by
her
bedside
close
to
her
pillows
from
the
moment
she
entered
her
rooms
yesterday
she
swore
that
it
ought
to
have
been
full
of
her
jewels
in
cases
when
she
had
opened
it
just
before
this
it
was
empty
of
course
she
demanded
the
instant
presence
of
the
police
also
she
insisted
that
i
should
at
once
that
minute
lock
every
door
in
the
hotel
and
arrest
every
person
in
it
until
their
effects
and
themselves
could
be
rigorously
searched
and
examined
ridiculous
as
you
doubtless
said
remarked
fullaway
no
i
said
nothing
instead
i
telephoned
for
police
assistance
these
two
officers
came
and
concluded
the
manager
with
a
sympathetic
glance
at
the
detectives
since
they
came
mademoiselle
has
done
nothing
but
insist
on
arresting
every
soul
within
these
walls
she
seems
to
think
there
a
universal
conspiracy
against
her
exactly
said
fullaway
it
is
precisely
what
she
would
think
under
the
circumstances
now
let
us
see
this
chambermaid
the
manager
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
called
in
a
pretty
somewhat
shy
scotch
damsel
who
betrayed
a
becoming
confusion
at
the
sight
of
so
many
strangers
but
she
gave
a
plain
and
straightforward
account
of
her
relations
with
mademoiselle
since
the
arrival
of
yesterday
she
had
been
in
almost
constant
attendance
on
mademoiselle
ever
since
her
election
to
the
post
of
temporary
maid
had
never
left
her
save
at
the
little
chest
had
stood
at
mademoiselle
always
she
had
never
seen
it
moved
or
opened
there
was
a
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
from
the
corridor
mademoiselle
had
never
left
the
suite
of
rooms
since
her
arrival
she
had
talked
that
morning
of
going
for
a
drive
but
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
she
had
stayed
in
mademoiselle
had
seemed
utterly
horrified
when
she
discovered
her
loss
for
a
moment
she
had
sunk
on
her
bed
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
then
she
had
rushed
out
into
the
corridor
just
as
she
was
screaming
for
the
manager
and
the
police
when
the
pretty
chambermaid
had
retired
fullaway
took
up
the
box
from
which
the
missing
property
was
believed
to
have
been
abstracted
he
examined
it
with
seeming
indifference
yet
he
announced
its
particulars
and
specifications
with
accuracy
well
this
chest
cabinet
or
box
he
observed
carelessly
let
us
look
at
it
here
gentlemen
we
have
a
piece
of
work
it
is
yes
eighteen
inches
square
all
ways
it
is
made
of
yes
rosewood
its
corners
you
see
are
clamped
with
brass
it
has
a
swing
handle
fitted
into
this
brass
plate
which
is
sunk
into
the
lid
it
has
also
three
brass
letters
sunk
into
that
lid
its
lock
does
not
appear
to
be
of
anything
but
an
ordinary
nature
taking
it
altogether
i
do
think
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
in
which
you
would
believe
a
lady
was
carrying
several
thousand
pounds
worth
of
pearls
and
diamonds
eh
one
of
the
detectives
stirred
uneasily
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
american
light
and
easy
manner
and
he
seemed
to
suspect
him
of
persiflage
we
ought
to
be
furnished
with
a
list
of
the
missing
articles
he
said
that
the
first
thing
by
no
means
replied
fullaway
that
my
dear
sir
is
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
thing
there
is
much
to
do
before
we
get
to
that
stage
at
present
you
gentlemen
can
not
do
anything
morning
perhaps
when
i
have
consulted
with
mademoiselle
de
longarde
i
may
call
you
in
again
or
call
upon
you
in
the
meantime
there
no
need
to
detain
you
now
he
continued
turning
to
the
manager
when
the
detectives
somewhat
puzzled
and
bewildered
had
left
the
room
will
you
see
that
your
nicest
supper
is
served
for
three
in
this
room
at
eleven
against
mademoiselle
return
send
up
your
best
champagne
and
do
not
allow
yourself
to
dwell
on
agitation
on
discovering
her
loss
that
agitation
was
natural
if
it
is
any
consolation
to
you
i
will
give
you
a
conclusion
which
may
be
satisfactory
to
your
peace
of
mind
as
manager
what
is
it
merely
this
that
though
mademoiselle
de
longarde
has
undoubtedly
lost
her
jewels
they
were
certainly
not
stolen
from
her
in
this
hotel
chapter
ix
the
lady
maid
mother
when
the
manager
much
appeased
and
relieved
in
mind
had
gone
fullaway
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
summoned
the
pretty
chambermaid
and
handed
her
the
rosewood
box
put
this
back
exactly
where
mademoiselle
has
kept
it
since
she
came
here
he
commanded
now
you
yourself
you
going
to
stay
in
the
rooms
until
she
comes
back
from
the
concert
that
right
if
she
returns
before
my
friend
and
i
come
up
again
tell
her
that
we
shall
present
ourselves
at
five
minutes
to
eleven
come
downstairs
allerdyke
he
proceeded
leading
the
way
from
the
room
we
must
book
rooms
for
the
night
here
so
we
send
to
the
station
for
our
things
and
make
our
arrangements
after
which
we
smoke
a
cigar
and
talk
i
am
beginning
to
see
chinks
of
daylight
he
led
allerdyke
down
to
the
office
completed
the
necessary
arrangements
and
went
on
to
the
in
a
quiet
corner
of
which
he
pulled
out
his
well
he
said
what
do
you
think
now
i
think
you
a
smart
chap
answered
allerdyke
bluntly
you
did
all
that
very
well
i
said
naught
but
i
kept
an
eye
and
an
ear
open
you
do
very
complimentary
but
i
was
asking
you
what
you
thought
about
me
said
fullaway
with
a
laugh
i
asking
you
what
you
think
of
the
situation
as
illuminated
by
this
last
episode
well
i
still
reflecting
on
what
you
said
to
that
manager
chap
answered
allerdyke
you
really
think
this
young
woman
has
lost
her
jewels
oh
no
doubt
no
doubt
at
all
replied
fullaway
mademoiselle
is
impetuous
impulsive
demonstrative
much
given
to
insisting
on
her
own
way
but
she
absolutely
honest
and
truthful
and
i
no
doubt
whatever
none
that
she
been
robbed
but
not
here
she
never
brought
those
jewels
here
they
were
not
in
that
box
when
she
came
here
mademoiselle
my
dear
sir
was
relieved
of
those
jewels
either
on
the
steamer
as
she
crossed
from
christiania
to
hull
or
during
the
few
hours
she
spent
at
the
hull
hotel
the
whole
thing
the
robbery
from
your
cousin
the
robbery
from
mademoiselle
de
longarde
is
all
the
work
of
a
particularly
clever
and
brilliant
gang
of
international
thieves
and
by
the
holy
smoke
sir
we
got
our
hands
full
for
there
is
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
operators
so
far
unless
the
lady
with
whom
we
are
going
to
sup
can
help
us
to
one
allerdyke
ruminated
over
this
for
a
moment
or
two
then
after
lighting
the
cigar
which
fullaway
had
offered
him
he
shook
his
head
in
grim
affirmation
i
should
wonder
he
said
certainly
it
seems
a
big
thing
figuring
on
its
having
been
a
carefully
concocted
scheme
no
mere
chance
affair
eh
this
sort
of
thing
never
done
by
chance
responded
the
american
this
is
the
work
of
very
clever
and
accomplished
thieves
who
somehow
became
aware
of
two
facts
one
that
your
cousin
was
bringing
with
him
to
england
the
jewels
of
the
princess
nastirsevitch
the
other
that
mademoiselle
zélie
de
longarde
carried
her
pearls
and
diamonds
in
an
rosewood
box
my
dear
sir
you
observed
that
i
examined
that
box
with
seeming
carelessness
in
reality
i
was
looking
at
it
with
the
eye
of
a
trained
observer
i
am
one
of
those
people
who
from
having
knocked
about
the
world
a
lot
engaging
in
a
multifarious
variety
of
occupations
have
picked
up
a
queer
of
knowledge
and
i
will
lay
you
any
odds
you
like
that
i
am
absolutely
correct
in
affirming
that
the
box
which
i
just
now
handed
to
maggie
the
chambermaid
was
newly
made
by
a
russian
within
the
last
four
weeks
for
a
purpose
suggested
allerdyke
just
so
for
a
purpose
assented
fullaway
that
purpose
being
of
course
its
substitution
for
the
real
original
article
you
did
not
handle
the
box
which
is
now
upstairs
it
is
carefully
weighted
though
it
is
empty
i
believe
nay
i
am
sure
it
contains
a
sheet
of
lead
under
its
delicate
lining
of
satin
that
of
course
was
to
deceive
mademoiselle
you
heard
her
say
that
the
jewels
were
in
her
box
at
christiania
and
that
she
never
opened
the
box
until
this
evening
here
in
edinburgh
very
good
between
here
and
christiania
somebody
substituted
the
imitation
box
for
the
real
one
ah
in
all
these
great
criminal
operations
there
is
nothing
like
sticking
to
the
old
tricks
of
the
trade
they
are
like
machinery
and
now
we
come
back
to
the
real
great
anxious
question
who
did
it
and
there
allerdyke
we
are
at
present
only
at
present
mind
up
against
a
very
big
blank
wall
on
the
other
side
of
which
my
lad
lies
the
secret
of
the
murder
of
my
cousin
said
allerdyke
grimly
mind
you
that
that
what
i
after
fullaway
damn
all
these
jewels
and
things
in
comparison
with
that
it
that
i
after
i
tell
you
again
and
a
thousand
times
again
and
i
considering
if
i
doing
any
good
hanging
round
here
after
this
singing
woman
when
the
probable
sphere
of
action
lies
yonder
away
at
hull
eh
the
proper
not
probable
sphere
of
action
my
dear
sir
is
the
to
which
we
presently
going
answered
fullaway
with
supreme
assurance
what
the
singing
woman
as
you
call
her
can
tell
us
will
most
likely
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
our
investigations
remember
the
have
it
ready
to
exhibit
when
i
lead
up
to
it
then
we
shall
see
the
prima
donna
back
for
her
engagement
at
eleven
came
in
flushed
and
smiling
the
extraordinary
warmth
and
fervour
of
her
reception
by
the
audience
which
she
had
at
first
been
so
inclined
to
treat
with
scant
courtesy
had
restored
her
to
good
humour
and
when
she
had
eaten
a
few
mouthfuls
of
delicate
food
and
drunk
her
first
glass
of
champagne
she
began
to
laugh
almost
well
i
suppose
you
been
doing
your
best
fullaway
she
said
with
easy
familiarity
i
declare
you
turned
up
at
the
very
moment
for
that
fat
weiss
would
have
been
no
good
but
i
still
wondering
how
you
came
to
be
here
and
what
this
gentleman
allerdyke
is
it
is
doing
here
with
you
allerdyke
now
well
that
the
same
name
as
that
of
a
man
i
came
across
from
christiania
with
and
left
at
hull
fullaway
kicked
allerdyke
under
the
table
you
have
heard
of
that
allerdyke
since
you
left
him
at
hull
then
he
asked
gazing
intently
at
their
hostess
heard
how
should
i
hear
asked
the
prima
donna
he
was
just
a
travelling
acquaintance
all
the
same
i
had
certainly
fixed
up
to
see
him
in
london
on
a
business
matter
you
do
read
the
newspapers
then
suggested
fullaway
not
unless
there
something
about
myself
in
them
she
answered
with
an
arch
smile
at
allerdyke
if
you
read
this
morning
papers
you
have
seen
that
the
allerdyke
with
whom
you
travelled
this
gentleman
cousin
by
the
by
was
found
dead
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
in
hull
not
so
long
after
you
quitted
it
said
fullaway
coolly
in
fact
he
must
have
been
dead
when
you
passed
his
door
on
your
way
out
the
prima
donna
was
genuinely
shocked
she
set
down
the
glass
which
she
was
just
lifting
to
her
lips
her
large
handsome
eyes
dilated
her
lips
quivered
a
little
she
turned
a
look
of
sympathy
on
allerdyke
who
at
that
moment
realized
that
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
you
do
say
so
she
exclaimed
well
i
really
grieved
to
hear
that
i
am
dead
and
when
i
left
why
i
was
in
his
room
that
very
night
we
reached
hull
having
a
talk
on
the
business
matter
i
mentioned
just
now
he
was
well
enough
and
lively
enough
then
i
swear
dead
why
what
did
he
die
of
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
there
was
a
brief
pause
then
allerdyke
slowly
produced
a
small
packet
wrapped
in
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
laid
it
on
the
table
at
his
side
and
looked
at
his
hostess
i
knew
you
had
been
in
my
cousin
room
he
said
you
left
or
dropped
your
there
i
found
it
when
i
searched
his
room
then
the
hotel
manager
showed
me
your
wire
here
the
buckle
he
was
watching
her
narrowly
as
he
spoke
and
his
glance
deepened
in
intensity
as
he
handed
over
the
little
packet
and
watched
her
unwrap
the
paper
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
anything
but
a
little
surprised
satisfaction
in
the
prima
donna
face
as
she
recognized
her
lost
property
and
her
eyes
were
ingenuous
enough
as
she
turned
them
on
him
why
of
course
that
mine
she
exclaimed
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
allerdyke
yes
i
wired
to
the
hotel
in
my
proper
name
you
know
zélie
de
longarde
is
only
my
professional
name
i
did
want
to
lose
that
buckle
it
was
part
of
a
birthday
present
from
my
mother
but
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
travelled
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
to
hand
me
that
surely
not
no
replied
allerdyke
he
wanted
to
take
a
direct
share
in
the
talking
and
went
resolutely
ahead
now
that
the
chance
had
come
no
not
at
all
i
knew
you
come
to
edinburgh
found
it
out
from
that
chauffeur
who
was
driving
you
when
you
and
i
met
at
howden
the
night
before
last
and
so
i
came
on
to
find
you
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
my
cousin
and
maybe
to
get
you
to
come
and
give
evidence
at
the
inquest
on
him
inquest
she
exclaimed
i
know
what
that
means
of
course
why
you
do
say
there
been
anything
wrong
i
believe
my
cousin
was
murdered
that
night
answered
allerdyke
so
too
does
fullaway
there
and
you
were
probably
the
last
person
who
ever
spoke
to
him
alive
now
you
see
i
a
plain
sort
of
chap
i
ask
people
straight
questions
what
did
you
go
into
his
room
to
talk
to
him
about
business
she
replied
with
a
directness
which
impressed
both
men
mere
business
he
and
i
had
several
conversations
on
board
the
i
made
out
he
was
a
clever
business
man
i
want
to
invest
some
money
he
advised
me
to
put
it
into
a
development
company
in
norway
which
is
doing
big
things
in
fir
and
pine
i
went
into
his
room
to
look
at
some
plans
and
papers
he
gave
me
some
prospectuses
which
are
in
that
bag
there
just
now
was
reading
them
over
again
only
this
evening
that
all
i
was
there
many
minutes
and
as
i
told
you
he
was
very
well
very
brisk
and
lively
then
did
he
show
you
any
valuables
that
he
had
with
him
jewels
asked
allerdyke
brusquely
jewels
valuables
she
answered
no
certainly
not
nor
when
you
were
on
the
steamer
no
nor
at
any
time
she
said
jewels
why
what
makes
you
ask
such
a
question
because
my
cousin
had
in
his
possession
a
consignment
of
such
things
of
great
value
and
we
believe
that
he
was
murdered
for
them
that
why
replied
allerdyke
he
had
them
when
he
left
christiania
he
had
them
when
he
entered
the
hull
hotel
fullaway
who
had
been
listening
intently
leant
forward
with
a
shake
of
his
head
stop
at
that
allerdyke
he
said
we
do
know
now
that
he
did
have
them
when
he
entered
the
hotel
at
hull
he
may
have
had
miss
lennard
we
drop
the
professional
name
and
turn
to
the
real
one
he
said
with
a
bow
to
the
prima
donna
miss
lennard
here
thinks
she
had
her
jewels
in
her
little
box
when
she
entered
the
hull
hotel
and
also
when
she
came
to
this
hotel
here
in
edinburgh
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
had
she
exclaimed
do
you
mean
i
mean
replied
fullaway
that
knowing
what
i
now
know
i
believe
that
both
you
and
the
dead
man
james
allerdyke
were
robbed
on
the
and
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
at
once
where
is
your
maid
celia
lennard
dropped
her
knife
and
fork
and
sat
back
suddenly
turning
pale
my
maid
she
said
faintly
good
heavens
you
do
think
oh
you
are
suggesting
that
she
the
thief
because
oh
this
is
dreadful
you
see
i
never
thought
of
it
before
when
she
and
i
arrived
at
hull
that
night
she
was
met
by
a
man
who
described
himself
as
her
brother
he
was
in
a
great
state
of
agitation
he
said
he
rushed
up
to
hull
to
meet
her
to
beg
her
to
go
straight
with
him
to
their
mother
who
was
dying
in
london
of
course
i
let
her
go
at
once
they
drove
straight
from
the
riverside
at
hull
to
the
station
to
catch
the
train
what
else
could
i
do
i
never
suspected
anything
oh
fullaway
leaned
across
the
table
and
filled
his
hostess
glass
now
he
said
motioning
her
to
drink
you
know
your
maid
name
and
address
do
you
let
me
have
them
at
once
and
within
a
couple
of
hours
we
know
if
the
story
about
the
dying
mother
was
true
chapter
x
the
second
murder
it
had
been
very
evident
to
allerdyke
that
ever
since
fullaway
had
mentioned
the
matter
of
the
missing
maid
celia
lennard
had
become
a
victim
to
doubt
suspicion
and
uncertainty
her
colour
came
and
went
her
eyes
began
to
show
signs
of
tears
her
voice
shook
and
now
at
the
american
direct
question
she
wrung
her
hands
with
an
almost
despairing
gesture
but
i
ca
she
exclaimed
i
do
know
her
address
how
should
i
it
somewhere
in
london
bloomsbury
i
think
but
even
then
i
do
know
if
that
where
her
mother
lives
to
whom
she
said
she
was
going
i
did
know
her
address
i
mean
i
remembered
it
for
a
while
at
the
time
i
engaged
her
a
year
ago
but
i
forgotten
it
oh
do
you
really
think
she
robbed
me
or
helped
to
rob
me
never
mind
opinions
answered
fullaway
curtly
they
no
good
is
this
the
maid
you
brought
with
you
once
or
twice
when
you
called
at
my
office
some
time
ago
over
the
pinkie
pell
deal
yes
yes
the
same
she
answered
a
frenchwoman
said
fullaway
yes
lisette
of
course
she
went
with
me
to
your
office
that
was
eight
or
nine
months
ago
and
i
had
her
a
year
and
i
had
excellent
testimonials
with
her
too
oh
i
ca
think
that
ca
you
make
an
effort
to
remember
her
address
urged
fullaway
what
can
we
do
until
we
know
that
celia
drew
her
fine
eyebrows
together
in
a
palpable
effort
to
think
i
got
it
somewhere
she
said
at
last
i
must
have
it
somewhere
most
likely
in
an
at
my
flat
i
should
be
sure
to
put
it
down
at
the
time
who
is
there
at
your
flat
asked
fullaway
my
housekeeper
and
a
maid
answered
celia
they
always
there
whether
i
at
home
or
not
but
they
could
get
at
what
you
want
all
my
papers
and
things
are
locked
up
and
in
a
hopeless
state
of
confusion
too
fullaway
pushed
aside
his
plate
then
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
he
said
with
an
accent
of
finality
we
must
go
up
to
town
at
once
allerdyke
still
quietly
eating
his
supper
looked
up
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
suggest
he
said
there
no
good
to
be
done
hanging
about
here
let
get
on
to
the
scene
of
operations
if
miss
lennard
maid
has
stolen
her
jewels
she
probably
had
some
hand
in
the
theft
from
my
cousin
we
must
find
her
now
then
let
me
come
in
i
look
up
the
train
settle
up
with
these
hotel
folk
and
we
be
off
you
give
your
attention
to
your
packing
miss
lennard
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
you
wo
mind
travelling
the
night
celia
shook
her
head
i
do
mind
travelling
all
night
for
half
a
dozen
nights
if
i
can
track
my
lost
property
she
said
lugubriously
you
dead
sure
it
no
use
stopping
here
that
the
robbery
did
take
place
here
sure
answered
fullaway
we
must
get
off
that
french
damsel
got
to
be
found
somehow
the
came
to
an
end
the
prima
donna
and
her
temporary
maid
began
to
bustle
with
garments
and
trunks
the
two
men
attended
to
all
other
necessary
matters
and
at
two
in
the
morning
the
three
sped
out
of
edinburgh
for
the
south
each
secretly
wondering
what
was
going
to
come
of
their
journey
allerdyke
preparing
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
compartment
which
he
and
fullaway
occupied
by
themselves
dropped
one
grim
remark
to
his
companion
as
he
settled
himself
seems
like
a
chase
this
my
lad
but
it
one
we
got
to
go
through
with
what
the
next
stage
be
the
next
stage
was
an
arrival
in
london
in
the
middle
of
a
lovely
may
morning
a
swift
drive
to
celia
lennard
flat
in
bedford
court
mansions
the
hurried
rummaging
of
its
owner
amongst
an
extraordinary
mass
of
papers
books
and
documents
and
the
ultimate
discovery
of
the
french
maid
address
celia
held
it
up
with
a
sigh
of
vast
relief
which
changed
into
a
groan
of
despairing
doubt
there
it
is
she
exclaimed
lisette
beaurepaire
bernard
street
bloomsbury
i
knew
it
was
bloomsbury
that
where
she
lived
when
i
engaged
her
anyhow
but
then
her
sick
mother
may
live
there
the
man
who
met
her
at
hull
who
said
he
was
her
brother
did
say
where
the
mother
lived
except
that
it
was
in
london
we
must
go
to
bernard
street
anyway
at
once
said
fullaway
we
may
get
some
information
there
but
such
information
as
they
got
on
the
of
bernard
street
was
scanty
and
useless
the
house
was
a
typical
bloomsbury
let
off
in
floors
and
rooms
its
proprietor
summoned
from
a
neighbouring
house
recollected
with
considerable
difficulty
and
after
consultation
of
a
penny
that
he
had
certainly
let
a
room
to
a
young
frenchwoman
about
a
year
ago
but
he
had
never
caught
her
name
properly
and
simply
had
her
noted
down
as
mamselle
she
had
paid
her
rent
regularly
and
had
remained
in
the
house
five
weeks
that
was
all
he
knew
about
her
had
he
ever
seen
her
since
not
that
he
knew
of
in
fact
he
should
know
her
if
he
saw
her
they
were
all
pretty
much
alike
these
young
frenchwomen
did
he
know
where
she
came
from
to
his
house
where
she
went
from
his
house
not
he
he
knew
no
more
than
what
he
had
just
told
what
now
asked
allerdyke
as
the
three
searchers
paced
dejectedly
up
the
street
this
is
doing
no
good
it
worse
than
the
hull
affair
however
there
one
thing
suggests
itself
to
me
did
you
say
he
went
on
turning
to
celia
that
you
had
some
very
good
testimonials
with
this
young
woman
if
so
and
you
still
got
them
we
might
trace
her
in
that
way
i
had
some
and
i
may
have
them
still
but
you
saw
just
now
what
an
awful
mess
all
my
letters
and
papers
are
in
replied
celia
almost
tearfully
i
always
do
get
things
like
that
into
hopeless
confusion
i
never
know
what
to
destroy
and
what
to
keep
and
they
accumulate
so
it
would
take
hours
upon
hours
to
look
for
those
letters
and
in
the
meantime
in
the
meantime
remarked
fullaway
as
he
signalled
to
a
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
we
must
go
to
the
police
get
in
both
of
you
and
let
make
haste
to
new
scotland
yard
once
more
allerdyke
received
an
impression
of
the
american
usefulness
and
practical
acquaintance
with
things
fullaway
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
whom
to
approach
how
to
go
about
the
business
in
hand
within
a
few
minutes
all
three
were
closeted
with
a
high
official
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
barrister
a
medical
specialist
or
a
scientist
of
distinction
and
who
maintained
an
unmoved
countenance
and
a
perfect
silence
while
fullaway
unfolded
the
story
he
and
allerdyke
had
held
a
brief
consultation
as
they
drove
from
bloomsbury
to
whitehall
and
they
had
decided
that
as
things
had
now
reached
a
critical
stage
it
would
be
best
to
tell
the
authorities
everything
therefore
the
american
narrated
the
entire
sequence
of
events
as
they
related
not
only
to
mademoiselle
de
longarde
loss
but
to
the
death
of
james
allerdyke
and
the
disappearance
of
the
nastirsevitch
valuables
and
the
official
heard
and
made
mental
notes
soaking
everything
into
some
proper
cell
of
his
brain
and
he
said
nothing
until
fullaway
had
come
to
an
end
and
at
that
end
he
turned
to
celia
lennard
you
can
of
course
describe
your
maid
he
asked
certainly
answered
celia
to
every
detail
do
so
if
you
please
continued
the
official
producing
a
pile
of
papers
from
a
drawer
and
turning
them
over
until
he
came
to
one
which
he
drew
from
the
rest
a
frenchwoman
said
celia
aged
i
should
say
about
tall
slender
but
not
thin
of
a
very
good
figure
black
hair
a
quantity
of
it
black
eyes
very
penetrating
fresh
colour
not
exactly
pretty
but
attractive
in
the
real
parisian
way
she
is
a
parisian
dressed
when
she
left
me
at
hull
in
a
black
coat
and
skirt
and
carrying
a
travelling
coat
of
black
lined
with
fur
one
i
gave
her
in
russia
her
luggage
asked
the
official
she
had
a
a
one
large
enough
i
presume
to
conceal
the
your
friend
has
told
me
about
just
now
oh
yes
certainly
the
official
put
his
papers
back
in
the
drawer
and
turned
to
his
visitors
with
a
look
which
finally
settled
itself
on
celia
face
you
must
be
prepared
to
hear
some
serious
news
he
said
i
mean
about
this
woman
i
have
no
doubt
from
what
you
have
just
told
me
that
i
know
where
she
is
where
demanded
celia
excitedly
you
know
where
then
lying
in
the
mortuary
at
paddington
answered
the
official
quietly
in
spite
of
celia
strong
nerves
she
half
rose
in
her
seat
only
to
drop
back
with
a
sharp
exclamation
dead
probably
murdered
and
i
should
say
continued
the
official
with
a
glance
at
the
two
men
murdered
in
the
same
way
as
the
gentleman
you
have
told
me
of
was
murdered
at
hull
by
some
subtle
strange
and
secret
poison
no
one
spoke
for
a
minute
or
two
when
the
silence
was
broken
it
was
by
allerdyke
i
should
like
to
know
about
this
he
said
in
a
hard
keen
voice
getting
about
sick
of
delay
in
this
affair
of
my
cousin
and
if
this
murder
of
the
young
woman
is
all
of
a
piece
with
his
why
then
the
sooner
we
all
get
to
work
the
better
i
not
going
to
spare
time
labour
nor
expense
in
running
that
lot
down
understand
naught
to
me
i
willing
we
are
already
at
work
allerdyke
said
the
official
interrupting
him
quietly
we
been
at
work
in
the
affair
of
the
young
woman
for
hours
and
although
you
did
know
of
it
we
heard
of
the
affair
of
your
cousin
at
hull
and
the
two
cases
are
so
similar
that
when
you
came
in
i
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
connection
between
them
now
as
regards
the
young
woman
you
may
or
may
not
be
aware
that
in
eastbourne
terrace
paddington
a
street
of
houses
which
runs
alongside
the
departure
platform
of
the
great
western
railway
there
are
a
number
of
small
private
hotels
which
are
largely
used
by
railway
passengers
to
one
of
these
hotels
about
nine
on
the
evening
of
may
just
about
hours
after
you
miss
lennard
landed
at
hull
there
came
a
man
and
a
woman
who
represented
themselves
as
brother
and
sister
and
took
two
rooms
for
the
night
the
woman
answers
the
description
of
your
maid
as
to
the
man
i
will
give
you
a
description
of
him
later
these
two
who
had
for
luggage
such
a
as
that
miss
lennard
has
spoken
of
partook
of
some
supper
and
retired
there
was
nothing
noticeable
about
them
they
seemed
to
be
quiet
respectable
people
foreigners
who
spoke
english
very
well
nothing
was
heard
of
them
until
next
morning
at
eight
when
the
man
rang
his
bell
and
asked
for
tea
to
be
brought
up
for
both
this
was
done
he
took
it
in
at
his
door
and
was
seen
to
hand
a
cup
in
at
his
sister
door
close
by
an
hour
later
he
came
downstairs
and
gave
instructions
that
his
sister
was
not
to
be
disturbed
she
was
tired
and
wanted
to
rest
he
said
and
she
would
ring
when
she
wanted
attendance
he
then
booked
the
two
rooms
again
for
the
succeeding
night
and
going
into
the
ate
a
very
good
breakfast
taking
his
time
over
it
that
done
he
lounged
about
a
little
smoking
and
eventually
crossed
the
road
towards
the
station
since
when
he
has
not
been
seen
the
day
passed
on
the
woman
neither
rang
her
bell
nor
came
down
when
evening
arrived
as
the
man
had
not
returned
and
no
response
could
be
got
to
repeated
knocks
at
the
door
the
landlady
opened
it
with
a
and
entered
the
room
she
found
the
woman
dead
and
according
to
the
medical
evidence
she
had
been
dead
since
ten
or
eleven
in
the
morning
then
of
course
the
police
were
called
in
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
or
in
the
to
establish
or
suggest
identity
the
body
was
removed
and
an
autopsy
has
been
held
and
the
conclusion
of
the
medical
men
is
that
this
woman
has
been
secretly
and
subtly
poisoned
here
the
official
paused
rang
a
bell
and
remained
silent
until
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
highly
respectable
butler
entered
the
room
then
he
turned
again
to
his
visitors
i
want
you
miss
lennard
to
accompany
this
man
one
of
my
officers
to
the
mortuary
to
see
if
you
can
identify
the
body
i
have
told
you
of
perhaps
you
gentlemen
will
accompany
miss
lennard
then
he
continued
rising
if
you
will
all
return
here
we
will
go
into
this
matter
further
and
see
if
we
can
throw
more
light
on
it
allerdyke
next
impressions
were
of
a
swift
drive
across
london
to
a
quiet
retreat
in
paddington
where
in
a
building
set
amidst
trees
men
conducted
him
and
his
two
companions
into
a
sort
of
annex
one
side
of
which
was
covered
with
sheet
glass
on
the
other
side
of
that
glass
he
became
aware
of
a
still
figure
shrouded
and
arranged
in
formal
lines
of
a
white
face
set
amidst
dark
hair
then
as
in
a
dream
he
heard
celia
lennard
frightened
whisper
that
she
that
lisette
oh
for
god
sake
take
me
out
chapter
xi
the
russian
the
three
searchers
into
what
was
rapidly
becoming
a
most
complicated
mystery
drove
back
to
new
scotland
yard
in
a
silence
which
lasted
until
they
were
set
down
at
the
door
of
the
department
whereat
they
had
interviewed
the
high
official
celia
lennard
was
thoroughly
upset
the
sight
of
the
dead
woman
had
disturbed
her
even
more
than
she
let
her
companions
see
she
remained
dumb
and
rigid
staring
straight
before
her
as
if
she
still
gazed
on
the
white
face
set
in
its
frame
of
dark
hair
allerdyke
too
stared
at
the
crowds
in
the
streets
as
if
they
were
abstract
visions
his
keen
brain
felt
dazed
and
mystified
by
this
accumulation
of
strange
events
and
fullaway
active
and
mercurial
though
he
was
made
no
attempt
at
conversation
he
sat
with
knitted
forehead
trying
to
think
to
account
to
surmise
only
conscious
that
he
was
up
against
a
bigger
mystery
than
life
had
ever
shown
him
up
to
then
the
detective
who
had
accompanied
them
to
the
mortuary
conducted
the
three
straight
back
to
his
chief
office
the
chief
noticing
the
effect
of
the
visit
on
celia
hastened
to
give
her
a
chair
at
the
side
of
his
desk
and
looked
at
her
with
a
lessening
of
his
official
manner
he
signed
to
the
other
two
to
sit
down
and
motioned
the
detective
to
remain
then
he
turned
to
celia
you
recognized
the
woman
he
said
softly
just
so
i
thought
you
would
and
i
was
sorry
to
ask
you
to
perform
such
an
unpleasant
task
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary
now
he
continued
taking
up
his
bundle
of
papers
again
i
want
you
to
describe
the
man
who
met
you
and
your
maid
on
your
arrival
at
hull
the
other
night
of
course
you
saw
him
certainly
i
saw
him
replied
celia
and
i
should
know
him
again
anywhere
the
scoundrel
the
high
official
smiled
and
glanced
at
fullaway
you
are
thinking
miss
lennard
that
the
man
you
then
saw
is
the
man
who
accompanied
your
maid
to
the
hotel
in
which
she
was
found
dead
he
said
well
that
may
be
so
but
it
may
that
is
why
i
want
you
to
give
us
an
accurate
description
of
the
man
you
saw
you
described
the
maid
very
well
indeed
now
describe
the
man
i
can
do
that
quite
well
said
celia
with
assurance
and
i
can
tell
you
the
circumstances
the
steamer
the
got
into
the
river
at
hull
about
a
quarter
to
nine
and
anchored
off
the
victoria
pier
we
understood
that
she
could
get
into
dock
just
then
because
of
the
tide
and
that
we
must
go
on
shore
by
tender
a
tender
came
off
some
of
the
people
on
board
it
came
on
our
deck
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bustle
i
went
down
to
my
cabin
to
see
after
something
or
other
lisette
came
to
me
there
evidently
much
agitated
saying
that
her
brother
had
come
off
on
the
tender
to
fetch
her
at
once
to
their
mother
who
was
ill
in
london
dying
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
with
him
of
course
i
said
she
might
she
immediately
picked
up
her
and
travelling
coat
out
of
our
pile
of
luggage
and
i
went
up
with
her
on
deck
she
and
the
man
her
brother
as
i
understood
got
into
a
small
boat
which
was
alongside
and
went
straight
off
to
the
pier
the
tender
was
not
leaving
for
shore
for
some
time
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
her
it
was
all
done
in
a
minute
or
two
now
the
man
suggested
the
chief
softly
a
young
man
about
lisette
age
i
should
say
to
thirty
anyway
tallish
dark
hair
moustache
eyes
and
complexion
in
a
foreign
way
i
had
no
doubt
he
was
her
brother
he
looked
french
though
he
spoke
english
quite
well
and
without
accent
very
respectably
dressed
in
dark
clothes
and
overcoat
he
would
have
passed
for
a
clerk
that
type
i
spoke
to
him
a
few
words
he
spoke
well
had
very
polite
almost
polished
manners
of
course
he
was
hurried
wanting
to
get
lisette
away
he
said
they
could
just
catch
the
last
train
to
london
the
chief
shook
his
head
not
the
man
who
accompanied
her
to
the
paddington
hotel
he
said
listen
this
is
the
description
of
that
man
as
given
to
the
police
by
the
landlady
and
her
servants
presumably
between
forty
and
years
medium
height
brown
hair
dressed
in
grey
tweed
suit
over
which
he
wore
a
overcoat
deerstalker
hat
light
brown
brown
brogue
shoes
that
you
see
continued
the
chief
describes
a
quite
different
person
you
do
not
recognize
the
description
as
that
of
any
man
you
have
ever
seen
in
company
with
your
late
maid
miss
lennard
i
never
saw
my
maid
in
any
man
company
replied
celia
since
i
first
engaged
her
we
have
not
been
much
in
london
i
was
in
new
york
and
chicago
for
a
time
last
year
then
in
paris
then
in
milan
and
turin
lately
in
moscow
and
petersburg
when
we
were
at
home
here
in
london
she
certainly
had
time
of
her
own
her
evenings
out
you
know
but
of
course
i
do
know
with
whom
she
spent
them
no
i
know
any
man
answering
that
description
the
chief
folded
up
his
papers
and
restored
them
to
his
desk
now
that
you
are
here
he
said
you
may
as
well
give
me
a
few
particulars
about
your
doings
on
the
especially
as
they
relate
to
james
allerdyke
when
and
where
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
on
the
steamer
a
few
hours
after
we
left
christiania
replied
celia
just
as
i
suppose
quite
so
just
that
we
sat
next
to
each
other
at
meals
do
you
know
where
his
cabin
was
on
the
steamer
yes
exactly
opposite
my
own
he
and
i
i
believe
were
the
only
passengers
who
had
cabins
all
to
ourselves
did
he
ever
mention
to
you
these
valuables
which
fullaway
tells
us
he
was
carrying
to
england
no
never
at
any
time
did
you
see
him
leave
the
for
the
shore
why
yes
certainly
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
and
i
came
ashore
at
hull
together
ahead
of
any
other
passengers
after
lisette
had
left
the
steamer
with
her
brother
i
happened
to
come
across
james
allerdyke
i
told
him
what
had
just
occurred
and
asked
him
if
he
would
help
me
about
my
things
as
my
maid
had
gone
he
immediately
suggested
that
we
should
wait
for
the
tender
but
should
get
a
boat
of
our
own
there
were
several
lying
around
he
said
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
ashore
because
he
a
friend
awaiting
him
at
the
station
hotel
so
he
got
a
boat
and
his
things
and
mine
were
put
into
it
and
we
left
the
steamer
and
were
rowed
to
the
just
opposite
and
you
of
course
carried
your
or
what
you
believed
to
be
your
the
duplicate
chest
which
you
subsequently
carried
to
edinburgh
yes
of
course
i
had
it
in
my
hand
when
lisette
left
and
i
never
left
hold
of
it
until
i
got
into
the
hotel
do
you
remember
if
james
allerdyke
carried
anything
in
his
hand
yes
he
carried
a
he
had
that
bag
in
his
hand
when
i
met
him
on
deck
he
kept
it
on
his
knee
in
the
boat
and
in
the
cab
in
which
we
drove
to
the
hotel
from
the
i
saw
him
carrying
it
upstairs
after
we
got
to
the
hotel
what
is
more
i
saw
him
bring
it
into
the
later
on
and
place
it
on
the
table
at
which
he
had
some
supper
i
saw
it
again
in
his
room
when
i
went
in
there
to
look
at
the
plans
of
the
norwegian
estate
which
he
had
told
me
about
he
did
take
those
plans
out
of
that
he
took
them
out
of
a
side
in
a
did
you
have
supper
with
him
that
night
no
i
was
sitting
at
another
table
talking
to
a
lady
who
had
been
with
us
on
the
a
lot
of
passengers
twenty
at
least
had
come
to
the
hotel
by
that
time
did
any
of
them
join
james
allerdyke
at
his
table
i
mean
i
do
remember
no
i
think
not
he
sat
at
a
table
one
end
of
which
adjoined
the
wall
he
put
the
at
that
end
i
remember
wondering
why
he
carried
his
bag
about
with
him
but
then
i
of
course
was
carrying
what
i
believed
to
be
my
did
you
see
him
talking
to
any
of
your
that
night
oh
yes
to
two
or
three
of
them
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
i
know
who
they
were
particularly
except
the
doctor
with
the
big
beard
i
saw
him
talking
to
allerdyke
at
the
door
of
the
had
you
taken
any
special
notice
of
your
fellow
passengers
on
board
the
no
not
at
all
they
were
just
the
usual
sort
of
passengers
i
interested
in
them
of
course
i
talked
to
some
of
them
in
the
ordinary
way
as
one
does
talk
on
board
ship
but
i
do
remember
anything
particular
about
them
nor
any
of
their
names
even
if
i
ever
knew
their
names
of
course
i
remember
james
allerdyke
name
because
of
the
business
talk
the
chief
who
had
been
making
shorthand
notes
of
this
conversation
paused
for
a
moment
evidently
considering
matters
and
then
turned
to
celia
with
a
smile
why
did
you
leave
the
hotel
at
hull
so
suddenly
he
asked
i
daresay
you
had
good
reasons
but
i
should
just
like
to
know
what
they
were
if
you
do
mind
i
no
reason
at
all
replied
celia
with
almost
blunt
directness
at
least
if
i
had
they
were
only
a
woman
reasons
i
was
a
bit
upset
at
being
left
alone
i
did
like
the
hotel
i
knew
i
should
sleep
it
was
a
most
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
i
suddenly
thought
i
like
to
go
motoring
i
knew
enough
of
the
geography
of
those
parts
to
know
if
i
motored
across
country
i
should
strike
the
great
northern
main
line
somewhere
and
catch
a
train
to
edinburgh
in
the
early
morning
so
i
just
cleared
out
ah
you
see
you
had
quite
a
number
of
reasons
said
the
chief
smiling
again
very
well
now
then
before
you
go
miss
lennard
i
want
you
to
do
just
one
thing
more
which
may
be
useful
to
us
in
our
work
he
turned
to
the
detective
get
those
things
he
said
quietly
bring
the
lot
in
here
celia
made
a
little
sound
of
distaste
as
the
detective
presently
returned
to
the
room
carrying
in
one
hand
a
brown
leather
and
in
the
other
a
cardboard
to
which
was
strapped
a
lined
with
fur
her
face
which
had
regained
its
colour
paled
again
lisette
things
she
muttered
oh
i
do
do
like
to
see
them
what
is
it
you
want
we
want
you
to
identify
them
and
if
you
will
to
look
them
over
replied
the
chief
the
cardboard
box
contains
everything
she
was
wearing
when
she
went
to
the
hotel
in
eastbourne
terrace
the
and
coat
are
what
she
took
in
with
her
spread
the
things
out
on
that
side
table
he
continued
turning
to
the
detective
let
miss
lennard
look
them
over
celia
performed
the
task
required
of
her
with
dislike
it
seemed
somehow
as
if
she
were
inspecting
the
dead
woman
afresh
she
hurried
over
the
task
all
these
things
are
hers
of
course
she
said
that
the
she
had
with
her
when
she
left
me
at
hull
and
that
the
coat
i
gave
her
and
the
other
things
are
hers
too
oh
i
do
like
looking
at
them
ca
we
go
please
one
moment
said
the
chief
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
amongst
all
these
things
there
is
nothing
that
establishes
the
woman
identity
i
mean
in
the
way
of
papers
or
anything
of
that
sort
there
were
no
letters
in
this
case
not
a
scrap
of
paper
there
is
money
in
that
purse
two
or
three
pounds
in
gold
some
silver
there
is
her
watch
a
good
gold
watch
and
there
are
two
or
three
rings
she
was
wearing
now
we
have
only
made
a
superficial
examination
of
all
these
personal
belongings
can
you
as
her
mistress
suggest
if
she
was
likely
to
hide
anything
in
her
clothing
and
if
so
in
what
article
you
might
save
us
some
trouble
miss
lennard
allerdyke
who
was
more
interested
in
celia
than
in
what
was
going
on
saw
a
sudden
gleam
come
into
her
eyes
her
feminine
spirit
of
curiosity
was
aroused
she
hesitated
turned
back
to
the
paused
before
the
various
articles
laid
out
there
took
up
and
fingered
two
or
three
and
suddenly
wheeled
round
on
the
men
exhibiting
a
quilted
handkerchief
case
there
something
been
sewn
into
the
padding
of
this
she
said
i
can
feel
it
can
any
one
lend
me
or
a
penknife
the
men
gathered
round
as
celia
deft
fingers
ripped
open
the
satin
covering
a
moment
later
she
drew
out
a
wad
of
folded
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
chief
fullaway
and
allerdyke
craned
their
necks
over
his
shoulders
as
he
unwrapped
and
spread
the
bits
of
paper
out
before
them
and
it
was
fullaway
who
broke
the
silence
with
a
sharp
exclamation
he
said
russian
and
new
ones
chapter
xii
the
third
murder
fullaway
exclamation
was
followed
by
a
murmur
of
astonishment
from
celia
and
by
a
low
growl
which
meant
many
things
from
allerdyke
the
chief
turned
the
banknotes
over
silently
moved
to
his
desk
and
picked
up
a
reference
book
i
not
very
familiar
with
russian
money
paper
or
otherwise
he
remarked
how
much
does
this
represent
in
ours
now
i
can
tell
you
that
said
fullaway
taking
the
wad
of
notes
and
rapidly
counting
them
five
hundred
pounds
english
he
announced
and
you
see
that
all
the
notes
are
new
do
forget
to
note
that
yes
what
do
you
argue
from
it
asked
the
chief
with
obvious
interest
it
proves
what
that
these
notes
were
given
to
this
woman
in
russia
recently
most
likely
in
petersburg
replied
the
american
and
in
my
opinion
their
presence
their
discovery
proves
more
it
suggests
at
any
rate
that
this
woman
the
dead
maid
was
a
tool
in
the
conspiracy
to
rob
miss
lennard
and
james
allerdyke
that
this
money
is
her
reward
or
part
of
it
and
that
the
whole
scheme
was
hatched
and
engineered
in
russia
good
muttered
allerdyke
now
we
getting
to
business
we
shall
have
to
get
some
evidence
from
russia
observed
the
chief
meditatively
that
very
evident
if
the
thing
began
there
or
was
put
into
active
shape
there
the
princess
nastirsevitch
is
on
her
way
now
said
fullaway
he
pulled
out
his
and
began
searching
amongst
its
papers
here
you
are
he
continued
producing
a
cablegram
that
from
the
princess
you
see
she
says
she
leaving
for
london
at
once
via
berlin
and
calais
and
will
call
upon
me
at
my
hotel
as
soon
as
she
arrives
now
that
was
sent
off
two
days
ago
she
leave
petersburg
that
night
it
hours
journey
three
days
she
be
in
london
tomorrow
evening
the
chief
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
picked
up
a
pen
give
me
your
addresses
please
all
of
you
he
said
then
i
can
communicate
with
you
at
any
moment
miss
lennard
you
mentioned
bedford
court
mansions
what
number
yours
fullaway
is
the
waldorf
hotel
permanently
there
very
good
you
allerdyke
live
in
bradford
it
will
be
advisable
if
you
really
want
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
your
cousin
death
to
remain
in
town
for
a
few
days
at
any
rate
now
that
we
got
all
this
in
hand
you
better
be
close
to
the
centre
of
things
can
you
give
me
an
address
here
i
a
london
office
answered
allerdyke
i
can
always
be
heard
of
there
when
i
in
town
allerdyke
and
partners
limited
gresham
street
ask
for
marshall
allerdyke
but
as
i
have
to
put
up
here
i
go
to
the
waldorf
with
fullaway
so
if
you
want
me
you
find
me
there
and
look
here
he
went
on
as
the
chief
noted
these
particulars
i
want
to
know
to
have
some
idea
you
know
of
going
to
be
done
i
tell
you
i
spare
no
time
labour
or
expense
in
getting
at
the
bottom
of
this
if
it
a
question
of
money
say
the
word
and
all
right
allerdyke
leave
it
to
us
for
the
present
said
the
chief
with
an
understanding
smile
i
know
what
you
mean
we
only
beginning
this
affair
is
doubtless
a
big
thing
as
fullaway
has
suggested
and
it
will
need
some
clever
work
now
at
present
this
case
the
joint
case
of
the
hull
affair
and
the
eastbourne
terrace
affair
for
they
without
doubt
both
parts
of
one
serious
whole
is
in
the
hands
of
two
of
my
best
men
this
is
one
of
them
blindway
if
and
when
blindway
wants
any
of
you
he
come
to
you
miss
lennard
you
be
wanted
at
the
inquest
on
your
late
maid
the
officer
will
let
you
know
when
you
two
gentlemen
will
doubtless
go
with
miss
lennard
you
all
three
certainly
be
wanted
at
that
adjourned
inquest
at
hull
now
that
all
except
that
when
you
miss
lennard
return
home
you
must
at
once
begin
searching
for
the
references
you
had
with
your
maid
let
me
have
them
as
soon
as
they
found
and
that
you
fullaway
must
bring
the
princess
nastirsevitch
here
as
soon
as
you
can
after
her
arrival
outside
new
scotland
yard
celia
lennard
relieved
her
feelings
with
a
fervent
exclamation
i
wish
i
never
spent
a
penny
on
pearls
or
diamonds
in
my
life
she
said
vehemently
insane
folly
what
good
have
they
done
leading
to
all
this
bother
and
to
murder
what
fools
women
are
all
that
money
thrown
away
for
of
course
i
shall
never
see
a
sign
of
them
again
that
a
rather
hopeless
way
of
looking
at
it
observed
fullaway
you
got
the
cleverest
police
in
europe
on
the
search
for
them
also
you
got
our
friend
allerdyke
and
myself
on
the
run
and
neither
of
us
exactly
brainless
so
hasten
home
in
this
get
some
lunch
have
an
hour
nap
and
then
begin
putting
your
papers
straight
and
looking
for
those
references
search
well
you
do
know
what
depends
on
it
he
and
allerdyke
strolled
up
whitehall
when
celia
had
gone
in
silence
at
first
both
wrapped
in
meditation
there
only
one
thing
one
can
say
with
any
certainty
about
this
affair
allerdyke
remarked
the
american
at
last
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
man
we
been
talking
to
said
it
a
big
do
the
folk
at
the
back
of
it
are
smart
and
clever
and
daring
we
need
all
our
wits
well
come
along
to
the
waldorf
and
let
lunch
then
we
talk
some
more
there
little
to
be
done
till
the
princess
turns
up
tomorrow
there
one
thing
i
want
to
do
at
once
said
allerdyke
if
i
going
to
stop
in
town
i
must
wire
to
my
housekeeper
to
send
me
clothes
and
linen
and
to
the
manager
at
my
mill
then
i
with
you
and
i
wish
to
heaven
we
something
to
do
what
i
ca
stand
is
this
forced
inaction
this
hanging
about
waiting
wondering
speculating
and
doing
naught
we
may
be
in
action
before
you
know
it
at
hand
said
fullaway
in
these
cases
you
never
know
what
a
minute
may
bring
forth
all
we
can
do
is
to
be
ready
he
led
the
way
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
and
waited
while
allerdyke
sent
off
his
messages
the
performance
of
even
this
small
task
seemed
to
restore
the
yorkshireman
spirits
he
came
away
smiling
i
told
my
housekeeper
to
pack
a
couple
of
trunks
with
what
i
want
and
to
send
my
chauffeur
gaffney
up
with
them
by
the
next
express
he
said
i
feel
better
after
doing
that
he
a
smart
chap
gaffney
the
sort
that
might
be
useful
at
a
pinch
if
any
one
wanted
anything
ferreted
out
now
he
the
sense
of
an
airedale
terrier
that
chap
high
praise
laughed
fullaway
and
original
too
well
let
fix
up
and
get
some
food
and
then
we
go
into
my
private
rooms
and
have
a
talk
over
the
situation
franklin
fullaway
following
a
certain
modern
fashion
introduced
into
life
by
company
promoters
and
magnates
of
the
high
finance
had
established
his
business
quarters
at
his
hotel
it
was
a
wise
and
pleasant
thing
to
do
he
explained
to
allerdyke
you
had
the
advantage
of
living
over
the
shop
as
it
were
of
being
able
to
go
out
of
your
private
into
your
business
office
you
had
the
bright
and
pleasant
surroundings
you
had
moreover
all
the
various
rooms
and
saloons
of
a
hotel
wherein
to
entertain
your
clients
if
need
be
certainly
you
had
to
pay
for
these
advantages
and
luxuries
but
no
more
than
you
would
have
to
lay
out
in
the
rents
rates
and
taxes
of
palatial
offices
in
a
business
quarter
and
my
line
of
business
demands
luxurious
fittings
remarked
the
american
as
he
installed
allerdyke
in
a
sybaritic
armchair
and
handed
him
a
box
of
big
cigars
of
a
famous
brand
you
not
the
first
millionaire
that
come
to
anchor
in
that
chair
you
know
if
they
millionaires
in
maybe
not
answered
allerdyke
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
glanced
appraisingly
at
his
surroundings
at
the
thick
velvet
pile
of
the
carpets
the
fine
furniture
the
bookcases
filled
with
beautiful
bindings
the
choice
bits
of
statuary
the
two
or
three
unmistakably
good
pictures
doing
good
business
i
reckon
he
said
with
true
yorkshire
curiosity
what
it
run
to
now
fullaway
showed
his
fine
white
teeth
in
a
genial
laugh
oh
i
turned
over
two
and
three
millions
in
a
year
in
this
little
den
he
answered
cheerily
varies
you
know
according
to
what
people
have
got
to
sell
and
what
good
buyers
there
are
knocking
around
you
keep
a
bit
of
sealing
wax
of
course
suggested
allerdyke
take
care
that
some
of
the
brass
sticks
when
you
handle
it
no
doubt
commission
and
percentage
of
course
responded
fullaway
ah
well
you
an
advantage
over
chaps
like
me
said
allerdyke
now
you
shall
take
my
case
we
made
a
pile
of
money
in
our
firm
grandfather
father
and
myself
but
lord
man
you
would
believe
what
our
expenses
have
been
building
mills
fitting
machinery
and
then
wages
why
i
pay
wages
to
six
hundred
workpeople
every
friday
afternoon
our
wages
bill
runs
to
well
over
fourteen
hundred
pound
a
week
naught
of
that
sort
of
course
no
great
staff
to
keep
up
no
answered
fullaway
he
nodded
his
head
towards
the
door
of
a
room
through
which
they
had
just
passed
on
their
way
into
the
agent
private
apartments
all
the
staff
i
have
is
the
young
lady
you
just
saw
marlow
invaluable
married
woman
inquired
allerdyke
laconically
young
widow
answered
fullaway
just
as
tersely
excellent
business
woman
been
with
me
ever
since
i
came
here
three
years
speaks
and
writes
several
languages

i
knew
her
people
very
well
of
course
i
do
require
much
assistance
merely
clerical
help
but
it
got
to
be
of
a
highly
intelligent
and
specialized
sort
leave
your
business
in
her
hands
if
need
be
i
reckon
suggested
allerdyke
with
a
sidelong
nod
at
the
closed
door
in
ordinary
matters
yes
comfortably
answered
fullaway
she
a
bit
a
specialist
in
two
things
that
i
mainly
concerned
in
pictures
and
diamonds
she
can
tell
a
genuine
old
master
at
a
glance
and
she
knows
a
lot
about
diamonds
her
father
was
in
that
trade
at
one
time
out
in
south
africa
clever
woman
to
have
observed
allerdyke
knows
all
your
business
of
course
all
the
surface
business
said
fullaway
naturally
anything
but
a
confidential
secretary
would
be
useless
to
me
you
know
just
so
agreed
allerdyke
told
her
about
this
affair
yet
i
had
no
chance
so
far
replied
fullaway
i
shall
take
her
advice
about
it
she
a
cute
woman
sure
enough
said
allerdyke
he
let
his
mind
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
picture
which
marlow
had
made
as
fullaway
led
him
through
the
office
a
very
pretty
alert
piquant
little
woman
still
on
the
sunny
side
of
thirty
who
had
given
him
a
sharp
glance
out
of
unusually
eyes
aye
women
are
clever
nowadays
no
doubt
they
show
their
grandmothers
how
to
suck
eggs
in
a
good
many
new
fashions
well
now
he
went
on
stretching
his
long
legs
over
fullaway
beautiful
persian
rug
what
do
you
make
of
this
affair
fullaway
in
its
present
situation
there
no
doubt
that
considerably
altered
by
what
we
heard
of
this
morning
do
you
really
think
that
this
french
maid
affair
is
all
of
a
piece
as
one
may
term
it
with
the
affair
of
my
cousin
james
yes
without
doubt
replied
fullaway
i
believe
the
two
affairs
all
spring
from
the
same
plot
that
plot
in
my
opinion
has
originated
from
a
clever
gang
who
somehow
or
other
got
to
know
that
james
allerdyke
was
bringing
over
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
and
who
also
turned
their
eyes
on
zélie
de
longarde
valuables
the
french
maid
lisette
was
probably
nothing
but
a
tool
a
cat
paw
and
she
having
done
her
work
has
been
cleverly
removed
so
that
she
could
never
split
further
a
quiet
knock
at
the
door
just
then
prefaced
the
entrance
of
marlow
who
gave
her
employer
an
inquiring
glance
blindway
to
see
you
she
announced
shall
i
show
him
in
at
once
replied
fullaway
he
leapt
from
his
chair
and
going
to
the
door
called
to
the
detective
to
enter
news
he
asked
excitedly
when
marlow
had
retired
closing
the
door
again
what
is
it
important
the
detective
who
looked
very
solemn
drew
a
from
his
pocket
and
slowly
produced
a
telegram
important
enough
he
answered
this
case
is
assuming
a
very
strange
complexion
gentlemen
this
arrived
from
hull
half
an
hour
ago
and
the
chief
thought
i
better
bring
it
on
to
you
at
once
you
see
what
it
is
he
held
the
telegram
out
to
both
men
and
they
read
it
together
fullaway
muttering
the
words
as
he
read
from
constable
hull
to
superintendent
new
scotland
lydenberg
concerned
in
allerdyke
case
was
shot
dead
in
high
street
here
this
morning
by
unseen
person
who
is
up
to
now
unarrested
and
to
whose
identity
we
have
no
clue
chapter
xiii
ambler
appleyard
fullaway
laid
the
telegram
down
on
his
table
and
looked
from
it
to
the
detective
shot
dead
high
street
this
morning
he
said
wonderingly
why
that
means
of
course
in
broad
daylight
in
a
busy
street
i
suppose
and
yet
no
clue
how
could
a
man
be
shot
dead
under
such
circumstances
without
the
murderer
being
seen
and
followed
you
do
know
hull
very
well
remarked
allerdyke
who
had
been
pulling
his
moustache
and
frowning
over
the
telegram
else
you
know
how
that
could
be
done
easy
enough
in
high
street
high
street
he
went
on
turning
to
the
detective
is
the
oldest
street
in
the
town
it
the
old
merchant
street
half
of
it
lower
end
is
more
or
less
in
ruins
there
are
old
houses
there
which
are
tenanted
back
of
these
houses
are
courts
and
alleys
and
queer
entries
leading
on
one
side
to
the
river
and
on
the
other
to
side
streets
a
man
could
be
lured
into
one
of
those
places
and
put
out
of
the
way
easily
and
quietly
enough
or
he
could
be
shot
by
anybody
lurking
in
one
of
those
houses
and
the
murderer
could
be
got
away
unobserved
with
the
greatest
ease
that
probably
happened
i
know
that
street
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
house
i
not
surprised
by
that
what
i
surprised
about
is
to
hear
that
lydenberg
has
been
shot
at
all
and
the
question
is
is
his
murder
of
a
piece
with
all
the
rest
of
this
damnable
mystery
or
is
it
clean
apart
from
it
understand
fullaway
i
thinking
answered
the
american
it
takes
a
lot
of
thinking
too
you
see
continued
allerdyke
turning
to
blindway
again
we
all
in
a
hole
in
a
regular
fog
we
know
naught
literally
naught
this
lydenberg
was
a
foreigner
swede
norwegian
dane
or
something
we
know
nothing
of
him
except
that
he
said
he
come
to
hull
on
business
he
may
have
been
shot
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
private
political
we
do
know
but
mark
me
if
his
murder
connected
with
the
others
if
it
all
of
a
piece
with
my
cousin
murder
and
that
french
girl
why
then
he
paused
shaking
his
head
emphatically
and
the
other
two
impressed
by
his
earnestness
waited
until
he
spoke
again
then
he
continued
at
last
after
a
space
of
silence
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
reflecting
with
added
strenuousness
then
by
heaven
up
against
something
that
going
to
take
it
out
of
us
before
we
get
at
the
truth
that
a
dead
certainty
if
this
is
all
conspiracy
it
a
big
a
colossal
thing
what
say
fullaway
i
should
say
you
right
replied
fullaway
i
been
trying
to
figure
things
up
while
you
talked
though
i
gave
you
both
ears
it
looks
as
if
this
lydenberg
had
been
shot
in
order
to
keep
his
tongue
quiet
forever
maybe
he
knew
something
and
was
likely
to
split
what
are
your
people
going
to
do
about
this
he
asked
turning
to
the
detective
i
suppose
you
go
down
to
hull
at
once
i
sha
answered
blindway
i
enough
to
do
here
one
of
our
men
has
already
gone
he
on
his
way
we
shall
have
to
wait
for
news
inclined
to
agree
with
allerdyke
it
a
big
thing
a
very
big
thing
if
allerdyke
cousin
was
really
murdered
and
if
the
death
arose
out
of
that
and
now
lydenberg
there
a
clever
combination
at
work
and
where
the
least
clue
to
it
allerdyke
helped
himself
to
a
fresh
cigar
out
of
a
box
which
lay
on
fullaway
table
lighted
it
and
smoked
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
the
other
men
feeling
instinctively
that
he
was
thinking
waited
look
you
here
he
exclaimed
suddenly
clue
yes
that
what
we
want
where
that
clue
likely
to
be
found
why
in
this
and
this
only
who
knew
person
or
persons
that
my
cousin
was
bringing
those
jewels
from
the
princess
nastirsevitch
to
this
country
get
to
know
that
and
it
narrows
the
field
d
see
there
the
question
of
miss
lennard
jewels
too
remarked
fullaway
that
may
be
perhaps
was
a
said
allerdyke
it
may
have
come
into
the
big
scheme
as
an
but
anyway
that
what
we
want
a
first
clue
and
i
do
see
how
that
to
be
got
at
until
this
princess
arrives
here
you
see
she
may
have
talked
she
may
have
let
it
out
in
confidence
to
somebody
who
abused
her
confidence
what
is
certain
is
that
somebody
must
have
got
to
know
of
this
proposed
deal
between
the
princess
and
your
man
fullaway
and
have
laid
plans
accordingly
to
rob
the
princess
messenger
my
cousin
james
d
see
the
deal
was
known
of
at
two
ends
to
you
here
to
this
princess
through
james
over
there
in
russia
now
then
where
did
the
secret
get
out
did
it
get
out
there
or
here
not
here
of
course
answered
fullaway
with
emphasis
that
dead
sure
over
there
of
a
certainty
the
robbery
was
engineered
from
there
then
in
that
case
there
naught
to
do
but
wait
the
arrival
of
the
princess
said
allerdyke
and
you
say
she
be
here
night
in
the
meantime
no
doubt
you
police
gentlemen
get
more
news
about
this
last
affair
at
hull
and
perhaps
miss
lennard
find
those
references
about
the
frenchwoman
and
maybe
we
shall
mop
things
up
bit
by
bit
for
mopped
up
they
have
to
be
or
my
name
is
what
it
is
fullaway
he
went
on
rising
from
his
chair
i
have
to
leave
you
yon
man
mine
be
arriving
from
yorkshire
with
my
things
before
long
and
i
must
go
down
to
the
hotel
office
and
make
arrangements
about
him
see
you
later
at
dinner
here
eh
he
lounged
away
through
the
outer
office
giving
the
smart
lady
secretary
a
keen
glance
as
he
passed
her
and
getting
an
equally
scrutinizing
if
swift
look
in
return
clever
mused
allerdyke
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
deuced
clever
that
young
woman
um
well
it
a
pretty
coil
to
be
sure
he
went
down
to
the
office
made
full
and
precise
arrangements
about
gaffney
who
was
to
be
given
a
room
close
to
his
own
left
some
instructions
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
him
on
arrival
and
then
hands
in
pockets
strolled
out
into
aldwych
and
walked
towards
the
strand
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
as
if
he
strove
to
find
in
those
hard
pavements
some
solution
of
all
these
difficulties
and
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
and
muttered
a
few
emphatic
words
half
aloud
regardless
of
whoever
might
overhear
them
i
wish
to
heaven
i
a
right
good
yorkshireman
to
talk
to
he
said
a
chap
with
some
gumption
about
him
these
cockneys
and
americans
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
then
he
pulled
himself
up
sharply
an
idea
a
name
had
flashed
into
his
mental
field
of
vision
as
if
sent
in
answer
to
his
prayer
and
still
regardless
of
bystanders
he
slapped
his
thigh
delightedly
ambler
appleyard
he
exclaimed
the
very
man
here
you
the
last
two
words
were
addressed
to
a
driver
whose
car
stood
at
the
head
of
the
line
by
the
gaiety
theatre
allerdyke
crossed
from
the
pavement
and
jumped
in
run
down
to
this
end
of
gresham
street
he
said
go
quick
as
you
can
he
wondered
as
he
sped
along
the
crowded
london
streets
why
he
had
not
thought
of
ambler
appleyard
before
ambler
appleyard
was
the
manager
of
his
own
london
warehouse
a
smart
clever
pushing
young
bradford
man
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
london
business
of
allerdyke
and
partners
limited
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
come
to
london
with
his
brains
already
sharpened
three
years
of
business
life
in
the
metropolis
had
made
them
all
the
sharper
allerdyke
rubbed
his
hands
with
satisfaction
exchange
of
confidence
with
a
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
he
got
out
of
his
cab
at
the
aldersgate
end
of
gresham
street
and
walked
quickly
along
until
he
came
to
a
highly
polished
brass
plate
on
which
his
own
name
was
deeply
engraven
running
up
a
few
steps
into
a
warehouse
stored
with
neat
packages
of
dress
goods
he
encountered
a
couple
of
warehousemen
engaged
in
sorting
and
classifying
a
consignment
of
fabrics
just
arrived
from
bradford
allerdyke
whose
visits
to
his
london
warehouse
were
fairly
frequent
and
usually
without
notice
nodded
affably
to
both
and
walked
across
the
floor
to
an
inner
office
he
opened
the
door
without
ceremony
closed
it
carefully
behind
him
and
stepping
forward
to
the
occupant
of
the
room
who
sat
busily
writing
at
a
desk
with
his
back
to
the
entrant
and
continued
to
write
without
moving
or
looking
round
gave
him
a
resounding
smack
on
the
shoulder
the
very
man
i
want
ambler
my
lad
he
said
sit
up
ambler
appleyard
raised
his
head
slowly
twisted
in
his
revolving
chair
and
looked
quietly
at
his
employer
and
allerdyke
dropping
into
an
by
the
fireplace
over
which
hung
a
fine
steel
engraving
of
himself
flanked
by
photographs
of
the
bradford
mills
and
the
bradford
warehouse
looked
at
his
london
manager
secretly
admiring
the
shrewdness
and
evidenced
in
the
young
man
face
appleyard
was
certainly
no
beauty
his
outstanding
features
were
hair
freckled
cheeks
a
snub
nose
and
a
decidedly
wide
mouth
moreover
his
ears
unusually
large
stood
out
from
the
sides
of
his
head
in
very
prominent
fashion
and
gave
a
beholder
the
impression
that
they
were
perpetually
stretched
to
attention
but
he
was
the
owner
of
a
forehead
a
pair
of
steady
and
honest
blue
eyes
and
a
firmly
cut
square
chin
and
his
entire
atmosphere
conveyed
the
idea
of
capacity
resource
and
energy
it
pleased
allerdyke
too
to
see
that
the
young
man
was
attentive
to
his
own
personal
appearance
his
garments
bore
the
undoubted
stamp
of
the
savile
row
tailor
the
silk
hat
which
covered
his
crop
of
sandy
hair
was
the
latest
thing
in
sackville
street
headgear
from
top
to
toe
he
was
the
smart
and
that
was
the
sort
of
man
marshall
allerdyke
liked
to
have
about
him
and
to
see
as
heads
of
his
departments
not
fops
nor
dandies
but
men
who
knew
the
commercial
value
of
good
appearance
and
smart
finish
i
did
know
you
were
in
town
allerdyke
said
the
london
manager
quietly
still
one
never
knows
where
you
are
these
days
i
scarcely
known
that
myself
my
lad
these
last
hours
replied
allerdyke
you
might
think
it
but
at
this
time
yesterday
i
was
going
full
tilt
up
to
edinburgh
i
want
to
tell
you
about
that
ambler
i
want
some
advice
but
business
first
aught
new
i
brought
that
south
american
contract
off
replied
appleyard
fixed
it
this
morning
good
said
allerdyke
what
it
run
to
like
thousand
answered
appleyard
nice
bit
of
profit
on
that
mr
allerdyke
good
good
repeated
allerdyke
aught
else
naught
at
present
naught
out
of
the
usual
anyway
said
the
manager
he
took
off
his
hat
laid
aside
the
papers
he
had
been
busy
with
on
allerdyke
entrance
and
twisted
his
chair
round
to
the
hearth
this
advice
then
he
asked
quietly
i
free
now
aye
said
allerdyke
he
sat
reflecting
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
his
manager
with
a
sudden
question
have
you
heard
all
this
about
my
cousin
james
he
asked
with
sharp
directness
appleyard
lifted
a
couple
of
newspapers
from
his
desk
no
more
than
what
in
these
he
answered
one
tells
of
his
sudden
death
at
hull
the
other
begins
to
hint
that
there
was
something
queer
about
it
queer
exclaimed
allerdyke
aye
and
more
than
queer
my
lad
our
james
was
murdered
now
then
ambler
i
come
here
to
tell
you
all
the
story
you
must
listen
to
every
detail
i
know
your
brains
keep
fixed
on
what
i
going
to
tell
hear
it
all
weigh
it
up
and
then
tell
me
what
you
make
of
it
for
i
damned
if
i
can
make
either
head
or
tail
back
side
or
front
of
the
whole
thing
so
far
happen
you
can
see
a
bit
of
light
listen
now
allerdyke
from
long
training
in
business
habits
was
a
good
teller
of
a
plain
and
straightforward
tale
appleyard
for
the
same
reason
was
a
good
listener
so
one
man
talked
in
low
earnest
tones
checking
off
his
points
as
he
made
them
taking
care
that
he
emphasized
the
principal
items
of
his
news
and
dwelt
lightly
on
the
connecting
links
and
the
other
listened
in
silence
keeping
a
concentrated
attention
and
storing
away
the
facts
in
his
memory
as
they
were
duly
marshalled
before
him
for
a
good
hour
one
brain
gave
out
and
the
other
took
in
and
without
waste
of
words
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
master
looked
at
man
well
said
allerdyke
after
a
silence
that
was
full
of
meaning
well
take
some
thinking
about
answered
appleyard
tersely
it
a
big
thing
a
devilish
clever
thing
too
there
one
fact
strikes
me
at
once
though
the
news
about
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
leaked
out
somewhere
allerdyke
that
certain
either
here
in
london
or
over
there
in
russia
it
leaked
out
now
until
this
princess
comes
you
no
means
of
knowing
if
the
leakage
was
over
yonder
but
there
one
thing
you
do
know
now
at
this
very
minute
there
were
three
people
here
in
england
who
knew
that
the
jewels
were
on
the
way
from
russia
in
james
allerdyke
charge
those
three
were
this
man
fullaway
his
lady
secretary
and
delkin
the
chicago
millionaire
now
then
allerdyke
how
much
or
what
do
you
know
about
any
one
of
chapter
xiv
fifty
thousand
pounds
reward
allerdyke
encountered
this
direct
question
with
a
long
fixed
stare
of
growing
comprehension
his
silence
showed
that
he
was
gradually
taking
in
its
significance
aye
just
so
he
said
at
last
just
so
how
much
do
i
know
of
any
of
well
of
fullaway
no
more
than
i
seen
of
his
secretary
no
more
than
what
i
seen
and
heard
of
delkin
no
more
than
that
such
a
man
exists
sum
total
what
next
to
naught
said
appleyard
in
a
case
like
this
you
ought
to
know
more
fullaway
may
be
all
right
fullaway
may
be
all
wrong
his
lady
secretary
may
be
as
right
as
he
is
or
as
wrong
as
he
is
as
to
delkin
he
might
be
a
creature
of
fullaway
imagination
put
it
all
to
yourself
now
allerdyke
on
the
face
of
what
you
told
me
these
three
people
two
of
at
any
rate
for
a
certainty
knew
about
these
valuables
coming
over
in
james
charge
so
far
as
you
know
your
cousin
had
when
he
left
christiania
and
reached
hull
there
they
disappear
so
far
as
you
aware
nobody
but
these
people
knew
of
their
coming
no
other
people
in
england
knew
at
any
rate
so
far
i
repeat
as
your
knowledge
goes
i
should
want
to
know
something
about
these
three
if
i
were
in
your
place
mr
allerdyke
aye
aye
replied
allerdyke
i
see
your
point
well
i
been
in
fullaway
company
now
for
two
days
there
no
denying
he
a
smart
chap
a
clever
chap
and
he
seems
to
be
doing
good
business
moreover
ambler
my
lad
james
knew
him
and
james
was
the
sort
to
take
up
with
wrong
as
to
the
secretary
i
ca
say
besides
fullaway
said
this
afternoon
that
he
had
told
her
all
about
it
yet
all
about
the
hull
affair
and
the
lennard
affair
i
took
that
to
mean
from
your
account
remarked
appleyard
if
she
his
confidential
secretary
with
access
to
his
papers
and
business
she
know
all
about
the
princess
transaction
now
of
course
an
inquiry
or
two
of
the
usual
sort
would
satisfy
you
about
fullaway
i
mean
as
a
business
man
an
inquiry
or
two
would
tell
you
all
about
delkin
but
you
ca
get
to
know
all
about
marlow
from
any
inquiry
and
you
ca
find
out
all
about
fullaway
from
any
inquiry
he
may
be
the
straightest
business
man
in
all
london
and
yet
have
a
finger
in
this
pie
and
his
secretary
with
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewels
allerdyke
is
a
temptation
and
these
folks
knew
the
jewels
were
on
the
way
what
more
they
time
to
intercept
their
bearer
mr
james
allerdyke
rubbed
his
chin
and
knitted
his
brows
in
obvious
bewilderment
there
must
ha
been
more
than
them
in
at
it
he
said
musingly
a
regular
gang
of
judging
by
results
every
gang
has
its
ganger
replied
appleyard
with
a
knowing
smile
there
no
doubt
this
is
a
big
thing
but
there
must
be
a
central
point
a
head
a
controlling
authority
in
it
we
come
back
you
see
after
all
to
where
we
started
these
people
were
the
only
people
in
england
who
knew
about
these
jewels
so
far
as
we
know
aye
but
only
so
far
as
we
know
said
allerdyke
there
may
have
been
others
there
may
have
been
folks
who
got
to
know
about
them
over
there
in
russia
and
who
communicated
their
knowledge
to
some
folks
here
and
there
always
this
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
affair
the
plot
may
have
been
originated
there
and
worked
from
there
remember
that
quite
so
and
you
ca
decide
on
anything
relating
to
that
until
this
princess
comes
agreed
appleyard
it
have
to
rest
till
you
heard
all
she
has
to
say
and
then
you
know
where
you
are
but
in
the
meantime
you
can
find
out
a
bit
about
fullaway
and
this
millionaire
man
i
can
find
out
for
you
if
you
like
in
a
few
hours
do
my
lad
said
allerdyke
it
always
well
to
know
who
dealing
with
aye
make
an
inquiry
or
two
but
remember
that
all
i
can
inquire
about
will
be
in
the
ordinary
business
way
continued
appleyard
i
can
ascertain
if
there
is
a
delkin
in
town
who
a
chicago
millionaire
and
if
fullaway
a
reputable
business
man
but
that
be
all
as
to
the
secretary
i
ca
do
anything
i
keep
an
eye
on
her
myself
said
allerdyke
well
do
this
then
and
let
me
know
the
results
i
put
up
at
the
waldorf
and
there
i
shall
stop
while
all
this
is
being
investigated
here
in
london
but
i
shall
pop
in
and
out
here
of
course
and
now
i
go
back
there
and
find
out
if
there
any
fresh
news
from
the
police
or
from
hull
i
reckon
there
be
some
fine
reading
in
the
newspapers
in
a
day
or
two
ambler
it
all
have
to
come
out
now
in
this
supposition
allerdyke
was
right
the
police
authorities
finding
that
the
affair
had
assumed
dimensions
of
an
astonishing
magnitude
decided
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
press
and
to
publish
the
entire
story
in
the
fullest
possible
fashion
and
allerdyke
and
all
london
woke
next
morning
to
find
the
newspapers
alive
with
a
new
sensation
and
every
other
man
asking
his
neighbour
what
it
all
meant
three
mysterious
murders
two
big
thefts
together
the
newspaper
world
had
known
nothing
like
it
for
years
and
the
only
regrets
in
fleet
street
were
those
of
the
men
who
would
have
sacrificed
their
very
noses
to
have
got
the
story
exclusively
to
themselves
but
the
police
authorities
had
exercised
a
wise
generosity
and
no
one
newspaper
knew
more
than
another
at
that
stage
they
all
as
fullaway
said
to
allerdyke
at
breakfast
got
a
fair
start
and
from
that
one
could
run
their
own
race
we
shall
be
to
these
pressmen
as
a
pot
of
honey
to
flies
he
observed
take
my
advice
allerdyke
see
none
of
them
and
if
you
should
as
you
will
get
buttonholed
and
held
up
refuse
to
say
a
word
you
can
leave
that
to
me
answered
allerdyke
with
a
twitch
of
his
determined
jaw
it
be
a
clever
newspaper
chap
that
would
get
aught
out
of
me
i
other
fish
to
fry
than
to
talk
to
these
gentry
and
what
good
will
all
this
newspaper
stuff
do
lots
replied
fullaway
it
will
draw
attention
there
already
be
a
few
thousand
amateur
detectives
looking
out
for
the
man
who
left
the
french
maid
dead
in
eastbourne
terrace
and
a
few
hundred
amateur
criminologists
racking
their
brains
for
a
plausible
theory
of
the
whole
thing
oh
yes
it
a
good
thing
to
arouse
public
interest
allerdyke
all
that
wanted
now
is
a
rousing
reward
have
you
thought
of
that
did
i
mention
it
to
the
man
at
scotland
yard
yesterday
said
allerdyke
i
game
to
find
aught
reasonable
in
the
way
of
brass
but
he
added
with
a
touch
of
true
yorkshire
caution
i
been
thinking
that
over
during
the
night
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
other
parties
who
ought
to
come
in
at
it
with
me
of
course
miss
lennard
and
the
princess
d
see
if
they
willing
i
am
you
mean
a
joint
reward
for
the
detection
of
the
murderer
and
the
recovery
of
the
jewels
suggested
fullaway
well
you
can
be
pretty
certain
by
now
that
the
murders
and
the
thefts
are
all
the
work
of
one
gang
replied
allerdyke
so
it
long
as
short
these
two
women
want
their
pearls
and
their
diamonds
back
i
want
to
know
who
killed
my
cousin
james
we
all
three
in
the
same
boat
really
so
if
we
make
up
a
good
substantial
purse
between
us
what
good
agreed
fullaway
we
hear
what
the
princess
says
when
she
arrives
i
guess
we
shall
all
know
better
where
we
exactly
are
when
we
heard
what
she
has
to
say
if
she
like
most
women
that
lost
aught
in
the
way
of
finery
remarked
allerdyke
drily
she
have
plenty
to
say
that
night
he
had
abundant
opportunity
of
hearing
the
princess
nastirsevitch
views
on
the
situation
freely
expressed
he
himself
fetched
celia
lennard
to
the
conference
at
new
scotland
yard
they
found
fullaway
and
the
princess
already
there
in
full
blast
of
debate
allerdyke
inspected
the
new
arrival
with
keen
interest
and
found
her
a
handsome
woman
of
sharp
smart
and
american
to
the
the
official
whom
they
had
met
before
was
already
questioning
her
and
for
allerdyke
benefit
he
repeated
what
had
already
transpired
the
princess
affirms
allerdyke
that
not
a
soul
but
herself
and
your
cousin
james
allerdyke
knew
of
this
affair
he
said
i
am
right
am
i
not
madame
he
went
on
turning
to
the
princess
in
saying
that
not
one
word
of
this
transaction
or
proposed
transaction
was
ever
mentioned
by
you
to
any
person
but
james
allerdyke
to
no
other
person
than
james
allerdyke
assented
the
princess
firmly
it
would
have
been
strange
conduct
on
my
part
i
think
if
i
had
told
anybody
else
anything
about
it
my
object
of
course
being
secrecy
from
the
moment
i
first
mentioned
it
to
james
allerdyke
until
i
arrived
here
just
now
and
met
fullaway
there
i
never
spoke
of
the
matter
to
any
one
the
official
looked
at
allerdyke
as
if
inviting
him
to
ask
any
question
that
occurred
to
him
and
allerdyke
immediately
brought
up
that
which
had
been
in
his
mind
ever
since
his
discovery
of
james
how
came
you
to
repose
such
confidence
in
my
cousin
he
asked
brusquely
i
always
thought
i
was
pretty
deep
in
his
counsels
but
i
never
heard
him
mention
your
name
did
he
know
you
well
i
had
known
james
allerdyke
for
a
little
over
a
year
replied
the
princess
i
met
him
first
in
paris
then
on
the
riviera
then
in
russia
the
fact
is
he
did
some
business
for
me
i
had
every
confidence
in
him
the
fullest
confidence
i
knew
he
was
a
thoroughly
straight
man
and
just
as
i
had
decided
to
sell
these
jewels
all
my
own
property
mind
in
order
to
clear
off
the
whole
lot
of
the
mortgages
on
my
estate
so
he
could
come
into
them
quite
unencumbered
i
happened
to
meet
james
allerdyke
in
petersburg
that
of
course
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
immediately
took
him
into
my
confidence
and
asked
his
help
with
the
result
added
the
princess
that
he
cabled
to
fullaway
there
and
that
all
this
has
come
about
i
tell
you
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
at
my
command
she
went
on
turning
to
the
official
and
tapping
the
edge
of
his
desk
as
if
to
accentuate
her
words
it
impossible
that
anybody
over
there
in
russia
could
have
known
of
my
arrangements
with
james
allerdyke
utterly
impossible
for
i
never
spoke
of
them
to
any
one
there
and
i
sure
he
would
not
impossible
is
a
big
word
princess
said
the
official
there
may
have
been
ways
of
leakage
did
you
exchange
any
correspondence
on
the
matter
not
a
line
replied
the
princess
there
was
no
need
we
met
three
times
and
arranged
everything
the
only
correspondence
there
was
if
you
could
call
it
correspondence
was
the
exchange
of
cablegrams
between
james
allerdyke
and
fullaway
i
saw
those
cablegrams
of
course
the
jewels
were
mentioned
but
i
do
believe
james
allerdyke
was
the
sort
of
man
to
leave
his
cablegrams
lying
around
for
somebody
else
to
see
i
know
he
had
them
in
his
no
she
went
on
with
added
emphasis
and
conviction
the
thing
did
not
start
over
there
i
sure
it
been
put
up
here
in
london
well
observed
the
official
after
a
pause
there
only
one
thing
more
i
want
to
ask
you
just
now
princess
you
gave
these
immensely
valuable
jewels
to
james
allerdyke
did
he
hand
you
any
receipt
for
them
a
receipt
which
i
got
here
answered
the
princess
tapping
her
and
it
all
in
his
handwriting
and
made
out
in
the
form
of
an
inventory
all
that
was
at
his
suggestion
and
how
asked
the
official
were
the
jewels
packed
when
given
to
him
very
simply
said
the
princess
that
was
his
suggestion
too
they
were
wrapped
up
in
soft
paper
and
chamois
leather
and
put
into
an
old
which
he
placed
in
his
small
that
bag
he
said
would
never
go
out
of
his
sight
until
he
reached
london
where
when
exhibited
the
jewels
to
fullaway
client
he
was
to
lodge
them
in
a
bank
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
was
a
good
notion
the
jewels
themselves
did
take
up
so
much
room
as
you
might
think
and
he
laid
some
very
ordinary
things
over
the
top
of
the
package
a
cake
or
two
of
soap
a
sponge
and
things
like
that
so
that
supposing
the
had
been
opened
its
contents
would
have
seemed
very
ordinary
you
understand
and
yet
said
the
official
softly
the
thieves
evidently
went
straight
for
that
when
the
critical
moment
came
well
he
continued
looking
round
at
his
visitors
i
do
know
that
we
can
do
more
is
there
anything
any
of
you
ladies
or
gentlemen
wish
to
suggest
yes
said
allerdyke
in
my
opinion
a
most
important
thing
it
my
decided
conviction
that
in
this
case
we
got
to
offer
a
reward
no
mere
trifling
sum
but
one
that
set
a
few
fingers
tingling
and
it
my
concern
and
the
princess
and
miss
lennard
and
if
you
permit
us
three
to
have
a
quiet
talk
in
yon
corner
of
your
room
i
tell
you
its
result
when
we
finished
the
result
of
that
quiet
talk
chiefly
conducted
by
allerdyke
with
masculine
force
and
vigour
was
that
by
noon
of
next
day
the
exterior
of
every
london
attracted
vast
attention
by
reason
of
a
bill
it
was
a
long
bill
and
it
set
out
the
surface
particulars
of
three
murders
and
of
two
robberies
in
connection
therewith
the
particulars
made
interesting
reading
enough
but
the
real
fascination
of
the
bill
was
in
its
big
staring
headline
fifty
thousand
pounds
reward
chapter
xv
the
bayswater
some
time
previous
to
these
remarkable
events
marshall
allerdyke
being
constantly
in
london
and
having
to
spend
much
time
on
business
in
the
mansion
house
region
had
sought
and
obtained
membership
of
the
city
carlton
club
in
swithin
lane
and
at
noon
of
the
day
following
the
arrival
of
the
princess
nastirsevitch
he
stood
in
a
window
of
the
looking
out
for
appleyard
whom
he
had
asked
to
lunch
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
folded
copy
of
the
reward
bill
which
blindway
had
left
at
the
waldorf
hotel
for
him
and
while
he
waited
the
room
being
empty
just
then
save
for
an
old
gentleman
who
read
in
a
far
corner
he
unfolded
and
took
a
surreptitious
glance
at
it
chuckling
to
himself
at
the
thought
of
the
cupidity
which
its
contents
and
promises
would
arouse
in
the
breasts
of
the
many
thousands
of
folk
who
would
read
it
fifty
thousand
pounds
he
thought
with
high
amusement
egad
some
of
feel
like
rothschild
himself
if
they
could
shove
that
bit
in
their
pockets
they
take
on
all
the
airs
of
a
croesus
the
thought
of
the
rothschild
wealth
made
him
lift
his
eyes
and
glance
through
the
window
at
the
gate
of
the
quiet
establishment
across
the
way
allerdyke
like
all
men
of
considerable
means
had
a
mighty
respect
for
wealth
in
its
colossal
forms
and
he
never
visited
the
city
carlton
nor
looked
out
of
its
windows
without
glancing
with
interest
and
admiration
at
the
famous
rothschild
offices
immediately
opposite
it
amused
him
to
speculate
and
theorize
about
the
vast
amounts
of
money
which
must
needs
be
turned
over
in
theory
and
practice
within
those
soberly
quiet
walls
to
indulge
in
fancies
about
the
secrets
financial
and
political
which
must
be
discussed
and
locked
up
in
human
breasts
there
to
him
the
magic
address
new
court
swithin
lane
was
as
full
of
potential
mystery
as
the
sphinx
is
to
an
imaginative
traveller
he
glanced
at
its
gates
and
at
its
sign
now
with
an
almost
youthful
awe
and
reverence
the
reverence
of
the
man
of
considerable
wealth
for
the
men
of
enormous
wealth
and
while
his
eyes
were
thus
busy
a
came
along
the
lane
stopped
by
the
entrance
to
new
court
and
set
down
marlow
allerdyke
instinctively
shrank
back
within
the
curtains
of
the
window
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
done
so
he
had
no
objection
to
franklin
fullaway
secretary
seeing
him
standing
in
a
window
of
the
city
carlton
club
he
knew
no
reason
why
marlow
should
object
to
be
seen
getting
out
of
a
cab
in
swithin
lane
yet
he
drew
back
and
from
his
concealed
position
watched
not
that
there
was
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
to
watch
marlow
who
looked
daintier
prettier
more
charming
than
ever
paid
her
driver
gave
him
a
smiling
nod
and
tripped
into
new
court
a
bundle
of
papers
in
her
hand
business
with
rothschild
eh
mused
allerdyke
well
i
daresay
there
a
vast
lot
of
folk
in
this
city
who
do
business
across
there
um
smart
little
woman
that
and
no
doubt
as
clever
as
she
smart
i
like
to
know
just
then
the
ancient
of
the
club
who
surely
missed
his
vocation
in
life
and
should
have
been
a
bishop
or
at
least
a
dean
ushered
in
appleyard
whom
allerdyke
immediately
beckoned
to
join
him
amongst
the
i
say
he
whispered
with
a
side
glance
at
old
gentleman
you
remember
me
telling
you
yesterday
about
the
of
fullaway
mrs
marlow
what
a
smart
bit
she
looked
to
be
eh
well
replied
appleyard
of
course
what
about
her
she
just
gone
into
rothschild
across
there
answered
allerdyke
come
here
this
corner
she
be
coming
out
before
long
no
doubt
and
then
you
see
her
as
i
told
you
about
her
i
want
you
to
take
a
look
at
her
she
worth
seeing
for
more
reasons
than
one
appleyard
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
embrasure
he
waited
patiently
and
in
silence
presently
allerdyke
dug
a
finger
into
his
ribs
she
coming
he
whispered
now
appleyard
looked
across
the
street
the
next
instant
he
was
devoutly
thanking
his
stars
that
since
boyhood
he
had
sedulously
trained
himself
to
control
his
countenance
he
made
no
sign
gave
no
indication
of
previous
acquaintance
as
he
watched
marlow
svelt
figure
trip
out
of
new
court
and
away
up
swithin
lane
his
face
was
as
calm
and
unemotional
his
eyes
as
steady
as
ever
when
he
turned
to
his
employer
pretty
woman
he
said
looks
a
sharp
too
allerdyke
well
he
went
on
turning
away
into
the
room
as
if
marlow
no
longer
interested
him
i
got
those
two
reports
for
you
shall
i
tell
you
about
them
now
aye
for
sure
replied
allerdyke
come
into
this
corner
we
have
a
glass
of
sherry
it
early
for
lunch
yet
those
reports
eh
about
fullaway
and
delkin
you
mean
just
so
said
appleyard
settling
himself
in
the
corner
of
a
lounge
and
lighting
the
cigarette
which
allerdyke
offered
him
they
ordinary
business
reports
you
know
got
through
the
usual
channels
all
right
so
far
as
the
various
commercial
agencies
know
nothing
ever
been
heard
against
him
anyhow
the
account
of
himself
and
his
business
which
he
gave
to
you
is
quite
correct
to
sum
up
he
a
sound
man
quite
straight
on
the
business
surface
which
is
of
course
all
we
can
get
at
as
for
delkin
that
a
straight
story
too
anyway
there
a
chicago
millionaire
of
that
name
been
in
town
some
weeks
he
stopping
at
the
hotel
cecil
has
a
palatial
suite
there
and
his
daughter
about
to
marry
lord
hexwater
all
correct
there
allerdyke
too
i
mean
as
regards
all
that
fullaway
told
you
well
there
something
in
knowing
all
that
ambler
my
lad
answered
allerdyke
you
ca
get
to
know
too
much
about
the
folks
you
dealing
with
you
know
very
good
we
leave
that
now
what
d
think
o
this
he
unfolded
and
held
up
the
reward
bill
first
looking
as
fondly
at
it
as
a
youthful
author
looks
at
his
first
printed
performance
and
then
glancing
at
his
manager
to
see
what
effect
it
had
upon
him
and
he
saw
ambler
appleyard
sandy
eyebrows
go
up
in
a
definite
arch
fifty
thousand
muttered
appleyard
whew
it
a
stiff
figure
allerdyke
you
put
a
thick
finger
in
that
pie
i
thinking
one
half
from
the
princess
twenty
thousand
from
me
five
thousand
from
the
singing
lady
whispered
allerdyke
that
how
it
made
up
my
lad
and
naught
please
me
better
than
to
see
it
paid
out
that
a
fact
you
have
some
triers
said
appleyard
with
an
emphatic
wag
of
the
head
make
no
mistake
about
that
fifty
thousand
gosh
why
anybody
that
got
the
least
clue
the
slightest
idea
and
there
must
be
somebody
have
a
go
in
for
all
he
or
she
worth
let
try
exclaimed
allerdyke
the
welcome
man
the
chap
that
enables
us
to
recover
and
convict
here
shove
that
bill
in
your
pocket
and
read
it
at
your
leisure
there
something
to
think
about
in
what
it
says
i
promise
you
appleyard
went
away
from
the
club
an
hour
and
a
half
later
thinking
hard
enough
but
he
was
not
thinking
about
the
reward
bill
what
he
was
thinking
about
had
been
thinking
about
from
the
moment
in
which
allerdyke
had
drawn
him
into
the
window
and
pointed
her
out
to
him
was
marlow
for
appleyard
knew
marlow
well
enough
but
always
those
buts
in
life
he
reflected
with
a
cynical
laugh
as
he
threaded
his
way
back
to
gresham
street
he
knew
her
by
another
name
miss
slade
and
now
he
was
wondering
why
miss
slade
or
marlow
had
two
names
and
why
she
appeared
to
be
one
person
as
he
knew
her
in
private
life
and
another
as
he
had
seen
her
that
very
morning
on
appleyard
first
coming
to
town
in
the
capacity
of
sole
manager
of
the
london
warehouse
of
allerdyke
and
partners
limited
he
had
set
himself
up
in
two
rooms
in
a
bloomsbury
he
knew
little
of
london
life
at
that
time
or
he
would
have
known
that
he
was
thus
condemning
himself
to
a
drab
and
dreary
existence
as
it
was
he
quickly
learnt
by
experience
and
within
six
months
having
picked
up
a
comfortable
knowledge
of
things
he
transferred
himself
to
one
of
those
boarding
establishments
in
the
best
part
of
bayswater
wherein
bachelors
old
maids
young
women
widowers
and
married
couples
without
encumbrance
can
live
together
in
as
much
or
as
little
friendship
and
intercourse
as
pleases
their
individual
tastes
ambler
appleyard
took
his
time
and
selected
the
likeliest
place
he
could
find
after
much
inspection
of
many
similar
places
his
salary
of
a
thousand
a
year
to
which
was
to
be
added
a
handsome
if
varying
commission
enabled
him
to
pick
and
choose
the
house
which
he
did
choose
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
lancaster
gate
was
of
the
luxurious
order
its
private
rooms
were
models
of
the
last
thing
in
comfort
its
public
rooms
were
equal
to
those
of
the
best
modern
hotels
if
you
wanted
male
society
you
could
find
it
in
the
and
the
if
you
desired
feminine
influences
there
was
a
pleasing
variety
in
the
and
the
lounges
you
could
be
just
as
much
alone
and
just
as
much
in
company
as
you
pleased
anyway
the
place
suited
ambler
appleyard
and
there
he
had
lived
for
two
and
a
half
years
and
during
a
good
two
of
them
the
young
lady
whom
he
knew
as
miss
slade
had
lived
there
too
with
miss
slade
appleyard
as
in
the
same
house
was
on
quite
friendly
terms
he
sometimes
talked
to
her
in
one
of
the
he
knew
her
for
a
clever
rather
brilliant
young
woman
with
ideas
and
the
power
to
express
them
it
was
evident
to
him
that
she
had
travelled
and
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
and
its
men
and
women
she
could
talk
politics
with
far
more
knowledge
and
insight
than
most
women
she
knew
more
than
a
little
of
economic
matters
and
was
inclined
like
appleyard
himself
to
utilitarianism
in
all
things
affecting
government
and
society
but
of
herself
she
never
spoke
directly
all
appleyard
knew
of
her
concerns
was
that
she
was
engaged
in
business
of
some
nature
and
went
to
it
every
morning
as
regularly
and
punctually
as
he
went
to
his
he
judged
that
whatever
her
business
was
she
must
be
well
paid
for
it
or
must
possess
means
of
her
own
nobody
man
or
woman
could
possibly
live
at
that
or
private
hotel
as
its
proprietors
preferred
to
call
it
for
anything
less
than
four
guineas
a
week
well
here
was
the
explanation
of
miss
business
she
was
evidently
private
secretary
to
franklin
fullaway
and
competent
to
do
business
at
a
place
like
rothschild
and
why
not
yet
why
did
she
call
herself
miss
slade
at
the
and
marlow
in
her
business
capacity
and
yet
why
should
she
asked
appleyard
of
himself
a
woman
a
right
to
do
what
she
likes
in
that
way
and
she
is
necessarily
deceitful
because
she
passes
as
a
single
woman
in
one
place
and
a
widow
in
another
i
daresay
she
could
give
a
very
good
reason
for
all
this
but
who
got
any
right
to
ask
her
for
one
not
me
certainly
he
had
no
intention
of
asking
miss
slade
anything
when
he
left
the
city
for
bayswater
that
evening
but
chance
threw
him
into
her
immediate
company
in
one
of
the
lounges
where
after
dinner
they
met
at
a
table
on
which
the
evening
newspapers
were
laid
out
as
miss
slade
picked
up
one
appleyard
picked
up
another
certain
big
strong
letters
on
the
front
sheets
of
both
gave
him
an
opening
have
you
read
anything
about
this
affair
he
asked
with
apparent
carelessness
pointing
to
a
row
of
capitals
this
extraordinary
business
which
is
becoming
the
talk
of
the
town
murders
of
three
people
theft
of
nearly
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewels
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
reward
it
colossal
miss
slade
without
showing
the
slightest
shade
of
interest
shook
her
head
i
do
read
murders
she
answered
fifty
thousand
pounds
reward
that
an
awful
lot
is
it
worth
trying
for
anyway
replied
appleyard
he
gave
her
a
sly
look
and
smiled
grimly
i
think
i
try
for
it
he
said
fifty
thousand
how
could
any
one
try
unless
he
or
she
some
clue
she
asked
if
you
do
know
anything
about
it
or
any
of
the
persons
concerned
where
would
you
begin
there
are
plenty
of
persons
named
in
these
accounts
about
whom
one
could
find
something
out
at
any
rate
replied
appleyard
tapping
the
newspaper
with
his
finger
there
a
russian
princess
with
a
sneezy
sort
of
name
a
yorkshire
manufacturer
named
allerdyke
an
american
man
called
franklin
fullaway
all
seem
to
be
people
in
town
you
ever
hear
of
any
of
them
miss
slade
turned
a
face
of
absolute
indifference
on
him
and
the
paper
to
which
he
was
pointing
never
she
answered
calmly
but
i
daresay
i
shall
hear
of
them
now
for
nine
days
then
she
went
off
with
her
own
newspaper
and
appleyard
carried
his
to
a
corner
and
sat
down
that
a
lie
he
said
to
himself
and
a
woman
who
will
tell
a
lie
as
calmly
and
quietly
as
that
will
tell
a
thousand
with
equal
assurance
and
cleverness
she
there
he
stopped
in
the
doorway
miss
slade
had
also
stopped
stopped
to
speak
to
another
resident
a
man
about
whom
ambler
appleyard
had
often
wondered
as
keenly
as
he
was
now
wondering
about
miss
slade
herself
chapter
xvi
gerald
rayner
there
were
various
reasons
why
ambler
appleyard
wonder
had
often
been
aroused
by
the
man
to
whom
miss
slade
had
stopped
to
speak
he
wondered
about
him
first
of
all
because
of
his
personal
appearance
that
was
striking
enough
to
excite
wonder
in
anybody
for
he
was
one
of
those
remarkable
men
who
possess
great
beauty
of
countenance
allied
to
unfortunate
deformity
of
body
the
face
was
that
of
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
the
body
that
of
a
hunchback
and
a
cripple
painter
or
sculptor
alike
would
have
rejoiced
to
depict
the
face
on
canvas
or
carve
it
in
marble
its
perfect
shape
fine
tinting
the
lines
of
the
features
the
beauty
of
the
eyes
the
wealth
of
the
dark
clustering
hair
were
all
as
near
artistic
perfection
as
could
be
but
all
else
spoke
of
deformity
the
badly
bent
back
the
twisted
body
the
short
leg
the
misshapen
foot
it
was
as
if
nature
had
endeavoured
in
some
wickedly
mischievous
freak
to
show
how
beauty
and
ugliness
can
be
combined
in
one
creature
that
was
one
reason
for
wonder
in
appleyard
mind
he
had
never
come
across
quite
this
type
before
though
he
knew
that
hunchbacks
and
cripples
are
often
gifted
with
unusual
strength
and
more
than
usual
good
looks
as
if
in
ironic
compensation
for
their
other
disadvantages
but
there
were
others
gerald
rayner
everybody
knew
everybody
name
in
that
private
hotel
for
they
were
all
more
or
less
permanent
residents
was
something
of
a
mystery
man
in
spite
of
his
deformity
he
was
the
man
in
the
house
they
were
all
smart
men
there
but
none
of
them
came
up
to
him
in
the
way
of
clothes
linen
and
personal
adornment
always
in
the
best
and
most
cultured
taste
also
it
was
easy
to
gather
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
large
means
although
he
made
full
use
of
the
public
rooms
and
was
always
in
and
about
them
of
an
evening
from
to
a
late
hour
he
tenanted
a
private
suite
of
apartments
in
the
hotel
those
residents
few
in
number
who
had
been
privileged
to
obtain
entrance
to
them
spoke
with
almost
awed
admiration
of
their
occupant
books
pictures
and
objects
of
art
gerald
rayner
it
was
evident
was
a
man
of
culture
that
indeed
was
shown
by
his
conversation
and
at
first
appleyard
had
set
him
down
as
a
poet
or
an
artist
or
a
writing
man
of
some
sort
a
dilettante
who
possessed
private
means
then
being
a
sharp
observer
of
all
that
went
on
around
his
own
centre
he
began
to
perceive
that
he
must
be
mistaken
in
that
rayner
was
obviously
a
business
man
like
himself
for
every
morning
at
precisely
nine
a
smart
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
private
hotel
and
carried
rayner
off
citywards
every
afternoon
at
exactly
five
the
same
conveyance
brought
him
back
only
business
men
said
appleyard
are
so
regular
so
punctual
therefore
rayner
must
be
a
business
man
but
nobody
in
that
hotel
knew
anything
whatever
of
rayner
beyond
what
they
saw
of
him
within
its
walls
nobody
knew
whither
the
carried
him
what
he
did
when
he
reached
his
destination
nobody
knew
what
or
who
he
was
appleyard
who
was
always
knocking
about
the
heart
of
the
city
who
was
for
ever
in
its
business
streets
who
knew
all
the
city
clubs
all
the
best
city
restaurants
and
was
familiar
with
all
sorts
and
shades
of
life
in
the
city
never
saw
rayner
in
any
of
his
own
purlieus
accordingly
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
rayner
business
whatever
it
was
did
not
take
him
to
the
city
nevertheless
it
was
certain
in
appleyard
opinion
that
he
was
in
business
and
paid
scrupulous
attention
to
his
daily
duties
over
the
edge
of
his
newspaper
he
watched
rayner
and
miss
slade
meet
exchange
a
word
or
two
and
retire
to
a
corner
of
an
inner
lounge
in
which
they
often
sat
talking
together
he
had
often
seen
them
talking
together
and
it
had
struck
him
that
they
seemed
to
talk
with
more
than
ordinary
confidence
the
hunchback
was
on
terms
of
easy
familiarity
with
everybody
in
the
house
and
he
had
a
remarkable
range
of
topics
he
could
talk
sport
books
finance
politics
art
science
history
theology
the
variety
of
his
conversation
was
astonishing
but
appleyard
had
begun
to
notice
that
he
rarely
talked
to
any
single
person
with
the
exception
of
miss
slade
he
would
join
a
group
in
or
and
enter
gaily
into
whatever
was
being
discussed
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
desire
to
hold
a
talk
with
any
one
except
this
young
woman
who
was
now
as
much
an
object
of
mystery
and
speculation
to
appleyard
as
he
himself
was
they
were
often
seen
talking
together
in
quiet
corners
and
some
of
the
old
maids
and
eligible
widows
were
already
saying
that
miss
slade
was
setting
her
cap
at
evident
deep
purse
ambler
appleyard
went
to
bed
that
night
wondering
greatly
about
two
matters
first
why
miss
slade
was
miss
slade
in
bayswater
and
marlow
at
fullaway
office
second
if
miss
slade
or
marlow
whichever
she
really
was
had
any
secrets
with
the
mysterious
rayner
from
that
he
got
to
wondering
who
rayner
really
was
and
what
his
business
was
and
this
process
of
speculation
began
again
next
morning
and
continued
all
the
way
to
the
gresham
street
warehouse
and
by
the
time
he
had
arrived
there
he
had
to
find
out
more
about
miss
slade
than
was
known
to
him
up
to
then
and
also
since
he
appeared
to
be
such
great
friends
with
miss
slade
about
gerald
rayner
but
how
he
mused
as
he
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
warehouse
i
not
a
private
detective
and
i
do
propose
to
employ
one
if
i
knew
some
sharp
fellow
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
gaffney
who
sat
on
a
bale
of
goods
within
the
warehouse
door
holding
a
note
in
his
hand
he
stood
up
with
a
grin
of
friendly
recognition
when
he
saw
appleyard
morning
sir
he
said
letter
from
allerdyke
for
you
no
answer
but
i
was
to
wait
till
you
read
it
appleyard
opened
the
note
there
and
then
it
was
a
mere
hurried
scrawl
saying
that
allerdyke
was
just
setting
off
for
hull
in
obedience
to
a
call
from
the
police
as
gaffney
had
nothing
to
do
would
appleyard
make
use
of
him
during
allerdyke
absence
appleyard
bade
gaffney
wait
a
while
went
into
his
office
ran
through
his
correspondence
gave
the
morning
orders
out
to
the
warehouseman
and
called
the
chauffeur
inside
gaffney
he
said
as
he
carefully
closed
the
door
on
them
you
a
londoner
are
you
gaffney
smiled
widely
ought
to
be
appleyard
he
answered
i
was
born
within
sound
of
bow
bells
anyhow
off
aldersgate
street
sir
yes
i
a
cockney
right
enough
then
you
know
london
well
of
course
suggested
appleyard
never
went
out
of
it
much
sir
till
i
went
down
to
bradford
to
this
present
job
replied
gaffney
i
should
have
left
it
if
allerdyke
had
given
me
extra
good
wages
and
a
real
good
place
appleyard
tossed
allerdyke
note
across
his
desk
you
see
what
allerdyke
says
he
remarked
wants
me
to
find
you
something
to
do
while
he
off
how
long
is
he
likely
to
be
off
he
said
he
might
be
back
night
sir
answered
gaffney
glancing
at
the
note
but
possibly
not
till
the
day
after
well
i
do
know
that
there
anything
you
can
do
here
said
appleyard
we
not
particularly
busy
and
we
a
full
staff
but
he
continued
with
a
sharp
glance
at
the
chauffeur
there
something
you
can
do
for
me
privately
morning
a
quite
private
matter
a
matter
entirely
between
ourselves
i
account
to
allerdyke
for
your
time
but
i
do
want
even
him
to
know
about
this
job
that
you
can
do
for
me
i
pay
you
for
doing
it
out
of
my
own
pocket
just
as
you
think
right
sir
answered
gaffney
so
long
as
you
make
it
right
with
the
i
willing
very
well
said
appleyard
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
lowered
his
voice
you
seen
about
this
tremendous
reward
that
being
offered
in
james
allerdyke
case
he
asked
with
another
sharp
look
you
know
what
i
mean
gaffney
shrewd
face
grew
shrewder
and
he
nodded
knowingly
i
know
he
said
fifty
thousand
a
fortune
sir
what
i
want
you
to
do
continued
appleyard
may
lead
to
something
relating
to
that
and
it
may
anyway
i
make
you
all
right
now
listen
carefully
do
you
think
you
could
get
hold
of
a
private
motor
morning
a
smart
private
cab
in
which
you
could
put
a
friend
of
yours
well
dressed
would
be
the
thing
early
easy
as
winking
sir
answered
gaffney
know
the
cab
and
know
a
friend
who
sit
in
it
as
long
as
you
like
very
good
said
appleyard
now
then
do
you
know
lancaster
gate
do
i
know
st
paul
exclaimed
gaffney
used
to
drive
for
an
old
gent
who
lived
in
porchester
terrace
oh
replied
appleyard
then
i
daresay
you
know
the
pompadour
private
hotel
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
fingers
responded
gaffney
driven
to
and
from
it
many
a
hundred
times
just
the
man
i
want
then
continued
appleyard
now
morning
get
your
cab
early
put
your
friend
in
it
dressed
up
of
course
and
at
nine
to
the
very
minute
drive
slowly
past
the
front
door
of
the
pompadour
you
see
a
private
there
dark
green
you
also
see
a
hunchbacked
gentleman
enter
it
you
ca
mistake
him
follow
him
never
mind
where
he
goes
or
how
long
it
takes
to
get
there
or
how
few
minutes
it
takes
to
get
there
for
that
matter
follow
him
and
find
out
where
that
private
cab
puts
him
down
then
come
and
report
to
me
is
that
all
clear
clear
as
noonday
sir
answered
gaffney
i
understand
i
been
at
that
sort
of
game
more
than
once
all
right
said
appleyard
i
leave
it
to
you
take
every
care
i
do
want
this
man
to
get
the
least
suspicion
that
he
followed
and
he
hesitated
considering
his
plans
over
again
yes
he
went
on
there
just
another
detail
that
i
may
mention
it
save
time
this
hunchback
gentleman
name
is
rayner
gerald
rayner
can
you
remember
it
as
well
as
my
own
answered
gaffney
gerald
rayner
i
got
it
very
good
now
then
can
you
trust
this
friend
of
yours
asked
appleyard
is
he
a
chap
of
common
sense
it
my
own
brother
replied
gaffney
some
people
say
i
the
sharper
of
the
two
some
say
he
is
there
a
pair
of
us
anyhow
that
do
said
appleyard
now
wherever
you
see
this
rayner
set
down
let
your
brother
get
out
of
your
cab
and
take
particular
notice
if
he
goes
into
any
shop
office
flats
buildings
anything
of
that
sort
which
bears
his
name
rayner
see
i
want
to
know
what
his
business
is
and
now
that
you
know
what
i
want
you
and
your
brother
put
your
heads
together
and
try
to
find
it
out
and
come
to
me
when
you
done
and
i
make
it
worth
your
while
you
better
go
now
and
make
your
arrangements
gaffney
went
away
evidently
delighted
with
his
commission
and
appleyard
turned
to
his
business
of
the
day
wondering
if
he
was
not
going
to
waste
the
chauffer
time
and
his
own
money
next
morning
he
purposely
hung
about
the
pompadour
until
the
time
for
rayner
departure
arrived
from
one
of
the
front
windows
he
saw
the
hunchback
enter
his
brougham
and
drive
away
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
a
neat
private
cab
driven
by
gaffney
and
occupied
by
a
young
gentleman
in
a
silk
hat
come
along
and
follow
in
quite
an
ordinary
and
usual
manner
and
on
that
he
himself
went
to
gresham
street
and
waited
gaffney
and
his
brother
turned
in
during
the
morning
both
evidently
primed
with
news
appleyard
shut
himself
into
his
office
with
them
well
he
asked
easy
job
appleyard
replied
gaffney
drove
straight
through
the
park
constitution
hill
the
mall
strand
to
top
of
arundel
street
there
he
got
out
brougham
went
off
back
he
walked
down
street
so
my
brother
here
he
got
out
too
and
strolled
down
street
after
him
tell
you
the
rest
sir
just
as
plain
as
what
he
told
said
the
other
gaffney
i
followed
him
down
the
street
he
walked
one
side
i
side
he
went
into
clytemnestra
house
one
of
those
big
houses
of
business
flats
and
offices
almost
at
the
bottom
i
waited
some
time
to
see
if
he
was
settled
like
or
if
it
was
only
a
call
he
was
making
then
i
went
into
the
hall
of
clytemnestra
house
as
if
i
was
looking
for
somebody
there
are
two
boards
in
that
hall
with
the
names
of
tenants
painted
on
but
there
not
that
name
gerald
rayner
still
i
tell
you
what
there
is
sir
there
a
name
that
begins
with
the
same
initials
what
name
asked
appleyard
the
name
replied
the
second
gaffney
is
gavin
ramsay
agent
chapter
xvii
the
photograph
allerdyke
went
off
to
hull
because
of
a
telephone
call
which
roused
him
out
of
bed
an
hour
before
his
usual
time
it
came
from
chettle
the
new
scotland
yard
man
who
had
been
sent
down
to
hull
as
soon
as
the
news
of
lydenberg
murder
arrived
chettle
asked
allerdyke
to
join
him
by
the
very
next
express
and
to
come
alone
he
asked
him
moreover
not
to
tell
franklin
fullaway
whither
he
was
bound
and
allerdyke
having
taken
a
quick
glance
at
a
summoned
gaffney
told
him
of
his
journey
bade
him
keep
his
tongue
quiet
at
the
waldorf
wrote
his
hasty
note
to
appleyard
dressed
and
hurried
away
to
cross
he
breakfasted
on
the
train
and
was
in
hull
by
one
and
chettle
hailed
him
as
he
set
foot
on
the
platform
and
immediately
led
him
off
to
a
cab
which
awaited
them
outside
the
station
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
so
promptly
allerdyke
said
the
detective
and
for
coming
by
yourself
that
was
just
what
i
wanted
aye
and
why
asked
allerdyke
why
by
myself
i
been
wondering
about
that
all
the
way
down
chettle
a
sleek
man
with
a
quiet
manner
and
a
sly
glance
laughed
knowingly
twiddling
his
fat
thumbs
as
he
leaned
back
in
the
cab
oh
well
it
does
do
in
my
opinion
to
spread
information
amongst
too
many
people
allerdyke
he
said
that
my
notion
of
things
anyway
i
just
wanted
to
go
into
a
few
matters
with
you
alone
d
see
i
did
want
that
american
gentleman
along
with
you
eh
now
why
asked
allerdyke
out
with
it
well
you
see
allerdyke
answered
the
detective
we
know
you
you
a
man
of
substance
you
got
a
big
stake
in
the
country
allerdyke
of
allerdyke
and
partners
limited
bradford
and
london
but
we
do
know
fullaway
he
may
be
all
right
but
you
could
only
call
him
a
bird
of
passage
like
he
can
close
down
his
business
and
be
away
out
of
england
and
personally
i
do
believe
in
letting
him
into
every
secret
about
all
this
affair
until
we
know
more
about
him
you
see
allerdyke
there
one
thing
very
certain
so
far
as
ascertained
at
present
nobody
but
fullaway
and
possibly
whoever
in
his
employ
was
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
your
cousin
was
carrying
those
jewels
from
russia
to
england
nobody
in
this
country
at
any
rate
and
it
a
thing
of
serious
importance
sir
just
what
appleyard
had
said
what
indeed
no
one
of
discernment
could
help
saying
thought
allerdyke
the
sole
knowledge
of
course
was
with
fullaway
and
his
lady
clerk
so
far
as
was
known
therefore
just
so
he
said
aloud
i
see
your
point
of
course
i
already
seen
it
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
you
brought
me
down
here
for
something
special
no
doubt
quite
so
sir
answered
chettle
composedly
i
want
to
draw
your
attention
to
some
very
special
features
and
to
ask
you
certain
questions
arising
out
of
we
take
things
in
order
allerdyke
driving
now
to
the
high
street
i
want
to
show
you
the
exact
spot
where
lydenberg
was
shot
dead
after
that
we
go
to
the
and
i
show
you
two
or
three
little
matters
and
we
have
a
talk
about
them
and
now
before
we
get
to
the
high
street
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
on
examining
lydenberg
body
very
little
was
found
in
the
way
of
papers
scarcely
anything
and
nothing
connecting
him
with
your
affair
in
fact
the
police
here
say
they
never
saw
a
foreign
gentleman
with
less
on
him
in
that
way
but
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
overcoat
there
was
a
postcard
which
had
been
posted
here
in
hull
here
it
is
and
you
see
that
it
was
the
cause
of
taking
him
to
the
spot
where
he
was
shot
chettle
took
from
an
old
an
postcard
on
one
corner
of
which
was
a
stain
his
blood
he
remarked
laconically
he
was
shot
clean
through
the
heart
well
you
see
it
a
mere
line
allerdyke
took
the
card
and
looked
at
it
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
repulsion
and
fascination
the
writing
on
it
was
thin
angular
upright
and
it
suggested
foreign
origin
and
the
communication
was
brief
and
unsigned
high
street
morning
eleven
sharp
side
old
houses
you
do
recognize
that
handwriting
of
course
mr
allerdyke
asked
chettle
never
seen
it
before
i
suppose
no
replied
allerdyke
never
but
i
should
say
it
a
foreigner
very
likely
assented
chettle
aye
well
sir
it
lured
the
man
to
his
death
and
now
i
show
you
where
he
died
and
how
easy
it
was
for
the
murderer
to
kill
him
and
get
away
unobserved
he
pulled
the
cab
up
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
and
turned
southward
towards
the
river
looking
round
at
his
companion
with
one
of
his
sly
smiles
i
daresay
that
you
being
a
yorkshireman
allerdyke
know
all
about
this
old
street
he
remarked
as
they
walked
forward
i
never
saw
it
never
heard
of
it
until
the
other
day
when
i
was
sent
down
on
this
lydenberg
business
but
it
struck
me
at
once
i
should
think
it
one
of
the
oldest
streets
left
in
england
it
is
answered
allerdyke
i
know
it
well
enough
and
i
seen
it
changed
it
used
to
be
the
street
of
the
old
hull
merchants
they
had
their
houses
and
warehouses
all
combined
with
gardens
at
the
back
running
down
to
the
river
hull
queer
old
places
there
used
to
be
in
this
street
i
can
tell
you
when
i
was
a
lad
of
late
years
they
pulled
a
lot
of
property
down
that
had
got
what
you
might
call
thoroughly
oh
yes
the
place
is
half
as
ancient
or
picturesque
as
it
was
even
twenty
years
ago
there
plenty
of
the
ancient
about
it
still
for
all
that
observed
chettle
with
a
dry
laugh
there
was
more
than
enough
of
it
for
lydenberg
the
other
day
at
any
rate
now
then
you
remember
what
it
said
on
the
postcard
he
was
to
walk
down
the
high
street
on
the
side
at
eleven
very
well
down
the
high
street
he
walks
on
this
side
which
we
are
now
he
strolls
along
by
these
old
houses
looking
about
him
of
course
for
the
person
he
was
to
meet
the
few
people
who
were
about
down
here
that
morning
and
who
saw
him
said
that
he
was
looking
about
from
side
to
side
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
shot
rang
out
and
lydenberg
fell
just
here
right
on
this
very
pavement
he
pulled
allerdyke
up
in
a
narrow
part
of
the
old
street
jointed
to
the
flags
and
then
to
the
house
behind
them
an
ancient
ramshackle
place
the
doors
and
windows
of
which
were
boarded
up
the
entire
fabric
of
which
showed
unmistakable
readiness
for
the
pick
and
shovel
of
the
and
he
laid
a
hand
on
one
of
the
shattered
windows
close
by
a
big
hole
in
the
decaying
wood
there
no
doubt
the
murderer
was
hidden
behind
this
shutter
and
that
he
fired
at
lydenberg
from
it
through
this
hole
he
said
so
you
see
he
only
be
a
few
feet
from
his
man
he
was
evidently
a
good
shot
and
a
fellow
of
resolute
nerve
for
he
made
no
mistake
he
only
fired
once
but
he
shot
lydenberg
clean
through
the
heart
dead
anybody
see
it
happen
asked
allerdyke
staring
about
him
at
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
and
thinking
how
very
ordinary
and
commonplace
everything
looked
i
suppose
there
be
people
about
though
the
street
at
this
end
anyway
is
as
busy
as
it
once
was
several
people
saw
him
fall
answered
chettle
they
say
he
jumped
spun
round
and
fell
across
the
pavement
and
they
all
thought
it
was
a
case
of
suicide
that
of
course
gave
the
murderer
a
bigger
and
better
chance
of
making
off
you
see
as
these
people
saw
no
assailant
it
never
struck
that
the
shot
had
been
fired
from
behind
this
window
when
they
collected
their
thoughts
found
it
was
suicide
and
realized
that
it
was
murder
the
murderer
was
lord
knows
where
from
behind
these
old
houses
allerdyke
there
a
perfect
of
alleys
courts
slums
twists
and
turns
the
man
could
slip
out
at
the
back
go
left
or
right
mix
himself
up
with
the
crowd
on
the
quays
and
wharves
walk
into
the
streets
go
anywhere
all
in
a
minute
or
two
clever
very
clever
you
no
clue
asked
allerdyke
none
not
a
scrap
replied
the
detective
bless
you
there
score
of
foreigners
knocking
about
hull
scores
hundreds
we
done
all
we
can
the
local
police
and
myself
we
no
clue
whatever
but
of
course
it
was
done
by
one
of
the
gang
by
one
of
the
gang
exclaimed
allerdyke
ah
you
got
a
theory
of
your
own
then
chettle
laughed
quietly
as
they
turned
and
retraced
their
steps
up
the
street
it
be
queer
if
i
had
by
this
time
he
answered
oh
yes
thought
things
out
pretty
well
and
i
should
say
our
people
at
the
yard
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
i
have
i
not
conceited
enough
allerdyke
to
fancy
that
i
the
only
person
who
arrived
at
a
reasonable
theory
not
i
well
what
is
your
theory
asked
allerdyke
this
replied
the
detective
the
whole
thing
the
theft
of
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
from
your
cousin
of
miss
de
or
lennard
jewels
was
the
work
of
a
peculiarly
clever
gang
though
it
may
be
of
an
individual
who
made
use
of
both
lydenberg
and
the
french
maid
as
instruments
and
subsequently
murdered
those
two
in
order
to
silence
them
forever
i
say
it
may
be
the
work
of
an
individual
quite
possible
that
the
man
who
killed
the
frenchwoman
is
also
the
man
who
shot
lydenberg
but
it
may
be
the
work
of
one
two
or
three
separate
persons
acting
in
collusion
i
believe
that
lydenberg
was
the
actual
thief
of
the
princess
jewels
from
your
cousin
that
the
frenchwoman
actually
stole
her
mistress
jewels
but
as
to
how
it
was
worked
as
to
who
invented
and
carried
out
the
whole
thing
ah
and
to
that
to
the
real
secret
of
the
whole
matter
we
have
the
ghost
of
a
clue
muttered
allerdyke
that
about
it
eh
chettle
laughed
a
sly
suggestive
laugh
he
gave
his
companion
one
of
his
looks
i
not
so
sure
allerdyke
he
said
we
may
have
and
that
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
by
yourself
come
round
to
the
in
a
quiet
room
in
the
usual
drab
and
dismal
atmosphere
which
allerdyke
was
beginning
to
associate
with
police
affairs
chettle
produced
the
personal
property
of
the
dead
man
all
removed
he
said
from
the
station
hotel
for
safe
keeping
there
little
to
go
on
allerdyke
he
said
pointing
to
one
article
after
another
you
remember
that
the
man
represented
himself
as
being
a
norwegian
doctor
who
had
come
to
hull
on
private
business
he
may
have
been
that
we
making
inquiries
about
him
in
christiania
where
he
hailed
from
according
to
those
who
in
a
position
to
speak
his
clothing
linen
boots
and
so
on
are
all
of
the
sort
you
get
in
that
country
but
he
no
papers
on
him
to
show
his
business
no
private
letters
no
documents
connecting
him
with
hull
in
any
way
he
had
even
a
he
a
return
ticket
from
hull
to
christiania
and
plenty
of
money
english
and
foreign
when
i
got
down
here
i
helped
the
local
police
to
go
through
everything
we
even
searched
the
linings
of
his
clothing
and
ripped
his
one
handbag
to
pieces
but
we
found
no
more
than
i
said
however
i
found
something
nobody
knows
that
i
found
it
i
have
told
the
people
here
i
have
even
reported
it
to
headquarters
in
london
i
wanted
you
to
see
it
before
i
spoke
of
it
to
a
soul
look
here
chettle
opened
a
square
cardboard
box
in
which
certain
personal
effects
belonging
to
lydenberg
had
been
placed
one
or
two
rings
a
his
purse
and
its
contents
a
his
watch
and
chain
he
took
up
the
watch
detached
it
from
the
chain
and
held
it
towards
allerdyke
who
was
regarding
these
proceedings
with
intense
curiosity
you
see
this
watch
allerdyke
he
said
it
a
watch
of
foreign
make
swiss
and
it
an
old
one
a
good
many
years
old
i
should
say
consequently
it
a
bit
what
we
might
call
massive
now
i
was
looking
at
it
yesterday
late
last
night
in
fact
and
an
idea
suddenly
struck
me
in
consequence
of
that
idea
i
opened
the
back
of
the
watch
and
discovered
that
he
snapped
open
the
case
of
the
watch
as
he
spoke
and
showed
allerdyke
neatly
cut
out
to
a
circle
neatly
fitted
into
the
case
a
photograph
the
photograph
of
james
allerdyke
and
allerdyke
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
let
out
a
sharp
exclamation
my
god
he
cried
james
james
by
all
that
holy
and
in
there
you
recognize
it
of
course
said
chettle
with
a
grim
smile
no
doubt
of
it
eh
doubt
recognize
exclaimed
allerdyke
lord
man
why
i
took
it
myself
not
two
months
ago
chapter
xviii
definite
suspicion
chettle
laughed
a
low
suggestive
satisfied
chuckle
he
laid
the
watch
its
case
still
open
on
the
table
at
which
they
were
standing
and
tapped
the
photograph
with
the
point
of
his
finger
that
may
be
the
first
step
to
the
scaffold
for
somebody
he
said
with
a
meaning
glance
ah
it
extraordinary
what
little
things
help
to
put
a
bit
of
rope
round
a
man
neck
so
you
took
this
mr
allerdyke
took
it
yourself
you
say
took
it
myself
some
eight
or
nine
weeks
ago
answered
allerdyke
i
took
it
in
my
garden
one
sunday
afternoon
when
my
cousin
james
happened
to
be
there
i
do
a
bit
in
that
way
amusement
you
know
i
just
chanced
to
have
a
camera
in
my
hand
and
i
saw
james
in
a
very
favourable
light
and
position
and
i
snapped
him
and
it
was
such
a
good
when
developed
that
i
printed
off
a
few
copies
the
detective
face
became
anxious
how
many
now
he
asked
how
many
allerdyke
i
hope
you
can
remember
it
a
point
of
the
utmost
seriousness
naught
easier
answered
allerdyke
readily
i
a
good
memory
for
little
things
as
well
as
big
i
printed
off
four
copies
one
of
i
pasted
into
an
album
in
which
i
keep
particularly
good
photographs
of
my
own
taking
the
other
three
i
gave
to
him
he
put
in
his
all
unmounted
like
this
asked
chettle
all
unmounted
like
that
affirmed
allerdyke
and
now
then
since
it
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
importance
i
can
tell
you
what
james
did
with
at
any
rate
two
of
he
gave
one
to
our
cousin
grace
henry
mallins
a
bradford
lady
he
gave
another
to
a
friend
of
my
own
another
amateur
photographer
wilson
firth
gave
him
it
in
my
presence
at
the
midland
hotel
one
day
when
we
were
all
three
having
a
cigar
together
in
the
there
wilson
firth
a
bit
of
a
rival
of
mine
in
the
amateur
photographic
line
we
each
try
to
beat
the
other
you
understand
now
then
james
pulled
one
of
these
snapshots
out
and
handed
it
over
to
wilson
with
a
laugh
he
says
our
marshall
latest
performance
you
have
a
job
to
do
aught
better
than
that
wilson
my
lad
he
says
so
that
accounts
for
two
and
this
is
the
third
and
the
question
allerdyke
the
big
question
a
most
important
question
is
how
did
it
come
into
this
man
lydenberg
possession
said
the
detective
anxiously
if
we
can
find
that
out
i
been
thinking
interrupted
allerdyke
there
this
about
it
you
know
james
and
this
lydenberg
came
over
together
from
christiania
to
hull
in
the
they
talked
to
one
another
that
certain
james
may
have
given
it
to
lydenberg
but
the
thing
is
is
that
likely
no
replied
chettle
with
emphatic
assurance
no
sir
and
i
tell
you
why
if
your
cousin
had
given
this
photo
to
lydenberg
as
he
might
of
course
have
given
it
to
a
mere
passing
acquaintance
because
that
acquaintance
took
a
fancy
to
it
or
something
of
that
sort
lydenberg
would
in
all
reasonable
probability
have
just
slipped
in
into
his
or
put
it
loose
amongst
his
letters
and
papers
but
as
we
see
however
lydenberg
became
possessed
of
this
photo
he
took
unusual
pains
and
precautions
about
it
you
see
he
cut
it
down
most
carefully
and
neatly
to
fit
into
the
cover
of
his
watch
he
took
the
trouble
to
carry
it
where
no
one
else
would
see
it
but
where
he
could
see
it
himself
at
a
second
notice
he
nothing
to
do
but
to
snap
open
that
cover
no
sir
your
cousin
did
give
that
photo
to
lydenberg
that
photo
was
sent
to
lydenberg
allerdyke
sent
and
it
was
sent
for
one
purpose
only
what
that
he
should
be
able
to
identify
james
allerdyke
as
soon
as
he
set
eyes
on
him
allerdyke
nodded
his
head
in
complete
understanding
and
affirmation
he
was
thinking
the
same
thing
thinking
too
that
here
was
at
least
a
clue
a
real
tangible
clue
aye
he
said
i
agree
with
you
then
of
course
the
one
and
only
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
who
the
person
was
that
your
cousin
gave
this
particular
print
to
said
chettle
eagerly
of
course
it
a
big
field
so
far
as
i
understand
things
he
been
knocking
round
a
good
bit
between
the
time
of
your
taking
this
photo
and
his
death
he
been
in
london
had
he
and
in
russia
in
two
or
three
places
how
can
we
find
out
when
and
how
he
parted
with
this
for
give
it
to
somebody
he
did
and
that
somebody
was
a
person
who
knew
of
the
jewel
transaction
and
employed
lydenberg
in
it
and
sent
the
photo
to
lydenberg
so
that
he
should
know
your
cousin
by
sight
at
once
allerdyke
the
secret
of
these
murders
and
thefts
is
there
chettle
replaced
the
watch
in
the
cardboard
box
from
which
he
had
taken
it
produced
a
bit
of
from
his
pocket
sealed
up
the
box
and
put
it
and
the
other
things
belonging
to
lydenberg
back
in
the
small
trunk
from
which
he
had
withdrawn
them
to
show
his
companion
and
allerdyke
watched
him
in
silence
wondering
and
speculating
about
this
new
development
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
suddenly
you
got
some
scheme
of
course
or
you
would
have
got
me
down
here
alone
just
so
agreed
chettle
i
have
a
scheme
and
that
why
i
did
get
you
down
here
alone
allerdyke
you
a
sharp
shrewd
man
all
you
yorkshiremen
are
at
least
all
that
i
ever
come
across
you
good
hands
at
ferreting
things
out
now
allerdyke
let
be
plain
there
no
two
ways
about
it
no
doubt
whatever
of
it
the
only
people
in
england
that
we
aware
of
who
knew
about
this
nastirsevitch
jewel
transaction
are
fullaway
and
whoever
he
has
in
his
employ
we
know
of
nobody
else
unless
indeed
it
the
chicago
millionaire
delkin
and
he
not
very
likely
to
have
wanted
to
go
in
for
a
job
of
this
sort
no
sir
fullaway
is
the
suspected
person
in
my
opinion
though
i
going
to
take
precious
good
care
to
keep
that
opinion
to
myself
yet
awhile
i
can
tell
you
fullaway
allerdyke
fullaway
well
demanded
allerdyke
and
so
and
so
i
want
you
to
use
your
utmost
ingenuity
to
find
out
if
your
cousin
james
gave
that
photo
to
fullaway
continued
chettle
we
know
very
well
that
he
was
in
touch
with
fullaway
before
he
went
off
to
russia
i
have
it
in
my
notes
that
when
fullaway
came
to
see
you
here
in
hull
at
the
station
hotel
the
day
of
your
cousin
death
he
told
you
that
he
and
james
allerdyke
had
been
doing
business
for
a
couple
of
years
and
that
they
last
met
in
london
about
the
end
of
march
just
before
your
cousin
set
off
on
his
journey
to
russia
is
that
correct
quite
correct
to
the
letter
answered
allerdyke
very
well
said
chettle
now
according
to
you
that
be
not
so
very
long
after
you
took
that
snapshot
of
your
cousin
so
he
probably
have
the
third
print
of
it
the
one
we
just
been
looking
at
on
him
when
he
was
in
london
at
that
time
very
likely
assented
allerdyke
then
said
chettle
with
great
eagerness
try
allerdyke
try
your
best
and
cleverest
to
find
out
if
he
gave
it
to
fullaway
you
can
think
you
with
a
sharp
brain
of
some
cunning
fashion
of
finding
that
out
what
i
do
know
replied
allerdyke
slowly
and
doubtfully
he
possessed
quite
as
much
ingenuity
as
chettle
credited
him
with
but
his
own
resourcefulness
in
that
direction
only
inclined
him
to
credit
other
men
with
the
possession
of
just
the
same
faculty
i
do
know
about
that
if
james
did
give
that
print
to
fullaway
and
if
fullaway
made
use
of
it
as
you
think
fullaway
be
far
too
cute
ever
to
let
on
that
it
was
given
to
him
see
i
see
that
been
seeing
it
all
through
answered
chettle
all
the
same
there
ways
and
means
think
of
something
you
know
fullaway
a
bit
by
this
time
try
it
oh
i
try
it
you
bet
exclaimed
allerdyke
i
try
it
for
all
it
worth
and
as
cleverly
as
i
can
in
fact
i
already
thought
of
a
plan
and
if
you
do
want
me
any
more
just
now
i
go
to
the
and
send
off
a
telegram
that
something
to
do
with
it
nothing
more
now
sir
answered
chettle
but
look
here
you
not
going
back
to
town
why
that
just
what
i
meant
to
do
replied
allerdyke
there
naught
to
stop
here
for
is
there
i
expecting
a
message
from
the
christiania
police
some
time
this
afternoon
or
evening
said
chettle
i
cabled
to
them
yesterday
making
full
inquiries
about
lydenberg
he
represented
himself
here
to
orwin
and
the
especially
as
being
a
medical
man
in
practice
in
christiania
who
had
come
across
to
hull
on
some
entirely
private
family
business
now
we
made
the
most
exhaustive
inquiries
here
in
hull
there
is
a
soul
in
the
town
knows
anything
whatever
of
lydenberg
i
as
certain
as
i
am
that
i
see
you
that
he
no
business
here
at
all
except
to
kill
and
rob
your
cousin
and
so
of
course
we
want
to
know
if
he
really
was
what
he
said
he
was
over
there
i
pressed
upon
the
christiania
police
to
let
me
know
all
they
could
within
hours
so
if
you
stop
the
night
here
i
likely
be
able
to
show
you
their
reply
to
me
right
answered
allerdyke
i
put
up
at
the
station
hotel
you
come
and
have
your
dinner
with
me
there
at
seven
much
obliged
allerdyke
replied
chettle
i
come
then
allerdyke
went
off
to
the
general
post
office
and
sent
a
telegram
to
his
housekeeper
in
bradford
send
off
at
once
by
registered
parcel
post
to
me
at
waldorf
hotel
london
the
photograph
album
lying
on
corner
of
my
in
the
marshall
allerdyke
he
went
out
of
the
laughing
cynically
bit
by
bit
things
were
coming
out
he
said
to
himself
as
he
strolled
away
towards
the
hotel
link
after
link
the
chain
was
being
forged
but
around
whom
in
the
end
was
it
going
to
be
fastened
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
been
brought
face
to
face
with
crime
and
the
seeking
out
of
the
criminal
was
beginning
to
fascinate
him
egad
it
a
queer
business
he
muttered
a
thread
here
a
thread
there
heaven
knows
what
it
all
come
to
but
this
chettle
a
good
he
like
to
do
things
chettle
joined
him
in
the
of
the
hotel
at
a
quarter
to
seven
and
immediately
produced
a
telegram
came
half
an
hour
ago
he
said
as
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
nobody
but
myself
seen
it
up
to
now
and
it
just
what
i
expected
read
it
allerdyke
slowly
read
the
message
through
pondering
over
it
we
have
made
fullest
inquiries
concerning
lydenberg
he
was
certainly
not
in
practice
here
either
under
that
or
any
other
name
nothing
is
known
of
him
as
a
resident
in
this
city
we
have
definitely
ascertained
that
he
came
to
christiania
from
copenhagen
by
land
via
lund
and
copenhagen
arriving
christiania
may
and
that
he
left
here
by
steamship
for
hull
may
you
notice
the
dates
observed
chettle
may
and
now
it
was
on
may
that
your
cousin
wired
to
fullaway
from
christiania
allerdyke
there
no
doubt
about
it
this
man
lydenberg
whoever
he
is
or
was
was
sent
to
waylay
your
cousin
at
christiania
sent
from
london
i
worked
it
out
he
went
overland
belgium
holland
germany
denmark
sweden
norway
sounds
a
lot
but
it
a
quick
journey
sir
he
was
sent
and
the
sooner
we
find
out
about
that
photograph
the
better
i
at
work
answered
allerdyke
leave
it
to
me
he
found
his
photograph
album
awaiting
him
when
he
arrived
at
the
waldorf
hotel
next
day
and
during
the
afternoon
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
strolled
quietly
and
casually
into
franklin
fullaway
rooms
everything
there
looked
as
he
had
always
seen
it
marlow
charming
as
ever
was
tapping
steadily
at
her
typewriter
fullaway
himself
a
large
cigar
in
his
mouth
was
reading
the
american
newspapers
just
arrived
in
his
own
sanctum
he
greeted
allerdyke
with
enthusiasm
been
away
since
yesterday
eh
he
said
after
warm
greetings
home
aye
i
been
down
to
yorkshire
responded
allerdyke
offhandedly
one
or
two
things
i
wanted
to
see
to
and
some
things
i
wanted
to
get
this
is
one
of
family
bible
inquired
fullaway
eyeing
the
solemnly
bound
album
no
photos
answered
allerdyke
he
was
going
to
test
things
at
once
and
he
opened
the
book
at
the
fateful
page
i
a
bit
of
an
amateur
photographer
he
went
on
with
a
laugh
here
what
probably
the
last
photo
ever
taken
of
james
what
d
think
of
it
fullaway
glanced
at
the
photograph
all
unconscious
that
his
caller
was
watching
him
as
he
had
never
been
watched
in
his
life
he
waved
his
cigar
at
the
open
page
oh
he
said
airily
a
remarkably
good
likeness
wonderful
i
said
so
when
i
saw
it
before
excellent
likeness
allerdyke
excellent
be
beaten
by
a
professional
excellent
marshall
allerdyke
felt
his
heart
beating
like
a
sledgehammer
as
he
put
his
next
question
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
tell
how
he
managed
to
keep
his
voice
under
control
ah
he
said
you
seen
it
before
then
james
show
it
to
you
fullaway
nodded
towards
the
door
of
the
outer
room
from
which
came
the
faint
click
of
the
secretary
machine
he
gave
one
to
marlow
the
very
last
time
he
was
here
he
answered
they
were
talking
about
amateur
photography
and
he
pulled
a
print
of
that
out
of
his
pocket
and
made
her
a
present
of
it
said
it
could
be
beaten
you
a
clever
hand
allerdyke
most
lifelike
portrait
i
ever
saw
well
any
news
chapter
xix
the
late
call
it
was
with
a
mighty
effort
of
will
that
allerdyke
controlled
himself
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
answer
fullaway
question
with
calmness
this
was
for
him
a
critical
moment
he
knew
now
to
whom
james
allerdyke
had
given
the
photograph
which
chettle
had
found
concealed
in
watch
knew
that
the
recipient
was
sitting
close
by
him
separated
only
from
him
by
a
wall
and
a
door
knew
that
between
her
and
lydenberg
or
those
who
had
been
in
touch
with
lydenberg
there
must
be
some
strange
secret
and
sinister
connection
from
marlow
to
lydenberg
that
photograph
had
somehow
passed
and
as
chettle
had
well
said
the
entire
problem
of
the
murders
and
thefts
was
mixed
up
in
its
transference
all
that
was
certain
what
seemed
certain
too
was
that
fullaway
knew
nothing
of
these
things
and
was
as
innocent
as
he
himself
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
was
to
tell
all
he
knew
to
fullaway
there
and
then
and
it
was
only
by
a
still
stronger
effort
of
will
that
he
restrained
his
tongue
determined
to
keep
a
stricter
silence
than
ever
and
replied
to
the
american
in
an
offhand
casual
tone
news
he
said
with
a
nay
not
that
i
know
of
they
take
their
time
those
detective
chaps
you
heard
aught
nothing
particular
answered
fullaway
except
that
the
princess
was
in
here
this
morning
and
that
miss
lennard
came
at
the
same
time
but
neither
of
them
had
anything
of
importance
to
tell
the
princess
has
been
ransacking
her
memory
all
about
her
affairs
with
your
cousin
she
more
certain
than
ever
now
that
nobody
in
russia
but
he
and
she
knew
anything
about
the
jewel
deal
they
were
always
in
strict
privacy
when
they
discussed
the
matter
no
one
was
present
when
she
gave
him
the
jewels
she
never
mentioned
the
affair
to
a
soul
and
she
confident
from
what
she
knew
of
him
that
he
would
so
she
more
convinced
than
ever
that
the
news
got
out
from
this
side
and
miss
lennard
what
did
she
want
asked
allerdyke
oh
she
found
the
various
references
two
or
three
of
that
she
had
with
the
french
maid
replied
fullaway
i
looked
at
them
nothing
in
them
but
what
you
expect
to
find
two
of
the
writers
are
society
women
the
third
was
a
french
marquise
i
do
think
anything
to
be
got
out
of
them
but
anyway
i
sent
her
off
to
scotland
yard
with
them
it
their
work
that
fine
photos
there
allerdyke
he
continued
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
album
some
of
your
places
in
bradford
eh
allerdyke
who
was
particularly
anxious
that
he
should
not
seem
to
have
had
an
ulterior
object
in
bringing
the
album
up
to
fullaway
office
hailed
this
question
with
relief
he
began
to
point
out
and
explain
the
various
pictures
photographs
of
his
mills
warehouses
town
office
his
own
private
house
grounds
surroundings
chatting
unconcernedly
about
each
and
while
the
two
men
were
thus
engaged
in
came
marlow
bringing
letters
which
needed
fullaway
signature
marlow
knows
more
about
amateur
photography
than
i
do
remarked
fullaway
with
a
glance
at
his
secretary
here
marlow
these
are
same
of
allerdyke
productions
you
remember
that
his
cousin
james
allerdyke
gave
you
a
photo
which
this
allerdyke
had
taken
allerdyke
keenly
watching
the
secretary
pretty
face
as
she
laid
her
papers
on
fullaway
desk
saw
no
sign
of
embarrassment
or
confusion
fullaway
might
have
made
the
most
innocent
and
ordinary
remark
in
the
world
and
yet
according
to
allerdyke
theory
and
positive
knowledge
it
must
be
fraught
with
serious
meaning
to
this
woman
oh
yes
she
flashed
without
as
much
as
the
flicker
of
an
eyelash
i
remember
a
particularly
good
photo
so
like
him
allerdyke
ingenuity
immediately
invented
a
remark
he
was
at
that
stage
when
he
wanted
to
know
as
much
as
possible
i
wonder
which
print
it
was
that
he
gave
you
he
said
one
of
them
i
only
did
a
few
had
a
spot
in
it
that
spread
if
that
the
one
you
got
i
give
you
another
in
its
place
marlow
have
you
got
it
here
but
marlow
shook
her
head
and
presented
the
same
unabashed
front
no
she
answered
readily
enough
i
took
it
home
allerdyke
but
there
no
spot
on
my
print
i
should
have
noticed
it
at
once
may
i
look
at
your
album
when
fullaway
finished
with
it
allerdyke
left
the
album
with
them
and
went
away
he
was
utterly
astonished
by
marlow
coolness
if
as
he
already
believed
she
was
mixed
up
in
the
murders
and
robberies
she
must
know
that
the
photograph
which
james
allerdyke
had
given
her
was
a
most
important
factor
and
yet
she
spoke
of
it
as
calmly
and
unconcernedly
as
if
it
had
been
a
mere
scrap
of
paper
of
course
she
had
got
it
at
the
office
nor
at
her
home
either
it
was
there
at
hull
fitted
into
the
cover
of
old
watch
a
cool
hand
soliloquized
allerdyke
as
he
went
downstairs
cool
clever
calm
never
off
her
guard
a
damned
dangerous
woman
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
and
what
next
experience
and
observation
of
life
had
taught
marshall
allerdyke
that
good
counsel
is
one
of
life
most
valuable
assets
he
could
think
for
himself
and
decide
for
himself
at
any
moment
but
he
knew
the
worth
and
value
of
putting
two
heads
together
especially
at
a
juncture
like
this
and
so
the
afternoon
being
still
young
he
went
off
to
his
warehouse
in
gresham
street
closeted
himself
with
ambler
appleyard
and
having
pledged
him
to
secrecy
told
him
all
that
had
happened
since
the
previous
morning
ambler
appleyard
listened
in
silence
it
was
only
two
or
three
hours
since
he
had
listened
to
another
story
the
report
of
the
two
gaffneys
and
allerdyke
all
unaware
of
that
business
had
come
upon
him
while
he
was
still
thinking
it
over
and
while
appleyard
gave
full
attention
to
all
that
his
employer
said
he
was
also
thinking
of
what
he
himself
could
tell
by
the
time
that
allerdyke
had
finished
he
too
had
decided
to
speak
so
there
it
is
my
lad
exclaimed
allerdyke
throwing
out
his
hands
with
an
eloquent
gesture
as
he
made
an
end
of
his
story
i
hope
i
put
it
clearly
to
you
it
just
as
that
chap
chettle
said
the
whole
secret
is
in
that
photograph
and
is
it
plain
that
photograph
must
have
been
transferred
somehow
by
this
marlow
to
this
lydenberg
how
why
when
we
can
answer
those
questions
he
paused
at
that
and
looking
fixedly
at
his
manager
shook
his
head
i
tell
you
what
it
is
ambler
he
went
on
after
a
moment
silence
i
got
a
good
strong
mind
to
go
straight
to
the
police
authorities
tell
what
i
know
insist
on
fetching
chettle
up
from
hull
at
once
and
having
that
woman
arrested
why
not
no
said
appleyard
firmly
not
yet
too
soon
allerdyke
wait
a
bit
and
now
listen
to
me
i
something
to
tell
you
i
been
busy
while
you
been
away
in
this
affair
bit
of
detective
work
i
tell
you
all
about
it
all
you
remember
that
day
i
went
to
lunch
with
you
at
the
city
carlton
and
you
pointed
out
this
marlow
to
me
going
into
rothschild
yes
well
i
recognized
her
you
did
exclaimed
allerdyke
nay
i
recognized
her
repeated
appleyard
i
said
naught
to
you
at
the
time
but
i
knew
her
well
enough
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
known
her
for
two
years
she
lives
at
the
same
the
pompadour
private
hotel
in
bayswater
that
i
live
in
i
see
her
have
been
seeing
her
for
two
years
every
day
morning
and
night
but
i
know
her
as
miss
slade
miss
ejaculated
allerdyke
miss
miss
slade
answered
appleyard
he
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
allerdyke
and
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
now
then
pay
attention
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
what
i
done
since
i
got
your
note
yesterday
morning
he
told
allerdyke
the
whole
story
of
his
endeavour
to
find
out
something
about
rayner
merely
because
rayner
seemed
to
be
in
miss
confidence
and
because
miss
slade
was
certainly
a
woman
of
mystery
and
allerdyke
listened
as
quietly
and
attentively
as
appleyard
had
listened
to
him
nodding
his
head
at
all
the
important
points
and
in
the
end
he
slapped
his
manager
shoulder
with
an
approving
hand
good
good
he
said
good
ambler
that
was
a
bit
of
right
work
and
hang
me
if
i
do
believe
we
shall
find
something
out
but
what
to
be
done
you
know
if
these
two
are
in
at
it
they
may
slip
that
never
do
i
do
think
there
any
fear
of
that
yet
answered
appleyard
the
probability
is
that
neither
has
any
suspicion
of
being
watched
the
whole
thing
so
clever
that
they
probably
believe
themselves
safe
of
course
mind
you
this
man
rayner
may
be
as
innocent
as
you
or
i
but
against
her
on
the
facts
of
that
photograph
affair
there
a
case
only
do
let
spoil
things
by
undue
haste
or
rashness
thought
things
out
a
good
deal
and
we
can
do
a
lot
you
and
me
before
going
to
the
police
though
i
do
think
it
do
any
harm
to
tell
this
man
chettle
supposing
he
were
here
because
his
discovery
of
that
photo
is
the
real
thing
what
can
we
do
then
asked
allerdyke
make
use
of
the
two
gaffneys
answered
appleyard
without
hesitation
they
smart
chaps
keen
we
want
to
find
out
who
rayner
is
what
his
connection
if
any
with
miss
slade
alias
marlow
is
who
she
is
and
why
she
goes
under
two
names
that
all
what
you
might
call
initial
proceedings
what
i
propose
is
this
when
you
go
back
to
your
hotel
get
gaffney
into
your
private
you
of
course
know
him
much
better
than
i
do
but
from
what
bit
i
seen
of
him
i
sure
he
the
sort
of
man
one
can
trust
tell
him
to
get
hold
of
that
brother
of
his
and
bring
him
here
at
any
hour
you
like
and
then
well
we
can
have
a
conference
and
decide
on
some
means
of
finding
out
more
about
rayner
and
keeping
an
eye
on
him
for
that
sort
of
work
i
should
say
that
other
gaffney
remarkably
well
cut
out
he
a
typical
sharp
knowing
cockney
with
all
his
wits
about
him
and
plenty
of
assurance
it
detective
work
you
know
ambler
said
allerdyke
it
needs
a
bit
of
more
than
ordinary
cuteness
from
my
observation
i
should
say
both
those
chaps
are
just
cut
for
it
answered
appleyard
with
a
laugh
what
more
they
enjoy
it
and
when
men
enjoy
what
they
doing
why
they
do
it
well
agreed
allerdyke
finishing
the
sentence
aye
that
true
enough
all
right
i
speak
to
gaffney
when
i
go
back
and
look
here
as
you
so
well
known
to
this
woman
miss
slade
or
marlow
whichever
her
name
is
you
better
not
show
up
at
the
waldorf
at
any
time
in
my
company
eh
of
course
said
appleyard
you
trust
me
for
that
what
we
got
to
do
must
be
done
as
secretly
as
possible
allerdyke
rose
to
go
but
turned
before
he
reached
the
door
there
one
thing
i
uneasy
about
he
said
if
i
say
if
of
course
if
these
folks
i
mean
the
lot
that
behind
this
woman
for
i
ca
believe
that
she
worked
it
all
herself
have
got
those
jewels
wo
they
want
to
clear
out
with
them
is
delay
dangerous
not
such
delay
as
i
thinking
of
answered
appleyard
firmly
cute
enough
this
lady
and
if
she
made
herself
scarce
just
now
know
very
well
that
it
would
excite
suspicion
do
let
spoil
things
by
being
too
previous
we
got
a
pretty
good
watch
on
her
you
know
i
should
know
very
quickly
if
she
cleared
out
of
the
pompadour
you
know
if
she
did
turn
up
at
fullaway
wait
a
bit
allerdyke
it
the
best
policy
you
come
here
eleven
in
the
morning
replied
allerdyke
i
fix
it
with
gaffney
he
went
back
to
the
waldorf
summoned
gaffney
to
his
private
room
and
sent
him
to
arrange
matters
with
his
brother
gaffney
accepted
the
commission
with
alacrity
his
brother
he
said
was
just
then
out
of
a
job
having
lost
a
clerkship
through
the
sudden
bankruptcy
of
his
employers
such
a
bit
of
business
as
that
which
appleyard
had
entrusted
to
him
was
so
much
meat
and
drink
to
one
of
his
tastes
in
more
ways
than
one
it
the
sort
of
thing
he
likes
sir
remarked
gaffney
confidentially
he
always
been
a
great
hand
at
reading
these
detective
tales
and
to
set
him
to
watch
anybody
is
like
offering
chickens
to
a
nigger
he
fair
revels
in
it
well
there
plenty
for
him
to
revel
in
observed
allerdyke
grimly
plenty
he
said
to
himself
with
a
cynical
laugh
when
gaffney
had
left
him
aye
plenty
and
to
spare
he
spent
the
whole
of
that
evening
alone
turning
every
detail
over
in
his
own
mind
he
was
still
thinking
and
speculating
and
putting
two
and
two
together
when
he
went
to
bed
at
eleven
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
switch
off
his
light
a
waiter
knocked
on
his
door
gentleman
downstairs
sir
very
anxious
to
see
you
at
once
he
said
when
allerdyke
opened
it
his
card
sir
allerdyke
gave
one
glance
at
the
card
a
plain
bit
of
pasteboard
on
which
one
word
had
been
hastily
pencilled
chettle
chapter
xx
number
chettle
whom
he
had
left
only
that
morning
in
hull
two
hundred
miles
away
both
of
them
agreed
that
the
next
step
was
still
unseen
and
that
immediate
action
was
yet
problematical
something
had
surely
happened
to
bring
chettle
up
to
town
and
to
him
show
chettle
up
here
at
once
he
said
to
the
waiter
and
here
bring
a
small
decanter
of
whisky
and
a
syphon
of
and
glasses
be
sharp
with
he
pulled
on
a
when
the
man
had
gone
and
tying
its
cord
about
his
waist
went
a
step
or
two
into
the
corridor
to
look
out
for
his
visitor
a
few
minutes
elapsed
then
the
lift
came
up
and
the
waiter
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
appeared
again
escorting
the
detective
and
carrying
a
tray
and
allerdyke
with
a
sly
wink
at
chettle
greeted
him
unconcernedly
ushered
him
into
his
room
and
chatted
about
nothing
until
the
waiter
had
gone
away
then
he
turned
on
him
eagerly
what
is
it
he
demanded
something
of
course
aught
new
for
answer
chettle
thrust
his
hand
inside
his
overcoat
and
brought
out
a
small
package
wrapped
in
cartridge
paper
and
sealed
he
began
to
break
the
seals
and
unwrap
the
covering
well
it
brought
me
up
here
straight
he
said
i
think
i
shall
have
to
let
our
people
at
the
yard
know
everything
allerdyke
but
i
came
to
you
first
only
got
to
king
cross
half
an
hour
ago
and
i
drove
on
to
you
at
once
well
see
what
you
think
before
i
decide
on
anything
what
is
it
repeated
allerdyke
gazing
with
interest
at
the
package
you
found
something
of
fresh
importance
eh
chettle
took
the
lid
off
a
small
box
and
produced
lydenberg
watch
and
postcard
on
which
the
appointment
in
the
high
street
had
been
made
he
sat
down
at
the
table
laying
his
hand
on
the
watch
after
you
left
me
this
morning
he
said
i
started
puzzling
and
puzzling
over
what
had
been
discovered
what
had
been
done
whether
there
was
more
that
i
could
do
i
kept
thinking
things
over
all
the
morning
and
half
the
afternoon
then
it
suddenly
struck
me
there
was
one
thing
that
i
never
done
and
that
ought
to
have
been
done
i
do
know
why
i
never
thought
of
it
till
then
but
i
never
had
this
photograph
out
of
the
watch
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
and
got
the
watch
and
opened
it
and
look
there
mr
allerdyke
he
had
snapped
open
the
case
of
the
watch
as
he
talked
and
he
now
detached
the
photograph
and
turning
it
over
laid
the
reverse
side
down
on
the
table
by
the
postcard
look
at
it
he
went
on
do
you
see
there
writing
on
it
you
see
what
it
says
is
burn
this
when
made
use
of
you
see
and
it
the
same
handwriting
as
that
on
this
card
making
the
appointment
here
look
at
both
for
yourself
hold
closer
to
the
light
allerdyke
that
was
all
written
by
the
same
hand
or
i
no
good
allerdyke
went
close
to
the
electric
globe
above
his
the
photograph
in
one
hand
the
postcard
in
the
other
he
looked
searchingly
at
both
brought
them
back
and
laid
them
down
again
no
doubt
of
it
chettle
he
said
no
doubt
of
it
it
does
need
any
expert
to
be
certain
sure
of
that
the
same
identical
fist
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
well
what
d
make
of
it
here
have
a
drink
he
mixed
a
couple
of
drinks
pushed
one
glass
to
the
detective
and
took
the
other
himself
egad
he
muttered
after
drinking
things
are
getting
hottish
anyway
as
i
say
what
do
you
make
of
this
of
course
you
come
to
some
conclusion
yes
answered
chettle
taking
up
his
glass
and
silently
bowing
his
acknowledgments
i
have
the
only
one
i
could
come
to
the
man
who
sent
this
photograph
to
lydenberg
to
help
him
to
identify
your
cousin
at
sight
is
the
man
who
afterwards
lured
lydenberg
into
that
part
of
hull
high
street
and
shot
him
dead
in
plain
words
the
master
shot
his
man
when
he
done
with
him
just
as
he
poisoned
the
frenchwoman
when
he
done
with
her
allerdyke
i
more
than
ever
convinced
that
these
two
murders
lydenberg
and
the
french
maid
were
the
work
of
one
hand
likely
assented
allerdyke
it
getting
to
look
like
it
but
whose
that
the
problem
chettle
well
i
done
a
bit
since
i
got
back
this
afternoon
you
had
something
to
tell
me
now
i
something
to
tell
you
i
found
out
who
it
was
that
james
gave
the
photograph
to
chettle
showed
his
gratification
by
a
start
of
pleased
surprise
you
have
already
he
exclaimed
already
replied
allerdyke
found
it
out
within
an
hour
of
getting
back
in
here
he
gave
it
here
though
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
and
there
was
no
fear
of
eavesdroppers
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
he
gave
it
to
fullaway
secretary
the
woman
we
discussed
marlow
that
a
fact
he
gave
it
to
her
just
before
he
set
off
for
russia
chettle
screwed
his
lips
up
to
whistle
instead
of
whistling
he
suddenly
relaxed
them
to
a
comprehending
smile
aye
just
so
he
said
i
was
sure
it
lay
somewhere
here
fullaway
himself
now
does
he
know
james
gave
it
to
her
in
fullaway
presence
replied
allerdyke
a
bit
of
a
photographer
i
understand
they
were
talking
about
photography
i
gathered
one
day
when
james
was
in
fullaway
office
and
james
pulled
that
out
and
gave
it
to
her
as
a
specimen
of
my
work
all
that
came
out
in
talk
this
afternoon
asked
chettle
just
so
ordinary
casual
talk
assented
allerdyke
no
suspicion
roused
suggested
chettle
i
do
think
so
of
course
you
never
can
tell
i
should
say
continued
allerdyke
that
she
as
deep
and
clever
as
ever
they
make
but
it
was
all
so
casual
and
so
natural
that
i
do
think
the
slightest
idea
that
i
was
trying
to
get
at
anything
however
i
found
this
much
out
she
could
produce
the
photograph
said
she
taken
it
home
well
there
we
are
that
part
one
of
my
bit
of
news
chettle
now
for
part
two
this
woman
leading
a
double
life
she
marlow
as
fullaway
secretary
and
here
at
his
rooms
and
on
his
business
where
she
lives
she
miss
slade
eh
chettle
pricked
his
ears
when
did
you
find
that
out
he
asked
since
you
left
me
this
morning
found
it
out
this
afternoon
replied
allerdyke
with
something
of
triumph
he
had
been
strolling
about
the
bedroom
up
to
that
moment
but
now
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
at
which
chettle
sat
and
dropped
into
it
close
beside
his
visitor
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
went
on
you
said
at
hull
yesterday
that
you
always
found
yorkshiremen
sharp
and
shrewd
well
this
is
a
bit
more
yorkshire
work
work
of
my
manager
here
in
town
appleyard
listen
he
gave
the
detective
a
clear
and
succinct
account
of
all
that
appleyard
and
his
satellites
had
done
and
chettle
listened
with
deep
attention
nodding
his
head
at
the
various
points
yes
he
said
when
allerdyke
had
made
an
end
yes
that
all
right
so
far
good
useful
work
the
thing
is
can
you
fully
trust
these
two
young
men
your
chauffeur
and
his
brother
i
could
and
would
trust
my
chauffeur
with
my
last
shilling
answered
allerdyke
and
as
for
his
brother
i
take
my
man
word
for
him
besides
they
both
know
or
gaffney
knows
that
i
a
pretty
generous
paymaster
if
a
man
does
aught
for
me
and
does
it
well
he
profits
to
a
nice
penny
a
good
argument
agreed
chettle
i
do
know
that
you
could
beat
it
allerdyke
well
well
we
getting
to
something
and
to
somewhere
now
as
you
told
me
all
this
i
just
keep
things
quiet
until
met
you
and
your
manager
with
these
two
gaffneys
we
have
a
conference
i
wo
go
near
the
yard
until
after
that
eleven
then
at
your
warehouse
in
gresham
street
he
presently
replaced
the
watch
and
the
postcard
in
an
inner
pocket
and
took
his
leave
and
allerdyke
letting
him
out
walked
along
the
corridor
with
him
as
far
as
the
lift
and
as
allerdyke
turned
back
to
his
own
room
the
third
event
of
that
day
happened
and
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
most
surprising
and
important
one
of
all
what
made
allerdyke
pause
as
he
retraced
his
steps
along
the
corridor
pause
to
look
over
the
balustrade
to
the
floor
immediately
below
his
own
he
never
knew
nor
could
explain
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
his
room
he
did
so
pause
leaning
over
the
railings
and
looking
down
for
a
moment
in
that
moment
he
saw
marlow
a
considerable
portion
of
the
floor
immediately
beneath
him
was
fully
exposed
to
the
view
of
any
one
leaning
over
the
balustrade
as
allerdyke
did
this
was
a
quiet
part
of
the
hotel
a
sort
of
wing
cut
away
from
the
main
building
the
floor
at
which
he
was
looking
was
given
up
to
private
suites
of
rooms
one
of
them
a
larger
one
than
the
others
being
fullaway
which
filled
one
side
of
the
corridor
the
others
were
suites
of
two
in
some
cases
of
three
rooms
as
he
looked
over
and
down
allerdyke
suddenly
saw
a
door
open
in
one
of
these
smaller
suites
open
silently
and
stealthily
then
he
saw
marlow
look
out
and
she
glanced
right
and
left
about
her
the
next
instant
she
emerged
from
the
room
with
the
same
stealthiness
closed
and
locked
the
door
with
a
key
which
she
immediately
pocketed
slipped
along
the
corridor
and
disappeared
into
franklin
fullaway
suite
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
a
minute
and
allerdyke
turned
into
his
own
door
smiling
cynically
to
himself
she
looked
right
and
left
but
she
forgot
to
look
up
he
muttered
ah
those
small
details
and
what
does
that
mean
anyway
i
know
which
door
she
came
out
of
he
glanced
at
his
watch
precisely
eleven
he
made
a
note
of
the
time
in
his
and
went
to
bed
and
next
morning
rising
early
as
was
his
custom
he
descended
to
the
ground
floor
by
means
of
the
stairs
instead
of
the
lift
and
as
he
passed
the
door
from
which
he
had
seen
marlow
emerge
he
mentally
registered
the
number
number
allerdyke
who
could
not
exist
without
fresh
air
and
exercise
went
for
a
stroll
before
breakfast
when
he
was
in
london
he
usually
chose
the
embankment
as
being
the
nearest
convenient
open
space
and
thither
he
now
repaired
thinking
things
over
there
were
many
new
features
of
this
affair
to
think
about
but
the
one
of
the
previous
night
now
occupied
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
what
was
this
woman
doing
coming
with
evident
secrecy
out
of
one
set
of
rooms
and
entering
another
at
that
late
hour
he
wanted
to
know
he
must
find
out
and
he
would
find
out
with
ease
and
indirectly
from
fullaway
fullaway
always
took
his
breakfast
at
a
certain
table
in
a
certain
corner
of
the
at
the
hotel
there
allerdyke
had
sometimes
joined
him
he
found
the
american
there
steadily
eating
when
he
returned
from
his
walk
and
he
dropped
into
a
chair
at
his
side
with
a
casual
remark
about
the
fine
morning
did
set
eyes
on
you
last
night
at
all
he
went
on
as
he
picked
up
his
napkin
off
somewhere
eh
spent
the
evening
out
answered
fullaway
not
often
i
do
but
i
did
for
once
in
a
way
van
koon
and
i
you
do
know
van
koon
do
you
he
a
fellow
countryman
of
mine
stopping
here
for
the
summer
and
a
very
clever
man
we
dined
at
the
carlton
and
then
went
to
the
haymarket
theatre
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
join
us
allerdyke
but
you
were
out
and
had
come
in
by
the
time
we
had
to
go
thank
you
no
i
did
get
in
until
seven
or
so
answered
allerdyke
so
i
a
quiet
evening
no
news
i
suppose
asked
fullaway
going
vigorously
forward
with
his
breakfast
heard
nothing
from
the
police
authorities
nothing
replied
allerdyke
i
suppose
they
doing
things
in
their
own
way
as
usual
just
so
assented
fullaway
well
it
an
odd
thing
to
me
that
nobody
comes
forward
to
make
some
sort
of
a
shot
at
that
reward
most
extraordinary
that
the
man
of
the
eastbourne
terrace
affair
should
have
been
able
to
get
clean
away
without
anybody
in
london
having
seen
him
or
at
any
rate
that
the
people
who
must
have
seen
him
are
unable
to
connect
him
with
the
murder
of
that
woman
extraordinary
it
all
extraordinary
said
allerdyke
he
took
up
a
newspaper
which
fullaway
had
thrown
down
and
began
to
talk
of
some
subject
that
caught
his
eye
until
fullaway
rose
pleaded
business
and
went
off
to
his
rooms
upstairs
when
he
had
gone
allerdyke
reconsidered
matters
so
fullaway
had
been
out
the
night
before
had
he
dining
out
and
at
a
theatre
then
of
course
it
would
be
quite
midnight
before
he
got
in
therefore
presumably
he
did
not
know
that
his
secretary
was
about
his
rooms
and
entering
and
leaving
another
suite
close
by
no
fullaway
knew
nothing
that
seemed
certain
the
remembrance
of
what
he
had
seen
sent
allerdyke
as
soon
as
he
had
breakfasted
to
the
hall
of
the
hotel
and
to
the
register
of
guests
there
was
no
one
at
the
register
at
that
moment
and
he
turned
the
pages
at
his
leisure
until
he
came
to
what
he
wanted
and
there
it
was
in
plain
black
and
white
number
john
van
koon
new
york
city
chapter
xxi
the
young
man
who
led
pugs
allerdyke
with
a
gesture
peculiar
to
him
thrust
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
strolled
away
from
the
desk
on
which
the
register
lay
open
and
going
over
to
the
hall
door
stood
there
a
while
staring
out
on
the
tide
of
life
that
rolled
by
and
listening
to
the
subdued
rattle
of
the
traffic
in
its
ceaseless
traverse
of
the
strand
and
as
he
stood
in
this
apparently
idle
and
purposeless
lounging
attitude
he
thought
thought
of
a
certain
birthday
of
his
a
good
thirty
years
before
whereon
a
kind
elderly
aunt
had
made
him
a
present
of
a
box
of
puzzles
there
were
all
sorts
of
puzzles
in
that
box
things
that
you
had
to
put
together
things
that
had
to
be
arranged
things
that
had
to
be
adjusted
but
there
was
one
in
particular
which
had
taken
his
youthful
fancy
and
had
at
the
same
time
tried
his
youthful
temper
a
shallow
tray
wherein
were
a
vast
quantity
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
of
bits
of
wood
gaily
coloured
there
were
quite
a
hundred
of
those
bits
and
you
had
to
fit
them
one
into
the
other
when
after
much
trying
of
temper
much
exercise
of
patience
you
had
accomplished
the
task
there
was
a
beautiful
bit
of
mosaic
work
a
picture
a
harmonious
whole
lovely
to
look
upon
something
worthy
of
the
admiring
approbation
of
uncles
and
aunts
grandmothers
and
grandfathers
but
the
doing
of
it
naught
however
to
this
confounded
thing
mused
allerdyke
gazing
at
and
not
seeing
the
folk
on
the
broad
sidewalk
when
all
the
bits
of
this
puzzle
have
been
fitted
into
place
i
daresay
one
be
able
to
look
down
on
it
as
a
whole
and
say
it
looks
simple
enough
when
finished
but
egad
they
of
so
many
sorts
and
shapes
and
queer
angles
that
more
than
a
bit
difficult
to
fit
at
present
now
who
the
deuce
is
this
van
koon
and
what
was
that
marlow
alias
miss
slade
doing
in
his
rooms
last
night
when
he
was
out
he
was
exercising
his
brains
over
a
possible
solution
of
this
problem
when
fullaway
suddenly
appeared
in
the
hall
behind
him
accompanied
by
a
man
whom
allerdyke
at
once
took
to
be
the
very
individual
about
whom
he
was
speculating
he
was
a
man
of
apparently
forty
years
of
age
of
average
height
and
build
of
a
full
countenance
sallow
in
complexion
wearing
spectacles
over
a
pair
of
sapphire
blue
eyes
a
shrewd
man
clad
in
the
loose
fitting
garments
just
then
affected
by
his
and
having
a
soft
straw
hat
pulled
down
over
his
forehead
his
hands
were
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
a
long
thin
black
cigar
stuck
out
of
a
corner
of
his
lips
he
cocked
an
intelligent
eye
at
allerdyke
as
he
and
fullaway
advanced
to
the
door
hullo
allerdyke
said
fullaway
in
his
usual
vivacious
fashion
viewing
the
prospect
eh
allow
me
to
introduce
van
koon
whom
i
do
think
you
met
though
he
under
the
same
roof
van
koon
this
is
the
allerdyke
i
mentioned
to
you
the
two
men
shook
hands
and
stared
at
each
other
whoever
and
whatever
this
man
may
be
thought
allerdyke
he
gives
you
a
straight
look
and
a
good
grip
two
characteristics
which
in
his
opinion
went
far
to
establish
any
unknown
individual
honesty
no
remarked
van
koon
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
allerdyke
before
but
i
out
a
great
deal
i
do
spend
much
time
indoors
this
fine
weather
you
gentlemen
know
your
london
well
i
do
and
i
putting
in
all
the
time
i
can
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
been
in
town
long
asked
allerdyke
wanting
to
say
something
and
impelled
to
this
apparently
trite
question
by
the
new
yorker
own
observations
since
the
first
week
in
april
answered
van
koon
and
as
this
is
my
first
visit
to
england
i
endeavouring
to
do
everything
well
fullaway
tells
me
allerdyke
that
you
come
from
bradford
the
big
manufacturing
city
up
north
well
now
bradford
is
one
of
the
places
on
my
list
hullo
he
exclaimed
breaking
off
short
i
guess
here
a
man
who
wanting
you
fullaway
in
a
considerable
bit
of
a
hurry
fullaway
and
allerdyke
looked
out
on
to
the
pavement
and
saw
blindway
who
had
just
jumped
out
of
a
and
was
advancing
upon
them
he
came
up
and
addressed
them
jointly
would
they
go
back
with
him
at
once
to
new
scotland
yard
the
chief
wanted
to
see
them
for
a
few
minutes
come
on
allerdyke
said
fullaway
we
better
go
at
once
van
koon
he
continued
turning
to
his
compatriot
do
me
a
favour
just
look
in
at
my
rooms
upstairs
and
tell
marlow
if
she
come
she
arrived
when
i
was
up
there
ten
minutes
ago
that
i
called
out
for
an
hour
or
so
ask
her
to
attend
to
anything
that
turns
up
until
i
come
back
sha
be
long
van
koon
nodded
and
walked
back
into
the
hotel
while
allerdyke
and
fullaway
joined
the
detective
in
the
cab
and
set
out
westward
what
is
it
asked
fullaway
something
new
ca
say
exactly
replied
blindway
the
chief
got
some
woman
there
who
thinks
she
can
tell
something
about
the
french
maid
so
he
sent
me
for
you
and
he
sent
another
man
for
miss
lennard
it
may
be
something
good
it
may
otherwise
he
concluded
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
was
almost
dismal
otherwise
i
do
know
of
anything
new
never
knew
of
a
case
in
my
life
gentlemen
in
which
less
turned
up
than
turning
up
in
this
affair
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
going
i
suppose
this
woman
after
it
remarked
fullaway
you
did
hear
of
anything
she
had
to
tell
nothing
answered
blindway
you
hear
it
in
a
minute
or
two
he
took
them
straight
up
into
the
same
room
and
the
same
official
whom
they
had
previously
seen
and
who
now
sat
at
his
desk
with
celia
lennard
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
woman
evidently
of
the
poorer
classes
on
the
other
allerdyke
and
fullaway
after
a
brief
interchange
of
salutations
with
the
official
and
the
prima
donna
looked
at
the
stranger
a
quiet
woman
who
united
a
natural
shyness
with
an
evident
determination
to
go
through
with
the
business
that
had
brought
her
there
she
was
just
the
sort
of
woman
who
can
be
seen
by
the
hundred
laundress
seamstress
charwoman
caretaker
got
up
in
her
sunday
best
odd
indeed
it
would
be
thought
allerdyke
if
this
quiet
creature
should
give
information
which
would
place
fifty
thousand
pounds
at
her
command
this
is
perrigo
said
the
chief
pleasantly
as
he
motioned
the
two
men
to
chairs
near
celia
and
beckoned
blindway
to
his
side
perrigo
of
where
is
it
i
live
in
alpha
place
off
park
street
sir
announced
perrigo
in
a
small
quiet
voice
number
sir
i
a
by
trade
sir
put
that
down
blindway
said
the
chief
and
take
a
note
of
what
perrigo
tells
us
now
perrigo
you
think
you
seen
the
dead
woman
lisette
beaurepaire
at
some
time
or
another
in
company
with
a
young
man
where
and
when
was
this
well
three
times
sir
three
times
that
i
certain
of
there
was
another
time
that
i
was
certain
about
at
least
that
i
not
certain
about
now
if
i
could
just
tell
you
about
it
in
my
way
sir
certainly
certainly
perrigo
exactly
what
i
wish
tell
us
all
about
it
in
your
own
way
take
your
own
time
well
sir
it
be
as
near
as
i
can
fix
it
about
the
middle
of
march
two
months
ago
sir
began
perrigo
you
see
i
had
the
misfortune
to
burn
my
right
hand
very
badly
sir
and
having
to
put
my
work
aside
and
it
being
nice
weather
and
warm
for
the
time
of
year
i
used
to
go
and
sit
in
kensington
gardens
a
good
deal
which
of
course
was
when
i
see
this
young
lady
whose
picture
been
in
the
paper
of
late
and
a
moment
perrigo
interrupted
the
official
miss
lennard
it
will
simplify
matters
considerably
if
i
ask
you
a
question
were
you
and
your
late
maid
in
town
about
the
time
perrigo
speaks
of
the
middle
of
march
yes
replied
celia
promptly
we
were
here
from
march
when
we
came
back
from
the
continent
to
march
when
we
left
for
russia
continue
perrigo
if
you
please
said
the
official
take
your
time
tell
things
your
own
way
yes
sir
said
perrigo
dutifully
if
you
please
sir
well
when
i
see
those
pictures
in
the
papers
several
papers
sir
of
the
young
lady
with
the
foreign
name
i
says
to
myself
and
to
my
neighbour
watson
which
is
all
i
ever
talk
much
to
i
says
the
young
woman
i
see
in
kensington
gardens
a
time
or
two
and
remarks
of
for
her
elegant
figure
and
smart
air
in
general
i
could
have
picked
her
out
from
a
thousand
i
says
which
there
was
and
is
a
particular
spot
sir
in
kensington
gardens
where
i
used
to
sit
and
you
pays
a
penny
for
a
chair
which
i
did
and
there
other
chairs
about
near
a
fallen
tree
which
is
still
there
for
i
went
to
make
sure
last
night
and
there
on
three
afternoons
while
i
was
there
this
young
lady
came
at
about
say
four
each
time
and
was
met
by
this
here
young
man
what
i
do
remember
as
clear
as
i
remember
her
me
not
taking
so
much
notice
of
him
and
another
moment
mrs
perrigo
the
chief
turned
again
to
celia
did
your
maid
ever
go
out
in
the
afternoons
about
that
time
he
asked
probably
every
afternoon
replied
celia
i
myself
was
away
from
london
from
the
to
the
of
march
staying
with
friends
in
the
country
i
did
take
her
with
me
so
of
course
she
nothing
to
do
but
follow
her
own
inclinations
the
chief
turned
to
perrigo
again
yes
he
said
you
saw
the
young
woman
whose
photograph
you
have
seen
in
the
papers
meet
a
young
man
in
kensington
gardens
on
three
separate
occasions
yes
three
separate
occasions
close
by
on
penny
chairs
sir
where
they
sat
and
talked
foreign
which
i
did
understand
and
on
another
occasion
when
i
see
walking
by
the
round
pond
me
being
at
some
distance
but
recognizing
her
by
her
elegant
figure
i
took
particular
notice
of
the
young
woman
face
sir
me
being
a
noticing
person
and
i
take
my
dying
oath
if
need
be
that
this
here
picture
is
hers
perrigo
here
produced
a
much
worn
and
crumpled
illustrated
newspaper
and
laid
her
hand
solemnly
upon
it
that
done
she
shook
her
head
but
i
ai
so
certain
about
the
young
man
as
met
her
she
said
sorrowfully
him
i
did
not
notice
with
such
attention
being
as
i
say
more
attracted
to
her
all
the
same
he
was
a
young
man
and
spoke
the
same
foreign
language
as
what
she
did
of
them
facts
sure
i
am
sir
they
sat
near
you
mrs
perrigo
as
near
sir
as
i
am
now
to
that
lady
and
paid
their
pennies
for
their
chairs
in
my
presence
leastways
the
young
man
paid
always
the
same
place
it
was
and
always
the
same
time
three
days
all
within
a
week
and
then
the
day
when
i
see
walking
at
a
distance
ca
you
remember
anything
about
the
young
man
mrs
perrigo
asked
the
chief
come
try
to
think
that
is
the
really
important
thing
you
must
have
some
recollection
of
him
you
know
some
idea
of
what
he
was
like
perrigo
took
a
corner
of
her
shawl
between
her
fingers
and
proceeded
to
fold
and
pleat
it
while
she
thoughtfully
fixed
her
eyes
on
unmoved
countenance
as
if
to
find
inspiration
there
and
after
a
time
she
nodded
her
head
as
though
memory
had
stirred
within
her
which
every
time
i
see
him
she
said
with
an
evident
quickening
of
interest
he
had
two
of
them
dogs
with
him
what
has
noses
and
twisted
tails
pugs
suggested
the
chief
no
doubt
that
is
their
name
sir
but
unbeknown
to
me
as
i
never
kept
such
an
animal
answered
perrigo
my
meaning
being
clear
no
doubt
and
there
being
no
mistaking
of
their
tails
and
noses
being
of
that
order
and
had
always
on
a
chain
gentlemen
dogs
you
could
see
they
was
and
carefully
looked
after
with
blue
bows
at
the
back
of
their
necks
same
as
if
they
was
christians
and
him
i
should
say
speaking
from
memory
a
dark
young
man
such
is
my
recollection
it
comes
to
this
remarked
the
chief
looking
at
the
three
listeners
with
a
smile
perrigo
says
that
she
is
certain
that
upon
three
occasions
about
the
middle
of
march
last
she
witnessed
meetings
at
a
particular
spot
in
kensington
gardens
between
a
young
woman
answering
the
description
and
photographs
of
lisette
beaurepaire
and
a
young
man
of
whom
she
can
not
definitely
remember
anything
except
that
she
thinks
he
was
dark
spoke
a
foreign
language
and
was
in
charge
of
two
pug
dogs
which
wore
blue
ribbons
that
it
is
it
mrs
perrigo
and
willing
to
take
my
solemn
oath
of
the
same
whenever
convenient
sir
replied
perrigo
and
if
so
be
as
what
i
told
you
should
lead
to
anything
gentlemen
and
lady
i
can
assure
you
that
me
being
a
poor
widow
and
five
minutes
later
perrigo
with
some
present
reward
in
her
pocket
was
walking
quietly
up
whitehall
with
a
composed
countenance
while
allerdyke
already
late
for
his
gresham
street
appointment
sped
towards
the
city
as
fast
as
a
hastily
chartered
could
carry
him
and
all
the
way
thither
being
alone
he
repeated
certain
words
over
and
over
again
a
dark
young
man
who
led
two
pugs
a
dark
young
man
who
led
two
pugs
with
blue
ribbons
on

chapter
xxii
thick
fog
it
was
eleven
when
allerdyke
reached
gresham
street
by
one
so
curiously
and
rapidly
did
events
crowd
upon
each
other
he
was
in
a
state
of
complete
mental
confusion
he
sat
down
to
lunch
that
day
feeling
as
a
man
feels
who
has
lost
his
way
in
an
unknown
country
in
the
midst
of
a
blinding
mist
as
a
weaver
might
feel
who
is
at
work
on
an
intricate
pattern
and
suddenly
finds
all
his
threads
inextricably
mixed
up
and
tangled
instead
of
things
getting
better
and
clearer
that
morning
work
made
them
more
hopelessly
muddled
chettle
was
hanging
about
the
door
of
the
warehouse
when
allerdyke
drove
up
his
usually
sly
look
was
accentuated
that
morning
and
as
soon
as
allerdyke
stepped
from
his
cab
he
drew
him
aside
with
a
meaning
gesture
a
word
or
two
before
we
go
in
allerdyke
he
said
as
they
walked
a
few
steps
along
the
street
look
here
sir
he
went
on
in
a
whisper
i
been
reflecting
on
things
since
i
saw
you
last
night
of
course
i
supposed
to
be
in
hull
you
know
but
i
shall
have
to
report
myself
at
the
yard
this
morning
ca
avoid
that
and
i
shall
have
to
tell
them
why
i
came
up
now
it
here
allerdyke
how
much
or
how
little
shall
i
tell
what
i
mean
sir
is
this
do
you
want
to
keep
any
of
this
recently
acquired
knowledge
to
yourself
of
course
if
you
do
well
i
need
tell
any
more
there
at
headquarters
than
you
wish
me
to
tell
i
can
easy
make
excuse
for
coming
up
and
of
course
in
that
case
well
demanded
allerdyke
impatiently
what
then
chettle
gave
him
another
look
of
suggestive
meaning
and
taking
off
his
square
felt
hat
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
big
coloured
handkerchief
well
of
course
allerdyke
he
said
insinuatingly
of
course
sir
i
a
poor
man
and
i
a
rising
family
that
i
want
to
do
my
best
for
i
could
do
with
a
substantial
amount
of
that
reward
you
know
allerdyke
we
all
a
right
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
ourselves
sir
and
if
you
wanting
to
follow
this
affair
out
on
your
own
sir
independent
of
the
police
eh
allerdyke
sense
of
duty
arose
in
strong
protest
against
this
very
palpable
suggestion
he
shook
his
head
no
no
he
said
that
wo
do
chettle
you
must
do
your
duty
to
your
superiors
you
find
that
you
be
all
right
if
the
police
solve
this
affair
that
reward
go
to
the
police
and
you
get
your
proper
share
no
no
underhand
work
you
make
your
report
in
your
ordinary
way
no
more
of
that
aye
but
do
you
understand
mr
allerdyke
said
the
detective
anxiously
do
you
comprehend
what
it
mean
you
know
very
well
that
there
a
lot
of
red
tape
in
our
work
they
go
a
great
deal
by
rule
and
precedent
as
you
might
say
now
if
i
go
to
the
yard
as
i
shall
have
to
as
soon
as
you
done
with
me
and
tell
the
chief
that
i
found
this
photo
of
your
cousin
in
lydenberg
watch
and
that
you
certain
that
your
cousin
gave
that
particular
photo
to
marlow
alias
miss
slade
do
you
know
what
happen
what
asked
allerdyke
they
arrest
her
within
half
an
hour
answered
chettle
dead
certain
well
said
allerdyke
and
what
then
why
it
probably
upset
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
exclaimed
chettle
the
thing
be
spoiled
before
we
properly
worked
it
out
see
allerdyke
did
see
he
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
police
matters
to
know
that
chettle
was
right
and
that
a
too
hasty
step
would
probably
ruin
everything
he
turned
towards
the
warehouse
just
so
he
said
i
take
your
meaning
now
then
come
in
and
put
it
before
my
manager
appleyard
i
great
faith
in
his
judgment
let
see
what
he
got
to
say
the
two
gaffneys
were
waiting
just
within
the
packingroom
of
the
warehouse
allerdyke
bade
them
wait
a
little
longer
and
took
the
detective
straight
into
appleyard
office
there
behind
the
closed
door
he
told
appleyard
of
everything
that
had
happened
since
their
last
meeting
and
of
what
chettle
had
just
said
the
problem
was
in
view
of
all
that
of
the
mysterious
proceedings
of
marlow
the
night
before
and
of
what
allerdyke
had
just
heard
at
new
scotland
yard
what
was
best
to
be
done
severally
and
collectively
by
all
of
them
ambler
appleyard
grasped
the
situation
at
once
and
solved
the
problem
in
a
few
direct
words
there
was
no
need
whatever
he
said
for
chettle
to
do
more
than
his
plain
duty
no
need
for
him
to
exceed
it
he
was
bound
being
what
he
was
to
make
his
report
about
his
discovery
of
the
photograph
and
the
writing
on
it
that
he
must
do
but
he
was
not
bound
to
tell
anything
that
allerdyke
had
told
him
he
was
not
bound
to
give
information
which
allerdyke
had
collected
let
chettle
go
and
tell
the
plain
facts
about
his
own
knowledge
of
the
photo
and
leave
allerdyke
for
the
moment
clean
out
of
the
question
allerdyke
himself
could
go
with
his
news
in
due
course
and
wound
up
appleyard
who
had
a
keen
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
saw
deep
into
chettle
mind
allerdyke
would
doubtless
see
that
chettle
lost
nothing
by
holding
his
tongue
about
anything
that
was
exactly
ripe
for
discussion
at
present
he
repeated
let
chettle
do
his
duty
not
exceed
it
that
it
agreed
allerdyke
you
hit
it
ambler
you
go
and
tell
what
you
know
of
your
own
knowledge
he
went
on
turning
to
chettle
leave
me
clean
out
for
the
time
being
i
come
in
at
the
right
moment
say
naught
about
me
or
of
what
i
told
you
and
if
you
sent
back
to
hull
just
contrive
to
see
me
before
you
go
and
as
appleyard
says
i
see
you
all
right
anyhow
when
chettle
had
gone
allerdyke
closed
the
door
on
him
and
turned
to
his
manager
with
a
knowing
look
that
chap
right
you
know
ambler
he
said
a
false
move
a
too
hasty
step
ruin
everything
if
that
woman
startled
if
she
gets
a
suspicion
egad
it
all
mixed
up
about
as
badly
as
can
be
now
about
these
gaffneys
wait
a
while
said
appleyard
i
do
know
that
we
want
their
services
just
yet
i
found
out
a
thing
or
two
that
may
be
useful
about
this
man
rayner
now
who
in
evident
close
touch
with
miss
slade
by
the
by
you
saw
her
at
the
waldorf
at
eleven
last
night
and
i
saw
her
come
into
the
pompadour
at
twelve
with
rayner
and
about
whom
we
accordingly
want
to
know
something
i
found
out
through
ordinary
business
channels
that
he
does
carry
on
a
business
at
clytemnestra
house
in
arundel
street
under
the
name
of
gavin
ramsay
and
if
we
want
to
know
more
of
him
i
an
idea
you
go
and
see
him
allerdyke
on
business
i
business
exclaimed
allerdyke
what
sort
of
business
he
an
inventor
agent
replied
appleyard
it
a
profession
i
never
heard
of
before
but
he
seems
to
act
as
a
folks
that
have
got
an
invention
go
to
him
he
helps
about
it
helps
to
perfect
it
patent
it
get
it
on
the
market
you
a
good
excuse
there
that
patent
railway
chair
of
your
man
gankrodgers
been
lying
there
in
that
corner
for
the
past
year
and
you
promised
gankrodgers
you
help
him
about
it
put
it
in
a
cab
and
go
to
this
rayner
or
ramsay
there
your
excuse
and
you
can
say
you
heard
of
him
in
the
city
from
wilmingtons
it
was
they
who
told
me
what
he
was
it
a
good
notion
mr
allerdyke
what
object
asked
allerdyke
simply
to
get
a
look
at
him
replied
appleyard
look
here
you
know
very
well
that
there
a
strong
suspicion
against
miss
slade
miss
slade
to
my
knowledge
is
in
close
touch
with
rayner
therefore
let
know
what
we
can
about
rayner
you
the
man
to
go
and
see
him
at
his
own
place
do
it
and
we
consider
the
question
of
having
him
watched
by
the
two
gaffneys
when
you
seen
and
talked
to
him
allerdyke
considered
this
somewhat
strange
proposal
in
silence
for
a
while
at
last
he
rose
with
a
look
of
decision
well
i
certainly
a
good
excuse
he
said
here
have
that
thing
packed
up
and
put
in
a
cab
i
go
half
an
hour
later
he
found
himself
shown
into
a
smartly
furnished
office
where
gavin
ramsay
sat
at
a
handsome
desk
surrounded
by
shelves
and
cabinets
whereon
and
wherein
were
set
out
the
products
of
the
brains
of
many
inventors
models
of
machines
mechanical
toys
notions
things
plainly
useful
things
obviously
extravagant
the
occupant
of
this
museum
glanced
at
allerdyke
and
the
box
which
he
carried
with
an
amused
smile
and
allerdyke
said
to
himself
that
appleyard
was
right
in
his
description
if
the
man
was
crippled
and
deformed
he
certainly
possessed
a
beautiful
face
marshall
allerdyke
said
the
hope
of
inventors
glancing
at
the
card
which
his
visitor
had
sent
in
the
same
sir
replied
allerdyke
setting
down
his
box
ramsay
i
presume
i
heard
of
you
ramsay
through
wilmingtons
in
the
city
heard
you
can
be
of
great
use
to
inventors
i
have
here
he
continued
opening
the
box
a
railway
chair
invented
by
one
of
my
workmen
a
clever
fellow
you
see
it
do
away
with
the
present
system
of
putting
wooden
blocks
in
the
chairs
now
used
this
would
fasten
the
sleepers
and
rails
together
automatically
it
is
patented
provisionally
protected
anyhow
but
my
man
never
got
a
railway
company
to
try
it
so
far
think
you
can
do
anything
mr
ramsay
the
hunchback
got
up
from
his
desk
took
the
invention
out
of
its
box
and
carefully
inspected
it
asking
allerdyke
a
few
shrewd
questions
about
the
thing
possibilities
which
showed
the
caller
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
then
he
sat
down
again
and
went
into
business
details
in
a
way
which
impressed
allerdyke
clearly
this
man
whoever
he
was
and
whatever
mystery
might
attach
to
him
was
a
smart
individual
also
he
had
a
frank
direct
way
of
talking
which
gave
his
visitor
a
very
good
first
opinion
of
him
very
well
allerdyke
he
said
in
conclusion
leave
the
thing
with
me
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
as
i
say
the
proper
course
will
be
to
get
it
tried
on
one
of
the
smaller
railway
lines
if
it
answers
there
we
can
perhaps
induce
one
of
the
bigger
companies
to
take
it
up
i
do
my
best
allerdyke
thanked
him
and
rose
he
had
certainly
done
something
for
his
man
gankrodgers
and
he
had
seen
ramsay
or
rayner
at
close
quarters
but
ramsay
was
speaking
again
he
had
picked
up
allerdyke
card
and
glanced
from
it
to
its
presenter
half
shyly
you
the
cousin
of
the
allerdyke
whose
name
been
in
the
papers
so
much
in
connection
with
this
murder
and
robbery
affair
i
suppose
he
said
i
seen
your
own
name
of
course
in
the
various
accounts
i
am
replied
allerdyke
he
had
moved
towards
the
door
but
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
questioner
you
followed
it
then
he
asked
yes
assented
ramsay
closely
a
curiously
intricate
case
any
solution
of
it
present
itself
to
your
mind
asked
allerdyke
in
his
brusque
downright
fashion
got
any
theory
ramsay
smiled
and
shook
his
finely
shaped
head
he
too
rose
walking
towards
the
door
it
a
little
early
for
that
is
it
he
said
i
studied
these
affairs
criminology
you
know
for
many
years
in
my
opinion
it
a
mistake
to
be
too
hasty
in
trying
to
arrive
at
solutions
but
he
added
with
a
shrug
of
his
misshapen
shoulders
it
always
the
way
of
the
police
and
of
most
folk
who
try
to
get
at
the
truth
things
that
are
deep
down
need
some
deep
digging
for
there
the
question
of
the
present
whereabouts
of
nearly
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewels
remarked
allerdyke
grimly
remember
that
quite
so
agreed
ramsay
but
your
own
particular
and
personal
desire
as
i
gather
from
the
newspapers
is
to
find
the
murderer
of
your
cousin
ah
said
allerdyke
and
it
is
got
any
ideas
on
that
point
ramsay
smiled
as
he
opened
the
door
i
think
he
said
with
a
quiet
significance
i
think
that
you
be
having
all
this
mystery
explained
and
cleared
up
all
of
a
sudden
allerdyke
in
a
way
that
surprise
you
these
things
are
like
warfare
there
a
sudden
turn
of
events
a
sudden
big
event
just
when
you
not
expecting
it
well
thank
you
for
giving
me
a
chance
with
your
man
invention
allerdyke
found
himself
walking
up
arundel
street
before
he
had
quite
realized
that
this
curious
interview
was
over
at
the
top
he
paused
staring
vacantly
at
the
folk
who
passed
and
repassed
along
the
strand
i
lay
a
pound
to
a
penny
that
chap
all
right
he
muttered
to
himself
he
not
a
wrong
unless
he
damned
deceitful
all
the
same
he
knows
something
what
my
conscience
was
there
ever
such
a
confounded
muddle
in
this
world
as
this
is
but
the
muddle
was
a
deeper
one
within
the
next
few
minutes
he
crossed
over
to
his
hotel
and
as
he
was
entering
he
met
marlow
coming
out
fresh
dainty
charming
as
usual
she
stopped
at
sight
of
him
and
held
up
the
little
which
hung
from
her
wrist
oh
mr
allerdyke
she
said
opening
the
bag
and
taking
an
envelope
from
it
i
something
for
you
see
here
the
photograph
your
cousin
gave
me
you
were
wrong
you
see
there
no
spot
in
it
it
a
particularly
clear
print
look
in
allerdyke
big
palm
she
laid
the
very
photograph
which
according
to
all
his
reckoning
was
that
which
chettle
had
found
within
the
cover
of
lydenberg
watch
chapter
xxiii
the
possible
death
warrant
quite
a
clear
print
you
see
repeated
marlow
brightly
no
spot
there
you
must
have
been
thinking
of
another
aye
just
so
replied
allerdyke
absentmindedly
another
yes
of
course
aye
to
be
sure
you
right
no
spot
on
that
certainly
he
was
talking
aimlessly
confusedly
as
he
turned
the
print
over
in
his
hand
examining
it
back
and
front
and
having
no
excuse
for
keeping
it
he
handed
it
back
with
a
keen
look
at
its
owner
what
the
devil
he
asked
himself
was
this
mysterious
woman
playing
at
i
going
to
have
this
mounted
and
framed
said
marlow
as
she
put
the
photograph
back
in
her
bag
and
turned
to
go
i
misplaced
it
some
time
ago
and
could
lay
hands
on
it
but
i
came
across
it
by
accident
this
morning
so
now
i
take
care
of
it
she
nodded
smiled
and
went
off
into
the
sunlight
outside
and
allerdyke
more
puzzled
than
ever
walked
forward
into
the
hotel
and
towards
the
restaurant
at
its
door
he
met
fullaway
coming
out
and
in
his
usual
hurry
fullaway
started
at
sight
of
allerdyke
him
and
led
him
into
a
corner
oh
i
say
allerdyke
he
said
in
his
bustling
fashion
look
here
a
word
with
you
you
no
objection
have
you
he
went
on
in
subdued
tones
if
van
koon
and
i
have
a
try
for
that
reward
it
does
matter
to
you
or
to
the
princess
or
to
miss
lennard
who
gets
the
reward
so
long
as
the
criminals
are
brought
to
justice
and
the
goods
found
eh
and
you
know
fifty
thousand
is
what
it
is
you
got
an
idea
asked
allerdyke
regarding
his
questioner
steadily
frankly
yes
an
idea
a
notion
answered
fullaway
van
koon
and
i
have
been
discussing
the
whole
affair
just
now
he
a
smart
man
and
has
had
experience
in
these
things
on
the
other
side
but
of
course
we
do
want
to
give
our
idea
away
we
want
to
work
in
entire
independence
of
the
police
for
instance
what
we
thinking
of
requires
patience
and
deep
investigation
so
we
want
to
work
on
our
own
methods
see
it
does
matter
to
me
who
gets
the
reward
as
you
say
said
allerdyke
slowly
i
want
justice
i
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
jewels
as
about
who
killed
my
cousin
i
believe
that
man
lydenberg
did
the
actual
killing
but
who
was
at
lydenberg
back
find
that
out
and
exactly
exactly
broke
in
fullaway
the
very
thing
well
you
understand
allerdyke
van
koon
and
i
will
want
to
keep
our
operations
to
ourselves
we
do
want
police
interference
so
if
any
of
these
scotland
yard
chaps
come
to
you
here
for
talk
or
information
do
bring
me
into
it
and
do
expect
me
to
tell
what
we
doing
until
carried
out
our
investigations
no
interim
reports
you
know
allerdyke
personally
i
believe
we
on
the
track
do
just
what
you
please
replied
allerdyke
you
not
the
only
two
who
are
after
that
reward
go
ahead
your
own
way
he
turned
into
the
restaurant
and
ordered
his
lunch
and
while
it
was
being
brought
sat
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
table
staring
vacantly
at
the
people
about
him
and
wondering
over
the
events
of
the
morning
rayner
or
ramsay
vague
hint
that
something
might
suddenly
clear
everything
up
fullaway
announcement
that
he
and
van
koon
had
put
their
heads
together
perrigo
story
of
the
french
maid
and
the
young
man
who
led
but
all
these
were
as
nothing
compared
to
the
fact
that
marlow
had
actually
shown
him
the
photograph
which
he
had
until
then
firmly
believed
to
lie
hidden
in
the
case
of
watch
that
beat
him
is
my
blessed
memory
going
wrong
he
said
to
himself
did
i
actually
print
more
than
four
copies
of
that
thing
no
no
i
shot
if
i
did
my
memory
never
fails
i
did
not
print
off
more
than
four
james
had
three
i
had
one
mine
in
my
album
upstairs
i
know
what
james
did
with
his
cousin
grace
has
one
wilson
firth
has
another
he
gave
the
third
to
this
marlow
and
she
got
it
then
how
the
devil
did
that
photograph
which
looks
to
be
of
my
taking
which
i
swear
is
of
my
taking
come
to
be
in
lydenberg
watch
gad
it
enough
to
make
a
man
brain
turn
to
pap
he
was
moodily
finishing
his
lunch
when
chettle
came
in
to
find
him
allerdyke
who
was
in
a
quiet
corner
beckoned
the
detective
to
a
seat
and
offered
him
a
drink
well
he
asked
what
been
done
it
all
right
answered
chettle
i
told
no
more
than
was
necessary
just
what
we
agreed
upon
to
tell
you
the
truth
our
folks
do
attach
such
tremendous
importance
to
it
they
will
of
course
when
you
tell
them
your
story
about
the
photo
just
at
present
they
merely
see
the
obvious
fact
that
lydenberg
was
furnished
with
the
photo
as
a
means
of
ready
identification
of
your
brother
no
at
this
moment
they
full
of
the
perrigo
woman
story
they
think
that
a
sure
clue
a
good
beginning
somebody
they
say
must
own
or
have
owned
those
pugs
therefore
they
going
strong
on
that
meanwhile
i
going
back
to
hull
for
at
any
rate
a
few
days
you
still
got
that
watch
on
you
asked
allerdyke
certainly
answered
chettle
clapping
his
hand
to
his
technically
speaking
it
in
charge
of
the
hull
police
it
have
to
be
produced
there
did
you
want
to
see
it
again
mr
allerdyke
finish
your
drink
and
come
up
to
my
said
allerdyke
give
you
a
cigar
up
there
yes
he
added
as
they
left
the
restaurant
and
went
upstairs
i
do
want
to
see
it
again
or
rather
the
photograph
you
in
no
hurry
a
good
hour
to
spare
yet
replied
chettle
allerdyke
locked
the
door
of
the
when
they
were
once
inside
it
and
that
done
he
placed
a
decanter
a
syphon
and
a
glass
on
his
table
and
flanked
them
with
a
box
of
cigars
he
waved
a
hospitable
hand
towards
these
comforts
sit
down
and
help
yourself
chettle
he
said
a
drop
of
my
do
you
no
harm
that
some
i
got
down
from
home
and
you
not
find
its
like
everywhere
light
a
cigar
and
put
a
couple
in
your
pocket
to
smoke
in
the
train
now
then
let
see
that
photograph
once
more
chettle
handed
over
the
watch
and
allerdyke
opening
the
case
delicately
removed
the
print
he
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
carefully
examined
the
thing
back
and
front
while
the
detective
glass
in
hand
cigar
in
lips
and
thumb
in
the
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
watched
him
appreciatively
and
inquisitively
make
aught
new
out
of
it
sir
he
asked
after
a
while
instead
of
answering
allerdyke
laid
the
photograph
down
went
across
to
another
table
and
took
from
it
his
album
he
turned
its
leaves
over
until
he
came
to
a
few
loose
prints
he
picked
them
up
one
after
another
and
examined
them
and
suddenly
he
knew
the
secret
there
was
no
longer
any
problem
any
difficulty
about
that
photograph
he
knew
now
and
with
a
sharp
exclamation
he
flung
the
album
back
to
the
and
turned
to
the
detective
chettle
he
said
you
know
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
can
make
it
well
worth
any
man
while
to
keep
a
secret
until
i
tell
him
he
can
speak
about
it
what
i
should
think
so
allerdyke
responded
chettle
readily
enough
and
if
you
want
me
to
keep
a
secret
i
do
for
the
time
being
answered
allerdyke
he
sat
down
again
and
picked
up
the
photograph
which
had
exercised
his
thoughts
so
intensely
i
found
out
the
truth
concerning
this
he
said
tapping
it
with
his
finger
yes
i
hit
it
listen
now
i
told
you
i
only
made
four
prints
of
this
photo
and
that
i
knew
exactly
where
they
all
were
one
in
my
own
album
there
two
given
by
james
to
friends
in
bradford
one
as
we
more
recently
found
out
given
by
james
to
marlow
that
one
the
marlow
one
we
believed
to
be
this
this
and
is
it
mr
allerdyke
asked
chettle
wonderingly
allerdyke
laughed
a
laugh
of
relief
and
satisfaction
less
than
an
hour
ago
he
replied
in
fact
just
before
you
came
in
marlow
showed
me
the
photo
which
james
gave
her
showed
it
to
me
out
below
there
in
the
hall
no
mistaking
it
and
so
when
you
came
i
was
racking
my
brains
to
rags
trying
to
settle
what
this
photo
this
was
and
now
i
know
what
it
is
and
damn
me
if
i
know
whether
the
discovery
makes
things
plainer
or
more
mixed
up
but
i
know
what
this
is
anyway
and
what
is
it
sir
asked
chettle
eagerly
eyeing
the
photo
as
if
it
were
some
fearful
living
curiosity
what
mr
allerdyke
why
it
a
photograph
of
my
photograph
almost
shouted
allerdyke
with
a
thump
of
his
big
hand
on
the
table
that
the
truth
this
has
been
reproduced
from
mine
d
see
look
here
happen
you
do
know
much
about
photography
but
you
follow
me
i
always
use
a
certain
sort
of
paper
i
stuck
to
one
particular
sort
for
years
all
the
photos
in
that
album
are
done
on
that
particular
sort
the
four
prints
i
made
of
james
last
photo
were
done
on
that
paper
now
then
this
photo
this
print
that
you
found
in
lydenberg
watch
is
not
done
on
that
paper
it
a
totally
different
paper
therefore
this
is
a
reproduction
it
is
not
my
original
print
at
all
it
been
copied
from
it
see
chettle
who
had
followed
all
this
with
concentrated
attention
nodded
his
head
several
times
clever
clever
clever
he
said
with
undisguised
admiration
clever
indeed
that
a
smart
bit
of
work
sir
i
see
i
understand
bless
my
soul
and
what
do
you
gather
from
that
mr
allerdyke
this
answered
allerdyke
just
now
marlow
said
to
me
speaking
of
her
photo
the
fourth
print
you
know
misplaced
it
some
time
ago
she
said
could
lay
hands
on
it
but
i
came
across
it
accidentally
this
morning
now
then
chettle
here
the
thing
somebody
took
that
fourth
print
from
marlow
reproduced
it
and
that
that
print
which
you
found
in
lydenberg
watch
is
the
reproduction
so
that
began
chettle
suggestively
so
that
so
that
the
thing
now
is
to
find
who
it
is
that
made
the
reproduction
said
allerdyke
when
we
found
him
or
her
i
reckon
we
shall
have
found
the
man
who
at
the
heart
of
all
this
leave
that
to
me
keep
this
a
dead
secret
until
i
tell
you
to
speak
we
shall
have
to
tell
all
this
and
a
bonny
sight
more
to
your
bosses
at
headquarters
off
you
go
to
hull
and
do
what
you
have
to
do
and
i
get
on
with
my
work
here
i
said
i
did
know
whether
this
discovery
makes
things
thicker
or
clearer
but
by
george
it
a
step
forward
anyway
chettle
put
the
reproduction
back
into
the
case
of
the
watch
and
bestowed
it
safely
in
his
pocket
one
step
forward
a
good
deal
in
a
case
like
this
allerdyke
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
next
step
now
try
to
find
out
who
made
that
reproduction
replied
allerdyke
bluntly
no
easy
job
either
the
ground
continually
shifting
and
changing
under
one
very
feet
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
my
present
theory
somebody
got
information
of
that
jewel
deal
from
office
somebody
who
had
access
to
his
papers
somebody
who
managed
to
steal
that
photo
of
mine
from
marlow
for
a
few
days
or
until
they
could
reproduce
it
what
i
want
to
find
now
is
an
idea
of
that
somebody
and
i
get
it
i
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
it
but
other
matters
you
say
your
folks
at
the
yard
are
going
to
follow
up
that
perrigo
woman
clue
they
think
it
important
then
in
the
case
of
the
frenchwoman
yes
answered
chettle
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
and
brought
out
a
crumpled
paper
here
a
proof
of
the
bill
they
getting
out
he
said
they
set
to
work
on
that
as
soon
as
they
got
the
information
that
be
up
outside
every
in
a
few
hours
and
it
gone
out
to
the
press
too
allerdyke
took
the
proof
still
damp
from
the
machine
and
looked
it
over
it
asked
in
the
usual
formal
language
for
any
information
about
a
young
man
dark
presumably
a
foreigner
who
about
the
middle
of
march
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
two
pug
dogs
generally
bedecked
with
blue
ribbons
into
kensington
gardens
there
ought
to
be
some
response
to
that
you
know
allerdyke
remarked
chettle
somebody
must
remember
and
know
something
about
that
young
fellow
but
upon
my
soul
as
i
said
to
blindway
just
now
i
know
whether
that
bill
a
mere
advertisement
or
a
death
warrant
death
warrant
exclaimed
allerdyke
what
mean
chettle
chuckled
knowingly
mean
he
said
why
this
if
that
young
fellow
who
led
pugs
about
and
talked
to
mamselle
lisette
in
kensington
gardens
is
another
of
the
paws
that
this
gang
evidently
made
use
of
i
should
say
that
when
the
gang
sees
he
being
searched
for
they
out
him
just
as
they
outed
her
and
lydenberg
that
what
i
mean
allerdyke
they
do
him
in
themselves
before
anybody
else
can
get
at
him
see
allerdyke
saw
and
when
the
detective
had
gone
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
lighted
one
of
his
strongest
cigars
drew
pen
ink
and
paper
to
him
and
began
to
work
at
his
problem
with
a
grim
determination
to
evolve
at
any
rate
a
clear
theory
of
its
possible
solution
chapter
xxiv
concerning
carl
federman
next
morning
as
allerdyke
was
leaving
the
hotel
with
the
intention
of
going
down
to
gresham
street
one
of
the
ran
after
and
hailed
him
you
wanted
at
the
telephone
sir
he
said
call
for
you
just
come
through
allerdyke
went
back
to
find
himself
hailed
by
blindway
would
he
drive
on
to
the
yard
at
once
and
bring
fullaway
with
him
both
were
wanted
particularly
in
connection
with
the
perrigo
information
allerdyke
promised
for
himself
and
went
upstairs
to
find
fullaway
he
met
him
coming
down
and
gave
him
the
message
fullaway
looked
undecided
you
know
what
i
told
you
yesterday
allerdyke
he
said
i
did
want
to
be
bothered
further
with
these
police
chaps
van
koon
and
i
are
on
a
line
of
our
own
and
as
you
like
interrupted
allerdyke
but
all
the
same
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
refuse
a
chance
of
acquiring
information
even
if
you
do
want
to
tell
the
police
anything
that
no
reason
why
you
should
learn
something
from
them
there
that
in
it
certainly
assented
fullaway
all
right
you
get
a
taxi
and
i
join
you
in
a
minute
or
two
as
they
got
out
of
one
cab
at
the
police
headquarters
celia
lennard
appeared
in
another
she
made
a
little
grimace
as
the
two
men
greeted
her
again
she
exclaimed
what
are
we
going
to
be
treated
to
now
more
old
women
with
vague
stories
i
suppose
what
good
is
it
at
all
and
when
am
i
going
to
hear
something
about
my
jewels
you
never
know
what
you
going
to
hear
when
you
visit
these
palatial
halls
answered
fullaway
you
may
be
going
to
have
the
biggest
surprise
of
your
life
you
know
they
sent
for
you
rang
me
up
in
the
middle
of
my
breakfast
answered
celia
well
find
out
what
new
sensation
this
is
some
extraordinary
creature
on
view
again
of
course
the
creature
on
view
proved
to
be
a
little
fat
man
obviously
french
or
swiss
who
sat
his
rotund
figure
tightly
enveloped
in
a
the
lapel
of
which
was
decorated
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
facing
the
chief
desk
he
was
a
nervous
alert
little
man
his
carefully
trimmed
moustache
and
pointed
beard
quivered
with
excitement
his
dark
eyes
blazed
and
at
sight
of
the
elegantly
attired
lady
he
bounced
out
of
his
chair
swept
his
silk
hat
to
the
ground
and
executed
a
deep
bow
of
the
most
extreme
politeness
this
observed
the
chief
with
a
smile
at
his
visitors
is
monsieur
aristide
bonnechose
bonnechose
believes
that
he
can
tell
us
something
it
is
a
supplement
to
what
perrigo
told
us
yesterday
it
relates
of
course
to
the
young
man
whom
perrigo
told
us
of
the
young
man
who
led
pugs
in
kensington
gardens
the
pogs
of
madame
my
spouse
said
bonnechose
with
a
bow
and
a
solemn
expression
two
pogs
fifi
and
bonnechose
continued
the
chief
regarding
his
company
with
yet
another
smile
is
the
proprietor
of
a
what
is
your
establishment
monsieur
monsieur
replied
bonnechose
promptly
and
politely
small
but
elegant
of
my
name
monsieur
the
cafe
bonnechose
oxford
street
established
nine
years
i
succeeded
to
a
former
proprietor
monsieur
jules
on
his
lamented
decease
i
think
bonnechose
had
better
tell
us
his
history
in
his
own
fashion
remarked
the
chief
looking
around
you
are
aware
allerdyke
and
you
too
fullaway
and
so
i
suppose
are
you
miss
lennard
that
after
hearing
what
perrigo
had
to
tell
us
i
put
out
a
bill
asking
for
information
about
the
young
man
perrigo
described
and
the
matter
was
also
mentioned
in
last
night
and
this
papers
bonnechose
read
about
it
in
his
newspaper
and
so
he
came
here
at
once
he
tells
me
that
he
knew
a
young
man
who
was
good
enough
during
the
early
spring
to
occasionally
take
out
madame
bonnechose
prize
dogs
for
an
airing
that
seems
to
have
been
the
same
man
referred
to
by
perrigo
now
bonnechose
give
us
the
details
bonnechose
set
down
his
tall
very
parisian
hat
on
the
edge
of
the
chief
desk
and
proceeded
to
use
his
hands
in
conjunction
with
his
tongue
with
pleasure
monsieur
he
responded
it
is
this
way
then
you
will
comprehend
that
madame
my
spouse
and
myself
are
of
the
busiest
we
do
not
keep
a
great
staff
accordingly
we
have
much
to
do
ourselves
consequently
we
have
not
much
time
to
go
out
to
take
the
air
madame
my
spouse
she
has
a
love
for
the
dogs
she
keeps
two
fifi
and
pogs
what
they
call
pedigree
dogs
valuable
beautiful
animals
but
needing
exercise
it
is
a
trouble
to
madame
that
they
can
not
disport
themselves
more
frequently
now
about
the
beginning
of
this
spring
a
young
man
compatriot
of
my
own
a
swiss
from
the
vaud
canton
he
begins
coming
to
my
cafe
sometimes
he
comes
for
his
lunch
sometimes
he
drops
in
as
they
say
for
a
cup
of
coffee
we
find
out
he
and
i
that
we
come
from
the
same
district
in
the
event
we
become
friendly
this
young
man
name
m
bonnechose
asked
the
chief
what
we
knew
him
by
federman
replied
bonnechose
carl
federman
he
told
me
he
was
looking
out
for
a
job
as
valet
to
a
rich
man
he
had
been
a
waiter
somewhere
in
london
some
hotel
i
think
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
anyway
while
he
was
looking
for
his
job
he
certainly
had
plenty
of
money
plenty
he
do
himself
very
well
with
his
lunches
sometimes
he
come
and
have
his
dinner
at
night
we
are
not
expensive
you
understand
nice
lunch
for
two
shillings
nice
dinner
for
three
nothing
to
him
that
he
always
carry
plenty
of
money
in
his
pockets
well
then
of
course
having
nothing
to
do
often
he
talks
to
me
and
madame
one
day
we
talk
of
the
pogs
then
walking
about
the
establishment
he
remarks
that
they
are
too
fat
madame
sighs
and
says
the
poor
darlings
do
not
get
sufficient
exercise
he
is
this
federman
he
say
at
once
will
exercise
them
i
myself
so
he
come
next
day
like
a
good
friend
madame
puts
blue
ribbons
on
the
pogs
and
bids
them
behave
nicely
away
they
go
with
federman
for
the
excursion
many
days
he
thus
takes
them
to
hyde
park
to
kensington
gardens
out
of
the
neighbourliness
you
understand
madame
is
much
obliged
to
him
she
regards
him
as
a
kind
young
man
eh
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
do
not
see
federman
any
more
no
nor
hear
of
him
until
monsieur
asks
for
news
of
him
in
the
papers
i
see
that
news
last
night
madame
sees
it
we
start
we
look
at
each
other
we
regard
ourselves
with
comprehension
we
both
make
the
same
exclamation
is
federman
he
is
wanted
he
has
done
something
then
madame
says
in
the
morning
you
will
go
to
the
police
commissary
i
say
shall
be
done
we
will
have
no
mystery
around
the
cafe
bonnechose
monsieur
i
am
here
and
i
have
spoken
and
that
is
all
you
know
m
bonnechose
asked
the
chief
all
monsieur
absolutely
all
about
when
was
it
that
this
young
man
first
came
to
your
cafe
then
about
the
beginning
of
march
or
end
of
february
monsieur
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
good
weather
you
understand
and
he
left
off
coming
when
beginning
of
april
monsieur
after
that
we
never
see
him
again
often
we
say
to
ourselves
is
federman
the
pogs
they
look
at
the
seat
which
he
was
accustomed
to
take
as
much
as
to
ask
the
same
question
but
concluded
bonnechose
with
a
dismal
shake
of
his
head
and
a
spreading
forth
of
his
hands
he
never
visit
us
no
more
no
now
listen
bonnechose
said
the
chief
did
this
man
ever
give
you
any
particulars
about
himself
none
but
what
i
have
told
you
monsieur
and
which
i
do
not
now
remember
ever
tell
you
where
he
lived
in
london
the
time
he
was
visiting
you
no
monsieur
never
did
he
ever
come
to
your
place
accompanied
by
anybody
bring
any
friends
there
bonnechose
put
himself
into
an
attitude
of
deep
thought
he
remained
in
it
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
exchanged
it
for
one
of
joyful
recollection
on
one
occasion
a
lady
he
exclaimed
a
frenchwoman
tall
that
is
taller
than
is
usual
amongst
frenchwomen
slender
elegant
dark
dark
black
eyes
not
beautiful
you
understand
but
engaging
lisette
muttered
celia
on
only
one
occasion
you
say
m
bonnechose
asked
the
chief
when
was
it
about
the
time
i
speak
of
monsieur
they
came
in
one
night
rather
late
they
had
a
light
supper
nothing
much
he
did
not
tell
you
who
she
was
not
a
word
monsieur
he
was
as
a
rule
very
secretive
this
federman
saying
little
about
his
own
affairs
you
do
remember
that
he
ever
brought
any
one
else
there
no
men
for
instance
bonnechose
shook
his
head
then
once
again
his
face
brightened
no
he
said
but
once
just
once
i
saw
federman
talking
to
a
man
in
the
street
shaftesbury
avenue
a
man
well
built
brown
hair
a
frenchman
i
think
but
of
course
a
stranger
to
me
the
chief
exchanged
a
glance
with
allerdyke
and
fullaway
both
knew
what
that
glance
meant
bonnechose
description
tallied
remarkably
with
that
of
the
man
who
had
gone
to
eastbourne
terrace
hotel
with
lisette
beaurepaire
a
man
with
brown
hair
and
well
built
eh
said
the
chief
and
when
just
then
an
interruption
came
in
the
person
of
a
man
who
entered
the
room
and
gave
evident
signs
of
a
desire
to
tell
something
to
his
superior
the
chief
left
his
chair
went
across
to
the
door
and
received
a
communication
which
was
evidently
of
considerable
moment
he
turned
and
beckoned
blindway
the
three
went
out
of
the
room
several
minutes
passed
then
the
chief
came
back
alone
and
looked
at
his
visitors
with
a
glance
of
significance
we
have
just
got
news
of
something
that
relates
i
think
to
the
very
subject
we
were
discussing
he
said
a
young
man
has
been
found
dead
in
bed
at
a
city
hotel
this
morning
under
very
suspicious
circumstances
circumstances
very
similar
to
those
of
the
eastbourne
terrace
affair
and
he
went
on
glancing
at
a
scrap
of
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
the
description
of
him
very
closely
resembles
that
of
this
man
federman
of
course
it
not
an
uncommon
type
but
another
of
exclaimed
allerdyke
he
had
suddenly
remembered
what
chettle
had
said
about
the
new
bill
being
a
possible
and
the
words
started
irrepressibly
to
his
lips
good
lord
the
chief
gave
him
a
quick
glance
it
seemed
as
if
he
instinctively
divined
what
was
passing
in
allerdyke
mind
i
sorry
to
trouble
you
he
said
without
referring
to
interruption
but
i
afraid
i
must
ask
you
all
of
you
to
run
down
to
this
city
hotel
with
me
we
must
leave
a
stone
unturned
and
if
any
of
you
can
identify
this
man
oh
you
do
want
me
surely
cried
celia
please
let
me
off
i
do
so
hate
that
sort
of
thing
naturally
remarked
the
chief
but
i
afraid
i
want
you
more
than
any
one
miss
lennard
you
and
bonnechose
come
we
go
at
once
blindway
has
gone
down
to
get
two
cabs
for
us
blindway
bonnechose
and
fullaway
rode
to
the
city
in
one
cab
celia
allerdyke
and
the
chief
in
another
their
journey
came
to
an
end
in
a
quiet
old
street
near
the
docks
and
at
the
door
of
an
looking
hotel
there
was
a
landlord
and
a
detective
or
two
and
sundry
police
to
meet
them
and
inquisitive
eyes
looked
out
of
doors
and
round
corners
as
they
went
upstairs
to
a
door
which
was
guarded
by
two
constables
the
chief
turned
to
celia
with
a
word
of
encouragement
one
look
will
answer
the
purpose
he
said
quietly
but
look
closely
the
next
moment
all
six
were
standing
round
a
narrow
bed
on
which
was
laid
out
the
dead
body
of
a
young
man
the
face
calm
composed
looked
more
like
that
of
a
man
who
lay
quietly
and
peacefully
asleep
than
one
who
had
died
under
suspicious
circumstances
well
asked
the
chief
presently
what
do
you
say
miss
lennard
celia
caught
her
breath
this
this
is
the
man
who
came
to
hull
she
whispered
the
man
you
know
who
called
himself
lisette
brother
i
knew
him
instantly
and
you
m
bonnechose
said
the
chief
do
you
recognize
him
the
who
had
been
making
inarticulate
murmurs
of
surprise
and
grief
nodded
federman
he
said
oh
yes
monsieur
federman
without
doubt
poor
fellow
the
chief
turned
to
leave
the
room
saying
quietly
that
that
was
all
he
wished
but
fullaway
who
had
been
staring
moodily
at
the
dead
man
suddenly
stopped
him
look
here
he
said
i
know
this
man
too
but
not
as
federman
i
not
mistaken
about
him
and
i
do
think
miss
lennard
or
bonnechose
are
either
but
i
knew
him
as
fritz
ebers
he
acted
as
my
valet
at
the
waldorf
from
the
beginning
of
april
to
about
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
may
last
and
since
we
now
know
what
we
do
it
my
opinion
that
there
there
in
that
dead
man
is
the
last
of
the
puppets
the
frenchwoman
lydenberg
now
this
fellow
all
three
got
rid
of
now
then
where
the
man
who
pulled
the
strings
where
the
chapter
xxv
the
card
on
the
door
the
chief
made
no
immediate
reply
to
fullaway
somewhat
excited
outburst
he
led
his
little
party
from
the
room
and
in
the
corridor
turned
to
celia
and
the
café
keeper
that
all
miss
lennard
thank
you
he
said
sorry
to
have
to
ask
you
to
take
part
in
these
painful
affairs
but
it
ca
be
helped
bonnechose
i
obliged
to
you
you
hear
from
me
again
very
soon
in
the
meantime
keep
counsel
do
talk
to
anybody
except
madame
no
gossiping
with
customers
you
know
allerdyke
will
you
see
miss
lennard
downstairs
and
into
a
cab
and
then
join
fullaway
and
me
again
we
must
have
a
talk
with
the
police
and
the
hotel
people
when
allerdyke
went
back
into
the
hotel
he
found
blindway
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
of
a
room
in
which
the
chief
fullaway
a
city
and
a
detective
were
already
closeted
with
the
landlord
and
landlady
the
landlord
a
somewhat
sullen
individual
who
appeared
to
be
greatly
vexed
and
disconcerted
by
these
events
was
already
being
questioned
by
the
chief
as
to
what
he
knew
of
the
young
man
whose
body
they
had
just
seen
and
he
was
replying
somewhat
testily
i
know
no
more
about
him
than
i
know
of
any
chance
customer
he
was
saying
when
allerdyke
was
ushered
in
by
blindway
who
immediately
closed
the
door
on
this
informal
conclave
you
see
what
this
house
is
a
house
for
gentlemen
having
business
in
this
part
round
about
the
docks
we
get
a
lot
of
commercial
gentlemen
men
lots
of
our
customers
are
people
who
are
going
to
foreign
places
antwerp
rotterdam
hamburg
and
so
on
they
put
up
here
just
for
the
night
before
sailing
i
took
this
young
man
for
one
of
that
sort
in
fact
i
think
he
made
some
inquiry
about
one
of
the
boats
he
did
affirmed
the
landlady
he
asked
william
the
what
time
the
rotterdam
steamer
sailed
this
morning
and
that
about
all
we
know
continued
the
landlord
i
never
took
any
particular
notice
of
him
and
just
answer
a
few
questions
said
the
chief
interrupting
him
quietly
we
shall
get
at
what
we
want
to
know
more
easily
that
way
what
time
did
this
young
man
come
to
the
hotel
yesterday
the
landlord
turned
to
his
wife
with
an
expressive
gesture
ask
her
he
answered
she
looks
after
all
that
i
not
so
much
in
the
office
he
came
at
seven
last
night
said
the
landlady
i
was
in
the
office
and
i
booked
him
and
gave
him
his
room
was
he
alone
quite
alone
he
the
that
upstairs
in
the
room
now
and
an
overcoat
and
an
umbrella
of
course
said
the
chief
he
gave
you
some
name
some
address
he
gave
the
name
and
address
of
frank
herman
walthamstow
replied
the
landlady
opening
a
ledger
which
she
had
brought
into
the
room
there
you
are
that
his
writing
the
chief
drew
the
book
to
him
glanced
at
the
entry
and
closed
the
book
again
keeping
a
finger
in
it
well
what
was
seen
of
him
during
the
evening
he
asked
nothing
much
replied
the
landlady
he
had
his
supper
in
the
a
couple
of
chops
and
coffee
he
was
reading
the
papers
in
the
until
about
ten
i
saw
him
myself
going
upstairs
between
that
and
eleven
as
i
did
see
him
about
next
morning
and
as
his
breakfast
was
booked
i
asked
where
he
was
and
the
chambermaid
said
there
was
a
card
on
his
door
saying
that
he
was
to
be
called
till
eleven
where
is
that
card
asked
the
chief
it
here
in
this
envelope
answered
the
landlady
who
seemed
to
be
much
more
alert
and
much
sharper
of
intellect
than
her
husband
i
took
care
of
it
when
we
found
out
what
had
happened
i
suppose
you
take
charge
of
it
if
you
please
answered
the
chief
he
took
the
envelope
looked
inside
it
to
make
sure
that
the
card
was
there
and
turned
to
the
landlady
again
yes
he
said
when
you
found
out
what
had
happened
now
who
did
find
out
what
had
happened
well
answered
the
landlady
the
chambermaid
came
down
soon
after
eleven
and
said
she
could
get
to
answer
her
knock
of
course
i
understood
that
he
wanted
to
catch
the
rotterdam
boat
which
sailed
about
noon
so
i
sent
my
husband
up
and
as
he
could
get
any
answer
i
went
in
with
the
chambermaid
key
broke
in
the
landlord
and
there
he
was
just
as
you
seen
him
dead
and
if
you
ask
me
he
was
cold
too
been
dead
some
time
in
my
opinion
the
surgeon
said
several
hours
six
or
seven
remarked
the
inspector
in
an
aside
to
the
chief
thought
he
been
dead
since
four
no
signs
of
anything
in
the
room
i
suppose
asked
the
chief
nothing
disturbed
eh
nothing
replied
the
landlord
stolidly
the
room
was
as
you
expect
to
find
it
tidy
enough
and
nothing
touched
as
the
police
that
were
called
in
at
first
can
testify
they
can
swear
as
his
money
was
all
right
and
his
watch
and
chain
all
right
there
been
no
robbery
and
he
added
with
resentful
emphasis
i
do
care
what
you
nor
nobody
says
no
case
of
murder
this
it
suicide
that
what
it
is
i
do
want
my
house
to
get
the
name
and
character
of
a
murder
place
i
ca
help
it
if
a
apparently
respectable
young
fellow
comes
and
suicides
himself
in
my
house
there
nobody
can
avoid
that
as
i
know
of
but
when
it
comes
to
murder
no
one
has
said
anything
about
murder
so
far
interrupted
the
chief
quietly
but
since
you
suggest
it
perhaps
we
better
ask
who
you
got
in
the
house
last
night
he
opened
the
register
at
the
page
in
which
he
had
kept
his
finger
and
looked
at
the
last
entries
i
see
that
three
no
four
people
came
in
after
this
young
man
who
called
himself
frank
herman
you
booked
them
i
suppose
he
went
on
turning
to
the
landlady
were
they
known
to
you
only
one
that
one
peter
donaldson
dundee
answered
the
landlady
he
the
representative
of
a
jute
firm
he
often
comes
here
he
in
the
house
now
or
he
was
an
hour
ago
he
be
here
for
two
or
three
days
those
two
and
nielsen
they
appeared
to
be
foreigners
they
were
here
for
the
night
had
breakfast
early
and
went
away
by
some
boat
our
porter
carried
their
things
to
it
quiet
elderly
folks
they
were
and
the
fourth
john
barcombe
manchester
you
did
know
him
asked
the
chief
pointing
to
the
last
entry
i
see
you
gave
him
number
two
doors
from
herman
yes
said
the
landlady
no
i
did
know
him
he
came
in
about
nine
and
had
some
supper
before
he
went
up
he
his
breakfast
at
eight
this
morning
and
went
away
at
once
lots
of
our
customers
do
that
they
just
in
for
bed
and
breakfast
and
we
scarcely
notice
them
did
you
notice
this
man
barcombe
asked
the
chief
well
not
particularly
but
i
a
fair
recollection
of
him
a
rather
pale
man
lightish
brown
hair
and
moustache
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
he
no
luggage
and
he
paid
me
for
supper
bed
and
breakfast
when
he
booked
his
room
replied
the
landlady
quite
a
quiet
respectable
man
he
said
something
about
being
unexpectedly
obliged
to
stop
for
the
night
but
i
did
pay
any
great
attention
the
chief
looked
attentively
at
the
open
page
of
the
register
then
he
drew
the
attention
of
those
around
him
to
the
signature
of
john
barcombe
it
was
a
big
sprawling
signature
all
the
letters
sloping
downward
from
left
to
right
and
being
of
an
unusual
size
for
a
man
that
looks
to
me
like
a
feigned
handwriting
he
said
however
note
this
you
see
that
entry
of
frank
herman
observe
his
handwriting
now
compare
it
with
the
writing
on
the
card
which
was
fixed
on
the
door
of
herman
room
look
he
drew
the
card
out
of
its
envelope
as
he
spoke
and
laid
it
beside
the
entry
in
the
register
and
marshall
allerdyke
bending
over
his
shoulder
to
look
almost
cried
out
with
astonishment
for
the
writing
on
the
card
was
certainly
the
same
as
that
which
chettle
had
shown
him
on
the
found
on
lydenberg
and
on
the
back
of
the
photograph
of
james
allerdyke
discovered
in
lydenberg
watch
it
was
only
by
a
big
effort
that
he
checked
the
exclamation
which
was
springing
to
his
lips
and
stopped
himself
from
snatching
up
the
card
from
the
table
you
observe
said
the
chief
quietly
you
ca
fail
to
observe
that
the
writing
in
the
register
is
not
the
writing
of
the
card
pinned
on
the
door
of
number
they
are
quite
different
the
writing
of
frank
herman
in
the
register
is
in
thick
stunted
strokes
the
writing
on
the
card
is
in
thin
angular
what
are
commonly
called
crabbed
strokes
yet
it
is
supposed
that
herman
put
that
card
outside
his
bedroom
door
how
is
it
then
that
herman
handwriting
was
thick
and
stunted
when
he
registered
at
seven
and
slender
and
a
bit
shaky
when
he
wrote
this
card
at
say
ten
or
eleven
of
course
herman
or
whatever
his
real
name
is
never
wrote
the
line
on
that
card
and
never
pinned
that
card
on
his
door
the
landlord
opened
his
heavy
lips
and
gasped
the
landlady
sighed
with
a
gradually
awakening
interest
amidst
a
dead
silence
the
chief
went
on
with
his
critical
inspection
of
the
handwriting
but
now
look
at
the
signature
of
the
man
who
called
himself
john
barcombe
of
manchester
you
will
observe
that
he
signed
that
name
in
a
great
sprawling
hand
across
the
page
and
that
the
letters
slope
from
left
to
right
downward
instead
of
in
the
usually
accepted
fashion
of
left
to
right
upward
now
at
first
sight
there
is
no
great
similarity
in
the
writing
of
that
entry
in
the
register
and
that
on
the
card
one
is
rounded
and
sprawling
and
the
other
is
thin
and
precise
but
there
is
one
remarkable
and
striking
similarity
in
the
entry
in
the
register
there
are
two
a
the
a
in
barcombe
the
a
in
manchester
on
the
one
line
on
the
card
found
pinned
to
the
door
there
are
also
two
a
the
a
in
please
the
a
in
call
now
observe
whether
the
writing
is
big
sprawling
thin
precise
feigned
obviously
in
one
case
natural
i
think
in
the
other
all
those
four
a
are
the
same
this
man
has
grown
so
accustomed
to
making
his
a
after
the
greek
fashion
a
done
in
one
turn
of
the
pen
that
he
has
made
them
even
in
his
feigned
handwriting
there
not
a
doubt
to
my
mind
that
the
card
found
on
herman
door
was
written
and
put
on
that
door
by
the
man
who
registered
as
john
barcombe
and
he
added
in
an
undertone
to
allerdyke
i
no
doubt
either
that
he
the
man
of
the
eastbourne
terrace
affair
the
landlord
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
scowling
gloomily
at
everybody
then
you
are
making
it
out
to
be
murder
he
exclaimed
sulkily
just
what
i
expected
never
had
police
called
in
yet
without
making
mountains
out
of
molehills
murder
indeed
nothing
but
a
case
of
suicide
that
what
i
say
and
as
this
is
a
temperance
hotel
and
not
a
licensed
house
i
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
have
that
body
taken
away
to
the
mortuary
i
shall
be
having
the
character
of
my
place
taken
away
next
and
then
where
shall
i
be
i
should
like
to
know
he
swung
indignantly
out
of
the
room
and
his
wife
murmuring
that
it
was
certainly
very
hard
on
innocent
people
that
these
things
went
on
followed
him
the
police
giving
no
heed
to
these
protests
proceeded
to
examine
the
articles
taken
from
the
dead
man
clothing
whatever
had
been
the
object
of
the
murderer
it
was
certainly
not
robbery
there
was
a
purse
and
a
containing
a
considerable
amount
of
money
in
gold
and
notes
a
good
watch
and
chain
and
a
ring
or
two
of
some
value
just
the
same
circumstances
as
in
the
eastbourne
terrace
affair
said
the
chief
as
he
rose
well
the
thing
is
to
find
that
man
you
no
doubt
whatever
fullaway
that
this
dead
man
upstairs
is
the
man
you
knew
as
ebers
a
valet
at
your
hotel
none
answered
fullaway
emphatically
none
whatever
lots
of
people
will
be
able
to
identify
him
that
good
at
any
rate
remarked
the
chief
it
a
long
step
towards
something
well
i
must
go
allerdyke
was
in
more
than
half
a
mind
to
draw
the
chief
aside
and
tell
him
about
chettle
discoveries
as
regards
the
handwriting
but
while
he
hesitated
fullaway
tugged
earnestly
at
his
sleeve
come
away
whispered
fullaway
come
we
going
to
cut
in
at
this
ourselves
chapter
xxvi
participants
in
the
secret
allerdyke
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
feverish
energy
with
which
fullaway
dragged
him
out
of
the
hotel
forced
him
into
the
first
they
met
and
bade
the
driver
make
haste
to
the
waldorf
he
knew
by
that
time
that
the
american
was
a
nervous
excitable
individual
who
now
and
then
took
on
tremendous
fits
of
work
in
which
he
hustled
and
bustled
everybody
around
him
but
he
had
never
seen
him
quite
so
excited
and
eager
as
now
the
discovery
at
that
shabby
hotel
which
they
had
just
quitted
seemed
to
have
acted
on
him
like
the
smell
of
powder
on
an
old
he
appeared
to
be
positively
panting
for
action
allerdyke
he
almost
shouted
as
the
cab
moved
away
and
he
himself
smote
one
clenched
fist
upon
the
other
allerdyke
this
thing
has
got
to
go
through
i
resign
all
claim
to
that
reward
allerdyke
this
affair
is
too
serious
for
any
work
i
shall
tell
van
koon
that
what
we
know
or
fancy
must
be
thrown
into
the
common
stock
of
knowledge
the
thing
is
to
get
at
the
people
who
been
behind
this
poor
chap
ebers
or
federman
or
herman
or
whatever
his
name
is
allerdyke
we
must
go
right
into
things
allerdyke
laughed
sardonically
when
fullaway
developed
excitement
he
developed
coolness
and
his
voice
became
as
dry
and
hard
as
the
was
fervid
and
eloquent
aye
he
said
in
his
most
phlegmatic
tones
aye
just
so
and
where
d
intend
to
cut
in
now
like
is
it
a
sort
of
gordian
knot
affair
that
you
thinking
of
going
to
solve
this
difficulty
at
one
blow
do
be
sarcastic
retorted
fullaway
i
going
to
take
things
clean
up
from
this
federman
or
ebers
affair
i
going
deep
deep
you
see
in
a
few
minutes
willing
to
see
and
to
hear
aught
remarked
allerdyke
laconically
i
been
doing
naught
else
since
i
got
that
wireless
telegram
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
until
the
waldorf
was
reached
there
fullaway
raced
his
companion
upstairs
to
his
rooms
and
burst
in
upon
marlow
like
a
whirlwind
the
pretty
secretary
busied
with
her
typewriter
looked
up
glanced
at
both
men
and
calmly
resumed
her
labours
mrs
marlow
exclaimed
fullaway
just
step
to
van
koon
rooms
and
beg
him
to
come
back
here
to
my
with
you
important
business
marlow
i
want
you
too
allerdyke
closely
watching
the
woman
around
whom
so
much
mystery
centred
saw
that
she
did
not
move
so
much
as
an
eyelash
she
laid
her
work
aside
left
the
room
and
within
a
minute
returned
with
van
koon
who
gazed
at
fullaway
with
an
air
of
inquiry
something
happened
he
asked
nodding
to
allerdyke
town
on
fire
van
koon
sit
down
commanded
fullaway
pushing
his
compatriot
into
the
inner
room
marlow
fasten
that
outer
door
and
come
in
here
going
to
have
a
stiff
conference
sit
down
please
all
of
you
now
he
went
on
when
the
other
three
had
ranged
themselves
about
the
centre
table
there
is
news
van
koon
allerdyke
and
i
have
just
come
away
from
an
hotel
in
the
docks
where
we
seen
the
dead
body
of
a
young
man
been
found
dead
there
under
precisely
similar
circumstances
to
those
which
attended
the
death
of
the
french
maid
in
eastbourne
terrace
also
heard
a
description
of
a
man
who
was
at
this
hotel
in
the
docks
last
night
it
corresponds
to
that
of
the
fellow
who
accompanied
lisette
beaurepaire
i
personally
have
no
doubt
that
this
man
whoever
he
is
is
the
murderer
of
lisette
and
of
this
youngster
whose
body
we
just
seen
marlow
this
dead
young
fellow
from
whose
just
come
is
that
valet
i
used
to
have
here
ebers
you
remember
him
sure
answered
marlow
quite
calmly
and
unconcernedly
very
well
indeed
this
ebers
continued
fullaway
turning
to
van
koon
was
a
young
fellow
swiss
german
something
of
that
sort
who
acted
as
valet
to
me
and
to
some
other
men
here
in
this
hotel
for
a
time
i
need
go
into
too
many
details
now
but
there
no
doubt
that
he
knew
and
was
in
touch
with
lisette
beaurepaire
and
miss
lennard
positively
identifies
him
as
the
man
who
met
her
and
lisette
at
hull
and
represented
himself
as
lisette
brother
now
then
ebers
we
stick
to
that
name
for
the
sake
of
clearness
was
in
and
out
of
my
rooms
a
good
deal
of
course
and
what
i
want
to
know
now
marlow
is
do
you
think
he
got
access
to
our
letters
papers
books
could
he
find
out
for
instance
that
i
was
engaged
in
this
deal
between
the
princess
nastirsevitch
and
delkin
and
that
miss
lennard
had
bought
the
pinkie
pell
pearls
think
marlow
had
evidently
done
her
thinking
she
replied
without
hesitation
if
he
did
or
could
it
would
be
through
your
own
carelessness
fullaway
she
said
you
know
that
i
am
ridiculously
careful
about
that
sort
of
thing
from
the
time
i
come
here
in
the
morning
until
i
leave
at
five
no
one
has
any
chance
of
seeing
our
papers
or
our
letter
book
or
our
book
they
are
always
on
my
desk
while
i
am
in
the
office
and
when
i
go
downstairs
to
lunch
i
lock
them
up
in
the
safe
but
you
not
careful
how
many
times
have
i
come
in
the
morning
and
found
that
you
taken
these
things
out
of
the
safe
and
left
them
lying
about
for
anybody
to
see
dozens
of
times
i
know
i
know
admitted
fullaway
with
a
groan
i
frightfully
careless
always
was
i
quite
admit
it
marlow
quite
of
course
continued
marlow
in
precise
even
tones
of
course
if
you
left
the
lying
round
and
the
book
in
which
the
duplicates
of
all
our
telegrams
and
cablegrams
are
kept
too
why
this
ebers
man
could
easily
read
what
he
liked
for
himself
when
he
was
in
here
of
a
morning
before
you
got
up
he
was
in
and
out
a
great
deal
certain
and
as
regards
those
two
affairs
the
documents
we
have
about
them
are
pretty
plain
fullaway
anybody
of
average
intelligence
could
find
out
in
ten
minutes
from
our
and
that
we
negotiated
the
sale
of
the
pinkie
pell
pearls
to
miss
lennard
and
that
james
allerdyke
was
bringing
here
a
valuable
parcel
of
jewels
from
russia
and
concluded
marlow
quietly
from
what
i
saw
of
him
ebers
was
a
smart
man
van
koon
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
all
this
turned
a
glance
on
fullaway
who
sat
in
a
contrite
attitude
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
polished
table
i
guess
you
a
very
careless
individual
my
friend
he
said
shaking
his
head
if
you
will
leave
your
important
papers
lying
about
as
this
lady
says
you
in
the
habit
of
doing
what
do
you
expect
now
been
wondering
who
got
wind
of
this
jewel
deal
and
here
the
very
proof
that
you
gave
every
chance
to
this
ebers
to
acquaint
himself
with
it
and
what
i
like
to
know
now
fullaway
is
this
what
use
do
you
suppose
this
young
fellow
made
of
the
information
he
acquired
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
point
yes
exclaimed
allerdyke
suddenly
that
is
the
point
fullaway
smote
the
table
the
thing
obvious
he
cried
he
sold
his
information
to
a
gang
there
must
have
been
i
mean
must
be
a
gang
it
utterly
impossible
that
all
this
could
have
been
worked
by
one
man
the
man
we
heard
of
in
connection
with
the
deaths
of
lisette
beaurepaire
and
of
ebers
himself
is
only
one
of
the
combination
i
as
sure
of
that
as
i
am
that
i
see
you
but
who
are
they
nobody
answered
this
question
allerdyke
plunged
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stared
at
fullaway
marlow
began
to
trace
imaginary
patterns
on
the
surface
of
the
table
van
koon
produced
a
penknife
and
began
to
scrape
the
edges
of
his
filbert
nails
with
a
preoccupied
air
there
the
thing
i
insisted
on
all
along
fullaway
you
know
he
said
at
last
finding
that
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
speak
insisted
on
it
but
you
always
put
it
off
i
do
care
what
you
say
it
have
to
come
to
it
let
me
suggest
it
now
to
our
friends
here
they
both
cute
enough
i
reckon
oh
as
you
please
as
you
please
replied
fullaway
with
a
wave
of
his
hands
say
anything
you
like
van
koon
it
seems
as
if
too
much
be
said
at
this
juncture
all
right
answered
van
koon
he
turned
to
allerdyke
and
marlow
ever
since
this
affair
was
brought
under
my
notice
he
said
pointed
out
to
fullaway
certain
features
in
connection
with
it
first
there
no
evidence
whatever
that
this
plot
originated
in
or
was
worked
from
russia
second
there
is
evidence
that
it
began
here
in
london
and
was
carried
out
from
london
and
following
on
that
second
proposition
comes
another
fullaway
knew
that
these
jewels
were
coming
he
paused
and
gave
the
secretary
a
keen
look
and
allerdyke
watching
her
just
as
keenly
saw
her
face
and
eyes
as
calm
and
inscrutable
as
ever
it
was
absolutely
evident
that
nothing
could
move
this
woman
no
chance
word
or
allusion
take
her
unawares
van
koon
smiled
and
leaned
nearer
but
he
said
tapping
the
table
in
emphasis
of
his
words
there
was
somebody
else
who
knew
of
this
deal
somebody
whose
name
fullaway
there
steadfastly
refuses
to
bring
in
delkin
fullaway
suddenly
laughed
throwing
up
his
arms
delkin
he
exclaimed
satirically
a
millionaire
several
times
over
the
thing
ridiculous
van
koon
delkin
would
kick
me
out
if
i
went
and
asked
him
delkin
will
have
to
be
asked
interrupted
van
koon
you
will
not
face
the
facts
fullaway
millionaire
multimillionaire
delkin
was
the
third
person
i
leaving
this
valet
ebers
clean
out
though
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
he
was
one
of
the
pieces
of
the
machine
who
knew
that
james
allerdyke
was
bringing
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewels
for
his
delkin
approval
that
a
fact
fullaway
which
can
not
be
got
over
psha
exclaimed
fullaway
i
suppose
you
think
delkin
who
could
buy
up
the
best
jeweller
shop
in
london
or
paris
and
throw
its
contents
to
the
street
children
to
play
with
what
is
it
that
in
your
mind
van
koon
asked
allerdyke
interrupting
fullaway
eloquence
you
some
theory
well
i
do
know
about
theory
answered
van
koon
but
i
guess
got
some
natural
common
sense
if
fullaway
there
thinks
i
suggesting
that
delkin
organized
a
grand
conspiracy
to
rob
james
allerdyke
fullaway
wrong
i
not
what
i
am
suggesting
and
have
been
suggesting
this
last
three
days
is
that
delkin
should
be
asked
a
plain
and
simple
question
which
is
this
did
he
ever
tell
anybody
of
this
proposed
deal
if
so
whom
did
he
tell
and
if
that
is
business
concluded
van
koon
then
i
do
know
business
when
i
see
it
what
your
objection
asked
allerdyke
looking
across
at
fullaway
what
objection
can
you
have
fullaway
shook
his
head
oh
i
do
know
he
said
except
that
it
seems
immaterial
and
that
i
do
want
to
bother
delkin
i
hoping
that
these
jewels
will
be
found
and
that
i
be
able
to
complete
the
transaction
and
besides
i
believe
for
one
instant
that
delkin
would
tell
anybody
i
only
had
two
interviews
with
delkin
one
at
his
hotel
one
here
he
understood
the
affair
was
an
entirely
private
and
secret
transaction
marlow
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
spoke
quickly
you
forgetting
something
fullaway
she
said
you
had
a
letter
from
delkin
confirming
the
provisional
agreement
which
was
that
he
should
have
the
first
option
of
buying
the
princess
jewels
then
being
brought
by
james
allerdyke
from
russia
true
true
exclaimed
fullaway
clapping
a
hand
to
his
forehead
so
i
had
i
forgotten
that
but
after
all
it
was
purely
a
private
letter
from
delkin
and
no
interrupted
marlow
it
was
written
and
signed
by
secretary
so
that
the
secretary
knew
of
the
transaction
van
koon
shook
his
head
and
glanced
at
allerdyke
there
you
are
he
said
the
secretary
knew
delkin
secretary
how
do
we
know
that
delkin
secretary
oh
that
all
rot
van
koon
exclaimed
fullaway
testily
delkin
secretary
merrifield
has
been
with
him
for
years
to
my
knowledge
and
but
allerdyke
had
suddenly
risen
and
was
picking
up
his
hat
from
a
side
table
he
turned
to
fullaway
as
he
put
it
on
i
quite
agree
with
van
koon
he
said
and
as
i
james
allerdyke
cousin
and
his
executor
i
going
to
step
round
and
see
this
delkin
at
his
hotel
the
cecil
you
said
it
no
use
trifling
fullaway
delkin
knew
and
marlow
now
tells
us
his
secretary
knew
all
right
my
job
is
to
see
in
person
anybody
who
knew
then
maybe
i
myself
shall
get
to
know
van
koon
too
rose
i
know
delkin
slightly
he
said
i
go
with
you
at
that
fullaway
jumped
up
evidently
annoyed
and
unwilling
but
prepared
to
act
against
his
own
wishes
oh
all
right
all
right
he
exclaimed
in
that
case
we
all
go
come
on
it
only
across
the
strand
back
after
lunch
marlow
if
anybody
wants
me
the
three
men
marched
out
and
left
the
pretty
secretary
standing
by
the
table
from
which
they
had
all
risen
she
stood
there
for
a
few
minutes
in
deep
thought
stood
until
a
single
stroke
from
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
roused
her
at
that
she
walked
into
the
outer
office
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
and
leaving
the
hotel
went
sharply
off
in
the
direction
of
arundel
street
chapter
xxvii
the
millionaire
the
stranger
and
the
princess
as
the
three
men
threaded
their
way
through
the
crowded
strand
and
approached
the
hotel
cecil
fullaway
suddenly
drew
their
attention
to
a
private
automobile
which
was
turning
in
at
the
entrance
to
the
courtyard
there
delkin
in
his
car
he
exclaimed
and
great
scott
our
princess
with
him
nastirsevitch
but
who
the
other
man
looks
like
a
compatriot
of
ours
van
koon
eh
van
koon
who
had
been
staring
about
him
as
they
crossed
over
from
the
corner
of
wellington
street
turned
and
glanced
at
the
occupants
of
the
car
allerdyke
was
looking
there
too
he
had
never
seen
delkin
as
yet
and
he
was
curious
to
set
eyes
on
a
man
who
had
made
several
millions
out
of
canning
meat
he
had
no
very
clear
conception
of
american
millionaires
and
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
expected
to
see
but
there
were
two
men
in
the
car
with
the
princess
nastirsevitch
and
they
were
both
one
man
was
a
tall
handsome
fellow
dressed
in
grey
tweeds
and
wearing
a
homburg
hat
of
light
grey
with
a
darker
band
his
upturned
grizzled
moustache
gave
him
a
smart
rather
aggressive
appearance
the
monocle
in
his
eye
added
to
his
general
impressiveness
the
other
man
was
not
particularly
impressive
a
medium
sized
rather
plump
little
man
with
a
bland
smiling
countenance
and
mild
eyes
beaming
through
spectacles
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
driver
and
was
just
then
leaning
forward
to
tell
something
to
the
princess
and
the
man
in
the
homburg
hat
who
were
bending
towards
him
and
smiling
at
what
he
said
which
of
is
delkin
then
asked
allerdyke
as
the
automobile
swept
into
the
courtyard
big
or
little
the
little
fellow
with
the
spectacles
replied
fullaway
quiet
unobtrusive
man
delkin
but
cute
as
they
made
know
the
other
man
van
koon
van
koon
had
twisted
round
and
was
staring
back
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
he
shook
his
head
a
little
not
from
adam
he
answered
but
there
a
man
bostonian
just
gone
along
there
that
i
do
know
and
want
to
see
badly
wait
a
bit
for
me
in
the
courtyard
there
fullaway
sha
be
long
he
turned
as
he
spoke
and
darted
off
through
the
crowd
unusually
dense
at
that
moment
because
of
the
luncheon
hour
fullaway
making
no
comment
walked
forward
into
the
courtyard
and
looked
about
him
suddenly
he
nodded
his
head
towards
a
far
corner
there
delkin
and
the
princess
and
the
man
who
was
with
them
sitting
at
a
table
over
there
he
said
i
did
know
that
delkin
and
the
princess
were
acquainted
but
then
of
course
they
both
staying
in
this
hotel
and
they
both
american
well
shall
we
go
to
them
now
allerdyke
or
shall
we
sit
down
here
and
wait
a
bit
for
van
koon
we
wait
replied
allerdyke
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
drew
out
his
have
a
drink
while
we
waiting
he
suggested
beckoning
a
waiter
who
was
passing
what
it
to
be
oh
something
small
then
said
fullaway
dry
sherry
better
bring
three
van
koon
wo
be
long
but
the
minutes
passed
and
van
koon
was
still
absent
ten
minutes
more
went
and
still
he
did
not
come
and
fullaway
pulled
out
his
watch
with
an
air
of
annoyance
too
bad
of
van
koon
he
said
time
going
and
i
know
delkin
lunches
at
two
come
on
allerdyke
he
continued
rising
we
go
over
to
delkin
if
van
koon
comes
he
find
us
he
probably
gone
off
with
that
other
man
though
he
an
chap
in
some
things
and
too
much
given
to
the
affair
of
the
moment
come
on
i
introduce
you
the
chicago
millionaire
once
put
in
possession
of
allerdyke
name
looked
at
him
with
manifest
curiosity
and
motioned
him
and
fullaway
to
take
seats
with
himself
and
his
two
companions
we
were
just
talking
of
your
case
allerdyke
he
said
quietly
the
princess
of
course
has
told
me
about
you
fullaway
i
do
know
if
you
know
this
gentleman
his
name
well
enough
known
anyway
this
gentleman
is
chilverton
the
famous
new
york
detective
chilverton
fullaway
mr
allerdyke
fullaway
and
allerdyke
both
looked
at
the
man
in
the
homburg
hat
with
great
interest
as
they
shook
hands
with
him
fullaway
at
any
rate
knew
of
his
reputation
allerdyke
faintly
remembered
that
he
had
heard
of
him
in
connection
with
some
great
criminal
affair
been
telling
chilverton
about
our
business
mr
delkin
asked
fullaway
pleasantly
asking
his
expert
advice
i
told
him
no
more
than
what
he
could
read
for
himself
in
the
newspapers
answered
delkin
he
got
stuff
of
his
own
to
attend
to
here
in
london
about
our
affair
now
as
you
call
it
fullaway
it
not
my
affair
or
i
guess
i
have
been
more
into
it
by
this
time
the
princess
here
thinks
things
are
going
real
slow
and
so
do
i
what
do
you
think
mr
allerdyke
it
a
case
in
which
things
go
slow
of
sheer
necessity
replied
allerdyke
it
a
case
of
widespread
ramifications
to
use
a
long
word
but
we
keep
having
developments
delkin
there
been
one
this
morning
we
came
to
see
you
about
it
and
perhaps
you
let
fullaway
tell
he
put
things
into
fewer
words
than
i
should
sure
answered
the
millionaire
go
ahead
fullaway
we
all
interested
fullaway
briefly
told
the
story
of
the
discovery
at
the
hotel
in
the
docks
that
morning
and
explained
the
deductions
which
had
been
made
from
it
he
detailed
the
connection
of
ebers
alias
federman
or
herman
with
himself
and
reported
the
conversation
which
had
just
taken
place
at
his
own
rooms
and
then
he
turned
to
allerdyke
with
an
expressive
gesture
i
let
allerdyke
say
why
we
came
here
he
said
it
was
his
idea
and
van
koon
not
mine
your
turn
allerdyke
i
sha
be
slow
to
take
it
responded
allerdyke
stirring
himself
i
one
business
man
delkin
another
i
only
want
to
ask
you
delkin
if
you
ever
talked
of
this
jewel
transaction
to
anybody
beyond
your
own
secretary
it
a
plain
question
and
you
understand
why
i
ask
it
of
course
replied
delkin
genially
quite
right
to
ask
i
can
answer
it
in
one
word
no
as
to
telling
my
secretary
merrifield
who
been
with
me
twelve
years
and
is
a
thoroughly
trustworthy
man
i
merely
told
him
sufficient
for
him
to
write
and
send
that
formal
letter
he
knew
and
knows
at
least
not
from
me
no
details
no
sir
never
a
word
from
me
got
about
not
even
to
my
own
daughter
of
course
the
princess
here
and
myself
have
discussed
matters
since
she
came
and
now
that
you
here
fullaway
i
tell
you
what
i
think
straight
out
i
think
this
affair
has
all
been
planned
from
your
own
office
fullaway
flushed
and
sat
up
in
an
attitude
of
sudden
indignation
oh
come
mr
delkin
he
exclaimed
i
go
softly
young
man
said
delkin
i
mean
no
harm
to
you
and
no
reflections
on
you
but
you
know
i
been
in
your
office
a
few
times
and
i
have
eyes
in
my
head
what
do
you
know
about
that
fascinating
young
woman
you
have
there
i
a
pretty
good
judge
of
human
nature
and
character
and
i
should
say
that
young
lady
is
as
clever
and
deep
as
they
make
who
is
she
there
one
thing
sure
from
what
you
just
told
us
fullaway
you
let
her
know
all
your
business
secrets
fullaway
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
chagrin
and
vexation
i
had
marlow
in
my
employ
for
three
years
he
answered
she
came
to
me
with
excellent
testimonials
and
references
i
just
as
much
reason
to
trust
her
as
you
have
to
trust
merrifield
if
been
untrustworthy
she
could
have
robbed
or
defrauded
me
many
a
time
over
she
did
she
ever
have
the
chance
of
getting
hold
of
a
quarter
of
a
worth
of
jewels
before
asked
delkin
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
allerdyke
come
now
even
the
most
trusted
people
fall
before
a
very
big
temptation
all
business
folk
know
that
what
allerdyke
think
allerdyke
was
not
going
to
say
what
he
thought
he
was
wondering
if
fullaway
knew
what
he
knew
that
marlow
was
also
miss
slade
that
she
had
some
relations
with
a
man
who
also
bore
two
different
names
that
her
actions
were
somewhat
suspicious
but
that
was
not
the
time
to
say
all
this
he
said
something
instead
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
knowledge
that
my
cousin
was
carrying
the
jewels
leaked
out
here
and
from
fullaway
office
he
answered
through
this
fellow
ebers
broke
in
fullaway
excitedly
it
all
rot
to
think
that
marlow
had
anything
to
do
with
it
great
scott
do
any
of
you
mean
to
suggest
that
she
engineered
several
murders
and
delkin
laughed
a
soft
cynical
laugh
you
lumping
a
lot
of
big
stuff
altogether
fullaway
he
remarked
drily
do
you
know
what
i
think
of
all
this
business
i
think
that
everybody
jumping
at
conclusions
there
are
lots
of
questions
problems
difficulties
that
want
solving
and
answering
before
i
come
to
any
conclusion
i
tell
you
what
they
are
he
went
on
bending
forward
in
his
lounge
chair
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
faces
around
him
and
beginning
to
tick
off
his
points
on
the
tips
of
his
fingers
listen
one
was
james
allerdyke
really
murdered
or
did
he
die
a
natural
death
two
had
james
allerdyke
those
jewels
in
his
possession
when
he
entered
that
s
hotel
at
hull
three
has
the
robbery
or
disappearance
of
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
theft
of
mademoiselle
de
longarde
property
four
was
that
man
lydenberg
shot
in
hull
as
a
result
of
some
connection
with
either
or
both
of
these
affairs
or
was
he
murdered
for
private
or
political
reasons
let
me
get
a
clear
understanding
of
everything
behind
all
these
problems
he
concluded
with
a
knowing
smile
and
tell
you
something
you
think
it
possible
that
the
nastirsevitch
affair
is
the
work
of
one
lot
and
the
lennard
affair
the
work
of
another
asked
allerdyke
thoughtfully
in
that
case
i
ask
you
a
question
delkin
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
my
cousin
james
the
frenchwoman
lisette
beaurepaire
and
his
valet
ebers
or
federman
or
herman
were
all
found
dead
under
similar
circumstances
come
now
aye
but
were
they
demanded
delkin
clapping
his
hands
together
with
a
smile
of
triumphantly
suggestive
doubt
were
they
you
do
know
and
the
expert
analysts
do
know
yet
and
perhaps
never
will
i
grant
you
that
there
a
strong
probability
that
ebers
and
the
french
maid
were
victims
of
the
same
murderer
but
that
does
prove
that
your
cousin
was
no
sir
my
impression
is
that
everybody
is
taking
too
much
for
granted
and
whether
it
offends
you
or
not
fullaway
and
my
good
you
ought
to
make
drastic
researches
into
your
office
procedure
you
know
what
i
mean
the
leakage
of
the
secret
sir
came
from
there
fullaway
rose
well
i
sha
do
any
good
by
sitting
here
he
said
a
little
huffily
if
i
going
to
begin
those
drastic
researches
i
better
begin
coming
allerdyke
the
two
men
walked
away
together
after
taking
leave
of
the
millionaire
and
the
princess
but
before
they
were
clear
of
the
courtyard
chilverton
caught
them
and
tapped
fullaway
on
the
elbow
say
he
said
confidentially
you
wo
mind
my
asking
you
who
this
van
koon
that
you
mentioned
man
from
our
side
who
been
here
in
london
all
this
spring
answered
fullaway
promptly
he
was
coming
with
allerdyke
and
me
just
now
but
he
turned
back
just
when
you
and
delkin
drove
in
here
chilverton
gave
fullaway
a
quick
look
did
he
see
me
he
asked
sure
replied
fullaway
asked
who
you
were
or
i
did
you
did
remarked
allerdyke
then
he
went
off
describe
him
said
chilverton
he
listened
attentively
while
fullaway
gave
him
a
sketch
of
van
koon
appearance
um
he
continued
do
you
mind
my
walking
to
your
hotel
with
you
i
believe
i
know
that
man
and
i
like
to
see
him
a
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
waldorf
who
had
been
there
when
the
three
men
went
out
together
at
one
fullaway
beckoned
him
seen
anything
of
van
koon
he
asked
van
koon
yes
sir
he
came
back
a
few
minutes
after
you
and
allerdyke
and
he
had
gone
out
got
a
from
upstairs
left
word
that
he
be
away
for
the
night
and
went
off
in
a
taxi
sir
answered
the
man
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
sir
before
fullaway
could
speak
chilverton
seized
the
arm
did
you
hear
him
give
the
any
direction
yes
sir
replied
the
man
promptly
pancras
station
sir
without
a
word
chilverton
turned
hurried
out
to
the
pavement
and
leapt
into
a
that
was
standing
there
unengaged
in
another
instant
the
was
off
and
allerdyke
and
fullaway
turned
to
each
other
then
allerdyke
laughed
that
why
van
koon
turned
back
fullaway
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
recognized
chilverton
now
then
why
did
that
recognition
make
him
run
and
who
is
he
chapter
xxviii
the
first
pursuit
for
a
moment
fullaway
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
staring
towards
the
mouth
of
kingsway
around
the
corner
of
which
chilverton
cab
had
already
disappeared
then
he
turned
gave
allerdyke
a
look
of
absolute
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
as
of
surrender
to
circumstances
walked
into
the
hotel
and
made
for
the
stairs
that
licks
everything
he
muttered
as
he
and
allerdyke
went
up
to
the
first
floor
tell
you
what
it
is
allerdyke
my
poor
brain
is
getting
into
a
whirl
we
had
quite
enough
excitement
this
morning
in
all
conscience
and
now
this
comes
on
top
of
it
now
how
in
creation
do
you
explain
this
last
occurrence
allerdyke
laughed
cynically
i
do
know
so
much
of
the
world
as
you
do
fullaway
he
said
but
i
do
think
this
needs
much
explanation
when
a
man
makes
himself
suddenly
scarce
at
sight
of
a
detective
i
should
say
that
man
knows
the
detective
wants
him
badly
my
impression
is
that
at
this
moment
your
friend
van
koon
is
running
away
from
chilverton
and
chilverton
going
after
him
and
they
were
at
that
moment
passing
the
room
which
van
koon
had
occupied
and
allerdyke
suddenly
remembered
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
seen
marlow
steal
out
of
it
suspiciously
and
furtively
and
when
its
proper
tenant
was
away
he
had
carefully
abstained
from
telling
fullaway
about
that
little
incident
preferring
to
wait
until
events
had
further
developed
should
he
tell
him
now
now
that
there
seemed
to
be
evidence
that
van
koon
himself
was
a
doubtful
character
he
hesitated
and
while
he
hesitated
fullaway
strode
on
flung
open
his
office
door
turned
to
the
at
the
back
and
took
out
some
letters
and
a
telegram
he
tore
the
telegram
open
and
the
next
instant
flung
it
on
the
table
with
a
fierce
exclamation
damn
it
all
allerdyke
he
said
waving
an
indignant
hand
at
the
bit
of
pink
paper
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
wicked
is
the
meaning
of
that
read
it
read
allerdyke
picked
the
telegram
up
and
read
it
aloud
regret
shall
be
unable
to
return
to
office
for
day
or
two
called
away
on
extremely
urgent
private
marlow
he
laughed
again
as
he
put
the
telegram
back
and
turned
to
fullaway
who
hands
plunged
deep
in
pockets
and
black
of
countenance
was
stamping
up
and
down
the
room
um
said
allerdyke
um
now
in
my
humble
opinion
fullaway
that
a
good
deal
queerer
than
the
van
koon
incident
for
look
you
here
your
secretary
was
talking
to
us
in
your
room
there
at
less
than
five
minutes
to
one
and
we
left
her
here
when
we
went
out
on
the
stroke
of
one
and
yet
look
at
the
wire
she
handed
that
in
at
the
east
strand
post
office
within
ten
minutes
after
we
left
her
what
do
you
make
of
that
damnation
exclaimed
fullaway
how
the
blazes
do
i
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
seem
to
be
surrounded
with
god
knows
what
hellish
mysteries
allerdyke
is
there
a
regular
devil
conspiracy
or
what
is
there
allerdyke
made
a
show
of
looking
at
the
telegram
again
in
reality
he
was
considering
matters
should
he
tell
fullaway
what
he
knew
he
was
more
than
a
little
tempted
to
do
so
but
his
natural
sense
of
caution
and
reserve
stopped
the
words
before
they
reached
his
tongue
and
he
took
another
tack
you
said
just
now
in
talking
to
delkin
that
you
the
greatest
confidence
in
this
marlow
and
had
the
best
references
with
her
fullaway
he
remarked
what
references
good
business
references
answered
fullaway
excitedly
the
best
firms
of
high
standing
in
the
city
could
have
had
better
go
and
ask
any
of
them
about
her
i
lay
my
last
dollar
they
will
say
the
same
capital
secretary
clever
woman
thoroughly
trustworthy
what
do
you
know
about
her
private
life
asked
allerdyke
what
the
deuce
has
the
woman
private
life
to
do
with
me
snapped
fullaway
i
know
nothing
so
long
as
she
comes
here
at
ten
stops
till
five
and
does
her
duty
hang
her
private
life
do
you
know
where
she
lives
asked
allerdyke
imperturbably
but
of
course
you
do
then
i
do
retorted
fullaway
somewhere
up
town
i
believe
west
end
somewhere
i
do
know
i
nothing
to
do
with
her
private
affairs
i
never
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
private
affairs
of
any
employee
of
mine
she
makes
her
private
affairs
have
something
to
do
with
you
though
said
allerdyke
tapping
the
telegram
significantly
but
in
my
opinion
that
wire
nothing
but
an
excuse
what
you
going
to
do
oh
i
do
know
exclaimed
fullaway
i
about
sick
of
the
whole
thing
allerdyke
pulled
out
his
watch
i
must
go
he
said
i
a
business
appointment
i
see
you
later
fullaway
made
no
reply
and
allerdyke
left
him
went
downstairs
and
sought
gaffney
whom
having
found
he
led
outside
to
the
street
how
soon
can
you
lay
hands
on
that
brother
of
yours
he
asked
twenty
minutes
in
a
cab
sir
replied
gaffney
get
a
cab
then
find
him
and
drive
both
of
you
to
the
warehouse
commanded
allerdyke
you
find
me
there
he
himself
got
a
cab
too
and
went
off
to
gresham
street
more
puzzled
and
doubtful
than
ever
he
closeted
himself
with
ambler
appleyard
and
told
him
all
the
details
of
the
eventful
morning
and
the
manager
listened
in
silence
taking
everything
in
and
making
his
own
mental
notes
and
with
his
usual
acuteness
of
perception
he
quickly
separated
the
important
from
the
momentarily
unimportant
you
do
want
to
bother
your
head
about
what
delkin
says
just
now
allerdyke
he
said
when
allerdyke
had
brought
this
story
to
an
end
never
mind
his
theories
there
may
be
a
lot
in
and
there
may
be
any
more
than
his
personal
opinion
in
never
mind
too
what
chilverton
wants
with
van
koon
nor
if
there
any
connection
between
van
koon
and
miss
slade
or
marlow
the
thing
to
do
is
to
find
her
you
think
she
hooked
it
said
allerdyke
i
should
say
that
something
said
by
some
of
you
at
that
talk
this
morning
in
fullaway
room
has
startled
her
into
action
answered
appleyard
now
let
get
at
facts
you
say
she
sent
that
wire
from
the
east
strand
post
office
within
ten
minutes
of
your
leaving
her
very
well
i
should
say
she
was
on
her
way
to
arundel
street
to
see
rayner
alias
ramsay
i
wish
we
had
a
constant
watch
kept
on
him
but
soon
repair
that
if
you
sent
for
young
gaffney
the
two
gaffneys
arrived
at
that
moment
and
appleyard
after
some
further
talk
assigned
them
their
duties
gaffney
the
chauffeur
was
to
go
at
once
and
get
himself
a
room
at
an
inn
in
close
proximity
to
the
pompadour
hotel
so
that
he
would
be
at
appleyard
disposal
at
any
hour
of
the
coming
evening
and
night
albert
gaffney
the
clerk
was
to
devote
himself
to
watching
rayner
he
was
to
follow
rayner
wherever
rayner
went
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
clytemnestra
house
that
afternoon
even
if
rayner
should
leave
town
by
motor
or
by
train
he
was
to
follow
for
as
appleyard
sagely
observed
it
was
not
likely
that
marlow
alias
miss
slade
would
return
to
the
pompadour
hotel
that
night
if
her
fears
had
been
aroused
by
what
had
taken
place
that
morning
and
it
was
a
reasonable
presumption
that
if
she
and
rayner
were
in
league
she
would
have
communicated
with
him
on
leaving
fullaway
office
and
that
they
would
meet
again
somewhere
before
the
day
was
over
the
only
thing
now
said
appleyard
when
the
two
gaffneys
had
been
presented
with
funds
sufficient
to
carry
each
through
all
possible
immediate
emergencies
is
to
arrange
for
a
meeting
there
are
two
matters
we
want
to
be
certain
about
first
if
albert
gaffney
witnesses
any
meeting
between
rayner
and
miss
slade
and
in
that
case
if
he
can
tell
us
where
they
go
and
what
they
do
second
if
they
both
return
or
either
of
them
returns
to
the
pompadour
so
it
had
better
be
near
the
pompadour
somewhere
in
that
district
anyhow
can
you
suggest
any
place
he
continued
turning
to
the
chauffeur
you
know
that
district
well
do
you
tell
you
the
very
spot
sir
answered
gaffney
promptly
lancaster
gate
itself
sir
close
by
there
convenient
pub
sir
stands
back
a
bit
from
the
road
sir
quiet
corners
what
time
sir
appleyard
fixed
eleven
by
that
time
he
said
he
should
know
if
rayner
and
miss
slade
had
returned
to
the
pompadour
by
that
time
too
albert
gaffney
would
be
in
a
position
to
report
his
own
doings
and
progress
and
so
the
two
gaffneys
went
off
on
their
respective
missions
and
allerdyke
looked
at
his
manager
and
made
a
grimace
it
like
a
lot
of
blind
men
seeking
for
something
they
could
see
if
it
was
shoved
under
their
very
noses
ambler
he
said
cynically
is
it
any
good
maybe
replied
appleyard
that
albert
gaffney
a
smart
chap
not
lose
sight
of
rayner
once
he
begins
to
track
him
and
i
certain
as
certain
can
be
that
if
miss
slade
in
a
hole
it
rayner
she
turn
to
well
we
can
only
wait
now
what
you
going
to
do
mr
allerdyke
let
have
a
bit
of
a
relief
answered
allerdyke
suddenly
let
dine
together
somewhere
and
go
to
a
theatre
or
something
until
it
time
to
keep
this
appointment
and
not
a
word
more
of
the
whole
thing
till
then
you
forget
that
i
got
to
look
in
at
the
pompadour
last
thing
to
see
if
those
two
are
there
as
usual
remarked
appleyard
but
that
only
take
a
few
minutes
i
can
call
there
on
our
way
to
the
rendezvous
all
right
no
more
of
it
until
eleven
then
albert
gaffney
was
already
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
of
the
appointed
when
the
other
three
arrived
there
appleyard
had
already
ascertained
that
neither
rayner
nor
miss
slade
had
returned
to
the
pompadour
gaffney
the
chauffeur
who
had
been
keeping
an
eye
on
the
exterior
of
that
establishment
had
nothing
to
tell
and
albert
face
was
somewhat
dismal
and
his
eye
inclined
to
something
like
an
aggrieved
surliness
as
he
joined
the
and
answered
their
first
question
it
not
my
fault
gentlemen
he
whispered
bending
towards
the
others
over
the
little
table
at
which
they
were
all
seated
but
the
truth
is
i
been
baulked
at
the
last
moment
as
you
may
term
it
just
when
things
were
getting
really
interesting
have
you
seen
anything
asked
appleyard
i
give
you
it
in
proper
order
sir
replied
albert
gaffney
seen
both
of
followed
until
this
confounded
accident
happened
this
is
the
story
of
it
i
kept
watch
there
outside
house
you
know
where
i
mean
till
near
on
to
six
then
he
came
out
but
he
did
get
into
his
motor
though
it
was
waiting
for
him
he
sent
it
away
then
he
walked
to
the
temple
station
and
i
heard
him
book
for
cannon
street
so
did
i
and
followed
him
he
got
out
at
cannon
street
and
went
up
into
the
main
line
station
and
to
the
bookstall
there
he
met
her
she
was
waiting
they
talked
a
bit
walking
about
then
they
went
into
the
hotel
i
had
an
idea
that
perhaps
they
were
going
to
dine
there
so
as
i
was
togged
up
for
any
eventualities
i
followed
in
they
did
dine
there
so
did
i
keeping
an
eye
on
they
sat
some
time
over
and
after
their
dinner
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
something
or
somebody
at
last
a
man
commercial
sort
of
man
came
in
and
went
up
to
them
he
sat
down
and
had
a
glass
of
wine
and
they
all
three
talked
very
confidential
talk
you
could
see
at
last
they
all
left
and
went
down
to
the
yard
outside
the
station
and
got
into
a
all
three
i
got
another
gave
the
driver
a
quiet
hint
as
to
what
i
was
after
and
told
him
to
keep
the
other
cab
in
view
so
he
did
for
a
time
they
went
first
to
a
little
restaurant
near
liverpool
street
station
she
and
the
chap
got
out
and
went
in
stopped
in
the
cab
the
other
two
came
back
after
a
bit
with
another
man
similar
sort
and
all
three
joined
then
they
went
off
towards
aldgate
way
and
we
were
keeping
nicely
behind
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
blooming
came
to
grief
right
between
us
and
them
and
blocked
the
traffic
and
though
i
nearly
broke
my
neck
in
trying
to
get
through
and
spot
them
it
was
no
use
they
clean
disappeared
but
i
got
the
number
of
the
cab
they
took
from
cannon
street
appleyard
nodded
approval
good
he
said
that
something
gaffney
a
good
deal
we
can
work
on
from
that
well
he
continued
turning
to
allerdyke
i
think
there
nothing
else
we
can
do
we
better
meet
all
of
us
at
gresham
street
at
say
ten
morning
then
i
shall
be
able
to
say
if
they
return
to
the
pompadour
it
my
impression
they
wo
but
we
shall
see
allerdyke
presently
drove
him
to
his
hotel
wondering
all
the
way
what
these
last
doings
might
really
mean
they
were
surprising
enough
but
there
was
another
surprise
awaiting
him
as
he
walked
into
the
waldorf
the
stopped
him
there
a
gentleman
for
you
sir
in
the
he
said
been
waiting
a
good
hour
name
of
chettle
chapter
xxix
the
parcel
from
hull
chettle
sat
alone
in
the
a
monument
of
patient
resignation
to
his
fate
his
hands
were
bunched
on
the
head
of
his
his
chin
propped
on
his
hands
his
eyes
were
bent
on
a
certain
spot
on
the
carpet
with
a
fixed
stare
and
when
allerdyke
entered
he
sprang
up
as
if
roused
from
a
fitful
slumber
i
should
ha
been
asleep
in
another
minute
allerdyke
he
said
apologetically
been
waiting
over
an
hour
sir
and
i
been
at
it
hard
at
it
every
minute
since
i
left
you
and
i
had
to
come
i
news
come
up
said
allerdyke
i
news
too
it
been
naught
else
but
news
all
day
you
have
seen
fullaway
while
you
been
waiting
seen
nobody
but
the
hotel
folks
answered
the
detective
he
followed
allerdyke
up
to
his
private
and
sighed
wearily
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
i
he
repeated
fair
weary
have
a
drink
said
allerdyke
setting
out
his
decanter
and
a
syphon
take
a
stiff
i
have
one
myself
i
tired
too
i
would
like
this
game
to
be
on
long
chettle
it
too
exhausting
but
by
the
lord
harry
i
believe
it
coming
to
an
end
at
last
the
detective
who
had
gladly
helped
himself
to
allerdyke
whisky
took
a
long
pull
at
his
glass
and
sighed
with
relief
i
believe
so
myself
allerdyke
he
said
i
do
indeed
things
are
clearing
sir
though
heaven
knows
they
thick
enough
still
you
say
you
fresh
news
allerdyke
lighted
a
cigar
and
pushed
the
box
to
his
guest
your
news
first
he
said
i
daresay
it
a
bit
out
of
the
complete
web
let
see
if
we
can
fit
it
in
it
this
answered
chettle
pulling
his
chair
nearer
to
the
table
at
which
he
and
his
host
sat
when
i
got
back
to
hull
they
told
me
at
the
police
headquarters
that
a
young
man
had
been
in
two
or
three
times
while
i
was
away
asking
if
he
could
see
the
london
detective
who
was
down
about
the
station
hotel
affair
they
told
him
i
gone
up
to
town
again
and
tried
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
but
he
would
tell
them
anything
said
he
either
see
me
or
go
up
to
london
himself
so
then
they
let
him
know
i
was
coming
back
and
told
him
he
probably
find
me
there
at
noon
and
at
noon
he
turns
up
at
the
a
young
fellow
about
or
so
who
looked
like
what
he
was
a
clerk
a
very
cute
sharp
chap
he
was
the
sort
naturally
keen
about
his
own
interests
name
of
martindale
and
before
he
say
a
word
he
wanted
to
see
my
credentials
and
made
me
swear
to
treat
what
he
said
as
private
and
then
he
pulled
out
a
copy
of
that
reward
bill
of
yours
and
wanted
to
know
a
rare
lot
about
that
all
of
which
amounted
to
wanting
to
find
out
what
chance
he
had
of
getting
hold
of
some
of
the
fifty
thousand
if
not
all
and
continued
chettle
with
a
laugh
i
a
lot
of
talking
and
explaining
and
wheedling
to
do
before
he
tell
anything
had
he
aught
to
tell
asked
allerdyke
so
many
of
think
they
have
and
then
they
have
oh
he
something
to
tell
replied
chettle
right
enough
he
a
good
deal
to
tell
this
he
told
me
at
last
as
if
every
word
he
let
out
was
worth
a
ransom
that
he
was
a
parcels
office
clerk
in
the
north
eastern
railway
station
at
hull
and
that
since
the
of
may
until
the
day
before
yesterday
he
been
away
in
the
north
of
scotland
on
his
holidays
been
home
to
his
people
in
fact
he
is
a
scotsman
which
of
course
accounts
for
his
keenness
about
the
money
now
then
on
the
night
of
may
the
night
as
you
know
allerdyke
of
your
cousin
supposed
murder
but
anyway
of
his
arrival
at
hull
this
young
man
martindale
was
on
duty
in
the
parcels
office
till
a
very
late
hour
about
ten
to
a
quarter
past
ten
as
near
as
he
could
recollect
a
gentleman
came
into
the
parcels
office
carrying
a
small
square
parcel
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
sealed
in
several
places
with
black
wax
he
wanted
to
know
when
the
next
express
would
be
leaving
for
london
and
if
he
could
send
the
parcel
by
it
martindale
told
him
there
would
be
an
express
leaving
for
selby
very
shortly
and
there
would
be
a
connection
there
for
a
great
northern
express
to
king
cross
the
gentleman
then
wanted
to
know
what
time
his
parcel
would
be
likely
to
be
delivered
in
london
if
he
sent
it
by
that
train
martindale
told
him
that
as
near
as
he
could
say
it
would
be
delivered
by
noon
on
the
next
morning
and
added
that
he
could
by
paying
an
extra
fee
have
it
specially
registered
and
delivered
the
gentleman
at
once
acceded
to
this
handed
the
parcel
over
paid
for
it
and
left
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
that
martindale
himself
gave
the
parcel
to
the
guard
of
the
outgoing
train
chettle
paused
for
a
moment
and
took
a
reflective
pull
at
his
glass
now
then
he
went
on
after
an
evident
recollecting
of
his
facts
martindale
of
course
never
saw
the
gentleman
again
and
dismissed
such
a
very
ordinary
matter
from
his
mind
early
next
morning
he
went
off
on
his
holiday
where
he
went
right
away
up
in
sutherland
papers
were
few
and
far
between
he
only
heard
mere
bits
of
news
about
all
this
affair
but
when
he
got
back
he
turned
up
the
hull
newspapers
and
became
convinced
that
the
man
who
sent
that
parcel
was
your
cousin
aye
said
allerdyke
nodding
his
head
aye
i
expected
that
he
was
sure
it
was
your
cousin
continued
chettle
from
the
description
of
him
in
the
papers
and
from
one
or
two
photos
of
him
that
had
appeared
though
as
you
know
allerdyke
those
were
poor
things
but
to
make
sure
i
showed
him
the
photo
which
is
inside
the
man
he
said
at
once
should
have
known
him
again
anywhere
i
a
particularly
good
look
at
him
very
well
that
established
who
the
sender
of
the
parcel
was
now
then
the
next
thing
was
to
whom
was
it
sent
well
this
martindale
had
copied
down
the
name
and
address
from
the
station
books
and
he
handed
me
the
slip
of
paper
can
you
make
any
guess
at
it
mr
allerdyke
damn
replied
allerdyke
speak
out
chettle
leaned
nearer
with
an
instinctive
glance
at
the
door
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
that
parcel
was
addressed
to
franklin
fullaway
the
waldorf
hotel
aldwych
london
he
said
there
allerdyke
slowly
rose
from
his
seat
stared
at
his
visitor
across
the
floor
as
if
he
had
some
instinctive
notion
of
going
somewhere
and
then
suddenly
sat
down
again
aye
he
said
aye
but
was
it
ever
delivered
i
coming
to
that
replied
chettle
that
of
course
is
the
big
thing
the
prime
consideration
i
heard
all
this
young
fellow
martindale
had
to
tell
nothing
much
more
than
that
except
small
details
as
to
what
would
be
the
likely
progress
of
the
parcel
and
then
i
gave
him
strict
instructions
to
keep
his
own
counsel
until
i
saw
him
again
after
which
i
caught
the
afternoon
train
to
town
martindale
had
told
me
where
the
parcel
would
be
delivered
from
so
as
soon
as
i
arrived
at
king
cross
i
went
to
the
proper
place
i
had
to
tell
of
course
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
after
and
to
produce
my
credentials
before
they
turned
up
their
books
and
papers
to
trace
the
delivery
of
the
parcel
that
of
course
was
a
long
or
difficult
matter
as
i
had
the
exact
date
may
they
soon
put
the
delivery
sheet
of
that
particular
morning
before
me
and
there
it
all
was
and
it
was
delivered
to
and
received
by
who
broke
in
allerdyke
eagerly
who
man
signed
for
by
mary
marlow
for
franklin
fullaway
answered
chettle
in
the
same
low
tones
delivered
here
about
twelve
so
there
you
are
that
is
if
you
know
where
we
are
allerdyke
whose
cigar
had
gone
out
relighted
it
with
a
trembling
hand
my
god
he
said
in
a
fierce
concentrated
voice
as
he
flung
the
match
away
this
is
getting
you
sure
there
was
no
mistaking
the
signature
he
went
on
interrupting
himself
no
mistake
about
it
it
was
a
woman
writing
and
an
educated
woman
writing
anyway
said
chettle
and
plain
enough
but
there
was
one
thing
that
rather
struck
me
and
that
they
could
explain
though
they
said
i
could
have
it
explained
by
inquiry
of
the
clerk
who
had
the
books
in
charge
on
may
and
the
boy
who
actually
delivered
the
parcel
neither
of
was
about
this
evening
what
demanded
allerdyke
why
this
answered
chettle
the
parcel
had
evidently
been
signed
for
twice
the
line
on
which
the
signatures
were
placed
had
two
initials
in
pencil
on
it
scribbled
hurriedly
the
initials
were
over
that
was
the
other
in
ink
what
i
tell
you
mary
marlow
for
frank
fullaway
allerdyke
let
his
mind
go
back
to
the
events
of
may
you
say
the
parcel
was
delivered
here
at
noon
on
may
he
said
presently
of
course
fullaway
was
here
then
he
set
off
to
me
at
hull
two
or
three
hours
before
that
he
joined
me
at
hull
soon
after
two
that
day
and
what
i
wondering
is
does
he
know
of
that
parcel
arrival
here
in
his
absence
did
he
ever
get
it
if
he
did
why
has
he
never
mentioned
it
to
me
coming
as
it
did
from
james
there
a
much
more
important
question
than
that
allerdyke
said
chettle
this
what
was
in
that
parcel
allerdyke
started
so
far
he
had
been
concentrating
on
the
facts
given
him
by
the
detective
further
he
had
not
yet
gone
why
he
asked
a
sudden
suspicion
beginning
to
dawn
on
him
good
god
you
do
suggest
my
belief
allerdyke
said
chettle
quietly
and
emphatically
is
that
the
parcel
contained
the
russian
lady
jewels
i
do
believe
it
and
i
lay
anything
i
right
too
allerdyke
shook
his
head
nay
nay
he
said
incredulously
i
ca
think
that
james
would
send
a
quarter
of
a
million
pounds
worth
of
jewels
in
a
brown
paper
parcel
by
train
come
now
chettle
shook
his
head
too
but
in
contradiction
i
known
of
much
stranger
things
than
that
allerdyke
he
said
confidently
very
much
stranger
things
your
cousin
according
to
your
account
of
him
was
an
uncommonly
sharp
man
he
was
quick
at
sizing
up
things
and
people
he
was
the
sort
as
you
represented
him
to
me
that
was
what
termed
fertile
in
resource
now
i
been
theorizing
a
bit
as
i
came
up
in
the
train
one
got
to
in
my
line
you
know
supposing
your
cousin
got
an
idea
that
thieves
were
on
his
track
supposing
he
himself
fancied
that
there
was
danger
in
that
hotel
at
hull
what
would
occur
to
him
but
to
get
rid
of
his
valuable
consignment
as
we
call
it
and
what
particular
danger
was
there
in
sending
a
very
parcel
as
he
did
the
thing
done
every
day
by
train
or
post
every
day
valuable
parcels
of
diamonds
for
instance
are
sent
between
london
and
paris
the
chances
of
that
parcel
being
lost
between
hull
and
this
hotel
were
infinitesimal
i
honestly
believe
sir
that
those
jewels
were
in
that
parcel
sent
to
be
safe
in
that
case
you
have
thought
he
have
wired
fullaway
of
their
dispatch
said
allerdyke
how
do
we
know
that
he
did
intend
to
first
thing
in
the
morning
asked
chettle
he
probably
did
intend
to
but
he
was
there
to
do
it
in
the
morning
poor
gentleman
no
and
now
the
thing
is
allerdyke
prompt
action
what
do
you
think
sir
you
mean
go
and
tell
everything
to
your
people
at
headquarters
asked
allerdyke
i
shall
have
to
answered
chettle
there
no
option
for
me
now
what
i
meant
was
are
you
prepared
to
tell
them
all
you
know
yes
replied
allerdyke
at
least
i
will
be
in
the
morning
first
thing
i
just
tell
you
how
things
have
gone
now
he
continued
when
he
had
given
chettle
a
full
account
of
the
recent
happenings
you
stay
here
you
can
have
my
chauffeur
room
next
to
mine
and
in
the
morning
i
telephone
to
appleyard
to
meet
us
outside
of
new
scotland
yard
and
after
a
word
or
two
with
him
we
see
your
chief
and
then
chettle
shook
his
head
if
that
woman
got
a
night
start
allerdyke
he
began
ca
help
it
now
said
allerdyke
decisively
besides
you
do
know
what
appleyard
may
have
learned
during
the
night
but
when
appleyard
met
them
in
whitehall
next
morning
in
response
to
allerdyke
telephone
summons
his
only
news
was
that
neither
rayner
nor
miss
slade
had
returned
to
the
pompadour
and
without
another
word
allerdyke
motioned
chettle
to
lead
the
way
to
the
man
in
authority
chapter
xxx
the
packet
in
the
safe
it
was
to
a
hastily
called
together
gathering
of
high
police
officials
that
the
three
visitors
told
all
they
knew
one
after
another
they
related
their
various
stories
chettle
of
his
doings
and
discoveries
at
hull
allerdyke
of
what
had
gone
on
at
the
hotel
appleyard
of
the
mysterious
double
identity
of
the
woman
who
was
miss
slade
in
one
place
and
marlow
in
another
the
officials
listened
quietly
and
absorbedly
rarely
interrupting
the
narrators
except
to
ask
a
searching
question
and
in
the
end
they
talked
together
apart
after
which
all
went
away
except
the
man
who
had
kept
his
hands
on
the
reins
from
the
beginning
he
turned
to
his
visitors
with
an
air
of
decision
well
of
course
there
but
one
thing
to
be
done
now
he
said
we
must
get
a
warrant
for
this
woman
arrest
at
once
we
must
also
get
a
search
warrant
and
examine
her
belongings
at
that
private
hotel
told
us
of
appleyard
all
that
shall
be
done
immediately
but
first
i
want
you
to
tell
me
one
or
two
things
what
are
those
two
men
you
spoke
of
doing
the
gaffneys
one
of
them
the
chauffeur
is
hanging
about
the
pompadour
replied
appleyard
the
other
albert
has
gone
down
to
cannon
street
to
see
if
he
can
trace
the
driver
of
the
in
which
rayner
and
miss
slade
drove
away
from
there
last
night
he
do
no
harm
in
trying
to
find
that
out
observed
the
chief
but
i
should
like
to
see
him
i
want
to
ask
some
questions
about
the
man
who
joined
those
two
after
dinner
at
cannon
street
last
night
and
the
other
man
whom
he
saw
them
take
up
near
liverpool
street
station
will
he
keep
himself
in
touch
with
your
warehouse
in
gresham
street
sure
to
answered
appleyard
then
just
telephone
to
your
people
there
and
tell
them
to
tell
him
if
he
comes
in
asking
for
you
to
come
along
and
seek
you
here
said
the
chief
i
afraid
i
ca
spare
either
you
or
allerdyke
for
your
joint
information
be
wanted
presently
for
these
warrants
and
when
we
got
them
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
both
of
you
to
the
pompadour
you
going
to
search
asked
allerdyke
when
appleyard
had
gone
to
the
telephone
you
think
you
may
find
something
there
there
enough
evidence
to
justify
a
search
answered
the
chief
naturally
we
want
to
know
all
we
can
but
i
should
say
that
if
mixed
up
with
a
gang
and
if
they
got
those
jewels
through
her
as
seems
uncommonly
likely
she
have
been
ready
for
a
start
at
any
minute
and
the
probability
is
we
find
nothing
to
help
us
the
great
thing
of
course
will
be
to
get
hold
of
the
woman
herself
it
a
most
unfortunate
thing
that
albert
gaffney
was
stopped
from
following
that
cab
last
night
i
no
opinion
allerdyke
of
your
amateur
detective
as
a
rule
but
from
appleyard
account
of
him
this
one
seems
to
have
done
very
well
if
we
only
knew
where
those
two
went
appleyard
presently
came
back
from
the
telephone
with
a
face
alive
with
fresh
news
albert
gaffney
at
the
warehouse
now
he
announced
i
just
had
a
word
with
him
he
found
the
driver
an
hour
ago
and
he
got
the
information
he
wanted
and
i
afraid
it
nothing
what
is
it
anyhow
asked
the
chief
with
a
smile
perhaps
albert
gaffney
does
know
its
value
the
man
drove
them
all
four
to
the
corner
of
whitechapel
church
said
appleyard
there
he
set
them
down
and
there
he
left
them
that
all
well
that
something
anyway
remarked
the
chief
it
carries
the
thing
on
another
stage
now
we
leave
that
and
attend
to
our
own
business
the
pompadour
private
hotel
like
most
establishments
of
its
class
in
bayswater
was
a
place
of
peace
and
of
comparative
solitude
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
it
was
busy
enough
up
to
ten
in
the
morning
and
it
began
to
be
busy
enough
again
by
six
in
the
evening
but
from
ten
to
six
more
than
of
its
denizens
were
not
to
be
found
within
its
walls
the
business
man
had
gone
to
the
city
the
professional
women
had
departed
to
their
offices
nothing
of
humanity
but
a
few
elderly
widows
and
spinsters
and
an
old
gentleman
or
two
were
left
in
the
various
rooms
everything
therefore
was
quiet
enough
when
the
chief
accompanied
by
chettle
drove
up
entered
the
hall
and
asked
to
see
the
manager
and
manageress
as
for
allerdyke
and
appleyard
who
naturally
felt
considerable
dislike
to
appearing
on
this
particular
scene
of
operations
they
were
a
few
hundred
yards
away
walking
about
just
within
the
confines
of
kensington
gardens
and
waiting
with
more
or
less
patience
until
the
police
officials
came
to
them
with
news
of
the
result
of
the
search
the
manageress
of
the
hotel
a
smart
lady
who
wore
dignified
black
gowns
all
day
long
stuff
in
the
morning
and
silk
at
night
as
if
she
were
a
barrister
gradually
advancing
in
grandeur
gazed
at
the
two
callers
with
some
suspicion
as
she
ushered
them
into
a
private
room
at
the
back
of
her
office
the
chief
an
irreproachably
attired
man
might
have
been
an
army
gentleman
she
thought
an
instinctive
wonder
rose
in
her
mind
as
to
whether
he
was
not
some
elderly
man
of
standing
who
accompanied
by
his
valet
desired
to
arrange
about
a
suite
of
rooms
but
his
first
words
gave
her
an
unpleasant
shock
she
felt
for
all
the
world
as
if
somebody
had
suddenly
turned
a
shower
of
water
on
her
now
said
the
chief
your
husband
the
manager
is
out
and
you
are
in
sole
and
responsible
charge
i
understand
pray
do
be
alarmed
this
is
nothing
that
concerns
you
or
your
affairs
personally
and
we
will
endeavor
to
arrange
everything
so
that
you
have
no
annoyance
the
fact
of
the
case
is
we
are
police
officers
from
the
criminal
investigation
department
at
new
scotland
yard
and
i
hold
two
warrants
just
granted
by
a
justice
of
peace
which
are
in
relation
to
an
inmate
of
your
hotel
the
manageress
dropped
into
a
chair
and
stared
at
her
visitors
police
officers
warrants
justices
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
highly
respectable
bayswater
existence
that
she
had
ever
been
brought
into
contact
with
these
dreadful
things
and
an
inmate
of
her
establishment
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
she
exclaimed
in
accents
a
warrant
that
means
you
want
to
arrest
somebody
an
inmate
surely
none
of
my
servants
nothing
to
do
with
servants
interrupted
the
chief
i
said
an
inmate
pray
do
be
alarmed
we
want
a
young
lady
who
is
known
to
you
as
miss
mary
slade
the
manageress
got
up
as
quickly
as
she
had
sat
down
for
one
moment
she
gazed
at
her
visitor
as
if
he
had
demanded
her
very
life
the
next
her
lip
curled
in
scorn
miss
slade
she
exclaimed
impossible
sir
miss
slade
is
a
young
lady
of
the
very
highest
respectability
she
has
resided
in
this
hotel
for
three
years
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
a
residence
of
three
months
under
your
roof
is
enough
to
confer
an
irreproachable
character
on
any
one
replied
the
chief
with
a
polite
smile
but
the
fact
remains
i
have
here
a
warrant
for
miss
slade
arrest
never
mind
on
what
charge
and
here
another
empowering
me
to
search
her
room
or
rooms
her
trunk
any
property
she
has
in
this
house
and
as
time
presses
i
must
ask
you
to
give
us
every
facility
in
the
performance
of
our
unpleasant
duty
but
first
a
question
or
two
miss
slade
is
not
at
home
she
is
not
replied
the
manageress
emphatically
and
i
think
she
did
not
return
home
last
night
suggested
the
chief
no
she
did
assented
the
much
perplexed
woman
that
quite
true
was
that
unusual
asked
the
chief
the
manageress
bit
her
lip
she
did
not
want
to
talk
but
she
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
law
compelled
speech
well
i
do
know
what
it
all
about
she
said
and
i
do
want
to
say
anything
that
would
bring
trouble
to
miss
slade
but
it
was
unusual
for
two
reasons
i
never
known
miss
slade
to
be
away
from
here
for
a
night
except
when
she
went
for
her
usual
month
holiday
and
surprised
that
she
should
stop
away
without
giving
me
word
or
sending
a
telephone
message
then
her
absence
was
unusual
said
the
chief
smiling
now
was
there
anything
else
that
was
unusual
last
night
in
connection
with
it
the
manageress
started
and
looked
at
her
visitor
as
if
she
half
suspected
him
of
possessing
the
power
of
seeing
through
brick
walls
well
she
said
a
little
reluctantly
there
was
certainly
another
of
our
guests
away
last
night
too
one
who
scarcely
ever
is
away
and
certainly
never
without
letting
us
know
that
he
going
away
and
quite
true
he
a
very
great
friend
of
miss
slade
somebody
did
say
jokingly
this
morning
that
perhaps
they
run
away
and
got
married
ah
said
the
chief
with
another
smile
i
scarcely
think
miss
slade
would
contract
such
an
important
engagement
at
this
moment
she
has
evidently
much
else
to
think
about
but
now
let
us
see
miss
apartment
if
you
please
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
accompany
us
not
only
did
the
manageress
accompany
them
but
the
manager
also
who
just
then
arrived
and
was
filled
with
proper
horror
to
hear
that
such
things
were
happening
but
being
a
man
he
knew
that
it
is
every
citizen
duty
to
assist
the
police
and
he
accepted
his
fate
cheerfully
and
bade
his
wife
give
the
gentlemen
every
help
that
lay
in
her
power
after
which
both
conducted
the
two
visitors
to
miss
slade
room
and
became
fascinated
in
acting
as
spectators
miss
slade
apartment
was
precisely
that
of
any
other
young
lady
of
refined
taste
it
was
a
roomy
apartment
half
bedroom
half
and
it
was
bright
and
gay
with
books
and
pictures
and
evidences
of
literary
and
artistic
fancies
and
leanings
and
chettle
taking
a
first
comprehensive
look
round
went
straight
to
the
mantelpiece
and
pointed
out
a
certain
neatly
framed
photograph
to
his
superior
that
it
sir
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
what
the
other
was
taken
from
you
know
sir
james
marshall
said
she
said
she
was
going
to
have
it
framed
odd
ai
it
sir
if
she
really
is
implicated
the
chief
agreed
with
his
man
it
was
certainly
a
very
odd
thing
that
miss
slade
alias
marlow
if
she
really
had
any
concern
with
the
murder
of
james
allerdyke
should
put
his
photograph
in
a
fairly
expensive
silver
frame
and
hang
it
where
she
could
look
at
it
every
day
but
as
chettle
sagely
remarked
you
never
can
tell
and
you
never
can
account
and
you
never
know
and
meanwhile
there
was
the
urgent
business
on
hand
the
business
on
hand
came
to
nothing
manager
and
manageress
watched
with
interested
amazement
while
the
two
searchers
went
through
everything
in
that
room
with
a
thoroughness
and
rapidity
produced
by
long
practice
they
were
astounded
at
the
deftness
with
which
the
chettle
explored
drawers
and
trunks
and
the
chief
peered
into
wardrobes
and
cupboards
and
examined
desks
and
tables
but
they
were
not
so
much
astonished
as
the
two
detectives
themselves
were
for
in
all
that
room
always
excepting
the
photograph
of
james
allerdyke
there
was
not
a
single
object
a
scrap
of
paper
anything
whatever
which
connected
the
miss
slade
of
the
pompadour
with
the
marlow
of
fullaway
or
bore
reference
to
the
matter
in
hand
the
searchers
finally
retired
utterly
baffled
drawn
blank
murmured
the
chief
he
turned
to
the
i
suppose
you
have
nothing
of
miss
slade
he
said
nothing
confined
to
your
care
eh
the
manageress
glanced
at
her
husband
with
whom
she
had
kept
up
a
whispered
conversation
the
manager
nodded
better
tell
them
he
said
no
good
keeping
anything
back
ah
said
the
chief
you
have
something
a
small
parcel
admitted
the
manageress
which
she
gave
me
a
few
days
ago
to
lock
up
in
our
safe
she
said
it
contained
something
valuable
and
she
had
anything
to
lock
it
up
in
it
in
the
safe
now
i
afraid
we
must
see
it
said
the
chief
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
accosted
the
party
and
looked
at
the
chief
narrowly
name
of
chettle
sir
he
asked
you
wanted
at
our
telephone
urgent
the
chief
motioned
to
chettle
who
went
off
with
the
he
himself
followed
the
manageress
into
her
office
she
unlocked
a
safe
rummaged
amongst
its
contents
and
handed
him
a
small
square
parcel
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
sealed
with
black
wax
before
he
could
open
it
chettle
returned
serious
and
puzzled
and
whispered
to
him
then
with
the
shortest
of
the
two
officers
hurried
away
from
the
pompadour
the
chief
carrying
the
little
parcel
tightly
grasped
in
his
right
hand
chapter
xxxi
the
hyde
park
once
outside
the
pompadour
hotel
the
chief
and
his
subordinate
hurried
at
a
great
pace
towards
the
lancaster
gate
entrance
to
kensington
gardens
and
when
they
had
crossed
bayswater
road
the
superior
pulled
himself
up
took
a
breath
and
looked
around
him
no
sign
of
them
yet
chettle
he
observed
did
he
say
at
once
said
they
be
on
their
way
in
two
minutes
sir
answered
chettle
and
it
would
take
them
many
minutes
to
run
up
here
i
wonder
what
it
all
about
mused
the
chief
some
new
development
since
we
left
the
yard
of
course
well
i
think
we
may
probably
find
something
in
this
parcel
chettle
that
will
surprise
us
as
much
as
any
new
development
can
possibly
do
it
strikes
me
here
they
are
sir
interrupted
chettle
he
had
lingered
on
the
kerb
looking
towards
the
rise
of
the
road
going
towards
the
marble
arch
and
his
quick
eyes
had
spotted
a
closed
which
came
out
of
the
marlborough
gate
at
full
speed
and
turned
down
in
their
direction
blindway
and
two
others
he
announced
seems
to
be
in
force
sir
anyhow
the
pulled
up
at
the
little
gate
leading
into
kensington
gardens
by
the
and
blindway
followed
by
two
other
men
hurriedly
descended
and
joined
his
superior
well
what
is
it
demanded
the
chief
something
new
and
about
this
affair
blindway
made
a
gesture
suggesting
that
they
should
enter
the
gardens
once
within
he
drew
the
chief
aside
leaving
his
companions
with
chettle
about
half
an
hour
ago
he
said
a
telephone
message
came
on
from
the
city
police
they
said
they
received
some
queerish
information
about
this
affair
but
only
particularly
about
the
death
of
that
man
down
at
the
hotel
in
the
docks
their
information
ran
to
this
that
the
actual
murderer
has
an
appointment
with
some
of
his
associates
this
afternoon
at
that
in
hyde
park
and
that
if
the
city
police
would
send
some
men
up
there
he
be
pointed
out
so
the
city
lot
want
us
to
join
them
and
i
was
sent
along
to
meet
you
here
sir
i
brought
those
two
men
and
of
course
there
chettle
we
all
to
go
along
to
this
not
in
a
body
naturally
but
to
sort
of
drop
in
and
to
wait
events
of
course
sir
that
last
murder
occurred
in
the
city
and
so
the
city
police
want
to
come
in
at
it
and
no
further
details
asked
the
chief
obviously
puzzled
nothing
as
to
who
going
to
point
out
the
murderer
and
so
on
nothing
replied
blindway
at
least
nothing
reported
to
us
all
got
to
do
is
to
be
there
on
the
spot
and
to
keep
our
eyes
open
for
the
critical
moment
and
what
time
is
the
critical
moment
to
be
asked
the
chief
a
little
superciliously
it
all
seems
remarkably
vague
blindway
why
they
give
us
more
news
do
know
sir
they
seemed
purposely
vague
replied
the
detective
however
the
time
fixed
is
two
to
be
there
about
two
that
was
the
request
at
least
four
of
us
the
chief
turned
and
summoned
the
other
three
men
you
better
break
up
he
said
two
of
you
approach
the
place
from
one
way
two
from
another
it
now
a
one
you
plenty
of
time
stroll
across
the
park
to
this
spot
i
join
you
by
two
i
believe
you
can
get
light
refreshments
at
this
get
yourselves
something
so
as
to
look
like
mere
loungers
but
keep
your
eyes
open
do
you
want
me
sir
asked
chettle
eyeing
the
parcel
with
evident
desire
to
know
what
mystery
it
concealed
no
you
go
with
blindway
answered
the
chief
he
tell
you
happened
i
must
join
allerdyke
and
appleyard
then
we
come
over
to
you
do
take
any
notice
of
us
the
four
detectives
went
off
into
hyde
park
and
there
separated
in
couples
the
chief
turned
and
went
along
the
straight
path
which
runs
parallel
with
bayswater
road
just
within
the
shrubberies
of
kensington
gardens
presently
he
caught
sight
of
allerdyke
and
appleyard
who
occupied
two
chairs
under
a
shady
hawthorn
tree
and
he
laid
hold
of
another
dragged
it
to
them
and
sat
down
each
looked
a
silent
inquiry
and
the
chief
with
a
smile
held
up
the
parcel
chettle
and
i
he
said
have
in
the
presence
of
the
manager
and
manageress
of
the
pompadour
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
room
and
the
belongings
of
the
young
lady
who
resides
there
under
the
name
of
miss
slade
there
is
not
a
jot
or
tittle
of
anything
there
to
show
that
she
is
also
marlow
except
one
thing
that
allerdyke
is
the
photograph
of
your
cousin
james
which
is
hanging
in
a
neat
silver
frame
over
her
mantelpiece
what
do
you
think
of
that
gentlemen
odd
said
appleyard
after
a
moment
reflective
silence
very
queer
said
allerdyke
frowning
very
queer
indeed
considering
queer
and
odd
assented
the
chief
as
to
considering
well
i
quite
know
what
it
is
that
we
are
considering
if
miss
slade
alias
marlow
is
a
member
of
the
gang
if
there
is
one
which
killed
and
robbed
james
allerdyke
it
a
decidedly
odd
and
queer
thing
that
she
should
frame
the
victim
portrait
and
hang
it
where
she
see
it
last
thing
at
night
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
most
extraordinary
and
it
made
me
think
a
good
deal
i
believe
you
once
said
allerdyke
that
your
cousin
was
a
bit
of
a
ladies
man
bit
that
way
inclined
was
james
replied
allerdyke
laconically
yes
he
fancied
the
ladies
a
bit
no
doubt
in
quite
a
proper
way
you
know
liked
their
society
and
so
on
just
so
assented
the
chief
well
i
wonder
if
he
and
miss
slade
alias
marlow
knew
each
other
at
all
outside
business
but
it
not
much
use
to
speculate
on
that
just
now
we
more
urgent
matters
to
attend
to
and
first
this
he
had
put
a
copy
of
a
morning
newspaper
round
the
small
brown
paper
parcel
and
now
took
it
off
and
showed
the
parcel
itself
to
the
two
wondering
men
one
of
them
at
any
rate
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
brown
paper
sealed
with
black
wax
said
allerdyke
remembering
what
chettle
had
told
him
good
lord
what
i
do
suppose
this
is
the
original
brown
paper
nor
these
the
original
dabs
of
black
wax
remarked
the
chief
as
he
produced
a
pocket
but
this
parcel
gentlemen
was
recently
confided
by
miss
slade
to
the
care
of
the
manageress
of
the
pompadour
to
be
put
in
the
hotel
safe
from
which
it
was
produced
to
me
twenty
minutes
ago
and
i
am
now
going
to
see
what
it
contains
the
others
sat
in
absorbed
silence
while
the
chief
delicately
removed
the
wrappings
of
the
mysterious
parcel
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
a
sheet
of
cartridge
paper
beneath
it
and
within
these
very
ordinary
envelopings
an
old
loosely
tied
about
with
a
bit
of
knotted
string
now
for
it
said
the
chief
the
box
contains
he
raised
the
lid
as
the
other
two
leaned
nearer
a
stray
ray
of
sunlight
filtering
through
the
swaying
boughs
of
the
hawthorn
shot
down
on
the
box
as
the
chief
lifted
a
wad
of
soft
paper
and
revealed
a
glittering
mass
of
pearls
and
diamonds
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
said
the
chief
softly
just
what
i
expected
ever
since
the
manageress
gave
me
this
parcel
this
of
course
is
the
parcel
which
your
cousin
sent
that
night
from
hull
allerdyke
it
fell
into
marlow
hands
alias
miss
slade
and
here
it
is
that
all
right
the
other
two
men
stared
at
the
contents
of
the
then
at
the
chief
then
at
each
other
a
deep
silence
had
fallen
it
was
some
minutes
before
allerdyke
broke
it
all
wrong
i
should
say
he
muttered
however
if
those
are
the
things
i
only
say
if
mind
i
suppose
we
a
step
nearer
to
something
else
but
what
the
chief
who
appeared
to
both
of
them
to
be
strangely
phlegmatic
about
the
whole
affair
proceeded
to
close
the
box
it
in
its
wrappings
and
tie
it
about
with
the
original
string
we
are
certainly
a
step
nearer
to
a
good
deal
he
said
making
a
neat
job
of
his
parcel
and
patting
it
affectionately
as
if
he
had
been
a
milliner
apprentice
doing
up
a
choice
confection
and
the
next
thing
we
do
is
to
take
a
walk
together
into
hyde
park
on
the
way
i
will
tell
you
why
we
are
going
there
that
is
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
of
the
reason
for
such
an
expedition
it
is
much
but
it
has
certain
possibilities
the
two
listened
with
great
curiosity
as
they
marched
across
the
grass
towards
the
each
possessed
the
love
of
the
mysterious
and
the
bizarre
this
last
development
tickled
their
fancy
and
stirred
their
imagination
what
on
earth
d
make
out
of
it
all
asked
allerdyke
gad
more
like
a
children
game
of
in
an
old
house
of
nooks
and
corners
than
what
i
should
have
imagined
police
proceedings
would
be
what
say
you
ambler
i
do
know
how
much
romance
and
adventure
there
usually
are
in
police
proceedings
replied
appleyard
cautiously
a
good
answer
appleyard
said
the
chief
laughing
ah
there
a
lot
more
of
both
than
civilians
would
think
in
addition
to
all
the
sordid
and
dismal
details
what
do
i
make
out
of
it
appleyard
why
i
think
somebody
has
all
this
time
been
making
a
special
investigation
of
this
mystery
for
himself
and
that
at
last
he
going
to
wind
it
up
with
a
sensational
revelation
to
us
do
you
be
surprised
if
you
an
application
for
that
fifty
thousand
pound
reward
before
you
really
think
that
exclaimed
allerdyke
incredulously
i
should
be
surprised
answered
the
chief
something
considerable
is
certainly
at
hand
now
let
us
settle
our
plan
of
campaign
this
i
remember
is
a
biggish
place
we
will
sit
down
at
one
of
the
tables
we
will
appear
to
be
three
quiet
gentlemen
disposed
to
take
a
cup
of
coffee
with
our
cigars
or
cigarettes
we
will
be
absorbed
in
our
own
conversation
and
company
but
at
the
same
time
we
will
look
about
us
therefore
use
your
eyes
gentlemen
as
much
as
you
like
but
appear
to
take
any
particular
interest
in
anything
you
see
and
openly
recognize
any
person
you
set
eyes
on
it
was
a
very
warm
and
day
and
the
lawns
around
the
were
filled
with
people
young
and
old
some
were
drinking
tea
some
coffee
some
were
indulging
in
iced
drinks
nursemaids
and
children
were
much
in
evidence
under
the
surrounding
trees
waitresses
were
flitting
about
hither
and
thither
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
that
this
eminently
london
park
scene
was
likely
to
prove
the
setting
of
the
last
act
of
a
drama
you
much
more
likely
to
see
and
to
recognize
than
we
are
remarked
allerdyke
as
the
three
gathered
round
a
table
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
for
my
part
i
see
nothing
but
men
women
and
children
except
that
i
also
see
chettle
sitting
across
yonder
with
another
man
who
no
doubt
one
of
your
lot
just
so
assented
the
chief
he
gave
an
order
for
coffee
to
a
passing
waitress
lighted
a
cigar
which
allerdyke
offered
him
and
glanced
round
as
if
he
were
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
just
so
well
i
see
my
own
four
men
i
also
see
at
least
six
detectives
who
belong
to
the
city
police
and
there
may
be
more
but
i
know
those
six
personally
they
are
spread
about
all
over
the
place
and
i
daresay
that
every
man
is
very
much
on
the
stretch
innocent
enough
as
he
looks
six
exclaimed
appleyard
and
four
of
yours
that
looks
as
if
they
expected
to
have
to
tackle
a
small
army
you
never
know
what
you
may
have
to
tackle
in
affairs
like
this
replied
the
chief
nothing
like
having
reserves
in
hand
you
know
now
let
me
give
you
a
tip
it
is
almost
exactly
two
never
mind
the
people
who
are
already
here
gentlemen
keep
your
eyes
open
on
any
look
out
quietly
for
folk
who
seem
to
drop
in
as
casually
as
we
do
look
for
example
at
those
two
men
who
are
coming
across
the
sward
there
swinging
their
sticks
they
allerdyke
suddenly
bent
his
head
towards
the
table
careful
he
said
gad
i
know
one
of
anyhow
van
koon
as
i
live
chapter
xxxii
the
chilverton
the
chief
allowed
himself
to
take
a
quick
searching
glance
at
the
two
men
he
had
indicated
he
had
already
heard
of
van
koon
and
of
his
sudden
disappearance
from
the
hotel
after
the
chance
encounter
with
chilverton
and
he
now
regarded
him
with
professional
interest
the
tall
man
you
mean
he
asked
just
so
answered
allerdyke
the
other
man
i
do
know
but
van
koon
what
he
here
for
now
is
he
in
this
after
all
the
chief
made
no
reply
he
was
furtively
watching
the
two
men
who
had
dropped
into
chairs
at
a
vacant
table
beneath
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
were
talking
to
a
waitress
having
taken
a
good
look
at
van
koon
he
turned
his
attention
to
van
koon
companion
a
little
dapper
man
smartly
dressed
in
bright
blue
serge
and
finished
off
with
great
care
in
all
his
appointments
he
seemed
to
be
approaching
middle
age
there
were
faint
traces
of
grey
in
his
pointed
beard
and
moustaches
he
carried
his
years
however
in
very
jaunty
fashion
and
his
white
homburg
hat
ornamented
with
a
blue
ribbon
was
set
at
a
rakish
angle
on
the
side
of
his
head
in
his
right
eye
he
wore
a
monocle
just
then
he
was
bringing
it
to
bear
on
the
waitress
who
stood
between
himself
and
his
companion
you
do
know
the
other
man
either
of
you
asked
the
chief
suddenly
allerdyke
shook
his
head
but
appleyard
nodded
i
know
that
chap
by
sight
he
said
i
seen
him
in
the
city
about
threadneedle
street
two
or
three
times
of
late
he
always
very
smartly
dressed
i
took
him
for
a
foreigner
of
some
sort
the
chief
turned
to
his
coffee
well
never
mind
him
he
said
pay
no
attention
so
long
as
that
man
is
van
koon
i
watch
him
quietly
but
you
may
be
sure
he
has
come
here
on
the
same
business
that
has
brought
us
here
i
allerdyke
whose
sharp
eyes
were
perpetually
moving
round
the
crowded
enclosure
and
the
little
groups
which
mingled
outside
it
suddenly
nudged
the
chief
elbow
miss
slade
he
whispered
and
rayner
appleyard
had
caught
sight
of
his
two
fellow
inmates
of
the
pompadour
at
the
very
moment
in
which
allerdyke
espied
them
he
slightly
turned
away
and
bent
his
head
allerdyke
followed
his
example
you
ca
mistake
them
he
said
to
the
chief
i
described
the
man
to
you
a
hunchback
they
crossing
through
the
crowd
towards
the
door
and
they
gone
in
there
replied
the
chief
in
another
minute
um
this
is
getting
more
mysterious
than
ever
i
wish
i
could
get
a
word
with
some
of
our
men
who
really
know
something
it
seems
to
me
but
at
that
moment
blindway
came
strolling
along
his
nose
in
the
air
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
outside
the
park
and
he
quietly
dropped
a
twisted
scrap
of
paper
at
his
superior
feet
as
he
passed
the
chief
picked
it
up
spread
it
out
on
the
table
and
read
its
message
aloud
to
his
companions
city
men
say
the
informant
is
here
and
will
indicate
the
men
to
be
arrested
in
a
few
minutes
the
chief
tore
the
scrap
of
paper
into
minute
shreds
and
dropped
them
on
the
grass
things
are
almost
at
the
crisis
he
murmured
with
a
smile
it
seems
that
we
gentlemen
are
to
play
the
part
of
spectators
the
next
thing
to
turn
up
is
fullaway
suddenly
exclaimed
allerdyke
thrown
off
his
guard
and
speaking
aloud
and
by
gad
he
got
that
man
chilverton
with
him
this
by
the
lord
harry
he
caught
sight
of
us
too
fullaway
was
coming
quickly
up
the
lawn
from
the
direction
of
the
serpentine
he
looked
unusually
alert
vigorous
and
bustling
by
his
side
hurrying
to
keep
pace
with
him
was
the
new
york
detective
and
fullaway
keen
eyes
roving
about
fell
on
allerdyke
and
the
chief
and
he
made
through
the
crowd
in
their
direction
beckoning
chilverton
to
follow
hullo
hullo
he
exclaimed
clapping
a
hand
on
allerdyke
shoulder
nodding
to
the
chief
and
staring
inquisitively
at
appleyard
so
here
too
eh
allerdyke
it
was
you
who
sent
me
that
mysterious
message
was
it
what
message
growled
allerdyke
be
careful
do
attract
attention
there
are
things
going
on
here
i
promise
you
drop
into
that
chair
man
tell
chilverton
to
sit
down
what
message
are
you
talking
about
fullaway
quick
to
grasp
the
situation
sat
down
in
a
chair
which
appleyard
pulled
forward
and
motioned
his
companion
to
follow
his
example
i
got
a
queer
message
typewritten
on
a
sheet
of
notepaper
which
bore
no
address
about
an
hour
ago
he
said
it
told
me
that
if
i
came
here
to
this
hyde
park
at
two
i
have
this
confounded
mystery
explained
no
signature
nothing
to
show
who
or
where
it
came
from
so
i
set
out
and
just
as
i
was
stepping
into
a
taxi
to
come
on
here
i
met
chilverton
so
he
came
along
with
me
what
brings
you
then
similar
message
eh
and
what
hush
whispered
appleyard
miss
slade
coming
out
of
the
and
who
the
man
that
with
her
all
five
men
glanced
covertly
over
their
shoulders
at
the
open
door
of
the
some
twenty
to
thirty
yards
away
down
its
steps
came
miss
slade
accompanied
by
a
man
whom
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
before
a
man
certainly
not
an
englishman
but
very
evidently
of
teutonic
extraction
who
was
talking
volubly
to
his
companion
and
making
free
use
of
his
hands
to
point
or
illustrate
his
conversation
and
when
he
saw
this
man
the
chief
turned
quickly
to
allerdyke
and
intercepted
a
look
which
allerdyke
was
about
to
give
him
the
same
thought
occurred
to
both
here
was
the
man
described
by
the
of
eastbourne
terrace
and
the
shabby
establishment
away
in
the
docks
miss
slade
exclaimed
fullaway
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
that
my
secretary
mar
sh
interrupted
the
chief
that
one
of
your
surprises
fullaway
quiet
now
quiet
our
job
is
to
watch
something
happen
in
a
minute
miss
slade
and
her
talkative
companion
edged
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
passed
out
to
an
open
patch
of
grass
whereon
a
few
children
were
playing
and
as
they
went
two
or
three
men
also
separated
themselves
from
the
idlers
around
the
tables
and
strolled
quietly
and
casually
in
the
same
direction
also
van
koon
and
the
man
with
him
left
their
table
and
as
if
they
had
no
object
in
life
but
mere
aimless
chatter
and
saunter
wandered
away
towards
the
couple
who
had
first
emerged
from
the
enclosure
and
thereupon
fullaway
not
to
be
repressed
burst
out
with
another
exclamation
my
god
chilverton
he
cried
there
is
van
koon
and
by
all
wonderful
merrifield
with
him
now
what
the
new
york
detective
who
was
under
no
orders
and
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
restrain
himself
wasted
no
time
in
words
like
a
flash
he
had
leapt
from
his
chair
threaded
his
way
through
the
surrounding
people
and
was
after
his
quarry
and
with
a
muttered
exclamation
of
anger
the
chief
rose
and
followed
and
it
seemed
to
allerdyke
that
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
score
of
men
up
to
that
moment
innocently
idling
and
lounging
rose
in
company
damn
it
he
growled
as
he
and
appleyard
got
up
that
chap
going
to
spoil
everything
what
is
he
after
confound
you
fullaway
why
you
keep
quiet
for
a
minute
look
there
van
koon
had
turned
and
seen
chilverton
so
too
had
van
companion
so
also
had
miss
slade
and
the
man
she
was
walking
with
that
man
too
saw
the
apparent
idlers
closing
in
upon
him
for
a
second
he
and
van
koon
and
the
other
man
stared
at
each
other
across
the
grass
then
as
with
a
common
instinct
each
turned
to
flee
and
at
that
instant
miss
slade
with
a
truly
feminine
cry
threw
herself
upon
her
companion
and
got
an
undeniably
firm
grip
on
his
struggling
arms
this
is
the
eastbourne
terrace
man
she
panted
as
allerdyke
and
detectives
relieved
her
get
the
other
two
van
koon
and
merrifield
quick
but
van
koon
was
already
in
the
secure
grip
of
chilverton
and
the
person
in
the
light
blue
suit
was
being
safely
rounded
up
by
a
posse
of
men
chapter
xxxiii
the
smart
miss
slade
in
no
city
of
the
world
is
a
crowd
so
quickly
collected
as
in
london
in
none
is
one
so
easily
satisfied
and
dispersed
within
five
minutes
the
detectives
had
hurried
their
three
captives
away
towards
the
nearest
and
the
people
who
had
left
their
tea
and
their
cakes
to
gather
round
to
stare
and
to
listen
had
gone
back
to
their
tables
to
discuss
this
latest
excitement
but
the
chief
and
allerdyke
fullaway
and
appleyard
miss
slade
and
rayner
stood
in
a
little
group
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
each
other
eventually
all
looks
except
rayner
centred
on
miss
slade
who
somewhat
out
of
breath
from
her
tussle
was
settling
her
hat
and
otherwise
composing
herself
and
it
was
miss
slade
who
spoke
first
when
the
party
as
a
party
found
itself
capable
of
speech
i
do
know
who
it
was
observed
miss
slade
rather
more
than
a
little
acidly
who
came
interfering
in
my
business
but
whoever
he
was
he
nearly
spoilt
it
she
darted
a
look
at
the
chief
who
hastened
to
exculpate
himself
not
i
he
said
with
a
smile
so
do
blame
me
miss
slade
i
was
merely
a
a
passive
spectator
until
the
right
moment
arrived
do
i
gather
that
the
right
moment
had
not
actually
arrived
for
your
purpose
you
do
answered
miss
slade
it
had
if
you
had
all
waited
a
few
moments
you
would
have
had
all
three
men
in
conference
round
one
of
those
tables
and
they
could
have
been
taken
with
far
less
fuss
and
bother
and
far
less
danger
to
me
it
the
greatest
wonder
in
the
world
that
i
not
lying
dead
on
that
grass
we
are
devoutly
thankful
that
you
are
not
said
the
chief
fervently
but
you
not
and
the
main
thing
is
that
the
three
men
are
in
custody
and
as
for
interference
it
was
chilverton
interrupted
fullaway
who
had
been
staring
at
his
mysterious
secretary
as
if
she
were
some
rare
object
which
he
had
never
seen
before
chilverton
all
chilverton
fault
as
soon
as
he
set
eyes
on
van
koon
nothing
would
hold
him
and
what
i
want
to
know
we
all
want
to
know
a
good
deal
remarked
the
chief
glancing
invitingly
at
miss
slade
miss
slade
has
no
doubt
a
good
deal
to
tell
i
suggest
that
we
walk
across
to
those
very
convenient
chairs
which
i
see
over
there
by
the
shrubbery
then
perhaps
i
want
to
know
a
good
deal
too
said
miss
slade
i
do
know
who
you
are
to
start
with
and
i
do
know
why
appleyard
happens
to
be
here
to
end
with
appleyard
answered
these
two
questions
readily
i
here
because
i
happen
to
be
allerdyke
london
representative
he
said
this
gentleman
is
a
very
highly
placed
official
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
miss
slade
having
composed
herself
favoured
the
chief
with
a
deliberate
inspection
oh
in
that
case
she
remarked
in
that
case
i
suppose
i
had
better
satisfy
your
curiosity
that
is
she
continued
turning
to
rayner
if
rayner
thinks
i
may
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
answered
rayner
let
sit
down
and
tell
them
all
about
it
the
party
of
six
went
across
to
the
quiet
spot
which
the
chief
had
indicated
and
fullaway
and
appleyard
obligingly
arranged
the
chairs
in
a
group
seated
in
the
midst
and
quite
conscious
that
she
was
the
centre
of
attraction
in
several
ways
miss
slade
began
her
explanation
of
the
events
and
mysteries
which
had
culminated
in
the
recent
sensational
event
i
daresay
she
said
looking
round
her
that
some
of
you
know
a
great
deal
more
about
this
affair
than
i
do
what
i
do
know
however
is
this
the
three
men
who
have
just
been
removed
are
without
doubt
the
of
the
combination
which
robbed
miss
lennard
attempted
to
rob
james
allerdyke
possibly
murdered
james
allerdyke
and
certainly
murdered
lydenberg
lisette
beaurepaire
and
ebers
van
koon
is
an
american
crook
whose
real
name
is
vankin
merrifield
as
you
know
is
delkin
secretary
the
other
man
is
one
otto
schmall
a
german
chemist
and
a
most
remarkably
clever
person
who
has
a
shop
and
a
chemical
manufactory
in
whitechapel
he
an
expert
in
poison
and
i
think
you
will
have
some
interesting
matters
to
deal
with
when
you
come
to
tackle
his
share
well
that
plain
fact
and
now
you
want
to
know
how
i
and
rayner
found
all
this
out
chiefly
you
murmured
rayner
chiefly
you
you
had
better
let
your
minds
go
back
to
the
morning
of
the
may
last
continued
miss
slade
paying
no
apparent
heed
to
this
interruption
on
that
morning
i
arrived
at
fullaway
office
at
my
usual
time
ten
to
find
that
fullaway
had
departed
suddenly
earlier
in
the
morning
for
hull
i
at
once
guessed
why
he
had
gone
i
knew
that
james
allerdyke
in
charge
of
the
princess
nastirsevitch
jewels
was
to
have
landed
at
hull
the
night
before
and
i
concluded
that
fullaway
had
set
off
to
meet
him
but
fullaway
has
a
bad
habit
of
leaving
letters
and
telegrams
lying
about
for
any
one
to
see
and
within
a
few
minutes
i
found
on
his
desk
a
telegram
from
marshall
allerdyke
dispatched
early
that
morning
from
hull
saying
that
his
cousin
had
died
suddenly
during
the
night
that
of
course
definitely
explained
fullaway
departure
and
it
also
made
me
wonder
knowing
all
i
did
know
if
the
jewels
were
safe
this
i
repeat
was
about
ten
to
ten
about
twelve
of
that
morning
the
van
koon
whom
i
knew
as
a
resident
in
the
hotel
and
a
frequent
caller
on
fullaway
came
in
he
wanted
fullaway
to
cash
a
cheque
for
him
i
told
him
that
i
could
do
that
and
i
took
his
cheque
wrote
out
one
of
my
own
and
went
up
town
to
parr
bank
at
the
bottom
of
martin
lane
to
get
the
cash
for
him
van
koon
stayed
in
the
office
reading
a
bundle
of
american
newspapers
which
had
just
been
delivered
i
was
away
from
the
office
perhaps
forty
minutes
or
so
when
i
returned
he
was
still
there
i
gave
him
the
money
he
thanked
me
and
went
away
towards
the
end
of
that
afternoon
just
before
i
was
leaving
the
office
i
got
a
wire
from
fullaway
from
hull
it
was
quite
short
it
merely
informed
me
that
james
allerdyke
was
dead
under
mysterious
circumstances
and
that
the
nastirsevitch
property
was
missing
of
course
i
knew
what
that
meant
and
i
drew
my
own
conclusions
now
i
come
to
the
a
critical
day
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
during
the
morning
a
boy
came
into
the
office
he
said
that
on
the
previous
day
about
twelve
he
had
brought
a
small
parcel
there
addressed
to
fullaway
and
had
handed
it
to
a
gentleman
who
was
reading
newspapers
and
who
had
answered
when
inquired
of
as
fullaway
this
gentleman
who
of
course
was
van
koon
had
signed
for
the
parcel
by
scribbling
two
initials
in
the
proper
space
the
boy
who
said
he
was
new
to
his
job
told
me
that
the
clerk
at
the
parcels
office
objected
to
this
as
not
being
a
proper
signature
and
had
told
him
to
call
next
time
he
was
passing
and
get
the
thing
put
right
he
accordingly
handed
me
the
sheet
and
i
believing
that
this
was
some
small
parcel
which
van
koon
had
taken
in
signed
for
and
placed
somewhere
in
the
office
or
in
fullaway
private
room
signed
my
own
name
for
franklin
fullaway
over
the
penciled
initials
and
as
i
did
so
i
noticed
that
the
parcel
had
been
sent
from
hull
when
the
boy
had
gone
i
looked
for
that
parcel
i
could
not
find
it
anywhere
it
was
certainly
not
in
the
office
nor
in
any
of
the
rooms
of
fullaway
suite
i
was
half
minded
to
go
to
van
koon
and
ask
about
it
but
i
decided
that
i
would
i
thought
i
would
wait
until
fullaway
returned
but
all
the
time
i
was
wondering
what
parcel
it
could
be
that
was
sent
from
hull
and
certainly
dispatched
from
there
on
the
very
evening
before
fullaway
hurried
journey
nothing
happened
until
fullaway
came
back
then
a
lot
of
things
happened
all
at
once
there
was
the
news
he
brought
about
the
hull
affair
then
there
was
the
affair
of
the
french
maid
a
great
deal
got
into
the
newspapers
rayner
and
i
who
live
at
the
same
began
to
discuss
matters
i
heard
through
fullaway
that
there
was
likelihood
of
a
big
reward
and
i
determined
to
have
a
try
for
it
in
conjunction
with
rayner
and
so
i
kept
my
own
counsel
i
said
nothing
about
the
affair
of
the
parcel
fullaway
who
had
been
manifesting
signs
of
impatience
and
irritation
during
the
last
few
minutes
here
snapped
out
a
question
why
did
you
tell
me
at
once
about
the
parcel
he
demanded
it
was
your
duty
miss
slade
gave
her
employer
a
cool
glance
possibly
she
retorted
but
you
are
much
too
careless
to
be
entrusted
with
secrets
fullaway
i
knew
that
if
i
told
you
about
that
parcel
you
spoil
everything
at
once
i
wanted
to
do
things
my
own
way
i
took
my
own
way
and
it
come
out
all
right
for
everybody
now
do
you
or
anybody
interrupt
again
i
telling
it
all
in
order
fullaway
made
an
inarticulate
growling
protest
but
miss
slade
took
no
notice
and
continued
in
even
dispassionate
tones
as
if
she
had
been
explained
a
mathematical
problem
the
affair
prospered
the
princess
came
the
reward
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
was
offered
then
rayner
and
i
put
our
heads
together
more
seriously
much
of
course
depended
upon
me
as
i
was
on
the
spot
i
wanted
a
chance
to
get
into
van
koon
rooms
some
time
when
he
was
out
fortunately
the
chance
came
one
afternoon
when
van
koon
was
in
our
office
he
and
fullaway
settled
to
dine
out
together
and
go
to
the
theatre
afterwards
that
gave
me
my
opportunity
i
made
an
excuse
about
staying
late
at
fullaway
office
and
when
both
men
were
clear
away
i
let
myself
into
van
koon
room
i
already
made
preparations
for
that
and
proceeded
to
search
i
found
the
parcel
it
was
a
small
square
parcel
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
sealed
with
black
wax
it
had
been
opened
the
original
wrapper
put
on
again
and
the
seals
resealed
i
took
it
into
fullaway
rooms
and
opened
it
carefully
inside
i
found
a
small
and
in
it
the
princess
jewels
i
took
them
out
then
i
put
certain
articles
of
corresponding
weight
into
the
box
did
it
up
again
precisely
as
i
had
found
it
smeared
over
the
seals
with
more
black
wax
went
back
to
van
koon
room
with
it
and
placed
it
again
where
i
had
found
it
in
a
small
i
now
knew
of
course
that
james
allerdyke
had
sent
those
jewels
direct
to
fullaway
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
hull
and
that
they
had
fallen
by
sheer
accident
into
van
koon
hands
but
i
wanted
to
know
more
i
wanted
to
know
if
van
koon
had
any
connection
with
this
affair
and
if
when
he
saw
that
the
parcel
was
from
hull
he
had
immediately
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
might
be
from
james
allerdyke
and
might
contain
the
actual
valuables
fortunately
rayner
had
already
made
arrangements
with
a
noted
private
inquiry
agent
to
have
van
koon
most
carefully
and
closely
watched
and
the
very
day
after
i
found
and
took
possession
of
the
jewels
we
received
a
report
from
this
agent
that
van
koon
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
shop
and
manufactory
of
a
german
chemist
named
schmall
in
whitechapel
further
he
had
twice
come
away
from
it
after
lengthy
visits
in
company
with
a
man
whom
the
employees
had
tracked
to
the
hotel
cecil
and
whom
i
knew
from
their
description
to
be
merrifield
delkin
private
secretary
naturally
having
discovered
this
we
gave
instructions
for
a
keener
watch
than
ever
to
be
kept
on
both
these
men
but
the
name
of
the
german
chemist
gave
me
personally
a
new
and
most
important
clue
there
had
been
employed
at
the
waldorf
hotel
for
some
weeks
up
to
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
may
a
young
man
who
then
called
himself
ebers
he
acted
as
valet
to
several
residents
amongst
others
fullaway
he
was
often
in
and
out
of
fullaway
rooms
once
fullaway
being
out
and
i
having
nothing
to
do
i
was
cleaning
up
some
photographic
apparatus
which
i
had
there
this
man
ebers
came
in
with
some
clothes
of
fullaway
seeing
what
i
was
doing
he
got
talking
to
me
about
photography
saying
that
he
himself
was
an
amateur
he
recommended
to
me
certain
materials
and
things
of
that
sort
which
he
said
he
could
get
from
a
friend
of
his
a
chemist
who
was
an
enthusiastic
photographer
and
manufactured
chemicals
and
things
used
in
photography
i
gave
him
some
money
to
get
me
a
supply
of
things
and
he
brought
various
packets
and
parcels
to
me
two
or
three
days
later
each
packet
bore
the
name
of
otto
schmall
and
an
address
in
a
street
which
runs
off
mile
end
road
now
when
the
private
inquiry
agent
made
his
reports
to
rayner
and
myself
about
van
koon
and
told
us
where
he
had
been
tracked
to
more
than
once
i
of
course
remembered
the
name
of
schmall
and
rayner
and
i
began
to
put
certain
facts
together
they
were
these
ebers
had
easy
access
to
fullaway
room
at
all
hours
and
was
often
in
them
when
both
fullaway
and
i
were
out
fullaway
is
notoriously
careless
in
leaving
papers
and
documents
letters
and
telegrams
lying
around
ebers
had
abundant
opportunities
of
reading
lots
of
documents
relating
to
the
pinkie
pell
pearls
and
the
proposed
nastirsevitch
deal
ebers
was
a
friend
of
schmall
schmall
was
evidently
a
man
of
great
cleverness
in
chemistry
all
the
circumstances
of
james
allerdyke
death
and
of
lisette
beaurepaire
death
pointed
to
unusually
skillful
poisoning
who
was
better
able
to
engineer
that
than
a
clever
chemist
the
jewels
belonging
to
the
princess
nastirsevitch
had
undoubtedly
fallen
into
van
koon
hands
van
koon
was
a
friend
of
schmall
so
also
evidently
was
merrifield
now
merrifield
as
secretary
knew
of
the
proposed
deal
obviously
then
schmall
van
koon
and
merrifield
were
in
league
whether
ebers
was
also
in
league
or
was
a
catspaw
we
did
not
trouble
to
decide
but
there
was
another
fact
which
seemed
to
have
some
bearing
though
it
is
one
which
i
have
never
yet
worked
out
perhaps
some
of
you
know
something
of
it
it
was
this
just
before
he
went
to
russia
james
allerdyke
being
in
town
gave
me
a
photograph
of
himself
which
marshall
allerdyke
had
recently
taken
i
kept
that
photo
lying
on
my
desk
at
fullaway
for
some
time
one
day
i
missed
it
it
is
such
an
unusual
thing
for
me
to
misplace
anything
that
i
turned
over
every
paper
on
my
desk
in
searching
for
it
it
was
not
to
be
found
four
days
later
i
found
it
exactly
where
it
ought
to
have
been
now
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
from
that
mine
are
that
ebers
stole
it
so
that
he
could
reproduce
it
in
order
to
give
his
reproduction
to
some
person
who
wanted
to
identify
james
allerdyke
at
sight
however
to
go
forward
to
the
discovery
which
we
made
about
schmall
van
koon
and
merrifield
as
soon
as
we
made
that
discovery
rayner
was
for
going
to
the
police
at
once
but
i
thought
not
there
was
still
certain
evidence
which
i
wanted
so
that
the
case
could
be
presented
without
a
flaw
however
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
that
we
should
have
to
act
ebers
was
found
dead
in
a
small
hotel
near
the
docks
and
at
a
conference
in
which
fullaway
insisted
i
should
join
in
his
rooms
and
at
which
van
koon
who
had
been
playing
a
bluff
game
was
present
there
was
enough
said
to
convince
me
that
van
koon
and
his
associates
would
take
alarm
and
be
off
with
what
they
believed
themselves
to
possess
the
jewels
in
that
parcel
so
then
rayner
and
i
determined
on
big
measures
and
they
were
risky
ones
for
me
i
had
already
been
down
more
than
once
into
whitechapel
and
had
bought
things
at
schmall
shop
and
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
the
man
who
accompanied
lisette
beaurepaire
to
that
little
hotel
in
eastbourne
terrace
now
that
the
critical
moment
came
after
the
affair
i
went
there
again
i
got
schmall
outside
his
premises
i
took
a
bold
step
i
told
him
that
i
was
a
woman
detective
who
for
purposes
of
my
own
had
been
working
this
case
and
that
i
was
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
if
i
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
tell
him
this
in
the
thick
of
a
crowded
street
he
would
have
killed
me
on
the
spot
then
i
went
on
to
tell
him
more
i
said
that
his
accomplice
had
led
him
to
believe
that
he
had
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
in
a
parcel
in
his
possession
i
said
that
van
koon
was
wrong
i
had
them
myself
i
told
him
how
i
got
them
he
nearly
collapsed
at
that
i
restored
him
by
saying
that
the
real
object
of
my
visit
to
him
was
to
do
a
deal
with
him
i
said
that
it
did
not
matter
two
pins
to
me
what
he
and
his
accomplices
had
done
what
i
was
out
for
was
money
nothing
but
money
how
much
would
he
and
the
others
put
up
for
the
jewels
and
my
silence
i
reminded
him
of
the
fifty
thousand
pound
reward
he
glared
at
me
like
the
devil
he
is
and
said
that
he
a
mind
to
kill
me
there
and
then
whatever
happened
whereupon
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
revolver
in
my
jacket
pocket
that
it
was
trained
on
him
and
that
if
he
moved
my
finger
would
move
just
as
quick
and
i
invited
him
to
be
sensible
it
was
nothing
but
a
question
of
money
i
said
much
would
they
give
finally
we
settled
it
at
sixty
thousand
pounds
he
was
to
meet
me
here
at
two
the
other
two
were
to
be
about
the
money
was
to
be
paid
to
me
on
production
of
the
jewels
for
which
purpose
one
of
them
was
to
go
with
me
to
my
and
you
know
the
rest
miss
slade
came
to
a
sudden
stop
she
glanced
at
rayner
who
had
been
watching
the
effect
of
her
story
on
the
other
men
at
least
she
added
suddenly
you
know
all
that
really
important
as
ebers
affair
was
in
the
city
we
warned
the
city
police
and
left
things
with
them
i
think
that
all
except
of
course
marshall
allerdyke
that
we
formally
claim
the
reward
for
which
responsible
and
equally
of
course
that
rayner
and
i
will
hand
over
her
jewels
in
the
course
of
this
afternoon
to
the
princess
miss
lennard
property
i
should
say
you
find
hidden
away
on
premises
yes
that
all
except
this
said
the
chief
quietly
he
unwrapped
the
newspaper
in
which
he
had
carried
his
small
parcel
and
revealed
its
contents
to
miss
slade
the
jewels
you
see
miss
slade
are
here
it
has
been
my
painful
duty
to
visit
your
hotel
and
to
possess
myself
of
them
sorry
but
miss
slade
gave
one
glance
of
astonishment
at
the
chief
and
his
exhibit
then
she
laughed
in
his
face
do
apologize
and
do
trouble
yourself
she
said
suavely
but
you
a
bit
off
it
all
the
same
those
are
some
paste
things
which
rayner
got
together
for
me
in
case
it
came
to
being
obliged
to
exhibit
some
to
the
crooks
you
do
think
really
that
i
was
going
to
run
any
risks
with
the
genuine
articles
sakes
they
all
right
deposited
snug
and
safe
at
my
bankers
and
if
you
get
a
cab
drive
there
and
get
them
chapter
xxxiv
merrifield
explains
late
that
afternoon
marshall
allerdyke
and
fullaway
responding
to
an
urgent
telephone
call
went
to
new
scotland
yard
and
were
presently
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
great
man
who
had
been
so
much
in
evidence
that
day
the
great
man
was
as
as
suave
and
as
calmly
cheerful
as
ever
and
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
he
had
two
small
and
neatly
made
up
parcels
tied
and
sealed
in
obviously
official
fashion
so
we
seem
to
have
come
to
the
end
of
this
affair
gentlemen
he
observed
as
he
waved
his
visitors
to
chairs
on
either
side
of
him
except
of
course
for
the
unpleasant
consequences
which
must
necessarily
result
to
the
men
we
caught
however
there
will
be
no
consequences
of
that
sort
for
one
of
them
schmall
has
escaped
us
got
away
exclaimed
fullaway
great
scott
you
do
mean
that
schmall
committed
suicide
this
afternoon
replied
the
chief
calmly
clever
man
in
his
own
line
which
was
a
very
bad
line
he
was
searched
most
narrowly
and
carefully
so
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
carried
some
of
his
subtle
poison
in
his
mouth
the
hollow
tooth
dodge
no
doubt
anyway
he
dead
they
found
him
dead
in
his
cell
it
a
pity
for
he
richly
deserved
hanging
at
least
according
to
merrifield
ah
said
fullaway
with
a
start
according
to
merrifield
eh
now
what
may
that
mean
to
find
merrifield
in
this
at
all
was
of
course
a
regular
shock
to
me
merrifield
just
the
type
of
man
who
would
has
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
answered
the
chief
he
made
it
to
me
an
hour
ago
he
thought
it
best
he
wants
naturally
enough
to
save
his
neck
will
he
growled
allerdyke
a
lot
of
necks
ought
to
crack
after
all
this
ca
say
we
must
prejudge
the
case
said
the
chief
but
his
desire
of
course
he
would
tell
me
everything
at
once
i
had
it
all
taken
down
but
i
remember
every
scrap
of
it
you
want
to
hear
well
there
a
good
deal
of
it
but
i
can
epitomize
it
you
find
that
you
were
much
to
blame
fullaway
just
as
that
smart
young
woman
your
secretary
was
candid
enough
to
tell
you
oh
i
know
i
know
asserted
fullaway
but
this
confession
very
well
responded
the
chief
here
it
is
then
but
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
merrifield
could
only
tell
what
he
knew
there
probably
be
details
to
come
out
later
anyway
merrifield
whose
chief
object
is
i
must
also
remind
you
the
clearing
of
himself
from
any
charge
of
murder
he
does
mind
the
other
charge
but
he
does
object
to
the
graver
one
says
that
though
he
been
playing
it
straight
for
some
time
ever
since
he
went
into
delkin
service
in
fact
he
had
negotiations
of
a
questionable
sort
with
both
schmall
and
van
koon
before
years
ago
in
this
city
and
in
new
york
he
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
schmall
when
he
came
over
this
time
with
delkin
met
him
accidentally
and
got
going
it
with
him
again
and
they
both
resumed
dealings
with
van
koon
who
i
may
say
was
wanted
by
chilverton
on
a
quite
different
charge
schmall
had
set
up
a
business
here
in
the
east
end
as
a
small
manufacturing
chemist
he
evidently
a
perfect
and
a
diabolical
genius
for
chemistry
especially
in
secret
poisons
and
down
there
merrifield
and
van
koon
used
to
go
also
there
used
to
go
there
the
young
man
ebers
or
federman
we
stick
to
ebers
who
from
merrifield
account
seems
to
have
been
a
tool
of
schmall
ebers
a
fellow
of
evident
acute
perception
used
to
tell
schmall
of
things
which
his
calling
as
valet
at
various
hotels
gave
him
knowledge
it
strikes
me
that
from
what
we
now
know
we
shall
be
able
to
trace
to
schmall
and
ebers
several
robberies
at
hotels
which
have
puzzled
us
a
good
deal
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
ebers
who
told
schmall
of
the
two
matters
of
which
he
obtained
knowledge
when
he
used
to
frequent
your
rooms
fullaway
the
pearls
belonging
to
miss
lennard
and
the
proposed
jewel
deal
between
the
princess
nastirsevitch
and
delkin
but
in
that
last
merrifield
came
in
he
too
knew
of
it
and
he
told
schmall
and
van
koon
but
ebers
supplied
the
detailed
information
of
what
you
were
doing
through
access
as
miss
slade
said
to
your
papers
which
you
left
lying
about
you
know
i
know
i
know
groaned
fullaway
careless
careless
very
said
the
chief
with
a
smile
at
allerdyke
teach
you
a
lesson
perhaps
however
there
this
knowledge
was
now
schmall
according
to
merrifield
was
the
leading
spirit
he
had
the
man
lydenberg
in
his
employ
he
sent
him
off
to
christiania
to
waylay
james
allerdyke
he
supplied
him
with
a
photograph
of
james
allerdyke
which
ebers
procured
i
know
that
muttered
allerdyke
clever
too
exactly
agreed
the
chief
now
at
the
same
time
schmall
learned
of
miss
lennard
return
he
sent
ebers
who
already
knew
and
had
been
cultivating
the
french
maid
down
to
hull
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
away
with
miss
lennard
that
was
done
easily
the
lydenberg
affair
however
did
not
come
off
through
lydenberg
because
as
we
now
know
james
allerdyke
sent
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
off
to
you
fullaway
but
there
fortune
favoured
these
fellows
van
koon
for
purposes
of
theirs
had
taken
up
his
quarters
close
by
you
in
your
absence
the
box
came
into
his
hands
and
we
know
how
the
ingenious
miss
slade
despoiled
him
of
it
the
chief
paused
for
a
moment
and
mechanically
shifted
the
two
parcels
which
stood
before
him
he
seemed
to
be
reflecting
and
when
he
spoke
again
he
prefaced
his
words
with
a
shake
of
the
head
now
here
from
this
point
he
continued
i
do
know
if
merrifield
is
telling
the
truth
probably
he
is
but
i
confess
that
at
present
i
do
see
how
we
going
to
prove
that
he
is
he
strenuously
declares
that
neither
he
nor
van
koon
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
murder
of
lisette
beaurepaire
lydenberg
or
ebers
he
further
says
that
he
does
not
know
if
lydenberg
poisoned
james
allerdyke
he
declares
that
he
does
not
know
if
it
was
ever
intended
to
poison
james
allerdyke
though
he
confesses
that
it
was
intended
to
rob
him
at
hull
schmall
he
says
was
the
active
partner
in
all
this
he
took
all
that
into
his
own
hands
according
to
merrifield
he
does
not
know
nor
van
koon
either
if
it
was
schmall
who
went
down
to
hull
and
shot
lydenberg
or
if
lydenberg
was
murdered
by
some
person
who
had
a
commission
for
his
destruction
from
some
secret
society
lydenberg
he
believed
was
mixed
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
i
know
that
i
think
exclaimed
allerdyke
i
daresay
we
all
three
know
what
we
think
observed
the
chief
schmall
seems
to
have
had
a
genius
for
putting
his
tools
out
of
the
way
when
he
had
done
with
them
it
was
undoubtedly
schmall
who
took
lisette
beaurepaire
to
that
hotel
in
paddington
and
poisoned
her
it
was
just
as
undoubtedly
schmall
who
took
ebers
to
the
hotel
in
london
docks
and
got
rid
of
him
but
i
tell
you
merrifield
swears
that
neither
he
nor
van
koon
knew
of
these
things
and
did
not
connive
at
them
did
they
know
of
them
afterwards
asked
fullaway
ah
replied
the
chief
that
what
they
have
to
satisfy
a
judge
and
jury
about
i
think
they
find
it
difficult
but
that
about
all
except
this
that
they
were
all
three
about
to
clear
out
when
the
enterprising
miss
slade
turned
up
and
told
schmall
she
got
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
that
was
a
stiff
proposition
for
them
but
they
were
equal
to
it
for
you
see
miss
slade
let
him
know
that
she
was
open
to
do
a
deal
for
sixty
thousand
pounds
how
were
they
to
get
sixty
thousand
pounds
ah
now
came
a
confession
from
merrifield
which
has
already
for
i
told
him
of
it
made
delkin
stare
delkin
it
appears
keeps
a
very
big
banking
account
here
in
london
so
big
that
his
bankers
think
nothing
of
his
drawing
what
we
should
call
enormous
cash
cheques
now
merrifield
you
see
what
a
clean
breast
made
admitted
to
me
that
he
was
an
expert
forger
so
he
calmly
forged
a
cheque
of
delkin
drew
sixty
thousand
in
notes
and
they
had
them
on
them
at
least
merrifield
had
when
we
took
all
three
a
few
hours
ago
nice
people
eh
there
was
a
silence
of
much
significance
for
a
few
minutes
then
allerdyke
got
up
from
his
chair
with
a
growl
i
have
given
a
good
deal
if
that
fellow
schmall
had
saved
his
neck
for
the
gallows
he
muttered
he
cheated
me
it
my
impression
said
the
chief
that
if
miss
slade
had
been
so
smart
schmall
would
have
cheated
his
two
accomplices
he
had
what
he
believed
to
be
the
parcel
containing
the
nastirsevitch
jewels
in
his
possession
and
he
also
had
miss
lennard
pearls
locked
up
in
his
safe
we
got
those
this
afternoon
on
searching
his
premises
miss
slade
gave
us
the
real
nastirsevitch
jewels
from
her
bank
here
they
are
both
lots
in
these
parcels
and
if
you
two
gentlemen
will
go
through
the
formality
of
signing
receipts
for
them
you
fullaway
can
take
her
parcel
to
the
princess
and
you
allerdyke
can
carry
hers
to
miss
lennard
and
er
he
added
with
a
quiet
smile
as
he
rose
and
produced
some
papers
you
wo
mind
either
of
you
i
sure
if
a
couple
of
my
men
accompany
you
just
to
see
that
you
accomplish
your
respective
missions
in
safety
chapter
xxxv
the
allerdyke
way
with
the
recovered
pearls
in
his
hand
and
chettle
as
guardian
and
companion
at
his
side
allerdyke
chartered
a
and
demanded
to
be
driven
to
bedford
court
mansions
and
as
they
glided
away
up
whitehall
he
turned
to
the
detective
with
a
grin
that
had
a
sardonic
complexion
to
it
well
except
for
the
law
business
i
reckon
this
is
about
over
chettle
he
said
you
had
plenty
to
do
anyway
not
much
kicking
your
heels
in
idleness
anywhere
while
this
has
been
going
on
chettle
pulled
a
long
face
and
sighed
unfortunate
for
me
all
the
same
allerdyke
he
answered
meant
to
have
a
big
cut
in
at
that
reward
sir
now
i
suppose
that
young
woman
get
it
miss
slade
doubtless
get
most
of
it
replied
allerdyke
but
i
think
there
have
to
be
a
bit
of
a
like
you
fellows
are
certainly
entitled
to
some
of
it
especially
you
and
two
or
three
of
those
folks
who
gave
some
information
ought
to
have
a
look
in
but
of
course
miss
slade
will
feel
herself
entitled
to
the
big
lump
and
take
care
to
get
it
do
make
any
mistake
she
a
deal
too
clever
that
young
lady
observed
chettle
i
like
clever
but
not
quite
as
clever
as
all
that
in
my
opinion
mistaken
her
calling
has
that
young
woman
she
ought
to
have
been
one
of
us
they
uncommonly
bent
that
way
some
of
these
modern
misses
they
can
see
right
through
a
thing
sometimes
where
we
men
see
an
inch
above
our
noses
intuition
said
allerdyke
with
a
laugh
aye
well
perhaps
miss
slade
have
got
so
infected
with
enthusiasm
for
your
business
that
she
go
in
for
it
regularly
this
reward
do
for
capital
you
know
chettle
ah
responded
chettle
feelingly
wish
it
was
coming
to
me
i
would
put
no
capital
into
that
business
not
me
sir
i
have
a
nice
little
farm
in
the
country
and
i
grow
roses
and
breed
sheep
and
pigs
and
and
lose
all
your
brass
in
a
couple
of
years
laughed
allerdyke
stick
to
your
own
game
my
lad
and
when
you
want
to
grow
roses
do
it
in
your
own
back
yard
for
pleasure
and
here
we
are
and
you
best
wait
chettle
until
miss
lennard
herself
gives
a
receipt
for
this
stuff
and
then
you
can
take
it
back
to
scotland
yard
and
frame
it
he
left
chettle
in
an
of
