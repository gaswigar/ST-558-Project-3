preface
in
writing
this
book
my
intention
was
to
present
in
the
form
of
an
interesting
story
a
faithful
picture
of
life
more
especially
of
those
engaged
in
the
building
trades
in
a
small
town
in
the
south
of
england
i
wished
to
describe
the
relations
existing
between
the
workmen
and
their
employers
the
attitude
and
feelings
of
these
two
classes
towards
each
other
their
circumstances
when
at
work
and
when
out
of
employment
their
pleasures
their
intellectual
outlook
their
religious
and
political
opinions
and
ideals
the
action
of
the
story
covers
a
period
of
only
a
little
over
twelve
months
but
in
order
that
the
picture
might
be
complete
it
was
necessary
to
describe
how
the
workers
are
circumstanced
at
all
periods
of
their
lives
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
therefore
the
characters
include
women
and
children
a
young
boy
the
apprentice
some
improvers
journeymen
in
the
prime
of
life
and
old
men
i
designed
to
show
the
conditions
relating
from
poverty
and
unemployment
to
expose
the
futility
of
the
measures
taken
to
deal
with
them
and
to
indicate
what
i
believe
to
be
the
only
real
remedy
namely
socialism
i
intended
to
explain
what
socialists
understand
by
the
word
to
define
the
socialist
theory
of
the
causes
of
poverty
and
to
explain
how
socialists
propose
to
abolish
poverty
it
may
be
objected
that
considering
the
number
of
books
dealing
with
these
subjects
already
existing
such
a
work
as
this
was
uncalled
for
the
answer
is
that
not
only
are
the
majority
of
people
opposed
to
socialism
but
a
very
brief
conversation
with
an
average
is
sufficient
to
show
that
he
does
not
know
what
socialism
means
the
same
is
true
of
all
the
writers
and
the
statesmen
who
make
speeches
unless
we
believe
that
they
are
deliberate
liars
and
imposters
who
to
serve
their
own
interests
labour
to
mislead
other
people
we
must
conclude
that
they
do
not
understand
socialism
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
of
the
extraordinary
things
they
write
and
say
the
thing
they
cry
out
against
is
not
socialism
but
a
phantom
of
their
own
imagining
another
answer
is
that
philanthropists
is
not
a
treatise
or
essay
but
a
novel
my
main
object
was
to
write
a
readable
story
full
of
human
interest
and
based
on
the
happenings
of
everyday
life
the
subject
of
socialism
being
treated
incidentally
this
was
the
task
i
set
myself
to
what
extent
i
have
succeeded
is
for
others
to
say
but
whatever
their
verdict
the
work
possesses
at
least
one
merit
that
of
being
true
i
have
invented
nothing
there
are
no
scenes
or
incidents
in
the
story
that
i
have
not
either
witnessed
myself
or
had
conclusive
evidence
of
as
far
as
i
dared
i
let
the
characters
express
themselves
in
their
own
sort
of
language
and
consequently
some
passages
may
be
considered
objectionable
at
the
same
time
i
believe
that
because
it
is
true
the
book
is
not
without
its
humorous
side
the
scenes
and
characters
are
typical
of
every
town
in
the
south
of
england
and
they
will
be
readily
recognized
by
those
concerned
if
the
book
is
published
i
think
it
will
appeal
to
a
very
large
number
of
readers
because
it
is
true
it
will
probably
be
denounced
as
a
libel
on
the
working
classes
and
their
employers
and
upon
the
section
of
the
community
but
i
believe
it
will
be
acknowledged
as
true
by
most
of
those
who
are
compelled
to
spend
their
lives
amid
the
surroundings
it
describes
and
it
will
be
evident
that
no
attack
is
made
upon
sincere
religion
chapter
an
imperial
banquet
a

discussion
the
mysterious
stranger
britons
never
shall
be
slaves
the
house
was
named
cave
it
was
a
large
building
standing
in
about
an
acre
of
ground
and
situated
about
a
mile
outside
the
town
of
mugsborough
it
stood
back
nearly
two
hundred
yards
from
the
main
road
and
was
reached
by
means
of
a
or
lane
on
each
side
of
which
was
a
hedge
formed
of
hawthorn
trees
and
blackberry
bushes
this
house
had
been
unoccupied
for
many
years
and
it
was
now
being
altered
and
renovated
for
its
new
owner
by
the
firm
of
rushton
builders
and
decorators
there
were
altogether
about
men
working
there
carpenters
plumbers
plasterers
bricklayers
and
painters
besides
several
unskilled
labourers
new
floors
were
being
put
in
where
the
old
ones
were
decayed
and
upstairs
two
of
the
rooms
were
being
made
into
one
by
demolishing
the
parting
wall
and
substituting
an
iron
girder
some
of
the
window
frames
and
sashes
were
so
rotten
that
they
were
being
replaced
some
of
the
ceilings
and
walls
were
so
cracked
and
broken
that
they
had
to
be
replastered
openings
were
cut
through
walls
and
doors
were
being
put
where
no
doors
had
been
before
old
broken
chimney
pots
were
being
taken
down
and
new
ones
were
being
taken
up
and
fixed
in
their
places
all
the
old
whitewash
had
to
be
washed
off
the
ceilings
and
all
the
old
paper
had
to
be
scraped
off
the
walls
preparatory
to
the
house
being
repainted
and
decorated
the
air
was
full
of
the
sounds
of
hammering
and
sawing
the
ringing
of
trowels
the
rattle
of
pails
the
splashing
of
water
brushes
and
the
scraping
of
the
stripping
knives
used
by
those
who
were
removing
the
old
wallpaper
besides
being
full
of
these
the
air
was
heavily
laden
with
dust
and
disease
germs
powdered
mortar
lime
plaster
and
the
dirt
that
had
been
accumulating
within
the
old
house
for
years
in
brief
those
employed
there
might
be
said
to
be
living
in
a
tariff
reform
paradise
they
had
plenty
of
work
at
twelve
bob
crass
the
painters
foreman
blew
a
blast
upon
a
whistle
and
all
hands
assembled
in
the
kitchen
where
bert
the
apprentice
had
already
prepared
the
tea
which
was
ready
in
the
large
galvanized
iron
pail
that
he
had
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
pail
were
a
number
of
old
mugs
dilapidated
and
one
or
two
empty
condensed
milk
tins
each
man
on
the
paid
bert
threepence
a
week
for
the
tea
and
sugar
they
did
not
have
milk
and
although
they
had
tea
at
as
well
as
at
dinner
the
lad
was
generally
considered
to
be
making
a
fortune
two
pairs
of
steps
laid
parallel
on
their
sides
at
a
distance
of
about
eight
feet
from
each
other
with
a
plank
laid
across
in
front
of
the
fire
several
upturned
pails
and
the
drawers
belonging
to
the
dresser
formed
the
seating
accommodation
the
floor
of
the
room
was
covered
with
all
manner
of
debris
dust
dirt
fragments
of
old
mortar
and
plaster
a
sack
containing
cement
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
walls
and
a
bucket
containing
some
stale
whitewash
stood
in
one
corner
as
each
man
came
in
he
filled
his
cup
or
condensed
milk
tin
with
tea
from
the
steaming
pail
before
sitting
down
most
of
them
brought
their
food
in
little
wicker
baskets
which
they
held
on
their
laps
or
placed
on
the
floor
beside
them
at
first
there
was
no
attempt
at
conversation
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
sounds
of
eating
and
drinking
and
the
drizzling
of
the
bloater
which
easton
one
of
the
painters
was
toasting
on
the
end
of
a
pointed
stick
at
the
fire
do
think
much
of
this
bloody
tea
suddenly
remarked
sawkins
one
of
the
labourers
it
oughter
be
all
right
retorted
bert
been
bilin
ever
since
past
eleven
bert
white
was
a
weedy
boy
fifteen
years
of
age
and
about
four
feet
nine
inches
in
height
his
trousers
were
part
of
a
suit
that
he
had
once
worn
for
best
but
that
was
so
long
ago
that
they
had
become
too
small
for
him
fitting
rather
tightly
and
scarcely
reaching
the
top
of
his
patched
and
broken
boots
the
knees
and
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
of
his
trousers
had
been
patched
with
square
pieces
of
cloth
several
shades
darker
than
the
original
fabric
and
these
patches
were
now
all
in
rags
his
coat
was
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
and
hung
about
him
like
a
dirty
ragged
sack
he
was
a
pitiable
spectacle
of
neglect
and
wretchedness
as
he
sat
there
on
an
upturned
pail
eating
his
bread
and
cheese
with
fingers
that
like
his
clothing
were
grimed
with
paint
and
dirt
then
you
ca
have
put
enough
tea
in
or
else
you
bin
up
wot
was
left
yesterday
continued
sawkins
the
bloody
do
you
leave
the
boy
alone
said
harlow
another
painter
you
do
like
the
tea
you
need
drink
it
for
my
part
i
sick
of
listening
to
you
about
it
every
damn
day
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
i
need
drink
it
answered
sawkins
i
paid
my
share
an
i
got
a
right
to
express
an
opinion
it
my
belief
that
the
money
we
gives
is
spent
on
penny
always
got
one
in
hand
an
to
make
wot
tea
does
buy
last
collects
all
the
slops
wot
left
and
biles
it
up
day
after
day
i
do
said
bert
who
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
not
me
wot
buys
the
things
at
all
i
gives
the
money
i
gets
to
crass
and
buys
them
so
there
at
this
revelation
some
of
the
men
furtively
exchanged
significant
glances
and
crass
the
foreman
became
very
red
better
keep
your
bloody
thruppence
and
make
your
own
tea
after
this
week
he
said
addressing
sawkins
then
we
a
little
peace
at
you
need
ask
me
to
cook
no
bloaters
or
bacon
for
you
no
more
added
bert
tearfully
i
wo
do
it
sawkins
was
not
popular
with
any
of
the
others
when
about
twelve
months
previously
he
first
came
to
work
for
rushton
he
was
a
simple
labourer
but
since
then
he
had
up
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
trade
and
having
armed
himself
with
a
and
put
on
a
white
jacket
regarded
himself
as
a
fully
qualified
painter
the
others
did
not
perhaps
object
to
him
trying
to
better
his
condition
but
his
wages
fivepence
an
hour
were
twopence
an
hour
less
than
the
standard
rate
and
the
result
was
that
in
slack
times
often
a
better
workman
was
off
when
sawkins
was
kept
on
moreover
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
sneak
who
carried
tales
to
the
foreman
and
the
every
new
hand
who
was
taken
on
was
usually
warned
by
his
new
mates
to
let
the
b
r
sawkins
see
anything
the
unpleasant
silence
which
now
ensued
was
at
length
broken
by
one
of
the
men
who
told
a
dirty
story
and
in
the
laughter
and
applause
that
followed
the
incident
of
the
tea
was
forgotten
did
you
get
on
yesterday
asked
crass
addressing
bundy
the
plasterer
who
was
intently
studying
the
sporting
columns
of
the
daily
obscurer
luck
replied
bundy
gloomily
had
a
bob
each
way
on
stockwell
in
the
first
race
but
it
was
scratched
before
the
start
this
gave
rise
to
a
conversation
between
crass
bundy
and
one
or
two
others
concerning
the
chances
of
different
horses
in
the
races
it
was
friday
and
no
one
had
much
money
so
at
the
suggestion
of
bundy
a
syndicate
was
formed
each
member
contributing
threepence
for
the
purpose
of
backing
a
dead
certainty
given
by
the
renowned
captain
kiddem
of
the
obscurer
one
of
those
who
did
not
join
the
syndicate
was
frank
owen
who
was
as
usual
absorbed
in
a
newspaper
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
bit
of
a
crank
for
it
was
felt
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
about
a
man
who
took
no
interest
in
racing
or
football
and
was
always
talking
a
lot
of
rot
about
religion
and
politics
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
he
was
generally
admitted
to
be
an
exceptionally
good
workman
they
would
have
had
little
hesitation
about
thinking
that
he
was
mad
this
man
was
about
years
of
age
and
of
medium
height
but
so
slightly
built
that
he
appeared
taller
there
was
a
suggestion
of
refinement
in
his
face
but
his
complexion
was
ominously
clear
and
an
unnatural
colour
flushed
the
think
cheeks
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
justification
for
the
attitude
of
his
fellow
workmen
for
owen
held
the
most
unusual
and
unorthodox
opinions
on
the
subjects
mentioned
the
affairs
of
the
world
are
ordered
in
accordance
with
orthodox
opinions
if
anyone
did
not
think
in
accordance
with
these
he
soon
discovered
this
fact
for
himself
owen
saw
that
in
the
world
a
small
class
of
people
were
possessed
of
a
great
abundance
and
superfluity
of
the
things
that
are
produced
by
work
he
saw
also
that
a
very
great
number
in
fact
the
majority
of
the
people
lived
on
the
verge
of
want
and
that
a
smaller
but
still
very
large
number
lived
lives
of
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
while
a
yet
smaller
but
still
very
great
number
actually
died
of
hunger
or
maddened
by
privation
killed
themselves
and
their
children
in
order
to
put
a
period
to
their
misery
and
strangest
of
all
in
his
opinion
he
saw
that
people
who
enjoyed
abundance
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
were
the
people
who
did
nothing
and
that
the
others
who
lived
in
want
or
died
of
hunger
were
the
people
who
worked
and
seeing
all
this
he
thought
that
it
was
wrong
that
the
system
that
produced
such
results
was
rotten
and
should
be
altered
and
he
had
sought
out
and
eagerly
read
the
writings
of
those
who
thought
they
knew
how
it
might
be
done
it
was
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
of
these
subjects
that
his
fellow
workmen
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
probably
something
wrong
with
his
mind
when
all
the
members
of
the
syndicate
had
handed
over
their
contributions
bundy
went
out
to
arrange
matters
with
the
bookie
and
when
he
had
gone
easton
annexed
the
copy
of
the
obscurer
that
bundy
had
thrown
away
and
proceeded
to
laboriously
work
through
some
carefully
cooked
statistics
relating
to
free
trade
and
protection
bert
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
his
mouth
wide
open
was
devouring
the
contents
of
a
paper
called
the
chronicles
of
crime
ned
dawson
a
poor
devil
who
was
paid
fourpence
an
hour
for
acting
as
mate
or
labourer
to
bundy
or
the
bricklayers
or
anyone
else
who
wanted
him
lay
down
on
the
dirty
floor
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
with
his
coat
rolled
up
as
a
pillow
went
to
sleep
sawkins
with
the
same
intention
stretched
himself
at
full
length
on
the
dresser
another
who
took
no
part
in
the
syndicate
was
barrington
a
labourer
who
having
finished
his
dinner
placed
the
cup
he
brought
for
his
tea
back
into
his
dinner
basket
took
out
an
old
briar
pipe
which
he
slowly
filled
and
proceeded
to
smoke
in
silence
some
time
previously
the
firm
had
done
some
work
for
a
wealthy
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
country
some
distance
outside
mugsborough
this
gentleman
also
owned
some
property
in
the
town
and
it
was
commonly
reported
that
he
had
used
his
influence
with
rushton
to
induce
the
latter
to
give
barrington
employment
it
was
whispered
amongst
the
hands
that
the
young
man
was
a
distant
relative
of
the
gentleman
and
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
in
some
way
and
been
disowned
by
his
people
rushton
was
supposed
to
have
given
him
a
job
in
the
hope
of
currying
favour
with
his
wealthy
client
from
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
more
work
whatever
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
may
have
been
the
fact
remained
that
barrington
who
knew
nothing
of
the
work
except
what
he
had
learned
since
he
had
been
taken
on
was
employed
as
a
labourer
at
the
usual
wages
fivepence
per
hour
he
was
about
years
of
age
and
a
good
deal
taller
than
the
majority
of
the
others
being
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
and
slenderly
though
well
and
strongly
built
he
seemed
very
anxious
to
learn
all
that
he
could
about
the
trade
and
although
rather
reserved
in
his
manner
he
had
contrived
to
make
himself
fairly
popular
with
his
workmates
he
seldom
spoke
unless
to
answer
when
addressed
and
it
was
difficult
to
draw
him
into
conversation
at
as
on
the
present
occasion
he
generally
smoked
apparently
lost
in
thought
and
unconscious
of
his
surroundings
most
of
the
others
also
lit
their
pipes
and
a
desultory
conversation
ensued
the
gent
what
bought
this
any
relation
to
sweater
the
draper
asked
payne
the
carpenter
foreman
the
same
bloke
replied
crass
he
used
to
be
on
the
town
council
or
something
bin
on
the
council
for
years
returned
crass
on
it
now
mayor
this
year
bin
mayor
several
times
before
see
said
payne
reflectively
married
old
sister
did
you
know
who
i
mean
grinder
the
greengrocer
i
believe
he
did
said
crass
was
grinder
sister
chimed
in
old
jack
linden
was
niece
i
know
because
i
remember
working
in
their
just
after
they
was
married
about
ten
year
ago
yes
i
remember
now
said
payne
used
to
manage
one
of
grinder
branch
shops
did
she
replied
linden
remember
it
very
well
because
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
it
at
the
time
by
all
accounts
ole
sweater
used
to
be
a
regler
un
no
one
never
thought
as
he
ever
git
married
at
all
there
was
some
funny
yarns
about
several
young
women
what
used
to
work
for
him
this
important
matter
being
disposed
of
there
followed
a
brief
silence
which
was
presently
broken
by
harlow
name
to
call
a
ai
it
he
said
the
cave
i
wonder
what
made
give
it
a
name
like
that
calls
all
sorts
of
outlandish
names
nowadays
said
old
jack
linden
generally
some
sort
of
meaning
to
it
though
observed
payne
instance
if
a
bloke
backed
a
winner
and
made
a
pile
might
call
epsom
lodge
or
newmarket
villa
sometimes
there
a
hoak
tree
or
a
cherry
tree
in
the
garding
said
another
man
they
calls
it
hoak
lodge
or
cherry
cottage
there
a
cave
up
at
the
end
of
this
garden
said
harlow
with
a
grin
know
the
cesspool
what
the
drains
of
the
runs
into
praps
they
called
it
after
that
about
the
drains
said
old
jack
linden
when
the
laughter
produced
by
this
elegant
joke
had
ceased
about
the
drains
i
wonder
what
they
going
to
do
about
them
the
ai
fit
to
live
in
as
they
are
now
and
as
for
that
bloody
cesspool
it
ought
to
be
done
away
with
it
is
going
to
be
replied
crass
going
to
be
a
new
set
of
drains
altogether
carried
right
out
to
the
road
and
connected
with
the
main
crass
really
knew
no
more
about
what
was
going
to
be
done
in
this
matter
than
did
linden
but
he
felt
certain
that
this
course
would
be
adopted
he
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
enhancing
his
own
prestige
with
the
men
by
insinuating
that
he
was
in
the
confidence
of
the
firm
goin
to
cost
a
good
bit
said
linden
i
suppose
it
will
replied
crass
money
ai
no
object
to
old
sweater
got
tons
of
it
you
know
got
a
large
wholesale
business
in
london
and
shops
all
over
the
bloody
country
besides
the
one
got
easton
was
still
reading
the
obscurer
he
was
not
about
to
understand
exactly
what
the
compiler
of
the
figures
was
driving
at
probably
the
latter
never
intended
that
anyone
should
understand
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
growing
feeling
of
indignation
and
hatred
against
foreigners
of
every
description
who
were
ruining
this
country
and
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
about
time
we
did
something
to
protect
ourselves
still
it
was
a
very
difficult
question
to
tell
the
truth
he
himself
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
at
length
he
said
aloud
addressing
himself
to
crass
do
you
think
of
this
fissical
policy
bob
thought
much
about
it
replied
crass
do
never
worry
my
about
politics
better
left
alone
chimed
in
old
jack
linden
sagely
about
politics
generally
ends
up
with
a
bloody
row
an
does
no
good
to
nobody
at
this
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
from
several
of
the
others
most
of
them
were
averse
from
arguing
or
disputing
about
politics
if
two
or
three
men
of
similar
opinions
happened
to
be
together
they
might
discuss
such
things
in
a
friendly
and
superficial
way
but
in
a
mixed
company
it
was
better
left
alone
the
policy
emanated
from
the
tory
party
that
was
the
reason
why
some
of
them
were
strongly
in
favour
of
it
and
for
the
same
reason
others
were
opposed
to
it
some
of
them
were
under
the
delusion
that
they
were
conservatives
similarly
others
imagined
themselves
to
be
liberals
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
them
were
nothing
they
knew
as
much
about
the
public
affairs
of
their
own
country
as
they
did
of
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
planet
of
jupiter
easton
began
to
regret
that
he
had
broached
so
objectionable
a
subject
when
looking
up
from
his
paper
owen
said
the
fact
that
you
never
trouble
your
heads
about
politics
prevent
you
from
voting
at
election
times
no
one
answered
and
there
ensued
a
brief
silence
easton
however
in
spite
of
the
snub
he
had
received
could
not
refrain
from
talking
i
do
go
in
for
politics
much
either
but
if
what
in
this
paper
is
true
it
seems
to
me
as
we
oughter
take
some
interest
in
it
when
the
country
is
being
ruined
by
foreigners
you
going
to
believe
all
that
in
that
bloody
rag
you
want
some
salt
said
harlow
the
obscurer
was
a
tory
paper
and
harlow
was
a
member
of
the
local
liberal
club
harlow
remark
roused
crass
the
use
of
talkin
like
that
he
said
know
very
well
that
the
country
is
being
ruined
by
foreigners
just
go
to
a
shop
to
buy
something
look
round
the
place
an
you
see
that
more
than
the
damn
stuff
comes
from
abroad
they
able
to
sell
their
goods
because
they
do
to
pay
no
dooty
but
they
takes
care
to
put
dooties
on
our
goods
to
keep
out
of
their
countries
and
i
say
it
about
time
it
was
stopped
said
linden
who
always
agreed
with
crass
because
the
latter
being
in
charge
of
the
job
had
it
in
his
power
to
put
in
a
good
or
a
bad
word
for
a
man
to
the
boss
now
wot
i
call
common
sense
several
other
men
for
the
same
reason
as
linden
echoed
sentiments
but
owen
laughed
contemptuously
it
quite
true
that
we
gets
a
lot
of
stuff
from
foreign
countries
said
harlow
they
buys
more
from
us
than
we
do
from
them
you
think
you
know
a
of
a
lot
said
crass
much
more
did
they
buy
from
us
last
year
than
we
did
from
them
harlow
looked
foolish
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
was
not
much
wider
than
crass
he
mumbled
something
about
not
having
no
for
figures
and
offered
to
bring
full
particulars
next
day
wot
i
call
a
bloody
windbag
continued
crass
got
a
of
a
lot
to
say
but
wen
it
comes
to
the
point
you
do
know
nothin
even
in
mugsborough
chimed
in
sawkins
who
though
still
lying
on
the
dresser
had
been
awakened
by
the
shouting
overrun
with
nearly
all
the
waiters
and
the
cook
at
the
grand
hotel
where
we
was
working
last
month
is
foreigners
said
old
joe
philpot
tragically
then
thers
all
them
hitalian
horgin
grinders
an
the
blokes
wot
sells
chestnuts
wen
i
was
goin
last
night
i
see
a
lot
of
them
frenchies
hunions
an
a
little
wile
afterwards
i
met
two
more
of
comin
up
the
street
with
a
bear
notwithstanding
the
disquieting
nature
of
this
intelligence
owen
again
laughed
much
to
the
indignation
of
the
others
who
thought
it
was
a
very
serious
state
of
affairs
it
was
a
dam
shame
that
these
people
were
allowed
to
take
the
bread
out
of
english
people
mouths
they
ought
to
be
driven
into
the
bloody
sea
and
so
the
talk
continued
principally
carried
on
by
crass
and
those
who
agreed
with
him
none
of
them
really
understood
the
subject
not
one
of
them
had
ever
devoted
fifteen
consecutive
minutes
to
the
earnest
investigation
of
it
the
papers
they
read
were
filled
with
vague
and
alarming
accounts
of
the
quantities
of
foreign
merchandise
imported
into
this
country
the
enormous
number
of
aliens
constantly
arriving
and
their
destitute
conditions
how
they
lived
the
crimes
they
committed
and
the
injury
they
did
to
british
trade
these
were
the
seeds
which
cunningly
sown
in
their
minds
caused
to
grow
up
within
them
a
bitter
undiscriminating
hatred
of
foreigners
to
them
the
mysterious
thing
they
variously
called
the
policy
the
policy
or
the
question
was
a
great
crusade
the
country
was
in
a
hell
of
a
state
poverty
hunger
and
misery
in
a
hundred
forms
had
already
invaded
thousands
of
homes
and
stood
upon
the
thresholds
of
thousands
more
how
came
these
things
to
be
it
was
the
bloody
foreigner
therefore
down
with
the
foreigners
and
all
their
works
out
with
them
drive
them
b
s
into
the
bloody
sea
the
country
would
be
ruined
if
not
protected
in
some
way
this
friscal
fistical
fissical
or
whatever
the
hell
policy
it
was
called
was
protection
therefore
no
one
but
a
bloody
fool
could
hesitate
to
support
it
it
was
all
quite
plain
quite
simple
one
did
not
need
to
think
twice
about
it
it
was
scarcely
necessary
to
think
about
it
at
all
this
was
the
conclusion
reached
by
crass
and
such
of
his
mates
who
thought
they
were
conservatives
the
majority
of
them
could
not
have
read
a
dozen
sentences
aloud
without
stumbling
it
was
not
necessary
to
think
or
study
or
investigate
anything
it
was
all
as
clear
as
daylight
the
foreigner
was
the
enemy
and
the
cause
of
poverty
and
bad
trade
when
the
storm
had
in
some
degree
subsided
of
you
seem
to
think
said
owen
sneeringly
it
was
a
great
mistake
on
god
part
to
make
so
many
foreigners
you
ought
to
hold
a
mass
meeting
about
it
pass
a
resolution
something
like
this
this
meeting
of
british
christians
hereby
indignantly
protests
against
the
action
of
the
supreme
being
in
having
created
so
many
foreigners
and
calls
upon
him
to
forthwith
rain
down
fire
brimstone
and
mighty
rocks
upon
the
heads
of
all
those
philistines
so
that
they
may
be
utterly
exterminated
from
the
face
of
the
earth
which
rightly
belongs
to
the
british
people
crass
looked
very
indignant
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
in
answer
to
owen
who
continued
little
while
ago
you
made
the
remark
that
you
never
trouble
yourself
about
what
you
call
politics
and
some
of
the
rest
agreed
with
you
that
to
do
so
is
not
worth
while
well
since
you
never
worry
yourself
about
these
things
it
follows
that
you
know
nothing
about
them
yet
you
do
not
hesitate
to
express
the
most
decided
opinions
concerning
matters
of
which
you
admittedly
know
nothing
presently
when
there
is
an
election
you
will
go
and
vote
in
favour
of
a
policy
of
which
you
know
nothing
i
say
that
since
you
never
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
which
side
is
right
or
wrong
you
have
no
right
to
express
any
opinion
you
are
not
fit
to
vote
you
should
not
be
allowed
to
vote
crass
was
by
this
time
very
angry
pays
my
rates
and
taxes
he
shouted
i
got
as
much
right
to
express
an
opinion
as
you
i
votes
for
who
the
bloody
i
likes
i
sha
arst
your
leave
nor
nobody
else
wot
the
it
got
do
with
you
who
i
votes
for
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
me
if
you
vote
for
protection
you
will
be
helping
to
bring
it
about
and
if
you
succeed
and
if
protection
is
the
evil
that
some
people
say
is
is
i
shall
be
one
of
those
who
will
suffer
i
say
you
have
no
right
to
vote
for
a
policy
which
may
bring
suffering
upon
other
people
without
taking
the
trouble
to
find
out
whether
you
are
helping
to
make
things
better
or
worse
owen
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
emphasizing
his
words
with
excited
gestures
for
not
trying
to
find
out
wot
side
is
right
said
crass
somewhat
overawed
by
owen
manner

by
what
he
thought
was
the
glare
of
madness

the

eyes

i
generally

of
the
great
an
prosperity
wot
owen
makes
out
free
trade
brings
said
crass
with
a
jeering
laugh
never
said
free
trade
brought
happiness
or
prosperity
said
owen
praps
you
did
say
exactly
them
words
but
that
wot
it
amounts
to
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
we
had
free
trade
for
the
last
fifty
years
and
today
most
people
are
living
in
a
condition
of
more
or
less
abject
poverty
and
thousands
are
literally
starving
when
we
had
protection
things
were
worse
still
other
countries
have
protection
and
yet
many
of
their
people
are
glad
to
come
here
and
work
for
starvation
wages
the
only
difference
between
free
trade
and
protection
is
that
under
certain
circumstances
one
might
be
a
little
worse
that
the
other
but
as
remedies
for
poverty
neither
of
them
are
of
any
real
use
whatever
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
do
not
deal
with
the
real
causes
of
poverty
greatest
cause
of
poverty
is
remarked
harlow
said
old
joe
philpot
a
boss
wants
two
men
twenty
goes
after
the
job
ther
too
many
people
and
not
enough
work
cried
owen
there
thousands
of
acres
of
uncultivated
land
in
england
without
a
house
or
human
being
to
be
seen
is
the
cause
of
poverty
in
france
is
the
cause
of
poverty
in
ireland
within
the
last
fifty
years
the
population
of
ireland
has
been
reduced
by
more
than
half
four
millions
of
people
have
been
exterminated
by
famine
or
got
rid
of
by
emigration
but
they
have
got
rid
of
poverty
you
think
that
half
the
people
in
this
country
ought
to
be
exterminated
as
well
here
owen
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
and
resumed
his
seat
when
the
cough
had
ceased
he
sat
wiping
his
mouth
with
his
handkerchief
and
listening
to
the
talk
that
ensued
is
the
cause
of
most
of
the
poverty
said
slyme
this
young
man
had
been
through
some
strange
process
that
he
called
he
had
had
a
of
and
looked
down
with
pious
pity
upon
those
he
called
people
he
was
not
he
did
not
smoke
or
drink
and
never
went
to
the
theatre
he
had
an
extraordinary
notion
that
total
abstinence
was
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
christian
religion
it
never
occurred
to
what
he
called
his
mind
that
this
doctrine
is
an
insult
to
the
founder
of
christianity
said
crass
agreeing
with
slyme
thers
plenty
of
too
lazy
to
work
when
they
can
get
it
some
of
the
b
s
who
go
about
pleading
poverty
never
done
a
fair
day
work
in
all
their
bloody
lives
then
thers
all
this
machinery
continued
crass
wot
ruinin
everything
even
in
our
trade
ther
them
machines
for
trimmin
wallpaper
an
now
they
brought
out
a
machine
ther
a
pump
an
a
pipe
an
they
reckon
two
men
can
do
as
much
with
this
machine
as
twenty
could
without
it
thing
is
women
said
harlow
thousands
of
nowadays
doin
work
wot
oughter
be
done
by
men
my
opinion
ther
too
much
of
this
eddication
nowadays
remarked
old
linden
the
the
good
of
eddication
to
the
likes
of
us
whatever
said
crass
just
puts
foolish
idears
into
and
makes
too
lazy
to
work
barrington
who
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
still
sat
silently
smoking
owen
was
listening
to
this
pitiable
farrago
with
feelings
of
contempt
and
wonder
were
they
all
hopelessly
stupid
had
their
intelligence
never
developed
beyond
the
childhood
stage
or
was
he
mad
himself
marriages
is
another
thing
said
slyme
man
ought
to
be
allowed
to
get
married
unless
he
in
a
position
to
keep
a
family
can
marriage
be
a
cause
of
poverty
said
owen
contemptuously
man
who
is
not
married
is
living
an
unnatural
life
why
do
you
continue
your
argument
a
little
further
and
say
that
the
practice
of
eating
and
drinking
is
the
cause
of
poverty
or
that
if
people
were
to
go
barefoot
and
naked
there
would
be
no
poverty
the
man
who
is
so
poor
that
he
can
not
marry
is
in
a
condition
of
poverty
already
i
mean
said
slyme
that
no
man
ought
to
marry
till
saved
up
enough
so
as
to
some
money
in
the
bank
an
another
thing
i
reckon
a
man
ought
to
get
married
till
got
an
of
own
it
easy
enough
to
buy
one
in
a
building
society
if
in
work
at
this
there
was
a
general
laugh
you
bloody
fool
said
harlow
scornfully
of
us
is
about
our
time
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
you
got
almost
a
constant
job
on
this
firm
if
they
doin
anything
at
all
you
one
of
the
few
gets
a
show
in
and
another
thing
he
added
with
a
sneer
do
all
go
to
the
same
chapel
as
old
misery
misery
was
ruston
manager
or
walking
foreman
was
only
one
of
the
nicknames
bestowed
upon
him
by
the
hands
he
was
also
known
as
and
pilate
even
if
it
not
possible
harlow
continued
winking
at
the
others
a
man
to
do
during
the
years
he
savin
up
he
must
conquer
hisself
said
slyme
getting
red
hisself
is
right
said
harlow
and
the
others
laughed
again
course
if
a
man
tried
to
conquer
hisself
by
his
own
strength
replied
slyme
would
be
sure
to
fail
but
when
you
got
the
grace
of
god
in
you
it
different
it
fer
christ
sake
said
harlow
in
a
tone
of
disgust
only
just
our
dinner
wot
about
drink
demanded
old
joe
philpot
suddenly
cried
harlow
the
bleedin
talk
i
mind
a
pint
now
if
somebody
else
will
pay
for
it
joe
philpot
or
as
he
was
usually
called
joe
was
in
the
habit
of
indulging
freely
in
the
cup
that
inebriates
he
was
not
very
old
being
only
a
little
over
fifty
but
he
looked
much
older
he
had
lost
his
wife
some
five
years
ago
and
was
now
alone
in
the
world
for
his
three
children
had
died
in
their
infancy
slyme
reference
to
drink
had
roused
philpot
indignation
he
felt
that
it
was
directed
against
himself
the
muddled
condition
of
his
brain
did
not
permit
him
to
take
up
the
cudgels
in
his
own
behalf
but
he
knew
that
although
owen
was
a
himself
he
disliked
slyme
no
need
for
us
to
talk
about
drink
or
laziness
returned
owen
impatiently
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
the
question
is
what
is
the
cause
of
the
lifelong
poverty
of
the
majority
of
those
who
are
not
drunkards
and
who
do
work
why
if
all
the
drunkards
and
and
unskilled
or
inefficient
workers
could
be
by
some
miracle
transformed
into
sober
industrious
and
skilled
workers
tomorrow
it
would
under
the
present
conditions
be
so
much
the
worse
for
us
because
there
is
enough
work
for
all
now
and
those
people
by
increasing
the
competition
for
what
work
there
is
would
inevitably
cause
a
reduction
of
wages
and
a
greater
scarcity
of
employment
the
theories
that
drunkenness
laziness
or
inefficiency
are
the
causes
of
poverty
are
so
many
devices
invented
and
fostered
by
those
who
are
selfishly
interested
in
maintaining
the
present
states
of
affairs
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
us
from
discovering
the
real
causes
of
our
present
condition
if
we
all
wrong
said
crass
with
a
sneer
you
can
tell
us
what
the
real
cause
is
praps
you
think
you
know
how
it
to
be
altered
remarked
harlow
winking
at
the
others
i
do
think
i
know
the
cause
declared
owen
i
do
think
i
know
how
it
could
be
altered
ca
never
be
haltered
interrupted
old
linden
do
see
no
sense
in
all
this
talk
there
always
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
and
there
always
will
be
i
always
say
is
there
remarked
philpot
whose
principal
characteristic
apart
from
thirst
was
a
desire
to
see
everyone
comfortable
and
who
hated
rows
of
any
kind
ai
no
use
in
the
likes
of
us
trubblin
our
or
quarrelin
about
politics
it
do
make
a
dam
bit
of
difference
who
you
votes
for
or
who
gets
in
they
hall
the
same
workin
the
horicle
for
their
own
benefit
you
can
talk
till
you
black
in
the
face
but
you
wo
never
be
able
to
alter
it
it
no
use
worrying
the
sensible
thing
is
to
try
and
make
the
best
of
things
as
we
find
enjoy
ourselves
and
do
the
best
we
can
for
each
other
life
too
short
to
quarrel
and
we
hall
soon
be
dead
at
the
end
of
this
lengthy
speech
the
philosophic
philpot
abstractedly
grasped
a
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
but
suddenly
remembering
that
it
contained
stewed
tea
and
not
beer
set
it
down
again
without
drinking
us
begin
at
the
beginning
continued
owen
taking
no
notice
of
these
interruptions
of
all
what
do
you
mean
by
poverty
if
you
got
no
money
of
course
said
crass
impatiently
the
others
laughed
disdainfully
it
seemed
to
them
such
a
foolish
question
that
true
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
returned
owen
is
as
things
are
arranged
in
the
world
at
present
but
money
itself
is
not
wealth
it
of
no
use
whatever
at
this
there
was
another
outburst
of
jeering
laughter
for
example
that
you
and
harlow
were
shipwrecked
on
a
desolate
island
and
you
had
saved
nothing
from
the
wreck
but
a
bag
containing
a
thousand
sovereigns
and
he
had
a
tin
of
biscuits
and
a
bottle
of
water
it
beer
cried
harlow
appealingly
would
be
the
richer
man
you
or
harlow
then
you
see
we
ai
shipwrecked
on
no
dissolute
island
at
all
sneered
crass
the
worst
of
your
arguments
you
ca
never
get
very
far
without
supposing
some
bloody
ridclus
thing
or
other
never
mind
about
supposing
things
wot
ai
true
let
facts
and
common
sense
said
old
linden
wot
we
want
a
little
common
sense
do
you
mean
by
poverty
then
asked
easton
i
call
poverty
is
when
people
are
not
able
to
secure
for
themselves
all
the
benefits
of
civilization
the
necessaries
comforts
pleasures
and
refinements
of
life
leisure
books
theatres
pictures
music
holidays
travel
good
and
beautiful
homes
good
clothes
good
and
pleasant
food
everybody
laughed
it
was
so
ridiculous
the
idea
of
the
likes
of
them
wanting
or
having
such
things
any
doubts
that
any
of
them
had
entertained
as
to
owen
sanity
disappeared
the
man
was
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
a
man
is
only
able
to
provide
himself
and
his
family
with
the
bare
necessaries
of
existence
that
man
family
is
living
in
poverty
since
he
can
not
enjoy
the
advantages
of
civilization
he
might
just
as
well
be
a
savage
better
in
fact
for
a
savage
knows
nothing
of
what
he
is
deprived
what
we
call
civilization
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
our
forefathers
is
the
fruit
of
thousands
of
years
of
human
thought
and
toil
it
is
not
the
result
of
the
labour
of
the
ancestors
of
any
separate
class
of
people
who
exist
today
and
therefore
it
is
by
right
the
common
heritage
of
all
every
little
child
that
is
born
into
the
world
no
matter
whether
he
is
clever
or
full
whether
he
is
physically
perfect
or
lame
or
blind
no
matter
how
much
he
may
excel
or
fall
short
of
his
fellows
in
other
respects
in
one
thing
at
least
he
is
their
equal
he
is
one
of
the
heirs
of
all
the
ages
that
have
gone
before
some
of
them
began
to
wonder
whether
owen
was
not
sane
after
all
he
certainly
must
be
a
clever
sort
of
chap
to
be
able
to
talk
like
this
it
sounded
almost
like
something
out
of
a
book
and
most
of
them
could
not
understand
one
half
of
it
is
it
continued
owen
we
are
not
only
deprived
of
our
inheritance
we
are
not
only
deprived
of
nearly
all
the
benefits
of
civilization
but
we
and
our
children
are
also
often
unable
to
obtain
even
the
bare
necessaries
of
existence
no
one
answered
these
things
owen
proceeded
produced
by
those
who
work
we
do
our
full
share
of
the
work
therefore
we
should
have
a
full
share
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
the
others
continued
silent
harlow
thought
of
the
theory
but
decided
not
to
mention
it
crass
who
could
not
have
given
an
intelligent
answer
to
save
his
life
for
once
had
sufficient
sense
to
remain
silent
he
did
think
of
calling
out
the
patent
machine
and
bringing
the
hosepipe
to
bear
on
the
subject
but
abandoned
the
idea
after
all
he
thought
what
was
the
use
of
arguing
with
such
a
fool
as
owen
sawkins
pretended
to
be
asleep
philpot
however
had
suddenly
grown
very
serious
things
are
now
went
on
owen
of
enjoying
the
advantages
of
civilization
we
are
really
worse
off
than
slaves
for
if
we
were
slaves
our
owners
in
their
own
interest
would
see
to
it
that
we
always
had
food
and
i
do
see
that
roughly
interrupted
old
linden
who
had
been
listening
with
evident
anger
and
impatience
can
speak
for
yourself
but
i
can
tell
yer
i
do
put
myself
down
as
a
slave
me
neither
said
crass
sturdily
them
call
their
selves
slaves
as
wants
to
at
this
moment
a
footstep
was
heard
in
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
old
misery
or
perhaps
the
bloke
himself
crass
hurriedly
pulled
out
his
watch
christ
he
gasped
four
minutes
past
one
linden
frantically
seized
hold
of
a
pair
of
steps
and
began
wandering
about
the
room
with
them
sawkins
scrambled
hastily
to
his
feet
and
snatching
a
piece
of
sandpaper
from
the
pocket
of
his
apron
began
furiously
rubbing
down
the
scullery
door
easton
threw
down
the
copy
of
the
obscurer
and
scrambled
hastily
to
his
feet
the
boy
crammed
the
chronicles
of
crime
into
his
trousers
pocket
crass
rushed
over
to
the
bucket
and
began
stirring
up
the
stale
whitewash
it
contained
and
the
stench
which
it
gave
forth
was
simply
appalling
consternation
reigned
they
looked
like
a
gang
of
malefactors
suddenly
interrupted
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
the
door
opened
it
was
only
bundy
returning
from
his
mission
to
the
bookie
chapter
nimrod
a
mighty
hunter
before
the

mr
hunter
as
he
was
called
to
his
face
and
as
he
was
known
to
his
brethren
at
the
shining
light
chapel
where
he
was
superintendant
of
the
sunday
school
or
or
as
he
was
named
behind
his
back
by
the
workmen
over
whom
he
tyrannized

there
were
a
number
of

but
hunter
was
the
foreman
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
whose
clothes
hung
loosely
on
the
angles
of
his
bony
form
his
long
thin
legs
about
which
the
baggy
trousers
draped
in
ungraceful
folds
were
slightly
and
terminated
in
large
flat
feet
his
arms
were
very
long
even
for
such
a
tall
man
and
the
huge
bony
hands
were
gnarled
and
knotted
when
he
removed
his
bowler
hat
as
he
frequently
did
to
wipe
away
with
a
red
handkerchief
the
sweat
occasioned
by
furious
bicycle
riding
it
was
seen
that
his
forehead
was
high
flat
and
narrow
his
nose
was
a
large
fleshy
hawklike
beak
and
from
the
side
of
each
nostril
a
deep
indentation
extended
downwards
until
it
disappeared
in
the
dropping
moustache
that
concealed
his
mouth
the
vast
extent
of
which
was
perceived
only
when
he
opened
it
to
bellow
at
the
workmen
his
exhortations
to
greater
exertions
his
chin
was
large
and
extraordinarily
long
the
eyes
were
pale
blue
very
small
and
close
together
surmounted
by
spare
almost
invisible
eyebrows
with
a
deep
vertical
cleft
between
them
over
the
nose
his
head
covered
with
thick
coarse
brown
hair
was
very
large
at
the
back
the
ears
were
small
and
laid
close
to
the
head
if
one
were
to
make
a
drawing
of
his
cadaverous
visage
it
would
be
found
that
the
outline
resembled
that
of
the
lid
of
a
coffin
this
man
had
been
with
rushton
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
for
fifteen
years
in
fact
almost
from
the
time
when
the
latter
commenced
business
rushton
had
at
that
period
realized
the
necessity
of
having
a
deputy
who
could
be
used
to
do
all
the
drudgery
and
running
about
so
that
he
himself
might
be
free
to
attend
to
the
more
pleasant
or
profitable
matters
hunter
was
then
a
journeyman
but
was
on
the
point
of
starting
on
his
own
account
when
rushton
offered
him
a
constant
job
as
foreman
two
pounds
a
week
and
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
the
profits
of
all
work
done
on
the
face
of
it
this
appeared
a
generous
offer
hunter
closed
with
it
gave
up
the
idea
of
starting
for
himself
and
threw
himself
heart
and
mind
into
the
business
when
an
estimate
was
to
be
prepared
it
was
hunter
who
measured
up
the
work
and
laboriously
figured
out
the
probably
cost
when
their
tenders
were
accepted
it
was
he
who
superintended
the
work
and
schemed
how
to
scamp
it
where
possible
using
mud
where
mortar
was
specified
mortar
where
there
ought
to
have
been
cement
sheet
zinc
where
they
were
supposed
to
put
sheet
lead
boiled
oil
instead
of
varnish
and
three
coats
of
paint
where
five
were
paid
for
in
fact
scamping
the
work
was
with
this
man
a
kind
of
mania
it
grieved
him
to
see
anything
done
properly
even
when
it
was
more
economical
to
do
a
thing
well
he
insisted
from
force
of
habit
on
having
it
scamped
then
he
was
almost
happy
because
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
someone
down
if
there
were
an
architect
superintending
the
work
misery
would
square
him
or
bluff
him
if
it
were
not
possible
to
do
either
at
least
he
had
a
try
and
in
the
intervals
of
watching
driving
and
bullying
the
hands
his
vulture
eye
was
ever
on
the
look
out
for
fresh
jobs
his
long
red
nose
was
thrust
into
every
estate
agent
office
in
the
town
in
the
endeavour
to
smell
out
what
properties
had
recently
changed
hands
or
been
let
in
order
that
he
might
interview
the
new
owners
and
secure
the
order
for
whatever
alterations
or
repairs
might
be
required
he
it
was
who
entered
into
unholy
compacts
with
numerous
charwomen
and
nurses
of
the
sick
who
in
return
for
a
small
commission
would
let
him
know
when
some
poor
sufferer
was
passing
away
and
would
recommend
rushton
to
the
bereaved
and
distracted
relatives
by
these
means
often
after
first
carefully
inquiring
into
the
financial
position
of
the
stricken
family
misery
would
contrive
to
wriggle
his
unsavoury
carcass
into
the
house
of
sorrow
seeking
even
in
the
chamber
of
death
to
further
the
interests
of
rushton
and
to
earn
his
miserable
two
and
a
half
per
cent
it
was
to
make
possible
the
attainment
of
this
object
that
misery
slaved
and
drove
and
schemed
and
cheated
it
was
for
this
that
the
workers
wages
were
cut
down
to
the
lowest
possible
point
and
their
offspring
went
ill
clad
ill
shod
and
ill
fed
and
were
driven
forth
to
labour
while
they
were
yet
children
because
their
fathers
were
unable
to
earn
enough
to
support
their
homes
fifteen
years
hunter
realized
now
that
rushton
had
had
considerably
the
best
of
the
bargain
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
seen
that
the
latter
had
bought
over
one
who
might
have
proved
a
dangerous
competitor
and
now
after
fifteen
years
the
business
that
had
been
so
laboriously
built
up
mainly
by
hunter
energy
industry
and
unscrupulous
cunning
belonged
to
rushton
hunter
was
but
an
employee
liable
to
dismissal
like
any
other
workman
the
only
difference
being
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
week
notice
instead
of
an
hour
notice
and
was
but
little
better
off
financially
than
when
he
started
for
the
firm
fifteen
years
hunter
knew
now
that
he
had
been
used
but
he
also
knew
that
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
he
had
not
saved
enough
to
make
a
successful
start
on
his
own
account
even
if
he
had
felt
mentally
and
physically
capable
of
beginning
all
over
again
and
if
rushton
were
to
discharge
him
right
now
he
was
too
old
to
get
a
job
as
a
journeyman
further
in
his
zeal
for
rushton
and
his
anxiety
to
earn
his
commission
he
had
often
done
things
that
had
roused
the
animosity
of
rival
firms
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
highly
improbable
that
any
of
them
would
employ
him
and
even
if
they
would
misery
heart
failed
him
at
the
thought
of
having
to
meet
on
an
equal
footing
those
workmen
whom
he
had
tyrannized
over
and
oppressed
it
was
for
these
reasons
that
hunter
was
as
terrified
of
rushton
as
the
hands
were
of
himself
over
the
men
stood
misery
ever
threatening
them
with
dismissal
and
their
wives
and
children
with
hunger
behind
misery
was
rushton
ever
bullying
and
goading
him
on
to
greater
excesses
and
efforts
for
the
furtherance
of
the
good
cause
which
was
to
enable
the
head
of
the
firm
to
accumulate
money
mr
hunter
at
the
moment
when
the
reader
first
makes
his
acquaintance
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
the
incidents
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
took
place
was
executing
a
kind
of
strategic
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
house
where
crass
and
his
mates
were
working
he
kept
to
one
side
of
the
road
because
by
so
doing
he
could
not
be
perceived
by
those
within
the
house
until
the
instant
of
his
arrival
when
he
was
within
about
a
hundred
yards
of
the
gate
he
dismounted
from
his
bicycle
there
being
a
sharp
rise
in
the
road
just
there
and
as
he
toiled
up
pushing
the
bicycle
in
front
his
breath
showing
in
white
clouds
in
the
frosty
air
he
observed
a
number
of
men
hanging
about
some
of
them
he
knew
they
had
worked
for
him
at
various
times
but
were
now
out
of
a
job
there
were
five
men
altogether
three
of
them
were
standing
in
a
group
the
other
two
stood
each
by
himself
being
apparently
strangers
to
each
other
and
the
first
three
the
three
men
who
stood
together
were
nearest
to
hunter
and
as
the
latter
approached
one
of
them
advanced
to
meet
him
afternoon
sir
hunter
replied
by
an
inarticulate
grunt
without
stopping
the
man
followed
chance
of
a
job
sir
up
replied
hunter
still
without
stopping
the
man
still
followed
like
a
beggar
soliciting
charity
any
use
calling
in
a
day
or
so
sir
think
so
hunter
replied
if
you
like
but
we
full
up
you
sir
said
the
man
and
turned
back
to
his
friends
by
this
time
hunter
was
within
a
few
yards
of
one
of
the
other
two
men
who
also
came
to
speak
to
him
this
man
felt
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
a
job
still
there
was
no
harm
in
asking
besides
he
was
getting
desperate
it
was
over
a
month
now
since
he
had
finished
up
for
his
last
employer
it
had
been
a
very
slow
summer
altogether
sometimes
a
fortnight
for
one
firm
then
perhaps
a
week
doing
nothing
then
three
weeks
or
a
month
for
another
firm
then
out
again
and
so
on
and
now
it
was
november
last
winter
they
had
got
into
debt
that
was
nothing
unusual
but
owing
to
the
bad
summer
they
had
not
been
able
as
in
other
years
to
pay
off
the
debts
accumulated
in
winter
it
was
doubtful
too
whether
they
would
be
able
to
get
credit
again
this
winter
in
fact
this
morning
when
his
wife
sent
their
little
girl
to
the
grocer
for
some
butter
the
latter
had
refused
to
let
the
child
have
it
without
the
money
so
although
he
felt
it
to
be
useless
he
accosted
hunter
this
time
hunter
stopped
he
was
winded
by
his
climb
up
the
hill
afternoon
sir
hunter
did
not
return
the
salutation
he
had
not
the
breath
to
spare
but
the
man
was
not
hurt
he
was
used
to
being
treated
like
that
chance
of
a
job
sir
hunter
did
not
reply
at
once
he
was
short
of
breath
and
he
was
thinking
of
a
plan
that
was
ever
recurring
to
his
mind
and
which
he
had
lately
been
hankering
to
put
into
execution
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
long
waited
for
opportunity
had
come
just
now
rushton
were
almost
the
only
firm
in
mugsborough
who
had
any
work
there
were
dozens
of
good
workmen
out
yes
this
was
the
time
if
this
man
agreed
he
would
give
him
a
start
hunter
knew
the
man
was
a
good
workman
he
had
worked
for
rushton
before
to
make
room
for
him
old
linden
and
some
other
man
could
be
got
rid
of
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
some
excuse
hunter
said
at
last
in
a
doubtful
hesitating
kind
of
way
afraid
not
newman
we
about
full
up
he
ceased
speaking
and
remained
waiting
for
the
other
to
say
something
more
he
did
not
look
at
the
man
but
stooped
down
fidgeting
with
the
mechanism
of
the
bicycle
as
if
adjusting
it
have
been
so
bad
this
summer
newman
went
on
had
rather
a
rough
time
of
it
i
would
be
very
glad
of
a
job
even
if
it
was
only
for
a
week
or
so
there
was
a
pause
after
a
while
hunter
raised
his
eyes
to
the
other
face
but
immediately
let
them
fall
again
said
he
might
perhaps
be
able
to
let
you
have
a
day
or
two
you
can
come
here
to
this
job
and
he
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
house
where
the
men
were
working
at
seven
of
course
you
know
the
figure
he
added
as
newman
was
about
to
thank
him
and
a
half
hunter
spoke
as
if
the
reduction
were
already
an
accomplished
fact
the
man
was
more
likely
to
agree
if
he
thought
that
others
were
already
working
at
the
reduced
rate
newman
was
taken
by
surprise
and
hesitated
he
had
never
worked
under
price
indeed
he
had
sometimes
gone
hungry
rather
than
do
so
but
now
it
seemed
that
others
were
doing
it
and
then
he
was
so
awfully
hard
up
if
he
refused
this
job
he
was
not
likely
to
get
another
in
a
hurry
he
thought
of
his
home
and
his
family
already
they
owed
five
weeks
rent
and
last
monday
the
collector
had
hinted
pretty
plainly
that
the
landlord
would
not
wait
much
longer
not
only
that
but
if
he
did
not
get
a
job
how
were
they
to
live
this
morning
he
himself
had
had
no
breakfast
to
speak
of
only
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
dry
bread
these
thoughts
crowded
upon
each
other
in
his
mind
but
still
he
hesitated
hunter
began
to
move
off
he
said
you
like
to
start
you
can
come
here
at
seven
in
the
morning
then
as
newman
still
hesitated
he
added
impatiently
you
coming
or
not
sir
said
newman
right
said
hunter
affably
tell
crass
to
have
a
kit
ready
for
you
he
nodded
in
a
friendly
way
to
the
man
who
went
off
feeling
like
a
criminal
as
hunter
resumed
his
march
well
pleased
with
himself
the
fifth
man
who
had
been
waiting
all
this
time
came
to
meet
him
as
he
approached
hunter
recognized
him
as
one
who
had
started
work
for
rushton
co
early
in
the
summer
but
who
had
left
suddenly
of
his
own
accord
having
taken
offence
at
some
bullying
remark
of
hunter
hunter
was
glad
to
see
this
man
he
guessed
that
the
fellow
must
be
very
hard
pressed
to
come
again
and
ask
for
work
after
what
had
happened
chance
of
a
job
sir
hunter
appeared
to
reflect
believe
i
have
room
for
one
he
said
at
length
you
such
an
uncertain
kind
of
chap
you
do
seem
to
care
much
whether
you
work
or
not
you
too
independent
you
know
one
ca
say
two
words
to
you
but
you
must
needs
clear
off
the
man
made
no
answer
ca
tolerate
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
hunter
added
we
were
to
encourage
men
of
your
stamp
we
should
never
know
where
we
are
so
saying
hunter
moved
away
and
again
proceeded
on
his
journey
when
he
arrived
within
about
three
yards
of
the
gate
he
noiselessly
laid
his
machine
against
the
garden
fence
the
high
evergreens
that
grew
inside
still
concealed
him
from
the
observation
of
anyone
who
might
be
looking
out
of
the
windows
of
the
house
then
he
carefully
crept
along
till
he
came
to
the
gate
post
and
bending
down
he
cautiously
peeped
round
to
see
if
he
could
detect
anyone
idling
or
talking
or
smoking
there
was
no
one
in
sight
except
old
jack
linden
who
was
rubbing
down
the
lobby
doors
with
and
water
hunter
noiselessly
opened
the
gate
and
crept
quietly
along
the
grass
border
of
the
garden
path
his
idea
was
to
reach
the
front
door
without
being
seen
so
that
linden
could
not
give
notice
of
his
approach
to
those
within
in
this
he
succeeded
and
passed
silently
into
the
house
he
did
not
speak
to
linden
to
do
so
would
have
proclaimed
his
presence
to
the
rest
he
crawled
stealthily
over
the
house
but
was
disappointed
in
his
quest
for
everyone
he
saw
was
hard
at
work
upstairs
he
noticed
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
was
closed
old
joe
philpot
had
been
working
in
this
room
all
day
washing
off
the
old
whitewash
from
the
ceiling
and
removing
the
old
papers
from
the
walls
with
a
broad
bladed
square
topped
knife
called
a
stripper
although
it
was
only
a
small
room
joe
had
had
to
tear
into
the
work
pretty
hard
all
the
time
for
the
ceiling
seemed
to
have
had
two
or
three
coats
of
whitewash
without
ever
having
been
washed
off
and
there
were
several
thicknesses
of
paper
on
the
walls
the
difficulty
of
removing
these
papers
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
dado
which
had
been
varnished
in
order
to
get
this
off
it
had
been
necessary
to
soak
it
several
times
with
strong
soda
water
and
although
joe
was
as
careful
as
possible
he
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
getting
some
of
this
stuff
on
his
fingers
the
result
was
that
his
nails
were
all
burnt
and
discoloured
and
the
flesh
round
them
cracked
and
bleeding
however
he
had
got
it
all
off
at
last
and
he
was
not
sorry
for
his
right
arm
and
shoulder
were
aching
from
the
prolonged
strain
and
in
the
palm
of
the
right
hand
there
was
a
blister
as
large
as
a
shilling
caused
by
the
handle
of
the
stripping
knife
all
the
old
paper
being
off
joe
washed
down
the
walls
with
water
and
having
swept
the
paper
into
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
mixed
with
a
small
trowel
some
cement
on
a
small
board
and
proceeded
to
stop
up
the
cracks
and
holes
in
the
walls
and
ceiling
after
a
while
feeling
very
tired
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
deserved
a
spell
and
a
smoke
for
five
minutes
he
closed
the
door
and
placed
a
pair
of
steps
against
it
there
were
two
windows
in
the
room
almost
opposite
each
other
these
he
opened
wide
in
order
that
the
smoke
and
smell
of
his
pipe
might
be
carried
away
having
taken
these
precautions
against
surprise
he
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
step
ladder
that
he
had
laid
against
the
door
and
sat
down
at
ease
within
easy
reach
was
the
top
of
a
cupboard
where
he
had
concealed
a
pint
of
beer
in
a
bottle
to
this
he
now
applied
himself
having
taken
a
long
pull
at
the
bottle
he
tenderly
replaced
it
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
and
proceeded
to
a
quiet
smoke
remarking
to
himself
is
where
we
get
some
of
our
own
back
he
held
however
his
trowel
in
one
hand
ready
for
immediate
action
in
case
of
interruption
philpot
was
about
years
old
he
wore
no
white
jacket
only
an
old
patched
apron
his
trousers
were
old
very
soiled
with
paint
and
ragged
at
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
where
they
fell
over
the
broken
and
boots
the
part
of
his
waistcoat
not
protected
by
his
apron
was
covered
with
spots
of
dried
paint
he
wore
a
coloured
shirt
and
a
which
was
very
soiled
and
covered
with
splashes
of
paint
and
one
side
of
it
was
projecting
from
the
opening
of
the
waistcoat
his
head
was
covered
with
an
old
cap
heavy
and
shining
with
paint
he
was
very
thin
and
stooped
slightly
although
he
was
really
only
he
looked
much
older
for
he
was
prematurely
aged
he
had
not
been
getting
his
own
back
for
quite
five
minutes
when
hunter
softly
turned
the
handle
of
the
lock
philpot
immediately
put
out
his
pipe
and
descending
from
his
perch
opened
the
door
when
hunter
entered
philpot
closed
it
again
and
mounting
the
steps
went
on
stripping
the
wall
just
above
nimrod
looked
at
him
suspiciously
wondering
why
the
door
had
been
closed
he
looked
all
round
the
room
but
could
see
nothing
to
complain
of
he
sniffed
the
air
to
try
if
he
could
detect
the
odour
of
tobacco
and
if
he
had
not
been
suffering
a
cold
in
the
head
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
perceived
it
however
as
it
was
he
could
smell
nothing
but
all
the
same
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
although
he
remembered
that
crass
always
gave
philpot
a
good
character
do
like
to
have
men
working
on
a
job
like
this
with
the
door
shut
he
said
at
length
always
gives
me
the
idear
that
the
a
mike
you
can
do
what
you
doin
just
as
well
with
the
door
open
philpot
muttering
something
about
it
being
all
the
same
to
him
shut
or
open
got
down
from
the
steps
and
opened
the
door
hunter
went
out
again
without
making
any
further
remark
and
once
more
began
crawling
over
the
house
owen
was
working
by
himself
in
a
room
on
the
same
floor
as
philpot
he
was
at
the
window
burning
off
with
a
paraffin
those
parts
of
the
old
paintwork
that
were
blistered
and
cracked
in
this
work
the
flame
of
the
lamp
is
directed
against
the
old
paint
which
becomes
soft
and
is
removed
with
a
chisel
knife
or
a
scraper
called
a
shavehook
the
door
was
ajar
and
he
had
opened
the
top
sash
of
the
window
for
the
purpose
of
letting
in
some
fresh
air
because
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
foul
with
the
fumes
of
the
lamp
and
the
smell
of
the
burning
paint
besides
being
heavy
with
moisture
the
ceiling
had
only
just
been
water
washed
and
the
walls
had
just
been
stripped
the
old
paper
saturated
with
water
was
piled
up
in
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
presently
as
he
was
working
he
began
to
feel
conscious
of
some
other
presence
in
the
room
he
looked
round
the
door
was
open
about
six
inches
and
in
the
opening
appeared
a
long
pale
face
with
a
huge
chin
surmounted
by
a
bowler
hat
and
ornamented
with
a
large
red
nose
a
drooping
moustache
and
two
small
glittering
eyes
set
very
close
together
for
some
seconds
this
apparition
regarded
owen
intently
then
it
was
silently
withdrawn
and
he
was
again
alone
he
had
been
so
surprised
and
startled
that
he
had
nearly
dropped
the
lamp
and
now
that
the
ghastly
countenance
was
gone
owen
felt
the
blood
surge
into
his
own
cheeks
he
trembled
with
suppressed
fury
and
longed
to
be
able
to
go
out
there
on
the
landing
and
hurl
the
lamp
into
hunter
face
meanwhile
on
the
landing
outside
owen
door
hunter
stood
thinking
someone
must
be
got
rid
of
to
make
room
for
the
cheap
man
tomorrow
he
had
hoped
to
catch
somebody
doing
something
that
would
have
served
as
an
excuse
for
instant
dismissal
but
there
was
now
no
hope
of
that
happening
what
was
to
be
done
he
would
like
to
get
rid
of
linden
who
was
now
really
too
old
to
be
of
much
use
but
as
the
old
man
had
worked
for
rushton
on
and
off
for
many
years
hunter
felt
that
he
could
scarcely
sack
him
off
hand
without
some
reasonable
pretext
still
the
fellow
was
really
not
worth
the
money
he
was
getting
sevenpence
an
hour
was
an
absurdly
large
wage
for
an
old
man
like
him
it
was
preposterous
he
would
have
to
go
excuse
or
no
excuse
hunter
crawled
downstairs
again
jack
linden
was
about
years
old
but
like
philpot
and
as
is
usual
with
working
men
he
appeared
older
because
he
had
had
to
work
very
hard
all
his
life
frequently
without
proper
food
and
clothing
his
life
had
been
passed
in
the
midst
of
a
civilization
which
he
had
never
been
permitted
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
but
of
course
he
knew
nothing
about
all
this
he
had
never
expected
or
wished
to
be
allowed
to
enjoy
such
things
he
had
always
been
of
opinion
that
they
were
never
intended
for
the
likes
of
him
he
called
himself
a
conservative
and
was
very
patriotic
at
the
time
when
the
boer
war
commenced
linden
was
an
enthusiastic
jingo
his
enthusiasm
had
been
somewhat
damped
when
his
youngest
son
a
reservist
had
to
go
to
the
front
where
he
died
of
fever
and
exposure
when
this
soldier
son
went
away
he
left
his
wife
and
two
children
aged
respectively
four
and
five
years
at
that
time
in
his
care
after
he
died
they
stayed
on
with
the
old
people
the
young
woman
earned
a
little
occasionally
by
doing
needlework
but
was
really
dependent
on
her
notwithstanding
his
poverty
he
was
glad
to
have
them
in
the
house
because
of
late
years
his
wife
had
been
getting
very
feeble
and
since
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
news
of
the
death
of
her
son
needed
someone
constantly
with
her
linden
was
still
working
at
the
vestibule
doors
when
the
manager
came
downstairs
misery
stood
watching
him
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
at
last
he
said
loudly
much
longer
are
you
going
to
be
messing
about
those
doors
why
do
you
get
them
under
colour
you
were
fooling
about
there
when
i
was
here
this
morning
do
you
think
it
pay
to
have
you
playing
about
there
hour
after
hour
with
a
bit
of
pumice
stone
get
the
work
done
or
if
you
do
want
to
i
very
soon
find
someone
else
who
does
i
been
noticing
your
style
of
doing
things
for
some
time
past
and
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
ca
play
the
fool
with
me
there
plenty
of
better
men
than
you
walking
about
if
you
ca
do
more
than
you
been
doing
lately
you
can
clear
out
we
can
do
without
you
even
when
we
busy
old
jack
trembled
he
tried
to
answer
but
was
unable
to
speak
if
he
had
been
a
slave
and
had
failed
to
satisfy
his
master
the
latter
might
have
tied
him
up
somewhere
and
thrashed
him
hunter
could
not
do
that
he
could
only
take
his
food
away
old
jack
was
frightened
it
was
not
only
his
food
that
might
be
taken
away
at
last
with
a
great
effort
for
the
words
seemed
to
stick
in
his
throat
he
said
must
clean
the
work
down
sir
before
i
go
on
painting
not
talking
about
what
you
doing
but
the
time
it
takes
you
to
do
it
shouted
hunter
i
do
want
any
back
answers
or
argument
about
it
you
must
move
yourself
a
bit
quicker
or
leave
it
alone
altogether
linden
did
not
answer
he
went
on
with
his
work
his
hand
trembling
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
hold
the
pumice
stone
hunter
shouted
so
loud
that
his
voice
filled
all
the
house
everyone
heard
and
was
afraid
who
would
be
the
next
they
thought
finding
that
linden
made
no
further
answer
misery
again
began
walking
about
the
house
as
he
looked
at
them
the
men
did
their
work
in
a
nervous
clumsy
hasty
sort
of
way
they
made
all
sorts
of
mistakes
and
messes
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
was
putting
some
new
boards
on
a
part
of
the
floor
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
panic
that
while
driving
a
nail
he
accidentally
struck
the
thumb
of
his
left
hand
a
severe
blow
with
his
hammer
bundy
was
also
working
in
the
putting
some
tiles
in
the
fireplace
whilst
cutting
one
of
these
in
half
in
order
to
fit
it
into
its
place
he
inflicted
a
deep
gash
on
one
of
his
fingers
he
was
afraid
to
leave
off
to
bind
it
up
while
hunter
was
there
and
consequently
as
he
worked
the
white
tiles
became
all
smeared
and
spattered
with
blood
easton
who
was
working
with
harlow
on
a
plank
washing
off
the
old
distemper
from
the
hall
ceiling
was
so
upset
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
on
the
plank
and
presently
the
brush
fell
from
his
trembling
hand
with
a
crash
upon
the
floor
everyone
was
afraid
they
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
job
for
any
other
firm
they
knew
that
this
man
had
the
power
to
deprive
them
of
the
means
of
earning
a
living
that
he
possessed
the
power
to
deprive
their
children
of
bread
owen
listening
to
hunter
over
the
banisters
upstairs
felt
that
he
would
like
to
take
him
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
and
smash
his
face
in
with
the
other
and
then
why
then
he
would
be
sent
to
gaol
or
at
the
best
he
would
lose
his
employment
his
food
and
that
of
his
family
would
be
taken
away
that
was
why
he
only
ground
his
teeth
and
cursed
and
beat
the
wall
with
his
clenched
fist
so
and
so
and
so
if
it
were
not
for
them
owen
imagination
ran
riot
first
he
would
seize
him
by
the
collar
with
his
left
hand
dig
his
knuckles
into
his
throat
force
him
up
against
the
wall
and
then
with
his
right
fist
smash
smash
smash
until
hunter
face
was
all
cut
and
covered
with
blood
but
then
what
about
those
at
home
was
it
not
braver
and
more
manly
to
endure
in
silence
owen
leaned
against
the
wall
panting
and
exhausted
downstairs
misery
was
still
going
to
and
fro
in
the
house
and
walking
up
and
down
in
it
presently
he
stopped
to
look
at
sawkins
work
this
man
was
painting
the
woodwork
of
the
back
staircase
although
the
old
paintwork
here
was
very
dirty
and
greasy
misery
had
given
orders
that
it
was
not
to
be
cleaned
before
being
painted
dust
it
down
and
slobber
the
colour
on
he
had
said
consequently
when
crass
made
the
paint
he
had
put
into
it
an
extra
large
quantity
of
dryers
to
a
certain
extent
this
destroyed
the
of
the
colour
it
did
not
cover
well
it
would
require
two
coats
when
hunter
perceived
this
he
was
furious
he
was
sure
it
could
be
made
to
do
with
one
coat
with
a
little
care
he
believed
sawkins
was
doing
it
like
this
on
purpose
really
these
men
seemed
to
have
no
conscience
two
coats
and
he
had
estimated
for
only
three
sir
here
sir
crass
came
hurrying
along
the
meaning
of
this
did
i
tell
you
to
make
this
do
with
one
coat
look
at
it
like
this
sir
said
crass
it
had
been
washed
down
down
be
damned
shouted
hunter
reason
is
that
the
colour
ai
thick
enough
take
the
paint
and
put
a
little
more
body
in
it
and
we
soon
see
whether
it
can
be
done
or
not
i
can
make
it
cover
if
you
ca
crass
took
the
paint
and
superintended
by
hunter
made
it
thicker
misery
then
seized
the
brush
and
prepared
to
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
finishing
the
work
with
one
coat
crass
and
sawkins
looked
on
in
silence
just
as
misery
was
about
to
commence
he
fancied
he
heard
someone
whispering
somewhere
he
laid
down
the
brush
and
crawled
stealthily
upstairs
to
see
who
it
was
directly
his
back
was
turned
crass
seized
a
bottle
of
oil
that
was
standing
near
and
tipping
about
half
a
pint
of
it
into
the
paint
stirred
it
up
quickly
misery
returned
almost
immediately
he
had
not
caught
anyone
it
must
have
been
fancy
he
took
up
the
brush
and
began
to
paint
the
result
was
worse
than
sawkins
he
messed
and
fooled
about
for
some
time
but
could
not
make
it
come
right
at
last
he
gave
it
up
suppose
it
have
to
have
two
coats
after
all
he
said
mournfully
it
a
thousand
pities
he
almost
wept
the
firm
would
be
ruined
if
things
went
on
like
this
better
go
on
with
it
he
said
as
he
laid
down
the
brush
he
began
to
walk
about
the
house
again
he
wanted
to
go
away
now
but
he
did
not
want
them
to
know
that
he
was
gone
so
he
sneaked
out
of
the
back
door
crept
around
the
house
and
out
of
the
gate
mounted
his
bicycle
and
rode
away
no
one
saw
him
go
for
some
time
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
silence
were
the
noises
made
by
the
hands
as
they
worked
the
musical
ringing
of
trowel
the
noise
of
the
carpenters
hammers
and
saws
and
the
occasional
moving
of
a
pair
of
steps
no
one
dared
to
speak
at
last
philpot
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
was
very
thirsty
he
had
kept
the
door
of
his
room
open
since
hunter
arrived
he
listened
intently
he
felt
certain
that
hunter
must
be
gone
he
looked
across
the
landing
and
could
see
owen
working
in
the
front
room
philpot
made
a
little
ball
of
paper
and
threw
it
at
him
to
attract
his
attention
owen
looked
round
and
philpot
began
to
make
signals
he
pointed
downwards
with
one
hand
and
jerked
the
thumb
of
the
other
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
town
winking
grotesquely
the
while
this
owen
interpreted
to
be
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
hunter
had
departed
he
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
intimate
that
he
did
not
know
philpot
cautiously
crossed
the
landing
and
peeped
furtively
over
the
banisters
listening
breathlessly
it
gorn
or
not
he
wondered
he
crept
along
on
tiptoe
towards
owen
room
glancing
left
and
right
the
trowel
in
his
hand
and
looking
like
a
stage
murderer
you
think
it
gorn
he
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
when
he
reached
door
do
know
replied
owen
in
a
low
tone
philpot
wondered
he
must
have
a
drink
but
it
would
never
do
for
hunter
to
see
him
with
the
bottle
he
must
find
out
somehow
whether
he
was
gone
or
not
at
last
an
idea
came
he
would
go
downstairs
to
get
some
more
cement
having
confided
this
plan
to
owen
he
crept
quietly
back
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
working
then
he
walked
noisily
across
the
landing
again
a
bit
of
stopping
to
spare
frank
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
replied
owen
not
using
it
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
down
and
get
some
is
there
anything
i
can
bring
up
for
you
thanks
replied
owen
philpot
marched
boldly
down
to
the
scullery
which
crass
had
utilized
as
a
crass
was
there
mixing
some
colour
want
a
bit
of
stopping
philpot
said
as
he
helped
himself
to
some
the
b
r
gorn
whispered
crass
do
know
replied
philpot
his
bike
always
leaves
it
outside
the
gate
so
we
ca
see
it
replied
crass
you
what
whispered
philpot
after
a
pause
the
boy
a
hempty
bottle
and
let
go
to
the
gate
and
look
to
the
bikes
there
if
misery
sees
him
can
pretend
to
be
goin
to
the
shop
for
some
hoil
this
was
done
bert
went
to
the
gate
and
returned
almost
immediately
the
bike
was
gone
as
the
good
news
spread
through
the
house
a
chorus
of
thanksgiving
burst
forth
gord
said
one
the
b
r
falls
orf
and
breaks
bloody
neck
said
another
are
all
the
same
no
one
ever
knew
one
to
be
any
good
yet
cried
a
third
directly
they
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
gone
nearly
everyone
left
off
work
for
a
few
minutes
to
curse
him
then
they
again
went
on
working
and
now
that
they
were
relieved
of
the
embarrassment
that
misery
presence
inspired
they
made
better
progress
a
few
of
them
lit
their
pipes
and
smoked
as
they
worked
one
of
these
was
old
jack
linden
he
was
upset
by
the
bullying
he
had
received
and
when
he
noticed
some
of
the
others
smoking
he
thought
he
would
have
a
pipe
it
might
steady
his
nerves
as
a
rule
he
did
not
smoke
when
working
it
was
contrary
to
orders
as
philpot
was
returning
to
work
again
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
whisper
to
linden
with
the
result
that
the
latter
accompanied
him
upstairs
on
reaching
philpot
room
the
latter
placed
the
near
the
cupboard
and
taking
down
the
bottle
of
beer
handed
it
to
linden
with
the
remark
some
of
that
acrost
yer
matey
it
put
yer
right
while
linden
was
taking
a
hasty
drink
joe
kept
watch
on
the
landing
outside
in
case
hunter
should
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
reappear
when
linden
was
gone
downstairs
again
philpot
having
finished
what
remained
of
the
beer
and
hidden
the
bottle
up
the
chimney
resumed
the
work
of
stopping
up
the
holes
and
cracks
in
the
ceiling
and
walls
he
must
make
a
bit
of
a
show
tonight
or
there
would
be
a
hell
of
a
row
when
misery
came
in
the
morning
owen
worked
on
in
a
disheartened
sullen
way
he
felt
like
a
beaten
dog
he
was
more
indignant
on
poor
old
linden
account
than
on
his
own
and
was
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
impotence
and
shameful
degradation
all
his
life
it
had
been
the
same
incessant
work
under
similar
more
or
less
humiliating
conditions
and
with
no
more
result
than
being
just
able
to
avoid
starvation
and
the
future
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
as
hopeless
as
the
past
darker
for
there
would
surely
come
a
time
if
he
lived
long
enough
when
he
would
be
unable
to
work
any
more
he
thought
of
his
child
was
he
to
be
a
slave
and
a
drudge
all
his
life
also
it
would
be
better
for
the
boy
to
die
now
as
owen
thought
of
his
child
future
there
sprung
up
within
him
a
feeling
of
hatred
and
fury
against
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
they
were
the
enemy
those
who
not
only
quietly
submitted
like
so
many
cattle
to
the
existing
state
of
things
but
defended
it
and
opposed
and
ridiculed
any
suggestion
to
alter
it
they
were
the
real
oppressors
the
men
who
spoke
of
themselves
as
likes
of
us
who
having
lived
in
poverty
and
degradation
all
their
lives
considered
that
what
had
been
good
enough
for
them
was
good
enough
for
the
children
they
had
been
the
cause
of
bringing
into
existence
he
hated
and
despised
them
because
they
calmly
saw
their
children
condemned
to
hard
labour
and
poverty
for
life
and
deliberately
refused
to
make
any
effort
to
secure
for
them
better
conditions
than
those
they
had
themselves
it
was
because
they
were
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
their
children
that
he
would
be
unable
to
secure
a
natural
and
human
life
for
his
it
was
their
apathy
or
active
opposition
that
made
it
impossible
to
establish
a
better
system
of
society
under
which
those
who
did
their
fair
share
of
the
world
work
would
be
honoured
and
rewarded
instead
of
helping
to
do
this
they
abased
themselves
and
grovelled
before
their
oppressors
and
compelled
and
taught
their
children
to
do
the
same
they
were
the
people
who
were
really
responsible
for
the
continuance
of
the
present
system
owen
laughed
bitterly
to
himself
what
a
very
comical
system
it
was
those
who
worked
were
looked
upon
with
contempt
and
subjected
to
every
possible
indignity
nearly
everything
they
produced
was
taken
away
from
them
and
enjoyed
by
the
people
who
did
nothing
and
then
the
workers
bowed
down
and
grovelled
before
those
who
had
robbed
them
of
the
fruits
of
their
labour
and
were
childishly
grateful
to
them
for
leaving
anything
at
all
no
wonder
the
rich
despised
them
and
looked
upon
them
as
dirt
they
were
despicable
they
were
dirt
they
admitted
it
and
gloried
in
it
while
these
thoughts
were
seething
in
owen
mind
his
fellow
workmen
were
still
patiently
toiling
on
downstairs
most
of
them
had
by
this
time
dismissed
hunter
from
their
thoughts
they
did
not
take
things
so
seriously
as
owen
they
flattered
themselves
that
they
had
more
sense
than
that
it
could
not
be
altered
grin
and
bear
it
after
all
it
was
only
for
life
make
the
best
of
things
and
get
your
own
back
whenever
you
get
a
chance
presently
harlow
began
to
sing
he
had
a
good
voice
and
it
was
a
good
song
but
his
mates
just
then
did
not
appreciate
either
one
of
the
other
his
singing
was
the
signal
for
an
outburst
of
exclamations
and
catcalls
it
for
christ
sake
enough
of
that
bloody
row
and
so
on
harlow
stopped
the
enemy
asked
easton
presently
addressing
no
one
in
particular
know
replied
bundy
must
be
about
half
past
four
ask
slyme
he
got
a
watch
it
was
a
quarter
past
four
gets
dark
very
early
now
said
easton
replied

very
dull

think

wind

replied
easton
means

wet
shirt
goin
he
called
out
to
old
jack
linden
who
was
still
working
at
the
front
doors
it
raining
jack
old
jack
his
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
turned
to
look
at
the
weather
it
was
raining
but
linden
did
not
see
the
large
drops
which
splashed
heavily
upon
the
ground
he
saw
only
hunter
who
was
standing
at
the
gate
watching
him
for
a
few
seconds
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
linden
was
paralysed
with
fear
recovering
himself
he
hastily
removed
his
pipe
but
it
was
too
late
misery
strode
up
do
pay
you
for
smoking
he
said
loudly
out
your
time
sheet
take
it
to
the
office
and
get
your
money
i
had
enough
of
you
jack
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
he
knew
it
was
of
no
use
he
silently
put
aside
the
things
he
had
been
using
went
into
the
room
where
he
had
left
his
and
coat
removed
his
apron
and
white
jacket
folded
them
up
and
put
them
into
his
along
with
the
tools
he
had
been
using
a
and
a
shavehook
put
on
his
coat
and
with
the
slung
over
his
shoulder
went
away
from
the
house
without
speaking
to
anyone
else
hunter
then
hastily
walked
over
the
place
noting
what
progress
had
been
made
by
each
man
during
his
absence
he
then
rode
away
as
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
office
in
time
to
give
linden
his
money
it
was
now
very
cold
and
dark
within
the
house
and
as
the
gas
was
not
yet
laid
on
crass
distributed
a
number
of
candles
to
the
men
who
worked
silently
each
occupied
with
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
who
would
be
the
next
outside
sombre
masses
of
clouds
gathered
ominously
in
the
tempestuous
sky
the
gale
roared
loudly
round
the
house
and
the
windows
rattled
discordantly
rain
fell
in
torrents
they
said
it
meant
getting
wet
through
going
home
but
all
the
same
thank
god
it
was
nearly
five
chapter
the
financiers
that
night
as
easton
walked
home
through
the
rain
he
felt
very
depressed
it
had
been
a
very
bad
summer
for
most
people
and
he
had
not
fared
better
than
the
rest
a
few
weeks
with
one
firm
a
few
days
with
another
then
out
of
a
job
then
on
again
for
a
month
perhaps
and
so
on
william
easton
was
a
man
of
medium
height
about
years
old
with
fair
hair
and
moustache
and
blue
eyes
he
wore
a
collar
with
a
coloured
tie
and
his
clothes
though
shabby
were
clean
and
neat
he
was
married
his
wife
was
a
young
woman
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
when
he
happened
to
be
employed
with
others
painting
the
outside
of
the
house
where
she
was
a
general
servant
they
had
for
about
fifteen
months
easton
had
been
in
no
hurry
to
marry
for
he
knew
that
taking
good
times
with
bad
his
wages
did
no
average
a
pound
a
week
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
he
found
that
he
could
not
honourably
delay
longer
so
they
were
married
that
was
twelve
months
ago
as
a
single
man
he
had
never
troubled
much
if
he
happened
to
be
out
of
work
he
always
had
enough
to
live
on
and
pocket
money
besides
but
now
that
he
was
married
it
was
different
the
fear
of
being
haunted
him
all
the
time
he
had
started
for
rushton
on
the
previous
monday
after
having
been
idle
for
three
weeks
and
as
the
house
where
he
was
working
had
to
be
done
right
through
he
had
congratulated
himself
on
having
secured
a
job
that
would
last
till
christmas
but
he
now
began
to
fear
that
what
had
befallen
jack
linden
might
also
happen
to
himself
at
any
time
he
would
have
to
be
very
careful
not
to
offend
crass
in
any
way
he
was
afraid
the
latter
did
not
like
him
very
much
as
it
was
easton
knew
that
crass
could
get
him
the
sack
at
any
time
and
would
not
scruple
to
do
so
if
he
wanted
to
make
room
for
some
crony
of
his
own
crass
was
the
or
foreman
of
the
job
considered
as
a
workman
he
had
no
very
unusual
abilities
he
was
if
anything
inferior
to
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
but
although
he
had
but
little
real
ability
he
pretended
to
know
everything
and
the
vague
references
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
to
and
and
had
so
impressed
hunter
that
the
latter
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
as
a
workman
it
was
by
pushing
himself
forward
in
this
way
and
by
judicious
toadying
to
hunter
that
crass
managed
to
get
himself
put
in
charge
of
work
although
crass
did
as
little
work
as
possible
himself
he
took
care
that
the
others
worked
hard
any
man
who
failed
to
satisfy
him
in
this
respect
he
reported
to
hunter
as
being
good
or
slow
for
a
funeral
the
result
was
that
this
man
was
dispensed
with
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
men
knew
this
and
most
of
them
feared
the
wily
crass
accordingly
though
there
were
a
few
whose
known
abilities
placed
them
to
a
certain
extent
above
the
reach
of
his
malice
frank
owen
was
one
of
these
there
were
others
who
by
the
judicious
administration
of
pipefuls
of
tobacco
and
pints
of
beer
managed
to
keep
in
crass
good
graces
and
often
retained
their
employment
when
better
workmen
were
off
as
he
walked
home
through
the
rain
thinking
of
these
things
easton
realized
that
it
was
not
possible
to
foresee
what
a
day
or
even
an
hour
might
bring
forth
by
this
time
he
had
arrived
at
his
home
it
was
a
small
house
one
of
a
long
row
of
similar
ones
and
it
contained
altogether
four
rooms
the
front
door
opened
into
a
passage
about
two
feet
six
inches
wide
and
ten
feet
in
length
covered
with
oilcloth
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
the
first
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
front
an
apartment
about
nine
feet
square
with
a
bay
window
this
room
was
very
rarely
used
and
was
always
very
tidy
and
clean
the
mantelpiece
was
of
wood
painted
black
and
ornamented
with
jagged
streaks
of
red
and
yellow
which
were
supposed
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
marble
on
the
walls
was
a
paper
with
a
pale
ground
and
a
pattern
consisting
of
large
white
roses
with
chocolate
coloured
leaves
and
stalks
there
was
a
small
iron
fender
with
to
match
and
on
the
mantelshelf
stood
a
clock
in
a
polished
wood
case
a
pair
of
blue
glass
vases
and
some
photographs
in
frames
the
floor
was
covered
with
oilcloth
of
a
tile
pattern
in
yellow
and
red
on
the
walls
were
two
or
three
framed
coloured
prints
such
as
are
presented
with
christmas
numbers
of
illustrated
papers
there
was
also
a
photograph
of
a
group
of
sunday
school
girls
with
their
teachers
with
the
church
for
the
background
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
round
deal
table
about
three
feet
six
inches
across
with
the
legs
stained
red
to
look
like
mahogany
against
one
wall
was
an
old
couch
covered
with
faded
cretonne
four
chairs
to
match
standing
backs
to
wall
in
different
parts
of
the
room
the
table
was
covered
with
a
red
cloth
with
a
yellow
crewel
work
design
in
the
centre
and
in
each
of
the
four
corners
the
edges
being
overcast
in
the
same
material
on
the
table
were
a
lamp
and
a
number
of
brightly
bound
books
some
of
these
things
as
the
couch
and
the
chairs
easton
had
bought
and
had
done
up
himself
the
table
oilcloth
fender
hearthrug
etc
had
been
obtained
on
the
hire
system
and
were
not
yet
paid
for
the
windows
were
draped
with
white
lace
curtains
and
in
the
bay
was
a
small
bamboo
table
on
which
reposed
a
large
holy
bible
cheaply
but
showily
bound
if
anyone
had
ever
opened
this
book
they
would
have
found
that
its
pages
were
as
clean
as
the
other
things
in
the
room
and
on
the
flyleaf
might
have
been
read
the
following
inscription
dear
ruth
from
her
loving
friend
mrs
starvem
with
the
prayer
that
god
word
may
be
her
guide
and
that
jesus
may
be
her
very
own
saviour
mrs
starvem
was
ruth
former
mistress
and
this
had
been
her
parting
gift
when
ruth
left
to
get
married
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
keepsake
but
as
ruth
never
opened
the
book
and
never
willingly
allowed
her
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
the
scenes
of
which
it
reminded
her
she
had
forgotten
the
existence
of
mrs
starvem
almost
as
completely
as
that
and
pious
lady
had
forgotten
hers
for
ruth
the
memory
of
the
time
she
spent
in
the
house
of
loving
friend
was
the
reverse
of
pleasant
it
comprised
a
series
of
recollections
of
petty
tyrannies
insults
and
indignities
six
years
of
cruelly
excessive
work
beginning
every
morning
two
or
three
hours
before
the
rest
of
the
household
were
awake
and
ceasing
only
when
she
went
exhausted
to
bed
late
at
night
she
had
been
what
is
called
a
but
if
she
had
been
really
a
slave
her
owner
would
have
had
some
regard
for
her
health
and
welfare
her
friend
had
had
none
mrs
starvem
only
thought
had
been
to
get
out
of
ruth
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
labour
and
to
give
her
as
little
as
possible
in
return
when
ruth
looked
back
upon
that
dreadful
time
she
saw
it
as
one
might
say
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
religion
she
never
passed
by
a
chapel
or
heard
the
name
of
god
or
the
singing
of
a
hymn
without
thinking
of
her
former
mistress
to
have
looked
into
this
bible
would
have
reminded
her
of
mrs
starvem
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
book
reposed
unopened
and
unread
a
mere
ornament
on
the
table
in
the
bay
window
the
second
door
in
the
passage
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
led
into
the
kitchen
or
from
here
another
door
led
into
the
scullery
upstairs
were
two
bedrooms
as
easton
entered
the
house
his
wife
met
him
in
the
passage
and
asked
him
not
to
make
a
noise
as
the
child
had
just
gone
to
sleep
they
kissed
each
other
and
she
helped
him
to
remove
his
wet
overcoat
then
they
both
went
softly
into
the
kitchen
this
room
was
about
the
same
size
as
the
at
one
end
was
a
small
range
with
an
oven
and
a
boiler
and
a
high
mantelpiece
painted
black
on
the
mantelshelf
was
a
small
round
alarm
clock
and
some
brightly
polished
tin
canisters
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
facing
the
fireplace
was
a
small
dresser
on
the
shelves
of
which
were
neatly
arranged
a
number
of
plates
and
dishes
the
walls
were
papered
with
oak
paper
on
one
wall
between
two
coloured
almanacks
hung
a
tin
lamp
with
a
reflector
behind
the
light
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
an
oblong
deal
table
with
a
white
tablecloth
upon
which
the
tea
things
were
set
ready
there
were
four
kitchen
chairs
two
of
which
were
placed
close
to
the
table
overhead
across
the
room
about
eighteen
inches
down
from
the
ceiling
were
stretched
several
cords
upon
which
were
drying
a
number
of
linen
or
calico
undergarments
a
coloured
shirt
and
easton
white
apron
and
jacket
on
the
back
of
a
chair
at
one
side
of
the
fire
more
clothes
were
drying
at
the
other
side
on
the
floor
was
a
wicker
cradle
in
which
a
baby
was
sleeping
nearby
stood
a
chair
with
a
towel
hung
on
the
back
arranged
so
as
to
shade
the
infant
face
from
the
light
of
the
lamp
an
air
of
homely
comfort
pervaded
the
room
the
atmosphere
was
warm
and
the
fire
blazed
cheerfully
over
the
whitened
hearth
they
walked
softly
over
and
stood
by
the
cradle
side
looking
at
the
child
as
they
looked
the
baby
kept
moving
uneasily
in
its
sleep
its
face
was
very
flushed
and
its
eyes
were
moving
under
the
lids
every
now
and
again
its
lips
were
drawn
back
slightly
showing
part
of
the
gums
presently
it
began
to
whimper
drawing
up
its
knees
as
if
in
pain
seems
to
have
something
wrong
with
him
said
easton
think
it
his
teeth
replied
the
mother
been
very
restless
all
day
and
he
was
awake
nearly
all
last
night
he
hungry
it
ca
be
that
he
had
the
best
part
of
an
egg
this
morning
and
i
nursed
him
several
times
today
and
then
at
he
had
a
whole
saucer
full
of
fried
potatoes
with
little
bits
of
bacon
in
it
again
the
infant
whimpered
and
twisted
in
its
sleep
its
lips
drawn
back
showing
the
gums
its
knees
pressed
closely
to
its
body
the
little
fists
clenched
and
face
flushed
then
after
a
few
seconds
it
became
placid
the
mouth
resumed
its
usual
shape
the
limbs
relaxed
and
the
child
slumbered
peacefully
you
think
he
getting
thin
asked
easton
may
be
fancy
but
he
do
seem
to
me
to
be
as
big
now
as
he
was
three
months
ago
he
not
quite
so
fat
admitted
ruth
his
teeth
wearing
him
out
he
do
hardly
get
no
rest
at
all
with
them
they
continued
looking
at
him
a
little
longer
ruth
thought
he
was
a
very
beautiful
child
he
would
be
eight
months
old
on
sunday
they
were
sorry
they
could
do
nothing
to
ease
his
pain
but
consoled
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
he
would
be
all
right
once
those
teeth
were
through
let
have
some
tea
said
easton
at
last
whilst
he
removed
his
wet
boots
and
socks
and
placed
them
in
front
of
the
fire
to
dry
and
put
on
dry
socks
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
their
stead
ruth
half
filled
a
tin
basin
with
hot
water
from
the
boiler
and
gave
it
to
him
and
he
then
went
to
the
scullery
added
some
cold
water
and
began
to
wash
the
paint
off
his
hands
this
done
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
at
the
table
could
think
what
to
give
you
to
eat
tonight
said
ruth
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
had
got
no
money
left
and
there
nothing
in
the
house
except
bread
and
butter
and
that
piece
of
cheese
so
i
cut
some
bread
and
butter
and
put
some
thin
slices
of
cheese
on
it
and
toasted
it
on
a
place
in
front
of
the
fire
i
hope
you
like
it
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
all
right
it
smells
very
nice
anyway
and
i
very
hungry
as
they
were
taking
their
tea
easton
told
his
wife
about
affair
and
his
apprehensions
as
to
what
might
befall
himself
they
were
both
very
indignant
and
sorry
for
poor
old
linden
but
their
sympathy
for
him
was
soon
forgotten
in
their
fears
for
their
own
immediate
future
they
remained
at
the
table
in
silence
for
some
time
then
much
rent
do
we
owe
now
asked
easton
weeks
and
i
promised
the
collector
the
last
time
he
called
that

monday
he
was
quite
nasty
about
it
i
suppose
you
have
to
pay
it
that
all
said
easton
much
money
will
you
have
tomorrow
asked
ruth
he
began
to
reckon
up
his
time
he
started
on
monday
and
today
was
friday
five
days
from
seven
to
five
less
half
an
hour

an
hour
for

eight
and
a

while

more
coal
there

about

said
easton
best

then
we
shall
know
exactly
where
we
are
you
get

a

see
what
it
all
comes
to
you
mean
everything
we
owe
or
everything
we
must
pay
tomorrow
think
we
better
make
a
list
of
all
we
owe
first
while
they
were
talking
the
baby
was
sleeping
restlessly
occasionally
uttering
plaintive
little
cries
the
mother
now
went
and
knelt
at
the
side
of
the
cradle
which
she
gently
rocked
with
one
hand
patting
the
infant
with
the
other
the
furniture
people
the
biggest
thing
we
owe
is
the
rent
she
said
when
easton
was
ready
to
begin
seems
to
me
said
he
as
after
having
cleared
a
space
on
the
table
and
arranged
the
paper
he
began
to
sharpen
his
pencil
with
a
you
do
manage
things
as
well
as
you
might
if
you
was
to
make
a
list
of
just
the
things
you
must
have
before
you
went
out
of
a
saturday
you
find
the
money
would
go
much
farther
instead
of
doing
that
you
just
take
the
money
in
your
hand
without
knowing
exactly
what
you
going
to
do
with
it
and
when
you
come
back
all
gone
and
next
to
nothing
to
show
for
it
his
wife
made
no
reply
her
head
was
bent
over
the
child
let
see

easton

and

handed
them
to
him

i
did

the
second
communication
was
dated
from
the
office
of
the
assistant
overseer
of
the
poor
it
was
also
a
final
notice
and
was
worded
in
almost
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
other
the
principal
difference
being
that
it
was
order
of
the
overseers
instead
of
council
it
demanded
the
sum
of

rate
within

days
and
threatened

easton
laid
this
down
and
began
to
read
the
third
letter
didlum
co
ltd
complete
house
furnishers
quality
street
mugsborough
mr
easton
sir
we
have
to
remind
you
that
three
monthly
payments
of
four
shillings
each
in
all
became
due
on
the
first
of
this
month
and
we
must
request
you
to
let
us
have
this
amount
by
return
of
post
under
the
terms
of
your
agreement
you
guaranteed
that
the
money
should
be
paid
on

to
prevent
unpleasantness
we
must
request
you
for
the
future
to
forward
the
full
amount
punctually
upon
that
day
yours
truly
didlum
ltd
he
read
these
communications
several
times
in
silence
and
finally
with
an
oath
threw
them
down
on
the
table
much
do
we
still
owe
for
the
oilcloth
and
the
furniture
he
asked
do
know
exactly
it
was
seven
pound
odd
and
we
had
the
things
about
six
months
we
paid
one
pound
down
and
three
or
four
instalments
i
get
the
card
if
you
like
never
mind
say
we
paid
one
pound
twelve
so
we
still
owe
about
six
pound
he
added
this
amount
to
the
list
think
it
a
great
pity
we
ever
had
the
things
at
all
he
said
peevishly
would
have
been
better
to
have
gone
without
until
we
could
pay
cash
for
them
but
you
would
have
your
way
of
course
now
we
have
this
bloody
debt
dragging
on
us
for
years
and
before
the
dam
stuff
is
paid
for
it
be
worn
out
the
woman
did
not
reply
at
once
she
was
bending
down
over
the
cradle
arranging
the
coverings
which
the
restless
movements
of
the
child
had
disordered
she
was
crying
silently
unnoticed
by
her
husband
for
months
past
in
fact
ever
since
the
child
was
born
she
had
been
existing
without
sufficient
food
if
easton
was
unemployed
they
had
to
stint
themselves
so
as
to
avoid
getting
further
into
debt
than
was
absolutely
necessary
when
he
was
working
they
had
to
go
short
in
order
to
pay
what
they
owed
but
of
what
there
was
easton
himself
without
knowing
it
always
had
the
greater
share
if
he
was
at
work
she
would
pack
into
his
dinner
basket
overnight
the
best
there
was
in
the
house
when
he
was
out
of
work
she
often
pretended
as
she
gave
him
his
meals
that
she
had
had
hers
while
he
was
out
and
all
the
time
the
baby
was
draining
her
life
away
and
her
work
was
never
done
she
felt
very
weak
and
weary
as
she
crouched
there
crying
furtively
and
trying
not
to
let
him
see
at
last
she
said
without
looking
round
know
quite
well
that
you
were
just
as
much
in
favour
of
getting
them
as
i
was
if
we
had
got
the
oilcloth
there
would
have
been
illness
in
the
house
because
of
the
way
the
wind
used
to
come
up
between
the
floorboards
even
now
of
a
windy
day
the
oilcloth
moves
up
and
down
i
sure
i
do
know
said
easton
as
he
looked
alternatively
at
the
list
of
debts
and
the
three
letters
give
you
nearly
every
farthing
i
earn
and
i
never
interfere
about
anything
because
i
think
it
your
part
to
attend
to
the
house
but
it
seems
to
me
you
manage
things
properly
the
woman
suddenly
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
laying
her
head
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
that
was
standing
near
the
cradle
easton
started
up
in
surprise
what
the
matter
he
said
then
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
quivering
form
of
the
sobbing
woman
he
was
ashamed
he
knelt
down
by
her
embracing
her
and
apologizing
protesting
that
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
her
like
that
always
do
the
best
i
can
with
the
money
ruth
sobbed
never
spend
a
farthing
on
myself
but
you
do
seem
to
understand
how
hard
it
is
i
do
care
nothing
about
having
to
go
without
things
myself
but
i
ca
bear
it
when
you
speak
to
me
like
you
do
lately
you
seem
to
blame
me
for
everything
you
use
to
speak
to
me
like
that
before
i
before
oh
i
am
so
tired
i
am
so
tired
i
wish
i
could
lie
down
somewhere
and
sleep
and
never
wake
up
any
more
she
turned
away
from
him
half
kneeling
half
sitting
on
the
floor
her
arms
folded
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
her
head
resting
upon
them
she
was
crying
in
a
heartbroken
helpless
way
sorry
i
spoke
to
you
like
that
said
easton
awkwardly
did
mean
what
i
said
it
all
my
fault
i
leave
things
too
much
to
you
and
it
more
than
you
can
be
expected
to
manage
i
help
you
to
think
things
out
in
future
only
forgive
me
i
very
sorry
i
know
you
try
your
best
she
suffered
him
to
draw
her
to
him
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
as
he
kissed
and
fondled
her
protesting
that
he
would
rather
be
poor
and
hungry
with
her
than
share
riches
with
anyone
else
the
child
in
the
cradle
who
had
been
twisting
and
turning
restlessly
all
this
time
now
began
to
cry
loudly
the
mother
took
it
from
the
cradle
and
began
to
hush
and
soothe
it
walking
about
the
room
and
rocking
it
in
her
arms
the
child
however
continued
to
scream
so
she
sat
down
to
nurse
it
for
a
little
while
the
infant
refused
to
drink
struggling
and
kicking
in
its
mother
arms
then
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
quite
taking
the
milk
in
a
fretful
way
then
it
began
to
scream
and
twist
and
struggle
they
both
looked
at
it
in
a
helpless
manner
whatever
could
be
the
matter
with
it
it
must
be
those
teeth
then
suddenly
as
they
were
soothing
and
patting
him
the
child
vomited
all
over
its
own
and
its
mother
clothing
a
mass
of
undigested
food
mingled
with
the
curdled
milk
were
fragments
of
egg
little
bits
of
bacon
bread
and
particles
of
potato
having
rid
his
stomach
of
this
unnatural
burden
the
unfortunate
baby
began
to
cry
afresh
his
face
very
pale
his
lips
colourless
and
his
eyes
and
running
with
water
easton
walked
about
with
him
while
ruth
cleaned
up
the
mess
and
got
ready
some
fresh
clothing
they
both
agreed
that
it
was
the
coming
teeth
that
had
upset
the
poor
child
digestion
it
would
be
a
good
job
when
they
were
through
this
work
finished
easton
who
was
still
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
with
the
aid
of
a
little
common
sense
and
judicious
management
their
affairs
might
be
arranged
more
satisfactorily
said
may
as
well
make
a
list
of
all
the
things
we
must
pay
and
buy
tomorrow
the
great
thing
is
to
think
out
exactly
what
you
are
going
to
do
before
you
spend
anything
that
saves
you
from
getting
things
you
do
really
need
and
prevents
you
forgetting
the
things
you
must
have
now
first
of
all
the
rent
two
weeks
twelve
shillings
he
took
a
fresh
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
this
item
down
else
is
there
that
we
must
pay
or
buy
tomorrow
you
know
i
promised
the
baker
and
the
grocer
that
i
would
begin
to
pay
them
directly
you
got
a
job
and
if
i
do
keep
my
word
they
wo
let
us
have
anything
another
time
so
you
better
put
down
two
shillings
each
for
them
got
that
said
easton
and
seven
for
the
butcher
we
must
pay
that
i
ashamed
to
pass
the
shop
because
when
i
got
the
meat
i
promised
to
pay
him
the
next
week
and
it
nearly
three
weeks
ago
now
put
that
down
what
else
hundred
of
coal
one
and
six
instalment
for
the
furniture
and
twelve
shillings
owe
the
milkman
four
weeks
we
better
pay
one
week
on
account
that
one
and
two
greengrocer
one
shilling
on
account
else
shall
want
a
piece
of
meat
of
some
kind
we
had
none
for
nearly
three
weeks
you
better
say
one
and
six
for
that
down
and
nine
for
bread
that
one
loaf
a
day
i
got
two
shillings
down
for
bread
already
said
easton
i
know
dear
but
that
to
go
towards
paying
off
what
we
owe
and
what
you
have
down
for
the
grocer
and
milkman
the
same
go
on
for
christ
sake
and
let
get
it
down
said
easton
irritably
ca
say
less
than
three
shillings
for
groceries
easton
looked
carefully
at
his
list
this
time
he
felt
sure
that
the
item
was
already
down
but
finding
he
was
mistaken
he
said
nothing
and
added
the
amount
i
got
that
what
else
one
and
two
eightpence
oil
and
firewood
sixpence
again
the
financier
scrutinized
the
list
he
was
positive
that
it
was
down
already
however
he
could
not
find
it
so
the
sixpence
was
added
to
the
column
of
figures
there
your
boots
you
ca
go
about
with
them
old
things
in
this
weather
much
longer
and
they
wo
stand
mending
again
you
remember
the
old
man
said
they
were
not
worth
it
when
you
had
that
patch
put
on
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
thinking
of
buying
a
new
pair
tomorrow
my
socks
was
wet
through
tonight
if
it
raining
some
morning
when
i
going
out
and
i
have
to
work
all
day
with
wet
feet
i
shall
be
laid
up
that
shop
down
in
high
street
i
saw
when
i
was
out
this
afternoon
a
very
good
pair
just
your
size
for
two
shillings
easton
did
not
reply
at
once
he
did
not
much
fancy
wearing
the
boots
of
some
stranger
who
for
all
he
knew
might
have
suffered
from
some
disease
but
then
remembering
that
his
old
ones
were
literally
falling
off
his
feet
he
realized
that
he
had
practically
no
choice
you
quite
sure
they
fit
you
better
get
them
it
better
to
do
that
than
for
me
to
catch
cold
and
be
laid
up
for
god
knows
how
long
so
the
two
shillings
were
added
to
the
list
there
anything
else
much
does
it
all
come
to
now
asked
ruth
easton
added
it
all
up
when
he
had
finished
he
remained
staring
at
the
figures
in
consternation
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
christ
he
ejaculated
at
last
it
come
to
asked
ruth
and
tenpence
knew
we
would
have
enough
said
ruth
wearily
if
you
think
i
manage
so
badly
you
can
tell
me
which
of
these
things
we
ought
to
leave
out
be
all
right
if
it
was
for
the
debts
said
easton
doggedly
you
not
working
we
must
either
get
into
debt
or
starve
easton
made
no
answer
we
do
about
the
rates
asked
ruth
sure
i
do
know
there
nothing
left
to
pawn
except
my
black
coat
and
vest
you
might
get
something
on
that
have
to
be
paid
somehow
said
ruth
you
be
taken
off
to
jail
for
a
month
the
same
as
mrs
newman
husband
was
last
winter
you
better
take
the
coat
and
vest
and
see
what
you
can
get
on
tomorrow
said
ruth
there
that
brown
silk
dress
of
mine
you
know
the
one
i
wore
when
we
was
married
i
might
get
something
on
that
because
we
wo
get
enough
on
the
coat
and
vest
i
do
like
parting
with
the
dress
although
i
never
wear
it
but
we
be
sure
to
be
able
to
get
it
out
again
wo
we
course
said
easton
they
remained
silent
for
some
time
easton
staring
at
the
list
of
debts
and
the
letters
she
was
wondering
if
he
still
thought
she
managed
badly
and
what
he
would
do
about
it
she
knew
she
had
always
done
her
best
at
last
she
said
wistfully
trying
to
speak
plainly
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
lump
in
her
throat
what
about
tomorrow
would
you
like
to
spend
the
money
yourself
or
shall
i
manage
as
i
done
before
or
will
you
tell
me
what
to
do
do
know
dear
said
easton
sheepishly
think
you
better
do
as
you
think
best
i
manage
all
right
dear
you
see
replied
ruth
who
seemed
to
think
it
a
sort
of
honour
to
be
allowed
to
starve
herself
and
wear
shabby
clothes
the
baby
who
had
been
for
some
time
quietly
sitting
upon
his
lap
looking
wonderingly
at
the
fire
his
teeth
appeared
to
trouble
him
less
since
he
got
rid
of
the
eggs
and
bacon
and
potatoes
now
began
to
nod
and
doze
which
easton
perceiving
suggested
that
the
infant
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
sleep
with
an
empty
stomach
because
it
would
probably
wake
up
hungry
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
therefore
woke
him
up
as
much
as
possible
and
mashed
a
little
of
the
bread
and
toasted
cheese
with
a
little
warm
milk
then
taking
the
baby
from
ruth
he
began
to
try
to
induce
it
to
eat
as
soon
however
as
the
child
understood
his
object
it
began
to
scream
at
the
top
of
its
voice
closing
its
lips
firmly
and
turning
its
head
rapidly
from
side
to
side
every
time
the
spoon
approached
its
mouth
it
made
such
a
dreadful
noise
that
easton
at
last
gave
in
he
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
it
and
presently
the
child
sobbed
itself
to
sleep
after
putting
the
baby
into
its
cradle
ruth
set
about
preparing
easton
breakfast
and
packing
it
into
his
basket
this
did
not
take
very
long
there
being
only
bread
and
butter
or
to
be
more
correct
margarine
then
she
poured
what
tea
was
left
in
the
into
a
small
saucepan
and
placed
it
on
the
top
of
the
oven
but
away
from
the
fire
cut
two
more
slices
of
bread
and
spread
on
them
all
the
margarine
that
was
left
then
put
them
on
a
plate
on
the
table
covering
them
with
a
saucer
to
prevent
them
getting
hard
and
dry
during
the
night
near
the
plate
she
placed
a
clean
cup
and
saucer
and
the
milk
and
sugar
in
the
morning
easton
would
light
the
fire
and
warm
up
the
tea
in
the
saucepan
so
as
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
before
going
out
if
ruth
was
awake
and
he
was
not
pressed
for
time
he
generally
took
a
cup
of
tea
to
her
in
bed
nothing
now
remained
to
be
done
but
to
put
some
coal
and
wood
ready
in
the
fender
so
that
there
would
be
no
unnecessary
delay
in
the
morning
the
baby
was
still
sleeping
and
ruth
did
not
like
to
wake
him
up
yet
to
dress
him
for
the
night
easton
was
sitting
by
the
fire
smoking
so
everything
being
done
ruth
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
sewing
presently
she
spoke
wish
you
let
me
try
to
let
that
back
room
upstairs
the
woman
next
door
has
got
hers
let
unfurnished
to
an
elderly
woman
and
her
husband
for
two
shillings
a
week
if
we
could
get
someone
like
that
it
would
be
better
than
having
an
empty
room
in
the
house
we
always
have
them
messing
about
down
here
cooking
and
washing
and
one
thing
and
another
objected
easton
be
more
trouble
than
they
way
worth
we
might
try
and
furnish
it
there
mrs
crass
across
the
road
has
got
two
lodgers
in
one
room
they
pay
her
twelve
shillings
a
week
each
board
lodging
and
washing
that
one
pound
four
she
has
coming
in
reglar
every
week
if
we
could
do
the
same
we
very
soon
be
out
of
debt
the
good
of
talking
you
never
be
able
to
do
the
work
even
if
we
had
the
furniture
the
work
nothing
replied
ruth
as
for
the
furniture
we
got
plenty
of
spare
bedclothes
and
we
could
easily
manage
without
a
washstand
in
our
room
for
a
bit
so
the
only
thing
we
really
want
is
a
small
bedstead
and
mattress
we
could
get
them
very
cheap
ought
to
be
a
chest
of
drawers
said
easton
doubtfully
do
think
so
replied
ruth
a
cupboard
in
the
room
and
whoever
took
it
would
be
sure
to
have
a
box
if
you
think
you
can
do
the
work
i
no
objection
said
easton
be
a
nuisance
having
a
stranger
in
the
way
all
the
time
but
i
suppose
we
must
do
something
of
the
sort
or
else
we
have
to
give
up
the
house
and
take
a
couple
of
rooms
somewhere
that
would
be
worse
than
having
lodgers
ourselves
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
room
he
added
getting
up
and
taking
the
lamp
from
the
wall
they
had
to
go
up
two
flights
of
stairs
before
arriving
at
the
top
landing
where
there
were
two
doors
one
leading
into
the
front
room
their
bedroom
and
the
other
into
the
empty
back
room
these
two
doors
were
at
right
angles
to
each
other
the
wallpaper
in
the
back
room
was
damaged
and
soiled
in
several
places
nearly
a
whole
roll
of
this
paper
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
said
ruth
could
easily
mend
all
those
places
we
could
hang
up
a
few
almanacks
on
the
walls
our
washstand
could
go
there
by
the
window
a
chair
just
there
and
the
bed
along
that
wall
behind
the
door
only
a
small
window
so
i
could
easily
manage
to
make
a
curtain
out
of
something
i
sure
i
could
make
the
room
look
quite
nice
without
spending
hardly
anything
easton
reached
down
the
roll
of
paper
it
was
the
same
pattern
as
that
on
the
wall
the
latter
was
a
good
deal
faded
of
course
but
it
would
not
matter
much
if
the
patches
showed
a
little
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
you
think
you
know
anyone
who
would
take
it
asked
ruth
easton
smoked
thoughtfully
he
said
at
length
i
mention
it
to
one
or
two
of
the
chaps
on
the
job
they
might
know
of
someone
i
get
mrs
crass
to
ask
her
lodgers
they
might
have
a
friend
what
would
like
to
live
near
them
so
it
was
settled
and
as
the
fire
was
nearly
out
and
it
was
getting
late
they
prepared
to
retire
for
the
night
the
baby
was
still
sleeping
so
easton
lifted
it
cradle
and
all
and
carried
it
up
the
narrow
staircase
into
the
front
bedroom
ruth
leading
the
way
carrying
the
lamp
and
some
clothes
for
the
child
so
that
the
infant
might
be
within
easy
reach
of
its
mother
during
the
night
two
chairs
were
arranged
close
to
her
side
of
the
bed
and
the
cradle
placed
on
them
we
forgot
the
clock
said
easton
pausing
he
was
half
undressed
and
had
already
removed
his
slippers
slip
down
and
get
it
said
ruth
mind
i
go
said
easton
beginning
to
put
his
slippers
on
again
you
get
into
bed
i
not
started
undressing
yet
i
get
it
replied
ruth
who
was
already
on
her
way
down
do
know
as
it
was
worth
the
trouble
of
going
down
said
ruth
when
she
returned
with
the
clock
stopped
three
or
four
times
today
i
hope
it
do
stop
in
the
night
easton
said
would
be
a
bit
of
all
right
not
knowing
what
time
it
was
in
the
morning
i
suppose
the
next
thing
will
be
that
we
have
to
buy
a
new
clock
he
woke
several
times
during
the
night
and
struck
a
match
to
see
if
it
was
yet
time
to
get
up
at
half
past
two
the
clock
was
still
going
and
he
again
fell
asleep
the
next
time
he
work
up
the
ticking
had
ceased
he
wondered
what
time
it
was
it
was
still
very
dark
but
that
was
nothing
to
go
by
because
it
was
always
dark
at
six
now
he
was
wide
awake
it
must
be
nearly
time
to
get
up
it
would
never
do
to
be
late
he
might
get
the
sack
he
got
up
and
dressed
himself
ruth
was
asleep
so
he
crept
quietly
downstairs
lit
the
fire
and
heated
the
tea
when
it
was
ready
he
went
softly
upstairs
again
ruth
was
still
sleeping
so
he
decided
not
to
disturb
her
returning
to
the
kitchen
he
poured
out
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
put
on
his
boots
overcoat
and
hat
and
taking
his
basket
went
out
of
the
house
the
rain
was
still
falling
and
it
was
very
cold
and
dark
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
street
easton
shivered
as
he
walked
along
wondering
what
time
it
could
be
he
remembered
there
was
a
clock
over
the
front
of
a
jeweller
shop
a
little
way
down
the
main
road
when
he
arrived
at
this
place
he
found
that
the
clock
being
so
high
up
he
could
not
see
the
figures
on
the
face
distinctly
because
it
was
still
very
dark
he
stood
staring
for
a
few
minutes
vainly
trying
to
see
what
time
it
was
when
suddenly
the
light
of
a
lantern
was
flashed
into
his
eyes
about
very
early
said
a
voice
the
owner
of
which
easton
could
not
see
the
light
blinded
him
time
is
it
said
easton
got
to
get
to
work
at
seven
and
our
clock
stopped
during
the
night
are
you
working
the
cave
in
elmore
road
you
know
near
the
old
toll
gate
are
you
doing
there
and
who
are
you
working
for
the
policeman
demanded
easton
explained
said
the
constable
very
strange
that
you
should
be
wandering
about
at
this
hour
it
only
about
of
an
hour
walk
from
here
to
elmore
road
you
say
you
got
to
get
there
at
seven
and
it
only
a
quarter
to
four
now
where
do
you
live
what
your
name
easton
gave
his
name
and
address
and
began
repeating
the
story
about
the
clock
having
stopped
you
say
may
be
all
right
or
it
may
not
interrupted
the
policeman
not
sure
but
that
i
ought
to
take
you
to
the
station
all
i
know
about
you
is
that
i
find
you
loitering
outside

the
policeman

a
pause
to

sure

my

i
do

you

but
i
should
advise
you
to
buy
a
decent
clock
or
you
be
getting
yourself
into
trouble
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
easton
opened
the
door
and
after
making
some
entries
in
his
the
officer
went
away
much
to
the
relief
of
easton
who
went
upstairs
set
the
hands
of
the
clock
right
and
started
it
going
again
he
then
removed
his
overcoat
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
in
his
clothes
covering
himself
with
the
quilt
after
a
while
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
the
clock
was
still
ticking
the
time
was
exactly
seven
chapter
the
placard
frank
owen
was
the
son
of
a
journeyman
carpenter
who
had
died
of
consumption
when
the
boy
was
only
five
years
old
after
that
his
mother
earned
a
scanty
living
as
a
when
frank
was
thirteen
he
went
to
work
for
a
master
decorator
who
was
a
man
of
a
type
that
has
now
almost
disappeared
being
not
merely
an
employer
but
a
craftsman
of
a
high
order
he
was
an
old
man
when
frank
owen
went
to
work
for
him
at
one
time
he
had
had
a
good
business
in
the
town
and
used
to
boast
that
he
had
always
done
good
work
had
found
pleasure
in
doing
it
and
had
been
well
paid
for
it
but
of
late
years
the
number
of
his
customers
had
dwindled
considerably
for
there
had
arisen
a
new
generation
which
cared
nothing
about
craftsmanship
or
art
and
everything
for
cheapness
and
profit
from
this
man
and
by
laborious
study
and
practice
in
his
spare
time
aided
by
a
certain
measure
of
natural
ability
the
boy
acquired
a
knowledge
of
decorative
painting
and
design
and
graining
and
signwriting
frank
mother
died
when
he
was
and
a
year
afterwards
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
fellow
workman
in
those
days
trade
was
fairly
good
and
although
there
was
not
much
demand
for
the
more
artistic
kinds
of
work
still
the
fact
that
he
was
capable
of
doing
them
if
required
made
it
comparatively
easy
for
him
to
obtain
employment
owen
and
his
wife
were
very
happy
they
had
one
child
a
boy
and
for
some
years
all
went
well
but
gradually
this
state
of
things
altered
broadly
speaking
the
change
came
slowly
and
imperceptibly
although
there
were
occasional
sudden
fluctuations
even
in
summer
he
could
not
always
find
work
and
in
winter
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
a
job
of
any
sort
at
last
about
twelve
months
before
the
date
that
this
story
opens
he
determined
to
leave
his
wife
and
child
at
home
and
go
to
try
his
fortune
in
london
when
he
got
employment
he
would
send
for
them
it
was
a
vain
hope
he
found
london
if
anything
worse
than
his
native
town
wherever
he
went
he
was
confronted
with
the
legend
hands
wanted
he
walked
the
streets
day
after
day
pawned
or
sold
all
his
clothes
save
those
he
stood
in
and
stayed
in
london
for
six
months
sometimes
starving
and
only
occasionally
obtaining
a
few
days
or
weeks
work
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
forced
to
give
in
the
privations
he
had
endured
the
strain
on
his
mind
and
the
foul
atmosphere
of
the
city
combined
to
defeat
him
symptoms
of
the
disease
that
had
killed
his
father
began
to
manifest
themselves
and
yielding
to
the
repeated
entreaties
of
his
wife
he
returned
to
his
native
town
the
shadow
of
his
former
self
that
was
six
months
ago
and
since
then
he
had
worked
for
rushton
co
occasionally
when
they
had
no
work
in
hand
he
was
off
until
something
came
in
ever
since
his
return
from
london
owen
had
been
gradually
abandoning
himself
to
hopelessness
every
day
he
felt
that
the
disease
he
suffered
from
was
obtaining
a
stronger
grip
on
him
the
doctor
told
him
to
plenty
of
nourishing
food
and
prescribed
costly
medicines
which
owen
had
not
the
money
to
buy
then
there
was
his
wife
naturally
delicate
she
needed
many
things
that
he
was
unable
to
procure
for
her
and
the
boy
what
hope
was
there
for
him
often
as
owen
moodily
thought
of
their
circumstances
and
prospects
he
told
himself
that
it
would
be
far
better
if
they
could
all
three
die
now
together
he
was
tired
of
suffering
himself
tired
of
impotently
watching
the
sufferings
of
his
wife
and
appalled
at
the
thought
of
what
was
in
store
for
the
child
of
this
nature
were
his
reflections
as
he
walked
homewards
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
old
linden
was
dismissed
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
or
hope
that
the
existing
state
of
things
would
be
altered
for
a
long
time
to
come
thousands
of
people
like
himself
dragged
out
a
wretched
existence
on
the
very
verge
of
starvation
and
for
the
greater
number
of
people
life
was
one
long
struggle
against
poverty
yet
practically
none
of
these
people
knew
or
even
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
why
they
were
in
that
condition
and
for
anyone
else
to
try
to
explain
to
them
was
a
ridiculous
waste
of
time
for
they
did
not
want
to
know
the
remedy
was
so
simple
the
evil
so
great
and
so
glaringly
evident
that
the
only
possible
explanation
of
its
continued
existence
was
that
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workers
were
devoid
of
the
power
of
reasoning
if
these
people
were
not
mentally
deficient
they
would
of
their
own
accord
have
swept
this
silly
system
away
long
ago
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
anyone
to
teach
them
that
it
was
wrong
why
even
those
who
were
successful
or
wealthy
could
not
be
sure
that
they
would
not
eventually
die
of
want
in
every
workhouse
might
be
found
people
who
had
at
one
time
occupied
good
positions
and
their
downfall
was
not
in
every
case
their
own
fault
no
matter
how
prosperous
a
man
might
be
he
could
not
be
certain
that
his
children
would
never
want
for
bread
there
were
thousands
living
in
misery
on
starvation
wages
whose
parents
had
been
wealthy
people
as
owen
strode
rapidly
along
his
mind
filled
with
these
thoughts
he
was
almost
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
wet
through
to
the
skin
he
was
without
an
overcoat
it
was
pawned
in
london
and
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
redeem
it
his
boots
were
leaky
and
sodden
with
mud
and
rain
he
was
nearly
home
now
at
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
he
lived
there
was
a
newsagent
shop
and
on
a
board
outside
the
door
was
displayed
a
placard
terrible
domestic
tragedy
double
murder
and
suicide
he
went
in
to
buy
a
copy
of
the
paper
he
was
a
frequent
customer
here
and
as
he
entered
the
shopkeeper
greeted
him
by
name
weather
he
remarked
as
he
handed
owen
the
paper
makes
things
pretty
bad
in
your
line
i
suppose
responded
owen
a
lot
of
men
idle
but
fortunately
i
happen
to
be
working
inside
one
of
the
lucky
ones
then
said
the
other
know
there
be
a
job
here
for
some
of
as
soon
as
the
weather
gets
a
little
better
all
the
outside
of
this
block
is
going
to
be
done
up
that
a
pretty
big
job
is
it
returned
owen
going
to
do
it
and
sloggit
you
know
they
got
a
place
over
at
windley
i
know
the
firm
said
owen
grimly
he
had
worked
for
them
once
or
twice
himself
foreman
was
in
here
today
the
shopkeeper
went
on
said
they
going
to
make
a
start
monday
morning
if
it
fine
i
hope
it
will
be
said
owen
things
are
very
quiet
just
now
wishing
the
other
night
owen
again
proceeded
homewards
down
the
street
he
paused
irresolutely
he
was
thinking
of
the
news
he
had
just
heard
and
of
jack
linden
as
soon
as
it
became
generally
known
that
this
work
was
about
to
be
started
there
was
sure
to
be
a
rush
for
it
and
it
would
be
a
case
of
first
come
first
served
if
he
saw
jack
tonight
the
old
man
might
be
in
time
to
secure
a
job
owen
hesitated
he
was
wet
through
it
was
a
long
way
to
place
nearly
twenty
minutes
walk
still
he
would
like
to
let
him
know
because
unless
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
apply
linden
would
not
stand
such
a
good
chance
as
a
younger
man
owen
said
to
himself
that
if
he
walked
very
fast
there
was
not
much
risk
of
catching
cold
standing
about
in
wet
clothes
might
be
dangerous
but
so
long
as
one
kept
moving
it
was
all
right
he
turned
back
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
linden
house
although
he
was
but
a
few
yards
from
his
own
home
he
decided
not
to
go
in
because
his
wife
would
be
sure
to
try
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
out
again
as
he
hurried
along
he
presently
noticed
a
small
dark
object
on
the
doorstep
of
an
untenanted
house
he
stopped
to
examine
it
more
closely
and
perceived
that
it
was
a
small
black
kitten
the
tiny
creature
came
towards
him
and
began
walking
about
his
feet
looking
into
his
face
and
crying
piteously
he
stooped
down
and
stroked
it
shuddering
as
his
hands
came
in
contact
with
its
emaciated
body
its
fur
was
saturated
with
rain
and
every
joint
of
its
backbone
was
distinctly
perceptible
to
the
touch
as
he
caressed
it
the
starving
creature
mewed
pathetically
owen
decided
to
take
it
home
to
the
boy
and
as
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
inside
his
coat
the
little
outcast
began
to
purr
this
incident
served
to
turn
his
thoughts
into
another
channel
if
as
so
many
people
pretended
to
believe
there
was
an
infinitely
loving
god
how
was
it
that
this
helpless
creature
that
he
had
made
was
condemned
to
suffer
it
had
never
done
any
harm
and
was
in
no
sense
responsible
for
the
fact
that
it
existed
was
god
unaware
of
the
miseries
of
his
creatures
if
so
then
he
was
not
was
god
aware
of
their
sufferings
but
unable
to
help
them
then
he
was
not
had
he
the
power
but
not
the
will
to
make
his
creatures
happy
then
he
was
not
good
no
it
was
impossible
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
individual
infinite
in
fact
no
one
did
so
believe
and
least
of
all
those
who
pretended
for
various
reasons
to
be
the
disciples
and
followers
of
christ
the
who
went
about
singing
hymns
making
long
prayers
and
crying
lord
lord
but
never
doing
the
things
which
he
said
who
were
known
by
their
words
to
be
unbelievers
and
infidels
unfaithful
to
the
master
they
pretended
to
serve
their
lives
being
passed
in
deliberate
and
systematic
disregard
of
his
teachings
and
commandments
it
was
not
necessary
to
call
in
the
evidence
of
science
or
to
refer
to
the
supposed
inconsistencies
impossibilities
contradictions
and
absurdities
contained
in
the
bible
in
order
to
prove
there
was
no
truth
in
the
christian
religion
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
look
at
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
who
were
its
votaries
chapter
the
jack
linden
lived
in
a
small
cottage
in
windley
he
had
occupied
this
house
ever
since
his
marriage
over
thirty
years
ago
his
home
and
garden
were
his
hobby
he
was
always
doing
something
painting
whitewashing
papering
and
so
forth
the
result
was
that
although
the
house
itself
was
not
of
much
account
he
had
managed
to
get
it
into
very
good
order
and
as
a
result
it
was
very
clean
and
comfortable
another
result
of
his
industry
was
that
seeing
the
improved
appearance
of
the
place
the
landlord
had
on
two
occasions
raised
the
rent
when
linden
first
took
the
house
the
rent
was
six
shillings
a
week
five
years
after
it
was
raised
to
seven
shillings
and
after
the
lapse
of
another
five
years
it
had
been
increased
to
eight
shillings
during
the
thirty
years
of
his
tenancy
he
had
paid
altogether
nearly
six
hundred
pounds
in
rent
more
than
double
the
amount
of
the
present
value
of
the
house
jack
did
not
complain
of
this
in
fact
he
was
very
well
satisfied
he
often
said
that
mr
sweater
was
a
very
good
landlord
because
on
several
occasions
when
being
out
of
work
he
had
been
a
few
weeks
behind
with
his
rent
the
agent
acting
for
the
benevolent
mr
sweater
had
allowed
linden
to
pay
off
the
arrears
by
instalments
as
old
jack
was
in
the
habit
of
remarking
many
a
landlord
would
have
sold
up
their
furniture
and
turned
them
into
the
street
as
the
reader
is
already
aware
linden
household
consisted
of
his
wife
his
two
grandchildren
and
his
the
widow
and
children
of
his
youngest
son
a
reservist
who
died
while
serving
in
the
south
african
war
this
man
had
been
a
plasterer
and
just
before
the
war
he
was
working
for
rushton
co
they
had
just
finished
their
tea
when
owen
knocked
at
their
front
door
the
young
woman
went
to
see
who
was
there
mr
linden
in
who
is
it
name
owen
old
jack
however
had
already
recognized
owen
voice
and
came
to
the
door
wondering
what
he
wanted
i
was
going
home
i
heard
that
makehaste
and
sloggit
are
going
to
start
a
large
job
on
monday
so
i
thought
i
run
over
and
let
you
know
they
said
linden
go
and
see
them
in
the
morning
but
i
afraid
i
wo
stand
much
chance
because
a
lot
of
their
regular
hands
are
waiting
for
a
job
but
i
go
and
see
all
the
same
you
know
it
a
big
job
all
the
outside
of
that
block
at
the
corner
of
kerk
street
and
lord
street
they
almost
sure
to
want
a
few
extra
hands
there
something
in
that
said
linden
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
letting
me
know
but
come
in
out
of
the
rain
you
must
be
wet
through
i
wo
stay
responded
owen
do
want
to
stand
about
any
longer
than
i
can
help
in
these
wet
clothes
it
wo
take
you
a
minit
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
linden
insisted
wo
ask
you
to
stop
longer
than
that
owen
entered
the
old
man
closed
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
at
one
side
of
the
fire
linden
wife
a
old
lady
with
white
hair
was
seated
in
a
large
armchair
knitting
linden
sat
down
in
a
similar
chair
on
the
other
side
the
two
grandchildren
a
boy
and
girl
about
seven
and
eight
years
respectively
were
still
seated
at
the
table
standing
by
the
side
of
the
dresser
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
treadle
sewing
machine
and
on
one
end
of
the
dresser
was
a
a
pile
of
sewing
ladies
blouses
in
process
of
making
this
was
another
instance
of
the
goodness
of
mr
sweater
from
whom
obtained
the
work
it
was
not
much
because
she
was
only
able
to
do
it
in
her
spare
time
but
then
as
she
often
remarked
every
little
helped
the
floor
was
covered
with
linoleum
there
were
a
number
of
framed
pictures
on
the
walls
and
on
the
high
mantelshelf
were
a
number
of
brightly
polished
tins
and
copper
utensils
the
room
had
that
indescribably
homelike
cosy
air
that
is
found
only
in
those
houses
in
which
the
inhabitants
have
dwelt
for
a
very
long
time
the
younger
woman
was
already
pouring
out
a
cup
of
tea
old
mrs
linden
who
had
never
seen
owen
before
although
she
had
heard
of
him
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
and
was
intensely
religious
she
looked
curiously
at
the
atheist
as
he
entered
the
room
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
not
repulsive
to
look
at
rather
the
contrary
but
then
she
remembered
that
satan
often
appears
as
an
angel
of
light
appearances
are
deceitful
she
wished
that
john
had
not
asked
him
into
the
house
and
hoped
that
no
evil
consequences
would
follow
as
she
looked
at
him
she
was
horrified
to
perceive
a
small
black
head
with
a
pair
of
glistening
green
eyes
peeping
out
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
immediately
afterwards
the
kitten
catching
sight
of
the
cups
and
saucers
on
the
table
began
to
mew
frantically
and
scrambled
suddenly
out
of
its
shelter
inflicting
a
severe
scratch
on
owen
restraining
hands
as
it
jumped
to
the
floor
it
clambered
up
the
tablecloth
and
began
rushing
all
over
the
table
darting
madly
from
one
plate
to
another
seeking
something
to
eat
the
children
screamed
with
delight
their
grandmother
was
filled
with
a
feeling
of
superstitious
alarm
linden
and
the
young
woman
stood
staring
with
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
visitor
before
the
kitten
had
time
to
do
any
damage
owen
caught
hold
of
it
and
despite
its
struggles
lifted
it
off
the
table
found
it
in
the
street
as
i
was
coming
along
he
said
seems
to
be
starving
little
thing
i
give
it
something
exclaimed
the
young
woman
she
put
some
milk
and
bread
into
a
saucer
for
it
and
the
kitten
ate
ravenously
almost
upsetting
the
saucer
in
its
eagerness
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
two
children
who
stood
by
watching
it
admiringly
their
mother
now
handed
owen
a
cup
of
tea
linden
insisted
on
his
sitting
down
and
then
began
to
talk
about
hunter
know
i
had
to
spend
some
time
on
them
doors
to
make
look
anything
at
all
but
it
was
the
time
i
took
or
even
the
smoking
what
made
go
on
like
that
he
knows
very
well
the
time
it
takes
the
real
reason
is
that
he
thinks
i
was
gettin
too
much
money
work
is
done
so
rough
nowadays
that
chaps
like
sawkins
is
good
enough
for
most
of
it
hunter
shoved
me
off
just
because
i
was
getting
the
top
money
and
you
see
i
wo
be
the
only
one
afraid
you
right
returned
owen
you
see
rushton
when
you
went
for
your
money
replied
linden
hurried
up
as
fast
as
i
could
but
hunter
was
there
first
he
passed
me
on
his
bike
before
i
got
so
i
suppose
he
told
his
tale
before
i
came
anyway
when
i
started
to
speak
to
mr
rushton
he
would
listen
said
he
could
interfere
between
mr
hunter
and
the
men
they
a
bad
lot
them
two
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
sagely
it
all
come
to
you
see
never
prosper
the
lord
will
punish
them
owen
did
not
feel
very
confident
of
that
most
of
the
people
he
knew
who
had
prospered
were
very
similar
in
character
to
the
two
worthies
in
question
however
he
did
not
want
to
argue
with
this
poor
old
woman
tom
was
called
up
to
go
to
the
war
said
the
young
woman
bitterly
rushton
shook
hands
with
him
and
promised
to
give
him
a
job
when
he
came
back
but
now
that
poor
tom
gone
and
they
know
that
me
and
the
children
got
no
one
to
look
to
but
father
they
do
this
although
at
the
mention
of
her
dead
son
name
old
mrs
linden
was
evidently
distressed
she
was
still
mindful
of
the
atheist
presence
and
hastened
to
rebuke
her
should
say
we
got
no
one
to
look
to
mary
she
said
not
as
them
who
are
without
god
and
without
hope
in
the
world
the
lord
is
our
shepherd
he
careth
for
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
owen
was
very
doubtful
about
this
also
he
had
seen
so
many
badly
children
about
the
streets
lately
and
what
he
remembered
of
his
own
sorrowful
childhood
was
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
an
awkward
silence
succeeded
owen
did
not
wish
to
continue
this
conversation
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
say
something
that
would
hurt
the
old
woman
besides
he
was
anxious
to
get
away
he
began
to
feel
cold
in
his
wet
clothes
as
he
put
his
empty
cup
on
the
table
he
said
i
must
be
going
they
be
thinking
i
lost
at
home
the
kitten
had
finished
all
the
bread
and
milk
and
was
gravely
washing
its
face
with
one
of
its
forepaws
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
two
children
who
were
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
it
it
was
an
kitten
all
black
with
a
very
large
head
and
a
very
small
body
it
reminded
owen
of
a
tadpole
you
like
cats
he
asked
addressing
the
children
said
the
boy
it
to
us
will
you
mister
do
leave
it
mister
exclaimed
the
little
girl
look
after
it
will
i
said
the
boy
have
you
one
of
your
own
asked
owen
we
got
a
big
one
if
you
have
one
already
and
i
give
you
this
then
you
have
two
cats
and
i
have
none
that
would
be
fair
would
it
you
can
a
lend
of
our
cat
for
a
little
while
if
you
give
us
this
kitten
said
the
boy
after
a
moment
thought
would
you
rather
have
the
kitten
it
would
play
our
cat
do
want
to
play
it
too
old
you
too
rough
with
it
returned
owen
it
ai
that
it
just
because
it
old
know
cats
is
just
the
same
as
people
explained
the
little
girl
wisely
they
grown
up
i
suppose
they
got
their
troubles
to
think
about
owen
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
her
troubles
commenced
as
he
gazed
at
these
two
little
orphans
he
thought
of
his
own
child
and
of
the
rough
and
thorny
way
they
would
all
three
have
to
travel
if
they
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
outlive
their
childhood
we
it
mister
repeated
the
boy
owen
would
have
liked
to
grant
the
children
request
but
he
wanted
the
kitten
himself
therefore
he
was
relieved
when
their
grandmother
exclaimed
do
want
no
more
cats
we
got
one
already
that
quite
enough
she
was
not
yet
quite
satisfied
in
her
mind
that
the
creature
was
not
an
incarnation
of
the
devil
but
whether
it
was
or
not
she
did
not
want
it
or
anything
else
of
owen
in
this
house
she
wished
he
would
go
and
take
his
kitten
or
his
familiar
or
whatever
it
was
with
him
no
good
could
come
of
his
being
there
was
it
not
written
in
the
word
any
man
love
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
let
him
be
anathema
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
anathema
meant
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
something
very
unpleasant
it
was
a
terrible
thing
that
this
blasphemer
who
as
she
had
heard
did
not
believe
there
was
a
hell
and
said
that
the
bible
was
not
the
word
of
god
should
be
here
in
the
house
sitting
on
one
of
their
chairs
drinking
from
one
of
their
cups
and
talking
to
their
children
the
children
stood
by
wistfully
when
owen
put
the
kitten
under
his
coat
and
rose
to
go
away
as
linden
prepared
to
accompany
him
to
the
front
door
owen
happening
to
notice
a
timepiece
standing
on
a
small
table
in
the
recess
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
exclaimed
a
very
nice
clock
it
all
right
ai
it
said
old
jack
with
a
touch
of
pride
tom
made
that
not
the
clock
itself
but
just
the
case
it
was
the
case
that
had
attracted
owen
attention
it
stood
about
two
feet
high
and
was
made
of
fretwork
in
the
form
of
an
indian
mosque
with
a
pointed
dome
and
pinnacles
it
was
a
very
beautiful
thing
and
must
have
cost
many
hours
of
patient
labour
said
the
old
woman
in
a
trembling
broken
voice
and
looking
at
owen
with
a
pathetic
expression
and
months
he
worked
at
it
and
no
one
ever
guessed
who
it
were
for
and
then
when
my
birthday
came
round
the
very
first
thing
i
saw
when
i
woke
up
in
the
morning
were
the
clock
standing
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
with
a
card
dear
mother
from
her
loving
son
tom
wishing
her
many
happy
birthdays
he
never
had
another
birthday
himself
because
just
five
months
afterwards
he
were
sent
out
to
africa
and
he
only
been
there
five
weeks
when
he
died
five
years
ago
come
the
fifteenth
of
next
month
owen
inwardly
regretting
that
he
had
unintentionally
broached
so
painful
a
subject
tried
to
think
of
some
suitable
reply
but
had
to
content
himself
with
murmuring
some
words
of
admiration
of
the
work
as
he
wished
her
good
night
the
old
woman
looking
at
him
could
not
help
observing
that
he
appeared
very
frail
and
ill
his
face
was
very
thin
and
pale
and
his
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
possibly
the
lord
in
his
infinite
loving
kindness
and
mercy
was
chastening
this
unhappy
castaway
in
order
that
he
might
bring
him
to
himself
after
all
he
was
not
altogether
bad
it
was
certainly
very
thoughtful
of
him
to
come
all
this
way
to
let
john
know
about
that
job
she
observed
that
he
had
no
overcoat
and
the
storm
was
still
raging
fiercely
outside
furious
gusts
of
wind
frequently
striking
the
house
and
shaking
it
to
its
very
foundations
the
natural
kindliness
of
her
character
asserted
itself
her
better
feelings
were
aroused
triumphing
momentarily
over
the
bigotry
of
her
religious
opinions
you
ai
got
no
overcoat
she
exclaimed
be
soaked
goin
in
this
rain
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
continued
that
old
one
of
yours
you
might
lend
him
that
it
would
be
better
than
nothing
but
owen
would
not
hear
of
this
he
thought
as
he
became
very
conscious
of
the
clammy
feel
of
his
saturated
clothing
that
he
could
not
get
much
wetter
than
he
already
was
linden
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
front
door
and
owen
once
more
set
out
on
his
way
homeward
through
the
storm
that
howled
around
like
a
wild
beast
hungry
for
its
prey
chapter
it
is
not
my
crime
owen
and
his
family
occupied
the
top
floor
of
a
house
that
had
once
been
a
large
private
dwelling
but
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
series
of
flats
it
was
situated
in
lord
street
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
town
at
one
time
this
had
been
a
most
aristocratic
locality
but
most
of
the
former
residents
had
migrated
to
the
newer
suburb
at
the
west
of
the
town
notwithstanding
this
fact
lord
street
was
still
a
most
respectable
neighbourhood
the
inhabitants
generally
being
of
a
very
superior
type
shop
assistants
barber
clerks
boarding
house
keepers
a
coal
merchant
and
even
two
retired
there
were
four
other
flats
in
the
house
in
which
owen
lived
no
the
basement
was
occupied
by
an
estate
agent
clerk
no
on
a
level
with
the
street
was
the
habitat
of
the
family
of
mr
trafaim
a
gentleman
who
wore
a
top
hat
boasted
of
his
french
descent
and
was
a
at
sweater
emporium
no
was
tenanted
by
an
insurance
agent
and
in
no
dwelt
a
traveller
lord
street
like
most
other
similar
neighbourhoods
supplied
a
striking
answer
to
those
futile
theorists
who
prate
of
the
equality
of
mankind
for
the
inhabitants
instinctively
formed
themselves
into
groups
the
more
superior
types
drawing
together
separating
themselves
from
the
inferior
and
rising
naturally
to
the
top
while
the
others
gathered
themselves
into
distinct
classes
grading
downwards
or
else
isolated
themselves
altogether
being
refused
admission
to
the
circles
they
desired
to
enter
and
in
their
turn
refusing
to
associate
with
their
inferiors
the
most
exclusive
set
consisted
of
the
families
of
the
coal
merchant
the
two
retired
and
mr
trafaim
whose
superiority
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
to
say
nothing
of
his
french
extraction
he
wore
in
addition
to
the
top
hat
aforesaid
a
frock
coat
and
a
pair
of
lavender
trousers
every
day
the
coal
merchant
and
the
jerry
builders
also
wore
top
hats
lavender
trousers
and
frock
coats
but
only
on
sundays
and
other
special
occasions
the
estate
agent
clerk
and
the
insurance
agent
though
excluded
from
the
higher
circle
belonged
to
another
select
coterie
from
which
they
excluded
in
their
turn
all
persons
of
inferior
rank
such
as
shop
assistants
or
barbers
the
only
individual
who
was
received
with
equal
cordiality
by
all
ranks
was
the
tallyman
traveller
but
whatever
differences
existed
amongst
them
regarding
each
other
social
standing
they
were
unanimous
on
one
point
at
least
they
were
indignant
at
owen
presumption
in
coming
to
live
in
such
a
refined
locality
this
low
fellow
this
common
workman
with
his
clothing
his
broken
boots
and
his
generally
shabby
appearance
was
a
disgrace
to
the
street
and
as
for
his
wife
she
was
not
much
better
because
although
whenever
she
came
out
she
was
always
neatly
dressed
yet
most
of
the
neighbours
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
had
been
wearing
the
same
white
straw
hat
all
the
time
she
had
been
there
in
fact
the
only
tolerable
one
of
the
family
was
the
boy
and
they
were
forced
to
admit
that
he
was
always
very
well
dressed
so
well
indeed
as
to
occasion
some
surprise
until
they
found
out
that
all
the
clothes
were
then
their
surprise
was
changed
into
a
somewhat
grudging
admiration
of
the
skill
displayed
mingled
with
contempt
for
the
poverty
which
made
its
exercise
necessary
the
indignation
of
the
neighbours
was
increased
when
it
became
known
that
owen
and
his
wife
were
not
christians
then
indeed
everyone
agreed
that
the
landlord
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
letting
the
top
flat
to
such
people
but
although
the
hearts
of
these
disciples
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jewish
carpenter
were
filled
with
uncharitableness
they
were
powerless
to
do
much
harm
the
landlord
regarded
their
opinion
with
indifference
all
he
cared
about
was
the
money
although
he
also
was
a
sincere
christian
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
let
the
top
flat
to
satan
himself
provided
he
was
certain
of
receiving
the
rent
regularly
the
only
one
upon
whom
the
christians
were
able
to
inflict
any
suffering
was
the
child
at
first
when
he
used
to
go
out
into
the
street
to
play
the
other
children
acting
on
their
instructions
refused
to
associate
with
him
or
taunted
him
with
his
parents
poverty
occasionally
he
came
home
heartbroken
and
in
tears
because
he
had
been
excluded
from
some
game
at
first
sometimes
the
mothers
of
some
of
the
children
used
to
come
out
with
a
comical
assumption
of
superiority
and
dignity
and
compel
their
children
to
leave
off
playing
with
frankie
and
some
other
poorly
dressed
children
who
used
to
play
in
that
street
these
females
were
usually
overdressed
and
wore
a
lot
of
jewellery
most
of
them
fancied
they
were
ladies
and
if
they
had
only
had
the
sense
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
other
people
might
possibly
have
shared
the
same
delusion
but
this
was
now
a
rare
occurrence
because
the
parents
of
the
other
children
found
it
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
to
prevent
their
youngsters
from
associating
with
those
of
inferior
rank
for
when
left
to
themselves
the
children
disregarded
all
such
distinctions
frequently
in
that
street
was
to
be
seen
the
appalling
spectacle
of
the
son
of
the
refined
and
fashionable
trafaim
dragging
along
a
cart
constructed
of
a
sugar
box
and
an
old
pair
of
perambulator
wheels
with
no
tyres
in
which
reposed
the
plebeian
frankie
owen
armed
with
a
whip
and
the
dowdy
daughter
of
a
barber
clerk
while
the
heir
of
the
coal
merchant
rushed
up
behind
owen
wife
and
little
son
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
living
room
this
room
was
about
twelve
feet
square
and
the
ceiling
which
was
low
and
irregularly
shaped
showing
in
places
the
formation
of
the
roof
had
been
decorated
by
owen
with
painted
ornaments
there
were
three
or
four
chairs
and
an
oblong
table
covered
with
a
clean
white
tablecloth
set
ready
for
tea
in
the
recess
at
the
right
of
fireplace
an
ordinary
open
grate
were
a
number
of
shelves
filled
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
books
most
of
which
had
been
bought
there
were
also
a
number
of
new
books
mostly
cheap
editions
in
paper
covers
over
the
back
of
a
chair
at
one
side
of
the
fire
was
hanging
an
old
suit
of
owen
and
some
underclothing
which
his
wife
had
placed
there
to
air
knowing
that
he
would
be
wet
through
by
the
time
he
arrived
home
the
woman
was
half
lying
on
a
couch
by
the
other
side
of
the
fire
she
was
very
thin
and
her
pale
face
bore
the
traces
of
much
physical
and
mental
suffering
she
was
sewing
a
task
which
her
reclining
position
rendered
somewhat
difficult
although
she
was
really
only
years
of
age
she
appeared
older
the
boy
who
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
playing
with
some
toys
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
mother
he
also
appeared
very
fragile
and
in
his
childish
face
was
reproduced
much
of
the
delicate
prettiness
which
she
had
once
possessed
his
feminine
appearance
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
his
yellow
hair
hung
in
long
curls
on
his
shoulders
the
pride
with
which
his
mother
regarded
this
long
hair
was
by
no
means
shared
by
frankie
himself
for
he
was
always
entreating
her
to
cut
it
off
presently
the
boy
stood
up
and
walking
gravely
over
to
the
window
looked
down
into
the
street
scanning
the
pavement
for
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
had
been
doing
this
at
intervals
for
the
last
hour
wonder
wherever
he
got
to
he
said
as
he
returned
to
the
fire
sure
i
do
know
returned
his
mother
he
had
to
work
overtime
know
i
been
thinking
lately
observed
frankie
after
a
pause
it
a
great
mistake
for
dad
to
go
out
working
at
all
i
believe
that
the
very
reason
why
we
so
poor
everyone
who
works
is
more
or
less
poor
dear
but
if
dad
did
go
out
to
work
we
be
even
poorer
than
we
are
now
we
should
have
nothing
to
eat
dad
says
that
the
people
who
do
nothing
get
lots
of
everything
and
it
quite
true
that
most
of
the
people
who
never
do
any
work
get
lots
of
everything
but
where
do
they
get
it
from
and
how
do
they
get
it
sure
i
do
know
replied
frankie
shaking
his
head
in
a
puzzled
fashion
dad
did
go
to
work
or
that
he
had
no
work
to
go
to
or
that
he
was
ill
and
not
able
to
do
any
work
then
we
have
no
money
to
buy
anything
how
should
we
get
on
then
sure
i
do
know
repeated
frankie
looking
round
the
room
in
a
thoughtful
manner
chairs
that
left
are
good
enough
to
sell
and
we
ca
sell
the
beds
or
your
sofa
but
you
might
pawn
my
velvet
suit
even
if
all
the
things
were
good
enough
to
sell
the
money
get
for
them
would
last
very
long
and
what
should
we
do
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
without
that
all
the
same
as
we
did
when
dad
was
in
london
how
do
the
people
who
never
do
any
work
manage
to
get
lots
of
money
then
added
frankie
there
lots
of
different
ways
for
instance
you
remember
when
dad
was
in
london
and
we
had
no
food
in
the
house
i
had
to
sell
the
easy
chair
frankie
nodded
he
said
remember
you
wrote
a
note
and
i
took
it
to
the
shop
and
afterwards
old
didlum
came
up
here
and
bought
it
and
then
his
cart
came
and
a
man
took
it
away
do
you
remember
how
much
he
gave
us
for
it
shillings
replied
frankie
promptly
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
details
of
the
transaction
having
often
heard
his
father
and
mother
discuss
it
when
we
saw
it
in
his
shop
window
a
little
while
afterwards
what
price
was
marked
on
it
shillings
well
that
one
way
of
getting
money
without
working
frankie
played
with
his
toys
in
silence
for
some
minutes
at
last
he
said
other
ways
people
who
have
some
money
already
get
more
in
this
way
they
find
some
people
who
have
no
money
and
say
to
them
come
and
work
for
us
then
the
people
who
have
the
money
pay
the
workers
just
enough
wages
to
keep
them
alive
whilst
they
are
at
work
then
when
the
things
that
the
working
people
have
been
making
are
finished
the
workers
are
sent
away
and
as
they
still
have
no
money
they
are
soon
starving
in
the
meantime
the
people
who
had
the
money
take
all
the
things
that
the
workers
have
made
and
sell
them
for
a
great
deal
more
money
than
they
gave
to
the
workers
for
making
them
that
another
way
of
getting
lots
of
money
without
doing
any
useful
work
is
there
no
way
to
get
rich
without
doing
such
things
as
that
not
possible
for
anyone
to
become
rich
without
cheating
other
people
about
our
schoolmaster
then
he
does
do
any
work
you
think
it
useful
and
and
also
very
hard
work
teaching
all
those
boys
every
day
i
do
think
i
should
like
to
have
to
do
it
i
suppose
what
he
does
is
some
use
said
frankie
thoughtfully
it
must
be
rather
hard
too
i
should
think
i
noticed
he
looks
a
bit
worried
sometimes
and
sometimes
he
gets
into
a
fine
old
wax
when
the
boys
do
pay
proper
attention
the
child
again
went
over
to
the
window
and
pulling
back
the
edge
of
the
blind
looked
down
the
deserted
rain
washed
street
about
the
vicar
he
remarked
as
he
returned
although
frankie
did
not
go
to
church
or
sunday
school
the
day
school
that
he
had
attended
was
that
attached
to
the
parish
church
and
the
vicar
was
in
the
habit
of
looking
in
occasionally
he
really
is
one
of
those
who
live
without
doing
any
necessary
work
and
of
all
the
people
who
do
nothing
the
vicar
is
one
of
the
very
worst
frankie
looked
up
at
his
mother
with
some
surprise
not
because
he
entertained
any
very
high
opinion
of
clergymen
in
general
for
having
been
an
attentive
listener
to
many
conversations
between
his
parents
he
had
of
course
assimilated
their
opinions
as
far
as
his
infant
understanding
permitted
but
because
at
the
school
the
scholars
were
taught
to
regard
the
gentleman
in
question
with
the
most
profound
reverence
and
respect
mum
he
asked
this
reason
dearie
you
know
that
all
the
beautiful
things
which
the
people
who
do
nothing
have
are
made
by
the
people
who
work
you
you
know
that
those
who
work
have
to
eat
the
very
worst
food
and
wear
the
very
worst
clothes
and
live
in
the
very
worst
homes
said
frankie
sometimes
they
have
nothing
to
eat
at
all
and
no
clothes
to
wear
except
rags
and
even
no
homes
to
live
in
repeated
the
child
the
vicar
goes
about
telling
the
idlers
that
it
quite
right
for
them
to
do
nothing
and
that
god
meant
them
to
have
nearly
everything
that
is
made
by
those
who
work
in
fact
he
tells
them
that
god
made
the
poor
for
the
use
of
the
rich
then
he
goes
to
the
workers
and
tells
them
that
god
meant
them
to
work
very
hard
and
to
give
all
the
good
things
they
make
to
those
who
do
nothing
and
that
they
should
be
very
thankful
to
god
and
to
the
idlers
for
being
allowed
to
have
even
the
very
worst
food
to
eat
and
the
rags
and
broken
boots
to
wear
he
also
tells
them
that
they
must
grumble
or
be
discontented
because
they
poor
in
this
world
but
that
they
must
wait
till
they
dead
and
then
god
will
reward
them
by
letting
them
go
to
a
place
called
heaven
frankie
laughed
what
about
the
idlers
he
asked
vicar
says
that
if
they
believe
everything
he
tells
them
and
give
him
some
of
the
money
they
make
out
of
the
workers
then
god
will
let
them
into
heaven
also
that
not
fair
doos
is
it
mum
said
frankie
with
some
indignation
would
be
if
it
were
true
but
then
you
see
it
not
true
it
ca
be
true
ca
it
mum
for
many
reasons
to
begin
with
the
vicar
does
believe
it
himself
he
only
pretends
to
for
instance
he
pretends
to
believe
the
bible
but
if
we
read
the
bible
we
find
that
jesus
said
that
god
is
our
father
and
that
all
the
people
in
the
world
are
his
children
all
brothers
and
sisters
but
the
vicar
says
that
although
jesus
said
brothers
and
sisters
he
really
ought
to
have
said
masters
and
servants
again
jesus
said
that
his
disciples
should
not
think
of
tomorrow
or
save
up
a
lot
of
money
for
themselves
but
they
should
be
unselfish
and
help
those
who
are
in
need
jesus
said
that
his
disciples
must
not
think
about
their
own
future
needs
at
all
because
god
will
provide
for
them
if
they
only
do
as
he
commands
but
the
vicar
says
that
is
all
nonsense
also
said
that
if
anyone
tried
to
do
his
disciples
harm
they
must
never
resist
but
forgive
those
who
injured
them
and
pray
god
to
forgive
them
also
but
the
vicar
says
this
is
all
nonsense
too
he
says
that
the
world
would
never
be
able
to
go
on
if
we
did
as
jesus
taught
the
vicar
teaches
that
the
way
to
deal
with
those
that
injure
us
is
to
have
them
put
into
prison
or
if
they
belong
to
some
other
country
to
take
guns
and
knives
and
murder
them
and
burn
their
houses
so
you
see
the
vicar
does
really
believe
or
do
any
of
the
things
that
jesus
said
he
only
pretends
why
does
he
pretend
and
go
about
talking
like
that
mum
what
does
he
do
it
for
he
wishes
to
live
without
working
himself
dear
do
the
people
know
he
only
pretending
of
them
do
most
of
the
idlers
know
that
what
the
vicar
says
is
not
true
but
they
pretend
to
believe
it
and
give
him
money
for
saying
it
because
they
want
him
to
go
on
telling
it
to
the
workers
so
that
they
will
go
on
working
and
keep
quiet
and
be
afraid
to
think
for
themselves
what
about
the
workers
do
they
believe
it
of
them
do
because
when
they
were
little
children
like
you
their
mothers
taught
them
to
believe
without
thinking
whatever
the
vicar
said
and
that
god
made
them
for
the
use
of
the
idlers
when
they
went
to
school
they
were
taught
the
same
thing
and
now
that
they
grown
up
they
really
believe
it
and
they
go
to
work
and
give
nearly
everything
they
make
to
the
idlers
and
have
next
to
nothing
left
for
themselves
and
their
children
that
the
reason
why
the
workers
children
have
very
bad
clothes
to
wear
and
sometimes
no
food
to
eat
and
that
how
it
is
that
the
idlers
and
their
children
have
more
clothes
than
they
need
and
more
food
than
they
can
eat
some
of
them
have
so
much
food
that
they
are
not
able
to
eat
it
they
just
waste
it
or
throw
it
away
i
grown
up
into
a
man
said
frankie
with
a
flushed
face
going
to
be
one
of
the
workers
and
when
we
made
a
lot
of
things
i
shall
stand
up
and
tell
the
others
what
to
do
if
any
of
the
idlers
come
to
take
our
things
away
they
get
something
they
wo
like
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
the
boy
began
gathering
up
the
toys
and
throwing
them
violently
one
by
one
into
the
box
teach
to
come
taking
our
things
away
he
exclaimed
relapsing
momentarily
into
his
street
style
of
speaking
of
all
we
all
stand
quietly
on
one
side
then
when
the
idlers
come
in
and
start
touching
our
things
we
go
up
to
and
say
watcher
doin
of
just
you
put
it
down
will
yer
and
if
they
do
put
it
down
at
once
it
be
the
worse
for
i
can
tell
you
all
the
toys
being
collected
frankie
picked
up
the
box
and
placed
it
noisily
in
its
accustomed
corner
of
the
room
should
think
the
workers
will
be
jolly
glad
when
they
see
me
coming
to
tell
them
what
to
do
should
you
mum
do
know
dear
you
see
so
many
people
have
tried
to
tell
them
but
they
wo
listen
they
do
want
to
hear
they
think
it
quite
right
that
they
should
work
very
hard
all
their
lives
and
quite
right
that
most
of
the
things
they
help
to
make
should
be
taken
away
from
them
by
the
people
who
do
nothing
the
workers
think
that
their
children
are
not
as
good
as
the
children
of
the
idlers
and
they
teach
their
children
that
as
soon
as
ever
they
are
old
enough
they
must
be
satisfied
to
work
very
hard
and
to
have
only
very
bad
good
and
clothes
and
homes
i
should
think
the
workers
ought
to
be
jolly
ashamed
of
themselves
mum
do
you
in
one
sense
they
ought
but
you
must
remember
that
that
what
they
always
been
taught
themselves
first
their
mothers
and
fathers
told
them
so
then
their
schoolteachers
told
them
so
and
then
when
they
went
to
church
the
vicar
and
the
sunday
school
teacher
told
them
the
same
thing
so
you
ca
be
surprised
that
they
now
really
believe
that
god
made
them
and
their
children
to
make
things
for
the
use
of
the
people
who
do
nothing
you
think
their
own
sense
would
tell
them
how
can
it
be
right
for
the
people
who
do
nothing
to
have
the
very
best
and
most
of
everything
thats
made
and
the
very
ones
who
make
everything
to
have
hardly
any
why
even
i
know
better
than
that
and
i
only
six
and
a
half
years
old
then
you
different
dearie
you
been
taught
to
think
about
it
and
dad
and
i
have
explained
it
to
you
often
i
know
replied
frankie
confidently
even
if
you
never
taught
me
i
sure
i
should
have
tumbled
to
it
all
right
by
myself
i
not
such
a
juggins
as
you
think
i
am
you
might
but
you
would
if
you
been
brought
up
in
the
same
way
as
most
of
the
workers
they
been
taught
that
it
very
wicked
to
use
their
own
judgement
or
to
think
and
their
children
are
being
taught
so
now
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
the
other
day
when
you
came
home
from
school
about
the
scripture
lesson
st
thomas
what
did
the
teacher
say
st
thomas
was
said
he
was
a
bad
example
and
she
said
i
was
worse
than
him
because
i
asked
too
many
foolish
questions
she
always
gets
in
a
wax
if
i
talk
too
much
why
did
she
call
st
thomas
a
bad
example
he
would
believe
what
he
was
told
well
when
you
told
dad
about
it
what
did
he
say
told
me
that
really
st
thomas
was
the
only
sensible
man
in
the
whole
crowd
of
apostles
that
is
added
frankie
correcting
himself
there
ever
was
such
a
man
at
all
did
dad
say
that
there
never
was
such
a
man
he
said
he
did
believe
there
ever
was
but
he
told
me
to
just
listen
to
what
the
teacher
said
about
such
things
and
then
to
think
about
it
in
my
own
mind
and
wait
till
i
grown
up
and
then
i
can
use
my
own
judgement
now
that
what
you
were
told
but
all
the
other
mothers
and
fathers
tell
them
to
believe
without
thinking
whatever
the
teacher
says
so
it
will
be
no
wonder
if
those
children
are
not
able
to
think
for
themselves
when
they
grown
up
will
it
you
think
it
will
be
any
use
then
for
me
to
tell
them
what
to
do
to
the
idlers
asked
frankie
dejectedly
said
his
mother
holding
up
her
finger
cried
frankie
rushing
to
the
door
and
flinging
it
open
he
ran
along
the
passage
and
opened
the
staircase
door
before
owen
reached
the
top
of
the
last
flight
of
stairs
ever
do
you
come
up
at
such
a
rate
reproachfully
exclaimed
owen
wife
as
he
came
into
the
room
exhausted
from
the
climb
upstairs
and
sank
panting
into
the
nearest
chair
he
replied
when
he
had
in
some
degree
recovered
as
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
his
face
haggard
and
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
and
with
the
water
dripping
from
his
saturated
clothing
owen
presented
a
terrible
appearance
frankie
noticed
with
childish
terror
the
extreme
alarm
with
which
his
mother
looked
at
his
father
always
doing
it
he
said
with
a
whimper
many
more
times
will
mother
have
to
tell
you
about
it
before
you
take
any
notice
all
right
old
chap
said
owen
drawing
the
child
nearer
to
him
and
kissing
the
curly
head
and
see
if
you
can
guess
what
i
got
for
you
under
my
coat
in
the
silence
the
purring
of
the
kitten
was
distinctly
audible
kitten
cried
the
boy
taking
it
out
of
its
black
and
i
believe
it
half
a
persian
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
while
frankie
amused
himself
playing
with
the
kitten
which
had
been
provided
with
another
saucer
of
bread
and
milk
owen
went
into
the
bedroom
to
put
on
the
dry
clothes
and
then
those
that
he
had
taken
off
having
been
placed
with
his
boots
near
the
fire
to
dry
he
explained
as
they
were
taking
tea
the
reason
of
his
late
homecoming
afraid
he
wo
find
it
very
easy
to
get
another
job
he
remarked
referring
to
linden
in
the
summer
nobody
will
be
inclined
to
take
him
on
he
too
old
a
dreadful
prospect
for
the
two
children
answered
his
wife
replied
owen
bitterly
the
children
who
will
suffer
most
as
for
linden
and
his
wife
although
of
course
one
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
them
at
the
same
time
there
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
they
deserve
to
suffer
all
their
lives
they
been
working
like
brutes
and
living
in
poverty
although
they
have
done
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
work
they
have
never
enjoyed
anything
like
a
fair
share
of
the
things
they
have
helped
to
produce
and
yet
all
their
lives
they
have
supported
and
defended
the
system
that
robbed
them
and
have
resisted
and
ridiculed
every
proposal
to
alter
it
it
wrong
to
feel
sorry
for
such
people
they
deserve
to
suffer
after
tea
as
he
watched
his
wife
clearing
away
the
tea
things
and
rearranging
the
drying
clothing
by
the
fire
owen
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
she
looked
unusually

well

he
said
crossing
over
to
her
and
putting
his
arm
around
her

replied

her
head
wearily
against
his
shoulder

very
bad

nearly
all
the

answered
and
frankie
went
over
to

and
kissed
her
hand

once
said
owen

other
lamp

mum
remarked
the
boy
dad

carry
me
into
your
room
before
he
puts
me
into
bed
a
little
later
as
owen
was
undressing
frankie
the
latter
remarked
as
he
looked
affectionately
at
the
kitten
which
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
watching
the
child
every
movement
under
the
impression
that
it
was
part
of
some
game
name
do
you
think
we
ought
to
call
it
dad
may
give
him
any
name
you
like
replied
owen
absently
know
a
dog
that
lives
down
the
road
said
the
boy
name
is
major
how
would
that
do
or
we
might
call
him
sergeant
the
kitten
observing
that
he
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
purred
loudly
and
winked
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
did
not
care
what
rank
was
conferred
upon
him
so
long
as
the
commisariat
department
was
properly
attended
to
do
know
though
continued
frankie
thoughtfully
all
right
names
for
dogs
but
i
think
they
too
big
for
a
kitten
you
dad
they
are
said
owen
cats
are
called
tom
or
kitty
but
i
do
want
a
common
name
for
him
ca
you
call
him
after
someone
you
know
know
i
call
him
after
a
little
girl
that
comes
to
our
school
a
fine
name
maud
that
be
a
good
one
wo
it
dad
said
owen
say
dad
said
frankie
suddenly
realizing
the
awful
fact
that
he
was
being
put
to
bed
forgetting
all
about
my
story
and
you
promised
that
you
have
a
game
of
trains
with
me
tonight
had
forgotten
but
i
was
hoping
that
you
had
because
i
very
tired
and
it
very
late
long
past
your
usual
bedtime
you
know
you
can
take
the
kitten
to
bed
with
you
tonight
and
i
tell
you
two
stories
tomorrow
because
it
saturday
right
then
said
the
boy
contentedly
i
get
the
railway
station
built
and
i
have
the
lines
chalked
on
the
floor
and
the
signals
put
up
before
you
come
home
so
that
there
be
no
time
wasted
and
i
put
one
chair
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
another
chair
at
the
other
end
and
tie
some
string
across
for
telegraph
wires
that
be
a
very
good
idea
wo
it
dad
and
owen
agreed
of
course
i
come
to
meet
you
just
the
same
as
other
saturdays
because
i
going
to
buy
a
of
milk
for
the
kitten
out
of
my
penny
after
the
child
was
in
bed
owen
sat
alone
by
the
table
in
the
draughty
thinking
although
there
was
a
bright
fire
the
room
was
very
cold
being
so
close
to
the
roof
the
wind
roared
loudly
round
the
gables
shaking
the
house
in
a
way
that
threatened
every
moment
to
hurl
it
to
the
ground
the
lamp
on
the
table
had
a
green
glass
reservoir
which
was
half
full
of
oil
owen
watched
this
with
unconscious
fascination
every
time
a
gust
of
wind
struck
the
house
the
oil
in
the
lamp
was
agitated
and
rippled
against
the
glass
like
the
waves
of
a
miniature
sea
staring
abstractedly
at
the
lamp
he
thought
of
the
future
a
few
years
ago
the
future
had
seemed
a
region
of
wonderful
and
mysterious
possibilities
of
good
but
tonight
the
thought
brought
no
such
illusions
for
he
knew
that
the
story
of
the
future
was
to
be
much
the
same
as
the
story
of
the
past
the
story
of
the
past
would
continue
to
repeat
itself
for
a
few
years
longer
he
would
continue
to
work
and
they
would
all
three
continue
to
do
without
most
of
the
necessaries
of
life
when
there
was
no
work
they
would
starve
for
himself
he
did
not
care
much
because
he
knew
that
at
the
best
or
worst
it
would
only
be
a
very
few
years
even
if
he
were
to
have
proper
food
and
clothing
and
be
able
to
take
reasonable
care
of
himself
he
could
not
live
much
longer
but
when
that
time
came
what
was
to
become
of
them
there
would
be
some
hope
for
the
boy
if
he
were
more
robust
and
if
his
character
were
less
gentle
and
more
selfish
under
the
present
system
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
succeed
in
life
without
injuring
other
people
and
treating
them
and
making
use
of
them
as
one
would
not
like
to
be
treated
and
made
use
of
oneself
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
world
it
was
necessary
to
be
brutal
selfish
and
unfeeling
to
push
others
aside
and
to
take
advantage
of
their
misfortunes
to
undersell
and
crush
out
one
competitors
by
fair
means
or
foul
to
consider
one
own
interests
first
in
every
case
absolutely
regardless
of
the
wellbeing
of
others
that
was
the
ideal
character
owen
knew
that
frankie
character
did
not
come
up
to
this
lofty
ideal
then
there
was
nora
how
would
she
fare
owen
stood
up
and
began
walking
about
the
room
oppressed
with
a
kind
of
terror
presently
he
returned
to
the
fire
and
began
rearranging
the
clothes
that
were
drying
he
found
that
the
boots
having
been
placed
too
near
the
fire
had
dried
too
quickly
and
consequently
the
sole
of
one
of
them
had
begun
to
split
away
from
the
upper
he
remedied
this
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
then
turned
the
wetter
parts
of
the
clothing
to
the
fire
whilst
doing
this
he
noticed
the
newspaper
which
he
had
forgotten
in
the
coat
pocket
he
drew
it
out
with
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
here
was
something
to
distract
his
thoughts
if
not
instructive
or
comforting
it
would
at
any
rate
be
interesting
and
even
amusing
to
read
the
reports
of
the
futile
talk
of
the
profound
statesmen
who
with
comical
gravity
presided
over
the
working
of
the
great
system
which
their
combined
wisdom
pronounced
to
be
the
best
that
could
possibly
be
devised
but
tonight
owen
was
not
to
read
of
those
things
for
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
paper
his
attention
was
riveted
by
the
staring
headline
of
one
of
the
principal
columns
terrible
domestic
tragedy
wife
and
two
children
killed
suicide
of
the
murderer
it
was
one
of
the
ordinary
poverty
crimes
the
man
had
been
without
employment
for
many
weeks
and
they
had
been
living
by
pawning
or
selling
their
furniture
and
other
possessions
but
even
this
resource
must
have
failed
at
last
and
when
one
day
the
neighbours
noticed
that
the
blinds
remained
down
and
that
there
was
a
strange
silence
about
the
house
no
one
coming
out
or
going
in
suspicions
that
something
was
wrong
were
quickly
aroused
when
the
police
entered
the
house
they
found
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
the
dead
bodies
of
the
woman
and
the
two
children
with
their
throats
severed
laid
out
side
by
side
upon
the
bed
which
was
saturated
with
their
blood
there
was
no
bedstead
and
no
furniture
in
the
room
except
the
straw
mattress
and
the
ragged
clothes
and
blankets
which
formed
the
bed
upon
the
floor
the
man
body
was
found
in
the
kitchen
lying
with
outstretched
arms
face
downwards
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
the
blood
that
had
poured
from
the
wound
in
his
throat
which
had
evidently
been
inflicted
by
the
razor
that
was
grasped
in
his
right
hand
no
particle
of
food
was
found
in
the
house
and
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
in
the
kitchen
was
hung
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
is
not
my
crime
but
society
the
report
went
on
to
explain
that
the
deed
must
have
been
perpetrated
during
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
brought
on
by
the
sufferings
the
man
had
endured
muttered
owen
as
he
read
this
glib
theory
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
have
been
insane
if
he
had
not
killed
them
surely
it
was
wiser
and
better
and
kinder
to
send
them
all
to
sleep
than
to
let
them
continue
to
suffer
at
the
same
time
he
thought
it
very
strange
that
the
man
should
have
chosen
to
do
it
that
way
when
there
were
so
many
other
cleaner
easier
and
more
painless
ways
of
accomplishing
the
same
object
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
most
of
these
killings
were
done
in
more
or
less
the
same
crude
cruel
messy
way
no
he
would
set
about
it
in
a
different
fashion
he
would
get
some
charcoal
then
he
would
paste
strips
of
paper
over
the
joinings
of
the
door
and
windows
of
the
room
and
close
the
register
of
the
grate
then
he
would
kindle
the
charcoal
on
a
tray
or
something
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
then
they
would
all
three
just
lie
down
together
and
sleep
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
everything
there
would
be
no
pain
no
blood
and
no
mess
or
one
could
take
poison
of
course
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
difficulty
in
procuring
it
but
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
find
some
pretext
for
buying
some
laudanum
one
could
buy
several
small
quantities
at
different
shops
until
one
had
sufficient
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
read
somewhere
that
vermillion
one
of
the
colours
he
frequently
had
to
use
in
his
work
was
one
of
the
most
deadly
poisons
and
there
was
some
other
stuff
that
photographers
used
which
was
very
easy
to
procure
of
course
one
would
have
to
be
very
careful
about
poisons
so
as
not
to
select
one
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
pain
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
out
exactly
how
the
stuff
acted
before
using
it
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
to
do
so
then
he
remembered
that
among
his
books
was
one
that
probably
contained
some
information
about
this
subject
he
went
over
to
the
and
presently
found
the
volume
it
was
called
the
cyclopedia
of
practical
medicine
rather
an
old
book
a
little
out
of
date
perhaps
but
still
it
might
contain
the
information
he
wanted
opening
it
he
turned
to
the
table
of
contents
many
different
subjects
were
mentioned
there
and
presently
he
found
the
one
he
sought
poisons
chemically
physiologically
and
pathologically
considered
corrosive
poisons
narcotic
poisons
slow
poisons
consecutive
poisons
accumulative
poisons
he
turned
to
the
chapter
indicated
and
reading
it
he
was
astonished
to
find
what
a
number
of
poisons
there
were
within
easy
reach
of
whoever
wished
to
make
use
of
them
poisons
that
could
be
relied
upon
to
do
their
work
certainly
quickly
and
without
pain
why
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
buy
them
one
could
gather
them
from
the
hedges
by
the
road
side
and
in
the
fields
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
stranger
it
seemed
that
such
a
clumsy
method
as
a
razor
should
be
so
popular
why
almost
any
other
way
would
be
better
and
easier
than
that
strangulation
or
even
hanging
though
the
latter
method
could
scarcely
be
adopted
in
that
house
because
there
were
no
beams
or
rafters
or
anything
from
which
it
would
be
possible
to
suspend
a
cord
still
he
could
drive
some
large
nails
or
hooks
into
one
of
the
walls
for
that
matter
there
were
already
some
on
some
of
the
doors
he
began
to
think
that
this
would
be
an
even
more
excellent
way
than
poison
or
charcoal
he
could
easily
pretend
to
frankie
that
he
was
going
to
show
him
some
new
kind
of
play
he
could
arrange
the
cord
on
the
hook
on
one
of
the
doors
and
then
under
pretence
of
play
it
would
be
done
the
boy
would
offer
no
resistance
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
all
be
over
he
threw
down
the
book
and
pressed
his
hands
over
his
ears
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
boy
hands
and
feet
beating
against
the
panels
of
the
door
as
he
struggled
in
his
death
agony
then
as
his
arms
fell
nervelessly
by
his
side
again
he
thought
that
he
heard
frankie
voice
calling
dad
owen
hastily
opened
the
door
you
calling
frankie
i
been
calling
you
quite
a
long
time
do
you
want
want
you
to
come
here
i
want
to
tell
you
something
what
is
it
dear
i
thought
you
were
asleep
a
long
time
ago
said
owen
as
he
came
into
the
room
just
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
kitten
gone
to
sleep
all
right
but
i
ca
go
i
tried
all
different
ways
counting
and
all
but
it
no
use
so
i
thought
i
ask
you
if
mind
coming
and
staying
with
me
and
letting
me
hold
you
hand
for
a
little
while
and
then
i
could
go
the
boy
twined
his
arms
round
owen
neck
and
hugged
him
very
tightly
dad
i
love
you
so
much
he
said
love
you
so
much
i
could
squeeze
you
to
death
afraid
you
will
if
you
squeeze
me
so
tightly
as
that
the
boy
laughed
softly
as
he
relaxed
his
hold
would
be
a
funny
way
of
showing
you
how
much
i
love
you
would
it
dad
squeezing
you
to
death
i
suppose
it
would
replied
owen
huskily
as
he
tucked
the
bedclothes
round
the
child
shoulders
do
talk
any
more
dear
just
hold
my
hand
and
try
to
sleep
right
said
frankie
lying
there
very
quietly
holding
his
father
hand
and
occasionally
kissing
it
the
child
presently
fell
asleep
then
owen
got
up
very
gently
and
having
taken
the
kitten
out
of
the
bed
again
and
arranged
the
bedclothes
he
softly
kissed
the
boy
forehead
and
returned
to
the
other
room
looking
about
for
a
suitable
place
for
the
kitten
to
sleep
in
he
noticed
frankie
toy
box
and
having
emptied
the
toys
on
to
the
floor
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
made
a
bed
in
the
box
with
some
rags
and
placed
it
on
its
side
on
the
hearthrug
facing
the
fire
and
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
the
kitten
to
lie
in
it
then
having
placed
the
chairs
on
which
his
clothes
were
drying
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
fire
he
went
into
the
bedroom
nora
was
still
awake
you
feeling
any
better
dear
he
said
i
ever
so
much
better
since
i
been
in
bed
but
i
ca
help
worrying
about
your
clothes
i
afraid
they
never
be
dry
enough
for
you
to
put
on
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
could
you
stay
at
home
till
after
breakfast
just
for
once
i
must
do
that
if
i
did
hunter
would
probably
tell
me
to
stay
away
altogether
i
believe
he
would
be
glad
of
an
excuse
to
get
rid
of
another
man
just
now
if
it
raining
like
this
in
the
morning
you
be
wet
through
before
you
get
there
no
good
worrying
about
that
dear
besides
i
can
wear
this
old
coat
that
i
have
on
now
over
the
other
if
you
wrap
your
old
shoes
in
some
paper
and
take
them
with
you
you
can
take
off
your
wet
boots
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
place
all
right
responded
owen
he
added
reassuringly
if
i
do
get
a
little
wet
we
always
have
a
fire
there
you
know
i
hope
the
weather
will
be
a
little
better
than
this
in
the
morning
said
nora
it
a
dreadful
night
i
keep
feeling
afraid
that
the
house
is
going
to
be
blown
down
long
after
nora
was
asleep
owen
lay
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
noise
of
the
rain
as
it
poured
heavily
on
the
roof
chapter
the
exterminating
machines
on
saturday
shouted
philpot
just
after
seven
one
monday
morning
as
they
were
getting
ready
to
commence
work
it
was
still
dark
outside
but
the
scullery
was
dimly
illuminated
by
the
flickering
light
of
two
candles
which
crass
had
lighted
and
stuck
on
the
shelf
over
the
fireplace
in
order
to
enable
him
to
see
to
serve
out
the
different
lots
of
paints
and
brushes
to
the
men
it
do
seem
a
of
a
long
week
do
it
remarked
harlow
as
he
hung
his
overcoat
on
a
nail
and
proceeded
to
put
on
his
apron
and
blouse
bloody
near
enough
of
it
already
to
christ
it
was
growled
the
more
easily
satisfied
easton
extraordinary
as
it
may
appear
none
of
them
took
any
pride
in
their
work
they
did
not
it
they
had
no
conception
of
that
lofty
ideal
of
for
work
sake
which
is
so
popular
with
the
people
who
do
nothing
on
the
contrary
when
the
workers
arrived
in
the
morning
they
wished
it
was
when
they
resumed
work
after
breakfast
they
wished
it
was
after
dinner
they
wished
it
was
one
on
saturday
so
they
went
on
day
after
day
year
after
year
wishing
their
time
was
over
and
without
realizing
it
really
wishing
that
they
were
dead
how
extraordinary
this
must
appear
to
those
idealists
who
believe
in
for
work
sake
but
who
themselves
do
nothing
but
devour
or
use
and
enjoy
or
waste
the
things
that
are
produced
by
the
labour
of
those
others
who
are
not
themselves
permitted
to
enjoy
a
fair
share
of
the
good
things
they
help
to
create
crass
poured
several
lots
of
colour
into
several
pots
he
said
and
sawkins
when
he
comes
can
go
up
and
do
the
top
bedrooms
out
with
this
colour
you
find
a
couple
of
candles
up
there
it
only
goin
to
one
coat
so
see
that
you
make
it
cover
all
right
and
just
look
after
sawkins
a
bit
so
as
make
a
bloody
mess
of
it
you
do
the
doors
and
windows
and
let
do
the
cupboards
and
skirtings
a
bit
of
all
right
i
must
say
harlow
said
addressing
the
company
generally
got
to
teach
a
b
r
like
so
as
can
do
us
out
of
a
job
presently
by
working
under
price
i
ca
it
growled
crass
know
it
is
sends
to
do
paintin
and
i
got
to
put
on
it
there
ai
nothing
else
for
to
do
further
discussion
on
this
subject
was
prevented
by
sawkins
arrival
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
you
come
then
sneered
crass
you
gorn
for
a
sawkins
muttered
something
about
oversleeping
himself
and
having
hastily
put
on
his
apron
he
went
upstairs
with
harlow
let
see
crass
said
addressing
philpot
and
newman
better
go
and
make
a
start
on
the
second
floor
this
is
the
colour
and
a
couple
of
candles
you
better
not
both
go
in
one
room
or
will
growl
about
it
you
take
one
of
the
front
and
let
newman
take
one
of
the
back
rooms
take
a
bit
of
stoppin
with
you
goin
to
two
coats
but
you
better
putty
up
the
as
well
as
you
can
this
time
two
coats
said
philpot
rooms
will
never
look
nothing
with
two
coats
a
light
colour
like
this
only
goin
to
get
two
anyway
returned
crass
testily
said
so
so
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
with
and
get
smeared
over
middlin
sudden
too
crass
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
mention
that
according
to
the
copy
of
the
specification
of
the
work
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
rooms
in
question
were
supposed
to
have
four
coats
crass
now
turned
to
owen
that
he
said
do
know
what
goin
to
be
done
with
that
yet
i
do
think
they
decided
about
it
to
be
done
to
it
will
be
an
extra
because
all
that
said
about
it
in
the
contract
is
to
face
it
up
with
putty
and
give
it
one
coat
of
white
so
you
and
easton
better
get
on
with
it
slyme
was
busy
softening
some
putty
by
rubbing
and
squeezing
it
between
his
hands
suppose
i
better
finish
the
room
i
started
on
on
saturday
he
asked
right
replied
crass
you
got
enough
colour
said
slyme
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
on
the
way
to
his
work
slyme
accosted
bert
the
boy
who
was
engaged
in
lighting
with
some
pieces
of
wood
a
fire
to
boil
the
water
to
make
the
tea
for
breakfast
at
eight
a
bloater
i
want
cooked
he
said
right
replied
bert
it
over
there
on
the
dresser
along
of
philpot
and
mine
slyme
took
the
bloater
from
his
food
basket
but
as
he
was
about
to
put
it
in
the
place
indicated
he
observed
that
his
was
rather
a
larger
one
than
either
of
the
other
two
this
was
an
important
matter
after
they
were
cooked
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
which
was
which
he
might
possibly
be
given
one
of
the
smaller
ones
instead
of
his
own
he
took
out
his
pocket
knife
and
cut
off
the
tail
of
the
large
bloater
it
is
then
he
said
to
bert
cut
the
tail
of
mine
so
as
you
know
which
it
is
it
was
now
about
twenty
minutes
past
seven
and
all
the
other
men
having
been
started
at
work
crass
washed
his
hands
under
the
tap
then
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
having
rigged
up
a
seat
by
taking
two
of
the
drawers
out
of
the
dresser
and
placing
them
on
the
floor
about
six
feet
apart
and
laying
a
plank
across
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
which
was
now
burning
brightly
under
the
pail
and
lighting
his
pipe
began
to
smoke
the
boy
went
into
the
scullery
and
began
washing
up
the
cups
and
jars
for
the
men
to
drink
out
of
bert
was
a
lean
undersized
boy
about
fifteen
years
of
age
and
about
four
feet
nine
inches
in
height
he
had
light
brown
hair
and
hazel
grey
eyes
and
his
clothes
were
of
many
colours
being
thickly
encrusted
with
paint
the
result
of
the
unskillful
manner
in
which
he
did
his
work
for
he
had
only
been
at
the
trade
about
a
year
some
of
the
men
had
nicknamed
him
walking
a
title
which
bert
accepted
this
boy
was
an
orphan
his
father
had
been
a
railway
porter
who
had
worked
very
laboriously
for
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
every
day
for
many
years
with
the
usual
result
namely
that
he
and
his
family
lived
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
poverty
bert
who
was
their
only
child
and
not
very
robust
had
early
shown
a
talent
for
drawing
so
when
his
father
died
a
little
over
a
year
ago
his
mother
readily
assented
when
the
boy
said
that
he
wished
to
become
a
decorator
it
was
a
nice
light
trade
and
she
thought
that
a
really
good
painter
such
as
she
was
sure
he
would
become
was
at
least
always
able
to
earn
a
good
living
resolving
to
give
the
boy
the
best
possible
chance
she
decided
if
possible
to
place
him
at
rushton
that
being
one
of
the
leading
firms
in
the
town
at
first
mr
rushton
demanded
ten
pounds
as
a
premium
the
boy
to
be
bound
for
five
years
no
wages
the
first
year
two
shillings
a
week
the
second
and
a
rise
of
one
shilling
every
year
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
afterwards
as
a
special
favour
a
matter
of
charity
in
fact
as
she
was
a
very
poor
woman
he
agreed
to
accept
five
pounds
this
sum
represented
the
thrifty
savings
of
years
but
the
poor
woman
parted
with
it
willingly
in
order
that
the
boy
should
become
a
skilled
workman
so
bert
was
apprenticed
bound
for
five
years
to
rushton
for
the
first
few
months
his
life
had
been
spent
in
the
at
the
yard
a
place
that
was
something
between
a
cellar
and
a
stable
there
surrounded
by
the
poisonous
pigments
and
materials
of
the
trade
the
youthful
artisan
worked
generally
alone
cleaning
the
dirty
brought
in
by
the
workmen
from
finished
outside
and
occasionally
mixing
paint
according
to
the
instructions
of
mr
hunter
or
one
of
the
sometimes
he
was
sent
out
to
carry
materials
to
the
places
where
the
men
were
working
heavy
loads
of
paint
or
white
lead
sometimes
pails
of
whitewash
that
his
slender
arms
had
been
too
feeble
to
carry
more
than
a
few
yards
at
a
time
often
his
fragile
childish
figure
was
seen
staggering
manfully
along
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
a
pair
of
steps
or
a
heavy
plank
he
could
manage
a
good
many
parcels
at
once
some
in
each
hand
and
some
tied
together
with
string
and
slung
over
his
shoulders
occasionally
however
there
were
more
than
he
could
carry
then
they
were
put
into
a
handcart
which
he
pushed
or
dragged
after
him
to
the
distant
jobs
that
first
winter
the
boy
days
were
chiefly
spent
in
the
damp
without
even
a
fire
to
warm
the
clammy
atmosphere
but
in
all
this
he
had
seen
no
hardship
with
the
unconsciousness
of
boyhood
he
worked
hard
and
cheerfully
as
time
went
on
the
goal
of
his
childish
ambition
was
reached
he
was
sent
out
to
work
with
the
men
and
he
carried
the
same
spirit
with
him
always
doing
his
best
to
oblige
those
with
whom
he
was
working
he
tried
hard
to
learn
and
to
be
a
good
boy
and
he
succeeded
fairly
well
he
soon
became
a
favourite
with
owen
for
whom
he
conceived
a
great
respect
and
affection
for
he
observed
that
whenever
there
was
any
special
work
of
any
kind
to
be
done
it
was
owen
who
did
it
on
such
occasions
bert
in
his
artful
boyish
way
would
scheme
to
be
sent
to
assist
owen
and
the
latter
whenever
possible
used
to
ask
that
the
boy
might
be
allowed
to
work
with
him
bert
regard
for
owen
was
equalled
in
intensity
by
his
dislike
of
crass
who
was
in
the
habit
of
jeering
at
the
boy
aspirations
be
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
think
about
doin
fancy
work
after
you
learnt
to
do
plain
painting
he
would
say
this
morning
when
he
had
finished
washing
up
the
cups
and
mugs
bert
returned
with
them
to
the
kitchen
let
see
said
crass
thoughtfully
put
the
tea
in
the
pail
i
now
you
want
a
job
do
you
replied
the
boy
get
a
bucket
of
water
and
that
old
brush
and
a
swab
and
go
and
wash
off
the
old
whitewash
and
colouring
orf
the
pantry
ceiling
and
walls
right
said
bert
when
he
got
as
far
as
the
door
leading
into
the
scullery
he
looked
round
and
said
got
to
git
them
three
bloaters
cooked
by
breakfast
time
mind
about
that
said
crass
do
them
bert
got
the
pail
and
the
brush
drew
some
water
from
the
tap
got
a
pair
of
steps
and
a
short
plank
one
end
of
which
he
rested
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
the
pantry
and
the
other
on
the
steps
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
crass
instructions
it
was
very
cold
and
damp
and
miserable
in
the
pantry
and
the
candle
only
made
it
seem
more
so
bert
shivered
he
would
like
to
have
put
his
jacket
on
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
at
a
job
like
this
he
lifted
the
bucket
of
water
on
to
one
of
the
shelves
and
climbing
up
on
to
the
plank
took
the
brush
from
the
water
and
soaked
about
a
square
yard
of
the
ceiling
then
he
began
to
scrub
it
with
the
brush
he
was
not
very
skilful
yet
and
as
he
scrubbed
the
water
ran
down
over
the
stock
of
the
brush
over
his
hand
and
down
his
uplifted
arm
wetting
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
when
he
had
scrubbed
it
sufficiently
he
rinsed
it
off
as
well
as
he
could
with
the
brush
and
then
to
finish
with
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pail
of
water
and
taking
out
the
swab
wrung
the
water
out
of
it
and
wiped
the
part
of
the
ceiling
that
he
had
washed
then
he
dropped
it
back
into
the
pail
and
shook
his
numbed
fingers
to
restore
the
circulation
then
he
peeped
into
the
kitchen
where
crass
was
still
seated
by
the
fire
smoking
and
toasting
one
of
the
bloaters
at
the
end
of
a
pointed
stick
bert
wished
he
would
go
upstairs
or
anywhere
so
that
he
himself
might
go
and
have
a
warm
at
the
fire
might
just
as
well
let
me
do
them
bloaters
he
muttered
to
himself
regarding
crass
malignantly
through
the
crack
of
the
door
is
a
fine
job
to
give
to
anybody
a
cold
mornin
like
this
he
shifted
the
pail
of
water
a
little
further
along
the
shelf
and
went
on
with
the
work
a
little
later
crass
still
sitting
by
the
fire
heard
footsteps
approaching
along
the
passage
he
started
up
guiltily
and
thrusting
the
hand
holding
his
pipe
into
his
apron
pocket
retreated
hastily
into
the
scullery
he
thought
it
might
be
hunter
who
was
in
the
habit
of
turning
up
at
all
sorts
of
unlikely
times
but
it
was
only
easton
got
a
bit
of
bacon
i
want
the
young
to
toast
for
me
he
said
as
crass
came
back
can
do
it
yourself
if
you
like
replied
crass
affably
looking
at
his
watch
about
ten
to
eight
easton
had
been
working
for
rushton
for
a
fortnight
and
had
been
wise
enough
to
stand
crass
a
drink
on
several
occasions
he
was
consequently
in
that
gentleman
good
books
for
the
time
being
are
you
getting
on
in
there
crass
asked
alluding
to
the
work
easton
and
owen
were
doing
in
the
ai
fell
out
with
your
mate
yet
i
ai
got
much
to
say
this
morning
cough
pretty
bad
i
can
generally
manage
to
get
on
orl
right
with
anybody
you
know
easton
added
so
can
i
as
a
rule
but
i
get
a
bit
sick
listening
to
that
bloody
fool
accordin
to
everything
wrong
one
day
religion
another
it
politics
and
the
next
it
something
else
it
is
a
bit
thick
too
much
of
it
agreed
easton
i
take
no
notice
of
the
bloody
fool
that
the
best
way
course
we
know
that
things
is
a
bit
bad
just
now
crass
went
on
if
the
likes
of
could
their
own
way
they
make
a
bloody
sight
worse
just
what
i
say
replied
easton
got
a
pill
ready
for
though
next
time
start
yappin
crass
continued
as
he
drew
a
small
piece
of
printed
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
read
that
it
out
of
the
obscurer
easton
took
the
newspaper
cutting
and
read
it
good
he
remarked
as
he
handed
it
back
i
think
that
about
shut
up
did
yer
notice
the
other
day
when
we
was
talking
about
poverty
and
men
bein
out
of
work
dodged
out
of
answerin
wot
i
said
about
machinery
bein
the
cause
of
it
never
answered
me
started
talkin
about
something
else
i
remember
never
answered
it
said
easton
who
had
really
no
recollection
of
the
incident
at
all
mean
to
tackle
about
it
at
i
do
see
why
should
be
allowed
to
get
out
of
it
like
that
there
was
a
bloke
down
at
the
cricketers
the
other
night
talkin
about
the
same
thing
a
chap
as
takes
a
interest
in
politics
and
the
like
and
said
the
very
same
as
me
why
the
number
of
men
what
been
throwed
out
of
work
by
all
this
machinery
is
something
chronic
course
agreed
easton
knows
it
ought
to
give
us
a
look
in
at
the
cricketers
some
night
a
lot
of
decent
chaps
comes
there
i
think
i
will
do
you
usually
use
asked
crass
after
a
pause
easton
laughed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
used
lately
been
too
many
do
make
a
bit
of
difference
do
it
said
crass
be
all
right
till
this
job
done
just
watch
yerself
a
bit
and
do
get
comin
late
in
the
mornin
old
nimrod
dead
nuts
on
that
see
to
that
all
right
replied
easton
do
believe
in
losing
time
when
there
is
work
to
do
it
bad
enough
when
you
get
it
know
crass
went
on
confidentially
me
an
you
an
the
gatepost
as
the
sayin
is
i
do
think
mr
bloody
owen
will
be
much
longer
nimrod
the
sight
of
easton
had
it
in
his
mind
to
say
that
nimrod
seemed
to
hate
the
sight
of
all
of
them
but
he
made
no
remark
and
crass
continued
all
about
the
way
owen
goes
on
about
politics
and
religion
an
one
thing
an
another
an
about
the
firm
scampin
the
work
you
know
that
sort
of
talk
do
do
does
it
course
not
would
got
rid
of
long
ago
but
it
was
as
took
on
in
the
first
place
it
was
rushton
as
give
a
start
it
seems
owen
took
a
lot
of
samples
of
work
an
showed
to
the
bloke
them
the
things
wot
up
in
the
said
crass
contemptuously
no
good
on
plain
work
of
course
does
a
bit
of
grainin
an
writin
after
a
fashion
when
there
any
to
do
and
that
ai
often
but
on
plain
work
why
sawkins
is
as
good
as
for
most
of
it
any
day
i
suppose
is
replied
easton
feeling
rather
ashamed
of
himself
for
the
part
he
was
taking
in
this
conversation
although
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
existence
of
bert
crass
had
instinctively
lowered
his
voice
but
the
boy
who
had
left
off
working
to
warm
his
hands
by
putting
them
into
his
trousers
pockets
managed
by
listening
attentively
to
hear
every
word
know
there
plenty
of
people
would
give
the
firm
no
more
work
if
they
knowed
about
it
crass
continued
fancy
sendin
a
b
r
like
that
to
work
in
a
lady
or
gentleman
a
bloody
atheist
it
is
a
bit
orf
when
you
look
at
it
like
that
know
my
missis
for
one
would
a
feller
like
that
in
our
place
we
a
lodger
once
and
she
found
out
that
was
a
freethinker
or
something
and
she
cleared
out
bloody
quick
i
can
tell
yer
by
the
way
said
easton
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
do
happen
to
know
of
anyone
as
wants
a
room
do
you
we
got
one
more
than
we
want
so
the
wife
thought
that
we
might
as
well
let
it
crass
thought
for
a
moment
say
as
i
do
he
answered
doubtfully
was
talking
last
week
about
leaving
the
place
lodging
at
but
i
do
know
whether
got
another
place
to
go
to
you
might
ask
him
i
do
know
of
anyone
else
speak
to
replied
easton
the
time
it
must
be
nearly
on
it
it
is
just
on
eight
exclaimed
crass
and
drawing
his
whistle
he
blew
a
shrill
blast
upon
it
to
apprise
the
others
of
the
fact
anyone
seen
old
jack
linden
since
got
the
push
inquired
harlow
during
breakfast
seen
saterdy
said
slyme
doin
anything
do
know
i
did
time
to
speak
to
ai
got
nothing
remarked
philpot
seen
saterdy
night
an
told
me
been
walkin
about
ever
since
philpot
did
not
add
that
he
had
linden
a
shilling
which
he
never
expected
to
see
again
wo
be
able
to
get
a
job
again
in
a
remarked
easton
too
old
know
after
all
you
ca
blame
misery
for
sackin
said
crass
after
a
pause
was
too
slow
for
a
funeral
wonder
how
much
you
be
able
to
do
when
you
as
old
as
he
is
said
owen
i
wo
want
to
do
nothing
replied
crass
with
a
feeble
laugh
goin
to
live
on
me
means
should
say
the
best
thing
old
jack
could
do
would
be
to
go
in
the
union
said
harlow
i
reckon
that
what
be
the
end
of
it
said
easton
in
a
tone
a
grand
finish
is
it
observed
owen
working
hard
all
one
life
to
be
treated
like
a
criminal
at
the
end
do
know
what
you
call
bein
treated
like
criminals
exclaimed
crass
reckon
they
a
bloody
fine
time
of
it
an
we
got
to
find
the
money
for
god
sake
do
start
no
more
arguments
cried
harlow
addressing
owen
enough
of
that
last
week
you
ca
expect
a
boss
to
employ
a
man
when
too
old
to
work
course
not
said
crass
philpot
said
nothing
do
see
no
sense
in
always
grumblin
crass
proceeded
things
ca
be
altered
you
ca
expect
there
can
be
plenty
of
work
for
everyone
with
all
this
machinery
what
been
invented
course
said
harlow
people
what
used
to
be
employed
on
the
work
what
now
done
by
machinery
has
to
find
something
else
to
do
some
of
goes
to
our
trade
for
instance
the
result
is
there
too
many
at
it
and
there
ai
enough
work
to
keep
all
goin
cried
crass
eagerly
just
what
i
say
machinery
is
the
real
cause
of
the
poverty
that
what
i
said
the
other
day
is
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
unemployment
replied
owen
it
not
the
cause
of
poverty
that
another
matter
altogether
the
others
laughed
derisively
it
seems
to
me
to
amount
to
the
same
thing
said
harlow
and
nearly
everyone
agreed
does
seem
to
me
to
amount
to
the
same
thing
owen
replied
my
opinion
we
are
all
in
a
state
of
poverty
even
when
we
have
employment
the
condition
we
are
reduced
to
when
we
out
of
work
is
more
properly
described
as
destitution
continued
owen
after
a
short
silence
in
a
shortage
of
the
necessaries
of
life
when
those
things
are
so
scarce
or
so
dear
that
people
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
of
them
to
satisfy
all
their
needs
those
people
are
in
a
condition
of
poverty
if
you
think
that
the
machinery
which
makes
it
possible
to
produce
all
the
necessaries
of
life
in
abundance
is
the
cause
of
the
shortage
it
seems
to
me
that
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
your
minds
of
course
we
all
bloody
fools
except
you
snarled
crass
they
were
servin
out
the
sense
they
give
you
such
a
of
a
lot
there
was
none
left
for
nobody
else
there
was
something
wrong
with
your
minds
continued
owen
would
be
able
to
see
that
we
might
have
plenty
of
work
and
yet
be
in
a
state
of
destitution
the
miserable
wretches
who
toil
sixteen
or
eighteen
hours
a
day
father
mother
and
even
the
little
children
making
or
shirts
or
blouses
have
plenty
of
work
but
i
for
one
do
envy
them
perhaps
you
think
that
if
there
was
no
machinery
and
we
all
had
to
work
thirteen
or
fourteen
hours
a
day
in
order
to
obtain
a
bare
living
we
should
not
be
in
a
condition
of
poverty
talk
about
there
being
something
the
matter
with
your
minds
if
there
were
not
you
would
talk
one
day
about
tariff
reform
as
a
remedy
for
unemployment
and
then
the
next
day
admit
that
machinery
is
the
cause
of
it
tariff
reform
wo
do
away
with
the
machinery
will
it
reform
is
the
remedy
for
bad
trade
returned
crass
that
case
tariff
reform
is
the
remedy
for
a
disease
that
does
not
exist
if
you
would
only
take
the
trouble
to
investigate
for
yourself
you
would
find
out
that
trade
was
never
so
good
as
it
is
at
present
the
output
the
quantity
of
commodities
of
every
kind
produced
in
and
exported
from
this
country
is
greater
than
it
has
ever
been
before
the
fortunes
amassed
in
business
are
larger
than
ever
before
but
at
the
same
time
owing
as
you
have
just
admitted
to
the
continued
introduction
and
extended
use
of
machinery
the
number
of
human
beings
being
employed
is
steadily
decreasing
i
have
here
continued
owen
taking
out
his
figures
which
i
copied
from
the
daily
mail
year
book
for
page
it
is
a
very
noticeable
fact
that
although
the
number
of
factories
and
their
value
have
vastly
increased
in
the
united
kingdom
there
is
an
absolute
decrease
in
the
number
of
men
and
women
employed
in
those
factories
between
and
this
is
doubtless
due
to
the
displacement
of
hand
labour
by
machinery
tariff
reform
deal
with
that
are
the
good
kind
capitalists
going
to
abandon
the
use
of
machinery
if
we
tax
all
goods
does
what
you
call
free
trade
help
us
here
or
do
you
think
that
abolishing
the
house
of
lords
or
disestablishing
the
church
will
enable
the
workers
who
are
displaced
to
obtain
employment
since
it
is
true
as
you
admit
that
machinery
is
the
principal
cause
of
unemployment
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
what
your
remedy
no
one
answered
because
none
of
them
knew
of
any
remedy
and
crass
began
to
feel
sorry
that
he
had
the
subject
at
all
the
near
future
continued
owen
is
probable
that
horses
will
be
almost
entirely
superseded
by
motor
cars
and
electric
trams
as
the
services
of
horses
will
be
no
longer
required
all
but
a
few
of
those
animals
will
be
caused
to
die
out
they
will
no
longer
be
bred
to
the
same
extent
as
formerly
we
ca
blame
the
horses
for
allowing
themselves
to
be
exterminated
they
have
not
sufficient
intelligence
to
understand
what
being
done
therefore
they
will
submit
tamely
to
the
extinction
of
the
greater
number
of
their
kind
we
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
work
which
was
formerly
done
by
human
beings
is
now
being
done
by
machinery
this
machinery
belongs
to
a
few
people
it
is
worked
for
the
benefit
of
those
few
just
the
same
as
were
the
human
beings
it
displaced
these
few
have
no
longer
any
need
of
the
services
of
so
many
human
workers
so
they
propose
to
exterminate
them
the
unnecessary
human
beings
are
to
be
allowed
to
starve
to
death
and
they
are
also
to
be
taught
that
it
is
wrong
to
marry
and
breed
children
because
the
sacred
few
do
not
require
so
many
people
to
work
for
them
as
before
and
you
never
be
able
to
prevent
it
mate
shouted
crass
ca
we
it
ca
be
done
cried
crass
fiercely
impossible
always
sayin
that
everything
all
wrong
complained
harlow
why
the
do
you
tell
us
they
goin
to
be
put
right
does
seem
to
me
as
if
any
of
you
really
wish
to
know
i
believe
that
even
if
it
were
proved
that
it
could
be
done
most
of
you
would
be
sorry
and
would
do
all
you
could
to
prevent
it
do
know
sneered
crass
to
tariff
reform
ai
no
bloody
good
free
trade
ai
no
bloody
good
and
everybody
else
is
wrong
but
when
you
arst
what
ought
to
be
done
flummoxed
crass
did
not
feel
very
satisfied
with
the
result
of
this
machinery
argument
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
would
be
able
to
flatten
out
his
opponent
on
another
subject
the
cutting
from
the
obscurer
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
would
take
a
bit
of
answering
when
you
have
a
thing
in
print
in
black
and
white
why
there
it
is
and
you
ca
get
away
from
it
if
it
was
right
a
paper
like
that
would
never
have
printed
it
however
as
it
was
now
nearly
half
past
eight
he
resolved
to
defer
this
triumph
till
another
occasion
it
was
too
good
a
thing
to
be
disposed
of
in
a
hurry
chapter
the
cap
on
the
stairs
after
breakfast
when
they
were
working
together
in
the
easton
desiring
to
do
owen
a
good
turn
thought
he
would
put
him
on
his
guard
and
repeated
to
him
in
a
whisper
the
substance
of
the
conversation
he
had
held
with
crass
concerning
him
course
you
need
mention
that
i
told
you
frank
he
said
i
thought
i
ought
to
let
you
know
you
can
take
it
from
me
crass
no
friend
of
yours
know
that
for
a
long
time
mate
replied
owen
for
telling
me
all
the
same
bloody
rotter
no
friend
of
mine
either
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
easton
continued
of
course
it
does
do
to
fall
out
with
because
you
never
know
what
he
go
and
say
to
ol
one
has
to
remember
that
course
we
all
know
what
the
matter
with
as
far
as
concerned
easton
went
on
do
like
anyone
on
the
firm
wot
knows
more
about
the
work
than
does
thinks
might
git
worked
out
of
job
owen
laughed
bitterly
need
be
afraid
of
me
on
that
account
i
would
have
his
job
if
it
were
offered
to
me
do
think
so
replied
easton
that
why
got
knife
into
you
believe
that
what
he
said
about
hunter
is
true
enough
said
owen
time
he
comes
here
he
tries
to
goad
me
into
doing
or
saying
something
that
would
give
him
an
excuse
to
tell
me
to
clear
out
i
might
have
done
it
before
now
if
i
had
not
guessed
what
he
was
after
and
been
on
my
guard
meantime
crass
in
the
kitchen
had
resumed
his
seat
by
the
fire
with
the
purpose
of
finishing
his
pipe
of
tobacco
presently
he
took
out
his
and
began
to
write
in
it
with
a
piece
of
pencil
when
the
pipe
was
smoked
out
he
knocked
the
bowl
against
the
grate
to
get
rid
of
the
ash
and
placed
the
pipe
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
then
having
torn
out
the
leaf
on
which
he
had
been
writing
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
pantry
where
bert
was
still
struggling
with
the
old
whitewash
yer
nearly
finished
i
do

the

this

under

bottom
shelf
and
then
i

a
bloody
fine
mess

what
i
can
see
of

growled
crass
at
all
this
water
on
the
floor
bert
looked
guiltily
at
the
floor
and
turned
very
red
clean
it
all
up
he
stammered
soon
as
i
got
this
bit
of
wall
done
i
wipe
all
the
mess
up
with
the
swab
crass
now
took
a
pot
of
paint
and
some
brushes
and
having
put
some
more
fuel
on
the
fire
began
in
a
leisurely
way
to
paint
some
of
the
woodwork
in
the
kitchen
presently
bert
came
in
finished
there
he
said
time
too

a
bit
livelier
than

continued
crass
in
a
jeering
tone
a
little
replied
the
boy
shamefacedly
said
crass
giving
him
the
leaf
he
had
torn
out
of
the
can
go
up
to
the
yard
and
git

venetian

on
it
when
you
take
it
back
tonight
they
got
to
be
painted
at
the
shop
right
when
the
boy
had
departed
crass
took
a
stroll
through
the
house
to
see
how
the
others
were
getting
on
then
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
proceeded
with
his
work
crass
was
about
years
of
age
rather
above
middle
height
and
rather
stout
he
had
a
considerable
quantity
of
curly
black
hair
and
wore
a
short
beard
of
the
same
colour
his
head
was
rather
large
but
low
and
flat
on
top
when
among
his
cronies
he
was
in
the
habit
of
referring
to
his
obesity
as
the
result
of
good
nature
and
a
contented
mind
behind
his
back
other
people
attributed
it
to
beer
some
even
going
to
far
as
to
nickname
him
the
there
was
no
work
of
a
noisy
kind
being
done
this
morning
both
the
carpenters
and
the
bricklayers
having
been
taken
away
temporarily
to
another
at
the
same
time
there
was
not
absolute
silence
occasionally
crass
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
other
workmen
as
they
spoke
to
each
other
sometimes
shouting
from
one
room
to
another
now
and
then
harlow
voice
rang
through
the
house
as
he
sang
snatches
of
songs
or
a
verse
of
a
moody
and
sankey
hymn
and
occasionally
some
of
the
others
joined
in
the
chorus
or
interrupted
the
singer
with
squeals
and
catcalls
once
or
twice
crass
was
on
the
point
of
telling
them
to
make
less
row
there
would
be
a
fine
to
do
if
nimrod
came
and
heard
them
just
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
them
to
stop
the
noise
it
ceased
of
itself
and
he
heard
loud
whispers
out
someone
comin
the
house
became
very
quiet
crass
put
out
his
pipe
and
opened
the
window
and
the
back
door
to
get
rid
of
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
smoke
then
he
shifted
the
pair
of
steps
noisily
and
proceeded
to
work
more
quickly
than
before
most
likely
it
was
old
misery
he
worked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
but
no
one
came
to
the
kitchen
whoever
it
was
must
have
gone
upstairs
crass
listened
attentively
who
could
it
be
he
would
have
liked
to
go
to
see
whom
it
was
but
at
the
same
time
if
it
were
nimrod
crass
wished
to
be
discovered
at
work
he
therefore
waited
a
little
longer
and
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
upstairs
but
was
unable
to
recognize
them
he
was
just
about
to
go
out
into
the
passage
to
listen
when
whoever
it
was
began
coming
downstairs
crass
at
once
resumed
his
work
the
footsteps
came
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
slow
heavy
ponderous
footsteps
but
yet
the
sound
was
not
such
as
would
be
made
by
a
man
heavily
shod
it
was
not
misery
evidently
as
the
footsteps
entered
the
kitchen
crass
looked
round
and
beheld
a
very
tall
obese
figure
with
a
large
fleshy
face
and
a
great
double
chin
the
complexion
being
of
the
colour
and
appearance
of
the
fat
of
uncooked
bacon
a
very
large
fleshy
nose
and
pale
blue
eyes
the
slightly
inflamed
lids
being
almost
destitute
of
he
had
large
fat
feet
cased
in
soft
calfskin
boots
with
spats
his
overcoat
heavily
trimmed
with
sealskin
reached
just
below
the
knees
and
although
the
trousers
were
very
wide
they
were
filled
by
the
fat
legs
within
the
shape
of
the
calves
being
distinctly
perceptible
even
as
the
feet
seemed
about
to
burst
the
uppers
of
the
boots
so
the
legs
appeared
to
threaten
the
trousers
with
disruption
this
man
was
so
large
that
his
figure
completely
filled
up
the
doorway
and
as
he
came
in
he
stooped
slightly
to
avoid
damaging
the
glittering
silk
hat
on
his
head
one
gloved
hand
was
thrust
into
the
pocket
of
the
overcoat
and
in
the
other
he
carried
a
small
gladstone
bag
when
crass
beheld
this
being
he
touched
his
cap
respectfully
morning
sir

told
me
upstairs

mouth

responded
crass
walking
behind
him
obsequiously
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
hoping
that
the
gentleman
might
give
him
a
shilling
crass
followed
him
into
the
front
hall
and
began
explaining
what
progress
had
so
far
been
made
with
the
work
but
as
mr
sweater
answered
only
by
monosyllables
and
grunts
crass
presently
concluded
that
his
conversation
was
not
appreciated
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
meantime
upstairs
philpot
had
gone
into
newman
room
and
was
discussing
with
him
the
possibility
of
extracting
from
mr
sweater
the
price
of
a
little
light
refreshment
think
he
remarked
we

tuneropperty

a

or
ginger
ale
or
and
glycerine
for
all
knows
mr
sweater
now
began
ponderously
the
stairs
and
presently
came
into
the
room
where
philpot
was
the
latter
greeted
him
with
respectful
cordiality
morning
sir

philpot
affably
this
door

asked
sweater
glancing
apprehensively
at
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
sir
answered
philpot
and
added
as
he
looked
meaningly
at
the
great
man
paint

wet
sir
but
the
painters

it
exclaimed
sweater
ignoring
or
not
hearing
the
latter
part
of
philpot

of
the
beastly

philpot
secretly

mo
he
had
a
piece
of
clean
rag
in
his
tool
bag
and
there
was
a
can
of
turps
in
the
room
moistening
the
rag
slightly
with
turps
he
carefully
removed
the
paint
from
sweater
sleeve
all
orf
now
sir
he
remarked
as
he
rubbed
the
place
with
a
dry
part
of
the
rag
smell
of
the
turps
will
go
away
in
about
a
hour
time
said
sweater
philpot
looked
at
him
wistfully
but
sweater
evidently
did
not
understand
and
began
looking
about
the
room
see
they
put
a
new
piece
of
skirting
here
he
observed
sir
said
newman
who
came
into
the
room
just
then
to
get
the
turps
old
piece
was
all
to
bits
with
feel
as
if
i
a
touch
of
the
meself
do
you
said
philpot
to
newman
who
smiled
feebly
and
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
sweater
who
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
significance
of
the
remark
but
walked
out
of
the
room
and
began
climbing
up
to
the
next
floor
where
harlow
and
sawkins
were
working
there
a
bleeder
for
yer
said
philpot
with
indignation
all
the
trouble
i
took
to
clean

not
a
bloody
stiver
well
it
takes
the
cake
do
it
told
you
it
would
be
did
i
replied
newman
i
did
make
it
plain
enough
said
philpot
thoughtfully
must
try
to
get
some
of
our
own
back
somehow
you
know
going
out
on
the
landing
he
called
softly
upstairs
say
harlow
said
that
individual
looking
over
the
banisters
are
yer
getting
on
up
there
all
right
you
know
dry
job
ai
it
philpot
continued
raising
his
voice
a
little
and
winking
at
harlow
it
is
rather
replied
harlow
with
a
grin
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
time
to
take
up
the
collection
do
you
it
would
be
a
bad
idear
i
put
me
cap
on
the
stairs
said
philpot
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
never
knows
yer
luck
things
is
gettin
a
bit
serious
on
this
floor
you
know
my
mate
fainted
away
once
already
philpot
now
went
back
to
his
room
to
await
developments
but
as
sweater
made
no
sign
he
returned
to
the
landing
and
again
hailed
harlow
always
reckon
a
man
can
work
all
the
better
after
a
drink
you
can
seem
to
get
over
more
of
it
like
that
true
enough
responded
harlow
often
noticed
it
meself
sweater
came
out
of
the
front
bedroom
and
passed
into
one
of
the
back
rooms
without
any
notice
of
either
of
the
men
afraid
it
a
frost
mate
harlow
whispered
and
philpot
shaking
his
head
sadly
returned
to
work
but
in
a
little
while
he
came
out
again
and
once
more
accosted
harlow
knowed
a
case
once
he
said
in
a
melancholy
tone
a
chap
died
of
thirst
on
a
job
just
like
this
and
at
the
inquest
the
doctor
said
as
a
pint
would
saved
must
been
a
norrible
death
remarked
harlow
ai
the
work
for
it
mate
replied
philpot
mournfully
was
something
chronic
after
this
final
heartrending
appeal
to
sweater
humanity
they
returned
to
work
satisfied
that
whatever
the
result
of
their
efforts
they
had
done
their
best
they
had
placed
the
matter
fully
and
fairly
before
him
nothing
more
could
be
said
the
issue
now
rested
entirely
with
him
but
it
was
all
in
vain
sweater
either
did
not
or
would
not
understand
and
when
he
came
downstairs
he
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
cap
which
philpot
had
placed
so
conspicuously
in
the
centre
of
the
landing
floor
chapter
who
is
to
pay
sweater
reached
the
hall
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
rushton
entered
by
the
front
door
they
greeted
each
other
in
a
friendly
way
and
after
a
few
remarks
concerning
the
work
that
was
being
done
they
went
into
the
where
owen
and
easton
were
and
rushton
said
about
this
room
have
you
made
up
your
mind
what
you
going
to
have
done
to
it
replied
sweater
i
tell
you
about
that
afterwards
what
i
anxious
about
is
the
drains
have
you
brought
the
plans
it
going
to
cost
wait
a
minute
said
rushton
with
a
slight
gesture
calling
sweater
attention
to
the
presence
of
the
two
workmen
sweater
understood
might
leave
that
for
a
few
minutes
will
you
rushton
continued
addressing
owen
and
easton
and
get
on
with
something
else
for
a
little
while
when
they
were
alone
rushton
closed
the
door
and
remarked
always
as
well
not
to
let
these
fellows
know
more
than
is
necessary
sweater
agreed
this
drain
work
is
really
two
separate
jobs
said
rushton
the
drains
of
the
house
that
is
the
part
of
the
work
actually
on
your
ground
when
that
done
there
will
to
be
a
pipe
carried
right
along
under
this
private
road
to
the
main
road
to
connect
the
drains
of
the
house
with
the
town
main
you
follow
me
what
it
going
to
cost
for
the
lot
the
drains
of
the
house
and
for
the
connecting
pipe
for
the
lot
that
the
lower
you
can
do
it
for
eh
the
lowest
i
figured
it
out
most
carefully
the
time
and
materials
and
that
practically
all
i
charging
you
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
rushton
had
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
estimating
the
cost
of
this
work
he
had
not
the
necessary
knowledge
to
do
so
hunter
had
drawn
the
plans
calculated
the
cost
and
prepared
the
estimate
been
thinking
over
this
business
lately
said
sweater
looking
at
rushton
with
a
cunning
leer
do
see
why
i
should
have
to
pay
for
the
connecting
pipe
the
corporation
ought
to
pay
for
that
what
do
you
say
rushton
laughed
do
see
why
not
he
replied
think
we
could
arrange
it
all
right
do
you
sweater
went
on
the
work
will
have
to
be
done
so
you
better
let
get
on
with
it
covers
both
jobs
you
say
all
right
you
get
on
with
it
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
with
the
corporation
later
on
do
suppose
we
find
very
difficult
to
deal
with
said
rushton
with
a
grin
and
sweater
smiled
agreement
as
they
were
passing
through
the
hall
they
met
hunter
who
had
just
arrived
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
them
as
he
knew
nothing
of
their
appointment
he
wished
them
morning
in
an
awkward
hesitating
undertone
as
if
he
were
doubtful
how
his
greeting
would
be
received
sweater
nodded
slightly
but
rushton
ignored
him
altogether
and
nimrod
passed
on
looking
and
feeling
like
a
disreputable
cur
that
had
just
been
kicked
as
sweater
and
rushton
walked
together
about
the
house
hunter
hovered
about
them
at
a
respectable
distance
hoping
that
presently
some
notice
might
be
taken
of
him
his
dismal
countenance
became
even
longer
than
usual
when
he
observed
that
they
were
about
to
leave
the
house
without
appearing
even
to
know
that
he
was
there
however
just
as
they
were
going
out
rushton
paused
on
the
threshold
and
called
him
hunter
sir
nimrod
ran
to
him
like
a
dog
taken
notice
of
by
his
master
if
he
had
possessed
a
tail
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
wagged
it
rushton
gave
him
the
plans
with
an
intimation
that
the
work
was
to
be
proceeded
with
for
some
time
after
they
were
gone
hunter
crawled
silently
about
the
house
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
up
and
down
the
corridors
and
the
staircases
after
a
while
he
went
into
the
room
where
newman
was
and
stood
quietly
watching
him
for
about
ten
minutes
as
he
worked
the
man
was
painting
the
skirting
and
just
then
he
came
to
a
part
that
was
split
in
several
places
so
he
took
his
knife
and
began
to
fill
the
cracks
with
putty
he
was
so
nervous
under
hunter
scrutiny
that
his
hand
trembled
to
such
an
extent
that
it
took
him
about
twice
as
long
as
it
should
have
done
and
hunter
told
him
so
with
brutal
directness
mind
about
puttying
up
such
little
cracks
as
them
he
shouted
up
with
the
paint
we
ca
afford
to
pay
you
for
messing
about
like
that
newman
made
no
reply
misery
found
no
excuse
for
bullying
anyone
else
because
they
were
all
tearing
into
it
for
all
they
were
worth
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
house
like
an
evil
spirit
he
was
followed
by
the
furtively
unfriendly
glances
of
the
men
who
cursed
him
in
their
hearts
as
he
passed
he
sneaked
into
the
and
after
standing
with
a
malignant
expression
silently
watching
owen
and
easton
he
came
out
again
without
having
uttered
a
word
although
he
frequently
acted
in
this
manner
yet
somehow
today
the
circumstance
worried
owen
considerably
he
wondered
uneasily
what
it
meant
and
began
to
feel
vaguely
apprehensive
hunter
silence
seemed
more
menacing
than
his
speech
chapter
the
long
hill
bert
arrived
at
the
shop
and
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
loaded
up
the
handcart
with
all
the
things
he
had
been
sent
for
and
started
on
the
return
journey
he
got
on
all
right
in
the
town
because
the
roads
were
level
and
smooth
being
paved
with
wood
blocks
if
it
had
only
been
like
that
all
the
way
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
although
he
was
a
small
boy
for
such
a
large
truck
and
such
a
heavy
load
while
the
wood
road
lasted
the
principal
trouble
he
experienced
was
the
difficulty
of
seeing
where
he
was
going
the
handcart
being
so
high
and
himself
so
short
the
pair
of
steps
on
the
cart
of
course
made
it
all
the
worse
in
that
respect
however
by
taking
great
care
he
managed
to
get
through
the
town
all
right
although
he
narrowly
escaped
colliding
with
several
vehicles
including
two
or
three
motor
cars
and
an
electric
tram
besides
nearly
knocking
over
an
old
woman
who
was
carrying
a
large
bundle
of
washing
from
time
to
time
he
saw
other
small
boys
of
his
acquaintance
some
of
them
former
schoolmates
some
of
these
passed
by
carrying
heavy
loads
of
groceries
in
baskets
and
others
with
wooden
trays
full
of
joints
of
meat
unfortunately
the
wood
paving
ceased
at
the
very
place
where
the
ground
began
to
rise
bert
now
found
himself
at
the
beginning
of
a
long
stretch
of
macadamized
road
which
rose
slightly
and
persistently
throughout
its
whole
length
bert
had
pushed
a
cart
up
this
road
many
times
before
and
consequently
knew
the
best
method
of
tackling
it
experience
had
taught
him
that
a
full
frontal
attack
on
this
hill
was
liable
to
failure
so
on
this
occasion
he
followed
his
usual
plan
of
making
diagonal
movements
crossing
the
road
repeatedly
from
right
to
left
and
left
to
right
after
the
fashion
of
a
sailing
ship
tacking
against
the
wind
and
halting
about
every
twenty
yards
to
rest
and
take
breath
the
distance
he
was
to
go
was
regulated
not
so
much
by
his
powers
of
endurance
as
by
the
various
objects
by
the
wayside
the
for
instance
during
each
rest
he
used
to
look
ahead
and
select
a
certain
or
street
corner
as
the
next
and
when
he
start
again
he
used
to
make
the
most
strenuous
and
desperate
efforts
to
reach
it
generally
the
goal
he
selected
was
too
distant
for
he
usually
overestimated
his
strength
and
whenever
he
was
forced
to
give
in
he
ran
the
truck
against
the
kerb
and
stood
there
panting
for
breath
and
feeling
profoundly
disappointed
at
his
failure
on
the
present
occasion
during
one
of
these
rests
it
flashed
upon
him
that
he
was
being
a
very
long
time
he
would
have
to
buck
up
or
he
would
get
into
a
row
he
was
not
even
up
the
road
yet
selecting
a
distant
he
determined
to
reach
it
before
resting
again
the
cart
had
a
single
shaft
with
a
at
the
end
forming
the
handle
he
gripped
this
fiercely
with
both
hands
and
placing
his
chest
against
it
with
a
mighty
effort
he
pushed
the
cart
before
him
it
seemed
to
get
heavier
and
heavier
every
foot
of
the
way
his
whole
body
but
especially
the
thighs
and
calves
of
his
legs
pained
terribly
but
still
he
strained
and
struggled
and
said
to
himself
that
he
would
not
give
in
until
he
reached
the
finding
that
the
handle
hurt
his
chest
he
lowered
it
to
his
waist
but
that
being
even
more
painful
he
raised
it
again
to
his
chest
and
struggled
savagely
on
panting
for
breath
and
with
his
heart
beating
wildly
the
cart
became
heavier
and
heavier
after
a
while
it
seemed
to
the
boy
as
if
there
were
someone
at
the
front
of
it
trying
to
push
him
back
down
the
hill
this
was
such
a
funny
idea
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
inclined
to
laugh
but
the
inclination
went
almost
as
soon
as
it
came
and
was
replaced
by
the
dread
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
hold
out
long
enough
to
reach
the
after
all
clenching
his
teeth
he
made
a
tremendous
effort
and
staggered
forward
two
or
three
more
steps
and
then
the
cart
stopped
he
struggled
with
it
despairingly
for
a
few
seconds
but
all
the
strength
had
suddenly
gone
out
of
him
his
legs
felt
so
weak
that
he
nearly
collapsed
on
to
the
ground
and
the
cart
began
to
move
backwards
down
the
hill
he
was
just
able
to
stick
to
it
and
guide
it
so
that
it
ran
into
and
rested
against
the
kerb
and
then
he
stood
holding
it
in
a
way
very
pale
saturated
with
perspiration
and
trembling
his
legs
in
particular
shook
so
much
that
he
felt
that
unless
he
could
sit
down
for
a
little
he
would
fall
down
he
lowered
the
handle
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
spill
the
whitewash
out
of
the
pail
which
was
hanging
from
a
hook
under
the
cart
then
sitting
down
on
the
kerbstone
he
leaned
wearily
against
the
wheel
a
little
way
down
the
road
was
a
church
with
a
clock
in
the
tower
it
was
five
minutes
to
ten
by
this
clock
bert
said
to
himself
that
when
it
was
ten
he
would
make
another
start
whilst
he
was
resting
he
thought
of
many
things
just
behind
that
church
was
a
field
with
several
ponds
in
it
where
he
used
to
go
with
other
boys
to
catch
effets
if
it
were
not
for
the
cart
he
would
go
across
now
to
see
whether
there
were
any
there
still
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
very
eager
to
leave
school
and
go
to
work
but
they
used
to
be
fine
old
times
after
all
then
he
thought
of
the
day
when
his
mother
took
him
to
mr
office
to
him
he
remembered
that
day
very
vividly
it
was
almost
a
year
ago
how
nervous
he
had
been
his
hand
had
trembled
so
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
hold
the
pen
and
even
when
it
was
all
over
they
had
both
felt
very
miserable
somehow
his
mother
had
been
very
nervous
in
the
office
also
and
when
they
got
home
she
cried
a
lot
and
called
him
her
poor
little
fatherless
boy
and
said
she
hoped
he
would
be
good
and
try
to
learn
and
then
he
cried
as
well
and
promised
her
that
he
would
do
his
best
he
reflected
with
pride
that
he
was
keeping
his
promise
about
being
a
good
boy
and
trying
to
learn
in
fact
he
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
trade
already
he
could
paint
back
doors
as
well
as
anybody
and
railings
as
well
owen
had
taught
him
lots
of
things
and
had
promised
to
do
some
patterns
of
graining
for
him
so
that
he
might
practise
copying
them
at
home
in
the
evenings
owen
was
a
fine
chap
bert
resolved
that
he
would
tell
him
what
crass
had
been
saying
to
easton
just
fancy
the
cheek
of
a
rotter
like
crass
trying
to
get
owen
the
sack
it
would
be
more
like
it
if
crass
was
to
be
sacked
himself
so
that
owen
could
be
the
foreman
one
minute
to
ten
with
a
heavy
heart
bert
watched
the
clock
his
legs
were
still
aching
very
badly
he
could
not
see
the
hands
of
the
clock
moving
but
they
were
creeping
on
all
the
same
now
the
minute
hand
was
over
the
edge
of
the
number
and
he
began
to
deliberate
whether
he
might
not
rest
for
another
five
minutes
but
he
had
been
such
a
long
time
already
on
his
errand
that
he
dismissed
the
thought
the
minute
hand
was
now
upright
and
it
was
time
to
go
on
just
as
he
was
about
to
get
up
a
harsh
voice
behind
him
said
much
longer
are
you
going
to
sit
there
bert
started
up
guiltily
and
found
himself
confronted
by
mr
rushton
who
was
regarding
him
with
an
angry
frown
whilst
close
by
towered
the
colossal
figure
of
the
obese
sweater
the
expression
on
his
greasy
countenance
betokening
the
pain
he
experienced
on
beholding
such
as
appalling
example
of
juvenile
depravity
do
you
mean
by
sich
conduct
demanded
rushton
indignantly
idear
of
sitting
there
like
that
when
most
likely
the
men
are
waiting
for
them
things
crimson
with
shame
and
confusion
the
boy
made
no
reply
been
there
a
long
time
continued
rushton
been
you
all
the
time
i
been
comin
down
the
road
bert
tried
to
speak
to
explain
why
he
had
been
resting
but
his
mouth
and
his
tongue
had
become
quite
parched
from
terror
and
he
was
unable
to
articulate
a
single
word
know
that
not
the
way
to
get
on
in
life
my
boy
observed
sweater
lifting
his
forefinger
and
shaking
his
fat
head
reproachfully
along
with
you
at
once
rushton
said
roughly
surprised
at
yer
the
idear
sitting
down
in
my
time
this
was
quite
true
rushton
was
not
merely
angry
but
astonished
at
the
audacity
of
the
boy
that
anyone
in
his
employment
should
dare
to
have
the
impertinence
to
sit
down
in
his
time
was
incredible
the
boy
lifted
the
handle
of
the
cart
and
once
more
began
to
push
it
up
the
hill
it
seemed
heavier
now
that
ever
but
he
managed
to
get
on
somehow
he
kept
glancing
back
after
rushton
and
sweater
who
presently
turned
a
corner
and
were
lost
to
view
then
he
ran
the
cart
to
the
kerb
again
to
have
a
breathe
he
could
have
kept
up
much
further
without
a
spell
even
if
they
had
still
been
watching
him
but
he
did
rest
for
more
than
about
half
a
minute
this
time
because
he
was
afraid
they
might
be
peeping
round
the
corner
at
him
after
this
he
gave
up
the
system
and
halted
for
a
minute
or
so
at
regular
short
intervals
in
this
way
he
at
length
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
congratulated
himself
that
the
journey
was
practically
over
just
before
he
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
house
he
saw
hunter
sneak
out
and
mount
his
bicycle
and
ride
away
bert
wheeled
his
cart
up
to
the
front
door
and
began
carrying
in
the
things
whilst
thus
engaged
he
noticed
philpot
peeping
cautiously
over
the
banisters
of
the
staircase
and
called
out
to
him
us
a
hand
with
this
bucket
of
whitewash
will
yer
joe
me
son
with
the
greatest
of
hagony
replied
philpot
as
he
hurried
down
the
stairs
as
they
were
carrying
it
in
philpot
winked
at
bert
and
whispered
yer
see
pontius
pilate
anywheres
outside
went
away
on
bike
just
as
i
come
in
at
the
gate
thank
gord
for
that
i
do
wish
no
said
philpot
fervently
i
gets
runned
over
with
a
motor
in
this
wish
bert
entirely
concurred
and
similar
charitable
sentiments
were
expressed
by
all
the
others
as
soon
as
they
heard
that
misery
was
gone
just
before
four
that
afternoon
bert
began
to
load
up
the
truck
with
the
venetian
blinds
which
had
been
taken
down
some
days
previously
wonder
who
have
the
job
of
paintin
remarked
philpot
to
newman
they
take
a
couple
of
us
away
from
ere
should
think
so
we
already
most
likely
they
put
on
a
couple
of
fresh
there
a
of
a
lot
of
work
in
all
them
blinds
you
know
i
reckon
they
to
three
or
four
coats
the
state
they
in
no
doubt
that
what
will
be
done
replied
newman
and
added
with
a
mirthless
laugh
do
suppose
they
have
much
difficulty
in
getting
a
couple
of
chaps
you
right
mate
there
plenty
of
walkin
about
as
a
week
work
would
be
a
gordsend
to
to
think
of
it
continued
newman
after
a
pause
believe
the
firm
used
to
give
all
their
blind
work
to
old
latham
the
venetian
blind
maker
prap
they
give
this
lot
to
do
likely
replied
philpot
should
think
can
do
cheaper
even
than
us
chaps
and
that
all
the
firm
cares
about
how
far
their
conjectures
were
fulfilled
will
appear
later
shortly
after
bert
was
gone
it
became
so
dark
that
it
was
necessary
to
light
the
candles
and
philpot
remarked
that
although
he
hated
working
under
such
conditions
yet
he
was
always
glad
when
lighting
up
time
came
because
then
knocking
off
time
was
not
very
far
behind
about
five
minutes
to
five
just
as
they
were
all
putting
their
things
away
for
the
night
nimrod
suddenly
appeared
in
the
house
he
had
come
hoping
to
find
some
of
them
ready
dressed
to
go
home
before
the
proper
time
having
failed
in
this
laudable
enterprise
he
stood
silently
by
himself
for
some
seconds
in
the
this
was
a
spacious
and
lofty
apartment
with
a
large
semicircular
bay
window
round
the
ceiling
was
a
deep
cornice
in
the
the
room
appeared
to
be
of
even
greater
proportions
than
it
really
was
after
standing
thinking
in
this
room
for
a
little
while
hunter
turned
and
strode
out
to
the
kitchen
where
the
men
were
preparing
to
go
home
owen
was
taking
off
his
blouse
and
apron
as
the
other
entered
hunter
addressed
him
with
a
malevolent
snarl
can
call
at
the
office
tonight
as
you
go
home
owen
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
all
the
petty
annoyances
he
had
endured
from
hunter
rushed
into
his
memory
together
with
what
easton
had
told
him
that
morning
he
stood
still
and
speechless
holding
his
apron
in
his
hand
and
staring
at
the
manager
for
he
ejaculated
at
length
the
matter
find
out
what
you
wanted
for
when
you
get
there
returned
hunter
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
away
from
the
house
when
he
was
gone
a
dead
silence
prevailed
the
hands
ceased
their
preparations
for
departure
and
looked
at
each
other
and
at
owen
in
astonishment
to
stand
a
man
off
like
that
when
the
job
was
not
half
finished
and
for
no
apparent
reason
and
of
a
monday
too
it
was
unheard
of
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
indignation
harlow
and
philpot
especially
were
very
wroth
it
comes
to
that
harlow
shouted
got
no
bloody
right
to
do
it
we
entitled
to
an
hour
notice
course
we
are
cried
philpot
his
goggle
eyes
rolling
wildly
with
wrath
i
should
it
too
if
it
was
me
you
take
my
tip
frank
charge
up
to
six
on
yer
time
sheet
and
get
some
of
your
own
back
everyone
joined
in
the
outburst
of
indignant
protest
everyone
that
is
except
crass
and
slyme
but
then
they
were
not
exactly
in
the
kitchen
they
were
out
in
the
scullery
putting
their
things
away
and
so
it
happened
that
they
said
nothing
although
they
exchanged
significant
looks
owen
had
by
this
time
recovered
his
he
collected
all
his
tools
and
put
them
with
his
apron
and
blouse
into
his
with
the
purpose
of
taking
them
with
him
that
night
but
on
reflection
he
resolved
not
to
do
so
after
all
it
was
not
absolutely
certain
that
he
was
going
to
be
off
possibly
they
were
going
to
send
him
on
some
other
job
they
kept
all
together
some
walking
on
the
pavement
and
some
in
the
road
until
they
got
down
town
and
then
separated
crass
sawkins
bundy
and
philpot
adjourned
to
the
for
a
drink
newman
went
on
by
himself
slyme
accompanied
easton
who
had
arranged
with
him
to
come
that
night
to
see
the
bedroom
and
owen
went
in
the
direction
of
the
office
chapter
hands
and
brains
rushton
premises
were
situated
in
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
mugsborough
and
consisted
of
a
shop
with
plate
glass
windows
the
shop
extended
right
through
to
the
narrow
back
street
which
ran
behind
it
the
front
part
of
the
shop
was
stocked
with
mouldings
stands
showing
patterns
of
embossed
wall
and
ceiling
decorations
cases
of
brushes
tins
of
varnish
and
enamel
and
similar
things
the
office
was
at
the
rear
and
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
shop
by
a
partition
glazed
with
muranese
obscured
glass
this
office
had
two
doors
one
in
the
partition
giving
access
to
the
front
shop
and
the
other
by
the
side
of
the
window
and
opening
on
to
the
back
street
the
glass
of
the
lower
sash
of
the
back
window
consisted
of
one
large
pane
on
which
was
painted
in
black
letters
on
a
white
ground
owen
stood
outside
this
window
for
two
or
three
seconds
before
knocking
there
was
a
bright
light
in
the
office
then
he
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
at
once
opened
from
the
inside
by
hunter
and
owen
went
in
rushton
was
seated
in
an
armchair
at
his
desk
smoking
a
cigar
and
reading
one
of
several
letters
that
were
lying
before
him
at
the
back
was
a
large
unframed
photograph
of
the
size
known
as
of
the
interior
of
some
building
at
another
desk
or
rather
table
at
the
other
side
of
the
office
a
young
woman
was
sitting
writing
in
a
large
ledger
there
was
a
typewriting
machine
on
the
table
at
her
side
rushton
glanced
up
carelessly
as
owen
came
in
but
took
no
further
notice
of
him
wait
a
minute
hunter
said
to
owen
and
then
after
conversing
in
a
low
tone
with
rushton
for
a
few
minutes
the
foreman
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
of
the
office
through
the
partition
door
which
led
into
the
front
shop
owen
stood
waiting
for
rushton
to
speak
he
wondered
why
hunter
had
sneaked
off
and
felt
inclined
to
open
the
door
and
call
him
back
one
thing
he
was
determined
about
he
meant
to
have
some
explanation
he
would
not
submit
tamely
to
be
dismissed
without
any
just
reason
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
letter
rushton
looked
up
and
leaning
comfortably
back
in
his
chair
he
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
and
said
in
an
affable
indulgent
tone
such
as
one
might
use
to
a
child
a
bit
of
a
hartist
ai
yer
owen
was
so
surprised
at
this
reception
that
he
was
for
the
moment
unable
to
reply
know
what
i
mean
continued
rushton
work
something
like
them
samples
of
yours
what
hanging
up
there
he
noticed
the
embarrassment
of
owen
manner
and
was
gratified
he
thought
the
man
was
confused
at
being
spoken
to
by
such
a
superior
person
as
himself
mr
rushton
was
about
years
of
age
with
light
grey
eyes
fair
hair
and
moustache
and
his
complexion
was
a
whitey
drab
he
was
tall
about
five
feet
ten
inches
and
rather
clumsily
built
not
corpulent
but
fat
in
good
condition
he
appeared
to
be
very
well
fed
and
well
cared
for
generally
his
clothes
were
well
made
of
good
quality
and
fitted
him
perfectly
he
was
dressed
in
a
grey
norfolk
suit
dark
brown
boots
and
knitted
woollen
stockings
reaching
to
the
knee
he
was
a
man
who
took
himself
very
seriously
there
was
an
air
of
pomposity
and
arrogant
importance
about
him
which
considering
who
and
what
he
was
would
have
been
entertaining
to
any
observer
gifted
with
a
sense
of
humour
replied
owen
at
last
can
do
a
little
of
that
sort
of
work
although
of
course
i
do
profess
to
be
able
to
do
it
as
well
or
as
quickly
as
a
man
who
does
nothing
else
no
of
course
not
but
i
think
you
could
manage
this
all
right
it
that
at
the
mr
sweater
been
speaking
to
me
about
it
it
seems
that
when
he
was
over
in
paris
some
time
since
he
saw
a
room
that
took
his
fancy
the
walls
and
ceiling
was
not
papered
but
painted
you
know
what
i
mean
sort
of
panelled
out
and
decorated
with
stencils
and
hand
painting
this
a
photer
of
it
it
done
in
a
sort
of
japanese
fashion
he
handed
the
photograph
to
owen
as
he
spoke
it
represented
a
room
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
which
were
decorated
in
a
moorish
style
first
mr
sweater
thought
of
getting
a
firm
from
london
to
do
it
but
gave
up
the
idear
on
account
of
the
expense
but
if
you
can
do
it
so
that
it
does
cost
too
much
i
think
i
can
persuade
to
go
in
for
it
but
if
it
goin
to
cost
a
lot
it
wo
come
off
at
all
just
a
frieze
put
up
and
the
room
papered
in
the
ordinary
way
this
was
not
true
rushton
said
it
in
case
owen
might
want
to
be
paid
extra
wages
while
doing
the
work
the
truth
was
that
sweater
was
going
to
have
the
room
decorated
in
any
case
and
intended
to
get
a
london
firm
to
do
it
he
had
consented
rather
unwillingly
to
let
rushton
submit
him
an
estimate
because
he
thought
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
the
work
satisfactorily
owen
examined
the
photograph
closely
you
do
anything
like
that
in
that
room
i
think
so
replied
owen
you
know
i
do
want
you
to
start
on
the
job
and
not
be
able
to
finish
it
can
you
do
it
or
not
rushton
felt
sure
that
owen
could
do
it
and
was
very
desirous
that
he
should
undertake
it
but
he
did
not
want
him
to
know
that
he
wished
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
was
almost
indifferent
whether
owen
did
the
work
or
not
in
fact
he
wished
to
seem
to
be
conferring
a
favour
upon
him
by
procuring
him
such
a
nice
job
as
this
tell
you
what
i
can
do
owen
replied
can
make
you
a
watercolour
sketch
a
design
and
if
you
think
it
good
enough
of
course
i
can
reproduce
it
on
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
and
i
can
let
you
know
within
a
little
how
long
it
will
take
rushton
appeared
to
reflect
owen
stood
examining
the
photograph
and
began
to
feel
an
intense
desire
to
do
the
work
rushton
shook
his
head
dubiously
i
let
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
over
the
sketches
and
then
mr
sweater
does
not
approve
of
your
design
where
do
i
come
in
suppose
we
put
it
like
this
i
draw
the
design
at
home
in
the
evenings
in
my
own
time
if
it
accepted
i
charge
you
for
the
time
i
spent
upon
it
if
it
not
suitable
i
wo
charge
the
time
at
all
rushton
brightened
up
considerably
right
you
can
do
so
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
good
nature
you
must
pile
it
on
too
thick
in
any
case
you
know
because
as
i
said
before
want
to
spend
too
much
money
on
it
in
fact
if
it
going
to
cost
a
great
deal
simply
wo
it
done
at
all
rushton
knew
owen
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
no
consideration
of
time
or
pains
would
prevent
him
from
putting
the
very
best
that
was
in
him
into
this
work
he
knew
that
if
the
man
did
the
room
at
all
there
was
no
likelihood
of
his
scamping
it
for
the
sake
of
getting
it
done
quickly
and
for
that
matter
rushton
did
not
wish
him
to
hurry
over
it
all
that
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
impress
upon
owen
from
the
very
first
that
he
must
not
charge
too
much
time
any
profit
that
it
was
possible
to
make
out
of
the
work
rushton
meant
to
secure
for
himself
he
was
a
smart
man
this
rushton
he
possessed
the
ideal
character
the
kind
of
character
that
is
necessary
for
any
man
who
wishes
to
succeed
in
business
to
get
on
in
life
in
other
words
his
disposition
was
very
similar
to
that
of
a
pig
he
was
intensely
selfish
no
one
had
any
right
to
condemn
him
for
this
because
all
who
live
under
the
present
system
practise
selfishness
more
or
less
we
must
be
selfish
the
system
demands
it
we
must
be
selfish
or
we
shall
be
hungry
and
ragged
and
finally
die
in
the
gutter
the
more
selfish
we
are
the
better
off
we
shall
be
in
the
of
life
only
the
selfish
and
cunning
are
able
to
survive
all
others
are
beaten
down
and
trampled
under
foot
no
one
can
justly
be
blamed
for
acting
selfishly
it
is
a
matter
of
we
must
either
injure
or
be
injured
it
is
the
system
that
deserves
to
be
blamed
what
those
who
wish
to
perpetuate
the
system
deserve
is
another
question
do
you
think
you
have
the
drawings
ready
inquired
rushton
you
get
them
done
tonight
afraid
not
replied
owen
feeling
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
absurdity
of
the
question
will
need
a
little
thinking
about
can
you
have
them
ready
then
this
is
monday
wednesday
morning
owen
hesitated
do
want
to
keep
waiting
too
long
you
know
or
may
give
up
the
idear
altogether
say
friday
morning
then
said
owen
resolving
that
he
would
stay
up
all
night
if
necessary
to
get
it
done
rushton
shook
his
head
you
get
it
done
before
that
i
afraid
that
if
we
keeps
waiting
all
that
time
we
may
lose
the
job
altogether
ca
get
them
done
any
quicker
in
my
spare
time
returned
owen
flushing
you
like
to
let
me
stay
home
tomorrow
and
charge
the
time
the
same
as
if
i
had
gone
to
work
at
the
house
i
could
go
to
my
ordinary
work
on
wednesday
and
let
you
have
the
drawings
on
thursday
morning
all
right
said
rushton
as
he
returned
to
the
perusal
of
his
letters
that
night
long
after
his
wife
and
frankie
were
asleep
owen
worked
in
the
searching
through
old
numbers
of
the
journal
and
through
the
illustrations
in
other
books
of
designs
for
examples
of
moorish
work
and
making
rough
sketches
in
pencil
he
did
not
attempt
to
finish
anything
yet
it
was
necessary
to
think
first
but
he
roughed
out
the
general
plan
and
when
at
last
he
did
go
to
bed
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
he
almost
fancied
he
was
in
the
at
the
first
of
all
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
down
the
ugly
plaster
centre
flower
with
its
crevices
all
filled
up
with
old
whitewash
the
cornice
was
all
right
it
was
fortunately
a
very
simple
one
with
a
deep
cove
and
without
many
enrichments
then
when
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
had
been
properly
prepared
the
ornamentation
would
be
proceeded
with
the
walls
divided
into
panels
and
arches
containing
painted
designs
and
the
panels
of
the
door
decorated
in
a
similar
manner
the
mouldings
of
the
door
and
window
frames
picked
out
with
colours
and
gold
so
as
to
be
in
character
with
the
other
work
the
cove
of
the
cornice
a
dull
yellow
with
a
bold
ornament
in
colour
gold
was
not
advisable
in
the
hollow
because
of
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
light
but
some
of
the
smaller
mouldings
of
the
cornice
should
be
gold
on
the
ceiling
there
would
be
one
large
panel
covered
with
an
appropriate
design
in
gold
and
colours
and
surrounded
by
a
wide
margin
or
border
to
separate
this
margin
from
the
centre
panel
there
would
be
a
narrow
border
and
another
border
but
wider
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
margin
where
the
ceiling
met
the
cornice
both
these
borders
and
the
margin
would
be
covered
with
ornamentation
in
colour
and
gold
great
care
would
be
necessary
when
deciding
what
parts
were
to
be
gilded
because
whilst
large
masses
of
gilding
are
apt
to
look
garish
and
in
bad
taste
a
lot
of
fine
gold
lines
are
ineffective
especially
on
a
flat
surface
where
they
do
not
always
catch
the
light
process
by
process
he
traced
the
work
and
saw
it
advancing
stage
by
stage
until
finally
the
large
apartment
was
transformed
and
glorified
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
he
experienced
in
the
planning
of
the
work
there
came
the
fear
that
perhaps
they
would
not
have
it
done
at
all
the
question
what
personal
advantage
would
he
gain
never
once
occurred
to
owen
he
simply
wanted
to
do
the
work
and
he
was
so
fully
occupied
with
thinking
and
planning
how
it
was
to
be
done
that
the
question
of
profit
was
crowded
out
but
although
this
question
of
what
profit
could
be
made
out
of
the
work
never
occurred
to
owen
it
would
in
due
course
by
fully
considered
by
mr
rushton
in
fact
it
was
the
only
thing
about
the
work
that
mr
rushton
would
think
of
at
all
how
much
money
could
be
made
out
of
it
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
saying
men
work
with
their
hands
the
master
works
with
his
brains
chapter
the
letting
of
the
room
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
the
men
separated
owen
going
to
the
office
to
see
rushton
and
the
others
on
their
several
ways
easton
and
slyme
went
together
during
the
day
easton
had
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
about
the
bedroom
slyme
was
about
to
leave
the
place
where
he
was
at
present
lodging
and
he
told
easton
that
although
he
had
almost
decided
on
another
place
he
would
take
a
look
at
the
room
at
suggestion
they
arranged
that
slyme
was
to
accompany
him
home
that
night
as
the
former
remarked
slyme
could
come
to
see
the
place
and
if
he
did
like
it
as
well
as
the
other
he
was
thinking
of
taking
there
was
no
harm
done
ruth
had
contrived
to
furnish
the
room
some
of
the
things
she
had
obtained
on
credit
from
a
furniture
dealer
exactly
how
she
had
managed
easton
did
not
know
but
it
was
done
is
the
house
said
easton
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
creaked
loudly
on
its
hinges
and
then
closed
of
itself
rather
noisily
ruth
had
just
been
putting
the
child
to
sleep
and
she
stood
up
as
they
came
in
hastily
fastening
the
bodice
of
her
dress
as
she
did
so
brought
a
gentleman
to
see
you
said
easton
although
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
out
for
someone
for
the
room
ruth
had
not
expected
him
to
bring
anyone
home
in
this
sudden
manner
and
she
could
not
help
wishing
that
he
had
told
her
beforehand
of
his
intention
it
being
monday
she
had
been
very
busy
all
day
and
she
was
conscious
that
she
was
rather
untidy
in
her
appearance
her
long
brown
hair
was
twisted
loosely
into
a
coil
behind
her
head
she
blushed
in
an
embarrassed
way
as
the
young
man
stared
at
her
easton
introduced
slyme
by
name
and
they
shook
hands
and
then
at
ruth
suggestion
easton
took
a
light
to
show
him
the
room
and
while
they
were
gone
ruth
hurriedly
tidied
her
hair
and
dress
when
they
came
down
again
slyme
said
he
thought
the
room
would
suit
him
very
well
what
were
the
terms
did
he
wish
to
take
the
room
only
just
to
lodge
inquired
ruth
or
would
he
prefer
to
board
as
well
slyme
intimated
that
he
desired
the
latter
arrangement
in
that
case
she
thought
twelve
shillings
a
week
would
be
fair
she
believed
that
was
about
the
usual
amount
of
course
that
would
include
washing
and
if
his
clothes
needed
a
little
mending
she
would
do
it
for
him
slyme
expressed
himself
satisfied
with
these
terms
which
were
as
ruth
had
said
about
the
usual
ones
he
would
take
the
room
but
he
was
not
leaving
his
present
lodgings
until
saturday
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
he
was
to
bring
his
box
on
saturday
evening
when
he
had
gone
easton
and
ruth
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
ever
since
this
plan
of
letting
the
room
first
occurred
to
them
they
had
been
very
anxious
to
accomplish
it
and
yet
now
that
it
was
done
they
felt
dissatisfied
and
unhappy
as
if
they
had
suddenly
experienced
some
irreparable
misfortune
in
that
moment
they
remembered
nothing
of
the
darker
side
of
their
life
together
the
hard
times
and
the
privations
were
far
off
and
seemed
insignificant
beside
the
fact
that
this
stranger
was
for
the
future
to
share
their
home
to
ruth
especially
it
seemed
that
the
happiness
of
the
past
twelve
months
had
suddenly
come
to
an
end
she
shrank
with
involuntary
aversion
and
apprehension
from
the
picture
that
rose
before
her
of
the
future
in
which
this
intruder
appeared
the
most
prominent
figure
dominating
everything
and
interfering
with
every
detail
of
their
home
life
of
course
they
had
known
all
this
before
but
somehow
it
had
never
seemed
so
objectionable
as
it
did
now
and
as
easton
thought
of
it
he
was
filled
an
unreasonable
resentment
against
slyme
as
if
the
latter
had
forced
himself
upon
them
against
their
will
him
he
thought
wish
i
never
brought
him
here
at
all
ruth
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
very
happy
about
it
either
he
said
at
last
do
you
think
of
him
he
be
all
right
i
suppose
my
part
i
wish
he
was
coming
easton
continued
just
what
i
was
thinking
replied
ruth
dejectedly
like
him
at
all
i
seemed
to
turn
against
him
directly
he
came
in
the
door
a
good
mind
to
back
out
of
it
somehow
tomorrow
exclaimed
easton
after
another
silence
could
tell
him
we
unexpectedly
got
some
friends
coming
to
stay
with
us
said
ruth
eagerly
would
be
easy
enough
to
make
some
excuse
or
other
as
this
way
of
escape
presented
itself
she
felt
as
if
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
but
almost
in
the
same
instant
she
remembered
the
reasons
which
had
at
first
led
them
to
think
of
letting
the
room
and
she
added
disconsolately
foolish
for
us
to
go
on
like
this
dear
we
must
let
the
room
and
it
might
just
as
well
be
him
as
anyone
else
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
that
all
easton
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
staring
gloomily
at
her
i
suppose
that
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
he
replied
at
length
we
ca
stand
it
we
give
up
the
house
and
take
a
couple
of
rooms
or
a
small
flat
if
we
can
get
one
ruth
agreed
although
neither
alternative
was
very
inviting
the
unwelcome
alteration
in
their
circumstances
was
after
all
not
altogether
without
its
compensations
because
from
the
moment
of
arriving
at
this
decision
their
love
for
each
other
seemed
to
be
renewed
and
intensified
they
remembered
with
acute
regret
that
hitherto
they
had
not
always
fully
appreciated
the
happiness
of
that
exclusive
companionship
of
which
there
now
remained
to
them
but
one
week
more
for
once
the
present
was
esteemed
at
its
proper
value
being
invested
with
some
of
the
glamour
which
almost
always
envelops
the
past
chapter
penal
servitude
and
death
on
tuesday
the
day
after
his
interview
with
rushton
owen
remained
at
home
working
at
the
drawings
he
did
not
get
them
finished
but
they
were
so
far
advanced
that
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
complete
them
after
tea
on
wednesday
evening
he
did
not
go
to
work
until
after
breakfast
on
wednesday
and
his
continued
absence
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
of
the
other
workmen
that
he
had
been
discharged
this
belief
was
further
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
a
new
hand
had
been
sent
to
the
house
by
hunter
who
came
himself
also
at
about
a
quarter
past
seven
and
very
nearly
caught
philpot
in
the
act
of
smoking
during
breakfast
philpot
addressing
crass
and
referring
to
hunter
inquired
anxiously
temper
this
mornin
bob
mild
as
milk
replied
crass
think
butter
would
melt
in
mouth
quite
pleased
with
did
said
harlow
remarked
newman
said
good
morning
to
me
did
to
me
said
easton
come
inter
the
an
ses
oh
you
in
are
yer
easton
ses
just
like
that
quite
affable
like
so
i
ses
yes
sir
well
ses
get
it
slobbered
over
as
quick
as
you
can
ses
we
ai
got
much
for
this
job
do
spend
a
lot
of
time
puttying
up
just
smear
it
over
an
let
it
go
certinly
seemed
very
pleased
about
something
said
harlow
thought
prap
there
was
a
undertaking
job
in
one
o
them
generally
puts
in
a
good
humour
believe
that
nothing
would
please
so
much
as
to
see
a
epidemic
break
out
remarked
philpot
hinfluenza
cholery
morbus
or
anything
like
that
do
you
remember
was
last
summer
when
there
was
such
a
lot
of
scarlet
fever
about
observed
harlow
said
crass
with
a
chuckle
recollect
we
six
funerals
to
do
in
one
week
ole
misery
was
as
pleased
as
punch
because
of
course
as
a
rule
there
ai
many
jobs
in
the
summer
it
in
winter
as
hundertakers
reaps
their
ai
very
many
this
winter
though
so
far
said
harlow
so
many
as
usual
admitted
crass
still
we
ca
grumble
we
one
nearly
every
week
since
the
beginning
of
october
not
so
bad
you
know
crass
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
undertaking
department
of
rushton
business
he
always
had
the
job
of
polishing
or
varnishing
the
coffin
and
assisting
to
take
it
home
and
to
in
the
corpse
besides
acting
as
one
of
the
bearers
at
the
funeral
this
work
was
more
highly
paid
for
than
painting
i
do
think
there
no
funeral
job
in
added
crass
after
a
pause
think
it
because
glad
to
see
the
end
of
owen
if
yeh
ask
me
that
got
something
to
do
with
it
said
harlow
all
the
same
i
do
call
that
a
proper
way
to
treat
anyone
givin
a
man
the
push
in
that
way
just
because
to
a
spite
against
wot
i
call
a
bl
dy
shame
cried
philpot
a
chap
wots
always
ready
to
do
a
good
turn
to
anybody
and
knows
work
although
is
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
sometimes
i
must
admit
when
gets
on
about
socialism
suppose
misery
did
say
nothin
about
this
mornin
inquired
easton
replied
crass
and
added
only
owen
do
think
as
i
never
said
anything
against
looked
at
me
very
funny
that
night
after
nimrod
went
away
owen
need
think
nothing
like
that
about
me
because
i
a
chap
like
this
if
i
could
do
nobody
no
good
i
would
never
do
no
at
this
some
of
the
others
furtively
exchanged
significant
glances
and
harlow
began
to
smile
but
no
one
said
anything
philpot
noticing
that
the
newcomer
had
not
helped
himself
to
any
tea
called
bert
attention
to
the
fact
and
the
boy
filled
owen
cup
and
passed
it
over
to
the
new
hand
their
conjectures
regarding
the
cause
of
hunter
good
humour
were
all
wrong
as
the
reader
knows
owen
had
not
been
discharged
at
all
and
there
was
nobody
dead
the
real
reason
was
that
having
decided
to
take
on
another
man
hunter
had
experienced
no
difficulty
in
getting
one
at
the
same
reduced
rate
as
that
which
newman
was
working
for
there
being
such
numbers
of
men
out
of
employment
hitherto
the
usual
rate
of
pay
in
mugsborough
had
been
sevenpence
an
hour
for
skilled
painters
the
reader
will
remember
that
newman
consented
to
accept
a
job
at
sixpence
halfpenny
so
far
none
of
the
other
workmen
knew
that
newman
was
working
under
price
he
had
told
no
one
not
feeling
sure
whether
he
was
the
only
one
or
not
the
man
whom
hunter
had
taken
on
that
morning
also
decided
in
his
mind
that
he
would
keep
his
own
counsel
concerning
what
pay
he
was
to
receive
until
he
found
out
what
the
others
were
getting
just
before
half
past
eight
owen
arrived
and
was
immediately
assailed
with
questions
as
to
what
had
transpired
at
the
office
crass
listened
with
chagrin
to
owen
account
but
most
of
the
others
were
genuinely
pleased
what
a
way
to
speak
to
anybody
observed
harlow
referring
to
hunter
manner
on
the
previous
monday
night
know
i
reckon
if
ole
misery
four
legs
make
a
very
good
pig
said
philpot
solemnly
you
ca
expect
nothin
from
a
pig
but
a
grunt
during
the
morning
as
easton
and
owen
were
working
together
in
the
the
former
remarked
i
tell
you
i
had
a
room
i
wanted
to
let
frank
i
think
you
did
i
let
it
to
slyme
i
think
he
seems
a
very
decent
sort
of
chap
do
you
i
suppose
he
is
replied
owen
hesitatingly
know
nothing
against
him
course
we
rather
the
to
ourselves
if
we
could
afford
it
but
work
is
so
scarce
lately
i
been
figuring
out
exactly
what
my
money
has
averaged
for
the
last
twelve
months
and
how
much
a
week
do
you
think
it
comes
to
only
knows
said
owen
much
eighteen
bob
you
see
we
had
to
do
something
continued
easton
i
reckon
we
lucky
to
get
a
respectable
sort
of
chap
like
slyme
religious
and
teetotal
and
all
that
you
know
do
you
think
so
i
suppose
you
are
said
owen
who
although
he
intensely
disliked
slyme
knew
nothing
definite
against
him
they
worked
in
silence
for
some
time
and
then
owen
said
the
present
time
there
are
thousands
of
people
so
badly
off
that
compared
with
them
we
are
rich
their
sufferings
are
so
great
that
compared
with
them
we
may
be
said
to
be
living
in
luxury
you
know
that
do
you
that
true
enough
mate
we
really
ought
to
be
very
thankful
we
ought
to
consider
ourselves
lucky
to
a
inside
job
like
this
when
there
such
a
lot
of
chaps
walkin
about
doin
nothing
said
owen
lucky
although
we
in
a
condition
of
abject
miserable
poverty
we
must
consider
ourselves
lucky
that
not
actually
starving
owen
was
painting
the
door
easton
was
doing
the
skirting
this
work
caused
no
noise
so
they
were
able
to
converse
without
difficulty
you
think
it
right
for
us
to
tamely
make
up
our
minds
to
live
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
under
such
conditions
as
that
certainly
not
replied
easton
things
are
sure
to
get
better
presently
trade
has
always
been
as
bad
as
it
is
now
why
you
can
remember
as
well
as
i
can
a
few
years
ago
there
was
so
much
work
that
we
was
putting
in
fourteen
and
sixteen
hours
a
day
i
used
to
be
so
done
up
by
the
end
of
the
week
that
i
used
to
stay
in
bed
nearly
all
day
on
sunday
do
you
think
it
worth
while
trying
to
find
out
whether
possible
to
so
arrange
things
that
we
may
be
able
to
live
like
civilized
human
beings
without
being
alternately
worked
to
death
or
starved
do
see
how
we
goin
to
alter
things
answered
easton
the
present
time
from
what
i
hear
work
is
scarce
everywhere
we
ca
make
work
can
we
you
think
then
that
the
affairs
of
the
world
are
something
like
the
wind
or
the
weather
altogether
beyond
our
control
and
that
if
they
bad
we
can
do
nothing
but
just
sit
down
and
wait
for
them
to
get
better
i
do
see
we
can
odds
it
if
the
people
wot
got
the
money
wo
spend
it
the
likes
of
me
and
you
ca
make
can
we
owen
looked
curiously
at
easton
suppose
you
about
now
he
said
means
that
you
have
about
another
thirty
years
to
live
of
course
if
you
had
proper
food
and
clothes
and
had
to
work
more
than
a
reasonable
number
of
hours
every
day
there
is
no
natural
reason
why
you
should
not
live
for
another
fifty
or
sixty
years
but
we
say
thirty
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
able
to
contemplate
with
indifference
the
prospect
of
living
for
another
thirty
years
under
such
conditions
as
those
we
endure
at
present
easton
made
no
reply
you
were
to
commit
some
serious
breach
of
the
law
and
were
sentenced
next
week
to
ten
years
penal
servitude
you
probably
think
your
fate
a
very
pitiable
one
yet
you
appear
to
submit
quite
cheerfully
to
this
other
sentence
which
is
that
you
shall
die
a
premature
death
after
you
have
done
another
thirty
years
hard
labour
easton
continued
painting
the
skirting
there
no
work
owen
went
on
taking
another
dip
of
paint
as
he
spoke
and
starting
on
one
of
the
lower
panels
of
the
door
there
no
work
you
will
either
starve
or
get
into
debt
when
as
at
present
there
is
a
little
work
you
will
live
in
a
state
of
when
times
are
what
you
call
good
you
will
work
for
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
a
day
and
if
you
very
lucky
occasionally
all
night
the
extra
money
you
then
earn
will
go
to
pay
your
debts
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
get
credit
again
when
there
no
work
easton
put
some
putty
in
a
crack
in
the
skirting
consequence
of
living
in
this
manner
you
will
die
at
least
twenty
years
sooner
than
is
natural
or
should
you
have
an
unusually
strong
constitution
and
live
after
you
cease
to
be
able
to
work
you
will
be
put
into
a
kind
of
jail
and
treated
like
a
criminal
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
having
faced
up
the
cracks
easton
resumed
the
painting
of
the
skirting
it
were
proposed
to
make
a
law
that
all
working
men
and
women
were
to
be
put
to
death
smothered
or
hung
or
poisoned
or
put
into
a
lethal
chamber
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
age
of
fifty
years
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
you
would
join
in
the
uproar
of
protest
that
would
ensue
yet
you
submit
tamely
to
have
your
life
shortened
by
slow
starvation
overwork
lack
of
proper
boots
and
clothing
and
though
having
often
to
turn
out
and
go
to
work
when
you
are
so
ill
that
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
receiving
medical
care
easton
made
no
reply
he
knew
that
all
this
was
true
but
he
was
not
without
a
large
share
of
the
false
pride
which
prompts
us
to
hide
our
poverty
and
to
pretend
that
we
are
much
better
off
than
we
really
are
he
was
at
that
moment
wearing
the
pair
of
boots
that
ruth
had
bought
for
him
but
he
had
told
harlow
who
had
passed
some
remark
about
them
that
he
had
had
them
for
years
wearing
them
only
for
best
he
felt
very
resentful
as
he
listened
to
the
other
talk
and
owen
perceived
it
but
nevertheless
he
continued
the
present
system
is
altered
that
is
all
we
have
to
look
forward
to
and
yet
you
one
of
the
upholders
of
the
present
system
you
help
to
perpetuate
it
do
i
help
to
perpetuate
it
demanded
easton
not
trying
to
find
out
how
to
end
it
by
not
helping
those
who
are
trying
to
bring
a
better
state
of
things
into
existence
even
if
you
are
indifferent
to
your
own
fate
as
you
seem
to
be
you
have
no
right
to
be
indifferent
to
that
of
the
child
for
whose
existence
in
this
world
you
are
responsible
every
man
who
is
not
helping
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
for
the
future
is
helping
to
perpetuate
the
present
misery
and
is
therefore
the
enemy
of
his
own
children
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
neutral
we
must
either
help
or
hinder
as
owen
opened
the
door
to
paint
its
edge
bert
came
along
the
passage
out
he
cried
comin
up
the
road
be
in
a
minit
it
was
not
often
that
easton
was
glad
to
hear
of
the
approach
of
nimrod
but
on
this
occasion
he
heard
bert
message
with
a
sigh
of
relief
say
added
the
boy
in
a
whisper
to
owen
it
comes
orf
i
mean
if
you
gets
the
job
to
do
this
room
will
you
ask
to
me
along
of
you
all
right
sonny
replied
owen
and
bert
went
off
to
warn
the
others
that
he
had
been
observed
nimrod
sneaked
stealthily
into
the
house
and
began
softly
crawling
about
from
room
to
room
peeping
around
corners
and
squinting
through
the
cracks
of
doors
and
looking
through
keyholes
he
was
almost
pleased
to
see
that
everybody
was
very
hard
at
work
but
on
going
into
newman
room
misery
was
not
satisfied
with
the
progress
made
since
his
last
visit
the
fact
was
that
newman
had
been
forgetting
himself
again
this
morning
he
had
been
taking
a
little
pains
with
the
work
doing
it
something
like
properly
instead
of
scamping
and
rushing
it
in
the
usual
way
the
result
was
that
he
had
not
done
enough
know
newman
this
kind
of
thing
wo
do
nimrod
howled
must
get
over
a
bit
more
than
this
or
you
wo
suit
me
if
you
move
yourself
a
bit
quicker
i
shall
to
get
someone
else
been
in
this
room
since
seven
this
morning
and
it
dam
near
time
you
was
out
of
it
newman
muttered
something
about
being
nearly
finished
now
and
hunter
ascended
to
the
next
landing
the
attics
where
the
cheap
man
sawkins
the
labourer
was
at
work
harlow
had
been
taken
away
from
the
attics
to
go
on
with
some
of
the
better
work
so
sawkins
was
now
working
alone
he
had
been
slogging
into
it
like
a
trojan
and
had
done
quite
a
lot
he
had
painted
not
only
the
sashes
of
the
window
but
also
a
large
part
of
the
glass
and
when
doing
the
skirting
he
had
included
part
of
the
floor
sometimes
an
inch
sometimes
half
an
inch
the
paint
was
of
a
dark
drab
colour
and
the
surface
of
the
newly
painted
doors
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
corduroy
cloth
and
from
the
bottom
corners
of
nearly
every
panel
there
was
trickling
down
a
large
tear
as
if
the
doors
were
weeping
for
the
degenerate
condition
of
the
decorative
arts
but
these
tears
caused
no
throb
of
pity
in
the
bosom
of
misery
neither
did
the
surface
of
the
work
grate
upon
his
feelings
he
perceived
them
not
he
saw
only
that
there
was
a
lot
of
work
done
and
his
soul
was
filled
with
rapture
as
he
reflected
that
the
man
who
had
accomplished
all
this
was
paid
only
fivepence
an
hour
at
the
same
time
it
would
never
do
to
let
sawkins
know
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
progress
made
so
he
said
do
want
you
to
stand
too
much
over
this
up
you
know
sawkins
just
mop
it
over
anyhow
and
get
away
from
it
as
quick
as
you
can
right
sir
replied
sawkins
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
as
misery
began
crawling
downstairs
again
harlow
go
to
then
he
demanded
of
philpot
was
just
now
when
i
came
up
gorn
downstairs
sir
out
the
back
replied
joe
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
and
winking
at
hunter
be
back
in
a
mo
and
indeed
at
that
moment
harlow
was
just
coming
upstairs
again
we
ca
allow
this
kind
of
thing
in
workin
hours
you
know
hunter
bellowed
plenty
of
time
for
that
in
the
dinner
hour
nimrod
now
went
down
to
the
which
easton
and
owen
had
been
painting
he
stood
here
deep
in
thought
for
some
time
mentally
comparing
the
quantity
of
work
done
by
the
two
men
in
this
room
with
that
done
by
sawkins
in
the
attics
misery
was
not
a
painter
himself
he
was
a
carpenter
and
he
thought
but
little
of
the
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
work
to
him
it
was
all
about
the
same
just
plain
painting
believe
it
would
pay
us
a
great
deal
better
he
thought
to
himself
we
could
get
hold
of
a
few
more
lightweights
like
sawkins
and
with
his
mind
filled
with
this
reflection
he
shortly
afterwards
sneaked
stealthily
from
the
house
chapter
three
children
the
wages
of
intelligence
owen
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
dinner
hour
by
himself
in
the
making
pencil
sketches
in
his
and
taking
measurements
in
the
evening
after
leaving
off
instead
of
going
straight
home
as
usual
he
went
round
to
the
free
library
to
see
if
he
could
find
anything
concerning
moorish
decorative
work
in
any
of
the
books
there
although
it
was
only
a
small
and
institution
he
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
illustrations
of
several
examples
of
which
he
made
sketches
after
about
an
hour
spent
this
way
as
he
was
proceeding
homewards
he
observed
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
whose
appearance
seemed
familiar
they
were
standing
at
the
window
of
a
sweetstuff
shop
examining
the
wares
exposed
therein
as
owen
came
up
the
children
turned
round
and
they
recognized
each
other
simultaneously
they
were
charley
and
elsie
linden
owen
spoke
to
them
as
he
drew
near
and
the
boy
appealed
to
him
for
his
opinion
concerning
a
dispute
they
had
been
having
say
mister
which
do
you
think
is
the
best
a
fardensworth
of
everlasting
stickjaw
torfee
or
a
prize
packet
rather
have
a
prize
packet
replied
owen
unhesitatingly
i
told
you
so
cried
elsie
triumphantly
i
do
care
i
sooner
the
torfee
said
charley
doggedly
ca
you
agree
which
of
the
two
to
buy
no
it
not
that
replied
elsie
was
only
just
supposing
what
we
buy
if
we
a
fardin
but
we
not
really
goin
to
buy
nothing
because
we
ai
got
no
money
i
see
said
owen
i
think
have
some
money
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
produced
two
halfpennies
and
gave
one
to
each
of
the
children
who
immediately
went
in
to
buy
the
toffee
and
the
prize
packet
and
when
they
came
out
he
walked
along
with
them
as
they
were
going
in
the
same
direction
as
he
was
indeed
they
would
have
to
pass
by
his
house
your
grandfather
got
anything
to
do
yet
he
inquired
as
they
went
along
still
walkin
about
mister
replied
charley
when
they
reached
owen
door
he
invited
them
to
come
up
to
see
the
kitten
which
they
had
been
inquiring
about
on
the
way
frankie
was
delighted
with
these
two
visitors
and
whilst
they
were
eating
some
cakes
that
nora
gave
them
he
entertained
them
by
displaying
the
contents
of
his
toy
box
and
the
antics
of
the
kitten
which
was
the
best
toy
of
all
for
it
invented
new
games
all
the
time
acrobatic
performances
on
the
rails
of
chairs
curtain
climbing
running
slides
up
and
down
the
oilcloth
hiding
and
peeping
round
corners
and
under
the
sofa
the
kitten
cut
so
many
comical
capers
and
in
a
little
while
the
children
began
to
create
such
an
uproar
that
nora
had
to
interfere
lest
the
people
in
the
flat
underneath
should
be
annoyed
however
elsie
and
charley
were
not
able
to
stay
very
long
because
their
mother
would
be
anxious
about
them
but
they
promised
to
come
again
some
other
day
to
play
with
frankie
going

cried
charley
indignantly
about
the
time
you
dropped
the
quarter
of
butter
you
was
sent
for
in
the
mud
was
carelessness
that
was
an
accident
and
it
was
butter
at
all
it
was
margarine
so
there
eventually
it
was
arranged
that
they
were
to
carry
the
parcel
in
turns
elsie
to
have
first
innings
frankie
went
downstairs
to
the
front
door
with
them
to
see
them
off
and
as
they
went
down
the
street
he
shouted
after
them
you
remember
next
sunday
right
charley
shouted
back
sha
forget
on
thursday
owen
stayed
at
home
until
after
breakfast
to
finish
the
designs
which
he
had
promised
to
have
ready
that
morning
when
he
took
them
to
the
office
at
nine
the
hour
at
which
he
had
arranged
to
meet
rushton
the
latter
had
not
yet
arrived
and
he
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
until
half
an
hour
later
like
the
majority
of
people
who
do
brain
work
he
needed
a
great
deal
more
rest
than
those
who
do
only
mere
physical
labour
you
brought
them
sketches
i
suppose
he
remarked
in
a
surly
tone
as
he
came
in
know
there
was
no
need
for
you
to
wait
you
could
left
and
gone
on
to
your
job
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
looked
carelessly
at
the
drawing
that
owen
handed
to
him
it
was
on
a
sheet
of
paper
about
by
eighteen
inches
the
design
was
drawn
with
pencil
and
one
half
of
it
was
coloured
for
the
ceiling
said
owen
had
time
to
colour
all
of
it
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
rushton
laid
the
drawing
down
and
took
the
other
which
owen
handed
to
him
is
for
the
large
wall
the
same
design
would
be
adapted
for
the
other
walls
and
this
one
shows
the
door
and
the
panels
under
the
window
rushton
expressed
no
opinion
about
the
merits
of
the
drawings
he
examined
them
carelessly
one
after
the
other
and
then
laying
them
down
he
inquired
long
would
it
take
you
to
do
this
work
if
we
get
the
job
three
weeks
say
hours
that
is
the
decorative
work
only
of
course
the
walls
and
ceiling
would
have
to
be
painted
first
they
will
need
three
coats
of
white
rushton
scribbled
a
note
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
said
after
a
pause
can
leave
these
and
i
see
mr
sweater
about
it
and
tell
what
it
will
cost
and
if
he
decides
to
have
it
done
i
let
you
know
he
put
the
drawings
aside
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
other
matters
to
attend
to
and
began
to
open
one
of
the
several
letters
that
were
on
his
desk
he
meant
this
as
an
intimation
that
the
audience
was
at
an
end
and
that
he
desired
the
to
retire
from
the
presence
owen
understood
this
but
he
did
not
retire
because
it
was
necessary
to
mention
one
or
two
things
which
rushton
would
have
to
allow
for
when
preparing
the
estimate
course
i
should
want
some
help
he
said
should
need
a
man
occasionally
and
the
boy
most
of
the
time
then
there
the
gold
leaf
say
fifteen
books
you
think
it
would
be
possible
to
use
gold
paint
afraid
not
there
anything
else
inquired
rushton
as
he
finished
writing
down
these
items
think
that
all
except
a
few
sheets
of
cartridge
paper
for
stencils
and
working
drawings
the
quantity
of
paint
necessary
for
the
decorative
work
will
be
very
small
as
soon
as
owen
was
gone
rushton
took
up
the
designs
and
examined
them
attentively
are
all
right
he
muttered
enough
for
anywhere
if
he
can
paint
anything
like
as
well
as
this
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
it
will
stand
all
the
looking
at
that
anyone
in
this
town
is
likely
to
give
it
see
he
continued
said
three
weeks
but
he
so
anxious
to
do
the
job
that
he
most
likely
the
time
better
allow
four
weeks
that
means
about
hours
hours
at
how
much
is
that
and
say
he
has
a
painter
to
help
him
half
the
time
hours
at
he
consulted
a
ready
reckoner
that
was
on
the
desk
materials
fifteen
books
of
gold
say
a
pound
then
there
the
cartridge
paper
and
the
colours
say
another
pound
at
the
outside
boy
time
well
he
gets
no
wages
as
yet
so
we
mention
that
at
all
then
there
the
preparing
of
the
room
three
coats
of
white
paint
i
wish
hunter
was
here
to
give
me
an
idea
what
it
will
cost
as
if
in
answer
to
his
wish
nimrod
entered
the
office
at
that
moment
and
in
reply
to
rushton
query
said
that
to
give
the
walls
and
ceiling
three
coats
of
paint
would
cost
about
three
pounds
five
for
time
and
material
between
them
the
two
brain
workers
figured
that
fifteen
pounds
would
cover
the
entire
cost
of
the
work
painting
and
decorating
i
reckon
we
can
charge
sweater
pounds
for
it
said
rushton
is
like
an
ordinary
job
you
know
if
he
gets
a
london
firm
to
do
it
it
cost
him
double
that
if
not
more
having
arrived
at
this
decision
rushton
rung
up
sweater
emporium
on
the
telephone
and
finding
that
mr
sweater
was
there
he
rolled
up
the
designs
and
set
out
for
that
gentleman
office
the
men
work
with
their
hands
and
the
masters
work
with
their
brains
what
a
dreadful
calamity
it
would
be
for
the
world
and
for
mankind
if
all
these
brain
workers
were
to
go
on
strike
chapter
the
undeserving
persons
and
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
hunter
had
taken
on
three
more
painters
that
morning
bundy
and
two
labourers
had
commenced
the
work
of
putting
in
the
new
drains
the
carpenters
were
back
again
doing
some
extra
work
and
there
was
also
a
plumber
working
on
the
house
so
there
was
quite
a
little
crowd
in
the
kitchen
at
crass
had
been
waiting
for
a
suitable
opportunity
to
produce
the
newspaper
cutting
which
it
will
be
remembered
he
showed
to
easton
on
monday
morning
but
he
had
waited
in
vain
for
there
had
been
scarcely
any
talk
at
all
the
week
and
it
was
now
thursday
as
far
as
owen
was
concerned
his
thoughts
were
so
occupied
with
the
designs
for
the
that
he
had
no
time
for
anything
else
and
most
of
the
others
were
only
too
willing
to
avoid
a
subject
which
frequently
led
to
unpleasantness
as
a
rule
crass
himself
had
no
liking
for
such
discussion
but
he
was
so
confident
of
being
able
to
out
owen
with
the
cutting
from
the
obscurer
that
he
had
several
times
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
into
the
desired
channel
but
so
far
without
success
during
dinner
as
they
called
it
various
subjects
were
discussed
harlow
mentioned
that
he
had
found
traces
of
bugs
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
upstairs
and
this
called
forth
a
number
of
anecdotes
of
those
vermin
and
of
houses
infested
by
them
philpot
remembered
working
in
a
house
over
at
windley
the
people
who
lived
in
it
were
very
dirty
and
had
very
little
furniture
no
bedsteads
the
beds
consisting
of
dilapidated
mattresses
and
rags
on
the
floor
he
declared
that
these
ragged
mattresses
used
to
wander
about
the
rooms
by
themselves
the
house
was
so
full
of
fleas
that
if
one
placed
a
sheet
of
newspaper
on
the
floor
one
could
hear
and
see
them
jumping
on
it
in
fact
directly
one
went
into
that
house
one
was
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
fleas
during
the
few
days
he
worked
at
that
place
he
lost
several
pounds
in
weight
and
of
evenings
as
he
walked
homewards
the
children
and
people
in
the
streets
observing
his
ravaged
countenance
thought
he
was
suffering
from
some
disease
and
used
to
get
out
of
his
way
when
they
saw
him
coming
there
were
several
other
of
these
narratives
four
or
five
men
talking
at
the
top
of
their
voices
at
the
same
time
each
one
telling
a
different
story
at
first
each
addressed
himself
to
the
company
generally
but
after
a
while
finding
it
impossible
to
make
himself
heard
he
would
select
some
particular
individual
who
seemed
disposed
to
listen
and
tell
him
the
story
it
sometimes
happened
that
in
the
middle
of
the
tale
the
man
to
whom
it
was
being
told
would
remember
a
somewhat
similar
adventure
of
his
own
which
he
would
immediately
proceed
to
relate
without
waiting
for
the
other
to
finish
and
each
of
them
was
generally
so
interested
in
the
gruesome
details
of
his
own
story
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
the
other
was
telling
one
at
all
in
a
contest
of
this
kind
the
victory
usually
went
to
the
man
with
the
loudest
voice
but
sometimes
a
man
who
had
a
weak
voice
scored
by
repeating
the
same
tale
several
times
until
someone
heard
it
barrington
who
seldom
spoke
and
was
an
ideal
listener
was
appropriated
by
several
men
in
succession
who
each
told
him
a
different
yarn
there
was
one
man
sitting
on
an
pail
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
it
was
evident
from
the
movements
of
his
lips
that
he
also
was
relating
a
story
although
nobody
knew
what
it
was
about
or
heard
a
single
word
of
it
for
no
one
took
the
slightest
notice
of
him
when
the
uproar
had
subsided
harlow
remembered
the
case
of
a
family
whose
house
got
into
such
a
condition
that
the
landlord
had
given
them
notice
and
the
father
had
committed
suicide
because
the
painters
had
come
to
turn
out
of
house
and
home
there
were
a
man
his
wife
and
daughter
a
girl
about
seventeen
living
in
the
house
and
all
three
of
used
to
drink
like
hell
as
for
the
woman
she
could
shift
it
and
no
mistake
several
times
a
day
she
used
to
send
the
girl
with
a
jug
to
the
pub
at
the
corner
when
the
old
man
was
out
one
could
have
anything
one
liked
to
ask
for
from
either
of
for
half
a
pint
of
beer
but
for
his
part
said
harlow
he
could
never
fancy
it
they
were
both
too
ugly
the
finale
of
this
tale
was
received
with
a
burst
of
incredulous
laughter
by
those
who
heard
it
you
what
harlow
says
bob
easton
shouted
to
crass
what
was
it
ses
once
a
chance
to
something
but
would
take
it
on
because
it
was
too
ugly
it
bin
me
i
should
shut
me
bl
y
eyes
cried
sawkins
would
pass
it
for
a
trifle
like
that
said
crass
amid
laughter
you
can
bet
your
life
lose
it
neither
although
tries
to
make
out
to
be
so
innocent
always
though
old
harlow
was
a
bl
y
liar
remarked
bundy
now
we
knows
is
although
everyone
pretended
to
disbelieve
him
harlow
stuck
to
his
version
of
the
story
not
their
face
you
want
you
know
added
bundy
as
he
helped
himself
to
some
more
tea
know
it
was
my
old
woman
face
that
i
was
after
last
night
observed
crass
and
then
he
proceeded
amid
roars
of
laughter
to
give
a
minutely
detailed
account
of
what
had
taken
place
between
himself
and
his
wife
after
they
had
retired
for
the
night
this
story
reminded
the
man
on
the
pail
of
a
very
strange
dream
he
had
had
a
few
weeks
previously
dreamt
i
was
walkin
along
the
top
of
a
cliff
or
some
sich
place
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
ground
give
way
under
me
feet
and
i
began
to
slip
down
and
down
and
to
save
meself
from
going
over
i
made
a
grab
at
a
tuft
of
grass
as
was
growin
just
within
reach
of
me
and
then
i
thought
that
some
feller
was
me
on
the
with
a
bl
y
great
stick
and
tryin
to
make
me
let
go
of
the
tuft
of
grass
and
then
i
woke
up
to
find
my
old
woman
shouting
out
and
punchin
me
with
fists
she
said
i
was
pullin
while
the
room
was
in
an
uproar
with
the
merriment
induced
by
these
stories
crass
rose
from
his
seat
and
crossed
over
to
where
his
overcoat
was
hanging
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
and
took
from
the
pocket
a
piece
of
card
about
eight
inches
by
about
four
inches
one
side
of
it
was
covered
with
printing
and
as
he
returned
to
his
seat
crass
called
upon
the
others
to
listen
while
he
read
it
aloud
he
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
things
he
had
ever
seen
it
had
been
given
to
him
by
a
bloke
in
the
cricketers
the
other
night
crass
was
not
a
very
good
reader
but
he
was
able
to
read
this
all
right
because
he
had
read
it
so
often
that
he
almost
knew
it
by
heart
it
was
entitled
art
of
flatulence
and
it
consisted
of
a
number
of
rules
and
definitions
shouts
of
laughter
greeted
the
reading
of
each
paragraph
and
when
he
had
ended
the
piece
of
dirty
card
was
handed
round
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
wished
to
read
it
for
themselves
several
of
the
men
however
when
it
was
offered
to
them
refused
to
take
it
and
with
evident
disgust
suggested
that
it
should
be
put
into
the
fire
this
view
did
not
commend
itself
to
crass
who
after
the
others
had
finished
with
it
put
it
back
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
meanwhile
bundy
stood
up
to
help
himself
to
some
more
tea
the
cup
he
was
drinking
from
had
a
large
piece
broken
out
of
one
side
and
did
not
hold
much
so
he
usually
had
to
have
three
or
four
helpings
else
want
any
he
asked
several
cups
and
jars
were
passed
to
him
these
vessels
had
been
standing
on
the
floor
and
the
floor
was
very
dirty
and
covered
with
dust
so
before
dipping
them
into
the
pail
bundy
who
had
been
working
at
the
drains
all
morning
wiped
the
bottoms
of
the
jars
upon
his
trousers
on
the
same
place
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
wiping
his
hands
when
he
happened
to
get
some
dirt
on
them
he
filled
the
jars
so
full
that
as
he
held
them
by
the
rims
and
passed
them
to
their
owners
part
of
the
contents
slopped
over
and
trickled
through
his
fingers
by
the
time
he
had
finished
the
floor
was
covered
with
little
pools
of
tea
say
that
gord
made
everything
for
some
useful
purpose
remarked
harlow
reverting
to
the
original
subject
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
hell
the
use
of
sich
things
as
bugs
and
fleas
and
the
like
teach
people
to
keep
theirselves
clean
of
course
said
slyme
a
funny
subject
ai
it
continued
harlow
ignoring
answer
say
as
all
diseases
is
caused
by
little
insects
if
gord
made
no
cancer
germs
or
consumption
microbes
there
be
no
cancer
or
consumption
one
of
the
proofs
that
there
is
an
individual
god
said
owen
we
were
to
believe
that
the
universe
and
everything
that
lives
was
deliberately
designed
and
created
by
god
then
we
must
also
believe
that
he
made
his
disease
germs
you
are
speaking
of
for
the
purpose
of
torturing
his
other
creatures
ca
tell
me
a
bloody
yarn
like
that
interposed
crass
roughly
a
ruler
over
us
mate
and
so
you
likely
to
find
out
gord
did
create
the
world
did
it
come
demanded
slyme
know
no
more
about
that
than
you
do
replied
owen
is
i
know
nothing
the
only
difference
between
us
is
that
you
think
you
know
you
think
you
know
that
god
made
the
universe
how
long
it
took
him
to
do
it
why
he
made
it
how
long
it
been
in
existence
and
how
it
will
finally
pass
away
you
also
imagine
you
know
that
we
shall
live
after
we
dead
where
we
shall
go
and
the
kind
of
existence
we
shall
have
in
fact
in
the
excess
of
your
humility
you
think
you
know
all
about
it
but
really
you
know
no
more
of
these
things
than
any
other
human
being
does
that
is
you
know
nothing
only
your
opinion
said
slyme
we
care
to
take
the
trouble
to
learn
owen
went
on
can
know
a
little
of
how
the
universe
has
grown
and
changed
but
of
the
beginning
we
know
nothing
just
my
opinion
matey
observed
philpot
just
a
bloody
mystery
and
that
all
about
it
do
pretend
to
no
knowledge
said
slyme
knowledge
wo
save
a
man
soul
it
knowledge
as
does
that
i
knows
in
my
as
my
sins
is
all
hunder
the
blood
and
it
that
wot
given
and
the
peace
which
passes
all
understanding
to
me
ever
since
i
been
a
christian
glory
hallelujah
shouted
bundy
and
nearly
everyone
laughed
christian
is
right
sneered
owen
got
some
title
to
call
yourself
a
christian
have
you
as
for
the
happiness
that
passes
all
understanding
it
certainly
passes
my
understanding
how
you
can
be
happy
when
you
believe
that
millions
of
people
are
being
tortured
in
hell
and
it
also
passes
my
understanding
why
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourself
for
being
happy
under
such
circumstances
well
you
find
it
all
out
when
you
come
to
die
mate
replied
slyme
in
a
threatening
tone
think
and
talk
different
then
just
wot
gets
over
me
observed
harlow
do
seem
right
that
after
living
in
misery
and
poverty
all
our
bloody
lives
and
slavin
all
the
hours
that
gord
sends
that
we
to
be
bloody
well
set
fire
and
burned
in
for
all
eternity
it
seem
feasible
to
me
you
know
my
belief
said
philpot
profoundly
when
you
dead
you
done
for
that
the
end
of
you
what
say
remarked
easton
for
all
this
religious
business
it
just
a
dodge
it
the
parson
trade
just
the
same
as
painting
is
ours
only
there
no
work
attached
to
it
and
the
pay
a
bloody
sight
better
than
ours
is
their
livin
and
a
bloody
good
livin
too
if
you
ask
me
said
bundy
said
harlow
lives
on
the
fat
o
the
land
and
wears
the
best
of
everything
and
they
does
nothing
for
it
but
talk
a
lot
of
twaddle
two
or
three
times
a
week
the
rest
of
the
time
they
spend
cadgin
money
orf
silly
old
women
who
thinks
it
a
sorter
fire
insurance
an
old
sayin
and
a
true
one
chimed
in
the
man
on
the
upturned
pail
and
publicans
is
the
worst
enemies
the
workin
man
ever
there
may
be
some
good
but
they
few
and
far
between
i
could
only
get
a
job
like
the
harchbishop
of
canterbury
said
philpot
solemnly
leave
this
firm
would
i
said
harlow
i
was
the
harchbishop
of
canterbury
take
my
pot
and
brushes
down
the
office
and
shy
through
the
bloody
winder
and
tell
ole
misery
to
go
to
is
a
thing
that
do
trouble
me
much
remarked
newman
as
for
what
happens
to
you
after
death
it
a
thing
i
believe
in
leavin
till
you
comes
to
it
there
no
sense
in
meetin
trouble
all
the
things
they
tells
us
may
be
true
or
they
may
not
but
it
takes
me
all
my
time
to
look
after
this
world
i
do
believe
been
to
church
more
than
arf
a
dozen
times
since
i
been
married
that
over
fifteen
years
ago
now
and
then
it
been
when
the
kids
been
christened
the
old
woman
goes
sometimes
and
of
course
the
young
goes
you
got
to
tell
something
or
other
and
they
might
as
well
learn
what
they
teaches
at
the
sunday
school
as
anything
else
a
general
murmur
of
approval
greeted
this
it
seemed
to
be
the
almost
unanimous
opinion
that
whether
it
were
true
or
not
was
a
nice
thing
to
teach
children
not
been
even
once
since
i
was
married
said
harlow
i
sometimes
wish
to
christ
i
gorn
then
do
see
as
it
matters
a
dam
wot
a
man
believes
said
philpot
long
as
you
do
do
no
to
nobody
if
you
see
a
poor
b
r
down
on
luck
give
a
even
if
you
ai
got
no
money
you
can
say
a
kind
word
if
a
man
does
work
and
looks
arter
and
young
and
does
a
good
turn
to
a
fellow
creature
when
can
i
reckon
stands
as
much
chance
of
getting
into
if
there
is
sich
a
place
as
some
of
there
whether
ever
goes
to
church
or
chapel
or
not
these
sentiments
were
echoed
by
everyone
with
the
solitary
exception
of
slyme
who
said
that
philpot
would
find
out
his
mistake
after
he
was
dead
when
he
would
have
to
stand
before
the
great
white
throne
for
judgement
at
the
last
day
when
yer
sees
the
moon
turned
inter
blood
be
cryin
hout
for
the
mountings
and
the
rocks
to
fall
on
yer
and
yer
from
the
wrath
of
the
lamb
the
others
laughed
derisively
a
bush
baptist
meself
remarked
the
man
on
the
upturned
pail
this
individual
dick
wantley
by
name
was
of
what
is
usually
termed
a
cast
of
countenance
he
reminded
one
strongly
of
an
ancient
gargoyle
or
a
dragon
most
of
the
hands
had
by
now
lit
their
pipes
but
there
were
a
few
who
preferred
chewing
their
tobacco
as
they
smoked
or
chewed
they
expectorated
upon
the
floor
or
into
the
fire
wantley
was
one
of
those
who
preferred
chewing
and
he
had
been
spitting
upon
the
floor
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
by
this
time
partly
surrounded
by
a
kind
of
semicircular
moat
of
dark
brown
spittle
a
bush
baptist
he
shouted
across
the
moat
you
all
knows
wot
that
is
this
confession
of
faith
caused
a
fresh
outburst
of
hilarity
because
of
course
everyone
knew
what
a
bush
baptist
was
goin
to
be
full
of
sich
b
r
as
hunter
observed
eaton
think
i
rather
go
to
the
other
place
ever
ole
misery
does
get
into
said
philpot
wo
stop
there
very
long
i
reckon
be
chucked
out
of
it
before
been
there
a
week
because
sure
to
start
pinchin
the
jewels
out
of
the

saints
crowns
if
they
wo
in

sure
i
do
know
wot
to
become
of
said
harlow
with
pretended
concern
i
believe
be
allowed
into
now
not
demanded
bundy
should
think
it
just
the
bloody
place
for
sich
b

as
it
used
to
be
at
one
time
o
day
but
they
changed
all
that
now
they
a
revolution
down
there
deposed
the
devil
elected
a
parson
as
president
and
started
puttin
the
fire
out
what
i
hears
of
it
continued
harlow
when
the
laughter
had
ceased
is
a
bloody
fine
place
to
live
in
just
now
underground
railways
and
trams
and
at
the
corner
of
nearly
every
street
there
a
sort
of
pub
where
you
can
buy
lemon
squash
four
ale
and
american
cold
drinks
and
you
allowed
to
sit
in
a
refrigerator
for
two
hours
for
a
tanner
although
they
laughed
and
made
fun
of
these
things
the
reader
must
not
think
that
they
really
doubted
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
because
although
they
had
all
been
brought
up
by
parents
and
had
been
in
schools
none
of
them
knew
enough
about
christianity
to
either
really
believe
it
or
disbelieve
it
the
imposters
who
obtain
a
comfortable
living
by
pretending
to
be
the
ministers
and
disciples
of
the
workman
of
nazareth
are
too
cunning
to
encourage
their
dupes
to
acquire
anything
approaching
an
intelligent
understanding
of
the
subject
they
do
not
want
people
to
know
or
understand
anything
they
want
them
to
have
faith
to
believe
without
knowledge
understanding
or
evidence
for
years
harlow
and
his
mates
when
children
had
been
in
day
school
sunday
school
and
in
church
or
chapel
and
now
they
knew
practically
nothing
about
it
but
they
were
all
the
same
they
believed
that
the
bible
was
the
word
of
god
but
they
did
know
where
it
came
from
how
long
it
had
been
in
existence
who
wrote
it
who
translated
it
or
how
many
different
versions
there
were
most
of
them
were
almost
totally
unacquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
book
itself
but
all
the
same
they
believed
it
after
a
fashion
puttin
all
jokes
aside
said
philpot
ca
believe
sich
a
place
as
there
may
be
some
kind
of
punishment
but
i
do
believe
it
a
real
fire
nobody
else
what
got
any
sense
replied
harlow
contemptuously
believe
as
this
world
is
said
crass
looking
around
with
a
philosophic
expression
this
opinion
was
echoed
by
most
of
the
others
although
slyme
remained
silent
and
owen
laughed
the
bloody
are
you
laughin
at
crass
demanded
in
an
indignant
tone
was
laughing
because
you
said
you
think
this
world
is
hell
i
do
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
that
said
crass
it
is
a
said
easton
ca
be
anywheres
much
worse
than
this
said
the
man
behind
the
moat
i
was
laughing
at
is
this
said
owen
present
system
of
managing
the
affairs
of
the
world
is
so
bad
and
has
produced
such
dreadful
results
that
you
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
earth
is
a
hell
and
yet
you
are
a
conservative
you
wish
to
preserve
the
present
system
the
system
which
has
made
the
world
into
a
hell
thought
we
should
get
through
the
dinner
hour
without
politics
if
owen
was
growled
bundy
sickenin
i
call
it
be
on
said
philpot
been
very
quiet
for
the
last
few
days
to
go
through
it
today
though
remarked
harlow
despairingly
can
see
it
comin
not
goin
through
it
said
bundy
orf
and
he
accordingly
drank
the
remainder
of
his
tea
closed
his
empty
dinner
basket
and
having
placed
it
on
the
mantelshelf
made
for
the
door
leave
you
to
it
he
said
as
he
went
out
the
others
laughed
crass
remembering
the
cutting
from
the
obscurer
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
was
secretly
very
pleased
at
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
he
turned
roughly
on
owen
other
day
when
we
was
talkin
about
the
cause
of
poverty
you
contradicted
everybody
everyone
else
was
wrong
but
you
yourself
could
tell
us
what
the
cause
of
poverty
could
you
think
i
could
of
course
you
think
you
know
sneered
crass
of
course
you
think
your
opinion
right
and
everybody
else
is
wrong
replied
owen
several
men
expressed
their
abhorrence
of
this
intolerant
attitude
of
owen
but
the
latter
rejoined
course
i
think
that
my
opinions
are
right
and
that
everyone
who
differs
from
me
is
wrong
if
i
did
think
their
opinions
were
wrong
i
would
differ
from
them
if
i
did
think
my
own
opinions
right
i
would
hold
them
there
no
need
to
keep
on
arguin
about
it
day
after
day
said
crass
got
your
opinion
and
i
got
mine
let
everyone
enjoy
his
own
opinion
i
say
a
murmur
of
approbation
from
the
crowd
greeted
these
sentiments
but
owen
rejoined
we
ca
both
be
right
if
your
opinions
are
right
and
mine
are
not
how
am
i
to
find
out
the
truth
if
we
never
talk
about
them
wot
do
you
reckon
is
the
cause
of
poverty
then
demanded
easton
present
system
competition
capitalism
all
very
well
to
talk
like
that
snarled
crass
to
whom
this
statement
conveyed
no
meaning
whatever
do
you
make
it
out
i
put
it
like
that
for
the
sake
of
shortness
replied
owen
some
people
were
living
in
a
house
supposin
sneered
crass
suppose
they
were
always
ill
and
suppose
that
the
house
was
badly
built
the
walls
so
constructed
that
they
drew
and
retained
moisture
the
roof
broken
and
leaky
the
drains
defective
the
doors
and
windows
and
the
rooms
badly
shaped
and
draughty
if
you
were
asked
to
name
in
a
word
the
cause
of
the
of
the
people
who
lived
there
you
would
say
the
house
all
the
tinkering
in
the
world
would
not
make
that
house
fit
to
live
in
the
only
thing
to
do
with
it
would
be
to
pull
it
down
and
build
another
well
we
all
living
in
a
house
called
the
money
system
and
as
a
result
most
of
us
are
suffering
from
a
disease
called
poverty
there
so
much
the
matter
with
the
present
system
that
it
no
good
tinkering
at
it
everything
about
it
is
wrong
and
there
nothing
about
it
that
right
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
with
it
and
that
is
to
smash
it
up
and
have
a
different
system
altogether
we
must
get
out
of
it
seems
to
me
that
that
just
what
you
trying
to
do
remanded
harlow
sarcastically
seem
to
be
tryin
to
get
out
of
answering
the
question
what
easton
asked
you
cried
crass
fiercely
do
you
answer
the
bloody
question
wot
the
cause
of
poverty
the
the
matter
with
the
present
system
demanded
sawkins
it
goin
to
be
altered
said
newman
the
bloody
sort
of
a
system
do
you
think
we
ought
to
shouted
the
man
behind
the
moat
ca
never
be
altered
said
philpot
nature
human
nature
and
you
ca
get
away
from
it
mind
about
human
nature
shouted
crass
to
the
point
wot
the
cause
of
poverty
b
r
the
cause
of
poverty
said
one
of
the
new
hands
enough
of
this
bloody
row
and
he
stood
up
and
prepared
to
go
out
of
the
room
this
individual
had
two
patches
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
of
that
garment
were
frayed
and
ragged
he
had
been
out
of
work
for
about
six
weeks
previous
to
having
been
taken
on
by
rushton
during
most
of
that
time
he
and
his
family
had
been
existing
in
a
condition
of
on
the
earnings
of
his
wife
as
a
charwoman
and
on
the
scraps
of
food
she
brought
home
from
the
houses
where
she
worked
but
all
the
same
the
question
of
what
is
the
cause
of
poverty
had
no
interest
for
him
are
many
causes
answered
owen
they
are
all
part
of
and
inseparable
from
the
system
in
order
to
do
away
with
poverty
we
must
destroy
the
causes
to
do
away
with
the
causes
we
must
destroy
the
whole
system
are
the
causes
then
money
for
one
thing
this
extraordinary
assertion
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
merriment
in
the
midst
of
which
philpot
was
heard
to
say
that
to
listen
to
owen
was
as
good
as
going
to
a
circus
money
was
the
cause
of
poverty
always
thought
it
was
the
want
of
it
said
the
man
with
the
patches
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
as
he
passed
out
of
the
door
things
continued
owen
private
ownership
of
land
private
ownership
of
railways
tramways
gasworks
waterworks
private
ownership
of
factories
and
the
other
means
of
producing
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
competition
in
business
do
you
make
it
out
demanded
crass
impatiently
owen
hesitated
to
his
mind
the
thing
appeared
very
clear
and
simple
the
causes
of
poverty
were
so
glaringly
evident
that
he
marvelled
that
any
rational
being
should
fail
to
perceive
them
but
at
the
same
time
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
define
them
himself
he
could
not
think
of
words
that
would
convey
his
thoughts
clearly
to
these
others
who
seemed
so
hostile
and
unwilling
to
understand
and
who
appeared
to
have
made
up
their
minds
to
oppose
and
reject
whatever
he
said
they
did
not
know
what
were
the
causes
of
poverty
and
apparently
they
did
not
want
to
know
i
try
to
show
you
one
of
the
causes
he
said
nervously
at
last
he
picked
up
a
piece
of
charred
wood
that
had
fallen
from
the
fire
and
knelt
down
and
began
to
draw
upon
the
floor
most
of
the
others
regarded
him
with
looks
in
which
an
indulgent
contemptuous
kind
of
interest
mingled
with
an
air
of
superiority
and
patronage
there
was
no
doubt
they
thought
that
owen
was
a
clever
sort
of
chap
his
work
proved
that
but
he
was
certainly
a
little
bit
mad
by
this
time
owen
had
drawn
a
circle
about
two
feet
in
diameter
inside
he
had
drawn
two
squares
one
much
larger
than
the
other
these
two
squares
he
filled
in
solid
black
with
the
charcoal
it
all
about
asked
crass
with
a
sneer
ca
you
see
said
philpot
with
a
wink
goin
to
do
some
conjurin
in
a
minit
make
something
pass
out
o
one
o
them
squares
into
the
other
and
no
one
wo
see
it
done
when
he
had
finished
drawing
owen
remained
for
a
few
minutes
awkwardly
silent
oppressed
by
the
anticipation
of
ridicule
and
a
sense
of
his
inability
to
put
his
thoughts
into
plain
language
he
began
to
wish
that
he
had
not
undertaken
this
task
at
last
with
an
effort
he
began
to
speak
in
a
halting
nervous
way
circle
or
rather
the
space
inside
the
circle
is
supposed
to
represent
england
i
never
knowed
it
was
round
before
jeered
crass
heard
as
the
world
is
round
never
said
it
was
the
shape
i
said
it
was
supposed
to
represent

i
see
i
thought
we
very
soon
begin
supposin
two
black
squares
continued
owen
the
people
who
live
in
the
country
the
small
square
represents
a
few
thousand
people
the
large
square
stands
for
the
remainder
about
forty
millions
that
is
the
majority
ai
sich
bloody
fools
as
to
think
that
the
largest

is

for
their

and
in
return
for
their
labour
they
receive
money
some
more
some
less
than

do
think
they
be
sich
bloody
fools
as
to
work
for
nothing
do
you
said
newman
suppose
you
think
they
ought
all
to
get
the
same
wages
cried
harlow
you
think
it
right
that
a
scavenger
should
get
as
much
as
a
painter
not
speaking
about
that
at
all
replied
owen
trying
to
show
you
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
causes
of
poverty
up
ca
you
harlow
remonstrated
philpot
who
began
to
feel
interested
ca
all
talk
at
once
know
we
ca
replied
harlow
in
an
aggrieved
tone
takes
sich
a
of
a
time
to
say
wot
got
to
say
nobody
else
get
a
word
in
edgeways
order
that
these
people
may
live
continued
owen
pointing
to
the
large
black
square
is
first
necessary
that
they
shall
have
a
place
to
live
in
i
should
never
a
thought
it
exclaimed
the
man
on
the
pail
pretending
to
be
much
impressed
the
others
laughed
and
two
or
three
of
them
went
out
of
the
room
contemptuously
remarking
to
each
other
in
an
audible
undertone
as
they
went
rot
wot
the
bloody
thinks
is
a
sort
of
schoolmaster
owen
nervousness
increased
as
he
continued
they
ca
live
in
the
air
or
in
the
sea
these
people
are
land
animals
therefore
they
must
live
on
the
land
do
yer
mean
by
animals
demanded
slyme
human
bean
ai
a

said
crass
indignantly
we
are
cried
harlow
into
any
chemist
shop
you
like
and
ask
the
bloke
and
tell
you
blow
that
interrupted
philpot
wot
owen
sayin
must
live
on
the
land
and
that
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
because
under
the
present
system
the
majority
of
the
people
have
really
no
right
to
be
in
the
country
at
all
under
the
present
system
the
country
belongs
to
a
few
those
who
are
here
represented
by
this
small
black
square
if
it
would
pay
them
to
do
so
and
if
they
felt
so
disposed
these
few
people
have
a
perfect
right
under
the
present
system
to
order
everyone
else
to
clear
out
they
do
do
that
they
allow
the
majority
to
remain
in
the
land
on
one
condition
that
is
they
must
pay
rent
to
the
few
for
the
privilege
of
being
permitted
to
live
in
the
land
of
their
birth
the
amount
of
rent
demanded
by
those
who
own
this
country
is
so
large
that
in
order
to
pay
it
the
greater
number
of
the
majority
have
often
to
deprive
themselves
and
their
children
not
only
of
the
comforts
but
even
the
necessaries
of
life
in
the
case
of
the
working
classes
the
rent
absorbs
at
the
lowest
possible
estimate
about
of
their
total
earnings
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
rent
is
an
expense
that
goes
on
all
the
time
whether
they
are
employed
or
not
if
they
get
into
arrears
when
out
of
work
they
have
to
pay
double
when
they
get
employment
again
majority
work
hard
and
live
in
poverty
in
order
that
the
minority
may
live
in
luxury
without
working
at
all
and
as
the
majority
are
mostly
fools
they
not
only
agree
to
pass
their
lives
in
incessant
slavery
and
want
in
order
to
pay
this
rent
to
those
who
own
the
country
but
they
say
it
is
quite
right
that
they
should
have
to
do
so
and
are
very
grateful
to
the
little
minority
for
allowing
them
to
remain
in
the
country
at
all
owen
paused
and
immediately
there
arose
a
great
clamour
from
his
listeners
it
is
right
ai
it
shouted
crass
you
a

let
it
to
someone
you
want
your
rent

yer
suppose

he
added
got
common
honesty
nearly
everyone
had
something
to
say
in
reprobation
of
the
views
suggested
by
owen
harlow
in
a
brief
but
powerful
speech
bristling
with
numerous
sanguinary
references
to
the
bottomless
pit

against

interference
with

easton
listened
with
a
puzzled
expression
and
philpot
goggle
eyes
rolled
horribly
as
he
glared
silently
at
the
circle
and
the
two
squares

the
greatest
part
of

owen
when
the
row
had
ceased

by
people
who
have
absolutely
no

right
to

of

obtained
by

continued
as
he
took
a
small
newspaper
cutting
from
his
crass
looked
at
the
piece
of
paper
dolefully
it
reminded
him
of
the
one
he
had
in
his

was

hundredth
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
ballcartridge
occurred
yesterday
and
in
accordance
with
custom
the
duke
of
ballcartridge
handed
to
the
authorities
the
little
flag
which
he
annually
presents
to
the
state
in
virtue
of
his
tenure
of
the
vast
tract
of
this
country
which
was
presented
to
one
of
his

in

his
salary
for
his

at
the

is
the

has
to

also
presents
the

with
a
little
coloured
silk
flag
every
year
in
return
for
being
allowed
to
retain
possession
of
that
part
of
england
which
was
presented
in
addition
to
his
salary
to
one
of
his
grace
very
remote
ancestors
for
his
services
at
the
battle
of
commissariat
in
the
netherlands
duke
of
southward
is
another
instance
continued
owen
owns
miles
of
the
country
we
speak
of
as
ours
much
of
his
part
consists
of
confiscated
monastery
lands
which
were
stolen
from
the
owners
by
king
henry
viii
and
presented
to
the
ancestors
of
the
present
duke
it
was
right
or
wrong
that
these
parts
of
our
country
should
ever
have
been
given
to
those
people
the
question
whether
those
ancestor
persons
were
really
deserving
cases
or
not
is
a
thing
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
now
but
the
present
holders
are
certainly
not
deserving
people
they
do
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
pretend
they
are
they
have
done
nothing
and
they
do
nothing
to
justify
their
possession
of
these
estates
as
they
call
them
and
in
my
opinion
no
man
who
is
in
his
right
mind
can
really
think
it
just
that
these
people
should
be
allowed
to
prey
upon
their
fellow
men
as
they
are
doing
now
or
that
it
is
right
that
their
children
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
prey
upon
our
children
for
ever
the
thousands
of
people
on
those
estates
work
and
live
in
poverty
in
order
that
these
three
men
and
their
families
may
enjoy
leisure
and
luxury
just
think
of
the
absurdity
of
it
continued
owen
pointing
to
the
drawings
those
people
allowing
themselves
to
be
overworked
and
bullied
and
starved
and
robbed
by
this
little
crowd
here
observing
signs
of
a
renewal
of
the
storm
of
protests
owen
hurriedly
concluded
it
right
or
wrong
you
ca
deny
that
the
fact
that
this
small
minority
possesses
nearly
all
the
land
of
the
country
is
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
poverty
of
the
majority
that
seems
true
enough
said
easton
slowly
rent
the
biggest
item
a
workin
man
got
to
pay
when
you
out
of
work
and
you
ca
afford
other
things
you
goes
without
but
the
rent
to
be
paid
whether
you
workin
or
not
that
true
enough
said
harlow
impatiently
you
gets
value
for
yer
money
you
ca
expect
to
get
a
for
nothing
we
admits
as
it
wrong
just
for
the
sake
of
argyment
said
crass
in
a
jeering
tone
then
wot
about
it
it
agoin
to
be
altered
cried
harlow
triumphantly
the
bloody
question
it
goin
to
be
altered
it
ca
be
done
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
satisfaction
nearly
everyone
seemed
very
pleased
to
think
that
the
existing
state
of
things
could
not
possibly
be
altered
it
can
be
altered
or
not
whether
it
right
or
wrong
landlordism
is
one
of
the
causes
of
poverty
owen
repeated
is
not
caused
by
men
and
women
getting
married
it
not
caused
by
machinery
it
not
caused
by
it
not
caused
by
drink
or
laziness
and
it
not
caused
by
caused
by
private
monopoly
that
is
the
present
system
they
have
monopolized
everything
that
it
is
possible
to
monopolize
they
have
got
the
whole
earth
the
minerals
in
the
earth
and
the
streams
that
water
the
earth
the
only
reason
they
have
not
monopolized
the
daylight
and
the
air
is
that
it
is
not
possible
to
do
it
if
it
were
possible
to
construct
huge
gasometers
and
to
draw
together
and
compress
within
them
the
whole
of
the
atmosphere
it
would
have
been
done
long
ago
and
we
should
have
been
compelled
to
work
for
them
in
order
to
get
money
to
buy
air
to
breathe
and
if
that
seemingly
impossible
thing
were
accomplished
tomorrow
you
would
see
thousands
of
people
dying
for
want
of
air
or
of
the
money
to
buy
it
even
as
now
thousands
are
dying
for
want
of
the
other
necessities
of
life
you
would
see
people
going
about
gasping
for
breath
and
telling
each
other
that
the
likes
of
them
could
not
expect
to
have
air
to
breathe
unless
they
had
the
money
to
pay
for
it
most
of
you
here
for
instance
would
think
and
say
so
even
as
you
think
at
present
that
it
right
for
so
few
people
to
own
the
earth
the
minerals
and
the
water
which
are
all
just
as
necessary
as
is
the
air
in
exactly
the
same
spirit
as
you
now
say
it
their
land
it
their
water
it
their
coal
it
their
iron
so
you
would
say
it
their
air
these
are
their
gasometers
and
what
right
have
the
likes
of
us
to
expect
them
to
allow
us
to
breathe
for
nothing
and
even
while
he
is
doing
this
the
air
monopolist
will
be
preaching
sermons
on
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
will
be
dispensing
advice
on
christian
duty
in
the
sunday
magazines
he
will
give
utterance
to
numerous
more
or
less
moral
maxims
for
the
guidance
of
the
young
and
meantime
all
around
people
will
be
dying
for
want
of
some
of
the
air
that
he
will
have
bottled
up
in
his
gasometers
and
when
you
are
all
dragging
out
a
miserable
existence
gasping
for
breath
or
dying
for
want
of
air
if
one
of
your
number
suggests
smashing
a
hole
in
the
side
of
one
of
the
gasometers
you
will
all
fall
upon
him
in
the
name
of
law
and
order
and
after
doing
your
best
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
you
drag
him
covered
with
blood
in
triumph
to
the
nearest
police
station
and
deliver
him
up
to
justice
in
the
hope
of
being
given
a
few
of
air
for
your
trouble
suppose
you
think
the
landlords
ought
to
let
people
live
in
their
for
nothing
said
crass
breaking
the
silence
that
followed
remarked
harlow
pretending
to
be
suddenly
converted
to
owen
views
reckon
the
landlord
ought
to
pay
the
rent
to
the
tenant
course
landlordism
is
not
the
only
cause
said
owen
ignoring
these
remarks
wonderful
system
fosters
a
great
many
others
employers
of
labour
for
instance
are
as
great
a
cause
of
poverty
as
landlords
are
this
extraordinary
statement
was
received
with
astonished
silence
you
mean
to
say
that
if
i
out
of
work
and
a
master
gives
me
a
job
that
doin
me
a
injury
said
crass
at
length
of
course
not
replied
owen
what
the
bloody
do
yer
mean
then
mean
this
supposing
that
the
owner
of
a
house
wishes
to
have
it
repainted
what
does
he
usually
do
a
rule
goes
to
three
or
four
master
painters
and
asks
to
give
a
price
for
the
job
and
those
master
painters
are
so
eager
to
get
the
work
that
they
cut
the
price
down
to
what
they
think
is
the
lowest
possible
point
answered
owen
the
lowest
usually
gets
the
job
the
successful
tenderer
has
usually
cut
the
price
so
fine
that
to
make
it
pay
he
has
to
scamp
the
work
pay
low
wages
and
drive
and
sweat
the
men
whom
he
employs
he
wants
them
to
do
two
days
work
for
one
day
pay
the
result
is
that
a
job
which
if
it
were
done
properly
would
employ
say
twenty
men
for
two
months
is
rushed
and
scamped
in
half
that
time
with
half
that
number
of
men
means
that
in
one
such
case
as
this
ten
men
are
deprived
of
one
month
employment
and
ten
other
men
are
deprived
of
two
employment
and
all
because
the
employers
have
been
cutting
each
other
throats
to
get
the
work
we
ca
ourselves
you
nor
me
either
said
harlow
one
of
us
on
this
job
was
to
make
up
mind
not
to
tear
into
it
like
we
do
but
just
keep
on
steady
and
do
a
fair
day
work
wot
would
no
one
answered
but
the
same
thought
was
in
everyone
mind
such
a
one
would
be
quickly
marked
by
hunter
and
even
if
the
latter
failed
to
notice
it
would
not
be
long
before
crass
reported
his
conduct
ca
ourselves
said
easton
gloomily
one
man
wo
do
it
there
twenty
others
ready
to
take
place
could
help
ourselves
to
a
certain
extent
if
we
would
stand
by
each
other
if
for
instance
we
all
belonged
to
the
society
said
owen
do
believe
in
the
society
observed
crass
ca
see
as
right
that
a
inferior
man
should
the
same
wages
as
me
a
drunken
lot
of
remarked
slyme
why
they
always
their
meetings
in
public
harlow
made
no
comment
on
this
question
he
had
at
one
time
belonged
to
the
union
and
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
having
fallen
away
from
it
good
the
society
ever
done
said
easton
that
i
ever
of
might
be
able
to
do
some
good
if
most
of
us
belonged
to
it
but
after
all
that
another
matter
whether
we
could
help
ourselves
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
we
do
but
you
must
admit
that
this
competition
of
the
employers
is
one
of
the
causes
of
unemployment
and
poverty
because
it
not
only
in
our
line
exactly
the
same
thing
happens
in
every
other
trade
and
industry
competing
employers
are
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
which
grind
the
workers
between
them
suppose
you
think
there
ought
to
be
no
employers
at
all
sneered
crass
you
think
the
masters
ought
to
do
all
the
bloody
work
theirselves
and
give
us
the
money
do
see
its
goin
to
be
altered
remarked
harlow
must
be
masters
and
someone
to
take
charge
of
the
work
and
do
the
thinkin
it
can
be
altered
or
not
said
owen
and
competing
employers
are
two
of
the
causes
of
poverty
but
of
course
they
only
a
small
part
of
the
system
which
produces
luxury
refinement
and
culture
for
a
few
and
condemns
the
majority
to
a
lifelong
struggle
with
adversity
and
many
thousands
to
degradation
hunger
and
rags
this
is
the
system
you
all
uphold
and
defend
although
you
do
mind
admitting
that
it
has
made
the
world
into
a
hell
crass
slowly
drew
the
obscurer
cutting
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
after
a
moment
thought
he
replaced
it
deciding
to
defer
its
production
till
a
more
suitable
occasion
you
told
us
yet
you
makes
out
that
money
causes
poverty
cried
harlow
winking
at
the
others
what
anxious
to
about
am
i
remarked
the
man
behind
the
moat
was
just
wondering
whether
i
better
tell
ole
misery
that
i
do
want
no
wages
this
week
think
i
tell
on
saterday
to
keep
my
money
and
get
a
few
drinks
with
it
said
philpot
might
cheer
up
a
bit
and
make
a
little
more
sociable
and
friendly
like
is
the
principal
cause
of
poverty
said
owen
do
yer
make
it
out
cried
sawkins
but
their
curiosity
had
to
remain
unsatisfied
for
the
time
being
because
crass
announced
that
it
was
on
it
chapter
true
freedom
about
three
that
afternoon
rushton
suddenly
appeared
and
began
walking
silently
about
the
house
and
listening
outside
the
doors
of
rooms
where
the
hands
were
working
he
did
not
succeed
in
catching
anyone
idling
or
smoking
or
talking
the
nearest
approach
to
what
the
men
called
capture
that
he
made
was
as
he
stood
outside
the
door
of
one
of
the
upper
rooms
in
which
philpot
and
harlow
were
working
he
heard
them
singing
one
of
sankey
hymns
for
the
night
is
coming
he
listened
to
two
verses
and
several
repetitions
of
the
chorus
being
a
he
could
scarcely
object
to
this
especially
as
by
peeping
through
the
partly
open
door
he
could
see
that
they
were
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
when
he
went
into
the
room
they
glanced
around
to
see
who
it
was
and
stopped
singing
rushton
did
not
speak
but
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
silently
watching
them
as
they
worked
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
without
having
uttered
a
syllable
he
turned
and
went
out
they
heard
him
softly
descend
the
stairs
and
harlow
turning
to
philpot
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
do
you
think
of
the
b
r
standing
there
watchin
us
like
that
as
if
we
was
a
couple
of
bloody
convicts
if
it
was
that
i
got
someone
else
beside
myself
to
think
of
i
would
sloshed
the
bloody
sod
in
the
mouth
with
this
pound
brush
it
does
make
yer
feel
like
that
mate
replied
philpot
of
course
we
must
give
way
to
it
times
continued
harlow
who
was
livid
with
anger
was
on
the
point
of
turnin
round
and
sayin
to
what
the
bloody
do
you
mean
by
standin
there
and
watchin
me
you
bloody
swine
it
took
me
all
my
time
to
keep
it
in
i
can
tell
you
meanwhile
rushton
was
still
going
about
the
house
occasionally
standing
and
watching
the
other
men
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
watched
philpot
and
harlow
none
of
the
men
looked
round
from
their
work
or
spoke
either
to
rushton
or
to
each
other
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
noises
made
by
the
saws
and
hammers
of
the
carpenters
who
were
fixing
the
frieze
rails
and
dado
rails
or
repairing
parts
of
the
woodwork
in
some
of
the
rooms
crass
placed
himself
in
rushton
way
several
times
with
the
hope
of
being
spoken
to
but
beyond
curtly
acknowledging
the
servile
hafternoon
sir
the
master
took
no
notice
of
him
after
about
an
hour
spent
in
this
manner
rushton
went
away
but
as
no
one
saw
him
go
it
was
not
until
some
considerable
time
after
his
departure
that
they
knew
that
he
was
gone
owen
was
secretly
very
disappointed
thought
he
had
come
to
tell
me
about
the
he
said
to
himself
i
suppose
it
not
decided
yet
just
as
the
were
beginning
to
breathe
freely
again
misery
arrived
carrying
some
papers
in
his
hand
he
also
flitted
silently
from
one
room
to
another
peering
round
corners
and
listening
at
doors
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
which
would
give
him
an
excuse
for
making
an
example
of
someone
disappointed
in
this
he
presently
crawled
upstairs
to
the
room
where
owen
was
working
and
handing
to
him
the
roll
of
papers
he
had
been
carrying
said
sweater
had
decided
to
this
work
done
so
you
can
start
on
it
as
soon
as
you
like
it
is
impossible
to
describe
without
appearing
to
exaggerate
the
emotions
experienced
by
owen
as
he
heard
this
announcement
for
one
thing
it
meant
that
the
work
at
this
house
would
last
longer
than
it
would
otherwise
have
done
and
it
also
meant
that
he
would
be
paid
for
the
extra
time
he
had
spent
on
the
drawings
besides
having
his
wages
increased
for
he
was
always
paid
an
extra
penny
an
hour
when
engaged
on
special
work
such
as
graining
or
or
work
of
the
present
kind
but
these
considerations
did
not
occur
to
him
at
the
moment
at
all
for
to
him
it
meant
much
more
since
his
first
conversation
on
the
subject
with
rushton
he
had
though
of
little
else
than
this
work
in
a
sense
he
had
been
doing
it
ever
since
he
had
thought
and
planned
and
altered
the
details
of
the
work
repeatedly
the
colours
for
the
different
parts
had
been
selected
and
rejected
and
over
and
over
again
a
keen
desire
to
do
the
work
had
grown
within
him
but
he
had
scarcely
allowed
himself
to
hope
that
it
would
be
done
at
all
his
face
flushed
slightly
as
he
took
the
drawings
from
hunter
can
make
a
start
on
it
tomorrow
morning
continued
that
gentleman
tell
crass
to
send
someone
else

drorins
ejaculated
misery
with
a
puzzled
expression
workin
drorins
you
got
them
ai
yer
pointing
to
the
roll
of
papers
but
as
the
same
ornaments
are
repeated
several
times
i
shall
have
to
make
a
number
of
drawings
with
perforated
outlines
to
transfer
the
design
to
the
walls
said
owen
and
he
proceeded
to
laboriously
explain
the
processes
nimrod
looked
at
him
suspiciously
all
that
really
necessary
he
asked
you
just
copy
it
on
the
wall
that
would
do
it
would
take
much
longer
that
way
this
consideration
appealed
to
misery
well
he
sighed
you
to
do
it
the
way
you
said
but
for
goodness
sake
do
spend
too
much
time
over
it
because
we
took
it
very
cheap
we
only
took
it
on
so
as
you
could
a
job
not
that
we
expect
to
make
any
profit
out
of
it
i
shall
have
to
cut
some
stencils
so
i
shall
need
several
sheets
of
cartridge
paper
upon
hearing
of
this
addition
expense
misery
long
visage
appeared
to
become
several
inches
longer
but
after
a
moment
thought
he
brightened
up
tell
you
what
he
exclaimed
with
a
cunning
leer
lots
of
odd
rolls
of
wallpaper
down
at
the
shop
could
you
manage
with
some
of
that
afraid
it
would
do
replied
owen
doubtfully
i
have
a
look
at
it
and
if
possible
i
use
it
do
said
misery
pleased
at
the
thought
of
saving
something
at
the
shop
on
your
way
home
tonight
and
we
see
what
we
can
find
long
do
you
think
it
take
you
to
make
the
drorins
and
the
stencils
today
thursday
if
you
let
someone
else
help
easton
to
get
the
room
ready
i
think
i
can
get
them
done
in
time
to
bring
them
with
me
on
monday
morning
do
yer
mean
bring
them
with
you
demanded
nimrod
shall
have
to
do
them
at
home
you
know
at
why
ca
you
do
there
no
table
for
one
thing
but
we
can
soon
fit
you
out
with
a
table
you
can
a
pair
of
paperhanger
tressels
and
boards
for
that
matter
have
a
lot
of
sketches
and
things
at
home
that
i
could
very
well
bring
here
said
owen
misery
argued
about
it
for
a
long
time
insisting
that
the
drawings
should
be
made
either
on
the
or
at
the
down
at
the
yard
how
he
asked
was
he
to
know
at
what
hour
owen
commenced
or
left
off
working
if
the
latter
did
them
at
home
sha
charge
any
more
time
than
i
really
work
replied
owen
ca
possibly
do
them
here
or
at
the
i
know
i
should
only
make
a
mess
of
them
under
such
conditions
i
you
to
your
own
way
said
misery
dolefully
let
harlow
help
easton
paint
the
room
out
so
as
you
can
get
your
stencils
and
things
ready
but
for
gord
sake
get
done
as
quick
as
you
can
if
you
could
manage
to
get
done
by
friday
and
come
down
and
help
easton
on
saturday
it
would
be
so
much
the
better
and
when
you
do
get
a
start
on
the
decoratin
i
take
too
much
care
over
it
you
know
if
i
was
you
because
we
to
take
the
job
for
next
to
nothing
or
mr
sweater
would
never
it
done
at
all
nimrod
now
began
to
crawl
about
the
house
snarling
and
grumbling
at
everyone
then
you
chaps
rouse
yourselves
he
bellowed
seem
to
think
this
is
a
if
some
of
you
do
make
a
better
show
than
this
i
to
a
alteration
there
plenty
of
chaps
walkin
about
doin
nothin
who
be
only
too
glad
of
a
job
he
went
into
the
scullery
where
crass
was
mixing
some
colour
crass
he
said
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
way
you
gettin
on
with
the
work
you
must
push
the
chaps
a
bit
more
than
you
doin
there
not
enough
being
done
by
a
long
way
we
shall
lose
money
over
this
job
before
we
finished
crass
whose
fat
face
had
turned
a
ghastly
green
with
fright
mumbled
something
about
getting
on
with
it
as
fast
as
he
could
you
to
make
move
a
bit
quicker
than
this
misery
howled
there
to
be
a
alteration
by
an
crass
understood
that
he
might
get
the
sack
or
that
someone
else
might
be
put
in
charge
of
the
job
and
that
would
of
course
reduce
him
to
the
ranks
and
do
away
with
his
chance
of
being
kept
on
longer
than
the
others
he
determined
to
try
to
ingratiate
himself
with
hunter
and
appease
his
wrath
by
sacrificing
someone
else
he
glanced
cautiously
into
the
kitchen
and
up
the
passage
and
then
lowering
his
voice
he
said
all
shapes
pretty
well
except
newman
i
would
told
you
about
before
but
i
thought
i
give
a
fair
chance
i
spoke
to
several
times
myself
about
not
doin
enough
but
it
do
seem
to
make
no
difference
me
eye
on
meself
for
some
time
replied
nimrod
in
the
same
tone
would
think
the
work
was
goin
to
be
sent
to
a
exhibition
the
way
messes
about
with
it
rubbing
it
with
glasspaper
and
stopping
up
every
little
crack
i
ca
understand
where
gets
all
the
glasspaper
from
brings
it
said
crass
hoarsely
know
for
a
fact
that
bought
two
sheets
of
it
last
week
out
of
own
money
did
did
snarled
misery
give
glasspaper
a
alteration
he
went
into
the
hall
where
he
remained
alone
for
a
considerable
time
brooding
at
last
with
the
manner
of
one
who
has
resolved
on
a
certain
course
of
action
he
turned
and
entered
the
room
where
philpot
and
harlow
were
working
both
get
sevenpence
an
hour
do
you
he
said
they
both
replied
to
the
affirmative
never
worked
under
price
yet
added
harlow
me
neither
observed
philpot
of
course
you
can
please
yourselves
hunter
continued
after
this
week
we
decided
not
to
pay
more
than
six
and
a
half
things
is
cut
so
fine
nowadays
that
we
ca
afford
to
go
on
sevenpence
any
longer
you
can
work
up
till
tomorrow
night
on
the
old
terms
but
if
you
not
willin
to
accept
six
and
a
half
you
come
on
saturday
morning
please
yourselves
take
it
or
leave
it
harlow
and
philpot
were
both
too
much
astonished
to
say
anything
in
reply
to
this
cheerful
announcement
and
hunter
with
the
final
remark
can
think
it
over
left
them
and
went
to
deliver
the
same
ultimatum
to
all
the
other
men
who
took
it
in
the
same
way
as
philpot
and
harlow
had
done
crass
and
owen
were
the
only
two
whose
wages
were
not
reduced
it
will
be
remembered
that
newman
was
one
of
those
who
were
already
working
for
the
reduced
rate
misery
found
him
alone
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
to
which
he
was
giving
the
final
coat
he
was
at
his
old
tricks
the
woodwork
of
the
cupboard
be
was
doing
was
in
a
rather
damaged
condition
and
he
was
facing
up
the
dents
with
putty
before
painting
it
he
knew
quite
well
that
hunter
objected
to
any
but
very
large
holes
or
cracks
being
stopped
and
yet
somehow
or
other
he
could
not
scamp
the
work
to
the
extent
that
he
was
ordered
to
and
so
almost
by
stealth
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
not
properly
but
as
well
as
he
dared
he
even
went
to
the
length
of
occasionally
buying
a
few
sheets
of
glasspaper
with
his
own
money
as
crass
had
told
hunter
when
the
latter
came
into
the
room
he
stood
with
a
sneer
on
his
face
watching
newman
for
about
five
minutes
before
he
spoke
the
workman
became
very
nervous
and
awkward
under
this
scrutiny
can
make
out
yer
and
come
to
the
office
for
yer
money
at
five
said
nimrod
at
last
sha
require
your
valuable
services
no
more
after
tonight
newman
went
white
what
wrong
said
he
have
i
done
it
not
wot
you
done
replied
misery
wot
you
not
done
that
wot
wrong
you
not
done
enough
that
all
and
without
further
parley
he
turned
and
went
out
newman
stood
in
the
darkening
room
feeling
as
if
his
heart
had
turned
to
lead
there
rose
before
his
mind
the
picture
of
his
home
and
family
he
could
see
them
as
they
were
at
this
very
moment
the
wife
probably
just
beginning
to
prepare
the
evening
meal
and
the
children
setting
the
cups
and
saucers
and
other
things
on
the
kitchen
table
a
noisy
work
enlivened
with
many
a
frolic
and
childish
dispute
even
the
baby
insisted
on
helping
although
she
always
put
everything
in
the
wrong
place
and
made
all
sorts
of
funny
mistakes
they
had
all
been
so
happy
lately
because
they
knew
that
he
had
work
that
would
last
till
nearly
christmas
if
not
longer
and
now
this
had
happened
to
plunge
them
back
into
the
abyss
of
wretchedness
from
which
they
had
so
recently
escaped
they
still
owed
several
weeks
rent
and
were
already
so
much
in
debt
to
the
baker
and
the
grocer
that
it
was
hopeless
to
expect
any
further
credit
god
said
newman
realizing
the
almost
utter
hopelessness
of
the
chance
of
obtaining
another
and
unconsciously
speaking
aloud
god
how
can
i
tell
them
what
will
become
of
us
having
accomplished
the
objects
of
his
visit
hunter
shortly
afterwards
departed
possibly
congratulating
himself
that
he
had
not
been
hiding
his
light
under
a
bushel
but
that
he
had
set
it
upon
a
candlestick
and
given
light
unto
all
that
were
within
that
house
as
soon
as
they
knew
that
he
was
gone
the
men
began
to
gather
into
little
groups
but
in
a
little
while
they
nearly
all
found
themselves
in
the
kitchen
discussing
the
reduction
sawkins
and
the
other
remained
at
their
work
some
of
them
got
only
fourpence
halfpenny
sawkins
was
paid
fivepence
so
none
of
these
were
affected
by
the
change
the
other
two
fresh
hands
the
journeymen
joined
the
crowd
in
the
kitchen
being
anxious
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
had
agreed
to
accept
the
reduced
rate
before
being
on
owen
also
was
there
having
heard
the
news
from
philpot
there
was
a
lot
of
furious
talk
at
first
several
of
them
spoke
of
up
at
once
but
others
were
more
prudent
for
they
knew
that
if
they
did
leave
there
were
dozens
of
others
who
would
be
eager
to
take
their
places
all
you
know
said
slyme
who
had
stowed
away
somewhere
at
the
back
of
his
head
an
idea
of
presently
starting
business
on
his
own
account
he
was
only
waiting
until
he
had
saved
enough
money
all
there
something
in
what
says
it
very
to
get
a
fair
price
for
work
nowadays
things
is
cut
very
fine
we
know
all
about
that
shouted
harlow
who
the
bloody
is
it
cuts
why
sich
b
rs
as
and
rushton
if
this
firm
cut
this
job
so
fine
some
other
firm
would
it
for
more
money
rushton
cuttin
it
fine
did
make
this
job
did
it
it
would
been
done
just
the
same
if
they
tendered
for
it
at
all
the
only
difference
is
that
we
should
been
workin
for
some
other
master
do
believe
the
bloody
job
cut
fine
at
all
said
philpot
is
a
pal
of
sweater
and
they
both
members
of
the
town
council
may
be
replied
slyme
all
the
same
i
believe
sweater
got
several
other
prices
besides
rushton
friend
or
no
friend
and
you
ca
blame
it
only
business
but
rushton
got
the
preference
sweater
may
told
the
others
prices
and
a
bloody
fine
lot
of
prices
they
was
too
if
the
truth
was
known
said
bundy
was
six
other
firms
after
this
job
to
my
knowledge
pushem
and
sloggem
bluffum
and
doemdown
dodger
and
scampit
snatcham
and
graball
smeeriton
and
leavit
makehaste
and
sloggitt
and
gord
only
knows
many
more
at
this
moment
newman
came
into
the
room
he
looked
so
white
and
upset
that
the
others
involuntarily
paused
in
their
conversation
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
harlow
of
what
said
newman
did
tell
you
cried
several
voices
whose
owners
looked
suspiciously
at
him
they
thought
if
hunter
had
not
spoken
to
newman
it
must
be
because
he
was
already
working
under
price
there
had
been
a
rumour
going
about
the
last
few
days
to
that
effect
misery
tell
you
they
not
goin
to
pay
more
than
six
and
a
half
after
this
week
not
what
said
to
me
just
told
me
to
knock
off
said
i
did
do
enough
for
christ
exclaimed
crass
pretending
to
be
overcome
with
surprise
newman
account
of
what
had
transpired
was
listened
to
in
gloomy
silence
who
a
few
minutes
previously
had
been
talking
loudly
of
chucking
up
the
job
became
filled
with
apprehension
that
they
might
be
served
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
been
crass
was
one
of
the
loudest
in
his
expression
of
astonishment
and
indignation
but
he
rather
overdid
it
and
only
succeeded
in
confirming
the
secret
suspicion
of
the
others
that
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
hunter
action
the
result
of
the
discussion
was
that
they
decided
to
submit
to
misery
terms
for
the
time
being
until
they
could
see
a
chance
of
getting
work
elsewhere
as
owen
had
to
go
to
the
office
to
see
the
wallpaper
spoken
of
by
hunter
he
accompanied
newman
when
the
latter
went
to
get
his
wages
nimrod
was
waiting
for
them
and
had
the
money
ready
in
an
envelope
which
he
handed
to
newman
who
took
it
without
speaking
and
went
away
misery
had
been
rummaging
amongst
the
old
wallpapers
and
had
got
out
a
great
heap
of
odd
rolls
which
he
now
submitted
to
owen
but
after
examining
them
the
latter
said
that
they
were
unsuitable
for
the
purpose
so
after
some
argument
misery
was
compelled
to
sign
an
order
for
some
proper
cartridge
paper
which
owen
obtained
at
a
on
his
way
home
the
next
morning
when
misery
went
to
the
he
was
in
a
fearful
rage
and
he
kicked
up
a
terrible
row
with
crass
he
said
that
mr
rushton
had
been
complaining
of
the
lack
of
discipline
on
the
job
and
he
told
crass
to
tell
all
the
hands
that
for
the
future
singing
in
working
hours
was
strictly
forbidden
and
anyone
caught
breaking
this
rule
would
be
instantly
dismissed
several
times
during
the
following
days
nimrod
called
at
owen
flat
to
see
how
the
work
was
progressing
and
to
impress
upon
him
the
necessity
of
not
taking
too
much
trouble
over
it
chapter
the
rev
john
starr
time
is
it
now
mum
asked
frankie
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
dinner
on
the
following
sunday
only
one
more
hour
and
charley
will
be
here
oh
i
wish
it
was
three
now
do
you
mother
dear
i
do
you
not
dressed
yet
you
know
frankie
made
a
grimace
surely
not
going
to
make
me
wear
my
velvets
are
you
mum
ca
i
go
just
as
i
am
in
my
old
clothes
the
was
a
brown
suit
of
that
material
that
nora
had
made
out
of
the
least
worn
parts
of
an
old
costume
of
her
own
course
not
if
you
went
as
you
are
now
you
have
everyone
staring
at
you
i
suppose
i
have
to
put
up
with
it
said
frankie
resignedly
i
think
you
better
begin
to
dress
me
now
do
you
there
plenty
of
time
yet
you
only
make
yourself
untidy
and
then
i
should
have
the
trouble
all
over
again
play
with
your
toys
a
little
while
and
when
i
done
the
washing
up
i
get
you
ready
frankie
obeyed
and
for
about
ten
minutes
his
mother
heard
him
in
the
next
room
rummaging
in
the
box
where
he
stored
his
collection
of
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
it
time
to
dress
me
yet
mum
dear
not
yet
you
need
be
afraid
you
be
ready
in
plenty
of
time
i
ca
help
being
afraid
you
might
forget
i
sha
forget
there
lots
of
time
you
know
i
should
be
much
easier
in
my
mind
if
you
would
dress
me
now
because
perhaps
our
clock
wrong
or
when
you
begin
dressing
me
you
find
some
buttons
off
or
something
and
then
there
be
a
lot
of
time
wasted
sewing
them
on
or
you
be
able
to
find
my
clean
stockings
or
something
and
then
while
looking
for
it
charley
might
come
and
if
he
sees
i
not
ready
he
might
wait
for
me
dear
said
nora
pretending
to
be
alarmed
at
this
appalling
list
of
possibilities
suppose
it
will
be
safer
to
dress
you
at
once
it
very
evident
you
wo
let
me
have
much
peace
until
it
is
done
but
mind
when
you
dressed
you
have
to
sit
down
quietly
and
wait
till
he
comes
because
i
do
want
the
trouble
of
dressing
you
twice
i
do
mind
sitting
still
returned
frankie
loftily
very
easy
do
mind
having
to
take
care
of
my
clothes
said
frankie
as
his
mother
having
washed
and
dressed
him
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
hair
brushing
and
combing
and
curling
the
long
yellow
locks
into
ringlets
round
her
fingers
only
thing
i
do
like
is
having
my
hair
done
you
know
all
these
curls
are
quite
unnecessary
i
sure
it
would
save
you
a
lot
of
trouble
if
you
would
mind
cutting
them
off
nora
did
not
answer
somehow
or
other
she
was
unwilling
to
comply
with
this
entreaty
it
seemed
to
her
that
when
this
hair
was
cut
off
the
child
would
have
become
a
different
individual
more
separate
and
independent
you
do
want
to
cut
it
off
for
your
own
sake
you
might
do
it
for
my
sake
because
i
think
it
the
reason
some
of
the
big
boys
want
to
play
with
me
and
some
of
them
shout
after
me
and
say
i
a
girl
and
sometimes
they
sneak
up
behind
me
and
pull
it
only
yesterday
i
had
to
have
a
fight
with
a
boy
for
doing
it
and
even
charley
linden
laughs
at
me
and
he
my
best
friend
except
you
and
dad
of
course
do
you
cut
it
off
mum
am
going
to
cut
it
as
i
promised
you
after
your
next
birthday
i
shall
be
jolly
glad
when
it
comes
wo
you
why
what
the
matter
mum
what
are
you
crying
for
frankie
was
so
concerned
that
he
began
to
cry
also
wondering
if
he
had
done
or
said
something
wrong
he
kissed
her
repeatedly
stroking
her
face
with
his
hand
what
the
matter
mother
was
thinking
that
when
you
over
seven
and
you
had
your
hair
cut
short
you
wo
be
a
baby
any
more
i
not
a
baby
now
am
i
here
look
at
this
he
strode
over
to
the
wall
and
dragging
out
two
chairs
he
placed
them
in
the
middle
of
the
room
back
to
back
about
fifteen
inches
apart
and
before
his
mother
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
had
climbed
up
and
stood
with
one
leg
on
the
back
of
each
chair
should
like
to
see
a
baby
who
could
do
this
he
cried
with
his
face
wet
with
tears
need
lift
me
down
i
can
get
down
by
myself
babies
ca
do
tricks
like
these
or
even
wipe
up
the
spoons
and
forks
or
sweep
the
passage
but
you
need
cut
it
off
if
you
do
want
to
i
bear
it
as
long
as
you
like
only
do
cry
any
more
because
it
makes
me
miserable
if
i
cry
when
i
fall
down
or
when
you
pull
my
hair
when
you
combing
it
you
always
tell
me
to
bear
it
like
a
man
and
not
be
a
baby
and
now
you
crying
yourself
just
because
i
not
a
baby
you
ought
to
be
jolly
glad
that
i
nearly
grown
up
into
a
man
because
you
know
i
promised
to
build
you
a
house
with
the
money
i
earn
and
then
you
need
do
no
more
work
we
have
a
servant
the
same
as
the
people
downstairs
and
dad
can
stop
at
home
and
sit
by
the
fire
and
read
the
paper
or
play
with
me
and
maud
and
have
pillow
fights
and
tell
stories
and
all
right
dearie
said
nora
kissing
him
not
crying
now
and
you
must
either
or
your
eyes
will
be
all
red
and
you
wo
be
able
to
go
with
charley
at
all
when
she
had
finished
dressing
him
frankie
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
apparently
lost
in
thought
at
last
he
said
do
you
get
a
baby
mother
you
could
nurse
it
and
i
could
have
it
to
play
with
instead
of
going
out
in
the
street
ca
afford
to
keep
a
baby
dear
you
know
even
as
it
is
sometimes
we
have
to
go
without
things
we
want
because
we
have
the
money
to
buy
them
babies
need
many
things
that
cost
lots
of
money
i
build
our
house
when
i
a
man
i
take
jolly
good
care
not
to
have
a
in
it
that
what
runs
away
with
all
the
money
we
always
putting
pennies
in
the
slot
and
that
reminds
me
charley
said
i
have
to
take
a
to
put
in
the
mishnery
box
oh
dear
i
tired
of
sitting
still
i
wish
he
come
what
time
is
it
now
mother
before
she
could
answer
both
frankie
anxiety
and
the
painful
ordeal
of
sitting
still
were
terminated
by
the
loud
peal
at
the
bell
announcing
charley
arrival
and
frankie
without
troubling
to
observe
the
usual
formality
of
looking
out
of
the
window
to
see
if
it
was
a
runaway
ring
had
clattered
downstairs
before
he
heard
his
mother
calling
him
to
come
back
for
the
halfpenny
then
he
clattered
up
again
and
then
down
again
at
such
a
rate
and
with
so
much
noise
as
to
rouse
the
indignation
of
all
the
respectable
people
in
the
house
when
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
remembered
that
he
had
omitted
to
say
goodbye
and
as
it
was
too
far
to
go
up
again
he
rang
the
bell
and
then
went
into
the
middle
of
the
road
and
looked
up
at
the
window
that
nora
opened
mother
he
shouted
dad
i
forgot
to
say
it
before
i
came
down
the
school
was
not
conducted
in
the
chapel
itself
but
in
a
large
lecture
hall
under
it
at
one
end
was
a
small
platform
raised
about
six
inches
from
the
floor
on
this
was
a
chair
and
a
small
table
a
number
of
groups
of
chairs
and
benches
were
arranged
at
intervals
round
the
sides
and
in
the
centre
of
the
room
each
group
of
seats
accommodating
a
separate
class
on
the
walls
which
were
painted
a
pale
green
were
a
number
of
coloured
pictures
moses
striking
the
rock
the
israelites
dancing
round
the
golden
calf
and
so
on
as
the
reader
is
aware
frankie
had
never
been
to
a
sunday
school
of
any
kind
before
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
in
at
the
door
and
half
afraid
to
enter
the
lessons
had
already
commenced
but
the
scholars
had
not
yet
settled
down
to
work
the
scene
was
one
of
some
disorder
some
of
the
children
talking
laughing
or
playing
and
the
teachers
alternately
threatening
and
coaxing
them
the
girls
and
the
very
young
children
classes
were
presided
over
by
ladies
the
boys
teachers
were
men
the
reader
already
has
some
slight
knowledge
of
a
few
of
these
people
there
was
mr
didlum
mr
sweater
mr
rushton
and
mr
hunter
and
mrs
starvem
ruth
easton
former
mistress
on
this
occasion
in
addition
to
the
teachers
and
other
officials
of
the
sunday
school
there
were
also
present
a
considerable
number
of
prettily
dressed
ladies
and
a
few
gentlemen
who
had
come
in
the
hope
of
meeting
the
rev
john
starr
the
young
clergyman
who
was
going
to
be
their
minister
for
the
next
few
weeks
during
the
absence
of
their
regular
shepherd
mr
belcher
who
was
going
away
for
a
holiday
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
mr
belcher
was
not
suffering
from
any
particular
malady
but
was
merely
down
and
rumour
had
it
that
this
condition
had
been
brought
about
by
the
rigorous
asceticism
of
his
life
and
his
intense
devotion
to
the
arduous
labours
of
his
holy
calling
mr
starr
had
conducted
the
service
in
the
shining
light
chapel
that
morning
and
a
great
sensation
had
been
produced
by
the
young
minister
earnest
and
eloquent
address
which
was
of
a
very
different
style
from
that
of
their
regular
minister
although
perhaps
they
had
not
quite
grasped
the
real
significance
of
all
that
he
had
said
most
of
them
had
been
favourably
impressed
by
the
young
appearance
and
manner
in
the
morning
but
that
might
have
arisen
from
prepossession
and
force
of
habit
for
they
were
accustomed
as
a
matter
of
course
to
think
well
of
any
minister
there
were
however
one
or
two
members
of
the
congregation
who
were
not
without
some
misgivings
and
doubts
as
to
the
soundness
of
his
doctrines
mr
starr
had
promised
that
he
would
look
in
some
time
during
the
afternoon
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
sunday
school
children
and
consequently
on
this
particular
afternoon
all
the
were
looking
forward
so
eagerly
to
hearing
him
again
that
not
much
was
done
in
the
way
of
lessons
every
time
a
late
arrival
entered
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
the
door
in
the
hope
and
expectation
that
it
was
he
when
frankie
standing
at
the
door
saw
all
the
people
looking
at
him
he
drew
back
timidly
on
man
said
charley
need
be
afraid
it
not
like
a
weekday
school
they
ca
do
nothing
to
us
not
even
if
we
behave
ourselves
there
our
class
over
in
that
corner
and
that
our
teacher
mr
hunter
you
can
sit
next
to
me
come
on
thus
encouraged
frankie
followed
charley
over
to
the
class
and
both
sat
down
the
teacher
was
so
kind
and
spoke
so
gently
to
the
children
that
in
a
few
minutes
frankie
felt
quite
at
home
when
hunter
noticed
how
well
cared
for
and
well
dressed
he
was
he
thought
the
child
must
belong
to
respectable
parents
frankie
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
lesson
for
he
was
too
much
interested
in
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
in
looking
at
the
other
children
he
also
noticed
a
very
fat
man
who
was
not
teaching
at
all
but
drifted
aimlessly
about
he
room
from
one
class
to
another
after
a
time
he
came
and
stood
by
the
class
where
frankie
was
and
after
nodding
to
hunter
remained
near
listening
and
smiling
patronizingly
at
the
children
he
was
arrayed
in
a
long
garment
of
costly
black
cloth
a
sort
of
frock
coat
and
by
the
rotundity
of
his
figure
he
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
accustomed
to
sit
in
the
chief
places
at
feasts
this
was
the
rev
mr
belcher
minister
of
the
shining
light
chapel
his
short
thick
neck
was
surrounded
by
a
studless
collar
and
apparently
buttonless
being
fastened
in
some
mysterious
way
known
only
to
himself
and
he
showed
no
shirt
front
the
long
garment
beforementioned
was
unbuttoned
and
through
the
opening
there
protruded
a
vast
expanse
of
waistcoat
and
trousers
distended
almost
to
bursting
by
the
huge
globe
of
flesh
they
contained
a
gold
with
a
locket
extended
partly
across
the
visible
portion
of
the
envelope
of
the
globe
he
had
very
large
feet
which
were
carefully
encased
in
soft
calfskin
boots
if
he
had
removed
the
long
garment
this
individual
would
have
resembled
a
balloon
the
feet
representing
the
car
and
the
small
head
that
surmounted
the
globe
the
safety
valve
as
it
was
it
did
actually
serve
the
purpose
of
a
safety
valve
the
owner
being
in
consequence
of
gross
overfeeding
and
lack
of
natural
exercise
afflicted
with
chronic
flatulence
which
manifested
itself
in
frequent
belchings
forth
through
the
mouth
of
the
foul
gases
generated
in
the
stomach
by
the
decomposition
of
the
foods
with
which
it
was
generally
loaded
but
as
the
rev
mr
belcher
had
never
been
seen
with
his
coat
off
no
one
ever
noticed
the
resemblance
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
take
his
coat
off
his
part
in
life
was
not
to
help
to
produce
but
to
help
to
devour
the
produce
of
the
labour
of
others
after
exchanging
a
few
words
and
grins
with
hunter
he
moved
on
to
another
class
and
presently
frankie
with
a
feeling
of
awe
noticed
that
the
confused
murmuring
sound
that
had
hitherto
pervaded
the
place
was
hushed
the
time
allotted
for
lessons
had
expired
and
the
teachers
were
quietly
distributing
to
the
children
meanwhile
the
balloon
had
drifted
up
to
the
end
of
the
hall
and
had
ascended
the
platform
where
it
remained
stationary
by
the
side
of
the
table
occasionally
emitting
puffs
of
gas
through
the
safety
valve
on
the
table
were
several
books
and
also
a
pile
of
folded
cards
these
latter
were
about
six
inches
by
three
inches
there
was
some
printing
on
the
outside
one
of
them
was
lying
open
on
the
table
showing
the
inside
which
was
ruled
and
had
money
columns
presently
mr
belcher
reached
out
a
flabby
white
hand
and
taking
up
one
of
the
folded
cards
he
looked
around
upon
the
children
with
a
large
sweet
benevolent
fatherly
smile
and
then
in
a
drawling
voice
occasionally
broken
by
explosions
of
flatulence
he
said
dear
children
this
afternoon
as
i
was
standing
near
brother
hunter
class
i
heard
him
telling
them
of
the
wanderings
of
the
children
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
and
of
all
the
wonderful
things
that
were
done
for
them
and
i
thought
how
sad
it
was
that
they
were
so
ungrateful
those
ungrateful
israelites
had
received
many
things
but
we
have
even
more
cause
to
be
grateful
than
they
had
for
we
have
received
even
more
abundantly
than
they
did
here
the
good
man
voice
was
stilled
by
a
succession
of
explosions
i
am
sure
he
resumed
none
of
you
would
like
to
be
even
as
those
israelites
ungrateful
for
all
the
good
things
you
have
received
oh
how
thankful
you
should
be
for
having
been
made
happy
english
children
now
i
am
sure
that
you
are
grateful
and
that
you
will
all
be
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
showing
your
gratitude
by
doing
something
in
return
some
of
you
have
noticed
the
unseemly
condition
of
the
interior
of
our
chapel
the
flooring
is
broken
in
countless
places
the
walls
are
sadly
in
need
of
cleansing
and
distempering
and
they
also
need
cementing
externally
to
keep
out
the
draught
the
seats
and
benches
and
the
chairs
are
also
in
a
most
unseemly
condition
and
need
varnishing
therefore
after
much
earnest
meditation
and
prayer
it
has
been
decided
to
open
a
subscription
list
and
although
times
are
very
hard
just
now
we
believe
we
shall
succeed
in
getting
enough
to
have
the
work
done
so
i
want
each
one
of
you
to
take
one
of
these
cards
and
go
round
to
all
your
friends
to
see
how
much
you
can
collect
it
matter
how
trifling
the
amounts
are
because
the
smallest
donations
will
be
thankfully
received
i
hope
you
will
all
do
your
very
best
ask
everyone
you
know
do
not
refrain
from
asking
people
because
you
think
that
they
are
too
poor
to
give
a
donation
but
remind
them
that
if
they
can
not
give
their
thousands
they
can
give
the
widow
mite
ask
everyone
first
of
all
ask
those
whom
you
feel
certain
will
give
then
ask
all
those
whom
you
think
may
possibly
give
and
finally
ask
all
those
whom
you
feel
certain
will
not
give
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
that
many
of
these
last
will
donate
abundantly
your
friends
are
very
poor
and
unable
to
give
a
large
donation
at
one
time
a
good
plan
would
be
to
arrange
to
call
upon
them
every
saturday
afternoon
with
your
card
to
collect
their
donations
and
while
you
are
asking
others
do
not
forget
to
give
what
you
can
yourselves
just
a
little
and
those
pennies
and
which
you
so
often
spend
on
sweets
and
other
unnecessary
things
might
be
given
as
a
donation
to
the
good
cause
here
the
holy
man
paused
again
and
there
was
a
rumbling
gurgling
noise
in
the
interior
of
the
balloon
followed
by
several
escapes
of
gas
through
the
safety
valve
the
paroxysm
over
the
apostle
of
continued
those
who
wish
to
collect
donations
will
stay
behind
for
a
few
minutes
after
school
when
brother
hunter
who
has
kindly
consented
to
act
as
secretary
to
the
fund
will
issue
the
cards
would
like
here
to
say
a
few
words
of
thanks
to
brother
hunter
for
the
great
interest
he
has
displayed
in
this
matter
and
for
all
the
trouble
he
is
taking
to
help
us
to
gather
in
the
donations
this
tribute
was
well
deserved
hunter
in
fact
had
originated
the
whole
scheme
in
the
hope
of
securing
the
job
for
rushton
and
per
cent
of
the
profits
for
himself
mr
belcher
now
replaced
the
collecting
card
on
the
table
and
taking
up
one
of
the
gave
out
the
words
and
afterwards
conducted
the
singing
flourishing
one
fat
flabby
white
hand
in
the
air
and
holding
the
book
in
the
other
as
the
last
strains
of
the
music
died
away
he
closed
his
eyes
and
a
sweet
smile
widened
his
mouth
as
he
stretched
forth
his
right
hand
open
palm
down
with
the
fingers
close
together
and
said
us
pray
with
much
shuffling
of
feet
everyone
knelt
down
hunter
lanky
form
was
distributed
over
a
very
large
area
his
body
lay
along
one
of
the
benches
his
legs
and
feet
sprawled
over
the
floor
and
his
huge
hands
clasped
the
sides
of
the
seat
his
eyes
were
tightly
closed
and
an
expression
of
the
most
intense
misery
pervaded
his
long
face
mrs
starvem
being
so
fat
that
she
knew
if
she
once
knelt
down
she
would
never
be
able
to
get
up
again
compromised
by
sitting
on
the
extreme
edge
of
her
chair
resting
her
elbows
on
the
back
of
the
seat
in
front
of
her
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
it
was
a
very
large
face
but
her
hands
were
capacious
enough
to
receive
it
in
a
seat
at
the
back
of
the
hall
knelt
a
little
woman
about
years
of
age
very
shabbily
dressed
who
had
come
in
during
the
singing
this
was
mrs
white
the
caretaker
bert
white
mother
when
her
husband
died
the
committee
of
the
chapel
out
of
charity
gave
her
this
work
for
which
they
paid
her
six
shillings
a
week
of
course
they
could
not
offer
her
full
employment
the
idea
was
that
she
could
get
other
work
as
well
charing
and
things
of
that
kind
and
do
the
chapel
work
in
between
there
was
much
to
do
just
the
heating
furnace
to
light
when
necessary
the
chapel
committee
rooms
classrooms
and
sunday
school
to
sweep
and
scrub
out
occasionally
the
to
collect
etc
whenever
they
had
a
tea
meeting
which
was
on
an
average
about
twice
a
week
there
were
the
trestle
tables
to
fix
up
the
chairs
to
arrange
the
table
to
set
out
and
then
supervised
by
miss
didlum
or
some
other
lady
the
tea
to
make
there
was
rather
a
lot
to
do
on
the
days
following
these
functions
the
washing
up
the
tables
and
chairs
to
put
away
the
floor
to
sweep
and
so
on
but
the
extra
work
was
supposed
to
be
compensated
by
the
cakes
and
broken
victuals
generally
left
over
from
the
feast
which
were
much
appreciated
as
a
welcome
change
from
the
bread
and
dripping
or
margarine
that
constituted
mrs
white
and
bert
usual
fare
there
were
several
advantages
attached
to
the
position
the
caretaker
became
acquainted
with
the
leading
members
and
their
wives
some
of
who
out
of
charity
occasionally
gave
her
a
day
work
as
charwoman
the
wages
being
on
about
the
same
generous
scale
as
those
she
earned
at
the
chapel
sometimes
supplemented
by
a
parcel
of
broken
victuals
or
some
castoff
clothing
an
worldly
or
unconverted
person
might
possibly
sum
up
the
matter
thus
these
people
required
this
work
done
they
employed
this
woman
to
do
it
taking
advantage
of
her
poverty
to
impose
upon
her
conditions
of
price
and
labour
that
they
would
not
have
liked
to
endure
themselves
although
she
worked
very
hard
early
and
late
the
money
they
paid
her
as
wages
was
insufficient
to
enable
her
to
provide
herself
with
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
then
her
employers
being
good
kind
generous
christian
people
came
to
the
rescue
and
bestowed
charity
in
the
form
of
clothing
and
broken
victuals
should
any
such
worldly
or
unconverted
persons
happen
to
read
these
lines
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
their
impious
and
malicious
criticisms
to
say
that
no
such
thoughts
ever
entered
the
simple
mind
of
mrs
white
herself
on
the
contrary
this
very
afternoon
as
she
knelt
in
the
chapel
wearing
an
old
mantle
that
some
years
previously
had
adorned
the
obese
person
of
the
saintly
mrs
starvem
her
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
towards
her
generous
benefactors
during
the
prayer
the
door
was
softly
opened
a
gentleman
in
clerical
dress
entered
on
tiptoe
and
knelt
down
next
to
mr
didlum
he
came
in
very
softly
but
all
the
same
most
of
those
present
heard
him
and
lifted
their
heads
or
peeped
through
their
fingers
to
see
who
it
was
and
when
they
recognized
him
a
sound
like
a
sigh
swept
through
the
hall
at
the
end
of
the
prayer
amid
groans
and
cries
of
the
balloon
slowly
descended
from
the
platform
and
collapsed
into
one
of
the
seats
and
everyone
rose
up
from
the
floor
when
all
were
seated
and
the
shuffling
coughing
and
blowing
of
noses
had
ceased
mr
didlum
stood
up
and
said
we
sing
the
closin
the
gentleman
hon
my
left
the
rev
mr
john
starr
will
say
a
few
words
an
expectant
murmur
rippled
through
the
hall
the
ladies
lifted
their
eyebrows
and
nodded
smiled
and
whispered
to
each
other
the
gentlemen
assumed
various
attitudes
and
expressions
the
children
were
very
quiet
everyone
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
as
john
starr
rose
from
his
seat
and
stepping
up
on
to
the
platform
stood
by
the
side
of
the
table
facing
them
he
was
about
years
of
age
tall
and
slenderly
built
his
intellectual
face
with
its
lofty
forehead
and
his
air
of
refinement
and
culture
were
in
striking
contrast
to
the
coarse
appearance
of
the
other
adults
in
the
room
the
vulgar
ignorant
uncultivated
crowd
of
and
hucksters
in
front
of
him
but
it
was
not
merely
his
air
of
good
breeding
and
the
general
comeliness
of
his
exterior
that
attracted
and
held
one
there
was
an
indefinable
something
about
him
an
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
love
that
seemed
to
radiate
from
his
whole
being
almost
compelling
confidence
and
affection
from
all
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
as
he
stood
there
facing
the
others
with
an
inexpressibly
winning
smile
upon
his
comely
face
it
seemed
impossible
that
there
could
be
any
fellowship
between
him
and
them
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
give
anyone
even
an
inkling
of
the
truth
which
was
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
bolstering
up
the
characters
of
the
despicable
crew
of
sweaters
and
who
paid
his
wages
he
did
not
give
a
very
long
address
this
afternoon
only
just
a
few
words
but
they
were
very
precious
original
and
illuminating
he
told
them
of
certain
thoughts
that
had
occurred
to
his
mind
on
his
way
there
that
afternoon
and
as
they
listened
sweater
rushton
didlum
hunter
and
the
other
disciples
exchanged
significant
looks
and
gestures
was
it
not
magnificent
such
power
such
reasoning
in
fact
as
they
afterwards
modestly
admitted
to
each
other
it
was
so
profound
that
even
they
experienced
great
difficulty
in
fathoming
the
meaning
as
for
the
ladies
they
were
motionless
and
dumb
with
admiration
they
sat
with
flushed
faces
shining
eyes
and
palpitating
hearts
looking
hungrily
at
the
dear
man
as
he
proceeded
our
time
this
afternoon
does
not
permit
us
to
dwell
at
length
upon
these
thoughts
perhaps
at
some
future
date
we
may
have
the
blessed
privilege
of
so
doing
but
this
afternoon
i
have
been
asked
to
say
a
few
words
on
another
subject
the
failing
health
of
your
dear
minister
has
for
some
time
past
engaged
the
anxious
attention
of
the
congregation
sympathetic
glances
were
directed
towards
the
interesting
invalid
the
ladies
murmured
dear
and
other
expressions
of
anxious
concern
naturally
robust
continued
starr
continued
overwork
the
loving
solicitude
for
others
that
often
prevented
him
taking
even
necessary
repose
and
a
too
rigorous
devotion
to
the
practice
of
have
at
last
brought
about
the
inevitable
breakdown
and
rendered
a
period
of
rest
absolutely
imperative
the
orator
paused
to
take
breath
and
the
silence
that
ensued
was
disturbed
only
by
faint
rumblings
in
the
interior
of
the
ascetic
victim
of
overwork
this
laudable
object
proceeded
starr
subscription
list
was
quietly
opened
about
a
month
ago
and
those
dear
children
who
had
cards
and
assisted
in
the
good
work
of
collecting
donations
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
altogether
a
goodly
sum
was
gathered
but
as
it
was
not
quite
enough
the
committee
voted
a
further
amount
out
of
the
general
fund
and
at
a
special
meeting
held
last
friday
evening
your
dear
shepherd
was
presented
with
an
illuminated
address
and
a
purse
of
gold
sufficient
to
defray
the
expenses
of
a
month
holiday
in
the
south
of
france
of
course
he
regrets
being
separated
from
you
even
for
such
a
brief
period
he
feels
that
in
going
he
is
choosing
the
lesser
of
two
evils
it
is
better
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
for
a
month
than
to
continue
working
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
exhausted
nature
and
perhaps
be
taken
away
from
you
altogether
to
heaven
forbid
fervently
ejaculated
several
disciples
and
a
ghastly
pallor
overspread
the
features
of
the
object
of
their
prayers
as
it
is
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
let
us
hope
and
pray
for
the
best
but
if
the
worst
should
happen
and
he
is
called
upon
to
ascend
there
will
be
some
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
avert
the
dreadful
calamity
here
probably
as
a
precaution
against
the
possibility
of
an
involuntary
ascent
a
large
quantity
of
gas
was
permitted
to
escape
through
the
safety
valve
of
the
balloon
sets
out
on
his
pilgrimage
tomorrow
concluded
starr
i
am
sure
he
will
be
followed
by
the
good
wishes
and
prayers
of
all
the
members
of
his
flock
the
reverend
gentleman
resumed
his
seat
and
almost
immediately
it
became
evident
from
the
oscillations
of
the
balloon
that
mr
belcher
was
desirous
of
rising
to
say
a
few
words
in
acknowledgement
but
he
was
restrained
by
the
entreaties
of
those
near
him
who
besought
him
not
to
exhaust
himself
he
afterwards
said
that
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
say
much
even
if
they
had
permitted
him
to
speak
because
he
felt
too
full
the
absence
of
our
beloved
pastor
said
brother
didlum
who
now
rose
to
give
out
the
closing
hymn
flock
will
not
be
left
hentirely
without
a
shepherd
for
we
arranged
with
mr
starr
to
come
and
say
a
few
words
to
us
hevery
sunday
from
the
manner
in
which
they
constantly
referred
to
themselves
it
might
have
been
thought
that
they
were
a
flock
of
sheep
instead
of
being
what
they
really
were
a
pack
of
wolves
when
they
heard
brother
didlum
announcement
a
murmur
of
intense
rapture
rose
from
the
ladies
and
mr
starr
rolled
his
eyes
and
smiled
sweetly
brother
didlum
did
not
mention
the
details
of
the
to
have
done
so
at
that
time
would
have
been
most
unseemly
but
the
following
extract
from
the
accounts
of
the
chapel
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
rev
john
starr
for
sunday
per
the
treasurer
it
was
not
a
large
sum
considering
the
great
services
rendered
by
mr
starr
but
small
as
it
was
it
is
to
be
feared
that
many
worldly
unconverted
persons
will
think
it
was
far
too
much
to
pay
for
a
few
words
even
such
wise
words
as
mr
john
starr
admittedly
always
were
but
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
after
the
was
over
most
of
the
children
including
charley
and
frankie
remained
to
get
collecting
cards
mr
starr
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
admirers
and
a
little
later
when
he
rode
away
with
mr
belcher
and
mr
sweater
in
the
latter
motor
car
the
ladies
looked
hungrily
after
that
conveyance
listening
to
the
melancholy
of
its
hooter
and
trying
to
console
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
they
would
see
him
again
in
a
few
hours
time
at
the
evening
service
chapter
the
lodger
in
accordance
with
his
arrangement
with
hunter
owen
commenced
the
work
in
the
on
the
monday
morning
harlow
and
easton
were
distempering
some
of
the
ceilings
and
about
ten
they
went
down
to
the
scullery
to
get
some
more
whitewash
crass
was
there
as
usual
pretending
to
be
very
busy
mixing
colours
wot
do
you
think
of
it
he
said
as
he
served
them
with
what
they
required
of
what
asked
easton
hour
speshul
hartist
replied
crass
with
a
sneer
you
think
goin
to
get
through
with
it
like
to
say
replied
easton
guardedly
know
it
one
thing
to
draw
on
a
bit
of
paper
and
colour
it
with
a
penny
box
of
paints
and
quite
another
thing
to
do
it
on
a
wall
or
ceiling
continued
crass
it
that
true
enough
said
harlow
you
believe
they
own
designs
crass
went
on
rather
to
tell
remarked
easton
embarrassed
neither
harlow
nor
easton
shared
crass
sentiments
in
this
matter
but
at
the
same
time
they
could
not
afford
to
offend
him
by
sticking
up
for
owen
you
was
to
ast
me
quietly
crass
added
should
be
more
inclined
to
say
as
copied
it
all
out
of
some
book
just
about
the
size
of
it
mate
agreed
harlow
would
be
a
bit
of
all
right
if
was
to
make
a
bloody
mess
of
it
would
it
crass
continued
with
a
malignant
leer
arf
said
harlow
when
the
two
men
regained
the
upper
landing
on
which
they
were
working
they
exchanged
significant
glances
and
laughed
quietly
hearing
these
sounds
of
merriment
philpot
who
was
working
alone
in
a
room
close
by
put
his
head
out
of
the
doorway
the
game
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
crass
ai
arf
wild
about
owen
doin
that
room
replied
harlow
and
repeated
the
substance
of
crass
remarks
is
a
bit
of
a
for
the
bleeder

to
play
second

philpot
with
a
delighted
grin

same
things

but
i
ca

like
i
ai
got
no
for
it
agree
with
some
of
it
too
said
harlow
with
a
laugh
all
the
same
does
say
some
bloody
silly
things
you
must
admit
for
instance
that
stuff
about
money
bein
the
cause
of
poverty
i
ca
exactly
see
that
meself
agreed
philpot
must
tackle
about
that
at
said
harlow
should
rather
like
to
makes
it
out
gord
sake
do
go
startin
no
arguments
at
said
easton
alone
when
is
quiet
let
our
dinner
in
peace
if
possible
said
philpot
he
added
hoarsely
suddenly
holding
up
his
hand
warningly
they
listened
intently
it
was
evident
from
the
creaking
of
the
stairs
that
someone
was
crawling
up
them
philpot
instantly
disappeared
harlow
lifted
up
the
pail
of
whitewash
and
set
it
down
again
noisily
think
we
better
the
steps
and
the
plank
over
this
side
easton
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
i
think
that
be
the
best
way
replied
easton
while
they
were
arranging
their
scaffold
to
do
the
ceiling
crass
arrived
on
the
landing
he
made
no
remark
at
first
but
walked
into
the
room
to
see
how
many
ceilings
they
had
done
better
look
alive
you
chaps
he
said
as
he
went
downstairs
again
we
do
get
these
ceilings
finished
by
nimrod
sure
to
ramp
right
said
harlow
gruffly
bloody
soon
slosh
over
was
a
very
suitable
word
very
descriptive
of
the
manner
in
which
the
work
was
done
the
cornices
of
the
staircase
ceilings
were
enriched
with
plaster
ornaments
these
ceilings
were
supposed
to
have
been
washed
off
but
as
the
men
who
were
put
to
do
that
work
had
not
been
allowed
sufficient
time
to
do
it
properly
the
crevices
of
the
ornaments
were
still
filled
up
with
old
whitewash
and
by
the
time
harlow
and
easton
had
a
lot
more
whitewash
on
to
them
they
were
mere
formless
unsightly
lumps
of
plaster
the
who
did
the
off
were
not
to
blame
they
had
been
hunted
away
from
the
work
before
it
was
half
done
while
harlow
and
easton
were
distempering
these
ceilings
philpot
and
the
other
hands
were
proceeding
with
the
painting
in
different
parts
of
the
inside
of
the
house
and
owen
assisted
by
bert
was
getting
on
with
the
work
in
the
striking
chalk
lines
and
measuring
and
setting
out
the
different
panels
there
were
no
arguments
that
day
at
to
the
disappointment
of
crass
who
was
still
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
produce
the
obscurer
cutting
after
dinner
when
the
others
had
all
gone
back
to
their
work
philpot
unobtrusively
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
gathered
up
the
discarded
paper
wrappers
in
which
some
of
the
men
had
brought
their
food
spreading
one
of
these
open
he
shook
the
crumbs
from
the
others
upon
it
in
this
way
and
by
picking
up
particles
of
bread
from
the
floor
he
collected
a
little
pile
of
crumbs
and
crusts
to
these
he
added
some
fragments
that
he
had
left
from
his
own
dinner
he
then
took
the
parcel
upstairs
and
opening
one
of
the
windows
threw
the
crumbs
on
to
the
roof
of
the
portico
he
had
scarcely
closed
the
window
when
two
starlings
fluttered
down
and
began
to
eat
philpot
watching
them
furtively
from
behind
the
shutter
the
afternoon
passed
uneventfully
from
one
till
five
seemed
a
very
long
time
to
most
of
the
hands
but
to
owen
and
his
mate
who
were
doing
something
in
which
they
were
able
to
feel
some
interest
and
pleasure
the
time
passed
so
rapidly
that
they
both
regretted
the
approach
of
evening
days
remarked
bert
always
keeps
on
wishin
it
was
time
to
go
but
today
seems
to
gorn
like
lightnin
after
leaving
off
that
night
all
the
men
kept
together
till
they
arrived
down
town
and
then
separated
owen
went
by
himself
easton
philpot
crass
and
bundy
adjourned
to
the
arms
to
have
a
drink
together
before
going
home
and
slyme
who
was
a
teetotaler
went
by
himself
although
he
was
now
lodging
with
easton
wait
for
me
said
the
latter
as
he
went
off
with
crass
and
the
others
shall
most
likely
catch
you
up
before
you
get
there
right
replied
slyme
this
evening
slyme
did
not
take
the
direct
road
home
he
turned
into
the
main
street
and
pausing
before
the
window
of
a
toy
shop
examined
the
articles
displayed
therein
attentively
after
some
minutes
he
appeared
to
have
come
to
a
decision
and
entering
the
shop
he
purchased
a
baby
rattle
for
fourpence
halfpenny
it
was
a
pretty
toy
made
of
white
bone
and
coloured
wool
with
a
number
of
little
bells
hanging
upon
it
and
a
ring
of
white
bone
at
the
end
of
the
handle
when
he
came
out
of
the
shop
slyme
set
out
for
home
this
time
walking
rapidly
when
he
entered
the
house
ruth
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
she
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
disappointment
as
she
perceived
that
he
was
alone
will
got
to
again
she
asked
gone
to
a
drink
with
some
of
the
chaps
he
said
he
be
long
replied
slyme
as
he
put
his
food
basket
on
the
dresser
and
went
upstairs
to
his
room
to
wash
and
to
change
his
clothes
when
he
came
down
again
easton
had
not
yet
arrived
ready
except
just
to
make
the
tea
said
ruth
who
was
evidently
annoyed
at
the
continued
absence
of
easton
you
may
as
well
have
yours
now
in
no
hurry
i
wait
a
little
and
see
if
he
comes
he
sure
to
be
here
soon
you
sure
you
do
mind
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
wait
said
ruth
it
will
save
me
making
two
lots
of
tea
they
waited
for
about
half
an
hour
talking
at
intervals
in
a
constrained
awkward
way
about
trivial
subjects
then
as
easton
did
not
come
ruth
decided
to
serve
slyme
without
waiting
any
longer
with
this
intention
she
laid
the
baby
in
its
cot
but
the
child
resented
this
arrangement
and
began
to
cry
so
she
had
to
hold
him
under
her
left
arm
while
she
made
the
tea
seeing
her
in
this
predicament
slyme
exclaimed
holding
out
his
hands
let
me
hold
him
while
you
do
that
you
said
ruth
who
in
spite
of
her
instinctive
dislike
of
the
man
could
not
help
feeling
gratified
with
this
attention
mind
you
do
let
him
fall
but
the
instant
slyme
took
hold
of
the
child
it
began
to
cry
even
louder
than
it
did
when
it
was
put
into
the
cradle
always
like
that
with
strangers
apologized
ruth
as
she
took
him
back
again
a
minute
said
slyme
got
something
upstairs
in
my
pocket
that
will
keep
him
quiet
i
forgotten
all
about
it
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
presently
returned
with
the
rattle
when
the
baby
saw
the
bright
colours
and
heard
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
he
crowed
with
delight
and
reached
out
his
hands
eagerly
towards
it
and
allowed
slyme
to
take
him
without
a
murmur
of
protest
before
ruth
had
finished
making
and
serving
the
tea
the
man
and
child
were
on
the
very
best
of
terms
with
each
other
so
much
so
indeed
that
when
ruth
had
finished
and
went
to
take
him
again
the
baby
seemed
reluctant
to
part
from
slyme
who
had
been
dancing
him
in
the
air
and
tickling
him
in
the
most
delightful
way
ruth
too
began
to
have
a
better
opinion
of
slyme
and
felt
inclined
to
reproach
herself
for
having
taken
such
an
unreasonable
dislike
of
him
at
first
he
was
evidently
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
after
all
the
baby
had
by
this
time
discovered
the
use
of
the
bone
ring
at
the
end
of
the
handle
of
the
toy
and
was
biting
it
energetically
a
very
beautiful
rattle
said
ruth
you
very
much
for
it
it
just
the
very
thing
he
wanted
heard
you
say
the
other
day
that
he
wanted
something
of
the
kind
to
bite
on
to
help
his
teeth
through
answered
slyme
when
i
happened
to
notice
that
in
the
shop
i
remembered
what
you
said
and
thought
i
bring
it
home
the
baby
took
the
ring
out
of
its
mouth
and
shaking
the
rattle
frantically
in
the
air
laughed
and
crowed
merrily
looking
at
slyme
dad
dad
he
cried
holding
out
his
arms
slyme
and
ruth
burst
out
laughing
not
your
dad
you
silly
boy
she
said
kissing
the
child
as
she
spoke
dad
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
staying
out
like
this
we
give
him
dad
dad
dad
when
he
does
come
home
we
but
the
baby
only
shook
the
rattle
and
rang
the
bells
and
laughed
and
crowed
and
laughed
again
louder
than
ever
chapter
the
filling
of
the
tank
viewed
from
outside
the
arms
was
a
building
with
windows
and
a
profusion
of
gilding
the
pilasters
were
painted
in
imitation
of
different
marbles
and
the
doors
grained
to
represent
costly
woods
there
were
panels
containing
painted
advertisements
of
wines
and
spirits
and
beer
written
in
gold
and
ornamented
with
gaudy
colours
on
the
lintel
over
the
principal
entrance
was
inscribed
in
small
white
letters
harpy
licensed
to
sell
wines
spirits
and
malt
liquor
by
retail
to
be
consumed
either
on
or
off
the
premises
the
bar
was
arranged
in
the
usual
way
being
divided
into
several
compartments
first
there
was
the
bar
on
the
glass
of
the
door
leading
into
this
was
fixed
a
printed
bill
four
ale
served
in
this
bar
next
to
the
saloon
bar
was
the
jug
and
bottle
department
much
appreciated
by
ladies
who
wished
to
indulge
in
a
drop
of
gin
on
the
quiet
there
were
also
two
small
bars
only
capable
of
holding
two
or
three
persons
where
nothing
less
than
fourpennyworth
of
spirits
or
glasses
of
ale
at
threepence
were
served
finally
the
public
bar
the
largest
compartment
of
all
at
each
end
separating
it
from
the
other
departments
was
a
wooden
partition
painted
and
varnished
wooden
forms
fixed
across
the
partitions
and
against
the
walls
under
the
windows
provided
seating
accommodation
for
the
customers
a
large
automatic
musical
instrument
a
in
the
polyphone
resembling
a
grandfather
clock
in
shape
stood
against
one
of
the
partitions
and
close
up
to
the
counter
so
that
those
behind
the
bar
could
reach
to
wind
it
up
hanging
on
the
partition
near
the
polyphone
was
a
board
about
fifteen
inches
square
over
the
surface
of
which
were
distributed
a
number
of
small
hooks
numbered
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
was
a
net
made
of
fine
twine
extended
by
means
of
a
piece
of
wire
in
this
net
several
rings
about
three
inches
in
diameter
were
lying
there
was
no
table
in
the
place
but
jutting
out
from
the
other
partition
was
a
hinged
flap
about
three
feet
long
by
twenty
inches
wide
which
could
be
folded
down
when
not
in
use
this
was
the
board
the
coins
old
french
pennies
used
in
playing
this
game
were
kept
behind
the
bar
and
might
be
borrowed
on
application
on
the
partition
just
above
the
board
was
a
neatly
printed
notice
framed
and
glazed
notice
gentlemen
using
this
house
are
requested
to
refrain
from
using
obscene
language
alongside
this
notice
were
a
number
of
bills
advertising
the
local
theatre
and
the
and
another
of
a
travelling
circus
and
menagerie
then
visiting
the
town
and
encamped
on
a
piece
of
waste
ground
about
on
the
road
to
windley
the
fittings
behind
the
bar
and
the
counter
were
of
polished
mahogany
with
silvered
plate
glass
at
the
back
of
the
shelves
on
the
shelves
were
rows
of
bottles
and
decanters
gin
whisky
brandy
and
wines
and
liqueurs
of
different
kinds
when
crass
philpot
easton
and
bundy
entered
the
landlord
a
individual
in
white
and
a
bright
maroon
fancy
waistcoat
with
a
massive
gold
and
a
diamond
ring
was
conversing
in
an
affable
friendly
way
with
one
of
his
regular
customers
who
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
seat
close
to
the
counter
a
shabbily
dressed
degraded
trembling
wretch
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
every
day
and
all
his
money
in
this
bar
he
was
a
wreck
of
a
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
supposed
to
be
a
carpenter
although
he
never
worked
at
that
trade
now
it
was
commonly
said
that
some
years
previously
he
had
married
a
woman
considerably
his
senior
the
landlady
of
a
this
business
was
evidently
sufficiently
prosperous
to
enable
him
to
exist
without
working
and
to
maintain
himself
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
this
besotted
wretch
practically
lived
at
the
he
came
regularly
very
morning
and
sometimes
earned
a
pint
of
beer
by
assisting
the
barman
to
sweep
up
the
sawdust
or
clean
the
windows
he
usually
remained
in
the
bar
until
closing
time
every
night
he
was
a
very
good
customer
not
only
did
he
spend
whatever
money
he
could
get
hold
of
himself
but
he
was
the
cause
of
others
spending
money
for
he
was
acquainted
with
most
of
the
other
regular
customers
who
knowing
his
impecunious
condition
often
stood
him
a
drink
the
good
of
the
house
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
public
bar
previous
to
the
entrance
of
crass
and
his
mates
was
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
a
sitting
on
the
form
near
the
board
he
was
wearing
a
battered
bowler
hat
and
the
usual
shabby
clothes
this
individual
had
a
very
thin
pale
face
with
a
large
nose
and
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
portraits
of
the
first
duke
of
wellington
he
was
not
a
regular
customer
here
having
dropped
in
casually
about
two
and
had
remained
ever
since
he
was
beginning
to
show
the
effects
of
the
drink
he
had
taken
during
that
time
as
crass
and
the
others
came
in
they
were
hailed
with
enthusiasm
by
the
landlord
and
the
besotted
wretch
while
the
workman
regarded
them
with
fishy
eyes
and
stupid
curiosity
cheer
bob
said
the
landlord
affably
addressing
crass
and
nodding
familiarly
to
the
others
goes
it
reet
me
ole
dear
replied
crass
jovially
yerself
replied
the
dear
getting
up
from
his
chair
in
readiness
to
execute
their
orders
wot
it
to
be
inquired
philpot
of
the
others
generally
a
pint
o
beer
said
crass
for
me
said
bundy
o
beer
for
me
too
replied
easton
one
pint
two
and
a
pint
o
porter
for
meself
said
philpot
turning
and
addressing
the
old
dear
while
the
landlord
was
serving
these
drinks
the
besotted
wretch
finished
his
beer
and
set
the
empty
glass
down
on
the
counter
and
philpot
observing
this
said
to
him
one
along
o
me
do
mind
if
i
do
replied
the
other
when
the
drinks
were
served
philpot
instead
of
paying
for
them
winked
significantly
at
the
landlord
who
nodded
silently
and
unobtrusively
made
an
entry
in
an
account
book
that
was
lying
on
one
of
the
shelves
although
it
was
only
monday
and
he
had
been
at
work
all
the
previous
week
philpot
was
already
stony
broke
this
was
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
on
saturday
he
had
paid
his
landlady
something
on
account
of
the
arrears
of
board
and
lodging
money
that
had
accumulated
while
he
was
out
of
work
and
he
had
also
paid
the
old
dear
four
shillings
for
drinks
obtained
on
tick
during
the
last
week
the
skin
orf
yer
nose
said
crass
nodding
to
philpot
and
taking
a
long
pull
at
the
pint
glass
which
the
latter
had
handed
to
him
similar
appropriate
and
friendly
sentiments
were
expressed
by
the
others
and
suitably
acknowledged
by
philpot
the
founder
of
the
feast
the
old
dear
now
put
a
penny
in
the
slot
of
the
polyphone
and
winding
it
up
started
it
playing
it
was
some
unfamiliar
tune
but
when
the
painter
heard
it
he
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
began
shuffling
and
dancing
about
singing
we
inwite
you
to
the
wedding
an
we
a
glorious
time
where
the
boys
an
girls
is
an
we
all
get
drunk
on
wine
that
quite
enough
o
that
cried
the
landlord
roughly
do
want
that
row
the
stopped
and
looking
stupidly
at
the
old
dear
sank
abashed
on
to
the
seat
again
we
may
as
well
sit
as
stand
for
a
few
minutes
remarked
crass
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
the
others
followed
his
example
at
frequent
intervals
the
bar
was
entered
by
fresh
customers
most
of
them
working
men
on
their
way
home
who
ordered
and
drank
their
pint
or
of
ale
or
porter
and
left
at
once
bundy
began
reading
the
advertisement
of
the
circus
and
menageries
and
a
conversation
ensued
concerning
the
wonderful
performances
of
the
trained
animals
the
old
dear
said
that
some
of
them
had
as
much
sense
as
human
beings
and
the
manner
with
which
he
made
this
statement
implied
that
he
thought
it
was
a
testimonial
to
the
sagacity
of
the
brutes
he
further
said
that
he
had
heard
a
little
earlier
in
the
evening
a
rumour
that
one
of
the
wild
animals
a
bear
or
something
had
broken
loose
and
was
at
present
at
large
this
was
what
he
had
heard
he
did
know
if
it
were
true
or
not
for
his
own
part
he
did
believe
it
and
his
hearers
agreed
that
it
was
highly
improbable
nobody
ever
knew
how
these
silly
yarns
got
about
presently
the
besotted
wretch
got
up
and
taking
the
rings
out
of
the
net
with
a
trembling
hand
began
throwing
them
one
at
a
time
at
the
hooks
on
the
board
the
rest
of
the
company
watched
him
with
much
interest
laughing
when
he
made
a
very
bad
shot
and
applauding
when
he
scored
a
bit
orf
tonight
remarked
philpot
aside
to
easton
as
a
rule
a
fair
knockout
at
it
throws
a
splendid
ring
the
semidrunk
regarded
the
proceedings
of
the
besotted
wretch
with
an
expression
of
profound
contempt
ca
play
for
nuts
he
said
scornfully
i
i
can
play
you
anyway
you
are
i
play
you
for
drinks
round
cried
the
for
a
moment
the
besotted
wretch
hesitated
he
had
not
money
enough
to
pay
for
drinks
round
however
feeling
confident
of
winning
he
replied
on
then
what
it
to
be
fifty
up
you
like
fifty
or
a
or
a
bloody
million
make
it
fifty
for
a
start
right
play
first
if
you
like
right
agreed
the
anxious
to
distinguish
himself
holding
the
six
rings
in
his
left
hand
the
man
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
at
a
distance
of
about
three
yards
from
the
board
with
his
right
foot
advanced
taking
one
of
the
rings
between
the
forefinger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
closing
his
left
eye
he
carefully
the
centre
hook
no
then
he
slowly
extended
his
arm
to
its
full
length
in
the
direction
of
the
board
then
bending
his
elbow
he
brought
his
hand
back
again
until
it
nearly
touched
his
chin
and
slowly
extended
his
arm
again
he
repeated
these
movements
several
times
whilst
the
others
watched
with
bated
breath
getting
it
right
at
last
he
suddenly
shot
the
ring
at
the
board
but
it
did
not
go
on
no
it
went
over
the
partition
into
the
private
bar
this
feat
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
laughter
the
player
stared
at
the
board
in
a
dazed
way
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
ring
when
someone
in
the
next
bar
threw
it
over
the
partition
again
he
realized
what
had
happened
and
turning
to
the
company
with
a
sickly
smile
remarked
ai
got
properly
used
to
this
board
yet
that
the
reason
of
it
he
now
began
throwing
the
other
rings
at
the
board
rather
wildly
without
troubling
to
take
aim
one
struck
the
partition
to
the
right
of
the
board
one
to
the
left
one
underneath
one
went
over
the
counter
one
on
the
floor
the
other
the
last
hit
the
board
and
amid
a
shout
of
applause
caught
on
the
centre
hook
no
the
highest
number
it
was
possible
to
score
with
a
single
throw
shall
be
all
right
now
that
i
got
the
range
observed
the
as
he
made
way
for
his
opponent
see
something
now
whispered
philpot
to
easton
bloke
is
a
dandy
the
besotted
wretch
took
up
his
position
and
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
began
throwing
the
rings
it
was
really
a
remarkable
exhibition
for
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
his
hand
trembled
like
the
proverbial
aspen
leaf
he
succeeded
in
striking
the
board
almost
in
the
centre
every
time
but
somehow
or
other
most
of
them
failed
to
catch
on
the
hooks
and
fell
into
the
net
when
he
finished
his
innings
he
had
only
scored
two
of
the
rings
having
caught
on
the
no
hook
lines
remarked
bundy
as
he
finished
his
beer
and
put
the
glass
down
on
the
counter
up
and
another
said
easton
as
he
drained
his
own
glass
do
mind
if
i
do
replied
crass
pouring
what
remained
of
the
pint
down
his
throat
philpot
glass
had
been
empty
for
some
time
again
said
easton
addressing
the
old
dear
and
putting
six
pennies
on
the
counter
by
this
time
the
had
again
opened
fire
on
the
board
but
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
range
for
none
of
the
rings
scored
they
flew
all
over
the
place
and
he
finished
his
innings
without
increasing
his
total
the
besotted
wretch
now
sailed
in
and
speedily
piled
up
then
the
had
another
go
and
succeeded
in
getting
his
case
appeared
hopeless
but
his
opponent
in
his
next
innings
seemed
to
go
all
to
pieces
twice
he
missed
the
board
altogether
and
when
he
did
hit
it
he
failed
to
score
until
the
very
last
throw
when
he
made
then
the
went
in
again
and
got
the
scores
were
now
besotted
wretch
so
far
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
the
end
it
was
anybody
game
crass
became
so
excited
that
he
absentmindedly
opened
his
mouth
and
shot
his
second
pint
down
into
his
stomach
with
a
single
gulp
and
bundy
also
drained
his
glass
and
called
upon
philpot
and
easton
to
drink
up
and
have
another
which
they
accordingly
did
while
the
was
having
his
next
innings
the
besotted
wretch
placed
a
penny
on
the
counter
and
called
for
a
half
a
pint
which
he
drank
in
the
hope
of
steadying
his
nerves
for
a
great
effort
his
opponent
meanwhile
threw
the
rings
at
the
board
and
missed
it
every
time
but
all
the
same
he
scored
for
one
ring
after
striking
the
partition
about
a
foot
above
the
board
fell
down
and
caught
on
the
hook
the
other
man
now
began
his
innings
playing
very
carefully
and
nearly
every
ring
scored
as
he
played
the
others
uttered
exclamations
of
admiration
and
called
out
the
result
of
every
throw
again
no
got
two
the
accepted
his
defeat
with
a
good
grace
and
after
explaining
that
he
was
a
bit
out
of
practice
placed
a
shilling
on
the
counter
and
invited
the
company
to
give
their
orders
everyone
asked
for
same
again
but
the
landlord
served
easton
bundy
and
the
besotted
wretch
with
pints
instead
of
as
before
so
there
was
no
change
out
of
the
shilling
know
there
a
great
deal
in
not
bein
used
to
the
board
said
the
no
disgrace
in
bein
beat
by
a
man
like
mate
said
philpot
a
champion
there
no
mistake
about
it
throws
a
splendid
ring
said
bundy
this
was
the
general
verdict
the
though
beaten
was
not
disgraced
and
he
was
so
affected
by
the
good
feeling
manifested
by
the
company
that
he
presently
produced
a
sixpence
and
insisted
on
paying
for
another
all
round
crass
had
gone
outside
during
this
conversation
but
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
feel
a
bit
easier
now
he
remarked
with
a
laugh
as
he
took
the
glass
that
the
passed
to
him
with
a
shaking
hand
one
after
the
other
within
a
few
minutes
the
rest
followed
crass
example
going
outside
and
returning
almost
immediately
and
as
bundy
who
was
the
last
to
return
came
back
he
exclaimed
a
game
of
right
said
easton
who
was
beginning
to
feel
reckless
drink
up
first
and
let
another
he
had
only
sevenpence
left
just
enough
to
pay
for
another
pint
for
crass
and
half
a
pint
for
everyone
else
the
table
was
a
planed
mahogany
board
with
a
number
of
parallel
lines
scored
across
it
the
game
is
played
by
placing
the
coin
at
the
end
of
the
board
the
rim
slightly
overhanging
the
edge
and
striking
it
with
the
back
part
of
the

of
the
blow

inquired
philpot
of
the
landlord
whilst
easton
and
bundy
were
playing

was
the
barman
doing
a
bit
of
a
job
down
in
the
cellar
some
of
the
valves
gone
a
bit
wrong
but
the
missus
is
comin
down
to
lend
me
a
hand
presently
she
is
now
the
landlady
who
at
this
moment
entered
through
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
bar
was
a
large
woman
with
a
countenance
and
a
tremendous
bust
incased
in
a
black
dress
with
a
shot
silk
blouse
she
had
several
jewelled
gold
rings
on
the
fingers
of
each
fat
white
hand
and
a
long
gold
watch
guard
hung
round
her
fat
neck
she
greeted
crass
and
philpot
with
condescension
smiling
affably
upon
them
meantime
the
game
of
proceeded
merrily
the
taking
a
great
interest
in
it
and
tendering
advice
to
both
players
impartially
bundy
was
badly
beaten
and
then
easton
suggested
that
it
was
time
to
think
of
going
home
this
proposal
slightly
modified
met
with
general
approval
the
modification
being
suggested
by
philpot
who
insisted
on
standing
one
final
round
of
drinks
before
they
went
while
they
were
pouring
this
down
their
throats
crass
took
a
penny
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
put
it
in
the
slot
of
the
polyphone
the
landlord
put
a
fresh
disc
into
it
and
wound
it
up
and
it
began
to
play

of
the
bulldog
breed
the
happened
to
know
the
words
of
the
chorus
of
this
song
and
when
he
heard
the
music
he
started
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
with
many
fierce
looks
and
gestures
began
to
roar
at
the
top
of
his
voice
may

their
ships

had
been
possessed
of
when
he
first
came

had
no
money
left
now
a
fact
that
the
observant
and
experienced
landlord
had
divined
some
time
ago
he
therefore
wished
to
get
rid
of
the
fellow
before
the
drink
affected
him
further
and
made
him
helplessly

roared
out

a
voice

was
a
burly
young
man
about
or
years
of
age

growled
the
landlord
indicating
the
culprit
the
barman
instantly
vaulted
over
the
counter
and
having
opened
wide
the
door
leading
into
the
street
he
turned
to
the
man
and
jerking
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
door
said

said
the
firmly

my
but
before
he
could
conclude
the
barman
had
clutched
him
by
the
collar
dragged
him
violently
to
the
door
and
shot
him
into
the
middle
of
the
road
where
he
fell
in
a
heap
almost
under
the
wheels
of
a
brewer
dray
that
happened
to
be
passing
this
accomplished
alf
shut
the

and
retired
behind

counter

crass
to
philpot

nothing

philpot
made
no
reply
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
others
peeping
out
into
the
street
over
the
top
of
the
window
casing
then
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
street
crass
and
the
others
through
the
window
watched
him
assist
the
to
his
feet
and
rub
some
of
the
dirt
off
his
clothes
and
presently
after
some
argument
they
saw
the
two
go
away
together
arm
in
arm

and
the
others
laughed
and
returned
to
their
drinks

the
besotted
wretch
gulped
his
beer
down
as
quickly
as
he
could
with
his
eyes
fixed
greedily
on
philpot
glass
he
had
just
finished
his
own
and
was
about
to
suggest
that
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
the
porter
when
philpot
unexpectedly
reappeared

be
all
right
i
think
the
fall
sobered
a
bit
all
right
said
crass
offhandedly
nothing
the
matter
with
philpot
now
drank
his
porter
and
bidding
night
to
the
old
dear
the
landlady
and
the
besotted
wretch
they
all
set
out
for
home
as
they
went
along
the
dark
and
lonely
thoroughfare
that
led
over
the
hill
to
windley
they
heard
from
time
to
time
the
weird
roaring
of
the
wild
animals
in
the
menagerie
that
was
encamped
in
the
adjacent
field
just
as
they
reached
a
very
gloomy
and
deserted
part
they
suddenly
observed
a
dark
object
in
the
middle
of
the
road
some
distance
in
front
of
them
it
seemed
to
be
a
large
animal
of
some
kind
and
was
coming
slowly
and
stealthily
towards
them
they
stopped
peering
in
a
way
through
the
darkness
the
animal
continued
to
approach
bundy
stooped
down
to
the
ground
groping
about
in
search
of
a
stone
and
with
the
exception
of
crass
who
was
too
frightened
to
move
the
others
followed
his
example
they
found
several
large
stones
and
stood
waiting
for
the
creature
whatever
it
was
to
come
a
little
nearer
so
as
to
get
a
fair
shot
at
it
they
were
about
to
let
fly
when
the
creature
fell
over
on
its
side
and
moaned
as
if
in
pain
observing
this
the
four
men
advanced
cautiously
towards
it
bundy
struck
a
match
and
held
it
over
the
prostrate
figure
it
was
the
after
parting
from
philpot
the
poor
wretch
had
managed
to
walk
all
right
for
some
distance
as
philpot
had
remarked
the
fall
had
to
some
extent
sobered
him
but
he
had
not
gone
very
far
before
the
drink
he
had
taken
began
to
affect
him
again
and
he
had
fallen
down
finding
it
impossible
to
get
up
he
began
crawling
along
on
his
hands
and
knees
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
travelling
in
the
wrong
direction
even
this
mode
of
progression
failed
him
at
last
and
he
would
probably
have
been
run
over
if
they
had
not
found
him
they
raised
him
up
and
philpot
exhorting
him
to
himself
together
inquired
where
he
lived
the
man
had
sense
enough
left
to
be
able
to
tell
them
his
address
which
was
fortunately
at
windley
where
they
all
resided
bundy
and
philpot
took
him
home
separating
from
crass
and
easton
at
the
corner
of
the
street
where
both
the
latter
lived
crass
felt
very
full
and
satisfied
with
himself
he
had
had
six
and
a
half
pints
of
beer
and
had
listened
to
two
selections
on
the
polyphone
at
a
total
cost
of
one
penny
easton
had
but
a
few
yards
to
go
before
reaching
his
own
house
after
parting
from
crass
but
he
paused
directly
he
heard
the
latter
door
close
and
leaning
against
a
street
lamp
yielded
to
the
feeling
of
giddiness
and
nausea
that
he
had
been
fighting
against
all
the
way
home
all
the
inanimate
objects
around
him
seemed
to
be
in
motion
the
lights
of
the
distant
street
lamps
appeared
to
be
floating
about
the
pavement
and
the
roadway
rose
and
fell
like
the
surface
of
a
troubled
sea
he
searched
his
pockets
for
his
handkerchief
and
having
found
it
wiped
his
mouth
inwardly
congratulating
himself
that
crass
was
not
there
to
see
him
resuming
his
walk
after
a
few
minutes
he
reached
his
own
home
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
closed
of
itself
after
him
clanging
loudly
he
went
rather
unsteadily
up
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
his
front
door
and
entered
the
baby
was
asleep
in
the
cradle
slyme
had
gone
up
to
his
own
room
and
ruth
was
sitting
sewing
by
the
fireside
the
table
was
still
set
for
two
persons
for
she
had
not
yet
taken
her
tea
easton
lurched
in
noisily
old
girl
he
cried
throwing
his
dinner
basket
carelessly
on
the
floor
with
an
affectation
of
joviality
and
resting
his
hands
on
the
table
to
support
himself
come
at
last
you
see
ruth
left
off
sewing
and
letting
her
hands
fall
into
her
lap
sat
looking
at
him
she
had
never
seen
him
like
this
before
his
face
was
ghastly
pale
the
eyes
bloodshot
and
the
lips
tremulous
and
moist
and
the
ends
of
the
hair
of
his
fair
moustache
stuck
together
with
saliva
and
stained
with
beer
hung
untidily
round
his
mouth
in
damp
clusters
perceiving
that
she
did
not
speak
or
smile
easton
concluded
that
she
was
angry
and
became
grave
himself
come
at
last
you
see
my
dear
better
late
than
never
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
speak
plainly
for
his
lips
trembled
and
refused
to
form
the
words
do
know
so
much
about
that
said
ruth
inclined
to
cry
and
trying
not
to
let
him
see
the
pity
she
could
not
help
feeling
for
him
nice
state
you
in
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
easton
shook
his
head
and
laughed
foolishly
be
angry
ruth
it
no
good
you
know
he
walked
clumsily
towards
her
still
leaning
on
the
table
to
steady
himself
be
angry
he
mumbled
as
he
stooped
over
her
putting
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
his
face
close
to
hers
no
good
being
angry
you
know
dear
she
shrank
away
shuddering
with
involuntary
disgust
as
he
pressed
his
wet
lips
and
filthy
moustache
upon
her
mouth
his
fetid
breath
foul
with
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
beer
and
the
odour
of
the
stale
tobacco
smoke
that
exuded
from
his
clothes
filled
her
with
loathing
he
kissed
her
repeatedly
and
when
at
last
he
released
her
she
hastily
wiped
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
shivered
easton
said
he
did
not
want
any
tea
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
almost
immediately
ruth
did
not
want
any
tea
either
now
although
she
had
been
very
hungry
before
he
came
home
she
sat
up
very
late
sewing
and
when
at
length
she
did
go
upstairs
she
found
him
lying
on
his
back
partly
undressed
on
the
outside
of
the
bedclothes
with
his
mouth
wide
open
breathing
stertorously
chapter
the
forty
thieves
the
battle
brigands
versus
bandits
this
is
an
even
more
unusually
dull
and
uninteresting
chapter
and
introduces
several
matters
that
may
appear
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
the
reader
is
nevertheless
entreated
to
peruse
it
because
it
contains
certain
information
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
this
history
the
town
of
mugsborough
was
governed
by
a
set
of
individuals
called
the
municipal
council
most
of
these
of
the
people
were
or
retired
tradesmen
in
the
opinion
of
the
inhabitants
of
mugsborough
the
fact
that
a
man
had
succeeded
in
accumulating
money
in
business
was
a
clear
demonstration
of
his
fitness
to
be
entrusted
with
the
business
of
the
town
consequently
when
that
very
able
and
successful
man
of
business
mr
george
rushton
was
put
up
for
election
to
the
council
he
was
returned
by
a
large
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
working
men
who
thought
him
an
ideal
personage
these
brigands
did
just
as
they
pleased
no
one
ever
interfered
with
them
they
never
consulted
the
ratepayers
in
any
way
even
at
election
time
they
did
not
trouble
to
hold
meetings
each
one
of
them
just
issued
a
kind
of
manifesto
setting
forth
his
many
noble
qualities
and
calling
upon
the
people
for
their
votes
and
the
latter
never
failed
to
respond
they
elected
the
same
old
crew
time
after
time
the
brigands
committed
their
depredations
almost
unhindered
for
the
voters
were
engaged
in
the
battle
of
life
take
the
public
park
for
instance
like
so
many
swine
around
a
trough
they
were
so
busily
engaged
in
this
battle
that
most
of
them
had
no
time
to
go
to
the
park
or
they
might
have
noticed
that
there
were
not
so
many
costly
plants
there
as
there
should
have
been
and
if
they
had
inquired
further
they
would
have
discovered
that
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
town
council
had
very
fine
gardens
there
was
reason
for
these
gardens
being
so
grand
for
the
public
park
was
systematically
robbed
of
its
best
to
make
them
so
there
was
a
lake
in
the
park
where
large
numbers
of
ducks
and
geese
were
kept
at
the
ratepayers
expense
in
addition
to
the
food
provided
for
these
fowl
with
public
money
visitors
to
the
park
used
to
bring
them
bags
of
biscuits
and
bread
crusts
when
the
ducks
and
geese
were
nicely
fattened
the
brigands
used
to
carry
them
off
and
devour
them
at
home
when
they
became
tired
of
eating
duck
or
goose
some
of
the
councillors
made
arrangements
with
certain
butchers
and
traded
away
the
birds
for
meat
one
of
the
most
energetic
members
of
the
band
was
mr
jeremiah
didlum
the
who
did
a
large
hire
system
trade
he
had
an
extensive
stock
of
furniture
that
he
had
resumed
possession
of
when
the
unfortunate
purchasers
failed
to
pay
the
instalments
regularly
other
of
the
things
had
been
purchased
for
a
fraction
of
their
real
value
at
sheriff
sales
or
from
people
whom
misfortune
or
want
of
employment
had
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
selling
their
household
possessions
another
notable
member
of
the
band
was
mr
amos
grinder
who
had
practically
monopolized
the
greengrocery
trade
and
now
owned
nearly
all
the
fruiterers
shops
in
the
town
as
for
the
other
shops
if
they
did
not
buy
their
stocks
from
him
or
rather
the
company
of
which
he
was
managing
director
and
principal
shareholder
if
these
other
fruiterers
and
greengrocers
did
not
buy
their
stuff
from
his
company
he
tried
to
smash
them
by
opening
branches
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
and
selling
below
cost
he
was
a
man
an
example
of
what
may
be
accomplished
by
cunning
and
selfishness
then
there
was
the
chief
of
the
band
mr
adam
sweater
the
mayor
he
was
always
the
chief
although
he
was
not
always
mayor
it
being
the
rule
that
the
latter
should
be
enjoyed
by
all
the
members
of
the
band
in
turn
a
bright
forsooth
to
be
the
first
citizen
in
a
community
composed
for
the
most
part
of
ignorant
slaves
and
hypocrites
mr
sweater
was
the
managing
director
and
principal
shareholder
of
a
large
drapery
business
in
which
he
had
amassed
a
considerable
fortune
this
was
not
very
surprising
considering
that
he
paid
none
of
his
workpeople
fair
wages
and
many
of
them
no
wages
at
all
he
employed
a
great
number
of
girls
and
young
women
who
were
supposed
to
be
learning
dressmaking
or
millinery
these
were
all
indentured
apprentices
some
of
whom
had
paid
premiums
of
from
five
to
ten
pounds
they
were
for
three
years
for
the
first
two
years
they
received
no
wages
the
third
year
they
got
a
shilling
or
eightpence
a
week
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
they
usually
got
the
sack
unless
they
were
willing
to
stay
on
as
improvers
at
from
three
shillings
to
four
and
sixpence
per
week
they
worked
from
half
past
eight
in
the
morning
till
eight
at
night
with
an
interval
of
an
hour
for
dinner
and
at
half
past
four
they
ceased
work
for
fifteen
minutes
for
tea
this
was
provided
by
the
firm
half
a
pint
for
each
girl
but
they
had
to
bring
their
own
milk
and
sugar
and
bread
and
butter
few
of
the
girls
ever
learned
their
trades
thoroughly
some
were
taught
to
make
sleeves
others
cuffs
or
and
so
on
the
result
was
that
in
a
short
time
each
one
became
very
expert
and
quick
at
one
thing
and
although
their
proficiency
in
this
one
thing
would
never
enable
them
to
earn
a
decent
living
it
enabled
mr
sweater
to
make
money
during
the
period
of
their
apprenticeship
and
that
was
all
he
cared
about
occasionally
a
girl
of
intelligence
and
spirit
would
insist
on
the
fulfilment
of
the
terms
of
her
indentures
and
sometimes
the
parents
would
protest
if
this
were
persisted
in
those
girls
got
on
better
but
even
these
were
turned
to
good
account
by
the
wily
sweater
who
induced
the
best
of
them
to
remain
after
their
time
was
up
by
paying
them
what
appeared
by
contrast
with
the
others
girls
money
good
wages
sometimes
even
seven
or
eight
shillings
a
week
and
liberal
promises
of
future
advancement
these
girls
then
became
a
sort
of
reserve
who
could
be
called
up
to
crush
any
manifestation
of
discontent
on
the
part
of
the
leading
hands
the
greater
number
of
the
girls
however
submitted
tamely
to
the
conditions
imposed
upon
them
they
were
too
young
to
realize
the
wrong
that
was
being
done
them
as
for
their
parents
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
so
good
a
man
as
mr
sweater
who
was
always
prominent
in
every
good
and
charitable
work
at
the
expiration
of
the
girl
apprenticeship
if
the
parents
complained
of
her
want
of
proficiency
the
pious
sweater
would
attribute
it
to
idleness
or
incapacity
and
as
the
people
were
generally
poor
he
seldom
or
never
had
any
trouble
with
them
this
was
how
he
fulfilled
the
unctuous
promise
made
to
the
confiding
parents
at
the
time
the
girl
was
handed
over
to
his
tender
mercy
that
he
would
a
woman
of
her
this
method
of
obtaining
labour
by
false
pretences
and
without
payment
which
enabled
him
to
produce
costly
articles
for
a
mere
fraction
of
the
price
for
which
they
were
eventually
sold
was
adopted
in
other
departments
of
his
business
he
procured
shop
assistants
of
both
sexes
on
the
same
terms
a
youth
was
indentured
usually
for
five
years
to
be
a
man
of
and
out
fit
to
take
a
position
in
any
house
if
possible
a
premium
five
ten
or
twenty
pounds
according
to
their
circumstances
would
be
extracted
from
the
parents
for
the
first
three
years
no
wages
after
that
perhaps
two
or
three
shillings
a
week
at
the
end
of
the
five
years
the
work
of
a
man
of
him
would
be
completed
mr
sweater
would
then
congratulate
him
and
assure
him
that
he
was
qualified
to
assume
a
in
any
house
but
regret
that
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
him
in
his
business
was
so
bad
still
if
the
man
wished
he
might
stay
on
until
he
secured
a
better
and
as
a
matter
of
generosity
although
he
did
not
really
need
the
man
services
he
would
pay
him
ten
shillings
per
week
provided
he
was
not
addicted
to
drinking
smoking
gambling
or
the
stock
exchange
or
going
to
theatres
the
young
man
future
was
thus
assured
even
if
he
were
unsuccessful
in
his
efforts
to
obtain
another
position
he
could
save
a
portion
of
his
salary
and
eventually
commence
business
on
his
own
account
however
the
branch
of
mr
sweater
business
to
which
it
is
desired
to
especially
direct
the
reader
attention
was
the
homeworkers
department
he
employed
a
large
number
of
women
making
blouses
fancy
aprons
and
children
pinafores
most
of
these
articles
were
disposed
of
wholesale
in
london
and
elsewhere
but
some
were
retailed
at
emporium
in
mugsborough
and
at
the
firm
other
retail
establishments
throughout
the
county
many
of
the
women
workers
were
widows
with
children
who
were
glad
to
obtain
any
employment
that
did
not
take
them
away
from
their
homes
and
families
the
blouses
were
paid
for
at
the
rate
of
from
two
shillings
to
five
shillings
a
dozen
the
women
having
to
provide
their
own
machine
and
cotton
besides
calling
for
and
delivering
the
work
these
poor
women
were
able
to
clear
from
six
to
eight
shillings
a
week
and
to
earn
even
that
they
had
to
work
almost
incessantly
for
fourteen
or
sixteen
hours
a
day
there
was
no
time
for
cooking
and
very
little
to
cook
for
they
lived
principally
on
bread
and
margarine
and
tea
their
homes
were
squalid
their
children
and
raggedly
clothed
in
grotesque
garments
hastily
fashioned
out
of
the
clothes
of
charitable
neighbours
but
it
was
not
in
vain
that
these
women
toiled
every
weary
day
until
exhaustion
compelled
them
to
cease
it
was
not
in
vain
that
they
passed
their
cheerless
lives
bending
with
aching
shoulders
over
the
thankless
work
that
barely
brought
them
bread
it
was
not
in
vain
that
they
and
their
children
went
famished
and
in
rags
for
after
all
the
principal
object
of
their
labour
was
accomplished
the
good
cause
was
advanced
mr
sweater
waxed
rich
and
increased
in
goods
and
respectability
of
course
none
of
those
women
were
compelled
to
engage
in
that
glorious
cause
no
one
is
compelled
to
accept
any
particular
set
of
conditions
in
a
free
country
like
this
mr
trafaim
the
manager
of
sweater
homework
department
always
put
the
matter
before
them
in
the
plainest
fairest
possible
way
there
was
the
work
that
was
the
figure
and
those
who
did
like
it
could
leave
it
there
was
no
compulsion
sometimes
some
perverse
creature
belonging
to
that
numerous
class
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
did
leave
it
but
as
the
manager
said
there
were
plenty
of
others
who
were
only
too
glad
to
take
it
in
fact
such
was
the
enthusiasm
amongst
these
women
especially
such
of
them
as
had
little
children
to
provide
for
and
such
was
their
zeal
for
the
cause
that
some
of
them
have
been
known
to
positively
beg
to
be
allowed
to
work
by
these
and
similar
means
adam
sweater
had
contrived
to
lay
up
for
himself
a
large
amount
of
treasure
upon
earth
besides
attaining
undoubted
respectability
for
that
he
was
respectable
no
one
questioned
he
went
to
chapel
twice
every
sunday
his
obese
figure
arrayed
in
costly
apparel
consisting
with
other
things
of
grey
trousers
a
long
garment
called
a
a
tall
silk
hat
a
quantity
of
jewellery
and
a
bible
he
was
an
official
of
some
sort
of
the
shining
light
chapel
his
name
appeared
in
nearly
every
published
list
of
charitable
subscriptions
no
starving
wretch
had
ever
appealed
to
him
in
vain
for
a
penny
soup
ticket
small
wonder
that
when
this
good
and
man
offered
his
services
to
the
town
free
of
charge
the
intelligent
working
men
of
mugsborough
accepted
his
offer
with
enthusiastic
applause
the
fact
that
he
had
made
money
in
business
was
a
proof
of
his
intellectual
capacity
his
benevolence
was
a
guarantee
that
his
abilities
would
be
used
to
further
not
his
own
private
interests
but
the
interests
of
every
section
of
the
community
especially
those
of
the
working
classes
of
whom
the
majority
of
his
constituents
was
composed
as
for
the
shopkeepers
they
were
all
so
absorbed
in
their
own
business
so
busily
engaged
chasing
their
employees
adding
up
their
accounts
and
dressing
themselves
up
in
feeble
imitation
of
the
that
they
were
incapable
of
taking
a
really
intelligent
interest
in
anything
else
they
thought
of
the
town
council
as
a
kind
of
paradise
reserved
exclusively
for
and
successful
tradesmen
possibly
some
day
if
they
succeeded
in
making
money
they
might
become
town
councillors
themselves
but
in
the
meantime
public
affairs
were
no
particular
concern
of
theirs
so
some
of
them
voted
for
adam
sweater
because
he
was
a
liberal
and
some
of
them
voted
against
him
for
the
same
now
and
then
when
details
of
some
unusually
scandalous
proceeding
of
the
council
leaked
out
the
townspeople
roused
for
a
brief
space
from
their
customary
indifference
would
discuss
the
matter
in
a
casual
helpless
sort
of
way
but
always
as
if
it
were
something
that
did
not
directly
concern
them
it
was
during
some
such
nine
days
wonder
that
the
title
of
forty
thieves
was
bestowed
on
the
members
of
the
council
by
their
constituents
who
not
possessing
sufficient
intelligence
to
devise
means
of
punishing
the
culprits
affected
to
regard
the
manoeuvres
of
the
brigands
as
a
huge
joke
there
was
only
one
member
of
the
council
who
did
not
belong
to
the
band
councillor
weakling
a
retired
physician
but
unfortunately
he
also
was
a
respectable
man
when
he
saw
something
going
forwards
that
he
did
not
think
was
right
he
protested
and
voted
against
it
and
then
he
collapsed
there
was
nothing
of
the
low
agitator
about
him
as
for
the
brigands
they
laughed
at
his
protests
and
his
vote
did
not
matter
with
this
one
exception
the
other
members
of
the
band
were
very
similar
in
character
to
sweater
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
they
had
all
joined
the
band
with
the
same
objects
and
the
advancement
of
their
private
interests
these
were
the
real
reasons
why
they
besought
the
ratepayers
to
elect
them
to
the
council
but
of
course
none
of
them
ever
admitted
that
such
was
the
case
no
when
these
altruists
offered
their
services
to
the
town
they
asked
the
people
to
believe
that
they
were
actuated
by
a
desire
to
give
their
time
and
abilities
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
interests
of
others
which
was
much
the
same
as
asking
them
to
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
the
leopard
to
change
his
spots
owing
to
the
extraordinary
apathy
of
the
other
inhabitants
the
brigands
were
able
to
carry
out
their
depredations
undisturbed
daylight
robberies
were
of
frequent
occurrence
for
many
years
these
brigands
had
looked
with
greedy
eyes
upon
the
huge
profits
of
the
gas
company
they
thought
it
was
a
beastly
shame
that
those
other
bandits
should
be
always
raiding
the
town
and
getting
clear
away
with
such
rich
spoils
at
length
about
two
years
ago
after
much
study
and
many
private
consultations
a
plan
of
campaign
was
evolved
a
secret
council
of
war
was
held
presided
over
by
mr
sweater
and
the
brigands
formed
themselves
into
an
association
called
mugsborough
electric
light
supply
and
installation
coy
and
bound
themselves
by
a
solemn
oath
to
do
their
best
to
drive
the
gas
works
bandits
out
of
the
town
and
to
capture
the
spoils
at
present
enjoyed
by
the
latter
for
themselves
there
was
a
large
piece
of
ground
the
property
of
the
town
that
was
a
suitable
site
for
the
works
so
in
their
character
of
directors
of
the
electric
light
coy
they
offered
to
buy
this
land
from
the
municipality
or
in
other
words
from
themselves
for
about
half
its
value
at
the
meeting
of
the
town
council
when
this
offer
was
considered
all
the
members
present
with
the
solitary
exception
of
dr
weakling
being
shareholders
in
the
newly
formed
company
councillor
rushton
moved
a
resolution
in
favour
of
accepting
it
he
said
that
every
encouragement
should
be
given
to
the
promoters
of
the
electric
light
those
citizens
who
had
come
forward
and
were
willing
to
risk
their
capital
in
an
undertaking
that
would
be
a
benefit
to
every
class
of
residents
in
the
town
that
they
all
loved
so
well
applause
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
introduction
of
the
electric
light
would
be
a
great
addition
to
the
attractions
of
mugsborough
but
there
was
another
and
more
urgent
reason
that
disposed
him
to
do
whatever
he
could
to
encourage
the
company
to
proceed
with
this
work
unfortunately
as
was
usual
at
that
time
of
the
year
mr
voice
trembled
with
emotion
the
town
was
full
of
unemployed
the
mayor
alderman
sweater
and
all
the
other
councillors
shook
their
heads
sadly
they
were
visibly
affected
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
starting
of
that
work
at
that
time
would
be
an
inestimable
boon
to
the
as
the
representative
of
a
ward
he
was
in
favour
of
accepting
the
offer
of
the
company
hear
hear
councillor
didlum
seconded
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
nothing
short
of
a
crime
to
oppose
anything
that
would
provide
work
for
the
unemployed
councillor
weakling
moved
that
the
offer
be
refused
shame
he
admitted
that
the
electric
light
would
be
an
improvement
to
the
town
and
in
view
of
the
existing
distress
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
work
started
but
the
price
mentioned
was
altogether
too
low
it
was
not
more
than
half
the
value
of
the
land
derisive
laughter
councillor
grinder
said
he
was
astonished
at
the
attitude
taken
up
by
councillor
weakling
in
his
grinder
opinion
it
was
disgraceful
that
a
member
of
the
council
should
deliberately
try
to
wreck
a
project
which
would
do
so
much
towards
relieving
the
unemployed
the
mayor
alderman
sweater
said
that
he
could
not
allow
the
amendment
to
be
discussed
until
it
was
seconded
if
there
were
no
seconder
he
would
put
the
original
motion
there
was
no
seconder
because
everyone
except
weakling
was
in
favour
of
the
resolution
which
was
carried
amid
loud
cheers
and
the
representatives
of
the
ratepayers
proceeded
to
the
consideration
of
the
next
business
councillor
didlum
proposed
that
the
duty
on
all
coal
brought
into
the
borough
be
raised
from
two
shillings
to
three
shillings
per
ton
councillor
rushton
seconded
the
largest
consumer
of
coal
was
the
gas
and
considering
the
great
profits
made
by
that
company
they
were
quite
justified
in
increasing
the
duty
to
the
highest
figure
the
act
permitted
after
a
feeble
protest
from
weakling
who
said
it
would
only
increase
the
price
of
gas
and
coal
without
interfering
with
the
profits
of
the
gas
this
was
also
carried
and
after
some
other
business
had
been
transacted
the
band
dispersed
that
meeting
was
held
two
years
ago
and
since
that
time
the
electric
light
works
had
been
built
and
the
war
against
the
gasworks
carried
on
vigorously
after
several
encounters
in
which
they
lost
a
few
customers
and
a
portion
of
the
public
lighting
the
gasworks
bandits
retreated
out
of
the
town
and
entrenched
themselves
in
a
strong
position
beyond
the
borough
boundary
where
they
erected
a
number
of
gasometers
they
were
thus
enabled
to
pour
gas
into
the
town
at
long
range
without
having
to
pay
the
coal
dues
this
masterly
stratagem
created
something
like
a
panic
in
the
ranks
of
the
forty
thieves
at
the
end
of
two
years
they
found
themselves
exhausted
with
the
protracted
campaign
their
movements
hampered
by
a
lot
of
plant
and
antiquated
machinery
and
harassed
on
every
side
by
the
lower
charges
of
the
gas
coy
they
were
reluctantly
constrained
to
admit
that
the
attempt
to
undermine
the
gasworks
was
a
melancholy
failure
and
that
the
mugsborough
electric
light
and
installation
coy
was
a
veritable
white
elephant
they
began
to
ask
themselves
what
they
should
do
with
it
and
some
of
them
even
urged
unconditional
surrender
or
an
appeal
to
the
arbitration
of
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
midst
of
all
the
confusion
and
demoralization
there
was
however
one
man
who
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
who
in
this
dark
hour
of
disaster
remained
calm
and
immovable
and
like
a
vast
mountain
of
flesh
reared
his
head
above
the
storm
whose
mighty
intellect
perceived
a
way
to
turn
this
apparently
hopeless
defeat
into
a
glorious
victory
that
man
was
adam
sweater
the
chief
of
the
band
chapter
the
reign
of
terror
the
great
money
trick
during
the
next
four
weeks
the
usual
reign
of
terror
continued
at
cave
the
men
slaved
like
so
many
convicts
under
the
vigilant
surveillance
of
crass
misery
and
rushton
no
one
felt
free
from
observation
for
a
single
moment
it
happened
frequently
that
a
man
who
was
working
alone
as
he
thought
on
turning
round
would
find
hunter
or
rushton
standing
behind
him
or
one
would
look
up
from
his
work
to
catch
sight
of
a
face
watching
him
through
a
door
or
a
window
or
over
the
banisters
if
they
happened
to
be
working
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
or
at
a
window
on
any
floor
they
knew
that
both
rushton
and
hunter
were
in
the
habit
of
hiding
among
the
trees
that
surrounded
the
house
and
spying
upon
them
thus
there
was
a
plumber
working
outside
repairing
the
guttering
that
ran
round
the
bottom
edge
of
the
roof
this
poor
wretch
life
was
a
perfect
misery
he
fancied
he
saw
hunter
or
rushton
in
every
bush
he
had
two
ladders
to
work
from
and
since
these
ladders
had
been
in
use
misery
had
thought
of
a
new
way
of
spying
on
the
men
finding
that
he
never
succeeded
in
catching
anyone
doing
anything
wrong
when
he
entered
the
house
by
one
of
the
doors
misery
adopted
the
plan
of
crawling
up
one
of
the
ladders
getting
in
through
one
of
the
upper
windows
and
creeping
softly
downstairs
and
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
even
then
he
never
caught
anyone
but
that
did
not
matter
for
he
accomplished
his
principal
purpose
every
man
seemed
afraid
to
cease
working
for
even
an
instant
the
result
of
all
this
was
of
course
that
the
work
progressed
rapidly
towards
completion
the
hands
grumbled
and
cursed
but
all
the
same
every
man
tore
into
it
for
all
he
was
worth
although
he
did
next
to
nothing
himself
crass
watched
and
urged
on
the
others
he
was
charge
of
the
job
he
knew
that
unless
he
succeeded
in
making
this
work
pay
he
would
not
be
put
in
charge
of
another
job
on
the
other
hand
if
he
did
make
it
pay
he
would
be
given
the
preference
over
others
and
be
kept
on
as
long
as
the
firm
had
any
work
the
firm
would
give
him
the
preference
only
as
long
as
it
paid
them
to
do
so
as
for
the
hands
each
man
knew
that
there
was
no
chance
of
obtaining
work
anywhere
else
at
present
there
were
dozens
of
men
out
of
employment
already
besides
even
if
there
had
been
a
chance
of
getting
another
job
somewhere
else
they
knew
that
the
conditions
were
more
or
less
the
same
on
every
firm
some
were
even
worse
than
this
one
each
man
knew
that
unless
he
did
as
much
as
ever
he
could
crass
would
report
him
for
being
slow
they
knew
also
that
when
the
job
began
to
draw
to
a
close
the
number
of
men
employed
upon
it
would
be
reduced
and
when
that
time
came
the
hands
who
did
the
most
work
would
be
kept
on
and
the
slower
ones
discharged
it
was
therefore
in
the
hope
of
being
one
of
the
favoured
few
that
while
inwardly
cursing
the
rest
for
into
it
everyone
as
a
matter
of
went
and
into
it
themselves
they
all
cursed
crass
but
most
of
them
would
have
been
very
glad
to
change
places
with
him
and
if
any
one
of
them
had
been
in
his
place
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
act
in
the
same
way
or
lose
the
job
they
all
reviled
hunter
but
most
of
them
would
have
been
glad
to
change
places
with
him
also
and
if
any
one
of
them
had
been
in
his
place
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
do
the
same
things
or
lose
the
job
they
all
hated
and
blamed
rushton
yet
if
they
had
been
in
place
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
adopt
the
same
methods
or
become
bankrupt
for
it
is
obvious
that
the
only
way
to
compete
successfully
against
other
employers
who
are
sweaters
is
to
be
a
sweater
yourself
therefore
no
one
who
is
an
upholder
of
the
present
system
can
consistently
blame
any
of
these
men
blame
the
system
if
you
reader
had
been
one
of
the
hands
would
you
have
slogged
or
would
you
have
preferred
to
starve
and
see
your
family
starve
if
you
had
been
in
crass
place
would
you
have
resigned
rather
than
do
such
dirty
work
if
you
had
had
hunter
berth
would
you
have
given
it
up
and
voluntarily
reduced
yourself
to
the
level
of
the
hands
if
you
had
been
rushton
would
you
rather
have
become
bankrupt
than
treat
your
and
your
customers
in
the
same
way
as
your
competitors
treated
theirs
it
may
be
that
so
placed
you
being
the
paragon
that
you
are
would
have
behaved
unselfishly
but
no
one
has
any
right
to
expect
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
who
would
only
call
you
a
fool
for
your
pains
it
may
be
true
that
if
any
one
of
the
hands
owen
for
instance
had
been
an
employer
of
labour
he
would
have
done
the
same
as
other
employers
some
people
seem
to
think
that
proves
that
the
present
system
is
all
right
but
really
it
only
proves
that
the
present
system
compels
selfishness
one
must
either
trample
upon
others
or
be
trampled
upon
oneself
happiness
might
be
possible
if
everyone
were
unselfish
if
everyone
thought
of
the
welfare
of
his
neighbour
before
thinking
of
his
own
but
as
there
is
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
such
unselfish
people
in
the
world
the
present
system
has
made
the
earth
into
a
sort
of
hell
under
the
present
system
there
is
not
sufficient
of
anything
for
everyone
to
have
enough
consequently
there
is
a
fight
called
by
christians
the
of
life
in
this
fight
some
get
more
than
they
need
some
barely
enough
some
very
little
and
some
none
at
all
the
more
aggressive
cunning
unfeeling
and
selfish
you
are
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
as
long
as
this
of
life
system
endures
we
have
no
right
to
blame
other
people
for
doing
the
same
things
that
we
are
ourselves
compelled
to
do
blame
the
system
but
that
is
just
what
the
hands
did
not
do
they
blamed
each
other
they
blamed
crass
and
hunter
and
rushton
but
with
the
great
system
of
which
they
were
all
more
or
less
the
victims
they
were
quite
content
being
persuaded
that
it
was
the
only
one
possible
and
the
best
that
human
wisdom
could
devise
the
reason
why
they
all
believed
this
was
because
not
one
of
them
had
ever
troubled
to
inquire
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
order
things
differently
they
were
content
with
the
present
system
if
they
had
not
been
content
they
would
have
been
anxious
to
find
some
way
to
alter
it
but
they
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
seriously
inquire
whether
it
was
possible
to
find
some
better
way
and
although
they
all
knew
in
a
hazy
fashion
that
other
methods
of
managing
the
affairs
of
the
world
had
already
been
proposed
they
neglected
to
inquire
whether
these
other
methods
were
possible
or
practicable
and
they
were
ready
and
willing
to
oppose
with
ignorant
ridicule
or
brutal
force
any
man
who
was
foolish
or
quixotic
enough
to
try
to
explain
to
them
the
details
of
what
he
thought
was
a
better
way
they
accepted
the
present
system
in
the
same
way
as
they
accepted
the
alternating
seasons
they
knew
that
there
was
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
and
winter
as
to
how
these
different
seasons
came
to
be
or
what
caused
them
they
had
the
remotest
notion
and
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
question
had
ever
occurred
to
any
of
them
but
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
about
the
fact
that
none
of
them
knew
from
their
infancy
they
had
been
trained
to
distrust
their
own
intelligence
and
to
leave
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
for
that
matter
of
the
next
world
too
to
their
betters
and
now
most
of
them
were
absolutely
incapable
of
thinking
of
any
abstract
subject
whatever
nearly
all
their
betters
that
is
the
people
who
do
nothing
were
unanimous
in
agreeing
that
the
present
system
is
a
very
good
one
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
alter
or
improve
it
therefore
crass
and
his
mates
although
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
themselves
accepted
it
as
an
established
incontrovertible
fact
that
the
existing
state
of
things
is
immutable
they
believed
it
because
someone
else
told
them
so
they
would
have
believed
anything
on
one
condition
namely
that
they
were
told
to
believe
it
by
their
betters
they
said
it
was
surely
not
for
the
like
of
them
to
think
that
they
knew
better
than
those
who
were
more
educated
and
had
plenty
of
time
to
study
as
the
work
in
the
proceeded
crass
abandoned
the
hope
that
owen
was
going
to
make
a
mess
of
it
some
of
the
rooms
upstairs
being
now
ready
for
papering
slyme
was
started
on
that
work
bert
being
taken
away
from
owen
to
assist
slyme
as
paste
boy
and
it
was
arranged
that
crass
should
help
owen
whenever
he
needed
someone
to
lend
him
a
hand
sweater
came
frequently
during
these
four
weeks
being
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
work
on
these
occasions
crass
always
managed
to
be
present
in
the
and
did
most
of
the
talking
owen
was
very
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
for
he
was
always
ill
at
ease
when
conversing
with
a
man
like
sweater
who
spoke
in
an
offensively
patronizing
way
and
expected
common
people
to
kowtow
to
and
him
at
every
second
word
crass
however
seemed
to
enjoy
doing
that
kind
of
thing
he
did
not
exactly
grovel
on
the
floor
when
sweater
spoke
to
him
but
he
contrived
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
was
willing
to
do
so
if
desired
outside
the
house
bundy
and
his
mates
had
dug
deep
trenches
in
the
damp
ground
in
which
they
were
laying
new
drains
this
work
like
that
of
the
painting
of
the
inside
of
the
house
was
nearly
completed
it
was
a
miserable
job
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
spell
of
bad
weather
the
ground
was
sodden
with
rain
and
there
was
mud
everywhere
the
men
clothing
and
boots
being
caked
with
it
but
the
worst
thing
about
the
job
was
the
smell
for
years
the
old
had
been
defective
and
leaky
the
ground
a
few
feet
below
the
surface
was
saturated
with
fetid
moisture
and
a
stench
as
of
a
thousand
putrefying
corpse
emanated
from
the
opened
earth
the
clothing
of
the
men
who
were
working
in
the
trenches
became
saturated
with
this
fearful
odour
and
for
that
matter
so
did
the
men
themselves
they
said
they
could
smell
and
taste
it
all
the
time
even
when
they
were
away
from
the
work
at
home
and
when
they
were
at
meals
although
they
smoked
their
pipes
all
the
time
they
were
at
work
misery
having
ungraciously
given
them
permission
several
times
bundy
and
one
or
other
of
his
mates
were
attacked
with
fits
of
vomiting
but
as
they
began
to
realize
that
the
finish
of
the
job
was
in
sight
a
kind
of
panic
seized
upon
the
hands
especially
those
who
had
been
taken
on
last
and
who
would
therefore
be
the
first
to
be
still
easton
however
felt
pretty
confident
that
crass
would
do
his
best
to
get
him
kept
on
till
the
end
of
the
job
for
they
had
become
quite
chummy
lately
usually
spending
a
few
evenings
together
at
the
cricketers
every
week
be
a
bloody
slaughter
soon
remarked
harlow
to
philpot
one
day
as
they
were
painting
the
banisters
of
the
staircase

next
week

about
finish

philpot
gloomily
i

either

that
little
place
they
call

kiosk

the
grand
parade

harlow

a
pause

used
to
sell
refreshments

the
corporation

philpot

job
for
some
poor
b
rs
wonder
if
they
started
anyone
yet
on
the
venetian
blinds
for
this
remarked
easton
after
a
pause
do
know
replied
philpot
they
relapsed
into
silence
for
a
while
wonder
what
time
it
is
said
philpot
at
length
do
know
you
feel
but
i
begin
to
want
my
dinner
just
what
i
was
thinking
it
ca
be
very
far
off
it
now
nearly
an
hour
since
bert
went
down
to
make
the
tea
it
seems
a
of
a
long
morning
to
me
it
does
to
me
said
philpot
upstairs
and
ask
slyme
what
time
it
is
harlow
laid
his
brush
across
the
top
of
his
and
went
upstairs
he
was
wearing
a
pair
of
cloth
slippers
and
walked
softly
not
wishing
that
crass
should
hear
him
leaving
his
work
so
it
happened
that
without
any
intention
of
spying
on
slyme
harlow
reached
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
former
was
working
without
being
heard
and
entering
suddenly
surprised
slyme
who
was
standing
near
the
fireplace
in
the
act
of
breaking
a
whole
roll
of
wallpaper
across
his
knee
as
one
might
break
a
stick
on
the
floor
beside
him
was
what
had
been
another
roll
now
broken
into
two
pieces
when
harlow
came
in
slyme
started
and
his
face
became
crimson
with
confusion
he
hastily
gathered
the
broken
rolls
together
and
stooping
down
thrust
the
pieces
up
the
flue
of
the
grate
and
closed
the
register
the
bloody
game
inquired
harlow
slyme
laughed
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
but
his
hands
trembled
and
his
face
was
now
very
pale
must
get
our
own
back
somehow
you
know
fred
he
said
harlow
did
not
reply
he
did
not
understand
after
puzzling
over
it
for
a
few
minutes
he
gave
it
up
the
time
he
asked
minutes
to
twelve
said
slyme
and
added
as
harlow
was
going
away
mention
anything
about
that
paper
to
crass
or
any
of
the
others
sha
say
nothing
replied
harlow
gradually
as
he
pondered
over
it
harlow
began
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
destruction
of
the
two
rolls
of
paper
slyme
was
doing
the
paperhanging
piecework
so
much
for
each
roll
hung
four
of
the
rooms
upstairs
had
been
done
with
the
same
pattern
and
hunter
who
was
not
in
such
matters
had
evidently
sent
more
paper
than
was
necessary
by
getting
rid
of
these
two
rolls
slyme
would
be
able
to
make
it
appear
that
he
had
hung
two
rolls
more
than
was
really
the
case
he
had
broken
the
rolls
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
them
away
from
the
house
without
being
detected
and
he
had
hidden
them
up
the
chimney
until
he
got
an
opportunity
of
so
doing
harlow
had
just
arrived
at
this
solution
of
the
problem
when
hearing
the
lower
flight
of
stairs
creaking
he
peeped
over
and
observed
misery
crawling
up
he
had
come
to
see
if
anyone
had
stopped
work
before
the
proper
time
passing
the
two
workmen
without
speaking
he
ascended
to
the
next
floor
and
entered
the
room
where
slyme
was
better
not
do
this
room
yet
said
hunter
to
be
a
new
grate
and
mantelpiece
put
in
he
crossed
over
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
looking
at
it
thoughtfully
for
a
few
minutes
not
a
bad
little
grate
you
know
is
it
he
remarked
be
able
to
use
it
somewhere
or
other
it
all
right
said
slyme
whose
heart
was
beating
like
a
for
a
front
room
in
a
cottage
continued
misery
stooping
down
to
examine
it
more
closely
nothing
broke
that
i
can
see
he
put
his
hand
against
the
register
and
vainly
tried
to
push
it
open
there
something
wrong
he
remarked
pushing
harder
likely
a
brick
or
some
plaster
fallen
down
gasped
slyme
coming
to
misery
assistance
i
try
to
open
it
trouble
replied
nimrod
rising
to
his
feet
most
likely
what
you
say
i
see
that
the
new
grate
is
sent
up
after
dinner
bundy
can
fix
it
this
afternoon
and
then
you
can
go
on
papering
as
soon
as
you
like
with
this
misery
went
out
of
the
room
downstairs
and
away
from
the
house
and
slyme
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
then
he
knelt
down
and
opening
the
register
he
took
out
the
broken
rolls
of
paper
and
hid
them
up
the
chimney
of
the
next
room
while
he
was
doing
this
the
sound
of
crass
whistle
shrilled
through
the
house
gord
exclaimed
philpot
fervently
as
he
laid
his
brushes
on
the
top
of
his
pot
and
joined
in
the
general
rush
to
the
kitchen
the
scene
here
is
already
familiar
to
the
reader
for
seats
the
two
pairs
of
steps
laid
on
their
sides
parallel
to
each
other
about
eight
feet
apart
and
at
right
angles
to
the
fireplace
with
the
long
plank
placed
across
and
the
upturned
pails
and
the
drawers
of
the
dresser
the
floor
unswept
and
littered
with
dirt
scraps
of
paper
bits
of
plaster
pieces
of
lead
pipe
and
dried
mud
and
in
the
midst
the
steaming
bucket
of
stewed
tea
and
the
collection
of
cracked
cups
and
condensed
milk
tins
and
on
the
seats
the
men
in
their
shabby
and
in
some
cases
ragged
clothing
sitting
and
eating
their
coarse
food
and
cracking
jokes
it
was
a
pathetic
and
wonderful
and
at
the
same
time
a
despicable
spectacle
pathetic
that
human
beings
should
be
condemned
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
amid
such
surroundings
because
it
must
be
remembered
that
most
of
their
time
was
spent
on
some
job
or
other
when
cave
was
finished
they
would
go
to
some
similar
if
they
were
lucky
enough
to
find
one
wonderful
because
although
they
knew
that
they
did
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
great
work
of
producing
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
they
did
not
think
they
were
entitled
to
a
fair
share
of
the
good
things
they
helped
to
create
and
despicable
because
although
they
saw
their
children
condemned
to
the
same
life
of
degradation
hard
labour
and
privation
yet
they
refused
to
help
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
most
of
them
thought
that
what
had
been
good
enough
for
themselves
was
good
enough
for
their
children
it
seemed
as
if
they
regarded
their
own
children
with
a
kind
of
contempt
as
being
only
fit
to
grow
up
to
be
the
servants
of
the
children
of
such
people
as
rushton
and
sweater
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
had
been
taught
when
they
were
children
in
the
schools
they
attended
then
they
were
taught
to
themselves
lowly
and
reverently
towards
their
betters
and
they
were
now
actually
sending
their
own
children
to
learn
the
same
degrading
lessons
in
their
turn
they
had
a
vast
amount
of
consideration
for
their
betters
and
for
the
children
of
their
betters
but
very
little
for
their
own
children
for
each
other
or
for
themselves
that
was
why
they
sat
there
in
their
rags
and
ate
their
coarse
food
and
cracked
their
coarser
jokes
and
drank
the
dreadful
tea
and
were
content
so
long
as
they
had
plenty
of
work
and
plenty
of
something
to
eat
and
somebody
else
clothes
to
wear
they
were
content
and
they
were
proud
of
it
they
gloried
in
it
they
agreed
and
assured
each
other
that
the
good
things
of
life
were
not
intended
for
the
of
them
or
their
children
become
of
the
professor
asked
the
gentleman
who
sat
on
the
upturned
pail
in
the
corner
referring
to
owen
who
had
not
yet
come
down
from
his
work
preparing
sermon
remarked
harlow
with
a
laugh
ai
no
lectures
from
lately
since
been
on
that
room
observed
easton
we
good
job
too
exclaimed
sawkins
gives
me
the
pip
to
the
same
old
thing
over
and
over
again
ole
frank
remarked
harlow
does
upset
about
things
do
fool
said
bundy
take
bloody
good
care
i
do
go
worryin
myself
to
death
like
doin
about
such
dam
rot
as
that
do
believe
that
wot
makes
look
so
bad
as
does
observed
harlow
times
this
morning
i
could
help
noticing
the
way
kept
on
coughing
thought
seemed
to
be
a
bit
better
lately
philpot
observed
cheerful
and
happier
like
and
more
inclined
for
a
bit
of
fun
a
funny
sort
of
chap
ai
he
said
bundy
day
quite
jolly
singing
and
cracking
jokes
and
tellin
yarns
and
the
next
you
ca
hardly
get
a
word
out
of
rot
i
call
it
chimed
in
the
man
on
the
pail
the
the
use
of
the
likes
of
us
troublin
our
about
politics
i
do
see
that
replied
harlow
got
votes
and
really
the
people
what
control
the
affairs
of
the
country
so
i
reckon
we
ought
to
take
some
interest
in
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
ca
see
no
sense
in
this
socialist
wangle
that
owen
always
about
nobody
else
neither
said
crass
with
a
jeering
laugh
if
all
the
bloody
money
in
the
world
was
divided
out
equal
said
the
man
on
the
pail
profoundly
would
do
no
good
in
six
months
time
it
would
be
all
back
in
the
same
again
course
said
everybody
a
cuff
the
other
day
about
money
bein
no
good
at
all
observed
easton
you
remember
said
as
money
was
the
principal
cause
of
poverty
it
is
the
principal
cause
of
poverty
said
owen
who
entered
at
that
moment
shouted
philpot
leading
off
a
cheer
which
the
others
took
up
professor
arrived
and
will
now
proceed
to
say
a
few
remarks
a
roar
of
merriment
greeted
this
sally
our
bloody
dinner
first
for
christ
sake
appealed
harlow
with
mock
despair
as
owen
having
filled
his
cup
with
tea
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
philpot
rose
solemnly
to
his
feet
and
looking
round
the
company
said
with
your
kind
permission
as
soon
as
the
professor
finished
dinner
will
deliver
lecture
entitled
money
the
principal
cause
of
being
up
proving
as
money
ai
no
good
to
nobody
at
the
hend
of
the
lecture
a
collection
will
be
took
up
to
provide
the
lecturer
with
a
little
encouragement
philpot
resumed
his
seat
amid
cheers
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
eating
some
of
the
men
began
to
make
remarks
about
the
lecture
but
owen
only
laughed
and
went
on
reading
the
piece
of
newspaper
that
his
dinner
had
been
wrapped
in
usually
most
of
the
men
went
out
for
a
walk
after
dinner
but
as
it
happened
to
be
raining
that
day
they
were
determined
if
possible
to
make
owen
fulfill
the
engagement
made
in
his
name
by
philpot
said
harlow
and
the
suggestion
was
at
once
acted
upon
howls
groans
and
catcalls
filled
the
air
mingled
with
cries
of
us
our
money
back
wreck
the
and
so
on
on
cried
philpot
putting
his
hand
on
owen
shoulder
that
money
is
the
cause
of
poverty
one
thing
to
say
it
and
another
to
prove
it
sneered
crass
who
was
anxious
for
an
opportunity
to
produce
the
obscurer
cutting
is
the
real
cause
of
poverty
said
owen
it
repeated
crass
is
the
cause
of
poverty
because
it
is
the
device
by
which
those
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
are
enabled
to
rob
the
workers
of
the
fruits
of
their
labours
it
said
crass
owen
slowly
folded
up
the
piece
of
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
right
he
replied
show
you
how
the
great
money
trick
is
worked
owen
opened
his
dinner
basket
and
took
from
it
two
slices
of
bread
but
as
these
were
not
sufficient
he
requested
that
anyone
who
had
some
bread
left
would
give
it
to
him
they
gave
him
several
pieces
which
he
placed
in
a
heap
on
a
clean
piece
of
paper
and
having
borrowed
the
pocket
knives
they
used
to
cut
and
eat
their
dinners
with
from
easton
harlow
and
philpot
he
addressed
them
as
follows
pieces
of
bread
represent
the
raw
materials
which
exist
naturally
in
and
on
the
earth
for
the
use
of
mankind
they
were
not
made
by
any
human
being
but
were
created
by
the
great
spirit
for
the
benefit
and
sustenance
of
all
the
same
as
were
the
air
and
the
light
of
the
sun
about
as
a
man
as
i
met
for
some
time
said
harlow
winking
at
the
others
mate
said
philpot
would
agree
to
that
much
it
as
clear
as
mud
continued
owen
am
a
capitalist
or
rather
i
represent
the
landlord
and
capitalist
class
that
is
to
say
all
these
raw
materials
belong
to
me
it
does
not
matter
for
our
present
argument
how
i
obtained
possession
of
them
or
whether
i
have
any
real
right
to
them
the
only
thing
that
matters
now
is
the
admitted
fact
that
all
the
raw
materials
which
are
necessary
for
the
production
of
the
necessaries
of
life
are
now
the
property
of
the
landlord
and
capitalist
class
i
am
that
class
all
these
raw
materials
belong
to
me
enough
agreed
philpot
you
three
represent
the
working
class
you
have
nothing
and
for
my
part
although
i
have
all
these
raw
materials
they
are
of
no
use
to
me
what
i
need
is
the
things
that
can
be
made
out
of
these
raw
materials
by
work
but
as
i
am
too
lazy
to
work
myself
i
have
invented
the
money
trick
to
make
you
work
for
me
but
first
i
must
explain
that
i
possess
something
else
beside
the
raw
materials
these
three
knives
represent
all
the
machinery
of
production
the
factories
tools
railways
and
so
forth
without
which
the
necessaries
of
life
can
not
be
produced
in
abundance
and
these
three
coins
taking
three
halfpennies
from
his
pocket
my
money
capital
before
we
go
any
further
said
owen
interrupting
himself
is
most
important
that
you
remember
that
i
am
not
supposed
to
be
merely
a
capitalist
i
represent
the
whole
capitalist
class
you
are
not
supposed
to
be
just
three
workers
you
represent
the
whole
working
class
right
all
right
said
crass
impatiently
all
understand
that
git
on
with
it
owen
proceeded
to
cut
up
one
of
the
slices
of
bread
into
a
number
of
little
square
blocks
represent
the
things
which
are
produced
by
labour
aided
by
machinery
from
the
raw
materials
we
will
suppose
that
three
of
these
blocks
represent
a
week
work
we
will
suppose
that
a
week
work
is
worth
one
pound
and
we
will
suppose
that
each
of
these
is
a
sovereign
we
be
able
to
do
the
trick
better
if
we
had
real
sovereigns
but
i
forgot
to
bring
any
with
me
lend
you
some
said
philpot
regretfully
i
left
me
purse
on
our
grand
pianner
as
by
a
strange
coincidence
nobody
happened
to
have
any
gold
with
them
it
was
decided
to
make
shift
with
the
halfpence
this
is
the
way
the
trick
works
you
goes
on
with
it
interrupted
philpot
apprehensively
you
think
we
better
someone
to
keep
watch
at
the
gate
in
case
a
slop
comes
along
we
do
want
to
get
runned
in
you
know
do
think
there
any
need
for
that
replied
owen
only
one
slop
who
interfere
with
us
for
playing
this
game
and
police
constable
socialism
mind
about
socialism
said
crass
irritably
along
with
the
bloody
trick
owen
now
addressed
himself
to
the
working
classes
as
represented
by
philpot
harlow
and
easton
say
that
you
are
all
in
need
of
employment
and
as
i
am
the
capitalist
class
i
am
going
to
invest
all
my
money
in
various
industries
so
as
to
give
you
plenty
of
work
i
shall
pay
each
of
you
one
pound
per
week
and
a
week
work
is
you
must
each
produce
three
of
these
square
blocks
for
doing
this
work
you
will
each
receive
your
wages
the
money
will
be
your
own
to
do
as
you
like
with
and
the
things
you
produce
will
of
course
be
mine
to
do
as
i
like
with
you
will
each
take
one
of
these
machines
and
as
soon
as
you
have
done
a
week
work
you
shall
have
your
money
the
working
classes
accordingly
set
to
work
and
the
capitalist
class
sat
down
and
watched
them
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
they
passed
the
nine
little
blocks
to
owen
who
placed
them
on
a
piece
of
paper
by
his
side
and
paid
the
workers
their
wages
blocks
represent
the
necessaries
of
life
you
ca
live
without
some
of
these
things
but
as
they
belong
to
me
you
will
have
to
buy
them
from
me
my
price
for
these
blocks
is
one
pound
each
as
the
working
classes
were
in
need
of
the
necessaries
of
life
and
as
they
could
not
eat
drink
or
wear
the
useless
money
they
were
compelled
to
agree
to
the
kind
capitalist
terms
they
each
bought
back
and
at
once
consumed
of
the
produce
of
their
labour
the
capitalist
class
also
devoured
two
of
the
square
blocks
and
so
the
net
result
of
the
week
work
was
that
the
kind
capitalist
had
consumed
two
pounds
worth
of
the
things
produced
by
the
labour
of
the
others
and
reckoning
the
squares
at
their
market
value
of
one
pound
each
he
had
more
than
doubled
his
capital
for
he
still
possessed
the
three
pounds
in
money
and
in
addition
four
pounds
worth
of
goods
as
for
the
working
classes
philpot
harlow
and
easton
having
each
consumed
the
pound
worth
of
necessaries
they
had
bought
with
their
wages
they
were
again
in
precisely
the
same
condition
as
when
they
started
work
they
had
nothing
this
process
was
repeated
several
times
for
each
week
work
the
producers
were
paid
their
wages
they
kept
on
working
and
spending
all
their
earnings
the
capitalist
consumed
twice
as
much
as
any
one
of
them
and
his
pile
of
wealth
continually
increased
in
a
little
while
reckoning
the
little
squares
at
their
market
value
of
one
pound
each
he
was
worth
about
one
hundred
pounds
and
the
working
classes
were
still
in
the
same
condition
as
when
they
began
and
were
still
tearing
into
their
work
as
if
their
lives
depended
upon
it
after
a
while
the
rest
of
the
crowd
began
to
laugh
and
their
merriment
increased
when
the
capitalist
just
after
having
sold
a
pound
worth
of
necessaries
to
each
of
his
workers
suddenly
took
their
tools
the
machinery
of
production
the
knives
away
from
them
and
informed
them
that
as
owing
to
over
production
all
his
were
glutted
with
the
necessaries
of
life
he
had
decided
to
close
down
the
works
and
wot
the
bloody
are
we
to
do
now
demanded
philpot
not
my
business
replied
the
capitalist
paid
you
your
wages
and
provided
you
with
plenty
of
work
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
no
more
work
for
you
to
do
at
present
come
round
again
in
a
few
months
time
and
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
what
about
the
necessaries
of
life
demanded
harlow
must
have
something
to
eat
course
you
must
replied
the
capitalist
affably
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
sell
you
some
we
ai
got
no
bloody
money
you
ca
expect
me
to
give
you
my
goods
for
nothing
you
did
work
for
me
for
nothing
you
know
i
paid
you
for
your
work
and
you
should
have
saved
something
you
should
have
been
thrifty
like
me
look
how
i
have
got
on
by
being
thrifty
the
unemployed
looked
blankly
at
each
other
but
the
rest
of
the
crowd
only
laughed
and
then
the
three
unemployed
began
to
abuse
the
capitalist
demanding
that
he
should
give
them
some
of
the
necessaries
of
life
that
he
had
piled
up
in
his
warehouses
or
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
produce
some
more
for
their
own
needs
and
even
threatened
to
take
some
of
the
things
by
force
if
he
did
not
comply
with
their
demands
but
the
capitalist
told
them
not
to
be
insolent
and
spoke
to
them
about
honesty
and
said
if
they
were
not
careful
he
would
have
their
faces
battered
in
for
them
by
the
police
or
if
necessary
he
would
call
out
the
military
and
have
them
shot
down
like
dogs
the
same
as
he
had
done
before
at
featherstone
and
belfast
course
continued
the
capitalist
it
were
not
for
foreign
competition
i
should
be
able
to
sell
these
things
that
you
have
made
and
then
i
should
be
able
to
give
you
plenty
of
work
again
but
until
i
have
sold
them
to
somebody
or
other
or
until
i
have
used
them
myself
you
will
have
to
remain
idle
this
takes
the
bloody
biskit
do
it
said
harlow
only
thing
as
i
can
see
for
it
said
philpot
mournfully
to
a
unemployed
procession
the
idear
said
harlow
and
the
three
began
to
march
about
the
room
in
indian
file
singing
got
no
work
to
we
got
no
work
to
just
because
we
been
workin
a
dam
sight
too
hard
now
we
got
no
work
to
do
as
they
marched
round
the
crowd
jeered
at
them
and
made
offensive
remarks
crass
said
that
anyone
could
see
that
they
were
a
lot
of
lazy
drunken
loafers
who
had
never
done
a
fair
day
work
in
their
lives
and
never
intended
to
sha
never
get
nothing
like
this
you
know
said
philpot
try
the
religious
dodge
right
agreed
harlow
shall
we
give
know
cried
philpot
after
a
moment
deliberation
let
my
lower
lights
be
burning
that
always
makes
part
up
the
three
unemployed
accordingly
resumed
their
march
round
the
room
singing
mournfully
and
imitating
the
usual
whine
of
your
lamp
me
some
poor
tempest
torst
strugglin
to
save
the
hin
the
may
be
lorst
so
let
try
lower
lights
be
burning
send
gleam
acrost
the
wave
some
poor
shipwrecked
struggling
seaman
you
may
rescue
you
may
save
frens
said
philpot
removing
his
cap
and
addressing
the
crowd
hall
honest
british
workin
men
but
we
been
hout
of
work
for
the
last
twenty
years
on
account
of
foreign
competition
and
we
do
come
hout
because
we
too
lazy
to
work
it
because
we
ca
get
a
job
if
it
was
for
foreign
competition
the
hinglish
capitalists
would
be
able
to
sell
their
goods
and
give
us
plenty
of
work
and
if
they
could
i
assure
you
that
we
should
hall
be
perfectly
willing
and
contented
to
go
on
our
bloody
guts
out
for
the
benefit
of
our
masters
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
quite
willin
to
work
that
hall
we
arst
for
plenty
of
work
but
as
we
ca
get
it
we
forced
to
come
out
and
arst
you
to
spare
a
few
coppers
towards
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
night
lodgin
as
philpot
held
out
his
cap
for
subscriptions
some
of
them
attempted
to
expectorate
into
it
but
the
more
charitable
put
in
pieces
of
cinder
or
dirt
from
the
floor
and
the
capitalist
was
so
affected
by
the
sight
of
their
misery
that
he
gave
them
one
of
the
sovereigns
he
had
in
us
pocket
but
as
this
was
of
no
use
to
them
they
immediately
returned
it
to
him
in
exchange
for
one
of
the
small
squares
of
the
necessaries
of
life
which
they
divided
and
greedily
devoured
and
when
they
had
finished
eating
they
gathered
round
the
philanthropist
and
sang
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
afterwards
harlow
suggested
that
they
should
ask
him
if
he
would
allow
them
to
elect
him
to
parliament
chapter
the
phrenologist
the
following
morning
saturday
the
men
went
about
their
work
in
gloomy
silence
there
were
but
few
attempts
at
conversation
and
no
jests
or
singing
the
tenor
of
the
impending
slaughter
pervaded
the
house
even
those
who
were
confident
of
being
spared
and
kept
on
till
the
job
was
finished
shared
the
general
depression
not
only
out
of
sympathy
for
the
doomed
but
because
they
knew
that
a
similar
fate
awaited
themselves
a
little
later
on
they
all
waited
anxiously
for
nimrod
to
come
but
hour
after
hour
dragged
slowly
by
and
he
did
not
arrive
at
half
past
eleven
some
of
those
who
had
made
up
their
minds
that
they
were
to
be
began
to
hope
that
the
slaughter
was
to
be
deferred
for
a
few
days
after
all
there
was
plenty
of
work
still
to
be
done
even
if
all
hands
were
kept
on
the
job
could
scarcely
be
finished
in
another
week
anyhow
it
would
not
be
very
long
now
before
they
would
know
one
way
or
the
other
if
he
did
not
come
before
twelve
it
was
all
right
all
the
hands
were
paid
by
the
hour
and
were
therefore
entitled
to
an
notice
easton
and
harlow
were
working
together
on
the
staircase
finishing
the
doors
and
other
woodwork
with
white
enamel
the
men
had
not
been
allowed
to
spend
the
time
necessary
to
prepare
this
work
in
a
proper
manner
it
had
not
been
rubbed
down
smooth
or
properly
filled
up
and
it
had
not
had
a
sufficient
number
of
coats
of
paint
to
make
it
solid
white
now
that
the
glossy
enamel
was
put
on
the
work
looked
rather
rough
and
shady
ai
all
right
ai
it
remarked
harlow
sarcastically
indicating
the
door
he
had
just
finished
easton
laughed
ca
understand
how
people
pass
such
work
he
said
sweater
did
make
some
remark
about
it
the
other
day
replied
harlow
i
heard
misery
tell
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
perfect
job
of
such
old
doors
believe
that
man
the
biggest
liar
gord
ever
made
said
easton
an
opinion
in
which
harlow
entirely
concurred
wonder
what
the
time
is
said
the
latter
after
a
pause
do
know
exactly
replied
easton
it
ca
be
far
off
twelve
do
seem
to
be
comin
does
harlow
continued
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
did
turn
up
at
all
now
do
mean
to
stop
nobody
today
after
all
they
spoke
in
hushed
tones
and
glanced
cautiously
about
them
fearful
of
being
heard
or
observed
is
a
bloody
life
ai
it
harlow
said
bitterly
our
guts
out
like
a
lot
of
slaves
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
and
then
as
soon
as
they
done
with
you
you
chucked
aside
like
a
dirty
rag
and
i
begin
to
think
that
a
great
deal
of
what
owen
says
is
true
but
for
my
part
i
ca
see
it
ever
goin
to
be
altered
can
you
blowed
if
i
know
mate
but
whether
it
can
be
altered
or
not
one
thing
very
certain
it
wo
be
done
in
our
time
neither
of
them
seemed
to
think
that
if
the
they
spoke
of
were
to
be
accomplished
at
all
they
themselves
would
have
to
help
to
bring
it
about
wonder
what
they
doin
about
the
venetian
blinds
said
easton
there
anyone
doin
em
yet
do
know
ai
nothing
about
since
the
boy
took
to
the
shop
there
was
quite
a
mystery
about
these
blinds
about
a
month
ago
they
were
taken
to
the
down
at
the
yard
to
be
repainted
and
and
since
then
nothing
had
been
heard
of
them
by
the
men
working
at
the
a
couple
of
us
will
be
sent
there
to
do
next
week
remarked
harlow
so
most
likely
they
to
be
done
in
a
bloody
at
the
last
minute
presently
harlow
who
was
very
anxious
to
know
what
time
it
was
went
downstairs
to
ask
slyme
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
from
the
window
of
the
room
where
slyme
was
papering
one
could
see
into
the
front
garden
harlow
paused
a
moment
to
watch
bundy
and
the
labourers
who
were
still
working
in
the
trenches
at
the
drains
and
as
he
looked
out
he
saw
hunter
approaching
the
house
harlow
drew
back
hastily
and
returned
to
his
work
and
as
he
went
he
passed
the
word
to
the
other
men
warning
them
of
the
approach
of
misery
hunter
entered
in
his
usual
manner
and
after
crawling
quietly
about
the
house
for
about
ten
minutes
he
went
into
the
drawing
room
see
you
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
at
last
he
said
replied
owen
only
got
this
bit
of
outlining
to
do
now
well
it
looks
very
nice
of
course
said
misery
in
a
voice
of
mourning
we
lost
money
over
it
it
taken
you
a
week
longer
to
do
than
we
allowed
for
you
said
three
weeks
and
it
taken
you
a
month
and
we
only
allowed
for
fifteen
books
of
gold
but
you
been
and
used
can
hardly
blame
me
for
that
you
know
answered
owen
could
have
got
it
done
in
the
three
weeks
but
mr
rushton
told
me
not
to
hurry
for
the
sake
of
a
day
or
two
because
he
wanted
a
good
job
he
said
he
would
rather
lose
a
little
over
it
than
spoil
it
and
as
for
the
extra
gold
that
was
also
his
order
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
whined
misery
i
very
glad
it
done
because
this
kind
of
work
do
pay
we
you
back
on
the
brush
on
monday
morning
we
want
to
get
outside
done
next
week
if
it
keeps
fine
the
alluded
to
by
nimrod
was
the
large
brush
used
in
ordinary
painting
misery
now
began
wandering
about
the
house
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
sometimes
standing
for
several
minutes
silently
watching
the
hands
as
they
worked
as
he
watched
them
the
men
became
nervous
and
awkward
each
one
dreading
that
he
might
be
one
of
those
who
were
to
be
paid
off
at
one
at
about
five
minutes
to
twelve
hunter
went
down
to
the
the
scullery
where
crass
was
mixing
some
colour
and
getting
ready
some
to
be
taken
to
the
yard
suppose
the
b
r
gone
to
ask
crass
which
of
us
is
the
least
use
whispered
harlow
to
easton
would
be
surprised
if
it
was
you
and
me
for
two
replied
the
latter
in
the
same
tone
ca
trust
crass
you
know
for
all
seems
so
friendly
to
our
faces
you
never
know
what
ses
behind
our
backs
may
be
sure
it
wo
be
sawkins
or
any
of
the
other
because
nimrod
wo
want
to
pay
us
sixpence
for
painting
guttering
and
rainpipes
when
they
can
do
it
near
enough
for
fourpence
and
fivepence
they
wo
be
able
to
do
the
sashes
though
will
they
do
know
so
much
about
that
replied
easton
seems
to
be
good
enough
for
hunter
out
ere
comes
said
harlow
and
they
both
relapsed
into
silence
and
busied
themselves
with
their
work
misery
stood
watching
them
for
some
time
without
speaking
and
then
went
out
of
the
house
they
crept
cautiously
to
the
window
of
a
room
that
overlooked
the
garden
and
peeping
furtively
out
they
saw
him
standing
on
the
brink
of
one
of
the
trenches
moodily
watching
bundy
and
his
mates
as
they
toiled
at
the
drains
then
to
their
surprise
and
relief
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
gate
they
just
caught
sight
of
one
of
the
wheels
of
his
bicycle
as
he
rode
away
the
slaughter
was
evidently
to
be
put
off
until
next
week
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
left
a
message
for
some
of
us
with
crass
suggested
easton
do
think
it
likely
but
it
just
possible
i
goin
down
to
ask
said
harlow
desperately
may
as
well
know
the
worst
at
once
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
information
that
hunter
had
decided
not
to
stop
anyone
that
day
because
he
wanted
to
get
the
outside
finished
during
the
next
week
if
possible
the
hands
received
this
intelligence
with
mixed
feelings
because
although
it
left
them
safe
for
the
present
it
meant
that
nearly
everybody
would
certainly
be
stopped
next
saturday
if
not
before
whereas
if
a
few
had
been
sacked
today
it
would
have
made
it
all
the
better
for
the
rest
still
this
aspect
of
the
business
did
not
greatly
interfere
with
the
relief
that
they
all
felt
at
knowing
that
the
immediate
danger
was
over
and
the
fact
that
it
was
saturday
also
served
to
revive
their
drooping
spirits
they
all
felt
pretty
certain
that
misery
would
return
no
more
that
day
and
presently
harlow
began
to
sing
the
old
favourite
for
the
night
is
coming
the
refrain
of
which
was
soon
taken
up
by
nearly
everyone
in
the
house
for
the
night
is
coming
work
in
the
morning
hours
work
for
the
night
is
coming
work
springing
flowers
while
the
dew
is
sparkling
work
in
the
noonday
sun
work
for
the
night
is
coming
when
man
work
is
done
when
this
hymn
was
finished
someone
else
imitating
the
whine
of
a
started
where
is
my
wandering
boy
tonight
and
then
harlow
who
by
some
strange
chance
had
a
penny
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
the
ringing
of
the
coin
being
greeted
with
shouts
of
you
kind
lady
from
several
of
the
singers
this
little
action
of
harlow
was
the
means
of
bringing
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
to
light
although
it
was
saturday
morning
several
of
the
others
had
pennies
or
and
at
the
conclusion
of
each
verse
they
all
followed
harlow
example
and
the
house
resounded
with
the
ringing
of
falling
coins
cries
of
you
kind
lady
you
sir
and
bless
you
mingled
with
shouts
of
laughter
wandering
boy
was
followed
by
a
choice
selection
of
choruses
of
songs
including
my
bluebell
honeysuckle
and
the
bee
got
and
church
parade
the
whole
being
tastefully
varied
and
interspersed
with
howls
shrieks
curses
catcalls
and
downward
explosions
of
flatulence
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
crass
came
upstairs
he
shouted
christ
sake
make
less
row
suppose
nimrod
was
to
come
back
he
ai
comin
any
more
today
said
harlow
recklessly
what
if
does
come
cried
easton
cares
for
we
never
know
and
for
that
matter
rushton
or
sweater
might
come
at
any
minit
with
this
crass
went
muttering
back
to
the
scullery
and
the
men
relapsed
into
their
usual
silence
at
ten
minutes
to
one
they
all
ceased
work
put
away
their
colours
and
locked
up
the
house
there
were
a
number
of
to
be
taken
away
and
left
at
the
yard
on
their
way
to
the
office
these
crass
divided
amongst
the
others
carrying
nothing
himself
and
then
they
all
set
out
for
the
office
to
get
their
money
cracking
jokes
as
they
went
along
harlow
and
easton
enlivened
the
journey
by
coughing
significantly
whenever
they
met
a
young
woman
and
audibly
making
some
complimentary
remark
about
her
personal
appearance
if
the
girl
smiled
each
of
them
eagerly
claimed
to
have
her
first
but
if
she
appeared
offended
or
up
they
suggested
that
she
was
or
that
she
had
been
eating
vinegar
with
a
fork
now
and
then
they
kissed
their
hands
affectionately
to
whom
they
saw
looking
out
of
windows
some
of
these
girls
laughed
others
looked
indignant
but
whichever
way
they
took
it
was
equally
amusing
to
crass
and
the
rest
who
were
like
a
crowd
of
boys
just
let
out
of
school
it
will
be
remembered
that
there
was
a
back
door
to
rushton
office
in
this
door
was
a
small
sliding
panel
or
with
a
little
shelf
at
the
bottom
the
men
stood
in
the
road
on
the
pavement
outside
the
closed
door
their
money
being
passed
out
to
them
through
the
sliding
panel
as
there
was
no
shelter
when
it
rained
they
occasionally
got
wet
through
while
waiting
to
be
paid
with
some
firms
it
is
customary
to
call
out
the
names
of
the
men
and
pay
them
in
order
of
seniority
or
ability
but
there
was
no
such
system
here
the
man
who
got
to
the
aperture
first
was
paid
first
and
so
on
the
result
was
that
there
was
always
a
sort
of
miniature
of
life
the
men
pushing
and
struggling
against
each
other
as
if
their
lives
depended
upon
their
being
paid
by
a
certain
time
on
the
ledge
of
the
little
window
through
which
their
money
was
passed
there
was
always
a
hospital
every
man
put
either
a
penny
or
twopence
into
this
box
of
course
it
was
not
compulsory
to
do
so
but
they
all
did
because
they
felt
that
any
man
who
omitted
to
contribute
might
be
they
did
not
all
agree
with
contributing
to
the
hospital
for
several
reasons
they
knew
that
the
doctors
at
the
hospital
made
a
practice
of
using
the
free
patients
to
make
experiments
upon
and
they
also
knew
that
the
patients
who
contribute
so
very
largely
directly
to
the
maintenance
of
such
institutions
get
scant
consideration
when
they
apply
for
the
treatment
and
are
plainly
given
to
understand
that
they
are
receiving
some
of
the
men
thought
that
considering
the
extent
to
which
they
contributed
they
should
be
entitled
to
attention
as
a
right
after
receiving
their
wages
crass
easton
bundy
philpot
harlow
and
a
few
others
adjourned
to
the
cricketers
for
a
drink
owen
went
away
alone
and
slyme
also
went
on
by
himself
there
was
no
use
waiting
for
easton
to
come
out
of
the
public
house
because
there
was
no
knowing
how
long
he
would
be
he
might
stay
half
an
hour
or
two
hours
on
his
way
home
in
accordance
with
his
usual
custom
slyme
called
at
the
post
office
to
put
some
of
his
wages
in
the
bank
like
most
other
he
believed
in
taking
thought
for
the
morrow
what
he
should
eat
and
drink
and
wherewithal
he
was
to
be
clothed
he
thought
it
wise
to
layup
for
himself
as
much
treasure
upon
earth
as
possible
the
fact
that
jesus
said
that
his
disciples
were
not
to
do
these
things
made
no
more
difference
to
slyme
conduct
than
it
does
to
the
conduct
of
any
other
they
are
all
agreed
that
when
jesus
said
this
he
meant
something
else
and
all
the
other
inconvenient
things
that
jesus
said
are
disposed
of
in
the
same
way
for
instance
these
assure
us
that
when
jesus
said
not
evil
a
man
smite
thee
upon
he
right
cheek
turn
unto
him
also
the
left
he
really
meant
on
to
him
a
maxim
gun
disembowel
him
with
a
bayonet
or
batter
in
his
skull
with
the
butt
end
of
a
rifle
when
he
said
one
take
thy
coat
give
him
thy
cloak
also
the
say
that
what
he
really
meant
was
one
take
thy
coat
give
him
six
months
hard
labour
a
few
of
the
followers
of
jesus
admit
that
he
really
did
mean
just
what
he
said
but
they
say
that
the
world
would
never
be
able
to
go
on
if
they
followed
out
his
teachings
that
is
true
it
is
probably
the
effect
that
jesus
intended
his
teachings
to
produce
it
is
altogether
improbable
that
he
wished
the
world
to
continue
along
its
present
lines
but
if
these
pretended
followers
really
think
as
they
say
that
they
do
that
the
teachings
of
jesus
are
ridiculous
and
impracticable
why
continue
the
hypocritical
farce
of
calling
themselves
when
they
do
really
believe
in
or
follow
him
at
all
as
jesus
himself
pointed
out
there
no
sense
in
calling
him
lord
when
they
do
not
the
things
that
he
said
this
banking
transaction
finished
slyme
resumed
his
homeward
way
stopping
only
to
purchase
some
sweets
at
a
confectioner
he
spent
a
whole
sixpence
at
once
in
this
shop
on
a
glass
jar
of
sweets
for
the
baby
ruth
was
not
surprised
when
she
saw
him
come
in
alone
it
was
the
usual
thing
since
easton
had
become
so
friendly
with
crass
she
made
no
reference
to
his
absence
but
slyme
noticed
with
secret
chagrin
that
she
was
annoyed
and
disappointed
she
was
just
finishing
scrubbing
the
kitchen
floor
and
little
freddie
was
sitting
up
in
a
baby
high
chair
that
had
a
little
shelf
or
table
fixed
in
front
of
it
to
keep
him
amused
while
she
did
her
work
ruth
had
given
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
raspberry
jam
which
the
child
had
rubbed
all
over
his
face
and
into
his
scalp
evidently
being
under
the
impression
that
it
was
something
for
the
improvement
of
the
complexion
or
a
cure
for
baldness
he
now
looked
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
fight
or
a
railway
accident
the
child
hailed
the
arrival
of
slyme
with
enthusiasm
being
so
overcome
with
emotion
that
he
began
to
shed
tears
and
was
only
pacified
when
the
man
gave
him
the
jar
of
sweets
and
took
him
out
of
the
chair
slyme
presence
in
the
house
had
not
proved
so
irksome
as
easton
and
ruth
had
dreaded
it
would
be
indeed
at
first
he
made
a
point
of
retiring
to
his
own
room
after
tea
every
evening
until
they
invited
him
to
stay
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
nearly
every
wednesday
and
saturday
he
went
to
a
meeting
or
an
preaching
when
the
weather
permitted
for
he
was
one
of
a
little
zealous
band
of
people
connected
with
the
shining
light
chapel
who
carried
on
the
work
all
the
year
round
after
a
while
the
eastons
not
only
became
reconciled
to
his
presence
in
the
house
but
were
even
glad
of
it
ruth
especially
would
often
have
been
very
lonely
if
he
had
not
been
there
for
it
had
lately
become
easton
custom
to
spend
a
few
evenings
every
week
with
crass
at
the
cricketers
when
at
home
slyme
passed
his
time
playing
a
mandolin
or
making
fretwork
photo
frames
ruth
had
the
baby
photograph
taken
a
few
weeks
after
slyme
came
and
the
frame
he
made
for
it
was
now
one
of
the
ornaments
of
the
the
instinctive
unreasoning
aversion
she
had
at
first
felt
for
him
had
passed
away
in
a
quiet
unobtrusive
manner
he
did
her
so
many
little
services
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
dislike
him
at
first
she
used
to
address
him
as
but
after
a
time
she
fell
naturally
into
easton
practice
of
calling
him
by
his
first
name
as
for
the
baby
he
made
no
secret
of
his
affection
for
the
lodger
who
nursed
and
played
with
him
for
hours
at
a
stretch
serve
your
dinner
now
alf
said
ruth
when
she
had
finished
scrubbing
the
floor
i
wait
for
mine
for
a
little
while
will
may
come
in
no
hurry
replied
slyme
go
and
have
a
wash
he
may
be
here
then
as
he
spoke
slyme
who
had
been
sitting
by
the
fire
nursing
the
baby
who
was
trying
to
swallow
the
jar
of
sweets
put
the
child
back
into
the
high
chair
giving
him
one
of
the
sticks
of
sweet
out
of
the
jar
to
keep
him
quiet
and
went
upstairs
to
his
own
room
he
came
down
again
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
ruth
proceeded
to
serve
his
dinner
for
easton
was
still
absent
i
was
you
i
would
wait
for
will
said
slyme
may
not
come
for
another
hour
or
two
it
after
two
now
and
i
sure
you
must
be
hungry
suppose
i
may
as
well
replied
ruth
hesitatingly
most
likely
get
some
bread
and
cheese
at
the
cricketers
same
as
he
did
last
saturday
sure
to
responded
slyme
the
baby
had
had
his
face
washed
while
slyme
was
upstairs
directly
he
saw
his
mother
eating
he
threw
away
the
and
began
to
cry
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
she
had
to
take
him
on
her
lap
whilst
she
ate
her
dinner
and
feed
him
with
pieces
from
her
plate
slyme
talked
all
the
time
principally
about
the
child
he
was
very
fond
of
children
he
said
and
always
got
on
well
with
them
but
he
had
really
never
known
such
an
intelligent
child
for
his
age
as
freddie
his
would
have
been
astonished
had
they
been
present
to
hear
him
talking
about
the
shape
of
the
baby
head
they
would
have
been
astonished
at
the
amount
of
knowledge
he
appeared
to
possess
of
the
science
of
phrenology
ruth
at
any
rate
thought
he
was
very
clever
after
a
time
the
child
began
to
grow
fretful
and
refused
to
eat
when
his
mother
gave
him
a
fresh
piece
of
out
of
the
jar
he
threw
it
peevishly
on
the
floor
and
began
to
whimper
rubbing
his
face
against
his
mother
bosom
and
pulling
at
her
dress
with
his
hands
when
slyme
first
came
ruth
had
made
a
practice
of
withdrawing
from
the
room
if
he
happened
to
be
present
when
she
wanted
to
nurse
the
child
but
lately
she
had
been
less
sensitive
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
window
and
she
partly
covered
the
baby
face
with
a
light
shawl
that
she
wore
by
the
time
they
finished
dinner
the
child
had
dozed
off
to
sleep
slyme
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
down
at
them
presently
he
spoke
referring
of
course
to
the
baby
very
like
you
is
he
replied
ruth
says
he
takes
after
me
slyme
moved
a
little
closer
bending
down
to
look
at
the
slumbering
infant
know
at
first
i
thought
he
was
a
girl
he
continued
after
a
pause
seems
almost
too
pretty
for
a
boy
does
he
ruth
smiled
always
take
him
for
a
girl
at
first
she
said
i
took
him
with
me
to
the
monopole
stores
to
buy
some
things
and
the
manager
would
hardly
believe
it
was
a
girl
the
man
reached
out
his
hand
and
stroked
the
baby
face
although
slyme
behaviour
had
hitherto
always
been
very
correct
yet
there
was
occasionally
an
indefinable
something
in
his
manner
when
they
were
alone
that
made
ruth
feel
conscious
and
embarrassed
now
as
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
saw
the
expression
on
his
face
she
crimsoned
with
confusion
and
hastily
lowered
her
eyes
without
replying
to
his
last
remark
he
did
not
speak
again
either
and
they
remained
for
several
minutes
in
silence
as
if
spellbound
ruth
oppressed
with
instinctive
dread
and
slyme
scarcely
less
agitated
his
face
flushed
and
his
heart
beating
wildly
he
trembled
as
he
stood
over
her
hesitating
and
afraid
and
then
the
silence
was
suddenly
broken
by
the
creaking
and
clanging
of
the
front
gate
heralding
the
tardy
coming
of
easton
slyme
went
out
into
the
scullery
and
taking
down
the
blacking
brushes
from
the
shelf
began
cleaning
his
boots
it
was
plain
from
easton
appearance
and
manner
that
he
had
been
drinking
but
ruth
did
not
reproach
him
in
any
way
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
almost
feverishly
anxious
to
attend
to
his
comfort
when
slyme
finished
cleaning
his
boots
he
went
upstairs
to
his
room
receiving
a
careless
greeting
from
easton
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
he
felt
nervous
and
apprehensive
that
ruth
might
say
something
to
easton
and
was
not
quite
able
to
reassure
himself
with
the
reflection
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
to
tell
as
for
ruth
she
had
to
postpone
the
execution
of
her
hastily
formed
resolution
to
tell
her
husband
of
slyme
strange
behaviour
for
easton
fell
asleep
in
his
chair
before
he
had
finished
his
dinner
and
she
had
some
difficulty
in
waking
him
sufficiently
to
persuade
him
to
go
upstairs
to
bed
where
he
remained
until
probably
he
would
not
have
come
down
even
then
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
he
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
crass
at
the
cricketers
whilst
easton
was
asleep
slyme
had
been
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
making
a
fretwork
frame
he
played
with
freddie
while
ruth
prepared
the
tea
and
he
appeared
to
her
to
be
so
unconscious
of
having
done
anything
unusual
that
she
began
to
think
that
she
must
have
been
mistaken
in
imagining
that
he
had
intended
anything
wrong
after
tea
slyme
put
on
his
best
clothes
to
go
to
his
usual
meeting
as
a
rule
easton
and
ruth
went
out
marketing
together
every
saturday
night
but
this
evening
he
could
not
wait
for
her
because
he
had
promised
to
meet
crass
at
seven
so
he
arranged
to
see
her
down
town
at
eight
chapter
the
during
the
last
few
weeks
ever
since
he
had
been
engaged
on
the
decoration
of
the
owen
had
been
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
had
no
time
for
other
things
of
course
all
he
was
paid
for
was
the
time
he
actually
worked
but
really
every
waking
moment
of
his
time
was
given
to
the
task
now
that
it
was
finished
he
felt
something
like
one
aroused
from
a
dream
to
the
stern
realities
and
terrors
of
life
by
the
end
of
next
week
the
inside
of
the
house
and
part
of
the
outside
would
be
finished
and
as
far
as
he
knew
the
firm
had
nothing
else
to
do
at
present
most
of
the
other
employers
in
the
town
were
in
the
same
plight
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
apply
even
to
such
of
them
as
had
something
to
do
for
they
were
not
likely
to
take
on
a
fresh
man
while
some
of
their
regular
hands
were
idle
for
the
last
month
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
ill
he
had
forgotten
that
when
the
work
at
cave
was
finished
he
would
have
to
stand
off
with
the
rest
of
the
hands
in
brief
he
had
forgotten
for
the
time
being
that
like
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
he
was
on
the
brink
of
destitution
and
that
a
few
weeks
of
unemployment
or
idleness
meant
starvation
as
far
as
illness
was
concerned
he
was
even
worse
off
than
most
others
for
the
greater
number
of
them
were
members
of
some
sick
benefit
club
but
owen
rendered
him
ineligible
for
membership
of
such
societies
as
he
walked
homewards
after
being
paid
feeling
unutterably
depressed
and
weary
he
began
once
more
to
think
of
the
future
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
dreadful
it
appeared
even
looking
at
it
in
the
best
possible
light
supposing
he
did
not
fall
too
ill
to
work
or
lose
his
employment
from
some
other
cause
what
was
there
to
live
for
he
had
been
working
all
this
week
these
few
coins
that
he
held
in
his
hand
were
the
result
and
he
laughed
bitterly
as
he
thought
of
all
they
had
to
try
to
do
with
this
money
and
of
all
that
would
have
to
be
left
undone
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
kerk
street
he
saw
frankie
coming
to
meet
him
and
the
boy
catching
sight
of
him
at
the
same
moment
began
running
and
leapt
into
his
arms
with
a
joyous
whoop
told
me
to
tell
you
to
buy
something
for
dinner
before
you
come
home
because
there
nothing
in
the
house
she
tell
you
what
i
was
to
get
she
did
tell
me
something
but
i
forget
what
it
was
but
i
know
she
said
to
get
anything
you
like
if
you
could
get
what
she
told
me
to
tell
you
we
go
and
see
what
we
can
find
said
owen
i
were
you
i
get
a
tin
of
salmon
or
some
eggs
and
bacon
suggested
frankie
as
he
skipped
along
holding
his
father
hand
do
want
anything
that
a
lot
of
trouble
to
cook
you
know
because
mum
not
very
well
today
she
up
she
been
up
all
the
morning
but
she
lying
down
now
we
done
all
the
work
though
while
she
was
making
the
beds
i
started
washing
up
the
cups
and
saucers
without
telling
her
but
when
she
came
in
and
saw
what
a
mess
i
made
on
the
floor
she
had
to
stop
me
doing
it
and
she
had
to
change
nearly
all
my
clothes
as
well
because
i
was
almost
wet
through
but
i
managed
the
wiping
up
all
right
when
she
did
the
washing
and
i
swept
the
passage
and
put
all
my
things
tidy
and
made
the
cat
bed
and
that
just
reminds
me
will
you
please
give
me
my
penny
now
i
promised
the
cat
that
i
bring
him
back
some
meat
owen
complied
with
the
boy
request
and
while
the
latter
went
to
the
butcher
for
the
meat
owen
went
into
the
grocer
to
get
something
for
dinner
it
being
arranged
that
they
were
to
meet
again
at
the
corner
of
the
street
owen
was
at
the
appointed
place
first
and
after
waiting
some
time
and
seeing
no
sign
of
the
boy
he
decided
to
go
towards
the
butcher
to
meet
him
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
shop
he
saw
the
boy
standing
outside
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
butcher
a
stoutly
built
man
with
a
very
red
face
owen
perceived
at
once
that
the
child
was
trying
to
explain
something
because
frankie
had
a
habit
of
holding
his
head
sideways
and
supplementing
his
speech
by
spreading
out
his
fingers
and
making
quaint
gestures
with
his
hands
whenever
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
himself
understood
the
boy
was
doing
this
now
waving
one
hand
about
with
the
fingers
and
thumb
extended
wide
and
with
the
other
flourishing
a
paper
parcel
which
evidently
contained
the
pieces
of
meat
presently
the
man
laughed
heartily
and
after
shaking
hands
with
frankie
went
into
the
shop
to
attend
to
a
customer
and
frankie
rejoined
his
father
butcher
a
very
decent
sort
of
chap
you
know
dad
he
said
would
take
a
penny
for
the
meat
that
what
you
were
talking
to
him
about
no
we
were
talking
about
socialism
you
see
this
is
the
second
time
he
would
take
the
money
and
the
first
time
he
did
it
i
thought
he
must
be
a
socialist
but
i
did
ask
him
then
but
when
he
did
it
again
this
time
i
asked
him
if
he
was
so
he
said
no
he
said
he
was
quite
mad
yet
so
i
said
if
you
think
that
socialists
are
all
mad
you
very
much
mistaken
because
i
a
socialist
myself
and
quite
sure
i
not
mad
so
he
said
he
knew
i
was
all
right
but
he
did
understand
anything
about
socialism
himself
only
that
it
meant
sharing
out
all
the
money
so
that
everyone
could
have
the
same
so
then
i
told
him
that
not
socialism
at
all
and
when
i
explained
it
to
him
properly
and
advised
him
to
be
one
he
said
he
think
about
it
so
i
said
if
he
only
do
that
he
be
sure
to
change
over
to
our
side
and
then
he
laughed
and
promised
to
let
me
know
next
time
he
sees
me
and
i
promised
to
lend
him
some
literature
you
wo
mind
will
you
dad
course
not
when
we
get
home
we
have
a
look
through
what
got
and
you
can
take
him
some
of
them
know
cried
frankie
eagerly
two
very
best
of
all
happy
britain
and
england
for
the
english
he
knew
that
these
were
of
the
best
because
he
had
often
heard
his
father
and
mother
say
so
and
he
had
noticed
that
whenever
a
socialist
friend
came
to
visit
them
he
was
also
of
the
same
opinion
as
a
rule
on
saturday
evenings
they
all
three
went
out
together
to
do
the
marketing
but
on
this
occasion
in
consequence
of
nora
being
unwell
owen
and
frankie
went
by
themselves
the
frequent
recurrence
of
his
wife
illness
served
to
increase
owen
pessimism
with
regard
to
the
future
and
the
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
procure
for
her
the
comforts
she
needed
was
not
calculated
to
dispel
the
depression
that
filled
his
mind
as
he
reflected
that
there
was
no
hope
of
better
times
in
the
majority
of
cases
for
a
workman
there
is
no
hope
of
advancement
after
he
has
learnt
his
trade
and
become
a
all
progress
ceases
he
is
at
the
goal
after
he
has
been
working
ten
or
twenty
years
he
commands
no
more
than
he
did
at
first
a
bare
living
wage
sufficient
money
to
purchase
fuel
to
keep
the
human
machine
working
as
he
grows
older
he
will
have
to
be
content
with
even
less
and
all
the
time
he
holds
his
employment
at
the
caprice
and
by
the
favour
of
his
masters
who
regard
him
merely
as
a
piece
of
mechanism
that
enables
them
to
accumulate
money
a
thing
which
they
are
justified
in
casting
aside
as
soon
as
it
becomes
unprofitable
and
the
workman
must
not
only
be
an
efficient
machine
but
he
must
also
be
the
servile
subject
of
his
masters
if
he
is
not
abjectly
civil
and
humble
if
he
will
not
submit
tamely
to
insult
indignity
and
every
form
of
contemptuous
treatment
that
occasion
makes
possible
he
can
be
dismissed
and
replaced
in
a
moment
by
one
of
the
crowd
of
unemployed
who
are
always
waiting
for
his
job
this
is
the
status
of
the
majority
of
the
of
all
the
ages
under
the
present
system
as
he
walked
through
the
crowded
streets
holding
frankie
by
the
hand
owen
thought
that
to
voluntarily
continue
to
live
such
a
life
as
this
betokened
a
degraded
mind
to
allow
one
child
to
grow
up
to
suffer
it
in
turn
was
an
act
of
callous
criminal
cruelty
in
this
matter
he
held
different
opinions
from
most
of
his
fellow
workmen
the
greater
number
of
them
were
quite
willing
and
content
that
their
children
should
be
made
into
beasts
of
burden
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
little
frail
figure
trotting
along
by
his
side
owen
thought
for
the
thousandth
time
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
child
to
die
now
he
would
never
be
fit
to
be
a
soldier
in
the
ferocious
christian
battle
of
life
then
he
remembered
nora
although
she
was
always
brave
and
never
complained
he
knew
that
her
life
was
one
of
almost
incessant
physical
suffering
and
as
for
himself
he
was
tired
and
sick
of
it
all
he
had
been
working
like
a
slave
all
his
life
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
for
it
there
never
would
be
anything
to
show
for
it
he
thought
of
the
man
who
had
killed
his
wife
and
children
the
jury
had
returned
the
usual
verdict
insanity
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
these
people
that
the
truth
was
that
to
continue
to
suffer
hopelessly
like
this
was
evidence
of
permanent
insanity
but
supposing
that
bodily
death
was
not
the
end
suppose
there
was
some
kind
of
a
god
if
there
were
it
was
unreasonable
to
think
that
the
being
who
was
capable
of
creating
such
a
world
as
this
and
who
seemed
so
callously
indifferent
to
the
unhappiness
of
his
creatures
would
also
be
capable
of
devising
and
creating
the
other
hell
that
most
people
believed
in
although
it
was
december
the
evening
was
mild
and
clear
the
full
moon
deluged
the
town
with
silvery
light
and
the
cloudless
sky
was
jewelled
with
myriads
of
glittering
stars
looking
out
into
the
unfathomable
infinity
of
space
owen
wondered
what
manner
of
being
or
power
it
was
that
had
originated
and
sustained
all
this
considered
as
an
explanation
of
the
existence
of
the
universe
the
orthodox
christian
religion
was
too
absurd
to
merit
a
second
thought
but
then
every
other
conceivable
hypothesis
was
also
ultimately
unsatisfactory
and
even
ridiculous
to
believe
that
the
universe
as
it
is
now
has
existed
from
all
eternity
without
any
cause
is
surely
ridiculous
but
to
say
that
it
was
created
by
a
being
who
existed
without
a
cause
from
all
eternity
is
equally
ridiculous
in
fact
it
was
only
postponing
the
difficulty
one
stage
evolution
was
not
more
satisfactory
because
although
it
was
undoubtedly
true
as
far
as
it
went
it
only
went
part
of
the
way
leaving
the
great
question
still
unanswered
by
assuming
the
existence
in
the
beginning
of
the
elements
of
matter
without
a
cause
the
question
remained
unanswered
because
it
was
unanswerable
regarding
this
problem
man
was
but
infant
crying
in
the
night
an
infant
crying
for
the
light
and
with
no
language
but
a
cry
all
the
same
it
did
not
follow
because
one
could
not
explain
the
mystery
oneself
that
it
was
right
to
try
to
believe
an
unreasonable
explanation
offered
by
someone
else
but
although
he
reasoned
like
this
owen
could
not
help
longing
for
something
to
believe
for
some
hope
for
the
future
something
to
compensate
for
the
unhappiness
of
the
present
in
one
sense
he
thought
how
good
it
would
be
if
christianity
were
true
and
after
all
the
sorrow
there
was
to
be
an
eternity
of
happiness
such
as
it
had
never
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
conceive
if
only
that
were
true
nothing
else
would
matter
how
contemptible
and
insignificant
the
very
worst
that
could
happen
here
would
be
if
one
knew
that
this
life
was
only
a
short
journey
that
was
to
terminate
at
the
beginning
of
an
eternity
of
joy
but
no
one
really
believed
this
and
as
for
those
who
pretended
to
do
so
their
lives
showed
that
they
did
not
believe
it
at
all
their
greed
and
inhumanity
their
ferocious
determination
to
secure
for
themselves
the
good
things
of
this
world
were
conclusive
proofs
of
their
hypocrisy
and
infidelity
said
frankie
suddenly
go
over
and
hear
what
that
saying
he
pointed
across
the
way
to
where
a
little
distance
back
from
the
main
road
just
round
the
corner
of
a
side
street
a
group
of
people
were
standing
encircling
a
large
lantern
fixed
on
the
top
of
a
pole
about
seven
feet
high
which
was
being
held
by
one
of
the
men
a
bright
light
was
burning
inside
this
lantern
and
on
the
pane
of
white
obscured
glass
which
formed
the
sides
visible
from
where
owen
and
frankie
were
standing
was
written
in
bold
plain
letters
that
were
readable
even
at
that
distance
the
text
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
the
man
whose
voice
had
attracted
frankie
attention
was
reading
out
a
verse
of
a
hymn
heard
the
voice
of
jesus
say
behold
i
freely
give
the
living
water
thirsty
one
stoop
down
and
drink
and
live
i
came
to
jesus
and
i
drank
of
that
life
giving
stream
my
thirst
was
quenched
my
soul
revived
and
now
i
live
in
him
the
individual
who
gave
out
this
hymn
was
a
tall
thin
man
whose
clothes
hung
loosely
on
the
angles
of
his
bony
form
his
long
thin
legs
about
which
the
baggy
trousers
hung
in
ungraceful
folds
were
slightly
and
terminated
in
large
flat
feet
his
arms
were
very
long
even
for
such
a
tall
man
and
the
huge
bony
hands
were
gnarled
and
knotted
regardless
of
the
season
he
had
removed
his
bowler
hat
revealing
his
forehead
which
was
high
flat
and
narrow
his
nose
was
a
large
fleshy
hawklike
beak
and
from
the
side
of
each
nostril
a
deep
indentation
extended
downwards
until
it
disappeared
in
the
drooping
moustache
that
concealed
his
mouth
when
he
was
not
speaking
but
the
vast
extent
of
which
was
perceptible
now
as
he
opened
it
to
call
out
the
words
of
the
hymn
his
chin
was
large
and
extraordinarily
long
the
eyes
were
pale
blue
very
small
and
close
together
surmounted
by
spare
almost
invisible
eyebrows
with
a
deep
vertical
cleft
between
them
over
the
nose
his
head
covered
with
thick
coarse
brown
hair
was
very
large
especially
at
the
back
the
ears
were
small
and
laid
close
to
the
head
if
one
were
to
make
a
drawing
of
his
cadaverous
visage
it
would
be
found
that
the
outline
resembled
that
of
the
lid
of
a
coffin
as
owen
and
frankie
drew
near
the
boy
tugged
at
his
father
hand
and
whispered
that
the
teacher
at
the
sunday
school
where
i
went
that
day
with
charley
and
elsie
owen
looked
quickly
and
saw
that
it
was
hunter
as
hunter
ceased
reading
out
the
words
of
the
hymn
the
little
company
of
evangelists
began
to
sing
accompanied
by
the
strains
of
a
small
but
peculiarly
organ
a
few
persons
in
the
crowd
joined
in
the
words
being
familiar
to
them
during
the
singing
their
faces
were
a
study
they
all
looked
so
profoundly
solemn
and
miserable
as
if
they
were
a
gang
of
condemned
criminals
waiting
to
be
led
forth
to
execution
the
great
number
of
the
people
standing
around
appeared
to
be
listening
more
out
of
idle
curiosity
than
anything
else
and
two
young
men
evidently
strangers
and
visitors
to
the
town
amused
themselves
by
making
audible
remarks
about
the
texts
on
the
lantern
there
was
also
a
shabbily
dressed
man
in
a
battered
bowler
hat
who
stood
on
the
inner
edge
of
the
crowd
almost
in
the
ring
itself
with
folded
arms
and
an
expression
of
scorn
he
had
a
very
thin
pale
face
with
a
large
nose
and
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
first
duke
of
wellington
as
the
singing
proceeded
the
scornful
expression
faded
from
the
visage
of
the
and
he
not
only
joined
in
but
unfolded
his
arms
and
began
waving
them
about
as
if
he
were
conducting
the
music
by
the
time
the
singing
was
over
a
considerable
crowd
had
gathered
and
then
one
of
the
evangelists
the
same
man
who
had
given
out
the
hymn
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
ring
he
had
evidently
been
offended
by
the
unseemly
conduct
of
the
two
young
men
for
after
a
preliminary
glance
round
upon
the
crowd
he
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
pair
and
immediately
launched
out
upon
a
long
tirade
against
what
he
called
then
having
heartily
denounced
all
those
who
as
he
put
it
to
believe
he
proceeded
to
ridicule
those
believers
who
while
professing
to
believe
the
bible
rejected
the
doctrine
of
hell
that
the
existence
of
a
place
of
eternal
torture
is
taught
in
the
bible
he
tried
to
prove
by
a
long
succession
of
texts
as
he
proceeded
he
became
very
excited
and
the
contemptuous
laughter
of
the
two
unbelievers
seemed
to
make
him
worse
he
shouted
and
raved
literally
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
glaring
in
a
frenzied
manner
around
upon
the
faces
of
the
crowd
is
a
hell
he
shouted
understand
this
clearly
the
wicked
shall
be
turned
into
hell
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
then
you
stand
a
very
good
chance
of
being
damned
also
exclaimed
one
of
the
two
young
men
do
you
make
it
out
demanded
the
preacher
wiping
the
froth
from
his
lips
and
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
because
you
do
believe
the
bible
yourselves
nimrod
and
the
other
evangelists
laughed
and
looked
pityingly
at
the
young
man
my
dear
brother
said
misery
your
delusion
i
thank
god
i
do
believe
it
every
word
fervently
ejaculated
slyme
and
several
of
the
other
disciples
no
you
do
replied
the
other
i
can
prove
you
do
it
then
said
nimrod
out
the
and
verses
of
the
xvith
chapter
of
mark
said
the
disturber
of
the
meeting
the
crowd
began
to
close
in
on
the
centre
the
better
to
hear
the
dispute
misery
standing
close
to
the
lantern
found
the
verse
mentioned
and
read
aloud
as
follows
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
you
ca
heal
the
sick
neither
can
you
speak
new
languages
or
cast
out
devils
but
perhaps
you
can
drink
deadly
things
without
suffering
harm
the
speaker
here
suddenly
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
glass
bottle
and
held
it
out
towards
misery
who
shrank
from
it
with
horror
as
he
continued
have
here
a
most
deadly
poison
there
is
in
this
bottle
sufficient
strychnine
to
kill
a
dozen
unbelievers
drink
it
and
if
it
does
harm
you
we
know
that
you
really
are
a
believer
and
that
what
you
believe
is
the
truth
said
the
who
had
listened
to
the
progress
of
the
argument
with
great
interest
that
fair
enough
git
it
acrost
yer
chest
some
of
the
people
in
the
crowd
began
to
laugh
and
voices
were
heard
from
several
quarters
calling
upon
misery
to
drink
the
strychnine
if
you
allow
me
i
explain
to
you
what
that
there
verse
means
said
hunter
you
read
it
carefully
with
the
context
do
want
you
to
tell
me
what
it
means
interrupted
the
other
am
able
to
read
for
myself
whatever
you
may
say
or
pretend
to
think
it
means
i
know
what
it
says
hear
shouted
several
voices
and
angry
cries
of
do
you
drink
the
poison
began
to
be
heard
from
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
you
going
to
drink
it
or
not
demanded
the
man
with
the
bottle
i
not
such
a
fool
retorted
misery
fiercely
and
a
loud
shout
of
laughter
broke
from
the
crowd
some
of
the
other
believers
would
like
to
said
the
young
man
sneeringly
looking
round
upon
the
disciples
as
no
one
seemed
desirous
of
availing
himself
of
this
offer
the
man
returned
the
bottle
regretfully
to
his
pocket
suppose
said
misery
regarding
the
owner
of
the
strychnine
with
a
sneer
suppose
you
one
of
them
there
hired
critics
wot
about
the
country
doin
the
devil
work
i
wants
to
know
is
this
said
the
suddenly
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
ring
and
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
did
cain
get
wife
from
answer
brother
said
mr
didlum
one
of
the
disciples
this
was
rather
an
unnecessary
piece
of
advice
because
misery
did
not
know
the
answer
an
individual
in
a
long
black
garment
the
now
whispered
something
to
miss
didlum
who
was
seated
at
the
organ
whereupon
she
began
to
play
and
the
began
to
sing
as
loud
as
they
could
so
as
to
drown
the
voices
of
the
disturbers
of
the
meeting
a
song
called
that
will
be
glory
for
me
after
this
hymn
the
invited
a
shabbily
dressed
a
member
of
the
psa
to
say
a
words
and
the
latter
accordingly
stepped
into
the
centre
of
the
ring
and
held
forth
as
follows
dear
frens
i
thank
gord
tonight
that
i
can
stand

hout

and
to

glory
amen
said
the
believers
fervently
and
then
the
man
who
was
dressed
in
the
long
garment
entreated
all
those
who
were
not
yet
true
believers
and
doers
of
the
word
to
join
earnestly
and
meaningly
in
the
singing
of
the
closing
hymn
which
he
was
about
to
read
out
to
them
the
obligingly
conducted
as
before
and
the
crowd
faded
away
with
the
last
notes
of
the
music
chapter
ruth
as
has
already
been
stated
hitherto
slyme
had
passed
the
greater
number
of
his
evenings
at
home
but
during
the
following
three
weeks
a
change
took
place
in
his
habits
in
this
respect
he
now
went
out
nearly
every
night
and
did
not
return
until
after
ten
on
meeting
nights
he
always
changed
his
attire
dressing
himself
as
on
sundays
but
on
the
other
occasions
he
went
out
in
his
clothes
ruth
often
wondered
where
he
went
on
those
nights
but
he
never
volunteered
the
information
and
she
never
asked
him
easton
had
chummed
up
with
a
lot
of
the
regular
customers
at
the
where
he
now
spent
most
of
his
spare
time
drinking
beer
telling
yarns
or
playing
or
hooks
and
rings
when
he
had
no
cash
the
old
dear
gave
him
credit
until
saturday
at
first
the
place
had
not
had
much
attraction
for
him
and
he
really
went
there
only
for
the
purpose
of
in
with
crass
but
after
a
time
he
found
it
a
very
congenial
way
of
passing
his
evenings
one
evening
ruth
saw
slyme
meet
crass
as
if
by
appointment
and
as
the
two
men
went
away
together
she
returned
to
her
housework
wondering
what
it
meant
meantime
crass
and
slyme
proceeded
on
their
way
down
town
it
was
about
half
past
six
the
shops
and
streets
were
brilliantly
lighted
and
as
they
went
along
they
saw
numerous
groups
of
men
talking
together
in
a
listless
way
most
of
them
were
artisans
and
labourers
out
of
employment
and
evidently
in
no
great
hurry
to
go
home
some
of
them
had
neither
tea
nor
fire
to
go
to
and
stayed
away
from
home
as
long
as
possible
so
as
not
to
be
compelled
to
look
upon
the
misery
of
those
who
were
waiting
for
them
there
others
hung
about
hoping
against
all
probability
that
they
might
even
yet
although
it
was
so
late
hear
of
some
job
to
be
started
somewhere
or
other
as
they
passed
one
of
these
groups
they
recognized
and
nodded
to
newman
and
old
jack
linden
and
the
former
left
the
others
and
came
up
to
crass
and
slyme
who
did
not
pause
so
newman
walked
along
with
them
fresh
in
bob
he
asked

ai
got

replied
crass

newman
we
just
about

as
far
as
we
can
get
at
home
slyme
and
crass
said
nothing
in
reply
to
this
they
wished
that
newman
would
take
himself
off
because
they
did
not
want
him
to
know
where
they
were
going
however
newman
continued
to
accompany
them
and
an
awkward
silence
succeeded
he
seemed
to
wish
to
say
something
more
and
they
both
guessed
what
it
was
so
they
walked
along
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
order
not
to
give
him
any
encouragement
at
last
newman
blurted
out
suppose
you
do
happen
either
of
you
to
have
a
tanner

could
lend
me
i
let
you
have
it

when
i
get
a
job
ai
mate
replied
crass
sorry
if
i
one
on
me
you
should
it
with
pleasure
slyme
also
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
no
money
with
him
and
at
the
corner
of
the
next
street
newman
ashamed
of
having
asked
wished
them
night
and
went
away
slyme
and
crass
hurried
along
and
presently
arrived
at
rushton
shop
the
windows
were
lit
up
with
electric
light
displaying
an
assortment
of
wallpapers
gas
and
electric
light
fittings
glass
shades
globes
tins
of
enamel
paint
and
varnish
several
framed
free
class
work
only
at
moderate
charges
first
class
workmen
employed
and
several
others
of
the
same
type
on
one
side
wall
of
the
window
was
a
large
board
covered
with
black
velvet
on
which
a
number
of
brass
fittings
for
coffins
were
arranged
the
shield
was
on
an
oak
mount
with
the
inscription
conducted
on
modern
principles
slyme
waited
outside
while
crass
went
in
mr
budd
the
shopman
was
down
at
the
far
end
near
the
glazed
partition
which
separated
mr
rushton
office
from
the
front
shop
as
crass
entered
budd
who
was
a
undersized
youth
about
twenty
years
of
age
looked
round
and
with
a
grimace
motioned
him
to
walk
softly
crass
paused
wondering
what
the
other
meant
but
the
shopman
beckoned
him
to
advance
grinning
and
winking
and
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
office
crass
hesitated
fearing
that
possibly
the
miserable
budd
had
gone
or
been
driven
out
of
his
mind
but
as
the
latter
continued
to
beckon
and
grin
and
point
towards
the
office
crass
screwed
up
his
courage
and
followed
him
behind
one
of
the
showcases
and
applying
his
eye
to
a
crack
in
the
woodwork
of
the
partition
indicated
by
budd
he
could
see
mr
rushton
in
the
act
of
kissing
and
embracing
miss
wade
the
young
lady
clerk
crass
watched
them
for
some
time
and
then
whispered
to
budd
to
call
slyme
and
when
the
latter
came
they
all
three
took
turns
at
peeping
through
the
crack
in
the
partition
when
they
had
looked
their
fill
they
came
out
from
behind
the
showcase
almost
bursting
with
suppressed
merriment
budd
reached
down
a
key
from
where
it
was
hanging
on
a
hook
on
the
wall
and
gave
it
to
crass
and
the
two
resumed
their
interrupted
journey
but
before
they
had
proceeded
a
dozen
yards
from
the
shop
they
were
accosted
by
a
short
elderly
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
beard
this
man
looked
about
years
of
age
and
was
very
shabbily
dressed
the
ends
of
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
were
frayed
and
ragged
and
the
elbows
were
worn
threadbare
his
boots
were
patched
broken
and
down
at
heel
and
the
knees
and
bottoms
of
the
legs
of
his
trousers
were
in
the
same
condition
as
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
this
man
name
was
latham
he
was
a
venetian
blind
maker
and
repairer
with
his
son
he
was
supposed
to
be
business
on
his
own
account
but
as
most
of
their
work
was
done
for
trade
that
is
for
such
firms
as
rushton
they
would
be
more
correctly
described
as
men
who
did
piecework
at
home
he
had
been
business
as
he
called
it
for
about
forty
years
working
working
always
working
and
ever
since
his
son
became
old
enough
to
labour
he
had
helped
his
father
in
the
philanthropic
task
of
manufacturing
profits
for
the
sweaters
who
employed
them
they
had
been
so
busy
running
after
work
and
working
for
the
benefit
of
others
that
they
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
they
were
only
earning
a
bare
living
for
themselves
and
now
after
forty
years
hard
labour
the
old
man
was
clothed
in
rags
and
on
the
verge
of
destitution
rushton
there
he
asked
i
think
so
replied
crass
attempting
to
pass
on
but
the
old
man
detained
him
promised
to
let
us
know
about
them
blinds
for
the
cave
we
gave
a
price
for
about
a
month
ago
in
fact
we
gave
two
prices
because
he
said
the
first
was
too
high
five
and
six
a
set
i
asked
take
right
through
the
one
with
another
big
and
little
two
coats
of
paint
and
new
tapes
and
cords
that
was
too
much
was
it
said
crass
walking
on
was
cheap
enough
he
said
it
was
too
much
continued
latham
as
could
get
done
cheaper
but
i
say
as
no
one
ca
do
it
and
make
a
living
as
he
walked
along
talking
between
crass
and
slyme
the
old
man
became
very
excited
we
nothing
to
do
to
speak
of
so
my
son
told
we
do
for
five
bob
a
set
and
said
let
us
know
but
we

from
yet
so
i
thought
i
try
and
see
tonight

in
there
now
said
slyme
with
a
peculiar
look
and
walking
faster
night
wo
take
on
for
no
less
cried
the
old
man
as
he
turned
back
i
got
my
livin

get
and
my
son
got
wife
and
little
to
keep
we
ca

crass
glad
to
get
away
at
last
night
and
good
luck
to
you
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
they
both
burst
out
laughing
at
the
old
man
vehemence
quite
upset
about
it
said
slyme
and
they
laughed
again
they
now
left
the
main
road
and
pursued
their
way
through
a
number
of
badly
lighted
streets
and
finally
turning
down
a
kind
of
alley
arrived
at
their
destination
on
one
side
of
this
street
was
a
row
of
small
houses
facing
these
were
a
number
of
buildings
of
a
miscellaneous
description
sheds
and
stables
and
beyond
these
a
plot
of
waste
ground
on
which
could
be
seen
looming
weirdly
through
the
dusk
a
number
of
empty
carts
and
waggons
with
their
shafts
resting
on
the
ground
or
reared
up
into
the
air
threading
their
way
carefully
through
these
and
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
the
mud
pools
of
water
and
rubbish
which
covered
the
ground
they
arrived
at
a
large
gate
fastened
with
a
padlock
applying
the
key
crass
swung
back
the
gate
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
large
yard
filled
with
building
materials
and
plant
ladders
huge
tressels
planks
and
beams
of
wood
and
wheelbarrows
heaps
of
sand
and
mortar
and
innumerable
other
things
that
assumed
strange
fantastic
shapes
in
the
crates
and
packing
cases
lengths
of
iron
guttering
and
old
and
other
woodwork
that
had
been
taken
from
buildings
where
alterations
had
been
made
and
over
all
these
things
a
gloomy
indistinct
and
shapeless
mass
rose
the
buildings
and
sheds
that
comprised
rushton
workshop
crass
struck
a
match
and
slyme
stooping
down
drew
a
key
from
a
crevice
in
the
wall
near
one
of
the
doors
which
he
unlocked
and
they
entered
crass
struck
another
match
and
lit
the
gas
at
the
jointed
bracket
fixed
to
the
wall
this
was
the
at
one
end
was
a
fireplace
without
a
grate
but
with
an
iron
bar
fixed
across
the
blackened
chimney
for
the
purpose
of
suspending
pails
or
pots
over
the
fire
which
was
usually
made
of
wood
on
the
hearthstone
all
round
the
walls
of
the
shop
which
had
once
been
whitewashed
but
were
now
covered
with
smears
of
paint
of
every
colour
where
the
men
had
out
their
brushes
were
rows
of
shelves
with
kegs
of
paint
upon
them
in
front
of
the
window
was
a
long
bench
covered
with
an
untidy
litter
of
dirty
including
several
earthenware
mixing
vessels
or
mortars
the
sides
of
these
being
thickly
coated
with
dried
paint
scattered
about
the
stone
floor
were
a
number
of
dirty
pails
either
empty
or
containing
stale
whitewash
and
standing
on
a
sort
of
low
platform
or
shelf
at
one
end
of
the
shop
were
four
large
round
tanks
fitted
with
taps
and
labelled
oil
oil
substitute
the
lower
parts
of
the
walls
were
discoloured
with
moisture
the
atmosphere
was
cold
and
damp
and
foul
with
the
sickening
odours
of
the
poisonous
materials
it
was
in
this
place
that
bert
the
apprentice
spent
most
of
his
time
cleaning
out
pots
and
pails
during
slack
periods
when
there
were
no
jobs
going
on
outside
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
under
a
gas
pendant
was
another
table
or
bench
also
thickly
coated
with
old
dried
paint
and
by
the
side
of
this
were
two
large
stands
on
which
were
hanging
up
to
dry
some
of
the
lathes
of
the
venetian
blinds
belonging
to
cave
which
crass
and
slyme
were
painting
piecework
in
their
spare
time
the
remainder
of
the
lathes
were
leaning
against
the
walls
or
piled
in
stacks
on
the
table
crass
shivered
with
cold
as
he
lit
the
two
a
bit
of
a
fire
alf
he
said
i
gets
the
colour
ready
slyme
went
outside
and
presently
returned
with
his
arms
full
of
old
wood
which
he
smashed
up
and
threw
into
the
fireplace
then
he
took
an
empty
and
filled
it
with
turpentine
from
the
big
tank
and
emptied
it
over
the
wood
amongst
the
pots
on
the
mixing
bench
he
found
one
full
of
old
paint
and
he
threw
this
over
the
wood
also
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
made
a
roaring
fire
meantime
crass
had
prepared
the
paint
and
brushes
and
taken
down
the
lathes
from
the
drying
frames
the
two
men
now
proceeded
with
the
painting
of
the
blinds
working
rapidly
each
lathe
being
hung
on
the
wires
of
the
drying
frame
after
being
painted
they
talked
freely
as
they
worked
having
no
fear
of
being
overheard
by
rushton
or
nimrod
this
job
was
piecework
so
it
did
matter
whether
they
talked
or
not
they
waxed
hilarious
over
old
latham
discomfiture
and
wondered
what
he
would
say
if
he
could
see
them
now
then
the
conversation
drifted
to
the
subject
of
the
private
characters
of
the
other
men
who
were
employed
by
rushton
and
an
impartial
listener
had
there
been
one
there
would
have
been
forced
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
crass
and
slyme
did
namely
that
they
themselves
were
the
only
two
decent
fellows
on
the
firm
there
was
something
wrong
or
shady
about
everybody
else
that
bloke
barrington
for
instance
it
was
a
very
funny
business
you
know
for
a
chap
like
to
be
workin
as
a
labourer
it
looked
very
suspicious
nobody
knowed
exactly
who
was
or
where
come
from
but
anyone
could
tell
been
a
toff
it
was
very
certain
never
bin
brought
up
to
work
for
livin
the
most
probable
explanation
was
that
committed
some
crime
and
bin
disowned
by
family
pinched
some
money
or
forged
a
cheque
or
something
like
that
then
there
was
that
sawkins
he
was
no
class
whatever
it
was
a
fact
that
he
used
to
go
round
to
misery
house
nearly
every
night
to
tell
him
every
little
thing
that
had
happened
on
the
job
during
the
day
as
for
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
the
man
was
a
perfect
fool
he
find
out
the
difference
if
ever
he
got
the
sack
from
rushton
and
went
to
work
for
some
other
firm
he
did
understand
his
trade
and
he
could
make
a
coffin
properly
to
save
life
then
there
was
that
rotter
owen
there
was
a
bright
specimen
for
yer
an
atheist
did
believe
in
no
god
or
devil
or
nothing
else
a
pretty
state
of
things
there
would
be
if
these
socialists
could
have
their
own
way
for
one
thing
nobody
would
be
allowed
to
work
overtime
crass
and
slyme
worked
and
talked
in
this
manner
till
ten
and
then
they
extinguished
the
fire
by
throwing
some
water
on
it
put
out
the
gas
and
locked
up
the
shop
and
the
yard
dropping
the
key
of
the
latter
into
the
at
rushton
office
on
their
way
home
in
this
way
they
worked
at
the
blinds
nearly
every
night
for
three
weeks
when
saturday
arrived
the
men
working
at
cave
were
again
surprised
that
nobody
was
sacked
and
they
were
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
reason
some
thinking
that
nimrod
was
determined
to
keep
them
all
on
till
the
job
was
finished
so
as
to
get
it
done
as
quickly
as
possible
and
others
boldly
asserting
the
truth
of
a
rumour
that
had
been
going
about
for
several
days
that
the
firm
had
another
big
job
in
mr
sweater
had
bought
another
house
rushton
had
to
do
it
up
and
they
were
all
to
be
kept
on
to
start
this
other
work
as
soon
as
was
finished
crass
knew
no
more
than
anyone
else
and
he
maintained
a
discreet
silence
but
the
fact
that
he
did
not
contradict
the
rumour
served
to
strengthen
it
the
only
foundation
that
existed
for
this
report
was
that
rushton
and
misery
had
been
seen
looking
over
the
garden
gate
of
a
large
empty
house
near
cave
but
although
it
had
such
an
insignificant
beginning
the
rumour
had
grown
and
increased
in
detail
and
importance
day
by
day
that
very
morning
at
the
man
on
the
pail
had
announced
that
he
had
heard
on
the
very
best
authority
that
mr
sweater
had
sold
all
his
interest
in
the
great
business
that
bore
his
name
and
was
about
to
retire
into
private
life
and
that
he
intended
to
buy
up
all
the
house
property
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cave
another
individual
one
of
the
new
hands
said
that
he
had
heard
someone
else
in
a
public
house
say
that
rushton
was
about
to
marry
one
of
sweater
daughters
and
that
sweater
intended
to
give
the
couple
a
house
to
live
in
as
a
wedding
present
but
the
fact
that
rushton
was
already
married
and
the
father
of
four
children
rather
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
this
story
so
it
was
regretfully
dismissed
whatever
the
reason
the
fact
remained
that
nobody
had
been
discharged
and
when
arrived
they
set
out
for
the
office
in
high
spirits
that
evening
the
weather
being
fine
slyme
went
out
as
usual
to
his
meeting
but
easton
departed
from
his
usual
custom
of
rushing
off
to
the
directly
he
had
had
his
tea
having
on
this
occasion
promised
to
wait
for
ruth
and
to
go
with
her
to
do
the
marketing
the
baby
was
left
at
home
alone
asleep
in
the
cradle
by
the
time
they
had
made
all
their
purchases
they
had
a
fairly
heavy
load
easton
carried
the
containing
the
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
and
the
meat
and
ruth
the
groceries
on
their
way
home
they
had
to
pass
the
and
just
before
they
reached
that
part
of
their
journey
they
met
mr
and
mrs
crass
who
were
also
out
marketing
they
both
insisted
on
easton
and
ruth
going
in
to
have
a
drink
with
them
ruth
did
not
want
to
go
but
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
for
she
could
see
that
easton
was
beginning
to
get
angry
with
her
for
refusing
crass
had
on
a
new
overcoat
and
a
new
hat
with
dark
grey
trousers
and
yellow
boots
and
a
collar
with
a
bright
blue
tie
his
wife
a
fat
woman
about
forty
was
arrayed
in
a
dark
red
costume
with
hat
to
match
both
easton
and
ruth
whose
best
clothes
had
all
been
pawned
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
the
poor
rate
felt
very
mean
and
shabby
before
them
when
they
got
inside
crass
paid
for
the
first
round
of
drinks
a
pint
of
old
six
for
himself
the
same
for
easton
half
a
pint
for
mrs
easton
and
of
gin
for
mrs
crass
the
besotted
wretch
was
there
just
finishing
a
game
of
hooks
and
rings
with
the
who
had
called
round
on
the
day
after
he
was
thrown
out
to
apologize
for
his
conduct
to
the
old
dear
and
had
since
then
become
one
of
the
regular
customers
philpot
was
absent
he
had
been
there
that
afternoon
so
the
old
dear
said
but
he
had
gone
home
about
five
and
had
not
been
back
since
he
was
almost
sure
to
look
in
again
in
the
course
of
the
evening
although
the
house
was
not
nearly
so
full
as
it
would
have
been
if
times
had
been
better
there
was
a
large
number
of
people
there
for
the
was
one
of
the
most
popular
houses
in
the
town
another
thing
that
helped
to
make
them
busy
was
the
fact
that
two
other
public
houses
in
the
vicinity
had
recently
been
closed
up
there
were
people
in
all
the
compartments
some
of
the
seats
in
the
public
bar
were
occupied
by
women
some
young
and
accompanied
by
their
husbands
some
old
and
evidently
sodden
with
drink
in
one
corner
of
the
public
bar
drinking
beer
or
gin
with
a
number
of
young
fellows
were
three
young
girls
who
worked
at
a
steam
laundry
in
the
neighbourhood
two
large
fat
women
evidently
hawkers
for
on
the
floor
beside
them
were
two
baskets
containing
bundles
of
flowers
chrysanthemums
and
michaelmas
daisies
there
were
also
two
very
plainly
and
shabbily
dressed
women
about
years
of
age
who
were
always
to
be
found
there
on
saturday
nights
drinking
with
any
man
who
was
willing
to
pay
for
them
the
behaviour
of
these
two
women
was
very
quiet
and
their
manners
unobtrusive
they
seemed
to
realize
that
they
were
there
only
on
sufferance
and
their
demeanour
was
shamefaced
and
humble
the
majority
of
the
guests
were
standing
the
floor
was
sprinkled
with
sawdust
which
served
to
soak
up
the
beer
that
slopped
out
of
the
glasses
of
those
whose
hands
were
too
unsteady
to
hold
them
upright
the
air
was
foul
with
the
smell
of
beer
spirits
and
tobacco
smoke
and
the
uproar
was
deafening
for
nearly
everyone
was
talking
at
the
same
time
their
voices
clashing
discordantly
with
the
strains
of
the
polyphone
which
was
playing
garden
of
your
heart
in
one
corner
a
group
of
men
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
details
of
a
dirty
story
related
by
one
of
their
number
several
impatient
customers
were
banging
the
bottoms
of
their
empty
glasses
or
pewters
on
the
counter
and
shouting
their
orders
for
more
beer
oaths
curses
and
obscene
expressions
resounded
on
every
hand
coming
almost
as
frequently
from
the
women
as
the
men
and
over
all
the
rattle
of
money
the
ringing
of
the
cash
register
the
clinking
and
rattling
of
the
glasses
and
pewter
pots
as
they
were
being
washed
and
the
gurgling
noise
made
by
the
beer
as
it
poured
into
the
drinking
vessels
from
the
taps
of
the
beer
engine
whose
handles
were
almost
incessantly
manipulated
by
the
barman
the
old
dear
and
the
glittering
landlady
whose
silken
blouse
bejewelled
hair
ears
neck
and
fingers
scintillated
gloriously
in
the
blaze
of
the
gaslight
the
scene
was
so
novel
and
strange
to
ruth
that
she
felt
dazed
and
bewildered
previous
to
her
marriage
she
had
been
a
total
abstainer
but
since
then
she
had
occasionally
taken
a
glass
of
beer
with
easton
for
company
sake
with
their
sunday
dinner
at
home
but
it
was
generally
easton
who
went
out
and
bought
the
beer
in
a
jug
once
or
twice
she
had
bought
it
herself
at
an
off
licence
near
where
they
lived
but
she
had
never
before
been
in
a
public
house
to
drink
she
was
so
confused
and
ill
at
ease
that
she
scarcely
heard
or
understood
mrs
crass
who
talked
incessantly
principally
about
their
other
residents
in
north
street
where
they
both
resided
and
about
mr
crass
she
also
promised
ruth
to
introduce
her
presently
if
he
came
in
as
he
was
almost
certain
to
do
to
mr
partaker
one
of
her
two
lodgers
a
most
superior
young
man
who
had
been
with
them
now
for
over
three
years
and
would
not
leave
on
any
account
in
fact
he
had
been
their
lodger
in
their
old
house
and
when
they
moved
he
came
with
them
to
north
street
although
it
was
farther
away
from
his
place
of
business
than
their
former
residence
mrs
crass
talked
a
lot
more
of
the
same
sort
of
stuff
to
which
ruth
listened
like
one
in
a
dream
and
answered
with
an
occasional
yes
or
no
meantime
crass
and
easton
the
latter
had
deposited
the
on
the
seat
at
ruth
side
and
the
and
the
besotted
wretch
arranged
to
play
a
match
of
hooks
and
rings
the
losers
to
pay
for
drinks
for
all
the
party
including
the
two
women
crass
and
the
tossed
up
for
sides
crass
won
and
picked
the
besotted
wretch
and
the
game
began
it
was
a
affair
from
the
first
for
easton
and
the
were
no
match
for
the
other
two
the
end
of
it
was
that
easton
and
his
partner
had
to
pay
for
the
drinks
the
four
men
had
a
pint
each
of
four
ale
and
mrs
crass
had
another
threepennyworth
of
gin
ruth
protested
that
she
did
not
want
any
more
to
drink
but
the
others
ridiculed
this
and
both
the
besotted
wretch
and
the
seemed
to
regard
her
unwillingness
as
a
personal
insult
so
she
allowed
them
to
get
her
another
of
beer
which
she
was
compelled
to
drink
because
she
was
conscious
that
the
others
were
watching
her
to
see
that
she
did
so
the
now
suggested
a
return
match
he
wished
to
have
his
revenge
he
was
a
little
out
of
practice
he
said
and
was
only
just
getting
his
hand
in
as
they
were
finishing
the
other
game
crass
and
his
partner
readily
assented
and
in
spite
of
ruth
whispered
entreaty
that
they
should
return
home
without
further
delay
easton
insisted
on
joining
the
game
although
they
played
more
carefully
than
before
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
besotted
wretch
was
very
drunk
easton
and
his
partner
were
again
beaten
and
once
more
had
to
pay
for
the
drinks
the
men
had
a
pint
each
as
before
mrs
crass
upon
whom
the
liquor
so
far
seemed
to
have
no
effect
had
another
threepennyworth
of
gin
and
ruth
consented
to
take
another
glass
of
beer
on
condition
that
easton
would
come
away
directly
their
drinks
were
finished
easton
agreed
to
do
so
but
instead
of
keeping
his
word
he
began
to
play
a
game
of
with
the
other
three
the
sides
and
stakes
being
arranged
as
before
the
liquor
was
by
this
time
beginning
to
have
some
effect
upon
ruth
she
felt
dizzy
and
confused
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
reply
to
mrs
crass
talk
she
found
some
difficulty
in
articulating
the
words
and
she
knew
she
was
not
answering
very
intelligently
even
when
mrs
crass
introduced
her
to
the
interesting
mr
partaker
who
arrived
about
this
time
she
was
scarcely
able
to
collect
herself
sufficiently
to
decline
that
fascinating
gentleman
invitation
to
have
another
drink
with
himself
and
mrs
crass
after
a
time
a
kind
of
terror
took
possession
of
her
and
she
resolved
that
if
easton
would
not
come
when
he
had
finished
the
game
he
was
playing
she
would
go
home
without
him
meantime
the
game
of
proceeded
merrily
the
majority
of
the
male
guests
crowding
round
the
board
applauding
or
censuring
the
players
as
occasion
demanded
the
was
in
high
glee
for
crass
was
not
much
of
a
hand
at
this
game
and
the
besotted
wretch
although
playing
well
was
not
able
to
make
up
for
his
partner
want
of
skill
as
the
game
drew
near
its
end
and
it
became
more
and
more
certain
that
his
opponents
would
be
defeated
the
joy
of
the
was
unbounded
and
he
challenged
them
to
make
it
double
or
quits
a
generous
offer
which
they
wisely
declined
and
shortly
afterwards
seeing
that
their
position
was
hopeless
they
capitulated
and
prepared
to
pay
the
penalty
of
the
vanquished
crass
ordered
the
drinks
and
the
besotted
wretch
paid
half
the
damage
a
pint
of
four
ale
for
each
of
the
men
and
the
same
as
before
for
the
ladies
the
old
dear
executed
the
order
but
by
mistake
being
very
busy
he
served
two
of
gin
instead
of
one
ruth
did
not
want
any
more
at
all
but
she
was
afraid
to
say
so
and
she
did
not
like
to
make
any
fuss
about
it
being
the
wrong
drink
especially
as
they
all
assured
her
that
the
spirits
would
do
her
more
good
than
beer
she
did
not
want
either
she
wanted
to
get
away
and
would
have
liked
to
empty
the
stuff
out
of
the
glass
on
the
floor
but
she
was
afraid
that
mrs
crass
or
one
of
the
others
might
see
her
doing
so
and
there
might
be
some
trouble
about
it
anyway
it
seemed
easier
to
drink
this
small
quantity
of
spirits
and
water
than
a
big
glass
of
beer
the
very
thought
of
which
now
made
her
feel
she
drank
the
stuff
which
easton
handed
to
her
at
a
single
draught
and
handing
back
the
empty
glass
with
a
shudder
stood
up
resolutely
you
coming
home
now
you
promised
you
would
she
said
right
presently
replied
easton
plenty
of
time
not
nine
yet
does
matter
it
quite
late
enough
you
know
we
left
the
child
at
home
alone
in
the
house
you
promised
you
come
as
soon
as
you
finished
that
other
game
right
all
right
answered
easton
impatiently
wait
a
minute
i
want
to
see
this
and
then
i
come
was
a
most
interesting
problem
propounded
by
crass
who
had
arranged
eleven
matches
side
by
side
on
the
board
the
problem
was
to
take
none
away
and
yet
leave
only
nine
nearly
all
the
men
in
the
bar
were
crowding
round
the
board
some
with
knitted
brows
and
drunken
gravity
trying
to
solve
the
puzzle
and
others
waiting
curiously
for
the
result
easton
crossed
over
to
see
how
it
was
done
and
as
none
of
the
crowd
were
able
to
do
the
trick
crass
showed
that
it
could
be
accomplished
by
simply
arranging
the
eleven
matches
so
as
to
form
the
word
nine
everybody
said
it
was
very
good
indeed
very
clever
and
interesting
but
the
and
the
besotted
wretch
were
reminded
by
this
trick
of
several
others
equally
good
and
they
proceeded
to
do
them
and
then
the
men
had
another
pint
each
all
round
as
a
reviver
after
the
mental
strain
of
the
last
few
minutes
easton
did
not
know
any
tricks
himself
but
he
was
an
interested
spectator
of
those
done
by
several
others
until
ruth
came
over
and
touched
his
arm
you
coming
a
minute
ca
you
cried
easton
roughly
your
hurry
do
want
to
stay
here
any
longer
said
ruth
hysterically
said
you
come
as
soon
as
you
saw
that
trick
if
you
do
come
i
shall
go
home
by
myself
i
do
want
to
stay
in
this
place
any
longer
go
by
yourself
if
you
want
to
shouted
easton
fiercely
pushing
her
away
from
him
shall
stop
as
long
as
i
please
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
do
the
other
thing
ruth
staggered
and
nearly
fell
from
the
force
of
the
push
he
gave
her
and
the
man
turned
again
to
the
table
to
watch
the
who
was
arranging
six
matches
so
as
to
form
the
numeral
xii
and
who
said
he
could
prove
that
this
was
equal
to
a
thousand
ruth
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
as
easton
took
no
further
notice
of
her
she
took
up
the
and
the
other
parcels
and
without
staying
to
say
good
night
to
mrs
crass
who
was
earnestly
conversing
with
the
interesting
partaker
she
with
some
difficulty
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
street
the
cold
night
air
felt
refreshing
and
sweet
after
the
foul
atmosphere
of
the
public
house
but
after
a
little
while
she
began
to
feel
faint
and
dizzy
and
was
conscious
also
that
she
was
walking
unsteadily
and
she
fancied
that
people
stared
at
her
strangely
as
they
passed
the
parcels
felt
very
heavy
and
awkward
to
carry
and
the
seemed
as
if
it
were
filled
with
lead
although
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
was
only
about
ten
walk
home
from
here
she
resolved
to
go
by
one
of
the
trams
which
passed
by
the
end
of
north
street
with
this
intention
she
put
down
her
bag
on
the
pavement
at
the
and
waited
resting
her
hand
on
the
iron
pillar
at
the
corner
of
the
street
where
a
little
crowd
of
people
were
standing
evidently
with
the
same
object
as
herself
two
trains
passed
without
stopping
for
they
were
already
full
of
passengers
a
common
circumstance
on
saturday
nights
the
next
one
stopped
and
several
persons
alighted
and
then
ensued
a
fierce
struggle
amongst
the
waiting
crowd
for
the
vacant
seats
men
and
women
pushed
pulled
and
almost
fought
shoving
their
fists
and
elbows
into
each
other
sides
and
breasts
and
faces
ruth
was
quickly
thrust
aside
and
nearly
knocked
down
and
the
tram
having
taken
aboard
as
many
passengers
as
it
had
accommodation
for
passed
on
she
waited
for
the
next
one
and
the
same
scene
was
enacted
with
the
same
result
for
her
and
then
reflecting
that
if
she
had
not
stayed
for
these
trams
she
might
have
been
home
by
now
she
determined
to
resume
her
walk
the
parcels
felt
heavier
than
ever
and
she
had
not
proceeded
very
far
before
she
was
compelled
to
put
the
bag
down
again
upon
the
pavement
outside
an
empty
house
leaning
against
the
railings
she
felt
very
tired
and
everything
around
her
the
street
the
houses
the
traffic
seemed
vague
and
shadowy
and
unreal
several
people
looked
curiously
at
her
as
they
passed
but
by
this
time
she
was
scarcely
conscious
of
their
scrutiny
slyme
had
gone
that
evening
to
the
usual
conducted
by
the
shining
light
mission
the
weather
being
fine
they
had
a
most
successful
meeting
the
disciples
including
hunter
rushton
sweater
didlum
and
mrs
starvem
ruth
former
mistress
assembled
in
great
force
so
as
to
be
able
to
deal
more
effectively
with
any
infidels
or
hired
critics
or
drunken
scoffers
who
might
try
to
disturb
the
proceedings
and
possibly
as
an
evidence
of
how
much
real
faith
there
was
in
them
they
had
also
arranged
to
have
a
police
officer
in
attendance
to
protect
them
from
what
they
called
the
of
darkness
one
might
be
excused
for
thinking
that
if
they
really
believed
they
would
have
relied
rather
upon
those
powers
of
light
which
they
professed
to
represent
on
this
planet
to
protect
them
without
troubling
to
call
in
the
aid
of
such
a
force
as
the
police
however
it
came
to
pass
that
on
this
occasion
the
only
infidels
present
were
those
who
were
conducting
the
meeting
but
as
these
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
members
of
the
chapel
it
will
be
seen
that
the
infidel
fraternity
was
strongly
represented
on
his
way
home
after
the
meeting
slyme
had
to
pass
by
the
and
as
he
drew
near
the
place
he
wondered
if
easton
was
there
but
he
did
not
like
to
go
and
look
in
because
he
was
afraid
someone
might
see
him
coming
away
and
perhaps
think
he
had
been
in
to
drink
just
as
he
arrived
opposite
the
house
another
man
opened
the
door
of
the
public
bar
and
entered
enabling
slyme
to
catch
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
interior
where
he
saw
easton
and
crass
with
a
number
of
others
who
were
strangers
to
him
laughing
and
drinking
together
slyme
hurried
away
it
had
turned
very
cold
and
he
was
anxious
to
get
home
as
he
approached
the
place
where
the
trams
stopped
to
take
up
passengers
and
saw
that
there
was
a
tram
in
sight
he
resolved
to
wait
for
it
and
ride
home
but
when
the
tram
arrived
and
there
were
only
one
or
two
seats
vacant
and
although
he
did
his
best
to
secure
one
of
these
he
was
unsuccessful
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
decided
that
it
would
be
quicker
to
walk
than
to
wait
for
the
next
one
he
accordingly
resumed
his
journey
but
he
had
not
gone
very
far
when
he
saw
a
small
crowd
of
people
on
the
pavement
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
outside
an
unoccupied
house
and
although
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
he
crossed
over
to
see
what
was
the
matter
there
were
about
twenty
people
standing
there
and
in
the
centre
close
to
the
railing
there
were
three
or
four
women
whom
slyme
could
not
see
although
he
could
hear
their
voices
up
he
inquired
of
a
man
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
nothing
much
returned
the
other
young
woman
either
ill
come
over
faint
or
something
or
else
she
had
a
drop
too
much
a
young
party
too
said
another
man
several
young
fellows
in
the
crowd
were
amusing
themselves
by
making
suggestive
jokes
about
the
young
woman
and
causing
some
laughter
by
the
expressions
of
mock
sympathy
anyone
know
who
she
is
said
the
second
man
who
had
spoken
in
reply
to
slyme
inquiry
said
a
woman
who
was
standing
a
little
nearer
the
middle
of
the
crowd
she
wo
say
where
she
lives
be
all
right
now
she
had
that
glass
of
soda
said
another
man
elbowing
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
as
this
individual
came
out
slyme
managed
to
work
himself
a
little
further
into
the
group
of
people
and
he
uttered
an
involuntary
cry
of
astonishment
as
he
caught
sight
of
ruth
very
pale
and
looking
very
ill
as
she
stood
clasping
one
of
the
railings
with
her
left
hand
and
holding
the
packages
of
groceries
in
the
other
she
had
by
this
time
recovered
sufficiently
to
feel
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
confusion
before
the
crowd
of
strangers
who
hemmed
her
in
on
every
side
and
some
of
whom
she
could
hear
laughing
and
joking
about
her
it
was
therefore
with
a
sensation
of
intense
relief
and
gratitude
that
she
saw
slyme
familiar
face
and
heard
his
friendly
voice
as
he
forced
his
way
through
to
her
side
can
walk
home
all
right
now
she
stammered
in
reply
to
his
anxious
questioning
you
would
mind
carrying
some
of
these
things
for
me
he
insisted
on
taking
all
the
parcels
and
the
crowd
having
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
the
young
woman
husband
began
to
dwindle
away
one
of
the
jokers
remarking
all
over
in
a
loud
voice
as
he
took
himself
off
it
was
only
about
seven
minutes
walk
home
from
there
and
as
the
streets
along
which
they
had
to
pass
were
not
very
brilliantly
lighted
ruth
was
able
to
lean
on
slyme
arm
most
of
the
way
when
they
arrived
home
after
she
had
removed
her
hat
he
made
her
sit
down
in
the
armchair
by
the
fire
which
was
burning
brightly
and
the
kettle
was
singing
on
the
hob
for
she
had
banked
up
the
fire
with
cinders
and
small
coal
before
she
went
out
the
baby
was
still
asleep
in
the
cradle
but
his
slumbers
had
evidently
not
been
of
the
most
restful
kind
for
he
had
kicked
all
the
bedclothes
off
him
and
was
lying
all
uncovered
ruth
obeyed
passively
when
slyme
told
her
to
sit
down
and
lying
back
languidly
in
the
armchair
she
watched
him
through
eyes
and
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
face
as
he
deftly
covered
the
sleeping
child
with
the
bedclothes
and
settled
him
more
comfortably
in
the
cot
slyme
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
fire
and
as
he
placed
the
kettle
upon
it
he
remarked
soon
as
the
water
boils
i
make
you
some
strong
tea
during
their
walk
home
she
had
acquainted
slyme
with
the
cause
of
her
being
in
the
condition
in
which
he
found
her
in
the
street
and
as
she
reclined
in
the
armchair
drowsily
watching
him
she
wondered
what
would
have
happened
to
her
if
he
had
not
passed
by
when
he
did
you
feeling
better
he
asked
looking
down
at
her
thanks
i
feel
quite
well
now
but
i
afraid
i
given
you
a
lot
of
trouble
you
have
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
is
a
trouble
to
me
but
do
you
think
you
better
take
your
jacket
off
here
let
me
help
you
it
took
a
very
long
time
to
get
this
jacket
off
because
whilst
he
was
helping
her
slyme
kissed
her
repeatedly
and
passionately
as
she
lay
limp
and
unresisting
in
his
arms
chapter
the
oblong
during
the
following
week
the
work
at
cave
progressed
rapidly
towards
completion
although
the
hours
of
daylight
being
so
few
the
men
worked
only
from
till
and
they
had
their
breakfasts
before
they
came
this
made
hours
a
week
so
that
those
who
were
paid
sevenpence
an
hour
earned
those
who
got
drew
those
whose
wages
were
fivepence
an
hour
were
paid
the
princely
sum
of
for
their
week
hard
labour
and
those
whose
rate
was
up
and
yet
there
are
people
who
have
the
insolence
to
say
that
drink
is
the
cause
of
poverty
and
many
of
the
persons
who
say
this
spend
more
money
than
that
on
drink
themselves
every
day
of
their
useless
lives
by
tuesday
night
all
the
inside
was
finished
with
the
exception
of
the
kitchen
and
scullery
the
painting
of
the
kitchen
had
been
delayed
owing
to
the
of
the
new
cooking
range
and
the
scullery
was
still
used
as
the
paint
shop
the
outside
work
was
also
nearly
finished
all
the
first
coating
was
done
and
the
second
coating
was
being
proceeded
with
according
to
the
specification
all
the
outside
woodwork
was
supposed
to
have
three
coats
and
the
guttering
and
other
ironwork
two
coats
but
crass
and
hunter
had
arranged
to
make
two
coats
do
for
most
of
the
windows
and
woodwork
and
all
the
ironwork
was
to
be
made
to
do
with
one
coat
only
the
windows
were
painted
in
two
colours
the
sashes
dark
green
and
the
frames
white
all
the
rest
gables
doors
railings
guttering
was
dark
green
and
all
the
dark
green
paint
was
made
with
boiled
linseed
oil
and
varnish
no
turpentine
being
allowed
to
be
used
on
this
part
of
the
work

bloody
fine

a
corfin

this
afternoon
harlow
maintained
an
awestruck
silence
and
philpot
continued

a
drink
the
other
night
with
a
butcher
bloke
what
used
to
serve
this
parson
with
meat
and
we
was
talkin
about
what
a
strange
sort
of
death
it
was
but
said
was
at
all
surprised
to
of
it
the
only
thing
as
wondered
at
was
that
the
man
did
blow
up
long
ago
considerin
the
amount
of
grub
as
used
to
make
away
with
he
ses
the

i
gave

penny

cards
because
i
did
want

before
the
other
young

the
same
party
two
or
three

i

just
a
trifle
for
anything
like
to
be
gettin
colder
do
it
enough
to
freeze
the
ears
orf
a
brass
monkey
remarked
easton
as
he
descended
from
a
ladder
close
by
and
placing
his
pot
of
paint
on
the
pound
began
to
try
to
warm
his
hands
by
rubbing
and
beating
them
together
he
was
trembling
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
with
cold
could
just
do
with
a
nice
pint
of
beer
now
he
said
as
he
stamped
his
feet
on
the
pound
just
what
i
was
thinkin
said
philpot
wistfully
more
i
mean
to
one
too
at
i
shall
nip
down
to
the
cricketers
even
if
i
do
get
back
till
a

minutes
after

because
crass
and
nimrod
will
be
gorn
to
the
funeral
you
bring
me
a
pint
back
with
you
in
a
bottle
asked
easton
certainly
said
philpot
harlow
said
nothing
he
also
would
have
liked
a
pint
of
beer
but
as
was
usual
with
him
he
had
not
the
necessary
cash
having
restored
the
circulation
to
a
certain
extent
they
now
resumed
their
work
and
only
just
in
time
for
a
few
minutes
afterwards
they
observed
misery
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
house
at
them
and
they
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
there
and
whether
he
had
overheard
their
conversation
at
twelve
crass
and
slyme
cleared
off
in
a
great
hurry
and
a
little
while
afterwards
philpot
took
off
his
apron
and
put
on
his
coat
to
go
to
the
when
the
others
found
out
where
he
was
going
several
of
them
asked
him
to
bring
back
a
drink
for
them
and
then
someone
suggested
that
all
those
who
wanted
some
beer
should
give
twopence
each
this
was
done
one
shilling
and
fourpence
was
collected
and
given
to
philpot
who
was
to
bring
back
a
gallon
of
beer
in
a
jar
he
promised
to
get
back
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
and
some
of
the
shareholders
decided
not
to
drink
any
tea
with
their
dinners
but
to
wait
for
the
beer
although
they
knew
that
it
would
be
nearly
time
to
resume
work
before
he
could
get
back
it
would
be
a
quarter
to
one
at
the
very
earliest
the
minutes
dragged
slowly
by
and
after
a
while
the
only
man
on
the
job
who
had
a
watch
began
to
lose
his
temper
and
refused
to
answer
any
more
inquiries
concerning
the
time
so
presently
bert
was
sent
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
look
at
a
church
clock
which
was
visible
therefrom
and
when
he
came
down
he
reported
that
it
was
ten
minutes
to
one
symptoms
of
anxiety
now
began
to
manifest
themselves
amongst
the
shareholders
several
of
whom
went
down
to
the
main
road
to
see
if
philpot
was
yet
in
sight
but
each
returned
with
the
same
report
they
could
see
nothing
of
him
no
one
was
formally
charge
of
the
job
during
crass
absence
but
they
all
returned
to
their
work
promptly
at
one
because
they
feared
that
sawkins
or
some
other
sneak
might
report
any
irregularity
to
crass
or
misery
at
a
one
philpot
was
still
missing
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
shareholders
began
to
develop
into
a
panic
some
of
them
plainly
expressed
the
opinion
that
he
had
gone
on
the
razzle
with
the
money
as
the
time
wore
on
this
became
the
general
opinion
at
two
all
hope
of
his
return
having
been
abandoned
two
or
three
of
the
shareholders
went
and
drank
some
of
the
cold
tea
their
fears
were
only
too
well
founded
for
they
saw
no
more
of
philpot
till
the
next
morning
when
he
arrived
looking
very
sheepish
and
repentant
and
promised
to
refund
all
the
money
on
saturday
he
also
made
a
long
rambling
statement
from
which
it
appeared
that
on
his
way
to
the
he
met
a
couple
of
chaps
whom
he
knew
who
were
out
of
work
and
he
invited
them
to
come
and
have
a
drink
when
they
got
to
the
pub
they
found
there
the
and
the
besotted
wretch
one
drink
led
to
another
and
then
they
started
arguing
and
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
gallon
of
beer
until
he
woke
up
this
morning
whilst
philpot
was
making
this
explanation
they
were
putting
on
their
aprons
and
blouses
and
crass
was
serving
out
the
lots
of
colour
slyme
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
but
got
ready
as
quickly
as
possible
and
went
outside
to
make
a
start
the
reason
for
this
haste
soon
became
apparent
to
some
of
the
others
for
they
noticed
that
he
had
selected
and
commenced
painting
a
large
window
that
was
so
situated
as
to
be
sheltered
from
the
keen
wind
that
was
blowing
the
basement
of
the
house
was
slightly
below
the
level
of
the
ground
and
there
was
a
sort
of
a
trench
or
area
about
three
feet
deep
in
front
of
the
basement
windows
the
banks
of
this
trench
were
covered
with
rose
trees
and
evergreens
and
the
bottom
was
a
mass
of
slimy
earth
foul
with
the
excrement
of
nocturnal
animals
to
these
basement
windows
philpot
and
harlow
had
to
get
down
into
and
stand
in
all
this
filth
which
soaked
through
the
worn
and
broken
soles
of
their
boots
as
they
worked
the
thorns
of
the
rose
trees
caught
and
tore
their
clothing
and
lacerated
the
flesh
of
their
hands
owen
and
easton
were
working
on
ladders
doing
the
windows
immediately
above
philpot
and
harlow
sawkins
on
another
ladder
was
painting
one
of
the
gables
and
the
other
men
were
working
at
different
parts
of
the
outside
of
the
house
the
boy
bert
was
painting
the
iron
railings
of
the
front
fence
the
weather
was
bitterly
cold
the
sun
was
concealed
by
the
dreary
expanse
of
grey
cloud
that
covered
the
wintry
sky
as
they
stood
there
working
most
of
the
time
they
were
almost
perfectly
motionless
the
only
part
of
their
bodies
that
were
exercised
being
their
right
arms
the
work
they
were
now
doing
required
to
be
done
very
carefully
and
deliberately
otherwise
the
glass
would
be
up
or
the
white
paint
of
the
frames
would
into
the
dark
green
of
the
sashes
both
colours
being
wet
at
the
same
time
each
man
having
two
pots
of
paint
and
two
sets
of
brushes
the
wind
was
not
blowing
in
sudden
gusts
but
swept
by
in
a
strong
persistent
current
that
penetrated
their
clothing
and
left
them
trembling
and
numb
with
cold
it
blew
from
the
right
and
it
was
all
the
worse
on
that
account
because
the
right
arm
being
in
use
left
that
side
of
the
body
fully
exposed
they
were
able
to
keep
their
left
hands
in
their
trousers
pockets
and
the
left
arm
close
to
the
side
most
of
the
time
this
made
a
lot
of
difference
another
reason
why
it
is
worse
when
the
wind
strikes
upon
one
from
the
right
side
is
that
the
buttons
on
a
man
coat
are
always
on
the
right
side
and
consequently
the
wind
gets
underneath
philpot
realized
this
all
the
more
because
some
of
the
buttons
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
were
missing
as
they
worked
on
trembling
with
cold
and
with
their
teeth
chattering
their
faces
and
hands
became
of
that
pale
violet
colour
generally
seen
on
the
lips
of
a
corpse
their
eyes
became
full
of
water
and
the
lids
were
red
and
inflamed
philpot
and
harlow
boots
were
soon
wet
through
with
the
water
they
absorbed
from
the
damp
ground
and
their
feet
were
sore
and
intensely
painful
with
cold
their
hands
of
course
suffered
the
most
becoming
so
numbed
that
they
were
unable
to
feel
the
brushes
they
held
in
fact
presently
as
philpot
was
taking
a
dip
of
colour
the
brush
fell
from
his
hand
into
the
pot
and
then
finding
that
he
was
unable
to
move
his
fingers
he
put
his
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
to
thaw
and
began
to
walk
about
stamping
his
feet
upon
the
ground
his
example
was
quickly
followed
by
owen
easton
and
harlow
and
they
all
went
round
the
corner
to
the
sheltered
side
of
the
house
where
slyme
was
working
and
began
walking
up
and
down
rubbing
their
hands
stamping
their
feet
and
swinging
their
arms
to
warm
themselves
i
thought
nimrod
was
comin
i
put
my
overcoat
on
and
work
in
it
remarked
philpot
you
never
knows
when
to
expect
the
b
r
and
if
saw
me
in
it
it
would
mean
the
bloody
push
would
interfere
with
our
workin
if
we
did
wear
said
easton
fact
we
be
able
to
work
all
the
quicker
if
we
was
so
cold
if
misery
did
come
i
suppose
crass
would
something
to
say
if
we
did
put
on
continued
philpot
yer
could
blame
if
did
say
something
could
yer
said
slyme
offensively
would
get
into
a
row
if
came
and
saw
us
workin
in
overcoats
it
would
look
ridiclus
slyme
suffered
less
from
the
cold
than
any
of
them
not
only
because
he
had
secured
the
most
sheltered
window
but
also
because
he
was
better
clothed
than
most
of
the
rest
crass
supposed
to
be
doin
inside
asked
easton
as
he
tramped
up
and
down
with
his
shoulders
hunched
up
and
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
if
i
know
replied
philpot
about
touchin
up
or
makin
colour
he
never
does
share
of
a
job
like
this
knows
to
work
things
all
right
for
if
does
we
be
the
same
if
we
was
in
place
and
so
would
anybody
else
said
slyme
and
added
sarcastically
you
give
all
the
soft
jobs
to
other
people
and
do
all
the
rough
yerself
slyme
knew
that
although
they
were
speaking
of
crass
they
were
also
alluding
to
himself
and
as
he
replied
to
philpot
he
looked
slyly
at
owen
who
had
so
far
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
not
a
question
of
what
we
would
do
chimed
in
harlow
a
question
of
what
fair
if
it
not
fair
for
crass
to
pick
all
the
soft
jobs
for
and
leave
all
the
rough
for
others
the
fact
that
we
might
do
the
same
if
we
the
chance
do
make
it
right
one
can
be
blamed
for
doing
the
best
he
can
for
himself
under
existing
circumstances
said
owen
in
reply
to
slyme
questioning
look
that
is
the
principle
of
the
present
system
every
man
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
rest
for
my
own
part
i
do
pretend
to
practise
unselfishness
i
do
pretend
to
guide
my
actions
by
the
rules
laid
down
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
but
it
certainly
surprising
to
hear
you
who
profess
to
be
a
follower
of
christ
advocating
selfishness
or
rather
it
would
be
surprising
if
it
were
not
that
the
name
of
christian
has
ceased
to
signify
one
who
follows
christ
and
has
come
to
mean
only
liar
and
hypocrite
slyme
made
no
answer
possibly
the
fact
that
he
was
a
true
believer
enabled
him
to
bear
this
insult
with
meekness
and
humility
wonder
what
time
it
is
interposed
philpot
slyme
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nearly
ten
christ
is
that
all
growled
easton
as
they
returned
to
work
hours
more
before
dinner
only
two
more
hours
but
to
these
miserable
wretches
standing
here
in
the
bitter
wind
that
pierced
their
clothing
and
seemed
to
be
tearing
at
their
very
hearts
and
lungs
with
icy
fingers
it
appeared
like
an
eternity
to
judge
by
the
eagerness
with
which
they
longed
for
one
might
have
thought
they
had
some
glorious
banquet
to
look
forward
to
instead
of
bread
and
cheese
and
onions
or
bloaters
and
stewed
tea
two
more
hours
of
torture
before
dinner
and
three
more
hours
after
that
and
then
thank
god
it
would
be
too
dark
to
see
to
work
any
longer
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
them
if
instead
of
being
they
had
been
slaves
and
the
property
instead
of
the
hirelings
of
mr
rushton
as
it
was
he
would
not
have
cared
if
one
or
all
of
them
had
become
ill
or
died
from
the
effects
of
exposure
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
him
there
were
plenty
of
others
out
of
work
and
on
the
verge
of
starvation
who
would
be
very
glad
to
take
their
places
but
if
they
had
been
rushton
property
such
work
as
this
would
have
been
deferred
until
it
could
be
done
without
danger
to
the
health
and
lives
of
the
slaves
or
at
any
rate
even
if
it
were
proceeded
with
during
such
weather
their
owner
would
have
seen
to
it
that
they
were
properly
clothed
and
fed
he
would
have
taken
as
much
care
of
them
as
he
would
of
his
horse
people
always
take
great
care
of
their
horses
if
they
were
to
overwork
a
horse
and
make
it
ill
it
would
cost
something
for
medicine
and
the
veterinary
surgeon
to
say
nothing
of
the
animal
board
and
lodging
if
they
were
to
work
their
horses
to
death
they
would
have
to
buy
others
but
none
of
these
considerations
applies
to
workmen
if
they
work
a
man
to
death
they
can
get
another
for
nothing
at
the
corner
of
the
next
street
they
do
have
to
buy
him
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
give
him
enough
money
to
provide
him
with
food
and
clothing
of
a
kind
while
he
is
working
for
them
if
they
only
make
him
ill
they
will
not
have
to
feed
him
or
provide
him
with
medical
care
while
he
is
laid
up
he
will
either
go
without
these
things
or
pay
for
them
himself
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
workman
scores
over
both
the
horse
and
the
slave
inasmuch
as
he
enjoys
the
priceless
blessing
of
freedom
if
he
does
not
like
the
hirer
conditions
he
need
not
accept
them
he
can
refuse
to
work
and
he
can
go
and
starve
there
are
no
ropes
on
him
he
is
a
free
man
he
is
the
heir
of
all
the
ages
he
enjoys
perfect
liberty
he
has
the
right
to
choose
freely
which
he
will
do
submit
or
starve
eat
dirt
or
eat
nothing
the
wind
blew
colder
and
colder
the
sky
which
at
first
had
shown
small
patches
of
blue
through
rifts
in
the
masses
of
clouds
had
now
become
uniformly
grey
there
was
every
indication
of
an
impending
fall
of
snow
the
men
perceived
this
with
conflicting
feelings
if
it
did
commence
to
snow
they
would
not
be
able
to
continue
this
work
and
therefore
they
found
themselves
involuntarily
wishing
that
it
would
snow
or
rain
or
hail
or
anything
that
would
stop
the
work
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
weather
prevented
them
getting
on
with
the
outside
some
of
them
would
have
to
off
because
the
inside
was
practically
finished
none
of
them
wished
to
lose
any
time
if
they
could
possibly
help
it
because
there
were
only
ten
days
more
before
christmas
the
morning
slowly
wore
away
and
the
snow
did
not
fall
the
hands
worked
on
in
silence
for
they
were
in
no
mood
for
talking
and
not
only
that
but
they
were
afraid
that
hunter
or
rushton
or
crass
might
be
watching
them
from
behind
some
bush
or
tree
or
through
some
of
the
windows
this
dread
possessed
them
to
such
an
extent
that
most
of
them
were
almost
afraid
even
to
look
round
and
kept
steadily
on
at
work
none
of
them
wished
to
spoil
his
chance
of
being
kept
on
to
help
to
do
the
other
house
that
it
was
reported
rushton
were
going
to
up
for
mr
sweater
twelve
came
at
last
and
crass
whistle
had
scarcely
ceased
to
sound
before
they
all
assembled
in
the
kitchen
before
the
roaring
fire
sweater
had
sent
in
two
tons
of
coal
and
had
given
orders
that
fires
were
to
be
lit
every
day
in
nearly
every
room
to
make
the
house
habitable
by
christmas
wonder
if
it
true
as
the
firm
got
another
job
to
do
for
old
sweater
remarked
harlow
as
he
was
toasting
a
bloater
on
the
end
of
the
pointed
stick
no
said
the
man
on
the
pail
scornfully
all
bogy
you
know
that
empty
as
they
said
sweater
bought
the
one
that
rushton
and
nimrod
was
seen
lookin
at
replied
harlow
the
other
men
listened
with
evident
interest
they
was
pricing
it
up
after
all
the
landlord
of
that
is
abroad
and
there
was
some
plants
in
the
garden
as
rushton
thought
like
and
was
tellin
misery
which
ones
wanted
and
afterwards
old
pontius
pilate
came
up
with
ned
dawson
and
a
truck
they
made
two
or
three
journeys
and
took
bloody
near
everything
in
the
garden
as
was
worth
takin
what
did
go
to
rushton
place
went
to
the
disappointment
of
their
hopes
for
another
job
was
almost
forgotten
in
their
interest
in
this
story
told
you
about
it
said
harlow
dawson
it
right
enough
what
i
say
ask
ned
dawson
usually
called
mate
had
been
away
from
the
house
for
a
few
days
down
at
the
yard
doing
odd
jobs
and
had
only
come
back
to
the
that
morning
on
being
appealed
to
he
corroborated
dick
wantley
statement
be
gettin
theirselves
into
trouble
if
they
ai
careful
remarked
easton
no
they
wo
rushton
too
artful
for
that
it
seems
the
agent
is
a
pal
of
and
they
worked
it
between
a
bloody
cheek
though
exclaimed
harlow
that
nothing
to
some
of
the
things
i
known
do
before
now
said
the
man
on
the
pail
do
you
remember
back
in
the
summer
that
carved
hoak
hall
table
as
rushton
pinched
out
of
that
on
grand
parade
that
was
a
bit
of
all
right
too
was
it
cried
philpot
and
several
of
the
others
laughed
know
that
big
we
did
up
last
summer
no
wantley
continued
for
the
benefit
of
those
not
the
know
it
bin
empty
for
a
long
time
and
we
found
this
table
in
a
cupboard
under
the
stairs
a
bloody
fine
table
it
was
too
one
of
them
bracket
tables
what
you
fix
to
the
wall
without
no
legs
it
a
marble
top
to
it
and
underneath
was
a
carved
hoak
figger
a
mermaid
with
arms
up
over
up
the
table
top
something
splendid
the
man
on
the
pail
waxed
enthusiastic
as
he
thought
of
it
been
worth
at
least
five
quid
well
just
as
we
pulled
this
table
out
who
should
come
in
but
rushton
and
when
seen
it
tells
crass
to
cover
it
over
with
a
sack
and
not
to
let
nobody
see
it
and
then
clears
orf
to
the
shop
and
sends
the
boy
down
with
the
truck
and
it
took
up
to
own
and
it
there
now
fixed
in
the
front
i
was
sent
up
there
a
couple
of
months
ago
to
paint
and
varnish
the
lobby
doors
and
i
seen
it
meself
there
a
pitcher
called
the
day
of
judgement
on
the
wall
just
over
it
thunder
and
lightning
and
earthquakes
and
corpses
gettin
up
out
o
their
graves
something
bloody
and
underneath
the
picture
is
a
card
with
a
tex
out
of
the
bible
christ
is
the
of
this
the
unknown
guest
at
every
meal
the
silent
listener
to
every
conversation
i
was
workin
there
for
three
or
four
days
and
i
got
to
know
it
orf
by
that
takes
the
biskit
do
it
said
philpot
but
the
best
of
it
was
the
man
on
the
pail
proceeded
best
of
it
was
when
ole
misery
about
the
table
was
so
bloody
wild
because
did
get
it
that
went
upstairs
and
pinched
one
of
the
venetian
blinds
and
it
took
up
to
own
by
the
boy
and
a
few
days
arterwards
one
of
the
carpenters
to
go
and
fix
it
up
in
bedroom
was
it
never
found
out
inquired
easton
there
was
a
bit
of
talk
about
it
the
agent
wanted
to
know
where
it
was
but
pontius
pilate
swore
black
and
white
as
there
been
no
blind
in
that
room
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
firm
got
the
order
to
supply
a
new
one
i
ca
understand
is
who
did
the
table
belong
to
said
harlow
was
a
fixture
belongin
to
the
replied
wantley
i
suppose
the
former
tenants
had
some
piece
of
furniture
of
their
own
that
they
wanted
to
put
in
the
where
this
table
was
fixed
so
they
took
it
down
and
stored
it
away
in
this
cupboard
and
when
they
left
the
i
suppose
they
did
trouble
to
put
it
back
again
anyway
there
was
the
mark
on
the
wall
where
it
used
to
be
fixed
but
when
we
did
the
staircase
down
the
place
was
papered
over
and
i
suppose
the
landlord
or
the
agent
never
give
the
table
a
thought
anyhow
rushton
got
away
with
it
all
right
a
number
of
similar
stories
were
related
by
several
others
concerning
the
doings
of
different
employers
they
had
worked
for
but
after
a
time
the
conversation
reverted
to
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
the
impending
slaughter
and
the
improbability
of
being
able
to
obtain
another
job
considering
the
large
number
of
men
who
were
already
out
of
employment
ca
make
it
out
myself
remarked
easton
seems
to
get
worse
every
year
there
do
seem
to
be
the
work
about
that
there
used
to
be
and
even
what
there
is
is
messed
up
anyhow
as
if
the
people
who
it
done
ca
afford
to
pay
for
it
said
harlow
true
enough
why
just
look
at
the
work
that
in
one
o
them
on
the
grand
parade
people
must
more
money
to
spend
in
those
days
you
know
all
those
massive
curtain
cornishes
over
the
and
winders
gilded
solid
why
nowadays
they
want
all
the
bloody
done
down
right
through
inside
and
out
for
the
money
it
cost
to
gild
one
of
them
seems
that
nearly
everybody
is
more
or
less
up
nowadays
said
philpot
jiggered
if
i
can
understand
it
but
there
it
is
should
ast
owen
to
explain
it
to
yer
remarked
crass
with
a
jeering
laugh
knows
all
about
wot
the
cause
of
poverty
but
wo
tell
nobody
been
goin
to
tell
us
wot
it
is
for
a
long
time
past
but
it
do
seem
to
come
orf
crass
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
producing
the
obscurer
cutting
and
he
made
this
remark
in
the
hope
of
turning
the
conversation
into
a
channel
that
would
enable
him
to
do
so
but
owen
did
not
respond
and
went
on
reading
his
newspaper
ai
no
lectures
at
all
lately
we
said
harlow
in
an
injured
tone
think
it
about
time
owen
explained
what
the
real
cause
of
poverty
is
i
beginning
to
get
anxious
about
it
the
others
laughed
when
philpot
had
finished
eating
his
dinner
he
went
out
of
the
kitchen
and
presently
returned
with
a
small
pair
of
steps
which
he
opened
and
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
the
back
of
the
steps
facing
the
audience
you
are
me
son
he
exclaimed
to
owen
a
pulpit
for
yer
come
on
cried
crass
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
for
the
cutting
us
wot
the
real
cause
of
poverty
shouted
the
man
on
the
pail
up
into
the
bloody
pulpit
and
give
us
a
sermon
as
owen
made
no
response
to
the
invitations
the
crowd
began
to
hoot
and
groan
on
man
whispered
philpot
winking
his
goggle
eye
persuasively
at
owen
on
just
for
a
bit
of
turn
to
pass
the
time
away
owen
accordingly
ascended
the
steps
much
to
the
secret
delight
of
crass
and
was
immediately
greeted
with
a
round
of
enthusiastic
applause
you
are
you
see
said
philpot
addressing
the
meeting
no
use
booin
and
threatenin
because
one
of
them
lecturers
wot
can
honly
be
managed
with
kindness
if
it
a
bin
for
me
would
agreed
to
speak
at
all
philpot
having
been
unanimously
elected
chairman
proposed
by
harlow
and
seconded
by
the
man
on
the
pail
owen
commenced
chairman
and
gentlemen
as
i
am
to
public
speaking
it
is
with
some
degree
of
hesitation
that
i
venture
to
address
myself
to
such
a
large
distinguished
fashionable
and
intelligent
looking
audience
as
that
which
i
have
the
honour
of
seeing
before
me
on
the
present
occasion
applause
of
the
finest
speakers
i
ever
remarked
the
man
on
the
pail
in
a
loud
whisper
to
the
chairman
who
motioned
him
to
be
silent
owen
continued
some
of
my
previous
lectures
i
have
endeavoured
to
convince
you
that
money
is
in
itself
of
no
value
and
of
no
real
use
whatever
in
this
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
rather
unsuccessful
a
bit
of
it
mate
cried
crass
sarcastically
all
agrees
with
it
shouted
easton
a
bloke
was
to
come
in
now
and
orfer
to
give
me
a
quid
i
refuse
it
would
i
said
philpot
whether
you
agree
or
not
the
fact
remains
a
man
might
possess
so
much
money
that
in
england
he
would
be
comparatively
rich
and
yet
if
he
went
to
some
country
where
the
cost
of
living
is
very
high
he
would
find
himself
in
a
condition
of
poverty
or
one
might
conceivably
be
in
a
place
where
the
necessaries
of
life
could
not
be
bought
for
money
at
all
therefore
it
is
more
conducive
to
an
intelligent
understanding
of
the
subject
if
we
say
that
to
be
rich
consists
not
necessarily
in
having
much
money
but
in
being
able
to
enjoy
an
abundance
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
and
that
poverty
consists
not
merely
in
being
without
money
but
in
being
short
of
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
or
in
other
words
in
being
short
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
the
things
that
are
all
without
exception
produced
by
work
whether
you
agree
or
not
with
anything
else
that
i
say
you
will
all
admit
that
that
is
our
condition
at
the
present
time
we
do
not
enjoy
a
full
share
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
we
are
all
in
a
state
of
more
or
less
abject
poverty
cried
crass
and
there
were
loud
murmurs
of
indignant
dissent
from
several
quarters
as
owen
proceeded
does
it
happen
that
we
are
so
short
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
reason
why
we
short
of
the
things
that
made
by
work
interrupted
crass
mimicking
owen
manner
that
we
ai
got
the
bloody
money
to
buy
said
the
man
on
the
pail
as
i
said
before
if
all
the
money
in
the
country
was
shared
out
equal
today
according
to
ideas
in
six
months
time
it
would
be
all
back
again
in
the
same
as
it
is
now
and
what
are
you
goin
to
do
then
again
of
course
this
answer
came
derisively
from
several
places
at
the
same
instant
and
then
they
all
began
speaking
at
once
vying
with
each
other
in
ridiculing
the
foolishness
of
there
socialists
whom
they
called
sharers
out
barrington
was
almost
the
only
one
who
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
he
was
seated
in
his
customary
place
and
as
usual
silently
smoking
apparently
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
never
said
anything
about
sharing
out
all
the
money
said
owen
during
a
lull
in
the
storm
i
do
know
of
any
socialist
who
advocates
anything
of
the
kind
can
any
of
you
tell
me
the
name
of
someone
who
proposes
to
do
so
no
one
answered
as
owen
repeated
his
inquiry
this
time
addressing
himself
directly
to
crass
who
had
been
one
of
the
loudest
in
denouncing
and
ridiculing
the
out
thus
cornered
crass
who
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
subject
for
a
few
moments
looked
rather
foolish
then
he
began
to
talk
in
a
very
loud
voice
it
a
fact
everybody
knows
that
what
they
wants
but
they
take
bloody
good
care
they
do
act
up
to
it
theirselves
though
look
at
them
there
labour
members
of
parliament
a
lot
of
b
rs
what
too
bloody
lazy
to
work
for
their
livin
what
the
bloody
was
they
before
they
got
there
only
workin
men
the
same
as
you
and
me
but
they
got
the
gift
o
the
gab
and
we
know
all
about
that
said
owen
what
i
asking
you
is
to
tell
us
who
advocates
taking
all
the
money
in
the
country
and
sharing
it
out
equally
i
say
that
everybody
knows
that
what
they
after
shouted
crass
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
a
fine
thing
he
added
indignantly
to
that
idear
a
bloody
scavenger
or
a
farm
labourer
ought
to
get
as
much
wages
as
you
or
me
can
talk
about
that
some
other
time
what
i
want
to
know
at
present
is
what
authority
have
you
for
saying
that
socialists
believe
in
sharing
out
all
the
money
equally
amongst
all
the
people
that
what
i
always
understood
they
believed
in
doing
said
crass
rather
lamely
a
fact
said
several
others
to
think
of
it
continued
crass
as
he
drew
the
obscurer
cutting
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
got
a
little
thing
that
i
been
goin
to
read
to
yer
it
out
of
the
obscurer
i
forgotten
all
about
it
remarking
that
the
print
was
too
small
for
his
own
eyes
he
passed
the
slip
of
paper
to
harlow
who
read
aloud
as
follows
prove
your
principles
or
look
at
both
sides
wish
i
could
open
your
eyes
to
the
true
misery
of
our
condition
injustice
tyranny
and
oppression
said
a
discontented
hack
to
a
cob
as
they
stood
side
by
side
in
unhired
cabs
rather
have
them
opened
to
something
pleasant
thank
you
replied
the
cob
am
sorry
for
you
if
you
could
enter
into
the
noble
aspirations
the
hack
began
plain
what
would
you
have
said
the
cob
interrupting
him
would
i
have
why
equality
and
share
and
share
alike
all
over
the
world
said
the
hack
mean
that
said
the
cob
course
i
do
what
right
have
those
sleek
pampered
hunters
and
racers
to
their
warm
stables
and
high
feed
their
grooms
and
jockeys
it
is
really
to
think
of
it
replied
the
hack
do
know
but
you
may
be
right
said
the
cob
to
show
i
in
earnest
as
no
doubt
you
are
let
me
have
half
the
good
beans
you
have
in
your
bag
and
you
shall
have
half
the
musty
oats
and
chaff
i
have
in
mine
there
nothing
like
proving
principles
original
parables
by
mrs
prosier
you
are
cried
several
voices
does
that
mean
cried
crass
triumphantly
do
you
go
and
share
your
wages
with
the
chaps
what
out
of
work
does
it
mean
replied
owen
contemptuously
means
that
if
the
editor
of
the
obscurer
put
that
in
his
paper
as
an
argument
against
socialism
either
he
is
of
feeble
intellect
himself
or
else
he
thinks
that
the
majority
of
his
readers
are
that
is
an
argument
against
socialism
it
an
argument
against
the
hypocrites
who
pretend
to
be
christians
the
people
who
profess
to
love
their
neighbours
as
themselves
who
pretend
to
believe
in
universal
brotherhood
and
that
they
do
not
love
the
world
or
the
things
of
the
world
and
say
that
they
are
merely
pilgrims
on
their
way
to
a
better
land
as
for
why
i
do
do
it
why
should
i
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
christian
but
you
all
christians
why
do
you
do
it
not
talkin
about
religion
exclaimed
crass
impatiently
what
are
you
talking
about
i
never
said
anything
about
sharing
out
or
bearing
one
another
burdens
i
do
profess
to
give
to
everyone
who
asks
of
me
or
to
give
my
cloak
to
the
man
who
take
away
my
coat
i
have
read
that
christ
taught
that
his
followers
must
do
all
these
things
but
as
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
one
of
his
followers
i
do
do
them
but
you
believe
in
christianity
why
do
you
do
the
things
that
he
said
as
nobody
seemed
to
know
the
answer
to
this
question
the
lecturer
proceeded
this
matter
the
difference
between
christians
and
socialists
is
this
christ
taught
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
men
those
who
today
pretend
to
be
christ
followers
hypocritically
profess
to
carry
out
those
teachings
now
but
they
do
they
have
arranged
the
battle
of
life
system
instead
socialist
very
much
against
his
will
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
this
horrible
battle
and
he
appeals
to
the
other
combatants
to
cease
from
fighting
and
to
establish
a
system
of
brotherly
love
and
mutual
helpfulness
but
he
does
not
hypocritically
pretend
to
practise
brotherly
love
towards
those
who
will
not
agree
to
his
appeal
and
who
compel
him
to
fight
with
them
for
his
very
life
he
knows
that
in
this
battle
he
must
either
fight
or
go
under
therefore
in
he
fights
but
all
the
time
he
continues
his
appeal
for
the
cessation
of
the
slaughter
he
pleads
for
the
changing
of
the
system
he
advocates
instead
of
competition
but
how
can
he
with
people
who
insist
on
competing
with
him
no
individual
can
practise
by
himself
socialism
can
only
be
practised
by
the
community
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
at
present
the
other
members
of
the
community
the
christians
deride
and
oppose
the
socialist
appeal
is
these
pretended
christians
who
do
not
practise
what
they
preach
because
all
the
time
they
are
singing
their
songs
of
brotherhood
and
love
they
are
fighting
with
each
other
and
strangling
each
other
and
trampling
each
other
underfoot
in
their
horrible
battle
of
life
socialist
suggests
sharing
out
money
or
anything
else
in
the
manner
you
say
and
another
thing
if
you
only
had
a
little
more
sense
you
might
be
able
to
perceive
that
this
stock
argument
of
yours
is
really
an
argument
against
the
present
system
inasmuch
as
it
proves
that
money
is
in
itself
of
no
use
whatever
supposing
all
the
money
was
shared
out
equally
and
suppose
there
was
enough
of
it
for
everyone
to
have
ten
thousand
pounds
and
suppose
they
then
all
thought
they
were
rich
and
none
of
them
would
work
what
would
they
live
on
their
money
could
they
eat
it
or
drink
it
or
wear
it
it
would
take
them
very
long
to
find
out
that
this
wonderful
money
which
under
the
present
system
is
the
most
powerful
thing
in
existence
is
really
of
no
more
use
than
so
much
dirt
they
would
speedily
perish
not
from
lack
of
money
but
from
lack
of
wealth
that
is
from
lack
of
things
that
are
made
by
work
and
further
it
is
quite
true
that
if
all
the
money
were
distributed
equally
amongst
all
the
people
tomorrow
it
would
all
be
up
in
heaps
again
in
a
very
short
time
but
that
only
proves
that
while
the
present
money
system
remains
it
will
be
impossible
to
do
away
with
poverty
for
heaps
in
some
places
mean
little
or
nothing
in
other
places
therefore
while
the
money
system
lasts
we
are
bound
to
have
poverty
and
all
the
evils
it
brings
in
its
train
of
course

the

on

the

one

did
not

nervous
perhaps
he
felt
safer

was

surrounded

materials
by
those
who
work
aided
by
machinery
when
we
inquire
into
the
cause
of
the
present
shortage
of
these
things
the
first
question
we
should
ask
is
are
there
not
sufficient
of
the
raw
materials
in
existence
to
enable
us
to
produce
enough
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
all
answer
to
this
question
is
there
are
undoubtedly
more
than
sufficient
of
all
the
raw
materials
of
raw
material
is
therefore
not
the
cause
we
must
look
in
another
direction
next
question
is
are
we
short
of
labour
is
there
not
a
sufficient
number
of
people
able
and
willing
to
work
or
is
there
not
enough
machinery
answers
to
these
questions
are
there
are
plenty
of
people
able
and
willing
to
work
and
there
is
plenty
of
machinery
things
being
so
how
comes
this
extraordinary
result
how
is
it
that
the
benefits
of
civilization
are
not
produced
in
sufficient
quantity
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
all
how
is
it
that
the
majority
of
the
people
always
have
to
go
without
most
of
the
refinements
comforts
and
pleasures
of
life
and
very
often
without
even
the
bare
necessaries
of
existence
of
materials
plenty
of
labour
plenty
of
machinery
and
nearly
everybody
going
short
of
nearly
everything
cause
of
this
extraordinary
state
of
affairs
is
that
although
we
possess
the
means
of
producing
more
than
abundance
for
all
we
also
have
an
imbecile
system
of
managing
our
affairs
present
money
system
prevents
us
from
doing
the
necessary
work
and
consequently
causes
the
majority
of
the
population
to
go
short
of
the
things
that
can
be
made
by
work
they
suffer
want
in
the
midst
of
the
means
of
producing
abundance
they
remain
idle
because
they
are
bound
and
fettered
with
a
chain
of
gold
us
examine
the
details
of
this
insane
idiotic
imbecile
system
owen
now
asked
philpot
to
pass
him
a
piece
of
charred
wood
from
under
the
grate
and
having
obtained
what
he
wanted
he
drew
upon
the
wall
a
quadrangular
figure
about
four
feet
in
length
and
one
foot
deep
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
had
not
yet
been
cleaned
off
so
it
did
not
matter
about
disfiguring
them
this
represents
the
whole
of
the
adult
population
of
the
country
find
out
the
cause
of
the
shortage
in
this
country
of
the
things
that
can
be
made
by
work
it
is
first
of
all
necessary
to
find
out
how
people
spend
their
time
now
this
square
represents
the
whole
of
the
adult
population
of
this
country
there
are
many
different
classes
of
people
engaged
in
a
great
number
of
different
occupations
some
of
them
are
helping
to
produce
the
benefits
of
civilization
and
some
are
not
all
these
people
help
to
consume
these
things
but
when
we
inquire
into
their
occupations
we
shall
find
that
although
the
majority
are
workers
only
a
comparatively
small
number
are
engaged
in
actually
producing
either
the
benefits
of
civilization
or
the
necessaries
of
order
being
once
more
restored
the
lecturer
turned
again
to
the
drawing
on
the
wall
and
stretched
out
his
hand
evidently
with
the
intention
of
making
some
addition
to
it
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
paused
irresolutely
and
faltering
let
his
arm
drop
down
again
by
his
side
an
absolute
disconcerting
silence
reigned
his
embarrassment
and
nervousness
increased
he
knew
that
they
were
unwilling
to
hear
or
talk
or
think
about
such
subjects
as
the
cause
of
poverty
at
all
they
preferred
to
make
fun
of
and
ridicule
them
he
knew
they
would
refuse
to
try
to
see
the
meaning
of
what
he
wished
to
say
if
it
were
at
all
difficult
or
obscure
how
was
he
to
put
it
to
them
so
that
they
would
have
to
understand
it
whether
they
wished
to
or
not
it
was
almost
impossible
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
convince
them
if
they
would
only
take
a
little
trouble
and
try
to
understand
but
he
knew
that
they
certainly
would
not
themselves
about
such
a
subject
as
this
it
was
not
as
if
it
were
some
really
important
matter
such
as
a
smutty
story
a
game
of
hooks
and
rings
or
something
concerning
football
or
cricket
or
the
doings
of
some
royal
personage
or
aristocrat
the
problem
of
the
cause
of
poverty
was
only
something
that
concerned
their
own
and
their
children
future
welfare
such
an
unimportant
matter
being
undeserving
of
any
earnest
attention
must
be
put
before
them
so
clearly
and
plainly
that
they
would
be
compelled
to
understand
it
at
a
glance
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
do
it
observing
his
hesitation
some
of
the
men
began
to
snigger
seems
to
got
into
a
bit
of
a
fog
remarked
crass
in
a
loud
whisper
to
slyme
who
laughed
the
sound
roused
owen
who
resumed
these
people

to
consume
the
things
produced
by
labour
we
will
now
divide
them
into
separate
classes
those
who
help
to
produce
those
who
do
nothing
those
who
do
harm
and
those
who
are
engaged
in
unnecessary
work
sneered
crass
who
are
engaged
in
unnecessary
talk
we
will
separate
those
who
not
only
do
nothing
but
do
not
even
pretend
to
be
of
any
use
people
who
would
consider
themselves
disgraced
if
they
by
any
chance
did
any
useful
work
this
class
includes
tramps
beggars
the
aristocracy

great
landowners
and
generally
all
those
possessed

stands
for

work
that
is
producing
things
or
doing
things
which
though
useful
and
necessary
to
the
imbecile
system
can
not
be
described
as
the
necessaries
of
life
or
the
benefits
of

this
is
the
largest
section
of
all
it
comprises
commercial
travellers

agents
the
great
number
of

the

of
clerks
workmen
employed
in
the
construction

adornment
of
business
premises
people
occupied
with
what
they
call
business
which
means
being
very
busy
without
producing
anything
then
there
is
a
vast
army
of
people
engaged
in
designing
composing
painting
or
printing
advertisements
things
which
are
for
the
most
part
of
no
utility
whatever
the
object
of
most
advertisements
is
merely
to
persuade
people
to
buy
from
one
firm
rather
than
from
another

during
the
delivery
of
this
pert
of
the
lecture
the
audience
began
to
manifest
symptoms
of
impatience
and
dissent
perceiving
this
owen
speaking
very
rapidly
continued
you
go
down
town
you
will
see
half
a
dozen
drapers
shops
within
a
of
each
other
often
even
next
door
to
each
other
all
selling
the
same
things
you
ca
possibly
think
that
all
those
shops
are
really
necessary
you
know
that
one
of
them
would
serve
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
all
intended
to
store
and
serve
as
a
centre
for
the
distribution
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
if
you
will
admit
that
five
out
of
the
six
shops
are
not
really
necessary
you
must
also
admit
that
the
men
who
built
them
and
the
salesmen
and
women
or
other
assistants
engaged
in
them
and
the
men
who
design
and
write
and
print
their
advertisements
are
all
doing
unnecessary
work
all
really
wasting
their
time
and
labour
time
and
labour
that
might
be
employed
in
helping
to
produce
these
things
that
we
are
at
present
short
of
you
must
admit
that
none
of
these
people
are
engaged
in
producing
either
the
necessaries
of
life
or
the
benefits
of
civilization
they
buy
them
and
sell
them
and
handle
them
and
haggle
over
them
and
display
them
in
the
plate
glass
windows
of
stores
and
emporiums
and
make
profit
out
of
them
and
use
them
but
these
people
themselves
produce
nothing
that
is
necessary
to
life
or
happiness
and
the
things
that
some
of
them
do
produce
are
only
necessary
to
the
present
imbecile
system
the
sort
of
a
bloody
system
do
you
think
we
ought
to
then
interrupted
the
man
on
the
pail
you
very
good
at
finding
fault
sneered
slyme
why
you
tell
us
it
all
going
to
be
put
right
that
not
what
we
talking
about
now
is
it
replied
owen
present
we
only
trying
to
find
out
how
it
is
that
there
is
not
sufficient
produced
for
everyone
to
have
enough
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
although
most
of
the
people
in
number
three
work
very
hard
they
produce
nothing
is
a
lot
of
bloody
rot
exclaimed
crass
impatiently
if
there
is
more
shops
than
what
actually
necessary
cried
harlow
all
helps
people
to
get
a
livin
if
half
of
was
shut
up
it
would
just
mean
that
all
them
what
works
there
would
be
out
of
a
job
live
and
let
live
i
say
all
these
things
makes
work
shouted
the
man
behind
the
moat
i
know
it
makes
work
replied
owen
we
ca
live
on
mere
work
you
know
to
live
in
comfort
we
need
a
sufficiency
of
the
things
that
can
be
made
by
work
a
man
might
work
very
hard
and
yet
be
wasting
his
time
if
he
were
not
producing
something
necessary
or
useful
are
there
so
many
shops
and
stores
and
emporiums
do
you
imagine
they
exist
for
the
purpose
of
giving
those
who
build
them
or
work
in
them
a
chance
to
earn
a
living
nothing
of
the
sort
they
are
carried
on
and
exorbitant
prices
are
charged
for
the
articles
they
sell
to
enable
the
proprietors
to
amass
fortunes
and
to
pay
extortionate
rents
to
the
landlords
that
is
why
the
wages
and
salaries
of
nearly
all
those
who
do
the
work
created
by
these
businesses
are
cut
down
to
the
lowest
possible
point
knows
all
about
that
said
crass
you
ca
get
away
from
it
that
all
these
things
makes
work
and
that
what
we
wants
plenty
of
work
cries
of
and
expressions
of
dissent
from
the
views
expressed
by
the
lecturer
resounded
through
the
room
nearly
everyone
speaking
at
the
same
time
after
a
while
when
the
row
had
in
some
measure
subsided
owen
resumed
has
not
provided
all
the
things
necessary
for
the
life
and
happiness
of
mankind
in
order
to
obtain
these
things
we
have
to
work
the
only
rational
labour
is
that
which
is
directed
to
the
creation
of
those
things
any
kind
of
work
which
does
not
help
us
to
attain
this
object
is
a
ridiculous
idiotic
criminal
imbecile
waste
of
time
is
what
the
great
army
of
people
represented
by
division
number
three
are
doing
at
present
they
are
all
very
busy
working
very
hard
but
to
all
useful
intents
and
purposes
they
are
doing
nothing
all
right
said
harlow
it
yer
own
way
but
there
no
need
to
keep
on
repeating
the
same
thing
over
an
over
again
next
division
resumed
owen
for
those
who
are
engaged
in
really
useful
work
the
production
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
the
necessaries
refinements
and
comforts
of
life

shouted
philpot
leading
off
a
cheer
which
was
taken
up
enthusiastically
by
the
crowd
this
is
where
we
comes
in
he
added
nodding
his
head
and
winking
his
goggle
eyes
at
the
meeting
wish
to
call
the
chairman
to
horder
said
the
man
on
the
pail
when
owen
had
finished
writing
in
the
list
of
occupations
several
members
of
the
audience
rose
to
point
out
that
those
engaged
in
the
production
of
beer
had
been
omitted
owen
rectified
this
serious
oversight
and
proceeded
most
of
the
people
in
number
four
are
out
of
work
at
least
one
quarter
of
their
time
we
must
reduce
the
size
of
this
division
by
one
fourth
so
the
grey
part
represents
the
unemployed
some
of
those
in
number
three
are
often
unemployed
as
well
said
harlow
yes
but
as
they
produce
nothing
even
when
they
are
at
work
we
need
not
trouble
to
classify
them
unemployed
because
our
present
purpose
is
only
to
discover
the
reason
why
there
is
not
enough
produced
for
everyone
to
enjoy
abundance
and
this
the
present
system
of
conducting
our
affairs
is
the
reason
of
the
shortage
the
cause
of
poverty
when
you
reflect
that
all
the
other
people
are
devouring
the
things
produced
by
those
in
number
four
can
you
wonder
that
there
is
not
plenty
for
all
devouring
is
a
good
word
said
philpot
and
the
others
laughed
the
lecturer
now
drew
a
small
square
upon
the
wall
below
the
other
drawing
this
square
he
filled
in
solid
black
tramps

this
represents
the
total
of

produced

the

in

represents
the
total
amount
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
and
necessaries
of
life
produced
by
the
people
in
number
four
we
now
proceed
to
share
out
the
things
in
the
same
way
as
they
are
actually
divided
amongst
the
different
classes
of
the
population
under
the
present
imbecile
system
the
people
in
divisions
one
and
two
are
universally
considered
to
be
the
most
worthy
and
deserving
we
give
them
of
the
whole
remainder
we
give
to
be
shared
out
amongst

how
the
things
produced
by
the
people
in
division
are
out
amongst
the
different
classes
of
the
population
you
must
run
away
with
the
idea
that
the
people
in
three
and
four
take
their
share
quietly
and
divide
the
things
equally
between
them
not
at
all
some
get
very
little
some
none
some
more
than
a
fair
share
it
is
in
these
two
divisions
that
the
ferocious
battle
of
life
rages
most
fiercely
and
of
course
in
this
battle
the
weak
and
the
virtuous
fare
the
worst
even
those
whose
exceptional
abilities
or
opportunities
enable
them
to
succeed
are
compelled
to
practise
selfishness
because
a
man
of
exceptional
ability
who
was
not
selfish
would
devote
his
abilities
to
relieving
the
manifest
sufferings
of
others
and
not
to
his
own
profit
and
if
he
did
the
former
he
would
not
be
successful
in
the
sense
that
the
world
understands
the
word
all
those
who
really
seek
to
love
their
neighbour
as
themselves
or
to
return
good
for
evil
the
gentle
the
kind
and
all
those
who
refrain
from
doing
to
others
the
things
they
would
not
like
to
suffer
themselves
all
these
are
of
necessity
found
amongst
the
vanquished
because
only
the
worst
only
those
who
are
aggressive
cunning
selfish
and
mean
are
fitted
to
survive
and
all
these
people
in
numbers
three
and
four
are
so
fully
occupied
in
this
dreadful
struggle
to
secure
a
little
that
but
few
of
them
pause
to
inquire
why
there
are
not
more
of
the
things
they
are
fighting
for
or
why
it
is
necessary
to
fight
like
this
at
all
for
a
few
minutes
silence
prevailed
each
man
mind
being
busy
trying
to
think
of
some
objection
to
the
lecturer
arguments
could
the
small
number
of
people
in
number
one
and
two
consume
as
much
as
you
given
in
your
drorin
demanded
crass
do
actually
consume
all
of
it
replied
owen
of
it
is
wantonly
wasted
they
also
make
fortunes
by
selling
some
of
it
in
foreign
countries
but
they
consume
a
great
part
of
it
themselves
because
the
amount
of
labour
expended
on
the
things
enjoyed
by
these
people
is
greater
than
that
expended
in
the
production
of
the
things
used
by
the
workers
most
of
the
people
who
do
nothing
get
the
best
of
everything
more
than
of
the
time
of
the
working
classes
is
spent
in
producing
the
things
used
by
the
wealthy
compare
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
clothing
possessed
by
the
wife
or
daughter
of
a
rich
man
with
that
of
the
wife
or
daughter
of
a
worker
the
time
and
labour
spent
on
producing
the
one
is
twenty
times
greater
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
and
it
the
same
with
everything
else
their
homes
their
clothing
boots
hats
jewellery
and
their
food
everything
must
be
of
the
very
best
that
art
or
long
and
painful
labour
can
produce
but
for
most
of
those
whose
labour
produces
all
these
good
things
anything
is
considered
good
enough
for
themselves
the
philanthropic
workers
manufacture
shoddy
cloth
that
is
cheap
cloth
made
of
old
rags
and
dirt
and
shoddy
uncomfortable
ironclad
boots
if
you
see
a
workman
wearing
a
really
good
suit
of
clothes
you
may
safely
conclude
that
he
is
either
leading
an
unnatural
life
that
is
he
is
not
married
or
that
he
has
obtained
it
from
a
tallyman
on
the
hire
system
and
has
not
yet
paid
for
it
or
that
it
is
someone
suit
that
he
has
bought
or
had
given
to
him
by
some
charitable
person
it
the
same
with
the
food
all
the
ducks
and
geese
pheasants
partridges
and
all
the
very
best
parts
of
the
very
best
meat
all
the
soles
and
the
finest
plaice
and
salmon
and
trout
chuck
it
cried
harlow
fiercely
do
want
to
no
more
of
it
and
several
others
protested
against
the
lecturer
wasting
time
on
such
mere
all
the
very
best
of
everything
is
reserved
exclusively
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
people
in
divisions
one
and
two
while
the
workers
subsist
on
block
ornaments
margarine
adulterated
tea
mysterious
beer
and
are
content
only
grumbling
when
they
are
unable
to
obtain
even
such
fare
as
this
owen
paused
and
a
gloomy
silence
followed
but
suddenly
crass
brightened
up
he
detected
a
serious
flaw
in
the
lecturer
argument
say
the
people
in
one
and
two
gets
all
the
best
of
everything
but
what
about
the
tramps
and
beggars
you
got
them
in
division
one
i
know
you
see
that
the
proper
place
for
them
they
belong
to
a
loafer
class
they
are
no
better
mentally
or
morally
than
any
of
the
other
loafers
in
that
division
neither
are
they
of
any
more
use
of
course
when
we
consider
them
in
relation
to
the
amount
they
consume
of
the
things
produced
by
others
they
are
not
so
harmful
as
the
other
loafers
because
they
consume
comparatively
little
but
all
the
same
they
are
in
their
right
place
in
that
division
all
those
people
get
the
same
share
the
section
represents
not
individuals
but
the
loafer
class
i
thought
you
said
you
was
goin
to
prove
that
money
was
the
cause
of
poverty
said
easton
it
is
said
owen
you
see
that
it
money
that
caused
all
these
people
to
lose
sight
of
the
true
purpose
of
labour
the
production
of
the
things
we
need
all
these
people
are
suffering
from
the
delusion
that
it
does
matter
what
kind
of
work
they
do
or
whether
they
merely
do
nothing
so
long
as
they
get
money
for
doing
it
under
the
present
extraordinary
system
that
the
only
object
they
have
in
view
to
get
money
their
ideas
are
so
that
they
regard
with
contempt
those
who
are
engaged
in
useful
work
with
the
exception
of
criminals
and
the
poorer
sort
of
loafers
the
working
classes
are
considered
to
be
the
lowest
and
least
worthy
in
the
community
those
who
manage
to
get
money
for
doing
something
other
than
productive
work
are
considered
more
worthy
of
respect
on
that
account
those
who
do
nothing
themselves
but
get
money
out
of
the
labour
of
others
are
regarded
as
being
more
worthy
still
but
the
ones
who
are
esteemed
most
of
all
and
honoured
above
all
the
rest
are
those
who
obtain
money
for
doing
absolutely
nothing
i
ca
see
as
that
proves
that
money
is
the
cause
of
poverty
said
easton
here
said
owen
people
in
number
four
produce
everything
do
they
we
knows
all
about
that
interrupted
harlow
they
gets
paid
for
it
do
they
they
gets
their
wages
and
what
does
their
wages
consist
of
said
owen
money
of
course
replied
harlow
impatiently
and
what
do
they
do
with
their
money
when
they
get
it
do
they
eat
it
or
drink
it
or
wear
it
at
this
apparently
absurd
question
several
of
those
who
had
hitherto
been
attentive
listeners
laughed
derisively
it
was
really
very
difficult
to
listen
patiently
to
such
nonsense
course
they
do
answered
harlow
scornfully
buy
the
things
they
want
with
it
you
think
that
most
of
them
manage
to
save
a
part
of
their
wages
put
it
away
in
the
bank
i
can
speak
for
meself
replied
harlow
amid
laughter
takes
me
all
my
bloody
time
to
pay
my
rent
and
other
expenses
and
to
keep
my
little
lot
in
shoe
leather
and
it
dam
little
i
spend
on
beer
a
tanner
or
a
bob
a
week
at
the
most
single
man
can
save
money
if
he
likes
said
slyme
not
speaking
of
single
men
replied
owen
referring
to
those
who
live
natural
lives
about
all
the
money
what
in
the
post
office
savings
bank
and
building
and
friendly
societies
said
crass
very
large
part
of
that
belongs
to
people
who
are
in
business
or
who
have
some
other
source
of
income
than
their
own
wages
there
are
some
exceptionally
fortunate
workers
who
happen
to
have
good
situations
and
higher
wages
than
the
ordinary
run
of
workmen
then
there
are
some
who
are
so
placed
by
letting
lodgings
for
instance
that
they
are
able
to
live
rent
free
others
whose
wives
go
out
to
work
and
others
again
who
have
exceptional
jobs
and
work
a
lot
of
overtime
but
these
are
all
exceptional
cases
say
as
no
married
workin
man
can
save
any
money
at
all
shouted
harlow
unless
goes
without
some
of
even
the
few
things
we
are
able
to
get
and
makes
wife
and
kids
go
without
as
well
said
everybody
except
crass
and
slyme
who
were
both
thrifty
working
men
and
each
of
them
had
some
money
saved
in
one
or
other
of
the
institutions
mentioned
that
means
said
owen
means
that
the
wages
the
people
in
division
four
receive
is
not
equivalent
to
the
work
they
do
mean
equivalent
cried
crass
the
do
yer
talk
plain
english
without
draggin
in
a
lot
of
long
words
wot
nobody
understand
mean
this
replied
owen
speaking
very
slowly
is
produced
by
the
people
in
number
four
in
return
for
their
work
they
are
given
money
and
the
things
they
have
made
become
the
property
of
the
people
who
do
nothing
then
as
the
money
is
of
no
use
the
workers
go
to
shops
and
give
it
away
in
exchange
for
some
of
the
things
they
themselves
have
made
they
spend
or
give
back
all
their
wages
but
as
the
money
they
got
as
wages
is
not
equal
in
value
to
the
things
they
produced
they
find
that
they
are
only
able
to
buy
back
a
very
small
part
so
you
see
that
these
little
discs
of
metal
this
money
is
a
device
for
enabling
those
who
do
not
work
to
rob
the
workers
of
the
greater
part
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
the
silence
that
ensued
was
broken
by
crass
sounds
very
pretty
he
sneered
i
ca
make
no
or
tail
of
it
meself
here
cried
owen
producing
class
these
people
in
number
four
are
supposed
to
be
paid
for
their
work
their
wages
are
supposed
to
be
equal
in
value
to
their
work
but
it
not
so
if
it
were
by
spending
all
their
wages
the
producing
class
would
be
able
to
buy
back
all
they
had
produced
owen
ceased
speaking
and
silence
once
more
ensued
no
one
gave
any
sign
of
understanding
or
of
agreeing
or
of
disagreeing
with
what
he
had
said
their
attitude
was
strictly
neutral
barrington
pipe
had
gone
out
during
the
argument
he
relit
it
from
the
fire
with
a
piece
of
twisted
paper
their
wages
were
really
equal
in
value
to
the
product
of
their
labour
owen
repeated
would
be
able
to
buy
back
not
a
small
part
but
the
at
this
a
remark
from
bundy
caused
a
shout
of
laughter
and
when
wantley
added
point
to
the
joke
by
making
a
sound
like
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
the
merriment
increased
tenfold
that
done
it
remarked
easton
as
he
got
up
and
opened
the
window
about
time
you
was
buried
if
the
smell
anything
to
go
by
said
harlow
addressing
wantley
who
laughed
and
appeared
to
think
he
had
distinguished
himself
even
if
we
include
the
whole
of
the
working
classes
continued
owen
is
the
people
in
number
three
as
well
as
those
in
number
four
we
find
that
their
combined
wages
are
insufficient
to
buy
the
things
made
by
the
producers
the
total
value
of
the
wealth
produced
in
this
country
during
the
last
year
was
and
the
total
amount
paid
in
wages
during
the
same
period
was
only
in
other
words
by
means
of
the
money
trick
the
workers
were
robbed
of
of
the
value
of
their
labour
all
the
people
in
numbers
three
and
four
are
working
and
suffering
and
starving
and
fighting
in
order
that
the
rich
people
in
numbers
one
and
two
may
live
in
luxury
and
do
nothing
these
are
the
wretches
who
cause
poverty
they
not
only
devour
or
waste
or
hoard
the
things
made
by
the
worker
but
as
soon
as
their
own
wants
are
supplied
they
compel
the
workers
to
cease
working
and
prevent
them
producing
the
things
they
need
most
of
these
people
cried
owen
his
usually
pale
face
flushing
red
and
his
eyes
shining
with
sudden
anger
of
these
people
do
not
deserve
to
be
called
human
beings
at
all
they
devils
they
know
that
whilst
they
are
indulging
in
pleasures
of
every
kind
all
around
them
men
and
women
and
little
children
are
existing
in
want
or
dying
of
hunger
the
silence
which
followed
was
at
length
broken
by
harlow
say
the
workers
is
entitled
to
all
they
produce
but
you
forget
there
the
raw
materials
to
pay
for
they
do
make
them
you
know
course
the
workers
do
create
the
raw
materials
replied
owen
i
am
not
aware
that
the
capitalists
or
the
landlords
do
so
either
the
raw
materials
exist
in
abundance
in
and
on
the
earth
but
they
are
of
no
use
until
labour
has
been
applied
to
them
then
you
see
the
earth
belongs
to
the
landlords
cried
crass
unguardedly
know
that
and
of
course
you
think
it
right
that
the
whole
country
should
belong
to
a
few
people
must
call
the
lecturer
to
horder
interrupted
philpot
land
question
is
not
before
the
meeting
at
present
talk
about
the
producers
being
robbed
of
most
of
the
value
of
what
they
produce
said
harlow
you
must
remember
that
it
ai
all
produced
by
hand
labour
what
about
the
things
what
made
by
machinery
machines
themselves
were
made
by
the
workers
returned
owen
of
course
they
do
not
belong
to
the
workers
who
have
been
robbed
of
them
by
means
of
the
money
trick
who
invented
all
the
machinery
cried
crass
more
than
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
can
say
returned
owen
it
certainly
was
the
wealthy
loafer
class
or
the
landlords
or
the
employers
most
of
the
men
who
invented
the
machinery
lived
and
died
unknown
in
poverty
and
often
in
actual
want
the
inventors
too
were
robbed
by
the
class
there
are
no
men
living
at
present
who
can
justly
claim
to
have
invented
the
machinery
that
exists
today
the
most
they
can
truthfully
say
is
that
they
have
added
to
or
improved
upon
the
ideas
of
those
who
lived
and
worked
before
them
even
watt
and
stevenson
merely
improved
upon
steam
engines
and
locomotives
already
existing
your
question
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
we
are
discussing
we
are
only
trying
to
find
out
why
the
majority
of
people
have
to
go
short
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
one
of
the
causes
is
the
majority
of
the
population
are
engaged
in
work
that
does
not
produce
those
things
and
most
of
what
is
produced
is
appropriated
and
wasted
by
those
who
have
no
right
to
it
workers
produce
everything
if
you
walk
through
the
streets
of
a
town
or
a
city
and
look
around
everything
that
you
can
see
factories
machinery
houses
railways
tramways
canals
furniture
clothing
food
and
the
very
road
or
pavement
you
stand
upon
were
all
made
by
the
working
class
who
spend
all
their
wages
in
buying
back
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
things
they
produce
therefore
what
remains
in
the
possession
of
their
masters
represents
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
work
done
and
the
wages
paid
for
doing
it
this
systematic
robbery
has
been
going
on
for
generations
the
value
of
the
accumulated
loot
is
enormous
and
all
of
it
all
the
wealth
at
present
in
the
possession
of
the
rich
is
rightly
the
property
of
the
working
class
it
has
been
stolen
from
them
by
means
of
the
money
for
some
moments
an
oppressive
silence
prevailed
the
men
stared
with
puzzled
uncomfortable
looks
alternately
at
each
other
and
at
the
drawings
on
the
wall
they
were
compelled
to
do
a
little
thinking
on
their
own
account
and
it
was
a
process
to
which
they
were
unaccustomed
in
their
infancy
they
had
been
taught
to
distrust
their
own
intelligence
and
to
leave
to
their
and
masters
and
to
their
generally
all
their
lives
they
had
been
true
to
this
teaching
they
had
always
had
blind
unreasoning
faith
in
the
wisdom
and
humanity
of
their
pastors
and
masters
that
was
the
reason
why
they
and
their
children
had
been
all
their
lives
on
the
verge
of
starvation
and
nakedness
whilst
their
who
did
nothing
but
the
thinking
went
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
several
men
had
risen
from
their
seats
and
were
attentively
studying
the
diagrams
owen
had
drawn
on
the
wall
and
nearly
all
the
others
were
making
the
same
mental
efforts
they
were
trying
to
think
of
something
to
say
in
defence
of
those
who
robbed
them
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
do
see
no
bloody
sense
in
always
runnin
down
the
rich
said
harlow
at
last
always
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
and
there
always
will
be

everybody
brightened
up
again
and
exchanged
looks
of
satisfaction
and
relief
of
course
it
was
necessary
to
think
about
these
things
at
all
nothing
could
ever
be
altered

had
always
been
more
or
less
the
same
and
it
always
would
be

to
me
that
you
all
hope

owen
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
could
be
done
you
persuade
yourselves
that

then
instead
of
being
sorry
you
glad
some
of
them
laughed
in
a
silly
way
do
you
reckon

harlow
way
to
alter
it
is
first
to

with
a
chuckle

to
be
henlightened

remarked
easton
grimly
chapter
the
slaughter
during
the
afternoon
rushton
and
sweater
visited
the
house
the
latter
having
an
appointment
to
meet
there
a
gardener
to
whom
he
wished
to
give
instructions
concerning
the
laying
out
of
the
grounds
which
had
been
torn
up
for
the
purpose
of
putting
in
the
new
drains
sweater
had
already
arranged
with
the
head
gardener
of
the
public
park
to
steal
some
of
the
best
plants
from
that
place
and
have
them
sent
up
to
cave
these
plants
had
been
arriving
in
small
lots
for
about
a
week
they
must
have
been
brought
there
either
in
the
evening
after
the
men
left
off
or
very
early
in
the
morning
before
they
came
the
two
gentlemen
remained
at
the
house
for
about
half
an
hour
and
as
they
went
away
the
mournful
sound
of
the
town
hall
bell
which
was
always
tolled
to
summon
meetings
of
the
council
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
the
hands
remarked
to
each
other
that
another
robbery
was
about
to
be
perpetrated
hunter
did
not
come
to
the
job
again
that
day
he
had
been
sent
by
rushton
to
price
some
work
for
which
the
firm
was
going
to
tender
an
estimate
there
was
only
one
person
who
felt
any
regret
at
his
absence
and
that
was
mrs
white
bert
mother
who
had
been
working
at
cave
for
several
days
scrubbing
the
floors
as
a
rule
hunter
paid
her
wages
every
night
and
on
this
occasion
she
happened
to
need
the
money
even
more
than
usual
as
leaving
off
time
drew
near
she
mentioned
the
matter
to
crass
who
advised
her
to
call
at
the
office
on
her
way
home
and
ask
the
young
lady
clerk
for
the
money
as
hunter
did
not
appear
she
followed
the
foreman
advice
when
she
reached
the
shop
rushton
was
just
coming
out
she
explained
to
him
what
she
wanted
and
he
instructed
mr
budd
to
tell
miss
wade
to
pay
her
the
shopman
accordingly
escorted
her
to
the
office
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
the
young
lady
after
referring
to
former
entries
to
make
quite
certain
of
the
amount
paid
her
the
sum
that
hunter
had
represented
as
her
wages
the
same
amount
that
miss
wade
had
on
the
previous
occasions
given
him
to
pay
the
charwoman
when
mrs
white
got
outside
she
found
that
she
held
in
her
hand
half
a
crown
instead
of
the
two
shillings
she
usually
received
from
mr
hunter
at
first
she
felt
inclined
to
take
it
back
but
after
some
hesitation
she
thought
it
better
to
wait
until
she
saw
hunter
when
she
could
tell
him
about
it
but
the
next
morning
when
she
saw
the
disciple
at
he
broached
the
subject
first
and
told
her
that
miss
wade
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
evening
when
he
paid
her
he
deducted
the
sixpence
from
the
usual
two
shillings
the
lecture
announced
by
philpot
was
not
delivered
anxiously
awaiting
the
impending
slaughter
the
men
kept
tearing
into
it
as
usual
for
they
generally
keep
working
in
the
usual
way
each
one
trying
to
outdo
the
others
so
as
not
to
lose
his
chance
of
being
one
of
the
lucky
one
misery
now
went
round
and
informed
all
the
men
with
the
exception
of
crass
owen
slyme
and
sawkins
that
they
would
have
to
stand
off
that
night
he
told
them
that
the
firm
had
several
jobs
in
view
work
they
had
tendered
for
and
hoped
to
get
and
said
they
could
look
round
after
christmas
and
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
start
some
of
them
again
they
would
be
paid
at
the
office
tomorrow
saturday
at
one
as
usual
but
if
any
of
them
wished
they
could
have
their
money
tonight
the
men
thanked
him
and
most
of
them
said
they
would
come
for
their
wages
at
the
usual
and
would
call
round
as
he
suggested
after
the
holidays
to
see
if
there
was
anything
to
do
in
all
fifteen
men
including
philpot
harlow
easton
and
ned
dawson
were
to
off
that
night
they
took
their
dismissal
stolidly
without
any
remark
some
of
them
even
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
but
there
were
few
attempts
at
conversation
afterwards
the
little
work
that
remained
to
be
done
they
did
in
silence
every
man
oppressed
by
the
same
terror
the
dread
of
the
impending
want
the
privation
and
unhappiness
that
they
knew
they
and
their
families
would
have
to
suffer
during
the
next
few
months
bundy
and
his
mate
dawson
were
working
in
the
kitchen
fixing
the
new
range
in
place
of
the
old
one
which
they
had
taken
out
they
had
been
engaged
on
this
job
all
day
and
their
hands
and
faces
and
clothes
were
covered
with
soot
which
they
had
also
contrived
to
smear
and
dab
all
over
the
surfaces
of
the
doors
and
other
woodwork
in
the
room
much
to
the
indignation
of
crass
and
slyme
who
had
to
wash
it
all
off
before
they
could
put
on
the
final
coat
of
paint
ca
help
makin
a
little
mess
on
a
job
of
this
kind
you
know
remarked
bundy
as
he
was
giving
the
finishing
touches
to
the
work
making
good
the
broken
parts
of
the
wall
with
cement
whilst
his
mate
was
clearing
away
the
debris
but
there
no
need
to
claw
of
the
bloody
doors
every
time
you
goes
in
and
out
snarled
crass
you
could
put
yer
tools
on
the
floor
instead
of
makin
a
bench
of
the
dresser
can
the
bloody
place
all
to
yerself
in
about
five
minutes
replied
bundy
as
he
assisted
to
lift
a
sack
of
cement
weighing
about
two
hundredweight
on
to
dawson
back
finished
now
when
they
had
cleared
away
all
the
dirt
and
fragments
of
bricks
and
mortar
while
crass
and
slyme
proceeded
with
the
painting
bundy
and
dawson
loaded
up
their
with
the
old
range
and
the
bags
of
unused
cement
and
plaster
which
they
took
back
to
the
yard
meantime
misery
was
wandering
about
the
house
and
gounds
like
an
evil
spirit
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
he
stood
for
some
time
gloomily
watching
the
four
gardeners
who
were
busily
at
work
laying
strips
of
turf
mowing
the
lawn
rolling
the
gravel
paths
and
trimming
the
trees
and
bushes
the
boy
bert
philpot
harlow
easton
and
sawkins
were
loading
a
with
ladders
and
empty
to
return
to
the
yard
just
as
they
were
setting
out
misery
stopped
them
remarking
that
the
cart
was
not
half
loaded
he
said
it
would
take
a
month
to
get
all
the
stuff
away
if
they
went
on
like
that
so
by
his
directions
they
placed
another
long
ladder
on
top
of
the
pile
and
once
more
started
on
their
way
but
before
they
had
gone
two
dozen
yards
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
cart
collapsed
and
the
load
was
scattered
over
the
roadway
bert
was
at
the
same
side
of
the
cart
as
the
wheel
that
broke
and
he
was
thrown
violently
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
half
stunned
in
the
midst
of
the
ladders
and
planks
when
they
got
him
out
they
were
astonished
to
find
that
thanks
to
the
special
providence
that
watches
over
all
small
boys
he
was
almost
unhurt
just
a
little
dazed
that
was
all
and
by
the
time
sawkins
returned
with
another
cart
bert
was
able
to
help
to
gather
up
the
fallen
and
to
accompany
the
men
with
the
load
to
the
yard
at
the
corner
of
the
road
they
paused
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
it
stands
said
harlow
tragically
extending
his
arm
towards
the
house
it
stands
a
job
that
if
they
only
have
let
us
do
it
properly
could
been
done
with
the
number
of
in
less
than
four
months
and
there
it
is
finished
messed
up
slobbered
over
and
scamped
in
nine
weeks
and
now
we
can
all
go
to
said
philpot
gloomily
at
the
yard
they
found
bundy
and
his
mate
ned
dawson
who
helped
them
to
hang
up
the
ladders
in
their
usual
places
philpot
was
glad
to
get
out
of
assisting
to
do
this
for
he
had
contracted
a
rather
severe
attack
of
rheumatism
when
working
outside
at
the
whilst
the
others
were
putting
the
ladders
away
he
assisted
bert
to
carry
the
and
buckets
into
the
paint
shop
and
while
there
he
filled
a
small
medicine
bottle
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
with
turpentine
from
the
tank
he
wanted
this
stuff
to
rub
into
his
shoulders
and
legs
and
as
he
secreted
the
bottle
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
he
muttered
is
where
we
gets
some
of
our
own
back
they
took
the
key
of
the
yard
to
the
office
and
as
they
separated
to
go
home
bundy
suggested
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
would
be
to
sew
their
bloody
mouths
up
for
a
few
months
because
there
was
not
much
probability
of
their
getting
another
job
until
about
march
the
next
morning
while
crass
and
slyme
were
finishing
inside
owen
wrote
the
two
gates
on
the
front
entrance
cave
and
on
the
back
entrance
in
gilded
letters
in
the
meantime
sawkins
and
bert
made
several
journeys
to
the
yard
with
the
crass
working
in
the
kitchen
with
slyme
was
very
silent
and
thoughtful
ever
since
the
job
was
started
every
time
mr
sweater
had
visited
the
house
to
see
what
progress
was
being
made
crass
had
been
grovelling
to
him
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
tip
when
the
work
was
finished
he
had
been
very
careful
to
act
upon
any
suggestions
that
sweater
had
made
from
time
to
time
and
on
several
occasions
had
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
just
the
right
tints
of
certain
colours
making
up
a
number
of
different
shades
and
combinations
and
doing
parts
of
the
skirtings
or
mouldings
of
rooms
in
order
that
mr
sweater
might
see
exactly
before
they
went
on
with
it
what
it
would
look
like
when
finished
he
made
a
great
pretence
of
deferring
to
sweater
opinion
and
assured
him
that
he
did
not
care
how
much
trouble
he
took
as
long
as
he
sweater
was
pleased
in
fact
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
it
was
a
pleasure
as
the
work
neared
completion
crass
began
to
speculate
upon
the
probable
amount
of
the
donation
he
would
receive
as
the
reward
of
nine
weeks
of
cringing
fawning
abject
servility
he
thought
it
quite
possible
that
he
might
get
a
quid
it
would
not
be
too
much
considering
all
the
trouble
he
had
taken
it
was
well
worth
it
at
any
rate
he
felt
certain
that
he
was
sure
to
get
ten
bob
a
gentleman
like
mr
sweater
would
never
have
the
cheek
to
offer
less
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
improbable
it
appeared
that
the
amount
would
be
less
than
a
quid
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
whatever
he
got
he
would
take
good
care
that
none
of
the
other
men
knew
anything
about
it
he
was
the
one
who
had
had
all
the
worry
of
the
job
and
he
was
the
only
one
entitled
to
anything
there
was
to
be
had
besides
even
if
he
got
a
quid
by
the
time
you
divided
that
up
amongst
a
dozen
or
even
amongst
two
or
three
it
would
not
be
worth
having
at
about
eleven
mr
sweater
arrived
and
began
to
walk
over
the
house
followed
by
crass
who
carried
a
pot
of
paint
and
a
small
brush
and
made
believe
to
be
up
and
finishing
off
parts
of
the
work
as
sweater
went
from
one
room
to
another
crass
repeatedly
placed
himself
in
the
way
in
the
hope
of
being
spoken
to
but
sweater
took
no
notice
of
him
whatever
once
or
twice
crass
heart
began
to
beat
quickly
as
he
furtively
watched
the
great
man
and
saw
him
thrust
his
thumb
and
finger
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
on
each
occasion
sweater
withdrew
his
hand
with
nothing
in
it
after
a
while
observing
that
the
gentleman
was
about
to
depart
without
having
spoken
crass
determined
to
break
the
ice
himself
a
little
better
weather
we
now
sir
replied
sweater
was
beginnin
to
be
afraid
as
i
should
be
hable
to
git
heverything
finished
in
time
for
you
to
move
in
before
christmas
sir
crass
continued
it
hall
done
now
sir
sweater
made
no
reply
kept
the
fire
agoin
in
hall
the
rooms
has
you
told
me
sir
resumed
crass
after
a
pause
think
you
find
as
the
place
is
nice
and
dry
sir
the
honly
places
as
is
a
bit
damp
is
the
kitchen
and
scullery
and
the
other
rooms
in
the
basement
sir
but
of
course
nearly
halways
the
case
sir
when
the
rooms
is
partly
hunderground
sir
of
course
it
do
matter
so
much
about
the
basement
sir
because
it
honly
the
servants
what
to
use
it
sir
and
even
down
there
it
be
hall
right
hin
the
summer
sir
one
would
scarcely
think
from
the
contemptuous
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
that
crass
own
daughter
was
service
but
such
was
the
case
yes
there
no
doubt
about
that
replied
sweater
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
no
doubt
it
will
be
dry
enough
in
the
summer
good
morning
morning
to
you
sir
said
crass
following
him
as
you
pleased
with
all
the
work
sir
everything
satisfactory
sir
yes
i
think
it
looks
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
i
very
pleased
with
it
said
sweater
affably
morning
morning
sir
replied
the
foreman
with
a
sickly
smile
as
sweater
departed
when
the
other
was
gone
crass
sat
down
dejectedly
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
stairs
overwhelmed
with
the
ruin
of
his
hopes
and
expectations
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
all
hope
was
not
lost
because
he
would
have
to
come
to
the
house
again
on
monday
and
tuesday
to
fix
the
venetian
blinds
but
all
the
same
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
it
was
only
a
very
faint
hope
for
he
felt
that
if
sweater
had
intended
giving
anything
he
would
have
done
so
today
and
it
was
very
improbable
that
he
would
see
sweater
on
monday
or
tuesday
at
all
for
the
latter
did
not
usually
visit
the
job
in
the
early
part
of
the
week
however
crass
made
up
his
mind
to
hope
for
the
best
and
pulling
himself
together
he
presently
returned
to
the
kitchen
where
he
found
slyme
and
sawkins
waiting
for
him
he
had
not
mentioned
his
hopes
of
a
tip
to
either
of
them
but
they
did
not
need
any
telling
and
they
were
both
determined
to
have
their
share
of
whatever
he
got
they
eyed
him
keenly
as
he
entered
did
give
yer
demanded
sawkins
going
straight
to
the
point
me
replied
crass
slyme
laughed
in
a
sneering
incredulous
way
but
sawkins
was
inclined
to
be
abusive
he
averred
that
he
had
been
watching
crass
and
sweater
and
had
seen
the
latter
put
his
thumb
and
finger
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
as
he
walked
into
the
followed
by
crass
it
took
the
latter
a
long
time
to
convince
his
two
workmates
of
the
truth
of
his
own
account
but
he
succeeded
at
last
and
they
all
three
agreed
that
old
sweater
was
a
sanguinary
rotter
and
they
lamented
over
the
decay
of
the
good
customs
at
one
time
o
day
said
crass
a
few
years
ago
if
you
went
to
a
gentleman
to
paint
one
or
two
rooms
you
could
always
be
sure
of
a
bob
or
two
when
you
finished
by
half
past
twelve
everything
was
squared
up
and
having
loaded
up
the
with
all
that
remained
of
the
materials
dirty
and
plant
they
all
set
out
together
for
the
yard
to
put
all
the
things
away
before
going
to
the
office
for
their
money
sawkins
took
the
handle
of
the
cart
slyme
and
crass
walked
at
one
side
and
owen
and
bert
at
the
other
there
was
no
need
to
push
for
the
road
was
downhill
most
of
the
way
so
much
so
that
they
had
all
to
help
to
hold
back
the
cart
which
travelled
so
rapidly
that
bert
found
it
difficult
to
keep
pace
with
the
others
and
frequently
broke
into
a
trot
to
recover
lost
ground
and
crass
being
fleshy
and
bloated
with
beer
besides
being
unused
to
much
exertion
began
to
perspire
and
soon
appealed
to
the
others
not
to
let
it
go
so
fast
there
was
no
need
to
get
done
before
one
chapter
the
march
of
the
imperialists
it
was
an
unusually
fine
day
for
the
time
of
year
and
as
they
passed
along
the
grand
parade
which
faced
due
south
they
felt
quite
warm
the
parade
was
crowded
with
richly
dressed
and
bejewelled
loafers
whose
countenances
in
many
instances
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
drunkenness
and
gluttony
some
of
the
females
had
tried
to
conceal
the
ravages
of
vice
and
dissipation
by
coating
their
faces
with
powder
and
paint
mingling
with
and
part
of
this
crowd
were
a
number
of
individuals
dressed
in
long
garments
of
black
cloth
of
the
finest
texture
and
soft
felt
hats
most
of
these
persons
had
gold
rings
on
their
soft
white
fingers
and
kid
or
calfskin
boots
on
their
feet
they
belonged
to
the
great
army
of
imposters
who
obtain
an
easy
living
by
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
and
simplicity
of
their
and
pretending
to
be
the
and
of
the
lowly
carpenter
of
nazareth
the
man
of
sorrows
who
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
none
of
these
were
associating
with
the
groups
of
unemployed
carpenters
bricklayers
plasterers
and
painters
who
stood
here
and
there
in
the
dressed
in
mean
and
shabby
clothing
and
with
faces
pale
with
privation
many
of
these
latter
were
known
to
our
friends
with
the
cart
and
nodded
to
them
as
they
passed
now
and
then
some
of
them
came
over
and
walked
a
little
distance
by
their
side
inquiring
whether
there
was
any
news
of
another
job
at
rushton
when
they
were
about
down
the
parade
just
near
the
fountain
crass
and
his
mates
encountered
a
number
of
men
on
whose
arms
were
white
bands
with
the
word
in
black
letters
they
carried
collecting
boxes
and
accosted
the
people
in
the
street
begging
for
money
for
the
unemployed
these
men
were
a
kind
of
skirmishers
for
the
main
body
which
could
be
seen
some
distance
behind
as
the
procession
drew
near
sawkins
steered
the
cart
into
the
kerb
and
halted
as
they
went
past
there
were
about
three
hundred
men
altogether
marching
four
abreast
they
carried
three
large
white
banners
with
black
letters
to
our
subscribers
aid
of
genuine
unemployed
children
must
be
fed
although
there
were
a
number
of
artisans
in
the
procession
the
majority
of
the
men
belonged
to
what
is
called
the
unskilled
labourer
class
the
skilled
artisan
does
not
as
a
rule
take
part
in
such
a
procession
except
as
a
very
last
resource
and
all
the
time
he
strives
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
being
and
would
be
highly
indignant
if
anyone
suggested
that
he
was
really
in
a
condition
of
abject
miserable
poverty
although
he
knows
that
his
children
are
often
not
so
well
fed
as
are
the
pet
dogs
and
cats
of
his
he
tries
to
bluff
his
neighbours
into
thinking
that
he
has
some
mysterious
private
means
of
which
they
know
nothing
and
conceals
his
poverty
as
if
it
were
a
crime
most
of
this
class
of
men
would
rather
starve
than
beg
consequently
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
men
in
the
procession
were
skilled
artisans
the
majority
were
labourers
there
was
also
a
sprinkling
of
those
unfortunate
outcasts
of
society
tramps
and
destitute
drunken
loafers
if
the
hypocrites
who
despise
these
poor
wretches
had
been
subjected
to
the
same
conditions
the
majority
of
them
would
inevitably
have
become
the
same
as
these
haggard
and
pale
shabbily
or
raggedly
dressed
their
boots
broken
and
down
at
heel
they
slouched
past
some
of
them
stared
about
with
a
dazed
or
expression
but
most
of
them
walked
with
downcast
eyes
or
staring
blankly
straight
in
front
of
them
they
appeared
utterly
hopeless
and
ashamed
can
see
what
they
are
sneered
crass
is
fifty
genuine
tradesmen
in
the
whole
crowd
and
most
of
would
work
if
they
the
offer
of
it
just
what
i
was
thinkin
agreed
sawkins
with
a
laugh
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
say
that
when
they
have
been
offered
work
and
have
refused
to
do
it
said
owen
sort
of
thing
does
the
town
a
lot
of
remarked
slyme
ought
to
be
allowed
the
police
ought
to
stop
it
it
enough
to
drive
all
the
gentry
out
of
the
place
disgraceful
i
call
it
said
crass
along
the
grand
parade
on
a
beautiful
day
like
this
just
at
the
very
time
when
most
of
the
gentry
is
out
enjoyin
the
fresh
hair
suppose
you
think
they
ought
to
stay
at
home
and
starve
quietly
said
owen
do
see
why
these
men
should
care
what
harm
they
do
to
the
town
the
town
does
seem
to
care
much
what
becomes
of
them
you
believe
in
this
sort
of
thing
then
asked
slyme
certainly
not
i
do
believe
in
begging
as
a
favour
for
what
one
is
entitled
to
demand
as
a
right
from
the
thieves
who
have
robbed
them
and
who
are
now
enjoying
the
fruits
of
their
labour
from
the
look
of
shame
on
their
faces
you
might
think
that
they
were
the
criminals
instead
of
being
the
victims
you
must
admit
that
most
of
them
is
very
inferior
men
said
crass
with
a
air
very
few
mechanics
amongst
em
about
it
if
they
are
what
difference
does
that
make
replied
owen
human
beings
and
they
have
as
much
right
to
live
as
anyone
else
what
is
called
unskilled
labour
is
just
as
necessary
and
useful
as
yours
or
mine
i
am
no
more
capable
of
doing
the
unskilled
labour
that
most
of
these
men
do
than
most
of
them
would
be
capable
of
doing
my
work
if
they
was
skilled
tradesmen
they
might
find
it
easier
to
get
a
job
said
crass
owen
laughed
offensively
you
mean
to
say
you
think
that
if
all
these
men
could
be
transformed
into
skilled
carpenters
plasterers
bricklayers
and
painters
that
it
would
be
easier
for
all
those
other
chaps
whom
we
passed
a
little
while
ago
to
get
work
is
it
possible
that
you
or
any
other
sane
man
can
believe
anything
so
silly
as
that
crass
did
not
reply
there
is
not
enough
work
to
employ
all
the
mechanics
whom
we
see
standing
idle
about
the
streets
how
would
it
help
these
labourers
in
the
procession
if
they
could
all
become
skilled
workmen
still
crass
did
not
answer
and
neither
slyme
nor
sawkins
came
to
his
assistance
that
could
be
done
continued
owen
would
simply
make
things
worse
for
those
who
are
already
skilled
mechanics
a
greater
number
of
skilled
workers
keener
competition
for
skilled
workmen
jobs
a
larger
number
of
mechanics
out
of
employment
and
consequently
improved
opportunities
for
employers
to
reduce
wages
that
is
probably
the
reason
why
the
liberal
party
which
consists
for
the
most
part
of
exploiters
of
labour
procured
the
great
jim
scalds
to
tell
us
that
improved
technical
education
is
the
remedy
for
unemployment
and
poverty
suppose
you
think
jim
scalds
is
a
bloody
fool
the
same
as
everybody
else
what
do
see
things
your
way
said
sawkins
should
think
he
was
a
fool
if
i
thought
he
believed
what
he
says
but
i
do
think
he
believes
it
he
says
it
because
he
thinks
the
majority
of
the
working
classes
are
such
fools
that
they
will
believe
him
if
he
did
think
that
most
of
us
are
fools
he
would
tell
us
such
a
yarn
as
that
i
suppose
you
think
as
opinion
ai
far
wrong
snarled
crass
shall
be
better
able
to
judge
of
that
after
the
next
general
election
replied
owen
the
working
classes
again
elect
a
majority
of
liberal
or
tory
landlords
and
employers
to
rule
over
them
it
will
prove
that
jim
scalds
estimate
of
their
intelligence
is
about
right
anyhow
persisted
slyme
do
think
it
a
right
thing
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
go
marchin
about
like
that
driving
visitors
out
of
the
town
do
you
think
they
ought
to
do
then
demanded
owen
the
b
rs
go
to
the
bloody
workhouse
shouted
crass
before
they
could
be
received
there
they
would
have
to
be
absolutely
homeless
and
destitute
and
then
the
ratepayers
would
have
to
keep
them
it
costs
about
twelve
shillings
a
week
for
each
inmate
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
more
sensible
and
economical
for
the
community
to
employ
them
on
some
productive
work
they
had
by
this
time
arrived
at
the
yard
the
steps
and
ladders
were
put
away
in
their
places
and
the
dirty
and
pails
were
placed
in
the
on
the
bench
and
on
the
floor
with
what
had
previously
been
brought
back
there
were
a
great
many
of
these
things
all
needing
to
be
cleaned
out
so
bert
at
any
rate
stood
in
no
danger
of
being
out
of
employment
for
some
time
to
come
when
they
were
paid
at
the
office
owen
on
opening
his
envelope
found
it
contained
as
usual
a
time
sheet
for
the
next
week
which
meant
that
he
was
not
off
although
he
did
not
know
what
work
there
would
be
to
do
crass
and
slyme
were
both
to
go
to
the
to
fix
the
venetian
blinds
and
sawkins
also
was
to
come
to
work
as
usual
chapter
the
week
before
christmas
during
the
next
week
owen
painted
a
sign
on
the
outer
wall
of
one
of
the
workshops
at
the
yard
and
he
also
wrote
the
name
of
the
firm
on
three
of
the
handcarts
these
and
other
odd
jobs
kept
him
employed
a
few
hours
every
day
so
that
he
was
not
actually
out
of
work
one
afternoon
there
being
nothing
to
do
he
went
home
at
three
but
almost
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
house
bert
white
came
with
a
which
had
to
be
written
at
once
the
lad
said
he
had
been
instructed
to
wait
for
it
nora
gave
the
boy
some
tea
and
bread
and
butter
to
eat
whilst
owen
was
doing
the
and
presently
frankie
who
had
been
playing
out
in
the
street
made
his
appearance
the
two
boys
were
already
known
to
each
other
for
bert
had
been
there
several
times
before
on
errands
similar
to
the
present
one
or
to
take
lessons
on
graining
and
from
owen
going
to
have
a
party
next
monday
after
christmas
remarked
frankie
told
me
i
might
ask
you
if
you
come
right
said
bert
i
bring
my
pandoramer
is
it
is
it
alive
asked
frankie
with
a
puzzled
look
no
of
course
not
replied
bert
with
a
superior
air
a
show
like
they
have
at
the
hippodrome
or
the
circus
big
is
it
very
big
it
made
out
of
a
i
made
it
myself
not
quite
finished
yet
but
i
shall
get
it
done
this
week
there
a
band
as
well
you
know
i
do
that
part
with
this
was
a
large
mouth
organ
which
he
produced
from
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
something
now
bert
accordingly
played
and
frankie
sang
at
the
top
of
his
voice
a
selection
of
popular
songs
including
old
bull
and
bush
anyone
seen
a
german
band
at
the
church
and
finally
possibly
as
a
dirge
for
the
individual
whose
owen
was
writing
mignonette
and
would
leave
my
little
wooden
hut
for
you
do
know
what
in
that
said
frankie
referring
to
a
large
earthenware
which
nora
had
just
asked
owen
to
help
her
to
lift
from
the
floor
on
to
one
of
the
chairs
the
vessel
in
question
was
covered
with
a
clean
white
cloth
pudding
replied
bert
promptly
right
first
time
cried
frankie
got
the
things
out
of
the
christmas
club
on
saturday
we
been
paying
in
ever
since
last
christmas
we
going
to
mix
it
now
and
you
can
have
a
stir
too
if
you
like
for
luck
whilst
they
were
stirring
the
pudding
frankie
several
times
requested
the
others
to
feel
his
muscle
he
said
he
felt
sure
that
he
would
soon
be
strong
enough
to
go
out
to
work
and
he
explained
to
bert
that
the
extraordinary
strength
he
possessed
was
to
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
he
lived
almost
exclusively
on
porridge
and
milk
for
the
rest
of
the
week
owen
continued
to
work
down
at
the
yard
with
sawkins
crass
and
slyme
painting
some
of
the
ladders
steps
and
other
plant
belonging
to
the
firm
these
things
had
to
have
two
coats
of
paint
and
the
name
rushton
written
on
them
as
soon
as
they
had
got
some
of
them
owen
went
on
with
the
writing
leaving
the
painting
for
the
others
so
as
to
share
the
work
as
fairly
as
possible
several
times
during
the
week
one
or
other
of
them
was
taken
away
to
do
some
other
work
once
crass
and
slyme
had
to
go
and
wash
off
and
whiten
a
ceiling
somewhere
and
several
times
sawkins
was
sent
out
to
assist
the
plumbers
every
day
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
off
called
at
the
yard
to
ask
if
any
other
had
in
from
these
callers
they
heard
all
the
news
old
jack
linden
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
anything
to
do
at
the
trade
since
he
was
discharged
from
rushton
and
it
was
reported
that
he
was
trying
to
earn
a
little
money
by
hawking
bloaters
from
house
to
house
as
for
philpot
he
said
that
he
had
been
round
to
nearly
all
the
firms
in
the
town
and
none
of
them
had
any
work
to
speak
of
newman
the
man
whom
the
reader
will
remember
was
sacked
for
taking
too
much
pains
with
his
work
had
been
arrested
and
sentenced
to
a
imprisonment
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
pay
his
poor
rates
and
the
board
of
guardians
were
allowing
his
wife
three
shillings
a
week
to
maintain
herself
and
the
three
children
philpot
had
been
to
see
them
and
she
told
him
that
the
landlord
was
threatening
to
turn
them
into
the
street
he
would
have
seized
their
furniture
and
sold
it
if
it
had
been
worth
the
expense
of
the
doing
feel
ashamed
of
meself
philpot

in
confidence
to
owen
i
think
of
all
the
money

it
was
for
that

a
hole

only
place
where

a
little
enjoyment
but

three
shillings
all
they
have
to
live
on

she

replied
philpot
i
do
see
as
she
can
do
a
great
deal
o
that
with
three
young
to
look
after
and
from
what
i
hear
of
it
she
only
just
got
over
a
illness
and
ai
fit
to
do
much
god
said
owen
tell
you
what
said
philpot
been
thinking
we
might
get
up
a
bit
of
a
subscription
for
there
several
chaps
in
work
what
knows
newman
and
if
they
was
each
to
give
a
trifle
we
could
get
enough
to
pay
for
a
christmas
dinner
anyway
i
brought
a
sheet
of
foolscap
with
me
and
i
was
goin
to
ask
you
to
write
out
the
heading
for
me
as
there
was
no
pen
available
at
the
workshop
philpot
waited
till
four
and
then
accompanied
owen
home
where
the
heading
of
the
list
was
written
owen
put
his
name
down
for
a
shilling
and
philpot
his
for
a
similar
amount
philpot
stayed
to
tea
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
spend
christmas
day
with
them
and
to
come
to
frankie
party
on
the
monday
after
the
next
morning
philpot
brought
the
list
to
the
yard
and
crass
and
slyme
put
their
names
down
for
a
shilling
each
and
sawkins
for
threepence
it
being
arranged
that
the
money
was
to
be
paid
on
payday
christmas
eve
in
the
meantime
philpot
was
to
see
as
many
as
he
could
of
those
who
were
in
work
at
other
firms
and
get
as
many
subscriptions
as
possible
at
on
christmas
eve
philpot
turned
up
with
the
list
and
owen
and
the
others
paid
him
the
amounts
they
had
put
their
names
down
for
from
other
men
he
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
nine
and
sixpence
mostly
in
sixpences
and
threepences
some
of
this
money
he
had
already
received
but
for
the
most
part
he
had
made
appointments
with
the
subscribers
to
call
at
their
homes
that
evening
it
was
decided
that
owen
should
accompany
him
and
also
go
with
him
to
hand
over
the
money
to
mrs
newman
it
took
them
nearly
three
hours
to
get
in
all
the
money
for
the
places
they
had
to
go
to
were
in
different
localities
and
in
one
or
two
cases
they
had
to
wait
because
their
man
had
not
yet
come
home
and
sometimes
it
was
not
possible
to
get
away
without
wasting
a
little
time
in
talk
in
three
instances
those
who
had
put
their
names
down
for
threepence
increased
the
amount
to
sixpence
and
one
who
had
promised
sixpence
gave
a
shilling
there
were
two
items
of
threepence
each
which
they
did
not
get
at
all
the
individuals
who
had
put
their
names
down
having
gone
upon
the
drunk
another
cause
of
delay
was
that
they
met
or
called
on
several
other
men
who
had
not
yet
been
asked
for
a
subscription
and
there
were
several
others
including
some
members
of
the
painters
society
whom
owen
had
spoken
to
during
the
week
who
had
promised
him
to
give
a
subscription
in
the
end
they
succeeded
in
increasing
the
total
amount
to
nineteen
and
ninepence
and
they
then
put
each
to
make
it
up
to
a
pound
the
newmans
lived
in
a
small
house
the
rent
of
which
was
six
shillings
per
week
and
taxes
to
reach
the
house
one
had
to
go
down
a
dark
and
narrow
passage
between
two
shops
the
house
being
in
a
kind
of
well
surrounded
by
the
high
walls
of
the
back
parts
of
larger
buildings
chiefly
business
premises
and
offices
the
air
did
not
circulate
very
freely
in
this
place
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
never
reached
it
in
the
summer
the
atmosphere
was
close
and
foul
with
the
various
odours
which
came
from
the
of
the
adjoining
buildings
and
in
the
winter
it
was
dark
and
damp
and
gloomy
a
for
bacteria
and
microbes
the
majority
of
those
who
profess
to
be
desirous
of
preventing
and
curing
the
disease
called
consumption
must
be
either
hypocrites
or
fools
for
they
ridicule
the
suggestion
that
it
is
necessary
first
to
cure
and
prevent
the
poverty
that
compels
badly
clothed
and
human
beings
to
sleep
in
such
dens
as
this
the
front
door
opened
into
the
or
rather
kitchen
which
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
small
paraffin
lamp
on
the
table
where
were
also
some
and
saucers
each
of
a
different
pattern
and
the
remains
of
a
loaf
of
bread
the
wallpaper
was
old
and
discoloured
a
few
almanacs
and
unframed
prints
were
fixed
to
the
walls
and
on
the
mantelshelf
were
some
cracked
and
worthless
vases
and
ornaments
at
one
time
they
had
possessed
a
clock
and
an
overmantel
and
some
framed
pictures
but
they
had
all
been
sold
to
obtain
money
to
buy
food
nearly
everything
of
any
value
had
been
parted
with
for
the
same
reason
the
furniture
the
pictures
the
bedclothes
the
carpet
and
the
oilcloth
piece
by
piece
nearly
everything
that
had
once
constituted
the
home
had
been
either
pawned
or
sold
to
buy
food
or
to
pay
rent
during
the
times
when
newman
was
out
of
work
periods
that
had
recurred
during
the
last
few
years
with
constantly
increasing
frequency
and
duration
now
there
was
nothing
left
but
these
few
old
broken
chairs
and
the
deal
table
which
no
one
would
buy
and
upstairs
the
wretched
bedsteads
and
mattresses
whereon
they
slept
at
night
covering
themselves
with
remnants
of
blankets
and
the
clothes
they
wore
during
the
day
in
answer
to
philpot
knock
the
door
was
opened
by
a
little
girl
about
seven
years
old
who
at
once
recognized
philpot
and
called
out
his
name
to
her
mother
and
the
latter
came
also
to
the
door
closely
followed
by
two
other
children
a
little
girl
about
three
and
a
boy
about
five
years
of
age
who
held
on
to
her
skirt
and
peered
curiously
at
the
visitors
mrs
newman
was
about
thirty
and
her
appearance
confirmed
the
statement
of
philpot
that
she
had
only
just
recovered
from
an
illness
she
was
very
white
and
thin
and
when
philpot
explained
the
object
of
their
visit
and
handed
her
the
money
the
poor
woman
burst
into
tears
and
the
two
smaller
children
thinking
that
this
piece
of
paper
betokened
some
fresh
calamity
began
to
cry
also
they
remembered
that
all
their
troubles
had
been
preceded
by
the
visits
of
men
who
brought
pieces
of
paper
and
it
was
rather
difficult
to
reassure
them
that
evening
after
frankie
was
asleep
owen
and
nora
went
out
to
do
their
christmas
marketing
they
had
not
much
money
to
spend
for
owen
had
brought
home
only
seventeen
shillings
he
had
worked
hours
that
came
to
nineteen
and
threepence
one
shilling
and
threehalfpence
had
gone
on
the
subscription
list
and
he
had
given
the
rest
of
the
coppers
to
a
ragged
wreck
of
a
man
who
was
singing
a
hymn
in
the
street
the
other
shilling
had
been
deducted
from
his
wages
in
repayment
of
a
he
had
had
during
the
week
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
done
with
this
seventeen
shillings
first
of
all
there
was
the
rent
seven
shillings
that
left
ten
then
there
was
the
week
bread
bill
one
and
threepence
they
had
a
pint
of
milk
every
day
chiefly
for
the
boy
sake
that
came
to
one
and
two
then
there
was
one
and
eight
for
a
hundredweight
of
coal
that
had
been
bought
on
credit
fortunately
there
were
no
groceries
to
buy
for
the
things
they
had
obtained
with
their
christmas
club
money
would
be
more
than
sufficient
for
the
ensuing
week
frankie
stockings
were
all
broken
and
beyond
mending
so
it
was
positively
necessary
to
buy
him
another
pair
for
fivepence
these
stockings
were
not
much
good
a
pair
at
double
the
price
would
have
been
much
cheaper
for
they
would
have
lasted
three
or
four
times
longer
but
they
could
not
afford
to
buy
the
dearer
kind
it
was
just
the
same
with
the
coal
if
they
had
been
able
to
afford
it
they
could
have
bought
a
ton
of
the
same
class
of
coal
for
shillings
but
buying
it
as
they
did
by
the
hundredweight
they
had
to
pay
at
the
rate
of
shillings
and
fourpence
a
ton
it
was
just
the
same
with
nearly
everything
else
this
is
how
the
working
classes
are
robbed
although
their
incomes
are
the
lowest
they
are
compelled
to
buy
the
most
expensive
articles
that
is
the
articles
everybody
knows
that
good
clothes
boots
or
furniture
are
really
the
cheapest
in
the
end
although
they
cost
more
money
at
first
but
the
working
classes
can
seldom
or
never
afford
to
buy
good
things
they
have
to
buy
cheap
rubbish
which
is
dear
at
any
price
six
weeks
previously
owen
bought
a
pair
of
boots
for
three
shillings
and
they
were
now
literally
falling
to
pieces
nora
shoes
were
in
much
the
same
condition
but
as
she
said
it
did
not
matter
so
much
about
hers
because
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
go
out
if
the
weather
were
not
fine
in
addition
to
the
articles
already
mentioned
they
had
to
spend
fourpence
for
half
a
gallon
of
paraffin
oil
and
to
put
sixpence
into
the
slot
of
the
this
reduced
the
money
to
five
and
sevenpence
farthing
and
of
this
it
was
necessary
to
spend
a
shilling
on
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
they
both
needed
some
new
underclothing
for
what
they
had
was
so
old
and
worn
that
it
was
quite
useless
for
the
purpose
it
was
supposed
to
serve
but
there
was
no
use
thinking
of
these
things
for
they
had
now
only
four
shillings
and
sevenpence
farthing
left
and
all
that
would
be
needed
for
toys
they
had
to
buy
something
special
for
frankie
for
christmas
and
it
would
also
be
necessary
to
buy
something
for
each
of
the
children
who
were
coming
to
the
party
on
the
following
monday
fortunately
there
was
no
meat
to
buy
for
nora
had
been
paying
into
the
christmas
club
at
the
butcher
as
well
as
at
the
grocer
so
this
necessary
was
already
paid
for
they
stopped
to
look
at
the
display
of
toys
at
sweater
emporium
for
several
days
past
frankie
had
been
talking
of
the
wonders
contained
in
these
windows
so
they
wished
if
possible
to
buy
him
something
here
they
recognized
many
of
the
things
from
the
description
the
boy
had
given
of
them
but
nearly
everything
was
so
dear
that
for
a
long
time
they
looked
in
vain
for
something
it
would
be
possible
to
buy
the
engine
he
talks
so
much
about
said
non
indicating
a
model
railway
locomotive
that
one
marked
five
shillings
might
just
as
well
be
marked
five
pounds
as
far
as
concerned
replied
owen
as
they
were
speaking
one
of
the
salesmen
appeared
at
the
back
of
the
window
and
reaching
forward
removed
the
engine
it
was
probably
the
last
one
of
the
kind
and
had
evidently
just
been
sold
owen
and
nora
experienced
a
certain
amount
of
consolation
in
knowing
that
even
if
they
had
the
money
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
buy
it
after
lengthy
consideration
they
decided
on
a
clockwork
engine
at
a
shilling
but
the
other
toys
they
resolved
to
buy
at
a
cheaper
shop
nora
went
into
the
emporium
to
get
the
toy
and
whilst
owen
was
waiting
for
her
mr
and
mrs
rushton
came
out
they
did
not
appear
to
see
owen
who
observed
that
the
shape
of
one
of
several
parcels
they
carried
suggested
that
it
contained
the
engine
that
had
been
taken
from
the
window
a
little
while
before
when
nora
returned
with
her
purchase
they
went
in
search
of
a
cheaper
place
and
after
a
time
they
found
what
they
wanted
for
sixpence
they
bought
a
cardboard
box
that
had
come
all
the
way
from
japan
and
contained
a
whole
family
of
dolls
father
mother
and
four
children
of
different
sizes
a
box
of
paints
threepence
a
sixpenny
tea
service
a
threepenny
drawing
slate
and
a
rag
doll
sixpence
on
their
way
home
they
called
at
a
greengrocer
where
owen
had
ordered
and
paid
for
a
small
christmas
tree
a
few
weeks
before
and
as
they
were
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
where
they
lived
they
met
crass
with
a
fine
fat
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder
by
its
neck
he
greeted
owen
jovially
and
held
up
the
bird
for
their
inspection
a
bad
eh
he
hiccoughed
makes
two
got
i
won
this
and
a
box
of
cigars
fifty
for
a
tanner
and
the
other
one
i
got
out
of
the
club
at
our
church
mission
threepence
a
week
for
weeks
that
makes
seven
bob
but
he
added
confidentially
could
buy
for
that
price
in
a
shop
you
know
they
costs
the
committee
a
good
bit
more
nor
that
wholesale
but
we
got
some
rich
gents
on
our
committee
and
they
makes
up
the
difference
and
with
a
nod
and
a
cunning
leer
he
lurched
off
frankie
was
sleeping
soundly
when
they
reached
home
and
so
was
the
kitten
which
was
curled
up
on
the
quilt
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
after
they
had
had
some
supper
although
it
was
after
eleven
owen
fixed
the
tree
in
a
large
that
had
served
a
similar
purpose
before
and
nora
brought
out
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
stored
away
since
last
christmas
a
cardboard
box
containing
a
lot
of
glittering
tinsel
ornaments
globes
of
silvered
or
gilded
or
painted
glass
birds
butterflies
and
stars
some
of
these
things
had
done
duty
three
christmases
ago
and
although
they
were
in
some
instances
slightly
tarnished
most
of
them
were
as
good
as
new
in
addition
to
these
and
the
toys
they
had
bought
that
evening
they
had
a
box
of
and
a
box
of
small
coloured
wax
candles
both
of
which
had
formed
part
of
the
things
they
got
from
the
grocer
with
the
christmas
club
money
and
there
were
also
a
lot
of
little
coloured
paper
bags
of
sweets
and
a
number
of
sugar
and
chocolate
toys
and
animals
which
had
been
bought
two
or
three
at
a
time
for
several
weeks
past
and
put
away
for
this
occasion
there
was
something
suitable
for
each
child
that
was
coming
with
the
exception
of
bert
white
they
had
intended
to
include
a
sixpenny
pocket
knife
for
him
in
their
purchases
that
evening
but
as
they
had
not
been
able
to
afford
this
owen
decided
to
give
him
an
old
set
of
steel
graining
combs
which
he
knew
the
lad
had
often
longed
to
possess
the
tin
case
containing
these
tools
was
accordingly
wrapped
in
some
red
tissue
paper
and
hung
on
the
tree
with
the
other
things
they
moved
about
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
disturb
those
who
were
sleeping
in
the
rooms
beneath
because
long
before
they
were
finished
the
people
in
the
other
parts
of
the
house
had
all
retired
to
rest
and
silence
had
fallen
on
the
deserted
streets
outside
as
they
were
putting
the
final
touches
to
their
work
the
profound
stillness
of
the
night
was
suddenly
broken
by
the
voices
of
a
band
of
the
sound
overwhelmed
them
with
memories
of
other
and
happier
times
and
nora
stretched
out
her
hands
impulsively
to
owen
who
drew
her
close
to
his
side
they
had
been
married
just
over
eight
years
and
although
during
all
that
time
they
had
never
been
really
free
from
anxiety
for
the
future
yet
on
no
previous
christmas
had
they
been
quite
so
poor
as
now
during
the
last
few
years
periods
of
unemployment
had
gradually
become
more
frequent
and
protracted
and
the
attempt
he
had
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
to
get
work
elsewhere
had
only
resulted
in
plunging
them
into
even
greater
poverty
than
before
but
all
the
same
there
was
much
to
be
thankful
for
poor
though
they
were
they
were
far
better
off
than
many
thousands
of
others
they
still
had
food
and
shelter
and
they
had
each
other
and
the
boy
before
they
went
to
bed
owen
carried
the
tree
into
frankie
bedroom
and
placed
it
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
see
it
in
all
its
glittering
glory
as
soon
as
he
awoke
on
christmas
morning
chapter
the
pandorama
although
the
party
was
not
supposed
to
begin
till
six
bert
turned
up
at
half
past
four
bringing
the
with
him
at
about
half
past
five
the
other
guests
began
to
arrive
elsie
and
charley
linden
came
first
the
girl
in
a
pretty
blue
frock
trimmed
with
white
lace
and
charley
resplendent
in
a
new
suit
which
like
his
sister
dress
had
been
made
out
of
somebody
clothes
that
had
been
given
to
their
mother
by
a
visiting
lady
it
had
taken
mrs
linden
many
hours
of
hard
work
to
contrive
these
garments
in
fact
more
time
than
the
things
were
worth
for
although
they
looked
all
right
especially
elsie
the
stuff
was
so
old
that
it
would
not
wear
very
long
but
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
she
could
get
clothes
for
the
children
at
all
she
certainly
could
not
afford
to
buy
them
any
so
she
spent
hours
and
hours
making
things
that
she
knew
would
fall
to
pieces
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
made
after
these
came
nellie
rosie
and
tommy
newman
these
presented
a
much
less
prosperous
appearance
than
the
other
two
their
mother
was
not
so
skilful
at
contriving
new
clothes
out
of
old
nellie
was
wearing
a
woman
blouse
and
by
way
of
ulster
she
had
on
an
jacket
of
thick
cloth
with
large
pearl
buttons
this
was
also
a
woman
garment
it
was
shaped
to
fit
the
figure
of
a
tall
woman
with
wide
shoulders
and
a
small
waist
consequently
it
did
not
fit
nellie
to
perfection
the
waist
reached
below
the
poor
hips
tommy
was
arrayed
in
the
patched
remains
of
what
had
once
been
a
good
suit
of
clothes
they
had
been
purchased
at
a
shop
last
summer
and
had
been
his
for
several
months
but
they
were
now
much
too
small
for
him
little
rosie
who
was
only
just
over
three
years
old
was
better
off
than
either
of
the
other
two
for
she
had
a
red
cloth
dress
that
fitted
her
perfectly
indeed
as
the
district
visitor
who
gave
it
to
her
mother
had
remarked
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
her
not
much
to
look
at
observed
nellie
referring
to
her
big
jacket
but
all
the
same
we
was
very
glad
of
it
when
the
rain
came
on
the
coat
was
so
big
that
by
withdrawing
her
arms
from
the
sleeves
and
using
it
as
a
cloak
or
shawl
she
had
managed
to
make
it
do
for
all
three
of
them
tommy
boots
were
so
broken
that
the
wet
had
got
in
and
saturated
his
stockings
so
nora
made
him
take
them
all
off
and
wear
some
old
ones
of
frankie
whilst
his
own
were
drying
at
the
fire
philpot
with
two
large
paper
bags
full
of
oranges
and
nuts
arrived
just
as
they
were
sitting
down
to
tea
or
rather
cocoa
for
with
the
exception
of
bert
all
the
children
expressed
a
preference
for
the
latter
beverage
bert
would
have
liked
to
have
cocoa
also
but
hearing
that
the
were
going
to
have
tea
he
thought
it
would
be
more
manly
to
do
the
same
this
question
of
having
tea
or
cocoa
for
tea
became
a
cause
of
much
uproarious
merriment
on
the
part
of
the
children
who
asked
each
other
repeatedly
which
they
liked
best
tea
or
tea
they
thought
it
so
funny
that
they
said
it
over
and
over
again
screaming
with
laughter
all
the
while
until
tommy
got
a
piece
of
cake
stuck
in
his
throat
and
became
nearly
black
in
the
face
and
then
philpot
had
to
turn
him
upside
down
and
punch
him
in
the
back
to
save
him
from
choking
to
death
this
rather
sobered
the
others
but
for
some
time
afterwards
whenever
they
looked
at
each
other
they
began
to
laugh
afresh
because
they
thought
it
was
such
a
good
joke
when
they
had
filled
themselves
up
with
the
and
cakes
and
bread
and
jam
elsie
linden
and
nellie
newman
helped
to
clear
away
the
cups
and
saucers
and
then
owen
lit
the
candles
on
the
christmas
tree
and
distributed
the
toys
to
the
children
and
a
little
while
afterwards
philpot
who
had
got
a
mask
out
of
one
of
the
started
a
fine
game
pretending
to
be
a
dreadful
wild
animal
which
he
called
a
pandroculus
and
crawling
about
on
all
fours
rolled
his
goggle
eyes
and
growled
out
he
must
have
a
little
boy
or
girl
to
eat
for
his
supper
he
looked
so
terrible
that
although
they
knew
it
was
only
a
joke
they
were
almost
afraid
of
him
and
ran
away
laughing
and
screaming
to
shelter
themselves
behind
nora
or
owen
but
all
the
same
whenever
philpot
left
off
playing
they
entreated
him
to
it
again
and
so
he
had
to
keep
on
being
a
pandroculus
until
exhaustion
compelled
him
to
return
to
his
natural
form
after
this
they
all
sat
round
the
table
and
had
a
game
of
cards
they
called
it
but
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
the
rules
of
the
game
everyone
seemed
to
think
that
the
principal
thing
to
do
was
to
kick
up
as
much
row
as
possible
after
a
while
philpot
suggested
a
change
to
my
neighbour
and
won
quite
a
lot
of
cards
before
they
found
out
that
he
had
hidden
all
the
jacks
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
then
they
mobbed
him
for
a
cheat
he
might
have
been
seriously
injured
if
it
had
not
been
for
bert
who
created
a
diversion
by
standing
on
a
chair
and
announcing
that
he
was
about
to
introduce
to
their
notice
white
pandorama
as
exhibited
before
all
the
nobility
and
crowned
heads
of
europe
england
ireland
and
scotland
including
north
america
and
wales
loud
cheers
greeted
the
conclusion
of
bert
speech
the
box
was
placed
on
the
table
which
was
then
moved
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
the
chairs
were
ranged
in
two
rows
in
front
the
consisted
of
a
made
of
painted
cardboard
and
fixed
on
the
front
of
a
wooden
box
about
three
feet
long
by
two
feet
six
inches
high
and
about
one
foot
deep
from
back
to
front
the
was
a
lot
of
pictures
cut
out
of
illustrated
weekly
papers
and
pasted
together
end
to
end
so
as
to
form
a
long
strip
or
ribbon
bert
had
coloured
all
the
pictures
with
just
behind
the
wings
of
the
at
each
end
of
the
box
was
an
upright
roller
and
the
long
strip
of
pictures
was
rolled
up
on
this
the
upper
ends
of
the
rollers
came
through
the
top
of
the
box
and
had
handles
attached
to
them
when
these
handles
were
turned
the
pictures
passed
across
the
stage
unrolling
from
one
roller
and
rolling
on
to
the
other
and
were
illuminated
by
the
light
of
three
candles
placed
behind
the
idea
of
constructing
this
machine
had
been
suggested
to
bert
by
a
panorama
entertainment
he
had
been
to
see
some
time
before
style
of
the
decorations
he
remarked
alluding
to
the
painted
moorish
he
lit
the
candles
at
the
back
of
the
stage
and
having
borrowed
a
from
nora
desired
the
audience
to
take
their
seats
when
they
had
all
done
so
he
requested
owen
to
put
out
the
lamp
and
the
candles
on
the
tree
and
then
he
made
another
speech
imitating
the
manner
of
the
lecturer
at
the
panorama
entertainment
before
mentioned
and
gentlemen

your
kind
permission

large
ship

on
the
point
of
foundering

running
mountains
high
and
the
inky
clouds
were
riven
by
forked
lightning
to
increase
the
terrifying
effect

rattled
the
tea

played
bay
of
biscay

the

to
parlimint
and
promisin
to
do
something
or
other
to
make
things
better
for
the
lower
horders
as
an
appropriate
selection
to
go
with
this
picture
bert
played
the
tune
of
a
popular
song
the
words
being
well
known
to
the
children
who
sang
enthusiastically
clapping
their
hands
and
stamping
their
feet
on
the
floor
in
time
with
the
music
both
been
there
before
many
a
time
many
a
time
we
both
been
there
before
many
a
time
where
many
a
gallon
of
beer
has
gone
to
colour
his
nose
and
mine
we
both
been
there
before
many
a
time
many
a
time
at
the
conclusion
of
the
singing
bert
turned
another
picture
into
view
we
another
election
scene
at
each
side
we
see
the
two
candidates
the
same
as
in
the
last
pitcher
in
the
middle
of
the
road
we
see
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
covered
with
blood
with
a
lot
of
liberal
and
tory
working
men
kickin
jumpin
on
and
on
face
with
their
boots
the
bloke
on
the
ground
is
a
socialist
and
the
reason
why
they
kickin
face
in
is
because
said
that
the
only
difference
between
slumrent
and
mandriver
was
that
they
was
both
alike
while
the
audience
were
admiring
this
picture
bert
played
another
tune
and
the
children
sang
the
words
lovely
black
eyes
oh
what
a
surprise
only
for
telling
a
man
he
was
wrong
two
lovely
black
eyes
bert
continued
to
turn
the
handles
of
the
rollers
and
a
long
succession
of
pictures
passed
across
the
stage
to
the
delight
of
the
children
who
cheered
and
sang
as
occasion
demanded
but
the
most
enthusiastic
outburst
of
all
greeted
the
appearance
of
the
final
picture
which
was
a
portrait
of
the
king
directly
the
children
saw
it
without
waiting
for
the
band
they
gave
three
cheers
and
began
to
sing
the
chorus
of
the
national
anthem
a
round
of
applause
for
bert
concluded
the
pandorama
performance
the
lamp
and
the
candles
of
the
christmas
tree
were
relit
for
although
all
the
toys
had
been
taken
off
the
tree
still
made
a
fine
show
with
the
shining
glass
ornaments
and
then
they
had
some
more
games
blind
buff
a
in
which
philpot
was
defeated
with
great
laughter
and
a
lot
of
other
games
and
when
they
were
tired
of
these
each
child
a
piece
or
sung
a
song
learnt
specially
for
the
occasion
the
only
one
who
had
not
come
prepared
in
this
respect
was
little
rosie
and
even
she
so
as
to
be
the
same
as
the
others
insisted
on
reciting
the
only
piece
she
knew
kneeling
on
the
hearthrug
she
put
her
hands
together
palm
to
palm
and
shutting
her
eyes
very
tightly
she
repeated
the
verse
she
always
said
every
night
before
going
to
bed
jesus
meek
and
mild
look
on
me
a
little
child
pity
my
simplicity
suffer
me
to
come
to
thee
then
she
stood
up
and
kissed
everyone
in
turn
and
philpot
crossed
over
and
began
looking
out
of
the
window
and
coughed
and
blew
his
nose
because
a
nut
that
he
had
been
eating
had
gone
down
the
wrong
way
most
of
them
were
by
this
time
quite
tired
out
so
after
some
supper
the
party
broke
up
although
they
were
nearly
all
very
sleepy
none
of
them
were
very
willing
to
go
but
they
were
consoled
by
the
thought
of
another
entertainment
to
which
they
were
going
later
on
in
the
week
the
band
of
hope
tea
and
prize
distribution
at
the
shining
light
chapel
bert
undertook
to
see
elsie
and
charley
safely
home
and
philpot
volunteered
to
accompany
nellie
and
tommy
newman
and
to
carry
rosie
who
was
so
tired
that
she
fell
asleep
on
his
shoulder
before
they
left
the
house
as
they
were
going
down
the
stairs
frankie
held
a
hurried
consultation
with
his
mother
with
the
result
that
he
was
able
to
shout
after
them
an
invitation
to
come
again
next
christmas
chapter
the
brigands
hold
a
council
of
war
it
being
now
what
is
usually
called
the
festive
season
possibly
because
at
this
period
of
the
year
a
greater
number
of
people
are
suffering
from
hunger
and
cold
than
at
any
other
time
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
at
being
invited
to
another
little
party
which
took
place
on
the
day
after
the
one
we
have
just
left
the
scene
was
mr
sweater
office
mr
sweater
was
seated
at
his
desk
but
with
his
chair
swung
round
to
enable
him
to
face
his
guests
messrs
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
who
were
also
seated
will
to
be
done
and
that
very
soon
grinder
was
saying
ca
go
on
much
longer
as
we
doing
at
present
for
my
part
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
chuck
up
the
sponge
at
once
the
company
is
practically
bankrupt
now
and
the
longer
we
waits
the
worser
it
will
be
just
my
opinion
said
didlum
dejectedly
we
could
supply
the
electric
light
at
the
same
price
as
gas
or
a
little
cheaper
we
might
have
some
chance
but
we
ca
do
it
the
fact
is
that
the
machinery
we
got
is
no
dam
good
it
too
small
and
it
wore
out
consequently
the
light
we
supply
is
inferior
to
gas
and
costs
more
i
think
we
fairly
beaten
this
time
said
rushton
even
if
the
gas
coy
had
moved
their
works
beyond
the
borough
boundary
still
we
should
been
hable
to
compete
with
course
not
said
grinder
truth
of
the
matter
is
just
wot
didlum
says
our
machinery
is
too
small
it
worn
hout
and
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
throwed
on
the
so
there
only
one
thing
left
to
do
and
that
is
go
into
liquidation
do
see
it
remarked
sweater
what
do
you
propose
then
demanded
grinder
the
company
ask
the
shareholders
for
more
money
pull
down
the
works
and
build
fresh
and
buy
some
new
machinery
and
then
most
likely
not
make
a
do
of
it
after
all
not
for
me
old
chap
i
enough
you
wo
catch
me
chuckin
good
money
after
bad
in
that
way
me
neither
said
rushton
orf
remarked
didlum
very
decidedly
sweater
laughed
quietly
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suggest
anything
of
that
sort
he
said
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
one
of
the
largest
shareholders
myself
no
what
i
propose
is
that
we
sell
out
out
replied
grinder
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
in
which
the
others
joined
going
to
buy
the
shares
of
a
concern
practically
bankrupt
and
never
paid
a
dividend
tried
to
sell
my
little
lot
several
times
already
said
didlum
with
a
sickly
smile
nobody
wo
buy
to
buy
repeated
sweater
replying
to
grinder
municipality
of
course
the
ratepayers
why
should
mugsborough
go
in
for
socialism
as
well
as
other
towns
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
fairly
gasped
for
breath
the
audacity
of
the
chief
proposal
nearly
paralysed
them
afraid
we
should
never
git
away
with
it
ejaculated
didlum
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
the
people
tumbled
to
it
there
be
no
hend
of
a
row
row
replied
sweater
scornfully
majority
of
the
people
will
never
know
anything
about
it
listen
to
me
you
quite
sure
as
we
ca
be
interrupted
rushton
glancing
nervously
at
the
door
and
round
the
office
all
right
answered
sweater
who
nevertheless
lowered
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
and
the
others
drew
their
chairs
closer
and
bent
forward
to
listen
know
we
still
have
a
little
money
in
hand
well
what
i
propose
is
this
at
the
annual
meeting
which
as
you
know
comes
off
next
week
we
arrange
for
the
secretary
to
read
a
highly
satisfactory
report
and
we
declare
a
dividend
of
per
cent
we
can
arrange
it
somehow
between
us
of
course
we
have
to
cook
the
accounts
a
little
but
i
see
that
it
done
properly
the
other
shareholders
are
not
going
to
ask
any
awkward
questions
and
we
all
understand
each
other
sweater
paused
and
regarded
the
other
three
brigands
intently
you
follow
me
he
asked
yes
said
didlum
eagerly
on
with
it
and
rushton
and
grinder
nodded
assent
resumed
sweater
arrange
for
a
good
report
of
the
meeting
to
appear
in
the
weekly
ananias
i
instruct
the
editor
to
write
it
himself
and
i
tell
him
just
what
to
say
i
also
get
him
to
write
a
leading
article
about
it
saying
that
electricity
is
sure
to
supersede
gas
for
lighting
purposes
in
the
very
near
future
then
the
article
will
go
on
to
refer
to
the
huge
profits
made
by
the
gas
coy
and
to
say
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
the
town
had
bought
the
gasworks
years
ago
so
that
those
profits
might
have
been
used
to
reduce
the
rates
the
same
as
has
been
done
in
other
towns
finally
the
article
will
declare
that
it
a
great
pity
that
the
electric
light
supply
should
be
in
the
hands
of
a
private
company
and
to
suggest
that
an
effort
be
made
to
acquire
it
for
the
town
the
meantime
we
can
all
go
about
in
a
very
quiet
and
judicious
way
of
course
bragging
about
what
a
good
thing
we
got
and
saying
we
do
mean
to
sell
we
shall
say
that
we
overcome
all
the
initial
expenses
and
difficulties
connected
with
the
installation
of
the
works
that
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
reap
the
reward
of
our
industry
and
enterprise
and
so
on
continued
the
chief
can
arrange
for
it
to
be
proposed
in
the
council
that
the
town
should
purchase
the
electric
light
works
not
by
one
of
us
four
you
know
said
grinder
with
a
cunning
leer
not
that
would
give
the
show
away
at
once
there
are
as
you
know
several
members
of
the
band
who
are
not
shareholders
in
the
company
we
get
some
of
them
to
do
most
of
the
talking
we
being
the
directors
of
the
company
must
pretend
to
be
against
selling
and
stick
out
for
our
own
price
and
when
we
do
finally
consent
we
must
make
out
that
we
are
sacrificing
our
private
interests
for
the
good
of
the
town
we
get
a
committee
appointed
we
have
an
expert
engineer
down
from
london
i
know
a
man
that
will
suit
our
purpose
admirably
we
pay
him
a
trifle
and
he
say
whatever
we
tell
him
to
and
we
rush
the
whole
business
through
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
and
before
the
have
time
to
realize
what
being
done
not
that
we
need
worry
ourselves
much
about
them
most
of
them
take
no
interest
in
public
affairs
but
even
if
there
is
something
said
it
wo
matter
much
to
us
once
we
got
the
money
it
be
a
nine
days
wonder
and
then
we
hear
no
more
of
it
as
the
chief
ceased
speaking
the
other
brigands
also
remained
silent
speechless
with
admiration
of
his
cleverness
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
asked
of
it
cried
grinder
enthusiastically
think
splendid
nothing
could
be
better
if
we
can
honly
git
away
with
it
i
reckon
it
be
one
of
the
smartest
thing
we
ever
done
ai
the
word
for
it
observed
rushton
no
doubt
it
a
grand
idear
exclaimed
didlum
i
just
thought
of
something
else
that
might
be
done
to
help
it
along
we
could
arrange
to
a
lot
of
letters
sent
to
the
editor
of
the
obscurer
and
to
the
editor
of
the
ananias
and
to
the
editor
of
the
weekly
chloroform
in
favour
of
the
scheme
that
a
very
good
idea
said
grinder
that
matter
the
editors
could
write
them
to
themselves
and
sign
them
progress
ratepayer
advance
mugsborough
and
that
all
right
said
the
chief
thoughtfully
we
must
be
careful
not
to
overdo
it
of
course
there
will
have
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
publicity
but
we
do
want
to
create
too
much
interest
in
it
to
think
of
it
observed
rushton
arrogantly
should
we
trouble
ourselves
about
the
opinion
of
the
ratepayers
at
all
why
should
we
trouble
to
fake
the
books
or
declare
a
dividend
or
the
harticles
in
the
papers
or
anything
else
we
got
the
game
in
our
own
we
got
a
majority
in
the
council
and
as
mr
sweater
ses
very
few
people
even
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
reports
of
the
meetings
that
right
enough
said
grinder
it
just
them
few
wot
would
make
a
lot
of
trouble
and
talk
they
the
very
people
we
to
think
about
if
we
can
only
manage
to
put
them
in
a
fog
we
be
all
right
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
as
mr
sweater
proposes
i
think
so
said
the
chief
must
be
very
careful
i
can
work
it
all
right
in
the
ananias
and
the
chloroform
and
of
course
you
see
that
the
obscurer
backs
us
up
take
care
of
that
said
grinder
grimly
the
three
local
papers
were
run
by
limited
companies
sweater
held
nearly
all
the
shares
of
the
ananias
and
of
the
weekly
chloroform
and
controlled
their
policy
and
contents
grinder
occupied
the
same
position
with
regard
to
the
obscurer
the
editors
were
a
sort
of
marionettes
who
danced
as
sweater
and
grinder
pulled
the
strings
wonder
how
dr
weakling
will
take
it
remarked
rushton
the
very
thing
i
was
just
thinkin
about
cried
didlum
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
if
we
could
arrange
to
somebody
took
bad
you
know
fall
down
in
a
fit
or
something
in
the
street
just
outside
the
town
just
before
the
matter
is
brought
forward
in
the
council
and
then
someone
to
come
and
call
out
to
attend
to
the
party
wot
ill
and
keep
out
till
the
business
is
done
that
a
capital
idear
said
grinder
thoughtfully
who
could
we
get
to
the
fit
it
would
to
be
someone
we
could
trust
you
know
about
rushton
you
would
mind
doin
it
would
yer
inquired
didlum
should
strongly
object
said
rushton
haughtily
he
regarded
the
suggestion
that
he
should
act
such
an
undignified
part
as
a
kind
of
sacrilege
i
do
it
meself
if
necessary
said
didlum
not
proud
when
there
money
to
be
made
anything
for
an
honest
living
i
think
we
all
agreed
so
far
remarked
sweater
the
others
signified
assent
i
think
we
all
deserve
a
drink
the
chief
continued
producing
a
decanter
and
a
box
of
cigars
from
a
cupboard
by
the
side
of
his
desk
that
water
bottle
from
behind
you
didlum
suppose
nobody
wo
be
comin
in
said
the
latter
anxiously
a
teetotaler
you
know
it
all
right
said
sweater
taking
four
glasses
out
of
the
cupboard
and
pouring
out
the
whisky
given
orders
that
we
not
to
be
disturbed
for
anyone
say
when
success
to
socialism
cried
grinder
raising
his
glass
and
taking
a
big
drink
i
mean
said
didlum
hastily
correcting
himself
i
likes
about
this
business
is
that
we
not
only
ourselves
a
bit
of
good
continued
grinder
with
a
laugh
not
only
doin
ourselves
a
bit
of
good
but
we
likewise
doin
the
socialists
a
lot
of
when
the
ratepayers
bought
the
works
and
they
begins
to
kick
up
a
row
because
they
losin
money
over
it
we
can
tell
that
it
socialism
and
then
they
say
that
if
that
socialism
they
do
want
no
more
of
it
the
other
brigands
laughed
gleefully
and
some
of
didlum
whisky
went
down
the
wrong
way
and
nearly
sent
him
into
a
fit
might
as
well
kill
a
man
at
once
he
protested
as
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
might
as
well
kill
a
man
at
once
as
choke
to
death
now
i
got
a
bit
of
good
news
for
you
said
the
chief
as
he
put
his
empty
glass
down
the
others
became
serious
at
once
we
had
a
very
rough
time
of
it
in
our
contest
with
the
gasworks
company
and
although
we
got
the
worst
of
it
it
been
all
lavender
for
them
you
know
they
not
enjoyed
themselves
either
we
hit
them
pretty
hard
when
we
put
up
the
coal
dues
damn
good
job
too
said
grinder
malignantly
continued
sweater
just
as
sick
of
the
fight
as
they
want
to
be
because
of
course
they
do
know
exactly
how
badly
been
hit
for
all
they
know
we
could
have
continued
the
struggle
indefinitely
and
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
had
a
talk
with
the
managing
director
and
one
or
two
others
and
they
willing
to
let
us
in
with
them
so
that
we
can
put
the
money
we
get
for
the
electric
light
works
into
gas
shares
this
was
such
splendid
news
that
they
had
another
drink
on
the
strength
of
it
and
didlum
said
that
one
of
the
first
things
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
totally
abolish
the
coal
dues
because
they
pressed
so
hard
on
the
poor
chapter
the
deserter
about
the
end
of
january
slyme
left
easton
the
latter
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
anything
to
do
since
the
work
at
cave
was
finished
and
latterly
the
quality
of
the
food
had
been
falling
off
the
twelve
shillings
slyme
paid
for
his
board
and
lodging
was
all
that
ruth
had
to
keep
house
with
she
had
tried
to
get
some
work
to
do
herself
but
generally
without
success
there
were
one
or
two
jobs
that
she
might
have
had
if
she
had
been
able
to
give
her
whole
time
to
them
but
of
course
that
was
not
possible
the
child
and
the
housework
had
to
be
attended
to
and
slyme
meals
had
to
be
prepared
nevertheless
she
contrived
to
get
away
several
times
when
she
had
a
chance
of
earning
a
few
shillings
by
doing
a
day
charing
for
some
lady
or
other
and
then
she
left
everything
in
such
order
at
home
that
easton
was
able
to
manage
all
right
while
she
was
away
on
these
occasions
she
usually
left
the
baby
with
owen
wife
who
was
an
old
schoolmate
of
hers
nora
was
the
more
willing
to
render
her
this
service
because
frankie
used
to
be
so
highly
delighted
whenever
it
happened
he
never
tired
of
playing
with
the
child
and
for
several
days
afterwards
he
used
to
worry
his
mother
with
entreaties
to
buy
a
baby
of
their
own
easton
earned
a
few
shillings
occasionally
now
and
then
he
got
a
job
to
clean
windows
and
once
or
twice
he
did
a
few
days
or
hours
work
with
some
other
painter
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
little
job
his
own
such
as
a
ceiling
to
wash
and
whiten
or
a
room
or
two
to
paint
but
such
jobs
were
few
sometimes
when
they
were
very
hard
up
they
sold
something
the
bible
that
used
to
lie
on
the
little
table
in
the
bay
window
was
one
of
the
first
things
to
be
parted
with
ruth
erased
the
inscription
from
the
and
then
they
sold
the
book
at
a
shop
for
two
shillings
as
time
went
on
they
sold
nearly
everything
that
was
saleable
except
of
course
the
things
that
were
obtained
on
the
hire
system
slyme
could
see
that
they
were
getting
very
much
into
debt
and
behind
with
the
rent
and
on
two
occasions
already
easton
had
borrowed
five
shillings
from
him
which
he
might
never
be
able
to
pay
back
another
thing
was
that
slyme
was
always
in
fear
that
ruth
who
had
never
wholly
abandoned
herself
to
wrongdoing
might
tell
easton
what
had
happened
more
than
once
she
had
talked
of
doing
so
and
the
principal
reason
why
she
refrained
was
that
she
knew
that
even
if
he
forgave
her
he
could
never
think
the
same
of
her
as
before
slyme
repeatedly
urged
this
view
upon
her
pointing
out
that
no
good
could
result
from
such
a
confession
latterly
the
house
had
become
very
uncomfortable
it
was
not
only
that
the
food
was
bad
and
that
sometimes
there
was
no
fire
but
ruth
and
easton
were
nearly
always
quarrelling
about
something
or
other
she
scarcely
spoke
to
slyme
at
all
and
avoided
sitting
at
the
table
with
him
whenever
possible
he
was
in
constant
dread
that
easton
might
notice
her
manner
towards
him
and
seek
for
some
explanation
altogether
the
situation
was
so
unpleasant
that
slyme
determined
to
clear
out
he
made
the
excuse
that
he
had
been
offered
a
few
work
at
a
place
some
little
distance
outside
the
town
after
he
was
gone
they
lived
for
several
weeks
in
on
what
credit
they
could
get
and
by
selling
the
furniture
or
anything
else
they
possessed
that
could
be
turned
into
money
the
things
out
of
room
were
sold
almost
directly
he
left
chapter
the
veteran
old
jack
linden
had
tried
hard
to
earn
a
little
money
by
selling
bloaters
but
they
often
went
bad
and
even
when
he
managed
to
sell
them
all
the
profit
was
so
slight
that
it
was
not
worth
doing
before
the
work
at
cave
was
finished
philpot
was
a
good
friend
to
them
he
frequently
gave
old
jack
sixpence
or
a
shilling
and
often
brought
a
bag
of
cakes
or
buns
for
the
children
sometimes
he
came
to
tea
with
them
on
sundays
as
an
excuse
for
bringing
a
tin
of
salmon
elsie
and
charley
frequently
went
to
owen
house
to
take
tea
with
frankie
in
fact
whilst
owen
had
anything
to
do
they
almost
lived
there
for
both
owen
and
nora
knowing
that
the
lindens
had
nothing
to
live
on
except
the
earnings
of
the
young
woman
encouraged
the
children
to
come
often
old
jack
made
some
hopeless
attempts
to
get
work
work
of
any
kind
but
nobody
wanted
him
and
to
make
things
worse
his
eyesight
which
had
been
failing
for
a
long
time
became
very
bad
once
he
was
given
a
job
by
a
big
provision
firm
to
carry
an
advertisement
about
the
streets
the
man
who
had
been
carrying
it
before
an
old
soldier
had
been
sacked
the
previous
day
for
getting
drunk
while
on
duty
the
advertisement
was
not
an
ordinary
pair
of
sandwich
boards
but
a
sort
of
box
without
any
bottom
or
lid
a
wooden
frame
four
sides
covered
with
canvas
on
which
were
pasted
printed
bills
advertising
margarine
each
side
of
this
box
or
frame
was
rather
larger
than
an
ordinary
sandwich
board
old
linden
had
to
get
inside
this
thing
and
carry
it
about
the
streets
two
straps
fixed
across
the
top
of
the
frame
and
passing
one
over
each
of
his
shoulders
enabled
him
to
carry
it
it
swayed
about
a
good
deal
as
he
walked
along
especially
when
the
wind
caught
it
but
there
were
two
handles
inside
to
hold
it
steady
by
the
pay
was
eighteenpence
a
day
and
he
had
to
travel
a
certain
route
up
and
down
the
busiest
streets
at
first
the
frame
did
not
feel
very
heavy
but
the
weight
seemed
to
increase
as
the
time
went
on
and
the
straps
hurt
his
shoulders
he
felt
very
much
ashamed
also
whenever
he
encountered
any
of
his
old
mates
some
of
whom
laughed
at
him
in
consequence
of
the
frame
requiring
so
much
attention
to
keep
it
steady
and
being
unused
to
the
work
and
his
sight
so
bad
he
several
times
narrowly
escaped
being
run
over
another
thing
that
added
to
his
embarrassment
was
the
jeering
of
the
other
sandwichmen
the
loafers
outside
the
public
houses
and
the
boys
who
shouted
jack
in
the
box
after
him
sometimes
the
boys
threw
refuse
at
the
frame
and
once
a
decayed
orange
thrown
by
one
of
them
knocked
his
hat
off
by
the
time
evening
came
he
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
for
weariness
his
shoulders
his
legs
and
his
feet
ached
terribly
and
as
he
was
taking
the
thing
back
to
the
shop
he
was
accosted
by
a
ragged
old
man
whose
face
was
inflamed
with
drink
and
fury
was
the
old
soldier
who
had
been
discharged
the
previous
day
he
cursed
and
swore
in
the
most
awful
manner
and
accused
linden
of
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
and
shaking
his
fist
fiercely
at
him
shouted
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
knock
his
face
through
his
head
and
out
of
the
back
of
his
neck
he
might
possibly
have
tried
to
put
this
threat
into
practice
but
for
the
timely
appearance
of
a
policeman
when
he
calmed
down
at
once
and
took
himself
off
jack
did
not
go
back
the
next
day
he
felt
that
he
would
rather
starve
than
have
any
more
of
the
advertisement
frame
and
after
this
he
seemed
to
abandon
all
hope
of
earning
money
wherever
he
went
it
was
the
same
no
one
wanted
him
so
he
just
wandered
about
the
streets
aimlessly
now
and
then
meeting
an
old
workmate
who
asked
him
to
have
a
drink
but
this
was
not
often
for
nearly
all
of
them
were
out
of
work
and
penniless
chapter
the
soldier
children
during
most
of
this
time
jack
linden
had
of
work
making
blouses
and
pinafores
for
sweater
she
had
so
much
to
do
that
one
might
have
thought
that
the
tory
millennium
had
arrived
and
that
tariff
reform
was
already
an
accomplished
fact
she
had
plenty
of
work
at
first
they
had
employed
her
exclusively
on
the
cheapest
kind
of
blouses
those
that
were
paid
for
at
the
rate
of
two
shillings
a
dozen
but
they
did
not
give
her
many
of
that
sort
now
she
did
the
work
so
neatly
that
they
kept
her
busy
on
the
better
qualities
which
did
not
pay
her
so
well
because
although
she
was
paid
more
per
dozen
there
was
a
great
deal
more
work
in
them
than
in
the
cheaper
kinds
once
she
had
a
very
special
one
to
make
for
which
she
was
paid
six
shillings
but
it
took
her
four
and
a
half
days
working
early
and
late
to
do
it
the
lady
who
bought
this
blouse
was
told
that
it
came
from
paris
and
paid
three
guineas
for
it
but
of
course
mrs
linden
knew
nothing
of
that
and
even
if
she
had
known
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
her
most
of
the
money
she
earned
went
to
pay
the
rent
and
sometimes
there
was
only
two
or
three
shillings
left
to
buy
food
for
all
of
them
sometimes
not
even
so
much
because
although
she
had
plenty
of
work
she
was
not
always
able
to
do
it
there
were
times
when
the
strain
of
working
the
machine
was
unendurable
her
shoulders
ached
her
arms
became
cramped
and
her
eyes
pained
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
continue
then
for
a
change
she
would
leave
the
sewing
and
do
some
housework
once
when
they
owed
four
weeks
rent
the
agent
was
so
threatening
that
they
were
terrified
at
the
thought
of
being
sold
up
and
turned
out
of
the
house
and
so
she
decided
to
sell
the
round
mahogany
table
and
some
of
the
other
things
out
of
the
nearly
all
the
furniture
that
was
in
the
house
now
belonged
to
her
and
had
formed
her
home
before
her
husband
died
the
old
people
had
given
most
of
their
things
away
at
different
times
to
their
other
sons
since
she
had
come
to
live
there
these
men
were
all
married
and
all
in
employment
one
was
a
fitter
at
the
gasworks
the
second
was
a
railway
porter
and
the
other
was
a
butcher
but
now
that
the
old
man
was
out
of
work
they
seldom
came
to
the
house
the
last
time
they
had
been
there
was
on
christmas
eve
and
then
there
had
been
such
a
terrible
row
between
them
that
the
children
had
been
awakened
by
it
and
frightened
nearly
out
of
their
lives
the
cause
of
the
row
was
that
some
time
previously
they
had
mutually
agreed
to
each
give
a
shilling
a
week
to
the
old
people
they
had
done
this
for
three
weeks
and
after
that
the
butcher
had
stopped
his
contribution
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
expected
to
help
to
keep
his
brother
widow
and
her
children
if
the
old
people
liked
to
give
up
the
house
and
go
to
live
in
a
room
somewhere
by
themselves
he
would
continue
paying
his
shilling
a
week
but
not
otherwise
upon
this
the
railway
porter
and
the
also
ceased
paying
they
said
it
was
fair
that
they
should
pay
a
shilling
a
week
each
when
the
butcher
who
was
the
eldest
and
earned
the
best
wages
paid
nothing
provided
he
paid
they
would
pay
but
if
he
did
pay
anything
neither
would
they
on
christmas
eve
they
all
happened
to
come
to
the
house
at
the
same
time
each
denounced
the
others
and
after
nearly
coming
to
blows
they
all
went
away
raging
and
cursing
and
had
not
been
near
the
place
since
as
soon
as
she
decided
to
sell
the
things
mary
went
to
furniture
store
and
the
manager
said
he
would
ask
mr
didlum
to
call
and
see
the
table
and
other
articles
she
waited
anxiously
all
the
morning
but
he
did
not
appear
so
she
went
once
more
to
the
shop
to
remind
him
when
he
did
come
at
last
he
was
very
contemptuous
of
the
table
and
of
everything
else
she
offered
to
sell
five
shillings
was
the
very
most
he
could
think
of
giving
for
the
table
and
even
then
he
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
get
his
money
back
eventually
he
gave
her
thirty
shillings
for
the
table
the
overmantel
the
easy
chair
three
other
chairs
and
the
two
best
pictures
one
a
large
steel
engraving
of
good
samaritan
and
the
other
blessing
little
children
he
paid
the
money
at
once
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
van
came
to
take
the
things
away
and
when
they
were
gone
mary
sank
down
on
the
hearthrug
in
the
wrecked
room
and
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
this
was
the
first
of
several
similar
transactions
slowly
piece
by
piece
in
order
to
buy
food
and
to
pay
the
rent
the
furniture
was
sold
every
time
didlum
came
he
affected
to
be
doing
them
a
very
great
favour
by
buying
the
things
at
all
almost
an
act
of
charity
he
did
not
want
them
business
was
so
bad
it
might
be
years
before
he
could
sell
them
again
and
so
on
once
or
twice
he
asked
mary
if
she
did
not
want
to
sell
the
clock
the
one
that
her
late
husband
had
made
for
his
mother
but
mary
shrank
from
the
thought
of
selling
this
until
at
last
there
was
nothing
else
left
that
didlum
would
buy
and
one
week
when
mary
was
too
ill
to
do
any
needlework
it
had
to
go
he
gave
them
ten
shillings
for
it
mary
had
expected
the
old
woman
to
be
heartbroken
at
having
to
part
with
this
clock
but
she
was
surprised
to
see
her
almost
indifferent
the
truth
was
that
lately
both
the
old
people
seemed
stunned
and
incapable
of
taking
an
intelligent
interest
in
what
was
happening
around
them
and
mary
had
to
attend
to
everything
from
time
to
time
nearly
all
their
other
possessions
things
of
inferior
value
that
didlum
would
not
look
at
she
carried
out
and
sold
at
small
shops
in
back
streets
or
pledged
at
the
the
feather
pillows
sheets
and
blankets
bits
of
carpet
or
oilcloth
and
as
much
of
their
clothing
as
was
saleable
or
pawnable
they
felt
the
loss
of
the
bedclothes
more
than
anything
else
for
although
all
the
clothes
they
wore
during
the
day
and
all
the
old
clothes
and
dresses
in
the
house
and
even
an
old
coloured
tablecloth
were
put
on
the
beds
at
night
they
did
not
compensate
for
the
blankets
and
they
were
often
unable
to
sleep
on
account
of
the
intense
cold
a
lady
district
visitor
who
called
occasionally
sometimes
gave
mary
an
order
for
a
hundredweight
of
coal
or
a
shillingsworth
of
groceries
or
a
ticket
for
a
quart
of
soup
which
elsie
fetched
in
the
evening
from
the
soup
kitchen
but
this
was
not
very
often
because
as
the
lady
said
there
were
so
many
cases
similar
to
theirs
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
more
than
a
very
little
for
any
one
of
them
sometimes
mary
became
so
weak
and
exhausted
through
overwork
worry
and
lack
of
proper
food
that
she
broke
down
altogether
for
the
time
being
and
positively
could
not
do
any
work
at
all
then
she
used
to
lie
down
on
the
bed
in
her
room
and
cry
whenever
she
became
like
this
elsie
and
charley
used
to
do
the
housework
when
they
came
home
from
school
and
make
tea
and
toast
for
her
and
bring
it
to
the
bedside
on
a
chair
so
that
she
could
eat
lying
down
when
there
was
no
margarine
or
dripping
to
put
on
the
toast
they
made
it
very
thin
and
crisp
and
pretended
it
was
biscuit
the
children
rather
enjoyed
these
times
the
quiet
and
leisure
was
so
different
from
other
days
when
their
mother
was
so
busy
she
had
no
time
to
speak
to
them
they
would
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
the
old
grandmother
in
her
chair
opposite
with
the
cat
beside
her
listening
to
the
conversation
and
purring
or
mewing
whenever
they
stroked
it
or
spoke
to
it
they
talked
principally
of
the
future
elsie
said
she
was
going
to
be
a
teacher
and
earn
a
lot
of
money
to
bring
home
to
her
mother
to
buy
things
with
charley
was
thinking
of
opening
a
grocer
shop
and
having
a
horse
and
cart
when
one
has
a
grocer
shop
there
is
always
plenty
to
eat
even
if
you
have
no
money
you
can
take
as
much
as
you
like
out
of
your
shop
good
stuff
too
tins
of
salmon
jam
sardines
eggs
cakes
biscuits
and
all
those
sorts
of
things
and
one
was
almost
certain
to
have
some
money
every
day
because
it
was
likely
that
a
whole
day
would
go
by
without
someone
or
other
coming
into
the
shop
to
buy
something
when
delivering
the
groceries
with
the
horse
and
cart
he
would
give
rides
to
all
the
boys
he
knew
and
in
the
summertime
after
the
work
was
done
and
the
shop
shut
up
mother
and
elsie
and
granny
could
also
come
for
long
rides
into
the
country
the
old
grandmother
who
had
latterly
become
quite
childish
used
to
sit
and
listen
to
all
this
talk
with
a
superior
air
sometimes
she
argued
with
the
children
about
their
plans
and
ridiculed
them
she
used
to
say
with
a
chuckle
that
she
had
heard
people
talk
like
that
before
lots
of
times
but
it
never
came
to
nothing
in
the
end
one
week
about
the
middle
of
february
when
they
were
in
very
sore
straits
indeed
old
jack
applied
to
the
secretary
of
the
organized
benevolence
society
for
assistance
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
morning
when
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
where
the
office
of
the
society
was
situated
and
saw
a
crowd
of
about
thirty
men
waiting
for
the
doors
to
be
opened
in
order
to
apply
for
soup
tickets
some
of
these
men
were
of
the
tramp
or
the
drunken
loafer
class
some
were
old
workmen
like
himself
and
others
were
labourers
wearing
corduroy
or
moleskin
trousers
with
straps
round
their
legs
under
their
knees
linden
waited
at
a
distance
until
all
these
were
gone
before
he
went
in
the
secretary
received
him
sympathetically
and
gave
him
a
big
form
to
fill
up
but
as
linden
eyes
were
so
bad
and
his
hand
so
unsteady
the
secretary
very
obligingly
wrote
in
the
answers
himself
and
informed
him
that
he
would
inquire
into
the
case
and
lay
his
application
before
the
committee
at
the
next
meeting
which
was
to
be
held
on
the
following
thursday
it
was
then
monday
linden
explained
to
him
that
they
were
actually
starving
he
had
been
out
of
work
for
sixteen
weeks
and
during
all
that
time
they
had
lived
for
the
most
part
on
the
earnings
of
his
but
she
had
not
done
anything
for
nearly
a
fortnight
now
because
the
firm
she
worked
for
had
not
had
any
work
for
her
to
do
there
was
no
food
in
the
house
and
the
children
were
crying
for
something
to
eat
all
last
week
they
had
been
going
to
school
hungry
for
they
had
had
nothing
but
dry
bread
and
tea
every
day
but
this
week
as
far
as
he
could
see
they
would
not
get
even
that
after
some
further
talk
the
secretary
gave
him
two
soup
tickets
and
an
order
for
a
loaf
of
bread
and
repeated
his
promise
to
inquire
into
the
case
and
bring
it
before
the
committee
as
jack
was
returning
home
he
passed
the
soup
kitchen
where
he
saw
the
same
lot
of
men
who
had
been
to
the
office
of
the
organized
benevolence
society
for
the
soup
tickets
they
were
waiting
in
a
long
line
to
be
admitted
the
premises
being
so
small
the
proprietor
served
them
in
batches
of
ten
at
a
time
on
wednesday
the
secretary
called
at
the
house
and
on
friday
jack
received
a
letter
from
him
to
the
effect
that
the
case
had
been
duly
considered
by
the
committee
who
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
as
it
was
a
case
they
were
unable
to
deal
with
it
and
advised
him
to
apply
to
the
board
of
guardians
this
was
what
linden
had
hitherto
shrunk
from
doing
but
the
situation
was
desperate
they
owed
five
weeks
rent
and
to
crown
their
misfortune
his
eyesight
had
become
so
bad
that
even
if
there
had
been
any
prospect
of
obtaining
work
it
was
very
doubtful
if
he
could
have
managed
to
do
it
so
linden
feeling
utterly
crushed
and
degraded
swallowed
all
that
remained
of
his
pride
and
went
like
a
beaten
dog
to
see
the
relieving
officer
who
took
him
before
the
board
who
did
not
think
it
a
suitable
case
for
and
after
some
preliminaries
it
was
arranged
that
linden
and
his
wife
were
to
go
into
the
workhouse
and
mary
was
to
be
allowed
three
shillings
a
week
to
help
her
to
support
herself
and
the
two
children
as
for
linden
sons
the
guardians
intimated
their
intention
of
compelling
them
to
contribute
towards
the
cost
of
their
maintenance
mary
accompanied
the
old
people
to
the
gates
of
their
future
and
when
she
returned
home
she
found
there
a
letter
addressed
to
linden
it
was
from
the
house
agent
and
contained
a
notice
to
leave
the
house
before
the
end
of
the
ensuing
week
nothing
was
said
about
the
rent
that
was
due
perhaps
mr
sweater
thought
that
as
he
had
already
received
nearly
six
hundred
pounds
in
rent
from
linden
he
could
afford
to
be
generous
about
the
five
weeks
that
were
still
owing
or
perhaps
he
thought
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
the
money
however
that
may
have
been
there
was
no
reference
to
it
in
the
letter
it
was
simply
a
notice
to
clear
out
addressed
to
linden
but
meant
for
mary
it
was
about
half
past
three
in
the
afternoon
when
she
returned
home
and
found
this
letter
on
the
floor
in
the
front
passage
she
was
faint
with
fatigue
and
hunger
for
she
had
had
nothing
but
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
bread
that
day
and
her
fare
had
not
been
much
better
for
many
weeks
past
the
children
were
at
school
and
the
house
now
almost
destitute
of
furniture
and
without
carpets
or
oilcloth
on
the
floors
was
deserted
and
cold
and
silent
as
a
tomb
on
the
kitchen
table
were
a
few
cracked
cups
and
saucers
a
broken
knife
some
lead
teaspoons
a
part
of
a
loaf
a
small
basin
containing
some
dripping
and
a
brown
earthenware
teapot
with
a
broken
spout
near
the
table
were
two
broken
kitchen
chairs
one
with
the
top
gone
from
the
back
and
the
other
with
no
back
to
the
seat
at
all
the
bareness
of
the
walls
was
relieved
only
by
a
coloured
almanac
and
some
paper
pictures
which
the
children
had
tacked
upon
them
and
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
was
the
empty
wicker
chair
where
the
old
woman
used
to
sit
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
and
the
cold
hearth
was
untidy
with
an
accumulation
of
ashes
for
during
the
trouble
of
these
last
few
days
she
had
not
had
time
or
heart
to
do
any
housework
the
floor
was
unswept
and
littered
with
scraps
of
paper
and
dust
in
one
corner
was
a
heap
of
twigs
and
small
branches
of
trees
that
charley
had
found
somewhere
and
brought
home
for
the
fire
the
same
disorder
prevailed
all
through
the
house
all
the
doors
were
open
and
from
where
she
stood
in
the
kitchen
she
could
see
the
bed
she
shared
with
elsie
with
its
heterogeneous
heap
of
coverings
the
contained
nothing
but
a
collection
of
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
which
belonged
to
charley
his
as
he
called
them
bits
of
wood
string
and
rope
one
wheel
of
a
perambulator
a
top
an
iron
hoop
and
so
on
through
the
other
door
was
visible
the
dilapidated
bedstead
that
had
been
used
by
the
old
people
with
a
similar
lot
of
bedclothes
to
those
on
her
own
bed
and
the
torn
ragged
covering
of
the
mattress
through
the
side
of
which
the
flock
was
protruding
and
falling
in
particles
on
to
the
floor
as
she
stood
there
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
faint
and
weary
in
the
midst
of
all
this
desolation
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
whole
world
were
falling
to
pieces
and
crumbling
away
all
around
her
chapter
the
beginning
of
the
end
during
the
months
of
january
and
february
owen
crass
slyme
and
sawkins
continued
to
work
at
irregular
intervals
for
rushton
although
even
when
there
was
anything
to
do
they
now
put
in
only
six
hours
a
day
commencing
in
the
morning
and
leaving
off
at
four
with
an
hour
interval
for
dinner
between
twelve
and
one
they
finished
the
and
painted
the
front
of
rushton
shop
when
all
this
was
completed
as
no
other
work
came
in
they
all
had
to
off
with
the
exception
of
sawkins
who
was
kept
on
because
he
was
cheap
and
able
to
do
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
such
as
unstopping
drains
repairing
leaky
roofs
rough
painting
or
and
he
was
also
useful
as
a
labourer
for
the
plumbers
of
whom
there
were
now
three
employed
at
rushton
the
severe
weather
which
had
come
in
with
january
having
made
a
lot
of
work
in
that
trade
with
the
exception
of
this
one
branch
practically
all
work
was
at
a
standstill
during
this
time
rushton
had
had
several
jobs
to
do
and
crass
always
did
the
polishing
of
the
coffins
on
these
occasions
besides
assisting
to
take
the
home
when
finished
and
to
the
corpse
and
afterwards
he
always
acted
as
one
of
the
bearers
at
the
funerals
for
an
ordinary
class
funeral
he
usually
put
in
about
three
hours
for
the
polishing
that
came
to
one
and
nine
taking
home
the
coffin
and
lifting
in
the
corpse
one
shilling
usually
there
were
two
men
to
do
this
besides
hunter
who
always
accompanied
them
to
superintend
the
work
attending
the
funeral
and
acting
as
bearer
four
shillings
so
that
altogether
crass
made
six
shillings
and
ninepence
out
of
each
funeral
and
sometimes
a
little
more
for
instance
when
there
was
an
unusually
corpse
they
had
a
double
coffin
and
then
of
course
there
were
two
in
for
the
shell
was
taken
home
first
and
the
outer
coffin
perhaps
a
day
or
two
later
this
made
another
shilling
no
matter
how
expensive
the
funeral
was
the
bearers
never
got
any
more
money
sometimes
the
carpenter
and
crass
were
able
to
charge
an
hour
or
two
more
on
the
making
and
polishing
of
a
coffin
for
a
good
job
but
that
was
all
sometimes
when
there
was
a
very
cheap
job
they
were
paid
only
three
shillings
for
attending
as
bearers
but
this
was
not
often
as
a
rule
they
got
the
same
amount
whether
it
was
a
cheap
funeral
or
an
expensive
one
slyme
earned
only
five
shillings
out
of
each
funeral
and
owen
only
one
and
six
for
writing
the
coffin
plate
sometimes
there
were
three
or
four
funerals
in
a
week
and
then
crass
did
very
well
indeed
he
still
had
the
two
young
men
lodgers
at
his
house
and
although
one
of
them
was
out
of
work
he
was
still
able
to
pay
his
way
because
he
had
some
money
in
the
bank
one
of
the
funeral
jobs
led
to
a
terrible
row
between
crass
and
sawkins
the
corpse
was
that
of
a
woman
who
had
been
ill
for
a
long
time
with
cancer
of
the
stomach
and
after
the
funeral
rushton
had
to
clean
and
repaint
and
paper
the
room
she
had
occupied
during
her
illness
although
cancer
is
not
supposed
to
be
an
infectious
disease
they
had
orders
to
take
all
the
bedding
away
and
have
it
burnt
sawkins
was
instructed
to
take
a
truck
to
the
house
and
get
the
bedding
and
take
it
to
the
town
refuse
destructor
to
be
destroyed
there
were
two
feather
beds
a
bolster
and
two
pillows
they
were
such
good
things
that
sawkins
secretly
resolved
that
instead
of
taking
them
to
the
destructor
he
would
take
them
to
a
dealer
and
sell
them
as
he
was
coming
away
from
the
house
with
the
things
he
met
hunter
who
told
him
that
he
wanted
him
for
some
other
work
so
he
was
to
take
the
truck
to
the
yard
and
leave
it
there
for
the
present
he
could
take
the
bedding
to
the
destructor
later
on
in
the
day
sawkins
did
as
hunter
ordered
and
in
the
meantime
crass
who
happened
to
be
working
at
the
yard
painting
some
venetian
blinds
saw
the
things
on
the
truck
and
hearing
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
he
also
thought
it
was
a
pity
that
such
good
things
should
be
destroyed
so
when
sawkins
came
in
the
afternoon
to
take
them
away
crass
told
him
he
need
not
trouble
goin
to
that
lot
he
said
too
good
to
chuck
away
there
nothing
wrong
with
this
did
not
suit
sawkins
at
all
he
said
he
had
been
told
to
take
them
to
the
destructor
and
he
was
going
to
do
so
he
was
dragging
the
cart
out
of
the
yard
when
crass
rushed
up
and
lifted
the
bundle
off
and
carried
it
into
the
sawkins
ran
after
him
and
they
began
to
curse
and
swear
at
each
other
crass
accusing
sawkins
of
intending
to
take
the
things
to
the
marine
stores
and
sell
them
sawkins
seized
hold
of
the
bundle
with
the
object
of
replacing
it
on
the
cart
but
crass
got
hold
of
it
as
well
and
they
had
a
tussle
for
it
a
kind
of
tug
of
war
reeling
and
struggling
all
over
the
shop
cursing
and
swearing
horribly
all
the
time
finally
sawkins
being
the
better
man
of
the
two
succeeded
in
wrenching
the
bundle
away
and
put
it
on
the
cart
again
and
then
crass
hurriedly
put
on
his
coat
and
said
he
was
going
to
the
office
to
ask
mr
rushton
if
he
might
have
the
things
upon
hearing
this
sawkins
became
so
infuriated
that
he
lifted
the
bundle
off
the
cart
and
throwing
it
upon
the
muddy
ground
right
into
a
pool
of
dirty
water
trampled
it
underfoot
and
then
taking
out
his
clasp
knife
began
savagely
hacking
and
ripping
the
ticking
so
that
the
feathers
all
came
falling
out
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
damaged
the
things
beyond
hope
of
repair
while
crass
stood
by
white
and
trembling
watching
the
proceedings
but
lacking
the
courage
to
interfere
go
to
the
office
and
ask
rushton
for
if
you
like
shouted
sawkins
can
now
if
you
want
crass
made
no
answer
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
went
back
to
his
work
and
sawkins
piled
the
things
on
the
cart
once
more
and
took
them
away
to
the
destructor
he
would
not
be
able
to
sell
them
now
but
at
any
rate
he
had
stopped
that
dirty
swine
crass
from
getting
them
when
crass
went
back
to
the
he
found
there
one
of
the
pillows
which
had
fallen
out
of
the
bundle
during
the
struggle
he
took
it
home
with
him
that
evening
and
slept
upon
it
it
was
a
fine
pillow
much
fuller
and
softer
and
more
cosy
than
the
one
he
had
been
accustomed
to
a
few
days
afterwards
when
he
was
working
at
the
room
where
the
woman
died
they
gave
him
some
other
things
that
had
belonged
to
her
to
do
away
with
and
amongst
them
was
a
kind
of
wrap
of
grey
knitted
wool
crass
kept
this
for
himself
it
was
just
the
thing
to
wrap
round
neck
when
going
to
work
on
a
cold
morning
and
he
used
it
for
that
purpose
all
through
the
winter
in
addition
to
the
funerals
there
was
a
little
other
work
sometimes
a
room
or
two
to
be
painted
and
papered
and
ceilings
whitened
and
once
they
had
the
outside
of
two
small
cottages
to
paint
doors
and
windows
two
coats
all
four
of
them
worked
at
this
job
and
it
was
finished
in
two
days
and
so
they
went
on
some
weeks
crass
earned
a
pound
or
eighteen
shillings
sometimes
a
little
more
generally
less
and
occasionally
nothing
at
all
there
was
a
lot
of
jealousy
and
amongst
them
about
the
work
slyme
and
crass
were
both
aggrieved
about
sawkins
whenever
they
were
idle
especially
if
the
latter
were
painting
or
whitewashing
and
their
indignation
was
shared
by
all
the
others
who
were
harlow
swore
horribly
about
it
and
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
disgraceful
that
a
bloody
labourer
should
be
employed
doing
what
ought
to
be
skilled
work
for
fivepence
an
hour
while
properly
qualified
men
were
about
these
other
men
were
also
incensed
against
slyme
and
crass
because
the
latter
were
given
the
preference
whenever
there
was
a
little
job
to
do
and
it
was
darkly
insinuated
that
in
order
to
secure
this
preference
these
two
were
working
for
sixpence
an
hour
there
was
no
love
lost
between
crass
and
slyme
either
crass
was
furious
whenever
it
happened
that
slyme
had
a
few
hours
work
to
do
if
he
himself
were
idle
and
if
ever
crass
was
working
while
slyme
was
the
latter
went
about
amongst
the
other
unemployed
men
saying
ugly
things
about
crass
whom
he
accused
of
being
a
owen
also
came
in
for
his
share
of
abuse
and
blame
most
of
them
said
that
a
man
like
him
should
stick
out
for
higher
wages
whether
employed
on
special
work
or
not
and
then
he
would
not
get
any
preference
but
all
the
same
whatever
they
said
about
each
other
behind
each
other
backs
they
were
all
most
friendly
to
each
other
when
they
met
face
to
face
once
or
twice
owen
did
some
work
such
as
graining
a
door
or
writing
a
sign
for
one
or
other
of
his
fellow
workmen
who
had
managed
to
secure
a
little
job
his
own
but
putting
it
all
together
the
and
other
work
at
rushton
and
all
his
earnings
had
not
averaged
ten
shillings
a
week
for
the
last
six
weeks
often
they
had
no
coal
and
sometimes
not
even
a
penny
to
put
into
the
gas
meter
and
then
having
nothing
left
good
enough
to
pawn
he
sometimes
obtained
a
few
pence
by
selling
some
of
his
books
to
book
dealers
however
bad
as
their
condition
was
owen
knew
that
they
were
better
off
than
the
majority
of
the
others
for
whenever
he
went
out
he
was
certain
to
meet
numbers
of
men
whom
he
had
worked
with
at
different
times
who
said
some
of
them
that
they
had
been
idle
for
ten
twelve
fifteen
and
in
some
cases
for
twenty
weeks
without
having
earned
a
shilling
owen
used
to
wonder
how
they
managed
to
continue
to
exist
most
of
them
were
wearing
other
people
clothes
hats
and
boots
which
had
in
some
instances
been
given
to
their
wives
by
ladies
or
by
the
people
at
whose
houses
their
wives
went
to
work
charing
as
for
food
most
of
them
lived
on
such
credit
as
they
could
get
and
on
the
scraps
of
broken
victuals
and
meat
that
their
wives
brought
home
from
the
places
they
worked
at
some
of
them
had
sons
and
daughters
who
still
lived
with
them
and
whose
earnings
kept
their
homes
together
and
the
wives
of
some
of
them
eked
out
a
miserable
existence
by
letting
lodgings
the
week
before
old
linden
went
into
the
workhouse
owen
earned
nothing
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
grocer
from
whom
they
usually
bought
their
things
suddenly
refused
to
let
them
have
any
more
credit
owen
went
to
see
him
and
the
man
said
he
was
very
sorry
but
he
could
not
let
them
have
anything
more
without
the
money
he
did
not
mind
waiting
a
few
weeks
for
what
was
already
owing
but
he
could
not
let
the
amount
get
any
higher
his
books
were
full
of
bad
debts
already
in
conclusion
he
said
that
he
hoped
owen
would
not
do
as
so
many
others
had
done
and
take
his
ready
money
elsewhere
people
came
and
got
credit
from
him
when
they
were
hard
up
and
afterwards
spent
their
ready
money
at
the
monopole
company
stores
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
because
their
goods
were
a
trifle
cheaper
and
it
was
not
fair
owen
admitted
that
it
was
not
fair
but
reminded
him
that
they
always
bought
their
things
at
his
shop
the
grocer
however
was
inexorable
he
repeated
several
times
that
his
books
were
full
of
bad
debts
and
his
own
creditors
were
pressing
him
during
their
conversation
the
shopkeeper
eyes
wandered
continually
to
the
big
store
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
huge
gilded
letters
of
the
name
stores
seemed
to
have
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
once
he
interrupted
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
point
out
to
owen
a
little
girl
who
was
just
coming
out
of
the
stores
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
father
owes
me
nearly
thirty
shillings
he
said
they
spend
their
ready
money
there
the
front
of
the
grocer
shop
badly
needed
repainting
and
the
name
on
the
fascia
smallman
was
so
faded
as
to
be
almost
indecipherable
it
had
been
owen
intention
to
offer
to
do
this
work
the
cost
to
go
against
his
account
but
the
man
appeared
to
be
so
harassed
that
owen
refrained
from
making
the
suggestion
they
still
had
credit
at
the
baker
but
they
did
not
take
much
bread
when
one
has
had
scarcely
anything
else
but
bread
to
eat
for
nearly
a
month
one
finds
it
difficult
to
eat
at
all
that
same
day
when
he
returned
home
after
his
interview
with
the
grocer
they
had
a
loaf
of
beautiful
fresh
bread
but
none
of
them
could
eat
it
although
they
were
hungry
it
seemed
to
stick
in
their
throats
and
they
could
not
swallow
it
even
with
the
help
of
a
drink
of
tea
but
they
drank
the
tea
which
was
the
one
thing
that
enabled
them
to
go
on
living
the
next
week
owen
earned
eight
shillings
altogether
a
few
hours
he
put
in
assisting
crass
to
wash
off
and
whiten
a
ceiling
and
paint
a
room
and
there
was
one
he
wrote
the
latter
at
home
and
while
he
was
doing
it
he
heard
frankie
who
was
out
in
the
scullery
with
nora
say
to
her
how
many
more
days
to
you
think
we
have
to
have
only
dry
bread
and
tea
owen
heart
seemed
to
stop
as
he
heard
the
child
question
and
listened
for
nora
answer
but
the
question
was
not
to
be
answered
at
all
just
then
for
at
that
moment
they
heard
someone
running
up
the
stairs
and
presently
the
door
was
unceremoniously
thrown
open
and
charley
linden
rushed
into
the
house
out
of
breath
hatless
and
crying
piteously
his
clothes
were
old
and
ragged
they
had
been
patched
at
the
knees
and
elbows
but
the
patches
were
tearing
away
from
the
rotting
fabric
into
which
they
had
been
sewn
he
had
on
a
pair
of
black
stockings
full
of
holes
through
which
the
skin
was
showing
the
soles
of
his
boots
were
worn
through
at
one
side
right
to
the
uppers
and
as
he
walked
the
sides
of
his
bare
heels
came
into
contact
with
the
floor
the
front
part
of
the
sole
of
one
boot
was
separated
from
the
upper
and
his
bare
toes
red
with
cold
and
covered
with
mud
protruded
through
the
gap
some
sharp
substance
a
nail
or
a
piece
of
glass
or
flint
had
evidently
lacerated
his
right
foot
for
blood
was
oozing
from
the
broken
heel
of
his
boot
on
to
the
floor
they
were
unable
to
make
much
sense
of
the
confused
story
he
told
them
through
his
sobs
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
speak
all
that
was
clear
was
that
there
was
something
very
serious
the
matter
at
home
he
thought
his
mother
must
be
either
dying
or
dead
because
she
did
not
speak
or
move
or
open
her
eyes
and
please
please
will
you
come
home
with
me
and
see
her
while
nora
was
getting
ready
to
go
with
the
boy
owen
made
him
sit
on
a
chair
and
having
removed
the
boot
from
the
foot
that
was
bleeding
washed
the
cut
with
some
warm
water
and
bandaged
it
with
a
piece
of
clean
rag
and
then
they
tried
to
persuade
him
to
stay
there
with
frankie
while
nora
went
to
see
his
mother
but
the
boy
would
not
hear
of
it
so
frankie
went
with
them
instead
owen
could
not
go
because
he
had
to
finish
the
which
was
only
just
commenced
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
left
mary
linden
alone
in
the
house
after
she
returned
from
seeing
the
old
people
away
when
the
children
came
home
from
school
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
they
found
her
sitting
in
one
of
the
chairs
with
her
head
resting
on
her
arms
on
the
table
unconscious
they
were
terrified
because
they
could
not
awaken
her
and
began
to
cry
but
presently
charley
thought
of
frankie
mother
and
telling
his
sister
to
stay
there
while
he
was
gone
he
started
off
at
a
run
for
owen
house
leaving
the
front
door
wide
open
after
him
when
nora
and
the
two
boys
reached
the
house
they
found
there
two
other
women
neighbours
who
had
heard
elsie
crying
and
had
come
to
see
what
was
wrong
mary
had
recovered
from
her
faint
and
was
lying
down
on
the
bed
nora
stayed
with
her
for
some
time
after
the
other
women
went
away
she
lit
the
fire
and
gave
the
children
their
tea
there
was
still
some
coal
and
food
left
of
what
had
been
bought
with
the
three
shillings
obtained
from
the
board
of
guardians
and
afterwards
she
tidied
the
house
mary
said
that
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
she
would
have
to
do
in
the
future
if
she
could
get
a
room
somewhere
for
two
or
three
shillings
a
week
her
allowance
from
the
guardians
would
pay
the
rent
and
she
would
be
able
to
earn
enough
for
herself
and
the
children
to
live
on
this
was
the
substance
of
the
story
that
nora
told
owen
when
she
returned
home
he
had
finished
writing
the
and
as
it
was
now
nearly
dry
he
put
on
his
coat
and
took
it
down
to
the
shop
at
the
yard
on
his
way
back
he
met
easton
who
had
been
hanging
about
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
hunter
and
finding
out
if
there
was
any
chance
of
a
job
as
they
walked
along
together
easton
confided
to
owen
that
he
had
earned
scarcely
anything
since
he
had
been
stood
off
at
rushton
and
what
he
had
earned
had
gone
as
usual
to
pay
the
rent
slyme
had
left
them
some
time
ago
ruth
did
not
seem
able
to
get
on
with
him
she
had
been
in
a
funny
sort
of
temper
altogether
but
since
he
had
gone
she
had
had
a
little
work
at
a
on
the
grand
parade
but
things
had
been
going
from
bad
to
worse
they
had
not
been
able
to
keep
up
the
payments
for
the
furniture
they
had
hired
so
the
things
had
been
seized
and
carted
off
they
had
even
stripped
the
oilcloth
from
the
floor
easton
remarked
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
tacked
the
bloody
stuff
down
in
such
a
manner
that
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
take
it
up
without
destroying
it
he
had
been
to
see
didlum
who
said
he
did
want
to
be
hard
on
them
and
that
he
would
keep
the
things
together
for
three
months
and
if
easton
had
paid
up
arrears
by
that
time
he
could
have
them
back
again
but
there
was
in
easton
opinion
very
little
chance
of
that
owen
listened
with
contempt
and
anger
here
was
a
man
who
grumbled
at
the
present
state
of
things
yet
took
no
trouble
to
think
for
himself
and
try
to
alter
them
and
who
at
the
first
chance
would
vote
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
system
which
produced
his
misery
you
heard
that
old
jack
linden
and
his
wife
went
to
the
workhouse
today
he
said
replied
easton
indifferently
only
what
i
expected
owen
then
suggested
it
would
not
be
a
bad
plan
for
easton
to
let
his
front
room
now
that
it
was
empty
to
mrs
linden
who
would
be
sure
to
pay
her
rent
which
would
help
easton
to
pay
his
easton
agreed
and
said
he
would
mention
it
to
ruth
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
parted
the
next
morning
nora
found
ruth
talking
to
mary
linden
about
the
room
and
as
the
eastons
lived
only
about
five
minutes
walk
away
they
all
three
went
round
there
in
order
that
mary
might
see
the
room
the
appearance
of
the
house
from
outside
was
unaltered
the
white
lace
curtains
still
draped
the
windows
of
the
front
room
and
in
the
centre
of
the
bay
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
round
table
covered
with
a
red
cloth
and
upon
it
a
geranium
in
a
flowerpot
standing
in
a
saucer
with
a
frill
of
coloured
tissue
paper
round
it
these
things
and
the
curtains
which
fell
close
together
made
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
see
that
the
room
was
otherwise
unfurnished
the
consisted
of
an
empty
wooden
box
procured
from
the
grocer
stood
on
end
with
the
lid
of
the
scullery
copper
placed
upside
down
upon
it
for
a
top
and
covered
with
an
old
piece
of
red
cloth
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
prevent
the
neighbours
from
thinking
that
they
were
hard
up
although
they
knew
that
nearly
all
those
same
neighbours
were
in
more
or
less
similar
straits
it
was
not
a
very
large
room
considering
that
it
would
have
to
serve
all
purposes
for
herself
and
the
two
children
but
mrs
linden
knew
that
it
was
not
likely
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
one
as
good
elsewhere
for
the
same
price
so
she
agreed
to
take
it
from
the
following
monday
at
two
shillings
a
week
as
the
distance
was
so
short
they
were
able
to
carry
most
of
the
smaller
things
to
their
new
home
during
the
next
few
days
and
on
the
monday
evening
when
it
was
dark
owen
and
easton
brought
the
remainder
on
a
truck
they
borrowed
for
the
purpose
from
hunter
during
the
last
weeks
of
february
the
severity
of
the
weather
increased
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
on
the
followed
by
a
hard
frost
which
lasted
several
days
about
ten
one
night
a
policeman
found
a
man
lying
unconscious
in
the
middle
of
a
lonely
road
at
first
he
thought
the
man
was
drunk
and
after
dragging
him
on
to
the
footpath
out
of
the
way
of
passing
vehicles
he
went
for
the
stretcher
they
took
the
man
to
the
station
and
put
him
into
a
cell
which
was
already
occupied
by
a
man
who
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
stealing
a
swede
turnip
from
a
barn
when
the
police
surgeon
came
he
pronounced
the
supposed
drunken
man
to
be
dying
from
bronchitis
and
want
of
food
and
he
further
said
that
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
man
was
addicted
to
drink
when
the
inquest
was
held
a
few
days
afterwards
the
coroner
remarked
that
it
was
the
third
case
of
death
from
destitution
that
had
occurred
in
the
town
within
six
weeks
the
evidence
showed
that
the
man
was
a
plasterer
who
had
walked
from
london
with
the
hope
of
finding
work
somewhere
in
the
country
he
had
no
money
in
his
possession
when
he
was
found
by
the
policeman
all
that
his
pockets
contained
being
several
and
a
letter
from
his
wife
which
was
not
found
until
after
he
died
because
it
was
in
an
inner
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
a
few
days
before
this
inquest
was
held
the
man
who
had
been
arrested
for
stealing
the
turnip
had
been
taken
before
the
magistrates
the
poor
wretch
said
he
did
it
because
he
was
starving
but
aldermen
sweater
and
grinder
after
telling
him
that
starvation
was
no
excuse
for
dishonesty
sentenced
him
to
pay
a
fine
of
seven
shillings
and
costs
or
go
to
prison
for
seven
days
with
hard
labour
as
the
convict
had
neither
money
nor
friends
he
had
to
go
to
jail
where
he
was
after
all
better
off
than
most
of
those
who
were
still
outside
because
they
lacked
either
the
courage
or
the
opportunity
to
steal
something
to
relieve
their
sufferings
as
time
went
on
the
privation
began
to
tell
upon
owen
and
his
family
he
had
a
severe
cough
his
eyes
became
deeply
sunken
and
of
remarkable
brilliancy
and
his
thin
face
was
always
either
deathly
pale
or
dyed
with
a
crimson
flush
frankie
also
began
to
show
the
effects
of
being
obliged
to
go
so
often
without
his
porridge
and
milk
he
became
very
pale
and
thin
and
his
long
hair
came
out
in
handfuls
when
his
mother
combed
or
brushed
it
this
was
a
great
trouble
to
the
boy
who
since
hearing
the
story
of
samson
read
out
of
the
bible
at
school
had
ceased
from
asking
to
have
his
hair
cut
short
lest
he
should
lose
his
strength
in
consequence
he
used
to
test
himself
by
going
through
a
certain
exercise
he
had
himself
invented
with
a
flat
iron
and
he
was
always
much
relieved
when
he
found
that
notwithstanding
the
loss
of
the
porridge
he
was
still
able
to
lift
the
iron
the
proper
number
of
times
but
after
a
while
as
he
found
that
it
became
increasingly
difficult
to
go
through
the
exercise
he
gave
it
up
altogether
secretly
resolving
to
wait
until
had
more
work
to
do
so
that
he
could
have
the
porridge
and
milk
again
he
was
sorry
to
have
to
discontinue
the
exercise
but
he
said
nothing
about
it
to
his
father
or
mother
because
he
did
not
want
to
them
sometimes
nora
managed
to
get
a
small
job
of
needlework
on
one
occasion
a
woman
with
a
small
son
brought
a
parcel
of
garments
belonging
to
herself
or
her
husband
an
old
ulster
several
coats
and
so
on
things
that
although
they
were
too
or
shabby
to
wear
yet
might
look
all
right
if
turned
and
made
up
for
the
boy
nora
undertook
to
do
this
and
after
working
several
hours
every
day
for
a
week
she
earned
four
shillings
and
even
then
the
woman
thought
it
was
so
dear
that
she
did
not
bring
any
more
another
time
mrs
easton
got
her
some
work
at
a
where
she
herself
was
employed
the
servant
was
laid
up
and
they
wanted
some
help
for
a
few
days
the
pay
was
to
be
two
shillings
a
day
and
dinner
owen
did
not
want
her
to
go
because
he
feared
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
do
the
work
but
he
gave
way
at
last
and
nora
went
she
had
to
do
the
bedrooms
and
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
as
a
result
of
the
constant
running
up
and
down
the
stairs
carrying
heavy
cans
and
pails
of
water
she
was
in
such
intense
pain
that
she
was
scarcely
able
to
walk
home
and
for
several
days
afterwards
had
to
lie
in
bed
through
a
recurrence
of
her
old
illness
which
caused
her
to
suffer
untold
agony
whenever
she
tried
to
stand
owen
was
alternately
dejected
and
maddened
by
the
knowledge
of
his
own
helplessness
when
he
was
not
doing
anything
for
rushton
he
went
about
the
town
trying
to
find
some
other
work
but
usually
with
scant
success
he
did
some
samples
of
showcard
and
window
tickets
and
endeavoured
to
get
some
orders
by
canvassing
the
shops
in
the
town
but
this
was
also
a
failure
for
these
people
generally
had
a
to
whom
they
usually
gave
their
work
he
did
get
a
few
trifling
orders
but
they
were
scarcely
worth
doing
at
the
price
he
got
for
them
he
used
to
feel
like
a
criminal
when
he
went
into
the
shops
to
ask
them
for
the
work
because
he
realized
fully
that
in
effect
he
was
saying
to
them
your
work
away
from
the
other
man
and
employ
me
he
was
so
conscious
of
this
that
it
gave
him
a
shamefaced
manner
which
coupled
as
it
was
with
his
shabby
clothing
did
not
create
a
very
favourable
impression
upon
those
he
addressed
who
usually
treated
him
with
about
as
much
courtesy
as
they
would
have
extended
to
any
other
sort
of
beggar
generally
after
a
day
canvassing
he
returned
home
unsuccessful
and
faint
with
hunger
and
fatigue
once
when
there
was
a
bitterly
cold
east
wind
blowing
he
was
out
on
one
of
these
canvassing
expeditions
and
contracted
a
severe
cold
his
chest
became
so
bad
that
he
found
it
almost
impossible
to
speak
because
the
effort
to
do
so
often
brought
on
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
it
was
during
this
time
that
a
firm
of
drapers
for
whom
he
had
done
some
showcards
sent
him
an
order
for
one
they
wanted
in
a
hurry
it
had
to
be
delivered
the
next
morning
so
he
stayed
up
by
himself
till
nearly
midnight
to
do
it
as
he
worked
he
felt
a
strange
sensation
in
his
chest
it
was
not
exactly
a
pain
and
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
describe
it
in
words
it
was
just
a
sensation
he
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
it
thinking
it
an
effect
of
the
cold
he
had
taken
but
whatever
it
was
he
could
not
help
feeling
conscious
of
it
all
the
time
frankie
had
been
put
to
bed
that
evening
at
the
customary
hour
but
did
not
seem
to
be
sleeping
as
well
as
usual
owen
could
hear
him
twisting
and
turning
about
and
uttering
little
cries
in
his
sleep
he
left
his
work
several
times
to
go
into
the
boy
room
and
cover
him
with
the
bedclothes
which
his
restless
movements
had
disordered
as
the
time
wore
on
the
child
became
more
tranquil
and
about
eleven
when
owen
went
in
to
look
at
him
he
found
him
in
a
deep
sleep
lying
on
his
side
with
his
head
thrown
back
on
the
pillow
breathing
so
softly
through
his
slightly
parted
lips
that
the
sound
was
almost
imperceptible
the
fair
hair
that
clustered
round
his
forehead
was
damp
with
perspiration
and
he
was
so
still
and
pale
and
silent
that
one
might
have
thought
he
was
sleeping
the
sleep
that
knows
no
awakening
about
an
hour
later
when
he
had
finished
writing
the
showcard
owen
went
out
into
the
scullery
to
wash
his
hands
before
going
to
bed
and
whilst
he
was
drying
them
on
the
towel
the
strange
sensation
he
had
been
conscious
of
all
the
evening
became
more
intense
and
a
few
seconds
afterwards
he
was
terrified
to
find
his
mouth
suddenly
filled
with
blood
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
he
fought
for
breath
against
the
suffocating
torrent
and
when
at
length
it
stopped
he
sank
trembling
into
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
table
holding
the
towel
to
his
mouth
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
whilst
a
cold
sweat
streamed
from
every
pore
and
gathered
in
large
drops
upon
his
forehead
through
the
deathlike
silence
of
the
night
there
came
from
time
to
time
the
chimes
of
the
clock
of
a
distant
church
but
he
continued
to
sit
there
motionless
taking
no
heed
of
the
passing
hours
and
possessed
with
an
awful
terror
so
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
afterwards
the
other
two
would
be
left
by
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
world
in
a
few
time
the
boy
would
be
like
bert
white
in
the
clutches
of
some
devil
like
hunter
or
rushton
who
would
use
him
as
if
he
were
a
beast
of
burden
he
imagined
he
could
see
him
now
as
he
would
be
then
worked
driven
and
bullied
carrying
loads
dragging
carts
and
running
here
and
there
trying
his
best
to
satisfy
the
brutal
tyrants
whose
only
thought
would
be
to
get
profit
out
of
him
for
themselves
if
he
lived
it
would
be
to
grow
up
with
his
body
deformed
and
dwarfed
by
unnatural
labour
and
with
his
mind
stultified
degraded
and
brutalized
by
ignorance
and
poverty
as
this
vision
of
the
future
rose
before
him
owen
resolved
that
it
should
never
be
he
would
not
leave
them
alone
and
defenceless
in
the
midst
of
the
wolves
who
were
waiting
to
rend
them
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
if
he
could
not
give
them
happiness
he
could
at
least
put
them
out
of
the
reach
of
further
suffering
if
he
could
not
stay
with
them
they
would
have
to
come
with
him
it
would
be
kinder
and
more
merciful
chapter
facing
the
nearly
every
other
firm
in
the
town
was
in
much
the
same
plight
as
rushton
none
of
them
had
anything
to
speak
of
to
do
and
the
workmen
no
longer
troubled
to
go
to
the
different
shops
asking
for
a
job
they
knew
it
was
of
no
use
most
of
them
just
walked
about
aimlessly
or
stood
talking
in
groups
in
the
streets
principally
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
wage
slave
market
near
the
fountain
on
the
grand
parade
they
congregated
here
in
such
numbers
that
one
or
two
residents
wrote
to
the
local
papers
complaining
of
the
and
pointing
out
that
it
was
calculated
to
drive
the
visitors
out
of
the
town
after
this
two
or
three
extra
policemen
were
put
on
duty
near
the
fountain
with
instructions
to
on
any
groups
of
unemployed
that
formed
they
could
not
stop
them
from
coming
there
but
they
prevented
them
standing
about
the
processions
of
unemployed
continued
every
day
and
the
money
they
begged
from
the
public
was
divided
equally
amongst
those
who
took
part
sometimes
it
amounted
to
one
and
sixpence
each
sometimes
it
was
a
little
more
and
sometimes
a
little
less
these
men
presented
a
terrible
spectacle
as
they
slunk
through
the
dreary
streets
through
the
rain
or
the
snow
with
the
slush
soaking
into
their
broken
boots
and
worse
still
with
the
bitterly
cold
east
wind
penetrating
their
rotten
clothing
and
freezing
their
famished
bodies
the
majority
of
the
skilled
workers
still
held
aloof
from
these
processions
although
their
haggard
faces
bore
involuntary
testimony
to
their
sufferings
although
privation
reigned
supreme
in
their
desolate
homes
where
there
was
often
neither
food
nor
light
nor
fire
they
were
too
to
parade
their
misery
before
each
other
or
the
world
they
secretly
sold
or
pawned
their
clothing
and
their
furniture
and
lived
in
on
the
proceeds
and
on
credit
but
they
would
not
beg
many
of
them
even
echoed
the
sentiments
of
those
who
had
written
to
the
papers
and
with
a
strange
lack
of
blamed
those
who
took
part
in
the
processions
they
said
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
that
drove
the
class
away
injured
the
town
and
caused
all
the
poverty
and
unemployment
however
some
of
them
accepted
charity
in
other
ways
district
visitors
distributed
tickets
for
coal
and
groceries
not
that
that
sort
of
thing
made
much
difference
there
was
usually
a
great
deal
of
fuss
and
advice
many
quotations
of
scripture
and
very
little
groceries
and
even
what
there
was
generally
went
to
the
people
because
the
only
way
to
obtain
any
of
this
sort
of
is
by
hypocritically
pretending
to
be
religious
and
the
greater
the
hypocrite
the
greater
the
quantity
of
coal
and
groceries
these
people
went
into
the
wretched
homes
of
the
poor
and
in
effect
said
every
particle
of
cringe
and
fawn
come
to
church
bow
down
and
grovel
to
us
and
in
return
we
give
you
a
ticket
that
you
can
take
to
a
certain
shop
and
exchange
for
a
shillingsworth
of
groceries
and
if
you
very
servile
and
humble
we
may
give
you
another
one
next
week
they
never
gave
the
the
money
the
ticket
system
serves
three
purposes
it
prevents
the
abusing
the
by
spending
the
money
on
drink
it
advertises
the
benevolence
of
the
donors
and
it
enables
the
grocer
who
is
usually
a
member
of
the
church
to
get
rid
of
any
stale
or
damaged
stock
he
may
have
on
hand
when
these
visiting
ladies
went
into
a
workman
house
and
found
it
clean
and
decently
furnished
and
the
children
clean
and
tidy
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
those
people
were
not
suitable
for
assistance
perhaps
the
children
had
had
next
to
nothing
to
eat
and
would
have
been
in
rags
if
the
mother
had
not
worked
like
a
slave
washing
and
mending
their
clothes
but
these
were
not
the
sort
of
cases
that
the
visiting
ladies
assisted
they
only
gave
to
those
who
were
in
a
state
of
absolute
squalor
and
destitution
and
then
only
on
condition
that
they
whined
and
grovelled
in
addition
to
this
district
visitor
business
the
inhabitants
and
the
local
authorities
attempted
or
rather
pretended
to
grapple
with
the
poverty
in
many
other
ways
and
the
columns
of
the
local
papers
were
filled
with
letters
from
all
sorts
of
cranks
who
suggested
various
remedies
one
individual
whose
income
was
derived
from
brewery
shares
attributed
the
prevailing
distress
to
the
drunken
and
improvident
habits
of
the
lower
orders
another
suggested
that
it
was
a
divine
protest
against
the
growth
of
ritualism
and
what
he
called
religion
and
suggested
a
day
of
humiliation
and
prayer
a
great
number
of
persons
thought
this
such
an
excellent
proposition
that
they
proceeded
to
put
it
into
practice
they
prayed
whilst
the
unemployed
and
the
little
children
fasted
if
one
had
not
been
oppressed
by
the
tragedy
of
want
and
misery
one
might
have
laughed
at
the
farcical
imbecile
measures
that
were
taken
to
relieve
it
several
churches
held
what
they
called
or
sales
they
sent
out
circulars
something
like
this
jumble
sale
in
aid
of
the
unemployed
if
you
have
any
articles
of
any
description
which
are
of
no
further
use
to
you
we
should
be
grateful
for
them
and
if
you
will
kindly
fill
in
annexed
form
and
post
it
to
us
we
will
send
and
collect
them
on
the
day
of
the
sale
the
parish
room
was
transformed
into
a
kind
of
marine
stores
filled
with
all
manner
of
rubbish
with
the
parson
and
the
visiting
ladies
grinning
in
the
midst
the
things
were
sold
for
next
to
nothing
to
such
as
cared
to
buy
them
and
the
local
man
reaped
a
fine
harvest
the
proceeds
of
these
sales
were
distributed
in
and
it
was
usually
a
case
of
much
cry
and
little
wool
there
was
a
religious
organization
called
mugsborough
skull
and
crossbones
boys
which
existed
for
the
purpose
of
perpetuating
the
great
religious
festival
of
guy
fawkes
this
association
also
came
to
the
aid
of
the
unemployed
and
organized
a
grand
fancy
dress
carnival
and
torchlight
procession
when
this
took
place
although
there
was
a
slight
sprinkling
of
individuals
dressed
in
tawdry
costumes
as
cavaliers
of
the
time
of
charles
i
and
a
few
more
as
highwaymen
or
footpads
the
majority
of
the
processionists
were
boys
in
clothes
or
wearing
sacks
with
holes
cut
in
them
for
their
heads
and
arms
and
with
their
faces
smeared
with
soot
there
were
also
a
number
of
men
carrying
in
which
they
burnt
red
and
blue
fire
the
procession
or
rather
mob
was
headed
by
a
band
and
the
band
was
headed
by
two
men
arm
in
arm
one
very
tall
dressed
to
represent
satan
in
red
tights
with
horns
on
his
head
and
smoking
a
large
cigar
and
the
other
attired
in
the
no
less
picturesque
costume
of
a
bishop
of
the
established
church
this
crew
paraded
the
town
howling
and
dancing
carrying
flaring
torches
burning
the
blue
and
red
fire
and
some
of
them
singing
silly
or
obscene
songs
whilst
the
collectors
ran
about
with
the
boxes
begging
for
money
from
people
who
were
in
most
cases
nearly
as
as
the
unemployed
they
were
asked
to
assist
the
money
thus
obtained
was
afterwards
handed
over
to
the
secretary
of
the
organized
benevolence
society
mr
sawney
grinder
then
there
was
the
soup
kitchen
which
was
really
an
inferior
in
a
mean
street
the
man
who
ran
this
was
a
relative
of
the
secretary
of
the
obs
he
cadged
all
the
ingredients
for
the
soup
from
different
tradespeople
bones
and
scraps
of
meat
from
butchers
pea
meal
and
split
peas
from
provision
dealers
vegetables
from
greengrocers
stale
bread
from
bakers
and
so
on
charitable
old
women
with
more
money
than
sense
sent
him
donations
in
cash
and
he
sold
the
soup
for
a
penny
a
basin
or
a
penny
a
quart
to
those
who
brought
jugs
he
had
a
large
number
of
shilling
books
printed
each
containing
thirteen
penny
tickets
the
organized
benevolence
society
bought
a
lot
of
these
books
and
resold
them
to
benevolent
persons
or
gave
them
away
to
cases
it
was
this
connection
with
the
obs
that
gave
the
soup
kitchen
a
character
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
and
furnished
the
proprietor
with
the
excuse
for
cadging
the
materials
and
money
donations
in
the
case
of
the
soup
kitchen
as
with
the
unemployed
processions
most
of
those
who
benefited
were
unskilled
labourers
or
derelicts
with
but
few
exceptions
the
unemployed
artisans
although
their
need
was
just
as
great
as
that
of
the
others
avoided
the
place
as
if
it
were
infected
with
the
plague
they
were
afraid
even
to
pass
through
the
street
where
it
was
situated
lest
anyone
seeing
them
coming
from
that
direction
should
think
they
had
been
there
but
all
the
same
some
of
them
allowed
their
children
to
go
there
by
stealth
by
night
to
buy
some
of
this
food
another
brilliant
scheme
practical
and
statesmanlike
so
different
from
the
wild
projects
of
demented
socialists
was
started
by
the
rev
mr
bosher
a
popular
preacher
the
vicar
of
the
fashionable
church
of
the
whited
sepulchre
he
collected
some
subscriptions
from
a
number
of
old
women
who
attended
his
church
with
some
of
this
money
he
bought
a
quantity
of
timber
and
opened
what
he
called
a
labour
yard
where
he
employed
a
number
of
men
sawing
firewood
being
a
clergyman
and
because
he
said
he
wanted
it
for
a
charitable
purpose
of
course
he
obtained
the
timber
very
cheaply
for
about
half
what
anyone
else
would
have
had
to
pay
for
it
the
was
done
piecework
a
log
of
wood
about
the
size
of
a
railway
sleeper
had
to
be
sawn
into
twelve
pieces
and
each
of
these
had
to
be
chopped
into
four
for
sawing
and
chopping
one
log
in
this
manner
the
worker
was
paid
ninepence
one
log
made
two
bags
of
firewood
which
were
sold
for
a
shilling
each
a
trifle
under
the
usual
price
the
men
who
delivered
the
bags
were
paid
three
for
each
two
bags
as
there
were
such
a
lot
of
men
wanting
to
do
this
work
no
one
was
allowed
to
do
more
than
three
lots
in
one
day
that
came
to
two
shillings
and
threepence
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
do
more
than
two
days
in
one
week
the
vicar
had
a
number
of
bills
printed
and
displayed
in
shop
windows
calling
attention
to
what
he
was
doing
and
informing
the
public
that
orders
could
be
sent
to
the
vicarage
by
post
and
would
receive
prompt
attention
and
the
fuel
could
be
delivered
at
any
address
messrs
rushton
having
very
kindly
lent
a
handcart
for
the
use
of
the
men
employed
at
the
labour
yard
as
a
result
of
the
appearance
of
this
bill
and
of
the
laudatory
notices
in
the
columns
of
the
ananias
the
obscurer
and
the
chloroform
the
papers
did
not
mind
giving
the
business
a
free
advertisement
because
it
was
a
charitable
concern
many
persons
withdrew
their
custom
from
those
who
usually
supplied
them
with
firewood
and
gave
their
orders
to
the
yard
and
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
getting
their
fuel
cheaper
than
before
and
of
performing
a
charitable
action
at
the
same
time
as
a
remedy
for
unemployment
this
scheme
was
on
a
par
with
the
method
of
the
tailor
in
the
fable
who
thought
to
lengthen
his
cloth
by
cutting
a
piece
off
one
end
and
sewing
it
on
to
the
other
but
there
was
one
thing
about
it
that
recommended
it
to
the
vicar
it
was
he
found
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
use
all
the
money
he
had
extracted
from
the
old
ladies
for
timber
so
he
bought
himself
a
newfoundland
dog
an
antique
set
of
carved
ivory
chessmen
and
a
dozen
bottles
of
whisky
with
the
remainder
of
the
cash
the
reverend
gentleman
hit
upon
yet
another
means
of
helping
the
poor
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
weekly
chloroform
appealing
for
boots
for
poor
children
this
was
considered
such
a
splendid
idea
that
the
editors
of
all
the
local
papers
referred
to
it
in
leading
articles
and
several
other
letters
were
written
by
prominent
citizens
extolling
the
wisdom
and
benevolence
of
the
profound
bosher
most
of
the
boots
that
were
sent
in
response
to
this
appeal
had
been
worn
until
they
needed
repair
in
a
very
large
proportion
of
instances
until
they
were
beyond
repair
the
poor
people
to
whom
they
were
given
could
not
afford
to
have
them
mended
before
using
them
and
the
result
was
that
the
boots
generally
began
to
fall
to
pieces
after
a
few
days
wear
this
scheme
amounted
to
very
little
it
did
not
increase
the
number
of
boots
and
most
of
the
people
who
off
their
boots
generally
gave
them
to
someone
or
other
the
only
difference
it
can
have
made
was
that
possibly
a
few
persons
who
usually
threw
their
boots
away
or
sold
them
to
dealers
may
have
been
induced
to
send
them
to
mr
bosher
instead
but
all
the
same
nearly
everybody
said
it
was
a
splendid
idea
its
originator
was
applauded
as
a
public
benefactor
and
the
pettifogging
busybodies
who
amused
themselves
with
what
they
were
pleased
to
term
work
went
into
imbecile
ecstasies
over
him
chapter
the
obs
one
of
the
most
important
agencies
for
the
relief
of
distress
was
the
organized
benevolence
society
this
association
received
money
from
many
sources
the
proceeds
of
the
carnival
the
collections
from
different
churches
and
chapels
which
held
special
services
in
aid
of
the
unemployed
the
weekly
collections
made
by
the
employees
of
several
local
firms
and
business
houses
the
proceeds
of
concerts
bazaars
and
entertainments
donations
from
charitable
persons
and
the
subscriptions
of
the
members
the
society
also
received
large
quantities
of
clothing
and
boots
and
tickets
of
admission
to
hospitals
convalescent
homes
and
dispensaries
from
subscribers
to
those
institutions
or
from
people
like
rushton
who
had
in
their
workshops
and
offices
altogether
during
the
last
year
the
society
had
received
from
various
sources
about
three
hundred
pounds
in
hard
cash
this
money
was
devoted
to
the
relief
of
cases
of
distress
the
largest
item
in
the
expenditure
of
the
society
was
the
salary
of
the
general
secretary
mr
sawney
grinder
a
most
deserving
case
who
was
paid
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
after
the
death
of
the
previous
secretary
there
were
so
many
candidates
for
the
vacant
post
that
the
election
of
the
new
secretary
was
a
rather
exciting
affair
the
excitement
was
all
the
more
intense
because
it
was
restrained
a
special
meeting
of
the
society
was
held
the
mayor
alderman
sweater
presided
and
amongst
those
present
were
councillors
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
mrs
starvem
rev
mr
bosher
a
number
of
the
rich
old
women
who
had
helped
to
open
the
labour
yard
and
several
other
some
of
these
were
the
district
visitors
already
alluded
to
most
of
them
the
wives
of
wealthy
citizens
and
retired
tradesmen
richly
dressed
ignorant
insolent
overbearing
frumps
who
after
filling
themselves
with
good
things
in
their
own
luxurious
homes
went
flouncing
into
the
dwellings
of
their
poor
and
talked
to
them
of
lectured
them
about
sobriety
and
thrift
and
sometimes
gave
them
tickets
for
soup
or
orders
for
shillingsworths
of
groceries
or
coal
some
of
these
overfed
females
the
wives
of
tradesmen
for
instance
belonged
to
the
organized
benevolence
society
and
engaged
in
this
for
the
purpose
of
becoming
acquainted
with
people
of
superior
social
position
one
of
the
members
was
a
colonel
and
sir
graball
the
member
of
parliament
for
the
borough
also
belonged
to
the
society
and
occasionally
attended
its
meetings
others
took
up
district
visiting
as
a
hobby
they
had
nothing
to
do
and
being
densely
ignorant
and
of
inferior
mentality
they
had
no
desire
or
capacity
for
any
intellectual
pursuit
so
they
took
up
this
work
for
the
pleasure
of
playing
the
grand
lady
and
the
superior
person
at
a
very
small
expense
other
of
these
visiting
ladies
were
unmarried
women
with
small
private
incomes
some
of
them
compassionate
gentle
creatures
who
did
this
work
because
they
sincerely
desired
to
help
others
and
they
knew
of
no
better
way
these
did
not
take
much
part
in
the
business
of
the
meetings
they
paid
their
subscriptions
and
helped
to
distribute
the
clothing
and
boots
to
those
who
needed
them
and
occasionally
obtained
from
the
secretary
an
order
for
provisions
or
coal
or
bread
for
some
family
but
the
poor
women
whom
they
visited
welcomed
them
more
for
their
sisterly
sympathy
than
for
the
gifts
they
brought
some
of
the
visiting
ladies
were
of
this
character
but
they
were
not
many
they
were
as
a
few
fragrant
flowers
amidst
a
dense
accumulation
of
noxious
weeds
they
were
examples
of
humility
and
kindness
shining
amidst
a
vile
and
loathsome
mass
of
hypocrisy
arrogance
and
cant
when
the
chairman
had
opened
the
meeting
mr
rushton
moved
a
vote
of
condolence
with
the
relatives
of
the
late
secretary
whom
he
eulogized
in
the
most
extraordinary
terms
poor
of
mugsborough
had
lost
a
kind
and
sympathetic
friend
who
had
devoted
his
life
to
helping
the
needy
and
so
on
and
so
forth
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
time
of
the
defunct
had
been
passed
in
helping
himself
but
rushton
said
nothing
about
that
mr
didlum
seconded
the
vote
of
condolence
in
similar
terms
and
it
was
carried
unanimously
then
the
chairman
said
that
the
next
business
was
to
elect
a
successor
to
the
departed
paragon
and
immediately
no
fewer
than
nine
members
rose
to
propose
a
suitable
person
they
each
had
a
friend
or
relative
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
good
of
the
poor
the
nine
benevolent
stood
looking
at
each
other
and
at
the
chairman
with
sickly
smiles
upon
their
hypocritical
faces
it
was
a
dramatic
moment
no
one
spoke
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
it
would
never
do
to
have
a
contest
the
secretary
of
the
obs
was
usually
regarded
as
a
sort
of
philanthropist
by
the
outside
public
and
it
was
necessary
to
keep
this
fiction
alive
for
one
or
two
minutes
an
awkward
silence
reigned
then
one
after
another
they
all
reluctantly
resumed
their
seats
with
the
exception
of
mr
amos
grinder
who
said
he
wished
to
propose
his
nephew
mr
sawney
grinder
a
young
man
of
a
most
benevolent
disposition
who
was
desirous
of
immolating
himself
upon
the
altar
of
charity
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
or
words
to
that
effect
mr
didlum
seconded
and
there
being
no
other
nomination
for
they
all
knew
that
it
would
give
the
game
away
to
have
a
contest
the
chairman
put
mr
grinder
proposal
to
the
meeting
and
declared
it
carried
unanimously
another
considerable
item
in
the
expenditure
of
the
society
was
the
rent
of
the
offices
a
house
in
a
back
street
the
landlord
of
this
place
was
another
very
deserving
case
there
were
numerous
other
expenses
stationery
and
stamps
printing
and
so
on
and
what
was
left
of
the
money
was
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
given
a
reasonable
amount
being
kept
in
hand
for
future
expenses
all
the
details
were
of
course
duly
set
forth
in
the
report
and
balance
sheet
at
the
annual
meetings
no
copy
of
this
document
was
ever
handed
to
the
reporters
for
publication
it
was
read
to
the
meeting
by
the
secretary
the
representatives
of
the
press
took
notes
and
in
the
reports
of
the
meeting
that
subsequently
appeared
in
the
local
papers
the
thing
was
so
mixed
up
and
garbled
together
that
the
few
people
who
read
it
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
the
only
thing
that
was
clear
was
that
the
society
had
been
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
to
someone
or
other
and
that
more
money
was
urgently
needed
to
carry
on
the
work
it
usually
appeared
something
like
this
helping
the
needy
mugsborough
organized
benevolence
society
annual
meeting
at
the
town
hall
a
splendid
record
of
miscellaneous
and
valuable
work
the
annual
meeting
of
the
above
society
was
held
yesterday
at
the
town
hall
the
mayor
alderman

presided
and
amongst
those

were

and
here
followed
about
a
quarter
of
a
column
of
names
of
other
charitable
persons
all
subscribers
to
the
society
the
secretary
read
the
annual
report
which
contained
the
following
amongst
other
interesting
items
during
the
year
applications
for
assistance
have
been
received
and
of
this
number
have
been

great

and
so
on
there
was
about
another
quarter
of
a
column
of
these
details
the
reading
of
which
was
punctuated
with
applause
and
concluded
with
cases
which
for
various
reasons
the
society
was
unable
to
assist
the
report
then
went
on
to
explain
that
the
work
of
inquiring
into
the
genuineness
of
the
applications
entailed
a
lot
of
labour
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
some
cases
taking
several
days
no
fewer
than
letters
had
been
sent
out
from
the
office
and
postcards
applause
very
few
cash
gifts
were
granted
as
it
was
most
necessary
to
guard
against
the
charity
being
abused
hear
hear
then
followed
a
most
remarkable
paragraph
headed
balance
sheet
which
as
it
was
put
the
following
following
was
a
jumbled
list
of
items
of
expenditure
subscriptions
donations
legacies
and
collections
winding
up
with
general
summary
showed
a
balance
in
hand
of
they
always
kept
a
good
balance
in
hand
because
of
the
secretary
salary
and
the
rent
of
the
offices
after
this
very
explicit
financial
statement
came
the
most
important
part
of
the
report
are
expressed
to
sir
graball
for
a
donation

to

and
an
urgent
appeal
to
the
charitable
public
for
more
funds
to
enable
the
society
to
continue
its
noble
work
meantime
in
spite
of
this
and
kindred
organizations
the
conditions
of
the
poverty
stricken
and
unemployed
workers
remained
the
same
although
the
people
who
got
the
grocery
and
coal
orders
the
and
the
clothes
and
boots
were
very
glad
to
have
them
yet
these
things
did
far
more
harm
than
good
they
humiliated
degraded
and
pauperized
those
who
received
them
and
the
existence
of
the
societies
prevented
the
problem
being
grappled
with
in
a
sane
and
practical
manner
the
people
lacked
the
necessaries
of
life
the
necessaries
of
life
are
produced
by
work
these
people
were
willing
to
work
but
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
idiotic
system
of
society
which
these
people
are
determined
to
do
their
best
to
perpetuate
if
the
people
who
expect
to
be
praised
and
glorified
for
being
charitable
were
never
to
give
another
farthing
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
industrious
poor
because
then
the
community
as
a
whole
would
be
compelled
to
deal
with
the
absurd
and
unnecessary
state
of
affairs
that
exists
today
millions
of
people
living
and
dying
in
wretchedness
and
poverty
in
an
age
when
science
and
machinery
have
made
it
possible
to
produce
such
an
abundance
of
everything
that
everyone
might
enjoy
plenty
and
comfort
it
if
were
not
for
all
this
charity
the
starving
unemployed
men
all
over
the
country
would
demand
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
produce
the
things
they
are
perishing
for
want
of
instead
of
being
as
they
are
now
content
to
wear
their
masters
clothing
and
to
eat
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
his
table
chapter
a
brilliant
epigram
all
through
the
winter
the
wise
practical
philanthropic
fat
persons
whom
the
people
of
mugsborough
had
elected
to
manage
their
affairs
or
whom
they
permitted
to
manage
them
without
being
elected
continued
to
grapple
or
to
pretend
to
grapple
with
the
of
unemployment
and
poverty
they
continued
to
hold
meetings
rummage
and
jumble
sales
entertainments
and
special
services
they
continued
to
distribute
the
rotten
clothing
and
boots
and
the
nourishment
tickets
they
were
all
so
sorry
for
the
poor
especially
for
the
little
children
they
did
all
sorts
of
things
to
help
the
children
in
fact
there
was
nothing
that
they
would
not
do
for
them
except
levy
a
halfpenny
rate
it
would
never
do
to
do
that
it
might
pauperize
the
parents
and
destroy
parental
responsibility
they
evidently
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
destroy
the
health
or
even
the
lives
of
the
little
children
than
to
pauperize
the
parents
or
undermine
parental
responsibility
these
people
seemed
to
think
that
the
children
were
the
property
of
their
parents
they
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
the
children
are
not
the
property
of
their
parents
at
all
but
the
property
of
the
community
when
they
attain
to
manhood
and
womanhood
they
will
be
if
mentally
or
physically
inefficient
a
burden
on
the
community
if
they
become
criminals
they
will
prey
upon
the
community
and
if
they
are
healthy
educated
and
brought
up
in
good
surroundings
they
will
become
useful
citizens
able
to
render
valuable
service
not
merely
to
their
parents
but
to
the
community
therefore
the
children
are
the
property
of
the
community
and
it
is
the
business
and
to
the
interest
of
the
community
to
see
that
their
constitutions
are
not
undermined
by
starvation
the
secretary
of
the
local
trades
council
a
body
formed
of
delegates
from
all
the
different
trades
unions
in
the
town
wrote
a
letter
to
the
obscurer
setting
forth
this
view
he
pointed
out
that
a
halfpenny
rate
in
that
town
would
produce
a
sum
of
which
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
food
for
all
the
hungry
schoolchildren
in
the
next
issue
of
the
paper
several
other
letters
appeared
from
leading
citizens
including
of
course
sweater
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
ridiculing
the
proposal
of
the
trades
council
who
were
insultingly
alluded
to
as
politicians
agitators
and
so
forth
their
right
to
be
regarded
as
representatives
of
the
working
men
was
denied
and
grinder
who
having
made
inquiries
amongst
working
men
was
acquainted
with
the
facts
stated
that
there
was
scarcely
one
of
the
local
branches
of
the
trades
unions
which
had
more
than
a
dozen
members
and
as
grinder
statement
was
true
the
secretary
was
unable
to
contradict
it
the
majority
of
the
working
men
were
also
very
indignant
when
they
heard
about
the
secretary
letter
they
said
the
rates
were
quite
high
enough
as
it
was
and
they
sneered
at
him
for
presuming
to
write
to
the
papers
at
all
the
bloody
was
they
said
was
not
a
gentleman
was
only
a
workin
man
the
same
as
themselves
a
common
carpenter
what
the
did
know
about
it
nothing
was
just
trying
to
make
out
to
be
somebody
that
was
all
the
idea
of
one
of
the
likes
of
them
writing
to
the
papers
one
day
having
nothing
better
to
do
owen
was
looking
at
some
books
that
were
exposed
for
sale
on
a
table
outside
a
furniture
shop
one
book
in
particular
took
his
attention
he
read
several
pages
with
great
interest
and
regretted
that
he
had
not
the
necessary
sixpence
to
buy
it
the
title
of
the
book
was
consumption
its
causes
and
its
cure
the
author
was
a
physician
who
devoted
his
whole
attention
to
the
study
of
that
disease
amongst
other
things
the
book
gave
rules
for
the
feeding
of
delicate
children
and
there
were
also
several
different
dietaries
recommended
for
adult
persons
suffering
from
the
disease
one
of
these
dietaries
amused
him
very
much
because
as
far
as
the
majority
of
those
who
suffer
from
consumption
are
concerned
the
good
doctor
might
just
as
well
have
prescribed
a
trip
to
the
moon
on
waking
in
the
morning

whilst
owen
was
reading
this
book
crass
harlow
philpot
and
easton
were
talking
together
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
presently
crass
caught
sight
of
him
they
had
been
discussing
the
letter
re
the
halfpenny
rate
and
as
owen
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
trades
council
crass
suggested
that
they
should
go
across
and
tackle
him
about
it
much
is
your
house
assessed
at
asked
owen
after
listening
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
crass
objection
pound
replied
crass
means
that
you
would
have
to
pay
sevenpence
per
year
if
we
had
a
halfpenny
rate
would
it
be
worth
sevenpence
a
year
to
you
to
know
that
there
were
no
starving
children
in
the
town
should
i
to
to
keep
the
children
of
a
man
who
too
lazy
to
work
or
spends
all
money
on
drink
shouted
crass
are
yer
goin
to
make
out
about
the
likes
o
them
his
children
are
starving
we
should
feed
them
first
and
punish
him
afterwards
rates
is
quite
high
enough
as
it
is
grumbled
harlow
who
had
four
children
himself
quite
true
but
you
must
remember
that
the
rates
the
working
classes
at
present
pay
are
spent
mostly
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
good
roads
are
maintained
for
people
who
ride
in
motor
cars
and
carriages
the
park
and
the
town
band
for
those
who
have
leisure
to
enjoy
them
the
police
force
to
protect
the
property
of
those
who
have
something
to
lose
and
so
on
but
if
we
pay
this
rate
we
shall
get
something
for
our
money
gets
the
benefit
of
the
good
roads
when
we
to
push
a
with
a
load
o
paint
and
ladders
said
easton
course
said
crass
besides
the
workin
class
gets
the
benefit
of
all
the
other
things
too
because
it
all
makes
work
for
my
part
said
philpot
would
mind
payin
my
share
towards
a
rate
although
i
ai
got
no
kids
o
me
own
the
hostility
of
most
of
the
working
men
to
the
proposed
rate
was
almost
as
bitter
as
that
of
the
classes
the
philanthropists
who
were
always
gushing
out
their
sympathy
for
the
little
ones
the
loathsome
hypocrites
who
pretended
that
there
was
no
need
to
levy
a
rate
because
they
were
willing
to
give
sufficient
money
in
the
form
of
charity
to
meet
the
case
but
the
children
continued
to
go
hungry
all
the
same
hypocrites
may
seem
a
hard
saying
but
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
the
majority
of
the
children
attending
the
local
elementary
schools
were
insufficiently
fed
it
was
admitted
that
the
money
that
could
be
raised
by
a
halfpenny
rate
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
them
all
with
one
good
meal
every
day
the
who
professed
such
extravagant
sympathy
with
the
little
children
resisted
the
levying
of
the
rate
it
would
press
so
heavily
on
the
poorer
ratepayers
and
said
that
they
were
willing
to
give
more
in
voluntary
charity
than
the
rate
would
amount
to
but
the
little
children
as
they
were
so
fond
of
calling
them
continued
to
go
to
school
hungry
all
the
same
to
judge
them
by
their
profession
and
their
performances
it
appeared
that
these
good
kind
persons
were
willing
to
do
any
mortal
thing
for
the
little
children
except
allow
them
to
be
fed
if
these
people
had
really
meant
to
do
what
they
pretended
they
would
not
have
cared
whether
they
paid
the
money
to
a
or
to
the
secretary
of
a
charity
society
and
they
would
have
preferred
to
accomplish
their
object
in
the
most
efficient
and
economical
way
but
although
they
would
not
allow
the
children
to
be
fed
they
went
to
church
and
to
chapel
glittering
with
jewellery
their
fat
carcases
clothed
in
rich
raiment
and
sat
with
smug
smiles
upon
their
faces
listening
to
the
fat
parsons
reading
out
of
a
book
that
none
of
them
seemed
able
to
understand
for
this
was
what
they
read
jesus
called
a
little
child
unto
him
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
whosoever
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me
but
whoso
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
for
i
say
unto
you
that
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
father
and
this
shall
he
say
unto
them
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
into
the
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
for
i
was
an
hungered
and
ye
gave
me
no
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
ye
gave
me
no
drink
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
not
in
naked
and
ye
clothed
me
not
shall
they
answer
lord
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungered
or
athirst
or
a
stranger
or
naked
or
sick
and
did
not
minister
unto
thee
and
he
shall
answer
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
did
it
not
to
me
these
were
the
sayings
that
the
infidel
parsons
mouthed
in
the
infidel
temples
to
the
richly
dressed
infidel
congregations
who
heard
but
did
not
understand
for
their
hearts
were
become
gross
and
their
ears
dull
of
hearing
and
meantime
all
around
them
in
the
alley
and
the
slum
and
more
terrible
still
because
more
secret
in
the
better
sort
of
streets
where
lived
the
respectable
class
of
skilled
artisans
the
little
children
became
thinner
and
paler
day
by
day
for
lack
of
proper
food
and
went
to
bed
early
because
there
was
no
fire
sir
graball
the
member
of
parliament
for
the
borough
was
one
of
the
bitterest
opponents
of
the
halfpenny
rate
but
as
he
thought
it
was
probable
that
there
would
soon
be
another
general
election
and
he
wanted
the
children
fathers
to
vote
for
him
again
he
was
willing
to
do
something
for
them
in
another
way
he
had
a
daughter
whose
birthday
was
in
that
month
so
the
baronet
made
arrangements
to
give
a
tea
to
all
the
school
children
in
the
town
in
honour
of
the
occasion
the
tea
was
served
in
the
schoolrooms
and
each
child
was
presented
with
a
card
on
which
was
a
printed
portrait
of
the
little
hostess
with
your
loving
little
friend
honoria
in
gold
letters
during
the
evening
the
little
girl
accompanied
by
sir
graball
and
lady
motored
round
to
all
the
schools
where
the
tea
was
being
consumed
the
baronet
made
a
few
remarks
and
honoria
made
a
pretty
little
speech
specially
learnt
for
the
occasion
at
each
place
and
they
were
loudly
cheered
and
greatly
admired
in
response
the
enthusiasm
was
not
confined
to
the
boys
and
girls
for
while
the
speechmaking
was
going
on
inside
a
little
crowd
of
children
were
gathered
round
outside
the
entrance
worshipping
the
motor
car
and
when
the
little
party
came
out
the
crowd
worshipped
them
also
going
into
imbecile
ecstasies
of
admiration
of
their
benevolence
and
their
beautiful
clothes
for
several
weeks
everybody
in
the
town
was
in
raptures
over
this
tea
or
rather
everybody
except
a
miserable
little
minority
of
socialists
who
said
it
was
bribery
an
electioneering
dodge
that
did
no
real
good
and
who
continued
to
clamour
for
a
halfpenny
rate
another
specious
fraud
was
the
committee
this
body
or
corpse
for
there
was
not
much
vitality
in
it
was
supposed
to
exist
for
the
purpose
of
providing
employment
for
cases
one
might
be
excused
for
thinking
that
any
man
no
matter
what
his
past
may
have
been
who
is
willing
to
work
for
his
living
is
a
case
but
this
was
evidently
not
the
opinion
of
the
persons
who
devised
the
regulations
for
the
working
of
this
committee
every
applicant
for
work
was
immediately
given
a
long
job
and
presented
with
a
double
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
to
do
it
with
now
if
the
object
of
the
committee
had
been
to
furnish
the
applicant
with
material
for
the
manufacture
of
an
appropriate
headdress
for
himself
no
one
could
reasonably
have
found
fault
with
them
but
the
foolscap
was
not
to
be
utilized
in
that
way
it
was
called
a
paper
three
pages
of
it
were
covered
with
insulting
inquisitive
irrelevant
questions
concerning
the
private
affairs
and
past
life
of
the
who
wished
to
be
permitted
to
work
for
his
living
and
all
these
had
to
be
answered
to
the
satisfaction
of
messrs
bosher
sweater
rushton
didlum
grinder
and
the
other
members
of
the
committee
before
the
case
stood
any
chance
of
getting
employment
however
notwithstanding
the
offensive
nature
of
the
questions
on
the
application
form
during
the
five
months
that
this
precious
committee
was
in
session
no
fewer
than
and
humble
whelps
filled
up
the
forms
and
answered
the
questions
as
meekly
as
if
they
had
been
sheep
the
funds
of
the
committee
consisted
of
obtained
from
the
imperial
exchequer
and
about
in
charitable
donations
this
money
was
used
to
pay
wages
for
certain
work
some
of
which
would
have
had
to
be
done
even
if
the
committee
had
never
existed
and
if
each
of
the
applicants
had
had
an
equal
share
of
the
work
the
wages
they
would
have
received
would
have
amounted
to
about
twelve
shillings
each
this
was
what
the
persons
the
called
with
the
problem
of
unemployment
imagine
having
to
keep
your
family
for
five
months
with
twelve
shillings
and
if
you
like
imagine
that
the
government
grant
had
been
four
times
as
much
as
it
was
and
that
the
charity
had
amounted
to
four
times
as
much
as
it
did
and
then
fancy
having
to
keep
your
family
for
five
months
with
two
pounds
eight
shillings
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
committee
would
have
been
very
glad
if
they
had
been
able
to
put
the
means
of
earning
a
living
within
the
reach
of
every
man
who
was
willing
to
work
but
they
simply
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
how
to
do
it
they
were
not
ignorant
of
the
reality
of
the
evil
they
were
supposed
to
be
with
appalling
evidences
of
it
faced
them
on
every
side
and
as
after
all
these
committee
men
were
human
beings
and
not
devils
they
would
have
been
glad
to
mitigate
it
if
they
could
have
done
so
without
hurting
themselves
but
the
truth
was
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
these
are
the
men
the
monopolists
of
intelligence
the
wise
individuals
who
control
the
affairs
of
the
world
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
of
such
men
as
these
that
the
conditions
of
human
life
are
regulated
this
is
the
position
it
is
admitted
that
never
before
in
the
history
of
mankind
was
it
possible
to
produce
the
necessaries
of
life
in
such
abundance
as
at
present
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
the
business
of
arranging
the
conditions
under
which
we
live
is
at
present
in
the
hands
of
practical
sensible
the
result
of
their
management
is
that
the
majority
of
the
people
find
it
a
hard
struggle
to
live
large
numbers
exist
in
perpetual
poverty
a
great
many
more
periodically
starve
many
actually
die
of
want
hundreds
destroy
themselves
rather
than
continue
to
live
and
suffer
when
the
practical
sensible
are
asked
why
they
do
not
remedy
this
state
of
things
they
reply
that
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
or
that
it
is
impossible
to
remedy
it
and
yet
it
is
admitted
that
it
is
now
possible
to
produce
the
necessaries
of
life
in
greater
abundance
than
ever
before
with
lavish
kindness
the
supreme
being
had
provided
all
things
necessary
for
the
existence
and
happiness
of
his
creatures
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
so
is
a
blasphemous
lie
it
is
to
suggest
that
the
supreme
being
is
not
good
or
even
just
on
every
side
there
is
an
overflowing
superfluity
of
the
materials
requisite
for
the
production
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
from
these
materials
everything
we
need
may
be
produced
in
abundance
by
work
here
was
an
army
of
people
lacking
the
things
that
may
be
made
by
work
standing
idle
willing
to
work
clamouring
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
the
practical
sensible
did
not
know
what
to
do
of
course
the
real
reason
for
the
difficulty
is
that
the
raw
materials
that
were
created
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
all
have
been
stolen
by
a
small
number
who
refuse
to
allow
them
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
intended
this
numerically
insignificant
minority
refused
to
allow
the
majority
to
work
and
produce
the
things
they
need
and
what
work
they
do
graciously
permit
to
be
done
is
not
done
with
the
object
of
producing
the
necessaries
of
life
for
those
who
work
but
for
the
purpose
of
creating
profit
for
their
masters
and
then
strangest
fact
of
all
the
people
who
find
it
a
hard
struggle
to
live
or
who
exist
in
dreadful
poverty
and
sometimes
starve
instead
of
trying
to
understand
the
causes
of
their
misery
and
to
find
out
a
remedy
themselves
spend
all
their
time
applauding
the
practical
sensible
who
bungle
and
mismanage
their
affairs
and
pay
them
huge
salaries
for
doing
so
sir
graball
for
instance
was
a
of
state
and
was
paid
a
year
when
he
first
got
the
job
the
wages
were
only
a
beggarly
but
as
he
found
it
impossible
to
exist
on
less
than
a
week
he
decided
to
raise
his
salary
to
that
amount
and
the
foolish
people
who
find
it
a
hard
struggle
to
live
paid
it
willingly
and
when
they
saw
the
beautiful
motor
car
and
the
lovely
clothes
and
jewellery
he
purchased
for
his
wife
with
the
money
and
heard
the
great
speech
he
made
telling
them
how
the
shortage
of
everything
was
caused
by
and
foreign
competition
they
clapped
their
hands
and
went
frantic
with
admiration
their
only
regret
was
that
there
were
no
horses
attached
to
the
motor
car
because
if
there
had
been
they
could
have
taken
them
out
and
harnessed
themselves
to
it
instead
nothing
delighted
the
childish
minds
of
these
poor
people
so
much
as
listening
to
or
reading
extracts
from
the
speeches
of
such
men
as
these
so
in
order
to
amuse
them
every
now
and
then
in
the
midst
of
all
the
wretchedness
some
of
the
great
statesmen
made
full
of
cunning
phrases
intended
to
hoodwink
the
fools
who
had
elected
them
the
very
same
week
that
sir
graball
salary
was
increased
to
a
year
all
the
papers
were
full
of
a
very
fine
one
that
he
made
they
appeared
with
large
headlines
like
this
great
speech
by
sir
graball
brilliant
epigram
none
should
have
more
than
they
need
whilst
any
have
less
than
they
need
the
hypocrisy
of
such
a
saying
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
who
was
drawing
a
salary
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
did
not
appear
to
occur
to
anyone
on
the
contrary
the
hired
scribes
of
the
capitalist
press
wrote
columns
of
fulsome
admiration
of
the
miserable
claptrap
and
the
working
men
who
had
elected
this
man
went
into
raptures
over
the
epigram
as
if
it
were
good
to
eat
they
cut
it
out
of
the
papers
and
carried
it
about
with
them
they
showed
it
to
each
other
they
read
it
and
repeated
it
to
each
other
they
wondered
at
it
and
were
delighted
with
it
grinning
and
gibbering
at
each
other
in
the
exuberance
of
their
imbecile
enthusiasm
the
distress
committee
was
not
the
only
body
pretending
to
with
the
poverty
its
efforts
were
supplemented
by
all
the
other
agencies
already
mentioned
the
labour
yard
the
rummage
sales
the
organized
benevolence
society
and
so
on
to
say
nothing
of
a
most
benevolent
scheme
originated
by
the
management
of
sweater
emporium
who
announced
in
a
letter
that
was
published
in
the
local
press
that
they
were
prepared
to
employ
fifty
men
for
one
week
to
carry
sandwich
boards
at
one
shilling
and
a
loaf
of
bread
per
day
they
got
the
men
some
unskilled
labourers
a
few
old
worn
out
artisans
whom
misery
had
deprived
of
the
last
vestiges
of
pride
or
shame
a
number
of
habitual
drunkards
and
loafers
and
a
lot
of
poor
ragged
old
men
old
soldiers
and
others
of
whom
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
they
had
once
been
the
procession
of
sandwich
men
was
headed
by
the
and
the
besotted
wretch
and
each
board
was
covered
with
a
printed
poster
sale
of
ladies
blouses
now
proceeding
at
adam
emporium
besides
this
artful
scheme
of
sweater
for
getting
a
good
advertisement
on
the
cheap
numerous
other
plans
for
providing
employment
or
alleviating
the
prevailing
misery
were
put
forward
in
the
columns
of
the
local
papers
and
at
the
various
meetings
that
were
held
any
foolish
idiotic
useless
suggestion
was
certain
to
receive
respectful
attention
any
crafty
plan
devised
in
his
own
interest
or
for
his
own
profit
by
one
or
other
of
the
crew
of
sweaters
and
landlords
who
controlled
the
town
was
sure
to
be
approved
of
by
the
other
inhabitants
of
mugsborough
the
majority
of
whom
were
persons
of
feeble
intellect
who
not
only
allowed
themselves
to
be
robbed
and
exploited
by
a
few
cunning
scoundrels
but
venerated
and
applauded
them
for
doing
it
chapter
the
brigands
cave
one
evening
in
the
at
cave
there
was
a
meeting
of
a
number
of
the
lights
to
arrange
the
details
of
a
rummage
sale
that
was
to
be
held
in
aid
of
the
unemployed
it
was
an
informal
affair
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
other
luminaries
the
early
arrivals
messrs
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
mr
oyley
sweater
the
borough
surveyor
mr
wireman
the
electrical
engineer
who
had
been
engaged
as
an
to
examine
and
report
on
the
electric
light
works
and
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
all
members
of
the
band
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
discuss
a
number
of
things
they
were
mutually
interested
in
which
were
to
be
dealt
with
at
the
meeting
of
the
town
council
the
next
day
first
there
was
the
affair
of
the
untenanted
kiosk
on
the
grand
parade
this
building
belonged
to
the
corporation
and
cosy
corner
refreshment
coy
of
which
mr
grinder
was
the
managing
director
was
thinking
of
hiring
it
to
open
as
a
refreshment
lounge
provided
the
corporation
would
make
certain
alterations
and
let
the
place
at
a
reasonable
rent
another
item
which
was
to
be
discussed
at
the
council
meeting
was
mr
generous
offer
to
the
corporation
respecting
the
new
drain
connecting
cave
with
the
town
main
the
report
of
mr
wireman
the
electrical
expert
was
also
to
be
dealt
with
and
afterwards
a
resolution
in
favour
of
the
purchase
of
the
mugsborough
electric
light
and
installation
ltd
by
the
town
was
to
be
proposed
in
addition
to
these
matters
several
other
items
including
a
proposal
by
mr
didlum
for
an
important
reform
in
the
matter
of
conducting
the
meetings
of
the
council
formed
subjects
for
animated
conversation
between
the
brigands
and
their
host
during
this
discussion
other
luminaries
arrived
including
several
ladies
and
the
rev
mr
bosher
of
the
church
of
the
whited
sepulchre
the
of
cave
was
now
elaborately
furnished
a
large
mirror
in
a
richly
gilt
frame
reached
from
the
carved
marble
mantelpiece
to
the
cornice
a
magnificent
clock
in
an
alabaster
case
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
and
was
flanked
by
two
exquisitely
painted
and
gilded
vases
of
dresden
ware
the
windows
were
draped
with
costly
hangings
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
luxurious
carpet
and
expensive
rugs
sumptuously
upholstered
couches
and
easy
chairs
added
to
the
comfort
of
the
apartment
which
was
warmed
by
the
immense
fire
of
coal
and
oak
logs
that
blazed
and
crackled
in
the
grate
the
conversation
now
became
general
and
at
times
highly
philosophical
in
character
although
mr
bosher
did
not
take
much
part
being
too
busily
engaged
gobbling
up
the
biscuits
and
tea
and
only
occasionally
spluttering
out
a
reply
when
a
remark
or
question
was
directly
addressed
to
him
this
was
mr
grinder
first
visit
at
the
house
and
he
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
were
decorated
remarking
that
he
had
always
liked
this
japanese
style
mr
bosher
with
his
mouth
full
of
biscuit
mumbled
that
it
was
sweetly
pretty
charming
beautifully
done
must
have
cost
a
lot
of
money
wot
you
call
japanese
though
is
it
observed
didlum
looking
round
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
should
be
inclined
to
say
it
was
rather
more
of
the
er
chinese
or
egyptian
explained
mr
sweater
with
a
smile
got
the
idear
at
the
paris
exhibition
it
simler
to
the
decorations
in
the
halambara
the
palace
of
the
sultan
of
morocco
that
clock
there
is
in
the
same
style
the
case
of
the
clock
referred
to
which
stood
on
a
table
in
a
corner
of
the
room
was
of
fretwork
in
the
form
of
an
indian
mosque
with
a
pointed
dome
and
pinnacles
this
was
the
case
that
mary
linden
had
sold
to
didlum
the
latter
had
had
it
stained
a
dark
colour
and
polished
and
further
improved
it
by
substituting
a
clock
of
more
suitable
design
than
the
one
it
originally
held
mr
sweater
had
noticed
it
in
didlum
window
and
seeing
that
the
design
was
similar
in
character
to
the
painted
decorations
on
the
ceiling
and
walls
of
his
had
purchased
it
went
to
the
paris
exhibition
meself
said
grinder
when
everyone
had
admired
the
exquisite
workmanship
of
the
remember
a
look
at
the
moon
through
that
big
telescope
i
was
never
so
surprised
in
me
life
you
can
see
it
quite
plain
and
it
round
said
didlum
with
a
puzzled
look
of
course
round
you
did
used
to
think
it
was
square
did
yer
of
course
not
but
i
always
used
to
think
it
was
flat
like
a
plate
but
it
round
like
a
football
the
moon
is
a
very
simler
body
to
the
earth
explained
didlum
describing
an
aerial
circle
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
they
moves
through
the
air
together
but
the
earth
is
always
nearest
to
the
sun
and
consequently
once
a
fortnight
the
shadder
of
the
earth
falls
on
the
moon
and
darkens
it
so
that
it
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
the
new
moon
is
caused
by
the
moon
movin
a
little
bit
out
of
the
shadder
and
it
keeps
on
comin
more
and
more
until
we
gets
the
full
moon
and
then
it
goes
back
again
into
the
shadder
and
so
it
keeps
on
for
about
a
minute
everyone
looked
very
solemn
and
the
profound
silence
was
disturbed
only
the
the
crunching
of
the
biscuits
between
the
jaws
of
mr
bosher
and
by
certain
gurglings
in
the
interior
of
that
gentleman
is
a
wonderful
thing
said
mr
sweater
at
length
wagging
his
head
gravely
but
a
lot
of
it
is
mere
theory
you
know
observed
rushton
this
idear
that
the
world
is
round
for
instance
i
fail
to
see
it
and
then
they
say
as
hawstralia
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
underneath
our
feet
in
my
opinion
it
ridiculous
because
if
it
was
true
wot
to
prevent
the
people
droppin
orf
well
of
course
it
very
strange
admitted
sweater
often
thought
of
that
myself
if
it
was
true
we
ought
to
be
able
to
walk
on
the
ceiling
of
this
room
for
instance
but
of
course
we
know
that
impossible
and
i
really
do
see
that
the
other
is
any
more
reasonable
often
noticed
flies
walkin
on
the
ceilin
remarked
didlum
who
felt
called
upon
to
defend
the
globular
theory
but
they
different
replied
rushton
is
provided
by
nature
with
a
gluey
substance
which
oozes
out
of
their
feet
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
them
to
walk
upside
down
one
thing
that
seems
to
me
to
finish
that
idear
once
for
all
said
grinder
that
is
water
always
finds
its
own
level
you
get
away
from
that
and
if
the
world
was
round
as
they
want
us
to
believe
all
the
water
would
run
off
except
just
a
little
at
the
top
to
my
mind
that
settles
the
whole
argymint
thing
that
gets
over
me
continued
rushton
this
according
to
science
the
earth
turns
round
on
its
axle
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
a
minit
well
what
about
when
a
lark
goes
up
in
the
sky
and
stays
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
why
if
it
was
true
that
the
earth
was
turnin
round
at
that
rate
all
the
time
when
the
bird
came
down
it
would
find
itself
of
miles
away
from
the
place
where
it
went
up
from
but
that
does
at
all
the
bird
always
comes
down
in
the
same
spot
and
the
same
thing
applies
to
balloons
and
flyin
machines
said
grinder
it
was
true
that
the
world
is
spinnin
round
on
its
axle
so
quick
as
that
if
a
man
started
out
from
calais
to
fly
to
dover
by
the
time
he
got
to
england
he
find
in
north
america
or
farther
off
still
if
it
was
true
that
the
world
goes
round
the
sun
at
the
rate
they
makes
out
when
a
balloon
went
up
the
earth
would
run
away
from
it
they
never
be
able
to
get
back
again
remarked
rushton
this
was
so
obvious
that
nearly
everyone
said
there
was
probably
something
in
it
and
didlum
could
think
of
no
reply
mr
bosher
upon
being
appealed
to
for
his
opinion
explained
that
science
was
alright
in
its
way
but
unreliable
the
things
scientists
said
yesterday
they
contradicted
today
and
what
they
said
today
they
would
probably
repudiate
tomorrow
it
was
necessary
to
be
very
cautious
before
accepting
any
of
their
assertions
about
science
said
grinder
as
the
holy
man
relapsed
into
silence
and
started
on
another
biscuit
and
a
fresh
cup
of
tea
about
science
reminds
me
of
a
conversation
i
with
dr
weakling
the
other
day
you
know
he
believes
we
all
descended
from
monkeys
everyone
laughed
the
thing
was
so
absurd
the
idea
of
placing
intellectual
beings
on
a
level
with
animals
just
wait
till
you
hear
how
nicely
i
flattened
out
continued
grinder
we
been
arguin
a
long
time
about
wot
called
everlution
or
some
sich
name
and
a
lot
more
that
i
make
no
or
tail
of
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
believe
understood
of
it
i
ses
to
well
i
ses
if
true
that
we
hall
descended
from
monkeys
i
ses
i
think
your
famly
must
left
orf
where
mine
begun
in
the
midst
of
the
laughter
that
greeted
the
conclusion
of
story
it
was
seen
that
mr
bosher
had
become
black
in
the
face
he
was
waving
his
arms
and
writhing
about
like
one
in
a
fit
his
goggle
eyes
bursting
from
their
sockets
whilst
his
huge
stomach
quivering
spasmodically
alternately
contracted
and
expanded
as
if
it
were
about
to
explode
in
the
exuberance
of
his
mirth
the
unfortunate
disciple
had
swallowed
two
biscuits
at
once
everybody
rushed
to
his
assistance
grinder
and
didlum
seized
an
arm
and
a
shoulder
each
and
forced
his
head
down
rushton
punched
him
in
the
back
and
the
ladies
shrieked
with
alarm
they
gave
him
a
big
drink
of
tea
to
help
to
get
the
biscuits
down
and
when
he
at
last
succeeded
in
swallowing
them
he
sat
in
the
armchair
with
his
eyes
and
full
of
tears
which
ran
down
over
his
white
flabby
face
the
arrival
of
the
other
members
of
the
committee
put
an
end
to
the
interesting
discussion
and
they
shortly
afterwards
proceeded
with
the
business
for
which
the
meeting
had
been
called
the
arrangements
for
the
forthcoming
rummage
sale
chapter
the
brigands
at
work
the
next
day
at
the
meeting
of
the
town
council
mr
wireman
report
concerning
the
electric
light
works
was
read
the
expert
opinion
was
so
favourable
and
it
was
endorsed
by
the
borough
engineer
mr
oyley
sweater
that
a
resolution
was
unanimously
carried
in
favour
of
acquiring
the
works
for
the
town
and
a
secret
committee
was
appointed
to
arrange
the
preliminaries
alderman
sweater
then
suggested
that
a
suitable
honorarium
be
voted
to
mr
wireman
for
his
services
this
was
greeted
with
a
murmur
of
approval
from
most
of
the
members
and
mr
didlum
rose
with
the
intention
of
proposing
a
resolution
to
that
effect
when
he
was
interrupted
by
alderman
grinder
who
said
he
could
see
no
sense
in
giving
the
man
a
thing
like
that
not
give
him
a
sum
of
money
several
members
said
hear
to
this
but
some
of
the
others
laughed
ca
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
cried
grinder
angrily
my
part
i
would
give
you
tuppence
for
all
the
honorariums
in
the
country
i
move
that
we
pay
a
sum
of
money
second
that
said
another
member
of
the
band
one
of
those
who
had
cried
hear
alderman
sweater
said
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
little
misunderstanding
and
explained
that
an
honorarium
was
a
sum
of
money
well
in
that
case
i
withdraw
my
resolution
said
grinder
thought
you
wanted
to
give
a
address
or
something
like
that
didlum
now
moved
that
a
letter
of
thanks
and
a
fee
of
fifty
guineas
be
voted
to
mr
wireman
and
this
was
also
unanimously
agreed
to
dr
weakling
said
that
it
seemed
rather
a
lot
but
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
vote
against
it
the
next
business
was
the
proposal
that
the
corporation
should
take
over
the
drain
connecting
mr
sweater
house
with
the
town
main
mr
sweater
being
a
man
proposed
to
hand
this
connecting
drain
which
ran
through
a
private
road
over
to
the
corporation
to
be
theirs
and
their
successors
for
ever
on
condition
that
they
would
pay
him
the
cost
of
construction
and
agreed
to
keep
it
in
proper
repair
after
a
brief
discussion
it
was
decided
to
take
over
the
drain
on
the
terms
offered
and
then
councillor
didlum
proposed
a
vote
of
thanks
to
alderman
sweater
for
his
generosity
in
the
matter
this
was
promptly
seconded
by
councillor
rushton
and
would
have
been
carried
nem
but
for
the
disgraceful
conduct
of
dr
weakling
who
had
the
bad
taste
to
suggest
that
the
amount
was
about
double
what
the
drain
could
possibly
have
cost
to
construct
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
the
corporation
at
all
and
that
they
would
merely
acquire
the
liability
to
keep
it
in
repair
however
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
reply
to
weakling
and
the
band
proceeded
to
the
consideration
of
the
next
business
which
was
mr
grinder
offer
on
behalf
of
the
corner
refreshment
company
to
take
the
kiosk
on
the
grand
parade
mr
grinder
submitted
a
plan
of
certain
alterations
that
he
would
require
the
corporation
to
make
at
the
kiosk
and
provided
the
council
agreed
to
do
this
work
he
was
willing
to
take
a
lease
of
the
place
for
five
years
at
per
year
councillor
didlum
proposed
that
the
offer
of
the
corner
refreshment
ltd
be
accepted
and
the
required
alterations
proceeded
with
at
once
the
kiosk
had
brought
in
no
rent
for
nearly
two
years
but
apart
from
that
consideration
if
they
accepted
this
offer
they
would
be
able
to
set
some
of
the
unemployed
to
work
applause
councillor
rushton
seconded
dr
weakling
pointed
out
that
as
the
proposed
alterations
would
cost
about
according
to
the
estimate
of
the
borough
engineer
and
the
rent
being
only
a
year
it
would
mean
that
the
council
would
be
out
of
pocket
at
the
end
of
the
five
years
to
say
nothing
of
the
expense
of
keeping
the
place
in
repair
during
all
that
time
disturbance
he
moved
as
an
amendment
that
the
alterations
be
made
and
that
they
then
invite
tenders
and
let
the
place
to
the
highest
bidder
great
uproar
councillor
rushton
said
he
was
disgusted
with
the
attitude
taken
up
by
that
man
weakling
applause
perhaps
it
was
hardly
right
to
call
him
a
man
hear
hear
in
the
matter
of
these
alterations
they
had
had
the
use
of
councillor
grinder
brains
it
was
he
who
first
thought
of
making
these
improvements
in
the
kiosk
and
therefore
he
or
rather
the
company
he
represented
had
a
moral
right
to
the
tenancy
loud
cheers
dr
weakling
said
that
he
thought
it
was
understood
that
when
a
man
was
elected
to
that
council
it
was
because
he
was
supposed
to
be
willing
to
use
his
brains
for
the
benefit
of
his
constituents
sardonic
laughter
the
mayor
asked
if
there
was
any
seconder
to
weakling
amendment
and
as
there
was
not
the
original
proposition
was
put
and
carried
councillor
rushton
suggested
that
a
large
shelter
with
seating
accommodation
for
about
two
hundred
persons
should
be
erected
on
the
grand
parade
near
the
kiosk
the
shelter
would
serve
as
a
protection
against
rain
or
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
summer
it
would
add
materially
to
the
comfort
of
visitors
and
would
be
a
notable
addition
to
the
attractions
of
the
town
councillor
didlum
said
it
was
a
very
good
idear
and
proposed
that
the
surveyor
be
instructed
to
get
out
the
plans
dr
weakling
opposed
the
motion
laughter
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
object
was
to
benefit
not
the
town
but
mr
grinder
disturbance
if
this
shelter
were
erected
it
would
increase
the
value
of
the
kiosk
as
a
refreshment
bar
by
a
hundred
per
cent
if
mr
grinder
wanted
a
shelter
for
his
customers
he
should
pay
for
it
himself
uproar
he
dr
weakling
was
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
this
was
a
job
loud
cries
of
out
and
terrific
uproar
weakling
did
not
apologize
or
withdraw
but
he
said
no
more
proposition
was
carried
and
the
went
on
to
the
next
item
on
the
agenda
which
was
a
proposal
by
councillor
didlum
to
increase
the
salary
of
mr
oyley
sweater
the
borough
engineer
from
fifteen
pounds
to
seventeen
pounds
per
week
councillor
didlum
said
that
when
they
had
a
good
man
they
ought
to
appreciate
him
applause
compared
with
other
officials
the
borough
engineer
was
not
fairly
paid
hear
hear
the
clerk
received
seventeen
pounds
a
week
the
town
clerk
seventeen
pounds
per
week
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
he
thought
those
gentlemen
were
overpaid
far
from
it
hear
hear
it
was
not
that
they
got
too
much
but
that
the
engineer
got
too
little
how
could
they
expect
a
man
like
that
to
exist
on
a
paltry
fifteen
pounds
a
week
why
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
sweating
hear
hear
he
had
much
pleasure
in
moving
that
the
borough
engineer
salary
be
increased
to
seventeen
pounds
a
week
and
that
his
annual
holiday
be
extended
from
a
fortnight
to
one
calendar
month
with
hard
la
he
begged
pardon
with
full
pay
loud
cheers
councillor
rushton
said
that
he
did
not
propose
to
make
a
long
speech
it
was
not
necessary
he
would
content
himself
with
formally
seconding
councillor
didlum
excellent
proposition
applause
councillor
weakling
whose
rising
was
greeted
with
derisive
laughter
said
he
must
oppose
the
resolution
he
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
he
was
not
actuated
by
any
feeling
of
personal
animosity
towards
the
borough
engineer
but
at
the
same
time
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
say
that
in
his
dr
weakling
opinion
that
official
would
be
dear
at
half
the
price
they
were
now
paying
him
disturbance
he
did
not
appear
to
understand
his
business
nearly
all
the
work
that
was
done
cost
in
the
end
about
double
what
the
borough
engineer
estimated
it
could
be
done
for
liar
he
considered
him
to
be
a
grossly
incompetent
person
uproar
and
was
of
opinion
that
if
they
were
to
advertise
they
could
get
dozens
of
better
men
who
would
be
glad
to
do
the
work
for
five
pounds
a
week
he
moved
that
mr
oyley
sweater
be
asked
to
resign
and
that
they
advertise
for
a
man
at
five
pounds
a
week
great
uproar
councillor
grinder
rose
to
a
point
of
order
he
appealed
to
the
chairman
to
squash
the
amendment
applause
councillor
didlum
remarked
that
he
supposed
councillor
grinder
meant
in
that
case
he
would
support
the
suggestion
councillor
grinder
said
it
was
about
time
they
put
a
stopper
on
that
feller
weakling
he
grinder
did
not
care
whether
they
called
it
squashing
or
quashing
it
was
all
the
same
so
long
as
they
nipped
him
in
the
bud
cheers
the
man
was
a
disgrace
to
the
council
always
interfering
and
hindering
the
business
the
mayor
alderman
sweater
said
that
he
did
not
think
it
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
that
council
to
waste
any
more
time
over
this
scurrilous
amendment
applause
he
was
proud
to
say
that
it
had
never
even
been
seconded
and
therefore
he
would
put
mr
resolution
a
proposition
which
he
had
no
hesitation
in
saying
reflected
the
highest
credit
upon
that
gentleman
and
upon
all
those
who
supported
it
vociferous
cheers
all
those
who
were
in
favour
signified
their
approval
in
the
customary
manner
and
as
weakling
was
the
only
one
opposed
the
resolution
was
carried
and
the
meeting
proceeded
to
the
next
business
councillor
rushton
said
that
several
influential
ratepayers
and
employers
of
labour
had
complained
to
him
about
the
high
wages
of
the
corporation
workmen
some
of
whom
were
paid
an
hour
sevenpence
an
hour
was
the
maximum
wage
paid
to
skilled
workmen
by
private
employers
in
that
town
and
he
failed
to
see
why
the
corporation
should
pay
more
hear
hear
it
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
men
in
the
employment
of
private
firms
tending
to
make
them
dissatisfied
with
their
wages
the
same
state
of
affairs
prevailed
with
regard
to
the
unskilled
labourers
in
the
employment
private
employers
could
get
that
class
of
labour
for
or
fivepence
an
hour
and
yet
the
corporation
paid
and
even
sixpence
for
the
same
class
of
work
shame
it
was
not
fair
to
the
ratepayers
hear
hear
considering
that
the
men
in
the
employment
of
the
corporation
had
almost
constant
work
if
there
was
to
be
a
difference
at
all
they
should
get
not
more
but
less
than
those
who
worked
for
private
firms
cheers
he
moved
that
the
wages
of
the
corporation
workmen
be
reduced
in
all
cases
to
the
same
level
as
those
paid
by
private
firms
councillor
grinder
seconded
he
said
it
amounted
to
a
positive
scandal
why
in
the
some
of
these
men
drew
as
much
as
in
a
single
week
shame
and
it
was
quite
common
for
unskilled
labourers
fellers
who
did
nothing
but
the
very
hardest
and
most
laborious
work
sich
as
carrying
sacks
of
cement
or
digging
up
the
roads
to
get
at
the
drains
and
easy
jobs
to
walk
off
with
a
week
sensation
he
had
often
noticed
some
of
these
men
swaggering
about
the
town
on
sundays
dressed
like
millionaires
and
cigared
up
they
seemed
quite
a
different
class
of
men
from
those
who
worked
for
private
firms
and
to
look
at
the
way
some
of
their
children
was
dressed
you
think
their
fathers
was
cabinet
minstrels
no
wonder
the
ratepayers
complained
ot
the
high
rates
another
grievance
was
that
all
the
corporation
workmen
were
allowed
two
days
holiday
every
year
in
addition
to
the
bank
holidays
and
were
paid
for
them
cries
of
etc
no
private
contractor
paid
his
men
for
bank
holidays
and
why
should
the
corporation
do
so
he
had
much
pleasure
in
seconding
councillor
rushton
resolution
councillor
weakling
opposed
the
motion
he
thought
that
a
week
was
little
enough
for
a
man
to
keep
a
wife
and
family
with
rot
even
if
all
the
men
got
it
regularly
which
they
did
not
members
should
consider
what
was
the
average
amount
per
week
throughout
the
whole
year
not
merely
the
busy
time
and
if
they
did
that
they
would
find
that
even
the
skilled
men
did
not
average
more
than
a
week
and
in
many
cases
not
so
much
if
this
subject
had
not
been
introduced
by
councillor
rushton
he
dr
weakling
had
intended
to
propose
that
the
wages
of
the
corporation
workmen
should
be
increased
to
the
standard
recognized
by
the
trades
unions
loud
laughter
it
had
been
proved
that
the
notoriously
short
lives
of
the
working
people
whose
average
span
of
life
was
about
twenty
years
less
than
that
of
the
classes
their
increasingly
inferior
physique
and
the
high
rate
of
mortality
amongst
their
children
was
caused
by
the
wretched
remuneration
they
received
for
hard
and
tiring
work
the
excessive
number
of
hours
they
have
to
work
when
employed
the
bad
quality
of
their
food
the
badly
constructed
and
insanitary
homes
their
poverty
compels
them
to
occupy
and
the
anxiety
worry
and
depression
of
mind
they
have
to
suffer
when
out
of
employment
cries
of
and
loud
laughter
councillor
didlum
said
it
was
a
very
good
word
to
describe
the
disease
that
was
sapping
the

of
society
and
destroying
the
health
and
happiness

the
very
lives
of
so
many
of
their
fellow
countrymen
and
women
renewed
merriment
and
shouts
of
and

a
red
tie
he
appealed
to
the
members
to
reject
the
resolution
he
was
very
glad
to
say
that
he
believed
it
was
true
that
the
workmen
in
the
employ
of
the
corporation
were
a
little
better
off
than
those
in
the
employ
of
private
contractors
and
if
it
were
so
it
was
as
it
should
be
they
had
need
to
be
better
off
than
the
poor
wretches
who
worked
for
private
firms
councillor
didlum
said
that
it
was
very
evident
that
dr
weakling
had
obtained
his
seat
on
that
council
by
false
pretences
if
he
had
told
the
ratepayers
that
he
was
a
socialist
they
would
never
have
elected
him
hear
hear
practically
every
christian
minister
in
the
country
would
agree
with
him
didlum
when
he
said
that
the
poverty
of
the
working
classes
was
caused
not
by
the
remuneration
they
receive
as
wages
but
by
drink
loud
applause
and
he
was
very
sure
that
the
testimony
of
the
clergy
of
all
denominations
was
more
to
be
relied
upon
than
the
opinion
of
a
man
like
dr
weakling
hear
hear
dr
weakling
said
that
if
some
of
the
clergymen
referred
to
or
some
of
the
members
of
the
council
had
to
exist
and
toil
amid
the
same
sordid
surroundings
overcrowding
and
ignorance
as
some
of
the
working
classes
they
would
probably
seek
to
secure
some
share
of
pleasure
and
forgetfulness
in
drink
themselves
great
uproar
and
shouts
of
councillor
grinder
said
that
even
if
it
was
true
that
the
haverage
lives
of
the
working
classes
was
twenty
years
shorter
than
those
of
the
better
classes
he
could
not
see
what
it
had
got
to
do
with
dr
weakling

so
long
as
the
working
class
was
contented
to

years

failed
to

what
it
had
got
to
do
with
other
people
they
was
not
runnin
short
of
workers

they
there
was
still
plenty
of
left
laughter
so
long
as
the
workin
class
was
satisfied
to
die

let
die
orf
it
was
a
free
country
applause
the
workin

ad
arst
dr
weakling
to
stick
up
for
them
had
they
if
they
was
satisfied
they
would
stick
up
for
theirselves
the
working
men
did
want
the
likes
of
dr
weakling
to
stick
up
for
them
and
they
would
let
know
it
when
the
next
election
came
round
if
he
grinder
was
a
wordly
man
he
would
not
mind
betting
that
the
workin
men
of
dr
weakling

would
give
him
dirty
kick
out
next
november
applause
councillor
weakling
who
knew
that
this
was
probably
true
made
no
further
protest
rushton
proposition
was
carried
and
then
the
clerk
announced
that
the
next
item
was
the
resolution
mr
didlum
had
given
notice
of
at
the
last
meeting
and
the
mayor
accordingly
called
upon
that
gentleman
councillor
didlum
who
was
received
with
loud
cheers
said
that
unfortunately
a
certain
member
of
that
council
seemed
to
think
he
had
a
right
to
oppose
nearly
everything
that
was
brought
forward
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
band
glared
malignantly
at
weakling
he
hoped
that
for
once
the
individual
he
referred
to
would
have
the
decency
to
restrain
himself
because
the
resolution
he
didlum
was
about
to
have
the
honour
of
proposing
was
one
that
he
believed
no
man
no
matter
what
his
politics
or
religious
opinions
could
possibly
object
to
and
he
trusted
that
for
the
credit
of
the
council
it
would
be
entered
on
the
records
as
an
unopposed
motion
the
resolution
was
as
follows
from
this
date
all
the
meetings
of
this
council
shall
be
opened
with
prayer
and
closed
with
the
singing
of
the
doxology
loud
applause
councillor
rushton
seconded
the
resolution
which
was
also
supported
by
mr
grinder
who
said
that
at
a
time
like
the
present
when
there
was
sich
a
lot
of
infiddles
about
who
said
that
we
all
came
from
monkeys
the
council
would
be
showing
a
good
example
to
the
working
classes
by
adopting
the
resolution
councillor
weakling
said
nothing
so
the
new
rule
was
carried
nem
and
as
there
was
no
more
business
to
be
done
it
was
put
into
operation
for
the
first
time
there
and
then
mr
sweater
conducting
the
singing
with
a
roll
of
paper
the
plan
of
the
drain
of
cave
and
each
member
singing
a
different
tune
weakling
withdrew
during
the
singing
and
afterwards
before
the
band
dispersed
it
was
agreed
that
a
certain
number
of
them
were
to
meet
the
chief
at
the
cave
on
the
following
evening
to
arrange
the
details
of
the
proposed
raid
on
the
finances
of
the
town
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
electric
light
works
chapter
vive
la
system
the
alterations
which
the
corporation
had
undertaken
to
make
in
the
kiosk
on
the
grand
parade
provided
employment
for
several
carpenters
and
plasterers
for
about
three
weeks
and
afterwards
for
several
painters
this
fact
was
sufficient
to
secure
the
working
unqualified
approval
of
the
action
of
the
council
in
letting
the
place
to
grinder
and
councillor
weakling
opposition
the
reasons
of
which
they
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
or
understand
they
as
heartily
condemned
all
they
knew
or
cared
was
that
he
had
tried
to
prevent
the
work
being
done
and
that
he
had
referred
in
insulting
terms
to
the
working
men
of
the
town
what
right
had
he
to
call
them
poor
wretches
if
it
came
to
being
according
to
all
accounts
he
was
any
too
well
orf
hisself
some
of
those
blokes
who
went
swaggering
about
in
and
was
just
as
up
as
anyone
else
if
the
truth
was
known
as
for
the
corporation
workmen
it
was
quite
right
that
their
wages
should
be
reduced
why
should
they
get
more
money
than
anyone
else
us
what
got
to
find
the
money
they
said
the
ratepayers
and
why
should
we
have
to
pay
them
more
wages
than
we
get
ourselves
and
why
should
they
be
paid
for
holidays
any
more
than
us
during
the
next
few
weeks
the
dearth
of
employment
continued
for
of
course
the
work
at
the
kiosk
and
the
few
others
jobs
that
were
being
done
did
not
make
much
difference
to
the
general
situation
groups
of
workmen
stood
at
the
corners
or
walked
aimlessly
about
the
streets
most
of
them
no
longer
troubled
to
go
to
the
different
firms
to
ask
for
work
they
were
usually
told
that
they
would
be
sent
for
if
wanted
during
this
time
owen
did
his
best
to
convert
the
other
men
to
his
views
he
had
accumulated
a
little
library
of
socialist
books
and
pamphlets
which
he
lent
to
those
he
hoped
to
influence
some
of
them
took
these
books
and
promised
with
the
air
of
men
who
were
conferring
a
great
favour
that
they
would
read
them
as
a
rule
when
they
returned
them
it
was
with
vague
expressions
of
approval
but
they
usually
evinced
a
disinclination
to
discuss
the
contents
in
detail
because
in
nine
instances
out
of
ten
they
had
not
attempted
to
read
them
as
for
those
who
did
make
a
effort
to
do
so
in
the
majority
of
cases
their
minds
were
so
rusty
and
stultified
by
long
years
of
disuse
that
although
the
pamphlets
were
generally
written
in
such
simple
language
that
a
child
might
have
understood
the
argument
was
generally
too
obscure
to
be
grasped
by
men
whose
minds
were
addled
by
the
stories
told
them
by
their
liberal
and
tory
masters
some
when
owen
offered
to
lend
them
some
books
or
pamphlets
refused
to
accept
them
and
others
who
did
him
the
great
favour
of
accepting
them
afterwards
boasted
that
they
had
used
them
as
toilet
paper
owen
frequently
entered
into
long
arguments
with
the
other
men
saying
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
state
to
provide
productive
work
for
all
those
who
were
willing
to
do
it
some
few
of
them
listened
like
men
who
only
vaguely
understood
but
were
willing
to
be
convinced
mate
it
right
enough
what
you
say
they
would
remark
ought
to
be
done
others
ridiculed
this
doctrine
of
state
employment
it
was
all
very
fine
but
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
and
then
those
who
had
been
disposed
to
agree
with
owen
could
relapse
into
their
old
apathy
there
were
others
who
did
not
listen
so
quietly
but
shouted
with
many
curses
that
it
was
the
likes
of
such
fellows
as
owen
who
were
responsible
for
all
the
depression
in
trade
all
this
talk
about
socialism
and
state
employment
was
frightening
capital
out
of
the
country
those
who
had
money
were
afraid
to
invest
it
in
industries
or
to
have
any
work
done
for
fear
they
would
be
robbed
when
owen
quoted
statistics
to
prove
that
as
far
as
commerce
and
the
quantity
produced
of
commodities
of
all
kinds
was
concerned
the
last
year
had
been
a
record
one
they
became
more
infuriated
than
ever
and
talked
threateningly
of
what
they
would
like
to
do
to
those
bloody
socialists
who
were
upsetting
everything
one
day
crass
who
was
one
of
these
upholders
of
the
existing
system
scored
off
owen
finely
a
little
group
of
them
were
standing
talking
in
the
wage
slave
market
near
the
fountain
in
the
course
of
the
argument
owen
made
the
remark
that
under
existing
conditions
life
was
not
worth
living
and
crass
said
that
if
he
really
thought
so
there
was
no
compulsion
about
it
if
he
was
satisfied
if
he
did
want
to
live
he
could
go
and
die
why
the
hell
did
he
go
and
make
a
hole
in
the
water
or
cut
his
bloody
throat
on
this
particular
occasion
the
subject
of
the
argument
was
at
first
the
recent
increase
of
the
borough
engineer
salary
to
seventeen
pounds
per
week
owen
had
said
it
was
robbery
but
the
majority
of
the
others
expressed
their
approval
of
the
increase
they
asked
owen
if
he
expected
a
man
like
that
to
work
for
nothing
it
was
not
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
likes
of
themselves
they
said
that
as
for
it
being
robbery
owen
would
be
very
glad
to
have
the
chance
of
getting
it
himself
most
of
them
seemed
to
think
the
fact
that
anyone
would
be
glad
to
have
seventeen
pounds
a
week
proved
that
it
was
right
for
them
to
pay
that
amount
to
the
borough
engineer
usually
whenever
owen
reflected
upon
the
gross
injustices
and
inhumanity
of
the
existing
social
disorder
he
became
convinced
that
it
could
not
possibly
last
it
was
bound
to
fall
to
pieces
because
of
its
own
rottenness
it
was
not
just
it
was
not
common
sense
and
therefore
it
could
not
endure
but
always
after
one
of
these
arguments
or
rather
disputes
with
his
fellow
workmen
he
almost
relapsed
into
hopelessness
and
despondency
for
then
he
realized
how
vast
and
how
strong
are
the
fortifications
that
surround
the
present
system
the
great
barriers
and
ramparts
of
invincible
ignorance
apathy
and
which
will
have
to
be
broken
down
before
the
system
of
society
of
which
they
are
the
defences
can
be
swept
away
at
other
times
as
he
thought
of
this
marvellous
system
it
presented
itself
to
him
in
such
an
aspect
of
almost
comical
absurdity
that
he
was
forced
to
laugh
and
to
wonder
whether
it
really
existed
at
all
or
if
it
were
only
an
illusion
of
his
own
disordered
mind
one
of
the
things
that
the
human
race
needed
in
order
to
exist
was
shelter
so
with
much
painful
labour
they
had
constructed
a
large
number
of
houses
thousands
of
these
houses
were
now
standing
unoccupied
while
millions
of
the
people
who
had
helped
to
build
the
houses
were
either
homeless
or
herding
together
in
overcrowded
hovels
these
human
beings
had
such
a
strange
system
of
arranging
their
affairs
that
if
anyone
were
to
go
and
burn
down
a
lot
of
the
houses
he
would
be
conferring
a
great
boon
upon
those
who
had
built
them
because
such
an
act
would
a
lot
more
work
another
very
comical
thing
was
that
thousands
of
people
wore
broken
boots
and
ragged
clothes
while
millions
of
pairs
of
boots
and
abundance
of
clothing
which
they
had
helped
to
make
were
locked
up
in
warehouses
and
the
system
had
the
keys
thousands
of
people
lacked
the
necessaries
of
life
the
necessaries
of
life
are
all
produced
by
work
the
people
who
lacked
begged
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
create
those
things
of
which
they
stood
in
need
but
the
system
prevented
them
from
so
doing
if
anyone
asked
the
system
why
it
prevented
these
people
from
producing
the
things
of
which
they
were
in
want
the
system
replied
they
have
already
produced
too
much
the
markets
are
glutted
the
warehouses
are
filled
and
overflowing
and
there
is
nothing
more
for
them
to
do
there
was
in
existence
a
huge
accumulation
of
everything
necessary
a
great
number
of
the
people
whose
labour
had
produced
that
vast
store
were
now
living
in
want
but
the
system
said
that
they
could
not
be
permitted
to
partake
of
the
things
they
had
created
then
after
a
time
when
these
people
being
reduced
to
the
last
extreme
of
misery
cried
out
that
they
and
their
children
were
dying
of
hunger
the
system
grudgingly
unlocked
the
doors
of
the
great
warehouses
and
taking
out
a
small
part
of
the
things
that
were
stored
within
distributed
it
amongst
the
famished
workers
at
the
same
time
reminding
them
that
it
was
charity
because
all
the
things
in
the
warehouses
although
they
had
been
made
by
the
workers
were
now
the
property
of
the
people
who
do
nothing
and
then
the
starving
bootless
ragged
stupid
wretches
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
system
and
offered
up
their
children
as
living
sacrifices
upon
its
altars
saying
beautiful
system
is
the
only
one
possible
and
the
best
that
human
wisdom
can
devise
may
the
system
live
for
ever
cursed
be
those
who
seek
to
destroy
the
system
as
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
forced
itself
upon
him
owen
in
spite
of
the
unhappiness
he
felt
at
the
sight
of
all
the
misery
by
which
he
was
surrounded
laughed
aloud
and
said
to
himself
that
if
he
was
sane
then
all
these
people
must
be
mad
in
the
face
of
such
colossal
imbecility
it
was
absurd
to
hope
for
any
immediate
improvement
the
little
already
accomplished
was
the
work
of
a
few
enthusiasts
battling
against
the
opposition
of
those
they
sought
to
benefit
and
the
results
of
their
labours
were
in
many
instances
as
pearls
cast
before
the
swine
who
stood
watching
for
opportunities
to
fall
upon
and
rend
their
benefactors
there
was
only
one
hope
it
was
possible
that
the
monopolists
encouraged
by
the
extraordinary
stupidity
and
apathy
of
the
people
would
proceed
to
lay
upon
them
even
greater
burdens
until
at
last
goaded
by
suffering
and
not
having
sufficient
intelligence
to
understand
any
other
remedy
these
miserable
wretches
would
turn
upon
their
oppressors
and
drown
both
them
and
their
system
in
a
sea
of
blood
besides
the
work
at
the
kiosk
towards
the
end
of
march
things
gradually
began
to
improve
in
other
directions
several
firms
began
to
take
on
a
few
hands
several
large
empty
houses
that
were
relet
had
to
be
renovated
for
their
new
tenants
and
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
inside
work
arising
out
of
the
annual
in
other
houses
there
was
not
enough
work
to
keep
everyone
employed
and
most
of
those
who
were
taken
on
as
a
rule
only
managed
to
make
a
few
hours
a
week
but
still
it
was
better
than
absolute
idleness
and
there
also
began
to
be
talk
of
several
large
outside
jobs
that
were
to
be
done
as
soon
as
the
weather
was
settled
this
bad
weather
by
the
way
was
a
sort
of
boon
to
the
defenders
of
the
present
system
who
were
for
sensible
arguments
to
explain
the
cause
of
poverty
one
of
the
principal
causes
was
of
course
the
weather
which
was
keeping
everything
back
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
if
only
the
weather
would
allow
there
would
always
be
plenty
of
work
and
poverty
would
be
abolished
rushton
had
a
fair
share
of
what
work
there
was
and
crass
sawkins
slyme
and
owen
were
kept
employed
pretty
regularly
although
they
did
not
start
until
half
past
eight
and
left
off
at
four
at
different
houses
in
various
parts
of
the
town
they
had
ceilings
to
wash
off
and
distemper
to
strip
the
old
paper
from
the
walls
and
to
repaint
and
paper
the
rooms
and
sometimes
there
were
the
venetian
blinds
to
repair
and
repaint
occasionally
a
few
extra
hands
were
taken
on
for
a
few
days
and
discharged
again
as
soon
as
the
job
they
were
taken
on
to
do
was
finished
the
defenders
of
the
existing
system
may
possibly
believe
that
the
knowledge
that
they
would
be
discharged
directly
the
job
was
done
was
a
very
good
incentive
to
industry
that
they
would
naturally
under
these
circumstances
do
their
best
to
get
the
work
done
as
quickly
as
possible
but
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
most
of
the
defenders
of
the
existing
system
are
so
constituted
that
they
can
believe
anything
provided
it
is
not
true
and
sufficiently
silly
all
the
same
it
was
a
fact
that
the
workmen
did
do
their
very
best
to
get
over
this
work
in
the
shortest
possible
time
because
although
they
knew
that
to
do
so
was
contrary
to
their
own
interests
they
also
knew
that
it
would
be
very
much
more
contrary
to
their
interests
not
to
do
so
their
only
chance
of
being
kept
on
if
other
work
came
in
was
to
tear
into
it
for
all
they
were
worth
consequently
most
of
the
work
was
rushed
and
botched
and
slobbered
over
in
about
half
the
time
that
it
would
have
taken
to
do
it
properly
rooms
for
which
the
customers
paid
to
have
three
coats
of
paint
were
scamped
with
one
or
two
what
misery
did
not
know
about
scamping
and
faking
the
work
the
men
suggested
to
and
showed
him
in
the
hope
of
currying
favour
with
him
in
order
that
they
might
get
the
preference
over
others
and
be
sent
for
when
the
next
job
came
in
this
is
the
principal
incentive
provided
by
the
present
system
the
incentive
to
cheat
these
fellows
cheated
the
customers
of
their
money
they
cheated
themselves
and
their
fellow
workmen
of
work
and
their
children
of
bread
but
it
was
all
for
a
good
cause
to
make
profit
for
their
master
harlow
and
slyme
did
one
job
a
room
that
rushton
had
contracted
to
paint
three
coats
it
was
finished
with
two
and
the
men
cleared
away
their
paints
the
next
day
when
slyme
went
there
to
paper
the
room
the
lady
of
the
house
said
that
the
painting
was
not
yet
finished
it
was
to
have
another
coat
slyme
assured
her
that
it
had
already
had
three
but
as
the
lady
insisted
slyme
went
to
the
shop
and
sought
out
misery
harlow
had
been
stood
off
as
there
was
not
another
job
in
just
then
but
fortunately
he
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
street
outside
the
shop
so
they
called
him
and
then
the
three
of
them
went
round
to
the
job
and
swore
that
the
room
had
had
three
coats
the
lady
protested
that
it
was
not
so
she
had
watched
the
progress
of
the
work
besides
it
was
impossible
they
had
only
been
there
three
days
the
first
day
they
had
not
put
any
paint
on
at
all
they
had
done
the
ceiling
and
stripped
the
walls
the
painting
was
not
started
till
the
second
day
how
then
could
it
have
had
three
coats
misery
explained
the
mystery
he
said
that
for
first
coating
they
had
an
extra
special
very
paint
paint
that
dried
so
quickly
that
they
were
able
to
give
the
work
two
coats
in
one
day
for
instance
one
man
did
the
window
the
other
the
door
when
these
were
finished
both
men
did
the
skirting
by
the
time
the
skirting
was
finished
the
door
and
window
were
dry
enough
to
second
coat
and
then
on
the
following
day
the
finishing
coat
of
course
this
extra
special
paint
was
very
expensive
but
the
firm
did
not
mind
that
they
knew
that
most
of
their
customers
wished
to
have
their
work
finished
as
quickly
as
possible
and
their
study
was
to
give
satisfaction
to
the
customers
this
explanation
satisfied
the
lady
a
widow
making
a
precarious
living
by
taking
in
lodgers
who
was
the
more
easily
deceived
because
she
regarded
misery
as
a
very
holy
man
having
seen
him
preaching
in
the
street
on
many
occasions
there
was
another
job
at
another
that
owen
and
easton
did
two
rooms
which
had
to
be
painted
three
coats
of
white
paint
and
one
of
enamel
making
four
coats
altogether
that
was
what
the
firm
had
contracted
to
do
as
the
old
paint
in
these
rooms
was
of
a
rather
dark
shade
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
give
the
work
three
coats
before
enamelling
it
misery
wanted
them
to
let
it
go
with
two
but
owen
pointed
out
that
if
they
did
so
it
would
be
such
a
ghastly
mess
that
it
would
never
pass
after
thinking
the
matter
over
for
a
few
minutes
misery
told
them
to
go
on
with
the
third
coat
of
paint
then
he
went
downstairs
and
asked
to
see
the
lady
of
the
house
he
explained
to
her
that
in
consequence
of
the
old
paint
being
so
dark
he
found
that
it
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
to
give
the
work
four
coats
before
enamelling
it
of
course
they
had
agreed
for
only
three
but
as
they
always
made
a
point
of
doing
their
work
in
a
manner
rather
than
not
make
a
good
job
they
would
give
it
the
extra
coat
for
nothing
but
he
was
sure
she
would
not
wish
them
to
do
that
the
lady
said
that
she
did
not
want
them
to
work
for
nothing
and
she
wanted
it
done
properly
if
it
were
necessary
to
give
it
an
extra
coat
they
must
do
so
and
she
would
pay
for
it
how
much
would
it
be
misery
told
her
the
lady
was
satisfied
and
misery
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
then
he
went
upstairs
again
and
warned
owen
and
easton
to
be
sure
to
say
if
they
were
asked
that
the
work
had
had
four
coats
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
blame
misery
or
rushton
for
not
wishing
to
do
good
honest
work
there
was
no
incentive
when
they
secured
a
contract
if
they
had
thought
first
of
making
the
very
best
possible
job
of
it
they
would
not
have
made
so
much
profit
the
incentive
was
not
to
do
the
work
as
well
as
possible
but
to
do
as
little
as
possible
the
incentive
was
not
to
make
good
work
but
to
make
good
profit
the
same
rule
applied
to
the
workers
they
could
not
justly
be
blamed
for
not
doing
good
work
there
was
no
incentive
to
do
good
work
requires
time
and
pains
most
of
them
would
have
liked
to
take
time
and
pains
because
all
those
who
are
capable
of
doing
good
work
find
pleasure
and
happiness
in
doing
it
and
have
pride
in
it
when
done
but
there
was
no
incentive
unless
the
certainty
of
getting
the
sack
could
be
called
an
incentive
for
it
was
a
moral
certainty
that
any
man
who
was
caught
taking
time
and
pains
with
his
work
would
be
promptly
presented
with
the
order
of
the
boot
but
there
was
plenty
of
incentive
to
hurry
and
scamp
and
slobber
and
botch
there
was
another
job
at
a
two
rooms
to
be
painted
and
papered
the
landlord
paid
for
the
work
but
the
tenant
had
the
privilege
of
choosing
the
paper
she
could
have
any
pattern
she
liked
so
long
as
the
cost
did
not
exceed
one
shilling
per
roll
estimate
being
for
paper
of
that
price
misery
sent
her
several
patterns
of
sixpenny
papers
marked
at
a
shilling
to
choose
from
but
she
did
not
fancy
any
of
them
and
said
that
she
would
come
to
the
shop
to
make
her
selection
so
hunter
tore
round
to
the
shop
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
there
before
her
in
his
haste
to
dismount
he
fell
off
his
bicycle
into
the
muddy
road
and
nearly
smashed
the
window
with
the
of
the
machine
as
he
placed
it
against
the
shop
front
before
going
in
without
waiting
to
clean
the
mud
off
his
clothes
he
ordered
budd
the
shopman
to
get
out
rolls
of
all
the
sixpenny
papers
they
had
and
then
they
both
set
to
work
and
altered
the
price
marked
upon
them
from
sixpence
to
a
shilling
then
they
got
out
a
number
of
shilling
papers
and
altered
the
price
marked
upon
them
changing
it
from
a
shilling
to
one
and
six
when
the
unfortunate
woman
arrived
misery
was
waiting
for
her
with
a
benign
smile
upon
his
long
visage
he
showed
her
all
the
sixpenny
ones
but
she
did
not
like
any
of
them
so
after
a
while
nimrod
suggested
that
perhaps
she
would
like
a
paper
of
a
little
better
quality
and
she
could
pay
the
trifling
difference
out
of
her
own
pocket
then
he
showed
her
the
shilling
papers
that
he
had
marked
up
to
one
and
sixpence
and
eventually
the
lady
selected
one
of
these
and
paid
the
extra
sixpence
per
roll
herself
as
nimrod
suggested
there
were
fifteen
rolls
of
paper
altogether
seven
for
one
room
and
eight
for
the
other
so
that
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
profit
on
the
sale
of
the
paper
about
two
hundred
and
per
the
firm
made
seven
and
sixpence
on
this
transaction
they
might
have
done
better
out
of
the
job
itself
if
slyme
had
not
been
hanging
the
paper
for
the
two
rooms
being
of
the
same
pattern
he
could
easily
have
managed
to
do
them
with
fourteen
rolls
in
fact
that
was
all
he
did
use
but
he
cut
up
and
partly
destroyed
the
one
that
was
over
so
that
he
could
charge
for
hanging
it
owen
was
working
there
at
the
same
time
for
the
painting
of
the
rooms
was
not
done
before
slyme
papered
them
the
finishing
coat
was
put
on
after
the
paper
was
hung
he
noticed
slyme
destroying
the
paper
and
guessing
the
reason
asked
him
how
he
could
reconcile
such
conduct
as
that
with
his
profession
of
religion
slyme
replied
that
the
fact
that
he
was
a
christian
did
not
imply
that
he
never
did
anything
wrong
if
he
committed
a
sin
he
was
a
christian
all
the
same
and
it
would
be
forgiven
him
for
the
sake
of
the
blood
as
for
this
affair
of
the
paper
it
was
a
matter
between
himself
and
god
and
owen
had
no
right
to
set
himself
up
as
a
judge
in
addition
to
all
this
work
there
were
a
number
of
funerals
crass
and
slyme
did
very
well
out
of
it
all
working
all
day
or
painting
and
sometimes
part
of
the
night
painting
venetian
blinds
or
polishing
coffins
and
taking
them
home
to
say
nothing
of
the
lifting
in
of
the
corpses
and
afterwards
acting
as
bearers
as
time
went
on
the
number
of
small
jobs
increased
and
as
the
days
grew
longer
the
men
were
allowed
to
put
in
a
greater
number
of
hours
most
of
the
firms
had
some
work
but
there
was
never
enough
to
keep
all
the
men
in
the
town
employed
at
the
same
time
it
worked
like
this
every
firm
had
a
certain
number
of
men
who
were
regarded
as
the
regular
hands
when
there
was
any
work
to
do
they
got
the
preference
over
strangers
or
outsiders
when
things
were
busy
outsiders
were
taken
on
temporarily
when
the
work
fell
off
these
casual
hands
were
the
first
to
be
still
if
it
continued
to
fall
off
the
old
hands
were
also
stood
still
in
order
of
seniority
the
older
hands
being
preferred
to
strangers
so
long
of
course
as
they
were
not
old
in
the
sense
of
being
aged
or
inefficient
this
kind
of
thing
usually
continued
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
in
good
years
the
men
of
all
trades
carpenters
bricklayers
plasterers
painters
and
so
on
were
able
to
keep
almost
regularly
at
work
except
in
wet
weather
the
difference
between
a
good
and
bad
spring
and
summer
is
that
in
good
years
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
make
a
little
overtime
and
the
periods
of
unemployment
are
shorter
and
less
frequent
than
in
bad
years
it
is
rare
even
in
good
years
for
one
of
the
casual
hands
to
be
employed
by
one
firm
for
more
than
one
two
or
three
months
without
a
break
it
is
usual
for
them
to
put
in
a
month
with
one
firm
then
a
fortnight
with
another
then
perhaps
six
weeks
somewhere
else
and
often
between
there
are
two
or
three
days
or
even
weeks
of
enforced
idleness
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
all
through
spring
summer
and
autumn
chapter
the
easter
offering
the
beano
meeting
by
the
beginning
of
april
rushton
were
again
working
nine
hours
a
day
from
seven
in
the
morning
till
at
night
and
after
easter
they
started
working
full
time
from
till
eleven
and
a
half
hours
or
rather
ten
hours
for
they
had
to
lose
half
an
hour
at
breakfast
and
an
hour
at
dinner
just
before
easter
several
of
the
men
asked
hunter
if
they
might
be
allowed
to
work
on
good
friday
and
easter
monday
as
they
said
they
had
had
enough
holidays
during
the
winter
they
had
no
money
to
spare
for
and
they
did
not
wish
to
lose
two
days
pay
when
there
was
work
to
be
done
hunter
told
them
that
there
was
not
sufficient
work
in
to
justify
him
in
doing
as
they
requested
things
were
getting
very
slack
again
and
mr
rushton
had
decided
to
cease
work
from
thursday
night
till
tuesday
morning
they
were
thus
prevented
from
working
on
good
friday
but
it
is
true
that
not
more
than
one
working
man
in
fifty
went
to
any
religious
service
on
that
day
or
on
any
other
day
during
the
easter
festival
on
the
contrary
this
festival
was
the
occasion
of
much
cursing
and
blaspheming
on
the
part
of
those
whose
penniless
condition
it
helped
to
aggravate
by
enforcing
unprofitable
idleness
which
they
lacked
the
means
to
enjoy
during
these
holidays
some
of
the
men
did
little
jobs
on
their
own
account
and
others
put
in
the
whole
time
including
good
friday
and
easter
sunday
gardening
digging
and
planting
their
plots
of
allotment
ground
when
owen
arrived
home
one
evening
during
the
week
before
easter
frankie
gave
him
an
envelope
which
he
had
brought
home
from

it
contained

income
from
various
sources
connected
with
the
church
was
over
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
or
about
twelve
pounds
per
week
but
as
that
sum
was
evidently
insufficient
his
admirers
had
adopted
this
device
for
supplementing
it
frankie
said
all
the
boys
had
one
of
these
letters
and
were
going
to
ask
their
fathers
for
some
money
to
give
towards
the
easter
offering
most
of
them
expected
to
get
twopence
as
the
boy
had
evidently
set
his
heart
on
doing
the
same
as
the
other
children
owen
gave
him
the
twopence
and
they
afterwards
learned
that
the
easter
offering
for
that
year
was
one
hundred
and
pounds
which
was
made
up
of
the
amounts
collected
from
the
parishioners
by
the
children
the
district
visitors
and
the
verger
the
collection
at
a
special
service
and
donations
from
the
old
females
elsewhere
referred
to
by
the
end
of
april
nearly
all
the
old
hands
were
back
at
work
and
several
casual
hands
had
also
been
taken
on
the
being
one
of
the
number
in
addition
to
these
misery
had
taken
on
a
number
of
what
he
called
men
who
were
not
really
skilled
workmen
but
had
picked
up
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
simpler
parts
of
the
trade
to
be
able
to
get
over
it
passably
these
were
paid
fivepence
or
and
were
employed
in
preference
to
those
who
had
served
their
time
because
the
latter
wanted
more
money
and
therefore
were
only
employed
when
absolutely
necessary
besides
the
lightweights
there
were
a
few
young
fellows
called
improvers
who
were
also
employed
because
they
were
cheap
crass
now
acted
as
colourman
having
been
appointed
possibly
because
he
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
laws
of
colour
as
most
of
the
work
consisted
of
small
jobs
all
the
paint
and
distemper
was
mixed
up
at
the
shop
and
sent
out
ready
for
use
to
the
various
jobs
sawkins
or
some
of
the
other
lightweights
generally
carried
the
heavier
lots
of
colour
or
scaffolding
but
the
smaller
lots
of
colour
or
such
things
as
a
pair
of
steps
or
a
painter
plank
were
usually
sent
by
the
boy
whose
slender
legs
had
become
quite
bowed
since
he
had
been
engaged
helping
the
other
philanthropists
to
make
money
for
mr
rushton
crass
work
as
colourman
was
simplified
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
great
number
of
specially
prepared
paints
and
distempers
in
all
colours
supplied
by
the
manufacturers
ready
for
use
most
of
these
concoctions
were
regarded
with
an
eye
of
suspicion
and
dislike
by
the
hands
and
philpot
voiced
the
general
opinion
about
them
one
day
during
a
discussion
when
he
said
they
might
appear
to
be
all
right
for
a
time
but
they
would
probably
not
last
because
they
was
mostly
made
of
kimicles
one
of
these
paints
was
called
liquid
and
was
used
for
decaying
stone
or
plaster
work
it
was
also
supposed
to
be
used
for
thinning
up
a
certain
kind
of
patent
distemper
but
when
misery
found
out
that
it
was
possible
to
thin
the
latter
with
water
the
use
of
liquid
for
that
purpose
was
discontinued
this
liquid
was
a
source
of
much
merriment
to
the
hands
the
name
was
applied
to
the
tea
that
they
made
in
buckets
on
some
of
the
jobs
and
also
to
the
that
was
supplied
by
certain
pubs
one
of
the
new
inventions
was
regarded
with
a
certain
amount
of
indignation
by
the
hands
it
was
a
white
enamel
and
they
objected
to
it
for
two
reasons
one
was
because
as
philpot
remarked
it
dried
so
quickly
that
you
had
to
work
like
greased
lightning
you
had
to
be
all
over
the
door
directly
you
started
it
the
other
reason
was
that
because
it
dried
so
quickly
it
was
necessary
to
keep
closed
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
room
where
it
was
being
used
and
the
smell
was
so
awful
that
it
brought
on
fits
of
dizziness
and
sometimes
vomiting
needless
to
say
the
fact
that
it
compelled
those
who
used
it
to
work
quickly
recommended
the
stuff
to
misery
as
for
the
smell
he
did
not
care
about
that
he
did
not
have
to
inhale
the
fumes
himself
it
was
just
about
this
time
that
crass
after
due
consultation
with
several
of
the
others
including
philpot
harlow
bundy
slyme
easton
and
the
decided
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
hands
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
advisability
of
holding
the
usual
beano
later
on
in
the
summer
the
meeting
was
held
in
the
carpenter
shop
down
at
the
yard
one
evening
at
six
which
allowed
time
for
those
interested
to
attend
after
leaving
work
the
hands
sat
on
the
benches
or
carpenter
stools
or
reclined
upon
heaps
of
shavings
on
a
pair
of
tressels
in
the
centre
of
the
workshop
stood
a
large
oak
coffin
which
crass
had
just
finished
polishing
when
all
those
who
were
expected
to
turn
up
had
arrived
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
the
man
who
made
the
coffins
was
voted
to
the
chair
on
the
proposition
of
crass
seconded
by
philpot
and
then
a
solemn
silence
ensued
which
was
broken
at
last
by
the
chairman
who
in
a
lengthy
speech
explained
the
object
of
the
meeting
possibly
with
a
laudable
desire
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
it
he
took
the
trouble
to
explain
several
times
going
over
the
same
ground
and
repeating
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
whilst
the
audience
waited
in
a
deathlike
and
miserable
silence
for
him
to
leave
off
payne
however
did
not
appear
to
have
any
intention
of
leaving
off
for
he
continued
like
a
man
in
a
trance
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
before
seeming
to
be
under
the
impression
that
he
had
to
make
a
separate
explanation
to
each
individual
member
of
the
audience
at
last
the
crowd
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
began
to
shout
hear
and
to
bang
bits
of
wood
and
hammers
on
the
floor
and
the
benches
and
then
after
a
final
repetition
of
the
statement
that
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
to
consider
the
advisability
of
holding
an
outing
or
beanfeast
the
chairman
collapsed
on
to
a
carpenter
stool
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
crass
then
reminded
the
meeting
that
the
last
year
beano
had
been
an
unqualified
success
and
for
his
part
he
would
be
very
sorry
if
they
did
not
have
one
this
year
last
year
they
had
four
brakes
and
they
went
to
tubberton
village
it
was
true
that
there
was
nothing
much
to
see
at
tubberton
but
there
was
one
thing
they
could
rely
on
getting
there
that
they
could
not
be
sure
of
getting
for
the
same
money
anywhere
else
and
that
was
a
good
feed
applause
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
on
with
the
business
he
would
propose
that
they
decide
to
go
to
tubberton
and
that
a
committee
be
appointed
to
make
arrangements
about
the
dinner
with
the
landlord
of
the
queen
elizabeth
head
at
that
place
philpot
seconded
the
motion
and
payne
was
about
to
call
for
a
show
of
hands
when
harlow
rose
to
a
point
of
order
it
appeared
to
him
that
they
were
getting
on
a
bit
too
fast
the
proper
way
to
do
this
business
was
first
to
take
the
feeling
of
the
meeting
as
to
whether
they
wished
to
have
a
beano
at
all
and
then
if
the
meeting
was
in
favour
of
it
they
could
decide
where
they
were
to
go
and
whether
they
would
have
a
whole
day
or
only
half
a
day
the
said
that
he
did
care
a
dreadful
expression
where
they
went
he
was
willing
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
majority
applause
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
they
had
a
day
or
half
a
day
or
two
days
he
was
agreeable
to
anything
easton
suggested
that
a
special
saloon
carriage
might
be
engaged
and
they
could
go
and
visit
madame
tussaud
waxworks
he
had
never
been
to
that
place
and
had
often
wished
to
see
it
but
philpot
objected
that
if
they
went
there
madame
tussaud
might
be
unwilling
to
let
them
out
again
bundy
endorsed
the
remarks
that
had
fallen
from
crass
with
reference
to
tubberton
he
did
not
care
where
they
went
they
would
never
get
such
a
good
spread
for
the
money
as
they
did
last
year
at
the
queen
elizabeth
cheers
the
chairman
said
that
he
remembered
the
last
beano
very
well
they
had
half
a
day
left
off
work
on
saturday
at
twelve
instead
of
one
so
there
was
only
one
hour
wages
lost
they
went
home
had
a
wash
and
changed
their
clothes
and
got
up
to
the
cricketers
where
the
brakes
was
waiting
at
one
then
they
had
the
two
hours
drive
to
tubberton
stopping
on
the
way
for
drinks
at
the
blue
lion
the
warrior
head
the
bird
in
hand
the
dewdrop
inn
and
the
world
turned
upside
down
applause
they
arrived
at
the
queen
elizabeth
at
and
the
dinner
was
ready
and
it
was
one
of
the
finest
he
had
ever
had
hear
hear
there
was
soup
vegetables
roast
beef
roast
mutton
lamb
and
mint
sauce
plum
duff
yorkshire
and
a
lot
more
the
landlord
of
the
elizabeth
kept
as
good
a
drop
of
beer
as
anyone
could
wish
to
drink
and
as
for
the
teetotallers
they
could
have
tea
coffee
or
ginger
beer
having
thus
made
another
start
payne
found
it
very
difficult
to
leave
off
and
was
proceeding
to
relate
further
details
of
the
last
beano
when
harlow
again
rose
up
from
his
heap
of
shavings
and
said
he
wished
to
call
the
chairman
to
order
hear
hear
what
the
hell
was
the
use
of
all
this
discussion
before
they
had
even
decided
to
have
a
beano
at
all
was
the
meeting
in
favour
of
a
beano
or
not
that
was
the
question
a
prolonged
and
awkward
silence
followed
everyone
was
very
uncomfortable
looking
stolidly
on
the
ground
or
staring
straight
in
front
of
them
at
last
easton
broke
the
silence
by
suggesting
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
plan
if
someone
was
to
make
a
motion
that
a
beano
be
held
this
was
greeted
with
a
general
murmur
of
hear
followed
by
another
awkward
pause
and
then
the
chairman
asked
easton
if
he
would
move
a
resolution
to
that
effect
after
some
hesitation
easton
agreed
and
formally
moved
this
meeting
is
in
favour
of
a
beano
the
said
that
in
order
to
get
on
with
the
business
he
would
second
the
resolution
but
meantime
several
arguments
had
broken
out
between
the
advocates
of
different
places
and
several
men
began
to
relate
anecdotes
of
previous
beanos
nearly
everyone
was
speaking
at
once
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
chairman
was
able
to
put
the
resolution
finding
it
impossible
to
make
his
voice
heard
above
the
uproar
he
began
to
hammer
on
the
bench
with
a
wooden
mallet
and
to
shout
requests
for
order
but
this
only
served
to
increase
the
din
some
of
them
looked
at
him
curiously
and
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
but
the
majority
were
so
interested
in
their
own
arguments
that
they
did
not
notice
him
at
all
whilst
the
chairman
was
trying
to
get
the
attention
of
the
meeting
in
order
to
put
the
question
bundy
had
become
involved
in
an
argument
with
several
of
the
new
hands
who
claimed
to
know
of
an
even
better
place
than
the
queen
elizabeth
a
pub
called
new
found
out
at
mirkfield
a
few
miles
further
on
than
tubberton
and
another
individual
joined
in
the
dispute
alleging
that
a
house
called
three
loggerheads
at
was
the
finest
place
for
a
beano
within
a
hundred
miles
of
mugsborough
he
went
there
last
year
with
pushem
and
driver
crowd
and
they
had
roast
beef
goose
jam
tarts
mince
pies
sardines
blancmange
calves
feet
jelly
and
one
pint
for
each
man
was
included
in
the
cost
of
the
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
discussion
they
noticed
that
most
of
the
others
were
holding
up
their
hands
so
to
show
there
was
no
ill
feeling
they
held
up
theirs
also
and
then
the
chairman
declared
it
was
carried
unanimously
bundy
said
he
would
like
to
ask
the
chairman
to
read
out
the
resolution
which
had
just
been
passed
as
he
had
not
caught
the
words
the
chairman
replied
that
there
was
no
written
resolution
the
motion
was
just
to
express
the
feeling
of
this
meeting
as
to
whether
there
was
to
be
an
outing
or
not
bundy
said
he
was
only
asking
a
civil
question
a
point
of
information
all
he
wanted
to
know
was
what
was
the
terms
of
the
resolution
was
they
in
favour
of
the
beano
or
not
the
chairman
responded
that
the
meeting
was
unanimously
in
favour
applause
harlow
said
that
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
decide
upon
the
date
crass
suggested
the
last
saturday
in
august
that
would
give
them
plenty
of
time
to
pay
in
sawkins
asked
whether
it
was
proposed
to
have
a
day
or
only
half
a
day
he
himself
was
in
favour
of
the
whole
day
it
would
only
mean
losing
a
morning
work
it
was
hardly
worth
going
at
all
if
they
only
had
half
the
day
the
remarked
that
he
had
just
thought
of
a
very
good
place
to
go
if
they
decided
to
have
a
change
three
years
ago
he
was
working
for
dauber
and
botchit
and
they
went
to
first
in
and
the
last
at
bashford
it
was
a
very
small
place
but
there
was
a
field
where
you
could
have
a
game
of
cricket
or
football
and
the
dinner
was
at
lloyds
there
was
also
a
skittle
alley
attached
to
the
pub
and
no
charge
was
made
for
the
use
of
it
there
was
a
bit
of
a
river
there
and
one
of
the
chaps
got
so
drunk
that
he
went
orf
his
onion
and
jumped
into
the
water
and
when
they
got
him
out
the
village
policeman
locked
him
up
and
the
next
day
he
was
took
before
the
beak
and
fined
two
pounds
or
a
month
hard
labour
for
trying
to
commit
suicide
easton
pointed
out
that
there
was
another
way
to
look
at
it
supposing
they
decided
to
have
the
beano
he
supposed
it
would
come
to
about
six
shillings
a
head
if
they
had
it
at
the
end
of
august
and
started
paying
in
now
say
a
tanner
a
week
they
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
make
up
the
amount
but
supposing
the
work
fell
off
and
some
of
them
got
the
push
crass
said
that
in
that
case
a
man
could
either
have
his
money
back
or
he
could
leave
it
and
continue
his
payments
even
if
he
were
working
for
some
other
firm
the
fact
that
he
was
off
from
rushton
would
not
prevent
him
from
going
to
the
beano
harlow
proposed
that
they
decide
to
go
to
the
queen
elizabeth
the
same
as
last
year
and
that
they
have
half
a
day
philpot
said
that
in
order
to
get
on
with
the
business
he
would
second
the
resolution
bundy
suggested
as
an
amendment
that
it
should
be
a
whole
day
starting
from
the
cricketers
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
sawkins
said
that
in
order
to
get
on
with
the
business
he
would
second
the
amendment
one
of
the
new
hands
said
he
wished
to
move
another
amendment
he
proposed
to
strike
out
the
queen
elizabeth
and
substitute
the
three
loggerheads
the
chairman
after
a
pause
inquired
if
there
were
any
seconder
to
this
and
the
said
that
although
he
did
not
care
much
where
they
went
still
to
get
on
with
the
business
he
would
second
the
amendment
although
for
his
own
part
he
would
prefer
to
go
to
the
in
and
last
out
at
bashford
the
new
hand
offered
to
withdraw
his
suggestion
re
the
three
loggerheads
in
favour
of
the
proposition
but
the
latter
said
it
did
matter
it
could
go
as
it
was
as
it
was
getting
rather
late
several
men
went
home
and
cries
of
the
question
began
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
the
chairman
accordingly
was
proceeding
to
put
harlow
proposition
when
the
new
hand
interrupted
him
by
pointing
out
that
it
was
his
duty
as
chairman
to
put
the
amendments
first
this
produced
another
long
discussion
in
the
course
of
which
a
very
tall
thin
man
who
had
a
harsh
metallic
voice
gave
a
long
rambling
lecture
about
the
rules
of
order
and
the
conduct
of
public
meetings
he
spoke
very
slowly
and
deliberately
using
very
long
words
and
dealing
with
the
subject
in
an
exhaustive
manner
a
resolution
was
a
resolution
and
an
amendment
was
an
amendment
then
there
was
what
was
called
an
amendment
to
an
amendment
the
procedure
of
the
house
of
commons
differed
very
materially
from
that
of
the
house
of
lords
and
so
on
this
man
kept
on
talking
for
about
ten
minutes
and
might
have
continued
for
ten
hours
if
he
had
not
been
rudely
interrupted
by
harlow
who
said
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
likely
to
stay
there
all
night
if
they
went
on
like
they
were
going
he
wanted
his
tea
and
he
would
also
like
to
get
a
few
hours
sleep
before
having
to
resume
work
in
the
morning
he
was
getting
about
sick
of
all
this
talk
hear
hear
in
order
to
get
on
with
the
business
he
would
withdraw
his
resolution
if
the
others
would
withdraw
their
amendments
if
they
would
agree
to
do
this
he
would
then
propose
another
resolution
which
if
carried
would
meet
all
the
requirements
of
the
case
applause
the
man
with
the
metallic
voice
observed
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
ask
the
consent
of
those
who
had
moved
amendments
if
the
original
proposition
was
withdrawed
all
the
amendments
fell
to
the
ground
year
observed
crass
we
was
goin
out
of
the
room
after
we
finished
our
dinner
at
the
queen
elizabeth
the
landlord
pointed
to
the
table
and
said
there
enough
left
over
for
you
all
to
another
lot
cheers
harlow
said
that
he
would
move
that
it
be
held
on
the
last
saturday
in
august
that
it
be
for
half
a
day
starting
at
one
so
that
they
could
work
up
till
twelve
which
would
mean
that
they
would
only
have
to
lose
one
hour
pay
that
they
go
to
the
same
place
as
last
year
the
queen
elizabeth

hear
that
the
same
committee
that
acted
last
year
crass
and
bundy
be
appointed
to
make
all
the
arrangements
and
collect
the
subscriptions
applause
the
tall
man
observed
that
this
was
what
was
called
a
compound
resolution
and
was
proceeding
to
explain
further
when
the
chairman
exclaimed
that
it
did
not
matter
a
dam
what
it
was
called
would
anyone
second
it
the
said
that
he
would

for

queen
elizabeth
easton

to
substitute
madame

for
the
queen
elizabeth
he
said
he
moved
this
just
to
test
the
feeling
of
the
meeting
harlow
pointed
out
that
it
would
cost
at
least
a
pound
a
head
to
defray
the
expenses
of
such
a
trip
the
railway

london
meals
for
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
whole
day
and
other
incidental
expenses
to
say
nothing
of
the
loss
of
wages
it
would
not
be
possible
for
any
of
them
to
save
the
necessary
amount
during
the
next
four
months
hear

philpot
repeated
his
warning
as
to
the
danger
of
visiting
madame
tussaud
he
was
certain
that
if
she
once
got
them
in
there
she
would
never
let
them
out
again
he
had
no
desire
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
as
an
image
in
a
museum
one
of
the
new
hands
a
man
with
a
red
tie
said
that
they
would
look
well
after
having
been
soaked
for
a
month
or
two
in
petrifying
liquid
chained
up
in
the
chamber
of

proposed
a
hearty
vote
of
thanks
to
the
chairman
for
the
very
able
manner
in
which
he
had
conducted
the
meeting
when
this
had
been
unanimously
agreed
to
the
moved
a
similar
tribute
of
gratitude
to
crass
for
his
services
to
the
cause
and
the
meeting
dispersed
chapter
june
during
the
early
part
of
may
the
weather
was
exceptionally
bad
with
bitterly
cold
winds
rain
fell
nearly
every
day
covering
the
roads
with
a
slush
that
penetrated
the
rotten
leather
of
the
cheap
or
boots
worn
by
the
workmen
this
weather
had
the
effect
of
stopping
nearly
all
outside
work
and
also
caused
a
lot
of
illness
for
those
who
were
so
fortunate
as
to
have
inside
jobs
frequently
got
wet
through
on
their
way
to
work
in
the
morning
and
had
to
work
all
day
in
damp
clothing
and
with
their
boots
saturated
with
water
it
was
also
a
source
of
trouble
to
those
of
the
men
who
had
allotments
because
if
it
had
been
fine
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
something
to
their
gardens
while
they
were
out
of
work
newman
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
a
job
at
the
trade
since
he
came
out
of
prison
but
he
tried
to
make
a
little
money
by
hawking
bananas
philpot
when
he
was
at
work
used
often
to
buy
a
tanner
or
a
worth
from
him
and
give
them
to
mrs
linden
children
on
saturdays
old
joe
used
to
waylay
these
children
and
buy
them
bags
of
cakes
at
the
bakers
one
week
when
he
knew
that
mrs
linden
had
not
had
much
work
to
do
he
devised
a
very
cunning
scheme
to
help
her
he
had
been
working
with
slyme
who
was
papering
a
large
boarded
ceiling
in
a
shop
it
had
to
be
covered
with
unbleached
calico
before
it
could
be
papered
and
when
the
work
was
done
there
were
a
number
of
narrow
pieces
of
calico
left
over
these
he
collected
and
tore
into
strips
about
six
inches
wide
which
he
took
round
to
mrs
linden
and
asked
her
to
sew
them
together
end
to
end
so
as
to
make
one
long
strip
then
this
long
strip
had
to
be
cut
into
four
pieces
of
equal
length
and
the
edges
sewn
together
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
form
a
long
tube
philpot
told
her
that
it
was
required
for
some
work
that
rushton
were
doing
and
said
he
had
undertaken
to
get
the
sewing
done
the
firm
would
have
to
pay
for
it
so
she
could
charge
a
good
price
see
he
said
with
a
wink
is
one
of
those
jobs
where
we
gets
a
chance
to
get
some
of
our
own
back
mary
thought
it
was
rather
a
strange
sort
of
job
but
she
did
as
philpot
directed
and
when
he
came
for
the
stuff
and
asked
how
much
it
was
she
said
threepence
it
had
only
taken
about
half
an
hour
philpot
ridiculed
this
it
was
not
nearly
enough
they
were
not
supposed
to
know
how
long
it
took
it
ought
to
be
a
bob
at
the
very
least
so
after
some
hesitation
she
made
out
a
bill
for
that
amount
on
a
of
he
brought
her
the
money
the
next
saturday
afternoon
and
went
off
chuckling
to
himself
over
the
success
of
the
scheme
it
did
not
occur
to
him
until
the
next
day
that
he
might
just
as
well
have
got
her
to
make
him
an
apron
or
two
and
when
he
did
think
of
this
he
said
that
after
all
it
did
matter
because
if
he
had
done
that
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
buy
new
calico
and
anyhow
it
could
be
done
some
other
time
newman
did
not
make
his
fortune
out
of
the
bananas
seldom
more
than
two
shillings
a
day
and
consequently
he
was
very
glad
when
philpot
called
at
his
house
one
evening
and
told
him
there
was
a
chance
of
a
job
at
rushton
newman
accordingly
went
to
the
yard
the
next
morning
taking
his
apron
and
blouse
and
his
bag
of
tools
with
him
ready
to
start
work
he
got
there
at
about
quarter
to
six
and
was
waiting
outside
when
hunter
arrived
the
latter
was
secretly
very
glad
to
see
him
for
there
was
a
rush
of
work
in
and
they
were
short
of
men
he
did
not
let
this
appear
of
course
but
hesitated
for
a
few
minutes
when
newman
repeated
the
usual
formula
chance
of
a
job
sir
was
at
all
satisfied
with
you
last
time
you
was
on
you
know
said
misery
i
do
mind
giving
you
another
chance
but
if
you
want
to
hold
your
job
you
have
to
move
yourself
a
bit
quicker
than
you
did
before
towards
the
end
of
the
month
things
began
to
improve
all
round
the
weather
became
finer
and
more
settled
as
time
went
on
the
improvement
was
maintained
and
nearly
everyone
was
employed
rushton
were
so
busy
that
they
took
on
several
other
old
hands
who
had
been
sacked
the
previous
year
for
being
too
slow
thanks
to
the
influence
of
crass
easton
was
now
regarded
as
one
of
the
regular
hands
he
had
recently
resumed
the
practice
of
spending
some
of
his
evenings
at
the
cricketers
it
is
probable
that
even
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
friendship
with
crass
he
would
still
have
continued
to
frequent
the
public
house
for
things
were
not
very
comfortable
at
home
somehow
or
other
ruth
and
he
seemed
to
be
always
quarrelling
and
he
was
satisfied
that
it
was
not
always
his
fault
sometimes
after
the
day
work
was
over
he
would
go
home
resolved
to
be
good
friends
with
her
he
would
plan
on
his
way
homewards
to
suggest
to
her
that
they
should
have
their
tea
and
then
go
out
for
a
walk
with
the
child
once
or
twice
she
agreed
but
on
each
occasion
they
quarrelled
before
they
got
home
again
so
after
a
time
he
gave
up
trying
to
be
friends
with
her
and
went
out
by
himself
every
evening
as
soon
as
he
had
had
his
tea
mary
linden
who
was
still
lodging
with
them
could
not
help
perceiving
their
unhappiness
she
frequently
noticed
that
ruth
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
as
if
with
crying
and
she
gently
sought
to
gain
her
confidence
but
without
success
on
one
occasion
when
mary
was
trying
to
advise
her
ruth
burst
out
into
a
terrible
fit
of
weeping
but
she
would
not
say
what
was
the
cause
except
that
her
head
was
aching
she
was
not
well
that
was
all
sometimes
easton
passed
the
evening
at
the
cricketers
but
frequently
he
went
over
to
the
allotments
where
harlow
had
a
plot
of
ground
harlow
used
to
get
up
about
four
in
the
morning
and
put
in
an
hour
or
so
at
his
garden
before
going
to
work
and
every
evening
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
tea
he
used
to
go
there
again
and
work
till
it
was
dark
sometimes
he
did
not
go
home
to
tea
at
all
but
went
straight
from
work
to
the
garden
and
his
children
used
to
bring
his
tea
to
him
there
in
a
glass
bottle
with
something
to
eat
in
a
little
basket
he
had
four
children
none
of
whom
were
yet
old
enough
to
go
to
work
and
as
may
be
imagined
he
found
it
a
pretty
hard
struggle
to
live
he
was
not
a
teetotaller
but
as
he
often
remarked
the
publicans
got
from
him
would
make
them
very
fat
for
he
often
went
for
weeks
together
without
tasting
the
stuff
except
a
glass
or
two
with
the
sunday
dinner
which
he
did
not
regard
as
an
unnecessary
expense
because
it
was
almost
as
cheap
as
tea
or
coffee
fortunately
his
wife
was
a
good
needlewoman
and
as
sober
and
industrious
as
himself
by
dint
of
slaving
incessantly
from
morning
till
night
she
managed
to
keep
her
home
fairly
comfortable
and
the
children
clean
and
decently
dressed
they
always
looked
respectable
although
they
did
not
always
have
enough
proper
food
to
eat
they
looked
so
respectable
that
none
of
the
ladies
ever
regarded
them
as
deserving
cases
harlow
paid
fifteen
shillings
a
year
for
his
plot
of
ground
and
although
it
meant
a
lot
of
hard
work
it
was
also
a
source
of
pleasure
and
some
profit
he
generally
made
a
few
shillings
out
of
the
flowers
besides
having
enough
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
to
last
them
nearly
all
the
year
sometimes
easton
went
over
to
the
allotments
and
lent
harlow
a
hand
with
this
gardening
work
but
whether
he
went
there
or
to
the
cricketers
he
usually
returned
home
about
half
past
nine
and
then
went
straight
to
bed
often
without
speaking
a
single
word
to
ruth
who
for
her
part
seldom
spoke
to
him
except
to
answer
something
he
said
or
to
ask
some
necessary
question
at
first
easton
used
to
think
that
it
was
all
because
of
the
way
he
had
behaved
to
her
in
the
public
house
but
when
he
apologized
as
he
did
several
times
and
begged
her
to
forgive
him
and
forget
about
it
she
always
said
it
was
all
right
there
was
nothing
to
forgive
then
after
a
time
he
began
to
think
it
was
on
account
of
their
poverty
and
the
loss
of
their
home
for
nearly
all
their
furniture
had
been
sold
during
the
last
winter
but
whenever
he
talked
of
trying
to
buy
some
more
things
to
make
the
place
comfortable
again
she
did
not
appear
to
take
any
interest
the
house
was
neat
enough
as
it
was
they
could
manage
very
well
she
said
indifferently
one
evening
about
the
middle
of
june
when
he
had
been
over
to
the
allotments
easton
brought
her
home
a
bunch
of
flowers
that
harlow
had
given
him
some
red
and
white
roses
and
some
pansies
when
he
came
in
ruth
was
packing
his
food
basket
for
the
next
day
the
baby
was
asleep
in
its
cot
on
the
floor
near
the
window
although
it
was
nearly
nine
the
lamp
had
not
yet
been
lighted
and
the
mournful
twilight
that
entered
the
room
through
the
open
window
increased
the
desolation
of
its
appearance
the
fire
had
burnt
itself
out
and
the
grate
was
filled
with
ashes
on
the
hearth
was
an
old
rug
made
of
jute
that
had
once
been
printed
in
bright
colours
which
had
faded
away
till
the
whole
surface
had
become
almost
uniformly
drab
showing
scarcely
any
trace
of
the
original
pattern
the
rest
of
the
floor
was
bare
except
for
two
or
three
small
pieces
of
old
carpet
that
ruth
had
bought
for
a
few
pence
at
different
times
at
some
inferior
shop
the
chairs
and
the
table
were
almost
the
only
things
that
were
left
of
the
original
furniture
of
the
room
and
except
for
three
or
four
plates
of
different
patterns
and
sizes
and
a
few
cups
and
saucers
the
shelves
of
the
dresser
were
bare
the
stillness
of
the
atmosphere
was
disturbed
only
by
the
occasional
sound
of
the
wheels
of
a
passing
vehicle
and
the
strangely
distinct
voices
of
some
children
who
were
playing
in
the
street
brought
you
these
said
easton
offering
her
the
flowers
thought
you
like
them
i
got
them
from
harlow
you
know
i
been
helping
him
a
little
with
his
garden
at
first
he
thought
she
did
not
want
to
take
them
she
was
standing
at
the
table
with
her
back
to
the
window
so
that
he
was
unable
to
see
the
expression
of
her
face
and
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
she
faltered
out
some
words
of
thanks
and
took
the
flowers
which
she
put
down
on
the
table
almost
as
soon
as
she
touched
them
offended
at
what
he
considered
her
contemptuous
indifference
easton
made
no
further
attempt
at
conversation
but
went
into
the
scullery
to
wash
his
hands
and
then
went
up
to
bed
downstairs
for
a
long
time
after
he
was
gone
ruth
sat
alone
by
the
fireless
grate
in
the
silence
and
the
gathering
shadows
holding
the
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
hand
living
over
again
the
events
of
the
last
year
and
consumed
with
an
agony
of
remorse
the
presence
of
mary
linden
and
the
two
children
in
the
house
probably
saved
ruth
from
being
more
unhappy
than
she
was
little
elsie
had
made
an
arrangement
with
her
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
baby
out
for
walks
and
in
return
ruth
did
elsie
housework
as
for
mary
she
had
not
much
time
to
do
anything
but
sew
almost
the
only
relaxation
she
knew
being
when
she
took
the
work
home
and
on
sunday
which
she
usually
devoted
to
a
general
of
the
room
and
to
mending
the
children
clothes
sometimes
on
sunday
evening
she
used
to
go
with
ruth
and
the
children
to
see
mrs
owen
who
although
she
was
not
ill
enough
to
stay
in
bed
seldom
went
out
of
the
house
she
had
never
really
recovered
from
the
attack
of
illness
which
was
brought
on
by
her
work
at
the
boarding
house
the
doctor
had
been
to
see
her
once
or
twice
and
had
prescribed
rest
she
was
to
lie
down
as
much
as
possible
not
to
do
any
heavy
work
not
to
carry
or
lift
any
heavy
articles
scrub
floors
make
beds
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
she
was
to
take
plenty
of
nourishing
food
beef
tea
chicken
a
little
wine
and
so
on
he
did
not
suggest
a
trip
round
the
world
in
a
steam
yacht
or
a
visit
to
switzerland
perhaps
he
thought
they
might
not
be
able
to
afford
it
sometimes
she
was
so
ill
that
she
had
to
observe
one
at
least
of
the
doctor
instructions
to
lie
down
and
then
she
would
worry
and
fret
because
she
was
not
able
to
do
the
housework
and
because
owen
had
to
prepare
his
own
tea
when
he
came
home
at
night
on
one
of
these
occasions
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
owen
to
stay
at
home
from
work
if
it
had
not
been
for
mrs
easton
who
came
for
several
days
in
succession
to
look
after
her
and
attend
to
the
house
fortunately
owen
health
was
better
since
the
weather
had
become
warmer
for
a
long
time
after
the
attack
of
haemorrhage
he
had
while
writing
the
he
used
to
dread
going
to
sleep
at
night
for
fear
it
should
recur
he
had
heard
of
people
dying
in
their
sleep
from
that
cause
but
this
terror
gradually
left
him
nora
knew
nothing
of
what
occurred
that
night
to
have
told
her
would
have
done
no
good
but
on
the
contrary
would
have
caused
her
a
lot
of
useless
anxiety
sometimes
he
doubted
whether
it
was
right
not
to
tell
her
but
as
time
went
by
and
his
health
continued
to
improve
he
was
glad
he
had
said
nothing
about
it
frankie
had
lately
resumed
his
athletic
exercises
with
the
flat
iron
his
strength
was
returning
since
owen
had
been
working
regularly
because
he
had
been
having
his
porridge
and
milk
again
and
also
some
parrish
food
which
a
chemist
at
windley
was
selling
large
bottles
of
for
a
shilling
he
used
to
have
what
he
called
a
two
or
three
times
a
week
with
elsie
charley
and
easton
baby
as
the
guests
sometimes
if
mrs
owen
were
not
well
elsie
used
to
stay
in
with
her
after
tea
and
do
some
housework
while
the
boys
went
out
to
play
but
more
frequently
the
four
children
used
to
go
together
to
the
park
to
play
or
sail
boats
on
the
lake
once
one
of
the
boats
was
becalmed
about
a
couple
of
yards
from
shore
and
while
trying
to
reach
it
with
a
stick
frankie
fell
into
the
water
and
when
charley
tried
to
drag
him
out
he
fell
in
also
elsie
put
the
baby
down
on
the
bank
and
seized
hold
of
charley
and
while
she
was
trying
to
get
him
out
the
baby
began
rolling
down
and
would
probably
have
tumbled
in
as
well
if
a
man
who
happened
to
be
passing
by
had
not
rushed
up
in
time
to
prevent
it
fortunately
the
water
at
that
place
was
only
about
two
feet
deep
so
the
boys
were
not
much
the
worse
for
their
ducking
they
returned
home
wet
through
smothered
with
mud
and
feeling
very
important
like
boys
who
had
distinguished
themselves
after
this
whenever
she
could
manage
to
spare
the
time
ruth
easton
used
to
go
with
the
children
to
the
park
there
was
a
kind
of
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
only
a
few
feet
away
from
the
water
edge
surrounded
and
shaded
by
trees
whose
branches
arched
over
the
path
and
drooped
down
to
the
surface
of
the
water
while
the
children
played
ruth
used
to
sit
in
this
arbour
and
sew
but
often
her
work
was
neglected
and
forgotten
as
she
gazed
pensively
at
the
water
which
just
there
looked
very
still
and
dark
and
deep
for
it
was
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
by
the
trees
that
lined
the
banks
at
the
end
of
the
lake
sometimes
if
it
happened
to
be
raining
instead
of
going
out
the
children
used
to
have
some
games
in
the
house
on
one
such
occasion
frankie
produced
the
flat
iron
and
went
through
the
exercise
and
charley
had
a
go
as
well
but
although
he
was
slightly
older
and
taller
than
frankie
he
could
not
lift
the
iron
so
often
or
hold
it
out
so
long
as
the
other
a
failure
that
frankie
attributed
to
the
fact
that
charley
had
too
much
tea
and
bread
and
butter
instead
of
porridge
and
milk
and
parrish
food
charley
was
so
upset
about
his
lack
of
strength
that
he
arranged
with
frankie
to
come
home
with
him
the
next
day
after
school
to
see
his
mother
about
it
mrs
linden
had
a
flat
iron
so
they
gave
a
demonstration
of
their
respective
powers
before
her
mrs
easton
being
also
present
by
request
because
frankie
said
that
the
diet
in
question
was
suitable
for
babies
as
well
as
big
children
he
had
been
brought
up
on
it
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
it
was
almost
as
cheap
as
bread
and
butter
and
tea
the
result
of
the
exhibition
was
that
mrs
linden
promised
to
make
porridge
for
charley
and
elsie
whenever
she
could
spare
the
time
and
mrs
easton
said
she
would
try
it
for
the
baby
also
chapter
the
good
old
all
through
the
summer
the
crowd
of
philanthropists
continued
to
toil
and
sweat
at
their
noble
and
unselfish
task
of
making
money
for
mr
rushton
painting
the
outsides
of
houses
and
shops
washing
off
and
distempering
ceilings
stripping
old
paper
off
walls
painting
and
papering
rooms
and
staircases
building
new
rooms
or
other
additions
to
old
houses
or
business
premises
digging
up
old
drains
repairing
leaky
roofs
and
broken
windows
their
zeal
and
enthusiasm
in
the
good
cause
was
unbounded
they
were
supposed
to
start
work
at
six
but
most
of
them
were
usually
to
be
found
waiting
outside
the
job
at
about
a
quarter
to
that
hour
sitting
on
the
kerbstones
or
the
doorstep
their
operations
extended
all
over
the
town
at
all
hours
of
the
day
they
were
to
be
seen
either
going
or
returning
from
carrying
ladders
planks
pots
of
paint
pails
of
whitewash
earthenware
chimney
pots
drainpipes
lengths
of
guttering
closet
pans
grates
bundles
of
wallpaper
buckets
of
paste
sacks
of
cement
and
loads
of
bricks
and
mortar
quite
a
common
spectacle
for
gods
and
men
was
a
procession
consisting
of
a
handcart
loaded
up
with
such
materials
being
pushed
or
dragged
through
the
public
streets
by
about
half
a
dozen
of
these
imperialists
in
broken
boots
and
with
battered
stained
discoloured
bowler
hats
or
caps
splashed
with
paint
and
whitewash
their
collars
dirty
limp
and
crumpled
and
their
rotten
misfit
clothing
saturated
with
sweat
and
plastered
with
mortar
even
the
assistants
in
the
grocers
and
drapers
shops
laughed
and
ridiculed
and
pointed
the
finger
of
scorn
at
them
as
they
passed
the
superior
classes
those
who
do
nothing
regarded
them
as
a
sort
of
lower
animals
a
letter
appeared
in
the
obscurer
one
week
from
one
of
these
loafers
complaining
of
the
annoyance
caused
to
the
visitors
by
workmen
walking
on
the
pavement
as
they
passed
along
the
grand
parade
in
the
evening
on
their
way
home
from
work
and
suggesting
that
they
should
walk
in
the
roadway
when
they
heard
of
the
letter
a
lot
of
the
workmen
adopted
the
suggestion
and
walked
in
the
road
so
as
to
avoid
contaminating
the
idlers
this
letter
was
followed
by
others
of
a
somewhat
similar
kind
and
one
or
two
written
in
a
patronizing
strain
in
defence
of
the
working
classes
by
persons
who
evidently
knew
nothing
about
them
there
was
also
a
letter
from
an
individual
who
signed
himself
complaining
that
he
was
often
awakened
out
of
his
beauty
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
the
clattering
noise
of
the
workmen
boots
as
they
passed
his
house
on
their
way
to
work
in
the
morning
wrote
that
not
only
did
they
make
a
dreadful
noise
with
their
horrible
boots
but
they
were
in
the
habit
of
coughing
and
spitting
a
great
deal
which
was
very
unpleasant
to
hear
and
they
conversed
in
loud
tones
sometimes
their
conversation
was
not
at
all
edifying
for
it
consisted
largely
of
bad
language
which
assumed
to
be
attributable
to
the
fact
that
they
were
out
of
temper
because
they
had
to
rise
so
early
as
a
rule
they
worked
till
five
in
the
evening
and
by
the
time
they
reached
home
it
was
six
when
they
had
taken
their
evening
meal
and
had
a
wash
it
was
nearly
eight
about
nine
most
of
them
went
to
bed
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
up
about
half
past
four
the
next
morning
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
before
leaving
home
at
half
past
five
to
go
to
work
again
frequently
it
happened
that
they
had
to
leave
home
earlier
than
this
because
their
was
more
than
half
an
hour
walk
away
it
did
not
matter
how
far
away
the
was
from
the
shop
the
men
had
to
walk
to
and
fro
in
their
own
time
for
trades
union
rules
were
a
dead
letter
in
mugsborough
there
were
no
tram
fares
or
train
fares
or
walking
time
allowed
for
the
likes
of
them
out
of
every
hundred
of
them
did
not
believe
in
such
things
as
those
they
had
much
more
sense
than
to
join
trades
unions
on
the
contrary
they
believed
in
placing
themselves
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
their
good
kind
liberal
and
tory
masters
very
frequently
it
happened
when
only
a
few
men
were
working
together
that
it
was
not
convenient
to
make
tea
for
breakfast
or
dinner
and
then
some
of
them
brought
tea
with
them
ready
made
in
bottles
and
drank
it
cold
but
most
of
them
went
to
the
nearest
pub
and
ate
their
food
there
with
a
glass
of
beer
even
those
who
would
rather
have
had
tea
or
coffee
had
beer
because
if
they
went
to
a
temperance
restaurant
or
coffee
tavern
it
generally
happened
that
they
were
not
treated
very
civilly
unless
they
bought
something
to
eat
as
well
as
to
drink
and
the
tea
at
such
places
was
really
dearer
than
beer
and
the
latter
was
certainly
quite
as
good
to
drink
as
the
stewed
tea
or
the
liquid
mud
that
was
sold
as
coffee
at
cheap
eating
houses
there
were
some
who
were
as
they
thought
exceptionally
lucky
the
firms
they
worked
for
were
busy
enough
to
let
them
work
two
overtime
every
night
till
half
past
seven
without
stopping
for
tea
most
of
these
arrived
home
about
eight
completely
flattened
out
then
they
had
some
tea
and
a
wash
and
before
they
knew
where
they
were
it
was
about
half
past
nine
then
they
went
to
sleep
again
till
half
past
four
or
five
the
next
morning
they
were
usually
so
tired
when
they
got
home
at
night
that
they
never
had
any
inclination
for
study
or
any
kind
of
even
if
they
had
had
the
time
they
had
plenty
of
time
to
study
during
the
winter
and
their
favourite
subject
then
was
how
to
preserve
themselves
from
starving
to
death
this
overtime
however
was
the
exception
for
although
in
former
years
it
had
been
the
almost
invariable
rule
to
work
till
half
past
seven
in
summer
most
of
the
firms
now
made
a
practice
of
ceasing
work
at
the
revolution
which
had
taken
place
in
this
matter
was
a
favourite
topic
of
conversation
amongst
the
men
who
spoke
regretfully
of
the
glorious
past
when
things
were
busy
and
they
used
to
work
fifteen
sixteen
and
even
eighteen
hours
a
day
but
nowadays
there
were
nearly
as
many
chaps
out
of
work
in
the
summer
as
in
the
winter
they
used
to
discuss
the
causes
of
the
change
one
was
of
course
the
fact
that
there
was
not
so
much
building
going
on
as
formerly
and
another
was
the
speeding
up
and
and
the
manner
in
which
the
work
was
now
done
or
rather
scamped
as
old
philpot
said
he
could
remember
the
time
when
he
was
a
nipper
when
such
a
as
that
at
cave
would
have
lasted
at
least
six
months
and
they
would
have
had
more
hands
on
it
too
but
it
would
have
been
done
properly
not
messed
up
like
that
was
all
the
woodwork
would
have
been
rubbed
down
with
pumice
stone
and
water
all
the
knots
cut
out
and
the
holes
properly
filled
up
and
the
work
properly
rubbed
down
with
between
every
coat
but
nowadays
the
only
place
you
see
a
bit
of
pumice
stone
was
in
a
glass
case
in
a
museum
with
a
label
on
it
stone
formerly
used
by
most
of
them
spoke
of
those
bygone
times
with
poignant
regret
but
there
were
a
few
generally
fellows
who
had
been
contaminated
by
contact
with
socialists
or
whose
characters
had
been
warped
and
degraded
by
the
perusal
of
socialist
literature
who
said
that
they
did
not
desire
to
work
overtime
at
all
ten
hours
a
day
were
quite
enough
for
them
in
fact
they
would
rather
do
only
eight
what
they
wanted
they
said
was
not
more
work
but
more
grub
more
clothes
more
leisure
more
pleasure
and
better
homes
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
go
for
country
walks
or
bicycle
rides
to
go
out
fishing
or
to
go
to
the
seaside
and
bathe
and
lie
on
the
beach
and
so
forth
but
these
were
only
a
very
few
there
were
not
many
so
selfish
as
this
the
majority
desired
nothing
but
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
as
for
their
children
why
was
good
enough
for
themselves
oughter
be
good
enough
for
the
kids
they
often
said
that
such
things
as
leisure
culture
pleasure
and
the
benefits
of
civilization
were
never
intended
for
likes
of
us
they
did
not
all
actually
say
this
but
that
was
what
their
conduct
amounted
to
for
they
not
only
refused
to
help
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
things
for
their
children
but
they
ridiculed
and
opposed
and
cursed
and
abused
those
who
were
trying
to
do
it
for
them
the
foulest
words
that
came
out
of
their
mouths
were
directed
against
the
men
of
their
own
class
in
the
house
of
commons
the
labour
members
and
especially
the
socialists
whom
they
spoke
of
as
fellows
who
were
too
bloody
lazy
to
work
for
a
living
and
who
wanted
the
working
classes
to
keep
them
some
of
them
said
that
they
did
not
believe
in
helping
their
children
to
become
anything
better
than
their
parents
had
been
because
in
such
cases
the
children
when
they
grew
up
down
upon
and
were
ashamed
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
they
seemed
to
think
that
if
they
loved
and
did
their
duty
to
their
children
the
probability
was
that
the
children
would
prove
ungrateful
as
if
even
if
that
were
true
it
would
be
any
excuse
for
their
indifference
another
cause
of
the
shortage
of
work
was
the
intrusion
into
the
trade
of
so
many
outsiders
fellows
like
sawkins
and
the
other
lightweights
whatever
other
causes
there
were
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
hurrying
and
scamping
was
a
very
real
one
every
had
to
be
done
at
once
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
life
or
death
it
must
be
finished
by
a
certain
time
if
the
was
at
an
empty
house
misery
yarn
was
that
it
was
let
the
people
were
coming
in
at
the
end
of
the
week
therefore
everything
must
be
finished
by
wednesday
night
all
the
ceilings
had
to
be
washed
off
the
walls
stripped
and
repapered
and
two
coats
of
paint
inside
and
outside
the
house
new
drains
were
to
be
put
in
and
all
broken
windows
and
locks
and
broken
plaster
repaired
a
number
of
men
usually
about
half
as
many
as
there
should
have
been
would
be
sent
to
do
the
work
and
one
man
was
put
in
charge
of
the
these
or
knew
that
if
they
their
jobs
pay
they
would
be
put
in
charge
of
others
and
be
kept
on
in
preference
to
other
men
as
long
as
the
firm
had
any
work
so
they
helped
misery
to
scheme
and
scamp
the
work
and
watched
and
drove
the
men
under
their
charge
and
these
latter
poor
wretches
knowing
that
their
only
chance
of
retaining
their
employment
was
to
into
it
tore
into
it
like
so
many
maniacs
instead
of
cleaning
any
parts
of
the
woodwork
that
were
greasy
or
very
dirty
they
brushed
them
over
with
a
coat
of
spirit
varnish
before
painting
to
make
sure
that
the
paint
would
dry
places
where
the
plaster
of
the
walls
was
damaged
were
repaired
with
what
was
humorously
called
cement
which
was
the
technical
term
for
dirt
out
of
the
garden
and
the
surface
was
skimmed
over
with
proper
material
ceilings
that
were
not
very
dirty
were
not
washed
off
but
dusted
and
lightly
gone
over
with
a
thin
coat
of
whitewash
the
old
paper
was
often
left
upon
the
walls
of
rooms
that
were
supposed
to
be
stripped
before
being
repapered
and
to
conceal
this
the
joints
of
the
old
paper
were
rubbed
down
so
that
they
should
not
be
perceptible
through
the
new
paper
as
far
as
possible
misery
and
the
avoided
doing
the
work
the
customers
paid
for
and
even
what
little
they
did
was
hurried
over
anyhow
a
reign
of
terror
the
terror
of
the
sack
prevailed
on
all
the
which
were
carried
on
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
series
of
alarums
and
excursions
no
man
felt
safe
for
a
moment
at
the
most
unexpected
times
misery
would
arrive
and
rush
like
a
whirlwind
all
over
the
if
he
happened
to
find
a
man
having
a
spell
the
culprit
was
immediately
discharged
but
he
did
not
get
the
opportunity
of
doing
this
very
often
for
everybody
was
too
terrified
to
leave
off
working
even
for
a
few
minutes
rest
from
the
moment
of
hunter
arrival
until
his
departure
a
state
of
panic
hurry
scurry
and
turmoil
reigned
his
strident
voice
rang
through
the
house
as
he
bellowed
out
to
them
to
themselves
get
it
done
smear
it
on
anyhow
tar
it
over
we
got
another
job
to
start
when
you
done
this
occasionally
just
to
keep
the
others
up
to
concert
pitch
he
used
to
sack
one
of
the
men
for
being
too
slow
they
all
trembled
before
him
and
ran
about
whenever
he
spoke
to
or
called
them
because
they
knew
that
there
were
always
a
lot
of
other
men
out
of
work
who
would
be
willing
and
eager
to
fill
their
places
if
they
got
the
sack
although
it
was
now
summer
and
the
distress
committee
and
all
the
other
committees
had
suspended
operations
there
was
still
always
a
large
number
of
men
hanging
about
the
vicinity
of
the
fountain
on
the
parade
the
wage
slave
market
when
men
finished
up
for
the
firm
they
were
working
for
they
usually
made
for
that
place
any
master
in
want
of
a
wage
slave
for
a
few
hours
days
or
weeks
could
always
buy
one
there
the
men
knew
this
and
they
also
knew
that
if
they
got
the
sack
from
one
firm
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
another
job
and
that
was
why
they
were
terrified
when
misery
was
gone
to
repeat
the
same
performance
at
some
other
job
the
would
have
a
crawl
round
to
see
how
the
chaps
were
getting
on
to
find
out
if
they
had
used
up
all
their
paint
yet
or
to
bring
them
some
putty
so
that
they
should
not
have
to
leave
their
work
to
go
to
get
anything
themselves
and
then
very
often
rushton
himself
would
come
and
stalk
quietly
about
the
house
or
stand
silently
behind
the
men
watching
them
as
they
worked
he
seldom
spoke
to
anyone
but
just
stood
there
like
a
graven
image
or
walked
about
like
a
dumb
animal
a
pig
as
the
men
used
to
say
this
individual
had
a
very
exalted
idea
of
his
own
importance
and
dignity
one
man
got
the
sack
for
presuming
to
stop
him
in
the
street
to
ask
some
questions
about
some
work
that
was
being
done
misery
went
round
to
all
the
jobs
the
next
day
and
told
all
the
to
tell
all
the
hands
that
they
were
never
to
speak
to
mr
rushton
if
they
met
him
in
the
street
and
the
following
saturday
the
man
who
had
so
offended
was
given
his
back
day
ostensibly
because
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
really
for
the
reason
stated
above
there
was
one
job
the
outside
of
a
large
house
that
stood
on
elevated
ground
overlooking
the
town
the
men
who
were
working
there
were
even
more
than
usually
uncomfortable
for
it
was
said
that
rushton
used
to
sit
in
his
office
and
watch
them
through
a
telescope
sometimes
when
it
was
really
necessary
to
get
a
job
done
by
a
certain
time
they
had
to
work
late
perhaps
till
eight
or
nine
no
time
was
allowed
for
tea
but
some
of
them
brought
sufficient
food
with
them
in
the
morning
to
enable
them
to
have
a
little
about
six
in
the
evening
others
arranged
for
their
children
to
bring
them
some
tea
from
home
as
a
rule
they
partook
of
this
without
stopping
work
they
had
it
on
the
floor
beside
them
and
ate
and
drank
and
worked
at
the
same
time
a
of
white
lead
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
margarine
in
the
other
on
some
jobs
if
the
happened
to
be
a
decent
sort
they
posted
a
sentry
to
look
out
for
hunter
or
rushton
while
the
others
knocked
off
for
a
few
minutes
to
snatch
a
mouthful
of
grub
but
it
was
not
safe
always
to
do
this
for
there
was
often
some
crawling
sneak
with
an
ambition
to
become
a
who
would
not
scruple
to
curry
favour
with
misery
by
reporting
the
crime
as
an
additional
precaution
against
the
possibility
of
any
of
the
men
idling
or
wasting
their
time
each
one
was
given
a
on
which
he
was
required
to
account
for
every
minute
of

the

were
scrutinized
and
every
now
and
then
a
man
would
be
up
on
the
carpet
in
the
office
before
rushton
and
misery
and
interrogated
as
to
why
he
had
taken
fifteen
hours
to
do
ten
hours
work
in
the
event
of
the
accused
being
unable
to
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
his
conduct
he
was
usually
sacked
on
the
spot
misery
was
frequently
called
on
the
carpet
himself
if
he
made
a
mistake
in
figuring
out
a
and
gave
in
too
high
a
tender
for
it
so
that
the
firm
did
not
get
the
work
rushton
grumbled
if
the
price
was
so
low
that
there
was
not
enough
profit
rushton
was
very
unpleasant
about
it
and
whenever
it
happened
that
there
was
not
only
no
profit
but
an
actual
loss
rushton
created
such
a
terrible
disturbance
that
misery
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
and
used
to
get
on
his
bicycle
and
rush
off
to
the
nearest
and
howl
and
bellow
at
the
to
get
it
done
all
the
time
the
capabilities
of
the
men
especially
with
regard
to
speed
were
carefully
watched
and
noted
and
whenever
there
was
a
slackness
of
work
and
it
was
necessary
to
discharge
some
hands
those
that
were
slow
or
took
too
much
pains
were
weeded
out
this
of
course
was
known
to
the
men
and
it
had
the
desired
effect
upon
them
in
justice
to
rushton
and
hunter
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
excuse
for
all
this
driving
and
cheating
because
they
had
to
compete
with
all
the
other
firms
who
conducted
their
business
in
precisely
the
same
way
it
was
not
their
fault
but
the
fault
of
the
system
a
dozen
firms
tendered
for
every
and
of
course
the
lowest
tender
usually
obtained
the
work
knowing
this
they
all
cut
the
price
down
to
the
lowest
possible
figure
and
the
workmen
had
to
suffer
the
trouble
was
that
there
were
too
many
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
the
workmen
if
nine
out
of
every
ten
of
the
employers
had
never
started
business
then
the
others
would
have
been
able
to
get
a
better
price
for
their
work
and
the
men
might
have
had
better
wages
and
conditions
the
hands
however
made
no
such
allowances
or
excuses
as
these
for
misery
and
rushton
they
never
thought
or
spoke
of
them
except
with
hatred
and
curses
but
whenever
either
of
them
came
to
the
the
cringed
and
grovelled
before
them
greeting
them
with
disgustingly
servile
salutations
plentifully
interspersed
with
the
word
greetings
which
were
frequently
either
ignored
altogether
or
answered
with
an
inarticulate
grunt
they
said
at
nearly
every
second
word
it
made
one
feel
sick
to
hear
them
because
it
was
not
courtesy
they
were
never
courteous
to
each
other
it
was
simply
abject
servility
and
one
of
the
results
of
all
the
frenzied
hurrying
was
that
every
now
and
then
there
was
an
accident
somebody
got
hurt
and
it
was
strange
that
accidents
were
not
more
frequent
considering
the
risks
that
were
taken
when
they
happened
to
be
working
on
ladders
in
busy
streets
they
were
not
often
allowed
to
have
anyone
to
stand
at
the
foot
and
the
consequence
was
that
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
came
into
violent
collision
with
the
bottoms
of
the
ladders
small
boys
playing
in
the
reckless
manner
characteristic
of
their
years
rushed
up
against
them
errand
boys
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
penny
instalments
of
the
adventures
of
claude
duval
and
carrying
large
baskets
of
wandered
into
them
blind
men
fell
foul
of
them
adventurous
schoolboys
climbed
up
them
people
with
large
feet
became
entangled
in
them
fat
persons
of
both
sexes
who
thought
it
unlucky
to
walk
underneath
tried
to
negotiate
the
narrow
strip
of
pavement
between
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
the
kerb
and
in
their
passage
knocked
up
against
the
ladder
and
sometimes
fell
into
the
road
nursemaids
wheeling
perambulators
lolling
over
the
handle
which
they
usually
held
with
their
left
hands
the
right
holding
a
copy
of
orange
blossoms
or
some
halfpenny
paper
and
so
interested
in
the
story
of
the
marquis
of
lymejuice
a
young
man
of
noble
presence
and
fabulous
wealth
with
a
drooping
golden
moustache
and
very
long
legs
who
notwithstanding
the
diabolical
machinations
of
lady
sibyl
malvoise
who
loves
him
as
well
as
a
woman
with
a
name
like
that
is
capable
of
loving
anyone
is
determined
to
wed
none
other
than
the
at
the
village
inn
inevitably
bashed
the
perambulators
into
the
ladders
even
when
the
girls
were
not
reading
they
nearly
always
ran
into
the
ladders
which
seemed
to
possess
a
magnetic
attraction
for
perambulators
and
of
all
kinds
whether
propelled
by
nurses
or
mothers
sometimes
they
would
advance
very
cautiously
towards
the
ladder
then
when
they
got
very
near
hesitate
a
little
whether
to
go
under
or
run
the
risk
of
falling
into
the
street
by
essaying
the
narrow
passage
then
they
would
get
very
close
up
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
dodge
and
dance
about
and
give
the
cart
little
pushes
from
side
to
side
until
at
last
the
magnetic
influence
exerted
itself
and
the
perambulator
crashed
into
the
ladder
perhaps
at
the
very
moment
that
the
man
at
the
top
was
stretching
out
to
do
some
part
of
the
work
almost
beyond
his
reach
once
harlow
had
just
started
painting
some
rainpipes
from
the
top
of
a
ladder
when
one
of
several
small
boys
who
were
playing
in
the
street
ran
violently
against
the
foot
harlow
was
so
startled
that
he
dropped
his
brushes
and
clutched
wildly
at
the
ladder
which
turned
completely
round
and
slid
about
six
feet
along
the
parapet
into
the
angle
of
the
wall
with
harlow
hanging
beneath
by
his
hands
the
paint
pot
was
hanging
by
a
hook
from
one
of
the
rungs
and
the
jerk
scattered
the
brown
paint
it
contained
all
over
harlow
and
all
over
the
brickwork
of
the
front
of
the
house
he
managed
to
descend
safely
by
clasping
his
legs
round
the
sides
of
the
ladder
and
sliding
down
when
misery
came
there
was
a
row
about
what
he
called
carelessness
and
the
next
day
harlow
had
to
wear
his
sunday
trousers
to
work
on
another
occasion
they
were
painting
the
outside
of
a
house
called
lodge
at
one
corner
it
had
a
tower
surmounted
by
a
spire
or
steeple
and
this
steeple
terminated
with
an
ornamental
pinnacle
which
had
to
be
painted
the
ladder
they
had
was
not
quite
long
enough
and
besides
that
as
it
had
to
stand
in
a
sort
of
a
courtyard
at
the
base
of
the
tower
it
was
impossible
to
slant
it
sufficiently
instead
of
lying
along
the
roof
of
the
steeple
it
was
sticking
up
in
the
air
when
easton
went
up
to
paint
the
pinnacle
he
had
to
stand
on
almost
the
very
top
rung
of
the
ladder
to
be
exact
the
third
from
the
top
and
lean
over
to
steady
himself
by
holding
on
to
the
pinnacle
with
his
left
hand
while
he
used
the
brush
with
his
right
as
it
was
only
about
twenty
minutes
work
there
were
two
men
to
hold
the
foot
of
the
ladder
it
was
cheaper
to
do
it
this
way
than
to
rig
up
a
proper
scaffold
which
would
have
entailed
perhaps
two
hours
work
for
two
or
three
men
of
course
it
was
very
dangerous
but
that
did
not
matter
at
all
because
even
if
the
man
fell
it
would
make
no
difference
to
the
firm
all
the
men
were
insured
and
somehow
or
other
although
they
frequently
had
narrow
escapes
they
did
not
often
come
to
grief
on
this
occasion
just
as
easton
was
finishing
he
felt
the
pinnacle
that
he
was
holding
on
to
give
way
and
he
got
such
a
fright
that
his
heart
nearly
stopped
beating
he
let
go
his
hold
and
steadied
himself
on
the
ladder
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
when
he
had
descended
three
or
four
steps
into
comparative
safety
he
remained
clinging
convulsively
to
the
ladder
and
feeling
so
limp
that
he
was
unable
to
go
down
any
further
for
several
minutes
when
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
and
the
others
noticed
how
white
and
trembling
he
was
he
told
them
about
the
pinnacle
being
loose
and
the
coming
along
just
then
they
told
him
about
it
and
suggested
that
it
should
be
repaired
as
otherwise
it
might
fall
down
and
hurt
someone
but
the
was
afraid
that
if
they
reported
it
they
might
be
blamed
for
breaking
it
and
the
owner
might
expect
the
firm
to
put
it
right
for
nothing
so
they
decided
to
say
nothing
about
it
the
pinnacle
is
still
on
the
apex
of
the
steeple
waiting
for
a
sufficiently
strong
wind
to
blow
it
down
on
somebody
head
when
the
other
men
heard
of
easton
shave
most
of
them
said
that
it
would
have
served
him
bloody
well
right
if
he
had
fallen
and
broken
his
neck
he
should
have
refused
to
go
up
at
all
without
a
proper
scaffold
that
was
what
they
would
have
done
if
misery
or
the
coddy
had
ordered
any
of
them
to
go
up
and
paint
the
pinnacle
off
that
ladder
they
would
have
chucked
their
tools
down
and
demanded
their
that
was
what
they
said
but
somehow
or
other
it
never
happened
that
any
of
them
ever
their
tools
down
at
all
although
such
dangerous
jobs
were
of
very
frequent
occurrence
the
scamping
business
was
not
confined
to
houses
or
properties
of
an
inferior
class
it
was
the
general
rule
large
houses
villas
and
mansions
the
residences
of
wealthy
people
were
done
in
exactly
the
same
way
generally
in
such
places
costly
and
beautiful
materials
were
spoilt
in
the
using
there
was
a
large
mansion
where
the
interior
woodwork
the
doors
windows
and
staircase
had
to
be
finished
in
white
enamel
it
was
rather
an
old
house
and
the
woodwork
needed
rubbing
down
and
filling
up
before
being
repainted
but
of
course
there
was
not
time
for
that
so
they
painted
it
without
properly
preparing
it
and
when
it
was
enamelled
the
rough
uneven
surface
of
the
wood
looked
horrible
but
the
owner
appeared
quite
satisfied
because
it
was
nice
and
shiny
the
of
the
same
house
was
papered
with
a
beautiful
and
expensive
plush
paper
the
ground
of
this
was
made
to
imitate
crimson
watered
silk
and
it
was
covered
with
a
raised
pattern
in
plush
of
the
same
colour
the
price
marked
on
the
back
of
this
paper
in
the
pattern
book
was
eighteen
shillings
a
roll
slyme
was
paid
sixpence
a
roll
for
hanging
it
the
room
took
ten
rolls
so
it
cost
nine
pounds
for
the
paper
and
five
shillings
to
hang
it
to
fix
such
a
paper
as
this
properly
the
walls
should
first
be
done
with
a
plain
lining
paper
of
the
same
colour
as
the
ground
of
the
wallpaper
itself
because
unless
the
paperhanger
the
joints
which
should
not
be
done
they
are
apt
to
open
a
little
as
the
paper
dries
and
to
show
the
white
wall
underneath
slyme
suggested
this
lining
to
misery
who
would
not
entertain
the
idea
for
a
moment
they
had
gone
to
quite
enough
expense
as
it
was
stripping
the
old
paper
off
so
slyme
went
ahead
and
as
he
had
to
make
his
wages
he
could
not
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
over
it
some
of
the
joints
were
and
some
were
butted
and
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
owner
of
the
house
moved
in
as
the
paper
became
more
dry
the
joints
began
to
open
and
to
show
the
white
plaster
of
the
wall
and
then
owen
had
to
go
there
with
a
small
pot
of
crimson
paint
and
a
little
brush
and
touch
out
the
white
line
while
he
was
doing
this
he
noticed
and
touched
up
a
number
of
other
faults
places
where
slyme
in
his
haste
to
get
the
work
done
had
slobbered
and
smeared
the
face
of
the
paper
with
fingermarks
and
paste
the
same
ghastly
mess
was
made
of
several
other
besides
this
one
and
presently
they
adopted
the
plan
of
painting
strips
of
colour
on
the
wall
in
the
places
where
the
joints
would
come
so
that
if
they
opened
the
white
wall
would
not
show
but
it
was
found
that
the
paste
on
the
back
of
the
paper
dragged
the
paint
off
the
wall
and
when
the
joints
opened
the
white
streaks
showed
all
the
same
so
misery
abandoned
all
attempts
to
prevent
joints
showing
and
if
a
customer
complained
he
sent
someone
to
it
up
but
the
lining
paper
was
never
used
unless
the
customer
or
the
architect
knew
enough
about
the
work
to
insist
upon
it
in
other
parts
of
the
same
house
the
ceilings
the
friezes
and
the
dados
were
covered
with
or
papers
these
hangings
require
very
careful
handling
for
the
raised
parts
are
easily
damaged
but
the
men
who
fixed
them
were
not
allowed
to
take
the
pains
and
time
necessary
to
make
good
work
consequently
in
many
places
especially
at
the
joints
the
pattern
was
flattened
out
and
obliterated
the
ceiling
of
the
was
done
with
a
very
thick
paper
that
was
made
in
sheets
about
two
feet
square
these
squares
were
not
very
true
in
shape
they
had
evidently
warped
in
drying
after
manufacture
to
make
them
match
anything
like
properly
would
need
considerable
time
and
care
but
the
men
were
not
allowed
to
take
the
necessary
time
the
result
was
that
when
it
was
finished
it
presented
a
sort
of
appearance
but
it
did
matter
nothing
seemed
to
matter
except
to
get
it
done
one
would
think
from
the
way
the
hands
were
driven
and
chivvied
and
hurried
over
the
work
that
they
were
being
paid
five
or
six
shillings
an
hour
instead
of
as
many
pence
it
done
shouted
misery
from
morning
till
night
god
sake
get
it
done
have
you
finished
yet
we
losing
money
over
this
job
if
you
chaps
do
wake
up
and
move
a
bit
quicker
i
shall
see
if
i
ca
get
somebody
else
who
will
these
costly
embossed
decorations
were
usually
finished
in
white
but
instead
of
carefully
coating
them
with
specially
prepared
paint
of
patent
distemper
which
would
need
two
or
three
coats
they
slobbered
one
thick
coat
of
common
whitewash
on
to
it
with
ordinary
whitewash
brushes
this
was
a
most
economical
way
to
get
over
it
because
it
made
it
unnecessary
to
stop
up
the
joints
beforehand
the
whitewash
filled
up
all
the
cracks
and
it
also
filled
up
the
hollow
parts
the
crevices
and
interstices
of
the
ornament
destroying
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
beautiful
designs
and
reducing
the
whole
to
a
lumpy
formless
mass
but
that
did
not
matter
either
so
long
as
they
got
it
done
the
architect
did
notice
it
because
he
knew
that
the
more
rushton
made
out
of
the
the
more
he
himself
would
make
the
man
who
had
to
pay
for
the
work
did
notice
it
he
had
the
fullest
confidence
in
the
architect
at
the
risk
of
wearying
the
reader
mention
must
be
made
of
an
affair
that
happened
at
this
particular
the
windows
were
all
fitted
with
venetian
blinds
the
gentleman
for
whom
all
the
work
was
being
done
had
only
just
purchased
the
house
but
he
preferred
roller
blinds
he
had
had
roller
blinds
in
his
former
residence
which
he
had
just
sold
and
as
these
roller
blinds
were
about
the
right
size
he
decided
to
have
them
fitted
to
the
windows
of
his
new
house
so
he
instructed
mr
rushton
to
have
all
the
venetian
blinds
taken
down
and
stored
away
up
in
the
loft
under
the
roof
mr
rushton
promised
to
have
this
done
but
they
were
not
all
put
away
under
the
roof
he
had
four
of
them
taken
to
his
own
place
and
fitted
up
in
the
conservatory
they
were
a
little
too
large
so
they
had
to
be
narrowed
before
they
were
fixed
the
sequel
was
rather
interesting
for
it
happened
that
when
the
gentleman
attempted
to
take
the
roller
blinds
from
his
old
house
the
person
to
whom
he
had
sold
it
refused
to
allow
them
to
be
removed
claiming
that
when
he
bought
the
house
he
bought
the
blinds
also
there
was
a
little
dispute
but
eventually
it
was
settled
that
way
and
the
gentleman
decided
that
he
would
have
the
venetian
blinds
in
his
new
house
after
all
and
instructed
the
people
who
moved
his
furniture
to
take
the
venetians
down
again
from
under
the
roof
and
refix
them
and
then
of
course
it
was
discovered
that
four
of
the
blinds
were
missing
mr
rushton
was
sent
for
and
he
said
that
he
understand
it
at
all
the
only
possible
explanation
that
he
could
think
of
was
that
some
of
his
workmen
must
have
stolen
them
he
would
make
inquiries
and
endeavour
to
discover
the
culprits
but
in
any
case
as
this
had
happened
while
things
were
in
his
charge
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
recovering
them
he
would
replace
them
as
the
blinds
had
been
narrowed
to
fit
the
conservatory
he
had
to
have
four
new
ones
made
the
customer
was
of
course
quite
satisfied
although
very
sorry
for
mr
rushton
they
had
a
little
chat
about
it
rushton
told
the
gentleman
that
he
would
be
astonished
if
he
knew
all
the
facts
the
difficulties
one
has
to
contend
with
in
dealing
with
working
men
one
has
to
watch
them
continually
directly
one
back
is
turned
they
leave
off
working
they
come
late
in
the
morning
and
go
home
before
the
proper
time
at
night
and
then
unless
one
actually
happens
to
catch
them
they
charge
the
full
number
of
hours
on
their
time
sheets
every
now
and
then
something
would
be
missing
and
of
course
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
sometimes
one
would
go
unexpectedly
to
a
and
find
a
lot
of
them
drunk
of
course
one
tried
to
cope
with
these
evils
by
means
of
rules
and
restrictions
and
organization
but
it
was
very
difficult
one
could
not
be
everywhere
or
have
eyes
at
the
back
of
one
head
the
gentleman
said
that
he
had
some
idea
of
what
it
was
like
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
lower
orders
himself
at
one
time
and
another
and
he
knew
they
needed
a
lot
of
watching
rushton
felt
rather
sick
over
this
affair
but
he
consoled
himself
by
reflecting
that
he
had
got
clear
away
with
several
valuable
rose
trees
and
other
plants
which
he
had
stolen
out
of
the
garden
and
that
a
ladder
which
had
been
discovered
in
the
hayloft
over
the
stable
and
taken
by
his
instructions
to
the
when
the
was
finished
had
not
been
missed
another
circumstance
which
helped
to
compensate
for
the
blinds
was
that
the
brass
fittings
throughout
the
house
and
locks
bolts
and
door
handles
which
were
supposed
to
be
all
new
and
which
the
customer
had
paid
a
good
price
for
were
really
all
the
old
ones
which
misery
had
had
and
refixed
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
this
affair
of
the
blinds
for
rushton
and
misery
robbed
everybody
they
made
a
practice
of
annexing
every
thing
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
provided
it
could
be
done
without
danger
to
themselves
they
never
did
anything
of
a
heroic
or
character
they
had
not
the
courage
to
break
into
banks
or
jewellers
shops
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
to
go
out
picking
pockets
all
their
robberies
were
of
the
order
at
one
house
that
they
up
misery
made
a
big
haul
he
had
to
get
up
into
the
loft
under
the
roof
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
the
water
tank
when
he
got
up
there
he
found
a
very
fine
hall
gas
lamp
made
of
wrought
brass
and
copper
with
stained
and
painted
glass
sides
although
covered
with
dust
it
was
otherwise
in
perfect
condition
so
misery
had
it
taken
to
his
own
house
and
cleaned
up
and
fixed
in
the
hall
in
the
same
loft
there
were
a
lot
of
old
brass
picture
rods
and
other
fittings
and
three
very
good
planks
each
about
ten
feet
in
length
these
latter
had
been
placed
across
the
rafters
so
that
one
could
walk
easily
and
safely
over
to
the
tank
but
misery
thought
they
would
be
very
useful
to
the
firm
for
whitewashing
ceilings
and
other
work
so
he
had
them
taken
to
the
yard
along
with
the
old
brass
which
was
worth
about
fourpence
a
pound
there
was
another
house
that
had
to
be
painted
inside
the
people
who
used
to
live
there
had
only
just
left
they
had
moved
to
some
other
town
and
the
house
had
been
before
they
vacated
it
the
new
tenant
had
agreed
with
the
agent
that
the
house
was
to
be
renovated
throughout
before
he
took
possession
the
day
after
the
old
tenants
moved
away
the
agent
gave
rushton
the
key
so
that
he
could
go
to
see
what
was
to
be
done
and
give
an
estimate
for
the
work
while
rushton
and
misery
were
looking
over
the
house
they
discovered
a
large
barometer
hanging
on
the
wall
behind
the
front
door
it
had
been
overlooked
by
those
who
removed
the
furniture
before
returning
the
key
to
the
agent
rushton
sent
one
of
his
men
to
the
house
for
the
barometer
which
he
kept
in
his
office
for
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
inquiries
about
it
if
there
had
been
it
would
have
been
easy
to
say
that
he
had
brought
it
there
for
safety
to
take
care
of
till
he
could
find
the
owner
the
people
to
whom
it
belonged
thought
the
thing
had
been
lost
or
stolen
in
transit
and
afterwards
one
of
the
workmen
who
had
assisted
to
pack
and
remove
the
furniture
was
dismissed
from
his
employment
on
suspicion
of
having
had
something
to
do
with
its
disappearance
no
one
ever
thought
of
rushton
in
connection
with
the
matter
so
after
about
a
month
he
had
it
taken
to
his
own
dwelling
and
hung
up
in
the
hall
near
the
carved
oak
console
table
that
he
had
sneaked
last
summer
from
grand
parade
and
there
it
hangs
unto
this
day
and
close
behind
it
supported
by
cords
of
crimson
silk
is
a
beautiful
card
about
a
foot
square
and
upon
this
card
is
written
in
letters
of
gold
is
the
head
of
this
house
the
unseen
guest
at
every
meal
the
silent
listener
to
every
conversation
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
barometer
is
another
card
of
the
same
kind
and
size
which
says
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
from
another
place
they
stole
two
large
brass
chandeliers
this
house
had
been
empty
for
a
very
long
time
and
its
owner
who
did
not
reside
in
the
town
wished
to
sell
it
the
agent
to
improve
the
chances
of
a
sale
decided
to
have
the
house
overhauled
and
redecorated
rushton
tender
being
the
lowest
they
got
the
work
the
chandeliers
in
the
and
the
were
of
massive
brass
but
they
were
all
blackened
and
tarnished
misery
suggested
to
the
agent
that
they
could
be
cleaned
and
relacquered
which
would
make
them
equal
to
new
in
fact
they
would
be
better
than
new
ones
for
such
things
as
these
were
not
made
now
and
for
once
misery
was
telling
the
truth
the
agent
agreed
and
the
work
was
done
it
was
an
extra
of
course
and
as
the
firm
got
twice
as
much
for
the
job
as
they
paid
for
having
it
done
they
were
almost
satisfied
when
this
and
all
the
other
work
was
finished
they
sent
in
their
account
and
were
paid
some
months
afterwards
the
house
was
sold
and
nimrod
interviewed
the
new
proprietor
with
the
object
of
securing
the
order
for
any
work
that
he
might
want
done
he
was
successful
the
papers
on
the
walls
of
several
of
the
rooms
were
not
to
the
new
owner
taste
and
of
course
the
woodwork
would
have
to
be
to
harmonize
with
the
new
paper
there
was
a
lot
of
other
work
besides
this
a
new
conservatory
to
build
a
more
modern
bath
and
heating
apparatus
to
be
put
in
and
the
electric
light
to
be
installed
the
new
people
having
an
objection
to
the
use
of
gas
the
specifications
were
prepared
by
an
architect
and
rushton
secured
the
work
when
the
chandeliers
were
taken
down
the
men
instructed
by
misery
put
them
on
a
handcart
and
covered
them
over
with
sacks
and
and
took
them
to
the
front
shop
where
they
were
placed
for
sale
with
the
other
stock
when
all
the
work
at
the
house
was
finished
it
occurred
to
rushton
and
nimrod
that
when
the
architect
came
to
examine
and
pass
the
work
before
giving
them
the
certificate
that
would
enable
them
to
present
their
account
he
might
remember
the
chandeliers
and
inquire
what
had
become
of
them
so
they
were
again
placed
on
the
handcart
covered
with
sacks
and
taken
back
to
the
house
and
put
up
in
the
loft
under
the
roof
so
that
if
he
asked
for
them
there
they
were
the
architect
came
looked
ever
the
house
passed
the
work
and
gave
his
certificate
he
never
mentioned
or
thought
of
the
chandeliers
the
owner
of
the
house
was
present
and
asked
for
rushton
bill
for
which
he
at
once
gave
them
a
cheque
and
rushton
and
misery
almost
grovelled
and
wallowed
on
the
ground
before
him
throughout
the
whole
interview
the
architect
and
the
had
kept
their
hats
on
but
rushton
and
nimrod
had
been
respectfully
uncovered
all
the
time
and
as
they
followed
the
other
two
about
the
house
their
bearing
had
been
expressive
of
the
most
abject
servility
when
the
architect
and
the
owner
were
gone
the
two
chandeliers
were
taken
down
again
from
under
the
roof
and
put
upon
a
handcart
covered
over
with
sacks
and
and
taken
back
to
the
shop
and
again
placed
for
sale
with
the
other
stock
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
petty
thefts
committed
by
these
people
to
give
anything
approaching
a
full
account
of
all
the
rest
would
require
a
separate
volume
as
a
result
of
all
the
hurrying
and
scamping
every
now
and
again
the
men
found
that
they
had
worked
themselves
out
of
a
job
several
times
during
the
summer
the
firm
had
scarcely
anything
to
do
and
nearly
everybody
had
to
stand
off
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
when
newman
got
his
first
start
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
he
had
only
been
working
for
about
a
fortnight
when
with
several
others
he
was
off
fortunately
however
the
day
after
he
left
rushtons
he
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
start
for
another
firm
driver
and
botchit
where
he
worked
for
nearly
a
month
and
then
he
was
again
given
a
job
at
rushton
who
happened
to
be
busy
again
he
did
not
have
to
lose
much
time
for
he
up
for
driver
and
botchit
on
a
thursday
night
and
on
the
friday
he
interviewed
misery
who
told
him
they
were
about
to
commence
a
fresh
on
the
following
monday
morning
at
six
and
that
he
could
start
with
them
so
this
time
newman
was
only
out
of
work
the
friday
and
saturday
which
was
another
stroke
of
luck
because
it
often
happens
that
a
man
has
to
lose
a
week
or
more
after
up
for
one
firm
before
he
gets
another
all
through
the
summer
crass
continued
to
be
the
general
most
of
his
time
being
spent
at
the
shop
mixing
up
colours
for
all
the
different
he
also
acted
as
a
sort
of
lieutenant
to
hunter
who
as
the
reader
has
already
been
informed
was
not
a
practical
painter
when
there
was
a
price
to
be
given
for
some
painting
work
misery
sometimes
took
crass
with
him
to
look
over
it
and
help
him
to
estimate
the
amount
of
time
and
material
it
would
take
crass
was
thus
in
a
position
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
not
only
being
superior
to
the
but
also
ranking
above
the
other
who
had
charge
of
the
it
was
crass
and
these
who
were
to
blame
for
most
of
the
scamping
and
driving
because
if
it
had
not
been
for
them
neither
rushton
nor
hunter
would
have
known
how
to
scheme
the
work
of
course
hunter
and
rushton
wanted
to
drive
and
scamp
but
not
being
practical
men
they
would
not
have
known
how
if
it
had
not
been
for
crass
and
the
others
who
put
them
up
to
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
crass
knew
that
when
the
men
stayed
till
half
past
seven
they
were
in
the
habit
of
ceasing
work
for
a
few
minutes
to
eat
a
mouthful
of
grub
about
six
so
he
suggested
to
misery
that
as
it
was
not
possible
to
stop
this
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
make
the
men
stop
work
altogether
from
half
past
five
till
six
and
lose
half
an
pay
and
to
make
up
the
time
instead
of
leaving
off
at
they
could
work
till
eight
misery
had
known
of
and
winked
at
the
former
practice
for
he
knew
that
the
men
could
not
work
all
that
time
without
something
to
eat
but
crass
suggestion
seemed
a
much
better
way
and
it
was
adopted
when
the
other
masters
in
mugsborough
heard
of
this
great
reform
they
all
followed
suit
and
it
became
the
rule
in
that
town
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
work
overtime
for
the
men
to
stay
till
eight
instead
of
half
past
seven
as
formerly
and
they
got
no
more
pay
than
before
previous
to
this
summer
it
had
been
the
almost
invariable
rule
to
have
two
men
in
each
room
that
was
being
painted
but
crass
pointed
out
to
misery
that
under
such
circumstances
they
wasted
time
talking
to
each
other
and
they
also
acted
as
a
check
on
one
another
each
of
them
regulated
the
amount
of
work
he
did
by
the
amount
the
other
did
and
if
the
took
too
long
it
was
always
difficult
to
decide
which
of
the
two
was
to
blame
but
if
they
were
made
to
work
alone
each
of
them
would
be
on
his
mettle
he
would
not
know
how
much
the
others
were
doing
and
the
fear
of
being
considered
slow
in
comparison
with
others
would
make
them
all
tear
into
it
all
they
could
misery
thought
this
a
very
good
idea
so
the
solitary
system
was
introduced
and
as
far
as
practicable
one
room
one
man
became
the
rule
they
even
tried
to
make
the
men
distemper
large
ceilings
and
succeeded
in
one
or
two
cases
but
after
several
ceilings
had
been
spoilt
and
had
to
be
washed
off
and
done
over
again
they
gave
that
up
but
nearly
all
the
other
work
was
now
arranged
on
the
system
and
it
worked
splendidly
each
man
was
constantly
in
a
state
of
panic
as
to
whether
the
others
were
doing
more
work
than
himself
another
suggestion
that
crass
made
to
misery
was
that
the
should
be
instructed
never
to
send
a
man
into
a
room
to
prepare
it
for
painting
you
sends
a
man
into
a
room
to
get
it
ready
said
crass
makes
a
meal
of
it
spends
as
much
time
messin
about
rubbin
down
and
stoppin
up
as
it
would
take
to
paint
it
but
he
added
with
a
cunning
leer
a
bit
of
putty
and
a
little
bit
of
and
the
paint
at
the
stand
and
then
gits
it
in
mind
as
going
in
there
to
paint
it
and
does
mess
about
much
over
the
preparing
of
it
these
and
many
other
suggestions
all
sorts
of
devices
for
scamping
and
getting
over
the
work
were
schemed
out
by
crass
and
the
other
who
put
them
into
practice
and
showed
them
to
misery
and
rushton
in
the
hope
of
currying
favour
with
them
and
being
on
and
between
the
lot
of
them
they
made
life
a
veritable
hell
for
themselves
and
the
hands
and
everybody
else
around
them
and
the
mainspring
of
it
all
was
the
greed
and
selfishness
of
one
man
who
desired
to
accumulate
money
for
this
was
the
only
object
of
all
the
driving
and
bullying
and
hatred
and
cursing
and
unhappiness
to
make
money
for
rushton
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
deserving
case
it
is
sad
and
discreditable
but
nevertheless
true
that
some
of
the
more
selfish
of
the
philanthropists
often
became
weary
of
and
lost
all
enthusiasm
in
the
good
cause
at
such
times
they
used
to
say
that
they
were
well
fed
up
with
the
whole
business
and
of
tearing
their
bloody
guts
out
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
and
every
now
and
then
some
of
these
fellows
would
work
and
go
on
the
booze
sometimes
stopping
away
for
two
or
three
days
or
a
week
at
a
time
and
then
when
it
was
all
over
they
came
back
very
penitent
to
ask
for
another
but
they
generally
found
that
their
places
had
been
filled
if
they
happened
to
be
good
men
who
made
a
practice
of
their
guts
out
when
they
did
work
they
were
usually
forgiven
and
after
being
admonished
by
misery
permitted
to
resume
work
with
the
understanding
that
if
ever
it
occurred
again
they
would
get
the
which
means
the
final
and
irrevocable
sack
there
was
once
a
job
at
a
shop
that
had
been
a
restaurant
kept
by
a
renowned
italian
chef
it
had
been
known
as
royal
italian
situated
on
the
grand
parade
it
was
a
favourite
resort
of
the
who
frequented
it
for
afternoon
tea
and
coffee
and
for
little
suppers
after
the
theatre
it
had
windows
resplendent
with
gilding
tables
with
snow
white
covers
vases
of
flowers
and
all
the
other
appurtenances
of
glittering
cut
glass
and
silver
the
obsequious
waiters
were
in
evening
dress
the
walls
were
covered
with
lofty
mirrors
in
carved
and
gilded
frames
and
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
and
night
an
orchestra
consisting
of
two
violins
and
a
harp
discoursed
selections
of
classic
music
but
of
late
years
the
business
had
not
been
paying
and
finally
the
proprietor
went
bankrupt
and
was
sold
out
the
place
was
shut
up
for
several
months
before
the
shop
was
let
to
a
firm
of
dealers
in
fancy
articles
and
the
other
part
was
transformed
into
flats
rushton
had
the
contract
for
the
work
when
the
men
went
there
to
it
up
they
found
the
interior
of
the
house
in
a
state
of
indescribable
filth
the
ceilings
discoloured
with
smoke
and
hung
with
cobwebs
the
wallpapers
smeared
and
black
with
grease
the
handrails
and
the
newel
posts
of
the
staircase
were
clammy
with
filth
and
the
edges
of
the
doors
near
the
handles
were
blackened
with
greasy
dirt
and
the
tops
of
the
skirtings
the
mouldings
of
the
doors
the
sashes
of
the
windows
and
the
corners
of
the
floors
were
thick
with
the
accumulated
dust
of
years
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
which
had
evidently
been
used
as
a
nursery
or
playroom
for
the
children
of
the
renowned
chef
the
wallpaper
for
about
two
feet
above
the
skirting
was
blackened
with
grease
and
ornamented
with
childish
drawings
made
with
burnt
sticks
and
blacklead
pencils
the
door
being
covered
with
similar
artistic
efforts
to
say
nothing
of
some
rude
attempts
at
carving
evidently
executed
with
an
axe
or
a
hammer
but
all
this
filth
was
nothing
compared
with
the
unspeakable
condition
of
the
kitchen
and
scullery
a
detailed
description
of
which
would
cause
the
blood
of
the
reader
to
curdle
and
each
particular
hair
of
his
head
to
stand
on
end
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
the
walls
the
ceiling
the
floor
the
paintwork
the
the
kitchen
range
the
dresser
and
everything
else
were
uniformly
absolutely
and
literally
black
and
the
black
was
composed
of
soot
and
grease
in
front
of
the
window
there
was
a
fixture
a
kind
of
bench
or
table
deeply
scored
with
marks
of
knives
like
a
butcher
block
the
sill
of
the
window
was
about
six
inches
lower
than
the
top
of
the
table
so
that
between
the
glass
of
the
lower
sash
of
the
window
which
had
evidently
never
been
raised
and
the
back
of
the
table
there
was
a
long
narrow
cavity
or
trough
about
six
inches
deep
four
inches
wide
and
as
long
as
the
width
of
the
window
the
sill
forming
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
this
trough
was
filled
with
all
manner
of
abominations
fragments
of
fat
and
decomposed
meat
legs
of
rabbits
and
fowls
vegetable
matter
broken
knives
and
forks
and
hair
and
the
glass
of
the
window
was
caked
with
filth
of
the
same
description
this
job
was
the
cause
of
the
sacking
of
the
and
another
man
named
bill
bates
who
were
sent
into
the
kitchen
to
clean
it
down
and
prepare
it
for
painting
and
distempering
they
commenced
to
do
it
but
it
made
them
feel
so
ill
that
they
went
out
and
had
a
pint
each
and
after
that
they
made
another
start
at
it
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
felt
that
it
was
imperatively
necessary
to
have
another
drink
so
they
went
over
to
the
pub
and
this
time
they
had
two
pints
each
bill
paid
for
the
first
two
and
then
the
refused
to
return
to
work
unless
bill
would
consent
to
have
another
pint
with
him
before
going
back
when
they
had
drunk
the
two
pints
they
decided
in
order
to
save
themselves
the
trouble
and
risk
of
coming
away
from
the
job
to
take
a
couple
of
quarts
back
with
them
in
two
bottles
which
the
landlord
of
the
pub
lent
them
charging
twopence
on
each
bottle
to
be
refunded
when
they
were
returned
when
they
got
back
to
the
job
they
found
the
in
the
kitchen
looking
for
them
and
he
began
to
talk
and
grumble
but
the
soon
shut
him
up
he
told
him
he
could
either
have
a
drink
out
of
one
of
the
bottles
or
a
punch
in
the
bloody
nose
whichever
he
liked
or
if
he
did
not
fancy
either
of
these
alternatives
he
could
go
to
hell
as
the
was
a
sensible
man
he
took
the
beer
and
advised
them
to
pull
themselves
together
and
try
to
get
some
work
done
before
misery
came
which
they
promised
to
do
when
the
was
gone
they
made
another
attempt
at
the
work
misery
came
a
little
while
afterwards
and
began
shouting
at
them
because
he
said
he
could
not
see
what
they
had
done
it
looked
as
if
they
had
been
asleep
all
the
morning
here
it
was
nearly
ten
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
they
had
done
nothing
when
he
was
gone
they
drank
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
then
they
began
to
feel
inclined
to
laugh
what
did
they
care
for
hunter
or
rushton
either
to
hell
with
both
of
they
left
off
scraping
and
scrubbing
and
began
throwing
buckets
of
water
over
the
dresser
and
the
walls
laughing
uproariously
all
the
time
show
the
b
s
how
to
wash
down
paintwork
shouted
the
as
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
hurled
a
pailful
of
water
over
the
door
of
the
cupboard
us
another
bucket
of
water
bill
bill
was
out
in
the
scullery
filling
his
pail
under
the
tap
and
laughing
so
much
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
as
soon
as
it
was
full
he
passed
it
to
the
who
threw
it
bodily
pail
and
all
on
to
the
bench
in
front
of
the
window
smashing
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
the
water
poured
off
the
table
and
all
over
the
floor
bill
brought
the
next
pailful
in
and
threw
it
at
the
kitchen
door
splitting
one
of
the
panels
from
top
to
bottom
and
then
they
threw
about
half
a
dozen
more
pailfuls
over
the
dresser
show
the
b
rs
how
to
clean
paintwork
they
shouted
as
they
hurled
the
buckets
at
the
walls
and
doors
by
this
time
the
floor
was
deluged
with
water
which
mingled
with
the
filth
and
formed
a
sea
of
mud
they
left
the
two
taps
running
in
the
scullery
and
as
the
waste
pipe
of
the
sink
was
choked
up
with
dirt
the
sink
filled
up
and
overflowed
like
a
miniature
niagara
the
water
ran
out
under
the
doors
into
the
and
along
the
passage
out
to
the
front
door
but
bill
bates
and
the
remained
in
the
kitchen
smashing
the
pails
at
the
walls
and
doors
and
the
dresser
and
cursing
and
laughing
hysterically
they
had
just
filled
the
two
buckets
and
were
bringing
them
into
the
kitchen
when
they
heard
hunter
voice
in
the
passage
shouting
out
inquiries
as
to
where
all
that
water
came
from
then
they
heard
him
advancing
towards
them
and
they
stood
waiting
for
him
with
the
pails
in
their
hands
and
directly
he
opened
the
door
and
put
his
head
into
the
room
they
let
fly
the
two
pails
at
him
unfortunately
they
were
too
drunk
and
excited
to
aim
straight
one
pail
struck
the
middle
rail
of
the
door
and
the
other
the
wall
by
the
side
of
it
misery
hastily
shut
the
door
again
and
ran
upstairs
and
presently
the
came
down
and
called
out
to
them
from
the
passage
they
went
out
to
see
what
he
wanted
and
he
told
them
that
misery
had
gone
to
the
office
to
get
their
wages
ready
they
were
to
make
out
their
time
sheets
and
go
for
their
money
at
once
misery
had
said
that
if
they
were
not
there
in
ten
minutes
he
would
have
the
pair
of
them
locked
up
the
said
that
nothing
would
suit
them
better
than
to
have
all
their
pieces
at
once
they
had
spent
all
their
money
and
wanted
another
drink
bill
bates
concurred
so
they
borrowed
a
piece
of
blacklead
pencil
from
the
and
made
out
their
time
sheets
took
off
their
aprons
put
them
into
their
tool
bags
and
went
to
the
office
for
their
money
which
misery
passed
out
to
them
through
the
the
news
of
this
exploit
spread
all
over
the
town
during
that
day
and
evening
and
although
it
was
in
july
the
next
morning
at
six
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
waiting
at
the
yard
to
ask
misery
if
there
was
chance
of
a
job
bill
bates
and
the
had
had
their
spree
and
had
got
the
sack
for
it
and
most
of
the
chaps
said
it
served
them
right
such
conduct
as
that
was
going
too
far
most
of
them
would
have
said
the
same
thing
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
might
have
been
they
had
very
little
sympathy
for
each
other
at
any
time
often
when
for
instance
one
man
was
sent
away
from
one
to
another
the
others
would
go
into
his
room
and
look
at
the
work
he
had
been
doing
and
pick
out
all
the
faults
they
could
find
and
show
them
to
each
other
making
all
sorts
of
remarks
about
the
absent
one
meanwhile
run
yer
nose
over
that
door
jim
one
would
say
in
a
tone
of
disgust
think
of
it
did
yer
ever
see
sich
a
mess
in
yer
life
calls
hisself
a
painter
and
the
other
man
would
shake
his
head
sadly
and
say
that
although
the
one
who
had
done
it
had
never
been
up
to
much
as
a
workman
he
could
do
it
a
bit
better
than
that
if
he
liked
but
the
fact
was
that
he
never
gave
himself
time
to
do
anything
properly
he
was
always
tearing
his
bloody
guts
out
why
he
only
been
in
this
room
about
four
hours
from
start
to
finish
he
ought
to
have
a
watering
cart
to
follow
him
about
because
he
worked
at
such
a
hell
of
a
rate
you
could
see
him
for
dust
and
then
the
first
man
would
reply
that
other
people
could
do
as
they
liked
but
for
his
part
he
was
not
going
to
tear
his
guts
out
for
nobody
the
second
man
would
applaud
these
sentiments
and
say
that
he
going
to
tear
his
out
either
and
then
they
would
both
go
back
to
their
respective
rooms
and
tear
into
the
work
for
all
they
were
worth
making
the
same
sort
of
as
the
one
they
had
been
criticizing
and
afterwards
when
the
other
back
was
turned
each
of
them
in
turn
would
sneak
into
the
other
room
and
criticize
it
and
point
out
the
faults
to
anyone
else
who
happened
to
be
near
at
hand
harlow
was
working
at
the
place
that
had
been
macaroni
cafe
when
one
day
a
note
was
sent
to
him
from
hunter
at
the
shop
it
was
written
on
a
scrap
of
wallpaper
and
worded
in
the
usual
manner
of
such
notes
as
if
the
writer
had
studied
how
to
avoid
all
suspicion
of
being
unduly
civil
harlow
go
to
the
yard
at
once
take
your
tools
with
you
crass
will
tell
you
where
you
have
to
go
they
were
just
finishing
their
dinners
when
the
boy
brought
this
note
and
after
reading
it
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
harlow
remarked
that
it
was
worded
in
much
the
same
way
in
which
one
would
speak
to
a
dog
the
others
said
nothing
but
after
he
was
gone
the
other
men
who
all
considered
that
it
was
ridiculous
for
the
of
us
to
expect
or
wish
to
be
treated
with
common
civility
laughed
about
it
and
said
that
harlow
was
beginning
to
think
he
was
somebody
they
supposed
it
was
through
readin
all
those
books
what
owen
was
always
lendin
and
then
one
of
them
got
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
a
note
to
be
given
to
harlow
at
the
first
opportunity
this
note
was
properly
worded
written
in
a
manner
suitable
for
a
gentleman
like
him
neatly
folded
and
addressed
mr
harlow
macaroni
royal
cafe
till
called
for
mister
harlow
dear
sir
wood
you
kinely
oblige
me
bi
cummin
to
the
paint
shop
as
soon
as
you
can
make
it
convenient
as
there
is
a
sealin
to
be
hoppin
this
is
not
trubbling
you
to
much
i
remane
yours
respeckfully
pontius
pilate
this
note
was
read
out
for
the
amusement
of
the
company
and
afterwards
stored
away
in
the
writer
pocket
till
such
a
time
as
an
opportunity
should
occur
of
giving
it
to
harlow
as
the
writer
of
the
note
was
on
his
way
back
to
his
room
to
resume
work
he
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
had
gone
into
harlow
room
to
criticize
it
and
had
succeeded
in
finding
several
faults
which
he
pointed
out
to
the
other
and
of
course
they
were
both
very
much
disgusted
with
harlow
ca
think
why
the
coddy
keeps
him
on
the
job
said
the
first
man
you
and
me
if
i
had
charge
of
a
job
and
misery
sent
harlow
there
i
send
back
to
the
shop
as
you
agreed
the
other
as
he
went
back
to
tear
into
his
own
room
as
you
old
man
i
should
neither
it
must
not
be
supposed
from
this
that
either
of
these
two
men
were
on
exceptionally
bad
terms
with
harlow
they
were
just
as
good
friends
with
him
to
his
face
as
they
were
with
each
other
to
each
faces
and
it
was
just
their
way
that
was
all
if
it
had
been
one
or
both
of
these
two
who
had
gone
away
instead
of
harlow
just
the
same
things
would
have
been
said
about
them
by
the
others
who
remained
it
was
merely
their
usual
way
of
speaking
about
each
other
behind
each
other
backs
it
was
always
the
same
if
any
one
of
them
made
a
mistake
or
had
an
accident
or
got
into
any
trouble
he
seldom
or
never
got
any
sympathy
from
his
fellow
workmen
on
the
contrary
most
of
them
at
such
times
seemed
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
there
was
a
poor
devil
a
stranger
in
the
town
he
came
from
london
who
got
the
sack
for
breaking
some
glass
he
had
been
sent
to
off
some
old
paint
of
the
woodwork
of
a
window
he
was
not
very
skilful
in
the
use
of
the
lamp
because
on
the
firm
when
he
had
been
working
in
london
it
was
a
job
that
the
ordinary
hands
were
seldom
or
never
called
upon
to
do
there
were
one
or
two
men
who
did
it
all
for
that
matter
not
many
of
rushton
men
were
very
skilful
at
it
either
it
was
a
job
everybody
tried
to
get
out
of
because
nearly
always
the
lamp
went
wrong
and
there
was
a
row
about
the
time
the
work
took
so
they
worked
this
job
on
to
the
stranger
this
man
had
been
out
of
work
for
a
long
time
before
he
got
a
start
at
rushton
and
he
was
very
anxious
not
to
lose
the
job
because
he
had
a
wife
and
family
in
london
when
the
told
him
to
go
and
burn
off
this
window
he
did
not
like
to
say
that
he
was
not
used
to
the
work
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
do
it
but
he
was
very
nervous
and
the
end
was
that
although
he
managed
to
do
the
burning
off
all
right
just
as
he
was
finishing
he
accidentally
allowed
the
flame
of
the
lamp
to
come
into
contact
with
a
large
pane
of
glass
and
broke
it
they
sent
to
the
shop
for
a
new
pane
of
glass
and
the
man
stayed
late
that
night
and
put
it
in
in
his
own
time
thus
bearing
half
the
cost
of
repairing
it
things
were
not
very
busy
just
then
and
on
the
following
saturday
two
of
the
hands
were
off
the
stranger
was
one
of
them
and
nearly
everybody
was
very
pleased
at
mealtimes
the
story
of
the
broken
window
was
repeatedly
told
amid
jeering
laughter
it
really
seemed
as
if
a
certain
amount
of
indignation
was
felt
that
a
stranger
especially
such
an
inferior
person
as
this
chap
who
did
not
know
how
to
use
a
lamp
should
have
had
the
cheek
to
try
to
earn
his
living
at
all
one
thing
was
very
certain
they
said
gleefully
he
would
never
get
another
job
at
rushton
that
was
one
good
thing
and
yet
they
all
knew
that
this
accident
might
have
happened
to
any
one
of
them
once
a
couple
of
men
got
the
sack
because
a
ceiling
they
distempered
had
to
be
washed
off
and
done
again
it
was
not
really
the
men
fault
at
all
it
was
a
ceiling
that
needed
special
treatment
and
they
had
not
been
allowed
to
do
it
properly
but
all
the
same
when
they
got
the
sack
most
of
the
others
laughed
and
sneered
and
were
glad
perhaps
because
they
thought
that
the
fact
that
these
two
unfortunates
had
been
disgraced
increased
their
own
chances
of
being
on
and
so
it
was
with
nearly
everything
with
a
few
exceptions
they
had
an
immense
amount
of
respect
for
rushton
and
hunter
and
very
little
respect
or
sympathy
for
each
other
exactly
the
same
lack
of
feeling
for
each
other
prevailed
amongst
the
members
of
all
the
different
trades
everybody
seemed
glad
if
anybody
got
into
trouble
for
any
reason
whatever
there
was
a
garden
gate
that
had
been
made
at
the
carpenter
shop
it
was
not
very
well
put
together
and
for
the
usual
reason
the
man
had
not
been
allowed
the
time
to
do
it
properly
after
it
was
fixed
one
of
his
shopmates
wrote
upon
it
with
lead
pencil
in
big
letters
is
good
work
for
a
joiner
order
one
ton
of
putty
but
to
hear
them
talking
in
the
pub
of
a
saturday
afternoon
just
after
one
would
think
them
the
best
friends
and
mates
and
the
most
independent
spirits
in
the
world
fellows
whom
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
trifle
with
and
who
would
stick
up
for
each
other
through
thick
and
thin
all
sorts
of
stories
were
related
of
the
wonderful
things
they
had
done
and
said
of
jobs
they
had
up
and
masters
they
had
off
of
pails
of
whitewash
thrown
over
offending
employers
and
of
horrible
assaults
and
batteries
committed
upon
the
same
but
strange
to
say
for
some
reason
or
other
it
seldom
happened
that
a
third
party
ever
witnessed
any
of
these
prodigies
it
seemed
as
if
a
chivalrous
desire
to
spare
the
feelings
of
their
victims
had
always
prevented
them
from
doing
or
saying
anything
to
them
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
when
he
had
drunk
a
few
pints
crass
was
a
very
good
hand
at
these
stories
here
is
one
that
he
told
in
the
bar
of
the
cricketers
on
the
saturday
afternoon
of
the
same
week
that
bill
bates
and
the
got
the
sack
the
cricketers
was
only
a
few
minutes
walk
from
the
shop
and
at
a
number
of
the
men
used
to
go
in
there
to
take
a
drink
before
going
home
thursday

continued
crass
as
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
after
taking
another
drink
out
of
his
glass
and
looking
round
to
note
the
effect
of
the
story
a
larfed
if
you
bin
there
was
fairly
flabbergasted
and
wen
i
said
that
to
i
see

but
not
otherwise
i
ses
as
he
concluded
this
story
crass
drained
his
glass
and
gazed
round
upon
the
audience
who
were
full
of
admiration
they
looked
at
each
other
and
at
crass
and
nodded
their
heads
approvingly
yes
undoubtedly
that
was
the
proper
way
to
deal
with
such
bounders
as
nimrod
take
up
a
strong
attitude

let
see
as
you

no
nonsense

from
the
likes
of
we
not
a
lot
of
bloody
chinamen
are
we
so
far
from
blaming
him
they
all
assured
him
that
they
would
have
acted
in
precisely
the
same
way
under
similar
circumstances
my
part
i
a
bloke
like
this
said
a
tall
man
with
a
very
loud
voice
a
chap
who
nearly
fell
down
dead
every
time
rushton
or
misery
looked
at
him
a
bloke
like

said
everybody
that
was
the
way
to
serve
if
only
everyone
would
do
the
same
as
the
tall
man
who
had
just
paid
for
another
round
of
drinks
things
would
be
a
lot
more
comfortable
than
they

a
little
man
with
a
cutaway

yer
if
you
served
as
you
did
you
most
likely
to
put
up
with
a
lot
more
ole
buck
they
all
agreed
that
the
little
man
had
done
quite
right
they
all
said
that
they
didn
blame
him
in
the
least
they
would
all
have
done
the
same
in
fact
this
was
the
way
they
all
conducted
themselves
whenever
occasion
demanded
it
to
hear
them
talk
one
would
imagine
that
such
affairs
as
the
recent
exploit
of
bill
bates
and
the
were
constantly
taking
place
instead
of
only
occurring
about
once
in
a
blue
moon
crass
stood
the
final
round
of
drinks
and
as
he
evidently
thought
that
circumstance
deserved
to
be
signalized
in
some
special
manner
he
proposed
the
following
toast
which
was
drunk
with
enthusiasm
hell
with
the
man
may
he
never
grow
fat
what
carries
two
faces
under
one
rushton
did
a
lot
of
work
that
summer
they
did
not
have
many
big
jobs
but
there
were
a
lot
of
little
ones
and
the
boy
bert
was
kept
busy
running
from
one
to
the
other
he
spent
most
of
his
time
dragging
a
handcart
with
loads
of
paint
or
planks
and
steps
and
seldom
went
out
to
work
with
the
men
for
when
he
was
not
taking
things
out
to
the
various
places
where
the
philanthropists
were
working
he
was
in
the
paintshop
at
the
yard
scraping
out
dirty
or
helping
crass
to
mix
up
colours
although
scarcely
anyone
seemed
to
notice
it
the
boy
presented
a
truly
pitiable
spectacle
he
was
very
pale
and
thin
dragging
the
handcart
did
not
help
him
to
put
on
flesh
for
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
the
work
made
him
sweat
his
home
was
right
away
on
the
other
side
of
windley
it
took
him
more
than
of
an
hour
to
walk
to
the
shop
and
as
he
had
to
be
at
work
at
six
that
meant
that
he
had
to
leave
home
at
a
few
minutes
past
five
every
morning
so
that
he
always
got
up
about
half
past
four
he
was
wearing
a
man
coat
or
rather
jacket
which
gave
the
upper
part
of
his
body
a
bulky
appearance
the
trousers
were
part
of
a
suit
of
his
own
and
were
somewhat
narrowly
cut
as
is
the
rule
with
cheap
trousers
these
thin
legs
appearing
under
the
big
jacket
gave
him
a
rather
grotesque
appearance
which
was
heightened
by
the
fact
that
all
his
clothes
cap
coat
waistcoat
trousers
and
boots
were
smothered
with
paint
and
distemper
of
various
colours
and
there
were
generally
a
few
streaks
of
paint
of
some
sort
or
other
upon
his
face
and
of
course
his
hands
especially
round
the
fingernails
were
grimed
with
it
but
the
worst
of
all
were
the
dreadful
hobnailed
boots
the
leather
of
the
uppers
of
these
was
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
and
very
stiff
across
the
fore
part
of
the
boot
this
hard
leather
had
warped
into
ridges
and
valleys
which
chafed
his
feet
and
made
them
bleed
the
soles
were
of
an
inch
thick
covered
with
hobnails
and
were
as
hard
and
inflexible
and
almost
as
heavy
as
iron
these
boots
hurt
his
feet
dreadfully
and
made
him
feel
very
tired
and
miserable
for
he
had
such
a
lot
of
walking
to
do
he
used
to
be
jolly
glad
when
came
for
then
he
used
to
get
out
of
sight
in
some
quiet
spot
and
lie
down
for
the
whole
hour
his
favourite
was
up
in
the
loft
over
the
shop
where
they
stored
the
mouldings
and
architraves
no
one
ever
came
there
at
that
hour
and
after
he
had
eaten
his
dinner
he
used
to
lie
down
and
think
and
rest
he
nearly
always
had
an
hour
for
dinner
but
he
did
not
always
have
it
at
the
same
time
sometimes
he
had
it
at
twelve
and
sometimes
not
till
two
it
all
depended
upon
what
stuff
had
to
be
taken
to
the
job
often
it
happened
that
some
men
at
a
distant
job
required
some
material
to
use
immediately
after
dinner
and
perhaps
crass
was
not
able
to
get
it
ready
till
twelve
so
that
it
was
not
possible
to
take
it
before
and
if
bert
left
it
till
after
dinner
the
men
would
be
wasting
their
time
waiting
for
it
so
in
such
cases
he
took
it
there
first
and
had
his
dinner
when
he
came
back
sometimes
he
got
back
about
half
past
twelve
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
take
out
another
lot
of
material
at
one
in
such
a
case
he
half
an
hour
overtime
on
his
time
sheet
he
used
to
get
twopence
an
hour
for
overtime
sometimes
crass
sent
him
with
a
handcart
to
one
job
to
get
a
pair
of
steps
or
tressels
or
a
plank
or
some
material
or
other
and
take
them
to
another
job
and
on
these
occasions
it
was
often
very
late
before
he
was
able
to
take
his
meals
instead
of
getting
his
breakfast
at
eight
it
was
often
nearly
nine
before
he
got
back
to
the
shop
and
frequently
he
had
to
go
without
dinner
until
half
past
one
or
two
sometimes
he
could
scarcely
manage
to
carry
the
pots
of
paint
to
the
jobs
his
feet
were
so
hot
and
sore
when
he
had
to
push
the
cart
it
was
worse
still
and
often
when
time
came
he
felt
so
tired
that
he
could
scarcely
manage
to
walk
home
but
the
weather
was
not
always
hot
or
fine
sometimes
it
was
quite
cold
almost
like
winter
and
there
was
a
lot
of
rain
that
summer
at
such
times
the
boy
frequently
got
wet
through
several
times
a
day
as
he
went
from
one
job
to
another
and
he
had
to
work
all
the
time
in
his
wet
clothes
and
boots
which
were
usually
old
and
out
of
repair
and
let
in
the
water
one
of
the
worst
jobs
that
he
had
to
do
was
when
a
new
stock
of
white
lead
came
in
this
stuff
came
in
wooden
barrels
containing
two
hundredweight
and
he
used
to
have
to
dig
it
out
of
these
barrels
with
a
trowel
and
put
it
into
a
metal
tank
where
it
was
kept
covered
with
water
and
the
empty
barrels
were
returned
to
the
makers
when
he
was
doing
this
work
he
usually
managed
to
get
himself
smeared
all
over
with
the
white
lead
and
this
circumstance
and
the
fact
that
he
was
always
handling
paint
or
some
poisonous
material
or
other
was
doubtless
the
cause
of
the
terrible
pains
he
often
had
in
his
stomach
pains
that
sometimes
caused
him
to
throw
himself
down
and
roll
on
the
ground
in
agony
one
afternoon
crass
sent
him
with
a
handcart
to
a
job
that
easton
philpot
harlow
and
owen
were
just
finishing
he
got
there
about
half
past
four
and
helped
the
men
to
load
up
the
things
and
afterwards
walked
alongside
the
cart
with
them
back
to
the
shop
on
the
way
they
all
noticed
and
remarked
to
each
other
that
the
boy
looked
tired
and
pale
and
that
he
seemed
to
limp
but
he
did
not
say
anything
although
he
guessed
that
they
were
talking
about
him
they
arrived
at
the
shop
a
little
before
time
about
ten
minutes
past
five
bert
helped
them
to
unload
and
afterwards
while
they
were
putting
their
things
away
and
up
the
unused
materials
they
had
brought
back
he
pushed
the
cart
over
to
the
shed
where
it
was
kept
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
he
did
not
return
to
the
shop
at
once
and
a
few
minutes
later
when
harlow
came
out
into
the
yard
to
get
a
bucket
of
water
to
wash
their
hands
with
he
saw
the
boy
leaning
on
the
side
of
the
cart
crying
and
holding
one
foot
off
the
ground
harlow
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
and
while
he
was
speaking
to
him
the
others
came
out
to
see
what
was
up
the
boy
said
he
had
rheumatism
or
growing
pains
or
something
in
his
leg
here
near
the
knee
but
he
did
say
much
he
just
cried
miserably
and
turned
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
avoiding
the
looks
of
the
men
because
he
felt
ashamed
that
they
should
see
him
cry
when
they
saw
how
ill
and
miserable
he
looked
the
men
all
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
to
get
some
coppers
to
give
to
him
so
that
he
could
ride
home
on
the
tram
they
gave
him
fivepence
altogether
more
than
enough
to
ride
all
the
way
and
crass
told
him
to
go
at
once
there
was
no
need
to
wait
till
half
past
but
before
he
went
philpot
got
a
small
glass
bottle
out
of
his
tool
bag
and
filled
it
with
oil
and
turps
two
of
turps
and
one
of
oil
which
he
gave
to
bert
to
rub
into
his
leg
before
going
to
bed
the
turps
he
explained
was
to
cure
the
pain
and
the
oil
was
to
prevent
it
from
hurting
the
skin
he
was
to
get
his
mother
to
rub
it
in
for
him
if
he
were
too
tired
to
do
it
himself
bert
promised
to
observe
these
directions
and
drying
his
tears
took
his
dinner
basket
and
limped
off
to
catch
the
tram
it
was
a
few
days
after
this
that
hunter
met
with
an
accident
he
was
tearing
off
on
his
bicycle
to
one
of
the
jobs
about
five
minutes
to
twelve
to
see
if
he
could
catch
anyone
leaving
off
for
dinner
before
the
proper
time
and
while
going
down
a
rather
steep
hill
the
front
brake
broke
the
rubbers
of
the
rear
one
were
worn
out
and
failed
to
act
so
misery
to
save
himself
from
being
smashed
against
the
railings
of
the
houses
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
threw
himself
off
the
machine
with
the
result
that
his
head
and
face
and
hands
were
terribly
cut
and
bruised
he
was
so
badly
knocked
about
that
he
had
to
remain
at
home
for
nearly
three
weeks
much
to
the
delight
of
the
men
and
the
annoyance
one
might
even
say
the
indignation
of
mr
rushton
who
did
not
know
enough
about
the
work
to
make
out
estimates
without
assistance
there
were
several
large
jobs
to
be
tendered
for
at
the
same
time
so
rushton
sent
the
specifications
round
to
hunter
house
for
him
to
figure
out
the
prices
and
nearly
all
the
time
that
misery
was
at
home
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
swathed
in
bandages
trying
to
calculate
the
probable
cost
of
these
jobs
rushton
did
not
come
to
see
him
but
he
sent
bert
nearly
every
day
either
with
some
specifications
or
some
accounts
or
something
of
that
sort
or
with
a
note
inquiring
when
hunter
thought
he
would
be
able
to
return
to
work
all
sorts
of
rumours
became
prevalent
amongst
the
men
concerning
hunter
condition
he
had
his
spiral
column
he
had
of
the
brain
or
he
had
injured
his
and
would
probably
never
be
able
to
no
more
crass
who
had
helped
mr
rushton
to
up
several
small
jobs
began
to
think
it
might
not
be
altogether
a
bad
thing
for
himself
if
something
were
to
happen
to
hunter
and
he
began
to
put
on
side
and
to
assume
airs
of
authority
he
got
one
of
the
to
assist
him
in
his
work
of
colourman
and
made
him
do
all
the
hard
work
while
he
spent
part
of
his
own
time
visiting
the
different
jobs
to
see
how
the
work
progressed
crass
appearance
did
him
justice
he
was
wearing
a
pair
of
sporting
trousers
the
pattern
of
which
consisted
of
large
black
and
white
squares
the
previous
owner
of
these
trousers
was
taller
and
slighter
than
crass
so
although
the
legs
were
about
a
couple
of
inches
too
long
they
fitted
him
rather
tightly
so
much
so
that
it
was
fortunate
that
he
had
his
present
job
of
colourman
for
if
he
had
had
to
do
any
climbing
up
and
down
ladders
or
steps
the
trousers
would
have
burst
his
jacket
was
also
two
or
three
sizes
too
small
and
the
sleeves
were
so
short
that
the
cuffs
of
his
flanelette
shirt
were
visible
this
coat
was
made
of
serge
and
its
colour
had
presumably
once
been
blue
but
it
was
now
a
sort
of
heliotrope
and
violet
the
greater
part
being
of
the
former
tint
and
the
parts
under
the
sleeves
of
the
latter
this
jacket
fitted
very
tightly
across
the
shoulders
and
back
and
being
much
too
short
left
his
tightly
clad
posteriors
exposed
to
view
he
however
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
anything
peculiar
in
his
appearance
and
was
so
bumptious
and
offensive
that
most
of
the
men
were
almost
glad
when
nimrod
came
back
they
said
that
if
crass
ever
got
the
job
he
would
be
a
dam
sight
worse
than
hunter
as
for
the
latter
for
a
little
while
after
his
return
to
work
it
was
said
that
his
illness
had
improved
his
character
he
had
had
time
to
think
things
over
and
in
short
he
was
ever
so
much
better
than
before
but
it
was
not
long
before
this
story
began
to
be
told
the
other
way
round
he
was
worse
than
ever
and
a
thing
that
happened
about
a
fortnight
after
his
return
caused
more
ill
feeling
and
resentment
against
him
and
rushton
than
had
ever
existed
previously
what
led
up
to
it
was
something
that
was
done
by
bundy
mate
ted
dawson
this
poor
wretch
was
scarcely
ever
seen
without
a
load
of
some
sort
or
other
carrying
a
sack
of
cement
or
plaster
a
heavy
ladder
a
big
bucket
of
mortar
or
dragging
a
load
of
scaffolding
on
a
cart
he
must
have
been
nearly
as
strong
as
a
horse
because
after
working
in
this
manner
for
rushton
from
six
in
the
morning
till
half
past
five
at
night
he
usually
went
to
work
in
his
garden
for
two
or
three
hours
after
tea
and
frequently
went
there
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
morning
before
going
to
work
the
poor
devil
needed
the
produce
of
his
garden
to
supplement
his
wages
for
he
had
a
wife
and
three
children
to
provide
for
and
he
earned
only
or
rather
to
be
correct
he
was
paid
only
fourpence
an
hour
there
was
an
old
house
to
which
they
were
making
some
alterations
and
repairs
and
there
was
a
lot
of
old
wood
taken
out
of
it
old
decayed
floorboards
and
stuff
of
that
kind
wood
that
was
of
no
use
whatever
except
to
burn
bundy
and
his
mate
were
working
there
and
one
night
misery
came
a
few
minutes
before
half
past
five
and
caught
dawson
in
the
act
of
tying
up
a
small
bundle
of
this
wood
when
hunter
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
he
made
no
attempt
at
prevarication
or
concealment
he
said
he
was
going
to
take
it
home
for
because
it
was
of
no
other
use
misery
kicked
up
a
devil
of
a
row
and
ordered
him
to
leave
the
wood
where
it
was
it
had
to
be
taken
to
the
yard
and
it
was
nothing
to
do
with
dawson
or
anyone
else
whether
it
was
any
use
or
not
if
he
caught
anyone
taking
wood
away
he
would
sack
them
on
the
spot
hunter
shouted
very
loud
so
that
all
the
others
might
hear
and
as
they
were
all
listening
attentively
in
the
next
room
where
they
were
taking
their
aprons
off
preparatory
to
going
home
they
got
the
full
benefit
of
his
remarks
the
following
saturday
when
the
hands
went
to
the
office
for
their
money
they
were
each
presented
with
a
printed
card
bearing
the
following
legend
under
no
circumstances
is
any
article
or
material
however
trifling
to
be
taken
away
by
workmen
for
their
private
use
whether
waste
material
or
not
from
any
workshop
or
place
where
work
is
being
done
foremen
are
hereby
instructed
to
see
that
this
order
is
obeyed
and
to
report
any
such
act
coming
to
their
knowledge
any
man
breaking
this
rule
will
be
either
dismissed
without
notice
or
given
into
custody
rushton
co
most
of
the
men
took
these
cards
with
the
envelopes
containing
their
wages
and
walked
away
without
making
any
comment
in
fact
most
of
them
were
some
distance
away
before
they
realized
exactly
what
the
card
was
about
two
or
three
of
them
stood
a
few
steps
away
from
the
pay
window
in
full
view
of
rushton
and
misery
and
ostentatiously
tore
the
thing
into
pieces
and
threw
them
into
the
street
one
man
remained
at
the
pay
window
while
he
read
the
card
and
then
flung
it
with
an
obscene
curse
into
rushton
face
and
demanded
his
back
day
which
they
gave
him
without
any
remark
or
delay
the
other
men
who
were
not
yet
paid
having
to
wait
while
he
made
out
his
for
that
morning
the
story
of
this
card
spread
all
over
the
place
in
a
very
short
time
it
became
the
talk
of
every
shop
in
the
town
whenever
any
of
rushton
men
encountered
the
employees
of
another
firm
the
latter
used
to
shout
after
them
trifling
or
out
chaps
comes
some
of
rushton
pickpockets
amongst
rushton
men
themselves
it
became
a
standing
joke
or
form
of
greeting
to
say
when
one
met
another
however
trifling
if
one
of
their
number
was
seen
going
home
with
an
unusual
amount
of
paint
or
whitewash
on
his
hands
or
clothes
the
others
would
threaten
to
report
him
for
stealing
the
material
they
used
to
say
that
however
trifling
the
quantity
it
was
against
orders
to
take
it
away
harlow
drew
up
a
list
of
rules
which
he
said
mr
rushton
had
instructed
him
to
communicate
to
the
men
one
of
these
rules
provided
that
everybody
was
to
be
weighed
upon
arrival
at
the
job
in
the
morning
and
again
at
time
any
man
found
to
have
increased
in
weight
was
to
be
discharged
there
was
also
much
cursing
and
covert
resentment
about
it
the
men
used
to
say
that
such
a
thing
as
that
looked
well
coming
from
the
likes
of
rushton
and
hunter
and
they
used
to
remind
each
other
of
the
affair
of
the
console
table
the
barometer
the
venetian
blinds
and
all
the
other
robberies
none
of
them
ever
said
anything
to
either
misery
or
rushton
about
the
cards
but
one
morning
when
the
latter
was
reading
his
letters
at
the
breakfast
table
on
opening
one
of
them
he
found
that
it
contained
one
of
the
notices
smeared
with
human
excrement
he
did
not
eat
any
more
breakfast
that
morning
it
was
not
to
be
much
wondered
at
that
none
of
them
had
the
courage
to
openly
resent
the
conditions
under
which
they
had
to
work
for
although
it
was
summer
there
were
many
men
out
of
employment
and
it
was
much
easier
to
get
the
sack
than
it
was
to
get
another
job
none
of
the
men
were
ever
caught
stealing
anything
however
trifling
but
all
the
same
during
the
course
of
the
summer
five
or
six
of
them
were
captured
by
the
police
and
sent
to
jail
for
not
being
able
to
pay
their
poor
rates
all
through
the
summer
owen
continued
to
make
himself
objectionable
and
to
incur
the
ridicule
of
his
fellow
workmen
by
talking
about
the
causes
of
poverty
and
of
ways
to
abolish
it
most
of
the
men
kept
two
shillings
or
half
a
crown
of
their
wages
back
from
their
wives
for
pocket
money
which
they
spent
on
beer
and
tobacco
there
were
a
very
few
who
spent
a
little
more
than
this
and
there
were
a
still
smaller
number
who
spent
so
much
in
this
way
that
their
families
had
to
suffer
in
consequence
most
of
those
who
kept
back
half
a
crown
or
three
shillings
from
their
wives
did
so
on
the
understanding
that
they
were
to
buy
their
clothing
out
of
it
some
of
them
had
to
pay
a
shilling
a
week
to
a
tallyman
or
credit
clothier
these
were
the
ones
who
indulged
in
shoddy
new
suits
at
long
intervals
others
bought
or
got
their
wives
to
buy
for
them
their
clothes
at
shops
off
about
a
shilling
or
so
a
week
and
not
receiving
the
things
till
they
were
paid
for
there
were
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
who
did
not
spend
even
a
shilling
a
week
for
drink
and
there
were
numerous
others
who
while
not
being
formally
total
abstainers
yet
often
went
for
weeks
together
without
either
entering
a
public
house
or
tasting
intoxicating
drink
in
any
form
then
there
were
others
who
instead
of
drinking
tea
or
coffee
or
cocoa
with
their
dinners
or
suppers
drank
beer
this
did
not
cost
more
than
the
teetotal
drinks
but
all
the
same
there
are
some
persons
who
say
that
those
who
swell
the
drink
bill
by
drinking
beer
with
their
dinners
or
suppers
are
a
kind
of
criminal
and
that
they
ought
to
be
compelled
to
drink
something
else
that
is
if
they
are
working
people
as
for
the
idle
classes
they
of
course
are
to
be
allowed
to
continue
to
make
merry
whisky
wine
and
sherry
to
say
nothing
of
having
their
beer
in
by
the
barrel
and
the
dozen
or
forty
dozen
bottles
but
of
course
that
a
different
matter
because
these
people
make
so
much
money
out
of
the
labour
of
the
working
classes
that
they
can
afford
to
indulge
in
this
way
without
depriving
their
children
of
the
necessaries
of
life
there
is
no
more
cowardly
dastardly
slander
than
is
contained
in
the
assertion
that
the
majority
or
any
considerable
proportion
of
working
men
neglect
their
families
through
drink
it
is
a
condemned
lie
there
are
some
who
do
but
they
are
not
even
a
large
minority
they
are
few
and
far
between
and
are
regarded
with
contempt
by
their
fellow
workmen
it
will
be
said
that
their
families
had
to
suffer
for
want
of
even
the
little
that
most
of
them
spent
in
that
way
but
the
persons
that
use
this
argument
should
carry
it
to
its
logical
conclusion
tea
is
an
unnecessary
and
harmful
drink
it
has
been
condemned
by
medical
men
so
often
that
to
enumerate
its
evil
qualities
here
would
be
waste
of
time
the
same
can
be
said
of
nearly
all
the
cheap
temperance
drinks
they
are
unnecessary
and
harmful
and
cost
money
and
like
beer
are
drunk
only
for
pleasure
what
right
has
anyone
to
say
to
working
men
that
when
their
work
is
done
they
should
not
find
pleasure
in
drinking
a
glass
or
two
of
beer
together
in
a
tavern
or
anywhere
else
let
those
who
would
presume
to
condemn
them
carry
their
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
condemn
pleasure
of
every
kind
let
them
persuade
the
working
classes
to
lead
still
simpler
lives
to
drink
water
instead
of
such
unwholesome
things
as
tea
coffee
beer
lemonade
and
all
the
other
harmful
and
unnecessary
stuff
they
would
then
be
able
to
live
ever
so
much
more
cheaply
and
as
wages
are
always
and
everywhere
regulated
by
the
cost
of
living
they
would
be
able
to
work
for
lower
pay
these
people
are
fond
of
quoting
the
figures
of
the
drink
bill
as
if
all
this
money
were
spent
by
the
working
classes
but
if
the
amount
of
money
spent
in
drink
by
the
the
clergy
and
the
middle
classes
were
deducted
from
the
drink
bill
it
would
be
seen
that
the
amount
spent
per
head
by
the
working
classes
is
not
so
alarming
after
all
and
would
probably
not
be
much
larger
than
the
amount
spent
on
drink
by
those
who
consume
tea
and
coffee
and
all
the
other
unwholesome
and
unnecessary
drinks
the
fact
that
some
of
rushton
men
spent
about
two
shillings
a
week
on
drink
while
they
were
in
employment
was
not
the
cause
of
their
poverty
if
they
had
never
spent
a
farthing
for
drink
and
if
their
wretched
wages
had
been
increased
fifty
percent
they
would
still
have
been
in
a
condition
of
the
most
abject
and
miserable
poverty
for
nearly
all
the
benefits
and
privileges
of
civilization
nearly
everything
that
makes
life
worth
living
would
still
have
been
beyond
their
reach
it
is
inevitable
so
long
as
men
have
to
live
and
work
under
such
heartbreaking
uninteresting
conditions
as
at
present
that
a
certain
proportion
of
them
will
seek
forgetfulness
and
momentary
happiness
in
the
tavern
and
the
only
remedy
for
this
evil
is
to
remove
the
cause
and
while
that
is
in
process
there
is
something
else
that
can
be
done
and
that
is
instead
of
allowing
filthy
drinking
dens
presided
over
by
persons
whose
interest
it
is
to
encourage
men
to
drink
more
bad
beer
than
is
good
for
them
or
than
they
can
afford
to
have
civilized
institutions
run
by
the
state
or
the
municipalities
for
use
and
not
merely
for
profit
decent
pleasure
houses
where
no
drunkenness
or
filthiness
would
be
tolerated
where
one
could
buy
real
beer
or
coffee
or
tea
or
any
other
refreshments
where
men
could
repair
when
their
day
work
was
over
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
rational
intercourse
with
their
fellows
or
listen
to
music
and
singing
taverns
to
which
they
could
take
their
wives
and
children
without
fear
of
defilement
for
a
place
that
is
not
fit
for
the
presence
of
a
woman
or
a
child
is
not
fit
to
exist
at
all
owen
being
a
teetotaller
did
not
spend
any
of
his
money
on
drink
but
he
spent
a
lot
on
what
he
called
cause
every
week
he
bought
some
penny
or
twopenny
pamphlets
or
some
leaflets
about
socialism
which
he
lent
or
gave
to
his
mates
and
in
this
way
and
by
means
of
much
talk
he
succeeded
in
converting
a
few
to
his
party
philpot
harlow
and
a
few
others
used
to
listen
with
interest
and
some
of
them
even
paid
for
the
pamphlets
they
obtained
from
owen
and
after
reading
them
themselves
passed
them
on
to
others
and
also
occasionally
up
arguments
on
their
own
accounts
others
were
simply
indifferent
or
treated
the
subject
as
a
kind
of
joke
ridiculing
the
suggestion
that
it
was
possible
to
abolish
poverty
they
repeated
that
there
had
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
and
there
always
would
be
so
there
was
an
end
of
it
but
the
majority
were
bitterly
hostile
not
to
owen
but
to
socialism
for
the
man
himself
most
of
them
had
a
certain
amount
of
liking
especially
the
ordinary
hands
because
it
was
known
that
he
was
not
a
man
and
that
he
had
declined
to
charge
of
jobs
which
misery
had
offered
to
him
but
to
socialism
they
were
savagely
and
malignantly
opposed
some
of
those
who
had
shown
some
symptoms
of
socialism
during
the
past
winter
when
they
were
starving
had
now
quite
recovered
and
were
stout
defenders
of
the
present
system
barrington
was
still
working
for
the
firm
and
continued
to
maintain
his
manner
of
reserve
seldom
speaking
unless
addressed
but
all
the
same
for
several
reasons
it
began
to
be
rumoured
that
he
shared
views
he
always
paid
for
the
pamphlets
that
owen
gave
him
and
on
one
occasion
when
owen
bought
a
thousand
leaflets
to
give
away
barrington
contributed
a
shilling
towards
the
that
owen
paid
for
them
but
he
never
took
any
part
in
the
arguments
that
sometimes
raged
during
the
or
at
it
was
a
good
thing
for
owen
that
he
had
his
enthusiasm
for
to
occupy
his
mind
socialism
was
to
him
what
drink
was
to
some
of
the
others
the
thing
that
enable
them
to
forget
and
tolerate
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
forced
to
exist
some
of
them
were
so
muddled
with
beer
and
others
so
besotted
with
admiration
of
their
liberal
and
tory
masters
that
they
were
oblivious
of
the
misery
of
their
own
lives
and
in
a
similar
way
owen
was
so
much
occupied
in
trying
to
rouse
them
from
their
lethargy
and
so
engrossed
in
trying
to
think
out
new
arguments
to
convince
them
of
the
possibility
of
bringing
about
an
improvement
in
their
condition
that
he
had
no
time
to
dwell
upon
his
own
poverty
the
money
that
he
spent
on
leaflets
and
pamphlets
to
give
away
might
have
been
better
spent
on
food
and
clothing
for
himself
because
most
of
those
to
whom
he
gave
them
were
by
no
means
grateful
but
he
never
thought
of
that
and
after
all
nearly
everyone
spends
money
on
some
hobby
or
other
some
people
deny
themselves
the
necessaries
or
comforts
of
life
in
order
that
they
may
be
able
to
help
to
fatten
a
publican
others
deny
themselves
in
order
to
enable
a
lazy
parson
to
live
in
idleness
and
luxury
and
others
spend
much
time
and
money
that
they
really
need
for
themselves
in
buying
socialist
literature
to
give
away
to
people
who
do
want
to
know
about
socialism
one
sunday
morning
towards
the
end
of
july
a
band
of
about
men
and
women
on
bicycles
invaded
the
town
two
of
them
who
rode
a
few
yards
in
front
of
the
others
had
affixed
to
the
handlebars
of
each
of
their
machines
a
slender
upright
standard
from
the
top
of
one
of
which
fluttered
a
small
flag
of
crimson
silk
with
brotherhood
and
peace
in
gold
letters
the
other
standard
was
similar
in
size
and
colour
but
with
a
different
legend
for
all
and
all
for
one
as
they
rode
along
they
gave
leaflets
to
the
people
in
the
streets
and
whenever
they
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
many
people
they
dismounted
and
walked
about
giving
their
leaflets
to
whoever
would
accept
them
they
made
several
long
halts
during
their
progress
along
the
grand
parade
where
there
was
a
considerable
crowd
and
then
they
rode
over
the
hill
to
windley
which
they
reached
a
little
before
opening
time
there
were
little
crowds
waiting
outside
the
several
public
houses
and
a
number
of
people
passing
through
the
streets
on
their
way
home
from
church
and
chapel
the
strangers
distributed
leaflets
to
all
those
who
would
take
them
and
they
went
through
a
lot
of
the
side
streets
putting
leaflets
under
the
doors
and
in
the
when
they
had
exhausted
their
stock
they
remounted
and
rode
back
the
way
they
came
meantime
the
news
of
their
arrival
had
spread
and
as
they
returned
through
the
town
they
were
greeted
with
jeers
and
booing
presently
someone
threw
a
stone
and
as
there
happened
to
be
plenty
of
stones
just
there
several
others
followed
suit
and
began
running
after
the
retreating
cyclists
throwing
stones
hooting
and
cursing
the
leaflet
which
had
given
rise
to
all
this
fury
read
as
follows
what
is
socialism
at
present
the
workers
with
hand
and
brain
produce
continually
food
clothing
and
all
useful
and
beautiful
things
in
great
abundance
but
they
labour
in
vain
for
they
are
mostly
poor
and
often
in
want
they
find
it
a
hard
struggle
to
live
their
women
and
children
suffer
and
their
old
age
is
branded
with
pauperism
socialism
is
a
plan
by
which
poverty
will
be
abolished
and
everyone
enabled
to
live
in
plenty
and
comfort
with
leisure
and
opportunity
for
ampler
life
if
you
wish
to
hear
more
of
this
plan
come
to
the
field
at
the
cross
roads
on
the
hill
at
windley
on
tuesday
evening
next
at
and
look
out
for
the
socialist
van
the
cyclists
rode
away
amid
showers
of
stones
without
sustaining
much
damage
one
had
his
hand
cut
and
another
who
happened
to
look
round
was
struck
on
the
forehead
but
these
were
the
only
casualties
on
the
following
tuesday
evening
long
before
the
appointed
time
there
was
a
large
crowd
assembled
at
the
cross
roads
or
the
hill
at
windley
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
the
van
and
they
were
evidently
prepared
to
give
the
socialists
a
warm
reception
there
was
only
one
policeman
in
uniform
there
but
there
were
several
in
plain
clothes
amongst
the
crowd
crass
dick
wantley
the
sawkins
bill
bates
and
several
other
frequenters
of
the
cricketers
were
amongst
the
crowd
and
there
were
also
a
sprinkling
of
tradespeople
including
the
old
dear
and
mr
smallman
the
grocer
and
a
few
ladies
and
gentlemen
wealthy
visitors
but
the
bulk
of
the
crowd
were
working
men
labourers
mechanics
and
boys
as
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
crowd
meant
mischief
many
of
them
had
their
pockets
filled
with
stones
and
were
armed
with
sticks
several
of
the
socialists
were
in
favour
of
going
to
meet
the
van
to
endeavour
to
persuade
those
in
charge
from
coming
and
with
that
object
they
withdrew
from
the
crowd
which
was
already
regarding
them
with
menacing
looks
and
went
down
the
road
in
the
direction
from
which
the
van
was
expected
to
come
they
had
not
gone
very
far
however
before
the
people
divining
what
they
were
going
to
do
began
to
follow
them
and
while
they
were
hesitating
what
course
to
pursue
the
socialist
van
escorted
by
five
or
six
men
on
bicycles
appeared
round
the
corner
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
as
soon
as
the
crowd
saw
it
they
gave
an
exultant
cheer
or
rather
yell
and
began
running
down
the
hill
to
meet
it
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
surrounded
by
a
howling
mob
the
van
was
drawn
by
two
horses
there
was
a
door
and
a
small
platform
at
the
back
and
over
this
was
a
sign
with
white
letters
on
a
red
ground
the
only
hope
of
the
workers
the
driver
pulled
up
and
another
man
on
the
platform
at
the
rear
attempted
to
address
the
crowd
but
his
voice
was
inaudible
in
the
din
of
howls
catcalls
hooting
and
obscene
curses
after
about
an
hour
of
this
as
the
crowd
began
pushing
against
the
van
and
trying
to
overturn
it
the
terrified
horses
commenced
to
get
restive
and
uncontrollable
and
the
man
on
the
box
attempted
to
drive
up
the
hill
this
seemed
to
still
further
infuriate
the
horde
of
savages
who
surrounded
the
van
numbers
of
them
clutched
the
wheels
and
turned
them
the
reverse
way
screaming
that
it
must
go
back
to
where
it
came
from
several
of
them
accordingly
seized
the
horses
heads
and
amid
cheers
turned
them
round
the
man
on
the
platform
was
still
trying
to
make
himself
heard
but
without
success
the
strangers
who
had
come
with
the
van
and
the
little
group
of
local
socialists
who
had
forced
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
gathered
together
close
to
the
platform
in
front
of
the
speaker
only
increased
the
din
by
their
shouts
of
appeal
to
the
crowd
to
the
man
a
fair
chance
this
little
bodyguard
closed
round
the
van
as
it
began
to
move
slowly
downhill
but
they
were
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
protect
it
from
the
crowd
which
not
being
satisfied
with
the
rate
at
which
the
van
was
proceeding
began
to
shout
to
each
other
to
it
away
the
brake
off
and
several
savage
rushes
were
made
with
the
intention
of
putting
these
suggestions
into
execution
some
of
the
defenders
were
hampered
with
their
bicycles
but
they
resisted
as
well
as
they
were
able
and
succeeded
in
keeping
the
crowd
off
until
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
reached
and
then
someone
threw
the
first
stone
which
by
a
strange
chance
happened
to
strike
one
of
the
cyclists
whose
head
was
already
bandaged
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
been
hit
on
the
sunday
this
stone
was
soon
followed
by
others
and
the
man
on
the
platform
was
the
next
to
be
struck
he
got
it
right
on
the
mouth
and
as
he
put
up
his
handkerchief
to
staunch
the
blood
another
struck
him
on
the
forehead
just
above
the
temple
and
he
dropped
forward
on
his
face
on
to
the
platform
as
if
he
had
been
shot
as
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
increased
a
regular
hail
of
stones
fell
upon
the
roof
and
against
the
sides
of
the
van
and
whizzed
past
the
retreating
cyclists
while
the
crowd
followed
close
behind
cheering
shrieking
out
volleys
of
obscene
curses
and
howling
like
wolves
give
the
b
rs
socialism
shouted
crass
who
was
literally
foaming
at
the
mouth
teach
to
come
trying
to
undermined
our
bloody
morality
howled
dick
wantley
as
he
hurled
a
lump
of
granite
that
he
had
torn
up
from
the
macadamized
road
at
one
of
the
cyclists
they
ran
on
after
the
van
until
it
was
out
of
range
and
then
they
bethought
themselves
of
the
local
socialists
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
they
had
prudently
withdrawn
as
soon
as
the
van
had
got
fairly
under
way
and
the
victory
being
complete
the
upholders
of
the
present
system
returned
to
the
piece
of
waste
ground
on
the
top
of
the
hill
where
a
gentleman
in
a
silk
hat
and
frockcoat
stood
up
on
a
little
hillock
and
made
a
speech
he
said
nothing
about
the
distress
committee
or
the
soup
kitchen
or
the
children
who
went
to
school
without
proper
clothes
or
food
and
made
no
reference
to
what
was
to
be
done
next
winter
when
nearly
everybody
would
be
out
of
work
these
were
matters
he
and
they
were
evidently
not
at
all
interested
in
but
he
said
a
good
deal
about
the
glorious
empire
and
the
flag
and
the
royal
family
the
things
he
said
were
received
with
rapturous
applause
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
address
the
crowd
sang
the
national
anthem
with
great
enthusiasm
and
dispersed
congratulating
themselves
that
they
had
shown
to
the
best
of
their
ability
what
mugsborough
thought
of
socialism
and
the
general
opinion
of
the
crowd
was
that
they
would
hear
nothing
more
from
the
socialist
van
but
in
this
they
were
mistaken
for
the
very
next
sunday
evening
a
crowd
of
socialists
suddenly
materialized
at
the
cross
roads
some
of
them
had
come
by
train
others
had
walked
from
different
places
and
some
had
cycled
a
crowd
gathered
and
the
socialists
held
a
meeting
two
speeches
being
delivered
before
the
crowd
recovered
from
their
surprise
at
the
temerity
of
these
other
britishers
who
apparently
had
not
sense
enough
to
understand
that
they
had
been
finally
defeated
and
obliterated
last
tuesday
evening
and
when
the
cyclist
with
the
bandaged
head
got
up
on
the
hillock
some
of
the
crowd
actually
joined
in
the
with
which
the
socialists
greeted
him
in
the
course
of
his
speech
he
informed
them
that
the
man
who
had
come
with
the
van
and
who
had
been
felled
whilst
attempting
to
speak
from
the
platform
was
now
in
hospital
for
some
time
it
had
been
probable
that
he
would
not
recover
but
he
was
now
out
of
danger
and
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
would
come
there
again
upon
this
crass
shouted
out
that
if
ever
the
vanners
did
return
they
would
finish
what
they
had
begun
last
tuesday
he
would
not
get
off
so
easy
next
time
but
when
he
said
this
crass
not
being
able
to
see
into
the
future
did
not
know
what
the
reader
will
learn
in
due
time
that
the
man
was
to
return
to
that
place
under
different
circumstances
when
they
had
finished
their
one
of
the
strangers
who
was
acting
as
chairman
invited
the
audience
to
put
questions
but
as
nobody
wanted
to
ask
any
he
invited
anyone
who
disagreed
with
what
had
been
said
to
get
up
on
the
hillock
and
state
his
objections
so
that
the
audience
might
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
for
themselves
which
side
was
right
but
this
invitation
was
also
neglected
then
the
chairman
announced
that
they
were
coming
there
again
next
sunday
at
the
same
time
when
a
comrade
would
speak
on
and
poverty
the
cause
and
the
remedy
and
then
the
strangers
sang
a
song
called
arise
the
first
verse
being
england
arise
the
long
long
night
is
over
faint
in
the
east
behold
the
dawn
appear
out
of
your
evil
dream
of
toil
and
sorrow
arise
o
england
for
the
day
is
here
during
the
progress
of
the
meeting
several
of
the
strangers
had
been
going
out
amongst
the
crowd
giving
away
leaflets
which
many
of
the
people
gloomily
refused
to
accept
and
selling
penny
pamphlets
of
which
they
managed
to
dispose
of
about
three
dozen
before
declaring
the
meeting
closed
the
chairman
said
that
the
speaker
who
was
coming
next
week
resided
in
london
he
was
not
a
millionaire
but
a
workman
the
same
as
nearly
all
those
who
were
there
present
they
were
not
going
to
pay
him
anything
for
coming
but
they
intended
to
pay
his
railway
fare
therefore
next
sunday
after
the
meeting
there
would
be
a
collection
and
anything
over
the
amount
of
the
fare
would
be
used
for
the
purchase
of
more
leaflets
such
as
those
they
were
now
giving
away
he
hoped
that
anyone
who
thought
that
any
of
the
money
went
into
the
pockets
of
those
who
held
the
meeting
would
come
and
join
then
they
could
have
their
share
the
meeting
now
terminated
and
the
socialists
were
suffered
to
depart
in
peace
some
of
them
however
lingered
amongst
the
crowd
after
the
main
body
had
departed
and
for
a
long
time
after
the
meeting
was
over
little
groups
remained
on
the
field
excitedly
discussing
the
speeches
or
the
leaflets
the
next
sunday
evening
when
the
socialists
came
they
found
the
field
at
the
cross
roads
in
the
possession
of
a
furious
hostile
mob
who
refused
to
allow
them
to
speak
and
finally
they
had
to
go
away
without
having
held
a
meeting
they
came
again
the
next
sunday
and
on
this
occasion
they
had
a
speaker
with
a
very
loud
literally
a
stentorian
voice
and
he
succeeded
in
delivering
an
address
but
as
only
those
who
were
very
close
were
able
to
hear
him
and
as
they
were
all
socialists
it
was
not
of
much
effect
upon
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
they
came
again
the
next
sunday
and
nearly
every
other
sunday
during
the
summer
sometimes
they
were
permitted
to
hold
their
meeting
in
comparative
peace
and
at
other
times
there
was
a
row
they
made
several
converts
and
many
people
declared
themselves
in
favour
of
some
of
the
things
advocated
but
they
were
never
able
to
form
a
branch
of
their
society
there
because
nearly
all
those
who
were
convinced
were
afraid
to
publicly
declare
themselves
lest
they
should
lose
their
employment
or
customers
chapter
the
beano
now
and
then
a
transient
gleam
of
sunshine
penetrated
the
gloom
in
which
the
lives
of
the
philanthropists
were
passed
the
cheerless
monotony
was
sometimes
enlivened
with
a
little
innocent
merriment
every
now
and
then
there
was
a
funeral
which
took
misery
and
crass
away
for
the
whole
afternoon
and
although
they
always
tried
to
keep
the
dates
secret
the
men
generally
knew
when
they
were
gone
sometimes
the
people
in
whose
houses
they
were
working
regaled
them
with
tea
bread
and
butter
cake
or
other
light
refreshments
and
occasionally
even
with
beer
very
different
stuff
from
the
petrifying
liquid
they
bought
at
the
cricketers
for
twopence
a
pint
at
other
places
where
the
people
of
the
house
were
not
so
generously
disposed
the
servants
made
up
for
it
and
entertained
them
in
a
similar
manner
without
the
knowledge
of
their
masters
and
mistresses
even
when
the
mistresses
were
too
cunning
to
permit
of
this
they
were
seldom
able
to
prevent
the
men
from
embracing
the
domestics
who
for
their
part
were
quite
often
willing
to
be
embraced
it
was
an
agreeable
episode
that
helped
to
vary
the
monotony
of
their
lives
and
there
was
no
harm
done
it
was
rather
hard
lines
on
the
philanthropists
sometimes
when
they
happened
to
be
working
in
inhabited
houses
of
the
better
sort
they
always
had
to
go
in
and
out
by
the
back
way
generally
through
the
kitchen
and
the
crackling
and
hissing
of
the
poultry
and
the
joints
of
meat
roasting
in
the
ovens
and
the
odours
of
fruit
pies
and
tarts
and
plum
puddings
and
sage
and
onions
were
simply
maddening
in
the
of
these
houses
there
were
usually
huge
stacks
of
empty
beer
stout
and
wine
bottles
and
others
that
had
contained
whisky
brandy
or
champagne
the
smells
of
the
delicious
viands
that
were
being
prepared
in
the
kitchen
often
penetrated
into
the
dismantled
rooms
that
the
philanthropists
were
renovating
sometimes
just
as
they
were
eating
their
own
wretched
fare
out
of
their
dinner
basket
and
washing
it
down
with
draughts
of
the
cold
tea
or
the
petrifying
liquid
they
sometimes
brought
with
them
in
bottles
sometimes
as
has
been
said
the
people
of
the
house
used
to
send
up
some
tea
and
bread
and
butter
or
cakes
or
other
refreshments
to
the
workmen
but
whenever
hunter
got
to
know
of
it
being
done
he
used
to
speak
to
the
people
about
it
and
request
that
it
be
discontinued
as
it
caused
the
men
to
waste
their
time
but
the
event
of
the
year
was
the
beano
which
took
place
on
the
last
saturday
in
august
after
they
had
been
paying
in
for
about
four
months
the
cost
of
the
outing
was
to
be
five
shillings
a
head
so
this
was
the
amount
each
man
had
to
pay
in
but
it
was
expected
that
the
total
cost
the
hire
of
the
brakes
and
the
cost
of
the
dinner
would
come
out
at
a
trifle
less
than
the
amount
stated
and
in
that
case
the
surplus
would
be
shared
out
after
the
dinner
the
amount
of
the
would
be
greater
or
less
according
to
other
circumstances
for
it
generally
happened
that
apart
from
the
subscriptions
of
the
men
the
beano
fund
was
swelled
by
charitable
donations
from
several
quarters
as
will
be
seen
later
on
when
the
eventful
day
arrived
the
hands
instead
of
working
till
one
were
paid
at
twelve
and
rushed
off
home
to
have
a
wash
and
change
the
brakes
were
to
start
from
the
at
one
but
it
was
arranged
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
lived
at
windley
that
they
were
to
be
picked
up
at
the
cross
roads
at
there
were
four
brakes
altogether
three
large
ones
for
the
men
and
one
small
one
for
the
accommodation
of
mr
rushton
and
a
few
of
his
personal
friends
didlum
grinder
mr
toonarf
an
architect
and
mr
lettum
a
house
and
estate
agent
one
of
the
drivers
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
who
carried
a
long
coachman
horn
this
gentleman
was
not
paid
to
come
but
being
out
of
work
he
thought
that
the
men
would
be
sure
to
stand
him
a
few
drinks
and
that
they
would
probably
make
a
collection
for
him
in
return
for
his
services
most
of
the
chaps
were
smoking
twopenny
cigars
and
had
one
or
two
drinks
with
each
other
to
try
to
cheer
themselves
up
before
they
started
but
all
the
same
it
was
a
melancholy
procession
that
wended
its
way
up
the
hill
to
windley
to
judge
from
the
mournful
expression
on
the
long
face
of
misery
who
sat
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
of
the
first
large
brake
and
the
downcast
appearance
of
the
majority
of
the
men
one
might
have
thought
that
it
was
a
funeral
rather
than
a
pleasure
party
or
that
they
were
a
contingent
of
lost
souls
being
conducted
to
the
banks
of
the
styx
the
man
who
from
time
to
time
sounded
the
coachman
horn
might
have
passed
as
the
angel
sounding
the
last
trump
and
the
fumes
of
the
cigars
were
typical
of
the
smoke
of
their
torment
which
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
a
brief
halt
was
made
at
the
cross
roads
to
pick
up
several
of
the
men
including
philpot
harlow
easton
ned
dawson
sawkins
bill
bates
and
the
the
two
were
now
working
for
smeariton
and
leavit
but
as
they
had
been
paying
in
from
the
first
they
had
elected
to
go
to
the
beano
rather
than
have
their
money
back
the
and
one
or
two
other
habitual
boozers
were
very
shabby
and
down
at
heel
but
the
majority
of
the
men
were
decently
dressed
some
had
taken
their
sunday
clothes
out
of
pawn
especially
for
the
occasion
others
were
arrayed
in
new
suits
which
they
were
going
to
pay
for
at
the
rate
of
a
shilling
a
week
some
had
bought
themselves
suits
one
or
two
were
wearing
their
working
clothes
brushed
and
cleaned
up
and
some
were
wearing
sunday
clothes
that
had
not
been
taken
out
of
pawn
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
pawnbrokers
would
not
take
them
in
these
garments
were
in
what
might
be
called
a
transition
stage
and
shiny
with
wear
but
yet
too
good
to
take
for
working
in
even
if
their
owners
had
been
in
a
position
to
buy
some
others
to
take
their
place
for
best
crass
slyme
and
one
or
two
of
the
single
men
however
were
howling
swells
sporting
collars
and
bowler
hats
of
the
latest
type
in
contradistinction
to
some
of
the
others
who
were
wearing
hats
of
antique
patterns
and
collars
of
various
shapes
with
jagged
edges
harlow
had
on
an
old
straw
hat
that
his
wife
had
cleaned
up
with
oxalic
acid
and
easton
had
carefully
dyed
the
faded
binding
of
his
black
bowler
with
ink
their
boots
were
the
worst
part
of
their
attire
without
counting
rushton
and
his
friends
there
were
men
altogether
including
nimrod
and
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
really
good
boots
amongst
the
whole
crowd
when
all
were
seated
a
fresh
start
was
made
the
small
brake
with
rushton
didlum
grinder
and
two
or
three
other
members
of
the
band
led
the
way
next
came
the
largest
brake
with
misery
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
of
the
third
brake
was
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
crass
occupied
a
similar
position
of
honour
on
the
fourth
brake
on
the
back
step
of
which
was
perched
the
man
with
the
coachman
horn
crass
who
had
engaged
the
brakes
had
arranged
with
the
drivers
that
the
cortege
should
pass
through
the
street
where
he
and
easton
lived
and
as
they
went
by
mrs
crass
was
standing
at
the
door
with
the
two
young
men
lodgers
who
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
shouted
greetings
a
little
further
on
mrs
linden
and
easton
wife
were
standing
at
the
door
to
see
them
go
by
in
fact
the
notes
of
the
coachman
horn
alarmed
most
of
the
inhabitants
who
crowded
to
their
windows
and
doors
to
gaze
upon
the
dismal
procession
as
it
passed
the
mean
streets
of
windley
were
soon
left
far
behind
and
they
found
themselves
journeying
along
a
sunlit
winding
road
bordered
with
hedges
of
hawthorn
holly
and
briar
past
rich
brown
fields
of
standing
corn
shimmering
with
gleams
of
gold
past
where
bending
boughs
were
heavily
loaded
with
mellow
fruits
exhaling
fragrant
odours
through
the
cool
shades
of
lofty
avenues
of
venerable
oaks
whose
overarched
and
interlacing
branches
formed
a
roof
of
green
gilt
and
illuminated
with
quivering
spots
and
shafts
of
sunlight
that
filtered
through
the
trembling
leaves
over
old
mossy
stone
bridges
spanning
limpid
streams
that
duplicated
the
blue
sky
and
the
fleecy
clouds
and
then
again
stretching
away
to
the
horizon
on
every
side
over
more
fields
some
rich
with
harvest
others
filled
with
drowsing
cattle
or
with
flocks
of
timid
sheep
that
scampered
away
at
the
sound
of
the
passing
carriages
several
times
they
saw
merry
little
companies
of
rabbits
frisking
gaily
in
and
out
of
the
hedges
or
in
the
fields
beside
the
sheep
and
cattle
at
intervals
away
in
the
distance
nestling
in
the
hollows
or
amid
sheltering
trees
groups
of
farm
buildings
and
stacks
of
hay
and
further
on
the
square
tower
of
an
ancient
church
or
perhaps
a
solitary
windmill
with
its
revolving
sails
alternately
flashing
and
darkening
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
past
thatched
wayside
cottages
whose
inhabitants
came
out
to
wave
their
hands
in
friendly
greeting
past
groups
of
sunburnt
children
who
climbed
on
fences
and
gates
and
waved
their
hats
and
cheered
or
ran
behind
the
brakes
for
the
pennies
the
men
threw
down
to
them
from
time
to
time
the
men
in
the
brakes
made
attempts
at
singing
but
it
never
came
to
much
because
most
of
them
were
too
hungry
and
miserable
they
had
not
had
time
to
take
any
dinner
and
would
not
have
taken
any
even
if
they
had
the
time
for
they
wished
to
reserve
their
appetites
for
the
banquet
at
the
queen
elizabeth
which
they
expected
to
reach
about
half
past
three
however
they
cheered
up
a
little
after
the
first
halt
at
the
blue
lion
where
most
of
them
got
down
and
had
a
drink
some
of
them
including
the
ned
dawson
bill
bates
and
joe
philpot
had
two
or
three
drinks
and
felt
so
much
happier
for
them
that
shortly
after
they
started
off
again
sounds
of
melody
were
heard
from
the
brake
the
three
first
named
rode
in
the
one
presided
over
by
crass
but
it
was
not
very
successful
and
even
after
the
second
halt
about
five
miles
further
on
at
the
warrior
head
they
found
it
impossible
to
sing
with
any
heartiness
fitful
bursts
of
song
arose
from
time
to
time
from
each
of
the
brakes
in
turn
only
to
die
mournfully
away
it
is
not
easy
to
sing
on
an
empty
stomach
even
if
one
has
got
a
little
beer
in
it
and
so
it
was
with
most
of
them
they
were
not
in
a
mood
to
sing
or
to
properly
appreciate
the
scenes
through
which
they
were
passing
they
wanted
their
dinners
and
that
was
the
reason
why
this
long
ride
instead
of
being
a
pleasure
became
after
a
while
a
weary
journey
that
seemed
as
if
it
were
never
coming
to
an
end
the
next
stop
was
at
the
bird
in
hand
a
wayside
public
house
that
stood
all
by
itself
in
a
lonely
hollow
the
landlord
was
a
fat
man
and
there
were
several
customers
in
the
bar
men
who
looked
like
but
there
were
no
other
houses
to
be
seen
anywhere
this
extraordinary
circumstance
exercised
the
minds
of
our
travellers
and
formed
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
until
they
arrived
at
the
dew
drop
inn
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
first
brake
containing
rushton
and
his
friends
passed
on
without
stopping
here
the
occupants
of
the
second
brake
which
was
only
a
little
way
behind
the
first
were
divided
in
opinion
whether
to
stop
or
go
on
some
shouted
out
to
the
driver
to
pull
up
others
ordered
him
to
proceed
and
more
were
undecided
which
course
to
pursue
a
state
of
mind
that
was
not
shared
by
the
coachman
who
knowing
that
if
they
stopped
somebody
or
other
would
be
sure
to
stand
him
a
drink
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
coming
to
a
decision
but
drew
rein
at
the
inn
an
example
that
was
followed
by
both
the
other
carriages
as
they
drove
up
it
was
a
very
brief
halt
not
more
than
half
the
men
getting
down
at
all
and
those
who
remained
in
the
brakes
grumbled
so
much
at
the
delay
that
the
others
drank
their
beer
as
quickly
as
possible
and
the
journey
was
resumed
once
more
almost
in
silence
no
attempts
at
singing
no
noisy
laughter
they
scarcely
spoke
to
each
other
but
sat
gloomily
gazing
out
over
the
surrounding
country
instructions
had
been
given
to
the
drivers
not
to
stop
again
till
they
reached
the
queen
elizabeth
and
they
therefore
drove
past
the
world
turned
upside
down
without
stopping
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
landlord
of
that
house
who
stood
at
the
door
with
a
sickly
smile
upon
his
face
some
of
those
who
knew
him
shouted
out
that
they
would
give
him
a
call
on
their
way
back
and
with
this
he
had
to
be
content
they
reached
the
queen
elizabeth
at
twenty
minutes
to
four
and
were
immediately
ushered
into
a
large
room
where
a
round
table
and
two
long
ones
were
set
for
dinner
and
they
were
set
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
reputation
of
the
house
the
cloths
that
covered
the
tables
and
the
serviettes
arranged
fanwise
in
the
drinking
glasses
were
literally
as
white
as
snow
and
about
a
dozen
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
were
laid
for
each
person
down
the
centre
of
the
table
glasses
of
delicious
yellow
custard
and
dishes
of
glistening
red
and
golden
jelly
alternated
with
vases
of
flowers
the
floor
of
the
was
covered
with
oilcloth
red
flowers
on
a
pale
yellow
ground
the
pattern
was
worn
off
in
places
but
it
was
all
very
clean
and
shining
whether
one
looked
at
the
walls
with
the
varnished
oak
paper
or
at
the
glossy
piano
standing
across
the
corner
near
the
window
at
the
shining
oak
chairs
or
through
the
open
casement
doors
that
led
into
the
shady
garden
beyond
the
dominating
impression
one
received
was
that
everything
was
exquisitely
clean
the
landlord
announced
that
dinner
would
be
served
in
ten
minutes
and
while
they
were
waiting
some
of
them
indulged
in
a
drink
at
the
bar
just
as
an
appetizer
whilst
the
others
strolled
in
the
garden
or
by
the
landlord
invitation
looked
over
the
house
amongst
other
places
they
glanced
into
the
kitchen
where
the
landlady
was
superintending
the
preparation
of
the
feast
and
in
this
place
with
its
whitewashed
walls
and
floor
as
in
every
other
part
of
the
house
the
same
absolute
cleanliness
reigned
supreme
a
bit
differint
from
the
royal
caff
where
we
got
the
sack
it
remarked
the
to
bill
bates
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
in
response
to
the
announcement
that
dinner
was
ready
arf
replied
bill
rushton
with
didlum
and
grinder
and
his
other
friends
sat
at
the
round
table
near
the
piano
hunter
took
the
head
of
the
longer
of
the
other
two
tables
and
crass
the
foot
and
on
either
side
of
crass
were
bundy
and
slyme
who
had
acted
with
him
as
the
committee
who
had
arranged
the
beano
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
occupied
the
head
of
the
other
table
the
dinner
was
all
that
could
be
desired
it
was
almost
as
good
as
the
kind
of
dinner
that
is
enjoyed
every
day
by
those
persons
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
but
are
cunning
enough
to
make
others
work
for
them
there
was
soup
several
entrees
roast
beef
boiled
mutton
roast
turkey
roast
goose
ham
cabbage
peas
beans
and
sweets
galore
plum
pudding
custard
jelly
fruit
tarts
bread
and
cheese
and
as
much
beer
or
lemonade
as
they
liked
to
pay
for
the
drinks
being
an
extra
and
afterwards
the
waiters
brought
in
cups
of
coffee
for
those
who
desired
it
everything
was
up
to
the
knocker
and
although
they
were
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
multitude
of
knives
and
forks
they
all
with
one
or
two
exceptions
rose
to
the
occasion
and
enjoyed
themselves
famously
the
excellent
decorum
observed
being
marred
only
by
one
or
two
regrettable
incidents
the
first
of
these
occurred
almost
as
soon
as
they
sat
down
when
ned
dawson
who
although
a
big
strong
fellow
was
not
able
to
stand
much
beer
not
being
used
to
it
was
taken
ill
and
had
to
be
escorted
from
the
room
by
his
mate
bundy
and
another
man
they
left
him
somewhere
outside
and
he
came
back
again
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
much
better
but
looking
rather
pale
and
took
his
seat
with
the
others
the
turkeys
the
roast
beef
and
the
boiled
mutton
the
peas
and
beans
and
the
cabbage
disappeared
with
astonishing
rapidity
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
they
were
all
very
hungry
from
the
long
drive
and
nearly
everyone
made
a
point
of
having
at
least
one
helping
of
everything
there
was
to
be
had
some
of
them
went
in
for
two
lots
of
soup
then
for
the
next
course
boiled
mutton
and
ham
or
turkey
then
some
roast
beef
and
goose
then
a
little
more
boiled
mutton
with
a
little
roast
beef
each
of
the
three
boys
devoured
several
times
his
own
weight
of
everything
to
say
nothing
of
numerous
bottles
of
lemonade
and
champagne
ginger
beer
crass
frequently
paused
to
mop
the
perspiration
from
his
face
and
neck
with
his
serviette
in
fact
everybody
had
a
good
time
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
of
everything
to
eat
the
beer
was
of
the
best
and
all
the
time
amid
the
rattle
of
the
crockery
and
the
knives
and
forks
the
proceedings
were
enlivened
by
many
jests
and
flashes
of
wit
that
continuously
kept
the
table
in
a
roar
us
over
another
dollop
of
that
there
white
stuff
bob
shouted
the
to
crass
indicating
the
blancmange
crass
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
hold
of
the
dish
containing
the
stuff
but
instead
of
passing
it
to
the
he
proceeded
to
demolish
it
himself
gobbling
it
up
quickly
directly
from
the
dish
with
a
spoon
you
eating
it
all
yerself
yer
bleeder
cried
the
indignantly
as
soon
as
he
realized
what
was
happening
all
right
matey
replied
crass
affably
as
he
deposited
the
empty
dish
on
the
table
do
matter
there
plenty
more
where
it
come
from
tell
the
landlord
to
bring
in
another
lot
upon
being
applied
to
the
landlord
who
was
assisted
by
his
daughter
two
other
young
women
and
two
young
men
brought
in
several
more
lots
and
so
the
was
appeased
as
for
the
it
was
a
fair
just
like
christmas
but
as
ned
dawson
and
bill
bates
had
drunk
all
the
sauce
before
the
pudding
was
served
they
all
had
to
have
their
first
helping
without
any
however
as
the
landlord
brought
in
another
lot
shortly
afterwards
that
did
matter
either
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
crass
rose
to
make
his
statement
as
secretary
men
had
paid
five
shillings
each
that
made
nine
pounds
five
shillings
the
committee
had
decided
that

especially
those
who

spent
nearly
all
their

when
this
ceremony
was
completed
philpot
moved
a
hearty
vote
of
thanks
to
the
committee
for
the
manner
in
which
they
had
carried
out
their
duties

mr

requested
the
landlord
to
serve
drinks
and
cigars

round
some
had
cigarettes
and
the
teetotallers
had
lemonade

ginger
beer
those
who

took

all
the
same
and
gave
it
to
someone
else
who
did
when
all
were
supplied
there
suddenly
arose
loud
cries
of
and
it
was
seen
that
hunter
was
upon
his
feet
as
soon
as
silence
was
obtained
misery
said
that
he
believed
that
everyone
there
present
would
agree
with
him
when
he
said
that
they
should
not
let
the
occasion
pass
without
drinking
the
of
their
esteemed
and
respected
employer
mr
rushton
hear
hear
some
of
them
had
worked
for
mr
rushton
on
and
off
for
many
years
and
as
far
as
they
was
concerned
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
hunter
to
say
much
in
praise
of
mr
rushton
hear
hear
they
knew
mr
rushton
as
well
as
he
did
himself
and
to
know
him
was
to
esteem
him
cheers
as
for
the
new
hands
although
they
did
not
know
mr
rushton
as
well
as
the
old
hands
did
he
felt
sure
that
they
would
agree
that
as
no
one
could
wish
for
a
better
master
loud
applause
he
had
much
pleasure
in
asking
them
to
drink
mr
rushton
health
everyone
rose
honours
chaps
shouted
crass
waving
his
glass
and
leading
off
the
singing
which
was
immediately
joined
in
with
great
enthusiasm
by
most
of
the
men
the
conducting
the
music
with
a
table
knife
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
and
so
say
all
of
us
so
so
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
a
jolly
good
and
so
say
all
of
us
three
cheers
shouted
crass
leading
off
hip
hip
hip
hooray
hip
hip
hip
hooray
hip
hip
hip
hooray
everyone
present
drank
rushton
health
or
at
any
rate
went
through
the
motions
of
doing
so
but
during
the
roar
of
cheering
and
singing
that
preceded
it
several
of
the
men
stood
with
expressions
of
contempt
or
uneasiness
upon
their
faces
silently
watching
the
enthusiasts
or
looking
at
the
ceiling
or
on
the
floor
will
say
this
much
remarked
the
semidrunk
as
they
all
resumed
their
seats
he
had
had
several
drinks
during
dinner
besides
those
he
had
taken
on
the
journey
i
will
say
this
much
although
i
did
have
a
little
misunderstanding
with
mr
hunter
when
i
was
workin
at
the
royal
caff
i
must
admit
that
this
is
the
best
firm
that
ever
worked
under
me
this
statement
caused
a
shout
of
laughter
which
however
died
away
as
mr
rushton
rose
to
acknowledge
the
toast
to
his
health
he
said
that
he
had
now
been
in
business
for
nearly
sixteen
years
and
this
was
he
believed
the
eleventh
outing
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
attending
during
all
that
time
the
business
had
steadily
progressed
and
had
increased
in
volume
from
year
to
year
and
he
hoped
and
believed
that
the
progress
made
in
the
past
would
be
continued
in
the
future
hear
hear
of
course
he
realized
that
the
success
of
the
business
depended
very
largely
upon
the
men
as
well
as
upon
himself
he
did
his
best
in
trying
to
get
work
for
them
and
it
was
necessary
if
the
business
was
to
go
on
and
prosper
that
they
should
also
do
their
best
to
get
the
work
done
when
he
had
secured
it
for
them
hear
hear
the
masters
could
not
do
without
the
men
and
the
men
could
not
live
without
the
masters
hear
hear
it
was
a
matter
of
division
of
labour
the
men
worked
with
their
hands
and
the
masters
worked
with
their
brains
and
one
was
no
use
without
the
other
he
hoped
the
good
feeling
which
had
hitherto
existed
between
himself
and
his
workmen
would
always
continue
and
he
thanked
them
for
the
way
in
which
they
had
responded
to
the
toast
of
his
health
loud
cheers
greeted
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
and
then
crass
stood
up
and
said
that
he
begged
to
propose
the
health
of
mr
hear
hear
he
was
going
to
make
a
long
speech
as
he
was
much
of
a
speaker
cries
of
all
right
on
etc
but
he
felt
sure
as
they
would
all
hagree
with
him
when
he
said
that
next
to
mr
rushton
there
was
no
one
the
men
had
more
respect
and
liking
for
than
mr
cheers
a
few
weeks
ago
when
mr
was
laid
up
many
of
them
began
to
be
afraid
as
they
was
going
to
lose
he
was
sure
that
all
the
was
glad
to
this
hoppertunity
of
congratulating
him
on
his
recovery
hear
hear
and
of
wishing
him
the
best
of
in
the
future
and
hoping
as
he
would
be
spared
to
come
to
a
good
many
more
beanos
loud
applause
greeted
the
conclusion
of
crass
remarks
and
once
more
the
meeting
burst
into
song
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
so
say
all
of
us
so
so
when
they
had
done
cheering
nimrod
rose
his
voice
trembled
a
little
as
he
thanked
them
for
their
kindness
and
said
that
he
hoped
he
deserved
their
goodwill
he
could
only
say
that
as
he
was
sure
as
he
always
tried
to
be
fair
and
considerate
to
everyone
cheers
he
would
now
request
the
landlord
to
replenish
their
glasses
hear
hear
as
soon
as
the
drinks
were
served
nimrod
again
rose
and
said
he
wished
to
propose
the
healths
of
their
visitors
who
had
so
kindly
contributed
to
their
expenses
mr
lettum
mr
didlum
mr
toonarf
and
mr
grinder
cheers
they
were
very
pleased
and
proud
to
see
them
there
hear
hear
and
he
was
sure
the
men
would
agree
with
him
when
he
said
that
messrs
lettum
didlum
toonarf
and
grinder
were
jolly
good
fellows
to
judge
from
the
manner
in
which
they
sang
the
chorus
and
cheered
it
was
quite
evident
that
most
of
the
hands
did
agree
when
they
left
off
grinder
rose
to
reply
on
behalf
of
those
included
in
the
toast
he
said
that
it
gave
them
much
pleasure
to
be
there
and
take
part
in
such
pleasant
proceedings
and
they
were
glad
to
think
that
they
had
been
able
to
help
to
bring
it
about
it
was
very
gratifying
to
see
the
good
feeling
that
existed
between
mr
rushton
and
his
workmen
which
was
as
it
should
be
because
masters
and
men
was
really
fellow
workers
the
masters
did
the
brain
work
the
men
the
work
they
was
both
workers
and
their
interests
was
the
same
he
liked
to
see
men
doing
their
best
for
their
master
and
knowing
that
their
master
was
doing
his
best
for
them
that
he
was
not
only
a
master
but
a
friend
that
was
what
he
grinder
liked
to
see
master
and
men
pulling
together
doing
their
best
and
realizing
that
their
interests
was
identical
cheers
if
only
all
masters
and
men
would
do
this
they
would
find
that
everything
would
go
on
all
right
there
would
be
more
work
and
less
poverty
let
the
men
do
their
best
for
their
masters
and
the
masters
do
their
best
for
their
men
and
they
would
find
that
that
was
the
true
solution
of
the
social
problem
and
not
the
silly
nonsense
that
was
talked
by
people
what
went
about
with
red
flags
cheers
and
laughter
most
of
those
fellows
were
chaps
who
was
too
lazy
to
work
for
their
livin
hear
hear
they
could
take
it
from
him
that
if
ever
the
socialists
got
the
upper
hand
there
would
just
be
a
few
of
the
hartful
dodgers
who
would
get
all
the
cream
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
but
work
for
the
rest
hear
hear
that
wot
hall
those
hagitators
was
after
they
wanted
them
his
hearers
to
work
and
keep
in
idleness
hear
hear
on
behalf
of
mr
didlum
mr
toonarf
mr
lettum
and
himself
he
thanked
them
for
their
good
wishes
and
hoped
to
be
with
them
on
a
occasion
in
the
future
loud
cheers
greeted
the
termination
of
his
speech
but
it
was
obvious
from
some
of
the
men
faces
that
they
resented
grinder
remarks
these
men
ridiculed
socialism
and
regularly
voted
for
the
continuance
of
capitalism
and
yet
they
were
disgusted
and
angry
with
grinder
there
was
also
a
small
number
of
socialists
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
altogether
who
did
not
join
in
the
applause
these
men
were
all
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
presided
over
by
payne
none
of
them
had
joined
in
the
applause
that
greeted
the
speeches
and
so
far
neither
had
they
made
any
protest
some
of
them
turned
very
red
as
they
listened
to
the
concluding
sentences
of
grinder
oration
and
others
laughed
but
none
of
them
said
anything
they
knew
before
they
came
that
there
was
sure
to
be
a
lot
of
good
fellow
business
and
speechmaking
and
they
had
agreed
together
beforehand
to
take
no
part
one
way
or
the
other
and
to
refrain
from
openly
dissenting
from
anything
that
might
be
said
but
they
had
not
anticipated
anything
quite
so
strong
as
this
when
grinder
sat
down
some
of
those
who
had
applauded
him
began
to
jeer
at
the
socialists
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
they
shouted
up
against
yer
ai
got
nothing
to
say
now
do
some
of
you
get
up
and
make
a
speech
this
last
appeared
to
be
a
very
good
idea
to
those
liberals
and
tories
who
had
not
liked
grinder
observations
so
they
all
began
to
shout
on
get
up
and
make
a
speech
a
man
and
so
on
several
of
those
who
had
been
loudest
in
applauding
grinder
also
joined
in
the
demand
that
owen
should
make
a
speech
because
they
were
certain
that
grinder
and
the
other
gentlemen
would
be
able
to
dispose
of
all
his
arguments
but
owen
and
the
other
socialists
made
no
response
except
to
laugh
so
presently
crass
tied
a
white
handkerchief
on
a
cane
that
belonged
to
mr
didlum
and
stuck
it
in
the
vase
of
flowers
that
stood
on
the
end
of
the
table
where
the
socialist
group
were
sitting
when
the
noise
had
in
some
measure
ceased
grinder
again
rose
i
made
the
few
remarks
that
i
did
i
did
know
as
there
was
any
socialists
i
could
tell
from
the
look
of
you
that
most
of
you
had
more
sense
at
the
same
time
i
rather
glad
i
said
what
i
did
because
it
just
shows
you
what
sort
of
chaps
these
socialists
are
they
pretty
artful
they
know
when
to
talk
and
when
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
what
they
like
is
to
get
hold
of
a
few
ignorant
men
in
a
workshop
or
a
public
house
and
then
they
can
talk
by
the
mile
shop
lawyers
you
know
wot
i
mean
i
right
and
everybody
else
is
wrong
laughter
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
i
mean
when
they
finds
theirselves
in
the
company
of
edicated
people
wot
knows
a
little
more
than
they
does
theirselves
and
who
likely
to
be
misled
by
a
lot
of
claptrap
why
then
mum
the
word
so
next
time
you
hears
any
of
these
shop
lawyers
arguments
you
know
how
much
it
worth
most
of
the
men
were
delighted
with
this
speech
which
was
received
with
much
laughing
and
knocking
on
the
tables
they
remarked
to
each
other
that
grinder
was
a
smart
man
he
got
the
socialists
weighed
up
just
about
right
to
an
ounce
then
it
was
seen
that
barrington
was
on
his
feet
facing
grinder
and
a
sudden
silence
fell
may
or
may
not
be
true
began
barrington
socialists
always
know
when
to
speak
and
when
to
keep
silent
but
the
present
occasion
hardly
seemed
a
suitable
one
to
discuss
such
subjects
are
here
today
as
friends
and
want
to
forget
our
differences
and
enjoy
ourselves
for
a
few
hours
but
after
what
mr
grinder
has
said
i
am
quite
ready
to
reply
to
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
fact
that
i
am
a
socialist
and
that
i
am
here
today
as
one
of
mr
rushton
employees
should
be
an
answer
to
the
charge
that
socialists
are
too
lazy
to
work
for
their
living
and
as
to
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
and
simplicity
of
working
men
and
trying
to
mislead
them
with
nonsensical
claptrap
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
point
if
mr
grinder
had
taken
some
particular
socialist
doctrine
and
had
proved
it
to
be
untrue
or
misleading
instead
of
adopting
the
cowardly
method
of
making
vague
general
charges
that
he
can
not
substantiate
he
would
find
it
far
more
difficult
to
do
that
than
it
would
be
for
a
socialist
to
show
that
most
of
what
mr
grinder
himself
has
been
telling
us
is
nonsensical
claptrap
of
the
most
misleading
kind
he
tells
us
that
the
employers
work
with
their
brains
and
the
men
with
their
hands
if
it
is
true
that
no
brains
are
required
to
do
manual
labour
why
put
idiots
into
imbecile
asylums
why
not
let
them
do
some
of
the
hand
work
for
which
no
brains
are
required
as
they
are
idiots
they
would
probably
be
willing
to
work
for
even
less
than
the
ideal
living
wage
if
mr
grinder
had
ever
tried
he
would
know
that
manual
workers
have
to
concentrate
their
minds
and
their
attention
on
their
work
or
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
it
at
all
his
talk
about
employers
being
not
only
the
masters
but
the
friends
of
their
workmen
is
also
mere
claptrap
because
he
knows
as
well
as
we
do
that
no
matter
how
good
or
benevolent
an
employer
may
be
no
matter
how
much
he
might
desire
to
give
his
men
good
conditions
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
do
so
because
he
has
to
compete
against
other
employers
who
do
not
do
that
it
is
the
bad
employer
the
sweating
employer
who
sets
the
pace
and
the
others
have
to
adopt
the
same
methods
very
often
against
their
inclinations
or
they
would
not
be
able
to
compete
with
him
if
any
employer
today
were
to
resolve
to
pay
his
workmen
not
less
wages
than
he
would
be
able
to
live
upon
in
comfort
himself
that
he
would
not
require
them
to
do
more
work
in
a
day
than
he
himself
would
like
to
perform
every
day
of
his
own
life
mr
grinder
knows
as
well
as
we
do
that
such
an
employer
would
be
bankrupt
in
a
month
because
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
any
work
except
by
taking
it
at
the
same
price
as
the
sweaters
and
the
also
tells
us
that
the
interests
of
masters
and
men
are
identical
but
if
an
employer
has
a
contract
it
is
to
his
interest
to
get
the
work
done
as
soon
as
possible
the
sooner
it
is
done
the
more
profit
he
will
make
but
the
more
quickly
it
is
done
the
sooner
will
the
men
be
out
of
employment
how
then
can
it
be
true
that
their
interests
are
identical
let
us
suppose
that
an
employer
is
say
thirty
years
of
age
when
he
commences
business
and
that
he
carries
it
on
for
twenty
years
let
us
assume
that
he
employs
forty
men
more
or
less
regularly
during
that
period
and
that
the
average
age
of
these
men
is
also
thirty
years
at
the
time
the
employer
commences
business
at
the
end
of
the
twenty
years
it
usually
happens
that
the
employer
has
made
enough
money
to
enable
him
to
live
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
ease
and
comfort
but
what
about
the
workman
all
through
those
twenty
years
they
have
earned
but
a
bare
living
wage
and
have
had
to
endure
such
privations
that
those
who
are
not
already
dead
are
broken
in
health
the
case
of
the
employer
there
had
been
twenty
years
of
steady
progress
towards
ease
and
leisure
and
independence
in
the
case
of
the
majority
of
the
men
there
were
twenty
years
of
deterioration
twenty
years
of
steady
continuous
and
hopeless
progress
towards
physical
and
mental
inefficiency
towards
the
the
and
premature
death
what
is
it
but
false
misleading
nonsensical
claptrap
to
say
that
their
interests
were
identical
with
those
of
their
employer
talk
as
that
is
not
likely
to
deceive
any
but
children
or
fools
we
are
not
children
but
it
is
very
evident
that
mr
grinder
thinks
that
we
are
fools
it
happens
through
one
or
more
of
a
hundred
different
circumstances
over
which
he
has
no
control
or
through
some
error
of
judgement
that
after
many
years
of
laborious
mental
work
an
employer
is
overtaken
by
misfortune
and
finds
himself
no
better
and
even
worse
off
than
when
he
started
but
these
are
exceptional
cases
and
even
if
he
becomes
absolutely
bankrupt
he
is
no
worse
off
than
the
majority
of
the
workmen
the
same
time
it
is
quite
true
that
the
real
interests
of
employers
and
workmen
are
the
same
but
not
in
the
sense
that
mr
grinder
would
have
us
believe
under
the
existing
system
of
society
but
a
very
few
people
no
matter
how
well
off
they
may
be
can
be
certain
that
they
or
their
children
will
not
eventually
come
to
want
and
even
those
who
think
they
are
secure
themselves
find
their
happiness
diminished
by
the
knowledge
of
the
poverty
and
misery
that
surrounds
them
on
every
side
that
sense
only
is
it
true
that
the
interests
of
masters
and
men
are
identical
for
it
is
to
the
interest
of
all
both
rich
and
poor
to
help
to
destroy
a
system
that
inflicts
suffering
upon
the
many
and
allows
true
happiness
to
none
it
is
to
the
interest
of
all
to
try
and
find
a
better
way
here
crass
jumped
up
and
interrupted
shouting
out
that
they
come
there
to
listen
to
a
lot
of
speechmaking
a
remark
that
was
greeted
with
unbounded
applause
by
most
of
those
present
loud
cries
of
hear
resounded
through
the
room
and
the
suggested
that
someone
should
sing
a
song
the
men
who
had
clamoured
for
a
speech
from
owen
said
nothing
and
mr
grinder
who
had
been
feeling
rather
uncomfortable
was
secretly
very
glad
of
the
interruption
the
suggestion
that
someone
should
sing
a
song
was
received
with
unqualified
approbation
by
everybody
including
barrington
and
the
other
socialists
who
desired
nothing
better
than
that
the
time
should
be
passed
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
occasion
the
landlord
daughter
a
rosy
girl
of
about
twenty
years
of
age
in
a
pink
print
dress
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
the
taking
his
place
at
the
side
of
the
instrument
and
facing
the
audience
sang
the
first
song
with
appropriate
gestures
the
chorus
being
rendered
enthusiastically
by
the
full
strength
of
the
company
including
misery
who
by
this
time
was
slightly
drunk
from
drinking
gin

ginger

bush
bush
protracted
knocking
on
the
tables
greeted
the
end
of
the
song
but
as
the
knew
no
other
except
odd
verses
and
choruses
he
called
upon
crass
for
the
next
and
that
gentleman
accordingly
sang
boys
work
to
the
tune
of
tramp
tramp
the
boys
are
marching
as
this
song
is
the
marseillaise
of
the
tariff
reform
party
voicing
as
it
does
the
highest
ideals
of
the
tory
workmen
of
this
country
it
was
an
unqualified
success
for
most
of
them
were
conservatives
i
not
a
wealthy
man
but
i
lives
upon
a
plan
wot
will
render
me
as
as
a
king
an
if
you
will
allow
i
sing
it
to
you
now
for

always
on
the
wing
work
boys
work
and
be
contented
so
long
as
you
enough
to
buy
a
meal
for
if
you
will
but
try
you
be
wealthy
bye
and
bye
if
you
only
put
yer
shoulder
to
the
wheel
boys
shouted
grinder
who
was
a
strong
tariff
reformer
and
was
delighted
to
see
that
most
of
the
men
were
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
the
roared
out
the
chorus
once
more
work
boys
work
and
be
contented
so
long
as
you
enough
to
buy
a
meal
for
if
you
will
but
try
you
be
wealthy
bye
and
bye
if
you
only
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
as
they
sang
the
words
of
this
noble
chorus
the
tories
seemed
to
become
inspired
with
lofty
enthusiasm
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
for
certain
but
probably
as
they
sang
there
arose
before
their
exalted
imaginations
a
vision
of
the
past
and
looking
down
the
long
vista
of
the
years
that
were
gone
they
saw
that
from
their
childhood
they
had
been
years
of
poverty
and
joyless
toil
they
saw
their
fathers
and
mothers
weaned
and
broken
with
privation
and
excessive
labour
sinking
unhonoured
into
the
welcome
oblivion
of
the
grave
and
then
as
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
their
dream
they
saw
the
future
with
their
own
children
travelling
along
the
same
weary
road
to
the
same
kind
of
goal
it
is
possible
that
visions
of
this
character
were
conjured
up
in
their
minds
by
the
singing
for
the
words
of
the
song
gave
expression
to
their
ideal
of
what
human
life
should
be
that
was
all
they
wanted
to
be
allowed
to
work
like
brutes
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
they
did
not
want
to
be
civilized
themselves
and
they
intended
to
take
good
care
that
the
children
they
had
brought
into
the
world
should
never
enjoy
the
benefits
of
civilization
either
as
they
often
said
and
what
are
our
children
that
they
should
be
made
to
work
for
their
betters
they
not
gentry
children
are
they
the
good
things
of
life
was
never
meant
for
the
likes
of
them
let
work
that
wot
the
likes
of
them
was
made
for
and
if
we
can
only
get
tariff
reform
for
they
will
always
be
sure
of
plenty
of
it
not
only
full
time
but
overtime
as
for
edication
travellin
in
parts
an
enjoying
life
an
all
sich
things
as
that
they
was
never
meant
for
the
likes
of
our
children
they
meant
for
children
our
children
is
only
like
so
much
dirt
compared
with
gentry
children
that
wot
the
likes
of
us
is
made
for
to
work
for
gentry
so
as
they
can
plenty
of
time
to
enjoy
theirselves
and
the
gentry
is
made
to
a
good
time
so
as
the
likes
of
us
can
plenty
of
work
there
were
several
more
verses
and
by
the
time
they
had
sung
them
all
the
tories
were
in
a
state
of
wild
enthusiasm
even
ned
dawson
who
had
fallen
asleep
with
his
head
pillowed
on
his
arms
on
the
table
roused
himself
up
at
the
end
of
each
verse
and
after
having
joined
in
the
chorus
went
to
sleep
again
at
the
end
of
the
song
they
gave
three
cheers
for
tariff
reform
and
plenty
of
work
and
then
crass
who
as
the
singer
of
the
last
song
had
the
right
to
call
upon
the
next
man
nominated
philpot
who
received
an
ovation
when
he
stood
up
for
he
was
a
general
favourite
he
never
did
no
harm
to
nobody
and
he
was
always
wiling
to
do
anyone
a
good
turn
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
shouts
of
old
resounded
through
the
room
as
he
crossed
over
to
the
piano
and
in
response
to
numerous
requests
for
old
song
he
began
to
sing
flower
show
walkin
out
the
other
night
not
knowing
where
to
go
i
saw
a
bill
upon
a
wall
about
a
flower
show
so
i
thought
the
flowers
i
go
and
see
to
pass
away
the
night
and
when
i
got
into
that
show
it
was
a
curious
sight
so
with
your
kind
intention
and
a
little
of
your
aid
tonight
some
flowers
i
mention
which
i
hope
will
never
fade
omnes
some
flowers
i
mention
which
i
hope
will
never
fade
there
were
several
more
verses
from
which
it
appeared
that
the
principal
flowers
in
the
show
were
the
rose
the
thistle
and
the
shamrock
when
he
had
finished
the
applause
was
so
deafening
and
the
demands
for
an
encore
so
persistent
that
to
satisfy
them
he
sang
another
old
favourite
you
buy
my
pretty
flowers
coming
ever
going
men
and
women
hurry
by
heedless
of
the
gleaming
in
her
sad
and
wistful
eye
how
her
little
heart
is
sighing
thro
the
cold
and
dreary
hours
only
listen
to
her
crying
wo
you
buy
my
pretty
flowers
when
the
last
verse
of
this
sang
had
been
sung
five
er
six
times
philpot
exercised
his
right
of
nominating
the
next
singer
and
called
upon
dick
wantley
who
with
many
suggestive
gestures
and
grimaces
sang
me
amongst
the
girls
and
afterwards
called
upon
payne
the
foreman
carpenter
who
gave
the
marquis
of
camberwell
green
there
was
a
lot
of
what
artists
call
attached
to
his
song
and
as
he
proceeded
payne
who
was
ghastly
pale
and
very
nervous
went
through
a
lot
of
galvanic
motions
and
gestures
bowing
and
scraping
and
sliding
about
and
flourishing
his
handkerchief
in
imitation
of
the
courtly
graces
of
the
marquis
during
this
performance
the
audience
maintained
an
appalling
silence
which
so
embarrassed
payne
that
before
he
was
through
the
song
he
had
to
stop
because
he
could
not
remember
the
rest
however
to
make
up
for
this
failure
he
sang
another
called
all
must
die
like
the
fire
in
the
grate
this
also
was
received
in
a
very
lukewarm
manner
by
the
crowd
same
of
whom
laughed
and
others
suggested
that
if
he
sing
any
better
than
that
the
sooner
he
was
dead
the
better
this
was
followed
by
another
tory
ballad
the
chorus
being
as
follows
his
clothes
may
be
ragged
his
hands
may
be
soiled
but
where
the
disgrace
if
for
bread
he
has
toiled
his
is
in
the
right
place
deny
it
no
one
can
the
backbone
of
old
england
is
the
honest
workin
man
after
a
few
more
songs
it
was
decided
to
adjourn
to
a
field
at
the
rear
of
the
tavern
to
have
a
game
of
cricket
sides
were
formed
rushton
didlum
grinder
and
the
other
gentlemen
taking
part
just
as
if
they
were
only
common
people
and
while
the
game
was
in
progress
the
rest
played
ring
quoits
or
reclined
on
the
grass
watching
the
players
whilst
the
remainder
amused
themselves
drinking
beer
and
playing
cards
and
in
the
bar
parlour
or
taking
walks
around
the
village
sampling
the
beer
at
the
other
pubs
of
which
there
were
three
the
time
passed
in
this
manner
until
seven
the
hour
at
which
it
had
been
arranged
to
start
on
the
return
journey
but
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
they
set
out
an
unpleasant
incident
occurred
during
the
time
that
they
were
playing
cricket
a
party
of
glee
singers
consisting
of
four
young
girls
and
five
men
three
of
whom
were
young
fellows
the
other
two
being
rather
elderly
possibly
the
fathers
of
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
party
came
into
the
field
and
sang
several
part
songs
for
their
entertainment
towards
the
close
of
the
game
most
of
the
men
had
assembled
in
this
field
and
during
a
pause
in
the
singing
the
musicians
sent
one
of
their
number
a
shy
girl
about
eighteen
years
of
age
who
seemed
as
if
she
would
rather
that
someone
else
had
the
task
amongst
the
crowd
to
make
a
collection
the
girl
was
very
nervous
and
blushed
as
she
murmured
her
request
and
held
out
a
straw
hat
that
evidently
belonged
to
one
of
the
male
members
of
the
glee
party
a
few
of
the
men
gave
pennies
some
refused
or
pretended
not
to
see
either
the
girl
or
the
hat
others
offered
to
give
her
some
money
for
a
kiss
but
what
caused
the
trouble
was
that
two
or
three
of
those
who
had
been
drinking
more
than
was
good
for
them
dropped
the
still
burning
ends
of
their
cigars
all
wet
with
saliva
as
they
were
into
the
hat
and
dick
wantley
spit
into
it
the
girl
hastily
returned
to
her
companions
and
as
she
went
some
of
the
men
who
had
witnessed
the
behaviour
of
those
who
had
insulted
her
advised
them
to
make
themselves
scarce
as
they
stood
a
good
chance
of
getting
a
thrashing
from
the
girl
friends
they
said
it
would
serve
them
dam
well
right
if
they
did
get
a
hammering
partly
sobered
by
fear
the
three
culprits
sneaked
off
and
hid
themselves
pale
and
trembling
with
terror
under
the
box
seats
of
the
three
brakes
they
had
scarcely
left
when
the
men
of
the
glee
party
came
running
up
furiously
demanding
to
see
those
who
had
insulted
the
girl
as
they
could
get
no
satisfactory
answer
one
of
their
number
ran
back
and
presently
returned
bringing
the
girl
with
him
the
other
young
women
following
a
little
way
behind
she
said
she
could
not
see
the
men
they
were
looking
for
so
they
went
down
to
the
public
house
to
see
if
they
could
find
them
there
some
of
the
rushton
men
accompanying
them
and
protesting
their
indignation
the
time
passed
quickly
enough
and
by
half
past
seven
the
brakes
were
loaded
up
again
and
a
start
made
for
the
return
journey
they
called
at
all
the
taverns
on
the
road
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
blue
lion
half
of
them
were
three
sheets
in
the
wind
and
five
or
six
were
very
drunk
including
the
driver
of
crass
brake
and
the
man
with
the
bugle
the
latter
was
so
far
gone
that
they
had
to
let
him
lie
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
amongst
their
feet
where
he
fell
asleep
while
the
others
amused
themselves
by
blowing
weird
shrieks
out
of
the
horn
there
was
an
automatic
piano
at
the
blue
lion
and
as
that
was
the
last
house
of
the
road
they
made
a
rather
long
stop
there
playing
hooks
and
rings
drinking
singing
dancing
and
finally
quarrelling
several
of
them
seemed
disposed
to
quarrel
with
newman
all
sorts
of
offensive
remarks
were
made
at
him
in
his
hearing
once
someone
ostentatiously
knocked
his
glass
of
lemonade
over
and
a
little
later
someone
else
collided
violently
with
him
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
causing
his
lemonade
to
spill
all
over
his
clothes
the
worst
of
it
was
that
most
of
these
rowdy
ones
were
his
fellow
passengers
in
crass
brake
and
there
was
not
much
chance
of
getting
a
seat
in
either
of
the
other
carriages
for
they
were
overcrowded
already
from
the
remarks
he
overheard
from
time
to
time
newman
guessed
the
reason
of
their
hostility
and
as
their
manner
towards
him
grew
more
menacing
he
became
so
nervous
that
he
began
to
think
of
quietly
sneaking
off
and
walking
the
remainder
of
the
way
home
by
himself
unless
he
could
get
somebody
in
one
of
the
other
brakes
to
change
seats
with
him
whilst
these
thoughts
were
agitating
his
mind
dick
wantley
suddenly
shouted
out
that
he
was
going
to
go
for
the
dirty
tyke
who
had
offered
to
work
under
price
last
winter
it
was
his
fault
that
they
were
all
working
for
sixpence
halfpenny
and
he
was
going
to
wipe
the
floor
with
him
some
of
his
friends
eagerly
offered
to
assist
but
others
interposed
and
for
a
time
it
looked
as
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
free
fight
the
aggressors
struggling
hard
to
get
at
their
inoffensive
victim
eventually
however
newman
found
a
seat
in
misery
brake
squatting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
horses
thankful
enough
to
be
out
of
reach
of
the
drunken
savages
who
were
now
roaring
out
ribald
songs
and
startling
the
countryside
as
they
drove
along
with
unearthly
blasts
on
the
coach
horn
meantime
although
none
of
them
seemed
to
notice
it
the
brake
was
travelling
at
a
furious
rate
and
swaying
about
from
side
to
side
in
a
very
erratic
manner
it
would
have
been
the
last
carriage
but
things
had
got
a
bit
mixed
at
the
blue
lion
and
instead
of
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
it
was
now
second
just
behind
the
small
vehicle
containing
rushton
and
his
friends
crass
several
times
reminded
them
that
the
other
carriage
was
so
near
that
rushton
must
be
able
to
hear
every
word
that
was
said
and
these
repeated
admonitions
at
length
enraged
the
who
shouted
out
that
they
did
care
a
b
r
if
he
could
hear
who
the
bloody
hell
was
he
to
hell
with
him
rushton
and
you
too
cried
bill
bates
addressing
crass
only
a
dirty
that
all
you
are
a
bloody
rotter
that
the
only
reason
you
gets
put
in
charge
of
jobs
you
a
good
you
a
bloody
sight
worse
than
rushton
or
misery
either
who
was
it
started
the
dodge
eh
why
you
yer
bleeder
orf
bleedin
perch
suggested
bundy
everybody
seemed
to
think
this
was
a
very
good
idea
but
when
the
attempted
to
rise
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
it
out
he
was
thrown
down
by
a
sudden
lurch
of
the
carriage
on
the
top
of
the
prostrate
figure
of
the
bugle
man
and
by
the
time
the
others
had
assisted
him
back
to
his
seat
they
had
forgotten
all
about
their
plan
of
getting
rid
of
crass
meantime
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
had
increased
to
a
fearful
rate
rushton
and
the
other
occupants
of
the
little
wagonette
in
front
had
been
for
some
time
shouting
to
them
to
moderate
the
pace
of
their
horses
but
as
the
driver
of
crass
brake
was
too
drunk
to
understand
what
they
said
he
took
no
notice
and
they
had
no
alternative
but
to
increase
their
own
speed
to
avoid
being
run
down
the
drunken
driver
now
began
to
imagine
that
they
were
trying
to
race
him
and
became
fired
with
the
determination
to
pass
them
it
was
a
very
narrow
road
but
there
was
just
about
room
to
do
it
and
he
had
sufficient
confidence
in
his
own
skill
with
the
ribbons
to
believe
that
he
could
get
past
in
safety
the
terrified
gesticulations
and
the
shouts
of
rushton
party
only
served
to
infuriate
him
because
he
imagined
that
they
were
jeering
at
him
for
not
being
able
to
overtake
them
he
stood
up
on
the
footboard
and
lashed
the
horses
till
they
almost
flew
over
the
ground
while
the
carriage
swayed
and
skidded
in
a
fearful
manner
in
front
the
horses
of
rushton
conveyance
were
also
galloping
at
top
speed
the
vehicle
bounding
and
reeling
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
whilst
its
terrified
occupants
whose
faces
were
blanched
with
apprehension
sat
clinging
to
their
seats
and
to
each
other
their
eyes
projecting
from
the
sockets
as
they
gazed
back
with
terror
at
their
pursuers
some
of
whom
were
encouraging
the
drunken
driver
with
promises
of
quarts
of
beer
and
urging
on
the
horses
with
curses
and
yells
crass
fat
face
was
pallid
with
fear
as
he
clung
trembling
to
his
seat
another
man
very
drunk
and
oblivious
of
everything
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
brake
spewing
into
the
road
while
the
remainder
taking
no
interest
in
the
race
amused
themselves
by
singing
conducted
by
the
as
loud
as
they
could
roar
anyone

the
other
two
brakes
had
fallen
far
behind
the
one
presided
over
by
hunter
contained
a
mournful
crew
nimrod
himself
from
the
effects
of
numerous
drinks
of
ginger
beer
with
secret
dashes
of
gin
in
it
had
become
at
length
crying
drunk
and
sat
weeping
in
gloomy
silence
beside
the
driver
a
picture
of
lachrymose
misery
and
but
dimly
conscious
of
his
surroundings
and
slyme
who
rode
with
hunter
because
he
was
a
fellow
member
of
the
shining
light
chapel
then
there
was
another
paperhanger
an
unhappy
wretch
who
was
afflicted
with
religious
mania
he
had
brought
a
lot
of
tracts
with
him
which
he
had
distributed
to
the
other
men
to
the
villagers
of
tubberton
and
to
anybody
else
who
would
take
them
most
of
the
other
men
who
rode
in
nimrod
brake
were
of
the
working
man
type
ignorant
dolts
without
as
much
intellectuality
as
an
average
cat
attendants
at
various
psas
and
mission
halls
who
went
every
sunday
afternoon
to
be
lectured
on
their
duty
to
their
betters
and
to
have
their
minds
save
the
mark
addled
and
stultified
by
such
persons
as
rushton
sweater
didlum
and
grinder
not
to
mention
such
mental
specialists
as
the
holy
reverend
belchers
and
boshers
and
such
persons
as
john
starr
at
these
meetings
none
of
the
working
men
were
allowed
to
ask
any
questions
or
to
object
to
or
find
fault
with
anything
that
was
said
or
to
argue
or
discuss
or
criticize
they
had
to
sit
there
like
a
lot
of
children
while
they
were
lectured
and
preached
at
and
patronized
even
as
sheep
before
their
shearers
are
dumb
so
they
were
not
permitted
to
open
their
mouths
for
that
matter
they
did
not
wish
to
be
allowed
to
ask
any
questions
or
to
discuss
anything
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
they
sat
there
and
listened
to
what
was
said
but
they
had
but
a
very
hazy
conception
of
what
it
was
all
about
most
of
them
belonged
to
these
psas
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
every
now
and
then
they
were
awarded
prizes
by
smiles
and
other
books
suitable
for
perusal
by
persons
suffering
from
almost
complete
obliteration
of
the
mental
faculties
besides
other
benefits
there
was
usually
a
christmas
club
attached
to
the
or
and
the
things
were
sold
to
the
members
slightly
below
cost
as
a
reward
for
their
servility
they
were
for
the
most
part
tame
poor
wretches
who
contentedly
resigned
themselves
to
a
life
of
miserable
toil
and
poverty
and
with
callous
indifference
abandoned
their
offspring
to
the
same
fate
compared
with
such
as
these
the
savages
of
new
guinea
or
the
red
indians
are
immensely
higher
in
the
scale
of
manhood
they
are
free
they
call
no
man
master
and
if
they
do
not
enjoy
the
benefits
of
science
and
civilization
neither
do
they
toil
to
create
those
things
for
the
benefit
of
others
and
as
for
their
children
most
of
those
savages
would
rather
knock
them
on
the
head
with
a
tomahawk
than
allow
them
to
grow
up
to
be
drudges
for
other
men
but
these
were
not
free
their
servile
lives
were
spent
in
grovelling
and
cringing
and
toiling
and
running
about
like
little
dogs
at
the
behest
of
their
numerous
masters
and
as
for
the
benefits
of
science
and
civilization
their
only
share
was
to
work
and
help
to
make
them
and
then
to
watch
other
men
enjoy
them
and
all
the
time
they
were
tame
and
quiet
and
content
and
said
likes
of
us
ca
expect
to
nothing
better
and
as
for
our
children
wot
been
good
enough
for
us
is
good
enough
for
the
likes
of
them
but
although
they
were
so
religious
and
respectable
and
so
contented
to
be
robbed
on
a
large
scale
yet
in
small
matters
in
the
commonplace
and
petty
affairs
of
their
everyday
existence
most
of
these
men
were
acutely
alive
to
what
their
enfeebled
minds
conceived
to
be
their
own
selfish
interests
and
they
possessed
a
large
share
of
that
singular
cunning
which
characterizes
this
form
of
dementia
that
was
why
they
had
chosen
to
ride
in
nimrod
brake
because
they
wished
to
chum
up
with
him
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
increase
their
chances
of
being
kept
on
in
preference
to
others
who
were
not
so
respectable
some
of
these
poor
creatures
had
very
large
heads
but
a
close
examination
would
have
shown
that
the
size
was
due
to
the
extraordinary
thickness
of
the
bones
the
cavity
of
the
skull
was
not
so
large
as
the
outward
appearance
of
the
head
would
have
led
a
casual
observer
to
suppose
and
even
in
those
instances
where
the
brain
was
of
a
fair
size
it
was
of
inferior
quality
being
coarse
in
texture
and
to
a
great
extent
composed
of
fat
although
most
of
them
were
regular
attendants
at
some
place
of
worship
they
were
not
all
teetotallers
and
some
of
them
were
now
in
different
stages
of
intoxication
not
because
they
had
had
a
great
deal
to
drink
but
because
being
usually
abstemious
it
did
not
take
very
much
to
make
them
drunk
from
time
to
time
this
miserable
crew
tried
to
enliven
the
journey
by
singing
but
as
most
of
them
only
knew
odd
choruses
it
did
not
come
to
much
as
for
the
few
who
did
happen
to
know
all
the
words
of
a
song
they
either
had
no
voices
or
were
not
inclined
to
sing
the
most
successful
contribution
was
that
of
the
religious
maniac
who
sang
several
hymns
the
choruses
being
joined
in
by
everybody
both
drunk
and
sober
the
strains
of
these
hymns
wafted
back
through
the
balmy
air
to
the
last
coach
were
the
cause
of
much
hilarity
to
its
occupants
who
also
sang
the
choruses
as
they
had
all
been
brought
up
under
influences
and
educated
in
schools
they
all
knew
the
words
for
the
night
is
coming
poor
sinner
and
escape
eternal
fire
for
the
shore
and
is
my
wandering
boy
the
last
reminded
harlow
of
a
song
he
knew
nearly
all
the
words
of
the
news
to
mother
the
singing
of
which
was
much
appreciated
by
all
present
and
when
it
was
finished
they
sang
it
all
over
again
philpot
being
so
affected
that
he
actually
shed
tears
and
easton
confided
to
owen
that
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
a
boy
best
friend
is
his
mother
in
this
last
carriage
as
in
the
other
two
there
were
several
men
who
were
more
or
less
intoxicated
and
for
the
same
reason
because
not
being
used
to
taking
much
liquor
the
few
extra
glasses
they
had
drunk
had
got
into
their
heads
they
were
as
sober
a
lot
of
fellows
as
need
be
at
ordinary
times
and
they
had
flocked
together
in
this
brake
because
they
were
all
of
about
the
same
character
not
tame
contented
imbeciles
like
most
of
those
in
misery
carnage
but
men
something
like
harlow
who
although
dissatisfied
with
their
condition
doggedly
continued
the
hopeless
weary
struggle
against
their
fate
they
were
not
teetotallers
and
they
never
went
to
either
church
or
chapel
but
they
spent
little
in
drink
or
on
any
form
of
enjoyment
an
occasional
glass
of
beer
or
a
still
rarer
visit
to
a
and
now
and
then
an
outing
more
or
less
similar
to
this
being
the
sum
total
of
their
pleasures
these
four
brakes
might
fitly
be
regarded
as
so
many
travelling
lunatic
asylums
the
inmates
of
each
exhibiting
different
degrees
and
forms
of
mental
disorder
the
occupants
of
the
first
rushton
didlum
and
might
be
classed
as
criminal
lunatics
who
injured
others
as
well
as
themselves
in
a
properly
constituted
system
of
society
such
men
as
these
would
be
regarded
as
a
danger
to
the
community
and
would
be
placed
under
such
restraint
as
would
effectually
prevent
them
from
harming
themselves
or
others
these
wretches
had
abandoned
every
thought
and
thing
that
tends
to
the
elevation
of
humanity
they
had
given
up
everything
that
makes
life
good
and
beautiful
in
order
to
carry
on
a
mad
struggle
to
acquire
money
which
they
would
never
be
sufficiently
cultured
to
properly
enjoy
deaf
and
blind
to
every
other
consideration
to
this
end
they
had
degraded
their
intellects
by
concentrating
them
upon
the
minutest
details
of
expense
and
profit
and
for
their
reward
they
raked
in
their
harvest
of
muck
and
lucre
along
with
the
hatred
and
curses
of
those
they
injured
in
the
process
they
knew
that
the
money
they
accumulated
was
foul
with
the
sweat
of
their
brother
men
and
wet
with
the
tears
of
little
children
but
they
were
deaf
and
blind
and
callous
to
the
consequences
of
their
greed
devoid
of
every
ennobling
thought
or
aspiration
they
grovelled
on
the
filthy
ground
tearing
up
the
flowers
to
get
at
the
worms
in
the
coach
presided
over
by
crass
bill
bates
the
and
the
other
two
or
three
habitual
boozers
were
all
men
who
had
been
driven
mad
by
their
environment
at
one
time
most
of
them
had
been
fellows
like
harlow
working
early
and
late
whenever
they
got
the
chance
only
to
see
their
earnings
swallowed
up
in
a
few
minutes
every
saturday
by
the
landlord
and
all
the
other
host
of
harpies
and
profitmongers
who
were
waiting
to
demand
it
as
soon
as
it
was
earned
in
the
years
that
were
gone
most
of
these
men
used
to
take
all
their
money
home
religiously
every
saturday
and
give
it
to
the
girl
for
the
house
and
then
lo
and
behold
in
a
moment
yea
even
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
was
all
gone
melted
away
like
snow
in
the
sun
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
except
an
insufficiency
of
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
but
after
a
time
they
had
become
heartbroken
and
sick
and
tired
of
that
sort
of
thing
they
hankered
after
a
little
pleasure
a
little
excitement
a
little
fun
and
they
found
that
it
was
possible
to
buy
something
like
those
in
quart
pots
at
the
pub
they
knew
they
were
not
the
genuine
articles
but
they
were
better
than
nothing
at
all
and
so
they
gave
up
the
practice
of
giving
all
their
money
to
the
old
girl
to
give
to
the
landlord
and
the
other
harpies
and
bought
beer
with
some
of
it
instead
and
after
a
time
their
minds
became
so
disordered
from
drinking
so
much
of
this
beer
that
they
cared
nothing
whether
the
rent
was
paid
or
not
they
cared
but
little
whether
the
old
girl
and
the
children
had
food
or
clothes
they
said
hell
with
everything
and
everyone
and
they
cared
for
nothing
so
long
as
they
could
get
plenty
of
beer
the
occupants
of
nimrod
coach
have
already
been
described
and
most
of
them
may
correctly
be
classed
as
being
similar
to
cretin
idiots
of
the
third
degree
very
cunning
and
selfish
and
able
to
read
and
write
but
with
very
little
understanding
of
what
they
read
except
on
the
most
common
topics
as
for
those
who
rode
with
harlow
in
the
last
coach
most
of
them
as
has
been
already
intimated
were
men
of
similar
character
to
himself
the
greater
number
of
them
fairly
good
workmen
and
unlike
the
boozers
in
crass
coach
not
yet
quite
heartbroken
but
still
continuing
the
hopeless
struggle
against
poverty
these
differed
from
nimrod
lot
inasmuch
as
they
were
not
content
they
were
always
complaining
of
their
wretched
circumstances
and
found
a
certain
kind
of
pleasure
in
listening
to
the
tirades
of
the
socialists
against
the
existing
social
conditions
and
professing
their
concurrence
with
many
of
the
sentiments
expressed
and
a
desire
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
most
of
them
appeared
to
be
quite
sane
being
able
to
converse
intelligently
on
any
ordinary
subject
without
discovering
any
symptoms
of
mental
disorder
and
it
was
not
until
the
topic
of
parliamentary
elections
was
mentioned
that
evidence
of
their
insanity
was
forthcoming
it
then
almost
invariably
appeared
that
they
were
subject
to
the
most
extraordinary
hallucinations
and
extravagant
delusions
the
commonest
being
that
the
best
thing
that
the
working
people
could
do
to
bring
about
an
improvement
in
their
condition
was
to
continue
to
elect
their
liberal
and
tory
employers
to
make
laws
for
and
to
rule
over
them
at
such
times
if
anyone
ventured
to
point
out
to
them
that
that
was
what
they
had
been
doing
all
their
lives
and
referred
them
to
the
manifold
evidences
that
met
them
wherever
they
turned
their
eyes
of
its
folly
and
futility
they
were
generally
immediately
seized
with
a
paroxysm
of
the
most
furious
mania
and
were
with
difficulty
prevented
from
savagely
assaulting
those
who
differed
from
them
they
were
usually
found
in
a
similar
condition
of
maniacal
excitement
for
some
time
preceding
and
during
a
parliamentary
election
but
afterwards
they
usually
manifested
that
modification
of
insanity
which
is
called
melancholia
in
fact
they
alternated
between
these
two
forms
of
the
disease
during
elections
the
highest
state
of
exalted
mania
and
at
ordinary
times
presumably
as
a
result
of
reading
about
the
proceedings
in
parliament
of
the
persons
whom
they
had
elected
in
a
state
of
melancholic
depression
in
their
case
an
instance
of
hope
deferred
making
the
heart
sick
this
condition
occasionally
proved
to
be
the
stage
of
transition
into
yet
another
modification
of
the
disease
that
known
as
dipsomania
the
phase
exhibited
by
bill
bates
and
the
yet
another
form
of
insanity
was
that
shown
by
the
socialists
like
most
of
their
fellow
passengers
in
the
last
coach
the
majority
of
these
individuals
appeared
to
be
of
perfectly
sound
mind
upon
entering
into
conversation
with
them
one
found
that
they
reasoned
correctly
and
even
brilliantly
they
had
divided
their
favourite
subject
into
three
parts
first
an
exact
definition
of
the
condition
known
as
poverty
secondly
a
knowledge
of
the
causes
of
poverty
and
thirdly
a
rational
plan
for
the
cure
of
poverty
those
who
were
opposed
to
them
always
failed
to
refute
their
arguments
and
feared
and
nearly
always
refused
to
meet
them
in
fair
fight
in
open
debate
preferring
to
use
the
cowardly
and
despicable
weapons
of
slander
and
misrepresentation
the
fact
that
these
socialists
never
encountered
their
opponents
except
to
defeat
them
was
a
powerful
testimony
to
the
accuracy
of
their
reasonings
and
the
correctness
of
their
conclusions
and
yet
they
were
undoubtedly
mad
one
might
converse
with
them
for
an
indefinite
time
on
the
three
divisions
of
their
subject
without
eliciting
any
proofs
of
insanity
but
directly
one
inquired
what
means
they
proposed
to
employ
in
order
to
bring
about
the
adoption
of
their
plan
they
replied
that
they
hoped
to
do
so
by
reasoning
with
the
others
although
they
had
sense
enough
to
understand
the
real
causes
of
poverty
and
the
only
cure
for
poverty
they
were
nevertheless
so
foolish
that
they
entertained
the
delusion
that
it
is
possible
to
reason
with
demented
persons
whereas
every
sane
person
knows
that
to
reason
with
a
maniac
is
not
only
fruitless
but
rather
tends
to
fix
more
deeply
the
erroneous
impressions
of
his
disordered
mind
the
wagonette
containing
rushton
and
his
friends
continued
to
fly
over
the
road
pursued
by
the
one
in
which
rode
crass
bill
bates
and
the
but
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
drunken
driver
they
were
unable
to
overtake
or
pass
the
smaller
vehicle
and
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
that
led
up
to
windley
the
distance
between
the
two
carriages
rapidly
increased
and
the
race
was
reluctantly
abandoned
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
rushton
and
his
friends
did
not
wait
for
the
others
but
drove
off
towards
mugsborough
as
fast
as
they
could
crass
brake
was
the
next
to
arrive
at
the
summit
and
they
halted
there
to
wait
for
the
other
two
conveyances
and
when
they
came
up
all
those
who
lived
nearby
got
out
and
some
of
them
sang
save
the
king
and
then
with
shouts
of
night
and
cries
of
forget
six
monday
morning
they
dispersed
to
their
homes
and
the
carriages
moved
off
once
more
at
intervals
as
they
passed
through
windley
brief
stoppages
were
made
in
order
to
enable
others
to
get
out
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top
of
the
long
incline
that
led
down
into
mugsborough
it
was
nearly
twelve
and
the
brakes
were
almost
empty
the
only
passengers
being
owen
and
four
or
five
others
who
lived
down
town
by
ones
and
twos
these
also
departed
disappearing
into
the
obscurity
of
the
night
until
there
was
none
left
and
the
beano
was
an
event
of
the
past
chapter
the
great
oration
the
outlook
for
the
approaching
winter
was
as
usual
gloomy
in
the
extreme
one
of
the
leading
daily
newspapers
published
an
article
prophesying
a
period
of
severe
industrial
depression
the
warehouses
were
glutted
with
the
things
produced
by
the
working
classes
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
do
any
more
work
at
present
and
so
they
would
now
have
to
go
and
starve
until
such
time
as
their
masters
had
sold
or
consumed
the
things
already
produced
of
course
the
writer
of
the
article
did
not
put
it
exactly
like
that
but
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
this
article
was
quoted
by
nearly
all
the
other
papers
both
liberal
and
conservative
the
tory
papers
ignoring
the
fact
that
all
the
protectionist
countries
were
in
exactly
the
same
condition
published
yards
of
misleading
articles
about
tariff
reform
the
liberal
papers
said
tariff
reform
was
no
remedy
look
at
america
and
germany
worse
than
here
still
the
situation
was
undoubtedly
very
serious
continued
the
liberal
papers
and
something
would
have
to
be
done
they
did
not
say
exactly
what
because
of
course
they
did
not
know
but
something
would
have
to
be
done
tomorrow
they
talked
vaguely
about
and
reclaiming
of
foreshores
and
sea
walls
but
of
course
there
was
the
question
of
cost
that
was
a
difficulty
but
all
the
same
something
would
have
to
be
done
some
experiments
must
be
tried
great
caution
was
necessary
in
dealing
with
such
difficult
problems
we
must
go
slow
and
if
in
the
meantime
a
few
thousand
children
die
of
starvation
or
become
or
consumptive
through
lack
of
proper
nutrition
it
is
of
course
very
regrettable
but
after
all
they
are
only
children
so
it
matter
a
great
deal
most
of
the
writers
of
these
liberal
and
tory
papers
seemed
to
think
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
find
for
the
class
that
was
their
conception
of
a
civilized
nation
in
the
twentieth
century
for
the
majority
of
the
people
to
work
like
brutes
in
order
to
obtain
a
wage
for
themselves
and
to
create
luxuries
for
a
small
minority
of
persons
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
at
all
and
although
this
was
all
they
thought
was
necessary
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
in
order
to
bring
even
that
much
to
pass
winter
was
returning
bringing
in
its
train
the
usual
crop
of
horrors
and
the
liberal
and
tory
monopolists
of
wisdom
did
not
know
what
to
do
rushton
had
so
little
work
in
that
nearly
all
the
hands
expected
that
they
would
be
slaughtered
the
next
saturday
after
the
and
there
was
one
man
jim
smith
he
was
called
who
was
not
allowed
to
live
even
till
then
he
got
the
sack
before
breakfast
on
the
monday
morning
after
the
beano
this
man
was
about
years
old
but
very
short
for
his
age
being
only
a
little
over
five
feet
in
height
the
other
men
used
to
say
that
little
jim
was
not
made
right
for
while
his
body
was
big
enough
for
a
his
legs
were
very
short
and
the
fact
that
he
was
rather
inclined
to
be
fat
added
to
the
oddity
of
his
appearance
on
the
monday
morning
after
the
beano
he
was
painting
an
upper
room
in
a
house
where
several
other
men
were
working
and
it
was
customary
for
the
coddy
to
shout
ho
at
mealtimes
to
let
the
hands
know
when
it
was
time
to
leave
off
work
at
about
ten
minutes
to
eight
jim
had
squared
the
part
of
the
work
he
had
been
doing
the
window
so
he
decided
not
to
start
on
the
door
or
the
skirting
until
after
breakfast
whilst
he
was
waiting
for
the
foreman
to
shout
ho
his
mind
reverted
to
the
beano
and
he
began
to
hum
the
tunes
of
some
of
the
songs
that
had
been
sung
he
hummed
the
tune
of
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
he
could
not
get
the
tune
out
of
his
mind
it
kept
buzzing
in
his
head
he
wondered
what
time
it
was
it
could
not
be
very
far
off
eight
now
to
judge
by
the
amount
of
work
he
had
done
since
six
he
had
rubbed
down
and
stopped
all
the
woodwork
and
painted
the
window
a
jolly
good
two
hours
work
he
was
only
getting
an
hour
and
if
he
had
earned
a
bob
he
earned
nothing
anyhow
whether
he
had
done
enough
for
or
not
he
was
goin
to
do
no
more
before
breakfast
the
tune
of
a
jolly
good
fellow
was
still
buzzing
in
his
head
he
thrust
his
hands
deep
down
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
began
to
polka
round
the
room
humming
softly
wo
do
no
more
before
breakfast
i
wo
do
no
more
before
breakfast
i
wo
do
no
more
before
breakfast
so
so
so
i
wo
do
no
more
before
breakfast
etc
and
you
wo
do
but
very
little
after
breakfast
here
shouted
hunter
suddenly
entering
the
room
bin
watchin
of
you
through
the
crack
of
the
door
for
the
last
hour
and
you
not
done
a
dam
stroke
all
the
time
you
make
out
yer
time
sheet
and
go
to
the
office
at
nine
and
git
yer
money
we
ca
afford
to
pay
you
for
playing
the
fool
leaving
the
man
dumbfounded
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
misery
went
downstairs
and
after
kicking
up
a
devil
of
a
row
with
the
foreman
for
the
lack
of
discipline
on
the
job
he
instructed
him
that
smith
was
not
to
be
permitted
to
resume
work
after
breakfast
then
he
rode
away
he
had
come
in
so
stealthily
that
no
one
had
known
anything
of
his
arrival
until
they
heard
him
bellowing
at
smith
the
latter
did
not
stay
to
take
breakfast
but
went
off
at
once
and
when
he
was
gone
the
other
chaps
said
it
served
him
bloody
well
right
he
was
always
singing
he
ought
to
have
more
sense
you
ca
do
as
you
like
nowadays
you
know
easton
who
was
working
at
another
job
with
crass
as
his
foreman
knew
that
unless
some
more
work
came
in
he
was
likely
to
be
one
of
those
who
would
have
to
go
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
was
only
a
week
or
two
at
the
most
before
everything
would
be
finished
up
but
notwithstanding
the
prospect
of
being
out
of
work
so
soon
he
was
far
happier
than
he
had
been
for
several
months
past
for
he
imagined
he
had
discovered
the
cause
of
ruth
strange
manner
this
knowledge
came
to
him
on
the
night
of
the
beano
when
he
arrived
home
he
found
that
ruth
had
already
gone
to
bed
she
had
not
been
well
and
it
was
mrs
linden
explanation
of
her
illness
that
led
easton
to
think
that
he
had
discovered
the
cause
of
the
unhappiness
of
the
last
few
months
now
that
he
knew
as
he
thought
he
blamed
himself
for
not
having
been
more
considerate
and
patient
with
her
at
the
same
time
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
she
had
not
told
him
about
it
herself
the
only
explanation
he
could
think
of
was
the
one
suggested
by
mrs
linden
that
at
such
times
women
often
behaved
strangely
however
that
might
be
he
was
glad
to
think
he
knew
the
reason
of
it
all
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
be
more
gentle
and
forebearing
with
her
the
place
where
he
was
working
was
practically
finished
it
was
a
large
house
called
refuge
very
similar
to
cave
and
during
the
last
week
or
two
it
had
become
what
they
called
a
that
is
as
the
other
jobs
became
finished
the
men
were
nearly
all
sent
to
this
one
so
that
there
was
quite
a
large
crowd
of
them
there
the
inside
work
was
all
finished
with
the
exception
of
the
kitchen
which
was
used
as
a
mess
room
and
the
scullery
which
was
the
paint
shop
everybody
was
working
on
the
job
poor
old
joe
philpot
whose
rheumatism
had
been
very
bad
lately
was
doing
a
very
rough
job
painting
the
gable
from
a
long
ladder
but
though
there
were
plenty
of
younger
men
more
suitable
for
this
philpot
did
not
care
to
complain
for
fear
crass
or
misery
should
think
he
was
not
up
to
his
work
at
dinner
time
all
the
old
hands
assembled
in
the
kitchen
including
crass
easton
harlow
bundy
and
dick
wantley
who
still
sat
on
a
pail
behind
his
usual
moat
philpot
and
harlow
were
absent
and
everybody
wondered
what
had
become
of
them
several
times
during
the
morning
they
had
been
seen
whispering
together
and
comparing
scraps
of
paper
and
various
theories
were
put
forward
to
account
for
their
disappearance
most
of
the
men
thought
they
must
have
heard
something
good
about
the
probable
winner
of
the
handicap
and
had
gone
to
put
something
on
some
others
thought
that
perhaps
they
had
heard
of
another
about
to
be
started
by
some
other
firm
and
had
gone
to
inquire
about
it
to
me
as
if
they
stand
a
very
good
chance
of
gettin
drowned
if
they
gone
very
far
remarked
easton
referring
to
the
weather
it
had
been
threatening
to
rain
all
the
morning
and
during
the
last
few
minutes
it
had
become
so
dark
that
crass
lit
the
gas
so
that
as
he
expressed
it
they
should
be
able
to
see
the
way
to
their
mouths
outside
the
wind
grew
more
boisterous
every
moment
the
darkness
continued
to
increase
and
presently
there
succeeded
a
torrential
downfall
of
rain
which
beat
fiercely
against
the
windows
and
poured
in
torrents
down
the
glass
the
men
glanced
gloomily
at
each
other
no
more
work
could
be
done
outside
that
day
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
inside
as
they
were
paid
by
the
hour
this
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
lose
half
a
day
pay
it
keeps
on
like
this
we
wo
be
able
to
do
no
more
work
and
we
wo
be
able
to
go
home
either
remarked
easton
we
all
right
ai
we
said
the
man
behind
the
moat
a
nice
fire
and
plenty
of
heasy
chairs
wot
the
more
do
you
want
remarked
another
philosopher
we
only
had
a
table
or
a
ring
board
i
reckon
we
should
be
able
to
enjoy
ourselves
all
right
philpot
and
harlow
were
still
absent
and
the
others
again
fell
to
wondering
where
they
could
be
see
old
joe
up
on
ladder
only
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
remarked
wantley
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
a
mystery
at
this
moment
the
two
truants
returned
looking
very
important
philpot
was
armed
with
a
hammer
and
carried
a
pair
of
steps
while
harlow
bore
a
large
piece
of
wallpaper
which
the
two
of
them
proceeded
to
tack
on
the
wall
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
others
who
read
the
announcement
opposite
written
in
charcoal
every
day
at
meals
since
barrington
unexpected
outburst
at
the
beano
dinner
the
men
had
been
trying
their
best
to
him
on
to
make
another
speech
but
so
far
without
success
if
anything
he
had
been
even
more
silent
and
reserved
than
before
as
if
he
felt
some
regret
that
he
had
spoken
as
he
had
on
that
occasion
crass
and
his
disciples
attributed
barrington
manner
to
fear
that
he
was
going
to
get
the
sack
for
his
trouble
and
they
agreed
amongst
themselves
that
it
would
serve
him
bloody
well
right
if
did
get
the
push
when
they
had
fixed
the
poster
on
the
wall
philpot
stood
the
steps
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
the
back
part
facing
outwards
and
then
everything
being
ready
for
the
lecturer
the
two
sat
down
in
their
accustomed
places
and
began
to
eat
their
dinners
harlow
remarking
that
they
would
have
to
buck
up
or
they
would
be
too
late
for
the
meeting
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
began
to
discuss
the
poster
the
does
plo
mean
demanded
bundy
with
a
puzzled
expression
layer
on
answered
philpot
modestly
you
ever
the
professor
preach
before
inquired
the
man
on
the
pail
addressing
bundy
imperial
bankquet
hall
on
thursday
at
prompt
professor
barrington
will
deliver
a
oration
entitled
the
great
secret
or
how
to
live
without
work
the
rev
joe
philpot
plo
late
absconding
secretary
of
the
light
refreshment
fund
will
take
the
chair
and
anything
else
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
at
the
end
of
the
lecture
a
meeting
will
be
arranged
and
carried
out
according
to
the
marquis
of
queensbury
rules
a
collection
will
be
took
up
in
aid
of
the
cost
of
printing
once
at
the
beano
replied
that
individual
that
was
once
too
often
speaker
i
ever
said
the
man
on
the
pail
with
enthusiasm
would
miss
this
lecture
for
anything
this
is
one
of
best
subjects
i
got
about
two
hours
before
the
doors
was
opened
so
as
to
be
sure
to
get
a
seat
it
a
very
good
subject
said
crass
with
a
sneer
believe
most
of
the
labour
members
in
parliament
is
well
up
in
it
wot
about
the
other
members
demanded
philpot
to
me
as
if
most
of
them
knows
something
about
it
too
difference
is
said
owen
working
classes
voluntarily
pay
to
keep
the
labour
members
but
whether
they
like
it
or
not
they
have
to
keep
the
others
labour
members
is
sent
to
the
of
commons
said
harlow
paid
their
wages
to
do
certain
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
working
classes
just
the
same
as
we
sent
and
paid
our
wages
by
the
bloke
to
paint
this
said
crass
if
we
did
do
the
work
we
paid
to
do
we
should
bloody
soon
get
the
sack
ca
see
how
we
got
to
keep
the
other
members
said
slyme
mostly
rich
men
and
they
live
on
their
own
money
course
said
crass
i
should
like
to
know
where
we
should
be
without
talk
about
us
keepin
them
it
seems
to
me
more
like
it
that
they
keeps
us
the
likes
of
us
lives
on
rich
people
where
should
we
be
if
it
was
for
all
the
money
they
spend
and
the
work
they
done
if
the
owner
of
this
the
money
to
spend
to
it
done
up
most
of
us
would
bin
out
of
work
this
last
six
weeks
and
starvin
the
same
as
lots
of
others
been
yes
that
right
enough
agreed
bundy
is
no
good
without
capital
before
any
work
can
be
done
there
one
thing
necessary
and
that
money
it
would
be
easy
to
find
work
for
all
the
unemployed
if
the
local
authorities
could
only
raise
the
money
that
quite
true
said
owen
that
proves
that
money
is
the
cause
of
poverty
because
poverty
consists
in
being
short
of
the
necessaries
of
life
the
necessaries
of
life
are
all
produced
by
labour
applied
to
the
raw
materials
the
raw
materials
exist
in
abundance
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
able
and
willing
to
work
but
under
present
conditions
no
work
can
be
done
without
money
and
so
we
have
the
spectacle
of
a
great
army
of
people
compelled
to
stand
idle
and
starve
by
the
side
of
the
raw
materials
from
which
their
labour
could
produce
abundance
of
all
the
things
they
need
they
are
rendered
helpless
by
the
power
of
money
those
who
possess
all
the
money
say
that
the
necessaries
of
life
shall
not
be
produced
except
for
their
profit
and
you
ca
alter
it
said
crass
triumphantly
always
been
like
it
and
it
always
will
be
like
it
shouted
the
man
behind
the
moat
always
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
and
there
always
will
be
several
others
expressed
their
enthusiastic
agreement
with
opinion
and
most
of
them
appeared
to
be
highly
delighted
to
think
that
the
existing
state
of
affairs
could
never
be
altered
has
always
been
like
it
and
it
wo
always
be
like
it
said
owen
time
will
come
and
it
not
very
far
distant
when
the
necessaries
of
life
will
be
produced
for
use
and
not
for
profit
the
time
is
coming
when
it
will
no
longer
be
possible
for
a
few
selfish
people
to
condemn
thousands
of
men
and
women
and
little
children
to
live
in
misery
and
die
of
want
well
it
wo
be
in
your
time
or
mine
either
said
crass
gleefully
and
most
of
the
others
laughed
with
imbecile
satisfaction
a
of
a
lot
about
this
socialism
remarked
the
man
behind
the
moat
up
to
now
i
never
met
nobody
wot
could
tell
you
plainly
exactly
wot
it
is
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
too
said
easton
means
what
yours
is
mine
and
what
mine
me
own
observed
bundy
and
during
the
laughter
that
greeted
this
definition
slyme
was
heard
to
say
that
socialism
meant
materialism
atheism
and
free
love
and
if
it
were
ever
to
come
about
it
would
degrade
men
and
women
to
the
level
of
brute
beasts
harlow
said
socialism
was
a
beautiful
ideal
which
he
for
one
would
be
very
glad
to
see
realized
and
he
was
afraid
it
was
altogether
too
good
to
be
practical
because
human
nature
is
too
mean
and
selfish
sawkins
said
that
socialism
was
a
lot
of
bloody
rot
and
crass
expressed
the
opinion
which
he
had
culled
from
the
delectable
columns
of
the
obscurer
that
it
meant
robbing
the
industrious
for
the
benefit
of
the
idle
and
thriftless
philpot
had
by
this
time
finished
his
bread
and
cheese
and
having
taken
a
final
draught
of
tea
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
crossing
over
to
the
corner
of
the
room
ascended
the
pulpit
being
immediately
greeted
with
a
tremendous
outburst
of
hooting
howling
and
booing
which
he
smilingly
acknowledged
by
removing
his
cap
from
his
bald
head
and
bowing
repeatedly
when
the
storm
of
shrieks
yells
groans
and
catcalls
had
in
some
degree
subsided
and
philpot
was
able
to
make
himself
heard
he
addressed
the
meeting
as
follows
first
of
all
i
beg
to
thank
you
very
sincerely
for
the
magnificent
and
cordial
reception
you
have
given
me
on
this
occasion
and
i
shall
try
to
deserve
your
good
opinion
by
opening
the
meeting
as
briefly
as
possible
all
jokes
aside
i
think
we
all
agreed
about
one
thing
and
that
is
that
there
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
in
things
in
general
hear
hear
as
our
other
lecturer
professor
owen
pointed
out
in
one
of
lectures
and
as
most
of
you
read
in
the
newspapers
although
british
trade
was
never
so
good
before
as
it
is
now
there
was
never
so
much
misery
and
poverty
and
so
many
people
out
of
work
and
so
many
small
shopkeepers
goin
up
the
spout
as
there
is
at
this
partickiler
time
now
some
people
tells
us
as
the
way
to
put
everything
right
is
to
free
trade
and
plenty
of
cheap
food
well
we
got
them
all
now
but
the
misery
seems
to
go
on
all
around
us
all
the
same
then
there
other
people
tells
us
as
the
is
the
thing
to
put
everything
right
hear
hear
from
crass
and
several
others
and
then
there
another
lot
that
ses
that
socialism
is
the
only
remedy
well
we
all
know
pretty
well
wot
free
trade
and
protection
means
but
most
of
us
do
know
exactly
what
socialism
means
and
i
say
as
it
the
dooty
of
every
man
to
try
and
find
out
which
is
the
right
thing
to
vote
for
and
when
found
it
out
to
do
wot
can
to
to
bring
it
about
and
that
the
reason
we
gorn
to
the
enormous
expense
of
engaging
professor
barrington
to
come
this
afternoon
and
tell
us
exactly
what
socialism
is
i
you
all
just
as
anxious
to
it
as
i
am
myself
i
will
not
stand
between
you
and
the
lecturer
no
longer
but
will
now
call
upon
to
address
you
philpot
was
loudly
applauded
as
he
descended
from
the
pulpit
and
in
response
to
the
clamorous
demands
of
the
crowd
barrington
who
in
the
meantime
had
yielded
to
owen
entreaties
that
he
would
avail
himself
of
this
opportunity
of
proclaiming
the
glad
tidings
of
the
good
time
that
is
to
be
got
up
on
the
steps
in
his
turn
harlow
desiring
that
everything
should
be
done
decently
and
in
order
had
meantime
arranged
in
front
of
the
pulpit
a
carpenter
sawing
stool
and
an
empty
pail
with
a
small
piece
of
board
laid
across
it
to
serve
as
a
seat
and
a
table
for
the
chairman
over
the
table
he
draped
a
large
red
handkerchief
at
the
right
he
placed
a
plumber
large
hammer
at
the
left
a
battered
and
full
of
tea
philpot
having
taken
his
seat
on
the
pail
at
this
table
and
announced
his
intention
of
bashing
out
with
the
hammer
the
brains
of
any
individual
who
ventured
to
disturb
the
meeting
barrington
commenced
chairman
and
gentlemen
for
the
sake
of
clearness
and
in
order
to
avoid
confusing
one
subject
with
another
i
have
decided
to
divide
the
oration
into
two
parts
first
i
will
try
to
explain
as
well
as
i
am
able
what
socialism
is
i
will
try
to
describe
to
you
the
plan
or
system
upon
which
the
commonwealth
of
the
future
will
be
organized
and
secondly
i
will
try
to
tell
you
how
it
can
be
brought
about
but
before
proceeding
with
the
first
part
of
the
subject
i
would
like
to
refer
very
slightly
to
the
widespread
delusion
that
socialism
is
impossible
because
it
means
a
complete
change
from
an
order
of
things
which
has
always
existed
we
constantly
hear
it
said
that
because
there
have
always
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
there
always
must
be
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
first
of
all
that
it
is
not
true
that
even
in
its
essential
features
the
present
system
has
existed
from
all
time
it
is
not
true
that
there
have
always
been
rich
and
poor
in
the
world
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
riches
and
poverty
today
statements
are
lies
that
have
been
invented
for
the
purpose
of
creating
in
us
a
feeling
of
resignation
to
the
evils
of
our
condition
they
are
lies
which
have
been
fostered
by
those
who
imagine
that
it
is
to
their
interest
that
we
should
be
content
to
see
our
children
condemned
to
the
same
poverty
and
degradation
that
we
have
endured
ourselves
i
do
not
propose
because
there
is
not
time
although
it
is
really
part
of
my
subject
to
go
back
to
the
beginnings
of
history
and
describe
in
detail
the
different
systems
of
social
organization
which
evolved
from
and
superseded
each
other
at
different
periods
but
it
is
necessary
to
remind
you
that
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
past
have
been
even
greater
than
the
change
proposed
by
socialists
today
the
change
from
savagery
and
cannibalism
when
men
used
to
devour
the
captives
they
took
in
war
to
the
beginning
of
chattel
slavery
when
the
tribes
or
clans
into
which
mankind
were
divided
whose
social
organization
was
a
kind
of
communism
all
the
individuals
belonging
to
the
tribe
being
practically
social
equals
members
of
one
great
family
found
it
more
profitable
to
keep
their
captives
as
slaves
than
to
eat
them
the
change
from
the
primitive
communism
of
the
tribes
into
the
more
individualistic
organization
of
the
nations
and
the
development
of
private
ownership
of
the
land
and
slaves
and
means
of
subsistence
the
change
from
chattel
slavery
into
feudalism
and
the
change
from
feudalism
into
the
earlier
form
of
capitalism
and
the
equally
great
change
from
what
might
be
called
the
individualistic
capitalism
which
displaced
feudalism
to
the
system
of
capitalism
and
wage
slavery
of
today
believe
you
must
swollered
a
bloody
dictionary
exclaimed
the
man
behind
the
moat
horder
shouted
philpot
fiercely
striking
the
table
with
the
hammer
and
there
were
loud
shouts
of
and
out
from
several
quarters
when
order
was
restored
the
lecturer
proceeded
it
is
not
true
that
practically
the
same
state
of
affairs
as
we
have
today
has
always
existed
it
is
not
true
that
anything
like
the
poverty
that
prevails
at
present
existed
at
any
previous
period
of
the
world
history
when
the
workers
were
the
property
of
their
masters
it
was
to
their
owners
interest
to
see
that
they
were
properly
clothed
and
fed
they
were
not
allowed
to
be
idle
and
they
were
not
allowed
to
starve
under
feudalism
also
although
there
were
certain
intolerable
circumstances
the
position
of
the
workers
was
economically
infinitely
better
than
it
is
today
the
worker
was
in
subjection
to
his
lord
but
in
return
his
lord
had
certain
responsibilities
and
duties
to
perform
and
there
was
a
large
measure
of
community
of
interest
between
them
do
not
intend
to
dwell
upon
this
pout
at
length
but
in
support
of
what
i
have
said
i
will
quote
as
nearly
as
i
can
from
memory
the
words
of
the
historian
froude
i
do
not
believe
says
mr
froude
that
the
condition
of
the
people
in
mediaeval
europe
was
as
miserable
as
is
pretended
i
do
not
believe
that
the
distribution
of
the
necessaries
of
life
was
as
unequal
as
it
is
at
present
if
the
tenant
lived
hard
the
lord
had
little
luxury
earls
and
countesses
breakfasted
at
five
in
the
morning
on
salt
beef
and
herring
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
draught
of
ale
from
a
blackjack
lords
and
servants
dined
in
the
same
hall
and
shared
the
same
meal
we
arrive
at
the
system
that
displaced
feudalism
we
find
that
the
condition
of
the
workers
was
better
in
every
way
than
it
is
at
present
the
instruments
of
production
the
primitive
machinery
and
the
tools
necessary
for
the
creation
of
wealth
belonged
to
the
skilled
workers
who
used
them
and
the
things
they
produced
were
also
the
property
of
those
who
made
them
those
days
a
master
painter
a
master
shoemaker
a
master
saddler
or
any
other
master
tradesmen
was
really
a
skilled
artisan
working
on
his
own
account
he
usually
had
one
or
two
apprentices
who
were
socially
his
equals
eating
at
the
same
table
and
associating
with
the
other
members
of
his
family
it
was
quite
a
common
occurrence
for
the
apprentice
after
he
had
attained
proficiency
in
his
work
to
marry
his
master
daughter
and
succeed
to
his
master
business
in
those
days
to
be
a
master
tradesman
meant
to
be
master
of
the
trade
not
merely
of
some
underpaid
drudges
in
one
employment
the
apprentices
were
there
to
master
the
trade
qualifying
themselves
to
become
master
workers
themselves
not
mere
sweaters
and
exploiters
of
the
labour
of
others
but
useful
members
of
society
in
those
days
because
there
was
no
machinery
the
community
was
dependent
for
its
existence
on
the
productions
of
hand
labour
consequently
the
majority
of
the
people
were
employed
in
some
kind
of
productive
work
and
the
workers
were
honoured
and
respected
citizens
living
in
comfort
on
the
fruits
of
their
labour
they
were
not
rich
as
we
understand
wealth
now
but
they
did
not
starve
and
they
were
not
regarded
with
contempt
as
are
their
successors
of
today
next
great
change
came
with
the
introduction
of
steam
machinery
that
power
came
to
the
aid
of
mankind
in
their
struggle
for
existence
enabling
them
to
create
easily
and
in
abundance
those
things
of
which
they
had
previously
been
able
to
produce
only
a
bare
sufficiency
a
wonderful
power
equalling
and
surpassing
the
marvels
that
were
imagined
by
the
writers
of
fairy
tales
and
eastern
stories
a
power
so
vast
so
marvellous
that
it
is
difficult
to
find
words
to
convey
anything
like
an
adequate
conception
of
it
all
remember
the
story
in
the
arabian
nights
of
aladdin
who
in
his
poverty
became
possessed
of
the
wonderful
lamp
and
he
was
poor
no
longer
he
merely
had
to
rub
the
lamp
the
genie
appeared
and
at
aladdin
command
he
produced
an
abundance
of
everything
that
the
youth
could
ask
or
dream
of
with
the
discovery
of
steam
machinery
mankind
became
possessed
of
a
similar
power
to
that
imagined
by
the
eastern
writer
at
the
command
of
its
masters
the
wonderful
lamp
of
machinery
produces
an
enormous
overwhelming
stupendous
abundance
and
superfluity
of
every
material
thing
necessary
for
human
existence
and
happiness
with
less
labour
than
was
formerly
required
to
cultivate
acres
we
can
now
cultivate
miles
of
land
in
response
to
human
industry
aided
by
science
and
machinery
the
fruitful
earth
teems
with
such
lavish
abundance
as
was
never
known
or
deemed
possible
before
if
you
go
into
the
different
factories
and
workshops
you
will
see
prodigious
quantities
of
commodities
of
every
kind
pouring
out
of
the
wonderful
machinery
literally
like
water
from
a
tap
would
naturally
and
reasonably
suppose
that
the
discovery
or
invention
of
such
an
aid
to
human
industry
would
result
in
increased
happiness
and
comfort
for
every
one
but
as
you
all
know
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
the
reason
of
that
extraordinary
result
is
the
reason
of
all
the
poverty
and
unhappiness
that
we
see
around
us
and
endure
today
it
is
simply
because
the
machinery
became
the
property
of
a
comparatively
few
individuals
and
private
companies
who
use
it
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
but
to
create
profits
for
themselves
this
machinery
became
more
extensively
used
the
prosperous
class
of
skilled
workers
gradually
disappeared
some
of
the
wealthier
of
them
became
distributers
instead
of
producers
of
wealth
that
is
to
say
they
became
shopkeepers
retailing
the
commodities
that
were
produced
for
the
most
part
by
machinery
but
the
majority
of
them
in
course
of
time
degenerated
into
a
class
of
mere
wage
earners
having
no
property
in
the
machines
they
used
and
no
property
in
the
things
they
made
sold
their
labour
for
so
much
per
hour
and
when
they
could
not
find
any
employer
to
buy
it
from
them
they
were
reduced
to
destitution
the
unemployed
workers
were
starving
and
those
in
employment
not
much
better
off
the
individuals
and
private
companies
who
owned
the
machinery
accumulated
fortunes
but
their
profits
were
diminished
and
their
working
expenses
increased
by
what
led
to
the
latest
great
change
in
the
organization
of
the
production
of
the
necessaries
of
life
the
formation
of
the
limited
companies
and
the
trusts
the
decision
of
the
private
companies
to
combine
and
with
each
other
in
order
to
increase
their
profits
and
decrease
their
working
expenses
the
results
of
these
combines
have
been
an
increase
in
the
quantities
of
the
things
produced
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
wage
earners
employed
and
enormously
increased
profits
for
the
shareholders
it
is
not
only
the
class
that
is
being
hurt
for
while
they
are
being
annihilated
by
the
machinery
and
the
efficient
organization
of
industry
by
the
trusts
that
control
and
are
beginning
to
monopolize
production
the
shopkeeping
classes
are
also
being
slowly
but
surely
crushed
out
of
existence
by
the
huge
companies
that
are
able
by
the
greater
magnitude
of
their
operations
to
buy
and
sell
more
cheaply
than
the
small
traders
consequence
of
all
this
is
that
the
majority
of
the
people
are
in
a
condition
of
more
or
less
abject
poverty
living
from
hand
to
mouth
it
is
an
admitted
fact
that
about
thirteen
millions
of
our
people
are
always
on
the
verge
of
starvation
the
significant
results
of
this
poverty
face
us
on
every
side
the
alarming
and
persistent
increase
of
insanity
the
large
number
of
recruits
for
the
army
who
have
to
be
rejected
because
they
are
physically
unfit
and
the
shameful
condition
of
the
children
of
the
poor
more
than
of
the
children
of
the
working
classes
in
london
have
some
sort
of
mental
or
physical
defect
defects
in
development
defects
of
eyesight
abnormal
nervousness
rickets
and
mental
dullness
the
difference
in
height
and
weight
and
general
condition
of
the
children
in
poor
schools
and
the
children
of
the
better
classes
constitutes
a
crime
that
calls
aloud
to
heaven
for
vengeance
upon
those
who
are
responsible
for
it
is
childish
to
imagine
that
any
measure
of
tariff
reform
or
political
reform
such
as
a
paltry
tax
on
goods
or
abolishing
the
house
of
lords
or
disestablishing
the
church
or
miserable
old
age
pensions
or
a
contemptible
tax
on
land
can
deal
with
such
a
state
of
affairs
as
this
they
have
no
house
of
lords
in
america
or
france
and
yet
their
condition
is
not
materially
different
from
ours
you
may
be
deceived
into
thinking
that
such
measures
as
those
are
great
things
you
may
fight
for
them
and
vote
for
them
but
after
you
have
got
them
you
will
find
that
they
will
make
no
appreciable
improvement
in
your
condition
you
will
still
have
to
slave
and
drudge
to
gain
a
bare
sufficiency
of
the
necessaries
of
life
you
will
still
have
to
eat
the
same
kind
of
food
and
wear
the
same
kind
of
clothes
and
boots
as
now
your
masters
will
still
have
you
in
their
power
to
insult
and
sweat
and
drive
your
general
condition
will
be
just
the
same
as
at
present
because
such
measures
as
those
are
not
remedies
but
red
herrings
intended
by
those
who
trail
them
to
draw
us
away
from
the
only
remedy
which
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
public
ownership
of
the
machinery
and
the
national
organization
of
industry
for
the
production
and
distribution
of
the
necessaries
of
life
not
for
the
profit
of
a
few
but
for
the
benefit
of
all
is
the
next
great
change
not
merely
desirable
but
imperatively
necessary
and
inevitable
that
is
socialism
is
not
a
wild
dream
of
superhuman
unselfishness
no
one
will
be
asked
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
benefit
of
others
or
to
love
his
neighbours
better
than
himself
as
is
the
case
under
the
present
system
which
demands
that
the
majority
shall
unselfishly
be
content
to
labour
and
live
in
wretchedness
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
there
is
no
such
principle
of
philanthropy
in
socialism
which
simply
means
that
even
as
all
industries
are
now
owned
by
shareholders
and
organized
and
directed
by
committees
and
officers
elected
by
the
shareholders
so
shall
they
in
future
belong
to
the
state
that
is
the
whole
people
and
they
shall
be
organized
and
directed
by
committees
and
officers
elected
by
the
community
existing
circumstances
the
community
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
invaded
and
robbed
and
massacred
by
some
foreign
power
therefore
the
community
has
organized
and
owns
and
controls
an
army
and
navy
to
protect
it
from
that
danger
under
existing
circumstances
the
community
is
menaced
by
another
equally
great
danger
the
people
are
mentally
and
physically
degenerating
from
lack
of
proper
food
and
clothing
socialists
say
that
the
community
should
undertake
and
organize
the
business
of
producing
and
distributing
all
these
things
that
the
state
should
be
the
only
employer
of
labour
and
should
own
all
the
factories
mills
mines
farms
railways
fishing
fleets
sheep
farms
poultry
farms
and
cattle
ranches
existing
circumstances
the
community
is
degenerating
mentally
and
physically
because
the
majority
can
not
afford
to
have
decent
houses
to
live
in
socialists
say
that
the
community
should
take
in
hand
the
business
of
providing
proper
houses
for
all
its
members
that
the
state
should
be
the
only
landlord
that
all
the
land
and
all
the
houses
should
belong
to
the
whole
people
must
do
this
if
we
are
to
keep
our
old
place
in
the
van
of
human
progress
a
nation
of
ignorant
unintelligent
degenerates
can
not
hope
to
lead
humanity
in
its
march
onward
to
the
conquest
of
the
future
mightiest
fleet
of
iron

vain
the
guns
unless
proud
england
keep
untamed
the
stout
hearts
of
her
sons
the
evils
that
i
have
referred
to
are
only
symptoms
of
the
one
disease
that
is
sapping
the
moral
mental
and
physical
life
of
the
nation
and
all
attempts
to
cure
these
symptoms
are
foredoomed
to
failure
simply
because
they
are
the
symptoms
and
not
the
disease
all
the
talk
of
temperance
and
the
attempts
to
compel
temperance
are
foredoomed
to
failure
because
drunkenness
is
a
symptom
and
not
the
disease
is
a
rich
productive
country
every
year
millions
of
pounds
worth
of
wealth
are
produced
by
her
people
only
to
be
stolen
from
them
by
means
of
the
money
trick
by
the
capitalist
and
official
class
her
industrious
sons
and
daughters
who
are
nearly
all
total
abstainers
live
in
abject
poverty
and
their
misery
is
not
caused
by
laziness
or
want
of
thrift
or
by
intemperance
they
are
poor
for
the
same
reason
that
we
are
poor
because
we
are
robbed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
that
are
yearly
wasted
in
but
useless
charity
accomplish
no
lasting
good
because
while
charity
soothes
the
symptoms
it
ignores
the
disease
which
is
the
private
ownership
of
the
means
of
producing
the
necessaries
of
life
and
the
restriction
of
production
by
a
few
selfish
individuals
for
their
own
profit
and
for
that
disease
there
is
no
other
remedy
than
the
one
i
have
told
you
of
the
public
ownership
and
cultivation
of
the
land
the
public
ownership
of
the
mines
railways
canals
ships
factories
and
all
the
other
means
of
production
and
the
establishment
of
an
industrial
civil
service
a
national
army
of
industry
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
necessaries
comforts
and
refinements
of
life
in
that
abundance
which
has
been
made
possible
by
science
and
machinery
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
whole
of
the
people
and
where
the
money
to
come
from
for
all
this
shouted
crass
fiercely

cried
the
man
behind
the
moat
no
money
difficulty
about
it
replied
barrington
can
easily
find
all
the
money
we
shall
need
course
said
slyme
who
had
been
reading
the
daily
ananias
all
the
money
in
the
post
office
savings
bank
the
socialists
could
steal
that
for
a
start
and
as
for
the
mines
and
land
and
factories
they
can
all
be
took
from
the
owners
by
force
will
be
no
need
for
force
and
no
need
to
steal
anything
from
anybody
there
another
thing
i
objects
to
said
crass
that
all
this
talk
about
hignorance
wot
about
all
the
money
wots
spent
every
year
for
edication
should
rather
say
what
about
all
the
money
that
wasted
every
year
on
education
what
can
be
more
brutal
and
senseless
than
trying
to
educate
a
poor
little
hungry
child
such
instruction
is
like
the
seed
in
the
parable
of
the
sower
which
fell
on
stony
ground
and
withered
away
because
it
had
no
depth
of
earth
and
even
in
those
cases
where
it
does
take
root
and
grow
it
becomes
like
the
seed
that
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
grew
up
and
choked
it
and
it
bore
no
fruit
majority
of
us
forget
in
a
year
or
two
all
that
we
learnt
at
school
because
the
conditions
of
our
lives
are
such
as
to
destroy
all
inclination
for
culture
or
refinement
we
must
see
that
the
children
are
properly
clothed
and
fed
and
that
they
are
not
made
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
go
to
work
for
several
hours
before
they
go
to
school
we
must
make
it
illegal
for
any
greedy
heartless
to
hire
them
and
make
them
labour
for
several
hours
in
the
evening
after
school
or
all
day
and
till
nearly
midnight
on
saturday
we
must
first
see
that
our
children
are
cared
for
as
well
as
the
children
of
savage
races
before
we
can
expect
a
proper
return
for
the
money
that
we
spend
on
education
do
mind
admitting
that
this
scheme
of
national
ownership
and
industries
is
all
right
if
it
could
only
be
done
said
harlow
at
present
all
the
land
railways
and
factories
belongs
to
private
capitalists
they
ca
be
bought
without
money
and
you
say
you
goin
to
take
away
by
force
so
i
should
like
to
know
how
the
bloody
you
are
goin
to
get
certainly
do
propose
to
buy
them
with
money
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
is
not
sufficient
money
in
existence
to
pay
for
them
all
the
gold
and
silver
money
in
the
world
were
gathered
together
into
one
heap
it
would
scarcely
be
sufficient
to
buy
all
the
private
property
in
england
the
people
who
own
all
these
things
now
never
really
paid
for
them
with
money
they
obtained
possession
of
them
by
means
of
the
money
trick
which
owen
explained
to
us
some
time
ago
obtained
possession
of
them
by
usin
their
brain
said
crass
replied
the
lecturer
tell
us
themselves
that
that
is
how
they
got
them
away
from
us
they
call
their
profits
the
wages
of
intelligence
whilst
we
have
been
working
they
have
been
using
their
intelligence
in
order
to
obtain
possession
of
the
things
we
have
created
the
time
has
now
arrived
for
us
to
use
our
intelligence
in
order
to
get
back
the
things
they
have
robbed
us
of
aid
to
prevent
them
from
robbing
us
any
more
as
for
how
it
is
to
be
done
we
might
copy
the
methods
that
they
have
found
so
successful
then
you
do
mean
to
rob
them
after
all
cried
slyme
triumphantly
it
true
that
they
robbed
the
workers
and
if
to
adopt
the
same
method
then
we
be
robbers
too
a
thief
is
caught
having
in
his
possession
the
property
of
others
it
is
not
robbery
to
take
the
things
away
from
him
and
to
restore
them
to
their
rightful
owners

now
calls
upon
the
professor
to
proceed
with
the
second
part
of
the
horation
and
anyone
wot
interrupts
will
get
a
lick
under
the
with
this
waving
the
hammer
the
body
will
be
chucked
out
of
the
bloody
winder
loud
cheers
greeted
this
announcement
it
was
still
raining
heavily
so
they
thought
they
might
as
well
pass
the
time
listening
to
barrington
as
in
any
other
way
large
part
of
the
land
may
be
got
back
in
the
same
way
as
it
was
taken
from
us
the
ancestors
of
the
present
holders
obtained
possession
of
it
by
simply
passing
acts
of
enclosure
the
nation
should
regain
possession
of
those
lands
by
passing
acts
of
resumption
and
with
regard
to
the
other
land
the
present
holders
should
be
allowed
to
retain
possession
of
it
during
their
lives
and
then
it
should
revert
to
the
state
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
all
britain
should
belong
to
the
british
people
not
to
a
few
selfish
individuals
as
for
the
railways
they
have
already
been
nationalized
in
some
other
countries
and
what
other
countries
can
do
we
can
do
also
in
new
zealand
australia
south
africa
germany
belgium
italy
japan
and
some
other
countries
some
of
the
railways
are
already
the
property
of
the
state
as
for
the
method
by
which
we
can
obtain
possession
of
them
the
difficulty
is
not
to
discover
a
method
but
rather
to
decide
which
of
many
methods
we
shall
adopt
one
method
would
be
to
simply
pass
an
act
declaring
that
as
it
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
they
should
be
owned
by
private
individuals
the
railways
would
henceforth
be
the
property
of
the
nation
all
railways
servants
managers
and
officials
would
continue
in
their
employment
the
only
difference
being
that
they
would
now
be
in
the
employ
of
the
state
as
to
the
shareholders
could
all
be
knocked
on
the
i
suppose
interrupted
crass
go
to
the
workhouse
said
slyme
to
suggested
the
man
behind
the
the
state
would
continue
to
pay
to
the
shareholders
the
same
dividends
they
had
received
on
an
average
for
say
the
previous
three
years
these
payments
would
be
continued
to
the
present
shareholders
for
life
or
the
payments
might
be
limited
to
a
stated
number
of
years
and
the
shares
would
be
made
like
the
railway
tickets
of
today
as
for
the
factories
shops
and
other
means
of
production
and
distribution
the
state
must
adopt
the
same
methods
of
doing
business
as
the
present
owners
i
mean
that
even
as
the
big
trusts
and
companies
are
crushing
by
competition
the
individual
workers
and
small
traders
so
the
state
should
crush
the
trusts
by
competition
it
is
surely
justifiable
for
the
state
to
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
people
that
which
the
capitalists
are
already
doing
for
the
profit
of
a
few
shareholders
the
first
step
in
this
direction
will
be
the
establishment
of
retail
stores
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
all
national
and
municipal
employees
with
the
necessaries
of
life
at
the
lowest
possible
prices
at
first
the
administration
will
purchase
these
things
from
the
private
manufacturers
in
such
large
quantities
that
it
will
be
able
to
obtain
them
at
the
very
cheapest
rate
and
as
there
will
be
no
heavy
rents
to
pay
for
showy
shops
and
no
advertising
expenses
and
as
the
object
of
the
administration
will
be
not
to
make
profit
but
to
supply
its
workmen
and
officials
with
goods
at
the
lowest
price
they
will
be
able
to
sell
them
much
cheaper
than
the
private
stores
national
service
retail
stores
will
be
for
the
benefit
of
only
those
in
the
public
service
and
gold
silver
or
copper
money
will
not
be
accepted
in
payment
for
the
things
sold
at
first
all
public
servants
will
continue
to
be
paid
in
metal
money
but
those
who
desire
it
will
be
paid
all
or
part
of
their
wages
in
paper
money
of
the
same
nominal
value
which
will
be
accepted
in
payment
for
their
purchases
at
the
national
stores
and
at
the
national
hotels
restaurants
and
other
places
which
will
be
established
for
the
convenience
of
those
in
the
state
service
the
money
will
resemble
it
will
be
made
of
a
special
very
strong
paper
and
will
be
of
all
value
from
a
penny
to
a
pound
the
national
service
stores
will
sell
practically
everything
that
could
be
obtained
elsewhere
and
as
twenty
shillings
in
paper
money
will
be
able
to
purchase
much
more
at
the
stores
than
twenty
shillings
of
metal
money
would
purchase
anywhere
else
it
will
not
be
long
before
nearly
all
public
servants
will
prefer
to
be
paid
in
paper
money
as
far
as
paying
the
salaries
and
wages
of
most
of
its
officials
and
workmen
is
concerned
the
administration
will
not
then
have
any
need
of
metal
money
but
it
will
require
metal
money
to
pay
the
private
manufacturers
who
supply
the
goods
sold
in
the
national
stores
but
all
these
things
are
made
by
labour
so
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
pay
metal
money
for
them
the
state
will
now
commence
to
employ
productive
labour
all
the
public
land
suitable
for
the
purpose
will
be
put
into
cultivation
and
state
factories
will
be
established
for
manufacturing
food
boots
clothing
furniture
and
all
other
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
all
those
who
are
out
of
employment
and
willing
to
work
will
be
given
employment
on
these
farms
and
in
these
factories
in
order
that
the
men
employed
shall
not
have
to
work
unpleasantly
hard
and
that
their
hours
of
labour
may
be
as
short
as
possible
at
first
say
eight
hours
per
day
and
also
to
make
sure
that
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
everything
shall
be
produced
these
factories
and
farms
will
be
equipped
with
the
most
and
efficient
machinery
the
people
employed
in
the
farms
and
factories
will
be
paid
with
paper
money
the
commodities
they
produce
will
go
to
replenish
the
stocks
of
the
national
service
stores
where
the
workers
will
be
able
to
purchase
with
their
paper
money
everything
they
need
we
shall
employ
the
greatest
possible
number
of
machines
and
adopt
the
most
scientific
methods
in
our
farms
and
factories
the
quantities
of
goods
we
shall
be
able
to
produce
will
be
so
enormous
that
we
shall
be
able
to
pay
our
workers
very
high
wages
in
paper
money
and
we
shall
be
able
to
sell
our
produce
so
cheaply
that
all
public
servants
will
be
able
to
enjoy
abundance
of
everything
the
workers
who
are
being
exploited
and
sweated
by
the
private
capitalists
realize
how
much
worse
off
they
are
than
the
workers
in
the
employ
of
the
state
they
will
come
and
ask
to
be
allowed
to
work
for
the
state
and
also
for
paper
money
that
will
mean
that
the
state
army
of
productive
workers
will
be
continually
increasing
in
numbers
more
state
factories
will
be
built
more
land
will
be
put
into
cultivation
men
will
be
given
employment
making
bricks
woodwork
paints
glass
wallpapers
and
all
kinds
of
building
materials
and
others
will
be
set
to
work
building
on
state
land
beautiful
houses
which
will
be
let
to
those
employed
in
the
service
of
the
state
the
rent
will
be
paid
with
paper
money
fishing
fleets
will
be
established
and
the
quantities
of
commodities
of
all
kinds
produced
will
be
so
great
that
the
state
employees
and
officials
will
not
be
able
to
use
it
all
with
their
paper
money
they
will
be
able
to
buy
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
all
their
needs
abundantly
but
there
will
still
be
a
great
and
continuously
increasing
surplus
stock
in
the
possession
of
the
state
socialist
administration
will
now
acquire
or
build
fleets
of
steam
trading
vessels
which
will
of
course
be
manned
and
officered
by
state
employees
the
same
as
the
royal
navy
is
now
these
fleets
of
national
trading
vessels
will
carry
the
surplus
stocks
i
have
mentioned
to
foreign
countries
and
will
there
sell
or
exchange
them
for
some
of
the
products
of
those
countries
things
that
we
do
not
produce
ourselves
these
things
will
be
brought
to
england
and
sold
at
the
national
service
stores
at
the
lowest
possible
price
for
paper
money
to
those
in
the
service
of
the
state
this
of
course
will
only
have
the
effect
of
introducing
greater
variety
into
the
stocks
it
will
not
diminish
the
surplus
and
as
there
would
be
no
sense
in
continuing
to
produce
more
of
these
things
than
necessary
it
would
then
be
the
duty
of
the
administration
to
curtail
or
restrict
production
of
the
necessaries
of
life
this
could
be
done
by
reducing
the
hours
of
the
workers
without
reducing
their
wages
so
as
to
enable
them
to
continue
to
purchase
as
much
as
before
way
of
preventing
over
production
of
mere
necessaries
and
comforts
will
be
to
employ
a
large
number
of
workers
producing
the
refinements
and
pleasures
of
life
more
artistic
houses
furniture
pictures
musical
instruments
and
so
forth
the
centre
of
every
district
a
large
institute
or
pleasure
house
could
be
erected
containing
a
magnificently
appointed
and
decorated
theatre
concert
hall
lecture
hall
gymnasium
billiard
rooms
reading
rooms
refreshment
rooms
and
so
on
a
detachment
of
the
industrial
army
would
be
employed
as
actors
artistes
musicians
singers
and
entertainers
in
fact
everyone
that
could
be
spared
from
the
most
important
work
of
all
that
of
producing
the
necessaries
of
life
would
be
employed
in
creating
pleasure
culture
and
education
all
these
people
like
the
other
branches
of
the
public
service
would
be
paid
with
paper
money
and
with
it
all
of
them
would
be
able
to
purchase
abundance
of
all
those
things
which
constitute
civilization
as
a
result
of
all
this
the
private
employers
and
capitalists
would
find
that
no
one
would
come
and
work
for
them
to
be
driven
and
bullied
and
sweated
for
a
miserable
trifle
of
metal
money
that
is
scarcely
enough
to
purchase
sufficient
of
the
necessaries
of
life
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
capitalists
will
protest
against
what
they
will
call
the
unfair
competition
of
state
industry
and
some
of
them
may
threaten
to
leave
the
country
and
take
their
capital
with
them
as
most
of
these
persons
are
too
lazy
to
work
and
as
we
will
not
need
their
money
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
them
go
but
with
regard
to
their
real
capital
their
factories
farms
mines
or
machinery
that
will
be
a
different
matter
to
allow
these
things
to
remain
idle
and
unproductive
would
constitute
an
injury
to
the
community
so
a
law
will
be
passed
declaring
that
all
land
not
cultivated
by
the
owner
or
any
factory
shut
down
for
more
than
a
specified
time
will
be
taken
possession
of
by
the
state
and
worked
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
fair
compensation
will
be
paid
in
paper
money
to
the
former
owners
who
will
be
granted
an
income
or
pension
of
so
much
a
year
either
for
life
or
for
a
stated
period
according
to
circumstances
and
the
ages
of
the
persons
concerned
for
the
private
traders
the
wholesale
and
retail
dealers
in
the
things
produced
by
labour
they
will
be
forced
by
the
state
competition
to
close
down
their
shops
and
warehouses
first
because
they
will
not
be
able
to
replenish
their
stocks
and
secondly
because
even
if
they
were
able
to
do
so
they
would
not
be
able
to
sell
them
this
will
throw
out
of
work
a
great
host
of
people
who
are
at
present
engaged
in
useless
occupations
the
managers
and
assistants
in
the
shops
of
which
we
now
see
half
a
dozen
of
the
same
sort
in
a
single
street
the
thousands
of
men
and
women
who
are
slaving
away
their
lives
producing
advertisements
for
in
most
cases
a
miserable
pittance
of
metal
money
with
which
many
of
them
are
unable
to
procure
sufficient
of
the
necessaries
of
life
to
secure
them
from
starvation
masons
carpenters
painters
glaziers
and
all
the
others
engaged
in
maintaining
these
unnecessary
stores
and
shops
will
all
be
thrown
out
of
employment
but
all
of
them
who
are
willing
to
work
will
be
welcomed
by
the
state
and
will
be
at
once
employed
helping
either
to
produce
or
distribute
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
they
will
have
to
work
fewer
hours
than
before
they
will
not
have
to
work
so
hard
for
there
will
be
no
need
to
drive
or
bully
because
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
to
do
the
work
and
most
of
it
will
be
done
by
machinery
and
with
their
paper
money
they
will
be
able
to
buy
abundance
of
the
things
they
help
to
produce
the
shops
and
stores
where
these
people
were
formerly
employed
will
be
acquired
by
the
state
which
will
pay
the
former
owners
fair
compensation
in
the
same
manner
as
to
the
factory
owners
some
of
the
buildings
will
be
utilized
by
the
state
as
national
service
stores
others
transformed
into
factories
and
others
will
be
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
dwellings
or
public
buildings
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
government
to
build
a
sufficient
number
of
houses
to
accommodate
the
families
of
all
those
in
its
employment
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
and
because
of
the
general
disorganization
and
decay
of
what
is
now
called
business
all
other
house
property
of
all
kinds
will
rapidly
depreciate
in
value
the
slums
and
the
wretched
dwellings
now
occupied
by
the
working
classes
the
miserable
uncomfortable
villas
occupied
by
the
lower
middle
classes
and
by
business
people
will
be
left
empty
and
valueless
upon
the
hands
of
their
rack
renting
landlords
who
will
very
soon
voluntarily
offer
to
hand
them
and
the
ground
they
stand
upon
to
the
state
on
the
same
terms
as
those
accorded
to
the
other
property
owners
namely
in
return
for
a
pension
some
of
these
people
will
be
content
to
live
in
idleness
on
the
income
allowed
them
for
life
as
compensation
by
the
state
others
will
devote
themselves
to
art
or
science
and
some
others
will
offer
their
services
to
the
community
as
managers
and
superintendents
and
the
state
will
always
be
glad
to
employ
all
those
who
are
willing
to
help
in
the
great
work
of
production
and
distribution
this
time
the
nation
will
be
the
sole
employer
of
labour
and
as
no
one
will
be
able
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
without
paper
money
and
as
the
only
way
to
obtain
this
will
be
working
it
will
mean
that
every
mentally
and
physically
capable
person
in
the
community
will
be
helping
in
the
great
work
of
production
and
distribution
we
shall
not
need
as
at
present
to
maintain
a
police
force
to
protect
the
property
of
the
idle
rich
from
the
starving
wretches
whom
they
have
robbed
there
will
be
no
unemployed
and
no
overlapping
of
labour
which
will
be
organized
and
concentrated
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
only
rational
object
the
creation
of
the
things
we
require
for
every
one
machine
in
use
today
we
will
if
necessary
employ
a
thousand
machines
and
consequently
there
will
be
produced
such
a
stupendous
enormous
prodigious
overwhelming
abundance
of
everything
that
soon
the
community
will
be
faced
once
more
with
the
serious
problem
of
deal
with
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
reduce
the
hours
of
our
workers
to
four
or
five
hours
a
day
all
young
people
will
be
allowed
to
continue
at
public
schools
and
universities
and
will
not
be
required
to
take
any
part
in
the
work
or
the
nation
until
they
are
years
of
age
at
the
age
of
everyone
will
be
allowed
to
retire
from
the
state
service
on
full
pay
all
these
will
be
able
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
according
to
their
own
inclinations
some
will
settle
down
quietly
at
home
and
amuse
themselves
in
the
same
ways
as
people
of
wealth
and
leisure
do
at
the
present
day
with
some
hobby
or
by
taking
part
in
the
organization
of
social
functions
such
as
balls
parties
entertainments
the
organization
of
public
games
and
athletic
tournaments
races
and
all
kinds
of
sports
will
prefer
to
continue
in
the
service
of
the
state
actors
artists
sculptors
musicians
and
others
will
go
on
working
for
their
own
pleasure
and
honour
some
will
devote
their
leisure
to
science
art
or
literature
others
will
prefer
to
travel
on
the
state
steamships
to
different
parts
of
the
world
to
see
for
themselves
all
those
things
of
which
most
of
us
have
now
but
a
dim
and
vague
conception
the
wonders
of
india
and
egypt
the
glories
of
rome
the
artistic
treasures
of
the
continent
and
the
sublime
scenery
of
other
lands
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
humanity
the
benefits
and
pleasures
conferred
upon
mankind
by
science
and
civilization
will
be
enjoyed
equally
by
all
upon
the
one
condition
that
they
shall
do
their
share
of
the
work
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
all
these
things
possible
are
the
principles
upon
which
the
commonwealth
of
the
future
will
be
organized
the
state
in
which
no
one
will
be
distinguished
or
honoured
above
his
fellows
except
for
virtue
or
talent
where
no
man
will
find
his
profit
in
another
loss
and
we
shall
no
longer
be
masters
and
servants
but
brothers
free
men
and
friends
where
there
will
be
no
weary
broken
men
and
women
passing
their
joyless
lives
in
toil
and
want
and
no
little
children
crying
because
they
are
hungry
or
cold
state
wherein
it
will
be
possible
to
put
into
practice
the
teachings
of
him
whom
so
many
now
pretend
to
follow
a
society
which
shall
have
justice
and
for
its
foundation
and
international
brotherhood
and
love
for
its
law
are
the
days
that
shall
be
but
what
are
the
deeds
of
today
in
the
days
of
the
years
we
dwell
in
that
wear
our
lives
away
why
then
and
for
what
we
are
waiting
there
are
but
three
words
to
speak
we
will
it
and
what
is
the
foreman
but
the
dream
strong
wakened
and
weak
why
and
for
what
are
we
waiting
while
our
brothers
droop
and
die
and
on
every
wind
of
the
heavens
a
wasted
life
goes
by
long
shall
they
reproach
us
where
crowd
on
crowd
they
dwell
poor
ghosts
of
the
wicked
city
gold
crushed
hungry
hell
squalid
life
they
laboured
in
sordid
grief
they
died
those
sons
of
a
mighty
mother
those
props
of
england
pride
they
are
gone
there
is
none
can
undo
it
nor
save
our
souls
from
the
curse
but
many
a
million
cometh
and
shall
they
be
better
or
worse
is
we
must
answer
and
hasten
and
open
wide
the
door
for
the
rich
man
hurrying
terror
and
the
slow
foot
hope
of
the
poor
yea
the
voiceless
wrath
of
the
wretched
and
their
unlearned
discontent
we
must
give
it
voice
and
wisdom
till
the
waiting
tide
be
spent
come
then
since
all
things
call
us
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
weltering
tangle
a
glimmering
light
is
shed
as
barrington
descended
from
the
pulpit
and
walked
back
to
his
accustomed
seat
a
loud
shout
of
applause
burst
from
a
few
men
in
the
crowd
who
stood
up
and
waved
their
caps
and
cheered
again
and
again
when
order
was
restored
philpot
rose
and
addressed
the
meeting
there
any
gentleman
wot
would
like
to
ask
the
speaker
a
question
no
one
spoke
and
the
chairman
again
put
the
question
without
obtaining
any
response
but
at
length
one
of
the
new
hands
who
had
been
on
about
a
week
previously
to
replace
another
painter
who
had
been
sacked
for
being
too
slow
stood
up
and
said
there
was
one
point
that
he
would
like
a
little
more
information
about
this
man
had
two
patches
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
which
were
also
very
much
frayed
and
ragged
at
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
the
lining
of
his
coat
was
all
in
rags
as
were
also
the
bottoms
of
the
sleeves
his
boots
were
old
and
had
been
many
times
mended
and
patched
the
sole
of
one
of
them
had
begun
to
separate
from
the
upper
and
he
had
sewn
these
parts
together
with
a
few
stitches
of
copper
wire
he
had
been
out
of
employment
for
several
weeks
and
it
was
evident
from
the
pinched
expression
of
his
still
haggard
face
that
during
that
time
he
had
not
had
sufficient
to
eat
this
man
was
not
a
drunkard
neither
was
he
one
of
those
persons
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
he
was
married
and
had
several
children
one
of
them
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
old
earned
five
shillings
a
week
as
a
light
porter
at
a
grocer
being
a
householder
the
man
had
a
vote
but
he
had
never
hitherto
taken
much
interest
in
what
he
called
in
his
opinion
those
matters
were
not
for
the
likes
of
him
he
believed
in
leaving
such
difficult
subjects
to
be
dealt
with
by
his
betters
in
his
present
unhappy
condition
he
was
a
walking
testimonial
to
the
wisdom
and
virtue
and
benevolence
of
those
same
who
have
hitherto
managed
the
affairs
of
the
world
with
results
so
very
satisfactory
for
themselves
should
like
to
ask
the
speaker
he
said
all
this
that
talks
about
is
done
what
to
become
of
the
king
and
the
royal
family
and
all
the
big
pots
cried
crass
eagerly
and
ned
dawson
and
the
man
behind
the
moat
both
said
that
that
was
what
they
would
like
to
know
too
am
much
more
concerned
about
what
is
to
become
of
ourselves
if
these
things
are
not
done
replied
barrington
think
we
should
try
to
cultivate
a
little
more
respect
of
our
own
families
and
to
concern
ourselves
a
little
less
about
royal
families
i
fail
to
see
any
reason
why
we
should
worry
ourselves
about
those
people
they
all
right
they
have
all
they
need
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware
nobody
wishes
to
harm
them
and
they
are
well
able
to
look
after
themselves
they
will
fare
the
same
as
the
other
rich
people
should
like
to
ask
said
harlow
to
become
of
all
the
gold
and
silver
and
copper
money
would
it
be
of
no
use
at
all
would
be
of
far
more
use
under
socialism
than
it
is
at
present
the
state
would
of
course
become
possessed
of
a
large
quantity
of
it
in
the
early
stages
of
the
development
of
the
socialist
system
because
at
first
while
the
state
would
be
paying
all
its
officers
and
productive
workers
in
paper
the
rest
of
the
community
those
not
in
state
employ
would
be
paying
their
taxes
in
gold
as
at
present
all
travellers
on
the
state
railways
other
than
state
employees
would
pay
their
fares
in
metal
money
and
gold
and
silver
would
pour
into
the
state
treasury
from
many
other
sources
the
state
would
receive
gold
and
silver
and
for
the
most
part
pay
out
paper
by
the
time
the
system
of
state
employment
was
fully
established
gold
and
silver
would
only
be
of
value
as
metal
and
the
state
would
purchase
it
from
whoever
possessed
and
wished
to
sell
it
at
so
much
per
pound
as
raw
material
instead
of
hiding
it
away
in
the
vaults
of
banks
or
locking
it
up
in
iron
safes
we
shall
make
use
of
it
some
of
the
gold
will
be
manufactured
into
articles
of
jewellery
to
be
sold
for
paper
money
and
worn
by
the
sweethearts
and
wives
and
daughters
of
the
workers
some
of
it
will
be
beaten
out
into
gold
leaf
to
be
used
in
the
decoration
of
the
houses
of
the
citizens
and
of
public
buildings
as
for
the
silver
it
will
be
made
into
various
articles
of
utility
for
domestic
use
the
workers
will
not
then
as
now
have
to
eat
their
food
with
poisonous
lead
or
brass
spoons
and
forks
we
shall
have
these
things
of
silver
and
if
there
is
not
enough
silver
we
shall
probably
have
a
alloy
of
that
metal
far
as
i
can
make
out
said
harlow
paper
money
will
be
just
as
valuable
as
gold
and
silver
is
now
well
wot
to
prevent
artful
dodgers
like
old
misery
and
rushton
saving
it
up
and
buying
and
selling
things
with
it
and
so
livin
without
work
course
said
crass
scornfully
would
never
do
a
very
simple
matter
any
man
who
lives
without
doing
any
useful
work
is
living
on
the
labour
of
others
he
is
robbing
others
of
part
of
the
result
of
their
labour
the
object
of
socialism
is
to
stop
this
robbery
to
make
it
impossible
so
no
one
will
be
able
to
hoard
up
or
accumulate
the
paper
money
because
it
will
be
dated
and
will
become
worthless
if
it
is
not
spent
within
a
certain
time
after
its
issue
as
for
buying
and
selling
for
profit
from
whom
would
they
buy
and
to
whom
would
they
sell
they
might
buy
some
of
the
things
the
workers
did
want
for
less
than
the
workers
paid
for
them
and
then
they
could
sell
again
have
to
sell
them
for
less
than
the
price
charged
at
the
national
stores
and
if
you
think
about
it
a
little
you
see
that
it
would
not
be
very
profitable
it
would
be
with
the
object
of
preventing
any
attempts
at
private
trading
that
the
administration
would
refuse
to
pay
compensation
to
private
owners
in
a
lump
sum
all
such
compensations
would
be
paid
as
i
said
in
the
form
of
a
pension
of
so
much
per
year
very
effective
way
to
prevent
private
trading
would
be
to
make
it
a
criminal
offence
against
the
of
the
community
at
present
many
forms
of
business
are
illegal
unless
you
take
out
a
licence
under
socialism
no
one
would
be
allowed
to
trade
without
a
licence
and
no
licences
would
be
issued
a
man
be
allowed
to
save
up
his
money
if
he
wanted
to
demanded
slyme
with
indignation
will
be
nothing
to
prevent
a
man
going
without
some
of
the
things
he
might
have
if
he
is
foolish
enough
to
do
so
but
he
would
never
be
able
to
save
up
enough
to
avoid
doing
his
share
of
useful
service
besides
what
need
would
there
be
for
anyone
to
save
old
age
would
be
provided
for
no
one
could
ever
be
out
of
employment
if
one
was
ill
the
state
hospitals
and
medical
service
would
be
free
as
for
one
children
they
would
attend
the
state
free
schools
and
colleges
and
when
of
age
they
would
enter
the
state
service
their
futures
provided
for
can
you
tell
us
why
anyone
would
need
or
wish
to
save
slyme
could
there
any
more
questions
demanded
philpot
we
are
speaking
of
money
added
barrington
should
like
to
remind
you
that
even
under
the
present
system
there
are
many
things
which
cost
money
to
maintain
that
we
enjoy
without
having
to
pay
for
directly
the
public
roads
and
pavements
cost
money
to
make
and
maintain
and
light
so
do
the
parks
museums
and
bridges
but
they
are
free
to
all
under
a
socialist
administration
this
principle
will
be
extended
in
addition
to
the
free
services
we
enjoy
now
we
shall
then
maintain
the
trains
and
railways
for
the
use
of
the
public
free
and
as
time
goes
on
this
method
of
doing
business
will
be
adopted
in
many
other
directions
read
somewhere
said
harlow
whenever
a
government
in
any
country
has
started
issuing
paper
money
it
has
always
led
to
bankruptcy
how
do
you
know
that
the
same
thing
would
not
happen
under
a
socialist
administration
said
crass
was
just
goin
to
say
the
same
thing
the
government
of
a
country
began
to
issue
large
amounts
of
paper
money
under
the
present
system
barrington
replied
would
inevitably
lead
to
bankruptcy
for
the
simple
reason
that
paper
money
under
the
present
system
bank
drafts
postal
orders
cheques
or
any
other
form
is
merely
a
printed
promise
to
pay
the
amount
in
gold
or
silver
on
demand
or
at
a
certain
date
under
the
present
system
if
a
government
issues
more
paper
money
than
it
possesses
gold
and
silver
to
redeem
it
is
of
course
bankrupt
but
the
paper
money
that
will
be
issued
under
a
socialist
administration
will
not
be
a
promise
to
pay
in
gold
or
silver
on
demand
or
at
any
time
it
will
be
a
promise
to
supply
commodities
to
the
amount
specified
on
the
note
and
as
there
could
be
no
dearth
of
those
things
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
bankruptcy
should
like
to
know
who
goin
to
appoint
the
hofficers
of
this
hindustrial
harmy
said
the
man
on
the
pail
do
want
to
be
bullied
and
chivied
and
chased
about
by
a
lot
of
sergeants
and
corporals
like
a
lot
of
soldiers
you
know
said
crass
must
some
masters
someone
got
to
be
in
charge
of
the
work
do
have
to
put
up
with
any
bullying
or
chivying
or
chasing
now
do
we
said
barrington
of
course
we
could
not
have
anything
of
that
sort
under
socialism
we
could
not
put
up
with
it
at
all
even
if
it
were
only
for
four
or
five
hours
a
day
under
the
present
system
we
have
no
voice
in
appointing
our
masters
and
overseers
and
foremen
we
have
no
choice
as
to
what
master
we
shall
work
under
if
our
masters
do
not
treat
us
fairly
we
have
no
remedy
against
them
under
socialism
it
will
be
different
the
workers
will
be
part
of
the
community
the
officers
or
managers
and
foremen
will
be
the
servants
of
the
community
and
if
any
one
of
these
men
were
to
abuse
his
position
he
could
be
promptly
removed
as
for
the
details
of
the
organization
of
the
industrial
army
the
difficulty
is
again
not
so
much
to
devise
a
way
but
to
decide
which
of
many
ways
would
be
the
best
and
the
perfect
way
will
probably
be
developed
only
after
experiment
and
experience
the
one
thing
we
have
to
hold
fast
to
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
state
employment
or
national
service
production
for
use
and
not
for
profit
the
national
organization
of
industry
under
democratic
control
one
way
of
arranging
this
business
would
be
for
the
community
to
elect
a
parliament
in
much
the
same
way
as
is
done
at
present
the
only
persons
eligible
for
election
to
be
veterans
of
the
industrial
army
men
and
women
who
had
put
in
their
years
of
service
administrative
body
would
have
control
of
the
different
state
departments
there
would
be
a
department
of
agriculture
a
department
of
railways
and
so
on
each
with
its
minister
and
staff
these
members
of
parliament
would
be
the
relatives
in
some
cases
the
mothers
and
fathers
of
those
in
the
industrial
service
and
they
would
be
relied
upon
to
see
that
the
conditions
of
that
service
were
the
best
possible
for
the
different
branches
of
the
state
service
they
could
be
organized
on
somewhat
the
same
lines
as
the
different
branches
of
the
public
service
are
now
like
the
navy
the
post
office
and
as
the
state
railways
in
some
other
countries
or
as
are
the
different
branches
of
the
military
army
with
the
difference
that
all
promotions
will
be
from
the
ranks
by
examinations
and
by
merit
only
as
every
recruit
will
have
had
the
same
class
of
education
they
will
all
have
absolute
equality
of
opportunity
and
the
men
who
would
attain
to
positions
of
authority
would
be
the
best
men
and
not
as
at
present
the
worst
do
you
make
that
out
demanded
crass
the
present
system
the
men
who
become
masters
and
employers
succeed
because
they
are
cunning
and
selfish
not
because
they
understand
or
are
capable
of
doing
the
work
out
of
which
they
make
their
money
most
of
the
employers
in
the
building
trade
for
instance
would
be
incapable
of
doing
any
skilled
work
very
few
of
them
would
be
worth
their
salt
as
journeymen
the
only
work
they
do
is
to
scheme
to
reap
the
benefit
of
the
labour
of
others
men
who
now
become
managers
and
foremen
are
selected
not
because
of
their
ability
as
craftsmen
but
because
they
are
good
and
useful
producers
of
profit
for
their
employers
are
you
goin
to
prevent
the
selfish
and
cunnin
as
you
call
from
gettin
on
top
then
as
they
do
now
said
harlow
fact
that
all
workers
will
receive
the
same
pay
no
matter
what
class
of
work
they
are
engaged
in
or
what
their
position
will
ensure
our
getting
the
very
best
man
to
do
all
the
higher
work
and
to
organize
our
business
crass
laughed
everybody
to
get
the
same
wages
there
will
be
such
an
enormous
quantity
of
everything
produced
that
their
wages
will
enable
everyone
to
purchase
abundance
of
everything
they
require
even
if
some
were
paid
more
than
others
they
would
not
be
able
to
spend
it
there
would
be
no
need
to
save
it
and
as
there
will
be
no
starving
poor
there
will
be
no
one
to
give
it
away
to
if
it
were
possible
to
save
and
accumulate
money
it
would
bring
into
being
an
idle
class
living
on
their
fellows
it
would
lead
to
the
downfall
of
our
system
and
a
return
to
the
same
anarchy
that
exists
at
present
besides
if
higher
wages
were
paid
to
those
engaged
in
the
higher
work
or
occupying
positions
of
authority
it
would
prevent
our
getting
the
best
men
unfit
persons
would
try
for
the
positions
because
of
the
higher
pay
that
is
what
happens
now
under
the
present
system
men
intrigue
for
and
obtain
or
are
pitchforked
into
positions
for
which
they
have
no
natural
ability
at
all
the
only
reason
they
desire
these
positions
is
because
of
the
salaries
attached
to
them
these
fellows
get
the
money
and
the
work
is
done
by
underpaid
subordinates
whom
the
world
never
hears
of
under
socialism
this
money
incentive
will
be
done
away
with
and
consequently
the
only
men
who
will
try
for
these
positions
will
be
those
who
being
naturally
fitted
for
the
work
would
like
to
do
it
for
instance
a
man
who
is
a
born
organizer
will
not
refuse
to
undertake
such
work
because
he
will
not
be
paid
more
for
it
such
a
man
will
desire
to
do
it
and
will
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
he
will
revel
in
it
to
think
out
all
the
details
of
some
undertaking
to
plan
and
scheme
and
organize
is
not
work
for
a
man
like
that
it
is
a
pleasure
but
for
a
man
who
has
sought
and
secured
such
a
position
not
because
he
liked
the
work
but
because
he
liked
the
salary
such
work
as
this
would
be
unpleasant
labour
under
socialism
the
unfit
man
would
not
apply
for
that
post
but
would
strive
after
some
other
for
which
he
was
fit
and
which
he
would
therefore
desire
and
enjoy
there
are
some
men
who
would
rather
have
charge
of
and
organize
and
be
responsible
for
work
than
do
it
with
their
hands
there
are
others
who
would
rather
do
delicate
or
difficult
or
artistic
work
than
plain
work
a
man
who
is
a
born
artist
would
rather
paint
a
frieze
or
a
picture
or
carve
a
statue
than
he
would
do
plain
work
or
take
charge
of
and
direct
the
labour
of
others
and
there
are
another
sort
of
men
who
would
rather
do
ordinary
plain
work
than
take
charge
or
attempt
higher
branches
for
which
they
have
neither
liking
or
natural
talent
there
is
one
thing
a
most
important
point
that
you
seem
to
entirely
lose
sight
of
and
that
is
that
all
these
different
kinds
and
classes
are
equal
in
one
respect
they
are
all
equally
necessary
each
is
a
necessary
and
indispensable
part
of
the
whole
therefore
everyone
who
has
done
his
full
share
of
necessary
work
is
justly
entitled
to
a
full
share
of
the
results
the
men
who
put
the
slates
on
are
just
as
indispensable
as
the
men
who
lay
the
foundations
the
work
of
the
men
who
build
the
walls
and
make
the
doors
is
just
as
necessary
as
the
work
of
the
men
who
decorate
the
cornice
none
of
them
would
be
of
much
use
without
the
architect
and
the
plans
of
the
architect
would
come
to
nothing
his
building
would
be
a
mere
castle
in
the
air
if
it
were
not
for
the
other
workers
each
part
of
the
work
is
equally
necessary
useful
and
indispensable
if
the
building
is
to
be
perfected
some
of
these
men
work
harder
with
their
brains
than
with
their
hands
and
some
work
harder
with
their
hands
than
with
their
brains
but
each
one
does
his
full
share
of
the
work
this
truth
will
be
recognized
and
acted
upon
by
those
who
build
up
and
maintain
the
fabric
of
our
commonwealth
every
man
who
does
his
full
share
of
the
useful
and
necessary
work
according
to
his
abilities
shall
have
his
full
share
of
the
total
result
herein
will
be
its
great
difference
from
the
present
system
under
which
it
is
possible
for
the
cunning
and
selfish
ones
to
take
advantage
of
the
simplicity
of
others
and
rob
them
of
part
of
the
fruits
of
their
labour
as
for
those
who
will
be
engaged
in
the
higher
branches
they
will
be
sufficiently
rewarded
by
being
privileged
to
do
the
work
they
are
fitted
for
and
enjoy
the
only
men
and
women
who
are
capable
of
good
and
great
work
of
any
kind
are
those
who
being
naturally
fit
for
it
love
the
work
for
its
own
sake
and
not
for
the
money
it
brings
them
under
the
present
system
many
men
who
have
no
need
of
money
produce
great
works
not
for
gain
but
for
pleasure
their
wealth
enables
them
to
follow
their
natural
inclinations
under
the
present
system
many
men
and
women
capable
of
great
works
are
prevented
from
giving
expression
to
their
powers
by
poverty
and
lack
of
opportunity
they
live
in
sorrow
and
die
heartbroken
and
the
community
is
the
loser
these
are
the
men
and
women
who
will
be
our
artists
sculptors
architects
engineers
and
captains
of
industry
the
present
system
there
are
men
at
the
head
of
affairs
whose
only
object
is
the
accumulation
of
money
some
of
them
possess
great
abilities
and
the
system
has
practically
compelled
them
to
employ
those
abilities
for
their
own
selfish
ends
to
the
hurt
of
the
community
some
of
them
have
built
up
great
fortunes
out
of
the
sweat
and
blood
and
tears
of
men
and
women
and
little
children
for
those
who
delight
in
such
work
as
this
there
will
be
no
place
in
our
commonwealth
there
any
more
questions
demanded
philpot
said
harlow
there
wo
be
no
extry
pay
and
if
anybody
will
have
all
they
need
for
just
doing
their
part
of
the
work
what
encouragement
will
there
be
for
anyone
to
worry
his
brains
out
trying
to
invent
some
new
machine
or
make
some
new
discovery
said
barrington
think
that
covered
by
the
last
answer
but
if
it
were
found
necessary
which
is
highly
improbable
to
offer
some
material
reward
in
addition
to
the
respect
esteem
or
honour
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
the
author
of
an
invention
that
was
a
boon
to
the
community
it
could
be
arranged
by
allowing
him
to
retire
before
the
expiration
of
his
years
service
the
boon
he
had
conferred
on
the
community
by
the
invention
would
be
considered
equivalent
to
so
many
years
work
but
a
man
like
that
would
not
desire
to
cease
working
that
sort
go
on
working
all
their
lives
for
love
edison
for
instance
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
inventors
who
have
made
money
out
of
their
work
he
is
a
rich
man
but
the
only
use
his
wealth
seems
to
be
to
him
is
to
procure
himself
facilities
for
going
on
with
his
work
his
life
is
a
round
of
what
some
people
would
call
painful
labour
but
it
is
not
painful
labour
to
him
it
just
pleasure
he
works
for
the
love
of
it
another
way
would
be
to
absolve
a
man
of
that
sort
from
the
necessity
of
ordinary
work
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
to
get
on
with
other
inventions
it
would
be
to
the
interests
of
the
community
to
encourage
him
in
every
way
and
to
place
materials
and
facilities
at
his
disposal
you
must
remember
that
even
under
the
present
system
honour
and
praise
are
held
to
be
greater
than
money
how
many
soldiers
would
prefer
money
to
the
honour
of
wearing
the
intrinsically
valueless
victoria
cross
now
men
think
less
of
money
than
they
do
of
the
respect
esteem
or
honour
they
are
able
to
procure
with
it
many
men
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
striving
to
accumulate
money
and
when
they
have
succeeded
they
proceed
to
spend
it
to
obtain
the
respect
of
their
some
of
them
spend
thousands
of
pounds
for
the
honour
of
being
able
to
write
mp
after
their
names
others
buy
titles
others
pay
huge
sums
to
gain
admission
to
exclusive
circles
of
society
others
give
the
money
away
in
charity
or
found
libraries
or
universities
the
reason
they
do
these
things
is
that
they
desire
to
be
applauded
and
honoured
by
their
desire
is
strongest
in
the
most
capable
men
the
men
of
genius
therefore
under
socialism
the
principal
incentive
to
great
work
will
be
the
same
as
now
honour
and
praise
but
under
the
present
system
honour
and
praise
can
be
bought
with
money
and
it
does
not
matter
much
how
the
money
was
obtained
socialism
it
will
be
different
the
cross
of
honour
and
the
laurel
crown
will
not
be
bought
and
sold
for
filthy
lucre
they
will
be
the
supreme
rewards
of
virtue
and
of
talent
else
like
to
be
flattened
out
inquired
philpot
would
you
do
with
them
what
spends
all
their
money
in
drink
asked
slyme
might
reasonably
ask
you
what
done
with
them
or
what
you
propose
to
do
with
them
now
there
are
many
men
and
women
whose
lives
are
so
full
of
toil
and
sorrow
and
the
misery
caused
by
abject
poverty
who
are
so
shut
out
from
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
that
the
time
they
spend
in
the
public
house
is
the
only
ray
of
sunshine
in
their
cheerless
lives
their
mental
and
material
poverty
is
so
great
that
they
are
deprived
of
and
incapable
of
understanding
the
intellectual
and
social
pleasures
of
civilization
under
socialism
there
will
be
no
such
class
as
this
everyone
will
be
educated
and
social
life
and
rational
pleasure
will
be
within
the
reach
of
all
therefore
we
do
not
believe
that
there
will
be
such
a
class
any
individuals
who
abandoned
themselves
to
such
a
course
would
be
avoided
by
their
fellows
but
if
they
became
very
degraded
we
should
still
remember
that
they
were
our
brother
men
and
women
and
we
should
regard
them
as
suffering
from
a
disease
inherited
from
their
uncivilized
forefathers
and
try
to
cure
them
by
placing
them
under
some
restraint
in
an
institute
for
instance
good
way
to
deal
with
said
harlow
be
to
allow
them
double
pay
so
as
they
could
drink
themselves
to
death
we
could
do
without
the
likes
of
them
the
next
case
said
philpot
abundance
that
you
always
talking
about
said
crass
you
ca
be
sure
that
it
would
be
possible
to
produce
all
that
only
assoomin
that
it
could
be
done
barrington
pointed
to
the
still
visible
outlines
of
the
that
owen
had
drawn
on
the
wall
to
illustrate
a
previous
lecture
under
the
present
silly
system
of
restricted
production
with
the
majority
of
the
population
engaged
in
useless
unproductive
unnecessary
work
and
large
numbers
never
doing
any
work
at
all
there
is
enough
produced
to
go
all
round
after
a
fashion
more
than
enough
for
in
consequence
of
what
they
call
the
markets
are
periodically
glutted
with
commodities
of
all
kinds
and
then
for
a
time
the
factories
are
closed
and
production
ceases
and
yet
we
can
all
manage
to
exist
after
a
fashion
this
proves
that
if
productive
industry
were
organized
on
the
lines
advocated
by
socialists
there
could
be
produced
such
a
prodigious
quantity
of
everything
that
everyone
could
live
in
plenty
and
comfort
the
problem
of
how
to
produce
sufficient
for
all
to
enjoy
abundance
is
already
solved
the
problem
that
then
remains
is
how
to
get
rid
of
those
whose
greed
and
callous
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
others
prevents
it
being
done
and
you
never
be
able
to
get
rid
of
mate
cried
crass
triumphantly
and
the
man
with
the
copper
wire
stitches
in
his
boot
said
that
it
could
be
done
we
mean
to
have
a
good
try
anyhow
said
barrington
crass
and
most
of
the
others
tried
hard
to
think
of
something
to
say
in
defence
of
the
existing
state
of
affairs
or
against
the
proposals
put
forward
by
the
lecturer
but
finding
nothing
they
maintained
a
sullen
and
gloomy
silence
the
man
with
the
copper
wire
stitches
in
his
boot
in
particular
appeared
to
be
very
much
upset
perhaps
he
was
afraid
that
if
the
things
advocated
by
the
speaker
ever
came
to
pass
he
would
not
have
any
boots
at
all
to
assume
that
he
had
some
such
thought
as
this
is
the
only
rational
way
to
account
for
his
hostility
for
in
his
case
no
change
could
have
been
for
the
worse
unless
it
reduced
him
to
almost
absolute
nakedness
and
starvation
to
judge
by
their
unwillingness
to
consider
any
proposals
to
alter
the
present
system
one
might
have
supposed
that
they
were
afraid
of
losing
something
instead
of
having
nothing
to
lose
except
their
poverty
it
was
not
till
the
chairman
had
made
several
urgent
appeals
for
more
questions
that
crass
brightened
up
a
glad
smile
slowly
spread
over
and
illuminated
his
greasy
visage
he
had
at
last
thought
of
a
most
serious
and
insurmountable
obstacle
to
the
establishment
of
the
commonwealth
he
demanded
in
a
loud
voice
are
you
goin
to
do
in
this
socialist
republic
of
yours
with
them
wot
wo
work
as
crass
flung
this
bombshell
into
the
socialist
camp
the
miserable
crew
around
him
could
scarce
forbear
a
cheer
but
the
more
intelligent
part
of
the
audience
only
laughed
do
believe
that
there
will
be
any
such
people
as
that
said
barrington
plenty
of
about
now
anyway
sneered
crass
ca
change
nature
you
know
cried
the
man
behind
the
moat
and
the
one
who
had
the
copper
wire
stitches
in
his
boot
laughed
scornfully
i
know
there
are
plenty
such
now
rejoined
barrington
only
what
is
to
be
expected
considering
that
practically
all
workers
live
in
poverty
and
are
regarded
with
contempt
the
conditions
under
which
most
of
the
work
is
done
at
present
are
so
unpleasant
and
degrading
that
everyone
refuses
to
do
any
unless
they
are
compelled
none
of
us
here
for
instance
would
continue
to
work
for
rushton
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
we
have
either
to
do
so
or
starve
and
when
we
do
work
we
only
just
earn
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
under
the
present
system
everybody
who
can
possibly
manage
to
do
so
avoids
doing
any
work
the
only
difference
being
that
some
people
do
their
loafing
better
than
others
the
aristocracy
are
too
lazy
to
work
but
they
seem
to
get
on
all
right
they
have
their
tenants
to
work
for
them
rushton
is
too
lazy
to
work
so
he
has
arranged
that
we
and
nimrod
shall
work
instead
and
he
fares
much
better
than
any
of
us
who
do
work
then
there
is
another
kind
of
loafers
who
go
about
begging
and
occasionally
starving
rather
than
submit
to
such
abominable
conditions
as
are
offered
to
them
these
last
are
generally
not
much
worse
off
than
we
are
and
they
are
often
better
off
at
present
people
have
everything
to
gain
and
but
little
to
lose
by
refusing
to
work
under
socialism
it
would
be
just
the
reverse
the
conditions
of
labour
would
be
so
pleasant
the
hours
of
obligatory
work
so
few
and
the
reward
so
great
that
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
that
any
one
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
incur
the
contempt
of
his
fellows
and
make
himself
a
social
outcast
by
refusing
to
do
the
small
share
of
work
demanded
of
him
by
the
community
of
which
he
was
a
member
for
what
we
should
do
to
such
individuals
if
there
did
happen
to
be
some
i
can
assure
you
that
we
would
not
treat
them
as
you
treat
them
now
we
would
not
dress
them
up
in
silk
and
satin
and
broadcloth
and
fine
linen
we
would
not
embellish
them
as
you
do
with
jewels
of
gold
and
jewels
of
silver
and
with
precious
stones
neither
should
we
allow
them
to
fare
sumptuously
every
day
our
method
of
dealing
with
them
would
be
quite
different
from
yours
in
the
commonwealth
there
will
be
no
place
for
loafers
whether
they
call
themselves
aristocrats
or
tramps
those
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
shall
have
no
share
in
the
things
that
are
produced
by
the
labour
of
others
those
who
do
nothing
shall
have
nothing
if
any
man
will
not
work
neither
shall
he
eat
under
the
present
system
a
man
who
is
really
too
lazy
to
work
may
stop
you
in
the
street
and
tell
you
that
he
can
not
get
employment
for
all
you
know
he
may
be
telling
the
truth
and
if
you
have
any
feeling
and
are
able
you
will
help
him
but
in
the
socialist
state
no
one
would
have
such
an
excuse
because
everyone
that
was
willing
would
be
welcome
to
come
and
help
in
the
work
of
producing
wealth
and
happiness
for
all
and
afterwards
he
would
also
be
welcome
to
his
full
share
of
the
results
more
complaints
inquired
the
chairman
breaking
the
gloomy
silence
that
followed
do
want
anyone
to
think
that
i
am
blaming
any
of
these
loafers
barrington
added
wealthy
ones
can
not
be
expected
voluntarily
to
come
and
work
under
existing
conditions
and
if
they
were
to
do
so
they
would
be
doing
more
harm
than
good
they
would
be
doing
some
poor
wretches
out
of
employment
they
are
not
to
be
blamed
the
people
who
are
to
blame
are
the
working
classes
themselves
who
demand
and
vote
for
the
continuance
of
the
present
system
as
for
the
other
class
of
loafers
those
at
the
bottom
the
tramps
and
people
of
that
sort
if
they
were
to
become
sober
and
industrious
tomorrow
they
also
would
be
doing
more
harm
than
good
to
the
other
workers
it
would
increase
the
competition
for
work
if
all
the
loafers
in
mugsborough
could
suddenly
be
transformed
into
decent
house
painters
next
week
nimrod
might
be
able
to
cut
down
the
wages
another
penny
an
hour
i
do
wish
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
these
tramps
at
all
some
of
them
are
such
simply
because
they
would
rather
starve
than
submit
to
the
degrading
conditions
that
we
submit
to
they
do
not
see
the
force
of
being
bullied
and
chased
and
driven
about
in
order
to
gain
and
rags
they
are
able
to
get
those
without
working
and
i
sometimes
think
that
they
are
more
worthy
of
respect
and
are
altogether
a
nobler
type
of
beings
than
a
lot
of
wretches
like
ourselves
who
are
always
at
the
mercy
of
our
masters
and
always
in
dread
of
the
sack
more
questions
said
the
chairman
you
mean
to
say
as
the
time
will
ever
come
when
the
gentry
will
mix
up
on
equal
terms
with
the
likes
of
us
demanded
the
man
behind
the
moat
scornfully
no
replied
the
lecturer
when
we
get
socialism
there
wo
be
any
people
like
us
everybody
will
be
civilized
the
man
behind
the
moat
did
not
seem
very
satisfied
with
this
answer
and
told
the
others
that
he
could
not
see
anything
to
laugh
at
there
any
more
questions
cried
philpot
is
your
chance
to
get
some
of
your
own
back
but
do
hall
speak
at
once
should
like
to
know
who
goin
to
do
all
the
dirty
work
said
slyme
everyone
is
to
be
allowed
to
choose
own
trade
who
be
fool
enough
to
choose
to
be
a
scavenger
a
sweep
a
dustman
or
a
sewer
man
nobody
would
want
to
do
such
jobs
as
them
and
everyone
would
be
after
the
soft
jobs
course
cried
crass
eagerly
clutching
at
this
last
straw
thing
sounds
all
right
till
you
comes
to
look
into
it
but
it
never
work
would
be
very
easy
to
deal
with
any
difficulty
of
that
sort
replied
barrington
it
were
found
that
too
many
people
were
desirous
of
pursuing
certain
callings
it
would
be
known
that
the
conditions
attached
to
those
kinds
of
work
were
unfairly
easy
as
compared
with
other
lines
so
the
conditions
in
those
trades
would
be
made
more
severe
a
higher
degree
of
skill
would
be
required
if
we
found
that
too
many
persons
wished
to
be
doctors
architects
engineers
and
so
forth
we
would
increase
the
severity
of
the
examinations
this
would
scare
away
all
but
the
most
gifted
and
enthusiastic
we
should
thus
at
one
stroke
reduce
the
number
of
applicants
and
secure
the
very
best
men
for
the
work
we
should
have
better
doctors
better
architects
better
engineers
than
before
regards
those
disagreeable
tasks
for
which
there
was
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
volunteers
we
should
adopt
the
opposite
means
suppose
that
six
hours
was
the
general
thing
and
we
found
that
we
could
not
get
any
sewer
men
we
should
reduce
the
hours
of
labour
in
that
department
to
four
or
if
necessary
to
two
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
disagreeable
nature
of
the
work
way
out
of
such
difficulties
would
be
to
have
a
separate
division
of
the
industrial
army
to
do
all
such
work
and
to
make
it
obligatory
for
every
man
to
put
in
his
first
year
of
state
service
as
a
member
of
this
corps
there
would
be
no
hardship
in
that
everyone
gets
the
benefit
of
such
work
there
would
be
no
injustice
in
requiring
everyone
to
share
this
would
have
the
effect
also
of
stimulating
invention
it
would
be
to
everyone
interest
to
think
out
means
of
doing
away
with
such
kinds
of
work
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
most
of
it
will
be
done
by
machinery
in
some
way
or
other
a
few
years
ago
the
only
way
to
light
up
the
streets
of
a
town
was
to
go
round
to
each
separate
gas
lamp
and
light
each
jet
one
at
a
time
now
we
press
a
few
buttons
and
light
up
the
town
with
electricity
in
the
future
we
shall
probably
be
able
to
press
a
button
and
flush
the
sewers
about
religion
said
slyme
suppose
there
wo
be
no
churches
nor
chapels
we
shall
all
have
to
be
atheists
will
be
perfectly
free
to
enjoy
their
own
opinions
and
to
practise
any
religion
they
like
but
no
religion
or
sect
will
be
maintained
by
the
state
if
any
congregation
or
body
of
people
wish
to
have
a
building
for
their
own
exclusive
use
as
a
church
or
chapel
or
lecture
hall
it
will
be
supplied
to
them
by
the
state
on
the
same
terms
as
those
upon
which
dwelling
houses
will
be
supplied
the
state
will
construct
the
special
kind
of
building
and
the
congregation
will
have
to
pay
the
rent
the
amount
to
be
based
on
the
cost
of
construction
in
paper
money
of
course
as
far
as
the
embellishment
or
decoration
of
such
places
is
concerned
there
will
of
course
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
members
of
the
congregation
if
they
wish
from
doing
any
such
work
as
that
themselves
in
their
own
spare
time
of
which
they
will
have
plenty
everybody
got
to
do
their
share
of
work
where
the
minister
and
clergymen
to
come
from
are
at
least
three
ways
out
of
that
difficulty
first
ministers
of
religion
could
be
drawn
from
the
ranks
of
the
veterans
men
over
years
old
who
had
completed
their
term
of
state
service
you
must
remember
that
these
will
not
be
worn
out
wrecks
as
too
many
of
the
working
classes
are
at
that
age
now
they
will
have
had
good
food
and
clothing
and
good
general
conditions
all
their
lives
and
consequently
they
will
be
in
the
very
prime
of
life
they
will
be
younger
than
many
of
us
now
are
at
thirty
they
will
be
ideal
men
for
the
positions
we
are
speaking
of
all
well
educated
in
their
youth
and
all
will
have
had
plenty
of
leisure
for
self
culture
during
the
years
of
their
state
service
and
they
will
have
the
additional
recommendation
that
their
congregation
will
not
be
required
to
pay
anything
for
their
services
way
if
a
congregation
wished
to
retain
the
services
of
a
young
man
whom
they
thought
specially
gifted
but
who
had
not
completed
his
term
of
state
service
they
could
secure
him
by
paying
the
state
for
his
services
thus
the
young
man
would
still
remain
in
state
employment
he
would
still
continue
to
receive
his
pay
from
the
national
treasury
and
at
the
age
of
would
be
entitled
to
his
pension
like
any
other
worker
and
after
that
the
congregation
would
not
have
to
pay
the
state
anything
third
and
as
it
seems
to
me
the
most
respectable
way
would
be
for
the
individual
in
question
to
act
as
minister
or
pastor
or
lecturer
or
whatever
it
was
to
the
congregation
without
seeking
to
get
out
of
doing
his
share
of
the
state
service
the
hours
of
obligatory
work
would
be
so
short
and
the
work
so
light
that
he
would
have
abundance
of
leisure
to
prepare
his
orations
without
sponging
on
his
cried
harlow
course
added
barrington
would
not
only
be
congregations
of
christians
who
could
adopt
any
of
these
methods
it
is
possible
that
a
congregation
of
agnostics
for
instance
might
want
a
separate
building
or
to
maintain
a
lecturer
the
an
agnostic
demanded
bundy
agnostic
said
the
man
behind
the
moat
a
bloke
wot
believe
nothing
unless
see
it
with
own
eyes
these
details
continued
the
speaker
the
organization
of
affairs
and
the
work
of
the
commonwealth
are
things
which
do
not
concern
us
at
all
they
have
merely
been
suggested
by
different
individuals
as
showing
some
ways
in
which
these
things
could
be
arranged
the
exact
methods
to
be
adopted
will
be
decided
upon
by
the
opinion
of
the
majority
when
the
work
is
being
done
meantime
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
insist
upon
the
duty
of
the
state
to
provide
productive
work
for
the
unemployed
the
state
feeding
of
schoolchildren
the
nationalization
or
socialization
of
railways
land
the
trusts
and
all
public
services
that
are
still
in
the
hands
of
private
companies
if
you
wish
to
see
these
things
done
you
must
cease
from
voting
for
liberal
and
tory
sweaters
shareholders
of
companies
lawyers
aristocrats
and
capitalists
and
you
must
fill
the
house
of
commons
with
revolutionary
socialists
that
is
with
men
who
are
in
favour
of
completely
changing
the
present
system
and
in
the
day
that
you
do
that
you
will
have
solved
the
poverty
problem
no
more
tramping
the
streets
begging
for
a
job
no
more
hungry
children
at
home
no
more
broken
boots
and
ragged
clothes
no
more
women
and
children
killing
themselves
with
painful
labour
whilst
strong
men
stand
idly
by
but
joyous
work
and
joyous
leisure
for
all
there
any
more
questions
cried
philpot
it
true
said
easton
socialists
intend
to
do
away
with
the
army
and
navy
it
is
true
socialists
believe
in
international
brotherhood
and
peace
nearly
all
wars
are
caused
by
capitalists
seeking
new
fields
for
commercial
exploitation
and
by
aristocrats
who
make
it
the
means
of
glorifying
themselves
in
the
eyes
of
the
deluded
common
people
you
must
remember
that
socialism
is
not
only
a
national
but
an
international
movement
and
when
it
is
realized
there
will
be
no
possibility
of
war
and
we
shall
no
longer
need
to
maintain
an
army
and
navy
or
to
waste
a
lot
of
labour
building
warships
or
manufacturing
arms
and
ammunition
all
those
people
who
are
now
employed
will
then
be
at
liberty
to
assist
in
the
great
work
of
producing
the
benefits
of
civilization
creating
wealth
and
knowledge
and
happiness
for
themselves
and
others
socialism
means
peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
to
all
mankind
but
in
the
meantime
we
know
that
the
people
of
other
nations
are
not
yet
all
socialists
we
do
not
forget
that
in
foreign
countries
just
the
same
as
in
britain
there
are
large
numbers
of
profit
seeking
capitalists
who
are
so
destitute
of
humanity
that
if
they
thought
it
could
be
done
successfully
and
with
profit
to
themselves
they
would
not
scruple
to
come
here
to
murder
and
to
rob
we
do
not
forget
that
in
foreign
countries
the
same
as
here
there
are
plenty
of
christian
bishops
and
priests
always
ready
to
give
their
benediction
to
any
such
murderous
projects
and
to
blasphemously
pray
to
the
supreme
being
to
help
his
children
to
slay
each
other
like
wild
beasts
and
knowing
and
remembering
all
this
we
realize
that
until
we
have
done
away
with
capitalism
aristocracy
and
clericalism
it
is
our
duty
to
be
prepared
to
defend
our
homes
and
our
native
land
and
therefore
we
are
in
favour
of
maintaining
national
defensive
forces
in
the
highest
possible
state
of
efficiency
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
are
in
favour
of
the
present
system
of
organizing
those
forces
we
do
not
believe
in
conscription
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
nation
should
continue
to
maintain
a
professional
standing
army
to
be
used
at
home
for
the
purpose
of
butchering
men
and
women
of
the
working
classes
in
the
interests
of
a
handful
of
capitalists
as
has
been
done
at
featherstone
and
belfast
or
to
be
used
abroad
to
murder
and
rob
the
people
of
other
nations
socialists
advocate
the
establishment
of
a
national
citizen
army
for
defensive
purposes
only
we
believe
that
every
able
bodied
man
should
be
compelled
to
belong
to
this
force
and
to
undergo
a
course
of
military
training
but
without
making
him
into
a
professional
soldier
or
taking
him
away
from
civil
life
depriving
him
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
or
making
him
subject
to
military
law
which
is
only
another
name
for
tyranny
and
despotism
this
citizen
army
could
be
organized
on
somewhat
similar
lines
to
the
present
territorial
force
with
certain
differences
for
instance
we
do
not
believe
as
our
present
rulers
do
that
wealth
and
aristocratic
influence
are
the
two
most
essential
qualifications
for
an
efficient
officer
we
believe
that
all
ranks
should
be
attainable
by
any
man
no
matter
how
poor
who
is
capable
of
passing
the
necessary
examinations
and
that
there
should
be
no
expense
attached
to
those
positions
which
the
government
grant
or
the
pay
is
not
sufficient
to
cover
the
officers
could
be
appointed
in
any
one
of
several
ways
they
might
be
elected
by
the
men
they
would
have
to
command
the
only
qualification
required
being
that
they
had
passed
their
examinations
or
they
might
be
appointed
according
to
merit
the
candidate
obtaining
the
highest
number
of
marks
at
the
examinations
to
have
the
first
call
on
any
vacant
post
and
so
on
in
order
of
merit
we
believe
in
the
total
abolition
of
courts
martial
any
offence
against
discipline
should
be
punishable
by
the
ordinary
civil
law
no
member
of
the
citizen
army
being
deprived
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
about
the
navy
cried
several
voices
wants
to
interfere
with
the
navy
except
to
make
its
organization
more
democratic
the
same
as
that
of
the
citizen
army
and
to
protect
its
members
from
tyranny
by
entitling
them
to
be
tried
in
a
civil
court
for
any
alleged
offence
has
been
proved
that
if
the
soil
of
this
country
were
scientifically
cultivated
it
is
capable
of
producing
sufficient
to
maintain
a
population
of
a
hundred
millions
of
people
our
present
population
is
only
about
forty
millions
but
so
long
as
the
land
remains
in
the
possession
of
persons
who
refuse
to
allow
it
to
be
cultivated
we
shall
continue
to
be
dependent
on
other
countries
for
our
food
supply
so
long
as
we
are
in
that
position
and
so
long
as
foreign
countries
are
governed
by
liberal
and
tory
capitalists
we
shall
need
the
navy
to
protect
our
overseas
commerce
from
them
if
we
had
a
citizen
army
such
as
i
have
mentioned
of
nine
or
ten
millions
of
men
and
if
the
land
of
this
country
was
properly
cultivated
we
should
be
invincible
at
home
no
foreign
power
would
ever
be
mad
enough
to
attempt
to
land
their
forces
on
our
shores
but
they
would
now
be
able
to
starve
us
all
to
death
in
a
month
if
it
were
not
for
the
navy
a
sensible
and
creditable
position
is
it
concluded
barrington
in
times
of
peace
thousands
of
people
standing
idle
and
tamely
starving
in
their
own
fertile
country
because
a
few
land
lords
forbid
them
to
cultivate
it
there
any
more
questions
demanded
philpot
breaking
a
prolonged
silence
any
liberal
or
tory
capitalist
like
to
get
up
into
the
pulpit
and
oppose
the
speaker
the
chairman
went
on
finding
that
no
one
responded
to
his
appeal
for
questions
the
silence
continued
there
no
more
questions
and
no
one
wo
get
up
into
the
pulpit
it
is
now
my
painful
duty
to
call
upon
someone
to
move
a
resolution
mr
chairman
said
harlow
may
say
that
when
i
came
on
this
firm
i
was
a
liberal
but
through
listenin
to
several
lectures
by
professor
owen
and
attendin
the
meetings
on
the
hill
at
windley
and
reading
the
books
and
pamphlets
i
bought
there
and
from
owen
i
came
to
the
conclusion
some
time
ago
that
it
a
mug
game
for
us
to
vote
for
capitalists
whether
they
calls
theirselves
liberals
or
tories
all
alike
when
you
workin
for
i
defy
any
man
to
say
what
the
difference
between
a
liberal
and
a
tory
employer
there
is
none
there
ca
be
they
both
sweaters
and
they
got
to
be
or
they
would
be
able
to
compete
with
each
other
and
since
that
what
they
are
i
say
it
a
mug
game
for
us
to
vote
into
parliament
to
rule
over
us
and
to
make
laws
that
we
got
to
abide
by
whether
we
like
it
or
not
there
nothing
to
choose
between
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
it
never
made
much
difference
to
us
which
party
was
in
or
which
was
out
it
quite
true
that
in
the
past
both
of
have
passed
good
laws
but
they
only
done
it
when
public
opinion
was
so
strong
in
favour
of
it
that
they
knew
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
and
then
it
was
a
toss
up
which
side
did
it
the
way
i
been
lookin
at
things
lately
and
i
almost
made
up
my
mind
never
to
vote
no
more
or
to
trouble
myself
about
politics
at
all
because
although
i
could
see
there
was
no
sense
in
voting
for
liberal
or
tory
capitalists
at
the
same
time
i
must
admit
i
make
out
how
socialism
was
going
to
help
us
but
the
explanation
of
it
which
professor
barrington
has
given
us
this
afternoon
has
been
a
bit
of
an
eye
opener
for
me
and
with
your
permission
i
should
like
to
move
as
a
resolution
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
socialism
is
the
only
remedy
for
unemployment
and
poverty
the
conclusion
of
harlow
address
was
greeted
with
loud
cheers
from
the
socialists
but
most
of
the
liberal
and
tory
supporters
of
the
present
system
maintained
a
sulky
silence
second
that
resolution
said
easton
i
lay
a
bob
both
ways
remarked
bundy
the
resolution
was
then
put
and
though
the
majority
were
against
it
the
chairman
declared
it
was
carried
unanimously
by
this
time
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
in
a
great
measure
abated
but
as
rain
was
still
falling
it
was
decided
not
to
attempt
to
resume
work
that
day
besides
it
would
have
been
too
late
even
if
the
weather
had
cleared
up
it
just
as
well
it
rained
remarked
one
man
it
some
of
us
might
got
the
sack
tonight
as
it
is
be
hardly
enough
for
all
of
us
to
do
tomorrer
and
saturday
mornin
even
if
it
is
fine
this
was
true
nearly
all
the
outside
was
finished
and
what
remained
to
be
done
was
ready
for
the
final
coat
inside
all
there
was
to
do
was
to
colour
wash
the
walls
and
to
give
the
woodwork
of
the
kitchen
and
scullery
the
last
coat
of
paint
it
was
inevitable
unless
the
firm
had
some
other
work
for
them
to
do
somewhere
else
that
there
would
be
a
great
slaughter
on
saturday
said
philpot
assuming
what
he
meant
to
be
the
manner
of
a
school
teacher
addressing
children
wants
you
hall
to
make
a
speshall
heffort
and
get
very
early
in
the
mornin
say
about
four
and
them
wot
doos
the
most
work
tomorrer
will
get
a
prize
on
saturday
it
be
the
sack
inquired
harlow
replied
philpot
not
honly
will
you
get
a
prize
for
good
conduck
tomorrer
but
if
you
all
keep
on
workin
like
we
bin
doing
lately
till
you
too
hold
and
wore
hout
to
do
any
more
you
be
allowed
to
go
to
a
nice
workhouse
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
and
each
one
of
you
will
be
given
a
title
pauper
and
they
laughed
although
the
majority
of
them
had
mothers
or
fathers
or
other
near
relatives
who
had
already
succeeded
to
the
title
they
laughed
as
they
were
going
home
crass
paused
at
the
gate
and
pointing
up
to
the
large
gable
at
the
end
of
the
house
he
said
to
philpot
want
the
longest
ladder
the
for
that
tomorrow
philpot
looked
up
at
the
gable
it
was
very
high
chapter
the
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
philpot
sawkins
harlow
and
barrington
went
to
the
yard
to
get
the
long
ladder
the
so
called
because
it
had
rungs
it
was
really
what
is
known
as
a
builder
scaffold
ladder
and
it
had
been
strengthened
by
several
iron
bolts
or
rods
which
passed
through
just
under
some
of
the
rungs
one
side
of
the
ladder
had
an
iron
band
or
ribbon
twisted
and
nailed
round
it
spirally
it
was
not
at
all
suitable
for
painters
work
being
altogether
too
heavy
and
cumbrous
however
as
none
of
the
others
were
long
enough
to
reach
the
high
gable
at
the
refuge
they
managed
with
a
struggle
to
get
it
down
from
the
hooks
and
put
it
on
one
of
the
handcarts
and
soon
passed
through
the
streets
of
mean
and
dingy
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
the
yard
and
began
the
ascent
of
the
long
hill
there
had
been
a
lot
of
rain
during
the
night
and
the
sky
was
still
overcast
with
dark
grey
clouds
the
cart
went
heavily
over
the
muddy
road
sawkins
was
at
the
helm
holding
the
end
of
the
ladder
and
steering
the
others
walked
a
little
further
ahead
at
the
sides
of
the
cart
it
was
such
hard
work
that
by
the
time
they
were
up
the
hill
they
were
so
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
that
they
had
to
stop
for
a
rest
is
a
bit
of
all
right
ai
it
remarked
harlow
as
he
took
off
his
cap
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
while
they
rested
they
kept
a
good
look
out
for
rushton
or
hunter
who
were
likely
to
pass
by
at
any
moment
at
first
no
one
made
any
reply
to
harlow
observation
for
they
were
all
out
of
breath
and
philpot
lean
fingers
trembled
violently
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
mate
he
said
despondently
after
a
while
one
way
of
gettin
a
livin
and
there
plenty
better
ways
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
his
rheumatism
was
exceptionally
bad
he
felt
unusually
this
morning
the
gloomy
weather
and
the
prospect
of
a
long
day
of
ladder
work
probably
had
something
to
do
with
it
living
is
right
said
barrington
bitterly
he
also
was
exhausted
with
the
struggle
up
the
hill
and
enraged
by
the
woebegone
appearance
of
poor
old
philpot
who
was
panting
and
quivering
from
the
exertion
they
relapsed
into
silence
the
unaccountable
depression
that
possessed
philpot
deprived
him
of
all
his
usual
jocularity
and
filled
him
with
melancholy
thoughts
he
had
travelled
up
and
down
this
hill
a
great
many
times
before
under
similar
circumstances
and
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
had
half
a
quid
now
for
every
time
he
had
pushed
a
cart
up
this
road
he
would
need
to
do
anyone
out
of
a
job
all
the
rest
of
his
life
the
shop
where
he
had
been
apprenticed
used
to
be
just
down
at
the
bottom
the
place
had
been
pulled
down
years
ago
and
the
ground
was
now
occupied
by
more
pretentious
buildings
not
quite
so
far
down
the
road
on
the
other
side
he
could
see
the
church
where
he
used
to
attend
sunday
school
when
he
was
a
boy
and
where
he
was
married
just
thirty
years
ago
presently
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
he
would
be
able
to
look
across
the
valley
and
see
the
spire
of
the
other
church
the
one
in
the
graveyard
where
all
those
who
were
dear
to
him
had
been
one
by
one
laid
to
rest
he
felt
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
when
the
time
came
to
join
them
there
possibly
in
the
next
world
if
there
were
such
a
place
they
might
all
be
together
once
more
he
was
suddenly
aroused
from
these
thoughts
by
an
exclamation
from
harlow
out
here
comes
rushton
they
immediately
resumed
their
journey
rushton
was
coming
up
the
hill
in
his
with
grinder
sitting
by
his
side
they
passed
so
closely
that
philpot
who
was
on
that
side
of
the
cart
was
splashed
with
mud
from
the
wheels
of
the
trap
some
of
your
chaps
ai
they
remarked
grinder
replied
rushton
doing
a
job
up
this
way
should
thought
it
would
pay
you
better
to
use
a
for
sich
work
as
that
said
grinder
do
use
the
horses
whenever
it
necessary
for
very
big
loads
you
know
answered
rushton
and
added
with
a
laugh
the
donkeys
are
quite
strong
enough
for
such
a
job
as
that
the
struggled
on
up
the
hill
for
about
another
hundred
yards
and
then
they
were
forced
to
halt
again
must
stop
long
you
know
said
harlow
likely
he
gone
to
the
job
and
he
wait
to
see
how
long
it
takes
us
to
get
there
barrington
felt
inclined
to
say
that
in
that
case
rushton
would
have
to
wait
but
he
remained
silent
for
he
remembered
that
although
he
personally
did
not
care
a
brass
button
whether
he
got
the
sack
or
not
the
others
were
not
so
fortunately
circumstanced
while
they
were
resting
another
donkey
passed
by
pushing
another
cart
or
rather
holding
it
back
for
he
was
coming
slowly
down
the
hill
another
heir
of
all
the
ages
another
imperialist
a
degraded
brutalized
wretch
clad
in
filthy
stinking
rags
his
toes
protruding
from
the
rotten
broken
boots
that
were
tied
with
bits
of
string
upon
his
stockingless
feet
the
ramshackle
cart
was
loaded
with
empty
bottles
and
putrid
rags
heaped
loosely
in
the
cart
and
packed
into
a
large
sack
old
coats
and
trousers
dresses
petticoats
and
greasy
mildewed
and
malodorous
as
he
crept
along
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
the
man
gave
utterance
at
intervals
to
uncouth
inarticulate
sounds
another
way
of
gettin
a
livin
said
sawkins
with
a
laugh
as
the
miserable
creature
slunk
past
harlow
also
laughed
and
barrington
regarded
them
curiously
he
thought
it
strange
that
they
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
they
might
some
day
become
like
this
man
themselves
often
wondered
what
they
does
with
all
them
dirty
old
rags
said
philpot
into
paper
replied
harlow
briefly
of
them
are
said
barrington
some
are
manufactured
into
shoddy
cloth
and
made
into
sunday
clothes
for
working
men
all
sorts
of
different
ways
of
gettin
a
livin
remarked
sawkins
after
a
pause
read
in
a
paper
the
other
day
about
a
bloke
wot
goes
about
lookin
for
open
trap
doors
and
cellar
flaps
in
front
of
shops
as
soon
as
he
spotted
one
open
he
used
to
go
and
fall
down
in
it
and
then
he
be
took
to
the
and
when
he
got
better
he
used
to
go
and
threaten
to
bring
a
action
against
the
and
get
damages
and
most
of
used
to
part
up
without
goin
in
front
of
the
judge
at
all
but
one
day
a
slop
was
a
watchin
of
and
seen
chuck
down
one
and
when
they
picked
up
they
found
broke
his
leg
so
they
took
to
the
and
when
he
came
out
and
went
round
to
the
shop
and
started
talkin
about
bringin
a
action
for
damages
the
slop
collared
and
they
give
six
months
i
read
about
that
said
harlow
there
was
another
case
of
a
chap
who
was
run
over
by
a
motor
and
they
tried
to
make
out
as
put
in
the
way
on
purpose
but
got
some
money
out
of
the
swell
it
belonged
to
a
pound
i
think
it
was
only
wish
as
one
of
their
motors
would
run
inter
me
said
philpot
making
a
feeble
attempt
at
a
joke
lay
i
get
some
a
me
own
back
out
of
the
others
laughed
and
harlow
was
about
to
make
some
reply
but
at
that
moment
a
cyclist
appeared
coming
down
the
hill
from
the
direction
of
the
job
it
was
nimrod
so
they
resumed
their
journey
once
more
and
presently
hunter
shot
past
on
his
machine
without
taking
any
notice
of
them
when
they
arrived
they
found
that
rushton
had
not
been
there
at
all
but
nimrod
had
crass
said
that
he
had
kicked
up
no
end
of
a
row
because
they
had
not
called
at
the
yard
at
six
that
morning
for
the
ladder
instead
of
going
for
it
after
breakfast
making
two
journeys
instead
of
one
and
he
had
also
been
ratty
because
the
big
gable
had
not
been
started
the
first
thing
that
morning
they
carried
the
ladder
into
the
garden
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
along
the
side
of
the
house
where
the
gable
was
a
brick
wall
about
eight
feet
high
separated
the
grounds
of
refuge
from
those
of
the
premises
next
door
between
this
wall
and
the
side
wall
of
the
house
was
a
space
about
six
feet
wide
and
this
space
formed
a
kind
of
alley
or
lane
or
passage
along
the
side
of
the
house
they
laid
the
ladder
on
the
ground
along
this
passage
the
was
placed
about
through
just
under
the
centre
of
the
gable
and
as
it
lay
there
the
other
end
of
the
ladder
reached
right
out
to
the
front
railings
next
it
was
necessary
that
two
men
should
go
up
into
the
attic
the
window
of
which
was
just
under
the
point
of
the
gable
and
drop
the
end
of
a
long
rope
down
to
the
others
who
would
tie
it
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
then
two
men
would
stand
on
the
bottom
rung
so
as
to
keep
the
down
and
the
three
others
would
have
to
raise
the
ladder
up
while
the
two
men
up
in
the
attic
hauled
on
the
rope
they
called
bundy
and
his
mate
ned
dawson
to
help
and
it
was
arranged
that
harlow
and
crass
should
stand
on
the
foot
because
they
were
the
heaviest
philpot
bundy
and
barrington
were
to
and
dawson
and
sawkins
were
to
go
up
to
the
attic
and
haul
on
the
rope
the
rope
asked
crass
the
others
looked
blankly
at
him
none
of
them
had
thought
of
bringing
one
from
the
yard
ai
there
one
asked
philpot
of
course
there
ai
one
snarled
crass
you
mean
to
say
as
you
ai
brought
one
then
philpot
stammered
out
something
about
having
thought
there
was
one
at
the
house
already
and
the
others
said
they
had
not
thought
about
it
at
all
what
the
bloody
hell
are
we
to
do
now
cried
crass
angrily
go
to
the
yard
and
get
one
suggested
barrington
can
do
it
in
twenty
minutes
there
and
back
and
a
bloody
fine
row
there
be
if
hunter
was
to
see
you
it
nearly
ten
and
we
ai
made
a
start
on
this
gable
wot
we
ought
to
started
first
thing
this
morning
we
tie
two
or
three
of
those
short
ropes
together
suggested
philpot
that
the
other
two
ladders
was
spliced
with
as
there
was
sure
to
be
a
row
if
they
delayed
long
enough
to
send
to
the
yard
it
was
decided
to
act
on
philpot
suggestion
several
of
the
short
ropes
were
accordingly
tied
together
but
upon
examination
it
was
found
that
some
parts
were
so
weak
that
even
crass
had
to
admit
it
would
be
dangerous
to
attempt
to
haul
the
heavy
ladder
up
with
them
the
only
thing
as
i
can
see
for
it
he
said
that
the
boy
will
to
go
down
to
the
yard
and
get
the
long
rope
it
wo
do
for
anyone
else
to
go
there
been
one
row
already
about
the
waste
of
time
because
we
did
call
at
the
yard
for
the
ladder
at
six
bert
was
down
in
the
basement
of
the
house
limewashing
a
cellar
crass
called
him
up
and
gave
him
the
necessary
instructions
chief
of
which
was
to
get
back
again
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
the
boy
ran
off
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
the
others
went
on
with
their
several
jobs
philpot
returned
to
the
small
gable
he
had
been
painting
before
breakfast
which
he
had
not
quite
finished
as
he
worked
a
sudden
and
unaccountable
terror
took
possession
of
him
he
did
not
want
to
do
that
other
gable
he
felt
too
ill
and
he
almost
resolved
that
he
would
ask
crass
if
he
would
mind
letting
him
do
something
else
there
were
several
younger
men
who
would
not
object
to
doing
it
it
would
be
mere
child
play
to
them
and
barrington
had
already
yesterday
offered
to
change
jobs
with
him
but
then
when
he
thought
of
what
the
probable
consequences
would
be
he
hesitated
to
take
that
course
and
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
through
with
the
work
all
right
he
did
not
want
crass
or
hunter
to
mark
him
as
being
too
old
for
ladder
work
bert
came
back
in
about
half
an
hour
flushed
and
sweating
with
the
weight
of
the
rope
and
with
the
speed
he
had
made
he
delivered
it
to
crass
and
then
returned
to
his
cellar
and
went
on
with
the
limewashing
while
crass
passed
the
word
for
philpot
and
the
others
to
come
and
raise
the
ladder
he
handed
the
rope
to
ned
dawson
who
took
it
up
to
the
attic
accompanied
by
sawkins
arrived
there
they
lowered
one
end
out
of
the
window
down
to
the
others
you
ask
me
said
ned
dawson
who
was
critically
examining
the
strands
of
the
rope
as
he
passed
it
out
through
the
open
window
you
ask
me
i
do
see
as
this
is
much
better
than
the
one
we
made
up
by
tyin
the
short
pieces
together
look
he
indicated
a
part
of
the
rope
that
was
very
frayed
and
worn
another
place
just
as
bad
for
christ
sake
do
say
nothing
about
it
now
replied
sawkins
been
enough
talk
and
waste
of
time
over
this
job
already
ned
made
no
answer
and
the
end
having
by
this
time
reached
the
ground
bundy
made
it
fast
to
the
ladder
about
six
rungs
from
the
top
the
ladder
was
lying
on
the
ground
parallel
to
the
side
of
the
house
the
task
of
raising
it
would
have
been
much
easier
if
they
had
been
able
to
lay
it
at
right
angles
to
the
house
wall
but
this
was
impossible
because
of
the
premises
next
door
and
the
garden
wall
between
the
two
houses
on
account
of
its
having
to
be
raised
in
this
manner
the
men
at
the
top
would
not
be
able
to
get
a
straight
pull
on
the
rope
they
would
have
to
stand
back
in
the
room
without
being
able
to
see
the
ladder
and
the
rope
would
have
to
be
drawn
round
the
corner
of
the
window
rasping
against
the
edge
of
the
stone
sill
and
the
brickwork
the
end
of
the
rope
having
been
made
fast
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
crass
and
harlow
stood
on
the
foot
and
the
other
three
raised
the
top
from
the
ground
as
barrington
was
the
tallest
he
took
the
middle
position
underneath
the
ladder
grasping
the
rungs
philpot
being
on
his
left
and
bundy
on
his
right
each
holding
one
side
of
the
ladder
at
a
signal
from
crass
dawson
and
sawkins
began
to
haul
on
the
rope
and
the
top
of
the
ladder
began
to
rise
slowly
into
the
air
philpot
was
not
of
much
use
at
this
work
which
made
it
all
the
harder
for
the
other
two
who
were
lifting
besides
putting
an
extra
strain
on
the
rope
his
lack
of
strength
and
the
efforts
of
barrington
and
bundy
to
make
up
for
him
caused
the
ladder
to
sway
from
side
to
side
as
it
would
not
have
done
if
they
had
all
been
equally
capable
meanwhile
upstairs
dawson
and
sawkins
although
the
ladder
was
as
yet
only
a
little
more
than
half
the
way
up
noticed
as
they
hauled
and
strained
on
the
rope
that
it
had
worn
a
groove
for
itself
in
the
corner
of
the
brickwork
at
the
side
of
the
window
and
every
now
and
then
although
they
pulled
with
all
their
strength
they
were
not
able
to
draw
in
any
part
of
the
rope
at
all
and
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
those
others
down
below
must
have
let
go
their
hold
altogether
or
ceased
lifting
that
was
what
actually
happened
the
three
men
found
the
weight
so
overpowering
that
once
or
twice
they
were
compelled
to
relax
their
efforts
for
a
few
seconds
and
at
those
times
the
rope
had
to
carry
the
whole
weight
of
the
ladder
and
the
part
of
the
rope
that
had
to
bear
the
greatest
strain
was
the
part
that
chanced
to
be
at
the
angle
of
the
brickwork
at
the
side
of
the
window
and
presently
it
happened
that
one
of
the
frayed
and
worn
places
that
dawson
had
remarked
about
was
just
at
the
angle
during
one
of
those
momentary
pauses
on
one
end
there
hung
the
ponderous
ladder
straining
the
frayed
rope
against
the
corner
of
the
brickwork
and
the
sharp
edge
of
the
stone
sill
at
the
other
end
were
dawson
and
sawkins
pulling
with
all
their
strength
and
in
that
instant
the
rope
snapped
like
a
piece
of
thread
one
end
remained
in
the
hands
of
sawkins
and
dawson
who
reeled
backwards
into
the
room
and
the
other
end
flew
up
into
the
air
writhing
like
the
lash
of
a
gigantic
whip
for
a
moment
the
heavy
ladder
swayed
from
side
to
side
barrington
standing
underneath
with
his
hands
raised
above
his
head
grasping
one
of
the
rungs
struggled
desperately
to
hold
it
up
at
his
right
stood
bundy
also
with
arms
upraised
holding
the
side
and
on
the
left
between
the
ladder
and
the
wall
was
philpot
for
a
brief
space
they
strove
fiercely
to
support
the
overpowering
weight
but
philpot
had
no
strength
and
the
ladder
swaying
over
to
the
left
crashed
down
crushing
him
upon
the
ground
and
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
fell
face
downwards
with
the
ladder
across
his
shoulders
the
side
that
had
the
iron
bands
twisted
round
it
fell
across
the
back
of
his
neck
forcing
his
face
against
the
bricks
at
the
base
of
the
wall
he
uttered
no
cry
and
was
quite
still
with
blood
streaming
from
the
cuts
on
his
face
and
trickling
from
his
ears
barrington
was
also
hurled
to
the
ground
with
his
head
and
arms
under
the
ladder
his
head
and
face
were
cut
and
bleeding
and
he
was
unconscious
none
of
the
others
was
hurt
for
they
had
all
had
time
to
jump
clear
when
the
ladder
fell
their
shouts
soon
brought
all
the
other
men
running
to
the
spot
and
the
ladder
was
quickly
lifted
off
the
two
motionless
figures
at
first
it
seemed
that
philpot
was
dead
but
easton
rushed
off
for
a
neighbouring
doctor
who
came
in
a
few
minutes
he
knelt
down
and
carefully
examined
the
crushed
and
motionless
form
of
philpot
while
the
other
men
stood
by
in
terrified
silence
barrington
who
fortunately
was
but
momentarily
stunned
was
sitting
against
the
wall
and
had
suffered
nothing
more
serious
than
minor
cuts
and
bruises
the
doctor
examination
of
philpot
was
a
very
brief
one
and
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
even
before
he
spoke
they
knew
from
his
manner
that
their
worst
fears
were
realized
philpot
was
dead
chapter
the
ghouls
barrington
did
not
do
any
more
work
that
day
but
before
going
home
he
went
to
the
doctor
house
and
the
latter
dressed
the
cuts
on
his
head
and
arms
philpot
body
was
taken
away
on
the
ambulance
to
the
mortuary
hunter
arrived
at
the
house
shortly
afterwards
and
at
once
began
to
shout
and
bully
because
the
painting
of
the
gable
was
not
yet
commenced
when
he
heard
of
the
accident
he
blamed
them
for
using
the
rope
and
said
they
should
have
asked
for
a
new
one
before
he
went
away
he
had
a
long
private
conversation
with
crass
who
told
him
that
philpot
had
no
relatives
and
that
his
life
was
insured
for
ten
pounds
in
a
society
of
which
crass
was
also
a
member
he
knew
that
philpot
had
arranged
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
the
money
was
to
be
paid
to
the
old
woman
with
whom
he
lodged
who
was
a
very
close
friend
the
result
of
this
confidential
talk
was
that
crass
and
hunter
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
probable
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
trouble
of
attending
to
the
business
of
the
funeral
and
that
crass
as
a
close
friend
of
the
dead
man
and
a
fellow
member
of
the
society
was
the
most
suitable
person
to
take
charge
of
the
business
for
her
he
was
already
slightly
acquainted
with
the
old
lady
so
he
would
go
to
see
her
at
once
and
get
her
authority
to
act
on
her
behalf
of
course
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
much
until
after
the
inquest
but
they
could
get
the
coffin
made
as
hunter
knew
the
mortuary
keeper
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
getting
in
for
a
minute
to
measure
the
corpse
this
matter
having
been
arranged
hunter
departed
to
order
a
new
rope
and
shortly
afterwards
crass
having
made
sure
that
everyone
would
have
plenty
to
do
while
he
was
gone
quietly
slipped
away
to
go
to
see
philpot
landlady
he
went
off
so
secretly
that
the
men
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
away
at
all
until
they
saw
him
come
back
just
before
twelve
the
new
rope
was
brought
to
the
house
about
one
and
this
time
the
ladder
was
raised
without
any
mishap
harlow
was
put
on
to
paint
the
gable
and
he
felt
so
nervous
that
he
was
allowed
to
have
sawkins
to
stand
by
and
hold
the
ladder
all
the
time
everyone
felt
nervous
that
afternoon
and
they
all
went
about
their
work
in
an
unusually
careful
manner
when
bert
had
finished
limewashing
the
cellar
crass
set
him
to
work
outside
painting
the
gate
of
the
side
entrance
while
the
boy
was
thus
occupied
he
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
asked
him
about
the
accident
the
solemn
stranger
was
very
sympathetic
and
inquired
what
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
been
killed
and
whether
he
was
married
bert
informed
him
that
philpot
was
a
widower
and
that
he
had
no
children
well
that
so
much
the
better
is
it
said
the
stranger
shaking
his
head
mournfully
a
dreadful
thing
you
know
when
there
children
left
unprovided
for
you
do
happen
to
know
where
he
lived
do
you
said
bert
mentioning
the
address
and
beginning
to
wonder
what
the
solemn
man
wanted
to
know
for
and
why
he
appeared
to
be
so
sorry
for
philpot
since
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
had
never
known
him
very
much
said
the
man
pulling
out
his
and
making
a
note
of
it
very
much
indeed
good
afternoon
and
he
hurried
off
afternoon
sir
said
bert
and
he
turned
to
resume
his
work
crass
came
along
the
garden
just
as
the
mysterious
stranger
was
disappearing
round
the
corner
did
he
want
said
crass
who
had
seen
the
man
talking
to
bert
do
know
exactly
he
was
asking
about
the
accident
and
whether
joe
left
any
children
and
where
he
lived
he
must
be
a
very
decent
sort
of
chap
i
should
think
he
seems
quite
sorry
about
it
he
does
does
he
said
crass
with
a
peculiar
expression
you
know
who
he
is
replied
the
boy
i
thought
he
was
a
reporter
of
some
paper
ai
no
reporter
that
old
snatchum
the
undertaker
smellin
round
after
a
job
but
out
of
it
this
time
smart
as
thinks
is
barrington
came
back
the
next
morning
to
work
and
at
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
accident
they
said
that
it
was
all
very
well
for
hunter
to
talk
like
that
about
the
rope
but
he
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
it
was
nearly
worn
out
newman
said
that
only
about
three
weeks
previously
when
they
were
raising
a
ladder
at
another
job
he
had
shown
the
rope
to
him
and
misery
had
replied
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
several
others
besides
newman
claimed
to
have
mentioned
the
matter
to
hunter
and
each
of
them
said
he
had
received
the
same
sort
of
reply
but
when
barrington
suggested
that
they
should
attend
the
inquest
and
give
evidence
to
that
effect
they
all
became
suddenly
silent
and
in
a
conversation
barrington
afterwards
had
with
newman
the
latter
pointed
out
that
if
he
were
to
do
so
it
would
do
no
good
to
philpot
it
would
not
bring
him
back
but
it
would
be
sure
to
do
himself
a
lot
of
harm
he
would
never
get
another
job
at
and
probably
many
of
the
other
employers
would
him
as
well
if
you
say
anything
about
it
concluded
newman
bring
my
name
into
it
barrington
was
constrained
to
admit
that
all
things
considered
it
was
right
for
newman
to
mind
his
own
business
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
urge
him
or
anyone
else
to
do
or
say
anything
that
would
injure
themselves
misery
came
to
the
house
about
eleven
and
informed
several
of
the
hands
that
as
work
was
very
slack
they
would
get
their
back
day
at
pay
time
he
said
that
the
firm
had
tendered
for
one
or
two
jobs
so
they
could
call
round
about
wednesday
and
perhaps
he
might
then
be
able
to
give
some
of
them
another
start
barrington
was
not
one
of
those
who
were
off
although
he
had
expected
to
be
on
account
of
the
speech
he
had
made
at
the
beano
and
everyone
said
that
he
would
have
got
the
push
sure
enough
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
accident
before
he
went
away
nimrod
instructed
owen
and
crass
to
go
to
the
yard
at
once
they
would
there
find
payne
the
carpenter
who
was
making
philpot
coffin
which
would
be
ready
for
crass
to
varnish
by
the
time
they
got
there
misery
told
owen
that
he
had
left
the
coffin
plate
and
the
instructions
with
payne
and
added
that
he
was
not
to
take
too
much
time
over
the
writing
because
it
was
a
very
cheap
job
when
they
arrived
at
the
yard
payne
was
just
finishing
the
coffin
which
was
of
elm
all
that
remained
to
be
done
to
it
was
the
pitching
of
the
joints
inside
and
payne
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
pot
of
boiling
pitch
off
the
fire
to
do
this
as
it
was
such
a
cheap
job
there
was
no
time
to
polish
it
properly
so
crass
proceeded
to
give
it
a
couple
of
coats
of
spirit
varnish
and
while
he
was
doing
this
owen
wrote
the
plate
which
was
made
of
very
thin
zinc
lacquered
over
to
make
it
look
like
brass
joseph
philpot
died
september
aged
years
the
inquest
was
held
on
the
following
monday
morning
and
as
both
rushton
and
hunter
thought
it
possible
that
barrington
might
attempt
to
impute
some
blame
to
them
they
had
worked
the
oracle
and
had
contrived
to
have
several
friends
of
their
own
put
on
the
jury
there
was
however
no
need
for
their
alarm
because
barrington
could
not
say
that
he
had
himself
noticed
or
called
hunter
attention
to
the
state
of
the
rope
and
he
did
not
wish
to
mention
the
names
of
the
others
without
their
permission
the
evidence
of
crass
and
the
other
men
who
were
called
was
to
the
effect
that
it
was
a
pure
accident
none
of
them
had
noticed
that
the
rope
was
unsound
hunter
also
swore
that
he
did
not
know
of
it
none
of
the
men
had
ever
called
his
attention
to
it
if
they
had
done
so
he
would
have
procured
a
new
one
immediately
philpot
landlady
and
mr
rushton
were
also
called
as
witnesses
and
the
end
was
that
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
and
added
that
they
did
not
think
any
blame
attached
to
anyone
the
coroner
discharged
the
jury
and
as
they
and
the
witnesses
passed
out
of
the
room
hunter
followed
rushton
outside
with
the
hope
of
being
honoured
by
a
little
conversation
with
him
on
the
satisfactory
issue
of
the
case
but
rushton
went
off
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
so
hunter
returned
to
the
room
where
the
court
had
been
held
to
get
the
coroner
certificate
authorizing
the
interment
of
the
body
this
document
is
usually
handed
to
the
friends
of
the
deceased
or
to
the
undertaker
acting
for
them
when
hunter
got
back
to
the
room
he
found
that
during
his
absence
the
coroner
had
given
it
to
landlady
who
had
taken
it
with
her
he
accordingly
hastened
outside
again
to
ask
her
for
it
but
the
woman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
crass
and
the
other
men
were
also
gone
they
had
hurried
off
to
return
to
work
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
hunter
decided
that
it
did
not
matter
much
about
the
certificate
crass
had
arranged
the
business
with
the
landlady
and
he
could
get
the
paper
from
her
later
on
having
come
to
this
conclusion
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
he
had
several
prices
to
work
out
that
afternoon
estimates
from
some
jobs
the
firm
was
going
to
tender
for
that
evening
after
having
been
home
to
tea
crass
and
sawkins
met
by
appointment
at
the
carpenter
shop
to
take
the
coffin
to
the
mortuary
where
misery
had
arranged
to
meet
them
at
half
past
eight
hunter
plan
was
to
have
the
funeral
take
place
from
the
mortuary
which
was
only
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
from
the
yard
so
tonight
they
were
just
going
to
lift
in
the
body
and
get
the
lid
screwed
down
it
was
blowing
hard
and
raining
heavily
when
crass
and
sawkins
set
out
carrying
the
coffin
covered
with
a
black
cloth
on
their
shoulders
they
also
took
a
small
pair
of
tressels
for
the
coffin
to
stand
on
crass
carried
one
of
these
slung
over
his
arm
and
sawkins
the
other
on
their
way
they
had
to
pass
the
and
the
place
looked
so
inviting
that
they
decided
to
stop
and
have
a
drink
just
to
keep
the
damp
out
and
as
they
could
not
very
well
take
the
coffin
inside
with
them
they
stood
it
up
against
the
brick
wall
a
little
way
from
the
side
of
the
door
as
crass
remarked
with
a
laugh
there
was
not
much
danger
of
anyone
pinching
it
the
old
dear
served
them
and
just
as
they
finished
drinking
the
two
there
was
a
loud
crash
outside
and
crass
and
sawkins
rushed
out
and
found
that
the
coffin
had
blown
down
and
was
lying
bottom
upwards
across
the
pavement
while
the
black
cloth
that
had
been
wrapped
round
it
was
out
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
road
having
recovered
this
they
shook
as
much
of
the
dirt
off
as
they
could
and
having
wrapped
it
round
the
coffin
again
they
resumed
their
journey
to
the
mortuary
where
they
found
hunter
waiting
for
them
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
keeper
the
electric
light
was
switched
on
and
as
crass
and
sawkins
came
in
they
saw
that
the
marble
slab
was
empty
the
corpse
was
gone
came
this
afternoon
with
a
and
a
corfin
explained
the
keeper
was
out
at
the
time
and
the
missis
thought
it
was
all
right
so
she
let
him
have
the
key
hunter
and
crass
looked
blankly
at
each
other
this
takes
the
biskit
said
the
latter
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
thought
you
said
you
had
settled
everything
all
right
with
the
old
woman
said
hunter
i
did
replied
crass
seen
on
friday
and
i
told
to
leave
it
all
to
me
to
attend
to
and
she
said
she
would
i
told
that
philpot
said
to
me
that
if
ever
anything
to
i
was
to
take
charge
of
everything
for
because
i
was
best
friend
and
i
told
we
do
it
as
cheap
as
possible
it
seems
to
me
as
you
bungled
it
somehow
said
nimrod
gloomily
ought
to
have
gone
and
seen
myself
i
was
afraid
you
make
a
mess
of
it
he
added
in
a
wailing
tone
always
the
same
everything
that
i
do
attend
to
myself
goes
wrong
an
uncomfortable
silence
fell
crass
thought
that
the
principal
piece
of
bungling
in
this
affair
was
hunter
failure
to
secure
possession
of
the
coroner
certificate
after
the
inquest
but
he
was
afraid
to
say
so
outside
the
rain
was
still
falling
and
drove
in
through
the
partly
open
door
causing
the
atmosphere
of
the
mortuary
to
be
even
more
than
usually
cold
and
damp
the
empty
coffin
had
been
reared
against
one
of
the
walls
and
the
marble
slab
was
still
stained
with
blood
for
the
keeper
had
not
had
time
to
clean
it
since
the
body
had
been
removed
can
see
it
been
worked
said
crass
at
last
one
of
the
members
of
the
club
who
works
for
snatchum
and
took
it
on
to
give
the
order
for
the
funeral
but
got
no
right
to
do
it
or
no
right
done
it
replied
misery
you
better
take
the
box
back
to
the
shop
crass
and
sawkins
accordingly
returned
to
the
workshop
where
they
were
presently
joined
by
nimrod
been
thinking
this
business
over
as
i
came
along
he
said
i
do
see
being
beat
like
this
by
snatchum
so
you
two
can
just
put
the
tressels
and
the
box
on
a
hand
cart
and
we
take
it
over
to
philpot
house
nimrod
walked
on
the
pavement
while
the
other
two
pushed
the
cart
and
it
was
about
half
past
nine
when
they
arrived
at
the
street
in
windley
where
philpot
used
to
live
they
halted
in
a
dark
part
of
the
street
a
few
yards
away
from
the
house
and
on
the
opposite
side
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
said
misery
for
me
and
sawkins
to
wait
while
you
go
to
the
and
see
the
land
lies
you
done
all
the
business
with
so
far
it
no
use
takin
the
box
unless
we
know
the
corpse
is
there
for
all
we
know
snatchum
may
taken
it
with
i
think
that
be
the
best
way
agreed
crass
after
a
thought
nimrod
and
sawkins
accordingly
took
shelter
in
the
doorway
of
an
empty
house
leaving
the
handcart
at
the
kerb
while
crass
went
across
the
street
and
knocked
at
philpot
door
they
saw
it
opened
by
an
elderly
woman
holding
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
then
crass
went
inside
and
the
door
was
shut
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
reappeared
and
leaving
the
door
partly
open
behind
him
he
came
out
and
crossed
over
to
where
the
others
were
waiting
as
he
drew
near
they
could
see
that
he
carried
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
all
right
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
he
came
up
i
got
the
stifficut
misery
took
the
paper
eagerly
and
scanned
it
by
the
light
of
a
match
that
crass
struck
it
was
the
certificate
right
enough
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
hunter
put
it
into
his
and
stowed
it
safely
away
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
while
crass
explained
the
result
of
his
errand
it
appeared
that
the
other
member
of
the
society
accompanied
by
snatchum
had
called
upon
the
old
woman
and
had
bluffed
her
into
giving
them
the
order
for
the
funeral
it
was
they
who
had
put
her
up
to
getting
the
certificate
from
the
coroner
they
had
been
careful
to
keep
away
from
the
inquest
themselves
so
as
not
to
arouse
hunter
or
crass
suspicions
they
brought
the
body
this
afternoon
crass
went
on
tried
to
get
the
stifficut
orf
but
she
been
things
over
and
she
was
a
bit
frightened
she
knowed
she
made
arrangements
with
me
and
she
thought
she
better
see
me
first
so
she
told
she

it
to

thursday
that
the
day
as
was
goin
to
the
funeral

day
too
late

with
a
ghastly
grin
get
the
job
done
on
wednesday
did
want
to
give
it
to
me
at
first
crass
concluded
i
told
we
see
right
if
old
snatchum
tried
to
make
pay
for
the
other
coffin
do
think
he
likely
to
make
much
fuss
about
it
said
hunter
wo
want
everybody
to
know
he
was
so
anxious
for
the
job
crass
and
sawkins
pushed
the
handcart
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
then
lifting
the
coffin
off
they
carried
it
into
the
house
nimrod
going
first
the
old
woman
was
waiting
for
them
with
the
candle
at
the
end
of
the
passage
shall
be
very
glad
when
it
all
over
she
said
as
she
led
the
way
up
the
narrow
stairs
closely
followed
by
hunter
who
carried
the
tressels
crass
and
sawkins
bringing
up
the
rear
with
the
coffin
shall
be
very
glad
when
it
all
over
for
i
sick
and
tired
of
answerin
the
door
to
undertakers
if
there
been
one
since
friday
there
been
a
dozen
all
after
the
job
not
to
mention
all
the
cards
what

put
under
the
door
besides
the
one
what
i
had
give
to
me
by
different
people
i
had
a
pair
of
boots
bein
mended
and
the
man
took
the
trouble
to
bring
when
they
was
finished
a
thing
never
done
before
just
for
an
excuse
to
give
me
an
undertaker
card
the
milkman
brought
one
and
so
did
the
baker
and
the
greengrocer
give
me
another
when
i
went
in
there
on
saturday
to
buy
some
vegetables
for
sunday
dinner
arrived
at
the
top
landing
the
old
woman
opened
a
door
and
entered
a
small
and
wretchedly
furnished
room
across
the
lower
sash
of
the
window
hung
a
tattered
piece
of
lace
curtain
the
low
ceiling
was
cracked
and
discoloured
there
was
a
rickety
little
wooden
washstand
and
along
one
side
of
the
room
a
narrow
bed
covered
with
a
ragged
grey
quilt
on
which
lay
a
bundle
containing
the
clothes
that
the
dead
man
was
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
accident
there
was
a
little
table
in
front
of
the
window
with
a
small
upon
it
and
a
chair
was
placed
by
the
bedside
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
faded
piece
of
carpet
of
no
perceptible
pattern
worn
into
holes
in
several
places
in
the
middle
of
this
dreary
room
upon
a
pair
of
tressels
was
the
coffin
containing
philpot
body
seen
by
the
dim
and
flickering
light
of
the
candle
the
aspect
of
this
coffin
covered
over
with
a
white
sheet
was
terrible
in
its
silent
pathetic
solitude
hunter
placed
the
pair
of
tressels
he
had
been
carrying
against
the
wall
and
the
other
two
put
the
empty
coffin
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
bed
the
old
woman
stood
the
candlestick
on
the
mantelpiece
and
withdrew
remarking
that
they
would
not
need
her
assistance
the
three
men
then
removed
their
overcoats
and
laid
them
on
the
end
of
the
bed
and
from
the
pocket
of
his
crass
took
out
two
large
screwdrivers
one
of
which
he
handed
to
hunter
sawkins
held
the
candle
while
they
unscrewed
and
took
off
the
lid
of
the
coffin
they
had
brought
with
them
it
was
not
quite
empty
for
they
had
brought
a
bag
of
tools
inside
it
think
we
shall
be
able
to
work
better
if
we
takes
the
other
one
orf
the
trussels
and
puts
it
on
the
floor
remarked
crass
i
think
so
too
replied
hunter
crass
took
off
the
sheet
and
threw
it
on
the
bed
revealing
the
other
coffin
which
was
very
similar
in
appearance
to
the
one
they
had
brought
with
them
being
of
elms
with
the
usual
imitation
brass
furniture
hunter
took
hold
of
the
head
and
crass
the
foot
and
they
lifted
it
off
the
tressels
on
to
the
floor
not
very
that
one
good
thing
observed
hunter
always
was
a
very
thin
chap
replied
crass
the
screws
that
held
down
the
lid
had
been
covered
over
with
brass
nails
which
had
to
be
wrenched
off
before
they
could
get
at
the
screws
of
which
there
were
eight
altogether
it
was
evident
from
the
appearance
of
the
beads
of
these
screws
that
they
were
old
ones
that
had
been
used
for
some
purpose
before
they
were
rusty
and
of
different
sizes
some
being
rather
larger
or
smaller
than
they
should
have
been
they
were
screwed
in
so
firmly
that
by
the
time
they
had
drawn
half
of
them
out
the
two
men
were
streaming
with
perspiration
after
a
while
hunter
took
the
candle
from
sawkins
and
the
latter
had
a
try
at
the
screws
would
think
the
dam
things
had
been
there
for
a
years
remarked
hunter
savagely
as
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
and
neck
with
his
handkerchief
kneeling
on
the
lid
of
the
coffin
and
panting
and
grunting
with
the
exertion
the
other
two
continued
to
struggle
with
their
task
suddenly
crass
uttered
an
obscene
curse
he
had
broken
off
one
side
of
the
head
of
the
screw
he
was
trying
to
turn
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
similar
misfortune
happened
to
sawkins
after
this
hunter
again
took
a
screwdriver
himself
and
when
they
got
all
the
screws
out
with
the
exception
of
the
two
broken
ones
crass
took
a
hammer
and
chisel
out
of
the
bag
and
proceeded
to
cut
off
what
was
left
of
the
tops
of
the
two
that
remained
but
even
after
this
was
done
the
two
screws
still
held
the
lid
on
the
coffin
and
so
they
had
to
hammer
the
end
of
the
blade
of
the
chisel
underneath
and
lever
the
lid
up
so
that
they
could
get
hold
of
it
with
their
fingers
it
split
up
one
side
as
they
tore
it
off
exposing
the
dead
man
to
view
although
the
marks
of
the
cuts
and
bruises
were
still
visible
on
philpot
face
they
were
softened
down
by
the
pallor
of
death
and
a
placid
peaceful
expression
pervaded
his
features
his
hands
were
crossed
upon
his
breast
and
as
he
lay
there
in
the
grave
clothes
almost
covered
in
by
the
white
lace
frill
that
bordered
the
sides
of
the
coffin
he
looked
like
one
in
a
profound
and
tranquil
sleep
they
laid
the
broken
lid
on
the
bed
and
placed
the
two
coffins
side
by
side
on
the
floor
as
close
together
as
possible
sawkins
stood
at
one
side
holding
the
candle
in
his
left
hand
and
ready
to
render
with
his
right
any
assistance
that
might
unexpectedly
prove
to
be
necessary
crass
standing
at
the
foot
took
hold
of
the
body
by
the
ankles
while
hunter
at
the
other
end
seized
it
by
the
shoulders
with
his
huge
clawlike
hands
which
resembled
the
talons
of
some
obscene
bird
of
prey
and
they
dragged
it
out
and
placed
it
in
the
other
coffin
whilst
hunter
hovering
ghoulishly
over
the
corpse
arranged
the
grave
clothes
and
the
frilling
crass
laid
the
broken
cover
on
the
top
of
the
other
coffin
and
pushed
it
under
the
bed
out
of
the
way
then
he
selected
the
necessary
screws
and
nails
from
the
bag
and
hunter
having
by
this
time
finished
they
proceeded
to
screw
down
the
lid
then
they
lifted
the
coffin
on
to
the
tressels
covering
it
over
with
the
sheet
and
the
appearance
it
then
presented
was
so
exactly
similar
to
what
they
had
seen
when
they
first
entered
the
room
that
it
caused
the
same
thought
to
occur
to
all
of
them
suppose
snatchum
took
it
into
his
head
to
come
there
and
take
the
body
out
again
if
he
were
to
do
so
and
take
it
up
to
the
cemetery
they
might
be
compelled
to
give
up
the
certificate
to
him
and
then
all
their
trouble
would
be
lost
after
a
brief
consultation
they
resolved
that
it
would
be
safer
to
take
the
corpse
on
the
handcart
to
the
yard
and
keep
it
in
the
carpenter
shop
until
the
funeral
which
could
take
place
from
there
crass
and
sawkins
accordingly
lifted
the
coffin
off
the
tressels
and
while
hunter
held
the
light
proceeded
to
carry
it
downstairs
a
task
of
considerable
difficulty
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
staircase
and
the
landing
however
they
got
it
down
at
last
and
having
put
it
on
the
handcart
covered
it
over
with
the
black
wrapper
it
was
still
raining
and
the
lamp
in
the
cart
was
nearly
out
so
sawkins
trimmed
the
wick
and
relit
it
before
they
started
hunter
wished
them
at
the
corner
of
the
street
because
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
accompany
them
to
the
yard
they
would
be
able
to
manage
all
that
remained
to
be
done
by
themselves
he
said
he
would
make
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
as
soon
as
he
possibly
could
the
next
morning
and
he
would
come
to
the
job
and
let
them
know
as
soon
as
he
knew
himself
at
what
time
they
would
have
to
be
in
attendance
to
act
as
bearers
he
had
gone
a
little
distance
on
his
way
when
he
stopped
and
turned
back
to
them
not
necessary
for
either
of
you
to
make
a
song
about
this
business
you
know
he
said
the
two
men
said
that
they
quite
understood
that
he
could
depend
on
their
keeping
their
mouths
shut
when
hunter
had
gone
crass
drew
out
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
a
little
way
down
the
road
the
lights
of
a
public
house
were
gleaming
through
the
mist
shall
be
just
in
time
to
get
a
drink
before
closing
time
if
we
buck
up
he
said
and
with
this
object
they
hurried
on
as
fast
as
they
could
when
they
reached
the
tavern
they
left
the
cart
standing
by
the
kerb
and
went
inside
where
crass
ordered
two
pints
of
which
he
permitted
sawkins
to
pay
for
are
we
going
on
about
this
job
inquired
the
latter
after
they
had
each
taken
a
long
drink
for
they
were
thirsty
after
their
exertions
reckon
we
ought
to
more
than
a
bob
for
it
you
it
not
like
a
ordinary
lift
in
course
it
ai
replied
crass
ought
to
about
say
reflecting
arf
a
dollar
each
at
the
very
least
enough
too
said
sawkins
was
going
to
say
arf
a
crown
myself
crass
agreed
that
even
half
a
crown
would
not
be
too
much
are
we
going
on
about
chargin
it
on
our
time
sheets
asked
sawkins
after
a
pause
we
just
put
a
lift
in
they
might
only
pay
us
a
bob
as
usual
as
a
rule
when
they
had
taken
a
coffin
home
they
wrote
on
their
time
sheets
lift
in
for
which
they
were
usually
paid
one
shilling
unless
it
happened
to
be
a
very
funeral
when
they
sometimes
got
one
and
sixpence
they
were
never
paid
by
the
hour
for
these
jobs
crass
smoked
reflectively
think
the
best
way
will
be
to
put
it
like
this
he
said
at
length
philpot
funeral
one
lift
out
and
one
lift
in
also
takin
corpse
to
carpenter
shop
would
that
do
sawkins
said
that
would
be
a
very
good
way
to
put
it
and
they
finished
their
beer
just
as
the
landlord
intimated
that
it
was
closing
time
the
cart
was
standing
where
they
left
it
the
black
cloth
saturated
with
the
rain
which
dripped
mournfully
from
its
sable
folds
when
they
reached
the
plot
of
waste
ground
over
which
they
had
to
pass
in
order
to
reach
the
gates
of
the
yard
they
had
to
proceed
very
cautiously
for
it
was
very
dark
and
the
lantern
did
not
give
much
light
a
number
of
carts
and
lorries
were
standing
there
and
the
path
wound
through
pools
of
water
and
heaps
of
refuse
after
much
difficulty
and
jolting
they
reached
the
gate
which
crass
unlocked
with
the
key
he
had
obtained
from
the
office
earlier
in
the
evening
they
soon
opened
the
door
of
the
carpenter
shop
and
after
lighting
the
gas
they
arranged
the
tressels
and
then
brought
in
the
coffin
and
placed
it
upon
them
then
they
locked
the
door
and
placed
the
key
in
its
usual
but
the
key
of
the
outer
gate
they
took
with
them
and
dropped
into
the
at
the
office
which
they
had
to
pass
on
their
way
home
as
they
turned
away
from
the
door
they
were
suddenly
confronted
by
a
policeman
who
flashed
his
lantern
in
their
faces
and
demanded
to
know
why
they
had
tried
the
lock
the
next
morning
was
a
very
busy
one
for
hunter
who
had
to
see
several
new
jobs
commenced
they
were
all
small
affairs
most
of
them
would
only
take
two
or
three
days
from
start
to
finish
attending
to
this
work
occupied
most
of
his
morning
but
all
the
same
he
managed
to
do
the
necessary
business
connected
with
the
funeral
which
he
arranged
to
take
place
at
two
on
wednesday
afternoon
from
the
mortuary
where
the
coffin
had
been
removed
during
the
day
hunter
deciding
that
it
would
not
look
well
to
have
the
funeral
start
from
the
workshop
although
hunter
had
kept
it
as
quiet
as
possible
there
was
a
small
crowd
including
several
old
workmates
of
philpot
who
happened
to
be
out
of
work
waiting
outside
the
mortuary
to
see
the
funeral
start
and
amongst
them
were
bill
bates
and
the
who
were
both
sober
barrington
and
owen
were
also
there
having
left
work
for
the
day
in
order
to
go
to
the
funeral
they
were
there
too
in
a
sense
as
the
representatives
of
the
other
workmen
for
barrington
carried
a
large
wreath
which
had
been
subscribed
for
voluntarily
by
rushton
men
they
could
not
all
afford
to
lose
the
time
to
attend
the
funeral
although
most
of
them
would
have
liked
to
pay
that
tribute
of
regard
to
their
old
mate
so
they
had
done
this
as
the
next
best
thing
attached
to
the
wreath
was
a
strip
of
white
satin
ribbon
upon
which
owen
had
painted
a
suitable
inscription
promptly
at
two
the
hearse
and
the
mourning
coach
drove
up
with
hunter
and
the
four
bearers
crass
slyme
payne
and
sawkins
all
dressed
in
black
with
frock
coats
and
silk
hats
although
they
were
nominally
attired
in
the
same
way
there
was
a
remarkable
dissimilarity
in
their
appearance
crass
coat
was
of
smooth
intensely
black
cloth
having
been
recently
dyed
and
his
hat
was
rather
low
in
the
crown
being
of
that
shape
that
curved
outwards
towards
the
top
hunter
coat
was
a
kind
of
serge
with
a
rather
rusty
cast
of
colour
and
his
hat
was
very
tall
and
straight
slightly
narrower
at
the
crown
than
at
the
brim
as
for
the
others
each
of
them
had
a
hat
of
a
different
fashion
and
date
and
their
clothes
ranged
from
rusty
brown
to
dark
blue
these
differences
were
due
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
garments
had
been
purchased
at
different
times
from
different
clothes
shops
and
never
being
used
except
on
such
occasions
as
the
present
they
lasted
for
an
indefinite
time
when
the
coffin
was
brought
out
and
placed
in
the
hearse
hunter
laid
upon
it
the
wreath
that
barrington
gave
him
together
with
the
another
he
had
brought
himself
which
had
a
similar
ribbon
with
the
words
rushton
with
deep
sympathy
seeing
that
barrington
and
owen
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
carriage
bill
bates
and
the
came
up
to
the
door
and
asked
if
there
was
any
objection
to
their
coming
and
as
neither
owen
nor
barrington
objected
they
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
ask
anyone
else
permission
so
they
got
in
meanwhile
hunter
had
taken
his
position
a
few
yards
in
front
of
the
hearse
and
the
bearers
each
his
proper
position
two
on
each
side
as
the
procession
turned
into
the
main
road
they
saw
snatchum
standing
at
the
corner
looking
very
gloomy
hunter
kept
his
eyes
fixed
straight
ahead
and
affected
not
to
see
him
but
crass
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
indulge
in
a
jeering
smile
which
so
enraged
snatchum
that
he
shouted
out
do
matter
i
sha
lose
much
i
can
use
it
for
someone
else
the
distance
to
the
cemetery
was
about
three
miles
so
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
the
busy
streets
of
the
town
hunter
called
a
halt
and
got
up
on
the
hearse
beside
the
driver
crass
sat
on
the
other
side
and
two
of
the
other
bearers
stood
in
the
space
behind
the
driver
seat
the
fourth
getting
up
beside
the
driver
of
the
coach
and
then
they
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
as
they
drew
near
to
the
cemetery
they
slowed
down
and
finally
stopped
when
about
fifty
yards
from
the
gate
then
hunter
and
the
bearers
resumed
their
former
position
and
they
passed
through
the
open
gate
and
up
to
the
door
of
the
church
where
they
were
received
by
the
clerk
a
man
in
a
rusty
black
cassock
who
stood
by
while
they
carried
the
coffin
in
and
placed
it
on
a
kind
of
elevated
table
which
revolved
on
a
pivot
they
brought
it
in
footfirst
and
as
soon
as
they
had
placed
it
upon
the
table
the
clerk
swung
it
round
so
as
to
bring
the
foot
of
the
coffin
towards
the
door
ready
to
be
carried
out
again
there
was
a
special
pew
set
apart
for
the
undertakers
and
in
this
hunter
and
the
bearers
took
their
seats
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
clergyman
barrington
and
the
three
others
sat
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
no
altar
or
pulpit
in
this
church
but
a
kind
of
reading
desk
stood
on
a
slightly
raised
platform
at
the
other
end
of
the
aisle
after
a
wait
of
about
ten
minutes
the
clergyman
entered
and
at
once
proceeding
to
the
desk
began
to
recite
in
a
rapid
and
wholly
unintelligible
manner
the
usual
office
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
each
of
his
hearers
had
a
copy
of
the
words
for
there
was
a
little
book
in
each
pew
none
of
them
would
have
been
able
to
gather
the
sense
of
what
the
man
was
gabbling
under
any
other
circumstances
the
spectacle
of
a
human
being
mouthing
in
this
absurd
way
would
have
compelled
laughter
and
so
would
the
suggestion
that
this
individual
really
believed
that
he
was
addressing
the
supreme
being
his
attitude
and
manner
were
contemptuously
indifferent
while
he
recited
intoned
or
gabbled
the
words
of
the
office
he
was
reading
the
certificate
and
some
other
paper
the
clerk
had
placed
upon
the
desk
and
when
he
had
finished
reading
these
his
gaze
wandered
abstractedly
round
the
chapel
resting
for
a
long
time
with
an
expression
of
curiosity
upon
bill
bates
and
the
who
were
doing
their
best
to
follow
in
their
books
the
words
he
was
repeating
he
next
turned
his
attention
to
his
fingers
holding
his
hand
away
from
him
nearly
at
arm
length
and
critically
examining
the
nails
from
time
to
time
as
this
miserable
mockery
proceeded
the
clerk
in
the
rusty
black
cassock
mechanically
droned
out
a
sonorous
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
lesson
the
clergyman
went
out
of
the
church
taking
a
short
cut
through
the
and
monuments
while
the
bearers
again
shouldered
the
coffin
and
followed
the
clerk
to
the
grave
when
they
arrived
within
a
few
yards
of
their
destination
they
were
rejoined
by
the
clergyman
who
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
paths
he
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
procession
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
and
as
they
walked
slowly
along
he
resumed
his
reading
or
repetition
of
the
words
of
the
service
he
had
on
an
old
black
cassock
and
a
much
soiled
and
slightly
torn
surplice
the
unseemly
appearance
of
this
dirty
garment
was
heightened
by
the
circumstance
that
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
adjust
it
properly
it
hung
all
showing
about
six
inches
more
of
the
black
cassock
underneath
one
side
than
the
other
however
perhaps
it
is
not
right
to
criticize
this
person
appearance
so
severely
because
the
poor
fellow
was
paid
only
for
each
burial
and
as
this
was
only
the
fourth
funeral
he
had
officiated
at
that
day
probably
he
could
not
afford
to
wear
clean
linen
at
any
rate
not
for
the
funerals
of
the
lower
classes
he
continued
his
unintelligible
jargon
while
they
were
lowering
the
coffin
into
the
grave
and
those
who
happened
to
know
the
words
of
the
office
by
heart
were
with
some
difficulty
able
to
understand
what
he
was
saying
as
it
hath
pleased
almighty
god
of
his
great
mercy
to
take
unto
himself
the
soul
of
our
dear
brother
here
departed
we
therefore
commit
his
body
to
the
ground
earth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
the
earth
fell
from
the
clerk
hand
and
rattled
on
the
lid
of
the
coffin
with
a
mournful
sound
and
when
the
clergyman
had
finished
repeating
the
remainder
of
the
service
he
turned
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
church
hunter
and
the
rest
of
the
funeral
party
made
their
way
back
towards
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
where
the
hearse
and
the
carriage
were
waiting
on
their
way
they
saw
another
funeral
procession
coming
towards
them
it
was
a
very
closed
hearse
with
only
one
horse
there
was
no
undertaker
in
front
and
no
bearers
walked
by
the
sides
it
was
a
pauper
funeral
three
men
evidently
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
followed
behind
the
hearse
as
they
reached
the
church
door
four
old
men
who
were
dressed
in
ordinary
everyday
clothes
came
forward
and
opening
the
hearse
took
out
the
coffin
and
carried
it
into
the
church
followed
by
the
other
three
who
were
evidently
relatives
of
the
deceased
the
four
old
men
were
paupers
inmates
of
the
workhouse
who
were
paid
sixpence
each
for
acting
as
bearers
they
were
just
taking
out
the
coffin
from
the
hearse
as
hunter
party
was
passing
and
most
of
the
latter
paused
for
a
moment
and
watched
them
carry
it
into
the
church
the
roughly
made
coffin
was
of
white
deal
not
painted
or
covered
in
any
way
and
devoid
of
any
fittings
or
ornament
with
the
exception
of
a
square
piece
of
zinc
on
the
lid
none
of
rushton
party
was
near
enough
to
recognize
any
of
the
mourners
or
to
read
what
was
written
on
the
zinc
but
if
they
had
been
they
would
have
seen
roughly

aged
and
some
of
them
would
have
recognized
the
three
mourners
who
were
jack
linden
sons
as
for
the
bearers
they
were
all
retired
working
men
who
had
come
into
their

chapter
the
wise
men
of
the
east
at
the
end
of
the
following
week
there
was
a
terrible
slaughter
at
rushton
barrington
and
all
the
casual
hands
were
sacked
including
newman
easton
and
harlow
and
there
was
so
little
work
that
it
looked
as
if
everyone
else
would
have
to
stand
off
also
the
summer
was
practically
over
so
those
who
were
stood
off
had
but
a
poor
chance
of
getting
a
start
anywhere
else
because
most
other
firms
were
discharging
hands
as
well
there
was
only
one
other
shop
in
the
town
that
was
doing
anything
at
all
to
speak
of
and
that
was
the
firm
of
dauber
and
botchit
this
firm
had
come
very
much
to
the
front
during
the
summer
and
had
captured
several
big
jobs
that
rushton
had
expected
to
get
besides
taking
away
several
of
the
latter
old
customers
this
firm
took
work
at
almost
half
the
price
that
rushton
could
do
it
for
and
they
had
a
foreman
whose
little
finger
was
thicker
than
nimrod
thigh
some
of
the
men
who
had
worked
for
both
firms
during
the
summer
said
that
after
working
for
dauber
and
botchit
working
for
rushton
seemed
like
having
a
holiday
one
bloke
there
said
newman
in
conversation
with
harlow
and
easton
one
bloke
there
wot
puts
up
rolls
paper
in
a
day
an
trims
and
pastes
for
and
as
for
the
painters
nearly
everyone
of
gets
over
as
much
work
as
us
three
put
together
and
if
you
working
there
you
got
to
do
the
same
or
get
the
sack
however
much
truth
or
falsehood
or
exaggeration
there
may
have
been
in
the
stories
of
the
sweating
and
driving
that
prevailed
at
dauber
and
botchit
it
was
an
indisputable
fact
that
the
other
builders
found
it
very
difficult
to
compete
with
them
and
between
the
lot
of
them
what
work
there
was
to
do
was
all
finished
or
messed
up
in
about
a
quarter
of
the
time
that
it
would
have
taken
to
do
it
properly
by
the
end
of
september
there
were
great
numbers
of
men
out
of
employment
and
the
practical
persons
who
controlled
the
town
were
already
preparing
to
enact
the
usual
farce
of
with
the
distress
that
was
certain
to
ensue
the
rev
mr
bosher
talked
of
reopening
the
labour
yard
the
secretary
of
the
obs
appealed
for
more
money
and
clothing
and
boots
the
funds
of
the
society
had
been
depleted
by
the
payment
of
his
quarter
salary
there
were
rumours
that
the
soup
kitchen
would
be
reopened
at
an
early
date
for
the
sale
of
and
charitable
persons
began
to
talk
of
rummage
sales
and
soup
tickets
now
and
then
whenever
a
in
a
few
of
rushton
men
were
able
to
put
in
a
few
hours
work
but
barrington
never
went
back
his
manner
of
life
was
the
subject
of
much
speculation
on
the
part
of
his
former
workmates
who
were
not
a
little
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
he
was
much
better
dressed
than
they
had
ever
known
him
to
be
before
and
that
he
was
never
without
money
he
generally
had
a
tanner
or
a
bob
to
lend
and
was
always
ready
to
stand
a
drink
to
say
nothing
of
what
it
must
have
cost
him
for
the
quantities
of
socialist
pamphlets
and
leaflets
that
he
gave
away
broadcast
he
lodged
over
at
windley
but
he
used
to
take
his
meals
at
a
little
coffee
tavern
down
town
where
he
used
often
to
invite
one
or
two
of
his
old
mates
to
take
dinner
with
him
it
sometimes
happened
that
one
of
them
would
invite
him
home
of
an
evening
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
or
to
see
some
curiosity
that
the
other
thought
would
interest
him
and
on
these
occasions
if
there
were
any
children
in
the
house
to
which
they
were
going
barrington
usually
made
a
point
of
going
into
a
shop
on
their
way
and
buying
a
bag
of
cakes
or
fruit
for
them
all
sorts
of
theories
were
put
forward
to
account
for
his
apparent
affluence
some
said
he
was
a
toff
in
disguise
others
that
he
had
rich
relations
who
were
ashamed
of
him
because
he
was
a
socialist
and
who
allowed
him
so
much
a
week
so
long
as
he
kept
away
from
them
and
did
not
use
his
real
name
some
of
the
liberals
said
that
he
was
in
the
pay
of
the
tories
who
were
seeking
by
underhand
methods
to
split
up
the
progressive
liberal
party
just
about
that
time
several
burglaries
took
place
in
the
town
the
thieves
getting
clear
away
with
the
plunder
and
this
circumstance
led
to
a
dark
rumour
that
barrington
was
the
culprit
and
that
it
was
these
gains
that
he
was
spending
so
freely
about
the
middle
of
october
an
event
happened
that
drew
the
town
into
a
state
of
wild
excitement
and
such
comparatively
unimportant
subjects
as
unemployment
and
starvation
were
almost
forgotten
sir
graball
had
been
promoted
to
yet
a
higher
post
in
the
service
of
the
country
that
he
owned
such
a
large
part
of
he
was
not
only
to
have
a
higher
and
more
honourable
position
but
also
as
was
nothing
but
right
a
higher
salary
his
pay
was
to
be
increased
to
seven
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
week
and
in
consequence
of
this
promotion
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
resign
his
seat
and
seek
the
tory
workmen
as
they
loitered
about
the
streets
their
stomachs
empty
said
to
each
other
that
it
was
a
great
honour
for
mugsborough
that
their
member
should
be
promoted
in
this
way
they
boasted
about
it
and
assumed
as
much
swagger
in
their
gait
as
their
broken
boots
permitted
they
stuck
election
cards
bearing
sir
graball
photograph
in
their
windows
and
tied
bits
of
blue
and
yellow
ribbon
sir
colours
on
their
underfed
children
the
liberals
were
furious
they
said
that
an
election
had
been
sprung
on
them
they
had
been
taken
a
mean
advantage
of
they
had
no
candidate
ready
they
had
no
complaint
to
make
about
the
salary
all
they
complained
of
was
the
short
notice
it
was
fair
because
while
they
the
leading
liberals
had
been
treating
the
electors
with
the
contemptuous
indifference
that
is
customary
sir
graball
had
been
most
active
amongst
his
constituents
for
months
past
cunningly
preparing
for
the
contest
he
had
really
been
electioneering
for
the
past
six
months
last
winter
he
had
kicked
off
at
quite
a
number
of
football
matches
besides
doing
all
sorts
of
things
for
the
local
teams
he
had
joined
the
buffalos
and
the
druids
been
elected
president
of
the
skull
and
crossbones
boys
society
and
although
he
was
not
himself
an
abstainer
he
was
so
friendly
to
temperance
that
he
had
on
several
occasions
taken
the
chair
at
teetotal
meetings
to
say
nothing
of
the
teas
to
the
poor
school
children
and
things
of
that
sort
in
short
he
had
been
quite
an
active
politician
in
the
tory
sense
of
the
word
for
months
past
and
the
poor
liberals
had
not
smelt
a
rat
until
the
election
was
sprung
upon
them
a
hurried
meeting
of
the
liberal
three
hundred
was
held
and
a
deputation
sent
to
london
to
find
a
candidate
but
as
there
was
only
a
week
before
polling
day
they
were
unsuccessful
in
their
mission
another
meeting
was
held
presided
over
by
mr
adam
sweater
rushton
and
didlum
also
being
present
profound
dejection
was
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
those
assembled
as
they
listened
to
the
delegates
report
the
sombre
silence
that
followed
was
broken
at
length
by
mr
rushton
who
suddenly
started
up
and
said
that
he
began
to
think
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
going
outside
the
constituency
at
all
to
look
for
a
man
it
was
strange
but
true
that
a
prophet
never
received
honour
in
his
own
land
they
had
been
wasting
the
precious
time
running
about
all
over
the
country
begging
and
praying
for
a
candidate
and
overlooking
the
fact
that
they
had
in
their
midst
a
gentleman
a
fellow
townsman
who
he
believed
would
have
a
better
chance
of
success
than
any
stranger
surely
they
would
all
agree
if
they
could
only
prevail
upon
him
to
stand
that
adam
sweater
would
be
an
ideal
liberal
candidate
while
mr
rushton
was
speaking
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
three
hundred
were
reviving
and
at
the
name
of
sweater
they
all
began
to
clap
their
hands
and
stamp
their
feet
loud
shouts
of
enthusiastic
approval
burst
forth
and
cries
of
old
sweater
resounded
through
the
room
when
sweater
rose
to
reply
the
tumult
died
away
as
suddenly
as
it
had
commenced
he
thanked
them
for
the
honour
they
were
conferring
upon
him
there
was
no
time
to
waste
in
words
or
idle
compliments
rather
than
allow
the
enemy
to
have
a
he
would
accede
to
their
request
and
contest
the
seat
a
roar
of
applause
burst
from
the
throats
of
the
delighted
three
hundred
outside
the
hall
in
which
the
meeting
was
being
held
a
large
crowd
of
liberal
working
men
many
of
them
wearing
broken
boots
and
other
men
clothing
was
waiting
to
hear
the
report
of
the
deputation
and
as
soon
as
sweater
had
consented
to
be
nominated
didlum
rushed
and
opened
the
window
overlooking
the
street
and
shouted
the
good
news
down
to
the
crowd
which
joined
in
the
cheering
in
response
to
their
demands
for
a
speech
sweater
brought
his
obese
carcass
to
the
window
and
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
reminding
them
of
the
shortness
of
the
time
at
their
disposal
and
intreating
them
to
work
hard
in
order
that
the
grand
old
flag
might
be
carried
to
victory
at
such
times
these
people
forgot
all
about
unemployment
and
starvation
and
became
enthusiastic
about
old
flags
their
devotion
to
this
flag
was
so
great
that
so
long
as
they
were
able
to
carry
it
to
victory
they
did
not
mind
being
poverty
stricken
and
hungry
and
ragged
all
that
mattered
was
to
score
off
their
hated
their
fellow
countrymen
the
tories
and
carry
the
grand
old
flag
to
victory
the
fact
that
they
had
carried
the
flag
to
victory
so
often
in
the
past
without
obtaining
any
of
the
spoils
did
not
seem
to
damp
their
ardour
in
the
least
being
philanthropists
they
were
content
after
winning
the
victory
that
their
masters
should
always
do
the
looting
at
the
conclusion
of
sweater
remarks
the
philanthropists
gave
three
frantic
cheers
and
then
someone
in
the
crowd
shouted
the
colour
after
a
hasty
consultation
with
rushton
who
being
a
decorator
was
thought
to
be
an
authority
on
colours
green
grass
green
was
decided
upon
and
the
information
was
shouted
down
to
the
crowd
who
cheered
again
then
a
rush
was
made
to
sweater
emporium
and
several
yards
of
cheap
green
ribbon
were
bought
and
divided
up
into
little
pieces
which
they
tied
into
their
buttonholes
and
thus
appropriately
decorated
formed
themselves
into
military
order
four
deep
and
marched
through
all
the
principal
streets
up
and
down
the
grand
parade
round
and
round
the
fountain
and
finally
over
the
hill
to
windley
singing
to
the
tune
of
tramp

adam

is
our
man
and
we
have
him
if
we
can
then
we
always
have
the
biggest
loaf
for

the
spectacle
presented
by
these
men
some
of
them
with
grey
heads
and
beards
as
they
marked
time
or
tramped
along
singing
this
childish
twaddle
would
have
been
amusing
if
it
had
not
been
disgusting
by
way
of
variety
they
sang
several
other
things
including
hang
ole
closeland
on
a
sour
apple
tree
and
rally
men
of
windley
for

sure
to
win
as
they
passed
the
big
church
in
quality
street
the
clock
began
to
strike
it
was
one
of
those
that
strike
four
chimes
at
each
quarter
of
the
hour
it
was
now
ten
so
there
were
sixteen
musical
chimes
ding

they
all
chanted
in

with
the
striking

in
the
same
way
the
tories
would
chant
all
close

grab
all
close
land
grab
all
close
land
grab
all

the
town
was
soon
deluged
with
mendacious
literature
and
smothered
with
huge
posters
for
adam
sweater
the
friend
for
sweater
and
temperance
reform
for
sweater
free
trade
and
cheap
food
or
for
tariff
reform
and
plenty
of
work
this
beautiful
idea
of
work
appealed
strongly
to
the
tory
workmen
they
seemed
to
regard
themselves
and
their
children
as
a
sort
of
machines
or
beasts
of
burden
created
for
the
purpose
of
working
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
they
did
not
think
it
right
that
they
should
live
and
enjoy
the
benefits
of
civilization
all
they
desired
for
themselves
and
their
children
was
of
work
they
marched
about
the
streets
singing
their
marseillaise
boys
work
and
be
contented
to
the
tune
of
tramp
tramp
the
boys
are
marching
and
at
intervals
as
they
tramped
along
they
gave
three
cheers
for
sir
graball
tariff
reform
and
plenty
of
work
both
sides
imported
gangs
of
hired
orators
who
held
forth
every
night
at
the
corners
of
the
principal
streets
and
on
the
open
spaces
from
portable
platforms
and
from
motor
cars
and
lorries
the
tories
said
that
the
liberal
party
in
the
house
of
commons
was
composed
principally
of
scoundrels
and
fools
the
liberals
said
that
the
tory
party
were
fools
and
scoundrels
a
host
of
richly
dressed
canvassers
descended
upon
windley
in
carriages
and
motor
cars
and
begged
for
votes
from
the
working
men
who
lived
there
one
evening
a
liberal
demonstration
was
held
at
the
cross
roads
on
windley
hill
notwithstanding
the
cold
weather
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
shabbily
dressed
people
many
of
whom
had
not
had
a
really
good
meal
for
months
it
was
a
clear
night
the
moon
was
at
the
full
and
the
scene
was
further
illuminated
by
the
fitful
glare
of
several
torches
stuck
on
the
end
of
poles
the
platform
was
a
large
lorry
and
there
were
several
speakers
including
adam
sweater
himself
and
a
real
live
liberal
peer
lord
ammenegg
this
individual
had
made
a
considerable
fortune
in
the
grocery
and
provision
line
and
had
been
elevated
to
the
peerage
by
the
last
liberal
government
on
account
of
his
services
to
the
party
and
in
consideration
of
other
considerations
both
sweater
and
ammenegg
were
to
speak
at
two
other
meetings
that
night
and
were
not
expected
at
windley
until
about
so
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
till
they
arrived
several
other
gentlemen
including
rushton
who
presided
and
didlum
and
one
of
the
five
pounds
a
week
orators
addressed
the
meeting
mingled
with
the
crowd
were
about
twenty
men
strangers
to
the
town
who
wore
huge
green
rosettes
and
loudly
applauded
the
speakers
they
also
distributed
sweater
literature
and
cards
with
lists
of
the
different
meetings
that
were
to
be
held
during
the
election
these
men
were
bullies
hired
by
sweater
agent
they
came
from
the
neighbourhood
of
seven
dials
in
london
and
were
paid
ten
shillings
a
day
one
of
their
duties
was
to
incite
the
crowd
to
bash
anyone
who
disturbed
the
meetings
or
tried
to
put
awkward
questions
to
the
speakers
the
hired
orator
was
a
tall
slight
man
with
dark
hair
beard
and
moustache
he
might
have
been
called
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
ugly
scar
upon
his
forehead
which
gave
him
a
rather
sinister
appearance
he
was
an
effective
speaker
the
audience
punctuated
his
speech
with
cheers
and
when
he
wound
up
with
an
earnest
appeal
to
them
as
working
men
to
vote
for
adam
sweater
their
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
seen
him
somewhere
before
remarked
barrington
who
was
standing
in
the
crowd
with
harlow
owen
and
easton
have
i
said
owen
with
a
puzzled
expression
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
remember
where
harlow
and
easton
also
thought
they
had
seen
the
man
before
but
their
speculations
were
put
an
end
to
by
the
roar
of
cheering
that
heralded
the
arrival
of
the
motor
car
containing
adam
sweater
and
his
friend
lord
ammenegg
unfortunately
those
who
had
arranged
the
meeting
had
forgotten
to
provide
a
pair
of
steps
so
sweater
found
it
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
to
mount
the
platform
however
while
his
friends
were
hoisting
and
pushing
him
up
the
meeting
beguiled
the
time
by
singing
vote
vote
for
adam
sweater
after
a
terrible
struggle
they
succeeded
in
getting
him
on
to
the
cart
and
while
he
was
recovering
his
wind
rushton
made
a
few
remarks
to
the
crowd
sweater
then
advanced
to
the
front
but
in
consequence
of
the
cheering
and
singing
he
was
unable
to
make
himself
heard
for
several
minutes
when
at
length
he
was
able
to
proceed
ho
made
a
very
clever
speech
it
had
been
specially
written
for
him
and
had
cost
ten
guineas
a
large
part
of
it
consisted
of
warnings
against
the
dangers
of
socialism
sweater
had
carefully
rehearsed
this
speech
and
he
delivered
it
very
effectively
some
of
those
socialists
he
said
were
but
mistaken
people
who
did
not
realize
the
harm
that
would
result
if
their
extraordinary
ideas
were
ever
put
into
practice
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
stage
whisper
as
he
asked
is
this
socialism
that
we
hear
so
much
about
but
which
so
few
understand
what
is
it
and
what
does
it
mean
then
raising
his
voice
till
it
rang
through
the
air
and
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
assembled
multitude
like
the
clanging
of
a
funeral
bell
he
continued
is
madness
chaos
anarchy
it
means
ruin
black
ruin
for
the
rich
and
consequently
of
course
blacker
ruin
still
for
the
poor
as
sweater
paused
a
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
the
meeting
men
wearing
broken
boots
and
with
patches
upon
the
seats
and
knees
and
ragged
fringes
round
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
of
their
trousers
grew
pale
and
glanced
apprehensively
at
each
other
if
ever
socialism
did
come
to
pass
they
evidently
thought
it
very
probable
that
they
would
have
to
walk
about
in
a
sort
of
prehistoric
highland
costume
without
any
trousers
or
boots
at
all
women
most
of
them
dressed
in
other
women
shabby
clothing
weary
mothers
who
fed
their
children
for
the
most
part
on
adulterated
tea
tinned
skimmed
milk
and
bread
and
margarine
grew
furious
as
they
thought
of
the
wicked
socialists
who
were
trying
to
bring
ruin
upon
them
it
never
occurred
to
any
of
these
poor
people
that
they
were
in
a
condition
of
ruin
black
ruin
already
but
if
sweater
had
suddenly
found
himself
reduced
to
the
same
social
condition
as
the
majority
of
those
he
addressed
there
is
not
much
doubt
that
he
would
have
thought
that
he
was
in
a
condition
of
black
ruin
the
awful
silence
that
had
fallen
on
the
crowd
was
presently
broken
by
a
philanthropist
who
shouted
out
knows
wot
they
are
sir
most
of
is
chaps
wot
got
tired
of
workin
for
their
livin
so
they
wants
us
to
keep
encouraged
by
numerous
expressions
of
approval
from
the
other
philanthropists
the
man
continued
we
ai
such
fools
as
they
thinks
and
so
they
find
out
next
monday
most
of
wants
and
i
would
mind
lendin
a
with
the
rope
myself
applause
and
laughter
greeted
these
noble
sentiments
and
sweater
resumed
his
address
when
another
man
evidently
a
socialist
for
he
was
accompanied
by
three
or
four
others
who
like
himself
wore
red
ties
interrupted
and
said
that
he
would
like
to
ask
him
a
question
no
notice
was
taken
of
this
request
either
by
mr
sweater
or
the
chairman
but
a
few
angry
cries
of
came
from
the
crowd
sweater
continued
but
the
man
again
interrupted
and
the
cries
of
the
crowd
became
more
threatening
rushton
started
up
and
said
that
he
could
not
allow
the
speaker
to
be
interrupted
but
if
the
gentleman
would
wait
till
the
end
of
the
meeting
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
asking
his
question
then
the
man
said
he
would
wait
as
desired
sweater
resumed
his
oration
and
presently
the
interrupter
and
his
friends
found
themselves
surrounded
by
the
gang
of
hired
bullies
who
wore
the
big
rosettes
and
who
glared
menacingly
at
them
sweater
concluded
his
speech
with
an
appeal
to
the
crowd
to
deal
a
bow
at
the
enemy
next
monday
and
then
amid
a
storm
of
applause
lord
ammenegg
stepped
to
the
front
he
said
that
he
did
not
intend
to
inflict
a
long
speech
upon
them
that
evening
and
as
it
was
nomination
day
tomorrow
he
would
not
be
able
to
have
the
honour
of
addressing
them
again
during
the
election
but
even
if
he
had
wished
to
make
a
long
speech
it
would
be
very
difficult
after
the
brilliant
and
eloquent
address
they
had
just
listened
to
from
mr
sweater
for
it
seemed
to
him
ammenegg
that
adam
sweater
had
left
nothing
for
anyone
else
to
say
but
he
would
like
to
tell
them
of
a
thought
that
had
occurred
to
him
that
evening
they
read
in
the
bible
that
the
wise
men
came
from
the
east
windley
as
they
all
knew
was
the
east
end
of
the
town
they
were
the
men
of
the
east
and
he
was
sure
that
next
monday
they
would
prove
that
they
were
the
wise
men
of
the
east
by
voting
for
adam
sweater
and
putting
him
at
the
top
of
the
poll
with
a
majority
the
wise
men
of
the
east
greeted
ammenegg
remarks
with
prolonged
imbecile
cheers
and
amid
the
tumult
his
lordship
and
sweater
got
into
the
motor
car
and
cleared
off
without
giving
the
man
with
the
red
tie
or
anyone
else
who
desired
to
ask
questions
any
opportunity
of
doing
so
rushton
and
the
other
leaders
got
into
another
motor
car
and
followed
the
first
to
take
part
in
another
meeting
which
was
to
be
addressed
by
the
great
sir
featherstone
blood
the
crowd
now
resolved
itself
into
military
order
headed
by
the
men
with
torches
and
a
large
white
banner
on
which
was
written
in
huge
black
letters
man
is
adam
sweater
they
marched
down
the
hill
singing
and
when
they
reached
the
fountain
on
the
grand
parade
they
saw
another
crowd
holding
a
meeting
there
these
were
tories
and
they
became
so
infuriated
at
the
sound
of
the
liberal
songs
and
by
the
sight
of
the
banner
that
they
abandoned
their
meeting
and
charged
the
processionists
a
free
fight
ensued
both
sides
fought
like
savages
but
as
the
liberals
were
outnumbered
by
about
three
to
one
they
were
driven
off
the
field
with
great
slaughter
most
of
the
torch
poles
were
taken
from
them
and
the
banner
was
torn
to
ribbons
then
the
tories
went
back
to
the
fountain
carrying
the
captured
torches
and
singing
to
the
tune
of
anyone
seen
a
german
band
anyone
seen
a
flag
flag
flag
while
the
tories
resumed
their
meeting
at
the
fountain
the
liberals
rallied
in
one
of
the
back
streets
messengers
were
sent
in
various
directions
for
reinforcements
and
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
they
emerged
from
their
retreat
and
swooped
down
upon
the
tory
meeting
they
overturned
the
platform
recaptured
their
torches
tore
the
banner
to
tatters
and
drove
them
from
their
position
then
the
liberals
in
their
turn
paraded
the
streets
singing
anyone
seen
a
tory
flag
and
proceeded
to
the
hall
where
sir
featherstone
was
speaking
arriving
as
the
audience
left
the
crowd
that
came
pouring
out
of
the
hall
was
worked
up
to
a
frenzy
of
enthusiasm
for
the
speech
they
had
just
listened
to
had
been
a
sort
of
manifesto
to
the
country
in
response
to
the
cheering
of
the
processionists
who
of
course
had
not
heard
the
speech
but
were
cheering
from
force
of
habit
sir
featherstone
blood
stood
up
in
the
carriage
and
addressed
the
crowd
briefly
outlining
the
great
measures
of
social
reform
that
his
party
proposed
to
enact
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
working
classes
and
as
they
listened
the
wise
men
grew
delirious
with
enthusiasm
he
referred
to
land
taxes
and
death
duties
which
would
provide
money
to
build
battleships
to
protect
the
property
of
the
rich
and
provide
work
for
the
poor
another
tax
was
to
provide
a
nice
smooth
road
for
the
rich
to
ride
upon
in
motor
cars
and
to
provide
work
for
the
poor
another
tax
would
be
used
for
development
which
would
also
make
work
for
the
poor
and
so
on
a
great
point
was
made
of
the
fact
that
the
rich
were
actually
to
be
made
to
pay
something
towards
the
cost
of
their
road
themselves
but
nothing
was
said
about
how
they
would
get
the
money
to
do
it
no
reference
was
made
to
how
the
workers
would
be
sweated
and
driven
and
starved
to
earn
dividends
and
rent
and
interest
and
profits
to
put
into
the
pockets
of
the
rich
before
the
latter
would
be
able
to
pay
for
anything
at
all
these
are
the
things
gentlemen
that
we
propose
to
do
for
you
and
at
the
rate
of
progress
which
we
propose
to
adopt
i
say
without
fear
or
contradiction
that
within
the
next
five
hundred
years
we
shall
so
reform
social
conditions
in
this
country
that
the
working
classes
will
be
able
to
enjoy
some
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
only
question
before
you
is
are
you
willing
to
wait
for
five
hundred
years
sir
shouted
the
wise
men
with
enthusiasm
at
the
glorious
prospect
sir
we
wait
a
thousand
years
if
you
like
sir
been
waiting
all
my
life
said
one
poor
old
veteran
who
had
assisted
to
the
old
flag
to
victory
times
out
of
number
in
the
past
and
who
for
his
share
of
the
spoils
of
those
victories
was
now
in
a
condition
of
abject
miserable
poverty
with
the
portals
of
the
workhouse
yawning
open
to
receive
him
waited
all
my
life
hoping
and
trusting
for
better
conditions
so
a
few
more
years
wo
make
much
difference
to
me
you
trouble
to
yourself
sir
shouted
another
solomon
in
the
crowd
do
mind
waiting
take
your
own
time
sir
you
know
better
than
the
likes
of
us
long
it
ought
to
take
in
conclusion
the
great
man
warned
them
against
being
led
away
by
the
socialists
those
foolish
unreasonable
impractical
people
who
wanted
to
see
an
immediate
improvement
in
their
condition
and
he
reminded
them
that
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
the
wise
men
applauded
lustily
it
did
not
appear
to
occur
to
any
of
them
that
the
rate
at
which
the
ancient
roman
conducted
their
building
operations
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
case
sir
featherstone
blood
sat
down
amid
a
wild
storm
of
cheering
and
then
the
procession
reformed
and
reinforced
by
the
audience
from
the
hall
they
proceeded
to
march
about
the
dreary
streets
singing
to
the
tune
of
the
of
harlech
for
sweater
vote
for
sweater
vote
for
sweater
vote
for
sweater
the
man
who
has
a
plan
to
liberate
and
reinstate
the
workers
of
show
your
mettle
let
them
see
that
you
in
fettle
once
for
all
this
question
settle
sweater
shall
prevail
the
carriage
containing
sir
featherstone
adam
sweater
and
rushton
and
didlum
was
in
the
middle
of
the
procession
the
banner
and
the
torches
were
at
the
head
and
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
was
heightened
by
four
men
who
walked
two
on
each
side
of
the
carriage
burning
green
fire
in
frying
pans
as
they
passed
by
the
slave
market
a
poor
shabbily
dressed
wretch
whose
boots
were
so
worn
and
rotten
that
they
were
almost
falling
off
his
feet
climbed
up
a
and
taking
off
his
cap
waved
it
in
the
air
and
shrieked
out
cheers
for
sir
featherstone
blood
our
future
prime
minister
the
philanthropists
cheered
themselves
hoarse
and
finally
took
the
horses
out
of
the
traces
and
harnessed
themselves
to
the
carriage
instead
much
wages
will
sir
featherstone
get
if
is
made
prime
minister
asked
harlow
of
another
philanthropist
who
was
also
pushing
up
behind
the
carriage
thousand
a
year
replied
the
other
who
by
some
strange
chance
happened
to
know
comes
to
a
pounds
a
week
enough
too
for
a
man
like
said
harlow
right
mate
said
the
other
with
deep
sympathy
in
his
voice
time
office
was
only
in
for
five
years
so
only
made
thousand
pounds
out
of
it
of
course
got
a
pension
as
well
two
thousand
a
year
for
life
i
think
it
is
but
after
all
what
that
for
a
man
like
replied
harlow
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
and
newman
who
was
also
there
helping
to
drag
the
carriage
said
that
it
ought
to
be
at
least
double
that
amount
however
they
found
some
consolation
in
knowing
that
sir
featherstone
would
not
have
to
wait
till
he
was
seventy
before
he
obtained
his
pension
he
would
get
it
directly
he
came
out
of
office
the
following
evening
barrington
owen
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
who
had
subscribed
enough
money
between
them
to
purchase
a
lot
of
socialist
leaflets
employed
themselves
distributing
them
to
the
crowds
at
the
liberal
and
tory
meetings
and
whilst
they
were
doing
this
they
frequently
became
involved
in
arguments
with
the
supporters
of
the
capitalist
system
in
their
attempts
to
persuade
others
to
refrain
from
voting
for
either
of
the
candidates
they
were
opposed
even
by
some
who
professed
to
believe
in
socialism
who
said
that
as
there
was
no
better
socialist
candidate
the
thing
to
do
was
to
vote
for
the
better
of
the
two
this
was
the
view
of
harlow
and
easton
whom
they
met
harlow
had
a
green
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
but
easton
wore
colours
one
man
said
that
if
he
had
his
way
all
those
who
had
votes
should
be
compelled
to
record
them
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
or
be
disenfranchised
barrington
asked
him
if
he
believed
in
tarrif
reform
the
man
said
no
not
demanded
barrington
the
other
replied
that
he
opposed
tariff
reform
because
he
believed
it
would
ruin
the
country
barrington
inquired
if
he
were
a
supporter
of
socialism
the
man
said
he
was
not
and
when
further
questioned
he
said
that
he
believed
if
it
were
ever
adopted
it
would
bring
black
ruin
upon
the
country
he
believed
this
because
mr
sweater
had
said
so
when
barrington
asked
him
supposing
there
were
only
two
candidates
one
a
socialist
and
the
other
a
tariff
reformer
how
would
he
like
to
be
compelled
to
vote
for
one
of
them
he
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
during
the
next
few
days
the
contest
continued
the
hired
orators
continued
to
pour
forth
their
streams
of
eloquence
and
tons
of
literature
flooded
the
town
the
walls
were
covered
with
huge
posters
liberal
lie
tory
fraud
unconsciously
each
of
these
two
parties
put
in
some
splendid
work
for
socialism
in
so
much
that
each
of
them
thoroughly
exposed
the
hypocrisy
of
the
other
if
the
people
had
only
had
the
sense
they
might
have
seen
that
the
quarrel
between
the
liberal
and
tory
leaders
was
merely
a
quarrel
between
thieves
over
the
spoil
but
unfortunately
most
of
the
people
had
not
the
sense
to
perceive
this
they
were
blinded
by
bigoted
devotion
to
their
parties
and
inflamed
with
maniacal
enthusiasm
thought
of
nothing
but
their
flags
to
victory
at
considerable
danger
to
themselves
barrington
owen
and
the
other
socialists
continued
to
distribute
their
leaflets
and
to
heckle
the
liberal
and
tory
speakers
they
asked
the
tories
to
explain
the
prevalence
of
unemployment
and
poverty
in
protected
countries
like
germany
and
america
and
at
sweater
meetings
they
requested
to
be
informed
what
was
the
liberal
remedy
for
unemployment
from
both
parties
the
socialists
obtained
the
same
kinds
of
answer
threats
of
violence
and
requests
to
disturb
the
meeting
these
socialists
held
quite
a
lot
of
informal
meetings
on
their
own
every
now
and
then
when
they
were
giving
their
leaflets
away
some
unwary
supporter
of
the
capitalist
system
would
start
an
argument
and
soon
a
crowd
would
gather
round
and
listen
sometimes
the
socialists
succeeded
in
arguing
their
opponents
to
an
absolute
standstill
for
the
liberals
and
tones
found
it
impossible
to
deny
that
machinery
is
the
cause
of
the
overcrowded
state
of
the
labour
market
that
the
overcrowded
labour
market
is
the
cause
of
unemployment
that
the
fact
of
there
being
always
an
army
of
unemployed
waiting
to
take
other
men
jobs
away
from
them
destroys
the
independence
of
those
who
are
in
employment
and
keeps
them
in
subjection
to
their
masters
they
found
it
impossible
to
deny
that
this
machinery
is
being
used
not
for
the
benefit
of
all
but
to
make
fortunes
for
a
few
in
short
they
were
unable
to
disprove
that
the
monopoly
of
the
land
and
machinery
by
a
comparatively
few
persons
is
the
cause
of
the
poverty
of
the
majority
but
when
these
arguments
that
they
were
unable
to
answer
were
put
before
them
and
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
only
possible
remedy
was
the
public
ownership
and
management
of
the
means
of
production
they
remained
angrily
silent
having
no
alternative
plan
to
suggest
at
other
times
the
meeting
resolved
itself
into
a
number
of
quarrelsome
disputes
between
the
liberals
and
tories
that
formed
the
crowd
which
split
itself
up
into
a
lot
of
little
groups
and
whatever
the
original
subject
might
have
been
they
soon
drifted
to
a
hundred
other
things
for
most
of
the
supporters
of
the
present
system
seemed
incapable
of
pursuing
any
one
subject
to
its
logical
conclusion
a
discussion
would
be
started
about
something
or
other
presently
an
unimportant
side
issue
would
crop
up
then
the
original
subject
would
be
left
unfinished
and
they
would
argue
and
shout
about
the
side
issue
in
a
little
while
another
side
issue
would
arise
and
then
the
first
side
issue
would
be
abandoned
also
unfinished
and
an
angry
wrangle
about
the
second
issue
would
ensue
the
original
subject
being
altogether
forgotten
they
did
not
seem
to
really
desire
to
discover
the
truth
or
to
find
out
the
best
way
to
bring
about
an
improvement
in
their
condition
their
only
object
seemed
to
be
to
score
off
their
opponents
usually
after
one
of
these
arguments
owen
would
wander
off
by
himself
with
his
head
throbbing
and
a
feeling
of
unutterable
depression
and
misery
at
his
heart
weighed
down
by
a
growing
conviction
of
the
hopelessness
of
everything
of
the
folly
of
expecting
that
his
fellow
workmen
would
ever
be
willing
to
try
to
understand
for
themselves
the
causes
that
produced
their
sufferings
it
was
not
that
those
causes
were
so
obscure
that
it
required
exceptional
intelligence
to
perceive
them
the
causes
of
all
the
misery
were
so
apparent
that
a
little
child
could
easily
be
made
to
understand
both
the
disease
and
the
remedy
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
had
become
so
convinced
of
their
own
intellectual
inferiority
that
they
did
not
dare
to
rely
on
their
own
intelligence
to
guide
them
preferring
to
resign
the
management
of
their
affairs
unreservedly
into
the
hands
of
those
who
battened
upon
and
robbed
them
they
did
not
know
the
causes
of
the
poverty
that
perpetually
held
them
and
their
children
in
its
cruel
grip
and
they
did
not
want
to
know
and
if
one
explained
those
causes
to
them
in
such
language
and
in
such
a
manner
that
they
were
almost
compelled
to
understand
and
afterwards
pointed
out
to
them
the
obvious
remedy
they
were
neither
glad
nor
responsive
but
remained
silent
and
were
angry
because
they
found
themselves
unable
to
answer
and
disprove
they
remained
silent
afraid
to
trust
their
own
intelligence
and
the
reason
of
this
attitude
was
that
they
had
to
choose
between
the
evidence
and
their
own
intelligence
and
the
stories
told
them
by
their
masters
and
exploiters
and
when
it
came
to
making
this
choice
they
deemed
it
safer
to
follow
their
old
guides
than
to
rely
on
their
own
judgement
because
from
their
very
infancy
they
had
had
drilled
into
them
the
doctrine
of
their
own
mental
and
social
inferiority
and
their
conviction
of
the
truth
of
this
doctrine
was
voiced
in
the
degraded
expression
that
fell
so
frequently
from
their
lips
when
speaking
of
themselves
and
each
other
likes
of
us
they
did
not
know
the
causes
of
their
poverty
they
did
not
want
to
know
they
did
not
want
to
hear
all
they
desired
was
to
be
left
alone
so
that
they
might
continue
to
worship
and
follow
those
who
took
advantage
of
their
simplicity
and
robbed
them
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
their
old
leaders
the
fools
or
scoundrels
who
fed
them
with
words
who
had
led
them
into
the
desolation
where
they
now
seemed
to
be
content
to
grind
out
treasure
for
their
masters
and
to
starve
when
those
masters
did
not
find
it
profitable
to
employ
them
it
was
as
if
a
flock
of
foolish
sheep
placed
themselves
under
the
protection
of
a
pack
of
ravening
wolves
several
times
the
small
band
of
socialists
narrowly
escaped
being
mobbed
but
they
succeeded
in
disposing
of
most
of
their
leaflets
without
any
serious
trouble
towards
the
latter
part
of
one
evening
barrington
and
owen
became
separated
from
the
others
and
shortly
afterwards
these
two
lost
each
other
in
the
crush
about
nine
barrington
was
in
a
large
liberal
crowd
listening
to
the
same
hired
orator
who
had
spoken
a
few
evenings
before
on
the
hill
the
man
with
the
scar
on
his
forehead
the
crowd
was
applauding
him
loudly
and
barrington
again
fell
to
wondering
where
he
had
seen
this
man
before
as
on
the
previous
occasion
this
speaker
made
no
reference
to
socialism
confining
himself
to
other
matters
barrington
examined
him
closely
trying
to
recall
under
what
circumstances
they
had
met
previously
and
presently
he
remembered
that
this
was
one
of
the
socialists
who
had
come
with
the
band
of
cyclists
into
the
town
that
sunday
morning
away
back
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
the
man
who
had
come
afterwards
with
the
van
and
who
had
been
struck
down
by
a
stone
while
attempting
to
speak
from
the
platform
of
the
van
the
man
who
had
been
nearly
killed
by
the
upholders
of
the
capitalist
system
it
was
the
same
man
the
socialist
had
been
this
man
wore
beard
and
moustache
but
barrington
was
certain
he
was
the
same
when
the
man
had
concluded
his
speech
he
got
down
and
stood
in
the
shade
behind
the
platform
while
someone
else
addressed
the
meeting
and
barrington
went
round
to
where
he
was
standing
intending
to
speak
to
him
all
around
them
pandemonium
reigned
supreme
they
were
in
the
vicinity
of
the
slave
market
near
the
fountain
on
the
grand
parade
where
several
roads
met
there
was
a
meeting
going
on
at
every
corner
and
a
number
of
others
in
different
parts
of
the
roadway
and
on
the
pavement
of
the
parade
some
of
these
meetings
were
being
carried
on
by
two
or
three
men
who
spoke
in
turn
from
small
portable
platforms
they
carried
with
them
and
placed
wherever
they
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
an
audience
every
now
and
then
some
of
these
poor
wretches
they
were
all
paid
speakers
were
surrounded
and
savagely
mauled
and
beaten
by
a
hostile
crowd
if
they
were
tariff
reformers
the
liberals
mobbed
them
and
vice
versa
lines
of
rowdies
swaggered
to
and
fro
arm
in
arm
singing
vote
vote
for
good
ole
closeland
or
ole
sweater
according
as
they
were
green
or
blue
and
yellow
gangs
of
hooligans
paraded
up
and
down
armed
with
sticks
singing
howling
cursing
and
looking
for
someone
to
hit
others
stood
in
groups
on
the
pavement
with
their
hands
thrust
in
their
pockets
or
leaned
against
walls
or
the
shutters
of
the
shops
with
expressions
of
ecstatic
imbecility
on
their
faces
chanting
the
mournful
dirge
to
the
tune
of
the
church
chimes
ole
sweat
er
good
ole
sweat
er
good
ole
sweat
er
good
ole
sweat
er
other
groups
to
the
same
tune
sang
ole
close
land
and
every
now
and
again
they
used
to
leave
off
singing
and
begin
to
beat
each
other
fights
used
to
take
place
often
between
workmen
about
the
respective
merits
of
adam
sweater
and
sir
graball
the
walls
were
covered
with
huge
liberal
and
tory
posters
which
showed
in
every
line
the
contempt
of
those
who
published
them
for
the
intelligence
of
the
working
men
to
whom
they
were
addressed
there
was
one
tory
poster
that
represented
the
interior
of
a
public
house
in
front
of
the
bar
with
a
quart
pot
in
his
hand
a
clay
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
load
of
tools
on
his
back
stood
a
brute
who
represented
the
tory
ideal
of
what
an
englishman
should
be
the
letterpress
on
the
poster
said
it
was
a
man
this
is
the
ideal
of
manhood
that
they
hold
up
to
the
majority
of
their
fellow
countrymen
but
privately
amongst
themselves
the
tory
aristocrats
regard
such
with
far
less
respect
than
they
do
the
lower
animals
horses
or
dogs
for
instance
the
liberal
posters
were
not
quite
so
offensive
they
were
more
cunning
more
specious
more
hypocritical
and
consequently
more
calculated
to
mislead
and
deceive
the
more
intelligent
of
the
voters
when
barrington
got
round
to
the
back
of
the
platform
he
found
the
man
with
the
scarred
face
standing
alone
and
gloomily
silent
in
the
shadow
barrington
gave
him
one
of
the
socialist
leaflets
which
he
took
and
after
glancing
at
it
put
it
in
his
coat
pocket
without
making
any
remark
hope
you
excuse
me
for
asking
but
were
you
not
formerly
a
socialist
said
barrington
even
in
the
barrington
saw
the
other
man
flush
deeply
and
then
become
very
pale
and
the
unsightly
scar
upon
his
forehead
showed
with
ghastly
distinctiveness
am
still
a
socialist
no
man
who
has
once
been
a
socialist
can
ever
cease
to
be
one
seem
to
have
accomplished
that
impossibility
to
judge
by
the
work
you
are
at
present
engaged
in
you
must
have
changed
your
opinions
since
you
were
here
last
one
who
has
been
a
socialist
can
ever
cease
to
be
one
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
who
has
once
acquired
knowledge
ever
to
relinquish
it
a
socialist
is
one
who
understands
the
causes
of
the
misery
and
degradation
we
see
all
around
us
who
knows
the
only
remedy
and
knows
that
that
remedy
the
state
of
society
that
will
be
called
socialism
must
eventually
be
adopted
is
the
only
alternative
to
the
extermination
of
the
majority
of
the
working
people
but
it
does
not
follow
that
everyone
who
has
sense
enough
to
acquire
that
amount
of
knowledge
must
in
addition
be
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
in
order
to
help
to
bring
that
state
of
society
into
being
when
i
first
acquired
that
knowledge
he
continued
bitterly
was
eager
to
tell
the
good
news
to
others
i
sacrificed
my
time
my
money
and
my
health
in
order
that
i
might
teach
others
what
i
had
learned
myself
i
did
it
willingly
and
happily
because
i
thought
they
would
be
glad
to
hear
and
that
they
were
worth
the
sacrifices
i
made
for
their
sakes
but
i
know
better
now
if
you
no
longer
believe
in
working
for
socialism
there
no
need
to
work
against
it
if
you
are
not
disposed
to
sacrifice
yourself
in
order
to
do
good
to
others
you
might
at
least
refrain
from
doing
evil
if
you
do
want
to
help
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
there
no
reason
why
you
should
help
to
perpetuate
the
present
system
the
other
man
laughed
bitterly
yes
there
is
and
a
very
good
reason
too
do
think
you
could
show
me
a
reason
said
barrington
the
man
with
the
scar
laughed
again
the
same
unpleasant
mirthless
laugh
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
trouser
pocket
drew
it
out
again
full
of
silver
coins
amongst
which
one
or
two
gold
pieces
glittered
is
my
reason
when
i
devoted
my
life
and
what
abilities
i
possess
to
the
service
of
my
fellow
workmen
when
i
sought
to
teach
them
how
to
break
their
chains
when
i
tried
to
show
them
how
they
might
save
their
children
from
poverty
and
shameful
servitude
i
did
not
want
them
to
give
me
money
i
did
it
for
love
and
they
paid
me
with
hatred
and
injury
but
since
i
have
been
helping
their
masters
to
rob
them
they
have
treated
me
with
respect
barrington
made
no
reply
and
the
other
man
having
returned
the
money
to
his
pocket
indicated
the
crowd
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
at
them
he
continued
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
at
them
the
people
you
are
trying
to
make
idealists
of
look
at
them
some
of
them
howling
and
roaring
like
wild
beasts
or
laughing
like
idiots
others
standing
with
dull
and
stupid
faces
devoid
of
any
trace
of
intelligence
or
expression
listening
to
the
speakers
whose
words
convey
no
meaning
to
their
stultified
minds
and
others
with
their
eyes
gleaming
with
savage
hatred
of
their
fellow
men
watching
eagerly
for
an
opportunity
to
provoke
a
quarrel
that
they
may
gratify
their
brutal
natures
by
striking
someone
their
eyes
are
hungry
for
the
sight
of
blood
ca
you
see
that
these
people
whom
you
are
trying
to
make
understand
your
plan
for
the
regeneration
of
the
world
your
doctrine
of
universal
brotherhood
and
love
are
for
the
most
part
intellectually
on
level
with
hottentots
the
only
things
they
feel
any
real
interest
in
are
beer
football
betting
and
of
course
one
other
subject
their
highest
ambition
is
to
be
allowed
to
work
and
they
desire
nothing
better
for
their
children
have
never
had
an
independent
thought
in
their
lives
these
are
the
people
whom
you
hope
to
inspire
with
lofty
ideals
you
might
just
as
well
try
to
make
a
gold
brooch
out
of
a
lump
of
dung
try
to
reason
with
them
to
uplift
them
to
teach
them
the
way
to
higher
things
devote
your
whole
life
and
intelligence
to
the
work
of
trying
to
get
better
conditions
for
them
and
you
will
find
that
they
themselves
are
the
enemy
you
will
have
to
fight
against
they
hate
you
and
if
they
get
the
chance
they
tear
you
to
pieces
but
if
you
a
sensible
man
you
use
whatever
talents
and
intelligence
you
possess
for
your
own
benefit
do
think
about
socialism
or
any
other
ism
concentrate
your
mind
on
getting
money
it
does
matter
how
you
get
it
but
get
it
if
you
ca
get
it
honestly
get
it
dishonestly
but
get
it
it
is
the
only
thing
that
counts
do
as
i
do
rob
them
exploit
them
and
then
they
have
some
respect
for
you
something
in
what
you
say
replied
barrington
after
a
long
pause
it
not
all
circumstances
make
us
what
we
are
and
anyhow
the
children
are
worth
fighting
for
may
think
so
now
said
the
other
you
come
to
see
it
my
way
some
day
as
for
the
children
if
their
parents
are
satisfied
to
let
them
grow
up
to
be
drudges
for
other
people
i
see
why
you
or
i
need
trouble
about
it
if
you
like
to
listen
to
reason
he
continued
after
a
pause
can
put
you
on
to
something
that
will
be
worth
more
to
you
than
all
your
socialism
do
you
mean
here
you
a
socialist
well
i
a
socialist
too
that
is
i
have
sense
enough
to
believe
that
socialism
is
practical
and
inevitable
and
right
it
will
come
when
the
majority
of
the
people
are
sufficiently
enlightened
to
demand
it
but
that
enlightenment
will
never
be
brought
about
by
reasoning
or
arguing
with
them
for
these
people
are
simply
not
intellectually
capable
of
abstract
reasoning
they
ca
grasp
theories
you
know
what
the
late
lord
salisbury
said
about
them
when
somebody
proposed
to
give
them
some
free
libraries
he
said
they
do
want
libraries
give
them
a
circus
you
see
these
liberals
and
tories
understand
the
sort
of
people
they
have
to
deal
with
they
know
that
although
their
bodies
are
the
bodies
of
grown
men
their
minds
are
the
minds
of
little
children
that
is
why
it
has
been
possible
to
deceive
and
bluff
and
rob
them
for
so
long
but
your
party
persists
in
regarding
them
as
rational
beings
and
that
where
you
make
a
mistake
you
simply
wasting
your
time
only
way
in
which
it
is
possible
to
teach
these
people
is
by
means
of
object
lessons
and
those
are
being
placed
before
them
in
increasing
numbers
every
day
the
trustification
of
industry
the
object
lesson
which
demonstrates
the
possibility
of
collective
ownership
will
in
time
compel
even
these
to
understand
and
by
the
time
they
have
learnt
that
they
will
also
have
learned
by
bitter
experience
and
not
from
theoretical
teaching
that
they
must
either
own
the
trusts
or
perish
and
then
and
not
till
then
they
will
achieve
socialism
but
meanwhile
we
have
this
election
do
you
think
it
will
make
any
real
difference
for
good
or
evil
which
of
these
two
men
is
elected
you
ca
keep
them
both
out
you
have
no
candidate
of
your
own
why
should
you
object
to
earning
a
few
pounds
by
helping
one
of
them
to
get
in
there
are
plenty
of
voters
who
are
doubtful
what
to
do
as
you
and
i
know
there
is
every
excuse
for
them
being
unable
to
make
up
their
minds
which
of
these
two
candidates
is
the
worse
a
word
from
your
party
would
decide
them
since
you
have
no
candidate
of
your
own
you
will
be
doing
no
harm
to
socialism
and
you
will
be
doing
yourself
a
bit
of
good
if
you
like
to
come
along
with
me
now
introduce
you
to
sweater
agent
no
one
need
know
anything
about
it
he
slipped
his
arm
through
barrington
but
the
latter
released
himself
yourself
said
the
other
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
know
your
own
business
best
you
may
choose
to
be
a
jesus
christ
if
you
like
but
for
my
part
i
finished
for
the
future
i
intend
to
look
after
myself
as
for
these
people
they
vote
for
what
they
want
they
get
what
they
vote
for
and
by
god
they
deserve
nothing
better
they
are
being
beaten
with
whips
of
their
own
choosing
and
if
i
had
my
way
they
should
be
chastised
with
scorpions
for
them
the
present
system
means
joyless
drudgery
rags
and
premature
death
they
vote
for
it
all
and
uphold
it
well
let
them
have
what
they
vote
for
let
them
drudge
let
them
starve
the
man
with
the
scarred
face
ceased
speaking
and
for
some
moments
barrington
did
not
reply
suppose
there
is
some
excuse
for
your
feeling
as
you
do
he
said
slowly
at
last
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
not
make
enough
allowance
for
the
circumstances
from
their
infancy
most
of
them
have
been
taught
by
priests
and
parents
to
regard
themselves
and
their
own
class
with
contempt
a
sort
of
lower
animals
and
to
regard
those
who
possess
wealth
with
veneration
as
superior
beings
the
idea
that
they
are
really
human
creatures
naturally
absolutely
the
same
as
their
betters
naturally
equal
in
every
way
naturally
different
from
them
only
in
those
ways
in
which
their
superiors
differ
from
each
other
and
inferior
to
them
only
because
they
have
been
deprived
of
education
culture
and
opportunity
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
they
have
all
been
taught
to
regard
that
idea
as
preposterous
christian
priests
who
say
with
their
tongues
in
their
cheeks
that
god
is
our
father
and
that
all
men
are
brethren
have
succeeded
in
convincing
the
majority
of
the
brethren
that
it
is
their
duty
to
be
content
in
their
degradation
and
to
order
themselves
lowly
and
reverently
towards
their
masters
your
resentment
should
be
directed
against
the
deceivers
not
against
the
dupes
the
other
man
laughed
bitterly
go
and
try
to
undeceive
them
he
said
as
he
returned
to
the
platform
in
response
to
a
call
from
his
associates
and
try
to
teach
them
that
the
supreme
being
made
the
earth
and
all
its
fullness
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
all
his
children
go
and
try
to
explain
to
them
that
they
are
poor
in
body
and
mind
and
social
condition
not
because
of
any
natural
inferiority
but
because
they
have
been
robbed
of
their
inheritance
go
and
try
to
show
them
how
to
secure
that
inheritance
for
themselves
and
their
children
and
see
how
grateful
they
be
to
you
for
the
next
hour
barrington
walked
about
the
crowded
streets
in
a
dispirited
fashion
his
conversation
with
the
renegade
seemed
to
have
taken
all
the
heart
out
of
him
he
still
had
a
number
of
the
leaflets
but
the
task
of
distributing
them
had
suddenly
grown
distasteful
and
after
a
while
he
discontinued
it
all
his
enthusiasm
was
gone
like
one
awakened
from
a
dream
he
saw
the
people
who
surrounded
him
in
a
different
light
for
the
first
time
he
properly
appreciated
the
offensiveness
of
most
of
those
to
whom
he
offered
the
handbills
some
without
even
troubling
to
ascertain
what
they
were
about
rudely
refused
to
accept
them
some
took
them
and
after
glancing
at
the
printing
crushed
them
in
their
hands
and
ostentatiously
threw
them
away
others
who
recognized
him
as
a
socialist
angrily
or
contemptuously
declined
them
often
with
curses
or
injurious
words
his
attention
was
presently
attracted
to
a
crowd
of
about
thirty
or
forty
people
congregated
near
a
gas
lamp
at
the
roadside
the
sound
of
many
angry
voices
rose
from
the
centre
of
this
group
and
as
he
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
barrington
being
tall
was
able
to
look
into
the
centre
where
he
saw
owen
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
fell
full
upon
the
latter
pale
face
as
he
stood
silent
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
infuriated
men
who
were
all
howling
at
him
at
once
and
whose
malignant
faces
bore
expressions
of
savage
hatred
as
they
shouted
out
the
foolish
accusations
and
slanders
they
had
read
in
the
liberal
and
tory
papers
socialists
wished
to
do
away
with
religion
and
morality
to
establish
free
love
and
atheism
all
the
money
that
the
working
classes
had
saved
up
in
the
post
office
and
the
friendly
societies
was
to
be
robbed
from
them
and
divided
up
amongst
a
lot
of
drunken
loafers
who
were
too
lazy
to
work
the
king
and
all
the
royal
family
were
to
be
done
away
with
and
so
on
owen
made
no
attempt
to
reply
and
the
manner
of
the
crowd
became
every
moment
more
threatening
it
was
evident
that
several
of
them
found
it
difficult
to
refrain
from
attacking
him
it
was
a
splendid
opportunity
of
doing
a
little
fighting
without
running
any
risks
this
fellow
was
all
by
himself
and
did
not
appear
to
be
much
of
a
man
even
at
that
those
in
the
middle
were
encouraged
by
shouts
from
others
in
the
crowd
who
urged
them
to
for
him
and
at
last
almost
at
the
instant
of
barrington
arrival
one
of
the
heroes
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
lifted
a
heavy
stick
and
struck
owen
savagely
across
the
face
the
sight
of
the
blood
maddened
the
others
and
in
an
instant
everyone
who
could
get
within
striking
distance
joined
furiously
in
the
onslaught
reaching
eagerly
over
each
other
shoulders
showering
blows
upon
him
with
sticks
and
fists
and
before
barrington
could
reach
his
side
they
had
owen
down
on
the
ground
and
had
begun
to
use
their
boots
upon
him
barrington
felt
like
a
wild
beast
himself
as
he
fiercely
fought
his
way
through
the
crowd
spurning
them
to
right
and
left
with
fists
and
elbows
he
reached
the
centre
in
time
to
seize
the
uplifted
arm
of
the
man
who
had
led
the
attack
and
wrenching
the
stick
from
his
hand
he
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
a
single
blow
the
remainder
shrank
back
and
meantime
the
crowd
was
augmented
by
others
who
came
running
up
some
of
these
newcomers
were
liberals
and
some
tories
and
as
these
did
not
know
what
the
row
was
about
they
attacked
each
other
the
liberals
went
for
those
who
wore
tory
colours
and
vice
versa
and
in
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
general
free
fight
though
most
of
the
original
crowd
ran
away
and
in
the
confusion
that
ended
barrington
and
owen
got
out
of
the
crowd
without
further
molestation
monday
was
the
last
day
of
the
election
polling
day
and
in
consequence
of
the
number
of
motor
cars
that
were
flying
about
the
streets
were
hardly
safe
for
ordinary
traffic
the
wealthy
persons
who
owned
these
carriages
the
result
of
the
poll
was
to
be
shown
on
an
illuminated
sign
at
the
town
hall
at
eleven
that
night
and
long
before
that
hour
a
vast
crowd
gathered
in
the
adjacent
streets
about
ten
it
began
to
rain
but
the
crowd
stood
its
ground
and
increased
in
numbers
as
the
time
went
by
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
the
rain
increased
to
a
terrible
downpour
but
the
people
remained
waiting
to
know
which
hero
had
conquered
eleven
came
and
an
intense
silence
fell
upon
the
crowd
whose
eyes
were
fixed
eagerly
upon
the
window
where
the
sign
was
to
be
exhibited
to
judge
by
the
extraordinary
interest
displayed
by
these
people
one
might
have
thought
that
they
expected
to
reap
some
great
benefit
or
to
sustain
some
great
loss
from
the
result
but
of
course
that
was
not
the
case
for
most
of
them
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
result
of
this
election
would
make
no
more
real
difference
to
them
than
all
the
other
elections
that
had
gone
before
they
wondered
what
the
figures
would
be
there
were
ten
thousand
voters
on
the
register
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
the
sign
was
illuminated
but
the
figures
were
not
yet
shown
next
the
names
of
the
two
candidates
were
slid
into
sight
the
figures
were
still
missing
but
name
was
on
top
and
a
hoarse
roar
of
triumph
came
from
the
throats
of
his
admirers
then
the
two
slides
with
the
names
were
withdrawn
and
the
sign
was
again
left
blank
after
a
time
the
people
began
to
murmur
at
all
this
delay
and
messing
about
and
presently
some
of
them
began
to
groan
and
hoot
after
a
few
minutes
the
names
were
again
slid
into
view
this
time
with
sweater
name
on
top
and
the
figures
appeared
immediately
afterwards
sweater
it
was
several
seconds
before
the
liberals
could
believe
their
eyes
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
was
the
reason
of
the
wild
outburst
of
delighted
enthusiasm
that
followed
but
whatever
the
reason
whatever
the
benefit
was
that
they
expected
to
reap
there
was
the
fact
they
were
all
cheering
and
dancing
and
shaking
hands
with
each
other
and
some
of
them
were
so
overcome
with
inexplicable
joy
that
they
were
scarcely
able
to
speak
it
was
altogether
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
a
few
minutes
after
the
declaration
sweater
appeared
at
the
window
and
made
a
sort
of
a
speech
but
only
fragments
of
it
were
audible
to
the
cheering
crowd
who
at
intervals
caught
such
phrases
as
blow
the
country
old
liberal
flag
and
so
on
next
appeared
and
he
was
seen
to
shake
hands
with
mr
sweater
whom
he
referred
to
as
friend
when
the
two
disappeared
from
the
window
the
part
of
the
liberal
crowd
that
was
not
engaged
in
fights
with
their
enemies
the
tories
made
a
rush
to
the
front
entrance
of
the
town
hall
where
sweater
carriage
was
waiting
and
as
soon
as
he
had
placed
his
plump
rotundity
inside
they
took
the
horses
out
and
amid
frantic
cheers
harnessed
themselves
to
it
instead
and
dragged
it
through
the
mud
and
the
pouring
rain
all
the
way
to
cave
most
of
them
were
accustomed
to
acting
as
beasts
of
burden
where
he
again
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
from
the
porch
afterwards
as
they
walked
home
saturated
with
rain
and
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
mud
they
said
it
was
a
great
victory
for
the
cause
of
progress
truly
the
wolves
have
an
easy
prey
chapter
the
undesired
that
evening
about
seven
whilst
easton
was
seeing
the
last
of
the
election
ruth
child
was
born
after
the
doctor
was
gone
mary
linden
stayed
with
her
during
the
hours
that
elapsed
before
easton
came
home
and
downstairs
elsie
and
charley
who
were
allowed
to
stay
up
late
to
help
their
mother
because
mrs
easton
was
ill
crept
about
very
quietly
and
conversed
in
hushed
tones
as
they
washed
up
the
tea
things
and
swept
the
floor
and
tidied
the
kitchen
easton
did
not
return
until
after
midnight
and
all
through
the
intervening
hours
ruth
weak
and
tired
but
unable
to
sleep
was
lying
in
bed
with
the
child
by
her
side
her
eyes
appeared
unnaturally
large
and
brilliant
in
contrast
with
the
almost
paleness
of
her
face
and
there
was
a
look
of
fear
in
them
as
she
waited
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
easton
footsteps
outside
the
silence
of
the
night
was
disturbed
by
many
unusual
noises
a
roar
as
of
the
breaking
of
waves
on
a
seashore
arose
from
the
direction
of
the
town
where
the
last
scenes
of
the
election
were
being
enacted
every
few
minutes
motor
cars
rushed
past
the
house
at
a
furious
rate
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
sounds
of
distant
shouts
and
singing
ruth
listened
and
started
nervously
at
every
passing
footstep
those
who
can
imagine
the
kind
of
expression
there
would
be
upon
the
face
of
a
hunted
thief
who
finding
himself
encompassed
and
brought
to
bay
by
his
pursuers
looks
wildly
around
in
a
vain
search
for
some
way
of
escape
may
be
able
to
form
some
conception
of
the
way
in
which
she
listened
to
every
sound
that
penetrated
into
the
stillness
of
the
dimly
lighted
room
and
ever
and
again
when
her
wandering
glance
reverted
to
the
frail
atom
of
humanity
nestling
by
her
side
her
brows
contracted
and
her
eyes
filled
with
bitter
tears
as
she
weakly
reached
out
her
trembling
hand
to
adjust
its
coverings
faintly
murmuring
with
quivering
lips
and
a
bursting
heart
some
words
of
endearment
and
pity
and
then
alarmed
by
the
footsteps
of
some
chance
passerby
or
by
the
closing
of
the
door
of
a
neighbouring
house
and
fearing
that
it
was
the
sound
she
had
been
waiting
for
and
dreading
through
all
those
weary
hours
she
would
turn
in
terror
to
mary
linden
sitting
in
the
chair
at
the
bedside
sewing
by
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
and
take
hold
of
her
arm
as
if
seeking
protection
from
some
impending
danger
it
was
after
twelve
when
easton
came
home
ruth
recognized
his
footsteps
before
he
reached
the
house
and
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
when
she
heard
the
clang
of
the
gate
as
it
closed
after
he
had
passed
through
it
had
been
mary
intention
to
withdraw
before
he
came
into
the
room
but
the
sick
woman
clung
to
her
in
such
evident
fear
and
entreated
her
so
earnestly
not
to
go
away
that
she
remained
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
keen
disappointment
that
easton
noticed
how
ruth
shrank
away
from
him
for
he
had
expected
and
hoped
that
after
this
they
would
be
good
friends
once
more
but
he
tried
to
think
that
it
was
because
she
was
ill
and
when
she
would
not
let
him
touch
the
child
lest
he
should
awaken
it
he
agreed
without
question
the
next
day
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
during
the
next
fortnight
ruth
was
in
a
raging
fever
there
were
intervals
when
although
weak
and
exhausted
she
was
in
her
right
mind
but
most
of
the
time
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
her
surroundings
and
often
delirious
mrs
owen
came
every
day
to
help
to
look
after
her
because
mary
just
then
had
a
lot
of
needlework
to
do
and
consequently
could
only
give
part
of
her
time
to
ruth
who
in
her
delirium
lived
and
told
over
and
over
again
all
the
sorrow
and
suffering
of
the
last
few
months
and
so
the
two
friends
watching
by
her
bedside
learned
her
dreadful
secret
sometimes
in
her
delirium
she
seemed
possessed
of
an
intense
and
terrible
loathing
for
the
poor
little
creature
she
had
brought
into
the
world
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
doing
it
violence
once
she
seized
it
cruelly
and
threw
it
fiercely
from
her
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
as
if
it
had
been
some
poisonous
or
loathsome
thing
and
so
it
often
became
necessary
to
take
the
child
away
out
of
the
room
so
that
she
could
not
see
or
hear
it
but
when
her
senses
came
back
to
her
her
first
thought
was
for
the
child
and
there
must
have
been
in
her
mind
some
faint
recollection
of
what
she
had
said
and
done
in
her
madness
for
when
she
saw
that
the
baby
was
not
in
its
accustomed
place
her
distress
and
alarm
were
painful
to
see
as
she
entreated
them
with
tears
to
give
it
back
to
her
and
then
she
would
kiss
and
fondle
it
with
all
manner
of
endearing
words
and
cry
bitterly
easton
did
not
see
or
hear
most
of
this
he
only
knew
that
she
was
very
ill
for
he
went
out
every
day
on
the
almost
hopeless
quest
for
work
rushton
had
next
to
nothing
to
do
and
most
of
the
other
shops
were
in
a
similar
plight
dauber
and
botchit
had
one
or
two
jobs
going
on
and
easton
tried
several
times
to
get
a
start
for
them
but
was
always
told
they
were
full
up
the
sweating
methods
of
this
firm
continued
to
form
a
favourite
topic
of
conversation
with
the
unemployed
workmen
who
railed
at
and
cursed
them
horribly
it
had
leaked
out
that
they
were
paying
only
sixpence
an
hour
to
most
of
the
skilled
workmen
in
their
employment
and
even
then
the
conditions
under
which
they
worked
were
if
possible
worse
than
those
obtaining
at
most
other
firms
the
men
were
treated
like
so
many
convicts
and
every
job
was
a
hell
where
driving
and
bullying
reigned
supreme
and
obscene
curses
and
blasphemy
polluted
the
air
from
morning
till
night
the
resentment
of
those
who
were
out
of
work
was
directed
not
only
against
the
heads
of
the
firm
but
also
against
the
miserable
drudges
in
their
employment
these
poor
wretches
were
denounced
as
and
by
the
unemployed
workmen
but
all
the
same
whenever
dauber
and
botchit
wanted
some
extra
hands
they
never
had
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
them
and
it
often
happened
that
those
who
had
been
loudest
and
bitterest
in
their
denunciations
were
amongst
the
first
to
rush
off
eagerly
to
apply
there
for
a
job
whenever
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
one
frequently
the
light
was
seen
burning
late
at
night
in
office
where
nimrod
and
his
master
were
figuring
out
prices
and
writing
out
estimates
cutting
down
the
amounts
to
the
lowest
possible
point
in
the
hope
of
underbidding
their
rivals
now
and
then
they
were
successful
but
whether
they
secured
the
work
or
not
nimrod
always
appeared
equally
miserable
if
they
got
the
it
often
showed
such
a
small
margin
of
profit
that
rushton
used
to
grumble
at
him
and
suggest
mismanagement
if
their
estimates
were
too
high
and
they
lost
the
work
he
used
to
demand
of
nimrod
why
it
was
possible
for
dauber
and
botchit
to
do
work
so
much
more
cheaply
as
the
unemployed
workmen
stood
in
groups
at
the
corners
or
walked
aimlessly
about
the
streets
they
often
saw
hunter
pass
by
on
his
bicycle
looking
worried
and
harassed
he
was
such
a
picture
of
misery
that
it
began
to
be
rumoured
amongst
the
men
that
he
had
never
been
the
same
since
the
time
he
had
that
fall
off
the
bike
and
some
of
them
declared
that
they
would
mind
betting
that
ole
misery
would
finish
up
by
going
off
his
bloody
rocker
at
intervals
whenever
a
job
came
in
owen
crass
slyme
sawkins
and
one
or
two
others
continued
to
be
employed
at
rushton
but
they
seldom
managed
to
make
more
than
two
or
three
days
a
week
even
when
there
was
anything
to
do
chapter
sundered
during
the
next
few
weeks
ruth
continued
very
ill
although
the
delirium
had
left
her
and
did
not
return
her
manner
was
still
very
strange
and
it
was
remarkable
that
she
slept
but
little
and
at
long
intervals
mrs
owen
came
to
look
after
her
every
day
not
going
back
to
her
own
home
till
the
evening
frankie
used
to
call
for
her
as
he
came
out
of
school
and
then
they
used
to
go
home
together
taking
little
freddie
easton
with
them
also
for
his
own
mother
was
not
able
to
look
after
him
and
mary
linden
had
so
much
other
work
to
do
on
wednesday
evening
when
the
child
was
about
five
weeks
old
as
mrs
owen
was
wishing
her
good
night
ruth
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
after
saying
how
grateful
she
was
for
all
that
she
had
done
she
asked
whether
supposing
anything
happened
to
herself
nora
would
promise
to
take
charge
of
freddie
for
easton
owen
wife
gave
the
required
promise
at
the
same
time
affecting
to
regard
the
supposition
as
altogether
unlikely
and
assuring
her
that
she
would
soon
be
better
but
she
secretly
wondered
why
ruth
had
not
mentioned
the
other
child
as
well
nora
went
away
about
five
leaving
ruth
bedroom
door
open
so
that
mrs
linden
could
hear
her
call
if
she
needed
anything
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
nora
and
the
two
children
had
gone
mary
linden
went
upstairs
to
see
ruth
who
appeared
to
have
fallen
fast
asleep
so
she
returned
to
her
needlework
downstairs
the
weather
had
been
very
cloudy
all
day
there
had
been
rain
at
intervals
and
it
was
a
dark
evening
so
dark
that
she
had
to
light
the
lamp
to
see
her
work
charley
sat
on
the
hearthrug
in
front
of
the
fire
repairing
one
of
the
wheels
of
a
wooden
cart
that
he
had
made
with
the
assistance
of
another
boy
and
elsie
busied
herself
preparing
the
tea
easton
was
not
yet
home
rushton
had
a
few
jobs
to
do
and
he
had
been
at
work
since
the
previous
thursday
the
place
where
he
was
working
was
some
considerable
distance
away
so
it
was
nearly
half
past
six
when
he
came
home
they
heard
him
at
the
gate
and
at
her
direction
elsie
went
quickly
to
the
front
door
which
was
ajar
to
ask
him
to
walk
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
wake
ruth
mary
had
prepared
the
table
for
his
tea
in
the
kitchen
where
there
was
a
bright
fire
with
the
kettle
singing
on
the
hob
he
lit
the
lamp
and
after
removing
his
hat
and
overcoat
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
it
to
boil
he
went
softly
upstairs
there
was
no
lamp
burning
in
the
bedroom
and
the
place
would
have
been
in
utter
darkness
but
for
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
which
did
not
dispel
the
prevailing
obscurity
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
discern
the
different
objects
in
the
room
distinctly
the
intense
silence
that
reigned
struck
him
with
a
sudden
terror
he
crossed
swiftly
over
to
the
bed
and
a
moment
examination
sufficed
to
tell
him
that
it
was
empty
he
called
her
name
but
there
was
no
answer
and
a
hurried
search
only
made
it
certain
that
she
was
nowhere
in
the
house
mrs
linden
now
remembered
what
owen
wife
had
told
her
of
the
strange
request
that
ruth
had
made
and
as
she
recounted
it
to
easton
his
fears
became
intensified
a
thousandfold
he
was
unable
to
form
any
opinion
of
the
reason
of
her
going
or
of
where
she
had
gone
as
he
rushed
out
to
seek
for
her
almost
unconsciously
he
directed
his
steps
to
owen
house
and
afterwards
the
two
men
went
to
every
place
where
they
thought
it
possible
she
might
have
gone
but
without
finding
any
trace
of
her
her
father
lived
a
short
distance
outside
the
town
and
this
was
one
of
the
first
places
they
went
to
although
easton
did
not
think
it
likely
she
would
go
there
for
she
had
not
been
on
friendly
terms
with
her
stepmother
and
as
he
had
anticipated
it
was
a
fruitless
journey
they
sought
for
her
in
every
conceivable
place
returning
often
to
easton
house
to
see
if
she
had
come
home
but
they
found
no
trace
of
her
nor
met
anyone
who
had
seen
her
which
was
perhaps
because
the
dreary
streets
were
deserted
by
all
except
those
whose
business
compelled
them
to
be
out
about
eleven
nora
was
standing
at
the
front
door
waiting
for
owen
and
easton
when
she
thought
she
could
discern
a
woman
figure
in
the
shadow
of
the
piers
of
the
gate
opposite
it
was
an
unoccupied
house
with
a
garden
in
front
and
the
outlines
of
the
bushes
it
contained
were
so
vague
in
the
darkness
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
certain
but
the
longer
she
looked
the
more
convinced
she
became
that
there
was
someone
there
at
last
she
summoned
sufficient
courage
to
cross
over
the
road
and
as
she
nervously
drew
near
the
gate
it
became
evident
that
she
had
not
been
mistaken
there
was
a
woman
standing
there
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
and
holding
the
iron
bars
of
the
gate
with
her
left
hand
it
was
ruth
nora
recognized
her
even
in
the
her
attitude
was
one
of
extreme
exhaustion
and
as
nora
touched
her
she
perceived
that
she
was
wet
through
and
trembling
but
although
she
was
almost
fainting
with
fatigue
she
would
not
consent
to
go
indoors
until
repeatedly
assured
that
easton
was
not
there
and
that
nora
would
not
let
him
see
her
if
he
came
and
when
at
length
she
yielded
and
went
into
the
house
she
would
not
sit
down
or
take
off
her
hat
or
jacket
until
crouching
on
the
floor
beside
nora
chair
with
her
face
hidden
in
the
latter
lap
she
had
sobbed
out
her
pitiful
confession
the
same
things
that
she
had
unwittingly
told
to
the
same
hearer
so
often
before
during
the
illness
the
only
fact
that
was
new
was
the
account
of
her
wanderings
that
night
she
cried
so
bitterly
and
looked
so
forlorn
and
heartbroken
and
ashamed
as
she
faltered
out
her
woeful
story
so
consumed
with
making
no
excuse
for
herself
except
to
repeat
over
and
over
again
that
she
had
never
meant
to
do
wrong
that
nora
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
also
as
she
listened
it
appeared
that
unable
to
bear
the
reproach
that
easton
presence
seemed
to
imply
or
to
endure
the
burden
of
her
secret
any
longer
and
always
haunted
by
the
thought
of
the
lake
in
the
park
ruth
had
formed
the
dreadful
resolution
of
taking
her
own
life
and
the
child
when
she
arrived
at
the
park
gates
they
were
closed
and
locked
for
the
night
but
she
remembered
that
there
was
another
means
of
entering
the
place
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
where
the
park
was
not
fenced
in
so
she
had
gone
there
nearly
three
miles
only
to
find
that
railings
had
recently
been
erected
and
therefore
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
get
into
the
park
by
that
way
and
then
when
she
found
it
impossible
to
put
her
resolve
into
practice
she
had
realized
for
the
first
time
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
the
act
she
had
meant
to
commit
but
although
she
had
abandoned
her
first
intention
she
said
she
could
never
go
home
again
she
would
take
a
room
somewhere
and
get
some
work
to
do
or
perhaps
she
might
be
able
to
get
a
situation
where
they
would
allow
her
to
have
the
child
with
her
or
failing
that
she
would
work
and
pay
someone
to
look
after
it
but
she
could
never
go
home
any
more
if
she
only
had
somewhere
to
stay
for
a
few
days
until
she
could
get
something
to
do
she
was
sure
she
would
be
able
to
earn
her
living
but
she
could
not
go
back
home
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
walk
about
the
streets
all
night
than
go
there
again
it
was
arranged
that
ruth
should
have
the
small
apartment
which
had
been
frankie
playroom
the
necessary
furniture
being
obtained
from
a
shop
close
by
easton
did
not
learn
the
real
reason
of
her
flight
until
three
days
afterwards
at
first
he
attributed
it
to
a
recurrence
of
the
mental
disorder
that
she
had
suffered
from
after
the
birth
of
the
child
and
he
had
been
glad
to
leave
her
at
owen
place
in
nora
care
but
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
when
he
returned
home
from
work
he
found
a
letter
in
ruth
handwriting
which
told
him
all
there
was
to
tell
when
he
recovered
from
the
stupefaction
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
the
perusal
of
this
letter
his
first
thought
was
to
seek
out
slyme
but
he
found
upon
inquiring
that
the
latter
had
left
the
town
the
previous
morning
slyme
landlady
said
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
been
offered
several
months
work
in
london
which
he
had
accepted
the
truth
was
that
slyme
had
heard
of
ruth
flight
nearly
everyone
knew
about
it
as
a
result
of
the
inquiries
that
had
been
made
for
her
and
guessing
the
cause
he
had
prudently
cleared
out
easton
made
no
attempt
to
see
ruth
but
he
went
to
owen
and
took
freddie
away
saying
he
would
pay
mrs
linden
to
look
after
the
child
whilst
he
was
at
work
his
manner
was
that
of
a
deeply
injured
man
the
possibility
that
he
was
in
any
way
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
his
mind
at
all
as
for
ruth
she
made
no
resistance
to
his
taking
the
child
away
from
her
although
she
cried
about
it
in
secret
she
got
some
work
a
few
days
afterwards
helping
the
servants
at
one
of
the
large
on
the
grand
parade
nora
looked
after
the
baby
for
her
while
she
was
at
work
an
arrangement
that
pleased
frankie
vastly
he
said
it
was
almost
as
good
as
having
a
baby
of
their
very
own
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
ruth
went
away
easton
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
not
very
much
regret
what
had
happened
mrs
linden
looked
after
freddie
and
easton
tried
to
believe
that
he
would
really
be
better
off
now
that
he
had
only
himself
and
the
child
to
provide
for
at
first
whenever
he
happened
to
meet
owen
they
used
to
speak
of
ruth
or
to
be
more
correct
easton
used
to
speak
of
her
but
one
day
when
the
two
men
were
working
together
owen
had
expressed
himself
rather
offensively
he
seemed
to
think
that
easton
was
more
to
blame
than
she
was
and
afterwards
they
avoided
the
subject
although
easton
found
it
difficult
to
avoid
the
thoughts
the
other
man
words
suggested
now
and
then
he
heard
of
ruth
and
learnt
that
she
was
still
working
at
the
same
place
and
once
he
met
her
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
in
the
street
they
passed
each
other
hurriedly
and
he
did
not
see
the
scarlet
flush
that
for
an
instant
dyed
her
face
nor
the
deathly
pallor
that
succeeded
it
he
never
went
to
owen
place
or
sent
any
communication
to
ruth
nor
did
she
ever
send
him
any
but
although
easton
did
not
know
it
she
frequently
saw
freddie
for
when
elsie
linden
took
the
child
out
she
often
called
to
see
mrs
owen
as
time
went
on
and
the
resentment
he
had
felt
towards
her
lost
its
first
bitterness
easton
began
to
think
there
was
perhaps
some
little
justification
for
what
owen
had
said
and
gradually
there
grew
within
him
an
immense
desire
for
reconciliation
to
start
afresh
and
to
forget
all
that
had
happened
but
the
more
he
thought
of
this
the
more
hopeless
and
impossible
of
realization
it
seemed
although
perhaps
he
was
not
conscious
of
it
this
desire
arose
solely
from
selfish
motives
the
money
he
earned
seemed
to
melt
away
almost
as
soon
as
he
received
it
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
he
was
not
nearly
so
well
off
in
regard
to
personal
comfort
as
he
had
been
formerly
and
the
house
seemed
to
grow
more
dreary
and
desolate
as
the
wintry
days
dragged
slowly
by
sometimes
when
he
had
the
money
he
sought
forgetfulness
in
the
society
of
crass
and
the
other
frequenters
of
the
cricketers
but
somehow
or
other
he
could
not
take
the
same
pleasure
in
the
conversation
of
these
people
as
formerly
when
he
had
found
it
as
he
now
sometimes
wondered
to
remember
so
entertaining
as
to
almost
make
him
forget
ruth
existence
one
evening
about
three
weeks
before
christmas
as
he
and
owen
were
walking
homewards
together
from
work
easton
reverted
for
the
first
time
to
their
former
conversation
he
spoke
with
a
superior
air
his
manner
and
tone
indicating
that
he
thought
he
was
behaving
with
great
generosity
he
would
be
willing
to
forgive
her
and
have
her
back
he
said
if
she
would
come
but
he
would
never
be
able
to
tolerate
the
child
of
course
it
might
be
sent
to
an
orphanage
or
some
similar
institution
but
he
was
afraid
ruth
would
never
consent
to
that
and
he
knew
that
her
stepmother
would
not
take
it
you
can
persuade
her
to
return
to
you
we
take
the
child
said
owen
you
think
your
wife
would
be
willing
has
already
suggested
doing
so
ruth
to
me
we
thought
it
a
possible
way
for
you
and
my
wife
would
like
to
have
the
child
would
you
be
able
to
afford
it
said
easton
should
manage
all
right
course
said
easton
slyme
comes
back
he
might
agree
to
pay
something
for
its
keep
owen
flushed
would
take
his
money
after
a
long
pause
easton
continued
you
mind
asking
mrs
owen
to
suggest
it
to
ruth
you
like
i
get
her
to
suggest
it
as
a
message
from
you
i
meant
said
easton
hesitatingly
that
your
wife
might
just
suggest
it
casual
like
and
advise
her
that
it
would
be
the
best
way
and
then
you
could
let
me
know
what
ruth
said
replied
owen
unable
any
longer
to
control
his
resentment
of
the
other
manner
things
stand
now
if
it
were
not
for
the
other
child
i
should
advise
her
to
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
you
you
seem
to
think
that
you
are
acting
a
very
generous
part
in
being
willing
to
have
her
back
but
she
better
off
now
than
she
was
with
you
i
see
no
reason
except
for
the
other
child
why
she
should
go
back
to
you
as
far
as
i
understand
it
you
had
a
good
wife
and
you
her
never
her
i
never
raised
my
hand
to
her
at
least
only
once
and
then
i
did
hurt
her
does
she
say
i
her
no
from
what
my
wife
tells
me
she
only
blames
herself
but
drawing
my
own
conclusions
you
may
not
have
struck
her
but
you
did
worse
you
treated
her
with
indifference
and
exposed
her
to
temptation
what
has
happened
is
the
natural
result
of
your
neglect
and
want
of
care
for
her
the
responsibility
for
what
has
happened
is
mainly
yours
but
apparently
you
wish
to
pose
now
as
being
very
generous
and
to
forgive
her
you
willing
to
take
her
back
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
more
fitting
that
you
should
ask
her
to
forgive
you
easton
made
no
answer
and
after
a
long
silence
the
other
continued
would
not
advise
her
to
go
back
to
you
on
such
terms
as
you
seem
to
think
right
because
if
you
became
reconciled
on
such
terms
i
think
either
of
you
could
be
happy
your
only
chance
of
happiness
is
to
realize
that
you
have
both
done
wrong
that
each
of
you
has
something
to
forgive
to
forgive
and
never
speak
of
it
again
easton
made
no
reply
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
their
ways
diverging
they
wished
each
other
night
they
were
working
for
rushton
painting
the
outside
of
a
new
conservatory
at
mr
sweater
house
cave
this
job
was
finished
the
next
day
and
at
four
the
boy
brought
the
handcart
which
they
loaded
with
their
ladders
and
other
materials
they
took
these
back
to
the
yard
and
then
as
it
was
friday
night
they
went
up
to
the
front
shop
and
handed
in
their
time
sheets
afterwards
as
they
were
about
to
separate
easton
again
referred
to
the
subject
of
their
conversation
of
the
previous
evening
he
had
been
very
reserved
and
silent
all
day
scarcely
uttering
a
word
except
when
the
work
they
had
been
engaged
in
made
it
necessary
to
do
so
and
there
was
now
a
sort
of
catch
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
last
night
it
quite
true
i
been
a
great
deal
to
blame
i
wrote
to
ruth
last
night
and
admitted
it
to
her
i
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
and
your
wife
will
say
what
you
can
to
help
me
get
her
back
owen
stretched
out
his
hand
and
as
the
other
took
it
said
may
rely
on
us
both
to
do
our
best
chapter
the
widow
son
the
next
morning
when
they
went
to
the
yard
at
half
past
eight
hunter
told
them
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
that
they
had
better
come
on
monday
in
case
some
work
came
in
they
accordingly
went
on
the
monday
and
tuesday
and
wednesday
but
as
nothing
in
of
course
they
did
not
do
any
work
on
thursday
morning
the
weather
was
dark
and
bitterly
cold
the
sky
presented
an
unbroken
expanse
of
dull
grey
and
a
keen
north
wind
swept
through
the
cheerless
streets
owen
who
had
caught
cold
whilst
painting
the
outside
of
the
conservatory
at
sweater
house
the
previous
week
did
not
get
to
the
yard
until
ten
he
felt
so
ill
that
he
would
not
have
gone
at
all
if
they
had
not
needed
the
money
he
would
be
able
to
earn
if
there
was
anything
to
do
strange
though
it
may
appear
to
the
advocates
of
thrift
although
he
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
in
employment
when
so
many
others
were
idle
they
had
not
saved
any
money
on
the
contrary
during
all
the
summer
they
had
not
been
able
to
afford
to
have
proper
food
or
clothing
every
week
most
of
the
money
went
to
pay
arrears
of
rent
or
some
other
debts
so
that
even
whilst
he
was
at
work
they
had
often
to
go
without
some
of
the
necessaries
of
life
they
had
broken
boots
shabby
insufficient
clothing
and
barely
enough
to
eat
the
weather
had
become
so
bitterly
cold
that
fearing
he
would
be
laid
up
if
he
went
without
it
any
longer
he
took
his
overcoat
out
of
pawn
and
that
week
they
had
to
almost
starve
not
that
it
was
much
better
other
weeks
for
lately
he
had
only
been
making
six
and
a
half
hours
a
day
from
in
the
morning
till
four
in
the
evening
and
on
saturday
only
four
and
a
half
hours
from
half
past
eight
till
one
this
made
his
wages
at
sevenpence
an
hour
shillings
and
sevenpence
a
week
that
is
when
there
was
work
to
do
every
day
which
was
not
always
sometimes
they
had
to
stand
idle
three
days
out
of
six
the
wages
of
those
who
got
sixpence
halfpenny
came
out
at
one
pound
and
twopence
when
they
worked
every
day
and
as
for
those
who
like
sawkins
received
only
fivepence
their
week
wages
amounted
to
fifteen
and
sixpence
when
they
were
only
employed
for
two
or
three
days
or
perhaps
only
a
few
hours
their
night
sometimes
amounted
to
half
a
sovereign
seven
and
sixpence
five
shillings
or
even
less
then
most
of
them
said
that
it
was
better
than
nothing
at
all
many
of
them
were
married
men
so
in
order
to
make
existence
possible
their
wives
went
out
charing
or
worked
in
laundries
they
had
children
whom
they
had
to
bring
up
for
the
most
part
on
milk
bread
margarine
and
adulterated
tea
many
of
these
children
little
mites
of
eight
or
nine
years
went
to
work
for
two
or
three
hours
in
the
morning
before
going
to
school
the
same
in
the
evening
after
school
and
all
day
on
saturday
carrying
butchers
trays
loaded
with
meat
baskets
of
groceries
and
vegetables
cans
of
paraffin
oil
selling
or
delivering
newspapers
and
carrying
milk
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
they
got
half
time
certificates
and
directly
they
were
fourteen
they
left
school
altogether
and
went
to
work
all
the
day
when
they
were
old
enough
some
of
them
tried
to
join
the
army
or
navy
but
were
found
physically
unfit
it
is
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
when
they
became
a
little
older
they
were
so
degenerate
intellectually
that
they
imagined
that
the
surest
way
to
obtain
better
conditions
would
be
to
elect
gangs
of
liberal
and
tory
sweaters
swindlers
and
lawyers
to
rule
over
them
when
owen
arrived
at
the
yard
he
found
bert
white
cleaning
out
the
dirty
pots
in
the
the
noise
he
made
with
the
scraping
knife
prevented
him
from
hearing
owen
approach
and
the
latter
stood
watching
him
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
the
stone
floor
of
the
paint
shop
was
damp
and
shiny
and
the
whole
place
was
chilly
as
a
tomb
the
boy
was
trembling
with
cold
and
he
looked
pitifully
undersized
and
frail
as
he
bent
over
his
work
with
an
old
apron
girt
about
him
because
it
was
so
cold
he
was
wearing
his
jacket
with
the
ends
of
the
sleeves
turned
back
to
keep
them
clean
or
to
prevent
them
getting
any
dirtier
for
they
were
already
in
the
same
condition
as
the
rest
of
his
attire
which
was
thickly
encrusted
with
dried
paint
of
many
colours
and
his
hands
and
fingernails
were
grimed
with
it
as
he
watched
the
poor
boy
bending
over
his
task
owen
thought
of
frankie
and
with
a
feeling
akin
to
terror
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
be
in
a
similar
plight
when
he
saw
owen
the
boy
left
off
working
and
wished
him
good
morning
remarking
that
it
was
very
cold
do
you
light
a
fire
there
lots
of
wood
lying
about
the
yard
said
bert
shaking
his
head
would
never
do
misery
would
ramp
if
caught
me
at
it
i
used
to
a
fire
last
winter
till
rushton
found
out
and
kicked
up
an
orful
row
and
told
me
to
move
meself
and
get
some
work
done
and
then
i
would
feel
the
cold
he
said
that
did
he
said
owen
his
pale
face
becoming
suddenly
suffused
with
blood
see
about
that
he
went
out
into
the
yard
and
crossing
over
to
where
under
a
shed
there
was
a
great
heap
of
waste
wood
stuff
that
had
been
taken
out
of
places
where
rushton
had
made
alterations
he
gathered
an
armful
of
it
and
was
returning
to
the
paintshop
when
sawkins
accosted
him
must
go
burnin
any
of
that
you
know
that
all
got
to
be
saved
and
took
up
to
the
bloke
house
misery
spoke
about
it
only
this
mornin
owen
did
not
answer
him
he
carried
the
wood
into
the
shop
and
after
throwing
it
into
the
fireplace
he
poured
some
old
paint
over
it
and
applying
a
match
produced
a
roaring
fire
then
he
brought
in
several
more
armfuls
of
wood
and
piled
them
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
bert
took
no
part
in
these
proceedings
and
at
first
rather
disapproved
of
them
because
he
was
afraid
there
would
be
trouble
when
misery
came
but
when
the
fire
was
an
accomplished
fact
he
warmed
his
hands
and
shifted
his
work
to
the
other
side
of
the
bench
so
as
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
heat
owen
waited
for
about
half
an
hour
to
see
if
hunter
would
return
but
as
that
disciple
did
not
appear
he
decided
not
to
wait
any
longer
before
leaving
he
gave
bert
some
instructions
up
the
fire
with
all
the
old
paint
that
you
can
scrape
off
those
things
and
any
other
old
paint
or
rubbish
that
here
and
whenever
it
grows
dull
put
more
wood
on
there
a
lot
of
old
stuff
here
that
of
no
use
except
to
be
thrown
away
or
burnt
burn
it
all
if
hunter
says
anything
tell
him
that
i
lit
the
fire
and
that
i
told
you
to
keep
it
burning
if
you
want
more
wood
go
out
and
take
it
right
replied
bert
on
his
way
out
owen
spoke
to
sawkins
his
manner
was
so
menacing
his
face
so
pale
and
there
was
such
a
strange
glare
in
his
eyes
that
the
latter
thought
of
the
talk
there
had
been
about
owen
being
mad
and
felt
half
afraid
of
him
am
going
to
the
office
to
see
rushton
if
hunter
comes
here
you
say
i
told
you
to
tell
him
that
if
i
find
the
boy
in
that
shop
again
without
a
fire
i
report
it
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
and
as
for
you
if
the
boy
comes
out
here
to
get
more
wood
do
you
attempt
to
interfere
with
him
do
want
to
interfere
with
the
bloody
kid
grunted
sawkins
seems
to
me
as
if
he
gorn
orf
bloody
crumpet
he
added
as
he
watched
owen
walking
rapidly
down
the
street
ca
understand
why
people
ca
mind
their
own
bloody
business
anyone
would
think
the
boy
belonged
to
that
was
just
how
the
matter
presented
itself
to
owen
the
idea
that
it
was
his
own
child
who
was
to
be
treated
in
this
way
possessed
and
infuriated
him
as
he
strode
savagely
along
in
the
vicinity
of
the
slave
market
on
the
grand
parade
he
passed
without
seeing
them
several
groups
of
unemployed
artisans
whom
he
knew
some
of
them
were
offended
and
remarked
that
he
was
getting
stuck
up
but
others
observing
how
strange
he
looked
repeated
the
old
prophecy
that
one
of
these
days
owen
would
go
out
of
his
mind
as
he
drew
near
to
his
destination
large
flakes
of
snow
began
to
fall
he
walked
so
rapidly
and
was
in
such
a
fury
that
by
the
time
he
reached
the
shop
he
was
scarcely
able
to
speak
hunter
or
rushton
here
he
demanded
of
the
shopman
is
but
the
is
what
was
it
you
wanted
soon
know
that
panted
owen
as
he
strode
up
to
the
office
door
and
without
troubling
to
knock
flung
it
violently
open
and
entered
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
damp
cellar
where
bert
was
working
a
grate
fitted
with
asbestos
blocks
and
lit
with
gas
communicated
a
genial
warmth
to
the
air
rushton
was
standing
leaning
over
miss
wade
chair
with
his
left
arm
round
her
neck
owen
recollected
afterwards
that
her
dress
was
disarranged
she
retired
hastily
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
as
rushton
jumped
away
from
her
and
stared
in
amazement
and
confusion
at
the
intruder
he
was
too
astonished
and
embarrassed
to
speak
owen
stood
panting
and
quivering
in
the
middle
of
the
office
and
pointed
a
trembling
finger
at
his
employer
come
here
to
tell
you
that
if
i
find
young
bert
white
working
down
in
that
shop
without
a
fire
i
have
you
prosecuted
the
place
is
not
good
enough
for
a
stable
if
you
owned
a
valuable
dog
you
would
keep
it
there
i
give
you
fair
warning
i
know
enough
about
you
to
put
you
where
you
deserve
to
be
if
you
do
treat
him
better
i
have
you
punished
i
show
you
up
rushton
continued
to
stare
at
him
in
mingled
confusion
fear
and
perplexity
he
did
not
yet
comprehend
exactly
what
it
was
all
about
he
was
guiltily
conscious
of
so
many
things
which
he
might
reasonably
fear
to
be
shown
up
or
prosecuted
for
if
they
were
known
and
the
fact
of
being
caught
under
such
circumstances
with
miss
wade
helped
to
reduce
him
to
a
condition
approaching
terror
the
boy
has
been
there
without
a
fire
i
known
anything
about
it
he
stammered
at
last
has
charge
of
all
those
matters
yourself
forbade
him
to
make
a
fire
last
winter
and
anyhow
you
know
about
it
now
you
obtained
money
from
his
mother
under
the
pretence
that
you
were
going
to
teach
him
a
trade
but
for
the
last
twelve
months
you
have
been
using
him
as
if
he
were
a
beast
of
burden
i
advise
you
to
see
to
it
or
i
shall
find
means
to
make
you
wish
you
had
done
so
with
this
owen
turned
and
went
out
leaving
the
door
open
and
rushton
in
a
state
of
mind
compounded
of
fear
amazement
and
anger
as
he
walked
homewards
through
the
owen
began
to
realize
that
the
consequence
of
what
he
had
done
would
be
that
rushton
would
not
give
him
any
more
work
and
as
he
reflected
on
all
that
this
would
mean
to
those
at
home
for
a
moment
he
doubted
whether
he
had
done
right
but
when
he
told
nora
what
had
happened
she
said
there
were
plenty
of
other
firms
in
the
town
who
would
employ
him
when
they
had
the
work
he
had
done
without
rushton
before
and
could
do
so
again
for
her
part
whatever
the
consequences
might
be
she
was
glad
that
he
had
acted
as
he
did
get
through
somehow
i
suppose
said
owen
wearily
not
much
chance
of
getting
a
job
anywhere
else
just
now
but
i
shall
try
to
get
some
work
on
my
own
account
i
shall
do
some
samples
of
the
same
as
i
did
last
winter
and
try
to
get
orders
from
some
of
the
shops
they
usually
want
something
extra
at
this
time
but
i
afraid
it
is
rather
too
late
most
of
them
already
have
all
they
want
should
go
out
again
today
if
i
were
you
said
nora
noticing
how
ill
he
looked
should
stay
at
home
and
read
or
write
up
those
minutes
the
minutes
referred
to
were
those
of
the
last
meeting
of
the
local
branch
of
the
painters
society
of
which
owen
was
the
secretary
and
as
the
snow
continued
to
fall
he
occupied
himself
after
dinner
in
the
manner
his
wife
suggested
until
four
when
frankie
returned
from
school
bringing
with
him
a
large
snowball
and
crying
out
as
a
piece
of
good
news
that
the
snow
was
still
falling
heavily
and
that
he
believed
it
was
freezing
they
went
to
bed
very
early
that
night
for
it
was
necessary
to
economize
the
coal
and
not
only
that
but
because
the
rooms
were
so
near
the
roof
it
was
not
possible
to
keep
the
place
warm
no
matter
how
much
coal
was
used
the
fire
seemed
if
anything
to
make
the
place
colder
for
it
caused
the
outer
air
to
pour
in
through
the
joints
of
the
doors
and
windows
owen
lay
awake
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
the
terror
of
the
future
made
rest
or
sleep
impossible
he
got
up
very
early
the
next
morning
long
before
it
was
light
and
after
lighting
the
fire
set
about
preparing
the
samples
he
had
mentioned
to
nora
but
found
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
do
much
in
this
direction
without
buying
more
cardboard
for
most
of
what
he
had
was
not
in
good
condition
they
had
bread
and
butter
and
tea
for
breakfast
frankie
had
his
in
bed
and
it
was
decided
to
keep
him
away
from
school
until
after
dinner
because
the
weather
was
so
very
cold
and
his
only
pair
of
boots
were
so
saturated
with
moisture
from
having
been
out
in
the
snow
the
previous
day
shall
make
a
few
inquiries
to
see
if
there
any
other
work
to
be
had
before
i
buy
the
cardboard
said
owen
i
afraid
not
much
use
just
as
he
was
preparing
to
go
out
the
front
door
bell
rang
and
as
he
was
going
down
to
answer
it
he
saw
bert
white
coming
upstairs
the
boy
was
carrying
a
flat
parcel
under
his
arm
corfin
plate
he
explained
as
he
arrived
at
the
door
at
once
misery
ses
you
can
do
it
at
an
i
got
to
wait
for
it
owen
and
his
wife
looked
at
each
other
with
intense
relief
so
he
was
not
to
be
dismissed
after
all
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
a
piece
of
paper
inside
the
parcel
with
the
name
of
the
party
what
dead
continued
bert
here
a
little
bottle
of
brunswick
black
for
you
to
do
the
inscription
with
he
send
any
other
message
he
told
me
to
tell
you
there
a
job
to
be
started
monday
morning
a
couple
of
rooms
to
be
done
out
somewhere
got
to
be
finished
by
thursday
and
there
another
job
wants
you
to
do
this
afternoon
after
dinner
so
you
got
to
come
to
the
yard
at
one
told
me
to
tell
you
meant
to
leave
a
message
for
you
yesterday
morning
but
forgot
did
he
say
to
you
about
the
fire
anything
they
both
of
came
about
an
hour
after
you
went
away
misery
and
the
bloke
too
but
they
did
kick
up
a
row
i
was
arf
frightened
i
can
tell
you
when
i
saw
both
coming
but
they
was
quite
nice
the
bloke
ses
to
me
ah
that
right
my
boy
ses
keep
up
a
good
fire
i
going
to
send
you
some
coke
ses
and
then
they
a
look
round
and
told
sawkins
to
put
some
new
panes
of
glass
where
the
winder
was
broken
and
you
know
that
great
big
what
was
under
the
truck
shed
told
sawkins
to
saw
it
up
and
cover
over
the
stone
floor
of
the
with
it
it
ai
all
right
there
now
cleared
out
all
the
muck
from
under
the
benches
and
we
got
two
sacks
of
coke
sent
from
the
and
the
bloke
told
me
when
that
all
used
up
i
got
to
get
a
order
orf
miss
wade
for
another
lot
at
one
owen
was
at
the
yard
where
he
saw
misery
who
instructed
him
to
go
to
the
front
shop
and
paint
some
numbers
on
the
racks
where
the
wallpapers
were
stored
whilst
he
was
doing
this
work
rushton
came
in
and
greeted
him
in
a
very
friendly
way
very
glad
you
let
me
know
about
the
boy
working
in
that
he
observed
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
can
assure
you
as
i
do
want
the
lad
to
be
uncomfortable
but
you
know
i
ca
attend
to
everything
myself
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
about
it
i
think
you
did
quite
right
i
should
have
done
the
same
myself
owen
did
not
know
what
to
reply
but
rushton
walked
off
without
waiting
chapter
a
far
far
better
thing
that
i
do
than
i
have
ever
although
owen
easton
and
crass
and
a
few
others
were
so
lucky
as
to
have
had
a
little
work
to
do
during
the
last
few
months
the
majority
of
their
fellow
workmen
had
been
altogether
out
of
employment
most
of
the
time
and
meanwhile
the
practical
and
the
pretended
disciples
of
christ
the
liars
and
hypocrites
who
professed
to
believe
that
all
men
are
brothers
and
god
their
father
had
continued
to
enact
the
usual
farce
that
they
called
with
the
misery
that
surrounded
them
on
every
side
they
continued
to
organize
and
sales
and
bazaars
and
to
distribute
their
rotten
clothes
and
boots
and
their
broken
victuals
and
soup
to
such
of
the
brethren
as
were
sufficiently
degraded
to
beg
for
them
the
beautiful
distress
committee
was
also
in
full
operation
over
a
thousand
brethren
had
registered
themselves
on
its
books
of
this
number
after
careful
investigation
the
committee
had
found
that
no
fewer
than
six
hundred
and
were
deserving
of
being
allowed
to
work
for
their
living
the
committee
would
probably
have
given
these
six
hundred
and
the
necessary
permission
but
it
was
somewhat
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
the
funds
at
its
disposal
were
only
sufficient
to
enable
that
number
of
brethren
to
be
employed
for
about
three
days
however
by
adopting
a
policy
of
temporizing
delay
and
general
artful
dodging
the
committee
managed
to
create
the
impression
that
they
were
dealing
with
the
problem
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
cunning
device
invented
by
brother
rushton
a
much
larger
number
of
the
brethren
would
have
succeeded
in
registering
themselves
as
unemployed
on
the
books
of
the
committee
in
previous
years
it
had
been
the
practice
to
issue
an
application
form
called
a
paper
to
any
brother
who
asked
for
one
and
the
brother
returned
it
after
filling
it
in
himself
at
a
secret
meeting
of
the
committee
rushton
proposed
amid
laughter
and
applause
it
was
such
a
good
joke
a
new
and
better
way
calculated
to
keep
down
the
number
of
applicants
the
result
of
this
innovation
was
that
no
more
forms
were
issued
but
the
applicants
for
work
were
admitted
into
the
office
one
at
a
time
and
were
there
examined
by
a
junior
clerk
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
french
juge
interrogating
a
criminal
the
clerk
filling
in
the
form
according
to
the
replies
of
the
culprit
your

do
you
think
you
would
be
fit
for
any
other
kind
you
any
references
and
so
on
and
so
forth
when
the
criminal
had
answered
all
the
questions
and
when
his
answers
had
all
been
duly
written
down
he
was
informed
that
a
member
of
the
committee
or
an
authorized
officer
or
some
other
person
would
in
due
course
visit
his
home
and
make
inquiries
about
him
after
which
the
authorized
officer
or
other
person
would
make
a
report
to
the
committee
who
would
consider
it
at
their
next
meeting
as
the
interrogation
of
each
criminal
occupied
about
half
an
hour
to
say
nothing
of
the
time
he
was
kept
waiting
it
will
be
seen
that
as
a
means
of
keeping
down
the
number
of
registered
unemployed
the
idea
worked
splendidly
when
rushton
introduced
this
new
rule
it
was
carried
unanimously
dr
weakling
being
the
only
dissentient
but
of
course
he
as
brother
grinder
remarked
was
always
opposed
to
any
sensible
proposal
there
was
one
consolation
however
grinder
added
they
was
not
likely
to
be
pestered
with
much
longer
the
first
of
november
was
coming
and
if
he
grinder
knowed
anything
of
working
men
they
was
sure
to
give
weakling
the
dirty
kick
out
directly
they
got
the
chance
a
few
days
afterwards
the
result
of
the
municipal
election
justified
brother
grinder
prognostications
for
the
working
men
voters
of
dr
weakling
ward
did
give
him
the
dirty
kick
out
but
rushton
didlum
grinder
and
several
other
members
of
the
band
were
triumphantly
returned
with
increased
majorities
mr
dauber
of
dauber
and
botchit
had
already
been
elected
a
guardian
of
the
poor
during
all
this
time
hunter
who
looked
more
worried
and
miserable
as
the
dreary
weeks
went
by
was
occupied
every
day
in
supervising
what
work
was
being
done
and
in
running
about
seeking
for
more
nearly
every
night
he
remained
at
the
office
until
a
late
hour
poring
over
specifications
and
making
out
estimates
the
police
had
become
so
accustomed
to
seeing
the
light
in
the
office
that
as
a
rule
they
took
no
notice
of
it
but
one
thursday
night
exactly
one
week
after
the
scene
between
owen
and
rushton
about
the
boy
the
constable
on
the
beat
observed
the
light
there
much
later
than
usual
at
first
he
paid
no
particular
attention
to
the
fact
but
when
night
merged
into
morning
and
the
light
still
remained
his
curiosity
was
aroused
he
knocked
at
the
door
but
no
one
came
in
answer
and
no
sound
disturbed
the
deathlike
stillness
that
reigned
within
the
door
was
locked
but
he
was
not
able
to
tell
whether
it
had
been
closed
from
the
inside
or
outside
because
it
had
a
spring
latch
the
office
window
was
low
down
but
it
was
not
possible
to
see
in
because
the
back
of
the
glass
had
been
painted
the
constable
thought
that
the
most
probable
explanation
of
the
mystery
was
that
whoever
had
been
there
earlier
in
the
evening
had
forgotten
to
turn
out
the
light
when
they
went
away
it
was
not
likely
that
thieves
or
anyone
who
had
no
business
to
be
there
would
advertise
their
presence
by
lighting
the
gas
he
made
a
note
of
the
incident
in
his
and
was
about
to
resume
his
beat
when
he
was
joined
by
his
inspector
the
latter
agreed
that
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
the
constable
was
probably
the
right
one
and
they
were
about
to
pass
on
when
the
inspector
noticed
a
small
speck
of
light
shining
through
the
lower
part
of
the
painted
window
where
a
small
piece
of
the
paint
had
either
been
scratched
or
had
shelled
off
the
glass
he
knelt
down
and
found
that
it
was
possible
to
get
a
view
of
the
interior
of
the
office
and
as
he
peered
through
he
gave
a
low
exclamation
when
he
made
way
for
his
subordinate
to
look
in
his
turn
the
constable
was
with
some
difficulty
able
to
distinguish
the
figure
of
a
man
lying
prone
upon
the
floor
it
was
an
easy
task
for
the
burly
policeman
to
force
open
the
office
door
a
single
push
of
his
shoulder
wrenched
it
from
its
fastenings
and
as
it
flew
back
the
socket
of
the
lock
fell
with
a
splash
into
a
great
pool
of
blood
that
had
accumulated
against
the
threshold
flowing
from
the
place
where
hunter
was
lying
on
his
back
his
arms
extended
and
his
head
nearly
severed
from
his
body
on
the
floor
close
to
his
right
hand
was
an
open
razor
an
overturned
chair
lay
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
table
where
he
usually
worked
the
table
itself
being
littered
with
papers
and
drenched
with
blood
within
the
next
few
days
crass
resumed
the
role
he
had
played
when
hunter
was
ill
during
the
summer
taking
charge
of
the
work
and
generally
doing
his
best
to
fill
the
dead
man
place
although
as
he
confided
to
certain
of
his
cronies
in
the
bar
of
the
cricketers
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
rushton
to
do
the
same
as
hunter
had
done
one
of
his
first
jobs
on
the
morning
after
the
discovery
of
the
body
was
to
go
with
mr
rushton
to
look
over
a
house
where
some
work
was
to
be
done
for
which
an
estimate
had
to
be
given
it
was
this
estimate
that
hunter
had
been
trying
to
make
out
the
previous
evening
in
the
office
for
they
found
that
the
papers
on
his
table
were
covered
with
figures
and
writing
relating
to
this
work
these
papers
justified
the
subsequent
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
that
hunter
committed
suicide
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
for
they
were
covered
with
a
lot
of
meaningless
scribbling
the
words
wrongly
spelt
and
having
no
intelligible
connection
with
each
other
there
was
one
sum
that
he
had
evidently
tried
repeatedly
to
do
correctly
but
which
came
wrong
in
a
different
way
every
time
the
fact
that
he
had
the
razor
in
his
possession
seemed
to
point
to
his
having
premeditated
the
act
but
this
was
accounted
for
at
the
inquest
by
the
evidence
of
the
last
person
who
saw
him
alive
a
hairdresser
who
stated
that
hunter
had
left
the
razor
with
him
to
be
sharpened
a
few
days
previously
and
that
he
had
called
for
it
on
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
he
had
ground
this
razor
for
mr
hunter
several
times
before
crass
took
charge
of
all
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
he
bought
a
new
pair
of
black
trousers
at
a
clothing
shop
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
discarded
his
own
silk
hat
which
was
getting
rather
shabby
in
favour
of
hunter
tall
one
which
he
found
in
the
office
and
annexed
without
hesitation
or
scruple
it
was
rather
large
for
him
but
he
put
some
folded
strips
of
paper
inside
the
leather
lining
crass
was
a
proud
man
as
he
walked
in
hunter
place
at
the
head
of
the
procession
trying
to
look
solemn
but
with
a
on
his
fat
pasty
face
destitute
of
colour
except
one
spot
on
his
chin
near
his
underlip
where
there
was
a
small
patch
of
inflammation
about
the
size
of
a
threepenny
piece
this
spot
had
been
there
for
a
very
long
time
at
first
as
well
as
he
could
remember
it
was
only
a
small
pimple
but
it
had
grown
larger
with
something
the
appearance
of
scurvy
crass
attributed
its
continuation
to
the
cold
having
into
it
last
winter
it
was
rather
strange
too
because
he
generally
took
care
of
himself
when
it
was
cold
he
always
wore
the
warm
wrap
that
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
old
lady
who
died
of
cancer
however
crass
did
not
worry
much
about
this
little
sore
place
he
just
put
a
little
zinc
ointment
on
it
occasionally
and
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
get
well
in
time
chapter
barrington
finds
a
situation
the
revulsion
of
feeling
that
barrington
experienced
during
the
progress
of
the
election
was
intensified
by
the
final
result
the
blind
stupid
enthusiastic
admiration
displayed
by
the
philanthropists
for
those
who
exploited
and
robbed
them
their
extraordinary
apathy
with
regard
to
their
own
interests
the
patient
way
in
which
they
endured
their
sufferings
tamely
submitting
to
live
in
poverty
in
the
midst
of
the
wealth
they
had
helped
to
create
their
callous
indifference
to
the
fate
of
their
children
and
the
savage
hatred
they
exhibited
towards
anyone
who
dared
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
better
things
forced
upon
him
the
thought
that
the
hopes
he
cherished
were
impossible
of
realization
the
words
of
the
renegade
socialist
recurred
constantly
to
his
mind
can
be
a
jesus
christ
if
you
like
but
for
my
part
i
finished
for
the
future
i
intend
to
look
after
myself
as
for
these
people
they
vote
for
what
they
want
they
get
what
they
vote
for
and
by
god
they
deserve
nothing
better
they
are
being
beaten
with
whips
of
their
own
choosing
and
if
i
had
my
way
they
should
be
chastised
with
scorpions
for
them
the
present
system
means
joyless
drudgery
rags
and
premature
death
and
they
vote
for
it
and
uphold
it
let
them
have
what
they
vote
for
let
them
drudge
and
let
them
starve
these
words
kept
ringing
in
his
ears
as
he
walked
through
the
crowded
streets
early
one
fine
evening
a
few
days
before
christmas
the
shops
were
all
brilliantly
lighted
for
the
display
of
their
christmas
stores
and
the
pavements
and
even
the
carriageways
were
thronged
with
sightseers
barrington
was
specially
interested
in
the
groups
of
shabbily
dressed
men
and
women
and
children
who
gathered
in
the
roadway
in
front
of
the
poulterers
and
butchers
shops
gazing
at
the
meat
and
the
serried
rows
of
turkeys
and
geese
decorated
with
coloured
ribbons
and
rosettes
he
knew
that
to
come
here
and
look
at
these
things
was
the
only
share
many
of
these
poor
people
would
have
of
them
and
he
marvelled
greatly
at
their
wonderful
patience
and
abject
resignation
but
what
struck
him
most
of
all
was
the
appearance
of
many
of
the
women
evidently
working
men
wives
their
faded
garments
and
the
tired
sad
expressions
on
their
pale
and
careworn
faces
some
of
them
were
alone
others
were
accompanied
by
little
children
who
trotted
along
trustfully
clinging
to
their
mothers
hands
the
sight
of
these
poor
little
ones
their
utter
helplessness
and
dependence
their
patched
unsightly
clothing
and
broken
boots
and
the
wistful
looks
on
their
pitiful
faces
as
they
gazed
into
the
windows
of
the
sent
a
pang
of
actual
physical
pain
to
his
heart
and
filled
his
eyes
with
tears
he
knew
that
these
children
naked
of
joy
and
all
that
makes
life
dear
were
being
tortured
by
the
sight
of
the
things
that
were
placed
so
cruelly
before
their
eyes
but
which
they
were
not
permitted
to
touch
or
to
share
and
like
joseph
of
old
his
heart
yearned
over
his
younger
brethren
he
felt
like
a
criminal
because
he
was
warmly
clad
and
well
fed
in
the
midst
of
all
this
want
and
unhappiness
and
he
flushed
with
shame
because
he
had
momentarily
faltered
in
his
devotion
to
the
noblest
cause
that
any
man
could
be
privileged
to
fight
for
the
uplifting
of
the
disconsolate
and
the
oppressed
he
presently
came
to
a
large
toy
shop
outside
which
several
children
were
standing
admiring
the
contents
of
the
window
he
recognized
some
of
these
children
and
paused
to
watch
them
and
to
listen
to
their
talk
they
did
not
notice
him
standing
behind
them
as
they
ranged
to
and
fro
before
the
window
and
as
he
looked
at
them
he
was
reminded
of
the
way
in
which
captive
animals
walk
up
and
down
behind
the
bars
of
their
cages
these
children
wandered
repeatedly
backwards
and
forwards
from
one
end
of
the
window
to
the
other
with
their
little
hands
pressed
against
the
impenetrable
plate
glass
choosing
and
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
particular
toys
that
took
their
fancies
mine
cried
charley
linden
enthusiastically
indicating
a
large
strongly
built
waggon
i
had
that
i
give
freddie
rides
in
it
and
bring
home
lots
of
firewood
and
we
could
play
at
fire
engines
as
well
rather
have
this
railway
said
frankie
owen
a
real
tunnel
and
real
coal
in
the
tenders
then
there
the
station
and
the
signals
and
a
place
to
turn
the
engine
round
and
a
red
lantern
to
light
when
there
danger
on
the
line
this
doll
not
the
biggest
one
the
one
in
pink
with
clothes
that
you
can
take
off
said
elsie
this
tea
set
and
this
needlecase
for
mother
little
freddie
had
let
go
his
hold
of
elsie
to
whom
he
usually
clung
tightly
and
was
clapping
his
hands
and
chuckling
with
delight
and
desire
he
cried
eagerly
pwetty
fweddy
want
it
no
use
lookin
at
them
any
longer
continued
elsie
with
a
sigh
as
she
took
hold
of
freddie
hand
to
lead
him
away
no
use
lookin
at
any
longer
the
likes
of
us
ca
expect
to
have
such
good
things
as
them
this
remark
served
to
recall
frankie
and
charley
to
the
stern
realities
of
life
and
turning
reluctantly
away
from
the
window
they
prepared
to
follow
elsie
but
freddie
had
not
yet
learnt
the
lesson
he
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
understand
that
the
good
things
of
the
world
were
not
for
the
likes
of
him
so
when
elsie
attempted
to
draw
him
away
he
pursed
up
his
underlip
and
began
to
cry
repeating
that
he
wanted
a
the
other
children
clustered
round
trying
to
coax
and
comfort
him
by
telling
him
that
no
one
was
allowed
to
have
anything
out
of
the
windows
yet
until
christmas
and
that
santa
claus
would
be
sure
to
bring
him
a
then
but
these
arguments
failed
to
make
any
impression
on
freddie
who
tearfully
insisted
upon
being
supplied
at
once
whilst
they
were
thus
occupied
they
caught
sight
of
barrington
whom
they
hailed
with
evident
pleasure
born
of
the
recollection
of
certain
gifts
of
pennies
and
cakes
they
had
at
different
times
received
from
him
mr
barrington
said
the
two
boys
in
a
breath
replied
barrington
as
he
patted
the
baby
cheek
the
matter
here
what
freddie
crying
for
wants
that
there
mister
the
one
with
the
real
on
said
charley
smiling
indulgently
like
a
person
who
realized
the
absurdity
of
the
demand
want
repeated
the
child
taking
hold
of
hand
and
returning
to
the
window
him
that
santa
claus
bring
it
to
him
on
christmas
whispered
elsie
he
believe
you
and
that
satisfy
him
and
sure
to
forget
all
about
it
in
a
little
while
you
still
out
of
work
mr
barrington
inquired
frankie
replied
barrington
slowly
got
something
to
do
at
last
that
a
good
job
ai
it
remarked
charley
said
barrington
whom
do
you
think
i
working
for
claus
claus
echoed
the
children
opening
their
eyes
to
the
fullest
extent
continued
barrington
solemnly
know
he
is
a
very
old
man
now
so
old
that
he
ca
do
all
his
work
himself
last
year
he
was
so
tired
that
he
was
able
to
get
round
to
all
the
children
he
wanted
to
give
things
to
and
consequently
a
great
many
of
them
never
got
anything
at
all
so
this
year
he
given
me
a
job
to
help
him
given
me
some
money
and
a
list
of
children
names
and
against
their
names
are
written
the
toys
they
are
to
have
my
work
is
to
buy
the
things
and
give
them
to
the
boys
and
girls
whose
names
are
on
the
list
the
children
listened
to
this
narrative
with
bated
breath
incredible
as
the
story
seemed
barrington
manner
was
so
earnest
as
to
almost
compel
belief
and
truly
or
are
you
only
having
a
game
said
frankie
at
length
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
elsie
and
charley
maintained
an
awestruck
silence
while
freddie
beat
upon
the
glass
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
truly
replied
barrington
unblushingly
as
he
took
out
his
and
turned
over
the
leaves
got
the
list
here
perhaps
your
names
are
down
for
something
the
three
children
turned
pale
and
their
hearts
beat
violently
as
they
listened
for
what
was
to
follow
me
see
continued
barrington
scanning
the
pages
of
the
book
yes
here
they
are
elsie
linden
one
doll
with
clothes
that
can
be
taken
off
one
one

freddie
easton

full
of
groceries
frankie

one
railway
with

station
train
with
real
coal
for

red
lamp
and
place
to
turn
the
engines
round
barrington
closed
the
book
you
may
as
well
have
your
things
now
he
continued
speaking
in
a
tone
buy
them
here
it
will
save
me
a
lot
of
work
i
shall
not
have
the
trouble
of
taking
them
round
to
where
you
live
it
lucky
i
happened
to
meet
you
it
the
children
were
breathless
with
emotion
but
they
just
managed
to
gasp
out
that
it
was
very
lucky
as
they
followed
him
into
the
shop
freddie
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
whose
condition
was
anything
like
normal
all
the
others
were
in
a
state
frankie
was
afraid
that
he
was
not
really
awake
at
all
it
could
be
true
it
must
be
a
dream
in
addition
to
the
hair
the
horse
was
furnished
with
four
wheels
they
did
not
have
it
made
into
a
parcel
but
tied
some
string
to
it
and
handed
it
over
to
its
new
owner
the
elder
children
were
scarcely
conscious
of
what
took
place
inside
the
shop
they
knew
that
barrington
was
talking
to
the
shopman
but
they
did
not
hear
what
was
said
the
sound
seemed
far
away
and
unreal
the
shopman
made
the
doll
the
and
the
needlecase
into
one
parcel
and
gave
it
to
elsie
the
railway
in
a
stout
cardboard
box
was
also
wrapped
up
in
brown
paper
and
frankie
heart
nearly
burst
when
the
man
put
the
package
into
his
arms
when
they
came
out
of
the
toy
shop
they
said
night
to
frankie
who
went
off
carrying
his
parcel
very
carefully
and
feeling
as
if
he
were
walking
on
air
the
others
went
into
a
provision
merchant
near
by
where
the
groceries
were
purchased
and
packed
into
the
waggon
then
barrington
upon
referring
to
the
list
to
make
quite
certain
that
he
had
not
forgotten
anything
found
that
santa
claus
had
put
down
a
pair
of
boots
each
for
elsie
and
charley
and
when
they
went
to
buy
these
it
was
seen
that
their
stockings
were
all
ragged
and
full
of
holes
so
they
went
to
a
draper
and
bought
some
stocking
also
barrington
said
that
although
they
were
not
on
the
list
he
was
sure
santa
claus
would
not
object
he
had
probably
meant
them
to
have
them
but
had
forgotten
to
put
them
down
chapter
the
end
the
following
evening
barrington
called
at
owen
place
he
said
he
was
going
home
for
the
holidays
and
had
come
to
say
goodbye
for
a
time
owen
had
not
been
doing
very
well
during
these
last
few
months
although
he
was
one
of
the
few
lucky
ones
who
had
had
some
small
share
of
work
most
of
the
money
he
earned
went
for
rent
to
pay
which
they
often
had
to
go
short
of
food
lately
his
chest
had
become
so
bad
that
the
slightest
exertion
brought
on
fits
of
coughing
and
breathlessness
which
made
it
almost
impossible
to
work
even
when
he
had
the
opportunity
often
it
was
only
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
of
will
that
he
was
able
to
continue
working
at
all
he
contrived
to
keep
up
appearances
to
a
certain
extent
before
rushton
who
although
he
knew
that
owen
was
not
so
strong
as
the
other
men
was
inclined
to
overlook
it
so
long
as
he
was
able
to
do
his
share
of
work
for
owen
was
a
very
useful
hand
when
things
were
busy
but
lately
some
of
the
men
with
whom
he
worked
began
to
manifest
dissatisfaction
at
having
him
for
a
mate
when
two
men
are
working
together
the
master
expects
to
see
two
men
work
done
and
if
one
of
the
two
is
not
able
to
do
his
share
it
makes
it
all
the
harder
for
the
other
he
never
had
the
money
to
go
to
a
doctor
to
get
advice
but
earlier
in
the
winter
he
had
obtained
from
rushton
a
ticket
for
the
local
hospital
every
saturday
throughout
the
year
when
the
men
were
paid
they
were
expected
to
put
a
penny
or
twopence
in
the
hospital
box
contributions
were
obtained
in
this
way
from
every
firm
and
workshop
in
the
town
the
masters
periodically
handed
these
boxes
over
to
the
hospital
authorities
and
received
in
return
some
tickets
which
they
gave
to
anyone
who
needed
and
asked
for
them
the
employer
had
to
fill
in
the
ticket
or
application
form
with
the
name
and
address
of
the
applicant
and
to
certify
that
in
his
opinion
the
individual
was
a
deserving
case
to
receive
this
charity
in
common
with
the
majority
of
workmen
owen
had
a
sort
of
horror
of
going
for
advice
to
this
hospital
but
he
was
so
ill
that
he
stifled
his
pride
and
went
it
happened
that
it
turned
out
to
be
more
expensive
than
going
to
a
private
doctor
for
he
had
to
be
at
the
hospital
at
a
certain
hour
on
a
particular
morning
to
do
this
he
had
to
stay
away
from
work
the
medicine
they
prescribed
and
which
he
had
to
buy
did
him
no
good
for
the
truth
was
that
it
was
not
medicine
that
he
like
thousands
of
others
needed
but
proper
conditions
of
life
and
proper
food
things
that
had
been
for
years
past
as
much
out
of
his
reach
as
if
he
had
been
dying
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
desert
occasionally
nora
contrived
by
going
without
some
other
necessary
to
buy
him
a
bottle
of
one
of
the
many
medicines
but
although
some
of
these
things
were
good
she
was
not
able
to
buy
enough
for
him
to
derive
any
benefit
from
them
although
he
was
often
seized
with
a
kind
of
terror
of
the
future
of
being
unable
to
work
he
fought
against
these
feelings
and
tried
to
believe
that
when
the
weather
became
warmer
he
would
be
all
right
once
more
when
barrington
came
in
owen
was
sitting
in
a
by
the
fire
in
the
he
had
been
to
work
that
day
with
harlow
washing
off
the
ceilings
and
stripping
the
old
paper
from
the
walls
of
two
rooms
in
rushton
home
and
he
looked
very
haggard
and
exhausted
have
never
told
you
before
said
barrington
after
they
had
been
talking
for
a
while
i
suppose
you
have
guessed
that
i
did
not
work
for
rushton
because
i
needed
to
do
so
in
order
to
live
i
just
wanted
to
see
things
for
myself
to
see
life
as
it
is
lived
by
the
majority
my
father
is
a
wealthy
man
he
does
approve
of
my
opinions
but
at
same
time
he
does
not
interfere
with
me
for
holding
them
and
i
have
a
fairly
liberal
allowance
which
i
spent
in
my
own
way
i
going
to
pass
christmas
with
my
own
people
but
in
the
spring
i
intend
to
fit
out
a
socialist
van
and
then
i
shall
come
back
here
we
have
some
of
the
best
speakers
in
the
movement
we
hold
meetings
every
night
we
drench
the
town
with
literature
and
start
a
branch
of
the
party
owen
eye
kindled
and
his
pale
face
flushed
shall
be
able
to
do
something
to
advertise
the
meetings
he
said
for
instance
i
could
paint
some
posters
and
placards
i
can
help
to
give
away
handbills
chimed
in
frankie
looking
up
from
the
floor
where
he
was
seated
working
the
railway
know
a
lot
of
boys
who
come
along
with
me
to
put
under
the
doors
as
well
they
were
in
the
and
the
door
was
shut
mrs
owen
was
in
the
next
room
with
ruth
while
the
two
men
were
talking
the
bell
was
heard
to
ring
and
frankie
ran
out
to
see
who
it
was
closing
the
door
after
him
barrington
and
owen
continued
their
conversation
and
from
time
to
time
they
could
hear
a
low
murmur
of
voices
from
the
adjoining
room
after
a
little
while
they
heard
some
one
go
out
by
the
front
door
and
almost
immediately
afterward
frankie
wild
with
excitement
burst
into
the
room
crying
out
and
mr
barrington
three
cheers
and
he
began
capering
gleefully
about
the
room
evidently
transported
with
joy
are
the
cheers
to
be
for
inquired
barrington
rather
mystified
by
this
extraordinary
conduct
easton
came
with
freddie
to
see
mrs
easton
and
she
gone
home
again
with
them
replied
freddie
she
given
the
baby
to
us
for
a
christmas
box
barrington
was
already
familiar
with
the
fact
of
easton
separation
from
his
wife
and
owen
now
told
him
the
story
of
their
reconciliation
barrington
took
his
leave
shortly
afterwards
his
train
left
at
eight
it
was
already
nearly
half
past
seven
and
he
said
he
had
a
letter
to
write
nora
brought
the
baby
in
to
show
him
before
he
went
and
then
she
helped
frankie
to
put
on
his
overcoat
for
barrington
had
requested
that
the
boy
might
be
permitted
to
go
a
little
way
with
him
there
was
a
stationer
shop
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
went
in
here
and
bought
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
an
envelope
and
having
borrowed
the
pen
and
ink
wrote
a
letter
which
he
enclosed
in
the
envelope
with
the
two
other
pieces
that
he
took
out
of
his
pocketbook
having
addressed
the
letter
he
came
out
of
the
shop
frankie
was
waiting
for
him
outside
he
gave
the
letter
to
the
boy
want
you
to
take
this
straight
home
and
give
it
to
your
dad
i
do
want
you
to
stop
to
play
or
even
to
speak
to
anyone
till
you
get
home
right
replied
frankie
wo
stop
running
all
the
way
barrington
hesitated
and
looked
at
his
watch
think
i
have
time
to
go
back
with
you
as
far
as
your
front
door
he
said
i
shall
be
quite
sure
you
have
lost
it
they
accordingly
retraced
their
steps
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
entrance
to
the
house
barrington
opened
the
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
watching
frankie
ascend
the
stairs
your
train
cross
over
the
bridge
inquired
the
boy
pausing
and
looking
over
the
banisters
why
we
can
see
the
bridge
from
our
window
and
if
you
were
to
wave
your
handkerchief
as
your
train
goes
over
the
bridge
we
could
wave
back
right
i
do
so
goodbye
barrington
waited
till
he
heard
frankie
open
and
close
the
door
of
owen
flat
and
then
he
hurried
away
when
he
gained
the
main
road
he
heard
the
sound
of
singing
and
saw
a
crowd
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
as
he
drew
near
he
perceived
that
it
was
a
religious
meeting
there
was
a
lighted
lamp
on
a
standard
in
the
centre
of
the
crowd
and
on
the
glass
of
this
lamp
was
painted
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
mr
rushton
was
preaching
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
he
said
that
they
had
come
hout
there
that
evening
to
tell
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
to
hall
those
dear
people
that
he
saw
standing
around
the
members
of
the
shining
light
chapel
to
which
he
himself
belonged
was
the
organizers
of
that
meeting
but
it
was
not
a
sectarian
meeting
for
he
was
to
say
that
several
members
of
other
denominations
was
there
with
them
in
the
good
work
as
he
continued
his
address
rushton
repeatedly
referred
to
the
individuals
who
composed
the
crowd
as
his
and
sisters
and
strange
to
say
nobody
laughed
barrington
looked
round
upon
the
mr
sweater
resplendent
in
a
new
silk
hat
of
the
latest
fashion
and
a
overcoat
the
rev
mr
bosher
vicar
of
the
church
of
the
whited
sepulchre
mr
grinder
one
of
the
churchwardens
at
the
same
place
of
alleged
worship
both
dressed
in
broadcloth
and
fine
linen
and
glossy
silk
hats
while
their
general
appearance
testified
to
the
fact
that
they
had
fared
sumptuously
for
many
days
mr
didlum
mrs
starvem
mr
dauber
mr
botchit
mr
smeeriton
and
mr
leavit
and
in
the
midst
was
the
rev
john
starr
doing
the
work
for
which
he
was
paid
as
he
stood
there
in
the
forefront
of
this
company
there
was
nothing
in
his
refined
and
comely
exterior
to
indicate
that
his
real
function
was
to
pander
to
and
flatter
them
to
invest
with
an
air
of
respectability
and
rectitude
the
abominably
selfish
lives
of
the
gang
of
swindlers
and
petty
tyrants
who
formed
the
majority
of
the
congregation
of
the
shining
light
chapel
he
was
doing
the
work
for
which
he
was
paid
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
there
condoning
and
justifying
the
crimes
of
these
typical
representatives
of
that
despicable
class
whose
greed
and
inhumanity
have
made
the
earth
into
a
hell
there
was
also
a
number
of
people
who
looked
as
if
they
could
do
with
a
good
meal
and
a
couple
of
shabbily
dressed
individuals
who
seemed
rather
out
of
place
in
the
glittering
throng
the
remainder
of
the
brothers
consisted
of
working
men
and
women
most
of
them
dressed
in
other
people
clothing
and
with
broken
leaky
boots
on
their
feet
rushton
having
concluded
his
address
didlum
stepped
forward
to
give
out
the
words
of
the
hymn
the
former
had
quoted
at
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
come
and
jine
this
band
and
hon
to
glory
go
strange
and
incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
the
reader
although
none
of
them
ever
did
any
of
the
things
jesus
said
the
people
who
were
conducting
this
meeting
had
the
effrontery
to
claim
to
be
followers
of
christ
christians
jesus
said
not
up
for
yourselves
treasure
upon
earth
not
the
world
nor
the
things
of
the
world
unto
you
that
are
rich
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
yet
all
these
of
christ
made
the
accumulation
of
money
the
principal
business
of
their
lives
jesus
said
ye
not
called
masters
for
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
men
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
touch
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
for
one
is
your
master
even
christ
and
ye
are
all
brethren
but
nearly
all
these
alleged
followers
of
the
humble
workman
of
nazareth
claimed
to
be
other
people
masters
or
mistresses
and
as
for
being
all
brethren
whilst
most
of
these
were
arrayed
in
broadcloth
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
they
knew
that
all
around
them
thousands
of
those
they
hypocritically
called
their
men
women
and
little
children
were
slowly
perishing
of
hunger
and
cold
and
we
have
already
seen
how
much
brotherhood
existed
between
sweater
and
rushton
and
the
miserable
wretches
in
their
employment
whenever
they
were
asked
why
they
did
not
practise
the
things
jesus
preached
they
replied
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
they
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
when
they
said
this
they
were
saying
in
effect
that
jesus
taught
an
impracticable
religion
and
they
appeared
to
forget
that
jesus
said
call
ye
me
lord
lord
when
ye
do
not
the
things
i
say
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
be
likened
to
a
foolish
man
who
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
but
although
none
of
these
of
christ
ever
did
the
things
that
jesus
said
they
talked
a
great
deal
about
them
and
sang
hymns
and
for
a
pretence
made
long
prayers
and
came
out
here
to
exhort
those
who
were
still
in
darkness
to
forsake
their
evil
ways
and
they
procured
this
lantern
and
wrote
a
text
upon
it
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
they
stigmatized
as
all
those
who
differed
from
them
forgetting
that
the
only
real
infidels
are
those
who
are
systematically
false
and
unfaithful
to
the
master
they
pretend
to
love
and
serve
grinder
having
a
slight
cold
had
not
spoken
this
evening
but
several
other
infidels
including
sweater
didlum
bosher
and
starr
had
addressed
the
meeting
making
a
special
appeal
to
the
working
people
of
whom
the
majority
of
the
crowd
was
composed
to
give
up
all
the
vain
pleasures
of
the
world
in
which
they
at
present
indulged
and
as
rushton
had
eloquently
put
it
at
the
close
of
his
remarks
and
jine
this
band
and
hon
to
glory
go
as
didlum
finished
reading
out
the
words
the
lady
at
the
harmonium
struck
up
the
tune
of
the
hymns
and
the
disciples
all
joined
in
the
singing
come
and
join
this
band
and
hon
to
glory
go
during
the
singing
certain
of
the
disciples
went
about
amongst
the
crowd
distributing
tracts
presently
one
of
them
offered
one
to
barrington
and
as
the
latter
looked
at
the
man
he
saw
that
it
was
slyme
who
also
recognized
him
at
the
same
instant
and
greeted
him
by
name
barrington
made
no
reply
except
to
decline
the
tract
do
want
that
from
you
he
said
contemptuously
slyme
turned
red
i
know
what
you
thinking
of
he
said
after
a
pause
and
speaking
in
an
injured
tone
you
should
judge
anyone
too
hard
it
was
only
my
fault
and
you
do
know
much
i
suffered
for
it
if
it
been
for
the
lord
i
believe
i
should
drownded
myself
barrington
made
no
answer
and
slyme
slunk
off
and
when
the
hymn
was
finished
brother
sweater
stood
forth
and
gave
all
those
present
a
hearty
invitation
to
attend
the
services
to
be
held
during
the
ensuing
week
at
the
chapel
of
the
shining
light
he
invited
them
there
specially
of
course
because
it
was
the
place
with
which
he
was
himself
connected
but
he
entreated
and
begged
of
them
even
if
they
would
not
come
there
to
go
somewhere
there
were
plenty
of
other
places
of
worship
in
the
town
in
fact
there
was
one
at
the
corner
of
nearly
every
street
those
who
did
not
fancy
the
services
at
the
shining
light
could
go
to
the
church
of
the
whited
sepulchre
but
he
really
did
hope
that
all
those
dear
people
whom
he
saw
standing
round
would
go
somewhere
a
short
prayer
from
bosher
closed
the
meeting
and
now
the
reason
for
the
presence
of
the
two
shabbily
dressed
disciples
was
made
manifest
for
while
the
better
dressed
and
therefore
more
respectable
brothers
were
shaking
hands
with
and
grinning
at
each
other
or
hovering
round
the
two
clergymen
and
mr
sweater
these
two
poor
wretches
carried
away
the
harmonium
and
the
lantern
together
with
the
hymn
books
and
what
remained
of
the
tracts
as
barrington
hurried
off
to
catch
the
train
one
of
the
gave
him
a
card
which
he
read
by
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
come
and
join
the
brotherhood
at
the
shining
light
chapel
psa
every
sunday
at
let
brotherly
love
continue
come
and
join
this
holy
band
and
on
to
glory
go
barrington
thought
he
would
rather
go
to
hell
if
there
were
such
a
place
with
some
decent
people
than
share
with
a
crew
like
this
nora
sat
sewing
by
the
fireside
in
the
front
room
with
the
baby
asleep
in
her
lap
owen
was
reclining
in
the
opposite
they
had
both
been
rather
silent
and
thoughtful
since
barrington
departure
it
was
mainly
by
their
efforts
that
the
reconciliation
between
easton
and
ruth
had
been
effected
and
they
had
been
so
desirous
of
accomplishing
that
result
that
they
had
not
given
much
thought
to
their
own
position
feel
that
i
could
not
bear
to
part
with
her
for
anything
now
said
nora
at
last
breaking
the
long
silence
frankie
is
so
fond
of
her
too
but
all
the
same
i
ca
feel
happy
about
it
when
i
think
how
ill
you
are
i
shall
be
all
right
when
the
weather
gets
a
little
warmer
said
owen
affecting
a
cheerfulness
he
did
not
feel
have
always
pulled
through
somehow
or
other
the
poor
little
thing
is
not
going
to
make
much
difference
and
she
be
as
well
off
with
us
as
she
would
have
been
if
ruth
had
not
gone
back
as
he
spoke
he
leaned
over
and
touched
the
hand
of
the
sleeping
child
and
the
little
fingers
closed
round
one
of
his
with
a
clutch
that
sent
a
thrill
all
through
him
as
he
looked
at
this
little
helpless
dependent
creature
he
realized
with
a
kind
of
thankfulness
that
he
would
never
have
the
heart
to
carry
out
the
dreadful
project
he
had
sometimes
entertained
in
hours
of
despondency
always
got
through
somehow
or
other
he
repeated
we
do
so
still
presently
they
heard
frankie
footsteps
ascending
the
stairs
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
boy
entered
the
room
have
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
wave
to
mr
barrington
when
his
train
goes
over
the
bridge
he
cried
breathlessly
he
sent
this
letter
open
the
window
quick
dad
or
it
may
be
too
late
plenty
of
time
yet
replied
owen
smiling
at
the
impetuosity
twenty
minutes
we
do
want
the
window
open
all
that
time
it
only
a
quarter
to
eight
by
our
clock
now
and
that
five
minutes
fast
however
so
as
to
make
quite
certain
that
the
train
should
not
run
past
unnoticed
frankie
pulled
up
the
blind
and
rubbing
the
steam
off
the
glass
took
up
his
station
at
the
window
to
watch
for
its
coming
while
owen
opened
the
letter
owen
you
will
find
two
one
for
ten
pounds
and
the
other
for
five
the
first
i
beg
you
will
accept
from
me
for
yourself
in
the
same
spirit
that
i
offer
it
and
as
i
would
accept
it
from
you
if
our
positions
were
reversed
if
i
were
in
need
i
know
that
you
would
willingly
share
with
me
whatever
you
had
and
i
could
not
hurt
you
by
refusing
the
other
note
i
want
you
to
change
tomorrow
morning
give
three
pounds
of
it
to
mrs
linden
and
the
remainder
to
bert
mother
you
all
a
happy
xmas
and
hoping
to
find
you
well
and
eager
for
the
fray
when
i
come
back
in
the
spring
for
the
cause
barrington
owen
read
it
over
two
or
three
times
before
he
could
properly
understand
it
and
then
without
a
word
of
comment
for
he
could
not
have
spoken
at
that
moment
to
save
his
life
he
passed
it
to
nora
who
felt
as
she
read
it
in
her
turn
as
if
a
great
burden
had
been
lifted
from
her
heart
all
the
undefined
terror
of
the
future
faded
away
as
she
thought
of
all
this
small
piece
of
paper
made
possible
meanwhile
frankie
at
the
window
was
straining
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
station
you
think
we
better
have
the
window
open
now
dad
he
said
at
last
as
the
clock
struck
eight
steam
keeps
coming
on
the
glass
as
fast
as
i
wipe
it
off
and
i
ca
see
out
properly
i
sure
nearly
time
now
our
clock
is
as
fast
as
you
think
it
is
right
we
have
it
open
now
so
as
to
be
on
the
safe
side
said
owen
as
he
stood
up
and
raised
the
sash
and
nora
having
wrapped
the
child
up
in
a
shawl
joined
them
at
the
window
ca
be
much
longer
now
you
know
said
frankie
clear
they
turned
the
red
light
off
the
signal
just
before
you
opened
the
window
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
heard
the
whistle
of
the
locomotive
as
it
drew
out
of
the
station
then
an
instant
before
the
engine
itself
came
into
sight
round
the
bend
the
brightly
polished
rails
were
illuminated
shining
like
burnished
gold
in
the
glare
of
its
headlight
a
few
seconds
afterwards
the
train
emerged
into
view
gathering
speed
as
it
came
along
the
short
stretch
of
straight
way
and
a
moment
later
it
thundered
across
the
bridge
it
was
too
far
away
to
recognize
his
face
but
they
saw
someone
looking
out
of
a
carriage
window
waving
a
handkerchief
and
they
knew
it
was
barrington
as
they
waved
theirs
in
return
soon
there
remained
nothing
visible
of
the
train
except
the
lights
at
the
rear
of
the
guard
van
and
presently
even
those
vanished
into
the
surrounding
darkness
the
lofty
window
at
which
they
were
standing
overlooked
several
of
the
adjacent
streets
and
a
great
part
of
the
town
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
were
several
empty
houses
bristling
with
different
house
advertisement
boards
and
bills
about
twenty
yards
away
the
shop
formerly
tenanted
by
mr
smallman
the
grocer
who
had
become
bankrupt
two
or
three
months
previously
was
also
plastered
with
similar
decorations
a
little
further
on
at
the
opposite
corner
were
the
premises
of
the
monopole
provision
stores
where
brilliant
lights
were
just
being
extinguished
for
they
like
most
of
the
other
shops
were
closing
their
premises
for
the
night
and
the
streets
took
on
a
more
cheerless
air
as
one
after
another
their
lights
disappeared
it
had
been
a
fine
day
and
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
the
moon
nearly
at
the
full
had
been
shining
in
a
clear
and
starry
sky
but
a
strong
wind
had
sprung
up
within
the
last
hour
the
weather
had
become
bitterly
cold
and
the
stars
were
rapidly
being
concealed
from
view
by
the
dense
banks
of
clouds
that
were
slowly
accumulating
overhead
as
they
remained
at
the
window
looking
out
over
this
scene
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
train
had
passed
out
of
sight
it
seemed
to
owen
that
the
gathering
darkness
was
as
a
curtain
that
concealed
from
view
the
infamy
existing
beyond
in
every
country
myriads
of
armed
men
waiting
for
their
masters
to
give
them
the
signal
to
fall
upon
and
rend
each
other
like
wild
beasts
all
around
was
a
state
of
dreadful
anarchy
abundant
riches
luxury
vice
hypocrisy
poverty
starvation
and
crime
men
literally
fighting
with
each
other
for
the
privilege
of
working
for
their
bread
and
little
children
crying
with
hunger
and
cold
and
slowly
perishing
of
want
the
gloomy
shadows
enshrouding
the
streets
concealing
for
the
time
their
grey
and
mournful
air
of
poverty
and
hidden
suffering
and
the
black
masses
of
cloud
gathering
so
menacingly
in
the
tempestuous
sky
seemed
typical
of
the
nemesis
which
was
overtaking
the
capitalist
system
that
atrocious
system
which
having
attained
to
the
fullest
measure
of
detestable
injustice
and
cruelty
was
now
fast
crumbling
into
ruin
inevitably
doomed
to
be
overwhelmed
because
it
was
all
so
wicked
and
abominable
inevitably
doomed
to
sink
under
the
blight
and
curse
of
senseless
and
unprofitable
selfishness
out
of
existence
for
ever
its
memory
universally
execrated
and
abhorred
but
from
these
ruins
was
surely
growing
the
glorious
fabric
of
the
commonwealth
mankind
awaking
from
the
long
night
of
bondage
and
mourning
and
arising
from
the
dust
wherein
they
had
lain
prone
so
long
were
at
last
looking
upward
to
the
light
that
was
riving
asunder
and
dissolving
the
dark
clouds
which
had
so
long
concealed
from
them
the
face
of
heaven
the
light
that
will
shine
upon
the
world
wide
fatherland
and
illumine
the
gilded
domes
and
glittering
pinnacles
of
the
beautiful
cities
of
the
future
where
men
shall
dwell
together
in
true
brotherhood
and
goodwill
and
joy
the
golden
light
that
will
be
diffused
throughout
all
the
happy
world
from
the
rays
of
the
risen
sun
of
socialism
appendix
mugsborough
mugsborough
was
a
town
of
about
eighty
thousand
inhabitants
about
two
hundred
miles
from
london
it
was
built
in
a
verdant
valley
looking
west
north
or
east
from
the
vicinity
of
the
fountain
on
the
grand
parade
in
the
centre
of
the
town
one
saw
a
succession
of
hills
to
the
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
stretched
a
vast
cultivated
plain
that
extended
to
the
south
coast
one
hundred
miles
away
the
climate
was
supposed
to
be
cool
in
summer
and
mild
in
winter
the
town
proper
nestled
in
the
valley
to
the
west
the
most
beautiful
and
sheltered
part
was
the
suburb
of
irene
here
were
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
residents
and
prosperous
tradespeople
and
numerous
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors
east
the
town
extended
up
the
slope
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
down
the
other
side
to
the
suburb
of
windley
where
the
majority
of
the
working
classes
lived
years
ago
when
the
facilities
for
foreign
travel
were
fewer
and
more
costly
mugsborough
was
a
favourite
resort
of
the
upper
classes
but
of
late
years
most
of
these
patriots
have
adopted
the
practice
of
going
on
the
continent
to
spend
the
money
they
obtain
from
the
working
people
of
england
however
mugsborough
still
retained
some
semblance
of
prosperity
summer
or
winter
the
place
was
usually
fairly
full
of
what
were
called
visitors
either
holidaymakers
or
invalids
the
grand
parade
was
generally
crowded
with
people
and
carriages
the
shops
appeared
to
be
and
at
the
time
of
our
story
an
air
of
prosperity
pervaded
the
town
but
this
fair
outward
appearance
was
deceitful
the
town
was
really
a
vast
whited
sepulchre
for
notwithstanding
the
natural
advantages
of
the
place
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
existed
in
a
state
of
perpetual
poverty
which
in
many
cases
bordered
on
destitution
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
was
that
a
great
part
of
the
incomes
of
the
tradespeople
and
and
about
a
third
of
the
wages
of
the
working
classes
were
paid
away
as
rent
and
rates
for
years
the
corporation
had
been
borrowing
money
for
necessary
public
works
and
improvements
and
as
the
indebtedness
of
the
town
increased
the
rates
rose
in
proportion
because
the
only
works
and
services
undertaken
by
the
council
were
such
as
did
not
yield
revenue
every
public
service
capable
of
returning
direct
profit
was
in
the
hands
of
private
companies
and
the
shares
of
the
private
companies
were
in
the
hands
of
the
members
of
the
corporation
and
the
members
of
the
corporation
were
in
the
hands
of
the
four
most
able
and
intellectual
of
their
number
councillors
sweater
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
each
of
whom
was
a
director
of
one
or
more
of
the
numerous
companies
which
battened
on
the
town
the
tramway
company
the
water
works
company
the
public
baths
company
the
winter
gardens
company
the
grand
hotel
company
and
numerous
others
there
was
however
one
company
in
which
sweater
rushton
didlum
and
grinder
had
no
shares
and
that
was
the
gas
company
the
oldest
and
most
flourishing
of
them
all
this
institution
had
grown
with
the
place
most
of
the
original
promoters
were
dead
and
the
greater
number
of
the
present
shareholders
were
although
they
lived
on
the
town
they
did
not
live
in
it
the
profits
made
by
this
company
were
so
great
that
being
prevented
by
law
from
paying
a
larger
dividend
than
ten
percent
they
frequently
found
it
a
difficult
matter
to
decide
what
to
do
with
the
money
they
paid
the
directors
and
principal
officials
themselves
shareholders
of
course
enormous
salaries
they
built
and
furnished
costly
and
luxurious
offices
and
gave
the
rest
to
the
shareholders
in
the
form
of
bonuses
there
was
one
way
in
which
the
company
might
have
used
some
of
the
profits
it
might
have
granted
shorter
hours
and
higher
wages
to
the
workmen
whose
health
was
destroyed
and
whose
lives
were
shortened
by
the
terrible
labour
of
the
and
the
limesheds
but
of
course
none
of
the
directors
or
shareholders
ever
thought
of
doing
that
it
was
not
the
business
of
the
company
to
concern
itself
about
them
years
ago
when
it
might
have
been
done
for
a
comparatively
small
amount
some
socialists
suggested
that
the
town
should
buy
the
gas
works
but
the
project
was
wrecked
by
the
inhabitants
upon
whom
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
socialist
had
the
same
effect
that
the
sight
of
a
red
rag
is
popularly
supposed
to
have
on
a
bull
of
course
even
now
it
was
still
possible
to
buy
out
the
company
but
it
was
supposed
that
it
would
cost
so
much
that
it
was
generally
considered
to
be
impracticable
although
they
declined
to
buy
the
gas
works
the
people
of
mugsborough
had
to
buy
the
gas
the
amount
paid
by
the
municipality
to
the
company
for
the
public
lighting
of
the
town
loomed
large
in
the
accounts
of
the
council
they
managed
to
get
some
of
their
own
back
by
imposing
a
duty
of
two
shillings
a
ton
upon
coals
imported
into
the
borough
but
although
it
cost
the
gas
works
a
lot
of
money
for
coal
dues
the
company
in
its
turn
got
its
own
back
by
increasing
the
price
of
gas
they
sold
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
