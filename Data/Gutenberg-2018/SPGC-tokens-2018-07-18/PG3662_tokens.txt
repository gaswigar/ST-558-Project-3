introduction
i
was
advised
on
all
hands
not
to
write
this
book
and
some
english
friends
who
have
read
it
urge
me
not
to
publish
it
you
will
be
accused
of
selecting
the
subject
they
say
because
sexual
viciousness
appeals
to
you
and
your
method
of
treatment
lays
you
open
to
attack
you
criticise
and
condemn
the
english
conception
of
justice
and
english
legal
methods
you
even
question
the
impartiality
of
english
judges
and
throw
an
unpleasant
light
on
english
juries
and
the
english
public
all
of
which
is
not
only
unpopular
but
will
convince
the
unthinking
that
you
are
a
presumptuous
or
at
least
an
outlandish
person
with
too
good
a
conceit
of
himself
and
altogether
too
free
a
tongue
i
should
be
more
than
human
or
less
if
these
arguments
did
not
give
me
pause
i
would
do
nothing
willingly
to
alienate
the
few
who
are
still
friendly
to
me
but
the
motives
driving
me
are
too
strong
for
such
personal
considerations
i
might
say
with
the
latin
non
me
tua
fervida
terrent
dicta
ferox
di
me
terrent
et
jupiter
hostis
even
this
would
be
only
a
part
of
the
truth
youth
it
seems
to
me
should
always
be
prudent
for
youth
has
much
to
lose
but
i
am
come
to
that
time
of
life
when
a
man
can
afford
to
be
bold
may
even
dare
to
be
himself
and
write
the
best
in
him
heedless
of
knaves
and
fools
or
of
anything
this
world
may
do
the
voyage
for
me
is
almost
over
i
am
in
sight
of
port
like
a
good
shipman
i
have
already
sent
down
the
lofty
spars
and
housed
the
captious
canvas
in
preparation
for
the
long
anchorage
i
have
little
now
to
fear
and
the
immortals
are
with
me
in
my
design
greek
tragedy
treated
of
far
more
horrible
and
revolting
themes
such
as
the
banquet
of
thyestes
and
dante
did
not
shrink
from
describing
the
unnatural
meal
of
ugolino
the
best
modern
critics
approve
my
choice
all
depends
on
the
subject
says
matthew
arnold
talking
of
great
literature
choose
a
fitting
action
a
great
and
significant
action
penetrate
yourself
with
the
feeling
of
the
situation
this
done
everything
else
will
follow
for
expression
is
subordinate
and
secondary
socrates
was
found
guilty
of
corrupting
the
young
and
was
put
to
death
for
the
offence
his
accusation
and
punishment
constitute
surely
a
great
and
significant
action
such
as
matthew
arnold
declared
was
alone
of
the
highest
and
most
permanent
literary
value
the
action
involved
in
the
rise
and
ruin
of
oscar
wilde
is
of
the
same
kind
and
of
enduring
interest
to
humanity
critics
may
say
that
wilde
is
a
smaller
person
than
socrates
less
significant
in
many
ways
but
even
if
this
were
true
it
would
not
alter
the
artist
position
the
great
portraits
of
the
world
are
not
of
napoleon
or
dante
the
differences
between
men
are
not
important
in
comparison
with
their
inherent
likeness
to
depict
the
mortal
so
that
he
takes
on
immortality
that
is
the
task
of
the
artist
there
are
special
reasons
too
why
i
should
handle
this
story
oscar
wilde
was
a
friend
of
mine
for
many
years
i
could
not
help
prizing
him
to
the
very
end
he
was
always
to
me
a
charming
influence
he
was
dreadfully
punished
by
men
utterly
his
inferiors
ruined
outlawed
persecuted
till
death
itself
came
as
a
deliverance
his
sentence
impeaches
his
judges
the
whole
story
is
charged
with
tragic
pathos
and
unforgettable
lessons
i
have
waited
for
more
than
ten
years
hoping
that
some
one
would
write
about
him
in
this
spirit
and
leave
me
free
to
do
other
things
but
nothing
such
as
i
propose
has
yet
appeared
oscar
wilde
was
greater
as
a
talker
in
my
opinion
than
as
a
writer
and
no
fame
is
more
quickly
evanescent
if
i
do
not
tell
his
story
and
paint
his
portrait
it
seems
unlikely
that
anyone
else
will
do
it
english
strachery
may
accuse
me
of
attacking
morality
the
accusation
is
worse
than
absurd
the
very
foundations
of
this
old
world
are
moral
the
charred
ember
itself
floats
about
in
space
moves
and
has
its
being
in
obedience
to
inexorable
law
the
thinker
may
define
morality
the
reformer
may
try
to
bring
our
notions
of
it
into
nearer
accord
with
the
fact
human
love
and
pity
may
seek
to
soften
its
occasional
injustices
and
mitigate
its
intolerable
harshness
but
that
is
all
the
freedom
we
mortals
enjoy
all
the
allotted
to
us
in
this
book
the
reader
will
find
the
figure
of
the
clamped
so
to
speak
with
bands
of
steel
to
the
huge
granitic
cliff
of
english
puritanism
no
account
was
taken
of
his
manifold
virtues
and
graces
no
credit
given
him
for
his
extraordinary
achievements
he
was
hounded
out
of
life
because
his
sins
were
not
the
sins
of
the
english
the
culprit
was
in
much
nobler
and
better
than
his
judges
here
are
all
the
elements
of
pity
and
sorrow
and
fear
that
are
required
in
great
tragedy
the
artist
who
finds
in
oscar
wilde
a
great
and
provocative
subject
for
his
art
needs
no
argument
to
justify
his
choice
if
the
picture
is
a
great
and
living
portrait
the
moralist
will
be
satisfied
the
dark
shadows
must
all
be
there
as
well
as
the
high
lights
and
the
effect
must
be
to
increase
our
tolerance
and
intensify
our
pity
if
on
the
other
hand
the
portrait
is
or
all
the
reasoning
in
the
world
and
the
praise
of
all
the
sycophants
will
not
save
the
picture
from
contempt
and
the
artist
from
censure
there
is
one
measure
by
which
intention
as
apart
from
accomplishment
can
be
judged
and
one
only
if
you
think
the
book
well
done
says
pascal
and
on
find
it
strong
be
assured
that
the
man
who
wrote
it
wrote
it
on
his
knees
no
book
could
have
been
written
more
reverently
than
this
book
of
mine
nice
frank
harris
chapter
i
oscar
father
and
mother
on
trial
on
the
of
december
dublin
society
was
abuzz
with
excitement
a
tidbit
of
scandal
which
had
long
been
rolled
on
the
tongue
in
was
to
be
discussed
in
open
court
and
all
women
and
a
good
many
men
were
agog
with
curiosity
and
expectation
the
story
itself
was
highly
spiced
and
all
the
actors
in
it
well
known
a
famous
doctor
and
oculist
recently
knighted
for
his
achievements
was
the
real
defendant
he
was
married
to
a
woman
with
a
great
literary
reputation
as
a
poet
and
writer
who
was
idolized
by
the
populace
for
her
passionate
advocacy
of
ireland
claim
to
speranza
was
regarded
by
the
irish
people
as
a
sort
of
irish
muse
the
young
lady
bringing
the
action
was
the
daughter
of
the
professor
of
medical
jurisprudence
at
trinity
college
who
was
also
the
chief
at
marsh
library
it
was
said
that
this
miss
travers
a
pretty
girl
just
out
of
her
teens
had
been
seduced
by
sir
william
wilde
while
under
his
care
as
a
patient
some
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
chloroform
had
been
used
and
that
the
girl
had
been
violated
the
doctor
was
represented
as
a
sort
of
minotaur
lustful
stories
were
invented
and
repeated
with
breathless
delight
on
all
faces
the
joy
of
malicious
curiosity
and
envious
denigration
the
interest
taken
in
the
case
was
extraordinary
the
excitement
beyond
comparison
the
first
talents
of
the
bar
were
engaged
on
both
sides
serjeant
armstrong
led
for
the
plaintiff
helped
by
the
famous
mr
butt
and
heron
who
were
in
turn
backed
by
hamill
and
quinn
while
serjeant
sullivan
was
for
the
defendant
supported
by
sidney
and
morris
and
aided
by
john
curran
and
purcell
the
court
of
common
pleas
was
the
stage
chief
justice
monahan
presiding
with
a
special
jury
the
trial
was
expected
to
last
a
week
and
not
only
the
court
but
the
approaches
to
it
were
crowded
to
judge
by
the
scandalous
reports
the
case
should
have
been
a
criminal
case
should
have
been
conducted
by
the
against
sir
william
wilde
but
that
was
not
the
way
it
presented
itself
the
action
was
not
even
brought
directly
by
miss
travers
or
by
her
father
travers
against
sir
william
wilde
for
rape
or
criminal
assault
or
seduction
it
was
a
civil
action
brought
by
miss
travers
who
claimed
damages
for
a
libel
written
by
lady
wilde
to
her
father
travers
the
letter
complained
of
ran
as
follows
tower
bray
may
sir
you
may
not
be
aware
of
the
disreputable
conduct
of
your
daughter
at
bray
where
she
consorts
with
all
the
low
newspaper
boys
in
the
place
employing
them
to
disseminate
offensive
placards
in
which
my
name
is
given
and
also
tracts
in
which
she
makes
it
appear
that
she
has
had
an
intrigue
with
sir
william
wilde
if
she
chooses
to
disgrace
herself
it
is
not
my
affair
but
as
her
object
in
insulting
me
is
in
the
hope
of
extorting
money
for
which
she
has
several
times
applied
to
sir
william
wilde
with
threats
of
more
annoyance
if
not
given
i
think
it
right
to
inform
you
as
no
threat
of
additional
insult
shall
ever
extort
money
from
our
hands
the
wages
of
disgrace
she
has
so
basely
treated
for
and
demanded
shall
never
be
given
her
jane
wilde
to
travers
the
summons
and
plaint
charged
that
this
letter
written
to
the
father
of
the
plaintiff
by
lady
wilde
was
a
libel
reflecting
on
the
character
and
chastity
of
miss
travers
and
as
lady
wilde
was
a
married
woman
her
husband
sir
william
wilde
was
joined
in
the
action
as
a
for
conformity
the
defences
set
up
were
first
a
plea
of
no
libel
secondly
that
the
letter
did
not
bear
the
defamatory
sense
imputed
by
the
plaint
thirdly
a
denial
of
the
publication
and
fourthly
a
plea
of
privilege
this
last
was
evidently
the
real
defence
and
was
grounded
upon
facts
which
afforded
some
justification
of
lady
bitter
letter
it
was
admitted
that
for
a
year
or
more
miss
travers
had
done
her
uttermost
to
annoy
both
sir
william
wilde
and
his
wife
in
every
possible
way
the
trouble
began
the
defence
stated
by
miss
travers
fancying
that
she
was
slighted
by
lady
wilde
she
thereupon
published
a
scandalous
pamphlet
under
the
title
of
florence
boyle
price
a
warning
by
speranza
with
the
evident
intention
of
causing
the
public
to
believe
that
the
booklet
was
the
composition
of
lady
wilde
under
the
assumed
name
of
florence
boyle
price
in
this
pamphlet
miss
travers
asserted
that
a
person
she
called
quilp
had
made
an
attempt
on
her
virtue
she
put
the
charge
mildly
it
is
sad
she
wrote
to
think
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
lady
must
not
venture
into
a
study
without
being
accompanied
by
a
bodyguard
to
protect
her
miss
travers
admitted
that
quilp
was
intended
for
sir
william
wilde
indeed
she
identified
quilp
with
the
newly
made
knight
in
a
dozen
different
ways
she
went
so
far
as
to
describe
his
appearance
she
declared
that
he
had
an
animal
sinister
expression
about
his
mouth
which
was
coarse
and
vulgar
in
the
extreme
the
large
protruding
under
lip
was
most
unpleasant
nor
did
the
upper
part
of
his
face
redeem
the
lower
part
his
eyes
were
small
and
round
mean
and
prying
in
expression
there
was
no
candour
in
the
doctor
countenance
where
one
looked
for
candour
quilp
quarrel
with
his
victim
it
appeared
was
that
she
was
unnaturally
passionless
the
publication
of
such
a
pamphlet
was
calculated
to
injure
both
sir
william
and
lady
wilde
in
public
esteem
and
miss
travers
was
not
content
to
let
the
matter
rest
there
she
drew
attention
to
the
pamphlet
by
letters
to
the
papers
and
on
one
occasion
when
sir
william
wilde
was
giving
a
lecture
to
the
young
men
christian
association
at
the
metropolitan
hall
she
caused
large
placards
to
be
exhibited
in
the
neighbourhood
having
upon
them
in
large
letters
the
words
sir
william
wilde
and
speranza
she
employed
one
of
the
persons
bearing
a
placard
to
go
about
ringing
a
large
hand
bell
which
she
herself
had
given
to
him
for
the
purpose
she
even
published
doggerel
verses
in
the
dublin
weekly
advertiser
and
signed
them
speranza
which
annoyed
lady
wilde
intensely
one
read
thus
your
progeny
is
quite
a
pest
to
those
who
hate
such
critters
some
sport
i
have
or
i
blest
i
fry
the
wilde
breed
in
the
west
then
you
can
call
them
fritters
she
wrote
letters
to
saunders
newsletter
and
even
reviewed
a
book
of
lady
wilde
entitled
the
first
temptation
and
called
it
a
blasphemous
production
moreover
when
lady
wilde
was
staying
at
bray
miss
travers
sent
boys
to
offer
the
pamphlet
for
sale
to
the
servants
in
her
house
in
fine
miss
travers
showed
a
keen
feminine
ingenuity
and
pertinacity
in
persecution
worthy
of
a
nobler
motive
but
the
defence
did
not
rely
on
such
annoyance
as
sufficient
provocation
for
lady
wilde
libellous
letter
the
plea
went
on
to
state
that
miss
travers
had
applied
to
sir
william
wilde
for
money
again
and
again
and
accompanied
these
applications
with
threats
of
worse
if
the
requests
were
not
acceded
to
it
was
under
these
circumstances
according
to
lady
wilde
that
she
wrote
the
letter
complained
of
to
travers
and
enclosed
it
in
a
sealed
envelope
she
wished
to
get
travers
to
use
his
parental
influence
to
stop
miss
travers
from
further
disgracing
herself
and
insulting
and
annoying
sir
william
and
lady
wilde
the
defence
carried
the
war
into
the
enemy
camp
by
thus
suggesting
that
miss
travers
was
blackmailing
sir
william
and
lady
wilde
the
attack
in
the
hands
of
serjeant
armstrong
was
still
more
deadly
and
convincing
he
rose
early
on
the
monday
afternoon
and
declared
at
the
beginning
that
the
case
was
so
painful
at
the
beginning
that
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
have
been
engaged
in
it
a
hypocritical
statement
which
deceived
no
one
and
was
just
as
as
his
wig
but
with
this
exception
the
story
he
told
was
extraordinarily
clear
and
gripping
some
ten
years
before
miss
travers
then
a
young
girl
of
nineteen
was
suffering
from
partial
deafness
and
was
recommended
by
her
own
doctor
to
go
to
wilde
who
was
the
chief
oculist
and
aurist
in
dublin
miss
travers
went
to
wilde
who
treated
her
successfully
wilde
would
accept
no
fees
from
her
stating
at
the
outset
that
as
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
he
thought
it
an
honour
to
be
of
use
to
her
serjeant
armstrong
assured
his
hearers
that
in
spite
of
miss
travers
beauty
he
believed
that
at
first
wilde
took
nothing
but
a
benevolent
interest
in
the
girl
even
when
his
professional
services
ceased
to
be
necessary
wilde
continued
his
friendship
he
wrote
miss
travers
innumerable
letters
he
advised
her
as
to
her
reading
and
sent
her
books
and
tickets
for
places
of
amusement
he
even
insisted
that
she
should
be
better
dressed
and
pressed
money
upon
her
to
buy
bonnets
and
clothes
and
frequently
invited
her
to
his
house
for
dinners
and
parties
the
friendship
went
on
in
this
sentimental
kindly
way
for
some
five
or
six
years
till
the
wily
serjeant
knew
enough
about
human
nature
to
feel
that
it
was
necessary
to
discover
some
dramatic
incident
to
change
benevolent
sympathy
into
passion
and
he
certainly
found
what
he
wanted
miss
travers
it
appeared
had
been
burnt
low
down
on
her
neck
when
a
child
the
cicatrice
could
still
be
seen
though
it
was
gradually
disappearing
when
her
ears
were
being
examined
by
wilde
it
was
customary
for
her
to
kneel
on
a
hassock
before
him
and
he
thus
discovered
this
burn
on
her
neck
after
her
hearing
improved
he
still
continued
to
examine
the
cicatrice
from
time
to
time
pretending
to
note
the
speed
with
which
it
was
disappearing
some
time
in
or
miss
travers
had
a
corn
on
the
sole
of
her
foot
which
gave
her
some
pain
wilde
did
her
the
honour
of
paring
the
corn
with
his
own
hands
and
painting
it
with
iodine
the
cunning
serjeant
could
not
help
saying
with
some
confusion
natural
or
assumed
that
it
would
have
been
just
as
well
at
least
there
are
men
of
such
temperament
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
have
such
a
manipulation
going
on
the
spectators
in
the
court
smiled
feeling
that
in
manipulation
the
serjeant
had
found
the
most
neatly
suggestive
word
naturally
at
this
point
serjeant
sullivan
interfered
in
order
to
stem
the
rising
tide
of
interest
and
to
blunt
the
point
of
the
accusation
sir
william
wilde
he
said
was
not
the
man
to
shrink
from
any
investigation
but
he
was
only
in
the
case
formally
and
he
could
not
meet
the
allegations
which
therefore
were
and
unfair
and
so
forth
and
so
on
after
the
necessary
pause
serjeant
armstrong
plucked
his
wig
straight
and
proceeded
to
read
letters
of
wilde
to
miss
travers
at
this
time
in
which
he
tells
her
not
to
put
too
much
iodine
on
her
foot
but
to
rest
it
for
a
few
days
in
a
slipper
and
keep
it
in
a
horizontal
position
while
reading
a
pleasant
book
if
she
would
send
in
he
would
try
and
send
her
one
i
have
now
concluded
the
serjeant
like
an
actor
carefully
preparing
his
effect
traced
this
friendly
intimacy
down
to
a
point
where
it
begins
to
be
dangerous
i
do
not
wish
to
aggravate
the
gravity
of
the
charge
in
the
slightest
by
any
rhetoric
or
by
an
unconscious
overstatement
you
shall
therefore
gentlemen
of
the
jury
hear
from
miss
travers
herself
what
took
place
between
her
and
wilde
and
what
she
complains
of
miss
travers
then
went
into
the
though
thin
and
past
her
first
youth
she
was
still
pretty
in
a
conventional
way
with
regular
features
and
dark
eyes
she
was
examined
by
mr
butt
after
confirming
point
by
point
what
serjeant
armstrong
had
said
she
went
on
to
tell
the
jury
that
in
the
summer
of
she
had
thought
of
going
to
australia
where
her
two
brothers
lived
who
wanted
her
to
come
out
to
them
wilde
lent
her
to
go
but
told
her
she
must
say
it
was
or
her
father
might
think
the
sum
too
large
she
missed
the
ship
in
london
and
came
back
she
was
anxious
to
impress
on
the
jury
the
fact
that
she
had
repaid
wilde
that
she
had
always
repaid
whatever
he
had
lent
her
she
went
on
to
relate
how
one
day
wilde
had
got
her
in
a
kneeling
position
at
his
feet
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
declaring
that
he
would
not
let
her
go
until
she
called
him
william
miss
travers
refused
to
do
this
and
took
umbrage
at
the
embracing
and
ceased
to
visit
at
his
house
but
wilde
protested
extravagantly
that
he
had
meant
nothing
wrong
and
begged
her
to
forgive
him
and
gradually
brought
about
a
reconciliation
which
was
consummated
by
pressing
invitations
to
parties
and
by
a
loan
of
two
or
three
pounds
for
a
dress
which
loan
like
the
others
had
been
carefully
repaid
the
excitement
in
the
court
was
becoming
breathless
it
was
felt
that
the
details
were
cumulative
the
doctor
was
besieging
the
fortress
in
proper
form
the
story
of
embracings
reconciliations
and
loans
all
prepared
the
public
for
the
great
scene
the
girl
went
on
now
answering
questions
now
telling
bits
of
the
story
in
her
own
way
mr
butt
the
great
advocate
taking
care
that
it
should
all
be
consecutive
and
clear
with
a
due
crescendo
of
interest
in
october
it
appeared
lady
wilde
was
not
in
the
house
at
merrion
square
but
was
away
at
bray
as
one
of
the
children
had
not
been
well
and
she
thought
the
sea
air
would
benefit
him
wilde
was
alone
in
the
house
miss
travers
called
and
was
admitted
into
wilde
study
he
put
her
on
her
knees
before
him
and
bared
her
neck
pretending
to
examine
the
burn
he
fondled
her
too
much
and
pressed
her
to
him
she
took
offence
and
tried
to
draw
away
somehow
or
other
his
hand
got
entangled
in
a
chain
at
her
neck
she
called
out
to
him
you
are
suffocating
me
and
tried
to
rise
but
he
cried
out
like
a
madman
i
will
i
want
to
and
pressed
what
seemed
to
be
a
handkerchief
over
her
face
she
declared
that
she
lost
consciousness
when
she
came
to
herself
she
found
wilde
frantically
imploring
her
to
come
to
her
senses
while
dabbing
water
on
her
face
and
offering
her
wine
to
drink
if
you
do
drink
he
cried
i
pour
it
over
you
for
some
time
she
said
she
scarcely
realized
where
she
was
or
what
had
occurred
though
she
heard
him
talking
but
gradually
consciousness
came
back
to
her
and
though
she
would
not
open
her
eyes
she
understood
what
he
was
saying
he
talked
frantically
do
be
reasonable
and
all
will
be
right
i
am
in
your
power
spare
me
oh
spare
me
strike
me
if
you
like
i
wish
to
god
i
could
hate
you
but
i
ca
i
swore
i
would
never
touch
your
hand
again
attend
to
me
and
do
what
i
tell
you
have
faith
and
confidence
in
me
and
you
may
remedy
the
past
and
go
to
australia
think
of
the
talk
this
may
give
rise
to
keep
up
appearances
for
your
own
sake
he
then
took
her
to
a
bedroom
and
made
her
drink
some
wine
and
lie
down
for
some
time
she
afterwards
left
the
house
she
hardly
knew
how
he
accompanied
her
to
the
door
she
thought
but
could
not
be
certain
she
was
half
dazed
the
judge
here
interposed
with
the
crucial
question
did
you
know
that
you
had
been
violated
the
audience
waited
breathlessly
after
a
short
pause
miss
travers
replied
yes
then
it
was
true
the
worst
was
true
the
audience
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
caught
breath
with
malevolent
delight
but
the
thrills
were
not
exhausted
miss
travers
next
told
how
in
wilde
study
one
evening
she
had
been
vexed
at
some
slight
and
at
once
took
four
pennyworth
of
laudanum
which
she
had
bought
wilde
hurried
her
round
to
the
house
of
walsh
a
physician
in
the
neighbourhood
who
gave
her
an
antidote
wilde
was
dreadfully
frightened
lest
something
should
get
out
she
admitted
at
once
that
she
had
sometimes
asked
wilde
for
money
she
thought
nothing
of
it
as
she
had
again
and
again
repaid
him
the
monies
which
he
had
lent
her
miss
travers
examination
in
chief
had
been
intensely
interesting
the
fashionable
ladies
had
heard
all
they
had
hoped
to
hear
and
it
was
noticed
that
they
were
not
so
eager
to
get
seats
in
the
court
from
this
time
on
though
the
room
was
still
crowded
the
of
miss
travers
was
at
least
as
interesting
to
the
student
of
human
nature
as
the
examination
in
chief
had
been
for
in
her
story
of
what
took
place
on
that
of
october
weaknesses
and
discrepancies
of
memory
were
discovered
and
at
length
improbabilities
and
contradictions
in
the
narrative
itself
first
of
all
it
was
elicited
that
she
could
not
be
certain
of
the
day
it
might
have
been
the
or
the
it
was
friday
the
she
thought
it
was
a
great
event
to
her
the
most
awful
event
in
her
whole
life
yet
she
could
not
remember
the
day
for
certain
did
you
tell
anyone
of
what
had
taken
place
no
not
even
your
father
no
why
not
i
did
not
wish
to
give
him
pain
but
you
went
back
to
wilde
study
after
the
awful
assault
yes
you
went
again
and
again
did
you
not
yes
did
he
ever
attempt
to
repeat
the
offence
yes
the
audience
was
thunderstruck
the
plot
was
deepening
miss
travers
went
on
to
say
that
the
doctor
was
rude
to
her
again
she
did
not
know
his
intention
he
took
hold
of
her
and
tried
to
fondle
her
but
she
would
not
have
it
after
the
second
offence
you
went
back
yes
did
he
ever
repeat
it
again
yes
miss
travers
said
that
once
again
wilde
had
been
rude
to
her
yet
you
returned
again
yes
and
you
took
money
from
this
man
who
had
violated
you
against
your
will
yes
you
asked
him
for
money
yes
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
told
about
this
second
and
third
assault
is
it
not
yes
the
witness
admitted
so
far
all
that
miss
travers
had
said
hung
together
and
seemed
eminently
credible
but
when
she
was
questioned
about
the
chloroform
and
the
handkerchief
she
became
confused
at
the
outset
she
admitted
that
the
handkerchief
might
have
been
a
rag
she
was
not
certain
it
was
a
rag
it
was
something
she
saw
the
doctor
throw
into
the
fire
when
she
came
to
her
senses
had
he
kept
it
in
his
hands
then
all
the
time
you
were
unconscious
i
do
know
just
to
show
it
to
you
the
witness
was
silent
when
she
was
examined
as
to
her
knowledge
of
chloroform
she
broke
down
hopelessly
she
did
not
know
the
smell
of
it
could
not
describe
it
did
not
know
whether
it
burnt
or
not
could
not
in
fact
swear
that
it
was
chloroform
wilde
had
used
would
not
swear
that
it
was
anything
believed
that
it
was
chloroform
or
something
like
it
because
she
lost
consciousness
that
was
her
only
reason
for
saying
that
chloroform
had
been
given
to
her
again
the
judge
interposed
with
the
probing
question
did
you
say
anything
about
chloroform
in
your
pamphlet
no
the
witness
murmured
it
was
manifest
that
the
strong
current
of
feeling
in
favour
of
miss
travers
had
begun
to
ebb
the
story
was
a
toothsome
morsel
still
but
it
was
regretfully
admitted
that
the
charge
of
rape
had
not
been
pushed
home
it
was
felt
to
be
disappointing
too
that
the
chief
prosecuting
witness
should
have
damaged
her
own
case
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
defence
and
some
thought
the
pendulum
might
swing
back
again
lady
wilde
gave
her
evidence
emphatically
but
was
too
bitter
to
be
a
persuasive
witness
it
was
tried
to
prove
from
her
letter
that
she
believed
that
miss
travers
had
had
an
intrigue
with
sir
william
wilde
but
she
would
not
have
it
she
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
in
her
husband
guilt
miss
travers
wished
to
make
it
appear
she
said
that
she
had
an
intrigue
with
sir
william
wilde
but
in
her
opinion
it
was
utterly
untrue
sir
william
wilde
was
above
suspicion
there
was
not
a
particle
of
truth
in
the
accusation
her
husband
would
never
so
demean
himself
lady
wilde
disdainful
speeches
seemed
to
persuade
the
populace
but
had
small
effect
on
the
jury
and
still
less
on
the
judge
when
she
was
asked
if
she
hated
miss
travers
she
replied
that
she
did
not
hate
anyone
but
she
had
to
admit
that
she
disliked
miss
travers
methods
of
action
why
did
you
not
answer
miss
travers
when
she
wrote
telling
you
of
your
husband
attempt
on
her
virtue
i
took
no
interest
in
the
matter
was
the
astounding
reply
the
defence
made
an
even
worse
mistake
than
this
when
the
time
came
sir
william
wilde
was
not
called
in
his
speech
for
miss
travers
mr
butt
made
the
most
of
this
omission
he
declared
that
the
refusal
of
sir
william
wilde
to
go
into
the
witness
box
was
an
admission
of
guilt
an
admission
that
miss
travers
story
of
her
betrayal
was
true
and
could
not
be
contradicted
but
the
refusal
of
sir
william
wilde
to
go
into
the
box
was
not
he
insisted
the
worst
point
in
the
defence
he
reminded
the
jury
that
he
had
asked
lady
wilde
why
she
had
not
answered
miss
travers
when
she
wrote
to
her
he
recalled
lady
wilde
reply
i
took
no
interest
in
the
matter
every
woman
would
be
interested
in
such
a
thing
he
declared
even
a
stranger
but
lady
wilde
hated
her
husband
victim
and
took
no
interest
in
her
seduction
beyond
writing
a
bitter
vindictive
and
libellous
letter
to
the
girl
father
the
speech
was
regarded
as
a
masterpiece
and
enhanced
the
already
great
reputation
of
the
man
who
was
afterwards
to
become
the
home
rule
leader
it
only
remained
for
the
judge
to
sum
up
for
everyone
was
getting
impatient
to
hear
the
verdict
chief
justice
monahan
made
a
short
impartial
speech
throwing
the
dry
white
light
of
truth
upon
the
conflicting
and
passionate
statements
first
of
all
he
said
it
was
difficult
to
believe
in
the
story
of
rape
whether
with
or
without
chloroform
if
the
girl
had
been
violated
she
would
be
expected
to
cry
out
at
the
time
or
at
least
to
complain
to
her
father
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
had
it
been
a
criminal
trial
he
pointed
out
no
one
would
have
believed
this
part
of
miss
travers
story
when
you
find
a
girl
does
not
cry
out
at
the
time
and
does
not
complain
afterwards
and
returns
to
the
house
to
meet
further
rudeness
it
must
be
presumed
that
she
consented
to
the
seduction
but
was
there
a
seduction
the
girl
asserted
that
there
was
guilty
intimacy
and
sir
william
wilde
had
not
contradicted
her
it
was
said
that
he
was
only
formally
a
defendant
but
he
was
the
real
defendant
and
he
could
have
gone
into
the
box
if
he
had
liked
and
given
his
version
of
what
took
place
and
contradicted
miss
travers
in
whole
or
in
part
it
is
for
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
from
his
omission
to
do
what
one
would
have
thought
would
be
an
honourable
first
impulse
and
duty
finally
it
was
for
the
jury
to
consider
whether
the
letter
was
a
libel
and
if
so
what
the
amount
of
damages
should
be
his
lordship
recalled
the
jury
at
mr
butt
request
to
say
that
in
assessing
damages
they
might
also
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
defence
was
practically
a
justification
of
the
libel
the
of
the
judge
was
conspicuous
from
first
to
last
and
was
worthy
of
the
high
traditions
of
the
irish
bench
after
deliberating
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
which
had
a
certain
humour
in
it
they
awarded
to
miss
travers
a
farthing
damages
and
intimated
that
the
farthing
should
carry
costs
in
other
words
they
rated
miss
travers
virtue
at
the
very
lowest
coin
of
the
realm
while
insisting
that
sir
william
wilde
should
pay
a
couple
of
thousands
of
pounds
in
costs
for
having
seduced
her
it
was
generally
felt
that
the
verdict
did
substantial
justice
though
the
jury
led
away
by
patriotic
sympathy
with
lady
wilde
the
true
speranza
had
been
a
little
hard
on
miss
travers
no
one
doubted
that
sir
william
wilde
had
seduced
his
patient
he
had
it
appeared
an
unholy
reputation
and
the
girl
admission
that
he
had
accused
her
of
being
unnaturally
passionless
was
accepted
as
the
true
key
of
the
enigma
this
was
why
he
had
drawn
away
from
the
girl
after
seducing
her
and
it
was
not
unnatural
under
the
circumstances
that
she
should
become
vindictive
and
revengeful
such
inferences
as
these
i
drew
from
the
comments
of
the
irish
papers
at
the
time
but
naturally
i
wished
if
possible
to
hear
some
trustworthy
contemporary
on
the
matter
fortunately
such
testimony
was
forthcoming
a
fellow
of
trinity
who
was
then
a
young
man
embodied
the
best
opinion
of
the
time
in
an
excellent
pithy
letter
he
wrote
to
me
that
the
trial
simply
established
what
every
one
believed
that
sir
william
wilde
was
a
pithecoid
person
of
extraordinary
sensuality
and
cowardice
funking
the
left
him
without
a
defender
and
that
his
wife
was
a
highfalutin
pretentious
creature
whose
pride
was
as
extravagant
as
her
reputation
founded
on
even
when
a
young
woman
she
used
to
keep
her
rooms
in
merrion
square
in
she
laid
the
paint
on
too
thick
for
any
ordinary
light
and
she
gave
herself
besides
all
manner
of
airs
this
incisive
judgment
of
an
able
and
fairly
impartial
contemporary
as
he
has
died
since
this
was
written
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
concealing
his
name
tyrrell
for
many
years
before
his
death
regius
professor
of
greek
in
trinity
college
dublin
corroborates
i
think
the
inferences
which
one
would
naturally
draw
from
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
trial
it
seems
to
me
that
both
combine
to
give
a
realistic
photograph
so
to
speak
of
sir
william
and
lady
wilde
an
artist
however
would
lean
to
a
more
kindly
picture
trying
to
see
the
personages
as
they
saw
themselves
he
would
balance
the
doctor
excessive
sensuality
and
lack
of
by
dwelling
on
the
fact
that
his
energy
and
perseverance
and
intimate
adaptation
to
his
surroundings
had
brought
him
in
middle
age
to
the
chief
place
in
his
profession
and
if
lady
wilde
was
abnormally
vain
a
and
not
a
poet
she
was
still
a
talented
woman
of
considerable
reading
and
manifold
artistic
sympathies
such
were
the
father
and
mother
of
oscar
wilde
chapter
ii
oscar
wilde
as
a
schoolboy
the
wildes
had
three
children
two
sons
and
a
daughter
the
first
son
was
born
in
a
year
after
the
marriage
and
was
christened
after
his
father
william
charles
kingsbury
wills
the
second
son
was
born
two
years
later
in
and
the
names
given
to
him
seem
to
reveal
the
nationalist
sympathies
and
pride
of
his
mother
he
was
christened
oscar
fingal
wills
wilde
but
he
appears
to
have
suffered
from
the
pompous
string
only
in
extreme
youth
at
school
he
concealed
the
fingal
as
a
young
man
he
found
it
advisable
to
omit
the
in
childhood
and
early
boyhood
oscar
was
not
considered
as
quick
or
engaging
or
handsome
as
his
brother
willie
both
boys
had
the
benefit
of
the
best
schooling
of
the
time
they
were
sent
as
boarders
to
the
portora
school
at
enniskillen
one
of
the
four
royal
schools
of
ireland
oscar
went
to
portora
in
at
the
age
of
nine
a
couple
of
years
after
his
brother
he
remained
at
the
school
for
seven
years
and
left
it
on
winning
an
exhibition
for
trinity
college
dublin
when
he
was
just
seventeen
the
facts
hitherto
collected
and
published
about
oscar
as
a
schoolboy
are
sadly
meagre
and
insignificant
fortunately
for
my
readers
i
have
received
from
sir
edward
sullivan
who
was
a
contemporary
of
oscar
both
at
school
and
college
an
exceedingly
vivid
and
interesting
of
the
lad
one
of
those
astounding
masterpieces
of
portraiture
only
to
be
produced
by
the
plastic
sympathies
of
boyhood
and
the
intimate
intercourse
of
years
lived
in
common
it
is
love
alone
which
in
later
life
can
achieve
such
a
miracle
of
representment
i
am
very
glad
to
be
allowed
to
publish
this
realistic
miniature
in
the
very
words
of
the
author
i
first
met
oscar
wilde
in
the
early
part
of
at
portora
royal
school
he
was
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
his
long
straight
fair
hair
was
a
striking
feature
of
his
appearance
he
was
then
as
he
remained
for
some
years
after
extremely
boyish
in
nature
very
mobile
almost
restless
when
out
of
the
schoolroom
yet
he
took
no
part
in
the
school
games
at
any
time
now
and
then
he
would
be
seen
in
one
of
the
school
boats
on
loch
erne
yet
he
was
a
poor
hand
at
an
oar
even
as
a
schoolboy
he
was
an
excellent
talker
his
descriptive
power
being
far
above
the
average
and
his
humorous
exaggerations
of
school
occurrences
always
highly
amusing
a
favourite
place
for
the
boys
to
sit
and
gossip
in
the
late
afternoon
in
winter
time
was
round
a
stove
which
stood
in
stone
hall
here
oscar
was
at
his
best
although
his
brother
willie
was
perhaps
in
those
days
even
better
than
he
was
at
telling
a
story
oscar
would
frequently
vary
the
entertainment
by
giving
us
extremely
quaint
illustrations
of
holy
people
in
attitudes
his
power
of
twisting
his
limbs
into
weird
contortions
being
very
great
i
am
told
that
sir
william
wilde
his
father
possessed
the
same
power
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
there
was
any
suggestion
of
irreverence
in
the
exhibition
at
one
of
these
gatherings
about
the
year
i
remember
a
discussion
taking
place
about
an
ecclesiastical
prosecution
that
made
a
considerable
stir
at
the
time
oscar
was
present
and
full
of
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
court
of
arches
he
told
us
there
was
nothing
he
would
like
better
in
after
life
than
to
be
the
hero
of
such
a
cause
celebre
and
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
defendant
in
such
a
case
as
versus
wilde
at
school
he
was
almost
always
called
but
he
had
a
which
the
boys
would
call
him
when
they
wished
to
annoy
him
and
which
he
resented
greatly
it
was
derived
in
some
mysterious
way
from
the
name
of
an
island
in
the
upper
loch
erne
within
easy
reach
of
the
school
by
boat
it
was
some
little
time
before
he
left
portora
that
the
boys
got
to
know
of
his
full
name
oscar
fingal
wills
wilde
just
at
the
close
of
his
school
career
he
won
the
greek
testament
prize
and
on
presentation
day
was
called
up
to
the
dais
by
steele
by
all
his
names
much
to
annoyance
for
a
great
deal
of
schoolboy
chaff
followed
he
was
always
generous
kindly
i
remember
he
and
myself
were
on
one
occasion
mounted
as
opposing
jockeys
on
the
backs
of
two
bigger
boys
in
what
we
called
a
held
in
one
of
the
oscar
and
his
horse
were
thrown
and
the
result
was
a
broken
arm
for
wilde
knowing
that
it
was
an
accident
he
did
not
let
it
make
any
difference
in
our
friendship
he
had
i
think
no
very
special
chums
while
at
school
i
was
perhaps
as
friendly
with
him
all
through
as
anybody
though
his
junior
in
class
by
a
year
willie
wilde
was
never
very
familiar
with
him
treating
him
always
in
those
days
as
a
younger
brother
when
in
the
head
class
together
we
with
two
other
boys
were
in
the
town
of
enniskillen
one
afternoon
and
formed
part
of
an
audience
who
were
listening
to
a
street
orator
one
of
us
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
got
near
the
speaker
and
with
a
stick
knocked
his
hat
off
and
then
ran
for
home
followed
by
the
other
three
several
of
the
listeners
resenting
the
impertinence
gave
chase
and
oscar
in
his
hurry
collided
with
an
aged
cripple
and
threw
him
down
a
fact
which
was
duly
reported
to
the
boys
when
we
got
safely
back
oscar
was
afterwards
heard
telling
how
he
found
his
way
barred
by
an
angry
giant
with
whom
he
fought
through
many
rounds
and
whom
he
eventually
left
for
dead
in
the
road
after
accomplishing
prodigies
of
valour
on
his
redoubtable
opponent
romantic
imagination
was
strong
in
him
even
in
those
schoolboy
days
but
there
was
always
something
in
his
telling
of
such
a
tale
to
suggest
that
he
felt
his
hearers
were
not
really
being
taken
in
it
was
merely
the
romancing
indulged
in
so
humorously
by
the
two
principal
male
characters
in
importance
of
being
earnest
he
never
took
any
interest
in
mathematics
either
at
school
or
college
he
laughed
at
science
and
never
had
a
good
word
for
a
mathematical
or
science
master
but
there
was
nothing
spiteful
or
malignant
in
anything
he
said
against
them
or
indeed
against
anybody
the
romances
that
impressed
him
most
when
at
school
were
disraeli
novels
he
spoke
slightingly
of
dickens
as
a
novelist
the
classics
absorbed
almost
his
whole
attention
in
his
later
school
days
and
the
flowing
beauty
of
his
oral
translations
in
class
whether
of
thucydides
plato
or
virgil
was
a
thing
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
this
photograph
so
to
speak
of
oscar
as
a
schoolboy
is
astonishingly
clear
and
lifelike
but
i
have
another
portrait
of
him
from
another
contemporary
who
has
since
made
for
himself
a
high
name
as
a
scholar
at
trinity
which
while
confirming
the
general
traits
sketched
by
sir
edward
sullivan
takes
somewhat
more
notice
of
certain
mental
qualities
which
came
later
to
the
fruiting
this
observer
who
does
not
wish
his
name
given
writes
oscar
had
a
pungent
wit
and
nearly
all
the
nicknames
in
the
school
were
given
by
him
he
was
very
good
on
the
literary
side
of
scholarship
with
a
special
leaning
to
poetry
we
noticed
that
he
always
liked
to
have
editions
of
the
classics
that
were
of
stately
size
with
large
print
he
was
more
careful
in
his
dress
than
any
other
boy
he
was
a
wide
reader
and
read
very
fast
indeed
how
much
he
assimilated
i
never
could
make
out
he
was
poor
at
music
we
thought
him
a
fair
scholar
but
nothing
extraordinary
however
he
startled
everyone
the
last
year
at
school
in
the
classical
medal
examination
by
walking
easily
away
from
us
all
in
the
viva
voce
of
the
greek
play
agamemnon
i
may
now
try
and
accentuate
a
trait
or
two
of
these
photographs
so
to
speak
and
then
realise
the
whole
portrait
by
adding
an
account
given
to
me
by
oscar
himself
the
joy
in
humorous
romancing
and
the
sweetness
of
temper
recorded
by
sir
edward
sullivan
were
marked
traits
in
oscar
character
all
through
his
life
his
care
in
dressing
too
and
his
delight
in
stately
editions
his
love
of
literature
with
a
special
leaning
to
poetry
were
all
qualities
which
distinguished
him
to
the
end
until
the
last
year
of
my
school
life
at
portora
he
said
to
me
once
i
had
nothing
like
the
reputation
of
my
brother
willie
i
read
too
many
english
novels
too
much
poetry
dreamed
away
too
much
time
to
master
the
school
tasks
knowledge
came
to
me
through
pleasure
as
it
always
comes
i
imagine
i
was
nearly
sixteen
when
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
the
old
greek
life
began
to
dawn
upon
me
suddenly
i
seemed
to
see
the
white
figures
throwing
purple
shadows
on
the
palaestra
of
nude
youths
and
maidens
you
remember
gautier
words
across
a
background
of
deep
blue
as
on
the
frieze
of
the
parthenon
i
began
to
read
greek
eagerly
for
love
of
it
all
and
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
was
enthralled
oh
what
golden
hours
were
for
us
as
we
sat
together
there
while
the
white
vests
of
the
chorus
seemed
to
wave
up
a
light
air
while
the
cothurns
trod
majestic
down
the
deep
iambic
lines
and
the
rolling
anapaestics
curled
like
vapour
over
shrines
the
head
master
was
always
holding
my
brother
willie
up
to
me
as
an
example
but
even
he
admitted
that
in
my
last
year
at
portora
i
had
made
astounding
progress
i
laid
the
foundation
there
of
whatever
classical
scholarship
i
possess
it
occurred
to
me
once
to
ask
oscar
in
later
years
whether
the
boarding
school
life
of
a
great
public
school
was
not
responsible
for
a
good
deal
of
sensual
viciousness
englishmen
all
say
so
he
replied
but
it
did
not
enter
into
my
experience
i
was
very
childish
frank
a
mere
boy
till
i
was
over
sixteen
of
course
i
was
sensual
and
curious
as
boys
are
and
had
the
usual
boy
imaginings
but
i
did
not
indulge
in
them
excessively
at
portora
nine
out
of
ten
boys
only
thought
of
football
or
cricket
or
rowing
nearly
every
one
went
in
for
athletics
running
and
jumping
and
so
forth
no
one
appeared
to
care
for
sex
we
were
healthy
young
barbarians
and
that
was
all
did
you
go
in
for
games
i
asked
no
oscar
replied
smiling
i
never
liked
to
kick
or
be
kicked
surely
you
went
about
with
some
younger
boy
did
you
not
to
whom
you
told
your
dreams
and
hopes
and
whom
you
grew
to
care
for
the
question
led
to
an
intimate
personal
confession
which
may
take
its
place
here
it
is
strange
you
should
have
mentioned
it
he
said
there
was
one
boy
and
he
added
slowly
one
peculiar
incident
it
occurred
in
my
last
year
at
portora
the
boy
was
a
couple
of
years
younger
than
i
we
were
great
friends
we
used
to
take
long
walks
together
and
i
talked
to
him
interminably
i
told
him
what
i
should
have
done
had
i
been
alexander
or
how
i
have
played
king
in
athens
had
i
been
alcibiades
as
early
as
i
can
remember
i
used
to
identify
myself
with
every
distinguished
character
i
read
about
but
when
i
was
fifteen
or
sixteen
i
noticed
with
some
wonder
that
i
could
think
of
myself
as
alcibiades
or
sophocles
more
easily
than
as
alexander
or
caesar
the
life
of
books
had
begun
to
interest
me
more
than
real
life
my
friend
had
a
wonderful
gift
for
listening
i
was
so
occupied
with
talking
and
telling
about
myself
that
i
knew
very
little
about
him
curiously
little
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
but
the
last
incident
of
my
school
life
makes
me
think
he
was
a
sort
of
mute
poet
and
had
much
more
in
him
than
i
imagined
it
was
just
before
i
first
heard
that
i
had
won
an
exhibition
and
was
to
go
to
trinity
steele
had
called
me
into
his
study
to
tell
me
the
great
news
he
was
very
glad
he
said
and
insisted
that
it
was
all
due
to
my
last
hard
work
the
work
had
been
very
interesting
to
me
or
i
would
not
have
done
much
of
it
the
doctor
wound
up
i
remember
by
assuring
me
that
if
i
went
on
studying
as
i
had
been
studying
during
the
last
year
i
might
yet
do
as
well
as
my
brother
willie
and
be
as
great
an
honour
to
the
school
and
everybody
connected
with
it
as
he
had
been
this
made
me
smile
for
though
i
liked
willie
and
knew
he
was
a
fairly
good
scholar
i
never
for
a
moment
regarded
him
as
my
equal
in
any
intellectual
field
he
knew
all
about
football
and
cricket
and
studied
the
schoolbooks
assiduously
whereas
i
read
everything
that
pleased
me
and
in
my
own
opinion
always
went
about
here
he
laughed
charmingly
with
amused
deprecation
of
the
conceit
it
was
only
about
the
quality
of
the
crown
frank
that
i
was
in
any
doubt
if
i
had
been
offered
the
triple
tiara
it
would
have
appeared
to
me
only
the
meet
reward
of
my
extraordinary
merit
when
i
came
out
from
the
doctor
i
hurried
to
my
friend
to
tell
him
all
the
wonderful
news
to
my
surprise
he
was
cold
and
said
a
little
bitterly
i
thought

glad
to
go
to
go
i
cried
should
think
i
was
fancy
going
to
trinity
college
dublin
from
this
place
why
i
shall
meet
men
and
not
boys
of
course
i
am
glad
wild
with
delight
the
first
step
to
oxford
and
fame
mean
my
chum
went
on
still
in
the
same
cold
way
seem
glad
to
leave
me
his
tone
startled
me
silly
fellow
i
exclaimed
course

i
always
glad
to
be
with
you
but
perhaps
you
will
be
coming
up
to
trinity

wo

afraid

he
said
i
shall
come
to
dublin

i
remarked

come
and
see
me
in
my
rooms
my
father
will
give
me
a
room
to
myself
in
our
house
and
you
know
merrion
square
is
the
best
part
of
dublin
you
must
come
and
see
me
he
looked
up
at
me
with
yearning
sad
regretful
eyes
but
the
future
was
beckoning
to
me
and
i
could
not
help
talking
about
it
for
the
golden
key
of
wonderland
was
in
my
hand
and
i
was
wild
with
desires
and
hopes
my
friend
was
very
silent
i
remember
and
only
interrupted
me
to
ask
do
you
go
oscar
i
replied
thoughtlessly
or
rather
full
of
my
own
thoughts
morning
i
believe
the
usual
train
in
the
morning
just
as
i
was
starting
for
the
station
having
said
to
everyone
he
came
up
to
me
very
pale
and
strangely
quiet
coming
with
you
to
the
station
oscar
he
said
doctor
gave
me
permission
when
i
told
him
what
friends
we
had
been
glad
i
cried
my
conscience
pricking
me
that
i
had
not
thought
of
asking
for
his
company
very
glad
my
last
hours
at
school
will
always
be
associated
with
you
he
just
glanced
up
at
me
and
the
glance
surprised
me
it
was
like
a
dog
looks
at
one
but
my
own
hopes
soon
took
possession
of
me
again
and
i
can
only
remember
being
vaguely
surprised
by
the
appeal
in
his
regard
when
i
was
settled
in
my
seat
in
the
train
he
did
not
say
and
go
and
leave
me
to
my
dreams
but
brought
me
papers
and
things
and
hung
about
the
guard
came
and
said
sir
if
you
are
going
i
liked
the
to
my
surprise
my
friend
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
said
right
guard
i
not
going
but
i
shall
slip
out
as
soon
as
you
whistle
the
guard
touched
his
cap
and
went
i
said
something
i
do
know
what
i
was
a
little
embarrassed
will
write
to
me
oscar
wo
you
and
tell
me
about
everything
yes
i
replied
soon
as
i
get
settled
down
you
know
there
will
be
such
a
lot
to
do
at
first
and
i
am
wild
to
see
everything
i
wonder
how
the
professors
will
treat
me
i
do
hope
they
will
not
be
fools
or
prigs
what
a
pity
it
is
that
all
professors
are
not
poets
and
so
i
went
on
merrily
when
suddenly
the
whistle
sounded
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
train
began
to
move
must
go
now
i
said
to
him
he
replied
in
a
queer
muffled
voice
while
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
door
of
the
carriage
suddenly
he
turned
to
me
and
cried
oscar
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
caught
my
face
in
his
hot
hands
and
kissed
me
on
the
lips
the
next
moment
he
had
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
was
gone
i
sat
there
all
shaken
suddenly
i
became
aware
of
cold
sticky
drops
trickling
down
my
face
his
tears
they
affected
me
strangely
as
i
wiped
them
off
i
said
to
myself
in
amaze
is
love
this
is
what
he
meant
love
i
was
trembling
all
over
for
a
long
while
i
sat
unable
to
think
all
shaken
with
wonder
and
remorse
chapter

trinity
dublin
magdalen
oxford
oscar
wilde
did
well
at
school
but
he
did
still
better
at
college
where
the
competition
was
more
severe
he
entered
trinity
on
october
just
three
days
after
his
seventeenth
birthday
sir
edward
sullivan
writes
me
that
when
oscar
matriculated
at
trinity
he
was
already
a
thoroughly
good
classical
scholar
of
a
brilliant
type
and
he
goes
on
to
give
an
invaluable
of
him
at
this
time
a
likeness
in
fact
the
chief
features
of
which
grew
more
and
more
characteristic
as
the
years
went
on
he
had
rooms
in
college
at
the
north
side
of
one
of
the
older
squares
known
as
botany
bay
these
rooms
were
exceedingly
grimy
and
he
never
entertained
there
on
the
rare
occasions
when
visitors
were
admitted
an
unfinished
landscape
in
oils
was
always
on
the
easel
in
a
prominent
place
in
his
sitting
room
he
would
invariably
refer
to
it
telling
one
in
his
humorously
unconvincing
way
that
had
just
put
in
the
butterfly
those
of
us
who
had
seen
his
work
in
the
drawing
class
presided
over
by
wakeman
at
portora
were
not
likely
to
be
deceived
in
the
matter
his
college
life
was
mainly
one
of
study
in
addition
to
working
for
his
classical
examinations
he
devoured
with
voracity
all
the
best
english
writers
he
was
an
intense
admirer
of
swinburne
and
constantly
reading
his
poems
john
addington
symond
works
too
on
the
greek
authors
were
perpetually
in
his
hands
he
never
entertained
any
pronounced
views
on
social
religious
or
political
questions
while
in
college
he
seemed
to
be
altogether
devoted
to
literary
matters
he
mixed
freely
at
the
same
time
in
dublin
society
functions
of
all
kinds
and
was
always
a
very
vivacious
and
welcome
guest
at
any
house
he
cared
to
visit
all
through
his
dublin
university
days
he
was
one
of
the
purest
minded
men
that
could
be
met
with
he
was
not
a
card
player
but
would
on
occasions
join
in
a
game
of
limited
loo
at
some
man
rooms
he
was
also
an
extremely
moderate
drinker
he
became
a
member
of
the
junior
debating
society
the
philosophical
but
hardly
ever
took
any
part
in
their
discussions
he
read
for
the
berkeley
medal
which
he
afterwards
gained
with
an
excellent
but
at
the
same
time
classical
scholar
john
townsend
mills
and
besides
instruction
he
contrived
to
get
a
good
deal
of
amusement
out
of
his
readings
with
his
quaint
teacher
he
told
me
for
instance
that
on
one
occasion
he
expressed
his
sympathy
for
mills
on
seeing
him
come
into
his
rooms
wearing
a
tall
hat
completely
covered
in
crape
mills
however
replied
with
a
smile
that
no
one
was
dead
it
was
only
the
evil
condition
of
his
hat
that
had
made
him
assume
so
mournful
a
disguise
i
have
often
thought
that
the
incident
was
still
fresh
in
oscar
wilde
mind
when
he
introduced
john
worthing
in
importance
of
being
earnest
in
mourning
for
his
fictitious
brother
shortly
before
he
started
on
his
first
trip
to
italy
he
came
into
my
rooms
in
a
very
striking
pair
of
trousers
i
made
some
chaffing
remark
on
them
but
he
begged
me
in
the
most
serious
style
of
which
he
was
so
excellent
a
master
not
to
jest
about
them
are
my
trasimene
trousers
and
i
mean
to
wear
them
there
already
his
humour
was
beginning
to
strike
all
his
acquaintances
and
what
sir
edward
sullivan
here
calls
his
puremindedness
or
what
i
should
rather
call
his
peculiar
refinement
of
nature
no
one
ever
heard
oscar
wilde
tell
a
suggestive
story
indeed
he
always
shrank
from
any
gross
or
crude
expression
even
his
mouth
was
vowed
always
to
pure
beauty
the
trinity
don
whom
i
have
already
quoted
about
oscar
sends
me
a
rather
severe
critical
judgment
of
him
as
a
student
there
is
some
truth
in
it
however
for
in
part
at
least
it
was
borne
out
and
corroborated
by
oscar
later
achievement
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
don
was
one
of
his
competitors
at
trinity
and
a
successful
one
oscar
mind
could
not
limit
itself
to
college
tasks
and
prescribed
books
when
oscar
came
to
college
he
did
excellently
during
the
first
year
he
was
top
of
his
class
in
classics
but
he
did
not
do
so
well
in
the
long
examinations
for
a
classical
scholarship
in
his
second
year
he
was
placed
fifth
which
was
considered
very
good
but
he
was
plainly
not
the
man
for
the
dolichos
or
long
struggle
though
for
a
short
examination
oscar
himself
only
completed
these
by
what
he
told
me
of
his
life
at
trinity
it
was
the
fascination
of
greek
letters
and
the
delight
i
took
in
greek
life
and
thought
he
said
to
me
once
which
made
me
a
scholar
i
got
my
love
of
the
greek
ideal
and
my
intimate
knowledge
of
the
language
at
trinity
from
mahaffy
and
tyrrell
they
were
trinity
to
me
mahaffy
was
especially
valuable
to
me
at
that
time
though
not
so
good
a
scholar
as
tyrrell
he
had
been
in
greece
had
lived
there
and
saturated
himself
with
greek
thought
and
greek
feeling
besides
he
took
deliberately
the
artistic
standpoint
towards
everything
which
was
coming
more
and
more
to
be
my
standpoint
he
was
a
delightful
talker
too
a
really
great
talker
in
a
certain
way
an
artist
in
vivid
words
and
eloquent
pauses
tyrrell
too
was
very
kind
to
me
intensely
sympathetic
and
crammed
with
knowledge
if
he
had
known
less
he
would
have
been
a
poet
learning
is
a
sad
handicap
frank
an
appalling
handicap
and
he
laughed
irresistibly
what
were
the
students
like
in
dublin
i
asked
did
you
make
friends
with
any
of
them
they
were
worse
even
than
the
boys
at
portora
he
replied
they
thought
of
nothing
but
cricket
and
football
running
and
jumping
and
they
varied
these
intellectual
exercises
with
bouts
of
fighting
and
drinking
if
they
had
any
souls
they
diverted
them
with
coarse
amours
among
barmaids
and
the
women
of
the
streets
they
were
simply
awful
sexual
vice
is
even
coarser
and
more
loathsome
in
ireland
than
it
is
in
england
that
fester
smell
far
worse
than
weeds
when
i
tried
to
talk
they
broke
into
my
thought
with
stupid
gibes
and
jokes
their
highest
idea
of
humour
was
an
obscene
story
no
no
tyrrell
and
mahaffy
represent
to
me
whatever
was
good
in
trinity
in
oscar
wilde
won
the
gold
medal
for
greek
the
subject
of
the
year
was
the
fragments
of
the
greek
comic
poets
as
edited
by
meineke
in
this
year
too
he
won
a
classical
scholarship
a
demyship
of
the
annual
value
of
which
was
tenable
for
five
years
which
enabled
him
to
go
to
oxford
without
throwing
an
undue
strain
on
his
father
means
he
noticed
with
delight
that
his
success
was
announced
in
the
oxford
university
gazette
of
july
he
entered
magdalen
college
oxford
on
october
a
day
after
his
twentieth
birthday
just
as
he
had
been
more
successful
at
trinity
than
at
school
so
he
was
destined
to
be
far
more
successful
and
win
a
far
greater
reputation
at
oxford
than
in
dublin
he
had
the
advantage
of
going
to
oxford
a
little
later
than
most
men
at
twenty
instead
of
eighteen
and
thus
was
enabled
to
win
high
honours
with
comparative
ease
while
leading
a
life
of
cultured
enjoyment
he
was
placed
in
the
first
class
in
moderations
in
and
had
even
then
managed
to
make
himself
talked
about
in
the
life
of
the
place
the
trinity
don
whom
i
have
already
quoted
after
admitting
that
there
was
not
a
breath
against
his
character
either
at
school
or
trinity
goes
on
to
write
that
at
trinity
he
did
not
strike
us
as
a
very
exceptional
person
and
yet
there
must
have
been
some
sharp
eyes
at
trinity
for
our
don
adds
with
surprising
divination
i
fancy
his
rapid
development
took
place
after
he
went
to
oxford
where
he
was
able
to
specialize
more
in
fact
where
he
could
study
what
he
most
affected
it
is
i
feel
sure
from
his
oxford
life
more
than
from
his
life
in
ireland
that
one
would
be
able
to
trace
the
good
and
bad
features
by
which
he
afterwards
attracted
the
attention
of
the
world
in
oscar
won
a
first
class
in
greats
in
this
same
trinity
term
he
further
distinguished
himself
by
gaining
the
newdigate
prize
for
english
verse
with
his
poem
ravenna
which
he
recited
at
the
annual
commemoration
in
the
sheldonian
theatre
on
june
his
reciting
of
the
poem
was
the
literary
event
of
the
year
in
oxford
there
had
been
great
curiosity
about
him
he
was
said
to
be
the
best
talker
of
the
day
and
one
of
the
ripest
scholars
there
were
those
in
the
university
who
predicted
an
astonishing
future
for
him
and
indeed
all
possibilities
seemed
within
his
reach
his
verses
were
listened
to
said
the
oxford
and
cambridge
undergraduates
journal
with
rapt
attention
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
half
poetry
half
rhythmic
rhetoric
which
was
sure
to
reach
the
hearts
and
minds
of
youth
his
voice
too
was
of
beautiful
tenor
quality
and
exquisitely
used
when
he
sat
down
people
crowded
to
praise
him
and
even
men
of
great
distinction
in
life
flattered
him
with
extravagant
compliments
strange
to
say
he
used
always
to
declare
that
his
appearance
about
the
same
time
as
prince
rupert
at
a
fancy
dress
ball
given
by
george
morrell
at
headington
hill
hall
afforded
him
a
far
more
gratifying
proof
of
the
exceptional
position
he
had
won
everyone
came
round
me
frank
and
made
me
talk
i
hardly
danced
at
all
i
went
as
prince
rupert
and
i
talked
as
he
charged
but
with
more
success
for
i
turned
all
my
foes
into
friends
i
had
the
divinest
evening
oxford
meant
so
much
to
me
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
oxford
did
for
me
i
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
when
i
entered
magdalen
for
the
first
time
oxford
the
mere
word
to
me
is
full
of
an
inexpressible
an
incommunicable
charm
oxford
the
home
of
lost
causes
and
impossible
ideals
matthew
arnold
oxford
with
its
dreaming
spires
and
grey
colleges
set
in
velvet
lawns
and
hidden
away
among
the
trees
and
about
it
the
beautiful
fields
all
starred
with
cowslips
and
fritillaries
where
the
quiet
river
winds
its
way
to
london
and
the
sea
the
change
frank
to
me
was
astounding
trinity
was
as
barbarian
as
school
with
coarseness
superadded
if
it
had
not
been
for
two
or
three
people
i
should
have
been
worse
off
at
trinity
than
at
portora
but
oxford
oxford
was
paradise
to
me
my
very
soul
seemed
to
expand
within
me
to
peace
and
joy
oxford
the
enchanted
valley
holding
in
its
flowerlet
cup
all
the
idealism
of
the
middle
ages
oscar
was
always
fond
of
loosely
quoting
or
paraphrasing
in
conversation
the
purple
passages
from
contemporary
writers
he
said
them
exquisitely
and
sometimes
his
own
embroidery
was
as
good
as
the
original
this
discipleship
however
always
suggested
to
me
a
lack
of
originality
in
especial
matthew
arnold
had
an
extraordinary
influence
upon
him
almost
as
great
indeed
as
pater
oxford
is
the
capital
of
romance
frank
in
its
own
way
as
memorable
as
athens
and
to
me
it
was
even
more
entrancing
in
oxford
as
in
athens
the
realities
of
sordid
life
were
kept
at
a
distance
no
one
seemed
to
know
anything
about
money
or
care
anything
for
it
everywhere
the
aristocratic
feeling
one
must
have
money
but
must
not
bother
about
it
and
all
the
appurtenances
of
life
were
perfect
the
food
the
wine
the
cigarettes
the
common
needs
of
life
became
artistic
symbols
our
clothes
even
won
meaning
and
significance
it
was
at
oxford
i
first
dressed
in
knee
breeches
and
silk
stockings
i
almost
reformed
fashion
and
made
modern
dress
aesthetically
beautiful
a
second
and
greater
reformation
frank
what
a
pity
it
is
that
luther
knew
nothing
of
dress
had
no
sense
of
the
becoming
he
had
courage
but
no
fineness
of
perception
i
afraid
his
neckties
would
always
have
been
quite
shocking
and
he
laughed
charmingly
what
about
the
inside
of
the
platter
oscar
ah
frank
do
ask
me
i
do
know
there
was
no
grossness
no
coarseness
but
all
delicate
delights
passions
and
bountiful
pities
and
loves
without
pain
stain
not
pain
in
the
original
and
he
laughed
mischievously
at
the
misquotation
loves
i
questioned
and
he
nodded
his
head
smiling
but
would
not
be
drawn
all
romantic
and
ideal
affections
every
successive
wave
of
youths
from
the
public
schools
brought
some
chosen
spirits
perfectly
wonderful
persons
the
most
graceful
and
fascinating
disciples
that
a
poet
could
desire
and
i
preached
the
gospel
of
individual
revolt
and
individual
perfection
i
showed
them
that
sin
with
its
curiosities
widened
the
horizons
of
life
prejudices
and
prohibitions
are
mere
walls
to
imprison
the
soul
indulgence
may
hurt
the
body
frank
but
nothing
except
suffering
hurts
the
spirit
it
is
and
abstinence
that
maim
and
deform
the
soul
then
they
knew
you
as
a
great
talker
even
at
oxford
i
asked
in
some
surprise
frank
he
cried
reprovingly
laughing
at
the
same
time
delightfully
i
was
a
great
talker
at
school
i
did
nothing
at
trinity
but
talk
my
reading
was
done
at
odd
hours
i
was
the
best
talker
ever
seen
in
oxford
and
did
you
find
any
teacher
there
like
mahaffy
i
asked
any
professor
with
a
touch
of
the
poet
he
came
to
seriousness
at
once
there
were
two
or
three
teachers
frank
he
replied
greater
than
mahaffy
teachers
of
the
world
as
well
as
of
oxford
there
was
ruskin
for
instance
who
appealed
to
me
intensely
a
wonderful
man
and
a
most
wonderful
writer
a
sort
of
exquisite
romantic
flower
like
a
violet
filling
the
whole
air
with
the
ineffable
perfume
of
belief
ruskin
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
plato
of
england
a
prophet
of
the
good
and
true
and
beautiful
who
saw
as
plato
saw
that
the
three
are
one
perfect
flower
but
it
was
his
prose
i
loved
and
not
his
piety
his
sympathy
with
the
poor
bored
me
the
road
he
wanted
us
to
build
was
tiresome
i
could
see
nothing
in
poverty
that
appealed
to
me
nothing
i
shrank
away
from
it
as
from
a
degradation
of
the
spirit
but
his
prose
was
lyrical
and
rose
on
broad
wings
into
the
blue
he
was
a
great
poet
and
teacher
frank
and
therefore
of
course
a
most
preposterous
professor
he
bored
you
to
death
when
he
taught
but
was
an
inspiration
when
he
sang
then
there
was
pater
pater
the
classic
pater
the
scholar
who
had
already
written
the
greatest
english
prose
i
think
a
page
or
two
of
the
greatest
prose
in
all
literature
pater
meant
everything
to
me
he
taught
me
the
highest
form
of
art
the
austerity
of
beauty
i
came
to
my
full
growth
with
pater
he
was
a
sort
of
silent
sympathetic
elder
brother
fortunately
for
me
he
could
not
talk
at
all
but
he
was
an
admirable
listener
and
i
talked
to
him
by
the
hour
i
learned
the
instrument
of
speech
with
him
for
i
could
see
by
his
face
when
i
had
said
anything
extraordinary
he
did
not
praise
me
but
quickened
me
astonishingly
forced
me
always
to
do
better
than
my
best
an
intense
vivifying
influence
the
influence
of
greek
art
at
its
supremest
he
was
the
gamaliel
then
i
questioned
at
whose
feet
you
sat
oh
no
frank
he
chided
everyone
sat
at
my
feet
even
then
but
pater
was
a
very
great
man
dear
pater
i
remember
once
talking
to
him
when
we
were
seated
together
on
a
bench
under
some
trees
in
oxford
i
had
been
watching
the
students
bathing
in
the
river
the
beautiful
white
figures
all
grace
and
ease
and
virile
strength
i
had
been
pointing
out
how
christianity
had
flowered
into
romance
and
how
the
crude
hebraic
materialism
and
all
the
later
formalities
of
an
established
creed
had
fallen
away
from
the
tree
of
life
and
left
us
the
exquisite
ideals
of
the
new
paganism
the
pale
christ
had
been
outlived
his
renunciations
and
his
sympathies
were
mere
weaknesses
we
were
moving
to
a
synthesis
of
art
where
the
enchanting
perfume
of
romance
should
be
wedded
to
the
severe
beauty
of
classic
form
i
really
talked
as
if
inspired
and
when
i
paused
pater
the
stiff
quiet
silent
pater
suddenly
slipped
from
his
seat
and
knelt
down
by
me
and
kissed
my
hand
i
cried
must
not
you
really
must
not
what
would
people
think
if
they
saw
you
he
got
up
with
a
white
strained
face
had
to
he
muttered
glancing
about
him
fearfully
had
to
once
i
must
warn
my
readers
that
this
whole
incident
is
ripened
and
set
in
a
higher
key
of
thought
by
the
fact
that
oscar
told
it
more
than
ten
years
after
it
happened
chapter
iv
formative
influences
oscar
poems
the
most
important
event
in
oscar
early
life
happened
while
he
was
still
an
undergraduate
at
oxford
his
father
sir
william
wilde
died
in
leaving
to
his
wife
lady
wilde
nearly
all
he
possessed
some
the
interest
of
which
was
barely
enough
to
keep
her
in
genteel
poverty
the
sum
is
so
small
that
one
is
constrained
to
believe
the
report
that
sir
william
wilde
in
his
later
years
kept
practically
open
house
lashins
of
whisky
and
a
good
larder
and
was
besides
notorious
for
his
gallantries
oscar
small
portion
a
little
money
and
a
small
house
with
some
land
came
to
him
in
the
nick
of
time
he
used
the
cash
partly
to
pay
some
debts
at
oxford
partly
to
defray
the
expenses
of
a
trip
to
greece
it
was
natural
that
oscar
wilde
with
his
eager
receptivity
should
receive
the
best
academic
education
of
his
time
and
should
better
that
by
travel
we
all
get
something
like
the
education
we
desire
and
oscar
wilde
it
always
seemed
to
me
was
had
learned
that
is
too
much
from
books
and
not
enough
from
life
and
had
thought
too
little
for
himself
but
my
readers
will
be
able
to
judge
of
this
for
themselves
in
he
accompanied
professor
mahaffy
on
a
long
tour
through
greece
the
pleasure
and
profit
oscar
got
from
the
trip
were
so
great
that
he
failed
to
return
to
oxford
on
the
date
fixed
the
dons
fined
him
pounds
for
the
breach
of
discipline
but
they
returned
the
money
to
him
in
the
following
year
when
he
won
first
honours
in
greats
and
the
newdigate
prize
this
visit
to
greece
when
he
was
confirmed
the
view
of
life
which
he
had
already
formed
and
i
have
indicated
sufficiently
perhaps
in
that
talk
with
pater
already
recorded
but
no
one
will
understand
oscar
wilde
who
for
a
moment
loses
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
pagan
born
as
gautier
says
one
for
whom
the
visible
world
alone
exists
endowed
with
all
the
greek
sensuousness
and
love
of
plastic
beauty
a
pagan
like
nietzsche
and
gautier
wholly
out
of
sympathy
with
christianity
one
of
the
confraternity
of
the
faithless
who
can
not
believe
his
own
words
in
de
profundis
to
whom
a
sense
of
sin
and
repentance
are
symptoms
of
weakness
and
disease
oscar
used
often
to
say
that
the
chief
pleasure
he
had
in
visiting
rome
was
to
find
the
greek
gods
and
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
greek
story
throned
in
the
vatican
he
preferred
niobe
to
the
mater
dolorosa
and
helen
to
both
the
worship
of
sorrow
must
give
place
he
declared
to
the
worship
of
the
beautiful
another
dominant
characteristic
of
the
young
man
may
here
find
its
place
while
still
at
oxford
his
tastes
the
bent
of
his
mind
and
his
temperament
were
beginning
to
outline
his
future
he
spent
his
vacations
in
dublin
and
always
called
upon
his
old
school
friend
edward
sullivan
in
his
rooms
at
trinity
sullivan
relates
that
when
they
met
oscar
used
to
be
full
of
his
occasional
visits
to
london
and
could
talk
of
nothing
but
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
plays
and
players
from
youth
on
the
theatre
drew
him
irresistibly
he
had
not
only
all
the
vanity
of
the
actor
but
what
might
be
called
the
born
dramatist
love
for
the
varied
life
of
the
stage
its
paintings
costumings
rhetoric
and
above
all
the
touch
of
emphasis
natural
to
it
which
gives
such
opportunity
for
humorous
exaggeration
i
remember
him
telling
me
sullivan
writes
about
irving
which
made
a
great
impression
on
him
he
was
fascinated
by
it
he
feared
however
that
the
public
might
be
similarly
affected
a
thing
which
he
declared
would
destroy
his
enjoyment
of
an
extraordinary
performance
he
admired
miss
ellen
terry
too
extravagantly
as
he
admired
marion
terry
langtry
and
mary
anderson
later
the
death
of
sir
william
wilde
put
an
end
to
the
family
life
in
dublin
and
set
the
survivors
free
lady
wilde
had
lost
her
husband
and
her
only
daughter
in
merrion
square
the
house
was
full
of
sad
memories
to
her
she
was
eager
to
leave
it
all
and
settle
in
london
the
requiescat
in
oscar
first
book
of
poems
was
written
in
memory
of
this
sister
who
died
in
her
teens
whom
he
likened
to
a
ray
of
sunshine
dancing
about
the
house
he
took
his
vocation
seriously
even
in
youth
he
felt
that
he
should
sing
his
sorrow
give
record
of
whatever
happened
to
him
in
life
but
he
found
no
new
word
for
his
bereavement
willie
wilde
came
over
to
london
and
got
employment
as
a
journalist
and
was
soon
given
almost
a
free
hand
by
the
editor
of
the
society
paper
the
world
with
rare
unselfishness
or
if
you
will
with
celtic
clannishness
he
did
a
good
deal
to
make
oscar
name
known
every
clever
thing
that
oscar
said
or
that
could
be
attributed
to
him
willie
reported
in
the
world
this
puffing
and
oscar
own
uncommon
power
as
a
talker
but
chiefly
perhaps
a
whispered
reputation
for
strange
sins
had
thus
early
begun
to
form
a
sort
of
myth
around
him
he
was
already
on
the
way
to
becoming
a
personage
there
was
a
certain
curiosity
about
him
a
flutter
of
interest
in
whatever
he
did
he
had
published
poems
in
the
trinity
college
magazine
kottabos
and
elsewhere
people
were
beginning
to
take
him
at
his
own
valuation
as
a
poet
and
a
wit
and
the
more
readily
as
that
ambition
did
not
clash
in
any
way
with
their
more
material
strivings
the
time
had
now
come
for
oscar
to
conquer
london
as
he
had
conquered
oxford
he
had
finished
the
first
class
in
the
great
and
was
eager
to
try
the
next
where
his
mistakes
would
be
his
only
tutors
and
his
desires
his
taskmasters
his
university
successes
flattered
him
with
the
belief
that
he
would
go
from
triumph
to
triumph
and
be
the
exception
proving
the
rule
that
the
victor
in
the
academic
lists
seldom
repeats
his
victories
on
the
battlefield
of
life
it
is
not
sufficiently
understood
that
the
learning
of
latin
and
greek
and
the
forming
of
expensive
habits
at
others
cost
are
a
positive
disability
and
handicap
in
the
tussle
of
the
great
city
where
greed
and
unscrupulous
resolution
rule
and
where
there
are
few
prizes
for
feats
of
memory
or
taste
in
words
when
the
graduate
wins
in
life
he
wins
as
a
rule
in
spite
of
his
education
and
not
because
of
it
it
is
true
that
the
majority
of
english
men
give
themselves
an
infinitely
better
education
than
that
provided
by
the
authorities
they
devote
themselves
to
athletic
sports
with
enthusiasm
fortunately
for
them
it
is
impossible
to
develop
the
body
without
at
the
same
time
steeling
the
will
the
athlete
has
to
live
laborious
days
he
may
not
eat
to
his
liking
nor
drink
to
his
thirst
he
learns
deep
lessons
almost
unconsciously
to
conquer
his
desires
and
make
light
of
pain
and
discomfort
he
needs
no
aristotle
to
teach
him
the
value
of
habits
he
is
soon
forced
to
use
them
as
defences
against
his
pet
weaknesses
above
all
he
finds
that
has
its
reward
in
perfect
health
that
the
thistle
pain
too
has
its
flower
it
is
a
truism
that
athletes
generally
succeed
in
life
spartan
discipline
proving
itself
incomparably
superior
to
greek
accidence
oscar
wilde
knew
nothing
of
this
discipline
he
had
never
trained
his
body
to
endure
or
his
will
to
steadfastness
he
was
the
perfect
flower
of
academic
study
and
leisure
at
magdalen
he
had
been
taught
luxurious
living
the
delight
of
gratifying
expensive
tastes
he
had
been
brought
up
and
enervated
so
to
speak
in
capua
his
vanity
had
been
with
cloistered
triumphs
he
was
at
once
vainly
and
weak
he
had
been
encouraged
for
years
to
give
way
to
his
emotions
and
to
pamper
his
sensations
and
as
the
of
folly
to
cherish
a
fantastic
code
of
honour
even
in
mortal
combat
while
despising
the
religion
which
might
have
given
him
some
hold
on
the
respect
of
his
compatriots
what
chance
had
this
cultured
sybarite
in
the
deadly
grapple
of
modern
life
where
the
first
quality
is
will
power
the
only
knowledge
needed
a
knowledge
of
the
value
of
money
i
must
not
be
understood
here
as
in
any
degree
disparaging
oscar
i
can
surely
state
that
a
flower
is
weaker
than
a
weed
without
exalting
the
weed
or
depreciating
the
flower
the
first
part
of
life
voyage
was
over
for
oscar
wilde
let
us
try
to
see
him
as
he
saw
himself
at
this
time
and
let
us
also
determine
his
true
relations
to
the
world
fortunately
he
has
given
us
his
own
view
of
himself
with
some
care
in
foster
alumni
oxonienses
oscar
wilde
described
himself
on
leaving
oxford
as
a
professor
of
aesthetics
and
a
critic
of
art
an
announcement
to
me
at
once
infinitely
ludicrous
and
pathetic
ludicrous
because
it
betrays
such
complete
ignorance
of
life
all
given
over
to
men
industrious
with
gadarene
swine
as
carlyle
called
them
busily
grubbing
and
grunting
in
search
of
pignuts
pathetic
for
it
is
boldly
ingenuous
as
youth
itself
with
a
touch
of
youthful
conceit
and
exaggeration
another
eager
human
soul
on
the
threshold
longing
to
find
some
suitable
high
work
in
the
world
all
unwitting
of
the
fact
that
ideal
strivings
are
everywhere
despised
and
discouraged
cottages
for
the
million
being
the
day
demand
and
not
oratories
or
palaces
of
art
or
temples
for
the
spirit
not
the
time
for
a
professor
of
aesthetics
one
would
say
and
assuredly
not
the
place
one
wonders
whether
zululand
would
not
be
more
favourable
for
such
a
man
than
england
germany
france
and
italy
have
many
positions
in
universities
museums
opera
houses
for
lovers
of
the
beautiful
and
above
all
an
educated
respect
for
artists
and
writers
just
as
they
have
places
too
for
servants
of
truth
in
chemical
laboratories
and
polytechnics
endowed
by
the
state
with
excellent
results
even
from
the
utilitarian
point
of
view
but
rich
england
has
only
a
few
dozen
such
places
in
all
at
command
and
these
are
usually
allotted
with
a
cynical
contempt
for
merit
miserable
anarchic
england
amid
its
creature
comforts
proving
now
by
way
of
example
to
helots
that
man
can
not
live
by
bread
alone
england
and
oscar
wilde
the
black
country
and
the
professor
of
aesthetics
a
mad
world
my
masters
it
is
necessary
for
us
now
to
face
this
mournful
truth
that
in
the
quarrel
between
these
two
the
faults
were
not
all
on
one
side
mayhap
england
was
even
further
removed
from
the
ideal
than
the
professor
of
aesthetics
which
fact
may
well
give
us
pause
and
food
for
thought
organic
progress
we
have
been
told
indeed
might
have
seen
if
we
had
eyes
evolution
is
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
our
rulers
therefore
should
have
provided
for
the
complexity
of
modern
life
and
modern
men
the
good
gardener
will
even
make
it
his
ambition
to
produce
new
species
our
politicians
however
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
give
even
the
new
species
that
appear
a
chance
of
living
they
are
too
busy
it
appears
in
keeping
their
jobs
no
new
profession
has
been
organized
in
england
since
the
middle
ages
in
the
meantime
we
have
invented
new
arts
new
sciences
and
new
letters
when
will
these
be
organized
and
regimented
in
new
and
living
professions
so
that
young
ingenuous
souls
may
find
suitable
fields
for
their
powers
and
may
not
be
forced
to
grub
for
pignuts
when
it
would
be
more
profitable
for
them
and
for
us
to
use
their
nobler
faculties
not
only
are
the
poor
poorer
and
more
numerous
in
england
than
elsewhere
but
there
is
less
provision
made
for
the
intellectuals
too
consequently
the
organism
is
suffering
at
both
extremities
it
is
high
time
that
both
maladies
were
taken
in
hand
for
by
universal
consent
england
is
now
about
the
worst
organized
of
all
modern
states
the
furthest
from
the
ideal
something
too
should
be
done
with
the
existing
professions
to
make
them
worthy
of
honourable
ambition
one
of
them
the
church
is
a
noble
body
without
a
soul
the
soul
our
nostrils
tell
us
died
some
time
ago
while
the
medical
profession
has
got
a
noble
spirit
with
a
wretched
body
it
says
much
for
the
inherent
integrity
and
piety
of
human
nature
that
our
doctors
persist
in
trying
to
cure
diseases
when
it
is
clearly
to
their
to
keep
their
patients
ailing
an
anarchic
world
this
english
one
and
stupefied
with
what
will
this
professor
of
aesthetics
make
of
it
here
he
is
the
flower
of
english
university
training
a
winner
of
some
of
the
chief
academic
prizes
without
any
worthy
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
save
perchance
by
journalism
and
journalism
in
england
suffers
from
the
prevailing
anarchy
in
france
italy
and
germany
journalism
is
a
career
in
which
an
eloquent
and
cultured
youth
may
honourably
win
his
spurs
in
many
countries
this
way
of
earning
one
bread
can
still
be
turned
into
an
art
by
the
gifted
and
but
in
england
thanks
in
the
main
to
the
anonymity
of
the
press
cunningly
contrived
by
the
capitalist
the
journalist
or
modern
preacher
is
turned
into
a
venal
voice
a
soulless
cheapjack
paid
to
puff
his
master
wares
clearly
our
professor
of
aesthetics
and
critic
of
art
is
likely
to
have
a
doleful
time
of
it
in
nineteenth
century
london
oscar
had
already
dipped
into
his
little
patrimony
as
we
have
seen
and
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
he
would
soon
have
to
live
on
what
he
could
earn
a
few
pounds
a
week
but
then
he
was
a
poet
and
had
boundless
confidence
in
his
own
ability
to
the
artist
nature
the
present
is
everything
just
for
he
resolved
that
he
would
live
as
he
had
always
lived
so
he
travelled
first
class
to
london
and
bought
all
the
books
and
papers
that
could
distract
him
on
the
way
give
me
the
luxuries
he
used
to
say
and
anyone
can
have
the
necessaries
in
the
background
of
his
mind
there
were
serious
misgivings
long
afterwards
he
told
me
that
his
father
death
and
the
smallness
of
his
patrimony
had
been
a
heavy
blow
to
him
he
encouraged
himself
however
at
the
moment
by
dwelling
on
his
brother
comparative
success
and
waved
aside
fears
and
doubts
as
unworthy
it
is
to
his
credit
that
at
first
he
tried
to
cut
down
expenses
and
live
laborious
days
he
took
a
couple
of
furnished
rooms
in
salisbury
street
off
the
strand
a
very
grub
street
for
a
man
of
fashion
and
began
to
work
at
journalism
while
getting
together
a
book
of
poems
for
publication
his
journalism
at
first
was
anything
but
successful
it
was
his
misfortune
to
appeal
only
to
the
best
heads
and
good
heads
are
not
numerous
anywhere
his
appeal
too
was
still
academic
and
laboured
his
brother
willie
with
his
commoner
sympathies
appeared
to
be
better
equipped
for
this
work
but
oscar
had
from
the
first
a
certain
social
success
as
soon
as
he
reached
london
he
stepped
boldly
into
the
limelight
going
to
all
first
nights
and
taking
the
floor
on
all
occasions
he
was
not
only
an
admirable
talker
but
he
was
invariably
smiling
eager
full
of
life
and
the
joy
of
living
and
above
all
given
to
unmeasured
praise
of
whatever
and
whoever
pleased
him
this
gift
of
enthusiastic
admiration
was
not
only
his
most
engaging
characteristic
but
also
perhaps
the
chief
proof
of
his
extraordinary
ability
it
was
certainly
too
the
quality
which
served
him
best
all
through
his
life
he
went
about
declaring
that
langtry
was
more
beautiful
than
the
of
milo
and
lady
archie
campbell
more
charming
than
rosalind
and
whistler
an
incomparable
artist
such
enthusiasm
in
a
young
and
brilliant
man
was
unexpected
and
delightful
and
doors
were
thrown
open
to
him
in
all
sets
those
who
praise
passionately
are
generally
welcome
guests
and
if
oscar
could
not
praise
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
kept
silent
scarcely
a
bitter
word
ever
fell
from
those
smiling
lips
no
tactics
could
have
been
more
successful
in
england
than
his
native
gift
of
radiant
and
enthusiasm
he
got
to
know
not
only
all
the
actors
and
actresses
but
the
chief
patrons
and
frequenters
of
the
theatre
lord
lytton
lady
shrewsbury
lady
dorothy
nevill
lady
de
grey
and
jeune
and
on
the
other
hand
hardy
meredith
browning
swinburne
and
matthew
arnold
all
bohemia
in
fact
and
all
that
part
of
mayfair
which
cares
for
the
things
of
the
intellect
but
though
he
went
out
a
great
deal
and
met
a
great
many
distinguished
people
and
won
a
certain
popularity
his
social
success
put
no
money
in
his
purse
it
even
forced
him
to
spend
money
for
the
constant
applause
of
his
hearers
gave
him
he
began
to
talk
more
and
write
less
and
cabs
and
gloves
and
flowers
cost
money
he
was
soon
compelled
to
mortgage
his
little
property
in
ireland
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
he
was
still
indefatigably
intent
on
bettering
his
mind
and
in
london
he
found
more
original
teachers
than
in
oxford
notably
morris
and
whistler
morris
though
greatly
overpraised
during
his
life
had
hardly
any
message
for
the
men
of
his
time
he
went
for
his
ideals
to
an
imaginary
past
and
what
he
taught
and
praised
was
often
totally
unsuited
to
modern
conditions
whistler
on
the
other
hand
was
a
modern
of
the
moderns
and
a
great
artist
to
boot
he
had
not
only
assimilated
all
the
newest
thought
of
the
day
but
with
the
alchemy
of
genius
had
transmuted
it
and
made
it
his
own
before
even
the
de
goncourts
he
had
admired
chinese
porcelain
and
japanese
prints
and
his
own
exquisite
intuition
strengthened
by
japanese
example
had
shown
him
that
his
impression
of
life
was
more
valuable
than
any
mere
transcript
of
it
modern
art
he
felt
should
be
an
interpretation
and
not
a
representment
of
reality
and
he
taught
the
golden
rule
of
the
artist
that
the
half
is
usually
more
expressive
than
the
whole
he
went
about
london
preaching
new
schemes
of
decoration
and
another
renaissance
of
art
had
he
only
been
a
painter
he
would
never
have
exercised
an
extraordinary
influence
but
he
was
a
singularly
interesting
appearance
as
well
and
an
admirable
talker
gifted
with
picturesque
phrases
and
a
most
caustic
wit
oscar
sat
at
his
feet
and
imbibed
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
new
aesthetic
gospel
he
even
ventured
to
annex
some
of
the
master
most
telling
stories
and
thus
came
into
conflict
with
his
teacher
one
incident
may
find
a
place
here
the
art
critic
of
the
times
humphry
ward
had
come
to
see
an
exhibition
of
whistler
pictures
filled
with
an
undue
sense
of
his
own
importance
he
buttonholed
the
master
and
pointing
to
one
picture
said
that
good
a
lovely
bit
of
colour
but
that
you
know
he
went
on
jerking
his
finger
over
his
shoulder
at
another
picture
that
bad
drawing
all
wrong
bad
my
dear
fellow
cried
whistler
you
must
never
say
that
this
painting
good
or
that
bad
never
good
and
bad
are
not
terms
to
be
used
by
you
but
say
i
like
this
and
i
dislike
that
and
you
be
within
your
right
and
now
come
and
have
a
whiskey
for
you
sure
to
like
that
carried
away
by
the
witty
fling
oscar
cried
i
wish
i
had
said
that
you
will
oscar
you
will
came
whistler
lightning
thrust
of
all
the
personal
influences
which
went
to
the
moulding
of
oscar
talent
that
of
whistler
in
my
opinion
was
the
most
important
whistler
taught
him
that
men
of
genius
stand
apart
and
are
laws
unto
themselves
showed
him
too
that
all
qualities
singularity
of
appearance
wit
rudeness
even
count
doubly
in
a
democracy
but
neither
his
own
talent
nor
the
bold
learned
from
whistler
helped
him
to
earn
money
the
conquest
of
london
seemed
further
off
and
more
improbable
than
ever
where
whistler
had
missed
the
laurel
how
could
he
or
indeed
anyone
be
sure
of
winning
a
weaker
professor
of
aesthetics
would
have
been
discouraged
by
the
monetary
and
other
difficulties
of
his
position
and
would
have
lost
heart
at
the
outset
in
front
of
the
impenetrable
blank
wall
of
english
philistinism
and
contempt
but
oscar
wilde
was
conscious
of
great
ability
and
was
driven
by
an
inordinate
vanity
instead
of
diminishing
his
pretensions
in
the
face
of
opposition
he
increased
them
he
began
to
go
abroad
in
the
evening
in
knee
breeches
and
silk
stockings
wearing
strange
flowers
in
his
coat
green
cornflowers
and
gilded
lilies
while
talking
about
baudelaire
whose
name
even
was
unfamiliar
as
a
world
poet
and
proclaiming
the
strange
creed
that
nothing
succeeds
like
excess
very
soon
his
name
came
into
everyone
mouth
london
talked
of
him
and
discussed
him
at
a
thousand
for
one
invitation
he
had
received
before
a
dozen
now
poured
in
he
became
a
celebrity
of
course
he
was
still
sneered
at
by
many
as
a
mere
poseur
it
still
seemed
to
be
all
lombard
street
to
a
china
orange
that
he
would
be
beaten
down
under
the
myriad
trampling
feet
of
indifference
and
disdain
some
circumstances
were
in
his
favour
though
the
artistic
movement
inaugurated
years
before
by
the
was
still
laughed
at
and
scorned
by
the
many
as
a
craze
a
few
had
stood
firm
and
slowly
the
steadfast
minority
had
begun
to
sway
the
majority
as
is
often
the
case
in
democracies
oscar
wilde
profited
by
the
victory
of
these
forerunners
here
and
there
among
the
indifferent
public
men
were
attracted
by
the
artistic
view
of
life
and
women
by
the
emotional
intensity
of
the
new
creed
oscar
wilde
became
the
prophet
of
an
esoteric
cult
but
notoriety
even
did
not
solve
the
monetary
question
which
grew
more
and
more
insistent
a
dozen
times
he
waved
it
aside
and
went
into
debt
rather
than
restrain
himself
somehow
or
other
he
would
fall
on
his
feet
he
thought
men
who
console
themselves
in
this
way
usually
fall
on
someone
else
feet
and
so
did
oscar
wilde
at
years
of
age
and
curiously
enough
at
the
very
moment
of
his
challenge
of
the
world
with
fantastic
dress
he
stooped
to
ask
his
mother
for
money
money
which
she
could
ill
spare
though
to
do
her
justice
she
never
wasted
a
second
thought
on
money
where
her
affections
were
concerned
and
she
not
only
loved
oscar
but
was
proud
of
him
still
she
could
not
give
him
much
the
difficulty
was
only
postponed
what
was
to
be
done
his
vanity
had
grown
with
his
growth
the
dread
of
defeat
was
only
a
spur
to
the
society
favourite
he
cast
about
for
some
means
of
conquering
the
philistines
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
book
of
poems
he
had
been
trying
off
and
on
for
nearly
a
year
to
get
it
published
the
publishers
told
him
roundly
that
there
was
no
money
in
poetry
and
refused
the
risk
but
the
notoriety
of
his
and
silken
hose
and
above
all
the
continual
attacks
in
the
society
papers
came
to
his
aid
and
his
book
appeared
in
the
early
summer
of
with
all
the
importance
that
imposing
form
good
paper
broad
margins
and
high
price
could
give
it
the
truth
was
he
paid
for
the
printing
and
production
of
the
book
himself
and
david
bogue
the
publisher
put
his
name
on
for
a
commission
oscar
had
built
high
fantastic
hopes
on
this
book
to
the
very
end
of
his
life
he
believed
himself
a
poet
and
in
the
creative
sense
of
the
word
he
was
assuredly
justified
but
he
meant
it
in
the
singing
sense
as
well
and
there
his
claim
can
only
be
admitted
with
serious
qualifications
but
whether
he
was
a
singer
or
not
the
hopes
founded
on
this
book
were
extravagant
he
expected
to
make
not
only
reputation
by
it
but
a
large
amount
of
money
and
money
is
not
often
made
in
england
by
poetry
the
book
had
an
extraordinary
success
greater
it
may
safely
be
said
than
any
first
book
of
real
poetry
has
ever
had
in
england
or
indeed
is
ever
likely
to
have
four
editions
were
sold
in
a
few
weeks
two
of
the
sonnets
in
the
book
were
addressed
to
ellen
terry
one
as
portia
the
other
as
henrietta
maria
and
these
partly
account
for
the
book
popularity
for
miss
terry
was
delighted
with
them
and
praised
the
book
and
its
author
to
the
skies
in
her
recollections
miss
terry
says
that
she
was
more
impressed
by
the
genius
of
oscar
wilde
and
of
whistler
than
by
that
of
any
other
men
i
reproduce
the
henrietta
maria
sonnet
here
as
a
fair
specimen
of
the
work
queen
henrietta
maria
in
the
lone
tent
waiting
for
victory
she
stands
with
eyes
marred
by
the
mists
of
pain
like
some
wan
lily
overdrenched
with
rain
the
clamorous
clang
of
arms
the
ensanguined
sky
war
ruin
and
the
wreck
of
chivalry
to
her
proud
soul
no
common
fear
can
bring
bravely
she
tarrieth
for
her
lord
the
king
her
soul
aflame
with
passionate
ecstasy
o
hair
of
gold
o
crimson
lips
o
face
made
for
the
luring
and
the
love
of
man
with
thee
i
do
forget
the
toil
and
stress
the
loveless
road
that
knows
no
time
straitened
pulse
the

dread

my
freedom

my
life
republican
lyric
poetry
is
by
its
excellence
the
chief
art
of
england
as
music
is
the
art
of
germany
a
book
of
poetry
is
almost
sure
of
fair
appreciation
in
the
english
press
which
does
not
trouble
to
notice
a
sartor
resartus
or
the
first
essays
of
an
emerson
the
excessive
consideration
given
to
oscar
book
by
the
critics
showed
that
already
his
personality
and
social
success
had
affected
the
reporters
the
athenaeum
gave
the
book
the
place
of
honour
in
its
number
for
the
of
july
the
review
was
severe
but
not
unjust
wilde
volume
of
poems
it
says
may
be
regarded
as
the
evangel
of
a
new
creed
from
other
gospels
it
differs
in
coming
after
instead
of
before
the
cult
it
seeks
to
establish
we
fail
to
see
however
that
the
apostle
of
the
new
worship
has
any
distinct
message
the
critic
then
took
pains
to
prove
that
nearly
all
the
book
is
imitative
and
concluded
work
of
this
nature
has
no
element
of
endurance
the
saturday
review
dismissed
the
book
at
the
end
of
an
article
on
recent
poetry
as
neither
good
nor
bad
the
reviewer
objected
in
the
english
fashion
to
the
sensual
tone
of
the
poems
but
summed
up
fairly
enough
this
book
is
not
without
traces
of
cleverness
but
it
is
marred
everywhere
by
imitation
insincerity
and
bad
taste
at
the
same
time
the
notices
in
punch
were
extravagantly
bitter
while
of
course
the
notices
in
the
world
mainly
written
by
oscar
brother
were
extravagantly
eulogistic
punch
declared
that
wilde
may
be
aesthetic
but
he
is
not
original
a
volume
of
echoes
swinburne
and
water
now
what
did
the
athenaeum
mean
by
taking
a
new
book
of
imitative
verse
so
seriously
and
talking
of
it
as
the
evangel
of
a
new
creed
besides
suggesting
that
it
comes
after
the
cult
and
so
forth
it
seems
probable
that
the
athenaeum
mistook
oscar
wilde
for
a
continuator
of
the
movement
with
the
and
peculiarly
english
suggestion
that
whatever
is
aesthetic
or
artistic
is
necessarily
weak
and
worthless
if
not
worse
soon
after
oscar
left
oxford
punch
began
to
caricature
him
and
ridicule
the
cult
of
what
it
christened
the
too
utterly
utter
nine
englishmen
out
of
ten
took
delight
in
the
savage
contempt
poured
upon
what
was
known
euphemistically
as
the
aesthetic
craze
by
the
pet
organ
of
the
english
middle
class
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
punch
published
under
the
title
of
a
poet
day
oscar
at
breakfast
oscar
at
luncheon
oscar
at
dinner
oscar
at
supper
see
i
am
after
all
mortal
remarked
the
poet
with
an
ineffable
affable
smile
as
he
looked
up
from
an
elegant
but
substantial
dish
of
ham
and
eggs
passing
a
long
willowy
hand
through
his
waving
hair
he
swept
away
a
stray
with
the
nonchalance
of
a
after
this
effort
wilde
expressed
himself
as
feeling
somewhat
faint
and
with
a
half
apologetic
smile
ordered
another
portion
of
ham
and
eggs
punch
verses
on
the
subject
were
of
the
same
sort
showing
spite
rather
than
humour
under
the
heading
of
sage
green
by
a
aesthete
it
published
such
stuff
as
this
my
love
is
as
fair
as
a
lily
flower
the
peacock
blue
has
a
sacred
sheen
oh
bright
are
the
blooms
in
her
maiden
bower
sing
hey
sing
ho
for
the
sweet
sage
green
and
woe
is
me
that
i
never
may
win
the
peacock

a
sacred
sheen
for
the
bard
hard
up
and
she
got
no
tin
sing
hey
sing
ho
for
the
sweet
sage
green
taking
the
criticism
as
a
whole
it
would
be
useless
to
deny
that
there
is
an
underlying
assumption
of
vicious
sensuality
in
the
poet
which
is
believed
to
be
reflected
in
the
poetry
this
is
the
only
way
to
explain
the
condemnation
which
is
much
more
bitter
than
the
verse
deserves
the
poems
gave
oscar
pocket
money
for
a
season
increased
too
his
notoriety
but
did
him
little
or
no
good
with
the
judicious
there
was
not
a
memorable
word
or
a
new
cadence
or
a
sincere
cry
in
the
book
still
first
volumes
of
poetry
are
as
a
rule
imitative
and
the
attempt
if
inferior
to
venus
and
adonis
was
not
without
interest
oscar
was
naturally
disappointed
with
the
criticism
but
the
sales
encouraged
him
and
the
stir
the
book
made
and
he
was
as
determined
as
ever
to
succeed
what
was
to
be
done
next
chapter
v
oscar
quarrel
with
whistler
and
marriage
the
first
round
in
the
battle
with
fate
was
inconclusive
oscar
wilde
had
managed
to
get
known
and
talked
about
and
had
kept
his
head
above
water
for
a
couple
of
years
while
learning
something
about
life
and
more
about
himself
on
the
other
hand
he
had
spent
almost
all
his
patrimony
had
run
into
some
debt
besides
yet
seemed
as
far
as
ever
from
earning
a
decent
living
the
outlook
was
disquieting
even
as
a
young
man
oscar
had
a
very
considerable
understanding
of
life
he
could
not
make
his
way
as
a
journalist
the
english
did
not
care
for
his
poetry
but
there
was
still
the
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
could
talk
better
than
he
wrote
he
got
his
brother
to
announce
boldly
in
the
world
that
owing
to
the
astonishing
success
of
his
oscar
wilde
had
been
invited
to
lecture
in
america
the
invitation
was
imaginary
but
oscar
had
resolved
to
break
into
this
new
field
there
was
money
in
it
he
felt
sure
besides
he
had
another
string
to
his
bow
when
the
first
rumblings
of
the
social
storm
in
russia
reached
england
our
aristocratic
republican
seized
occasion
by
the
forelock
and
wrote
a
play
on
the
nihilist
conspiracy
called
vera
this
drama
was
impregnated
with
popular
english
liberal
sentiment
with
the
interest
of
actuality
about
it
vera
was
published
in
september
but
fell
flat
the
assassination
of
the
tsar
alexander
however
in
march
the
way
oscar
poems
published
in
june
of
that
year
were
taken
up
by
miss
terry
and
puffed
in
the
press
induced
bernard
beere
an
actress
of
some
merit
to
accept
vera
for
the
stage
it
was
suddenly
announced
that
vera
would
be
put
on
by
bernard
beere
at
the
adelphi
in
december
but
the
author
had
to
be
content
with
this
advertisement
december
came
and
went
and
vera
was
not
staged
it
seemed
probable
to
oscar
that
it
might
be
accepted
in
america
at
any
rate
there
could
be
no
harm
in
trying
he
sailed
for
new
york
it
was
on
the
cards
that
he
might
succeed
in
his
new
adventure
the
taste
of
america
in
letters
and
art
is
still
strongly
influenced
if
not
formed
by
english
taste
and
if
oscar
wilde
had
been
properly
accredited
it
is
probable
that
his
extraordinary
gift
of
speech
would
have
won
him
success
in
america
as
a
lecturer
his
phrase
to
the
revenue
officers
on
landing
i
have
nothing
to
declare
except
my
genius
turned
the
limelight
full
upon
him
and
excited
comment
and
discussion
all
over
the
country
but
the
fuglemen
of
his
caste
whose
praise
had
brought
him
to
the
front
in
england
were
almost
unrepresented
in
the
states
and
never
bold
enough
to
be
partisans
oscar
faced
the
american
philistine
public
without
his
accustomed
claque
and
under
these
circumstances
a
was
evidence
of
considerable
power
his
subjects
were
the
english
renaissance
and
house
decoration
his
first
lecture
at
chickering
hall
on
january
was
so
much
talked
about
that
the
famous
impresario
major
pond
engaged
him
for
a
tour
which
however
had
to
be
cut
short
in
the
middle
as
a
monetary
failure
the
nation
gave
a
very
fair
account
of
his
first
lecture
wilde
is
essentially
a
foreign
product
and
can
hardly
succeed
in
this
country
what
he
has
to
say
is
not
new
and
his
extravagance
is
not
extravagant
enough
to
amuse
the
average
american
audience
his
and
long
hair
are
good
as
far
as
they
go
but
bunthorne
has
really
spoiled
the
public
for
wilde
the
nation
underrated
american
curiosity
oscar
lectured
some
ninety
times
from
january
till
july
when
he
returned
to
new
york
the
gross
receipts
amounted
to
some
he
received
about
which
left
him
with
a
few
hundreds
above
his
expenses
his
optimism
regarded
this
as
a
triumph
one
is
fain
to
confess
today
that
these
lectures
make
very
poor
reading
there
is
not
a
new
thought
in
them
not
even
a
memorable
expression
they
are
nothing
but
student
work
the
best
passages
in
them
being
mere
paraphrases
of
pater
and
arnold
though
the
titles
were
borrowed
from
whistler
ernest
bendz
in
his
monograph
on
the
influence
of
pater
and
matthew
arnold
in
the
of
oscar
wilde
has
established
this
fact
with
curious
erudition
and
completeness
still
the
lecturer
was
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
his
and
silk
stockings
set
all
the
women
talking
and
he
spoke
with
suave
authority
even
the
dullest
had
to
admit
that
his
elocution
was
excellent
and
the
manner
of
speech
is
keenly
appreciated
in
america
in
some
of
the
eastern
towns
in
new
york
especially
he
had
a
certain
success
the
success
of
sensation
and
of
novelty
such
success
as
every
large
capital
gives
to
the
strange
and
eccentric
in
boston
he
scored
a
triumph
of
character
fifty
or
sixty
harvard
students
came
to
his
lecture
dressed
to
caricature
him
in
swallow
tail
coats
knee
breeches
flowing
wigs
and
green
ties
they
all
wore
large
lilies
in
their
buttonholes
and
each
man
carried
a
huge
sunflower
as
he
limped
along
that
evening
oscar
appeared
in
ordinary
dress
and
went
on
with
his
lecture
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
the
rudeness
the
chief
boston
paper
gave
him
due
credit
everyone
who
witnessed
the
scene
on
tuesday
evening
must
feel
about
it
very
much
as
we
do
and
those
who
came
to
scoff
if
they
did
not
exactly
remain
to
pray
at
least
left
the
music
hall
with
feelings
of
cordial
liking
and
perhaps
to
their
own
surprise
of
respect
for
oscar
wilde
by
way
of
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
the
students
heads
oscar
presented
a
cast
of
the
hermes
then
recently
unearthed
to
the
university
of
harvard
as
he
travelled
west
to
louisville
and
omaha
his
popularity
dwined
and
dwindled
still
he
persevered
and
after
leaving
the
states
visited
canada
reaching
halifax
in
the
autumn
one
incident
must
find
a
place
here
on
september
he
sent
to
lady
wilde
i
have
been
told
that
this
was
merely
a
return
of
money
she
had
advanced
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
oscar
unlike
his
brother
willie
helped
his
mother
again
and
again
most
generously
though
willie
was
always
her
favourite
oscar
returned
to
england
in
april
and
lectured
to
the
art
students
at
their
club
in
golden
square
this
at
once
brought
about
a
break
with
whistler
who
accused
him
of
plagiarism
picking
from
our
platters
the
plums
for
the
puddings
he
peddles
in
the
provinces
if
one
compares
this
lecture
with
oscar
on
the
english
renaissance
of
art
delivered
in
new
york
only
a
year
before
and
with
whistler
opinions
it
is
impossible
not
to
admit
that
the
charge
was
justified
such
phrases
as
artists
are
not
to
copy
beauty
but
to
create
it
a
picture
is
a
purely
decorative
thing
proclaim
their
author
the
long
newspaper
wrangle
between
the
two
was
brought
to
a
head
in
when
whistler
gave
his
famous
ten
discourse
on
art
this
lecture
was
infinitely
better
than
any
of
oscar
wilde
twenty
odd
years
older
than
wilde
whistler
was
a
master
of
all
his
resources
he
was
not
only
witty
but
he
had
new
views
on
art
and
original
ideas
as
a
great
artist
he
knew
that
there
never
was
an
artistic
period
there
never
was
an
nation
again
and
again
he
reached
pure
beauty
of
expression
the
masterly
persiflage
too
filled
me
with
admiration
and
i
declared
that
the
lecture
ranked
with
the
best
ever
heard
in
london
with
coleridge
on
shakespeare
and
carlyle
on
heroes
to
my
astonishment
oscar
would
not
admit
the
superlative
quality
of
talk
he
thought
the
message
paradoxical
and
the
ridicule
of
the
professors
too
bitter
whistler
like
a
wasp
he
cried
and
carries
about
with
him
a
poisoned
sting
oscar
kindly
sweet
nature
revolted
against
the
disdainful
aggressiveness
of
whistler
attitude
besides
in
essence
whistler
lecture
was
an
attack
on
the
academic
theory
taught
in
the
universities
and
defended
naturally
by
a
young
scholar
like
oscar
wilde
whistler
view
that
the
artist
was
sporadic
a
happy
chance
a
sport
in
fact
was
a
new
view
and
oscar
had
not
yet
reached
this
level
he
reviewed
the
master
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
a
review
remarkable
for
one
of
the
earliest
gleams
of
that
genial
humour
which
later
became
his
most
characteristic
gift
whistler
he
said
is
indeed
one
of
the
very
greatest
masters
of
painting
in
my
opinion
and
i
may
add
that
in
this
opinion
whistler
himself
entirely
concurs
whistler
retorted
in
the
world
and
oscar
replied
but
whistler
had
the
best
of
the
argument
oscar
the
amiable
irresponsible
esurient
oscar
with
no
more
sense
of
a
picture
than
of
the
fit
of
a
coat
has
the
courage
of
the
opinions
of
others
it
should
be
noted
here
that
one
of
the
bitterest
of
tongues
could
not
help
doing
homage
to
oscar
wilde
amiability
whistler
even
preferred
to
call
him
amiable
and
irresponsible
rather
than
give
his
plagiarism
a
harsher
attribute
oscar
wilde
learned
almost
all
he
knew
of
art
confer
appendix
criticisms
by
robert
ross
and
of
controversy
from
whistler
but
he
was
never
more
than
a
pupil
in
either
field
for
controversy
in
especial
he
was
poorly
equipped
he
had
neither
the
courage
nor
the
contempt
nor
the
joy
in
conflict
of
his
great
exemplar
unperturbed
by
whistler
attacks
oscar
went
on
lecturing
about
the
country
on
personal
impressions
of
america
and
in
august
crossed
again
to
new
york
to
see
his
play
vera
produced
by
marie
prescott
at
the
union
square
theatre
it
was
a
complete
failure
as
might
have
been
expected
the
serious
part
of
it
was
such
as
any
talented
young
man
might
have
written
nevertheless
i
find
in
this
play
for
the
first
time
a
characteristic
gleam
of
humour
an
unexpected
flirt
of
wing
so
to
speak
which
in
view
of
the
future
is
full
of
promise
at
the
time
it
passed
unappreciated
september
saw
oscar
again
in
england
the
platform
gave
him
better
results
than
the
theatre
but
not
enough
for
freedom
or
ease
it
is
the
more
to
his
credit
that
as
soon
as
he
got
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
ahead
he
resolved
to
spend
it
in
bettering
his
mind
his
longing
for
wider
culture
and
perhaps
in
part
the
example
of
whistler
drove
him
to
paris
he
put
up
at
the
little
provincial
hotel
voltaire
on
the
quai
voltaire
and
quickly
made
acquaintance
with
everyone
of
note
in
the
world
of
letters
from
victor
hugo
to
paul
bourget
he
admired
verlaine
genius
to
the
full
but
the
grotesque
physical
ugliness
of
the
man
himself
verlaine
was
like
a
masque
of
socrates
and
his
sordid
and
unclean
way
of
living
prevented
oscar
from
really
getting
to
know
him
during
this
stay
in
paris
oscar
read
enormously
and
his
french
which
had
been
schoolboyish
became
quite
good
he
always
said
that
balzac
and
especially
his
poet
lucien
de
rubempre
had
been
his
teachers
while
in
paris
he
completed
his
play
the
duchess
of
padua
and
sent
it
to
miss
mary
anderson
in
america
who
refused
it
although
she
had
commissioned
him
he
always
said
to
write
it
it
seems
to
me
inferior
even
to
vera
in
interest
more
academic
and
further
from
life
and
when
produced
in
new
york
in
it
was
a
complete
frost
in
a
few
months
oscar
wilde
had
spent
his
money
and
had
skimmed
the
cream
from
paris
as
he
thought
accordingly
he
returned
to
london
and
took
rooms
again
this
time
in
charles
street
mayfair
he
had
learned
some
rude
lessons
in
the
years
since
leaving
oxford
and
the
first
and
most
impressive
lesson
was
the
fear
of
poverty
yet
his
taking
rooms
in
the
fashionable
part
of
town
showed
that
he
was
more
determined
than
ever
to
rise
and
not
to
sink
it
was
lady
wilde
who
urged
him
to
take
rooms
near
her
she
never
doubted
his
ultimate
triumph
she
knew
all
his
poems
by
heart
took
the
strass
for
diamonds
and
welcomed
the
chance
of
introducing
her
brilliant
son
to
the
irish
nationalist
members
and
other
pinchbeck
celebrities
who
flocked
about
her
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
first
saw
lady
wilde
i
was
introduced
to
her
by
willie
oscar
elder
brother
whom
i
had
met
in
fleet
street
willie
was
then
a
tall
fellow
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
with
an
expressive
taking
face
lit
up
with
a
pair
of
deep
blue
laughing
eyes
he
had
any
amount
of
physical
vivacity
and
told
a
good
story
with
immense
verve
without
for
a
moment
getting
above
the
commonplace
to
him
the
corinthian
journalism
of
the
daily
telegraph
was
literature
still
he
had
the
surface
good
nature
and
good
humour
of
healthy
youth
and
was
generally
liked
he
took
me
to
his
house
one
afternoon
but
first
he
had
a
drink
here
and
a
chat
there
so
that
we
did
not
reach
the
west
end
till
after
six
the
room
and
its
occupants
made
an
indelible
grotesque
impression
on
me
it
seemed
smaller
than
it
was
because
overcrowded
with
a
score
of
women
and
half
a
dozen
men
it
was
very
dark
and
there
were
empty
and
cigarette
ends
everywhere
lady
wilde
sat
enthroned
behind
the
looking
like
a
sort
of
female
buddha
swathed
in
wraps
a
large
woman
with
a
heavy
face
and
prominent
nose
very
like
oscar
indeed
with
the
same
sallow
skin
which
always
looked
dirty
her
eyes
too
were
her
redeeming
feature
vivacious
and
as
a
girl
she
made
up
like
an
actress
and
naturally
preferred
shadowed
gloom
to
sunlight
her
idealism
came
to
show
as
soon
as
she
spoke
it
was
a
necessity
of
her
nature
to
be
enthusiastic
unfriendly
critics
said
hysterical
but
i
should
prefer
to
say
about
everything
she
enjoyed
or
admired
she
was
at
her
best
in
misfortune
her
great
vanity
gave
her
a
certain
proud
stoicism
which
was
admirable
the
land
league
was
under
discussion
as
we
entered
and
parnell
attitude
to
it
lady
wilde
regarded
him
as
the
predestined
saviour
of
her
country
parnell
she
said
with
a
strong
accent
on
the
first
syllable
is
the
man
of
destiny
he
will
strike
off
the
fetters
and
free
ireland
and
throne
her
as
queen
among
the
nations
a
murmur
of
applause
came
from
a
thin
birdlike
woman
standing
opposite
who
floated
towards
us
clad
in
a
gown
which
sheathed
her
like
an
umbrella
case
had
she
had
any
figure
the
dress
would
have
been
indecent
how
like
she
cooed
dear
lady
wilde
i
noticed
that
her
glance
went
towards
willie
who
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
his
mother
talking
to
a
tall
handsome
girl
willie
friend
seemed
amused
at
the
lyrical
outburst
of
the
green
spinster
for
smiling
a
little
she
questioned
him
is
lady
wilde
she
asked
with
a
slight
american
accent
lady
wilde
informed
the
company
with
all
the
impressiveness
she
had
at
command
that
she
did
not
expect
oscar
that
afternoon
he
is
so
busy
with
his
new
poems
you
know
they
say
there
has
been
no
such
sensation
since
byron
she
added
already
everyone
is
talking
of
them
indeed
yes
sighed
the
green
lily
do
you
remember
dear
speranza
what
he
said
about
sphinx
that
he
read
to
us
he
told
us
the
written
verse
was
quite
different
from
what
the
printed
poem
would
be
just
as
the
sculptor
clay
model
differs
from
the
marble
subtle
was
it
perfectly
true
too
cried
a
man
with
a
falsetto
voice
moving
into
the
circle
leonardo
himself
might
have
said
that
the
whole
scene
seemed
to
me
affected
and
untidy
too
with
an
english
note
about
it
of
shiftlessness
the
aesthetic
dresses
were
extravagant
the
enthusiasms
pumped
up
and
exaggerated
i
was
glad
to
leave
quietly
it
was
on
this
visit
to
lady
wilde
or
a
later
one
that
i
first
heard
of
that
other
poem
of
oscar
the
harlot
house
which
was
also
said
to
have
been
written
in
paris
though
published
in
an
obscure
sheet
and
in
itself
commonplace
enough
it
made
an
astonishing
stir
time
and
advertisement
had
been
working
for
him
academic
lectures
and
imitative
poetry
alike
had
made
him
widely
known
and
thanks
to
the
small
body
of
enthusiastic
admirers
whom
i
have
already
spoken
of
his
reputation
instead
of
waning
out
had
grown
like
the
jinn
when
released
from
the
bottle
the
fuglemen
were
determined
to
find
something
wonderful
in
everything
he
did
and
the
title
of
the
harlot
house
shocking
philistinism
gave
them
a
certain
opportunity
which
they
used
to
the
uttermost
on
all
sides
one
was
asked
have
you
seen
oscar
latest
and
then
the
last
verse
would
be
quoted
divine
do
ye
think
and
down
the
long
and
silent
street
the
dawn
with
feet
crept
like
a
frightened
girl
in
spite
of
all
this
extravagant
eulogy
oscar
wilde
early
plays
and
poems
like
his
lectures
were
unimportant
the
small
remnant
of
people
in
england
who
really
love
the
things
of
the
spirit
were
disappointed
in
them
failed
to
find
in
them
the
genius
so
loudly
and
so
arrogantly
vaunted
but
if
oscar
wilde
early
writings
were
failures
his
talk
was
more
successful
than
ever
he
still
tried
to
show
off
on
all
occasions
and
sometimes
fell
flat
in
consequence
but
his
failures
in
this
field
were
few
and
merely
comparative
constant
practice
was
ripening
his
extraordinary
natural
gift
about
this
time
too
he
began
to
develop
that
humorous
vein
in
conversation
which
later
lent
a
singular
distinction
to
his
casual
utterances
his
talk
brought
him
numerous
invitations
to
dinner
and
lunch
and
introduced
him
to
some
of
the
best
houses
in
london
but
it
produced
no
money
he
was
earning
very
little
and
he
needed
money
comparatively
large
sums
of
money
from
week
to
week
oscar
wilde
was
extravagant
in
almost
every
possible
way
he
wished
to
be
fed
and
prodigal
of
tips
he
wanted
first
editions
of
the
poets
had
a
liking
for
old
furniture
and
old
silver
for
fine
pictures
eastern
carpets
and
renascence
bronzes
in
fine
he
had
all
the
artist
desires
as
well
as
those
of
the
poet
and
viveur
he
was
constantly
in
dire
need
of
cash
and
did
not
hesitate
to
borrow
fifty
pounds
from
anyone
who
would
lend
it
to
him
he
was
beginning
to
experience
the
truth
of
the
old
verse
a
very
good
world
to
live
in
to
lend
or
to
spend
or
to
give
in
but
to
beg
or
to
borrow
or
get
a
man
own
is
the
very
worst
world
that
ever
was
known
the
difficulties
of
life
were
constantly
increasing
upon
him
he
despised
bread
and
butter
and
talked
only
of
champagne
and
caviare
but
without
bread
hunger
is
imminent
victory
no
longer
seemed
indubitable
it
was
possible
it
began
even
to
be
probable
that
the
fair
ship
of
his
fame
might
come
to
wreck
on
the
shoals
of
poverty
it
was
painfully
clear
that
he
must
do
something
without
further
delay
must
either
conquer
want
or
overleap
it
would
he
bridle
his
desires
live
savingly
and
write
assiduously
till
such
repute
came
as
would
enable
him
to
launch
out
and
indulge
his
tastes
he
was
wise
enough
to
see
the
advantages
of
such
a
course
every
day
his
reputation
as
a
talker
was
growing
had
he
had
a
little
more
had
he
waited
a
little
longer
till
his
position
in
society
was
secured
he
could
easily
have
married
someone
with
money
and
position
who
would
have
placed
him
above
sordid
care
and
fear
for
ever
but
he
could
not
wait
he
was
colossally
vain
he
would
wear
the
peacock
feathers
at
all
times
and
all
costs
he
was
intensely
too
his
mouth
watered
for
every
fruit
besides
he
could
write
with
creditors
at
the
door
like
bossuet
he
was
unable
to
work
when
bothered
about
small
economies
etait
a
dans
son
domestique
what
was
to
be
done
suddenly
he
cut
the
knot
and
married
the
daughter
of
a
a
miss
constance
lloyd
a
young
lady
without
any
particular
qualities
or
beauty
whom
he
had
met
in
dublin
on
a
lecture
tour
miss
lloyd
had
a
few
hundreds
a
year
of
her
own
just
enough
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
the
couple
went
to
live
in
tite
street
chelsea
in
a
modest
little
house
the
however
was
decorated
by
godwin
and
quickly
gained
a
certain
notoriety
it
was
indeed
a
charming
room
with
an
artistic
distinction
and
appeal
of
its
own
as
soon
as
the
dreadful
load
of
poverty
was
removed
oscar
began
to
go
about
a
great
deal
and
his
wife
would
certainly
have
been
invited
with
him
if
he
had
refused
invitations
addressed
to
himself
alone
but
from
the
beginning
he
accepted
them
and
consequently
after
the
first
few
months
of
marriage
his
wife
went
out
but
little
and
later
children
came
and
kept
her
at
home
having
earned
a
respite
from
care
by
his
marriage
oscar
did
little
for
the
next
three
years
but
talk
critical
observers
began
to
make
up
their
minds
that
he
was
a
talker
and
not
a
writer
he
was
a
power
in
the
art
as
de
quincey
said
of
coleridge
and
he
carried
a
new
art
into
the
power
every
year
this
gift
grew
with
him
every
year
he
talked
more
and
more
brilliantly
and
he
was
allowed
now
and
indeed
expected
to
hold
the
table
in
london
there
is
no
such
thing
as
conversation
now
and
then
one
hears
a
caustic
or
witty
phrase
but
nothing
more
the
tone
of
good
society
everywhere
is
to
be
pleasant
without
being
prominent
in
every
other
european
country
however
able
men
are
encouraged
to
talk
in
england
alone
they
are
discouraged
people
in
society
use
a
debased
jargon
or
slang
snobbish
shibboleths
for
the
most
part
and
the
majority
resent
any
one
man
monopolising
attention
but
oscar
wilde
was
allowed
this
privileged
position
was
encouraged
to
hold
forth
to
amuse
people
as
singers
are
brought
in
to
sing
after
dinner
though
his
fame
as
a
witty
and
delightful
talker
grew
from
week
to
week
even
his
marriage
did
not
stifle
the
undertone
of
dislike
and
disgust
now
indignantly
now
with
contempt
men
spoke
of
him
as
abandoned
a
creature
of
unnatural
viciousness
there
were
certain
houses
in
the
best
set
of
london
society
the
doors
of
which
were
closed
to
him
chapter
vi
oscar
wilde
faith
and
practice
from
on
i
met
oscar
wilde
continually
now
at
the
theatre
now
in
some
society
drawing
room
most
often
i
think
at
jeune
afterwards
lady
helier
his
appearance
was
not
in
his
favour
there
was
something
oily
and
fat
about
him
that
repelled
me
naturally
being
and
young
i
tried
to
give
my
repugnance
a
moral
foundation
fleshly
indulgence
and
laziness
i
said
to
myself
were
written
all
over
him
the
snatches
of
his
monologues
which
i
caught
from
time
to
time
seemed
to
me
to
consist
chiefly
of
epigrams
almost
mechanically
constructed
of
proverbs
and
familiar
sayings
turned
upside
down
two
of
balzac
characters
it
will
be
remembered
practised
this
form
of
humour
the
desire
to
astonish
and
dazzle
the
love
of
the
uncommon
for
its
own
sake
was
so
evident
that
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
avoided
him
one
evening
however
at
jeune
i
got
to
know
him
better
at
the
very
door
jeune
came
up
to
me
have
you
ever
met
oscar
wilde
you
ought
to
know
him
he
is
so
delightfully
clever
so
brilliant
i
went
with
her
and
was
formally
introduced
to
him
he
shook
hands
in
a
limp
way
i
disliked
his
hands
were
flabby
greasy
his
skin
looked
bilious
and
dirty
he
wore
a
great
green
scarab
ring
on
one
finger
he
was
rather
than
his
clothes
fitted
him
too
tightly
he
was
too
stout
he
had
a
trick
which
i
noticed
even
then
which
grew
on
him
later
of
pulling
his
jowl
with
his
right
hand
as
he
spoke
and
his
jowl
was
already
fat
and
pouchy
his
appearance
filled
me
with
distaste
i
lay
stress
on
this
physical
repulsion
because
i
think
most
people
felt
it
and
in
itself
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
fascination
of
the
man
that
he
should
have
overcome
the
first
impression
so
completely
and
so
quickly
i
do
remember
what
we
talked
about
but
i
noticed
almost
immediately
that
his
grey
eyes
were
finely
expressive
in
turn
vivacious
laughing
sympathetic
always
beautiful
the
carven
mouth
too
with
its
heavy
chiselled
lips
had
a
certain
attraction
and
significance
in
spite
of
a
black
front
tooth
which
shocked
one
when
he
laughed
he
was
over
six
feet
in
height
and
both
broad
and
he
looked
like
a
roman
emperor
of
the
decadence
we
had
a
certain
interest
in
each
other
an
interest
of
curiosity
for
i
remember
that
he
led
the
way
almost
at
once
into
the
inner
drawing
room
in
order
to
be
free
to
talk
in
some
seclusion
after
half
an
hour
or
so
i
asked
him
to
lunch
next
day
at
the
cafe
royal
then
the
best
restaurant
in
london
at
this
time
he
was
a
superb
talker
more
brilliant
than
any
i
have
ever
heard
in
england
but
nothing
like
what
he
became
later
his
talk
soon
made
me
forget
his
repellant
physical
peculiarities
indeed
i
soon
lost
sight
of
them
so
completely
that
i
have
wondered
since
how
i
could
have
been
so
disagreeably
affected
by
them
at
first
sight
there
was
an
extraordinary
physical
vivacity
and
geniality
in
the
man
an
extraordinary
charm
in
his
gaiety
and
quick
intelligence
his
enthusiasms
too
were
infectious
every
mental
question
interested
him
especially
if
it
had
anything
to
do
with
art
or
literature
his
whole
face
lit
up
as
he
spoke
and
one
saw
nothing
but
his
soulful
eyes
heard
nothing
but
his
musical
tenor
voice
he
was
indeed
what
the
french
call
a
charmeur
in
ten
minutes
i
confessed
to
myself
that
i
liked
him
and
his
talk
was
intensely
quickening
he
had
something
unexpected
to
say
on
almost
every
subject
his
mind
was
agile
and
powerful
and
he
took
a
delight
in
using
it
he
was
too
in
several
languages
especially
in
french
and
his
excellent
memory
stood
him
in
good
stead
even
when
he
merely
reproduced
what
the
great
writers
had
said
perfectly
he
added
a
new
colouring
and
already
his
characteristic
humour
was
beginning
to
illumine
every
topic
with
lambent
flashes
it
was
at
our
first
lunch
i
think
that
he
told
me
he
had
been
asked
by
harper
to
write
a
book
of
one
hundred
thousand
words
and
offered
a
large
sum
for
it
i
think
some
five
thousand
dollars
in
advance
he
wrote
to
them
gravely
that
there
were
not
one
hundred
thousand
words
in
english
so
he
could
not
undertake
the
work
and
laughed
merrily
like
a
child
at
the
cheeky
reproof
i
have
sent
their
letters
and
my
reply
to
the
press
he
added
and
laughed
again
while
probing
me
with
inquisitive
eyes
how
far
did
i
understand
the
need
of
about
this
time
an
impromptu
of
his
moved
the
town
to
laughter
at
some
dinner
party
it
appeared
the
ladies
sat
a
little
too
long
oscar
wanted
to
smoke
suddenly
the
hostess
drew
his
attention
to
a
lamp
the
shade
of
which
was
smouldering
please
put
it
out
wilde
she
said
it
smoking
oscar
turned
to
do
as
he
was
told
with
the
remark
happy
lamp
the
delightful
impertinence
had
an
extraordinary
success
early
in
our
friendship
i
was
fain
to
see
that
the
love
of
the
uncommon
his
paradoxes
and
epigrams
were
natural
to
him
sprang
immediately
from
his
taste
and
temperament
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
define
once
for
all
his
attitude
towards
life
with
more
scope
and
particularity
than
i
have
hitherto
done
it
is
often
assumed
that
he
had
no
clear
and
coherent
view
of
life
no
belief
no
faith
to
guide
his
vagrant
footsteps
but
such
an
opinion
does
him
injustice
he
had
his
own
philosophy
and
held
to
it
for
long
years
with
astonishing
tenacity
his
attitude
towards
life
can
best
be
seen
if
he
is
held
up
against
goethe
he
took
the
artist
view
of
life
which
goethe
was
the
first
to
state
and
indeed
in
youth
had
overstated
with
an
astonishing
persuasiveness
the
beautiful
is
more
than
the
good
said
goethe
for
it
includes
the
good
it
seemed
to
oscar
as
it
had
seemed
to
young
goethe
that
the
extraordinary
alone
survives
the
extraordinary
whether
good
or
bad
he
therefore
sought
after
the
extraordinary
and
naturally
enough
often
fell
into
the
extravagant
but
how
stimulating
it
was
in
london
where
sordid
platitudes
drip
and
drizzle
all
day
long
to
hear
someone
talking
brilliant
paradoxes
goethe
did
not
linger
long
in
the
halfway
house
of
unbelief
the
murderer
may
win
notoriety
as
easily
as
the
martyr
but
his
memory
will
not
remain
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
away
said
goethe
i
would
fain
occupy
myself
with
that
which
endures
midway
in
life
goethe
accepted
kant
moral
imperative
and
restated
his
creed
a
man
must
resolve
to
live
he
said
for
the
good
and
beautiful
and
for
the
common
weal
oscar
did
not
push
his
thought
so
far
the
transcendental
was
not
his
field
it
was
a
pity
i
sometimes
felt
that
he
had
not
studied
german
as
thoroughly
as
french
goethe
might
have
done
more
for
him
than
baudelaire
or
balzac
for
in
spite
of
all
his
stodgy
german
faults
goethe
is
the
best
guide
through
the
mysteries
of
life
whom
the
modern
world
has
yet
produced
oscar
wilde
stopped
where
the
religion
of
goethe
began
he
was
far
more
of
a
pagan
and
individualist
than
the
great
german
he
lived
for
the
beautiful
and
extraordinary
but
not
for
the
good
and
still
less
for
the
whole
he
acknowledged
no
moral
obligation
in
commune
bonis
was
an
ideal
which
never
said
anything
to
him
he
cared
nothing
for
the
common
weal
he
held
himself
above
the
mass
of
the
people
with
an
englishman
extravagant
insularity
and
aggressive
pride
politics
social
problems
religion
everything
interested
him
simply
as
a
subject
of
art
life
itself
was
merely
material
for
art
he
held
the
position
goethe
had
abandoned
in
youth
the
view
was
astounding
in
england
and
new
everywhere
in
its
onesidedness
its
passionate
exaggeration
however
was
quickening
and
there
is
of
course
something
to
be
said
for
it
the
artistic
view
of
life
is
often
higher
than
the
ordinary
religious
view
at
least
it
does
not
deal
in
condemnations
and
exclusions
it
is
more
reasonable
more
catholic
more
finely
perceptive
the
artist
view
of
life
is
the
only
possible
one
oscar
used
to
say
and
should
be
applied
to
everything
most
of
all
to
religion
and
morality
cavaliers
and
puritans
are
interesting
for
their
costumes
and
not
for
their
convictions
there
is
no
general
rule
of
health
it
is
all
personal
individual
i
only
demand
that
freedom
which
i
willingly
concede
to
others
no
one
condemns
another
for
preferring
green
to
gold
why
should
any
taste
be
ostracized
liking
and
disliking
are
not
under
our
control
i
want
to
choose
the
nourishment
which
suits
my
body
and
my
soul
i
can
almost
hear
him
say
the
words
with
his
charming
humorous
smile
and
exquisite
flash
of
deprecation
as
if
he
were
half
inclined
to
make
fun
of
his
own
statement
it
was
not
his
views
on
art
however
which
recommended
him
to
the
aristocratic
set
in
london
but
his
contempt
for
social
reform
or
rather
his
utter
indifference
to
it
and
his
english
love
of
inequality
the
republicanism
he
flaunted
in
his
early
verses
was
not
even
skin
deep
his
political
beliefs
and
prejudices
were
the
prejudices
of
the
english
governing
class
and
were
all
in
favour
of
individual
freedom
or
anarchy
under
the
protection
of
the
policeman
the
poor
are
poor
creatures
was
his
real
belief
and
must
always
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
they
are
merely
the
virgin
soil
out
of
which
men
of
genius
and
artists
grow
like
flowers
their
function
is
to
give
birth
to
genius
and
nourish
it
they
have
no
other
raison
were
men
as
intelligent
as
bees
all
gifted
individuals
would
be
supported
by
the
community
as
the
bees
support
their
queen
we
should
be
the
first
charge
on
the
state
just
as
socrates
declared
that
he
should
be
kept
in
the
prytaneum
at
the
public
expense
do
talk
to
me
frank
about
the
hardships
of
the
poor
the
hardships
of
the
poor
are
necessities
but
talk
to
me
of
the
hardships
of
men
of
genius
and
i
could
weep
tears
of
blood
i
was
never
so
affected
by
any
book
in
my
life
as
i
was
by
the
misery
of
balzac
poet
lucien
de
rubempre
naturally
this
creed
of
an
exaggerated
individualism
appealed
peculiarly
to
the
best
set
in
london
it
was
eminently
aristocratic
and
might
almost
be
defended
as
scientific
for
to
a
certain
extent
it
found
corroboration
in
darwinism
all
progress
according
to
darwin
comes
from
peculiar
individuals
sports
as
men
of
science
call
them
or
the
as
rhetoricians
prefer
to
style
them
the
many
are
only
there
to
produce
more
sports
and
ultimately
to
benefit
by
them
all
this
is
valid
enough
but
it
leaves
the
crux
of
the
question
untouched
the
poor
in
aristocratic
england
are
too
degraded
to
produce
sports
of
genius
or
indeed
any
sports
of
much
value
to
humanity
such
an
extravagant
inequality
of
condition
obtains
there
that
the
noble
soul
is
miserable
the
strongest
insecure
but
wilde
creed
was
intensely
popular
with
the
smart
set
because
of
its
very
and
he
was
hailed
as
a
prophet
partly
because
he
defended
the
cherished
prejudices
of
the
landed
oligarchy
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
oscar
wilde
was
in
some
danger
of
suffering
from
excessive
popularity
and
unmerited
renown
indeed
if
he
had
loved
athletic
sports
hunting
and
shooting
instead
of
art
and
letters
he
might
have
been
the
selected
representative
of
aristocratic
england
in
addition
to
his
own
popular
qualities
a
strong
current
was
sweeping
him
to
success
he
was
detested
by
the
whole
of
the
middle
or
class
which
in
england
according
to
matthew
arnold
has
the
sense
of
conduct
and
has
but
little
else
this
class
hated
and
feared
him
feared
him
for
his
intellectual
freedom
and
his
contempt
of
conventionality
and
hated
him
because
of
his
hearted
and
also
because
it
saw
in
him
none
of
its
own
sordid
virtues
punch
is
peculiarly
the
representative
of
this
class
and
of
all
english
prejudices
and
punch
jeered
at
him

in
prose
now
in
verse

the
italics
are
mine

the
suggestion
was
always
implicit
yet
this
constant
wind
of
puritanic
hatred
blowing
against
him
helped

believe
me
child
all
the
gentleman
misfortunes
arose
from
his
being
educated
at
a
public
school
fielding
in
england
success
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
the
tone
of
good
society
though
responsive
to
political
talent
and
openly
eagerly
sensitive
to
talent
is
contemptuous
of
genius
and
rates
the
utmost
brilliancy
of
the
talker
hardly
higher
than
the
feats
of
an
acrobat
men
are
obstinate
slow
trusting
a
rather
than
brains
and
giving
way
reluctantly
to
superiority
the
road
up
to
power
or
influence
in
england
is
full
of
pitfalls
and
far
too
arduous
for
those
who
have
neither
high
birth
nor
wealth
to
help
them
the
natural
inequality
of
men
instead
of
being
mitigated
by
law
or
custom
is
everywhere
strengthened
and
increased
by
a
thousand
effete
social
distinctions
even
in
the
best
class
where
a
certain
easy
familiarity
reigns
there
is
circle
above
circle
and
the
summits
are
isolated
by
heredity
the
conditions
of
english
society
being
what
they
are
it
is
all
but
impossible
at
first
to
account
for
the
rapidity
of
oscar
wilde
social
success
yet
if
we
tell
over
his
advantages
and
bring
one
or
two
into
the
account
which
have
not
yet
been
reckoned
we
shall
find
almost
every
element
that
conduces
to
popularity
by
talent
and
conviction
he
was
the
natural
pet
of
the
aristocracy
whose
selfish
prejudices
he
defended
and
whose
leisure
he
amused
the
middle
class
as
has
been
noted
disliked
and
despised
him
but
its
social
influence
is
small
and
its
papers
and
especially
punch
made
him
notorious
by
attacking
him
in
and
out
of
season
the
comic
weekly
indeed
helped
to
build
up
his
reputation
by
the
almost
inexplicable
bitterness
of
its
invective
another
potent
force
was
in
his
favour
from
the
beginning
he
set
himself
to
play
the
game
of
the
popular
actor
and
neglected
no
opportunity
of
turning
the
limelight
on
his
own
doings
as
he
said
his
admiration
of
himself
was
a
lifelong
devotion
and
he
proclaimed
his
passion
on
the
housetops
our
names
happened
to
be
mentioned
together
once
in
some
paper
i
think
it
was
the
pall
mall
gazette
he
asked
me
what
i
was
going
to
reply
nothing
i
answered
why
should
i
bother
i
done
nothing
yet
that
deserves
trumpeting
you
making
a
mistake
he
said
seriously
if
you
wish
for
reputation
and
fame
in
this
world
and
success
during
your
lifetime
you
ought
to
seize
every
opportunity
of
advertising
yourself
you
remember
the
latin
word
springs
from
one
own
house
like
other
wise
sayings
it
not
quite
true
fame
comes
from
oneself
and
he
laughed
delightedly
you
must
go
about
repeating
how
great
you
are
till
the
dull
crowd
comes
to
believe
it
the
prophet
must
proclaim
himself
eh
and
declare
his
own
mission
that
it
he
replied
with
a
smile
that
it
every
time
my
name
is
mentioned
in
a
paper
i
write
at
once
to
admit
that
i
am
the
messiah
why
is
pears
soap
successful
not
because
it
is
better
or
cheaper
than
any
other
soap
but
because
it
is
more
strenuously
puffed
the
journalist
is
my
the
baptist
what
would
you
give
when
a
book
of
yours
comes
out
to
be
able
to
write
a
long
article
drawing
attention
to
it
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
here
you
have
the
opportunity
of
making
your
name
known
just
as
widely
why
not
avail
yourself
of
it
i
miss
no
chance
and
to
do
him
justice
he
used
occasion
to
the
utmost
curiously
enough
bacon
had
the
same
insight
and
i
have
often
wondered
since
whether
oscar
worldly
wisdom
was
original
or
was
borrowed
from
the
great
elizabethan
climber
bacon
says
sound
your
own
praises
and
some
of
them
will
stick
it
will
stick
with
the
more
ignorant
and
the
populace
though
men
of
wisdom
may
smile
at
it
and
the
reputation
won
with
many
will
amply
countervail
the
disdain
of
a
few
and
surely
no
small
number
of
those
who
are
of
solid
nature
and
who
from
the
want
of
this
ventosity
can
not
spread
all
sail
in
pursuit
of
their
own
honour
suffer
some
prejudice
and
lose
dignity
by
their
moderation
many
of
oscar
letters
to
the
papers
in
these
years
were
amusing
some
of
them
full
of
humour
for
example
when
he
was
asked
to
give
a
list
of
the
hundred
best
books
as
lord
avebury
and
other
mediocrities
had
done
he
wrote
saying
that
he
could
not
give
a
list
of
the
hundred
best
books
as
he
had
only
written
five
winged
words
of
his
were
always
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
town
some
theatre
was
opened
which
was
found
horribly
ugly
one
spoke
of
it
as
early
victorian
no
no
replied
oscar
nothing
so
distinctive
maple
rather
even
his
impertinences
made
echoes
at
a
great
reception
a
friend
asked
him
in
passing
how
the
hostess
lady
s
could
be
recognized
lady
s
being
short
and
stout
oscar
replied
smiling
go
through
this
room
my
dear
fellow
and
the
next
and
so
on
till
you
come
to
someone
looking
like
a
public
monument
say
the
effigy
of
britannia
or
victoria
that
lady
s
though
he
used
to
pretend
that
all
this
was
premeditated
and
planned
i
could
hardly
believe
him
he
was
eager
to
write
about
himself
because
of
his
exaggerated
vanity
and
reflection
afterwards
found
grounds
to
justify
his
inclination
but
whatever
the
motive
may
have
been
the
effect
was
palpable
his
name
was
continually
in
men
mouths
and
his
fame
grew
by
repetition
as
tiberius
said
of
mucianus
omnium
quae
dixerat
feceratque
arte
quadam
ostentator
he
had
a
knack
of
showing
off
and
advertising
whatever
he
said
or
did
but
no
personal
qualities
however
eminent
no
gifts
no
graces
of
heart
or
head
or
soul
could
have
brought
a
young
man
to
oscar
wilde
social
position
and
popularity
in
a
few
years
another
cause
was
at
work
lifting
him
steadily
from
the
time
he
left
oxford
he
was
acclaimed
and
backed
by
a
small
minority
of
passionate
admirers
whom
i
have
called
his
fuglemen
these
admirers
formed
the
constant
factor
in
his
progress
from
social
height
to
height
for
the
most
part
they
were
persons
usually
called
sexual
inverts
who
looked
to
the
brilliancy
of
his
intellect
to
gild
their
esoteric
indulgence
this
class
in
england
is
almost
wholly
recruited
from
the
aristocracy
and
the
upper
that
apes
the
smart
set
it
is
an
inevitable
product
of
the
english
boarding
school
and
university
system
indeed
one
of
the
most
characteristic
products
i
shall
probably
bring
upon
myself
a
host
of
enemies
by
this
assertion
but
it
has
been
weighed
and
must
stand
fielding
has
already
put
the
same
view
on
record
he
says
a
public
school
joseph
was
the
cause
of
all
the
calamities
which
he
afterwards
suffered
public
schools
are
the
nurseries
of
all
vice
and
immorality
all
the
wicked
fellows
whom
i
remember
at
the
university
were
bred
at
them
if
life
with
its
close
intimacies
between
boys
from
twelve
to
eighteen
years
of
age
were
understood
by
english
mothers
it
is
safe
to
say
that
every
in
every
school
would
disappear
in
a
single
night
and
eton
harrow
winchester
and
the
rest
would
be
turned
into
those
who
have
learned
bad
habits
at
school
or
in
the
are
inclined
to
continue
the
practices
in
later
life
naturally
enough
these
men
are
usually
distinguished
by
a
certain
artistic
sympathy
and
often
by
most
attractive
intellectual
qualities
as
a
rule
the
epicene
have
soft
voices
and
ingratiating
manners
and
are
bold
enough
to
make
a
direct
appeal
to
the
heart
and
emotions
they
are
considered
the
very
cream
of
london
society
these
admirers
and
supporters
praised
and
defended
oscar
wilde
from
the
beginning
with
the
persistence
and
courage
of
men
who
if
they
do
hang
together
are
likely
to
hang
separately
after
his
trial
and
condemnation
the
daily
telegraph
spoke
with
contempt
of
these
decadents
and
aesthetes
who
it
asserted
could
be
numbered
in
london
society
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
but
even
the
daily
telegraph
must
have
known
that
in
the
smart
set
alone
there
are
hundreds
of
these
acolytes
whose
intellectual
and
artistic
culture
gives
them
an
importance
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
number
it
was
the
passionate
support
of
these
men
in
the
first
place
which
made
oscar
wilde
notorious
and
successful
this
fact
may
well
give
pause
to
the
thoughtful
reader
in
the
middle
ages
when
birth
and
position
had
a
disproportionate
power
in
life
the
catholic
church
supplied
a
certain
democratic
corrective
to
the
inequality
of
social
conditions
it
was
a
sort
of
jacob
ladder
leading
from
the
lowest
strata
of
society
to
the
very
heavens
and
offering
to
ingenuous
youthful
talent
a
career
of
infinite
hope
and
unlimited
ambition
this
great
power
of
the
roman
church
in
the
may
well
be
compared
to
the
influence
exerted
by
those
whom
i
have
designated
as
oscar
wilde
fuglemen
in
the
england
of
today
the
easiest
way
to
success
in
london
society
is
to
be
notorious
in
this
sense
whatever
career
one
may
have
chosen
however
humble
one
birth
one
is
then
certain
of
finding
distinguished
friends
and
impassioned
advocates
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
army
and
unmarried
you
are
declared
to
be
a
strategist
like
caesar
or
an
organizer
like
moltke
if
you
are
an
artist
instead
of
having
your
faults
proclaimed
and
your
failings
scourged
your
qualifications
are
eulogised
and
you
find
yourself
compared
to
michel
angelo
or
titian
i
would
not
willingly
exaggerate
here
but
i
could
easily
give
dozens
of
instances
to
prove
that
sexual
perversion
is
a
jacob
ladder
to
most
forms
of
success
in
our
time
in
london
it
seems
a
curious
effect
of
the
great
compensatory
balance
of
things
that
a
masculine
rude
people
like
the
english
who
love
nothing
so
much
as
adventures
and
warlike
achievements
should
allow
themselves
to
be
steered
in
ordinary
times
by
epicene
aesthetes
but
no
one
who
knows
the
facts
will
deny
that
these
men
are
prodigiously
influential
in
london
in
all
artistic
and
literary
matters
and
it
was
their
constant
passionate
support
which
lifted
oscar
wilde
so
quickly
to
eminence
from
the
beginning
they
fought
for
him
he
was
regarded
as
a
leader
among
them
when
still
at
oxford
yet
his
early
writings
show
no
trace
of
such
a
prepossession
they
are
wholly
void
of
offence
without
even
a
suggestion
of
coarseness
as
pure
indeed
as
his
talk
nevertheless
as
soon
as
his
name
came
up
among
men
in
town
the
accusation
of
abnormal
viciousness
was
either
made
or
hinted
everyone
spoke
as
if
there
were
no
doubt
about
his
tastes
and
this
in
spite
of
the
habitual
reticence
of
englishmen
i
could
not
understand
how
the
imputation
came
to
be
so
bold
and
universal
how
so
shameful
a
calumny
as
i
regarded
it
was
so
firmly
established
in
men
minds
again
and
again
i
protested
against
the
injustice
demanded
proofs
but
was
met
only
by
shrugs
and
pitying
glances
as
if
my
prejudice
must
indeed
be
invincible
if
i
needed
evidence
of
the
obvious
i
have
since
been
assured
on
what
should
be
excellent
authority
that
the
evil
reputation
which
attached
to
oscar
wilde
in
those
early
years
in
london
was
completely
undeserved
i
too
must
say
that
in
the
first
period
of
our
friendship
i
never
noticed
anything
that
could
give
colour
even
to
suspicion
of
him
but
the
belief
in
his
abnormal
tastes
was
widespread
and
dated
from
his
life
in
oxford
from
about
on
however
there
was
a
notable
change
in
oscar
manners
and
mode
of
life
he
had
been
married
a
couple
of
years
two
children
had
been
born
to
him
yet
instead
of
settling
down
he
appeared
suddenly
to
have
become
wilder
in
he
accepted
the
editorship
of
a
lady
paper
the
woman
world
and
was
always
mocking
at
the
selection
of
himself
as
the
fittest
for
such
a
post
he
had
grown
noticeably
bolder
i
told
myself
that
an
assured
income
and
position
give
confidence
but
at
bottom
a
doubt
began
to
form
in
me
it
ca
be
denied
that
from
on
incidents
occurred
from
time
to
time
which
kept
the
suspicion
of
him
alive
and
indeed
pointed
and
strengthened
it
i
shall
have
to
deal
now
with
some
of
the
more
important
of
these
occurrences
chapter

growth
to
originality
about
the
period
of
growth
of
any
organism
is
the
most
interesting
and
most
instructive
and
there
is
no
moment
of
growth
in
the
individual
life
which
can
be
compared
in
importance
with
the
moment
when
a
man
begins
to
outtop
his
age
and
to
suggest
the
future
evolution
of
humanity
by
his
own
genius
usually
this
final
stage
is
passed
in

anxieties
allowed
him
to

touch
of
the
spur
from

good
but
a
constant
rowelling
disables
as
editor
of
the
woman
world
oscar
had
some
money
of
his
own
to
spend
though
his
salary
was
only
some
six
pounds
a
week
it
made
him
independent
and
his
editorial
work
gave
him
an
excuse
for
not
exhausting
himself
by
writing
for
some
years
after
marriage
in
fact
till
he
lost
his
editorship
he
wrote
little
and
talked
a
great
deal
during
this
period
we
were
often
together
he
lunched
with
me
once
or
twice
a
week
and
i
began
to
know
his
method
of
work
everything
came
to
him
in
the
excitement
of
talk
epigrams
paradoxes
and
stories
and
when
people
of
great
position
or
title
were
about
him
he
generally
managed
to
surpass
himself
all
social
distinctions
appealed
to
him
intensely
i
chaffed
him
about
this
one
day
and
he
admitted
the
snobbishness
gaily
i
love
even
historic
names
frank
as
shakespeare
did
surely
everyone
prefers
norfolk
hamilton
and
buckingham
to
jones
or
smith
or
robinson
as
soon
as
he
lost
his
editorship
he
took
to
writing
for
the
reviews
his
articles
were
merely
the
resume
of
his
monologues
after
talking
for
months
at
this
and
that
lunch
and
dinner
he
had
amassed
a
store
of
epigrams
and
humorous
paradoxes
which
he
could
embody
in
a
paper
for
the
fortnightly
review
or
the
nineteenth
century
these
papers
made
it
manifest
that
wilde
had
at
length
as
heine
phrased
it
reached
the
topmost
height
of
the
culture
of
his
time
and
was
now
able
to
say
new
and
interesting
things
his
lehrjahre
or
may
be
said
to
have
ended
with
his
editorship
the
articles
which
he
wrote
on
the
decay
of
lying
the
critic
as
artist
and
pen
pencil
and
poison
in
fact
all
the
papers
which
in
were
gathered
together
and
published
in
book
form
under
the
title
of
intentions
had
about
them
the
stamp
of
originality
they
achieved
a
noteworthy
success
with
the
best
minds
and
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fame
every
paper
contained
here
and
there
a
happy
phrase
or
epigram
or
flirt
of
humour
which
made
it
memorable
to
the
lover
of
letters
they
were
all
however
conceived
and
written
from
the
standpoint
of
the
artist
and
the
artist
alone
who
never
takes
account
of
ethics
but
uses
right
and
wrong
indifferently
as
colours
of
his
palette
the
decay
of
lying
seemed
to
the
ordinary
englishman
a
cynical
plea
in
defence
of
mendacity
to
the
majority
of
readers
pen
pencil
and
poison
was
hardly
more
than
a
shameful
attempt
to
condone
murder
the
very
articles
which
grounded
his
fame
as
a
writer
helped
to
injure
his
standing
and
repute
in
he
published
a
paper
which
did
him
even
more
damage
by
appearing
to
justify
the
peculiar
rumours
about
his
private
life
he
held
the
opinion
which
was
universal
at
that
time
that
shakespeare
had
been
abnormally
vicious
he
believed
with
the
majority
of
critics
that
lord
william
herbert
was
addressed
in
the
first
series
of
sonnets
but
his
fine
sensibility
or
if
you
will
his
peculiar
temperament
led
him
to
question
whether
thorpe
dedication
to
could
have
been
addressed
to
lord
william
herbert
he
preferred
the
old
hypothesis
that
the
dedication
was
addressed
to
a
young
actor
named
william
hughes
a
supposition
which
is
supported
by
a
sonnet
he
set
forth
this
idea
with
much
circumstance
and
considerable
ingenuity
in
an
article
which
he
sent
to
me
for
publication
in
the
fortnightly
review
the
theme
was
scabrous
but
his
treatment
of
it
was
scrupulously
reserved
and
adroit
and
i
saw
no
offence
in
the
paper
and
to
tell
the
truth
no
great
ability
in
his
handling
of
the
subject
confer
appendix
criticisms
by
robert
ross
he
had
talked
over
the
article
with
me
while
he
was
writing
it
and
i
told
him
that
i
thought
the
whole
theory
completely
mistaken
shakespeare
was
as
sensual
as
one
could
well
be
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
abnormal
vice
indeed
all
the
evidence
seemed
to
me
to
be
against
this
universal
belief
the
assumption
that
the
dedication
was
addressed
to
lord
william
herbert
i
had
found
it
difficult
to
accept
at
first
the
wording
of
it
is
not
only
ambiguous
but
familiar
if
i
assumed
that
was
meant
for
lord
william
herbert
it
was
only
because
that
seemed
the
easiest
way
out
of
the
maze
in
fine
i
pointed
out
to
oscar
that
his
theory
had
very
little
that
was
new
in
it
and
more
that
was
untrue
and
advised
him
not
to
publish
the
paper
my
conviction
that
shakespeare
was
not
abnormally
vicious
and
that
the
first
series
of
sonnets
proved
snobbishness
and
toadying
and
not
corrupt
passion
seemed
to
oscar
the
very
madness
of
partisanship
he
smiled
away
my
arguments
and
sent
his
paper
to
the
fortnightly
office
when
i
happened
to
be
abroad
much
to
my
chagrin
my
assistant
rejected
it
rudely
whereupon
oscar
sent
it
to
blackwoods
who
published
it
in
their
magazine
it
set
everyone
talking
and
arguing
to
judge
by
the
discussion
it
created
the
wind
of
hatred
and
of
praise
it
caused
one
would
have
thought
that
the
paper
was
a
masterpiece
though
in
truth
it
was
nothing
out
of
the
common
had
it
been
written
by
anybody
else
it
would
have
passed
unnoticed
but
already
oscar
wilde
had
a
prodigious
notoriety
and
all
his
sayings
and
doings
were
eagerly
canvassed
from
one
end
of
society
to
the
other
the
portrait
of
did
oscar
incalculable
injury
it
gave
his
enemies
for
the
first
time
the
very
weapon
they
wanted
and
they
used
it
unscrupulously
and
untiringly
with
the
fierce
delight
of
hatred
oscar
seemed
to
revel
in
the
storm
of
conflicting
opinions
which
the
paper
called
forth
he
understood
better
than
most
men
that
notoriety
is
often
the
forerunner
of
fame
and
is
always
commercially
more
valuable
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
as
the
discussion
grew
bitter
and
enjoyed
even
the
sneering
of
the
envious
a
wind
that
blows
out
a
little
fire
he
knew
plays
bellows
to
a
big
one
so
long
as
people
talked
about
him
he
did
much
care
what
they
said
and
they
certainly
talked
interminably
about
everything
he
wrote
the
inordinate
popular
success
increased
his
and
with
time
his
assurance
took
on
a
touch
of
defiance
the
first
startling
sign
of
this
gradual
change
was
the
publication
in
lippincott
magazine
of
the
picture
of
dorian
gray
it
was
attacked
immediately
in
the
daily
chronicle
a
liberal
paper
usually
distinguished
for
a
certain
leaning
in
favour
of
artists
and
men
of
letters
as
a
tale
spawned
from
the
leprous
literature
of
the
french
decadents
a
poisonous
book
the
atmosphere
of
which
is
heavy
with
the
mephitic
odours
of
moral
and
spiritual
putrefaction
oscar
as
a
matter
of
course
replied
and
the
tone
of
his
reply
is
characteristic
of
his
growth
in
he
no
longer
dreads
the
imputation
of
viciousness
he
challenges
it
it
is
poisonous
if
you
like
but
you
can
not
deny
that
it
is
also
perfect
and
perfection
is
what
we
artists
aim
at
when
oscar
republished
the
picture
of
dorian
gray
in
book
form
in
april
he
sent
me
a
large
paper
copy
and
with
the
copy
he
wrote
a
little
note
asking
me
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
the
book
i
got
the
volume
and
note
early
one
morning
and
read
the
book
until
noon
i
then
sent
him
a
note
by
hand
other
men
i
wrote
have
given
us
wine
some
claret
some
burgundy
some
moselle
you
are
the
first
to
give
us
pure
champagne
much
of
this
book
is
wittier
even
than
congreve
and
on
an
equal
intellectual
level
at
length
it
seems
to
me
you
have
justified
yourself
half
an
hour
later
i
was
told
that
oscar
wilde
had
called
i
went
down
immediately
to
see
him
he
was
bubbling
over
with
content
how
charming
of
you
frank
he
cried
to
have
written
me
such
a
divine
letter
i
have
only
read
a
hundred
pages
of
the
book
i
said
but
they
are
delightful
no
one
now
can
deny
you
a
place
among
the
wittiest
and
most
humorous
writers
in
english
how
wonderful
of
you
frank
what
do
you
like
so
much
like
all
artists
he
loved
praise
and
i
was
enthusiastic
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
of
making
up
for
some
earlier
doubting
that
now
seemed
unworthy
whatever
the
envious
may
say
you
with
burke
and
sheridan
among
the
very
ablest
irishmen
of
course
i
have
heard
most
of
the
epigrams
from
you
before
but
you
have
put
them
even
better
in
this
book
do
you
think
so
really
he
asked
smiling
with
pleasure
it
is
worth
notice
that
some
of
the
epigrams
in
dorian
gray
were
bettered
again
before
they
appeared
in
his
first
play
for
example
in
dorian
gray
lord
henry
wotton
who
is
peculiarly
oscar
mouthpiece
while
telling
how
he
had
to
bargain
for
a
piece
of
old
brocade
in
wardour
street
adds
nowadays
people
know
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing
in
lady
windermere
fan
the
same
epigram
is
perfected
the
cynic
is
one
who
knows
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing
nearly
all
the
literary
productions
of
our
time
suffer
from
haste
one
must
produce
a
good
deal
especially
while
one
reputation
is
in
the
making
in
order
to
live
by
one
pen
yet
great
works
take
time
to
form
and
fine
creations
are
often
disfigured
by
the
stains
of
hurried
parturition
oscar
wilde
contrived
to
minimise
this
disability
by
talking
his
works
before
writing
them
the
conversation
of
lord
henry
wotton
with
his
uncle
and
again
at
lunch
when
he
wishes
to
fascinate
dorian
gray
is
an
excellent
reproduction
of
ordinary
talk
the
uncle
wonders
why
lord
dartmoor
wants
to
marry
an
american
and
grumbles
about
her
people
has
she
got
any
lord
henry
shook
his
head
american
girls
are
as
clever
at
concealing
their
parents
as
english
women
are
at
concealing
their
past
he
said
rising
to
go
they
are
i
suppose
i
hope
so
uncle
george
for
dartmoor
sake
i
am
told
that
is
the
most
lucrative
profession
in
america
after
politics
all
this
seems
to
me
delightful
humour
the
latter
part
of
the
book
however
tails
off
into
insignificance
the
first
hundred
pages
held
the
result
of
months
and
months
of
oscar
talk
the
latter
half
was
written
offhand
to
complete
the
story
dorian
gray
was
the
first
piece
of
work
which
proved
that
oscar
wilde
had
at
length
found
his
true
vein
a
little
study
of
it
discovers
both
his
strength
and
his
weakness
as
a
writer
the
initial
idea
of
the
book
is
excellent
finer
because
deeper
than
the
commonplace
idea
that
is
the
foundation
of
balzac
peau
de
chagrin
though
it
would
probably
never
have
been
written
if
balzac
had
not
written
his
book
first
but
balzac
sincerity
and
earnestness
grapple
with
the
theme
and
wring
a
blessing
out
of
it
whereas
the
subtler
idea
in
oscar
hands
dwindles
gradually
away
till
one
wonders
if
the
book
would
not
have
been
more
effective
as
a
short
story
oscar
did
not
know
life
well
enough
or
care
enough
for
character
to
write
a
profound
psychological
study
he
was
at
his
best
in
a
short
story
or
play
one
day
about
this
time
oscar
first
showed
me
the
aphorisms
he
had
written
as
an
introduction
to
dorian
gray
several
of
them
i
thought
excellent
but
i
found
that
oscar
had
often
repeated
himself
i
cut
these
repetitions
out
and
tried
to
show
him
how
much
better
the
dozen
best
were
than
eighteen
of
which
six
were
inferior
i
added
that
i
should
like
to
publish
the
best
in
the
fortnightly
he
thanked
me
and
said
it
was
very
kind
of
me
next
morning
i
got
a
letter
from
him
telling
me
that
he
had
read
over
my
corrections
and
thought
that
the
aphorisms
i
had
rejected
were
the
best
but
he
hoped
i
publish
them
as
he
had
written
them
naturally
i
replied
that
the
final
judgment
must
rest
with
him
and
i
published
them
at
once
the
delight
i
felt
in
his
undoubted
genius
and
success
was
not
shared
by
others
friends
took
occasion
to
tell
me
that
i
should
not
go
about
with
oscar
wilde
why
not
i
asked
he
has
a
bad
name
was
the
reply
strange
things
are
said
about
him
he
came
down
from
oxford
with
a
vile
reputation
you
have
only
got
to
look
at
the
man
whatever
the
disease
may
be
i
replied
it
not
catching
unfortunately
the
pleasure
men
take
in
denigration
of
the
gifted
is
one
of
the
puzzles
of
life
to
those
who
are
not
envious
men
of
letters
even
people
who
ought
to
have
known
better
were
slow
to
admit
his
extraordinary
talent
he
had
risen
so
quickly
had
been
puffed
into
such
prominence
that
they
felt
inclined
to
deny
him
even
the
gifts
which
he
undoubtedly
possessed
i
was
surprised
once
to
find
a
friend
of
mine
taking
this
attitude
francis
adams
the
poet
and
writer
chaffed
me
one
day
about
my
liking
for
oscar
what
on
earth
can
you
see
in
him
to
admire
he
asked
he
is
not
a
great
writer
he
is
not
even
a
good
writer
his
books
have
no
genius
in
them
his
poetry
is
tenth
rate
and
his
prose
is
not
much
better
his
talk
even
is
fictitious
and
extravagant
i
could
only
laugh
at
him
and
advise
him
to
read
the
picture
of
dorian
gray
this
book
however
gave
oscar
puritanic
enemies
a
better
weapon
against
him
than
even
the
portrait
of
the
subject
they
declared
was
the
same
as
that
of
and
the
treatment
was
simply
loathsome
more
than
one
paper
such
as
in
the
hands
of
jerome
jerome
condemned
the
book
as
corrupt
and
advised
its
suppression
freedom
of
speech
in
england
is
more
feared
than
licence
of
action
a
speck
on
the
outside
of
the
platter
disgusts
your
puritan
and
the
inside
is
never
peeped
at
much
less
discussed
walter
pater
praised
dorian
gray
in
the
bookman
but
thereby
only
did
himself
damage
without
helping
his
friend
oscar
meanwhile
went
about
boldly
meeting
criticism
now
with
smiling
contempt
one
incident
from
this
time
will
show
how
unfairly
he
was
being
judged
and
how
imprudent
he
was
to
front
defamation
with
defiance
one
day
i
met
a
handsome
youth
in
his
company
named
john
gray
and
i
could
not
wonder
that
oscar
found
him
interesting
for
gray
had
not
only
great
personal
distinction
but
charming
manners
and
a
marked
poetic
gift
a
much
greater
gift
than
oscar
possessed
he
had
besides
an
eager
curious
mind
and
of
course
found
extraordinary
stimulus
in
oscar
talk
it
seemed
to
me
that
intellectual
sympathy
and
the
natural
admiration
which
a
younger
man
feels
for
a
brilliant
senior
formed
the
obvious
bond
between
them
but
no
sooner
did
oscar
republish
dorian
gray
than
and
persons
went
about
saying
that
the
eponymous
hero
of
the
book
was
john
gray
though
dorian
gray
was
written
before
oscar
had
met
or
heard
of
john
gray
one
can
not
help
admitting
that
this
was
partly
oscar
own
fault
in
talk
he
often
alluded
laughingly
to
john
gray
as
his
hero
dorian
it
is
just
an
instance
of
the
challenging
contempt
which
he
began
to
use
about
this
time
in
answer
to
the
inventions
of
hatred
late
in
this
year
he
published
four
stories
completely
void
of
offence
calling
the
collection
a
house
of
pomegranates
he
dedicated
each
of
the
tales
to
a
lady
of
distinction
and
the
book
made
many
friends
but
it
was
handled
contemptuously
in
the
press
and
had
no
sale
by
this
time
people
expected
a
certain
sort
of
book
from
oscar
wilde
and
wanted
nothing
else
they
had
to
wait
long
early
in
we
heard
that
oscar
had
written
a
drama
in
french
called
salome
and
at
once
it
was
put
about
that
sarah
bernhardt
was
going
to
produce
it
in
london
then
came
dramatic
surprise
on
surprise
while
it
was
being
rehearsed
the
lord
chamberlain
refused
to
license
it
on
the
ground
that
it
introduced
biblical
characters
oscar
protested
in
a
brilliant
interview
against
the
action
of
the
censor
as
odious
and
ridiculous
he
pointed
out
that
all
the
greatest
artists
painters
and
sculptors
musicians
and
writers
had
taken
many
of
their
best
subjects
from
the
bible
and
wanted
to
know
why
the
dramatist
should
be
prevented
from
treating
the
great
most
proper
to
his
art
when
informed
that
the
interdict
was
to
stand
he
declared
in
a
pet
that
he
would
settle
in
france
and
take
out
letters
of
naturalisation
i
am
not
english
i
am
irish
which
is
quite
another
thing
of
course
the
press
made
all
the
fun
it
could
of
his
show
of
temper
robert
ross
considers
salome
the
most
powerful
and
perfect
of
all
dramas
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
explain
much
less
justify
its
astonishing
popularity
when
it
appeared
the
press
both
in
france
and
in
england
was
critical
and
contemptuous
but
by
this
time
oscar
had
so
captured
the
public
that
he
could
afford
to
disdain
critics
and
calumny
the
play
was
praised
by
his
admirers
as
if
it
had
been
a
masterpiece
and
london
discussed
it
the
more
because
it
was
in
french
and
not
by
the
vulgar
the
indescribable
cold
lewdness
and
cruelty
of
salome
quickened
the
prejudice
and
strengthened
the
dislike
of
the
ordinary
english
reader
for
its
author
and
when
the
drama
was
translated
into
english
and
published
with
the
drawings
of
aubrey
beardsley
it
was
disparaged
and
condemned
by
all
the
leaders
of
literary
opinion
the
colossal
popularity
of
the
play
which
robert
ross
proves
so
triumphantly
came
from
germany
and
russia
and
is
to
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
contempt
educated
germans
and
russians
feel
for
the
hypocritical
vagaries
of
english
prudery
the
illustrations
of
aubrey
beardsley
too
it
must
be
admitted
were
an
additional
offence
to
the
ordinary
english
reader
for
they
intensified
the
peculiar
atmosphere
of
the
drama
oscar
used
to
say
that
he
invented
aubrey
beardsley
but
the
truth
is
it
was
robert
ross
who
first
introduced
aubrey
to
oscar
and
persuaded
him
to
commission
the
salome
drawings
which
gave
the
english
edition
its
singular
value
strange
to
say
oscar
always
hated
the
illustrations
and
would
not
have
the
book
in
his
house
his
dislike
even
extended
to
the
artist
and
as
aubrey
beardsley
was
of
easy
and
agreeable
intercourse
the
mutual
repulsion
deserves
a
word
of
explanation
aubrey
beardsley
genius
had
taken
london
by
storm
at
seventeen
or
eighteen
this
fragile
looking
youth
had
reached
maturity
with
his
astounding
talent
a
talent
which
would
have
given
him
position
and
wealth
in
any
other
country
in
perfection
of
line
his
drawings
were
superior
to
anything
we
possess
but
the
curious
thing
about
the
boy
was
that
he
expressed
the
passions
of
pride
and
lust
and
cruelty
more
intensely
even
than
rops
sic
more
spontaneously
than
anyone
who
ever
held
pencil
beardsley
precocity
was
simply
marvellous
he
seemed
to
have
an
intuitive
understanding
not
only
of
his
own
art
but
of
every
art
and
craft
and
it
was
some
time
before
one
realised
that
he
attained
this
miraculous
virtuosity
by
an
absolute
disdain
for
every
other
form
of
human
endeavour
he
knew
nothing
of
the
great
general
or
millionaire
or
man
of
science
and
he
cared
as
little
for
them
as
for
fishermen
or
the
current
of
his
talent
ran
narrow
between
stone
banks
so
to
speak
it
was
the
bold
assertion
of
it
that
interested
oscar
one
phase
of
beardsley
extraordinary
development
may
be
recorded
here
when
i
first
met
him
his
letters
and
even
his
talk
sometimes
were
curiously
youthful
and
immature
lacking
altogether
the
personal
note
of
his
drawings
as
soon
as
this
was
noticed
he
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
pretended
that
his
style
in
writing
was
out
of
date
he
wished
us
to
believe
that
he
hesitated
to
shock
us
with
his
archaic
sympathies
of
course
we
laughed
and
challenged
him
to
reveal
himself
shortly
afterwards
i
got
an
article
from
him
written
with
curious
felicity
of
phrase
in
modish
polite
english
he
had
reached
personal
expression
in
a
new
medium
in
a
month
or
so
and
apparently
without
effort
it
was
beardsley
writing
that
first
won
oscar
to
recognition
of
his
talent
and
for
a
while
he
seemed
vaguely
interested
in
what
he
called
his
personality
they
were
both
at
lunch
one
day
when
oscar
declared
that
he
could
drink
nothing
but
absinthe
when
beardsley
was
present
absinthe
he
said
is
to
all
other
drinks
what
aubrey
drawings
are
to
other
pictures
it
stands
alone
it
is
like
nothing
else
it
shimmers
like
southern
twilight
in
opalescent
colouring
it
has
about
it
the
seduction
of
strange
sins
it
is
stronger
than
any
other
spirit
and
brings
out
the
conscious
self
in
man
it
is
just
like
your
drawings
aubrey
it
gets
on
nerves
and
is
cruel
baudelaire
called
his
poems
fleurs
du
mal
i
shall
call
your
drawings
fleurs
du
peche
flowers
of
sin
when
i
have
before
me
one
of
your
drawings
i
want
to
drink
absinthe
which
changes
colour
like
jade
in
sunlight
and
takes
the
senses
thrall
and
then
i
can
live
myself
back
in
imperial
rome
in
the
rome
of
the
later
caesars
do
forget
the
simple
pleasures
of
that
life
oscar
said
aubrey
nero
set
christians
on
fire
like
large
tallow
candles
the
only
light
christians
have
ever
been
known
to
give
he
added
in
a
languid
gentle
voice
this
talk
gave
me
the
key
in
personal
intercourse
oscar
wilde
was
more
english
than
the
english
he
seldom
expressed
his
opinion
of
person
or
prejudice
boldly
he
preferred
to
hint
dislike
and
disapproval
his
insistence
on
the
naked
expression
of
lust
and
cruelty
in
beardsley
drawings
showed
me
that
direct
frankness
displeased
him
for
he
could
hardly
object
to
the
qualities
which
were
making
his
own
salome
the
complete
history
of
the
relations
between
oscar
wilde
and
beardsley
and
their
mutual
dislike
merely
proves
how
difficult
it
is
for
original
artists
to
appreciate
one
another
like
mountain
peaks
they
stand
alone
oscar
showed
a
touch
of
patronage
the
superiority
of
the
senior
in
his
intercourse
with
beardsley
and
often
praised
him
ineptly
whereas
beardsley
to
the
last
spoke
of
oscar
as
a
showman
and
hoped
drily
that
he
knew
more
about
literature
than
he
did
about
art
for
a
moment
they
worked
in
concert
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
was
beardsley
who
influenced
oscar
and
not
oscar
who
influenced
beardsley
beardsley
contempt
of
critics
and
the
public
his
artistic
boldness
and
had
a
certain
hardening
influence
on
oscar
as
things
turned
out
a
most
unfortunate
influence
in
spite
of
robert
ross
opinion
i
regard
salome
as
a
student
work
an
outcome
of
oscar
admiration
for
flaubert
and
his
herodias
on
the
one
hand
and
les
sept
princesses
of
maeterlinck
on
the
other
he
has
borrowed
the
colour
and
oriental
cruelty
with
the
from
the
frenchman
and
from
the
fleming
the
simplicity
of
language
and
the
haunting
effect
produced
by
the
repetition
of
significant
phrases
yet
salome
is
original
through
the
mingling
of
lust
and
hatred
in
the
heroine
and
by
making
this
extraordinary
virgin
the
chief
and
centre
of
the
drama
oscar
has
heightened
the
interest
of
the
story
and
bettered
flaubert
design
i
feel
sure
he
copied
simplicity
of
style
because
it
served
to
disguise
his
imperfect
knowledge
of
french
and
yet
this
very
artlessness
adds
to
the
weird
effect
of
the
drama
the
lust
that
inspires
the
tragedy
was
characteristic
but
the
cruelty
was
foreign
to
oscar
both
qualities
would
have
injured
him
in
england
had
it
not
been
for
two
things
first
of
all
only
a
few
of
the
best
class
of
english
people
know
french
at
all
well
and
for
the
most
part
they
disdain
the
morality
of
their
race
while
the
vast
mass
of
the
english
public
regard
french
as
in
itself
an
immoral
medium
and
is
inclined
to
treat
anything
in
that
tongue
with
contemptuous
indifference
one
can
only
say
that
salome
confirmed
oscar
growing
reputation
for
abnormal
viciousness
it
was
in
that
some
of
oscar
friends
struck
me
for
the
first
time
as
questionable
to
say
the
best
of
them
i
remember
giving
a
little
dinner
to
some
men
in
rooms
i
had
in
jermyn
street
i
invited
oscar
and
he
brought
a
young
friend
with
him
after
dinner
i
noticed
that
the
youth
was
angry
with
oscar
and
would
scarcely
speak
to
him
and
that
oscar
was
making
up
to
him
i
heard
snatches
of
pleading
from
oscar
i
beg
of
you
it
is
not
true
you
have
no
cause
all
the
while
oscar
was
standing
apart
from
the
rest
of
us
with
an
arm
on
the
young
man
shoulder
but
his
coaxing
was
in
vain
the
youth
turned
away
with
petulant
sullen
this
is
a
mere
which
remained
in
my
memory
and
made
me
ask
myself
afterwards
how
i
could
have
been
so
slow
of
understanding
looking
back
and
taking
everything
into
consideration
his
social
success
the
glare
of
publicity
in
which
he
lived
the
buzz
of
talk
and
discussion
that
arose
about
everything
he
did
and
said
the
increasing
interest
and
value
of
his
work
and
above
all
the
boldness
of
his
writing
and
the
challenge
of
his
conduct
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
black
cloud
of
hate
and
slander
which
attended
him
persistently
became
more
and
more
threatening
chapter
ix
the
summer
of
success
oscar
first
play
no
season
it
is
said
is
so
beautiful
as
the
brief
northern
summer
fourths
of
the
year
is
cold
and
dark
and
the
landscape
is
swept
by
snowstorm
and
blizzard
summer
comes
like
a
goddess
in
a
twinkling
the
snow
vanishes
and
nature
puts
on
her
robes
of
tenderest
green
the
birds
arrive
in
flocks
flowers
spring
to
life
on
all
sides
and
the
sun
shines
by
night
as
by
day
such
a
summertide
so
beautiful
and
so
brief
was
accorded
to
oscar
wilde
before
the
final
desolation
i
want
to
give
a
picture
of
him
at
the
topmost
height
of
happy
hours
which
will
afford
some
proof
of
his
magical
talent
of
speech
besides
my
own
appreciation
of
it
and
fortunately
the
incident
has
been
given
to
me
ernest
beckett
now
lord
grimthorpe
a
lover
of
all
superiorities
who
has
known
the
ablest
men
of
the
time
takes
pleasure
in
telling
a
story
which
shows
oscar
influence
over
men
who
were
anything
but
literary
in
their
tastes
beckett
had
a
party
of
yorkshire
squires
chiefly
and
lovers
of
an
outdoor
life
at
kirkstall
grange
when
he
heard
that
oscar
wilde
was
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
leeds
immediately
he
asked
him
to
lunch
at
the
grange
chuckling
to
himself
beforehand
at
the
sensational
novelty
of
the
experiment
next
day
oscar
wilde
was
announced
and
as
he
came
into
the
room
the
sportsmen
forthwith
began
hiding
themselves
behind
newspapers
or
moving
together
in
groups
in
order
to
avoid
seeing
or
being
introduced
to
the
notorious
writer
oscar
shook
hands
with
his
host
as
if
he
had
noticed
nothing
and
began
to
talk
in
five
minutes
grimthorpe
declares
all
the
papers
were
put
down
and
everyone
had
gathered
round
him
to
listen
and
laugh
at
the
end
of
the
meal
one
yorkshireman
after
the
other
begged
the
host
to
follow
the
lunch
with
a
dinner
and
invite
them
to
meet
the
wonder
again
when
the
party
broke
up
in
the
small
hours
they
all
went
away
delighted
with
oscar
vowing
that
no
man
ever
talked
more
brilliantly
grimthorpe
can
not
remember
a
single
word
oscar
said
it
was
all
delightful
he
declares
a
play
of
genial
humour
over
every
topic
that
came
up
like
sunshine
dancing
on
waves
the
extraordinary
thing
about
oscar
talent
was
that
he
did
not
monopolise
the
conversation
he
took
the
ball
of
talk
wherever
it
happened
to
be
at
the
moment
and
played
with
it
so
humorously
that
everyone
was
soon
smiling
delightedly
the
famous
talkers
of
the
past
coleridge
macaulay
carlyle
and
the
others
were
all
lecturers
talk
to
them
was
a
discourse
on
a
favourite
theme
and
in
ordinary
life
they
were
generally
regarded
as
bores
but
at
his
best
oscar
wilde
never
dropped
the
tone
of
good
society
he
could
afford
to
give
place
to
others
he
was
equipped
at
all
points
no
subject
came
amiss
to
him
he
saw
everything
from
a
humorous
angle
and
dazzled
one
now
with
now
with
the
very
stuff
of
merriment
though
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
every
social
gathering
and
in
constant
demand
he
still
read
omnivorously
and
his
mind
naturally
occupied
itself
with
high
themes
for
some
years
the
story
of
jesus
fascinated
him
and
tinged
all
his
thought
we
were
talking
about
renan
life
one
day
a
wonderful
book
he
called
it
one
of
the
three
great
biographies
of
the
world
plato
dialogues
with
socrates
as
hero
and
boswell
life
of
johnson
being
the
other
two
it
was
strange
he
thought
that
the
greatest
man
had
written
the
worst
biography
plato
made
of
socrates
a
mere
phonograph
into
which
he
talked
his
own
theories
renan
did
better
work
and
boswell
the
humble
loving
friend
the
least
talented
of
the
three
did
better
still
though
being
english
he
had
to
keep
to
the
surface
of
things
and
leave
the
depths
to
be
divined
oscar
evidently
expected
plato
and
renan
to
have
surpassed
comparison
it
seemed
to
me
however
that
the
illiterate
galilean
fishermen
had
proved
themselves
still
more
consummate
painters
than
boswell
though
they
too
left
a
great
deal
too
much
to
the
imagination
love
is
the
best
of
artists
the
puddle
of
rain
in
the
road
can
reflect
a
piece
of
sky
marvellously
the
gospel
story
had
a
personal
interest
for
oscar
he
was
always
weaving
little
fables
about
himself
as
the
master
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
hebrew
the
story
of
jesus
had
always
had
the
strongest
attraction
for
me
and
so
we
often
talked
about
him
though
from
opposite
poles
renan
i
felt
had
missed
jesus
at
his
highest
he
was
far
below
the
sincerity
the
tenderness
and
wisdom
of
that
divine
spirit
like
he
stumbled
over
the
miracles
and
came
to
grief
claus
sluter
head
of
jesus
in
the
museum
of
dijon
is
a
finer
portrait
and
so
is
the
imaginative
picture
of
fra
angelico
it
seemed
to
me
possible
to
do
a
sketch
from
the
gospels
themselves
which
should
show
the
growth
of
the
soul
of
jesus
and
so
impose
itself
as
a
true
portrait
oscar
interest
in
the
theme
was
different
he
put
himself
frankly
in
the
place
of
his
model
and
appeared
to
enjoy
the
jarring
antinomy
which
resulted
one
or
two
of
his
stories
were
surprising
in
ironical
suggestion
surprising
too
because
they
showed
his
convinced
paganism
here
is
one
which
reveals
his
exact
position
when
joseph
of
arimathea
came
down
in
the
evening
from
mount
calvary
where
jesus
had
died
he
saw
on
a
white
stone
a
young
man
seated
weeping
and
joseph
went
near
him
and
said
understand
how
great
thy
grief
must
be
for
certainly
that
man
was
a
just
man
but
the
young
man
made
answer
it
is
not
for
that
i
am
weeping
i
am
weeping
because
i
too
have
wrought
miracles
i
also
have
given
sight
to
the
blind
i
have
healed
the
palsied
and
i
have
raised
the
dead
i
too
have
caused
the
barren
fig
tree
to
wither
away
and
i
have
turned
water
into
wine
and
yet
they
have
not
crucified
me
at
the
time
this
apologue
amused
me
in
the
light
of
later
events
it
assumed
a
tragic
significance
oscar
wilde
ought
to
have
known
that
in
this
world
every
real
superiority
is
pursued
with
hatred
and
every
worker
of
miracles
is
sure
to
be
persecuted
but
he
had
no
inkling
that
the
gospel
story
is
symbolic
the
of
genius
for
all
time
eternally
true
he
never
looked
outside
himself
and
as
the
fruits
of
success
were
now
sweet
in
his
mouth
a
pursuing
fate
seemed
to
him
the
most
mythical
of
myths
his
was
pathetic
the
laws
that
govern
human
affairs
had
little
interest
for
the
man
who
was
always
a
law
unto
himself
yet
by
some
extraordinary
prescience
some
inexplicable
presentiment
the
approaching
catastrophe
cast
its
shadow
over
his
mind
and
he
felt
vaguely
that
the
of
genius
would
be
incomplete
and
farcical
without
the
final
tragedy
whoever
lives
for
the
highest
must
be
crucified
it
seems
memorable
to
me
that
in
this
brief
summer
of
his
life
oscar
wilde
should
have
concerned
himself
especially
with
the
of
the
man
of
sorrows
who
had
sounded
all
the
depths
of
suffering
just
when
he
himself
was
about
to
enter
the
dark
valley
jesus
was
often
in
his
thoughts
and
he
always
spoke
of
him
with
admiration
but
after
all
how
could
he
help
it
even
dekker
saw
as
far
as
that
the
best
of
men
that
wore
earth
about
him
this
was
the
deeper
strain
in
oscar
wilde
nature
though
he
was
always
disinclined
to
show
it
habitually
he
lived
in
humorous
talk
in
the
epithets
and
epigrams
he
struck
out
in
the
desire
to
please
and
astonish
his
hearers
one
evening
i
learned
almost
by
chance
that
he
was
about
to
try
a
new
experiment
and
break
into
a
new
field
he
took
up
the
word
lose
at
the
table
i
remember
we
lose
our
chances
he
said
laughing
we
lose
our
figures
we
even
lose
our
characters
but
we
must
never
lose
our
temper
that
is
our
duty
to
our
neighbour
frank
but
sometimes
we
mislay
it
do
we
is
that
going
in
a
book
oscar
i
asked
smiling
or
in
an
article
you
have
written
nothing
lately
i
have
a
play
in
my
mind
he
replied
gravely
i
am
going
to
shut
myself
up
in
my
room
and
stay
there
until
it
is
written
george
alexander
has
been
bothering
me
to
write
a
play
for
some
time
and
i
got
an
idea
i
rather
like
i
wonder
can
i
do
it
in
a
week
or
will
it
take
three
it
ought
not
to
take
long
to
beat
the
pineros
and
the
joneses
it
always
annoyed
oscar
when
any
other
name
but
his
came
into
men
mouths
his
vanity
was
extraordinarily
alert
naturally
enough
he
minimised
alexander
initiative
the
actor
had
bothered
oscar
by
advancing
him
before
the
scenario
was
even
outlined
a
couple
of
months
later
he
told
me
that
alexander
had
accepted
his
comedy
and
was
going
to
produce
lady
windermere
fan
i
thought
the
title
excellent
territorial
names
oscar
explained
gravely
have
always
a
cachet
of
distinction
they
fall
on
the
ear
full
toned
with
secular
dignity
that
how
i
get
all
the
names
of
my
personages
frank
i
take
up
a
map
of
the
english
counties
and
there
they
are
our
english
villages
have
often
exquisitely
beautiful
names
windermere
for
instance
or
hunstanton
and
he
rolled
the
syllables
over
his
tongue
with
a
soft
sensual
pleasure
i
had
a
box
the
first
night
and
thinking
it
might
do
oscar
some
good
i
took
with
me
arthur
walter
of
the
times
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
was
as
old
as
the
hills
but
the
treatment
gave
charm
to
it
if
not
freshness
the
delightful
unexpected
humour
set
off
the
commonplace
incident
but
it
was
only
the
convention
that
arthur
walter
would
see
the
play
was
poor
he
thought
which
brought
me
to
wonder
after
the
first
act
i
went
downstairs
to
the
foyer
and
found
the
critics
in
much
the
same
mind
there
was
an
enormous
gentleman
called
joseph
knight
who
cried
out
the
humour
is
mechanical
unreal
seeing
that
i
did
not
respond
he
challenged
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
that
is
for
you
critics
to
answer
i
replied
i
might
say
he
laughed
in
oscar
own
peculiar
way
promise
and
less
performance
ha
ha
ha
that
the
exact
opposite
to
oscar
way
i
retorted
it
is
the
listeners
who
laugh
at
his
humour
come
now
really
cried
knight
you
can
not
think
much
of
the
play
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
began
to
realise
that
nine
critics
out
of
ten
are
incapable
of
judging
original
work
they
seem
to
live
in
a
sort
of
fog
waiting
for
someone
to
give
them
the
lead
and
accordingly
they
love
to
discuss
every
new
play
right
and
left
i
have
not
seen
the
whole
play
i
answered
i
was
not
at
any
of
the
rehearsals
but
so
far
it
is
surely
the
best
comedy
in
english
the
most
brilliant
is
it
the
big
man
started
back
and
stared
at
me
then
burst
out
laughing
that
good
he
cried
with
a
loud
unmirthful
guffaw
windermere
better
than
any
comedy
of
shakespeare
ha
ha
ha
brilliant
ho
ho
yes
i
persisted
angered
by
his
disdain
wittier
and
more
humorous
than
you
like
it
or
ado
strange
to
say
too
it
is
on
a
higher
intellectual
level
i
can
only
compare
it
to
the
best
of
congreve
and
i
think
it
better
with
a
grunt
of
disapproval
or
rage
the
great
man
of
the
daily
press
turned
away
to
exchange
bleatings
with
one
of
his
confreres
the
audience
was
a
picked
audience
of
the
best
heads
in
london
far
superior
in
brains
therefore
to
the
average
journalist
and
their
judgment
was
that
it
was
a
most
brilliant
and
interesting
play
though
the
humour
was
often
prepared
the
construction
showed
a
rare
mastery
of
oscar
wilde
had
at
length
come
into
his
kingdom
at
the
end
the
author
was
called
for
and
oscar
appeared
before
the
curtain
the
house
rose
at
him
and
cheered
and
cheered
again
he
was
smiling
with
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
wholly
master
of
himself
and
his
audience
i
am
so
glad
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
you
like
my
play
confer
appendix
criticisms
by
robert
ross
i
feel
sure
you
estimate
the
merits
of
it
almost
as
highly
as
i
do
myself
the
house
rocked
with
laughter
the
play
and
its
humour
were
a
seven
wonder
in
london
people
talked
of
nothing
but
lady
windermere
fan
the
witty
words
in
it
ran
from
lip
to
lip
like
a
tidbit
of
scandal
some
clever
jewesses
and
strange
to
say
one
scotchman
were
the
loudest
in
applause
archer
the
critic
of
the
world
was
the
first
and
only
journalist
to
perceive
that
the
play
was
a
classic
by
virtue
of
genuine
dramatic
qualities
leverson
turned
the
humorous
sayings
into
current
social
coin
in
punch
of
all
places
in
the
world
and
from
a
favourite
oscar
wilde
rapidly
became
the
idol
of
smart
london
the
play
was
an
intellectual
triumph
this
time
oscar
had
not
only
won
success
but
had
won
also
the
suffrages
of
the
best
nearly
all
the
were
against
him
and
made
themselves
ridiculous
by
their
brainless
strictures
truth
and
the
times
for
example
were
poisonously
puritanic
but
thinking
people
came
over
to
his
side
in
a
body
the
halo
of
fame
was
about
him
and
the
incense
of
it
in
his
nostrils
made
him
more
charming
more
irresponsibly
gay
more
than
ever
he
was
as
one
set
upon
a
pinnacle
with
the
sunshine
playing
about
him
lighting
up
his
radiant
eyes
all
the
while
however
the
foul
mists
from
the
underworld
were
wreathing
about
him
climbing
higher
and
higher
chapter
x
the
first
meeting
with
lord
alfred
douglas
thou
hast
led
me
like
an
heathen
sacrifice
with
music
and
with
fatal
pomp
of
flowers
to
my
eternal
webster
the
white
devil
lady
windermere
fan
was
a
success
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
during
its
run
london
was
at
oscar
feet
there
were
always
a
few
doors
closed
to
him
but
he
could
afford
now
to
treat
his
critics
with
laughter
call
them
fogies
and
and
explain
that
they
had
not
a
decalogue
but
a
millelogue
of
sins
forbidden
and
persons
tabooed
because
it
was
easier
to
condemn
than
to
understand
i
remember
a
lunch
once
when
he
talked
most
brilliantly
and
finished
up
by
telling
the
story
now
published
in
his
works
as
a
florentine
tragedy
he
told
it
superbly
making
it
appear
far
more
effective
than
in
its
written
form
a
actor
piqued
at
being
compelled
to
play
listener
made
himself
ridiculous
by
half
turning
his
back
on
the
narrator
but
after
lunch
willie
grenfell
now
lord
desborough
a
model
english
athlete
gifted
with
peculiar
intellectual
fairness
came
round
to
me
oscar
wilde
is
most
surprising
most
charming
a
wonderful
talker
at
the
same
moment
h
came
over
to
us
he
was
a
man
who
went
everywhere
and
knew
everyone
he
had
quiet
ingratiating
manners
always
spoke
in
a
gentle
smiling
way
and
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
everyone
especially
for
women
he
was
a
bachelor
too
and
wholly
unattached
he
surprised
me
by
taking
up
grenfell
praise
and
breaking
into
a
lyric
the
best
talker
who
ever
lived
he
said
most
extraordinary
i
am
so
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
asking
me
to
meet
him
a
new
delight
he
brings
a
supernal
air
into
life
i
am
in
truth
indebted
to
you
all
this
in
an
affected
purring
tone
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
a
touch
of
rouge
on
his
face
grenfell
turned
away
from
us
rather
abruptly
i
thought
at
this
first
roseate
dawn
of
complete
success
and
universal
applause
new
qualities
came
to
view
in
oscar
praise
gave
him
the
fillip
needed
in
order
to
make
him
surpass
himself
his
talk
took
on
a
sort
of
autumnal
richness
of
colour
and
assumed
a
new
width
of
range
he
now
used
pathos
as
well
as
humour
and
generally
brought
in
a
story
or
apologue
to
lend
variety
to
the
entertainment
his
little
weaknesses
too
began
to
show
themselves
and
they
grew
rankly
in
the
sunshine
he
always
wanted
to
do
himself
well
as
the
phrase
goes
but
now
he
began
to
eat
and
drink
more
freely
than
before
his
vanity
became
defiant
i
noticed
one
day
that
he
had
signed
himself
oscar
wilde
i
think
under
some
verses
which
he
had
contributed
years
before
to
his
college
magazine
i
asked
him
jokingly
what
the
stood
for
to
my
astonishment
he
answered
me
gravely
the
were
kings
in
ireland
and
i
have
a
right
to
the
name
i
am
descended
from
them
i
could
not
help
it
i
burst
out
laughing
what
are
you
laughing
at
frank
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
annoyance
it
seems
humorous
to
me
i
explained
that
oscar
wilde
should
want
to
be
an
and
as
i
spoke
a
picture
of
the
greatest
of
the
with
bushy
head
and
dirty
rags
warming
enormous
hairy
legs
before
a
smoking
flashed
before
me
i
think
something
of
the
sort
must
have
occurred
to
oscar
too
for
in
spite
of
his
attempt
to
be
grave
he
could
not
help
laughing
it
unkind
of
you
frank
he
said
the
irish
were
civilised
and
christians
when
the
english
kept
themselves
warm
with
tattooings
he
could
not
help
telling
one
in
familiar
talk
of
clumber
or
some
other
great
house
where
he
had
been
visiting
he
was
intoxicated
with
his
own
popularity
a
little
surprised
perhaps
to
find
that
he
had
won
fame
so
easily
and
on
the
primrose
path
but
one
could
forgive
him
everything
for
he
talked
more
delightfully
than
ever
it
is
almost
inexplicable
but
nevertheless
true
that
life
tries
all
of
us
tests
every
weak
point
to
breaking
and
sets
off
and
exaggerates
our
powers
burns
saw
this
when
he
wrote
wha
does
the
utmost
that
he
can
will
whyles
do
mair
and
the
obverse
is
true
whoever
yields
to
a
weakness
habitually
some
day
goes
further
than
he
ever
intended
and
comes
to
worse
grief
than
he
deserved
the
old
prayer
lead
us
not
into
temptation
is
perhaps
a
recognition
of
this
fact
but
we
moderns
are
inclined
to
walk
heedlessly
no
longer
believing
in
pitfalls
or
in
the
danger
of
gratified
desires
and
oscar
wilde
was
not
only
an
unbeliever
but
he
had
all
the
heedless
confidence
of
the
artist
who
has
won
popularity
and
has
the
halo
of
fame
on
his
brow
with
high
heart
and
smiling
eyes
he
went
to
his
fate
unsuspecting
it
was
in
the
autumn
of
that
he
first
met
lord
alfred
douglas
he
was
and
lord
alfred
douglas
a
handsome
slim
youth
of
with
large
blue
eyes
and
hair
his
mother
the
dowager
lady
queensberry
preserves
a
photograph
of
him
taken
a
few
years
before
when
he
was
still
at
winchester
a
boy
of
sixteen
with
an
expression
which
might
well
be
called
angelic
when
i
met
him
he
was
still
girlishly
pretty
with
the
beauty
of
youth
coloring
and
fair
skin
though
his
features
were
merely
ordinary
it
was
lionel
johnson
the
writer
a
friend
and
intimate
of
douglas
at
winchester
who
brought
him
to
tea
at
oscar
house
in
tite
street
their
mutual
attraction
had
countless
hooks
oscar
was
drawn
by
the
lad
personal
beauty
and
enormously
affected
besides
by
lord
alfred
douglas
name
and
position
he
was
a
snob
as
only
an
english
artist
can
be
a
snob
he
loved
titular
distinctions
and
douglas
is
one
of
the
few
great
names
in
british
history
with
the
gilding
of
romance
about
it
no
doubt
oscar
talked
better
than
his
best
because
he
was
talking
to
lord
alfred
douglas
to
the
last
the
mere
name
rolled
on
his
tongue
gave
him
extraordinary
pleasure
besides
the
boy
admired
him
hung
upon
his
lips
with
his
soul
in
his
eyes
showed
too
rare
intelligence
in
his
appreciation
confessed
that
he
himself
wrote
verses
and
loved
letters
passionately
could
more
be
desired
than
perfection
perfected
and
alfred
douglas
on
his
side
was
almost
as
powerfully
attracted
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
all
her
literary
tastes
and
more
he
was
already
a
with
a
singing
faculty
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
greatest
what
wonder
if
he
took
this
magical
talker
with
the
luminous
eyes
and
charming
voice
and
a
range
and
play
of
thought
beyond
his
imagining
for
a
miracle
one
of
the
immortals
before
he
had
listened
long
i
have
been
told
the
youth
declared
his
admiration
passionately
they
were
an
extraordinary
pair
and
were
complementary
in
a
hundred
ways
not
only
in
mind
but
in
character
oscar
had
reached
originality
of
thought
and
possessed
the
culture
of
scholarship
while
alfred
douglas
had
youth
and
rank
and
beauty
besides
being
as
articulate
as
a
woman
with
an
unsurpassable
gift
of
expression
curiously
enough
oscar
was
as
yielding
and
amiable
in
character
as
the
boy
was
reckless
obstinate
and
imperious
years
later
oscar
told
me
that
from
the
first
he
dreaded
alfred
aristocratic
insolent
boldness
he
frightened
me
frank
as
much
as
he
attracted
me
and
i
held
away
from
him
but
he
would
have
it
he
sought
me
out
again
and
again
and
i
could
resist
him
that
is
my
only
fault
that
what
ruined
me
he
increased
my
expenses
so
that
i
could
not
meet
them
over
and
over
again
i
tried
to
free
myself
from
him
but
he
came
back
and
i
yielded
alas
though
this
is
oscar
later
gloss
on
what
actually
happened
it
is
fairly
accurate
he
was
never
able
to
realise
how
his
meeting
with
lord
alfred
douglas
had
changed
the
world
to
him
and
him
to
the
world
the
effect
on
the
harder
fibre
of
the
boy
was
chiefly
mental
to
alfred
douglas
oscar
was
merely
a
quickening
inspiring
intellectual
influence
but
the
boy
effect
on
oscar
was
of
character
and
induced
imitation
lord
alfred
douglas
boldness
gave
oscar
an
insolent
arrogance
he
tried
to
outdo
his
model
in
aristocratic
disdain
without
knowing
the
cause
the
change
in
oscar
astonished
me
again
and
again
and
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
i
shall
have
to
notice
many
instances
of
it
one
other
effect
the
friendship
had
of
influence
oscar
always
enjoyed
good
living
but
for
years
he
had
had
to
earn
his
bread
he
knew
the
value
of
money
he
did
like
to
throw
it
away
he
was
accustomed
to
lunch
or
dine
at
a
cheap
italian
restaurant
for
a
few
shillings
but
to
lord
alfred
douglas
money
was
only
a
counter
and
the
most
luxurious
living
a
necessity
as
soon
as
oscar
wilde
began
to
entertain
him
he
was
led
to
the
dearest
hotels
and
restaurants
his
expenses
became
formidable
and
soon
outran
his
large
earnings
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
known
him
he
borrowed
heedlessly
right
and
left
and
had
therefore
to
bring
forth
play
after
play
with
scant
time
for
thought
lord
alfred
douglas
has
declared
recently
i
spent
much
more
in
entertaining
oscar
wilde
than
he
did
in
entertaining
me
but
this
is
preposterous
an
earlier
confession
of
his
was
much
nearer
the
truth
it
was
a
sweet
humiliation
to
me
to
let
oscar
wilde
pay
for
everything
and
to
ask
him
for
money
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
lord
alfred
douglas
habitual
extravagance
kept
oscar
wilde
hard
up
and
drove
him
to
write
without
intermission
there
were
other
and
worse
results
of
the
intimacy
which
need
not
be
exposed
here
in
so
many
words
though
they
must
be
indicated
for
they
derived
of
necessity
from
that
increased
which
has
already
been
recorded
as
oscar
devoted
himself
to
lord
alfred
douglas
and
went
about
with
him
continually
he
came
to
know
his
friends
and
his
familiars
and
went
less
into
society
again
and
again
lord
alfred
douglas
flaunted
acquaintance
with
youths
of
the
lowest
class
but
no
one
knew
him
or
paid
much
attention
to
him
oscar
wilde
on
the
other
hand
was
already
a
famous
personage
whose
every
movement
provoked
comment
from
this
time
on
the
rumours
about
oscar
took
definite
form
and
shaped
themselves
in
specific
accusations
his
enemies
began
triumphantly
to
predict
his
ruin
and
disgrace
everything
is
known
in
london
society
like
water
on
sand
the
truth
spreads
wider
and
wider
as
it
gradually
filters
lower
the
smart
set
in
london
has
almost
as
keen
a
love
of
scandal
as
a
cathedral
town
about
this
time
one
heard
of
a
dinner
which
oscar
wilde
had
given
at
a
restaurant
in
soho
which
was
said
to
have
degenerated
into
a
sort
of
roman
orgy
i
was
told
of
a
man
who
tried
to
get
money
by
blackmailing
him
in
his
own
house
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
at
all
these
scandals
and
asked
the
talebearers
what
had
been
said
about
shakespeare
to
make
him
rave
as
he
raved
again
and
again
against
calumny
and
when
they
persisted
in
their
malicious
stories
i
could
do
nothing
but
show
disbelief
though
i
saw
but
little
of
oscar
during
the
first
year
or
so
of
his
intimacy
with
lord
alfred
douglas
one
scene
from
this
time
filled
me
with
suspicion
and
an
undefined
dread
i
was
in
a
corner
of
the
cafe
royal
one
night
downstairs
playing
chess
and
while
waiting
for
my
opponent
to
move
i
went
out
just
to
stretch
my
legs
when
i
returned
i
found
oscar
throned
in
the
very
corner
between
two
youths
even
to
my
eyes
they
appeared
quite
common
in
fact
they
looked
like
grooms
in
spite
of
their
vulgar
appearance
however
one
was
nice
looking
in
a
fresh
boyish
way
the
other
seemed
merely
depraved
oscar
greeted
me
as
usual
though
he
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
i
resumed
my
seat
which
was
almost
opposite
him
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
the
game
to
my
astonishment
he
was
talking
as
well
as
if
he
had
had
a
picked
audience
talking
if
you
please
about
the
olympic
games
telling
how
the
youths
wrestled
and
were
scraped
with
strigulae
and
threw
the
discus
and
ran
races
and
won
the
his
impassioned
eloquence
brought
the
palaestra
before
one
with
a
magic
of
representment
suddenly
the
younger
of
the
boys
asked
did
you
sy
they
was
niked
of
course
oscar
replied
nude
clothed
only
in
sunshine
and
beauty
oh
my
giggled
the
lad
in
his
unspeakable
cockney
way
i
could
not
stand
it
i
am
in
an
impossible
position
i
said
to
my
opponent
who
was
the
amateur
chess
player
montagu
gattie
come
along
and
let
us
have
some
dinner
with
a
nod
to
oscar
i
left
the
place
on
the
way
out
gattie
said
to
me
so
that
the
famous
oscar
wilde
yes
i
replied
that
oscar
but
i
never
saw
him
in
such
company
before
did
you
remarked
gattie
quietly
he
was
well
known
at
oxford
i
was
at
the
with
him
his
reputation
was
always
rather
shall
we
call
it
i
wanted
to
forget
the
scene
and
blot
it
out
of
my
memory
and
remember
my
friend
as
i
knew
him
at
his
best
but
that
cockney
boy
would
not
be
banned
he
leered
there
with
rosy
cheeks
hair
plastered
down
in
a
on
his
forehead
and
low
cunning
eyes
i
felt
uncomfortable
i
would
not
think
of
it
i
recalled
the
fact
that
in
all
our
talks
i
had
never
heard
oscar
use
a
gross
word
his
mind
i
said
to
myself
is
like
spenser
vowed
away
from
coarseness
and
vulgarity
he
the
most
perfect
intellectual
companion
in
the
world
he
may
have
wanted
to
talk
to
the
boys
just
to
see
what
effect
his
talk
would
have
on
them
his
vanity
is
greedy
enough
to
desire
even
such
applause
as
theirs
of
course
that
was
the
explanation
vanity
my
affection
for
him
tormented
by
doubt
had
found
at
length
a
satisfactory
solution
it
was
the
artist
in
him
i
said
to
myself
that
wanted
a
model
but
why
not
boys
of
his
own
class
the
answer
suggested
itself
boys
of
his
own
class
could
teach
him
nothing
his
own
boyhood
would
supply
him
with
all
the
necessary
information
about
youth
but
if
he
wanted
a
in
one
of
his
plays
he
would
have
to
find
a
and
paint
him
from
life
that
was
probably
the
truth
i
concluded
so
satisfied
was
i
with
my
discovery
that
i
developed
it
to
gattie
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
gattie
has
nothing
of
the
artist
in
him
i
decided
and
therefore
can
not
understand
and
i
went
on
arguing
if
gattie
were
right
why
two
boys
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
my
reading
of
the
riddle
was
the
only
plausible
one
besides
it
left
my
affection
unaffected
and
free
still
the
giggle
the
plastered
oily
hair
and
the
venal
leering
eyes
came
back
to
me
again
and
again
in
spite
of
myself
chapter
xi
the
threatening
cloud
draws
nearer
there
is
a
secret
apprehension
in
man
counselling
sobriety
and
moderation
a
fear
born
of
expediency
distinct
from
conscience
which
is
ethical
though
it
seems
to
be
closely
connected
with
conscience
acting
as
it
does
by
warnings
and
prohibitions
the
story
of
polycrates
and
his
ring
is
a
symbol
of
the
instinctive
feeling
that
extraordinary
good
fortune
is
perilous
and
can
not
endure
a
year
or
so
after
the
first
meeting
between
oscar
wilde
and
lord
alfred
douglas
i
heard
that
they
were
being
pestered
on
account
of
some
amorous
letters
which
had
been
stolen
from
them
there
was
talk
of
blackmail
and
hints
of
an
interesting
exposure
towards
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
announced
that
lord
alfred
douglas
had
gone
to
egypt
but
this
flight
into
egypt
as
it
was
wittily
called
was
gilded
by
the
fact
that
a
little
later
he
was
appointed
an
honorary
attache
to
lord
cromer
i
regarded
his
absence
as
a
piece
of
good
fortune
for
when
he
was
in
london
oscar
had
no
time
to
himself
and
was
seen
in
public
with
associates
he
would
have
done
better
to
avoid
time
and
again
he
had
praised
lord
alfred
douglas
to
me
as
a
charming
person
a
poet
and
had
grown
lyrical
about
his
violet
eyes
and
hair
i
knew
nothing
of
lord
alfred
douglas
and
had
no
inkling
of
his
poetic
talent
i
did
not
like
several
of
particular
friends
and
i
had
a
special
dislike
for
the
father
of
lord
alfred
douglas
i
knew
queensberry
rather
well
i
was
a
member
of
the
old
pelican
club
and
i
used
to
go
there
frequently
for
a
talk
with
tom
dick
or
harry
about
athletics
or
for
a
game
of
chess
with
george
edwards
queensberry
was
there
almost
every
night
and
someone
introduced
me
to
him
i
was
eager
to
know
him
because
he
had
surprised
me
at
some
play
the
promise
of
may
was
produced
in
november
i
think
it
was
the
promise
of
may
by
tennyson
produced
at
the
globe
in
which
atheists
were
condemned
he
had
got
up
in
his
box
and
denounced
the
play
proclaiming
himself
an
atheist
i
wanted
to
know
the
englishman
who
could
be
so
contemptuous
of
convention
had
he
acted
out
of
aristocratic
insolence
or
was
he
by
any
possibility
to
one
who
knew
the
man
the
mere
question
must
seem
ridiculous
queensberry
was
perhaps
five
feet
nine
or
ten
in
height
with
a
plain
heavy
rather
sullen
face
and
quick
hot
eyes
he
was
a
mass
of
all
bristling
with
suspicion
and
in
regard
to
money
prudent
to
meanness
he
cared
nothing
for
books
but
liked
outdoor
sports
and
under
a
rather
abrupt
but
not
discourteous
manner
hid
an
irritable
violent
temper
he
was
combative
and
courageous
as
very
nervous
people
sometimes
are
when
they
happen
to
be
the
sort
of
man
who
just
because
he
was
afraid
of
a
bull
and
had
pictured
the
dreadful
wound
it
could
give
would
therefore
seize
it
by
the
horns
the
insane
temper
of
the
man
got
him
into
rows
at
the
pelican
more
than
once
i
remember
one
evening
he
insulted
a
man
whom
i
liked
immensely
haseltine
was
a
stockbroker
i
think
a
big
fair
handsome
fellow
who
took
insults
for
some
time
with
cheerful
contempt
again
and
again
he
turned
queensberry
wrath
aside
with
a
fair
word
but
queensberry
went
on
working
himself
into
a
passion
and
at
last
made
a
rush
at
him
haseltine
watched
him
coming
and
hit
out
in
the
nick
of
time
he
caught
queensberry
full
in
the
face
and
literally
knocked
him
heels
over
head
queensberry
got
up
in
a
sad
mess
he
had
a
swollen
nose
and
black
eye
and
his
shirt
was
all
stained
with
blood
spread
about
by
hasty
wiping
any
other
man
would
have
continued
the
fight
or
else
have
left
the
club
on
the
spot
queensberry
took
a
seat
at
a
table
and
there
sat
for
hours
silent
i
could
only
explain
it
to
myself
by
saying
that
his
impulse
to
fly
at
once
from
the
scene
of
his
disgrace
was
very
acute
and
therefore
he
resisted
it
made
up
his
mind
not
to
budge
and
so
he
sat
there
the
butt
of
the
derisive
glances
and
whispered
talk
of
everyone
who
came
into
the
club
in
the
next
two
or
three
hours
he
was
just
the
sort
of
person
a
wise
man
would
avoid
and
a
clever
one
would
use
a
dangerous
sharp
tool
disliking
his
father
i
did
not
care
to
meet
lord
alfred
douglas
oscar
newest
friend
i
saw
oscar
less
frequently
after
the
success
of
his
first
play
he
no
longer
needed
my
editorial
services
and
was
besides
busily
engaged
but
i
have
one
good
trait
to
record
of
him
some
time
before
i
had
lent
him
so
long
as
he
was
hard
up
i
said
nothing
about
it
but
after
the
success
of
his
second
play
i
wrote
to
him
saying
that
the
would
be
useful
to
me
if
he
could
spare
it
he
sent
me
a
cheque
at
once
with
a
charming
letter
he
was
now
continually
about
again
with
lord
alfred
douglas
who
it
appeared
had
had
a
disagreement
with
lord
cromer
and
returned
to
london
almost
immediately
scandalous
stories
came
into
circulation
concerning
them
have
you
heard
the
latest
about
lord
alfred
and
oscar
i
told
they
being
watched
by
the
police
and
so
forth
and
so
on
interminably
one
day
a
story
came
to
me
with
such
wealth
of
weird
detail
that
it
was
manifestly
at
least
founded
on
fact
oscar
was
said
to
have
written
extraordinary
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
a
youth
called
alfred
wood
had
stolen
the
letters
from
lord
alfred
douglas
rooms
in
oxford
and
had
tried
to
blackmail
oscar
with
them
the
facts
were
so
peculiar
and
so
precise
that
i
asked
oscar
about
it
he
met
the
accusation
at
once
and
very
fairly
i
thought
and
told
me
the
whole
story
it
puts
the
triumphant
power
and
address
of
the
man
in
a
strong
light
and
so
i
will
tell
it
as
he
told
it
to
me
when
i
was
rehearsing
woman
of
no
importance
at
the
haymarket
he
began
beerbohm
tree
showed
me
a
letter
i
had
written
a
year
or
so
before
to
alfred
douglas
he
seemed
to
think
it
dangerous
but
i
laughed
at
him
and
read
the
letter
with
him
and
of
course
he
came
to
understand
it
properly
a
little
later
a
man
called
wood
told
me
he
had
found
some
letters
which
i
had
written
to
lord
alfred
douglas
in
a
suit
of
clothes
which
lord
alfred
had
given
to
him
he
gave
me
back
some
of
the
letters
and
i
gave
him
a
little
money
but
the
letter
a
copy
of
which
had
been
sent
to
beerbohm
tree
was
not
amongst
them
some
time
afterwards
a
man
named
allen
called
upon
me
one
night
in
tite
street
and
said
he
had
got
a
letter
of
mine
which
i
ought
to
have
the
man
manner
told
me
that
he
was
the
real
enemy
suppose
you
mean
that
beautiful
letter
of
mine
to
lord
alfred
douglas
i
said
you
had
not
been
so
foolish
as
to
send
a
copy
of
it
to
beerbohm
tree
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
paid
you
a
large
sum
for
it
as
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
ever
wrote
allen
looked
at
me
with
sulky
cunning
eyes
and
said
curious
construction
could
be
put
upon
that
letter
doubt
no
doubt
i
replied
lightly
is
not
intelligible
to
the
criminal
classes
he
looked
me
in
the
face
defiantly
and
said
man
has
offered
me
for
it
should
take
the
offer
i
said
gravely
is
a
great
price
i
myself
have
never
received
such
a
large
sum
for
any
prose
work
of
that
length
but
i
am
glad
to
find
that
there
is
someone
in
england
who
will
pay
such
a
large
sum
for
a
letter
of
mine
i
do
know
why
you
come
to
me
i
added
rising
should
sell
the
letter
at
once
of
course
frank
as
i
spoke
my
body
seemed
empty
with
fear
the
letter
could
be
misunderstood
and
i
have
so
many
envious
enemies
but
i
felt
that
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
but
bluff
as
i
went
to
the
door
allen
rose
too
and
said
that
the
man
who
had
offered
him
the
money
was
out
of
town
i
turned
to
him
and
said
will
no
doubt
return
and
i
do
care
for
the
letter
at
all
at
this
allen
changed
his
manner
said
he
was
very
poor
he
had
a
penny
in
the
world
and
had
spent
a
lot
trying
to
find
me
and
tell
me
about
the
letter
i
told
him
i
did
not
mind
relieving
his
distress
and
gave
him
half
a
sovereign
assuring
him
at
the
same
time
that
the
letter
would
shortly
be
published
as
a
sonnet
in
a
delightful
magazine
i
went
to
the
door
with
him
and
he
walked
away
i
closed
the
door
but
did
shut
it
at
once
for
suddenly
i
heard
a
policeman
step
coming
softly
towards
my
house
pad
pad
a
dreadful
moment
then
he
passed
by
i
went
into
the
room
again
all
shaken
wondering
whether
i
had
done
right
whether
allen
would
hawk
the
letter
about
a
thousand
vague
apprehensions
suddenly
a
knock
at
the
street
door
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
still
i
went
and
opened
it
a
man
named
cliburn
was
there
have
come
to
you
with
a
letter
of
allen
can
not
be
bothered
any
more
i
cried
that
letter
i
do
care
twopence
about
it
let
him
do
what
he
likes
with
it
to
my
astonishment
cliburn
said
has
asked
me
to
give
it
back
to
you
and
he
produced
it
does
he
give
it
back
to
me
i
asked
carelessly
says
you
were
kind
to
him
and
that
it
is
no
use
trying
to
rent
you
you
only
laugh
at
us
i
looked
at
the
letter
it
was
very
dirty
and
i
said
think
it
is
unpardonable
that
better
care
should
not
have
been
taken
of
a
manuscript
of
mine
he
said
he
was
sorry
but
it
had
been
in
many
hands
i
took
the
letter
up
casually
i
will
accept
the
letter
back
you
can
thank
allen
for
me
i
gave
cliburn
half
a
sovereign
for
his
trouble
and
said
to
him
am
afraid
you
are
leading
a
desperately
wicked
life
good
and
bad
in
every
one
of
us
he
replied
i
said
something
about
his
being
a
philosopher
and
he
went
away
that
the
whole
story
frank
but
the
letter
i
questioned
the
letter
is
nothing
oscar
replied
a
prose
poem
i
will
give
you
a
copy
of
it
here
is
the
letter
my
own
boy
your
sonnet
is
quite
lovely
and
it
is
a
marvel
that
those
red
lips
of
yours
should
be
made
no
less
for
the
madness
of
music
and
song
than
for
the
madness
of
kissing
your
soul
walks
between
passion
and
poetry
no
hyacinthus
followed
love
so
madly
as
you
in
greek
days
why
are
you
alone
in
london
and
when
do
you
go
to
salisbury
do
go
there
and
cool
your
hands
in
the
grey
twilight
of
gothic
things
come
here
whenever
you
like
it
is
a
lovely
place
and
only
lacks
you
do
go
to
salisbury
first
always
with
undying
love
yours
oscar
this
letter
startled
me
and
the
madness
of
kissing
were
calculated
to
give
one
pause
but
after
all
i
thought
it
may
be
merely
an
artist
letter
half
pose
half
passionate
admiration
another
thought
struck
me
but
how
did
such
a
letter
i
cried
ever
get
into
the
hands
of
a
blackmailer
i
do
know
he
replied
shrugging
his
shoulders
lord
alfred
douglas
is
very
careless
and
inconceivably
bold
you
should
know
him
frank
a
delightful
poet
but
how
did
he
come
to
know
a
creature
like
wood
i
persisted
how
can
i
tell
frank
he
answered
a
little
shortly
and
i
let
the
matter
drop
though
it
left
in
me
a
certain
doubt
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
the
scandal
grew
from
hour
to
hour
and
the
tide
of
hatred
rose
in
surges
one
day
i
was
lunching
at
the
savoy
and
while
talking
to
the
head
waiter
cesari
who
afterwards
managed
the
elysee
palace
hotel
in
paris
i
thought
i
saw
oscar
and
douglas
go
out
together
being
a
little
i
asked
is
that
oscar
wilde
yes
said
cesari
and
lord
alfred
douglas
we
wish
they
would
not
come
here
it
does
us
a
lot
of
harm
how
do
you
mean
i
asked
sharply
some
people
do
like
them
the
quick
italian
answered
immediately
oscar
wilde
i
remarked
casually
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
but
the
subtle
italian
was
already
warned
a
clever
writer
i
believe
he
said
smiling
in
bland
acquiescence
this
incident
gave
me
warning
strengthened
again
in
me
the
exact
apprehension
and
suspicion
which
the
douglas
letter
had
bred
oscar
i
knew
was
too
centred
went
about
too
continually
with
admirers
to
have
any
understanding
of
popular
feeling
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
realize
how
fiercely
hate
malice
and
envy
were
raging
against
him
i
wanted
to
warn
him
but
hardly
knew
how
to
do
it
effectively
and
without
offence
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
my
eyes
open
and
watch
an
opportunity
a
little
later
i
gave
a
dinner
at
the
savoy
and
asked
him
to
come
he
was
delightful
his
vivacious
gaiety
as
exhilarating
as
wine
but
he
was
more
like
a
roman
emperor
than
ever
he
had
grown
fat
he
ate
and
drank
too
much
not
that
he
was
intoxicated
but
he
became
flushed
and
in
spite
of
his
gay
and
genial
talk
he
affected
me
a
little
unpleasantly
he
was
gross
and
puffed
up
but
he
gave
one
or
two
splendid
snapshots
of
actors
and
their
egregious
vanity
it
seemed
to
him
a
great
pity
that
actors
should
be
taught
to
read
and
write
they
should
learn
their
pieces
from
the
lips
of
the
poet
just
as
work
is
the
curse
of
the
drinking
classes
of
this
country
he
said
laughing
so
education
is
the
curse
of
the
acting
classes
yet
even
when
making
fun
of
the
mummers
there
was
a
new
tone
in
him
of
arrogance
and
disdain
he
used
always
to
be
genial
and
kindly
even
to
those
he
laughed
at
now
he
was
openly
contemptuous
the
truth
is
that
his
extraordinarily
receptive
mind
went
with
an
even
more
abnormal
receptivity
of
character
unlike
most
men
of
marked
ability
he
took
colour
from
his
associates
in
this
as
in
love
of
courtesies
and
dislike
of
coarse
words
he
was
curiously
feminine
intercourse
with
beardsley
for
example
had
backed
his
humorous
gentleness
with
a
sort
of
challenging
courage
his
new
intimacy
with
lord
alfred
douglas
coming
on
the
top
of
his
triumph
as
a
playwright
was
lending
him
aggressive
confidence
there
was
in
him
that
hubris
insolent
which
the
greek
feared
the
pride
which
goeth
before
destruction
i
regretted
the
change
in
him
and
was
nervously
apprehensive
after
dinner
we
all
went
out
by
the
door
which
gives
on
the
embankment
for
it
was
after
one
of
the
party
proposed
that
we
should
walk
for
a
minute
or
two
at
least
as
far
as
the
strand
before
driving
home
oscar
objected
he
hated
walking
it
was
a
form
of
penal
servitude
to
the
animal
in
man
he
declared
but
he
consented
nevertheless
under
protest
laughing
when
we
were
going
up
the
steps
to
the
strand
he
again
objected
and
quoted
famous
lines
tu
proverai
si
come
sa
di
sale
lo
pane
altrui
e
com
e
duro
calle
lo
scendere
e
salir
per
scale
the
impression
made
by
oscar
that
evening
was
not
only
of
but
of
i
could
not
imagine
what
had
given
him
this
insolent
complacence
i
wanted
to
get
by
myself
and
think
prosperity
was
certainly
doing
him
no
good
all
the
while
the
opposition
to
him
i
felt
was
growing
in
force
how
could
i
verify
this
impression
i
asked
myself
so
as
to
warn
him
effectually
i
decided
to
give
a
lunch
to
him
and
on
purpose
i
put
on
the
invitations
to
meet
oscar
wilde
and
hear
a
new
story
out
of
a
dozen
invitations
sent
out
to
men
seven
or
eight
were
refused
three
or
four
telling
me
in
all
kindness
that
they
would
rather
not
meet
oscar
wilde
this
confirmed
my
worst
fears
when
englishmen
speak
out
in
this
way
the
dislike
must
be
near
revolt
i
gave
the
lunch
and
saw
plainly
enough
that
my
forebodings
were
justified
oscar
was
more
than
ever
but
his
talk
did
not
suffer
indeed
it
seemed
to
improve
at
this
lunch
he
told
the
charming
fable
of
narcissus
which
is
certainly
one
of
his
most
characteristic
short
stories
when
narcissus
died
the
flowers
of
the
field
were
plunged
in
grief
and
asked
the
river
for
drops
of
water
that
they
might
mourn
for
him
replied
the
river
only
my
drops
of
water
were
tears
i
should
not
have
enough
to
weep
for
narcissus
myself
i
loved
him
could
you
help
loving
narcissus
said
the
flowers
beautiful
was
he
he
beautiful
asked
the
river
should
know
that
better
than
you
said
the
flowers
every
day
lying
on
your
bank
he
would
mirror
his
beauty
in
your
waters
oscar
paused
here
and
then
went
on
i
loved
him
replied
the
river
is
because
when
he
hung
over
me
i
saw
the
reflection
of
my
own
loveliness
in
his
eyes
after
lunch
i
took
him
aside
and
tried
to
warn
him
told
him
that
unpleasant
stories
were
being
put
about
against
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
me
all
envy
frank
and
malice
what
do
i
care
i
go
to
clumber
this
summer
besides
i
am
doing
another
play
which
i
rather
like
i
always
knew
that
writing
was
my
province
as
a
youth
i
tried
to
write
plays
in
verse
that
was
my
mistake
now
i
know
better
i
sure
of
myself
and
of
success
somehow
or
other
in
spite
of
his
apparent
assurance
i
felt
he
was
in
danger
and
i
doubted
his
quality
as
a
fighter
but
after
all
it
was
not
my
business
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
it
seems
to
me
now
that
my
mistrust
dated
from
the
second
paper
war
with
whistler
wherein
to
the
astonishment
of
everyone
oscar
did
not
come
off
victorious
as
soon
as
he
met
with
opposition
his
power
of
repartee
seemed
to
desert
him
and
whistler
using
mere
rudeness
and
sharpness
held
the
field
oscar
was
evidently
not
a
born
fighter
i
asked
him
once
how
it
was
he
let
whistler
off
so
lightly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
showed
some
irritation
what
could
i
say
frank
why
should
i
belabour
the
beaten
the
man
is
a
wasp
and
delights
in
using
his
sting
i
have
done
more
perhaps
than
anyone
to
make
him
famous
i
had
no
wish
to
hurt
him
was
it
magnanimity
or
weakness
or
as
i
think
a
constitutional
a
feminine
shrinking
from
struggle
and
strife
whatever
the
cause
it
was
clear
that
oscar
was
what
shakespeare
called
himself
an
unhurtful
opposite
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
he
had
been
attacked
face
to
face
oscar
would
have
given
a
better
account
of
himself
at
grenfell
now
lady
desborough
he
crossed
swords
once
with
the
prime
minister
and
came
off
victorious
asquith
began
by
bantering
him
in
appearance
lightly
in
reality
seriously
for
putting
many
of
his
sentences
in
italics
the
man
who
uses
italics
said
the
politician
is
like
the
man
who
raises
his
voice
in
conversation
and
talks
loudly
in
order
to
make
himself
heard
it
was
the
objection
which
emerson
had
taken
to
carlyle
overwrought
style
pointed
probably
by
dislike
of
the
way
oscar
monopolised
conversation
oscar
met
the
stereotyped
attack
with
smiling
how
delightful
of
you
asquith
to
have
noticed
that
the
brilliant
phrase
like
good
wine
needs
no
bush
but
just
as
the
orator
marks
his
good
things
by
a
dramatic
pause
or
by
raising
or
lowering
his
voice
or
by
gesture
so
the
writer
marks
his
epigrams
with
italics
setting
the
little
gem
so
to
speak
like
a
jeweller
an
excusable
love
of
one
art
not
all
mere
vanity
i
like
to
think
all
this
with
the
most
pleasant
smile
and
manner
in
measure
as
i
distrusted
oscar
fighting
power
and
admired
his
sweetness
of
nature
i
took
sides
with
him
and
wanted
to
help
him
one
day
i
heard
some
talk
at
the
pelican
club
which
filled
me
with
fear
for
him
and
quickened
my
resolve
to
put
him
on
his
guard
i
was
going
in
just
as
queensberry
was
coming
out
with
two
or
three
of
his
special
cronies
i
do
it
i
heard
him
cry
i
teach
the
fellow
to
leave
my
son
alone
i
not
have
their
names
coupled
together
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
combative
face
and
the
hot
grey
eyes
what
it
all
about
i
asked
only
queensberry
said
someone
swearing
he
stop
oscar
wilde
going
about
with
that
son
of
his
alfred
douglas
suddenly
my
fears
took
form
as
in
a
flash
i
saw
oscar
heedless
and
smiling
walking
along
with
his
head
in
the
air
and
that
violent
combative
insane
creature
pouncing
on
him
i
sat
down
at
once
and
wrote
begging
oscar
to
lunch
with
me
the
next
day
alone
as
i
had
something
important
to
say
to
him
he
turned
up
in
park
lane
manifestly
anxious
a
little
frightened
i
think
what
is
it
frank
i
told
him
very
seriously
what
i
had
heard
and
gave
besides
my
impression
of
queensberry
character
and
his
insane
pugnacity
what
can
i
do
frank
said
oscar
showing
distress
and
apprehension
all
bosie
who
is
bosie
i
asked
that
is
lord
alfred
douglas
pet
name
it
all
bosie
fault
he
has
quarrelled
with
his
father
or
rather
his
father
has
quarrelled
with
him
he
quarrels
with
everyone
with
lady
queensberry
with
percy
douglas
with
bosie
everyone
he
impossible
what
can
i
do
avoid
him
i
said
do
go
about
with
lord
alfred
douglas
give
queensberry
his
triumph
you
could
make
a
friend
of
him
as
easily
as
possible
if
you
wished
write
him
a
conciliatory
letter
but
he
want
me
to
drop
bosie
and
stop
seeing
lady
queensberry
and
i
like
them
all
they
are
charming
to
me
why
should
i
cringe
to
this
madman
because
he
is
a
madman
oh
frank
i
ca
he
cried
bosie
would
let
me
let
you
i
repeated
angrily
how
absurd
that
queensberry
man
will
go
to
violence
to
any
extremity
do
you
fight
other
people
quarrels
you
may
have
enough
of
your
own
some
day
you
not
sympathetic
frank
he
chided
weakly
i
know
you
mean
it
kindly
but
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
as
you
advise
i
can
not
give
up
my
friend
i
really
can
not
let
lord
queensberry
choose
my
friends
for
me
it
too
absurd
but
it
wise
i
replied
there
a
very
bad
verse
in
one
of
hugo
plays
it
always
amused
me
he
likens
poverty
to
a
low
door
and
declares
that
when
we
have
to
pass
through
it
the
man
who
stoops
lowest
is
the
wisest
so
when
you
meet
a
madman
the
wisest
thing
to
do
is
to
avoid
him
and
not
quarrel
with
him
it
very
hard
frank
of
course
i
think
over
what
you
say
but
really
queensberry
ought
to
be
in
a
madhouse
he
too
absurd
and
in
that
spirit
he
left
me
outwardly
he
might
have
remembered
chaucer
words
beware
also
to
spurne
again
a
nall
strive
not
as
doeth
a

chapter
xii
danger
signals
the
challenge
these
two
years
saw
oscar
wilde
at
the
very
zenith
of
success
thackeray
who
always
felt
himself
a
monetary
failure
in
comparison
with
dickens
calls
success
one
of
the
greatest
of
a
great
man
qualities
and
oscar
was
not
successful
merely
he
was
triumphant
not
sheridan
the
day
after
his
marriage
not
byron
when
he
awoke
to
find
himself
famous
ever
reached
such
a
pinnacle
his
plays
were
bringing
in
so
much
that
he
could
spend
money
like
water
he
had
won
every
sort
of
popularity
the
gross
applause
of
the
many
and
the
finer
incense
of
the
few
who
constitute
the
jury
of
fame
his
personal
popularity
too
was
extraordinary
thousands
admired
him
many
liked
him
he
seemed
to
have
everything
that
heart
could
desire
and
perfect
health
to
boot
even
his
home
life
was
without
a
cloud
two
stories
which
he
told
at
this
time
paint
him
one
was
about
his
two
boys
vyvyan
and
cyril
children
are
sometimes
interesting
he
began
the
other
night
i
was
reading
when
my
wife
came
and
asked
me
to
go
upstairs
and
reprove
the
elder
boy
cyril
it
appeared
would
not
say
his
prayers
he
had
quarrelled
with
vyvyan
and
beaten
him
and
when
he
was
shaken
and
told
he
must
say
his
prayers
he
would
not
kneel
down
or
ask
god
to
make
him
a
good
boy
of
course
i
had
to
go
upstairs
and
see
to
it
i
took
the
chubby
little
fellow
on
my
knee
and
told
him
in
a
grave
way
that
he
had
been
very
naughty
naughty
to
hit
his
younger
brother
and
naughty
because
he
had
given
his
mother
pain
he
must
kneel
down
at
once
and
ask
god
to
forgive
him
and
make
him
a
good
boy
was
not
naughty
he
pouted
was
vyvyan
he
was
naughty
i
explained
to
him
that
his
temper
was
naughty
and
that
he
must
do
as
he
was
told
with
a
little
sigh
he
slipped
off
my
knee
and
knelt
down
and
put
his
little
hands
together
as
he
had
been
taught
and
began
father
when
he
had
finished
the
prayer
he
looked
up
at
me
and
said
gravely
pray
to
myself
he
closed
his
eyes
and
his
lips
moved
when
he
had
finished
i
took
him
in
my
arms
again
and
kissed
him
that
right
i
said
said
you
were
sorry
questioned
his
mother
leaning
over
him
asked
god
to
make
you
a
good
boy
mother
he
nodded
said
i
was
sorry
and
asked
god
to
make
vyvyan
a
good
boy
i
had
to
leave
the
room
frank
or
he
would
have
seen
me
smiling
was
it
delightful
of
him
we
are
all
willing
to
ask
god
to
make
others
good
this
story
shows
the
lovable
side
of
him
there
was
another
side
not
so
amiable
in
april
a
woman
of
no
importance
was
produced
by
herbert
beerbohm
tree
at
the
haymarket
and
ran
till
the
end
of
the
season
august
surviving
even
the
festival
of
grouse
the
astonishing
success
of
this
second
play
confirmed
oscar
wilde
popularity
gave
him
money
to
spend
and
increased
his
in
the
summer
he
took
a
house
up
the
river
at
goring
and
went
there
to
live
with
lord
alfred
douglas
weird
stories
came
to
us
in
london
about
their
life
together
some
time
in
september
i
think
it
was
i
asked
him
what
was
the
truth
underlying
these
reports
scandals
and
slanders
frank
have
no
relation
to
truth
he
replied
i
wonder
if
that
true
i
said
slander
often
has
some
substratum
of
truth
it
resembles
the
truth
like
a
gigantic
shadow
there
is
a
likeness
at
least
in
outline
that
would
be
true
he
retorted
if
the
canvas
so
to
speak
on
which
the
shadows
fall
were
even
and
true
but
it
is
not
scandals
and
slander
are
related
to
the
hatred
of
the
people
who
invent
them
and
are
not
in
any
shadowy
sense
even
effigies
or
images
of
the
person
attacked
much
smoke
then
i
queried
and
no
fire
only
little
fires
he
rejoined
show
much
smoke
the
foundation
for
what
you
heard
is
both
small
and
harmless
the
summer
was
very
warm
and
beautiful
as
you
know
and
i
was
up
at
goring
with
bosie
often
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
were
too
hot
to
go
on
the
river
one
afternoon
it
was
and
bosie
proposed
that
i
should
turn
the
hose
pipe
on
him
he
went
in
and
threw
his
things
off
and
so
did
i
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
seated
in
a
chair
with
a
bath
towel
round
me
and
bosie
was
lying
on
the
grass
about
ten
yards
away
when
the
vicar
came
to
pay
us
a
call
the
servant
told
him
that
we
were
in
the
garden
and
he
came
and
found
us
there
frank
you
have
no
idea
the
sort
of
face
he
pulled
what
could
i
say
am
the
vicar
of
the
parish
he
bowed
pompously
delighted
to
see
you
i
said
getting
up
and
draping
myself
carefully
have
come
just
in
time
to
enjoy
a
perfectly
greek
scene
i
regret
that
i
am
scarcely
fit
to
receive
you
and
bosie
there
and
i
pointed
to
bosie
lying
on
the
grass
the
vicar
turned
his
head
and
saw
bosie
white
limbs
the
sight
was
too
much
for
him
he
got
very
red
gave
a
gasp
and
fled
from
the
place
i
simply
sat
down
in
my
chair
and
shrieked
with
laughter
how
he
may
have
described
the
scene
what
explanation
he
gave
of
it
what
vile
gloss
he
may
have
invented
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
i
have
no
doubt
he
wagged
his
head
and
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
unutterable
things
but
really
it
takes
a
saint
to
suffer
such
fools
gladly
i
could
not
help
smiling
when
i
thought
of
the
vicar
face
but
oscar
tone
was
not
pleasant
the
change
in
him
had
gone
further
than
i
had
feared
he
was
now
utterly
contemptuous
of
criticism
and
would
listen
to
no
counsel
he
was
gross
too
the
rich
food
and
wine
seemed
to
ooze
out
of
him
and
his
manner
was
defiant
hard
he
was
like
some
great
pagan
determined
to
live
his
own
life
to
the
very
fullest
careless
of
what
others
might
say
or
think
or
do
even
the
stories
which
he
wrote
about
this
time
show
the
worst
side
of
his
paganism
when
jesus
was
minded
to
return
to
nazareth
nazareth
was
so
changed
that
he
no
longer
recognised
his
own
city
the
nazareth
where
he
had
lived
was
full
of
lamentations
and
tears
this
city
was
filled
with
outbursts
of
laughter
and
song
christ
went
out
of
the
house
and
behold
in
the
street
he
saw
a
woman
whose
face
and
raiment
were
painted
and
whose
feet
were
shod
with
pearls
and
behind
her
walked
a
man
who
wore
a
cloak
of
two
colours
and
whose
eyes
were
bright
with
lust
and
christ
went
up
to
the
man
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
to
him
me
why
art
thou
following
this
woman
and
why
dost
thou
look
at
her
in
such
wise
the
man
turned
round
recognised
him
and
said
was
blind
thou
didst
heal
me
what
else
should
i
do
with
my
sight
the
same
note
is
played
on
in
two
or
three
more
incidents
but
the
one
i
have
given
is
the
best
and
should
have
been
allowed
to
stand
alone
it
has
been
called
blasphemous
it
is
not
intentionally
blasphemous
as
i
have
said
oscar
always
put
himself
quite
naively
in
the
place
of
any
historical
character
the
disdain
of
public
opinion
which
oscar
now
showed
not
only
in
his
writings
but
in
his
answers
to
criticism
quickly
turned
the
public
dislike
into
aggressive
hatred
in
a
book
appeared
the
green
carnation
which
was
a
sort
of
photograph
of
oscar
as
a
talker
and
a
caricature
of
his
thought
the
gossipy
story
had
a
surprising
success
altogether
beyond
its
merits
which
simply
testified
to
the
intense
interest
the
suspicion
of
extraordinary
viciousness
has
for
common
minds
oscar
genius
was
not
given
in
the
book
at
all
but
his
humour
was
indicated
and
a
malevolent
doubt
of
his
morality
insisted
upon
again
and
again
rumour
had
it
that
the
book
was
true
in
every
particular
that
hichens
had
taken
down
oscar
talks
evening
after
evening
and
simply
reproduced
them
i
asked
oscar
if
this
was
true
true
enough
frank
he
replied
with
a
certain
contempt
which
was
foreign
to
him
hichens
got
to
know
bosie
douglas
in
egypt
they
went
up
the
nile
together
i
believe
with
denson
naturally
bosie
talked
a
great
deal
about
me
and
hichens
wanted
to
know
me
when
they
returned
to
town
i
thought
him
rather
pleasant
and
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
going
to
play
reporter
it
seems
to
me
a
breach
of
confidence
ignoble
it
is
not
a
picture
of
you
i
said
but
there
is
a
certain
likeness
a
photograph
is
always
like
and
unlike
frank
he
replied
the
sun
too
when
used
mechanically
is
merely
a
reporter
and
traduces
instead
of
reproducing
you
the
green
carnation
ruined
oscar
wilde
character
with
the
general
public
on
all
sides
the
book
was
referred
to
as
confirming
the
worst
suspicions
the
cloud
which
hung
over
him
grew
continually
darker
during
the
summer
of
he
wrote
the
ideal
husband
which
was
the
outcome
of
a
story
i
had
told
him
i
had
heard
it
from
an
american
i
had
met
in
cairo
a
mr
cope
whitehouse
he
told
me
that
disraeli
had
made
money
by
entrusting
the
rothschilds
with
the
purchase
of
the
suez
canal
shares
it
seemed
to
me
strange
that
this
statement
if
true
had
never
been
set
forth
authoritatively
but
the
story
was
peculiarly
modern
and
had
possibilities
in
it
oscar
admitted
afterwards
that
he
had
taken
the
idea
and
used
it
in
an
ideal
husband
it
was
in
this
summer
also
that
he
wrote
the
importance
of
being
earnest
his
finest
play
he
went
to
the
seaside
and
completed
it
he
said
in
three
weeks
and
when
i
spoke
of
the
delight
he
must
feel
at
having
two
plays
performed
in
london
at
the
same
time
he
said
next
year
frank
i
may
have
four
or
five
i
could
write
one
every
two
months
with
the
greatest
ease
it
all
depends
on
money
if
i
need
money
i
shall
write
half
a
dozen
plays
next
year
his
words
reminded
me
of
what
goethe
had
said
about
himself
in
each
of
the
ten
years
he
spent
on
his
theory
of
light
he
could
have
written
a
couple
of
plays
as
good
as
his
best
the
land
of
is
peopled
with
these
gorgeous
oscar
had
already
found
his
public
a
public
capable
of
appreciating
the
very
best
he
could
do
as
soon
as
the
importance
of
being
earnest
was
produced
it
had
an
extraordinary
success
and
success
of
the
best
sort
even
journalist
critics
had
begun
to
cease
exhibiting
their
own
limitations
in
foolish
finding
and
now
imitated
their
betters
parroting
phrases
of
extravagant
laudation
oscar
took
the
praise
as
he
had
taken
the
scandal
and
slander
with
complacent
superiority
he
had
changed
greatly
and
for
the
worse
he
was
growing
coarser
and
harder
every
year
all
his
friends
noticed
this
even
andre
gide
who
was
a
great
admirer
and
wrote
shortly
after
his
death
the
best
account
of
him
that
appeared
was
compelled
to
deplore
his
deterioration
he
says
one
felt
that
there
was
less
tenderness
in
his
looks
that
there
was
something
harsh
in
his
laughter
and
a
wild
madness
in
his
joy
he
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
be
sure
of
pleasing
and
less
ambitious
to
succeed
therein
he
had
grown
reckless
hardened
and
conceited
strangely
enough
he
no
longer
spoke
in
fables
his
brother
willie
made
a
similar
complaint
to
sir
edward
sullivan
sir
edward
writes
william
wilde
told
me
when
oscar
was
in
prison
that
the
only
trouble
between
him
and
his
brother
was
caused
by
oscar
inordinate
vanity
in
the
period
before
his
conviction
had
surrounded
himself
william
said
a
gang
of
parasites
who
praised
him
all
day
long
and
to
whom
he
used
to
give
his
breast
pins
in
return
for
their
sickening
flattery
no
one
not
even
i
his
brother
dared
offer
any
criticism
on
his
works
without
offending
him
if
proof
were
needed
both
of
his
reckless
contempt
for
public
opinion
and
the
malignancy
with
which
he
was
misjudged
it
could
be
found
in
an
incident
which
took
place
towards
the
end
of
a
journal
entitled
the
chameleon
was
produced
by
some
oxford
undergraduates
oscar
wrote
for
it
a
handful
of
sayings
which
he
called
phrases
and
philosophies
for
the
use
of
the
young
his
epigrams
were
harmless
enough
but
in
the
same
number
there
appeared
a
story
entitled
the
priest
and
the
acolyte
which
could
hardly
be
defended
the
mere
fact
that
his
work
was
printed
in
the
same
journal
called
forth
a
storm
of
condemnation
though
he
had
never
seen
the
story
before
it
was
published
nor
had
he
anything
to
do
with
its
insertion
nemesis
was
following
hard
after
him
late
in
this
year
he
spoke
to
me
of
his
own
accord
about
lord
queensberry
he
wanted
my
advice
lord
queensberry
is
annoying
me
he
said
i
did
my
best
to
reconcile
him
and
bosie
one
day
at
the
cafe
royal
while
bosie
and
i
were
lunching
there
queensberry
came
in
and
i
made
bosie
go
over
and
fetch
his
father
and
bring
him
to
lunch
with
us
he
was
half
friendly
with
me
till
quite
recently
though
he
wrote
a
shameful
letter
to
bosie
about
us
what
am
i
to
do
i
asked
him
what
lord
queensberry
objected
to
he
objects
to
my
friendship
with
bosie
then
why
not
cease
to
see
bosie
i
asked
it
is
impossible
frank
and
ridiculous
why
should
i
give
up
my
friends
for
queensberry
i
should
like
to
see
queensberry
letter
i
said
is
it
possible
i
bring
it
to
you
frank
but
there
nothing
in
it
a
day
or
two
later
he
showed
me
the
letter
and
after
i
had
read
it
he
produced
a
copy
of
the
telegram
which
lord
alfred
douglas
had
sent
to
his
father
in
reply
here
they
both
are
they
speak
for
themselves
loudly
enough
alfred
it
is
extremely
painful
for
me
to
have
to
write
to
you
in
the
strain
i
must
but
please
understand
that
i
decline
to
receive
any
answers
from
you
in
writing
in
return
after
your
recent
hysterical
impertinent
ones
i
refuse
to
be
annoyed
with
such
and
i
decline
to
read
any
more
letters
if
you
have
anything
to
say
do
come
here
and
say
it
in
person
firstly
am
i
to
understand
that
having
left
oxford
as
you
did
with
discredit
to
yourself
the
reasons
of
which
were
fully
explained
to
me
by
your
tutor
you
now
intend
to
loaf
and
loll
about
and
do
nothing
all
the
time
you
were
wasting
at
oxford
i
was
put
off
with
an
assurance
that
you
were
eventually
to
go
into
the
civil
service
or
to
the
foreign
office
and
then
i
was
put
off
with
an
assurance
that
you
were
going
to
the
bar
it
appears
to
me
that
you
intend
to
do
nothing
i
utterly
decline
however
to
just
supply
you
with
sufficient
funds
to
enable
you
to
loaf
about
you
are
preparing
a
wretched
future
for
yourself
and
it
would
be
most
cruel
and
wrong
for
me
to
encourage
you
in
this
secondly
i
come
to
the
more
painful
part
of
this
letter
your
intimacy
with
this
man
wilde
it
must
either
cease
or
i
will
disown
you
and
stop
all
money
supplies
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
analyse
this
intimacy
and
i
make
no
charge
but
to
my
mind
to
pose
as
a
thing
is
as
bad
as
to
be
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
you
both
in
the
most
loathsome
and
disgusting
relationship
as
expressed
by
your
manner
and
expression
never
in
my
experience
have
i
ever
seen
such
a
sight
as
that
in
your
horrible
features
no
wonder
people
are
talking
as
they
are
also
i
now
hear
on
good
authority
but
this
may
be
false
that
his
wife
is
petitioning
to
divorce
him
for
sodomy
and
other
crimes
is
this
true
or
do
you
not
know
of
it
if
i
thought
the
actual
thing
was
true
and
it
became
public
property
i
should
be
quite
justified
in
shooting
him
at
sight
these
christian
english
cowards
and
men
as
they
call
themselves
want
waking
up
your
disgusted
father
queensberry
in
reply
to
this
letter
lord
alfred
douglas
telegraphed
what
a
funny
little
man
you
are
alfred
douglas
this
telegram
was
excellently
calculated
to
drive
queensberry
frantic
with
rage
there
was
feminine
cunning
in
its
wound
to
vanity
a
little
later
oscar
told
me
that
queensberry
accompanied
by
a
friend
had
called
on
him
what
happened
i
asked
i
said
to
him
suppose
lord
queensberry
you
have
come
to
apologise
for
the
libellous
letter
you
wrote
about
me
he
replied
letter
was
privileged
it
was
written
to
my
son
dared
you
say
such
a
thing
about
your
son
and
me
were
both
kicked
out
of
the
savoy
hotel
for
disgusting
conduct
he
replied
untrue
i
said
untrue
were
blackmailed
too
for
a
disgusting
letter
you
wrote
my
son
he
went
on
do
know
who
has
been
telling
you
all
these
silly
stories
i
replied
they
are
untrue
and
quite
ridiculous
he
ended
up
by
saying
that
if
he
caught
me
and
his
son
together
again
he
would
thrash
me
do
know
what
the
queensberry
rules
are
i
retorted
my
rule
is
to
shoot
at
sight
in
case
of
personal
violence
and
with
that
i
told
him
to
leave
my
house
of
course
he
defied
you
i
questioned
he
was
rude
frank
and
preposterous
to
the
end
as
oscar
was
telling
me
the
story
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
another
person
were
speaking
through
his
mouth
the
idea
of
oscar
standing
up
to
queensberry
or
shooting
at
sight
was
too
absurd
who
was
inspiring
him
alfred
douglas
what
has
happened
since
i
enquired
nothing
he
replied
perhaps
he
will
be
quiet
now
bosie
has
written
him
a
terrible
letter
he
must
see
now
that
if
he
goes
on
he
will
only
injure
his
own
flesh
and
blood
that
wo
stop
him
i
replied
if
i
read
him
aright
but
if
i
could
see
what
alfred
douglas
wrote
i
should
be
better
able
to
judge
of
the
effect
it
will
have
on
queensberry
a
little
later
i
saw
the
letter
it
shows
better
than
words
of
mine
the
tempers
of
the
chief
actors
in
this
squalid
story
as
you
return
my
letters
unopened
i
am
obliged
to
write
on
a
postcard
i
write
to
inform
you
that
i
treat
your
absurd
threats
with
absolute
indifference
ever
since
your
exhibition
at
house
i
have
made
a
point
of
appearing
with
him
at
many
public
restaurants
such
as
the
berkeley
willis
rooms
the
cafe
royal
and
i
shall
continue
to
go
to
any
of
these
places
whenever
i
choose
and
with
whom
i
choose
i
am
of
age
and
my
own
master
you
have
disowned
me
at
least
a
dozen
times
and
have
very
meanly
deprived
me
of
money
you
have
therefore
no
right
over
me
either
legal
or
moral
if
was
to
prosecute
you
in
the
central
criminal
court
for
libel
you
would
get
seven
years
penal
servitude
for
your
outrageous
libels
much
as
i
detest
you
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
this
for
the
sake
of
the
family
but
if
you
try
to
assault
me
i
shall
defend
myself
with
a
loaded
revolver
which
i
always
carry
and
if
i
shoot
you
or
if
he
shoots
you
we
shall
be
completely
justified
as
we
shall
be
acting
in
against
a
violent
and
dangerous
rough
and
i
think
if
you
were
dead
many
people
would
not
miss
a
this
letter
of
the
son
seemed
to
me
appalling
my
guess
was
right
it
was
he
who
was
speaking
through
oscar
the
threat
of
shooting
at
sight
came
from
him
i
did
not
then
understand
all
the
circumstances
i
had
not
met
lady
queensberry
i
could
not
have
imagined
how
she
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
her
husband
a
charming
cultivated
woman
with
exquisite
taste
in
literature
and
art
a
woman
of
the
most
delicate
sensibilities
and
noble
generosities
coupled
with
that
violent
coarse
animal
with
the
hot
eyes
and
combative
nature
her
married
life
had
been
a
martyrdom
naturally
the
children
had
all
taken
her
side
in
the
quarrel
and
lord
alfred
douglas
her
especial
favourite
had
practically
identified
himself
with
her
which
explains
to
some
extent
though
nothing
can
justify
the
unnatural
animosity
of
his
letter
the
letter
showed
me
that
the
quarrel
was
far
deeper
far
bitterer
than
i
had
imagined
one
of
those
dreadful
family
quarrels
where
the
intimate
knowledge
each
has
of
the
other
whips
anger
to
madness
all
i
could
do
was
to
warn
oscar
it
the
old
old
story
i
said
you
are
putting
your
hand
between
the
bark
and
the
tree
and
you
will
suffer
for
it
but
he
would
not
or
could
not
see
it
what
is
one
to
do
with
such
a
madman
he
asked
pitiably
avoid
him
i
replied
as
you
would
avoid
a
madman
who
wanted
to
fight
with
you
or
conciliate
him
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
he
would
not
be
warned
a
little
later
the
matter
came
up
again
at
the
first
production
of
the
importance
of
being
earnest
lord
queensberry
appeared
at
the
theatre
carrying
a
large
bouquet
of
turnips
and
carrots
what
the
meaning
was
of
those
vegetables
only
the
man
himself
and
his
like
could
divine
i
asked
oscar
about
the
matter
he
seemed
annoyed
but
on
the
whole
triumphant
queensberry
he
said
had
engaged
a
stall
at
the
james
theatre
no
doubt
to
kick
up
a
row
but
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
it
i
got
alick
george
alexander
to
send
him
back
his
money
on
the
night
of
the
first
performance
queensberry
appeared
carrying
a
large
bundle
of
carrots
he
was
refused
admittance
at
the
and
when
he
tried
to
enter
the
gallery
the
police
would
not
let
him
in
he
must
be
mad
frank
do
you
think
i
am
glad
he
was
foiled
he
is
insanely
violent
i
said
he
will
keep
on
attacking
you
but
what
can
i
do
frank
do
ask
for
advice
you
wo
take
i
replied
there
a
french
proverb
i
always
liked
love
and
war
do
seek
counsel
but
for
god
sake
do
drift
stop
while
you
can
but
oscar
would
have
had
to
take
a
resolution
and
act
in
order
to
stop
and
he
was
incapable
of
such
energy
the
wild
horses
of
fate
had
run
away
with
the
light
chariot
of
his
fortune
and
what
the
end
would
be
no
one
could
foresee
it
came
with
appalling
suddenness
one
evening
in
february
i
heard
that
the
marquis
of
queensberry
had
left
an
insulting
card
for
oscar
at
the
albemarle
club
my
informant
added
gleefully
that
now
oscar
would
have
to
face
the
music
and
we
all
see
what
was
in
him
there
was
no
malice
in
this
just
an
englishman
pleasure
in
a
desperate
fight
and
curiosity
as
to
the
issue
a
little
later
i
received
a
letter
from
oscar
asking
me
if
he
could
call
on
me
that
afternoon
i
stayed
in
and
about
four
he
came
to
see
me
at
first
he
used
the
old
imperious
mask
which
he
had
lately
accustomed
himself
to
wear
i
am
bringing
an
action
against
queensberry
frank
he
began
gravely
for
criminal
libel
he
is
a
mere
wild
beast
my
solicitors
tell
me
that
i
am
certain
to
win
but
they
say
some
of
the
things
i
have
written
will
be
brought
up
against
me
in
court
now
you
know
all
i
have
written
would
you
in
your
position
as
editor
of
the
fortnightly
come
and
give
evidence
for
me
testify
for
instance
that
gray
is
not
immoral
yes
i
replied
at
once
i
should
be
perfectly
willing
and
i
could
say
more
than
that
i
could
say
that
you
are
one
of
the
very
few
men
i
have
ever
known
whose
talk
and
whose
writings
were
vowed
away
from
grossness
of
any
sort
oh
frank
would
you
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
he
cried
out
my
solicitors
said
i
ought
to
ask
you
but
they
were
afraid
you
would
not
like
to
come
your
evidence
will
win
the
case
it
is
good
of
you
his
whole
face
was
shaken
he
turned
away
to
hide
the
tears
anything
i
can
do
oscar
i
said
i
shall
do
with
pleasure
and
as
you
know
to
the
uttermost
but
i
want
you
to
consider
the
matter
carefully
an
english
court
of
law
gives
me
no
assurance
of
a
fair
trial
or
rather
i
am
certain
that
in
matters
of
art
or
morality
an
english
court
is
about
the
worst
tribunal
in
the
civilised
world
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
i
can
not
help
it
i
can
not
alter
it
he
said
you
must
listen
to
me
i
insisted
you
remember
the
whistler
and
ruskin
action
you
know
that
whistler
ought
to
have
won
you
know
that
ruskin
was
shamelessly
in
fault
but
the
british
jury
and
the
british
artists
treated
whistler
and
his
superb
work
with
contempt
take
a
different
case
altogether
the
belt
case
where
all
the
academicians
went
into
the
witness
box
and
asserted
honestly
enough
that
belt
was
an
impostor
yet
the
jury
gave
him
a
verdict
of
though
a
year
later
he
was
sent
to
penal
servitude
for
the
very
frauds
which
the
jury
in
the
first
trial
had
declared
by
their
verdict
he
had
not
committed
an
english
law
court
is
all
very
well
for
two
average
men
who
are
fighting
an
ordinary
business
dispute
that
what
it
made
for
but
to
judge
a
whistler
or
the
ability
or
the
immorality
of
an
artist
is
to
ask
the
court
to
do
what
it
is
wholly
unfit
to
do
there
is
not
a
judge
on
the
bench
whose
opinion
on
such
a
matter
is
worth
a
moment
consideration
and
the
jury
are
a
thousand
years
behind
the
judge
that
may
be
true
frank
but
i
can
not
help
it
do
forget
i
persisted
all
british
prejudices
will
be
against
you
here
is
a
father
the
fools
will
say
trying
to
protect
his
young
son
if
he
has
made
a
mistake
it
is
only
through
excess
of
laudable
zeal
you
would
have
to
prove
yourself
a
religious
maniac
in
order
to
have
any
chance
against
him
in
england
how
terrible
you
are
frank
you
know
it
is
bosie
douglas
who
wants
me
to
fight
and
my
solicitors
tell
me
i
shall
win
solicitors
live
on
quarrels
of
course
they
want
a
case
that
will
bring
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
pounds
into
their
pockets
besides
they
like
the
fight
they
will
have
all
the
kudos
of
it
and
the
fun
and
you
will
pay
the
piper
for
god
sake
do
be
led
into
it
that
way
madness
lies
but
frank
he
objected
weakly
how
can
i
sit
down
under
such
an
insult
i
must
do
something
that
another
story
i
replied
let
us
by
all
means
weigh
what
is
to
be
done
but
let
us
begin
by
putting
the
out
of
the
question
forget
that
you
are
challenged
to
mortal
combat
let
us
consider
how
the
challenge
should
be
met
but
we
wo
fight
under
queensberry
rules
because
queensberry
happens
to
be
the
aggressor
do
forget
that
if
you
lose
and
queensberry
goes
free
everyone
will
hold
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
nameless
vice
put
the
law
courts
out
of
your
head
whatever
else
you
do
you
must
not
bring
an
action
for
criminal
libel
against
queensberry
you
are
sure
to
lose
it
you
have
a
dog
chance
and
the
english
despise
the
beaten
vae
victis
do
commit
suicide
nothing
was
determined
when
the
time
came
to
part
this
conversation
took
place
i
believe
on
the
friday
or
saturday
i
spent
the
whole
of
sunday
trying
to
find
out
what
was
known
about
oscar
wilde
and
what
would
be
brought
up
against
him
i
wanted
to
know
too
how
he
was
regarded
in
an
ordinary
english
home
my
investigations
had
appalling
results
everyone
assumed
that
oscar
wilde
was
guilty
of
the
worst
that
had
ever
been
alleged
against
him
the
very
people
who
received
him
in
their
houses
condemned
him
pitilessly
and
as
i
approached
the
of
information
the
charges
became
more
and
more
definite
to
my
horror
in
the
public
prosecutor
office
his
guilt
was
said
to
be
known
and
classified
all
people
of
importance
agreed
that
he
would
lose
his
case
against
queensberry
no
english
jury
would
give
oscar
wilde
a
verdict
against
anyone
was
the
expert
opinion
how
unjust
i
cried
a
careless
shrug
was
the
only
reply
i
returned
home
from
my
enquiries
late
on
sunday
afternoon
and
in
a
few
minutes
oscar
called
by
appointment
i
told
him
i
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
he
must
not
go
on
with
the
prosecution
he
would
be
certain
to
lose
without
beating
about
the
bush
i
declared
that
he
had
no
earthly
chance
there
are
letters
i
said
which
are
infinitely
worse
than
your
published
writings
which
will
be
put
in
evidence
against
you
what
letters
do
you
mean
frank
he
questioned
the
wood
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
i
told
you
about
i
can
explain
all
of
them
you
paid
blackmail
to
wood
for
letters
you
had
written
to
douglas
i
replied
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
explain
that
fact
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
i
am
told
it
is
possible
that
witnesses
will
be
called
against
you
take
it
from
me
oscar
you
have
not
a
ghost
of
a
chance
tell
me
what
you
mean
frank
for
god
sake
he
cried
i
can
tell
you
in
a
word
i
replied
you
will
lose
your
case
i
have
promised
not
to
say
more
i
tried
to
persuade
him
by
his
vanity
you
must
remember
i
said
that
you
are
a
sort
of
standard
bearer
for
future
generations
if
you
lose
you
will
make
it
harder
for
all
writers
in
england
though
god
knows
it
is
hard
enough
already
you
will
put
back
the
hands
of
the
clock
for
fifty
years
i
seemed
almost
to
have
persuaded
him
he
questioned
me
what
is
the
alternative
frank
the
wisest
thing
to
do
in
your
opinion
tell
me
that
you
ought
to
go
abroad
i
replied
go
abroad
with
your
wife
and
let
queensberry
and
his
son
fight
out
their
own
miserable
quarrels
they
are
oh
frank
he
cried
how
can
i
do
that
sleep
on
it
i
replied
i
am
going
to
and
we
can
talk
it
all
over
in
a
day
or
two
but
i
must
know
he
said
wistfully
tomorrow
morning
frank
bernard
shaw
is
lunching
with
me
tomorrow
i
replied
at
the
cafe
royal
he
made
an
impatient
movement
of
his
head
he
usually
goes
early
i
went
on
and
if
you
like
to
come
after
three
we
can
have
a
talk
and
consider
it
all
may
i
bring
bosie
he
enquired
i
would
rather
you
did
not
i
replied
but
it
is
for
you
to
do
just
as
you
like
i
do
mind
saying
what
i
have
to
say
before
anyone
and
on
that
we
parted
somehow
or
other
next
day
at
lunch
both
shaw
and
i
got
interested
in
our
talk
and
we
were
both
at
the
table
when
oscar
came
in
i
introduced
them
but
they
had
met
before
shaw
stood
up
and
proposed
to
go
at
once
but
oscar
with
his
usual
courtesy
assured
him
that
he
would
be
glad
if
he
stayed
then
oscar
i
said
perhaps
you
wo
mind
shaw
hearing
what
i
advise
no
frank
i
do
mind
he
sighed
with
a
pitiful
air
of
depression
i
am
not
certain
and
my
notes
do
not
tell
me
whether
bosie
douglas
came
in
with
oscar
or
a
little
later
but
he
heard
the
greater
part
of
our
talk
i
put
the
matter
simply
first
of
all
i
said
we
start
with
the
certainty
that
you
are
going
to
lose
the
case
against
queensberry
you
must
give
it
up
drop
it
at
once
but
you
can
not
drop
it
and
stay
in
england
queensberry
would
probably
attack
you
again
and
again
i
know
him
well
he
is
half
a
savage
and
regards
pity
as
a
weakness
he
has
absolutely
no
consideration
for
others
you
should
go
abroad
and
as
ace
of
trumps
you
should
take
your
wife
with
you
now
for
the
excuse
i
would
sit
down
and
write
such
a
letter
as
you
alone
can
write
to
the
times
you
should
set
forth
how
you
have
been
insulted
by
the
marquis
of
queensberry
and
how
you
went
naturally
to
the
courts
for
a
remedy
but
you
found
out
very
soon
that
this
was
a
mistake
no
jury
would
give
a
verdict
against
a
father
however
mistaken
he
might
be
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
therefore
is
to
go
abroad
and
leave
the
whole
ring
with
its
gloves
and
ropes
its
sponges
and
pails
to
lord
queensberry
you
are
a
maker
of
beautiful
things
you
should
say
and
not
a
fighter
whereas
the
marquis
of
queensberry
takes
joy
only
in
fighting
you
refuse
to
fight
with
a
father
under
these
circumstances
oscar
seemed
to
be
inclined
to
do
as
i
proposed
i
appealed
to
shaw
and
shaw
said
he
thought
i
was
right
the
case
would
very
likely
go
against
oscar
a
jury
would
hardly
give
a
verdict
against
a
father
trying
to
protect
his
son
oscar
seemed
much
moved
i
think
it
was
about
this
time
that
bosie
douglas
came
in
at
oscar
request
i
repeated
my
argument
and
to
my
astonishment
douglas
got
up
at
once
and
cried
with
his
little
white
venomous
distorted
face
such
advice
shows
you
are
no
friend
of
oscar
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
in
wonderment
but
he
turned
and
left
the
room
on
the
spot
to
my
astonishment
oscar
also
got
up
it
is
not
friendly
of
you
frank
he
said
weakly
it
really
is
not
friendly
i
stared
at
him
he
was
parrotting
douglas
idiotic
words
do
be
absurd
i
said
but
he
repeated
no
frank
it
is
not
friendly
and
went
to
the
door
and
disappeared
like
a
flash
i
saw
part
at
least
of
the
truth
it
was
not
oscar
who
had
ever
misled
douglas
but
lord
alfred
douglas
who
was
driving
oscar
whither
he
would
i
turned
to
shaw
did
i
say
anything
in
the
heat
of
argument
that
could
have
offended
oscar
or
douglas
nothing
said
shaw
not
a
word
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
i
am
very
glad
that
bernard
shaw
has
lately
put
in
print
his
memory
of
this
conversation
the
above
account
was
printed
though
not
published
in
and
in
shaw
published
his
recollection
of
what
took
place
at
this
consultation
readers
may
judge
from
the
comparison
how
far
my
general
story
is
worthy
of
credence
in
the
introduction
to
his
playlet
the
dark
lady
of
the
sonnets
shaw
writes
yet
he
harris
knows
the
taste
and
the
value
of
humour
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
of
letters
who
really
appreciated
oscar
wilde
though
he
did
not
rally
fiercely
to
wilde
side
until
the
world
deserted
oscar
in
his
ruin
i
myself
was
present
at
a
curious
meeting
between
the
two
when
harris
on
the
eve
of
the
queensberry
trial
prophesied
to
wilde
with
miraculous
precision
exactly
what
immediately
afterwards
happened
to
him
and
warned
him
to
leave
the
country
it
was
the
first
time
within
my
knowledge
that
such
a
forecast
proved
true
wilde
though
under
no
illusion
as
to
the
folly
of
the
quite
unselfish
law
he
had
been
persuaded
to
begin
nevertheless
so
miscalculated
the
force
of
the
social
vengeance
he
was
unloosing
on
himself
that
he
fancied
it
could
be
stayed
by
putting
up
the
editor
of
the
saturday
review
as
harris
then
was
to
declare
that
he
considered
dorian
gray
a
highly
moral
book
which
it
certainly
is
when
harris
foretold
him
the
truth
wilde
denounced
him
as
a
friend
who
was
failing
him
in
his
hour
of
need
and
left
the
room
in
anger
harris
idiosyncratic
power
of
pity
saved
him
from
feeling
or
showing
the
smallest
resentment
and
events
presently
proved
to
wilde
how
insanely
he
had
been
advised
in
taking
the
action
and
how
accurately
harris
had
gauged
the
situation
left
to
myself
i
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
lord
alfred
douglas
proposed
to
himself
by
hounding
oscar
on
to
attack
his
father
i
was
still
more
surprised
by
his
white
bitter
face
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
it
left
on
me
while
groping
among
these
reflections
i
was
suddenly
struck
by
a
sort
of
likeness
a
similarity
of
expression
and
of
temper
between
lord
alfred
douglas
and
his
unhappy
father
i
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
little
face
blanched
with
rage
and
the
wild
hating
eyes
the
shrill
voice
too
was
queensberry
chapter
xiii
oscar
attacks
queensberry
and
is
worsted
it
was
weakness
in
oscar
and
not
strength
that
allowed
him
to
be
driven
to
the
conflict
by
lord
alfred
douglas
it
was
his
weakness
again
which
prevented
him
from
abandoning
the
prosecution
once
it
was
begun
such
a
resolution
would
have
involved
a
breaking
away
from
his
associates
and
from
his
friends
a
personal
assertion
of
will
of
which
he
was
incapable
again
and
again
he
answered
my
urging
with
i
ca
frank
i
ca
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
defence
was
growing
bolder
it
was
announced
one
morning
in
the
newspapers
that
lord
queensberry
instead
of
pleading
paternal
privilege
and
minimising
his
accusation
was
determined
to
justify
the
libel
and
declare
that
it
was
true
in
every
particular
oscar
could
only
say
weakly
i
ca
help
it
frank
i
ca
do
anything
you
only
distress
me
by
predicting
disaster
the
fibres
of
resolution
never
strong
in
him
had
been
destroyed
by
years
of
while
the
influence
whipping
him
was
stronger
than
i
guessed
he
was
hurried
like
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
although
everyone
who
cared
to
think
knew
that
queensberry
would
win
the
case
many
persons
believed
that
oscar
would
make
a
brilliant
intellectual
fight
and
carry
off
the
honours
if
not
the
verdict
the
trial
took
place
at
the
central
criminal
court
on
april
justice
collins
was
the
judge
and
the
case
was
conducted
at
first
with
the
outward
seemliness
and
propriety
which
are
so
peculiarly
english
an
hour
before
the
opening
of
the
case
the
court
was
crowded
not
a
seat
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
even
standing
room
was
at
a
premium
the
counsel
were
the
best
at
the
bar
sir
edward
clarke
charles
mathews
and
travers
humphreys
for
the
prosecution
carson
gill
and
gill
for
the
defence
besley
and
monckton
watched
the
case
it
was
said
for
the
brothers
lord
douglas
of
hawick
and
lord
alfred
douglas
while
waiting
for
the
judge
the
buzz
of
talk
in
the
court
grew
loud
everybody
agreed
that
the
presence
of
sir
edward
clarke
gave
oscar
an
advantage
carson
was
not
so
well
known
then
as
he
has
since
become
he
was
regarded
as
a
irishman
who
had
still
his
spurs
to
win
some
knew
he
had
been
at
school
with
oscar
and
at
trinity
college
was
as
high
in
the
second
class
as
oscar
was
in
the
first
it
was
said
he
envied
oscar
his
reputation
for
brilliance
suddenly
the
loud
voice
of
the
clerk
called
for
silence
as
the
judge
appeared
everyone
stood
up
and
in
complete
stillness
sir
edward
clarke
opened
for
the
prosecution
the
bleak
face
long
upper
lip
and
severe
side
whiskers
made
the
little
man
look
exactly
like
a
nonconformist
parson
of
the
old
days
but
his
tone
and
manner
were
modern
quiet
and
conversational
the
charge
he
said
was
that
the
defendant
had
published
a
false
and
malicious
libel
against
oscar
wilde
the
libel
was
in
the
form
of
a
card
which
lord
queensberry
had
left
at
a
club
to
which
oscar
wilde
belonged
it
could
not
be
justified
unless
the
statements
written
on
the
card
were
true
it
would
however
have
been
possible
to
have
excused
the
card
by
a
strong
feeling
a
mistaken
feeling
on
the
part
of
a
father
but
the
plea
which
the
defendant
had
brought
before
the
court
raised
graver
issues
he
said
that
the
statement
was
true
and
was
made
for
the
public
benefit
there
were
besides
a
series
of
accusations
in
the
plea
everyone
held
his
breath
mentioning
names
of
persons
and
it
was
said
with
regard
to
these
persons
that
wilde
had
solicited
them
to
commit
a
grave
offence
and
that
he
had
been
guilty
with
each
and
all
of
them
of
indecent
practices
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
my
worst
forebodings
were
more
than
justified
vaguely
i
heard
clarke
voice
grave
responsibility
serious
allegations
credible
witnesses
oscar
wilde
was
the
son
of
sir
william
wilde
the
voice
droned
on
and
i
awoke
to
feverish
clearness
of
brain
queensberry
had
turned
the
defence
into
a
prosecution
why
had
he
taken
the
risk
who
had
given
him
the
new
and
precise
information
i
felt
that
there
was
nothing
before
oscar
but
ruin
absolute
could
anything
be
done
even
now
he
could
go
abroad
even
now
i
resolved
once
more
to
try
and
induce
him
to
fly
my
interest
turned
from
these
passionate
imaginings
to
the
actual
would
sir
edward
clarke
fight
the
case
as
it
should
be
fought
he
had
begun
to
tell
of
the
friendship
between
oscar
wilde
and
lord
alfred
douglas
the
friendship
too
between
oscar
wilde
and
lady
queensberry
who
on
her
own
petition
had
been
divorced
from
the
marquis
would
he
go
on
to
paint
the
terrible
that
existed
between
lord
alfred
douglas
and
his
father
and
show
how
oscar
had
been
dragged
into
the
bitter
family
squabble
to
the
legal
mind
this
had
but
little
to
do
with
the
case
we
got
instead
a
dry
relation
of
the
facts
which
have
already
been
set
forth
in
this
history
wright
the
porter
of
the
albemarle
club
was
called
to
say
that
lord
queensberry
had
handed
him
the
card
produced
witness
had
looked
at
the
card
did
not
understand
it
but
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
gave
it
to
wilde
oscar
wilde
was
then
called
and
went
into
the
witness
box
he
looked
a
little
grave
but
was
composed
and
serious
sir
edward
clarke
took
him
briefly
through
the
incidents
of
his
life
his
successes
at
school
and
the
university
the
attempts
made
to
blackmail
him
the
insults
of
lord
queensberry
and
then
directed
his
attention
to
the
allegations
in
the
plea
impugning
his
conduct
with
different
persons
oscar
wilde
declared
that
there
was
no
truth
in
any
of
these
statements
hereupon
sir
edward
clarke
sat
down
carson
rose
and
the
death
duel
began
carson
brought
out
that
oscar
wilde
was
forty
years
of
age
and
lord
alfred
douglas
down
to
the
interview
in
tite
street
lord
queensberry
had
been
friendly
with
wilde
had
wilde
written
in
a
publication
called
the
chameleon
yes
had
he
written
there
a
story
called
priest
and
the
acolyte
no
was
that
story
immoral
oscar
amused
everyone
by
replying
much
worse
than
immoral
it
was
badly
written
but
feeling
that
this
gibe
was
too
light
for
the
occasion
he
added
it
was
altogether
offensive
and
perfect
twaddle
he
admitted
at
once
that
he
did
not
express
his
disapproval
of
it
it
was
beneath
him
to
concern
himself
with
the
effusions
of
an
illiterate
undergraduate
did
wilde
ever
consider
the
effect
in
his
writings
of
inciting
to
immorality
oscar
declared
that
he
aimed
neither
at
good
nor
evil
but
tried
to
make
a
beautiful
thing
when
questioned
as
to
the
immorality
in
thought
in
the
article
in
the
chameleon
he
retorted
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
morality
or
immorality
in
thought
a
hum
of
understanding
and
approval
ran
through
the
court
the
intellect
is
profoundly
amoral
again
and
again
he
scored
in
this
way
off
carson
no
work
of
art
ever
puts
forward
views
views
belong
to
the
philistines
and
not
to
artists
what
do
you
think
of
this
view
i
do
think
of
any
views
except
my
own
all
this
while
carson
had
been
hitting
at
a
man
on
his
own
level
but
oscar
wilde
was
above
him
and
not
one
of
his
blows
had
taken
effect
every
moment
too
oscar
grew
more
and
more
at
his
ease
and
the
combat
seemed
to
be
turning
completely
in
his
favour
carson
at
length
took
up
dorian
gray
and
began
on
passages
in
it
you
talk
about
one
man
adoring
another
did
you
ever
adore
any
man
no
replied
oscar
quietly
i
have
never
adored
anyone
but
myself
the
court
roared
with
laughter
oscar
went
on
there
are
people
in
the
world
i
regret
to
say
who
can
not
understand
the
deep
affection
that
an
artist
can
feel
for
a
friend
with
a
beautiful
personality
he
was
then
questioned
about
his
letter
already
quoted
here
to
lord
alfred
douglas
it
was
a
he
said
written
in
answer
to
a
sonnet
he
had
not
written
to
other
people
in
the
same
strain
not
even
to
lord
alfred
douglas
again
he
did
not
repeat
himself
in
style
carson
read
another
letter
from
oscar
wilde
to
lord
alfred
douglas
which
paints
their
relations
with
extraordinary
exactness
here
it
is
savoy
hotel
victoria
embankment
london
dearest
of
all
boys
your
letter
was
delightful
red
and
yellow
wine
to
me
but
i
am
sad
and
out
of
sorts
bosie
you
must
not
make
scenes
with
me
they
kill
me
they
wreck
the
loveliness
of
life
i
can
not
see
you
so
greek
and
gracious
distorted
with
passion
i
can
not
listen
to
your
curved
lips
saying
hideous
things
to
me
i
would
sooner
a
word
is
indecipherable
carson
went
on
i
will
ask
the
witness
the
words
which
carson
could
not
read
were
i
would
sooner
be
rented
than
etc
rent
is
a
slang
term
for
blackmail
than
have
you
bitter
unjust
hating
i
must
see
you
soon
you
are
the
divine
thing
i
want
the
thing
of
genius
and
beauty
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
shall
i
come
to
salisbury
my
bill
here
is
for
a
week
i
have
also
got
a
new
why
are
you
not
here
my
dear
my
wonderful
boy
i
fear
i
must
leave
no
money
no
credit
and
a
heart
of
lead
your
own
oscar
oscar
said
that
it
was
an
expression
of
his
tender
admiration
for
lord
alfred
douglas
you
have
said
carson
went
on
that
all
the
statements
about
persons
in
the
plea
of
justification
were
false
do
you
still
hold
to
that
assertion
i
do
carson
then
paused
and
looked
at
the
judge
justice
collins
shuffled
his
papers
together
and
announced
that
the
would
be
continued
on
the
morrow
as
the
judge
went
out
all
the
tongues
in
the
court
broke
loose
oscar
was
surrounded
by
friends
congratulating
him
and
rejoicing
i
was
not
so
happy
and
went
away
to
think
the
matter
out
i
tried
to
keep
up
my
courage
by
recalling
the
humorous
things
oscar
had
said
during
the
examination
i
recalled
too
the
dull
commonplaces
of
carson
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
it
was
all
going
on
very
well
but
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
realised
that
oscar
answers
characteristic
and
clever
as
many
of
them
were
had
not
impressed
the
jury
were
indeed
rather
calculated
to
alienate
them
he
had
taken
the
purely
artistic
standpoint
had
not
attempted
to
go
higher
and
reach
a
synthesis
which
would
conciliate
the
philistine
jurymen
as
well
as
the
thinking
public
and
the
judge
carson
was
in
closer
touch
with
the
jury
being
nearer
their
intellectual
level
and
there
was
a
terrible
menace
in
his
last
words
tomorrow
i
said
to
myself
he
will
begin
to
examine
about
persons
and
not
books
he
did
not
win
on
the
literary
question
but
he
was
right
to
bring
it
in
the
passages
he
had
quoted
and
especially
oscar
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
had
created
a
strong
prejudice
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
they
ought
not
to
have
had
this
effect
i
thought
but
they
had
my
contempt
for
courts
of
law
deepened
those
twelve
jurymen
were
anything
but
the
peers
of
the
accused
how
could
they
judge
him
the
second
day
of
the
trial
was
very
different
from
the
first
there
seemed
to
be
a
gloom
over
the
court
oscar
went
into
the
box
as
if
it
had
been
the
dock
he
had
lost
all
his
spring
carson
settled
down
to
the
with
apparent
zest
it
was
evident
from
his
mere
manner
that
he
was
coming
to
what
he
regarded
as
the
strong
part
of
his
case
he
began
by
examining
oscar
as
to
his
intimacy
with
a
person
named
taylor
has
taylor
been
to
your
house
and
to
your
chambers
yes
have
you
been
to
taylor
rooms
to
afternoon
tea
parties
yes
did
taylor
rooms
strike
you
as
peculiar
they
were
pretty
rooms
have
you
ever
seen
them
lit
by
anything
else
but
candles
even
in
the
day
time
i
think
so
i
not
sure
have
you
ever
met
there
a
young
man
called
wood
on
one
occasion
have
you
ever
met
sidney
mavor
there
at
tea
it
is
possible
what
was
your
connection
with
taylor
taylor
was
a
friend
a
young
man
of
intelligence
and
education
he
had
been
to
a
good
english
school
did
you
know
taylor
was
being
watched
by
the
police
no
did
you
know
that
taylor
was
arrested
with
a
man
named
parker
in
a
raid
made
last
year
on
a
house
in
fitzroy
square
i
read
of
it
in
the
newspaper
did
that
cause
you
to
drop
your
acquaintance
with
taylor
no
taylor
explained
to
me
that
he
had
gone
there
to
a
dance
and
that
the
magistrate
had
dismissed
the
case
against
him
did
you
get
taylor
to
arrange
dinners
for
you
to
meet
young
men
no
i
have
dined
with
taylor
at
a
restaurant
how
many
young
men
has
taylor
introduced
to
you
five
in
all
did
you
give
money
or
presents
to
these
five
i
may
have
done
did
they
give
you
anything
nothing
among
the
five
men
taylor
introduced
you
to
was
one
named
parker
yes
did
you
get
on
friendly
terms
with
him
yes
did
you
call
him
and
allow
him
to
call
you
yes
how
old
was
parker
i
do
keep
a
census
of
people
ages
it
would
be
vulgar
to
ask
people
their
age
where
did
you
first
meet
parker
i
invited
taylor
to
kettner
a
famous
italian
restaurant
in
soho
it
had
several
private
rooms
on
the
occasion
of
my
birthday
and
told
him
to
bring
what
friends
he
liked
he
brought
parker
and
his
brother
did
you
know
parker
was
a
gentleman
servant
out
of
work
and
his
brother
a
groom
no
i
did
not
but
you
did
know
that
parker
was
not
a
literary
character
or
an
artist
and
that
culture
was
not
his
strong
point
i
did
what
was
there
in
common
between
you
and
charlie
parker
i
like
people
who
are
young
bright
happy
careless
and
original
i
do
not
like
them
sensible
and
i
do
not
like
them
old
i
do
like
social
distinctions
of
any
kind
and
the
mere
fact
of
youth
is
so
wonderful
to
me
that
i
would
sooner
talk
to
a
young
man
for
half
an
hour
than
be
cross
examined
by
an
elderly
everyone
smiled
at
this
retort
had
you
chambers
in
james
place
yes
from
october
to
april
did
charlie
parker
go
and
have
tea
with
you
there
yes
did
you
give
him
money
i
gave
him
three
or
four
pounds
because
he
said
he
was
hard
up
what
did
he
give
you
in
return
nothing
did
you
give
charlie
parker
a
silver
cigarette
case
at
christmas
i
did
did
you
visit
him
one
night
at
at
park
walk
chelsea
i
did
not
did
you
write
him
any
beautiful
i
do
think
so
did
you
know
that
charlie
parker
had
enlisted
in
the
army
i
have
heard
so
when
you
heard
that
taylor
was
arrested
what
did
you
do
i
was
greatly
distressed
and
wrote
to
tell
him
so
when
did
you
first
meet
fred
atkins
in
october
or
november
did
he
tell
you
that
he
was
employed
by
a
firm
of
bookmakers
he
may
have
done
not
a
literary
man
or
an
artist
was
he
no
what
age
was
he
nineteen
or
twenty
did
you
ask
him
to
dinner
at
kettner
i
think
i
met
him
at
a
dinner
at
kettner
was
taylor
at
the
dinner
he
may
have
been
did
you
meet
him
afterwards
i
did
did
you
call
him
and
let
him
call
you
yes
did
you
go
to
paris
with
him
yes
did
you
give
him
money
yes
was
there
ever
any
impropriety
between
you
no
when
did
you
first
meet
ernest
scarfe
in
december
who
introduced
him
to
you
taylor
scarfe
was
out
of
work
was
he
not
he
may
have
been
did
taylor
bring
scarfe
to
you
at
james
place
yes
did
you
give
scarfe
a
cigarette
case
yes
it
was
my
custom
to
give
cigarette
cases
to
people
i
liked
when
did
you
first
meet
mavor
in
did
you
give
him
money
or
a
cigarette
case
a
cigarette
case
did
you
know
walter
grainger
and
so
on
till
the
very
air
in
the
court
seemed
peopled
with
spectres
on
the
whole
oscar
bore
the
very
well
but
he
made
one
appalling
slip
carson
was
pressing
him
as
to
his
relations
with
the
boy
grainger
who
had
been
employed
in
lord
alfred
douglas
rooms
in
oxford
did
you
ever
kiss
him
he
asked
oscar
answered
carelessly
oh
dear
no
he
was
a
peculiarly
plain
boy
he
was
unfortunately
extremely
ugly
i
pitied
him
for
it
was
that
the
reason
why
you
did
not
kiss
him
oh
carson
you
are
pertinently
insolent
did
you
say
that
in
support
of
your
statement
that
you
never
kissed
him
no
it
is
a
childish
question
but
carson
was
not
to
be
warded
off
like
a
terrier
he
sprang
again
and
again
why
sir
did
you
mention
that
this
boy
was
extremely
ugly
for
this
reason
if
i
were
asked
why
i
did
not
kiss
a
i
should
say
because
i
do
not
like
to
kiss
why
did
you
mention
his
ugliness
it
is
ridiculous
to
imagine
that
any
such
thing
could
have
occurred
under
any
circumstances
then
why
did
you
mention
his
ugliness
i
ask
you
because
you
insulted
me
by
an
insulting
question
was
that
a
reason
why
you
should
say
the
boy
was
ugly
here
the
witness
began
several
answers
almost
inarticulately
and
finished
none
of
them
his
efforts
to
collect
his
ideas
were
not
aided
by
sharp
staccato
repetition
why
why
why
did
you
add
that
at
last
the
witness
answered
you
sting
me
and
insult
me
and
at
times
one
says
things
flippantly
then
came
the
by
sir
edward
clarke
which
brought
out
very
clearly
the
hatred
of
lord
alfred
douglas
for
his
father
letters
were
read
and
in
one
letter
queensberry
declared
that
oscar
had
plainly
shown
the
white
feather
when
he
called
on
him
one
felt
that
this
was
probably
true
queensberry
word
on
such
a
point
could
be
accepted
in
the
reexamination
sir
edward
clarke
occupied
himself
chiefly
with
two
youths
shelley
and
conway
who
had
been
passed
over
casually
by
carson
in
answer
to
his
questions
oscar
stated
that
shelley
was
a
youth
in
the
employ
of
mathews
and
lane
the
publishers
shelley
had
very
good
taste
in
literature
and
a
great
desire
for
culture
shelley
had
read
all
his
books
and
liked
them
shelley
had
dined
with
him
and
his
wife
at
tite
street
shelley
was
in
every
way
a
gentleman
he
had
never
gone
with
charlie
parker
to
the
savoy
hotel
a
juryman
wanted
to
know
at
this
point
whether
the
witness
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
article
the
priest
and
the
acolyte
in
the
chameleon
i
knew
nothing
of
it
it
came
as
a
terrible
shock
to
me
this
answer
contrasted
strangely
with
the
light
tone
of
his
reply
to
the
same
question
on
the
previous
day
the
reexamination
did
not
improve
oscar
position
it
left
all
the
facts
where
they
were
and
at
least
a
suspicion
in
every
mind
sir
edward
clarke
intimated
that
this
concluded
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
whereupon
carson
rose
to
make
the
opening
speech
for
the
defence
i
was
shivering
with
apprehension
he
began
by
admitting
the
grave
responsibility
resting
on
lord
queensberry
who
accepted
it
to
the
fullest
lord
queensberry
was
justified
in
doing
all
he
could
do
to
cut
short
an
acquaintance
which
must
be
disastrous
to
his
son
carson
wished
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
fact
that
all
these
men
with
whom
wilde
went
about
were
discharged
servants
and
grooms
and
that
they
were
all
about
the
same
age
he
asked
the
jury
also
to
note
that
taylor
who
was
the
pivot
of
the
whole
case
had
not
yet
been
put
in
the
box
why
not
he
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that
the
very
same
idea
that
was
set
forth
in
the
priest
and
the
acolyte
was
contained
in
oscar
wilde
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
and
the
same
idea
was
to
be
found
in
lord
alfred
douglas
poem
the
two
loves
this
early
poem
of
lord
alfred
douglas
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
at
the
end
of
this
book
together
with
another
poem
by
the
same
author
which
was
also
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
trial
which
was
published
in
the
chameleon
he
went
on
to
say
that
when
in
the
story
of
the
priest
and
the
acolyte
the
boy
was
discovered
in
the
priest
bed
carson
here
made
a
mistake
there
is
no
such
incident
in
the
story
the
error
merely
shows
how
prejudiced
his
mind
was
the
priest
made
the
same
defence
as
wilde
had
made
that
the
world
does
not
understand
the
beauty
of
this
love
the
same
idea
was
found
again
in
dorian
gray
and
he
read
two
or
three
passages
from
the
book
in
support
of
this
statement
wilde
had
described
his
letter
to
lord
alfred
douglas
as
a
prose
sonnet
he
would
read
it
again
to
the
court
and
he
read
both
the
letters
wilde
says
they
are
beautiful
he
went
on
i
call
them
an
abominable
piece
of
disgusting
immorality
at
this
the
judge
again
shuffled
his
papers
together
and
whispered
in
a
quiet
voice
that
the
court
would
sit
on
the
morrow
and
left
the
room
the
honours
of
the
day
had
all
been
with
carson
oscar
left
the
box
in
a
depressed
way
one
or
two
friends
came
towards
him
but
the
majority
held
aloof
and
in
almost
unbroken
silence
everyone
slipped
out
of
the
court
strange
to
say
in
my
mind
there
was
just
a
ray
of
hope
carson
was
still
laying
stress
on
the
article
in
the
chameleon
and
scattered
passages
in
dorian
gray
on
oscar
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
and
lord
alfred
douglas
poems
in
the
chameleon
he
must
see
i
thought
that
all
this
was
extremely
weak
sir
edward
clarke
could
be
trusted
to
tear
all
such
arguments
founded
on
literary
work
to
shreds
there
was
room
for
more
than
reasonable
doubt
about
all
such
things
why
had
not
carson
put
some
of
the
young
men
he
spoke
of
in
the
box
would
he
be
able
to
do
that
he
talked
of
taylor
as
the
pivot
of
the
case
and
gibed
at
the
prosecution
for
not
putting
taylor
in
the
box
would
he
put
taylor
in
the
box
and
why
if
he
had
such
witnesses
at
his
beck
and
call
should
he
lay
stress
on
the
flimsy
weak
evidence
to
be
drawn
from
passages
in
books
and
poems
and
letters
one
thing
was
clear
if
he
was
able
to
put
any
of
the
young
men
in
the
box
about
whom
he
had
examined
oscar
oscar
was
ruined
even
if
he
rested
his
defence
on
the
letters
and
poems
he
win
and
oscar
would
be
discredited
for
already
it
was
clear
that
no
jury
would
give
oscar
wilde
a
verdict
against
a
father
trying
to
protect
his
son
the
issue
had
narrowed
down
to
terrible
straits
would
it
be
utter
ruin
to
oscar
or
merely
loss
of
the
case
and
reputation
we
had
only
sixteen
hours
to
wait
they
seemed
to
me
to
hold
the
last
hope
i
drove
to
tite
street
hoping
to
see
oscar
i
was
convinced
that
carson
had
important
witnesses
at
his
command
and
that
the
outcome
of
the
case
would
be
disastrous
why
should
not
oscar
even
now
this
very
evening
cross
to
calais
leaving
a
letter
for
his
counsel
and
the
court
abandoning
the
idiotic
prosecution
the
house
at
tite
street
seemed
deserted
for
some
time
no
one
answered
my
knocking
and
ringing
and
then
a
simply
told
me
that
wilde
was
not
in
he
did
not
know
whether
wilde
was
expected
back
or
not
did
not
think
he
was
coming
back
i
turned
and
went
home
i
thought
oscar
would
probably
say
to
me
again
i
can
do
nothing
frank
nothing
the
feeling
in
the
court
next
morning
was
good
tempered
even
jaunty
the
benches
were
filled
with
young
barristers
all
of
whom
had
made
up
their
minds
that
the
testimony
would
be
what
one
of
them
called
nifty
everyone
treated
the
case
as
practically
over
but
will
carson
call
witnesses
i
asked
of
course
he
will
they
said
but
in
any
case
wilde
does
not
stand
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
a
verdict
against
queensberry
he
was
a
bally
fool
to
bring
such
an
action
the
question
is
said
someone
will
wilde
face
the
music
my
heart
leapt
perhaps
he
had
gone
fled
already
to
france
to
avoid
this
dreadful
useless
torture
i
could
see
the
hounds
with
open
mouths
dripping
white
fangs
and
greedy
eyes
all
closing
in
on
the
defenceless
quarry
would
the
huntsman
give
the
word
we
were
not
left
long
in
doubt
carson
continued
his
statement
for
the
defence
he
had
sufficiently
demonstrated
to
the
jury
he
thought
that
so
far
as
lord
queensberry
was
concerned
he
was
absolutely
justified
in
bringing
to
a
climax
in
the
way
he
had
the
connection
between
oscar
wilde
and
his
son
a
dramatic
pause
a
moment
later
the
clever
advocate
resumed
unfortunately
he
had
a
more
painful
part
of
the
case
to
approach
it
would
be
his
painful
duty
to
bring
before
them
one
after
the
other
the
young
men
he
had
examined
wilde
about
and
allow
them
to
tell
their
tales
in
no
one
of
these
cases
were
these
young
men
on
an
equality
in
any
way
with
wilde
wilde
had
told
them
that
there
was
something
beautiful
and
charming
about
youth
which
led
him
to
make
these
acquaintances
that
was
a
travesty
of
the
facts
wilde
preferred
to
know
nothing
of
these
young
men
and
their
antecedents
he
knew
nothing
about
wood
he
knew
nothing
about
parker
he
knew
nothing
about
scarfe
nothing
about
conway
and
not
much
about
taylor
the
truth
was
taylor
was
the
procurer
for
wilde
and
the
jury
would
hear
from
this
young
man
parker
who
would
have
to
tell
his
unfortunate
story
to
them
that
he
was
poor
out
of
a
place
had
no
money
and
unfortunately
fell
a
victim
to
wilde
sir
edward
clarke
here
left
the
court
on
the
first
evening
they
met
wilde
called
parker
charlie
and
parker
called
wilde
oscar
it
may
be
a
very
noble
instinct
in
some
people
to
wish
to
break
down
social
barriers
but
wilde
conduct
was
not
ordered
by
generous
instincts
luxurious
dinners
and
champagne
were
not
the
way
to
assist
a
poor
man
parker
would
tell
them
that
after
this
first
dinner
wilde
invited
him
to
drive
with
him
to
the
savoy
hotel
wilde
had
not
told
them
why
he
had
that
suite
of
rooms
at
the
savoy
hotel
parker
would
tell
them
what
happened
on
arriving
there
this
was
the
scandal
lord
queensberry
had
referred
to
in
his
letter
as
far
back
as
june
or
july
last
year
the
jury
would
wonder
not
at
the
reports
having
reached
lord
queensberry
ears
but
that
oscar
wilde
had
been
tolerated
in
london
society
as
long
as
he
had
been
parker
had
since
enlisted
in
the
army
and
bore
a
good
character
wilde
himself
had
said
that
parker
was
respectable
parker
would
reluctantly
present
himself
to
tell
his
story
to
the
jury
all
this
time
the
court
was
hushed
with
awe
and
wonder
everyone
was
asking
what
on
earth
had
induced
wilde
to
begin
the
prosecution
what
madness
had
driven
him
and
why
had
he
listened
to
the
insane
advice
to
bring
the
action
when
he
must
have
known
the
sort
of
evidence
which
could
be
brought
against
him
after
promising
to
produce
parker
and
the
others
carson
stopped
speaking
and
began
looking
through
his
papers
when
he
began
again
everyone
held
his
breath
what
was
coming
now
he
proceeded
in
the
same
and
serious
way
to
deal
with
the
case
of
the
youth
conway
conway
it
appeared
had
known
wilde
and
his
family
at
worthing
conway
was
sixteen
years
of
age
at
this
moment
sir
edward
clarke
returned
with
charles
mathews
and
asked
permission
of
the
judge
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
carson
at
the
close
of
a
few
minutes
talk
between
the
counsel
sir
edward
clarke
rose
and
told
the
judge
that
after
communicating
with
oscar
wilde
he
thought
it
better
to
withdraw
the
prosecution
and
submit
to
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
he
minimised
the
defeat
he
declared
that
in
respect
to
matters
connected
with
literature
and
the
letters
he
could
not
resist
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
lord
queensberry
had
not
used
a
direct
accusation
but
the
words
posing
as
etc
besides
he
wished
to
spare
the
jury
the
necessity
of
investigating
in
detail
matter
of
the
most
appalling
character
he
wished
to
make
an
end
of
the
case
and
he
sat
down
why
on
earth
did
sir
edward
clarke
not
advise
oscar
in
this
way
weeks
before
why
did
he
not
tell
him
his
case
could
not
possibly
be
won
i
have
heard
since
on
excellent
authority
that
before
taking
up
the
case
sir
edward
clarke
asked
oscar
wilde
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not
and
accepted
in
good
faith
his
assurance
that
he
was
innocent
as
soon
as
he
realised
in
court
the
strength
of
the
case
against
oscar
he
advised
him
to
abandon
the
prosecution
to
his
astonishment
oscar
was
eager
to
abandon
it
sir
edward
clarke
afterwards
defended
his
unfortunate
client
out
of
loyalty
and
pity
oscar
again
assuring
him
of
his
innocence
carson
rose
at
once
and
insisted
as
was
his
right
that
this
verdict
of
not
guilty
must
be
understood
to
mean
that
lord
queensberry
had
succeeded
in
his
plea
of
justification
justice
collins
thought
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
function
of
the
judge
and
jury
to
insist
on
wading
through
prurient
details
which
had
no
bearing
on
the
matter
at
issue
which
had
already
been
decided
by
the
consent
of
the
prosecutors
to
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
such
a
verdict
meant
of
course
that
the
plea
of
justification
was
proved
the
jury
having
consulted
for
a
few
moments
the
clerk
of
arraigns
asked
do
you
find
the
plea
of
justification
has
been
proved
or
not
foreman
yes
you
say
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
that
is
the
verdict
of
you
all
foreman
yes
and
we
also
find
that
it
is
for
the
public
benefit
the
last
kick
to
the
dead
lion
as
the
verdict
was
read
out
the
spectators
in
the
court
burst
into
cheers
carson
of
course
the
costs
of
the
defence
will
follow
justice
collins
yes
gill
and
lord
queensberry
may
be
discharged
justice
collins
certainly
the
marquis
of
queensberry
left
the
dock
amid
renewed
cheering
which
was
taken
up
again
and
again
in
the
street
chapter
xiv
how
genius
is
persecuted
in
england
the
english
are
very
proud
of
their
sense
of
justice
proud
too
of
their
roman
law
and
the
practice
of
the
courts
in
which
they
have
incorporated
it
they
boast
of
their
fair
play
in
all
things
as
the
french
boast
of
their
lightness
and
if
you
question
it
you
lose
caste
with
them
as
one
prejudiced
or
ignorant
or
both
english
justice
can
not
be
bought
they
say
and
if
it
is
dear
excessively
dear
even
they
rather
like
to
feel
they
have
paid
a
long
price
for
a
good
article
yet
it
may
be
that
here
as
in
other
things
they
take
outward
propriety
and
decorum
for
the
inward
and
ineffable
grace
that
a
judge
should
be
incorruptible
is
not
so
important
as
that
he
should
be
wise
and
humane
english
journalists
and
barristers
were
very
much
amused
at
the
conduct
of
the
dreyfus
case
yet
when
dreyfus
was
being
tried
for
the
second
time
in
france
two
or
three
instances
of
similar
injustice
in
england
were
set
forth
with
circumstance
in
one
of
the
london
newspapers
but
no
one
paid
any
effective
attention
to
them
if
dreyfus
had
been
convicted
in
england
it
is
probable
that
no
voice
would
ever
have
been
raised
in
his
favour
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
there
would
never
have
been
a
second
trial
a
keen
sense
of
abstract
justice
is
only
to
be
found
in
conjunction
with
a
rich
fount
of
imaginative
sympathy
the
english
are
too
to
take
much
interest
in
their
neighbours
affairs
too
busy
to
care
for
abstract
questions
of
right
or
wrong
before
the
trial
of
oscar
wilde
i
still
believed
that
in
a
criminal
case
rough
justice
would
be
done
in
england
the
bias
of
an
english
judge
i
said
to
myself
is
always
in
favour
of
the
accused
it
is
an
honourable
tradition
of
english
procedure
that
even
the
treasury
barristers
should
state
rather
less
than
they
can
prove
against
the
unfortunate
person
who
is
being
attacked
by
all
the
power
and
authority
of
the
state
i
was
soon
forced
to
see
that
these
honourable
and
praiseworthy
conventions
were
as
withes
of
straw
in
the
fire
of
english
prejudice
the
first
thing
to
set
me
doubting
was
that
the
judge
did
not
try
to
check
the
cheering
in
court
after
the
verdict
in
favour
of
lord
queensberry
english
judges
always
resent
and
resist
such
popular
outbursts
why
not
in
this
case
after
all
no
judge
could
think
queensberry
a
hero
he
was
too
well
known
for
that
and
yet
the
cheering
swelled
again
and
again
and
the
judge
gathered
up
his
papers
without
a
word
and
went
his
way
as
if
he
were
deaf
a
dreadful
apprehension
crept
over
me
in
spite
of
myself
i
began
to
realise
that
my
belief
in
english
justice
might
be
altogether
mistaken
it
was
to
me
as
if
the
solid
earth
had
become
a
quaking
bog
or
indeed
as
if
a
child
had
suddenly
discovered
its
parent
to
be
shameless
the
subsequent
trials
are
among
the
most
painful
experiences
of
my
life
i
shall
try
to
set
down
all
the
incidents
fairly
one
peculiarity
had
first
struck
me
in
the
conduct
of
the
case
between
oscar
wilde
and
lord
queensberry
that
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
any
of
the
numberless
journalists
and
writers
who
commented
on
the
trial
it
was
apparent
from
his
letter
to
his
son
which
i
published
in
a
previous
chapter
and
from
the
fact
that
he
called
at
oscar
wilde
house
that
lord
queensberry
at
the
beginning
did
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
his
accusations
he
set
them
forth
as
a
violent
man
sets
forth
hearsay
and
suspicion
knowing
that
as
a
father
he
could
do
this
with
impunity
and
accordingly
at
first
he
pleaded
privilege
some
time
between
the
beginning
of
the
prosecution
and
the
trial
he
obtained
an
immense
amount
of
unexpected
evidence
he
then
justified
his
libel
and
gave
the
names
of
the
persons
whom
he
intended
to
call
to
prove
his
case
where
did
he
get
this
new
knowledge
i
have
spoken
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
of
enemies
asserting
that
the
english
as
puritans
detested
his
attitude
and
way
of
life
and
if
some
fanatic
or
representative
of
the
nonconformist
conscience
had
hunted
up
evidence
against
wilde
and
brought
him
to
ruin
there
would
have
been
nothing
extraordinary
in
a
vengeance
which
might
have
been
regarded
as
a
duty
strange
to
say
the
effective
hatred
of
oscar
wilde
was
shown
by
a
man
of
the
upper
class
who
was
anything
but
a
puritan
it
was
charles
brookfield
i
believe
who
constituted
himself
private
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
raked
piccadilly
to
find
witnesses
against
oscar
wilde
brookfield
was
afterwards
appointed
censor
of
plays
on
the
strength
apparently
of
having
himself
written
one
of
the
riskiest
plays
of
the
period
as
i
do
not
know
brookfield
i
will
not
judge
him
but
his
appointment
always
seemed
to
me
even
before
i
knew
that
he
had
acted
against
wilde
curiously
characteristic
of
english
life
and
of
the
casual
contemptuous
way
englishmen
of
the
governing
class
regard
letters
in
the
same
spirit
lord
salisbury
as
prime
minister
made
a
journalist
poet
laureate
simply
because
he
had
puffed
him
for
years
in
the
columns
of
the
standard
lord
salisbury
probably
neither
knew
nor
cared
that
alfred
austin
had
never
written
a
line
that
could
live
one
thing
brookfield
witnesses
established
every
offence
alleged
against
oscar
wilde
dated
from
or
later
after
his
first
meeting
with
lord
alfred
douglas
but
at
the
time
all
such
matters
were
lost
for
me
in
the
questions
would
the
authorities
arrest
oscar
or
would
they
allow
him
to
escape
had
the
police
asked
for
a
warrant
knowing
english
custom
and
the
desire
of
englishmen
to
pass
in
silence
over
all
unpleasant
sexual
matters
i
thought
he
would
be
given
the
hint
to
go
abroad
and
allowed
to
escape
that
is
the
ordinary
the
usual
english
procedure
everyone
knows
the
case
of
a
certain
lord
notorious
for
similar
practices
who
was
warned
by
the
police
that
a
warrant
had
been
issued
against
him
taking
the
hint
he
has
lived
for
many
years
past
in
leisured
ease
as
an
honoured
guest
in
florence
nor
is
it
only
aristocrats
who
are
so
favoured
by
english
justice
everyone
can
remember
the
case
of
a
canon
of
westminster
who
was
similarly
warned
and
also
escaped
we
can
come
down
the
social
scale
to
the
very
bottom
and
find
the
same
practice
a
certain
journalist
unwittingly
offended
a
great
personage
immediately
he
was
warned
by
the
police
that
a
warrant
issued
against
him
in
india
seventeen
years
before
would
at
once
be
acted
upon
if
he
did
not
make
himself
scarce
for
some
time
he
lived
in
peaceful
retirement
in
belgium
moreover
in
all
these
cases
the
warrants
had
been
issued
on
the
sworn
complaints
of
the
parties
damnified
or
of
their
parents
and
guardians
no
one
had
complained
of
oscar
wilde
naturally
i
thought
the
dislike
of
publicity
which
dictated
such
lenience
to
the
lord
and
the
canon
and
the
journalist
would
be
even
more
operative
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
genius
like
oscar
wilde
in
certain
ways
he
had
a
greater
position
than
even
the
son
of
a
duke
the
shocking
details
of
his
trial
would
have
an
appalling
a
publicity
besides
i
said
to
myself
the
governing
class
in
england
is
steeped
in
aristocratic
prejudice
and
particularly
when
threatened
by
democratic
innovations
all
superiorities
whether
of
birth
or
wealth
or
talent
are
conscious
of
the
same
raison
and
have
the
same
the
lord
the
millionaire
and
the
genius
have
all
the
same
reason
for
standing
up
for
each
other
and
this
reason
is
usually
effective
everyone
knows
that
in
england
the
law
is
emphatically
a
respecter
of
persons
it
is
not
there
to
promote
equality
much
less
is
it
the
defender
of
the
helpless
the
weak
and
the
poor
it
is
a
rampart
for
the
aristocracy
and
the
rich
a
whip
in
the
hands
of
the
strong
it
is
always
used
to
increase
the
effect
of
natural
and
inherited
inequality
and
it
is
not
directed
by
a
high
feeling
of
justice
but
perverted
by
aristocratic
prejudice
and
snobbishness
it
is
not
higher
than
democratic
equality
but
lower
and
more
sordid
the
case
was
just
a
case
where
an
aristocratic
society
could
and
should
have
shown
its
superiority
over
a
democratic
society
with
its
rough
rule
of
equality
for
equality
is
only
on
the
road
to
justice
more
than
once
the
house
of
commons
has
recognised
this
fundamental
truth
it
condemned
clive
but
added
that
he
had
rendered
great
and
distinguished
services
to
his
country
and
no
one
thought
of
punishing
him
for
his
crimes
our
time
is
even
more
tolerant
and
more
corrupt
for
a
worse
crime
than
extortion
cecil
rhodes
was
not
even
brought
to
trial
but
honoured
and
feted
while
his
creatures
who
were
condemned
by
the
house
of
commons
committee
were
rewarded
by
the
government
had
not
wilde
also
rendered
distinguished
services
to
his
country
the
wars
waged
against
the
mashonas
and
matabeles
were
a
doubtful
good
but
the
plays
of
oscar
wilde
had
already
given
many
hours
of
innocent
pleasure
to
thousands
of
persons
and
were
evidently
destined
to
benefit
tens
of
thousands
in
the
future
such
a
man
is
a
benefactor
of
humanity
in
the
best
and
truest
sense
and
deserves
peculiar
consideration
to
the
society
favourite
the
discredit
of
the
trial
with
lord
queensberry
was
in
itself
a
punishment
more
than
sufficient
everyone
knew
when
oscar
wilde
left
the
court
that
he
left
it
a
ruined
and
disgraced
man
was
it
worth
while
to
stir
up
all
the
foul
mud
again
in
order
to
beat
the
beaten
alas
the
english
are
pedants
as
goethe
saw
they
think
little
of
literary
men
or
of
merely
spiritual
achievements
they
love
to
abide
by
rules
and
pay
no
heed
to
exceptions
unless
indeed
the
exceptions
are
men
of
title
or
great
wealth
or
persons
of
importance
to
the
government
the
majority
of
the
people
are
too
ignorant
to
know
the
value
of
a
book
and
they
regard
poetry
as
the
thistledown
of
speech
it
does
not
occur
to
englishmen
that
a
phrase
may
be
more
valuable
and
more
enduring
in
its
effects
than
a
long
campaign
and
a
dozen
victories
yet
the
sentence
let
him
that
is
without
sin
among
you
first
cast
the
stone
or
shakespeare
version
of
the
same
truth
if
we
had
our
deserts
which
of
us
would
escape
whipping
is
likely
to
outlast
the
british
empire
and
prove
of
more
value
to
humanity
the
man
of
genius
in
great
britain
is
feared
and
hated
in
exact
proportion
to
his
originality
and
if
he
happens
to
be
a
writer
or
a
musician
he
is
despised
to
boot
the
prejudice
against
oscar
wilde
showed
itself
virulently
on
all
hands
justice
collins
did
not
attempt
to
restrain
the
cheering
of
the
court
that
greeted
the
success
of
lord
queensberry
not
one
of
the
policemen
who
stood
round
the
door
tried
to
stop
the
booing
of
the
crowd
who
pursued
oscar
wilde
with
hootings
and
vile
cries
when
he
left
the
court
he
was
judged
already
and
condemned
before
being
tried
the
police
too
acted
against
him
with
extraordinary
vigour
it
has
been
stated
by
sherard
in
his
life
that
the
police
did
not
attempt
to
execute
the
warrant
against
wilde
till
after
the
last
train
had
left
for
dover
and
that
it
was
only
oscar
obstinacy
in
remaining
in
london
that
necessitated
his
arrest
this
idea
is
wholly
imaginary
it
is
worth
while
to
know
exactly
what
took
place
at
this
juncture
from
oscar
conduct
in
this
crisis
the
reader
will
be
able
to
judge
whether
he
has
been
depicted
faithfully
or
not
in
this
book
he
has
been
described
as
amiable
weak
of
a
charming
disposition
easily
led
in
action
though
not
in
thought
now
we
shall
see
how
far
we
were
justified
for
he
is
at
one
of
those
moments
which
try
the
soul
fortunately
every
incident
of
that
day
is
known
oscar
himself
told
me
generally
what
happened
and
the
minutest
details
of
the
picture
were
filled
in
for
me
a
little
later
by
his
best
friend
robert
ross
in
the
morning
mathews
one
of
oscar
counsel
came
to
him
and
said
if
you
wish
it
clarke
and
i
will
keep
the
case
going
and
give
you
time
to
get
to
calais
oscar
refused
to
stir
i
stay
was
all
he
would
say
robert
ross
urged
him
to
accept
mathew
offer
but
he
would
not
why
i
am
sure
he
had
no
reason
for
i
put
the
question
to
him
more
than
once
and
even
after
reflecting
he
had
no
explanation
to
give
he
stayed
because
to
stay
was
easier
than
to
make
an
immediate
decision
and
act
on
it
energetically
he
had
very
little
will
power
to
begin
with
and
his
mode
of
life
had
weakened
his
original
endowment
after
the
judgment
had
been
given
in
favour
of
queensberry
oscar
drove
off
in
a
brougham
accompanied
by
alfred
douglas
to
consult
with
his
solicitor
humphreys
at
the
same
time
he
gave
ross
a
cheque
on
his
bank
in
street
at
that
moment
he
intended
to
fly
ross
noticed
that
he
was
followed
by
a
detective
he
drew
about
from
the
bank
and
raced
off
to
meet
oscar
at
the
cadogan
hotel
in
sloane
street
where
lord
alfred
douglas
had
been
staying
for
the
past
four
or
five
weeks
ross
reached
the
cadogan
hotel
about
and
found
oscar
there
with
reggie
turner
both
of
them
advised
oscar
to
go
at
once
to
dover
and
try
to
get
to
france
but
he
would
only
say
the
train
has
gone
it
is
too
late
he
had
again
lapsed
into
inaction
he
asked
ross
to
go
to
see
his
wife
and
tell
her
what
had
occurred
ross
did
this
and
had
a
very
painful
scene
wilde
wept
and
said
i
hope
oscar
is
going
away
abroad
ross
returned
to
the
cadogan
hotel
and
told
oscar
what
his
wife
had
said
but
even
this
did
move
him
to
action
he
sat
as
if
glued
to
his
chair
and
drank
hock
and
seltzer
steadily
in
almost
unbroken
silence
about
four
george
wyndham
came
to
see
his
cousin
alfred
douglas
not
finding
him
he
wanted
to
see
oscar
but
oscar
fearing
reproaches
sent
ross
instead
wyndham
said
it
was
a
pity
that
bosie
douglas
should
be
with
oscar
and
ross
immediately
told
him
that
wilde
friends
for
years
past
had
been
trying
to
separate
them
and
that
if
he
wyndham
would
keep
his
cousin
away
he
would
be
doing
oscar
the
very
greatest
kindness
at
this
wyndham
grew
more
civil
though
still
frightfully
agitated
and
begged
ross
to
get
oscar
to
leave
the
country
at
once
to
avoid
scandal
ross
replied
that
he
and
turner
had
been
trying
to
bring
that
about
for
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
bosie
having
returned
burst
into
the
room
with
i
want
to
see
my
cousin
and
ross
rejoined
oscar
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
bosie
followed
him
to
say
that
he
was
going
out
with
wyndham
to
see
someone
of
importance
about
five
a
reporter
of
the
star
newspaper
came
to
see
oscar
a
marlowe
who
is
now
editor
of
the
daily
mail
but
again
oscar
refused
to
see
him
and
sent
ross
marlowe
was
sympathetic
and
quite
understood
the
position
he
informed
ross
that
a
tape
message
had
come
through
to
the
paper
saying
that
a
warrant
for
oscar
wilde
had
already
been
issued
ross
immediately
went
into
the
other
room
and
told
oscar
who
said
nothing
but
went
very
grey
in
the
face
a
moment
later
oscar
asked
ross
to
give
him
the
money
he
had
got
at
the
bank
though
he
had
refused
it
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
ross
gave
it
to
him
naturally
taking
it
for
a
sign
that
he
had
at
length
made
up
his
mind
to
start
but
immediately
afterwards
oscar
settled
down
in
his
chair
and
said
i
shall
stay
and
do
my
sentence
whatever
it
is
a
man
evidently
incapable
of
action
for
the
next
hour
the
trio
sat
waiting
for
the
blow
to
fall
once
or
twice
oscar
asked
querulously
where
bosie
was
but
no
one
could
tell
him
at
ten
past
six
the
waiter
knocked
at
the
door
and
ross
answered
it
there
were
two
detectives
the
elder
entered
and
said
we
have
a
warrant
here
wilde
for
your
arrest
on
a
charge
of
committing
indecent
acts
wilde
wanted
to
know
whether
he
would
be
given
bail
the
detective
replied
that
is
a
question
for
the
magistrate
oscar
then
rose
and
asked
where
shall
i
be
taken
to
bow
street
was
the
reply
as
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
yellow
book
and
groped
for
his
overcoat
they
all
noticed
that
he
was
very
drunk
though
still
perfectly
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
asked
ross
to
go
to
tite
street
and
get
him
a
change
of
clothes
and
bring
them
to
bow
street
the
two
detectives
took
him
away
in
a
leaving
ross
and
turner
on
the
curb
ross
hurried
to
tite
street
he
found
that
oscar
wilde
had
gone
to
the
house
of
a
relative
and
there
was
only
wilde
man
servant
arthur
in
the
house
who
afterwards
went
out
of
his
mind
and
is
still
it
is
said
in
an
asylum
he
had
an
intense
affection
for
oscar
ross
found
that
oscar
wilde
had
locked
up
oscar
bedroom
and
study
he
burst
open
the
bedroom
door
and
with
the
help
of
arthur
packed
up
a
change
of
things
he
then
hurried
to
bow
street
where
he
found
a
howling
mob
shouting
indecencies
he
was
informed
by
an
inspector
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
wilde
or
to
leave
any
clothes
for
him
ross
returned
at
once
to
tite
street
forced
open
the
library
door
and
removed
a
certain
number
of
letters
and
manuscripts
of
wilde
but
unluckily
he
could
find
the
two
mss
which
he
knew
had
been
returned
to
tite
street
two
days
before
namely
a
florentine
tragedy
and
the
enlarged
version
of
the
portrait
of
ross
then
drove
to
his
mother
and
collapsed
ross
insisted
that
he
should
go
abroad
and
in
order
to
induce
him
to
do
it
gave
for
defence
ross
went
to
the
terminus
hotel
at
calais
where
bosie
douglas
joined
him
a
little
later
they
both
stayed
there
while
oscar
was
being
tried
before
justice
charles
and
one
day
george
wyndham
crossed
the
channel
to
see
bosie
douglas
there
is
of
course
some
excuse
to
be
made
for
the
chief
actor
oscar
was
physically
tired
and
morally
broken
he
had
pulled
the
fair
building
of
reputation
and
success
down
upon
his
own
head
and
with
the
booing
of
the
mob
still
in
his
ears
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
lost
hours
when
he
ought
to
have
used
his
money
to
take
him
beyond
the
reach
of
his
pursuers
his
enemies
on
the
other
hand
had
acted
with
the
utmost
promptitude
lord
queensberry
solicitor
charles
russell
had
stated
that
it
was
not
his
client
intention
to
take
the
initiative
in
any
criminal
prosecution
of
oscar
wilde
but
on
the
very
same
morning
when
wilde
withdrew
from
the
prosecution
russell
sent
a
letter
to
the
hon
hamilton
cuffe
the
director
of
public
prosecutions
with
a
copy
of
all
our
witnesses
statements
together
with
a
copy
of
the
shorthand
notes
of
the
trial
the
treasury
authorities
were
at
least
as
eager
as
soon
as
possible
after
leaving
the
court
gill
angus
lewis
and
charles
russell
waited
on
sir
john
bridge
at
bow
street
in
his
private
room
and
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
oscar
wilde
which
was
executed
as
we
have
seen
the
same
evening
the
police
showed
him
less
than
no
favour
about
eight
lord
alfred
douglas
drove
to
bow
street
and
wanted
to
know
if
wilde
could
be
bailed
out
but
was
informed
that
his
application
could
not
be
entertained
he
offered
to
procure
comforts
for
the
prisoner
this
offer
also
was
peremptorily
refused
by
the
police
inspector
just
as
ross
offer
of
night
clothes
had
been
refused
it
is
a
common
belief
that
in
england
a
man
is
treated
as
innocent
until
he
has
been
proved
guilty
but
those
who
believe
this
pleasant
fiction
have
never
been
in
the
hands
of
the
english
police
as
soon
as
a
man
is
arrested
on
any
charge
he
is
at
once
treated
as
if
he
were
a
dangerous
criminal
he
is
searched
for
instance
with
every
circumstance
of
indignity
before
his
conviction
a
man
is
allowed
to
wear
his
own
clothes
but
a
change
of
linen
or
clothes
is
denied
him
or
accorded
in
part
and
grudgingly
for
no
earthly
reason
except
to
gratify
the
of
the
gaolers
the
warrant
on
which
oscar
wilde
was
arrested
charged
him
with
an
offence
alleged
to
have
been
committed
under
section
xi
of
the
criminal
amendment
act
of
in
other
words
he
was
arrested
and
tried
for
an
offence
which
was
not
punishable
by
law
ten
years
before
this
act
was
brought
in
as
a
result
of
the
shameful
and
sentimental
stories
evidently
for
the
most
part
manufactured
which
stead
had
published
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
under
the
title
of
modern
babylon
in
order
to
cover
and
justify
their
prophet
some
of
the
unco
guid
pressed
forward
this
legislative
reform
by
which
it
was
made
a
criminal
offence
to
take
liberties
with
a
girl
under
thirteen
years
of
age
even
with
her
own
consent
intimacy
with
minors
under
sixteen
was
punishable
if
they
consented
or
even
tempted
labouchere
the
radical
member
inflamed
it
is
said
with
a
desire
to
make
the
law
ridiculous
gravely
proposed
that
the
section
be
extended
so
as
to
apply
to
people
of
the
same
sex
who
indulged
in
familiarities
or
indecencies
the
puritan
faction
had
no
logical
objection
to
the
extension
and
it
became
the
law
of
the
land
it
was
by
virtue
of
this
piece
of
legislative
wisdom
which
is
without
a
model
and
without
a
copy
in
the
law
of
any
other
civilised
country
that
oscar
wilde
was
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
his
arrest
was
the
signal
for
an
orgy
of
philistine
rancour
such
as
even
london
had
never
known
before
the
puritan
middle
class
which
had
always
regarded
wilde
with
dislike
as
an
artist
and
intellectual
scoffer
a
mere
parasite
of
the
aristocracy
now
gave
free
scope
to
their
disgust
and
contempt
and
everyone
tried
to
outdo
his
neighbour
in
expressions
of
loathing
and
abhorrence
this
middle
class
condemnation
swept
the
lower
class
away
in
its
train
to
do
them
justice
the
common
people
too
felt
a
natural
loathing
for
the
peculiar
vice
attributed
to
wilde
most
men
condemn
the
sins
they
have
no
mind
to
but
their
dislike
was
rather
contemptuous
than
profound
and
with
customary
humour
they
soon
turned
the
whole
case
into
a
bestial
obscene
joke
oscar
took
the
place
of
their
favourite
word
as
a
term
of
contempt
and
they
shouted
it
at
each
other
on
all
sides
cabbies
and
paper
sellers
using
it
in
and
out
of
season
with
the
keenest
relish
for
the
moment
the
upper
classes
lay
chance
and
let
the
storm
blow
over
some
of
them
of
course
agreed
with
the
condemnation
of
the
puritans
and
many
of
them
felt
that
oscar
and
his
associates
had
been
too
bold
and
ought
to
be
pulled
up
the
english
journals
which
are
nothing
but
shops
took
the
side
of
their
patrons
without
a
single
exception
they
outdid
themselves
in
condemnation
of
the
man
and
all
his
works
you
might
have
thought
to
read
their
bitter
diatribes
that
they
themselves
lived
saintly
lives
and
were
shocked
at
sensual
sin
one
rubbed
one
eyes
in
amazement
the
strand
and
fleet
street
which
practically
belong
to
this
class
and
have
been
fashioned
by
them
are
the
haunt
of
as
vile
a
prostitution
as
can
be
found
in
europe
the
public
houses
which
these
men
frequent
are
low
drinking
dens
yet
they
all
lashed
oscar
wilde
with
every
variety
of
insult
as
if
they
themselves
had
been
above
reproach
the
whole
of
london
seemed
to
have
broken
loose
in
a
rage
of
contempt
and
loathing
which
was
whipped
up
and
justified
each
morning
by
the
hypocritical
articles
of
the
unco
guid
in
the
daily
this
and
the
weekly
that
in
the
streets
one
heard
everywhere
the
loud
jests
of
the
vulgar
decked
out
with
filthy
anecdotes
and
punctuated
by
obscene
laughter
as
from
the
mouth
of
the
pit
in
spite
of
the
hatred
of
the
journalists
pandering
to
the
prejudice
of
their
paymasters
one
could
hope
still
that
the
magistrate
would
show
some
regard
for
fair
play
the
expectation
reasonable
or
unreasonable
was
doomed
to
disappointment
on
saturday
morning
the
oscar
wilde
described
as
a
gentleman
the
papers
said
in
derision
was
brought
before
sir
john
bridge
gill
who
had
been
employed
in
the
queensberry
trial
was
instructed
by
angus
lewis
of
the
treasury
and
conducted
the
prosecution
alfred
taylor
was
placed
in
the
dock
charged
with
conspiracy
with
oscar
wilde
the
witnesses
have
already
been
described
in
connection
with
the
queensberry
case
charles
parker
william
parker
alfred
wood
sidney
mavor
and
shelley
all
gave
evidence
after
lasting
all
day
the
case
was
adjourned
till
the
following
thursday
travers
humphreys
applied
for
bail
for
wilde
on
the
ground
that
he
knew
the
warrant
against
him
was
being
applied
for
on
friday
afternoon
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
leave
london
sir
john
bridge
refused
bail
on
thursday
the
the
case
was
continued
before
sir
john
bridge
and
in
the
end
both
the
accused
were
committed
for
trial
again
humphreys
applied
for
bail
and
again
the
magistrate
refused
to
accept
bail
now
to
refuse
bail
in
cases
of
serious
crime
may
be
defended
but
in
the
case
of
indecent
conduct
it
is
usually
granted
to
run
away
is
regarded
as
a
confession
of
guilt
and
what
could
one
wish
for
more
than
the
perpetual
banishment
of
the
corrupt
liver
consequently
there
is
no
reason
to
refuse
bail
but
in
this
case
though
bail
was
offered
to
any
amount
it
was
refused
peremptorily
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
every
consideration
should
have
been
shown
to
an
accused
person
who
had
already
had
a
good
opportunity
to
leave
the
country
and
had
refused
to
budge
moreover
oscar
wilde
had
already
been
criticised
and
condemned
in
a
hundred
papers
there
was
widespread
prejudice
against
him
no
risk
to
the
public
in
accepting
bail
and
considerable
injury
done
to
the
accused
in
refusing
it
his
affairs
were
certain
to
be
thrown
into
confusion
he
was
known
not
to
be
rich
and
yet
he
was
deprived
of
the
power
to
get
money
together
and
to
collect
evidence
just
when
the
power
which
freedom
confers
was
most
needed
by
him
the
magistrate
was
as
prejudiced
as
the
public
he
had
no
more
idea
of
standing
for
justice
and
fair
play
than
pilate
probably
indeed
he
never
gave
himself
the
trouble
to
think
of
fairness
in
the
matter
a
large
salary
is
paid
to
magistrates
in
london
a
year
but
it
is
rare
indeed
that
any
of
them
rises
above
the
vulgarest
prejudice
sir
john
bridge
not
only
refused
bail
but
he
was
careful
to
give
his
reasons
for
refusing
it
he
had
not
the
slightest
scruple
about
prejudicing
the
case
even
before
he
had
heard
a
word
of
the
defence
after
hearing
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
he
said
the
responsibility
of
accepting
or
refusing
bail
rests
upon
me
the
considerations
that
weigh
with
me
are
the
gravity
of
the
offences
and
the
strength
of
the
evidence
i
must
absolutely
refuse
bail
and
send
the
prisoners
for
trial
now
these
reasons
which
he
proffered
voluntarily
and
especially
the
use
of
the
word
absolutely
showed
not
only
prejudice
on
the
part
of
sir
john
bridge
but
the
desire
to
injure
the
unfortunate
prisoner
in
the
public
mind
and
so
continue
the
evil
work
of
the
journalists
the
effect
of
this
prejudice
and
rancour
on
the
part
of
the
whole
community
had
various
consequences
the
mere
news
that
oscar
wilde
had
been
arrested
and
taken
to
holloway
startled
london
and
gave
the
signal
for
a
strange
exodus
every
train
to
dover
was
crowded
every
steamer
to
calais
thronged
with
members
of
the
aristocratic
and
leisured
classes
who
seemed
to
prefer
paris
or
even
nice
out
of
the
season
to
a
city
like
london
where
the
police
might
act
with
such
unexpected
vigour
the
truth
was
that
the
cultured
aesthetes
whom
i
have
already
described
had
been
thunderstruck
by
the
facts
which
the
queensberry
trial
had
laid
bare
for
the
first
time
they
learned
that
such
houses
as
taylor
were
under
police
supervision
and
that
creatures
like
wood
and
parker
were
classified
and
watched
they
had
imagined
that
in
the
home
of
liberty
such
practices
passed
unnoticed
it
came
as
a
shock
to
their
preconceived
ideas
that
the
police
in
london
knew
a
great
many
things
which
they
were
not
supposed
to
concern
themselves
with
and
this
unwelcome
glare
of
light
drove
the
vicious
forth
in
wild
haste
never
was
paris
so
crowded
with
members
of
the
english
governing
classes
here
was
to
be
seen
a
famous
there
the
fine
face
of
the
president
of
a
royal
society
at
one
table
in
the
cafe
de
la
paix
a
millionaire
recently
ennobled
and
celebrated
for
his
exquisite
taste
in
art
opposite
to
him
a
famous
general
it
was
even
said
that
a
celebrated
english
actor
took
a
return
ticket
for
three
or
four
days
to
paris
just
to
be
in
the
fashion
the
mummer
returned
quickly
but
the
majority
of
the
migrants
stayed
abroad
for
some
time
the
wind
of
terror
which
had
swept
them
across
the
channel
opposed
their
return
and
they
scattered
over
the
continent
from
naples
to
monte
carlo
and
from
palermo
to
seville
under
all
sorts
of
pretexts
the
gravest
result
of
the
magistrate
refusal
to
accept
bail
was
purely
personal
oscar
income
dried
up
at
the
source
his
books
were
withdrawn
from
sale
no
one
went
to
see
his
plays
every
shop
keeper
to
whom
he
owed
a
penny
took
immediate
action
against
him
judgments
were
obtained
and
an
execution
put
into
his
house
in
tite
street
within
a
month
at
the
very
moment
when
he
most
needed
money
to
fee
counsel
and
procure
evidence
he
was
beggared
and
sold
up
and
because
of
his
confinement
in
prison
the
sale
was
conducted
under
such
conditions
that
whereas
in
ordinary
times
his
effects
would
have
covered
the
claims
against
him
three
times
over
all
his
belongings
went
for
nothing
and
the
man
who
was
making
or
a
year
by
his
plays
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt
for
a
little
over
of
this
sum
were
for
lord
costs
which
the
queensberry
family
lord
douglas
of
hawick
lord
alfred
douglas
and
their
mother
had
promised
in
writing
to
pay
but
when
the
time
came
absolutely
refused
to
pay
most
unfortunately
many
of
oscar
mss
were
stolen
or
lost
in
the
disorder
of
the
sheriff
legal
proceedings
wilde
could
have
cried
with
shylock
you
take
my
life
when
you
do
take
away
the
means
whereby
i
live
but
at
the
time
nine
englishmen
out
of
ten
applauded
what
was
practically
persecution
a
worse
thing
remains
to
be
told
the
right
of
free
speech
which
englishmen
pride
themselves
on
had
utterly
disappeared
as
it
always
does
disappear
in
england
when
there
is
most
need
of
it
it
was
impossible
to
say
one
word
in
wilde
defence
or
even
in
extenuation
of
his
sin
in
any
london
print
at
this
time
i
owned
the
greater
part
of
the
saturday
review
and
edited
it
here
at
any
rate
one
might
have
thought
i
could
have
set
forth
in
a
christian
country
a
sane
and
liberal
view
i
had
no
wish
to
minimise
the
offence
no
one
condemned
unnatural
vice
more
than
i
but
oscar
wilde
was
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
he
had
written
beautiful
things
and
his
good
works
should
have
been
allowed
to
speak
in
his
favour
i
wrote
an
article
setting
forth
this
view
my
printers
immediately
informed
me
that
they
thought
the
article
and
when
i
insisted
they
said
they
would
prefer
not
to
print
it
yet
there
was
nothing
in
it
beyond
a
plea
to
suspend
judgment
and
defer
insult
till
after
the
trial
smith
and
sons
the
great
booksellers
who
somehow
got
wind
of
the
matter
through
my
publisher
i
believe
sent
to
say
that
they
would
not
sell
any
paper
that
attempted
to
defend
oscar
wilde
it
would
be
better
even
they
added
not
to
mention
his
name
the
english
were
determined
that
this
man
should
have
jedburg
justice
i
should
have
ruined
the
saturday
review
by
the
mere
attempt
to
treat
the
matter
fairly
in
this
extremity
i
went
to
the
great
leader
of
public
opinion
in
england
arthur
walter
the
manager
of
the
times
had
always
been
kind
to
me
he
was
a
man
of
balanced
mind
who
had
taken
high
honours
at
oxford
in
his
youth
and
for
twenty
years
had
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
leading
men
in
every
rank
of
life
i
went
down
to
stay
with
him
in
berkshire
and
i
urged
upon
him
what
i
regarded
as
the
aristocratic
view
in
england
it
was
manifest
that
under
the
circumstances
there
was
no
chance
of
a
fair
trial
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
duty
of
the
times
to
say
plainly
that
this
man
should
not
be
condemned
beforehand
and
that
if
he
were
condemned
his
merits
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
his
punishment
as
well
as
his
demerits
while
willing
to
listen
to
me
walter
did
not
share
my
views
a
man
who
had
written
a
great
poem
or
a
great
play
did
not
rank
in
his
esteem
with
a
man
who
had
won
a
skirmish
against
a
handful
of
unarmed
savages
or
one
who
had
stolen
a
piece
of
land
from
some
barbarians
and
annexed
it
to
the
empire
in
his
heart
he
held
the
view
of
the
english
landed
aristocracy
that
the
ordinary
successful
general
or
admiral
or
statesman
was
infinitely
more
important
than
a
shakespeare
or
a
browning
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
believe
that
the
names
of
gladstone
disraeli
wolseley
roberts
and
wood
would
diminish
and
fade
from
day
to
day
till
in
a
hundred
years
they
would
scarcely
be
known
even
to
the
educated
whereas
the
fame
of
browning
swinburne
meredith
or
even
oscar
wilde
would
increase
and
grow
brighter
with
time
till
in
one
hundred
or
five
hundred
years
no
one
would
dream
of
comparing
pushful
politicians
like
gladstone
or
beaconsfield
with
men
of
genius
like
swinburne
or
wilde
he
simply
would
not
see
it
and
when
he
perceived
that
the
weight
of
argument
was
against
him
he
declared
that
if
it
were
true
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
humanity
in
his
opinion
anyone
living
a
clean
life
was
worth
more
than
a
writer
of
love
songs
or
the
maker
of
clever
comedies
john
smith
worth
more
than
shakespeare
he
was
as
deaf
as
only
englishmen
can
be
deaf
to
the
plea
for
abstract
justice
you
do
even
say
wilde
innocent
he
threw
at
me
more
than
once
i
believe
him
to
be
innocent
i
declared
truthfully
but
it
is
better
that
a
hundred
guilty
men
go
free
than
that
one
man
should
not
have
a
fair
trial
and
how
can
this
man
have
a
fair
trial
now
when
the
papers
for
weeks
past
have
been
filled
with
violent
diatribes
against
him
and
his
works
one
point
peculiarly
english
he
used
again
and
again
so
long
as
substantial
justice
is
done
he
said
it
is
all
we
care
about
substantial
justice
will
never
be
done
i
cried
so
long
as
that
is
your
ideal
your
arrow
can
never
go
quite
so
high
as
it
is
aimed
but
i
got
no
further
if
oscar
wilde
had
been
a
general
or
a
empire
builder
the
times
might
have
affronted
public
opinion
and
called
attention
to
his
virtues
and
argued
that
they
should
be
taken
in
extenuation
of
his
offences
but
as
he
was
only
a
writer
no
one
seemed
to
owe
him
anything
or
to
care
what
became
of
him
walter
was
in
comparison
with
most
men
of
his
class
there
was
staying
with
him
at
this
very
time
an
irish
gentleman
who
listened
to
my
pleading
for
wilde
with
indignation
excited
by
arthur
obstinacy
to
find
fresh
arguments
i
pointed
out
that
wilde
offence
was
pathological
and
not
criminal
and
would
not
be
punished
in
a
properly
constituted
state
you
admit
i
said
that
we
punish
crime
to
prevent
it
spreading
wipe
this
sin
off
the
statute
book
and
you
would
not
increase
the
sinners
by
one
then
why
punish
them
oi
whip
such
sinners
to
death
so
i
would
cried
the
irishman
too
good
for
them
you
only
punished
lepers
i
went
on
in
the
middle
ages
because
you
believed
that
leprosy
was
catching
this
malady
is
not
even
catching
faith
oi
punish
it
with
extermination
cried
the
irishman
exasperated
by
the
fact
that
his
idiot
prejudice
was
hurting
my
friend
i
said
at
length
with
a
smile
you
are
very
bitter
i
not
you
see
i
have
no
sexual
jealousy
to
inflame
me
on
this
walter
had
to
interfere
between
us
to
keep
the
peace
but
the
mischief
was
done
my
advocacy
remained
without
effect
it
is
very
curious
how
and
enduring
is
the
prejudice
against
writers
in
england
not
only
is
no
attempt
made
to
rate
them
at
their
true
value
at
the
value
which
posterity
puts
upon
their
work
but
they
are
continually
treated
as
outcasts
and
denied
the
most
ordinary
justice
the
various
trials
of
oscar
wilde
are
to
the
thinker
an
object
lesson
in
the
force
of
this
prejudice
but
some
may
explain
the
prejudice
against
wilde
on
the
score
of
the
peculiar
abhorrence
with
which
the
offence
ascribed
to
him
is
regarded
in
england
let
me
take
an
example
from
the
papers
of
today
i
am
writing
in
january
i
find
in
my
daily
mail
that
at
bow
street
police
court
a
london
magistrate
sir
albert
de
rutzen
ordered
the
destruction
of
volumes
of
the
english
translation
of
balzac
les
contes
drolatiques
on
the
ground
that
the
book
was
obscene
les
contes
drolatiques
is
an
acknowledged
masterpiece
and
is
not
nearly
so
free
spoken
as
lear
or
hamlet
or
tom
jones
or
anthony
and
cleopatra
what
would
be
thought
of
a
french
magistrate
or
a
german
magistrate
who
ordered
a
fair
translation
of
hamlet
or
of
lear
to
be
burnt
because
of
its
obscenity
he
would
be
regarded
as
demented
one
can
only
understand
such
a
judgment
as
an
isolated
fact
but
in
england
this
monstrous
stupidity
is
the
rule
sir
de
rutzen
was
not
satisfied
with
ordering
the
books
to
be
burnt
and
fining
the
bookseller
he
went
on
to
justify
his
condemnation
and
praise
the
police
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
my
mind
that
a
more
foul
and
filthy
black
spot
has
not
been
found
in
london
for
a
long
time
and
the
police
have
done
uncommonly
well
in
bringing
the
matter
to
light
i
consider
that
the
books
are
likely
to
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
fancy
the
state
of
mind
of
the
man
who
can
talk
such
poisonous
nonsense
who
with
the
knowledge
of
what
piccadilly
is
at
night
in
his
mind
can
speak
of
the
translation
of
a
masterpiece
as
one
of
the
most
filthy
black
spots
to
be
found
in
london
to
say
that
such
a
man
is
insane
is
i
suppose
going
too
far
but
to
say
that
he
does
not
know
the
value
or
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
uses
to
say
that
he
is
driven
by
an
extraordinary
and
brainless
prejudice
is
certainly
the
modesty
of
truth
it
is
this
sort
of
perversity
on
the
part
of
sir
de
rutzen
and
of
nine
out
of
ten
englishmen
that
makes
frenchmen
germans
and
italians
speak
of
them
as
ingrained
hypocrites
but
they
are
not
nearly
so
hypocritical
as
they
are
uneducated
and
unintelligent
rebellious
to
the
humanising
influence
of
art
and
literature
the
ordinary
englishman
would
much
prefer
to
be
called
an
athlete
than
a
poet
the
puritan
commonwealth
parliament
ordered
the
pictures
of
charles
to
be
sold
but
such
of
them
as
were
indecent
to
be
burnt
accordingly
half
a
dozen
titians
were
solemnly
burnt
and
the
nucleus
of
a
great
national
gallery
destroyed
one
can
see
sir
de
rutzen
solemnly
assisting
at
this
holocaust
and
devoutly
deciding
that
all
the
masterpieces
which
showed
temptingly
a
woman
beautiful
breasts
were
foul
and
filthy
black
spots
and
must
be
burnt
as
harmful
or
rather
one
can
see
that
sir
de
rutzen
has
in
two
and
a
half
centuries
managed
to
get
a
little
beyond
this
primitive
puritan
standpoint
he
might
allow
a
pictorial
masterpiece
to
pass
unburnt
but
a
written
masterpiece
is
still
to
him
anathema
a
part
of
this
prejudice
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
english
have
a
special
dislike
for
every
form
of
sexual
indulgence
it
is
not
consistent
with
their
ideal
of
manhood
and
like
the
poor
foolish
magistrate
they
have
not
yet
grasped
the
truth
which
one
might
have
thought
the
example
of
the
japanese
would
have
made
plain
by
now
to
the
dullest
that
a
nation
may
be
extraordinarily
brave
vigorous
and
and
at
the
same
time
intensely
sensuous
and
sensitive
to
every
refinement
of
passion
if
the
great
english
middle
class
were
as
well
educated
as
the
german
middle
class
such
a
judgment
as
this
of
sir
de
rutzen
would
be
scouted
as
ridiculous
and
absurd
or
rather
would
be
utterly
unthinkable
in
countries
both
the
artist
and
the
sexual
passion
are
under
a
ban
the
race
is
more
easily
moved
martially
than
amorously
and
it
regards
its
overpowering
combative
instincts
as
virtuous
just
as
it
is
apt
to
despise
what
it
likes
to
call
languishing
love
the
poet
middleton
could
put
his
dream
city
in
england
a
city
of
fair
skies
and
fairer
streets
and
joy
was
there
in
all
the
city
length
i
saw
no
fingers
trembling
for
the
sword
nathless
they
doted
on
their
bodies
strength
that
they
might
gentler
be
love
was
their
lord
both
america
and
england
today
offer
terrifying
examples
of
the
despotism
of
an
unenlightened
and
vulgar
public
opinion
in
all
the
highest
concerns
of
man
in
art
in
literature
and
in
religion
there
is
no
despotism
on
earth
so
destroying
to
the
artist
it
is
baser
and
more
degrading
than
anything
known
in
russia
the
consequences
of
this
tyranny
of
an
uneducated
middle
class
and
a
barbarian
aristocracy
are
shown
in
detail
in
the
trial
of
oscar
wilde
and
in
the
savagery
with
which
he
was
treated
by
the
english
officers
of
justice
chapter
xv
the
queen
wilde
the
first
trial
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
oscar
wilde
was
arrested
and
bail
refused
i
tried
to
get
permission
to
visit
him
in
holloway
i
was
told
i
should
have
to
see
him
in
a
kind
of
barred
cage
and
talk
to
him
from
the
distance
of
at
least
a
yard
it
seemed
to
me
too
painful
for
both
of
us
so
i
went
to
the
higher
authorities
and
got
permission
to
see
him
in
a
private
room
the
governor
met
me
at
the
entrance
of
the
prison
to
my
surprise
he
was
more
than
courteous
charmingly
kind
and
sympathetic
we
all
hope
he
said
that
he
will
soon
be
free
this
is
no
place
for
him
everyone
likes
him
everyone
it
is
a
great
pity
he
evidently
felt
much
more
than
he
said
and
my
heart
went
out
to
him
he
left
me
in
a
bare
room
furnished
with
a
small
square
deal
table
and
two
kitchen
chairs
in
a
moment
or
two
oscar
came
in
accompanied
by
a
warder
in
silence
we
clasped
hands
he
looked
miserably
anxious
and
pulled
down
and
i
felt
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
cheer
him
up
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
cried
i
hope
the
warders
are
kind
to
you
yes
frank
he
replied
in
a
hopeless
way
but
everyone
else
is
against
me
it
is
hard
do
harbour
that
thought
i
answered
many
whom
you
do
know
and
whom
you
will
never
know
are
on
your
side
stand
for
them
and
for
the
myriads
who
are
coming
afterwards
and
make
a
fight
of
it
i
afraid
i
not
a
fighter
frank
as
you
once
said
he
replied
sadly
and
they
wo
give
me
bail
how
can
i
get
evidence
or
think
in
this
place
of
torture
fancy
refusing
me
bail
he
went
on
though
i
stayed
in
london
when
i
might
have
gone
abroad
you
should
have
gone
i
cried
in
french
hot
with
indignation
why
did
you
go
the
moment
you
came
out
of
the
court
i
could
think
at
first
he
answered
in
the
same
tongue
i
could
think
at
all
i
was
numbed
your
friends
should
have
thought
of
it
i
insisted
not
knowing
then
that
they
had
done
their
best
at
this
moment
the
warder
who
had
turned
away
towards
the
door
came
back
you
are
not
allowed
sir
to
talk
in
a
foreign
language
he
said
quietly
you
will
understand
we
have
to
obey
the
rules
besides
the
prisoner
must
not
speak
of
this
prison
as
a
place
of
torture
i
ought
to
report
that
i
sorry
the
misery
of
it
all
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
his
gaolers
even
felt
sorry
for
him
i
thanked
the
warder
and
turned
again
to
oscar
do
let
yourself
fear
at
all
i
exclaimed
you
will
have
your
chance
again
and
must
take
it
only
do
lose
heart
and
do
be
witty
next
time
in
court
the
jury
hate
it
they
regard
it
as
intellectual
superiority
and
impudence
treat
all
things
seriously
and
with
grave
dignity
defend
yourself
as
david
would
have
defended
his
love
for
jonathan
make
them
all
listen
to
you
i
would
undertake
to
get
free
with
half
your
talent
even
if
i
were
guilty
a
resolution
not
to
be
beaten
is
always
half
the
battle
make
your
trial
memorable
from
your
entrance
into
the
court
to
the
decision
of
the
jury
use
every
opportunity
and
give
your
real
character
a
chance
to
fight
for
you
i
spoke
with
tears
in
my
eyes
and
rage
in
my
heart
i
will
do
my
best
frank
he
said
despondingly
i
will
do
my
best
if
i
were
out
of
this
place
i
might
think
of
something
but
it
is
dreadful
to
be
here
one
has
to
go
to
bed
by
daylight
and
the
nights
are
interminable
have
you
a
watch
i
cried
they
do
allow
you
to
have
a
watch
in
prison
he
replied
but
why
not
i
asked
in
amazement
i
did
not
know
that
every
rule
in
an
english
prison
is
cunningly
devised
to
annoy
and
degrade
the
unfortunate
prisoner
oscar
lifted
his
hands
hopelessly
one
may
not
smoke
not
even
a
cigarette
and
so
i
can
not
sleep
all
the
past
comes
back
the
golden
hours
the
june
days
in
london
with
the
sunshine
dappling
the
grass
and
the
silken
rustling
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
do
you
remember
wordsworth
speaks
the
wind
in
the
trees
how
i
wish
i
could
hear
it
now
breathe
it
once
again
i
might
get
strength
then
to
fight
is
the
food
good
i
asked
it
all
right
i
get
it
from
outside
the
food
does
matter
it
is
the
smoking
i
miss
the
freedom
the
companionship
my
mind
will
not
act
when
alone
i
can
only
think
of
what
has
been
and
torment
myself
already
i
been
punished
enough
for
the
sins
of
a
lifetime
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
you
want
i
asked
no
frank
he
answered
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
kind
do
think
of
it
i
said
if
i
any
good
send
for
me
at
any
moment
a
word
will
bring
me
they
allow
you
books
do
they
yes
frank
i
wish
you
would
get
the
of
plato
i
said
and
take
a
big
draught
of
that
deathless
smiling
courage
of
socrates
ah
frank
how
much
more
humane
were
the
greeks
they
let
his
friends
see
him
and
talk
to
him
by
the
hour
though
he
was
condemned
to
death
there
were
no
warders
there
to
listen
no
degrading
conditions
quite
true
i
cried
suddenly
realising
how
much
better
oscar
wilde
would
have
been
treated
in
athens
two
thousand
years
ago
our
progress
is
mainly
change
we
do
shed
our
cruelty
even
christ
has
not
been
able
to
humanise
us
he
nodded
his
head
at
first
he
seemed
greatly
distressed
but
i
managed
to
encourage
him
a
little
for
at
the
close
of
the
talk
he
questioned
me
do
you
really
think
i
may
win
frank
of
course
you
win
i
replied
you
must
win
you
must
not
think
of
being
beaten
take
it
that
they
will
not
want
to
convict
you
say
it
to
yourself
in
the
court
do
let
yourself
fear
for
a
moment
your
enemies
are
merely
stupid
unhappy
creatures
crawling
about
for
a
few
miserable
years
between
earth
and
sun
fated
to
die
and
leave
no
trace
no
memory
remember
you
are
fighting
for
all
of
us
for
every
artist
and
thinker
who
is
to
be
born
into
the
english
world
it
is
better
to
win
like
galileo
than
to
be
burnt
like
giordano
bruno
do
let
them
make
another
martyr
use
all
your
brains
and
eloquence
and
charm
do
be
afraid
they
will
not
condemn
you
if
they
know
you
i
have
been
trying
to
think
he
said
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
bear
one
whole
year
of
this
life
it
dreadful
frank
i
had
no
idea
that
prison
was
so
dreadful
the
warder
again
drew
down
his
brows
i
hastened
to
change
the
subject
that
why
you
must
resolve
not
to
have
any
more
of
it
i
said
i
wish
i
had
seen
you
when
you
came
out
of
court
but
i
really
thought
you
did
want
me
you
turned
away
from
me
oh
frank
how
could
i
he
cried
i
should
have
been
so
grateful
to
you
i
very
shortsighted
i
rejoined
and
i
thought
you
did
it
is
our
foolish
little
vanities
which
prevent
us
acting
as
we
should
but
let
me
know
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
if
you
want
me
i
come
at
any
moment
i
said
this
because
the
warder
had
already
given
me
a
sign
he
now
said
time
is
up
once
again
we
clasped
hands
you
must
win
i
said
do
think
of
defeat
even
your
enemies
are
human
convert
them
you
can
do
it
believe
me
and
i
went
with
dread
in
my
heart
and
pity
and
indignation
be
still
be
still
my
soul
it
is
but
for
a
season
let
us
endure
an
hour
and
see
injustice
done
the
governor
met
me
almost
at
the
door
it
is
terrible
i
exclaimed
this
is
no
place
for
him
he
answered
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
here
everyone
likes
him
and
pities
him
the
warders
everyone
anything
i
can
do
to
make
his
stay
tolerable
shall
be
done
we
shook
hands
i
think
there
were
tears
in
both
our
eyes
as
we
parted
this
humane
governor
had
taught
me
that
oscar
gentleness
and
kindness
his
sweetness
of
nature
would
win
all
hearts
if
it
had
time
to
make
itself
known
yet
there
he
was
in
prison
his
face
and
figure
came
before
me
again
and
again
the
unshaven
face
the
frightened
sad
air
the
hopeless
toneless
voice
the
cleanliness
even
of
the
bare
hard
room
was
ugly
the
english
are
foolish
enough
to
degrade
those
they
punish
revolt
was
blazing
in
me
as
i
went
away
i
looked
up
at
the
mediaeval
castellated
gateway
of
the
place
and
thought
how
perfectly
the
architecture
suited
the
spirit
of
the
institution
the
whole
thing
belongs
to
the
middle
ages
and
not
to
our
modern
life
fancy
having
both
prison
and
hospital
side
by
side
indeed
a
hospital
even
in
the
prison
torture
and
lovingkindness
punishment
and
pity
under
the
same
roof
what
a
blank
contradiction
and
stupidity
will
civilisation
never
reach
humane
ideals
will
men
always
punish
most
severely
the
sins
they
do
not
understand
and
which
hold
for
them
no
temptation
did
jesus
suffer
in
vain
oscar
wilde
was
committed
on
the
of
april
a
true
bill
was
found
against
him
by
the
grand
jury
on
the
and
as
the
case
was
put
down
for
trial
at
the
old
bailey
almost
immediately
a
postponement
was
asked
for
till
the
may
sessions
on
the
ground
first
that
the
defence
had
not
had
time
to
prepare
their
case
and
further
that
in
the
state
of
popular
feeling
at
the
moment
wilde
would
not
get
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
justice
charles
who
was
to
try
the
case
heard
the
application
and
refused
it
peremptorily
any
suggestion
that
the
defendant
would
not
have
a
fair
trial
was
groundless
he
declared
yet
he
knew
better
in
his
summing
up
of
the
case
on
may
he
stated
that
for
weeks
it
had
been
impossible
to
open
a
newspaper
without
reading
some
reference
to
the
case
and
when
he
asked
the
jury
not
to
allow
preconceived
opinions
to
weigh
with
them
he
was
admitting
the
truth
that
every
newspaper
reference
was
charged
with
dislike
and
contempt
of
oscar
wilde
a
fair
trial
indeed
the
trial
took
place
at
the
old
bailey
three
days
later
april
before
justice
charles
gill
and
gill
with
horace
avory
appeared
for
the
public
prosecutor
wilde
was
again
defended
by
sir
edward
clarke
charles
mathews
and
travers
humphreys
while
grain
and
paul
taylor
were
counsel
for
the
other
prisoner
the
trial
began
on
a
saturday
and
the
whole
of
the
day
was
taken
up
with
a
legal
argument
i
am
not
going
to
give
the
details
of
the
case
i
shall
only
note
the
chief
features
of
it
and
the
unfairness
which
characterised
it
sir
edward
clarke
pointed
out
that
there
was
one
set
of
charges
under
the
criminal
law
amendment
act
and
another
set
of
charges
of
conspiracy
he
urged
that
the
charges
of
conspiracy
should
be
dropped
under
the
counts
alleging
conspiracy
the
defendants
could
not
be
called
on
as
witnesses
which
put
the
defence
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
end
the
judge
decided
that
there
were
inconveniences
but
he
would
not
accede
to
sir
edward
clarke
request
later
in
the
trial
however
gill
himself
withdrew
the
charges
of
conspiracy
and
the
judge
admitted
explicitly
in
his
summing
up
that
if
he
had
known
the
evidence
which
was
to
be
offered
he
would
not
have
allowed
these
charges
of
conspiracy
to
be
made
by
this
confession
he
apparently
cleared
his
conscience
just
as
pilate
washed
his
hands
but
the
wrong
had
already
been
done
not
only
did
this
charge
of
conspiracy
embarrass
the
defence
but
if
it
had
never
been
made
as
it
should
never
have
been
made
then
sir
edward
clarke
would
have
insisted
and
could
have
insisted
properly
that
the
two
men
should
be
tried
separately
and
wilde
would
not
have
been
discredited
by
being
coupled
with
taylor
whose
character
was
notorious
and
who
had
already
been
in
the
hands
of
the
police
on
a
similar
charge
this
was
not
the
only
instance
of
unfairness
in
the
conduct
of
the
prosecution
the
treasury
put
a
youth
called
atkins
in
the
box
thus
declaring
him
to
be
at
least
a
credible
witness
but
atkins
was
proved
by
sir
edward
clarke
to
have
perjured
himself
in
the
court
in
the
most
barefaced
way
in
fact
the
treasury
witnesses
against
wilde
were
all
blackmailers
and
people
of
the
lowest
character
with
two
exceptions
the
exceptions
were
a
boy
named
mavor
and
a
youth
named
shelley
with
regard
to
mavor
the
judge
admitted
that
no
evidence
had
been
offered
that
he
could
place
before
the
jury
but
in
his
summing
up
he
was
greatly
affected
by
the
evidence
of
shelley
shelley
was
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
a
species
of
religious
mania
justice
charles
gave
great
weight
to
his
testimony
he
invited
the
jury
to
say
that
although
there
was
in
his
correspondence
which
had
been
read
evidence
of
excitability
to
talk
of
him
as
a
young
man
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
was
to
exaggerate
the
effect
of
his
letters
he
went
on
to
ask
with
much
solemnity
why
should
this
young
man
have
invented
a
tale
which
must
have
been
unpleasant
to
him
to
present
from
the
witness
box
in
the
later
trial
before
justice
wills
the
judge
had
to
rule
out
the
evidence
of
shelley
in
toto
because
it
was
wholly
without
corroboration
if
the
case
before
justice
charles
had
not
been
confused
with
the
charges
of
conspiracy
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
too
would
have
ruled
out
the
evidence
of
shelley
and
then
his
summing
up
must
have
been
entirely
in
favour
of
wilde
the
singular
malevolence
of
the
prosecution
also
can
be
estimated
by
their
use
of
the
literary
argument
wilde
had
written
in
a
magazine
called
the
chameleon
the
chameleon
contained
an
immoral
story
with
which
wilde
had
nothing
to
do
and
which
he
had
repudiated
as
offensive
yet
the
prosecution
tried
to
make
him
responsible
in
some
way
for
the
immorality
of
a
writing
which
he
knew
nothing
about
wilde
had
said
two
poems
of
lord
alfred
douglas
were
beautiful
the
prosecution
declared
that
these
poems
were
in
essence
a
defence
of
the
vilest
immorality
but
is
it
not
possible
for
the
most
passionate
poem
even
the
most
vicious
to
be
beautiful
nothing
was
ever
written
more
passionate
than
one
of
the
poems
of
sappho
yet
a
fragment
has
been
selected
out
and
preserved
by
the
admiration
of
a
hundred
generations
of
men
the
prosecution
was
in
the
position
all
the
time
of
one
who
declared
that
a
man
who
praised
a
nude
picture
must
necessarily
be
immoral
such
a
contention
would
be
inconceivable
in
any
other
civilised
country
even
the
judge
was
on
much
the
same
intellectual
level
it
would
not
be
fair
he
admitted
to
condemn
a
poet
or
dramatic
writer
by
his
works
and
he
went
on
it
is
unfortunately
true
that
while
some
of
our
greatest
writers
have
passed
long
years
in
writing
nothing
but
the
most
wholesome
literature
literature
of
the
highest
genius
and
which
anybody
can
read
such
as
the
literature
of
sir
walter
scott
and
charles
dickens
it
is
also
true
that
there
were
other
great
writers
more
especially
in
the
eighteenth
century
perfectly
men
themselves
who
somehow
or
other
have
permitted
themselves
to
pen
volumes
which
it
is
painful
for
persons
of
ordinary
modesty
and
decency
to
read
it
would
have
been
more
honest
and
more
liberal
to
have
brushed
away
the
nonsensical
indictment
in
a
sentence
would
the
treasury
have
put
shakespeare
on
trial
for
hamlet
or
lear
or
would
they
have
condemned
the
writer
of
the
song
of
solomon
for
immorality
or
sent
paul
to
prison
for
his
epistle
to
the
corinthians
prejudice
and
hypocritic
canting
twaddle
from
judge
and
advocate
dragged
their
weary
length
along
for
days
and
days
on
wednesday
sir
edward
clarke
made
his
speech
for
the
defence
he
pointed
out
the
unfairness
of
the
charges
of
conspiracy
which
had
tardily
been
withdrawn
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
the
case
was
the
fact
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
for
conduct
on
the
part
of
certain
sections
of
the
press
which
was
disgraceful
and
which
imperilled
the
administration
of
justice
and
was
in
the
highest
degree
injurious
to
the
client
for
whom
he
was
pleading
nothing
he
concluded
could
be
more
unfair
than
the
way
wilde
had
been
criticised
in
the
press
for
weeks
and
weeks
but
no
judge
interfered
on
his
behalf
sir
edward
clarke
evidently
thought
that
to
prove
unfairness
would
not
even
influence
the
minds
of
the
london
jury
he
was
content
to
repudiate
the
attempt
to
judge
wilde
by
his
books
or
by
an
article
which
he
had
condemned
or
by
poems
which
he
had
not
written
he
laid
stress
on
the
fact
that
wilde
had
himself
brought
the
charge
against
lord
queensberry
which
had
provoked
the
whole
investigation
on
march
wilde
he
said
knew
the
catalogue
of
accusations
and
he
asked
did
the
jury
believe
that
if
he
had
been
guilty
he
would
have
stayed
in
england
and
brought
about
the
first
trial
insane
would
hardly
be
the
word
for
such
conduct
if
wilde
really
had
been
guilty
moreover
before
even
hearing
the
specific
accusations
wilde
had
gone
into
the
witness
box
to
deny
them
clarke
speech
was
a
good
one
but
nothing
out
of
the
common
no
new
arguments
were
used
in
it
not
one
striking
illustration
needless
to
say
the
higher
advocacy
of
sympathy
was
conspicuous
by
its
absence
again
the
interesting
part
of
the
trial
was
the
of
oscar
wilde
gill
examined
him
at
length
on
the
two
poems
which
lord
alfred
douglas
had
contributed
to
the
chameleon
which
wilde
had
called
beautiful
the
first
was
in
praise
of
shame
the
second
was
one
called
two
loves
sir
edward
clarke
interposing
said
that
not
wilde
mr
gill
gill
i
am
not
aware
that
i
said
it
was
sir
edward
clarke
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
say
it
was
not
gill
insisted
that
wilde
should
explain
the
poem
in
praise
of
shame
wilde
said
that
the
first
poem
seemed
obscure
but
when
pressed
as
to
the
love
described
in
the
second
poem
he
let
himself
go
for
the
first
time
and
perhaps
the
only
time
during
the
trial
he
said
the
that
dare
not
speak
its
name
in
this
century
is
such
a
great
affection
of
an
older
for
a
younger
man
as
there
was
between
david
and
jonathan
such
as
plato
made
the
very
base
of
his
philosophy
and
such
as
you
find
in
the
sonnets
of
michaelangelo
and
shakespeare
a
deep
spiritual
affection
that
is
as
pure
as
it
is
perfect
and
dictates
great
works
of
art
like
those
of
shakespeare
and
michaelangelo
and
those
two
letters
of
mine
such
as
they
are
and
which
is
in
this
century
misunderstood
so
misunderstood
that
on
account
of
it
i
am
placed
where
i
am
now
it
is
beautiful
it
is
fine
it
is
the
noblest
form
of
affection
it
is
intellectual
and
it
repeatedly
exists
between
an
elder
and
younger
man
when
the
elder
man
has
intellect
and
the
younger
man
has
all
the
joy
hope
and
glamour
of
life
that
it
should
be
so
the
world
does
not
understand
it
mocks
at
it
and
sometimes
puts
one
into
the
pillory
for
it
at
this
stage
there
was
loud
applause
in
the
gallery
of
the
court
and
the
learned
judge
at
once
said
i
shall
have
the
court
cleared
if
there
is
the
slightest
manifestation
of
feeling
there
must
be
complete
silence
preserved
justice
charles
repressed
the
cheering
in
favour
of
oscar
wilde
with
great
severity
though
justice
collins
did
not
attempt
to
restrain
the
cheering
which
filled
his
court
and
accompanied
the
dispersing
crowd
into
the
street
on
the
acquittal
of
lord
queensberry
in
spite
however
of
the
unfair
criticisms
of
the
press
in
spite
of
the
unfair
conduct
of
the
prosecution
and
in
spite
of
the
manifest
prejudice
and
philistine
ignorance
of
the
judge
the
jury
disagreed
then
followed
the
most
dramatic
incident
of
the
whole
trial
once
more
sir
edward
clarke
applied
for
bail
on
behalf
of
oscar
wilde
after
what
has
happened
he
said
i
do
not
think
the
crown
will
make
any
objection
to
this
application
the
crown
left
the
matter
to
the
judge
no
doubt
in
all
security
for
the
judge
immediately
refused
the
application
sir
edward
clarke
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
a
it
ought
not
to
take
place
immediately
he
continued
the
burden
of
those
engaged
in
the
case
is
very
heavy
and
i
think
it
only
right
that
the
treasury
should
have
an
opportunity
between
this
and
another
session
of
considering
the
mode
in
which
the
case
should
be
presented
if
indeed
it
is
presented
at
all
gill
immediately
rose
to
the
challenge
the
case
will
certainly
be
tried
again
he
declared
whether
it
is
to
be
tried
again
at
once
or
in
the
next
sessions
will
be
a
matter
of
convenience
probably
the
most
desirable
course
will
be
for
the
case
to
go
to
the
next
sessions
that
is
the
usual
course
justice
charles
if
that
is
the
usual
course
let
it
be
so
the
next
session
of
the
central
criminal
court
opened
on
the
of
the
same
month
not
three
weeks
respite
still
it
might
be
enough
it
was
inconceivable
that
a
judge
in
chambers
would
refuse
to
accept
bail
fortunately
the
law
allows
him
no
option
the
application
for
bail
was
made
in
due
course
to
a
judge
in
chambers
and
in
spite
of
the
bad
example
of
the
magistrate
and
of
justice
charles
it
was
granted
and
wilde
was
set
free
in
his
own
recognizance
of
with
two
other
sureties
for
each
it
spoke
volumes
for
the
charm
and
fascination
of
the
man
that
people
were
found
to
undertake
this
onerous
responsibility
their
names
deserve
to
be
recorded
one
was
lord
douglas
of
hawick
the
other
a
clergyman
the
rev
stewart
headlam
i
offered
to
be
one
bail
but
i
was
not
a
householder
at
the
time
and
my
name
was
therefore
not
acceptable
i
suppose
the
treasury
objected
which
shows
i
am
inclined
to
think
some
glimmering
of
sense
on
its
part
as
soon
as
the
bail
was
accepted
i
began
to
think
of
preparations
for
escape
it
was
high
time
something
was
done
to
save
him
from
the
wolves
the
day
after
his
release
a
london
morning
journal
was
not
ashamed
to
publish
what
it
declared
was
a
correct
analysis
of
the
voting
of
the
jury
on
the
various
counts
according
to
this
authority
ten
jurors
were
generally
for
conviction
and
two
against
in
the
case
of
wilde
the
statement
was
widely
accepted
because
it
added
that
the
voting
was
more
favourable
to
taylor
than
to
wilde
which
was
so
unexpected
and
so
senseless
that
it
carried
with
it
a
certain
plausibility
credo
quia
incredible
i
had
seen
enough
of
english
justice
and
english
judges
and
english
journals
to
convince
me
that
oscar
wilde
had
no
more
chance
of
a
fair
trial
than
if
he
had
been
an
irish
invincible
everyone
had
made
up
his
mind
and
would
not
even
listen
to
reason
he
was
practically
certain
to
be
convicted
and
if
convicted
perfectly
certain
to
be
punished
with
savage
ferocity
the
judge
would
probably
think
he
was
showing
impartiality
by
punishing
him
for
his
qualities
of
charm
and
high
intelligence
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
understood
the
full
significance
of
montaigne
confession
that
if
he
were
accused
of
stealing
the
towers
of
notre
dame
he
would
fly
the
kingdom
rather
than
risk
a
trial
and
montaigne
was
a
lawyer
i
set
to
work
at
once
to
complete
my
preparations
i
did
not
think
i
ran
any
risk
in
helping
oscar
to
get
away
the
newspapers
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
the
trials
before
the
magistrate
and
before
justice
charles
and
had
overwhelmed
the
public
with
such
a
sea
of
nauseous
filth
and
impurity
as
could
only
be
exposed
to
the
public
nostrils
in
pudibond
england
everyone
i
thought
must
be
sick
of
the
testimony
and
eager
to
have
done
with
the
whole
thing
in
this
i
may
have
been
mistaken
the
hatred
of
wilde
seemed
universal
and
extraordinarily
malignant
i
wanted
a
steam
yacht
curiously
enough
on
the
very
day
when
i
was
thinking
of
running
down
to
cowes
to
hire
one
a
gentleman
at
lunch
mentioned
that
he
had
one
in
the
thames
i
asked
him
could
i
charter
it
certainly
he
replied
and
i
will
let
you
have
it
for
the
bare
cost
for
the
next
month
or
two
one
month
will
do
for
me
i
said
where
are
you
going
he
asked
i
do
know
why
but
a
thought
came
into
my
head
i
would
tell
him
the
truth
and
see
what
he
would
say
i
took
him
aside
and
told
him
the
bare
facts
at
once
he
declared
that
the
yacht
was
at
my
service
for
such
work
as
that
without
money
he
would
be
too
glad
to
lend
it
to
me
it
was
horrible
that
such
a
man
as
wilde
should
be
treated
as
a
common
criminal
he
felt
as
henry
viii
felt
in
shakespeare
play
of
that
name
there
some
of
ye
i
see
more
out
of
malice
than
integrity
would
try
him
to
the
utmost
it
was
not
the
generosity
in
my
friend
offer
that
astonished
me
but
the
consideration
for
wilde
i
thought
the
lenity
so
singular
in
england
that
i
feel
compelled
to
explain
it
though
an
englishman
born
and
bred
my
friend
was
by
race
a
jew
a
man
of
the
widest
culture
who
had
no
sympathy
whatever
with
the
vice
attributed
to
oscar
feeling
consoled
because
there
was
at
least
one
generous
kind
heart
in
the
world
i
went
next
day
to
willie
wilde
house
in
oakley
street
to
see
oscar
i
had
written
to
him
on
the
previous
evening
that
i
was
coming
to
take
oscar
out
to
lunch
willie
wilde
met
me
at
the
door
he
was
much
excited
apparently
by
the
notoriety
attaching
to
oscar
he
was
volubly
eager
to
tell
me
that
though
we
had
not
been
friends
yet
my
support
of
oscar
was
most
friendly
and
he
would
therefore
bury
the
hatchet
he
had
never
interested
me
and
i
was
unconscious
of
any
hatchet
and
careless
whether
he
buried
it
or
blessed
it
i
repeated
drily
that
i
had
come
to
take
oscar
to
lunch
i
know
you
have
he
said
and
it
most
kind
of
you
but
he
ca
go
why
not
i
asked
as
i
went
in
oscar
was
gloomy
depressed
and
evidently
suffering
willie
theatrical
insincerity
had
annoyed
me
a
little
and
i
was
eager
to
get
away
suddenly
i
saw
sherard
who
has
since
done
his
best
for
oscar
memory
in
his
book
there
is
a
record
of
this
visit
of
mine
he
was
standing
silently
by
the
wall
i
come
to
take
you
to
lunch
i
said
to
oscar
but
he
can
not
go
out
cried
willie
of
course
he
can
i
insisted
i
come
to
take
him
but
where
to
asked
willie
yes
frank
where
to
repeated
oscar
meekly
anywhere
you
like
i
said
the
savoy
if
you
like
the
cafe
royal
for
choice
oh
frank
i
dare
not
cried
oscar
no
no
cried
willie
there
would
be
a
scandal
someone
insult
him
and
it
would
do
harm
set
people
backs
up
oh
frank
i
dare
not
echoed
oscar
no
one
will
insult
him
there
will
be
no
scandal
i
replied
and
it
will
do
good
but
what
will
people
say
cried
willie
no
one
ever
knows
what
people
will
say
i
retorted
and
people
always
speak
best
of
those
who
do
care
a
damn
what
they
do
say
oh
frank
i
could
not
go
to
a
place
like
the
savoy
where
i
am
well
known
objected
oscar
all
right
i
agreed
you
shall
go
where
you
like
all
london
is
before
us
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
and
it
will
do
you
good
to
get
out
into
the
air
and
sun
yourself
and
feel
the
wind
in
your
face
come
there
a
hansom
at
the
door
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
conquered
his
objections
and
willie
absurdities
and
taken
him
with
me
scarcely
had
we
left
the
house
when
his
spirits
began
to
lift
and
he
rippled
into
laughter
really
frank
it
is
strange
but
i
do
not
feel
frightened
and
depressed
any
more
and
the
people
do
boo
and
hiss
at
me
is
it
not
dreadful
the
way
they
insult
the
fallen
we
are
not
going
to
talk
about
it
i
said
we
are
going
to
talk
of
victories
and
not
of
defeats
ah
frank
there
will
be
no
more
victories
for
me
nonsense
i
cried
now
where
are
we
going
some
quiet
place
where
i
shall
not
be
known
you
really
would
not
like
the
cafe
royal
i
asked
nothing
will
happen
to
you
and
i
think
you
would
probably
find
that
one
or
two
people
would
wish
you
luck
you
have
had
a
rare
bad
time
and
there
must
be
some
people
who
understand
what
you
have
gone
through
and
know
that
it
is
sufficient
punishment
for
any
sin
no
frank
he
persisted
i
can
not
i
really
can
not
at
length
we
decided
on
a
restaurant
in
great
portland
street
we
drove
there
and
had
a
private
room
i
had
two
purposes
in
me
springing
from
the
one
root
the
intense
desire
to
help
him
i
felt
sure
that
if
the
case
came
up
again
for
trial
he
would
only
be
convicted
through
what
i
may
call
good
honest
testimony
the
jury
with
their
english
prejudice
or
rather
i
should
say
with
their
healthy
english
instincts
would
not
take
the
evidence
of
vile
blackmailers
against
him
he
could
only
be
convicted
through
untainted
evidence
such
as
the
evidence
of
the
chambermaids
at
the
savoy
hotel
and
their
evidence
was
over
two
years
old
and
was
weak
inasmuch
as
the
facts
if
facts
were
not
acted
upon
by
the
management
still
their
testimony
was
very
clear
and
very
positive
and
taken
together
with
that
of
the
blackmailers
sufficient
to
ensure
conviction
after
our
lunch
i
laid
this
view
before
oscar
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
probably
the
chambermaids
testimony
which
had
weighed
most
heavily
against
him
their
statement
and
shelley
had
brought
about
the
injurious
tone
in
the
summing
up
the
judge
himself
had
admitted
as
much
the
chambermaids
evidence
is
wrong
oscar
declared
they
are
mistaken
frank
it
was
not
me
they
spoke
about
at
the
savoy
hotel
it
was
i
was
never
bold
enough
i
went
to
see
in
the
morning
in
his
room
thank
god
i
said
but
why
did
sir
edward
clarke
bring
that
out
he
wanted
to
but
i
would
not
let
him
i
told
him
he
must
not
i
must
be
true
to
my
friend
i
could
not
let
him
but
he
must
i
said
at
any
rate
if
he
does
not
i
will
i
have
three
weeks
and
in
that
three
weeks
i
am
going
to
find
the
chambermaid
i
am
going
to
get
a
plan
of
your
room
and
your
friend
room
and
i
going
to
make
her
understand
that
she
was
mistaken
she
probably
remembered
you
because
of
your
size
she
mistook
you
for
the
guilty
person
everybody
has
always
taken
you
for
the
ringleader
and
not
the
follower
but
what
good
is
it
frank
what
good
is
it
he
cried
even
if
you
convinced
the
chambermaid
and
she
retracted
there
would
still
be
shelley
and
the
judge
laid
stress
on
shelley
evidence
as
untainted
shelley
is
an
accomplice
i
cried
his
testimony
needs
corroboration
you
do
understand
these
legal
quibbles
but
there
was
not
a
particle
of
corroboration
sir
edward
clarke
should
have
had
his
testimony
ruled
out
was
that
conspiracy
charge
i
cried
which
complicated
the
matter
shelley
evidence
too
will
be
ruled
out
at
the
next
trial
you
see
oh
frank
he
said
you
talk
with
passion
and
conviction
as
if
i
were
innocent
but
you
are
innocent
i
cried
in
amaze
are
you
no
frank
he
said
i
thought
you
knew
that
all
along
i
stared
at
him
stupidly
no
i
said
dully
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
believe
the
accusation
i
did
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
i
suppose
the
difference
in
my
tone
and
manner
struck
him
for
he
said
timidly
putting
out
his
hand
this
will
make
a
great
difference
to
you
frank
no
i
said
pulling
myself
together
and
taking
his
hand
and
after
a
pause
i
went
on
no
curiously
enough
it
has
made
no
difference
to
me
at
all
i
do
not
know
why
i
suppose
i
have
got
more
sympathy
than
morality
in
me
it
has
surprised
me
dumbfounded
me
the
thing
has
always
seemed
fantastic
and
incredible
to
me
and
now
you
make
it
exist
for
me
but
it
has
no
effect
on
my
friendship
none
upon
my
resolve
to
help
you
but
i
see
that
the
battle
is
going
to
be
infinitely
harder
than
i
imagined
in
fact
now
i
do
think
we
have
a
chance
of
winning
a
verdict
i
came
here
hoping
against
fear
that
it
could
be
won
though
i
always
felt
that
it
would
be
better
in
the
present
state
of
english
feeling
to
go
abroad
and
avoid
the
risk
of
a
trial
now
there
is
no
question
you
would
be
insane
as
clarke
said
to
stay
in
england
but
why
on
earth
did
alfred
douglas
knowing
the
truth
ever
wish
you
to
attack
queensberry
he
very
bold
and
obstinate
frank
said
oscar
weakly
well
now
i
must
play
crito
i
resumed
smiling
and
take
you
away
before
the
ship
comes
from
delos
oh
frank
that
would
be
wonderful
but
it
impossible
quite
impossible
i
should
be
arrested
before
i
left
london
and
shamed
again
in
public
they
would
boo
at
me
and
shout
insults
oh
it
is
impossible
i
could
not
risk
it
nonsense
i
replied
i
believe
the
authorities
would
be
only
too
glad
if
you
went
i
think
clarke
challenge
to
gill
was
curiously
he
should
have
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
combative
gill
was
certain
to
take
up
the
gauntlet
if
clarke
had
lain
low
there
might
have
been
no
second
trial
but
that
ca
be
helped
now
do
believe
that
it
even
difficult
to
get
away
it
easy
i
do
propose
to
go
by
folkestone
or
dover
but
frank
what
about
the
people
who
have
stood
bail
for
me
i
could
leave
them
to
suffer
they
would
lose
their
thousands
i
sha
let
them
lose
i
replied
i
am
quite
willing
to
take
half
on
my
own
shoulders
at
once
and
you
can
pay
the
other
thousand
or
so
within
a
very
short
time
by
writing
a
couple
of
plays
american
papers
would
be
only
too
glad
to
pay
you
for
an
interview
the
story
of
your
escape
would
be
worth
a
thousand
pounds
they
would
give
you
almost
any
price
for
it
leave
everything
to
me
but
in
the
meantime
i
want
you
to
get
out
in
the
air
as
much
as
possible
you
are
not
looking
well
you
are
not
yourself
that
house
is
depressing
frank
willie
makes
such
a
merit
of
giving
me
shelter
he
means
well
i
suppose
but
it
is
all
dreadful
my
notes
of
this
talk
finish
in
this
way
but
the
conversation
left
on
me
a
deep
impression
of
oscar
extraordinary
weakness
or
rather
extraordinary
softness
of
nature
backed
up
and
redeemed
by
a
certain
magnanimity
he
would
not
leave
the
friends
in
the
lurch
who
had
gone
bail
for
him
he
would
not
give
his
friend
away
even
to
save
himself
but
neither
would
he
exert
himself
greatly
to
win
free
he
was
like
a
woman
i
said
to
myself
in
wonder
and
my
pity
for
him
grew
keener
he
seemed
mentally
stunned
by
the
sudden
fall
by
the
discovery
of
how
violently
men
can
hate
he
had
never
seen
the
wolf
in
man
before
the
vile
brute
instinct
that
preys
upon
the
fallen
he
had
not
believed
that
such
exultant
savagery
existed
it
had
never
come
within
his
ken
now
it
appalled
him
and
so
he
stood
there
waiting
for
what
might
happen
without
courage
to
do
anything
but
suffer
my
heart
ached
with
pity
for
him
and
yet
i
felt
a
little
impatient
with
him
as
well
why
give
up
like
that
the
eternal
quarrel
of
the
combative
nature
with
those
who
ca
or
wo
fight
before
getting
into
the
carriage
to
drive
back
to
his
brother
i
ascertained
that
he
did
not
need
any
money
he
told
me
that
he
had
sufficient
even
for
the
expenses
of
a
second
trial
this
surprised
me
greatly
for
he
was
very
careless
about
money
but
i
found
out
from
him
later
that
a
very
noble
and
cultured
woman
a
friend
of
both
of
us
miss
s
a
jewess
by
race
tho
not
by
religion
had
written
to
him
asking
if
she
could
help
him
financially
as
she
had
been
distressed
by
hearing
of
his
bankruptcy
and
feared
that
he
might
be
in
need
if
that
were
the
case
she
begged
him
to
let
her
be
his
banker
in
order
that
he
might
be
properly
defended
he
wrote
in
reply
saying
that
he
was
indeed
in
uttermost
distress
that
he
wanted
money
too
to
help
his
mother
as
he
had
always
helped
her
and
that
he
supposed
the
expenses
of
the
second
trial
would
be
from
to
thereupon
miss
s
sent
him
a
cheque
for
assuring
him
that
it
cost
her
little
even
in
and
declaring
that
it
was
only
inadequate
recognition
of
the
pleasure
she
had
had
through
his
delightful
talks
such
actions
are
beyond
praise
it
is
the
perfume
of
such
sweet
and
noble
human
sympathy
that
makes
this
wild
beasts
cage
of
a
world
habitable
for
men
before
parting
we
had
agreed
to
meet
a
few
nights
afterwards
at
leverson
where
he
had
been
invited
to
dinner
and
where
i
also
had
been
invited
by
that
time
i
thought
to
myself
all
my
preparations
would
be
perfected
looking
back
now
i
see
clearly
that
my
affection
for
oscar
wilde
dates
from
his
confession
to
me
that
afternoon
i
had
been
a
friend
of
his
for
years
but
what
had
bound
us
together
had
been
purely
intellectual
a
community
of
literary
tastes
and
ambitions
now
his
trust
in
me
and
frankness
had
thrown
down
the
barrier
between
us
and
made
me
conscious
of
the
extraordinary
femininity
and
gentle
weakness
of
his
nature
and
instead
of
condemning
him
as
i
have
always
condemned
that
form
of
sexual
indulgence
i
felt
only
pity
for
him
and
a
desire
to
protect
and
help
him
from
that
day
on
our
friendship
became
intimate
i
began
to
divine
him
i
knew
now
that
his
words
would
always
be
more
generous
and
noble
than
his
actions
knew
too
that
i
must
take
his
charm
of
manner
and
vivacity
of
intercourse
for
real
virtues
and
indeed
they
were
as
real
as
the
beauty
of
flowers
and
i
was
aware
as
by
some
sixth
sense
that
where
his
vanity
was
concerned
i
might
expect
any
injustice
from
him
i
was
sure
beforehand
however
that
i
should
always
forgive
him
or
rather
that
i
should
always
accept
whatever
he
did
and
love
him
for
the
charm
and
sweetness
and
intellect
in
him
and
hold
myself
more
than
recompensed
for
anything
i
might
be
able
to
do
by
his
delightful
companionship

spite
of
the
wit
of
the
hostess
and
her
exquisite
cordiality
our
dinner
at
leverson
was
hardly
a
success
oscar
was
not
himself
contrary
to
his
custom
he
sat
silent
and
downcast
from
time
to
time
he
sighed
heavily
and
his
leaden
dejection
gradually
infected
all
of
us
i
was
not
sorry
for
i
wanted
to
get
him
away
early
by
ten
we
had
left
the
house
and
were
in
the
cromwell
road
he
preferred
to
walk
without
his
noticing
it
i
turned
up
queen
gate
towards
the
park
after
walking
for
ten
minutes
i
said
to
him
i
want
to
speak
to
you
seriously
do
you
happen
to
know
where
erith
is
no
frank
it
is
a
little
landing
place
on
the
thames
i
went
on
not
many
miles
away
it
can
be
reached
by
a
fast
pair
of
horses
and
a
brougham
in
a
very
short
time
there
at
erith
is
a
steam
yacht
ready
to
start
at
a
moment

she
has
steam

she
can
do

in

she
would

eh
high

indeed
where
there
is
freedom

if

started
now
one
could
breakfast
in

let
us
say
or

one
could
lunch
at

or
enogat
or
any
place
you
like
on
the
coast
of
normandy
and
one
could
dine
comfortably
at
the
sables
where
there
is

englishman
to
be
found
and
where
sunshine
reigns
even
in

what
do
you
say

will
you
come
and
try
a
homely
french
bourgeois
dinner
tomorrow
evening
at
an
inn
i
know
almost
at
the
water
edge
we
could
sit
out
on
the
little
terrace
and
take
our
coffee
in
peace
under
the
broad
vine
leaves
while
watching
the
silver
pathway
of
the
moon
widen
on
the
waters
we
could
smile
at
the
miseries
of
london
and
its
wolfish
courts
shivering
in
cold
grey
mist
hundreds
of
miles
away
does
not
the
prospect
tempt
you
i
spoke
at
leisure
tasting
each
delight
looking
for
his
gladness
oh
frank
he
cried
how
wonderful
but
how
impossible
impossible
do
be
absurd
i
retorted
do
you
see
those
lights
yonder
and
i
showed
him
some
lights
at
the
park
gate
on
the
top
of
the
hill
in
front
of
us
yes
frank
that
a
brougham
i
said
with
a
pair
of
fast
horses
it
will
take
us
for
a
midnight
visit
to
the
steam
yacht
in
time
there
a
little
library
on
board
of
french
books
and
english
i
ordered
supper
in
the
cabin
lobster
a
and
a
bottle
of
pommery
you
never
seen
the
mouth
of
the
thames
at
night
have
you
it
a
scene
from
wonderland
houses
like
blobs
of
indigo
fencing
you
in
ships
drifting
past
like
black
ghosts
in
the
misty
air
and
the
purple
sky
above
never
so
dark
as
the
river
the
river
with
its
shifting
lights
of
ruby
and
emerald
and
topaz
like
an
oily
opaque
serpent
gliding
with
a
weird
life
of
its
own
come
you
must
visit
the
yacht
i
turned
to
him
but
he
was
no
longer
by
my
side
i
gasped
what
had
happened
the
mist
must
have
hidden
him
i
ran
back
ten
yards
and
there
he
was
leaning
against
the
railing
hung
up
with
his
head
on
his
arm
shaking
what
the
matter
oscar
i
cried
what
on
earth
the
matter
oh
frank
i
ca
go
he
cried
i
ca
it
would
be
too
wonderful
but
it
impossible
i
should
be
seized
by
the
police
you
do
know
the
police
nonsense
i
cried
the
police
ca
stop
you
and
not
a
man
of
them
will
see
you
from
start
to
finish
besides
i
have
loose
money
for
any
i
do
meet
and
none
of
them
can
resist
a
you
will
simply
get
out
of
the
brougham
and
walk
fifty
yards
and
you
will
be
on
the
yacht
and
free
in
fact
if
you
like
you
shall
not
come
out
of
the
brougham
until
the
sailors
surround
you
as
a
guard
of
honour
on
board
the
yacht
no
one
will
touch
you
no
warrant
runs
there
come
on
man
oh
frank
he
groaned
it
impossible
what
impossible
i
insisted
let
consider
everything
anew
at
breakfast
morning
in
france
if
you
want
to
come
back
there
nothing
to
prevent
you
the
yacht
will
take
you
back
in
hours
you
will
not
have
broken
your
bail
you
have
done
nothing
wrong
you
can
go
to
france
germany
or
siberia
so
long
as
you
come
back
by
the
twentieth
of
may
take
it
that
i
offer
you
a
holiday
in
france
for
ten
days
surely
it
is
better
to
spend
a
week
with
me
than
in
that
dismal
house
in
oakley
street
where
the
very
door
gives
one
the
creeps
oh
frank
i
love
to
he
groaned
i
see
everything
you
say
but
i
ca
i
dare
not
i
caught
frank
in
a
trap
i
can
only
wait
for
the
end
i
began
to
get
impatient
he
was
weaker
than
i
had
imagined
weaker
a
hundred
times
come
for
a
trip
then
man
i
cried
and
i
brought
him
within
twenty
yards
of
the
carriage
but
there
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
no
no
i
ca
come
i
could
not
go
about
in
france
feeling
that

might
fall
on
my
shoulder
at
any
moment
i
could
not
live
a
life
of
fear
and
doubt
it
would
kill
me
in
a
month
his
tone
was
decided
why
let
your
imagination
run
away
with
you
i
pleaded
do
be
reasonable
for
once
fear
and
doubt
would
soon
be
over
if
the
police
do
get
you
in
france
within
a
week
after
the
date
fixed
for
the
trial
you
need
have
no
further
fear
for
they
wo
get
you
at
all
they
do
want
you
you
making
mountains
out
of
molehills
with
nervous
fancies
i
should
be
arrested
nonsense
i
replied
who
would
arrest
you
no
one
has
the
right
you
are
out
on
bail
your
bail
answers
for
you
till
the
money
talks
man
englishmen
always
listen
to
money
it
do
you
good
with
the
public
and
the
jury
to
come
back
from
france
to
stand
your
trial
do
come
and
i
took
him
by
the
arm
but
he
would
not
move
to
my
astonishment
he
faced
me
and
said
and
my
sureties
we
pay
i
replied
both
of
if
you
break
your
bail
come
but
he
would
not
frank
if
i
were
not
in
oakley
street
willie
would
tell
the
police
your
brother
i
cried
yes
he
said
willie
good
god
i
exclaimed
but
let
him
tell
i
have
not
mentioned
erith
or
the
steam
yacht
to
a
soul
it
the
last
place
in
the
world
the
police
would
suspect
and
before
he
talks
we
shall
be
out
of
reach
besides
they
can
not
do
anything
you
are
doing
nothing
wrong
please
trust
me
you
do
nothing
questionable
even
till
you
omit
to
enter
the
old
bailey
on
the
of
may
you
do
know
willie
he
continued
he
has
made
my
solicitors
buy
letters
of
mine
he
has
blackmailed
me
whew
i
whistled
but
in
that
case
you
have
no
compunction
in
leaving
him
without
saying
let
go
and
get
into
the
brougham
no
no
he
repeated
you
do
understand
i
ca
go
i
can
not
go
do
you
mean
it
really
i
asked
do
you
mean
you
will
not
come
and
spend
a
week
yachting
with
me
i
can
not
i
drew
him
a
few
paces
nearer
the
carriage
something
of
desolation
and
despair
in
his
voice
touched
me
i
looked
at
him
tears
were
pouring
down
his
face
he
was
the
picture
of
misery
yet
i
could
not
move
him
come
into
the
carriage
i
said
hoping
that
the
swift
wind
in
his
face
would
freshen
him
up
give
him
a
moment
taste
of
the
joy
of
living
and
sharpen
the
desire
of
freedom
yes
frank
he
said
if
you
will
take
me
to
oakley
street
i
would
as
soon
take
you
to
prison
i
replied
but
as
you
wish
the
next
moment
we
had
got
in
and
were
swinging
down
queen
gate
the
mist
seemed
to
lend
keenness
to
the
air
at
the
bottom
of
queen
gate
the
coachman
swept
of
himself
to
the
left
into
the
cromwell
road
oscar
seemed
to
wake
out
of
his
stupor
no
frank
he
cried
no
no
and
he
fumbled
at
the
handle
of
the
door
i
must
get
out
i
will
not
go
i
will
not
go
sit
still
i
said
in
despair
i
tell
the
coachman
and
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
cried
oakley
street
oakley
street
chelsea
robert
i
do
not
think
i
spoke
again
till
we
got
to
oakley
street
i
was
consumed
with
rage
and
contemptuous
impatience
i
had
done
the
best
i
knew
and
had
failed
why
i
had
no
idea
i
have
never
known
why
he
refused
to
come
i
do
think
he
knew
himself
such
resignation
i
had
never
dreamt
of
it
was
utterly
new
to
me
i
used
to
think
of
resignation
in
a
vague
way
as
of
something
rather
beautiful
ever
since
i
have
thought
of
it
with
impatience
resignation
is
the
courage
of
the
irresolute
oscar
obstinacy
was
the
obverse
of
his
weakness
it
is
astonishing
how
inertia
rules
some
natures
the
attraction
of
waiting
and
doing
nothing
is
intense
for
those
who
live
in
thought
and
detest
action
as
we
turned
into
oakley
street
oscar
said
to
me
you
are
not
angry
with
me
frank
and
he
put
out
his
hand
no
no
i
said
why
should
i
be
angry
you
are
the
master
of
your
fate
i
can
only
offer
advice
do
come
and
see
me
soon
he
pleaded
my
bolt
is
shot
i
replied
but
i
come
in
two
or
three
days
time
as
soon
as
i
have
anything
of
importance
to
say
do
forget
oscar
the
yacht
is
there
and
will
be
there
waiting
until
the
the
yacht
will
always
be
ready
and
the
brougham
good
night
frank
he
said
good
night
and
thank
you
he
got
out
and
went
into
the
house
the
gloomy
sordid
house
where
the
brother
lived
who
would
sell
his
blood
for
a
price
three
or
four
days
later
we
met
again
but
to
my
amaze
oscar
had
not
changed
his
mind
to
talk
of
him
as
cast
down
is
the
precise
truth
he
seemed
to
me
as
one
who
had
fallen
from
a
great
height
and
lay
half
conscious
stunned
on
the
ground
the
moment
you
moved
him
even
to
raise
his
head
it
gave
him
pain
and
he
cried
out
to
be
left
alone
there
he
lay
prone
and
no
one
could
help
him
it
was
painful
to
witness
his
dumb
misery
his
mind
even
his
sunny
bright
intelligence
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
once
again
he
came
out
with
me
to
lunch
afterwards
we
drove
through
park
as
the
quietest
way
to
hampstead
and
had
a
talk
the
air
and
swift
motion
did
him
good
the
beauty
of
the
view
from
the
heath
seemed
to
revive
him
i
tried
to
cheer
him
up
you
must
know
i
said
that
you
can
win
if
you
want
to
you
can
not
only
bring
the
jury
to
doubt
but
you
can
make
the
judge
doubt
as
well
i
was
convinced
of
your
innocence
in
spite
of
all
the
witnesses
and
i
knew
more
about
you
than
they
did
in
the
trial
before
justice
charles
the
thing
that
saved
you
was
that
you
spoke
of
the
love
of
david
and
jonathan
and
the
sweet
affection
which
the
common
world
is
determined
not
to
understand
there
is
another
point
against
you
which
you
have
not
touched
on
yet
gill
asked
you
what
you
had
in
common
with
those
and
stable
boys
you
have
not
explained
that
you
have
explained
that
you
love
youth
the
brightness
and
the
gaiety
of
it
but
you
have
not
explained
what
seems
inexplicable
to
most
men
that
you
should
go
about
with
servants
and
strappers
difficult
to
explain
frank
is
it
without
the
truth
evidently
his
mind
was
not
working
no
i
replied
easy
simple
think
of
shakespeare
how
did
he
know
dogberry
and
pistol
bardolph
and
doll
tearsheet
he
must
have
gone
about
with
them
you
do
go
about
with
public
school
boys
of
your
own
class
for
you
know
them
you
have
nothing
to
learn
from
them
they
can
teach
you
nothing
but
the
stable
boy
and
servant
you
can
not
sketch
in
your
plays
without
knowing
him
and
you
ca
know
him
without
getting
on
his
level
and
letting
him
call
you
and
calling
him
if
you
rub
this
in
the
judge
will
see
that
he
is
face
to
face
with
the
artist
in
you
and
will
admit
at
least
that
your
explanation
is
plausible
he
will
hesitate
to
condemn
you
and
once
he
hesitates
you
win
you
fought
badly
because
you
did
not
show
your
own
nature
sufficiently
you
did
not
use
your
brains
in
the
witness
box
and
alas
i
did
not
continue
the
truth
was
i
was
filled
with
fear
for
i
suddenly
realised
that
he
had
shown
more
courage
and
in
the
queensberry
trial
than
in
the
trial
before
justice
charles
when
so
much
more
was
at
stake
and
i
felt
that
in
the
next
trial
he
would
be
more
depressed
still
and
less
inclined
to
take
the
initiative
than
ever
i
had
already
learned
too
that
i
could
not
help
him
that
he
would
not
be
lifted
out
of
that
sweet
way
of
despair
which
so
attracts
the
artist
spirit
but
still
i
would
do
my
best
do
you
understand
i
asked
of
course
frank
of
course
but
you
have
no
conception
how
weary
i
am
of
the
whole
thing
of
the
shame
and
the
struggling
and
the
hatred
to
see
those
people
coming
into
the
box
one
after
the
other
to
witness
against
me
makes
me
sick
the
grin
of
the
barristers
the
pompous
foolish
judge
with
his
thin
lips
and
cunning
eyes
and
hard
jaw
oh
it
terrible
i
feel
inclined
to
stretch
out
my
hands
and
cry
to
them
what
you
will
with
me
in
god
name
only
do
it
quickly
can
not
you
see
that
i
am
worn
out
if
hatred
gives
you
pleasure
indulge
it
they
worry
one
frank
with
ravening
jaws
as
dogs
worry
a
rabbit
yet
they
call
themselves
men
it
is
appalling
the
day
was
dying
the
western
sky
all
draped
with
crimson
saffron
and
rosy
curtains
a
slight
mist
over
london
purple
on
the
horizon
closer
a
mere
wash
of
blue
here
and
there
steeples
pierced
the
thin
veil
like
fingers
pointing
upward
on
the
left
the
dome
of
paul
hung
like
a
grey
bubble
over
the
city
on
the
right
the
twin
towers
of
westminster
with
the
river
and
bridge
which
wordsworth
sang
peace
and
beauty
brooding
everywhere
and
down
there
lost
in
the
mist
the
rat
pit
that
men
call
the
courts
of
justice
there
they
judge
their
fellows
mistaking
indifference
for
impartiality
as
if
anyone
could
judge
his
fellowman
without
love
and
even
with
love
how
far
short
we
all
come
of
that
perfect
sympathy
which
is
above
forgiveness
and
takes
delight
in
succouring
the
weak
comforting
the
the
days
went
swiftly
by
and
my
powerlessness
to
influence
him
filled
me
with
of
course
i
said
to
myself
if
i
knew
him
better
i
should
be
able
to
help
him
would
vanity
do
anything
it
was
his
mainspring
i
could
but
try
he
might
be
led
by
the
hope
of
making
englishmen
talk
of
him
again
talk
of
him
as
one
who
had
dared
to
escape
wonder
what
he
would
do
next
i
would
try
and
i
did
try
but
his
dejection
foiled
me
his
dislike
of
the
struggle
seemed
to
grow
from
day
to
day
he
would
scarcely
listen
to
me
he
was
counting
the
days
to
the
trial
willing
to
accept
an
adverse
decision
even
punishment
and
misery
and
shame
seemed
better
than
doubt
and
waiting
he
surprised
me
by
saying
a
year
frank
they
may
give
me
a
year
half
the
possible
sentence
the
middle
course
that
english
judges
always
take
the
sort
of
compromise
they
think
safe
and
his
eyes
searched
my
face
for
agreement
i
felt
no
such
confidence
in
english
judges
their
compromises
are
usually
bargainings
when
they
get
hold
of
an
artist
they
give
rein
to
their
intuitive
fear
and
hate
but
i
would
not
discourage
him
i
repeated
you
can
win
oscar
if
you
like
my
litany
to
him
his
wan
dejected
smile
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
do
you
want
to
make
them
all
speak
of
you
and
wonder
at
you
again
if
you
were
in
france
everyone
would
be
asking
will
he
come
back
or
disappear
altogether
or
will
he
manifest
himself
henceforth
in
some
new
comedies
more
joyous
and
pagan
than
ever
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
dead
he
seemed
numbed
hypnotised
with
despair
the
punishment
had
already
been
greater
than
he
could
bear
i
began
to
fear
that
prison
if
he
were
condemned
to
it
would
rob
him
of
his
reason
i
sometimes
feared
that
his
mind
was
already
giving
way
so
profound
was
his
depression
so
hopeless
his
despair
the
trial
opened
before
justice
wills
on
the
of
may
the
treasury
had
sent
sir
frank
lockwood
to
lead
gill
horace
avory
and
sutton
oscar
was
represented
by
the
same
counsel
as
on
the
previous
occasion
the
whole
trial
to
me
was
a
nightmare
and
it
was
characterised
from
the
very
beginning
by
atrocious
prejudice
and
injustice
the
high
priests
of
law
were
weary
of
being
balked
eager
to
make
an
end
as
soon
as
the
judge
took
his
seat
sir
edward
clarke
applied
that
the
defendants
should
be
tried
separately
as
they
had
already
been
acquitted
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
be
tried
together
the
judge
called
on
the
to
answer
the
application
the
had
nothing
to
say
but
thought
it
was
in
the
interests
of
the
defendants
to
be
tried
together
for
in
case
they
were
tried
separately
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
the
defendant
taylor
first
sir
edward
clarke
tore
this
pretext
to
pieces
and
justice
wills
brought
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
by
saying
that
he
was
in
possession
of
all
the
evidence
that
had
been
taken
at
the
previous
trials
and
his
opinion
was
that
the
two
defendants
should
be
tried
separately
sir
edward
clarke
then
applied
that
the
case
of
wilde
should
be
taken
first
as
his
name
stood
first
on
the
indictment
and
as
the
first
count
was
directed
against
him
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
taylor
there
are
reasons
present
i
am
sure
too
in
your
lordship
mind
why
wilde
should
not
be
tried
immediately
after
the
other
defendant
justice
wills
remarked
with
seeming
indifference
it
ought
not
to
make
the
least
difference
sir
edward
i
am
sure
i
and
the
jury
will
do
our
best
to
take
care
that
the
last
trial
has
no
influence
at
all
on
the
present
sir
edward
clarke
stuck
to
his
point
he
urged
respectfully
that
as
name
stood
first
on
the
indictment
his
case
should
be
taken
first
justice
wills
said
he
could
not
interfere
with
the
discretion
of
the
prosecution
nor
vary
the
ordinary
procedure
justice
and
fair
play
on
the
one
side
and
precedent
on
the
other
justice
was
waved
out
of
court
with
serene
indifference
thereupon
sir
edward
clarke
pressed
that
the
trial
of
oscar
wilde
should
stand
over
till
the
next
sessions
but
again
justice
wills
refused
precedent
was
silent
now
but
prejudice
was
strong
as
ever
the
case
against
taylor
went
on
the
whole
day
and
was
resumed
next
morning
taylor
went
into
the
box
and
denied
all
the
charges
the
judge
summed
up
dead
against
him
and
at
the
jury
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
in
five
minutes
they
came
into
court
again
with
a
question
which
was
significant
in
answer
to
the
judge
the
foreman
stated
that
they
had
agreed
that
taylor
had
introduced
parker
to
wilde
but
they
were
not
satisfied
with
wilde
guilt
in
the
matter
justice
wills
were
you
agreed
as
to
the
charge
on
the
other
counts
foreman
yes
my
lord
justice
wills
well
possibly
it
would
be
as
well
to
take
your
verdict
upon
the
other
counts
through
the
foreman
the
jury
accordingly
intimated
that
they
found
taylor
guilty
with
regard
to
charles
and
william
parker
in
answer
to
his
lordship
sir
lockwood
said
he
would
take
the
verdict
given
by
the
jury
of
guilty
upon
the
two
counts
a
formal
verdict
having
been
entered
the
judge
ordered
the
prisoner
to
stand
down
postponing
sentence
did
he
postpone
the
sentence
in
order
not
to
frighten
the
next
jury
by
the
severity
of
it
other
reason
i
could
find
none
sir
edward
clarke
then
got
up
and
said
that
as
it
was
getting
rather
late
perhaps
after
the
second
jury
had
disagreed
as
to
wilde
guilt
sir
lockwood
here
interposed
hotly
i
object
to
sir
edward
clarke
making
these
little
speeches
justice
wills
took
the
matter
up
as
well
you
can
hardly
call
it
a
disagreement
sir
edward
though
what
else
he
could
call
it
i
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine
he
then
adjourned
the
case
against
oscar
wilde
till
the
next
day
when
a
different
jury
would
be
impanelled
but
whatever
jury
might
be
called
they
would
certainly
hear
that
their
forerunners
had
found
taylor
guilty
and
they
would
know
that
every
london
paper
without
exception
had
approved
the
finding
what
a
fair
chance
to
give
wilde
it
was
like
trying
an
irish
secretary
before
a
jury
of
fenians
the
next
morning
may
oscar
wilde
appeared
in
the
dock
the
general
opened
the
case
and
then
called
his
witnesses
one
of
the
first
was
edward
shelley
who
in
admitted
that
he
had
been
mentally
ill
when
he
wrote
wilde
those
letters
which
had
been
put
in
evidence
he
was
made
nervous
from
he
said
alfred
wood
admitted
that
he
had
had
money
given
him
quite
recently
practically
blackmailing
money
he
was
as
venomous
as
possible
when
he
went
to
america
he
said
he
told
wilde
that
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
mixing
with
him
wilde
and
douglas
charlie
parker
next
repeated
his
disgusting
testimony
with
ineffable
impudence
and
a
certain
exultation
bestial
ignominy
could
go
no
lower
he
admitted
that
since
the
former
trial
he
had
been
kept
at
the
expense
of
the
prosecution
after
this
confession
the
case
was
adjourned
and
we
came
out
of
court
when
i
reached
fleet
street
i
was
astonished
to
hear
that
there
had
been
a
row
that
same
afternoon
in
piccadilly
between
lord
douglas
of
hawick
and
his
father
the
marquis
of
queensberry
lord
queensberry
it
appears
had
been
writing
disgusting
letters
about
the
wilde
case
to
lord
douglas
wife
meeting
him
in
piccadilly
percy
douglas
stopped
him
and
asked
him
to
cease
writing
obscene
letters
to
his
wife
the
marquis
said
he
would
not
and
the
father
and
son
came
to
blows
queensberry
it
seems
was
exasperated
by
the
fact
that
douglas
of
hawick
was
one
of
those
who
had
gone
bail
for
oscar
wilde
one
of
the
telegrams
which
the
marquis
of
queensberry
had
sent
to
lady
douglas
i
must
put
in
just
to
show
the
insane
nature
of
the
man
who
could
exult
in
a
trial
which
was
damning
the
reputation
of
his
own
son
the
letter
was
manifestly
written
after
the
result
of
the
taylor
trial
must
congratulate
on
verdict
can
not
on
percy
appearance
looks
like
a
dug
up
corpse
fear
too
much
madness
of
kissing
taylor
guilty
turn
tomorrow
queensberry
in
examination
before
the
magistrate
hannay
it
was
stated
that
lord
queensberry
had
been
sending
similar
letters
to
lady
douglas
full
of
the
most
disgusting
charges
against
lord
douglas
his
wife
and
lord
divorced
wife
and
her
family
but
hannay
thought
all
this
provocation
was
of
no
importance
and
bound
over
both
father
and
son
to
keep
the
peace
an
indefensible
decision
a
decision
only
to
be
explained
by
the
sympathy
everywhere
shown
to
queensberry
because
of
his
victory
over
wilde
otherwise
surely
any
honest
magistrate
would
have
condemned
the
father
who
sent
obscene
letters
to
his
son
wife
a
lady
above
reproach
these
vile
letters
and
the
magistrate
bias
seemed
to
me
to
add
the
final
touch
of
the
grotesque
to
the
horrible
vileness
of
the
trial
it
was
all
worthy
of
the
seventh
circle
of
dante
but
dante
had
never
imagined
such
a
father
and
such
judges
next
morning
oscar
wilde
was
again
put
in
the
dock
the
evidence
of
the
queensberry
trial
was
read
and
therewith
the
case
was
closed
for
the
crown
sir
edward
clarke
rose
and
submitted
that
there
was
no
case
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
general
counts
after
a
long
legal
argument
for
and
against
justice
wills
said
that
he
would
reserve
the
question
for
the
court
of
appeal
the
view
he
took
was
that
the
evidence
was
of
the
slenderest
kind
but
he
thought
the
responsibility
must
be
left
with
the
jury
to
this
judge
the
slenderest
kind
of
evidence
was
worthful
so
long
as
it
told
against
the
accused
sir
edward
clarke
then
argued
that
the
cases
of
shelley
parker
and
wood
failed
on
the
ground
of
the
absence
of
corroboration
justice
wills
admitted
that
shelley
showed
a
peculiar
exaltation
of
mind
there
was
too
mental
derangement
in
his
family
and
worst
of
all
there
was
no
corroboration
of
his
statements
accordingly
in
spite
of
the
arguments
of
the
shelley
evidence
was
cut
out
but
shelley
evidence
had
already
been
taken
had
already
prejudiced
the
jury
indeed
it
had
been
the
evidence
which
had
influenced
justice
charles
in
the
previous
trial
to
sum
up
dead
against
the
defendant
justice
charles
called
shelley
the
only
serious
witness
now
it
appeared
that
shelley
evidence
should
never
have
been
taken
at
all
that
the
jury
ought
never
to
have
heard
shelley
testimony
or
the
acceptance
of
it
when
the
court
opened
next
morning
i
knew
that
the
whole
case
depended
on
oscar
wilde
and
the
showing
he
would
make
in
the
box
but
alas
he
was
broken
and
numbed
he
was
not
a
fighter
and
the
length
of
this
contest
might
have
wearied
a
combative
nature
the
began
by
examining
him
on
his
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
and
we
had
the
prose
poem
again
and
the
rest
of
the
ineffable
nonsensical
prejudice
of
the
mind
against
passionate
sentiment
it
came
out
in
evidence
that
lord
alfred
douglas
was
now
in
calais
his
hatred
of
his
father
was
the
causa
causans
of
the
whole
case
he
had
pushed
oscar
into
the
fight
and
oscar
still
intent
on
shielding
him
declared
that
he
had
asked
him
to
go
abroad
sir
edward
clarke
again
did
his
poor
best
he
pointed
out
that
the
trial
rested
on
the
evidence
of
mere
blackmailers
he
would
not
quarrel
with
that
and
discuss
it
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
that
if
blackmailers
were
to
be
listened
to
and
believed
their
profession
might
speedily
become
a
more
deadly
mischief
and
danger
to
society
than
it
had
ever
been
the
speech
was
a
weak
one
but
the
people
in
court
cheered
sir
edward
clarke
the
cheers
were
immediately
suppressed
by
the
judge
the
took
up
the
rest
of
the
day
with
a
rancorous
reply
sir
edward
clarke
even
had
to
remind
him
that
law
officers
of
the
crown
should
try
to
be
impartial
one
instance
of
his
prejudice
may
be
given
examining
oscar
as
to
his
letters
to
lord
alfred
douglas
sir
frank
lockwood
wanted
to
know
whether
he
thought
them
decent
the
witness
replied
yes
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
sir
was
this
gentleman
retort
i
went
out
of
the
court
feeling
certain
that
the
case
was
lost
oscar
had
not
shown
himself
at
all
he
had
not
even
spoken
with
the
vigour
he
had
used
at
the
queensberry
trial
he
seemed
too
despairing
to
strike
a
blow
the
summing
up
of
the
judge
on
may
was
perversely
stupid
and
malevolent
he
began
by
declaring
that
he
was
absolutely
impartial
though
his
view
of
the
facts
had
to
be
corrected
again
and
again
by
sir
edward
clarke
he
went
on
to
regret
that
the
charge
of
conspiracy
should
have
been
introduced
as
it
had
to
be
abandoned
he
then
pointed
out
that
he
could
not
give
a
colourless
summing
up
which
was
of
no
use
to
anybody
his
intelligence
can
be
judged
from
one
crucial
point
he
fastened
on
the
fact
that
oscar
had
burnt
the
letters
which
he
bought
from
wood
which
he
said
were
of
no
importance
except
that
they
concerned
third
parties
the
judge
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
letters
were
indescribably
bad
forgetting
apparently
that
wood
or
his
associates
had
selected
and
retained
the
very
worst
of
them
for
purposes
of
blackmail
and
that
this
judge
himself
after
reading
it
could
attribute
any
weight
to
it
still
he
insisted
that
burning
the
letters
was
an
act
of
madness
whereas
it
seemed
to
everyone
of
the
slightest
imagination
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
an
innocent
man
to
do
at
the
time
oscar
burnt
the
letters
he
had
no
idea
that
he
would
ever
be
on
trial
his
letters
had
been
misunderstood
and
the
worst
of
them
was
being
used
against
him
and
when
he
got
the
others
he
naturally
threw
them
into
the
fire
the
judge
held
that
it
was
madness
and
built
upon
this
inference
a
pyramid
of
guilt
nothing
said
by
wood
should
be
believed
as
he
belongs
to
the
vilest
class
of
criminals
the
strength
of
the
accusation
depends
solely
upon
the
character
of
the
original
introduction
of
wood
to
wilde
as
illustrated
and
fortified
by
the
story
with
regard
to
the
letters
and
their
burning
a
pyramid
of
guilt
carefully
balanced
on
its
apex
if
the
foolish
judge
had
only
read
his
shakespeare
what
does
henry
vi
say
proceed
no
straiter
our
uncle
gloucester
than
from
true
evidence
of
good
esteem
he
be
approved
in
practice
culpable
there
was
no
true
evidence
of
good
esteem
against
wilde
but
the
judge
turned
a
harmless
action
into
a
confession
of
guilt
then
came
an
interruption
which
threw
light
on
the
english
conception
of
justice
the
foreman
of
the
jury
wanted
to
know
in
view
of
the
intimate
relations
between
lord
alfred
douglas
and
the
defendant
whether
a
warrant
against
lord
alfred
douglas
was
ever
issued
justice
wills
i
should
say
not
we
have
never
heard
of
it
foreman
or
ever
contemplated
justice
wills
that
i
can
not
say
nor
can
we
discuss
it
the
issue
of
such
a
warrant
would
not
depend
upon
the
testimony
of
the
parties
but
whether
there
was
evidence
of
such
act
letters
pointing
to
such
relations
would
not
be
sufficient
lord
alfred
douglas
was
not
called
and
you
can
give
what
weight
you
like
to
that
foreman
if
we
are
to
deduce
any
guilt
from
these
letters
it
would
apply
equally
to
lord
alfred
douglas
justice
wills
concurred
in
that
view
but
after
all
he
thought
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
trial
which
was
the
guilt
of
the
accused
the
jury
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
at
half
past
three
after
being
absent
two
hours
they
returned
to
know
whether
there
was
any
evidence
of
charles
parker
having
slept
at
james
place
his
lordship
replied
no
the
jury
shortly
afterwards
returned
again
with
the
verdict
of
guilty
on
all
the
counts
it
may
be
worth
while
to
note
again
that
the
judge
himself
admitted
that
the
evidence
on
some
of
the
counts
was
of
the
slenderest
kind
but
when
backed
by
his
prejudiced
summing
up
it
was
more
than
sufficient
for
the
jury
sir
edward
clarke
pleaded
that
sentence
should
be
postponed
till
the
next
sessions
when
the
legal
argument
would
be
heard
justice
wills
would
not
be
balked
sentence
he
thought
should
be
given
immediately
then
addressing
the
prisoners
he
said
and
again
i
give
his
exact
words
lest
i
should
do
him
wrong
oscar
wilde
and
alfred
taylor
the
crime
of
which
you
have
been
convicted
is
so
bad
that
one
has
to
put
stern
restraint
upon
one
self
to
prevent
one
self
from
describing
in
language
which
i
would
rather
not
use
the
sentiments
which
must
rise
to
the
breast
of
every
man
of
honour
who
has
heard
the
details
of
these
two
terrible
trials
that
the
jury
have
arrived
at
a
correct
verdict
in
this
case
i
can
not
persuade
myself
to
entertain
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
i
hope
at
all
events
that
those
who
sometimes
imagine
that
a
judge
is
in
the
cause
of
decency
and
morality
because
he
takes
care
no
prejudice
shall
enter
into
the
case
may
see
that
that
is
consistent
at
least
with
the
utmost
sense
of
indignation
at
the
horrible
charges
brought
home
to
both
of
you
it
is
no
use
for
me
to
address
you
people
who
can
do
these
things
must
be
dead
to
all
sense
of
shame
and
one
can
not
hope
to
produce
any
effect
upon
them
it
is
the
worst
case
i
have
ever
tried
that
you
wilde
have
been
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
extensive
corruption
of
the
most
hideous
kind
among
young
men
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
i
shall
under
such
circumstances
be
expected
to
pass
the
severest
sentence
that
the
law
allows
in
my
judgment
it
is
totally
inadequate
for
such
a
case
as
this
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
each
of
you
be
imprisoned
and
kept
to
hard
labour
for
two
years
the
sentence
hushed
the
court
in
shocked
surprise
wilde
rose
and
cried
can
i
say
anything
my
lord
justice
wills
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
amid
cries
of
shame
and
hisses
from
the
public
gallery
some
of
the
cries
and
hisses
were
certainly
addressed
to
the
judge
and
well
deserved
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
that
oscar
was
a
centre
of
extensive
corruption
of
the
most
hideous
kind
no
evidence
of
this
had
been
brought
forward
by
the
prosecution
it
was
not
even
alleged
that
a
single
innocent
person
had
been
corrupted
the
accusation
was
invented
by
this
absolutely
impartial
judge
to
justify
his
atrocious
cruelty
the
unmerited
insults
and
appalling
sentence
would
have
disgraced
the
worst
judge
of
the
inquisition
justice
wills
evidently
suffered
from
the
peculiar
exaltation
of
mind
which
he
had
recognised
in
shelley
this
peculiarity
is
shared
in
a
lesser
degree
by
several
other
judges
on
the
english
bench
in
all
matters
of
sexual
morality
what
distinguished
justice
wills
was
that
he
was
proud
of
his
prejudice
and
eager
to
act
on
it
he
evidently
did
not
know
or
did
not
care
that
the
sentence
which
he
had
given
declaring
it
was
totally
inadequate
had
been
condemned
by
a
royal
commission
as
inhuman
he
would
willingly
have
pushed
inhumanity
to
savagery
out
of
sheer
bewigged
stupidity
and
that
he
was
probably
only
intensified
the
revolt
one
felt
at
such
brainless
malevolence
the
bitterest
words
in
dante
are
not
bitter
enough
to
render
my
feeling
non
ragioniam
di
lor
ma
guarda
e
passa
the
whole
scene
had
sickened
me
hatred
masquerading
as
justice
striking
vindictively
and
adding
insult
to
injury
the
vile
picture
had
its
fit
setting
outside
we
had
not
left
the
court
when
the
cheering
broke
out
in
the
streets
and
when
we
came
outside
there
were
troops
of
the
lowest
women
of
the
town
dancing
together
and
kicking
up
their
legs
in
hideous
abandonment
while
the
surrounding
crowd
of
policemen
and
spectators
guffawed
with
delight
as
i
turned
away
from
the
exhibition
as
obscene
and
as
anything
witnessed
in
the
madness
of
the
french
revolution
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
wood
and
the
parkers
getting
into
a
cab
laughing
and
leering
these
were
the
venal
creatures
oscar
wilde
was
punished
for
having
corrupted
