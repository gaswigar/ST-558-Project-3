preface
in
selecting
a
series
of
ghost
stories
for
this
volume
i
have
taken
the
greatest
care
to
make
use
of
those
only
which
are
thoroughly
well
authenticated
the
result
of
this
discrimination
has
been
that
the
majority
of
these
accounts
of
psychic
phenomena
have
been
taken
from
the
lips
of
and
transferred
to
manuscript
in
as
nearly
as
possible
the
narrator
s
own
language
narratives
of
unfamiliar
hauntings
albeit
they
refer
to
the
meaner
class
of
houses
will
i
think
be
more
welcome
to
the
reader
than
the
mere
repetition
of
such
hackneyed
stories
as
those
appertaining
to
glamis
castle
the
tower
of
london
in
one
other
point
too
this
work
may
be
said
to
differ
from
others
dealing
with
the
same
subject
it
is
compiled
and
written
by
a
very
keen
psychic
one
who
has
not
only
investigated
and
lectured
on
haunted
houses
but
has
himself
seen
many
occult
manifestations
as
there
have
been
several
libel
cases
quite
recently
in
connection
with
the
alleged
haunting
of
houses
i
have
been
obliged
save
where
it
is
stated
to
the
contrary
to
give
fictitious
names
to
both
people

localities

one
afternoon
in
the
july
of
this
year
i
took
tea
with
lady
b
at
her
club
in
the
west
end
lady
b
is
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
our
friendship
dating
back
to
the
days
when
i
wore
eton
collars
and
a
preparatory
school
cap
she
was
in
unusually
high
spirits
at
the
thought
of
a
cruise
in
the
baltic
whilst
i
was
equally
exuberant
at
being
once
again
in
london
after
a
very
trying
sojourn
in
a
particularly
remote
and
isolated
town
a
town
renowned
for
pilchards
pasties
and
painters
now
there
is
nothing
mean
nor
petty
about
lady
b
she
is
generosity
itself
so
kind
so
courteous
and
withal
so
daintily
pretty
that
to
be
near
her
even
is
to
be
in
elysium
remembering
the
interest
i
had
always
taken
in
matters
psychical
she
had
invited
several
friends
especially
to
meet
me
and
it
was
from
one
of
them
miss
charlotte
napier
that
i
heard
the
following
story
chancing
to
be
stranded
late
one
night
at
bardsley
she
began
owing
to
a
slight
miscalculation
of
the
i
had
no
other
resource
than
to
put
up
at
the
green
bank
hotel
in
russell
street
it
was
a
very
ordinary
hotel
ordinary
both
in
accommodation
and
appearance
one
part
of
it
that
in
which
i
slept
possibly
dated
back
to
the
elizabethan
period
but
the
rest
most
hideously
renovated
was
quite
modern
outside
my
room
no
was
a
long
and
somewhat
gloomy
corridor
connecting
the
old
and
new
portions
of
the
house
i
retired
to
rest
about
eleven
closing
time
and
had
been
asleep
barely
an
hour
before
i
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
the
room
flooded
with
a
pale
phosphorescent
light
the
moon
shone
through
my
it
gleamed
with
an
unearthly
whiteness
across
the
bed
and
thence
across
the
room
glancing
upon
the
panels
of
the
door
in
such
a
manner
that
i
was
constrained
to
follow
its
course
and
to
fix
my
gaze
wherever
it
shone
the
door
was
a
mass
of
light
i
could
see
each
crack
and
scar
upon
it
even
the
on
the
white
handle
with
painful
distinctness
a
sudden
sensation
of
horror
overcame
me
i
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
able
to
look
elsewhere
i
could
not
all
my
senses
were
centred
upon
the
door
it
enchained
it
drew
me
and
as
i
gazed
at
it
in
helpless
awe
the
sound
of
footsteps
from
without
suddenly
broke
upon
my
ears
instantly
all
my
faculties
were
on
the
alert
and
i
became
the
victim
of
a
curious
sensation
unlike
any
i
had
hitherto
experienced
but
which
i
have
since
learned
is
the
usual
effect
of
psychic
manifestation
i
felt
the
proximity
of
the
unnatural
an
icy
coldness
stole
down
my
back
my
teeth
chattered
my
hair
seemed
to
rise
on
end
and
the
violent
palpitation
of
my
heart
made
me
sick
and
dizzy
my
faculties
had
indeed
become
abnormally
acute
but
my
body
seemed
no
longer
alive
and
i
knew
that
whatever
happened
i
should
be
absolutely
incapable
of
action
my
powerlessness
was
soon
to
be
put
to
the
test
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
in
obedience
to
an
irresistible
impulse
i
listened
listened
with
all
my
might
what
were
those
sounds
they
were
certainly
unlike
any
i
had
ever
heard
before
and
the
kind
of
terror
they
imparted
was
hitherto
unknown
to
me
perhaps
the
nearest
semblance
to
the
kind
of
fear
i
then
felt
is
the
fear
inspired
by
the
sight
of
a
lunatic
i
could
not
stir
i
could
only
wait
and
listen
the
unnatural
nature
of
the
footsteps
was
emphasised
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
moonlight
quite
an
abnormal
feature
in
itself
and
the
intense
hush
which
stealing
surreptitiously
upon
the
house
obliterated
every
other
sound
the
footsteps
gradually
became
interpretative
two
people
were
rushing
headlong
down
the
corridor
from
the
light
flying
footsteps
of
the
foremost
and
the
heavier
tread
and
pace
of
the
hindermost
i
concluded
it
was
a
race
entailing
vital
consequences
and
that
the
fugitive
would
soon
be
caught
caught
but
not
pray
heaven
at
my
door
what
on
earth
had
happened
what
could
happen
in
a
hotel
fire
robbery
or
murder
murder
great
drops
of
sweat
broke
out
upon
my
brow
at
the
bare
thought
the
moon
shone
in
whiter
and
more
coldly
than
ever
whilst
the
steps
drew
nearer
and
nearer
so
near
in
fact
that
i
fancied
i
could
detect
the
sound
of
breathing
short
gasps
of
agony
accompanied
by
easier
and
more
strenuous
inhalations
who
were
the
actors
in
this
invisible
drama
were
they
both
men
i
imagined
not
indeed
a
thousand
horrible
ideas
suggested
themselves
to
my
mind
to
be
interrupted
by
a
terrific
crash
on
the
upper
panels
of
the
door
that
made
me
all
but
die
with
terror
never
had
i
suffered
as
at
that
moment
i
strove
to
scream
it
was
in
vain
my
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
could
utter
no
sound
the
door
which
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
lock
was
unceremoniously
burst
open
and
into
the
room
rushed
a
very
young
and
fragile
looking
man
clad
in
the
costume
of
a
cavalier
of
the
time
of
naseby
whilst
close
at
his
heels
there
followed
a
gigantic
roundhead
armed
with
all
the
terrible
paraphernalia
of
war
the
tableau
was
so
totally
different
from
anything
i
had
anticipated
and
withal
horribly
real
so
real
that
had
it
been
in
my
power
i
must
inevitably
have
raised
a
hand
to
interpose
indeed
the
wretched
fugitive
made
straight
for
my
bed
and
falling
on
his
knees
beside
it
clutched
the
counterpane
convulsively
in
his
fingers
his
ashy
face
was
so
near
mine
that
i
not
only
saw
every
feature
in
it
with
damning
clearness
but
i
read
the
many
varied
expressions
in
his
eyes
they
were
awful
i
read
in
them
despair
terror
hate
overshadowed
in
the
background
by
an
insatiable
craving
for
every
imaginable
vice
yet
they
were
beautiful
eyes
beautiful
both
in
formation
and
colour
too
effeminately
beautiful
for
a
man
his
hair
which
fell
in
a
wild
profusion
of
ringlets
over
forehead
and
shoulders
was
of
a
rich
chestnut
hue
and
most
luxuriant
he
wore
neither
beard
nor
moustaches
he
was
absolutely
clean
shaven
and
his
skin
shone
with
all
the
milky
whiteness
of
that
of
a
young
woman
his
features
were
neatly
moulded
and
extremely
delicate
his
hands
well
shaped
and
narrow
whilst
his
fingers
long
and
tapering
were
crowned
with
pellucid
filbert
nails
attired
in
the
most
costly
and
elegant
manner
a
manner
that
suggested
the
court
fop
rather
than
the
soldier
he
formed
in
every
way
a
marked
contrast
to
his
puritan
pursuer
the
roundhead
was
a
huge
brawny
fellow
dressed
in
a
leathern
jerkin
and
heavy
his
soiled
and
muddy
clothes
betokening
the
wear
and
tear
of
an
arduous
campaign
his
face
always
ugly
and
naturally
perhaps
sullen
and
forbidding
was
now
positively
diabolical
rage
hatred
and
triumph
vieing
with
one
another
for
supremacy
catching
hold
of
the
cavalier
by
his
silken
tresses
and
pulling
back
his
head
by
brute
force
the
cromwellian
slowly
and
deliberately
drew
the
keen
blade
of
his
knife
across
the
doomed
man
s
throat
the
horrid
deed
transacted
amid
the
most
preternatural
silence
was
perpetrated
so
close
to
me
that
i
was
obliged
to
witness
every
revolting
detail
and
although
i
felt
sure
the
victim
was
bad
and
vicious
i
did
not
think
the
vileness
of
his
character
in
any
way
justified
the
atrocity
of
his
assassin
the
murderer
had
barely
accomplished
his
fiendish
design
before
a
deadly
sickness
came
over
me
and
i
fainted
on
recovering
consciousness
the
room
was
once
again
in
darkness
nor
could
i
discover
in
the
morning
any
sign
whatever
of
the
awful
tragedy
on
making
inquiries
in
the
town
i
learned
that
the
inn
was
well
known
to
be
haunted
other
people
as
well
as
i
having
witnessed
the
same
phenomenon
and
that
during
the
recent
renovations
a
skeleton
had
been
unearthed
at
the
foot
of
the
main
staircase
i
saw
it
in
the
local
museum
and
instantly
identified
the
costume
it
wore
as
the
one
i
had
seen
on
the
hapless
fugitive
but
the
skeleton
was
that
of
a
woman
no
southgate
street
bristol
the
notorious
servant
who
answers
the
door
technical
form
of
apparition
phantasm
of
the
dead
source
of
authenticity
signed
by
three
seen
by
author
himself
names
of
people
and
locality
alone
being
altered
in
the
spring
of
being
then
a
member
of
a
certain
psychical
research
society
and
hearing
that
a
ghost
had
been
seen
at
no
southgate
street
bristol
i
set
off
to
interview
the
ladies
who
were
reported
to
have
seen
it
i
found
them
the
misses
rudd
at
home
and
on
their
very
graciously
consenting
to
relate
to
me
their
psychical
experiences
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
following
story
told
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
eldest
lady
s
own
words
it
is
now
she
began
some
ten
years
since
we
were
the
tenants
of
the
house
you
mention
but
i
recollect
what
i
saw
there
as
vividly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
house
i
must
tell
you
is
very
small
only
eight
or
so
rooms
dingy
and
in
a
chronic
state
of
dilapidation
it
stands
in
the
middle
of
a
terrace
with
no
front
garden
to
speak
of
save
a
few
yards
of
tiles
and
broken
whilst
its
back
windows
overlooked
a
dreary
expanse
of
deep
and
silent
water
nothing
more
dismal
could
be
imagined
still
when
we
took
it
the
idea
of
it
being
haunted
never
for
one
instant
entered
our
minds
and
our
first
intimation
that
such
was
the
case
came
upon
us
like
a
thunderbolt
we
only
kept
one
maid
jane
a
girl
with
dark
hair
and
pleasant
manners
my
sisters
and
i
doing
all
the
cooking
and
helping
with
the
light
work
the
morning
on
which
incident
no
happened
knowing
jane
to
be
upstairs
occupied
in
dusting
the
rooms
and
my
sisters
being
out
my
mother
asked
me
to
go
into
the
kitchen
and
see
if
the
stove
was
all
right
as
there
was
a
smell
of
doing
as
she
bid
i
hastened
to
the
kitchen
where
a
strange
spectacle
met
my
sight
kneeling
in
front
of
the
stove
engaged
apparently
in
polishing
the
fender
was
a
with
red
hair
i
started
back
in
astonishment
who
could
she
be
too
intent
at
first
to
notice
my
advent
she
kept
on
at
her
work
giving
me
time
to
observe
that
she
was
wearing
a
very
dirty
dress
and
that
her
rag
of
a
cap
was
quite
askew
satisfied
she
was
not
jane
and
wondering
whether
some
one
else
s
maid
had
mistaken
our
kitchen
for
her
own
the
houses
in
the
terrace
being
all
alike
i
called
out
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
whereupon
dropping
the
with
a
clatter
she
quickly
turned
round
displaying
an
face
the
expression
on
which
literally
froze
me
with
horror
never
never
had
i
seen
such
an
awful
look
of
hopeless
of
desperate
of
diabolical
abandonment
in
any
one
s
eyes
as
in
those
of
hers
when
their
glance
met
mine
for
some
seconds
we
glared
at
one
another
without
moving
and
then
still
regarding
me
with
a
furtive
look
from
out
of
the
corner
of
her
horrible
eyes
she
slowly
rose
from
the
hearth
and
gliding
stealthily
forward
disappeared
in
the
diminutive
scullery
opposite
curiosity
now
overcoming
fear
i
at
once
followed
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
was
there
any
other
mode
of
exit
by
which
she
could
have
made
her
departure
than
a
tiny
window
some
four
feet
or
so
from
the
floor
and
directly
overlooking
the
deep
waters
of
the
pond
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
here
then
was
a
mystery
what
had
i
seen
had
i
actually
encountered
a
phantasm
or
was
i
but
the
victim
of
an
exceedingly
unpleasant
and
falsidical
hallucination
i
preferred
to
think
the
former
not
wishing
to
frighten
my
mother
i
intended
keeping
the
incident
to
myself
writing
however
a
complete
account
of
it
in
my
diary
for
the
current
year
but
a
further
incident
occurring
to
my
youngest
sister
within
the
next
few
days
i
determined
to
reveal
what
i
had
seen
and
compare
the
eldest
miss
rudd
now
concluded
and
on
my
expressing
a
desire
to
hear
more
her
youngest
sister
very
obligingly
commenced
i
had
been
out
shopping
in
the
triangle
one
morning
she
said
and
having
omitted
to
take
the
latchkey
i
was
obliged
to
ring
jane
answered
the
summons
there
was
nothing
of
course
unusual
in
this
as
it
was
her
duty
to
do
so
but
there
was
something
extremely
singular
in
what
appeared
at
her
elbow
standing
close
beside
i
might
almost
say
leaning
against
her
though
jane
was
apparently
unaware
of
it
was
a
strange
a
very
strange
with
red
hair
and
the
most
uncanny
eyes
she
had
on
a
bedraggled
print
dress
and
a
cap
all
askew
but
it
was
her
expression
that
most
attracted
my
attention
it
was
horrid
oh
jane
i
cried
whoever
is
it
with
you
following
the
direction
of
my
gaze
jane
immediately
turned
round
and
without
a
word
fainted
that
is
all
the
apparition
or
whatever
you
may
please
to
call
it
vanished
and
the
next
time
i
saw
it
was
under
different
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
relate
them
i
inquired
miss
rudd
proceeded
oh
it
is
nothing
very
much
she
exclaimed
only
it
was
very
unpleasant
at
the
time
especially
as
i
was
all
alone
you
see
mother
being
delicate
went
to
bed
early
my
sisters
were
at
a
concert
and
it
was
jane
s
night
i
never
somehow
fancied
the
basement
of
the
house
it
was
so
cold
and
damp
reminding
me
not
a
little
of
a
morgue
or
consequently
i
never
stayed
there
a
moment
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
on
this
night
in
question
i
was
in
the
act
of
scurrying
back
to
the
when
a
gentle
tap
tap
at
the
made
me
defer
my
departure
entering
the
back
kitchen
somewhat
timidly
i
admit
i
saw
a
face
peering
in
at
me
through
the
tiny
window
though
the
night
was
dark
and
there
was
no
artificial
lighting
at
this
side
of
the
house
every
feature
of
that
face
was
revealed
to
me
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
day
the
little
untidy
cap
all
awry
surmounting
the
of
red
hair
now
and
dripping
with
water
the
ghastly
white
cheeks
the
widely
open
mouth
and
the
eyes
their
pupils
abnormally
dilated
and
full
of
lurid
light
were
more
appallingly
horrible
than
ever
i
stood
and
gazed
at
it
my
heart
sick
with
terror
nor
do
i
know
what
would
have
happened
to
me
had
not
the
loud
rap
of
the
postman
acted
like
magic
the
thing
vanished
and
turning
tail
i
fled
upstairs
into
the
presence
of
my
mother
that
is
i
was
profuse
in
my
thanks
and
the
third
miss
rudd
then
spoke
my
bedroom
she
began
was
on
the
top
landing
the
window
the
water
i
slept
alone
some
months
after
the
anecdotes
just
related
and
was
awakened
one
night
by
feeling
some
disgusting
wet
object
lying
on
my
forehead
with
an
ejaculation
of
alarm
i
attempted
to
brush
it
aside
and
opening
my
eyes
encountered
a
ghastly
white
face
bending
right
over
me
i
instantly
recognised
it
by
the
description
my
sisters
had
given
as
the
phantasm
of
the
girl
the
eyes
were
terrible
shifting
its
slimy
hand
from
my
forehead
and
brandishing
it
aloft
like
some
murderous
weapon
it
was
about
to
clutch
my
throat
when
human
nature
would
stand
it
no
longer
and
i
fainted
on
recovering
i
found
both
my
sisters
in
the
room
and
after
that
i
never
slept
by
did
your
mother
ever
see
it
i
asked
frequently
the
eldest
miss
rudd
replied
and
it
was
chiefly
on
her
account
we
relinquished
our
tenancy
her
nervous
system
was
completely
other
people
saw
the
ghost
besides
us
the
youngest
miss
rudd
interrupted
for
not
only
did
the
long
succession
of
maids
after
jane
all
see
it
but
many
of
the
subsequent
tenants
the
house
was
never
let
for
any
length
of
then
perhaps
it
is
empty
now
i
soliloquised
in
which
case
i
shall
most
certainly
experiment
this
proved
to
be
the
case
the
house
was
tenantless
and
i
easily
prevailed
upon
the
agent
to
loan
me
the
key
but
the
venture
was
fruitless
three
of
us
and
a
dog
undertook
it
we
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
gloomy
staircase
twelve
o
clock
struck
no
ghost
appeared
the
dog
became
a
nuisance
and
we
came
away
disgusted
a
s
test
however
is
no
test
at
all
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
apparitions
are
always
to
be
seen
by
man
as
yet
we
know
absolutely
nothing
of
the
powers
or
conditions
regulating
their
appearances
and
it
is
surely
feasible
that
the
unknown
controlling
elements
of
one
night
may
have
been
completely
altered
may
even
have
ceased
to
exist
by
the
next
at
all
events
that
was
my
opinion
i
was
by
no
means
daunted
at
a
single
failure
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
any
one
to
accompany
me
the
sceptic
is
so
boastfully
eager
by
day
ghosts
he
sneers
what
are
ghosts
indigestion
and
imagination
i
ll
challenge
you
to
show
me
the
house
i
wouldn
t
sleep
in
alone
ghosts
indeed
give
me
a
poker
or
a
shovel
and
i
will
scare
away
the
lot
of
and
when
you
do
show
him
the
house
he
always
has
a
prior
engagement
or
else
the
weather
is
too
cold
or
he
has
too
much
work
to
do
next
day
or
it
isn
t
really
worth
the
trouble
or
well
he
is
sure
to
have
some
very
plausible
excuse
at
least
that
has
been
my
invariable
experience
there
is
no
greater
coward
than
the
sceptic
and
so
unable
to
procure
a
friend
for
the
occasion
i
did
without
one
neither
did
i
have
the
key
of
the
house
but
taking
french
leave
gained
admittance
through
a
window
it
was
horribly
dark
and
lonely
and
although
on
the
former
occasion
i
did
not
feel
the
presence
of
the
superphysical
i
did
so
now
the
very
moment
i
crossed
the
threshold
striking
a
light
i
looked
around
me
i
was
in
the
damp
and
mouldy
den
that
served
as
a
kitchen
outside
i
saw
the
moon
reflected
on
the
black
and
silent
water
a
long
and
sleek
cockroach
disappeared
leisurely
in
a
hole
in
the
skirting
as
i
flashed
my
light
in
its
direction
and
i
thought
i
detected
the
movement
of
a
rat
or
some
large
animal
in
the
cupboard
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
forthwith
commenced
a
search
the
cupboard
was
empty
i
must
have
been
mistaken
for
some
minutes
i
stood
in
no
little
perplexity
as
to
my
next
move
where
should
i
go
where
ought
i
to
go
if
my
adventure
were
to
prove
successful
i
glanced
at
the
narrow
tortuous
staircase
winding
upwards
into
the
grim
possibilities
of
the
deserted
hall
and
landings
and
my
courage
failed
here
at
least
i
was
safe
should
the
unknown
approach
me
i
could
escape
by
the
same
window
through
which
i
had
entered
i
felt
i
dare
not
i
really
could
not
go
any
further
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
at
nothing
more
substantial
than
my
own
thoughts
i
was
groping
my
way
backwards
to
the
window
when
a
revulsion
of
feeling
made
me
pause
if
all
men
were
poltroons
how
much
would
humanity
ever
know
of
the
occult
we
should
leave
off
where
we
began
and
it
had
ever
been
my
ambition
to
go
further
my
returning
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
pencil
notebook
and
revolver
and
trimming
my
lamp
i
mounted
the
stairs
a
house
of
such
minute
dimensions
did
not
take
long
to
explore
what
rooms
there
were
were
lilliputian
mere
boxes
the
walls
from
which
hung
the
tattered
remnants
of
the
most
offensively
inartistic
papers
were
too
obviously
jerry
built
the
wainscoting
was
scarred
the
beading
broken
not
a
door
fitted
not
a
window
that
was
not
either
loose
or
sashless
the
entire
house
was
rotten
paltry
mean
i
would
not
have
had
it
as
a
gift
but
where
could
i
wait
to
see
the
ghost
disgust
at
my
surroundings
had
for
a
time
made
me
forget
my
fears
these
now
returned
reinforced
i
thought
of
miss
rudd
s
comparison
with
a
morgue
and
shuddered
the
rooms
looked
ghastly
selecting
the
landing
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
storey
i
sat
down
my
back
against
the
wall
and
waited
confronting
me
was
the
staircase
leading
up
and
down
equally
dark
equally
ghostly
on
my
right
was
what
might
once
have
been
the
but
was
now
a
grim
conglomeration
of
bare
boards
and
moonlight
and
on
my
left
was
an
open
window
directly
overtopping
the
broad
expanse
of
colourless
motionless
water
twelve
o
clock
struck
the
friendly
footsteps
of
a
pedestrian
died
away
in
the
distance
i
was
now
beyond
the
pale
of
assistance
alone
and
deserted
deserted
by
all
save
the
slimy
creeping
insects
below
and
the
shadows
yes
the
shadows
and
as
i
watched
them
sporting
phantastically
at
my
feet
i
glanced
into
the
darkness
beyond
and
shivered
all
was
now
intensely
suggestive
and
still
the
road
alone
attractive
and
despite
my
spartonic
resolutions
i
would
have
given
much
to
be
out
in
the
open
the
landing
was
so
cramped
so
hopeless
a
fresh
shadow
the
shadow
of
a
leaf
that
had
hitherto
escaped
my
notice
now
attracted
and
appalled
me
the
scratching
of
an
insect
made
my
heart
stand
still
my
sight
and
hearing
were
painfully
acute
a
familiar
and
sickly
sensation
gradually
crept
over
me
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
increased
the
most
inconceivable
and
desperate
terror
laid
hold
of
me
the
house
was
no
longer
empty
the
supernatural
had
come
something
i
knew
not
i
dare
not
think
what
was
below
and
i
knew
it
would
ascend
all
the
ideas
i
had
previously
entertained
of
addressing
the
ghost
and
taking
notes
were
entirely
annihilated
by
my
fear
fear
mingled
with
a
horrible
wonder
as
to
what
form
the
apparition
would
take
and
i
found
myself
praying
heaven
it
might
not
be
that
of
an
elemental
the
thing
had
now
crossed
the
hall
i
knew
this
somehow
instinctively
and
was
beginning
to
mount
the
stairs
i
could
not
cry
out
i
could
not
stir
i
could
not
close
my
eyes
i
could
only
sit
there
staring
at
the
staircase
in
the
most
awful
of
dumb
apprehensive
agonies
the
thing
drew
nearer
nearer
up
up
up
it
came
until
i
could
see
it
at
last
see
the
of
red
hair
the
white
cheeks
the
pale
staring
eyes
all
rendered
hideously
ghastly
by
the
halo
of
luminous
light
that
played
around
it
this
was
a
ghost
an
apparition
a
phantasm
of
the
dead
and
without
any
display
of
physical
power
it
overcame
me
happily
for
me
the
duration
of
its
passage
was
brief
it
came
within
a
yard
of
me
the
water
dripping
from
its
clinging
clothes
yet
leaving
no
marks
on
the
flooring
it
thrust
its
face
forward
i
thought
it
was
going
to
touch
me
and
tried
to
shrink
away
from
it
but
could
not
yet
it
did
nothing
but
stare
at
me
and
its
eyes
were
all
the
more
horrible
because
they
were
blank
not
diabolical
as
miss
rudd
had
described
them
but
simply
blank
blank
with
the
glassiness
of
the
dead
gliding
past
with
a
slightly
swaying
motion
it
climbed
upstairs
the
night
air
blowing
through
the
bedraggled
dress
in
a
horribly
natural
manner
i
watched
it
till
it
was
out
of
sight
with
bated
breath
for
a
second
or
so
it
stopped
irresolutely
beside
an
open
window
there
was
a
slight
movement
as
of
some
one
mounting
the
sill
a
mad
hilarious
chuckle
a
loud
splash
and
then
silence
after
which
i
went
home
i
subsequently
discovered
that
early
in
the
seventies
a
who
was
in
service
at
that
house
had
committed
suicide
in
the
manner
i
have
just
described
but
whether
or
not
she
had
red
hair
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
the
ghost
i
am
informed
on
very
reliable
authority
is
still
august
to
be
seen
mulready
villa
near
basingstoke
the
black
clock
technical
form
of
apparition
either
a
phantasm
of
the
dead
or
elemental
source
of
authenticity
cause
of
haunting
a
matter
of
surmise
when
i
was
reading
for
the
royal
irish
constabulary
at
that
excellent
and
queen
s
service
academy
in
dublin
i
made
many
friends
among
my
fellow
students
certain
of
whom
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
meet
in
after
life
quite
recently
for
example
whilst
on
a
visit
of
enjoyment
to
london
i
ran
up
against
at
daly
s
theatre
t
one
of
the
fellows
who
ever
trod
in
ely
square
passed
in
second
for
the
royal
irish
constabulary
and
is
now
a
district
inspector
in
some
outlandish
village
in
connemara
and
again
a
summer
or
two
ago
when
i
was
on
the
pier
at
bournemouth
i
plumped
myself
down
on
a
seat
near
to
g
who
although
never
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
i
was
uncommonly
glad
to
meet
under
the
circumstances
but
last
year
i
was
unusually
lucky
chancing
to
find
a
passenger
on
the
same
boat
as
myself
harry
o
moore
one
of
my
very
best
chums
from
whom
i
learned
the
following
story
you
must
know
he
began
as
we
sat
on
deck
watching
the
lofty
outlines
of
david
s
head
slowly
fade
in
the
distance
you
must
know
o
donnell
that
after
leaving
crawley
s
i
inherited
a
nice
little
sum
of
money
from
my
aunt
lady
maughan
of
blackrock
who
dying
quite
unexpectedly
left
the
bulk
of
her
property
to
my
family
my
brother
bob
had
her
estate
in
roscommon
charley
the
house
near
dublin
whilst
i
lucky
beggar
that
i
am
for
i
was
head
over
heels
in
debt
at
the
time
suddenly
found
myself
the
happy
possessor
of
and
a
grandfather
here
i
thought
fit
to
interrupt
a
clock
i
exclaimed
good
gracious
me
what
a
funny
legacy
had
you
taken
a
fancy
to
it
i
had
never
even
seen
it
o
moore
laughed
then
looking
suddenly
serious
my
aunt
o
donnell
as
i
daresay
you
recollect
was
rather
dry
and
satirical
the
clock
has
not
been
exactly
a
pleasant
acquisition
to
my
establishment
so
i
fancy
she
may
have
bequeathed
it
to
me
as
a
sort
of
antidote
to
the
exhilarating
effect
of
a
sort
of
bitter
with
the
sweet
don
t
you
know
you
appear
astonished
you
would
like
to
hear
more
about
the
clock
and
you
are
quite
right
too
the
history
of
a
really
antique
piece
of
furniture
is
a
million
times
more
interesting
a
subject
to
discuss
than
a
ton
of
gold
to
begin
with
it
was
almost
as
new
to
my
aunt
as
to
me
she
had
only
had
it
a
week
before
she
died
and
during
that
brief
interval
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
it
to
me
odd
was
it
not
i
thought
so
too
at
her
funeral
now
it
seems
quite
natural
i
was
her
metaphysician
i
knew
her
and
understood
her
idiosyncrasies
better
than
most
people
she
bought
the
clock
for
a
mere
song
from
a
furniture
dealer
in
grafton
street
i
was
living
at
the
time
near
basingstoke
in
a
small
house
one
of
those
horrible
anachronisms
an
villa
in
an
village
it
s
a
charming
neighbourhood
suited
me
down
to
the
ground
flat
country
hills
tire
me
to
death
excellent
roads
i
am
fond
of
riding
trout
streams
pretty
meadows
crowds
of
honeysuckle
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
to
crown
all
else
pines
now
if
there
is
one
scent
for
which
i
have
a
special
weakness
it
is
that
of
the
pine
i
could
sit
out
of
doors
sniffing
pines
it
intoxicates
me
hence
i
grew
very
fond
of
hampshire
let
me
return
to
the
clock
it
came
from
dublin
to
bristol
the
good
old
argo
what
bristolian
is
there
i
should
like
to
know
who
doesn
t
love
the
argo
and
thence
by
rail
to
basingstoke
arriving
at
my
house
after
dusk
you
see
i
am
talking
of
it
almost
as
if
it
were
some
live
person
but
then
you
see
it
was
a
grandfather
s
clock
no
common
grinder
i
can
assure
you
and
i
was
prepared
to
pay
it
every
homage
the
moment
it
was
landed
in
the
hall
the
carter
however
was
by
no
means
so
enamoured
of
it
he
was
a
rough
churlish
fellow
what
british
workmen
is
not
if
you
take
my
advice
mister
he
growled
you
ll
pitch
the
himpish
thing
in
some
one
helse
s
garden
how
characteristic
of
the
charitable
briton
i
gently
rebuked
the
irate
man
of
course
he
could
afford
to
be
more
prodigal
with
his
belongings
than
i
with
evident
haste
and
still
muttering
angrily
he
went
and
i
i
called
to
my
housekeeper
partridge
and
we
examined
the
heirloom
together
it
certainly
was
a
most
imposing
piece
of
furniture
standing
at
least
eight
feet
high
with
a
face
large
in
proportion
it
towered
above
me
like
a
giant
negro
black
i
can
t
describe
to
you
how
black
black
as
ebony
and
shining
i
asked
partridge
how
she
liked
it
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
there
was
something
so
indefinably
queer
about
it
that
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
carter
had
spoken
the
truth
it
is
truly
magnificent
she
said
running
her
hand
over
its
polished
surface
i
have
never
seen
so
fine
a
piece
of
workmanship
it
will
be
the
making
of
this
hall
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
hearse
we
laughed
the
analogy
was
simply
ludicrous
a
grandfather
s
clock
and
a
hearse
but
then
it
told
the
time
and
time
is
sometimes
represented
in
the
guise
of
death
father
death
with
the
sickle
my
laughter
left
me
and
i
shivered
we
placed
the
clock
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
opposite
the
front
door
so
that
every
one
coming
to
the
house
could
see
it
and
as
we
anticipated
it
was
much
admired
so
much
admired
in
fact
that
i
became
quite
jealous
jealous
and
of
a
clock
how
very
singular
but
then
i
recollected
i
was
engaged
and
of
course
i
resented
my
taking
notice
of
any
one
or
anything
save
myself
like
all
the
other
visitors
however
she
never
passed
by
the
clock
without
pausing
to
look
at
it
i
can
t
help
it
she
whispered
it
s
its
size
it
s
stupendous
it
quite
fills
the
house
there
is
hardly
any
room
to
breathe
it
s
a
monstrous
clock
it
fascinates
me
it
s
more
than
a
clock
you
must
get
rid
of
avice
was
whimsical
what
get
rid
of
the
ebony
clock
impossible
the
idea
tickled
me
i
laughed
i
laughed
then
but
not
later
when
she
had
gone
and
all
was
quiet
from
the
hall
below
i
heard
it
strike
one
two
three
twelve
its
pendulum
swung
to
and
fro
with
a
dull
and
ponderous
clang
and
the
sound
that
came
from
its
brazen
lungs
though
loud
and
deep
and
musical
was
far
too
thrilling
against
my
will
it
made
me
think
and
my
thoughts
were
none
too
pleasant
hardly
had
its
vibrations
ceased
before
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
at
first
i
attributed
the
noise
i
had
heard
to
the
pulsations
of
my
heart
bump
bump
bump
but
as
i
crouched
there
waiting
i
was
soon
undeceived
the
sounds
not
only
increased
in
intensity
but
drew
nearer
bump
bump
bump
just
as
if
something
huge
and
massive
was
moving
across
the
hall
floor
and
ascending
the
stairs
an
icy
fear
stole
all
over
me
what
what
in
heaven
s
name
could
it
be
i
glanced
in
terror
at
the
door
it
was
locked
locked
and
bolted
the
village
was
much
frequented
by
tramps
and
i
always
went
to
bed
prepared
but
this
noise
this
series
of
heavy
mechanical
booms
this
could
never
be
attributed
to
any
burglar
it
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
it
pounded
down
the
passage
leading
to
my
room
and
then
with
the
most
terrific
crash
it
fell
against
my
door
i
was
spellbound
petrified
i
dared
not
i
could
not
move
it
was
the
clock
the
gigantic
monstrous
clock
the
funereal
hideous
clock
i
heard
it
ticking
the
suspicions
that
i
entertained
all
along
with
regard
to
it
were
now
confirmed
it
lived
that
was
no
ordinary
striking
this
was
no
ordinary
ticking
the
thing
breathed
it
spoke
it
laughed
laughed
in
some
diabolically
ghoulish
manner
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
house
and
fortune
to
have
been
able
to
reach
the
bell
i
could
not
i
could
do
nothing
but
sit
there
listening
listening
to
its
mocking
voice
the
minutes
passed
by
slowly
never
had
i
had
the
leisure
to
count
them
with
such
painful
accuracy
for
the
tickings
though
of
equal
duration
varied
most
alarmingly
in
intonation
this
horrible
farce
lasted
without
cessation
till
one
when
apparently
convinced
of
its
inability
to
gain
admittance
it
gave
an
extra
loud
and
emphatic
clang
and
took
its
departure
in
the
morning
it
was
standing
as
usual
in
its
corner
in
the
hall
nor
could
i
detect
the
slightest
evidences
of
animation
neither
in
its
glassy
face
nor
in
its
sepulchral
tone
happening
to
pass
by
at
that
instant
partridge
surprised
me
in
my
act
of
examination
and
from
her
ashy
cheeks
and
frightened
glances
i
concluded
she
too
had
heard
the
noises
and
had
rightly
guessed
their
origin
nor
was
i
mistaken
for
on
putting
a
few
leading
questions
to
her
she
reluctantly
admitted
she
had
heard
everything
but
she
whispered
i
have
kept
it
from
the
maids
for
if
once
they
get
hold
of
the
idea
the
house
is
haunted
they
will
leave
unfortunately
her
circumspection
proved
of
no
avail
night
after
night
the
clock
repeated
its
vagaries
bumping
on
the
staircases
and
passages
to
such
a
degree
that
the
noise
not
only
awakened
the
entire
household
but
aroused
general
suspicion
nor
were
its
attentions
any
longer
restricted
to
me
it
gradually
extended
the
length
of
its
wanderings
till
every
part
of
the
house
had
been
explored
and
every
door
visited
the
maids
now
complained
to
me
they
could
not
do
their
work
they
argued
if
they
were
deprived
of
sleep
and
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
whilst
the
disturbances
continued
i
must
get
rid
of
the
to
this
proposition
however
i
was
by
no
means
agreeable
i
certainly
had
no
reason
to
like
the
clock
indeed
i
loathed
and
hated
it
but
in
some
indefinable
manner
it
fascinated
me
i
could
not
i
dare
not
part
with
it
i
have
no
doubt
i
protested
the
annoyances
will
cease
as
soon
as
the
clock
has
become
at
home
with
its
surroundings
have
patience
and
all
will
be
they
agreed
to
wait
a
little
longer
before
giving
me
notice
and
i
fully
hoped
that
my
prophecy
would
be
fulfilled
but
the
clock
was
far
more
persistent
than
i
had
anticipated
adopting
fresh
tactics
it
began
a
series
of
persecutions
that
speedily
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
christina
the
cook
was
the
first
victim
not
being
a
very
fluent
scribe
her
letters
caused
her
endless
labour
and
she
often
sat
up
writing
long
after
the
other
servants
had
gone
to
bed
on
the
night
in
question
she
was
plodding
on
wearily
when
the
intense
stillness
of
the
house
made
her
suddenly
think
of
the
time
it
must
be
very
late
dare
she
venture
in
the
hall
christina
was
not
a
nervous
woman
she
had
hitherto
discredited
all
and
was
quite
the
last
person
in
the
house
to
accept
the
theory
that
the
present
disturbances
were
due
to
any
superphysical
agency
she
now
however
recollected
all
that
had
been
said
on
the
subject
and
the
close
proximity
of
the
clock
filled
her
with
dread
her
fears
being
further
augmented
by
the
knowledge
of
her
isolation
unluckily
her
room
was
completely
cut
off
from
any
other
in
the
house
hastily
putting
away
her
writing
materials
she
was
preparing
to
make
a
precipitate
rush
for
the
stairs
when
a
peculiar
thumping
riveted
her
attention
her
blood
congealed
her
legs
tottered
she
could
not
move
an
inch
what
was
it
her
heart
only
the
pulsations
of
her
heart
she
burst
out
laughing
how
truly
ridiculous
catching
her
breath
and
casting
fearful
looks
of
apprehension
on
all
sides
she
advanced
towards
the
stairs
and
tiptoeing
stealthily
across
the
hall
tried
in
vain
to
keep
her
eyes
from
the
clock
but
its
sonorous
ticking
brought
her
to
a
peremptory
halt
she
stood
and
listened
tick
tick
tick
it
was
so
unlike
any
other
ticking
she
had
ever
heard
it
appalled
her
the
clock
too
seemed
to
have
become
blacker
and
even
more
gigantic
it
reared
itself
above
her
like
a
monstrous
coffin
she
was
now
too
terrified
to
think
of
escape
and
could
only
clutch
hold
of
the
bannisters
in
momentary
terror
of
some
fresh
phenomenon
in
this
helpless
condition
she
watched
the
clock
slowly
increase
in
stature
till
its
grotesquely
carved
summit
all
but
swept
the
ceiling
whilst
a
pair
of
huge
toeless
grey
feet
protruded
from
beneath
its
base
nor
were
these
the
only
changes
for
during
their
accomplishment
others
of
an
equally
alarming
nature
had
taken
place
and
the
ticking
after
having
passed
through
many
transitional
stages
was
now
replaced
by
a
spasmodic
breathing
forcibly
suggestive
of
something
devilish
and
bestial
at
this
juncture
words
can
not
convey
any
idea
of
what
christina
suffered
nor
had
she
seen
the
worst
midnight
at
length
came
in
dumb
agony
she
watched
the
slowly
make
its
last
circuit
there
were
twelve
frantic
clangs
the
door
concealing
the
pendulum
flew
open
and
an
enormous
hand
ashy
grey
with
long
fingers
made
a
convulsive
grab
at
her
swinging
to
one
side
she
narrowly
avoided
capture
and
glancing
upwards
saw
something
so
diabolically
awful
that
her
heart
turned
to
ice
in
the
march
number
of
the
research
for
a
instance
is
given
of
a
poltergeist
s
hand
being
seen
on
a
pillow
a
long
hand
with
knotty
the
face
of
the
clock
had
disappeared
and
in
its
place
christina
saw
a
frightful
head
grey
and
evil
it
was
very
large
and
round
half
human
half
animal
and
wholly
beastly
with
abnormally
long
lidless
eyes
of
pale
blue
that
leered
at
the
affrighted
girl
in
the
most
sinister
manner
such
a
creature
must
have
owed
its
origin
to
hell
for
some
seconds
she
stared
at
it
too
enthralled
with
horror
even
to
breathe
and
then
a
sudden
movement
on
its
part
breaking
the
spell
she
regained
control
over
her
limbs
and
fled
for
her
life
christina
reported
all
this
to
me
the
next
morning
she
had
narrowly
escaped
capture
by
darting
through
the
front
door
which
some
one
fortunately
for
her
had
forgotten
to
bolt
she
had
not
returned
to
the
house
but
had
instead
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
a
neighbouring
cottage
i
won
t
under
any
circumstances
sir
she
added
sleep
here
again
indeed
i
could
not
because
i
can
t
abide
the
presence
of
that
clock
i
shan
t
feel
easy
until
i
am
miles
away
from
it
in
some
big
town
where
the
bustle
and
noise
of
life
may
help
me
to
forget
it
forget
it
and
she
shuddered
partly
as
a
compensation
for
what
she
had
undergone
and
partly
to
avoid
a
scandal
i
presented
her
with
a
substantial
cheque
despite
partridge
s
pleadings
i
kept
the
clock
i
could
not
i
dare
not
part
with
it
it
was
my
aunt
s
bequest
it
fascinated
me
do
you
understand
o
donnell
it
fascinated
me
but
i
did
make
one
concession
i
permitted
them
to
remove
it
to
the
my
first
care
now
was
to
see
that
all
the
doors
were
locked
and
windows
bolted
before
retiring
to
bed
a
precaution
that
was
speedily
justified
for
the
next
few
nights
after
the
removal
of
the
clock
i
was
awakened
about
twelve
by
a
violent
ringing
of
the
front
door
bell
whilst
a
heavy
crunching
of
the
gravel
beneath
my
window
informed
me
our
persecutor
was
trying
to
gain
admittance
these
nocturnal
disturbances
ceasing
i
had
begun
to
congratulate
myself
upon
having
seen
the
last
of
the
hauntings
when
a
rumour
reached
me
that
the
clock
had
actually
begun
to
infest
the
more
lonely
of
the
lanes
and
nor
did
this
report
as
the
sequel
will
show
long
remain
unverified
my
uncle
john
a
rare
old
sport
came
to
stay
with
me
he
arrived
about
ten
and
we
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
when
the
vicar
of
the
parish
burst
into
our
presence
in
the
greatest
state
of
agitation
i
must
apologise
for
this
late
visit
he
gasped
sinking
into
an
easy
chair
i
couldn
t
get
here
before
indeed
i
did
not
intend
calling
this
evening
and
would
not
have
done
so
but
for
an
extraordinary
incident
that
has
just
happened
would
you
think
it
very
unclerical
if
i
were
to
ask
you
for
a
glass
of
neat
brandy
i
glanced
at
him
in
terror
his
blanched
cheeks
and
trembling
hands
told
their
own
tale
he
had
seen
the
clock
thanks
awfully
he
said
replacing
the
empty
glass
on
the
table
i
feel
better
now
but
by
jove
it
did
unnerve
me
let
me
tell
you
from
the
beginning
i
had
been
calling
at
gillet
s
farm
which
as
you
know
is
two
or
more
miles
from
here
and
the
night
being
fine
i
decided
to
go
home
by
the
fields
well
all
was
right
till
i
got
to
the
little
spinney
lying
at
the
foot
of
dickson
s
hollow
even
in
broad
daylight
i
always
feel
a
trifle
apprehensive
before
entering
it
as
it
is
often
frequented
by
tramps
and
other
doubtful
characters
in
fact
there
isn
t
a
more
murderous
looking
spot
in
the
county
all
was
so
still
so
unusually
still
i
thought
and
the
shadows
so
incomprehensible
that
i
had
half
a
mind
to
retrace
my
steps
but
disliking
to
appear
cowardly
and
remembering
i
must
confess
that
i
had
ordered
a
roast
duck
for
supper
i
climbed
the
wooden
fence
and
plunged
into
the
copse
at
every
step
the
silence
increased
the
cracking
of
twigs
under
my
feet
sounding
like
the
report
of
firearms
whilst
it
grew
so
dark
that
i
had
in
certain
places
literally
to
feel
my
way
when
about
halfway
through
the
wood
the
shrubs
that
line
the
path
on
either
side
abruptly
terminate
bringing
into
view
a
circle
of
sward
partially
covered
with
ferns
and
bracken
and
having
in
its
midst
a
stunted
willow
that
has
always
struck
me
as
being
peculiarly
out
of
place
there
indeed
i
was
pondering
over
this
incongruity
when
a
tall
figure
stalked
out
from
behind
the
tree
and
gliding
swiftly
forward
took
to
the
path
ahead
of
me
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
stared
in
amazement
and
no
doubt
you
will
think
me
mad
when
i
tell
you
the
figure
was
nothing
what
was
it
then
an
anthropoid
ape
my
uncle
john
laughed
the
vicar
shook
his
head
solemnly
i
will
describe
it
to
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
he
said
to
begin
with
it
was
naked
stark
staring
naked
how
positively
indecent
murmured
uncle
john
really
vicar
i
don
t
wonder
you
were
and
then
the
vicar
continued
disregarding
the
interruption
it
was
grey
from
head
to
foot
a
uniform
livid
a
grey
monstrosity
ah
now
that
is
interesting
i
looked
at
my
uncle
quizzically
was
he
still
joking
but
no
he
was
in
sober
earnest
could
it
be
possible
he
knew
anything
about
the
clock
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
smiled
feebly
in
height
the
vicar
went
on
it
could
not
have
been
far
from
seven
feet
it
had
an
enormous
round
head
crowned
with
a
black
mass
of
shock
hair
no
ears
huge
hands
and
toeless
feet
i
could
not
see
its
face
as
its
back
was
turned
on
me
urged
on
by
an
irresistible
impulse
although
half
dead
with
terror
i
followed
the
thing
striding
noiselessly
along
it
left
the
spinney
and
crossing
several
fields
entered
your
grounds
by
the
gate
in
the
rear
of
the
what
my
uncle
roared
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
what
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
allowed
it
to
come
here
i
couldn
t
stop
it
the
vicar
said
apologetically
stretching
forward
to
help
himself
to
some
more
brandy
it
led
me
to
your
vanishing
through
the
doorway
resolved
on
seeing
the
last
and
hoping
thereby
to
discover
some
clue
to
the
mystery
i
cautiously
approached
the
window
and
peering
through
the
glass
saw
the
creature
walk
stealthily
across
the
floor
and
disappear
into
a
gigantic
clock
i
verily
believe
i
was
as
much
scared
by
the
sight
of
that
clock
as
i
had
been
by
the
appearance
of
the
spectre
they
were
both
satanically
is
that
all
my
uncle
john
inquired
it
is
the
vicar
replied
and
is
it
not
enough
my
uncle
john
got
on
his
feet
before
returning
a
verdict
he
said
i
must
see
the
clock
let
us
go
to
the
at
the
vicar
and
i
were
loud
in
our
protests
we
were
sure
my
uncle
must
be
tired
better
put
off
the
investigation
to
the
it
was
however
of
no
avail
there
was
no
gainsaying
uncle
john
when
once
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
anything
we
accordingly
escorted
him
without
further
delay
to
the
garden
the
clock
was
standing
quite
peacefully
where
i
had
had
it
set
as
soon
as
my
uncle
saw
it
he
caught
hold
of
my
arm
where
on
earth
did
you
get
it
from
harry
he
cried
bubbling
over
with
excitement
the
last
time
i
saw
that
clock
was
in
kleogh
castle
the
home
of
the
blakes
it
had
been
in
their
possession
for
centuries
and
was
made
from
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
oldest
in
ireland
ah
the
old
lady
left
it
you
did
she
and
you
say
she
got
it
from
kelly
s
in
grafton
street
come
that
explains
everything
the
blakes
poor
beggars
were
sold
up
last
year
and
kelly
s
i
know
were
represented
at
the
sale
but
now
comes
the
extraordinary
part
of
the
affair
the
grey
figure
our
friend
the
vicar
has
just
described
to
us
tallies
exactly
with
the
phantasm
that
used
to
haunt
kleogh
and
which
the
blakes
have
always
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
family
ghost
now
it
would
appear
that
they
are
entirely
wrong
that
it
is
with
the
clock
and
not
kleogh
this
apparition
is
connected
a
fact
that
is
not
at
all
surprising
when
we
come
to
consider
its
origin
and
the
vast
antiquity
of
its
frame
but
let
us
examine
it
more
carefully
we
did
so
and
discovered
that
the
frontal
pillars
on
either
side
of
the
face
of
the
clock
consisted
of
two
highly
polished
which
although
blackened
through
countless
ages
of
immersion
in
the
bog
and
abnormally
long
as
is
inevitably
the
case
with
paleolithic
man
were
very
unmistakably
human
i
returned
the
clock
anonymously
to
kelly
a
solution
as
to
the
nature
of
this
type
of
ghost
will
appear
in
a
subsequent
volume

bath
is

its
grey
and
venerable

it
is
for
its
size
the
most
psychic
town
in
england
i
say
this
because
i
have
at
my
elbow
no
less
than
well
authenticated
stories
of
haunted
houses
in
this
city
a
collection
that
is
numerically
superior
to
that
of
any
other
town
in
england
saving
london
and
to
the
ghosts
of

there
is
as
i
stated
at
my
recent
lecture
in
chandos
street
no
end
positively
no
end
one
evening
last
january
i
read
a
paper
on
my
superphysical
experiences
before
an
extremely
intelligent
and
i
venture
to
say
appreciative
audience
of
theosophists
at
their
headquarters
argyll
street
bath
among
the
number
was
a
gentleman
quite
a
stranger
i
believe
who
gave
me
his
card
and
asked
me
to
call
on
him
next
day
i
did
so
and
in
the
course
of
a
very
entertaining
chat
he
narrated
to
me
the
following
story
some
years
ago
some
friends
of
mine
named
hartley
took
a
house
in
park
street
which
as
you
may
know
is
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
the
house
suited
them
it
was
warm
dry
and
in
a
very
tolerable
state
of
repair
it
was
also
in
a
quiet
and
thoroughly
respectable
part
of
the
town
and
the
rent
was
low
ridiculously
low
so
low
indeed
that
they
began
to
wonder
why
it
was
so
low
anxious
to
find
out
if
their
neighbours
were
equally
fortunate
in
the
matter
of
rent
they
made
enquiries
and
learned
to
their
astonishment
that
every
other
house
in
the
row
was
let
at
more
than
double
the
price
of
theirs
why
was
this
was
their
landlord
a
philanthropist
a
carnegie
a
madman
or
what
or
did
the
house
contain
some
subtle
flaw
they
were
yet
to
discover
to
their
disadvantage
perhaps
very
much
to
their
disadvantage
for
they
were
sufficiently
worldly
to
discredit
sentiment
in
business
getting
on
the
track
of
former
tenants
they
plied
them
with
cautious
questions
it
was
of
no
avail
the
bait
did
not
take
they
could
ascertain
nothing
then
they
gave
up
and
the
truth
at
last
leaked
out
one
dreary
afternoon
in
a
particularly
dreary
november
i
believe
it
was
the
fourth
of
november
the
rev
silas
wetherby
vicar
of
an
adjoining
parish
called
on
them
they
were
delighted
to
see
him
hartley
was
fond
of
the
clergy
her
father
and
uncles
and
brothers
were
all
in
the
church
she
had
lived
in
a
clerical
atmosphere
from
the
day
she
was
born
but
the
rev
silas
wetherby
puzzled
her
had
he
been
a
deacon
a
or
a
newly
ordained
curate
she
would
have
passed
him
over
as
excusably
shy
but
he
was
too
old
a
stager
for
that
why
did
he
puzzle
her
then
he
was
orthodox
urbane
and
she
would
stake
her
handkerchief
no
small
tatler
of
ecclesiastical
gossip
but
yet
there
was
something
amiss
with
him
something
that
made
him
pause
something
that
made
him
fidget
probably
she
never
would
have
found
out
why
he
behaved
in
such
an
odd
manner
but
for
an
unexpected
occurrence
without
even
as
much
as
a
rap
bobby
their
youngest
boy
who
is
as
a
rule
very
shy
before
visitors
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
he
was
pale
with
excitement
oh
do
come
mummy
he
cried
there
is
such
a
queer
old
man
in
such
a
quaint
dress
on
the
staircase
he
is
coughing
horribly
i
fancy
he
must
be
very
sick
do
come
mummy
mr
wetherby
s
behaviour
was
now
odd
in
the
extreme
half
rising
from
his
seat
and
trembling
all
over
he
pointed
his
finger
violently
at
the
door
run
away
little
man
he
said
run
away
no
one
is
coughing
now
your
invalid
has
recovered
he
is
gone
go
directly
and
shut
the
door
behind
you
mind
shut
the
door
and
keep
clear
of
the
staircase
and
bobby
completely
at
a
loss
what
to
make
of
this
despotic
stranger
beat
a
hasty
retreat
mrs
hartley
disregarding
the
pleading
look
from
her
husband
was
about
to
expostulate
like
the
majority
of
modern
mothers
her
tender
might
i
add
unsound
sensibilities
could
not
bear
to
see
her
offspring
treated
in
any
but
the
most
deferential
manner
the
rev
silas
however
forestalled
her
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
that
was
as
eloquent
as
it
was
peremptory
he
completely
took
the
wind
out
of
her
sails
and
before
she
had
time
to
recover
from
her
surprise
he
had
commenced
for
heaven
s
sake
hartley
he
said
in
a
leaning
forward
in
such
a
manner
as
emphasised
the
mysterious
air
he
had
suddenly
assumed
for
heaven
s
sake
leave
this
house
as
quickly
as
you
can
there
now
arthur
hartley
exclaimed
the
angry
expression
in
her
eyes
being
replaced
by
a
mixture
of
triumph
and
curiosity
there
now
didn
t
i
tell
you
all
along
something
was
wrong
with
the
place
drains
i
suppose
her
husband
said
mournfully
drains
or
rats
and
i
do
hate
neither
one
nor
the
other
the
rev
silas
whispered
no
the
house
is
at
this
announcement
hartley
gave
a
slight
ejaculation
of
terror
an
ejaculation
which
reduced
to
its
constituent
parts
might
be
found
to
consist
of
affectation
fear
and
no
small
amount
of
pleasure
the
latter
engendered
by
the
glamour
of
something
both
enigmatical
and
fashionable
what
s
it
haunted
by
teapots
hartley
muttered
with
a
contemptuous
movement
of
his
mouth
if
it
s
not
haunted
by
teapots
now
it
will
be
some
day
for
that
new
maid
of
yours
my
dear
is
always
breaking
them
she
has
smashed
two
since
yesterday
and
if
you
examine
this
one
closely
you
will
observe
that
the
spout
is
already
mrs
hartley
puckered
her
dainty
brows
into
the
most
alarming
frown
really
arthur
how
mundane
you
are
she
remarked
loftily
then
turning
to
wetherby
my
husband
is
as
you
see
one
of
those
solid
individuals
who
believes
in
nothing
till
he
sees
and
not
always
then
arthur
murmured
gazing
intently
at
the
parson
as
the
latter
was
about
to
pour
the
contents
of
the
into
his
cup
everything
that
appears
to
the
eye
white
and
sticky
is
not
cream
some
animals
have
brains
even
pigs
and
some
dairymen
are
frauds
most
of
them
good
gracious
me
the
rev
silas
cried
hastily
replacing
the
jug
you
surely
don
t
mean
to
insinuate
he
doesn
t
mean
anything
hartley
interrupted
with
considerable
impatience
he
is
unusually
silly
this
afternoon
so
pray
excuse
him
and
with
the
regular
accent
revenons
à
nos
moutons
s
il
vous
plait
i
am
anxious
to
hear
about
the
mr
wetherby
looked
a
trifle
sulky
he
fought
shy
of
sceptics
and
he
no
longer
enjoyed
his
tea
now
mind
i
don
t
ask
you
to
believe
me
he
began
although
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
this
parish
who
will
confirm
what
i
say
but
eighty
or
a
hundred
or
so
years
ago
a
son
poisoned
his
father
in
this
very
house
the
manner
of
the
poisoning
was
quite
orthodox
arsenic
in
apple
dumplings
there
have
been
many
parallel
cases
chiefly
i
believe
in
liverpool
arsenic
being
an
irritant
causes
considerable
vomiting
hence
the
old
man
must
have
had
several
attacks
of
sickness
prior
to
the
one
that
terminated
his
existence
as
he
was
travelling
downstairs
to
fetch
a
doctor
he
died
it
is
said
in
excruciating
agony
on
the
landing
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
and
it
is
his
ghost
that
haunts
the
house
hartley
hazarded
the
rev
gentleman
nodded
just
so
he
said
and
it
was
this
apparition
undoubtedly
that
your
little
boy
saw
just
now
it
always
appears
on
november
the
anniversary
of
the
murder
and
wetherby
was
going
to
add
something
that
judging
from
the
increased
solemnity
of
his
voice
would
have
been
very
impressive
when
hartley
cut
in
then
at
all
events
we
shall
have
a
reprieve
a
year
s
undisputed
possession
subject
to
no
interference
on
the
part
of
the
spook
whatever
s
his
he
laughed
irreverently
you
certainly
won
t
catch
me
giving
up
this
lease
for
any
so
immaterial
a
reason
no
thank
you
i
can
not
get
as
good
a
bargain
as
this
every
day
in
the
week
the
rev
silas
rose
to
go
very
well
then
he
said
bowing
stiffly
i
could
say
more
but
i
won
t
i
am
sorry
i
have
said
as
much
some
sceptics
are
never
convinced
some
sceptics
do
not
wish
to
be
convinced
some
sceptics
may
be
convinced
but
prefer
to
appear
unconvinced
i
am
no
metaphysician
i
will
not
attempt
to
classify
you
i
will
only
say
may
you
never
be
i
trust
hartley
at
all
events
is
not
a
sceptic
i
hope
she
is
not
a
psychic
especially
not
a
psychic
in
this
house
i
wish
you
good
day
he
did
not
wish
us
good
luck
hartley
explained
as
the
door
banged
by
jove
i
have
no
patience
to
listen
to
such
stuff
haunted
indeed
but
his
wife
shook
her
head
scepticism
is
one
thing
and
what
bobbie
saw
is
another
she
argued
you
can
t
get
over
that
arthur
now
are
we
doing
the
right
thing
for
the
children
in
remaining
here
in
all
matters
concerning
her
children
hartley
s
instincts
were
always
acute
one
or
two
of
them
were
babies
even
younger
than
bobbie
on
this
occasion
however
hartley
held
his
own
bobbie
he
reasoned
must
have
had
the
daymare
and
even
if
he
did
see
anything
no
harm
has
come
of
it
you
must
recollect
my
dear
he
observed
that
i
have
not
been
doing
on
the
stock
exchange
lately
moving
is
a
costly
thing
and
if
i
spend
money
in
one
way
i
must
recoup
in
another
which
means
no
new
dress
for
you
and
no
for
the
the
validity
of
this
logic
was
not
lost
upon
hartley
she
reflected
and
then
with
her
customary
adroitness
gave
a
turn
to
the
conversation
it
was
once
again
november
the
fourth
of
november
and
the
staircase
incident
of
a
year
ago
now
seemed
remote
and
improbable
it
was
however
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
both
and
hartley
though
they
both
pretended
to
have
forgotten
it
they
had
neither
seen
wetherby
again
nor
had
they
mentioned
the
appearance
of
the
ghost
to
anyone
it
was
really
of
so
little
consequence
it
was
a
wet
afternoon
wet
and
chilly
and
as
neither
or
hartley
had
any
particular
inducement
to
face
the
elements
they
decided
to
stay
indoors
hartley
reclining
in
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
whilst
her
husband
seated
himself
in
like
manner
before
a
blazing
hearth
in
the
they
tried
to
read
they
could
not
they
tried
to
sleep
they
could
not
and
somehow
they
felt
that
they
ought
to
go
and
look
at
the
children
but
they
would
not
and
so
they
whiled
away
the
hours
in
this
and
wholly
unsatisfactory
manner
it
seems
the
sudden
opening
of
the
nursery
door
first
disturbed
hartley
and
fancying
she
heard
someone
steal
gently
across
the
landing
she
called
out
there
was
no
reply
so
thinking
it
was
fancy
she
was
about
to
settle
down
again
when
the
sound
of
some
one
coughing
made
her
heart
beat
quickly
who
could
it
be
not
the
nurse
the
nurse
wouldn
t
cough
in
such
a
deep
and
hoarse
manner
nor
yet
arthur
she
would
recognise
his
cough
anywhere
hark
there
it
was
again
cough
cough
cough
just
as
if
some
one
was
being
sick
someone
being
sick
ah
who
could
that
someone
be
who
indeed
but
and
fearing
lest
one
of
the
children
might
be
on
the
stairs
she
overcame
a
momentary
weakness
and
sallied
forth
what
she
saw
froze
her
with
horror
at
the
top
of
the
hall
staircase
was
the
figure
of
a
man
clad
in
the
costume
of
the
eighteenth
century
long
maroon
with
vest
to
match
knee
breeches
and
coarse
yellow
stockings
hartley
couldn
t
see
his
face
as
he
was
in
a
recumbent
position
and
vomiting
horribly
looking
up
at
him
from
below
her
eyes
big
with
pity
and
wonder
not
fear
was
kitty
the
hartley
s
youngest
child
catching
sight
of
her
mother
kitty
cried
oh
mummy
do
tum
down
the
poor
man
is
awful
do
help
him
i
ll
tum
too
and
suiting
the
action
to
her
words
the
little
mite
prepared
to
ascend
no
sooner
however
had
she
set
a
foot
on
the
staircase
than
the
old
man
slipped
and
falling
sideways
plunged
through
the
air
making
sure
kitty
would
be
hurt
and
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
was
merely
clutching
at
a
phantom
hartley
appears
to
have
made
frantic
efforts
to
stay
the
disaster
whether
in
her
agitation
she
tried
to
go
down
the
stairs
too
quickly
or
whether
in
her
anxiety
to
save
her
child
she
lost
her
head
and
simply
leaped
forward
it
is
impossible
to
say
she
herself
always
declares
that
the
stairs
collapsed
under
her
anyhow
she
fell
and
crashing
into
kitty
literally
crushed
the
life
out
of
her
hartley
found
mother
and
child
lying
together
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
although
he
saw
no
sign
of
any
apparition
he
is
no
longer
a
sceptic
his
wife
recovered
at
least
she
is
alive
though
i
am
told
some
internal
complaint
the
result
of
the
catastrophe
makes
her
long
for
death
some
months
after
kitty
s
burial
when
time
had
to
a
certain
extent
mollified
the
poignancy
of
suffering
caused
by
her
death
hartley
received
a
letter
of
condolence
from
the
rev
silas
wetherby
the
greater
portion
of
the
epistle
was
simply
a
formal
declaration
of
sympathy
but
the
concluding
lines
inasmuch
as
they
bear
on
the
haunting
are
worth
repeating
the
worthy
divine
wrote
as
follows
if
you
recollect
at
our
last
meeting
i
gave
you
to
understand
that
i
had
something
further
to
tell
you
the
occult
disturbances
in
your
late
abode
you
will
probably
treat
my
statement
with
contempt
badly
concealed
under
cover
of
a
pretty
pasquinade
but
i
am
prepared
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
your
scepticism
in
order
to
relieve
my
conscience
what
i
would
have
told
you
had
i
not
been
silenced
culpably
i
own
by
your
ridicule
is
this
the
appearance
of
the
sick
man
had
always
been
followed
by
some
dire
calamity
whenever
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
set
even
as
much
as
one
foot
on
the
staircase
during
the
manifestations
hence
my
warning
to
bobbie
i
can
not
of
course
explain
to
you
why
a
phenomenon
of
this
sort
should
entail
physical
disaster
any
more
than
i
can
elucidate
the
mystery
of
the
ghost
candles
of
wales
or
the
banshees
of
ireland
between
which
manifestations
and
the
phenomena
in
question
there
is
a
strong
analogy
but
should
you
feel
sufficiently
interested
in
the
subject
to
ask
for
further
information
or
even
be
sufficiently
dubious
to
demand
testimony
i
will
with
pleasure
provide
you
with
an
abundance
of
creditable
corroborations

dear
o
donnell
in
reply
to
your
inquiry
as
to
that
psychic
experience
i
had
in
devon
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
the
affair
explicit
although
as
you
know
very
well
i
do
not
pose
as
a
scribe
well
it
took
place
three
years
ago
june
shall
i
ever
forget
the
date
my
friends
the
maitlands
had
only
just
taken
the
minery
a
pretty
yellow
stone
villa
modern
in
every
respect
it
stood
some
few
yards
away
from
the
road
and
was
fronted
by
a
lawn
bordered
with
honeysuckle
and
devon
roses
i
tell
you
this
to
impress
upon
you
the
fact
that
there
was
positively
nothing
suggestive
of
ghosts
either
in
the
grounds
or
building
the
latter
being
as
unlike
the
orthodox
haunted
house
as
one
can
well
imagine
if
anything
should
have
warned
me
it
was
the
hesitating
and
half
nervous
manner
so
unlike
herself
with
which
dora
maitland
showed
me
my
room
i
do
hope
you
will
like
it
and
be
comfortable
dear
she
said
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
a
strangely
perplexing
expression
in
her
eyes
and
one
which
i
couldn
t
then
interpret
be
sure
to
tell
us
if
you
don
t
and
we
will
have
you
moved
at
why
shouldn
t
i
i
asked
in
unfeigned
astonishment
it
is
delightfully
snug
and
sunny
a
south
aspect
a
charming
view
and
oh
the
most
delightful
of
dainty
furniture
why
dora
i
should
indeed
be
an
ungrateful
sybarite
if
i
didn
t
revel
in
and
dora
forced
a
smile
the
hot
summer
days
drove
us
into
the
open
we
got
up
early
and
went
to
bed
late
being
a
man
and
fond
of
cricket
and
fishing
you
would
hardly
appreciate
the
life
we
led
we
are
women
of
the
old
school
and
consequently
spent
all
our
time
at
home
on
the
lawn
plying
our
needles
possibly
at
the
same
time
chewing
chocolates
or
discussing
our
favourite
books
motoring
and
golf
we
left
to
others
the
of
june
was
warm
and
sultry
we
had
been
invited
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
adjoining
vicarage
dora
had
a
headache
her
mother
was
a
chronic
invalid
and
so
i
went
alone
it
was
a
stupid
affair
mediocre
music
still
more
mediocre
supper
and
bridge
fancy
bridge
in
a
sleepy
country
parsonage
fancy
bridge
anywhere
i
hate
bridge
the
guests
were
of
the
usual
sort
prudish
prosy
and
plain
a
widow
and
twins
the
miss
somebodies
of
somewhere
a
curate
a
doctor
and
a
lawyer
what
with
the
exception
of
the
last
could
be
more
respectable
what
more
dull
deadly
dull
they
were
all
the
men
i
mean
very
anxious
i
should
play
cards
but
for
once
in
a
way
i
made
myself
positively
disagreeable
and
sat
alone
eleven
o
clock
came
it
was
time
to
go
i
rose
with
alacrity
omitting
i
believe
in
the
intensity
of
joy
the
formal
expressions
of
regret
the
vicar
accompanied
me
as
far
as
the
gates
bidding
me
a
bland
he
retraced
his
steps
with
a
sigh
of
relief
maitland
had
left
a
light
burning
in
the
hall
i
turned
it
out
and
taking
up
my
candle
proceeded
to
my
bedroom
and
was
beginning
to
undress
when
a
strange
thing
happened
my
bedroom
door
which
i
felt
positively
certain
i
had
locked
slowly
opened
and
a
man
peered
in
i
can
see
him
now
strong
regular
features
with
piercing
dark
and
somewhat
sinister
eyes
that
were
in
marked
contrast
to
the
brows
and
wavy
neatly
parted
hair
the
chin
was
square
the
head
well
shaped
he
was
a
handsome
man
yet
he
did
not
please
me
i
was
frightened
for
some
seconds
he
glanced
furtively
round
the
room
his
eyes
finally
resting
on
the
bedstead
which
he
regarded
in
a
manner
that
made
my
flesh
creep
who
could
he
be
what
on
earth
did
he
want
terrified
lest
he
should
see
me
though
why
it
was
he
hadn
t
done
so
i
couldn
t
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
i
kept
shrinking
backwards
backwards
into
the
alcove
where
i
hung
my
dresses
in
the
wild
hope
that
they
would
afford
me
a
safe
presently
to
my
unutterable
relief
he
disappeared
and
i
heard
his
footsteps
tiptoeing
gently
down
the
staircase
here
then
was
my
chance
of
escape
hardly
daring
to
breathe
i
rushed
frantically
to
the
door
heaven
preserve
me
it
was
locked
again
and
tearing
it
open
i
made
directly
for
the
passage
leading
to
dora
s
room
on
my
way
i
heard
a
noise
a
noise
that
fascinated
and
kept
me
still
the
clanging
of
a
bucket
what
could
a
man
be
doing
with
a
bucket
at
this
time
of
night
a
bucket
and
on
that
staircase
so
daintily
furnished
with
velvet
pile
breathlessly
i
watched
him
ascend
his
step
light
and
springing
his
head
bent
low
and
the
bucket
clanging
each
time
he
mounted
clang
clang
clang
the
agony
i
suffered
for
i
could
now
only
conclude
he
was
either
a
madman
or
burglar
was
indescribable
i
dreaded
above
all
things
the
act
of
being
seen
of
encountering
a
glance
from
those
evil
eyes
nearer
and
nearer
he
came
one
more
step
and
he
stood
on
the
little
lobby
outside
my
bedroom
door
what
was
he
going
to
do
to
enter
my
room
or
follow
me
my
heart
stood
still
a
cold
sweat
burst
out
all
over
me
i
essayed
to
shriek
and
implore
the
aid
of
dora
my
throat
dried
up
my
tongue
stuck
to
the
palate
of
my
mouth
i
was
speechless
helpless
hopeless
another
yard
and
the
uncanny
stranger
would
have
me
in
his
clutches
at
the
crucial
moment
heaven
heard
my
silent
prayer
he
halted
i
was
saved
with
one
hand
on
the
handle
he
slowly
very
slowly
opened
the
door
and
crouching
down
on
his
hands
and
feet
crept
quietly
in
muffling
the
sound
of
the
bucket
incongruous
sight
a
man
a
madman
or
a
burglar
with
a
common
an
bucket
and
in
the
ecstasies
of
salvation
i
gave
a
weak
hysterical
laugh
a
madman
with
a
bucket
and
what
a
bucket
after
this
little
display
of
emotion
and
being
now
in
the
full
possession
of
all
my
motive
faculties
i
promptly
fled
not
pausing
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
till
i
had
reached
the
bedside
of
dora
and
had
shaken
her
to
wakefulness
she
listened
to
my
story
with
blanched
cheeks
beseeching
me
with
terror
in
her
eyes
to
make
sure
the
door
was
locked
and
that
her
bible
was
well
in
evidence
her
fears
adding
to
my
own
for
i
now
concluded
that
there
was
some
horrible
mystery
attached
to
what
i
had
just
witnessed
i
hastily
scrambled
into
bed
and
drawing
the
clothes
well
over
our
heads
begged
her
to
confide
in
me
the
secret
i
hardly
know
how
to
explain
it
kate
she
whispered
you
will
be
so
shocked
and
i
m
afraid
you
will
blame
us
horribly
for
putting
you
in
that
room
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
had
nowhere
else
at
least
nowhere
suitable
as
the
ceilings
and
walls
are
sadly
out
of
repair
you
see
we
bought
this
house
at
a
very
low
price
it
had
stood
empty
for
a
good
many
months
was
in
a
sad
state
of
dilapidation
and
the
owner
was
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
it
after
we
had
settled
in
he
coolly
informed
us
that
it
was
reputed
to
be
haunted
that
the
remains
of
a
woman
had
been
found
under
the
cement
of
the
floor
it
is
now
nicely
tiled
and
that
on
the
anniversary
of
its
committal
the
tragedy
was
reported
to
be
in
all
its
grim
and
was
she
murdered
in
my
room
i
inquired
it
is
supposed
so
dora
murmured
there
is
a
stain
which
nothing
will
efface
under
the
carpet
and
former
tenants
are
reported
to
have
seen
all
you
have
witnessed
and
rather
and
the
murderer
what
of
him
i
asked
thinking
with
a
shudder
of
his
eyes
no
one
knows
anything
dora
whispered
edging
closer
to
me
as
we
heard
a
distant
clang
it
is
only
surmised
he
was
her
husband
she
was
quite
a
stranger
here
and
he
was
never
but
the
bucket
what
could
he
want
with
such
an
absurd
thing
as
a
bucket
and
as
i
heard
it
clanging
from
below
i
gave
a
ghastly
chuckle
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
laugh
dora
shivered
they
found
that
bucket
he
had
used
it
for
transporting
her
remains

remember
me
to
all
ever

the
following
story
was
related
to
me
by
miss
constance
delaunay
and
is
given
as
near
as
possible
in
her
own
words
the
early
spring
of
was
i
daresay
you
remember
exceptionally
fine
so
fine
indeed
that
my
mother
a
chronic
sufferer
from
rheumatism
determined
to
remain
in
england
instead
of
going
as
was
her
custom
to
the
riviera
we
did
not
want
however
to
stay
in
town
an
unusually
gay
christmas
having
given
us
an
appetite
for
the
country
so
we
our
flat
and
took
thurlow
hall
furnished
on
a
three
months
lease
we
had
never
been
to
devon
we
had
heard
much
of
its
beauty
we
were
disappointed
possibly
being
of
foreign
extraction
i
am
prejudiced
but
in
my
opinion
the
scenery
of
devon
is
almost
if
not
quite
as
inferior
to
that
of
belgium
and
switzerland
as
the
manners
of
its
peasants
are
inferior
to
those
of
the
corresponding
class
of
continentals
the
west
country
rustics
did
not
impress
us
favourably
on
our
arrival
they
welcomed
us
with
gapes
and
stares
and
boorish
grunts
not
a
few
of
them
giggled
whilst
others
slouching
up
to
our
boxes
read
the
labels
and
muttered
disparaging
things
about
foreigners
we
were
told
it
was
the
spirit
of
independence
a
spirit
presumably
fostered
by
the
democratic
teaching
of
the
board
school
which
if
it
had
accomplished
nothing
else
had
effectually
taught
the
children
to
be
rude
the
pretty
simplicity
and
deferential
mannerism
described
as
characteristics
of
these
villagers
by
writers
had
become
obsolete
courtseying
was
now
regarded
as
no
one
touched
their
hats
to
or
moved
aside
for
ladies
and
the
colloquial
sir
and
mam
had
long
since
given
place
to
a
familiar
and
condescending
or
as
the
case
might
be
in
cornwall
we
were
informed
the
manners
of
the
people
are
even
worse
and
if
that
is
a
fact
one
can
hardly
believe
it
possible
i
am
quite
certain
we
shall
never
cross
the
tamar
fortunately
we
had
taken
two
of
our
favourite
servants
with
us
namely
marie
and
eugenie
the
latter
my
mother
s
own
maid
a
capable
person
who
could
turn
her
hand
to
anything
the
former
a
clever
little
cook
we
had
imported
from
our
own
country
but
for
this
foresight
on
my
part
i
do
not
know
how
my
mother
could
have
managed
to
exist
she
is
even
more
fastidious
than
i
she
can
not
bear
anything
coarse
or
uncouth
in
comparison
a
local
servant
would
have
made
purgatory
seem
pleasant
i
am
afraid
you
will
conclude
we
are
rather
hard
to
please
perhaps
we
are
somewhat
exacting
but
we
can
not
help
it
we
are
women
of
the
old
school
may
i
add
of
gentle
birth
who
claim
to
the
full
all
the
privileges
of
our
sex
and
station
besides
we
offered
a
good
sum
for
the
house
we
expected
to
be
treated
fairly
according
to
the
advertisement
the
hall
was
furnished
it
was
in
reality
nothing
of
the
sort
can
any
house
in
which
there
is
neither
bookcase
nor
bathroom
be
said
to
be
furnished
though
standing
alone
on
a
fairly
large
piece
of
ground
i
can
not
truthfully
say
a
garden
it
might
well
have
been
called
for
we
searched
in
it
in
vain
to
find
a
whole
piece
of
furniture
marie
and
eugenie
are
smart
young
women
they
pride
themselves
on
being
slim
and
elegant
imagine
then
their
disgust
when
the
kitchen
chairs
actually
collapsed
under
them
i
too
had
a
grievance
without
conceit
i
may
say
that
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
be
clumsy
how
was
it
then
that
i
broke
three
cups
a
saucer
and
a
within
the
short
space
of
half
an
hour
the
reason
was
obvious
enough
the
cups
were
all
cracked
the
saucers
damaged
and
the
jugs
should
have
been
labelled
beware
of
the
even
moderately
disfigured
china
is
my
mother
s
pet
aversion
how
she
suffered
under
these
circumstances
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
but
the
plate
i
have
heard
of
gold
plate
silver
plate
copper
plate
brass
plate
and
electro
plate
but
with
none
of
these
could
i
associate
this
mongrel
species
these
odds
and
ends
we
were
called
upon
to
use
it
was
indeed
an
enigma
and
i
hate
enigmas
especially
when
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
of
solving
luckily
substitutes
were
easily
obtainable
i
wired
for
a
complete
supply
of
plate
from
home
after
which
the
motley
crew
of
hirelings
were
no
longer
in
evidence
and
the
carpets
i
have
always
thought
such
luxuries
even
the
most
costly
a
doubtful
blessing
these
were
undoubtedly
an
unmixed
evil
fortunately
we
were
able
to
dispense
with
them
the
floors
underneath
were
of
polished
oak
and
with
these
we
were
greatly
taken
true
we
were
somewhat
puzzled
to
account
for
certain
irregularities
in
the
boards
but
on
the
whole
i
think
we
should
have
been
more
astonished
had
we
found
them
intact
could
we
by
any
means
make
the
place
tenantable
marie
and
eugenie
are
brave
and
forgiving
girls
in
spite
of
their
recent
adventure
they
had
never
been
so
insulted
in
their
lives
they
thought
it
possible
mother
and
i
were
doubtful
we
hired
all
the
furniture
there
was
to
be
hired
from
the
village
we
engaged
by
the
day
the
only
prepossessing
and
respectable
woman
it
contained
and
we
tried
to
settle
down
and
pretend
we
enjoyed
it
from
the
beginning
it
was
a
fiasco
we
were
miserable
and
to
add
to
our
distress
or
rather
to
fill
to
overflowing
our
cup
of
misfortune
the
weather
became
miserable
too
it
began
to
rain
what
was
there
to
hope
for
now
nothing
what
was
there
to
do
now
nothing
nothing
but
sit
at
the
window
and
gaze
at
the
dreary
lawn
shut
off
from
the
road
by
a
hideous
wall
or
to
flit
about
from
room
to
room
wringing
one
s
hands
like
a
distracted
phantom
a
phantom
i
did
not
believe
in
phantoms
when
i
came
to
thurlow
i
treated
the
unknown
with
the
blind
levity
of
a
voltaire
i
was
inconsequently
sceptical
i
had
been
born
psychic
though
i
was
sublimely
unconscious
of
it
the
dawn
of
my
awakening
was
at
hand
though
the
house
was
undesirable
in
so
many
ways
cold
bare
comfortless
dilapidated
it
was
not
without
interest
it
was
old
old
with
the
antiquity
of
two
or
more
centuries
and
age
is
always
interesting
there
were
rooms
in
it
narrow
rectangular
rooms
darkened
by
virginian
creeper
that
dropped
their
crimson
foliage
over
diamond
panes
rooms
the
very
air
of
which
seemed
charged
with
the
shades
of
wits
and
in
my
imagination
the
house
had
once
been
a
school
the
severity
of
the
walls
the
coldness
of
their
neat
yellow
stones
suggested
it
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
fancy
i
could
discern
on
the
and
who
but
schoolboys
ever
desecrate
a
floor
with
the
predominating
feature
in
the
house
was
undoubtedly
the
staircase
it
was
the
first
thing
one
noticed
on
entering
there
was
no
escaping
it
confronting
the
door
in
the
very
middle
of
the
hall
it
stood
there
like
some
grey
and
massive
sentinel
and
barred
the
way
one
wondered
how
it
had
ever
got
there
it
was
so
disproportionately
large
for
the
house
it
was
masterful
aggressive
fascinating
marie
declared
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
that
it
lived
and
it
was
made
of
stone
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
now
the
hall
had
indeed
been
a
school
would
any
one
but
a
pedagogue
have
a
stone
staircase
eugh
my
mother
felt
a
twinge
of
rheumatism
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
it
it
was
curiously
wanting
in
proportion
consisting
of
barely
a
dozen
steps
it
was
most
uncomfortably
steep
and
of
a
most
unnecessary
width
i
compared
it
with
some
strange
squatting
animal
a
comparison
that
grew
on
me
the
longer
i
remained
in
the
house
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
was
a
gallery
protected
by
high
rails
which
i
discovered
connected
the
used
and
disused
portions
of
the
house
in
the
latter
there
were
some
rooms
we
did
not
care
to
inhabit
there
were
a
few
we
were
even
unable
to
explore
they
were
locked
i
felt
no
curiosity
about
them
they
were
certain
to
be
both
commonplace
prosaic
and
dusty
every
time
i
passed
them
i
smelt
dust
and
i
can
not
endure
a
particle
of
dust
if
i
had
believed
any
of
them
to
be
a
library
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
pick
the
lock
i
am
passionately
fond
of
books
that
is
to
say
of
some
books
when
i
am
exiled
in
the
country
and
it
is
always
raining
i
was
in
search
of
a
book
which
i
had
laid
down
somewhere
when
i
crossed
the
hall
one
afternoon
and
left
my
mother
dozing
in
a
big
armchair
before
the
fire
marie
said
she
had
seen
it
on
the
oak
settle
most
likely
for
i
often
took
my
book
and
lounged
on
it
you
see
i
had
grown
fond
of
the
oak
settle
naturally
for
it
was
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
that
monster
house
that
stirred
in
me
any
friendly
feeling
whatever
but
marie
must
have
been
dreaming
it
was
certainly
not
there
i
would
have
called
to
marie
to
come
and
help
me
search
for
it
had
i
not
remembered
that
she
and
eugenie
had
gone
into
the
village
to
do
a
little
shopping
on
their
own
account
they
laugh
in
their
grandest
manner
at
those
silly
little
shops
but
with
a
true
woman
s
instinct
they
can
not
resist
i
felt
indignant
provoked
angry
never
had
i
wanted
to
read
so
much
and
never
had
i
been
at
such
a
loss
to
find
a
book
oh
i
recollected
there
was
one
upstairs
an
ancient
and
musty
edition
of
eugene
aram
proof
positive
this
that
the
place
was
once
a
school
would
any
one
save
a
schoolmaster
read
eugene
aram
i
had
seen
it
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
disused
cupboard
alone
and
forsaken
a
solitary
relic
of
the
academical
bookshelf
were
i
in
a
library
eugene
aram
would
probably
be
the
last
book
i
would
choose
to
read
lytton
s
tales
are
horrible
i
abominate
horrors
i
thought
of
the
staircase
i
glanced
at
it
it
was
really
very
dark
i
shuddered
i
did
not
understand
why
i
shuddered
unless
it
was
on
account
of
a
draught
of
course
a
draught
the
house
was
full
of
draughts
the
hour
was
late
the
afternoon
was
cold
it
was
march
and
undoubtedly
a
door
was
open
somewhere
the
book
was
not
worth
the
trouble
i
was
i
would
return
to
my
mother
this
i
was
actually
preparing
to
do
when
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
light
made
me
pause
it
came
from
the
disused
wing
overhead
i
can
assure
you
i
wanted
very
much
to
go
to
my
mother
i
would
have
given
all
i
possessed
to
have
gone
to
my
mother
i
could
not
i
could
not
stir
that
light
enthralled
me
i
had
never
seen
such
a
light
such
a
queer
unaccountable
light
a
light
that
to
anyone
less
sceptical
might
have
seemed
an
unnatural
light
perhaps
it
was
an
unnatural
light
and
i
laughed
but
what
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
could
it
be
drawing
rapidly
nearer
and
quickly
assuming
the
appearance
and
proportions
of
a
fire
it
filled
me
with
the
most
unusual
the
most
preposterously
unusual
doubts
and
fears
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
detected
it
was
accompanied
by
incongruous
though
perfectly
intelligible
sound
the
sound
of
someone
tapping
with
all
their
might
tapping
with
a
pair
of
shoes
aghast
at
this
discovery
my
perplexities
increased
and
i
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
extricate
myself
from
a
chaotic
quagmire
of
unpleasant
thoughts
when
a
scream
the
very
intensity
of
which
made
me
tremble
echoed
and
throughout
the
house
fire
fire
bring
me
fire
these
words
apparently
so
strangely
paradoxical
were
repeated
with
renewed
vigour
and
anguish
the
voice
after
each
effort
dying
away
into
the
most
appalling
and
piteous
wail
the
screams
were
coming
nearer
but
before
i
had
time
to
realise
the
tumult
was
so
close
at
hand
or
to
fortify
myself
against
the
tableau
i
now
had
every
reason
to
anticipate
a
girl
her
hair
and
dress
a
mass
of
lurid
flames
came
rushing
frantically
into
the
gallery
the
spectacle
she
presented
was
so
satanically
awful
that
i
immediately
crossed
myself
an
indescribable
thrill
of
terror
ran
through
me
i
felt
i
knew
i
was
actually
in
the
presence
of
an
apparition
nothing
earthly
could
possibly
have
produced
a
similar
or
in
any
way
equivalent
effect
staring
at
me
through
the
yellow
inferno
of
flames
was
a
woman
s
face
that
despite
its
horribly
contorted
features
was
amazingly
and
uniquely
beautiful
the
perfect
regularity
of
the
jewish
lineaments
being
strikingly
enhanced
by
the
whiteness
of
the
teeth
the
blueness
of
the
eyes
the
latter
came
upon
me
as
a
further
shock
though
very
lovely
both
in
their
excessive
length
and
hue
they
did
not
match
that
style
of
face
to
have
done
so
they
should
have
been
black
or
brown
and
their
expression
was
repellent
i
say
repellent
i
might
with
great
accuracy
say
hellish
for
i
saw
in
them
the
mirror
of
a
sinful
soul
of
a
very
sinful
soul
i
could
form
no
idea
as
to
her
dress
the
blaze
effectually
hid
everything
save
her
face
but
from
the
partial
glimpse
i
caught
of
a
pair
of
satin
shoes
i
surmised
she
was
in
some
sort
of
costume
the
duration
of
her
transit
though
to
me
an
eternity
could
not
i
fancy
have
occupied
more
than
a
very
few
seconds
still
gazing
at
me
and
beating
the
air
with
its
hands
the
phantom
rushed
shrieking
onwards
disappearing
with
the
impetus
of
a
tornado
in
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
house
i
had
no
further
use
for
eugene
i
returned
to
my
mother
the
same
phenomena
was
witnessed
by
marie
and
eugenie
respectively
within
the
next
three
days
on
the
fourth
we
left
had
we
remained
there
might
have
been
a
fatality
we
were
all
genuinely
frightened
and
mother
is
an
invalid
a
very
nervous
invalid
perhaps
you
feel
inclined
to
say
it
was
all
a
matter
of
nerves
what
more
likely
we
were
an
isolated
quartet
of
women
or
you
might
say
that
some
story
we
had
heard
in
connection
with
the
house
suggested
these
occult
demonstrations
do
not
be
premature
we
only
heard
a
few
weeks
ago
that
the
hall
had
a
reputation
for
being
haunted
and
it
is
now
several
months
since
we
left
thurlow
our
informant
a
former
tenant
was
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
a
person
of
indisputable
veracity
and
common
sense
in
short
a
person
quite
incapable
of
inventing
any
such
story
as
the
following
which
he
kindly
narrated
for
our
satisfaction
it
appears
from
what
he
told
us
his
is
still
in
my
bureau
that
thurlow
hall
once
belonged
to
purvis
an
old
lady
with
one
child
charles
charles
was
of
course
the
apple
of
her
eye
charles
ruled
the
house
every
one
must
obey
charles
charles
could
do
nothing
wrong
nothing
wrong
until
in
the
heyday
of
his
youth
in
the
season
of
wild
oats
he
unexpectedly
fell
in
love
with
a
gaiety
girl
phyllis
no
one
remembered
her
other
name
and
married
her
and
that
was
very
wrong
his
mother
was
indignant
furious
not
with
charles
of
course
but
with
that
creature
phyllis
phyllis
had
inveigled
him
into
marrying
her
phyllis
would
bring
eternal
disgrace
on
the
family
phyllis
would
run
away
with
another
man
and
ruin
him
ruin
him
ruin
charles
and
the
fond
mother
grew
despondent
very
despondent
so
despondent
indeed
that
unkind
neighbours
said
she
was
mad
they
were
wrong
the
despondency
was
only
a
reaction
she
suddenly
cheered
up
all
was
apparently
forgiven
and
forgotten
charles
and
phyllis
were
invited
to
spend
christmas
at
thurlow
they
went
very
naturally
they
went
charles
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
displaying
the
purvis
estate
to
his
charming
wife
his
mother
welcomed
phyllis
effusively
she
made
her
feel
thoroughly
at
home
she
expressed
an
ardent
desire
to
see
her
in
her
bridal
robes
phyllis
consented
what
else
could
she
do
she
had
been
a
gaiety
girl
she
had
lived
for
admiration
arrayed
in
her
wedding
garments
she
entered
purvis
s
room
surprising
the
old
lady
in
the
act
of
lighting
an
oil
lamp
a
rather
shaky
old
lamp
filled
to
the
brim
with
oil
phyllis
was
radiant
her
sole
thought
was
of
the
sensation
she
would
create
at
the
coming
christmas
festivities
had
she
been
less
absorbed
she
might
have
noticed
how
the
hand
trembled
that
raised
the
lamp
she
might
even
have
been
on
her
guard
but
vanity
as
well
as
love
is
blind
phyllis
accepted
purvis
s
profuse
expressions
of
admiration
and
delight
in
good
faith
they
were
of
course
both
genuine
and
natural
they
were
moreover
her
due
the
bride
was
intent
on
examining
herself
in
the
mirror
her
approached
her
from
behind
and
bending
suddenly
forward
deliberately
hurled
the
lamp
on
to
the
train
of
her
dress
there
was
a
loud
crash
an
explosion
and
the
wedding
dress
was
on
fire
no
one
was
at
hand
to
render
assistance
charles
and
the
servants
having
been
slyly
inveigled
out
of
the
house
and
the
only
response
to
her
screams
were
loud
peals
of
laughter
from
her
now
wholly
insane
it
was
small
wonder
that
the
poor
girl
lost
her
head
and
craving
water
cried
in
her
agony
bring
me
fire
oh
bring
me
fire
in
that
mad
rush
from
the
room
along
the
disused
corridors
her
one
endeavour
would
appear
to
have
been
to
reach
her
bedroom
perhaps
she
had
forgotten
that
charles
had
gone
out
but
her
efforts
were
frustrated
by
the
fiendish
fury
of
the
flames
the
amount
of
oil
on
her
dress
must
have
made
it
blaze
like
a
furnace
she
had
barely
crossed
the
gallery
into
the
opposite
wing
of
the
house
before
her
scorched
and
smouldering
limbs
gave
way
and
falling
to
the
ground
she
was
speedily
burned
to
ashes
her
supreme
and
final
agony
being
summed
up
in
a
despairing
cry
so
loud
and
piercing
that
it
was
even
heard
outside
by
charles
not
daring
to
approach
the
house
alone
charles
summoned
some
villagers
and
keeping
well
in
their
rear
gingerly
accompanied
them
across
the
lawn
to
the
front
entrance
there
they
were
met
by
purvis
chuckling
horribly
corridors
gallery
and
staircase
were
in
flames
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
vicar
the
whole
place
would
have
been
consumed
thanks
however
to
his
vigour
and
the
fire
was
eventually
extinguished
and
although
the
damage
done
was
considerable
the
bulk
of
the
property
remained
unscathed
no
trace
of
the
unfortunate
charles
purvis
being
found
the
precise
manner
of
her
death
for
many
years
remained
a
mystery
but
the
erratic
babblings
of
her
supplied
material
for
certain
conjectures
which
were
afterwards
confirmed
by
the
lucid
and
exhaustive
confession
of
the
old
lady
who
regained
her
reason
on
her
deathbed
though
a
thorough
restoration
of
the
property
was
effected
charles
would
never
live
at
the
hall
a
long
series
of
unsatisfactory
tenancies
succeeded
the
events
i
have
just
related
and
the
story
of
a
ghost
has
at
length
come
to
stay
i
have
good
reason
for
believing
the
house
is
still
august
haunted
most
probably
this
will
always
be
the
the
guilsborough
ghost
or
a
minute
account
of
the
appearance
of
the
ghost
of
john
croxford
executed
at
northampton
august
for
the
murder
of
a
stranger
in
the
parish
of
guilsborough
printed
in
the
year
and
reprinted
by
cordeaux
northampton
the
different
styles
of
writing
in
the
following
are
due
to
certain
alterations
i
have
been
obliged
to
make
the
english
of
the
original
being
so
involved
in
places
as
to
be
nearly
unintelligible
part

the

from
which
the
following
extracts
are
taken
was
printed
at
northampton
where
the
original
may
still
be
seen
august
in
the
year
it
appears
that
the
author
who
was
officiating
there
as
temporary
chaplain
to
the
jail
was
a
man
of
indisputable
and
integrity
and
a
very
popular
preacher
throughout
the
county
in
order
to
render
his
work
useful
and
instructive
innumerable
references
are
made
to
the
scriptures
but
his
quotations
are
of
too
great
a
length
for
the
following
abridged
tract
which
is
copied
from
the
original
and
contains
only
the
account
of
the
interview
the
author
had
with
croxford
s
ghost
the
ghost
it
appears
from
the
account
given
in
a
pamphlet
reprinted
and
sold
by
henson
letterpress
and
printer
bridge
street
northampton
that
on
saturday
august
john
croxford
together
with
three
others
of
the
names
of
seamark
deacon
and
butlin
were
tried
at
the
assizes
of
northampton
and
convicted
of
murder
it
came
out
at
the
trial
that
the
unfortunate
victim
was
a
native
of
scotland
travelling
with
goods
and
that
by
chance
he
called
at
the
house
of
seamark
a
shepherd
s
hut
in
the
parish
of
guilsborough
northamptonshire
where
croxford
and
his
companions
used
to
meet
where
they
robbed
and
afterwards
cruelly
murdered
him
and
in
order
to
prevent
a
discovery
consumed
his
body
in
an
oven
which
was
proved
on
the
evidence
of
one
of
seamark
s
children
who
was
an
to
the
transaction
by
looking
through
the
crevices
of
the
floor
from
the
room
above
they
were
all
found
guilty
and
executed
on
august
and
croxford
s
body
hung
in
chains
on
hollowell
heath
in
the
parish
of
guilsborough
near
the
spot
where
the
horrid
deed
was
perpetrated
and
no
spot
more
suggestive
of
such
a
tragedy
could
be
imagined
the
author
of
the
work
at
that
time
holding
the
appointment
of
chaplain
to
the
northampton
jail
after
quoting
passages
from
various
writers
to
prove
the
reality
of
the
subject
proceeds
to
give
an
account
of
the
appearance
of
croxford
s
ghost
as
follows
i
shall
now
proceed
without
further
lett
or
impediment
to
a
plain
and
conscientious
account
of
the
ghost
or
apparition
which
was
the
occasion
of
my
troubling
the
world
with
this
narrative
unless
i
first
observe
that
the
behaviour
of
the
prisoners
one
of
whom
is
the
subject
of
these
pages
lately
tried
condemned
and
executed
at
northampton
for
the
murder
of
a
person
unknown
upon
the
evidence
of
ann
seamark
and
her
son
about
nine
or
ten
years
old
was
such
as
astonished
every
beholder
clear
and
conclusive
as
the
evidence
was
against
them
no
arguments
even
after
condemnation
though
delivered
and
enforced
with
the
utmost
energy
precision
and
perspicuity
by
a
learned
and
worthy
divine
were
able
to
reach
their
hardened
hearts
and
prevail
for
an
open
and
unreserved
confession
of
their
guilt
even
at
the
gallows
in
their
last
addresses
to
the
people
they
insisted
on
their
innocence
in
the
strongest
terms
imaginable
wishing
the
heaviest
penalties
an
offended
god
could
inflict
might
be
their
portion
in
the
next
world
if
they
were
guilty
of
the
murder
that
was
laid
to
their
charge
and
for
which
they
were
about
to
suffer
thus
did
they
divide
the
sentiments
of
the
crowd
that
many
were
brought
over
to
a
full
persuasion
of
their
innocence
while
others
were
left
halting
between
two
opinions
and
severely
agitated
with
conflicting
doubts
but
mark
the
event
after
having
instructed
my
people
as
a
teacher
in
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
i
used
to
spend
the
superfluous
hours
of
the
lord
s
day
in
perusing
some
part
or
other
of
the
old
and
new
testament
accordingly
on
august
being
the
sabbath
i
returned
as
usual
into
my
study
the
door
of
which
is
secured
by
a
lock
with
a
and
sat
down
to
my
accustomed
evening
devotion
the
business
of
this
day
by
rotation
laying
in
the
new
testament
and
in
that
part
of
it
where
paul
in
his
epistle
to
the
corinthians
proposes
maintains
and
proves
the
resurrection
of
the
body
struck
with
the
sublimity
of
his
thoughts
boldness
of
his
figures
and
energy
of
his
diction
and
convinced
by
the
number
and
weight
of
his
arguments
and
looking
with
a
pleasing
foretaste
of
happiness
into
futurity
i
was
on
a
sudden
surprised
with
the
perfect
form
and
appearance
of
a
man
who
stood
erect
at
a
small
distance
from
my
right
side
conscious
that
the
door
was
locked
and
that
there
was
no
other
means
by
which
my
visitor
could
have
entered
i
was
considerably
surprised
surprise
turning
into
abject
terror
when
glancing
with
irresistible
fascination
at
the
man
i
perceived
in
him
something
indefinably
but
most
unmistakably
unnatural
feeling
sure
that
i
was
in
the
actual
presence
of
an
apparition
i
contrived
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
i
admit
to
sum
up
sufficient
courage
to
speak
my
voice
seeming
dry
and
unrecognisable
i
addressed
it
in
the
power
and
spirit
of
the
gospel
inquiring
on
what
errand
it
was
sent
what
was
intended
by
such
an
application
and
what
services
could
be
expected
from
a
person
of
so
little
note
and
mean
abilities
as
myself
i
must
here
state
that
although
the
spectre
had
inspired
me
with
so
much
awe
i
did
not
associate
it
with
anything
evil
every
second
tended
to
strengthen
my
composure
and
when
it
spoke
in
a
voice
rather
more
hollow
and
intense
perhaps
than
that
of
a
human
being
my
fears
were
instantly
dissipated
i
was
now
able
to
take
a
close
stock
of
it
and
observed
that
in
features
general
appearance
and
clothes
it
closely
resembled
any
ordinary
labouring
man
it
was
in
expression
and
colouring
only
it
differed
its
eyes
were
lurid
its
cheeks
livid
raising
one
extremely
white
and
emaciated
hand
it
desired
me
to
compose
myself
saying
that
as
it
was
now
strictly
limited
by
a
superior
power
and
could
do
no
one
act
but
by
the
permission
of
god
i
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
abrupt
as
was
its
appearance
and
that
if
i
would
endeavour
to
overcome
the
visible
perturbation
i
was
in
it
would
proceed
in
the
business
of
its
errand
at
this
announcement
my
heart
fluttered
with
an
excitement
i
found
difficult
to
control
was
the
wonderful
mystery
that
had
hitherto
enshrouded
the
existence
and
composition
of
the
unknown
about
to
be
revealed
to
me
was
i
going
to
be
initiated
into
those
secrets
heretofore
denied
to
man
eagerly
promising
to
compose
myself
and
lost
to
all
else
save
the
fascinating
presence
of
my
guest
i
settled
down
to
listen
to
anything
the
phantasm
might
have
to
say
the
room
i
must
here
state
was
lighted
by
a
single
though
rather
powerful
oil
lamp
which
i
had
always
deemed
sufficient
to
illuminate
the
whole
apartment
but
which
now
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
phenomenon
did
not
extend
its
rays
beyond
the
cadaverous
face
of
my
intruder
upon
which
the
full
force
of
its
light
seemed
concentrated
commencing
in
clear
and
solemn
tones
the
phantasm
stated
that
it
was
one
of
the
unhappy
prisoners
executed
at
northampton
on
the
of
august
a
cold
chill
ran
down
my
back
at
this
announcement
which
was
intensified
when
i
recognised
for
the
first
time
that
the
figure
confronting
me
bore
a
startling
likeness
to
one
of
the
prisoners
it
had
been
my
unhappy
lot
to
address
prior
to
his
execution
there
was
the
same
hair
brows
and
beard
black
and
stubby
the
protruding
forehead
and
retreating
chin
that
had
so
repelled
me
the
malshaped
head
and
the
broken
teeth
it
was
indeed
the
ghost
of
one
of
those
diabolical
miscreants
that
stood
before
me
and
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
brought
up
in
the
strict
protestant
faith
i
inadvertently
crossed
myself
the
spectre
went
on
without
apparently
heeding
my
action
it
had
been
so
it
proclaimed
the
principal
and
ringleader
of
the
gang
most
of
whom
it
had
corrupted
debauched
and
seduced
to
that
deplorable
method
of
life
and
it
was
particularly
appointed
by
providence
to
undeceive
the
world
and
remove
those
doubts
which
the
solemn
protestations
of
their
innocence
to
the
very
hour
of
death
had
raised
in
the
minds
of
all
who
heard
at
this
juncture
excitement
overcoming
fear
and
aversion
i
hazarded
to
inquire
of
the
phantasm
its
name
its
reply
delivered
in
the
same
slow
measured
almost
mechanical
tones
as
if
it
were
only
the
of
some
other
and
unseen
agency
was
to
the
effect
that
its
name
was
john
croxford
that
it
had
express
directions
to
come
to
me
directions
it
could
not
disobey
it
furthermore
explained
the
reason
the
murderers
had
so
persistently
insisted
on
their
innocence
lay
in
the
fact
that
while
the
blood
of
their
victim
was
still
warm
they
entered
into
a
sacramental
obligation
which
they
sealed
by
dipping
their
fingers
in
the
blood
of
the
deceased
and
licking
the
same
by
which
they
bound
themselves
under
the
penalty
of
eternal
damnation
never
to
betray
the
fact
themselves
nor
to
confess
if
condemned
to
die
for
it
on
the
evidence
of
others
and
that
they
were
further
encouraged
to
such
measures
since
as
seamark
himself
was
a
confederate
in
the
murder
they
concluded
the
evidence
of
his
wife
would
not
be
admitted
that
as
the
child
was
so
young
they
presumed
no
judge
or
jury
would
pay
the
least
regard
to
his
depositions
that
as
butlin
had
but
lately
entered
into
a
confederacy
with
them
and
no
robberies
could
be
readily
proved
against
him
they
thought
it
would
appear
impossible
for
one
of
his
age
to
begin
a
career
of
wickedness
with
murder
it
being
observed
in
a
proverb
that
no
man
is
abandoned
all
at
once
that
if
they
could
invalidate
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
butlin
it
must
be
of
equal
advantage
to
them
all
that
though
disappointed
of
this
view
in
court
and
condemned
to
die
upon
the
above
evidence
they
were
still
infatuated
with
the
same
notion
even
at
the
gallows
and
expected
a
reprieve
for
butlin
when
the
halter
was
about
his
neck
and
consequently
if
such
a
reprieve
had
been
granted
as
the
evidence
was
as
full
and
decisive
against
butlin
as
against
them
the
sentence
for
the
murder
must
have
been
withdrawn
from
all
their
execution
deferred
and
perhaps
transportation
only
their
final
though
listening
to
every
word
with
abnormal
attention
i
became
at
the
same
time
aware
of
a
strange
and
uncanny
feeling
that
the
identity
of
the
phantasm
was
but
partly
revealed
to
me
in
the
figure
opposite
what
its
true
and
entire
nature
might
be
i
dared
not
even
hazard
a
conjecture
in
the
pause
that
followed
its
last
speech
more
to
hear
myself
speak
than
anything
else
i
could
not
endure
the
silence
of
this
thing
i
asked
if
the
evidence
of
the
woman
and
child
was
clear
punctual
and
particular
to
which
it
replied
it
was
as
circumstantial
distinct
and
methodical
as
possible
varying
not
in
the
least
from
truth
in
any
one
particular
of
consequence
unless
in
the
omission
of
their
horrid
sacrament
which
she
might
possibly
neither
observe
nor
i
then
asked
why
they
had
behaved
with
such
impropriety
impudence
and
clamour
upon
their
trial
to
which
it
replied
that
they
had
been
somewhat
elevated
with
liquor
privately
conveyed
to
them
and
that
by
effrontery
and
a
seemingly
undaunted
behaviour
they
hoped
to
intimidate
the
woman
throw
her
into
confusion
perplex
her
depositions
thereby
rendering
the
evidence
precarious
and
inconclusive
or
at
least
give
the
court
some
favourable
presumptions
of
their
i
next
inquired
whether
they
knew
the
name
of
the
person
murdered
whence
he
came
and
what
reasons
they
had
for
committing
so
horrid
a
barbarity
to
which
the
phantasm
answered
that
the
man
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
them
all
that
the
murder
was
committed
more
out
of
wantonness
and
the
force
of
habits
of
wickedness
than
necessity
as
they
were
at
that
time
in
no
want
of
money
that
they
first
found
occasion
to
quarrel
with
the
pedlar
through
a
strange
propensity
to
mischief
for
which
it
could
not
account
but
from
god
s
withdrawing
his
grace
and
leaving
them
to
all
the
extravagance
and
irregularities
of
a
corrupted
heart
long
hardened
in
the
ways
of
sin
that
the
man
being
stout
and
undaunted
resented
their
and
in
his
own
defence
proceeded
to
blows
that
two
only
deacon
and
croxford
were
at
first
concerned
but
finding
him
resolute
they
had
called
up
seamark
and
butlin
who
were
at
a
distance
behind
the
hedge
that
they
then
all
seized
the
pedlar
notwithstanding
which
he
struggled
with
great
violence
to
the
very
last
against
their
united
efforts
nor
did
they
think
it
safe
to
trifle
any
longer
with
a
man
who
gave
such
proofs
of
uncommon
strength
that
with
much
difficulty
they
dragged
him
down
to
seamark
s
yard
and
there
committed
the
murder
as
represented
in
i
next
asked
if
there
was
any
licence
in
his
bags
or
pockets
that
they
might
discover
his
name
or
place
of
abode
it
replied
no
that
the
paper
left
behind
in
its
croxford
s
writing
was
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
their
conduct
in
this
affair
a
hardened
untruth
abounding
with
reflections
as
false
as
scandalous
and
wicked
suggested
by
the
father
of
lies
who
had
gradually
brought
them
from
one
step
of
iniquity
to
another
beginning
first
in
the
violation
of
morality
to
the
place
of
purgatory
in
which
they
now
it
further
declared
a
statement
that
interested
me
greatly
that
though
their
bodies
were
unaffected
with
pain
their
souls
were
in
darkness
under
all
the
dreadful
apprehensions
of
remaining
there
for
eternity
far
beyond
what
the
liveliest
imagination
while
influenced
by
the
weight
and
grossness
of
matter
can
conceive
that
their
doom
had
been
not
a
little
aggravated
by
their
final
impenitence
impiety
and
profaneness
in
adjuring
god
by
the
most
horrid
imprecations
to
attest
the
truth
of
a
palpable
and
notorious
falsehood
and
by
wishing
that
their
own
portion
in
eternity
might
be
determined
in
consequence
thereof
language
the
apparition
said
was
too
weak
to
describe
and
mortality
incapable
of
conceiving
a
part
of
their
anguish
and
despair
even
at
present
and
happy
would
it
be
for
succeeding
ages
if
posterity
could
be
induced
to
profit
by
their
misfortunes
and
be
influenced
by
this
account
to
avoid
the
punishment
of
the
all
this
the
phantasm
delivered
with
such
increased
distinction
and
perspicuity
with
such
an
emphasis
and
tone
of
voice
as
plainly
evinced
the
truth
of
what
it
spoke
and
claimed
my
closest
attention
and
regard
and
as
it
seemed
to
hint
that
i
was
singled
out
to
acquaint
the
world
with
these
particulars
i
told
it
that
the
present
age
was
one
of
incredulity
and
agnosticism
that
few
gave
credit
to
fables
of
this
kind
that
the
world
would
conclude
me
either
a
madman
or
impostor
or
brand
me
with
the
odious
imputations
of
superstition
and
enthusiasm
that
therefore
true
credentials
would
be
necessary
not
only
to
preserve
my
own
character
but
also
to
procure
respect
and
credit
to
my
relations
to
this
the
phantasm
instantly
responded
that
what
i
observed
was
perfectly
right
and
requisite
to
authenticate
the
truth
of
this
affair
and
that
unless
some
proper
attestations
were
given
to
accounts
of
this
nature
they
would
be
considered
by
the
rational
part
of
mankind
as
mere
tales
invented
only
to
amuse
the
credulous
or
frighten
children
on
a
winter
s
evening
into
temper
and
obedience
in
short
that
they
would
have
no
weight
and
disappoint
the
ends
of
providence
who
intends
them
for
the
good
and
benefit
of
the
world
that
therefore
in
order
to
encourage
my
perseverance
in
supporting
the
truth
of
this
appearance
and
embolden
me
to
publish
a
minute
detail
of
it
it
would
direct
me
to
such
a
criterion
as
would
put
the
reality
of
it
beyond
all
dispute
and
it
accordingly
told
me
that
in
such
a
spot
describing
it
as
minutely
as
possible
in
the
parish
of
guilsborough
was
deposited
a
gold
ring
which
belonged
to
the
pedlar
whom
they
murdered
and
moreover
in
the
inside
was
engraved
this
singular
motto
hanged
he
ll
be
who
steals
me
that
on
perusing
it
the
apparition
continued
it
croxford
had
been
smitten
with
grave
apprehensions
and
thinking
the
words
ominous
had
buried
the
ring
hoping
thus
to
elude
the
sentence
denounced
at
random
against
the
unlawful
possessor
of
it
and
even
escape
the
vindictive
justice
of
heaven
itself
by
such
a
precaution
that
if
i
found
not
every
particular
in
regard
to
this
ring
exactly
as
it
related
it
to
me
then
i
might
conclude
there
was
not
a
single
syllable
of
truth
in
the
whole
and
consequently
no
obligation
lay
upon
me
to
take
any
further
concerns
in
the
engaged
in
this
interesting
and
conversation
i
suddenly
became
aware
it
was
very
late
the
silence
throughout
the
house
for
the
first
time
appalled
me
and
i
was
about
to
make
a
movement
towards
the
door
to
make
sure
all
was
safe
without
when
the
light
from
the
lamp
once
again
became
normal
with
a
startled
glance
i
looked
for
the
phantasm
it
was
gone
nor
was
there
any
other
means
by
which
it
could
have
taken
its
departure
save
by
dematerialisation
bitterly
disappointed
my
fears
being
now
entirely
removed
at
so
abrupt
a
disappearance
i
sat
down
very
calmly
and
in
the
coolest
manner
canvassed
over
the
whole
matter
to
myself
reflected
seriously
on
every
particular
and
was
induced
to
conclude
from
the
coherence
and
punctuality
of
the
account
that
it
was
impossible
it
should
be
fiction
or
imposture
i
laid
particular
stress
upon
the
circumstance
of
the
ring
the
singularity
of
its
motto
and
the
minute
description
of
the
spot
where
it
was
deposited
i
considered
moreover
from
the
tests
i
had
made
by
shutting
my
eyes
and
pressing
the
balls
with
my
forefinger
that
i
had
been
perfectly
awake
had
had
the
full
use
both
of
my
senses
and
reason
and
was
as
capable
of
knowing
the
figure
and
voice
of
a
man
as
the
size
and
print
of
the
book
i
was
reading
at
the
time
the
ghost
made
its
appearance
in
short
firmly
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
what
i
had
heard
and
seen
i
resolved
on
the
morrow
to
search
for
the
ring
and
thereby
clear
it
up
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
accordingly
on
monday
morning
early
between
four
and
five
o
clock
i
set
out
alone
making
directly
to
the
spot
the
phantasm
had
described
found
the
ring
without
the
least
difficulty
or
delay
examined
the
motto
and
date
of
it
which
corresponded
exactly
with
his
account
of
it
and
fully
convinced
me
of
my
obligation
to
communicate
to
the
world
the
particulars
of
the
whole
with
this
resolution
immediately
on
my
return
i
sat
down
and
drew
up
the
whole
conversation
as
near
as
i
could
recollect
neither
omitting
nor
adding
any
circumstance
of
consequence
in
the
manner
you
now
see
it
and
trusting
it
will
prove
of
use
to
the
public
for
whose
benefit
it
seems
intended
the
original
manuscript
to
which
the
author
appends
his
name
concludes
with
a
very
fervid
exhortation
to
piety
coupled
with
an
equally
strong
warning
against
indulgence
in
vice
and
crime
the
story
of
the
ghost
judging
by
the
interest
that
is
even
now
taken
in
it
must
have
created
a
considerable
sensation
at
the
time
so
much
so
that
i
think
a
brief
history
of
the
crime
gruesome
though
it
be
will
bear
repeating
prior
to
doing
so
however
i
should
like
to
relate
a
ghostly
experience
that
happened
to
me
elliott
o
donnell
in
the
same
neighbourhood
august
the
village
of
guilsborough
is
on
an
eminence
miles
by
of
northampton
miles
from
the
source
of
the
avon
at
naseby
miles
from
daventry
miles
from
lutterworth
miles
from
market
harboro
miles
from
rugby
and
miles
from
london
the
adjacent
country
consisting
of
large
stretches
of
smiling
meadows
dales
and
is
very
fair
for
the
eye
to
dwell
upon
and
it
is
only
at
night
when
the
shadows
from
the
many
spinneys
are
cast
upon
the
gleaming
roads
and
silent
tarns
or
when
the
wind
rustling
through
the
elms
and
oaks
sound
like
the
breaking
and
falling
of
surf
on
the
seashore
it
is
only
then
that
the
place
presents
an
entirely
different
aspect
to
the
psychic
mind
and
one
conjures
up
ghosts
during
the
period
of
my
early
visits
to
guilsborough
the
history
of
the
village
was
unknown
to
me
nor
did
i
for
one
moment
associate
it
with
superphysical
manifestations
till
i
was
staying
at
the
hamlet
of
creaton
some
three
miles
distant
and
had
to
tramp
home
late
at
night
i
must
confess
then
that
i
was
unquestionably
glad
to
leave
the
crossroads
at
the
top
of
crow
hill
and
the
lonely
turnpike
behind
and
find
myself
snugly
ensconced
within
the
very
material
precincts
of
the
cricketers
arms
the
route
i
took
led
me
past
the
of
some
nonconformist
fraternity
a
spot
one
never
seemed
to
notice
by
day
but
which
struck
me
as
singularly
eerie
at
night
on
this
particular
night
in
question
i
did
not
leave
my
friend
s
house
in
guilsborough
till
close
on
twelve
an
hour
when
all
village
folk
are
in
bed
and
the
place
is
wrapped
in
the
most
profound
silence
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
as
i
briskly
pounded
down
the
road
echoed
and
through
the
village
i
welcomed
the
sound
it
was
nice
to
have
even
that
for
a
companion
i
am
not
as
a
rule
nervous
i
have
been
too
much
by
myself
in
life
to
be
an
abject
coward
yet
i
must
confess
i
never
anticipated
the
walk
from
guilsborough
along
the
lonely
after
nightfall
without
an
uncomfortable
itching
in
my
back
i
was
just
beginning
to
get
that
sensation
when
i
arrived
at
the
rusty
gates
of
the
cemetery
and
was
confounded
beyond
measure
on
seeing
a
curious
grotesque
sort
of
creature
climb
over
the
iron
bars
and
confront
me
the
moonlight
was
so
powerful
that
it
left
nothing
uncovered
or
concealed
a
frightful
terror
laid
hold
of
me
what
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
could
it
be
gazing
at
it
with
a
fascination
as
hideous
as
the
thing
itself
i
took
in
every
feature
the
long
loose
limbs
the
thin
body
the
huge
hands
and
feet
the
little
repulsive
head
the
white
fulsome
face
and
the
protruding
sapphire
eyes
for
some
seconds
to
me
an
eternity
we
watched
one
another
in
breathless
silence
the
elemental
for
as
such
i
at
length
recognised
it
being
the
first
to
take
the
initiative
the
unfathomable
stare
in
its
eyes
gradually
deepened
into
a
horrible
and
very
unmistakable
expression
of
malignant
joy
in
which
all
the
most
undesirable
of
human
vices
seemed
blended
its
monstrous
hands
rose
like
wings
on
either
side
of
its
head
the
fingers
twitching
convulsively
in
greedy
anticipation
of
clutching
me
its
legs
slowly
crouched
as
if
about
to
spring
and
then
just
as
the
crucial
moment
arrived
and
the
acme
of
my
terrors
was
reached
the
spell
was
broken
the
leaden
weights
fell
from
off
my
feet
my
limbs
became
endowed
with
a
thousandfold
their
natural
elasticity
and
turning
round
i
fled
so
ended
my
first
and
only
experience
with
a
guilsborough
ghost
i
have
taken
very
good
care
since
then
to
give
that
a
very
wide
berth
after
nightfall
but
now
comes
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
it
i
had
heard
that
a
certain
house
in
the
village
since
pulled
down
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
that
one
bedroom
in
particular
had
struck
those
occupying
it
as
containing
an
invisible
presence
both
inimical
and
horrible
i
never
however
associated
this
mysterious
something
with
the
elemental
i
had
seen
till
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
with
an
old
and
highly
respected
inhabitant
of
the
village
a
few
days
since
august
i
learned
that
he
had
had
a
psychical
adventure
of
a
somewhat
extraordinary
nature
in
his
boyhood
upon
pressing
him
he
told
me
that
he
had
lived
in
the
haunted
house
as
a
child
and
on
running
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
one
morning
had
seen
a
long
thin
human
form
with
a
tiny
head
and
animal
s
face
crouching
on
the
bed
and
staring
at
him
terrified
out
of
his
wits
by
this
unexpected
and
startling
spectacle
he
had
remained
glued
to
the
spot
for
some
seconds
until
a
slight
movement
on
the
part
of
the
elemental
broke
the
spell
and
he
was
able
to
bolt
precipitately
from
the
apartment
this
was
the
only
time
he
saw
it
here
then
surely
was
the
key
to
the
nature
of
the
haunting
an
elemental
or
poltergeist
assuredly
the
same
that
had
appeared
to
me
some
fifty
years
later
at
the
gate
of
the
old
my
informant
by
the
way
had
not
heard
of
my
experience
i
had
told
it
to
no
one
hence
this
visual
occult
manifestation
of
mine
in
guilsborough
stands
corroborated
but
why
this
haunting
why
this
form
of
apparition
i
dived
into
the
history
of
guilsborough
and
discovered
that
quantities
of
fossils
trilobites
together
with
implements
of
flint
javelins
celts
the
latter
popularly
known
as
thunderbolts
have
been
and
are
still
found
in
various
parts
of
the
village
and
in
the
of
the
adjoining
hamlets
of
nortorft
and
hollowell
that
tumuli
yet
remain
in
guilsborough
park
and
in
several
of
the
neighbouring
fields
and
that
numbers
of
very
ancient
bones
have
been
from
time
to
time
dug
out
of
the
soil
in
all
parts
of
the
village
all
this
is
conclusive
evidence
that
guilsborough
is
far
older
than
its
average
inhabitant
of
imagines
that
it
has
been
alternately
the
site
of
palaeolithic
and
neolithic
settlements
and
that
all
sorts
of
barbaric
rites
and
ceremonies
have
been
conducted
on
the
very
ground
where
houses
and
cottages
now
stand
hence
it
is
not
very
surprising
to
any
one
at
all
versed
in
the
of
phantasms
and
psychic
phenomena
to
hear
that
one
of
the
apparitions
at
least
haunting
guilsborough
appears
in
the
form
of
a
or
elemental
superphysical
manifestations
of
this
kind
let
me
explain
for
the
benefit
of
the
inexperienced
usually
occur
on
the
sites
of
or
near
ancient
and
unconsecrated
or
the
whys
and
the
wherefores
of
which
i
hope
to
dwell
upon
in
detail
in
a
subsequent
volume
part
ii
i
now
append
the
account
of
the
croxford
trial
copied
with
as
few
alterations
as
possible
from
the
pamphlet
reprinted
by
henson
of
northampton
in
at
the
assizes
held
at
northampton
on
thursday
august
came
on
before
the
right
honourable
the
lord
chief
baron
varker
the
trials
of
benjamin
deacon
john
croxford
and
richard
butlin
for
the
murder
of
a
travelling
pedlar
known
only
as
scottie
at
a
house
of
called
catslo
in
the
parish
of
guilsborough
kept
by
one
thomas
seamark
who
was
executed
at
northampton
on
april
last
for
a
robbery
on
the
highway
and
had
been
a
receptacle
of
thieves
and
highwaymen
for
some
time
the
chief
evidence
against
them
was
that
of
anne
seamark
widow
of
the
above
thomas
seamark
she
deposed
that
sometime
between
michaelmas
and
christmas
last
the
said
pedlar
supposed
to
be
one
thomas
corey
came
to
the
said
house
where
were
at
that
time
the
said
seamark
deacon
croxford
and
butlin
to
whom
he
offered
stockings
for
sale
but
not
agreeing
as
to
the
price
they
proposed
to
murder
him
and
directly
seamark
knocked
him
down
butlin
fell
upon
his
legs
deacon
upon
his
face
to
prevent
him
crying
out
and
croxford
pulling
out
a
knife
cut
his
throat
in
such
a
manner
that
the
head
was
almost
off
but
the
body
stirring
a
little
croxford
stabbed
him
in
the
head
which
put
an
end
to
his
life
they
then
stripped
him
and
carried
the
clothes
upstairs
where
seamark
s
three
children
were
in
bed
after
which
a
hole
was
dug
by
seamark
in
the
close
adjoining
to
the
house
where
they
buried
the
body
but
thinking
themselves
not
safe
they
dug
up
the
body
again
and
cut
it
into
several
pieces
these
latter
they
put
into
an
oven
and
were
three
days
and
nights
trying
to
consume
them
in
the
end
succeeding
only
with
the
flesh
and
having
to
bury
the
bones
which
were
now
produced
in
court
and
held
as
testimony
against
them
being
asked
by
the
judge
why
she
did
not
reveal
the
same
before
seamark
answered
that
her
husband
threatened
to
murder
her
if
she
mentioned
it
to
anyone
whilst
croxford
holding
a
knife
to
her
throat
with
one
hand
and
having
a
book
in
the
other
swore
he
would
instantly
kill
her
if
she
did
not
take
an
oath
to
conceal
all
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
next
witness
for
the
prosecution
seamark
s
little
boy
of
ten
years
of
age
stated
that
on
being
kicked
one
day
at
school
by
a
playmate
he
had
in
a
passion
cried
out
that
he
would
serve
him
as
his
daddy
served
scottie
which
statement
being
overheard
by
the
schoolmaster
the
latter
called
him
into
his
presence
and
demanded
an
explanation
on
the
witness
refusing
to
comply
he
was
shut
in
a
room
by
himself
where
he
remained
till
the
arrival
of
his
mother
in
the
meantime
the
schoolmaster
who
like
everyone
else
in
guilsborough
had
only
known
the
pedlar
by
the
name
of
scottie
and
like
other
folk
had
wondered
at
his
long
absence
from
the
village
seeing
that
many
people
owed
him
money
and
others
were
in
want
of
goods
began
to
put
two
and
two
together
and
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
boy
knew
more
than
he
dare
tell
when
seamark
entered
the
house
in
a
state
of
breathless
alarm
to
know
why
her
son
had
not
turned
up
for
his
dinner
whereupon
the
schoolmaster
had
boldly
taxed
her
with
a
knowledge
of
scottie
s
fate
which
after
no
little
hesitation
and
a
great
many
tears
she
had
admitted
this
had
led
to
the
present
witness
confessing
that
chancing
to
peep
through
the
cracks
of
the
chamber
floor
one
afternoon
he
had
seen
his
father
and
some
other
men
trying
to
burn
some
hands
and
feet
in
an
oven
near
to
which
were
a
light
grey
coat
and
a
cane
which
he
recognised
as
belonging
to
scottie
who
had
been
to
their
house
the
day
before
on
being
asked
by
the
judge
if
he
could
identify
the
prisoners
with
the
men
he
had
seen
helping
his
father
he
at
once
answered
in
the
affirmative
this
concluded
his
testimony
after
which
several
other
witnesses
whose
evidence
i
can
not
record
here
through
lack
of
space
were
then
called
croxford
deacon
and
butlin
protesting
their
innocence
of
the
crime
laid
against
them
declaring
that
the
whole
case
had
been
maliciously
trumped
up
by
seamark
and
her
son
after
the
evidence
on
both
sides
had
been
thoroughly
examined
the
judge
summed
up
and
the
jury
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
absence
returned
with
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
a
demonstration
being
made
by
the
prisoners
against
ann
seamark
as
she
left
the
court
on
saturday
august
the
prisoners
were
carried
from
the
jail
to
the
place
of
execution
guarded
by
a
party
of
sir
charles
howard
s
dragoons
with
fixed
bayonets
and
muskets
loaded
with
powder
and
ball
where
they
joined
fervently
in
the
prayers
with
the
minister
croxford
delivering
a
paper
to
one
of
the
attendant
gaolers
which
he
desired
might
be
published
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
world
this
document
is
too
long
to
quote
a
brief
summary
will
suffice
in
it
john
croxford
says
that
he
is
about
years
of
age
and
by
trade
a
tailor
that
he
was
born
at
brixworth
of
creditable
parents
who
gave
him
a
liberal
education
and
that
his
character
and
behaviour
were
very
good
until
about
january
when
he
got
into
bad
company
which
had
proved
his
ruin
this
much
he
confessed
but
denied
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
murder
benjamin
deacon
writes
that
he
was
born
at
spratton
is
about
years
of
age
and
by
trade
a
sawyer
that
he
bore
a
tolerably
good
character
until
about
christmas
last
when
he
committed
various
crimes
but
not
murder
richard
butlin
testifies
that
he
was
born
of
respectable
parents
at
guilsborough
had
a
good
education
is
about
twenty
years
of
age
and
by
trade
a
glover
and
breeches
maker
that
he
has
always
borne
a
good
character
and
is
innocent
of
murder
the
manuscript
goes
on
to
say
that
they
the
said
john
croxford
benj
deacon
and
richard
butlin
were
to
die
the
next
day
being
condemned
on
the
false
oath
of
ann
seamark
the
vilest
wretch
that
ever
appeared
in
a
court
of
justice
and
that
there
was
not
one
word
of
truth
in
her
evidence
and
that
of
her
boy
it
being
a
hellish
and
malicious
contrivance
of
their
s
to
take
away
their
lives
that
croxford
was
never
with
butlin
until
guilsborough
feast
which
was
about
the
of
october
and
never
was
in
the
close
with
butlin
and
deacon
but
once
and
that
about
the
of
november
and
never
in
the
house
with
them
and
that
in
their
opinion
no
murder
had
been
committed
that
they
did
not
doubt
but
the
whole
affair
would
be
brought
to
light
though
too
late
to
be
of
any
service
to
them
and
that
they
hoped
ann
seamark
would
be
rewarded
according
to
her
deserts
that
they
would
die
in
peace
with
her
and
with
all
the
world
bearing
her
no
malice
only
hoping
the
great
god
would
make
known
their
innocence
the
document
winds
up
with
these
words
done
in
northampton
gaol
the
night
before
the
execution
as
a
caution
to
all
good
people
we
the
poor
unhappy
sufferers
do
severally
set
our
hands
to
this
it
being
nothing
but
truth
john
croxford
benj
deacon
richard
at
the
place
of
execution
they
behaved
with
great
fortitude
still
denying
their
knowledge
of
the
murder
but
confessing
themselves
guilty
of
many
irregularities
they
gave
much
attention
to
the
divine
service
and
departed
advising
all
the
spectators
to
beware
of
keeping
bad
company
and
declaring
that
they
died
in
peace
with
the
world
after
their
execution
the
body
of
croxford
was

my
name
is
elizabeth
rita
browne
i
am
a
native
of
birmingham
and
my
husband
john
alexander
is
the
rector
of
a
small
parish
near
wolverhampton
in
the
summer
of
my
husband
who
had
long
been
ailing
never
having
properly
recovered
from
an
attack
of
typhoid
was
obliged
to
take
a
holiday
engaging
a
locum
to
do
his
work
like
the
majority
of
clergymen
his
stipend
was
not
very
large
and
we
could
not
consequently
afford
to
go
to
any
expensive
place
an
advertisement
in
a
fashion
gazette
attracting
our
attention
we
at
once
made
inquiries
with
the
result
that
wolsey
abbey
became
ours
for
three
months
at
a
practically
nominal
rent
of
course
it
was
in
an
extremely
spot
there
was
no
railway
within
six
miles
and
the
neighbourhood
was
dull
flat
and
uninteresting
still
we
might
have
marvelled
at
getting
it
so
absurdly
cheap
had
we
not
heard
that
money
was
of
no
object
to
the
owner
who
was
a
we
arrived
early
one
evening
in
july
the
sun
was
yet
visible
in
the
sky
and
its
dying
efforts
would
have
enhanced
the
meanest
rural
beauty
i
can
not
say
we
were
comfortably
impressed
with
the
building
it
was
of
course
simply
colossal
compared
with
our
own
little
home
but
so
grim
and
grey
so
forlorn
and
forbidding
and
withal
so
inhospitable
that
a
momentary
fear
seized
me
lest
its
leaden
hued
and
crumbling
walls
should
prove
our
the
grounds
overgrown
with
every
imaginable
kind
of
weed
that
here
attained
brobdingnagian
dimensions
gently
shelved
down
to
the
house
which
lay
in
a
minute
valley
dank
damp
and
dismal
the
funereal
aspect
being
further
augmented
by
clumps
of
giant
pines
and
elms
the
shadows
from
which
were
already
beginning
to
wave
phantastically
on
both
walls
and
gables
to
our
right
almost
hidden
by
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
and
luxuriant
herbage
we
espied
the
twinkling
surface
of
a
sheet
of
water
which
we
subsequently
learned
was
a
tarn
or
lake
of
almost
unfathomable
depth
and
darkness
the
principal
feature
of
the
mansion
seemed
to
be
that
of
antiquity
of
excessive
antiquity
more
particularly
the
gothic
monastic
dome
which
resting
on
norman
columns
formed
the
termination
of
the
left
wing
the
right
and
central
portion
of
the
house
dating
back
i
believe
to
henry
viith
s
reign
though
of
this
i
have
no
positive
proof
the
lapse
of
ages
had
wrought
much
discolouration
added
to
which
was
the
disfigurement
caused
by
lichens
and
minute
fungi
that
spreading
over
the
whole
exterior
hung
in
a
fine
tangled
from
the
eaves
but
apart
from
this
there
were
no
very
great
dilapidations
the
masonry
remaining
intact
whilst
the
woodwork
save
for
a
few
deep
rents
and
indentures
seemed
to
be
in
an
extraordinarily
good
state
of
repair
the
hand
of
nature
had
apparently
been
peremptorily
and
mysteriously
arrested
in
its
work
of
dissolution
and
decay
the
inside
of
the
house
though
not
belying
the
mournful
expectations
we
had
formed
from
the
exterior
drew
from
us
all
exclamations
of
wonder
and
admiration
never
had
we
seen
such
magnificent
oak
panelling
nor
such
exquisitely
carved
ceilings
nor
such
vast
stretches
of
tapestry
worn
and
faded
though
it
was
whilst
the
ebon
blackness
of
the
floors
and
the
size
and
massiveness
of
the
furniture
were
what
we
had
hitherto
only
associated
with
the
grandeur
of
a
palace
or
castle
my
daughters
mary
and
eunice
were
charmed
and
impressed
and
both
my
husband
and
i
felt
our
misgivings
rapidly
diminish
when
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
enjoying
a
dainty
and
supper
in
one
of
the
large
and
stately
reception
rooms
the
first
days
of
our
sojourn
there
passed
with
the
pleasant
monotony
of
rest
we
rambled
through
the
long
and
straggling
and
seemingly
interminable
corridors
of
the
house
and
about
the
grounds
and
gardens
finding
much
to
marvel
at
much
to
envy
in
the
day
time
the
sun
struggling
feebly
through
the
trellised
panes
of
glass
filled
the
rooms
and
passages
with
a
crimson
glow
a
glow
both
warming
and
enriching
but
at
various
times
and
in
certain
places
startlingly
and
horribly
suggestive
of
blood
the
analogy
struck
me
the
more
forcibly
each
day
i
observed
it
so
much
so
that
i
grew
afraid
to
ascend
the
staircases
alone
mary
and
eunice
laughed
at
my
misgivings
to
them
the
house
and
surroundings
were
the
quintessence
of
mediæval
splendour
and
romance
they
revelled
in
the
grandeur
of
the
interior
trappings
in
the
freedom
of
the
vast
park
and
gardens
it
was
only
after
the
third
week
that
they
too
suddenly
grew
afraid
but
whereas
my
fears
had
been
prompted
by
a
comparison
a
comparison
which
however
near
and
repellent
still
remained
a
comparison
theirs
were
generated
by
something
which
although
scarcely
more
tangible
was
unmistakably
real
they
were
constantly
assailed
by
a
smell
a
cold
icy
cold
pungent
beastly
smell
that
would
on
some
occasions
approach
them
along
a
corridor
or
staircase
and
at
others
steal
surreptitiously
behind
them
from
some
obscure
nook
or
cranny
it
was
foul
pestilential
inexplicable
they
had
never
smelt
anything
like
it
before
it
was
nothing
recognisable
it
neither
emanated
from
drainage
nor
from
dead
animals
behind
the
it
was
nauseous
suffocating
freezing
and
as
if
it
lived
it
moved
from
the
moment
they
first
became
aware
of
its
presence
their
pleasure
in
the
house
ceased
all
their
time
was
now
spent
in
the
garden
but
in
that
part
of
the
garden
only
whence
no
view
of
the
tarn
could
be
obtained
and
where
there
were
no
trees
neither
my
husband
nor
i
had
encountered
the
smell
but
it
was
not
very
long
before
the
servants
did
and
one
by
one
they
left
nor
could
we
find
any
that
were
willing
to
take
their
place
the
abbey
bearing
a
very
evil
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
the
question
of
our
daughters
health
began
to
cause
us
some
anxiety
were
we
doing
right
in
remaining
in
the
house
and
exposing
them
to
the
danger
of
some
serious
malady
for
although
the
origin
of
the
smell
was
a
mystery
the
effect
of
so
horrible
a
stench
could
not
prove
otherwise
than
injurious
we
decided
therefore
to
give
up
our
tenancy
at
the
expiration
of
another
week
the
idea
of
quitting
such
palatial
quarters
and
retiring
to
the
meanness
of
some
petty
villa
or
cottage
not
disturbing
us
half
so
much
as
our
inability
to
arrive
at
the
cause
of
that
smell
in
the
silence
of
the
night
when
no
other
sounds
were
to
be
heard
save
the
gentle
beating
of
the
branches
against
our
window
and
the
occasional
hooting
of
an
owl
we
lay
awake
and
wondered
wondered
why
it
never
came
to
us
but
always
to
mary
and
eunice
the
house
i
have
said
was
liberally
furnished
both
rooms
and
passages
were
covered
with
soft
if
somewhat
faded
carpets
there
was
no
lack
of
tables
couches
chairs
whilst
the
walls
were
adorned
with
pictures
which
though
darkened
by
dust
and
blistered
by
the
sun
revealed
the
art
of
old
and
masters
but
it
was
the
library
that
attracted
and
pleased
us
most
there
arranged
methodically
in
the
ample
bookcases
were
volumes
of
every
description
books
of
ancient
lore
richardson
s
pamela
defoe
s
moll
of
flanders
tyndale
s
bible
dryden
s
and
gifford
s
translations
from
the
classics
the
mysticisms
of
swedenborg
behmen
and
plotinus
and
countless
others
many
even
of
greater
rarity
and
value
bound
uniformly
in
those
covers
of
rich
moroccan
leather
so
characteristic
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
one
among
all
others
had
riveted
our
attention
from
the
very
first
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
peculiar
and
ghastly
phenomenon
produced
by
the
sun
s
rays
penetrating
the
coloured
glass
in
the
corridors
and
on
the
staircases
here
it
was
even
more
pronounced
though
only
very
locally
the
full
force
of
the
rays
being
focussed
in
the
most
startling
manner
on
the
metal
clasp
of
a
volume
of
stupendous
size
and
apparently
vast
antiquity
the
result
being
that
whereas
the
entire
book
was
bathed
in
a
bloody
halo
the
others
were
left
in
a
comparatively
clear
and
normal
light
appalled
yet
fascinated
by
this
unaccountable
anomaly
we
had
several
times
attempted
to
remove
the
volume
in
order
to
pry
into
its
contents
but
we
were
unable
to
do
so
owing
we
imagined
to
its
having
stuck
or
being
fastened
in
some
peculiar
manner
to
the
shelf
and
we
were
afraid
to
use
any
great
force
for
fear
of
damaging
the
cover
consequently
our
curiosity
had
to
remain
unsatisfied
the
night
however
preceding
our
departure
from
the
abbey
august
my
husband
had
already
left
by
a
train
i
was
whiling
away
the
few
remaining
hours
in
the
study
mary
and
eunice
being
as
i
thought
engaged
in
packing
when
suddenly
i
heard
some
one
approach
the
door
as
if
on
tiptoe
the
next
moment
there
came
a
loud
knock
and
the
sonorous
sound
of
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
alcove
beside
me
commencing
to
strike
seven
the
two
noises
were
almost
simultaneous
wondering
who
my
visitor
could
be
our
only
servant
a
woman
from
the
nearest
village
having
left
an
hour
ago
i
smoothed
my
gown
and
walking
hastily
to
the
door
threw
it
open
as
i
did
so
a
current
of
cold
air
tainted
with
the
most
disgusting
and
detestable
stench
conceivable
sent
me
half
staggering
half
choking
backwards
and
i
perceived
standing
on
the
threshold
not
ten
paces
from
me
two
figures
of
hellish
horror
featureless
fleshless
foul
clad
in
the
tattered
rotted
garments
of
a
monk
and
nun
they
confronted
me
motionless
silent
and
then
the
voice
of
my
eunice
attracting
their
attention
they
slowly
wheeled
round
and
glided
ghoulishly
along
the
passage
i
gave
one
shriek
of
warning
to
eunice
as
she
hove
in
sight
carrying
in
her
arms
a
tray
of
odds
and
ends
for
me
to
sort
for
a
second
or
so
she
stood
too
petrified
to
move
and
then
as
the
things
appeared
on
the
verge
of
touching
her
with
their
long
outstretched
arms
she
dropped
the
tray
and
uttering
a
kind
of
terrified
gasp
fled
precipitately
they
did
not
pursue
her
but
gliding
onward
with
the
same
mechanical
movements
suddenly
vanished
on
reaching
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
nor
did
we
i
am
thankful
to
say
see
them
again
the
smell
had
explained
itself
anxious
to
get
to
eunice
and
fearsome
lest
she
should
have
fainted
i
was
about
to
quit
the
study
when
my
eyes
were
attracted
to
an
object
on
the
floor
it
was
the
mysterious
volume
which
loosened
from
the
shelf
in
some
miraculous
fashion
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
now
lay
open
its
ponderous
gilded
clasps
undone
and
limp
the
fading
sunlight
concentrating
its
rays
on
the
pages
of
the
book
in
a
final
and
prodigiously
bloody
effort
enabled
me
to
read
the
following
extract
and
for
this
great
and
unpardonable
sin
of
the
abbess
hilda
and
the
monk
nicholas
we
the
saintly
and
beloved

together
with

entomb
them
alive
clasped
in
each
other
s
arms
cursing
man
and
blaspheming
heaven
on
the
eve
of
the
day
of
august
and
of
the
exact
spot
in
the
abbey
of
wolsey
wherein
they
be
buried
no
man
save
we
who
placed
them
there
knoweth
nor
shall
any
discover
the
same
until
the
day
cometh
when
the
secrets
of
all
flesh
shall
be
this
much
i
read
and
no
more
for
the
light
proving
too
strong
for
me
i
was
compelled
to
remove
my
gaze
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
again
the
volume
it
had
gone
and
lo
to
my
intense
and
unfeigned
amazement
it
was
back
again
in
its
customary
place
on
the
shelf
nor
could
the
united
efforts
of
myself
and
daughters
remove
it
from
that
spot
regarding
this
extraordinary
incident
as
the
only
feasible
explanation
of
the
phenomena
eunice
and
i
had
seen
we
could
arrive
at
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
house
once
wolsey
abbey
was
haunted
by
the
phantasms
of
the
abbess
hilda
and
the
monk
nicholas
and
with
such
an
explanation
we
have
had
to
be
content

few
are
more
so
than
missing
one
s
train
especially
when
it
happens
to
be
the
last
in
the
day
this
unpleasant
experience
happened
to
me
one
evening
early
in
september
i
came
into
euston
just
as
the
for
northampton
the
last
train
connected
with
brixworth
was
steaming
out
of
the
station
and
so
i
had
to
remain
in
town
all
night
where
to
put
up
now
became
the
absorbing
question
i
wanted
to
be
close
to
the
station
in
order
to
catch
the
earliest
morning
train
but
although
there
were
plenty
of
rich
men
s
hotels
there
seemed
a
sore
dearth
of
it
was
either
five
shillings
the
night
or
sixpence
purgatory
or
hell
i
could
see
no
place
that
suited
me
at
last
after
traversing
many
squares
and
the
more
respectable
of
the
side
streets
i
retraced
my
steps
eventually
alighting
on
a
private
and
inconsequential
looking
hotel
in
euston
road
the
interior
of
the
establishment
was
in
keeping
with
the
exterior
gloomy
and
forbidding
and
the
damp
earthy
smell
that
seemed
to
rise
from
the
basement
made
me
gravely
apprehensive
of
rheumatism
still
the
tariff
was
in
strict
accordance
with
my
means
and
feeling
too
tired
to
wander
further
i
decided
to
remain
the
room
in
which
i
had
a
very
sparse
supper
was
like
the
majority
of
in
hotels
overcrowded
with
unwieldy
furniture
frowsy
imagine
that
the
table
had
been
laid
once
and
for
all
it
had
undoubtedly
presented
the
same
spectacle
for
months
and
that
the
cloth
never
very
white
was
removed
only
when
it
grew
too
begrimed
even
for
the
blunted
susceptibilities
of
the
proprietress
i
afterwards
found
that
the
beef
did
not
belie
its
looks
that
the
bread
was
in
excellent
accord
and
that
the
water
might
well
have
been
the
receptacle
of
innumerable
generations
of
bacilli
there
were
other
visitors
besides
myself
either
germans
or
commercial
travellers
probably
both
but
as
their
conversation
carried
on
over
plates
of
half
raw
meat
was
neither
particularly
edifying
nor
interesting
i
preferred
an
antique
number
of
until
at
length
tiring
of
that
i
picked
up
a
candlestick
and
made
my
way
to
bed
the
moment
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
my
room
that
peculiar
and
indefinable
sensation
that
invariably
suggests
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
superphysical
came
over
me
i
felt
sure
the
house
was
haunted
but
by
what
ah
that
was
the
problem
left
for
me
to
solve
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
of
the
orthodox
type
inartistic
scant
and
seedy
a
gaunt
propped
against
the
middle
of
the
wall
running
at
right
angles
to
the
door
was
adorned
with
exceedingly
dirty
valances
of
a
nondescript
pink
and
white
pattern
facing
this
was
a
fireplace
the
register
of
which
was
of
course
down
to
the
left
of
this
was
a
hanging
wardrobe
that
i
at
once
examined
and
found
to
contain
nothing
more
formidable
than
a
score
or
two
of
that
scuttled
unceremoniously
away
into
holes
at
the
sight
of
my
candle
whilst
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
facing
the
window
was
a
rickety
surmounted
by
a
still
more
rickety
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
a
from
which
the
white
paint
had
peeled
in
a
hundred
places
and
in
the
other
corner
a
dismantled
bureau
that
resembled
some
vessel
after
a
great
storm
these
i
believe
apart
from
a
couple
of
chairs
constituted
the
entire
furniture
nor
can
i
say
this
scantiness
taking
into
consideration
the
poorness
of
the
quality
was
any
matter
of
regret
the
carpet
undoubtedly
the
best
feature
of
the
room
and
either
an
axminster
or
a
brussels
not
being
an
expert
on
such
a
point
i
can
not
tell
which
hid
all
the
boarding
save
where
the
margins
were
stained
with
a
preparation
of
potash
i
give
all
these
details
to
show
that
several
years
of
practical
investigation
of
haunted
houses
had
developed
my
inquiring
faculties
to
a
very
high
degree
little
if
anything
escaping
my
notice
the
d
of
ghosts
often
lies
where
it
is
least
expected
in
some
article
of
furniture
not
infrequently
a
cupboard
near
at
hand
in
the
panelling
the
skirting
or
not
infrequently
again
on
or
under
the
boards
when
i
am
in
a
haunted
room
my
first
instinct
therefore
is
to
take
a
very
careful
stock
of
my
surroundings
the
bare
appearance
or
touch
of
a
piece
of
furniture
often
supplying
me
with
the
necessary
clue
on
this
occasion
however
nothing
arousing
my
suspicions
and
feeling
abnormally
sleepy
i
bolted
my
door
and
lay
on
the
bed
i
say
on
not
in
as
a
cursory
glance
at
the
pillow
made
me
draw
deductions
as
to
the
sheets
within
a
few
minutes
i
went
to
sleep
falling
into
a
heavy
dreamless
slumber
from
which
i
was
suddenly
and
most
alarmingly
awakened
by
the
feeling
i
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
room
opening
my
eyes
i
perceived
the
apartment
flooded
with
a
bright
unnatural
light
that
apparently
emanated
from
or
at
all
events
accompanied
the
figure
of
a
little
old
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
a
heliotrope
skirt
i
noticed
these
idiosyncrasies
of
person
and
dress
directly
the
nature
of
the
light
accentuating
them
and
my
senses
being
as
they
always
are
in
the
presence
of
superphysical
phenomena
wonderfully
and
painfully
acute
standing
in
front
of
the
the
eccentric
individual
was
examining
herself
with
the
greatest
curiosity
in
the
crazy
to
which
allusion
has
already
been
made
her
profile
was
angular
her
lack
of
colour
ghastly
whilst
from
her
ears
hung
that
style
of
worn
by
ladies
in
the
days
of
the
crinoline
otherwise
her
costume
might
have
belonged
to
the
latter
seventies
or
early
eighties
there
was
nothing
actually
horrible
about
her
save
her
reflection
and
as
my
eyes
turned
with
irresistible
fascination
towards
the
my
blood
turned
to
ice
the
surface
of
the
mirror
made
preternaturally
bright
flashed
back
the
most
hideous
the
most
incomparably
hideous
image
of
fear
never
never
in
all
my
life
had
i
seen
depicted
in
aught
but
wiertz
s
pictures
such
inconceivably
awful
terror
as
that
which
confronted
me
there
and
now
as
i
gazed
at
it
a
sickly
curiosity
seized
me
as
to
what
could
be
the
origin
of
such
hellish
fear
was
it
fear
of
death
of
the
unknown
metetherical
abysses
of
eternal
damnation
of
what
then
as
i
followed
the
direction
of
the
dilating
pupils
i
saw
god
help
me
the
cause
descending
from
a
few
inches
above
her
head
were
the
coils
of
a
rope
had
i
been
able
to
turn
my
head
maybe
i
should
have
seen
whence
they
came
but
i
could
not
move
a
muscle
and
could
only
feel
the
keynote
to
some
great
and
hitherto
unsolvable
mystery
was
at
hand
but
purposely
hidden
from
me
there
was
scant
time
for
speculation
the
enactment
of
this
drama
was
brief
as
it
was
lurid
uttering
an
appalling
scream
that
was
quickly
converted
into
a
gurgle
of
the
most
significance
the
old
lady
clawed
the
air
with
her
spidery
fingers
the
murderer
was
pitiless
the
noose
coming
to
with
an
irresistible
snap
jerked
the
wretched
victim
off
her
feet
for
one
instant
the
most
harrowing
of
all
i
watched
her
falling
backwards
watched
the
changing
of
her
deadly
pallor
into
a
deep
and
vivid
purple
watched
the
rolling
of
her
starting
eyeballs
the
on
her
lips
and
the
frenzied
movements
of
her
stiffening
arms
and
then
then
as
she
struck
the
ground
with
a
reverberating
crash
all
was
darkness
the
ghostly
tragedy
for
this
night
at
least
was
over
this
i
realised
but
my
nerves
being
too
completely
unstrung
by
what
i
had
witnessed
to
allow
me
to
sleep
i
crept
under
the
counterpane
and
lay
there
shivering
till
the
welcome
rays
of
early
dawn
converted
the
room
into
another
place
my
first
movement
was
to
examine
the
scene
of
the
ghostly
murder
and
upon
turning
up
the
carpet
i
discovered
not
a
bloodstain
but
a
comparatively
new
piece
of
boarding
with
that
drawing
my
own
conclusions
i
had
to
rest
content
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
room
that
could
in
any
way
have
been
transmuted
into
evidence
the
moment
the
clock
struck
six
i
picked
up
my
valise
and
gobbling
down
a
lukewarm
breakfast
with
little
relish
quitted
the
house
determining
to
pay
it
another
visit
before
very
long
in
this
however
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
some
months
elapsed
before
i
could
again
visit
the
neighbourhood
of
euston
and
when
i
did
so
i
found
the
hotel
had
vanished
nor
have
i
to
this
day
been
able
to
identify
the
house
wherein
i
slept
i
have
but
lately
been
informed
that
a
good
many
years
ago
when
we
fogies
were
mere
children
a
singularly
repulsive
murder
was
committed
at
a
house
in
or
near
euston
road
the
victim
being
a
somewhat
extraordinary
old
lady
further
details
i
do
not
know
therefore
i
can
only
surmise
that
what
i
saw
may
possibly
have
been
her
phantasm
but
please
remember
it
is
only
a
surmise
panmaur
hollow
merioneth
the
black
pedlar
technical
form
of
apparition
phantasm
of
the
dead
source
of
authenticity
ladies
cabinet
and
elsewhere
cause
of
haunting
murder
the
ladies
cabinet
for
contains
an
account
of
a
haunting
in
merioneth
that
seems
to
me
of
sufficient
psychic
interest
to
record
hence
i
append
it
but
since
the
original
text
is
a
trifle
too
intricate
in
places
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
tell
the
story
more
or
less
in
my
own
words
in
the
summer
of
i
was
on
a
walking
tour
in
wales
in
selecting
as
the
principal
scene
of
my
operations
merioneth
and
chancing
one
evening
to
be
overtaken
by
a
storm
when
midway
between
dolgelly
and
bala
i
was
speedily
placed
in
the
most
unpleasant
of
predicaments
to
go
on
i
was
afraid
to
turn
back
was
impossible
what
could
i
do
the
night
was
dark
the
rain
almost
tropical
and
the
roadway
so
broken
up
with
furrows
that
i
could
only
grope
along
with
the
utmost
difficulty
whilst
the
frequent
windings
steep
ascents
and
sharp
declivities
not
only
added
to
my
embarrassment
but
greatly
increased
my
weariness
at
every
few
yards
i
either
plunged
into
a
miniature
morass
or
stumbling
over
a
boulder
found
myself
smarting
in
the
centre
of
a
gorse
bush
at
length
i
grew
desperate
human
nature
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
resolving
to
perish
with
the
cold
rather
than
flounder
on
under
such
pitiable
conditions
i
threw
myself
down
on
a
rock
and
prepared
to
lie
there
till
daybreak
it
is
possible
i
had
remained
in
this
position
for
ten
or
so
minutes
when
i
was
roused
to
a
sense
of
deliverance
by
the
bright
glow
of
a
lamp
and
starting
up
to
my
feet
i
discovered
i
was
no
longer
alone
confronting
me
was
the
figure
of
a
short
man
wrapped
in
a
shaggy
and
wearing
a
slouched
hat
he
was
holding
a
lantern
in
his
hand
by
a
series
of
pantomimic
gestures
he
assured
me
that
his
intentions
were
amicable
and
that
he
was
anxious
to
guide
me
to
some
place
of
shelter
where
i
should
have
a
more
comfortable
pallet
than
a
bare
rock
i
accepted
his
offer
though
not
without
some
misgivings
as
i
could
not
remember
ever
having
met
with
any
one
quite
so
uncouth
or
bizarre
turning
abruptly
to
the
right
he
struck
across
a
wide
moor
covered
with
gorse
and
innumerable
boulders
and
so
studded
with
pools
of
water
that
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
perpetual
state
of
wading
emerging
from
this
we
wended
our
way
along
the
side
of
a
precipice
at
the
bottom
of
which
roared
one
of
those
mountain
torrents
so
characteristic
of
all
parts
of
wales
beckoning
to
me
to
follow
my
guide
mysteriously
disappeared
and
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
chasm
i
perceived
him
to
my
amazement
making
his
descent
by
an
almost
invisible
and
perpendicular
pathway
for
a
second
or
so
i
hesitated
and
then
making
up
my
mind
to
brave
anything
rather
than
remain
by
myself
in
such
an
unfamiliar
and
dangerous
neighbourhood
i
gingerly
lowered
myself
over
the
brink
and
after
a
few
tumbles
succeeded
in
overtaking
him
just
as
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
we
now
found
ourselves
in
a
valley
of
stygian
darkness
and
of
such
restricted
dimensions
that
the
spray
from
the
river
bathed
me
from
head
to
foot
my
companion
pressed
resolutely
on
and
maintaining
the
same
extraordinary
and
uncanny
silence
conducted
me
to
a
recess
in
the
hillside
where
the
outlines
of
a
bare
dismantled
house
gradually
arose
to
greet
us
it
was
merely
a
pile
of
ruins
old
yet
naked
without
any
of
those
evidences
of
vegetation
one
usually
associates
with
the
antique
i
particularly
noticed
this
deficiency
it
impressed
and
perplexed
me
if
moss
and
lichens
grew
elsewhere
why
not
here
the
situation
of
the
house
was
strikingly
romantic
and
weird
indeed
one
could
not
well
imagine
a
more
dismal
spot
a
giant
mass
of
black
rock
reared
itself
in
the
background
like
a
brobdingnagian
bat
in
the
foreground
and
at
so
close
a
distance
that
the
spray
blowing
madly
over
my
face
and
clothes
drenched
me
to
the
skin
rushed
a
seething
mass
of
sable
water
whilst
to
accentuate
all
this
avernian
horror
the
wind
whistled
demoniacally
and
the
rain
fell
with
fury
turning
to
my
guide
i
impatiently
requested
him
to
move
on
and
take
me
with
the
greatest
expedition
to
the
nearest
available
hostelry
in
reply
he
took
off
his
hat
and
thrusting
his
monstrous
head
forward
revealed
to
my
gaze
a
shapeless
sodden
mass
of
black
flesh
the
cause
of
his
silence
was
now
obvious
he
couldn
t
speak
because
he
had
no
mouth
but
neither
had
he
eyes
ears
or
nose
nothing
but
that
awful
unmeaning
rotund
protuberance
i
stood
aghast
too
terrified
to
stir
almost
too
terrified
to
breathe
with
the
hideous
thing
looming
there
before
me
and
the
booming
of
the
river
behind
it
was
a
ghastly
situation
the
creature
advanced
an
inch
my
blood
turned
to
ice
it
raised
its
arms
my
soul
sickened
within
me
it
lunged
suddenly
forward
and
fell
right
through
me
as
it
did
so
i
heard
a
fiendish
chuckle
which
dying
slowly
out
gave
way
to
a
succession
of
groans
that
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
interior
of
the
ruins
the
figure
however
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
it
must
have
dematerialised
on
the
spot
very
much
relieved
at
this
though
still
considerably
frightened
i
was
now
able
to
use
my
limbs
and
turning
my
back
on
the
ghostly
building
i
felt
my
way
along
the
bank
of
the
river
i
dare
not
glance
at
the
boiling
foam
the
very
sound
of
it
made
my
flesh
creep
nor
did
i
feel
in
any
degree
safe
till
a
winding
of
the
footpath
brought
me
to
a
bridge
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
i
saw
the
twinkling
lights
of
many
houses
i
was
now
once
again
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
a
substantial
meal
by
a
cosy
fire
helped
in
a
good
measure
to
dissipate
my
fears
and
recompense
me
for
all
the
trials
i
had
undergone
prior
to
leaving
the
inn
next
day
i
learned
from
my
host
that
the
hollow
was
known
to
be
haunted
and
on
that
account
was
universally
shunned
after
sunset
half
a
century
ago
the
ruins
then
a
neat
grey
cottage
had
been
inhabited
by
the
evanses
a
bad
thriftless
at
the
instigation
of
her
husband
and
with
the
motive
of
robbery
evans
a
buxom
woman
handsome
in
a
bad
bold
style
had
flirted
openly
with
a
pedlar
known
locally
as
black
this
man
was
easily
induced
to
put
up
at
their
house
and
his
suspicions
being
lulled
to
rest
by
the
amorous
overtures
of
the
woman
he
was
surprised
in
his
sleep
and
butchered
fearing
however
either
to
commit
the
body
to
the
river
or
bury
it
in
their
garden
lest
it
should
be
found
and
being
at
the
time
very
hard
pressed
for
food
they
improvised
an
oven
in
the
earth
and
ate
it
the
vengeance
of
heaven
was
however
close
on
their
track
the
cottage
paid
for
out
of
their
gains
caught
fire
during
a
drunken
carousal
and
evans
was
burned
to
death
whilst
her
husband
only
lingered
long
enough
to
make
a
full
confession
of
the
crime
the
house
was
never
rebuilt
the
phantasm
of
dave
in
the
disgusting
guise
in
which
he
appeared
to
me
still
haunts
the
precincts
and
delighting
to
gull
unsuspecting
wayfarers
leads
them
out
of
their
proper
courses
guiding
them
with
a
fiendish
skill
to
the
black
ruin
the
scene
of
his
ghastly
catchfield
hall
the
midlands
the
terrible
heads
that
rise
through
the
floor
technical
form
of
apparitions
phantoms
of
the
dead

dear
elliott
o

i
thought
you
would
be
interested
to

i
met
blake
last
night
at
the
stowes
where
i
got
out
of
her
with
no
small
amount
of
pumping
an
account
of
what
she
saw
at
that
notorious
ball
at
catchfield
some
years
ago
it
is
very
horrible
too
horrible
perhaps
even
for
such
a
spook
gourmand
as
you
of
course
all
the
names
i
have
given
you
are
fictitious
you
know
there
have
been
several

the
story
my
invitation
to
spend
the
christmas
holidays
with
lady
wentworth
came
as
a
delightful
surprise
imagine
me
a
poor
insignificant
little
schoolmistress
in
rudolphs
suddenly
blossoming
out
into
a
much
envied
guest
at
catchfield
who
can
blame
me
if
i
indulged
in
a
momentary
outburst
of
pride
so
far
my
lot
in
life
had
not
been
all
de
losing
my
husband
shortly
after
our
marriage
i
had
been
obliged
to
do
something
for
a
bare
living
my
education
though
fair
had
fallen
short
of
girton
or
a
degree
and
i
was
barely
qualified
to
teach
any
but
very
small
children
had
i
but
foreseen
the
future
i
might
no
doubt
have
done
better
as
it
was
my
position
was
only
that
of
a
kindergarten
schoolmistress
in
rudolphs
i
do
not
think
you
can
truly
estimate
a
person
s
disposition
till
you
see
how
they
behave
to
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
be
in
subordinate
positions
nor
can
you
always
tell
a
shoddy
lady
from
a
real
one
until
you
have
discovered
how
she
treats
her
governess
and
servants
until
i
taught
in
rudolphs
i
had
no
idea
how
thoroughly
common
were
the
majority
of
its
aristocracy
but
one
term
was
quite
sufficient
to
show
me
that
dealing
with
such
hopelessly
and
innately
vulgar
people
would
be
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
it
was
therefore
scarcely
a
matter
of
wonder
that
when
christmas
drew
nigh
the
christmas
after
my
first
sojourn
in
rudolphs
i
was
almost
beside
myself
with
joy
on
receiving
a
pressing
invitation
to
stay
at
catchfield
hall
nothing
soothes
the
sensitive
nature
of
a
snob
more
than
to
call
other
people
snobbish
the
parents
of
my
children
were
of
the
middle
class
middlish
snobs
with
a
very
big
s
and
should
any
one
need
a
proof
of
the
correctness
of
this
assertion
let
me
point
to
him
the
fact
that
whenever
a
moneyed
person
came
to
reside
within
any
distance
whatever
the
people
i
have
designated
as
snobs
made
all
haste
to
call
on
them
even
the
bishop
whose
object
in
coming
to
rudolphs
was
obviously
only
to
confirm
was
inundated
with
invitations
to
dinner
and
the
rival
claims
to
eligibility
of
those
invited
to
meet
him
were
openly
discussed
at
afternoon
tea
and
bridge
parties
let
me
also
add
that
their
club
ludicrously
labelled
select
boycotted
one
of
its
members
for
some
trivial
remark
true
enough
but
like
so
many
other
homely
truths
better
left
unsaid
and
that
these
very
people
who
had
sat
in
judgment
themselves
indulged
in
the
most
scathingly
rude
remarks
to
those
who
for
certain
reasons
were
obliged
to
grin
and
bear
therefore
i
repeat
again
the
parents
of
my
children
were
snobs
and
being
snobs
would
not
allow
any
one
in
the
humble
position
of
a
schoolmistress
to
say
any
thing
that
might
in
any
way
be
construed
into
snobbishness
depict
to
yourself
then
how
indignant
they
were
and
how
i
laughed
up
my
sleeve
when
i
let
slip
quite
by
mischance
you
understand
the
fact
that
i
was
going
to
spend
christmas
with
my
near
my
very
near
kinsman
lord
robert
wentworth
a
schoolmistress
related
to
a
peer
how
preposterous
how
absurd
how
snobbish
and
they
laughed
at
first
scornfully
then
incredulously
then
pityingly
and
i
i
humbly
bowed
them
out
of
the
house
and
running
upstairs
continued
my
packing
vale
rudolphs
welcome
catchfield
under
these
circumstances
you
can
imagine
why
i
tell
you
all
this
it
is
to
show
you
how
more
than
overjoyed
i
was
at
the
thought
of
eating
my
christmas
pudding
among
gentlefolk
when
i
got
out
at
highfield
the
nearest
station
to
catchfield
my
lord
s
brougham
stood
in
waiting
they
are
very
full
up
at
the
hall
madam
the
coachman
said
touching
his
hat
respectfully
otherwise
miladi
would
have
sent
one
of
the
motors
but
they
have
both
had
to
go
out
longish
is
there
a
i
faltered
giving
one
of
the
horses
i
love
horses
a
gentle
pat
on
the
head
what
didn
t
you
know
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
the
fellow
added
suddenly
recollecting
himself
but
it
is
the
coming
of
age
party
of
the
hon
walter
early
next
week
that
has
fetched
half
the
county
you
see
he
is
the
eldest
son
and
well
madam
there
is
to
be
a
very
big
ball
i
made
sure
madam
knew
all
about
i
shook
my
head
despairingly
balls
were
not
for
such
as
i
had
neither
a
dress
nor
yet
the
money
wherewith
to
buy
one
most
decidedly
i
ought
not
to
have
come
i
glanced
at
the
man
to
see
if
he
understood
my
misgivings
apparently
he
did
not
perhaps
he
would
not
his
manner
at
all
events
was
in
no
degree
less
deferential
and
as
he
shut
the
carriage
door
with
the
courtly
air
of
an
old
gallant
i
compared
him
with
the
parents
at
rudolphs
the
comparison
of
course
being
all
in
his
favour
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
exterior
of
catchfield
it
has
been
done
so
often
and
so
well
in
historical
romances
in
biographies
and
in
county
directories
that
any
additional
effort
of
mine
would
be
at
once
superfluous
and
poor
i
arrived
there
late
too
late
for
dinner
and
partook
of
a
dainty
supper
laid
expressly
for
me
in
the
presumptive
fancy
supper
by
myself
in
a
but
there
was
apparently
a
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
rooms
would
be
used
for
the
occasion
his
lordship
being
somewhat
reluctant
at
present
to
allow
this
handsomely
i
might
almost
say
sombrely
furnished
apartment
to
be
used
for
such
a
frivolous
purpose
remembering
robert
s
sanctimonious
bringing
up
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
his
qualms
my
only
wonder
being
that
he
countenanced
a
ball
at
all
but
of
course
that
was
miladi
s
doings
i
much
wished
to
inquire
why
a
solitary
meal
for
such
as
i
should
be
served
in
a
room
of
such
splendid
dimensions
and
one
that
in
most
households
would
undoubtedly
have
been
used
as
a
but
i
refrained
not
desiring
to
appear
inquisitive
in
the
eyes
of
the
servants
her
ladyship
arrived
as
i
was
finishing
my
second
cup
of
fragrant
coffee
and
despite
a
certain
languid
hauteur
characteristic
of
the
nobility
especially
of
the
modern
nobility
she
appeared
to
welcome
me
i
felt
this
and
yet
somehow
i
was
puzzled
puzzled
at
an
indescribable
something
in
her
manner
that
was
quite
apart
from
pride
something
that
left
me
with
the
decidedly
unpleasant
impression
she
was
surely
acting
a
part
and
yet
why
should
she
why
should
her
ladyship
be
anything
but
frank
with
the
poor
and
inoffensive
cousin
of
her
husband
but
what
was
it
that
made
her
eyes
fall
as
they
encountered
mine
and
wander
furtively
round
the
room
and
why
that
sudden
look
of
fear
that
crept
into
them
as
they
alighted
on
the
fireplace
you
wont
mind
sitting
here
till
bedtime
will
you
she
observed
i
will
tell
webster
my
maid
to
bring
you
your
candle
at
eleven
o
clock
if
there
is
anything
you
want
you
have
only
to
tell
her
all
our
guests
play
bridge
and
i
concluded
from
what
robert
told
me
you
didn
t
approve
of
gambling
so
i
thought
you
would
be
happier
here
we
are
expecting
other
in
a
few
days
so
your
banishment
will
only
be
temporary
you
will
excuse
us
for
a
time
wont
you
what
other
reply
could
i
give
but
o
yes
most
certainly
it
is
indeed
kind
of
you
to
allow
me
the
use
of
such
a
lovely
room
and
lady
wentworth
departed
from
my
presence
with
a
gracious
a
most
patronising
and
highly
gracious
smile
i
was
of
course
charmed
and
flattered
as
any
poor
connection
by
marriage
should
be
but
i
wished
all
the
same
that
robert
had
also
come
to
welcome
me
i
should
have
felt
more
at
ease
with
robert
i
liked
robert
and
well
i
did
not
like
his
beautiful
and
accomplished
wife
had
he
come
only
for
two
minutes
i
should
not
have
minded
but
i
was
tired
i
felt
neglected
and
i
longed
for
kindness
kindness
after
rudolphs
it
was
not
like
robert
we
had
been
such
friends
in
our
youth
children
together
playmates
chums
had
money
and
position
changed
his
nature
money
i
grew
dispirited
i
was
poor
terribly
poor
i
was
lonely
oh
so
lonely
the
room
was
huge
the
night
cold
and
the
fire
small
very
small
drawing
my
chair
close
to
it
i
simulated
ease
i
tried
to
feel
cosy
cosy
what
a
barrier
an
insurmountable
barrier
was
poverty
to
pleasure
would
robert
s
wife
have
banished
a
countess
fancy
a
countess
experiencing
a
reception
such
as
this
a
countess
in
a
vast
room
empty
save
for
draughts
and
a
liliputian
fire
a
countess
i
laughed
i
was
growing
common
like
the
mediocre
parents
of
rudolphs
vulgarity
is
catching
it
is
both
epidemic
and
endemic
had
robert
told
her
i
disapproved
of
playing
cards
for
money
of
course
not
that
was
a
society
taradiddle
he
couldn
t
know
my
scruples
or
he
would
never
have
asked
me
to
meet
his
wife
she
she
had
guessed
my
poverty
by
my
profession
all
schoolmistresses
are
poor
every
one
that
teaches
is
poor
education
must
be
gratis
a
cold
blast
of
air
from
the
chimney
made
me
shiver
the
room
was
indeed
draughty
and
how
still
i
did
not
altogether
like
such
stillness
it
got
on
my
nerves
and
how
dark
why
were
not
all
the
gas
jets
lighted
why
only
this
one
because
i
was
poor
the
poor
should
learn
to
be
economical
and
example
is
better
than
precept
hence
this
feeble
flicker
a
flicker
that
failing
to
reach
the
further
extremities
of
the
chamber
left
the
corners
enveloped
in
shrouds
of
darkness
of
a
black
impenetrable
darkness
i
could
neither
fathom
nor
comprehend
the
furniture
was
superb
but
it
was
of
too
funereal
a
texture
and
colour
to
be
pleasing
to
me
just
then
i
would
have
preferred
something
of
a
brighter
tone
the
floor
was
covered
by
a
carpet
that
must
assuredly
have
been
made
expressly
for
that
room
since
it
stretched
right
up
to
the
skirting
concealing
every
particle
of
bare
board
i
could
not
see
the
pattern
i
could
only
devise
by
the
soft
tread
of
the
carpet
that
it
was
either
of
persian
or
turkish
manufacture
in
some
places
where
kissed
by
the
moonlight
it
was
almost
white
whilst
in
other
parts
it
was
rendered
black
by
a
of
countless
shadows
lying
thick
upon
it
through
the
great
bay
windows
opposite
me
a
magnificent
panorama
of
lawn
meadows
and
rivers
beyond
which
i
fancied
i
could
detect
the
front
of
a
steeple
spread
itself
before
my
eyes
all
this
natural
beauty
lay
enhanced
by
a
thin
covering
of
gleaming
snow
it
was
christmas
the
glamour
of
the
hour
and
season
enchanted
me
past
injuries
and
rudolphs
were
forgotten
i
was
at
peace
with
all
men
at
peace
what
wouldn
t
i
give
if
i
could
always
be
so
if
these
broad
acres
this
noble
mansion
this
stately
apartment
were
mine
mine
all
mine
and
the
stillness
of
the
room
again
oppressed
me
where
were
the
many
guests
miladi
had
mentioned
where
were
the
sounds
of
revelry
the
voices
of
women
the
hoarser
tones
of
men
the
indistinct
murmuring
of
conversation
such
as
i
had
sat
and
listened
to
in
days
of
yore
how
it
had
hummed
and
buzzed
around
me
when
plunged
in
pleasant
reverie
it
then
had
no
more
effect
on
my
hearing
than
the
lapping
of
the
gentlest
waves
on
the
seashore
there
were
no
such
sounds
now
these
massive
walls
were
a
sure
impenetrable
barrier
to
whatever
might
be
going
on
outside
this
room
far
from
being
filled
with
giddy
babblers
was
empty
distractedly
painfully
empty
empty
save
for
the
dancing
moonbeams
and
the
moving
shadows
but
was
it
empty
my
heart
gave
a
violent
sickly
throb
as
i
recollected
the
look
of
disquietude
of
grave
of
indisputably
grave
apprehension
in
miladi
s
eyes
as
she
peered
around
of
what
had
she
been
afraid
of
the
approaching
twilight
of
the
shadows
of
the
gloom
and
as
i
cast
a
terrified
glance
ahead
of
me
i
fancied
foolish
fancy
that
those
palls
of
darkness
i
have
already
mentioned
had
come
out
further
from
the
nooks
and
crannies
and
were
fast
approaching
me
those
of
us
who
have
ever
ridden
on
horseback
by
night
across
some
dreary
wilderness
or
along
a
lonely
road
have
doubtless
had
occasion
to
observe
a
strange
alteration
in
the
behaviour
of
our
beast
its
psychic
propensities
have
been
suddenly
and
mysteriously
awakened
it
fights
shy
of
some
particular
tree
or
stone
or
gap
in
the
hedge
its
ears
twitch
its
flanks
quiver
it
is
all
on
the
tremble
the
slightest
sound
would
now
make
it
take
the
bit
between
its
teeth
and
bolt
it
is
afraid
not
necessarily
of
what
it
has
seen
but
what
it
fears
may
be
there
and
to
an
anomalous
species
of
terror
i
found
myself
a
bounden
slave
i
dreaded
to
think
of
the
effect
even
the
most
trivial
sound
or
incident
might
now
produce
on
my
agitated
mind
had
i
been
able
i
would
have
risked
the
displeasure
of
my
hostess
and
left
the
room
but
i
could
not
every
atom
of
strength
seemed
to
have
quitted
my
body
i
was
cataleptic
paralysed
a
faint
and
almost
imperceptible
movement
suddenly
attracted
my
attention
to
a
square
patch
of
light
on
the
carpet
immediately
before
me
to
my
horror
something
was
coming
through
the
floor
slowly
very
slowly
first
of
all
a
head
a
head
surmounted
with
long
dishevelled
black
hair
then
a
face
god
save
me
from
seeing
the
like
again
a
face
that
might
have
once
been
beautiful
or
plain
or
ugly
but
was
now
nothing
nothing
i
won
t
describe
nothing
but
the
grave
then
shoulders
bust
what
was
once
a
body
legs
held
in
its
arms
in
close
embrace
was
the
figure
of
a
baby
in
a
like
state
of
nudity
and
decay
for
a
moment
only
for
a
moment
they
stood
swaying
silently
to
and
fro
in
the
moonlight
and
then
with
a
snakelike
movement
of
her
body
the
phantom
of
the
woman
glided
across
the
room
vanishing
in
the
recess
containing
the
large
bay
window
after
the
subsidation
of
intense
terror
at
this
hideous
spectacle
i
had
been
compelled
to
witness
the
pulsating
of
my
heart
once
again
becoming
normal
i
was
able
to
reflect
with
comparative
calmness
on
what
i
had
seen
i
say
with
comparative
calmness
for
a
strong
suspicion
now
entered
my
mind
that
lady
wentworth
may
have
anticipated
all
along
what
would
happen
and
that
i
had
been
put
in
that
room
as
a
mere
experiment
to
see
whether
it
were
still
haunted
the
bare
idea
of
such
perfidy
filled
me
with
so
great
an
indignation
that
i
seriously
thought
of
trumping
up
some
excuse
and
returning
home
my
resolutions
being
shattered
only
by
the
opportune
arrival
of
cousin
robert
whose
cordial
welcome
acting
like
a
stimulant
made
me
decide
to
remain
with
a
thoughtfulness
that
had
singled
him
out
from
among
his
companions
as
a
boy
he
noticed
my
weariness
and
putting
it
down
to
the
fatigue
of
my
journey
went
in
search
of
his
wife
s
maid
need
i
say
that
i
was
thankful
to
get
to
bed
and
there
despite
my
ghostly
adventures
i
slept
very
soundly
till
the
gong
went
for
breakfast
at
which
free
and
easy
meal
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
very
charming
guests
miladi
was
of
course
too
much
in
request
to
spend
more
than
a
few
minutes
with
poor
insignificant
me
she
expressed
an
earnest
hope
that
i
had
not
been
too
dull
for
words
and
that
i
had
found
the
room
warm
and
comfortable
at
all
events
she
added
you
can
sit
and
read
there
without
fear
of
interruption
i
know
how
fond
of
books
you
clever
people
are
you
must
go
into
the
library
and
choose
some
you
were
not
disturbed
last
night
were
you
though
this
question
was
put
in
the
most
artless
manner
possible
and
with
all
apparent
ingenuousness
i
detected
a
half
frightened
half
inquiring
expression
in
her
eyes
that
she
vainly
tried
to
stifle
an
expression
which
converted
the
suspicion
i
had
entertained
into
a
conviction
a
conviction
that
this
woman
was
isolating
me
to
serve
some
deep
and
subtle
purpose
i
tried
to
get
out
of
the
lady
what
this
purpose
might
be
but
if
webster
knew
she
most
certainly
showed
no
signs
of
it
being
doubtless
as
accomplished
an
actress
as
her
mistress
as
one
may
readily
conclude
i
looked
forward
to
the
evening
with
little
equanimity
offering
up
fervent
prayers
for
any
incident
that
might
add
to
the
duration
of
dinner
now
i
hate
grand
dinners
as
a
rule
their
regality
unnerves
me
i
am
appalled
at
the
number
of
people
at
the
dazzling
display
of
plate
at
the
multiplicity
of
the
courses
many
of
the
dishes
being
unknown
to
me
at
the
ceaseless
flow
of
conversation
at
the
clatter
of
glasses
at
the
wine
at
everything
but
on
this
occasion
i
simply
revelled
in
it
the
greatest
formalities
appealed
to
me
as
pleasantly
distracting
i
was
poor
my
companions
wealthy
scions
of
the
aristocracy
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
eat
eat
and
be
silent
be
silent
and
listen
listen
and
look
and
i
saw
all
that
one
would
have
wanted
to
see
in
the
atelier
of
the
very
best
costumière
in
paris
or
the
west
end
my
own
dress
was
shabby
but
what
of
that
no
one
seemed
aware
of
it
no
one
noticed
me
i
was
a
nonentity
mute
a
consuming
machine
in
no
one
s
way
because
each
of
my
neighbours
was
far
too
engrossed
in
eating
to
care
about
carrying
on
a
conversation
once
i
thought
a
lady
cast
a
half
enviable
glance
at
my
hands
they
are
my
best
point
particularly
so
when
nicely
manicured
and
once
i
imagined
dear
robert
but
there
that
was
only
imagination
well
the
dinner
like
all
good
things
came
to
an
end
at
last
i
enjoyed
the
dessert
most
the
bonbons
were
heavenly
every
one
ate
them
as
if
they
were
hungry
i
caught
myself
actually
pitying
our
hostess
at
a
signal
from
miladi
we
all
got
up
i
left
the
other
ladies
in
the
hall
they
trooped
away
to
fetch
their
purses
whilst
i
feeling
very
much
like
some
poor
whipped
schoolgirl
slunk
off
to
the
it
was
not
until
the
door
closed
behind
me
i
understood
the
full
horror
of
the
situation
i
was
alone
for
the
second
time
within
hours
in
that
chamber
alone
alone
save
for
those
foul
pollutions
that
might
rise
at
any
instant
from
beneath
the
floor
i
believe
even
then
i
would
have
flown
had
not
the
stubbornness
and
pride
innate
in
all
my
family
restrained
me
come
what
would
her
ladyship
should
never
call
me
a
coward
so
i
stuck
to
my
post
with
heroic
resolutions
much
as
i
suffered
the
previous
day
my
sufferings
then
in
comparison
with
now
were
small
nor
did
the
dreadful
anticipations
that
tortured
me
without
cessation
as
i
sat
there
waiting
for
the
boards
to
part
asunder
in
any
way
surpass
the
awful
realisation
step
by
step
detail
by
detail
the
psychic
drama
was
repeated
in
all
its
damnable
horror
my
recovery
after
witnessing
it
being
slower
on
this
occasion
accompanied
by
relapses
into
a
state
of
terror
too
painful
even
to
recall
yet
i
survived
and
succeeded
in
so
far
pulling
myself
together
that
i
met
the
kindly
greeting
of
her
ladyship
at
breakfast
next
morning
with
a
calm
and
unembarrassed
air
she
did
not
suspect
me
once
again
the
ordeal
came
and
miladi
with
a
refinement
of
cruelty
worthy
of
her
eyes
and
thin
lips
herself
conducted
me
to
the
fatal
you
will
have
company
she
murmured
her
face
shining
white
amid
that
i
must
apologise
for
not
giving
you
more
light
but
for
some
unearthly
reason
or
other
only
one
of
those
gas
jets
will
ever
burn
odd
is
it
not
and
as
her
eyes
met
mine
i
walked
to
the
fire
and
burst
out
laughing
she
was
disarmed
could
any
one
laugh
who
was
afraid
of
ghosts
she
speedily
very
speedily
left
me
and
once
again
i
underwent
it
all
suspense
horror
prostration
i
think
i
suffered
more
this
third
night
than
on
either
of
the
other
two
yet
long
before
morning
i
had
recovered
from
the
shock
i
saw
a
look
of
genuine
relief
rush
into
her
ladyship
s
face
as
she
encountered
my
smiling
countenance
whatever
apprehensions
she
might
have
had
with
regard
to
that
room
were
now
unquestionably
removed
it
must
be
cleared
out
without
further
delay
i
heard
her
remark
to
robert
the
floor
will
take
some
time
polishing
and
remember
the
incandescent
burners
the
incandescent
burners
i
chuckled
what
effect
would
they
have
on
ghosts
i
half
expected
she
would
now
tell
me
why
she
had
been
anxious
i
should
remain
in
the
room
she
was
assured
it
was
no
longer
haunted
why
trouble
about
the
past
but
a
moment
s
reflection
made
me
think
that
after
all
it
might
be
the
past
she
was
most
anxious
to
conceal
hauntings
especially
of
so
gruesome
a
nature
as
this
usually
point
to
some
blot
on
the
escutcheon
to
a
disreputable
something
in
the
history
of
the
house
and
that
is
why
so
many
people
object
to
seeing
their
family
ghosts
appear
in
print
accordingly
miladi
having
the
honour
of
the
wentworths
at
heart
would
take
very
good
care
she
did
not
give
me
as
much
as
a
hint
as
to
what
she
herself
quite
possibly
attributed
to
legends
webster
did
indeed
favour
me
with
the
information
that
neither
her
ladyship
nor
any
one
else
save
lord
wentworth
and
the
old
charwoman
who
dusted
were
ever
known
to
enter
the
room
at
all
events
since
she
had
been
at
the
hall
and
that
was
well
nigh
ten
years
which
information
clearly
implied
that
entrance
was
strictly
forbidden
it
was
interesting
to
speculate
what
course
miladi
would
have
adopted
had
i
told
her
what
i
had
seen
she
was
proud
domineering
and
tactful
would
she
have
the
whole
thing
commanded
me
to
be
silent
resorted
to
bribery
or
what
i
couldn
t
imagine
her
pleading
and
yet
the
honour
of
the
old
aristocracy
is
very
dear
to
them
they
sometimes
value
it
more
than
life
the
next
few
days
passed
agreeably
and
all
too
quickly
for
me
the
playing
element
though
rather
stiff
and
prudish
were
kindly
disposed
towards
me
no
doubt
on
account
of
my
shy
disposition
and
impecunious
widowhood
of
robert
i
saw
very
little
the
host
and
hostess
in
a
big
house
never
have
a
moment
to
spare
to
prepare
the
an
extra
staff
of
servants
was
employed
incessantly
for
three
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
it
was
pronounced
ready
for
the
occasion
i
can
find
no
words
to
convey
to
others
the
singular
way
in
which
the
altered
room
impressed
me
though
stripped
of
all
its
massive
gloomy
furniture
brilliantly
illuminated
with
many
jets
of
incandescent
gas
robert
had
a
strange
aversion
to
electricity
and
adorned
with
festoons
of
oriental
flowers
banners
and
the
gayest
coloured
bunting
it
still
retained
an
air
of
sadness
and
an
indescribable
something
that
nothing
nothing
short
of
total
annihilation
could
ever
eradicate
or
modify
her
ladyship
clad
in
a
snowy
dress
of
the
most
costly
material
trimmed
with
the
rarest
lace
her
fair
arms
and
bosom
glittering
with
the
wentworth
diamonds
looked
like
a
fairy
queen
standing
on
the
threshold
of
an
enchanted
castle
i
looked
closely
at
her
but
could
see
no
remnant
of
apprehension
either
in
her
eyes
or
gestures
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
and
sublimely
unconscious
of
aught
but
the
enjoyment
of
those
around
her
and
the
importance
attached
to
herself
the
handsome
hostess
with
robert
it
was
otherwise
in
spite
of
his
smiles
his
bows
his
many
pretty
actions
of
gallantry
i
could
see
that
the
wan
grey
spirit
of
unrest
stalking
at
his
elbow
never
left
him
he
would
have
staked
his
soul
to
glance
occasionally
at
the
spot
before
the
fireplace
but
fear
lest
some
one
might
see
him
effectually
held
him
back
this
continual
mental
struggle
unsuspected
even
by
his
wife
was
only
too
obviously
apparent
to
me
and
i
seemed
to
hear
a
sigh
of
relief
of
deep
and
earnest
relief
issue
from
his
lips
when
the
orchestra
began
and
now
all
was
symphony
and
movement
there
was
much
glare
and
glitter
and
piquancy
evolutions
spasmodic
convergences
dexterous
extrications
all
performed
and
repeated
with
mathematical
precision
and
untiring
repetition
the
music
changed
the
waltz
gave
place
to
a
novel
and
somewhat
wildly
executed
fandango
it
was
her
ladyship
s
whim
to
include
in
her
programme
exotic
dances
a
resuscitation
of
terpsichore
they
were
undoubtedly
the
distinguishing
and
characteristic
features
of
her
entertainments
raising
them
far
above
the
commonplace
and
gaining
for
miladi
a
and
reputation
she
hated
anything
merely
popular
and
vulgar
in
this
dance
that
now
commenced
and
which
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
there
was
much
of
the
beautiful
the
wanton
the
and
just
a
suspicion
of
something
which
might
have
shocked
a
very
exacting
as
the
greater
number
of
the
guests
like
myself
were
unacquainted
with
it
the
floor
was
left
comparatively
free
for
the
performers
the
onlookers
lining
the
walls
the
doorway
and
the
big
bay
window
never
had
i
witnessed
such
enthusiasm
the
dancers
throwing
their
very
heart
and
soul
into
their
antics
gyrated
and
pirouetted
in
such
lively
fashion
as
evoked
spontaneous
outbursts
of
applause
from
the
delighted
albeit
bewildered
and
somewhat
puzzled
spectators
the
faster
the
music
the
quicker
the
feet
the
louder
the
clapping
and
now
at
a
moment
when
the
revelry
had
reached
its
height
and
the
attention
of
all
was
riveted
on
the
dancers
a
sudden
commotion
in
their
midst
made
everybody
wonder
what
was
it
what
had
happened
i
glanced
at
the
clock
robert
glanced
too
our
eyes
met
and
i
read
in
his
a
deadly
fear
it
was
the
hour
for
the
dead
to
rise
the
space
in
front
of
the
fireplace
was
now
deserted
and
the
dancers
grouped
around
on
either
side
were
eagerly
peering
forward
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
their
alarm
curiosity
repulsion
and
horror
horror
wild
and
undiluted
were
now
depicted
on
every
countenance
as
the
gently
heaving
boards
slipping
noiselessly
asunder
revealed
two
hideous
heads
rising
as
it
were
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
slowly
very
slowly
with
a
gradation
suggestive
of
machinery
the
phantoms
i
knew
so
well
at
length
came
into
full
view
but
stupendous
as
was
the
sensation
this
tableau
produced
not
a
sound
was
uttered
and
as
if
to
accentuate
the
silence
the
music
broke
off
abruptly
dancers
audience
and
orchestra
being
similarly
affected
for
a
few
seconds
the
female
phantom
clutching
in
one
arm
its
loathsome
burden
paused
irresolutely
beside
its
tomb
and
then
shaking
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
honourable
walter
it
made
a
sudden
dart
at
the
spot
where
he
stood
a
thrill
of
the
most
intense
horror
accompanied
this
unexpected
movement
all
eyes
being
now
transferred
to
the
wretched
youth
i
gave
one
glance
at
my
cousin
robert
i
dare
not
look
again
his
expression
was
frightful
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
his
son
his
position
was
that
of
the
damned
the
crucial
moment
arrived
no
one
breathed
the
things
from
the
grave
reached
walter
there
was
no
hesitation
they
passed
right
through
him
i
looked
at
the
wall
i
rubbed
my
eyes
the
spectres
had
vanished
a
convulsive
throb
now
ran
through
the
assemblage
the
revellers
exchanged
frightened
and
embarrassed
glances
there
was
a
general
movement
to
the
door
the
room
emptied
the
dance
was
over
i
did
not
see
her
ladyship
again
i
merely
received
a
message
of
farewell
but
robert
came
to
say
i
wonder
he
said
gazing
at
me
with
his
pensive
harrowed
eyes
i
wonder
very
much
if
the
ghosts
appeared
to
you
when
alone
in
that
room
if
so
you
have
indeed
been
brave
and
to
keep
it
secret
served
us
right
the
story
of
the
hauntings
he
continued
has
up
to
the
present
been
revealed
only
to
the
male
members
of
our
family
but
to
you
i
feel
that
an
explanation
is
due
at
any
rate
you
are
a
wentworth
and
have
given
me
ample
proof
that
you
may
with
safety
be
entrusted
with
a
secret
it
seems
years
ago
that
one
of
my
ancestors
got
entangled
in
some
way
or
another
with
a
beautiful
gipsy
she
begged
him
to
marry
her
he
refused
and
fearful
lest
the
affair
should
leak
out
and
so
bring
discredit
upon
the
family
he
murdered
her
burying
her
body
together
with
that
of
her
child
underneath
the
ballroom
floor
at
least
so
the
states
and
no
one
as
far
as
i
am
aware
has
ever
disproved
it
tortured
with
remorse
and
a
victim
to
the
orthodox
fears
of
a
murderer
my
unhappy
forefather
took
poison
commanding
in
his
will
that
the
ballroom
should
never
again
be
used
for
a
frivolous
purpose
an
injunction
which
until
last
night
has
been
faithfully
obeyed
the
wentworths
as
you
may
naturally
suppose
have
kept
the
story
strictly
to
themselves
the
male
heirs
alone
being
usually
acquainted
with
it
i
did
not
altogether
credit
the
story
of
the
haunting
though
my
father
swore
he
had
seen
the
cursed
apparitions
moreover
he
told
me
that
they
appeared
periodically
every
night
at
from
the
to
the
of
december
he
also
warned
me
and
here
i
am
much
to
blame
on
no
account
to
permit
any
outsider
to
be
in
the
room
for
if
you
do
he
added
then
something
terrible
will
i
own
i
was
sceptical
and
bitterly
i
regret
it
now
i
had
never
seen
an
apparition
and
what
my
father
told
me
he
had
seen
i
attributed
to
suggestion
the
natural
consequence
of
dwelling
too
much
on
the
horrible
details
of
the
story
maud
shared
my
scepticism
and
when
she
wanted
to
use
the
room
brought
forward
the
most
ingenious
arguments
to
overcome
my
scruples
i
declared
it
was
impossible
it
would
be
sheer
sacrilege
i
was
accused
of
inconsistency
i
disbelieved
how
then
could
there
be
any
danger
the
injunction
in
the
will
was
unreasonable
and
absurd
in
short
i
had
no
peace
i
had
to
yield
so
making
the
stipulation
that
we
should
first
find
out
some
means
by
which
we
could
prove
that
there
was
no
foundation
for
the
story
of
the
haunting
i
reluctantly
gave
my
consent
somewhat
to
my
astonishment
maud
had
already
formed
a
plan
for
testing
the
room
she
had
heard
me
speak
of
you
you
were
a
wentworth
if
you
discovered
anything
we
could
rely
on
you
to
keep
it
secret
and
so
my
wife
suggested
that
you
should
be
put
in
the
room
just
to
sample
i
hesitated
i
did
not
speak
i
suppose
my
silence
gave
consent
the
rest
you
know
i
won
t
press
you
to
tell
me
if
you
saw
those
beastly
things
if
you
did
the
sequel
only
serves
us
right
anyhow
nothing
can
excuse
my
having
sanctioned
disobedience
to
that
injunction
in
the
will
the
fact
and
the
nature
of
the
haunting
is
a
secret
no
longer
the
cause
none
but
a
wentworth
shall
ever
know
i
need
hardly
enjoin
you
who
are
one
of
us
to
maintain
silence
on
that
point
we
shall
shut
up
the
house
for
a
time
until
in
fact
the
worst
of
the
affair
has
blown
over
and
when
we
meet
again
let
us
hope
it
will
be
under
happier
we
never
met
again
within
six
months
of
my
departure
both
robert
and
his
son
were
dead
killed
in
a
motor
accident
abroad
the
property
is
now
in
the
hands
of
distant
of
very
distant
relations
and
i
feel
no
compunction
in
saying
what
i
know
about
it
only
if
you
repeat
this
to
elliott
o
donnell

unknown
between
my
exit
from
the
stage
in
up
till
quite
recently
i
had
the
great
the
very
great
misfortune
to
be
a
teacher
in
a
small
town
in
the
north
of
england
i
say
misfortune
because
i
found
the
contrasts
between
exciting
stageland
and
the
monotonous
schoolroom
between
the
generous
and
jovial
theatrical
fraternity
and
the
mean
and
petty
local
parents
too
decidedly
pronounced
to
be
other
than
excessively
unpleasant
i
had
small
patience
with
the
mediocre
abilities
of
very
mediocre
children
and
still
less
with
the
continual
and
unwarrantable
interference
of
their
and
doting
mothers
no
lot
in
life
could
have
been
more
thoroughly
uncongenial
than
mine
indeed
it
would
have
soon
become
unbearable
had
it
not
been
for
the
constant
influx
of
strangers
whose
presence
in
the
town
made
an
oasis
in
the
desert
it
is
to
one
of
these
visitors
miss
medley
that
i
owe
the
following
story
some
years
ago
she
began
i
received
an
invitation
to
spend
august
with
a
very
crochety
old
aunt
of
mine
residing
at
burle
farm
north
devon
there
was
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
appearance
of
the
house
it
belonged
to
a
type
common
in
all
parts
of
england
it
was
a
low
rambling
building
of
yellow
stone
with
a
good
substantial
thatched
roof
and
ample
stabling
the
rooms
sweet
with
the
scent
of
jasmine
and
honeysuckle
compared
more
than
favourably
with
the
stuffy
dens
in
which
i
had
been
obliged
to
live
in
london
whilst
the
and
massive
oak
beams
serving
as
supports
to
the
ceilings
struck
me
as
being
quite
delightfully
quaint
my
aunt
too
a
old
lady
in
a
appeared
quite
in
harmony
with
her
surroundings
she
was
kindness
itself
indeed
no
one
could
have
made
me
feel
more
thoroughly
at
home
folks
do
say
the
house
is
haunted
she
laughed
particularly
one
room
but
there
i
have
never
seen
anything
and
i
don
t
suppose
you
a
ghost
i
cried
how
awfully
exciting
oh
do
let
me
sleep
in
the
haunted
room
and
i
continued
to
plead
till
the
old
lady
reluctantly
consented
you
mustn
t
blame
me
if
the
ghost
should
visit
you
rosie
she
said
remember
i
have
warned
there
is
nothing
i
should
enjoy
better
than
seeing
a
real
spook
auntie
dear
i
rejoined
smiling
but
my
aunt
shook
her
head
reprovingly
and
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
until
the
next
day
i
awoke
that
night
as
the
clock
struck
two
indeed
i
fancied
my
awakening
was
due
to
that
striking
it
seemed
so
unusually
loud
and
emphatic
it
was
a
fine
indeed
i
might
say
glorious
night
for
although
there
was
no
moon
the
heavens
were
so
brilliantly
illuminated
with
myriads
of
scintillating
stars
that
i
could
see
every
object
around
me
almost
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
day
a
sudden
movement
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
made
me
recollect
my
aunt
s
admonition
i
listened
experiencing
none
of
those
pleasant
anticipations
of
which
i
had
spoken
so
boastfully
i
knew
no
one
could
have
entered
the
room
as
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
lock
the
door
having
first
of
all
looked
under
the
bed
and
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
hanging
wardrobe
consequently
my
visitor
unless
a
mouse
or
a
rat
could
be
nothing
material
i
devoutly
wished
i
had
slept
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
a
faint
and
sickly
odour
now
became
perceptible
whilst
the
noise
hitherto
uninterpretable
developed
into
a
series
of
unequal
knocks
just
as
if
some
big
animal
were
lying
on
the
floor
scratching
itself
determined
not
to
appear
frightened
i
put
my
hand
out
of
bed
and
called
trot
trot
is
that
you
trot
being
the
name
of
my
auntie
s
retriever
something
instantly
jumped
up
and
coming
round
the
bed
stood
by
my
side
wondering
whether
it
could
be
trot
though
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
he
could
have
got
into
the
room
without
being
seen
i
stretched
out
my
fingers
and
to
my
intense
relief
touched
a
furry
coat
the
stench
at
the
same
time
becoming
so
truly
awful
that
i
retched
i
could
of
course
have
satisfied
myself
as
to
the
identity
of
my
visitor
by
merely
looking
but
this
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
was
too
great
a
coward
to
do
a
strange
feeling
telling
me
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
something
unnatural
running
my
hand
fearfully
along
the
shaggy
skin
of
the
animal
i
felt
for
its
head
discovering
to
my
intense
horror
that
it
had
none
the
neck
terminating
in
a
wet
mass
of
something
soft
and
spongy
unable
to
restrain
myself
any
longer
i
now
looked
perceiving
to
my
infinite
terror
a
huge
spaniel
headless
and
in
the
most
abominable
state
of
decomposition
i
gazed
at
it
for
some
seconds
too
appalled
either
to
stir
or
utter
a
sound
this
paralytic
condition
continuing
till
an
abortive
effort
of
the
phantasm
to
jump
on
the
bed
loosened
my
tongue
and
i
shrieked
for
help
the
dog
immediately
vanished
my
feelings
had
been
however
so
outraged
by
what
i
had
witnessed
that
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
that
room
my
own
idea
was
to
get
out
of
it
with
the
utmost
celerity
i
did
so
nor
did
i
ever
again
not
even
by
daylight
venture
to
cross
its
threshold
my
aunt
poor
dear
was
very
much
upset
at
the
occurrence
she
could
not
imagine
how
it
was
other
people
could
see
the
ghost
while
she
could
not
and
her
scepticism
was
but
natural
she
was
unable
to
grasp
the
idea
that
the
psychic
faculty
is
a
gift
only
granted
to
the
few
and
as
rare
as
that
either
of
music
or
painting
other
reasons
for
her
incredulity
in
this
particular
occult
manifestation
lay
in
the
enigmatical
nature
and
purport
of
the
phenomenon
in
what
category
of
ghosts
would
one
classify
a
headless
dog
was
it
the
spirit
of
a
dog
that
had
been
decapitated
on
earth
she
had
never
gathered
from
the
scriptures
that
beasts
had
souls
what
then
was
this
phantom
of
a
dog
i
suggested
it
might
be
a
poltergeist
or
elemental
one
of
those
purely
bestial
creations
that
for
various
reasons
which
you
explained
at
your
recent
lecture
always
haunt
certain
localities
yes
i
said
interrupting
miss
medley
the
type
of
elemental
is
fairly
common
if
you
refer
to
the
june
number
of
the
magazine
published
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
you
will
see
an
extremely
well
authenticated
case
of
the
haunting
of
a
village
by
a
white
pig
with
an
abnormally
long
snout
and
i
could
enumerate
many
other
similar
instances
but
continue
my
aunt
miss
medley
went
on
informed
me
that
the
house
had
once
been
occupied
by
a
lady
who
had
lived
a
very
selfish
not
to
say
sensual
life
she
had
settled
down
at
burle
after
having
been
divorced
twice
and
her
weekly
routine
was
one
incessant
whirl
of
pleasure
she
died
without
the
consolation
of
the
church
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
fawning
and
poodles
so
that
for
this
as
well
as
other
reasons
i
think
there
may
be
an
alternative
solution
to
the
haunting
is
it
not
possible
that
what
i
saw
was
actually
the
spirit
of
this
worldly
woman
which
thoroughly
brutalised
by
long
indulgence
in
sensuality
had
gradually
adapted
that
shape
most
befitting
and
the
moral
of
that
miss
medley
i
observed
is
if
you
do
not
wish
to
become
a
beast
do
not
live
like
one
yes
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
a
study
of
the
different
types
of
phantasms
more
i
believe
than
from
any
pulpit
discourses
is
that
your
only
psychic
experience
miss
medley
shook
her
head
no
she
said
i
had
another
very
gruesome
one
at
burle
after
the
dog
episode
my
aunt
thought
fit
to
warn
me
not
to
pass
along
a
certain
road
after
dusk
there
is
an
elm
standing
close
to
it
she
said
which
the
people
about
here
declare
to
be
haunted
as
you
have
seen
one
ghost
you
may
see
another
so
please
be
careful
now
you
might
think
that
after
such
a
disagreeable
experience
i
would
have
followed
my
aunt
s
advice
but
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
discretion
i
disobeyed
her
and
selecting
a
fine
evening
for
the
enterprise
set
out
to
the
tree
as
it
was
two
or
three
miles
away
and
i
was
dearly
fond
of
riding
i
hired
a
horse
and
going
along
at
a
approached
the
forbidden
spot
at
about
eight
o
clock
the
lane
in
which
the
haunted
elm
stood
was
narrow
trees
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
lined
it
on
either
side
and
the
shadows
intensified
by
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
overhead
almost
obliterated
the
roadway
all
was
dark
and
silent
i
no
longer
wondered
at
the
villagers
fighting
shy
of
such
a
place
it
looked
a
positive
of
spookdom
at
about
twenty
or
so
yards
from
the
notorious
elm
my
horse
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
uneasiness
laying
back
its
ears
and
shivering
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
only
by
dint
of
alternate
threats
and
caresses
that
i
succeeded
in
urging
it
forward
arriving
at
a
spot
level
with
the
tree
the
animal
shied
and
had
i
not
been
a
pretty
good
i
might
have
met
with
a
nasty
accident
but
i
stuck
to
my
seat
like
a
leech
and
using
my
whip
smartly
drew
in
the
reins
my
horse
fell
back
on
its
haunches
reared
plunged
headlong
forward
took
the
bit
between
its
teeth
and
we
were
off
like
the
wind
fortunately
i
was
prepared
leaning
back
in
my
saddle
i
enjoyed
rather
than
otherwise
so
mad
a
career
but
my
pleasure
received
a
sudden
check
when
i
perceived
to
my
horror
the
figure
of
a
tall
woman
dressed
in
black
striding
along
by
the
side
of
us
and
keeping
pace
with
us
without
any
apparent
effort
heaven
alone
knew
where
she
came
from
unless
from
the
tree
i
fancied
i
had
heard
something
drop
from
the
branches
at
the
moment
my
horse
shied
as
the
woman
was
wearing
a
cloak
drawn
over
her
head
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
from
the
grotesque
outlines
of
her
limbs
and
body
i
concluded
it
must
be
unpleasantly
bizarre
we
kept
together
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
until
we
came
in
sight
of
burle
when
she
quickened
her
steps
and
tearing
off
the
hood
thrust
her
face
upwards
into
mine
it
was
awful
utterly
and
inconceivably
awful
so
awful
that
i
felt
the
very
marrow
in
my
bones
freeze
with
horror
while
my
heart
stood
still
she
had
no
hair
her
head
was
round
and
shiny
whilst
her
face
yellow
and
swollen
was
covered
all
over
with
circular
black
spots
causing
it
to
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
one
of
those
carriage
dogs
her
eyes
were
black
and
sinister
she
had
no
nose
whilst
her
mouth
was
horrid
the
most
horrid
thing
about
her
with
a
diabolical
grin
she
grabbed
at
my
jacket
and
would
i
believe
have
torn
me
from
my
seat
had
we
not
at
this
moment
in
the
very
nick
of
time
arrived
within
sight
of
the
gates
of
burle
farm
my
aunt
with
several
other
people
was
awaiting
me
and
as
with
a
desperate
spurt
i
galloped
up
to
them
the
infernal
hag
let
go
her
hold
of
my
jacket
slackened
her
pace
and
carne
house
near
northampton
the
man
in
the
flowery
and
the
black
cat
technical
form
of
apparitions
phantoms
of
the
dead
and
possibly
animal
elemental
cause
of
haunting
murder
source
of
authenticity
evidence
should
any
one
wonder
why
i
continually
select
northamptonshire
and
gloucestershire
as
the
scenes
of
my
ghost
stories
let
me
hasten
to
explain
that
my
reason
is
obvious
enough
with
both
these
counties
i
have
had
a
lifelong
intimacy
and
naturally
have
had
more
facilities
and
opportunities
for
collecting
suitable
material
from
them
than
from
any
other
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
other
counties
can
show
equally
long
lists
of
haunted
houses
only
i
have
not
found
them
so
easy
of
access
moreover
the
genial
nature
of
the
inhabitants
of
northamptonshire
especially
has
attracted
as
well
as
aided
me
in
my
research
and
although
the
burly
midland
yeoman
is
inclined
to
scoff
at
things
superphysical
his
satire
is
not
so
objectionable
as
is
that
of
the
supercilious
londoner
again
northamptonshire
is
very
rich
in
well
preserved
old
country
mansions
i
know
of
no
other
county
where
there
are
so
many
and
as
most
of
these
houses
have
at
one
time
or
another
witnessed
some
grim
tragedy
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
are
now
the
scenes
of
occult
manifestations
doubtless
one
would
find
similar
phenomena
in
smaller
habitations
were
the
latter
of
the
same
early
date
for
crime
was
then
just
as
prevalent
among
the
poor
as
among
the
rich
but
the
inferior
material
with
which
cottages
have
been
built
causes
their
comparatively
speaking
early
dissolution
and
we
rarely
find
a
cottage
now
standing
which
was
built
more
than
a
century
ago
from
this
it
must
not
be
deduced
that
hauntings
are
confined
to
old
buildings
nor
that
past
crime
alone
begat
ghosts
nothing
of
the
sort
modern
villas
are
frequently
subjected
to
psychic
phenomena
whilst
the
phantoms
of
suicides
and
murderers
are
decidedly
as
numerous
as
of
yore
but
whereas
in
olden
times
crime
was
fairly
common
in
villages
it
is
now
chiefly
confined
to
towns
and
the
houses
that
have
witnessed
murders
are
not
infrequently
entirely
demolished
or
made
to
undergo
some
very
radical
alterations
hence
the
ghosts
disappear
with
their
surroundings
this
more
so
perhaps
in
the
provinces
than
in
london
as
there
are
too
many
crimes
in
the
latter
for
any
particular
one
to
be
remembered
for
any
length
of
time
not
long
enough
in
fact
to
permanently
damn
the
letting
of
a
house
the
word
ghost
is
very
elastic
it
may
be
used
in
reference
to
many
different
types
of
spirits
and
is
in
fact
only
the
designation
for
that
genus
of
which
the
departed
soul
of
man
is
but
a
species
now
northamptonshire
is
very
rich
in
species
species
of
all
kinds
spirits
of
men
of
beasts
of
vegetables
and
species
of
elementals
elemental
being
in
itself
a
genus
which
includes
many
various
types
too
numerous
indeed
for
any
attempt
at
classification
in
this
work
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
meet
with
some
locality
usually
barren
or
village
generally
on
the
site
of
barrows
or
druidical
remains
as
for
example
guilsborough
where
the
nature
of
the
hauntings
is
dual
a
complexity
that
is
fortunately
of
rarer
occurrence
in
houses
concerning
the
latter
lee
mentions
one
instance
the
gybe
farm
in
his
book
more
glimpses
of
the
unseen
world
whilst
i
will
take
this
opportunity
to
quote
another
case
of
dual
haunting
carne
house
which
is
situated
at
the
utmost
extremity
of
a
village
to
the
of
northampton
my
informant
norton
frequently
resided
in
the
house
in
her
childhood
and
youth
and
it
was
from
her
lips
that
i
heard
the
following
story
which
i
recollect
only
too
well
my
first
impression
of
carne
house
was
one
of
extreme
aversion
i
can
see
it
now
as
i
saw
it
then
vast
sleek
and
white
like
some
monstrous
toadstool
or
slimy
fungus
bathed
in
the
moonlight
for
we
did
not
arrive
till
late
it
confronted
us
with
audacious
nudity
not
a
plant
or
shrub
being
trained
to
hide
its
naked
sides
there
was
something
unspeakably
loathsome
in
the
boldness
of
its
carriage
something
that
made
me
glance
with
fear
at
its
wide
and
gaping
windows
and
glance
again
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
into
the
dark
and
lofty
hall
the
passages
of
the
house
both
in
number
and
sinuosity
resembled
a
maze
they
recalled
to
my
youthful
mind
the
story
of
dædalus
and
i
half
expected
to
see
the
figure
of
the
minotaur
suddenly
arise
from
some
gloomy
corner
and
pursue
me
through
the
labyrinth
nor
were
my
fears
entirely
groundless
for
i
had
hardly
been
in
the
place
a
month
before
i
had
a
very
unpleasant
experience
chancing
one
morning
to
go
on
an
errand
for
my
mother
to
a
room
that
had
in
all
probability
once
served
as
a
laundry
but
which
was
now
restricted
to
lumber
i
was
startled
at
hearing
something
move
either
in
or
on
the
copper
thinking
it
must
be
some
stray
animal
or
may
be
a
rat
i
threaded
my
way
through
a
sea
of
packing
cases
and
standing
on
peeped
very
cautiously
into
the
copper
to
my
intense
surprise
i
found
myself
looking
into
a
very
deep
and
sepulchral
well
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
a
man
i
could
see
him
distinctly
owing
to
a
queer
kind
of
light
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
every
part
of
his
body
he
was
draped
in
a
phantastic
costume
that
might
have
been
a
kimono
or
one
of
those
flowery
worn
by
our
he
was
bending
over
a
box
which
he
was
doing
his
best
to
conceal
under
a
pile
of
and
it
was
undoubtedly
this
noise
that
had
attracted
me
too
intent
on
his
work
he
was
apparently
unaware
of
my
close
proximity
until
satisfied
that
the
box
was
well
hidden
he
straightened
his
back
and
looked
up
his
face
frightened
me
not
that
it
was
anything
out
of
the
normal
either
in
feature
or
complexion
but
it
was
the
expression
the
look
of
evil
joy
that
suffused
every
lineament
before
he
saw
me
changing
to
one
of
the
most
diabolical
fury
as
our
eyes
met
i
was
at
first
too
transfixed
with
terror
to
do
more
than
stare
and
it
was
only
when
crouching
down
he
took
a
sudden
and
deliberate
spring
at
the
wall
and
began
to
climb
it
like
a
spider
that
i
regained
possession
of
my
limbs
and
turning
round
fled
for
my
life
oh
how
long
that
room
seemed
and
what
an
interminable
succession
of
furniture
now
appeared
to
barricade
the
way
every
yard
was
a
mile
every
instant
i
expected
he
would
clutch
me
i
reached
the
door
only
just
in
time
happily
for
me
it
was
open
i
darted
out
and
as
i
did
so
the
outlines
of
a
hand
large
and
shot
fruitlessly
past
me
the
next
moment
i
was
in
the
kitchen
the
servants
were
there
i
was
saved
saved
from
a
fate
that
would
assuredly
have
sent
me
mad
when
i
related
what
had
happened
to
my
mother
she
laughingly
informed
me
i
must
have
been
dreaming
that
there
was
no
well
there
nor
was
there
any
man
in
the
house
save
my
father
and
the
servants
yet
i
fancied
i
could
detect
beneath
those
smiling
assurances
a
faint
and
scarcely
perceptible
horror
and
she
never
let
me
visit
that
room
again
alone
but
was
i
dreaming
was
there
no
well
and
had
that
man
been
but
the
fancy
of
a
childish
and
distorted
brain
sometimes
i
answered
yes
and
sometimes
after
this
little
incident
a
manifest
though
of
necessity
subtle
change
took
place
in
our
household
the
servants
became
infected
with
a
general
spirit
of
uneasiness
which
although
only
shown
in
my
presence
by
their
looks
convinced
and
alarmed
me
far
more
than
any
fears
even
the
most
terrible
would
have
done
had
they
been
outspoken
i
was
positive
they
lived
in
daily
anticipation
of
something
very
dreadful
something
that
lay
concealed
in
those
dark
and
tortuous
corridors
or
in
that
grim
and
ghostly
room
my
dreams
at
night
were
horrible
nor
did
i
again
feel
that
in
this
respect
i
was
singular
as
i
overheard
some
one
remark
that
no
one
ever
passed
the
night
without
awakening
with
a
sudden
and
inexplicable
start
i
say
inexplicable
would
that
it
had
always
remained
so
it
was
august
when
my
next
definite
adventure
occurred
i
use
the
word
definite
as
i
had
had
several
other
experiences
but
of
too
brief
and
uncertain
a
nature
to
enable
me
to
draw
any
precise
conclusions
once
as
i
had
been
walking
along
one
of
the
passages
i
had
heard
the
noise
of
something
clanking
and
had
been
put
to
instant
flight
by
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
echoing
suddenly
in
my
rear
and
again
but
this
isn
t
really
worth
recording
let
me
proceed
with
that
night
in
august
well
i
slept
in
a
room
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
my
nearest
neighbour
miss
dovecot
our
governess
occupying
a
chamber
some
dozen
yards
away
i
do
not
think
i
need
describe
any
article
of
furniture
the
room
contained
every
piece
was
strictly
modern
and
had
been
brought
with
us
from
a
newly
furnished
house
in
sevenoaks
the
fireplace
and
cupboard
are
however
deserving
of
comment
the
former
was
one
of
those
ingles
burns
delights
in
describing
and
which
are
now
so
seldom
to
be
seen
an
inn
at
dundry
near
bristol
containing
i
believe
the
finest
specimen
in
the
kingdom
whilst
the
latter
which
i
always
kept
securely
locked
at
night
was
of
such
dimensions
that
it
might
well
be
termed
in
modern
phraseology
a
linen
room
on
the
night
in
question
i
had
gone
to
bed
at
my
usual
time
eight
and
i
had
speedily
fallen
to
sleep
as
i
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
but
my
slumber
was
by
no
means
normal
i
was
tortured
with
a
series
of
disturbing
dreams
from
which
i
awoke
with
a
start
to
hear
some
clock
outside
sonorously
strike
twelve
as
an
additional
proof
of
my
wakefulness
i
might
add
pardon
my
explicitness
i
was
sensibly
affected
by
a
constant
irritation
of
the
skin
due
i
believe
to
a
disordered
state
of
the
liver
which
in
itself
was
a
sufficient
preventive
to
further
sleep
it
must
have
been
twelve
when
i
heard
to
my
intense
horror
the
cupboard
door
which
i
distinctly
recollect
locking
slowly
very
slowly
open
my
first
impulse
was
to
make
a
precipitate
rush
for
the
door
but
alas
i
soon
became
aware
that
i
was
powerless
to
act
a
kind
of
catalepsy
coming
on
suddenly
held
my
body
as
in
a
vice
whilst
my
senses
on
the
other
hand
had
grown
abnormally
acute
in
this
odious
condition
i
was
now
compelled
to
listen
to
the
thing
whatever
it
might
be
slowly
crossing
the
floor
in
the
direction
of
my
bed
the
climax
at
length
came
and
my
cup
of
horrors
overflowed
when
with
an
abruptness
that
was
quite
unexpected
in
spite
of
the
direst
apprehension
the
thing
leaped
on
the
bed
and
i
discovered
it
to
be
an
enormous
cat
i
can
unhesitatingly
add
the
epithet
black
for
the
room
which
a
moment
before
was
shrouded
in
darkness
had
now
become
a
blaze
of
light
enabling
me
to
perceive
the
colour
as
well
as
the
outline
with
the
most
unpleasant
perspicuity
it
was
not
only
in
intensity
of
colour
the
blackest
ebony
could
not
have
been
blacker
that
the
cat
was
abnormal
but
in
every
other
respect
its
dimensions
were
not
far
removed
from
those
of
a
large
and
its
expression
the
eyes
and
mouth
of
the
beast
were
more
than
bestial
was
truly
satanic
stalking
over
my
legs
its
tail
almost
perpendicular
and
swaying
slightly
like
the
nodding
plumes
of
a
hearse
it
squatted
down
between
the
bedposts
opposite
transfixing
me
with
a
stare
full
of
malevolent
meaning
i
was
so
fully
occupied
in
watching
it
and
trying
to
solve
the
enigma
i
saw
so
plainly
written
in
its
every
gesture
that
i
did
not
realise
i
had
other
visitors
till
a
sudden
uncertain
twitching
in
the
light
made
me
look
round
i
then
perceived
with
a
start
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
a
fire
and
in
august
how
incongruous
i
shivered
but
it
was
no
delusion
the
flames
soared
aloft
adopting
a
hundred
fantastic
yet
natural
shapes
the
coals
burned
hollow
and
in
their
crimson
and
innermost
recesses
i
read
the
future
but
not
for
long
my
cogitations
were
unceremoniously
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
the
whom
i
was
startled
to
perceive
seated
in
the
in
the
most
nonchalant
attitude
possible
nursing
a
baby
anomalous
and
as
is
such
a
sight
in
the
usual
way
the
existing
circumstances
were
grim
enough
to
excite
my
horror
and
raise
anew
my
worst
forebodings
supposing
he
saw
me
now
there
was
no
escape
i
was
entirely
at
his
mercy
what
would
he
do
i
glanced
from
him
to
the
cat
and
from
the
cat
back
again
to
him
of
my
two
enemies
which
was
most
to
be
feared
the
slightest
movement
on
my
part
would
inevitably
arouse
them
both
and
bring
about
my
immediate
destruction
the
situation
did
not
even
warrant
my
breathing
the
minutes
sped
by
with
the
most
tantalising
slowness
the
clock
struck
one
and
neither
of
my
visitors
had
budged
an
inch
the
man
in
the
flowery
still
nursing
the
baby
and
the
black
cat
still
staring
at
me
mine
was
indeed
a
most
unenviable
position
and
i
was
despairing
of
its
ever
being
otherwise
when
a
sudden
transmutation
in
the
man
sent
a
flow
of
icy
blood
to
my
heart
he
no
longer
regarded
his
burden
indifferently
he
scowled
at
it
the
scowl
deepened
the
utmost
fury
pervaded
his
features
converting
them
into
those
of
a
demon
he
got
up
gnashed
his
teeth
stamped
on
the
ground
and
lifting
up
the
child
dropped
it
head
first
into
the
fire
i
saw
it
fall
i
heard
it
burn
the
hideous
cruelty
of
the
man
the
abruptness
of
his
action
proved
my
undoing
oblivious
of
personal
danger
i
shrieked
the
effect
was
electrical
dropping
the
poker
with
which
he
had
been
holding
down
the
baby
the
inhuman
monster
swung
round
and
saw
me
the
expression
in
his
face
at
once
became
hellish
absolutely
hellish
my
only
chance
of
salvation
now
lay
in
making
the
greatest
noise
possible
and
i
had
commenced
to
shout
for
help
lustily
when
at
a
signal
from
the
man
the
enormous
black
cat
crouched
and
sprang
what
followed
i
can
not
exactly
remember
i
have
dim
recollections
of
feeling
a
heavy
thud
and
of
some
one
or
some
thing
trying
to
tear
away
the
clothes
from
my
head
after
which
there
came
a
very
complete
blank
and
when
i
recovered
consciousness
the
anxious
countenances
of
my
parents
and
governess
were
bending
over
me
the
next
night
i
slept
with
my
sister
my
health
had
been
so
impaired
by
these
encounters
that
my
parents
decided
to
move
elsewhere
the
furniture
was
once
again
packed
and
within
a
month
of
the
above
incident
we
had
taken
up
our
abode
in
clifton
bristol
the
history
of
the
hauntings
was
subsequently
revealed
to
me
by
the
owner
of
the
house
it
had
once
been
inhabited
by
a
man
of
the
name
of
darby
who
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
wholesale
butcher
his
elder
brother
dying
the
family
estate
passed
to
the
latter
s
eldest
son
a
child
of
two
and
darby
determining
to
succeed
to
the
property
invited
the
widow
to
stay
with
him
she
did
so
she
was
a
weakly
creature
and
he
got
rid
of
her
by
putting
her
to
sleep
in
a
damp
bed
the
children
were
next
disposed
of
the
younger
by
being
burnt
as
i
had
witnessed
and
the
elder
aged
two
by
being
smothered
to
death
by
a
black
cat
darby
is
said
to
have
deliberately
made
the
cat
sit
upon
the
infant
s
mouth
as
it
lay
asleep
but
these
rapid
deaths
as
might
have
been
expected
aroused
suspicions
the
nurse
who
had
been
an
unwilling
party
to
the
burning
of
the
baby
turned
king
s
evidence
and
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
was
issued
as
is
often
the
case
however
the
officers
of
the
law
were
a
bit
too
late
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
the
quarry
had
flown
nor
could
his
whereabouts
be
discovered
for
many
years
not
indeed
till
fifty
years
after
the
crimes
when
his
skeleton
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
a
disused
well
he
had
himself
sunk
in
one
of
the
back
kitchens
under
the
skeleton
lay
an
iron
box
containing
many
valuables
rings
which
he
had
been
doubtless
striving
to
hide
when
death
in
some
unaccountable
form
or
another
overtook
him
what
became
of
the
cat
history
does
not
say
the
place
had
always
borne
a
reputation
for
being
haunted
it
was
on
that
account
my
parents
had
got
it
at
so
low
a
rental
and
the
ghosts
seen
there
undoubtedly
those
of
darby
and
his
cat
corresponded
in
every
detail
with
the
phenomena
that
had
so
terrified
me
i
am
aware
that
many
deny
the
existence
of
souls
in
animals
let
them
do
so
but
do
not
let
them
be
too
dogmatical
for
where
life
ends
all
is
mystery
still
there
is
an
alternative
theory
to
account
for
the
appearance
of
animal
phantoms
which
is
i
think
quite
within
the
realms
of
possibility
the
black
cat
i
saw
if
not
the
spirit
of
the
one
made
such
hideous
use
of
by
the
old
man
was
undoubtedly
an
elemental
a
spirit
representative
of
a
popular
crime
a
vice
darby
s
evil
genius
that
ever
hovered
at
his
heels
in
his
lifetime
and
is
more
loth
than
ever
to
leave
him
now
that
his
physical
body
is
dead
and
his
soul

the

account
of
a
haunted
house

taken
from
the
diary
of
a
gentleman
since
deceased
the
narrator
was
the
owner
of
the
house
and
being
a
professional
man
asked
me
to
give
fictitious
names
lest
the
publication
of
the
story
should
be
detrimental
both
to
his
practice
and
to
the
letting
of
the
place

i
commence
my
story

writes

think
it
expedient

state
that

died

years
ago

about
after
martha
had
laid
the
breakfast
things
she
went
downstairs
to
finish
a
cup
of
tea
on
her
return
to
the
breakfast
room
she
found
it
in
the
wildest
state
of
disorder
chairs
ashpan
and
front
of
grate
removed
to
furthest
extremity
of
room
all
the
pictures
taken
down
from
the
walls
and
laid
face
upwards
on
the
floor
and
the
cups
saucers
plates
knives
and
forks
piled
in
one
heap
in
centre
of
table
all
this
had
been
done
without
either
breakage
or
noise
terrified
out
of
her
wits
martha
rushed
upstairs
to
our
door
and
nothing
would
induce
her
to
enter
the
breakfast
room
again
alone
march
on
returning
home
about
from
a
neighbouring
town
we
found
the
servants
sitting
huddled
together
half
dead
with
fright
in
the
kitchen
they
had
heard
knockings
and
the
most
appalling
thuds
ever
since
we
had
gone
out
and
on
entering
our
room
no
we
found
it
in
an
absolute
turmoil
the
in
a
promiscuous
pile
on
the
floor
the
duchess
table
turned
round
with
its
face
to
the
wall
the
pictures
ditto
but
nothing
broken
march
awakened
in
middle
of
night
by
three
loud
crashes
in
room
no
after
which
we
distinctly
heard
our
door
open
and
some
one
crawl
stealthily
under
our
bed
we
at
once
lit
a
candle
no
one
was
there
march
knockings
in
both
the
attics
the
servants
badly
scared
march
as
joan
was
running
downstairs
about
she
received
a
violent
bang
on
her
back
as
if
some
one
had
hit
her
with
the
palm
of
their
hand
she
came
to
my
study
in
a
very
exhausted
condition
and
it
took
her
some
minutes
to
recover
march
found
my
mother
s
shoes
which
we
were
certain
had
been
locked
up
in
a
bureau
placed
where
she
had
always
placed
them
in
her
lifetime
on
the
before
the
fire
march
my
mother
s
favourite
found
upside
down
in
front
of
the
in
room
no
april
as
mary
was
stooping
to
look
under
the
bed
for
fear
of
burglars
she
was
suddenly
pushed
down
and
the
mattresses
and
bedclothes
were
thrown
on
the
top
of
her
her
frantic
struggles
and
muffled
screams
being
fortunately
overheard
by
my
wife
i
was
in
london
at
the
time
she
was
immediately
extricated
no
injury
only
bad
shock
april
midnight
the
contents
of
a
large
chest
of
drawers
in
room
no
suddenly
emptied
on
to
the
floor
loud
crashes
in
all
parts
of
the
house
april
on
going
up
to
bed
we
find
room
no
aglow
with
a
pale
green
light
and
filled
with
a
faint
sickly
odour
which
we
at
once
recognised
as
identical
with
that
smelt
there
at
the
time
of
my
mother
s
decease
and
which
we
considered
was
peculiar
to
her
disease
i
must
mention
that
after
her
death
the
room
had
been
thoroughly
renovated
the
old
flooring
replaced
by
new
the
walls
repapered
and
everywhere
well
disinfected
with
the
strongest
carbolic
my
mother
had
died
at
april
the
same
light
and
smell
april
joan
fell
over
some
large
obstacle
in
the
hall
hurting
herself
badly
she
could
see
nothing
but
was
half
suffocated
with
a
stench
similar
to
the
one
already
described
april
both
my
wife
and
i
distinctly
felt
something
brush
across
our
faces
we
lit
a
candle
and
perceived
to
our
horror
two
long
black
antennæ
like
the
antennæ
of
a
monstrous
beetle
waving
to
and
fro
on
our
pillow
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
on
the
chairs
and
sofa
may
shut
up

an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
these
hauntings

personal
and

cause
of
haunting
unknown
in
my
boyhood
days
i
was
very
fond
of
making
long
excursions
on
foot
my
peregrinations
taking
me
many
miles
from
bristol
which
was
at
that
time
my
home
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
took
a
route
that
led
me
past
bath
and
eventually
arrived
at
a
village
that
particularly
fascinated
me
lying
in
a
hollow
by
the
side
of
a
sluggish
river
or
stream
it
presented
an
exceedingly
attractive
appearance
to
my
somewhat
romantic
eyes
i
especially
liked
the
whitewashed
cottages
with
their
thatched
roofs
walls
and
trellised
arches
covered
with
jasmine
and
virginian
creepers
their
tiny
gardens
crowded
with
foxgloves
and
roses
and
their
quaint
their
very
quaint
from
which
arose
spiral
columns
of
smoke
it
was
a
pretty
village
a
peaceful
village
a
village
that
was
rendered
almost
fantastic
by
the
close
proximity
of
a
queerly
constructed
it
was
a
sunny
village
remarkably
hot
in
summer
but
intensely
cold
in
winter
the
stream
to
which
i
have
alluded
ran
its
tortuous
course
through
a
succession
of
open
meadows
in
the
corner
of
one
was
a
pond
a
deep
and
silent
piece
of
water
that
was
supposed
to
be
connected
in
some
way
with
the
miniature
river
it
struck
me
as
a
very
proper
place
for
a
bathe
the
weeping
willows
that
fringed
its
margins
affording
an
effectual
screen
to
the
prying
eyes
of
children
whilst
the
gently
sloping
banks
of
spongy
grass
were
softer
to
the
tread
than
any
towel
to
add
to
my
inducements
the
sun
was
unusually
hot
which
made
the
thought
of
a
bath
very
tempting
after
my
long
tramp
over
dry
monotonous
roads
plunging
in
i
was
however
immeasurably
surprised
to
find
that
despite
the
abnormal
heat
the
water
was
icy
cold
and
that
the
scalding
rays
from
above
did
not
appear
to
have
the
slightest
effect
on
the
temperature
taking
a
few
rapid
strokes
i
found
myself
nearing
the
opposite
bank
and
was
preparing
to
turn
about
when
a
sudden
panic
seized
me
and
fancying
i
was
being
pursued
i
scrambled
ashore
seeing
nothing
and
consequently
assured
that
my
fears
were
due
to
the
trickeries
of
imagination
i
once
again
entered
the
water
and
was
well
on
my
return
voyage
when
i
experienced
the
same
sensation
i
seemed
to
feel
the
presence
of
some
extremely
hostile
and
repulsive
body
something
that
lived
in
the
pool
and
bitterly
resented
intrusion
so
strong
was
this
feeling
that
i
would
not
on
any
account
have
bathed
there
again
at
least
not
alone
in
response
to
my
inquiries
in
the
village
i
learned
that
the
meadow
which
went
by
the
name
of
the
way
bore
a
very
evil
reputation
being
carefully
avoided
by
the
local
people
after
nightfall
though
nothing
had
been
actually
seen
there
those
who
had
attempted
to
cross
the
field
in
the
dusk
emphatically
declared
they
were
assailed
by
an
invisible
something
that
was
indescribably
cold
and
horrid
and
that
they
only
escaped
from
it
after
the
most
strenuous
exertions
nothing
short
of
force
would
induce
a
dog
or
a
horse
to
enter
the
meadow
and
farmers
fought
shy
of
letting
their
cattle
graze
there
indeed
should
any
farmer
be
so
foolish
as
to
do
so
his
beasts
invariably
died
i
suppose
i
looked
a
trifle
sceptical
at
this
as
the
blacksmith
remarked
don
t
smile
sir
if
you
saw
way
field
and
especially
the
pool
after
twilight
you
would
form
a
very
different
idea
of
it
to
what
you
do
now
in
the
it
is
as
you
see
all
sunlight
and
daisies
an
ideal
spot
for
tea
in
the
hay
but
in
the
evening
the
aspect
undergoes
a
complete
change
the
temperature
is
invariably
lower
there
than
it
is
in
any
of
the
other
meadows
whilst
the
shadows
that
crowd
upon
the
grass
are
not
in
the
least
representative
of
any
trees
curious
sir
is
it
not
i
readily
agreed
it
was
curious
and
i
was
so
deeply
impressed
by
all
that
had
occurred
that
years
afterwards
when
chance
once
again
brought
me
in
the
district
i
lost
no
time
in
setting
off
to
visit
the
pond
to
my
astonishment
it
was
gone
and
its
site
was
now
occupied
by
the
kitchen
garden
of
a
large
house
evidently
the
abode
of
some
person
of
means
i
made
inquiries
and
had
but
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
an
introduction
to
the
owner
who
was
not
only
acquainted
with
what
i
already
knew
but
was
able
and
willing
to
give
me
further
information
with
the
stipulation
however
that
on
no
account
must
i
mention
either
his
name
or
that
of
the
locality
he
wanted
he
explained
to
sell
the
place
and
he
could
not
hope
to
get
a
fair
price
for
it
if
the
story
of
the
hauntings
appeared
in
print
i
have
been
here
three
years
he
began
during
which
time
i
have
had
no
less
than
eight
housekeepers
and
servants
my
usual
staff
consists
of
four
that
signifies
a
good
few
changes
eh
yes
it
has
been
a
confounded
nuisance
he
went
on
none
of
them
would
stay
on
account
of
the
ghost
i
the
thing
at
first
although
i
honestly
felt
there
was
something
very
queer
about
the
place
but
when
one
after
another
came
to
me
with
the
same
yarns
i
was
obliged
to
admit
there
might
be
something
in
it
their
complaints
though
differing
slightly
in
small
technicalities
due
perhaps
to
their
unequal
descriptive
powers
were
on
the
whole
frightful
dreams
sudden
awakenings
without
any
apparent
cause
strange
creakings
on
the
staircases
the
of
something
soft
and
indefinable
the
rattling
and
turning
of
door
handles
and
over
and
above
everything
else
the
most
pronounced
feeling
of
insecurity
i
won
t
on
any
account
remain
downstairs
after
the
rest
have
gone
to
bed
one
of
my
housekeepers
observed
on
my
asking
her
to
sit
up
for
me
the
very
first
night
i
stayed
here
before
i
had
heard
any
rumour
of
the
place
being
haunted
i
underwent
the
most
unpleasant
sensations
on
being
left
alone
i
instinctively
felt
some
uncanny
creature
had
begun
to
walk
the
house
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
out
no
sir
i
am
ready
and
anxious
to
fulfil
all
my
other
duties
save
this
and
if
it
is
really
indispensable
why
i
fear
sir
you
must
get
someone
else
in
my
this
i
promptly
did
but
all
to
no
effect
the
newcomer
had
not
been
with
me
a
week
before
she
approached
me
with
a
very
face
i
am
sorry
sir
she
said
i
must
give
notice
i
am
by
no
means
nervous
indeed
i
have
always
laughed
at
ghosts
but
there
is
something
unmistakably
the
matter
with
this
place
especially
the
garden
the
garden
i
exclaimed
come
it
s
the
first
time
i
have
heard
there
s
anything
amiss
with
the
but
not
the
last
i
ll
warrant
you
she
remarked
caustically
why
sir
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
the
origin
of
the
disturbances
lies
in
that
garden
over
there
and
she
shot
a
bony
forefinger
why
should
housekeepers
invariably
have
bony
fingers
in
the
direction
of
the
pond
as
i
was
gathering
some
lettuce
there
last
night
i
felt
i
could
see
nothing
some
horribly
cold
and
sticky
thing
clasp
me
in
its
arms
it
must
have
been
hiding
among
the
raspberry
canes
struggling
with
all
my
might
i
managed
to
free
myself
just
as
a
mass
of
fetid
jelly
was
closing
over
my
throat
and
mouth
oh
how
desperately
i
struggled
and
what
a
blessed
relief
it
was
to
be
free
from
that
loathsome
presence
i
can
assure
you
sir
i
ran
across
the
garden
as
fast
as
any
girl
nor
did
i
pause
for
one
second
till
johnson
and
one
of
the
maids
came
to
my
assistance
they
did
not
ask
me
what
had
happened
bless
you
sir
they
knew
nor
was
a
word
said
about
it
at
supper
no
one
dare
even
as
much
as
mention
the
thing
by
gaslight
it
was
useless
o
donnell
to
try
and
persuade
the
woman
to
remain
with
me
after
that
she
went
and
by
the
bye
i
have
just
heard
she
has
recently
undergone
an
operation
for
tumour
in
some
provincial
hospital
with
my
next
housekeeper
i
was
rather
more
fortunate
she
stayed
with
me
for
more
than
six
months
before
showing
any
of
the
usual
signs
of
restlessness
then
she
came
to
the
point
without
the
least
embarrassment
springing
her
surprise
on
me
over
the
breakfast
cups
i
must
leave
she
said
demurely
proceeding
at
the
same
time
to
pour
out
the
coffee
there
is
a
certain
dampness
here
that
is
very
trying
to
one
subject
to
rheumatism
as
well
as
to
one
s
i
started
guiltily
a
dampness
nerves
you
astonish
me
i
stammered
pray
explain
she
did
so
what
i
mean
is
she
observed
that
i
can
never
enter
the
lower
part
of
the
kitchen
garden
without
being
persistently
followed
by
a
mist
i
should
have
put
it
down
to
mere
imagination
had
i
not
accidentally
heard
some
one
speak
about
the
ghost
and
i
at
once
concluded
that
the
mist
must
in
some
way
be
connected
with
it
am
i
not
right
of
course
i
assented
what
else
could
i
do
i
thought
so
she
went
on
demurely
i
suppose
you
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
your
applicants
the
place
is
haunted
i
shook
my
head
feebly
and
muttered
last
night
she
said
the
mist
was
more
pertinacious
than
ever
it
not
only
pursued
me
in
the
garden
but
came
to
my
window
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
i
was
looking
at
the
moon
when
the
temperature
of
the
room
suddenly
fell
to
zero
the
moonlight
blurred
and
to
my
amazement
i
saw
the
mist
clinging
to
the
i
am
not
a
nervous
woman
as
a
rule
but
i
wouldn
t
stay
in
this
house
another
month
under
any
she
went
and
once
again
i
had
to
go
through
all
the
bother
of
advertising
the
wretched
thing
now
began
to
haunt
more
vigorously
than
ever
it
attacked
emily
the
cook
on
the
kitchen
staircase
and
mark
my
general
factotum
in
the
stables
both
leaving
in
consequence
and
both
being
afterwards
taken
very
ill
indeed
it
was
the
report
of
their
illness
that
prompted
me
to
wage
war
against
the
ghost
if
i
had
to
leave
the
house
it
should
not
be
till
i
had
ascertained
something
more
definite
about
my
enemy
i
would
try
and
discover
its
identity
what
it
actually
was
with
this
end
in
view
i
laid
every
trap
imaginable
my
ingenuity
being
at
length
rewarded
by
finding
a
faint
and
barely
perceptible
impression
on
the
surface
of
a
very
large
tray
full
of
a
carefully
prepared
mixture
of
gelatine
and
wax
i
had
placed
the
tray
in
one
of
the
passages
usually
frequented
by
the
evil
presence
on
examining
the
impression
under
a
powerful
microscope
i
fancied
i
could
detect
innumerable
granules
composed
of
radiating
threads
with
bulbous
terminations
elated
at
my
success
and
wondering
very
much
what
it
represented
i
took
a
photograph
of
the
impression
and
sent
it
to
a
medical
friend
a
bacteriologist
in
london
whom
i
knew
to
be
interested
in
psychical
research
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
came
to
see
me
and
pointing
to
the
wax
tablet
remarked
i
showed
the
photograph
you
sent
me
to
some
of
my
colleagues
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
impression
bore
a
distinct
likeness
to
a
number
of
actinomyces
which
as
you
may
know
are
a
kind
of
fungi
inimically
disposed
to
every
kind
of
animal
cattle
in
particular
indeed
they
are
in
the
main
responsible
for
one
of
the
most
common
and
deadly
bovine
diseases
which
is
called
actinomycosis
and
is
acquired
by
cattle
eating
infected
barley
or
other
cereal
the
actinomyces
adhering
to
the
tongue
or
jaw
in
man
the
disease
is
very
similar
in
its
clinical
character
and
may
be
caused
by
a
number
of
organisms
belonging
to
the
streptothrix
group
i
fear
this
is
rather
too
technical
for
you
forming
colonies
in
the
tissues
and
obtaining
access
to
the
body
from
a
carious
tooth
or
not
infrequently
from
the
tonsil
the
disease
is
sometimes
wrongfully
diagnosed
as
tuberculosis
it
usually
occurs
in
farmers
millers
and
others
who
are
brought
in
contact
with
grain
it
has
a
tendency
to
spread
locally
and
although
not
dangerous
in
itself
may
become
so
by
attacking
important
organs
or
by
becoming
generalised
thereby
giving
rise
to
pyæmic
abscesses
in
all
parts
of
the
body
in
the
description
of
the
assault
on
your
housekeeper
to
which
you
gave
special
prominence
and
rightly
so
in
your
letter
you
mentioned
that
the
evil
presence
tried
to
get
at
her
mouth
well
that
would
be
in
strict
accordance
with
the
of
actinomyces
the
primary
endeavour
of
which
is
to
obtain
a
passage
through
the
lips
furthermore
you
gathered
from
local
gossip
that
the
unfortunate
woman
had
undergone
an
operation
in
some
provincial
hospital
for
tumours
now
tumours
are
usually
one
of
the
sure
indications
of
the
nature
and
progress
of
the
disease
lastly
you
referred
to
fatality
in
any
cattle
allowed
to
graze
in
the
haunted
meadow
now
you
know
from
what
i
have
already
told
you
that
cattle
are
the
favourite
victims
of
the
fungi
from
these
deductions
then
one
must
inevitably
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
haunting
here
is
due
to
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
phantasm
of
a
giant
mass
of
actinomyces
and
as
this
type
of
spirit
would
undoubtedly
be
proof
against
exorcism
my
only
advice
to
you
is
to
shut
up
the
house
and
afterwards
with
a
view
to
corroborate
my
friend
s
theory
partly
for
his
satisfaction
partly
for
my
own
i
am
afraid
o
donnell
i
agreed
to
rather
a
cruel
thing
the
proposal
being
that
we
should
experiment
on
one
of
our
dogs
spot
turning
him
loose
in
the
lower
extremity
of
the
garden
we
took
up
a
position
in
the
loft
of
a
neighbouring
barn
where
we
clearly
saw
each
act
in
the
grim
but
exciting
drama
to
begin
with
spot
did
not
at
all
appreciate
being
left
alone
from
the
very
first
he
manifested
distinct
signs
of
uneasiness
his
preliminary
barks
of
disapproval
speedily
changing
to
those
of
fear
and
culminating
in
howls
of
positive
terror
as
tucking
his
tail
between
his
legs
he
careered
madly
round
the
enclosure
he
did
not
however
keep
up
this
pace
for
long
but
soon
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
flagging
coming
to
an
abrupt
halt
sooner
than
we
had
expected
the
evil
presence
had
we
felt
sure
got
hold
of
him
thrust
back
on
his
haunches
and
snapping
viciously
his
eyes
protruding
and
his
mouth
foaming
poor
spot
presented
such
an
appearance
of
impotence
and
terror
that
i
rose
to
interfere
and
would
doubtless
have
done
so
had
i
not
been
persuaded
to
the
contrary
by
my
medical
friend
whose
professional
interests
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
sentiment
poor
spot
eventually
died
and
our
pointed
to
actinomycosis
his
body
being
literally
perforated
with
abscesses
thus
you
see
o
donnell
in
discovering
the
identity
of
the
phantasm
i
accomplished
in
part
at
all
events
my
purpose
the
cause
of
the
haunting
must
i
am
afraid
remain
a
in
a
subsequent
volume
i
have
attempted
to
give
a
satisfactory
solution
no
hackham
terrace
swindon
the
ghastly
screams
on
the
staircase
technical
form
of
apparition
phantasm
of
dead
cause
of
hauntings
unknown
last
december
i
journeyed
up
from
cornwall
as
usual
to
the
annual
concert
given
by
my
old
school
clifton
college
and
at
the
subsequent
house
supper
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
who
were
considerably
my
juniors
in
point
of
age
we
chatted
together
for
a
long
time
and
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
touched
upon
the
superphysical
you
couldn
t
have
a
better
authenticated
instance
of
a
haunted
house
one
of
my
young
friends
remarked
than
that
of
no
hackham
terrace
swindon
isn
t
that
so
neilson
you
come
from
neilson
agreed
i
know
the
people
who
live
there
my
informant
jarvis
continued
and
they
have
seen
and
heard
the
phantasm
over
and
over
what
form
does
it
take
i
asked
a
shrieking
woman
like
the
ghost
of
tehiddy
i
ejaculated
i
have
never
heard
of
the
ghost
of
tehiddy
jarvis
rejoined
but
i
can
not
conceive
anything
more
gruesome
than
the
hackham
terrace
apparition
let
me
tell
you
some
of
belmont
s
experiences
you
must
know
the
house
is
quite
new
the
belmont
s
being
the
first
tenants
and
that
nothing
has
been
discovered
so
far
that
can
in
any
way
account
for
the
hauntings
to
proceed
about
a
month
after
they
had
taken
the
house
every
one
was
aroused
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
succession
of
the
most
unearthly
screams
coming
so
it
seemed
from
the
basement
of
the
house
for
some
seconds
no
one
ventured
out
of
their
rooms
and
then
belmont
very
pluckily
taking
the
lead
other
members
of
the
family
followed
her
arriving
at
the
commencement
of
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
they
all
saw
an
indefinable
black
object
lying
on
the
ground
frozen
to
the
spot
with
horror
the
belmonts
watched
the
thing
slowly
rise
developing
as
it
did
so
until
it
assumed
the
appearance
and
dimensions
of
a
gigantic
naked
woman
but
what
was
so
inconceivably
horrid
about
her
was
the
face
she
had
no
eyes
their
places
being
filled
by
ordinary
flesh
confronting
them
for
some
moments
in
silence
she
suddenly
and
without
the
least
warning
assumed
a
horizontal
position
in
dematerialised
and
passed
through
the
wall
in
the
guise
of
a
rectangular
mass
of
pale
blue
light
could
anything
be
more
ghastly
it
has
parallels
in
the
luminous
woman
known
as
proctor
s
ghost
wellington
near
newcastle
and
in
a
house
also
new
in
portishead
can
you
tell
me
any
further
experiences
there
yes
jarvis
rejoined
one
of
the
servants
was
breaking
coal
in
the
cellar
one
evening
when
the
hammer
was
unceremoniously
snatched
from
her
hand
the
candle
blown
out
and
a
blue
tatooed
arm
thrust
so
roughly
against
her
face
that
one
of
her
front
teeth
was
actually
loosened
she
screamed
and
the
arm
vanished
still
another
incident
one
of
the
belmont
boys
percy
was
preparing
to
get
into
bed
one
night
when
something
caught
him
sharply
by
the
foot
and
looking
down
he
saw
to
his
surprise
a
large
hairy
hand
encircling
his
ankle
he
particularly
noticed
the
nails
which
though
filbert
in
shape
were
excessively
long
and
dirty
mumbling
a
prayer
the
first
that
came
into
his
mind
he
emphasised
it
by
a
violent
kick
he
could
not
say
which
produced
the
desired
effect
the
prayer
or
the
kick
but
the
hand
let
go
its
hold
and
the
next
moment
a
shapeless
mass
of
blue
something
rising
from
the
bed
and
hovering
for
the
briefest
duration
of
time
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
disappeared
through
the
ceiling
on
another
occasion
when
belmont
was
in
the
conservatory
watering
flowers
one
of
the
pots
behind
her
suddenly
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
she
turned
round
and
found
herself
confronted
by
a
blue
face
that
occupied
the
spot
where
the
pot
had
stood
too
dismayed
and
startled
even
to
think
of
escape
she
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
gazing
at
the
evil
thing
in
horror
what
was
it
though
resembling
a
man
in
contour
and
features
its
expression
was
too
thoroughly
bestial
to
belong
to
anything
human
the
eyes
deep
sunken
and
lurid
leered
malignantly
at
her
whilst
the
mouth
was
distorted
into
a
diabolical
grin
the
apparition
had
no
body
mrs
belmont
is
of
the
opinion
she
might
have
stayed
there
till
doomsday
had
not
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
gardener
scared
the
thing
away
it
disappeared
as
he
entered
the
greenhouse
door
and
its
place
was
once
again
taken
by
the
mrs
belmont
had
another
unpleasant
experience
only
this
week
as
she
was
crossing
the
landing
to
her
bedroom
one
morning
some
one
seized
her
by
her
shoulders
and
pulling
her
violently
backwards
threw
her
on
the
floor
she
was
then
gripped
by
the
throat
so
firmly
that
the
impressions
of
the
fingers
could
be
seen
next
day
and
on
looking
up
she
encountered
the
same
awful
face
she
had
seen
in
the
conservatory
the
hateful
thing
was
now
in
full
possession
of
a
body
which
blue
and
hairy
accorded
well
with
the
strangely
animal
expression
in
its
eyes
mrs
belmont
was
too
fascinated
and
to
struggle
and
she
thinks
she
would
undoubtedly
have
been
strangled
had
not
succour
once
again
arrived
at
the
most
opportune
moment
her
rescuer
this
time
was
bruce
a
very
pugnacious
irish
terrier
nothing
daunted
and
contrary
to
what
one
is
led
to
expect
from
the
generality
of
psychic
tales
bruce
flew
at
the
figure
the
phantasm
immediately
dissolved
into
a
blue
vapour
and
vanished
i
could
enumerate
many
other
occasions
on
which
similar
occult
phenomena
occurred
in
the
house
sometimes
the
eyeless
woman
would
be
seen
gliding
down
the
staircase
or
heard
screaming
in
the
passages
at
other
times
the
blue
man
would
pounce
upon
his
unsuspecting
victims
out
of
some
dark
sequestered
corner
or
frighten
them
to
the
verge
of
a
fit
by
simply
peering
at
them
through
a
door
or
window
the
manifestations
always
terminating
in
a
bluish
the
house
you
say
was
quite
new
i
observed
jarvis
nodded
then
the
history
of
the
hauntings
i
replied
must
either
be
in
some
piece
of
furniture
or
in
the
ground
itself
the
blue
man
with
the
bestial
expression
in
his
face
and
on
his
arms
suggests
to
me
the
probability
that
he
is
a
phantasm
of
an
ancient
celt
possibly
he
was
a
suicide
or
murderer
possibly
he
was
neither
but
is
merely
tied
to
this
earth
by
his
animal
propensities
in
either
case
he
would
hover
round
the
place
of
his
burial
and
his
naturally
ferocious
spirit
would
be
rendered
doubly
ferocious
at
being
disturbed
the
woman
of
course
may
have
been
some
one
associated
with
him
in
this
life
the
lack
of
eyes
the
sign
of
some
dreadful
depravity
in
her
a
more
thorough
solution
to
these
hauntings
will
appear
in
a
subsequent
volume
appendix
to
no
hackham
terrace
swindon
at
jarvis
s
request
i
related
to
him
the
story
of
the
screaming
woman
of
tehiddy
taken
from
a
collection
of
remarkable
narratives
on
the
certainty
of
supernatural
visitations
from
the
dead
to
the
living
impartially
compiled
from
the
works
of
baxter
wesley
simpson
i
chose
this
tale
as
the
least
hackneyed
and
best
authenticated
of
the
many
accounts
i
had
heard
of
similar
occult
phenomena
it
is
given
in
the
original
text
the
extracts
being
taken
from
the
letter
of
one
s
to
his
friend
i
had
occasion
one
day
he
writes
to
visit
the
hamlet
of
barnley
some
miles
distant
from
tehiddy
where
i
was
staying
with
some
relations
my
stay
was
unexpectedly
prolonged
till
a
late
hour
and
having
promised
to
be
at
home
before
night
i
was
compelled
to
set
out
on
my
return
much
after
the
period
at
which
it
ought
to
have
been
commenced
part
of
my
road
lay
through
a
thick
and
lonely
forest
and
i
confess
that
the
task
of
traversing
it
would
have
been
more
agreeable
at
an
earlier
opportunity
my
spirits
were
affected
from
some
indefinable
cause
and
the
chill
dark
journey
i
was
preparing
to
take
did
not
tend
to
raise
them
i
swallowed
a
hasty
cup
of
coffee
with
my
friend
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
and
mounting
my
horse
was
soon
at
a
considerable
distance
from
his
house
i
was
approaching
the
verge
of
the
forest
and
had
just
entered
a
narrow
outlet
from
it
when
i
heard
the
roll
of
distant
thunder
and
felt
the
wet
and
heavy
droppings
of
a
copious
rain
having
scarcely
a
league
farther
to
travel
before
i
reached
home
i
determined
to
urge
my
horse
to
the
utmost
and
escape
if
possible
by
his
speed
from
the
impending
storm
he
broke
at
once
into
a
gallop
when
i
struck
him
with
the
spur
but
had
scarcely
gone
a
hundred
paces
before
i
was
thrown
from
the
saddle
by
his
abrupt
stopping
and
pitched
with
the
greatest
violence
to
the
ground
i
lay
stunned
for
a
few
moments
by
the
fall
the
first
thing
that
brought
me
to
a
sense
of
my
situation
was
a
uttered
by
some
person
who
breathed
close
to
my
ear
the
rein
which
i
had
continued
to
grasp
in
falling
was
at
that
moment
torn
violently
out
of
my
hand
i
heard
the
noise
of
my
courser
s
hoofs
as
he
started
back
the
scream
was
repeated
and
something
rushed
past
me
that
clanked
as
it
went
like
a
horseman
s
heavy
sabre
i
sprang
up
from
the
earth
and
threw
out
my
arms
to
ascertain
if
any
individual
were
actually
passing
but
the
avenue
was
so
narrow
that
i
touched
the
hedges
on
each
side
of
it
and
felt
instantly
convinced
that
nothing
human
could
have
gone
by
a
recollection
now
flashed
upon
me
that
there
was
a
tale
of
extreme
horror
connected
with
this
part
of
the
forest
and
in
spite
of
the
principles
which
i
summoned
to
my
aid
it
was
in
a
mood
of
mingled
desperation
and
amazement
that
i
reflected
on
the
circumstances
with
which
my
memory
supplied
me
the
infirmary
of
tehiddy
about
twenty
years
ago
contained
a
female
patient
who
was
known
by
the
name
of
martha
and
had
been
admitted
to
that
asylum
at
the
instance
of
a
stranger
he
stated
himself
to
be
her
husband
and
assured
the
director
of
the
institution
with
the
appearance
of
the
deepest
sorrow
that
she
laboured
under
a
lunacy
of
the
most
stubborn
sort
which
nothing
but
the
most
severe
discipline
attributed
to
his
house
was
likely
to
abate
he
advanced
a
large
sum
for
the
maintenance
of
this
unhappy
creature
saw
her
lodged
in
one
of
the
strongest
cells
of
the
establishment
and
having
recommended
an
unsparing
use
of
the
scourge
thought
proper
to
depart
his
meaning
was
not
misunderstood
the
shrieks
of
poor
martha
were
heard
day
and
night
in
the
vicinity
of
her
dungeon
and
suspicions
soon
prevailed
that
she
was
being
sacrificed
to
the
cruelty
of
her
merciless
keepers
an
investigation
of
the
case
was
proposed
by
some
humane
and
spirited
people
but
a
calamity
of
the
most
awful
kind
put
a
stop
to
their
endeavours
martha
was
found
dead
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
at
the
very
spot
i
have
described
to
you
a
piece
of
ragged
iron
being
clenched
in
her
grasp
with
which
she
had
torn
and
gashed
her
throat
in
a
dreadful
manner
the
escape
of
this
wretched
being
was
never
well
explained
and
hints
were
dropped
that
she
had
not
left
the
prison
alive
her
bloody
and
mangled
remains
excited
a
strong
sensation
among
those
who
inspected
them
marks
of
the
chain
and
the
whip
were
conspicuous
on
every
part
of
her
body
and
long
tufts
of
her
thin
grey
hair
were
glued
together
by
the
stream
that
had
issued
from
a
deep
fracture
in
her
head
the
tokens
of
suicide
however
were
undeniable
and
the
remains
of
the
poor
maniac
were
in
consequence
buried
near
the
place
where
they
were
found
this
occurrence
had
scarcely
ceased
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
when
the
whole
town
of
tehiddy
was
agitated
by
events
of
a
yet
more
appalling
character
were
heard
in
the
still
dark
hours
of
night
and
a
pale
bloodless
face
was
seen
pressing
against
several
of
the
chamber
windows
fraud
or
delusion
were
naturally
suspected
in
a
business
of
this
nature
and
the
most
scrutinising
inquiries
were
made
into
the
evidence
on
which
it
rested
no
detection
took
place
and
the
screams
soon
became
so
frequent
that
not
a
person
continued
to
question
their
existence
it
was
midnight
when
i
reached
home
exhausted
by
anxiety
and
fatigue
and
being
provided
with
a
key
to
my
apartments
the
people
of
the
house
had
not
waited
up
to
receive
me
i
drew
off
my
boots
and
upper
coat
as
a
preliminary
to
the
act
of
undressing
and
seated
myself
in
a
large
antique
chair
from
which
when
divested
of
my
clothes
i
usually
stepped
into
bed
here
i
fell
asleep
owing
to
excessive
weariness
and
may
the
next
slumber
that
is
likely
to
end
in
so
horrible
a
way
be
never
broken
a
dream
was
upon
me
full
of
blood
and
death
the
shrieking
maniac
flitted
through
my
brain
in
a
thousand
forms
and
seemed
at
one
time
to
stand
over
me
brandishing
a
sword
of
fire
the
next
moment
i
lay
benumbed
as
it
were
in
my
seat
while
the
maniac
advanced
from
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
bearing
in
her
right
hand
a
human
skull
replete
with
some
poisonous
sort
of
drink
this
horrible
potion
was
lifted
to
my
lips
which
seemed
to
shut
in
vain
against
it
the
long
bony
fingers
of
the
phantom
being
thrust
into
my
mouth
so
as
to
force
a
passage
for
her
accursed
mixture
it
trickled
down
to
my
very
heart
in
slow
cold
drops
and
when
lodged
there
seemed
by
a
sudden
transition
to
burn
and
glow
like
flames
of
etna
spellbound
as
i
was
such
extreme
agony
passed
my
powers
of
endurance
i
uttered
a
frantic
cry
and
sprang
up
from
the
chair
darting
towards
the
hag
by
whom
my
torment
was
inflicted
the
glare
of
her
red
eyes
grew
stronger
as
i
advanced
and
a
lean
sallow
arm
was
put
out
to
repel
me
fearing
the
detested
touch
i
hastily
drew
back
some
article
of
furniture
intercepted
me
i
fell
and
was
plunged
from
the
fall
into
a
chasm
which
opened
through
the
floor
the
shock
of
this
awoke
me
and
the
first
proof
i
obtained
of
my
actual
perception
was
the
sound
of
that
which
a
few
hours
before
had
been
uttered
in
the
forest
this
scream
was
repeated
it
seemed
to
issue
from
the
windows
i
heard
the
casement
flap
as
if
a
strong
wind
were
shaking
it
and
though
my
sinews
shrank
and
withered
at
the
noise
yet
i
staggered
to
this
window
as
fast
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
a
ray
of
light
flashed
in
as
i
reached
it
and
there
pressed
close
against
the
glass
i
saw
the
same
pale
bloodless
visage
that
has
been
already
figured
to
you
maddened
by
the
sight
i
clenched
my
hand
and
drove
it
fiercely
at
the
apparition
its
lips
quivered
the
rang
again
through
the
apartment
i
was
found
next
day
without
sense
or
motion
my
hand
dreadfully
cut
and
the
window
shivered

the
following
story
is
told
in
the
language
of
the
the
quaintness
of
his
style
being
accounted
for
by
the
period
in
which
he
lived
i
was
always
a
very
man
and
until
the
time
about
which
i
am
going
to
speak
always
ridiculed
the
idea
of
ghosts
you
must
know
that
about
two
years
ago
i
went
to
lodge
at
an
ancient
house
in
westminster
where
nothing
remarkable
happened
to
me
for
about
three
months
and
then
on
a
night
in
november
too
well
do
i
remember
it
i
saw
such
an
appalling
sight
as
i
never
before
beheld
probably
ed
even
were
i
starving
i
would
not
again
enter
that
room
no
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
had
been
to
the
theatre
and
on
my
way
home
had
drunk
a
single
pint
of
porter
so
that
no
doubt
of
my
sobriety
can
exist
for
a
moment
my
room
was
on
the
second
storey
of
a
house
that
i
should
suppose
had
weathered
four
hundred
years
and
was
in
former
days
an
isolated
habitation
the
room
surrounded
by
a
wainscoting
of
oak
to
the
height
of
five
feet
was
very
lofty
and
even
in
the
lightest
days
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
windows
was
extremely
gloomy
as
i
said
before
i
returned
from
the
theatre
and
the
snuff
of
the
candle
which
i
had
extinguished
on
getting
into
bed
had
not
ceased
to
emit
its
disagreeable
effluvia
when
i
beheld
my
blood
freezes
when
i
think
of
it
a
young
man
dressed
in
the
habit
of
days
gone
by
gliding
through
the
wainscoting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
apartment
to
where
i
lay
i
was
completely
paralysed
trembled
violently
in
every
limb
and
the
perspiration
fell
in
torrents
from
my
brows
i
felt
for
some
time
as
if
every
nerve
was
cut
asunder
and
every
sense
benumbed
i
exerted
myself
to
speak
but
in
vain
my
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
i
was
obliged
to
remain
a
and
inactive
spectator
of
the
scene
before
me
the
apparition
remained
for
nearly
ten
minutes
which
was
ample
time
for
me
to
convince
myself
that
it
was
no
idle
chimera
of
a
diseased
imagination
that
stood
before
me
yet
although
it
remained
so
long
a
time
i
could
not
command
sufficient
resolution
to
challenge
it
or
summon
any
one
to
my
aid
for
i
felt
as
though
deprived
of
all
energy
and
in
fact
i
was
so
during
the
whole
time
of
its
visit
though
my
sense
of
perception
and
consciousness
were
painfully
acute
the
expression
of
the
countenance
was
peculiarly
mild
and
the
rich
dark
locks
falling
about
the
forehead
and
shoulders
and
the
mustachios
of
the
same
hue
showed
in
horrid
relief
against
the
ashy
chilling
and
livid
hue
of
the
face
he
wore
a
doublet
of
a
kind
of
chocolate
colour
richly
embroidered
with
gold
lace
full
loose
breeches
of
a
yellow
leather
ornamented
uniformly
with
the
doublet
and
from
each
was
suspended
a
bunch
of
ribbon
adorned
with
a
metal
tag
reaching
down
nearly
to
the
broad
and
drooping
tops
of
his
light
russet
boots
a
large
of
dark
blue
cloth
reached
from
the
shoulders
down
to
the
heels
hanging
in
full
folds
over
the
left
arm
which
was
extended
towards
the
fireplace
of
my
apartment
while
i
was
gazing
on
him
in
stupid
astonishment
and
terror
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
lifting
from
his
head
his
broad
hat
discovered
to
my
agonising
sight
a
deep
and
bloody
wound
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
this
action
he
then
followed
up
with
sighs
and
gesticulations
which
although
i
could
not
clearly
understand
were
apparently
intended
to
warn
me
of
some
impending
danger
harrowing
as
the
sight
was
to
my
feelings
it
was
a
mere
nothing
to
what
i
suffered
when
i
beheld
him
advance
slowly
and
almost
imperceptibly
towards
the
spot
where
i
lay
and
fixing
his
dark
piercing
gaze
upon
me
for
nearly
a
minute
hold
me
in
a
more
painful
and
horrid
inactivity
than
that
in
which
the
basilisk
is
said
to
hold
its
victim
although
i
knew
from
the
expression
in
his
eyes
he
wished
me
to
speak
and
much
as
i
desired
to
hear
from
him
some
of
the
mysteries
attached
to
the
superphysical
world
i
could
not
articulate
a
sound
a
phenomenon
which
i
have
since
learned
invariably
happens
to
psychists
at
the
crucial
moment
at
length
he
retired
towards
the
wainscot
and
raising
both
his
hands
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
remained
apparently
wrapped
in
deep
contemplation
for
nearly
three
minutes
and
then
suddenly
disappeared
sinking
into
the
floor
at
the
bottom
of
the
wainscotting
as
you
may
well
suppose
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
again
that
night
but
as
soon
as
it
was
light
i
proceeded
to
my
landlord
s
room
roused
him
and
demanded
to
settle
my
account
for
i
determined
in
my
own
mind
never
to
the
house
which
was
visited
in
so
superhuman
a
manner
with
astonishment
in
his
countenance
he
received
the
amount
of
my
rent
at
the
same
time
inquiring
what
had
caused
this
sudden
aversion
to
my
apartment
i
answered
evasively
and
as
i
left
him
i
thought
i
observed
a
kind
of
lurking
consciousness
of
something
wrong
in
his
countenance
which
led
me
to
surmise
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
mysterious
visits
of
the
apparition
and
so
it
proved
in
the
end
for
happening
to
meet
him
one
day
in
the
park
i
inveigled
him
into
confessing
that
it
was
reported
in
the
neighbourhood
that
the
house
and
particularly
the
room
in
which
i
slept
was
haunted
by
the
troubled
spirit
of
a
young
cavalier
of
king
charles
the
second
s
days
said
to
have
been
murdered
there
and
he
added
during
the
time
he
had
kept
the
house
no
less
than
nine
people
had
left
the
apartment
on
account
of
the
disturbances
he
had
concealed
this
from
me
he
concluded
fearing
i
might
add
one
more
to
the
list
of
lodgers
scared
away
by
the
supernatural
glossary
elemental
otherwise
known
as
poltergeist
there

many
species
of
this
genus
of
spirit

me
to
