conclusion
chapter
i
folking
perhaps
it
was
more
the
fault
of
daniel
caldigate
the
father
than
of
his
son
john
caldigate
that
they
two
could
not
live
together
in
comfort
in
the
days
of
the
young
man
early
youth
and
yet
it
would
have
been
much
for
both
of
them
that
such
comfortable
association
should
have
been
possible
to
them
wherever
the
fault
lay
or
the
chief
fault
for
probably
there
was
some
on
both
sides
the
misfortune
was
so
great
as
to
bring
crushing
troubles
upon
each
of
them
there
were
but
the
two
of
which
to
make
a
household
when
john
was
fifteen
and
had
been
about
a
year
at
harrow
he
lost
his
mother
and
his
two
little
sisters
almost
at
a
blow
the
two
girls
went
first
and
the
poor
mother
who
had
kept
herself
alive
to
see
them
die
followed
them
almost
instantly
then
daniel
caldigate
had
been
alone
and
he
was
a
man
who
knew
how
to
live
alone
a
just
hard
unsympathetic
man
of
whom
his
neighbours
said
with
something
of
implied
reproach
that
he
bore
up
strangely
when
he
lost
his
wife
and
girls
this
they
said
because
he
was
to
be
seen
riding
about
the
country
and
because
he
was
to
be
heard
talking
to
the
farmers
and
labourers
as
though
nothing
special
had
happened
to
him
it
was
rumoured
of
him
too
that
he
was
as
constant
with
his
books
as
before
and
he
had
been
a
man
always
constant
with
his
books
and
also
that
he
had
never
been
seen
to
shed
a
tear
or
been
heard
to
speak
of
those
who
had
been
taken
from
him
he
was
in
truth
a
stout
man
silent
unless
when
he
had
something
to
say
then
he
could
become
loud
enough
or
perhaps
it
might
be
said
eloquent
to
his
wife
he
had
been
inwardly
affectionate
but
outwardly
almost
stern
to
his
daughters
he
had
been
the
same
always
anxious
for
every
good
thing
on
their
behalf
but
never
able
to
make
the
children
conscious
of
this
anxiety
when
they
were
taken
from
him
he
suffered
in
silence
as
such
men
do
suffer
and
he
suffered
the
more
because
he
knew
well
how
little
of
gentleness
there
had
been
in
his
manners
with
them
but
he
had
hoped
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
desolate
house
that
it
would
be
different
with
him
and
his
only
son
with
his
son
who
was
now
the
only
thing
left
to
him
but
the
son
was
a
boy
and
he
had
to
look
forward
to
what
years
might
bring
him
rather
than
to
present
happiness
from
that
source
when
the
boy
came
home
for
his
holidays
the
father
would
sometimes
walk
with
him
and
discourse
on
certain
chosen
subjects
on
the
politics
of
the
day
in
regard
to
which
caldigate
was
an
advanced
liberal
on
the
abomination
of
the
game
laws
on
the
folly
of
protection
on
the
antiquated
absurdity
of
a
state
church
as
to
all
which
matters
his
son
john
lent
him
a
very
inattentive
ear
then
the
lad
would
escape
and
kill
rabbits
or
rats
or
even
take
nests
with
a
zest
for
such
pursuits
which
was
disgusting
to
the
father
though
he
would
not
absolutely
forbid
them
then
john
would
be
allured
to
go
to
his
uncle
babington
house
where
there
was
a
pony
on
which
he
could
hunt
and
and
a
lake
with
a
boat
and
three
fine
bouncing
who
made
much
of
him
and
called
him
jack
so
that
he
soon
preferred
his
uncle
babington
house
and
would
spend
much
of
his
holidays
at
babington
house
caldigate
was
a
country
squire
with
a
moderate
income
living
in
a
moderate
house
called
folking
in
the
parish
of
utterden
about
ten
miles
from
cambridge
here
he
owned
nearly
the
entire
parish
and
some
portion
of
netherden
which
lay
next
to
it
having
the
reputation
of
an
income
of
it
probably
amounted
to
about
of
that
early
in
life
he
had
been
a
very
poor
man
owing
to
the
improvidence
of
his
father
but
he
had
soon
quarrelled
with
his
father
as
he
had
with
almost
everyone
else
and
had
for
some
ten
years
earned
his
own
bread
in
the
metropolis
among
the
magazines
and
newspapers
then
when
his
father
died
the
property
was
his
own
with
such
encumbrances
as
the
old
squire
had
been
able
to
impose
upon
it
daniel
caldigate
had
married
when
he
was
a
poor
man
but
did
not
go
to
folking
to
live
till
the
estate
was
clear
at
which
time
he
was
forty
years
old
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
inculcate
good
liberal
principles
into
that
son
of
his
who
was
burning
the
while
to
get
off
to
a
battle
of
rats
among
the
he
was
not
yet
fifty
there
might
therefore
be
some
time
left
to
him
for
the
promised
joys
of
companionship
if
he
could
only
convince
the
boy
that
politics
were
better
than
rats
but
he
did
not
long
make
himself
any
such
promise
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
son
mind
was
of
a
nature
very
different
from
his
own
and
much
like
to
that
of
his
grandfather
the
lad
could
be
awakened
to
no
enthusiasm
in
the
abuse
of
conservative
leaders
and
those
babingtons
were
such
fools
he
despised
the
whole
race
of
them
especially
those
romping
damsels
of
whom
no
doubt
his
son
would
marry
one
they
were
all
of
the
earth
earthy
without
an
idea
among
them
and
yet
he
did
not
dare
to
forbid
his
son
to
go
to
the
house
lest
people
should
say
of
him
that
his
sternness
was
unendurable
folking
is
not
a
place
having
many
attractions
of
its
own
beyond
the
rats
it
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
cambridgeshire
fens
between
ives
cambridge
and
ely
in
the
two
parishes
of
utterden
and
netherden
there
is
no
rise
of
ground
which
can
by
any
stretch
of
complaisance
be
called
a
hill
the
property
is
bisected
by
an
immense
straight
dike
which
is
called
the
middle
wash
and
which
is
so
sluggish
so
straight
so
ugly
and
so
deep
as
to
impress
the
mind
of
a
stranger
with
the
ideas
of
suicide
and
there
are
straight
roads
and
straight
dikes
with
ugly
names
on
all
sides
and
passages
through
the
country
called
droves
also
with
ugly
appellations
of
their
own
which
certainly
are
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
roads
the
folking
causeway
possesses
a
bridge
across
the
wash
and
is
said
to
be
the
remains
of
an
old
roman
way
which
ran
in
a
perfectly
direct
line
from
neots
to
ely
when
you
have
crossed
the
bridge
going
northward
or
there
is
a
lodge
at
your
right
hand
and
a
private
road
running
as
straight
as
a
line
can
be
drawn
through
pollard
poplars
up
to
caldigate
house
round
the
house
there
are
meadows
and
a
large
kitchen
garden
and
a
small
dark
with
clipt
hedges
and
straight
walks
quite
in
the
old
fashion
the
house
itself
is
dark
picturesque
low
and
uncomfortable
part
of
it
is
as
old
as
the
time
of
charles
and
part
dates
from
queen
anne
something
was
added
at
a
later
date
perhaps
early
in
the
georges
but
it
was
all
done
with
good
materials
and
no
stint
of
labour
shoddy
had
not
been
received
among
building
materials
when
any
portion
of
folking
was
erected
but
then
neither
had
modern
ideas
of
comfort
become
in
vogue
just
behind
the
a
great
cross
ditch
called
drain
runs
or
rather
creeps
down
to
the
wash
looking
on
that
side
as
though
it
had
been
made
to
act
as
a
moat
to
the
house
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
drain
there
is
twopenny
drove
at
the
end
of
which
twopenny
ferry
leads
to
twopenny
hall
a
farmhouse
across
the
wash
belonging
to
caldigate
the
fields
around
are
all
square
and
all
flat
all
mostly
arable
and
are
often
so
deep
in
mud
that
a
stranger
wonders
that
a
plough
should
be
able
to
be
dragged
through
the
soil
the
farming
is
however
good
of
its
kind
and
the
ploughing
is
mostly
done
by
steam
such
is
and
has
been
for
some
years
the
house
at
folking
in
which
caldigate
has
lived
quite
alone
for
five
years
after
his
wife
death
he
had
only
on
rare
occasions
received
visitors
there
twice
his
brother
had
come
to
folking
and
had
brought
a
son
with
him
the
brother
had
been
a
fellow
of
a
college
at
cambridge
and
had
taken
a
living
and
married
late
in
life
the
living
was
far
away
in
dorsetshire
and
the
son
at
the
time
of
these
visits
was
being
educated
at
a
private
school
twice
they
had
both
been
at
folking
together
and
the
uncle
had
in
his
silent
way
liked
the
boy
the
lad
had
preferred
or
had
pretended
to
prefer
books
to
rats
had
understood
or
seemed
to
understand
something
of
the
advantages
of
cheap
food
for
the
people
and
had
been
commended
by
the
father
for
general
good
conduct
but
when
they
had
last
taken
their
departure
from
folking
no
one
had
entertained
any
idea
of
any
peculiar
relations
between
the
nephew
and
the
uncle
it
was
not
till
a
year
or
two
more
had
run
by
that
daniel
caldigate
thought
of
making
his
nephew
george
the
heir
to
the
property
the
property
indeed
was
entailed
upon
john
as
it
had
been
entailed
upon
john
father
there
were
many
institutions
of
his
country
which
caldigate
hated
with
almost
an
inhuman
hatred
but
there
were
none
more
odious
to
him
than
that
of
entails
which
institution
he
was
wont
to
prove
by
many
arguments
to
be
the
source
of
all
the
ignorance
and
all
the
poverty
and
all
the
troubles
by
which
his
country
was
inflicted
he
had
got
his
own
property
by
an
entail
and
certainly
never
would
have
had
an
acre
had
his
father
been
able
to
consume
more
than
a
but
he
had
denied
that
the
property
had
done
him
any
good
and
was
loud
in
declaring
that
the
entail
had
done
the
property
and
those
who
lived
on
it
very
much
harm
in
his
hearts
of
hearts
he
did
feel
a
desire
that
when
he
was
gone
the
acres
should
still
belong
to
a
caldigate
there
was
so
much
in
him
of
the
leaven
of
the
old
english
squirarchic
aristocracy
as
to
create
a
pride
in
the
fact
that
the
caldigates
had
been
at
folking
for
three
hundred
years
and
a
wish
that
they
might
remain
there
and
no
doubt
he
knew
that
without
repeated
entails
they
would
not
have
remained
there
but
still
he
had
hated
the
thing
and
as
years
rolled
on
he
came
to
think
that
the
entail
now
existing
would
do
an
especial
evil
his
son
on
leaving
school
spent
almost
the
whole
four
months
between
that
time
and
the
beginning
of
his
first
term
at
cambridge
with
the
babingtons
this
period
included
the
month
of
september
and
afforded
therefore
much
partridge
shooting
than
which
nothing
was
meaner
in
the
opinion
of
the
squire
of
folking
when
a
short
visit
was
made
to
folking
the
father
was
sarcastic
and
disagreeable
and
then
for
the
first
time
john
caldigate
showed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
a
power
of
reply
which
was
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
the
old
man
this
had
the
effect
of
cutting
down
the
intended
allowance
of
to
per
annum
for
which
sum
the
father
had
been
told
that
his
son
could
live
like
a
gentleman
at
the
university
this
parsimony
so
disgusted
uncle
babington
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
within
the
borders
of
suffolk
that
he
insisted
on
giving
his
nephew
a
hunter
and
an
undertaking
to
bear
the
expense
of
the
animal
as
long
as
john
should
remain
at
the
university
no
arrangement
could
have
been
more
foolish
and
that
last
visit
made
by
john
to
babington
house
for
the
two
days
previous
to
his
cambridge
career
was
in
itself
most
indiscreet
the
angry
father
would
not
take
upon
himself
to
forbid
it
but
was
worked
up
by
it
to
perilous
jealousy
he
did
not
scruple
to
declare
aloud
that
old
humphrey
babington
was
a
fool
nor
did
humphrey
babington
who
with
his
ten
or
twelve
thousand
was
considerably
involved
scruple
to
say
that
he
hated
such
ways
john
caldigate
felt
more
distaste
to
the
ways
than
he
did
to
his
want
of
literature
such
was
the
beginning
of
the
rupture
which
took
place
before
the
time
had
come
for
john
to
take
his
degree
when
that
time
came
he
had
a
couple
of
hunters
at
cambridge
played
in
the
cambridge
eleven
and
rowed
in
one
of
the
trinity
boats
he
also
owed
something
over
to
the
regular
tradesmen
of
the
university
and
a
good
deal
more
to
other
creditors
who
were
not
during
the
whole
of
this
time
his
visits
to
folking
had
been
short
and
few
the
old
squire
had
become
more
and
more
angry
and
not
the
less
so
because
he
was
sensible
of
a
of
duty
on
his
own
part
though
he
was
close
to
cambridge
he
never
went
to
see
his
son
nor
would
he
even
press
the
lad
to
come
out
to
folking
nor
when
on
rare
occasions
a
visit
was
made
did
he
endeavour
to
make
the
house
pleasant
he
was
jealous
jealous
to
hot
anger
at
being
neglected
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
make
advances
to
his
own
son
then
when
he
heard
from
his
son
tutor
that
his
son
could
not
pass
his
degree
without
the
payment
of
for
recognised
debts
then
his
anger
boiled
over
and
he
told
john
caldigate
that
he
was
expelled
from
his
father
heart
and
his
house
the
money
was
paid
and
the
degree
was
taken
and
there
arose
the
question
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
john
of
course
took
himself
to
babington
house
and
was
condoled
with
by
his
uncle
and
cousins
his
troubles
at
this
time
were
numerous
enough
that
by
no
means
summed
up
his
whole
indebtedness
covered
indeed
but
a
small
part
of
it
he
had
been
at
newmarket
and
there
was
a
pleasant
gentleman
named
davis
who
frequented
that
place
and
cambridge
who
had
been
very
civil
to
him
when
he
lost
a
little
money
and
who
now
held
his
acceptances
for
alas
much
more
than
even
uncle
babington
knew
nothing
of
this
when
the
degree
was
taken
and
then
there
came
a
terrible
blow
to
him
aunt
babington
aunt
polly
as
she
was
called
got
him
into
her
own
closet
upstairs
where
she
kept
her
linen
and
her
jams
and
favourite
liqueurs
and
told
him
that
his
cousin
julia
was
dying
in
love
for
him
after
all
that
had
passed
of
course
it
was
expected
he
would
engage
himself
to
his
cousin
julia
now
julia
was
the
eldest
the
and
the
of
the
lot
to
him
up
to
that
time
the
babington
folk
had
always
been
a
unit
no
one
else
had
been
so
to
him
had
so
petted
him
and
so
freely
administered
to
all
his
wants
he
would
kiss
them
all
round
whenever
he
went
to
babington
but
he
had
not
kissed
julia
more
than
her
sisters
there
were
three
sons
whom
he
never
specially
liked
and
who
certainly
were
fools
one
was
the
heir
and
of
course
did
nothing
the
second
was
struggling
for
a
degree
at
oxford
with
an
eye
to
the
family
living
the
third
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
the
family
gamekeeper
he
certainly
did
not
wish
to
marry
into
the
family
and
yet
they
had
all
been
so
kind
to
him
should
have
nothing
to
marry
on
aunt
polly
he
said
then
he
was
reminded
that
he
was
his
father
heir
and
that
his
father
house
was
sadly
in
want
of
a
mistress
they
could
live
at
babington
till
folking
should
be
ready
the
prospect
was
awful
what
is
a
young
man
to
say
in
such
a
position
do
not
love
the
young
lady
after
that
fashion
and
therefore
i
must
decline
it
requires
a
hero
and
a
hero
to
do
that
and
aunt
polly
was
very
much
in
earnest
for
she
brought
julia
into
the
room
and
absolutely
delivered
her
up
into
the
young
man
arms
am
so
much
in
debt
he
said
i
do
care
to
think
of
it
aunt
polly
declared
that
such
debts
did
not
signify
in
the
least
folking
was
not
embarrassed
folking
did
not
owe
a
shilling
every
one
knew
that
and
there
was
julia
in
his
arms
he
never
said
that
he
would
marry
her
but
when
he
left
the
the
two
ladies
understood
that
the
thing
was
arranged
luckily
for
him
aunt
polly
had
postponed
this
scene
till
the
moment
before
his
departure
from
the
house
he
was
at
this
time
going
to
cambridge
where
he
was
to
be
the
guest
for
one
night
of
a
certain
bolton
who
was
one
of
the
very
few
friends
to
whom
his
father
was
still
attached
bolton
was
a
banker
living
close
to
cambridge
an
old
man
now
with
four
sons
and
one
daughter
and
to
his
house
john
caldigate
was
going
in
order
that
he
might
there
discuss
with
bolton
certain
propositions
which
had
been
made
between
him
and
his
father
respecting
the
folking
property
the
father
had
now
realised
the
idea
of
buying
his
son
out
and
john
himself
who
had
all
the
world
and
all
his
life
before
him
and
was
terribly
conscious
of
the
obligations
which
he
owed
to
his
friend
davis
had
got
into
his
head
a
notion
that
he
would
prefer
to
face
his
fortune
with
a
sum
of
ready
money
than
to
wait
in
absolute
poverty
for
the
reversion
of
the
family
estate
he
had
his
own
ideas
and
in
furtherance
of
them
he
had
made
certain
inquiries
there
was
gold
being
found
at
this
moment
among
the
mountains
of
new
south
wales
in
quantities
which
captivated
his
imagination
and
this
was
being
done
in
a
most
lovely
spot
among
circumstances
which
were
in
all
respects
romantic
his
friend
richard
shand
who
was
also
a
trinity
man
was
quite
resolved
to
go
out
and
he
was
minded
to
accompany
his
friend
in
this
way
and
as
he
thought
in
this
way
only
could
a
final
settlement
be
made
with
that
most
assiduous
of
attendants
davis
his
mind
was
fully
set
upon
new
south
wales
and
his
little
interview
with
his
cousin
julia
did
not
tend
to
bind
him
more
closely
to
his
own
country
or
to
babington
or
to
folking
chapter
ii
puritan
grange
perhaps
there
had
been
a
little
treachery
on
the
part
of
davis
for
he
had
in
a
gently
insinuating
way
made
known
to
the
squire
the
fact
of
those
acceptances
and
the
additional
fact
that
he
was
through
unforeseen
circumstances
lamentably
in
want
of
ready
money
the
squire
became
eloquent
and
assured
davis
that
he
would
not
pay
a
penny
to
save
either
davis
or
his
son
from
instant
imprisonment
or
even
from
absolute
starvation
then
davis
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
whispered
the
word
the
squire
thereupon
threatened
to
kick
him
out
of
the
house
and
on
the
next
day
paid
a
visit
to
his
friend
bolton
there
had
after
that
been
a
long
correspondence
between
the
father
the
son
and
bolton
as
to
which
john
caldigate
said
not
a
word
to
the
babingtons
had
he
been
more
communicative
he
might
have
perhaps
saved
himself
from
that
scene
in
the
as
it
was
when
he
started
for
cambridge
nothing
was
known
at
babington
either
of
davis
or
of
the
new
south
wales
scheme
bolton
lived
in
a
large
house
in
the
village
of
chesterton
near
to
cambridge
which
with
a
large
garden
was
surrounded
by
an
old
high
he
rarely
saw
any
company
and
there
were
probably
not
many
of
the
more
recently
imported
inhabitants
of
the
town
who
had
ever
been
inside
the
elaborate
iron
gates
by
which
the
place
was
to
be
approached
he
had
been
a
banker
all
his
life
and
was
still
reported
to
be
the
senior
partner
in
bank
but
the
management
of
the
concern
had
in
truth
been
given
up
to
his
two
elder
sons
his
third
son
was
a
barrister
in
london
and
a
fourth
was
settled
in
cambridge
as
a
solicitor
these
men
were
all
married
and
were
doing
well
in
the
world
living
in
houses
better
than
their
father
and
spending
a
great
deal
more
money
bolton
had
the
name
of
being
a
hard
man
because
having
begun
life
in
small
circumstances
he
had
never
learned
to
chuck
his
shillings
about
easily
but
he
had
in
a
most
liberal
manner
made
over
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
his
sons
and
though
he
himself
could
rarely
be
got
to
sit
at
their
tables
he
took
delight
in
hearing
that
they
lived
bounteously
with
their
friends
he
had
been
twice
married
and
there
now
lived
with
him
his
second
wife
and
a
daughter
hester
a
girl
about
sixteen
years
of
age
at
the
period
of
john
caldigate
visit
to
puritan
grange
as
bolton
house
was
called
at
this
time
puritan
grange
was
not
badly
named
for
bolton
was
a
lady
of
stern
life
and
hester
bolton
was
brought
up
with
more
of
seclusion
and
religious
observances
than
are
now
common
in
our
houses
bolton
was
probably
ten
years
older
than
the
squire
of
folking
but
circumstances
had
in
early
life
made
them
fast
friends
the
old
squire
had
owed
a
large
sum
of
money
to
the
bank
and
bolton
had
then
been
attracted
by
the
manner
in
which
the
son
had
set
himself
to
work
so
that
he
might
not
be
a
burden
on
the
estate
they
had
been
fast
friends
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
now
the
arrangement
of
terms
between
the
present
squire
and
his
son
had
been
left
to
bolton
bolton
had
no
doubt
received
a
very
unfavourable
account
of
the
young
man
men
such
as
was
bolton
who
make
their
money
by
lending
it
out
at
recognised
rates
of
interest
and
who
are
generally
very
keen
in
looking
after
their
principal
have
no
mercy
whatsoever
for
the
davises
of
creation
and
very
little
for
their
customers
to
have
had
dealings
with
a
davis
is
condemnation
in
their
eyes
bolton
would
not
therefore
have
opened
his
gates
to
this
spendthrift
had
not
his
feelings
for
the
father
been
very
strong
he
had
thought
much
upon
the
matter
and
had
tried
hard
to
dissuade
the
squire
he
the
banker
was
not
particularly
attached
to
the
theory
of
primogeniture
he
had
divided
his
wealth
equally
between
his
own
sons
but
he
had
a
strong
idea
as
to
property
and
its
rights
the
young
man
claim
to
folking
after
his
father
death
was
as
valid
as
the
father
claim
during
his
life
no
doubt
the
severance
of
the
entail
if
made
at
all
would
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
young
man
wishes
and
on
certain
terms
which
should
be
declared
to
be
just
by
persons
able
to
compute
the
value
of
such
rights
no
doubt
also
so
bolton
thought
the
property
would
be
utterly
squandered
if
left
in
its
present
condition
it
would
be
ruined
by
incumbrances
in
the
shape
of
all
this
had
been
deeply
considered
and
at
last
bolton
had
consented
to
act
between
the
father
and
the
son
when
john
caldigate
was
driven
up
through
the
iron
gates
to
door
his
mind
was
not
quite
at
ease
within
him
he
had
seen
bolton
on
two
or
three
occasions
during
his
university
career
and
had
called
at
the
house
but
he
had
never
entered
it
and
had
never
seen
the
ladies
and
now
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
discuss
his
own
follies
and
own
all
his
faults
of
course
that
which
he
was
going
to
do
would
in
the
eyes
of
the
british
world
be
considered
very
unwise
the
british
world
regards
the
position
of
heirship
to
acres
as
the
most
desirable
which
a
young
man
could
hold
that
he
was
about
to
abandon
but
as
he
told
himself
without
abandoning
it
he
could
not
rid
himself
from
the
horror
of
davis
he
was
quite
prepared
to
acknowledge
his
own
vice
and
childish
stupidity
in
regard
to
davis
he
had
looked
all
round
that
now
and
was
sure
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
again
but
how
could
he
get
rid
of
davis
in
any
other
way
than
this
and
then
folking
had
no
charms
for
him
he
hated
folking
he
was
certain
that
any
life
would
suit
him
better
than
a
life
to
be
passed
as
squire
of
folking
and
he
was
quite
alive
to
the
fact
that
though
there
was
at
home
the
prospect
of
future
position
and
future
income
for
the
present
there
would
be
nothing
were
he
to
submit
himself
humbly
to
his
father
he
might
probably
be
allowed
to
vegetate
at
the
old
family
home
but
there
was
no
career
for
him
no
profession
had
as
yet
been
even
proposed
his
father
was
a
very
healthy
man
likely
to
live
for
the
next
twenty
years
and
then
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
dwell
in
peace
under
the
same
roof
with
his
father
and
davis
life
would
be
miserable
to
him
if
he
could
not
free
himself
from
that
thraldom
the
sum
of
money
which
was
to
be
offered
to
him
and
which
was
to
be
raised
on
the
folking
property
would
enable
him
to
pay
davis
and
to
start
upon
his
career
with
plentiful
means
in
his
pocket
he
would
too
be
wise
and
not
risk
all
his
capital
shand
had
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
and
he
would
start
with
a
like
sum
of
his
own
should
he
fail
in
new
south
wales
there
would
still
be
something
on
which
to
begin
again
with
his
mind
thus
fixed
he
entered
bolton
gates
he
was
to
stay
one
night
at
puritan
grange
and
then
if
the
matter
were
arranged
he
would
go
over
to
folking
for
a
day
or
two
and
endeavour
to
part
from
his
father
on
friendly
terms
in
that
case
he
would
be
able
to
pay
davis
himself
and
there
need
be
no
ground
for
quarrelling
on
that
score
before
dinner
the
matter
was
settled
at
the
grange
the
stern
old
man
bade
his
visitor
sit
down
and
then
explained
to
him
at
full
length
that
which
it
was
proposed
to
do
so
much
money
the
squire
had
himself
put
by
so
much
more
bolton
himself
would
advance
the
value
had
been
properly
computed
and
should
the
arrangement
be
completed
he
john
caldigate
would
sell
his
inheritance
at
its
proper
price
over
and
over
again
the
young
man
endeavoured
to
interrupt
the
speaker
but
was
told
to
postpone
his
words
till
the
other
should
have
done
such
interruptions
came
from
the
too
evident
fact
that
bolton
thoroughly
despised
his
guest
caldigate
though
he
had
been
very
foolish
though
he
had
loved
to
slaughter
rats
and
rabbits
and
to
romp
with
the
girls
at
babington
was
by
no
means
a
fool
he
was
possessed
of
good
natural
abilities
of
great
activity
and
of
a
high
spirit
his
appreciation
was
quicker
than
that
of
the
old
banker
who
as
he
soon
saw
had
altogether
failed
to
understand
him
in
every
word
that
the
banker
spoke
it
was
evident
that
he
thought
that
these
thousands
would
be
squandered
instantly
the
banker
spoke
as
though
this
terrible
severance
was
to
be
made
because
the
natural
heir
had
shown
himself
to
be
irrevocably
bad
what
could
be
expected
from
a
youth
who
was
deep
in
the
books
of
a
davis
before
he
had
left
his
college
do
not
recommend
this
he
said
at
last
have
never
recommended
it
the
disruption
is
so
great
as
to
be
awful
but
when
your
father
has
asked
what
better
step
he
could
take
i
have
been
unable
to
advise
him
it
was
as
though
the
old
man
were
telling
the
young
one
that
he
was
too
bad
for
hope
and
that
therefore
he
must
be
consigned
for
ever
to
perdition
caldigate
conscious
of
the
mistake
which
the
banker
was
making
full
of
hope
as
to
himself
intending
to
acknowledge
the
follies
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
promise
for
he
would
not
condescend
so
far
but
to
profess
that
they
were
things
of
the
past
and
impatient
of
the
judgment
expressed
against
him
endeavoured
to
stop
the
old
man
in
his
severity
so
that
the
tone
in
which
the
business
was
being
done
might
be
altered
but
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
do
this
without
offence
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
heard
the
indictment
to
the
end
bolton
he
said
when
at
length
his
time
came
shall
hear
my
view
of
the
matter
and
bolton
did
hear
him
listening
very
patiently
caldigate
first
asserted
that
in
coming
there
to
puritan
grange
his
object
had
been
to
learn
what
were
the
terms
proposed
as
to
which
he
was
now
willing
to
give
his
assent
he
had
already
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
sell
what
property
he
had
on
the
estate
and
therefore
though
he
was
much
indebted
to
bolton
for
his
disinterested
and
kind
friendship
he
was
hardly
in
want
of
counsel
on
that
matter
bolton
raised
his
eyebrows
but
still
listened
patiently
caldigate
then
went
on
to
explain
his
views
as
to
life
declaring
that
under
no
circumstances
had
there
been
no
davis
would
he
have
consented
to
remain
at
folking
as
a
waiting
to
take
up
his
position
some
twenty
years
hence
at
his
father
death
nor
even
were
folking
his
own
at
this
moment
would
he
live
there
he
must
do
something
and
upon
the
whole
he
thought
that
in
the
colonies
was
the
most
congenial
pursuit
to
which
he
could
put
his
hand
then
he
made
a
frank
acknowledgment
as
to
davis
and
his
gambling
follies
and
ended
by
saying
that
the
matter
might
be
regarded
as
settled
he
had
certainly
been
successful
in
changing
the
old
man
opinion
bolton
did
not
say
as
much
nor
was
he
a
man
likely
to
make
such
acknowledgment
but
when
he
led
john
caldigate
away
to
be
introduced
to
his
wife
in
the
he
felt
less
of
disdain
for
his
guest
than
he
had
done
half
an
hour
before
bolton
was
a
silent
cautious
man
even
in
his
own
family
and
had
said
nothing
of
this
business
to
his
wife
and
nothing
of
course
to
his
daughter
bolton
asked
after
the
squire
and
expressed
a
hope
that
her
guest
would
not
find
the
house
very
dull
for
one
night
she
had
heard
that
john
caldigate
was
a
fast
young
man
and
of
course
regarded
him
as
a
lost
sinner
hester
who
was
with
her
mother
looked
at
him
with
all
her
young
big
eyes
but
did
not
speak
a
word
it
was
very
seldom
that
she
saw
any
young
man
or
indeed
young
people
of
either
sex
but
when
this
stranger
spoke
freely
to
her
mother
about
this
subject
and
the
other
she
listened
to
him
and
was
interested
john
caldigate
without
being
absolutely
handsome
was
a
youth
sure
to
find
favour
in
a
woman
eyes
he
was
about
five
feet
ten
in
height
strong
and
very
active
with
bright
dark
eyes
which
were
full
of
life
and
intelligence
his
forehead
was
square
and
showed
the
angles
of
his
brow
his
hair
was
dark
and
thick
and
cut
somewhat
short
his
mouth
was
large
but
full
of
expression
and
generally
also
of
his
nose
would
have
been
well
formed
but
that
it
was
a
little
snubbed
at
the
end
altogether
his
face
gave
you
the
idea
of
will
intellect
and
a
kindly
nature
but
there
was
in
it
a
promise
too
of
occasional
anger
and
a
physiognomist
might
perhaps
have
expected
from
it
that
vacillation
in
conduct
which
had
hitherto
led
him
from
better
things
into
wretched
faults
as
he
was
talking
to
bolton
he
had
observed
the
girl
who
sat
apart
with
her
fingers
busy
on
her
work
and
who
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
since
his
entrance
she
was
he
thought
the
most
lovely
human
being
that
he
had
ever
beheld
and
yet
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
child
but
how
different
from
those
girls
at
babington
her
bright
brown
hair
was
simply
brushed
from
off
her
forehead
and
tied
in
a
knot
behind
her
head
her
dress
was
as
plain
as
a
child
as
though
it
was
intended
that
she
should
still
be
regarded
as
a
child
her
face
was
very
fair
with
large
grey
thoughtful
eyes
and
a
mouth
which
though
as
caldigate
watched
her
it
was
never
opened
seemed
always
as
if
it
was
just
about
to
pour
forth
words
and
he
could
see
that
though
her
eyes
were
intent
upon
her
work
from
time
to
time
she
looked
across
at
him
and
he
thought
that
if
only
they
two
were
alone
together
he
could
teach
her
to
speak
but
no
such
opportunity
was
given
to
him
now
or
during
his
short
sojourn
at
the
grange
after
a
while
the
old
man
returned
to
the
room
and
took
him
up
to
his
it
was
then
about
four
and
he
was
told
that
they
were
to
dine
at
six
it
was
early
in
november
not
cold
enough
for
bedroom
fires
among
thrifty
people
and
there
he
was
left
apparently
to
spend
an
hour
with
nothing
to
do
rebelling
against
this
declaring
that
even
at
puritan
grange
he
would
be
master
of
his
own
actions
he
rushed
down
into
the
hall
took
his
hat
and
walked
off
into
the
town
he
would
go
and
take
one
last
look
at
the
old
college
he
went
in
through
the
great
gate
and
across
the
yard
and
passing
by
the
looked
into
the
old
hall
for
the
last
time
the
men
were
all
seated
at
dinner
and
he
could
see
the
fellows
up
at
the
high
table
three
years
ago
it
had
been
his
fixed
resolve
to
earn
for
himself
the
right
to
sit
upon
that
dais
he
had
then
been
sure
of
himself
that
he
would
do
well
and
take
honours
and
win
a
fellowship
there
had
been
moments
in
which
he
had
thought
that
a
college
life
would
suit
him
till
he
came
into
his
own
property
but
how
had
all
that
faded
away
everybody
had
congratulated
him
on
the
ease
with
which
he
did
his
work
and
the
result
had
been
newmarket
davis
and
a
long
score
in
the
ephemeral
records
of
a
cricket
match
as
he
stood
there
with
his
slouched
hat
over
his
eyes
one
of
the
college
servants
recognised
him
and
called
him
by
his
name
then
he
passed
on
quickly
and
made
his
way
out
to
the
by
the
it
was
not
yet
closed
for
the
night
and
he
went
on
that
he
might
take
one
last
turn
up
and
down
the
old
avenue
he
had
certainly
made
a
failure
of
his
life
so
far
he
did
acknowledge
to
himself
that
there
was
something
nobler
in
these
classic
shades
than
in
the
dirt
of
an
australian
he
knew
as
much
of
the
world
as
that
he
had
not
hitherto
chosen
the
better
part
and
now
something
of
regret
even
as
to
folking
poor
old
folking
came
upon
him
he
was
as
it
were
being
kicked
out
and
repudiated
by
his
own
family
as
worthless
and
what
was
he
to
do
about
julia
babington
after
that
scene
in
the
he
could
not
leave
his
country
without
a
word
either
to
julia
or
to
aunt
polly
but
the
idea
of
julia
was
doubly
distasteful
to
him
since
that
lovely
vision
of
young
female
simplicity
had
shone
upon
him
from
the
corner
of
bolton
romping
with
the
babington
girls
was
all
very
well
but
if
he
could
only
feel
the
tips
of
that
girl
fingers
come
within
the
grasp
of
his
hand
then
he
thought
that
it
would
lend
a
fine
romance
to
his
life
if
he
could
resolve
to
come
back
when
he
should
be
laden
with
gold
and
make
hester
bolton
his
wife
it
should
be
his
romance
and
he
swore
that
he
would
cling
to
it
he
turned
back
and
came
down
to
dinner
five
minutes
after
the
time
at
ten
minutes
before
bolton
heard
that
he
was
gone
out
and
was
offended
thinking
it
quite
possible
that
he
would
not
return
at
all
what
might
not
be
expected
from
a
young
man
who
could
so
easily
abandon
his
inheritance
but
he
was
there
only
five
minutes
after
the
time
and
the
dinner
was
eaten
almost
in
silence
in
the
evening
there
was
tea
and
the
coldest
shivering
attempt
at
conversation
for
half
an
hour
during
which
he
could
still
at
moments
catch
the
glance
of
hester
eyes
and
see
the
moving
curve
of
her
lips
then
there
was
a
reading
of
the
bible
and
prayer
and
before
ten
he
was
in
his
on
the
next
morning
as
he
took
his
departure
bolton
said
a
word
intended
to
be
gracious
hope
you
may
succeed
in
your
enterprise
mr
caldigate
should
i
not
as
well
as
another
said
john
cheerily
you
are
steady
sober
industrious
and
honest
you
probably
will
replied
the
banker
promise
all
that
would
be
to
promise
too
much
said
john
i
mean
to
make
an
effort
then
at
that
moment
he
made
one
effort
which
was
successful
for
an
instant
he
held
hester
fingers
within
his
hand
chapter
iii
daniel
caldigate
that
piece
of
business
was
done
it
was
one
of
the
disagreeable
things
which
he
had
had
to
do
before
he
could
get
away
to
the
and
it
was
done
now
he
had
to
say
farewell
to
his
father
and
that
would
be
a
harder
task
as
the
moment
was
coming
in
which
he
must
bid
adieu
to
his
father
perhaps
for
ever
and
bid
adieu
to
the
old
place
which
though
he
despised
it
he
still
loved
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
he
felt
sure
that
his
father
had
no
special
regard
for
him
in
which
he
was
of
course
altogether
wrong
and
the
old
man
was
equally
wrong
in
supposing
that
his
son
was
unnaturally
deficient
in
filial
affection
but
they
had
never
known
each
other
and
were
so
different
that
neither
had
understood
the
other
the
son
however
was
ready
to
confess
to
himself
that
the
chief
fault
had
been
with
himself
it
was
natural
he
thought
that
a
father
regard
should
be
deadened
by
such
conduct
as
his
had
been
and
natural
that
an
old
man
should
not
believe
in
the
quick
repentance
and
improvement
of
a
young
one
he
hired
a
gig
and
drove
himself
over
from
cambridge
to
folking
as
he
got
near
to
the
place
and
passed
along
the
dikes
and
looked
to
the
right
and
left
down
the
droves
and
trotted
at
last
over
the
folking
bridge
across
the
middle
wash
the
country
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
so
unattractive
as
of
yore
and
when
he
recognised
the
faces
of
the
neighbours
when
one
of
the
tenants
spoke
to
him
kindly
and
the
girls
dropped
a
curtsey
as
he
passed
certain
soft
regrets
began
to
crop
up
in
his
mind
after
all
there
is
a
comfort
in
the
feeling
of
property
not
simply
its
money
comfort
but
in
the
stability
and
reputation
of
a
recognised
home
six
months
ago
there
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
something
ridiculous
in
the
idea
of
a
permanent
connection
between
the
names
of
caldigate
and
folking
it
was
absurd
that
with
so
wild
and
beautiful
a
world
around
him
he
should
be
called
upon
to
live
in
a
washy
fen
because
his
father
and
grandfather
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
do
so
and
then
at
that
time
all
sympathy
with
bricks
and
mortar
any
affection
for
special
trees
or
was
absurd
in
his
eyes
and
as
his
father
had
been
harsh
to
him
and
did
not
like
him
would
it
not
be
better
that
they
should
be
far
apart
it
was
thus
that
he
had
reasoned
but
now
all
that
was
changed
an
unwonted
tenderness
had
come
upon
his
spirit
the
very
sallows
by
the
brook
seemed
to
appeal
to
him
as
he
saw
the
house
chimneys
through
the
trees
he
remembered
that
they
had
carried
smoke
from
the
hearths
of
many
generations
of
caldigates
he
remembered
too
that
his
father
would
soon
be
old
and
would
be
alone
it
seemed
to
himself
that
his
very
mind
and
spirit
were
altered
but
all
that
was
too
late
he
had
agreed
to
the
terms
proposed
and
even
were
he
now
to
repudiate
them
what
could
he
do
with
davis
and
how
could
he
live
for
the
present
not
for
a
moment
did
he
entertain
such
an
idea
but
he
had
lost
that
alacrity
of
spirit
which
had
been
his
when
he
first
found
the
way
out
of
his
difficulties
his
father
did
not
come
forth
to
meet
him
he
went
in
across
the
hall
and
through
the
library
into
a
little
closet
beyond
in
which
caldigate
was
wont
to
sit
john
said
the
old
man
have
you
and
bolton
got
on
together
there
seemed
to
be
something
terribly
cold
in
this
it
might
be
better
that
they
should
part
better
even
though
the
parting
should
be
for
ever
it
might
be
right
nay
he
knew
that
it
was
right
that
he
should
be
thrust
out
of
the
inheritance
he
had
spent
money
that
was
not
his
own
and
of
course
he
must
pay
the
debt
but
that
his
father
should
sit
there
in
his
chair
on
his
entrance
not
even
rising
to
greet
him
and
should
refer
at
once
to
bolton
and
that
business
arrangement
as
though
that
and
that
alone
need
now
be
discussed
did
seem
to
him
to
be
almost
cruel
of
all
that
his
father
had
suffered
in
constraining
himself
to
this
conduct
he
understood
nothing
bolton
made
himself
very
plain
sir
would
be
sure
to
do
so
he
is
a
man
of
business
and
intelligent
but
as
to
the
terms
proposed
were
they
what
you
had
expected
as
good
as
i
had
expected
good
or
bad
of
course
you
will
understand
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
the
matter
has
been
referred
to
two
gentlemen
conversant
with
such
subjects
and
after
due
inquiry
they
told
bolton
what
was
the
money
value
of
your
rights
it
is
a
question
to
be
settled
as
easily
as
the
price
of
a
ton
of
coals
or
a
joint
of
beef
but
you
must
understand
that
i
have
not
interfered
am
quite
aware
of
that
sir
for
the
money
something
over
a
third
of
it
is
in
my
own
hands
i
have
not
been
extravagant
myself
and
have
saved
so
much
the
remainder
will
come
out
of
bolton
bank
and
will
be
lent
on
mortgage
i
certainly
shall
not
have
cause
for
extravagance
now
living
here
alone
and
shall
endeavour
to
free
the
estate
from
the
burden
by
degrees
when
i
die
it
will
in
accordance
with
my
present
purpose
go
to
your
cousin
george
as
this
was
said
john
thought
he
perceived
something
like
a
quiver
in
his
father
voice
which
up
to
that
point
had
been
hard
clear
and
unshaken
to
that
however
i
do
not
intend
to
pledge
myself
he
continued
estate
will
now
be
my
own
subject
to
the
claim
from
bolton
bank
i
do
know
that
there
is
anything
else
to
be
said
about
business
sir
it
is
business
i
suppose
that
has
brought
you
here
and
to
cambridge
i
do
not
know
what
little
things
you
have
of
your
own
in
the
house
much
sir
there
be
anything
that
you
wish
to
take
take
it
but
with
you
now
i
suppose
money
is
the
only
possession
that
has
any
value
should
like
to
have
the
small
portrait
of
you
the
miniature
miniature
of
me
said
the
father
almost
scoffingly
looking
up
at
his
son
face
suspiciously
and
yet
though
he
would
not
show
it
he
was
touched
only
if
this
were
a
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
a
mock
sentiment
a
little
theatrical
pretence
then
then
how
disgraced
he
would
be
in
his
own
estimation
at
having
been
moved
by
such
mockery
the
son
stood
square
before
his
father
disdaining
any
attempt
to
evince
a
supplicating
tenderness
either
by
his
voice
or
by
his
features
perhaps
you
have
a
special
value
for
it
he
said
indeed
it
is
others
not
oneself
that
ought
to
have
such
trifles
that
is
if
they
are
of
value
at
all
is
none
but
myself
that
can
care
much
for
it
is
no
one
to
care
at
all
no
one
else
that
is
he
added
wishing
to
avoid
any
further
declaration
that
or
anything
else
you
want
in
the
house
there
will
be
things
left
i
suppose
clothes
and
books
and
suchlike
anything
sir
going
so
far
i
had
better
give
them
away
a
few
books
i
shall
take
then
the
conversation
was
over
and
in
a
few
minutes
john
caldigate
found
himself
roaming
alone
about
the
place
it
was
so
probable
that
he
might
never
see
it
again
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
were
he
to
return
to
england
with
a
fortune
made
he
would
hardly
come
to
folking
years
and
years
must
roll
by
before
that
could
be
done
if
he
could
only
come
back
to
cambridge
and
fetch
that
wife
away
with
him
then
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
live
far
from
england
whether
he
were
rich
or
whether
he
were
poor
it
was
quite
evident
that
his
father
heart
was
turned
from
him
altogether
of
course
he
had
himself
to
blame
himself
only
but
still
it
was
strange
to
him
that
a
father
should
feel
no
tenderness
at
parting
with
an
only
son
while
he
had
been
in
the
room
he
had
constrained
himself
manfully
not
a
drop
of
moisture
had
glittered
in
his
eye
not
a
tone
of
feeling
had
thrilled
in
his
voice
his
features
had
never
failed
him
there
had
always
been
that
look
of
audacity
on
his
brow
joined
to
a
certain
manliness
of
in
his
mouth
as
though
he
had
been
thoroughly
master
of
himself
and
the
situation
but
now
as
he
pushed
his
hat
from
off
his
forehead
he
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
to
dash
away
the
tears
he
felt
almost
inclined
to
rush
back
to
the
house
and
fall
on
his
knees
before
his
father
and
kiss
the
old
man
hands
and
beg
the
old
man
blessing
but
though
he
was
potent
for
much
he
was
not
potent
for
that
such
expression
of
tenderness
would
have
been
true
but
he
knew
that
he
would
so
break
down
in
the
attempt
as
to
make
it
seem
to
be
false
he
got
out
upon
twopenny
drove
and
passed
over
the
ferry
meaning
to
walk
across
the
farm
and
so
out
on
to
the
causeway
and
round
home
by
the
bridge
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
wash
he
encountered
ralph
holt
the
occupier
of
twopenny
farm
whose
father
also
and
grandfather
had
lived
upon
the
same
acres
so
thou
going
away
from
us
john
said
the
farmer
with
real
tenderness
almost
with
solemnity
in
his
voice
although
there
was
at
the
same
time
something
ridiculous
in
the
sadness
of
his
tone
and
gait
indeed
holt
i
want
to
travel
and
see
the
world
at
a
distance
from
here
it
was
no
more
than
that
john
there
would
be
nothing
about
it
zeeing
the
world
you
young
collegers
allays
does
that
but
thou
to
come
back
and
be
squoire
think
not
holt
i
think
not
my
father
i
hope
will
be
squire
for
many
a
year
enough
and
we
all
hope
that
for
there
are
nowhere
a
juster
man
nor
the
squoire
and
he
hale
and
hearty
but
in
course
of
things
his
time
run
out
and
it
be
so
john
that
thou
going
for
ever
and
allays
rather
think
i
am
wrong
john
though
maybe
i
making
to
talk
of
what
do
concern
me
yet
i
say
it
wrong
sons
should
come
arter
fathers
specially
where
there
land
we
do
none
of
us
like
it
none
of
us
it
worse
nor
going
any
one
of
ourselves
for
what
a
lease
but
when
a
man
has
a
freehold
he
should
stick
to
it
for
ever
and
aye
it
just
as
though
the
old
place
was
about
all
our
ears
caldigate
was
with
the
man
trying
to
make
him
understand
that
everything
was
being
done
for
the
best
and
at
last
he
bade
him
affectionately
shaking
hands
with
him
and
going
into
the
farmhouse
to
perform
the
same
ceremony
with
his
wife
and
daughters
but
to
the
last
ralph
holt
was
uncomfortable
and
dismal
foretelling
miseries
it
was
clear
that
to
his
thinking
the
stability
of
this
world
was
undermined
and
destroyed
by
the
very
contemplation
of
such
a
proceeding
as
this
caldigate
pursued
his
walk
and
in
the
course
of
it
bade
farewell
to
more
than
one
old
friend
none
of
them
were
so
expressive
as
holt
but
he
could
perceive
that
he
was
regarded
by
all
of
them
as
a
person
who
by
his
conduct
was
bringing
misfortune
not
only
on
himself
but
on
the
whole
parishes
of
utterden
and
netherden
at
dinner
the
squire
conversed
upon
various
subjects
if
not
easily
to
himself
at
least
with
affected
ease
had
he
applied
himself
to
subjects
altogether
indifferent
to
the
state
of
politics
or
the
game
laws
or
the
absurdities
of
a
state
church
the
unfitness
of
such
matters
for
the
occasion
would
have
been
too
apparent
both
he
and
his
son
would
have
broken
down
in
the
attempt
but
he
could
talk
about
babington
abusing
the
old
family
and
even
about
himself
and
about
new
south
wales
and
gold
and
the
coming
voyage
without
touching
points
which
had
been
and
would
be
specially
painful
not
a
word
had
ever
been
spoken
between
them
as
to
davis
there
had
of
course
been
letters
very
angry
letters
but
the
usurer
name
had
never
been
mentioned
nor
was
there
any
need
that
it
should
be
mentioned
now
it
was
john
affair
not
in
any
way
his
so
he
asked
and
listened
to
much
about
richard
shand
and
the
mode
of
practised
among
the
diggings
in
new
south
wales
when
the
old
butler
had
gone
he
was
even
more
free
speaking
of
things
that
were
past
not
only
without
anger
but
as
far
as
possible
without
chagrin
treating
his
son
as
a
person
altogether
free
from
any
control
of
his
dare
say
it
is
all
for
the
best
he
said
is
well
at
any
rate
to
try
to
think
so
sir
replied
john
as
to
his
own
faults
doubt
whether
there
would
have
been
anything
for
you
to
do
here
or
at
least
anything
that
you
would
have
done
you
would
have
had
too
much
ambition
to
manage
this
little
estate
under
me
and
not
enough
of
industry
i
fear
to
carry
you
to
the
front
in
any
of
the
professions
i
used
to
think
of
the
bar
so
did
i
when
i
found
that
the
babingtons
had
got
hold
of
you
and
that
you
liked
horses
and
guns
better
than
words
and
arguments
never
did
sir
seemed
so
course
i
have
been
weak
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
am
finding
fault
it
would
be
of
no
avail
and
i
would
not
thus
embitter
our
last
hours
together
but
when
i
saw
how
your
tastes
seemed
to
lead
you
i
began
to
fear
that
there
could
be
no
career
for
you
here
on
such
a
property
as
babington
an
eldest
son
may
vegetate
like
his
father
before
him
and
may
succeed
to
it
in
due
time
before
he
has
wasted
everything
and
may
die
as
he
had
lived
useless
but
having
to
the
end
all
the
enjoyments
of
a
swine
are
severe
upon
my
cousins
sir
say
what
i
think
but
you
would
not
have
done
that
and
though
you
are
not
industrious
you
are
far
too
active
and
too
clever
for
such
a
life
now
you
are
probably
in
earnest
as
to
the
future
i
am
certainly
in
earnest
though
you
are
going
to
risk
your
capital
in
a
precarious
business
you
will
only
be
doing
what
is
done
daily
by
enterprising
men
i
could
wish
that
your
position
were
more
secure
but
that
now
can
not
be
helped
bed
is
as
i
have
made
it
i
quite
understand
that
sir
of
all
this
i
have
endeavoured
to
reconcile
myself
to
your
going
then
he
paused
a
moment
considering
what
he
should
next
say
and
his
son
was
silent
knowing
that
something
further
was
to
come
you
remained
in
england
we
could
hardly
have
lived
together
as
father
and
son
should
live
you
would
have
been
dependent
on
me
and
would
have
rebelled
against
that
submission
which
a
state
of
dependence
demands
there
would
have
been
nothing
for
you
but
to
have
waited
and
almost
to
have
wished
for
my
death
sir
never
never
that
would
have
been
no
more
than
natural
i
shall
hear
from
you
sometimes
sir
will
give
an
interest
to
my
life
if
you
will
write
occasionally
whither
do
you
go
it
had
certainly
been
presumed
though
never
said
that
this
last
visit
to
the
old
home
was
to
be
only
for
one
day
the
hired
gig
had
been
kept
and
in
his
letter
the
son
had
asked
whether
he
could
be
taken
in
for
thursday
night
but
now
the
proposition
that
he
should
go
so
soon
seemed
to
imply
a
want
of
feeling
on
his
part
need
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
sir
he
said
course
it
shall
be
as
you
please
but
i
do
not
know
that
you
will
do
any
good
by
staying
a
last
month
may
be
pleasant
enough
or
even
a
last
week
but
a
last
day
is
purgatory
the
melancholy
of
the
occasion
can
not
be
shaken
off
it
is
only
the
prolonged
wail
of
a
last
farewell
all
this
was
said
in
the
old
man
ordinary
voice
but
it
seemed
to
betoken
if
not
feeling
itself
a
recognition
of
feeling
which
the
son
had
not
expected
is
very
sad
said
the
son
why
prolong
it
stand
not
upon
the
order
of
your
going
but
go
at
once
seeing
that
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
go
will
you
take
any
more
wine
no
then
let
us
go
into
the
other
room
as
they
are
making
company
of
you
and
have
lighted
another
fire
we
will
do
as
they
would
have
us
then
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
there
was
some
talk
about
books
and
the
father
who
was
greatly
given
to
reading
explained
to
his
son
what
kind
of
literature
would
as
he
thought
fit
in
best
with
the
life
of
a
after
what
had
passed
caldigate
of
course
took
his
departure
on
the
following
morning
said
the
old
man
as
the
son
grasped
his
hand
he
made
no
overture
to
come
even
as
far
as
the
hall
in
making
this
his
final
adieu
trust
i
may
return
to
see
you
in
health
may
be
so
as
to
that
we
can
say
nothing
then
when
the
son
had
turned
his
back
the
father
recalled
him
by
a
murmur
rather
than
by
a
word
but
in
that
moment
he
had
resolved
to
give
way
a
little
to
the
demands
of
nature
my
son
he
said
in
a
low
voice
very
solemnly
god
bless
you
and
preserve
you
then
he
turned
back
at
once
to
his
own
closet
chapter
iv
the
shands
john
caldigate
had
promised
to
go
direct
from
folking
to
the
house
of
his
friend
richard
shand
or
rather
to
the
house
in
which
lived
richard
shand
father
and
family
the
two
young
men
had
much
to
arrange
together
and
this
had
been
thought
to
be
expedient
when
caldigate
remembering
how
affairs
were
at
his
own
home
had
suggested
that
at
so
sad
a
moment
he
might
be
found
to
be
in
the
way
shand
had
assured
him
that
there
would
be
no
sadness
at
all
are
not
a
sentimental
race
he
had
said
are
a
dozen
of
us
and
the
sooner
some
of
us
disperse
ourselves
the
more
room
will
there
be
in
the
nest
for
the
others
shand
had
been
caldigate
most
intimate
friend
at
college
through
the
whole
period
of
their
residence
and
now
he
was
to
be
his
companion
in
a
still
more
intimate
alliance
and
yet
though
he
liked
the
man
he
did
not
altogether
approve
of
him
shand
had
also
got
into
debt
at
cambridge
but
had
not
paid
his
debts
and
had
dealings
also
with
davis
as
to
which
he
was
now
quite
indifferent
he
had
left
the
university
without
taking
a
degree
and
had
seemed
to
bear
all
these
adversities
with
perfect
equanimity
there
had
not
been
hitherto
much
of
veneration
in
caldigate
character
but
even
he
had
on
occasions
been
almost
shocked
at
the
want
of
respect
evinced
by
his
friend
for
conventional
rules
all
college
discipline
all
college
authorities
all
university
traditions
had
been
despised
by
shand
who
even
in
his
dress
had
departed
as
far
from
recognised
customs
and
fashions
among
the
men
as
from
the
requisitions
of
the
statutes
and
the
milder
requirements
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
day
now
though
he
could
not
pay
his
debts
and
intended
indeed
to
run
away
from
them
he
was
going
to
try
his
fortune
with
a
certain
small
capital
which
his
father
had
agreed
to
give
him
as
his
share
of
what
there
might
be
of
the
good
things
of
the
world
among
the
shands
generally
as
shand
himself
said
of
both
of
them
he
was
about
to
go
forth
as
a
prodigal
son
with
a
perfect
assurance
that
should
he
come
back
no
calf
would
be
killed
for
him
but
he
was
an
active
man
with
a
dash
of
fun
and
perhaps
a
sprinkling
of
wit
quick
and
brave
to
whom
life
was
apparently
a
joke
and
who
boasted
of
himself
that
though
he
was
very
fond
of
beef
and
beer
he
could
live
on
bread
and
water
if
put
to
it
without
complaining
caldigate
almost
feared
that
the
man
was
a
dangerous
companion
but
still
there
was
a
certain
fitness
about
him
for
the
thing
contemplated
and
for
such
a
venture
where
could
he
find
any
other
companion
who
would
be
fit
shand
the
father
was
a
physician
enjoying
a
considerable
amount
of
provincial
eminence
in
a
small
town
in
essex
here
he
had
certainly
been
a
succesful
man
for
with
all
the
weight
of
such
a
family
on
his
back
he
had
managed
to
save
some
money
there
had
been
small
legacies
from
other
shands
and
trifles
of
portion
had
come
to
them
from
the
potters
of
whom
shand
had
been
one
shand
and
potter
having
been
wholesale
druggists
in
smithfield
the
young
shands
had
generally
lived
a
pleasant
life
had
gone
to
school
the
eldest
son
as
we
have
seen
to
the
university
also
and
had
had
governesses
and
ponies
to
ride
and
had
been
great
at
dancing
and
had
shot
arrows
and
played
badminton
and
been
subject
to
but
little
domestic
discipline
they
had
lived
crowded
together
in
a
great
house
plenteously
roughly
quarrelling
continually
but
very
fond
of
each
other
in
their
own
way
and
were
known
throughout
that
side
of
the
country
as
a
happy
family
the
girls
had
always
gloves
and
shoes
for
dancing
and
the
boys
had
enjoyed
a
considerable
amount
of
shooting
and
hunting
without
owning
either
guns
or
horses
of
their
own
now
dick
was
to
go
in
quest
of
a
fortune
and
all
the
girls
were
stitching
shirts
for
him
and
were
as
happy
as
possible
not
a
word
was
said
about
his
debts
and
no
one
threw
it
in
his
teeth
that
he
had
failed
to
take
a
degree
it
was
known
of
the
shands
that
they
always
made
the
best
of
everything
when
caldigate
got
out
of
the
railway
carriage
at
pollington
he
was
still
melancholy
with
the
remembrance
of
all
that
he
had
done
and
all
that
he
had
lost
and
he
expected
to
find
something
of
the
same
feeling
at
his
friend
house
but
before
he
had
been
there
an
hour
he
was
laughing
with
the
girls
as
though
such
an
enterprise
as
theirs
was
the
best
joke
in
the
world
and
when
a
day
and
a
night
had
passed
shand
was
deep
among
his
shirts
and
socks
and
had
already
given
him
much
advice
about
flannel
and
soft
soap
know
maria
would
like
to
go
out
with
you
said
the
youngest
daughter
on
the
third
day
a
girl
of
twelve
years
old
who
ought
to
have
known
better
and
who
nevertheless
knew
more
than
she
ought
to
have
done
maria
would
like
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
young
lady
in
question
caldigate
of
course
you
would
have
to
marry
her
then
the
child
was
cuffed
and
maria
declared
that
the
proposed
arrangement
would
suit
neither
her
nor
caldigate
in
the
least
the
eldest
daughter
harriet
was
engaged
to
marry
a
young
clergyman
in
the
neighbourhood
which
event
however
was
to
be
postponed
till
he
had
got
a
living
and
the
second
matilda
was
under
a
cloud
because
she
would
persist
in
being
in
love
with
lieutenant
postlethwaite
of
the
dragoons
whose
regiment
was
quartered
in
the
town
maria
was
the
third
all
these
family
secrets
were
told
to
him
quite
openly
as
well
as
the
fact
that
josh
the
third
son
was
to
become
a
farmer
because
he
could
not
be
got
to
learn
the
multiplication
table
between
pollington
and
london
caldigate
remained
for
six
weeks
during
which
time
he
fitted
himself
out
took
his
passage
and
executed
the
necessary
deeds
as
to
the
estate
it
might
have
been
pleasant
enough
this
little
interval
before
his
voyage
as
the
shands
though
rough
and
coarse
were
kind
to
him
and
had
it
not
been
that
a
great
trouble
befell
him
through
over
conscientiousness
as
to
a
certain
matter
after
what
had
passed
at
babington
house
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
before
he
started
for
new
south
wales
give
some
notice
to
his
relatives
there
so
that
julia
might
know
that
destiny
did
not
intend
her
to
become
caldigate
of
folking
aunt
polly
had
no
doubt
been
too
forward
in
that
matter
and
in
wishing
to
dispose
of
her
daughter
had
put
herself
in
the
way
of
merited
rebuke
and
disappointment
it
was
however
not
the
less
necessary
that
she
should
be
told
of
the
altered
circumstances
of
her
but
had
he
been
wise
he
would
so
have
written
his
letter
that
no
answer
should
reach
him
before
he
had
left
the
shores
of
england
his
conscience
however
pinched
him
and
before
he
had
even
settled
the
day
on
which
he
would
start
he
wrote
to
his
aunt
a
long
letter
in
which
he
told
her
everything
how
he
had
disposed
of
his
inheritance
how
he
had
become
so
indebted
to
davis
as
to
have
to
seek
a
new
fortune
out
of
england
how
he
had
bade
farewell
to
folking
for
ever
and
how
impossible
it
was
under
all
these
circumstances
that
he
should
aspire
to
the
hand
of
his
cousin
julia
it
was
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
among
them
at
babington
babington
himself
was
certainly
not
a
clever
man
but
he
knew
enough
of
his
own
position
as
an
owner
of
acres
to
be
very
proud
of
it
and
he
was
affectionate
enough
towards
his
nephew
to
feel
the
full
weight
of
this
terrible
disruption
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
daniel
caldigate
was
doing
a
very
wicked
thing
and
he
hurried
across
the
country
to
folking
that
he
might
say
so
have
not
sense
enough
to
understand
the
matter
said
daniel
caldigate
have
no
heart
in
your
bowels
if
you
can
disinherit
an
only
son
said
the
big
squire
mind
where
i
carry
my
heart
said
the
smaller
squire
it
is
a
pity
you
should
carry
so
small
an
amount
of
brain
no
good
could
be
done
by
such
a
meeting
as
that
nor
by
the
journey
which
aunt
polly
took
to
pollington
the
caldigates
both
father
and
son
were
gifted
with
too
strong
a
will
to
be
turned
from
their
purpose
by
such
interference
but
a
great
deal
of
confusion
was
occasioned
and
aunt
polly
among
the
shands
was
regarded
as
a
very
wonderful
woman
indeed
my
son
my
darling
son
she
said
weeping
on
john
shoulder
now
john
caldigate
was
certainly
not
her
son
in
the
usual
acceptation
of
the
word
nor
did
maria
shand
believe
that
he
was
so
even
in
that
limited
sense
in
which
a
daughter
husband
may
be
so
designated
it
was
altogether
very
disagreeable
and
made
our
hero
almost
resolve
to
get
on
board
the
ship
a
week
before
it
started
from
the
thames
instead
of
going
down
to
plymouth
and
catching
it
at
the
last
moment
of
course
it
would
have
been
necessary
that
the
babingtons
should
know
all
about
it
sooner
or
later
but
john
very
much
regretted
that
he
had
not
delayed
his
letter
till
the
day
before
his
departure
there
is
something
jovial
when
you
are
young
in
preparing
for
a
long
voyage
and
for
totally
altered
circumstances
in
life
especially
when
the
surroundings
are
in
themselves
not
melancholy
a
mother
weeping
over
a
banished
child
may
be
sad
enough
going
as
an
exile
when
there
is
no
hope
of
a
return
but
here
among
the
shands
with
whom
sons
and
daughters
were
plentiful
and
with
whom
the
feelings
were
of
a
useful
kind
and
likely
to
wear
well
rather
than
of
a
romantic
nature
the
bustle
the
purchasings
the
arrangements
and
the
packings
generally
had
in
them
a
pleasantness
of
activity
with
no
disagreeable
accompaniments
do
hope
you
will
wear
them
dick
the
mother
said
with
something
like
a
sob
in
her
voice
but
the
tenderness
came
not
from
the
approaching
departure
but
from
her
fear
that
the
thick
woollen
drawers
on
which
she
was
all
the
buttons
should
be
neglected
after
dick
usual
fashion
caldigate
i
hope
you
will
see
that
he
wears
them
he
looks
strong
but
indeed
he
is
not
our
hero
who
had
always
regarded
his
friend
as
a
bull
for
strength
of
constitution
generally
promised
that
he
would
be
attentive
to
dick
drawers
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
wear
them
said
dick
the
time
will
come
when
i
shall
probably
wear
nothing
else
so
you
had
better
make
the
buttons
firm
everything
was
to
be
done
with
strict
economy
but
yet
there
was
plenty
of
money
for
purchases
there
always
is
at
such
occasions
the
quantity
of
clothes
got
together
seemed
to
be
more
than
any
two
men
could
ever
wear
and
among
it
all
there
were
no
and
no
or
if
either
of
them
had
such
articles
they
were
smuggled
the
two
young
men
were
going
out
as
miners
and
took
a
delight
in
preparing
themselves
to
be
rough
caldigate
was
at
first
somewhat
modest
in
submitting
his
own
belongings
to
the
females
of
the
establishment
but
that
feeling
soon
wore
off
and
the
markings
and
mendings
and
buttonings
and
hemmings
went
on
in
a
strictly
impartial
manner
as
though
he
himself
were
a
chick
out
of
the
same
brood
will
you
do
said
the
doctor
you
spend
your
capital
and
make
nothing
for
wages
said
dick
shall
have
got
at
any
rate
enough
experience
out
of
our
money
to
be
able
to
do
that
men
are
getting
you
have
to
go
on
doing
that
always
said
the
mother
at
all
of
course
it
a
life
of
ups
and
downs
a
man
working
for
wages
can
put
half
what
he
earns
into
a
claim
so
that
when
a
thing
does
come
up
trumps
at
last
he
will
have
his
chance
i
have
read
a
good
deal
about
it
now
there
is
plenty
to
be
got
if
a
man
only
knows
how
to
keep
it
is
the
worst
said
the
doctor
think
i
can
trust
myself
for
that
said
dick
whose
hand
at
the
moment
was
on
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
who
had
been
by
no
means
averse
to
jollifications
at
cambridge
miner
when
he
at
work
should
never
drink
when
he
not
at
work
if
he
wants
to
keep
what
he
earns
not
going
to
take
the
pledge
or
anything
of
that
kind
continued
the
son
i
think
i
know
enough
of
it
all
not
to
fall
into
that
pit
during
this
discussion
caldigate
sat
silent
for
he
had
already
had
various
conversations
on
this
subject
with
his
friend
he
had
entertained
some
fears
which
were
not
perhaps
quite
removed
by
manly
assurances
a
cabin
had
been
taken
for
the
joint
use
of
the
young
men
on
board
the
goldfinder
a
large
steamer
which
was
running
at
the
time
from
london
to
melbourne
doing
the
voyage
generally
in
about
two
months
but
they
were
going
as
passengers
and
their
accommodation
therefore
was
limited
dick
had
insisted
on
this
economy
which
was
hardly
necessary
to
caldigate
and
which
was
not
absolutely
pressed
upon
the
other
but
dick
had
insisted
us
begin
as
we
mean
to
go
on
he
had
said
course
we
got
to
rough
it
we
shall
come
across
something
a
good
deal
harder
than
fare
before
we
have
made
our
fortunes
and
worked
probably
with
mates
more
uncouth
than
passengers
it
was
impossible
to
oppose
counsel
such
as
this
and
therefore
tickets
were
taken
on
board
the
goldfinder
a
terrible
struggle
was
made
during
the
last
fortnight
to
prevent
the
going
of
john
caldigate
babington
was
so
shocked
that
he
did
not
cease
to
stir
himself
allow
a
son
to
disinherit
himself
merely
because
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
jew
before
he
had
left
college
to
have
the
whole
condition
of
a
property
changed
by
such
a
simple
accident
it
was
shocking
to
him
and
he
moved
himself
in
the
matter
with
much
more
energy
than
old
caldigate
had
expected
from
him
he
wrote
heartrending
letters
to
folking
in
spite
of
the
hard
words
which
had
been
said
to
him
there
he
made
a
second
journey
to
cambridge
and
endeavoured
to
frighten
bolton
descent
of
acres
from
father
to
son
was
to
him
so
holy
a
thing
that
he
was
roused
to
unexpected
energies
he
was
so
far
successful
that
daniel
caldigate
did
write
a
long
letter
to
his
son
in
which
he
offered
to
annul
the
whole
proceeding
uncle
accuses
me
of
injustice
he
said
have
not
been
unjust
but
there
is
no
reason
whatever
why
the
arrangement
should
stand
even
if
the
money
has
been
paid
to
davis
i
will
bear
that
loss
rather
than
you
should
think
that
i
have
taken
advantage
of
you
in
your
troubles
but
john
caldigate
was
too
firm
and
too
determined
for
such
retrogression
the
money
had
been
paid
to
davis
and
other
monies
had
been
used
in
other
directions
he
was
quite
contented
with
the
bargain
and
would
certainly
adhere
to
it
then
came
the
last
night
before
their
departure
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
they
were
to
go
from
pollington
to
london
and
from
london
to
plymouth
all
the
heavy
packages
and
all
the
clothes
had
of
course
been
put
on
board
the
goldfinder
in
the
london
docks
the
pleasant
task
of
preparation
was
at
an
end
and
they
were
now
to
go
forth
upon
their
hard
labours
caldigate
had
become
so
intimate
with
the
family
that
it
seemed
as
though
a
new
life
had
sprung
up
for
him
and
that
as
he
had
parted
from
all
that
he
then
had
of
a
family
at
folking
he
was
now
to
break
away
from
new
ties
under
the
doctor
roof
they
had
dined
early
and
at
ten
there
was
what
shand
called
a
little
bit
of
supper
they
were
all
of
them
high
in
heart
and
very
happy
testifying
their
affection
to
the
departing
ones
by
helping
them
to
the
nicest
bits
and
by
filling
their
tumblers
the
fullest
how
it
happened
no
one
could
have
said
but
it
did
happen
that
before
the
evening
was
over
maria
and
caldigate
were
together
in
a
little
room
behind
the
front
parlour
what
still
remained
of
their
luggage
was
collected
there
and
this
last
visit
had
probably
been
made
in
order
that
the
packages
might
be
once
more
counted
does
seem
so
odd
that
you
should
be
going
she
said
is
so
odd
to
me
that
i
should
ever
have
come
had
always
heard
of
you
since
dick
went
to
cambridge
knew
that
there
were
so
many
of
you
and
that
was
all
brothers
never
talk
of
their
sisters
i
suppose
but
i
seem
to
know
you
now
so
well
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
you
are
dick
friend
did
suppose
that
it
was
anything
else
not
nice
of
you
caldigate
you
know
that
we
are
all
very
fond
of
you
we
shall
be
so
anxious
to
hear
you
will
be
good
to
him
wo
you
he
to
me
i
hope
think
you
are
steadier
than
he
is
and
can
do
more
for
him
than
he
can
for
you
i
wonder
shall
we
ever
see
each
other
again
mr
caldigate
not
south
wales
is
so
far
and
you
will
both
marry
there
and
then
you
will
not
want
to
come
back
i
hope
i
may
live
to
see
dear
dick
again
some
day
only
dick
you
too
if
you
would
care
about
it
course
i
should
care
about
it
he
said
and
as
he
said
so
of
course
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
it
did
not
mean
much
she
did
not
think
it
meant
much
but
it
gave
a
little
colouring
of
romance
to
that
special
moment
of
her
life
he
when
he
went
up
to
his
bed
declared
to
himself
that
it
meant
nothing
at
all
he
still
had
those
large
eyes
clear
before
him
and
was
still
fixed
in
his
resolution
to
come
back
for
them
when
some
undefined
point
of
his
life
should
have
passed
by
said
dick
shand
as
they
were
seated
together
in
a
railway
carriage
on
the
following
morning
i
feel
that
i
am
beginning
life
proper
resolutions
i
hope
as
to
honesty
sobriety
and
industry
a
fixed
determination
to
make
a
fortune
and
come
back
and
be
among
all
the
shands
i
have
already
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
sum
i
will
give
each
of
the
girls
and
the
way
i
will
start
the
two
younger
boys
in
business
in
the
meantime
let
us
light
a
pipe
chapter
v
the
goldfinder
there
is
no
peculiar
life
more
thoroughly
apart
from
life
in
general
more
unlike
our
usual
life
more
completely
a
life
of
itself
governed
by
its
own
rules
and
having
its
own
roughnesses
and
amenities
than
life
on
board
ship
what
tender
friendship
it
produces
and
what
bitter
enmities
how
completely
the
society
has
formed
itself
into
separate
sets
after
the
three
or
four
first
days
how
thoroughly
it
is
acknowledged
that
this
is
the
aristocratic
set
and
that
the
plebeian
how
determined
are
the
aristocrats
to
admit
no
intrusion
and
how
anxious
are
the
plebeians
to
intrude
then
there
arises
the
great
demagogue
who
heads
a
party
having
probably
been
disappointed
in
early
life
that
is
in
his
first
endeavours
on
board
the
ship
and
the
women
have
to
acknowledge
all
their
weaknesses
and
to
exercise
all
their
strength
it
is
a
bad
time
for
them
on
board
ship
if
they
can
not
secure
the
attention
of
the
men
as
it
is
in
the
other
world
but
in
order
that
they
may
secure
it
they
assume
indifference
they
assume
indifference
but
are
hard
at
work
with
their
usual
weapons
the
men
can
do
very
well
by
themselves
for
them
there
is
drinking
smoking
cards
and
various
games
but
the
potency
of
female
spells
soon
works
upon
them
and
all
who
are
worth
anything
are
more
or
less
in
love
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
course
it
must
all
come
to
an
end
when
the
port
is
reached
that
is
understood
though
there
may
sometimes
be
mistakes
most
pathetic
secrets
are
told
with
the
consciousness
that
they
will
be
forgotten
as
soon
as
the
ship
is
left
and
there
is
the
whole
day
for
these
occupations
no
work
is
required
from
any
one
the
lawyer
does
not
go
to
his
court
nor
the
merchant
to
his
desk
receives
no
bills
orders
no
dinners
the
daughter
has
no
household
linen
to
disturb
her
the
son
is
never
recalled
to
his
books
there
is
no
parliament
no
municipality
no
vestry
there
are
neither
rates
nor
taxes
nor
rents
to
be
paid
the
government
is
the
softest
despotism
under
which
subjects
were
ever
allowed
to
do
almost
just
as
they
please
that
the
captain
has
a
power
is
known
but
hardly
felt
he
smiles
on
all
is
responsible
for
everything
really
rules
the
world
submitted
to
him
from
the
setting
of
the
sails
down
to
the
frying
of
the
chops
and
makes
one
fancy
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
men
on
shore
because
nations
can
not
be
governed
like
ships
the
goldfinder
had
on
board
her
over
a
hundred
passengers
and
nearly
as
many
of
the
second
class
the
life
among
them
was
much
of
the
same
kind
though
in
the
second
class
there
was
less
of
idleness
less
of
pleasure
and
something
more
of
an
attempt
to
continue
the
ordinary
industry
of
life
the
women
worked
more
and
the
men
read
more
than
their
richer
neighbours
but
the
and
the
fashion
and
the
mutiny
against
the
fashion
were
the
same
in
one
set
as
in
the
other
our
friends
were
at
first
subjected
to
an
inconvenience
which
is
always
felt
in
such
a
position
they
were
known
to
have
had
saloon
rather
than
antecedents
everybody
had
heard
that
they
had
been
at
cambridge
and
therefore
they
were
at
first
avoided
and
as
they
themselves
were
determined
not
to
seek
associates
among
their
more
aristocratic
neighbours
they
were
left
to
themselves
and
solitary
for
some
few
days
but
this
was
a
condition
not
at
all
suited
to
dick
shand
temperament
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
made
both
male
and
female
acquaintances
you
observed
that
woman
in
the
brown
straw
hat
dick
said
to
caldigate
one
morning
as
they
were
leaning
together
on
the
forepart
of
the
vessel
against
one
of
the
pens
in
which
the
fowls
were
kept
they
were
both
dressed
according
to
the
parts
they
were
acting
and
which
they
intended
to
act
as
passengers
and
future
working
miners
any
one
knowing
in
such
matters
would
have
seen
that
they
were
for
the
real
miner
when
he
is
away
from
his
work
puts
on
his
best
clothes
and
endeavours
to
look
as
little
rough
as
possible
and
all
this
had
no
doubt
been
seen
and
felt
and
discounted
among
our
friends
have
seen
her
every
day
of
course
said
caldigate
have
been
looking
at
her
for
the
last
half
hour
is
looking
at
us
now
seems
to
me
to
be
very
attentive
to
the
stocking
she
is
mending
a
woman
wiles
at
this
moment
she
ca
hear
us
but
she
knows
pretty
nearly
what
we
are
saying
by
the
way
our
lips
are
going
have
you
spoken
to
her
did
say
a
word
or
two
to
her
yesterday
did
she
say
do
recollect
especially
she
struck
me
as
talking
better
than
her
gown
if
you
know
what
i
mean
talks
a
great
deal
better
than
her
gown
said
dick
do
quite
know
what
to
make
of
her
she
says
that
she
is
going
out
to
earn
her
bread
but
when
i
asked
her
how
she
either
could
or
would
answer
me
she
is
a
mystery
and
mysteries
are
always
worth
unravelling
i
shall
go
to
work
and
unravel
her
at
that
moment
the
female
of
whom
they
were
speaking
got
up
from
her
seat
on
one
of
the
spars
which
was
bound
upon
the
deck
folded
up
her
work
and
walked
away
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
and
certainly
looked
to
be
better
than
her
gown
which
was
old
and
common
enough
caldigate
had
observed
her
frequently
and
had
been
much
struck
by
the
word
or
two
she
had
spoken
to
him
on
the
preceding
day
should
like
well
enough
she
had
said
in
answer
to
some
ordinary
question
it
led
to
nothing
else
would
not
remain
here
for
ever
if
i
could
there
is
plenty
to
eat
and
a
bed
to
sleep
on
and
no
one
to
be
afraid
of
and
though
nobody
knows
me
everybody
knows
enough
of
me
not
to
think
that
i
ought
to
be
taken
to
a
police
office
because
i
have
not
gloves
to
my
hands
you
think
it
wearisome
he
had
asked
is
wearisome
but
here
i
have
a
proud
feeling
of
having
paid
my
way
to
have
settled
in
advance
for
your
dinner
for
six
weeks
to
come
is
a
magnificent
thing
if
i
get
too
tired
of
it
i
can
throw
myself
overboard
you
ca
even
do
that
in
london
without
the
police
being
down
upon
you
the
only
horror
to
me
here
is
that
there
will
so
soon
be
an
end
to
it
at
that
time
he
had
not
even
heard
her
name
or
known
whether
she
were
alone
or
joined
to
others
then
he
had
inquired
and
a
female
had
informed
him
that
she
was
a
smith
that
she
had
seen
better
days
but
had
been
married
to
a
husband
who
had
drank
himself
to
death
within
a
year
of
their
marriage
and
that
she
was
now
going
out
to
the
colony
probably
so
the
old
lady
said
who
was
the
informant
in
search
of
a
second
husband
she
was
to
some
extent
the
old
lady
said
in
charge
of
a
distant
relative
who
was
then
on
board
with
a
respectable
husband
and
children
and
who
was
very
much
ashamed
of
her
poor
connection
so
much
john
caldigate
had
heard
though
he
had
heard
this
he
did
not
feel
inclined
to
tell
it
all
to
dick
shand
dick
had
professed
his
intention
of
unravelling
the
mystery
but
caldigate
almost
thought
that
he
would
like
to
unravel
it
himself
the
woman
was
so
constantly
alone
and
then
though
she
was
untidy
almost
unkempt
on
occasions
still
through
it
all
there
was
something
attractive
about
her
there
was
a
brightness
in
her
eye
and
a
courage
about
her
mouth
which
had
made
him
think
that
in
spite
of
her
appearance
she
would
be
worth
his
attention
just
for
the
voyage
when
he
had
been
speaking
to
herself
they
had
been
on
the
deck
together
and
it
had
been
dusk
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
look
her
in
the
face
but
while
shand
had
been
speaking
to
him
he
had
observed
that
she
was
very
comely
and
this
was
the
more
remarkable
because
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
so
evident
that
she
made
the
worst
rather
than
the
best
of
herself
she
was
quite
a
young
woman
probably
he
thought
not
more
than
three
or
four
and
twenty
and
she
was
there
with
many
young
men
round
her
and
yet
she
made
no
effort
to
attract
attention
when
his
eye
had
fallen
upon
her
she
had
generally
been
quite
alone
doing
some
piece
of
coarse
and
ordinary
work
have
had
another
conversation
with
her
said
shand
to
him
that
night
you
unravelled
the
mystery
quite
but
i
have
got
the
fact
that
there
is
a
mystery
she
told
me
that
you
and
i
and
she
herself
ought
not
to
be
here
when
i
asked
her
why
she
said
that
you
and
i
ought
to
be
gentlemen
and
that
she
ought
to
be
a
lady
i
told
her
that
you
and
i
were
gentlemen
in
spite
of
our
trousers
ah
she
said
there
comes
the
difference
i
not
a
lady
any
longer
when
i
contradicted
her
she
snubbed
me
and
said
that
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
to
know
anything
about
it
but
i
have
it
all
out
of
her
before
i
done
for
some
days
after
that
caldigate
kept
himself
aloof
from
smith
not
at
all
because
he
had
ceased
to
notice
her
or
to
think
about
her
but
from
a
feeling
of
dislike
to
exhibit
rivalry
with
his
friend
shand
was
making
himself
very
particular
and
he
thought
that
shand
was
a
fool
for
his
pains
he
was
becoming
angry
with
shand
and
had
serious
thoughts
of
speaking
to
him
with
solemn
severity
what
could
such
a
woman
be
to
him
but
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
there
was
something
akin
to
jealousy
the
woman
was
and
certainly
clever
and
was
very
interesting
shand
for
two
or
three
evenings
running
related
his
success
how
smith
had
communicated
to
him
the
fact
that
she
utterly
despised
those
cromptons
who
were
distant
cousins
of
her
late
husband
and
with
whom
she
had
come
on
board
how
she
preferred
to
be
alone
to
having
aught
to
do
with
them
how
she
had
one
or
two
books
with
her
and
passed
some
hours
in
reading
and
how
she
was
poor
very
poor
but
still
had
something
on
which
to
live
for
a
few
weeks
after
landing
but
caldigate
fancied
that
there
must
be
a
betrayal
of
trust
in
these
revelations
and
though
he
was
in
truth
interested
about
the
woman
did
not
give
much
encouragement
to
his
friend
my
word
he
said
do
seem
to
care
so
very
much
about
smith
affairs
do
said
shand
who
was
and
irrepressible
declared
my
intention
of
unravelling
the
mystery
and
i
mean
to
do
it
hope
you
are
not
too
inquisitive
course
she
likes
to
have
some
one
to
whom
she
can
talk
and
what
can
people
talk
about
on
board
ship
except
themselves
a
woman
who
has
a
mystery
always
likes
to
have
it
unravelled
what
else
is
the
good
of
a
mystery
he
was
and
irrepressible
but
caldigate
endeavoured
to
show
his
displeasure
he
felt
that
the
poor
woman
was
in
coarse
hands
and
he
thought
that
had
matters
gone
otherwise
he
might
have
accepted
in
a
more
delicate
manner
so
much
confidence
as
she
chose
to
vouchsafe
so
it
was
when
they
had
been
a
fortnight
at
sea
they
had
left
home
in
but
now
they
were
in
the
tropics
near
the
line
and
everything
was
sultry
sleepy
and
warm
were
jumping
from
the
waves
on
to
the
deck
and
when
the
dusk
of
night
was
come
the
passengers
would
stand
by
the
hour
together
watching
the
phosphorus
on
the
water
the
southern
cross
had
shown
itself
plainly
and
possessed
the
heavens
in
conjunction
with
the
bear
the
thick
woollen
drawers
which
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
were
no
longer
in
use
and
men
were
going
about
in
light
pantaloons
and
linen
jackets
those
on
the
at
first
beautifully
clean
and
white
while
our
friends
of
the
second
cabin
were
less
careful
the
women
too
had
got
quit
of
their
wraps
and
lounged
about
the
deck
in
light
attire
during
the
bright
hours
of
the
day
the
aristocrats
in
the
stern
were
shrouded
from
the
sun
by
a
delightful
awning
but
forward
the
passengers
sought
the
shade
of
the
loose
idle
sails
or
screened
themselves
from
the
fierce
rays
as
best
they
might
among
the
hatchways
and
woodwork
but
it
was
when
the
burning
sun
had
hidden
himself
when
the
short
twilight
had
disappeared
and
the
heavens
were
alive
and
alight
with
stars
that
all
the
world
of
the
ship
would
be
crowded
on
the
upper
deck
there
they
would
remain
long
after
the
lamps
below
had
been
extinguished
some
of
them
sleeping
through
the
whole
night
in
the
comparative
coolness
of
the
air
but
it
was
from
eight
when
tea
would
be
over
till
midnight
that
the
hum
of
voices
would
be
thickest
and
the
tread
of
those
who
walked
for
their
exercise
the
most
frequent
at
such
times
caldigate
would
be
often
alone
for
though
he
had
made
acquaintances
and
had
become
indeed
intimate
with
some
of
those
around
him
he
had
never
thrust
himself
into
the
life
of
the
ship
as
shand
had
done
charades
were
acted
in
the
second
cabin
in
which
shand
always
took
part
and
there
were
penny
readings
at
which
shand
was
often
the
reader
and
he
smoked
much
and
drank
somewhat
with
those
who
smoked
and
drank
the
awe
at
first
inspired
by
his
university
superiority
and
supposed
rank
in
the
world
had
faded
almost
into
nothing
but
by
caldigate
unconsciously
much
of
this
had
been
preserved
i
am
not
sure
that
he
did
not
envy
his
friend
but
at
any
rate
he
stood
aloof
and
in
regard
to
smith
when
he
saw
her
walking
one
evening
with
shand
in
the
sweetly
dim
light
of
the
evening
with
her
hand
upon
shand
arm
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
think
no
more
about
her
they
had
been
at
sea
just
a
fortnight
when
this
happened
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
this
resolve
had
been
formed
smith
was
standing
by
him
and
talking
to
him
a
ball
was
being
held
on
the
or
rather
as
there
was
in
truth
no
to
the
goldfinder
on
that
clean
large
luxurious
expanse
devoted
to
the
aristocracy
in
the
of
the
vessel
from
among
the
passengers
two
fiddlers
and
a
flute
player
had
been
procured
who
formed
the
band
at
sea
you
have
always
to
look
for
your
musicians
among
the
passengers
and
now
under
the
awning
young
and
old
were
standing
up
and
making
themselves
happy
beneath
the
starlight
and
the
glimmer
of
the
dozen
which
had
been
hung
around
on
board
ship
there
are
many
sources
of
joy
of
which
the
land
knows
nothing
you
may
flirt
and
dance
at
sixty
and
if
you
are
awkward
in
the
turn
of
a
valse
you
may
put
it
down
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
you
need
wear
no
gloves
and
may
drink
your
without
being
ashamed
of
it
it
was
not
for
john
caldigate
to
join
the
mazes
of
that
dance
though
he
would
have
liked
it
well
and
was
well
fitted
by
skill
and
taste
for
such
exercise
but
the
ground
was
hallowed
on
which
they
trod
and
forbidden
to
him
and
though
there
was
probably
not
a
girl
or
a
dancing
married
woman
there
who
would
not
have
been
proud
to
stand
up
with
caldigate
of
folking
there
was
not
one
who
would
have
dared
to
take
the
hand
of
a
passenger
so
he
stood
just
within
his
own
boundary
and
looked
and
longed
then
there
was
a
voice
in
his
ear
you
dance
mr
caldigate
it
was
a
very
pleasant
voice
low
but
distinct
and
silvery
infinitely
better
again
than
the
gown
a
voice
so
distinct
and
that
it
would
have
been
noticed
for
its
peculiar
sweetness
if
coming
from
any
lady
he
turned
round
and
found
her
face
close
to
his
why
had
she
come
to
speak
to
him
when
she
must
have
perceived
that
he
had
intentionally
avoided
her
used
to
be
very
fond
of
dancing
he
said
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
have
gone
away
too
was
fond
of
dancing
but
as
you
say
it
has
gone
away
it
will
come
back
to
you
in
years
perhaps
it
can
never
come
back
to
me
things
do
come
back
to
men
more
than
to
women
have
a
resurrection
i
mean
here
upon
earth
we
never
have
though
we
live
as
long
as
you
the
years
of
our
lives
are
much
shorter
we
burst
out
into
full
flowering
early
in
our
spring
but
long
before
the
summer
is
over
we
are
no
more
than
huddled
leaves
and
thick
stalks
you
a
thick
stalk
mrs
smith
not
my
flowers
are
gone
while
my
stalk
is
still
thin
and
sensitive
and
then
women
ca
recuperate
do
quite
know
what
that
means
you
do
it
is
good
english
enough
even
for
cambridge
by
this
time
if
you
had
made
a
false
step
got
into
debt
and
ran
away
or
mistaken
another
man
wife
for
your
own
or
disappeared
altogether
under
a
cloud
for
a
while
you
could
retrieve
your
honour
and
sinking
at
or
thirty
could
come
up
from
out
of
the
waters
at
as
capable
of
enjoyment
and
almost
as
fresh
as
ever
but
a
woman
does
not
bear
submersion
she
is
draggled
ever
afterwards
she
must
hide
everything
by
a
life
of
lies
or
she
will
get
no
admittance
anywhere
the
man
is
rather
the
better
liked
because
he
has
sown
his
wild
oats
broadly
of
all
these
ladies
dancing
there
which
dances
the
best
there
is
not
one
who
really
knows
how
to
dance
chapter
vi
smith
she
had
changed
the
conversation
so
suddenly
rushing
off
from
that
great
question
as
to
the
condition
of
women
generally
to
the
very
unimportant
matter
of
the
dancing
powers
of
the
ladies
who
were
manoeuvring
before
them
that
caldigate
hardly
knew
how
to
travel
with
her
so
quickly
all
dance
well
enough
for
ship
dancing
he
replied
as
to
what
you
were
saying
about
women
caldigate
they
do
dance
well
enough
for
ship
dancing
dancing
wherever
it
be
done
should
be
graceful
a
woman
may
at
any
rate
move
her
feet
in
accordance
with
time
and
she
need
not
skip
nor
prance
nor
jump
even
on
board
ship
look
at
that
stout
lady
callander
everybody
by
this
time
knew
everybody
name
she
is
mrs
callander
smith
no
doubt
knew
very
well
that
it
was
callander
not
your
ear
catch
separately
the
thud
of
her
footfall
every
time
she
comes
to
the
ground
is
fat
fair
and
forty
enough
and
what
she
lacks
in
fairness
may
be
added
on
to
the
forty
but
if
she
were
less
ambitious
and
had
a
glimmer
of
taste
she
might
do
better
than
that
you
see
that
girl
with
the
green
scarf
round
her
she
is
young
and
why
should
she
spring
about
like
a
bear
on
a
hot
iron
should
go
and
teach
them
is
just
what
i
should
like
only
they
would
not
be
taught
and
i
should
be
stern
and
tell
them
the
truth
do
you
go
and
dance
with
them
yourself
not
there
is
one
lady
there
this
was
true
for
though
none
of
the
men
would
have
been
admitted
from
the
inferior
rank
to
join
the
superior
the
rule
of
demarcation
had
so
far
been
broken
that
a
pretty
girl
who
was
known
to
some
of
the
passengers
had
been
invited
to
come
over
the
line
and
join
the
amusements
of
the
evening
dances
about
as
well
as
any
of
them
you
were
among
them
would
you
dare
to
come
out
and
ask
me
to
join
them
that
is
a
question
which
you
wo
even
dare
to
answer
is
a
little
personal
no
you
ought
to
say
i
could
not
do
that
because
your
clothes
are
so
poor
and
because
of
your
ragged
old
hat
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
your
shoes
are
fit
to
be
seen
is
not
that
what
you
would
say
if
you
said
what
you
thought
it
is
if
you
said
all
that
you
thought
perhaps
you
would
remind
me
that
a
woman
of
whom
nobody
knows
anything
is
always
held
to
be
disreputable
that
girl
no
doubt
has
her
decent
belongings
i
have
nobody
have
your
friends
on
board
i
have
not
i
have
not
a
single
friend
on
board
those
cromptons
were
very
unwillingly
persuaded
to
take
a
sort
of
interest
in
me
though
they
really
know
nothing
about
me
and
i
have
already
lost
any
good
which
might
come
from
their
protection
she
told
me
yesterday
that
i
ought
not
to
walk
about
with
mr
shand
what
did
you
say
course
i
told
her
to
mind
her
own
business
i
had
no
alternative
a
woman
has
to
show
a
little
spirit
or
she
will
be
trodden
absolutely
into
the
dirt
it
was
something
to
have
a
woman
to
speak
to
even
though
i
had
not
a
thought
in
common
with
her
though
she
was
to
my
feeling
as
inferior
to
myself
as
i
no
doubt
am
thought
to
be
by
that
fat
prancing
woman
to
herself
even
crompton
countenance
was
of
value
but
if
i
had
yielded
she
would
have
taken
it
out
in
tyranny
so
now
we
speak
is
a
pity
is
a
pity
you
watch
them
all
and
see
how
they
look
at
me
the
women
i
mean
they
know
that
shand
speaks
to
me
and
that
you
and
shand
are
the
two
gentlemen
we
have
among
us
there
are
no
doubt
a
dozen
of
them
watching
me
now
somewhere
and
denouncing
me
for
the
impropriety
of
my
behaviour
it
improper
do
you
think
may
we
not
talk
as
well
as
others
but
there
are
people
who
are
tabooed
look
at
that
miss
green
and
the
ship
doctor
at
that
moment
the
ship
doctor
and
the
young
lady
in
question
came
close
to
them
in
the
dance
is
no
harm
in
miss
green
talking
by
the
hour
together
with
the
doctor
because
she
is
comfortably
placed
she
has
got
an
old
father
and
mother
on
board
who
do
look
after
her
and
everything
is
respectable
but
if
i
show
any
of
the
same
propensities
i
ought
almost
to
be
put
into
irons
anybody
else
been
harsh
to
you
captain
has
been
making
inquiries
no
doubt
with
the
idea
that
he
may
at
last
be
driven
to
harsh
measures
have
you
got
a
sister
a
mother
a
housemaid
even
a
housemaid
i
have
no
female
belongings
whatever
you
know
that
if
you
had
a
sister
and
a
mother
and
a
housemaid
your
mother
would
quite
expect
that
your
sister
should
in
time
have
a
lover
but
that
she
would
be
horrified
at
the
idea
of
the
housemaid
having
a
follower
did
not
know
that
i
thought
housemaids
got
married
sometimes
nature
is
stronger
than
tyranny
what
does
all
this
mean
you
are
not
a
housemaid
and
you
have
not
got
a
mistress
exactly
but
at
present
if
i
say
my
outward
woman
you
know
what
i
mean
perhaps
think
i
shall
my
present
outward
woman
stands
to
me
in
lieu
of
the
broom
and
the
united
authority
of
the
captain
and
crompton
make
up
the
mistress
between
them
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
though
i
have
to
endure
the
tyranny
i
have
not
got
the
follower
it
is
as
hard
upon
shand
as
it
is
upon
me
i
suppose
can
take
care
of
himself
doubt
and
so
in
real
truth
can
i
can
stand
apart
and
defy
them
all
and
as
i
look
at
them
looking
at
me
and
almost
know
with
what
words
they
are
maligning
me
i
can
tell
myself
that
they
are
beneath
me
and
that
i
care
nothing
for
them
i
shall
do
nothing
which
will
enable
any
one
to
interfere
with
me
but
it
seems
hard
that
all
this
should
be
so
because
i
am
a
widow
and
because
i
am
alone
and
because
i
am
poorly
clothed
as
she
said
this
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
true
ones
and
something
of
the
sound
of
a
broken
sob
in
her
voice
and
caldigate
was
moved
the
woman
condition
was
to
be
pitied
whether
it
had
been
produced
with
or
without
fault
on
her
own
part
to
be
alone
is
always
sad
even
for
a
man
but
for
a
woman
and
for
a
young
woman
it
is
doubly
melancholy
of
a
sudden
the
dancing
was
done
and
the
lamps
were
taken
away
you
do
not
want
to
go
to
bed
he
said
us
take
a
turn
never
go
to
bed
i
mean
here
on
board
ship
i
linger
up
on
deck
half
hiding
myself
about
the
place
till
i
see
some
quartermaster
eying
me
suspiciously
and
then
i
creep
down
into
the
little
hole
which
i
occupy
with
three
of
crompton
children
and
then
i
cry
myself
to
sleep
but
i
do
call
that
going
to
bed
a
turn
now
shall
feel
like
the
housemaid
talking
to
her
follower
through
the
but
she
is
brave
and
why
should
i
be
a
coward
then
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
you
she
said
are
not
you
dancing
in
the
other
part
of
the
ship
with
callander
and
miss
green
instead
of
picking
your
way
among
the
hencoops
here
with
me
suited
my
pocket
best
and
my
future
prospects
are
making
a
delightful
experiment
in
roughing
it
as
people
eat
dinners
out
in
the
woods
occasionally
so
that
there
may
be
a
break
in
the
monotony
of
chairs
and
tables
while
shand
had
been
unravelling
her
mystery
she
perhaps
had
been
more
successful
in
unravelling
his
intend
to
be
miners
to
return
home
before
long
with
some
vast
treasure
i
hope
you
may
be
successful
seem
to
doubt
it
course
it
is
doubtful
if
not
the
thing
would
be
common
and
hardly
worth
the
doing
will
shand
be
very
persistent
as
a
working
miner
hope
so
seems
to
me
to
have
great
gifts
of
idleness
which
on
board
ship
are
a
blessing
how
i
do
envy
men
when
i
see
them
smoking
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
them
women
have
their
needlework
but
though
they
hate
it
less
than
idleness
they
do
hate
it
but
you
really
like
your
tobacco
do
like
being
idle
i
read
a
good
deal
do
you
read
have
but
few
books
here
i
have
read
more
perhaps
than
most
young
women
of
my
age
i
came
away
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
have
almost
nothing
with
me
i
lend
you
books
you
will
i
will
promise
to
take
care
of
them
have
the
heartbroken
one
by
spratt
you
know
it
is
very
absurd
but
full
of
life
from
beginning
to
end
all
that
spratt
writes
is
very
lively
do
think
i
care
for
spratt
he
may
be
lively
but
he
not
michael
bamfold
it
is
hard
work
perhaps
but
very
thoughtful
if
you
can
digest
that
sort
of
thing
hate
thought
do
you
say
to
miss
bouverie
last
ridden
to
a
standstill
a
little
loud
perhaps
but
very
interesting
or
green
grow
the
rushes
o
by
tremaine
none
of
tremaine
people
do
anything
that
anybody
would
do
but
they
all
talk
well
hate
novels
written
by
women
their
girls
are
so
unlovely
and
their
men
such
absurdly
fine
fellows
have
william
coxe
lock
picked
at
last
of
which
i
will
defy
you
to
find
the
secret
till
you
have
got
to
the
end
of
it
am
a
great
deal
too
impatient
thompson
four
marquises
that
wo
give
you
any
trouble
because
you
will
know
it
all
from
the
first
chapter
never
have
a
moment
of
excitement
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
i
do
think
i
care
very
much
for
novels
have
you
nothing
else
caldigate
had
many
other
books
a
shakespeare
some
lighter
poetry
and
sundry
heavier
works
of
which
he
did
not
wish
specially
to
speak
lest
he
should
seem
to
be
boasting
of
his
own
literary
taste
but
at
last
it
was
settled
that
on
the
next
morning
he
should
supply
her
with
what
choice
he
had
among
the
poets
then
at
about
midnight
they
parted
and
caldigate
as
he
found
his
way
down
to
his
cabin
saw
the
quartermaster
with
his
eye
fixed
upon
smith
there
is
no
so
stern
guardian
of
morality
and
propriety
as
your
old
quartermaster
on
board
a
ship
have
been
having
a
grand
time
of
it
with
smith
said
shand
as
soon
as
caldigate
was
in
their
cabin
well
as
far
as
fine
times
go
on
board
ship
is
there
anything
against
it
no
not
that
i
know
of
i
started
the
hare
if
you
choose
to
run
it
i
have
no
right
to
complain
i
suppose
do
know
anything
about
the
hare
but
you
certainly
have
no
right
to
complain
because
i
have
been
talking
to
smith
unless
indeed
you
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
make
her
mrs
shand
are
much
more
likely
to
make
her
mrs
caldigate
do
know
that
i
should
have
any
objection
that
is
if
i
wanted
a
wife
she
is
clever
and
would
be
were
it
not
that
she
bristles
up
against
the
of
the
world
too
roughly
did
know
it
had
gone
so
far
as
that
said
shand
angrily
did
i
till
you
suggested
it
to
me
now
i
think
i
go
to
sleep
if
you
please
and
dream
about
it
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
but
lay
awake
half
thinking
and
half
dreaming
he
certainly
liked
smith
but
then
as
he
had
begun
to
find
out
of
himself
he
liked
women
society
generally
he
was
almost
jealous
of
the
doctor
because
the
doctor
was
allowed
to
talk
to
miss
green
and
waltz
with
miss
green
whereas
he
could
not
approach
her
then
he
thought
of
maria
shand
and
that
kiss
in
the
little
back
parlour
the
kiss
which
had
not
meant
much
but
which
had
meant
something
and
then
of
julia
babington
to
whom
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
ought
not
to
feel
himself
engaged
but
the
face
that
was
clearest
to
him
of
all
and
which
became
the
dearer
the
nearer
that
he
approached
to
a
state
of
dozing
was
that
of
hester
bolton
whose
voice
he
had
hardly
heard
who
had
barely
spoken
to
him
the
tips
of
whose
fingers
he
had
only
just
touched
if
there
was
any
one
thing
fixed
on
his
mind
it
was
that
as
soon
as
he
had
put
together
a
large
lump
of
gold
he
would
go
back
to
cambridge
and
win
hester
bolton
to
be
his
wife
but
yet
what
a
singular
woman
was
this
smith
as
to
marrying
her
that
of
course
had
been
a
joke
produced
by
the
petulance
of
his
snoring
friend
he
began
to
dislike
shand
because
he
did
snore
so
loudly
and
drank
so
much
bottled
ale
and
smelt
so
strongly
of
cavendish
tobacco
smith
was
at
any
rate
much
too
good
for
shand
surely
she
must
have
been
a
lady
or
her
voice
would
not
have
been
sweet
and
silvery
and
though
she
did
bristle
roughly
against
the
of
the
world
and
say
strong
things
she
was
never
absolutely
indelicate
or
even
loud
and
she
was
certainly
very
interesting
how
did
it
come
to
pass
that
she
was
so
completely
alone
so
poor
so
unfriended
and
yet
possessed
of
such
gifts
there
certainly
was
a
mystery
and
it
would
certainly
be
his
fate
and
not
the
fate
of
dick
shand
to
unravel
it
the
puzzle
was
much
too
delicate
and
too
intricate
for
dick
shand
rough
hands
then
giving
his
last
waking
thoughts
for
a
moment
to
hester
bolton
he
went
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
snoring
on
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
bed
he
opened
a
small
portmanteau
in
which
he
had
put
up
some
volumes
the
day
before
he
left
pollington
and
to
which
he
had
not
yet
had
recourse
since
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
from
these
he
would
select
one
or
two
for
the
use
of
his
new
friend
so
he
dragged
out
the
valise
from
beneath
the
berth
while
shand
abused
him
for
the
disturbance
he
made
on
the
top
lying
on
the
other
volumes
which
were
as
he
had
placed
them
was
a
little
book
prettily
bound
by
no
means
new
which
he
was
sure
had
never
been
placed
there
by
himself
he
took
it
up
and
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
cabin
between
the
light
of
the
porthole
and
dick
bed
he
examined
it
it
was
a
copy
of
thomson
and
on
the
flyleaf
was
written
in
a
girl
hand
the
name
of
its
late
owner
maria
shand
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
at
once
she
must
have
gone
down
on
that
last
night
after
he
was
in
bed
and
thus
have
made
her
little
offering
in
silence
knowing
that
it
would
be
hidden
from
him
till
he
was
far
away
from
her
book
is
that
said
shand
suddenly
emerging
with
his
head
and
shoulders
from
the
low
berth
book
of
mine
said
caldigate
disconcerted
for
the
moment
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
am
looking
for
something
to
lend
to
mrs
smith
is
molly
thomson
seasons
said
the
brother
remembering
as
we
are
so
apt
to
remember
the
old
thing
that
had
met
his
eye
so
often
in
the
old
house
did
you
get
it
did
steal
it
dick
do
suppose
you
did
but
i
sure
it
the
book
i
say
doubt
it
is
if
you
think
it
is
in
bad
hands
shall
i
give
it
back
to
you
do
want
it
if
she
gave
it
you
she
was
a
fool
for
her
pains
do
see
that
would
rather
at
any
rate
that
you
would
not
lend
a
book
with
my
sister
name
in
it
to
mrs
smith
was
not
thinking
of
doing
so
she
wants
a
shakespeare
that
i
have
got
here
and
a
volume
of
tennyson
then
dick
retreated
back
into
his
berth
and
snored
again
while
caldigate
dressed
himself
when
that
operation
was
completed
which
including
his
lavations
occupied
about
five
minutes
he
went
up
on
the
deck
with
the
books
for
smith
in
his
hand
and
with
thomson
in
his
pocket
so
the
poor
girl
had
absolutely
stolen
in
the
middle
of
the
cold
night
and
had
opened
the
case
and
it
in
order
that
he
when
in
strange
lands
might
find
himself
in
possession
of
something
that
had
been
hers
he
had
not
been
alone
a
minute
or
two
and
was
looking
about
to
see
if
smith
was
there
when
he
was
accosted
by
the
captain
the
captain
was
a
handsome
man
about
years
of
age
who
had
the
good
word
of
almost
everybody
on
board
but
who
had
not
before
spoken
specially
to
caldigate
morning
caldigate
i
hope
you
find
yourself
fairly
comfortable
where
you
are
well
thank
you
captain
there
is
anything
i
can
do
have
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
expect
wish
caldigate
i
could
invite
you
and
your
friends
to
come
astern
among
us
sometimes
but
it
would
be
contrary
to
rule
can
quite
understand
that
captain
are
doing
a
bit
of
roughing
no
doubt
for
the
sake
of
experience
if
you
only
knew
the
sort
of
roughing
i
had
in
my
time
dare
say
pork
and
hard
biscuit
and
only
half
enough
of
that
you
find
yourself
among
some
queer
i
dare
say
mr
caldigate
is
very
civil
sure
to
be
that
to
a
gentleman
but
one
has
to
be
careful
the
women
are
the
most
dangerous
then
the
captain
laughed
as
though
it
had
only
been
a
joke
this
allusion
to
the
women
but
caldigate
knew
that
there
was
more
than
a
joke
in
it
the
captain
had
intended
to
warn
him
against
smith
chapter
vii
the
three
attempts
something
more
than
a
month
had
gone
by
and
john
caldigate
and
smith
were
very
close
companions
this
had
not
been
effected
without
considerable
opposition
partly
on
the
part
of
shand
and
partly
by
the
ship
inhabitants
generally
the
inhabitants
of
the
ship
were
inimical
to
smith
she
was
a
woman
who
had
no
friends
and
the
very
female
who
had
first
appeared
as
a
friend
was
now
the
readiest
to
say
hard
things
of
her
and
caldigate
was
a
handsome
young
man
by
this
time
all
the
ladies
in
the
knew
very
well
who
he
was
and
some
of
them
had
spoken
to
him
on
one
or
two
occasions
the
stern
law
of
the
vessel
had
been
broken
and
he
had
been
absolutely
invited
to
sit
on
those
august
he
was
known
to
be
a
gentleman
and
believed
on
the
evidence
of
dick
shand
to
be
possessed
of
considerable
means
it
was
therefore
a
thing
horrible
to
all
of
them
and
particularly
to
miss
green
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
enticed
into
difficulties
by
such
a
creature
as
that
smith
miss
green
had
already
been
a
little
cold
to
the
doctor
in
consequence
of
a
pleasant
spent
by
her
in
caldigate
company
as
they
looked
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
at
the
callander
had
been
with
them
and
everything
had
been
quite
proper
but
what
a
pity
it
was
that
he
should
devote
so
much
of
his
time
to
that
woman
his
condition
if
he
should
be
induced
to
marry
her
said
miss
green
holding
up
her
hands
in
horror
the
idea
was
so
terrible
that
callander
declared
that
she
would
speak
to
him
ever
disliked
interfering
so
much
as
i
do
said
callander
sometimes
a
word
from
a
lady
will
go
so
far
with
a
young
man
callander
was
a
most
respectable
woman
whose
father
had
begun
life
as
a
cattle
drover
in
the
colonies
but
had
succeeded
in
amassing
a
considerable
fortune
i
do
wish
that
something
may
be
done
to
save
him
said
miss
green
among
the
passengers
the
same
feeling
existed
quite
as
strongly
the
woman
herself
had
not
only
been
able
but
had
been
foolish
enough
to
show
that
in
spite
of
her
gown
she
considered
herself
superior
to
them
all
when
it
was
found
that
she
was
in
truth
handsome
to
look
upon
that
her
words
were
soft
and
well
chosen
that
she
could
sit
apart
and
read
and
that
she
could
trample
upon
crompton
in
her
scorn
then
for
a
while
there
were
some
who
made
little
efforts
to
get
into
her
good
graces
she
might
even
have
made
an
ally
of
bones
the
wife
of
the
butcher
who
was
going
out
with
his
large
family
to
try
his
fortune
at
melbourne
bones
had
been
injured
after
some
ship
fashion
by
crompton
and
would
have
made
herself
pleasant
but
smith
had
despised
them
all
and
had
shown
her
contempt
and
was
now
as
deeply
suspected
by
bones
as
by
crompton
or
callander
but
of
all
the
foes
to
this
intimacy
dick
shand
was
for
a
time
the
most
bitter
and
the
most
determined
no
doubt
this
arose
at
first
from
jealousy
he
had
declared
his
purpose
of
unravelling
the
mystery
but
the
task
had
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
and
the
unravelling
was
being
done
by
another
and
the
more
that
the
woman
was
abused
and
the
more
intent
were
all
the
people
in
regard
to
her
wicked
determination
to
be
intimate
with
caldigate
the
more
interesting
she
became
dick
who
was
himself
the
very
imp
of
imprudence
who
had
never
been
deterred
from
doing
anything
he
fancied
by
any
glimmer
of
control
would
have
been
delighted
to
be
the
hero
of
all
the
little
stories
that
were
being
told
but
as
that
morsel
of
bread
had
been
taken
as
it
were
from
between
his
very
teeth
by
the
unjustifiable
interference
of
his
friend
he
had
become
more
alive
than
any
one
else
to
the
danger
of
the
whole
proceeding
he
acknowledged
to
the
captain
that
his
friend
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
though
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
caldigate
he
resolved
upon
interfering
you
think
you
are
making
an
ass
of
yourself
about
this
woman
he
said
daresay
i
am
the
wise
men
from
david
downwards
have
made
asses
of
themselves
about
women
and
why
should
i
be
wiser
than
the
rest
nonsense
you
know
likely
am
trying
to
talk
to
you
in
earnest
make
such
a
failure
of
it
old
boy
that
i
am
compelled
to
talk
nonsense
in
return
the
idea
of
your
preaching
here
i
am
with
nothing
special
to
do
and
i
like
to
amuse
myself
ought
not
that
to
be
enough
for
you
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
dick
shand
asked
very
solemnly
can
i
tell
but
the
absurdity
is
that
such
a
man
as
you
should
talk
about
the
end
of
anything
did
you
ever
look
before
you
leaped
in
your
life
are
to
be
together
you
know
and
it
wo
do
for
us
to
be
hampered
with
that
woman
it
then
let
me
tell
you
that
if
i
choose
to
hamper
myself
with
that
woman
or
with
a
whole
harem
of
women
and
am
not
deterred
by
any
consideration
for
myself
i
certainly
shall
not
be
deterred
by
any
consideration
for
you
do
you
understand
me
is
not
being
a
true
partner
said
shand
quite
sure
of
this
that
i
likely
to
be
as
true
as
you
are
not
aware
that
i
have
entered
into
any
terms
with
you
by
which
i
have
bound
myself
to
any
special
mode
of
living
i
have
left
england
as
i
fancy
you
have
done
also
because
i
desired
more
conventional
freedom
than
one
can
find
among
the
folk
at
home
and
now
on
the
first
outset
i
am
to
be
cautioned
and
threatened
by
you
because
i
have
made
acquaintance
with
a
young
woman
of
all
the
moral
pastors
and
masters
that
one
might
come
across
in
the
world
you
dick
shand
appear
to
me
to
be
the
most
absurd
but
you
are
so
far
right
as
this
that
if
my
conduct
is
shocking
to
you
you
had
better
leave
me
to
my
wickedness
are
always
so
d
upsetting
said
dick
no
one
can
speak
to
you
then
dick
turned
away
and
there
was
nothing
more
said
about
smith
on
that
occasion
the
next
to
try
her
hand
was
callander
by
this
time
the
passengers
had
become
familiar
with
the
ship
and
knew
what
they
might
and
what
they
might
not
do
the
passengers
were
not
often
found
intruding
across
the
bar
but
the
frequently
made
visits
to
their
friends
amidships
in
this
way
callander
had
become
acquainted
with
our
two
and
often
found
herself
in
conversation
with
one
or
the
other
even
miss
green
as
has
been
stated
before
would
come
and
gaze
upon
the
waves
from
the
inferior
part
of
the
deck
a
very
nice
voyage
we
are
having
caldigate
callander
said
one
afternoon
indeed
it
is
getting
a
little
cold
now
but
we
shall
enjoy
that
after
all
the
heat
so
only
i
suppose
it
will
be
very
cold
when
we
get
quite
south
you
still
find
yourself
tolerably
comfortable
shall
be
glad
to
have
it
over
said
caldigate
who
had
in
truth
become
disgusted
with
dick
snoring
daresay
i
am
sure
we
shall
my
young
people
are
getting
very
tired
of
it
children
when
they
are
accustomed
to
every
comfort
on
shore
of
course
feel
it
grievously
i
suppose
you
are
rather
crowded
course
we
are
crowded
one
ca
have
a
square
room
on
board
ship
indeed
but
then
you
are
with
your
friend
and
that
is
much
pleasanter
than
a
stranger
would
depend
on
whether
the
stranger
snored
mrs
callander
talk
of
snoring
caldigate
if
you
only
heard
callander
but
as
i
was
saying
you
must
have
some
very
queer
characters
down
there
she
had
not
been
saying
anything
of
the
kind
but
she
found
a
difficulty
in
introducing
her
subject
them
altogether
they
are
a
very
decent
pleasant
set
of
people
and
all
of
them
in
earnest
about
their
future
lives
creatures
but
i
dare
say
they
very
good
then
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
into
his
face
she
had
undertaken
a
duty
and
she
was
not
the
woman
to
shrink
from
it
so
she
told
herself
at
that
moment
and
yet
she
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
as
she
saw
the
squareness
of
his
forehead
and
the
set
of
his
mouth
and
there
was
a
frown
across
his
brow
as
though
he
were
preparing
himself
to
fight
must
have
found
it
hard
to
accommodate
yourselves
to
them
mr
caldigate
at
all
course
we
all
know
that
you
are
a
gentleman
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
do
not
know
any
word
that
requires
a
definition
so
much
as
that
i
am
going
to
work
hard
to
earn
my
bread
and
i
suppose
these
people
are
going
to
do
the
same
always
will
be
some
danger
in
such
society
said
callander
hope
i
may
escape
any
great
evil
hope
so
too
caldigate
you
probably
have
had
a
long
roll
of
ancestors
before
you
all
have
that
back
to
adam
but
i
mean
a
family
roll
of
which
you
ought
to
be
proud
all
ladies
and
gentlemen
my
word
i
do
know
i
hear
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
true
then
she
paused
looking
again
into
his
face
it
was
very
square
and
his
lips
were
hard
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
anger
in
his
eyes
she
wished
herself
back
again
in
her
own
part
of
the
ship
but
she
had
boasted
to
miss
green
that
she
was
not
the
woman
to
give
up
a
duty
when
she
had
undertaken
it
though
she
was
frightened
still
she
must
go
on
hope
you
will
excuse
me
mr
caldigate
am
sure
you
will
not
say
anything
that
i
can
not
excuse
you
think
then
she
paused
she
had
looked
into
his
face
again
and
was
so
little
satisfied
that
she
did
not
dare
to
go
on
he
would
not
help
her
in
the
least
but
stood
there
looking
at
her
with
something
of
a
smile
stealing
over
the
hardness
of
his
face
but
with
such
an
expression
that
the
smile
was
even
worse
than
the
hardness
you
going
to
speak
to
me
about
another
lady
mrs
callander
was
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
speak
of
she
was
anxious
to
remonstrate
against
that
word
lady
but
her
courage
failed
her
do
you
think
that
perhaps
you
had
better
leave
it
alone
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
as
to
myself
i
really
should
care
what
you
said
any
good
advice
would
be
taken
most
gratefully
if
it
did
affect
any
one
else
but
you
might
say
things
of
the
lady
in
question
which
i
should
bear
patiently
ca
be
your
equal
wo
hear
even
that
patiently
you
know
nothing
about
her
except
that
she
is
a
passenger
in
which
matter
she
is
exactly
my
equal
if
you
come
to
that
do
you
think
that
you
are
degrading
yourself
in
coming
here
and
talking
to
me
i
am
not
your
equal
you
are
so
is
she
then
we
sha
arrive
at
anything
callander
and
so
you
had
better
give
it
up
whereupon
she
did
give
it
up
and
retreat
to
her
own
part
of
the
ship
but
not
with
a
very
good
grace
they
had
certainly
become
very
intimate
john
caldigate
and
smith
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
ordinary
language
of
the
world
he
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
he
did
in
fact
know
nothing
about
her
but
what
she
told
herself
and
this
amounted
to
little
more
than
three
statements
which
might
or
might
not
be
true
that
she
had
gone
on
the
stage
in
opposition
to
her
friends
that
she
had
married
an
actor
who
had
treated
her
with
great
cruelty
and
that
he
had
died
of
drink
and
with
each
of
these
stories
there
had
been
an
accompaniment
of
mystery
she
had
not
told
him
her
maiden
name
nor
what
had
been
the
condition
of
her
parents
nor
whether
they
were
living
nor
at
what
theatres
she
and
her
husband
had
acted
nor
when
he
had
died
she
had
expressed
a
hope
that
she
might
get
an
engagement
in
the
colonies
but
she
had
not
spoken
of
any
recommendation
or
letters
of
introduction
he
simply
knew
of
her
that
her
name
was
euphemia
smith
in
that
matter
of
her
clothes
there
had
been
a
great
improvement
but
made
very
gradually
she
had
laughed
at
her
own
precautions
saying
that
in
her
poverty
she
had
wished
to
save
everything
that
could
be
saved
and
that
she
had
only
intended
to
make
herself
look
like
others
in
the
same
class
i
had
wanted
to
avoid
all
attention
at
first
she
said
smiling
as
she
looked
up
at
him
which
you
have
been
altogether
unsuccessful
he
replied
you
are
certainly
more
talked
about
than
any
one
in
the
ship
it
been
my
fault
she
asked
then
he
comforted
her
saying
that
it
certainly
had
not
been
her
fault
that
she
had
been
reticent
and
reserved
till
she
had
been
either
provoked
or
invited
to
come
forth
and
in
fact
that
her
conduct
had
been
in
all
respects
feminine
pretty
and
decorous
as
to
all
which
he
was
not
perhaps
the
best
judge
in
the
world
but
she
was
certainly
much
pleasanter
to
look
at
and
even
to
talk
to
now
that
she
had
put
on
a
small
clean
black
felt
hat
instead
of
the
broken
straw
and
had
got
out
from
her
trunks
a
pretty
warm
shawl
and
placed
a
ribbon
or
two
about
her
in
some
indescribable
manner
and
was
no
longer
ashamed
of
showing
her
shoes
as
she
sat
about
upon
the
deck
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
she
was
seen
now
that
she
was
the
most
attractive
female
on
board
the
ship
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
anger
of
the
cromptons
callanders
and
miss
greens
was
mitigated
by
the
change
the
battle
against
her
became
stronger
and
the
duty
of
rescuing
that
infatuated
young
man
from
her
sorceries
was
more
clear
than
ever
if
only
anything
could
be
done
to
rescue
him
what
could
be
done
smith
could
not
be
locked
up
no
one
not
even
the
captain
could
send
her
down
to
her
own
wretched
little
cabin
because
she
would
talk
with
a
gentleman
talking
is
allowed
on
board
ship
and
even
flirting
to
a
certain
extent
smith
conduct
with
caldigate
was
not
more
peculiar
than
that
of
miss
green
and
the
doctor
only
it
pleased
certain
people
to
think
that
miss
green
might
be
fond
of
the
doctor
if
she
chose
and
that
smith
had
no
right
to
be
fond
of
any
man
there
was
a
stubbornness
about
both
the
sinners
which
resolved
to
set
public
opinion
at
defiance
the
very
fact
that
others
wished
to
interfere
with
him
made
caldigate
determined
to
resent
all
interference
and
the
woman
with
perhaps
a
deeper
insight
into
her
own
advantages
was
brave
enough
to
be
able
to
set
opposition
at
defiance
they
were
about
a
week
from
their
port
when
the
captain
captain
munday
was
induced
to
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
he
was
pressed
to
do
so
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
passengers
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
this
unfortunate
young
man
should
go
on
shore
merely
to
become
the
prey
of
such
a
woman
as
that
so
captain
munday
who
at
heart
was
not
afraid
of
his
passenger
but
who
persisted
in
saying
that
no
good
could
be
done
and
who
had
as
may
be
remembered
already
made
a
slight
attempt
was
induced
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
he
came
up
to
caldigate
on
the
deck
one
afternoon
and
without
any
preface
began
his
business
caldigate
he
said
am
afraid
you
are
getting
into
a
scrape
with
one
of
your
do
you
call
a
scrape
captain
munday
should
call
it
a
scrape
if
a
young
gentleman
of
your
position
and
your
prospects
were
to
find
himself
engaged
on
board
ship
to
marry
a
woman
he
knew
nothing
about
you
know
anything
about
my
position
and
prospects
captain
munday
know
you
are
a
gentleman
i
think
you
know
less
about
the
lady
know
nothing
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
hear
really
would
rather
that
you
did
not
of
course
captain
munday
on
board
your
own
ship
you
are
a
despot
and
i
must
say
that
you
have
made
everything
very
pleasant
for
us
but
i
do
think
even
your
position
entitles
you
to
talk
to
me
about
my
private
affairs
or
about
hers
you
say
you
know
nothing
is
it
manly
to
repeat
what
one
hears
about
a
poor
forlorn
woman
then
the
captain
retreated
without
another
word
owning
to
himself
that
he
was
beaten
if
this
foolish
young
man
chose
to
make
for
himself
a
bed
of
that
kind
he
must
lie
upon
it
captain
munday
went
away
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
spoke
no
further
word
to
john
caldigate
on
that
or
any
other
subject
during
the
voyage
caldigate
had
driven
off
his
persecutors
valiantly
and
had
taught
them
all
to
think
that
he
was
resolute
in
his
purposes
in
regard
to
smith
let
those
purposes
be
what
they
might
but
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
for
he
had
no
purposes
and
was
within
his
own
mind
conscious
of
his
lack
of
all
purpose
and
very
conscious
of
his
folly
and
though
he
could
repel
callander
and
the
captain
as
he
had
always
repelled
those
who
had
attempted
to
control
him
still
he
knew
that
they
had
been
right
such
an
intimacy
as
this
could
not
be
wise
and
its
want
of
wisdom
became
the
more
strongly
impressed
upon
him
the
nearer
he
got
to
shore
and
the
more
he
felt
that
when
he
had
got
ashore
he
should
not
know
how
to
act
in
regard
to
her
the
intimacy
had
certainly
become
very
close
he
had
expressed
his
great
admiration
and
she
had
replied
that
things
not
been
as
they
were
she
could
have
returned
the
feeling
but
she
did
not
say
what
the
things
were
which
might
have
been
otherwise
nor
did
she
seem
to
attempt
to
lead
him
on
to
further
and
more
definite
proposals
and
she
never
spoke
of
any
joint
action
between
them
when
on
shore
though
she
gave
herself
up
to
his
society
here
on
board
the
ship
she
seemed
to
think
that
they
were
then
to
part
as
though
one
would
be
going
one
way
and
one
the
other
but
he
felt
that
after
so
close
an
intimacy
they
could
not
part
like
that
chapter
viii
reaching
melbourne
things
went
on
in
the
same
way
till
the
night
before
the
morning
on
which
they
were
to
enter
hobson
bay
hobson
bay
as
every
one
knows
is
the
inlet
of
the
sea
into
which
the
little
river
runs
on
which
melbourne
is
built
after
leaving
the
tropics
they
had
gone
down
south
and
had
encountered
showers
and
wind
and
cold
weather
but
now
they
had
come
up
again
into
warm
latitudes
and
fine
autumn
weather
for
it
was
the
beginning
of
march
and
the
world
out
there
is
upside
down
before
that
evening
nothing
had
been
said
between
smith
and
john
caldigate
as
to
any
future
not
a
word
to
indicate
that
when
the
journey
should
be
over
there
would
or
that
there
would
not
be
further
intercourse
between
them
she
had
purposely
avoided
any
reference
to
a
world
after
this
world
of
the
ship
even
refusing
in
her
but
manner
to
discuss
matters
so
far
ahead
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
leave
her
on
board
as
he
would
the
other
passengers
without
a
word
spoken
as
to
some
future
meeting
there
will
arrive
on
occasions
a
certain
pitch
of
intimacy
which
can
not
be
defined
as
may
a
degree
of
cousinship
but
which
is
perfectly
understood
by
the
persons
concerned
so
close
as
to
forbid
such
mere
shaking
of
the
hands
there
are
many
men
and
perhaps
more
women
cautious
enough
and
wise
enough
to
think
of
this
beforehand
and
thinking
of
it
to
guard
themselves
from
the
dangerous
attractions
of
casual
companions
by
a
composed
manner
and
unenthusiastic
conversation
who
does
not
know
the
sagacious
lady
who
after
sitting
at
table
with
the
same
gentleman
for
a
month
can
say
jones
just
as
though
jones
had
been
a
stranger
under
her
notice
but
for
a
day
but
others
gush
out
and
when
jones
takes
his
departure
hardly
know
how
not
to
throw
themselves
into
his
arms
the
intercourse
between
our
hero
and
smith
had
been
such
that
as
a
gentleman
he
could
not
leave
her
without
some
allusion
to
future
meetings
that
was
all
up
to
the
evening
before
their
arrival
the
whole
ship
company
captain
officers
passengers
and
all
were
quite
sure
that
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
a
promise
of
marriage
from
him
but
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
kind
among
others
dick
shand
was
sure
that
there
was
some
entanglement
entanglement
was
the
word
he
always
used
in
discussing
the
matter
with
callander
between
dick
and
his
friend
there
had
been
very
little
confidential
communication
of
late
caldigate
had
forbidden
shand
to
talk
to
him
about
smith
and
thus
had
naturally
closed
the
mouth
on
other
matters
and
then
they
had
fallen
into
different
sets
dick
at
least
had
fallen
into
a
set
while
caldigate
had
hardly
associated
with
any
but
the
one
dangerous
friend
dick
had
lived
much
with
a
bevy
of
noisy
young
men
who
had
been
given
to
games
and
smoking
and
to
a
good
deal
of
drink
caldigate
had
said
not
a
word
even
when
on
one
occasion
dick
had
stumbled
down
into
the
cabin
very
much
the
worse
for
what
he
had
taken
how
could
he
find
fault
with
dick
folly
when
he
would
not
allow
dick
to
say
a
word
to
him
as
to
his
own
but
on
this
last
day
at
sea
it
became
necessary
that
they
should
understand
each
other
do
you
mean
to
do
when
you
land
caldigate
asked
all
that
had
been
settled
between
them
very
exactly
long
since
at
a
town
called
nobble
about
three
hundred
miles
west
of
sydney
there
lived
a
man
supposed
to
be
knowing
in
gold
named
crinkett
with
whom
they
had
corresponded
and
to
whom
they
intended
in
the
first
instance
to
apply
and
about
twenty
miles
beyond
nobble
were
the
new
and
now
much
reputed
ahalala
diggings
at
which
they
purposed
to
make
their
first
debut
it
had
been
decided
that
they
would
go
direct
from
melbourne
to
nobble
not
round
by
sydney
so
as
to
see
more
of
the
world
and
thus
spend
more
money
but
by
the
direct
route
taking
the
railway
to
albury
and
the
coaches
which
they
were
informed
were
running
between
albury
and
nobble
and
it
had
also
been
determined
that
they
would
spend
but
two
nights
in
melbourne
to
get
their
things
washed
so
keen
had
they
been
in
their
determination
to
begin
their
work
but
on
all
these
matters
there
had
been
no
discussion
now
for
a
month
nor
even
an
allusion
to
them
do
you
mean
to
do
when
we
land
caldigate
asked
on
that
last
day
thought
all
that
was
settled
but
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
change
everything
am
going
to
change
nothing
only
you
seem
to
have
got
into
such
a
way
of
life
that
i
did
know
whether
you
would
be
prepared
for
serious
work
shall
be
as
well
prepared
as
you
are
i
do
doubt
said
dick
have
no
impediment
of
any
kind
certainly
have
none
then
we
will
start
by
the
first
train
on
wednesday
morning
for
albury
we
must
have
our
heavy
things
sent
round
by
sea
to
sydney
and
get
them
from
there
as
best
we
can
when
we
are
a
little
fixed
one
of
us
can
run
down
to
sydney
and
so
it
was
settled
without
any
real
confidence
between
them
but
in
conformity
with
their
previous
arrangements
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
after
they
had
sighted
cape
otway
that
smith
and
caldigate
began
their
last
conversation
on
board
the
goldfinder
a
conversation
which
lasted
with
one
or
two
interruptions
late
into
the
night
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
it
she
said
the
end
of
what
the
end
of
all
that
is
pleasant
and
easy
and
safe
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
how
i
dreaded
the
finish
here
i
have
been
fairly
comfortable
and
have
in
many
respects
enjoyed
it
i
have
had
you
to
talk
to
and
there
has
been
a
flavour
of
old
days
about
it
what
shall
i
be
doing
this
time
do
know
your
plans
and
i
have
not
told
you
because
i
would
not
have
you
bothered
with
me
when
i
land
you
have
enough
on
your
own
hands
and
if
i
were
to
be
a
burden
to
you
now
it
might
be
a
serious
trouble
i
am
afraid
poor
shand
objects
to
me
do
think
that
would
stand
in
my
way
stands
in
mine
of
course
with
your
pride
and
your
obstinacy
you
would
tell
shand
to
go
to
the
devil
if
he
ventured
to
object
to
any
little
delay
that
might
be
occasioned
by
looking
after
me
then
shand
would
go
there
or
elsewhere
and
all
your
plans
would
be
broken
up
and
you
would
be
without
a
companion
i
had
you
of
all
the
words
which
he
could
have
spoken
in
such
an
emergency
these
were
the
most
foolish
and
yet
at
so
tender
a
moment
how
were
they
to
be
repressed
do
think
that
dick
shand
is
dangerous
she
answered
laughing
i
should
be
worse
i
am
afraid
dick
shand
will
drink
so
we
must
part
and
what
would
you
do
would
i
do
what
could
i
do
then
there
was
a
pause
i
should
want
you
to
marry
me
which
would
be
worse
than
dick
drinking
eh
there
is
an
obligation
on
a
man
to
persevere
when
a
woman
has
encouraged
him
in
it
is
like
riding
at
a
fence
when
once
you
have
set
your
horse
at
it
you
must
go
on
however
impracticable
it
may
appear
as
you
draw
close
to
it
if
you
have
never
looked
at
the
fence
at
all
if
you
have
ridden
quite
the
other
way
making
for
some
safe
gate
or
clinging
to
the
dull
lane
then
there
will
be
no
excitement
but
also
there
will
be
no
danger
and
no
disgrace
caldigate
had
ridden
hard
at
the
fence
and
could
not
crane
at
it
now
that
it
was
so
close
to
him
he
could
only
trust
to
his
good
fortune
to
carry
him
safe
over
suppose
you
would
want
it
he
said
i
might
would
want
me
but
you
would
not
want
me
for
always
i
should
be
a
burden
less
easy
to
shake
off
than
dick
shand
that
the
way
a
man
is
always
to
look
at
a
woman
is
the
way
in
which
they
do
i
think
i
often
wonder
that
any
man
is
ever
fool
enough
to
marry
a
poor
man
may
want
some
one
to
serve
him
and
may
be
able
to
get
service
in
no
other
way
or
a
man
poor
in
another
way
may
find
an
heiress
convenient
but
otherwise
i
think
men
only
marry
when
they
are
caught
women
are
prehensile
things
which
have
to
cling
to
something
for
nourishment
and
support
when
i
come
across
such
a
one
as
you
i
naturally
put
out
my
feelers
have
not
been
aware
of
it
you
are
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
your
mind
is
vacillating
about
me
i
am
sure
you
like
me
i
like
you
you
know
that
i
love
you
did
not
know
it
you
did
you
are
not
the
man
to
be
diffident
of
yourself
in
such
a
matter
you
must
either
think
that
i
love
you
or
that
i
have
been
a
great
hypocrite
in
pretending
to
do
so
love
you
they
were
sitting
together
on
a
large
spar
which
was
lashed
on
to
the
deck
and
which
had
served
throughout
all
the
voyage
for
a
seat
for
passengers
there
were
others
now
on
the
farther
end
of
it
but
there
was
a
feeling
that
when
caldigate
and
smith
were
together
it
would
not
be
civil
to
intrude
upon
their
privacy
at
this
time
it
was
dark
but
their
eyes
had
become
used
to
the
gloom
and
each
could
see
the
other
face
you
she
repeated
looking
up
at
him
speaking
in
a
very
low
voice
but
yet
oh
so
clearly
so
that
not
a
fraction
of
a
sound
was
lost
to
his
ears
with
no
special
emotion
in
her
face
with
no
contortion
no
grimace
but
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
should
it
be
possible
that
i
should
not
love
you
for
two
months
we
have
been
together
as
people
seldom
are
in
the
world
as
they
never
can
be
without
hating
each
other
or
loving
each
other
thoroughly
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
who
am
all
alone
and
desolate
and
you
are
clever
educated
and
a
man
how
should
i
not
love
you
and
i
know
from
the
touch
of
your
hand
from
your
breath
when
i
feel
it
on
my
face
from
the
fire
of
your
eye
and
from
the
tenderness
of
your
mouth
that
you
too
love
me
do
he
said
as
there
may
be
marriage
without
love
so
there
may
be
love
without
marriage
you
can
not
but
feel
how
little
you
know
of
me
and
ignorant
as
you
are
of
so
much
that
to
marry
me
might
be
ruin
it
was
just
what
he
had
told
himself
over
and
over
again
when
he
had
been
trying
to
resolve
what
he
would
do
in
regard
to
her
you
know
that
know
that
it
might
have
been
so
among
the
connections
of
home
life
to
you
the
connections
of
home
life
may
all
come
back
that
woman
talked
about
your
roll
of
ancestors
coming
from
her
it
was
absurd
but
there
was
some
truth
in
it
you
know
that
were
you
to
marry
me
say
in
melbourne
it
would
shut
you
out
from
well
not
the
possibility
but
the
probability
of
return
do
not
want
to
go
back
do
i
want
to
hinder
you
from
doing
so
if
we
were
alike
desolate
alike
alone
alike
cast
out
oh
then
what
a
heaven
of
happiness
i
should
think
had
been
opened
to
me
by
the
idea
of
joining
myself
to
you
there
is
nothing
i
could
not
do
for
you
but
i
will
not
be
a
millstone
round
your
neck
she
had
taken
so
much
the
more
prominent
part
in
all
this
that
he
felt
himself
compelled
by
his
manliness
to
say
something
in
contradiction
to
it
something
that
should
have
the
same
flavour
about
it
as
had
her
and
declared
passion
he
also
must
be
unselfish
and
enthusiastic
do
not
deny
that
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
is
true
course
i
love
you
ought
to
be
of
course
now
of
course
i
do
not
mean
to
part
from
you
now
as
though
we
were
never
to
see
each
other
again
hope
not
quite
that
not
i
shall
therefore
hold
you
as
engaged
to
me
and
myself
as
engaged
to
you
unless
something
should
occur
to
separate
us
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
say
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
speak
without
being
foolish
it
is
not
usual
that
a
gentleman
should
ask
a
lady
to
be
engaged
to
him
unless
something
should
occur
to
separate
them
will
consent
to
that
he
said
i
will
consent
to
is
this
that
i
will
be
yours
all
yours
whenever
you
may
choose
to
send
for
me
at
any
moment
i
will
be
your
wife
for
the
asking
but
you
shall
go
away
first
and
shall
think
of
it
and
reflect
upon
it
so
that
i
may
not
have
to
reproach
myself
with
having
caught
you
me
yes
caught
you
i
do
feel
that
i
have
caught
you
almost
i
do
feel
almost
that
i
ought
to
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
from
the
beginning
of
it
all
i
knew
that
i
ought
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
you
are
too
good
for
me
then
she
rose
from
her
place
as
though
to
leave
him
will
go
down
now
she
said
i
know
you
will
have
many
things
to
do
when
we
get
up
we
shall
be
in
the
harbour
and
you
will
be
on
shore
quite
early
there
will
be
no
time
for
a
word
of
farewell
then
i
will
meet
you
again
here
just
before
we
go
to
bed
say
at
ten
then
we
will
arrange
if
we
can
arrange
how
we
may
meet
again
and
so
she
glided
away
from
him
and
he
was
left
alone
sitting
on
the
spar
now
at
any
rate
he
had
engaged
himself
there
could
not
be
any
doubt
about
that
he
certainly
could
not
be
justified
in
regarding
himself
as
free
because
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
give
him
time
to
think
of
it
of
course
he
was
engaged
to
marry
her
when
a
man
has
been
successful
in
his
wooing
he
is
supposed
to
be
happy
he
asked
himself
whether
he
was
proud
of
the
result
of
this
intimacy
she
had
told
him
she
herself
that
she
had
him
meaning
thereby
that
he
had
been
taken
as
a
rabbit
with
a
snare
or
a
fish
with
a
baited
hook
if
it
had
been
so
surely
she
would
not
herself
have
said
so
and
yet
he
was
aware
how
common
it
is
for
a
delinquent
to
cover
his
own
delinquency
by
declaring
it
course
i
am
idle
says
the
idle
one
escaping
the
disgrace
of
his
idleness
by
his
honesty
have
caught
you
there
is
something
soothing
to
the
vanity
in
such
a
declaration
from
a
pretty
woman
that
she
should
have
wished
to
catch
you
is
something
something
that
the
net
should
itself
be
so
pleasant
with
its
silken
meshes
but
the
declaration
may
not
the
less
be
true
and
the
fact
unpleasant
in
the
matter
of
matrimony
a
man
does
not
wish
to
be
caught
and
caldigate
fond
as
he
was
of
her
acknowledged
that
what
she
said
was
true
he
leant
back
in
a
corner
that
was
made
by
the
hatchway
and
endeavoured
to
think
over
his
life
and
prospects
if
this
were
a
true
engagement
then
must
he
cease
altogether
to
think
of
hester
bolton
then
must
that
dream
be
abandoned
it
is
of
no
use
to
the
most
fervid
imagination
to
have
a
castle
projected
in
spain
from
which
all
possible
foundation
has
been
taken
away
in
his
dreams
of
life
a
man
should
never
dream
that
which
is
altogether
impossible
there
had
been
something
in
the
thought
of
hester
bolton
which
had
taken
him
back
from
the
roughnesses
of
his
new
life
from
the
doubtful
respectability
of
smith
from
the
squalor
of
the
from
the
snores
of
dick
shand
to
a
sweeter
brighter
cleaner
world
till
this
engagement
had
been
absolutely
spoken
he
could
still
indulge
in
that
romance
distant
and
unreal
as
it
was
but
now
now
it
seemed
to
be
brought
in
upon
him
very
forcibly
that
he
must
rid
his
thoughts
of
hester
bolton
or
else
rid
his
life
of
smith
but
he
was
engaged
to
marry
smith
then
he
got
up
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
deck
asking
himself
whether
this
could
really
be
the
truth
was
he
bound
to
this
woman
for
his
life
and
if
so
had
he
done
a
thing
of
which
he
already
repented
himself
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
she
was
admirably
fitted
for
the
life
which
he
was
fated
to
lead
she
was
handsome
intellectual
a
most
delightful
companion
and
yet
capable
of
enduring
the
hardships
of
an
adventurous
uncertain
career
ought
he
not
to
think
himself
peculiarly
lucky
in
having
found
for
himself
so
eligible
a
companion
but
there
is
something
so
solemn
so
sacred
in
the
name
of
wife
a
man
brought
up
among
soft
things
is
so
imbued
with
the
feeling
that
his
wife
should
be
something
better
cleaner
sweeter
holier
than
himself
that
he
could
not
but
be
when
he
thought
that
he
was
bound
to
marry
this
all
but
nameless
widow
of
some
drunken
player
this
woman
who
among
other
women
had
been
thought
unfit
for
all
companionship
but
things
arrange
themselves
how
probable
it
was
that
he
would
never
be
married
to
her
after
all
this
might
be
but
an
incident
and
not
an
unpleasant
incident
in
his
life
he
had
had
his
amusement
out
of
it
and
she
had
had
hers
perhaps
they
would
part
to
meet
no
more
but
when
he
thought
that
there
might
be
comfort
in
this
direction
he
felt
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
for
thinking
so
this
is
to
say
was
thus
she
greeted
him
again
that
night
my
love
love
my
love
and
now
remember
this
my
address
will
be
melbourne
it
will
be
for
you
to
write
to
me
you
will
not
hear
from
me
unless
you
do
indeed
i
shall
know
nothing
of
you
let
me
have
a
line
before
a
month
is
over
this
he
promised
and
then
they
parted
at
break
of
day
on
the
following
morning
the
goldfinder
rode
over
the
rip
into
hobson
bay
there
were
still
four
hours
before
the
ship
lay
at
her
moorings
but
during
all
that
time
smith
was
not
seen
by
caldigate
as
he
got
into
the
boat
which
took
him
and
shand
from
the
ship
to
the
pier
at
sandridge
she
kissed
her
hand
to
him
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
before
eleven
dick
shand
and
his
companion
were
comfortably
put
up
at
the
miners
home
in
flinders
lane
chapter
ix
nobble
during
the
two
days
which
dick
and
caldigate
spent
together
in
melbourne
smith
name
was
not
mentioned
between
them
they
were
particularly
civil
each
to
the
other
and
went
to
work
together
making
arrangements
at
a
bank
as
to
their
money
taking
their
places
despatching
their
luggage
and
sorting
their
belongings
as
though
there
had
been
no
such
woman
as
smith
on
board
the
goldfinder
dick
though
he
had
been
inclined
to
grumble
when
his
mystery
had
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
who
had
of
course
been
jealous
when
he
saw
that
the
lady
had
discarded
her
old
hat
and
put
on
new
ribbons
not
for
him
but
for
another
was
too
conscious
of
the
desolation
to
which
he
would
be
subjected
by
quarrelling
with
his
friend
he
felt
himself
unable
to
go
alone
and
was
therefore
willing
that
the
bygones
of
the
ship
should
be
bygones
caldigate
on
the
other
hand
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
owed
some
reparation
to
his
companion
of
course
he
had
not
bound
himself
to
any
special
mode
of
life
but
had
he
in
his
present
condition
allied
himself
more
closely
to
smith
he
would
to
some
extent
have
thrown
dick
over
and
then
as
soon
as
he
was
on
shore
he
did
feel
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
in
regard
to
smith
was
it
not
manifest
that
any
closer
alliance
let
the
alliance
be
what
it
might
must
be
ruinous
to
him
as
it
was
had
he
not
made
an
absolute
fool
of
himself
with
smith
had
he
not
got
himself
already
into
a
mess
from
which
there
was
no
escape
of
course
he
must
write
to
her
when
the
month
was
over
the
very
weight
of
his
thoughts
on
this
matter
made
him
tamer
with
dick
and
more
observant
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been
they
were
during
those
two
days
frequently
about
the
town
looking
at
the
various
streets
and
buildings
at
the
banks
and
churches
and
gardens
as
is
usual
with
young
men
when
they
visit
a
new
town
but
during
it
all
caldigate
mind
was
more
intent
on
smith
than
he
was
on
the
sights
of
the
place
melbourne
is
not
so
big
but
that
she
might
easily
have
thrown
herself
in
his
way
had
she
pleased
strangers
residing
in
such
a
town
are
almost
sure
to
see
each
other
before
hours
are
gone
but
smith
was
not
seen
two
or
three
times
he
went
up
and
down
collins
street
alone
without
his
friend
not
wishing
to
see
her
aware
that
he
had
better
not
see
her
but
made
restless
by
a
nervous
feeling
that
he
ought
to
wish
to
see
her
that
he
should
at
any
rate
not
keep
out
of
her
way
but
smith
did
not
show
herself
whatever
might
be
her
future
views
she
did
not
now
take
steps
to
present
herself
to
him
shall
be
so
much
the
more
bound
to
present
myself
to
her
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
she
knows
all
that
he
added
in
the
same
soliloquy
on
the
wednesday
morning
they
left
melbourne
by
the
train
for
albury
which
latter
place
they
reached
the
same
day
about
having
then
crossed
the
murray
river
and
passed
into
the
colony
of
new
south
wales
here
they
stayed
but
a
few
hours
and
then
went
on
by
coach
on
their
journey
to
nobble
from
one
wretched
vehicle
they
were
handed
on
to
another
never
stopping
anywhere
long
enough
to
go
to
bed
three
hours
at
one
wretched
place
and
five
at
another
travelling
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
bumping
through
the
mud
and
slush
of
the
bush
roads
and
still
going
on
for
three
days
and
three
nights
this
was
roughing
it
indeed
even
dick
complained
and
said
that
of
all
the
torments
prepared
for
wicked
mortals
on
earth
this
australian
coaching
was
the
worst
they
went
through
and
murrumburra
and
other
places
with
similar
names
till
at
last
they
were
told
that
they
had
reached
nobble
nobble
they
thought
was
the
foulest
place
which
they
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
town
as
such
places
are
called
and
had
been
built
with
great
rapidity
to
supply
the
necessities
of
adjacent
miners
it
was
constructed
altogether
of
wood
but
no
two
houses
had
been
constructed
alike
they
generally
had
gable
ends
opening
on
to
the
street
but
were
so
different
in
breadth
altitude
and
form
that
it
was
easy
to
see
that
each
enterprising
proprietor
had
been
his
own
architect
but
they
were
all
alike
in
having
enormous
some
high
some
broad
some
sloping
on
which
were
declared
the
merits
of
the
tradesmen
who
administered
within
to
the
wants
of
mining
humanity
and
they
had
generally
assumed
most
singular
names
for
themselves
old
soft
goods
store
polyeuka
stout
depot
nine
flour
mills
and
so
on
all
of
which
were
very
unintelligible
to
our
friends
till
they
learned
that
these
were
the
names
belonging
to
certain
claims
which
had
been
opened
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nobble
the
street
itself
was
almost
more
perilous
to
vehicles
than
the
slush
of
the
so
deep
were
the
holes
and
so
uncertain
the
surface
when
caldigate
informed
the
driver
that
they
wanted
to
be
taken
as
far
as
henniker
hotel
the
man
said
that
he
had
given
up
going
so
far
as
that
for
the
last
two
months
the
journey
being
too
perilous
so
they
shouldered
their
portmanteaus
and
struggled
forth
down
the
street
here
and
there
a
short
bit
of
wooden
causeway
perhaps
for
the
length
of
three
houses
would
assist
them
and
then
again
they
would
have
to
descend
into
the
roadway
and
plunge
along
through
the
mud
is
not
quite
as
nice
walking
as
the
old
quad
at
trinity
said
caldigate
is
the
beastliest
hole
i
ever
put
my
foot
in
since
i
was
born
said
dick
who
had
just
stumbled
and
nearly
came
to
the
ground
with
his
burden
told
us
that
nobble
was
a
fine
town
henniker
hotel
was
a
long
low
wooden
shanty
divided
into
various
very
small
partitions
by
thin
planks
in
most
of
which
two
or
more
beds
had
been
packed
very
closely
but
between
these
little
compartments
there
was
a
long
chamber
containing
a
long
and
very
dirty
table
and
two
long
benches
here
were
sitting
a
crowd
of
miners
drinking
when
our
friends
were
ushered
in
through
the
bar
or
counter
which
faced
to
the
street
at
the
bar
they
were
received
by
a
dirty
old
woman
who
said
that
she
was
henniker
then
they
were
told
while
the
convivial
crowd
were
looking
on
and
listening
that
they
could
have
the
use
of
one
of
the
partitions
and
their
for
each
when
they
asked
for
a
partition
apiece
they
were
told
that
if
they
did
like
what
was
offered
to
them
they
might
go
elsewhere
upon
that
they
agreed
to
henniker
terms
and
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
benches
looked
desolately
into
each
others
faces
yes
it
was
different
from
trinity
college
different
from
babington
very
different
even
from
the
less
luxurious
comfort
of
the
house
at
pollington
the
deck
even
the
cabin
of
the
goldfinder
had
been
better
than
this
and
then
they
had
no
friend
not
even
an
acquaintance
within
some
hundred
miles
the
men
around
them
were
not
uncivil
australian
miners
never
are
so
but
they
were
inquisitive
familiar
and
with
their
almost
repulsive
it
was
about
noon
when
our
friends
reached
henniker
and
they
were
told
that
there
would
be
dinner
at
one
there
was
always
at
one
and
at
seven
and
at
eight
in
the
morning
so
one
of
the
men
informed
them
the
same
gentleman
hoped
that
the
strangers
were
not
very
particular
as
the
though
plentiful
was
apt
to
be
rough
of
its
kind
have
it
a
deal
worse
before
you
done
if
you
going
on
to
ahalala
said
another
then
caldigate
said
that
they
did
intend
to
go
on
to
ahalala
going
to
have
a
spell
at
said
he
what
was
the
use
of
making
any
secret
of
the
matter
knowed
that
ready
enough
said
one
of
the
men
like
you
do
come
much
to
nobble
for
nothing
else
have
you
got
any
money
to
start
with
few
said
dick
cautiously
do
go
very
far
here
my
mate
if
you
can
spend
four
or
five
pounds
each
for
the
next
month
so
as
to
get
help
till
you
know
where
you
are
it
may
be
you
turn
up
gold
at
ahalala
but
if
not
you
better
go
elsewhere
you
need
be
afraid
we
ai
to
rob
you
of
nothing
yet
we
do
want
nothing
to
drink
said
another
for
yourself
jack
said
a
third
come
as
these
are
regular
new
chums
i
do
care
if
i
shout
for
the
lot
myself
then
the
dirty
old
woman
was
summoned
and
everybody
had
whisky
all
round
when
that
was
done
another
generous
man
came
to
the
front
and
there
was
more
whisky
till
caldigate
was
frightened
as
to
the
result
evil
might
have
come
from
it
had
not
the
old
woman
opportunely
brought
the
into
the
room
this
she
chucked
down
on
the
table
in
such
a
way
that
the
grease
out
of
the
dish
spattered
itself
all
around
there
was
no
tablecloth
nor
had
any
preparation
been
made
but
in
the
middle
of
the
table
there
was
a
heap
of
dirty
knives
and
forks
with
which
the
men
at
once
armed
themselves
and
each
took
a
plate
out
of
a
heap
that
had
been
placed
on
a
shelf
against
the
wall
caldigate
and
shand
when
they
saw
how
the
matter
was
to
be
arranged
did
as
the
other
men
the
consisted
of
an
enormous
lump
of
boiled
beef
and
a
bowl
of
potatoes
which
was
moderate
enough
in
size
considering
that
there
were
in
all
about
a
dozen
men
to
be
fed
but
there
was
meat
enough
for
double
the
number
and
bread
in
plenty
but
so
as
to
be
rejected
by
most
of
the
men
the
potatoes
were
evidently
the
luxury
and
guided
by
that
feeling
the
man
who
had
told
the
strangers
that
they
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
robbed
at
once
selected
six
out
of
the
bowl
and
deposited
three
each
before
dick
and
caldigate
he
helped
the
others
all
round
to
one
each
and
then
was
left
without
any
for
himself
do
care
a
damn
for
that
sort
of
tucker
he
said
as
though
he
despised
potatoes
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
of
all
the
crew
he
was
the
dirtiest
and
was
certainly
half
drunk
another
man
holloaed
to
henniker
for
pickles
but
mother
henniker
without
leaving
her
seat
at
the
bar
told
them
to
themselves
whereupon
one
of
the
party
making
some
allusion
to
jack
brien
swag
jack
brien
being
absent
at
the
moment
rose
from
his
seat
and
undid
a
great
roll
lying
in
one
of
the
corners
every
miner
has
his
swag
consisting
of
a
large
blanket
which
is
rolled
up
and
contains
all
his
personal
luggage
out
of
jack
brien
swag
were
extracted
two
large
square
bottles
of
pickles
these
were
straightway
divided
among
the
men
care
being
taken
that
dick
and
caldigate
should
have
ample
shares
then
every
man
helped
himself
to
beef
as
much
as
he
would
passing
the
dish
round
from
one
to
the
other
when
the
meal
was
half
finished
henniker
brought
in
an
enormous
jorum
of
tea
which
she
served
out
to
all
the
guests
in
tin
pannikins
giving
to
every
man
a
fixed
and
ample
allowance
of
brown
sugar
without
at
all
consulting
his
taste
milk
there
was
none
in
the
midst
of
this
jack
brien
came
in
and
with
a
clamour
of
mirth
the
empty
pickle
jars
were
shown
him
jack
who
was
a
silent
man
and
somewhat
melancholy
merely
shook
his
head
and
ate
his
beef
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
was
fond
of
pickles
having
taken
so
much
trouble
to
provide
them
but
he
said
not
a
word
of
the
injury
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
to
ahalala
jack
said
the
distributor
of
the
potatoes
nodding
his
head
to
indicate
the
two
new
adventurers
they
to
the
most
infernal
mean
place
as
god
almighty
ever
put
on
this
for
the
perplexment
of
poor
unfortunate
miners
this
was
jack
eloquence
and
his
description
of
ahalala
before
this
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
nor
did
he
speak
again
till
he
had
consumed
three
or
four
pounds
of
beef
and
had
swallowed
two
pannikins
of
tea
then
he
repeated
his
speech
is
so
an
infernal
mean
a
place
as
ahalala
not
nowhere
no
not
nowhere
and
so
them
find
for
theirselves
if
they
go
there
then
his
neighbour
whispered
into
caldigate
ear
that
jack
had
gone
to
ahalala
with
fifty
sovereigns
in
his
pocket
and
that
he
was
now
worth
a
red
cent
there
is
gold
there
asked
caldigate
my
belief
there
gold
pretty
much
everywhere
and
you
may
find
it
or
you
may
that
where
it
is
and
the
are
a
deal
oftener
turning
up
than
the
mays
man
can
get
work
for
wages
suggested
dick
what
the
use
of
that
a
man
as
knows
mining
can
earn
wages
but
ahalala
aint
a
place
for
wages
if
you
want
wages
go
to
one
of
the
places
bendigo
or
the
like
of
that
i
worked
for
wages
but
what
comes
of
it
a
man
goes
to
ahalala
because
he
wants
to
run
his
chance
and
get
a
big
haul
it
every
one
on
his
own
bottom
pretty
much
at
ahalala
be
said
jack
brien
rising
from
the
seat
and
hitching
up
his
trousers
as
he
left
the
room
it
was
very
evident
that
jack
brien
was
a
gambler
after
dinner
there
was
a
smoke
and
after
the
smoke
dick
shand
for
the
company
dick
had
quite
learned
by
this
time
the
mystery
of
shouting
when
one
man
drinks
all
round
he
shouts
and
then
it
is
no
more
than
reciprocal
that
another
man
should
do
the
same
and
in
this
way
when
the
reciprocal
feeling
is
spread
over
a
good
many
drinkers
a
good
deal
of
liquor
is
consumed
while
dick
shand
was
being
consumed
caldigate
asked
one
of
his
new
friends
where
crinkett
lived
was
crinkett
known
in
nobble
it
seemed
that
crinkett
was
very
well
known
in
nobble
indeed
if
anybody
had
done
well
at
nobble
crinkett
had
done
well
he
was
the
of
the
place
this
informant
did
not
think
that
crinkett
had
himself
gone
very
deep
at
ahalala
crinkett
had
risen
high
enough
in
his
profession
to
be
able
to
achieve
more
certainty
than
could
be
found
at
such
a
place
as
ahalala
by
this
time
they
were
on
the
road
to
crinkett
house
this
new
friend
having
undertaken
to
show
them
the
way
can
put
you
up
to
a
thing
or
two
if
he
likes
said
the
new
friend
he
a
pal
of
yourn
caldigate
explained
that
he
had
never
seen
crinkett
but
that
he
had
come
to
nobble
armed
with
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
in
england
who
had
once
been
concerned
in
a
civil
enough
gent
is
crinkett
said
the
miner
he
do
like
making
money
they
say
of
him
there
nothing
he
sell
not
even
his
grandmother
bones
i
like
trade
myself
added
the
miner
some
of
too
sharp
that
where
crinkett
lives
he
a
swell
ai
he
they
had
walked
about
half
a
mile
from
the
town
turning
down
a
lane
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
had
made
their
way
through
yawning
and
heaps
of
dirt
and
pools
of
yellow
water
where
everything
was
disorderly
and
apparently
deserted
till
they
came
to
a
cluster
of
heaps
so
large
as
to
look
like
little
hills
and
here
there
were
signs
of
mining
vitality
on
their
way
they
had
not
come
across
a
single
shred
of
vegetation
though
here
and
there
stood
the
bare
trunks
of
a
few
dead
and
headless
trees
the
ghosts
of
the
forest
which
had
occupied
the
place
six
or
seven
years
previously
on
the
tops
of
these
artificial
hills
there
were
sundry
erections
and
around
them
were
troughs
and
sheds
and
rude
these
as
the
miner
explained
were
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
the
claim
which
was
now
giving
two
ounces
of
gold
to
the
ton
of
quartz
and
which
was
at
present
the
exclusive
property
of
crinkett
who
had
bought
out
the
tribute
shareholders
and
was
working
the
thing
altogether
on
his
own
bottom
as
they
ascended
one
of
those
mounds
of
upcast
stones
and
rubble
they
could
see
on
the
other
side
the
and
the
and
could
hear
the
thud
thud
thud
of
the
great
iron
hammers
as
they
fell
on
the
quartz
and
then
close
beyond
but
still
among
the
hillocks
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
dirt
and
filth
of
the
mining
operations
was
mansion
there
his
very
self
at
the
gate
how
many
times
the
hammer
falls
a
minute
and
how
much
gold
is
from
every
blow
as
it
falls
with
this
little
observation
as
to
crinkett
personal
character
the
miner
made
his
way
back
to
his
companions
chapter
x
polyeuka
hall
the
house
which
they
saw
certainly
surprised
them
much
and
seemed
to
justify
the
assertion
just
before
made
to
them
that
crinkett
was
a
swell
it
was
marvellous
that
any
man
should
have
contemplated
the
building
of
such
a
mansion
in
a
place
so
little
attractive
with
so
many
houses
within
view
the
house
and
little
attempted
garden
together
with
the
stables
and
appurtenances
may
have
occupied
half
an
acre
all
around
it
were
those
hideous
signs
of
mining
operations
which
make
a
country
rich
in
metals
look
as
though
the
devil
had
walked
over
it
dragging
behind
him
an
enormous
rake
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
to
be
seen
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
stood
those
skeletons
of
trees
in
all
spots
where
the
soil
had
not
been
turned
up
but
on
none
of
them
was
there
a
leaf
left
or
even
a
branch
everywhere
the
ground
was
thrown
about
in
hideous
uncovered
hillocks
all
of
which
seemed
to
have
been
deserted
except
those
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
crinkett
house
but
close
around
him
one
could
see
wheels
turning
and
long
ropes
moving
and
water
running
in
little
wooden
conduits
all
of
which
were
signs
of
the
activity
going
on
under
ground
and
then
there
was
the
thud
thud
thud
of
the
which
from
twelve
on
sunday
night
to
twelve
on
saturday
night
never
paused
for
a
moment
having
the
effect
on
that
vacant
day
of
creating
a
painful
strain
of
silence
upon
the
ears
of
those
who
were
compelled
to
remain
on
the
spot
during
the
unoccupied
time
it
was
said
that
in
crinkett
mansion
every
sleeper
would
wake
from
his
sleep
as
soon
as
the
engine
was
stopped
disturbed
by
the
unwonted
quiescence
but
the
house
which
had
been
built
in
this
unpromising
spot
was
quite
entitled
to
be
called
a
mansion
it
was
of
red
brick
three
storeys
high
with
white
stone
facings
to
all
the
windows
and
all
the
corners
which
glittered
uncomfortably
in
the
hot
sun
there
was
a
sweep
up
to
it
the
road
having
been
made
from
the
débris
of
the
stone
out
of
which
the
gold
had
been
crushed
but
though
there
was
the
sweep
up
to
the
door
carefully
made
for
the
length
of
a
few
dozen
yards
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
called
a
road
outside
though
there
were
tracks
here
and
there
through
the
hillocks
along
which
the
waggons
employed
about
the
place
struggled
through
the
mud
the
house
itself
was
built
with
a
large
hall
in
the
middle
and
three
large
windows
on
each
side
on
the
floor
there
were
four
large
rooms
with
kitchens
opening
out
behind
and
above
there
were
of
course
chambers
in
proportion
and
in
the
little
garden
there
was
a
pond
and
a
big
and
there
were
and
stables
so
that
it
was
quite
a
mansion
it
was
called
polyeuka
hall
because
while
it
was
being
built
crinkett
was
drawing
large
gains
from
the
polyeuka
mine
about
three
miles
distant
on
the
other
side
of
nobble
for
the
building
of
his
mansion
on
this
special
site
no
one
could
imagine
any
other
reason
than
that
love
which
a
brave
man
has
of
overcoming
difficulties
to
endeavour
to
create
a
paradise
in
such
a
pandemonium
required
all
the
energies
of
a
crinkett
whether
or
not
he
had
been
successful
depended
of
course
on
his
own
idiosyncrasies
he
had
a
wife
who
it
is
to
be
hoped
liked
her
residence
they
had
no
children
and
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
in
other
mining
districts
in
which
he
had
ventures
when
thus
absent
he
would
live
as
jack
brien
and
his
friends
were
living
at
henniker
and
was
supposed
to
enjoy
the
ease
of
his
inn
more
thoroughly
than
he
did
the
constraint
of
his
grand
establishment
at
the
present
moment
he
was
at
home
and
was
standing
at
the
gate
of
his
domain
all
alone
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
perhaps
listening
as
the
man
had
said
to
the
noise
of
his
own
he
was
dressed
in
black
with
a
on
his
head
and
certainly
did
not
look
like
a
miner
though
he
looked
as
little
like
a
gentleman
our
friends
were
in
what
they
conceived
to
be
proper
miners
costume
but
crinkett
knew
at
a
glance
that
there
was
something
uncommon
about
them
as
they
approached
he
did
not
attempt
to
open
the
gate
but
awaited
them
looking
over
the
top
of
it
from
the
inside
my
mates
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
said
still
remaining
on
his
side
and
apparently
intending
that
they
should
remain
on
theirs
then
caldigate
brought
forth
his
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
owner
of
the
place
across
the
top
of
the
gate
think
jones
wrote
to
you
about
us
before
said
caldigate
crinkett
read
the
letter
very
deliberately
perhaps
he
required
time
to
meditate
what
his
conduct
should
be
perhaps
he
was
not
quick
at
reading
written
letters
but
at
last
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
very
few
words
which
the
note
contained
he
said
was
much
account
when
he
was
out
here
do
know
a
great
deal
about
him
said
dick
when
he
heard
that
we
were
coming
he
offered
us
a
letter
to
you
said
caldigate
believe
him
to
be
an
honest
man
well
yes
i
daresay
he
honest
enough
he
never
robbed
me
of
nothing
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
because
i
know
how
to
take
care
that
he
do
nor
yet
nobody
else
as
he
said
this
he
looked
at
them
as
though
he
intended
that
they
were
included
among
the
numbers
against
whom
he
was
perfectly
on
his
guard
the
way
to
live
said
dick
the
way
i
live
my
friend
he
did
write
before
i
remember
saying
to
myself
what
a
pair
of
simpletons
you
must
be
if
you
was
thinking
of
going
to
ahalala
do
think
of
going
there
said
caldigate
road
open
to
you
nobody
wo
prevent
you
you
can
get
beef
and
mutton
there
and
damper
and
tea
no
doubt
and
what
they
call
brandy
as
long
as
you
got
the
money
to
pay
for
it
one
wo
say
anything
about
what
price
they
charge
you
have
you
got
any
money
then
caldigate
made
a
lengthened
speech
in
which
he
explained
so
much
of
their
circumstances
as
seemed
necessary
he
did
not
name
the
exact
sum
which
had
been
left
at
the
bank
in
melbourne
but
he
did
make
crinkett
understand
that
they
were
not
paupers
they
were
anxious
to
do
something
in
the
way
of
mining
and
particularly
anxious
to
make
money
but
they
did
not
quite
know
how
to
begin
could
he
give
them
a
hint
they
meant
to
work
with
their
own
hands
but
perhaps
it
might
be
well
for
them
at
first
to
hire
the
services
of
some
one
to
set
them
crinkett
listened
very
patiently
still
maintaining
his
position
on
his
own
side
of
the
gate
then
he
spoke
words
of
such
wisdom
as
was
in
him
is
just
the
place
to
ease
you
of
a
little
money
mind
i
tell
you
gold
of
course
there
been
gold
to
be
got
there
but
what
been
the
cost
of
it
what
been
the
return
if
sixteen
hundred
men
among
can
sell
fifteen
hundred
pounds
worth
of
gold
a
week
how
is
each
man
to
have
twenty
shillings
on
saturday
night
that
about
what
it
is
at
ahalala
of
course
there
gold
and
where
there
gold
chucked
about
in
that
way
just
on
the
surface
one
gets
it
and
ten
do
who
is
to
say
you
may
be
the
one
as
to
hiring
a
man
to
show
you
the
way
you
can
hire
a
dozen
as
long
as
you
pay
ten
shillings
to
loaf
about
you
may
have
men
enough
but
whether
they
show
you
the
way
to
anything
except
the
liquor
store
that
another
thing
now
shall
i
tell
you
what
you
two
gents
had
better
do
dick
declared
that
the
two
gents
would
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
if
he
would
take
that
trouble
course
you
heard
of
the
old
dick
told
him
that
they
had
heard
of
that
very
successful
mining
enterprise
since
their
arrival
at
nobble
ask
on
the

if
they
do
tell
you
about

crinkett
you
put
your
money

you
got
into
shares
accommodate
you

you
friends

any
reasonable
number

thought
you
purchased
out
all
the
shareholders
said
caldigate
i
did
and
now
i
redividing
it
i
rather
have
a
company
pleasanter
if
you
can
put
in
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
or
so
between
you
you
can
travel
about
and
see
the
country
and
your
money
be
working
for
you
all
the
time
did
you
ever
see
a
gold
mine
they
owned
that
they
never
yet
had
been
a
yard
below
ground
then
he
opened
his
gate
preparatory
to
taking
them
down
the
and
brought
them
with
him
into
one
of
the
front
rooms
it
was
a
large
parlour
only
half
furnished
not
yet
papered
without
a
carpet
in
which
it
appeared
that
crinkett
kept
his
own
belongings
here
he
divested
himself
of
his
black
clothes
and
put
on
a
suit
of
miner
garments
real
miner
garments
very
dirty
with
a
slouch
hat
on
the
top
of
which
there
was
a
lump
of
mud
in
which
to
stick
a
any
one
learned
in
the
matter
would
immediately
have
known
the
real
miner
if
you
like
to
see
a
mine
we
will
go
down
and
then
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
your
money
they
started
forth
crinkett
leading
the
way
and
entered
the
as
they
went
he
said
not
a
word
being
aware
that
gold
gold
that
they
could
see
with
their
eyes
in
its
raw
condition
would
tempt
them
more
surely
than
all
his
eloquence
in
the
the
three
of
them
got
into
a
box
or
truck
that
was
suspended
over
the
mouth
of
a
deep
shaft
and
soon
found
themselves
descending
through
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
went
down
about
four
hundred
feet
and
as
they
were
reaching
the
bottom
crinkett
remarked
that
it
was
goodish
deep
hole
all
to
belong
to
one
man
he
added
as
caldigate
extricated
himself
from
the
truck
there
a
precious
lot
more
gold
to
come
out
of
it
yet
i
can
tell
you
in
all
the
sights
to
be
seen
about
the
world
there
is
no
sight
in
which
there
is
less
to
be
seen
than
in
a
the
two
young
men
were
made
to
follow
their
conductor
along
a
very
dirty
underground
gallery
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
they
came
to
four
men
working
with
picks
in
a
rough
sort
of
chamber
and
four
others
driving
holes
in
the
walls
they
were
simply
picking
down
the
rock
in
doing
which
they
were
assisted
by
gunpowder
with
keen
eyes
crinkett
searched
along
the
roof
and
sides
and
at
last
showed
to
his
companions
one
or
two
little
specks
which
he
pronounced
to
be
gold
it
shows
itself
like
that
all
about
you
may
guess
whether
it
a
paying
concern
two
ounces
to
the
ton
my
boys
as
dick
and
caldigate
hitherto
knew
nothing
about
ounces
and
tons
in
reference
to
gold
and
as
they
had
heard
of
nuggets
and
lumps
of
gold
nearly
as
big
as
their
fist
they
were
not
much
exalted
by
what
they
saw
down
the
nor
did
they
like
the
darkness
and
dampness
and
dirt
and
dreariness
of
the
place
they
had
both
resolved
to
work
as
they
had
often
said
with
their
own
hands
but
in
thinking
over
it
their
imagination
had
not
pictured
to
them
so
uncomfortable
a
workshop
as
this
when
they
had
returned
to
the
light
the
owner
of
the
place
took
them
through
the
attached
showed
them
the
stone
or
mulloch
as
it
was
thrust
into
the
jaws
of
the
devouring
animal
and
then
brought
them
in
triumph
round
to
the
place
where
the
gold
was
eliminated
from
the
débris
of
mud
and
water
the
gold
did
not
seem
to
them
to
be
very
much
but
still
there
it
was
ounces
to
the
ton
my
boys
said
crinkett
as
he
brought
them
back
to
his
house
find
that
a
share
give
you
about
a
month
that
about
per
cent
i
guess
you
can
have
your
money
monthly
what
comes
out
of
that
there
mine
in
a
march
you
can
have
in
a
april
and
so
on
there
ai
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
not
as
i
knows
on
and
instead
of
working
your
hearts
out
you
can
be
just
amusing
yourselves
about
the
country
do
go
to
ahalala
unless
it
is
for
dropping
your
money
if
that
what
you
want
i
wo
say
but
ahalala
is
as
good
a
place
as
you
find
in
the
colony
then
he
brought
a
bottle
of
whisky
out
of
a
cupboard
and
treated
them
to
a
glass
of
grog
apiece
beyond
that
his
hospitality
did
not
go
dick
looked
as
though
he
liked
the
idea
of
having
a
venture
in
the
caldigate
without
actually
disbelieving
all
that
had
been
said
to
him
did
not
relish
the
proposal
it
was
not
the
kind
of
thing
which
they
had
intended
after
they
had
learned
their
trade
as
miners
it
might
be
very
well
for
them
to
have
shares
in
some
established
concern
but
in
that
case
he
would
wish
to
be
one
of
the
managers
himself
and
not
to
trust
everything
to
any
crinkett
however
honest
that
suggestion
of
travelling
about
and
amusing
themselves
did
not
commend
itself
to
him
new
south
wales
might
he
thought
be
a
good
country
for
work
but
did
not
seem
to
offer
much
amusement
beyond
sheer
idleness
and
rather
think
we
should
like
to
do
a
little
in
the
rough
first
he
said
very
little
go
a
long
way
with
you
i
thinking
do
see
that
at
all
said
dick
stoutly
go
down
there
and
take
one
of
them
picks
in
your
hand
for
a
week
eight
hours
at
a
time
with
five
minutes
spell
allowed
for
a
smoke
and
see
how
you
feel
at
the
end
of
the
week
try
it
on
if
you
give
us
for
the
week
said
caldigate
rubbing
his
hands
together
would
give
you
for
the
whole
time
between
you
and
you
would
earn
it
ten
shillings
a
day
i
suppose
you
think
a
man
has
only
just
to
say
the
word
and
become
a
miner
out
of
hand
you
a
deal
to
learn
before
you
be
worth
half
the
money
i
never
knew
chaps
like
you
come
to
any
good
at
working
if
you
got
a
little
money
you
know
i
shown
you
what
you
can
do
with
it
but
perhaps
you
have
the
conversation
was
ended
by
a
declaration
on
the
part
of
caldigate
that
they
would
take
a
week
to
think
over
crinkett
kind
proposition
and
that
they
might
as
well
occupy
the
time
by
taking
a
look
at
ahalala
a
place
that
had
been
so
much
praised
and
so
much
abused
must
be
worth
seeing
been
it
asked
crinkett
angrily
it
that
fool
jones
and
as
for
waiting
i
do
say
that
you
have
the
shares
at
that
price
next
week
in
this
way
he
waxed
angry
but
nevertheless
he
condescended
to
recommend
a
man
to
them
when
caldigate
declared
that
they
would
like
to
hire
some
practical
miner
to
accompany
them
mick
maggott
said
he
mining
as
well
as
anybody
you
hear
of
him
may
be
up
at
henniker
he
honest
and
if
you
can
keep
him
off
the
drink
do
as
well
as
anybody
but
neither
mick
nor
nobody
else
can
do
you
no
good
at
ahalala
with
that
he
led
them
out
of
the
gate
and
nodding
his
head
at
them
by
way
of
farewell
left
them
to
go
back
to
henniker
to
henniker
they
went
and
there
stretched
out
at
length
on
the
wooden
veranda
before
the
house
they
found
the
hero
of
the
potatoes
the
man
who
had
taken
them
down
to
crinkett
house
he
seemed
to
be
fast
asleep
but
as
they
came
up
on
the
boards
he
turned
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
at
them
mates
he
said
do
you
think
of
tom
crinkett
now
you
seen
him
does
seem
to
approve
of
ahalala
said
dick
course
he
do
when
a
new
rush
is
opened
like
that
and
takes
away
half
the
hands
a
man
has
about
him
and
raises
the
wages
of
them
who
remain
in
course
he
do
like
it
you
see
the
difference
the
old
is
an
established
kind
of
thing
a
paying
concern
i
suppose
said
caldigate
has
paid
not
a
doubt
about
it
whether
it
played
out
or
not
not
so
sure
but
ahalala
is
a
diggings
not
a
master
such
as
crinkett
is
now
of
course
crinkett
has
a
down
on
ahalala
friend
jack
brien
did
seem
to
think
much
of
the
place
said
dick
jack
is
one
of
them
who
never
has
a
stroke
of
luck
he
a
sort
of
chum
who
when
he
has
a
bottle
of
pickles
somebody
else
is
sure
to
eat
ahalala
is
so
bad
it
one
of
them
chancy
places
of
course
you
may
and
you
may
as
i
was
before
when
the
great
rush
was
on
i
did
uncommon
well
at
ahalala
i
never
was
the
man
i
was
then
became
of
it
asked
caldigate
with
a
smile
henniker
can
tell
you
that
or
any
other
publican
round
the
country
it
never
will
stick
to
me
i
do
know
why
but
it
never
will
i
had
my
luck
too
oh
laws
i
might
have
had
my
house
just
as
grand
as
polly
hooker
this
moment
only
i
never
could
stick
to
it
like
tom
crinkett
i
drank
cham
paign
out
of
buckets
i
have
rather
have
a
pot
of
beer
out
of
the
pewter
said
caldigate
like
one
does
drink
cham
paign
because
it
better
nor
anything
else
a
nobbler
of
brandy
worth
ten
of
it
it
the
glory
of
the
swells
at
their
own
game
there
was
a
chap
over
in
the
other
colony
shod
his
horse
with
gold
and
he
had
to
go
shepherding
afterwards
for
thirty
pounds
and
his
grub
but
it
something
for
him
to
have
ridden
a
horse
with
gold
shoes
you
never
seen
a
bucketful
of
cham
paign
in
the
old
country
when
both
dick
and
caldigate
had
owned
that
they
had
never
encountered
luxury
so
superabundant
and
had
discussed
the
matter
in
various
shapes
asking
whether
the
bucket
had
been
emptied
and
other
questions
of
the
same
nature
caldigate
inquired
of
his
friend
whether
he
knew
mick
maggott
maggott
said
the
man
jumping
up
to
his
feet
wants
mick
maggott
then
caldigate
explained
the
recommendation
which
crinkett
had
made
i
darned
mick
maggott
i
mick
maggott
myself
before
the
evening
was
over
an
arrangement
had
been
made
between
the
parties
and
had
even
been
written
on
paper
and
signed
by
all
the
three
mick
on
the
morrow
was
to
proceed
to
ahalala
with
his
new
comrades
and
was
to
remain
with
them
for
a
month
assisting
them
in
all
their
views
and
for
this
he
was
to
receive
ten
shillings
but
in
the
event
of
his
getting
drunk
he
was
to
be
liable
to
dismissal
at
once
mick
pleaded
hard
for
one
bout
of
drinking
during
the
month
but
when
dick
explained
that
one
bout
might
last
for
the
entire
time
he
acknowledged
that
the
objection
was
reasonable
and
assented
to
the
terms
proposed
chapter
xi
ahalala
it
was
all
settled
that
night
and
some
necessary
purchases
made
ahalala
was
miles
from
nobble
and
a
coach
had
been
established
through
the
bush
for
the
benefit
of
miners
going
to
the
diggings
but
mick
was
of
opinion
that
miners
ought
to
walk
with
their
swag
on
their
backs
when
the
distance
was
not
more
than
forty
miles
look
so
foolish
getting
out
of
one
of
them
rattletrap
coaches
he
said
everybody
axing
whether
you
going
to
pick
for
yourself
or
buy
a
share
in
a
claim
i
all
for
walking
if
it
ai
beneath
you
they
declared
themselves
quite
ready
to
walk
and
under
mick
guidance
they
went
out
and
bought
two
large
red
blankets
and
two
pannikins
mick
declared
that
if
they
went
without
swags
on
their
backs
and
pannikins
attached
to
their
swags
they
would
be
regarded
with
evil
eyes
by
all
who
saw
them
there
were
some
words
about
the
portmanteaus
mick
proposed
that
they
should
be
left
for
the
entire
month
in
the
charge
of
henniker
and
when
this
was
pronounced
impossible
he
was
for
a
while
disposed
to
be
off
the
bargain
caldigate
declared
that
with
all
his
ambition
to
be
a
miner
he
must
have
a
change
of
shirts
then
mick
pointed
to
the
swag
could
he
put
another
shirt
into
the
swag
it
was
at
last
settled
that
one
portmanteau
should
be
sent
by
the
coach
and
one
left
in
the
charge
of
henniker
sort
of
traps
ai
never
any
good
in
my
mind
said
mick
unmanly
having
all
them
togs
i
like
a
wash
as
well
as
any
man
trousers
jersey
drawers
and
all
always
at
when
i
get
a
place
for
a
rinse
by
the
side
of
a
creek
but
when
my
things
are
so
gone
that
they
wo
hang
on
comfortable
any
longer
i
chucks
away
and
buys
more
two
jerseys
is
good
and
two
drawers
is
good
because
of
wet
boots
is
awkward
and
i
allays
does
with
one
pair
some
have
two
and
ties
on
with
the
pannikin
but
it
ai
them
my
ideas
and
i
been
at
it
these
nine
years
you
come
to
the
same
the
three
started
the
next
morning
at
six
duly
invested
with
their
swags
before
they
went
they
found
henniker
up
with
hot
tea
boiled
beef
and
damper
one
drop
at
starting
for
the
good
of
the
house
said
mick
apologetically
whereupon
the
whisky
was
brought
and
mick
insisted
on
shouting
for
it
out
of
his
own
pocket
they
had
hardly
gone
a
mile
out
of
nobble
before
maggott
started
a
little
difficulty
merely
for
the
purpose
of
solving
it
with
a
hand
ai
to
be
no
misters
among
us
you
know
not
said
caldigate
name
mick
this
chap
name
dick
i
did
exactly
catch
i
suppose
you
been
kursened
they
christened
me
john
it
never
been
jack
with
you
do
think
it
ever
was
it
do
sound
lackadaisical
what
i
call
womanish
but
perhaps
for
the
better
we
have
such
a
lot
of
jacks
there
dirty
jack
and
jack
the
nigger
and
jack
misery
that
poor
jack
brien
and
a
lot
more
perhaps
you
would
like
not
another
name
of
that
sort
no
unless
it
necessary
ai
another
john
about
the
place
as
i
know
i
never
knew
a
john
down
a
mine
never
we
try
it
anyhow
and
so
that
was
settled
as
it
happened
though
dick
shand
had
always
been
dick
to
his
friend
caldigate
had
never
as
yet
been
either
john
or
jack
to
dick
shand
there
are
men
who
fall
into
the
way
of
being
called
by
their
christian
names
and
others
who
never
hear
them
except
from
their
own
family
but
before
the
day
was
out
caldigate
had
become
john
to
both
his
companions
do
sound
as
it
ought
to
do
not
yet
said
mick
after
he
had
tried
it
about
a
dozen
times
in
five
minutes
before
the
day
was
over
it
was
clear
that
mick
maggott
had
assumed
the
mastery
when
three
men
start
on
an
enterprise
together
one
man
must
be
let
the
republic
be
as
few
as
it
may
one
man
must
be
president
and
as
mick
knew
what
he
was
about
he
assumed
the
situation
easily
the
fact
that
he
was
to
receive
wages
from
the
others
had
no
bearing
on
the
subject
at
all
before
they
got
to
ahalala
caldigate
had
begun
to
appreciate
all
this
and
to
understand
in
part
what
they
would
have
to
do
during
this
month
and
how
they
would
have
to
live
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
at
once
fix
on
a
spot
out
a
claim
on
some
unoccupied
piece
of
ground
buy
for
themselves
a
small
tent
of
which
they
were
assured
that
they
would
find
many
for
sale
and
then
begin
to
sink
a
hole
when
they
entered
ahalala
caldigate
was
surprised
to
find
that
mick
was
the
most
tired
of
the
three
it
is
always
so
the
man
who
has
laboured
from
his
youth
upwards
can
endure
with
his
arms
it
is
he
who
has
had
leisure
to
shoot
to
play
cricket
to
climb
up
mountains
and
to
handle
a
racket
that
can
walk
if
you
ai
better
stuff
than
i
took
you
for
said
mick
as
the
three
let
the
swags
down
from
their
backs
on
the
veranda
of
ridley
hotel
at
ahalala
ahalala
was
a
very
different
place
from
nobble
made
nobble
seem
to
be
almost
a
compact
and
prosperous
city
at
nobble
there
was
at
any
rate
a
street
but
at
ahalala
everything
was
straggling
the
houses
such
as
they
were
stood
here
and
there
about
the
place
while
a
great
part
of
the
population
lived
under
canvas
and
then
ahalala
was
decidedly
in
the
forest
the
trees
around
had
not
yet
been
altogether
killed
nor
had
they
been
cut
down
in
sufficient
numbers
to
divest
the
place
of
its
forest
appearance
ahalala
was
leafy
and
therefore
though
much
less
regular
also
less
hideous
than
nobble
when
dick
first
made
tender
inquiry
as
to
the
comforts
of
an
hotel
he
was
assured
that
there
were
at
least
a
couple
of
dozen
but
the
place
was
bewildering
there
seemed
to
be
no
beginning
to
it
and
no
end
there
were
many
tracks
about
here
and
there
but
nothing
which
could
be
called
a
road
the
number
of
holes
was
infinite
each
hole
covered
by
a
rough
windlass
used
for
taking
out
the
dirt
which
was
thrown
loosely
anywhere
round
the
aperture
here
and
there
were
to
be
seen
little
red
flags
stuck
upon
the
end
of
poles
these
indicated
as
mick
informed
them
those
fortunate
adventures
in
which
gold
had
been
found
at
those
very
much
more
numerous
hillocks
which
showed
no
red
flag
the
labourers
were
hitherto
labouring
in
vain
there
was
a
little
tent
generally
near
to
each
hillock
in
which
the
miners
slept
packed
nearly
as
close
as
sheep
in
a
fold
as
our
party
made
its
way
through
the
midst
of
this
new
world
to
ridley
hotel
our
friend
observed
many
a
miner
sitting
at
his
evening
meal
each
generally
had
a
between
his
legs
out
of
which
he
was
helping
himself
to
meat
which
he
had
cooked
on
the
ashes
just
behind
him
sometimes
two
or
three
were
sharing
their
provisions
out
of
the
same
but
as
a
rule
each
miner
had
his
own
and
each
had
it
between
his
legs
before
they
had
been
at
ahalala
hours
they
also
had
their
tent
and
their
and
their
fire
and
had
pegged
out
their
claim
and
were
ready
to
commence
operations
on
the
morrow
it
was
soon
manifest
to
caldigate
and
dick
shand
that
they
would
have
been
very
much
astray
without
a
to
direct
them
three
or
four
hours
had
been
passed
in
forming
a
judgment
as
to
the
spot
on
which
they
should
commence
to
dig
and
in
making
his
choice
mick
had
been
guided
by
many
matters
as
to
which
our
two
adventurers
were
altogether
ignorant
it
might
be
that
mick
was
equally
so
but
he
at
any
rate
assumed
some
knowledge
he
looked
to
the
fall
of
the
ground
the
line
in
which
the
red
flags
were
to
be
traced
if
any
such
line
could
be
found
and
was
possessed
of
a
considerable
amount
of
jargon
as
to
topographical
mining
secrets
at
last
they
found
a
spot
near
a
creek
surrounded
by
perhaps
three
hundred
yards
from
the
nearest
adjacent
claim
and
as
mick
declared
in
a
direct
line
with
three
red
flags
here
they
determined
to
commence
their
operations
do
suppose
we
shall
do
any
good
said
caldigate
to
dick
we
must
make
a
beginning
if
only
for
the
sake
of
hardening
our
hands
we
shall
be
learning
something
at
the
time
even
though
we
only
shovel
up
so
much
mud
for
a
fortnight
they
shovelled
up
the
soil
continuously
without
any
golden
effects
and
so
far
without
any
feeling
of
disappointment
mick
had
told
them
that
if
they
found
a
speck
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
they
would
be
very
fortunate
they
had
their
windlass
and
they
worked
in
relays
one
man
at
the
bottom
one
man
at
the
wheel
and
one
man
idle
in
this
way
they
kept
up
their
work
during
eighteen
hours
of
the
day
each
man
in
this
way
worked
twelve
hours
and
had
twelve
for
sleeping
and
cooking
and
eating
other
occupation
they
had
none
during
the
fortnight
neither
of
them
went
any
further
distance
from
their
claim
than
to
the
neighbouring
shop
mick
often
expressed
his
admiration
at
their
continued
industry
not
understanding
the
spirit
which
will
induce
such
young
men
as
them
to
work
even
when
the
work
is
agonising
and
they
were
equally
charmed
with
mick
sobriety
and
loyalty
not
a
word
had
been
said
as
to
hours
of
work
and
yet
he
was
as
constant
to
their
long
hours
as
though
the
venture
was
his
own
as
though
there
was
no
question
of
wages
ai
had
a
drop
o
drink
yet
said
mick
one
night
we
a
holding
off
like
britons
there
was
great
triumph
in
his
voice
as
he
said
this
very
great
triumph
but
also
as
caldigate
thought
a
sound
of
longing
also
they
were
now
in
their
third
week
and
the
word
whisky
had
never
been
pronounced
between
them
at
this
moment
when
triumphant
ejaculation
was
uttered
they
were
all
lying
in
bed
it
shall
be
called
bed
by
way
of
compliment
they
had
bought
a
truss
of
straw
which
mick
had
declared
to
be
altogether
unnecessary
and
womanish
and
over
that
was
laid
a
white
sheet
which
caldigate
had
brought
with
him
from
england
this
too
had
roused
the
miner
wrath
nevertheless
he
condescended
to
lie
upon
it
this
was
their
bed
and
here
they
lay
each
wrapped
up
in
his
blanket
mick
in
the
middle
with
our
two
friends
at
the
sides
now
it
was
not
only
on
mick
account
but
quite
as
much
in
reference
to
dick
shand
that
caldigate
deprecated
any
reference
to
drink
the
abstention
hitherto
had
been
marvellous
he
himself
would
have
gone
daily
to
the
store
for
a
bottle
of
beer
but
that
he
recognised
the
expediency
of
keeping
them
away
from
the
place
he
had
heard
that
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
the
country
that
all
labour
was
done
without
drink
even
when
it
was
done
by
determined
drunkards
the
drunkard
would
work
for
a
month
and
then
drink
for
a
month
and
then
after
a
time
would
die
the
drink
almost
always
consisted
of
spirits
of
the
worst
description
it
seemed
to
be
recognised
by
the
men
that
work
and
drink
must
be
kept
separate
but
mick
mind
travelled
away
on
this
occasion
from
the
little
tent
to
the
delights
of
ridley
bar
have
had
a
drop
of
drink
yet
he
said
push
through
the
month
without
it
eh
old
boy
said
caldigate
would
i
give
for
a
pint
of
bitter
beer
said
shand
a
bottle
of
battleaxe
between
the
three
of
us
said
mick
battleaxe
being
the
name
for
a
certain
brand
of
brandy
a
drop
till
the
month
is
over
said
caldigate
turning
himself
round
in
his
blanket
then
there
were
whisperings
between
the
other
two
men
of
which
he
could
only
hear
the
hum
on
the
next
morning
at
six
caldigate
and
dick
shand
were
at
the
hole
together
it
was
caldigate
turn
to
work
till
noon
whereas
dick
went
off
at
nine
and
mick
would
come
on
from
nine
till
three
at
nine
mick
did
not
make
his
appearance
and
dick
declared
his
purpose
of
looking
after
him
caldigate
also
threw
down
his
tools
as
he
could
not
work
alone
and
went
in
search
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
he
did
not
see
either
of
his
companions
again
till
he
found
them
both
very
drunk
at
a
about
two
miles
away
from
their
claim
just
before
dusk
this
was
terrible
he
did
at
last
succeed
in
bringing
back
his
own
friend
to
the
tent
having
however
a
sad
task
in
doing
so
but
mick
maggott
would
not
be
moved
he
had
his
wits
about
him
enough
to
swear
that
he
cared
for
nothing
he
was
going
to
have
a
spree
nobody
had
ever
known
him
to
be
talked
out
of
it
when
he
had
once
set
his
mind
upon
it
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
it
now
and
he
meant
to
have
his
whack
this
was
what
he
said
of
himself
ai
no
good
john
it
ai
no
good
at
all
john
do
you
trouble
yourself
john
i
going
to
have
it
out
john
so
i
tell
you
this
he
said
nodding
his
head
about
in
a
maudlin
sort
of
way
and
refusing
to
allow
himself
to
be
moved
on
the
next
day
dick
shand
was
sick
repentant
and
idle
on
the
third
he
returned
to
his
work
working
however
with
difficulty
after
that
he
fairly
recovered
himself
and
the
two
cambridge
men
went
on
resolutely
at
their
hole
they
soon
found
how
hard
it
was
not
to
go
astray
without
their
instructed
mate
the
sides
of
the
shaft
became
crooked
and
uneven
and
the
windlass
sometimes
could
not
be
made
to
work
but
still
they
persevered
and
went
on
by
themselves
for
an
entire
week
without
a
sign
of
gold
during
this
time
various
fruitless
expeditions
were
made
by
both
the
men
in
search
of
maggott
he
was
still
at
the
same
but
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
it
at
last
they
found
him
with
the
incipient
horrors
of
delirium
tremens
and
yet
they
could
not
get
him
away
the
man
who
kept
the
place
was
quite
used
to
delirium
tremens
and
thought
nothing
about
it
when
caldigate
tried
a
high
moral
tone
everybody
around
him
laughed
at
him
they
had
been
digging
for
a
month
and
still
without
a
speck
of
gold
when
one
morning
early
mick
appeared
in
front
of
the
tent
it
was
then
about
eight
and
our
friends
had
stopped
their
work
to
eat
their
breakfast
the
poor
man
without
saying
a
word
came
and
crouched
down
before
them
not
in
shame
not
at
all
that
but
apparently
in
an
agony
of
sickness
had
my
bout
he
said
do
suppose
you
much
the
better
for
it
replied
caldigate
i
ai
none
the
better
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
me
yesterday
oh
laws
i
had
it
heavy
this
time
are
you
such
a
fool
you
see
john
some
of
us
is
born
fools
i
one
of
you
need
tell
me
i
know
all
about
it
without
any
sermoning
nobody
do
know
it
so
well
as
i
do
how
should
they
if
you
had
my
inside
now
and
my
head
oh
laws
it
up
man
easy
said
as
if
i
would
if
i
could
i
have
got
a
blessed
coin
left
to
buy
a
bite
of
bread
with
and
i
could
touch
a
morsel
if
i
had
ever
so
much
i
take
my
blanket
and
be
off
as
soon
as
i
can
move
all
this
time
he
had
been
crouching
but
now
he
threw
himself
at
length
upon
the
ground
of
course
they
did
what
they
could
for
the
poor
wretch
they
got
him
into
the
tent
and
they
made
him
swallow
some
tea
then
he
slept
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
eat
a
bit
of
meat
then
when
his
companions
were
at
their
work
he
carefully
packed
up
his
swag
and
fastening
it
on
to
his
back
appeared
by
the
side
of
the
hole
come
to
bid
you
he
said
are
you
going
mick
asked
caldigate
climbing
up
out
of
the
hole
by
the
rope
blessed
if
i
know
but
i
off
you
are
getting
that
hole
tarnation
crooked
the
man
was
going
without
any
allusion
to
the
wages
he
had
earned
or
to
the
work
that
he
had
done
but
then
in
truth
he
had
not
earned
his
wages
as
he
had
broken
his
contract
he
made
no
complaint
however
and
no
apology
but
was
prepared
to
start
all
nonsense
said
dick
catching
hold
of
him
put
your
swag
down
said
caldigate
also
catching
hold
of
the
other
shoulder
am
i
to
put
my
swag
down
for
i
back
to
nobble
crinkett
give
me
work
not
going
to
leave
us
in
that
way
said
dick
and
make
the
shaft
straight
said
caldigate
the
man
looked
irresolute
are
not
to
part
like
that
said
the
poor
fellow
be
friends
to
such
a
beast
as
i
be
but
i
stay
out
the
month
if
you
find
me
my
grub
shall
have
your
grub
and
your
money
too
do
you
think
forgotten
the
potatoes
the
potatoes
said
the
man
bursting
into
tears
then
he
chucked
away
his
swag
and
threw
himself
under
the
tent
upon
the
straw
the
next
day
he
was
making
things
as
straight
as
he
could
down
the
shaft
when
they
had
been
at
work
about
five
weeks
there
was
a
pole
stuck
into
their
heap
of
dirt
and
on
the
top
of
the
pole
there
was
a
little
red
flag
flying
at
about
thirty
feet
from
the
surface
when
they
had
already
been
obliged
to
insert
transverse
logs
in
the
shaft
to
prevent
the
sides
from
falling
in
they
had
come
upon
a
kind
of
soil
altogether
different
from
the
ordinary
clay
through
which
they
had
been
working
there
was
a
stratum
of
loose
shingle
or
gravelly
earth
running
apparently
in
a
sloping
direction
taking
the
decline
of
the
very
slight
hill
on
which
their
claim
was
situated
mick
as
soon
as
this
was
brought
to
light
became
an
altered
man
the
first
bucket
of
this
stuff
that
was
pulled
up
was
deposited
by
him
separately
and
he
at
once
sat
down
to
wash
it
this
he
did
in
an
open
tin
pan
handful
after
handful
he
washed
shifting
and
teasing
it
about
in
the
pan
and
then
he
cast
it
out
always
leaving
some
very
small
residuum
he
was
intent
upon
his
business
to
a
degree
that
caldigate
would
have
thought
to
be
beyond
the
man
nature
with
extreme
patience
he
went
on
washing
handful
after
handful
all
the
day
while
the
other
two
pulled
up
fresh
buckets
of
the
same
stuff
he
would
not
pause
to
eat
or
hardly
to
talk
at
last
there
came
a
loud
exclamation
we
got
it
then
dick
and
caldigate
stooping
down
were
shown
four
or
five
little
specks
in
the
angle
of
the
pan
bottom
before
the
sun
had
set
they
had
stuck
up
their
little
red
flag
and
a
crowd
of
neighbours
was
standing
round
them
asking
questions
as
to
their
success
chapter
xii
mademoiselle
cettini
after
three
days
of
successful
washing
when
it
became
apparent
that
a
shed
must
be
built
and
that
if
possible
some
further
labour
must
be
hired
mick
said
that
he
must
go
ai
earned
nothing
he
said
of
that
bout
and
i
ai
going
to
ask
for
nothing
but
i
stand
this
any
longer
i
hope
you
make
your
fortins
then
came
the
explanation
it
was
not
possible
he
said
that
a
regular
miner
such
as
he
was
should
be
a
party
to
such
a
grand
success
without
owning
a
share
in
it
he
was
quite
aware
that
nothing
belonged
to
him
he
was
working
for
wages
and
he
had
forfeited
them
but
he
could
see
the
gold
coming
out
under
his
hands
in
pailfuls
and
feel
that
none
of
it
belonged
to
him
then
it
was
agreed
that
there
should
be
no
more
talk
of
wages
and
that
each
should
have
a
third
share
in
the
concern
very
much
was
said
on
the
matter
of
drink
in
all
of
which
caldigate
was
clever
enough
to
impose
on
his
friend
dick
the
heavy
responsibility
of
a
mentor
a
man
who
has
once
been
induced
to
preach
to
another
against
a
fault
will
feel
himself
somewhat
constrained
by
his
own
sermons
mick
would
make
no
promises
but
declared
his
intention
of
trying
very
hard
knock
me
down
as
soon
as
i
goes
a
yard
off
the
claim
that
be
best
and
so
they
renewed
their
work
and
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
from
the
commencement
of
their
operations
sold
nine
ounces
of
gold
to
the
manager
of
the
little
branch
bank
which
had
already
established
itself
at
ahalala
these
were
hardly
but
gold
is
an
article
which
adds
fervour
to
the
imagination
and
almost
creates
a
power
for
romance
other
matters
however
were
not
running
smoothly
with
john
caldigate
at
this
eventful
time
to
have
found
gold
so
soon
after
their
arrival
was
no
doubt
a
great
triumph
and
justified
him
in
writing
a
long
letter
to
his
father
in
which
he
explained
what
he
had
done
and
declared
that
he
looked
forward
to
success
with
confidence
but
still
he
was
far
from
being
at
ease
he
could
not
suffer
himself
to
remain
hidden
at
ahalala
without
saying
something
of
his
whereabouts
to
smith
after
what
had
happened
between
them
he
would
be
odious
to
himself
if
he
omitted
to
keep
the
promise
which
he
had
made
to
her
and
yet
he
would
so
fain
have
forgotten
her
or
rather
have
wiped
away
from
the
reality
of
his
past
life
that
one
episode
had
it
been
possible
a
month
separation
had
taught
him
to
see
how
very
silly
he
had
been
in
regard
to
this
woman
and
had
also
detracted
much
from
those
charms
which
had
delighted
him
on
board
ship
she
was
pretty
she
was
clever
she
had
the
knack
of
being
a
pleasant
companion
but
how
much
more
than
all
these
was
wanted
in
a
wife
and
then
he
knew
nothing
about
her
she
might
be
or
have
been
all
that
was
disreputable
if
he
could
not
shake
himself
free
from
her
she
would
be
a
millstone
round
his
neck
he
was
aware
of
all
that
and
as
he
thought
of
it
he
would
think
also
of
the
face
of
hester
bolton
and
remember
her
form
as
she
sat
silent
in
the
big
house
at
chesterton
but
nevertheless
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
write
to
smith
he
had
promised
that
he
would
do
so
and
he
must
keep
his
word
the
name
of
the
woman
had
not
been
mentioned
between
him
and
dick
shand
since
they
left
the
ship
dick
had
been
curious
but
had
been
afraid
to
inquire
and
had
in
his
heart
applauded
the
courage
of
the
man
who
had
thus
been
able
to
shake
off
at
once
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
amused
himself
caldigate
himself
was
continually
meditating
as
he
worked
with
the
windlass
in
his
hand
or
with
his
pick
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
whether
in
conformity
with
the
usages
of
the
world
he
could
not
simply
drop
her
then
he
remembered
the
words
which
had
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
and
he
could
not
do
it
he
was
as
yet
too
young
to
be
at
the
same
time
so
wise
and
so
hard
shall
hold
you
as
engaged
to
me
he
had
said
myself
as
engaged
to
you
and
he
remembered
the
tones
of
her
voice
as
with
her
last
words
she
had
said
to
him
love
my
love
they
had
been
very
pleasant
to
him
then
but
now
they
were
most
unfortunate
they
were
unfortunate
because
there
had
been
a
power
in
them
from
which
he
was
now
unable
to
extricate
himself
therefore
during
one
of
those
leisure
periods
in
which
mick
and
dick
were
at
work
he
wrote
his
letter
with
the
paper
on
his
knees
squatting
down
just
within
his
tent
on
a
deal
case
which
had
contained
boxes
of
sardines
bottles
of
pickles
and
cans
of
jam
for
now
in
their
prosperity
they
had
advanced
somewhat
beyond
the
simple
plenty
of
the
it
was
a
difficult
letter
to
write
should
it
be
ecstatic
and
loving
or
cold
and
severe
or
light
and
therefore
false
own
one
here
i
am
i
have
struck
gold
come
to
me
and
share
it
that
would
have
been
ecstatic
and
loving
is
a
hard
life
this
and
not
fit
for
a
woman
weakness
but
it
must
be
my
life
and
therefore
let
there
be
an
end
of
all
between
us
that
would
have
been
cold
and
severe
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
dick
and
i
are
shoving
along
it
is
half
as
nice
as
on
board
ship
hope
to
see
you
before
long
and
am
yours
just
the
same
as
ever
that
would
have
been
light
and
false
keeping
the
word
of
promise
to
the
ear
but
breaking
it
to
the
heart
he
could
not
write
either
of
these
he
began
by
describing
what
they
had
done
and
had
completed
two
pages
before
he
had
said
a
word
of
their
peculiar
circumstances
in
regard
to
each
other
he
felt
that
his
letter
was
running
into
mere
gossip
and
was
not
such
as
she
would
have
a
right
to
expect
if
any
letter
were
sent
at
all
there
must
be
something
more
in
it
than
all
this
and
so
after
much
thinking
of
it
he
at
last
rushed
as
it
were
into
hot
words
and
ended
it
as
follows
have
put
off
to
the
last
what
i
have
really
got
to
say
let
me
know
what
you
are
doing
and
what
you
wish
and
whether
you
love
me
i
have
not
as
yet
the
power
of
offering
you
a
home
but
i
trust
that
the
time
may
come
these
last
words
were
false
he
knew
that
they
were
false
but
the
falseness
was
not
of
a
nature
to
cause
him
to
be
ashamed
it
shames
no
man
to
swear
that
he
loves
a
woman
when
he
has
ceased
to
love
her
but
it
does
shame
him
to
drop
off
from
the
love
which
he
has
promised
he
balanced
the
matter
in
his
mind
for
a
while
before
he
would
send
his
letter
then
getting
up
quickly
he
rushed
forth
and
dropped
it
into
the
box
the
very
next
day
chance
brought
to
ahalala
one
who
had
been
a
passenger
on
board
the
goldfinder
and
the
man
hearing
of
the
success
of
shand
and
caldigate
came
to
see
them
course
you
know
said
the
man
your
is
doing
down
at
sydney
dick
shand
who
was
present
replied
that
they
had
heard
nothing
of
any
caldigate
understood
at
once
to
whom
the
allusion
was
made
and
was
silent
here
said
the
man
bringing
a
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
and
pointing
to
a
special
advertisement
do
you
think
that
is
the
advertisement
declared
that
mademoiselle
cettini
would
on
such
and
such
a
night
sing
a
certain
number
of
songs
and
dance
a
certain
number
of
dances
and
perform
a
certain
number
of
tableaux
at
a
certain
theatre
in
sydney
your
smith
said
the
man
turning
to
caldigate
am
very
glad
she
has
got
employment
said
caldigate
she
is
not
my
mrs
smith
all
thought
that
you
and
she
were
very
thick
the
same
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
she
is
not
my
smith
repeated
caldigate
endeavouring
to
appear
unconcerned
but
hardly
able
to
conceal
his
anger
dancing
dances
singing
songs
and
acting
tableaux
and
all
under
the
name
of
mademoiselle
cettini
nothing
could
be
worse
unless
indeed
it
might
be
of
service
to
him
to
know
that
she
was
earning
her
bread
and
therefore
not
in
distress
and
earning
it
after
a
fashion
of
which
he
would
be
at
liberty
to
express
his
disapproval
nothing
more
was
said
at
the
time
about
smith
and
the
man
went
his
way
ten
days
afterwards
caldigate
in
the
presence
both
of
mick
and
dick
declared
his
purpose
of
going
down
to
sydney
luggage
must
be
looked
after
said
he
i
have
a
friend
whom
i
want
to
see
he
added
not
choosing
to
lie
at
this
time
all
was
going
successfully
with
them
mick
maggott
lived
in
such
a
manner
that
no
one
near
him
would
have
thought
that
he
knew
what
whisky
meant
his
had
returned
to
him
and
he
was
manifestly
there
had
come
to
be
necessity
for
complicated
woodwork
below
the
surface
and
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
skilled
miner
and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
our
two
friends
were
as
well
assured
of
his
honesty
as
of
their
own
he
had
been
a
veritable
godsend
to
them
and
would
remain
so
could
he
be
kept
away
from
the
you
go
away
do
you
think
he
break
out
dick
asked
when
they
were
alone
together
hope
not
he
seems
to
have
been
steadied
by
success
at
any
rate
i
must
go
it
to
see
mrs
smith
dick
as
he
asked
the
question
put
on
his
most
serious
face
he
did
not
utter
the
name
as
though
he
were
finding
fault
the
time
that
had
passed
had
been
sufficient
to
quench
the
unpleasantness
of
their
difference
on
board
ship
he
was
justified
in
asking
his
friend
such
a
question
and
caldigate
felt
that
it
was
so
am
you
think
upon
the
whole
i
do
like
to
interfere
but
upon
my
word
the
thing
is
so
important
think
i
had
better
not
see
her
do
lie
to
her
is
fair
in
love
and
war
means
that
no
faith
is
due
to
a
woman
i
can
not
live
by
such
a
doctrine
i
do
not
mind
owning
to
you
that
i
wish
i
could
do
as
you
bid
me
i
ca
i
can
not
be
so
false
i
must
go
old
fellow
but
i
know
all
that
you
would
say
to
me
and
i
will
endeavour
to
escape
honestly
from
this
trouble
and
so
he
went
yes
to
escape
honestly
from
that
trouble
but
how
it
is
just
that
trouble
from
which
there
is
no
honest
escape
unless
a
man
may
honestly
break
his
word
he
had
engaged
himself
to
her
so
much
that
simply
to
ignore
her
would
be
cowardly
as
well
as
false
there
was
but
one
thing
that
he
could
do
but
one
step
that
he
could
take
by
which
his
security
and
his
might
both
be
maintained
he
would
tell
her
the
exact
truth
and
put
it
to
her
whether
looking
at
their
joint
circumstances
it
would
not
be
better
that
they
should
part
reflecting
on
this
during
his
three
days
journey
down
to
sydney
it
was
thus
that
he
resolved
forgetting
altogether
in
his
meditations
the
renewed
force
of
the
woman
charms
upon
himself
as
he
went
from
the
railway
station
at
sydney
to
the
inn
at
which
he
located
himself
he
saw
the
hoardings
on
all
sides
placarded
with
the
name
of
mademoiselle
cettini
and
there
was
a
picture
on
some
of
these
placards
of
a
wonderful
female
without
much
clothes
which
was
supposed
to
represent
some
tragic
figure
in
a
tableau
there
was
the
woman
whom
he
was
to
make
his
wife
he
had
travelled
all
night
and
had
intended
to
seek
smith
immediately
after
his
breakfast
but
so
unhappy
was
he
so
much
disgusted
by
the
tragic
figure
in
the
picture
that
he
postponed
his
visit
and
went
after
his
luggage
his
luggage
was
all
right
in
the
warehouse
and
he
arranged
that
it
should
be
sent
down
to
nobble
waggons
with
stores
did
make
their
way
to
nobble
from
the
nearest
railway
station
and
hopes
were
held
out
that
the
packages
might
be
there
in
six
weeks
time
he
would
have
been
willing
to
postpone
their
arrival
for
twelve
months
for
months
could
he
as
compensation
have
been
enabled
to
postpone
with
honour
his
visit
to
smith
for
the
same
time
soon
after
noon
however
his
time
was
vacant
and
he
rushed
to
his
fate
she
had
sent
him
her
address
and
he
found
her
living
in
very
decent
lodgings
overlooking
the
public
park
he
was
at
once
shown
up
to
her
room
where
he
found
her
at
breakfast
you
have
come
she
said
then
when
the
door
was
shut
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
he
was
dressed
as
a
miner
might
be
dressed
who
was
off
work
and
out
for
a
holiday
clean
rough
and
arranged
with
a
studied
intention
to
look
as
little
like
a
gentleman
as
possible
the
main
figure
and
manner
were
so
completely
those
of
a
gentleman
that
the
disguise
was
not
perfect
but
yet
he
was
rough
she
was
dressed
with
all
the
pretty
care
which
a
woman
can
use
when
she
expects
her
lover
to
see
her
in
morning
costume
anything
more
unlike
the
smith
of
the
ship
could
not
be
imagined
if
she
had
been
attractive
then
what
was
she
now
if
her
woman
charms
sufficed
to
overcome
his
prudence
while
they
were
so
clouded
what
effect
would
they
have
upon
him
now
and
she
was
in
his
arms
here
there
was
no
quartermaster
to
look
after
the
proprieties
no
crompton
no
callander
no
miss
green
to
watch
with
a
hundred
eyes
for
the
exchange
of
a
chance
kiss
in
some
moment
of
bliss
you
have
come
oh
my
darling
oh
my
love
no
doubt
it
was
all
just
as
it
should
be
if
a
lady
may
not
call
the
man
to
whom
she
is
engaged
her
love
and
her
darling
what
proper
use
can
there
be
for
such
words
and
into
whose
arms
is
she
to
jump
if
not
into
his
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
he
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
have
arranged
it
all
by
letter
cettini
he
asked
but
he
smiled
as
he
put
the
question
it
was
intended
to
be
serious
but
still
he
could
not
be
hard
upon
her
all
at
once
fifty
thousand
fools
do
understand
there
to
be
fifty
thousand
people
in
sydney
as
to
which
i
know
nothing
or
why
ever
so
many
million
fools
in
london
if
i
called
myself
smith
nobody
would
come
and
see
me
if
i
called
myself
madame
cettini
not
nearly
so
many
would
come
you
have
got
to
inculcate
into
the
minds
of
the
people
an
idea
that
a
pure
young
girl
is
going
to
jump
about
for
their
diversion
they
know
it
is
so
but
there
must
be
a
flavour
of
the
idea
it
is
nice
but
one
has
to
live
you
ever
cettini
before
when
i
was
on
the
stage
as
a
girl
then
he
thought
he
remembered
that
she
had
once
told
him
some
particular
in
regard
to
her
early
life
which
was
incompatible
with
this
unless
indeed
she
had
gone
under
more
than
one
name
before
she
was
married
used
as
a
child
to
dance
and
sing
under
that
name
it
your
father
name
she
smiled
as
she
answered
want
to
discover
all
the
little
mean
secrets
of
my
life
at
once
and
do
not
reflect
that
in
so
far
as
they
were
mean
they
are
disagreeable
as
subjects
of
conversation
i
was
not
mean
myself
am
sure
of
that
you
are
sure
of
it
is
not
that
enough
of
course
i
have
been
among
low
people
if
not
why
should
i
have
been
a
singer
on
the
stage
at
so
early
an
age
why
a
dancer
why
should
i
have
married
such
a
one
as
mr
smith
do
not
know
of
what
sort
he
was
said
caldigate
is
not
the
time
to
ask
when
you
have
just
come
to
see
me
when
i
am
so
delighted
to
see
you
oh
it
is
such
a
pleasure
i
have
not
had
a
nice
word
spoken
to
me
since
i
left
the
goldfinder
come
and
take
a
walk
in
the
gardens
nobody
knows
me
off
the
stage
yet
and
nobody
knows
you
so
we
can
do
just
as
we
like
come
and
tell
me
about
the
gold
he
did
go
and
did
tell
her
about
the
gold
and
before
he
had
been
with
her
an
hour
sitting
about
on
the
benches
in
that
loveliest
of
all
places
the
public
gardens
at
sydney
he
was
almost
happy
with
her
it
was
now
late
in
the
autumn
in
may
but
the
end
of
the
autumn
in
sydney
is
the
most
charming
time
of
the
year
he
spent
the
whole
day
with
her
dining
with
her
in
her
lodgings
at
five
in
order
that
he
might
take
her
to
the
theatre
at
seven
she
had
said
a
great
deal
to
him
about
her
performances
declaring
that
he
would
find
them
to
be
neither
vulgar
nor
disagreeable
she
told
him
that
she
had
no
friend
in
sydney
but
that
she
had
been
able
to
get
an
engagement
for
a
fortnight
at
melbourne
and
had
been
very
shortly
afterwards
pressed
to
come
on
to
sydney
she
listened
not
only
with
patience
but
apparently
with
the
greatest
pleasure
to
all
that
he
could
tell
her
of
dick
shand
and
crinkett
and
mick
maggott
arousing
herself
quite
to
enthusiasm
when
he
came
to
the
finding
of
the
gold
but
there
was
not
a
word
said
the
whole
day
as
to
their
future
combined
prospects
nor
was
there
any
more
outspoken
allusion
to
loves
and
darlings
or
any
repetition
of
that
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
for
once
it
was
natural
if
she
were
wanted
thus
again
the
action
must
be
his
not
hers
she
was
clever
enough
to
know
that
do
you
think
of
it
she
said
when
he
waited
to
take
her
home
is
the
only
good
dancing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
but
will
tell
you
me
whatever
you
think
and
you
will
see
that
i
will
attend
to
you
come
about
eleven
not
sooner
as
i
shall
not
be
dressed
now
chapter
xiii
coming
back
the
letter
which
caldigate
wrote
to
his
father
from
ahalala
telling
him
of
the
discovery
of
gold
upon
their
claim
contained
the
first
tidings
which
reached
folking
of
the
wanderer
and
that
was
not
received
till
seven
or
eight
months
had
passed
by
since
he
left
the
place
the
old
squire
during
that
time
had
lived
a
very
solitary
life
in
regard
to
his
nephew
whom
he
had
declared
his
purpose
of
partially
adopting
he
had
expressed
himself
willing
to
pay
for
his
education
but
had
not
proposed
to
receive
him
at
folking
and
as
to
that
matter
of
heirship
he
gave
his
brother
to
understand
that
it
was
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
settled
thing
folking
was
now
his
own
to
do
what
he
liked
with
it
and
as
such
it
was
to
remain
but
he
would
treat
his
nephew
as
a
son
while
the
nephew
seemed
to
him
to
merit
such
treatment
as
for
the
estate
he
was
not
at
all
sure
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
the
community
at
large
and
for
the
caldigate
family
in
particular
that
it
should
be
cut
up
and
sold
in
small
parcels
there
was
a
long
correspondence
between
him
and
his
brother
which
was
ended
by
his
declaring
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
any
of
the
family
just
at
present
at
folking
he
was
low
in
spirits
and
would
prefer
to
be
alone
he
was
very
low
in
spirits
and
completely
alone
all
those
who
knew
anything
about
him
and
they
were
very
few
the
tenants
perhaps
and
servants
and
old
bolton
were
of
opinion
that
he
had
torn
his
son
out
from
all
place
in
his
heart
had
so
thoroughly
disinherited
the
sinner
not
only
from
his
house
and
acres
but
from
his
love
that
they
did
not
believe
him
capable
of
suffering
from
regret
but
even
they
knew
very
little
of
the
man
as
he
wandered
about
alone
among
the
dikes
as
he
sat
alone
among
his
books
even
as
he
pored
over
the
volumes
which
were
always
in
his
hand
he
was
ever
mourning
and
moaning
over
his
desolation
his
wife
and
daughters
had
been
taken
from
him
by
the
hand
of
god
but
how
had
it
come
to
pass
that
he
had
also
lost
his
son
that
son
who
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
when
he
had
first
heard
of
those
dealings
with
davis
while
john
was
amusing
himself
with
the
frivolities
of
babington
he
had
been
full
of
wrath
and
had
declared
to
himself
that
the
young
man
must
be
expelled
if
not
from
all
affection
yet
from
all
esteem
and
he
had
gone
on
to
tell
himself
that
it
would
be
unprofitable
for
him
to
live
with
a
son
whom
he
did
not
esteem
then
it
had
come
to
pass
that
arguing
it
out
in
his
own
mind
rationally
as
he
had
thought
but
still
under
the
impulse
of
hot
anger
he
had
determined
that
it
was
better
that
they
should
part
even
though
the
parting
should
be
for
ever
but
now
he
had
almost
forgotten
davis
had
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
till
he
had
taught
himself
to
think
that
the
disruption
had
been
altogether
his
son
work
and
in
no
degree
his
own
his
son
had
not
loved
him
he
had
not
been
able
to
inspire
his
son
with
love
he
was
solitary
and
wretched
because
he
had
been
harsh
and
unforgiving
that
was
his
own
judgment
as
to
himself
but
he
never
said
a
word
of
his
feelings
to
any
human
being
john
had
promised
to
write
the
promise
had
not
been
very
enthusiastically
given
but
still
as
the
months
went
by
it
was
constantly
remembered
the
young
man
after
leaving
cambridgeshire
had
remained
some
weeks
at
the
shands
house
before
he
had
started
and
from
thence
he
had
not
written
the
request
had
been
that
he
should
write
from
australia
and
the
correspondence
between
him
and
his
father
had
always
been
so
slight
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
write
from
pollington
but
caldigate
had
not
expected
but
hoped
that
a
letter
might
come
at
the
last
moment
he
knew
to
a
day
to
an
hour
when
the
vessel
would
sail
from
plymouth
there
might
have
been
a
letter
from
plymouth
but
no
letter
came
and
then
the
months
went
by
slowly
the
son
did
not
write
from
melbourne
nor
from
nobble
nor
from
ahalala
till
gold
had
been
found
so
it
came
to
pass
that
nearly
eight
months
had
passed
and
that
the
father
had
told
himself
again
and
again
that
his
son
had
torn
himself
altogether
away
from
all
remembrance
of
his
home
before
the
letter
came
it
was
not
a
long
letter
but
it
was
very
satisfactory
the
finding
of
the
gold
was
in
itself
of
course
a
great
thing
but
the
manner
in
which
it
was
told
without
triumph
or
exultation
but
with
an
air
of
sober
industrious
determination
was
much
more
and
then
there
was
a
word
or
two
at
the
end
father
i
think
of
you
every
day
and
am
already
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
i
may
return
and
see
you
again
as
he
read
it
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
unluckily
the
old
housekeeper
came
into
the
room
at
the
same
time
it
from
john
sir
he
had
to
recover
himself
and
to
get
rid
of
his
tears
and
to
answer
the
old
woman
in
an
unconcerned
tone
all
in
a
moment
and
it
disconcerted
him
yes
he
said
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
he
well
sir
daresay
he
is
he
does
say
it
about
business
did
you
hear
me
say
that
i
tell
you
another
time
and
so
the
old
woman
was
turned
out
of
the
room
having
seen
the
tear
and
heard
the
little
gurgle
in
the
throat
seems
to
be
doing
well
the
squire
said
to
holt
has
got
a
couple
of
partners
and
they
have
succeeded
in
finding
gold
he
may
probably
come
back
some
day
but
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
for
the
next
twenty
years
after
that
he
marked
the
posts
which
he
knew
came
from
that
part
of
the
world
by
san
francisco
and
had
resolved
not
to
expect
anything
by
that
of
the
next
month
when
there
came
a
day
before
its
time
a
much
longer
letter
than
the
last
in
this
there
was
given
a
detailed
description
of
the
at
ahalala
which
had
already
been
named
folking
much
was
said
of
mick
and
much
was
said
of
dick
both
of
whom
were
working
steady
as
rocks
the
number
of
ounces
extracted
were
stated
with
the
amount
of
profits
which
had
been
divided
and
something
was
said
as
to
the
nature
of
their
life
at
ahalala
they
were
still
living
under
their
original
tent
but
were
meditating
the
erection
of
a
wooden
shanty
ahalala
the
writer
said
was
not
a
place
at
which
a
prosperous
miner
could
expect
to
locate
himself
for
many
years
but
the
prospects
were
good
enough
to
justify
some
present
attention
to
personal
comforts
all
this
was
rational
pleasant
and
straightforward
and
in
the
letter
there
was
no
tone
or
touch
of
the
old
quarrel
it
was
full
and
cordial
such
as
any
son
might
write
to
any
father
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
there
was
no
mention
made
in
it
of
smith
it
was
written
after
the
return
of
john
caldigate
from
sydney
to
ahalala
but
contained
no
reference
to
any
matrimonial
projects
letters
then
came
regularly
month
by
month
and
were
always
regularly
answered
till
a
chance
reader
would
have
thought
that
no
father
and
no
son
stood
on
better
terms
with
each
other
there
had
been
misfortunes
but
the
misfortunes
did
not
seem
to
touch
john
caldigate
himself
after
three
months
of
hard
work
and
steady
conduct
mick
maggott
had
broken
out
and
had
again
taken
to
drinking
champagne
out
of
buckets
efforts
were
made
with
infinite
trouble
to
reclaim
him
which
would
be
successful
for
a
time
and
then
again
he
would
slip
away
into
the
mud
and
then
shand
would
sometimes
go
into
the
mud
with
him
and
shand
when
drunk
would
be
more
unmanageable
even
than
mick
and
this
went
on
till
mick
had
killed
himself
and
dick
shand
had
disappeared
grieve
for
the
man
as
for
a
dear
friend
he
said
in
one
of
his
father
letters
he
has
been
as
true
to
me
as
steel
in
all
things
save
drink
and
i
feel
that
i
have
learned
under
him
the
practical
work
of
a
as
it
can
not
be
learned
except
by
the
unwearied
attention
of
the
teacher
could
he
have
kept
from
spirits
this
man
would
have
made
a
large
fortune
and
would
have
deserved
it
for
he
was
indefatigable
and
in
resources
such
was
the
history
of
poor
mick
maggott
and
shand
history
was
told
also
shand
strayed
away
to
queensland
and
then
returning
was
again
admitted
to
a
certain
degree
of
partnership
and
then
again
fell
into
drink
and
at
last
deserting
the
trade
of
a
miner
tried
his
hand
at
various
kinds
of
work
till
at
last
he
became
a
simple
shepherd
from
time
to
time
caldigate
sent
him
money
when
he
was
in
want
of
it
but
they
had
not
again
come
together
as
associates
in
their
work
all
this
was
told
in
his
monthly
letters
which
came
to
be
expected
at
folking
till
each
letter
was
regarded
as
the
rising
of
a
new
sun
there
is
a
style
of
which
seems
to
indicate
strength
of
purpose
and
a
general
healthy
condition
on
the
part
of
the
writer
in
all
his
letters
the
son
spoke
of
himself
and
his
doings
with
confidence
and
serenity
somewhat
surprising
his
father
after
a
while
by
always
desiring
to
be
remembered
to
and
miss
bolton
this
went
on
not
only
from
month
to
month
but
from
year
to
year
till
at
the
end
of
three
years
from
the
date
at
which
the
son
had
left
folking
there
had
come
to
be
a
complete
confidence
between
him
and
his
father
john
caldigate
had
gone
into
partnership
with
crinkett
who
had
indeed
tried
to
cheat
him
wretchedly
but
had
failed
and
at
that
time
was
the
manager
of
the
polyeuka
mine
the
claim
at
ahalala
had
been
sold
and
he
had
deserted
the
flashy
insecurity
of
alluvial
searchings
for
the
fundamental
security
of
he
was
deep
in
the
crushing
of
quartz
and
understood
well
the
meaning
of
two
ounces
to
the
ton
that
glittering
boast
by
which
crinkett
had
at
first
thought
to
allure
him
from
time
to
time
he
sent
money
home
paying
back
to
his
father
and
to
bolton
bank
what
had
been
borrowed
on
the
estate
for
there
had
passed
between
them
many
communications
respecting
folking
the
extravagances
of
the
son
became
almost
the
delight
of
the
father
when
the
father
had
become
certain
of
the
son
reform
there
had
been
even
jocular
reference
to
davis
and
a
complete
understanding
as
to
the
amount
of
money
to
be
given
to
the
nephew
in
compensation
for
the
blighted
hopes
as
to
the
reversion
of
the
property
why
it
should
have
been
that
these
years
of
absence
should
have
endeared
to
john
caldigate
a
place
which
while
it
was
his
home
had
always
been
distasteful
to
him
i
can
not
perhaps
explain
to
those
readers
who
have
never
strayed
far
from
their
original
nests
and
to
those
who
have
been
wanderers
i
certainly
need
not
explain
it
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
he
could
base
the
expression
of
his
desires
as
to
folking
on
the
foundation
of
substantial
remittances
he
was
not
slow
to
say
that
he
should
like
to
keep
the
place
he
knew
that
he
had
no
right
to
the
reversion
but
perhaps
his
father
would
sympathise
with
his
desire
to
buy
back
his
right
his
father
with
all
his
political
tenets
as
to
land
with
his
admiration
as
to
the
french
system
with
his
loud
denunciations
of
the
absurdity
of
binding
a
special
family
to
a
special
fraction
of
the
earth
surface
did
sympathise
with
him
so
strongly
that
he
at
once
accepted
the
arrangement
think
that
his
conduct
has
given
him
a
right
to
demand
it
he
said
to
bolton
do
quite
see
that
money
certainly
gives
a
man
great
powers
if
he
has
money
enough
he
can
buy
the
succession
to
folking
if
you
choose
to
sell
it
to
him
mean
as
my
son
said
the
father
somewhat
proudly
was
the
heir
he
ceased
to
be
so
by
his
own
doing
i
advised
you
to
think
longer
over
it
before
you
allowed
him
to
dispossess
himself
certainly
has
been
all
for
the
best
hope
so
but
when
you
talk
of
his
right
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
has
none
folking
is
now
yours
without
encumbrance
and
you
can
give
it
to
whom
you
please
was
he
who
paid
off
the
mortgage
have
told
me
that
he
sent
you
part
of
the
money
but
between
you
and
him
i
am
very
glad
caldigate
that
your
son
has
done
so
well
and
the
more
so
perhaps
because
the
early
promise
was
not
good
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
a
successful
will
settle
down
quietly
as
an
english
country
gentleman
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
old
bolton
was
a
little
jealous
and
perhaps
in
some
degree
incredulous
as
to
the
success
of
john
caldigate
his
sons
had
worked
hard
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
lives
with
them
there
had
been
no
period
of
newmarket
davis
and
disreputation
on
the
basis
of
capital
combined
with
conduct
they
had
gradually
risen
to
high
success
but
here
was
a
young
man
who
having
by
his
thrown
away
all
the
prospects
of
his
youth
had
rehabilitated
himself
by
the
luck
of
finding
gold
in
a
gully
to
bolton
it
was
no
better
than
had
he
found
a
box
of
treasure
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
bolton
had
himself
been
a
seeker
of
money
all
his
life
but
he
had
his
prejudices
as
to
the
way
in
which
money
was
to
be
sought
it
should
be
done
in
a
gradual
industrious
manner
and
in
accordance
with
recognised
forms
a
digger
who
might
by
chance
find
a
lump
of
gold
as
big
as
his
head
or
might
work
for
three
months
without
finding
any
was
to
him
only
one
degree
better
than
davis
and
therefore
he
did
not
receive
his
old
friend
statements
as
to
the
young
success
with
all
the
encouragement
which
his
old
friend
would
have
liked
but
his
father
was
very
enthusiastic
in
his
return
letter
to
the
miner
the
matter
as
to
the
estate
had
been
arranged
the
nephew
who
after
all
had
not
shown
himself
to
be
very
praiseworthy
had
already
been
compensated
his
own
will
had
already
been
made
of
course
in
his
son
favour
as
there
had
been
so
much
success
and
as
continued
success
must
always
be
doubtful
would
it
not
be
well
that
he
should
come
back
as
soon
as
possible
there
would
be
enough
now
for
them
all
then
he
expressed
an
opinion
that
such
a
place
as
nobble
could
not
be
very
nice
for
a
permanent
residence
nobble
was
not
very
nice
over
and
beside
his
professional
success
there
was
not
much
in
his
present
life
which
endeared
itself
to
john
caldigate
but
the
acquisition
of
gold
is
a
difficult
thing
to
leave
there
is
a
curse
about
it
or
a
blessing
it
is
hard
to
decide
which
that
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
tear
himself
away
from
its
pursuit
when
it
is
coming
in
freely
and
the
absolute
gold
not
the
money
not
the
balance
at
one
banker
not
the
plentiful
so
much
per
annum
but
the
absolute
metal
clinging
about
the
palm
of
one
hands
like
small
gravel
or
welded
together
in
a
lump
too
heavy
to
be
lifted
has
a
peculiar
charm
of
its
own
i
have
heard
of
a
man
who
having
his
pocket
full
of
diamonds
declared
as
he
let
them
run
through
his
fingers
that
human
bliss
could
not
go
beyond
that
sensation
john
caldigate
did
not
shoe
his
horse
with
gold
but
he
liked
to
feel
that
he
had
enough
gold
by
him
to
shoe
a
whole
team
he
could
not
return
home
quite
as
yet
his
affairs
were
too
complicated
to
be
left
quite
at
a
moment
notice
if
as
he
hoped
he
should
find
himself
able
to
leave
the
colony
within
four
years
of
the
day
on
which
he
had
begun
work
and
could
then
do
so
with
an
adequate
fortune
he
believed
that
he
should
have
done
better
than
any
other
englishman
who
had
set
himself
to
the
task
of
in
none
of
his
letters
did
he
say
anything
special
about
hester
bolton
but
his
inquiries
about
the
family
generally
were
so
frequent
as
to
make
his
father
wonder
why
such
questions
should
be
asked
the
squire
himself
who
was
living
hardly
a
dozen
miles
from
bolton
house
did
not
see
the
old
banker
above
once
a
quarter
perhaps
and
the
ladies
of
the
family
certainly
not
oftener
than
once
a
year
very
little
was
said
in
answer
to
any
of
john
inquiries
and
and
miss
bolton
are
i
believe
quite
well
so
much
was
declared
in
one
of
the
old
squire
letters
and
even
that
little
served
to
make
known
that
at
any
rate
so
far
no
tidings
as
to
marriage
on
the
part
of
hester
had
reached
the
ear
of
her
old
friend
perhaps
this
was
all
that
john
caldigate
wanted
to
learn
at
last
there
came
word
that
john
intended
to
come
home
with
the
next
month
mail
this
letter
arrived
about
midsummer
when
the
miner
had
been
absent
three
years
and
a
half
he
had
not
settled
all
his
affairs
so
completely
but
that
it
might
be
necessary
that
he
should
return
but
he
thought
that
he
would
be
able
to
remain
at
least
twelve
months
in
england
and
in
england
he
intended
to
make
his
home
gold
he
said
was
certainly
very
attractive
but
he
did
not
like
new
south
wales
as
a
country
in
which
to
live
he
had
now
contracted
his
ventures
to
the
one
enterprise
of
the
polyeuka
mine
from
which
he
was
receiving
large
monthly
dividends
if
that
went
on
prosperously
perhaps
he
need
not
return
to
the
colony
at
all
dick
shand
he
said
is
a
shepherd
far
away
in
the
west
hardly
earning
better
wages
than
an
english
ploughman
and
i
am
coming
home
with
a
pocket
full
of
money
a
few
glasses
of
whisky
have
made
all
the
difference
the
squire
when
he
received
this
felt
more
of
exultation
than
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
it
seemed
as
though
something
of
those
throbbings
of
delight
which
are
common
to
most
of
us
when
we
are
young
had
come
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
old
age
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
care
in
the
least
for
dick
shand
at
last
at
last
he
was
going
to
have
near
him
a
companion
that
he
could
love
yes
i
suppose
he
has
put
together
a
little
money
he
said
to
farmer
holt
when
that
worthy
tenant
asked
enthusiastically
as
to
the
truth
of
the
rumours
which
were
spread
about
as
to
the
young
success
rather
think
he
settle
down
and
live
in
the
old
place
after
all
what
he
ought
to
do
squoire
that
what
he
ought
to
do
said
holt
almost
choked
by
the
energy
of
his
own
utterances
chapter
xiv
again
at
home
on
his
arrival
in
england
john
caldigate
went
instantly
down
to
folking
he
had
come
back
quite
fortified
in
his
resolution
of
making
hester
bolton
his
wife
if
he
should
find
hester
bolton
willing
and
if
she
should
have
grown
at
all
into
that
form
and
manner
into
those
ways
of
look
of
speech
and
of
gait
which
he
had
pictured
to
himself
when
thinking
of
her
away
at
nobble
the
females
by
whom
he
had
been
surrounded
had
not
been
attractive
to
him
in
all
our
colonies
the
women
are
beautiful
and
in
the
large
towns
a
society
is
soon
created
of
which
the
fastidious
traveller
has
very
little
ground
to
complain
but
in
the
small
distant
as
they
are
called
the
rougher
elements
must
predominate
our
hero
though
he
had
worn
moleskin
trousers
and
jersey
shirts
and
had
worked
down
a
pit
twelve
hours
with
a
pickaxe
had
never
reconciled
himself
to
female
roughnesses
he
had
condescended
to
do
so
occasionally
telling
himself
that
it
was
his
destiny
to
pass
his
life
among
such
surroundings
but
his
imagination
had
ever
been
at
work
with
him
and
he
possessed
a
certain
aptitude
for
romance
which
told
him
continually
that
hester
bolton
was
the
dream
of
his
life
and
ought
to
become
if
possible
the
reality
and
now
he
came
back
resolved
to
attempt
the
reality
unless
he
should
find
that
the
hester
bolton
of
chesterton
was
altogether
different
from
the
hester
bolton
of
his
dreams
the
fatted
calf
was
killed
for
him
in
a
very
simple
but
way
there
was
no
other
guest
to
witness
the
meeting
here
you
are
said
the
father
sir
here
i
am
all
that
left
of
me
is
quite
plenty
said
the
father
looking
at
the
large
proportions
of
his
son
seems
but
a
day
or
two
since
you
went
and
yet
they
have
been
long
days
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
again
john
certainly
not
so
soon
as
this
certainly
not
in
such
circumstances
if
ever
a
man
was
welcome
to
a
house
you
are
welcome
to
this
and
now
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
yourself
nine
morning
you
will
probably
find
a
pit
opened
on
the
lawn
and
i
shall
be
down
to
the
middle
looking
for
gold
ah
sir
i
wish
you
could
have
known
poor
mick
maggott
he
would
have
made
holes
in
my
lawn
i
am
glad
he
did
not
come
home
with
you
this
was
the
first
conversation
but
both
the
father
and
son
felt
that
there
was
a
tone
about
it
which
had
never
before
been
heard
between
them
john
caldigate
at
this
time
was
so
altered
in
appearance
that
they
who
had
not
known
him
well
might
possibly
have
mistaken
him
he
was
now
nearly
thirty
but
looked
older
than
his
age
the
squareness
of
his
brow
was
squarer
and
here
and
there
through
his
dark
brown
hair
there
was
to
be
seen
an
early
tinge
of
coming
grey
and
about
his
mouth
was
all
the
decision
of
purpose
which
comes
to
a
man
when
he
is
called
upon
to
act
quickly
on
his
own
judgment
in
matters
of
importance
and
there
was
that
look
of
which
success
gives
he
had
thriven
in
all
that
he
had
undertaken
in
that
business
of
his
he
had
made
no
mistakes
men
who
had
been
at
it
when
a
boy
had
tried
to
cheat
him
but
had
failed
he
had
seen
into
such
mysteries
as
the
business
possessed
with
quick
glances
and
had
soon
learned
to
know
his
way
and
he
had
neither
gambled
nor
drank
which
are
the
two
rocks
on
which
are
apt
to
wreck
their
vessels
all
this
gave
him
an
air
of
power
and
which
might
perhaps
have
been
distasteful
to
an
indifferent
acquaintance
but
which
at
this
first
meeting
was
very
pleasing
to
the
father
his
son
was
somebody
had
done
something
that
son
of
whom
he
had
been
so
thoroughly
ashamed
when
the
dealings
with
davis
had
first
been
brought
to
light
he
had
kept
up
his
reading
too
had
strong
opinions
of
his
own
respecting
politics
regarded
the
colonies
generally
from
a
point
of
view
had
ideas
on
social
religious
and
literary
subjects
sufficiently
alike
to
his
father
not
to
be
made
disagreeable
by
the
obstinacy
with
which
he
maintained
them
he
had
become
much
darker
in
colour
having
been
as
it
seemed
bronzed
through
and
through
by
colonial
suns
and
colonial
labour
altogether
he
was
a
son
of
whom
any
father
might
be
proud
as
long
as
the
father
managed
not
to
quarrel
with
him
caldigate
who
during
the
last
four
years
had
thought
very
much
on
the
subject
was
determined
not
to
quarrel
with
his
son
asked
sir
the
other
day
what
i
meant
to
do
are
we
to
find
to
amuse
you
for
amusement
i
could
kill
rats
as
i
used
to
do
or
slaughter
a
hecatomb
of
pheasants
at
babington
here
the
old
man
winced
though
the
word
hecatomb
reconciled
him
a
little
to
the
disagreeable
allusion
it
has
come
to
me
now
that
i
want
so
much
more
than
amusement
what
do
you
say
to
a
farm
the
estate
and
the
landlord
at
once
began
to
think
whether
there
was
any
tenant
who
could
be
induced
to
go
without
injustice
three
times
as
big
as
the
estate
if
i
could
find
it
a
man
can
farm
five
thousand
acres
as
well
as
fifty
i
take
it
if
he
have
the
capital
i
should
like
to
cut
a
broad
sward
or
better
still
to
roam
among
many
herds
i
suppose
a
man
should
have
ten
pounds
an
acre
to
begin
with
the
difficulty
would
be
in
getting
the
land
but
all
this
was
said
half
in
joke
for
he
was
still
of
opinion
that
he
would
after
his
year
holiday
be
forced
to
return
for
a
time
to
new
south
wales
he
had
fixed
a
price
for
which
up
to
a
certain
date
he
would
sell
his
interest
in
the
polyeuka
mine
but
the
price
was
high
and
he
doubted
whether
he
would
get
it
and
if
not
then
he
must
return
he
had
not
been
long
at
folking
not
as
yet
long
enough
to
have
made
his
way
into
the
house
at
chesterton
before
annoyance
arose
shand
was
most
anxious
that
he
should
go
to
pollington
and
them
anything
about
poor
dick
they
did
in
truth
know
everything
about
poor
dick
that
poor
dick
money
was
all
gone
and
that
poor
dick
was
earning
his
bread
or
rather
his
damper
mutton
and
tea
wretchedly
in
the
wilderness
of
a
in
queensland
the
mother
letter
was
not
very
piteous
did
not
contain
much
of
complaint
alluded
to
poor
dick
as
one
whose
poverty
was
almost
natural
but
still
it
was
very
pressing
the
girls
were
so
anxious
to
hear
all
the
details
particularly
maria
the
details
of
the
life
of
a
drunken
sot
are
not
pleasant
tidings
to
be
poured
into
a
mother
ear
or
a
sister
and
then
as
they
two
had
gone
away
equal
and
as
he
john
caldigate
had
returned
rich
whereas
poor
dick
was
a
wretched
menial
creature
he
felt
that
his
very
presence
in
england
would
carry
with
it
some
reproach
against
himself
he
had
in
truth
been
both
loyal
and
generous
to
dick
but
still
there
was
the
truth
he
had
come
back
as
a
rich
man
to
his
own
country
while
dick
was
a
miserable
queensland
shepherd
it
was
very
well
for
him
to
tell
his
father
that
a
few
glasses
of
whisky
had
made
the
difference
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
this
to
the
large
circle
at
pollington
and
very
disagreeable
even
to
him
to
allude
to
it
and
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
discuss
the
subject
with
maria
with
that
closer
confidence
of
which
full
sympathy
is
capable
and
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
refuse
to
pay
the
visit
he
wrote
a
line
to
say
that
as
soon
as
he
was
at
liberty
he
would
run
up
to
pollington
but
that
at
present
business
incidental
to
his
return
made
such
a
journey
impossible
but
the
letter
or
letters
which
he
received
from
babington
were
more
difficult
to
answer
even
than
the
shand
despatch
there
were
three
of
them
from
his
uncle
from
aunt
polly
and
from
not
julia
but
second
sister
whereby
it
was
signified
that
julia
heart
was
much
too
heavily
laden
to
allow
her
to
write
a
simple
cousinly
note
the
babington
girls
were
still
babington
girls
would
still
romp
row
boats
and
play
cricket
but
their
condition
was
becoming
a
care
to
their
parents
here
was
this
cousin
come
back
unmarried
with
gold
at
command
not
only
once
again
his
father
heir
but
with
means
at
command
which
were
not
at
all
diminished
by
the
babington
imagination
after
all
that
had
passed
in
the
what
escape
would
there
be
for
him
that
he
should
come
to
babington
would
be
a
matter
of
course
the
real
kindness
which
had
been
shown
to
him
there
as
a
child
would
make
it
impossible
that
he
should
refuse
caldigate
did
feel
it
to
be
impossible
to
refuse
though
aunt
polly
had
on
that
last
occasion
been
somewhat
hard
upon
him
had
laid
snares
for
him
and
endeavoured
to
catch
him
as
a
fowler
catches
a
bird
still
there
had
been
the
fact
that
she
had
been
as
a
mother
to
him
when
he
had
no
other
mother
his
uncle
too
had
supplied
him
with
hunting
and
shooting
and
fishing
when
hunting
and
shooting
and
fishing
were
the
great
joys
of
his
life
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
go
to
babington
probably
would
be
incumbent
on
him
to
pay
a
prolonged
visit
there
but
he
certainly
would
not
marry
julia
as
to
that
his
mind
was
so
fixed
that
even
though
he
should
have
to
declare
his
purpose
with
some
rudeness
still
he
would
declare
it
aunt
wants
me
to
go
over
to
babington
he
said
to
his
father
course
she
does
i
must
go
know
best
what
your
own
feelings
are
as
to
that
after
you
went
they
made
all
manner
of
absurd
accusations
against
me
but
i
do
wish
to
force
a
quarrel
upon
you
on
that
account
should
be
sorry
to
quarrel
with
them
because
they
were
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
boy
they
are
not
very
wise
do
think
i
ever
knew
such
a
houseful
of
fools
there
was
no
relationship
by
blood
between
the
squire
of
folking
and
the
squire
of
babington
but
they
had
married
two
sisters
and
therefore
babington
was
aunt
polly
to
john
caldigate
fools
may
be
very
worthy
sir
i
should
say
that
a
great
many
people
are
fools
to
you
to
me
especially
said
the
squire
almost
angrily
who
read
no
books
are
always
fools
to
those
who
do
read
deny
it
our
neighbour
over
the
water
the
middle
wash
was
always
called
the
water
at
folking
looks
at
a
book
as
far
as
i
know
and
he
is
not
a
fool
he
thoroughly
understands
his
own
business
but
your
uncle
babington
does
know
how
to
manage
his
own
property
and
yet
he
knows
nothing
else
that
what
i
call
being
a
fool
i
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
sir
secret
must
promise
to
keep
it
course
i
will
keep
it
if
it
ought
to
be
kept
want
me
to
marry
julia
cousin
julia
it
an
old
affair
perhaps
it
was
not
davis
only
that
made
me
run
away
five
years
ago
you
mean
they
asked
you
or
did
you
ask
her
i
did
not
ask
her
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
be
more
explicit
nevertheless
it
is
expected
and
as
i
do
not
mean
to
do
it
you
can
see
that
there
is
a
difficulty
would
not
go
near
the
place
john
must
you
have
to
marry
her
wo
there
be
a
quarrel
may
be
so
but
i
will
avoid
it
if
possible
i
must
go
i
could
not
stay
away
without
laying
myself
open
to
a
charge
of
ingratitude
they
were
very
kind
to
me
in
the
old
days
then
the
subject
was
dropped
and
on
the
next
morning
john
wrote
to
his
aunt
saying
that
he
would
go
over
to
babington
after
his
return
from
london
he
was
going
to
london
on
business
and
would
come
back
from
london
to
babington
on
a
day
which
he
named
then
he
resolved
that
he
would
take
pollington
on
his
way
down
knowing
that
a
disagreeable
thing
to
be
done
is
a
lion
in
one
path
which
should
be
encountered
and
conquered
as
soon
as
possible
but
there
was
one
visit
which
he
must
pay
before
he
went
up
to
london
think
i
shall
ride
over
and
call
on
the
boltons
he
said
to
his
father
course
you
can
do
that
if
you
please
was
a
little
rough
to
me
but
he
was
kind
i
stayed
a
night
at
his
house
and
he
advanced
me
the
money
for
the
money
that
was
a
matter
of
business
he
had
his
security
and
in
truth
his
interest
he
is
an
honest
man
and
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
but
perhaps
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
has
always
been
a
little
hard
about
you
did
approve
of
davis
said
the
son
laughing
is
too
prejudiced
a
man
to
forget
davis
more
he
thinks
of
davis
the
better
he
think
of
me
if
i
can
make
him
believe
that
i
am
not
likely
to
want
a
davis
again
find
him
probably
at
the
bank
about
two
shall
go
to
the
house
it
would
be
civil
if
i
did
call
on
mrs
bolton
as
the
squire
was
never
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
house
at
chesterton
himself
and
as
bolton
was
a
lady
who
kept
up
none
of
the
outward
ceremonies
of
social
life
he
did
not
quite
understand
this
but
he
made
no
further
objection
on
the
following
day
about
five
in
the
afternoon
he
rode
through
the
iron
gates
which
he
with
difficulty
caused
to
be
opened
for
him
and
asked
for
bolton
when
he
had
been
here
before
the
winter
had
commenced
and
everything
around
had
been
dull
and
ugly
but
now
it
was
july
and
the
patch
before
the
house
was
bright
with
flowers
the
roses
were
in
full
bloom
and
every
morsel
of
available
soil
was
bedded
out
with
geraniums
as
he
stood
holding
his
horse
by
the
rein
while
he
rang
the
bell
a
leading
through
the
high
brick
wall
from
the
garden
which
stretched
away
behind
the
house
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
lady
came
through
with
a
garden
hat
on
and
garden
gloves
and
a
basket
full
of
rose
leaves
in
her
hand
it
was
the
lady
of
whom
he
had
never
ceased
to
think
from
the
day
on
which
he
had
been
allowed
just
to
touch
her
fingers
now
five
years
ago
it
was
she
of
course
whom
he
had
come
to
see
and
there
she
was
to
be
seen
it
was
of
her
that
he
had
come
to
form
a
judgment
to
tell
himself
whether
she
was
or
was
not
such
as
he
had
dreamed
her
to
be
he
had
not
been
so
foolishly
romantic
as
to
have
been
unaware
that
in
all
probability
she
might
have
grown
up
to
be
something
very
different
from
that
which
his
fancy
had
depicted
it
might
or
it
might
not
come
to
pass
that
that
promise
of
loveliness
of
loveliness
combined
with
innocence
and
full
intelligence
should
be
kept
how
often
it
is
that
nature
is
unkind
to
a
girl
as
she
grows
into
womanhood
and
robs
the
attractive
child
of
her
charms
how
often
will
the
sparkle
of
early
youth
get
itself
quenched
utterly
by
the
dampness
and
clouds
of
the
opening
world
he
knew
all
that
and
knew
too
that
he
had
only
just
seen
her
had
barely
heard
the
voice
which
had
sounded
so
silvery
sweet
in
his
ears
but
there
she
was
to
be
seen
again
to
be
heard
if
possible
and
to
receive
his
judgment
bolton
he
said
coming
down
the
stone
steps
which
he
had
ascended
that
he
might
ring
the
bell
and
offering
her
his
hand
caldigate
remember
me
then
yes
i
remember
you
very
well
i
do
not
see
people
often
enough
to
forget
them
and
papa
said
that
you
were
coming
home
have
come
at
once
to
call
upon
your
mother
and
your
father
and
upon
you
i
have
to
thank
him
for
great
kindness
to
me
before
i
went
mamma
is
not
quite
well
said
the
daughter
has
headaches
so
often
and
she
has
one
now
and
papa
has
not
come
back
from
the
bank
i
have
been
gardening
and
am
all
then
she
stopped
and
blushed
as
though
ashamed
of
herself
for
saying
so
much
am
sorry
bolton
is
unwell
i
will
not
go
the
ceremony
of
leaving
a
card
as
i
hope
to
able
to
come
again
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
before
i
went
on
my
travels
will
you
tell
your
father
that
i
called
then
he
mounted
his
horse
feeling
as
he
did
so
that
he
was
throwing
away
an
opportunity
which
kind
fortune
had
given
him
there
they
were
together
he
and
this
girl
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
and
now
he
was
leaving
her
because
he
did
not
know
how
to
hold
her
in
conversation
for
ten
minutes
but
it
was
true
and
he
had
to
leave
her
he
could
not
instantly
tell
her
how
he
admired
her
how
he
loved
her
how
he
had
thought
of
her
and
how
completely
she
had
realised
all
his
fondest
dreams
when
on
his
horse
he
turned
round
and
lifting
his
hat
to
her
took
a
last
glance
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
he
said
to
himself
he
had
been
sure
that
she
would
grow
up
to
be
exactly
that
which
he
had
found
her
to
have
supposed
that
nature
could
have
been
untrue
to
such
promises
as
had
been
made
then
would
have
been
to
suppose
nature
a
liar
just
outside
the
gate
he
met
the
old
banker
who
according
to
his
daily
custom
had
walked
back
from
the
town
said
bolton
remember
you
i
remember
you
very
well
so
you
found
a
lot
of
gold
got
some
have
been
one
of
the
few
fortunate
i
hear
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
keep
it
and
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
my
compliments
to
your
father
good
evening
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
of
paying
my
respects
again
to
bolton
who
i
am
sorry
to
hear
is
not
well
enough
to
see
me
said
caldigate
preventing
the
old
curmudgeon
from
escaping
with
his
intended
rapidity
is
unfortunately
often
an
invalid
sir
and
feels
therefore
that
she
has
no
right
to
exact
from
any
one
the
ceremony
of
morning
visits
good
evening
sir
but
he
cared
not
much
for
this
coldness
having
found
where
the
gold
lay
at
this
second
ahalala
that
the
gold
was
real
gold
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
good
his
mining
operations
chapter
xv
again
at
pollington
on
his
arrival
at
pollington
all
the
shands
welcomed
him
as
though
he
had
been
the
successful
son
or
successful
brother
who
had
gone
out
from
among
them
and
spoke
of
dick
as
being
the
unsuccessful
son
or
unsuccessful
brother
as
indeed
he
was
there
did
not
seem
to
be
the
slightest
anger
against
him
in
that
he
had
thriven
and
had
left
dick
behind
him
in
such
wretched
poverty
there
was
no
just
ground
for
anger
indeed
he
was
well
aware
of
that
he
had
done
his
duty
by
dick
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
fathers
and
mothers
are
sometimes
apt
to
think
that
more
should
be
done
for
their
own
children
than
a
friend
best
ability
can
afford
these
people
however
were
reasonable
dick
it
sad
suppose
when
he
quite
far
away
in
the
bush
like
that
he
ca
get
it
by
which
last
miserable
shred
of
security
the
poor
mother
allowed
herself
to
be
in
some
degree
comforted
i
want
you
to
tell
me
said
the
father
when
they
were
alone
together
on
the
first
evening
is
really
his
condition
was
a
shepherd
when
i
last
heard
about
him
wrote
to
his
mother
by
the
last
mail
asking
whether
something
can
not
be
done
for
him
he
was
a
shepherd
then
what
is
a
shepherd
man
who
goes
about
with
the
sheep
all
day
and
brings
them
up
to
a
camp
at
night
he
may
probably
be
a
week
without
seeing
a
human
being
that
is
the
worst
of
it
is
he
fed
is
brought
out
to
his
hut
perhaps
once
a
week
perhaps
once
a
fortnight
so
much
meat
so
much
flour
so
much
tea
and
so
much
sugar
and
he
has
thirty
or
pounds
besides
weekly
perhaps
quarterly
perhaps
he
can
do
nothing
with
his
money
as
long
as
he
is
there
if
he
wants
a
pair
of
boots
or
a
new
shirt
they
send
it
out
to
him
from
the
store
and
his
employer
charges
him
with
the
price
it
is
a
poor
life
sir
poor
now
tell
me
what
can
we
do
for
him
is
an
affair
of
money
is
it
an
affair
of
money
caldigate
is
it
not
rather
an
affair
of
drink
he
has
had
his
money
more
than
his
share
more
than
he
ought
to
have
had
but
even
though
i
were
able
to
send
him
more
what
good
would
it
do
him
this
was
a
question
very
difficult
to
answer
caldigate
had
been
forced
to
answer
it
to
himself
in
reference
to
his
own
conduct
he
had
sent
money
to
his
former
friend
and
could
without
much
damage
to
himself
have
sent
more
latterly
he
had
been
in
that
condition
as
to
money
in
which
a
man
thinks
nothing
of
fifty
pounds
that
condition
which
induces
one
man
to
shoe
his
horse
with
gold
and
another
to
chuck
his
about
like
the
condition
is
altogether
opposed
to
the
regulated
prudence
of
confirmed
wealth
caldigate
had
stayed
his
hand
in
regard
to
dick
shand
simply
because
the
affair
had
been
one
not
of
money
but
of
drink
suppose
a
man
may
be
cured
by
the
absence
of
liquor
the
enforced
absence
doubt
they
often
break
out
again
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
sir
if
you
think
that
money
will
do
good
money
that
is
in
moderation
i
will
advance
it
he
and
i
started
together
and
i
am
sometimes
aghast
with
myself
when
i
think
of
the
small
matter
which
like
the
point
on
a
railway
sent
me
running
rapidly
on
to
prosperity
while
the
same
point
turned
wrong
hurried
him
to
ruin
i
have
taken
my
glass
of
grog
too
my
two
glasses
or
perhaps
more
but
that
which
would
elate
him
into
some
fury
of
action
would
not
move
me
it
was
something
nature
did
for
me
rather
than
virtue
i
am
a
rich
man
and
he
is
a
shepherd
because
something
was
put
into
my
stomach
capable
of
digesting
bad
brandy
which
was
not
put
into
his
man
has
more
than
one
chance
when
he
found
how
it
was
with
him
he
should
have
abstained
a
man
must
pay
the
fine
of
his
own
weakness
yes
it
is
all
understood
somewhere
i
suppose
though
we
understand
it
i
tell
you
what
it
is
shand
if
you
think
that
five
hundred
pounds
left
with
you
can
be
of
any
assistance
you
can
have
it
but
the
doctor
seemed
to
doubt
whether
the
money
would
do
any
good
and
refused
to
take
it
at
any
rate
for
the
present
what
could
he
do
with
it
if
he
did
take
it
fear
that
he
must
lie
upon
his
bed
as
he
has
made
it
said
the
doctor
sorrowfully
is
a
complaint
which
money
can
not
cure
but
can
always
exaggerate
if
without
costing
myself
or
my
family
a
shilling
i
could
put
a
thousand
pounds
into
his
hands
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
do
it
will
remember
my
offer
the
doctor
thanked
him
and
said
that
he
would
remember
so
the
conversation
was
ended
and
the
doctor
went
about
the
ordinary
occupation
of
his
life
apparently
without
any
settled
grief
at
his
heart
he
had
done
his
duty
by
his
son
and
that
sufficed
or
almost
sufficed
for
him
then
came
the
mother
turn
could
anything
be
sent
to
the
poor
lost
one
to
poor
dick
clothes
ran
chiefly
in
her
mind
if
among
them
they
could
make
up
a
dozen
of
shirts
would
there
be
any
assured
means
of
getting
them
conveyed
safely
to
dick
out
in
the
queensland
bush
in
answer
to
this
caldigate
would
fain
have
explained
had
it
been
possible
that
dick
would
not
care
much
for
a
dozen
new
shirts
that
they
would
be
to
him
even
if
received
almost
as
little
a
source
of
comfort
as
would
be
a
ton
of
newcastle
coals
he
had
sunk
below
shirts
by
the
dozen
almost
below
single
shirts
such
as
shand
and
her
daughters
would
be
able
to
fabricate
some
upper
flannel
garment
and
something
in
the
nature
of
trousers
with
a
belt
round
his
middle
and
an
old
would
be
all
the
wardrobe
required
by
him
men
by
dint
of
misery
rise
above
the
need
of
superfluities
the
poor
wretch
whom
you
see
rolling
himself
as
it
were
at
the
corner
of
the
street
within
his
old
tattered
filthy
coat
trying
to
extract
something
more
of
life
and
warmth
out
of
the
last
glass
of
gin
which
he
has
swallowed
is
by
no
means
discomposed
because
he
has
no
clean
linen
for
the
morrow
all
this
caldigate
understood
thoroughly
but
there
was
a
difficulty
in
explaining
it
to
dick
shand
mother
think
there
would
be
some
trouble
about
the
address
he
said
you
must
know
so
many
people
out
there
have
never
been
in
queensland
myself
and
have
no
acquaintance
with
squatters
but
that
is
not
all
mrs
shand
else
you
can
tell
me
of
course
i
know
what
it
is
that
he
has
come
to
i
do
blind
myself
to
it
caldigate
even
though
i
am
his
mother
but
i
am
his
mother
and
if
i
could
comfort
him
just
a
little
are
not
what
he
wants
of
clothes
he
can
get
what
is
necessary
poor
as
he
is
is
it
he
wants
most
to
speak
to
some
one
to
be
kind
to
him
poor
boy
he
has
fallen
to
what
he
is
now
so
can
he
rise
again
if
he
can
find
courage
to
give
his
mind
to
it
i
think
that
if
you
write
to
him
and
tell
him
so
that
will
be
better
than
sending
him
shirts
the
doctor
has
been
talking
to
me
about
money
for
him
caldigate
he
could
drink
the
shirts
out
there
in
the
bush
here
where
there
is
a
at
all
the
corners
they
drink
everything
he
had
promised
to
stay
two
days
at
pollington
and
was
of
course
aware
of
the
dangers
among
which
he
walked
maria
had
been
by
no
means
the
first
to
welcome
him
all
the
other
girls
had
presented
themselves
before
her
and
when
at
last
she
did
come
forward
she
was
very
shy
the
eldest
daughter
had
married
her
clergyman
though
he
was
still
only
a
curate
and
the
second
had
been
equally
successful
with
lieutenant
postlethwaite
though
the
lieutenant
had
been
obliged
in
consequence
to
leave
the
army
and
to
earn
his
bread
by
becoming
agent
to
a
company
maria
shand
was
still
maria
shand
and
was
it
not
too
probable
that
she
had
remained
so
for
the
sake
of
that
companion
who
had
gone
away
with
her
darling
brother
dick
has
been
thinking
so
much
about
your
coming
said
the
youngest
not
the
girl
who
had
been
impertinent
and
before
for
she
had
since
become
a
miss
shand
and
had
a
young
attorney
of
her
own
on
hand
and
was
supposed
to
be
the
one
of
the
family
most
likely
to
carry
her
pigs
to
a
good
market
but
the
youngest
of
them
all
who
had
been
no
more
than
a
child
when
he
had
been
at
pollington
before
hope
she
is
at
home
said
caldigate
home
of
course
she
at
home
she
would
be
away
when
you
coming
the
shands
were
demonstrative
always
and
never
hypocritical
here
it
was
told
at
once
the
whole
story
he
was
to
atone
for
having
left
dick
in
the
lurch
by
marrying
maria
there
did
seem
to
him
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
justice
in
the
idea
but
then
unfortunately
it
could
not
be
carried
out
if
there
were
nothing
else
against
it
but
the
existence
of
the
young
lady
at
chesterton
that
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
and
then
though
maria
shand
was
very
well
though
no
doubt
she
would
make
a
true
and
loving
wife
to
any
husband
though
there
had
been
a
pretty
touch
of
feeling
about
the
still
still
she
was
not
all
that
he
fancied
that
a
wife
should
be
he
was
quite
willing
to
give
for
dick
but
after
that
he
thought
that
he
would
have
had
almost
enough
of
the
shands
he
could
not
marry
maria
and
so
he
must
say
plainly
if
called
upon
to
declare
himself
in
the
matter
there
was
an
easiness
about
the
family
generally
which
enabled
him
to
hope
that
the
difficulty
would
be
light
it
would
be
as
nothing
compared
with
that
coming
scene
between
himself
and
aunt
polly
perhaps
between
himself
and
his
uncle
babington
or
perhaps
worse
again
between
himself
and
julia
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
maria
in
the
on
the
following
morning
he
almost
thought
that
it
must
have
been
arranged
by
the
family
it
seem
almost
no
time
since
you
went
away
said
the
young
lady
has
gone
quickly
but
a
great
deal
has
been
done
suppose
so
poor
dick
indeed
poor
fellow
we
can
only
hope
about
dick
i
have
been
speaking
to
your
father
about
him
course
we
all
know
that
you
did
your
very
best
for
him
he
has
said
so
himself
when
he
has
written
but
you
you
have
been
fortunate
i
have
done
very
well
there
is
so
much
chance
at
it
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
proud
of
am
sure
there
is
a
great
deal
cleverness
and
steadiness
and
courage
and
all
that
we
were
delighted
to
hear
it
though
poor
dick
could
not
share
it
with
you
you
have
made
an
immense
fortune
dear
no
not
that
i
have
been
able
to
get
over
the
little
difficulties
which
i
left
behind
me
when
i
went
away
and
have
got
something
in
hand
to
live
upon
now
suppose
i
shall
go
back
again
said
caldigate
with
an
air
of
indifference
back
again
said
maria
who
had
not
imagined
this
but
still
a
man
going
back
to
australia
might
take
a
wife
with
him
she
would
not
object
to
the
voyage
her
remembrance
of
the
evening
on
which
she
had
crept
down
and
put
the
little
book
into
his
valise
was
so
strong
that
she
felt
herself
to
be
justified
in
being
in
love
with
him
not
for
always
not
but
just
to
wind
up
affairs
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
pleasant
and
perhaps
she
could
do
something
for
poor
dick
she
could
take
the
shirts
so
far
on
their
destination
caldigate
how
well
i
remember
that
last
night
indeed
do
i
and
the
book
the
hardship
upon
the
moth
is
that
though
he
has
already
scorched
himself
terribly
in
the
flame
and
burned
up
all
the
tender
fibre
of
his
wings
yet
he
ca
help
returning
to
the
seductions
of
the
till
his
whole
body
has
become
a
wretched
cinder
why
should
he
have
been
the
first
to
speak
of
the
book
of
course
she
blushed
and
of
course
she
stammered
but
in
spite
of
her
stammering
she
could
say
a
word
dare
say
you
never
looked
at
it
i
did
very
often
once
when
dick
saw
it
in
my
hands
he
wanted
to
take
it
away
from
me
dick
i
have
never
parted
with
it
for
an
hour
is
it
now
she
asked
said
caldigate
pulling
it
out
of
the
of
his
coat
if
he
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
say
that
he
had
lent
the
book
to
another
young
lady
and
that
she
had
never
returned
it
there
might
probably
have
been
an
end
of
this
little
trouble
at
once
but
when
the
little
volume
appeared
just
as
though
it
had
been
kept
close
to
his
heart
during
all
these
four
years
of
course
she
was
entitled
to
hope
he
had
never
opened
the
book
since
that
morning
in
his
cabin
not
caring
for
the
academic
beauties
of
thomson
had
never
looked
at
it
till
it
had
occurred
to
him
as
proper
that
he
should
take
it
with
him
to
pollington
now
he
brought
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
receive
it
from
him
are
not
going
to
take
it
back
again
not
if
it
be
of
any
value
to
you
you
not
value
the
presents
which
your
friends
make
you
i
care
for
the
friends
i
do
i
care
very
much
for
this
friend
i
shall
keep
the
book
do
think
that
can
be
true
mr
caldigate
he
was
painfully
near
the
blaze
determined
not
to
be
burned
and
yet
with
no
powers
of
flying
away
from
the
candle
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
not
true
i
have
kept
it
hitherto
it
has
been
with
me
in
many
very
strange
places
then
there
was
a
pause
while
he
thought
of
escaping
and
she
of
utilising
the
occasion
and
yet
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
be
unmaidenly
or
aggressive
only
if
he
did
like
her
it
would
be
so
very
nice
and
it
is
so
often
the
case
that
men
want
a
little
encouragement
dare
say
you
thought
more
of
the
book
than
the
donor
is
intended
to
be
unkind
certainly
not
i
can
never
be
unkind
to
a
friend
who
has
been
so
very
good
as
you
were
to
poor
dick
whatever
else
may
happen
i
shall
never
forget
that
by
this
time
there
was
a
faint
sound
of
sobbing
to
be
heard
and
then
she
turned
away
her
face
that
she
might
wipe
a
tear
from
her
eyes
it
was
a
real
tear
and
a
real
sob
and
she
really
thought
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
know
i
ought
not
to
have
come
here
he
said
not
she
asked
energetically
my
coming
would
give
rise
to
so
much
sadness
about
your
brother
am
so
glad
you
have
come
so
very
glad
of
course
we
wanted
to
hear
and
besides
besides
and
mamma
and
all
of
them
are
so
glad
to
see
you
we
never
forget
old
friends
then
again
there
was
silence
she
repeated
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
room
though
he
had
fluttered
flamewards
now
and
again
though
he
had
shown
some
aptitudes
he
had
not
shown
himself
to
be
a
downright
foolish
moth
determined
to
burn
himself
to
a
cinder
as
a
moth
should
do
and
she
she
was
weak
having
her
opportunity
at
command
she
went
away
and
left
him
because
she
did
not
know
what
more
to
say
she
went
away
to
her
own
bedroom
and
cried
and
had
a
headache
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
yet
there
was
no
other
day
late
that
evening
just
at
the
hour
when
on
the
previous
night
he
was
closeted
with
the
father
he
found
himself
closeted
with
the
mother
has
never
forgotten
you
for
one
moment
since
you
left
us
said
the
mother
shand
had
rushed
into
the
subject
so
quickly
that
these
were
almost
the
first
words
she
said
to
him
he
remained
quite
quiet
looking
out
from
the
open
window
into
the
moonlight
when
a
distinct
proposition
was
made
to
him
like
this
he
certainly
would
not
be
a
moth
do
know
whether
you
have
thought
of
her
too
mr
caldigate
he
only
shook
his
head
is
so
hope
you
do
not
think
that
i
have
been
to
blame
in
any
way
he
said
with
a
conscience
somewhat
stricken
for
he
remembered
well
that
he
had
kissed
the
young
lady
on
that
evening
four
years
ago
no
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
my
poor
child
it
is
a
pity
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
it
must
be
so
then
am
the
least
settled
man
in
all
the
world
mrs
shand
at
some
future
time
fear
not
my
mind
is
intent
on
other
things
so
it
was
intent
on
hester
bolton
but
the
statement
as
he
made
it
was
certainly
false
for
it
was
intended
to
deceive
shand
shook
hands
with
him
kindly
however
as
she
sent
him
away
to
bed
telling
him
that
breakfast
should
be
ready
for
him
at
eight
the
next
morning
his
train
left
pollington
at
nine
and
at
eight
the
doctor
with
all
his
family
were
there
to
greet
him
at
the
with
all
the
family
except
maria
the
mother
in
the
most
natural
tone
in
the
world
said
that
poor
maria
had
a
headache
and
could
not
come
down
they
filled
his
plate
with
eggs
and
bacon
and
toast
and
were
as
good
to
him
as
though
he
had
blighted
no
hopes
and
broken
no
heart
he
whispered
one
word
at
going
to
the
doctor
remember
that
whenever
you
think
the
money
can
be
of
use
it
is
there
i
consider
that
i
owe
him
quite
as
much
as
that
the
father
grasped
his
hand
and
all
of
them
blessed
him
as
he
went
i
can
only
get
away
from
babington
as
easily
he
said
to
himself
as
he
took
his
place
in
the
railway
carriage
chapter
xvi
again
at
babington
the
affair
of
julia
babington
had
been
made
to
him
in
set
terms
and
had
if
not
accepted
not
been
at
once
refused
no
doubt
this
had
occurred
four
years
ago
and
if
either
of
them
had
married
since
they
would
have
met
each
other
without
an
unpleasant
reminiscence
but
they
had
not
done
so
and
there
was
no
reason
why
the
original
proposition
should
not
hold
good
after
escaping
from
babington
he
had
indeed
given
various
reasons
why
such
a
marriage
was
impossible
he
had
sold
his
inheritance
he
was
a
ruined
man
he
was
going
out
to
australia
as
a
simple
miner
it
was
only
necessary
for
him
to
state
all
this
and
it
became
at
once
evident
that
he
was
below
the
notice
of
julia
babington
but
everything
had
been
altered
since
that
he
had
regained
his
inheritance
he
had
come
back
a
rich
man
and
he
was
more
than
ever
indebted
to
the
family
because
of
the
violent
fight
they
had
made
on
his
behalf
just
as
he
was
going
as
he
journeyed
to
babington
all
this
was
clear
to
him
and
it
was
clear
to
him
also
that
from
his
first
entrance
into
the
house
he
must
put
on
an
air
of
settled
purpose
he
must
gird
up
his
loins
seriously
he
must
let
it
be
understood
that
he
was
not
as
he
used
to
be
ready
for
worldly
lectures
from
his
aunt
or
for
romping
with
his
female
cousins
or
for
rats
or
rabbits
or
partridges
with
the
male
members
of
the
family
the
cares
of
the
world
must
be
seen
to
sit
heavy
on
him
and
at
the
very
first
mention
of
a
british
wife
he
must
declare
himself
to
be
wedded
to
polyeuka
at
babington
he
was
received
with
many
fatted
calves
the
whole
family
were
there
to
welcome
him
springing
out
upon
him
and
dragging
him
out
of
the
fly
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
the
park
gates
aunt
polly
almost
fainted
as
she
was
embracing
him
under
an
oak
tree
and
tears
real
tears
ran
down
the
squire
face
as
he
shook
both
his
nephew
hands
at
once
george
said
the
babington
heir
the
luckiest
fellow
i
ever
heard
of
we
all
thought
folking
was
gone
for
good
as
though
the
possessions
of
folking
were
the
summit
of
human
bliss
caldigate
with
all
the
girls
around
him
could
not
remonstrate
with
words
but
his
spirit
did
remonstrate
john
we
are
so
very
very
very
very
glad
to
have
you
back
again
said
julia
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
he
had
kissed
them
all
of
course
and
now
julia
was
close
to
his
elbow
as
he
walked
up
to
the
house
in
the
midst
of
all
this
there
was
hardly
opportunity
for
that
deportment
which
he
meant
to
exercise
when
fatted
calves
are
being
killed
for
you
by
the
dozen
it
is
very
difficult
to
repudiate
the
good
nature
of
the
slaughterers
little
efforts
he
did
make
even
before
he
got
to
the
house
hardly
know
how
i
stand
just
yet
he
had
said
in
answer
to
his
uncle
congratulations
as
to
his
wealth
must
go
out
again
at
any
rate
to
australia
asked
his
aunt
fear
so
it
is
a
kind
of
business
in
which
it
is
very
hard
for
a
man
to
know
what
he
worth
a
claim
that
has
been
giving
you
a
thousand
pounds
net
every
month
for
two
years
past
comes
all
of
sudden
a
great
deal
worse
than
valueless
you
ca
give
it
up
and
you
have
to
throw
back
your
thousands
in
profitless
work
would
do
that
said
the
squire
stick
to
what
i
got
said
the
babington
heir
is
a
very
difficult
business
said
caldigate
with
a
considerable
amount
of
deportment
and
an
assumed
look
of
age
as
though
the
cares
of
had
made
him
indifferent
to
all
the
lighter
joys
of
existence
you
mean
to
live
at
folking
asked
aunt
polly
should
think
probably
not
but
a
man
situated
as
i
am
never
can
say
where
he
means
to
live
you
are
to
have
folking
whispered
the
squire
whispered
it
so
that
all
the
party
heard
the
words
whispering
not
from
reticence
but
excitement
the
idea
at
present
said
the
folking
heir
polyeuka
is
so
much
more
to
me
than
folking
a
gold
mine
with
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
pounds
worth
of
plant
about
it
aunt
polly
is
an
imperious
mistress
in
all
this
our
hero
was
calumniating
himself
polyeuka
and
the
plant
he
was
willing
to
abandon
on
very
moderate
terms
and
had
arranged
to
wipe
his
hands
of
the
whole
concern
if
those
moderate
terms
were
accepted
but
cousin
julia
and
aunt
polly
were
enemies
against
whom
it
was
necessary
to
assume
whatever
weapons
might
come
to
his
hand
he
had
arranged
to
stay
a
week
at
babington
he
had
considered
it
all
very
deeply
and
had
felt
that
as
two
days
was
the
least
fraction
of
time
which
he
could
with
propriety
devote
to
the
shands
so
must
he
give
at
least
a
week
to
babington
there
was
therefore
no
necessity
for
any
immediate
violence
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
the
whole
week
might
probably
have
been
allowed
to
pass
without
absolute
violence
had
he
not
shown
by
various
ways
that
he
did
not
intend
to
make
many
visits
to
the
old
haunts
of
his
childhood
before
his
return
to
australia
when
he
said
that
he
should
not
hunt
in
the
coming
winter
that
he
feared
his
hand
was
out
for
shooting
that
he
had
an
idea
of
travelling
on
the
continent
during
the
autumn
and
that
there
was
no
knowing
when
he
might
be
summoned
back
to
polyeuka
of
course
there
came
across
aunt
mind
and
probably
also
across
julia
mind
an
idea
that
he
meant
to
give
them
the
slip
again
on
the
former
occasion
he
had
behaved
badly
this
was
their
opinion
but
as
it
had
turned
out
his
circumstances
at
the
moment
were
such
as
to
make
his
conduct
pardonable
he
had
been
harassed
by
the
importunities
both
of
his
father
and
of
davis
and
that
under
such
circumstances
he
should
have
run
away
from
his
affianced
bride
was
almost
excusable
but
now
it
was
very
different
now
something
must
be
settled
it
was
very
well
to
talk
about
polyeuka
a
man
who
has
engaged
himself
in
business
must
no
doubt
attend
to
it
but
married
men
can
attend
to
business
quite
as
well
as
they
who
are
single
at
any
rate
there
could
be
no
reason
why
the
previous
engagement
should
not
be
consolidated
and
made
a
family
affair
there
was
felt
to
be
something
almost
approaching
to
resistance
in
what
he
had
said
and
done
already
therefore
aunt
polly
flew
to
her
weapons
and
summoned
julia
also
to
take
up
arms
he
must
be
bound
at
once
with
chains
but
the
chains
were
made
as
soft
as
love
and
flattery
could
make
them
aunt
polly
was
almost
angry
was
prepared
to
be
very
angry
but
not
the
less
did
she
go
on
killing
fatted
calves
there
were
archery
meetings
at
this
time
through
the
country
the
period
of
the
year
being
unfitted
for
other
sports
it
seemed
to
caldigate
as
though
all
the
bows
and
all
the
arrows
had
been
kept
specially
for
him
as
though
he
was
the
great
toxophilite
of
the
age
whereas
no
man
could
have
cared
less
for
the
amusement
than
he
he
was
carried
here
and
was
carried
there
and
then
there
was
a
great
gathering
in
their
own
park
at
home
but
it
always
came
to
pass
that
he
and
julia
were
shooting
together
as
though
it
were
necessary
that
she
should
teach
him
that
she
should
make
up
by
her
dexterity
for
what
was
lost
by
his
awkwardness
that
she
by
her
peculiar
sweetness
should
reconcile
him
to
his
new
employment
before
the
week
was
over
there
was
a
feeling
among
all
the
dependants
at
babington
and
among
many
of
the
neighbours
that
everything
was
settled
and
that
miss
julia
was
to
be
the
new
mistress
of
folking
caldigate
knew
that
it
was
so
he
perceived
the
growth
of
the
feeling
from
day
to
day
he
could
not
say
that
he
would
not
go
to
the
meetings
all
of
which
had
been
arranged
beforehand
nor
could
he
refuse
to
stand
up
beside
his
cousin
julia
and
shoot
his
arrows
directly
after
she
had
shot
hers
nor
could
he
refrain
from
acknowledging
that
though
she
was
awkward
in
a
she
was
a
buxom
young
woman
dressed
in
green
with
a
feather
in
her
hat
and
a
bow
in
her
hand
and
then
she
could
always
shoot
her
arrows
straight
into
the
but
he
was
well
aware
that
the
new
hat
had
been
bought
specially
for
him
and
that
the
sharpest
arrow
from
her
quiver
was
intended
to
be
lodged
in
his
heart
he
was
quite
determined
that
any
such
shooting
as
that
should
be
unsuccessful
he
said
anything
the
mother
asked
the
daughter
a
word
this
occurred
on
the
sunday
night
he
had
reached
babington
on
the
previous
tuesday
and
was
to
go
to
folking
on
next
tuesday
a
word
the
reply
was
made
in
a
tone
almost
of
anger
julia
did
believe
that
her
cousin
had
been
engaged
to
her
and
that
she
actually
had
a
right
to
him
now
that
he
had
come
back
no
longer
ruined
men
never
do
said
aunt
polly
not
wishing
to
encourage
her
daughter
anger
just
at
present
men
are
never
left
alone
with
a
girl
for
half
a
moment
but
what
they
are
talking
stuff
and
nonsense
others
never
seem
to
think
about
it
in
the
least
but
whether
it
the
one
or
whether
it
the
other
it
makes
no
difference
afterwards
he
never
had
much
talk
of
that
kind
i
just
say
a
word
to
him
julia
the
saying
of
the
word
was
put
off
till
late
on
sunday
evening
sunday
was
rather
a
trying
day
at
babington
if
hunting
shooting
fishing
croquet
bow
and
arrows
battledore
and
with
every
other
game
as
games
come
up
and
go
constitute
a
worldly
kind
of
life
the
babingtons
were
worldly
there
surely
never
was
a
family
in
which
any
kind
of
work
was
so
wholly
out
of
the
question
and
every
amusement
so
much
a
matter
of
course
but
if
worldliness
and
religion
are
terms
opposed
to
each
other
then
they
were
not
worldly
there
were
always
prayers
for
the
whole
household
morning
and
evening
there
were
two
services
on
sunday
at
the
first
of
which
the
males
and
at
both
of
which
the
females
were
expected
to
attend
but
the
great
struggle
came
after
dinner
at
nine
when
aunt
polly
always
read
a
sermon
out
loud
to
the
assembled
household
aunt
polly
had
a
certain
power
of
her
own
and
no
one
dared
to
be
absent
except
the
single
servant
who
was
left
in
the
kitchen
to
look
after
the
fire
the
squire
himself
was
always
there
but
a
peculiar
chair
was
placed
for
him
supposed
to
be
invisible
to
the
reader
in
which
he
slept
during
the
whole
time
subject
to
correction
from
a
neighbouring
daughter
in
the
event
of
his
snoring
an
extra
bottle
of
port
after
dinner
was
another
sunday
observance
which
added
to
the
irritability
of
the
occasion
so
that
the
squire
when
the
reading
and
prayers
were
over
would
generally
be
very
cross
and
would
take
himself
up
to
bed
almost
without
a
word
and
the
brothers
would
rush
away
almost
with
indecent
haste
to
their
smoking
as
the
novels
had
all
been
put
away
into
a
cupboard
and
the
good
books
which
were
kept
for
the
purpose
strewed
about
in
place
of
them
and
as
knitting
and
even
music
were
tabooed
the
girls
having
nothing
to
do
would
also
go
away
at
an
early
hour
would
you
mind
staying
a
few
moments
with
me
said
aunt
polly
in
her
softest
voice
when
caldigate
was
hurrying
after
his
male
cousins
he
knew
that
the
hour
had
come
and
he
girded
up
his
loins
nearer
john
she
said
and
he
came
nearer
so
that
she
could
put
her
hand
upon
his
you
remember
john
when
you
and
i
and
julia
were
together
in
that
little
room
there
was
so
much
pathos
in
her
voice
she
did
her
acting
so
well
that
his
respect
for
her
was
greatly
augmented
as
was
also
his
fear
remembers
it
very
well
course
i
remember
it
aunt
polly
it
one
of
those
things
that
a
man
does
forget
man
ought
not
to
forget
such
a
scene
as
that
she
said
shaking
her
head
man
would
be
very
hard
of
heart
if
he
could
forget
it
now
must
be
the
moment
for
his
exertion
she
had
spoken
so
plainly
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
her
meaning
and
she
was
pausing
for
an
answer
yet
he
hesitated
not
in
his
purpose
but
doubting
as
to
his
own
manner
of
declaring
it
he
must
be
very
decided
upon
that
he
was
resolved
he
would
be
decided
though
they
should
drag
him
in
pieces
with
wild
horses
for
it
afterwards
but
he
would
fain
be
gentle
with
his
aunt
if
it
were
possible
dear
aunt
polly
it
wo
do
i
not
going
to
be
caught
and
so
you
may
as
well
give
it
over
that
was
what
he
wished
her
to
understand
but
he
would
not
say
it
in
such
language
much
was
due
to
her
though
she
was
struggling
to
catch
him
in
a
trap
i
had
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
before
i
went
about
money
he
said
thought
that
was
all
over
you
have
made
anything
but
a
fool
of
yourself
since
she
replied
triumphantly
have
gone
out
into
the
world
like
a
man
and
have
made
your
fortune
and
have
so
returned
that
everybody
is
proud
of
you
now
you
can
take
a
wife
to
yourself
and
settle
down
and
be
a
happy
goodman
it
was
exactly
his
view
of
life
only
there
was
a
difference
about
the
wife
to
be
taken
he
certainly
had
never
said
a
word
to
his
cousin
which
could
justify
this
attack
upon
him
the
girl
had
been
brought
to
him
in
a
cupboard
and
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
to
marry
her
and
that
when
he
had
been
young
and
drowned
with
difficulties
how
is
a
man
ever
to
escape
if
he
must
submit
under
such
circumstances
as
these
dear
aunt
polly
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
that
i
can
not
marry
my
cousin
julia
those
were
the
words
which
he
did
speak
and
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
look
about
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
which
ought
to
have
made
her
know
that
there
was
no
hope
why
not
john
caldigate
is
this
you
that
i
hear
should
i
you
promised
it
never
did
aunt
polly
because
she
loves
you
if
it
were
so
am
i
to
be
bound
by
that
but
indeed
indeed
i
never
even
suggested
it
never
thought
of
it
i
am
very
fond
of
my
cousin
very
fond
of
all
my
cousins
but
marriage
is
a
different
thing
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
cousins
had
better
not
marry
should
have
said
that
before
but
it
is
nonsense
cousins
marry
every
day
there
is
nothing
about
it
either
in
the
bible
or
the
she
will
die
aunt
polly
said
this
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
made
it
a
matter
of
regret
that
she
should
not
have
been
educated
for
drury
lane
but
as
she
said
it
he
could
not
avoid
thinking
of
julia
large
ankles
and
red
cheeks
and
of
the
new
green
hat
and
feather
a
girl
with
large
ankles
is
one
may
suppose
as
liable
to
die
for
love
as
though
she
were
as
fine
about
her
feet
as
a
filly
and
there
is
surely
no
reason
why
a
true
heart
and
a
pair
of
cherry
cheeks
should
not
go
together
but
our
imagination
has
created
ideas
in
such
matters
so
fixed
that
it
is
useless
to
contend
against
them
in
our
endeavours
to
produce
effects
these
ideas
should
be
remembered
and
obeyed
hope
not
on
that
account
said
caldigate
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
some
slightest
suspicion
of
a
smile
crossed
his
face
then
aunt
polly
blazed
forth
in
wrath
at
such
a
moment
as
this
you
can
laugh
i
did
not
laugh
i
am
very
far
from
laughing
aunt
polly
i
am
anxious
for
my
child
my
child
whom
you
have
deceived
you
make
yourself
merry
with
me
am
not
merry
i
am
miserably
unhappy
because
of
all
this
but
i
can
not
admit
that
i
have
deceived
my
cousin
all
that
was
settled
i
thought
when
i
went
away
but
coming
back
at
the
end
of
four
years
of
four
such
long
years
with
very
different
ideas
of
life
ideas
at
any
rate
with
ideas
of
having
my
own
way
i
can
not
submit
myself
to
this
plan
of
yours
which
though
it
would
have
given
me
so
much
would
give
you
everything
sir
but
i
can
not
take
everything
it
is
better
that
we
should
understand
each
other
so
that
my
cousin
for
whom
i
have
the
most
sincere
regard
should
not
be
annoyed
you
care
shall
i
say
signifies
nothing
what
you
say
you
are
a
false
man
you
have
inveigled
your
cousin
affections
and
now
you
say
that
you
can
do
nothing
for
her
this
comes
from
the
sort
of
society
you
have
kept
out
at
botany
bay
i
suppose
a
man
word
there
is
worth
nothing
and
that
the
women
are
of
such
a
kind
they
do
mind
it
it
is
not
the
way
with
gentlemen
here
in
england
let
me
tell
you
that
then
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
leaving
him
either
to
go
to
bed
or
join
the
smokers
or
to
sit
still
and
repent
at
his
leisure
as
he
might
please
his
mind
however
was
chiefly
occupied
for
the
next
with
thinking
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
escape
from
babington
on
the
following
morning
before
the
morning
he
had
resolved
that
let
the
torment
of
the
day
be
what
it
might
he
would
bear
it
unless
by
chance
he
might
be
turned
out
of
the
house
but
no
tragedy
such
as
that
came
to
relieve
him
aunt
polly
gave
him
his
tea
at
breakfast
with
a
sternly
forbidding
look
and
julia
was
as
as
ever
though
very
silent
the
killing
of
calves
was
over
and
he
was
left
to
do
what
he
pleased
during
the
whole
day
one
spark
of
comfort
came
to
him
my
boy
said
his
uncle
in
a
whisper
the
matter
between
you
and
madame
babington
would
sometimes
call
his
wife
madame
when
he
was
half
inclined
to
laugh
at
her
caldigate
of
course
declared
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
the
squire
shook
his
head
and
went
away
but
from
this
it
appeared
to
caldigate
that
the
young
lady
father
was
not
one
of
the
conspirators
by
ascertaining
which
his
mind
was
somewhat
relieved
on
the
next
morning
the
fly
came
for
him
and
he
went
away
without
any
kisses
upon
the
whole
he
was
contented
with
both
his
visits
and
was
inclined
to
assure
himself
that
a
man
has
only
to
look
a
difficulty
in
the
face
and
that
the
difficulty
will
be
difficult
no
longer
chapter
xvii
again
at
puritan
grange
as
caldigate
travelled
home
to
folking
he
turned
many
things
in
his
mind
in
the
first
place
he
had
escaped
and
that
to
him
was
a
matter
of
he
had
declared
his
purpose
in
reference
to
his
cousin
julia
very
clearly
and
though
he
had
done
so
he
had
not
quarrelled
utterly
with
the
family
as
far
as
the
young
lady
father
was
concerned
or
her
brothers
there
had
been
no
quarrel
at
all
the
against
him
was
confined
to
the
women
but
as
he
thought
of
it
all
he
was
not
proud
of
himself
he
had
received
great
kindness
from
their
hands
and
certainly
owed
them
much
in
return
when
he
had
been
a
boy
he
had
been
treated
almost
as
one
of
the
family
but
as
he
had
not
been
quite
one
of
them
would
it
not
have
been
natural
that
he
should
be
absorbed
in
the
manner
proposed
and
then
he
could
not
but
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
been
deficient
in
proper
courage
when
he
had
been
first
caught
and
taken
into
the
cupboard
on
that
occasion
he
had
neither
accepted
nor
rejected
the
young
lady
and
in
such
a
matter
as
this
silence
certainly
may
be
supposed
to
give
consent
though
he
rejoiced
in
his
escape
he
was
not
altogether
proud
of
his
conduct
in
reference
to
his
friends
at
babington
would
it
not
have
been
better
that
he
should
have
told
his
aunt
frankly
that
his
heart
was
engaged
elsewhere
the
lady
name
would
have
been
asked
and
the
lady
name
could
not
have
been
given
but
he
might
in
this
way
have
prepared
the
way
for
the
tidings
which
would
have
to
be
communicated
should
he
finally
be
successful
with
hester
bolton
now
such
news
would
reach
them
as
an
aggravation
of
the
injury
for
that
however
there
could
be
no
remedy
the
task
at
present
before
him
was
that
of
obtaining
a
footing
in
the
house
at
chesterton
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
set
about
it
they
could
not
intend
to
shut
such
a
girl
up
through
all
her
young
years
as
in
a
convent
there
must
be
present
to
the
minds
of
both
of
them
an
idea
that
marriage
would
be
good
for
her
or
at
any
rate
that
she
should
herself
have
some
choice
in
the
matter
and
if
there
were
to
be
any
why
should
not
he
have
as
good
a
chance
as
any
other
when
they
should
learn
how
constantly
the
girl
image
had
been
present
to
his
mind
so
far
away
during
so
many
years
under
such
hard
circumstances
would
not
that
recommend
him
to
them
had
he
not
proved
himself
to
be
steady
industrious
and
a
good
man
of
business
in
regard
to
position
and
fortune
was
he
not
such
as
a
father
would
desire
for
his
daughter
having
lost
his
claim
to
folking
had
he
not
regained
it
and
in
doing
so
had
he
not
shown
himself
to
be
something
much
more
than
merely
the
heir
to
folking
an
immediate
income
would
of
course
be
necessary
but
there
was
money
enough
he
would
ask
the
old
man
for
nothing
reports
said
that
though
the
old
man
had
been
generous
to
his
own
sons
still
he
was
fond
of
money
he
should
have
the
opportunity
of
bestowing
his
daughter
in
marriage
without
being
asked
for
a
shilling
and
then
john
caldigate
bethought
himself
with
some
pride
that
he
could
make
a
proper
settlement
on
his
wife
without
burdening
the
estate
at
folking
with
any
dowers
but
of
what
use
would
be
all
this
if
he
could
not
get
at
the
girl
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
he
might
indeed
get
at
the
father
and
tell
his
purpose
plainly
and
honestly
but
he
thought
that
his
chance
of
prevailing
with
the
girl
might
be
better
than
with
the
father
in
such
cases
it
is
so
often
the
daughter
who
prevails
with
her
own
parents
after
she
has
surrendered
her
own
heart
the
old
man
had
looked
at
him
sternly
had
seemed
even
in
that
moment
of
time
to
disapprove
of
him
but
the
girl
well
in
such
an
interview
as
that
there
had
not
been
much
scope
for
approval
nor
was
he
a
man
likely
to
flatter
himself
that
any
girl
could
fall
in
love
with
him
at
first
sight
but
she
had
not
looked
sternly
at
him
in
the
few
words
which
she
had
spoken
her
voice
had
been
very
sweet
both
of
them
had
said
they
remembered
him
after
the
long
interval
that
had
passed
but
the
manner
of
saying
so
had
been
very
different
he
was
almost
sure
that
the
old
man
would
be
averse
to
him
though
he
could
tell
himself
personally
that
there
was
no
just
cause
for
such
aversion
but
if
this
were
so
he
could
not
forward
his
cause
by
making
his
offer
through
the
father
john
how
has
it
gone
with
you
at
babington
his
father
asked
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
together
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
tell
his
father
of
the
danger
before
he
made
his
visit
but
now
he
hesitated
before
he
could
avow
that
the
young
lady
hand
had
again
been
offered
to
him
well
sir
we
had
a
good
deal
of
archery
and
that
kind
of
thing
it
was
rather
slow
should
think
so
was
there
nothing
besides
the
archery
much
young
lady
was
not
troublesome
the
less
we
say
about
it
the
better
sir
they
were
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
boy
have
nothing
to
say
at
all
unless
i
am
to
be
called
on
to
welcome
her
as
a
will
not
have
to
do
that
sir
suppose
john
you
mean
to
marry
some
day
said
the
father
after
a
pause
then
it
occurred
to
the
son
that
he
must
have
some
one
whom
he
could
trust
in
this
matter
which
now
occupied
his
mind
and
that
no
one
probably
might
be
so
able
to
assist
him
as
his
father
wish
i
knew
what
your
idea
of
life
is
continued
caldigate
fear
you
will
be
growing
tired
of
this
place
and
that
when
you
get
back
to
your
you
will
stay
there
is
no
fear
of
that
i
do
not
love
the
place
well
enough
you
were
settled
here
i
should
feel
more
comfortable
i
sometimes
think
john
that
if
you
would
fix
yourself
i
would
give
the
property
up
to
you
altogether
and
go
away
with
my
books
into
some
town
cambridge
perhaps
would
do
as
well
as
any
other
must
never
do
that
sir
you
must
not
leave
folking
but
as
for
myself
i
have
ideas
about
my
own
life
they
such
that
you
can
tell
them
you
shall
hear
them
all
but
i
shall
expect
you
to
help
me
or
at
least
not
turn
against
me
against
you
john
i
hope
i
may
never
have
to
do
that
again
what
is
that
you
mean
this
he
said
very
seriously
there
was
usually
in
his
voice
something
of
a
tone
of
banter
a
subdued
cynicism
which
had
caused
everybody
near
him
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
which
even
yet
was
habitual
to
him
but
now
that
was
all
gone
was
there
to
be
any
new
source
of
trouble
betwixt
him
and
his
son
intend
to
ask
hester
bolton
to
be
my
wife
said
john
caldigate
the
father
who
was
standing
in
the
library
slapped
both
his
hands
down
upon
the
table
bolton
there
any
objection
do
you
know
about
her
why
she
a
child
is
nearly
twenty
sir
you
ever
seen
her
i
have
seen
her
twice
i
daresay
you
think
it
very
absurd
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
it
if
i
say
that
i
was
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
i
was
in
australia
of
course
you
will
laugh
at
me
will
not
laugh
at
you
at
all
john
any
one
else
were
to
say
so
to
me
i
should
laugh
at
them
but
yet
it
was
so
have
you
ever
seen
her
suppose
i
have
i
think
i
remember
a
little
girl
beauty
i
have
never
seen
anybody
equal
to
her
said
the
lover
wish
you
go
over
to
chesterton
and
judge
for
yourself
would
know
what
such
a
thing
meant
it
is
years
since
i
have
been
in
the
house
i
believe
that
bolton
devotes
herself
to
religious
exercises
and
that
she
regards
me
as
a
pagan
just
the
difficulty
sir
how
am
i
to
get
at
her
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
i
mean
to
do
it
if
i
were
beat
i
do
think
that
then
i
should
go
back
and
bury
myself
in
the
you
asked
me
what
i
meant
to
do
about
my
future
life
that
is
my
purpose
if
she
were
my
wife
i
should
consult
her
we
might
travel
part
of
the
time
and
i
might
have
a
farm
i
should
always
look
upon
folking
as
home
but
till
that
is
settled
when
you
ask
me
what
i
mean
to
do
with
my
life
i
can
only
say
that
i
mean
to
marry
hester
bolton
you
tell
them
at
babington
have
told
nobody
but
you
how
am
i
to
set
about
it
then
caldigate
sat
down
and
began
to
scratch
his
head
and
to
consider
do
suppose
they
ever
go
out
anywhere
do
think
they
do
except
to
church
ca
very
well
ask
her
there
you
can
always
knock
at
the
can
call
again
once
but
what
if
i
am
refused
then
it
is
of
no
use
knocking
if
a
man
does
not
get
in
after
a
little
more
conversation
the
squire
was
so
far
persuaded
that
he
assented
to
the
proposed
marriage
as
far
as
his
assent
was
required
but
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
give
any
assistance
he
could
only
suggest
that
his
son
should
go
direct
to
the
father
and
make
his
proposition
in
the
legitimate
fashion
but
when
it
was
put
to
him
whether
bolton
would
not
certainly
reject
the
offer
unless
it
were
supported
by
some
goodwill
on
the
part
of
his
own
daughter
he
acknowledged
that
it
might
probably
be
so
see
said
the
squire
believes
in
gold
but
he
does
believe
in
is
that
accursed
davis
that
stands
against
me
said
the
son
john
caldigate
no
doubt
had
many
things
to
trouble
him
before
he
had
resolved
on
making
his
second
visit
to
chesterton
he
received
a
most
heartrending
epistle
from
aunt
polly
in
which
he
was
assured
that
he
was
quite
as
dear
to
her
as
ever
quite
as
dear
as
her
own
children
and
in
which
he
was
implored
to
return
to
the
haunts
of
his
childhood
where
everybody
loved
him
and
admired
him
after
what
had
passed
he
was
determined
not
to
revisit
the
haunts
till
he
was
married
or
at
any
rate
engaged
to
be
married
but
there
was
a
difficulty
in
explaining
this
to
aunt
polly
without
an
appearance
of
ingratitude
and
then
there
were
affairs
in
australia
which
annoyed
him
tom
crinkett
was
taking
advantage
of
his
absence
in
reference
to
polyeuka
that
his
presence
would
soon
be
required
there
and
other
things
were
not
going
quite
smoothly
he
had
much
to
trouble
him
but
still
he
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
purpose
with
hester
bolton
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
roused
himself
to
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
he
had
ever
called
upon
himself
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
and
he
had
taught
himself
to
think
that
there
were
few
things
a
man
could
not
achieve
if
he
would
only
live
up
to
that
motto
therefore
though
he
was
perplexed
by
letters
from
australia
and
though
his
aunt
polly
was
a
great
nuisance
he
determined
to
persevere
at
once
if
he
allowed
himself
to
revisit
nobble
before
he
had
settled
this
matter
with
hester
bolton
would
it
not
be
natural
that
hester
bolton
should
be
the
wife
of
some
other
man
before
he
returned
with
all
this
on
his
mind
he
started
off
one
day
on
horseback
to
cambridge
when
he
left
folking
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
go
direct
to
the
bank
and
ask
for
old
bolton
or
make
a
first
attempt
at
that
fortified
castle
at
chesterton
but
on
entering
the
town
he
put
his
horse
up
at
an
inn
just
where
the
road
turns
off
to
chesterton
and
proceeded
on
foot
to
the
house
this
was
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
stable
and
as
he
walked
that
mile
he
resolved
that
if
he
could
get
into
the
house
at
all
he
would
declare
his
purpose
to
some
one
before
he
left
it
what
was
the
use
of
ever
did
anything
by
letting
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
so
he
knocked
boldly
at
the
door
and
asked
for
bolton
after
a
considerable
time
the
maid
came
and
told
him
apparently
with
much
hesitation
that
bolton
was
at
home
he
was
quite
determined
to
ask
for
miss
bolton
if
bolton
were
denied
to
him
but
the
girl
said
that
bolton
was
at
home
seeming
by
her
manner
to
say
at
the
same
time
can
not
tell
a
lie
about
it
because
of
the
sin
but
i
do
know
what
business
you
can
have
here
and
i
sure
that
my
mistress
does
not
want
to
see
any
such
a
one
as
you
nevertheless
she
showed
him
into
the
big
on
the
left
hand
of
the
hall
and
as
he
entered
he
saw
the
skirts
of
a
lady
dress
vanishing
through
another
door
had
there
been
a
moment
allowed
him
he
would
boldly
have
called
the
lady
back
for
he
was
sure
that
the
lady
was
hester
but
the
lady
was
gone
and
the
door
closed
before
he
could
open
his
mouth
then
he
waited
for
full
ten
minutes
which
of
course
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
much
more
than
an
hour
at
last
the
door
was
opened
and
bolton
appeared
the
reader
is
not
to
suppose
that
she
was
an
ugly
old
woman
she
was
neither
ugly
nor
old
nor
cross
when
she
had
married
bolton
she
had
been
quite
young
and
now
she
was
not
much
past
forty
and
she
was
handsome
too
with
a
fine
oval
face
which
suited
well
with
the
peculiar
simplicity
of
her
dress
and
the
sober
seriousness
of
her
gait
and
manner
it
might
perhaps
be
said
of
her
that
she
tried
to
look
old
and
ugly
and
cross
too
but
that
she
did
not
succeed
she
now
greeted
her
visitor
very
coldly
and
having
asked
after
old
caldigate
sat
silent
looking
at
john
caldigate
as
though
there
were
nothing
more
possible
for
her
to
say
could
not
but
come
to
see
you
and
thank
you
for
your
kindness
before
i
went
said
john
remember
your
coming
about
some
business
we
have
very
few
visitors
here
went
out
you
know
as
a
miner
think
i
heard
bolton
say
so
i
have
succeeded
very
well
indeed
well
that
i
have
been
able
to
come
back
and
though
i
may
perhaps
be
obliged
to
revisit
the
colony
to
settle
my
affairs
there
i
am
going
to
live
here
at
home
hope
that
will
be
comfortable
to
you
at
every
word
she
spoke
her
voice
took
more
and
more
plainly
that
tone
of
wonder
which
we
are
all
of
us
apt
to
express
when
called
on
to
speak
on
matters
which
we
are
at
the
moment
astonished
to
have
introduced
to
us
bolton
i
hope
it
will
and
now
i
have
got
something
particular
to
say
you
had
better
see
bolton
at
the
bank
hope
i
may
be
able
to
do
so
i
quite
intend
it
but
as
i
am
here
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
say
a
word
to
you
first
in
all
matters
there
is
nothing
so
good
as
being
explicit
she
looked
at
him
as
though
she
was
altogether
afraid
of
him
and
indeed
she
was
her
husband
opinion
of
the
young
man
had
been
very
bad
five
years
ago
and
she
had
not
heard
that
it
had
been
altered
since
young
men
who
went
out
to
the
colonies
because
they
were
ruined
were
to
her
thinking
the
worst
among
the
bad
men
who
drank
and
gambled
and
indulged
in
strange
lives
mere
castaways
the
adopted
of
satan
and
to
her
thinking
among
men
none
were
so
rough
as
miners
and
among
miners
none
were
so
godless
so
unrestrained
so
wild
as
the
seekers
after
gold
she
had
read
perhaps
something
of
the
spaniards
in
central
america
and
regarded
such
adventurers
as
she
would
pirates
and
freebooters
generally
and
then
with
regard
to
the
caldigates
generally
the
elder
of
whom
she
knew
to
have
been
one
of
her
husband
intimate
friends
in
his
less
regenerated
days
she
believed
them
to
be
infidel
freethinkers
she
was
not
therefore
by
any
means
predisposed
in
favour
of
this
young
man
and
when
he
spoke
of
his
desire
to
be
explicit
she
thought
that
he
had
better
be
explicit
anywhere
rather
than
in
her
may
remember
he
said
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
daughter
here
before
i
left
the
country
five
years
ago
then
she
listened
with
all
her
ears
there
were
not
many
things
in
this
empty
vain
hard
unattractive
world
which
excited
her
but
the
one
thing
in
regard
to
which
she
had
hopes
and
fears
doubts
and
resolutions
the
one
matter
as
to
which
she
knew
that
she
must
ever
be
on
her
guard
and
yet
as
to
which
she
hardly
knew
how
she
was
to
exercise
her
care
was
her
child
once
i
have
seen
her
since
i
have
been
back
though
only
for
a
moment
then
he
paused
as
though
expecting
that
she
should
say
something
but
what
was
it
possible
that
she
should
say
she
only
looked
at
him
with
all
her
eyes
and
retreated
a
little
from
him
with
her
body
as
anxious
to
get
away
from
a
man
of
his
class
who
should
dare
even
to
speak
to
her
of
her
girl
truth
is
bolton
that
her
image
has
been
present
to
me
through
all
my
wanderings
and
i
am
here
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
she
rose
from
her
chair
as
though
to
fly
from
him
and
then
sitting
down
again
stared
at
him
with
her
mouth
open
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
his
wife
her
hester
to
become
the
wife
of
such
a
one
as
that
her
girl
as
to
whom
when
thinking
of
the
future
life
of
her
darling
she
had
come
to
tell
herself
that
there
could
be
no
man
good
enough
pure
enough
true
enough
firm
enough
in
his
faith
and
life
to
have
so
tender
so
inestimable
a
treasure
committed
to
his
charge
chapter
xviii
robert
bolton
caldigate
felt
at
the
moment
that
he
had
been
very
abrupt
so
abrupt
as
to
have
caused
infinite
dismay
but
then
it
had
been
necessary
that
he
should
be
abrupt
in
order
that
he
might
get
the
matter
understood
the
ordinary
approaches
were
not
open
to
him
and
unless
he
had
taken
a
more
than
usually
rapid
advantage
of
the
occasion
which
he
had
made
for
himself
he
would
have
had
to
leave
the
house
without
having
been
able
to
give
any
of
its
inmates
the
least
idea
of
his
purpose
and
then
as
he
said
to
himself
matrimony
is
honest
he
was
in
all
worldly
respects
a
fit
match
for
the
young
lady
to
his
own
thinking
there
was
nothing
preposterous
in
the
nature
of
his
request
though
it
might
have
been
made
with
some
precipitate
informality
he
did
not
regard
himself
exactly
as
the
lady
regarded
him
and
therefore
though
he
saw
her
surprise
he
still
hoped
that
he
might
be
able
to
convince
her
that
in
all
that
he
was
doing
he
was
as
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
her
child
as
she
could
be
herself
she
sat
there
so
long
without
saying
a
word
that
he
found
himself
obliged
to
renew
his
suit
course
bolton
i
am
aware
how
very
little
you
know
of
me
at
all
she
answered
hurriedly
rather
too
much
he
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
perfectly
understanding
the
meaning
of
her
words
and
knowing
that
he
had
not
deserved
them
he
was
almost
angry
you
will
make
inquiry
i
think
you
will
find
that
i
have
so
far
succeeded
as
to
justify
you
in
hoping
that
i
may
be
able
to
marry
and
settle
myself
in
my
own
country
do
know
my
daughter
at
all
little
is
quite
out
of
the
question
she
is
very
young
and
such
a
thing
has
never
occurred
to
her
and
we
are
not
the
same
sort
of
people
not
bolton
your
husband
and
my
father
have
been
intimate
friends
for
a
great
many
years
it
is
not
as
though
i
had
taken
up
the
idea
only
yesterday
it
has
been
present
with
me
comforting
me
during
all
my
work
for
the
last
five
years
i
know
all
your
features
as
though
she
had
been
my
constant
companion
the
lady
shivered
and
almost
trembled
at
this
profanation
of
her
child
name
it
was
trouble
to
her
that
one
so
holy
should
ever
have
been
thought
about
by
one
so
unholy
course
i
do
not
ask
for
anything
at
present
but
will
you
not
consult
your
husband
as
to
the
propriety
of
allowing
her
to
make
my
acquaintance
shall
tell
my
husband
of
course
will
repeat
to
him
what
i
say
shall
tell
him
as
i
should
any
other
most
wild
proposition
that
might
be
made
to
me
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
will
be
very
angry
why
should
he
be
angry
then
she
stopped
do
not
think
bolton
that
there
can
be
any
cause
for
anger
if
i
were
a
beggar
if
i
were
below
her
in
position
if
i
had
not
means
to
keep
a
wife
even
if
i
were
a
stranger
to
his
name
he
might
be
angry
but
i
do
not
think
he
can
be
angry
with
me
now
because
in
the
most
straightforward
way
i
come
to
the
young
lady
parents
and
tell
them
that
i
love
their
child
is
it
a
disgrace
to
me
that
of
all
whom
i
have
seen
i
think
her
to
be
the
loveliest
and
best
her
father
may
reject
me
but
he
will
be
very
unreasonable
if
he
is
angry
with
me
she
could
not
tell
him
about
the
dove
and
the
kite
or
the
lamb
and
the
wolf
she
could
not
explain
to
him
that
he
was
a
sinner
unregenerated
a
wild
man
in
her
estimation
a
being
of
quite
another
kind
than
herself
and
therefore
altogether
unfitted
to
be
the
husband
of
her
girl
her
husband
no
doubt
could
do
all
this
if
he
would
but
then
she
too
had
her
own
skeleton
in
her
own
cupboard
she
was
not
quite
assured
of
her
own
husband
regeneration
he
went
to
church
regularly
and
read
his
bible
and
said
his
prayers
but
she
feared
she
was
almost
sure
that
he
liked
the
better
than
his
bible
that
he
would
reject
this
offer
from
john
caldigate
she
did
not
doubt
she
had
always
heard
her
husband
speak
of
the
man
with
disapprobation
and
scorn
she
had
heard
the
whole
story
of
davis
and
the
newmarket
debts
she
had
heard
too
the
man
subsequent
prosperity
spoken
of
as
a
thing
of
chance
as
having
come
from
gambling
on
an
extensive
scale
she
herself
regarded
money
acquired
in
so
unholy
a
way
as
likely
to
turn
to
or
to
fly
away
and
become
worse
than
nothing
she
knew
that
bolton
whether
regenerate
or
not
regarded
young
caldigate
as
an
adventurer
and
that
therefore
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
would
be
as
unpalatable
to
him
as
to
herself
but
she
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
visitor
that
he
was
an
unregenerate
kite
lest
her
husband
would
not
support
her
more
you
have
got
to
say
you
had
better
say
it
to
him
she
replied
to
the
lover
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
defence
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
gentleman
entered
the
room
this
was
robert
bolton
the
attorney
now
of
all
her
husband
sons
who
were
of
course
not
her
sons
bolton
saw
this
one
the
most
frequently
and
perhaps
liked
him
the
least
or
it
might
be
juster
to
say
that
she
was
more
afraid
of
him
than
of
the
others
the
two
eldest
who
were
both
in
the
bank
were
quiet
sober
men
who
lived
affluently
and
were
married
to
religious
wives
and
brought
up
their
children
plentifully
and
piously
she
did
not
see
very
much
of
them
because
her
life
was
not
a
social
life
but
among
her
friends
they
were
the
most
intimate
but
robert
wife
was
given
to
gaiety
and
and
had
been
seen
even
at
balls
and
robert
himself
was
much
oftener
at
the
grange
than
either
of
the
other
brothers
he
managed
his
father
private
affairs
and
was
perhaps
of
all
his
sons
the
best
liked
by
the
father
he
was
prosperous
in
his
business
and
was
reported
to
be
the
leading
lawyer
in
the
town
in
the
old
cambridge
days
he
had
entertained
john
caldigate
at
his
house
and
though
they
had
not
met
since
the
miner
return
from
australia
each
at
once
knew
the
other
and
their
greeting
was
friendly
hess
said
robert
asking
at
once
after
his
sister
is
engaged
robert
said
bolton
very
seriously
and
very
firmly
gave
me
a
commission
about
some
silk
and
margaret
says
that
it
ca
be
executed
in
cambridge
she
must
write
to
fanny
margaret
was
robert
bolton
and
fanny
was
the
wife
of
the
barrister
brother
who
lived
in
london
will
tell
her
robert
the
same
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
her
is
engaged
robert
this
was
said
almost
more
seriously
and
more
firmly
than
before
caldigate
said
the
attorney
turning
to
the
visitor
you
are
the
one
man
who
has
not
only
gone
to
the
gold
country
and
found
gold
but
has
brought
his
gold
home
with
him
have
brought
a
little
home
but
i
hope
others
have
done
so
before
have
never
heard
of
any
you
seem
to
have
been
uncommonly
lucky
hard
work
was
it
enough
at
first
a
good
deal
of
chance
a
man
will
work
steadily
and
has
backbone
enough
to
stand
up
against
reverses
without
consoling
himself
with
drink
and
if
when
the
gold
comes
he
can
refrain
from
throwing
it
about
as
though
it
were
endless
i
think
a
man
may
be
tolerably
sure
to
earn
something
then
he
told
the
story
of
the
horse
with
the
golden
shoes
of
gold
upon
a
horse
said
bolton
holding
up
both
her
hands
the
man
who
could
even
tell
such
a
story
must
be
an
adventurer
but
nevertheless
the
story
had
interested
her
so
that
she
had
been
enticed
into
taking
some
part
in
the
conversation
when
caldigate
got
up
to
take
his
leave
robert
bolton
offered
to
walk
back
to
the
town
with
him
he
had
expected
to
find
his
father
but
would
now
look
for
him
at
the
bank
they
started
together
and
as
they
went
caldigate
told
his
story
to
the
young
lady
it
occurred
to
him
that
of
all
the
family
robert
bolton
would
be
the
most
reasonable
in
such
a
matter
and
that
of
all
the
family
he
might
perhaps
be
the
best
able
to
give
assistance
when
robert
bolton
had
heard
it
all
at
first
he
whistled
then
he
asked
the
following
question
did
she
say
to
you
did
not
give
me
much
encouragement
should
think
not
though
i
say
it
who
should
hester
is
the
sweetest
girl
in
cambridgeshire
but
her
mother
thinks
her
much
too
good
to
be
given
in
marriage
to
any
man
this
kind
of
thing
was
bound
to
come
about
some
day
bolton
seems
to
have
some
personal
objection
to
me
probable
do
know
why
she
should
has
got
one
treasure
of
her
own
in
enjoying
which
she
is
shut
out
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
it
unnatural
that
she
should
be
a
little
suspicious
about
a
man
who
proposes
to
take
her
treasure
away
from
her
must
surrender
her
treasure
to
some
one
some
day
it
be
so
she
will
hope
to
do
so
to
a
man
of
whose
antecedents
she
may
know
more
than
she
does
of
yours
what
she
does
know
of
you
is
of
a
nature
to
frighten
her
you
will
excuse
me
of
course
has
heard
that
you
went
away
under
a
cloud
having
surrendered
your
estate
that
was
against
you
well
you
have
come
back
and
she
hears
that
you
have
brought
some
money
with
you
she
does
not
care
very
much
about
money
but
she
does
care
about
regularity
and
fixed
habits
if
hess
is
to
be
married
at
all
she
would
especially
wish
that
her
husband
should
be
a
religious
man
perhaps
you
are
am
neither
the
one
thing
nor
the
other
especially
therefore
peculiarly
dangerous
in
her
eyes
it
is
natural
that
she
should
oppose
you
am
i
to
do
then
how
am
i
to
answer
that
the
whole
story
is
very
romantic
and
i
do
not
know
that
we
are
a
romantic
family
my
father
is
autocratic
in
his
own
house
this
last
assurance
seemed
to
contain
some
comfort
as
bolton
would
be
his
enemy
in
the
matter
it
was
well
that
the
power
of
deciding
should
be
in
other
hands
do
not
mean
to
give
it
up
said
he
suppose
you
must
if
they
wo
open
their
doors
to
you
think
they
ought
to
allow
me
to
have
the
chance
of
seeing
her
do
see
why
they
should
mind
i
am
not
saying
anything
of
this
for
myself
if
i
were
my
sister
guardian
i
should
take
the
trouble
to
make
many
inquiries
before
i
either
asked
you
into
my
house
or
declined
to
do
so
i
should
not
give
access
to
you
or
to
any
other
gentleman
merely
because
he
asked
it
them
make
inquiry
bolton
probably
thinks
that
she
already
knows
enough
what
my
father
may
say
i
can
not
even
surmise
you
tell
him
you
wish
it
him
also
that
i
will
wait
upon
him
at
once
if
he
desires
it
he
shall
know
everything
about
my
affairs
which
indeed
require
no
concealment
i
can
settle
enough
upon
her
for
her
comfort
if
she
is
to
have
anything
of
her
own
that
will
be
over
and
above
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
myself
i
ask
no
question
about
that
i
think
that
a
man
ought
to
earn
enough
for
himself
and
for
his
wife
too
as
to
religion
i
were
you
i
would
leave
that
alone
said
the
lawyer
so
will
tell
my
father
that
is
all
i
can
say
so
they
parted
and
caldigate
getting
on
his
horse
rode
back
to
folking
looking
back
at
what
he
had
done
that
day
he
was
almost
disposed
to
be
contented
with
it
the
lady
too
evident
hostility
was
of
course
to
be
deprecated
but
then
he
had
expected
it
as
robert
bolton
had
explained
to
him
very
clearly
it
was
almost
impossible
that
he
should
at
the
first
be
regarded
by
her
with
favourable
eyes
but
he
thought
that
the
brother
had
been
quite
as
favourable
to
him
as
he
could
have
expected
and
the
ice
was
broken
the
bolton
family
generally
would
know
what
he
was
about
hester
would
not
be
told
of
course
at
any
rate
not
at
once
but
the
first
steps
had
been
taken
and
it
must
be
for
him
now
so
to
press
the
matter
that
the
ultimate
decision
should
be
made
to
rest
in
her
hands
as
soon
as
possible
did
bolton
say
to
you
asked
the
squire
did
not
see
him
what
did
the
young
lady
say
did
not
see
her
the
mamma
did
see
her
and
told
her
my
project
should
think
she
would
be
startled
was
not
very
propitious
sir
but
that
was
not
to
be
expected
is
a
poor
melancholy
creature
i
take
it
said
the
squire
least
that
is
what
i
hear
the
girl
i
should
think
would
be
glad
to
get
away
from
such
a
home
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
a
good
many
obstacles
after
that
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
matter
at
folking
for
some
days
but
there
was
a
great
deal
said
upon
the
matter
both
in
cambridge
and
at
chesterton
robert
bolton
found
his
father
at
the
bank
on
the
same
afternoon
and
performed
his
promise
he
see
your
asked
the
old
man
yes
and
as
far
as
i
can
understand
did
not
receive
very
much
favour
at
her
hands
he
did
not
see
hester
not
then
the
old
man
looked
up
into
his
son
face
as
though
seeking
some
expression
there
from
which
he
might
take
some
counsel
his
own
nature
had
ever
been
imperious
but
he
was
old
now
and
in
certain
difficulties
which
environed
him
he
was
apt
to
lean
on
his
son
robert
it
was
robert
who
encouraged
him
still
to
keep
in
his
hands
some
share
of
the
management
of
the
bank
and
it
was
to
robert
that
he
could
look
for
counsel
when
the
ceremonious
strictness
of
his
wife
at
home
became
almost
too
hard
even
for
him
is
natural
to
suppose
that
hester
should
be
married
some
day
said
the
lawyer
mother
will
never
wish
it
will
never
wish
it
at
any
given
moment
but
she
would
probably
assent
to
the
proposition
generally
why
not
hester
as
well
as
another
girl
it
is
the
happiest
life
for
women
am
not
sure
i
am
not
sure
think
so
themselves
and
hester
will
probably
be
the
same
as
others
she
will
of
course
have
an
opinion
of
her
own
will
be
guided
by
her
mother
altogether
it
will
only
be
fair
that
she
should
be
consulted
on
a
matter
of
such
importance
to
herself
would
not
tell
her
what
this
man
has
been
saying
necessarily
i
say
that
she
should
be
consulted
generally
as
to
her
future
life
in
regard
to
this
man
i
see
no
objection
to
him
if
he
be
a
good
man
was
here
at
college
you
know
what
he
did
then
and
i
know
too
something
of
what
he
has
done
since
he
went
away
disinherited
and
almost
degraded
he
has
come
back
as
i
hear
comparatively
a
rich
man
he
has
got
back
his
inheritance
which
might
probably
be
settled
on
his
children
if
he
were
to
be
married
and
all
this
he
has
done
off
his
own
bat
where
other
men
stumble
so
frequently
he
has
stood
on
his
legs
no
doubt
he
has
lived
with
rough
people
but
still
he
seems
to
be
a
gentleman
hester
will
be
well
off
no
doubt
some
day
will
have
something
something
said
the
old
man
this
suitor
asks
for
nothing
it
is
not
as
though
he
were
coming
to
you
to
prop
him
up
in
the
world
it
does
not
look
like
that
at
least
of
course
we
ought
to
make
inquiry
as
to
his
means
mortgage
has
been
paid
off
much
we
know
and
the
rest
may
be
found
out
i
do
not
mean
at
all
to
say
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
have
his
own
way
i
think
too
much
of
my
sister
for
that
but
in
this
matter
we
ought
to
regard
simply
her
happiness
and
her
welfare
and
in
considering
that
you
ought
to
be
prepared
for
her
coming
marriage
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
she
will
choose
to
give
herself
sooner
or
later
to
some
man
give
a
girl
good
looks
and
good
sense
and
good
health
and
she
is
sure
to
wish
to
be
some
man
wife
unless
she
be
deterred
by
some
conventual
superstition
if
there
were
any
words
capable
of
conveying
horror
to
the
mind
of
the
old
banker
they
were
convents
priests
and
papacy
of
which
the
lawyer
was
well
aware
when
speaking
thus
of
his
sister
bolton
was
certainly
not
addicted
to
papistical
observances
nor
was
she
at
all
likely
to
recommend
the
seclusion
of
her
daughter
in
a
convent
all
her
religious
doctrines
were
those
of
the
low
church
but
she
had
a
tendency
to
arrive
at
similar
results
by
other
means
she
was
so
afraid
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
that
she
would
fain
shut
up
her
child
so
as
to
keep
her
from
the
reach
of
all
evil
vowed
celibacy
was
abominable
to
her
because
it
was
the
resource
of
the
roman
catholics
and
because
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
were
screens
for
hiding
wickedness
but
yet
on
behalf
of
her
child
she
desired
seclusion
from
the
world
fancying
that
so
and
so
only
might
security
be
ensured
superstition
was
as
strong
with
her
as
with
any
nun
fasting
under
that
name
she
held
in
abhorrence
but
all
sensual
gratifications
were
wicked
in
her
sight
she
would
allow
all
home
indulgences
to
her
daughter
each
under
some
separate
plea
constrained
to
do
so
by
excessive
love
but
she
did
so
always
in
fear
and
trembling
lest
she
was
giving
some
foothold
to
satan
all
of
which
robert
bolton
understood
better
even
than
did
his
father
when
he
gave
the
above
advice
in
reference
to
this
lover
chapter
xix
men
are
so
wicked
a
month
had
passed
by
since
caldigate
interview
with
bolton
and
nothing
had
as
yet
been
decided
either
for
him
or
against
him
at
chesterton
and
the
fact
that
no
absolute
decision
had
been
made
against
him
may
be
taken
as
having
been
very
much
in
his
favour
but
of
those
who
doubted
and
doubting
had
come
to
no
decision
bolton
herself
was
by
no
means
one
she
was
as
firm
as
ever
in
her
intention
that
the
idea
should
not
even
be
suggested
to
her
daughter
nor
up
to
this
time
had
our
hero
name
been
even
mentioned
to
hester
bolton
about
a
week
after
caldigate
visit
to
chesterton
in
the
early
days
of
august
he
wrote
to
robert
bolton
saying
that
he
was
going
into
scotland
for
a
month
and
that
he
trusted
that
during
that
time
his
proposition
might
be
considered
on
his
return
he
would
take
the
liberty
of
calling
on
bolton
at
the
bank
in
the
meantime
he
hoped
that
inquiries
might
be
made
as
to
his
position
in
the
world
and
in
order
that
such
inquiries
might
be
effectual
he
gave
a
reference
to
his
man
of
business
in
london
to
this
letter
robert
bolton
sent
no
answer
but
he
went
up
to
london
and
did
make
the
inquiries
as
suggested
and
consulted
his
brother
the
barrister
and
his
the
barrister
wife
they
were
both
of
opinion
that
john
caldigate
was
behaving
well
and
were
of
opinion
also
that
something
should
be
done
to
liberate
hester
from
the
thraldom
of
her
mother
knew
how
it
would
be
when
she
grew
up
and
became
a
woman
said
william
bolton
will
be
allowed
to
see
her
and
she
wo
have
a
chance
of
settling
herself
when
we
asked
her
to
come
up
here
for
a
couple
of
months
in
the
season
bolton
sent
me
word
that
london
is
a
terrible
place
for
young
girls
though
of
course
she
knew
that
our
own
girls
were
being
brought
up
here
then
the
ways
of
bolton
at
chesterton
and
hester
future
life
generally
were
discussed
in
a
spirit
that
was
by
no
means
unfriendly
to
our
hero
the
suggested
inquiries
were
made
in
the
city
and
were
all
favourable
everyone
connected
with
the
mining
interests
of
the
australian
colonies
knew
the
name
of
john
caldigate
all
of
that
class
of
people
were
well
aware
of
his
prosperity
and
confirmed
he
had
brought
with
him
or
sent
home
nobody
quite
knew
how
much
money
but
it
was
very
well
known
that
he
had
left
his
interest
in
the
polyeuka
mine
to
be
sold
for
and
now
there
had
come
word
that
a
company
had
created
itself
for
the
sake
of
making
the
purchase
and
that
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
the
gentleman
in
the
city
connected
with
mining
matters
did
not
think
that
caldigate
would
be
called
upon
to
go
out
to
the
colony
again
unless
he
chose
to
do
so
for
his
own
pleasure
all
this
robert
bolton
learned
in
the
city
and
he
learned
also
that
the
man
as
to
whom
he
was
making
inquiry
was
held
in
high
esteem
for
honesty
perseverance
and
capacity
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
he
returned
to
cambridge
with
a
feeling
that
his
sister
ought
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
man
acquaintance
he
and
his
brother
had
agreed
that
something
should
be
done
to
liberate
their
sister
from
her
present
condition
love
on
the
part
of
a
mother
may
be
as
injurious
as
cruelty
if
the
mother
be
both
tyrannical
and
superstitious
while
hester
had
been
a
child
no
interference
had
been
possible
or
perhaps
expedient
but
the
time
had
now
come
when
something
ought
to
be
done
such
having
been
the
decision
in
harley
street
where
the
william
boltons
lived
robert
bolton
went
back
home
with
the
intention
of
carrying
it
out
this
could
only
be
done
through
the
old
man
and
even
with
him
not
without
great
care
he
was
devotedly
attached
to
his
young
wife
but
was
very
averse
to
having
it
thought
that
he
was
ruled
by
her
indeed
in
all
matters
affecting
his
establishment
his
means
and
his
business
he
would
hardly
admit
of
interference
from
her
at
all
his
worldly
matters
he
kept
between
himself
and
his
sons
but
in
regard
to
his
soul
he
could
not
restrain
her
and
sometimes
would
hardly
oppose
her
the
prolonged
evening
prayers
the
sermons
twice
the
two
long
church
services
on
sundays
indulgence
as
to
the
third
being
allowed
to
him
only
on
the
score
of
his
age
he
endured
at
her
command
and
in
regard
to
hester
he
had
hitherto
been
ruled
by
his
wife
thinking
it
proper
that
a
daughter
should
be
left
in
the
hands
of
her
mother
but
now
when
he
was
told
that
if
he
did
not
interfere
his
girl
would
be
constrained
by
the
harsh
bonds
of
an
unnatural
life
stern
as
he
was
himself
and
inclined
to
be
gloomy
little
as
he
was
disposed
to
admit
ideas
of
recreation
and
delight
he
did
acknowledge
that
something
should
be
done
to
relieve
her
when
i
die
she
must
be
left
in
her
mother
hands
said
the
old
banker
is
to
be
hoped
that
she
may
be
in
other
hands
before
that
replied
his
son
do
not
mean
to
say
anything
against
my
but
for
a
young
woman
it
is
generally
best
that
she
should
be
married
and
in
hester
peculiar
position
she
ought
to
have
the
chance
of
choosing
for
herself
in
this
way
something
almost
like
a
conspiracy
was
made
on
behalf
of
caldigate
and
yet
the
old
man
did
not
as
yet
abandon
his
prejudices
against
the
miner
a
man
who
had
at
so
early
an
age
done
so
much
to
ruin
himself
and
had
then
sprung
so
suddenly
from
ruin
to
prosperity
could
not
he
thought
be
regarded
as
a
steady
man
of
business
he
did
agree
that
as
regarded
hester
the
should
be
removed
but
he
did
not
think
that
she
should
be
invited
to
walk
forth
with
john
caldigate
robert
declared
that
his
sister
was
quite
able
to
form
an
opinion
of
her
own
and
boldly
suggested
that
hester
should
be
allowed
to
come
and
dine
at
his
house
meet
the
man
asked
the
banker
in
dismay
said
robert
is
an
ogre
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
i
shall
be
there
and
margaret
bring
her
yourself
if
you
are
afraid
of
anything
no
plant
ever
becomes
strong
by
being
kept
always
away
from
the
winds
of
heaven
to
this
he
could
not
assent
at
the
time
he
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
assent
without
consulting
his
wife
but
he
was
brought
so
far
round
as
to
think
that
if
nothing
but
his
own
consent
were
wanting
his
girl
would
be
allowed
to
go
and
meet
the
ogre
suppose
we
ought
to
wish
that
hester
should
be
married
some
day
he
said
to
his
wife
about
this
time
she
shuddered
and
dashed
her
hands
together
as
though
deprecating
some
evil
some
event
which
she
could
hardly
hope
to
avoid
but
which
was
certainly
an
evil
you
not
wish
that
yourself
she
shook
her
head
it
not
the
safest
condition
in
which
a
woman
can
live
shall
any
one
be
safe
among
the
dangers
of
this
world
nicholas
she
habitually
called
her
husband
by
his
christian
name
but
she
was
the
only
living
being
who
did
so
safe
then
said
he
is
the
natural
condition
of
a
woman
do
not
know
sin
is
natural
likely
no
doubt
but
marriage
is
not
sinful
are
so
wicked
of
them
are
is
there
one
that
is
not
steeped
in
sin
over
his
head
applies
to
women
also
does
it
said
the
banker
petulantly
he
was
almost
angry
because
she
was
introducing
a
commonplace
as
to
the
world
condition
into
a
particular
argument
as
to
their
future
life
which
he
felt
to
be
unfair
and
illogical
course
it
does
nicholas
we
are
all
black
and
grimed
with
sin
men
and
women
too
and
perhaps
something
more
may
be
forgiven
to
men
because
they
have
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
do
their
work
but
neither
one
nor
the
other
can
be
anything
but
foul
with
sin
except
except
he
was
quite
accustomed
to
the
religious
truth
which
was
coming
and
in
an
ordinary
way
did
not
object
to
the
doctrine
which
she
was
apt
to
preach
to
him
often
but
it
had
no
reference
whatever
to
the
matter
now
under
discussion
the
general
condition
of
things
produced
by
the
fall
of
adam
could
not
be
used
as
an
argument
against
matrimony
generally
wicked
as
men
and
women
are
it
is
so
evidently
intended
that
they
should
marry
and
multiply
that
even
she
would
not
deny
the
general
propriety
of
such
an
arrangement
therefore
when
he
was
talking
to
her
about
their
daughter
she
was
him
when
on
that
occasion
she
flew
away
to
her
discourse
the
use
then
of
saying
that
men
are
wicked
are
they
are
a
doubt
about
it
and
so
are
the
women
but
they
got
to
have
husbands
and
wives
they
would
be
any
the
better
if
there
were
no
marrying
we
have
to
suppose
that
hester
will
do
the
same
as
other
girls
hope
not
nicholas
why
not
are
vain
and
they
adorn
themselves
not
in
modest
apparel
as
paul
says
in
first
timothy
chapter
second
nor
with
and
sobriety
but
with
braided
hair
and
gold
and
pearls
and
costly
array
has
that
to
do
with
it
nicholas
might
be
married
without
all
those
things
said
you
wanted
her
to
be
like
other
girls
i
did
i
said
she
would
have
to
get
married
like
other
girls
you
do
want
to
make
a
nun
of
her
nun
i
would
sooner
sit
by
her
bedside
and
watch
her
die
my
hester
a
nun
well
then
let
her
go
out
into
the
world
world
nicholas
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
do
they
not
always
go
together
he
was
much
harassed
and
very
angry
he
knew
how
unreasonable
she
was
and
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
answer
her
and
she
was
dishonest
with
him
because
she
felt
herself
unable
to
advocate
in
plain
terms
a
thorough
shutting
up
of
her
daughter
a
protecting
of
her
from
the
temptation
of
sin
by
absolute
and
prolonged
sequestration
therefore
she
equivocated
with
him
pretending
to
think
that
he
was
desirous
of
sending
his
girl
out
to
have
her
hair
braided
and
herself
arrayed
in
gold
and
pearls
it
was
thoroughly
dishonest
and
he
understood
the
dishonesty
must
go
somewhere
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
and
closing
the
conversation
at
this
time
a
month
had
passed
since
caldigate
had
been
at
chesterton
and
he
had
now
returned
from
scotland
to
folking
on
the
following
day
hester
was
taken
out
to
dinner
at
the
nurseries
as
robert
bolton
house
was
called
was
taken
out
by
her
father
this
was
quite
a
new
experiment
as
she
had
never
dined
with
any
of
her
aunts
and
cousins
except
at
an
early
dinner
almost
as
a
child
and
even
as
a
child
not
at
her
brother
robert
but
the
banker
after
having
declared
that
she
must
go
somewhere
had
persisted
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
caldigate
was
on
this
occasion
invited
to
meet
her
nor
that
the
father
had
as
yet
agreed
that
any
such
meeting
should
be
allowed
but
as
william
bolton
the
london
brother
and
william
and
one
of
their
girls
were
down
at
cambridge
it
was
arranged
that
hester
should
meet
her
relatives
even
so
much
as
this
was
not
settled
without
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
hester
mother
there
was
nobody
at
the
house
but
members
of
the
family
the
old
banker
oldest
son
nicholas
was
not
there
as
his
wife
and
robert
did
not
get
on
well
together
nicholas
was
almost
as
strict
as
bolton
herself
and
having
no
children
of
her
own
would
not
have
sympathised
at
all
in
any
desire
to
procure
for
hester
the
wicked
luxury
of
a
lover
the
second
son
daniel
joined
the
party
with
his
wife
but
he
had
married
too
late
to
have
children
his
wife
was
strict
too
but
of
a
medium
strictness
teas
concerts
and
occasional
dinner
parties
were
with
her
permissible
as
were
also
ribbons
and
a
certain
amount
of
costly
array
nicholas
was
in
the
habit
of
telling
daniel
that
you
can
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
generally
intending
to
imply
that
robert
was
the
pitch
and
would
harp
on
the
impossibility
of
serving
both
god
and
mammon
thinking
perhaps
that
her
robert
and
mammon
were
one
and
the
same
but
daniel
who
could
go
to
church
as
often
as
any
man
on
sundays
and
had
thoroughly
acquired
for
himself
the
reputation
of
a
religious
man
of
business
had
his
own
ideas
as
to
proprieties
and
expediencies
and
would
neither
quarrel
with
his
brother
robert
or
allow
his
wife
to
quarrel
with
robert
so
that
the
nicholases
lived
very
much
alone
nicholas
and
bolton
might
have
suited
each
other
might
have
been
congenial
and
a
comfort
each
to
the
other
but
the
elder
son
and
the
elder
son
wife
had
endeavoured
to
prevent
the
old
man
second
marriage
and
there
had
never
been
a
thorough
reconciliation
since
there
are
people
who
can
never
forgive
nicholas
had
never
forgiven
the
young
girl
for
marrying
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
had
never
forgiven
the
opposition
of
her
elder
to
her
own
marriage
hence
it
had
come
to
pass
that
the
nicholases
were
extruded
from
the
family
conclaves
which
generally
consisted
of
the
daniels
and
the
roberts
the
williams
were
away
in
london
not
often
having
much
to
do
with
these
matters
but
they
too
allied
themselves
with
the
dominant
party
it
being
quite
understood
that
as
long
as
the
old
man
lived
robert
was
and
would
be
the
most
potent
member
of
the
family
when
the
father
and
the
three
sons
were
in
the
together
after
the
six
or
seven
ladies
had
left
them
the
propriety
of
allowing
john
caldigate
to
make
hester
acquaintance
was
fully
discussed
would
not
for
the
world
interfere
said
robert
i
did
not
think
it
unfair
to
the
dear
girl
that
she
should
be
shut
up
there
altogether
you
suppose
that
the
young
man
is
in
earnest
asked
daniel
as
to
this
they
all
agreed
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
was
too
an
old
family
friend
in
the
world
able
to
make
proper
settlements
and
not
at
all
greedy
as
to
a
fortune
with
his
wife
even
daniel
bolton
thought
that
the
young
man
should
have
a
chance
by
saying
which
he
was
supposed
to
declare
that
the
question
ought
to
be
left
to
the
arbitrament
of
the
young
lady
the
old
banker
was
unhappy
and
ill
at
ease
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
at
once
to
so
great
a
change
though
he
felt
that
the
excessive
fears
of
his
wife
if
indulged
would
be
prejudicial
to
their
girl
still
he
did
not
wish
to
thrust
her
out
into
the
world
all
at
once
could
there
not
be
some
middle
course
could
there
not
be
a
day
named
some
four
years
hence
at
which
she
might
be
allowed
to
begin
to
judge
for
herself
but
his
three
sons
were
against
him
and
he
could
not
resist
their
joint
influence
it
was
therefore
absolutely
decided
that
steps
should
be
taken
for
enabling
john
caldigate
to
meet
hester
at
robert
bolton
house
suppose
it
will
end
in
a
marriage
william
bolton
said
to
his
brother
robert
when
they
were
alone
course
it
will
she
is
the
dearest
creature
in
the
world
so
good
to
her
mother
but
no
fool
and
quite
aware
that
the
kind
of
restraint
to
which
she
has
been
subjected
is
an
injustice
of
course
she
will
be
gratified
when
a
man
like
that
tells
her
that
he
loves
her
he
is
a
fellow
with
a
fine
spirit
and
plenty
of
means
how
on
earth
can
she
do
better
mrs
said
william
who
would
sometimes
thus
disrespectfully
allude
to
his
will
do
all
she
can
to
prevent
it
said
robert
i
think
we
shall
find
that
hester
has
a
will
of
her
own
on
the
following
day
john
caldigate
called
at
the
bank
where
the
banker
had
a
small
wainscoted
appropriated
to
himself
he
had
already
promised
that
he
would
see
the
young
man
and
caldigate
was
shown
into
the
little
room
he
soon
told
his
story
and
was
soon
clever
enough
to
perceive
that
the
telling
of
his
story
was
at
any
rate
permitted
the
old
father
did
not
receive
him
with
astonishment
and
displeasure
combined
as
the
young
mother
had
done
of
course
he
made
difficulties
and
spoke
of
the
thing
as
being
beyond
the
bounds
of
probability
but
objection
no
stronger
than
that
may
be
taken
as
amounting
almost
to
encouragement
in
such
circumstances
and
he
paid
evident
attention
to
all
that
caldigate
said
about
his
own
pecuniary
affairs
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
declare
whether
he
would
give
his
daughter
any
fortune
at
all
on
her
marriage
is
quite
unnecessary
said
caldigate
will
probably
have
something
at
my
death
rejoined
the
old
man
when
may
i
see
her
asked
caldigate
in
answer
to
that
bolton
would
not
at
first
make
any
suggestion
whatsoever
falling
back
upon
his
old
fears
and
declaring
that
there
could
be
no
such
meetings
at
all
but
at
last
allowing
that
the
lover
should
discuss
the
matter
with
his
son
robert
i
may
have
been
mistaken
about
the
young
man
caldigate
the
banker
said
to
his
wife
that
night
nicholas
only
say
that
perhaps
i
may
have
been
mistaken
are
not
thinking
of
hester
said
nothing
about
hester
then
but
perhaps
i
may
have
been
mistaken
in
my
opinion
about
that
young
man
john
caldigate
john
caldigate
as
he
rode
home
after
his
interview
at
the
bank
almost
felt
that
he
had
cleared
away
many
difficulties
and
that
by
his
perseverance
he
might
probably
be
enabled
to
carry
out
the
dream
of
his
earlier
youth
chapter
xx
hester
courage
after
that
caldigate
did
not
allow
the
grass
to
grow
under
his
feet
and
before
the
end
of
november
the
two
young
people
were
engaged
as
robert
bolton
had
said
hester
was
of
course
flattered
and
of
course
delighted
with
this
new
joy
john
caldigate
was
just
the
man
to
recommend
himself
to
such
a
girl
not
too
light
not
too
prone
to
pleasure
not
contenting
himself
with
bicycles
cricket
matches
or
billiards
and
yet
not
wholly
given
to
serious
matters
as
had
been
those
among
whom
she
had
hitherto
passed
her
days
and
he
was
one
who
could
speak
of
his
love
with
soft
winning
words
neither
roughly
nor
yet
with
too
much
of
diffidence
and
when
he
told
her
how
he
had
sworn
to
himself
after
seeing
her
that
once
that
once
when
all
before
him
in
life
was
enveloped
in
doubt
and
difficulty
that
he
would
come
home
and
make
her
his
wife
she
thought
that
the
manly
constancy
of
his
heart
was
almost
divine
of
course
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
he
was
in
all
respects
one
made
to
be
loved
by
a
woman
and
then
what
else
had
she
ever
had
to
love
when
once
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
speak
to
her
the
thing
was
done
she
did
not
at
once
tell
him
that
it
was
done
she
took
some
few
short
halcyon
weeks
to
dally
with
the
vow
which
her
heart
was
ready
to
make
but
those
around
her
knew
that
the
vow
had
been
inwardly
made
and
those
who
were
anxious
on
her
behalf
with
a
new
anxiety
with
a
new
responsibility
redoubled
their
inquiries
as
to
john
caldigate
how
would
robert
bolton
or
robert
excuse
themselves
to
that
frightened
miserable
mother
if
at
last
it
should
turn
out
that
john
caldigate
was
not
such
as
they
had
represented
him
to
be
but
no
one
could
pick
a
hole
in
him
although
many
attempts
to
pick
holes
were
made
the
question
of
his
money
was
put
quite
at
rest
by
the
transference
of
all
his
securities
balances
and
documents
to
the
boltons
bank
and
the
for
polyeuka
was
accepted
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
that
he
should
go
again
to
the
colony
this
was
sweet
news
to
hester
when
she
first
heard
it
for
it
had
come
to
pass
that
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
marriage
should
be
postponed
till
his
return
that
having
been
the
one
concession
made
to
bolton
there
had
been
many
arguments
about
it
but
hester
at
last
told
him
that
she
had
promised
so
much
to
her
mother
and
that
she
would
of
course
keep
her
promise
then
the
arrangement
took
such
a
form
that
the
journey
was
not
necessary
or
perhaps
the
objection
to
the
journey
became
so
strong
in
caldigate
mind
that
he
determined
to
dispense
with
it
at
any
price
and
thus
very
greatly
to
the
dismay
of
bolton
suddenly
there
came
to
be
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
married
almost
at
once
but
there
was
an
attempt
made
at
the
picking
of
holes
or
rather
many
attempts
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
that
this
was
carried
on
by
bolton
herself
but
she
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
what
evil
things
were
said
to
her
nicholas
in
her
horror
at
the
general
wickedness
of
the
caldigates
almost
reconciled
herself
to
her
and
even
daniel
began
to
fear
that
a
rash
thing
was
being
done
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
old
story
of
davis
and
newmarket
robert
bolton
who
had
necessarily
become
the
advocate
and
defender
of
our
hero
generally
did
not
care
much
for
davis
and
newmarket
all
young
men
sow
their
wild
oats
of
course
he
had
been
extravagant
since
his
extravagance
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
an
industrious
sensible
steady
member
of
society
and
there
was
the
money
that
he
had
earned
what
young
man
had
earned
more
in
a
shorter
time
or
had
ever
been
more
prudent
in
keeping
it
davis
and
newmarket
were
easily
answered
by
a
reference
to
the
bank
account
did
he
ever
go
to
newmarket
now
though
he
was
living
so
close
to
it
on
that
matter
robert
bolton
was
very
strong
but
nicholas
had
found
out
that
caldigate
had
spent
certainly
two
sundays
running
at
folking
without
going
to
church
at
all
and
as
far
as
she
could
learn
he
was
altogether
indifferent
about
public
worship
bolton
who
could
never
bring
herself
to
treat
him
as
a
but
who
was
still
obliged
to
receive
him
taxed
him
to
his
face
with
his
paganism
you
no
religion
mr
caldigate
he
assured
her
that
he
had
and
fell
into
a
long
discussion
in
which
he
thoroughly
confused
her
though
he
by
no
means
convinced
her
that
he
was
what
he
ought
to
be
but
he
went
with
her
to
church
twice
on
one
sunday
and
showed
her
that
he
was
perfectly
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
place
but
perhaps
the
loudest
complaint
came
from
the
side
of
babington
and
here
two
sets
of
enemies
joined
their
forces
together
who
were
thoroughly
hostile
to
each
other
babington
declared
loudly
that
old
bolton
had
been
an
in
his
youth
and
that
his
father
had
been
a
porter
and
his
mother
a
washerwoman
this
could
do
no
real
harm
as
caldigate
would
not
have
been
deterred
by
any
such
rumours
even
had
they
been
true
but
they
tended
to
show
animosity
and
enabled
nicholas
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
babington
opposition
when
she
learned
that
john
caldigate
had
been
engaged
to
his
cousin
julia
of
course
she
made
the
most
of
it
and
so
did
bolton
and
in
this
way
it
came
to
be
reported
not
only
that
the
young
man
had
been
engaged
to
miss
babington
before
he
went
to
australia
but
also
that
he
had
renewed
his
engagement
since
his
return
do
not
love
her
do
you
hester
asked
him
then
he
told
her
the
whole
story
as
nearly
as
he
could
tell
it
with
some
respect
for
his
cousin
laughing
the
while
at
his
aunt
solicitude
and
saying
perhaps
something
not
quite
respectful
as
to
julia
red
cheeks
and
green
hat
all
of
which
certainly
had
not
the
effect
of
hardening
hester
heart
against
him
poor
young
lady
ca
help
it
if
her
feet
are
big
said
hester
who
was
quite
alive
to
the
grace
of
a
pair
of
boots
although
she
had
been
taught
to
eschew
braided
hair
and
pearls
and
gold
babington
however
pushed
her
remonstrances
so
far
that
she
boldly
declared
that
the
man
was
engaged
to
her
daughter
and
wrote
to
him
more
than
once
declaring
that
it
was
so
she
wrote
indeed
very
often
sometimes
abusing
him
for
his
perfidy
and
then
again
imploring
him
to
return
to
them
and
not
to
defile
the
true
old
english
blood
of
the
caldigates
with
the
suds
of
a
washerwoman
and
the
refuse
of
a
porter
shovel
she
became
quite
eloquent
in
her
denunciation
but
always
saying
that
if
he
would
only
come
back
to
babington
all
would
be
forgiven
him
but
in
these
days
he
made
no
visits
to
babington
then
there
came
a
plaintive
little
note
from
shand
of
course
they
wished
him
joy
if
it
were
true
but
could
it
be
true
men
were
very
fickle
certainly
but
this
change
seemed
to
have
been
very
very
sudden
and
there
was
a
word
or
two
prettily
written
in
another
hand
on
a
small
slip
of
paper
you
had
better
send
back
the
book
and
caldigate
as
he
read
it
thought
that
he
could
discern
the
smudge
of
a
tear
he
wrote
a
cheerful
letter
to
shand
in
which
he
told
her
that
though
he
had
not
been
absolutely
engaged
to
marry
hester
bolton
before
he
started
for
australia
and
consequently
before
he
had
ever
been
at
pollington
yet
his
mind
had
been
quite
made
up
to
do
so
and
that
therefore
he
regarded
himself
as
being
abnormally
constant
rather
than
fickle
tell
your
daughter
with
my
kindest
regards
he
added
i
hope
i
may
be
allowed
to
keep
the
book
the
babington
objections
certainly
made
their
way
in
cambridge
and
out
at
chesterton
further
than
any
others
and
for
a
time
did
give
a
hope
to
bolton
and
nicholas
and
made
robert
bolton
shrug
his
shoulders
uneasily
when
he
heard
all
the
details
of
the
engagement
in
the
but
there
came
at
one
moment
a
rumour
which
did
not
count
for
much
among
the
boltons
but
which
disturbed
caldigate
himself
more
than
any
of
the
other
causes
adduced
for
breaking
off
his
intended
marriage
word
came
that
he
had
been
very
intimate
with
a
certain
woman
on
his
way
out
to
melbourne
a
woman
supposed
to
be
a
foreigner
and
an
actress
and
the
name
of
cettini
was
whispered
he
did
not
know
whence
the
rumour
came
but
on
one
morning
robert
bolton
but
still
with
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
taxed
him
with
having
as
many
loves
as
lothario
is
cettini
asked
robert
bolton
said
caldigate
with
a
struggle
to
prevent
a
blush
you
travel
with
such
a
woman
at
least
if
that
was
her
name
i
did
not
hear
it
till
afterwards
a
very
agreeable
woman
she
was
say
that
you
promised
to
marry
her
when
on
board
they
lie
but
that
is
a
matter
of
course
there
are
so
many
lies
going
about
that
i
almost
feel
myself
to
be
famous
did
not
see
her
after
the
journey
i
did
i
saw
her
act
at
sydney
and
very
well
she
acted
have
you
anything
else
to
ask
robert
bolton
said
that
he
had
nothing
else
to
ask
and
seemed
at
the
moment
to
turn
his
mood
into
one
that
was
altogether
jocular
but
the
mention
of
the
name
had
been
a
wound
and
when
an
anonymous
letter
a
few
days
afterwards
reached
hester
herself
he
was
really
unhappy
hester
made
nothing
of
the
letter
did
not
even
show
it
to
her
mother
at
that
time
a
day
had
been
fixed
for
their
marriage
and
she
already
regarded
her
lover
as
nearer
to
her
than
either
father
or
mother
the
letter
purported
to
be
from
some
one
who
had
travelled
with
her
lover
and
this
woman
on
board
ship
and
declared
that
everybody
on
board
the
ship
had
thought
that
caldigate
meant
to
marry
the
woman
who
then
so
said
the
letter
called
herself
smith
hester
showed
the
letter
to
caldigate
and
then
caldigate
told
his
story
there
had
been
such
a
woman
who
had
been
much
because
of
her
poverty
he
had
certainly
taken
the
woman
part
she
had
been
clever
and
as
he
had
thought
and
no
doubt
there
had
been
a
certain
amount
of
friendship
he
had
seen
her
again
in
sydney
where
he
had
found
her
exercising
her
profession
as
an
actress
that
had
been
all
can
not
imagine
dear
he
said
you
should
be
jealous
of
any
woman
but
certainly
not
of
such
a
one
as
she
can
i
imagine
said
hester
stoutly
i
could
possibly
be
jealous
of
any
woman
and
then
there
was
nothing
more
said
about
the
woman
during
all
this
time
there
were
many
family
meetings
those
between
caldigate
the
father
and
old
bolton
were
pleasant
enough
though
not
peculiarly
cordial
the
banker
though
he
had
been
brought
to
agree
to
the
marriage
had
not
been
quite
reconciled
to
it
his
younger
son
had
been
able
to
convince
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
liberate
his
daughter
from
the
oppression
of
her
mother
and
all
the
rest
had
followed
very
quickly
overwhelming
him
as
it
were
by
stern
necessity
when
once
the
girl
had
come
to
understand
that
she
could
have
her
own
way
if
she
chose
to
have
a
way
of
her
own
she
very
quickly
took
the
matter
into
her
own
management
and
in
this
way
the
engagement
became
a
thing
settled
before
the
banker
had
realised
the
facts
of
the
position
though
he
could
not
be
cordial
he
endeavoured
to
be
gracious
to
his
old
friend
but
bolton
spoke
words
which
made
all
friendship
impossible
she
asked
old
caldigate
after
his
soul
and
when
he
replied
to
her
less
seriously
than
she
thought
becoming
she
told
him
that
he
was
in
the
bad
way
and
then
she
said
things
about
the
marriage
which
implied
that
she
would
sooner
see
her
daughter
in
her
grave
than
married
to
a
man
who
was
no
more
than
a
professing
christian
the
conversation
ended
in
a
quarrel
after
which
the
squire
would
not
go
again
to
puritan
grange
there
was
indeed
a
time
an
entire
week
during
which
the
mother
and
daughter
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
in
these
days
bolton
continually
demanded
of
her
husband
that
he
should
break
off
the
match
always
giving
as
a
reason
the
alleged
fact
that
john
caldigate
was
not
a
true
believer
it
had
been
acknowledged
between
them
that
if
such
were
the
fact
the
man
would
be
an
unfit
husband
for
their
daughter
but
they
differed
as
to
the
fact
the
son
had
over
and
over
again
declared
himself
to
be
a
faithful
member
of
the
church
of
england
not
very
scrupulous
perhaps
in
the
performance
of
her
ceremonies
but
still
a
believing
member
that
his
father
was
not
so
every
one
knew
but
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
father
bolton
seemed
to
think
that
the
argument
was
good
but
bolton
was
of
opinion
that
to
become
willingly
the
of
an
infidel
would
be
to
throw
oneself
with
one
eyes
open
in
the
way
of
perdition
hester
through
all
this
declared
that
nothing
should
now
turn
her
from
the
man
she
loved
though
he
were
an
infidel
himself
said
the
mother
said
hester
bravely
course
i
should
try
to
change
him
a
more
wretched
woman
than
bolton
might
not
probably
then
have
been
found
she
suddenly
perceived
herself
to
be
quite
powerless
with
the
child
over
whom
her
dominion
had
hitherto
been
supreme
and
she
felt
herself
compelled
to
give
way
to
people
whom
with
all
her
heart
she
hated
she
determined
that
nothing
nothing
should
induce
her
to
soften
her
feelings
to
this
who
was
forced
upon
her
the
man
had
come
and
had
stolen
from
her
her
treasure
her
one
treasure
and
that
other
man
whom
she
had
always
feared
and
always
hated
robert
bolton
the
man
whose
craft
and
worldliness
had
ever
prevented
her
from
emancipating
her
husband
from
the
flesh
and
the
devil
had
brought
all
this
about
then
she
reconciled
herself
to
her
child
and
wept
over
her
and
implored
heaven
to
save
her
hester
tried
to
argue
with
her
spoke
of
her
own
love
appealed
to
her
mother
asking
whether
as
she
had
now
declared
her
love
it
could
be
right
that
she
should
abandon
a
man
who
was
so
good
and
so
fondly
attached
to
her
then
bolton
would
hide
her
face
and
sob
and
put
up
renewed
prayers
to
heaven
that
her
daughter
might
not
by
means
of
this
unhappy
marriage
become
lost
to
all
sense
of
grace
it
was
very
miserable
but
still
the
prospect
of
the
marriage
was
never
abandoned
nor
postponed
a
day
had
been
settled
a
little
before
christmas
and
the
robert
boltons
would
allow
of
no
postponement
the
old
man
was
so
tormented
by
the
misery
of
his
own
home
that
he
himself
was
averse
to
delay
there
could
be
no
comfort
for
him
till
the
thing
should
have
been
done
bolton
had
suggested
that
it
should
be
put
off
till
the
spring
but
he
had
gloomily
replied
that
as
the
thing
had
to
be
done
the
sooner
it
was
done
the
better
it
had
been
settled
almost
from
the
first
that
the
marriage
festival
should
be
held
not
at
puritan
grange
but
at
the
nurseries
and
gradually
it
came
to
be
understood
that
bolton
herself
would
not
be
present
either
at
the
church
or
at
the
breakfast
it
was
in
vain
that
hester
implored
her
mother
to
yield
to
her
in
something
to
stand
with
her
at
any
rate
on
the
steps
before
the
altar
you
wish
me
to
go
and
lie
before
my
god
said
the
unhappy
woman
i
would
give
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
except
my
soul
my
life
my
name
even
my
child
herself
to
prevent
this
am
i
to
go
and
smile
and
be
congratulated
and
to
look
as
though
i
were
happy
there
was
therefore
very
much
unhappiness
at
the
grange
and
an
absence
of
all
triumph
even
at
the
nurseries
at
the
old
in
the
town
where
the
nicholases
lived
the
marriage
was
openly
denounced
and
even
the
daniels
though
they
were
pledged
to
be
present
were
in
doubt
suppose
it
is
all
right
said
robert
to
her
husband
course
it
is
all
right
why
not
seems
sad
that
such
an
event
as
a
marriage
should
give
rise
to
so
much
i
almost
wish
we
had
not
meddled
robert
do
think
there
is
anything
to
regret
remember
what
position
would
have
been
if
my
father
had
died
leaving
her
simply
to
her
mother
guardianship
we
were
bound
to
free
her
from
that
and
we
have
done
it
this
was
all
very
well
but
still
there
was
no
triumph
no
ringing
of
those
inward
marriage
bells
the
sound
of
whose
music
ought
to
be
so
pleasant
to
both
the
families
concerned
there
were
however
two
persons
quite
firm
to
their
purpose
and
these
were
the
bride
and
bridegroom
with
him
firmness
was
comparatively
easy
when
his
father
suggested
that
the
whole
bolton
family
was
making
itself
disagreeable
he
could
with
much
satisfaction
reply
that
he
did
not
intend
to
marry
the
whole
bolton
family
having
answered
the
first
letter
or
two
he
could
ignore
the
babington
remonstrances
and
when
he
was
as
to
points
of
doctrine
he
could
with
sincerity
profess
himself
to
be
of
the
same
creed
with
his
examiners
if
he
went
to
church
less
often
than
old
bolton
so
did
old
bolton
go
less
often
than
his
wife
it
was
a
matter
as
to
which
there
was
no
rule
thus
his
troubles
were
comparatively
light
and
his
firmness
might
be
regarded
as
a
thing
of
course
but
she
was
firm
too
and
firm
amidst
very
different
circumstances
though
her
mother
prayed
and
sobbed
implored
her
and
almost
cursed
her
still
she
was
firm
she
had
given
her
word
to
the
man
and
her
heart
and
she
would
not
go
back
papa
it
is
too
late
now
she
said
when
her
father
coming
from
his
wife
once
suggested
to
her
that
even
yet
it
was
not
too
late
course
i
shall
marry
him
she
said
to
robert
almost
with
indignation
when
robert
on
one
occasion
almost
broke
down
in
her
purpose
aunt
indeed
indeed
you
need
not
interfere
she
said
to
nicholas
he
were
all
that
they
have
called
him
still
i
would
marry
him
she
said
to
her
other
aunt
i
love
him
and
so
they
all
became
astonished
at
the
young
girl
whom
they
had
reared
up
among
them
and
to
understand
that
whatever
might
now
be
their
opinions
she
would
have
her
way
and
so
it
was
decided
that
they
should
be
married
on
a
certain
tuesday
in
the
middle
of
december
early
in
the
morning
she
was
to
be
brought
down
to
her
aunt
house
there
to
be
decked
in
her
bridal
robes
thence
to
be
taken
to
the
church
then
to
return
for
the
bridal
feast
and
from
thence
to
be
taken
off
by
her
husband
to
go
whither
they
might
list
chapter
xxi
the
wedding
it
was
a
sad
wedding
though
everything
within
the
power
of
robert
bolton
was
done
to
make
it
gay
there
was
a
great
breakfast
and
all
the
boltons
were
at
last
persuaded
to
be
present
except
bolton
and
nicholas
as
to
nicholas
she
was
hardly
even
asked
course
we
would
be
delighted
to
see
nicholas
if
she
would
come
robert
said
to
nicholas
himself
but
there
had
been
such
and
absolute
hostility
between
the
ladies
that
this
was
known
to
be
impossible
in
regard
to
bolton
herself
great
efforts
were
made
her
husband
condescended
to
beg
her
to
consent
on
this
one
occasion
to
appear
among
the
philistines
but
as
the
time
came
nearer
she
became
more
and
more
firm
in
her
resolution
shall
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
she
said
can
not
serve
god
and
mammon
when
the
old
man
tried
to
show
her
that
there
was
no
question
of
mammon
here
she
evaded
him
as
she
always
did
on
such
occasions
either
by
a
real
or
simulated
deficiency
of
consequent
intelligence
she
regarded
john
caldigate
as
being
altogether
unregenerate
and
therefore
a
man
of
the
world
and
therefore
a
disciple
of
mammon
she
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
her
to
do
what
she
thought
to
be
sinful
is
very
sinful
hating
people
as
you
hate
my
sons
families
he
said
in
his
wrath
nicholas
i
do
not
hate
their
families
i
certainly
do
not
hate
margaret
nor
yet
fanny
but
i
think
that
they
live
in
opposition
to
the
gospel
am
i
to
belie
my
own
belief
now
the
old
man
was
quite
certain
that
his
wife
did
hate
both
robert
wife
and
william
and
would
not
admit
in
her
own
mind
this
distinction
between
the
conduct
of
persons
and
the
persons
themselves
but
he
altogether
failed
in
his
attempts
to
induce
her
to
go
to
the
breakfast
the
great
contest
was
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
but
in
all
that
passed
between
them
no
reference
was
even
made
to
the
banquet
as
to
that
hester
was
indifferent
she
thought
on
the
whole
that
her
mother
would
do
best
to
be
absent
after
all
what
is
a
breakfast
or
what
the
significance
of
any
even
for
a
wedding
there
would
no
doubt
be
much
said
and
much
done
on
such
an
occasion
at
variance
with
her
mother
feelings
even
the
enforced
gaiety
of
the
dresses
would
be
distasteful
to
her
and
there
would
hardly
be
sufficient
cause
for
pressing
her
to
be
present
on
such
an
occasion
but
in
reference
to
the
church
the
question
to
hester
thinking
was
very
different
she
said
you
are
not
there
it
will
be
a
lasting
misery
to
me
can
i
go
there
when
i
would
give
so
much
to
save
you
from
going
there
yourself
this
was
a
terrible
thing
for
a
mother
to
say
to
her
own
child
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
but
it
had
been
now
said
so
often
as
to
have
lost
something
of
its
sting
it
had
come
to
be
understood
that
bolton
would
not
allow
herself
to
give
any
assent
to
the
marriage
but
that
the
marriage
was
to
go
on
without
such
assent
all
that
had
been
settled
but
still
she
might
go
to
the
church
with
them
and
pray
for
good
results
she
feared
that
evil
would
come
but
still
she
might
wish
for
good
wish
for
it
and
pray
for
it
do
want
me
to
be
unhappy
mamma
said
the
mother
can
want
her
child
to
be
unhappy
but
there
is
an
unhappiness
harder
to
be
borne
more
to
be
dreaded
enduring
so
much
longer
than
that
which
we
may
suffer
here
you
not
come
and
pray
that
i
may
be
delivered
also
from
that
as
i
am
going
from
you
will
you
not
let
me
know
that
you
are
there
with
me
at
the
last
moment
though
you
do
not
love
him
you
do
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
oh
mamma
let
me
feel
at
any
rate
that
you
are
there
then
the
mother
promised
that
she
would
be
there
in
the
church
though
unknown
to
or
at
least
unrecognised
by
any
one
else
when
the
morning
came
and
when
hester
was
dropped
at
the
nurseries
in
order
that
she
might
go
up
and
be
invested
in
her
finery
amidst
her
bridesmaids
who
were
all
her
cousins
the
carriage
went
on
and
took
bolton
to
the
church
it
was
represented
to
her
that
by
this
arrangement
she
would
be
forced
to
remain
an
hour
alone
in
the
cold
building
but
she
was
one
of
those
who
regarded
all
discomfort
as
meritorious
as
in
some
way
adding
something
to
her
claim
for
heaven
with
rods
as
a
penance
was
to
her
thinking
a
papistical
ordinance
most
abominable
and
damnatory
but
the
essence
of
the
was
as
comfortable
to
her
as
ever
was
a
to
a
roman
catholic
enthusiast
so
she
went
and
sat
apart
in
a
dark
distant
pew
dressed
in
black
and
deeply
veiled
praying
not
it
is
to
be
feared
that
john
caldigate
might
be
a
good
husband
to
her
girl
but
that
he
as
he
made
his
way
downward
to
things
below
might
not
drag
her
darling
with
him
that
only
a
few
can
be
saved
was
the
fact
in
all
her
religion
with
which
she
was
most
thoroughly
conversant
the
strait
way
and
the
narrow
gate
through
which
only
a
few
can
pass
were
they
not
known
to
all
believers
to
all
who
had
a
glimmering
of
belief
as
an
established
part
of
the
christian
faith
as
a
part
so
established
that
to
dream
even
that
the
gate
would
be
made
broad
and
the
way
open
would
be
to
dream
against
the
gospel
against
the
very
plainest
of
god
words
if
so
and
she
would
tell
herself
at
all
hours
that
certainly
certainly
certainly
so
it
was
then
why
should
she
trouble
herself
for
one
so
little
likely
to
come
in
the
way
of
salvation
as
this
man
who
was
now
robbing
her
of
her
daughter
if
it
was
the
will
of
the
almighty
as
it
clearly
was
the
will
of
the
almighty
that
out
of
every
hundred
ninety
and
nine
should
perish
could
she
dare
now
to
pray
more
than
for
one
or
if
her
prayers
were
wider
must
they
not
be
inefficacious
yes
there
had
been
the
thief
upon
the
cross
it
was
all
possible
but
this
man
was
a
thief
not
upon
the
cross
and
therefore
as
she
prayed
that
morning
she
said
not
a
prayer
for
him
in
the
meantime
the
carriage
had
gone
back
for
the
bride
who
in
very
simple
raiment
but
yet
in
array
was
taken
up
to
the
church
these
boltons
were
prosperous
people
who
had
all
their
carriages
so
that
there
was
no
lack
of
vehicles
two
of
the
girls
from
london
and
two
from
the
nurseries
made
up
the
bevy
of
bridesmaids
who
were
as
bright
and
fair
as
though
the
bride
had
come
from
some
worldlier
stock
robert
indeed
had
done
all
she
could
to
give
to
the
whole
concern
a
becoming
bridal
brightness
till
even
daniel
had
been
tempted
to
remonstrate
do
see
why
you
should
wear
pretty
things
if
you
got
the
money
to
pay
for
them
said
robert
daniel
shook
her
head
but
on
the
afternoon
before
the
wedding
she
bought
an
additional
ribbon
caldigate
came
over
from
folking
that
morning
attended
by
one
john
jones
an
old
college
friend
as
his
best
man
the
squire
was
not
at
the
wedding
but
on
the
day
before
he
was
with
hester
at
the
nurseries
telling
her
that
she
should
be
his
dear
daughter
and
at
the
same
time
giving
her
a
whole
set
of
wicked
but
very
pretty
worldly
gauds
my
word
my
dear
he
has
been
very
gracious
said
robert
when
she
saw
them
quite
envy
the
girls
being
married
nowadays
because
they
get
such
pretty
things
are
very
pretty
said
hester
must
have
cost
i
afraid
to
say
how
much
money
suppose
it
means
to
say
that
he
will
love
me
and
therefore
i
am
so
glad
to
have
them
but
the
squire
though
he
did
mean
to
say
that
he
would
love
her
did
not
come
to
the
wedding
he
was
he
said
unaccustomed
to
such
things
and
hoped
that
he
might
be
excused
therefore
from
the
folking
side
there
was
no
one
but
john
caldigate
himself
and
john
jones
of
the
babingtons
of
course
there
was
not
one
as
long
as
there
was
a
possibility
of
success
babington
had
kept
up
her
remonstrances
but
when
there
was
no
longer
a
possibility
she
announced
that
there
was
to
be
an
everlasting
quarrel
between
the
houses
babington
and
folking
were
for
the
future
to
know
nothing
of
each
other
caldigate
had
hoped
that
though
the
ladies
would
for
a
time
be
unforgiving
his
uncle
and
his
male
cousins
would
not
take
up
the
quarrel
but
aunt
polly
was
too
strong
for
that
and
he
was
declared
to
be
a
viper
who
had
been
warmed
in
all
their
bosoms
and
had
then
stung
them
all
round
you
will
nurse
a
viper
in
your
bosom
of
course
he
will
sting
you
said
aunt
polly
in
a
letter
which
she
took
the
trouble
to
write
to
the
squire
in
reply
to
which
the
squire
wrote
back
thus
dear
sister
if
you
will
look
into
your
dictionary
of
natural
history
you
will
see
that
vipers
have
no
stings
yours
truly
d
caldigate
this
letter
was
supposed
to
add
much
to
the
already
existing
offence
but
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
in
spite
of
all
this
quarrelling
and
the
mother
standing
up
in
the
dark
corner
of
her
pew
heard
her
daughter
voice
as
she
vowed
to
devote
herself
to
her
husband
as
she
heard
it
she
also
devoted
herself
when
sorrow
should
come
as
sorrow
certainly
would
come
then
she
would
be
ready
once
again
to
be
a
mother
to
her
child
but
till
that
time
should
come
the
wife
of
john
caldigate
would
be
nothing
to
her
she
was
not
content
with
thinking
and
resolving
that
it
should
be
so
but
she
declared
her
intention
in
so
many
words
to
her
daughter
for
poor
hester
though
she
was
proud
of
her
husband
this
was
in
truth
a
miserable
day
could
she
have
been
induced
to
separate
herself
altogether
from
her
mother
on
the
previous
night
or
even
on
that
morning
it
would
have
been
better
but
there
was
with
her
that
customary
longing
for
a
last
word
of
farewell
which
has
often
made
so
many
of
us
wretched
and
then
there
was
a
feeling
that
as
she
was
giving
herself
away
in
marriage
altogether
in
opposition
to
her
counsels
on
that
very
account
she
owed
to
her
more
attached
and
increased
observance
therefore
she
had
arranged
with
her
husband
that
when
she
returned
from
the
banquet
to
prepare
herself
for
her
journey
a
longer
absence
than
usual
should
be
allowed
to
her
so
that
she
might
be
taken
back
to
chesterton
and
might
thus
see
her
mother
the
last
after
saying
farewell
to
all
the
others
then
the
carriage
should
return
to
the
nurseries
and
he
would
be
ready
to
step
in
and
she
need
not
show
herself
again
worn
out
as
she
would
be
with
the
tears
and
sobbings
which
she
anticipated
it
all
went
as
it
was
arranged
but
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
arrange
it
otherwise
the
journey
to
the
grange
and
back
together
with
the
time
spent
in
the
interview
took
an
hour
and
the
time
went
very
slowly
with
the
marriage
guests
there
always
comes
a
period
beyond
which
it
is
impossible
to
be
festive
when
the
bride
left
the
room
the
bridesmaids
and
other
ladies
went
with
her
then
the
gentlemen
who
remained
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
each
other
old
bolton
was
not
jovial
on
the
occasion
and
the
four
brothers
hardly
knew
how
to
find
subjects
for
conversation
on
such
an
occasion
the
bridegroom
felt
the
hour
to
be
very
long
although
he
consented
to
play
billiards
with
the
boys
and
john
jones
although
he
did
at
last
escape
and
find
his
way
up
among
the
girls
thought
that
his
friend
had
married
himself
into
a
very
sombre
family
but
all
this
was
pleasant
pastime
indeed
compared
with
that
which
poor
hester
endured
in
her
mother
bedroom
it
has
been
done
said
bolton
sitting
in
a
comfortless
little
chair
which
she
was
accustomed
to
use
when
secluded
with
her
bible
from
all
the
household
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
might
have
been
fit
had
a
son
of
hers
been
just
executed
on
the
gallows
mamma
do
not
speak
of
it
like
that
darling
my
own
one
would
you
have
me
pretend
what
i
do
not
feel
yes
even
that
would
be
better
than
treatment
such
as
this
that
would
have
been
hester
reply
could
she
have
spoken
her
mind
but
she
could
not
speak
it
and
therefore
she
stood
silent
will
not
pretend
you
and
your
father
have
done
this
thing
against
my
wishes
and
against
my
advice
is
i
that
have
done
it
mamma
would
not
have
persevered
had
he
been
firm
as
firm
as
i
have
been
but
he
has
vacillated
turning
hither
and
thither
serving
god
and
mammon
and
he
has
allowed
himself
to
be
ruled
by
his
own
son
i
will
never
never
speak
to
robert
bolton
again
mamma
do
not
say
that
do
say
it
i
swear
it
you
shall
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
if
there
be
pitch
on
earth
he
is
pitch
if
your
eye
offend
you
pluck
it
out
he
is
my
i
know
but
i
will
pluck
him
out
like
an
eye
that
has
offended
it
is
he
that
has
robbed
me
of
my
child
i
not
still
your
child
said
hester
going
down
on
her
knees
with
her
hands
in
her
mother
lap
and
her
eyes
turned
up
to
her
face
you
are
not
mine
any
longer
you
are
his
you
are
that
man
wife
when
he
bids
you
do
that
which
is
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
you
must
do
it
and
he
will
bid
you
you
are
not
my
child
now
as
days
run
on
and
sins
grow
black
i
can
not
warn
you
now
against
the
wrath
to
come
but
though
you
are
not
my
child
though
you
are
this
man
wife
i
will
pray
for
you
for
him
do
not
know
i
can
not
say
who
am
i
that
i
should
venture
to
pray
specially
for
a
stranger
that
his
way
may
be
shown
to
all
sinners
thus
will
i
pray
for
him
and
it
will
be
shown
though
whether
he
will
walk
in
it
who
can
say
that
so
much
was
true
of
john
caldigate
no
doubt
and
is
true
of
all
but
there
was
a
tone
in
her
voice
which
implied
that
in
regard
to
this
special
sinner
there
could
be
very
little
hope
indeed
should
you
think
that
he
is
bad
mamma
are
all
bad
there
is
no
doubt
about
his
being
bad
there
is
not
one
among
us
fit
to
sweep
the
lowest
step
of
god
throne
but
they
who
are
his
people
shall
be
made
bright
enough
to
sit
round
his
feet
may
the
time
come
when
you
my
darling
shall
be
restored
to
the
fold
the
poor
young
wife
by
this
time
had
acknowledged
to
herself
the
mistake
she
had
made
in
thus
coming
to
her
mother
after
her
marriage
she
now
was
of
course
in
that
ecstatic
phase
of
existence
which
makes
one
own
self
altogether
subordinate
to
the
self
of
another
person
that
her
husband
should
be
happy
constituted
her
hope
of
happiness
that
he
should
be
comfortable
her
comfort
if
he
were
thought
worthy
that
would
be
her
worthiness
or
if
he
were
good
that
would
be
her
goodness
and
even
as
to
those
higher
more
distant
aspirations
amidst
which
her
mother
was
always
dwelling
she
would
take
no
joy
for
herself
which
did
not
include
him
the
denunciations
against
him
which
were
so
plainly
included
even
in
her
mother
blessings
and
prayers
for
herself
did
not
frighten
her
on
behalf
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
devoted
herself
she
could
see
the
fanaticism
and
fury
of
her
mother
creed
but
she
could
not
escape
from
the
curse
of
the
moment
when
that
last
imprecation
was
made
by
the
woman
with
her
hands
folded
and
her
eyes
turned
up
to
heaven
hester
could
only
bury
her
face
on
her
mother
knees
and
weep
that
time
comes
and
i
know
it
will
come
you
shall
return
to
me
and
once
more
be
my
child
said
the
mother
do
not
mean
that
i
shall
leave
my
husband
can
tell
if
you
do
and
i
am
living
you
shall
be
my
child
till
then
we
must
be
apart
how
can
it
be
otherwise
can
i
give
my
cheek
to
a
man
to
be
kissed
and
call
him
my
son
when
i
think
that
he
has
robbed
me
of
my
only
treasure
this
was
so
terrible
that
the
daughter
could
only
hang
around
her
mother
neck
sobbing
and
kissing
her
at
the
same
time
and
then
go
without
another
word
she
was
sure
of
this
that
if
she
must
lose
one
or
the
other
her
mother
or
her
husband
then
she
would
lose
her
mother
when
she
returned
to
the
nurseries
her
husband
according
to
agreement
came
out
to
her
at
once
she
had
bidden
adieu
to
all
the
others
but
at
the
last
moment
her
father
put
his
hand
into
the
carriage
so
that
she
could
take
it
and
kiss
it
is
so
sad
she
said
to
him
home
to
her
and
comfort
her
of
course
the
old
man
did
go
home
but
he
was
aware
that
there
would
for
some
time
be
little
comfort
there
either
for
him
or
for
his
wife
he
and
his
sons
had
been
too
powerful
for
her
in
arranging
the
marriage
but
now
now
that
it
was
done
nothing
could
stop
her
reproaches
he
had
been
made
to
think
it
wrong
on
one
side
to
shut
his
girl
up
and
now
from
the
other
side
he
was
being
made
to
think
that
he
had
done
very
wrong
in
allowing
her
to
escape
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
be
driven
out
of
cambridge
to
the
railway
station
at
audley
end
on
their
way
to
london
so
that
they
might
avoid
the
crowd
of
people
who
would
know
them
at
the
cambridge
station
as
soon
as
they
had
got
away
from
the
door
of
robert
bolton
house
the
husband
attempted
to
comfort
his
young
wife
any
rate
it
is
over
he
said
alluding
of
course
to
the
tedium
of
their
wedding
festivities
much
is
over
she
replied
do
not
regret
anything
she
shook
her
head
slowly
as
she
leaned
lovingly
against
his
shoulder
are
not
sorry
hester
that
you
have
become
my
wife
had
to
be
your
wife
because
i
love
you
that
a
sorrow
had
been
all
my
mother
and
now
i
am
all
yours
she
has
thrown
me
off
because
i
have
disobeyed
her
i
hope
you
will
never
throw
me
off
it
likely
think
not
i
know
that
i
shall
never
throw
you
off
they
have
tried
to
make
me
believe
that
you
are
not
all
that
you
ought
to
be
in
religion
but
now
your
religion
shall
be
my
religion
and
your
life
my
life
i
shall
be
of
your
colour
altogether
but
john
a
limb
can
not
be
wrenched
out
of
a
socket
as
i
have
been
torn
away
from
my
mother
without
pain
will
forgive
it
all
when
we
come
back
fear
i
fear
i
never
knew
her
to
forgive
anything
yet
this
was
very
bad
but
nevertheless
it
was
plain
to
him
as
it
had
been
plain
to
robert
and
william
bolton
that
not
because
of
the
violence
of
the
woman
character
should
the
life
of
her
daughter
have
been
sacrificed
to
her
his
duty
to
make
her
new
life
bright
for
her
was
all
the
more
plain
and
all
the
more
sound
and
as
they
made
their
first
journey
together
he
explained
to
her
how
sacred
that
duty
should
always
be
to
him
chapter
xxii
as
to
touching
pitch
before
the
wedding
old
caldigate
arranged
with
his
son
that
he
would
give
up
to
the
young
married
people
the
house
at
folking
and
indeed
the
entire
management
of
the
property
have
made
up
my
mind
about
it
said
the
squire
who
at
this
time
was
living
with
his
son
on
happy
terms
have
never
been
adapted
for
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
he
continued
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
have
in
a
certain
way
come
to
love
the
old
place
but
i
do
care
about
wheat
nor
yet
about
bullocks
and
a
country
house
should
always
have
a
mistress
and
so
it
was
settled
caldigate
took
for
himself
a
house
in
cambridge
whither
he
proposed
to
remove
nothing
but
himself
and
his
books
and
promised
to
have
folking
ready
for
his
son
and
his
bride
on
their
return
from
their
wedding
tour
in
all
this
robert
bolton
and
the
old
squire
acted
together
the
brother
thinking
that
the
position
would
suit
his
sister
well
but
others
among
the
boltons
mrs
daniel
the
london
people
and
even
robert
herself
had
thought
that
the
people
had
better
be
further
away
from
the
influences
or
annoyances
of
puritan
grange
robert
however
had
declared
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
yield
to
the
temper
and
prejudice
and
fury
as
he
called
it
of
his
father
wife
when
this
discussion
was
going
on
she
had
absolutely
quarrelled
with
the
attorney
and
the
attorney
had
made
up
his
mind
that
she
should
be
ignored
and
then
too
as
robert
explained
it
must
be
for
the
husband
and
not
for
the
wife
to
choose
where
they
would
live
folking
was
or
at
any
rate
would
be
his
own
by
right
of
inheritance
and
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
that
a
man
should
be
driven
away
from
his
natural
duties
and
from
the
enjoyment
of
his
natural
privileges
by
the
mad
humours
of
a
fanatic
female
in
all
this
old
bolton
was
hardly
consulted
but
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
express
an
opinion
he
was
giving
his
daughter
absolutely
no
fortune
nor
had
he
even
vouchsafed
to
declare
what
money
should
be
coming
to
her
at
his
death
john
caldigate
had
positively
refused
to
say
a
word
on
the
subject
had
refused
even
when
instigated
to
do
so
by
hester
brother
shall
be
just
as
he
pleases
caldigate
had
said
told
your
father
that
i
was
not
looking
after
his
daughter
with
any
view
to
money
and
i
will
be
as
good
as
my
word
robert
had
told
her
father
that
something
should
be
arranged
but
the
old
man
had
put
it
off
from
day
to
day
and
nothing
had
been
arranged
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
excluded
almost
from
having
an
opinion
as
to
his
daughter
future
life
it
was
understood
that
the
marriage
trip
should
be
continued
for
some
months
caldigate
was
fettered
by
no
business
that
required
an
early
return
he
had
worked
hard
for
five
years
and
felt
that
he
had
earned
a
holiday
and
hester
naturally
was
well
disposed
to
be
absent
for
as
long
a
time
as
would
suit
her
husband
time
and
time
alone
might
perhaps
soften
her
mother
heart
they
went
to
italy
and
stayed
during
the
winter
months
in
rome
and
then
when
the
fine
weather
came
they
returned
across
the
alps
and
lingered
about
among
the
playgrounds
of
europe
visiting
switzerland
the
tyrol
and
the
pyrenees
and
returning
home
to
cambridgeshire
at
the
close
of
the
following
september
and
then
there
was
a
reason
for
the
return
it
would
be
well
that
the
coming
heir
to
the
folking
estate
should
be
born
at
folking
whether
an
heir
or
only
an
insignificant
girl
it
would
be
well
that
the
child
should
be
born
amidst
the
comforts
of
home
and
so
they
came
back
when
they
reached
the
station
at
cambridge
the
squire
was
there
to
receive
them
as
were
also
robert
bolton
and
his
wife
am
already
in
my
new
house
said
the
old
man
i
mean
to
go
out
with
you
for
and
and
just
stay
till
you
are
comfortably
fixed
never
see
her
myself
said
robert
in
answer
to
a
whispered
inquiry
from
his
sister
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
she
will
never
see
me
but
i
hear
from
the
others
that
she
speaks
of
you
constantly
has
written
to
me
of
course
but
she
never
mentions
john
in
writing
back
i
have
always
sent
his
love
and
have
endeavoured
to
show
that
i
would
not
recognise
any
quarrel
i
were
you
said
robert
would
not
take
him
with
me
when
i
went
then
the
three
caldigates
were
taken
off
to
folking
a
week
passed
by
and
then
arrived
the
day
on
which
it
had
been
arranged
that
hester
was
to
go
to
chesterton
and
see
her
mother
there
had
been
numerous
letters
and
at
last
the
matter
was
settled
between
caldigate
and
old
bolton
at
the
bank
think
you
had
better
let
her
come
alone
the
old
man
had
said
when
caldigate
asked
whether
he
might
be
allowed
to
accompany
his
wife
bolton
has
not
been
well
since
her
daughter
marriage
and
has
felt
the
desolation
of
her
position
very
much
she
is
weak
and
nervous
and
i
think
you
had
better
let
hester
come
alone
had
caldigate
known
his
better
he
would
not
have
suggested
a
visit
from
himself
no
one
who
did
know
her
would
have
looked
forward
to
see
her
old
hatred
eradicated
by
an
absence
of
nine
months
hester
therefore
went
into
cambridge
alone
and
was
taken
up
to
the
house
by
her
father
as
she
entered
the
iron
gates
she
felt
almost
as
though
she
were
going
into
the
presence
of
one
who
was
an
enemy
to
herself
and
yet
when
she
saw
her
mother
she
rushed
at
once
into
the
poor
woman
arms
mamma
dear
mamma
dearest
mamma
my
own
own
own
mamma
bolton
was
sitting
by
the
open
window
of
a
small
breakfast
parlour
which
looked
into
the
garden
and
had
before
her
on
her
little
table
her
knitting
and
a
volume
of
sermons
you
have
come
back
hester
she
said
after
a
short
pause
she
had
risen
at
first
to
receive
her
daughter
and
had
returned
her
child
caresses
but
had
then
reseated
herself
quickly
as
though
anxious
not
to
evince
any
strong
feeling
on
the
occasion
mamma
i
have
come
back
we
have
been
so
happy
am
glad
you
have
been
happy
such
joys
are
but
still
has
been
so
good
to
me
mamma
good
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
word
good
she
doubted
the
goodness
of
such
goodness
as
his
do
not
they
who
are
tempted
by
the
pleasures
of
the
world
always
praise
the
and
kindness
of
them
by
whom
they
are
tempted
there
are
meanings
to
the
word
good
which
are
so
opposed
one
to
another
husband
is
i
suppose
generally
kind
to
his
wife
at
any
rate
for
a
little
time
she
said
mamma
i
do
so
wish
you
knew
him
the
woman
turned
her
face
round
away
from
her
daughter
and
assumed
that
look
of
hard
determined
impregnable
obstinacy
with
which
hester
had
been
well
acquainted
all
her
life
but
the
young
wife
had
come
there
with
a
purpose
not
strong
perhaps
in
actual
hope
but
resolute
even
against
hope
to
do
her
best
there
must
be
an
enduring
misery
to
her
unless
she
could
bring
her
mother
into
some
friendly
relation
with
her
husband
and
she
had
calculated
that
the
softness
produced
by
her
return
would
give
a
better
chance
for
this
than
she
might
find
at
any
more
protracted
time
but
bolton
had
also
made
her
calculations
and
had
come
to
her
determination
she
turned
her
head
away
therefore
and
sat
quite
silent
with
the
old
stubborn
look
of
resolved
purpose
you
will
let
him
come
to
you
now
your
own
hester
husband
we
to
be
divided
for
ever
i
not
tell
you
before
when
you
were
going
shall
i
lie
and
say
that
i
love
him
i
will
not
touch
pitch
lest
i
be
defiled
he
is
my
husband
you
shall
not
call
him
pitch
he
is
my
very
own
mamma
mamma
recall
the
word
that
you
have
said
the
woman
felt
that
it
had
to
be
recalled
in
some
degree
said
nothing
of
him
hester
i
call
that
pitch
which
i
believe
to
be
wrong
and
if
i
swerve
but
a
wittingly
towards
what
i
believe
to
be
evil
then
i
shall
be
touching
pitch
and
then
i
shall
be
defiled
i
did
not
say
that
he
was
pitch
judge
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
judged
but
if
ever
judgment
was
pronounced
and
a
verdict
given
and
penalties
awarded
such
was
done
now
in
regard
to
john
caldigate
mamma
why
will
it
be
doing
evil
to
be
gracious
to
your
husband
the
woman
had
an
answer
to
this
appeal
very
clearly
set
forth
in
her
mind
though
she
was
unable
to
produce
it
clearly
in
words
when
the
marriage
had
been
first
discussed
she
had
opposed
it
with
all
her
power
because
she
had
believed
the
man
to
be
wicked
he
was
unregenerate
and
when
she
had
put
it
to
her
husband
and
to
the
nicholases
and
to
the
daniels
to
see
whether
such
was
not
the
case
they
had
not
contradicted
her
it
was
acknowledged
that
he
was
such
a
one
as
robert
a
worldly
man
all
round
and
then
he
was
worse
than
robert
having
been
a
spendthrift
a
gambler
and
if
the
rumours
which
had
reached
them
were
true
given
to
the
company
of
loose
women
she
had
striven
with
all
her
might
that
such
a
one
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
her
daughter
from
her
and
had
striven
in
vain
he
had
succeeded
but
his
character
was
not
changed
by
his
success
did
she
not
know
him
to
be
chaff
that
must
be
separated
by
the
wind
from
the
corn
and
then
consumed
in
the
fire
his
character
was
not
altered
because
that
human
being
whom
she
loved
the
best
in
all
the
world
had
fallen
into
his
power
he
was
not
the
less
chaff
the
less
likely
to
be
burned
that
her
daughter
should
become
chaff
also
ah
there
was
the
agony
of
it
if
instead
of
taking
the
husband
and
wife
together
she
could
even
now
separate
them
would
it
not
be
her
duty
to
do
so
of
all
duties
would
it
not
be
the
first
let
the
misery
here
be
what
it
might
what
was
that
to
eternal
misery
or
to
eternal
bliss
when
therefore
she
was
asked
whether
she
would
be
doing
evil
were
she
to
be
gracious
to
her
own
she
was
quite
quite
sure
that
any
such
civility
would
be
a
sin
the
man
was
pitch
though
she
had
been
coerced
by
the
exigencies
of
a
worldly
courtesy
to
deny
that
she
had
intended
to
say
so
he
was
pitch
to
her
and
she
declared
to
herself
that
were
she
to
touch
him
she
would
be
defiled
but
she
knew
not
in
what
language
to
explain
all
this
you
call
graciousness
hester
is
an
obligation
of
which
religion
knows
nothing
she
said
after
a
pause
do
know
why
it
should
are
we
to
be
divided
mamma
because
of
religion
you
were
alone
i
am
not
alone
oh
mamma
mamma
do
you
not
know
that
i
am
going
to
become
a
mother
child
you
will
not
be
with
me
because
you
think
that
you
and
john
differ
as
to
religious
forms
she
said
is
the
spirit
there
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
i
ask
you
yourself
whether
his
life
as
you
have
seen
it
is
such
as
i
should
think
conformable
with
the
word
of
god
life
is
so
an
effort
may
be
made
do
not
let
us
palter
with
each
other
hester
there
are
the
sheep
and
there
are
the
goats
of
which
is
he
according
to
the
teaching
of
your
early
years
in
which
flock
would
he
be
found
if
account
were
taken
now
there
was
something
so
terrible
in
this
that
the
young
wife
who
was
thus
called
upon
to
denounce
her
husband
separated
herself
by
some
steps
from
her
mother
retreating
back
to
a
chair
in
which
she
seated
herself
you
remember
mamma
the
words
you
said
just
now
judge
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
judged
do
i
judge
how
does
it
go
on
forgive
and
ye
shall
be
forgiven
do
i
judge
nor
can
i
forgive
this
she
said
putting
all
her
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
and
thereby
declaring
her
own
humility
the
great
truths
of
my
religion
are
dear
to
me
i
will
not
trust
myself
in
the
way
of
sinners
because
by
some
worldly
alliance
to
which
i
myself
was
no
consenting
party
i
have
been
brought
into
worldly
contact
with
them
i
at
any
rate
will
be
firm
i
say
to
you
now
no
more
than
i
said
ah
so
many
times
when
it
was
still
possible
that
my
words
should
not
be
vain
they
were
vain
but
not
on
that
account
am
i
to
be
changed
i
will
not
be
wound
like
a
skein
of
silk
round
your
little
finger
that
was
it
was
she
to
give
way
in
everything
because
they
had
been
successful
among
them
in
carrying
out
this
marriage
in
opposition
to
her
judgment
was
she
to
assent
that
this
man
be
treated
as
a
sheep
because
he
had
prevailed
against
her
while
she
was
so
well
aware
that
he
would
still
have
been
a
goat
to
them
all
had
he
not
prevailed
she
at
any
rate
was
sincere
she
was
consistent
she
would
be
true
to
her
principles
even
at
the
expense
of
all
her
natural
yearnings
of
what
use
to
her
would
be
her
religious
convictions
if
she
were
to
give
them
up
just
because
her
were
torn
and
agonised
the
man
was
a
goat
though
he
were
ten
times
told
her
child
husband
so
she
looked
again
away
into
the
garden
and
resolved
that
she
would
not
yield
in
a
single
point
mamma
said
hester
rising
from
her
chair
and
coming
up
to
her
mother
hester
god
bless
you
my
child
will
not
come
to
me
to
folking
i
will
not
go
to
folking
may
come
to
you
here
yes
as
often
as
you
will
and
for
as
long
as
you
will
can
not
stay
away
from
home
without
him
you
know
said
the
young
wife
often
as
you
will
and
for
as
long
as
you
will
the
mother
said
again
repeating
the
words
with
emphasis
i
could
have
you
here
as
i
used
to
do
so
as
to
look
after
every
want
and
administer
to
every
wish
my
fingers
shall
work
for
your
baby
and
my
prayers
shall
be
said
for
him
and
for
you
morning
and
night
i
am
not
changed
hester
i
am
still
and
ever
shall
be
while
i
am
spared
your
own
loving
mother
so
they
parted
and
hester
was
driven
back
to
folking
in
forming
our
opinion
as
to
others
we
are
daily
brought
into
difficulty
by
doubting
how
much
we
should
allow
to
their
convictions
and
how
far
we
are
justified
in
condemning
those
who
do
not
accede
to
our
own
bolton
believed
every
word
that
she
said
there
was
no
touch
of
hypocrisy
about
her
could
she
without
sting
of
conscience
have
gone
off
to
folking
and
ate
of
her
bread
and
drank
of
his
cup
and
sat
in
his
presence
no
mother
living
would
have
enjoyed
more
thoroughly
the
delight
of
waiting
upon
and
caressing
and
bending
over
her
child
she
denied
herself
all
this
with
an
agony
of
spirit
groaning
not
only
over
their
earthly
separation
thinking
not
only
of
her
daughter
present
dangers
but
tormented
also
by
reflections
as
to
dangers
and
possible
separations
in
another
world
but
she
knew
she
was
right
she
knew
at
least
that
were
she
to
act
otherwise
there
would
be
upon
her
conscience
the
weight
of
sin
she
did
not
know
that
the
convictions
on
which
she
rested
with
such
confidence
had
come
in
truth
from
her
injured
pride
had
settled
themselves
in
her
mind
because
she
had
been
beaten
in
her
endeavours
to
prevent
her
marriage
she
was
not
aware
that
she
regarded
john
caldigate
as
a
goat
as
one
who
beyond
all
doubt
was
a
goat
simply
because
john
caldigate
had
had
his
way
while
she
had
been
debarred
from
hers
such
no
doubt
was
the
case
and
yet
who
can
deny
her
praise
for
fidelity
to
her
own
convictions
when
we
read
of
those
who
have
massacred
and
tortured
their
opponents
in
religion
have
boiled
alive
the
unfortunates
who
have
differed
from
themselves
as
to
the
meaning
of
an
unintelligible
word
or
two
have
vigorously
torn
the
entrails
out
of
those
who
have
been
pious
with
a
piety
different
from
their
own
how
shall
we
dare
to
say
that
they
should
be
punished
for
their
fidelity
bolton
spent
much
of
that
afternoon
with
her
knees
on
the
hard
boards
thinking
that
a
hassock
would
have
taken
something
from
the
sanctity
of
the
action
wrestling
for
her
child
in
prayer
and
she
told
herself
that
her
prayer
had
been
heard
she
got
up
more
than
ever
assured
that
she
must
not
touch
pitch
lest
she
should
be
defiled
let
us
pray
for
what
we
will
with
earnestness
though
it
be
for
the
destruction
of
half
of
a
world
we
are
sure
to
think
that
our
prayers
have
been
heard
chapter
xxiii
the
new
heir
things
went
on
smoothly
at
folking
or
with
apparent
smoothness
for
three
months
during
which
john
caldigate
surprised
both
his
friends
and
his
enemies
by
the
exemplary
manner
in
which
he
fulfilled
his
duties
as
a
parish
squire
he
was
put
on
the
commission
and
was
in
the
way
to
become
the
most
active
justice
of
the
peace
in
those
parts
he
made
himself
intimate
with
all
the
tenants
and
was
almost
worshipped
by
ralph
holt
his
nearest
neighbour
to
whose
judgment
he
submitted
himself
in
all
agricultural
matters
he
shot
a
little
but
moderately
having
no
inclination
to
foster
what
is
called
a
head
of
game
and
he
went
to
church
very
regularly
having
renewed
his
intimacy
with
bromley
the
parson
a
gentleman
who
had
unfortunately
found
it
necessary
to
quarrel
with
the
old
squire
because
the
old
squire
had
been
so
manifestly
a
pagan
there
had
been
unhappiness
in
the
parish
on
this
head
and
especially
unhappiness
to
bromley
who
was
a
good
man
that
caldigate
should
be
what
he
called
a
pagan
had
been
represented
by
bromley
to
his
friends
as
a
great
misfortune
and
especially
a
misfortune
to
the
squire
himself
but
he
would
have
ignored
that
in
regard
to
social
life
so
bromley
said
when
discussing
the
matter
if
the
pagan
would
have
desisted
from
arguing
the
subject
but
when
caldigate
insisted
on
the
parson
owning
the
unreasonableness
of
his
own
belief
and
called
upon
him
to
confess
himself
to
be
either
a
fool
or
a
hypocrite
then
the
parson
found
himself
constrained
to
drop
all
further
intercourse
is
the
way
with
all
priests
said
the
old
squire
triumphantly
to
the
first
man
he
could
get
to
hear
him
moment
you
disagree
with
them
they
become
your
enemies
at
once
and
would
straightway
kill
you
if
they
had
the
power
he
probably
did
not
know
how
very
disagreeable
he
had
made
himself
to
the
poor
clergyman
but
now
matters
were
on
a
much
better
footing
and
all
the
parish
rejoiced
the
new
squire
was
seen
in
his
pew
every
sunday
morning
and
often
entertained
the
parson
at
the
house
the
rumour
of
this
change
was
indeed
so
great
that
more
than
the
truth
reached
the
ears
of
some
of
the
boltons
and
advantage
was
taken
of
it
by
those
who
desired
to
prove
to
bolton
that
the
man
was
not
a
goat
what
more
would
she
have
he
went
regularly
to
morning
and
evening
service
here
it
was
that
rumour
exaggerated
our
hero
virtues
did
all
his
duty
as
a
country
gentleman
and
was
kind
to
his
wife
the
daniels
who
were
but
lukewarm
people
thought
that
bolton
was
bound
to
give
way
robert
declared
among
her
friends
that
the
poor
woman
was
becoming
mad
from
religion
and
the
old
banker
himself
was
driven
very
hard
for
a
reply
when
robert
asked
him
whether
such
a
as
john
caldigate
ought
to
be
kept
at
arms
length
the
old
man
did
in
truth
hate
the
name
of
john
caldigate
and
regretted
bitterly
the
indiscretion
of
that
day
when
the
spendthrift
had
been
admitted
within
his
gates
though
he
had
agreed
to
the
marriage
partly
from
a
sense
of
duty
to
his
child
partly
under
the
influences
of
his
son
he
had
since
that
been
subject
to
his
wife
for
nine
or
ten
months
she
had
not
been
able
to
prevail
against
him
in
action
but
no
earthly
power
could
stop
her
tongue
now
when
these
new
praises
were
dinned
into
his
ears
when
he
did
convince
himself
that
as
far
as
worldly
matters
went
his
was
likely
to
become
a
prosperous
and
respected
gentleman
he
would
fain
have
let
the
question
of
hostility
drop
there
need
not
have
been
much
intercourse
between
puritan
grange
and
folking
but
then
also
there
need
be
no
quarrel
he
was
desirous
that
caldigate
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
the
house
and
that
even
visits
of
ceremony
should
be
made
to
folking
but
bolton
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
half
friendship
in
the
time
that
was
coming
she
must
be
everything
or
nothing
to
her
daughter
and
she
could
not
be
brought
to
think
that
one
who
had
been
so
manifestly
a
goat
should
cease
to
be
a
goat
so
suddenly
in
other
words
she
could
not
soften
her
heart
towards
the
man
who
had
conquered
her
therefore
when
the
time
came
for
the
baby
to
be
born
there
had
been
no
reconciliation
between
puritan
grange
and
folking
babington
had
been
somewhat
less
stern
immediately
on
the
return
of
the
married
couple
to
their
own
home
she
had
still
been
full
of
wrath
and
had
predicted
every
kind
of
evil
but
when
she
heard
that
all
tongues
were
saying
all
good
things
of
this
nephew
of
hers
and
when
she
was
reminded
by
her
husband
that
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
when
she
reflected
that
it
is
the
duty
of
christians
to
forgive
injuries
she
wrote
to
the
sinner
as
follows
hall
dear
john
we
are
all
here
desirous
that
bygones
should
be
bygones
and
are
willing
to
forgive
though
we
may
not
perhaps
be
able
to
forget
i
am
quite
of
opinion
that
resentments
should
not
be
lasting
let
them
have
been
ever
so
well
justified
by
circumstances
at
first
uncle
bids
me
say
that
he
hopes
you
will
come
over
and
shoot
the
puddinghall
coverts
with
humphry
and
john
they
propose
thursday
next
but
would
alter
the
day
if
that
does
not
suit
have
heard
of
your
wife
condition
of
course
and
trust
that
everything
may
go
well
with
her
i
shall
hope
to
make
her
acquaintance
some
day
when
she
is
able
to
receive
visitors
am
particularly
induced
at
the
present
moment
to
hold
out
to
you
once
more
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
family
affection
by
the
fact
that
dear
julia
is
about
to
settle
herself
most
advantageously
in
life
she
is
engaged
to
marry
the
rev
augustus
smirkie
the
rector
of
near
woodbridge
in
this
county
we
all
like
smirkie
very
much
indeed
and
think
julia
has
been
most
fortunate
in
her
these
words
were
underscored
doubly
by
way
of
showing
how
very
much
superior
was
augustus
smirkie
to
john
caldigate
may
perhaps
as
well
mention
to
avoid
anything
disagreeable
at
present
that
julia
is
at
this
time
staying
with
smirkie
mother
at
your
affectionate
aunt
babington
caldigate
was
at
first
inclined
to
send
in
answer
to
this
letter
a
reply
which
would
not
have
been
agreeable
to
his
aunt
but
was
talked
into
a
better
state
of
mind
by
his
wife
me
that
she
will
forgive
me
the
question
is
whether
i
will
forgive
her
that
be
the
question
said
his
wife
do
forgive
her
she
wants
to
come
round
and
of
course
she
has
to
make
the
best
of
it
for
herself
tell
her
from
me
that
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
her
whenever
she
chooses
to
come
julia
said
caldigate
laughing
course
you
think
so
john
that
natural
enough
perhaps
i
think
so
too
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
rather
unfortunate
that
i
know
so
much
about
smirkie
he
is
fifty
years
old
and
has
five
children
by
his
former
wife
do
see
why
he
should
be
a
good
husband
for
all
that
is
less
than
poor
dear
julia
believe
you
are
jealous
john
yes
look
at
the
way
she
has
underscored
it
of
course
jealous
nevertheless
he
wrote
a
courteous
answer
promising
to
go
over
and
shoot
the
coverts
and
stay
for
one
night
he
did
go
over
and
shoot
the
coverts
and
stayed
for
one
night
but
the
visit
was
not
very
successful
aunt
polly
would
talk
of
the
glories
of
the
rectory
in
a
manner
which
implied
that
dear
escape
from
a
fate
which
once
threatened
her
had
been
quite
providential
when
he
alluded
as
he
did
but
should
not
have
done
to
the
young
smirkies
she
spoke
with
almost
ecstatic
enthusiasm
of
the
children
caldigate
knowing
the
while
that
the
eldest
child
must
be
at
least
sixteen
and
then
though
aunt
polly
was
kind
to
him
she
was
kind
in
an
almost
insulting
manner
as
though
he
were
to
be
received
for
the
sake
of
auld
lang
syne
in
spite
of
the
step
he
had
taken
downwards
in
the
world
he
did
his
best
to
bear
all
this
with
no
more
than
an
inward
smile
telling
himself
that
it
behoved
him
as
a
man
to
allow
her
to
have
her
little
revenge
but
the
smile
was
seen
and
the
more
that
was
seen
of
it
the
more
often
was
he
reminded
that
he
had
lost
that
place
in
the
babington
elysium
which
might
have
been
his
had
he
not
been
too
foolish
to
know
what
was
good
for
him
and
a
hint
was
given
that
the
boltons
a
short
time
since
had
not
been
aristocratic
whereas
it
was
proved
to
him
from
burke
landed
gentry
that
the
smirkies
had
been
established
in
suffolk
ever
since
cromwell
time
no
doubt
their
land
had
gone
but
still
there
had
been
smirkies
did
you
get
on
with
them
his
father
asked
as
he
passed
home
through
cambridge
the
same
as
usual
of
course
in
such
a
family
a
elect
is
more
thought
of
than
a
useless
married
man
snubbed
you
polly
snubbed
me
a
little
and
i
do
think
i
had
quite
so
good
a
place
for
the
shooting
as
in
the
old
days
but
all
that
was
to
be
expected
i
quite
agree
with
aunt
polly
that
family
quarrels
are
foolish
things
am
not
so
sure
some
people
doom
themselves
to
an
infinity
of
annoyance
because
they
wo
avoid
the
society
of
disagreeable
people
i
do
know
that
i
have
ever
quarrelled
with
any
one
i
have
never
intended
to
do
so
but
when
i
find
that
a
man
or
woman
is
not
sympathetic
i
think
it
better
to
keep
out
of
the
way
that
was
the
squire
account
of
himself
those
who
knew
him
in
the
neighbourhood
were
accustomed
to
say
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
everybody
about
him
in
december
the
baby
was
born
just
twelve
months
after
the
marriage
and
there
was
great
demonstrations
of
joy
and
ringing
of
bells
in
the
parishes
of
utterden
and
netherden
the
baby
was
a
boy
and
all
was
as
it
ought
to
be
john
caldigate
himself
when
he
came
to
look
at
his
position
and
to
understand
the
feeling
of
those
around
him
was
astonished
to
find
how
strong
was
the
feeling
in
his
own
favour
and
how
thoroughly
the
tenants
had
been
outraged
by
the
idea
that
the
property
might
be
made
over
to
a
more
distant
member
of
the
family
what
was
it
to
them
who
lived
in
the
house
at
folking
why
should
they
have
been
solicitous
in
the
matter
they
had
their
leases
and
there
was
no
adequate
reason
for
supposing
that
one
caldigate
would
be
more
pleasant
in
his
dealing
with
them
than
another
and
yet
it
was
evident
to
him
now
that
this
birth
of
a
real
heir
at
the
squire
house
with
a
fair
prospect
that
the
acres
would
descend
in
a
right
line
was
regarded
by
them
all
with
almost
superstitious
satisfaction
the
bells
were
rung
as
though
the
were
going
to
be
pulled
down
and
there
was
not
a
farmer
or
a
farmer
wife
who
did
not
come
to
the
door
of
folking
to
ask
how
the
young
mother
and
the
baby
were
doing
is
as
it
should
be
squoire
said
ralph
holt
who
was
going
about
in
his
sunday
clothes
as
though
it
was
a
day
much
too
sacred
for
muck
and
work
he
had
caught
hold
of
caldigate
in
the
stable
yard
and
was
now
walking
with
him
down
towards
the
ferry
she
doing
very
well
they
tell
me
said
the
father
course
she
do
well
why
not
a
healthy
lass
like
she
if
i
may
make
so
free
there
ai
nothing
like
having
them
strong
and
young
with
no
airs
about
i
never
doubted
as
she
would
do
well
i
can
tell
from
their
very
walk
what
sort
of
mothers
they
be
holt
had
long
been
known
as
the
most
judicious
breeder
of
stock
in
that
neighbourhood
it
ai
only
that
squoire
will
do
well
too
i
hope
course
he
will
why
not
the
foals
take
after
their
dams
for
a
time
pretty
much
always
but
what
i
mean
is
we
be
all
glad
you
come
back
from
them
parts
had
to
go
there
holt
we
do
know
much
about
that
sir
and
i
do
mean
nothing
about
that
tell
the
truth
my
friend
i
should
not
have
done
very
well
here
unless
i
had
been
able
to
the
english
acres
with
a
little
australian
gold
enough
squoire
like
enough
but
i
was
making
bold
to
say
nothing
about
that
for
a
young
gentleman
to
go
out
a
while
and
then
to
come
back
was
all
very
well
most
of
does
it
but
when
there
was
a
talk
as
you
wer
to
come
back
and
that
master
george
was
to
take
the
place
why
then
it
did
seem
as
things
was
very
wrong
george
might
have
been
quite
as
good
as
i
was
the
proper
thing
squoire
it
was
straight
if
you
never
a
been
sir
or
if
the
lord
almighty
had
taken
you
as
he
did
the
others
god
bless
nobody
would
have
had
a
right
to
say
nothing
but
as
you
was
to
the
fore
it
would
have
been
straight
and
no
one
would
have
thought
it
straight
instigated
by
this
john
caldigate
looked
a
good
deal
into
the
matter
that
day
and
began
to
feel
that
having
been
born
squire
of
folking
he
had
perhaps
no
right
to
deal
with
himself
otherwise
then
various
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
as
to
other
dealings
which
had
taken
place
how
great
had
been
the
chance
against
his
being
squire
of
folking
when
he
started
with
dick
shand
to
look
for
australian
gold
and
how
little
had
been
the
chance
of
his
calling
hester
bolton
his
wife
when
he
was
pledging
his
word
to
smith
on
board
the
goldfinder
but
now
it
had
all
come
round
to
him
just
as
he
would
have
had
it
there
was
his
wife
in
the
big
with
her
baby
the
wife
as
to
whom
he
had
made
that
romantic
resolution
when
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
her
and
there
had
been
the
bells
ringing
and
the
tenants
congratulating
him
and
everything
had
been
pleasant
his
father
who
had
so
scorned
him
who
in
the
days
of
davis
and
newmarket
had
been
so
well
justified
in
scorning
him
was
now
his
closest
friend
thinking
of
all
this
he
told
himself
that
he
had
certainly
received
better
things
than
he
had
deserved
a
day
or
two
after
the
birth
of
the
baby
robert
came
out
to
see
the
new
prodigy
and
on
the
following
day
daniel
robert
was
of
course
very
friendly
and
disposed
to
be
in
all
respects
a
good
hester
great
grief
was
in
regard
to
her
mother
she
was
steadfast
enough
in
her
resolution
to
stand
in
all
respects
by
her
husband
if
there
must
be
a
separation
but
the
idea
of
the
separation
robbed
her
of
much
of
her
happiness
robert
was
aware
that
a
great
effort
was
being
made
with
bolton
the
young
respectability
was
so
great
and
his
conduct
so
good
that
not
only
the
boltons
themselves
but
neighbours
around
who
knew
aught
of
the
bolton
affairs
were
loud
in
denouncing
the
woman
for
turning
up
her
nose
at
such
a
the
great
object
was
to
induce
her
to
say
that
she
would
allow
caldigate
to
enter
the
house
at
chesterton
know
i
never
see
her
now
said
robert
too
much
of
a
sinner
to
think
of
entering
the
gates
not
laugh
at
her
margaret
said
hester
do
not
mean
to
laugh
at
her
it
is
simply
the
truth
robert
and
i
have
made
up
our
minds
that
it
is
better
for
us
all
that
i
should
not
put
myself
in
her
way
how
different
it
must
be
for
me
course
it
is
it
is
dreadful
to
think
that
she
should
be
so
prejudiced
but
what
can
i
do
dear
if
they
will
go
on
persevering
she
will
of
course
have
to
give
way
the
spoken
of
were
the
daniels
and
old
bolton
himself
and
latterly
the
nicholases
all
of
whom
were
of
opinion
that
the
separation
of
the
mother
from
her
daughter
was
very
dreadful
especially
when
it
came
to
be
understood
that
the
squire
of
folking
went
regularly
to
his
parish
church
on
the
next
day
daniel
came
out
and
though
she
was
much
less
liked
by
hester
than
her
younger
she
brought
more
comfortable
tidings
she
had
been
at
the
grange
a
day
or
two
before
and
bolton
had
almost
consented
to
say
that
she
would
see
john
caldigate
should
be
in
a
hurry
you
know
my
dear
said
daniel
what
has
john
done
that
there
should
be
any
question
about
all
this
suppose
he
was
a
little
just
a
little
what
they
call
fast
once
got
into
debt
when
he
was
a
boy
said
the
wife
then
paid
off
everything
and
a
great
deal
more
by
his
own
industry
it
seems
to
me
that
everybody
ought
to
be
proud
of
him
do
think
your
mother
is
proud
of
him
my
dear
mamma
hope
he
go
when
he
told
to
do
so
of
course
he
go
if
i
ask
him
there
nothing
he
would
do
to
make
me
happy
but
really
when
i
talk
to
him
about
it
at
all
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
poor
mamma
the
result
of
this
visit
was
however
very
comforting
daniel
had
seen
bolton
and
had
herself
been
witness
to
the
fact
that
bolton
had
mitigated
the
sternness
of
her
denial
when
asked
to
receive
her
at
puritan
grange
it
was
said
daniel
the
settled
opinion
of
the
bolton
family
that
in
the
course
of
another
month
or
so
the
woman
would
be
induced
to
give
way
under
the
pressure
put
upon
her
by
the
family
generally
chapter
xxiv
news
from
the
gold
mines
it
was
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
that
things
had
gone
on
smoothly
or
with
apparent
smoothness
at
folking
since
the
return
of
the
caldigates
from
their
wedding
tour
but
there
had
in
truth
been
a
small
cloud
in
the
folking
heavens
over
and
beyond
that
babington
haze
which
was
now
vanishing
and
the
storm
at
chesterton
as
to
which
hopes
were
entertained
that
it
would
clear
itself
away
it
will
perhaps
be
remembered
that
caldigate
offer
for
the
sale
of
his
interest
in
the
polyeuka
mine
had
been
suddenly
accepted
by
certain
enterprising
persons
in
australia
and
that
the
money
itself
had
been
absolutely
forthcoming
this
had
been
in
every
way
fortunate
as
he
had
been
saved
from
the
trouble
of
another
journey
to
the
colony
and
his
money
matters
had
been
put
on
such
a
footing
as
to
make
him
altogether
comfortable
but
just
when
he
heard
that
the
money
had
been
lodged
to
his
account
and
when
the
money
actually
had
been
so
paid
he
received
a
telegram
from
crinkett
begging
that
the
matter
might
be
for
a
time
postponed
this
of
course
was
out
of
the
question
his
terms
had
been
accepted
which
might
have
gone
for
very
little
had
not
the
money
been
forthcoming
but
the
cash
was
positively
in
his
hands
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
an
arrangement
in
such
circumstances
let
them
do
what
they
might
with
polyeuka
he
was
safe
he
telegraphed
back
to
say
that
there
could
be
no
postponement
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
whole
thing
was
settled
then
there
came
a
multiplicity
of
telegrams
very
costly
to
the
crinkett
interest
costly
also
and
troublesome
to
himself
for
he
though
the
matter
was
so
pleasantly
settled
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
could
not
altogether
ignore
the
plaints
that
were
made
to
him
then
there
came
very
long
letters
long
and
loud
letters
not
only
from
crinkett
but
from
others
telling
him
that
the
polyeuka
gold
had
come
to
an
end
the
lode
disappearing
altogether
as
lodes
sometimes
do
disappear
the
fact
was
that
the
crinkett
company
asked
to
have
back
half
its
money
offering
him
the
polyeuka
mine
in
its
entirety
if
he
chose
to
accept
it
john
caldigate
though
in
england
he
could
be
and
was
a
liberal
gentleman
had
been
long
enough
in
australia
to
know
that
if
he
meant
to
hold
his
own
among
such
men
as
crinkett
he
must
make
the
best
of
such
turns
of
fortune
as
chance
might
give
him
under
no
circumstances
would
crinkett
have
been
generous
to
him
had
polyeuka
suddenly
become
more
prolific
in
the
precious
metal
than
any
mine
in
the
colony
the
crinkett
company
would
have
laughed
at
any
claim
made
by
him
for
further
payment
when
a
bargain
has
been
fairly
made
the
parties
must
make
the
best
of
it
he
was
therefore
very
decided
in
his
refusal
to
make
restitution
though
he
was
at
the
same
time
profuse
in
his
expressions
of
sorrow
then
there
came
a
threat
not
from
crinkett
but
from
euphemia
smith
and
the
letter
was
not
signed
euphemia
smith
but
euphemia
caldigate
and
the
letter
was
as
follows
spite
of
all
your
treachery
to
me
i
do
not
wish
to
ruin
you
or
to
destroy
your
young
wife
by
proving
myself
in
england
to
have
been
married
to
you
at
ahalala
but
i
will
do
so
unless
you
assent
to
the
terms
which
crinkett
has
proposed
he
and
i
are
in
partnership
in
the
matter
with
two
or
three
others
and
are
willing
to
let
all
that
has
gone
before
be
forgotten
if
we
have
means
given
us
to
make
another
start
you
can
not
feel
that
the
money
you
have
received
is
fairly
yours
and
i
can
hardly
think
you
would
wish
to
become
rich
by
taking
from
me
all
that
i
have
earned
after
so
many
hardships
if
you
will
do
as
i
propose
you
had
better
send
out
an
agent
on
paying
us
the
money
he
shall
not
only
have
the
but
shall
stand
by
and
see
me
married
to
crinkett
who
is
now
a
widower
after
that
of
course
i
can
make
no
claim
to
you
if
you
will
not
do
this
both
i
and
crinkett
and
the
other
man
who
was
present
at
our
marriage
and
anne
young
who
has
been
with
me
ever
since
will
go
at
once
to
england
and
the
law
must
take
its
course
have
no
scruple
in
demanding
this
as
you
owe
me
so
much
more
the
wesleyan
who
married
us
has
gone
out
of
the
colony
no
one
knows
where
but
i
send
you
the
copy
of
the
certificate
and
all
the
four
of
us
who
were
there
are
still
together
and
there
were
others
who
were
at
ahalala
at
the
time
and
who
remember
the
marriage
well
dick
shand
was
not
in
the
chapel
but
dick
knew
all
about
it
there
is
quite
plenty
of
evidence
back
by
the
wire
word
what
you
will
do
and
let
your
agent
come
over
as
soon
as
possible
caldigate
however
true
or
however
false
the
allegations
made
in
the
above
letter
may
have
been
for
a
time
it
stunned
him
greatly
this
letter
reached
him
about
a
month
before
the
birth
of
his
son
and
for
a
day
or
two
it
disturbed
him
greatly
he
did
not
show
it
to
his
wife
but
wandered
about
the
place
alone
thinking
whether
he
would
take
any
notice
of
it
and
what
notice
at
last
he
resolved
that
he
would
take
the
letter
to
his
robert
and
ask
the
attorney
advice
much
of
it
is
true
demanded
robert
when
he
read
the
letter
twice
from
beginning
to
end
good
deal
said
caldigate
much
as
may
be
with
the
exception
that
i
was
never
married
to
the
woman
suppose
not
that
robert
bolton
as
he
spoke
was
very
grave
but
did
not
at
first
seem
disposed
to
be
angry
you
not
better
tell
me
everything
do
you
think
is
for
that
purpose
that
i
have
come
and
brought
you
the
letter
you
understand
about
the
money
suppose
so
can
be
no
reason
why
i
should
return
a
penny
of
it
not
now
you
certainly
must
not
return
it
under
a
threat
even
though
the
woman
should
be
starving
there
can
be
no
circumstances
and
as
he
spoke
he
dashed
his
hand
down
upon
the
table
circumstances
in
which
a
man
should
allow
money
to
be
extorted
from
him
by
a
threat
for
hester
sake
you
must
not
do
that
no
i
must
not
do
that
of
course
now
tell
me
what
is
true
there
was
something
of
authority
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
something
perhaps
of
censure
something
too
of
doubt
which
went
much
against
the
grain
with
caldigate
he
had
determined
to
tell
his
story
feeling
that
counsel
was
necessary
to
him
but
he
wished
so
to
tell
it
as
to
subject
himself
to
no
criticism
and
to
admit
no
fault
he
wanted
assistance
but
he
wanted
it
on
friendly
and
sympathetic
terms
he
had
a
great
dislike
to
being
up
as
he
would
probably
have
expressed
it
himself
and
he
already
thought
that
he
saw
in
his
companion
eye
a
tendency
that
way
turning
all
this
in
his
mind
he
paused
a
moment
before
he
began
to
tell
his
tale
say
that
a
good
deal
in
this
woman
letter
is
true
had
you
not
better
tell
me
what
is
true
was
very
intimate
with
her
she
ever
live
with
you
she
did
your
wife
yes
it
is
of
course
best
that
you
should
know
all
then
he
gave
a
tolerably
true
account
of
all
that
had
happened
between
himself
and
smith
up
to
the
time
at
which
as
the
reader
knows
he
found
her
performing
at
the
sydney
theatre
had
made
her
a
distinct
promise
of
marriage
on
board
the
ship
think
i
had
think
i
think
i
did
can
you
not
understand
that
a
man
may
be
in
great
doubt
as
to
the
exact
words
that
he
may
have
spoken
at
such
a
time
i
do
think
you
realise
the
man
position
i
wish
to
let
you
know
the
truth
as
exactly
as
i
can
you
had
better
take
it
for
granted
that
i
did
make
such
a
promise
though
probably
no
such
promise
was
absolutely
uttered
but
i
did
tell
her
afterwards
that
i
would
marry
her
when
she
followed
me
up
to
ahalala
richard
shand
know
her
course
he
did
on
board
the
ship
and
he
was
with
me
when
she
came
to
ahalala
she
lived
with
you
you
promised
to
marry
her
was
that
all
did
not
marry
her
of
course
said
caldigate
heard
the
promise
was
declared
by
her
in
the
presence
of
that
wesleyan
minister
she
speaks
of
he
went
to
her
to
rebuke
her
and
she
told
him
of
the
promise
then
he
asked
me
and
i
did
not
deny
it
at
the
moment
when
he
taxed
me
with
it
i
was
almost
minded
to
do
as
i
had
promised
repeated
your
promise
then
to
him
of
the
kind
i
did
not
deny
it
and
i
told
him
at
last
to
mind
his
own
business
life
up
there
was
a
little
rough
at
that
time
it
seems
indeed
and
then
after
that
had
given
her
money
and
she
had
some
claims
in
a
when
she
was
successful
for
a
time
she
became
so
keen
about
her
money
that
i
fancy
she
hardly
wished
to
get
herself
married
then
we
had
some
words
and
so
we
parted
she
call
herself
mrs
caldigate
never
called
her
so
she
herself
assume
the
name
was
a
wild
kind
of
life
up
there
robert
and
this
was
apparent
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
names
people
used
i
daresay
some
of
the
people
did
call
her
caldigate
but
they
knew
she
was
not
my
wife
this
man
crinkett
knew
all
about
it
had
a
wife
did
his
wife
know
her
had
quarrelled
with
his
wife
at
that
time
and
had
sent
her
away
from
nobble
smith
was
then
living
at
nobble
and
crinkett
knew
more
about
her
than
i
did
she
was
mad
after
gold
and
it
was
with
crinkett
she
was
working
i
gave
her
a
lot
of
shares
in
another
mine
to
leave
me
mine
old
they
called
it
i
had
been
in
partnership
with
crinkett
and
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
thing
and
go
in
altogether
for
polyeuka
at
that
time
the
woman
cared
little
for
husbands
or
lovers
she
had
been
bitten
with
the
fury
of
and
like
so
many
of
them
filled
her
mind
with
an
idea
of
unlimited
wealth
and
she
had
a
turn
of
luck
i
suppose
she
was
worth
at
one
time
eight
or
ten
thousand
pounds
she
did
not
keep
it
knew
but
little
of
her
afterwards
i
kept
out
of
her
way
and
though
i
had
dealings
with
crinkett
i
dropped
them
as
soon
as
i
could
then
he
paused
but
robert
bolton
held
his
peace
with
anything
but
a
satisfied
countenance
i
think
you
know
all
about
it
is
a
most
distressing
story
attempts
at
robbery
and
imposition
are
of
course
distressing
is
so
much
in
it
that
is
disgraceful
deny
it
altogether
if
you
mean
disgraceful
to
me
it
had
all
been
known
as
it
is
known
now
as
it
is
known
even
by
your
own
telling
do
you
think
that
i
should
have
consented
to
your
marriage
with
my
sister
not
robert
bolton
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
think
moreover
that
had
you
refused
your
consent
i
should
have
married
your
sister
just
the
same
you
know
very
little
about
the
matter
do
think
there
can
be
any
good
in
going
into
that
it
is
at
any
rate
the
fact
that
your
sister
is
my
wife
as
this
demand
has
been
made
upon
me
it
was
natural
that
i
should
wish
to
discuss
it
with
some
one
whom
i
can
trust
i
tell
you
all
the
facts
but
i
am
not
going
to
listen
to
any
as
to
my
past
life
hester
is
she
poor
she
does
not
think
herself
so
there
is
a
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
before
her
and
because
all
that
you
have
told
to
me
must
probably
be
made
known
to
her
knows
it
already
that
is
she
knows
what
you
mean
i
have
not
told
her
of
the
woman
lie
nor
of
this
demand
for
money
but
i
shall
when
she
is
strong
enough
to
hear
it
and
to
talk
of
it
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
that
there
are
secrets
between
me
and
hester
do
suppose
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
the
story
of
such
a
life
told
in
all
the
public
papers
not
but
it
will
be
an
annoyance
which
i
can
bear
you
or
any
one
else
would
be
very
much
mistaken
who
would
suppose
that
life
out
in
those
places
can
go
on
in
the
same
regular
way
that
it
does
here
gold
beneath
the
ground
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
touch
and
few
who
have
had
to
do
with
it
have
come
out
much
freer
from
misfortune
than
myself
as
for
these
people
i
do
suppose
that
i
shall
hear
from
them
again
i
shall
send
them
both
word
that
not
a
shilling
is
to
be
expected
from
me
there
was
after
this
a
long
discussion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
messages
to
be
sent
there
was
no
absolute
quarrel
between
the
two
men
and
the
attorney
acknowledged
to
himself
that
it
was
now
his
duty
to
give
the
best
advice
in
his
power
to
his
but
their
manner
to
each
other
was
changed
it
was
evident
that
robert
did
not
quite
believe
all
that
caldigate
told
him
and
evident
also
that
caldigate
resented
this
want
of
confidence
but
still
each
knew
that
he
could
not
do
without
the
other
their
connection
was
too
firm
and
too
close
to
be
shaken
off
and
therefore
though
their
tones
were
hardly
friendly
still
they
consulted
as
to
what
should
be
done
it
was
at
last
decided
that
two
messages
should
be
sent
by
caldigate
one
to
crinkett
and
the
other
to
smith
and
each
in
the
same
words
money
will
be
sent
you
on
behalf
of
the
polyeuka
mine
and
that
this
should
be
all
any
letter
robert
bolton
thought
would
be
inexpedient
then
they
parted
and
the
two
messages
were
at
once
sent
after
a
day
or
two
caldigate
recovered
his
spirits
we
all
probably
know
how
some
trouble
will
come
upon
us
and
for
a
period
seem
to
quell
all
that
is
joyous
in
our
life
and
that
then
by
quick
degrees
the
weight
of
the
trouble
will
grow
less
till
the
natural
spring
and
vivacity
of
the
mind
will
recover
itself
and
make
little
or
nothing
of
that
which
a
few
hours
ago
was
felt
to
be
so
grievous
a
burden
so
it
had
been
with
john
caldigate
he
had
been
man
enough
to
hold
up
his
head
when
telling
his
story
to
robert
bolton
and
to
declare
that
the
annoyance
would
be
one
that
he
could
bear
easily
but
still
for
some
hours
after
that
he
had
been
unhappy
if
by
sacrificing
some
considerable
sum
of
money
even
a
large
sum
of
money
say
ten
thousand
pounds
he
could
at
that
moment
have
insured
the
silence
of
crinkett
and
the
woman
he
would
have
paid
his
money
he
knew
the
world
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
he
could
insure
nothing
by
any
such
sacrifice
he
must
defy
these
claimants
and
then
if
they
chose
to
come
to
england
with
their
story
he
must
bear
it
as
best
he
could
those
who
saw
him
did
not
know
that
aught
ailed
him
and
robert
bolton
spoke
no
word
of
the
matter
to
any
one
at
cambridge
but
robert
bolton
thought
very
much
of
it
so
much
that
on
the
following
day
he
ran
up
to
london
on
purpose
to
discuss
the
matter
with
his
brother
william
how
would
it
be
with
them
and
what
would
be
his
duty
if
the
statement
made
by
the
woman
should
turn
out
to
be
true
what
security
had
they
after
the
story
told
by
caldigate
himself
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
by
his
own
showing
he
had
lived
with
the
woman
had
promised
to
marry
her
had
acknowledged
his
promise
in
the
hearing
of
a
clergyman
and
had
been
aware
that
she
had
called
herself
by
his
name
then
he
had
given
her
money
to
go
away
this
had
been
his
own
story
you
believe
him
he
said
to
his
brother
william
i
do
in
the
first
place
though
i
can
understand
from
his
antecedents
and
from
his
surroundings
at
the
time
that
he
should
have
lived
a
loose
sort
of
life
when
he
was
out
there
i
do
think
that
he
is
a
rascal
or
even
a
liar
would
wish
to
think
so
do
not
think
so
he
does
look
like
it
or
talk
like
it
or
act
like
it
many
cases
do
we
know
in
which
some
abominable
unexpected
villainy
has
destroyed
the
happiness
and
respectability
of
a
family
what
would
you
do
asked
the
barrister
is
married
to
him
you
can
not
separate
them
if
you
would
poor
girl
if
it
be
so
her
misery
is
accomplished
but
if
it
be
so
she
should
at
once
be
taken
away
from
him
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
to
her
mother
that
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
robert
nevertheless
true
think
of
her
warnings
and
refusals
and
of
my
persistence
but
if
it
be
so
not
the
less
must
we
all
insist
upon
destroying
him
if
it
be
so
he
must
be
punished
to
the
extent
of
the
law
william
bolton
however
would
not
admit
that
it
could
be
so
and
robert
declared
that
though
he
suspected
though
in
such
a
case
he
found
himself
bound
to
suspect
he
did
not
in
truth
believe
that
caldigate
had
been
guilty
of
so
terrible
a
crime
all
probability
was
against
it
but
still
it
was
possible
then
after
much
deliberation
it
was
decided
that
an
agent
should
be
sent
out
by
them
to
new
south
wales
to
learn
the
truth
as
far
as
it
could
be
learned
and
to
bring
back
whatever
evidence
might
be
collected
without
making
too
much
noise
in
the
collection
of
it
then
there
arose
the
question
whether
caldigate
should
be
told
of
this
but
it
was
decided
that
it
should
be
done
at
the
joint
expense
of
the
two
brothers
without
the
knowledge
of
husband
chapter
xxv
the
baby
sponsors
there
anything
wrong
between
you
and
robert
hester
asked
this
question
of
her
husband
one
morning
in
january
as
he
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
her
sofa
in
their
bedroom
the
baby
was
in
her
arms
and
at
that
moment
there
was
a
question
as
to
the
godfathers
and
godmother
for
the
baby
the
letter
from
smith
had
arrived
on
the
last
day
of
october
nearly
two
months
before
the
birth
of
the
baby
and
the
telegrams
refusing
to
send
the
money
demanded
had
been
despatched
on
the
november
so
that
at
this
time
caldigate
mind
was
accustomed
to
the
burden
of
the
idea
from
that
day
to
this
he
had
not
often
spoken
of
the
matter
to
robert
bolton
nor
indeed
had
there
been
much
conversation
between
them
on
other
matters
robert
had
asked
him
two
or
three
times
whether
he
had
received
any
reply
by
the
wires
no
such
message
had
come
and
of
course
he
answered
his
questions
accordingly
but
he
had
answered
them
almost
with
a
look
of
offence
the
attorney
manner
and
tone
seemed
to
him
to
convey
reproach
and
he
was
determined
that
none
of
the
boltons
should
have
the
liberty
to
find
fault
with
him
it
had
been
suggested
some
weeks
since
before
the
baby
was
born
that
an
effort
should
be
made
to
induce
bolton
to
act
as
godmother
and
since
that
among
the
names
of
many
other
relatives
and
friends
those
of
uncle
babington
and
robert
bolton
had
been
proposed
hester
had
been
particularly
anxious
that
her
brother
should
be
asked
because
as
she
so
often
said
to
her
husband
he
had
always
been
her
firm
friend
in
the
matter
of
her
marriage
but
now
when
the
question
was
to
be
settled
john
caldigate
shook
his
head
was
afraid
there
was
something
even
before
baby
was
born
said
the
wife
is
something
my
pet
is
it
john
you
do
not
mean
to
keep
it
secret
from
me
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
your
asking
him
to
stand
but
i
think
it
possible
that
he
may
refuse
should
he
refuse
as
you
say
there
is
something
wrong
between
us
there
have
been
applications
for
money
about
the
polyeuka
mine
i
would
not
trouble
you
about
it
while
you
were
he
think
you
ought
to
give
back
the
money
not
that
we
are
quite
agreed
about
the
money
but
another
question
has
come
up
and
though
we
are
i
believe
agreed
about
that
too
still
there
has
been
something
a
little
uncomfortable
not
baby
make
that
all
right
think
if
you
were
to
ask
your
brother
william
it
would
be
better
i
not
know
what
it
is
now
john
have
meant
you
to
know
always
from
the
moment
when
it
occurred
when
you
should
be
well
enough
am
well
now
hardly
know
and
yet
i
can
not
bear
to
keep
it
secret
from
you
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
made
her
feel
at
once
that
the
subject
to
which
he
alluded
was
of
the
greatest
importance
whether
weak
or
strong
of
course
she
must
be
told
now
let
the
shock
of
the
tidings
be
what
it
might
the
doubt
would
be
worse
she
felt
all
that
and
she
knew
that
he
could
feel
it
am
quite
strong
she
said
must
tell
me
now
baby
asleep
put
him
in
the
cradle
it
so
bad
as
that
do
not
say
that
it
is
bad
at
all
there
is
nothing
bad
in
it
except
a
lie
let
me
put
him
in
the
cradle
then
he
took
the
child
very
gently
and
deposited
him
fast
asleep
among
the
blankets
he
had
already
assumed
for
himself
the
character
of
being
a
good
male
nurse
and
she
was
always
delighted
when
she
saw
the
baby
in
his
arms
then
he
came
and
seated
himself
close
to
her
on
the
sofa
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
is
nothing
bad
but
a
lie
lie
may
be
so
very
bad
indeed
and
this
lie
is
very
bad
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
about
a
woman
smith
the
dancing
woman
her
course
i
remember
was
one
of
those
it
seems
who
bought
the
polyeuka
mine
indeed
with
crinkett
and
others
now
they
want
their
money
back
again
can
they
make
you
send
it
and
would
it
be
very
bad
to
lose
it
can
not
make
me
send
it
they
have
no
claim
to
a
single
shilling
and
if
they
could
make
me
pay
it
that
would
not
be
very
bad
is
it
then
you
are
afraid
to
tell
me
my
darling
afraid
to
speak
to
you
of
what
is
so
wicked
afraid
to
shock
you
to
disgust
you
but
not
afraid
of
any
injury
that
can
be
done
to
you
no
harm
will
come
to
you
to
you
to
me
none
to
you
or
to
me
or
to
baby
there
as
he
said
this
she
clutched
his
hand
with
hers
harm
dearest
and
yet
the
thing
is
so
abominable
that
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
wound
your
ears
with
it
must
tell
now
john
i
must
tell
you
i
have
thought
about
it
much
and
i
know
that
it
is
better
that
you
should
be
told
he
had
thought
much
about
it
and
had
so
resolved
but
he
had
not
quite
known
how
difficult
the
telling
would
be
and
now
he
was
aware
that
he
was
adding
to
the
horror
she
would
feel
by
pausing
and
making
much
of
the
thing
and
yet
he
could
not
tell
it
as
though
it
were
a
light
matter
if
he
could
have
declared
it
all
at
once
at
first
with
a
smile
on
his
face
then
expressing
his
disgust
at
the
woman
falsehood
it
would
have
been
better
woman
has
written
me
a
letter
in
which
she
declares
herself
to
be
my
wife
wife
john
your
wife
these
exclamations
came
from
her
almost
with
a
shriek
as
she
jumped
up
from
his
arms
and
for
a
moment
stood
before
him
back
to
me
he
said
then
again
she
seated
herself
did
not
leave
me
then
because
you
doubted
me
no
she
cried
throwing
herself
upon
him
and
smothering
him
with
kisses
no
it
was
surprise
at
such
horrid
words
not
doubt
not
doubt
of
you
i
will
never
doubt
you
was
because
i
was
sure
of
you
that
i
have
ventured
to
tell
you
this
may
be
sure
of
me
she
said
sobbing
violently
the
while
are
sure
of
me
are
you
not
and
now
tell
it
me
all
how
did
she
say
so
why
did
she
say
so
is
she
coming
to
claim
you
tell
me
all
oh
john
tell
me
everything
why
is
soon
told
because
she
wants
money
she
had
heard
no
doubt
of
my
marriage
and
thought
to
frighten
me
out
of
money
i
do
not
think
she
would
do
it
herself
the
man
crinkett
has
put
her
up
to
it
does
she
say
that
and
then
she
signs
herself
euphemia
caldigate
john
you
know
it
all
i
not
see
the
letter
what
good
but
you
shall
see
it
if
you
wish
it
i
have
determined
that
nothing
shall
be
kept
back
from
you
in
all
that
there
may
ever
be
to
trouble
us
the
best
comfort
will
be
in
perfect
confidence
he
had
already
learned
enough
of
her
nature
to
be
sure
that
in
this
way
would
he
best
comfort
her
and
most
certainly
ensure
her
trust
in
himself
yes
she
cried
you
will
tell
me
all
i
will
never
doubt
you
then
she
took
the
letter
from
his
hand
and
attempted
to
read
it
but
her
excitement
was
so
great
that
though
the
words
were
written
very
clearly
she
could
not
bring
her
mind
to
understand
them
ruin
married
to
you
what
is
it
all
do
you
read
it
to
me
every
word
of
it
then
he
did
read
it
every
word
of
it
says
that
she
will
marry
the
other
man
how
can
she
marry
him
when
she
says
that
she
is
your
wife
so
my
pet
but
you
see
what
she
says
it
does
not
matter
much
to
her
whether
it
be
true
or
false
so
that
she
can
get
my
money
from
me
but
hester
i
would
fain
be
just
even
to
her
no
doubt
she
wrote
the
letter
else
would
have
written
it
wrote
it
i
know
her
hand
and
these
are
her
words
because
they
are
properly
expressed
but
it
is
all
his
doing
the
man
doing
he
has
got
her
in
his
power
and
he
is
using
her
in
this
way
you
sent
her
money
a
shilling
not
though
she
were
starving
not
now
a
man
who
gives
money
under
a
threat
is
gone
if
i
were
to
send
her
money
everyone
would
believe
this
tale
that
she
tells
your
brother
robert
would
believe
it
knows
it
took
the
letter
to
him
instantly
but
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
show
it
you
till
baby
was
born
you
can
understand
that
she
only
pressed
closer
to
him
as
he
said
this
showed
it
to
robert
and
altogether
we
are
not
quite
such
friends
since
as
we
were
before
do
not
mean
that
he
believes
it
not
that
he
does
not
believe
it
if
he
did
i
do
not
see
how
he
and
i
could
ever
speak
to
each
other
again
i
do
think
he
believes
it
at
all
but
i
had
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
and
that
perhaps
offended
him
the
story
had
not
been
told
to
hester
nor
did
he
think
it
necessary
that
it
should
be
told
there
was
no
reason
why
these
details
which
robert
had
elicited
by
his
questions
should
be
repeated
to
her
the
promise
of
marriage
the
interference
of
the
wesleyan
minister
the
use
made
of
his
name
of
all
this
he
said
nothing
but
she
had
now
been
told
that
which
to
her
had
been
very
dreadful
and
she
was
not
surprised
that
her
brother
should
have
been
offended
when
he
heard
the
same
sad
story
she
of
course
had
at
once
pardoned
the
old
offence
a
young
wife
when
she
is
sure
of
her
husband
will
readily
forgive
all
offences
committed
before
marriage
and
will
almost
be
thankful
for
the
confidence
placed
in
her
when
offences
are
confessed
but
she
could
understand
that
a
brother
could
not
be
thankful
and
she
would
naturally
exaggerate
in
her
own
mind
the
horror
which
he
would
feel
at
such
a
revelation
then
the
husband
endeavoured
to
lighten
the
effect
of
what
he
had
said
perhaps
is
the
wrong
word
but
he
was
stiff
and
masterful
if
you
know
what
i
mean
would
not
bear
that
certainly
john
i
have
to
own
that
i
do
not
love
the
assumption
of
authority
except
from
you
do
not
like
it
from
anybody
john
would
not
wish
me
to
submit
myself
to
your
brother
but
i
think
i
might
ask
him
to
be
baby
godfather
you
please
only
you
would
be
unhappy
if
he
refused
then
there
came
a
little
wail
from
the
cradle
and
the
baby
was
taken
up
and
for
some
minutes
his
little
necessities
occupied
the
mother
to
the
exclusion
even
of
that
terrible
letter
but
when
caldigate
was
about
to
leave
the
room
she
asked
him
another
question
she
do
anything
more
john
can
hardly
say
i
should
think
not
does
robert
think
has
not
told
me
i
sent
an
immediate
refusal
by
the
telegraph
wires
and
have
heard
nothing
since
he
nervous
about
it
hardly
know
it
dwells
in
his
mind
no
doubt
you
nervous
dwells
in
my
mind
that
is
all
i
speak
to
him
about
it
should
you
what
good
would
it
do
i
would
rather
you
did
not
nevertheless
if
you
feel
frightened
if
you
think
that
there
is
anything
wrong
it
will
be
natural
that
you
should
go
to
him
for
assistance
i
will
not
forbid
it
as
he
said
this
he
stood
back
away
from
her
it
was
but
by
a
foot
or
two
but
still
there
was
a
sign
of
separation
which
instantly
made
itself
palpable
to
her
how
wrong
she
said
following
him
and
clinging
to
him
do
not
suppose
that
i
would
go
to
him
because
i
think
you
wrong
do
you
not
know
that
whatever
might
come
i
should
cling
to
you
what
is
he
to
me
compared
to
you
no
i
will
never
speak
to
him
about
it
he
returned
her
caress
with
fervour
and
stroked
her
hair
and
kissed
her
forehead
dearest
my
own
my
darling
but
what
i
mean
is
that
if
some
other
man
opinion
on
this
subject
is
necessary
to
your
comfort
you
may
go
to
him
other
man
opinion
shall
be
necessary
to
me
about
anything
i
will
not
speak
about
it
to
robert
or
to
any
one
but
if
more
should
come
of
it
you
will
tell
me
shall
know
everything
that
comes
i
have
never
for
a
moment
had
the
idea
of
keeping
it
back
from
you
but
because
of
baby
and
because
baby
had
to
be
born
i
delayed
it
this
was
an
excuse
which
as
the
mother
of
her
child
she
could
not
but
accept
with
thankfulness
think
i
will
ask
him
she
said
that
night
referring
again
to
the
vexed
question
of
godfathers
uncle
babington
had
some
weeks
since
very
generously
offered
his
services
and
of
course
they
had
been
generously
accepted
among
the
baby
relations
he
was
the
man
of
highest
standing
in
the
world
and
then
this
was
a
mark
of
absolute
forgiveness
in
reference
to
the
wrongs
of
poor
julia
and
a
long
letter
had
been
prepared
to
bolton
written
by
hester
own
hand
not
without
much
trouble
in
which
the
baby
grandmother
was
urged
to
take
upon
herself
the
duties
of
godmother
all
this
had
been
discussed
in
the
family
so
that
the
nature
of
the
petition
was
well
known
to
bolton
for
some
time
before
she
received
it
daniel
who
had
consented
to
act
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
from
puritan
grange
had
more
than
once
used
her
influence
with
her
but
no
hint
had
as
yet
come
to
folking
as
to
what
the
answer
might
be
it
had
also
been
suggested
that
robert
should
be
the
other
godfather
the
proposal
having
been
made
to
robert
but
there
had
come
upon
all
the
boltons
a
feeling
that
robert
was
indifferent
perhaps
even
unwilling
to
undertake
the
task
and
yet
no
one
knew
why
robert
herself
did
not
know
why
the
reader
however
will
know
why
and
will
understand
how
it
was
that
robert
was
in
the
dark
the
attorney
though
he
was
suspicious
though
he
was
frightened
though
he
was
in
truth
very
angry
with
this
new
through
whose
delinquencies
so
much
sorrow
was
threatened
to
the
bolton
family
nevertheless
kept
the
secret
from
all
the
cambridge
boltons
it
had
been
necessary
to
him
to
seek
counsel
with
some
one
but
he
had
mentioned
the
matter
only
to
his
brother
william
but
he
did
not
wish
to
add
to
the
bond
which
now
tied
him
to
folking
if
this
horror
this
possible
horror
should
fall
upon
them
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
had
insisted
on
giving
his
sister
in
marriage
to
a
man
already
married
then
then
then
such
possible
future
incidents
were
too
terrible
to
be
considered
closely
but
with
such
a
possibility
he
would
not
add
to
the
bonds
at
puritan
grange
they
would
throw
all
the
responsibility
of
what
had
been
done
upon
him
this
feeling
was
mingled
with
his
love
for
his
sister
with
the
indignation
he
would
not
only
feel
but
show
if
it
should
turn
out
that
she
had
been
wronged
will
destroy
him
i
will
destroy
him
utterly
he
would
sometimes
say
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
it
and
now
the
godfather
question
had
to
be
decided
he
said
to
his
wife
do
care
about
such
things
i
wo
do
it
you
write
and
tell
her
that
i
have
prejudices
or
scruples
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
is
to
be
a
little
tarradiddle
told
and
i
am
to
tell
it
have
prejudices
and
scruples
the
religion
of
the
thing
she
knew
as
of
course
she
was
bound
to
know
that
he
had
at
any
rate
a
round
dozen
of
somewhere
about
the
country
there
were
the
young
williams
and
the
young
daniels
and
her
own
nephews
and
nieces
with
the
parents
of
all
of
whom
uncle
robert
had
been
regarded
as
the
very
man
for
a
godfather
the
silversmith
in
trumpington
street
knew
exactly
the
weight
of
the
silver
cup
that
was
to
be
given
to
the
boy
or
to
a
girl
the
bible
and
were
equally
well
regulated
robert
could
not
but
smile
at
the
idea
of
religious
scruples
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
that
has
come
over
you
of
late
i
fancy
you
have
quarrelled
with
john
caldigate
you
think
that
then
you
can
understand
the
reason
is
it
about
have
not
quarrelled
with
him
it
is
possible
that
i
may
have
to
do
so
but
i
do
not
mean
to
say
what
it
is
about
then
he
smiled
want
you
to
ask
any
more
questions
but
just
to
write
to
hester
as
kindly
as
you
can
saying
i
do
mean
to
be
godfather
any
more
it
will
be
a
good
excuse
in
regard
to
all
future
babies
robert
was
a
good
wife
and
did
as
she
was
bid
she
worded
her
refusal
as
cautiously
as
she
could
and
on
that
occasion
asked
her
husband
no
further
question
the
prayer
that
was
addressed
to
the
lady
of
puritan
grange
became
the
subject
of
much
debate
of
great
consideration
and
i
may
say
also
of
lengthened
prayer
to
bolton
this
position
of
godmother
implied
much
of
the
old
sacred
responsibility
which
was
formerly
attached
to
it
and
which
robert
bolton
like
other
godfathers
and
godmothers
of
the
day
had
altogether
ignored
she
had
been
already
partly
brought
round
nearly
persuaded
in
regard
to
the
acceptance
of
john
caldigate
as
her
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
do
other
than
hate
him
how
was
it
possible
that
such
a
woman
should
do
other
than
hate
the
man
who
had
altogether
got
the
better
of
her
as
to
the
very
marrow
of
her
life
the
very
apple
of
her
eye
but
she
was
alive
to
her
duty
towards
her
daughter
and
when
she
was
told
that
the
man
was
honest
in
his
dealings
in
the
world
a
professing
christian
who
was
constant
in
his
parish
church
she
did
not
know
how
to
maintain
her
opinion
that
in
spite
of
all
this
he
was
an
unregenerate
castaway
therefore
although
she
was
determined
still
to
hate
him
she
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
enter
his
house
with
these
ideas
she
wrote
a
long
letter
to
hester
in
which
she
promised
to
have
herself
taken
out
to
folking
in
order
that
she
might
be
present
as
godmother
at
the
baby
baptism
she
would
lunch
at
folking
but
must
return
to
chesterton
before
dinner
even
this
was
a
great
thing
gained
then
it
was
arranged
that
daniel
bolton
should
stand
as
second
godfather
in
place
of
his
brother
robert
chapter
xxvi
a
stranger
in
cambridge
am
sorry
you
will
not
come
out
to
us
on
the
day
before
the
christening
which
was
at
last
fixed
for
a
certain
tuesday
in
the
middle
of
february
john
caldigate
went
into
cambridge
and
at
once
called
upon
the
attorney
at
his
office
this
he
did
partly
instigated
by
his
own
feelings
and
partly
in
compliance
with
his
wife
wishes
before
that
letter
had
come
he
and
his
had
been
fast
friends
and
now
though
for
a
day
or
two
he
had
been
angry
with
what
he
had
thought
to
be
unjustifiable
interference
he
regretted
the
loss
of
such
a
friend
more
than
three
months
had
now
passed
since
the
letter
had
come
but
his
mind
was
far
from
being
at
ease
and
he
felt
that
if
trouble
should
come
it
would
be
very
well
for
him
to
have
robert
bolton
on
his
side
is
going
said
the
attorney
do
you
not
bring
her
are
days
with
me
my
boy
i
ca
afford
to
give
up
a
morning
for
every
baby
that
is
born
of
course
may
be
true
and
if
that
is
the
reason
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
as
he
spoke
he
looked
in
his
face
so
as
almost
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
continued
pretence
caldigate
it
is
the
reason
altogether
said
the
other
you
would
have
allowed
it
to
pass
without
further
explanation
so
would
i
but
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
in
so
many
words
i
will
confess
that
i
would
rather
not
go
out
to
folking
till
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
no
more
troubled
by
your
friends
in
australia
not
why
should
you
not
go
out
to
folking
because
i
may
have
to
take
an
active
part
against
you
i
do
not
suppose
it
will
come
to
that
but
it
is
possible
i
need
not
say
that
i
trust
there
may
be
nothing
of
the
kind
but
i
can
not
be
sure
it
is
on
the
cards
think
that
is
a
hard
judgment
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
believe
that
woman
statement
not
only
against
mine
but
against
the
whole
tenor
of
my
life
and
character
i
do
not
believe
the
woman
statement
if
i
did
i
should
not
be
talking
to
you
now
the
woman
has
probably
lied
and
is
probably
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
others
for
raising
money
as
you
have
already
suggested
but
according
to
your
own
showing
there
has
been
much
in
your
life
to
authorise
the
statement
i
do
not
know
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
a
marriage
there
laws
are
the
same
as
ours
at
any
rate
you
are
wrong
their
marriage
laws
are
not
the
same
as
ours
though
how
they
may
differ
you
and
i
probably
do
not
accurately
know
and
they
may
be
altered
at
any
time
as
they
may
please
let
the
laws
be
what
they
will
it
is
quite
possible
after
what
you
have
told
me
that
they
may
bring
up
evidence
which
you
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
refute
i
do
think
it
will
be
so
if
i
did
i
should
use
all
my
influence
to
remove
my
sister
at
once
could
do
it
said
caldigate
very
angrily
tell
you
what
i
should
endeavour
to
do
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
stand
aloof
just
at
present
i
do
suppose
you
can
defend
such
a
condition
of
things
as
you
described
to
me
the
other
day
do
not
mean
to
be
put
upon
my
defence
at
any
rate
by
you
said
caldigate
very
angrily
and
then
he
left
the
office
he
had
come
into
cambridge
with
the
intention
of
calling
at
puritan
grange
after
he
had
left
the
attorney
and
when
he
found
himself
in
the
street
he
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
chesterton
he
had
wished
to
thank
his
wife
mother
for
her
concession
and
had
been
told
by
hester
that
if
he
would
call
bolton
would
certainly
see
him
now
had
there
been
no
letter
from
the
woman
in
australia
he
would
probably
not
have
obeyed
his
wife
behest
in
this
matter
his
heart
and
spirit
would
then
have
been
without
a
flaw
and
proud
in
his
own
strength
and
his
own
rectitude
he
would
have
declared
to
himself
that
the
absurd
prejudices
of
a
fanatic
woman
were
beneath
his
notice
but
that
letter
had
been
a
blow
and
the
blow
though
it
had
not
quelled
him
had
weakened
his
forces
he
could
conceal
the
injury
done
him
even
from
his
wife
but
there
was
an
injury
he
was
not
quite
the
man
that
he
had
been
before
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
he
was
always
remonstrating
with
himself
because
it
was
so
he
was
conscious
that
in
some
degree
he
had
been
cowed
and
was
ever
fighting
against
the
feeling
his
tenderness
to
his
wife
was
perhaps
increased
because
he
knew
that
she
still
suffered
from
the
letter
but
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
his
own
tenderness
as
being
a
sign
of
weakness
he
made
himself
very
busy
in
these
days
busy
among
his
brother
magistrates
busy
among
his
farming
operations
busy
with
his
tenants
busy
among
his
books
so
as
to
show
to
those
around
him
that
he
was
one
who
could
perform
all
the
duties
of
life
and
enjoy
all
the
pleasures
with
an
open
brow
and
a
clear
conscience
he
had
been
ever
bold
and
but
now
he
was
perhaps
a
little
but
through
it
all
the
australian
letter
and
the
australian
woman
were
present
to
him
day
and
night
it
was
this
resolution
not
to
be
quelled
that
had
made
him
call
upon
the
attorney
at
his
office
and
when
he
found
himself
back
in
the
street
he
was
very
angry
with
the
man
it
pleases
him
let
it
be
so
he
said
to
himself
can
do
in
the
world
without
him
and
then
he
thought
of
that
threat
when
the
attorney
had
said
that
he
would
remove
his
sister
her
by
heavens
he
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
as
he
went
he
struck
it
angrily
against
a
post
remove
his
wife
all
the
boltons
in
cambridgeshire
could
not
put
a
hand
upon
her
unless
by
his
leave
for
some
moments
his
anger
supported
him
but
after
a
while
that
gave
way
to
the
old
feeling
of
discomfort
which
pervaded
him
always
she
was
his
wife
and
nobody
should
touch
her
nevertheless
he
might
find
it
difficult
as
robert
bolton
had
said
to
prove
that
that
other
woman
was
not
his
wife
robert
bolton
office
was
in
a
small
street
close
to
pembroke
college
and
when
he
came
out
of
it
he
had
intended
to
walk
direct
through
trumpington
street
and
trinity
street
to
chesterton
but
he
found
it
necessary
to
compose
himself
and
so
to
arrange
his
thoughts
that
he
might
be
able
to
answer
such
foolish
questions
as
bolton
would
probably
ask
him
without
being
flurried
he
was
almost
sure
that
she
had
heard
nothing
of
the
woman
he
did
not
suspect
robert
bolton
of
treachery
in
that
respect
but
she
would
probably
talk
to
him
about
the
iniquity
of
his
past
life
generally
and
he
must
be
prepared
to
answer
her
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
shake
off
before
he
reached
chesterton
that
mixture
of
alarm
and
anger
which
at
present
dominated
him
and
with
this
object
instead
of
going
straight
along
the
street
he
turned
into
the
quadrangle
of
king
college
and
passing
through
the
gardens
and
over
the
bridge
wandered
for
a
while
slowly
under
the
trees
at
the
back
of
the
college
he
accused
himself
of
a
lack
of
manliness
in
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
thus
cowed
did
he
not
know
that
such
threats
as
these
were
common
was
it
not
just
what
might
have
been
expected
from
such
a
one
as
crinkett
when
crinkett
was
driven
to
desperation
by
failing
speculations
as
he
thought
of
the
woman
he
shook
his
head
looking
down
upon
the
ground
the
woman
had
at
one
time
been
very
dear
to
him
but
it
was
clearly
now
his
duty
to
go
on
as
though
there
were
no
such
woman
as
euphemia
smith
and
no
such
man
as
thomas
crinkett
and
as
for
robert
bolton
he
would
henceforth
treat
him
as
though
his
anger
and
his
suspicions
were
unworthy
of
notice
if
the
man
should
choose
of
his
own
accord
to
reassume
the
old
friendly
relations
well
and
good
no
overtures
should
come
from
him
caldigate
and
if
the
anger
and
the
suspicions
endured
why
then
he
caldigate
could
do
very
well
without
robert
bolton
as
he
made
these
resolutions
he
turned
in
at
a
little
gate
opening
into
a
corner
of
john
gardens
with
the
object
of
passing
through
the
college
back
into
the
streets
of
the
town
it
was
not
quite
his
nearest
way
but
he
loved
the
old
buildings
and
the
trees
and
the
river
even
in
winter
it
still
was
winter
being
now
the
middle
of
february
but
as
it
happened
the
air
was
dry
and
mild
and
the
sun
was
shining
still
he
was
surprised
at
such
a
time
of
the
year
to
see
an
elderly
man
apparently
asleep
on
one
of
the
benches
which
are
placed
close
to
the
path
but
there
he
was
asleep
with
his
two
hands
on
a
stick
and
his
head
bent
forward
over
his
stick
it
was
impossible
not
to
look
at
the
man
sleeping
there
in
that
way
but
caldigate
would
hardly
have
looked
would
hardly
have
dared
to
look
could
he
have
anticipated
what
he
would
see
the
elderly
man
was
thomas
crinkett
as
he
passed
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
man
was
thomas
crinkett
when
he
had
gone
on
a
dozen
yards
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
consider
what
he
would
do
a
dozen
different
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
in
that
moment
of
time
why
was
the
man
there
why
indeed
could
he
have
come
to
england
except
with
the
view
of
prosecuting
the
demand
which
he
and
the
woman
had
made
his
presence
even
in
england
was
sufficient
to
declare
that
this
battle
would
have
to
be
fought
but
to
cambridge
he
could
have
come
with
no
other
object
than
that
of
beginning
the
attack
at
once
and
then
had
he
already
commenced
his
work
he
had
not
at
any
rate
been
to
robert
bolton
to
whom
any
one
knowing
the
family
would
have
first
referred
him
and
why
was
he
sleeping
there
why
was
he
not
now
at
work
upon
his
project
again
would
it
be
better
at
the
present
moment
that
he
should
pass
by
the
man
as
though
he
had
not
seen
him
or
should
he
go
back
and
ask
him
his
purpose
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
he
stayed
his
step
for
a
moment
on
the
pathway
and
looked
round
the
man
had
moved
his
position
and
was
now
sitting
with
his
head
turned
away
but
evidently
not
asleep
then
it
occurred
to
caldigate
that
crinkett
slumbers
had
been
only
a
pretence
that
the
man
had
seen
and
recognised
him
and
at
the
moment
had
not
chosen
to
make
himself
known
and
it
occurred
to
him
also
that
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
as
this
he
should
do
nothing
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
nothing
without
consideration
a
word
spoken
to
crinkett
a
word
without
consideration
might
be
fatal
to
him
so
he
passed
on
having
stood
upon
the
path
hardly
more
than
a
second
or
two
before
he
had
got
up
to
the
new
buildings
of
john
a
cold
sweat
had
come
out
all
over
him
he
was
conscious
of
this
and
conscious
also
that
for
a
time
he
was
so
confounded
by
the
apparition
of
his
enemy
as
to
be
unable
to
bring
his
mind
to
work
properly
on
the
subject
him
do
his
worst
he
kept
on
saying
to
himself
him
do
his
worst
but
he
knew
that
the
brave
words
though
spoken
only
to
himself
were
mere
braggadocio
no
doubt
the
man
would
do
his
worst
and
very
bad
it
would
be
to
him
at
the
moment
he
was
so
cowed
by
fear
that
he
would
have
given
half
his
fortune
to
have
secured
the
woman
silence
and
the
man
how
much
better
would
it
have
been
had
he
acceded
to
the
first
demand
as
to
restitution
of
a
portion
of
the
sum
paid
for
polyeuka
before
the
woman
name
had
been
brought
into
the
matter
at
all
but
reflections
such
as
these
were
now
useless
and
he
must
do
something
it
was
for
his
wife
sake
he
assured
himself
for
his
wife
sake
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
made
thus
miserable
by
the
presence
of
this
wretched
creature
what
would
she
not
be
called
upon
to
suffer
the
woman
no
doubt
would
be
brought
before
magistrates
and
judges
and
would
be
made
to
swear
that
she
was
his
wife
the
whole
story
of
his
life
in
australia
would
be
made
public
and
there
was
so
much
that
could
not
be
made
public
without
overwhelming
her
with
sorrow
his
own
father
too
who
had
surrendered
the
estate
to
him
must
know
it
all
his
father
hitherto
had
not
heard
the
name
of
smith
and
had
been
told
only
of
crinkett
dishonest
successes
and
dishonest
failures
when
caldigate
had
spoken
of
crinkett
to
his
father
he
had
done
so
with
a
triumph
as
of
a
man
whom
he
had
weighed
and
measured
and
made
use
of
whose
frauds
and
cunning
he
had
conquered
by
his
own
honesty
and
better
knowledge
now
he
could
no
longer
weigh
and
measure
and
make
use
of
crinkett
crinkett
had
been
a
joke
to
him
in
talking
with
his
father
but
crinkett
was
no
joke
now
while
walking
through
the
college
quad
he
was
half
stupefied
by
his
confusion
and
was
aware
that
such
was
his
condition
but
going
out
under
the
gate
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
shook
himself
he
must
at
any
rate
summon
his
own
powers
to
his
aid
at
the
moment
and
resolve
what
he
would
do
however
bad
all
this
might
be
there
was
a
better
course
and
a
worse
if
he
allowed
this
confusion
to
master
him
he
would
probably
be
betrayed
into
the
worse
course
now
at
this
moment
in
what
way
would
it
become
him
to
act
he
drew
himself
together
shaking
his
head
and
shoulders
so
as
to
shake
off
his
weakness
pressing
his
foot
for
a
moment
on
the
earth
so
as
to
convince
himself
of
his
own
firmness
and
then
he
resolved
he
was
on
the
way
out
to
see
his
but
he
thought
that
nothing
now
could
be
gained
by
going
to
chesterton
it
was
not
impossible
that
crinkett
might
have
been
there
if
so
the
man
would
have
told
something
of
his
story
and
his
wife
mother
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
whom
under
such
circumstances
he
could
hope
to
satisfy
he
must
tell
no
lie
to
any
one
he
must
at
least
conceal
nothing
of
the
things
as
they
occurred
now
he
must
not
allow
it
to
be
first
told
by
crinkett
that
they
two
had
seen
each
other
in
the
gardens
but
he
could
not
declare
this
to
bolton
for
the
present
the
less
he
saw
of
bolton
the
better
she
would
come
to
the
christening
unless
indeed
crinkett
had
already
told
enough
to
induce
her
to
change
her
mind
but
after
that
any
intimacy
with
the
house
at
chesterton
had
better
be
postponed
till
this
had
all
been
settled
but
how
much
would
have
to
be
endured
before
that
robert
bolton
had
almost
threatened
to
take
his
wife
away
from
him
no
one
could
take
his
wife
away
from
him
unless
indeed
the
law
were
to
say
that
she
was
not
his
wife
but
how
would
it
be
with
him
if
she
herself
under
the
influence
of
her
family
were
to
wish
to
leave
him
the
law
no
doubt
would
give
him
the
custody
of
his
own
wife
till
the
law
had
said
that
she
was
not
his
wife
but
could
he
keep
her
if
she
asked
him
to
let
her
go
and
should
she
be
made
to
doubt
should
her
mind
be
so
troubled
as
it
would
be
should
she
once
be
taught
to
think
it
possible
that
she
had
been
betrayed
would
she
not
then
want
to
go
from
him
would
it
not
be
probable
that
she
would
doubt
when
she
should
be
told
that
this
woman
had
been
called
by
her
husband
name
in
australia
and
when
he
should
be
unable
to
deny
that
he
had
admitted
or
at
least
had
not
contradicted
the
appellation
on
a
sudden
when
he
turned
away
from
the
street
leading
to
chesterton
as
he
came
out
of
the
college
he
resolved
that
he
would
at
once
go
back
to
robert
bolton
the
man
was
offensive
suspicious
and
but
nevertheless
his
good
services
if
they
could
be
secured
would
be
for
his
wife
sake
as
caldigate
said
to
himself
for
his
wife
sake
he
must
bear
much
have
come
to
tell
you
something
that
has
occurred
since
i
was
here
just
now
said
caldigate
meeting
his
at
the
door
of
the
office
you
mind
coming
back
am
rather
in
a
hurry
is
of
importance
and
you
had
better
hear
it
said
caldigate
leading
the
way
imperiously
to
the
inner
room
is
for
your
sake
that
man
crinkett
is
in
cambridge
cambridge
saw
him
just
now
spoke
to
him
the
attorney
asked
i
passed
him
and
i
do
not
know
even
whether
he
recognised
me
but
he
is
here
in
cambridge
the
woman
have
told
you
all
that
i
know
he
has
not
come
here
for
nothing
not
said
the
attorney
with
a
scornful
smile
will
hear
of
him
before
long
course
i
shall
i
have
come
to
you
now
to
ask
a
question
i
must
put
my
case
at
once
into
a
lawyer
hands
crinkett
no
doubt
will
commit
perjury
and
i
must
undergo
the
annoyance
and
expense
of
proving
him
to
be
a
perjurer
she
probably
is
here
also
and
will
be
ready
to
commit
perjury
of
course
i
must
have
a
lawyer
will
you
act
for
me
will
act
for
my
sister
sister
and
i
are
one
and
i
am
obliged
therefore
to
ask
again
whether
you
will
act
for
me
of
course
i
should
prefer
it
though
you
are
i
think
hard
to
me
in
this
matter
i
can
trust
you
implicitly
it
will
be
infinitely
better
for
hester
that
it
should
be
so
but
i
must
have
some
lawyer
so
must
she
and
mine
must
be
the
same
as
to
that
i
will
not
admit
any
question
can
you
undertake
to
fight
this
matter
on
my
behalf
and
on
hers
if
you
feel
absolutely
hostile
to
me
you
had
better
decline
for
myself
i
can
not
understand
why
there
should
be
such
hostility
caldigate
had
so
far
conquered
his
own
feelings
of
abasement
as
to
be
able
to
say
this
with
a
determined
face
looking
straight
into
the
attorney
eyes
at
any
rate
without
sign
of
fear
wants
thinking
about
said
robert
bolton
the
baby
is
to
be
christened
and
for
hester
sake
i
will
endeavour
to
put
this
matter
aside
but
on
wednesday
i
must
know
wednesday
morning
i
will
answer
your
question
but
what
if
this
man
comes
to
me
in
the
meantime
to
him
or
speak
to
him
just
as
seems
good
to
you
you
know
everything
that
there
is
to
tell
and
may
therefore
know
whether
he
lies
or
speaks
the
truth
then
caldigate
went
to
the
inn
got
his
horse
and
rode
back
to
folking
chapter
xxvii
the
christening
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
the
christening
caldigate
on
his
return
home
from
cambridge
had
felt
himself
doomed
to
silence
he
could
not
now
at
this
moment
tell
his
wife
that
the
man
had
come
the
man
who
would
doubtless
work
her
such
terrible
misery
she
was
very
strong
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
little
event
of
her
baby
birth
quite
as
well
as
could
be
expected
and
had
been
just
what
all
her
friends
might
have
wished
her
to
be
but
that
this
blow
had
fallen
upon
her
but
that
these
ill
news
had
wounded
her
she
would
now
have
been
triumphant
her
mother
was
at
last
coming
to
her
her
husband
was
all
that
a
husband
should
be
her
baby
was
to
her
thinking
sweeter
brighter
more
satisfactory
than
any
other
baby
ever
had
been
but
the
first
tidings
had
been
told
to
her
she
had
seen
the
letter
signed
caldigate
and
of
course
she
was
ill
at
ease
knowing
how
vexatious
the
matter
was
to
her
husband
she
had
spoken
of
it
but
seldom
having
asked
but
a
question
now
and
again
when
the
matter
pressed
itself
too
severely
on
her
mind
he
understood
it
all
both
her
reticence
and
her
sufferings
her
sufferings
must
of
course
be
increased
she
must
know
before
long
that
crinkett
and
probably
the
woman
also
were
in
her
neighbourhood
but
he
could
not
tell
her
now
when
she
was
preparing
her
baby
for
his
ceremony
in
the
church
the
bells
were
rung
and
the
baby
was
prepared
and
bolton
came
out
to
folking
according
to
her
promise
though
robert
was
not
there
many
of
the
boltons
were
present
as
was
also
uncle
babington
he
had
come
over
on
the
preceding
evening
making
on
this
occasion
his
first
journey
to
folking
since
his
wife
sister
had
died
and
the
old
squire
was
there
in
very
good
humour
though
he
excused
himself
from
going
to
the
church
by
explaining
that
as
he
had
no
duty
to
perform
he
would
only
be
in
the
way
amongst
them
all
daniel
and
bolton
had
also
been
at
folking
that
night
and
had
then
for
the
first
time
been
brought
into
contact
with
the
babington
grandeur
the
party
had
been
almost
gay
the
old
squire
having
taken
some
delight
in
what
he
thought
to
be
the
absurdities
of
his
babington
himself
was
a
man
who
was
joyous
on
most
occasions
and
always
gay
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
he
had
praised
the
mother
and
praised
the
baby
and
praised
the
house
of
folking
generally
graciously
declaring
that
his
wife
looked
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
making
acquaintance
with
her
new
niece
till
old
caldigate
had
been
delighted
with
these
manifestations
of
condescension
is
a
poor
place
said
he
babington
is
really
a
replied
the
other
squire
much
gratified
is
what
you
may
call
really
a
good
you
had
to
laugh
very
hard
at
him
before
you
could
offend
uncle
babington
in
all
this
john
caldigate
was
obliged
to
assist
knowing
all
the
time
feeling
all
the
time
that
crinkett
was
in
cambridge
and
through
all
this
the
young
mother
had
to
appear
happy
knowing
the
existence
of
that
letter
signed
caldigate
feeling
it
at
every
moment
and
they
both
acted
their
parts
well
caldigate
himself
though
when
he
was
alone
the
thought
of
what
was
coming
would
almost
crush
him
could
always
bear
himself
bravely
when
others
were
present
on
the
morning
before
they
went
to
church
when
the
bells
were
ringing
old
bolton
came
in
a
carriage
with
his
wife
from
cambridge
she
of
course
condescended
to
give
her
hand
to
her
but
she
did
it
with
a
look
which
was
full
of
bitterness
she
did
not
probably
intend
to
be
specially
bitter
but
bitterness
of
expression
was
common
to
her
she
was
taken
however
at
once
up
to
the
baby
and
then
in
the
presence
of
her
daughter
and
grandchild
it
may
be
presumed
that
she
relaxed
a
little
at
any
rate
her
presence
in
the
house
made
her
daughter
happy
for
the
time
then
they
all
went
to
the
church
except
the
squire
who
as
he
himself
pleaded
had
no
duty
to
perform
there
bolton
as
she
was
taken
through
the
hall
saw
him
and
recognised
him
but
would
not
condescend
even
to
bow
her
head
to
him
though
she
knew
how
intimate
he
had
been
with
her
husband
she
still
felt
though
she
had
yielded
for
this
day
this
day
which
was
to
make
her
grandchild
a
christian
that
there
must
be
and
should
be
a
severance
between
people
such
as
the
boltons
and
people
such
as
the
caldigates
as
the
service
went
on
and
as
the
water
was
sprinkled
and
as
the
prayers
were
said
caldigate
felt
thankful
that
so
much
had
been
allowed
to
be
done
before
the
great
trouble
had
disclosed
itself
the
doubt
whether
even
the
ceremony
could
be
performed
before
the
clap
of
thunder
had
been
heard
through
all
cambridge
had
been
in
itself
a
distinct
sorrow
to
him
had
crinkett
showed
himself
at
chesterton
neither
bolton
nor
daniel
bolton
would
have
been
standing
then
at
the
font
had
crinkett
been
heard
of
at
babington
uncle
babington
would
not
now
have
been
at
folking
all
this
was
passing
through
his
mind
as
he
was
standing
by
the
font
when
the
ceremony
of
making
the
young
daniel
humphrey
caldigate
a
christian
was
all
but
completed
he
fancied
that
he
saw
old
bolton
eyes
fixed
on
something
in
the
church
and
he
turned
his
head
suddenly
with
no
special
purpose
but
simply
looking
as
one
is
apt
to
look
when
another
looks
there
he
saw
on
a
seat
divided
from
himself
by
the
breadth
of
the
little
nave
thomas
crinkett
sitting
with
another
man
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
on
his
mind
as
to
the
identity
of
the
australian
nor
as
to
that
of
crinkett
companion
at
the
moment
he
did
not
remember
the
man
name
but
he
knew
him
as
a
miner
with
whom
he
had
been
familiar
at
ahalala
and
who
had
been
in
partnership
both
with
himself
and
crinkett
at
nobble
as
one
who
had
alas
been
in
his
society
when
euphemia
smith
had
been
there
also
at
that
instant
he
remembered
the
fact
that
the
man
had
called
euphemia
smith
caldigate
in
his
presence
and
that
he
had
let
the
name
pass
without
remonstrance
the
memory
of
that
moment
flashed
across
him
now
as
he
quickly
turned
back
his
face
towards
his
child
who
was
still
uttering
his
little
wail
in
the
arms
of
the
clergyman
utterden
church
is
not
a
large
building
the
seat
on
which
crinkett
had
placed
himself
was
one
usually
occupied
by
parish
boys
at
the
end
of
the
row
of
appropriated
seats
and
near
to
the
door
less
than
yards
from
it
at
the
other
side
of
the
way
leading
up
the
church
stood
the
font
so
that
the
stranger
was
almost
close
to
caldigate
when
he
turned
they
were
so
near
that
others
there
could
not
but
have
observed
them
even
the
clergyman
however
absorbed
he
might
have
been
in
his
sacred
work
could
not
but
have
observed
them
it
was
not
there
as
it
might
have
been
in
a
town
any
stranger
even
on
a
sunday
would
be
observed
by
all
in
utterden
church
how
much
then
at
a
ceremony
which
as
a
rule
none
but
friends
attend
and
crinkett
was
looking
on
with
all
his
eyes
leaning
forward
over
his
stick
and
watching
closely
caldigate
had
taken
it
all
in
even
in
that
moment
the
other
man
was
sitting
back
gazing
at
nothing
as
though
the
matter
to
him
were
indifferent
caldigate
could
understand
it
all
the
man
was
there
simply
to
act
or
to
speak
when
he
might
be
wanted
as
the
ceremony
was
completed
john
caldigate
stood
by
and
played
with
all
proper
words
and
actions
the
part
of
the
young
father
no
one
standing
there
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
had
been
struck
violently
that
he
had
for
a
few
moments
been
almost
unable
to
stand
but
he
himself
was
aware
that
a
cold
sweat
had
broken
out
all
over
him
as
before
though
he
leaned
over
the
baby
lying
in
his
mother
arms
and
kissed
it
and
smiled
on
the
young
mother
he
did
so
as
some
great
actor
will
carry
out
his
part
before
the
public
when
nearly
sinking
to
the
ground
from
sudden
suffering
what
would
it
be
right
that
he
should
do
now
now
now
no
one
there
had
heard
of
crinkett
except
his
wife
and
even
she
herself
had
no
idea
that
the
man
of
whom
she
had
heard
was
in
england
should
he
speak
to
the
man
or
should
he
endeavour
to
pass
out
of
the
church
as
though
he
had
not
recognised
him
could
he
trust
himself
even
to
make
the
endeavour
when
he
should
have
turned
round
and
when
he
would
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
man
and
then
what
should
he
say
and
how
should
he
act
if
the
man
addressed
him
in
the
church
the
man
had
not
come
out
there
to
utterden
for
nothing
and
probably
would
so
address
him
he
had
determined
on
telling
no
lie
no
lie
at
any
rate
as
to
present
circumstances
that
life
of
his
in
australia
had
been
necessarily
rough
and
though
successful
had
not
been
quite
as
it
should
have
been
as
to
that
he
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
permitted
to
him
to
be
reticent
but
as
to
nothing
since
his
marriage
would
he
lie
if
crinkett
spoke
to
him
he
must
acknowledge
the
man
but
if
crinkett
told
his
story
about
euphemia
smith
in
the
church
before
them
all
how
should
he
then
answer
there
was
but
a
moment
for
him
to
decide
it
all
the
decision
had
to
be
made
while
he
was
handing
back
his
babe
to
its
mother
with
his
sweetest
smile
as
the
party
at
the
font
was
broken
up
the
eyes
of
them
all
were
fixed
upon
the
two
strangers
a
christening
in
a
public
church
is
a
public
service
and
open
to
the
world
at
large
there
was
no
question
to
be
asked
them
but
each
person
as
he
looked
at
them
would
of
course
think
that
somebody
else
would
recognise
them
they
were
decently
dressed
dressed
probably
in
such
garments
as
gentlemen
generally
wear
on
winter
mornings
but
any
one
would
know
at
a
glance
that
they
were
not
english
gentlemen
and
they
were
of
an
appearance
unfamiliar
to
any
one
there
but
caldigate
himself
clean
but
rough
not
quite
at
home
in
their
clothes
which
had
probably
been
bought
with
rough
ignoble
faces
faces
which
you
would
suspect
but
faces
nevertheless
which
had
in
them
something
of
courage
as
the
little
crowd
prepared
to
move
from
the
font
the
two
men
got
up
and
stood
in
their
places
caldigate
took
the
opportunity
to
say
a
word
to
bromley
before
he
turned
round
so
that
he
might
yet
pause
before
he
decided
at
that
moment
he
resolved
that
he
would
recognise
his
enemy
and
treat
him
with
the
courtesy
of
old
friendship
it
would
be
bad
to
do
at
the
moment
but
he
thought
that
in
this
way
he
might
best
prepare
himself
for
the
future
crinkett
had
appealed
to
him
for
money
but
crinkett
himself
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
euphemia
smith
the
man
had
not
as
yet
accused
him
of
bigamy
the
accusation
had
come
from
her
and
it
still
might
be
that
she
had
used
crinkett
name
wrongfully
at
any
rate
he
thought
that
when
the
clap
of
thunder
should
have
come
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
have
repudiated
a
man
with
whom
it
would
then
be
known
that
his
relations
had
once
been
so
intimate
he
addressed
himself
therefore
at
once
to
his
old
associate
am
surprised
to
see
you
here
mr
crinkett
this
he
said
with
a
smile
and
a
pleasant
voice
putting
out
his
hand
to
him
how
hard
it
was
to
summon
up
that
smile
how
hard
to
get
that
tone
of
voice
even
those
commonplace
words
had
been
so
difficult
of
selection
it
you
i
saw
yesterday
in
the
college
gardens
it
was
me
no
doubt
turned
round
and
then
thought
that
it
was
impossible
we
have
just
been
christening
my
child
will
you
come
up
to
our
breakfast
remember
jack
adamson
eh
course
i
do
said
caldigate
giving
his
hand
to
the
second
man
who
was
rougher
even
than
crinkett
hope
he
will
come
up
also
this
is
my
uncle
babington
and
this
is
my
mr
bolton
were
two
of
my
partners
at
nobble
he
said
turning
to
the
two
old
gentlemen
who
were
looking
on
with
astonished
eyes
have
come
over
here
i
suppose
with
reference
to
the
sale
i
made
to
them
lately
of
my
interests
at
polyeuka
about
it
said
adamson
wo
talk
business
just
at
this
moment
because
we
have
to
eat
our
breakfast
and
drink
our
boy
health
but
when
that
is
done
i
hear
what
you
have
to
say
or
come
into
cambridge
just
as
you
please
you
walk
up
to
the
house
now
and
i
introduce
you
to
my
wife
do
mind
if
we
do
eat
a
bit
do
we
jack
said
crinkett
jack
bobbed
his
head
and
so
they
walked
back
to
folking
the
three
of
them
together
while
the
two
boltons
and
uncle
babington
followed
behind
the
ladies
and
the
baby
had
been
taken
in
a
carriage
the
distance
from
the
church
to
the
house
at
folking
was
less
than
half
a
mile
but
caldigate
thought
that
he
would
never
reach
his
hall
door
how
was
he
to
talk
to
the
men
with
what
words
and
after
what
fashion
and
what
should
he
say
about
them
to
his
wife
when
he
reached
home
she
had
seen
him
speak
to
them
had
known
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
stay
behind
with
them
when
it
would
have
been
so
natural
that
he
should
have
been
at
her
side
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
of
that
he
was
aware
but
he
could
not
know
how
far
their
presence
would
have
frightened
her
he
said
in
answer
to
some
question
from
crinkett
property
round
here
is
not
exactly
mine
but
my
father
tell
me
as
it
yours
now
said
crinkett
have
to
learn
that
in
regard
to
other
people
concerns
men
talk
more
than
they
know
the
land
is
my
father
estate
but
i
live
here
him
asked
adamson
lives
in
cambridge
what
we
mean
ai
it
crinkett
said
adamson
boss
here
i
boss
a
deuced
good
time
you
seem
to
have
of
it
said
crinkett
nothing
to
complain
of
replied
caldigate
feeling
himself
at
the
moment
to
be
the
most
miserable
creature
in
existence
it
was
fearful
work
work
so
cruel
that
his
physical
strength
hardly
enabled
him
to
support
it
he
already
repented
his
present
conduct
telling
himself
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
treated
the
men
from
the
first
as
spies
and
enemies
though
in
truth
his
conduct
had
probably
been
the
wisest
he
could
have
adopted
at
last
he
had
the
men
inside
the
hall
door
and
introducing
them
hurriedly
to
his
father
he
left
them
that
he
might
rush
up
to
his
wife
bedroom
the
nurse
was
there
and
her
mother
and
at
the
moment
she
only
looked
at
him
she
was
too
wise
to
speak
to
him
before
them
but
at
last
she
succeeded
in
making
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
her
husband
stay
here
nurse
i
be
back
directly
mamma
and
then
she
took
him
across
the
passage
into
his
own
are
they
john
who
are
they
are
men
from
the
mines
as
they
were
my
partners
i
have
asked
them
to
come
in
to
breakfast
the
woman
as
she
spoke
she
held
on
to
the
back
of
a
chair
by
which
she
stood
and
only
whispered
her
question
woman
is
with
them
it
the
man
crinkett
it
is
crinkett
this
house
and
i
am
to
sit
at
table
with
him
will
be
best
so
listen
dearest
all
that
i
know
all
that
we
know
of
crinkett
is
that
he
is
asking
money
of
me
because
the
purchase
he
made
of
me
has
turned
out
badly
for
him
he
is
to
marry
that
woman
who
says
that
she
is
then
she
stopped
looking
into
his
face
with
agony
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
utter
the
words
which
would
signify
that
another
woman
claimed
to
be
her
husband
wife
are
going
too
fast
hester
i
can
not
condemn
the
man
for
what
the
woman
has
written
until
i
know
that
he
says
the
same
himself
he
was
my
partner
and
i
have
had
his
money
i
fear
all
his
money
he
as
yet
has
said
nothing
about
the
woman
as
it
is
so
it
behoves
me
to
be
courteous
to
him
that
i
am
suffering
much
you
must
be
well
aware
i
am
sure
you
will
not
make
it
worse
for
me
no
she
said
embracing
him
will
not
i
will
be
brave
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
but
you
will
tell
me
everything
he
said
then
he
kissed
her
and
went
back
again
to
his
unwelcome
guests
she
was
not
long
before
she
followed
him
bringing
her
baby
in
her
arms
then
she
took
the
child
round
to
be
kissed
by
all
its
relatives
and
afterwards
bowed
politely
to
the
two
men
and
told
them
that
she
was
glad
to
see
her
husband
old
friends
and
mum
said
jack
adamson
been
when
the
work
was
hard
enough
t
young
squire
seems
to
have
got
over
his
difficulties
pretty
tidy
then
she
smiled
again
and
nodded
to
them
and
retreated
back
to
her
mother
bolton
scowled
at
them
feeling
certain
that
they
were
godless
persons
in
which
she
was
right
the
old
banker
drawing
his
son
daniel
out
of
the
room
whispered
an
inquiry
but
daniel
bolton
knew
nothing
been
something
wrong
as
to
the
sale
of
that
mine
said
the
banker
daniel
bolton
thought
it
probable
that
there
had
been
something
wrong
the
breakfast
was
eaten
and
the
child
health
was
drunk
and
the
hour
was
passed
it
was
a
bad
time
for
them
all
but
for
caldigate
it
was
a
very
bitter
hour
to
him
the
effort
made
was
even
more
difficult
than
to
her
as
was
right
for
she
at
any
rate
had
been
blameless
then
the
boltons
went
away
as
had
been
arranged
and
also
uncle
babington
while
the
men
still
remained
you
do
mind
squire
i
take
a
turn
with
you
said
crinkett
at
last
jack
can
sit
anywhere
about
the
place
said
caldigate
and
so
they
took
their
hats
and
went
off
and
jack
adamson
was
left
anywhere
about
the
place
chapter
xxviii
tom
crinkett
at
folking
caldigate
thought
that
he
had
better
take
his
companion
where
there
would
be
the
least
chance
of
encountering
many
eyes
he
went
therefore
through
the
garden
into
the
farmyard
and
along
the
road
leading
back
to
the
dike
and
then
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
ferry
over
the
wash
and
the
termination
of
the
private
way
by
which
they
had
come
the
spot
was
not
attractive
as
far
as
rural
prettiness
was
concerned
they
had
on
one
hand
or
the
other
as
they
turned
the
long
straight
deep
dike
which
had
been
cut
at
right
angles
to
the
middle
wash
and
around
the
fields
were
flat
plashy
and
with
the
mud
of
february
but
crinkett
for
a
while
did
not
cease
to
admire
everything
them
are
all
yourn
he
said
pointing
to
a
crowd
of
standing
in
the
haggard
they
mine
i
wish
they
were
not
do
you
mean
by
that
prices
are
at
present
a
man
does
make
pinch
by
growing
corn
and
keeping
it
to
this
time
of
the
year
where
them
chimneys
is
is
that
yourn
this
he
said
pointing
along
the
straight
line
of
the
road
to
farmer
holt
homestead
which
showed
itself
on
the
other
side
of
the
belongs
to
the
estate
said
caldigate
jingo
and
how
i
remember
your
and
talking
to
me
across
the
gate
at
polyeuka
hall
remember
it
very
well
did
know
as
you
were
an
estated
gent
in
those
days
had
spent
a
lot
of
money
when
i
was
young
and
the
estate
as
you
call
it
was
not
large
enough
to
bear
the
loss
so
i
had
to
go
out
and
work
and
get
back
what
i
had
squandered
you
did
it
i
did
it
word
yes
what
a
lot
of
money
you
took
out
of
the
colony
caldigate
not
going
to
praise
myself
but
i
worked
hard
for
it
and
when
i
got
it
i
did
run
riot
with
drink
in
any
other
way
i
kept
my
money
i
do
know
as
you
was
very
much
more
of
a
joseph
than
anybody
else
then
crinkett
laughed
most
disagreeably
and
caldigate
turning
over
various
ideas
rapidly
in
his
mind
thought
that
a
good
deed
would
be
done
if
a
man
so
void
of
feeling
could
be
drowned
beneath
the
waters
of
the
black
deep
dike
which
was
slowly
creeping
along
by
their
side
way
you
was
lucky
infernally
lucky
did
not
do
badly
yourself
when
i
first
reached
nobble
you
had
the
name
of
more
money
than
i
ever
made
got
it
now
eh
caldigate
who
got
my
money
now
would
take
a
clever
man
to
tell
that
do
take
much
cleverness
for
me
to
tell
who
has
got
more
of
it
nor
anybody
else
and
it
do
take
much
cleverness
for
me
to
tell
that
i
ai
got
none
of
it
left
myself
none
of
it
caldigate
not
a
d
hundred
pounds
this
he
said
with
terrible
energy
sorry
it
so
bad
as
that
with
you
crinkett
you
is
sorry
i
daresay
you
acted
sorry
in
all
you
said
and
done
since
i
got
taken
in
last
by
that
mine
have
you
well
i
have
got
just
a
few
hundreds
what
i
could
scrape
together
to
bring
me
and
a
few
others
as
might
be
wanted
over
to
england
there
jack
adamson
with
me
and
just
two
more
they
may
be
wanted
squire
the
attack
now
was
being
commenced
and
how
was
he
to
repel
it
or
to
answer
it
only
on
one
ground
had
he
received
from
robert
bolton
a
decided
opinion
under
no
circumstances
was
he
to
give
money
to
these
persons
were
he
to
be
guilty
of
that
weakness
he
would
have
delivered
himself
over
into
their
hands
and
not
only
did
he
put
implicit
trust
in
the
sagacity
of
robert
bolton
but
he
himself
knew
enough
of
the
opinion
on
such
a
matter
to
be
aware
that
a
man
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
frightened
out
of
money
is
supposed
to
have
acknowledged
some
terrible
delinquency
he
had
been
very
clear
in
his
mind
when
that
letter
came
from
euphemia
smith
that
he
would
not
now
make
any
rebate
till
that
attack
had
come
it
might
have
been
open
to
him
to
be
generous
but
not
now
and
yet
when
this
man
spoke
of
his
own
loss
and
reminded
him
of
his
wealth
when
crinkett
threw
it
in
his
teeth
that
by
a
happy
chance
he
had
feathered
his
nest
with
the
spoils
taken
from
the
wretched
man
himself
then
he
wished
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
give
back
something
that
said
as
a
threat
he
asked
looking
round
on
his
companion
and
resolving
that
he
would
be
brave
as
you
take
it
squire
we
do
want
to
threaten
nothing
if
you
do
you
better
go
and
do
what
you
have
to
do
away
from
here
you
be
so
rough
now
with
an
old
pal
you
wo
do
no
good
by
being
rough
i
was
rough
to
you
when
you
came
to
polyeuka
hall
without
very
much
in
your
pocket
this
was
untrue
for
crinkett
had
been
rough
and
caldigate
pockets
had
been
full
of
money
but
there
could
be
no
good
got
by
contradicting
him
on
small
trifles
was
a
good
mate
to
you
then
you
would
even
have
got
your
finger
into
the
old
nor
yet
into
polyeuka
but
for
me
i
was
the
making
of
your
fortin
caldigate
i
was
fortune
such
as
it
is
was
made
by
my
own
industry
be
blowed
i
do
know
that
you
were
so
much
better
than
anybody
else
was
i
industrious
was
i
thinking
of
it
morning
noon
and
night
and
nothing
else
you
was
smart
i
do
allow
that
caldigate
you
was
very
smart
you
ever
know
me
dishonest
what
honesty
there
nothing
so
smart
as
honesty
whatever
you
got
you
got
a
sure
hold
of
that
what
you
mean
by
honesty
you
was
clever
enough
to
take
care
as
you
had
really
got
it
now
about
this
polyeuka
business
i
tell
you
how
it
is
i
and
jack
adamson
and
another
as
he
alluded
to
the
he
winked
believed
in
polyeuka
we
did
d
the
cussed
hole
well
when
you
was
gone
we
thought
we
try
it
it
was
not
easy
to
get
the
money
as
you
wanted
but
we
got
it
one
of
the
banks
down
at
sydney
went
shares
but
took
all
the
plant
as
security
then
the
cussed
place
ran
out
the
moment
the
money
was
paid
it
was
just
as
though
fortin
had
done
it
a
purpose
if
you
do
believe
what
i
i
got
the
documents
to
show
you
caldigate
did
believe
what
the
man
said
it
was
a
matter
as
to
which
he
had
in
the
way
of
business
received
intelligence
of
his
own
from
the
colony
and
he
was
aware
that
he
had
been
singularly
lucky
as
to
the
circumstances
and
time
of
the
sale
but
there
had
been
nothing
about
it
those
in
the
colony
who
understood
the
matter
thought
at
the
time
that
he
was
making
a
sacrifice
of
his
own
interests
by
the
terms
proposed
he
had
thought
so
himself
but
had
been
willing
to
make
it
in
order
that
he
might
rid
himself
of
further
trouble
he
had
believed
that
the
machinery
and
plant
attached
to
the
mine
had
been
nearly
worth
the
money
and
he
had
been
quite
certain
that
crinkett
himself
when
making
the
bargain
had
considered
himself
to
be
in
luck
way
but
such
property
as
he
well
knew
was
by
its
nature
precarious
and
liable
to
sudden
changes
he
had
been
fortunate
and
the
purchasers
had
been
the
reverse
of
that
he
had
no
doubt
though
probably
the
man
had
exaggerated
his
own
misfortune
when
he
had
been
given
to
understand
how
bad
had
been
the
fate
of
these
old
companions
of
his
in
the
matter
with
the
feelings
of
a
liberal
gentleman
he
was
anxious
to
share
with
them
the
loss
had
crinkett
come
to
him
explaining
all
that
he
now
explained
without
any
interference
from
euphemia
smith
he
would
have
been
anxious
to
do
much
but
now
how
could
he
do
anything
now
do
not
at
all
disbelieve
what
you
tell
me
about
the
mine
he
said
yet
you
wo
do
anything
for
us
you
ai
above
taking
all
our
money
and
seeing
us
starve
and
that
when
you
have
got
everything
round
you
here
like
an
estated
gentleman
as
you
are
there
was
a
touch
of
eloquence
in
this
a
soundness
of
expostulation
which
moved
him
much
he
could
afford
to
give
back
half
the
price
he
had
received
for
the
mine
and
yet
be
a
man
he
paid
over
to
his
father
the
rents
from
folking
but
he
had
the
house
and
for
nothing
and
the
sum
which
he
had
received
for
polyeuka
by
no
means
represented
all
his
savings
he
did
not
like
to
think
that
he
had
denuded
this
man
who
had
been
his
partner
of
everything
in
order
that
he
himself
might
be
unnecessarily
rich
it
was
not
pleasant
to
him
to
think
that
the
fatness
of
his
opulence
had
been
extracted
from
jack
adamson
and
from
euphemia
smith
when
the
application
for
return
of
the
money
had
been
first
made
to
him
from
australia
he
had
known
what
he
knew
now
there
had
been
no
eloquence
then
no
expostulation
now
he
thoroughly
wished
that
he
was
able
to
make
restitution
threat
has
been
used
to
me
he
muttered
almost
anxious
to
explain
to
the
man
his
exact
position
threat
i
ai
threatened
nothing
but
i
tell
you
there
will
be
threats
and
worse
than
threats
fair
means
first
and
foul
means
afterwards
that
about
it
caldigate
if
he
could
have
got
this
man
to
say
that
there
was
no
threat
to
be
simply
piteous
he
thought
that
he
might
even
yet
have
suggested
some
compromise
but
that
was
impossible
when
he
was
told
that
worse
than
threats
was
in
store
for
him
he
was
silent
for
some
moments
thinking
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
him
to
rush
into
that
matter
of
euphemia
smith
himself
but
up
to
this
time
he
had
no
absolute
knowledge
that
crinkett
was
aware
of
the
letter
which
had
been
written
no
doubt
that
in
speaking
of
as
being
joined
with
himself
and
adamson
he
had
intended
that
euphemia
smith
should
be
understood
but
till
her
name
had
been
mentioned
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
mention
it
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
betray
the
fear
which
would
become
evident
if
he
spoke
of
the
woman
think
you
had
better
go
to
my
lawyer
he
said
do
want
no
lawyering
the
plunder
is
yours
no
doubt
whether
you
have
so
much
law
on
your
side
in
other
matters
that
the
question
crinkett
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
state
of
his
companion
mind
to
crinkett
it
appeared
that
caldigate
was
simply
anxious
to
save
his
money
do
not
know
that
i
can
say
anything
else
to
you
just
at
present
the
bargain
was
a
fair
bargain
and
you
have
no
ground
for
any
claim
you
come
to
me
with
some
mysterious
threat
understand
said
crinkett
care
nothing
for
your
threats
i
can
only
bid
you
go
and
do
your
worst
what
we
intend
you
should
have
lost
money
by
me
is
a
great
sorrow
to
me
look
sorry
squire
after
what
you
have
said
i
can
make
you
no
offer
if
you
will
go
to
my
robert
bolton
the
lady
brother
wife
brother
know
all
about
it
caldigate
i
wo
go
to
him
at
all
what
he
to
us
it
ai
likely
that
i
am
going
to
ask
him
for
money
to
hold
our
tongues
not
a
bit
of
it
you
had
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
that
mine
the
bank
found
twenty
and
took
all
the
plant
there
forty
gone
will
you
share
the
loss
give
us
twenty
and
we
be
off
back
to
australia
by
the
first
ship
and
i
take
a
wife
back
with
me
you
understand
i
take
a
wife
back
with
me
then
we
shall
be
all
square
all
round
with
what
delight
would
he
have
given
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
had
he
dared
had
there
been
no
question
about
the
woman
he
would
have
given
the
money
to
satisfy
his
own
conscience
as
to
the
injury
he
had
involuntarily
done
to
his
old
partners
but
he
could
not
do
it
now
he
could
make
no
suggestion
towards
doing
it
to
do
so
would
be
to
own
to
all
the
boltons
that
euphemia
smith
was
his
wife
and
were
he
to
do
so
how
could
he
make
himself
secure
that
the
man
and
the
woman
would
go
back
to
australia
and
trouble
him
no
more
all
experience
forbade
him
to
hope
for
such
a
result
and
then
the
payment
of
the
money
would
be
one
of
many
damning
pieces
of
evidence
against
him
they
had
now
got
back
for
the
second
time
to
the
spot
at
which
the
way
up
to
the
house
at
folking
turned
off
from
the
dike
here
he
paused
and
spoke
what
were
intended
to
be
his
last
words
have
nothing
more
to
say
crinkett
i
will
not
promise
anything
myself
a
threatened
man
should
never
give
way
you
know
that
yourself
but
if
you
will
go
to
my
i
will
get
him
to
see
you
your
he
ai
your
no
more
than
i
am
now
the
sword
had
been
drawn
and
the
battle
had
been
declared
that
said
caldigate
walking
on
in
front
shall
decline
to
speak
to
you
any
further
he
went
back
through
the
farmyard
at
a
quick
pace
while
crinkett
kept
up
with
him
but
still
a
few
steps
behind
in
the
front
of
the
house
they
found
jack
adamson
who
in
obedience
to
his
friend
suggestion
had
been
sitting
anywhere
about
the
place
blowed
if
he
do
mean
to
stick
to
every
lump
he
robbed
us
of
said
crinkett
in
a
loud
voice
do
do
he
then
we
know
what
we
got
to
be
after
come
across
some
of
precious
mean
continued
crinkett
a
meaner
skunk
nor
this
estated
gent
who
is
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
squire
and
all
that
i
never
did
come
across
and
i
do
suppose
i
never
shall
and
then
they
stood
looking
at
him
jeering
at
him
and
the
gardener
who
was
then
in
the
front
of
the
house
heard
it
all
said
the
squire
the
gate
for
these
gentlemen
darvell
of
course
knew
that
they
had
been
brought
from
the
church
to
the
house
and
had
been
invited
in
to
the
christening
breakfast
i
were
darvell
i
would
take
wages
from
such
a
skunk
as
you
said
crinkett
man
as
has
robbed
his
partners
of
every
shilling
and
has
married
a
young
lady
when
he
has
got
another
wife
living
out
in
the
colony
at
least
she
was
out
in
the
colony
she
ai
there
now
darvell
she
somewhere
else
now
that
what
your
master
is
darvell
you
have
to
look
out
for
a
place
because
your
master
be
in
quod
before
long
how
much
is
it
they
gets
for
bigamy
jack
three
years
at
the
treadmill
that
about
it
but
i
pities
the
young
lady
and
the
poor
little
bastard
what
was
he
to
do
a
sense
of
what
was
fitting
for
his
wife
rather
than
for
himself
forbade
him
to
fly
at
the
man
and
take
him
by
the
throat
and
now
of
course
the
wretched
story
would
be
told
through
all
cambridgeshire
nothing
could
prevent
that
now
he
said
as
he
turned
towards
the
hall
steps
must
see
these
men
off
the
premises
the
less
you
say
to
them
the
better
only
just
tell
him
all
about
it
as
we
goes
along
comfortable
said
adamson
darvell
who
was
a
good
sort
of
man
in
his
way
slow
rather
than
stupid
weighted
with
the
ordinary
respect
which
a
servant
has
for
his
master
had
heard
it
all
but
showed
no
particular
anxiety
to
hear
more
he
accompanied
the
men
down
to
the
causeway
hardly
opening
his
mouth
to
them
while
they
were
loud
in
denouncing
the
meanness
of
the
man
who
had
deserted
a
wife
in
australia
and
had
then
betrayed
a
young
lady
here
in
england
were
they
talking
about
said
his
wife
to
him
when
they
were
alone
heard
their
voices
even
here
were
threatening
me
threatening
me
and
you
that
woman
about
that
woman
not
that
they
have
dared
yet
to
mention
her
name
but
it
was
about
that
woman
she
heard
nothing
from
her
since
that
letter
i
do
not
know
that
she
is
in
england
but
i
suppose
that
she
is
with
them
it
make
you
unhappy
john
unhappy
it
frighten
you
it
makes
me
fear
that
you
for
a
while
will
be
made
miserable
you
whom
i
had
thought
that
i
could
protect
from
all
sorrow
and
from
all
care
o
my
darling
of
course
it
frightens
me
but
it
is
for
you
will
they
do
first
john
have
already
said
words
before
the
man
there
which
will
of
course
be
spread
about
the
country
words
then
he
paused
but
after
pausing
he
spoke
very
plainly
said
that
you
were
not
my
wife
i
am
you
are
me
all
truly
though
i
were
not
i
would
still
be
true
to
you
hester
hester
you
are
do
not
speak
as
though
that
were
possible
know
that
you
love
me
i
am
sure
of
that
nothing
should
ever
make
me
leave
you
nothing
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
now
whatever
you
may
have
done
i
will
be
true
to
you
only
tell
me
everything
think
i
have
he
said
hoarsely
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
told
much
to
robert
bolton
which
she
had
not
heard
did
tell
her
that
i
would
marry
her
did
i
did
not
that
a
marriage
in
some
countries
think
nowhere
certainly
not
there
and
the
people
hearing
of
it
all
used
to
call
her
by
my
name
john
will
not
that
be
against
us
will
be
against
me
in
the
minds
of
persons
like
your
mother
will
care
nothing
for
that
i
know
that
you
have
repented
and
are
sorry
i
know
that
you
love
me
now
have
always
loved
you
since
the
first
moment
that
i
saw
you
for
a
moment
believe
that
i
will
believe
them
let
them
do
what
they
will
i
will
be
your
wife
nothing
shall
take
me
away
from
you
but
it
is
sad
is
it
not
on
that
the
very
day
that
poor
baby
has
been
christened
then
they
sat
and
wept
together
and
tried
to
comfort
each
other
but
nothing
could
comfort
him
he
was
almost
prostrated
at
the
prospect
of
his
coming
misery
and
of
hers
chapter
xxix
by
telling
me
that
i
the
thunderbolt
had
fallen
now
caldigate
when
he
left
his
wife
that
he
might
stroll
about
the
place
after
the
dusk
had
fallen
told
himself
again
and
again
that
the
thunderbolt
had
certainly
fallen
now
there
could
be
no
longer
a
doubt
but
that
this
woman
would
claim
him
as
her
husband
a
whole
world
of
remorse
and
regrets
oppressed
his
conscience
and
his
heart
he
looked
back
and
remembered
the
wise
counsels
which
had
been
given
him
on
board
the
ship
when
the
captain
and
callender
and
poor
dick
shand
had
remonstrated
with
him
and
called
to
mind
his
own
annoyance
when
he
had
bidden
them
mind
their
own
affairs
and
then
he
remembered
how
he
had
determined
to
break
away
from
the
woman
at
sydney
and
to
explain
to
her
as
he
might
then
have
done
without
injustice
that
they
two
could
be
of
no
service
the
one
to
the
other
and
that
they
had
better
part
it
seemed
now
as
he
looked
back
to
have
been
so
easy
for
him
then
to
have
avoided
danger
so
easy
to
have
kept
a
straight
course
but
now
now
surely
he
would
be
overwhelmed
and
then
how
easy
it
would
have
been
had
he
been
more
careful
at
the
beginning
of
these
troubles
to
have
bought
these
wretches
off
he
had
been
he
now
acknowledged
too
peremptory
in
his
first
refusal
to
refund
a
portion
of
the
money
to
crinkett
the
application
had
indeed
been
made
without
those
proofs
as
to
the
condition
of
the
mine
which
had
since
reached
him
and
he
had
distrusted
crinkett
crinkett
he
had
known
to
be
a
man
not
to
be
trusted
but
yet
even
after
receiving
the
letter
from
euphemia
smith
the
matter
might
have
been
arranged
when
he
had
first
become
assured
that
the
new
polyeuka
company
had
failed
he
should
have
made
an
offer
even
though
euphemia
smith
had
then
commenced
her
threats
with
skill
might
he
not
have
done
it
on
this
very
day
might
he
not
have
made
the
man
understand
that
if
he
would
base
his
claim
simply
on
his
losses
and
make
it
openly
on
that
ground
then
his
claim
should
be
considered
but
now
it
was
too
late
and
the
thunderbolt
had
fallen
what
must
he
do
first
robert
bolton
had
promised
to
tell
him
on
the
morrow
whether
he
would
act
for
him
as
his
lawyer
he
felt
sure
now
that
his
would
not
do
so
but
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
have
an
answer
and
that
necessity
would
give
him
an
excuse
for
going
into
cambridge
and
showing
himself
among
the
boltons
let
his
sufferings
or
his
fears
be
what
they
might
he
would
never
confess
to
the
world
that
he
suffered
or
that
he
was
frightened
by
shutting
himself
up
he
would
be
seen
about
cambridge
walking
openly
as
though
no
reports
no
rumours
had
been
spread
about
concerning
him
he
would
go
to
the
houses
of
his
wife
relations
until
he
should
be
told
that
he
was
not
welcome
his
wife
said
to
him
that
night
it
like
a
man
i
not
bearing
it
like
a
man
is
crushing
your
very
heart
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
you
bear
it
he
asked
his
question
with
a
stern
voice
but
as
he
asked
it
he
turned
to
her
and
kissed
her
she
said
while
i
have
you
with
me
and
baby
i
can
bear
anything
while
you
will
tell
me
everything
that
happens
i
will
bear
everything
and
john
when
you
were
out
just
now
and
when
i
am
alone
and
trying
to
pray
i
told
myself
that
i
ought
not
to
be
unhappy
for
i
would
sooner
have
you
and
baby
and
all
these
troubles
than
be
back
at
chesterton
without
you
wish
you
were
back
there
i
wish
you
had
never
seen
me
you
say
that
then
i
shall
be
crushed
your
sake
my
darling
for
your
sake
for
your
sake
how
shall
i
comfort
you
when
all
those
around
you
are
saying
that
you
are
not
my
wife
telling
me
that
i
am
she
said
coming
and
kneeling
at
his
feet
and
looking
up
into
his
face
you
say
so
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
believe
no
one
who
says
the
contrary
it
was
thus
and
only
now
that
he
began
to
know
the
real
nature
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
succeeded
in
making
his
own
and
of
whom
he
found
now
that
even
her
own
friends
would
attempt
to
rob
him
will
bear
it
he
said
as
he
embraced
her
will
bear
it
if
i
can
like
a
man
those
men
were
saying
horrid
things
her
nurse
said
to
her
that
night
very
horrid
things
i
know
it
all
it
is
part
of
a
wicked
plot
to
rob
caldigate
of
his
money
it
is
astonishing
the
wickedness
that
people
will
contrive
it
is
very
very
sad
i
do
know
how
long
it
may
be
before
caldigate
can
prove
it
all
he
can
prove
it
all
course
he
can
the
truth
can
always
be
proved
at
last
i
trust
there
will
be
no
one
about
the
place
to
doubt
him
if
there
were
such
a
one
i
would
not
speak
to
him
though
it
were
my
own
father
though
it
were
my
own
mother
then
she
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
as
though
fearing
that
the
nurse
herself
might
not
be
loyal
do
think
there
will
be
any
as
knows
master
will
be
wrong
enough
for
that
said
the
nurse
understanding
what
was
expected
of
her
after
that
but
not
quite
readily
the
baby
was
once
more
trusted
to
her
on
the
following
morning
caldigate
rode
into
the
town
and
as
he
put
his
horse
up
at
the
inn
he
felt
that
the
very
ostler
had
heard
the
story
as
he
walked
along
the
street
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
he
met
knew
all
about
it
robert
bolton
would
of
course
have
heard
it
but
nevertheless
he
walked
boldly
into
the
attorney
office
his
fault
at
the
time
was
in
being
too
bold
in
manner
in
carrying
himself
somewhat
too
erect
in
assuming
too
much
confidence
in
his
eye
and
mouth
to
act
a
part
perfectly
requires
a
consummate
actor
and
there
are
phases
in
life
in
which
acting
is
absolutely
demanded
a
man
can
not
always
be
at
his
ease
but
he
should
never
seem
to
be
discomfited
for
petty
troubles
the
amount
of
acting
necessary
is
so
common
that
habit
has
made
it
almost
natural
but
when
great
sorrows
come
it
is
hard
not
to
show
them
and
harder
still
not
to
seem
to
hide
them
when
he
entered
the
private
room
he
found
that
the
old
man
was
there
with
his
son
he
shook
hands
of
course
with
both
of
them
and
then
he
stood
a
moment
silent
to
hear
how
they
would
address
him
but
as
they
also
were
silent
he
was
compelled
to
speak
hope
you
got
home
all
right
sir
yesterday
and
mrs
bolton
the
old
man
did
not
answer
but
he
turned
his
face
round
to
his
son
hear
that
you
had
that
man
crinkett
out
at
folking
yesterday
said
robert
was
there
certainly
to
my
sorrow
another
with
him
and
another
with
him
whom
i
had
also
known
at
nobble
they
were
brought
in
to
breakfast
they
afterwards
declared
that
you
had
married
a
wife
out
there
in
the
colony
also
is
true
have
been
with
my
father
this
morning
am
very
very
sorry
sir
said
caldigate
turning
to
the
old
man
you
should
have
been
troubled
in
so
disagreeable
a
business
caldigate
i
will
tell
you
what
we
propose
it
was
still
the
attorney
who
was
speaking
for
the
old
man
had
not
as
yet
opened
his
mouth
since
his
had
entered
the
room
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
that
this
woman
intends
to
bring
an
accusation
of
bigamy
against
you
is
threatening
to
do
it
i
think
it
very
improbable
that
she
will
be
fool
enough
to
make
the
attempt
what
i
have
heard
i
feel
sure
that
the
attempt
will
be
made
depositions
in
fact
will
be
made
before
the
magistrates
some
day
this
week
crinkett
and
the
woman
have
been
with
the
mayor
this
morning
and
have
been
told
the
way
in
which
they
should
proceed
caldigate
when
he
heard
this
felt
that
he
was
trembling
but
he
looked
into
the
face
without
allowing
his
eyes
to
turn
to
the
right
or
left
am
not
going
to
say
anything
now
about
the
case
itself
indeed
as
i
know
nothing
i
can
say
nothing
you
must
provide
yourself
with
a
lawyer
will
not
act
for
me
not
i
must
act
for
my
sister
now
what
i
propose
and
what
her
father
proposes
is
this
that
she
shall
return
to
her
home
at
puritan
grange
while
this
question
is
being
decided
not
said
the
husband
must
said
the
old
man
speaking
for
the
first
time
shall
compel
it
said
the
attorney
how
will
you
compel
it
she
is
my
wife
has
to
be
proved
public
opinion
will
compel
it
if
nothing
else
you
can
not
make
a
prisoner
of
her
she
shall
go
if
she
wishes
it
you
shall
have
free
access
to
her
bring
her
mother
bring
your
carriage
she
shall
dispose
of
herself
as
she
pleases
god
forbid
that
i
should
keep
her
though
she
be
my
wife
against
her
will
am
sure
she
will
do
as
her
friends
shall
advise
her
when
she
hears
the
story
said
the
attorney
has
heard
the
story
she
knows
it
all
and
i
am
sure
that
she
will
not
stir
a
foot
said
the
husband
know
nothing
about
her
this
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
and
then
again
he
turned
to
the
old
man
sir
no
doubt
are
well
aware
that
she
can
be
firm
to
her
purpose
nothing
but
death
could
take
her
away
from
me
if
you
were
to
carry
her
by
force
to
chesterton
she
would
return
to
folking
on
foot
before
the
day
was
over
she
knows
what
it
is
to
be
a
wife
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
leaving
me
this
he
was
able
to
say
with
a
high
spirit
and
an
assured
voice
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
stay
with
you
while
this
is
going
on
course
she
must
come
away
said
the
banker
not
looking
at
the
man
whom
he
now
hated
as
thoroughly
as
did
his
wife
your
own
friends
and
let
her
consult
hers
they
will
all
tell
you
so
ask
babington
ask
your
own
father
shall
ask
no
one
but
her
what
her
position
will
be
all
the
world
will
at
least
doubt
whether
she
be
your
wife
or
not
is
one
person
who
will
not
doubt
and
that
is
herself
good
if
it
be
so
that
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
no
doubt
but
for
her
sake
while
other
people
doubt
will
it
not
be
better
that
she
should
be
with
her
father
and
mother
look
at
it
all
round
think
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
be
with
me
replied
caldigate
though
your
former
marriage
with
that
other
woman
were
proved
will
not
presume
that
to
be
possible
though
a
jury
should
so
decide
their
decision
would
be
wrong
such
an
error
could
not
effect
us
i
will
not
think
of
such
a
thing
you
do
not
perceive
that
her
troubles
will
be
lighter
in
her
father
house
than
in
yours
not
to
be
away
from
her
own
house
would
be
such
a
trouble
to
her
that
she
would
not
endure
it
unless
restrained
by
force
you
press
her
she
would
go
can
not
you
see
that
it
would
be
better
for
her
name
name
is
my
name
he
said
clenching
his
fist
in
his
violence
my
name
is
hers
she
can
have
no
good
name
distinct
from
me
no
name
at
all
she
is
part
and
parcel
of
my
very
self
and
under
no
circumstances
will
i
consent
that
she
shall
be
torn
away
from
me
no
word
from
any
human
being
shall
persuade
me
to
it
unless
it
should
come
from
herself
can
make
her
said
the
old
man
doubt
we
could
get
an
order
from
the
court
said
the
attorney
thinking
that
anything
might
be
fairly
said
in
such
an
emergency
as
this
it
will
be
better
that
she
should
come
of
her
own
accord
or
by
his
direction
are
you
aware
how
probable
it
is
that
you
may
be
in
prison
within
a
day
or
two
to
this
caldigate
made
no
answer
but
turned
round
to
leave
the
room
he
paused
a
moment
at
the
doorway
to
think
whether
another
word
or
two
might
not
be
said
in
behalf
of
his
wife
it
seemed
hard
to
him
or
hard
rather
upon
her
that
all
the
solid
support
of
her
family
should
be
taken
away
from
her
at
such
a
crisis
as
the
present
he
knew
their
enmity
to
himself
he
could
understand
both
the
old
enmity
and
that
which
had
now
been
newly
engendered
both
the
one
and
the
other
were
natural
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
girl
away
from
her
parents
in
opposition
to
both
father
and
mother
and
now
almost
within
the
first
year
of
his
marriage
she
had
been
brought
to
this
terrible
misery
by
means
of
disreputable
people
with
whom
he
had
been
closely
connected
was
it
not
natural
that
robert
bolton
should
turn
against
him
if
hester
had
been
his
sister
and
there
had
come
such
an
interloper
what
would
he
have
felt
was
it
not
his
duty
to
be
gentle
and
to
give
way
if
by
any
giving
way
he
could
lessen
the
evil
which
he
had
occasioned
am
sorry
to
have
to
leave
your
presence
like
this
he
said
turning
back
to
bolton
did
you
ever
come
into
my
presence
has
been
done
is
done
even
if
i
would
give
her
back
i
can
not
for
better
or
for
worse
she
is
mine
we
can
not
make
it
otherwise
now
but
understand
this
when
you
ask
that
she
shall
come
back
to
you
i
do
not
refuse
it
on
my
own
account
though
i
should
be
miserable
indeed
were
she
to
leave
me
i
will
not
even
ask
her
to
stay
but
i
know
she
will
stay
though
i
should
try
to
drive
her
out
she
would
not
go
sir
the
old
man
only
shook
his
head
robert
you
had
better
get
some
lawyer
as
soon
as
you
can
if
you
know
any
one
in
london
you
should
send
for
him
if
not
seely
here
is
as
good
a
man
as
you
can
have
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
but
he
is
a
careful
attorney
who
understands
his
business
then
caldigate
left
the
room
with
the
intention
of
going
at
once
to
seely
but
standing
patiently
at
the
door
just
within
the
doorway
of
the
house
he
met
a
tall
man
in
dark
plain
clothes
whom
he
at
once
knew
to
be
a
policeman
the
man
who
was
aware
that
caldigate
was
a
county
magistrate
civilly
touched
his
hat
and
then
with
a
few
whispered
words
expressed
his
opinion
that
our
hero
had
better
go
with
him
to
the
mayor
office
had
he
a
warrant
yes
he
had
a
warrant
but
he
thought
that
probably
it
might
not
be
necessary
for
him
to
show
it
will
go
with
you
of
course
said
caldigate
suppose
it
is
on
the
allegation
of
a
man
named
crinkett
lady
sir
i
think
said
the
policeman
mrs
smith
called
herself
caldigate
sir
said
the
policeman
then
they
went
together
without
any
further
words
to
the
mayor
court
and
from
thence
before
he
heard
the
accusation
made
against
him
he
sent
both
for
his
father
and
for
seely
he
was
taken
through
to
a
private
room
and
thither
came
at
once
the
mayor
and
another
magistrate
of
the
town
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
is
a
very
sad
business
caldigate
said
the
mayor
sad
indeed
i
suppose
i
know
all
about
it
two
men
were
with
me
yesterday
threatening
to
indict
me
for
bigamy
if
i
did
not
give
them
a
considerable
sum
of
money
i
can
quite
understand
that
they
should
have
been
here
as
i
know
the
nature
of
the
evidence
they
can
use
the
policeman
tells
me
the
woman
is
here
too
yes
she
is
here
and
has
made
her
deposition
indeed
there
are
two
men
and
another
woman
who
all
declare
that
they
were
present
at
her
marriage
then
after
some
further
conversation
the
accusers
were
brought
into
the
room
before
him
so
that
their
depositions
might
be
read
to
him
the
woman
was
closely
veiled
so
that
he
could
not
see
a
feature
of
her
face
but
he
knew
her
figure
well
and
he
remembered
the
other
woman
who
had
been
to
euphemia
smith
when
she
had
come
up
to
the
diggings
and
who
had
been
with
her
both
at
ahalala
and
at
nobble
the
woman
name
as
he
now
brought
to
mind
was
anna
young
crinkett
also
and
adamson
followed
them
into
the
room
each
of
whom
had
made
a
deposition
on
the
matter
this
the
caldigate
said
the
mayor
you
claim
as
your
husband
is
my
husband
said
the
woman
and
i
were
married
at
ahalala
in
new
south
wales
is
false
said
caldigate
you
wish
to
see
her
face
asked
the
mayor
i
know
her
voice
well
she
is
the
woman
in
whose
company
i
went
out
to
the
colony
and
whom
i
knew
while
i
was
there
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
see
her
what
does
she
say
i
am
your
wife
john
caldigate
then
the
deposition
was
read
to
him
which
stated
on
the
part
of
the
woman
that
on
a
certain
day
she
was
married
to
him
by
the
rev
allan
a
wesleyan
minister
at
ahalala
that
the
marriage
took
place
in
a
tent
belonging
as
she
believed
to
crinkett
and
that
crinkett
adamson
and
anna
young
were
all
present
at
the
marriage
then
the
three
persons
thus
named
had
taken
their
oaths
and
made
their
depositions
to
the
same
effect
and
a
document
was
produced
purporting
to
be
a
copy
of
the
marriage
certificate
as
made
out
by
allan
copy
which
she
the
woman
stated
that
she
obtained
at
the
time
the
register
itself
which
consisted
simply
of
an
entry
in
a
small
book
having
been
carried
away
by
allan
in
his
pocket
crinkett
when
asked
what
had
become
of
allan
stated
that
he
knew
nothing
but
that
he
had
left
ahalala
from
that
day
to
this
none
of
them
had
heard
of
allan
then
the
mayor
gave
caldigate
to
understand
that
he
must
hold
himself
as
committed
to
stand
his
trial
for
bigamy
at
the
next
assizes
for
the
county
chapter
xxx
the
conclave
at
puritan
grange
john
caldigate
was
committed
and
liberated
on
bail
this
occurred
in
cambridge
on
the
wednesday
after
the
christening
and
before
the
saturday
night
following
all
the
boltons
were
thoroughly
convinced
that
this
wretched
man
who
had
taken
from
them
their
daughter
and
their
sister
was
a
bigamist
and
that
poor
hester
though
a
mother
was
not
a
wife
the
evidence
against
him
already
named
was
very
strong
but
they
had
been
put
in
possession
of
other
and
as
they
thought
more
damning
evidence
than
any
to
which
he
had
alluded
in
telling
his
version
of
the
story
to
robert
bolton
the
woman
had
produced
and
had
shown
to
robert
bolton
the
envelope
of
a
letter
addressed
in
john
handwriting
to
caldigate
ahalala
nobble
which
letter
had
been
dated
inside
from
sydney
and
which
envelope
bore
the
sydney
postmark
caldigate
handwriting
was
peculiar
and
the
attorney
declared
that
he
could
himself
swear
to
it
the
letter
itself
she
also
produced
but
it
told
less
than
the
envelope
it
began
as
such
a
letter
might
begin
feemy
and
ended
ever
and
always
as
she
herself
had
pointed
out
a
man
such
as
caldigate
does
not
usually
call
his
wife
by
that
most
cherished
name
in
writing
to
her
the
letter
itself
referred
almost
altogether
to
money
matters
though
perhaps
hardly
to
such
as
a
man
generally
discusses
with
his
wife
certain
phrases
seemed
to
imply
a
distinct
action
she
had
better
sell
these
shares
or
those
if
she
could
for
a
certain
price
and
suchlike
but
she
explained
that
they
both
when
they
married
had
been
possessed
of
mining
shares
represented
by
scrip
which
passed
from
hand
to
hand
readily
and
that
each
still
retained
his
or
her
own
property
but
among
the
various
small
documents
which
she
had
treasured
up
for
use
should
they
be
needed
for
some
possible
occasion
such
as
this
was
a
note
which
had
not
indeed
been
posted
but
which
purported
to
have
been
written
by
the
minister
allan
to
caldigate
himself
offering
to
perform
the
marriage
at
ahalala
but
advising
him
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
at
some
more
settled
place
where
an
established
church
community
with
a
permanent
church
or
chapel
admitted
the
proper
custody
of
registers
nothing
could
be
more
sensible
or
written
in
a
better
spirit
than
this
letter
though
the
language
was
not
that
of
an
educated
man
this
letter
caldigate
had
she
said
showed
to
her
and
she
had
retained
it
then
she
brought
forward
two
handkerchiefs
which
she
herself
had
marked
with
her
new
name
euphemia
caldigate
and
the
date
of
the
year
this
had
been
done
she
declared
immediately
after
her
marriage
and
the
handkerchiefs
seemed
by
their
appearance
to
justify
the
assertion
caldigate
had
admitted
a
promise
admitted
that
he
had
lived
with
the
woman
admitted
that
she
had
passed
by
his
name
admitted
that
there
had
been
a
conversation
with
the
clergyman
in
regard
to
his
marriage
and
now
there
were
three
others
besides
the
woman
herself
who
were
ready
to
swear
who
had
sworn
that
they
had
witnessed
the
ceremony
a
clerk
had
been
sent
out
early
in
november
by
robert
and
william
bolton
to
make
inquiry
in
the
colony
and
he
could
not
well
return
before
the
end
of
march
and
if
the
accused
man
should
ask
for
delay
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
refuse
the
request
as
it
might
be
necessary
for
his
defence
that
he
too
should
get
evidence
from
the
colony
the
next
assizes
would
be
in
april
and
it
would
hardly
be
possible
that
the
trial
should
take
place
so
soon
and
if
not
there
would
be
a
delay
of
three
or
four
months
more
even
that
might
hardly
suffice
should
a
plea
be
made
on
caldigate
behalf
that
prolonged
inquiry
was
indispensable
a
thousand
allegations
might
be
made
as
to
the
characters
of
these
witnesses
characters
which
doubtless
were
open
to
criticism
as
to
the
probability
of
forgery
as
to
the
necessity
of
producing
allan
the
clergyman
as
to
smith
former
position
whether
or
no
she
was
in
truth
a
widow
when
she
was
living
at
ahalala
richard
shand
had
been
at
ahalala
and
must
have
known
the
truth
caldigate
might
well
declare
that
richard
shand
presence
was
essential
to
his
defence
there
would
and
must
be
delay
but
what
in
the
meantime
would
be
the
condition
of
hester
hester
bolton
as
they
feared
that
they
would
be
bound
in
duty
to
call
her
of
hester
and
her
infant
the
thing
was
so
full
of
real
tragedy
true
human
nature
of
them
all
was
so
strongly
affected
that
for
a
time
family
jealousies
and
hatred
had
to
give
way
to
father
and
mother
and
to
the
brothers
and
to
the
brother
wife
it
was
equally
a
catastrophe
terrible
limitless
like
an
earthquake
or
the
falling
upon
them
of
some
ruined
tower
one
thing
was
clear
to
them
all
that
she
and
her
child
must
be
taken
away
from
folking
her
continued
residence
there
would
be
a
continuation
of
the
horror
the
man
was
not
her
husband
not
one
of
them
was
inspired
by
a
feeling
of
mercy
to
allege
that
in
spite
of
all
that
they
had
heard
he
still
might
be
her
husband
even
robert
who
had
been
most
in
favour
of
the
caldigate
marriage
did
not
doubt
for
an
instant
the
man
had
been
a
gambler
at
home
on
racecourses
and
then
had
become
a
gambler
at
the
in
the
colony
his
life
then
by
his
own
admission
had
been
disreputable
who
does
not
know
that
vices
which
may
be
treated
with
tenderness
almost
with
complaisance
while
they
are
kept
in
the
background
became
monstrous
prodigious
when
they
are
made
public
a
gentleman
shall
casually
let
slip
some
profane
word
and
even
some
friendly
parson
standing
by
will
think
but
little
of
it
but
let
the
profane
word
through
some
unfortunate
accident
find
its
way
into
the
newspapers
and
the
gentleman
will
be
held
to
have
disgraced
himself
almost
for
ever
had
nothing
been
said
of
a
marriage
between
caldigate
and
smith
little
would
have
been
thought
by
robert
bolton
little
perhaps
by
robert
bolton
father
little
even
by
robert
bolton
wife
of
the
unfortunate
alliance
which
he
had
admitted
but
now
everything
was
added
to
make
a
pile
of
wickedness
as
big
as
a
mountain
from
the
conclave
which
was
held
on
saturday
at
puritan
grange
to
decide
what
should
be
done
it
was
impossible
to
exclude
bolton
she
was
the
young
mother
mother
and
how
should
she
be
excluded
from
the
first
moment
in
which
something
of
the
truth
had
reached
her
ears
it
had
become
impossible
to
silence
her
or
to
exclude
her
to
her
all
those
former
faults
would
have
been
black
as
vice
itself
even
though
there
had
been
no
question
of
a
former
marriage
outside
active
sins
to
which
it
may
be
presumed
no
temptation
allured
herself
were
abominable
to
her
evil
thoughts
hardness
of
heart
suspicions
unforgivingness
hatred
being
too
impalpable
for
denunciation
in
the
decalogue
but
lying
nearer
to
the
hearts
of
most
men
than
murder
theft
adultery
and
perjury
were
not
equally
abhorrent
to
her
she
had
therefore
allowed
herself
to
believe
all
evil
of
this
man
and
from
the
very
first
had
set
him
down
in
her
heart
as
a
hopeless
sinner
the
others
had
opposed
her
because
the
man
had
money
in
the
midst
of
her
shipwreck
in
the
midst
of
her
misery
through
all
her
maternal
agony
there
was
a
certain
triumph
to
her
in
this
she
had
been
right
right
from
first
to
last
right
in
everything
her
poor
old
husband
was
crushed
by
the
feeling
that
they
had
among
them
allowed
this
miscreant
to
take
their
darling
away
from
them
that
he
himself
had
assented
but
she
had
not
assented
she
was
not
crushed
before
monday
night
all
cambridge
had
heard
something
of
the
story
and
then
it
had
been
impossible
to
keep
her
in
the
dark
and
now
when
the
conclave
met
of
course
she
was
one
the
old
man
was
there
and
robert
bolton
and
william
the
barrister
who
had
come
down
from
london
to
give
his
advice
and
both
and
daniel
daniel
of
all
the
females
of
the
family
was
the
readiest
to
endure
the
severity
of
the
and
she
was
now
giving
what
comfort
she
could
by
her
attendance
at
the
grange
course
she
should
come
home
said
the
barrister
up
to
this
moment
no
one
had
seen
hester
since
the
evil
tidings
had
been
made
known
but
a
messenger
had
been
sent
out
to
folking
with
a
long
letter
from
her
mother
in
which
the
poor
nameless
one
had
been
implored
to
come
back
with
her
baby
to
her
old
home
till
this
matter
had
been
settled
the
writer
had
endeavoured
to
avoid
the
saying
of
hard
things
against
the
sinner
but
her
feelings
had
been
made
very
clear
father
and
brothers
and
all
of
us
think
that
you
should
come
away
from
him
while
this
is
pending
nay
we
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
it
is
your
bounden
duty
to
leave
him
will
never
never
leave
my
dearest
dearest
husband
if
they
were
to
put
my
husband
into
gaol
i
would
sit
at
the
door
till
they
had
let
him
out
that
repeated
over
and
over
again
had
been
the
purport
of
her
reply
and
that
word
she
used
in
almost
every
line
having
only
too
clearly
observed
that
her
mother
had
not
used
it
at
all
mother
she
said
ending
her
letter
love
you
as
i
have
always
done
but
when
i
became
his
wife
i
swore
to
love
him
best
i
did
not
know
then
how
strong
my
love
could
be
i
have
hardly
known
till
now
when
he
is
troubled
of
what
devotion
i
was
capable
i
will
not
leave
him
for
a
moment
unless
i
have
to
do
so
at
his
telling
such
being
her
determination
and
so
great
her
obstinacy
it
was
quite
clear
that
they
could
not
by
soft
words
or
persuasive
letters
bring
her
to
their
way
of
thinking
she
would
not
submit
to
their
authority
but
would
claim
that
as
a
married
woman
she
owed
obedience
only
to
her
husband
and
it
would
certainly
not
be
within
their
power
to
make
her
believe
that
she
was
not
caldigate
wife
they
believed
it
they
felt
that
they
knew
the
facts
to
them
any
continuation
of
the
alliance
between
their
poor
girl
and
the
false
traitor
was
abominable
they
would
have
hung
the
man
without
a
moment
thought
of
mercy
had
it
been
possible
there
was
nothing
they
would
not
have
done
to
rescue
their
hester
from
his
power
but
how
was
she
to
be
rescued
till
the
dilatory
law
should
have
claimed
its
victim
she
be
made
to
come
away
by
the
police
asked
the
mother
the
barrister
shook
his
head
the
magistrates
give
an
order
asked
the
father
bolton
had
been
a
magistrate
himself
was
one
still
indeed
although
for
some
years
he
had
not
sat
upon
the
bench
but
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
a
magistrate
power
the
barrister
again
shook
his
head
seemed
to
think
that
something
of
the
kind
could
be
done
he
said
turning
to
robert
when
he
wanted
advice
he
would
always
turn
to
robert
especially
in
the
presence
of
the
barrister
intending
to
show
that
he
thought
the
lower
branch
of
the
profession
to
be
at
any
rate
more
accurate
than
the
higher
said
something
about
an
order
from
the
but
i
fear
we
should
not
succeed
in
getting
it
the
barrister
again
shook
his
head
you
mean
to
say
that
nothing
can
be
done
exclaimed
bolton
rising
up
from
her
seat
no
steps
can
be
taken
she
were
once
here
perhaps
you
could
prevent
her
return
whispered
the
barrister
her
not
to
go
back
suggested
daniel
that
might
come
after
a
time
but
i
think
you
would
have
the
feeling
of
the
community
with
you
if
you
succeeded
well
not
violence
you
understand
not
violence
said
the
father
could
be
violent
with
him
said
bolton
do
not
let
her
leave
the
house
continued
the
barrister
course
it
would
be
disagreeable
should
not
mind
that
said
bolton
doing
my
duty
i
could
bear
anything
to
separate
her
from
him
i
could
undergo
any
trouble
he
would
have
the
power
to
fetch
her
asked
the
father
doubtfully
doubt
by
law
he
would
have
such
power
but
the
magistrates
would
be
very
loath
to
assist
him
the
feeling
of
the
community
as
i
said
would
be
in
your
favour
she
would
be
cowed
and
when
once
she
was
away
from
him
he
would
probably
feel
averse
to
increase
our
enmity
by
taking
strong
measures
for
her
recovery
bolton
seemed
to
declare
by
her
face
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
increase
her
enmity
we
ca
lock
her
up
said
the
old
man
you
can
take
her
bonnet
away
or
whatever
she
came
in
do
let
there
be
a
vehicle
to
carry
her
back
let
the
keys
be
turned
if
it
be
necessary
the
servants
must
know
of
course
what
you
are
doing
but
they
will
probably
be
on
your
side
i
do
mean
to
say
that
if
she
be
resolute
to
escape
at
any
cost
you
can
prevent
her
but
probably
she
will
not
be
resolute
like
that
it
requires
a
deal
of
resolution
for
a
young
woman
to
show
herself
in
the
streets
alone
in
so
wretched
a
plight
as
hers
it
depends
on
her
disposition
is
very
determined
said
hester
mother
you
can
be
equally
so
to
this
assertion
bolton
assented
with
a
little
nod
can
only
try
it
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
unfortunately
publicity
can
not
be
avoided
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
her
poor
dear
according
to
our
conscience
i
should
induce
her
to
come
on
a
visit
to
her
mother
and
then
i
should
if
possible
detain
her
it
was
thus
that
william
bolton
gave
his
advice
and
as
robert
bolton
assented
it
was
determined
that
this
should
be
the
line
of
action
nor
can
it
be
said
that
they
were
either
cruel
or
unloving
in
their
projected
scheme
believing
as
they
did
that
the
man
was
not
her
husband
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
was
their
duty
to
take
her
away
from
him
if
possible
but
it
was
not
probable
that
hester
herself
would
look
upon
their
care
of
her
in
the
same
light
she
would
beat
herself
against
the
bars
of
her
cage
and
even
should
she
be
prevented
from
escaping
by
the
motives
and
reasons
which
william
bolton
had
suggested
she
would
not
the
less
regard
her
father
and
mother
as
wicked
tyrants
the
mother
understood
that
very
well
and
she
though
she
was
hard
to
all
the
world
besides
had
never
been
hard
to
her
girl
no
tenderest
female
bosom
that
ever
panted
at
injustice
done
to
her
offspring
was
more
full
than
hers
of
pity
love
and
desire
to
save
her
hester
from
sin
and
suffering
she
would
willingly
lay
down
her
life
and
she
knew
that
in
carrying
out
the
scheme
that
had
been
proposed
she
must
appear
to
her
girl
to
be
an
enemy
to
be
the
bitterest
of
all
enemies
i
have
seen
a
mother
force
open
the
convulsively
closed
jaws
of
her
child
in
order
that
some
agonising
torture
might
be
applied
which
though
agonising
would
tend
to
save
her
sick
infant
life
she
did
it
though
the
child
shrank
from
her
as
from
some
torturing
fiend
this
mother
resolved
that
she
would
do
the
same
though
her
child
too
should
learn
to
hate
her
william
bolton
undertook
to
go
out
to
folking
and
give
the
invitation
by
which
she
was
to
be
allured
to
come
to
puritan
grange
only
for
a
day
and
night
if
longer
absence
was
objectionable
only
for
a
morning
visit
if
no
more
could
be
achieved
it
was
all
treachery
and
falsehood
a
doing
of
certain
evil
that
possible
good
might
come
from
it
will
hate
me
for
ever
but
yet
it
ought
to
be
done
said
william
bolton
who
was
a
good
man
an
excellent
husband
and
father
and
regarded
in
his
own
profession
as
an
honourable
trustworthy
man
will
never
stay
the
old
man
said
to
his
wife
when
the
others
had
gone
and
they
two
were
left
together
do
know
am
sure
she
will
never
stay
will
try
robert
said
the
same
thing
when
the
scheme
was
explained
to
her
you
think
anybody
could
keep
me
a
prisoner
against
my
will
unless
they
locked
me
up
in
a
cell
do
you
think
i
would
not
scream
the
husband
endeavoured
to
explain
that
the
screaming
might
depend
on
the
causes
which
had
produced
the
coercion
think
you
would
scream
and
scream
till
you
were
let
loose
if
the
person
locking
you
up
had
nothing
to
justify
him
but
if
you
felt
that
the
world
would
be
all
against
you
then
you
would
not
scream
and
would
not
be
let
out
robert
however
seemed
to
think
that
no
one
could
keep
her
in
any
house
against
her
own
will
without
positive
bolts
bars
and
chains
in
the
meantime
much
had
been
settled
out
at
folking
or
had
been
settled
at
cambridge
so
that
the
details
were
known
at
folking
seely
had
taken
up
the
case
and
had
of
course
gone
into
it
with
much
more
minuteness
than
robert
bolton
had
done
caldigate
owned
to
the
writing
of
the
envelope
and
to
the
writing
of
the
letter
but
declared
that
that
letter
had
not
been
sent
in
that
envelope
he
had
written
the
envelope
in
some
foolish
joke
while
at
ahalala
he
remembered
doing
it
well
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
it
had
never
passed
through
the
sydney
the
letter
itself
had
been
written
from
sydney
he
remembered
writing
that
also
and
he
remembered
posting
it
at
sydney
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
smith
when
seely
assured
him
that
he
himself
had
seen
the
stamp
of
sydney
on
the
cover
caldigate
declared
that
it
must
have
been
passed
through
the
for
fraudulent
purposes
after
it
had
left
his
hands
said
seely
fraud
must
have
been
meditated
and
prepared
three
years
ago
which
is
hardly
probable
as
to
the
letter
from
the
clergyman
allan
of
which
seely
had
procured
a
copy
caldigate
declared
that
it
had
certainly
never
been
addressed
to
him
he
had
never
received
any
letter
from
allan
had
never
seen
the
man
handwriting
he
was
quite
sure
that
if
he
were
in
new
south
wales
he
could
get
a
dozen
people
to
swear
that
there
had
never
been
such
a
marriage
at
ahalala
he
did
name
many
people
especially
dick
shand
then
seely
proposed
to
send
out
an
agent
to
the
colony
who
should
take
the
depositions
of
such
witnesses
as
he
could
find
and
who
should
if
possible
bring
dick
shand
back
with
him
and
at
whatever
cost
search
should
be
made
for
allan
and
allan
should
if
found
be
brought
to
england
if
money
could
bring
him
if
allan
could
not
be
found
some
document
written
by
him
might
perhaps
be
obtained
with
reference
to
his
handwriting
but
through
it
all
seely
did
believe
that
there
had
been
some
marriage
ceremony
between
his
client
and
euphemia
smith
all
this
down
to
the
smallest
detail
was
told
to
hester
hester
bolton
or
hester
caldigate
whichever
she
might
be
and
there
was
no
word
uttered
by
the
man
she
claimed
as
her
husband
which
she
did
not
believe
as
though
it
were
gospel
chapter
xxxi
hester
is
lured
back
on
the
monday
morning
william
bolton
the
barrister
who
had
much
to
his
own
inconvenience
remained
at
cambridge
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
scheme
which
he
had
proposed
went
over
to
folking
in
a
fly
he
had
never
been
at
the
place
before
and
was
personally
less
well
acquainted
with
the
family
into
which
his
sister
had
married
than
any
other
bolton
had
everything
been
pleasant
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
such
a
visit
but
as
things
were
very
far
from
pleasant
hester
was
much
surprised
when
he
was
shown
into
her
room
it
had
been
known
to
robert
bolton
that
caldigate
now
came
every
day
into
cambridge
to
see
either
his
lawyer
or
his
father
and
that
therefore
he
would
certainly
not
be
found
at
home
about
the
middle
of
the
day
it
was
henceforth
to
be
a
law
with
all
the
boltons
at
any
rate
till
after
the
trial
that
they
would
not
speak
to
or
if
possible
see
john
caldigate
not
without
very
strong
cause
would
william
bolton
have
entered
his
house
but
that
strong
cause
existed
william
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
hester
rushing
into
her
brother
arms
too
am
glad
to
see
you
hester
though
the
time
is
so
sad
to
us
all
yes
it
is
sad
oh
so
sad
is
it
not
terrible
that
there
should
be
people
so
wicked
and
that
they
should
be
able
to
cause
so
much
trouble
to
innocent
persons
all
my
heart
i
feel
for
you
said
the
brother
caressing
his
young
sister
with
quickest
instinct
she
immediately
perceived
that
a
slight
emphasis
given
to
the
word
implied
the
singular
number
she
drew
herself
back
a
little
still
feeling
however
that
no
offence
had
as
yet
been
committed
against
which
she
could
express
her
indignation
but
it
was
necessary
that
a
protest
should
be
made
at
once
am
so
sorry
that
my
husband
is
not
here
to
welcome
you
he
has
gone
into
cambridge
to
fetch
his
father
poor
caldigate
is
so
troubled
by
all
this
that
he
prefers
now
to
come
and
stay
with
us
indeed
i
dare
say
it
will
be
better
that
the
father
and
the
son
should
be
together
and
son
or
even
mother
and
daughter
are
not
like
husbands
and
wives
are
they
they
are
not
said
the
barrister
not
quite
knowing
how
to
answer
so
very
a
proposition
but
understanding
accurately
the
line
of
thought
which
had
rendered
it
necessary
for
the
poor
creature
to
reassert
at
every
moment
the
bond
by
which
she
would
fain
be
bound
to
the
father
of
her
child
caldigate
is
so
good
so
good
and
gentle
to
me
and
baby
that
i
am
delighted
that
he
should
be
here
with
john
you
know
of
all
this
i
know
of
course
will
feel
all
that
john
has
to
suffer
is
very
bad
very
bad
for
everybody
concerned
by
his
own
showing
his
conduct
said
she
this
be
settled
in
one
word
i
will
not
hear
a
syllable
against
my
husband
from
you
or
any
one
else
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
i
can
not
tell
you
how
delighted
oh
if
papa
would
come
or
mamma
dear
dear
mamma
you
do
suppose
but
what
i
love
you
all
am
sure
you
do
not
from
papa
or
mamma
even
will
i
hear
a
word
against
him
would
fanny
fanny
was
the
barrister
wife
her
people
come
and
say
things
behind
your
back
hope
not
believe
that
i
can
be
as
stout
as
fanny
but
we
need
not
quarrel
you
will
come
and
see
baby
and
have
some
lunch
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
be
here
till
three
or
four
but
they
will
be
so
glad
to
see
you
if
you
will
wait
he
would
not
wait
of
course
but
he
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
away
to
see
baby
and
did
eat
his
lunch
then
he
brought
forward
the
purport
of
his
mission
mother
is
most
anxious
to
see
you
hester
you
will
go
and
visit
her
yes
said
hester
unaware
of
any
danger
i
wish
she
would
come
to
me
dear
girl
as
things
are
at
present
that
is
impossible
you
can
understand
as
much
as
that
there
must
be
a
trial
suppose
so
till
that
has
been
held
your
mother
would
be
wrong
to
come
here
i
express
no
judgment
against
any
one
should
have
thought
mamma
would
have
been
the
first
to
support
me
me
and
baby
she
said
sobbing
if
you
were
homeless
i
am
not
my
husband
gives
me
a
house
to
live
in
and
i
want
none
other
i
wish
to
explain
is
that
if
you
were
in
want
of
anything
am
in
want
of
nothing
but
sympathy
have
it
from
me
and
from
all
of
us
but
pray
listen
for
a
moment
she
can
not
come
to
you
till
the
trial
be
over
i
am
sure
caldigate
would
understand
that
comes
to
me
she
said
alluding
to
her
and
not
choosing
to
understand
that
her
brother
should
have
called
her
husband
caldigate
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
go
to
chesterton
to
see
mamma
a
day
or
two
he
replied
blushing
inwardly
at
his
own
lie
you
go
no
not
to
stay
of
course
i
must
ask
my
husband
i
sure
let
me
go
if
i
ask
it
but
not
why
that
your
mother
longs
to
see
you
he
had
been
specially
instigated
to
induce
her
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
may
imagine
how
anxious
she
is
mamma
yes
i
know
she
suffers
i
know
mamma
feelings
mamma
and
i
must
must
must
quarrel
if
we
talk
about
this
of
course
i
will
go
to
see
her
but
will
you
tell
her
this
that
if
she
can
not
speak
of
my
husband
with
affection
and
respect
it
will
be
better
that
she
should
not
mention
him
at
all
i
will
not
submit
to
a
word
even
from
her
when
he
took
his
departure
it
was
settled
that
she
should
with
her
husband
permission
go
over
to
chesterton
for
a
couple
of
nights
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
but
that
she
could
not
fix
the
day
till
she
had
seen
him
then
when
he
was
taking
his
departure
and
kissing
her
once
again
she
whispered
a
word
to
him
and
be
charitable
william
i
sometimes
think
that
at
chesterton
we
hardly
knew
what
charity
meant
that
evening
the
proposed
visit
to
chesterton
was
discussed
at
folking
the
old
man
had
very
strongly
taken
up
his
son
side
and
was
of
opinion
that
the
boltons
were
not
only
uncharitable
but
perversely
in
the
view
which
they
took
to
his
thinking
crinkett
adamson
and
the
woman
were
greedy
fraudulent
scoundrels
who
had
brought
forward
this
charge
solely
with
the
view
of
extorting
money
he
declared
that
the
very
fact
that
they
had
begun
by
asking
for
money
should
have
barred
their
evidence
before
any
magistrates
the
oaths
of
the
four
were
according
to
him
worth
nothing
the
scrap
of
paper
purporting
to
be
a
copy
of
the
marriage
certificate
and
the
clergyman
pretended
letter
were
mere
forgeries
having
about
them
no
evidence
or
probability
of
truth
any
one
could
have
written
them
as
to
that
envelope
addressed
to
caldigate
with
the
sydney
postmark
he
had
his
own
theory
he
thought
but
little
of
the
intercourse
which
his
son
acknowledged
with
the
woman
but
was
of
opinion
that
his
son
been
an
ass
in
writing
those
words
but
a
man
does
not
marry
a
woman
by
simply
writing
his
own
name
with
the
word
mistress
prefixed
to
it
on
an
envelope
any
other
woman
might
have
adduced
the
envelope
as
evidence
of
his
marriage
with
her
it
was
he
said
monstrous
that
any
one
should
give
credence
to
such
bundles
of
lies
therefore
his
words
were
gospel
and
his
wishes
were
laws
to
hester
she
clung
round
him
and
hovered
over
him
and
patted
him
like
a
very
daughter
insisting
that
he
should
nurse
the
baby
and
talking
of
him
to
her
husband
as
though
he
were
manifestly
the
wisest
man
in
cambridgeshire
she
forgot
even
that
little
flaw
in
his
religious
belief
to
her
thinking
at
the
present
moment
a
man
who
would
believe
that
her
baby
was
the
honest
son
of
an
honest
father
and
mother
had
almost
religion
enough
for
all
purposes
right
that
you
should
go
said
the
old
man
think
so
said
the
husband
i
am
afraid
they
will
trouble
her
only
question
is
whether
they
will
let
her
come
back
exclaimed
hester
they
wo
keep
you
when
they
got
you
wo
be
kept
i
will
come
back
you
do
suppose
i
let
them
talk
me
over
my
dear
i
do
think
they
be
able
to
do
that
but
there
are
such
things
as
bolts
and
bars
said
his
son
you
mean
that
they
send
me
to
prison
asked
hester
they
ca
do
that
they
would
take
you
in
at
the
county
jail
but
they
might
make
a
prison
of
puritan
grange
i
do
say
they
will
but
they
might
try
it
should
get
out
of
course
daresay
you
would
but
there
might
be
trouble
would
not
allow
that
said
hester
understands
better
than
that
i
a
right
to
go
where
i
like
just
as
anybody
else
that
is
if
john
tells
me
the
matter
was
discussed
at
some
length
but
john
caldigate
was
of
opinion
that
no
such
attempt
as
the
old
man
had
suggested
was
probable
or
even
possible
the
idea
that
in
these
days
any
one
should
be
kept
a
prisoner
in
a
private
house
any
one
over
whom
no
one
in
that
house
possessed
legitimate
authority
seemed
to
him
to
be
monstrous
that
a
husband
should
lock
up
his
wife
might
be
possible
or
a
father
his
unmarried
and
dependent
daughter
but
that
any
one
should
venture
to
lock
up
another
man
wife
was
he
declared
out
of
the
question
caldigate
again
said
that
he
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
were
attempted
but
acknowledged
that
the
attempt
could
hardly
be
successful
as
hester
was
anxious
to
make
the
visit
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
go
it
was
not
that
she
expected
much
pleasure
even
in
seeing
her
mother
but
that
it
was
expedient
at
such
a
time
to
maintain
what
fellowship
might
still
be
possible
with
her
own
family
the
trial
would
of
course
liberate
them
from
all
their
trouble
and
then
when
the
trial
should
be
over
it
would
be
very
sad
if
an
entire
rupture
between
herself
and
her
parents
should
have
been
created
she
would
be
true
to
her
husband
as
true
as
a
part
must
be
to
the
whole
as
the
heart
must
to
the
brain
they
two
were
and
ever
would
be
one
but
if
her
mother
could
be
spared
to
her
if
she
could
be
saved
from
a
lasting
quarrel
with
her
mother
it
would
be
so
much
to
her
tears
came
into
the
eyes
even
of
the
old
man
as
he
assented
and
her
husband
swore
to
her
that
for
her
sake
he
would
forgive
every
injury
from
any
one
bearing
the
name
of
bolton
when
all
this
should
be
over
a
day
was
therefore
fixed
and
a
note
was
written
and
on
the
last
day
of
february
she
and
her
baby
and
her
nurse
were
taken
over
to
puritan
grange
in
the
meantime
telegrams
at
a
very
great
cost
had
been
flying
backwards
and
forwards
between
cambridge
and
sydney
william
and
robert
bolton
had
determined
among
them
that
at
whatever
expense
to
the
family
the
truth
must
be
ascertained
and
to
this
the
old
banker
had
assented
so
far
they
were
right
no
doubt
if
the
daughter
and
sister
was
not
in
truth
a
wife
if
by
grossest
by
most
cruel
she
had
been
lured
to
a
ruin
for
which
there
could
be
no
remedy
in
this
world
it
would
be
better
that
the
fact
should
be
known
at
once
so
that
her
life
might
be
pure
though
it
could
never
again
be
bright
but
it
was
strange
that
with
all
these
boltons
there
was
a
desire
an
anxiety
to
prove
the
man
guilt
rather
than
his
innocence
bolton
had
always
regarded
him
as
a
guilty
man
though
guilty
of
she
knew
not
what
she
had
always
predicted
misery
from
a
marriage
so
distasteful
to
her
and
her
husband
though
he
had
been
brought
to
oppose
her
and
to
sanction
the
marriage
had
from
the
moment
in
which
the
sanction
was
given
been
induced
by
her
influence
to
reject
it
robert
bolton
when
the
charge
was
first
made
when
the
letter
from
the
woman
was
first
shown
to
him
had
become
aware
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
allowing
this
trouble
to
come
upon
the
family
and
then
as
from
point
to
point
the
evidence
had
been
opened
out
to
him
he
had
gradually
convinced
himself
that
the
and
whom
he
had
as
it
were
forced
into
the
family
was
a
bigamist
there
was
present
to
them
all
an
intense
desire
to
prove
the
man
guilt
which
was
startling
to
all
around
who
heard
anything
of
the
matter
up
to
this
time
the
bolton
telegrams
and
the
caldigate
telegrams
had
elicited
two
facts
that
allan
the
wesleyan
minister
had
gone
to
the
fiji
islands
and
had
there
died
and
that
they
at
nobble
who
had
last
known
dick
shand
address
now
knew
it
no
longer
caldigate
had
himself
gone
to
pollington
and
had
there
ascertained
that
no
tidings
had
been
received
from
dick
by
any
of
the
shand
family
for
the
last
twelve
months
it
had
been
decided
that
the
trial
must
be
postponed
at
any
rate
till
the
summer
assizes
which
would
be
held
in
cambridge
about
the
last
week
in
august
and
it
was
thought
by
some
that
even
then
the
case
would
not
be
ready
there
was
no
doubt
an
opinion
prevalent
in
cambridge
that
the
unfortunate
young
mother
should
be
taken
home
to
her
own
family
till
the
matter
should
be
decided
and
among
the
ladies
of
the
town
john
caldigate
himself
was
blamed
severely
for
not
allowing
her
to
place
herself
under
her
protection
but
the
ladies
of
the
town
generally
were
not
probably
well
acquainted
with
the
disposition
and
temper
of
the
young
wife
herself
things
were
in
this
condition
when
hester
and
her
baby
went
to
her
father
house
though
that
suspicion
as
to
some
intended
durance
which
caldigate
had
expressed
was
not
credited
by
her
still
as
she
was
driven
up
to
the
house
the
idea
was
in
her
mind
she
looked
at
the
door
and
she
looked
at
the
window
and
she
could
not
conceive
it
possible
that
such
a
thing
should
be
attempted
she
thought
of
her
own
knowledge
of
the
house
how
if
it
were
necessary
she
could
escape
from
the
back
of
the
garden
into
the
little
field
running
down
to
the
river
and
how
she
could
cross
the
ferry
of
course
she
knew
every
outlet
and
inlet
about
the
place
and
was
sure
that
confinement
would
be
impossible
but
she
did
not
think
of
her
bonnet
nor
of
her
boots
nor
of
the
horror
which
it
would
be
to
her
should
she
be
driven
to
wander
forth
into
the
town
and
to
seek
a
conveyance
back
to
folking
in
the
public
streets
she
went
on
a
monday
with
an
understanding
that
she
was
to
remain
there
till
wednesday
bolton
almost
wished
that
a
shorter
visit
had
been
arranged
in
order
that
she
might
at
once
commence
her
hostile
operations
without
any
intermediate
and
hypocritical
pretences
she
had
planned
her
campaign
thoroughly
in
her
own
mind
and
had
taken
the
cook
into
her
confidence
the
cook
being
the
oldest
and
most
religious
servant
in
the
house
when
the
day
of
departure
should
have
come
the
cook
was
to
lock
the
doors
and
the
gardener
was
to
close
the
little
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
the
bonnet
and
other
things
were
to
be
removed
and
then
the
mother
would
declare
her
purpose
but
in
the
meantime
allusions
to
that
intended
return
to
folking
must
be
accepted
and
listened
to
with
false
assent
it
was
very
grievous
but
so
it
was
arranged
as
soon
as
hester
was
in
the
house
the
mother
felt
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
declare
to
her
daughter
at
once
that
she
was
a
prisoner
but
it
was
then
too
late
to
alter
their
proposed
plans
it
very
nearly
came
to
pass
that
hester
left
her
mother
on
the
morning
of
her
arrival
they
had
both
determined
to
be
cautious
reticent
and
forbearing
but
the
difference
between
them
was
so
vital
that
reticence
was
impossible
at
first
there
was
a
profusion
of
natural
tears
and
a
profusion
of
embraces
each
clung
to
the
other
for
a
while
as
though
some
feeling
might
be
satisfied
by
mere
contact
and
then
the
woe
of
the
thing
the
woe
of
it
was
acknowledged
on
both
sides
they
could
agree
that
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
was
very
wicked
wherever
might
lie
the
sin
of
fraud
and
falsehood
the
unmerited
misfortunes
of
poor
hester
were
palpable
enough
they
could
weep
together
over
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
that
darling
baby
but
by
degrees
it
was
impossible
to
abstain
from
alluding
to
the
cause
of
their
sorrow
and
such
allusion
became
absolutely
necessary
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
persuade
hester
to
remain
at
her
old
home
with
her
own
consent
this
was
done
by
her
father
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
in
compliance
with
the
plan
that
had
been
arranged
papa
no
i
can
not
do
that
she
said
with
a
tone
of
angry
determination
is
your
duty
hester
all
your
friends
will
tell
you
so
duty
is
to
my
husband
she
said
in
such
a
matter
i
can
allow
myself
to
listen
to
no
other
friend
she
was
so
firm
and
fixed
in
this
that
he
did
not
even
dare
to
go
on
with
his
expostulation
but
afterwards
when
they
were
upstairs
together
bolton
spoke
out
more
at
length
and
with
more
energy
it
is
of
no
use
said
hester
ought
to
be
of
use
do
you
know
the
position
in
which
you
are
well
i
am
my
husband
wife
it
be
so
well
but
if
it
be
not
so
and
if
you
remain
with
him
while
there
is
a
doubt
upon
the
matter
then
you
are
his
mistress
i
am
not
his
wife
then
i
will
be
his
mistress
said
hester
standing
up
and
looking
as
she
spoke
much
as
her
mother
would
look
in
her
most
determined
moments
child
is
the
use
of
all
this
mamma
nothing
shall
make
me
leave
him
others
may
be
ashamed
of
me
but
because
of
this
i
shall
never
be
ashamed
of
myself
you
are
ashamed
of
me
you
could
mean
what
you
said
just
now
i
should
be
ashamed
of
you
do
mean
it
though
the
juries
and
the
judges
should
say
that
he
was
not
my
husband
though
all
the
judges
in
england
should
say
it
i
would
not
believe
them
they
may
put
him
in
prison
and
so
divide
us
but
they
never
shall
divide
my
bone
from
his
bone
and
my
flesh
from
his
flesh
as
you
are
ashamed
of
me
i
had
better
go
back
then
bolton
determined
that
early
in
the
morning
she
would
look
to
the
bolts
and
bars
but
when
the
morning
came
matters
had
softened
themselves
a
little
chapter
xxxii
the
babington
wedding
it
is
your
duty
especially
your
duty
to
separate
them
this
was
said
by
smirkie
the
vicar
of
to
bromley
the
rector
of
utterden
and
the
words
were
spoken
in
the
park
at
babington
where
the
two
clergymen
were
taking
a
walk
together
first
wife
had
been
a
miss
bromley
a
sister
of
the
clergyman
at
utterden
and
as
julia
babington
was
anxious
to
take
to
her
bosom
all
her
future
husband
past
belongings
bromley
had
been
invited
to
babington
it
might
be
that
aunt
polly
was
at
this
time
well
inclined
to
exercise
her
hospitality
in
this
direction
by
a
feeling
that
bromley
would
be
able
to
talk
to
them
about
this
terrible
affair
bromley
was
intimate
with
john
caldigate
and
of
course
would
know
all
about
it
there
was
naturally
in
aunt
polly
heart
a
certain
amount
of
at
the
way
in
which
things
were
going
smirkie
no
doubt
had
had
a
former
wife
but
no
one
would
call
him
a
bigamist
in
what
a
condition
might
her
poor
julia
have
been
but
for
that
interposition
of
providence
for
aunt
polly
regarded
poor
hester
bolton
as
having
been
quite
a
providential
incident
furnished
expressly
for
the
salvation
of
julia
hitherto
bromley
had
been
very
short
in
his
expressions
respecting
the
folking
tragedy
having
simply
declared
that
judging
by
character
he
could
not
conceive
that
a
man
such
as
caldigate
would
have
been
guilty
of
such
a
crime
but
now
he
was
being
put
through
his
facings
more
closely
by
his
should
i
want
to
separate
them
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
is
so
strong
is
for
a
jury
to
judge
and
if
a
jury
should
decide
that
there
had
been
no
australian
marriage
which
i
fear
we
can
hardly
hope
but
if
a
jury
were
to
decide
that
then
of
course
she
could
go
back
to
him
but
while
there
is
a
doubt
i
should
have
thought
tom
you
certainly
would
have
seen
it
even
though
you
never
have
had
a
wife
of
your
own
think
i
see
all
that
there
is
to
see
said
the
other
the
poor
lady
has
been
deceived
and
betrayed
no
punishment
can
be
too
heavy
for
the
man
who
has
so
injured
her
but
the
very
enormity
of
the
iniquity
makes
me
doubt
it
as
far
as
i
can
judge
caldigate
is
a
honest
gentleman
to
whom
the
perpetration
of
so
great
a
sin
would
hardly
suggest
itself
if
but
if
think
of
her
condition
tom
would
have
to
think
of
your
own
if
you
were
to
attempt
to
tell
her
to
leave
him
means
that
you
are
afraid
of
her
certainly
means
that
i
should
be
very
much
afraid
if
i
thought
of
taking
such
a
liberty
if
i
believed
it
to
be
my
duty
i
hope
that
i
would
do
it
are
her
clergyman
i
christened
her
child
i
preach
to
her
twice
every
sunday
and
if
she
were
to
die
i
should
bury
her
that
all
nearly
except
that
i
generally
dine
at
the
house
once
a
week
there
nothing
further
confided
to
you
than
that
she
were
to
come
to
me
for
advice
then
it
would
be
my
duty
to
give
her
what
advice
i
thought
to
be
best
and
then
then
i
should
have
to
make
up
my
mind
which
i
have
not
done
at
present
i
should
have
to
make
up
my
mind
not
as
to
his
guilt
for
i
believe
him
to
be
innocent
but
as
to
the
expediency
of
a
separation
till
a
jury
should
have
acquitted
him
but
i
am
well
aware
that
she
wo
come
to
me
and
from
little
words
which
constantly
drop
from
her
i
am
quite
sure
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
leave
her
husband
but
a
direct
command
from
himself
might
do
it
through
him
am
equally
sure
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
send
her
away
but
such
a
conviction
as
this
was
not
sufficient
for
smirkie
he
was
alive
to
the
fact
uncomfortably
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
ordinary
life
of
in
england
does
not
admit
of
direct
clerical
interference
as
a
country
clergyman
he
could
bestow
his
admonitions
upon
his
poorer
neighbours
but
upon
those
who
were
he
could
not
intrude
himself
unasked
unless
as
he
thought
in
cases
of
great
emergency
here
was
a
case
of
very
great
emergency
he
was
sure
that
he
would
have
courage
for
the
occasion
if
folking
were
within
the
bounds
of
it
was
just
the
case
in
which
counsel
should
be
volunteered
in
which
so
much
could
be
said
which
would
be
gross
impertinence
from
others
though
it
might
be
so
manifest
a
duty
to
a
clergyman
but
bromley
could
not
be
aroused
to
a
sense
either
of
his
duty
or
of
his
privileges
all
this
was
sad
to
smirkie
who
regretted
those
past
days
in
which
as
he
believed
the
delinquent
soul
had
been
as
manifestly
subject
to
ecclesiastical
interference
as
the
delinquent
body
has
always
been
to
the
civil
law
but
with
julia
who
was
to
be
his
wife
he
could
be
more
imperative
she
was
taught
to
give
thanks
before
the
throne
of
grace
because
she
had
been
spared
the
ignominy
of
being
married
to
a
man
who
could
not
have
made
her
his
wife
and
had
had
an
unstained
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
given
to
her
for
her
protection
for
with
that
candour
which
is
so
delightful
and
so
common
in
these
days
everything
had
been
told
to
smirkie
how
her
young
heart
had
for
a
time
turned
itself
towards
her
cousin
how
she
had
been
deceived
and
then
how
rejoiced
she
was
that
by
such
deceit
she
had
been
reserved
for
her
present
more
glorious
fate
wo
bromley
speak
to
her
julia
asked
is
a
very
difficult
question
a
very
difficult
question
indeed
said
smirkie
shaking
his
head
he
was
quite
sure
that
were
folking
in
his
parish
he
would
perform
the
duty
though
caldigate
and
the
unfortunate
lady
might
be
as
a
lion
and
a
lioness
in
opposition
to
him
but
he
was
also
of
opinion
that
sacerdotal
differences
of
opinion
should
not
be
discussed
among
laymen
should
not
be
discussed
by
a
clergyman
even
with
the
wife
of
his
bosom
at
babington
opinion
was
somewhat
divided
aunt
polly
and
julia
were
of
course
certain
that
john
caldigate
had
married
the
woman
in
australia
but
the
two
other
girls
and
their
father
were
not
at
all
so
sure
indeed
there
had
been
a
little
misunderstanding
among
the
babingtons
on
the
subject
which
was
perhaps
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
smirkie
had
more
endeared
himself
to
julia
mother
than
to
father
or
sisters
and
that
smirkie
himself
was
very
clear
as
to
the
criminality
of
the
bigamist
suppose
you
are
often
there
babington
said
to
his
guest
the
parson
of
utterden
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
them
you
think
it
possible
probable
said
the
clergyman
do
said
the
squire
suppose
he
was
a
little
wild
out
there
but
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
bigamy
young
men
when
they
get
out
to
those
places
are
not
quite
so
particular
as
they
ought
to
be
i
daresay
when
i
was
young
perhaps
i
was
not
as
steady
as
i
ought
to
have
been
but
by
george
here
is
a
man
comes
over
and
asks
for
a
lot
of
money
and
then
the
woman
asks
for
money
and
then
they
say
that
if
they
do
get
it
they
swear
the
fellow
was
married
in
australia
i
ca
fancy
that
any
jury
will
believe
that
hope
not
yet
madame
the
squire
was
in
the
habit
of
calling
his
wife
madame
when
he
intended
to
insinuate
anything
against
her
got
it
settled
in
her
head
that
this
young
woman
is
his
wife
at
all
i
think
it
uncommon
hard
a
man
ought
to
be
considered
innocent
till
he
has
been
found
guilty
i
shall
go
over
and
see
him
one
of
these
days
and
say
a
kind
word
to
her
there
was
at
that
moment
some
little
difference
of
opinion
which
was
coming
to
a
head
in
reference
to
a
very
delicate
matter
when
the
conversations
above
related
took
place
the
babington
wedding
had
been
fixed
to
take
place
in
a
week
time
should
cousin
john
be
invited
or
should
he
not
julia
was
decidedly
against
it
did
not
think
she
said
she
could
stand
up
at
the
altar
and
conduct
herself
on
an
occasion
so
trying
if
she
were
aware
that
he
were
standing
by
her
smirkie
of
course
was
not
asked
was
not
directly
asked
but
equally
of
course
he
was
able
to
convey
his
own
opinion
through
his
future
bride
aunt
polly
thought
that
the
county
would
be
shocked
if
a
man
charged
with
bigamy
was
allowed
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
but
the
squire
was
a
man
who
could
have
an
opinion
of
his
own
and
after
having
elicited
that
of
bromley
insisted
that
the
invitation
should
be
sent
will
be
a
pollution
said
julia
sternly
to
her
younger
sisters
will
be
a
married
woman
almost
before
you
have
seen
him
said
georgiana
the
second
so
it
wo
matter
so
much
to
you
we
must
get
over
it
as
we
can
julia
had
been
thought
by
her
sisters
not
to
bear
the
smirkie
triumph
with
sufficient
humility
and
they
therefore
were
sometimes
a
little
harsh
to
her
do
think
you
understand
it
at
all
said
julia
have
no
conception
what
should
be
the
feelings
of
a
married
woman
especially
when
she
is
going
to
become
the
wife
of
one
of
ministers
but
in
spite
of
all
this
aunt
polly
wrote
to
her
nephew
as
follows
john
our
dearest
julia
is
to
be
married
on
tuesday
next
you
know
how
anxious
we
all
have
been
to
maintain
affectionate
family
relations
with
you
and
we
therefore
do
not
like
the
idea
of
our
sweet
child
passing
from
her
present
sphere
to
other
duties
without
your
presence
will
you
come
over
on
monday
evening
and
stay
till
after
the
breakfast
it
is
astonishing
how
many
of
our
friends
from
the
two
counties
have
expressed
their
wish
to
grace
the
ceremony
by
their
company
i
doubt
whether
there
is
a
clergyman
in
the
diocese
of
ely
more
respected
and
thought
of
by
all
the
upper
classes
than
augustus
smirkie
do
not
ask
caldigate
because
under
present
circumstances
she
would
not
perhaps
wish
to
go
into
company
and
because
augustus
has
never
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
making
her
acquaintance
i
will
only
say
that
it
is
the
anxious
wish
of
us
all
here
that
you
and
she
together
may
soon
see
the
end
of
these
terrible
believe
me
to
be
your
affectionate
aunt
babington
the
writing
of
this
letter
had
not
been
effected
without
much
difficulty
the
squire
himself
was
not
good
at
the
writing
of
letters
and
though
he
did
insist
on
seeing
this
epistle
so
that
he
might
be
satisfied
that
caldigate
had
been
asked
in
good
faith
he
did
not
know
how
to
propose
alterations
all
my
eye
he
said
referring
to
his
that
was
to
be
as
good
as
another
but
i
know
that
he
any
better
my
dear
said
aunt
polly
because
you
do
not
interest
yourself
about
such
matters
if
you
had
heard
what
the
archdeacon
said
of
him
the
other
day
you
would
think
differently
another
parson
said
the
squire
course
they
butter
each
other
up
then
he
went
on
to
the
other
paragraph
would
have
said
anything
about
his
wife
would
not
have
been
civil
said
aunt
polly
as
you
insist
on
my
asking
him
i
do
not
wish
to
be
rude
and
so
the
letter
was
sent
as
it
was
written
it
reached
caldigate
on
the
day
which
hester
was
passing
with
her
mother
at
chesterton
on
the
tuesday
she
had
left
folking
on
the
monday
intending
to
return
on
the
wednesday
caldigate
was
therefore
alone
with
his
father
might
as
well
have
left
that
undone
said
he
throwing
the
letter
over
the
table
about
the
silliest
letter
i
ever
read
said
the
old
squire
it
is
intended
for
civility
she
means
to
show
that
she
does
not
condemn
you
there
are
many
people
who
do
not
know
when
to
speak
and
when
to
be
silent
i
should
go
i
sha
go
i
should
take
it
as
meant
in
kindness
then
john
caldigate
wrote
back
as
follows
this
that
has
befallen
my
wife
and
me
prevents
us
from
going
anywhere
she
is
at
the
present
moment
with
her
own
people
at
chesterton
but
when
she
returns
i
shall
not
leave
her
give
my
kindest
love
to
julia
and
ask
her
from
me
to
accept
the
little
present
which
i
send
her
julia
declared
that
she
would
much
rather
not
have
accepted
the
brooch
and
that
she
would
never
wear
it
but
animosity
against
such
articles
wears
itself
out
quickly
and
it
may
be
expected
that
the
little
ornament
will
be
seen
in
the
houses
of
the
suffolk
gentry
among
whom
smirkie
is
so
popular
whether
it
was
smirkie
popularity
or
the
general
estimation
in
which
the
babington
family
were
held
or
the
delight
which
is
taken
by
the
world
at
large
in
weddings
there
was
a
very
great
gathering
at
babington
church
and
in
the
squire
house
afterwards
though
it
was
early
in
march
a
time
of
the
year
which
in
the
eastern
counties
of
england
is
not
altogether
propitious
to
festivity
though
the
roads
were
muddy
and
the
park
sloppy
and
the
church
abominably
open
to
draughts
still
there
was
a
crowd
the
young
ladies
in
that
part
of
the
world
had
been
slow
in
marrying
lately
and
it
was
felt
that
the
present
occasion
might
give
a
little
fillip
to
the
neighbourhood
this
was
the
second
suffolk
young
lady
that
smirkie
had
married
and
he
was
therefore
entitled
to
popularity
he
certainly
had
done
as
much
as
he
could
and
there
was
probably
no
one
around
who
had
done
more
think
the
dear
child
will
be
happy
said
babington
to
her
old
friend
munday
the
wife
of
archdeacon
munday
the
clerical
dignitary
who
had
given
smirkie
so
good
a
character
course
she
will
said
munday
who
had
already
given
three
daughters
in
marriage
to
three
clergymen
and
who
had
as
it
were
become
used
to
the
transfer
that
she
will
do
her
duty
in
it
not
there
nothing
difficult
in
it
if
she
only
sees
that
he
has
his
surplice
and
bands
properly
got
up
he
is
not
on
the
whole
a
man
and
though
the
children
are
rough
they
grow
out
of
that
and
she
ought
to
make
him
take
two
or
perhaps
three
glasses
of
port
wine
on
sundays
smirkie
is
not
as
young
as
he
used
to
be
and
two
whole
duties
with
the
sunday
school
which
must
be
looked
into
do
take
a
good
deal
out
of
a
man
the
archdeacon
of
course
has
a
curate
but
i
suppose
smirkie
could
hardly
manage
that
just
at
present
the
views
which
had
hitherto
been
taken
at
babington
of
the
future
life
had
been
somewhat
loftier
than
this
the
bands
and
the
surplice
and
the
port
wine
seemed
to
be
small
after
all
that
had
been
said
the
mother
felt
that
she
was
in
some
degree
rebuked
not
having
yet
learned
that
nothing
will
so
much
lessen
the
enthusiasm
one
may
feel
for
the
work
of
a
barrister
or
a
member
of
parliament
or
a
clergyman
as
a
little
domestic
conversation
with
the
wife
of
the
one
or
the
other
but
munday
was
a
lady
possessing
much
clerical
authority
and
that
which
she
said
had
to
be
endured
with
equanimity
smirkie
seemed
to
enjoy
the
occasion
and
held
his
own
through
the
day
with
much
dignity
the
archdeacon
and
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
and
bromley
all
assisted
and
nothing
was
wanting
of
outward
ceremony
which
a
small
country
church
could
supply
when
his
health
was
drunk
at
the
breakfast
he
preached
quite
a
little
sermon
as
he
returned
thanks
holding
his
bride
hands
in
his
the
while
performing
his
part
in
the
scene
in
a
manner
which
no
one
else
would
have
dared
to
attempt
then
there
was
the
parting
between
the
mother
and
daughter
upstairs
before
she
was
taken
away
for
her
ten
days
to
brighton
darling
it
is
not
so
far
but
that
i
can
come
and
see
you
very
often
do
mamma
i
think
i
can
help
you
with
the
children
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
them
mamma
i
intend
to
have
my
way
with
them
and
that
will
be
everything
i
do
mean
to
be
weak
of
course
augustus
will
do
what
he
thinks
best
in
the
parish
but
he
quite
understands
that
i
am
to
be
mistress
at
home
as
for
munday
mamma
i
do
suppose
that
she
knows
everything
i
believe
i
can
manage
quite
as
well
as
mrs
munday
then
there
was
a
parting
joint
congratulation
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
the
allurements
of
her
cousin
john
caldigate
no
mamma
that
would
never
have
done
where
you
might
have
been
now
am
sure
i
should
have
found
out
his
character
in
time
and
have
broken
from
him
let
it
have
cost
what
it
might
a
man
that
can
do
such
things
as
that
is
to
me
quite
horrible
what
is
to
become
of
her
and
her
baby
and
perhaps
two
she
added
in
a
whisper
holding
up
her
hands
and
shaking
her
head
the
ceremony
through
which
she
had
just
passed
had
given
her
courage
to
hint
at
such
a
possibility
suppose
she
have
to
be
called
miss
bolton
again
of
course
there
was
some
triumph
in
the
bosom
of
the
undoubted
augustus
smirkie
as
she
remembered
what
her
own
fate
might
have
been
then
she
was
carried
away
in
the
family
carriage
amidst
a
deluge
of
rice
and
a
shower
of
old
shoes
that
same
night
bromley
gave
an
account
of
the
wedding
to
john
caldigate
at
folking
telling
him
how
well
all
the
personages
had
performed
their
parts
julia
she
at
any
rate
will
be
safe
enough
i
should
think
said
the
clergyman
i
mean
is
that
she
has
no
dangers
to
fear
such
as
my
poor
wife
has
encountered
whomever
i
think
of
now
i
can
not
but
compare
them
to
ourselves
no
woman
surely
was
ever
so
as
she
and
no
man
ever
so
unfortunate
as
myself
will
be
all
over
in
august
where
shall
i
be
my
own
lawyer
tells
me
that
it
is
too
probable
that
i
shall
be
in
prison
and
where
will
she
be
then
chapter
xxxiii
persuasion
early
on
the
tuesday
morning
hester
came
down
into
the
breakfast
parlour
at
puritan
grange
having
with
difficulty
persuaded
herself
that
she
would
stay
the
appointed
hours
in
her
mother
house
on
the
previous
evening
her
mother
had
she
thought
been
very
hard
on
her
and
she
had
determined
to
go
she
would
not
stay
even
with
her
mother
if
her
mother
insisted
upon
telling
her
that
she
was
not
her
husband
wife
but
during
the
night
she
was
able
to
persuade
herself
to
bear
what
had
been
already
said
to
let
it
be
as
though
it
had
been
forgotten
her
mother
was
her
mother
but
she
would
bear
no
more
as
to
herself
and
her
own
conduct
her
parents
might
say
what
they
pleased
to
her
but
of
her
husband
she
would
endure
to
hear
no
evil
word
spoken
in
this
spirit
she
came
down
into
the
little
parlour
bolton
was
also
up
had
been
up
and
about
for
some
time
previous
she
was
a
woman
who
never
gave
way
to
temptations
of
ease
a
nasty
dark
morning
at
six
with
just
light
enough
to
enable
her
to
dress
without
a
candle
with
no
fire
and
no
hot
water
with
her
husband
snoring
while
she
went
through
her
operations
was
to
her
thinking
the
proper
condition
of
things
for
this
world
not
to
be
cold
not
to
be
uncomfortable
not
to
strike
her
toes
against
the
furniture
because
she
could
not
quite
see
what
she
was
about
would
to
her
have
been
to
be
wicked
when
her
daughter
came
into
the
parlour
she
had
been
about
the
house
for
more
than
an
hour
and
had
had
a
conference
both
with
the
cook
and
with
the
gardener
the
cook
was
of
opinion
that
not
a
word
should
be
said
or
an
unusual
bolt
drawn
or
a
thing
removed
till
the
wednesday
ca
carry
down
her
big
box
herself
and
the
likes
of
miss
hester
would
never
think
of
going
without
her
things
and
then
the
baby
a
look
of
agony
came
across
the
mother
face
as
she
heard
her
daughter
called
miss
hester
but
in
truth
the
woman
had
used
the
name
from
old
association
and
not
with
any
reference
to
her
late
young
mistress
present
position
should
just
tell
her
flat
on
wednesday
morning
that
she
was
to
stir
out
of
this
but
i
would
say
nothing
at
all
about
any
of
it
till
then
the
gardener
winked
and
nodded
his
head
and
promised
to
put
a
stake
into
the
ground
behind
the
little
which
would
make
the
opening
of
it
impossible
take
my
word
for
it
she
never
try
that
she
be
a
deal
too
proud
she
rampage
at
the
front
door
and
despise
any
escaping
like
that
was
the
gardener
idea
and
the
gardener
had
long
known
the
young
lady
by
these
arguments
bolton
was
induced
to
postpone
her
prison
arrangements
till
the
morrow
when
she
found
her
daughter
in
the
small
parlour
she
had
settled
much
in
her
mind
during
the
early
morning
that
is
till
bolton
should
have
gone
into
cambridge
not
a
word
should
be
said
about
the
marriage
then
when
they
two
would
be
alone
together
another
attempt
should
be
made
to
persuade
hester
to
come
and
live
at
chesterton
till
after
the
trial
but
even
in
making
that
attempt
no
opinion
should
be
expressed
as
to
john
caldigate
wickedness
and
no
hint
should
be
given
as
to
the
coming
incarceration
you
bring
baby
down
with
you
the
grandmother
asked
no
baby
had
been
awake
ever
so
long
and
then
had
gone
to
sleep
again
and
the
nurse
was
now
with
him
to
protect
him
from
the
sufferings
incident
to
waking
papa
will
be
down
soon
and
then
we
will
have
breakfast
said
bolton
after
that
there
was
silence
between
them
for
some
time
a
bond
of
discord
if
the
phrase
may
be
allowed
is
often
quite
as
strong
as
any
bond
coming
from
concord
and
agreement
there
was
to
both
these
women
a
subject
of
such
paramount
importance
to
each
that
none
other
could
furnish
matter
of
natural
conversation
the
one
was
saying
to
herself
ever
and
always
is
my
husband
let
the
outside
world
say
what
it
may
he
is
my
husband
but
the
other
was
as
constantly
denying
to
herself
this
assertion
and
saying
is
not
her
husband
certainly
he
is
not
her
husband
and
as
to
the
one
the
possession
of
that
which
she
claimed
was
all
the
world
and
as
to
the
other
the
idea
of
the
possession
without
true
possession
entailed
upon
her
child
pollution
crime
and
ignominy
it
was
impossible
but
that
the
mind
of
each
should
be
too
full
to
admit
of
aught
but
forced
expressions
on
other
matters
it
was
in
vain
for
them
to
attempt
to
talk
of
the
garden
the
house
the
church
or
of
the
old
man
health
it
was
in
vain
even
to
attempt
to
talk
of
the
baby
there
are
people
who
however
full
their
hearts
may
be
full
of
anger
or
full
of
joy
can
keep
the
fulness
in
abeyance
till
a
chosen
time
for
exhibiting
it
shall
come
but
neither
of
these
two
was
such
a
person
every
stiff
plait
in
the
elder
woman
muslin
and
crape
declared
her
conviction
that
john
caldigate
was
not
legally
married
to
her
daughter
every
glance
of
hester
eye
every
motion
made
with
her
hands
every
little
shake
of
her
head
declared
her
purpose
of
fighting
for
that
one
fact
whatever
might
be
the
odds
against
her
when
the
banker
came
down
to
breakfast
things
were
better
for
a
little
time
the
pouring
out
of
his
tea
mitigated
somewhat
the
starchiness
of
his
wife
severity
and
hester
when
cutting
the
loaf
for
him
could
seem
to
take
an
interest
in
performing
an
old
duty
he
said
not
a
word
against
caldigate
and
when
he
went
out
hester
as
had
been
her
custom
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
course
you
will
be
here
when
i
come
he
said
yes
i
do
not
go
home
till
then
she
parted
from
him
and
spent
the
next
hour
or
two
with
her
baby
i
come
in
said
the
mother
knocking
at
the
door
yes
mamma
do
you
think
baby
is
very
like
his
father
dare
say
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
good
at
tracing
likenesses
he
certainly
is
like
you
much
more
like
his
father
said
hester
after
that
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
mother
commenced
her
task
in
her
most
serious
voice
my
child
you
can
understand
that
a
duty
may
become
so
imperious
that
it
must
be
performed
said
hester
pressing
her
lips
close
together
can
understand
that
there
might
be
a
duty
very
necessary
for
her
to
perform
though
in
the
performance
of
it
she
should
be
driven
to
quarrel
absolutely
with
her
own
mother
it
is
with
me
whom
do
you
think
i
love
best
in
all
the
world
do
love
your
father
dearly
and
i
endeavour
by
god
grace
to
do
my
duty
by
him
though
i
fear
it
is
done
imperfectly
but
my
child
our
hearts
i
think
yearn
more
to
those
who
are
younger
than
ourselves
than
to
our
elders
we
love
best
those
whom
we
have
cherished
and
protected
and
whom
we
may
perhaps
still
cherish
and
protect
when
i
try
to
tear
my
heart
away
from
the
things
of
this
vile
world
it
clings
to
you
to
you
to
you
of
course
this
could
not
be
borne
without
an
embrace
mamma
hester
exclaimed
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
mother
lap
you
suffer
must
not
i
suffer
if
you
rejoice
would
i
not
fain
rejoice
with
you
if
i
could
did
i
not
bring
you
into
the
world
my
only
one
and
nursed
you
and
prayed
for
you
and
watched
you
with
all
a
mother
care
as
you
grew
up
among
the
troubles
of
the
world
have
you
not
known
that
my
heart
has
been
too
soft
towards
you
even
for
the
due
performance
of
my
duties
have
always
been
good
to
me
mamma
am
i
altered
now
do
you
think
that
a
mother
heart
can
be
changed
to
her
only
child
mamma
hester
that
i
think
is
impossible
though
for
the
last
twelve
months
i
have
not
seen
you
day
by
day
though
i
have
not
prepared
the
food
which
you
eat
and
the
clothes
which
you
wear
as
i
used
to
do
you
have
been
as
constantly
in
my
mind
you
are
still
my
child
my
only
child
i
know
you
love
me
so
love
you
as
to
know
that
i
sin
in
so
loving
aught
that
is
human
and
so
loving
you
must
i
not
do
my
duty
by
you
when
love
and
duty
both
compel
me
to
speak
how
shall
i
be
silent
have
said
it
mamma
said
hester
slowly
drawing
herself
up
from
off
the
ground
is
saying
it
once
enough
when
as
i
think
the
very
soul
the
immortal
soul
of
her
who
is
of
all
the
dearest
to
me
depends
on
what
i
may
say
may
be
saved
or
oh
perhaps
lost
for
ever
by
the
manner
in
which
i
may
say
it
how
am
i
not
to
speak
when
such
thoughts
as
these
are
heavy
within
me
is
it
you
would
say
this
hester
asked
with
a
low
hoarse
voice
and
a
stern
look
as
though
she
could
not
resist
her
mother
prayer
for
the
privilege
of
speaking
but
at
the
same
time
was
resolutely
prepared
not
to
be
turned
a
by
anything
that
might
be
said
a
word
about
him
mamma
no
unless
you
can
tell
me
that
you
will
love
him
as
your
a
word
about
him
she
repeated
in
a
harsher
voice
she
felt
that
that
promise
should
have
been
enough
and
that
in
the
present
circumstances
she
should
not
have
been
invited
to
love
the
man
she
hated
father
and
i
wish
you
for
the
next
few
months
to
come
and
live
with
us
is
quite
impossible
said
hester
standing
very
upright
with
a
face
altogether
unlike
that
she
had
worn
when
kneeling
at
her
knees
should
listen
to
me
i
will
listen
will
be
a
trial
john
at
least
seems
to
think
so
it
is
possible
that
these
wicked
people
may
give
it
up
or
that
they
may
have
no
money
to
go
on
but
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
trial
woman
has
bound
herself
to
prosecute
him
she
wants
to
get
money
but
we
need
not
discuss
that
mamma
john
thinks
that
there
will
be
a
trial
that
is
over
will
you
not
be
better
away
from
him
how
will
it
be
with
you
if
it
should
be
decided
that
he
is
not
your
husband
here
hester
of
course
prepared
herself
for
interruption
but
her
mother
prayed
for
permission
to
continue
to
me
for
one
moment
hester
well
mamma
go
on
would
it
be
with
you
in
that
case
you
must
be
separated
then
as
that
is
possible
is
it
not
right
that
you
should
obey
the
ordinances
of
god
and
man
and
keep
yourself
apart
till
they
who
are
in
authority
shall
have
spoken
are
no
such
ordinances
are
indeed
if
you
were
to
ask
all
your
friends
all
the
married
women
in
cambridgeshire
what
would
they
say
would
they
not
all
tell
you
that
no
woman
should
live
with
a
man
while
there
is
a
shadow
of
doubt
and
as
to
the
law
of
god
you
know
god
law
and
can
only
defend
yourself
by
your
own
certainty
as
to
a
matter
respecting
which
all
others
are
uncertain
you
think
yourself
certain
because
such
certainty
is
a
way
to
yourself
out
of
your
present
misery
is
for
my
child
she
shouted
for
him
for
your
babe
your
darling
babe
whether
he
be
yours
in
joy
of
heart
or
in
agony
of
spirit
he
is
still
yours
no
one
will
rob
you
of
him
if
it
be
as
we
fear
would
not
i
help
you
to
love
him
help
you
to
care
for
him
help
you
to
pray
for
him
if
it
were
so
would
i
desert
him
or
you
because
in
your
innocence
you
had
been
betrayed
into
misfortune
do
i
not
feel
for
your
child
but
when
he
grows
up
and
is
a
man
and
will
have
learned
the
facts
of
his
early
years
let
him
be
able
to
tell
himself
that
his
mother
though
unfortunate
was
pure
am
pure
she
said
child
my
own
one
can
i
your
mother
think
aught
else
of
you
do
i
not
know
your
heart
do
not
i
know
the
very
thoughts
within
you
am
pure
he
has
become
my
husband
and
nothing
can
divide
us
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
another
man
i
never
had
the
faintest
liking
as
do
other
girls
when
he
came
and
told
me
that
he
had
seen
me
and
loved
me
and
would
take
me
for
his
wife
i
felt
at
once
that
i
was
all
his
his
to
do
as
he
liked
with
me
his
to
nourish
him
his
to
worship
him
his
to
obey
him
his
to
love
him
let
father
or
mother
or
all
the
world
say
what
they
would
to
the
contrary
then
we
were
married
till
he
was
my
own
i
never
even
pressed
my
lips
upon
his
but
i
became
his
wife
by
a
bond
that
nothing
shall
break
you
tell
me
of
god
law
by
god
law
i
am
his
wife
let
the
people
say
what
they
will
i
have
but
two
to
think
of
and
him
asked
her
mother
have
three
to
think
of
god
and
him
and
my
child
and
may
god
be
good
to
me
and
them
as
in
this
matter
i
will
put
myself
away
from
myself
altogether
it
is
for
me
to
obey
him
and
i
will
submit
myself
to
none
other
if
he
bids
me
go
i
will
go
if
he
bids
me
stay
here
i
will
stay
i
have
become
his
so
entirely
that
no
judges
no
judges
can
divide
us
judges
i
know
but
one
judge
and
he
is
there
and
he
has
said
that
those
whom
he
has
joined
together
man
shall
not
put
asunder
pure
pure
no
one
should
praise
herself
but
as
a
woman
i
do
know
that
i
am
pure
then
the
mother
heart
yearned
greatly
towards
her
daughter
and
yet
she
was
no
whit
changed
she
knew
nothing
of
phrases
of
logic
but
she
felt
that
hester
had
begged
the
whole
question
those
whom
god
had
joined
together
true
true
if
only
one
could
know
whether
in
this
or
the
other
case
god
had
joined
the
couple
as
hester
argued
the
matter
no
woman
should
be
taken
from
the
man
she
had
married
though
he
might
have
a
dozen
other
wives
all
living
and
she
spoke
of
purity
as
though
it
were
a
virtue
which
could
be
created
and
consecrated
simply
by
the
action
of
her
own
heart
as
though
nothing
outside
no
ceremony
no
ordinance
could
affect
it
the
same
argument
would
enable
her
to
live
with
john
caldigate
after
he
should
come
out
of
prison
even
though
as
would
then
be
the
case
another
woman
would
have
the
legal
right
of
calling
herself
john
caldigate
on
the
previous
day
she
had
declared
that
if
she
could
not
be
his
wife
she
would
be
his
mistress
the
mother
knew
what
she
meant
that
let
people
call
her
by
what
name
they
might
she
would
still
be
her
husband
wife
in
the
eye
of
god
but
she
would
not
be
so
and
then
she
would
not
be
pure
and
to
bolton
the
worst
of
it
was
that
this
cloudiness
had
come
upon
her
daughter
this
incapacity
to
reason
it
out
because
the
love
of
a
human
being
had
become
so
strong
within
her
bosom
as
to
have
superseded
and
choked
the
love
of
heavenly
things
but
how
should
she
explain
all
this
am
not
asking
you
to
drop
his
name
his
name
i
will
never
drop
it
i
can
not
drop
it
it
is
mine
i
could
not
make
myself
anything
but
john
caldigate
if
i
would
and
he
she
said
taking
the
baby
up
from
its
cradle
and
pressing
it
to
her
bosom
shall
be
daniel
caldigate
to
the
day
of
his
death
do
you
think
that
i
will
take
a
step
that
shall
look
like
robbing
my
child
of
his
honest
name
that
will
seem
to
imply
a
doubt
that
he
is
not
his
own
father
honest
boy
that
he
is
not
a
fitting
heir
to
the
property
which
his
forefathers
have
owned
so
long
never
they
may
call
me
what
name
they
will
but
i
will
call
myself
john
caldigate
wife
as
long
as
i
have
a
voice
to
make
myself
heard
it
was
the
same
protest
over
and
over
again
and
it
was
vain
to
answer
will
not
stay
under
your
father
roof
i
have
to
live
under
my
husband
roof
then
bolton
left
the
room
apparently
in
anger
though
her
heart
within
might
be
melting
with
ruth
still
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
assume
a
look
of
anger
on
the
morrow
she
would
have
to
show
herself
angry
with
a
vengeance
if
she
should
then
still
be
determined
to
carry
out
her
plan
and
she
thought
that
she
was
determined
what
had
pity
to
do
with
it
or
love
or
moving
words
were
not
all
these
things
temptation
from
the
evil
one
if
they
were
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
strict
line
of
hard
duty
when
she
left
the
room
where
the
young
mother
was
still
standing
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
she
doubted
for
some
minutes
perhaps
for
some
then
she
wrestled
with
those
emanations
from
the
evil
one
with
pity
with
love
and
suasive
tenderness
and
at
last
overcame
them
know
i
am
pure
the
daughter
had
said
know
i
am
right
said
the
mother
but
she
spoke
a
word
to
her
husband
when
he
came
home
can
not
bend
her
i
can
not
turn
her
in
the
least
will
not
stay
of
her
own
accord
have
told
her
no
not
till
ought
to
stay
certainly
said
the
father
there
had
been
very
little
intercourse
between
the
mother
and
daughter
during
the
afternoon
and
while
the
three
were
sitting
together
nothing
was
said
about
the
morrow
the
evening
would
have
seemed
to
be
very
sad
and
very
silent
had
they
not
all
three
been
used
to
so
many
silent
evenings
in
that
room
hester
during
her
wedding
tour
and
the
few
weeks
of
her
happiness
at
folking
before
the
trouble
had
come
had
felt
a
new
life
and
almost
an
ecstasy
of
joy
in
the
thorough
liveliness
of
her
husband
but
the
days
of
her
old
home
were
not
so
long
ago
that
its
old
manners
should
seem
strange
to
her
she
therefore
sat
out
the
hours
patiently
stitching
some
baby
ornament
till
her
mother
told
her
that
the
time
for
prayer
had
come
after
worship
her
father
called
her
out
into
the
hall
as
he
went
up
to
his
room
he
said
is
not
right
that
you
should
leave
us
must
papa
tell
you
that
it
is
not
right
you
have
a
home
in
which
everybody
will
respect
you
for
the
present
you
should
remain
here
can
not
papa
he
told
me
to
go
back
i
would
not
disobey
him
now
not
now
were
it
ever
so
then
the
old
man
paused
as
though
he
were
going
on
with
the
argument
but
finding
that
he
had
said
all
that
he
had
to
say
he
slowly
made
his
way
upstairs
mamma
said
hester
returning
only
to
the
door
of
the
my
love
as
the
words
were
spoken
they
both
felt
that
there
was
something
wrong
much
that
was
wrong
do
not
think
they
will
do
that
said
hester
to
herself
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
to
her
chamber
chapter
xxxiv
violence
it
had
been
arranged
at
folking
before
hester
had
started
that
caldigate
himself
should
drive
the
waggonette
into
cambridge
to
take
her
back
on
the
wednesday
but
that
he
would
bring
a
servant
with
him
who
should
drive
the
carriage
up
to
the
grange
so
that
he
personally
should
not
have
to
appear
at
the
door
of
the
house
he
would
remain
at
seely
and
then
the
waggonette
should
pick
him
up
this
had
been
explained
to
bolton
will
remain
in
town
because
he
has
so
much
to
do
with
seely
hester
had
said
richard
will
call
here
at
about
twelve
all
her
plans
had
thus
been
made
known
and
bolton
was
aware
at
what
hour
the
bolts
must
be
drawn
and
the
things
removed
but
as
the
time
drew
nearer
her
dislike
to
a
sudden
commencement
of
absolute
hostilities
became
stronger
to
hostilities
which
would
seem
to
have
no
sanction
from
bolton
himself
because
he
would
then
be
absent
and
he
too
though
as
he
lay
awake
through
the
dreary
hours
of
the
long
night
he
said
no
word
about
the
plan
felt
and
felt
more
strongly
as
the
dawn
was
breaking
that
it
would
be
mean
to
leave
his
daughter
with
a
farewell
kiss
knowing
as
he
would
do
that
he
was
leaving
her
within
leaving
her
to
the
charge
of
jailers
the
farewell
kiss
would
be
given
as
though
he
and
she
were
to
meet
no
more
in
her
old
home
till
this
terrible
trial
should
be
over
and
some
word
appropriate
to
such
a
parting
would
then
be
spoken
but
any
such
parting
word
would
be
false
and
the
falsehood
would
be
against
his
own
child
she
expect
it
he
said
in
a
low
voice
when
his
wife
came
up
to
him
as
he
was
dressing
expects
nothing
i
am
thinking
that
perhaps
you
would
tell
her
that
she
could
not
go
could
not
say
if
i
tell
her
anything
i
must
tell
her
all
not
that
be
best
then
the
old
man
thought
it
all
over
it
would
be
very
much
the
best
for
him
not
to
say
anything
about
it
if
he
could
reconcile
it
to
his
conscience
to
leave
the
house
without
doing
so
and
he
knew
well
that
his
wife
was
more
powerful
than
he
gifted
with
greater
persistence
more
capable
of
enduring
a
shower
of
tears
or
a
storm
of
anger
the
success
of
the
plan
would
be
more
probable
if
the
conduct
of
it
were
left
entirely
to
his
wife
but
his
conscience
was
sore
within
him
will
come
with
me
to
the
gate
he
said
to
his
daughter
after
their
silent
breakfast
yes
to
say
then
he
took
his
hat
and
his
gloves
and
his
umbrella
very
slowly
lingering
in
the
hall
as
he
did
so
while
his
wife
kept
her
seat
firm
and
square
at
the
breakfast
table
hester
had
her
hat
and
shawl
with
her
but
bolton
did
not
suspect
that
she
would
endeavour
to
escape
now
without
returning
for
her
child
therefore
she
sat
firm
and
square
waiting
to
hear
from
hester
herself
what
her
father
might
bring
himself
to
communicate
to
her
he
said
as
he
slowly
walked
round
the
sweep
in
front
of
the
house
he
said
would
do
your
duty
best
to
god
and
man
best
to
john
caldigate
and
to
your
child
by
remaining
here
can
i
unless
he
tells
me
have
your
father
authority
surrendered
it
when
you
gave
me
to
him
as
his
wife
it
is
not
that
i
would
rebel
against
you
papa
but
that
i
must
obey
him
does
not
paul
say
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
and
you
can
not
suppose
that
in
any
ordinary
case
i
would
interfere
between
you
and
him
it
is
not
that
i
am
anxious
to
take
anything
from
him
that
belongs
to
him
then
as
they
were
approaching
the
gate
he
stood
still
now
in
such
an
emergency
as
this
when
a
question
has
risen
as
to
his
power
of
making
you
his
wife
will
not
hear
of
that
i
am
his
wife
it
may
become
my
duty
and
your
mother
to
to
to
provide
you
with
a
home
till
the
law
shall
have
decided
can
not
leave
his
home
unless
he
bids
me
am
telling
you
of
my
duty
of
my
duty
and
your
mother
then
he
passed
out
through
the
gate
thus
having
saved
his
conscience
from
the
shame
of
a
false
farewell
and
she
slowly
made
her
way
back
to
the
house
after
standing
for
a
moment
to
look
after
him
as
he
went
she
was
almost
sure
now
that
something
was
intended
he
would
not
have
spoken
in
that
way
of
his
duty
unless
he
had
meant
her
to
suppose
that
he
intended
to
perform
it
duty
he
had
said
duty
and
your
mother
of
course
something
was
intended
something
was
to
be
done
or
said
more
than
had
been
done
or
said
already
during
the
breakfast
she
had
seen
in
the
curves
of
her
mother
mouth
the
signs
of
some
resolute
purpose
during
the
very
prayers
she
had
heard
in
her
mother
voice
a
sound
as
of
a
settled
determination
she
knew
she
knew
that
something
was
to
be
done
and
with
that
knowledge
she
went
back
into
her
mother
room
and
sat
herself
down
firmly
and
squarely
at
the
table
she
had
left
her
cup
partly
full
and
began
again
to
drink
her
tea
did
your
papa
say
to
you
asked
her
mother
bade
me
stay
here
but
i
told
him
that
most
certainly
i
should
go
home
to
folking
then
bolton
also
became
aware
of
fixed
will
and
resolute
purpose
on
her
daughter
part
his
word
go
for
nothing
can
two
persons
words
go
for
anything
when
obedience
is
concerned
it
is
like
god
and
mammon
two
people
tell
one
differently
it
must
be
right
to
cling
to
one
and
leave
the
other
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
i
have
got
to
obey
my
husband
even
were
i
to
say
that
i
would
stay
he
could
come
and
take
me
away
could
not
do
that
shall
not
be
so
disobedient
as
to
make
it
necessary
the
carriage
will
be
here
at
twelve
and
i
shall
go
i
had
better
go
and
help
nurse
to
put
the
things
up
so
saying
she
left
the
room
but
bolton
remained
there
a
while
sitting
square
and
firm
at
the
table
it
was
not
yet
ten
when
she
slowly
followed
her
daughter
she
first
went
into
her
own
room
for
a
moment
to
collect
her
thoughts
over
again
and
then
she
walked
across
the
passage
to
her
daughter
chamber
she
knocked
at
the
door
but
entered
as
she
knocked
she
said
you
go
into
my
room
for
a
minute
or
two
i
wish
to
speak
to
your
mistress
may
she
take
the
baby
hester
the
baby
was
taken
and
then
the
two
were
alone
not
pack
up
your
things
hester
not
are
not
going
am
going
mamma
i
should
seem
to
be
cruel
to
you
only
seem
cuts
me
to
the
heart
but
you
can
not
go
back
to
folking
am
i
to
go
hester
me
what
you
mean
mamma
is
it
that
i
am
to
be
a
prisoner
you
would
be
gentle
i
would
explain
it
will
not
be
gentle
you
mean
to
keep
me
by
violence
but
i
mean
to
go
my
husband
will
come
i
will
not
be
kept
oh
mamma
you
would
not
desire
me
to
quarrel
with
you
openly
before
the
servants
before
all
the
world
i
will
not
be
kept
i
will
certainly
go
back
to
folking
would
i
not
go
back
though
i
had
to
get
through
the
windows
to
walk
the
whole
way
to
call
upon
the
policemen
even
to
help
me
one
will
help
you
hester
every
one
will
know
that
for
the
present
this
should
be
your
home
never
shall
be
my
home
again
said
hester
bursting
into
tears
and
rushing
after
her
baby
then
there
were
two
hours
of
intense
misery
in
that
house
of
misery
to
all
who
were
concerned
the
servants
down
to
the
girl
in
the
scullery
and
the
boy
who
cleaned
the
boots
were
made
aware
that
master
and
mistress
were
both
determined
to
keep
their
married
daughter
a
prisoner
in
the
house
the
servants
of
the
house
sided
with
their
mistress
generally
having
all
of
them
been
induced
to
regard
john
caldigate
with
horror
hester
nurse
of
course
sympathised
with
her
and
her
baby
during
these
two
hours
the
packing
was
completed
but
hester
found
that
her
strong
and
her
bonnet
had
been
abstracted
did
they
really
think
that
at
such
a
time
as
this
boots
and
bonnets
would
be
anything
to
her
they
could
know
nothing
of
her
nature
they
could
not
understand
the
sort
of
combat
she
would
carry
on
if
an
attempt
were
made
to
take
from
her
her
liberty
an
attempt
made
by
those
who
had
by
law
no
right
to
control
her
when
once
she
had
learned
what
was
being
done
she
would
not
condescend
to
leave
her
room
till
the
carriage
should
have
come
that
that
would
come
punctually
at
twelve
she
was
sure
then
she
would
go
down
without
her
bonnet
and
without
her
boots
and
see
whether
any
one
would
dare
to
stand
in
her
way
as
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
she
would
attempt
to
walk
forth
through
the
front
door
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
other
steps
might
be
taken
just
before
twelve
the
gardener
stationed
himself
on
the
road
before
the
house
a
road
which
was
half
lane
and
half
street
belonging
to
the
suburban
village
of
chesterton
and
there
awaited
the
carriage
at
a
spot
some
yards
away
from
the
gate
it
was
well
that
he
was
early
because
richard
was
there
a
few
minutes
before
the
time
appointed
ai
back
said
the
gardener
laying
his
hands
gently
on
the
horse
back
ai
not
back
asked
the
coachman
hester
ai
john
ai
home
i
was
to
come
out
and
tell
you
as
master
do
like
wheels
on
the
gravel
if
it
can
be
helped
we
ai
got
none
of
our
own
ai
home
why
master
expects
her
for
certain
was
to
say
she
ai
the
man
who
was
driving
passed
the
reins
into
his
and
raising
his
hat
began
to
scratch
his
head
with
the
other
he
knew
at
once
that
there
was
something
wrong
that
this
prolonged
staying
away
from
home
was
not
merely
a
pleasantly
lengthened
visit
his
master
had
been
very
urgent
with
him
as
to
punctuality
and
was
evidently
intent
upon
the
return
of
his
wife
all
the
facts
of
the
accusation
were
known
to
the
man
and
the
fact
also
that
his
master
present
wife
was
entirely
in
accord
with
his
master
it
could
not
be
that
she
should
have
determined
to
prolong
her
visit
and
then
have
sent
him
back
to
her
husband
with
such
a
message
as
this
you
hold
the
hosses
just
a
minute
he
said
go
in
and
see
my
missus
but
the
grange
gardener
was
quite
as
intent
on
his
side
of
the
question
as
was
the
folking
coachman
on
the
other
to
him
the
horrors
of
bigamy
were
manifest
he
was
quite
of
opinion
that
hester
who
never
ought
to
have
been
married
in
that
way
at
all
should
now
be
kept
a
prisoner
in
her
father
house
ai
no
use
your
going
in
and
you
ca
said
the
gardener
ai
to
hold
the
horses
and
there
nobody
as
will
up
mate
do
know
as
i
mate
to
you
nor
yet
to
no
one
like
you
and
as
to
what
up
i
told
you
all
as
i
bade
to
tell
you
and
i
to
tell
you
no
more
you
ca
turn
your
horses
there
better
drive
round
into
the
village
and
there
you
get
the
back
to
cambridge
then
the
gardener
retreated
within
a
little
gate
of
his
own
which
led
from
the
lane
into
the
precincts
close
to
his
own
cottage
the
man
was
an
honest
loyal
old
fanatic
who
would
scruple
at
nothing
in
carrying
out
the
orders
of
his
mistress
in
so
good
a
cause
and
personally
his
feelings
had
been
acerbated
in
that
he
had
been
called
by
a
man
not
half
his
age
the
coachman
did
as
he
was
bid
seeing
before
him
no
other
possible
course
he
could
not
leave
his
horses
but
when
he
was
in
front
of
the
iron
gates
he
stopped
and
examined
the
premises
the
gates
were
old
and
were
opened
and
closed
at
ordinary
times
by
an
ordinary
ancient
lock
but
now
there
was
a
chain
passed
in
and
out
with
a
padlock
evidently
placed
there
to
prevent
him
from
entering
in
opposition
to
the
gardener
instructions
there
was
clearly
no
course
open
to
him
but
to
drive
the
carriage
back
to
his
master
at
a
quarter
before
twelve
hester
left
her
own
room
which
looked
backwards
into
the
garden
as
did
all
the
pleasanter
rooms
of
the
house
with
the
intention
of
seating
herself
in
a
spare
room
looking
out
to
the
front
from
which
she
could
have
seen
the
carriage
as
it
entered
the
gate
had
she
so
seen
it
she
would
certainly
have
called
to
the
man
from
the
window
when
he
was
standing
in
the
road
but
the
door
of
that
front
room
was
locked
against
her
and
when
she
tried
the
other
she
found
that
all
the
front
rooms
were
locked
she
knew
the
house
of
course
as
well
as
did
her
mother
and
she
rushed
up
to
the
attics
where
the
servants
occupied
the
rooms
looking
out
to
the
road
but
they
too
were
locked
against
her
then
it
flashed
upon
her
that
the
attempt
to
make
her
a
prisoner
was
to
be
carried
out
through
every
possible
detail
what
should
she
do
her
husband
would
come
of
course
but
what
if
he
were
unable
to
force
an
entrance
and
how
could
he
force
it
would
the
police
help
him
would
the
magistrates
help
him
she
knew
that
the
law
was
on
her
side
and
on
his
that
the
law
would
declare
him
to
be
her
lord
and
owner
till
the
law
should
have
separated
them
but
would
the
law
allow
itself
to
be
used
readily
for
this
purpose
she
too
could
understand
that
the
feeling
of
the
community
would
be
against
her
and
that
in
such
a
case
the
law
might
allow
itself
to
become
slow
lethargic
and
perhaps
inoperative
yielding
to
the
popular
feeling
she
saw
the
points
which
were
strong
against
her
as
clearly
as
william
and
robert
bolton
had
seen
those
which
were
strong
on
their
side
but
as
she
stood
there
beating
her
foot
angrily
on
the
floor
of
the
passage
she
made
up
her
mind
that
there
should
be
more
than
one
in
his
favour
if
they
kept
her
they
should
have
to
lock
her
up
as
in
a
dungeon
they
and
all
the
neighbourhood
should
hear
her
voice
they
should
be
driven
to
do
such
things
that
the
feeling
of
the
community
would
be
no
longer
on
their
side
various
ideas
passed
through
her
mind
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
would
refuse
to
take
any
nourishment
in
that
house
her
mother
would
surely
not
see
her
die
and
would
thus
have
to
see
her
die
or
else
send
her
forth
to
be
fed
but
that
thought
stayed
with
her
but
for
a
moment
it
was
not
only
for
herself
that
she
must
eat
and
drink
but
for
her
baby
then
finding
that
she
could
not
get
to
the
front
windows
and
seeing
that
the
time
had
come
in
which
the
carriage
should
have
been
there
she
went
down
into
the
hall
where
she
found
her
mother
seated
on
a
old
oak
armchair
the
windows
of
the
hall
looked
out
on
to
the
sweep
before
the
house
but
she
was
well
aware
that
from
these
lower
windows
the
plot
of
shrubs
in
the
centre
of
the
space
hindered
any
view
of
the
gate
without
speaking
to
her
mother
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
as
though
to
walk
forth
but
found
it
barred
i
a
prisoner
she
said
hester
yes
if
you
will
use
such
a
word
as
to
your
house
you
are
a
prisoner
will
not
remain
so
you
will
have
to
chain
me
and
to
gag
me
and
to
kill
me
oh
my
baby
oh
my
child
nurse
nurse
bring
me
my
boy
then
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
she
sat
down
in
another
oak
armchair
looking
at
the
there
she
would
sit
till
her
husband
should
come
he
surely
would
come
he
would
make
his
way
up
to
those
windows
and
there
she
could
at
any
rate
hear
his
commands
if
he
came
for
her
surely
she
would
be
able
to
escape
the
coachman
drove
back
to
the
town
very
quickly
and
went
to
the
inn
at
which
his
horses
were
generally
put
up
thinking
it
better
to
go
to
his
master
thence
on
foot
but
there
he
found
john
caldigate
who
had
come
across
from
seely
office
is
mrs
caldigate
he
said
as
the
man
drove
the
empty
carriage
down
the
entrance
to
the
yard
the
man
touching
his
hat
and
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
which
was
intended
to
check
his
master
impetuosity
drove
on
and
then
when
he
had
freed
himself
from
the
charge
of
his
horses
told
his
story
with
many
whispers
gardener
said
she
was
to
come
that
sir
there
something
up
more
than
you
think
sir
there
is
indeed
he
was
that
fractious
that
he
would
hold
the
hosses
for
me
not
for
a
minute
till
i
could
go
in
and
see
and
then
gates
was
chained
sir
chain
was
round
the
bars
and
a
padlock
i
never
see
such
a
thing
on
a
gentleman
gate
in
my
life
before
chained
as
nobody
was
to
go
in
nor
yet
nobody
was
to
come
out
the
man
as
he
said
this
wore
that
air
of
dignity
which
is
always
imparted
by
the
possession
of
great
tidings
the
truth
of
which
will
certainly
not
be
doubted
the
tidings
were
great
the
very
thing
which
his
father
had
suggested
and
which
he
had
declared
to
be
impossible
was
being
done
the
old
banker
himself
would
not
he
thought
have
dared
to
propose
and
carry
out
such
a
project
the
whole
bolton
family
had
conspired
together
to
keep
his
wife
from
him
and
had
allured
her
away
by
the
false
promise
of
a
friendly
visit
he
knew
too
that
the
law
was
on
his
side
but
he
knew
also
that
he
might
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
use
of
the
law
if
the
world
of
cambridge
chose
to
think
that
hester
was
not
his
wife
the
world
of
cambridge
would
probably
support
the
boltons
by
their
opinion
but
if
she
if
his
hester
were
true
to
him
and
she
certainly
would
be
true
to
him
and
if
she
were
as
courageous
as
he
believed
her
to
be
then
as
he
thought
no
house
in
chesterton
would
be
able
to
hold
her
he
stood
for
a
moment
turning
in
his
mind
what
he
had
better
do
then
he
gave
his
orders
to
the
man
in
a
clear
natural
voice
the
horses
out
richard
and
feed
them
you
had
better
get
your
dinner
here
so
that
i
may
be
sure
to
find
you
here
the
moment
i
want
you
wo
stir
a
step
from
the
place
said
the
man
chapter
xxxv
in
prison
what
should
he
do
john
caldigate
as
he
walked
out
of
the
had
to
decide
for
himself
what
he
would
do
at
once
his
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
the
mayor
and
ask
for
assistance
he
had
a
right
to
the
custody
of
his
wife
her
father
had
no
right
to
make
her
a
prisoner
she
was
entitled
to
go
whither
she
pleased
so
long
as
she
had
his
sanction
and
should
she
be
separated
from
him
by
the
action
of
the
law
she
would
be
entitled
to
go
whither
she
pleased
without
sanction
from
any
one
whether
married
or
unmarried
she
was
not
subject
to
her
father
the
husband
was
sure
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
the
police
but
he
doubted
much
whether
he
would
be
able
to
get
it
and
he
was
most
averse
to
ask
for
it
and
yet
what
other
step
could
he
take
with
no
purpose
as
yet
quite
fixed
he
went
to
the
bank
thinking
that
he
might
best
commence
his
work
by
expostulating
with
his
wife
father
it
was
bolton
habit
to
walk
every
morning
into
the
town
unless
he
was
deterred
by
heat
or
wet
or
ill
health
and
till
lately
it
had
been
his
habit
also
to
walk
back
his
house
being
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
the
bank
but
latterly
the
double
walk
had
become
too
much
for
him
and
when
the
time
for
his
return
came
he
would
send
out
for
a
cab
to
take
him
home
his
hours
were
very
various
he
would
generally
lunch
at
the
bank
in
his
own
little
dingy
room
but
if
things
went
badly
with
him
so
as
to
disturb
his
mind
he
would
go
back
early
in
the
day
and
generally
pass
the
afternoon
asleep
on
this
occasion
he
was
very
much
troubled
so
that
when
caldigate
reached
the
bank
which
he
did
before
one
bolton
was
already
getting
into
his
cab
i
speak
a
few
words
to
you
sir
said
caldigate
in
the
street
am
not
very
well
said
the
banker
hardly
looking
round
persevering
in
his
effort
to
get
into
the
vehicle
would
not
keep
you
for
a
minute
sir
i
must
see
you
as
you
are
aware
there
were
already
people
collected
all
of
whom
had
no
doubt
heard
the
story
of
john
caldigate
wife
there
was
indeed
no
man
or
woman
in
cambridge
whose
ears
it
had
not
reached
in
the
hearing
of
these
bolton
was
determined
not
to
speak
of
his
daughter
and
he
was
equally
determined
not
to
go
back
into
the
house
have
nothing
to
say
he
muttered
nothing
drive
on
so
the
cab
was
driven
on
and
john
caldigate
was
left
in
the
street
the
man
anger
now
produced
a
fixed
purpose
and
with
a
quick
step
he
walked
away
from
the
bank
to
robert
bolton
office
there
he
soon
found
himself
in
the
attorney
room
you
aware
of
what
they
are
doing
at
the
grange
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
was
not
so
guarded
as
it
should
have
been
on
such
an
occasion
anger
and
the
quickness
of
his
walk
had
combined
to
make
him
short
of
breath
and
he
asked
the
question
with
that
flurried
hasty
manner
which
is
common
to
angry
people
who
are
hot
rather
than
malicious
in
their
angers
do
think
i
am
said
the
attorney
if
i
were
i
doubt
whether
i
should
just
at
present
be
willing
to
discuss
their
doings
with
you
wife
has
gone
there
on
a
visit
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
is
the
best
thing
that
my
sister
could
do
now
it
seems
some
difficulty
is
made
about
her
returning
that
i
think
very
likely
her
father
and
mother
can
hardly
wish
that
she
should
go
back
to
your
house
at
present
i
can
not
imagine
that
she
should
wish
it
herself
if
you
have
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
or
the
heart
of
a
man
you
ought
not
to
wish
it
have
not
come
here
to
be
taught
what
is
becoming
either
to
a
man
or
a
gentleman
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
while
things
are
as
they
are
at
present
you
ought
not
to
come
here
at
all
should
not
have
done
so
but
for
this
violence
this
breach
of
all
hospitality
at
your
father
house
my
wife
went
there
with
the
understanding
that
she
was
to
stay
for
two
days
now
you
say
they
detain
her
i
am
not
responsible
but
in
doing
so
they
have
my
thorough
sympathy
and
approbation
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
help
them
or
that
they
will
want
my
help
but
i
shall
help
them
if
i
can
the
fact
is
you
had
better
leave
her
there
should
not
have
volunteered
my
advice
but
as
you
are
here
i
may
perhaps
say
a
word
if
you
attempt
to
take
her
by
violence
from
her
father
house
you
will
have
all
the
town
all
the
county
all
england
against
you
should
i
own
it
unless
she
wished
to
come
to
me
if
she
chooses
to
stay
she
shall
stay
must
not
be
left
to
her
if
she
be
so
infatuated
she
must
not
be
allowed
to
judge
for
herself
till
this
trial
be
over
she
and
you
must
live
apart
then
if
that
woman
does
not
make
good
her
claim
if
you
can
prove
that
the
woman
is
lying
then
you
will
have
back
your
wife
but
if
as
everybody
i
find
believes
at
present
it
should
be
proved
that
you
are
the
husband
of
that
woman
and
that
you
have
basely
betrayed
my
poor
sister
by
a
mock
marriage
then
she
must
be
left
to
the
care
of
her
father
and
her
mother
and
may
heaven
help
her
in
her
misery
all
this
he
said
with
much
dignity
and
in
a
manner
with
which
even
caldigate
could
not
take
personal
offence
must
remember
he
added
this
poor
injured
one
is
their
daughter
and
my
sister
say
that
she
has
been
in
no
wise
injured
but
as
i
also
am
injured
by
a
wicked
plot
and
i
say
that
she
shall
come
back
to
me
unless
she
herself
elects
to
remain
with
her
parents
then
he
left
the
office
and
went
forth
again
into
the
streets
he
now
took
at
once
the
road
to
chesterton
trying
as
he
did
so
to
make
for
himself
in
his
own
mind
a
plan
or
map
of
the
premises
it
would
he
thought
be
impossible
but
that
his
wife
would
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
come
to
him
if
he
could
only
make
her
aware
of
his
presence
but
then
there
was
the
baby
and
it
would
be
necessary
not
only
that
she
should
escape
herself
but
that
she
should
bring
her
child
with
her
would
they
attempt
to
hold
her
could
it
be
that
they
should
have
already
locked
her
up
in
some
room
and
if
she
did
escape
out
of
some
window
even
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
how
would
it
be
with
them
then
as
they
made
their
way
back
into
the
town
thinking
of
this
he
hurried
back
to
the
inn
and
told
richard
to
take
the
carriage
into
chesterton
and
wait
there
at
the
turn
of
the
lane
where
the
lane
leads
down
from
the
main
road
to
the
grange
he
was
to
wait
there
though
it
might
be
all
the
day
till
he
heard
from
or
saw
his
master
the
man
who
was
quite
as
keen
for
his
master
as
was
the
old
gardener
for
his
mistress
on
the
other
side
promised
accurate
obedience
then
he
retraced
his
steps
and
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
grange
during
all
this
time
the
mother
and
the
daughter
kept
their
weary
seats
in
the
hall
hester
having
her
baby
in
her
arms
she
had
quite
determined
that
nothing
should
induce
her
again
to
go
lest
the
key
of
the
room
should
be
turned
upon
her
for
a
long
time
they
sat
in
silence
and
then
she
declared
her
purpose
shall
remain
here
mamma
so
i
must
remain
too
shall
not
go
up
to
my
bedroom
again
you
may
be
sure
of
that
will
go
up
i
hope
not
nurse
shall
take
baby
up
to
his
cradle
i
do
not
suppose
you
will
be
cruel
enough
to
separate
me
from
my
child
do
you
not
know
that
i
would
do
anything
for
you
or
your
child
that
i
would
die
for
you
or
your
child
suppose
you
will
let
them
bring
me
food
here
you
would
not
wish
him
to
be
starved
what
would
you
have
me
say
are
you
not
my
jailer
am
your
mother
according
to
my
conscience
i
am
acting
for
you
as
best
i
know
how
do
you
not
know
that
i
mean
to
be
good
to
you
know
you
are
not
good
to
me
nobody
can
be
good
who
tries
to
separate
me
from
my
husband
i
shall
remain
here
till
he
comes
and
tells
me
how
i
am
to
be
taken
away
then
bolton
returned
and
made
his
way
into
the
house
with
the
assistance
of
the
gardener
through
the
kitchen
he
found
the
two
women
sitting
in
the
hall
each
in
the
and
his
daughter
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
a
most
piteous
sight
the
two
of
them
thus
together
she
said
as
he
came
up
into
the
hall
from
the
kitchen
are
treating
me
badly
cruelly
unjustly
you
have
no
right
to
keep
me
here
against
my
will
i
am
my
husband
wife
and
i
must
go
to
my
husband
is
for
the
best
hester
is
wrong
can
not
be
for
the
best
do
you
suppose
that
he
will
let
me
be
kept
here
in
prison
of
course
he
will
come
why
do
you
not
let
me
go
is
right
that
you
should
be
here
hester
he
said
as
he
passed
to
his
own
bedroom
it
was
a
terrible
job
of
work
for
which
he
had
no
strength
whatever
himself
and
as
to
which
he
was
beginning
to
doubt
whether
even
his
wife
strength
would
suffice
as
for
her
as
for
hester
perhaps
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
be
wearied
and
broken
into
submission
but
it
was
fearful
to
think
that
his
wife
should
have
to
sit
there
the
whole
day
saying
nothing
doing
nothing
merely
watching
lest
her
daughter
should
attempt
to
escape
through
some
window
will
kill
your
father
i
think
said
the
mother
does
he
not
let
me
go
then
i
have
to
think
of
my
husband
and
my
child
then
again
there
was
silence
when
they
had
been
seated
thus
for
two
hours
all
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
between
them
had
not
spread
themselves
over
ten
minutes
and
bolton
was
looking
forward
to
hour
after
hour
of
the
same
kind
it
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
possible
that
hester
should
be
forced
up
into
her
own
room
even
she
with
all
her
hardihood
could
not
ask
the
men
about
the
place
to
take
her
in
their
arms
and
carry
her
with
violence
up
the
stairs
nor
would
the
men
have
done
it
if
so
required
nothing
but
a
policeman
garb
will
seem
to
justify
the
laying
of
a
hand
upon
a
woman
and
even
that
will
hardly
do
it
unless
the
woman
be
odiously
disreputable
bolton
saw
clearly
what
was
before
her
should
hester
be
strong
in
her
purpose
to
remain
seated
as
at
present
she
also
must
remain
seated
weariness
and
solicitude
for
her
baby
might
perhaps
drive
the
young
mother
to
bed
then
she
also
would
go
to
her
bed
and
would
rest
with
one
eye
ever
open
with
her
ears
always
on
the
alert
she
was
somewhat
sure
of
herself
her
life
had
not
been
so
soft
but
that
she
could
endure
much
and
of
her
purpose
she
was
quite
sure
nothing
would
trouble
her
conscience
if
she
could
succeed
in
keeping
her
daughter
separated
from
john
caldigate
caldigate
in
his
hot
haste
walked
up
to
the
iron
gates
and
found
them
chained
it
was
in
vain
that
he
shook
them
and
in
vain
that
he
looked
at
them
the
gates
were
fully
twelve
feet
high
and
spiked
at
the
top
at
each
side
of
the
gates
ran
a
wall
surmounted
by
iron
railings
extending
to
the
gardener
cottage
on
the
one
side
and
to
the
on
the
other
the
drive
up
to
the
house
which
swept
round
a
plot
of
thick
shrubs
lay
between
the
various
offices
the
stables
and
being
on
one
side
and
the
laundry
and
gardener
cottage
on
the
other
from
the
road
there
was
no
mode
of
ingress
for
him
to
this
enclosure
unless
he
could
get
over
the
railings
this
might
perhaps
have
been
possible
but
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
him
to
bring
his
wife
back
by
the
same
way
there
was
a
bell
at
the
gardener
little
gate
which
he
rang
loudly
but
no
one
would
come
to
him
at
last
he
made
his
way
round
into
the
by
a
corner
where
access
was
made
by
climbing
a
moderately
high
gate
which
gave
an
entrance
to
the
fields
from
thence
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
on
to
the
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
up
by
stone
steps
to
the
terrace
which
ran
along
under
the
windows
here
he
found
that
the
lower
shutters
were
barred
on
the
inside
throughout
so
that
he
could
not
look
into
any
of
the
rooms
but
he
could
rap
at
the
windows
which
he
did
loudly
and
it
was
in
his
power
to
break
them
if
he
pleased
he
rapped
very
loudly
but
poor
hester
who
sat
at
the
front
hall
heard
nothing
of
the
noise
he
knew
that
from
the
he
could
make
his
way
to
the
front
with
more
or
less
of
violence
between
the
gardener
cottage
and
the
laundry
there
was
a
covered
passage
leading
to
the
front
the
buildings
above
being
continuous
but
leaving
a
way
through
for
the
convenience
of
the
servants
this
however
was
guarded
by
a
gate
but
even
on
this
gate
the
gardener
had
managed
to
fix
a
lock
when
caldigate
reached
the
spot
the
man
was
standing
idle
and
observant
at
his
own
cottage
door
had
better
open
this
gate
said
caldigate
i
shall
kick
it
open
must
do
that
caldigate
it
master
orders
as
it
to
be
locked
it
master
orders
as
you
ai
to
be
in
here
at
all
then
caldigate
raised
his
foot
and
the
gate
was
very
soon
despatched
well
said
the
man
well
caldigate
that
have
to
come
agin
you
when
the
other
things
come
it
my
belief
as
it
burglorious
then
caldigate
went
up
before
the
house
windows
and
the
gardener
followed
him
the
front
door
was
approached
by
stone
steps
which
were
guarded
on
each
side
by
a
curved
iron
rail
along
the
whole
front
of
the
house
passing
under
the
steps
there
ran
a
narrow
shallow
area
contrived
simply
to
give
light
to
the
kitchen
and
offices
in
the
basement
storey
but
this
area
was
again
guarded
by
an
iron
rail
which
was
so
constructed
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
any
one
less
expert
than
a
practised
should
get
in
or
out
of
any
of
the
windows
looking
that
way
from
the
hall
there
were
no
less
than
four
windows
looking
to
the
front
but
they
were
all
equally
unapproachable
the
moment
that
caldigate
appeared
coming
round
the
curve
of
the
gravel
road
hester
saw
him
jumping
up
from
her
chair
with
her
baby
she
rushed
to
the
window
and
called
to
him
aloud
tapping
at
the
window
as
she
did
so
i
am
here
come
to
me
come
to
me
take
me
out
they
have
shut
me
in
and
will
not
let
me
come
to
you
then
she
held
up
the
baby
let
him
in
so
that
he
come
to
his
own
baby
you
dare
not
keep
the
father
away
from
his
own
child
at
this
time
the
nurse
was
in
the
hall
as
was
also
the
cook
but
the
front
door
was
locked
as
well
as
chained
and
the
key
was
in
bolton
own
pocket
she
sat
perfectly
silent
rigid
without
a
motion
she
had
known
that
he
would
come
and
show
himself
and
she
had
determined
that
she
would
be
rigid
silent
and
motionless
she
would
not
move
or
speak
unless
hester
should
endeavour
to
make
her
way
down
into
the
kitchen
but
just
in
the
passage
which
led
to
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
stood
the
cook
strong
solid
almost
twice
the
weight
of
hester
a
pious
determined
woman
on
whom
her
mistress
could
depend
that
she
would
remain
there
impervious
they
could
talk
to
each
other
now
hester
and
caldigate
each
explaining
or
suggesting
what
had
been
done
or
should
be
done
but
they
could
converse
only
so
that
their
enemies
around
them
should
hear
every
word
that
was
spoken
john
no
i
will
not
stay
she
said
when
her
husband
told
her
that
he
would
leave
the
decision
to
her
it
be
to
do
your
bidding
i
will
not
stay
here
willingly
and
john
i
will
not
move
upstairs
i
will
remain
here
and
if
they
choose
to
give
me
food
they
may
bring
it
to
me
unless
they
carry
me
i
will
not
go
to
my
bedroom
and
they
shall
tear
me
to
pieces
before
i
will
let
them
carry
me
poor
baby
poor
baby
i
know
he
will
be
ill
she
said
moaning
but
still
so
that
he
standing
beyond
the
railings
should
hear
her
through
the
window
know
he
will
be
ill
but
what
can
i
do
they
do
not
care
for
my
baby
if
he
should
die
it
will
be
nothing
to
them
during
all
this
bolton
kept
her
resolve
and
sat
there
rigid
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
speaking
no
word
apparently
paying
no
attention
to
the
scene
around
her
her
back
was
turned
to
the
front
door
so
that
she
could
not
see
john
caldigate
nor
would
she
attempt
to
look
at
him
he
could
not
get
in
nor
could
the
other
get
out
if
that
were
so
she
would
endeavour
to
bear
it
all
in
the
meantime
the
old
man
was
sitting
in
his
up
in
his
bedroom
reduced
almost
to
inanity
of
mind
by
the
horror
of
the
occasion
when
he
could
think
of
it
all
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
must
let
her
go
he
could
not
keep
the
mother
and
her
baby
a
prisoner
in
such
a
condition
as
this
then
there
came
dinner
let
misfortunes
be
what
they
may
dinner
will
come
the
old
man
crawled
and
hester
was
invited
into
the
she
said
you
choose
to
send
it
to
me
here
because
of
baby
i
will
eat
then
neither
would
bolton
go
to
her
husband
but
both
of
them
seated
in
their
ate
their
food
with
their
plates
upon
their
laps
during
this
time
caldigate
still
remained
outside
but
in
vain
as
circumstances
were
at
present
he
had
no
means
of
approaching
his
wife
he
could
kick
down
a
slight
gate
but
he
could
bring
no
adequate
force
to
bear
against
the
stout
front
door
at
last
when
the
dusk
of
evening
came
on
he
took
his
departure
assuring
his
wife
that
he
would
be
there
again
on
the
following
morning
chapter
xxxvi
the
escape
during
the
whole
of
that
night
hester
kept
her
position
in
the
hall
holding
her
baby
in
her
arms
as
long
as
the
infant
would
sleep
in
that
position
and
then
allowing
the
nurse
to
take
it
to
its
cradle
and
during
the
whole
night
also
bolton
remained
with
her
daughter
tea
was
brought
to
them
which
each
of
them
took
and
after
that
neither
spoke
a
word
to
the
other
till
the
morning
before
he
went
to
bed
bolton
came
down
and
made
an
effort
for
their
joint
comfort
he
said
should
you
not
go
to
your
room
you
can
do
yourself
no
good
by
remaining
there
she
said
sullenly
i
will
stay
will
only
make
yourself
ill
you
and
your
mother
can
go
though
i
should
die
i
will
stay
here
nor
could
he
succeed
better
with
his
wife
she
is
obstinate
so
must
i
be
said
bolton
it
was
in
vain
that
he
endeavoured
to
prove
to
her
that
there
could
be
no
reason
for
such
obstinacy
that
her
daughter
would
not
attempt
to
escape
during
the
hours
of
the
night
without
her
baby
would
not
do
that
said
the
old
man
turning
to
his
daughter
but
to
this
hester
would
make
no
reply
and
bolton
simply
declared
her
purpose
of
remaining
to
her
mind
there
was
present
an
idea
that
she
would
at
any
rate
endure
as
much
actual
suffering
as
her
daughter
there
they
both
sat
and
in
the
morning
they
were
objects
pitiable
to
be
seen
macbeth
and
sancho
have
been
equally
eloquent
in
the
praise
of
sleep
that
knits
up
the
ravelled
sleave
of
care
but
sleep
will
knit
up
effectually
no
broken
stitches
unless
it
be
enjoyed
in
bed
on
him
who
invented
sleep
said
sancho
but
the
great
inventor
was
he
who
discovered
mattresses
and
sheets
and
blankets
these
two
unfortunates
no
doubt
slept
but
in
the
morning
they
were
weary
comfortless
and
exhausted
towels
and
basins
were
brought
to
them
and
then
they
prepared
themselves
to
watch
through
another
day
it
seemed
to
be
a
trial
between
them
which
could
outwatch
the
other
the
mother
was
of
course
much
the
older
but
with
poor
hester
there
was
the
baby
to
add
to
her
troubles
never
was
there
a
woman
more
determined
to
carry
out
her
purpose
than
bolton
or
one
more
determined
to
thwart
the
purpose
of
another
than
she
who
still
called
herself
hester
caldigate
in
the
morning
bolton
implored
her
husband
to
go
into
cambridge
as
usual
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
leave
the
house
with
such
inmates
so
he
sat
in
his
bedroom
dozing
wretchedly
in
his
caldigate
appeared
before
the
house
at
nine
no
further
attempt
having
been
made
to
exclude
his
entrance
by
the
side
gate
and
asked
to
see
bolton
is
said
hester
through
the
window
but
the
old
man
would
not
come
down
to
see
his
visitor
nor
would
he
send
any
message
then
caldigate
declared
his
purpose
of
going
at
once
to
the
mayor
and
demanding
assistance
from
the
police
he
at
any
rate
would
return
with
the
carriage
as
early
as
he
could
after
his
visit
to
the
magistrates
office
he
went
to
the
mayor
and
inflicted
much
trouble
on
that
excellent
officer
who
however
at
last
with
the
assistance
of
his
clerk
and
of
robert
bolton
whom
he
saw
on
the
sly
came
to
the
decision
that
his
own
authority
would
not
suffice
for
the
breaking
open
of
a
man
house
in
order
that
his
married
daughter
should
be
taken
by
violence
from
his
custody
doubt
he
said
doubt
when
caldigate
pleaded
that
bolton
daughter
was
at
any
rate
for
the
present
his
own
wife
and
that
a
man
right
to
have
his
wife
is
undoubted
those
words
doubt
were
said
very
often
but
no
other
words
were
said
then
the
clerk
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
proper
course
would
be
for
caldigate
to
go
up
to
london
and
get
an
order
from
the
which
was
of
course
tantamount
to
saying
that
his
wife
was
to
remain
at
chesterton
till
after
the
trial
unless
she
could
effect
her
own
escape
but
not
on
that
account
was
he
inclined
to
yield
he
had
felt
from
the
first
as
had
she
also
that
she
would
make
her
way
out
of
the
house
or
would
not
make
it
as
she
might
or
might
not
have
the
courage
to
be
persistent
in
demanding
it
this
indeed
had
been
felt
both
by
william
and
robert
bolton
when
they
had
given
their
counsel
is
a
woman
with
a
baby
and
when
in
your
house
will
be
subject
to
your
influences
she
will
be
very
angry
at
first
but
will
probably
yield
after
a
time
to
your
instructions
she
will
at
last
give
an
unwilling
assent
to
the
course
you
propose
that
is
what
may
be
expected
but
if
she
should
be
firmer
than
we
think
if
there
should
be
in
her
bosom
a
greater
power
of
resistance
than
we
expect
should
she
dash
herself
too
violently
against
the
cage
then
you
must
let
her
go
that
was
intended
to
be
the
gist
of
the
advice
given
though
it
perhaps
was
not
so
accurately
expressed
it
was
in
that
way
understood
by
the
old
man
but
bolton
would
not
so
understand
it
she
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
and
as
she
pressed
her
lips
together
she
told
herself
that
she
intended
to
go
through
with
it
and
so
did
hester
but
as
this
day
went
on
hester
became
at
times
almost
hysterical
in
her
efforts
to
communicate
with
her
husband
through
the
window
holding
up
her
baby
and
throwing
back
her
head
and
was
almost
in
convulsions
in
her
efforts
to
get
at
him
he
on
the
other
side
thundered
at
the
door
with
the
knocker
till
that
instrument
had
been
unscrewed
from
within
but
still
he
could
knock
with
his
stick
and
shout
with
his
voice
while
the
people
outside
the
iron
gates
stood
looking
on
in
a
crowd
in
the
course
of
the
day
robert
bolton
endeavoured
to
get
an
order
from
the
magistrates
for
the
removal
of
caldigate
by
the
police
but
the
mayor
would
not
assent
either
to
that
old
bolton
was
the
owner
of
the
house
and
if
there
was
a
nuisance
to
be
complained
of
it
was
he
that
must
complain
the
mayor
during
these
days
was
much
tried
the
steady
married
people
of
the
borough
the
shopkeepers
and
their
wives
the
doctors
and
lawyers
and
clergymen
were
in
favour
of
and
bolton
it
was
held
to
be
fitting
that
a
poor
lady
in
unfortunate
position
should
be
consigned
to
the
care
of
her
parents
till
the
matter
had
been
settled
but
the
people
generally
sympathised
with
the
young
husband
and
young
wife
and
were
loud
in
denouncing
the
illegality
of
the
banker
proceedings
and
it
was
already
rumoured
that
among
the
undergraduates
caldigate
side
was
favoured
it
was
generally
known
that
crinkett
and
the
woman
had
asked
for
money
before
they
had
brought
their
accusation
and
on
that
account
sympathy
ran
with
the
squire
of
folking
the
mayor
therefore
did
not
dare
to
give
an
order
that
caldigate
should
be
removed
from
off
the
premises
at
puritan
grange
knowing
that
he
was
there
in
search
of
a
wife
who
was
only
anxious
to
place
herself
in
his
custody
but
nothing
was
done
all
that
day
about
four
in
the
afternoon
while
caldigate
was
still
there
and
at
a
moment
in
which
poor
hester
had
been
reduced
by
the
continuance
of
her
efforts
to
a
state
of
hysterical
prostration
the
old
man
summoned
his
wife
upstairs
she
with
a
motion
to
the
cook
who
still
guarded
the
stairs
obeyed
the
order
and
for
a
moment
left
her
watch
must
let
her
go
said
the
old
man
with
tremulous
anxiety
beating
with
his
fingers
on
his
knees
as
he
spoke
must
let
her
go
no
will
kill
her
i
let
her
go
i
shall
kill
her
soul
said
the
determined
woman
not
her
soul
more
than
her
body
will
say
we
murdered
her
will
say
it
and
what
would
that
be
but
the
breath
of
a
man
does
not
our
father
who
is
in
heaven
know
that
i
would
die
to
do
her
a
service
if
the
service
accorded
with
his
will
does
he
not
know
that
i
am
cruel
to
her
here
in
order
that
she
may
be
saved
from
eternal
she
was
going
to
say
in
the
natural
fervour
of
her
speech
eternal
cruelty
to
come
but
she
checked
herself
to
have
admitted
that
such
a
judgment
could
be
worse
than
just
worse
even
than
merciful
would
be
blasphemy
to
her
he
knows
he
knows
and
if
he
knows
what
matters
what
men
say
that
i
have
done
to
her
can
not
have
it
go
on
like
this
said
he
still
whispering
will
be
wearied
out
and
then
we
will
take
her
to
her
bed
but
bolton
succeeded
in
demanding
that
a
telegram
should
be
sent
up
to
william
requesting
him
to
come
down
to
the
grange
as
early
as
possible
on
the
following
morning
this
was
sent
and
also
a
message
to
robert
bolton
in
cambridge
telling
him
that
william
had
been
summoned
during
these
two
days
he
had
not
been
seen
at
the
grange
though
he
knew
much
of
what
was
being
done
there
had
he
however
been
aware
of
all
that
his
sister
and
were
enduring
he
would
probably
have
appeared
upon
the
scene
as
it
was
he
had
justified
his
absence
by
pleading
to
himself
bolton
personal
enmity
and
the
understanding
which
existed
that
he
should
not
visit
the
house
then
when
it
was
dark
caldigate
with
the
carriage
again
returned
to
the
town
where
he
slept
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
night
again
their
food
was
brought
to
the
two
women
in
the
hall
and
again
each
of
them
swallowed
a
cup
of
tea
as
they
prepared
themselves
for
the
work
of
the
night
in
the
hall
there
was
a
which
was
kept
burning
and
gave
a
faint
glimmer
so
that
each
could
see
the
outline
of
the
other
light
beyond
that
there
was
none
in
the
weary
long
hours
of
nights
such
as
these
nights
passed
on
the
seats
of
railway
carriages
or
rougher
nights
such
as
some
of
us
remember
on
the
outside
of
coaches
or
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
sick
sleep
will
come
early
and
will
early
go
the
weariness
of
the
past
day
will
produce
some
forgetfulness
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
come
the
slow
cold
sad
hours
through
which
the
dawn
has
to
be
expected
between
two
and
three
these
unfortunates
were
both
awake
the
poor
baby
having
been
but
lately
carried
back
from
its
mother
to
its
cradle
then
suddenly
bolton
heard
rather
than
saw
her
daughter
slip
down
from
her
chair
on
to
the
ground
and
stretch
herself
along
upon
the
hard
floor
she
said
but
hester
did
not
answer
are
you
hurt
when
there
was
still
no
answer
the
mother
got
up
with
limbs
so
stiff
that
she
could
hardly
use
them
and
stood
over
her
child
speak
to
me
will
never
speak
to
you
more
said
the
daughter
child
why
will
you
not
go
to
your
comfortable
wholesome
bed
will
not
go
i
will
die
here
door
shall
not
be
locked
you
shall
have
the
key
with
you
i
will
do
nothing
to
hurt
you
if
you
will
go
to
your
bed
will
not
go
leave
me
alone
you
can
not
love
me
mamma
or
you
would
not
treat
me
like
this
you
oh
my
child
if
you
knew
if
you
could
understand
why
am
i
doing
this
is
it
not
because
i
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
will
you
let
me
take
you
to
your
bed
never
i
too
can
do
my
duty
my
duty
to
my
husband
it
is
to
remain
here
till
i
can
get
to
him
even
though
i
should
die
then
she
turned
her
poor
limbs
on
the
hard
floor
and
the
mother
covered
her
with
a
cloak
and
placed
a
cushion
beneath
her
head
then
after
standing
a
while
over
her
child
she
returned
to
her
chair
and
did
not
move
or
speak
again
till
the
old
cook
came
with
the
first
glimmer
of
the
morning
to
inquire
how
the
night
had
been
passed
can
not
allow
this
i
can
not
allow
this
said
bolton
when
he
shuffled
down
in
his
slippers
the
old
servant
had
been
up
to
him
and
had
warned
him
that
such
sufferings
as
these
might
have
a
tragic
end
too
probably
an
end
fatal
to
the
infant
if
the
mother
strength
should
altogether
fail
her
would
it
not
go
badly
with
the
baby
so
the
cook
had
argued
who
had
been
stern
enough
herself
anxious
enough
to
secure
hester
from
the
wickedness
of
john
caldigate
but
she
was
now
cowed
and
frightened
and
had
acknowledged
to
herself
that
if
hester
would
not
give
way
then
she
must
be
allowed
to
go
forth
let
the
wickedness
be
what
it
might
must
be
an
end
to
this
said
the
old
man
end
asked
his
wife
her
obey
her
parents
will
obey
only
my
husband
said
hester
course
there
must
be
an
end
let
her
go
to
her
bed
and
weary
as
i
am
i
will
wait
upon
her
as
only
a
mother
can
wait
upon
her
child
have
i
not
prayed
for
her
through
the
watches
of
the
night
that
she
might
be
delivered
from
this
calamity
that
she
might
be
comforted
by
him
in
her
sorrow
what
have
i
done
these
two
last
weary
days
but
pray
to
the
lord
god
that
he
might
be
merciful
to
her
me
go
said
hester
will
not
let
you
go
said
the
mother
rising
from
her
seat
too
can
suffer
i
too
can
endure
i
will
not
be
conquered
by
my
own
child
there
spoke
the
human
being
that
was
the
utterance
natural
to
the
woman
this
struggle
hard
as
it
is
i
will
not
be
beat
by
one
who
has
been
subject
to
my
authority
in
all
those
prayers
and
she
had
prayed
there
had
been
the
prayer
in
her
heart
if
not
in
her
words
that
she
might
be
saved
from
the
humiliation
of
yielding
early
in
the
day
caldigate
was
again
in
front
of
the
house
and
outside
there
was
a
close
carriage
with
a
pair
of
horses
standing
at
the
gardener
little
gate
and
at
the
front
gate
which
was
still
chained
there
was
again
the
crowd
at
about
one
both
william
and
robert
bolton
came
upon
the
scene
and
were
admitted
by
the
gardener
and
cook
through
the
into
the
house
they
were
close
to
caldigate
as
they
entered
neither
did
they
speak
to
him
or
he
to
them
at
that
moment
hester
was
standing
with
the
baby
at
the
window
and
saw
them
i
shall
be
allowed
to
go
she
exclaimed
bolton
was
still
seated
with
her
back
to
the
windows
but
she
had
heard
the
steps
on
the
gravel
and
the
opening
of
the
and
she
understood
hester
words
and
was
aware
that
her
husband
sons
were
in
the
house
they
had
agreed
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
at
once
made
their
way
up
into
the
hall
you
will
make
them
let
me
go
you
will
make
them
let
me
go
said
hester
rushing
at
once
to
the
elder
of
the
two
and
holding
out
her
baby
as
though
for
him
to
take
she
was
now
in
a
state
so
excited
so
nervous
so
nearly
hysterical
that
she
was
hardly
able
to
control
herself
will
not
let
them
kill
me
william
me
and
my
baby
he
kissed
her
and
said
a
kind
word
or
two
and
then
inquiring
after
his
father
passed
on
then
bolton
followed
him
leaving
robert
in
the
hall
with
hester
know
that
you
have
turned
against
me
said
hester
no
i
have
never
turned
against
you
i
have
thought
that
you
would
be
better
here
than
at
folking
for
the
present
is
being
against
me
a
woman
should
be
with
her
husband
you
told
them
to
do
this
and
they
have
nearly
killed
me
me
and
my
baby
in
the
meantime
william
bolton
was
very
decided
in
his
opinion
that
they
must
at
once
allow
caldigate
to
take
her
back
to
folking
she
had
as
he
said
proved
herself
to
be
too
strong
for
them
the
experiment
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
no
doubt
it
would
be
better
so
he
thought
that
she
should
remain
for
the
present
at
the
grange
so
much
better
that
a
certain
show
of
force
had
been
justified
but
as
things
were
going
no
further
force
would
be
justified
she
had
proved
her
power
and
must
be
allowed
to
go
bolton
however
would
not
even
yet
acknowledge
that
she
was
beaten
in
a
few
more
hours
she
thought
hester
would
allow
herself
to
be
taken
to
her
bed
and
then
all
might
be
well
but
she
could
not
stand
against
the
combined
force
of
her
husband
and
his
two
sons
and
so
it
was
decided
that
the
front
door
should
be
opened
for
the
prisoner
and
that
the
chains
should
be
removed
from
the
gate
should
be
afraid
of
the
people
william
bolton
said
to
his
father
it
was
not
till
this
decision
had
been
given
that
bolton
felt
that
the
struggle
of
the
last
three
days
had
been
too
much
for
her
now
at
last
she
threw
herself
upon
her
bed
weeping
bitter
tears
tears
of
a
broken
spirit
and
there
she
lay
prostrate
with
fatigue
and
misery
nor
would
she
go
down
to
say
a
word
of
farewell
how
could
she
say
adieu
to
her
daughter
leaving
her
house
in
such
circumstances
will
give
her
your
love
said
william
bolton
nothing
to
her
she
does
not
care
for
my
love
nor
for
the
love
of
her
father
in
heaven
she
cares
only
for
that
adulterer
the
door
was
opened
from
within
and
the
chains
were
taken
away
from
the
gate
john
oh
my
husband
she
exclaimed
as
she
leaped
down
the
steps
into
his
arms
let
me
go
again
not
for
a
day
not
for
an
hour
then
her
boxes
were
brought
down
and
the
nurse
came
with
the
child
whom
the
mother
at
once
took
and
placed
in
his
father
arms
and
the
carriage
was
brought
in
and
the
luggage
was
placed
on
it
and
the
nurse
and
the
baby
were
seated
will
go
up
to
poor
mamma
for
one
moment
she
said
she
did
go
to
her
mother
room
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
wretched
woman
wept
over
her
and
kissed
her
but
the
mother
though
in
some
sort
she
returned
the
caress
said
not
a
word
as
her
daughter
left
the
room
and
she
went
also
to
her
father
and
asked
his
blessing
he
muttered
a
word
or
two
blessing
her
no
doubt
with
inarticulate
words
he
also
had
been
thoroughly
vanquished
then
she
got
into
the
carriage
and
was
taken
back
to
folking
lying
in
john
caldigate
arms
chapter
xxxvii
again
at
folking
thus
hester
prevailed
and
was
taken
back
to
the
house
of
the
man
who
had
married
her
by
this
time
very
much
had
been
said
about
the
matter
publicly
it
had
been
impossible
to
keep
the
question
whether
john
caldigate
recent
marriage
had
been
true
or
fraudulent
out
of
the
newspapers
and
now
the
attempt
that
had
been
made
to
keep
them
apart
by
force
gave
an
additional
interest
to
the
subject
there
was
an
opinion
very
general
among
elderly
educated
people
that
hester
ought
to
have
allowed
herself
to
be
detained
at
the
grange
do
not
mean
to
lean
heavily
on
the
unfortunate
young
lady
said
the
we
think
that
she
would
have
better
shown
a
becoming
sense
of
her
position
had
she
submitted
her
self
to
her
parents
till
the
trial
is
over
then
the
full
sympathy
of
all
classes
would
have
been
with
her
and
whether
the
law
shall
restore
her
to
a
beloved
husband
or
shall
tell
her
that
she
has
become
the
victim
of
a
cruel
seducer
she
would
have
been
supported
by
the
approval
and
generous
regard
of
all
men
it
was
thus
for
the
most
part
that
the
elderly
and
the
wise
spoke
and
thought
about
it
of
course
they
pitied
her
but
they
believed
all
evil
of
caldigate
declaring
that
he
too
was
bound
by
a
feeling
of
duty
to
restore
the
unfortunate
one
to
her
father
and
mother
until
the
matter
should
have
been
set
at
rest
by
the
decision
of
a
jury
but
the
people
especially
the
people
of
utterden
and
netherden
and
of
chesterton
and
even
of
cambridge
were
all
on
the
side
of
caldigate
and
hester
as
a
married
couple
they
liked
the
persistency
with
which
he
had
claimed
his
wife
and
applauded
her
to
the
echo
for
her
love
and
firmness
of
course
the
scene
at
puritan
grange
had
been
much
exaggerated
the
two
nights
were
prolonged
to
intervals
varying
from
a
week
to
a
fortnight
during
that
time
she
was
said
always
to
have
been
at
the
window
holding
up
her
baby
and
bolton
was
accused
of
cruelties
which
she
certainly
had
not
committed
some
details
of
the
affair
made
their
way
into
the
metropolitan
press
so
that
the
expected
trial
became
one
of
those
by
which
the
public
is
from
time
to
time
kept
alive
to
the
value
and
charm
of
newspapers
during
all
this
john
caldigate
was
specially
careful
not
to
seclude
himself
from
public
view
or
to
seem
to
be
afraid
of
his
he
was
constantly
in
cambridge
generally
riding
thither
on
horseback
and
on
such
occasions
was
always
to
be
seen
in
trumpington
street
and
trinity
street
between
him
and
the
boltons
there
was
by
tacit
consent
no
intercourse
whatever
after
the
attempted
imprisonment
he
never
showed
himself
at
robert
office
nor
when
they
met
in
the
street
did
they
speak
to
each
other
indeed
at
this
time
no
gentleman
or
lady
held
any
intercourse
with
caldigate
except
his
father
and
bromley
the
clergyman
the
babingtons
were
strongly
of
opinion
that
he
should
have
surrendered
the
care
of
his
wife
and
aunt
polly
went
so
far
as
to
write
to
him
when
she
first
heard
of
the
affair
at
chesterton
recommending
him
very
strongly
to
leave
her
at
the
grange
then
there
was
an
angry
correspondence
ended
at
last
by
a
request
from
aunt
polly
that
there
might
be
no
further
intercourse
between
babington
and
folking
till
after
the
trial
caldigate
though
he
bore
all
this
with
an
assured
face
with
but
little
outward
sign
of
inward
misgiving
suffered
much
much
even
from
the
estrangement
of
those
with
whom
he
had
hitherto
been
familiar
to
be
by
any
one
was
a
pain
to
him
not
to
be
approved
of
not
to
be
courted
not
to
stand
well
in
the
eyes
of
those
around
him
was
to
him
positive
and
immediate
suffering
he
was
supported
no
doubt
by
the
full
confidence
of
his
father
by
the
friendliness
of
the
parson
and
by
the
energetic
assurances
of
partisans
who
were
all
on
his
side
such
as
ralph
holt
the
farmer
while
caldigate
had
been
in
cambridge
waiting
for
his
wife
escape
holt
and
one
or
two
others
were
maturing
a
plan
for
breaking
into
puritan
grange
and
restoring
the
wife
to
her
husband
all
this
supported
him
without
it
he
could
hardly
have
carried
himself
as
he
did
but
with
all
this
still
he
was
very
wretched
is
that
so
many
people
should
think
me
guilty
he
said
to
bromley
she
bore
it
better
though
of
course
now
that
she
was
safe
at
folking
she
had
but
little
to
do
as
to
outward
bearing
in
the
first
place
no
doubt
as
to
his
truth
ever
touched
her
for
a
moment
and
not
much
doubt
as
to
the
result
of
the
trial
it
was
to
her
an
assured
fact
that
john
caldigate
was
her
husband
and
she
could
not
realise
the
idea
that
such
being
the
fact
a
jury
should
say
that
he
was
not
but
let
all
that
be
as
it
might
they
two
were
one
and
to
adhere
to
him
in
every
word
in
every
thought
in
every
little
action
was
to
her
the
only
line
of
conduct
possible
she
heard
what
bromley
said
she
knew
what
her
thought
she
was
aware
of
the
enthusiasm
on
her
side
of
the
folk
at
folking
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
opposition
to
her
happiness
was
but
a
continuation
of
that
which
her
mother
had
always
made
to
her
marriage
the
boltons
were
all
against
her
it
was
a
terrible
sorrow
to
her
but
she
knew
how
to
bear
it
bravely
in
the
tenderness
of
her
husband
who
at
this
time
was
very
tender
to
her
she
had
her
great
consolation
on
the
day
of
her
return
she
had
been
very
ill
so
ill
that
caldigate
and
his
father
had
been
much
frightened
during
the
journey
home
in
the
carriage
she
had
wept
and
laughed
hysterically
now
clutching
her
baby
and
then
embracing
her
husband
before
reaching
folking
she
had
been
so
worn
with
fatigue
that
he
had
hardly
been
able
to
support
her
on
the
seat
but
after
rest
for
a
day
or
two
she
had
rallied
completely
and
she
herself
had
taken
pleasure
and
great
pride
in
the
fact
that
through
it
all
her
baby
had
never
really
been
is
a
little
man
she
said
boasting
to
the
boy
father
knows
how
to
put
up
with
troubles
and
when
his
mamma
was
so
bad
he
did
peak
and
pine
and
cry
so
as
to
break
her
heart
did
he
my
own
own
brave
little
man
and
she
could
boast
of
her
own
health
too
god
i
am
strong
john
i
can
bear
things
which
would
break
down
other
women
you
shall
never
see
me
give
way
because
i
am
a
poor
creature
certainly
she
had
a
right
to
boast
that
she
was
not
a
poor
creature
caldigate
no
doubt
was
subject
to
troubles
of
which
she
knew
nothing
it
was
quite
clear
to
him
that
seely
his
own
lawyer
did
in
truth
believe
that
there
had
been
some
form
of
marriage
between
him
and
euphemia
smith
the
attorney
had
never
said
so
much
had
never
accused
him
it
would
probably
have
been
opposed
to
all
the
proprieties
in
such
a
matter
that
any
direct
accusation
should
have
been
made
against
him
by
his
own
attorney
but
he
could
understand
from
the
man
manner
that
his
mind
was
not
free
from
a
strong
suspicion
seely
was
eager
enough
as
to
the
defence
but
seemed
to
be
eager
as
against
opposing
evidence
rather
than
on
the
strength
of
evidence
on
his
own
side
he
was
not
apparently
desirous
of
making
all
the
world
know
that
such
a
marriage
certainly
never
took
place
but
that
whether
such
a
marriage
had
taken
place
or
not
the
jury
ought
not
to
trust
the
witnesses
he
relied
not
on
the
strength
of
his
own
client
but
on
the
weakness
of
his
adversaries
it
might
probably
be
capable
of
proof
that
crinkett
and
adamson
and
the
woman
had
conspired
together
to
get
money
from
john
caldigate
and
if
so
then
their
evidence
as
to
the
marriage
would
be
much
weakened
and
he
showed
himself
not
averse
to
any
tricks
of
trade
which
might
tend
to
get
a
verdict
could
it
be
proved
that
john
crinkett
had
been
dishonest
in
his
mining
operations
had
euphemia
smith
allowed
her
name
to
be
connected
with
that
of
any
other
man
in
australia
what
had
been
her
antecedents
was
it
not
on
the
cards
that
allan
the
minister
had
never
undergone
any
ceremony
of
ordination
and
if
not
might
it
not
be
shown
that
a
marriage
service
performed
by
him
would
be
no
marriage
service
at
all
could
not
the
jury
be
made
to
think
or
at
least
some
of
the
jury
that
out
there
in
that
rough
lawless
wilderness
marriage
ceremonies
were
very
little
understood
these
were
the
wiles
to
which
he
seemed
disposed
to
trust
whereas
caldigate
was
anxious
that
he
should
instruct
some
eloquent
indignant
advocate
to
declare
boldly
that
no
english
gentleman
could
have
been
guilty
of
conduct
so
base
so
dastardly
and
so
cruel
see
caldigate
the
lawyer
said
on
one
occasion
make
the
best
of
it
our
own
hands
are
not
quite
clean
you
did
promise
the
other
lady
marriage
doubt
no
doubt
i
was
a
fool
and
i
paid
for
my
folly
i
bought
her
off
having
fallen
into
the
common
scrape
having
been
pleased
by
her
prettinesses
and
clevernesses
and
women
ways
i
did
as
so
many
other
men
have
done
i
got
out
of
it
as
best
i
could
without
treachery
and
without
dishonour
i
bought
her
off
had
she
refused
to
take
my
money
i
should
probably
have
married
her
and
probably
have
blown
my
brains
out
afterwards
all
that
has
to
be
acknowledged
much
to
my
shame
most
of
us
would
have
to
blush
if
the
worst
of
our
actions
were
brought
out
before
us
in
a
court
of
law
but
there
was
an
end
of
it
then
they
come
over
here
and
endeavour
to
enforce
their
demand
for
money
by
a
threat
envelope
is
so
unfortunate
said
the
lawyer
unfortunate
we
shall
get
some
one
before
the
day
comes
who
will
tell
the
jury
that
any
marriage
up
at
ahalala
must
have
been
a
farce
all
this
was
unsatisfactory
and
became
so
more
and
more
as
the
weeks
went
by
the
confidential
clerk
whom
the
boltons
had
sent
out
when
the
first
threat
reached
them
early
in
november
the
threat
conveyed
in
that
letter
from
the
woman
which
caldigate
had
shown
to
robert
bolton
returned
about
the
end
of
march
the
two
brothers
robert
and
william
decided
upon
sending
him
to
seely
so
that
any
information
obtained
might
be
at
caldigate
command
to
be
used
if
of
any
use
in
his
defence
but
there
was
in
truth
very
little
of
it
the
clerk
had
been
up
to
nobble
and
ahalala
and
had
found
no
one
there
who
knew
enough
of
the
matter
to
give
evidence
about
it
the
population
of
mining
districts
in
australia
is
peculiarly
a
shifting
population
so
that
the
most
of
those
who
had
known
caldigate
and
his
mode
of
life
there
were
gone
the
old
woman
who
kept
henniker
hotel
at
nobble
had
certainly
heard
that
they
were
married
but
then
she
had
added
that
many
people
there
called
themselves
man
and
wife
from
convenience
a
woman
would
often
like
a
respectable
name
where
there
was
no
parson
near
at
hand
to
entitle
her
to
it
then
the
parsons
would
be
dilatory
and
troublesome
and
expensive
and
a
good
many
people
were
apt
to
think
that
they
could
do
very
well
without
ceremonies
she
evidently
would
have
done
no
good
to
either
side
as
a
witness
this
clerk
had
found
ahalala
almost
deserted
occupied
chiefly
by
a
few
chinese
who
were
contented
to
search
for
the
specks
of
gold
which
more
ambitious
miners
had
allowed
to
slip
through
their
fingers
the
woman
had
certainly
called
herself
caldigate
and
had
been
called
so
by
many
but
she
had
afterwards
been
called
crinkett
when
she
and
crinkett
had
combined
their
means
with
the
view
of
buying
the
polyeuka
mine
she
was
described
as
an
enterprising
greedy
woman
upon
whom
the
love
of
gold
had
had
almost
more
than
its
customary
effect
and
she
had
for
a
while
been
noted
and
courted
for
her
success
having
been
the
only
female
miner
who
was
supposed
to
have
realised
money
in
these
parts
she
had
been
known
to
the
banks
at
nobble
also
even
at
sydney
and
had
been
supposed
at
one
time
to
have
been
worth
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
then
she
had
joined
herself
with
crinkett
and
all
their
money
had
been
supposed
to
vanish
in
the
polyeuka
mine
no
doubt
there
had
been
enough
in
that
to
create
animosity
of
the
most
bitter
kind
against
caldigate
he
in
his
search
for
gold
had
been
uniformly
successful
was
spoken
of
among
the
nobble
miners
as
the
one
man
who
in
had
never
had
a
reverse
he
had
gone
away
just
before
the
bad
time
came
on
polyeuka
and
then
had
succeeded
after
he
had
gone
in
extracting
from
these
late
unfortunate
partners
of
his
every
farthing
that
he
had
left
them
there
was
ample
cause
for
animosity
allan
the
minister
who
certainly
had
been
at
ahalala
was
as
certainly
dead
he
had
gone
out
from
scotland
as
a
presbyterian
clergyman
and
no
doubt
had
ever
been
felt
as
to
his
being
that
which
he
called
himself
and
a
letter
from
him
was
produced
which
had
undoubtedly
been
written
by
himself
robert
bolton
had
procured
a
photograph
of
the
note
which
the
woman
produced
as
having
been
written
by
allan
to
caldigate
the
handwriting
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
the
same
but
an
expert
had
given
an
opinion
that
they
both
might
have
been
written
by
the
same
person
of
dick
shand
no
tidings
had
been
found
it
was
believed
that
he
had
gone
from
queensland
to
some
of
the
islands
probably
to
the
fijis
but
he
had
sunk
so
low
among
men
as
to
have
left
no
trace
behind
him
in
australia
no
one
cares
to
know
whence
a
shepherd
has
come
or
whither
he
goes
a
miner
belongs
to
a
higher
class
and
is
more
considered
the
result
of
all
which
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
boltons
adverse
to
john
caldigate
and
in
discussing
this
with
his
client
seely
acknowledged
that
nothing
had
as
yet
come
to
light
sufficient
to
shake
the
direct
testimony
of
the
woman
corroborated
as
it
was
by
three
persons
all
of
whom
would
swear
that
they
had
been
present
at
the
marriage
doubt
they
endeavoured
to
get
money
from
you
said
seely
i
may
be
well
assured
in
my
own
mind
that
money
was
their
sole
object
but
then
it
can
not
be
denied
that
their
application
to
you
for
money
had
a
sound
basis
one
which
though
you
might
fairly
refuse
to
allow
it
takes
away
from
the
application
all
idea
of
criminality
crinkett
has
never
asked
for
money
as
a
bribe
to
hold
his
tongue
in
a
matter
of
trade
between
them
and
you
you
were
very
successful
they
were
very
unfortunate
a
man
asking
for
restitution
in
such
circumstances
will
hardly
be
regarded
as
dishonest
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
caldigate
declared
that
he
would
willingly
have
remitted
a
portion
of
the
money
had
he
known
the
true
circumstances
he
had
not
done
so
and
now
the
accusation
was
made
the
jury
feeling
that
the
application
had
been
justifiable
would
probably
keep
the
two
things
distinct
that
was
seely
view
and
thus
in
these
days
caldigate
gradually
came
to
hate
seely
there
was
no
comfort
to
be
had
from
seely
bromley
was
much
more
comfortable
though
unfortunately
in
such
a
matter
less
to
be
trusted
to
the
minister
handwriting
he
said
will
go
for
nothing
even
if
he
had
written
the
note
he
did
said
caldigate
but
should
it
be
believed
to
have
been
his
it
would
prove
nothing
and
as
to
the
envelope
i
can
not
think
that
any
jury
would
disturb
the
happiness
of
a
family
on
such
evidence
as
that
it
all
depends
on
the
credibility
of
the
people
who
swear
that
they
were
present
and
i
can
only
say
that
were
i
one
of
the
jury
and
were
the
case
brought
before
me
as
i
see
it
now
i
certainly
should
not
believe
them
there
is
here
one
letter
to
you
declaring
that
if
you
will
comply
with
her
demands
she
will
not
annoy
you
and
declaring
also
her
purpose
of
marrying
some
one
else
how
can
any
juryman
believe
her
after
that
seely
says
that
twelve
men
will
not
be
less
likely
to
think
me
a
bigamist
because
she
has
expressed
her
readiness
to
commit
bigamy
that
if
alone
she
would
not
have
a
leg
to
stand
upon
but
that
she
is
amply
corroborated
whereas
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
witness
to
support
me
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
way
any
man
might
be
made
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
then
bromley
said
that
all
that
would
be
too
patent
to
a
jury
to
leave
any
doubt
upon
the
matter
but
john
caldigate
himself
though
he
took
great
comfort
in
the
society
of
the
clergyman
did
in
truth
rely
rather
on
the
opinion
of
the
lawyer
the
old
squire
never
doubted
his
son
for
a
moment
and
in
his
intercourse
with
hester
showed
her
all
the
tenderness
and
trust
of
a
loving
parent
but
he
too
manifestly
feared
the
verdict
of
a
jury
according
to
him
things
in
the
world
around
him
generally
were
very
bad
what
was
to
be
expected
from
an
ordinary
jury
such
as
cambridgeshire
would
supply
but
prejudice
stupidity
or
at
the
best
a
strict
obedience
to
the
dictum
of
a
judge
is
a
case
he
said
which
no
jury
about
here
will
have
sense
enough
to
understand
and
weigh
the
facts
there
will
be
on
one
side
the
evidence
of
four
people
all
swearing
the
same
thing
it
may
be
that
one
or
more
of
them
will
break
down
under
and
that
all
will
then
be
straight
but
if
not
the
twelve
men
in
a
box
will
believe
them
because
they
are
four
not
understanding
that
in
such
a
case
four
may
conspire
as
easily
as
two
or
three
there
will
be
the
judge
no
doubt
but
english
judges
are
always
favourable
to
convictions
the
judge
begins
with
the
idea
that
the
man
before
him
would
hardly
have
been
brought
there
had
he
not
been
guilty
in
all
this
and
very
much
more
that
he
said
both
to
bromley
and
his
son
he
was
expressing
his
contempt
for
the
world
around
him
rather
than
any
opinion
of
his
own
on
this
particular
matter
often
think
said
he
we
have
to
bear
more
from
the
stupidity
than
from
the
wickedness
of
the
world
it
should
be
mentioned
that
about
a
week
after
hester
escape
from
chesterton
there
came
to
her
a
letter
from
her
mother
hester
you
do
not
think
that
i
do
not
love
you
because
i
tried
to
protect
you
from
what
i
believe
to
be
sin
and
evil
and
temptation
you
do
not
think
that
i
am
less
your
mother
because
i
caused
you
suffering
if
your
eye
offend
you
pluck
it
out
was
i
not
plucking
out
my
own
eye
when
i
caused
pain
to
you
you
ought
to
come
back
to
me
and
your
father
you
ought
to
do
so
even
now
but
whether
you
come
back
or
not
will
you
not
remember
that
i
am
the
mother
who
bore
you
and
have
always
loved
you
and
when
further
distress
shall
come
upon
you
will
you
not
return
to
me
your
unhappy
but
most
loving
mother
bolton
in
answer
to
this
hester
in
a
long
letter
acknowledged
her
love
and
said
that
the
memory
of
those
two
days
at
chesterton
should
lessen
neither
her
affection
nor
her
filial
duty
but
she
went
on
to
say
that
in
whatever
distress
might
come
upon
her
she
should
turn
to
her
husband
for
comfort
and
support
whether
he
should
be
with
her
or
whether
he
should
be
away
from
her
she
added
concluding
her
letter
my
husband
and
my
child
you
and
papa
will
always
be
the
dearest
to
me
chapter
xxxviii
bollum
there
was
not
much
to
enliven
the
house
at
folking
during
these
days
caldigate
would
pass
much
of
his
time
walking
about
the
place
applying
his
mind
as
well
as
he
could
to
the
farm
and
holding
up
his
head
among
the
tenants
with
whom
he
was
very
popular
he
had
begun
his
reign
over
them
with
hands
not
only
full
but
free
he
had
drained
and
roofed
and
put
up
gates
and
repaired
roads
and
shown
himself
to
be
an
active
man
anxious
to
do
good
and
now
in
his
trouble
they
were
very
true
to
him
but
their
sympathy
could
not
ease
the
burden
at
his
heart
though
by
his
words
and
deeds
among
them
he
seemed
to
occupy
himself
fully
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
pretence
in
every
effort
that
he
made
he
was
always
affecting
a
courage
in
which
he
felt
himself
to
be
deficient
every
smile
was
false
every
brave
word
spoken
was
an
attempt
at
deceit
when
alone
in
his
walks
and
he
was
mostly
alone
his
mind
would
fix
itself
on
his
great
trouble
and
on
the
crushing
sorrow
which
might
only
too
probably
fall
upon
that
loved
one
whom
he
had
called
his
wife
oh
with
what
regret
now
did
he
think
of
the
good
advice
which
the
captain
had
given
him
on
board
the
goldfinder
and
of
the
sententious
timid
wisdom
of
callender
had
she
his
hester
ever
uttered
to
him
one
word
of
reproach
had
she
ever
shuddered
in
his
sight
when
he
had
acknowledged
that
the
now
odious
woman
had
in
that
distant
land
been
in
his
own
hearing
called
by
his
own
name
it
would
have
been
almost
better
her
absolute
faith
added
a
sting
to
his
sufferings
then
as
he
walked
alone
about
the
estate
he
would
endeavour
to
think
whether
there
might
not
yet
be
some
mode
of
escape
whether
something
might
not
be
done
to
prevent
his
having
to
stand
in
the
dock
and
abide
the
uncertain
verdict
of
a
jury
with
seely
he
was
discontented
seely
seemed
to
be
opposed
to
any
great
effort
would
simply
trust
to
the
chance
of
snatching
little
advantages
in
the
court
he
had
money
at
command
if
fifty
thousand
pounds
if
double
that
sum
would
have
freed
him
from
this
trouble
he
thought
that
he
could
have
raised
it
and
was
sure
that
he
would
willingly
pay
it
twenty
thousand
pounds
two
months
since
when
crinkett
appeared
at
the
christening
would
have
sent
these
people
away
the
same
sum
no
doubt
would
send
them
away
now
but
then
the
arrangement
might
have
been
possible
but
now
how
was
it
now
could
it
still
be
done
then
the
whole
thing
might
have
been
hidden
buried
in
darkness
now
it
was
already
in
the
mouths
of
all
men
but
still
if
these
witnesses
were
made
to
disappear
if
this
woman
herself
by
whom
the
charge
was
made
would
take
herself
away
then
the
trial
must
be
abandoned
there
would
be
a
whispering
of
evil
or
too
probably
the
saying
of
evil
without
whispering
a
terrible
injury
would
have
been
inflicted
upon
her
and
his
boy
but
the
injury
would
be
less
than
that
which
he
now
feared
and
there
was
present
to
him
through
all
this
a
feeling
that
the
money
ought
to
be
paid
independently
of
the
accusation
brought
against
him
had
he
known
at
first
all
that
he
knew
now
how
he
had
taken
their
all
from
these
people
and
how
they
had
failed
absolutely
in
the
last
great
venture
they
had
made
he
would
certainly
have
shared
their
loss
with
them
he
would
have
done
all
that
crinkett
had
suggested
to
him
when
he
and
crinkett
were
walking
along
the
dike
crinkett
had
said
that
on
receiving
twenty
thousand
pounds
he
would
have
gone
back
to
australia
and
would
have
taken
a
wife
with
him
that
offer
had
been
quite
intelligible
and
if
carried
out
would
have
put
an
end
to
all
trouble
but
he
had
mismanaged
that
interview
he
had
been
too
proud
too
desirous
not
to
seem
to
buy
off
a
threatening
enemy
now
as
the
trouble
pressed
itself
more
closely
upon
him
upon
him
and
his
hester
he
would
so
willingly
buy
off
his
enemy
if
it
were
possible
ought
to
have
the
money
he
said
to
himself
only
i
could
contrive
that
it
should
be
paid
to
them
one
day
as
he
was
entering
the
house
by
a
side
door
darvell
the
gardener
told
him
that
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
to
see
him
the
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
and
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sit
down
darvell
when
asked
whether
the
gentleman
was
a
gentleman
expressed
an
affirmative
opinion
he
had
been
driven
over
from
cambridge
in
a
hired
gig
which
was
now
standing
in
the
yard
and
was
dressed
as
darvell
expressed
it
accordingly
and
genteel
so
caldigate
passed
into
the
house
and
found
the
man
seated
in
the
you
will
step
into
my
study
said
caldigate
thus
the
two
men
were
seated
together
in
the
little
room
which
caldigate
used
for
his
own
purposes
caldigate
as
he
looked
at
the
man
distrusted
his
gardener
judgment
the
coat
and
hat
and
gloves
even
the
whiskers
and
head
of
hair
might
have
belonged
to
a
gentleman
but
not
as
he
thought
the
mouth
or
the
eyes
or
the
hands
and
when
the
man
began
to
speak
there
was
a
mixture
of
assurance
and
intended
complaisance
an
effected
familiarity
and
an
attempt
at
ease
which
made
the
master
of
the
house
quite
sure
that
his
guest
was
not
all
that
darvell
had
represented
the
man
soon
told
his
story
his
name
was
bollum
richard
bollum
and
he
had
connections
with
australia
was
largely
concerned
in
australian
when
caldigate
heard
this
he
looked
round
involuntarily
to
see
whether
the
door
was
closed
tiled
of
course
said
bollum
caldigate
with
a
frown
nodded
his
head
and
bollum
went
on
he
had
come
there
he
said
to
speak
of
some
recent
troubles
of
which
he
had
heard
he
was
the
man
to
shove
his
nose
into
other
people
matters
it
was
nothing
to
him
who
was
married
to
whom
caldigate
shivered
but
sat
and
listened
in
silence
but
bollum
had
had
dealings
many
dealings
with
timothy
crinkett
indeed
he
was
ready
to
say
that
timothy
crinkett
was
his
uncle
he
was
not
particularly
proud
of
his
uncle
but
nevertheless
timothy
crinkett
was
his
uncle
did
caldigate
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done
for
timothy
crinkett
i
do
said
caldigate
finding
himself
compelled
to
say
something
at
the
moment
and
feeling
that
he
could
say
so
much
with
positive
truth
then
bollum
continued
his
story
showing
that
he
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
polyeuka
was
hard
on
them
was
it
mr
caldigate
think
it
was
rap
they
had
among
them
caldigate
you
left
them
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
was
not
my
doing
i
simply
made
him
an
offer
which
every
one
at
the
time
believed
to
be
liberal
so
we
grants
all
that
but
still
you
got
all
their
money
old
pals
of
yours
too
as
they
say
out
there
is
a
matter
of
most
intense
regret
to
me
as
soon
as
i
knew
the
circumstances
bollum
i
should
have
been
most
happy
to
have
divided
the
loss
with
them
it
that
it
that
what
be
right
between
man
and
man
said
bollum
interrupting
him
no
other
subject
been
introduced
know
nothing
about
other
subjects
i
have
come
here
to
meddle
with
other
subjects
i
as
it
were
a
partner
of
crinkett
any
way
i
am
acting
as
his
agent
i
quite
above
board
caldigate
and
in
what
i
say
i
mean
to
stick
to
my
own
business
and
not
go
beyond
it
twenty
thousand
pounds
is
what
we
ask
so
that
we
and
you
may
share
the
loss
you
agree
to
that
should
have
agreed
to
it
two
months
since
said
caldigate
fearing
that
he
might
be
caught
in
a
trap
anxious
to
do
nothing
mean
unfair
or
contrary
to
the
law
craving
in
his
heart
after
the
bold
upright
conduct
of
a
thoroughly
honourable
english
gentleman
and
yet
desirous
also
to
use
if
it
might
be
used
the
instrumentality
of
this
man
why
not
now
you
see
said
bollum
becoming
a
little
more
confidential
difficult
it
is
for
me
to
speak
things
altered
you
got
the
money
they
lost
the
money
there
is
any
caldigate
as
for
crinkett
he
a
rough
diamond
of
course
what
am
i
to
say
about
the
lady
do
see
that
you
need
say
anything
just
it
of
course
she
one
of
them
that
all
if
there
is
to
be
money
she
have
her
share
he
an
old
fool
and
perhaps
make
a
match
of
it
as
he
said
this
he
winked
any
rate
they
be
off
to
australia
together
and
what
i
propose
is
this
caldigate
then
he
paused
do
you
propose
the
money
payable
in
bills
to
their
joint
order
at
sydney
they
do
want
to
be
wasting
any
more
time
here
they
start
at
once
this
is
the
april
is
it
tuesday
the
caldigate
assented
old
goldfinder
leaves
plymouth
this
day
week
from
this
he
was
sure
that
bollum
had
heard
all
the
story
from
euphemia
smith
herself
or
he
would
not
have
talked
of
the
goldfinder
them
have
the
bills
handed
to
them
on
board
and
they
go
let
me
have
the
duplicates
here
you
can
remit
the
money
by
july
to
your
agents
to
take
up
the
bills
when
due
just
let
me
be
with
you
when
the
order
is
given
to
your
banker
in
london
and
everything
will
be
done
it
as
easy
as
kiss
caldigate
sat
silent
turning
it
over
in
his
own
mind
trying
to
determine
what
would
be
best
here
was
another
opportunity
but
it
was
one
as
to
which
he
must
come
to
a
decision
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
must
deal
with
the
man
now
or
never
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
were
nothing
had
there
been
no
question
about
his
wife
he
would
have
paid
the
money
moved
by
that
argument
as
to
his
pals
by
the
conviction
that
the
result
of
his
dealing
with
them
had
in
truth
been
to
leave
them
bare
as
the
palm
of
his
hand
they
were
welcome
to
the
money
and
if
by
giving
the
money
he
could
save
his
hester
how
great
a
thing
it
would
be
was
it
not
his
duty
to
make
the
attempt
and
yet
there
was
in
his
bosom
a
strong
aversion
to
have
any
secret
dealing
with
such
a
man
as
this
to
have
any
secret
dealing
in
such
a
matter
to
buy
off
witnesses
in
order
that
his
wife
name
and
his
boy
legitimacy
might
be
half
only
half
established
for
even
though
these
people
should
be
made
absolutely
to
vanish
though
the
sea
should
swallow
them
all
that
had
been
said
would
be
known
and
too
probably
believed
for
ever
and
then
too
he
was
afraid
if
he
did
this
thing
alone
without
counsel
would
he
not
be
putting
himself
into
the
hands
of
these
wretches
might
he
not
be
almost
sure
that
when
they
had
gotten
his
money
they
would
turn
upon
him
and
demand
more
would
not
the
payment
of
the
money
be
evidence
against
him
to
any
jury
would
it
be
possible
to
make
judge
or
jury
believe
to
make
even
a
friend
believe
that
in
such
an
emergency
he
had
paid
away
so
large
a
sum
of
money
because
he
had
felt
himself
bound
to
do
so
by
his
conscience
squire
said
bollum
think
you
see
your
way
through
it
you
do
regard
the
money
in
the
least
they
would
be
welcome
to
the
money
a
great
point
anyway
but
you
afraid
they
would
go
you
come
down
to
plymouth
and
do
put
the
bills
into
their
hands
or
mine
till
the
vessel
is
under
weigh
with
them
aboard
then
you
and
i
will
step
into
the
boat
and
be
back
ashore
when
they
know
the
money
been
deposited
at
a
bank
in
london
they
trust
you
as
far
as
that
the
goldfinder
wo
put
back
again
when
she
once
off
wo
that
make
it
square
was
thinking
of
something
else
yes
there
that
trial
on
is
there
people
have
conspired
together
to
tell
the
basest
lie
know
nothing
about
that
caldigate
i
have
got
so
much
as
an
opinion
people
tell
me
that
all
the
things
look
very
strong
on
their
side
sometimes
are
successful
can
be
quit
of
them
and
pay
no
more
than
what
you
say
you
kind
of
owes
i
should
have
thought
crinkett
might
have
asked
forty
thousand
but
crinkett
though
he
rough
i
do
own
he
rough
but
he
honest
after
a
fashion
crinkett
wants
to
rob
no
man
but
he
feels
it
hard
when
he
got
the
better
of
lies
or
no
lies
can
you
do
better
should
like
to
see
my
lawyer
first
said
caldigate
almost
panting
in
his
anxiety
lawyer
i
hate
lawyers
seely
my
case
is
in
his
hands
and
i
should
have
to
tell
him
him
when
you
come
back
from
plymouth
and
hold
your
peace
till
that
done
no
good
can
come
of
lawyers
in
such
a
matter
as
this
you
might
as
well
tell
the
why
should
he
want
to
put
bread
out
of
his
own
mouth
and
if
there
is
a
chance
of
hard
words
being
said
why
should
he
hear
them
he
work
for
his
money
no
doubt
but
what
odds
is
it
to
him
whether
your
lady
is
to
be
called
caldigate
or
miss
bolton
he
wo
have
to
go
to
prison
his
boy
wo
be
you
know
what
this
was
terrible
but
yet
it
was
all
so
true
tell
you
what
it
is
squire
we
ca
make
it
lighter
by
talking
about
it
all
round
i
used
to
do
a
bit
of
hunting
once
and
i
never
knew
any
good
come
of
asking
what
there
was
the
other
side
of
the
fence
you
got
to
have
it
or
you
got
to
leave
it
alone
that
just
where
you
are
of
course
it
is
nice
do
mind
the
money
so
but
it
is
nice
for
a
swell
like
you
to
have
to
hand
it
over
to
such
a
one
as
crinkett
just
as
the
ship
starting
and
then
to
bolt
ashore
along
with
me
the
odds
are
it
is
all
talked
about
let
own
all
that
but
then
it
not
nice
to
have
to
hear
a
woman
swear
that
she
your
wife
when
you
got
another
specially
when
she
got
three
men
as
can
swear
the
same
it
ai
nice
for
you
to
have
me
sitting
here
i
well
aware
of
that
there
the
choice
of
evils
you
know
what
that
means
i
it
about
as
fair
as
a
man
can
put
anything
it
a
pity
you
did
stump
up
the
money
before
but
it
not
altogether
quite
too
late
yet
give
you
an
answer
mr
bollum
must
be
in
town
will
be
with
you
in
london
if
you
will
give
me
an
address
all
that
you
have
said
is
true
but
i
can
not
do
this
thing
without
thinking
of
it
come
alone
alone
a
gentleman
my
word
as
a
gentleman
i
will
come
alone
then
bollum
gave
him
an
address
not
the
place
at
which
he
resided
but
a
certain
in
the
city
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
make
appointments
do
you
see
any
lawyer
said
bollum
shaking
his
finger
ca
do
any
good
that
way
it
stands
to
reason
that
no
lawyer
would
let
you
pay
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
get
out
of
any
scrape
he
and
you
have
different
legs
to
stand
upon
then
bollum
went
away
and
was
driven
back
in
his
gig
to
the
cambridge
hotel
as
soon
as
the
front
door
was
closed
hester
hurried
down
to
her
husband
whom
she
found
still
in
the
hall
he
took
her
into
his
own
room
and
told
her
everything
that
had
passed
everything
as
accurately
as
he
could
remember
he
said
i
do
not
owe
them
money
that
i
feel
bound
by
my
conscience
to
refund
them
so
much
i
should
do
it
now
i
know
the
circumstances
if
no
charge
had
been
brought
against
me
have
perjured
themselves
and
have
been
so
wicked
they
have
been
very
wicked
them
come
and
speak
the
truth
and
then
let
them
have
the
money
will
not
do
that
hester
them
to
be
liars
and
then
give
it
to
them
own
girl
i
am
thinking
of
you
i
of
you
shall
it
be
said
of
you
that
you
bought
off
those
who
had
dared
to
say
that
your
wife
was
not
your
wife
i
would
not
do
that
what
if
the
people
in
the
court
should
believe
what
they
say
would
be
bad
for
you
then
dearest
i
should
still
be
your
wife
and
baby
would
still
be
your
own
own
honest
boy
i
am
sometimes
unhappy
but
i
am
never
afraid
let
the
devil
do
his
worst
but
never
speak
him
fair
i
would
scorn
them
till
it
is
all
over
then
if
money
be
due
to
them
let
them
have
it
as
she
said
this
she
had
drawn
herself
a
little
apart
from
him
a
little
away
from
the
arm
which
had
been
round
her
waist
and
was
looking
him
full
in
the
face
never
before
even
during
the
soft
happiness
of
their
bridal
tour
had
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
so
handsome
but
her
faith
her
courage
and
her
beauty
did
not
alter
the
circumstances
of
the
case
because
she
trusted
him
he
was
not
the
less
afraid
of
the
jury
who
would
have
to
decide
or
of
the
judge
who
with
stern
eyes
would
probably
find
himself
compelled
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
evidence
against
the
prisoner
was
overwhelming
in
choosing
what
might
be
best
to
be
done
on
her
account
he
could
not
allow
himself
to
be
guided
by
her
spirit
the
possibility
that
the
whole
gang
of
them
might
be
made
to
vanish
was
present
to
his
mind
nor
could
he
satisfy
himself
that
in
doing
as
had
been
proposed
to
him
he
would
be
speaking
the
devil
fair
he
would
be
paying
money
which
he
ought
to
pay
and
would
perhaps
be
securing
his
wife
happiness
he
had
promised
at
any
rate
that
he
would
see
the
man
in
london
on
the
morrow
and
that
he
would
see
him
alone
but
he
had
not
promised
not
to
speak
on
the
subject
to
his
attorney
therefore
after
much
thought
he
wrote
to
seely
to
make
an
appointment
for
the
next
morning
and
then
told
his
wife
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
london
on
the
following
day
to
buy
those
men
off
she
said
is
done
will
be
done
by
the
advice
of
my
lawyer
he
said
peevishly
may
be
sure
that
i
am
anxious
enough
to
do
the
best
when
one
has
to
trust
to
a
lawyer
one
is
bound
to
trust
to
him
this
seemed
to
be
so
true
that
hester
could
say
nothing
against
it
chapter
xxxix
restitution
he
had
still
the
whole
night
to
think
about
it
and
throughout
the
whole
night
he
was
thinking
about
it
he
had
fixed
a
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
for
his
appointment
in
london
so
that
he
might
have
an
hour
or
two
in
cambridge
before
he
started
by
the
train
it
was
during
his
drive
into
the
town
that
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
satisfy
himself
with
discussing
the
matter
with
seely
but
that
he
would
endeavour
to
explain
it
all
to
robert
bolton
no
doubt
robert
bolton
was
now
his
enemy
as
were
all
the
boltons
but
the
brother
could
not
but
be
anxious
for
his
sister
name
and
his
happiness
if
a
way
out
of
all
this
misery
could
be
seen
it
would
be
a
way
out
of
misery
for
the
boltons
as
well
as
for
the
caldigates
if
only
he
could
make
the
attorney
believe
that
hester
was
in
truth
his
wife
still
even
yet
there
might
be
assistance
on
that
side
but
he
went
to
seely
first
the
hour
of
his
appointment
requiring
that
it
should
be
so
but
seely
was
altogether
opposed
to
any
arrangement
with
bollum
good
was
ever
done
he
said
buying
off
witnesses
the
thing
itself
is
disreputable
and
would
to
a
certainty
be
known
to
every
one
should
not
buy
them
off
i
regard
the
money
as
their
own
i
will
give
crinkett
the
money
and
let
him
go
or
stay
as
he
pleases
when
giving
him
the
money
i
will
tell
him
that
he
may
do
as
he
pleases
would
only
throw
your
money
away
you
would
do
much
worse
than
throw
it
away
their
absence
would
not
prevent
the
trial
the
boltons
will
take
care
of
that
can
not
want
to
injure
their
own
side
mr
seely
want
to
punish
you
and
to
take
her
away
they
will
take
care
that
the
trial
shall
go
on
and
when
it
was
proved
as
it
would
be
proved
that
you
had
given
these
people
a
large
sum
of
money
and
had
so
secured
their
absence
do
you
think
that
the
jury
would
refuse
to
believe
their
sworn
depositions
and
whatever
other
evidence
would
remain
the
fact
of
your
having
paid
them
money
would
secure
a
verdict
against
you
the
thing
would
in
my
mind
be
so
disreputable
that
i
should
have
to
throw
up
the
case
i
could
not
defend
you
it
was
clear
to
him
that
bollum
had
understood
his
own
side
of
the
question
in
deprecating
any
reference
to
an
attorney
the
money
should
have
been
paid
and
the
four
witnesses
sent
away
without
a
word
to
any
one
if
any
attempt
in
that
direction
were
made
at
all
nevertheless
he
went
to
robert
bolton
office
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
interview
with
his
wife
brother
but
here
as
with
the
other
attorney
he
failed
to
make
the
man
understand
the
state
of
his
own
mind
he
had
failed
in
the
same
way
even
with
his
wife
if
it
were
fit
that
the
money
should
be
paid
it
could
not
be
right
that
he
should
retain
it
because
the
people
to
whom
it
was
due
had
told
lies
about
him
and
if
this
could
be
explained
to
the
jury
surely
the
jury
would
not
give
a
verdict
against
him
on
insufficient
evidence
simply
because
he
had
done
his
duty
in
paying
the
money
robert
bolton
listened
to
him
with
patience
and
without
any
quick
expression
of
hot
anger
though
before
the
interview
was
over
he
had
used
some
very
cruel
words
should
think
ourselves
bound
to
prevent
their
going
if
possible
course
i
have
no
idea
of
going
down
to
plymouth
as
the
man
proposed
or
of
taking
any
steps
to
secure
their
absence
money
is
your
own
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
it
it
certainly
is
not
for
me
to
advise
you
if
you
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
pay
it
i
can
only
say
that
i
shall
look
very
sharp
after
them
should
you
want
to
ruin
your
sister
have
ruined
her
that
is
our
idea
we
desire
now
to
rescue
her
as
far
as
we
can
from
further
evil
you
have
opposed
us
in
every
endeavour
that
we
have
made
when
in
the
performance
of
a
manifest
duty
we
endeavoured
to
separate
you
till
after
the
trial
you
succeeded
in
thwarting
us
by
your
influence
left
it
to
her
you
been
true
and
honest
and
upright
you
would
have
known
that
as
long
as
there
was
a
doubt
she
ought
to
have
been
away
from
you
should
have
sent
her
away
as
to
create
a
doubt
in
her
mind
so
as
to
disturb
her
peace
so
as
to
make
her
think
that
i
having
been
found
out
was
willing
to
be
rid
of
her
it
would
have
killed
her
so
than
this
yet
i
am
as
truly
her
husband
as
you
are
the
husband
of
your
wife
if
you
would
only
teach
yourself
to
think
that
possible
then
you
would
feel
differently
as
to
a
temporary
separation
you
believed
me
you
would
said
caldigate
i
do
not
believe
you
in
a
matter
like
this
as
you
will
come
to
me
i
must
be
plain
i
do
not
believe
you
i
think
that
you
have
betrayed
and
seduced
my
sister
looking
at
all
the
evidence
and
at
your
own
confession
i
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
i
have
discussed
the
matter
with
my
brother
who
is
a
clear
most
judicious
man
and
he
is
of
the
same
opinion
in
our
own
private
court
we
have
brought
you
in
guilty
guilty
of
an
offence
against
us
all
which
necessarily
makes
us
as
bitter
against
you
as
one
man
can
be
against
another
you
have
destroyed
our
sister
and
now
you
come
here
and
ask
me
my
advice
as
to
buying
off
witnesses
is
all
untrue
as
there
is
a
god
above
me
i
am
her
loyal
loving
husband
i
will
buy
off
no
witness
i
were
you
i
would
make
no
such
attempt
it
will
do
no
good
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
a
chance
of
being
acquitted
not
a
chance
and
then
how
much
worse
it
will
be
for
hester
when
she
finds
herself
still
in
your
house
will
remain
there
she
will
feel
that
to
be
impossible
your
influence
will
then
probably
be
removed
and
i
presume
that
for
a
time
you
will
have
no
home
but
we
need
not
discuss
that
as
you
are
here
i
should
not
do
my
duty
were
i
not
to
assure
you
that
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
family
nothing
shall
be
spared
either
in
trouble
or
money
to
insure
the
conviction
and
punishment
of
the
man
whom
we
believe
to
have
brought
upon
us
so
terrible
a
disgrace
caldigate
when
he
got
out
into
the
street
felt
that
he
was
driven
almost
to
despair
at
first
he
declared
to
himself
most
untruly
that
there
was
no
one
to
believe
him
no
not
one
then
he
remembered
how
faithful
was
his
wife
and
as
he
did
so
in
his
misery
he
told
himself
that
it
might
have
been
better
for
her
had
she
been
less
faithful
looking
at
it
all
as
he
now
looked
at
it
after
hearing
the
words
of
that
hard
man
he
almost
thought
that
it
would
have
been
so
everybody
told
him
that
he
would
be
condemned
and
if
so
what
would
be
the
fate
of
that
poor
young
mother
and
her
child
it
was
very
well
for
her
to
declare
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
that
even
should
he
be
dragged
away
to
prison
she
would
still
be
his
true
wife
and
that
she
would
wait
in
sorrow
indeed
and
mourning
but
still
with
patience
till
the
cruel
jailers
and
the
harsh
laws
had
restored
him
to
her
if
the
law
declared
him
a
bigamist
she
could
not
then
be
his
wife
the
law
must
decide
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
still
must
decide
and
then
how
could
they
live
together
an
evil
done
must
be
endured
let
it
be
ever
so
unendurable
but
against
fresh
evils
a
man
may
guard
was
it
not
his
duty
his
manifest
his
chief
duty
to
save
her
as
far
as
she
could
be
saved
from
further
suffering
and
increased
disgrace
perhaps
after
all
robert
bolton
was
right
when
he
told
him
that
he
ought
to
have
allowed
hester
to
remain
at
chesterton
whatever
he
might
do
when
he
got
to
london
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
go
up
and
keep
his
appointment
with
bollum
and
he
brought
with
him
from
home
securities
and
certificates
for
stock
by
which
he
knew
that
he
could
raise
the
sum
named
at
a
moment
warning
should
he
at
last
decide
upon
paying
the
money
when
he
got
into
the
train
and
when
he
got
out
of
the
train
he
was
still
in
doubt
those
to
whom
he
had
gone
for
advice
had
been
so
hard
to
him
that
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
put
on
one
side
all
that
they
had
said
bollum
had
suggested
in
his
graphic
manner
that
a
lawyer
and
his
client
stood
upon
different
legs
caldigate
acknowledged
to
himself
that
bollum
was
right
his
own
lawyer
had
been
almost
as
hard
to
him
as
his
who
was
his
declared
enemy
but
what
should
he
do
as
to
precautions
to
be
taken
in
reference
to
the
departure
of
the
gang
all
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
they
should
go
to
australia
or
stay
behind
as
they
pleased
there
should
be
no
understanding
that
they
were
to
go
or
even
that
they
were
to
hold
their
tongues
because
the
money
was
paid
to
them
it
should
be
fully
explained
to
them
that
the
two
things
were
distinct
then
as
he
was
taken
to
the
inn
at
which
he
intended
to
sleep
that
night
he
made
up
his
mind
in
the
cab
that
he
would
pay
the
money
to
crinkett
he
got
to
london
just
in
time
to
reach
the
bank
before
it
was
closed
and
there
made
his
arrangements
he
deposited
his
documents
and
securities
and
was
assured
that
the
necessary
sum
should
be
placed
to
his
credit
on
the
following
day
then
he
walked
across
a
street
or
two
in
the
city
to
the
place
indicated
by
bollum
for
the
appointment
it
was
at
the
jericho
coffee
house
in
levant
court
a
silent
secluded
spot
lying
between
lombard
street
and
cornhill
here
he
found
himself
ten
minutes
before
the
time
and
asking
for
a
cup
of
coffee
sat
down
at
a
table
fixed
to
the
ground
in
a
little
separate
box
the
order
was
given
to
a
young
woman
at
a
bar
in
the
room
then
an
ancient
waiter
hobbled
up
to
him
and
explained
that
coffee
was
not
quite
ready
in
truth
coffee
was
not
often
asked
for
at
the
jericho
coffee
house
the
house
said
the
waiter
was
celebrated
for
its
sherry
would
he
take
half
a
pint
of
sherry
so
he
ordered
the
sherry
which
was
afterwards
drunk
by
bollum
bollum
came
punctual
to
the
moment
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
with
alacrity
caldigate
how
is
it
to
be
i
think
you
must
have
seen
that
what
i
have
proposed
will
be
for
the
best
will
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
do
bollum
said
caldigate
very
gravely
can
not
be
said
that
i
owe
crinkett
a
shilling
not
but
it
comes
very
near
owing
does
it
near
that
i
mean
to
pay
it
right
near
that
i
do
like
to
feel
that
i
have
got
his
money
in
my
pocket
as
far
as
money
goes
i
have
been
a
fortunate
man
said
bollum
enthusiastically
as
i
was
once
in
partnership
with
your
uncle
i
do
not
like
to
think
that
i
enriched
myself
by
a
bargain
which
impoverished
him
ai
nice
is
it
that
you
should
have
it
all
and
he
nothing
that
very
strongly
continued
caldigate
merely
shaking
his
head
in
token
of
displeasure
at
bollum
interruption
have
determined
to
repay
crinkett
an
amount
that
seems
to
me
to
be
fair
he
shall
have
back
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
lucky
fellow
and
he
be
off
like
a
shot
like
a
shot
and
others
have
conspired
to
rob
me
of
all
my
happiness
thinking
that
they
might
so
most
probably
get
this
money
from
me
they
have
invented
a
wicked
lie
a
wicked
damnable
lie
a
damnable
lie
they
are
miscreants
foul
miscreants
come
mr
caldigate
miscreants
but
they
shall
have
their
money
and
you
shall
hear
me
tell
them
when
i
give
it
to
them
and
they
must
both
be
here
to
take
it
from
my
hands
that
i
do
not
at
all
require
their
absence
there
is
to
be
no
bargain
between
us
they
are
free
to
remain
and
swear
their
false
oaths
against
me
whether
they
go
or
whether
they
stay
will
be
no
affair
of
mine
go
of
course
mr
caldigate
at
my
instance
i
will
take
care
that
that
shall
be
known
they
must
both
come
and
into
their
joint
hands
will
i
give
the
cheque
and
they
must
come
prepared
with
a
receipt
declaring
that
they
accept
the
money
as
restitution
of
the
loss
incurred
by
them
in
purchasing
the
polyeuka
mine
from
me
do
you
understand
and
i
shall
bring
a
witness
with
me
to
see
them
take
the
money
bollum
who
was
considerably
depressed
by
his
companion
manner
said
that
he
did
understand
suppose
i
can
have
a
private
room
here
at
noon
asked
caldigate
turning
to
the
woman
at
the
bar
when
that
was
settled
he
assured
bollum
that
a
cheque
for
the
amount
should
be
placed
in
the
joint
hands
of
timothy
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
if
he
and
they
with
him
would
be
there
at
noon
on
the
following
day
bollum
in
vain
attempted
to
manage
the
payment
without
the
personal
interview
but
at
last
agreed
that
the
man
and
the
woman
should
be
forthcoming
that
night
caldigate
dined
at
his
club
one
of
the
university
clubs
at
which
he
had
been
elected
just
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
he
had
seldom
been
there
but
now
walked
into
the
resolving
that
he
would
not
be
ashamed
to
show
himself
he
fancied
that
everybody
looked
at
him
and
probably
there
were
some
present
who
knew
that
he
was
about
to
stand
his
trial
for
bigamy
but
he
got
his
dinner
and
smoked
his
cigar
and
before
the
evening
was
over
he
had
met
an
old
college
friend
he
was
in
want
of
a
friend
and
explained
his
wants
he
told
something
of
his
immediate
story
and
then
asked
the
man
to
be
present
at
the
scene
on
the
morrow
must
have
a
witness
gray
said
he
you
will
do
me
a
kindness
if
you
will
come
then
gray
promised
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
on
the
following
morning
he
met
gray
at
the
club
having
the
cheque
ready
in
his
pocket
and
together
they
proceeded
to
levant
court
again
he
was
a
little
before
his
time
and
the
two
sat
together
in
the
gloomy
little
room
bollum
was
the
first
to
come
and
when
he
saw
the
stranger
was
silent
thinking
whether
it
might
not
be
best
to
escape
and
warn
crinkett
and
the
woman
that
all
might
not
be
safe
but
the
stranger
did
not
look
like
a
detective
and
as
he
told
himself
why
should
there
be
danger
so
he
waited
and
in
a
few
minutes
crinkett
entered
the
room
with
the
woman
veiled
caldigate
said
crinkett
is
it
with
you
you
please
smith
said
caldigate
must
ask
you
to
remove
your
veil
so
that
i
may
be
sure
that
it
is
you
she
removed
her
veil
very
slowly
and
then
stood
looking
him
in
the
face
not
full
in
the
face
for
she
could
not
quite
raise
her
eyes
to
meet
his
and
though
she
made
an
effort
to
brazen
it
out
she
could
not
quite
succeed
she
attempted
to
raise
her
head
and
carry
herself
with
pride
but
every
now
and
again
there
was
a
slight
quiver
slight
but
still
visible
the
effort
too
was
visible
but
there
she
stood
looking
at
him
and
to
be
looked
at
but
without
a
word
during
the
whole
interview
she
never
once
opened
her
lips
she
had
lost
all
her
comeliness
it
was
now
nearly
seven
years
since
they
two
had
been
on
the
goldfinder
together
and
then
he
had
found
her
very
attractive
there
was
no
attraction
now
she
was
much
aged
and
her
face
was
coarse
as
though
she
had
taken
to
drinking
but
there
was
still
about
her
something
of
that
look
of
intellect
which
had
captivated
him
more
perhaps
than
her
beauty
since
those
days
she
had
become
a
slave
to
gold
and
such
slavery
is
hardly
compatible
with
good
looks
in
a
woman
there
she
stood
ready
to
listen
to
him
ready
to
take
his
money
but
determined
not
to
utter
a
word
then
he
took
the
cheque
out
of
his
pocket
and
holding
it
in
his
hand
spoke
to
them
as
follows
have
explained
to
bollum
and
have
explained
to
my
friend
here
gray
the
reasons
which
induce
me
to
pay
to
you
timothy
crinkett
and
to
you
euphemia
smith
the
large
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
nature
of
our
transactions
has
been
such
that
i
feel
bound
in
honour
to
repay
so
much
of
the
price
you
paid
for
the
polyeuka
mine
right
caldigate
all
right
said
crinkett
i
have
explained
also
to
both
of
them
that
this
payment
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
base
false
and
most
wicked
charge
which
you
are
bringing
against
me
it
is
not
because
that
woman
by
a
vile
perjury
claims
me
as
her
husband
and
because
i
wish
to
buy
her
silence
or
his
that
i
make
this
restitution
i
restore
the
money
of
my
own
free
will
without
any
base
bargain
you
can
go
on
with
your
perjury
or
abstain
from
it
as
you
may
think
best
understand
squire
said
crinkett
affecting
to
laugh
hand
over
the
money
that
all
then
the
woman
looked
round
at
her
companion
and
a
frown
came
across
her
face
but
she
said
nothing
turning
her
face
again
upon
caldigate
and
endeavouring
to
keep
her
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
upon
him
you
brought
a
receipt
signed
by
both
of
you
then
bollum
handed
him
a
receipt
signed
crinkett
for
self
and
partners
but
caldigate
demanded
that
the
woman
also
should
sign
it
is
a
difficulty
about
the
name
you
see
said
bollum
there
was
a
difficulty
about
the
name
certainly
it
would
not
be
fair
he
thought
that
he
should
force
her
to
the
use
of
a
name
she
disowned
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
hindered
from
what
he
was
doing
by
her
persistency
in
calling
herself
by
his
own
name
be
it
said
he
is
the
cheque
gray
will
see
that
i
put
it
into
both
their
hands
this
he
did
each
of
them
stretching
out
a
hand
to
take
it
now
you
can
go
where
you
please
and
act
as
you
please
you
have
combined
to
rob
me
of
all
that
i
value
most
by
the
basest
of
lies
but
not
on
that
account
have
i
abstained
from
doing
what
i
believe
to
be
an
act
of
justice
then
he
left
the
room
and
paying
for
the
use
of
it
to
the
woman
at
the
bar
walked
off
with
his
friend
gray
leaving
crinkett
bollum
and
the
woman
still
within
the
house
chapter
xl
waiting
for
the
trial
as
he
returned
to
cambridge
caldigate
was
not
altogether
contented
with
himself
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
in
reference
to
the
money
which
he
had
refunded
that
in
what
he
had
done
he
had
not
at
all
been
actuated
by
the
charge
made
against
him
had
there
been
no
such
accusation
he
would
have
felt
himself
bound
to
share
the
loss
with
these
people
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
the
real
circumstances
the
money
had
been
a
burden
to
him
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
own
honour
of
his
own
feelings
it
had
become
necessary
that
the
money
should
be
refunded
and
the
need
of
doing
so
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
a
base
conspiracy
had
been
made
by
a
gang
of
villains
who
had
thought
that
the
money
might
thus
be
most
readily
extracted
from
him
that
was
his
argument
with
himself
and
his
defence
for
what
he
had
done
but
nevertheless
he
was
aware
that
he
had
been
driven
to
do
it
now
to
pay
the
money
at
this
special
moment
by
an
undercurrent
of
hope
that
these
enemies
would
think
it
best
for
themselves
to
go
as
soon
as
they
had
his
money
in
their
hands
he
wished
to
be
honest
he
wished
to
be
honourable
he
wished
that
all
that
he
did
could
be
what
the
world
calls
board
but
still
it
was
so
essential
for
him
and
for
his
wife
that
they
should
go
he
had
been
very
steady
in
assuring
these
wretched
ones
that
they
might
go
or
stay
as
they
pleased
he
had
been
careful
that
there
should
be
a
credible
witness
of
his
assurance
he
might
succeed
in
making
others
believe
that
he
had
not
attempted
to
purchase
their
absence
but
he
could
not
make
himself
believe
it
even
though
a
jury
should
not
convict
him
there
was
so
much
in
his
australian
life
which
would
not
bear
the
searching
light
of
the
same
may
probably
be
said
of
most
of
us
in
such
trials
as
this
that
he
was
anticipating
there
is
often
a
special
cruelty
in
the
exposure
of
matters
which
are
for
the
most
part
happily
kept
in
the
background
a
man
on
some
occasion
inadvertently
takes
a
little
more
wine
than
is
good
for
him
it
is
an
accident
most
uncommon
with
him
and
nobody
thinks
much
about
it
but
chance
brings
the
case
to
the
notice
of
the
police
courts
and
the
poor
victim
is
published
to
the
world
as
a
drunkard
in
the
columns
of
all
the
newspapers
some
young
girl
fancies
herself
in
love
and
the
man
is
unworthy
the
feeling
passes
away
and
none
but
herself
and
perhaps
her
mother
are
the
wiser
but
if
by
some
chance
some
treachery
a
letter
should
get
printed
and
read
the
poor
girl
punishment
is
so
severe
that
she
is
driven
to
wish
herself
in
the
grave
he
had
been
foolish
very
foolish
as
we
have
seen
on
board
the
goldfinder
and
wicked
too
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
when
it
would
all
come
out
in
this
dreaded
trial
he
would
be
quite
unable
to
defend
himself
there
was
enough
to
enable
bolton
to
point
at
him
with
a
finger
of
scorn
as
a
degraded
sinner
and
yet
yet
there
had
been
nothing
which
he
had
not
dared
to
own
to
his
wife
in
the
secrecy
of
their
mutual
confidence
and
which
in
secret
she
had
not
been
able
to
condone
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
had
been
in
love
with
the
woman
in
love
after
a
fashion
he
had
promised
to
marry
her
he
had
done
worse
than
that
and
then
when
he
had
found
that
the
passion
for
gold
was
strong
upon
her
he
had
bought
his
freedom
from
her
the
story
would
be
very
bad
as
told
in
court
and
yet
he
had
told
it
all
to
his
wife
she
had
admitted
his
excuse
when
he
had
spoken
of
the
savageness
of
his
life
of
the
craving
which
a
man
would
feel
for
some
feminine
society
of
her
undoubted
cleverness
and
then
of
her
avarice
and
then
when
he
swore
that
through
it
all
he
had
still
loved
her
her
hester
bolton
whom
he
had
but
once
seen
but
whom
having
seen
he
had
never
allowed
to
pass
out
of
his
mind
she
still
believed
him
and
thought
that
the
holiness
of
that
love
had
purified
him
she
believed
him
but
who
else
would
believe
him
of
course
he
was
most
anxious
that
those
people
should
go
before
he
left
london
he
wrote
both
to
seely
and
to
robert
bolton
saying
what
he
had
done
the
letter
to
his
own
attorney
was
long
and
full
he
gave
an
account
in
detail
of
the
whole
matter
declaring
that
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
hindered
from
paying
a
debt
which
he
believed
to
be
due
by
the
wickedness
of
those
to
whom
it
was
owing
two
things
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
he
said
if
you
choose
to
throw
up
my
defence
of
course
you
can
do
so
i
can
not
allow
myself
to
be
debarred
from
exercising
my
own
judgment
in
another
matter
because
you
think
that
what
i
decide
upon
doing
may
not
tally
with
your
views
as
to
my
defence
to
robert
bolton
he
was
much
shorter
think
you
ought
to
know
what
i
have
done
he
said
any
rate
i
do
not
choose
that
you
should
be
left
in
ignorance
seely
took
no
notice
of
the
communication
not
feeling
himself
bound
to
carry
out
his
threat
by
withdrawing
his
assistance
from
his
client
but
robert
and
william
bolton
agreed
to
have
crinkett
movements
watched
by
a
detective
policeman
they
were
both
determined
that
if
possible
crinkett
and
the
woman
should
be
kept
in
the
country
in
these
days
the
old
squire
made
many
changes
in
his
residence
vacillating
between
his
house
in
cambridge
and
the
house
at
folking
his
books
were
at
cambridge
and
he
could
not
have
them
brought
back
and
yet
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
evince
his
constancy
to
his
son
his
conviction
of
his
son
innocence
by
remaining
at
folking
and
he
was
aware
too
that
his
presence
there
was
a
comfort
both
to
his
son
and
hester
when
john
caldigate
had
gone
up
to
london
his
father
had
been
in
cambridge
but
on
his
return
he
found
the
old
squire
at
his
old
house
he
said
telling
the
story
of
what
he
had
just
done
have
paid
twenty
thousand
pounds
out
of
hand
to
those
rascals
simply
because
i
thought
i
owed
it
to
them
the
squire
shook
his
head
not
being
able
to
approve
of
the
act
i
do
see
why
i
should
have
allowed
myself
to
be
hindered
from
doing
what
i
thought
to
be
right
because
they
were
doing
what
they
knew
to
be
wrong
wo
go
you
know
daresay
not
sir
why
should
they
the
jury
will
believe
that
you
intended
to
purchase
their
absence
think
i
have
made
all
that
clear
am
afraid
not
john
the
man
applied
to
you
for
the
money
and
was
refused
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
then
the
application
was
repeated
by
the
woman
with
a
threat
and
you
again
refused
then
they
present
themselves
to
the
magistrates
and
make
the
accusation
and
upon
that
you
pay
the
money
of
course
it
will
come
out
at
the
trial
that
you
paid
it
immediately
after
this
renewed
application
from
bollum
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
defied
them
did
defy
them
said
john
caldigate
but
all
that
his
father
said
seemed
to
him
to
be
true
so
that
he
repented
himself
of
what
he
had
done
he
made
no
inquiry
on
the
subject
but
early
in
may
he
heard
from
seely
that
crinkett
and
the
woman
were
still
in
london
and
that
they
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
going
at
once
to
australia
according
to
seely
story
of
the
truth
of
which
he
declared
himself
to
be
by
no
means
certain
crinkett
had
wished
to
go
but
had
been
retained
by
the
woman
far
as
i
can
learn
said
seely
is
in
communication
with
the
boltons
who
will
of
course
keep
her
if
it
be
possible
he
would
get
off
if
he
could
but
she
i
take
it
has
got
hold
of
the
money
when
you
made
the
cheque
payable
to
her
order
you
effectually
provided
for
their
remaining
here
if
he
could
have
got
the
money
without
her
name
he
would
have
gone
and
she
would
have
gone
with
him
that
was
not
my
object
said
caldigate
angrily
seely
thereupon
shrugged
his
shoulders
early
in
june
the
man
came
back
who
had
been
sent
out
to
sydney
in
february
on
behalf
of
caldigate
he
also
had
been
commissioned
to
seek
for
evidence
and
to
bring
back
with
him
almost
at
any
cost
whatever
witness
or
witnesses
he
might
find
whose
presence
in
england
would
serve
caldigate
cause
but
he
brought
no
one
and
had
learned
very
little
he
too
had
been
at
ahalala
and
at
nobble
at
nobble
the
people
were
now
very
full
of
the
subject
and
were
very
much
divided
in
opinion
there
were
crinketters
and
caldigatites
and
a
certain
number
of
persons
were
ready
to
swear
that
there
had
been
a
marriage
and
an
equal
number
perhaps
to
swear
that
there
had
been
none
but
no
new
fact
had
been
brought
to
light
dick
shand
had
not
been
found
who
had
been
living
with
caldigate
when
the
marriage
was
supposed
to
have
been
solemnised
nor
had
that
register
been
discovered
from
which
the
copy
of
the
certificate
was
supposed
to
have
been
taken
all
through
the
colony
so
said
this
agent
a
very
great
interest
was
felt
in
the
matter
the
newspapers
from
day
to
day
contained
paragraphs
about
it
but
nobody
had
appeared
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
bring
home
henniker
of
the
hotel
at
nobble
had
offered
to
swear
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
this
offer
she
made
and
repeated
when
she
had
come
to
understand
accurately
on
whose
behalf
this
last
agent
had
come
to
the
colony
but
then
before
she
had
understood
this
she
had
offered
to
swear
the
reverse
and
it
became
known
that
she
was
very
anxious
to
be
carried
back
to
the
old
country
free
of
expense
no
credible
witness
could
be
found
who
had
heard
caldigate
call
the
woman
smith
after
the
date
assigned
to
the
marriage
she
no
doubt
had
used
various
names
had
called
herself
sometimes
caldigate
sometimes
smith
but
generally
in
such
documents
as
she
had
to
sign
in
reference
to
her
mining
shares
euphemia
cettini
it
was
by
that
name
that
she
had
been
known
in
sydney
when
performing
on
the
stage
and
it
was
now
alleged
on
her
behalf
that
she
had
bought
and
sold
shares
in
that
name
under
the
idea
that
she
would
thus
best
secure
to
herself
their
separate
and
undisturbed
possession
proof
was
brought
home
that
caldigate
himself
had
made
over
to
her
shares
in
that
name
but
seely
did
not
depend
much
on
this
as
proof
against
the
marriage
seely
seemed
to
depend
very
little
on
anything
so
little
that
caldigate
almost
wished
that
he
had
carried
out
his
threat
and
thrown
up
the
case
he
not
believe
you
when
you
tell
him
his
wife
asked
caldigate
was
forced
to
confess
that
apparently
the
lawyer
did
not
believe
him
in
fact
seely
had
even
said
as
much
such
cases
a
lawyer
should
never
believe
or
disbelieve
or
if
he
does
he
should
never
speak
of
his
belief
it
is
with
your
acquittal
or
conviction
that
i
am
concerned
in
which
matter
i
can
better
assist
you
by
cool
judgment
than
by
any
fervid
assurance
all
this
made
caldigate
not
only
angry
but
unhappy
for
he
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
the
public
around
him
were
in
the
same
mind
as
seely
in
his
own
parish
they
believed
him
but
apparently
not
beyond
his
parish
it
might
be
possible
that
he
should
escape
that
seemed
to
be
the
general
opinion
but
then
general
opinion
went
on
to
declare
that
there
was
no
reason
for
supposing
that
he
had
not
married
the
woman
merely
because
he
said
that
he
had
not
done
so
then
gradually
there
fell
upon
poor
hester
mind
a
doubt
and
after
that
almost
a
conviction
not
a
doubt
as
to
her
husband
truth
no
suspicion
on
that
score
ever
troubled
her
for
a
moment
but
there
came
upon
her
a
fear
almost
more
than
a
fear
that
these
terrible
enemies
would
be
strong
enough
to
override
the
truth
and
to
carry
with
them
both
a
judge
and
a
jury
as
the
summer
months
ran
on
they
all
became
aware
that
for
any
purpose
of
removing
the
witnesses
the
money
had
been
paid
in
vain
crinkett
was
living
in
all
opulence
at
a
hotel
at
brighton
and
the
woman
calling
herself
caldigate
had
taken
furnished
apartments
in
london
rumour
came
that
she
was
frequently
seen
at
the
theatres
and
that
she
had
appeared
more
than
once
in
an
open
carriage
in
the
parks
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
caldigate
money
had
made
them
very
comfortable
for
the
present
the
whole
story
of
the
money
had
been
made
public
and
of
course
there
were
various
opinions
about
it
the
prevailing
idea
was
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
buy
off
the
first
wife
but
that
the
first
wife
had
been
clever
enough
to
get
the
money
without
having
to
go
caldigate
was
thought
to
have
been
very
foolish
on
which
subject
bollum
once
expressed
himself
strongly
to
a
friend
he
said
clever
the
greatest
idiot
i
ever
came
across
in
my
life
i
made
it
quite
straight
for
him
so
that
there
could
have
been
a
wrinkle
but
he
would
have
it
there
are
men
so
soft
that
one
ca
understand
to
do
bollum
justice
it
should
be
said
that
he
was
most
anxious
to
induce
his
uncle
and
the
woman
to
leave
the
country
when
they
had
got
the
money
though
very
miserable
hester
was
very
brave
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
she
would
never
allow
herself
to
seem
to
doubt
she
would
speak
of
their
marriage
as
a
thing
so
holy
that
nothing
within
the
power
of
man
could
disturb
it
of
course
they
were
man
and
wife
and
of
course
the
truth
would
at
last
prevail
was
not
the
lord
able
in
his
own
good
time
to
set
all
these
matters
right
and
in
discussing
the
matter
with
him
she
would
always
seem
to
imply
that
the
lord
good
time
would
be
the
time
of
the
trial
she
would
never
herself
hint
to
him
that
there
might
be
a
period
of
separation
coming
though
in
secrecy
she
was
preparing
for
what
might
befall
him
turning
over
in
her
woman
mind
how
she
might
best
relieve
the
agony
of
his
jail
she
let
no
sign
escape
her
that
she
looked
forward
to
such
misery
she
let
no
such
sign
escape
her
in
her
intercourse
with
him
but
with
his
father
she
could
speak
more
freely
it
had
indeed
come
to
be
understood
between
her
and
the
old
squire
that
it
would
be
best
that
they
should
discuss
the
matter
openly
arrangements
must
be
made
for
their
future
life
so
that
when
the
blow
came
they
might
not
be
unprepared
hester
declared
that
nothing
but
positive
want
of
shelter
should
induce
her
to
go
back
to
chesterton
think
him
to
be
all
that
bad
she
said
know
him
to
be
all
that
good
how
is
it
possible
that
we
should
live
together
the
old
man
had
of
course
turned
it
over
much
in
his
mind
if
it
could
be
true
that
that
woman
had
in
truth
become
his
son
wife
and
that
this
dear
sweet
young
mother
had
been
deceived
betrayed
and
cheated
out
of
her
very
existence
then
that
house
at
folking
could
be
no
proper
home
for
her
her
grave
would
be
best
but
till
that
might
be
reached
any
home
would
be
better
than
folking
but
he
was
almost
sure
that
it
was
not
so
and
her
confidence
old
as
he
was
and
prone
to
be
suspicious
made
him
confident
when
the
moment
came
he
could
not
doubt
how
he
would
answer
her
he
could
not
crush
her
spirit
by
seeming
for
a
moment
to
have
a
suspicion
home
of
course
shall
be
here
he
said
shall
be
your
own
house
you
shall
be
my
house
too
if
it
should
come
to
that
we
will
be
at
any
rate
together
you
shall
not
be
left
without
a
friend
is
not
for
myself
she
said
for
his
boy
and
for
him
what
will
be
best
for
them
i
would
take
a
cabin
at
the
so
as
to
be
nearest
to
him
if
it
were
only
myself
and
so
it
was
settled
between
them
that
should
that
great
misery
fall
upon
them
she
would
remain
at
folking
and
he
would
remain
with
her
nothing
that
judge
or
jury
could
do
would
deprive
her
of
the
right
to
occupy
her
house
in
this
way
the
months
of
may
and
june
and
the
first
fortnight
of
july
wore
themselves
away
and
then
the
time
for
the
trial
had
come
up
to
the
last
it
had
been
hoped
that
tidings
might
be
heard
either
by
letter
or
telegram
from
dick
shand
but
it
seemed
that
he
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
no
suggestion
of
news
as
to
his
whereabouts
was
received
on
which
it
might
have
been
possible
to
found
an
argument
for
the
further
postponement
of
the
trial
seely
had
been
anxious
for
such
postponement
perhaps
thinking
that
as
the
hotel
at
brighton
and
the
carriages
in
the
park
were
expensive
crinkett
and
the
lady
might
take
their
departure
for
australia
without
saying
a
word
to
the
lawyer
who
had
undertaken
the
prosecution
but
there
was
no
adequate
ground
for
delay
and
on
tuesday
the
july
the
trial
was
to
be
commenced
on
the
previous
day
caldigate
at
his
own
request
was
introduced
to
sir
john
joram
who
had
been
brought
down
special
to
cambridge
for
his
defence
seely
had
advised
him
not
to
see
the
barrister
who
was
to
defend
him
leaving
it
however
quite
at
his
option
to
do
so
or
not
as
he
pleased
john
will
see
you
but
i
think
he
had
rather
not
said
seely
but
caldigate
had
chosen
to
have
the
interview
have
thought
it
best
to
say
just
one
word
to
you
said
caldigate
am
quite
at
your
service
said
sir
john
want
you
to
hear
from
my
own
lips
that
a
falser
charge
than
this
was
never
made
against
a
man
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
sir
john
and
then
he
paused
is
to
say
caldigate
i
am
bound
in
courtesy
to
you
to
make
some
such
civil
reply
as
i
should
have
made
had
i
not
been
employed
in
your
case
and
had
circumstances
then
induced
you
to
make
such
a
statement
to
me
but
in
truth
as
i
am
so
employed
no
statement
from
your
lips
ought
to
affect
me
in
the
least
for
your
own
sake
i
will
say
that
no
statement
will
affect
me
it
is
not
for
me
to
believe
or
disbelieve
anything
in
this
matter
if
carried
away
by
my
feelings
i
were
to
appeal
to
the
jury
for
their
sympathy
because
of
my
belief
i
should
betray
your
cause
it
will
be
my
duty
not
to
make
the
jury
believe
you
who
in
your
position
will
not
be
expected
even
to
tell
the
truth
but
to
induce
them
if
possible
to
disbelieve
the
witnesses
against
you
who
will
be
on
their
oath
protestations
from
an
advocate
are
never
of
much
avail
and
in
many
cases
have
been
prejudicial
i
can
only
assure
you
that
i
understand
the
importance
of
the
interests
confided
to
me
and
that
i
will
endeavour
to
be
true
to
my
trust
caldigate
who
wanted
sympathy
who
wanted
an
assurance
of
confidence
in
his
word
was
by
no
means
contented
with
his
counsellor
but
he
was
too
wise
at
the
present
moment
to
quarrel
with
him
chapter
xli
the
first
day
then
came
the
morning
on
which
caldigate
and
hester
must
part
very
little
had
been
said
about
it
but
a
word
or
two
had
been
absolutely
necessary
the
trial
would
probably
take
two
days
and
it
would
not
be
well
that
he
should
be
brought
back
to
folking
for
the
sad
intervening
night
and
then
should
the
verdict
be
given
against
him
the
prison
doors
would
be
closed
against
her
his
wife
more
rigidly
than
against
any
other
friend
who
might
knock
at
them
inquiring
after
his
welfare
her
at
any
rate
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
see
all
the
prison
authorities
would
be
bound
to
regard
her
as
the
victim
of
his
crime
and
as
the
instrument
of
his
vice
the
law
would
have
locked
him
up
to
avenge
her
injuries
of
her
whose
only
future
joy
could
come
from
that
distant
freedom
which
the
fraudulent
law
would
at
length
allow
to
him
all
this
was
not
put
into
words
between
them
but
it
was
understood
it
might
be
that
they
were
to
be
parted
now
for
a
term
of
years
during
which
she
would
be
as
a
widow
at
folking
while
he
would
be
alone
in
his
jail
there
are
moments
as
to
which
it
would
be
so
much
better
that
their
coming
should
never
be
accomplished
it
would
have
been
better
for
them
both
had
they
been
separated
without
that
last
embrace
he
was
to
start
from
folking
at
eight
that
he
might
surrender
himself
to
the
hands
of
justice
in
due
time
for
the
trial
at
ten
she
did
not
come
down
with
him
to
the
breakfast
parlour
having
been
requested
by
him
not
to
be
there
among
the
servants
when
he
took
his
departure
but
standing
there
in
her
own
room
with
his
baby
in
her
arms
she
spoke
her
last
word
will
keep
up
your
courage
john
will
try
hester
will
keep
up
mine
i
will
never
fail
for
your
sake
and
his
here
she
held
the
child
a
moment
away
from
her
bosom
will
never
allow
myself
to
droop
to
be
your
wife
and
his
mother
shall
be
enough
to
support
me
even
though
you
should
be
torn
from
both
of
us
for
a
time
wish
i
were
as
brave
as
you
he
said
will
leave
me
here
she
continued
of
your
house
and
if
god
spares
me
here
you
will
find
me
they
ca
move
me
from
this
your
father
says
so
they
may
call
me
what
they
will
but
they
can
not
move
me
there
is
the
lord
above
us
and
before
him
they
can
not
make
me
other
than
your
wife
your
wife
your
wife
as
she
repeated
the
name
she
put
the
boy
out
to
him
and
when
he
had
taken
the
child
she
stretched
out
her
hands
upwards
and
falling
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
prayed
to
god
for
his
deliverance
him
come
back
to
us
o
my
god
deliver
him
from
his
enemies
and
let
him
come
back
to
us
kiss
my
own
he
said
as
he
raised
her
from
the
ground
yes
and
a
thousand
shall
be
in
store
for
you
when
you
come
back
to
us
yes
kiss
him
too
your
boy
shall
hear
the
praises
of
his
father
every
day
till
at
last
he
shall
understand
that
he
may
be
proud
of
you
even
though
he
should
have
learned
why
it
is
that
you
are
not
with
him
now
go
my
darling
go
and
support
yourself
by
remembering
that
i
have
got
that
within
me
which
will
support
me
then
he
left
her
the
old
squire
had
expressed
his
intention
of
being
present
throughout
the
trial
and
now
was
ready
for
the
journey
when
counselled
to
remain
at
home
both
by
seely
and
by
his
son
he
had
declared
that
only
by
his
presence
could
he
make
the
world
around
him
understand
how
confident
he
was
of
his
son
innocence
so
it
was
arranged
and
a
place
was
kept
for
him
next
to
the
attorney
the
servants
all
came
out
into
the
hall
and
shook
hands
with
their
young
master
and
the
cook
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
declared
that
she
would
have
dinner
ready
for
him
on
the
following
day
at
the
front
door
holt
was
standing
having
come
over
the
ferry
to
greet
the
young
squire
before
his
departure
may
say
what
they
will
there
squire
but
they
wo
make
none
of
us
here
believe
that
you
been
the
man
to
injure
a
lady
such
as
she
up
there
then
there
was
another
shaking
of
hands
and
the
father
and
son
got
into
the
carriage
the
court
was
full
of
course
justice
bramber
by
whom
the
case
was
to
be
tried
was
reputed
to
be
an
excellent
judge
a
man
of
no
softnesses
able
to
wear
the
black
cap
without
convulsive
throbbings
anxious
also
that
the
law
should
run
its
course
averse
to
mercy
when
guilt
had
been
proved
but
as
and
as
just
as
minos
a
man
whom
nothing
could
turn
one
way
or
another
who
could
hang
his
friend
but
who
would
certainly
not
mulct
his
enemy
because
he
was
his
enemy
it
had
reached
caldigate
ears
that
he
was
unfortunate
in
his
judge
by
which
they
who
had
so
said
had
intended
to
imply
that
this
mind
would
not
be
perverted
by
any
sentiments
as
to
the
prisoner
as
to
the
sweet
young
woman
who
called
herself
his
wife
at
home
or
as
to
want
of
sweetness
on
the
part
of
the
other
woman
who
claimed
him
the
jury
was
sworn
in
without
more
than
ordinary
delay
and
then
the
trial
was
commenced
that
which
had
to
be
done
for
the
prosecution
seemed
to
be
simple
enough
the
first
witness
called
was
the
woman
herself
who
was
summoned
in
the
names
of
euphemia
caldigate
smith
she
gave
her
evidence
very
clearly
and
with
great
composure
saying
how
she
had
become
acquainted
with
the
man
on
board
the
ship
how
she
had
been
engaged
to
him
at
melbourne
how
he
had
come
down
to
her
at
sydney
how
in
compliance
with
his
orders
she
had
followed
him
up
to
ahalala
and
how
she
had
there
been
married
to
him
by
allan
then
she
brought
forth
the
documents
which
professed
to
be
the
copy
of
the
register
of
the
marriage
made
by
the
minister
in
his
own
book
and
the
envelope
the
damning
envelope
which
caldigate
was
prepared
to
admit
that
he
had
himself
addressed
to
caldigate
and
the
letter
which
purported
to
have
been
written
by
the
minister
to
caldigate
recommending
him
to
be
married
in
some
better
established
township
than
that
existing
at
ahalala
she
did
it
well
she
was
very
correct
and
at
the
same
time
very
determined
giving
many
details
of
her
early
theatrical
life
which
it
was
thought
better
to
get
from
her
in
the
comparative
ease
of
a
direct
examination
than
to
have
them
extracted
afterwards
by
an
adverse
advocate
during
her
evidence
in
chief
which
was
necessarily
long
she
seemed
to
be
quite
at
ease
but
those
around
her
observed
that
she
never
once
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
whom
she
claimed
as
her
husband
except
when
she
was
asked
whether
the
man
there
before
her
was
the
man
she
had
married
at
ahalala
then
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
she
replied
very
steadily
that
is
my
husband
john
caldigate
to
caldigate
and
his
friends
and
indeed
to
all
those
collected
in
the
court
the
most
interesting
person
of
the
day
was
sir
john
joram
in
a
sensational
cause
the
leading
barrister
for
the
defence
is
always
the
hero
of
the
plot
the
actor
from
whom
the
best
bit
of
acting
is
expected
the
person
who
is
most
likely
to
become
a
personage
on
the
occasion
the
prisoners
are
necessarily
mute
and
can
only
be
looked
at
not
heard
the
judge
is
not
expected
to
do
much
till
the
time
comes
for
his
charge
and
even
then
is
supposed
to
lower
the
dignity
of
the
bench
if
he
makes
his
charge
with
any
view
to
effect
on
his
own
behalf
the
barrister
who
prosecutes
should
be
tame
or
he
will
appear
to
be
vindictive
the
witnesses
however
interesting
they
may
be
in
detail
are
but
episodes
each
comes
and
goes
and
there
is
an
end
of
them
but
the
part
of
the
defending
advocate
requires
action
through
the
whole
of
the
piece
and
he
may
be
impassioned
he
is
bound
to
be
on
the
alert
everything
seems
to
depend
on
him
they
who
accuse
can
have
or
should
have
no
longing
for
the
condemnation
of
the
accused
one
but
in
regard
to
the
other
an
acquittal
is
a
matter
of
personal
prowess
of
professional
triumph
and
possibly
of
well
simulated
feeling
sir
john
joram
was
at
this
time
a
man
of
considerable
dignity
above
fifty
years
of
age
having
already
served
the
offices
of
solicitor
and
to
his
party
to
his
compeers
and
intimate
friends
it
seemed
to
be
but
the
other
day
since
he
was
jacky
joram
one
of
the
jolliest
little
fellows
ever
known
at
an
evening
party
up
to
every
kind
of
fun
always
rather
short
of
money
and
one
of
whom
it
was
thought
that
because
he
was
he
might
some
day
achieve
the
success
of
marrying
a
woman
with
money
on
a
sudden
he
married
a
girl
without
a
shilling
and
men
shook
their
heads
and
sighed
as
they
spoke
of
poor
jacky
joram
but
again
on
a
sudden
quite
as
suddenly
there
came
tidings
that
jacky
had
been
found
out
by
the
attorneys
and
that
he
was
earning
his
bread
as
we
grow
old
things
seem
to
come
so
quickly
his
friends
had
hardly
realised
the
fact
that
jacky
was
earning
his
bread
before
he
was
in
parliament
and
had
ceased
to
be
jacky
and
the
celerity
with
which
he
became
sir
john
was
the
most
astonishing
of
all
years
no
doubt
had
passed
by
but
years
at
fifty
are
no
more
than
months
at
thirty
are
less
than
weeks
in
boyhood
and
now
while
some
tongues
by
dint
of
sheer
habit
were
still
forming
themselves
into
jacky
sir
john
joram
had
become
the
leading
advocate
of
the
day
and
a
man
renowned
for
the
dignity
of
his
manners
in
the
house
for
he
had
quite
got
the
ear
of
the
house
a
certain
impressive
good
sense
a
habit
of
saying
nothing
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
occasion
had
chiefly
made
for
him
the
high
character
he
enjoyed
but
in
the
law
courts
it
was
perhaps
his
complaisance
his
peculiar
courtesy
of
which
they
who
praised
him
talked
the
most
his
aptitude
to
get
verdicts
was
of
course
the
cause
of
his
success
but
it
was
observed
of
him
that
in
perverting
the
course
of
justice
which
may
be
said
to
be
the
special
work
of
a
successful
advocate
he
never
condescended
to
bully
anybody
to
his
own
witnesses
he
was
simple
and
courteous
as
are
barristers
generally
but
to
adverse
witnesses
he
was
more
courteous
though
no
doubt
less
simple
even
to
some
perjured
comrade
of
an
habitual
burglar
he
would
be
studiously
civil
but
to
a
woman
such
as
euphemia
caldigate
smith
it
was
certain
that
he
would
be
so
smooth
as
to
make
her
feel
almost
pleased
with
the
amenities
of
her
position
he
asked
her
very
many
questions
offering
to
provide
her
with
the
comfort
of
a
seat
if
it
were
necessary
she
said
that
she
was
not
at
all
tired
and
that
she
preferred
to
stand
as
to
the
absolute
fact
of
the
marriage
she
did
not
hesitate
at
all
she
was
married
in
the
tent
at
ahalala
in
the
presence
of
crinkett
and
adamson
and
of
her
own
female
companion
anna
young
all
of
whom
were
there
to
give
evidence
of
the
fact
whether
any
one
else
was
in
the
tent
she
could
not
say
but
she
knew
that
there
were
others
at
the
entrance
the
tent
was
hardly
large
enough
for
more
than
five
or
six
dick
shand
had
not
been
there
because
he
had
always
been
her
enemy
and
had
tried
to
prevent
the
marriage
and
she
was
quite
clear
about
the
letter
there
was
a
great
deal
said
about
the
letter
she
was
sure
that
the
envelope
with
the
letter
had
come
to
her
at
ahalala
by
post
from
sydney
when
her
husband
was
at
the
latter
place
the
sydney
postmark
with
the
date
was
very
plain
there
was
much
said
as
to
the
accuracy
and
clearness
of
the
sydney
postmark
and
something
as
to
the
absence
of
any
postmark
at
nobble
she
could
not
account
for
the
absence
of
the
nobble
postmark
she
was
aware
that
letters
were
stamped
at
nobble
generally
allan
she
said
had
himself
handed
to
her
the
copy
of
the
register
almost
immediately
after
the
marriage
but
she
could
not
say
by
whom
it
had
been
copied
the
letter
purporting
to
be
from
allan
to
her
husband
was
no
doubt
she
said
in
the
minister
handwriting
caldigate
had
showed
it
to
her
before
their
marriage
and
she
had
kept
it
without
any
opposition
from
him
then
she
was
asked
as
to
her
residence
after
her
marriage
and
here
she
was
less
clear
she
had
lived
with
him
first
at
ahalala
and
then
at
nobble
but
she
could
not
say
for
how
long
it
had
been
off
and
on
there
had
been
quarrels
and
after
a
time
they
had
agreed
to
part
she
had
received
from
him
a
certain
amount
of
mining
shares
and
of
money
and
had
undertaken
in
return
never
to
bother
him
any
more
there
was
a
great
deal
said
about
times
and
dates
which
left
an
impression
upon
those
around
her
in
the
court
that
she
was
less
sure
of
her
facts
than
a
woman
in
such
circumstances
naturally
would
have
been
then
sir
john
produced
the
letter
which
she
had
written
to
caldigate
and
in
which
she
had
distinctly
offered
to
marry
crinkett
if
the
money
demanded
were
paid
she
must
have
expected
the
production
of
this
letter
but
still
for
a
few
moments
it
silenced
her
she
said
at
last
wrote
it
the
money
you
demanded
has
been
paid
it
has
been
paid
but
not
then
it
was
not
paid
till
we
came
over
if
it
had
been
paid
then
you
would
have
married
mr
crinkett
sir
john
manner
as
he
asked
the
question
was
so
gentle
and
so
soft
that
it
was
felt
by
all
to
contain
an
apology
for
intruding
on
so
delicate
a
subject
but
when
she
hesitated
he
did
after
a
pause
renew
his
inquiry
in
another
form
this
was
only
a
threat
and
you
had
no
purpose
of
carrying
it
out
then
she
plucked
up
her
courage
have
not
married
him
she
said
did
you
intend
it
did
what
were
the
laws
to
me
out
there
he
had
left
me
and
had
taken
another
wife
i
had
to
do
the
best
for
myself
i
did
intend
it
but
i
did
do
it
a
woman
ca
be
tried
for
her
intentions
said
sir
john
she
may
be
judged
by
her
intentions
then
she
was
asked
why
she
had
not
gone
when
she
had
got
the
money
according
to
her
promise
defied
us
she
said
called
us
bad
names
liars
and
perjurers
he
knew
that
we
were
not
liars
and
then
we
were
watched
and
told
that
we
might
not
go
as
he
said
that
he
was
indifferent
i
was
willing
enough
to
stay
and
see
it
out
can
not
give
us
he
asked
again
and
this
was
his
last
question
clearer
record
of
those
months
which
you
lived
with
your
husband
she
said
can
not
i
kept
no
journal
then
she
was
allowed
to
go
and
though
she
had
been
under
examination
for
three
hours
it
was
thought
she
had
escaped
easily
crinkett
was
the
next
who
swore
that
he
had
been
caldigate
partner
in
sundry
mining
speculations
that
they
had
been
in
every
way
intimate
that
he
had
always
recommended
caldigate
to
marry
smith
thinking
as
he
said
respectability
paid
in
the
long
run
and
that
having
so
advised
him
he
had
become
special
friend
at
the
time
to
the
exclusion
of
dick
shand
who
was
generally
drunk
and
who
whether
drunk
or
sober
was
opposed
to
the
marriage
he
had
been
selected
to
stand
by
his
friend
at
the
marriage
and
he
thinking
that
another
witness
would
be
beneficial
had
taken
adamson
with
him
his
only
wonder
was
that
any
one
should
dispute
a
fact
which
was
at
the
time
so
notorious
both
at
ahalala
and
at
nobble
he
held
his
head
high
during
his
evidence
in
chief
and
more
than
once
called
the
prisoner
knew
this
and
did
that
it
was
past
four
when
he
was
handed
over
for
but
when
it
was
said
that
another
hour
would
suffice
for
it
the
judge
agreed
to
sit
for
that
other
hour
but
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
the
gentleman
who
was
with
sir
john
had
finished
his
work
during
which
crinkett
seemed
to
suffer
much
the
gentleman
was
by
no
means
so
complacent
as
sir
john
and
asked
some
very
disagreeable
questions
had
crinkett
intended
to
commit
bigamy
by
marrying
the
last
witness
knowing
at
the
time
that
she
was
a
married
woman
never
said
that
i
intended
to
marry
her
said
crinkett
she
wrote
to
caldigate
was
nothing
to
me
he
could
not
be
made
to
own
as
she
had
done
in
a
straightforward
way
that
he
had
intended
to
set
the
law
at
defiance
his
courage
failed
him
and
his
presence
of
mind
and
he
was
made
to
declare
at
last
that
he
had
only
talked
about
such
a
marriage
with
the
view
of
keeping
the
woman
in
good
humour
but
that
he
had
never
intended
to
marry
her
then
he
was
asked
as
to
bollum
had
he
told
bollum
that
he
intended
to
marry
the
woman
at
last
he
owned
that
he
might
have
done
so
of
course
he
had
been
anxious
to
get
his
money
and
he
had
thought
that
he
might
best
do
so
by
such
an
offer
he
was
reduced
to
much
misery
during
his
but
on
the
one
main
statement
that
he
had
been
present
at
the
marriage
he
was
not
shaken
at
six
the
trial
was
adjourned
till
the
next
day
and
the
two
caldigates
were
taken
in
a
fly
to
a
neighbouring
inn
at
which
rooms
had
been
provided
for
them
here
they
were
soon
joined
by
seely
who
explained
however
that
he
had
come
merely
to
make
arrangements
for
the
morrow
is
it
going
asked
caldigate
the
question
was
very
natural
but
it
was
one
which
seely
was
not
disposed
to
answer
could
give
an
opinion
he
said
such
cases
i
never
do
give
an
opinion
the
evidence
is
very
clear
and
has
not
been
shaken
but
the
witnesses
are
people
of
a
bad
character
character
goes
a
long
way
with
a
jury
it
will
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
judge
i
should
say
but
i
can
not
give
an
opinion
no
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
was
expressed
to
the
father
or
son
who
indeed
saw
no
one
else
the
whole
evening
but
robert
bolton
in
discussing
the
matter
with
his
father
expressed
a
strong
conviction
that
caldigate
would
be
acquitted
he
had
heard
it
all
and
understood
the
nature
of
such
cases
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
that
they
were
married
said
robert
bolton
the
circumstances
make
me
sure
of
it
but
the
witnesses
are
just
of
that
kind
which
a
jury
always
distrusts
the
jury
will
acquit
him
not
because
they
do
not
believe
the
marriage
but
out
of
enmity
to
crinkett
and
the
woman
shall
we
do
then
asked
the
old
man
to
this
robert
bolton
could
make
no
answer
he
only
shook
his
head
and
turned
away
chapter
xlii
the
second
day
the
court
had
been
very
full
on
the
first
day
of
the
trial
but
on
the
following
morning
it
was
even
more
crowded
so
that
outsiders
who
had
no
friend
connected
with
justice
had
hardly
a
chance
of
hearing
or
seeing
anything
many
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
had
long
been
known
to
the
public
but
matters
of
new
and
of
peculiar
interest
had
been
elicited
the
distinct
promise
made
by
the
woman
to
marry
another
man
so
as
to
render
her
existing
husband
safe
in
his
bigamy
by
committing
bigamy
herself
the
payment
to
these
people
by
caldigate
of
an
immense
sum
of
money
the
fact
that
they
two
had
lived
together
in
australia
whether
married
or
not
all
this
which
had
now
been
acknowledged
on
both
sides
added
to
the
romance
of
the
occasion
while
it
could
hardly
be
doubted
on
the
one
side
that
caldigate
had
married
the
woman
so
strong
was
the
evidence
it
could
not
be
at
all
doubted
on
the
other
side
that
the
accusation
had
been
planned
with
the
view
of
raising
money
and
had
been
the
result
of
a
base
conspiracy
and
then
there
was
the
additional
marvel
that
though
the
money
had
been
paid
the
whole
sum
demanded
yet
the
trial
was
carried
on
the
general
feeling
was
exactly
that
which
robert
bolton
had
attributed
to
the
jury
people
did
believe
that
there
had
been
a
marriage
but
trusted
nevertheless
that
caldigate
might
be
acquitted
so
that
his
recent
marriage
might
be
established
no
doubt
there
was
a
feeling
with
many
that
anything
done
in
the
wilds
of
australia
ought
not
count
here
at
home
in
england
caldigate
with
his
father
was
in
court
a
little
before
ten
and
at
that
hour
punctually
the
trial
was
recommenced
the
first
business
was
the
examination
of
adamson
who
was
quite
clear
as
to
the
marriage
he
had
been
concerned
with
crinkett
in
money
operations
for
many
years
and
had
been
asked
by
him
to
be
present
simply
as
a
witness
he
had
never
been
particularly
intimate
with
caldigate
and
had
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
him
afterwards
he
was
by
the
second
gentleman
but
was
not
subjected
to
much
annoyance
he
had
put
what
little
money
he
possessed
into
the
polyeuka
mine
and
had
come
over
to
england
because
he
had
thought
that
by
so
doing
he
might
perhaps
get
a
portion
of
his
money
back
had
there
been
a
conspiracy
and
was
he
one
of
the
conspirators
well
he
rather
thought
that
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
and
that
he
was
one
of
the
conspirators
but
then
he
had
only
conspired
to
get
what
he
thought
to
be
his
own
he
had
lost
everything
in
the
polyeuka
mine
and
as
the
gentleman
no
doubt
had
married
the
lady
he
thought
he
might
as
well
come
forward
and
that
perhaps
in
that
way
he
would
get
his
money
he
did
not
mind
saying
that
he
had
received
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
which
was
half
what
he
had
put
into
polyeuka
he
hoped
that
after
paying
all
his
expenses
he
would
be
able
to
start
again
at
the
diggings
with
something
above
a
thousand
this
was
all
straight
sailing
the
purpose
which
he
had
in
view
was
so
manifest
that
it
had
hardly
been
worth
while
to
ask
him
the
questions
anna
young
was
the
next
and
she
encountered
the
sweet
courtesies
of
sir
john
joram
these
sweet
courtesies
were
prolonged
for
above
an
hour
and
were
not
apparently
very
sweet
to
miss
young
of
the
witnesses
hitherto
examined
she
was
the
worst
she
had
been
flippantly
confident
in
her
memories
of
the
marriage
ceremony
when
questioned
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution
but
had
forgotten
everything
in
reference
to
her
friend
subsequent
married
life
she
had
forgotten
even
her
own
life
and
did
not
quite
know
where
she
had
lived
and
at
last
she
positively
refused
to
answer
questions
though
they
were
asked
with
the
most
engaging
civility
she
said
that
course
a
lady
had
affairs
which
she
could
not
tell
to
everybody
she
did
mean
lovers
she
did
care
for
the
men
at
all
she
did
mean
money
she
had
done
a
little
mining
and
hoped
to
do
a
little
more
was
to
have
a
thousand
pounds
and
her
expenses
but
she
had
got
the
money
yet
and
so
on
probably
of
all
the
witnesses
yet
examined
miss
young
had
amused
the
court
the
most
there
were
many
others
no
doubt
necessary
for
the
case
but
hardly
necessary
for
the
telling
of
the
story
captain
munday
was
there
the
captain
of
the
goldfinder
who
spoke
of
caldigate
conduct
on
board
and
of
his
own
belief
that
they
two
were
engaged
when
they
left
the
ship
we
are
prepared
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
an
engagement
i
do
not
think
that
we
need
trouble
you
captain
munday
said
sir
john
only
deny
the
marriage
then
the
cheque
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
produced
and
clerks
from
the
bank
to
prove
the
payment
and
the
old
waiter
from
the
jericho
and
others
of
whom
sir
john
joram
refused
to
take
any
notice
whatever
all
that
had
been
acknowledged
of
course
the
money
had
been
paid
of
course
the
intimacy
had
existed
no
doubt
there
had
been
those
interviews
both
at
folking
and
up
in
london
but
had
there
ever
been
a
marriage
in
that
tent
at
ahalala
that
and
that
only
was
the
point
to
which
sir
john
joram
found
it
necessary
to
give
attention
a
slight
interval
was
allowed
for
lunch
and
then
sir
john
rose
to
begin
his
speech
it
was
felt
on
all
sides
that
his
speech
was
to
be
the
great
affair
of
the
trial
would
he
be
able
so
to
represent
these
witnesses
as
to
make
a
jury
believe
that
they
had
sworn
falsely
and
that
the
undoubted
and
acknowledged
conspiracy
to
raise
money
had
been
concocted
without
any
basis
of
truth
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
the
father
remained
with
his
son
in
the
precincts
of
the
prison
and
then
the
judge
and
the
lawyers
and
all
they
whose
places
were
assured
to
them
trooped
back
into
court
they
who
were
less
privileged
had
fed
themselves
with
pocketed
sandwiches
not
caring
to
risk
the
loss
of
their
seats
sir
john
joram
began
by
holding
extended
in
his
fingers
towards
the
jury
the
envelope
which
had
undoubtedly
been
addressed
by
caldigate
to
caldigate
ahalala
nobble
and
in
which
a
certain
letter
had
been
stated
to
have
been
sent
by
him
to
her
words
written
on
that
envelope
said
he
to
my
mind
the
strongest
evidence
i
have
ever
met
of
the
folly
to
which
a
man
may
be
reduced
by
the
softness
of
feminine
intercourse
i
acknowledge
on
the
part
of
my
client
that
he
wrote
these
words
i
acknowledge
that
if
a
man
could
make
a
woman
his
wife
by
so
describing
her
on
a
morsel
of
paper
this
man
would
have
made
this
woman
his
wife
i
acknowledge
so
much
though
i
do
not
acknowledge
though
i
deny
that
any
letter
was
ever
sent
to
this
woman
in
the
envelope
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
his
own
story
is
that
he
wrote
those
words
at
a
moment
of
soft
and
foolish
confidence
when
they
two
together
were
talking
of
a
future
marriage
a
marriage
which
no
doubt
was
contemplated
and
which
probably
had
been
promised
then
he
wrote
the
address
showing
the
woman
the
name
which
would
be
hers
should
they
ever
be
married
and
she
has
craftily
kept
the
document
that
is
his
story
that
is
my
story
now
i
must
show
you
why
i
think
it
also
should
be
your
story
the
woman
i
must
describe
her
in
this
way
lest
i
should
do
her
an
injustice
by
calling
her
smith
or
do
my
client
an
injustice
by
calling
her
caldigate
has
told
you
that
this
envelope
with
an
enclosure
which
she
produced
reached
her
at
nobble
through
the
post
from
sydney
to
that
statement
i
call
upon
you
to
give
no
credit
a
letter
so
sent
would
as
you
have
been
informed
bear
two
postmarks
those
of
sydney
and
of
nobble
this
envelope
bears
one
only
but
that
is
not
all
i
shall
call
before
you
two
gentlemen
experienced
in
affairs
of
the
and
they
will
tell
you
that
the
postmarks
on
this
envelope
both
that
of
the
town
sydney
and
that
by
which
the
postage
stamp
is
obliterated
are
cleaner
finer
and
better
perceived
than
they
would
have
been
had
it
passed
in
ordinary
course
through
the
letters
in
the
are
hurried
quickly
through
the
operation
of
stamping
so
that
one
passing
over
the
other
while
the
stamping
ink
is
still
moist
will
to
some
extent
blot
and
blur
that
with
which
it
has
come
in
contact
he
will
produce
some
dozens
taken
at
random
and
will
show
that
with
them
all
such
has
been
the
case
this
blotting
this
smudging
is
very
slight
but
it
exists
it
is
always
there
he
will
tell
you
that
this
envelope
has
been
stamped
as
one
and
alone
by
itself
with
peculiar
care
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
believe
that
the
impression
has
been
procured
by
fraud
in
the
sydney
if
that
be
so
if
in
such
a
case
as
this
fraud
be
once
discovered
then
i
say
that
the
whole
case
will
fall
to
the
ground
and
that
i
shall
be
justified
in
telling
you
that
no
word
that
you
have
heard
from
these
four
witnesses
is
worthy
of
belief
worthy
of
belief
has
been
adduced
against
my
client
unless
that
envelope
be
so
that
those
four
persons
have
conspired
together
for
the
sake
of
getting
money
is
clear
enough
to
their
evidence
i
shall
come
presently
and
shall
endeavour
to
show
you
why
you
should
discredit
them
at
present
i
am
concerned
simply
with
this
envelope
on
which
i
think
that
the
case
hangs
as
for
the
copy
of
the
register
it
is
nothing
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
in
any
conspiracy
so
much
as
that
could
not
be
brought
up
had
such
a
register
been
found
in
the
archives
of
any
church
however
humble
and
had
an
attested
copy
been
produced
that
would
have
been
much
but
this
is
nothing
nor
is
the
alleged
letter
from
allan
anything
were
the
letter
genuine
it
would
show
that
such
a
marriage
had
been
contemplated
not
that
it
had
been
solemnised
we
have
however
no
evidence
to
make
us
believe
that
the
letter
is
genuine
but
this
envelope
and
he
again
stretched
it
out
towards
the
jury
evidence
the
impression
of
a
stamp
has
often
been
accepted
as
evidence
but
the
evidence
may
be
false
evidence
and
it
is
for
us
to
see
whether
it
may
not
probably
be
so
now
the
first
place
such
evidence
requires
peculiar
sifting
which
unfortunately
can
not
be
applied
to
it
in
the
present
case
because
it
has
been
brought
to
us
from
a
great
distance
had
the
envelope
been
in
our
possession
from
the
moment
in
which
the
accusation
was
first
made
we
might
have
tested
it
either
by
sending
it
to
sydney
or
by
obtaining
from
sydney
other
letters
or
documents
bearing
the
same
stamp
affixed
undoubtedly
on
the
date
here
represented
but
that
has
not
been
within
our
power
the
gentlemen
whom
i
shall
bring
before
you
will
tell
you
that
these
impressions
or
stamps
have
a
knack
of
verifying
themselves
which
makes
it
very
dangerous
indeed
for
fraudulent
persons
to
tamper
with
them
a
stamp
used
in
june
will
be
hardly
the
same
as
it
will
be
in
july
some
little
bruise
will
have
so
altered
a
portion
of
the
surface
as
to
enable
detection
to
be
made
with
a
microscope
and
the
stamp
used
in
will
certainly
have
varied
its
form
in
now
i
maintain
that
time
and
opportunity
should
have
been
given
to
us
to
verify
this
impression
copies
of
all
impressions
from
day
to
day
are
kept
in
the
sydney
and
if
it
be
found
that
on
this
day
named
the
of
may
no
impression
in
the
sydney
office
is
an
exact
facsimile
of
this
impression
then
i
say
that
this
impression
has
been
subsequently
and
fraudulently
obtained
and
that
the
only
morsel
of
corroborative
evidence
offered
to
you
will
be
shown
to
be
false
evidence
we
have
been
unable
to
get
impressions
of
this
date
opportunities
have
not
been
given
to
us
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
that
you
should
demand
such
opportunities
before
you
accept
that
envelope
as
evidence
on
which
you
can
send
my
client
to
jail
and
deprive
that
young
wife
whom
he
has
made
his
own
of
her
husband
and
afford
the
damning
evidence
of
your
verdict
towards
robbing
his
son
of
his
legitimacy
he
said
very
much
more
about
the
envelope
clearly
showing
his
own
appreciation
of
its
importance
and
declaring
again
and
again
that
if
he
could
show
that
a
stain
of
perjury
affected
the
evidence
in
any
one
point
all
the
evidence
must
fall
to
the
ground
and
that
if
there
were
ground
to
suspect
that
the
envelope
had
been
tampered
with
then
that
stain
of
perjury
would
exist
after
that
he
went
on
to
the
four
conspirators
as
he
called
them
justifying
the
name
by
their
acknowledged
object
of
getting
money
from
his
client
they
came
to
this
country
as
conspirators
with
a
fraudulent
purpose
my
learned
friend
will
not
deny
acknowledge
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
learned
friend
my
learned
friend
must
feel
that
his
is
a
case
in
which
he
can
not
safely
acknowledge
anything
i
do
not
doubt
gentlemen
but
that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
on
that
point
he
went
on
to
show
that
they
clearly
were
conspirators
that
they
had
confessed
as
much
themselves
is
no
doubt
possible
that
my
client
may
have
married
this
female
conspirator
and
she
is
not
the
less
entitled
to
protection
from
the
law
because
she
is
a
conspirator
nor
because
she
is
a
conspirator
should
he
be
less
amenable
to
the
law
for
the
terrible
injury
he
would
then
have
done
to
that
other
lady
but
if
they
be
conspirators
if
it
be
shown
to
you
that
they
came
to
this
country
not
that
the
woman
might
claim
her
husband
not
that
the
others
might
give
honest
testimony
against
a
great
delinquent
but
in
order
that
they
might
frighten
him
out
of
money
then
i
am
entitled
to
tell
you
that
you
should
not
rest
on
their
evidence
unless
it
be
supported
and
that
the
fact
of
their
conspiracy
gives
you
a
right
nay
makes
it
your
imperative
duty
to
suspect
perjury
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
taken
up
with
sir
john
speech
and
with
the
witnesses
which
he
called
for
the
defence
he
certainly
succeeded
in
strengthening
the
compassion
which
was
felt
for
caldigate
and
for
the
unfortunate
young
mother
at
folking
was
very
well
he
said
my
learned
friend
to
tell
you
of
the
protection
which
is
due
to
a
married
woman
when
a
husband
has
broken
the
law
and
betrayed
his
trust
by
taking
another
wife
to
himself
as
this
man
is
accused
of
having
done
but
there
is
another
aspect
in
which
you
will
regard
the
question
think
of
that
second
wife
and
of
her
child
and
of
the
protection
which
is
due
to
her
you
well
know
that
she
does
not
suspect
her
husband
that
she
fears
nothing
but
a
mistaken
verdict
from
you
that
she
will
be
satisfied
much
more
than
satisfied
if
you
will
leave
her
in
possession
of
her
home
her
husband
and
the
unalloyed
domestic
happiness
she
has
enjoyed
since
she
joined
her
lot
with
his
look
at
the
one
woman
and
then
at
the
other
remember
their
motives
their
different
lives
their
different
joys
and
what
will
be
the
effect
of
your
verdict
upon
each
of
them
if
you
are
satisfied
that
he
did
marry
that
woman
that
vile
woman
the
nature
of
whose
life
has
been
sufficiently
exposed
to
you
of
course
your
verdict
must
be
against
him
the
law
is
the
law
and
must
be
vindicated
in
that
case
it
will
be
your
duty
your
terrible
duty
to
create
misery
to
destroy
happiness
to
ruin
a
dear
innocent
young
mother
and
her
child
and
to
separate
a
loving
couple
every
detail
of
whose
life
is
such
as
to
demand
your
sympathy
and
this
you
must
do
at
the
bidding
of
four
greedy
foul
conspirators
innocent
sweet
excellent
in
all
feminine
graces
as
is
the
one
wife
unlovely
unfeminine
and
abhorrent
as
is
the
other
you
must
do
your
duty
god
forbid
that
i
should
ask
you
to
break
an
oath
even
for
the
sake
of
that
young
mother
but
in
such
a
case
i
do
think
i
may
ask
you
to
be
very
careful
as
to
what
evidence
you
accept
i
do
think
that
i
may
again
point
out
to
you
that
those
four
witnesses
bound
as
they
are
together
by
a
bond
of
avarice
should
be
regarded
but
as
one
and
as
one
to
whose
sworn
evidence
no
credit
is
due
unless
it
be
amply
corroborated
i
say
that
there
is
no
corroboration
this
envelope
would
be
strong
corroboration
if
it
had
been
itself
trustworthy
when
he
sat
down
the
feeling
in
court
was
certainly
in
favour
of
john
caldigate
then
a
cloud
of
witnesses
were
brought
up
for
the
defence
each
of
whom
however
was
soon
despatched
the
two
clerks
from
the
gave
exactly
the
evidence
which
sir
john
had
described
and
exposed
to
the
jury
their
packet
of
old
letters
in
their
opinion
the
impression
on
the
envelope
was
finer
and
cleaner
than
that
generally
produced
in
the
course
of
business
each
of
them
thought
it
not
improbable
that
the
impression
had
been
surreptitiously
obtained
but
each
of
them
acknowledged
on
that
a
stamp
so
clean
and
perfect
might
be
given
and
maintained
without
special
care
and
each
of
them
said
that
it
was
quite
possible
that
a
letter
passing
through
the
might
escape
the
stamp
of
one
of
the
offices
in
which
it
would
be
manipulated
then
there
came
the
witnesses
as
to
character
and
evidence
was
given
as
to
hester
determination
to
remain
with
the
man
whom
she
believed
to
be
her
husband
as
to
this
there
was
no
that
life
had
been
useful
and
salutary
since
his
return
to
folking
no
one
doubted
nor
that
he
had
been
a
loving
husband
if
he
had
committed
bigamy
it
was
no
doubt
for
the
public
welfare
that
such
a
crime
should
be
exposed
and
punished
but
that
he
should
have
been
a
bigamist
would
be
a
pity
oh
such
a
pity
the
pity
of
it
oh
the
pity
of
it
for
now
there
had
been
much
talk
of
hester
and
her
home
at
folking
and
her
former
home
at
chesterton
and
people
everywhere
concerned
themselves
for
her
peace
for
her
happiness
for
her
condition
of
life
chapter
xliii
the
last
day
after
sir
john
joram
speech
and
when
the
work
of
the
second
day
had
been
brought
to
a
close
caldigate
allowed
his
hopes
to
rise
higher
than
they
had
ever
mounted
since
he
had
first
become
aware
that
the
accusation
would
in
truth
be
brought
against
him
it
seemed
to
be
almost
impossible
that
any
jury
should
give
a
verdict
in
opposition
to
arguments
so
convincing
as
those
sir
john
had
used
all
those
details
which
had
appeared
to
himself
to
be
so
damning
to
his
own
cause
now
melted
away
and
seemed
to
be
of
no
avail
and
even
seely
when
he
came
to
see
his
client
in
the
evening
was
less
oppressive
than
usual
he
did
not
indeed
venture
to
express
hope
but
in
his
hopelessness
he
was
somewhat
more
hopeful
than
before
must
remember
caldigate
he
said
you
have
not
yet
heard
the
judge
and
that
with
such
a
jury
the
judge
will
go
much
further
than
any
advocate
i
never
knew
a
cambridgeshire
jury
refuse
to
be
led
by
judge
bramber
a
cambridgeshire
jury
asked
old
caldigate
why
judge
bramber
especially
are
a
little
timid
i
think
here
in
the
eastern
counties
a
little
wanting
in
an
advocate
in
the
north
of
england
has
a
finer
scope
because
the
people
like
to
move
counter
to
authority
a
lancashire
jury
will
generally
be
unwilling
to
do
what
a
judge
tells
them
and
then
judge
bramber
has
a
peculiar
way
of
telling
a
jury
if
he
has
a
strong
opinion
of
his
own
he
never
leaves
the
jury
in
doubt
about
it
some
judges
are
what
i
call
flabby
caldigate
they
are
a
little
afraid
of
responsibility
and
leave
the
jury
and
the
counsel
to
fight
it
out
among
them
sir
john
did
it
very
well
no
doubt
very
well
he
made
the
best
he
could
of
that
postage
stamp
though
i
know
that
it
will
go
for
much
the
point
most
in
our
favour
is
that
those
australians
are
a
rough
lot
to
look
at
the
woman
has
been
drinking
and
has
lost
her
good
looks
so
that
the
jurymen
wo
be
soft
about
her
caldigate
when
he
heard
this
thought
of
euphemia
smith
on
board
the
goldfinder
when
she
certainly
did
not
drink
when
her
personal
appearance
was
certainly
such
as
might
touch
the
heart
of
any
juryman
gold
and
drink
together
had
so
changed
the
woman
that
he
could
hardly
persuade
himself
that
she
was
that
forlorn
attractive
female
whom
he
had
once
so
nearly
loved
before
he
went
to
bed
caldigate
wrote
to
his
wife
as
he
had
done
also
on
the
preceding
evening
is
to
be
another
long
tedious
terrible
day
and
then
it
may
be
that
i
shall
be
able
to
write
no
more
for
your
sake
almost
more
than
for
my
own
i
am
longing
for
it
to
be
over
it
would
be
vain
for
me
to
attempt
to
tell
you
all
that
took
place
i
do
not
dare
to
give
you
hope
which
i
know
may
be
fallacious
and
yet
i
feel
my
own
heart
somewhat
higher
than
it
was
when
i
wrote
last
night
then
he
did
tell
her
something
of
what
had
taken
place
speaking
in
high
praise
of
sir
john
joram
now
my
own
own
wife
my
real
wife
my
beloved
one
i
have
to
call
you
so
perhaps
for
the
last
time
for
years
if
these
men
shall
choose
to
think
that
i
married
that
woman
we
shall
have
to
be
so
parted
that
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
be
in
our
graves
but
even
then
i
will
not
give
up
all
hope
my
father
has
promised
that
the
whole
colony
shall
be
ransacked
till
proof
be
found
of
the
truth
and
then
though
i
shall
have
been
convicted
i
shall
be
reinstated
in
my
position
as
your
husband
may
god
almighty
bless
you
and
our
boy
till
i
may
come
again
to
claim
my
wife
and
my
child
without
disgrace
the
old
man
had
made
the
promise
would
go
myself
said
he
it
not
that
hester
will
want
my
support
here
for
there
had
been
another
promise
made
that
by
no
entreaty
no
guile
no
force
should
hester
be
taken
from
folking
to
chesterton
early
on
the
third
day
judge
bramber
began
his
charge
and
in
doing
so
he
told
the
jury
that
it
would
occupy
him
about
three
hours
and
in
exactly
three
hours
time
he
had
completed
his
task
in
summing
up
the
case
he
certainly
was
not
so
little
so
that
he
left
no
doubt
on
the
minds
of
any
who
heard
him
of
the
verdict
at
which
he
had
himself
arrived
he
went
through
the
evidence
of
the
four
chief
witnesses
very
carefully
and
then
said
that
the
antecedents
of
these
people
or
even
their
guilt
if
they
had
been
guilty
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
except
in
so
far
as
it
might
affect
the
opinion
of
the
jury
as
to
their
veracity
they
had
been
called
conspirators
even
though
they
had
conspired
to
raise
money
by
threats
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
abominable
even
though
by
doing
so
they
should
have
subjected
themselves
to
criminal
proceedings
and
to
many
penalties
that
would
not
lessen
the
criminality
of
the
accused
if
such
a
marriage
as
that
described
had
in
truth
taken
place
said
the
judge
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
i
should
not
insist
upon
it
had
it
not
been
implied
that
the
testimony
of
these
four
persons
is
worth
nothing
because
they
are
conspirators
it
is
for
you
to
judge
what
their
testimony
is
worth
and
it
is
for
you
to
remember
that
they
are
four
distinct
witnesses
all
swearing
to
the
same
thing
then
he
went
into
the
question
of
the
money
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
four
persons
had
come
to
england
with
the
purpose
of
getting
money
out
of
the
accused
and
that
they
had
succeeded
with
their
mode
of
doing
this
whether
criminal
or
innocent
the
jury
had
nothing
to
do
except
as
it
affected
their
credit
but
they
were
bound
to
look
to
motive
in
paying
so
large
a
sum
it
had
been
shown
that
he
did
not
owe
them
a
shilling
and
that
when
the
application
for
money
reached
him
from
australia
he
had
refused
to
give
them
a
shilling
then
when
they
had
arrived
here
in
england
accusation
was
made
and
when
they
had
offered
to
desert
the
case
if
paid
the
money
then
the
money
was
paid
the
prisoner
when
paying
it
had
no
doubt
intimated
to
those
who
received
it
that
he
made
no
bargain
with
them
as
to
their
going
away
and
he
had
taken
a
friend
with
him
who
had
given
his
evidence
in
court
and
this
friend
had
manifestly
been
taken
to
show
that
the
money
was
not
secretly
paid
the
jury
would
give
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
all
that
if
there
was
benefit
to
be
derived
from
it
but
they
were
bound
to
remember
in
coming
to
their
verdict
that
a
very
large
sum
of
money
had
been
paid
to
the
witnesses
by
the
prisoner
which
money
certainly
was
not
due
to
them
he
dwelt
also
at
great
length
on
the
stamp
on
the
envelope
but
contrived
at
last
to
leave
a
feeling
on
the
minds
of
those
who
heard
him
that
sir
john
had
shown
the
weakness
of
his
case
by
trusting
so
much
to
such
allegations
as
he
had
made
has
been
represented
said
judge
bramber
the
impression
which
you
have
seen
of
the
sydney
stamp
has
been
fraudulently
obtained
some
stronger
evidence
should
i
think
be
shown
of
this
before
you
believe
it
two
clerks
from
the
london
have
told
you
that
they
believed
the
impression
to
be
a
false
one
but
i
think
they
were
hardly
justified
in
their
opinion
they
founded
it
on
the
clearness
and
cleanness
of
the
impression
but
they
both
of
them
acknowledged
afterwards
that
such
clearness
and
cleanness
is
simply
unusual
and
by
no
means
impossible
not
indeed
improbable
but
how
would
it
have
been
if
the
envelope
had
been
brought
to
you
without
any
impression
simply
directed
to
caldigate
by
the
man
who
is
alleged
to
have
made
the
woman
his
wife
shortly
before
the
envelope
was
written
would
it
not
in
that
case
have
been
strong
evidence
if
any
fraud
were
proved
such
a
fraud
as
would
be
that
of
getting
some
official
falsely
to
stamp
the
envelope
then
the
stain
of
perjury
would
be
there
but
it
will
be
for
you
to
consider
whether
you
can
find
such
stain
of
perjury
merely
because
the
impression
on
the
envelope
is
clear
and
clean
when
he
came
to
the
present
condition
of
caldigate
wife
and
child
at
folking
he
was
very
tender
in
his
speech
but
even
his
tenderness
seemed
to
turn
itself
against
the
accused
that
poor
lady
i
can
only
speak
with
that
unfeigned
respect
which
i
am
sure
you
all
feel
that
she
was
happy
in
her
marriage
till
this
accusation
reached
her
ears
no
one
can
doubt
that
he
to
whom
she
was
given
in
marriage
has
done
his
duty
by
her
treating
her
with
full
affection
and
confidence
has
been
proved
to
us
who
can
think
that
such
a
condition
of
things
shall
be
disturbed
that
happiness
so
perfect
is
to
be
turned
to
misery
and
misfortune
without
almost
an
agony
of
regret
but
not
on
that
account
can
you
be
in
any
way
released
from
your
duty
in
this
case
you
are
not
entitled
to
think
of
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
individuals
you
have
to
confine
yourself
to
the
evidence
and
must
give
your
verdict
in
accordance
with
that
john
caldigate
as
he
heard
the
words
told
himself
at
once
that
the
judge
had
in
fact
desired
the
jury
to
find
a
verdict
against
him
not
a
single
point
had
been
made
in
his
favour
and
every
point
had
been
made
to
tell
against
him
the
judge
had
almost
said
that
a
man
promise
to
marry
a
woman
should
be
taken
as
evidence
of
marriage
but
the
jury
at
any
rate
did
not
show
immediate
alacrity
in
obeying
the
behest
they
returned
once
or
twice
to
ask
questions
and
at
three
caldigate
was
allowed
to
go
to
his
inn
with
an
intimation
that
he
must
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
be
brought
back
and
hear
the
verdict
at
a
moment
notice
wish
they
would
declare
it
at
once
he
said
to
his
father
suspense
is
worse
than
all
during
the
afternoon
the
matter
was
discussed
very
freely
throughout
the
borough
thought
they
would
have
agreed
almost
at
once
said
the
mayor
at
about
four
to
seely
who
at
this
moment
had
retired
to
his
own
office
where
the
great
magistrate
of
the
borough
was
closeted
with
him
the
mayor
had
been
seated
on
the
bench
throughout
the
trial
and
had
taken
much
interest
in
the
case
never
imagined
that
there
could
be
much
doubt
after
judge
bramber
summing
up
hear
that
there
one
man
holding
out
said
the
attorney
in
a
low
voice
is
it
whispered
the
mayor
the
mayor
and
seely
were
very
intimate
suppose
it
jones
the
tanner
at
ely
they
say
that
the
caldigates
have
had
dealings
with
his
family
from
generation
to
generation
i
knew
all
about
it
and
when
they
passed
his
name
i
wondered
that
burder
had
been
sharper
burder
was
the
gentleman
who
had
got
up
the
prosecution
on
the
part
of
the
crown
must
be
something
of
that
kind
said
the
mayor
else
would
make
a
jury
hesitate
after
such
a
charge
as
that
i
suppose
he
did
marry
her
seely
shrugged
his
shoulders
have
attended
very
closely
to
the
case
and
i
know
i
should
have
been
against
him
on
a
jury
god
bless
my
soul
did
any
man
ever
write
to
a
woman
as
his
wife
without
having
married
her
has
been
done
i
should
think
that
nobody
should
have
been
got
to
say
that
they
were
man
and
wife
really
have
hardly
formed
an
opinion
said
seely
still
whispering
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
was
probably
some
ceremony
and
that
caldigate
salved
his
conscience
when
he
married
bolton
daughter
by
an
idea
that
the
ceremony
was
valid
but
they
convict
him
at
last
when
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
up
to
town
and
paid
that
money
i
knew
it
was
all
up
with
him
how
can
any
juryman
believe
that
a
man
will
pay
twenty
thousand
pounds
which
he
owe
to
his
sworn
enemy
merely
on
a
point
of
conscience
at
the
same
time
the
old
banker
was
sitting
in
his
room
at
the
bank
and
robert
bolton
was
with
him
can
not
be
a
doubt
of
his
guilt
said
robert
bolton
no
not
a
doubt
the
jury
may
disagree
shall
we
do
then
said
the
banker
must
be
another
trial
we
must
go
on
till
we
get
a
verdict
hester
what
can
we
do
for
hester
is
very
obstinate
and
i
fear
we
have
no
power
even
though
she
is
declared
not
to
be
his
wife
she
can
choose
her
own
place
of
living
if
he
is
convicted
i
think
that
she
would
come
back
of
course
she
ought
to
come
back
course
of
course
caldigate
too
is
very
obstinate
but
it
may
be
that
we
should
be
able
to
persuade
him
he
will
know
that
she
ought
to
be
with
her
mother
poor
mother
her
poor
mother
and
when
he
comes
out
of
prison
very
nature
will
have
been
altered
by
that
time
said
the
attorney
will
i
trust
have
consented
before
that
to
take
up
her
residence
under
your
roof
shall
be
dead
said
the
old
man
and
years
together
will
have
killed
me
before
that
time
comes
the
smirkies
were
staying
at
babington
and
the
desire
for
news
there
was
very
intent
smirkie
was
full
of
thought
on
the
matter
but
was
manifestly
in
favour
of
a
conviction
the
poor
young
woman
is
very
much
to
be
pitied
he
said
in
answer
to
the
squire
who
had
ventured
to
utter
a
word
in
favour
of
hester
young
woman
who
falls
into
the
hands
of
an
evil
man
must
always
be
pitied
but
it
is
to
prevent
the
evil
men
from
preying
upon
the
weaker
sex
that
examples
such
as
these
are
needed
when
we
think
what
might
have
been
the
case
here
in
this
house
we
have
all
of
us
a
peculiar
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
interposition
of
divine
providence
here
smirkie
made
a
little
gesture
of
thanksgiving
thanking
heaven
for
its
goodness
to
his
wife
in
having
given
her
himself
my
love
you
have
a
very
peculiar
reason
to
be
thankful
and
i
trust
you
are
so
yes
we
must
pity
the
poor
young
lady
but
it
will
be
well
that
the
offender
should
be
made
subject
to
the
outraged
laws
of
his
country
smirkie
as
she
listened
to
these
eloquent
words
closed
her
eyes
and
hands
in
token
of
her
thankfulness
for
all
that
providence
had
done
for
her
if
she
knew
how
to
compare
her
condition
with
that
of
poor
hester
at
this
time
she
had
indeed
cause
for
thankfulness
hester
was
alone
with
her
baby
and
with
no
information
but
what
had
been
conveyed
to
her
by
her
husband
letters
as
she
read
the
last
of
the
two
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
too
probably
she
would
not
even
see
his
handwriting
again
till
the
period
of
his
punishment
should
have
expired
and
then
what
would
come
then
sitting
alone
at
the
open
window
of
her
with
her
boy
on
her
lap
she
endeavoured
to
realise
her
own
position
she
would
be
a
mother
without
a
husband
with
her
bastard
child
however
innocent
he
might
be
such
would
be
her
position
under
the
law
it
did
not
suffice
that
they
too
should
be
man
and
wife
as
thoroughly
as
any
whom
god
had
joined
together
if
twelve
men
assembled
together
in
a
should
say
otherwise
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
be
brave
but
how
should
she
be
brave
in
such
a
condition
as
this
what
should
she
do
how
should
she
look
forward
to
the
time
of
his
release
could
anything
ever
again
give
her
back
her
husband
and
make
him
her
own
in
the
eyes
of
men
could
anything
make
men
believe
that
he
had
always
been
her
own
and
that
there
had
been
no
flaw
she
had
been
very
brave
when
they
had
attempted
to
confine
her
to
hold
her
by
force
at
chesterton
then
she
had
been
made
strong
had
always
been
comforted
by
opposition
the
determination
of
her
purpose
to
go
back
had
supported
her
but
now
how
should
it
be
with
her
now
and
with
her
boy
and
with
him
the
old
man
was
very
good
good
and
eager
in
her
cause
and
would
let
her
live
at
folking
but
what
would
they
call
her
when
they
wrote
to
her
from
chesterton
how
would
they
address
her
letters
never
never
would
she
soil
her
fingers
by
touching
a
document
that
called
her
by
any
other
name
than
her
own
yes
her
own
let
all
the
jurymen
in
all
the
counties
let
all
the
judges
on
the
bench
say
what
they
would
to
the
contrary
though
it
should
be
for
all
her
life
though
there
should
never
come
the
day
on
which
they
they
the
world
at
large
would
do
him
justice
and
her
though
they
should
call
her
by
what
hard
name
they
would
still
up
there
in
the
courts
of
her
god
she
would
be
his
wife
she
would
be
a
pure
woman
there
and
there
would
her
child
be
without
a
stain
and
here
here
in
this
world
though
she
could
never
more
be
a
wife
in
all
things
she
would
be
a
wife
in
love
a
wife
in
care
a
wife
in
obedience
a
wife
in
all
godly
truth
and
though
it
would
never
be
possible
for
her
to
show
her
face
again
among
mankind
never
for
her
surely
the
world
would
be
kinder
to
her
boy
they
would
not
begrudge
him
his
name
and
when
it
should
be
told
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
there
was
a
blot
upon
his
escutcheon
they
would
not
remind
him
of
his
mother
misery
but
above
all
there
should
be
no
shade
of
doubt
as
to
her
husband
know
she
said
speaking
aloud
but
not
knowing
that
she
spoke
aloud
know
that
he
is
my
husband
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
yes
has
it
come
do
you
know
no
nothing
was
known
there
at
that
moment
but
in
another
minute
all
would
be
known
the
wheels
of
the
old
squire
carriage
had
been
heard
upon
the
gravel
no
you
shall
not
leave
the
room
said
the
nurse
here
and
let
him
come
to
you
he
alone
she
asked
but
the
woman
did
not
know
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
had
only
been
heard
alas
alas
he
was
alone
his
heart
too
had
been
almost
broken
as
he
bore
the
news
home
to
the
wife
who
was
a
wife
no
longer
she
said
when
she
saw
him
daughter
o
my
daughter
and
then
with
their
hands
clasped
together
they
sat
speechless
and
alone
while
the
news
was
spread
through
the
household
which
the
old
man
did
not
dare
to
tell
to
his
son
wife
it
was
very
slowly
that
the
actual
tidings
reached
her
ears
caldigate
when
he
tried
to
tell
them
found
that
the
power
of
words
had
left
him
old
as
he
was
and
prone
to
cynic
indifference
as
he
had
shown
himself
he
was
affected
almost
like
a
young
girl
he
sobbed
convulsively
as
he
hung
over
her
embracing
her
daughter
he
said
daughter
my
daughter
but
at
last
it
was
all
told
caldigate
had
been
declared
guilty
and
the
judge
had
condemned
him
to
be
confined
to
prison
for
two
years
judge
bramber
had
told
him
that
in
his
opinion
the
jury
could
have
found
no
other
verdict
but
he
went
on
to
say
that
looking
for
some
excuse
for
so
terrible
a
deed
as
that
which
had
been
done
so
terrible
for
that
poor
lady
who
was
now
left
nameless
with
a
nameless
infant
he
could
imagine
that
the
marriage
though
legally
solemnised
had
nevertheless
been
so
deficient
in
the
appearances
of
solemnity
as
to
have
imbued
the
husband
with
the
idea
that
it
had
not
meant
all
that
a
marriage
would
have
meant
if
celebrated
in
a
church
and
with
more
of
the
outward
appurtenances
of
religion
on
that
account
he
refrained
from
inflicting
a
severer
penalty
chapter
xliv
after
the
verdict
when
the
verdict
was
given
caldigate
was
at
once
marched
round
into
the
dock
having
hitherto
been
allowed
to
sit
in
front
of
the
dock
between
seely
and
his
father
but
standing
in
the
dock
he
heard
the
sentence
pronounced
upon
him
never
married
the
woman
my
lord
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
but
what
he
said
could
be
of
no
avail
and
then
men
looked
at
him
as
he
disappeared
with
the
jailers
down
the
steps
leading
to
regions
below
and
away
to
his
prison
and
they
knew
that
he
would
no
more
be
seen
or
heard
of
for
two
years
he
had
vanished
but
there
was
the
lady
who
was
not
his
wife
out
at
folking
the
lady
whom
the
jury
had
declared
not
to
be
his
wife
what
would
become
of
her
there
was
an
old
gentleman
there
in
the
court
who
had
known
caldigate
for
many
years
one
ryder
who
had
been
himself
a
practising
barrister
but
had
now
retired
in
those
days
they
seldom
saw
each
other
but
nevertheless
they
were
friends
he
said
had
better
let
her
go
back
to
her
own
people
shall
stay
with
me
he
replied
not
believe
me
she
had
better
not
if
so
how
will
it
be
with
her
when
he
is
released
the
two
years
will
soon
go
by
and
then
she
will
be
in
his
house
if
that
woman
should
die
he
might
marry
her
but
till
then
she
had
better
be
with
her
own
people
shall
stay
with
me
the
old
man
said
again
repeating
the
words
angrily
and
shaking
his
head
he
was
so
stunned
by
the
blow
that
he
could
not
argue
the
matter
but
he
knew
that
he
had
made
the
promise
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
abide
by
it
she
had
better
go
back
to
her
own
people
all
the
world
was
saying
it
she
had
no
husband
now
everybody
would
respect
her
misfortune
everybody
would
acknowledge
her
innocence
all
would
sympathise
with
her
all
would
love
her
but
she
must
go
back
to
her
own
people
there
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
course
she
must
go
back
to
you
now
nicholas
bolton
said
to
her
father
and
nicholas
bolton
seldom
interfered
in
anything
poor
lady
will
of
course
be
restored
to
her
family
the
judge
had
said
in
private
to
his
marshal
and
the
marshal
had
of
course
made
known
what
the
judge
had
said
on
the
next
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
william
bolton
to
robert
course
hester
must
come
back
now
nothing
else
is
possible
everybody
decided
that
she
must
come
back
it
was
a
matter
which
admitted
of
no
doubt
but
how
was
she
to
be
brought
to
chesterton
none
of
them
who
decided
with
so
much
confidence
as
to
her
future
understood
her
ideas
of
her
position
as
a
wife
am
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
she
said
to
herself
so
by
a
sacrament
which
no
jury
can
touch
what
matters
what
the
people
say
they
may
make
me
more
unhappy
than
i
am
they
may
kill
me
by
their
cruelty
but
they
can
not
make
me
believe
myself
not
to
be
his
wife
and
while
i
am
his
wife
i
will
obey
him
and
him
only
what
she
called
cruelty
manifested
itself
very
soon
the
first
person
who
came
to
her
was
robert
bolton
and
her
visit
was
made
on
the
day
after
the
verdict
when
hester
sent
down
word
begging
to
be
permitted
in
her
misery
to
decline
to
see
even
her
robert
sent
her
up
a
word
or
two
written
in
pencil
darling
whom
have
you
nearer
who
loves
you
better
than
i
then
the
wretched
one
gave
way
and
allowed
her
brother
wife
to
be
brought
to
her
she
was
already
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
black
and
her
baby
was
with
her
the
arguments
which
robert
bolton
used
need
not
be
repeated
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
words
she
used
were
so
tender
and
that
they
were
urged
with
so
much
love
so
much
sympathy
and
so
much
personal
approval
that
hester
heart
was
touched
he
is
my
husband
hester
said
judge
can
not
alter
it
he
is
my
husband
will
not
say
a
word
to
the
contrary
but
the
law
has
separated
you
and
you
should
obey
the
law
you
should
not
even
eat
his
bread
now
because
because
oh
hester
you
understand
do
understand
she
said
rising
to
her
feet
in
her
energy
i
will
eat
his
bread
though
it
be
hard
and
i
will
drink
of
his
cup
though
it
be
bitter
his
bread
and
his
cup
shall
be
mine
and
none
other
shall
be
mine
i
do
understand
i
know
that
these
wicked
people
have
blasted
my
life
i
know
that
i
can
be
nothing
to
him
now
but
his
child
shall
never
be
made
to
think
that
his
mother
had
condemned
his
father
yes
margaret
she
said
again
do
love
you
and
i
do
trust
you
and
i
know
that
you
love
me
but
you
do
not
love
him
you
do
not
believe
in
him
if
they
came
to
you
and
took
robert
away
would
you
go
and
live
with
other
people
i
do
love
papa
and
mamma
but
this
is
his
house
and
he
bids
me
stay
here
the
very
clothes
which
i
wear
are
his
clothes
i
am
his
and
though
they
were
to
cut
me
apart
from
him
still
i
should
belong
to
him
no
i
will
not
go
to
mamma
of
course
i
have
forgiven
her
because
she
meant
it
for
the
best
but
i
will
never
go
back
to
chesterton
then
there
came
letters
from
the
mother
one
letter
hot
upon
the
other
all
appealing
to
those
texts
in
scripture
by
which
the
laws
of
nations
are
supposed
to
be
supported
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
caesar
it
was
for
the
law
to
declare
who
were
and
who
were
not
man
and
wife
and
in
this
matter
the
law
had
declared
after
this
how
could
she
doubt
or
how
could
she
hesitate
as
to
tearing
herself
away
from
the
belongings
of
the
man
who
certainly
was
not
her
husband
and
there
were
dreadful
words
in
these
letters
which
added
much
to
the
agony
of
her
who
received
them
words
which
were
used
in
order
that
their
strength
might
prevail
but
they
had
no
strength
to
convert
though
they
had
strength
to
afflict
then
bolton
who
in
her
anxiety
was
ready
to
submit
herself
to
any
personal
discomfort
prepared
to
go
to
folking
but
hester
sent
back
word
that
in
her
present
condition
she
would
see
nobody
not
even
her
mother
but
it
was
not
only
from
the
family
of
the
boltons
that
these
applications
and
entreaties
came
even
seely
took
upon
himself
to
tell
caldigate
that
under
existing
circumstances
hester
should
not
be
detained
at
folking
do
not
know
that
either
she
or
i
want
advice
in
the
matter
caldigate
replied
but
as
a
stone
will
be
worn
hollow
in
time
by
the
droppings
of
many
waters
so
was
it
thought
that
if
all
cambridge
would
continue
firm
in
its
purpose
then
this
stone
might
at
last
be
made
to
yield
the
world
was
so
anxious
that
it
resolved
among
itself
that
it
would
submit
to
any
amount
of
snubbing
in
carrying
out
its
object
even
the
mayor
wrote
caldigate
greatly
as
i
object
to
all
interference
in
families
i
think
myself
bound
to
appeal
to
you
as
to
the
unfortunate
condition
of
that
young
lady
from
chesterton
then
followed
all
the
arguments
and
some
of
the
texts
both
of
which
were
gradually
becoming
hackneyed
in
the
matter
caldigate
answer
to
this
was
very
characteristic
mayor
if
you
have
an
objection
to
interfere
in
families
why
do
you
do
it
the
mayor
took
the
rebuke
with
placid
feeling
that
his
little
drop
might
also
have
done
something
towards
hollowing
the
stone
but
of
all
the
counsellors
perhaps
smirkie
was
the
most
zealous
and
the
most
trusting
he
felt
himself
to
be
bound
in
a
peculiar
manner
to
folking
by
double
ties
was
not
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
the
brother
of
his
dear
departed
one
and
with
whom
better
could
he
hold
sweet
counsel
and
then
that
second
dear
one
who
had
just
been
vouchsafed
to
him
had
she
not
as
it
were
by
a
miracle
been
rescued
from
the
fate
into
which
the
other
poor
lady
had
fallen
and
obtained
her
present
thoroughly
satisfactory
position
smirkie
was
a
clergyman
who
understood
it
to
be
his
duty
to
be
urgent
for
the
good
cause
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
who
always
did
his
duty
so
he
travelled
over
to
utterden
and
discussed
the
matter
at
great
length
with
bromley
do
believe
in
my
heart
said
bromley
the
verdict
is
wrong
but
smirkie
with
much
eloquence
averred
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
bromley
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
all
said
smirkie
is
the
verdict
of
the
jury
confirmed
by
the
judge
and
the
verdict
itself
dissolves
the
marriage
whether
the
verdict
be
wrong
or
right
that
marriage
ceremony
is
null
and
void
they
are
not
man
and
wife
not
now
even
if
they
ever
were
of
course
you
are
aware
of
that
smirkie
was
altogether
wrong
in
his
law
such
men
generally
are
bromley
in
vain
endeavoured
to
point
out
to
him
that
the
verdict
could
have
no
such
power
as
was
here
claimed
for
it
and
that
if
any
claim
was
to
be
brought
up
hereafter
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
child
the
fact
of
the
verdict
could
only
be
used
as
evidence
and
that
that
evidence
would
or
would
not
be
regarded
as
true
by
another
jury
according
to
the
views
which
that
other
jury
might
take
smirkie
would
only
repeat
his
statements
with
increased
solemnity
marriage
is
no
marriage
that
poor
lady
is
not
john
caldigate
she
is
miss
hester
bolton
and
therefore
every
breath
of
air
which
she
draws
under
that
roof
is
a
sin
as
he
said
this
out
upon
the
he
looked
about
him
with
manifest
regret
that
he
had
no
other
audience
than
his
and
at
last
after
much
persevering
assiduity
smirkie
succeeded
in
reaching
caldigate
himself
and
expressed
himself
with
boldness
he
was
a
man
who
had
at
any
rate
the
courage
of
his
opinions
have
to
think
of
her
future
life
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
he
said
in
the
next
he
repeated
with
emphasis
when
caldigate
paused
to
what
will
affect
her
happiness
in
this
world
sir
said
the
old
man
very
gravely
think
you
can
hardly
be
a
judge
repute
suggested
the
clergyman
she
done
anything
that
ought
to
lessen
the
fair
fame
of
a
woman
in
the
estimation
of
other
women
and
as
to
the
next
world
in
the
rewards
and
punishments
of
which
you
presume
it
to
be
your
peculiar
duty
to
deal
has
she
done
anything
which
you
think
will
subject
her
to
the
special
wrath
of
an
offended
deity
this
question
he
asked
with
a
vehemence
of
voice
which
astounded
his
companion
has
loved
her
husband
with
a
peculiar
love
he
continued
has
believed
herself
to
be
joined
to
him
by
ties
which
you
shall
call
romantic
if
you
will
superstitious
if
you
will
hope
not
i
hope
not
said
smirkie
holding
up
both
his
hands
not
at
all
understanding
the
old
man
meaning
but
intending
to
express
horror
at
which
he
supposed
to
be
a
peculiar
attribute
of
the
roman
catholic
branch
of
the
christian
church
that
i
hope
can
not
fathom
and
you
apparently
can
not
at
all
understand
her
idea
of
the
sanctity
of
the
marriage
vow
but
if
you
knew
anything
about
her
i
think
you
would
refrain
from
threatening
her
with
divine
wrath
and
as
you
know
nothing
about
her
i
regard
such
threats
coming
from
you
as
impertinent
unmanly
inhuman
and
blasphemous
caldigate
had
commenced
this
conversation
though
vehemently
still
in
so
argumentative
a
manner
and
in
his
allusions
to
the
lady
romantic
and
superstitious
ideas
had
seemed
to
yield
so
much
that
the
terrible
vigour
of
his
last
words
struck
the
poor
clergyman
almost
to
the
ground
one
epithet
came
out
after
another
very
clearly
spoken
with
a
pause
between
each
of
them
and
the
speaker
as
he
uttered
them
looked
his
victim
close
in
the
face
then
he
walked
slowly
away
leaving
smirkie
fixed
to
the
ground
what
had
he
done
he
had
simply
made
a
gentle
allusion
to
the
next
world
as
surely
it
was
his
duty
to
do
whether
this
old
pagan
did
or
did
not
believe
in
a
next
world
himself
he
must
at
any
rate
be
aware
that
it
is
the
peculiar
business
of
a
clergyman
to
make
such
references
as
to
and
he
would
let
them
go
by
he
was
he
conceived
bound
by
his
calling
to
be
what
people
called
impertinent
and
manliness
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
and
blasphemous
why
had
he
come
all
the
way
over
from
at
considerable
personal
expense
except
in
furtherance
of
that
highest
humanity
which
concerns
itself
with
eternity
and
as
for
blasphemy
it
might
he
thought
as
well
be
said
that
he
was
blasphemous
whenever
he
read
the
bible
aloud
to
his
flock
his
first
idea
was
to
write
an
exhaustive
letter
on
the
subject
to
caldigate
in
which
he
would
invite
that
gentleman
to
recall
the
offensive
words
but
as
he
drove
his
gig
into
the
parsonage
yard
at
he
made
up
his
mind
that
this
too
was
among
the
things
which
a
christian
minister
should
bear
with
patience
but
the
dropping
water
always
does
hollow
the
stone
hollow
it
a
little
though
the
impression
may
not
be
visible
to
the
naked
eye
even
when
rising
in
his
wrath
caldigate
had
crushed
the
clergyman
by
the
violence
of
his
language
having
been
excited
to
anger
chiefly
by
the
of
the
man
in
not
having
understood
the
rebuke
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
his
earlier
and
gentler
words
even
when
leaving
the
man
with
a
full
conviction
that
the
man
was
crushed
the
old
squire
was
aware
that
he
the
stone
was
being
gradually
hollowed
hester
was
now
very
dear
to
him
from
the
first
she
had
suited
his
ideas
of
a
wife
for
his
son
and
her
constancy
in
her
misery
had
wound
itself
into
his
heart
he
quite
understood
that
her
welfare
should
now
be
his
great
care
there
was
no
one
else
from
whom
she
would
listen
to
a
word
of
advice
from
her
husband
whose
slightest
word
would
have
been
a
law
to
her
no
word
could
now
come
from
her
own
family
she
was
entirely
estranged
having
been
taught
to
regard
them
simply
as
enemies
in
this
matter
she
loved
her
mother
but
in
this
matter
her
mother
was
her
declared
enemy
his
voice
and
his
voice
alone
could
now
reach
her
ears
as
to
that
great
hereafter
to
which
the
clergyman
had
so
flippantly
alluded
he
was
content
to
leave
that
to
herself
much
as
he
differed
from
her
as
to
details
of
a
creed
he
felt
sure
that
she
was
safe
there
to
his
thinking
she
was
the
purest
human
being
that
had
ever
come
beneath
his
notice
whatever
portion
of
bliss
there
may
be
for
mankind
in
a
life
after
this
life
the
fullest
portion
of
that
bliss
would
be
hers
whether
by
reason
of
her
creed
or
in
spite
of
it
accustomed
to
think
much
of
things
it
was
thus
that
he
thought
of
her
in
reference
to
the
world
to
come
but
as
to
this
world
he
was
not
quite
so
sure
if
she
could
die
and
have
that
other
bliss
at
once
that
would
be
best
only
for
the
child
only
for
the
child
but
he
did
doubt
would
it
do
for
her
to
ignore
that
verdict
altogether
when
his
son
should
be
released
from
jail
and
be
to
him
as
though
there
had
been
no
verdict
would
not
the
finger
of
scorn
be
pointed
at
her
and
as
he
thought
of
it
possibly
at
future
children
might
it
not
be
better
for
her
to
bow
to
the
cruelty
of
fate
and
consent
to
be
apart
from
him
at
any
rate
while
that
woman
should
be
alive
and
again
if
such
would
be
better
then
was
it
not
clear
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
beginning
that
new
life
if
at
last
it
should
be
ruled
that
she
must
go
back
to
her
mother
it
would
certainly
be
well
that
she
should
do
so
now
at
once
so
that
people
might
know
that
she
had
yielded
to
the
verdict
in
this
way
the
stone
was
hollowed
though
the
hollowing
had
not
been
made
visible
to
the
naked
eye
of
smirkie
he
was
a
man
whose
conscience
did
not
easily
let
him
rest
when
he
believed
that
a
duty
was
incumbent
on
him
it
was
his
duty
now
he
thought
not
to
bid
her
go
not
to
advise
her
to
go
but
to
put
before
her
what
reasons
there
might
be
for
her
going
am
telling
you
he
said
other
people
say
do
not
regard
what
other
people
say
might
be
possible
for
a
man
hester
but
a
woman
has
to
regard
what
the
world
says
you
are
young
and
may
have
a
long
life
before
you
we
can
not
hide
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
a
most
terrible
misfortune
has
fallen
upon
you
altogether
undeserved
but
very
grievous
when
he
gave
me
my
husband
she
replied
me
more
good
than
any
man
can
do
me
harm
by
taking
him
away
i
never
cease
to
tell
myself
that
the
blessing
is
greater
than
the
misfortune
my
dearest
know
it
all
father
i
know
what
you
would
tell
me
if
i
live
here
after
he
comes
out
of
prison
people
will
say
that
i
am
his
mistress
that
not
that
he
cried
unable
to
bear
the
contumely
of
the
word
even
from
her
lips
father
that
is
what
you
mean
that
is
what
they
all
mean
that
is
what
mamma
means
and
margaret
let
them
call
me
what
they
will
it
is
not
what
they
call
me
but
what
i
am
it
is
bad
for
a
woman
to
have
evil
said
of
her
but
it
is
worse
for
her
to
do
evil
it
is
your
house
and
you
of
course
can
bid
me
go
will
never
do
that
unless
i
am
turned
out
homeless
on
to
the
roads
i
will
stay
here
where
he
left
me
i
have
only
one
sure
way
of
doing
right
and
that
is
to
obey
him
as
closely
as
i
can
he
can
not
order
me
now
but
he
has
left
his
orders
he
has
told
me
to
remain
under
this
roof
and
to
call
myself
by
his
name
and
in
no
way
to
derogate
from
my
own
honour
as
his
wife
by
god
help
i
will
do
as
he
bids
me
nothing
that
any
of
them
can
say
shall
turn
me
an
inch
from
the
way
he
has
pointed
out
you
are
good
to
me
will
try
to
be
good
to
you
are
so
good
to
me
that
i
can
hardly
understand
your
goodness
trusting
to
that
i
will
wait
here
till
he
shall
come
again
and
tell
me
where
and
how
i
am
to
live
after
that
the
old
squire
made
no
further
attempt
in
the
same
direction
finding
that
no
slightest
hollow
had
been
made
on
that
other
stone
chapter
xlv
the
boltons
are
much
troubled
the
condition
of
the
inhabitants
of
puritan
grange
during
the
six
weeks
immediately
after
the
verdict
was
very
sad
indeed
i
have
described
badly
the
character
of
the
lady
living
there
if
i
have
induced
my
readers
to
think
that
her
heart
was
hardened
against
her
daughter
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
convictions
and
bitter
prejudices
but
her
heart
was
soft
enough
when
she
married
circumstances
had
separated
her
widely
from
her
own
family
in
which
she
had
never
known
either
a
brother
or
a
sister
and
the
burden
of
her
marriage
with
an
old
man
had
been
brightened
to
her
by
the
possession
of
an
only
child
of
one
daughter
who
had
been
the
lamp
of
her
life
the
solitary
delight
of
her
heart
the
single
relief
to
the
otherwise
solitary
tedium
of
her
monotonous
existence
she
had
indeed
attended
to
the
religious
training
of
her
girl
with
constant
care
but
the
yearnings
of
her
maternal
heart
had
softened
even
her
religion
so
that
the
laws
and
dogmas
and
texts
and
exercises
by
which
her
husband
was
oppressed
and
her
servants
afflicted
had
been
made
lighter
for
hester
sometimes
not
without
pangs
of
conscience
on
the
part
of
the
parent
she
had
known
as
well
as
other
mothers
how
to
gloat
over
the
sweet
charms
of
the
one
thing
which
in
all
the
world
had
been
quite
her
own
she
had
revelled
in
kisses
and
soft
touches
her
hester
garments
had
been
a
delight
to
her
till
she
had
taught
herself
to
think
that
though
sackcloth
and
ashes
were
the
proper
wear
for
herself
and
her
husband
nothing
was
too
soft
too
silken
too
delicate
for
her
little
girl
the
roses
in
the
garden
and
the
goldfish
in
the
bowl
and
the
pet
spaniel
had
been
there
because
such
surroundings
had
been
needed
for
the
joyousness
of
her
girl
and
the
theological
hardness
of
the
literature
of
the
house
had
been
somewhat
mitigated
as
hester
grew
into
reading
so
that
watt
was
occasionally
relieved
by
wordsworth
and
was
alternated
with
george
withers
then
had
come
first
the
idea
of
the
marriage
and
immediately
consequent
upon
the
idea
the
marriage
itself
the
story
of
that
has
been
told
but
the
reader
has
perhaps
hardly
been
made
to
understand
the
utter
bereavement
which
it
brought
on
the
mother
it
is
natural
that
the
adult
bird
should
delight
to
leave
the
family
nest
and
that
the
mother
bird
should
have
its
torn
by
the
separation
it
must
be
so
alas
even
when
the
divulsions
are
made
in
the
happiest
manner
but
here
the
tearing
away
had
nothing
in
it
to
reconcile
the
mother
she
was
suddenly
told
that
her
daughter
was
to
be
no
longer
her
own
her
had
interfered
and
her
husband
had
become
powerful
over
her
with
a
sudden
obstinacy
she
had
had
no
hand
in
the
choice
she
would
fain
have
postponed
any
choice
and
would
then
fain
have
herself
made
the
choice
but
a
man
was
brought
who
was
distasteful
to
her
at
all
points
and
she
was
told
that
that
man
was
to
have
her
daughter
he
was
thoroughly
distasteful
he
had
been
a
spendthrift
and
a
gambler
then
a
seeker
after
gold
in
wild
godless
countries
and
to
her
thinking
not
at
all
the
better
because
he
had
been
a
successful
seeker
she
believed
the
man
to
be
an
atheist
she
was
told
that
his
father
was
an
infidel
and
was
ready
to
believe
the
worst
of
the
son
and
yet
in
this
terrible
emergency
she
was
powerless
the
girl
was
allowed
to
see
the
man
and
declared
almost
at
once
that
she
would
transfer
herself
from
her
mother
keeping
to
the
keeping
of
this
wicked
one
she
was
transferred
and
the
mother
had
been
left
alone
then
came
the
blow
very
quickly
the
blow
which
as
she
now
told
herself
morning
noon
and
night
was
no
worse
than
she
had
expected
another
woman
claimed
the
man
as
her
husband
and
so
claimed
him
that
the
world
all
around
her
had
declared
that
the
claim
would
be
made
good
and
the
man
himself
had
owned
enough
to
make
him
unfit
as
she
thought
to
have
the
custody
of
any
honest
woman
then
she
acknowledged
to
herself
the
full
weight
of
the
misfortune
that
had
fallen
upon
them
the
misfortune
which
never
would
have
fallen
upon
them
had
they
listened
to
her
counsel
and
she
had
immediately
put
her
shoulders
to
the
wheel
with
the
object
of
rescuing
her
child
from
the
perils
from
the
sin
from
the
degradation
of
her
position
and
could
she
have
rescued
her
could
she
have
induced
her
daughter
to
remain
at
puritan
grange
there
would
even
then
have
been
consolation
it
was
one
of
the
tenets
of
her
life
the
strongest
perhaps
of
all
those
doctrines
on
which
she
built
her
faith
that
this
world
is
a
world
of
woe
that
wailing
and
suffering
if
not
gnashing
of
teeth
is
and
should
be
the
condition
of
mankind
preparatory
to
eternal
bliss
for
eternal
bliss
there
could
she
thought
be
no
other
preparation
she
did
not
want
to
be
happy
here
or
to
have
those
happy
around
her
whom
she
loved
she
had
stumbled
and
gone
astray
she
told
herself
hourly
now
that
she
had
stumbled
and
gone
astray
in
preparing
those
roses
and
ribbons
and
other
lightnesses
for
her
young
girl
it
should
have
been
all
sackcloth
and
ashes
had
it
been
all
sackcloth
and
ashes
there
would
not
have
been
this
terrible
fall
but
if
the
loved
one
would
now
come
back
to
sackcloth
and
ashes
if
she
would
assent
to
the
blackness
of
religious
asceticism
to
penitence
and
theological
gloom
and
would
lead
the
life
of
the
godly
but
comfortless
here
in
order
that
she
might
insure
the
glories
and
joys
of
the
future
life
then
there
might
be
consolation
then
it
might
be
felt
that
this
tribulation
had
been
a
precious
balm
by
which
an
erring
soul
had
been
brought
back
to
its
due
humility
but
wordsworth
and
thomson
though
upon
the
whole
moral
poets
had
done
their
work
or
if
not
done
altogether
by
them
the
work
had
been
done
by
the
latitude
which
had
admitted
them
so
that
the
young
wife
when
she
found
herself
breathing
the
free
air
with
which
her
husband
surrounded
her
was
able
to
burst
asunder
the
remnants
of
those
cords
of
fanaticism
with
which
her
mother
had
endeavoured
to
constrain
her
she
looked
abroad
and
soon
taught
herself
to
feel
that
the
world
was
bright
and
merry
that
this
mortal
life
was
by
no
means
necessarily
a
place
of
gloom
and
the
companionship
of
the
man
to
whom
providence
had
allotted
her
was
to
her
so
happy
so
enjoyable
so
sufficient
that
she
found
herself
to
have
escaped
from
a
dark
prison
and
to
be
roaming
among
shrubs
and
flowers
and
running
waters
which
were
ever
green
which
never
faded
and
the
music
of
which
was
always
in
her
ears
when
the
first
tidings
of
euphemia
smith
came
to
folking
she
was
in
all
her
thoughts
and
theories
of
life
poles
asunder
from
her
mother
there
might
be
suffering
and
tribulation
suffering
even
to
death
but
her
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
the
suffering
should
be
endured
and
death
awaited
was
altogether
opposed
to
that
which
was
hot
within
her
mother
bosom
but
not
the
less
did
the
mother
still
pray
still
struggle
and
still
hope
they
neither
of
them
quite
understood
each
other
but
the
mother
did
not
at
all
understand
the
daughter
she
the
mother
knew
what
the
verdict
had
been
and
was
taught
to
believe
that
by
that
verdict
the
very
ceremony
of
her
daughter
marriage
had
been
rendered
null
and
void
it
was
in
vain
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
came
to
her
from
robert
bolton
diluted
through
the
vague
explanations
of
her
husband
does
not
alter
the
marriage
robert
says
so
it
was
that
the
old
man
told
his
tale
not
perfectly
understanding
not
even
quite
believing
what
his
son
had
told
him
can
he
dare
to
say
so
demanded
the
indignant
mother
of
the
injured
woman
alter
the
marriage
when
the
jury
have
declared
that
the
other
woman
is
his
wife
in
the
eyes
of
god
she
is
not
his
wife
that
can
not
be
imputed
as
sin
to
her
not
that
because
she
did
it
not
knowing
she
poor
innocent
was
betrayed
but
now
that
she
knows
it
every
mouthful
that
she
eats
of
his
bread
is
a
sin
is
the
old
man
bread
said
this
older
man
weakly
matter
it
is
the
bread
of
adultery
it
may
certainly
be
said
that
at
this
time
bolton
herself
would
have
been
relieved
from
none
of
her
sufferings
by
any
new
evidence
which
would
have
shown
that
crinkett
and
the
others
had
sworn
falsely
though
she
loved
her
daughter
dearly
though
her
daughter
misery
made
her
miserable
yet
she
did
not
wish
to
restore
the
husband
to
the
wife
any
allusion
to
a
possibility
that
the
verdict
had
been
a
mistaken
verdict
was
distasteful
to
her
her
own
original
opinion
respecting
caldigate
had
been
made
good
by
the
verdict
the
verdict
had
proved
her
to
be
right
and
her
husband
with
all
his
sons
to
have
been
wrong
the
triumph
had
been
very
dark
to
her
but
still
it
had
been
a
triumph
it
was
to
her
an
established
fact
that
john
caldigate
was
not
her
daughter
husband
and
therefore
she
was
anxious
not
to
rehabilitate
her
daughter
position
but
to
receive
her
own
miserable
child
once
more
beneath
the
shelter
of
her
own
wing
that
they
two
might
pray
together
struggle
together
together
wear
their
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
together
console
themselves
with
their
hopes
of
eternal
joys
while
they
shuddered
not
altogether
uncomfortably
at
the
torments
prepared
for
others
this
was
now
the
only
outlook
in
which
she
could
find
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
and
she
was
so
assured
of
the
reasonableness
of
her
wishes
so
convinced
that
the
house
of
her
parents
was
now
the
only
house
in
which
hester
could
live
without
running
counter
to
the
precepts
of
her
own
religion
and
counter
also
to
the
rules
of
the
wicked
outside
world
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
but
that
she
would
succeed
at
last
merely
to
ask
her
child
to
come
to
repeat
the
invitation
and
then
to
take
a
refusal
was
by
no
means
sufficient
for
her
energy
she
had
failed
grievously
when
she
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
daughter
a
prisoner
at
the
grange
after
such
an
attempt
as
that
it
could
hardly
be
thought
that
ordinary
invitations
would
be
efficacious
but
when
that
attempt
had
been
made
it
was
possible
that
hester
should
justify
herself
by
the
law
according
to
law
she
had
then
been
caldigate
wife
there
had
been
some
ground
for
her
to
stand
upon
as
a
wife
and
as
a
wife
she
had
stood
upon
it
very
firmly
but
now
there
was
not
an
inch
of
ground
the
man
had
been
convicted
as
a
bigamist
and
the
other
woman
the
first
woman
had
been
proved
to
be
his
wife
bolton
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
the
two
had
been
dissevered
as
though
by
some
supernal
power
and
no
explanation
to
the
contrary
brought
to
her
by
her
husband
from
robert
had
any
power
of
shaking
her
conviction
it
was
manifest
to
all
men
and
to
all
women
that
she
who
had
been
seduced
betrayed
and
sacrificed
should
now
return
with
her
innocent
babe
to
the
protection
of
her
roof
and
no
stone
must
be
left
unturned
till
the
unfortunate
one
had
been
made
to
understand
her
duty
the
old
banker
in
these
days
had
not
a
good
time
nor
indeed
had
the
boltons
generally
bolton
though
prone
to
grasp
at
power
on
every
side
was
apt
like
some
other
women
who
are
equally
grasping
to
expect
almost
omnipotence
from
the
men
around
her
when
she
was
desirous
that
something
should
be
done
by
them
in
accordance
with
her
own
bidding
knowing
her
husband
to
be
weak
from
age
and
sorrow
she
could
still
jeer
at
him
because
he
was
not
abnormally
strong
and
though
her
intercourse
with
his
sons
and
their
families
was
now
scanty
and
infrequent
still
by
a
word
here
and
a
line
there
she
could
make
her
reproaches
felt
by
them
all
robert
who
saw
his
father
every
day
heard
very
much
of
them
daniel
was
often
stung
and
even
nicholas
and
the
reproaches
reached
as
far
as
william
the
barrister
up
in
london
am
sure
i
do
know
what
we
can
do
said
the
miserable
father
sitting
huddled
up
in
his
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
august
it
was
very
hot
but
the
windows
were
closed
because
he
could
not
bear
a
draught
and
he
was
somewhat
impatiently
waiting
for
the
hour
of
prayers
which
were
antecedent
to
bed
where
he
could
be
silent
even
if
he
could
not
sleep
are
five
of
you
one
should
be
at
the
house
every
day
to
tell
her
of
her
duty
could
go
could
go
if
they
cared
if
they
cared
they
would
go
they
are
her
brothers
caldigate
would
not
let
them
enter
the
house
said
the
old
man
you
mean
that
he
would
separate
her
from
her
brother
and
her
parents
if
she
wished
to
see
them
she
is
her
own
mistress
and
he
will
abet
her
in
whatever
she
may
choose
to
do
that
is
what
robert
says
what
robert
says
is
to
be
law
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
bolton
as
he
said
this
shook
his
head
angrily
because
he
was
fatigued
he
is
to
be
your
guide
even
when
your
daughter
soul
is
in
jeopardy
this
was
the
line
of
argument
in
reference
to
which
bolton
always
felt
himself
to
be
as
weak
as
water
before
his
wife
he
did
not
dare
to
rebel
against
her
religious
supremacy
not
simply
because
he
was
a
weak
old
man
in
presence
of
a
strong
woman
but
from
fear
of
denunciation
he
too
believed
her
creed
though
he
was
made
miserable
by
her
constant
adherence
to
it
he
believed
and
would
fain
have
let
that
suffice
she
believed
and
endeavoured
to
live
up
to
her
belief
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
she
spoke
to
him
of
his
own
soul
of
the
souls
of
those
who
were
dear
to
him
or
even
of
souls
in
general
he
was
frightened
and
paralysed
he
had
more
than
once
attempted
to
reply
with
worldly
arguments
but
had
suffered
so
much
in
the
encounter
that
he
had
learned
to
abstain
can
not
believe
that
she
would
refuse
to
see
us
i
shall
go
myself
but
if
we
all
went
we
should
surely
persuade
her
in
answer
to
this
the
poor
man
only
groaned
till
the
coming
in
of
the
old
servant
to
arrange
the
chairs
and
put
the
big
bible
on
the
table
relieved
him
from
something
of
his
misery
certainly
will
not
interfere
robert
bolton
said
to
his
father
on
the
next
morning
will
not
go
to
folking
because
i
am
sure
that
i
should
do
no
good
hester
no
doubt
would
be
better
at
your
house
much
better
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
get
her
back
from
the
caldigates
altogether
if
there
was
a
chance
of
success
but
we
have
no
power
none
whatever
power
at
all
said
the
banker
shaking
his
head
and
feeling
some
satisfaction
at
the
possession
of
an
intelligible
word
which
he
could
quote
to
his
wife
is
controller
of
her
own
actions
as
completely
as
are
you
and
i
we
have
already
seen
how
inefficacious
with
her
are
all
attempts
at
persuasion
and
she
knows
her
position
if
he
were
out
of
prison
he
would
be
her
husband
he
has
another
wife
that
the
civil
law
knows
nothing
if
money
were
coming
to
her
he
could
claim
it
and
the
verdict
against
him
would
only
be
evidence
to
be
taken
for
what
it
was
worth
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
had
she
wished
to
sever
herself
from
him
but
as
she
is
determined
not
to
do
so
any
interference
would
be
useless
the
question
as
to
the
marriage
or
no
marriage
was
not
made
quite
clear
to
the
banker
mind
but
he
did
understand
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
nor
his
sons
had
power
and
of
that
argument
he
was
determined
to
make
use
william
the
barrister
in
london
was
induced
to
write
a
letter
a
very
lengthy
and
elaborate
epistle
having
come
from
bolton
to
his
wife
in
which
the
religious
duty
of
all
the
boltons
was
set
forth
in
strong
language
and
in
which
he
was
incited
to
do
something
it
was
almost
the
first
letter
which
william
bolton
had
ever
received
from
her
whatever
trifling
correspondence
there
might
have
been
between
them
having
been
of
no
consequence
they
too
felt
that
it
would
be
better
that
hester
should
return
to
her
old
home
but
felt
also
that
they
had
no
power
course
she
wo
said
william
has
a
will
of
her
own
said
the
barrister
should
she
think
of
the
gloom
of
that
home
at
chesterton
and
her
absolute
independence
at
folking
no
doubt
it
would
be
better
the
position
is
so
frightful
that
even
the
gloom
would
be
better
but
she
wo
we
all
know
that
the
barrister
however
feeling
that
it
would
be
better
thought
that
he
should
perform
his
duty
by
expressing
his
opinion
and
wrote
a
letter
to
hester
which
was
intended
to
be
if
possible
persuasive
and
this
was
the
answer
william
if
you
were
carried
away
to
prison
on
some
horrible
false
accusation
would
fanny
go
away
from
you
and
desert
your
house
and
your
affairs
and
return
to
her
parents
you
ask
her
and
ask
her
whether
she
would
believe
anything
that
anybody
could
say
against
you
if
they
told
her
that
her
children
were
nameless
would
she
agree
to
make
them
so
by
giving
up
your
name
would
she
cling
to
you
the
more
the
more
all
the
world
was
against
you
would
said
fanny
with
tearful
energy
was
of
course
william
bolton
and
was
the
happy
mother
of
five
nearly
sons
and
daughters
and
certainly
stood
in
no
peril
as
to
her
own
or
their
possession
of
the
name
of
bolton
the
letter
was
being
read
aloud
to
her
by
her
husband
whose
mind
was
also
stirred
in
his
sister
favour
by
the
nature
of
the
arguments
used
so
continued
the
writer
should
i
be
the
same
i
believe
a
word
the
people
said
i
am
sure
i
am
his
wife
and
as
when
he
was
taken
away
from
me
he
left
a
house
for
his
wife
and
child
to
live
in
i
shall
continue
to
live
in
it
the
same
i
know
you
mean
to
be
good
to
me
give
my
best
love
to
fanny
and
believe
me
your
affectionate
sister
caldigate
in
every
letter
and
stroke
of
the
name
as
she
wrote
it
there
was
an
assertion
that
she
claimed
it
as
her
own
and
that
she
was
not
ashamed
of
it
my
word
said
william
bolton
through
her
tears
am
beginning
to
think
that
she
is
almost
right
there
was
so
much
of
conjugal
proper
feeling
in
this
that
the
husband
could
only
kiss
his
wife
and
leave
her
without
further
argument
on
the
matter
chapter
xlvi
burning
words
power
at
all
none
whatever
the
banker
said
when
he
was
next
compelled
to
carry
on
the
conversation
this
was
immediately
upon
his
return
home
from
cambridge
for
his
wife
never
allowed
the
subject
to
be
forgotten
or
set
aside
every
afternoon
and
every
evening
it
was
being
discussed
at
all
hours
not
devoted
to
prayers
and
every
morning
it
was
renewed
at
the
comes
from
robert
bolton
was
not
able
to
deny
the
assertion
does
he
mean
by
no
power
ca
make
her
do
it
the
magistrates
ca
interfere
has
it
been
by
the
interference
of
magistrates
that
men
have
succeeded
in
doing
great
things
was
it
by
order
from
the
magistrates
that
the
lessons
of
christ
have
been
taught
over
all
the
world
is
there
no
such
thing
as
persuasion
has
truth
no
power
is
she
more
deaf
to
argument
and
eloquence
than
another
is
very
deaf
i
think
said
the
father
doubting
his
own
eloquence
is
because
no
one
has
endeavoured
to
awaken
her
by
burning
words
to
a
true
sense
of
her
situation
when
she
said
this
she
must
surely
have
forgotten
much
that
had
occurred
during
those
weary
hours
which
had
been
passed
by
her
and
her
daughter
outside
there
in
the
hall
power
she
repeated
is
the
answer
always
made
by
those
who
are
too
sleepy
to
do
the
lord
work
it
was
because
men
said
that
they
had
no
power
that
the
grain
fell
upon
stony
places
where
they
had
not
much
earth
it
is
that
aversion
to
face
difficulties
which
causes
the
broad
path
to
be
crowded
with
victims
i
at
any
rate
will
go
i
may
have
no
power
but
i
will
make
the
attempt
soon
after
that
she
did
make
the
attempt
bolton
though
he
was
assured
by
robert
that
such
an
attempt
would
produce
no
result
could
not
interfere
to
prevent
it
had
he
been
far
stronger
than
he
was
in
his
own
house
he
could
hardly
have
forbidden
the
mother
to
visit
the
daughter
hester
had
sent
word
to
say
that
she
did
not
wish
to
see
even
her
mother
but
this
had
been
immediately
after
the
verdict
when
she
was
crushed
and
almost
annihilated
by
her
misery
some
weeks
had
now
passed
by
and
it
could
not
be
that
she
would
refuse
to
admit
the
visitor
when
such
a
visitor
knocked
at
her
door
they
had
loved
each
other
as
mothers
and
daughters
do
love
when
there
is
no
rival
in
the
affection
when
each
has
no
one
else
to
love
there
never
had
been
a
more
obedient
child
or
a
more
loving
parent
much
no
doubt
had
happened
since
to
estrange
the
daughter
from
the
mother
a
husband
had
been
given
to
her
who
was
more
to
her
than
any
parent
as
a
husband
should
be
and
then
there
had
been
that
terrible
opposition
that
struggle
that
battle
in
the
hall
but
the
mother
love
had
never
waned
because
of
that
she
was
sure
that
her
child
would
not
refuse
to
see
her
so
the
fly
was
ordered
to
take
her
out
to
folking
and
on
the
morning
fixed
she
dressed
herself
in
her
blackest
black
she
always
wore
brown
or
black
brown
being
the
colour
suitable
for
the
sober
and
sad
domesticities
of
her
which
on
ceremonies
and
sabbath
was
changed
for
a
more
solemn
black
but
in
her
wardrobe
there
were
two
such
gowns
one
of
which
was
apparently
blacker
than
the
other
nearer
to
a
guise
of
widowhood
more
fit
at
any
rate
for
general
funereal
obsequies
there
are
women
who
seem
always
to
be
burying
someone
and
bolton
as
she
went
forth
to
visit
her
daughter
was
fit
to
bury
any
one
short
of
her
husband
it
was
a
hot
day
in
august
and
the
fly
travelled
along
the
dusty
road
very
slowly
she
had
intended
to
reach
folking
at
twelve
so
that
her
interview
might
be
over
and
that
she
might
return
without
the
need
of
eating
there
is
always
some
idea
of
festivity
connected
with
food
eaten
at
a
friend
table
and
she
did
not
wish
to
be
festive
she
was
too
most
unwilling
to
partake
of
john
caldigate
bread
but
she
did
not
reach
the
house
till
one
and
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
modest
lunch
was
about
to
be
put
upon
the
table
there
was
considerable
confusion
when
the
servant
saw
bolton
standing
in
the
doorway
it
was
quite
understood
by
everyone
at
folking
that
for
the
present
there
was
to
be
no
intercourse
between
the
boltons
and
the
caldigates
it
was
understood
that
there
should
be
no
visitors
of
any
kind
at
folking
and
it
had
been
thought
that
smirkie
had
forced
an
entrance
in
an
impertinent
manner
but
yet
it
was
not
possible
to
send
bolton
from
her
own
daughter
door
with
a
mere
at
home
of
course
she
was
shown
in
and
was
taken
to
the
parlour
in
which
the
lunch
was
prepared
while
word
was
taken
up
to
hester
announcing
that
her
mother
was
there
caldigate
was
in
the
house
in
his
own
as
it
used
to
be
called
and
hester
went
to
him
first
is
here
in
the
mother
long
to
see
mamma
course
you
do
she
will
want
me
to
go
away
with
her
can
not
take
you
unless
you
choose
to
go
she
will
speak
of
nothing
else
i
know
it
i
wish
she
had
not
come
hester
you
can
make
her
understand
that
your
mind
is
made
up
i
shall
do
that
i
must
do
that
but
father
it
will
be
very
painful
you
do
not
know
what
things
she
can
say
it
nearly
killed
me
when
i
was
at
the
grange
you
will
not
see
her
i
suppose
you
wish
it
i
will
she
will
not
care
to
see
me
and
as
things
are
at
present
what
room
is
there
for
friendship
will
come
if
i
send
for
you
if
you
send
for
me
i
will
come
at
once
then
she
crept
slowly
out
of
the
room
and
very
slowly
and
very
silently
made
her
way
to
the
though
she
was
of
a
strong
nature
unusually
strong
of
heart
and
fixed
of
purpose
now
her
heart
misgave
her
that
terrible
struggle
with
all
its
incidents
of
weariness
and
agony
was
present
to
her
mind
her
mother
could
not
turn
the
lock
on
her
now
but
as
she
had
said
it
would
be
very
dreadful
her
mother
would
say
words
to
her
which
would
go
through
her
like
swords
then
she
opened
the
door
and
for
a
moment
there
was
the
sweetness
of
an
embrace
there
was
a
prolonged
tenderness
in
the
kiss
which
even
to
bolton
had
a
charm
for
the
moment
to
soften
her
spirit
mamma
my
own
mamma
child
mamma
every
day
when
i
pray
for
you
i
tell
myself
that
i
am
still
your
child
i
do
only
one
my
only
one
all
that
i
have
then
again
they
were
in
each
other
arms
yet
when
they
had
last
met
one
had
been
the
jailer
and
the
other
the
prisoner
and
they
had
fought
it
out
between
them
with
a
determined
obstinacy
which
at
moments
had
almost
amounted
to
hatred
but
now
the
very
memory
of
these
sad
hours
increased
their
tenderness
through
it
all
do
you
not
know
that
my
heart
yearns
for
you
day
and
night
that
in
my
prayers
i
am
always
remembering
you
that
my
dreams
are
happy
because
you
are
with
me
that
i
am
ever
longing
for
you
as
ruth
longed
for
naomi
i
am
as
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
who
would
not
be
comforted
because
they
are
not
day
and
night
my
are
torn
asunder
because
my
eyes
behold
you
not
it
was
true
and
the
daughter
knew
it
to
be
true
but
what
could
be
done
there
had
grown
up
something
for
her
holier
greater
more
absorbing
even
than
a
mother
love
happily
for
most
young
wives
though
the
new
tie
may
surmount
the
old
one
it
does
not
crush
it
or
smother
it
the
mother
retains
a
diminished
hold
and
knowing
what
nature
has
intended
is
content
she
too
with
some
subsidiary
worship
kneels
at
the
new
altar
and
all
is
well
but
here
though
there
was
abundant
love
there
was
no
sympathy
the
cause
of
discord
was
ever
present
to
them
both
unless
john
caldigate
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
fitting
husband
not
even
the
mother
could
be
received
with
a
full
welcome
and
unless
john
caldigate
were
repudiated
not
even
the
daughter
could
be
accepted
as
altogether
pure
parental
and
filial
feelings
sufficed
for
nothing
between
them
beyond
the
ecstasy
of
a
caress
as
hester
was
standing
mute
still
holding
her
mother
hand
the
servant
came
to
the
door
and
asked
whether
she
would
have
her
lunch
will
stay
and
eat
with
me
mamma
but
you
will
come
up
to
my
room
first
will
go
up
to
your
room
hester
we
will
have
our
lunch
hester
said
turning
to
the
servant
so
the
two
went
together
to
the
upper
chamber
and
in
a
moment
the
mother
had
fetched
her
baby
and
placed
it
in
her
mother
arms
wish
he
were
at
the
grange
said
bolton
then
hester
shook
her
head
but
feeling
the
security
of
her
position
left
the
baby
with
its
grandmother
wish
he
were
at
the
grange
it
is
the
only
fitting
home
for
him
at
present
mamma
that
can
not
be
should
be
so
hester
it
should
be
so
do
not
speak
of
it
dear
mamma
i
not
come
here
on
purpose
that
i
might
speak
of
it
sweet
as
it
is
to
me
to
have
you
in
my
arms
do
you
not
know
that
i
have
come
for
that
purpose
for
that
only
can
not
be
so
will
not
take
such
an
answer
hester
i
am
not
here
to
speak
of
pleasure
or
delights
not
to
speak
of
sweet
companionship
or
even
of
a
return
to
that
more
godly
life
which
i
think
you
would
find
in
your
father
house
had
not
this
ruin
come
unhappy
though
i
might
have
been
and
distrustful
i
should
not
have
interfered
those
whom
god
has
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
is
what
i
say
to
myself
every
hour
god
has
joined
us
and
no
man
no
number
of
men
shall
put
us
asunder
my
own
darling
god
has
not
joined
you
when
he
pretended
to
be
joined
to
you
he
had
a
wife
then
living
still
living
you
set
up
your
own
opinion
against
evidence
which
the
jury
has
believed
which
the
judge
has
believed
which
all
the
world
has
believed
i
will
said
hester
the
whole
nature
of
whose
face
was
now
altered
and
who
looked
as
she
did
when
sitting
in
the
at
puritan
grange
will
though
i
were
almost
to
know
that
he
had
been
false
i
should
still
believe
him
to
be
true
can
not
understand
that
hester
i
know
him
to
be
true
quite
true
she
said
wishing
to
erase
the
feeling
which
her
unguarded
admission
had
made
to
believe
him
to
have
been
true
would
be
death
to
me
and
for
my
boy
sake
i
would
wish
to
live
but
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
will
listen
to
no
one
not
even
to
you
when
you
tell
me
that
god
did
not
join
us
together
can
not
go
behind
the
law
hester
as
a
citizen
you
must
obey
the
law
will
live
here
as
a
citizen
till
he
has
been
restored
to
me
he
will
not
then
be
your
husband
people
will
not
call
you
by
his
name
he
can
not
have
two
wives
she
will
be
his
wife
oh
hester
have
you
thought
of
it
have
thought
of
it
she
said
raising
her
face
looking
upwards
through
the
open
window
out
away
towards
the
heavens
and
pressing
her
foot
firmly
upon
the
floor
have
thought
of
it
very
much
and
i
have
asked
the
lord
for
counsel
and
he
has
given
it
me
he
has
told
me
what
to
believe
what
to
know
and
how
to
live
i
will
never
again
lie
with
my
head
upon
his
bosom
unless
all
that
be
altered
but
i
will
serve
him
as
his
wife
and
obey
him
and
if
i
can
i
will
comfort
him
i
will
never
desert
him
and
not
all
the
laws
that
were
ever
made
nor
all
the
judges
that
ever
sat
in
judgment
shall
make
me
call
myself
by
another
name
than
his
the
mother
had
come
there
to
speak
burning
words
and
she
had
in
some
sort
prepared
them
but
now
she
found
herself
almost
silenced
by
the
energy
of
her
daughter
and
when
her
girl
told
her
that
she
had
applied
to
her
god
for
counsel
and
that
the
lord
had
answered
her
prayers
that
the
lord
had
directed
her
as
to
her
future
life
then
the
mother
hardly
knew
how
to
mount
to
higher
ground
so
as
to
seem
to
speak
from
a
more
exalted
eminence
and
yet
she
was
not
at
all
convinced
that
the
lord
should
give
bad
counsel
she
knew
to
be
impossible
that
the
lord
would
certainly
give
good
counsel
to
such
a
suppliant
if
asked
aright
she
was
quite
sure
but
they
who
send
others
to
the
throne
of
heaven
for
direct
advice
are
apt
to
think
that
the
asking
will
not
be
done
aright
unless
it
be
done
with
their
spirit
and
their
bias
with
the
spirit
and
bias
which
they
feel
when
they
recommend
the
operation
no
one
has
ever
thought
that
direct
advice
from
the
lord
was
sufficient
authority
for
the
doing
of
that
of
which
he
himself
disapproved
it
was
daily
custom
to
kneel
herself
and
ask
for
such
counsel
and
to
enjoin
such
asking
upon
all
those
who
were
subject
to
her
influence
but
had
she
been
assured
by
some
young
lady
to
whom
she
had
recommended
the
practice
that
heavenly
warrant
had
thus
been
secured
for
balls
and
theatres
she
would
not
have
scrupled
to
declare
that
the
lord
had
certainly
not
been
asked
aright
she
was
equally
certain
of
some
defalcation
now
she
did
not
doubt
that
hester
had
done
as
she
had
said
that
the
prayer
had
been
put
up
with
energetic
fervour
she
was
sure
but
energetic
fervour
in
prayer
was
she
thought
of
no
use
nay
was
likely
to
be
most
dangerous
when
used
in
furtherance
of
human
prepossessions
and
desires
had
hester
said
her
prayers
with
a
proper
feeling
of
in
that
religious
spirit
which
teaches
the
poor
mortal
here
on
earth
to
know
that
darkness
and
gloom
are
safer
than
mirth
and
comfort
then
the
lord
would
have
told
her
to
leave
folking
to
go
back
to
puritan
grange
and
to
consent
once
more
to
be
called
hester
bolton
this
other
counsel
had
not
come
from
the
lord
had
come
only
from
hester
own
polluted
heart
but
she
was
not
at
the
moment
armed
with
words
sufficiently
strong
to
explain
all
this
she
said
not
all
this
mean
that
your
own
proud
spirit
is
to
have
a
stronger
dominion
over
you
than
the
experience
and
wisdom
of
all
your
friends
it
does
but
at
any
rate
my
proud
spirit
will
retain
its
pride
will
be
obstinate
i
will
nothing
on
earth
shall
make
me
leave
this
house
till
i
am
told
by
its
owner
to
go
is
its
owner
old
caldigate
is
its
owner
hardly
know
though
john
has
explained
it
again
and
again
i
am
so
bad
at
such
things
that
i
am
not
sure
but
i
can
do
what
i
please
with
it
i
am
the
mistress
here
as
you
say
that
the
grange
is
your
house
i
can
say
that
this
is
mine
it
is
the
abode
appointed
for
me
and
here
i
will
abide
hester
i
can
only
tell
you
that
you
are
sinning
it
is
a
heavy
grievous
and
most
obvious
sin
mother
dear
mamma
i
knew
how
it
would
be
if
you
came
it
is
useless
for
me
to
say
more
were
i
to
go
away
that
to
me
would
be
the
sin
why
should
we
discuss
it
any
more
there
comes
a
time
to
all
of
us
when
we
must
act
on
our
own
responsibility
my
husband
is
in
prison
and
can
not
personally
direct
me
no
doubt
i
could
go
were
i
so
pleased
his
father
would
not
hinder
me
though
he
is
most
unwilling
that
i
should
go
i
must
judge
a
little
for
myself
but
i
have
his
judgment
to
fall
back
upon
he
told
me
to
stay
and
i
shall
stay
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
bolton
was
thinking
of
her
burning
words
was
remembering
the
scorn
with
which
she
had
treated
her
husband
when
he
told
her
that
they
had
power
she
had
endeavoured
herself
not
to
be
sleepy
in
doing
the
lord
work
but
her
seed
too
had
fallen
upon
stony
places
she
was
powerless
to
do
or
even
to
say
anything
further
i
may
go
she
muttered
will
come
and
eat
with
me
mamma
my
dear
no
do
not
wish
that
there
should
be
a
quarrel
is
very
much
hester
that
i
do
not
wish
i
have
long
ceased
to
trust
much
to
any
wishes
there
is
a
great
gulf
between
us
and
i
will
not
attempt
to
bridge
it
by
the
hollow
pretence
of
sitting
at
table
with
you
i
will
still
pray
that
you
may
be
restored
to
me
then
she
went
to
the
door
you
will
kiss
me
before
you
go
will
cover
you
with
kisses
when
you
return
to
your
own
home
but
in
spite
of
this
hester
went
down
with
her
into
the
hall
holding
by
her
raiment
and
as
bolton
got
into
the
fly
she
did
succeed
in
kissing
her
mother
hand
has
gone
said
hester
going
to
her
room
i
was
so
glad
to
see
her
i
wish
she
had
not
come
when
people
think
so
very
very
differently
on
a
matter
which
is
so
very
very
important
it
is
better
that
they
should
not
meet
let
them
love
each
other
ever
so
as
far
as
hester
and
caldigate
were
concerned
the
visit
had
in
truth
been
made
without
much
inconvenience
there
had
been
no
absolute
violence
no
repetition
of
such
outward
quarrelling
as
had
made
those
two
days
at
the
grange
so
memorable
there
was
almost
a
feeling
of
relief
in
hester
bosom
when
her
mother
was
driven
away
after
that
successful
grasp
at
the
parting
hand
though
they
had
differed
much
they
had
not
hated
each
other
during
that
last
hester
had
been
charged
with
sin
which
however
had
been
a
matter
of
course
but
in
bolton
heart
there
was
a
feeling
which
made
her
return
home
very
uncomfortable
having
twitted
her
husband
with
his
lack
of
power
she
had
been
altogether
powerless
herself
and
now
she
was
driven
to
confess
to
herself
that
no
further
step
could
be
taken
is
obstinate
she
said
to
her
husband
in
her
sin
as
are
all
determined
sinners
i
can
say
no
more
to
her
it
may
be
that
the
lord
will
soften
her
heart
when
her
sorrows
have
endured
yet
for
a
time
but
she
said
no
more
of
burning
words
or
of
eloquence
or
of
the
slackness
of
the
work
of
those
who
work
as
though
they
were
not
in
earnest

and
bagwax
there
had
been
a
sort
of
pledge
given
at
the
trial
by
sir
john
joram
that
the
matter
of
the
envelope
should
be
further
investigated
he
had
complained
in
his
defence
that
the
trial
had
been
hurried
on
that
time
had
not
been
allowed
for
full
inquiries
seeing
that
the
character
of
the
deed
by
which
his
client
had
been
put
in
jeopardy
depended
upon
what
had
been
done
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
crime
he
had
said
it
be
a
crime
was
no
doubt
committed
in
the
parish
church
of
utterden
in
the
early
part
of
last
year
but
all
the
evidence
which
has
been
used
or
which
could
be
used
to
prove
it
to
have
been
a
crime
has
reference
to
things
done
long
ago
and
far
away
time
has
not
been
allowed
us
for
rebutting
this
evidence
by
and
yet
much
time
had
been
allowed
the
trial
had
been
postponed
from
the
spring
to
the
summer
assizes
and
then
the
offence
was
one
which
from
its
very
nature
required
speedy
notice
the
boltons
who
became
the
instigators
of
the
prosecution
demanded
that
the
woman
should
be
relieved
as
quickly
as
possible
from
her
degradation
there
had
been
a
general
feeling
that
the
trial
should
not
be
thrown
over
to
another
year
and
as
we
are
aware
it
had
been
brought
to
judgment
and
the
convicted
criminal
was
in
jail
but
sir
john
still
persevered
and
to
this
perseverance
he
had
been
instigated
very
much
by
a
certain
clerk
in
the
two
clerks
had
been
used
as
witnesses
at
the
trial
of
whom
the
elder
curlydown
had
been
by
no
means
a
constant
or
an
energetic
witness
a
witness
when
he
is
brought
up
for
the
defence
should
not
be
too
scrupulous
or
he
will
be
worse
than
useless
in
a
matter
of
fact
a
man
can
only
say
what
he
saw
or
tell
what
he
heard
or
declare
what
he
knew
he
should
at
least
do
no
more
though
it
be
to
save
his
father
he
should
not
commit
perjury
but
when
it
comes
to
opinion
if
a
man
allows
himself
to
waver
he
will
be
taken
as
thinking
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
does
think
such
had
been
the
case
with
curlydown
he
had
intended
to
be
very
correct
he
had
believed
that
the
impression
of
the
sydney
stamp
was
on
the
whole
adverse
to
the
idea
that
it
had
been
obtained
in
the
proper
way
and
yet
he
had
when
acknowledged
that
it
might
very
probably
have
been
obtained
in
the
proper
way
it
certainly
had
not
been
at
all
and
such
impressions
generally
did
become
but
then
he
was
made
to
say
also
that
impressions
very
often
did
not
become
smudged
and
as
to
the
word
which
should
have
been
stamped
upon
the
envelope
he
thought
that
in
such
a
case
its
absence
was
very
suspicious
but
still
he
was
brought
to
acknowledge
that
in
provincial
offices
far
away
from
inspection
frequently
omit
that
part
of
their
duty
all
this
had
tended
to
rob
the
envelope
of
those
attributes
of
deceit
and
conspiracy
which
sir
john
joram
attributed
to
it
and
had
justified
the
judge
in
his
opinion
that
evidence
had
told
them
little
or
nothing
but
even
curlydown
had
found
more
favour
with
the
judge
than
samuel
bagwax
the
junior
of
the
two
witnesses
samuel
bagwax
had
perhaps
been
a
little
too
energetic
he
had
made
the
case
his
own
and
was
quite
sure
that
the
envelope
had
been
tampered
with
i
think
that
the
counsel
for
the
crown
pressed
his
witness
unfairly
when
he
asked
bagwax
whether
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
an
envelope
with
such
an
impression
could
not
have
passed
through
the
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
is
impossible
bagwax
had
replied
it
not
very
much
within
the
sphere
of
possibility
the
learned
gentleman
had
asked
the
phrase
was
misleading
and
bagwax
was
induced
to
say
that
it
might
be
so
but
still
his
assurance
would
probably
have
had
weight
with
the
jury
but
for
the
overstrained
honesty
of
his
companion
the
judge
had
admonished
the
jury
that
in
reference
to
such
a
point
they
should
use
their
own
rather
than
the
opinion
of
such
a
man
as
bagwax
a
man
of
ordinary
would
know
how
the
mark
made
by
a
die
on
a
letter
would
be
affected
by
the
sort
of
manipulation
to
which
the
letter
bearing
it
would
be
subjected
and
so
on
from
all
which
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judge
was
understood
to
have
declared
that
that
special
envelope
might
very
well
have
passed
in
ordinary
course
through
the
sydney
but
samuel
bagwax
was
not
a
man
to
be
put
down
by
the
injustice
of
lawyers
he
knew
himself
to
have
been
he
was
confident
that
no
man
alive
was
more
competent
than
himself
to
form
an
opinion
on
such
a
subject
and
he
was
sure
quite
sure
perhaps
a
little
too
sure
that
there
had
been
some
dishonesty
with
that
envelope
and
thus
he
became
a
strong
partisan
of
john
caldigate
and
of
john
caldigate
if
there
had
been
tampering
with
that
envelope
then
the
whole
thing
was
fraudulent
false
and
the
outcome
of
a
base
conspiracy
many
points
were
present
to
his
mind
which
the
lawyers
between
them
would
not
allow
him
to
explain
properly
to
a
jury
when
had
that
die
been
cut
by
which
so
perfect
an
impression
had
been
formed
if
it
could
be
proved
that
it
had
been
cut
since
the
date
it
bore
then
of
course
the
envelope
would
be
fraudulent
but
it
was
only
in
sydney
that
this
could
be
ascertained
he
was
sure
that
a
week
ordinary
use
would
have
made
the
impression
less
perfect
some
letters
must
of
course
be
subjected
to
new
dies
and
this
letter
might
in
due
course
have
been
so
subjected
but
it
was
more
probable
that
a
new
stamp
should
have
been
selected
for
a
surreptitious
purpose
all
this
could
be
ascertained
by
the
book
of
daily
impressions
kept
in
the
sydney
but
there
had
not
been
time
to
get
this
evidence
from
sydney
since
this
question
of
the
impression
had
been
ventilated
it
was
he
who
had
first
given
importance
to
the
envelope
and
being
a
resolute
and
almost
heroic
man
he
was
determined
that
no
injustice
on
the
part
of
a
crown
prosecutor
no
darkness
in
a
judge
mind
no
want
of
intelligence
in
a
jury
should
rob
him
of
the
delight
of
showing
how
important
to
the
world
was
a
proper
understanding
of
details
he
still
thought
that
that
envelope
might
be
made
to
prove
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
crinkett
and
the
others
and
he
succeeded
in
getting
sir
john
joram
to
share
that
belief
the
envelope
itself
was
still
preserved
among
the
sacred
archives
of
the
trial
that
had
not
been
bodily
confided
to
samuel
bagwax
but
various
photographs
had
been
made
of
the
document
which
no
doubt
reproduced
exactly
every
letter
every
mark
and
every
line
which
was
to
be
seen
upon
it
by
the
closest
inspection
there
was
the
direction
which
was
admitted
to
be
in
caldigate
handwriting
the
with
its
obliterating
lines
and
the
impression
of
the
sydney
postmark
that
was
nearly
all
the
paper
of
the
envelope
had
no
bagwax
thought
that
if
he
could
get
hold
of
the
envelope
itself
something
might
be
done
even
with
that
but
here
sir
john
could
not
go
along
with
him
as
it
had
been
fully
acknowledged
that
the
envelope
had
passed
from
the
possession
of
caldigate
into
the
hands
of
the
woman
bearing
the
written
address
if
anything
could
be
done
it
must
be
done
by
the
postmarks
and
those
postmarks
bagwax
studied
morning
noon
and
night
it
had
now
been
decided
that
bagwax
was
to
be
sent
out
to
sydney
at
the
expense
of
the
caldigates
there
had
been
difficulty
as
to
leave
of
absence
for
such
a
purpose
the
man
having
been
convicted
the
was
bound
to
regard
him
as
guilty
and
hesitated
to
allow
a
clerk
to
be
absent
so
long
on
behalf
of
a
man
who
was
already
in
prison
but
the
secretary
of
state
overruled
this
scruple
and
the
leave
was
to
be
given
bagwax
was
elate
first
and
chiefly
because
he
trusted
that
he
would
become
the
means
of
putting
right
a
foul
and
cruel
wrong
for
in
these
days
bagwax
almost
wept
over
the
hardships
inflicted
on
that
poor
lady
at
folking
but
he
was
elated
also
by
the
prospect
of
his
travels
and
by
the
godsend
of
a
six
months
leave
of
absence
he
was
a
little
proud
too
at
having
had
this
personal
attention
paid
to
him
by
the
secretary
of
state
all
this
was
very
gratifying
but
that
which
gratified
him
was
not
so
charming
to
his
brother
clerks
they
had
never
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
leaving
that
weary
office
for
six
months
they
were
not
allowed
to
occupy
themselves
in
contemplating
an
envelope
they
were
never
specially
mentioned
by
the
secretary
of
state
of
course
there
was
a
little
envy
and
a
somewhat
general
feeling
that
bagwax
having
got
to
the
weak
side
of
sir
john
joram
was
succeeding
in
having
himself
sent
out
as
a
overland
passenger
to
sydney
merely
as
a
job
paris
to
be
seen
and
the
tunnel
and
the
railways
through
italy
and
the
suez
canal
all
these
places
not
delightful
to
the
wives
of
indian
officers
coming
home
or
going
out
were
an
elysium
to
the
mind
his
expenses
to
be
paid
for
six
months
on
the
most
footing
and
his
salary
going
on
all
the
time
official
human
nature
good
as
it
generally
is
can
not
learn
that
such
glories
are
to
be
showered
on
one
not
specially
deserving
head
without
something
akin
to
enmity
the
general
idea
therefore
in
the
office
was
that
bagwax
would
do
no
good
in
sydney
that
others
would
have
been
better
than
bagwax
in
fact
that
of
all
the
clerks
in
all
the
departments
bagwax
was
the
very
last
man
who
ought
to
have
been
selected
for
an
enterprise
demanding
secrecy
discretion
and
some
judicial
severity
curlydown
and
bagwax
occupied
the
same
room
at
the
office
in
and
there
it
was
their
fate
in
life
to
arrange
inspect
and
generally
attend
to
those
apparently
unintelligible
hieroglyphics
with
which
the
outside
coverings
of
our
correspondence
are
generally
bedaubed
curlydown
hair
had
fallen
from
his
head
and
his
face
had
become
puckered
with
wrinkles
through
anxiety
to
make
these
markings
legible
and
intelligible
the
popular
newspaper
the
popular
member
of
parliament
and
the
popular
novelist
the
name
of
charles
dickens
will
of
course
present
itself
to
the
reader
who
remembers
the
circumlocution
office
have
had
it
impressed
on
their
several
minds
and
have
endeavoured
to
impress
the
same
idea
on
the
minds
of
the
public
generally
that
the
normal
government
clerk
is
quite
indifferent
to
his
work
no
greater
mistake
was
ever
made
or
one
showing
less
observation
of
human
nature
it
is
the
nature
of
a
man
to
appreciate
his
own
work
the
felon
who
is
made
simply
to
move
shot
perishes
because
he
knows
his
work
is
without
aim
the
fault
lies
on
the
other
side
the
policeman
is
ambitious
of
arresting
everybody
the
lawyer
would
rather
make
your
will
for
you
gratis
than
let
you
make
your
own
the
general
can
believe
in
nothing
but
in
troops
curlydown
would
willingly
have
expended
the
whole
net
revenue
of
the
and
his
own
in
improving
the
machinery
for
stamping
letters
but
he
had
hardly
succeeded
in
life
he
had
done
his
duty
and
was
respected
by
all
he
lived
comfortably
in
a
suburban
cottage
with
a
garden
having
some
private
means
and
had
brought
up
a
happy
family
in
prosperity
but
he
had
done
nothing
new
bagwax
who
was
twenty
years
his
junior
had
with
manifest
effects
added
a
happy
drop
of
turpentine
to
the
and
in
doing
so
had
broken
curlydown
heart
the
stamping
mixture
had
absolutely
achieved
a
name
which
was
printed
on
the
official
list
of
stores
curlydown
mind
was
vacillating
between
the
new
river
and
a
pension
between
death
in
the
breach
and
acknowledged
defeat
when
a
new
interest
was
lent
to
his
life
by
the
caldigate
envelope
it
was
he
who
had
been
first
sent
by
the
to
sir
john
joram
chambers
but
the
matter
had
become
too
large
for
himself
alone
and
in
an
hour
bagwax
had
been
consulted
now
bagwax
was
to
be
sent
to
sydney
almost
with
the
appointments
of
a
lawyer
they
still
occupied
the
same
room
a
fact
which
infinitely
increased
the
torments
of
curlydown
position
they
ought
to
have
been
moved
very
far
asunder
curlydown
was
still
engaged
in
the
routine
ordinary
work
of
the
day
seeing
that
the
proper
changes
were
made
in
all
the
stamps
used
during
the
various
hours
of
the
day
assuring
himself
that
the
crosses
and
letters
and
figures
upon
which
so
much
of
the
civilisation
of
europe
depended
were
properly
altered
and
arranged
and
it
may
well
be
that
his
own
labours
were
made
heavier
by
the
devotion
of
his
colleagues
to
other
matters
and
yet
from
time
to
time
bagwax
would
ask
him
questions
never
indeed
taking
his
advice
but
still
demanding
his
assistance
curlydown
was
not
naturally
a
man
of
or
an
angry
heart
but
there
were
moments
in
which
he
could
hardly
abstain
from
expressing
himself
with
animosity
on
a
certain
morning
in
august
bagwax
was
seated
at
his
table
which
as
usual
was
laden
with
the
envelopes
of
many
letters
there
were
some
hundreds
before
him
the
marks
on
which
he
was
perusing
with
a
strong
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
was
to
start
on
his
great
journey
in
the
first
week
in
september
and
he
employed
his
time
before
he
went
in
scanning
all
the
envelopes
bearing
the
sydney
postmark
which
he
had
been
able
to
procure
in
england
he
spent
the
entire
day
with
a
in
his
hand
but
as
curlydown
was
also
always
armed
in
the
same
fashion
that
was
not
peculiar
they
did
much
of
their
work
with
such
tools
the
date
on
the
envelope
the
date
conveyed
by
the
impression
to
which
so
much
attention
had
been
given
was
may
bagwax
had
succeeded
in
getting
covers
bearing
dates
very
close
to
that
the
of
may
had
been
among
his
treasures
for
some
time
and
now
he
had
acquired
an
entire
letter
envelope
and
all
which
bore
the
sydney
impression
of
the
may
this
was
a
great
triumph
have
brought
it
within
a
week
he
said
to
curlydown
bending
down
over
his
glass
and
inspecting
at
the
same
time
the
two
dates
the
good
of
that
asked
curlydown
as
he
passed
rapidly
under
his
own
glass
the
stamps
which
it
was
his
duty
to
inspect
from
day
to
day
the
good
in
the
world
said
bagwax
brandishing
his
own
magnifier
with
energy
is
almost
conclusive
now
the
argument
with
bagwax
was
this
that
if
he
found
in
the
sydney
postmarks
of
may
and
in
those
of
may
the
same
deviations
or
bruises
in
the
die
those
deviations
must
have
existed
also
on
the
days
between
these
two
dates
and
as
the
impression
before
him
was
quite
perfect
without
any
deviation
did
it
not
follow
that
it
must
have
been
obtained
in
some
manner
outside
the
ordinary
course
of
business
are
a
dozen
stamps
in
use
at
the
sydney
office
said
curlydown
so
or
at
any
rate
three
or
four
but
i
can
trace
as
well
as
possible
the
times
at
which
new
stamps
were
supplied
look
here
then
he
threw
himself
over
the
multitude
of
envelopes
all
of
which
had
been
carefully
arranged
as
to
dates
and
began
to
point
out
the
periods
you
see
in
there
is
nothing
that
quite
tallies
with
the
caldigate
letter
i
have
measured
them
to
the
twentieth
part
of
an
inch
and
i
am
sure
that
early
in
may
there
was
not
a
stamp
in
use
in
the
sydney
office
which
could
have
made
that
impression
i
have
eighteen
mays
and
not
one
of
them
could
have
been
made
by
the
stamp
that
did
this
as
he
spoke
thus
he
rapped
his
finger
down
on
the
copy
of
the
sacred
envelope
which
he
was
using
not
that
conclusive
it
was
not
conclusive
to
keep
a
man
from
going
to
prison
said
curlydown
remembering
the
failure
of
his
own
examination
will
not
be
conclusive
to
get
him
out
again
i
differ
no
doubt
further
evidence
is
necessary
and
therefore
i
must
go
to
sydney
it
is
conclusive
i
do
see
why
you
should
go
to
sydney
at
all
if
your
proof
is
so
perfect
why
should
that
fellow
be
kept
in
prison
while
you
are
running
about
the
world
this
idea
had
also
occurred
to
bagwax
and
he
had
thought
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
be
magnanimous
enough
to
perfect
his
proof
in
england
so
as
to
get
a
pardon
from
the
secretary
of
state
at
once
to
his
own
manifest
injury
would
satisfy
you
and
me
said
bagwax
satisfy
the
ignorant
to
the
conductor
of
an
omnibus
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
river
the
man
who
does
not
know
what
castle
means
is
ignorant
the
outsider
who
is
in
a
mist
as
to
the
question
or
order
of
the
day
is
ignorant
to
the
member
of
parliament
to
have
no
definite
date
conveyed
by
the
term
sunday
is
to
the
clerical
mind
gross
ignorance
the
horsey
man
thinks
you
have
been
in
bed
all
your
life
if
the
side
is
not
as
descriptive
to
you
as
left
hand
to
bagwax
and
curlydown
not
to
distinguish
postmarks
was
to
be
ignorant
fear
it
would
satisfy
the
ignorant
said
bagwax
thinking
of
his
projected
journey
to
sydney
is
proof
said
curlydown
do
think
you
ever
get
him
out
the
time
has
gone
by
but
you
may
do
just
as
much
here
as
there
sure
we
shall
get
him
out
i
never
rest
in
my
bed
till
we
have
got
him
out
justice
bramber
wo
mind
whether
you
rest
in
your
bed
or
not
nor
yet
the
secretary
of
state
john
joram
began
bagwax
in
these
discussions
sir
john
joram
was
always
his
main
staff
john
joram
has
got
other
fish
to
fry
before
this
time
it
a
marvel
to
me
bagwax
that
they
should
give
way
to
all
this
nonsense
if
anything
could
be
done
it
could
be
done
in
half
the
time
and
if
anything
could
be
done
it
could
be
done
here
by
the
time
you
back
from
sydney
caldigate
time
will
be
half
out
why
do
you
let
sir
john
see
your
proof
you
do
want
to
lose
your
trip
i
suppose
caldigate
was
languishing
in
prison
and
that
poor
nameless
lady
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
he
had
the
proof
lying
there
on
the
table
before
him
sufficient
proof
as
he
did
in
his
heart
believe
but
how
often
does
it
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
clerk
to
be
taken
round
the
world
free
of
expense
the
way
curlydown
put
it
was
and
full
of
envy
bagwax
was
well
aware
that
curlydown
was
instigated
solely
by
envy
but
still
these
were
his
own
convictions
and
bagwax
was
in
truth
a
conscientious
man
do
think
it
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
secretary
of
state
said
he
i
go
to
sir
john
joram
of
course
i
should
like
to
see
the
world
who
would
but
i
rather
be
the
means
of
restoring
that
fellow
to
his
poor
wife
than
be
sent
to
all
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
with
a
guinea
for
personal
expenses
in
this
way
he
nobly
made
up
his
mind
to
go
at
once
to
sir
john
joram
chapter
xlviii
sir
john
joram
chambers
curlydown
insinuations
had
been
very
cruel
but
also
very
powerful
bagwax
as
he
considered
the
matter
that
night
in
his
bed
did
conscientiously
think
that
a
discreet
and
humane
secretary
of
state
would
let
the
unfortunate
husband
out
of
prison
on
the
evidence
which
he
bagwax
had
already
collected
my
readers
will
not
perhaps
agree
with
him
the
finding
of
a
jury
and
the
sentence
of
a
judge
must
be
regarded
seriously
by
secretaries
of
state
and
it
is
probable
that
theory
would
not
make
itself
clear
to
that
great
functionary
a
good
many
were
necessary
if
the
woman
claiming
caldigate
as
her
husband
would
swear
falsely
to
anything
in
that
matter
then
she
would
swear
falsely
to
everything
if
this
envelope
had
never
passed
through
the
sydney
then
she
would
have
sworn
falsely
about
the
letter
and
therefore
her
evidence
would
have
been
altogether
false
if
this
postmark
had
not
been
made
in
the
due
course
of
business
and
on
the
date
as
now
seen
then
the
envelope
had
not
passed
regularly
through
the
sydney
office
so
far
it
was
all
clear
to
the
mind
of
bagwax
and
almost
clear
that
the
postmark
could
not
have
been
made
on
the
date
it
bore
the
result
for
which
he
was
striving
with
true
faith
had
taken
such
a
hold
of
his
mind
he
was
so
adverse
to
the
interest
and
so
generously
anxious
for
john
caldigate
and
the
poor
lady
at
folking
that
he
could
not
see
obstacles
he
could
not
even
clearly
see
the
very
obstacles
which
made
his
own
going
to
sydney
seem
to
others
to
be
necessary
and
yet
he
longed
to
go
to
sydney
with
all
his
heart
he
would
be
almost
if
he
were
robbed
of
that
delight
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
packed
all
his
envelopes
carefully
into
a
large
and
started
in
a
cab
for
sir
john
joram
chambers
are
you
going
with
them
now
curlydown
asked
somewhat
disdainfully
just
as
bagwax
was
starting
curlydown
had
taken
upon
himself
of
late
to
ridicule
the
envelopes
and
had
become
almost
an
bagwax
vouchsafed
to
make
him
no
reply
on
the
previous
afternoon
he
had
declared
his
purpose
of
going
at
once
to
sir
john
and
had
written
as
curlydown
well
knew
a
letter
to
sir
john
clerk
to
make
an
appointment
sir
john
was
known
to
be
in
town
though
it
was
the
end
of
august
being
a
laborious
man
who
contented
himself
with
a
little
by
way
of
holiday
it
had
been
understood
that
he
was
to
see
bagwax
before
his
departure
all
this
had
been
known
to
curlydown
and
the
question
had
been
asked
only
to
exasperate
there
was
a
sarcasm
in
the
which
determined
bagwax
to
start
without
a
word
of
reply
as
he
went
down
to
the
temple
in
the
cab
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
a
great
question
which
often
troubles
many
of
us
how
far
was
he
bound
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
benefit
of
others
he
had
done
his
duty
zealously
in
this
matter
and
now
was
under
orders
to
continue
the
work
in
a
manner
which
opened
up
to
him
a
whole
paradise
of
happiness
how
grand
was
this
opportunity
of
seeing
something
of
the
world
beyond
and
then
the
pecuniary
gain
would
be
so
great
hitherto
he
had
received
no
pay
for
what
he
had
done
he
was
a
simple
clerk
and
was
paid
for
his
time
by
the
crown
very
moderately
on
this
projected
journey
all
his
expenses
would
be
paid
for
him
and
still
he
would
have
his
salary
sir
john
joram
had
declared
the
journey
to
be
quite
necessary
the
secretary
of
state
had
probably
not
occupied
his
mind
much
with
the
matter
but
in
the
mind
of
bagwax
there
was
a
fixed
idea
that
the
secretary
thought
of
little
else
and
that
the
secretary
had
declared
that
his
hands
were
tied
till
bagwax
should
have
been
to
sydney
but
his
conscience
told
him
that
the
journey
was
not
necessary
and
that
the
delay
would
be
cruel
in
that
cab
bagwax
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
his
duty
like
an
honest
man
sir
john
chambers
in
pump
court
were
gloomy
without
though
commodious
and
ample
within
bagwax
was
now
well
known
to
the
clerk
and
was
received
almost
as
a
friend
think
i
got
it
all
as
clear
as
running
water
jones
he
said
feeling
no
doubt
that
sir
clerk
jones
must
feel
that
interest
in
the
case
which
pervaded
his
own
mind
will
be
a
good
thing
for
the
gentleman
in
prison
mr
bagwax
for
the
lady
poor
lady
i
do
know
whether
i
do
think
almost
more
of
her
than
of
him
jones
was
returning
to
his
work
having
sent
in
word
to
sir
john
of
this
visitor
arrival
but
bagwax
was
too
full
of
his
subject
and
of
his
own
honesty
for
that
do
think
that
i
need
go
out
after
all
mr
jones
indeed
course
it
will
be
a
great
sell
for
me
it
now
i
am
told
is
an
elysium
upon
earth
much
the
same
as
botany
bay
is
it
asked
jones
not
at
all
quite
a
different
place
i
was
reading
a
book
the
other
day
which
said
that
sydney
harbour
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
god
ever
made
on
the
face
of
the
globe
know
there
used
to
be
convicts
there
said
jones
very
positively
they
had
a
few
once
but
never
many
they
have
oranges
there
and
a
parliament
almost
as
good
as
our
own
and
a
beautiful
new
but
i
sha
have
to
go
jones
of
course
a
man
has
to
do
his
duty
do
and
more
do
that
as
far
as
i
see
mr
bagwax
all
for
nelson
motto
jones
england
expects
that
every
man
this
day
shall
do
his
duty
in
repeating
these
memorable
words
bagwax
raised
his
voice
john
do
like
to
hear
anything
through
the
partition
mr
bagwax
beg
pardon
but
whenever
i
think
of
that
glorious
observation
i
am
apt
to
become
a
little
excited
it
go
a
long
way
jones
in
keeping
a
man
straight
if
he
only
say
it
to
himself
often
enough
not
to
roar
it
out
in
an
eminent
barrister
chambers
he
hear
you
i
daresay
only
i
thought
i
just
caution
you
right
jones
now
i
mean
to
do
mine
i
think
we
can
get
the
party
out
of
prison
without
any
journey
to
sydney
at
all
and
i
not
going
to
stand
in
the
way
of
it
i
have
devoted
myself
to
this
case
and
i
not
going
to
let
my
own
interest
stand
in
the
way
jones
let
a
man
be
ever
so
humble
england
does
expect
that
he
do
his
duty
george
he
hear
you
bagwax
he
will
indeed
but
at
that
moment
sir
john
bell
was
rung
and
bagwax
was
summoned
into
the
great
man
room
sir
john
was
sitting
at
a
large
so
completely
covered
with
papers
that
a
whole
chaos
of
legal
atoms
seemed
to
have
been
deposited
there
by
the
fortuitous
operation
of
ages
bagwax
who
had
his
large
bag
in
his
hand
looked
forlornly
round
the
room
for
some
freer
and
more
fitting
board
on
which
he
might
expose
his
documents
but
there
was
none
there
were
bookshelves
filled
with
books
and
a
large
sofa
which
was
covered
also
with
papers
and
another
table
laden
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
concrete
chaos
whereas
the
chaos
in
front
of
sir
john
was
a
chaos
in
solution
sir
john
liked
bagwax
though
he
was
generally
opposed
to
zealous
there
was
in
the
man
a
mixture
of
intelligence
and
absurdity
of
real
feeling
and
affectation
of
genuine
humility
as
to
himself
personally
and
of
thorough
confidence
in
himself
which
had
gratified
sir
john
and
sir
john
had
been
quite
sure
that
the
clerk
had
intended
to
speak
the
absolute
truth
with
an
honest
manly
conviction
in
the
innocence
of
his
client
and
in
the
guilt
of
the
witnesses
on
the
other
side
he
was
therefore
well
disposed
towards
bagwax
bagwax
he
said
i
understand
you
have
got
a
little
further
in
the
matter
since
i
saw
you
last
good
deal
further
sir
john
how
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
shortly
this
was
troublesome
bagwax
did
not
think
that
he
could
explain
the
matter
very
shortly
he
could
not
explain
the
matter
at
all
without
showing
his
envelopes
and
how
was
he
to
show
them
in
the
present
condition
of
that
room
he
immediately
dived
into
his
bag
and
brought
forth
the
first
bundle
of
envelopes
sir
john
i
had
better
put
them
out
upon
the
floor
he
said
i
see
all
those
there
were
many
more
bundles
within
which
bagwax
was
anxious
that
the
barrister
should
examine
minutely
is
very
important
sir
john
it
is
indeed
it
is
really
altogether
a
case
of
postmarks
altogether
we
have
never
in
our
branch
had
anything
so
interesting
before
if
we
can
show
that
that
envelope
certainly
was
not
stamped
with
that
postmark
in
the
sydney
on
the
may
then
we
shall
get
him
out
sha
we
will
be
very
material
bagwax
said
sir
john
cautiously
will
all
have
sworn
falsely
and
then
somebody
must
have
obtained
the
postmark
surreptitiously
there
must
have
been
a
regular
plant
the
stamp
must
have
been
made
up
and
dated
on
purpose
so
as
to
give
a
false
date
some
official
in
the
sydney
must
have
been
employed
what
we
want
you
to
find
out
over
there
said
sir
john
who
was
not
quite
so
zealous
perhaps
not
quite
so
conscientious
as
his
more
humble
assistant
whose
mind
was
more
occupied
with
other
matters
find
out
all
that
at
sydney
the
temptation
was
very
great
sir
john
wanted
him
to
go
told
him
that
he
ought
to
go
sir
john
was
the
man
responsible
for
the
whole
matter
he
bagwax
had
done
his
best
could
it
be
right
for
him
to
provoke
sir
john
by
contesting
the
matter
contesting
it
so
much
to
his
own
disadvantage
had
he
not
done
enough
for
honesty
enough
to
satisfy
even
that
grand
idea
of
duty
as
he
turned
the
bundle
of
documents
round
in
his
hand
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
not
done
enough
there
was
a
little
gurgle
in
his
throat
almost
a
tear
in
his
eye
as
he
replied
do
think
i
should
be
wanted
to
go
if
you
would
look
at
these
envelopes
sir
john
understood
it
all
at
once
and
there
was
much
to
understand
he
knew
how
anxious
the
man
was
to
go
on
this
projected
journey
and
he
perceived
the
cause
which
was
inducing
him
to
surrender
his
own
interests
he
remembered
that
the
journey
must
be
made
at
a
great
expense
to
his
own
client
he
ran
over
the
case
in
his
mind
and
acknowledged
to
himself
that
conclusive
evidence
evidence
that
should
be
quite
conclusive
of
fraud
as
to
the
envelope
might
possibly
suffice
to
release
his
client
at
once
from
prison
he
told
himself
also
that
he
could
not
dare
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
matter
himself
without
a
close
inspection
of
those
postmarks
that
a
close
inspection
might
probably
take
two
hours
and
that
the
two
hours
would
finally
have
to
be
abstracted
from
the
already
curtailed
period
of
his
nightly
slumbers
then
he
thought
of
the
state
of
his
tables
and
the
difficulties
as
to
space
perhaps
that
idea
was
the
one
strongest
in
his
mind
against
the
examination
but
then
what
a
hero
was
bagwax
what
was
there
should
he
be
less
ready
to
devote
himself
to
his
client
he
who
was
paid
for
his
work
than
this
clerk
who
was
as
pure
in
his
honesty
as
he
was
zealous
in
the
cause
are
a
great
many
of
them
i
suppose
he
said
almost
whining
good
many
sir
john
at
it
said
the
queen
counsel
and
late
springing
up
from
his
chair
bagwax
almost
jumped
out
of
the
way
so
startled
was
he
by
the
quick
and
sudden
movement
sir
john
rang
his
bell
but
not
waiting
for
the
clerk
began
to
hurl
the
chaos
in
solution
on
to
the
top
of
the
concrete
chaos
bagwax
naturally
attempted
to
assist
him
g
sake
do
you
touch
them
said
sir
john
as
though
avenging
himself
by
a
touch
of
scorn
for
the
evil
thing
which
was
being
done
to
him
then
jones
hurried
into
the
room
and
with
more
careful
hands
assisted
his
master
trying
to
preserve
some
order
with
the
disturbed
papers
in
this
way
the
large
was
within
three
minutes
made
clear
for
the
bagwaxian
strategy
jones
declared
afterwards
that
it
was
seven
years
since
he
had
seen
the
entire
top
of
that
table
go
ahead
said
sir
john
who
seemed
during
the
operation
to
have
lost
something
of
his
ordinary
dignity
bagwax
who
since
that
little
check
had
been
standing
perfectly
still
with
his
open
bag
in
his
hands
at
once
began
his
work
the
plain
before
him
was
immense
and
he
was
able
to
marshal
all
his
forces
in
the
centre
and
nearest
to
sir
john
as
he
sat
in
his
usual
chair
were
exposed
all
the
mays
for
it
was
thus
that
he
denominated
the
envelopes
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
there
were
and
and
and
but
the
were
all
arranged
in
months
and
then
in
days
he
began
by
explaining
that
he
had
obtained
all
these
envelopes
as
he
said
there
had
been
no
selection
none
had
been
rejected
then
courteously
handing
his
official
to
the
barrister
he
invited
him
to
inspect
them
all
generally
to
make
as
it
were
a
first
cursory
inspection
so
that
he
might
see
that
there
was
not
one
perfect
impression
perfect
as
that
impression
on
the
caldigate
envelope
was
perfect
one
said
bagwax
beating
his
bosom
in
triumph
seems
perfect
said
sir
john
pointing
with
the
glass
to
a
selected
specimen
eyes
are
very
good
sir
john
very
good
indeed
you
have
found
the
cleanest
and
truest
of
the
whole
lot
but
if
you
examine
the
tail
of
the
y
you
see
it
been
rubbed
a
little
and
then
if
follow
with
your
eye
the
circular
line
which
makes
up
the
round
of
the
postmark
you
find
a
dent
on
the
outside
bar
i
go
more
on
the
dents
in
those
bars
sir
john
than
i
do
on
the
figures
all
the
bars
are
dented
more
or
less
particularly
the
mays
they
do
remain
quite
true
sir
john
not
after
a
day
fair
use
they
taken
a
new
stamp
out
of
the
store
to
do
the
caldigate
envelope
they
could
get
at
the
stamps
in
use
that
how
it
has
been
sir
john
listened
in
silence
as
he
continued
to
examine
one
envelope
after
another
through
the
glass
sir
john
if
we
come
to
the
mays
we
shall
find
that
just
about
that
time
there
has
been
no
new
stamp
brought
into
use
there
is
one
either
that
is
exactly
the
caldigate
breadth
i
brought
a
rule
by
which
you
can
get
to
the
fiftieth
of
an
inch
here
bagwax
brought
out
a
little
ivory
instrument
marked
all
over
with
figures
course
they
intended
to
be
of
the
same
pattern
but
gradually
very
gradually
the
circle
has
always
become
smaller
that
conclusive
the
caldigate
impression
is
a
little
very
little
ever
so
little
but
a
little
smaller
than
any
of
the
mays
is
that
conclusive
i
understand
it
bagwax
you
do
pretend
to
say
that
you
have
got
impressions
of
all
the
stamps
which
may
have
been
in
use
in
the
sydney
office
at
that
time
but
in
sydney
if
i
understand
the
matter
rightly
they
keep
daily
impressions
of
all
the
stamps
in
a
book
so
just
so
sir
john
said
bagwax
feeling
that
every
word
spoken
to
the
lawyer
renewed
his
own
hopes
of
going
out
to
sydney
but
feeling
also
that
sir
john
would
be
wrong
very
wrong
if
he
subjected
his
client
to
so
unnecessarily
prolonged
a
detention
in
the
cambridge
county
prison
do
keep
a
book
which
would
be
quite
conclusive
i
could
have
the
pages
photographed
not
that
be
best
and
you
might
probably
find
out
who
it
was
who
gave
this
fraudulent
aid
could
find
out
everything
said
bagwax
energetically
what
is
all
found
out
there
it
is
indeed
sir
john
if
i
could
get
you
to
go
along
with
me
you
would
see
that
that
letter
could
have
gone
through
the
sydney
think
i
do
see
it
but
it
is
so
difficult
bagwax
to
make
others
see
things
if
it
did
and
it
never
did
but
if
it
did
why
did
they
say
it
did
why
did
they
swear
it
did
is
that
enough
to
make
any
secretary
let
him
go
the
energy
the
zeal
the
true
faith
of
the
man
were
admirable
sir
john
was
half
disposed
to
rise
from
his
seat
to
embrace
the
man
and
hail
him
as
his
brother
only
that
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
made
himself
as
ridiculous
as
bagwax
zeal
is
always
ridiculous
think
i
see
it
all
he
said
wo
they
let
the
man
go
were
four
persons
who
swore
positively
that
they
were
present
at
the
marriage
one
of
them
being
the
woman
who
is
said
to
have
been
married
that
is
direct
evidence
with
all
our
search
we
have
hitherto
found
no
one
to
give
us
any
direct
evidence
to
rebut
this
then
they
brought
forward
to
corroborate
these
statements
a
certain
amount
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
among
other
things
this
letter
caldigate
envelope
said
bagwax
eagerly
you
call
the
caldigate
envelope
it
was
unnecessary
perhaps
and
if
fraudulent
certainly
foolish
they
would
have
had
their
verdict
without
it
they
did
it
said
bagwax
in
a
tone
of
triumph
is
a
pity
bagwax
you
were
not
brought
up
to
our
profession
you
would
have
made
a
great
lawyer
sir
john
they
did
it
and
if
it
can
be
proved
that
they
have
done
it
fraudulently
no
doubt
that
fraud
will
stain
their
direct
evidence
but
we
have
to
remember
that
the
verdict
has
been
already
obtained
we
are
not
struggling
now
with
a
jury
but
with
an
impassive
emblem
of
sovereign
justice
therefore
the
real
facts
will
go
the
further
sir
john
argued
bagwax
admirably
well
argued
if
you
should
ever
be
called
i
hope
i
may
not
have
you
against
me
very
often
but
i
will
think
of
it
all
you
can
take
the
envelopes
away
with
you
because
you
have
impressed
me
vividly
with
all
that
they
can
tell
me
my
present
impression
is
that
you
had
better
take
the
journey
but
within
the
next
few
days
i
will
give
a
little
more
thought
to
it
and
you
shall
hear
from
me
then
he
put
out
his
hand
which
was
a
courtesy
bagwax
had
never
before
enjoyed
may
believe
me
bagwax
when
i
say
that
i
have
come
across
many
remarkable
men
in
many
cases
which
have
fallen
into
my
hands
but
that
i
have
rarely
encountered
a
man
whom
i
have
more
thoroughly
respected
than
i
do
you
bagwax
went
away
to
his
own
lodging
exulting
but
more
than
ever
resolved
that
the
journey
to
sydney
was
unnecessary
as
usual
he
spent
a
large
portion
of
that
afternoon
in
contemplating
the
envelopes
and
then
as
he
was
doing
so
another
idea
struck
him
an
idea
which
made
him
tear
his
hairs
with
disgust
because
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
there
was
now
opened
to
him
a
new
scope
of
inquiry
an
altogether
different
matter
of
evidence
but
the
idea
was
by
far
too
important
to
be
brought
in
and
explained
at
the
of
a
chapter
chapter
xlix
all
the
shands
there
had
been
something
almost
approaching
to
exultation
at
babington
when
the
tidings
of
caldigate
alleged
australian
wife
were
first
heard
there
as
the
anger
had
been
great
that
julia
should
be
rejected
so
had
the
family
congratulation
been
almost
triumphant
when
the
danger
which
had
been
escaped
was
appreciated
there
had
been
something
of
the
same
feeling
at
pollington
among
the
shands
who
had
no
doubt
allowed
themselves
to
think
that
maria
had
been
by
john
caldigate
he
ought
to
have
married
maria
at
least
such
was
the
opinion
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
who
were
greatly
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
little
book
which
had
been
carried
away
but
in
regard
to
the
australian
marriage
they
had
differed
among
themselves
that
maria
should
have
escaped
the
terrible
doom
which
had
befallen
daughter
was
of
course
a
source
of
comfort
but
maria
herself
would
never
believe
the
evil
story
john
caldigate
had
not
been
well
perhaps
not
quite
true
to
her
so
much
she
acknowledged
gently
with
the
germ
of
a
tear
in
her
eye
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
not
have
married
hester
bolton
while
another
wife
was
living
in
australia
she
arose
almost
to
enthusiasm
as
she
vindicated
his
character
from
so
base
a
stain
he
had
been
perhaps
a
little
unstable
in
his
affections
as
men
are
so
commonly
but
not
even
when
the
jury
found
their
verdict
could
she
be
got
to
believe
that
the
john
caldigate
whom
she
had
known
would
have
betrayed
a
girl
whom
he
loved
as
he
was
supposed
to
have
betrayed
hester
bolton
the
mother
and
sisters
who
knew
the
softness
of
maria
disposition
and
who
had
been
more
angry
than
their
sister
with
the
man
who
had
been
wicked
enough
to
carry
away
thomson
in
his
portmanteau
without
marrying
the
girl
who
had
put
it
there
would
not
agree
to
this
the
verdict
at
any
rate
was
a
verdict
john
caldigate
was
in
prison
the
poor
young
woman
with
her
infant
was
a
nameless
unfortunate
creature
all
this
might
have
happened
to
their
maria
should
always
have
believed
him
innocent
said
maria
wiping
away
the
germ
of
the
tear
with
her
knuckle
the
matter
was
very
often
discussed
in
the
doctor
house
at
pollington
as
it
was
indeed
by
the
public
generally
and
especially
in
the
eastern
counties
but
in
this
house
there
a
double
interest
attached
to
it
in
the
first
place
there
was
maria
escape
which
the
younger
girls
were
accustomed
to
talk
of
as
having
been
miraculous
and
then
there
was
dick
absolute
disappearance
it
had
been
declared
at
the
trial
on
behalf
of
caldigate
that
if
dick
could
have
been
put
into
the
he
would
have
been
able
to
swear
that
there
had
been
no
such
marriage
ceremony
as
that
which
the
four
witnesses
had
elaborately
described
on
the
other
hand
the
woman
and
crinkett
had
sworn
boldly
that
dick
shand
though
not
present
at
the
marriage
had
been
well
aware
that
it
had
taken
place
and
that
dick
could
his
evidence
have
been
secured
would
certainly
have
been
a
witness
on
their
side
he
had
been
outside
the
tent
so
said
the
woman
when
the
marriage
was
being
performed
and
had
refused
to
enter
by
way
of
showing
his
continued
hostility
to
an
arrangement
which
he
had
always
opposed
but
when
the
woman
said
this
it
was
known
that
dick
shand
would
not
appear
and
the
opinion
was
general
that
dick
had
died
in
his
poverty
and
distress
men
who
sink
to
be
shepherds
in
australia
because
they
are
noted
drunkards
generally
do
die
the
constrained
abstinence
of
perhaps
six
months
in
the
wilderness
is
agonising
at
first
and
nearly
fatal
then
the
poor
wretch
rushes
to
the
joys
of
an
orgy
with
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
in
his
pocket
and
the
stuff
which
is
given
to
him
as
brandy
soon
puts
an
end
to
his
sufferings
there
was
but
little
doubt
that
such
had
been
the
fate
of
dick
unless
perhaps
in
the
bosom
of
maria
and
of
his
mother
it
was
known
too
at
pollington
as
well
as
elsewhere
in
the
month
of
august
that
efforts
were
still
to
be
made
with
the
view
of
upsetting
the
verdict
something
had
crept
out
to
the
public
as
to
the
researches
made
by
bagwax
and
allusions
had
been
frequent
as
to
the
unfortunate
absence
of
dick
shand
the
betting
had
there
been
betting
would
no
doubt
have
been
in
favour
of
the
verdict
the
four
witnesses
had
told
their
tale
in
a
straightforward
way
and
though
they
were
from
their
characters
not
entitled
to
perfect
credit
still
their
evidence
had
in
no
wise
been
shaken
they
were
mean
dishonest
folk
no
doubt
they
had
taken
caldigate
money
and
had
still
gone
on
with
the
prosecution
even
if
there
had
been
some
sort
of
a
marriage
the
woman
should
have
taken
herself
off
when
she
had
received
her
money
and
left
poor
hester
to
enjoy
her
happiness
her
husband
and
her
home
at
bolton
that
was
the
general
feeling
but
it
was
hardly
thought
that
bagwax
with
his
envelope
would
prevail
over
judge
bramber
in
the
mind
of
the
secretary
of
state
probably
there
had
been
a
marriage
but
it
was
singular
that
the
two
men
who
could
have
given
unimpeachable
evidence
on
the
matter
should
both
have
vanished
out
of
the
world
allan
the
minister
and
dick
shand
the
miner
and
shepherd
will
she
do
when
he
comes
out
maria
asked
rewble
harriet
the
curate
wife
was
there
rewble
as
curate
found
it
convenient
to
make
frequent
visits
to
his
house
and
posttlethwaite
matilda
was
with
them
as
posttlethwaite
business
in
the
soap
line
caused
him
to
live
at
pollington
and
there
were
two
unmarried
sisters
fanny
and
jane
rewble
was
by
this
time
quite
the
matron
and
posttlethwaite
was
also
the
happy
mother
of
children
but
maria
was
still
maria
fanny
already
had
a
string
to
her
bow
and
jane
was
expectant
of
many
strings
ought
to
go
back
to
her
father
and
mother
of
course
said
rewble
indignantly
know
i
would
said
jane
know
nothing
about
it
miss
and
you
ought
not
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
said
the
curate
wife
jane
at
this
made
a
grimace
which
was
intended
to
be
seen
only
by
her
sister
fanny
is
very
hard
that
two
loving
hearts
should
be
divided
said
maria
never
thought
so
much
of
john
caldigate
as
you
did
said
posttlethwaite
seems
to
have
been
able
to
love
a
good
many
young
women
all
at
the
same
time
like
tasting
a
lot
of
cheeses
till
you
get
the
one
that
suits
you
said
jane
this
offended
the
elder
sister
so
grievously
that
she
declared
she
did
not
know
what
their
mother
was
about
to
allow
such
liberty
to
the
girls
and
then
suggested
that
the
conversation
should
be
changed
sure
i
did
not
say
anything
wrong
said
jane
i
suppose
it
is
like
that
a
gentleman
has
to
find
out
whom
he
likes
best
and
as
he
liked
miss
bolton
best
i
think
it
a
thousand
pities
they
should
be
parted
thousand
pities
said
maria
enthusiastically
as
there
is
a
baby
said
jane
upon
which
rewble
was
again
very
angry
dick
were
to
come
home
he
clear
it
all
up
at
once
said
posttlethwaite
will
never
come
home
said
matilda
mournfully
said
rewble
am
afraid
that
he
has
expiated
all
his
indiscretions
it
should
make
us
who
were
born
girls
thankful
that
we
have
not
been
subjected
to
the
same
temptations
should
like
to
be
a
man
all
the
same
said
jane
do
not
at
all
know
what
you
are
saying
replied
the
monitor
little
have
you
realized
what
poor
dick
must
have
suffered
i
wonder
when
they
are
going
to
let
us
have
tea
i
almost
famished
rewble
was
known
in
the
family
for
having
a
good
appetite
they
were
sitting
at
this
moment
round
a
table
on
the
lawn
at
which
they
intended
to
partake
of
their
evening
meal
the
doctor
might
or
might
not
join
them
shand
who
did
not
like
the
open
air
would
have
hers
sent
to
her
in
the
rewble
would
certainly
be
there
posttlethwaite
who
had
been
home
to
his
dinner
had
gone
back
to
the
you
think
jane
if
you
were
to
go
in
you
could
hurry
them
then
jane
went
in
and
hurried
the
servant
a
strange
man
with
papa
said
jane
as
she
returned
are
always
strange
men
with
papa
said
fanny
daresay
he
has
come
to
have
his
tooth
out
for
the
doctor
practice
was
altogether
general
from
a
baby
to
a
he
attended
to
everything
now
as
he
had
done
forty
years
ago
this
man
is
like
a
patient
the
door
was
half
open
and
i
saw
papa
holding
him
by
both
hands
lunatic
exclaimed
rewble
thinking
that
rewble
ought
to
be
sent
at
once
to
her
father
assistance
was
quite
quiet
and
just
for
a
moment
i
could
see
papa
face
it
was
a
patient
at
all
oh
maria
is
it
child
asked
rewble
do
believe
that
dick
has
come
back
they
all
jumped
up
from
their
seats
suddenly
then
rewble
reseated
herself
is
such
a
fool
she
said
do
believe
it
said
jane
had
yellow
trousers
on
as
if
he
had
come
from
a
long
way
off
and
i
sure
papa
was
very
glad
why
should
he
take
both
his
hands
feel
as
though
my
legs
were
sinking
under
me
said
maria
do
think
it
possible
for
a
moment
said
rewble
you
are
so
romantic
you
would
believe
anything
is
possible
said
posttlethwaite
you
will
remain
here
i
will
go
into
the
house
and
inquire
said
rewble
but
it
did
not
suit
the
others
to
remain
there
for
a
moment
the
suggestion
had
been
so
awful
that
they
had
not
dared
to
stir
but
when
the
elder
sister
slowly
moved
towards
the
door
which
led
into
the
house
from
the
garden
they
all
followed
her
then
suddenly
they
heard
a
scream
which
they
knew
to
come
from
their
mother
believe
it
is
dick
said
rewble
standing
in
the
doorway
so
as
to
detain
the
others
ought
we
to
do
me
go
in
said
jane
impetuously
is
my
brother
maria
was
already
dissolved
in
tears
posttlethwaite
was
struck
dumb
by
the
awfulness
of
the
occasion
and
clung
fast
to
her
sister
matilda
will
be
like
one
from
the
grave
said
rewble
solemnly
me
go
in
repeated
jane
impetuously
then
she
pushed
by
her
sisters
and
was
the
first
to
enter
the
house
they
all
followed
her
into
the
hall
and
there
they
found
their
mother
supported
in
the
arms
of
the
man
who
wore
the
yellow
trousers
dick
shand
had
in
truth
returned
to
his
father
house
the
first
thing
to
do
with
a
returned
prodigal
is
to
kiss
him
and
the
next
to
feed
him
and
therefore
dick
was
led
away
at
once
to
the
table
on
the
lawn
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
requiring
the
immediate
slaughter
of
a
fatted
calf
though
he
had
not
exactly
the
appearance
of
a
english
gentleman
he
did
not
seem
to
be
in
want
the
yellow
trousers
were
of
strong
material
and
in
good
order
made
of
that
colour
for
colonial
use
probably
with
the
idea
of
expressing
some
contempt
for
the
dingy
hues
which
prevail
among
the
legs
of
men
at
home
he
wore
a
very
large
checked
waistcoat
and
a
stout
square
coat
of
the
same
material
there
was
no
look
of
poverty
and
no
doubt
he
had
that
day
eaten
a
substantial
dinner
but
the
anxious
mother
was
desirous
of
feeding
him
immediately
and
whispered
to
jane
some
instructions
as
to
cold
beef
which
was
to
be
added
to
the
tea
and
toast
as
they
examined
him
holding
him
by
the
arms
and
hands
and
gazing
up
into
his
face
the
same
idea
occurred
to
all
of
them
though
they
knew
him
very
well
now
they
would
hardly
have
known
him
had
they
met
him
suddenly
in
the
streets
he
seemed
to
have
grown
fifteen
years
older
during
the
seven
years
of
his
absence
his
face
had
become
thin
and
long
and
almost
hollow
his
beard
went
all
round
under
his
chin
and
was
clipped
into
the
appearance
of
a
stiff
thick
hedge
equally
thick
and
equally
broad
and
equally
protrusive
at
all
parts
and
within
this
enclosure
it
was
shorn
but
his
mouth
had
sunk
in
and
his
eyes
in
colour
he
was
almost
darker
than
brown
you
would
have
said
that
his
skin
had
been
tanned
black
but
for
the
infusion
of
red
across
it
here
and
there
he
seemed
to
be
in
good
present
health
but
certainly
bore
the
traces
of
many
hardships
here
you
are
all
just
as
i
left
you
he
said
counting
up
his
sisters
exactly
said
rewble
remembering
her
family
matilda
has
got
two
husbands
i
hope
said
dick
dick
that
is
so
like
you
said
jane
getting
up
and
kissing
him
again
in
her
delight
then
rewble
came
forward
and
the
renewed
their
old
acquaintance
seems
just
like
the
other
day
said
dick
looking
round
upon
the
my
boy
my
darling
darling
boy
said
the
mother
who
had
hurried
for
her
shawl
conscious
of
her
rheumatism
even
amidst
the
excitement
of
her
son
return
dick
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
all
my
life
would
you
like
something
better
than
tea
this
she
said
with
many
memories
and
many
thoughts
but
still
with
a
mother
love
unable
to
refrain
from
offering
what
she
thought
her
son
would
wish
to
have
ai
anything
better
said
dick
very
solemnly
half
so
good
to
my
thinking
said
rewble
imagining
that
by
a
word
in
season
she
might
help
the
good
work
the
mother
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
but
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
a
word
then
there
was
a
silence
for
a
few
moments
us
all
about
it
dick
said
the
father
whisky
inside
if
you
like
it
dick
shook
his
head
solemnly
but
as
they
all
thought
with
a
certain
air
of
regret
tell
us
what
you
have
to
say
repeated
the
doctor
sworn
off
these
two
years
nothing
for
two
years
said
the
mother
exultingly
with
her
arms
and
shawl
again
round
her
son
neck
teetotaller
said
maria
you
like
to
call
it
only
what
a
gentleman
habits
are
in
that
respect
need
be
made
the
subject
of
general
remark
it
was
evident
he
was
a
little
sore
and
jane
therefore
offered
him
a
dish
full
of
gooseberries
he
took
the
plate
in
his
hand
and
ate
them
assiduously
for
a
while
in
silence
as
though
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
know
all
about
it
now
do
you
my
dearest
boy
ejaculated
the
mother
did
get
better
gooseberries
than
those
on
your
travels
said
the
doctor
calling
him
back
to
the
condition
of
the
world
around
him
then
he
told
them
of
his
adventures
for
two
terrible
years
he
had
been
a
shepherd
on
different
up
in
queensland
then
he
had
found
employment
on
a
sugar
plantation
and
had
superintended
the
work
of
a
gang
of
south
sea
islanders
canakers
they
are
called
men
who
are
brought
into
the
colony
from
the
islands
of
the
pacific
and
who
return
thence
to
their
homes
generally
every
three
years
much
to
the
regret
of
their
employers
in
the
transit
of
these
men
agents
are
employed
and
to
this
service
dick
had
after
a
term
found
himself
promoted
then
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
had
remained
for
a
period
on
one
of
these
islands
with
the
view
of
persuading
the
men
to
emigrate
and
reemigrate
and
had
thus
been
resident
among
them
for
more
than
a
couple
of
years
they
had
used
him
well
and
he
had
liked
the
islands
having
lived
in
one
of
them
without
seeing
another
european
for
many
months
then
the
payments
which
had
from
time
to
time
been
made
to
him
by
the
queensland
planters
were
stopped
and
his
business
such
as
it
had
been
came
to
an
end
he
had
found
himself
with
just
sufficient
money
to
bring
him
home
and
here
he
was
boy
my
darling
boy
exclaimed
his
mother
again
as
though
all
their
joint
troubles
were
now
over
the
doctor
remembered
the
adage
of
the
rolling
stone
and
felt
that
the
return
of
a
son
at
the
age
of
thirty
without
any
means
of
maintaining
himself
was
hardly
an
unalloyed
blessing
he
was
not
the
man
to
turn
a
son
out
of
doors
he
had
always
broadened
his
back
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
his
large
family
but
even
at
this
moment
he
was
a
little
melancholy
as
he
thought
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
employment
for
the
wearer
of
those
yellow
trousers
how
was
it
possible
that
a
man
should
continue
to
live
an
altogether
idle
life
at
pollington
and
still
remain
a
teetotaller
you
any
plans
i
can
help
you
in
now
he
asked
course
he
remain
at
home
for
a
while
before
he
thinks
of
anything
said
the
mother
suppose
i
must
look
about
me
said
dick
what
has
become
of
john
caldigate
they
all
at
once
gazed
at
each
other
it
could
hardly
be
that
he
did
not
in
truth
know
what
had
become
of
john
caldigate
you
heard
asked
maria
course
he
has
heard
said
rewble
must
have
heard
said
the
mother
do
in
the
least
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
have
heard
nothing
at
all
in
very
truth
he
had
heard
nothing
of
his
old
friend
not
even
that
he
had
returned
to
england
then
by
degrees
the
whole
story
was
told
to
him
know
that
he
was
putting
a
lot
of
money
together
said
dick
enviously
hester
bolton
i
thought
he
would
bigamy
euphemia
smith
married
before
certainly
not
at
the
diggings
was
married
up
at
ahalala
asked
the
doctor
euphemia
smith
i
was
there
when
they
quarrelled
and
when
she
went
into
partnership
with
crinkett
i
am
sure
there
was
no
such
marriage
john
caldigate
in
prison
for
bigamy
and
he
paid
them
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
more
fool
he
all
say
that
it
an
infernal
plant
as
sure
as
my
name
is
richard
shand
john
caldigate
never
married
that
woman
chapter
l
again
at
sir
john
chambers
and
this
was
the
man
as
to
whom
it
had
been
acknowledged
that
his
evidence
if
it
could
be
obtained
would
be
final
the
return
of
dick
himself
was
to
the
shands
an
affair
so
much
more
momentous
than
the
release
of
john
caldigate
from
prison
that
for
some
hours
or
so
the
latter
subject
was
allowed
to
pass
out
of
sight
the
mother
got
him
and
asked
after
his
linen
vain
inquiry
and
arranged
for
his
bed
turning
all
the
little
rewbles
into
one
small
room
in
the
long
run
grandmothers
are
more
tender
to
their
than
their
own
offspring
but
at
this
moment
dick
was
predominant
how
grand
a
thing
to
have
her
son
returned
to
her
and
such
a
son
a
teetotaller
of
two
years
growth
who
had
seen
all
the
world
of
the
pacific
ocean
as
he
could
not
take
would
he
like
before
he
went
to
bed
or
arrowroot
dick
decided
in
favour
of
and
consented
to
be
embraced
again
it
was
i
think
to
maria
credit
that
she
was
the
first
to
bring
back
the
conversation
to
john
caldigate
marriage
she
a
very
horrible
woman
maria
asked
referring
to
euphemia
smith
were
a
good
many
of
out
there
greedy
after
gold
said
dick
she
beat
all
and
she
was
awfully
clever
what
way
dick
asked
rewble
because
she
does
not
seem
to
me
to
have
done
very
well
with
herself
knew
more
about
shares
than
any
man
of
them
all
but
i
think
she
just
drank
a
little
it
was
that
which
disgusted
caldigate
had
been
very
fond
of
her
suggested
maria
never
knew
a
man
so
taken
with
a
woman
maria
blushed
and
rewble
looked
round
at
her
younger
sisters
as
though
desirous
that
they
should
be
sent
to
bed
that
began
on
board
the
ship
then
he
was
fool
enough
to
run
after
her
down
to
sydney
and
of
course
she
followed
him
up
to
the
mines
do
know
why
of
course
said
posttlethwaite
defending
her
sex
generally
she
did
and
he
was
going
to
marry
her
he
did
mean
to
marry
her
there
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
was
a
queer
kind
of
life
we
lived
up
there
suppose
so
said
the
doctor
rewble
again
looked
at
the
girls
and
then
at
her
mother
but
shand
was
older
and
less
timid
than
her
married
daughter
rewble
when
a
girl
herself
had
never
been
sent
away
and
was
now
a
pattern
of
female
discretion
she
continued
dick
soon
as
she
had
begun
to
finger
the
scrip
thought
of
nothing
but
gold
she
did
not
care
much
for
marriage
just
then
because
she
fancied
the
stuff
would
belong
to
herself
she
became
largely
concerned
in
the
old
that
was
crinkett
concern
and
there
were
times
at
which
i
thought
she
would
marry
him
then
caldigate
got
rid
of
her
altogether
that
was
before
i
went
away
never
married
her
asked
the
doctor
certainly
had
married
her
when
i
left
nobble
in
june
can
swear
to
that
dick
i
can
i
was
with
him
every
day
but
there
was
anyone
round
there
who
did
know
how
it
was
crinkett
himself
knew
it
is
one
of
the
gang
against
him
there
was
a
man
named
adamson
adamson
knew
another
of
the
conspirators
said
the
doctor
wo
dare
to
say
before
me
declared
dick
stoutly
smith
and
john
caldigate
had
become
man
and
wife
before
june
and
they
hated
one
another
so
much
then
that
it
is
impossible
they
should
have
come
together
since
i
can
swear
they
were
not
married
up
to
june
have
to
swear
it
said
the
doctor
that
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
all
this
took
place
towards
the
end
of
august
about
five
weeks
after
the
trial
and
a
day
or
two
subsequent
to
the
interview
between
bagwax
and
the
bagwax
was
now
vehemently
prosecuting
his
inquiries
as
to
that
other
idea
which
had
struck
him
and
was
at
this
very
moment
glowing
with
the
anticipation
of
success
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
conviction
that
he
never
would
see
the
pleasant
things
of
new
south
wales
on
the
next
morning
under
the
auspices
of
his
father
dick
shand
wrote
the
following
letter
to
seely
the
attorney
sir
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
i
reached
my
father
house
in
this
town
late
yesterday
evening
i
have
come
direct
from
one
of
the
south
sea
islands
honolulu
and
san
francisco
and
have
not
yet
been
in
england
hours
i
am
an
old
friend
of
john
caldigate
and
went
with
him
from
england
to
the
gold
diggings
in
new
south
wales
my
name
will
be
known
to
you
as
i
am
now
aware
that
it
was
frequently
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
late
trial
it
will
probably
seem
odd
to
you
that
i
had
never
even
heard
of
the
trial
till
i
reached
my
father
house
last
night
i
did
not
know
that
caldigate
had
married
miss
bolton
nor
that
euphemia
smith
had
claimed
him
as
her
husband
am
able
and
willing
to
swear
that
they
had
not
become
man
and
wife
up
to
june
and
that
no
one
at
ahalala
or
nobble
conceived
them
to
be
man
and
wife
of
course
they
had
lived
together
but
everybody
knew
all
about
it
some
time
before
june
early
i
should
say
in
that
autumn
there
had
been
a
quarrel
i
am
sure
they
were
at
daggers
drawn
with
each
other
all
that
april
and
may
in
respect
to
certain
mining
shares
as
to
which
euphemia
smith
behaved
very
badly
i
do
think
it
possible
that
they
should
ever
have
come
together
again
but
in
may
which
is
the
date
i
have
heard
named
they
certainly
were
not
man
and
wife
have
thought
it
right
to
inform
you
of
this
immediately
on
my
return
and
am
your
obedient
servant
shand
seely
when
he
received
this
letter
found
it
to
be
his
duty
to
take
it
at
once
to
sir
john
joram
up
in
london
he
did
not
believe
dick
shand
but
then
he
had
put
no
trust
in
bagwax
and
had
been
from
the
first
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
caldigate
had
married
the
woman
as
soon
as
it
was
known
to
him
that
his
client
had
paid
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
crinkett
and
the
woman
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
guilt
of
his
client
he
had
done
the
best
for
caldigate
at
the
trial
as
he
would
have
done
for
any
other
client
but
he
had
never
felt
any
of
that
enthusiasm
which
had
instigated
sir
john
now
that
caldigate
was
in
prison
seely
thought
that
he
might
as
well
be
left
there
quietly
trusting
to
the
verdict
trusting
to
judge
bramber
and
trusting
still
more
strongly
on
his
own
early
impressions
this
letter
from
dick
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
ruined
drunkard
a
disgrace
to
his
family
and
an
outcast
from
society
was
to
his
thinking
just
such
a
letter
as
would
be
got
up
in
such
a
case
in
the
futile
hope
of
securing
the
succour
of
a
secretary
of
state
he
was
sure
that
no
secretary
of
state
would
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
such
a
letter
but
still
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
show
it
to
sir
john
and
as
a
trip
to
london
was
not
disagreeable
to
his
professional
mind
he
started
with
it
on
the
very
day
of
its
receipt
course
we
must
have
his
deposition
on
oath
said
sir
john
think
it
will
be
worth
while
i
am
more
convinced
than
ever
that
there
was
no
marriage
that
clerk
has
been
with
me
bagwax
and
has
altogether
convinced
me
did
think
so
much
of
bagwax
sir
john
dare
say
not
seely
an
absurdly
energetic
man
one
of
those
who
destroy
by
their
all
the
credit
which
their
truth
and
energy
ought
to
produce
but
he
has
i
think
convinced
me
that
that
letter
could
not
have
passed
through
the
sydney
in
may
so
sir
john
even
that
is
not
much
towards
upsetting
a
verdict
good
deal
i
think
when
the
characters
of
the
persons
are
considered
now
comes
this
man
whom
we
all
should
have
believed
had
he
been
present
and
tells
this
story
you
had
better
get
hold
of
him
and
bring
him
to
me
mr
seely
then
seely
hung
up
his
hat
in
london
for
three
or
four
days
and
sent
to
pollington
for
dick
shand
dick
shand
obeyed
the
order
and
both
of
them
waited
together
upon
sir
john
have
come
back
at
a
very
critical
point
of
time
for
your
friend
said
the
barrister
dick
had
laid
aside
the
coat
and
waistcoat
with
the
broad
checks
and
the
yellow
trousers
and
had
made
himself
look
as
much
like
an
english
gentleman
as
the
assistance
of
a
shop
at
pollington
would
permit
but
still
he
did
not
quite
look
like
a
man
who
had
spent
three
years
at
cambridge
his
experiences
among
the
gold
diggings
then
his
period
of
maddening
desolation
as
a
queensland
shepherd
and
after
that
his
life
among
the
savages
in
a
south
sea
island
had
done
much
to
change
him
sir
john
and
seely
together
almost
oppressed
him
but
still
he
was
minded
to
speak
up
for
his
friend
caldigate
had
upon
the
whole
been
very
good
to
him
and
dick
was
honest
has
been
badly
used
any
way
he
said
have
had
no
intercourse
with
any
of
his
friends
since
you
have
been
home
i
think
this
question
sir
john
asked
because
seely
had
suggested
that
this
appearance
of
the
man
at
this
special
moment
might
not
improbably
be
what
he
called
a
have
had
no
intercourse
with
anybody
sir
i
came
here
last
friday
and
i
had
spoken
a
word
to
anybody
before
that
i
did
know
that
caldigate
had
been
in
trouble
at
all
my
people
at
pollington
were
the
first
to
tell
me
about
it
you
wrote
to
seely
you
have
heard
of
mr
seely
governor
that
my
father
he
had
heard
of
seely
i
wrote
first
as
he
told
me
they
knew
all
about
it
at
pollington
as
well
as
you
do
were
surprised
then
when
you
heard
the
story
off
my
pins
sir
i
never
was
so
much
taken
aback
in
my
life
to
be
told
that
john
caldigate
had
married
euphemia
smith
after
all
that
i
had
seen
and
that
he
had
been
married
to
her
in
may
i
knew
of
course
that
it
was
all
a
thing
and
he
in
prison
is
in
prison
certainly
bigamy
he
is
mr
shand
how
about
his
real
wife
real
wife
as
you
call
her
is
as
sure
as
my
name
is
richard
shand
is
on
behalf
of
that
lady
that
we
are
almost
more
anxious
than
for
caldigate
himself
in
this
matter
she
has
been
perfectly
innocent
and
whoever
may
have
been
the
culprit
or
culprits
she
has
been
cruelly
have
her
husband
back
again
of
course
said
dick
will
depend
in
part
upon
what
faith
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
may
place
in
your
story
your
deposition
shall
be
taken
and
it
will
be
my
duty
to
submit
it
to
the
secretary
of
state
he
will
probably
be
actuated
by
the
weight
which
this
further
evidence
will
have
upon
the
judge
who
heard
the
former
evidence
you
will
understand
shand
that
your
word
will
be
opposed
to
the
words
of
four
other
persons
perjured
scoundrels
said
dick
with
energy
so
if
your
story
be
true
is
true
sir
said
dick
with
much
anger
in
his
tone
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
you
are
on
the
same
side
with
us
you
know
i
only
want
to
make
you
understand
how
much
ground
there
may
be
for
doubt
it
is
not
easy
to
upset
a
verdict
and
i
fear
many
righteous
verdicts
would
be
upset
if
the
testimony
of
one
man
could
do
it
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
prove
that
you
only
arrived
at
liverpool
on
saturday
night
i
can
can
not
prove
that
you
had
not
heard
of
the
case
before
i
can
i
can
swear
it
sir
john
smiled
all
knew
that
at
pollington
they
told
me
of
it
the
governor
told
me
about
seely
and
made
me
write
the
letter
would
not
be
evidence
said
sir
john
on
earth
i
tell
you
i
was
struck
all
on
a
heap
when
i
heard
it
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
said
he
been
hung
for
murder
you
put
crinkett
and
me
together
and
then
you
know
i
suppose
you
think
somebody
paying
me
for
this
that
i
got
a
regular
tip
at
all
shand
and
i
quite
understand
that
it
should
be
difficult
for
you
to
understand
when
a
man
sees
a
thing
clearly
himself
he
can
not
always
realise
the
fact
that
others
do
not
see
it
also
i
think
i
perceive
what
you
have
to
tell
us
and
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
forward
so
immediately
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
sitting
in
the
other
room
for
five
minutes
while
i
say
a
word
to
mr
seely
can
go
away
altogether
seely
will
be
glad
to
see
you
again
with
reference
to
the
deposition
you
will
have
to
make
you
shall
not
be
kept
waiting
long
then
dick
returned
with
a
sore
heart
feeling
half
inclined
to
blaze
out
in
wrath
against
the
great
advocate
he
had
come
forward
to
tell
a
plain
story
having
nothing
to
gain
paying
his
railway
fare
and
other
expenses
out
of
his
own
or
rather
out
of
his
father
pocket
and
was
told
he
would
not
be
believed
it
is
always
hard
to
make
an
honest
witness
understand
that
it
may
be
the
duty
of
others
to
believe
him
to
be
a
liar
and
dick
shand
did
not
understand
it
now
was
no
australian
marriage
sir
john
said
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
seely
think
not
mind
is
clear
about
it
we
must
get
that
man
out
if
it
be
only
for
the
sake
of
the
lady
is
so
very
easy
sir
john
to
have
a
story
like
that
made
up
have
had
to
do
with
a
good
many
stories
seely
and
with
a
good
many
true
stories
course
sir
john
no
man
with
more
might
be
a
party
to
making
up
a
story
there
is
nothing
that
i
have
seen
in
him
to
make
me
sure
that
he
could
not
come
forward
with
a
determined
perjury
i
should
think
it
but
it
would
be
possible
but
his
father
and
mother
and
sisters
would
join
him
dick
had
told
the
story
of
the
meeting
on
the
lawn
at
great
length
had
it
been
a
plot
he
could
have
imposed
upon
them
he
would
have
brought
them
into
it
and
who
would
have
got
at
him
to
arrange
the
plot
caldigate
sir
john
shook
his
head
old
caldigate
nor
young
caldigate
knew
anything
of
that
kind
of
work
and
then
his
story
tallies
altogether
with
my
hero
bagwax
of
bagwax
i
am
quite
sure
and
as
shand
corroborates
bagwax
i
am
nearly
sure
of
him
also
you
must
take
his
deposition
and
let
me
have
it
it
should
be
rather
full
as
it
may
be
necessary
to
hear
the
depositions
also
of
the
doctor
and
his
wife
we
shall
have
to
get
him
out
know
best
sir
john
shall
have
to
get
him
out
seely
i
think
said
sir
john
rising
from
his
chair
then
seely
took
his
leave
as
was
intended
seely
was
not
at
all
convinced
he
was
quite
willing
that
john
caldigate
should
be
released
from
prison
and
that
the
australian
marriage
should
be
so
put
out
of
general
credit
in
england
as
to
allow
the
young
people
to
live
in
comfort
at
folking
as
man
and
wife
but
he
liked
to
feel
that
he
knew
better
himself
he
would
have
been
quite
content
that
john
caldigate
should
be
john
caldigate
to
all
the
world
that
all
the
world
should
be
imposed
on
so
that
he
was
made
subject
to
no
imposition
in
this
matter
sir
john
appeared
to
him
to
be
no
wider
awake
than
a
mere
layman
it
was
clear
to
seely
that
dick
shand
story
was
up
and
very
well
got
up
he
had
no
pang
of
conscience
as
to
using
it
but
when
it
came
to
believing
it
that
was
quite
another
thing
the
man
turning
up
exactly
at
the
moment
and
such
a
man
and
then
his
pretending
never
to
have
heard
of
a
case
so
famous
never
to
have
heard
this
story
of
his
most
intimate
friend
and
then
his
notorious
poverty
old
caldigate
would
of
course
be
able
to
buy
such
a
man
and
then
sir
john
fatuity
as
to
bagwax
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
believe
that
sir
john
was
quite
in
earnest
but
he
was
well
aware
that
sir
john
would
know
no
one
better
by
what
arguments
such
a
verdict
as
had
been
given
might
be
practically
set
aside
the
verdict
would
remain
but
a
pardon
if
a
pardon
could
be
got
from
the
secretary
of
state
would
make
the
condition
of
the
husband
and
wife
the
same
as
though
there
had
been
no
verdict
the
indignities
which
they
had
already
suffered
would
simply
produce
for
them
the
affectionate
commendation
of
all
england
seely
felt
all
that
and
was
not
at
all
averse
to
a
pardon
he
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
be
severe
on
caldigate
senior
if
as
he
thought
caldigate
senior
had
bribed
this
convenient
new
witness
but
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
he
should
believe
it
all
himself
must
come
with
me
shand
he
said
we
must
take
your
story
down
in
writing
then
you
must
swear
to
it
before
a
magistrate
right
mr
seely
must
be
very
particular
you
know
need
be
particular
at
all
and
as
to
what
sir
john
joram
said
i
felt
half
inclined
to
punch
his
head
would
have
helped
us
was
only
that
i
thought
of
caldigate
in
prison
that
i
did
do
it
because
i
have
been
roaming
about
the
world
not
always
quite
as
well
off
as
himself
he
tells
me
that
he
does
believe
my
word
do
think
he
said
that
did
quite
dare
but
what
he
said
was
as
bad
he
told
me
that
some
one
else
would
believe
it
i
do
quite
understand
what
it
is
they
not
to
believe
all
i
say
is
that
they
two
were
not
married
in
may
about
your
never
having
heard
of
the
case
till
you
got
home
never
had
heard
a
word
about
it
one
would
think
that
i
had
done
something
wrong
in
coming
forward
to
tell
what
i
know
the
deposition
however
was
drawn
out
in
due
form
at
considerable
length
and
was
properly
attested
before
one
of
the
london
magistrates
chapter
li
dick
shand
goes
to
cambridgeshire
the
news
of
shand
return
was
soon
common
in
cambridge
the
tidings
of
course
were
told
to
caldigate
and
were
then
made
known
by
him
to
hester
the
old
man
though
he
turned
the
matter
much
in
his
mind
doubting
whether
the
hopes
thus
raised
would
not
add
to
sorrow
should
they
not
ultimately
be
realised
decided
that
he
could
not
keep
her
in
the
dark
her
belief
could
not
be
changed
by
any
statement
which
shand
might
make
her
faith
was
so
strong
that
no
evidence
could
shake
it
or
confirm
it
but
there
would
no
doubt
arise
in
her
mind
a
hope
of
liberation
if
any
new
evidence
against
the
australian
marriage
were
to
reach
her
which
hope
might
so
probably
be
delusive
but
he
knew
her
to
be
strong
to
endure
as
well
as
strong
to
hope
and
therefore
he
told
her
at
once
then
seely
returned
to
cambridge
and
all
the
facts
of
shand
deposition
were
made
known
at
folking
will
get
him
out
at
once
of
course
said
hester
triumphantly
as
soon
as
she
heard
it
but
the
squire
was
older
and
more
cautious
and
still
doubted
he
explained
that
dick
shand
was
not
a
man
who
by
his
simple
word
would
certainly
convince
a
secretary
of
state
that
deceit
might
be
suspected
that
a
fraudulent
plot
would
be
possible
and
that
very
much
care
was
necessary
before
a
convicted
prisoner
would
be
released
am
quite
sure
from
seely
manner
that
he
thinks
i
have
bribed
the
young
man
said
caldigate
i
these
are
the
ideas
which
naturally
come
into
people
heads
i
am
not
in
the
least
angry
with
seely
and
feel
that
it
is
only
too
likely
that
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
judge
will
think
the
same
if
i
were
secretary
of
state
i
should
have
to
think
so
could
suspect
people
like
that
therefore
my
dear
you
are
hardly
fit
to
be
secretary
of
state
we
must
not
be
too
sanguine
that
is
all
but
hester
was
very
sanguine
when
it
was
fully
known
that
dick
had
written
to
seely
immediately
on
his
arrival
at
pollington
and
that
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
warm
partisan
in
the
caldigate
interests
she
could
not
rest
till
she
saw
him
herself
and
persuaded
caldigate
to
invite
him
down
to
folking
to
folking
therefore
he
went
with
the
full
intention
of
declaring
john
caldigate
innocence
not
only
there
but
all
through
cambridgeshire
the
boltons
of
whom
he
had
now
heard
something
should
be
made
to
know
what
an
honest
man
had
to
say
on
the
subject
an
honest
man
and
who
was
really
on
the
spot
at
the
time
to
dick
mind
it
was
marvellous
that
the
boltons
should
have
been
anxious
to
secure
a
verdict
against
caldigate
which
verdict
was
also
against
their
own
daughter
and
their
own
sister
being
quite
sure
himself
that
caldigate
was
innocent
he
could
not
understand
the
condition
of
feeling
which
would
be
produced
by
an
equally
strong
conviction
of
his
guilt
nor
was
his
mind
probably
imbued
with
much
of
that
religious
scruple
which
made
the
idea
of
a
feigned
marriage
so
insupportable
to
all
hester
relations
nor
was
he
aware
that
when
a
man
has
taken
a
preconception
home
to
himself
and
fastened
it
and
fixed
it
as
it
were
into
his
bosom
he
can
not
easily
expel
it
even
though
personal
interest
should
be
on
the
side
of
such
expulsion
it
had
become
a
settled
belief
with
the
boltons
that
john
caldigate
was
a
bigamist
which
belief
had
certainly
been
strengthened
by
the
pertinacious
hostility
of
hester
mother
dick
had
heard
something
of
all
this
and
thought
that
he
would
be
able
to
open
their
eyes
when
he
arrived
at
folking
he
was
received
with
open
arms
sir
john
joram
had
not
quite
liked
him
because
his
manner
had
been
rough
seely
had
regarded
him
from
the
first
as
a
ruined
man
and
therefore
a
willing
perjurer
even
at
pollington
his
manners
had
been
a
little
distasteful
to
all
except
his
mother
caldigate
felt
some
difficulty
in
making
conversation
with
him
but
to
hester
he
was
as
an
angel
from
heaven
she
was
never
tired
of
hearing
from
him
every
detail
as
to
her
husband
life
at
ahalala
and
nobble
particularly
as
to
his
life
after
euphemia
smith
had
taken
herself
to
those
parts
and
had
quarrelled
with
him
the
fact
of
the
early
infatuation
had
been
acknowledged
on
all
sides
hester
was
able
to
refer
to
that
as
a
mother
boasting
of
her
child
health
may
refer
to
the
measles
which
have
been
bad
and
are
past
and
gone
euphemia
smith
had
been
her
measles
men
generally
have
the
measles
that
was
a
thing
so
completely
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
now
the
source
of
discomfort
and
the
disease
had
been
very
bad
with
him
so
bad
that
he
had
talked
of
marriage
had
promised
marriage
crafty
women
do
get
hold
of
innocent
men
and
drive
them
sometimes
into
perdition
often
to
the
brink
of
perdition
that
was
hester
theory
as
to
her
husband
he
had
been
on
the
brink
but
had
been
wise
in
time
that
was
her
creed
and
as
it
was
supported
by
dick
she
found
no
fault
with
dick
manner
not
even
with
the
yellow
trousers
which
were
brought
into
use
at
folking
were
with
him
on
that
very
day
she
said
this
referred
to
the
day
in
april
on
which
it
had
been
sworn
that
the
marriage
was
solemnized
was
with
him
every
day
about
that
time
i
ca
say
about
particular
days
the
truth
is
i
do
mind
telling
you
caldigate
i
was
drinking
a
good
deal
just
then
his
present
state
of
abstinence
had
of
course
become
known
at
folking
not
without
the
expression
of
much
marvel
on
the
part
of
the
old
squire
as
to
the
quantity
of
tea
which
their
visitor
was
able
to
swallow
and
as
this
abstinence
had
of
course
been
admired
dick
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
confessing
his
past
backslidings
to
a
pretty
sympathetic
friendly
woman
who
was
willing
to
believe
all
that
he
said
and
to
make
much
of
him
i
suppose
then
she
hesitated
and
dick
understood
the
hesitation
was
never
so
bad
said
he
what
i
knew
very
well
what
was
going
on
i
do
believe
caldigate
and
smith
even
so
much
as
spoke
to
each
other
all
that
month
she
had
had
a
wonderful
turn
of
luck
getting
gold
had
bought
and
sold
shares
till
she
was
supposed
to
have
made
a
pot
of
money
people
up
there
got
an
idea
that
she
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
and
it
did
seem
so
then
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
want
caldigate
to
know
about
her
money
and
he
was
downright
sick
of
her
she
had
been
at
one
time
mrs
caldigate
daresay
most
of
them
are
so
i
suppose
clever
she
talk
the
off
a
dog
as
we
used
to
say
out
there
had
very
odd
sayings
mr
shand
we
had
but
when
she
got
in
that
way
about
her
money
and
then
took
to
drinking
brandy
caldigate
was
only
too
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
crinkett
believed
in
her
because
she
had
such
a
run
of
luck
she
held
a
lot
of
his
shares
shares
that
used
to
be
his
so
they
got
together
and
she
left
ahalala
and
went
to
polyeuka
hall
i
remember
it
all
as
if
it
were
yesterday
when
i
broke
away
from
caldigate
in
june
and
went
to
queensland
they
had
seen
each
other
for
two
months
and
as
for
having
been
married
you
might
as
well
tell
me
that
i
had
married
her
if
caldigate
had
ever
allowed
a
shade
of
doubt
to
cross
his
mind
as
to
his
son
story
dick
shand
further
story
removed
it
the
picture
of
the
life
which
was
led
at
ahalala
and
nobble
was
painted
for
him
clearly
so
that
he
could
see
or
fancy
that
he
saw
what
the
condition
of
things
had
been
and
this
increased
faith
trickled
through
to
others
bromley
who
had
always
believed
believed
more
firmly
than
before
and
sent
tidings
of
his
belief
to
and
thence
to
babington
holt
the
farmer
became
more
than
ever
energetic
and
in
a
loud
voice
at
a
cambridge
market
ordinary
declared
the
done
to
caldigate
and
his
young
wife
it
had
been
said
over
and
over
again
at
the
trial
that
dick
shand
evidence
was
the
one
thing
wanted
and
here
was
dick
shand
to
give
his
evidence
then
the
belief
gained
ground
in
cambridge
and
with
the
belief
there
arose
a
feeling
as
to
the
egregious
wrong
which
was
being
done
but
the
boltons
were
still
assured
none
of
them
had
as
yet
given
any
sign
of
yielding
robert
bolton
knew
very
well
that
shand
was
at
folking
but
had
not
asked
to
see
him
he
and
seely
were
on
different
sides
and
could
not
discuss
the
matter
but
their
ideas
were
the
same
it
was
incredible
to
robert
that
dick
shand
should
appear
just
at
this
moment
unless
as
part
of
an
arranged
plan
he
could
not
read
the
whole
plot
but
was
sure
that
there
was
a
plot
it
was
held
in
his
mind
as
a
certain
fact
that
john
caldigate
would
not
have
paid
away
that
large
sum
of
money
had
he
not
thought
that
by
doing
so
he
was
buying
off
crinkett
and
the
other
witnesses
of
course
there
had
been
a
marriage
in
australia
and
therefore
the
arrival
of
dick
shand
was
to
him
only
a
lifting
of
the
curtain
for
another
act
of
the
play
an
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
get
caldigate
out
of
prison
which
attempt
it
was
his
duty
to
oppose
caldigate
had
he
thought
deceived
and
inflicted
a
terrible
stain
on
his
family
and
therefore
caldigate
was
an
enemy
upon
whom
it
behoved
him
to
be
revenged
this
feeling
was
the
stronger
in
his
bosom
because
caldigate
had
been
brought
into
the
family
by
him
but
when
dick
shand
called
upon
him
at
his
office
he
would
not
deny
himself
have
been
told
by
some
people
that
as
i
am
here
in
the
neighbourhood
i
ought
to
come
and
speak
to
you
said
dick
the
people
had
been
in
the
first
instance
ralph
holt
the
farmer
but
dick
had
discussed
the
matter
with
bromley
and
bromley
had
thought
that
shand
story
should
be
told
direct
to
hester
brother
you
have
anything
to
say
shand
i
am
ready
to
hear
it
this
about
a
marriage
at
ahalala
between
john
caldigate
and
smith
is
a
plan
mr
bolton
jury
did
not
seem
to
think
so
mr
shand
was
here
then
to
let
them
know
the
truth
robert
bolton
raised
his
eyebrows
marvelling
at
the
simplicity
of
the
man
who
could
fancy
that
his
single
word
would
be
able
to
weigh
down
the
weight
of
evidence
which
had
sufficed
to
persuade
twelve
men
and
such
a
judge
as
judge
bramber
was
with
caldigate
all
the
time
and
i
sure
of
what
saying
the
two
were
on
speaking
terms
when
they
were
said
to
be
married
course
shand
as
you
have
come
to
me
i
will
hear
what
you
may
have
to
say
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
the
man
has
been
tried
and
found
guilty
can
let
him
out
again
if
he
innocent
queen
can
pardon
him
no
doubt
but
even
the
queen
can
not
quash
the
conviction
the
evidence
was
as
clear
as
noonday
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
the
public
were
all
in
one
mind
i
was
here
then
said
dick
shand
with
perfect
confidence
robert
bolton
could
only
look
at
him
and
raise
his
eyebrows
he
could
not
tell
him
to
his
face
that
no
unprejudiced
person
would
believe
the
evidence
of
such
a
witness
your
said
dick
i
supposed
you
be
glad
to
know
that
he
was
innocent
ca
go
into
that
question
shand
as
i
believe
him
to
have
been
guilty
of
as
wicked
a
crime
as
any
man
can
well
commit
i
can
not
concern
myself
in
asking
for
a
pardon
for
him
my
own
impression
is
that
he
should
have
been
sent
to
penal
servitude
george
exclaimed
dick
tell
you
that
it
is
all
a
lie
from
beginning
to
end
fear
we
can
not
do
any
good
by
talking
about
it
mr
shand
george
dick
hitched
up
his
yellow
trousers
as
though
he
were
preparing
for
a
fight
he
wore
his
yellow
trousers
without
braces
and
in
all
moments
of
energy
hitched
them
up
you
please
i
will
say
good
morning
to
you
george
when
i
tell
you
that
i
was
there
all
the
time
and
that
caldigate
never
spoke
to
the
woman
or
so
much
as
saw
her
all
that
month
and
that
therefore
your
own
sister
is
in
honest
truth
wife
you
wo
listen
to
me
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
lying
shand
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
my
office
george
i
wish
i
had
you
bolton
out
at
ahalala
where
there
are
not
quite
so
many
policemen
as
there
are
here
at
cambridge
shall
have
to
send
for
one
of
them
if
you
do
go
away
mr
shand
a
man
who
even
for
the
sake
of
his
own
sister
wo
hear
the
truth
just
because
he
hates
his
sister
husband
what
have
i
got
to
get
by
lying
i
can
not
tell
bolton
as
he
said
this
prepared
himself
for
a
sudden
attack
but
shand
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
he
would
injure
the
cause
in
which
he
was
interested
as
well
as
himself
by
any
exhibition
of
violence
and
therefore
left
the
office
said
bromley
when
all
this
was
told
him
is
not
a
cruel
man
nor
dishonest
nor
even
untrue
to
his
sister
but
having
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
caldigate
had
been
married
in
australia
he
can
not
release
himself
from
the
idea
and
as
he
thinks
so
he
feels
it
to
be
his
duty
to
keep
his
sister
and
caldigate
apart
why
does
he
not
believe
me
demanded
dick
answer
to
that
i
can
only
say
that
i
do
believe
you
then
there
came
a
request
from
babington
that
dick
shand
would
go
over
to
them
there
for
a
day
at
babington
opinion
was
divided
aunt
polly
and
her
eldest
daughter
and
with
them
smirkie
still
thought
that
john
caldigate
was
a
wicked
bigamist
but
the
squire
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
gradually
gone
over
to
the
other
side
the
squire
had
never
been
hot
against
the
offender
having
been
one
of
those
who
fancied
that
a
marriage
at
a
very
place
such
as
ahalala
did
not
signify
much
and
now
when
he
heard
of
dick
shand
return
and
proffered
evidence
he
declared
that
dick
shand
having
been
born
a
gentleman
though
he
had
been
ever
so
much
a
sinner
and
ever
so
much
a
drunkard
was
entitled
to
credence
before
a
host
of
crinketts
but
with
aunt
polly
and
julia
there
remained
the
sense
of
the
old
injury
robbing
shand
of
all
his
attributes
of
birth
and
endowing
even
crinkett
with
truth
then
there
had
been
a
few
words
and
the
squire
had
asserted
himself
and
insisted
upon
asking
shand
to
babington
you
ever
see
such
trousers
said
julia
to
her
mother
would
not
believe
him
on
his
oath
not
said
smirkie
who
of
the
three
was
by
far
the
most
vehement
in
his
adherence
to
the
verdict
man
is
a
notorious
drunkard
and
he
has
that
look
of
wildness
which
bad
characters
always
bring
with
them
from
the
colonies
did
drink
anything
but
water
at
lunch
said
one
of
the
younger
girls
never
do
when
they
eating
said
smirkie
for
the
great
teetotal
triumph
had
not
as
yet
been
made
known
to
the
family
at
babington
regular
drunkards
take
it
at
all
times
by
themselves
in
their
own
rooms
he
has
delirium
tremens
in
his
face
i
do
believe
a
word
that
he
says
certainly
does
wear
the
oddest
trousers
i
ever
saw
said
aunt
polly
at
the
same
time
dick
himself
was
closeted
with
the
squire
and
was
convincing
him
that
there
had
been
no
australian
marriage
at
all
did
jump
over
a
broomstick
or
anything
of
that
kind
asked
the
squire
intending
to
be
jocose
did
nothing
at
all
said
dick
who
had
worked
himself
up
to
a
state
of
great
earnestness
would
as
much
as
look
at
her
at
that
time
and
then
to
come
home
here
and
find
him
in
prison
because
he
had
married
her
how
any
one
should
have
believed
it
did
believe
it
the
women
here
believe
it
now
as
you
perceive
an
awful
shame
babington
think
of
her
babington
harder
on
her
even
than
him
for
he
was
well
fond
of
the
woman
once
is
hard
but
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
get
him
out
i
write
to
our
member
sir
george
supports
the
government
and
i
get
him
to
see
the
secretary
it
is
hard
upon
a
young
fellow
just
when
he
has
got
married
and
come
into
a
nice
property
her
mr
babington
bad
indeed
i
see
sir
george
myself
the
odd
part
of
it
is
the
boltons
are
all
against
him
old
bolton
never
quite
liked
the
marriage
and
his
wife
is
a
regular
tartar
thus
the
squire
was
gained
and
the
younger
daughter
but
smirkie
was
as
obdurate
as
ever
something
of
his
ground
was
cut
from
under
his
feet
when
dick
new
and
peculiar
habits
were
observed
at
dinner
smirkie
did
indeed
cling
to
his
doctrine
that
your
real
drunkard
never
drinks
at
his
meals
but
when
dick
on
being
pressed
in
regard
to
wine
apologised
by
saying
that
he
had
become
so
used
to
tea
in
the
colonies
as
not
to
be
able
to
take
anything
else
at
dinner
the
peculiarity
was
discussed
till
he
was
driven
to
own
that
he
had
drank
nothing
stronger
for
the
last
two
years
then
it
became
plain
that
delirium
tremens
was
not
written
on
his
face
quite
so
plainly
as
smirkie
had
at
first
thought
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
his
trousers
to
condemn
him
but
smirkie
was
still
confident
do
think
you
can
go
beyond
the
verdict
he
said
may
be
a
pardon
of
course
though
i
shall
never
believe
it
till
i
see
it
but
though
there
were
twenty
pardons
she
ought
not
to
go
back
to
him
the
pardon
does
not
alter
the
crime
and
whether
he
was
married
in
australia
or
whether
he
was
not
she
ought
to
think
that
he
was
because
the
jury
has
said
so
if
she
had
any
feeling
of
feminine
propriety
she
would
shut
herself
up
and
call
herself
miss
bolton
do
agree
with
you
in
the
least
said
the
squire
i
hope
i
may
live
to
see
a
dozen
little
caldigates
running
about
on
that
lawn
and
there
were
a
few
words
upstairs
on
the
subject
between
smirkie
and
his
wife
for
even
smirkie
and
aunt
polly
at
last
submitted
themselves
to
dick
energy
then
if
he
comes
out
said
the
wife
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
this
was
said
in
a
voice
which
did
not
admit
of
contradiction
and
was
evidence
at
any
rate
that
dick
visit
to
babington
had
been
successful
in
spite
of
the
yellow
trousers
chapter
lii
the
fortunes
of
bagwax
an
altogether
new
idea
had
occurred
to
bagwax
as
he
sat
in
his
office
after
his
interview
with
sir
john
joram
and
it
was
an
idea
of
such
a
nature
that
he
thought
that
he
saw
his
way
quite
plain
to
a
complete
manifestation
of
the
innocence
of
caldigate
to
a
certainty
of
a
pardon
and
to
an
immediate
end
of
the
whole
complication
by
a
sudden
glance
at
the
evidence
his
eye
had
caught
an
object
which
in
all
his
glances
he
had
never
before
observed
then
at
once
he
went
to
work
and
finding
that
certain
little
marks
were
distinctly
legible
he
became
on
a
sudden
violently
hot
so
that
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
here
was
the
whole
thing
disclosed
at
once
disclosed
to
all
the
world
if
he
chose
to
disclose
it
but
if
he
did
so
then
there
could
not
be
any
need
for
that
journey
to
sydney
which
sir
john
still
thought
to
be
expedient
and
this
thing
which
he
had
now
seen
was
not
one
within
his
own
branch
of
work
was
not
a
matter
with
which
he
was
bound
to
be
conversant
somebody
else
ought
to
have
found
it
out
his
own
knowledge
was
purely
accidental
there
would
be
no
disgrace
to
him
in
not
finding
it
out
but
he
had
found
it
out
bagwax
was
a
man
who
in
his
official
zeal
and
official
capacity
had
exercised
his
intellect
far
beyond
the
matters
to
which
he
was
bound
to
apply
himself
in
the
mere
performance
of
his
duties
were
his
business
and
had
he
given
all
his
mind
to
postmarks
he
would
have
sufficiently
carried
out
that
great
doctrine
of
doing
the
duty
which
england
expects
from
every
man
but
he
had
travelled
beyond
postmarks
and
had
looked
into
many
things
among
other
matters
he
had
looked
into
penny
stamps
twopenny
stamps
and
other
stamps
in
phraseology
there
is
sometimes
a
confusion
because
the
affixed
effigy
of
her
majesty
head
which
represents
the
postage
paid
is
called
a
stamp
and
the
postmarks
or
impressions
indicating
the
names
of
towns
are
also
called
stamps
those
postmarks
or
impressions
had
been
the
work
of
bagwax
life
but
his
zeal
his
joy
in
his
office
and
the
general
energy
of
his
disposition
had
opened
up
to
him
also
all
the
mysteries
of
the
queen
heads
that
stamp
that
effigy
that
twopenny
which
by
its
presence
on
the
corner
of
the
envelope
purported
to
have
been
the
price
of
conveying
the
letter
from
sydney
to
nobble
on
may
had
certainly
been
manufactured
and
sent
out
to
the
colony
since
that
date
there
are
signs
invisible
to
ordinary
eyes
which
are
plain
as
the
sun
at
noonday
to
the
initiated
it
is
so
in
all
arts
in
all
sciences
bagwax
was
at
once
sure
of
his
fact
to
his
instructed
gaze
the
little
receipt
for
twopence
was
as
clearly
dated
as
though
the
figures
were
written
on
it
and
yet
he
had
never
looked
at
it
before
in
the
absorbing
interest
which
the
postmark
had
created
that
fraudulent
postmark
as
it
certainly
was
he
had
never
condescended
to
examine
the
but
now
he
saw
and
was
certain
if
it
was
so
and
he
had
no
doubt
then
would
caldigate
surely
be
released
it
is
hoped
that
the
reader
will
follow
the
mind
of
bagwax
which
was
in
this
matter
very
clear
this
envelope
had
been
brought
up
at
the
trial
as
evidence
that
on
a
certain
day
caldigate
had
written
to
the
woman
as
his
wife
and
had
sent
the
letter
through
the
for
such
sending
the
was
necessary
the
had
certainly
been
put
on
when
the
envelope
was
prepared
for
its
intended
purpose
but
if
it
could
be
proved
by
the
stamp
itself
that
it
had
not
been
in
existence
on
the
date
impressed
on
the
envelope
then
the
fraud
would
be
quite
apparent
and
if
there
had
been
such
fraud
then
would
the
testimony
of
all
those
four
witnesses
be
crushed
into
arrant
perjury
they
had
produced
the
fraudulent
document
and
by
it
would
be
thoroughly
condemned
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
a
journey
to
sydney
as
it
all
became
clear
to
his
mind
he
thumped
his
table
partly
in
triumph
partly
in
despair
the
matter
with
you
now
said
curlydown
it
was
a
quarter
past
four
and
curlydown
had
not
completed
his
daily
inspections
had
bagwax
been
doing
his
proper
share
of
work
curlydown
would
have
already
washed
his
hands
and
changed
his
coat
and
have
been
ready
to
start
for
the
train
as
it
was
he
had
an
hour
of
labour
before
him
and
would
be
unable
to
count
the
plums
upon
his
wall
as
was
usual
with
him
before
dinner
becomes
more
wonderful
every
day
said
bagwax
solemnly
almost
awfully
is
very
wonderful
to
me
that
a
man
should
be
able
to
sit
so
many
hours
looking
at
one
dirty
bit
of
paper
moment
that
i
pass
with
that
envelope
before
my
eyes
i
see
the
innocent
husband
in
jail
and
the
poor
afflicted
wife
weeping
in
her
solitude
be
going
on
to
the
stage
bagwax
before
this
is
done
have
sometimes
thought
that
it
was
the
career
for
which
i
was
best
adapted
but
as
to
the
envelope
the
facts
are
now
certain
new
facts
asked
curlydown
but
he
asked
the
question
in
a
jeering
tone
not
at
all
as
though
desiring
confidence
or
offering
sympathy
replied
bagwax
slowly
facts
are
certainly
new
and
most
convincing
but
as
you
have
not
given
attention
to
the
particular
branch
concerned
there
can
be
no
good
in
my
mentioning
them
you
would
not
understand
me
it
was
thus
that
he
revenged
himself
on
curlydown
then
there
was
again
silence
between
them
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
curlydown
was
hurrying
through
his
work
and
bagwax
was
meditating
whether
it
was
certainly
his
duty
to
make
known
the
facts
as
to
the
are
so
unkind
said
bagwax
at
last
in
a
tone
of
injured
friendship
burning
to
tell
his
new
discovery
have
got
it
all
your
way
said
curlydown
without
lifting
his
head
then
as
you
said
just
now
i
do
understand
tell
you
everything
if
you
only
be
a
little
less
hard
curlydown
was
envious
he
had
of
course
been
told
of
the
civil
things
which
sir
john
joram
had
said
and
though
he
did
not
quite
believe
all
he
was
convinced
that
bagwax
was
supposed
to
have
distinguished
himself
if
there
was
anything
to
be
known
he
would
like
to
know
it
nor
was
he
naturally
quarrelsome
bagwax
was
his
old
friend
do
mean
to
be
hard
he
said
course
one
does
feel
oneself
fretted
when
one
has
been
obliged
to
miss
two
trains
i
lend
a
hand
said
bagwax
does
signify
now
i
ca
catch
anything
before
the
one
does
expect
to
get
away
a
little
earlier
than
that
on
a
saturday
what
is
it
that
you
found
out
you
really
care
to
know
course
i
do
if
it
anything
in
earnest
i
took
quite
as
much
interest
as
you
in
the
matter
when
we
were
down
at
cambridge
see
that
bagwax
stretched
out
the
envelope
or
rather
the
photograph
of
the
envelope
for
it
was
no
more
but
the
queen
head
with
all
its
obliterating
smudges
and
all
its
marks
and
peculiarities
were
to
be
seen
quite
as
plainly
as
on
the
original
which
was
tied
up
carefully
among
the
archives
of
the
trial
see
that
curlydown
took
his
glass
and
looked
at
the
document
and
declared
that
he
saw
the
very
plainly
it
does
not
tell
you
anything
particular
very
particular
at
the
first
glance
said
curlydown
gazing
through
the
glass
with
all
his
eyes
again
see
that
they
obliterate
out
there
with
a
kind
of
star
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
bunch
of
hair
at
the
back
of
the
head
is
quite
like
our
bunch
of
hair
the
same
taken
from
the
same
die
said
bagwax
little
holes
for
dividing
the
stamps
are
bigger
is
that
what
the
d
is
it
are
letters
at
every
corner
said
bagwax
of
course
said
curlydown
you
read
those
letters
curlydown
owned
that
he
never
had
quite
understood
what
those
letters
meant
two
p
in
the
two
bottom
corners
tell
me
that
that
stamp
was
printed
before
it
was
all
explained
to
me
not
long
ago
now
the
postmark
is
dated
there
was
an
air
of
triumph
about
bagwax
as
he
said
this
which
almost
drove
curlydown
back
to
hostility
but
he
checked
himself
merely
shaking
his
head
and
continued
to
look
at
the
stamp
do
you
think
of
that
asked
bagwax
have
to
prove
it
course
i
should
but
the
stamps
are
made
here
and
are
sent
out
to
the
colony
i
shall
see
smithers
at
the
on
monday
of
course
smithers
was
a
gentleman
concerned
in
the
manufacture
of
stamps
i
know
my
facts
i
am
as
well
aware
of
the
meaning
of
those
letters
as
though
i
had
made
my
own
peculiar
duty
now
what
ought
i
to
do
would
have
to
go
i
suppose
a
foot
yet
it
ought
to
be
found
out
how
that
date
got
there
and
curlydown
put
his
finger
upon
the
impression
may
a
doubt
about
it
i
should
do
a
deal
of
good
by
going
if
give
me
proper
authority
to
overhaul
everything
in
the
office
out
there
they
had
the
letter
stamped
fraudulently
fraudulently
curlydown
perhaps
if
i
stayed
at
home
to
give
evidence
they
send
you
to
sydney
to
find
all
that
out
there
was
a
courtesy
in
this
suggestion
which
induced
curlydown
to
ask
his
junior
to
come
down
and
take
at
apricot
villa
bagwax
was
delighted
for
his
heart
had
been
sore
at
the
coolness
which
had
grown
up
between
him
and
the
man
under
whose
wing
he
had
worked
for
so
many
years
he
had
been
devoted
to
curlydown
till
growing
ambition
had
taught
him
to
think
himself
able
to
strike
out
a
line
for
himself
curlydown
had
two
daughters
of
whom
the
younger
jemima
had
found
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
bagwax
but
since
the
jealousy
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
men
he
had
never
seen
jemima
nor
tasted
the
fruits
of
curlydown
garden
curlydown
who
approved
of
bagwax
had
been
angry
and
jemima
herself
had
become
sullen
and
unloving
to
her
father
on
that
very
morning
curlydown
had
declared
that
she
hated
quarrels
like
poison
do
i
mamma
said
jemima
breaking
her
silence
emphatically
that
bagwax
is
anything
to
anybody
does
look
like
something
said
curlydown
whispering
to
his
friend
in
the
railway
carriage
they
were
sitting
opposite
to
each
other
with
their
knees
together
and
were
of
course
discussing
the
envelope
is
everything
when
they
were
making
up
their
case
in
australia
and
when
the
woman
brought
out
the
cover
with
his
writing
upon
it
with
the
very
name
caldigate
written
by
himself
crinkett
contented
with
that
so
they
put
their
heads
together
and
said
that
if
the
letter
could
be
got
to
look
like
a
posted
letter
a
letter
sent
regularly
by
the
post
that
would
be
real
evidence
the
idea
bad
has
ever
been
considered
better
evidence
than
postmarks
said
curlydown
with
authority
was
a
good
idea
then
they
had
to
get
a
they
little
knew
how
they
might
put
their
foot
into
it
there
and
they
got
hold
of
some
young
man
at
the
who
knew
how
to
fix
a
with
a
past
date
how
these
things
become
clear
when
one
looks
at
them
long
enough
one
has
to
have
an
eye
in
one
head
said
bagwax
as
modestly
as
he
could
at
such
a
moment
fellow
has
to
have
his
wits
about
him
before
he
can
do
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in
any
line
you
tell
sir
john
everything
at
once
would
you
curlydown
raised
his
hat
and
scratched
his
head
first
you
know
duty
first
said
bagwax
a
man
own
line
yes
said
curlydown
else
ought
to
have
found
that
out
that
not
it
stamps
and
taxes
very
hard
that
a
man
should
have
to
cut
the
nose
off
his
own
face
by
knowing
more
than
he
need
know
duty
said
bagwax
as
he
opened
the
and
jumped
out
on
to
the
platform
when
he
got
up
to
the
cottage
curlydovvn
assured
him
that
it
was
quite
a
cure
for
sore
eyes
to
see
him
sophia
the
elder
of
the
two
daughters
at
home
told
him
that
he
was
a
false
truant
and
jemima
surmised
that
the
great
attractions
of
the
london
season
had
prevented
him
from
coming
down
to
enfield
is
that
indeed
he
said
am
always
delighted
in
running
down
but
the
caldigate
affair
has
been
so
important
mean
the
trial
said
curlydown
the
man
has
been
in
prison
ever
so
long
most
unjustly
it
so
really
asked
jemima
the
poor
young
bride
so
much
of
a
bride
said
sophia
got
one
i
know
papa
says
you
to
go
out
to
botany
bay
said
jemima
be
years
and
years
before
you
are
back
again
then
he
explained
it
was
not
botany
bay
and
he
would
be
back
in
six
months
and
after
all
he
was
going
at
all
i
declare
if
papa
is
down
the
walk
already
said
jemima
looking
out
of
the
window
do
think
i
shall
go
at
all
said
bagwax
in
a
melancholy
tone
as
he
went
to
wash
his
hands
the
dinner
was
very
pleasant
and
as
curlydown
and
his
guest
drank
their
bottle
of
port
together
at
the
open
window
it
was
definitely
settled
that
bagwax
should
reveal
the
mystery
of
the
to
sir
john
joram
at
once
should
have
it
like
a
lump
of
lead
on
my
conscience
all
the
time
i
was
on
the
deep
said
bagwax
solemnly
is
conscience
to
be
sure
said
curlydown
do
think
that
i
given
to
be
afraid
said
bagwax
ocean
if
i
know
myself
would
have
no
terrors
for
me
not
if
i
was
doing
my
duty
but
i
should
hear
the
ship
sides
cracking
with
every
blast
if
that
secret
were
lodged
within
my
breast
another
glass
of
port
old
boy
bagwax
did
take
another
glass
finishing
the
bottle
and
continued
to
those
smiling
shores
farewell
sydney
and
all
her
charms
farewell
to
her
orange
groves
her
blue
mountains
and
her
rich
a
drop
of
whitewash
to
wind
up
and
then
we
join
the
ladies
curlydown
was
a
strictly
hospitable
man
and
in
his
own
house
would
not
appear
to
take
amiss
anything
his
guest
might
say
but
when
bagwax
became
too
poetical
over
his
wine
curlydown
waxed
impatient
bagwax
took
his
drop
of
whitewash
and
then
hurried
on
to
the
lawn
to
join
jemima
you
really
are
not
going
to
those
distant
parts
said
bagwax
with
all
that
melancholy
which
wine
and
love
combined
with
sorrow
can
produce
dream
is
over
am
so
glad
should
you
be
glad
why
should
a
resolve
which
it
almost
breaks
my
heart
to
make
be
a
source
of
joy
to
you
course
you
would
have
nothing
to
regret
at
leaving
mr
bagwax
much
if
i
were
going
for
ever
no
i
could
never
do
that
unless
i
were
to
take
some
dear
one
with
me
but
as
i
said
that
dream
is
over
it
has
ever
been
my
desire
to
see
foreign
climes
and
the
chance
so
seldom
comes
in
a
man
way
been
to
ostend
i
know
mr
bagwax
yes
and
to
boulogne
said
bagwax
proudly
the
desire
of
travel
grows
with
the
thing
it
feeds
on
i
long
to
overcome
great
distances
to
feel
that
i
have
put
illimitable
space
behind
me
to
set
my
foot
on
shores
divided
from
these
by
the
thickness
of
all
the
earth
would
give
me
a
sense
of
grandeur
which
i
which
which
would
be
magnificent
suppose
that
is
natural
in
a
man
some
men
said
bagwax
not
liking
to
be
told
that
his
heroic
instincts
were
shared
by
all
his
brethren
women
of
course
think
of
the
dangers
suppose
you
were
to
be
cast
away
matter
with
a
father
of
a
family
of
course
it
would
be
different
but
a
lone
man
should
never
think
of
such
things
jemima
shook
her
head
and
walked
silently
by
his
side
i
had
some
dear
one
who
cared
for
me
i
suppose
it
would
be
different
with
me
do
know
said
jemima
like
to
amuse
themselves
sometimes
but
it
does
often
go
very
deep
always
go
deep
with
me
said
bagwax
panted
for
that
journey
to
the
antipodes
panted
for
it
now
that
it
is
over
perhaps
some
day
i
may
tell
you
under
what
circumstances
it
has
been
relinquished
in
the
meantime
my
mind
passes
to
other
things
or
perhaps
i
should
say
my
heart
jemima
then
bagwax
stopped
on
the
path
on
bagwax
papa
will
be
looking
at
you
he
said
you
recompense
me
by
your
love
for
what
i
have
lost
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
she
recompensed
him
and
he
was
happy
the
future
father
and
sat
and
discussed
their
joint
affairs
for
an
hour
after
the
ladies
had
retired
as
to
jemima
and
his
love
bagwax
was
allowed
to
be
altogether
triumphant
curlydown
kissed
him
and
he
kissed
sophia
that
was
in
public
what
passed
between
him
and
jemima
no
human
eye
saw
the
old
clerk
took
the
younger
one
to
his
heart
and
declared
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
girl
choice
always
known
that
you
were
steady
he
said
that
what
i
look
to
she
has
had
her
admirers
and
perhaps
might
have
looked
higher
but
what
rank
or
money
if
a
man
fond
of
pleasure
but
when
that
was
settled
they
returned
again
to
the
caldigate
envelope
curlydown
was
not
quite
so
sure
as
to
that
question
of
duty
the
proposed
journey
to
sydney
with
a
pound
allowed
for
expenses
and
the
traveller
salary
going
on
all
the
time
would
put
a
nice
sum
of
into
bagwax
pocket
would
be
less
than
two
hundred
towards
furnishing
my
boy
said
curlydown
want
it
and
as
for
the
delay
what
six
months
girls
like
to
have
a
little
time
to
boast
about
it
but
bagwax
had
made
up
his
mind
and
nothing
would
shake
him
they
let
me
go
out
all
the
same
to
set
matters
right
of
course
take
the
job
i
should
think
it
a
duty
and
would
bear
the
delay
as
well
as
i
could
if
jemima
thought
it
right
i
sure
she
would
complain
but
since
i
saw
that
letter
on
that
stamp
my
conscience
has
told
me
that
i
must
reveal
it
all
it
might
be
me
as
was
in
prison
and
jemima
who
was
told
that
i
had
a
wife
in
australia
since
i
looked
at
it
in
that
light
i
been
more
determined
than
ever
to
go
to
sir
john
chambers
on
monday
curlydown
i
am
very
glad
you
asked
me
down
to
the
cottage
more
glad
than
anything
at
eleven
by
the
last
train
bagwax
returned
to
town
and
spent
the
night
with
mingled
dreams
in
which
sydney
jemima
and
the
envelope
were
all
in
their
turns
eluding
him
and
all
in
their
turns
within
his
grasp
chapter
liii
sir
john
backs
his
opinion
well
bagwax
i
glad
that
it
only
one
envelope
this
time
this
was
said
by
sir
john
joram
to
the
honest
and
energetic
clerk
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
the
september
when
the
lawyer
would
have
been
among
the
partridges
down
in
suffolk
but
for
the
vicissitudes
of
john
caldigate
case
it
was
hard
upon
sir
john
and
went
something
against
the
grain
with
him
he
was
past
the
time
of
life
at
which
men
are
enthusiastic
as
to
the
wrongs
of
others
as
was
bagwax
and
had
in
truth
much
less
to
gain
from
the
cause
or
to
expect
than
bagwax
he
thought
that
the
pertinacity
of
bagwax
and
the
coming
of
dick
shand
at
the
moment
of
his
holidays
were
circumstances
which
justified
the
use
of
a
little
internal
strong
language
such
as
he
had
occasionally
used
externally
before
he
had
become
in
fact
he
had
damned
dick
shand
and
bagwax
and
in
doing
so
had
considered
that
jones
his
clerk
was
internal
wish
he
had
gone
to
sydney
a
month
ago
he
said
to
jones
but
when
jones
suggested
that
bagwax
might
be
sent
to
sydney
without
further
trouble
sir
john
conscience
pricked
him
not
to
be
able
to
shoot
a
suffolk
partridge
on
the
of
september
was
very
cruel
but
to
be
detained
wrongfully
in
cambridge
jail
was
worse
and
he
was
of
opinion
that
such
cruelty
had
been
inflicted
on
caldigate
on
the
saturday
dick
shand
had
been
with
him
he
had
remained
in
town
on
the
monday
and
tuesday
by
agreement
with
seely
early
on
the
tuesday
intimation
was
given
to
him
that
bagwax
would
come
on
the
wednesday
with
further
evidence
with
evidence
which
should
be
positively
conclusive
bagwax
had
in
the
meantime
been
with
his
friend
smithers
at
the
and
was
now
fully
prepared
by
the
help
of
smithers
he
had
arrived
at
the
fact
that
the
had
certainly
been
fabricated
in
some
months
after
the
date
imprinted
on
the
cover
of
the
letter
to
which
it
was
affixed
sir
john
only
one
this
time
we
need
move
anything
all
the
chaos
had
been
restored
to
its
normal
place
and
looked
as
though
it
had
never
been
moved
since
it
was
collected
we
can
prove
that
this
did
not
exist
before
the
january
the
deposition
said
bagwax
who
by
his
frequent
intercourse
with
jones
had
become
almost
as
good
as
a
lawyer
himself
least
it
is
a
deposition
of
course
because
it
not
sworn
statement
of
what
can
be
proved
on
oath
that
sir
john
it
smithers
smithers
has
been
at
the
work
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
knew
it
just
as
well
as
he
from
the
first
because
i
attend
to
these
sort
of
things
but
i
thought
it
best
to
go
to
the
right
john
will
want
to
hear
it
from
the
i
said
to
myself
and
therefore
i
went
to
smithers
smithers
is
perhaps
a
little
conceited
but
his
word
is
gospel
in
a
matter
of
smithers
is
gospel
then
sir
john
read
the
statement
and
though
he
may
not
have
taken
it
for
gospel
still
to
him
it
was
credible
seems
clear
he
said
as
the
running
stream
said
bagwax
should
like
to
have
all
that
gang
up
for
perjury
mr
bagwax
should
i
sir
john
so
should
i
when
i
think
of
that
poor
dear
lady
and
her
infant
babe
without
a
name
and
that
young
father
torn
from
his
paternal
acres
and
cast
into
a
vile
prison
my
blood
boils
within
my
veins
and
all
my
passion
to
see
foreign
climes
fades
into
the
distance
foreign
climes
now
mr
bagwax
suppose
not
sir
john
said
the
hero
mournfully
if
this
be
true
gospel
sir
john
gospel
they
might
send
me
out
to
set
that
office
to
rights
things
must
be
very
wrong
when
they
could
get
hold
of
a
and
use
it
in
that
way
there
must
be
one
of
the
gang
in
the
office
bribe
did
it
i
should
say
could
find
it
out
sir
john
let
me
alone
for
that
you
could
say
that
you
have
found
me
in
this
matter
could
you
sir
john
bagwax
was
truly
happy
in
the
love
of
jemima
curlydown
but
the
idea
of
earning
two
hundred
pounds
for
furniture
and
of
seeing
distant
climes
at
the
same
time
had
taken
a
strong
hold
of
his
imagination
am
afraid
i
should
have
no
voice
in
the
matter
unless
with
the
view
of
getting
evidence
we
got
that
have
we
sir
john
think
so
sir
john
duty
said
bagwax
almost
sobbing
through
his
triumph
it
mr
bagwax
sir
john
too
had
given
up
his
partridges
for
a
day
or
two
that
gentleman
will
now
be
restored
to
his
wife
is
for
me
to
say
as
you
and
i
have
been
engaged
on
the
same
side
to
be
told
that
he
had
been
on
the
same
side
with
the
late
was
almost
compensation
to
bagwax
for
the
loss
of
his
journey
you
and
i
have
been
on
the
same
side
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
think
that
he
ought
to
be
released
the
matter
remains
with
the
secretary
of
state
who
will
probably
be
guided
by
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
stern
man
sir
john
bagwax
but
as
conscientious
a
man
as
you
be
able
to
put
your
hand
upon
the
young
wife
with
her
nameless
baby
move
him
at
all
but
were
he
moved
by
such
consideration
he
would
be
so
far
unfit
for
his
office
is
divine
said
bagwax
therefore
unfit
to
be
used
by
a
merely
human
judge
you
know
i
suppose
that
richard
shand
has
come
home
he
has
and
was
with
me
a
day
or
two
since
he
say
anything
bagwax
was
not
rejoiced
at
dick
opportune
return
he
thoroughly
wished
that
caldigate
should
be
liberated
but
he
wished
himself
to
monopolise
the
glory
of
the
work
says
a
great
deal
he
has
sworn
that
there
was
no
such
marriage
at
the
time
named
he
and
caldigate
were
living
together
then
and
for
some
weeks
afterwards
and
the
woman
was
never
near
them
during
the
time
think
of
his
coming
just
now
will
be
a
great
help
bagwax
but
it
would
be
enough
alone
he
might
possibly
tell
an
untruth
on
the
other
side
as
it
were
that
but
this
little
here
ca
be
untrue
sir
john
no
that
ca
be
said
bagwax
comforted
the
dated
impression
ca
lie
either
the
envelope
is
what
do
it
after
all
hope
so
you
and
jones
will
prepare
the
statement
for
the
secretary
of
state
and
i
will
send
it
myself
with
that
bagwax
took
his
leave
and
remained
closeted
with
jones
for
much
of
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
moment
sir
john
was
alone
he
wrote
an
almost
angry
note
to
his
friend
honybun
in
conjunction
with
whom
and
another
member
of
parliament
he
had
the
shooting
in
suffolk
honybun
who
was
also
a
lawyer
though
less
successful
than
his
friend
was
a
much
better
shot
and
was
already
taking
the
cream
off
the
milk
of
the
shooting
can
not
conceive
he
said
at
the
end
of
his
letter
after
all
my
experience
i
should
have
put
myself
so
much
out
of
my
way
to
serve
a
client
a
man
should
do
what
he
paid
to
do
and
what
it
is
presumed
that
he
will
do
and
nothing
more
but
here
i
have
been
instigated
by
an
insane
ambition
to
emulate
the
zeal
of
a
fellow
who
is
absolutely
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
good
of
a
stranger
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
could
not
leave
london
till
the
friday
on
the
thursday
morning
he
put
all
the
details
together
and
himself
drew
out
a
paper
for
the
perusal
of
the
secretary
of
state
as
he
looked
at
the
matter
all
round
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
question
was
so
clear
that
even
judge
bramber
could
not
hesitate
the
evidence
of
dick
shand
was
quite
conclusive
if
credible
it
was
open
of
course
to
strong
doubt
in
that
it
could
not
be
sifted
by
alone
it
certainly
would
not
have
sufficed
to
extort
a
pardon
from
any
secretary
of
state
as
any
secretary
of
state
would
have
been
alive
to
the
fact
that
dick
might
have
been
suborned
dick
life
had
not
been
such
that
his
single
word
would
have
been
regarded
as
certainly
true
but
in
corroboration
it
was
worth
much
and
then
if
the
secretary
or
the
judge
could
be
got
to
go
into
that
very
complicated
question
of
the
dated
stamp
it
would
sir
john
thought
become
evident
to
him
that
the
impression
had
not
been
made
at
the
time
indicated
this
had
gradually
been
borne
in
upon
sir
john
mind
till
he
was
almost
as
confident
in
his
facts
as
bagwax
himself
but
this
operation
had
required
much
time
and
much
attention
would
the
secretary
or
would
the
judge
clear
his
table
and
give
himself
time
to
inspect
and
to
measure
two
or
three
hundred
postmarks
the
date
of
the
fabrication
of
the
would
of
course
require
to
be
verified
by
official
report
but
if
the
facts
as
stated
by
bagwax
were
thus
confirmed
then
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
envelope
would
be
put
beyond
doubt
it
would
be
so
manifest
that
this
morsel
of
evidence
had
been
falsely
concocted
that
no
man
let
his
prepossessions
be
what
they
might
could
doubt
it
judge
bramber
would
no
doubt
begin
to
sift
the
case
with
a
strong
bias
in
favour
of
the
jury
it
was
for
a
jury
to
ascertain
the
facts
and
in
this
case
the
jury
had
done
so
in
his
opinion
in
judge
opinion
as
the
judge
had
often
declared
it
a
judge
should
not
be
required
to
determine
facts
a
new
trial
were
that
possible
would
be
the
proper
remedy
if
remedy
were
wanted
but
as
that
was
impossible
he
would
be
driven
to
investigate
such
new
evidence
as
was
brought
before
him
and
to
pronounce
what
would
in
truth
be
another
verdict
all
this
was
clear
to
sir
john
and
he
told
himself
that
even
judge
bramber
would
not
be
able
to
deny
that
false
evidence
had
been
submitted
to
the
jury
sir
john
as
he
occupied
his
mind
with
the
matter
on
the
thursday
morning
did
wake
himself
up
to
some
generous
energy
on
his
behalf
so
that
in
sending
the
written
statements
of
the
case
to
the
home
secretary
he
himself
wrote
a
short
but
note
it
is
quite
manifest
he
said
a
certain
amount
of
false
and
fraudulent
circumstantial
evidence
has
been
brought
into
court
by
the
witnesses
who
proved
the
alleged
marriage
and
as
direct
evidence
has
now
come
to
hand
on
the
other
side
which
is
very
clear
and
as
far
as
we
know
trustworthy
i
feel
myself
justified
in
demanding
her
pardon
for
my
client
on
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
birdseye
lodge
near
ipswich
and
was
quite
enthusiastic
on
the
matter
with
his
friend
honybun
never
knew
bramber
go
beyond
a
jury
in
my
life
said
honybun
have
to
do
it
now
they
ca
keep
him
in
prison
when
they
find
that
the
chief
witness
was
manifestly
perjured
the
woman
swore
on
her
oath
that
the
letter
reached
her
by
post
in
may
it
certainly
did
not
do
so
the
cover
as
we
see
it
has
been
fabricated
since
that
date
never
thought
the
cover
went
for
much
said
honybun
very
little
for
nothing
at
all
perhaps
till
proved
to
be
fraudulent
if
they
had
left
the
letter
alone
their
case
would
have
been
strong
enough
for
a
conviction
as
it
was
they
were
fools
enough
to
go
into
a
business
of
this
sort
but
they
have
done
so
and
as
they
have
been
found
out
the
falsehood
which
has
been
detected
covers
every
word
of
their
spoken
evidence
with
suspicion
it
will
be
like
losing
so
much
of
his
heart
blood
but
the
old
fellow
will
have
to
give
way
never
gave
way
in
his
life
make
him
begin
bet
you
a
pony
he
do
take
the
bet
said
the
late
but
as
he
did
so
he
looked
round
to
see
that
not
even
a
gamekeeper
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
on
that
friday
bagwax
was
in
a
very
melancholy
state
of
mind
at
his
office
in
spite
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
prospects
with
miss
curlydown
just
come
back
to
my
old
work
he
said
to
his
future
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
this
was
all
as
it
should
be
and
would
have
been
regarded
a
day
or
two
ago
by
curlydown
as
simple
justice
there
had
been
quite
enough
of
that
pottering
over
an
old
envelope
to
the
manifest
inconvenience
of
himself
and
others
but
now
the
matter
was
altered
his
was
a
paternal
and
an
affectionate
heart
and
he
saw
very
plainly
the
pecuniary
advantage
of
a
journey
to
sydney
and
he
knew
too
that
in
official
life
as
well
as
elsewhere
to
those
who
have
much
more
is
given
now
that
bagwax
was
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
son
he
wished
bagwax
to
rise
in
the
world
would
give
it
up
said
he
what
would
you
do
stick
to
it
like
wax
till
they
did
something
for
me
nothing
to
stick
to
take
it
for
granted
i
was
going
at
once
to
sydney
i
get
my
outfit
and
by
george
i
take
my
place
told
sir
john
i
was
going
and
he
said
it
was
necessary
as
bagwax
told
his
sad
tale
he
almost
wept
would
mind
that
i
have
it
out
of
them
somehow
why
is
he
to
have
all
the
pay
no
doubt
it
been
hundreds
to
him
and
you
done
the
work
and
got
nothing
i
asked
him
to
get
me
sent
he
said
he
no
power
not
now
all
so
plain
he
turned
his
face
down
towards
the
desk
to
hide
the
tear
that
now
was
in
truth
running
down
his
face
duty
he
said
looking
up
again
england
expects
d
n
it
who
going
to
whimper
when
i
lay
my
head
on
my
pillow
at
night
and
think
that
i
i
thomas
bagwax
have
restored
that
nameless
one
to
her
babe
and
her
lord
i
shall
sleep
even
though
that
pillow
be
no
better
than
a
hard
bolster
will
look
after
that
said
the
father
laughing
still
i
would
give
it
up
never
give
a
chance
up
they
come
so
seldom
tell
you
what
i
should
do
i
should
apply
to
the
secretary
for
leave
to
go
to
sydney
at
once
my
own
expense
said
bagwax
horrified
not
but
that
you
might
have
an
opportunity
of
investigating
all
this
for
the
public
service
it
get
referred
round
in
some
way
to
the
secretary
of
state
who
ca
but
say
all
that
you
done
when
it
gets
out
of
a
man
own
office
he
do
so
much
mind
doing
a
little
job
it
sounds
and
then
if
they
do
do
anything
for
you
you
get
a
grievance
next
to
a
sum
of
money
down
a
grievance
is
the
best
thing
you
can
have
a
man
who
can
stick
to
a
grievance
year
after
year
will
always
make
money
of
it
at
last
on
the
saturday
bagwax
went
down
to
apricot
lodge
having
been
invited
to
stay
with
his
beloved
till
the
monday
in
the
smiles
of
his
beloved
he
did
find
much
consolation
especially
as
it
had
already
been
assured
to
him
that
sixty
pounds
would
be
settled
on
jemima
on
and
from
her
and
then
they
made
very
much
of
him
do
love
me
tom
do
you
said
jemima
they
were
sitting
on
behind
the
grotto
and
bagwax
answered
by
pressing
the
loved
one
waist
than
going
to
sydney
tom
do
you
is
so
very
different
said
bagwax
which
was
true
you
do
like
me
better
than
anything
else
in
all
the
world
however
different
i
will
never
stand
at
the
altar
with
you
and
she
moved
her
perhaps
an
inch
away
the
way
of
loving
of
course
i
do
why
do
you
grieve
when
you
got
what
you
like
best
do
understand
jemima
what
a
spirit
of
adventure
means
think
i
do
or
i
should
be
going
to
marry
you
that
quite
as
great
an
adventure
as
a
journey
to
sydney
you
ought
to
be
very
glad
to
get
off
now
you
going
to
settle
down
as
a
married
man
what
two
hundred
pounds
would
be
jemima
in
the
way
of
furniture
papa
putting
in
i
know
i
hate
all
that
hankering
after
filthy
lucre
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
wanting
to
go
so
far
away
just
when
you
engaged
you
would
care
about
leaving
me
i
suppose
the
least
should
always
be
thinking
of
you
you
would
but
suppose
i
was
thinking
of
you
suppose
i
took
to
thinking
of
somebody
else
how
would
it
be
then
would
do
that
jemima
ought
to
know
when
you
well
off
tom
by
this
time
he
had
recovered
the
inch
and
perhaps
a
little
more
ought
to
feel
that
you
plenty
to
console
you
i
do
duty
duty
england
expects
that
every
man
your
idea
of
consolation
is
it
and
away
went
the
half
a
yard
believe
in
duty
do
you
jemima
a
husband
duty
to
his
wife
i
do
and
in
a
young
man
duty
to
his
sweetheart
in
a
father
to
his
children
as
may
be
said
she
getting
up
and
walking
away
into
the
he
of
course
accompanied
her
and
before
they
got
to
the
house
had
promised
her
not
to
sigh
for
the
delights
of
sydney
nor
for
the
perils
of
adventure
any
more
chapter
liv
judge
bramber
a
secretary
of
state
who
has
to
look
after
the
police
and
the
magistrates
to
answer
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
and
occasionally
to
make
a
telling
speech
in
defence
of
his
colleagues
and
in
addition
to
this
is
expected
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
practical
court
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases
must
have
something
to
do
to
have
to
decide
whether
or
no
some
poor
wretch
shall
be
hanged
when
in
spite
of
the
clearest
evidence
humanitarian
petitions
by
the
dozen
overwhelm
him
with
claims
for
mercy
must
be
a
terrible
responsibility
your
majesty
i
think
we
wo
hang
him
i
think
we
send
him
to
penal
servitude
for
life
if
your
majesty
pleases
that
is
so
easy
and
would
be
so
pleasant
why
should
any
one
grumble
at
so
right
royal
a
decision
but
there
are
the
newspapers
always
so
prone
to
complain
and
the
secretary
has
to
acknowledge
that
he
must
be
strong
enough
to
hang
his
culprits
in
spite
of
petitions
or
else
he
must
give
up
that
office
but
when
the
evidence
is
not
clear
the
case
is
twice
more
difficult
the
jury
have
found
their
verdict
and
the
law
intends
that
the
verdict
of
a
jury
shall
be
conclusive
when
a
man
has
been
declared
to
be
guilty
by
twelve
of
his
countrymen
he
is
guilty
let
the
facts
have
been
what
they
may
and
let
the
twelve
have
been
ever
so
much
in
error
majesty
however
can
pardon
guilt
and
hence
arises
some
awkward
remedy
for
the
mistakes
of
jurymen
but
an
unassisted
majesty
can
not
itself
investigate
all
things
is
not
in
fact
in
this
country
supposed
to
perform
any
duties
of
that
sort
a
secretary
of
state
is
invested
with
the
privilege
of
what
is
called
mercy
it
is
justice
rather
that
is
wanted
if
bagwax
were
in
the
right
about
that
envelope
and
the
reader
will
by
this
time
think
that
he
was
right
and
if
dick
shand
had
sworn
truly
then
certainly
our
friend
john
caldigate
was
not
in
want
of
mercy
it
was
instant
justice
that
he
required
with
such
compensation
as
might
come
to
him
from
the
indignant
sympathy
of
all
good
men
i
remember
to
have
seen
a
man
at
bermuda
whose
fate
was
peculiar
he
was
sleek
fat
and
apparently
comfortable
mixing
pills
when
i
saw
him
he
himself
a
convict
and
administering
to
the
wants
of
his
brother
convicts
he
remonstrated
with
me
on
the
hardness
of
his
position
i
did
do
it
or
i
did
he
said
was
because
they
thought
i
did
that
they
sent
me
here
and
if
i
did
what
right
had
they
to
keep
me
here
at
all
i
passed
on
in
silence
not
daring
to
argue
the
matter
with
the
man
in
face
of
the
warder
but
the
man
was
right
he
had
murdered
his
wife
so
at
least
the
jury
had
said
and
had
been
sentenced
to
be
hanged
he
had
taken
the
poor
woman
into
a
little
island
and
while
she
was
bathing
had
drowned
her
her
screams
had
been
heard
on
the
mainland
and
the
jury
had
found
the
evidence
sufficient
some
newspaper
had
thought
the
reverse
and
had
mooted
the
question
was
not
the
distance
too
great
for
such
screams
to
have
been
heard
or
at
any
rate
understood
so
the
man
was
again
brought
to
trial
in
the
court
of
the
home
office
and
was
not
pardoned
but
sent
to
grow
fat
and
make
pills
at
bermuda
he
had
or
he
had
not
murdered
his
wife
if
he
did
the
deed
he
should
have
been
hanged
and
if
not
he
should
not
have
been
forced
to
make
extorted
pills
what
was
a
secretary
of
state
to
do
in
such
a
case
no
doubt
he
believed
that
the
wretch
had
murdered
his
wife
no
doubt
the
judge
believed
it
all
the
world
believed
it
but
the
newspaper
was
probably
right
in
saying
that
the
evidence
was
hardly
conclusive
probably
right
because
it
produced
its
desired
effect
if
the
argument
had
been
successfully
used
with
the
jury
the
jury
would
have
acquitted
the
man
then
surely
the
secretary
of
state
should
have
sent
him
out
as
though
acquitted
and
not
daring
to
hang
him
should
have
treated
him
as
innocent
another
trial
was
in
truth
demanded
and
so
it
was
in
caldigate
case
the
secretary
of
state
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
after
a
remarkable
speech
in
which
he
vindicated
his
ministry
from
the
attacks
of
all
europe
did
read
all
the
papers
and
took
home
to
himself
the
great
bagwaxian
theory
he
mastered
evidence
and
managed
to
master
something
also
as
to
dick
character
he
quite
understood
the
argument
as
to
the
which
went
further
with
him
than
the
other
arguments
and
he
understood
the
perplexity
of
his
own
position
if
bagwax
was
right
not
a
moment
should
be
lost
in
releasing
the
man
to
think
of
pardon
to
mention
pardon
would
be
an
insult
instant
justice
with
infinite
regrets
that
the
injuries
inflicted
admitted
of
no
compensation
that
and
that
only
was
impressively
demanded
how
grossly
would
that
man
have
been
how
cruelly
would
that
woman
have
been
injured
but
then
again
if
bagwax
was
wrong
if
the
cunning
fraud
had
been
concocted
over
here
and
not
in
sydney
if
the
plot
had
been
made
not
to
incarcerate
an
innocent
man
but
to
liberate
a
guilty
man
then
how
unfit
would
he
show
himself
for
his
position
were
he
to
be
taken
in
by
such
guile
what
crime
could
be
worse
than
that
committed
by
caldigate
against
the
young
lady
he
had
betrayed
if
caldigate
were
guilty
upon
the
whole
he
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
trust
to
the
jury
but
comforted
himself
by
the
reflection
that
he
could
for
a
while
transfer
the
responsibility
it
would
perhaps
be
expedient
to
transfer
it
altogether
so
he
sent
all
the
papers
on
to
judge
bramber
judge
bramber
was
a
great
man
never
popular
he
had
been
wise
enough
to
disregard
popularity
he
had
forced
himself
into
practice
in
opposition
to
the
attorneys
by
industry
and
perspicuity
he
had
attended
exclusively
to
his
profession
never
having
attempted
to
set
his
foot
on
the
quicker
of
political
life
it
was
said
of
him
that
no
one
knew
whether
he
called
himself
liberal
or
conservative
at
he
was
put
upon
the
bench
simply
because
he
was
supposed
to
possess
a
judicial
mind
here
he
amply
justified
that
opinion
but
not
without
the
sneer
and
of
many
he
was
now
seventy
and
it
was
declared
that
years
had
had
no
effect
on
him
he
was
supposed
to
be
absolutely
merciless
as
hard
as
a
nether
millstone
a
judge
who
could
put
on
the
black
cap
without
a
feeling
of
inward
disgust
but
it
may
be
surmised
that
they
who
said
so
knew
nothing
of
him
for
he
was
a
man
not
apt
to
betray
the
secrets
of
his
inner
life
he
was
noted
for
his
reverence
for
a
jury
and
for
his
silence
on
the
bench
the
older
he
grew
the
shorter
became
his
charges
nor
were
there
wanting
those
who
declared
that
his
conduct
in
this
respect
was
intended
as
a
reproach
to
some
who
are
desirous
of
adorning
the
bench
by
their
eloquence
to
sit
there
listening
to
everything
and
subordinating
himself
to
others
till
his
interposition
was
necessary
was
his
idea
of
a
judge
duty
but
when
the
law
had
declared
itself
he
was
always
strong
in
supporting
the
law
a
man
condemned
for
murder
ought
to
be
hanged
so
thought
judge
bramber
and
not
released
in
accordance
with
the
phantasy
of
philanthropists
such
were
the
requirements
of
the
law
if
the
law
were
cruel
let
the
legislators
look
to
that
he
was
once
heard
to
confess
that
the
position
of
a
judge
who
had
condemned
an
innocent
man
might
be
hard
to
bear
but
he
added
that
a
country
would
be
unfortunate
which
did
not
possess
judges
capable
of
bearing
even
that
sorrow
in
his
heart
he
disapproved
of
the
attribute
of
mercy
as
belonging
to
the
crown
it
was
opposed
to
his
idea
of
english
law
and
apt
to
do
harm
rather
than
good
he
had
been
quite
convinced
of
caldigate
guilt
not
only
by
the
direct
evidence
but
by
the
concurrent
circumstances
to
his
thinking
it
was
not
in
human
nature
that
a
man
should
pay
such
a
sum
as
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
such
people
as
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
a
sum
of
money
which
was
not
due
either
legally
or
morally
except
with
an
improper
object
i
have
said
that
he
was
a
great
man
but
he
did
not
rise
to
any
appreciation
of
the
motives
which
had
unquestionably
operated
with
caldigate
had
caldigate
been
quite
assured
when
he
paid
the
money
that
his
enemies
would
remain
and
bear
witness
against
him
still
he
would
have
paid
it
in
that
matter
he
had
endeavoured
to
act
as
he
would
have
acted
had
the
circumstances
of
the
mining
transaction
been
made
known
to
him
when
no
threat
was
hanging
over
his
head
but
all
that
judge
bramber
did
not
understand
he
understood
however
quite
clearly
that
under
no
circumstances
should
money
have
been
paid
by
an
accused
person
to
witnesses
while
that
person
guilt
and
innocence
were
in
question
in
his
he
had
simply
told
the
jury
to
consider
the
matter
but
he
had
so
spoken
the
word
as
to
make
the
jury
fully
perceive
what
had
been
the
result
of
his
own
consideration
and
then
caldigate
and
the
woman
had
lived
together
and
a
distinct
and
repeated
promise
of
marriage
had
been
acknowledged
it
was
acknowledged
that
the
man
had
given
his
name
to
the
woman
so
far
as
himself
to
write
it
whatever
might
be
the
facts
as
to
the
postmark
and
the
words
caldigate
had
been
written
by
the
man
now
in
prison
four
persons
had
given
direct
evidence
and
in
opposition
to
them
there
had
been
nothing
till
dick
shand
had
come
no
voice
had
been
brought
forward
to
throw
even
a
doubt
upon
the
marriage
that
two
false
witnesses
should
adhere
well
together
in
a
story
was
uncommon
that
three
should
do
so
most
rare
with
four
it
would
be
almost
a
miracle
but
these
four
had
adhered
they
were
people
probably
of
bad
character
whose
lives
had
perhaps
been
lawless
but
if
so
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
prove
them
false
if
they
were
false
thus
judge
bramber
when
he
passed
sentence
on
caldigate
had
not
in
the
least
doubted
that
the
verdict
was
a
true
verdict
and
now
the
case
was
sent
to
him
for
reconsideration
he
hated
such
reconsiderations
he
first
read
sir
john
joram
letter
and
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
unfit
to
have
come
from
any
one
calling
himself
a
lawyer
there
was
an
enthusiasm
about
it
altogether
beneath
a
great
advocate
certainly
beneath
any
forensic
advocate
employed
otherwise
than
in
addressing
a
jury
he
judge
bramber
had
never
himself
talked
of
a
verdict
even
from
a
jury
he
had
only
endeavoured
to
win
it
but
that
a
man
who
had
been
who
had
been
the
head
of
the
bar
should
thus
write
to
a
secretary
of
state
was
to
him
disgusting
to
his
thinking
a
great
lawyer
even
a
good
lawyer
would
be
incapable
of
enthusiasm
as
to
any
case
in
which
he
was
employed
the
ignorant
childish
world
outside
would
indulge
in
zeal
and
hot
feelings
but
for
an
advocate
to
do
so
was
to
show
that
he
was
no
lawyer
that
he
was
no
better
than
the
outside
world
even
spoken
eloquence
was
in
his
mind
almost
beneath
a
lawyer
studied
eloquence
certainly
was
so
but
such
written
words
as
these
disgusted
him
and
then
he
came
across
allusions
to
the
condition
of
the
poor
lady
at
folking
what
could
the
condition
of
the
lady
at
folking
have
to
do
with
the
matter
though
the
poor
lady
at
folking
should
die
in
her
sorrow
that
could
not
alter
the
facts
as
they
had
occurred
in
australia
it
was
not
for
him
or
for
the
secretary
of
state
to
endeavour
to
make
things
pleasant
all
round
here
in
england
it
had
been
the
jury
duty
to
find
out
whether
that
crime
had
been
committed
and
his
duty
to
see
that
all
due
facilities
were
given
to
the
jury
it
had
been
sir
john
joram
duty
to
make
out
what
best
case
he
could
for
his
client
and
then
to
rest
contented
had
all
things
been
as
they
should
be
the
secretary
of
state
would
have
had
no
duty
at
all
in
the
matter
it
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
judge
bramber
applied
himself
to
the
consideration
of
the
case
no
juster
man
ever
lived
and
yet
in
his
mind
there
was
a
bias
against
the
prisoner
nevertheless
he
went
to
his
work
with
great
patience
and
a
resolve
to
sift
everything
that
was
to
be
sifted
the
secretary
of
state
had
done
no
more
than
his
required
duty
in
sending
the
case
to
him
and
he
would
now
do
his
he
took
the
as
it
came
in
the
papers
in
order
that
the
two
bagwaxian
theories
each
founded
on
the
same
small
document
might
be
expounded
one
consecutively
after
the
other
dick
shand
and
his
deposition
were
produced
first
the
judge
declared
to
himself
that
dick
single
oath
which
could
not
now
be
tested
by
amounted
to
nothing
he
had
been
a
drunkard
and
a
pauper
had
descended
to
the
lowest
occupation
which
the
country
afforded
and
had
more
than
once
nearly
died
from
delirium
tremens
he
had
then
come
home
penniless
and
had
produced
his
story
if
such
evidence
could
avail
to
rescue
a
prisoner
from
his
sentence
and
to
upset
a
verdict
what
verdict
or
what
sentence
could
stand
poor
sworn
testimony
in
judge
bramber
mind
told
rather
against
caldigate
than
for
him
then
came
the
postmarks
as
to
which
the
bagwaxian
theory
was
quite
distinct
from
that
as
to
the
here
the
judge
found
the
facts
to
be
somewhat
complicated
and
mazy
it
was
long
before
he
could
understand
the
full
purport
of
the
argument
used
and
even
at
last
he
hardly
understood
the
whole
of
it
but
he
could
see
nothing
in
it
to
justify
him
in
upsetting
the
verdict
nothing
even
to
convince
him
that
the
envelope
had
been
fraudulently
handled
there
was
no
evidence
that
such
a
dated
stamp
had
not
been
in
use
at
sydney
on
the
day
named
copies
from
the
records
kept
daily
at
sydney
photographed
copies
should
have
been
submitted
before
that
argument
had
been
used
but
when
it
came
to
the
then
he
told
himself
very
quickly
that
the
envelope
had
been
fraudulently
handled
the
evidence
as
to
the
date
of
the
manufacture
of
the
stamp
was
conclusive
it
could
not
have
served
to
pay
the
postage
on
a
letter
from
sydney
to
nobble
in
may
seeing
that
it
had
not
then
been
in
existence
and
thus
any
necessity
there
might
otherwise
have
been
for
further
inquiry
as
to
the
postmarks
was
dissipated
the
envelope
was
a
declared
fraud
and
the
fraud
required
no
further
proof
that
morsel
of
evidence
had
been
fabricated
and
laid
at
any
rate
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
last
trial
open
to
a
charge
of
perjury
so
resolving
judge
bramber
pushed
the
papers
away
from
him
and
began
to
think
the
case
over
in
his
mind
there
was
certainly
something
in
the
entire
case
as
it
now
stood
to
excuse
sir
john
that
was
the
first
line
which
his
thoughts
took
an
advocate
having
clearly
seen
into
a
morsel
of
evidence
on
the
side
opposed
to
him
and
having
proved
to
himself
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
was
maliciously
false
must
be
held
to
be
justified
in
holding
more
than
a
mere
advocate
conviction
as
to
the
innocence
of
his
client
sir
john
had
of
course
felt
that
a
foul
plot
had
been
contrived
a
foul
plot
no
doubt
had
been
contrived
had
the
discovery
taken
place
before
the
case
had
been
submitted
to
the
jury
the
detection
of
that
plot
would
doubtless
have
saved
the
prisoner
whether
guilty
or
innocent
so
much
judge
bramber
admitted
but
should
it
necessarily
serve
to
save
him
now
before
a
jury
it
would
have
saved
him
whether
guilty
or
innocent
but
the
law
had
got
hold
of
him
and
had
made
him
guilty
and
the
law
need
not
now
subject
itself
to
the
normal
human
weakness
of
a
jury
the
case
was
now
in
his
hands
in
his
and
those
of
the
secretary
and
there
need
be
no
weakness
if
the
man
was
innocent
in
god
name
let
him
go
though
as
the
judge
observed
to
himself
he
had
deserved
all
he
had
got
for
his
folly
and
vice
but
this
discovered
plot
by
no
means
proved
the
man
innocence
it
only
proved
the
determination
of
certain
persons
to
secure
his
conviction
whether
by
foul
means
or
fair
then
he
recapitulated
to
himself
various
cases
in
which
he
had
known
false
evidence
to
have
been
added
to
true
with
the
object
of
convincing
a
jury
as
to
a
real
fact
it
might
well
be
that
this
gang
of
ruffians
for
it
was
manifest
that
there
had
been
such
a
gang
finding
the
envelope
addressed
by
the
man
to
his
wife
had
fraudulently
and
as
foolishly
as
fraudulently
endeavoured
to
bolster
up
their
case
by
the
and
the
postmark
looking
back
at
all
the
facts
remembering
that
fatal
twenty
thousand
pounds
remembering
that
though
the
postmarks
were
forged
on
that
envelope
the
writing
was
true
remembering
the
acknowledged
promise
and
the
combined
testimony
of
the
four
persons
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
something
of
the
kind
had
been
done
in
this
case
if
it
were
so
though
he
would
fain
see
the
perpetrators
of
that
fraud
on
their
trial
for
perjury
their
fraud
in
no
way
diminished
caldigate
guilt
that
a
guilty
man
should
escape
out
of
the
hands
of
justice
by
any
fraud
was
wormwood
to
judge
bramber
caldigate
was
guilty
the
jury
had
found
him
so
could
he
take
upon
himself
to
say
that
the
finding
of
the
jury
was
wrong
because
the
prosecuting
party
had
concocted
a
fraud
which
had
not
been
found
out
before
the
verdict
was
given
sir
john
joram
whom
he
had
known
almost
as
a
boy
had
the
release
of
his
client
the
word
stuck
in
judge
bramber
throat
the
word
had
been
injudicious
the
more
he
thought
of
the
word
the
more
he
thought
that
the
verdict
had
been
a
true
verdict
in
spite
of
the
fraud
a
very
honest
man
was
judge
bramber
but
human
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
but
then
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
had
not
quite
done
so
taints
the
entire
evidence
with
perjury
sir
john
had
said
the
woman
evidence
was
absolutely
so
tainted
was
defiled
with
perjury
and
the
man
crinkett
had
been
so
near
the
woman
that
it
was
impossible
to
disconnect
them
who
had
concocted
the
fraud
the
woman
could
hardly
have
done
so
without
the
man
connivance
it
took
him
all
the
morning
to
think
the
matter
out
and
then
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
to
reverse
the
verdict
would
certainly
be
a
thorn
in
his
side
a
pernicious
thorn
but
one
which
if
necessary
he
would
endure
thorns
however
such
as
these
are
very
persuasive
at
last
he
determined
to
have
inquiry
made
as
to
the
woman
by
the
police
she
had
laid
herself
open
to
an
indictment
for
perjury
and
in
making
inquiry
on
that
head
something
further
might
probably
be
learned
chapter
lv
how
the
conspirators
throve
there
had
been
some
indiscretion
among
caldigate
friends
from
which
it
resulted
that
while
judge
bramber
was
considering
the
matter
and
before
the
police
intelligence
of
scotland
yard
even
had
stirred
itself
in
obedience
to
the
judge
orders
nearly
all
the
circumstances
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
judge
had
become
public
shand
knew
all
that
bagwax
had
done
bagwax
was
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
evidence
and
hester
down
at
folking
understood
perfectly
what
had
been
revealed
by
each
of
those
enthusiastic
allies
dick
as
we
know
had
been
staying
at
folking
and
had
made
his
presence
notable
throughout
the
county
he
had
succeeded
in
convincing
uncle
babington
and
had
been
judged
to
be
a
false
witness
by
all
the
boltons
in
that
there
had
perhaps
been
no
great
indiscretion
but
when
bagwax
opened
a
correspondence
with
john
caldigate
and
explained
to
her
at
great
length
all
the
circumstances
of
the
postmark
and
the
and
when
at
her
instance
he
got
a
day
holiday
and
rushed
down
to
folking
then
as
he
felt
himself
he
was
doing
that
of
which
sir
john
joram
and
jones
would
not
approve
but
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
why
should
he
restrain
himself
when
he
had
lost
all
hope
of
his
journey
to
sydney
when
the
prospect
of
that
delight
no
longer
illumined
his
days
why
should
he
not
enjoy
the
other
delight
of
communicating
his
tidings
his
own
discoveries
to
the
afflicted
lady
unless
he
did
so
it
would
appear
to
her
that
joram
had
done
it
all
and
there
would
be
no
reward
absolutely
none
so
he
told
his
tale
at
first
by
letter
and
then
with
his
own
natural
eloquence
caldigate
the
postmarks
are
difficult
it
takes
a
lifetime
of
study
to
understand
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
postmarks
to
me
it
is
a
b
c
of
course
when
i
had
spent
a
week
or
two
looking
into
it
i
was
sure
that
impression
had
never
been
made
in
the
way
of
business
bagwax
was
sitting
out
on
the
lawn
at
folking
and
the
bereaved
wife
dressed
in
black
was
near
him
holding
in
her
hand
one
of
the
photographed
copies
of
the
envelope
a
b
c
to
me
but
i
do
wonder
you
should
see
it
think
i
do
see
a
good
deal
said
hester
any
babe
may
understand
that
said
bagwax
pressing
forward
and
putting
his
forefinger
on
the
obliteration
of
the
see
the
date
in
the
postmark
know
the
date
very
well
had
it
proved
that
on
the
date
given
there
this
identical
had
not
yet
been
manufactured
the
secretary
of
state
get
over
that
i
defy
him
do
they
release
him
at
once
then
you
and
me
caldigate
i
think
it
judge
bramber
ca
want
to
injure
an
innocent
man
what
i
heard
sir
john
say
i
fancy
he
does
like
to
have
the
verdict
upset
but
they
must
do
it
i
defy
them
to
get
over
that
and
again
he
tapped
the
then
he
told
the
story
of
his
love
for
jemima
and
of
his
engagement
of
course
he
was
praised
and
petted
as
indeed
he
deserved
and
thus
though
the
house
at
folking
was
a
sad
house
he
enjoyed
himself
as
men
do
when
much
is
made
of
them
by
pretty
women
but
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
every
detail
of
the
story
became
known
to
the
public
and
was
quite
common
down
at
cambridge
the
old
squire
was
urgent
with
seely
asking
why
it
was
that
when
those
things
were
known
an
instant
order
had
not
come
from
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
liberation
of
his
son
seely
had
not
been
altogether
pleased
at
the
way
in
which
sir
john
had
gone
to
work
and
was
still
convinced
of
the
guilt
of
his
own
client
his
answer
was
therefore
unsatisfactory
and
the
old
squire
proclaimed
his
intention
of
proceeding
himself
to
london
and
demanding
an
interview
with
the
secretary
of
state
then
the
cambridge
newspapers
took
up
the
subject
generally
in
the
caldigate
interest
and
from
thence
the
matter
was
transferred
to
the
metropolitan
columns
which
with
one
exception
were
strong
in
favour
of
such
a
reversal
of
the
verdict
as
could
be
effected
by
a
pardon
from
the
queen
the
one
exception
was
very
pellucid
very
unanswerable
and
very
it
might
have
been
written
by
judge
bramber
himself
but
that
judge
bramber
would
sooner
have
cut
his
hand
off
than
have
defiled
it
by
making
public
aught
that
had
come
before
him
judicially
or
officially
but
all
judge
bramber
arguments
were
there
set
forth
dick
wished
his
father
at
once
to
proceed
against
the
paper
for
libel
because
the
paper
said
that
his
word
could
not
be
taken
for
much
the
postmark
theory
was
exposed
to
derision
there
was
no
doubt
much
in
the
but
not
enough
to
upset
the
overwhelming
weight
of
evidence
by
which
the
verdict
had
been
obtained
and
so
the
case
became
really
public
and
the
newspapers
were
bought
and
read
with
the
avidity
which
marks
those
festive
periods
in
which
some
popular
criminal
is
being
discussed
at
every
much
of
this
had
occurred
before
the
intelligence
of
scotland
yard
had
been
set
to
work
in
obedience
to
judge
bramber
the
papers
had
been
a
day
or
two
in
the
home
office
and
three
or
four
days
in
the
hands
before
he
could
look
at
them
to
hester
and
the
old
squire
at
folking
the
incarceration
of
that
injured
darling
was
the
one
thing
in
all
the
world
which
now
required
attention
to
redress
that
terrible
grievance
judges
secretaries
thrones
and
parliaments
should
have
left
their
wonted
tracks
and
thought
of
nothing
till
it
had
been
accomplished
but
judge
bramber
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
was
never
hurried
and
at
the
home
office
a
delay
but
of
three
or
four
days
amounted
to
official
haste
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
all
that
bagwax
had
done
and
all
that
shand
had
said
were
known
to
the
public
at
large
before
the
intelligence
of
scotland
yard
was
at
work
before
anybody
had
as
yet
done
anything
among
the
public
were
euphemia
smith
and
crinkett
adamson
also
and
anna
young
the
other
witness
since
the
trial
this
confraternity
had
not
passed
an
altogether
fraternal
life
when
the
money
had
been
paid
the
woman
had
insisted
on
having
the
half
she
indeed
had
carried
the
cheque
for
the
amount
away
from
the
jericho
it
had
been
given
into
her
hands
and
those
of
crinkett
conjointly
and
she
had
secured
the
document
the
amount
was
payable
to
their
joint
order
and
each
had
felt
that
it
would
be
better
to
divide
the
spoil
in
peace
crinkett
had
taken
his
half
with
many
grumblings
because
he
had
in
truth
arranged
the
matter
and
hitherto
paid
the
expenses
then
the
woman
had
wished
to
start
at
once
for
australia
taking
the
other
female
with
her
but
to
this
crinkett
had
objected
they
would
certainly
he
said
be
arrested
for
breaking
their
bail
at
whatever
port
they
might
reach
and
why
should
they
go
seeing
that
the
money
had
been
paid
to
them
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
they
were
not
pledged
to
abandon
the
prosecution
most
unwillingly
the
woman
remained
but
did
so
fearing
lest
worse
evil
might
betide
her
then
there
had
arisen
quarrels
about
the
money
between
the
two
females
and
between
crinkett
and
adamson
it
was
in
vain
that
crinkett
showed
that
were
he
to
share
with
adamson
there
would
be
very
little
of
the
plunder
left
to
him
adamson
demanded
a
quarter
of
the
whole
short
of
a
quarter
of
the
expenses
declaring
that
were
it
not
paid
to
him
he
would
divulge
everything
to
the
police
the
woman
who
had
got
her
money
in
her
hand
and
who
was
in
truth
spending
it
very
quickly
would
give
back
nothing
for
expenses
unless
her
expenses
in
england
also
were
considered
nor
would
she
give
a
shilling
to
anna
young
beyond
an
allowance
of
a
week
till
as
she
said
they
were
both
back
in
the
colony
again
but
anna
young
did
not
wish
to
go
back
to
the
colony
and
so
they
quarrelled
till
the
trial
came
and
was
over
the
verdict
had
been
given
on
the
july
and
it
was
about
the
middle
of
september
when
the
newspapers
made
public
all
that
shand
and
bagwax
between
them
had
said
and
done
at
that
time
the
four
conspirators
were
still
in
england
the
two
men
were
living
a
wretched
life
in
london
and
the
women
were
probably
not
less
wretched
at
brighton
smith
when
she
learned
that
dick
shand
was
alive
and
in
england
immediately
understood
her
danger
understood
her
danger
but
did
not
at
all
measure
the
security
which
might
come
to
her
from
the
nature
of
character
she
would
have
flown
instantly
without
a
word
to
any
one
but
that
the
other
woman
watched
her
day
and
night
they
did
not
live
under
the
same
roof
nor
in
similar
style
euphemia
smith
wore
silk
and
endeavoured
to
make
the
best
of
what
female
charms
her
ill
mode
of
life
had
left
to
her
while
young
was
content
with
poor
apparel
and
poor
living
but
spent
her
time
in
keeping
guard
on
the
other
the
woman
in
silk
knew
that
were
she
to
leave
her
lodgings
for
half
a
day
without
the
knowledge
of
the
woman
in
calico
the
woman
in
calico
would
at
once
reveal
everything
to
the
police
but
when
she
understood
the
point
which
had
been
raised
and
made
as
to
the
postmark
which
she
did
understand
thoroughly
then
she
comprehended
also
her
own
jeopardy
and
hurried
up
to
london
to
see
crinkett
and
she
settled
matters
with
young
if
young
would
go
back
with
her
to
australia
everything
there
should
be
made
pleasant
terms
were
made
at
the
brighton
station
anna
young
was
to
receive
two
thousand
pounds
in
london
and
would
then
remain
as
companion
with
her
old
mistress
in
london
there
was
a
close
conference
at
first
between
the
two
principals
only
crinkett
thought
that
he
was
comparatively
safe
he
had
sworn
to
nothing
about
the
letter
and
though
he
himself
had
prepared
the
envelope
no
proof
of
his
handiwork
was
forthcoming
that
he
had
done
so
but
he
was
quite
ready
to
start
again
to
some
distant
portion
of
the
earth
surface
to
almost
any
distant
portion
of
the
surface
if
she
would
consent
to
a
joining
of
purses
who
is
to
keep
the
joint
purse
asked
smith
not
without
a
touch
of
grand
irony
of
course
said
crinkett
man
always
must
have
the
money
sooner
have
fourteen
years
for
perjury
like
the
claimant
said
smith
with
a
grand
resolve
that
come
what
might
she
would
stick
to
her
own
money
but
at
last
it
was
decided
adamson
would
not
stir
a
step
but
consented
to
remain
with
two
thousand
pounds
which
crinkett
was
compelled
to
pay
him
crinkett
handed
him
the
money
within
the
precincts
of
one
of
the
city
banks
not
an
hour
before
the
sailing
of
the
julius
vogel
from
the
london
docks
for
auckland
in
new
zealand
at
that
moment
both
the
women
were
on
board
the
julius
vogel
and
the
gang
was
so
far
safe
crinkett
was
there
in
time
and
they
were
carried
safely
down
the
river
new
zealand
had
been
chosen
because
there
they
would
be
further
from
their
persecutors
than
at
any
other
spot
they
could
reach
and
the
journey
would
occupy
long
and
they
were
pervaded
by
an
idea
that
as
they
had
been
hitherto
brought
in
question
as
to
no
crime
the
officers
of
justice
would
hardly
bring
them
back
from
so
great
a
distance
the
julius
vogel
touched
at
plymouth
on
her
outward
voyage
how
terribly
inconvenient
must
be
this
habit
of
touching
to
passengers
going
from
home
such
as
euphemia
smith
and
thomas
crinkett
and
the
wretched
vessel
which
had
made
a
quick
passage
round
from
the
thames
lay
two
days
and
two
nights
at
dartmouth
before
it
went
on
to
plymouth
our
friends
of
course
did
not
go
on
shore
our
friends
who
were
known
as
catley
and
his
two
widowed
sisters
salmon
and
york
kept
themselves
very
quiet
and
were
altogether
but
the
women
could
not
restrain
some
manifestation
of
their
impatience
why
did
not
the
vessel
start
why
were
they
to
be
delayed
then
the
captain
made
known
to
them
that
the
time
for
starting
had
not
yet
come
three
on
that
day
was
the
time
fixed
for
starting
as
the
slow
moments
wore
themselves
away
the
women
trembled
huddled
together
on
the
poop
of
the
vessel
while
crinkett
never
letting
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
stood
leaning
against
the
taffrail
looking
towards
the
port
gazing
across
the
waters
to
see
whether
anything
was
coming
towards
the
ship
which
might
bode
evil
to
his
journey
then
there
came
the
bustle
preparatory
to
starting
and
crinkett
thought
that
he
was
free
at
any
rate
for
that
journey
but
such
bustle
spreads
itself
over
many
minutes
quarter
of
an
hour
succeeded
quarter
of
an
hour
and
still
they
were
not
off
the
last
passenger
came
on
board
and
yet
they
were
not
off
then
crinkett
with
his
sharp
eyes
saw
another
boat
pushed
off
from
the
shore
and
heard
a
voice
declare
that
the
julius
vogel
had
received
a
signal
not
to
start
then
crinkett
knew
that
a
time
of
desperate
trouble
had
come
upon
him
and
he
bethought
himself
what
he
would
do
were
he
to
jump
overboard
they
would
simply
pick
him
up
nor
was
he
quite
sure
that
he
wished
to
die
the
money
which
he
had
kept
had
not
been
obtained
fraudulently
and
would
be
left
to
him
he
thought
after
that
term
of
imprisonment
which
it
might
be
his
fate
to
endure
but
then
again
it
might
be
that
no
such
fate
was
in
store
for
him
he
had
sworn
only
to
the
marriage
and
not
to
the
letter
it
might
still
be
possible
that
he
should
be
acquitted
while
the
woman
was
condemned
so
he
stood
perfectly
still
and
said
not
a
word
to
either
of
his
companions
as
to
the
boat
which
was
coming
he
could
soon
see
two
men
in
the
guise
of
policemen
and
another
who
was
certainly
a
policeman
though
not
in
that
guise
he
stood
there
very
quiet
and
determined
that
he
would
tell
his
own
name
and
those
of
the
two
women
at
the
first
question
that
was
asked
him
on
the
day
but
one
following
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
were
committed
in
london
to
take
their
trial
for
perjury
adamson
when
he
had
read
the
reports
in
the
newspapers
and
had
learned
that
the
had
been
detected
and
that
shand
was
at
home
also
looked
about
him
a
little
he
talked
over
the
matter
at
great
length
with
crinkett
but
he
did
not
tell
crinkett
all
his
own
ideas
some
of
them
he
did
make
known
to
crinkett
he
would
not
himself
go
to
the
colonies
with
crinkett
nor
would
he
let
crinkett
go
till
some
share
of
the
plunder
had
been
made
over
to
him
this
after
many
words
had
been
fixed
at
two
thousand
pounds
and
the
money
as
we
have
seen
had
been
paid
crinkett
had
been
careful
to
make
the
payment
at
as
late
a
moment
as
possible
he
had
paid
the
amount
very
much
to
his
own
regret
when
he
saw
that
boat
coming
because
he
was
quite
sure
that
adamson
would
at
once
have
denounced
him
to
the
police
had
he
not
done
so
adamson
might
denounce
him
in
spite
of
the
payment
but
the
payment
appeared
to
him
to
be
his
best
chance
when
he
saw
the
boat
coming
he
knew
that
he
had
simply
thrown
away
his
two
thousand
pounds
in
truth
he
had
simply
thrown
it
away
there
is
no
comfort
in
having
kept
one
word
honestly
when
one
would
fain
have
broken
it
dishonestly
adamson
with
the
large
roll
of
still
in
his
pocket
had
gone
at
once
to
scotland
yard
and
told
his
story
at
that
time
all
the
details
had
been
sent
by
the
judge
to
the
and
it
was
understood
that
a
great
inquiry
was
to
be
made
in
the
first
place
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
were
wanted
adamson
soon
made
his
bargain
he
could
tell
something
could
certainly
tell
where
crinkett
and
the
women
were
to
be
found
but
he
must
be
assured
that
any
little
peccadillo
of
which
he
himself
might
have
been
guilty
would
be
overlooked
the
peccadillo
on
his
part
had
been
very
small
but
he
must
be
assured
then
he
was
assured
and
told
the
police
at
once
that
they
could
stop
the
two
travellers
at
plymouth
and
of
course
he
told
more
than
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
no
real
marriage
he
had
been
induced
to
swear
that
there
had
been
a
marriage
because
he
had
regarded
the
promise
and
the
cohabitation
as
making
a
marriage
heaven
so
he
had
expressed
himself
and
so
excused
himself
but
now
his
eyes
had
been
opened
to
the
error
of
his
ways
and
he
was
free
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
committed
perjury
there
had
been
no
marriage
certainly
none
at
all
he
made
his
deposition
and
bound
himself
down
and
submitted
to
live
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
till
the
affair
should
be
settled
then
he
would
be
able
to
go
where
he
listed
with
two
thousand
pounds
in
his
pocket
he
was
a
humble
silent
and
generally
obedient
man
but
in
this
affair
he
had
managed
to
thrive
better
than
any
of
the
others
anna
young
was
afterwards
allowed
to
fill
the
same
position
but
she
failed
in
getting
any
of
the
money
while
the
women
were
in
london
together
and
as
they
were
starting
euphemia
smith
had
been
too
strong
for
her
companion
she
had
declared
that
she
would
not
pay
the
money
till
they
were
afloat
and
then
that
she
would
not
pay
it
till
they
had
left
plymouth
when
the
police
came
on
board
the
julius
vogel
anna
young
had
as
yet
received
nothing
chapter
lvi
the
boltons
are
very
firm
while
all
this
was
going
on
as
the
general
opinion
in
favour
of
caldigate
was
becoming
stronger
every
day
when
even
judge
bramber
had
begun
to
doubt
the
feeling
which
had
always
prevailed
at
puritan
grange
was
growing
in
intensity
and
converting
itself
from
a
conviction
into
a
passion
that
the
wicked
bigamist
had
falsely
and
fraudulently
robbed
her
of
her
daughter
was
a
religion
to
bolton
and
as
the
matter
had
proceeded
the
old
banker
had
become
ever
more
and
more
submissive
to
his
wife
feelings
all
the
cambridge
boltons
were
in
accord
on
this
subject
who
had
never
before
been
in
accord
on
any
subject
robert
bolton
who
understood
thoroughly
each
point
as
it
was
raised
on
behalf
of
caldigate
was
quite
sure
that
the
old
squire
was
spending
his
money
freely
his
own
money
and
his
son
with
the
view
of
getting
the
verdict
set
aside
what
was
so
clear
as
that
dick
shand
and
bagwax
and
probably
also
smithers
from
the
stamps
and
taxes
were
all
in
the
pay
of
old
caldigate
at
this
time
the
defection
of
adamson
was
not
known
to
him
but
he
did
know
that
a
strong
case
was
being
made
with
the
secretary
of
state
it
costs
me
all
i
have
in
the
world
i
will
expose
them
he
said
up
in
london
to
his
brother
william
the
london
barrister
the
barrister
was
not
quite
in
accord
with
the
other
boltons
he
also
had
been
disposed
to
think
that
dick
shand
and
bagwax
might
have
been
bribed
by
the
squire
it
was
at
any
rate
possible
and
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
paid
to
the
accusing
witnesses
had
always
stuck
in
his
throat
when
he
had
endeavoured
to
believe
that
caldigate
might
be
innocent
it
seemed
to
him
still
that
the
balance
of
evidence
was
against
the
man
who
had
taken
his
sister
away
from
her
home
but
he
was
willing
to
leave
that
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
to
the
judge
he
did
not
see
why
his
sister
should
not
have
her
husband
and
be
restored
to
the
world
if
judge
bramber
should
at
last
decide
that
so
it
ought
to
be
no
money
could
bribe
judge
bramber
no
undue
persuasion
could
weaken
him
if
that
rhadamanthus
should
at
last
say
that
the
verdict
had
been
a
wrong
verdict
then
for
pity
sake
for
love
sake
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
for
the
sake
of
all
boltons
present
and
to
come
let
the
man
be
considered
innocent
but
robert
bolton
was
more
intent
on
his
purpose
and
was
a
man
of
stronger
passion
perhaps
some
real
religious
scruple
told
him
that
a
woman
should
not
live
with
a
man
who
was
not
her
true
husband
let
any
judge
say
what
he
might
but
hatred
probably
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
religion
it
was
he
who
had
first
favoured
caldigate
claim
on
hester
hand
and
he
who
had
been
most
grievously
deceived
from
the
moment
in
which
the
conviction
had
come
upon
him
that
caldigate
had
even
promised
his
hand
in
marriage
to
euphemia
smith
he
had
become
caldigate
enemy
his
bitter
enemy
and
now
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
he
should
be
called
upon
again
to
receive
caldigate
as
his
caldigate
guilt
was
an
idea
fixed
in
his
mind
which
no
secretary
of
state
no
judge
bramber
no
brother
could
expel
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
hard
words
between
him
and
his
brother
are
wrong
said
william
wrong
you
can
not
say
that
you
believe
him
to
be
innocent
he
receives
the
queen
pardon
he
is
to
be
considered
as
innocent
though
you
should
know
him
to
have
been
guilty
yes
said
william
slowly
and
perhaps
indiscreetly
is
a
matter
in
which
a
man
guilt
or
innocence
must
be
held
to
depend
upon
what
persons
in
due
authority
have
declared
as
he
is
now
guilty
of
bigamy
in
consequence
of
the
verdict
even
though
he
should
never
have
committed
the
offence
so
should
he
be
presumed
to
be
innocent
when
that
verdict
has
been
set
aside
by
the
queen
pardon
on
the
advice
of
her
proper
officers
even
though
he
committed
the
offence
would
have
your
sister
live
with
a
man
who
has
another
wife
alive
it
comes
to
that
all
legal
purposes
he
would
have
no
other
wife
alive
children
would
be
illegitimate
you
are
decidedly
wrong
said
the
barrister
children
would
be
legitimate
even
at
this
moment
without
any
pardon
the
child
could
claim
and
would
enter
in
upon
his
inheritance
next
of
kin
would
claim
said
the
attorney
burden
of
proving
the
former
marriage
would
then
be
on
him
said
the
barrister
verdict
would
be
evidence
said
the
attorney
said
the
barrister
such
evidence
would
not
be
worth
a
straw
after
a
queen
pardon
given
on
the
advice
of
the
judge
who
had
tried
the
former
case
as
yet
we
know
not
what
the
judge
may
say
we
do
not
know
the
facts
as
they
have
been
expounded
to
him
but
if
caldigate
be
regarded
as
innocent
by
the
world
at
large
it
will
be
our
duty
so
to
regard
him
will
never
look
on
him
as
hester
husband
said
the
attorney
and
fanny
have
already
made
up
our
minds
that
we
would
at
once
ask
them
to
come
to
us
for
a
month
said
the
barrister
on
earth
will
induce
me
to
speak
to
him
said
the
attorney
you
will
be
very
cruel
to
hester
said
the
barrister
is
dreadful
to
me
said
the
attorney
you
should
care
so
little
for
your
sister
reputation
and
so
they
quarrelled
robert
leaving
the
house
in
great
dudgeon
went
down
on
the
following
morning
to
cambridge
at
puritan
grange
the
matter
was
argued
rather
by
rules
of
religion
than
of
law
but
as
the
rules
of
law
were
made
by
those
interested
to
fit
themselves
to
expediency
so
were
the
rules
of
religion
fitted
to
prejudice
no
hatred
could
be
more
bitter
than
that
which
bolton
felt
for
the
man
whom
she
would
permit
no
one
to
call
her
something
as
to
the
and
the
postmarks
was
told
her
but
with
a
woman
indomitable
obstinacy
she
closed
her
mind
against
all
that
as
indeed
did
also
the
banker
her
position
in
the
world
to
depend
upon
a
said
the
banker
intending
to
support
his
wife
then
she
arose
in
her
wrath
and
was
very
eloquent
position
in
the
world
she
said
does
it
matter
it
is
her
soul
though
all
men
and
all
women
should
call
her
a
castaway
it
would
be
nothing
if
the
lord
knew
her
to
be
guiltless
but
she
will
be
living
as
an
adulteress
with
an
adulterer
the
law
has
told
her
that
it
is
so
she
will
feel
every
day
and
every
night
that
she
is
a
transgressor
and
will
vainly
seek
consolation
by
telling
herself
that
men
have
pardoned
that
which
god
has
condemned
and
again
she
broke
forth
pardon
what
right
has
the
queen
to
pardon
an
adulterer
who
has
crept
into
the
bosom
of
a
family
and
destroyed
all
that
he
found
there
what
sense
of
justice
can
any
queen
have
in
her
bosom
who
will
send
such
a
one
back
to
heap
sin
upon
sin
to
fasten
the
bonds
of
iniquity
on
the
soul
of
my
child
and
postmarks
and
an
old
envelope
the
triviality
of
the
things
as
compared
with
the
importance
of
everlasting
life
made
her
feel
that
they
were
unworthy
to
be
even
noticed
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
the
presence
of
a
bodkin
might
be
ample
evidence
of
murder
indeed
when
her
daughter
everlasting
life
was
the
matter
in
question
then
they
told
her
of
dick
shand
she
too
had
heard
of
dick
shand
he
had
been
a
gambler
so
she
said
without
much
truth
he
was
known
for
a
drunkard
a
spendthrift
a
penniless
idle
who
had
wandered
back
home
without
clothes
to
his
back
which
was
certainly
untrue
as
the
yellow
trousers
had
been
bought
at
san
francisco
and
now
she
was
told
that
the
hated
miscreant
was
to
be
released
from
prison
because
such
a
one
as
this
was
ready
to
take
an
oath
she
had
a
knack
of
looking
on
such
men
like
dick
shand
and
caldigate
as
human
beings
who
had
as
it
were
lost
their
souls
before
death
so
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
them
otherwise
than
as
already
damned
that
caldigate
should
become
a
good
honest
loving
husband
or
dick
shand
a
witness
was
to
her
thinking
much
more
improbable
than
that
a
camel
should
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
she
would
press
her
lips
together
and
grind
her
teeth
and
shake
her
head
when
any
one
about
her
spoke
of
a
doubt
the
man
was
in
prison
at
any
rate
for
two
years
locked
up
safe
for
so
much
time
as
it
might
be
a
wild
beast
which
with
infinite
trouble
had
been
caged
and
now
they
were
talking
of
undoing
the
bars
and
allowing
the
monster
to
gorge
himself
again
with
his
prey
the
queen
were
told
the
truth
she
would
never
do
it
she
said
to
her
amazed
husband
queen
is
a
mother
and
a
woman
who
kneels
in
prayer
before
her
maker
something
should
be
done
so
that
the
truth
may
be
made
known
to
her
to
illuminate
all
the
darkness
which
was
betrayed
by
this
appeal
to
him
was
altogether
beyond
bolton
power
he
appreciated
the
depth
of
the
darkness
he
knew
for
instance
that
the
queen
herself
would
in
such
a
matter
act
so
simply
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
some
one
else
that
the
pardon
if
given
would
not
in
the
least
depend
on
her
majesty
sentiments
to
call
it
the
queen
pardon
was
a
simple
figure
of
speech
this
was
manifest
to
him
and
he
was
driven
to
endeavour
to
make
it
manifest
to
her
she
spoke
of
a
petition
to
be
sent
direct
to
the
queen
and
insinuated
that
robert
bolton
if
he
were
anything
like
a
real
brother
would
force
himself
into
her
majesty
presence
the
queen
said
her
husband
is
the
queen
mercy
is
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
even
i
know
as
much
as
that
and
she
is
to
be
made
to
believe
that
this
is
mercy
majesty
does
what
her
ministers
tell
her
she
would
if
she
was
told
the
truth
i
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
she
would
allow
such
a
man
as
that
to
be
let
loose
about
the
world
like
a
roaring
lion
if
she
knew
all
that
you
and
i
know
mercy
indeed
wo
be
meant
for
mercy
my
dear
then
do
you
not
know
that
the
man
has
another
wife
alive
a
wife
much
more
suited
to
him
than
our
poor
darling
nobody
would
hear
my
voice
while
there
was
yet
time
and
so
my
child
my
only
one
was
taken
away
from
me
by
her
own
father
and
her
own
brothers
and
no
one
now
will
exert
himself
to
bring
her
back
to
her
home
the
poor
old
man
had
had
but
little
comfort
in
his
home
since
his
daughter
marriage
and
was
now
more
miserable
than
ever
then
there
came
a
letter
from
hester
to
her
mother
since
last
visit
to
folking
there
had
been
some
correspondence
maintained
a
few
letters
had
passed
very
sad
on
each
side
in
which
the
daughter
had
assured
the
mother
of
her
undying
love
and
in
which
the
mother
had
declared
that
day
and
night
she
prayed
for
her
child
but
of
caldigate
neither
on
one
side
nor
on
the
other
had
mention
been
made
now
hester
who
was
full
of
hope
and
sick
with
hope
deferred
endeavoured
to
convince
her
mother
that
the
entire
charge
against
her
husband
had
been
proved
by
new
evidence
to
be
false
she
recapitulated
all
the
little
details
with
which
the
diligent
reader
must
by
this
time
be
too
well
acquainted
she
made
quite
clear
as
she
thought
the
infamous
plot
by
which
the
envelope
had
been
made
to
give
false
evidence
and
she
added
the
assurance
that
certainly
before
long
her
dear
dearest
husband
would
be
restored
to
her
then
she
went
on
to
implore
her
mother
renewed
affection
both
for
herself
and
him
and
her
boy
promising
that
bygones
should
all
be
bygones
and
then
she
ended
by
declaring
that
though
the
return
of
her
husband
would
make
her
very
happy
she
could
not
be
altogether
happy
unless
her
parents
also
should
be
restored
to
her
to
this
there
came
a
crushing
answer
as
follows
grange
hester
it
was
unnecessary
that
you
should
ask
for
a
renewal
of
your
mother
love
there
has
never
been
a
moment
in
which
she
has
not
loved
you
more
dearly
i
fear
than
one
human
creature
should
ever
love
another
when
i
was
strongest
in
opposing
you
i
did
so
from
love
when
i
watched
you
in
the
hall
all
those
hours
endeavouring
to
save
you
from
further
contact
with
the
man
who
had
injured
you
i
did
it
from
love
you
need
not
doubt
my
love
as
to
all
the
rest
i
can
not
agree
to
a
word
that
you
say
they
are
plotting
with
false
evidence
to
rescue
the
man
from
prison
i
will
not
give
way
to
it
when
my
soul
tells
me
that
it
is
untrue
as
your
mother
i
can
only
implore
you
to
come
back
to
me
and
to
save
yourself
from
the
further
evil
which
is
coming
upon
you
it
may
be
that
he
will
be
enabled
to
escape
and
then
you
will
again
have
to
live
with
a
husband
that
is
no
husband
unless
you
will
listen
to
your
mother
words
are
thinking
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
of
a
home
with
all
luxuries
and
ease
and
of
triumph
over
those
who
for
the
good
of
your
soul
have
hitherto
marred
your
worldly
joys
is
it
thus
that
you
hope
to
win
that
crown
of
everlasting
life
which
you
have
been
taught
to
regard
as
the
one
thing
worthy
of
a
struggles
is
it
not
true
that
since
that
wretched
day
on
which
you
were
taken
away
from
me
you
have
allowed
your
mind
to
pass
from
thoughts
of
eternity
to
longings
after
vain
joys
in
this
bitter
fruitless
vale
of
tears
if
that
be
so
can
he
who
has
so
encouraged
you
have
been
good
to
you
do
you
remember
david
words
some
trust
in
chariots
and
some
in
horses
but
we
will
remember
the
name
of
the
lord
our
god
and
then
again
they
are
brought
down
and
fallen
but
we
are
risen
and
stand
upright
ask
yourself
whether
you
have
stood
upright
or
have
fallen
since
you
left
your
house
whether
you
have
trusted
in
the
lord
your
god
or
in
horses
and
chariots
that
is
in
the
vain
comforts
of
an
easy
life
if
it
be
so
can
it
be
for
your
good
that
you
have
left
your
house
and
should
you
not
accept
this
scourge
that
has
fallen
upon
you
as
a
healing
balm
from
the
hands
of
the
lord
child
i
have
no
other
answer
to
send
you
that
i
love
you
till
my
very
bowels
yearn
after
you
is
most
true
but
i
can
not
profess
to
believe
a
lie
or
declare
that
to
be
good
which
i
know
to
be
evil
the
lord
bless
you
and
turn
your
feet
aright
and
restore
you
to
your
loving
mother
bolton
when
hester
read
this
she
was
almost
crushed
the
delay
since
the
new
tidings
had
come
to
her
had
not
in
truth
been
very
great
it
was
not
yet
quite
a
month
since
shand
had
been
at
folking
and
a
shorter
period
since
the
discoveries
of
bagwax
had
been
explained
to
her
but
the
days
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
long
and
day
after
day
she
thought
that
on
that
day
at
least
the
news
of
his
promised
release
would
be
brought
to
her
and
now
instead
of
these
news
there
came
this
letter
from
her
mother
harder
almost
in
its
words
than
any
words
which
had
hitherto
been
either
written
or
spoken
in
the
matter
even
when
all
the
world
should
have
declared
him
innocent
when
the
queen
and
the
great
officer
of
state
and
that
stern
judge
should
have
said
that
he
was
innocent
even
then
her
cruel
mother
would
refuse
to
receive
him
she
had
been
invited
to
ask
herself
certain
questions
as
to
the
state
of
her
soul
and
as
to
the
teaching
she
had
received
since
her
marriage
the
subject
is
one
on
which
there
is
no
possible
means
of
convergence
between
persons
who
have
learned
to
differ
her
mother
allusions
to
chariots
and
horses
was
to
her
the
enthusiasm
of
a
fanatic
no
doubt
teaching
had
come
to
her
from
her
husband
but
it
had
come
at
the
period
of
life
at
which
such
lessons
are
easily
learned
down
and
fallen
she
said
to
herself
we
are
all
brought
down
and
fallen
for
she
had
not
at
all
discarded
the
principles
of
her
religious
faith
a
woman
will
hardly
raise
herself
by
being
untrue
to
her
husband
she
too
yearned
for
her
mother
but
there
was
never
a
moment
doubt
in
her
mind
to
which
she
would
cling
if
at
last
it
should
become
necessary
that
one
should
be
cast
off
bolton
when
the
letter
had
been
despatched
sat
brooding
over
it
in
deep
regret
mixed
with
deeper
anger
she
was
preparing
for
herself
an
awful
tragedy
she
must
be
severed
for
ever
from
her
daughter
and
so
severed
with
the
opinion
of
all
her
neighbours
against
her
but
what
was
all
that
if
she
had
done
right
or
of
what
service
to
her
would
be
the
contrary
if
she
were
herself
to
think
nay
to
know
that
she
had
done
wrong
chapter
lvii
squire
caldigate
at
the
home
office
when
october
came
no
information
from
the
secretary
of
state
office
had
yet
reached
folking
and
the
two
inhabitants
there
were
becoming
almost
despondent
as
well
as
impatient
there
was
nobody
with
whom
they
could
communicate
sir
john
joram
had
been
obliged
to
answer
a
letter
from
the
squire
by
saying
that
as
soon
as
there
was
anything
to
tell
the
tidings
would
assuredly
be
communicated
to
him
from
the
home
office
the
letter
had
seemed
to
be
cold
and
almost
uncivil
but
sir
john
had
in
truth
said
all
that
he
could
say
to
raise
hopes
which
after
all
might
be
fallacious
would
have
been
on
his
part
a
great
fault
nor
in
spite
of
his
bet
was
he
very
sanguine
sharing
his
friend
opinion
as
to
judge
bramber
obstinacy
and
there
was
a
correspondence
between
the
elder
caldigate
and
the
home
office
in
which
the
letters
from
the
squire
were
long
and
well
argued
whereas
the
replies
which
always
came
by
return
of
post
were
short
and
altogether
formal
some
assistant
would
sign
his
name
at
the
end
of
three
lines
in
which
the
correspondent
was
informed
that
as
soon
as
the
matter
was
settled
the
result
would
be
communicated
who
does
not
know
the
sense
of
aggravated
injustice
which
comes
upon
a
sufferer
when
redress
for
an
acknowledged
evil
is
delayed
the
wronged
one
feels
that
the
whole
world
must
be
out
of
joint
in
that
all
the
world
does
not
rise
up
in
indignation
so
it
was
with
the
old
squire
who
watched
hester
cheek
becoming
paler
day
by
day
and
who
knew
by
her
silence
that
the
strong
hopes
which
in
his
presence
had
been
almost
convictions
were
gradually
giving
way
to
a
new
despair
then
he
would
abuse
the
secretary
of
state
say
hard
things
of
the
queen
express
his
scorn
as
to
the
fatuous
absurdities
of
the
english
law
and
would
make
her
understand
by
his
anger
that
he
also
was
losing
hope
during
these
days
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
committal
of
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
nor
would
judge
bramber
report
to
the
secretary
till
he
was
convinced
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
their
prosecution
it
was
not
much
to
him
that
caldigate
should
spend
another
week
in
prison
the
condition
of
hester
did
not
even
come
beneath
his
ken
when
he
found
allusion
to
it
in
the
papers
before
him
he
treated
it
as
a
matter
which
should
not
have
been
adduced
in
bringing
which
under
his
notice
there
had
been
something
akin
to
contempt
of
court
as
though
an
endeavour
had
been
made
to
talk
him
over
in
private
he
knew
his
own
character
and
was
indignant
that
such
an
argument
should
have
been
used
with
himself
he
was
perhaps
a
little
more
slow
something
was
added
to
his
deliberation
because
he
was
told
that
a
young
wife
and
an
infant
child
were
anxiously
expecting
the
liberation
of
the
husband
and
father
it
was
not
as
yet
clear
to
judge
bramber
that
the
woman
had
any
such
husband
or
that
the
child
could
claim
his
father
at
this
crisis
when
the
first
weeks
in
october
had
dragged
themselves
tediously
along
caldigate
in
a
fit
which
was
half
rage
and
half
moodiness
took
himself
off
to
london
he
did
not
tell
hester
that
he
was
going
till
the
morning
on
which
he
started
and
then
simply
assured
her
that
she
should
hear
from
him
by
every
post
till
he
returned
will
tell
me
the
truth
father
i
know
it
myself
i
will
tell
you
you
will
conceal
nothing
i
will
conceal
nothing
if
i
find
that
they
are
all
utterly
unjust
altogether
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
wrong
they
have
done
i
will
tell
you
even
that
and
thus
he
went
he
had
hardly
any
fixed
purpose
in
going
he
knew
that
sir
john
joram
was
not
in
london
and
that
if
he
were
in
town
he
ought
not
to
be
made
subject
to
visits
on
behalf
of
clients
to
call
upon
any
judge
in
such
a
matter
would
be
altogether
out
of
place
but
to
call
upon
such
a
judge
as
judge
bramber
would
be
very
vain
indeed
he
had
in
his
head
some
hazy
idea
of
forcing
an
answer
from
the
officials
in
downing
street
but
in
his
heart
he
did
not
believe
that
he
should
be
able
to
get
beyond
the
messengers
he
was
one
of
a
class
not
very
small
in
numbers
who
from
cultivating
within
their
bosom
a
certain
tendency
towards
suspicion
have
come
to
think
that
all
government
servants
are
idle
dilatory
supercilious
and
incompetent
that
some
of
these
faults
may
have
existed
among
those
who
took
wages
from
the
crown
in
the
time
of
george
iii
is
perhaps
true
and
the
memory
of
those
times
has
kept
alive
the
accusation
the
vitality
of
these
prejudices
calls
to
mind
the
story
of
the
nottinghamshire
farmer
who
when
told
of
the
return
of
charles
asked
what
had
become
of
charles
naseby
worcester
and
the
fatal
day
at
whitehall
had
not
yet
reached
him
tidings
of
these
things
had
only
been
approaching
him
during
these
twelve
years
the
true
character
of
the
civil
service
is
only
now
approaching
the
intelligence
of
those
who
are
still
shaking
their
heads
over
the
delinquencies
of
the
last
century
but
old
caldigate
was
a
man
peculiarly
susceptible
to
such
hard
judgments
from
the
crown
down
to
the
black
helmet
worn
by
the
policeman
who
was
occasionally
to
be
seen
on
folking
causeway
he
thought
that
all
such
headpieces
were
coverings
for
malpractices
the
bishop
wig
had
he
thought
disappeared
as
being
too
ridiculous
for
the
times
but
even
for
the
judge
wig
he
had
no
respect
judge
bramber
was
to
him
simply
pretentious
and
a
secretary
of
state
no
better
than
any
other
man
in
this
frame
of
mind
how
was
it
probable
that
he
should
do
any
good
at
the
home
office
but
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
went
to
the
home
office
and
asked
boldly
for
the
great
man
it
was
then
eleven
in
the
morning
and
neither
had
the
great
man
nor
even
any
of
the
deputy
great
men
as
yet
made
their
appearance
caldigate
of
course
fell
back
upon
his
old
opinion
as
to
public
functionaries
and
mentally
applied
opprobrious
epithets
to
men
who
taking
the
public
pay
could
not
be
at
their
posts
an
hour
before
he
was
not
aware
that
the
great
man
and
the
first
deputy
great
man
were
sitting
in
the
house
of
commons
at
on
that
morning
and
that
the
office
generally
was
driven
by
the
necessity
of
things
to
accommodate
itself
to
parliamentary
exigencies
then
he
was
asked
his
business
how
could
he
explain
to
a
messenger
that
his
son
had
been
unjustly
convicted
of
bigamy
and
was
now
in
prison
as
a
criminal
so
he
left
his
card
and
said
that
he
would
call
again
at
two
at
that
hour
precisely
he
appeared
again
and
was
told
that
the
great
man
himself
could
not
see
him
then
he
nearly
boiled
over
in
his
wrath
while
the
messenger
with
all
possible
courtesy
went
on
to
explain
that
one
of
the
deputies
was
ready
to
receive
him
the
deputy
was
the
honourable
septimus
brown
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
the
home
office
was
so
proud
that
it
considered
itself
to
be
superior
to
all
other
public
offices
whatever
simply
because
it
possessed
brown
he
had
been
there
for
forty
years
and
for
many
sessions
past
had
been
the
salvation
of
parliamentary
secretaries
and
he
was
the
uncle
of
an
earl
and
the
of
a
duke
and
a
marquis
not
to
know
brown
was
at
the
west
end
simply
to
be
unknown
brooks
was
proud
of
him
and
without
him
the
would
not
have
been
such
a
travellers
as
it
is
but
caldigate
when
he
was
told
that
brown
would
see
him
almost
left
the
lobby
in
instant
disgust
when
he
asked
who
was
brown
there
came
a
muttered
reply
in
which
was
the
only
word
audible
to
him
he
felt
that
were
he
to
go
away
in
dudgeon
simply
because
brown
was
the
name
of
the
man
whom
he
was
called
upon
to
see
he
would
put
himself
in
the
wrong
he
would
by
so
doing
close
his
own
mouth
against
complaint
which
to
caldigate
would
indeed
have
been
a
cutting
of
his
own
nose
off
his
own
face
with
a
scowl
therefore
he
consented
to
be
taken
away
to
brown
he
was
in
the
first
place
somewhat
scared
by
the
room
into
which
he
was
shown
which
was
very
large
and
very
high
there
were
two
clerks
with
brown
who
vanished
however
as
soon
as
the
squire
entered
the
room
it
seemed
that
brown
was
certainly
of
some
standing
in
the
office
or
he
would
not
have
had
two
and
a
sofa
in
his
room
caldigate
when
he
first
consented
to
see
brown
had
expected
to
be
led
into
an
uncarpeted
chamber
where
there
would
have
been
other
clerks
have
your
card
caldigate
said
the
official
doubt
you
have
called
in
reference
to
your
son
the
squire
had
determined
to
be
very
indignant
very
indignant
even
with
the
secretary
of
state
himself
to
whose
indifference
he
attributed
the
delay
which
had
occurred
but
almost
more
than
indignant
when
he
found
that
he
was
to
be
fobbed
off
with
brown
but
there
was
something
in
the
gentleman
voice
which
checked
his
indignation
there
was
something
in
brown
eye
a
mixture
of
and
authority
which
made
him
feel
that
he
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
the
gentleman
till
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
occasion
brown
was
a
handsome
hale
old
man
with
grey
whiskers
and
greyish
hair
with
a
nose
and
a
broad
forehead
carefully
dressed
with
a
light
waistcoat
and
a
checked
linen
cravat
wearing
a
frockcoat
and
very
well
made
boots
an
old
man
certainly
but
who
looked
as
though
old
age
must
naturally
be
the
happiest
time
of
life
when
a
digestion
is
thoroughly
good
and
his
pockets
adequately
filled
it
probably
is
so
such
were
the
circumstances
of
brown
who
as
the
squire
looked
at
him
seemed
to
partake
more
of
the
nature
of
his
nephew
and
than
of
the
browns
generally
sir
said
caldigate
have
called
about
my
son
who
i
think
i
may
undertake
to
say
has
been
wrongly
condemned
and
is
now
wrongly
retained
in
prison
beg
all
the
questions
caldigate
said
the
permanent
with
a
smile
maintain
that
what
you
call
the
questions
are
now
so
clearly
proved
as
not
to
admit
of
controversy
no
one
can
deny
that
a
conspiracy
was
got
up
against
my
son
shall
not
deny
it
certainly
caldigate
but
in
truth
i
know
very
little
or
nothing
about
it
the
squire
who
had
been
seated
rose
from
his
chair
as
in
wrath
about
to
pour
forth
his
indignation
why
was
he
treated
in
this
way
he
who
was
there
on
a
subject
of
such
tragic
interest
to
him
when
all
the
prospects
reputation
and
condition
of
his
son
were
at
stake
he
was
referred
to
a
gentleman
who
began
by
telling
him
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
you
will
sit
down
for
a
moment
caldigate
i
will
explain
all
that
can
be
explained
said
brown
who
was
in
such
matters
and
had
seen
the
signs
of
a
coming
storm
i
will
sit
down
such
cases
as
this
the
secretary
of
state
never
sees
those
who
are
interested
it
is
not
right
that
he
should
do
so
might
be
somebody
to
do
so
not
somebody
who
has
been
concerned
in
the
inquiry
the
secretary
of
state
if
he
saw
you
could
only
refuse
to
impart
to
you
any
portion
of
the
information
which
he
himself
may
possess
because
it
can
not
be
right
that
he
should
give
an
opinion
in
the
matter
while
he
himself
is
in
doubt
you
may
be
sure
that
he
will
open
his
mouth
to
no
one
except
to
those
from
whom
he
may
seek
assistance
till
he
has
been
enabled
to
advise
her
majesty
that
her
majesty
pardon
should
be
given
or
refused
will
that
be
am
afraid
that
i
can
not
name
a
day
you
caldigate
are
i
know
a
gentleman
of
position
in
your
county
and
a
magistrate
can
not
you
understand
how
minutely
facts
must
be
investigated
when
a
minister
of
the
crown
is
called
upon
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
either
upsetting
or
confirming
the
verdict
of
a
jury
facts
are
as
clear
as
daylight
they
be
so
your
son
will
soon
be
a
free
man
you
could
feel
what
his
wife
suffers
in
the
meantime
i
did
feel
it
though
we
all
felt
it
as
probably
we
do
for
though
we
be
officials
still
we
are
men
how
should
that
help
us
you
would
not
have
a
man
pardoned
because
his
wife
suffers
how
she
suffered
i
do
not
think
i
should
let
much
grass
grow
under
my
feet
while
i
was
making
the
inquiry
hope
there
is
no
such
grass
grows
here
the
truth
is
caldigate
that
as
a
rule
no
person
coming
here
on
such
an
errand
as
yours
is
received
at
all
the
secretary
of
state
can
not
either
in
his
own
person
or
in
that
of
those
who
are
under
him
put
himself
in
communication
with
the
friends
of
individuals
who
are
under
sentence
i
am
sure
that
you
as
a
man
conversant
with
the
laws
must
see
the
propriety
of
such
a
rule
think
i
have
a
right
to
express
my
natural
anxiety
will
not
deny
it
the
post
is
open
to
you
and
though
i
fear
that
our
replies
may
not
be
considered
altogether
satisfactory
we
do
give
our
full
attention
to
the
letters
we
receive
when
i
heard
that
you
had
been
here
and
had
expressed
an
intention
of
returning
from
respect
to
yourself
personally
i
desired
that
you
might
be
shown
into
my
room
but
i
could
not
have
done
that
had
it
not
been
that
i
myself
have
not
been
concerned
in
this
matter
then
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
caldigate
found
himself
compelled
to
leave
the
room
with
thanks
rather
than
with
indignation
he
walked
out
of
the
big
building
into
downing
street
and
down
the
steps
into
the
park
and
going
into
the
gardens
he
wandered
about
them
for
more
than
an
hour
sometimes
walking
slowly
along
the
and
then
seating
himself
for
a
while
on
one
of
the
benches
what
must
he
say
to
hester
in
the
letter
which
he
must
write
as
soon
as
he
was
back
at
his
hotel
he
tried
to
sift
some
wheat
out
of
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
the
chaff
of
brown
courtesy
was
there
not
some
indication
to
be
found
in
it
of
what
the
result
might
be
if
there
were
any
such
indication
it
was
he
thought
certainly
adverse
to
his
son
in
whose
bosom
might
be
the
ultimate
decision
whether
in
that
of
the
secretary
or
the
judge
or
of
some
experienced
clerk
in
the
office
it
was
manifest
that
the
facts
which
had
now
been
proven
to
the
world
at
large
for
many
days
had
none
of
the
effects
on
that
bosom
which
they
had
on
his
own
could
it
be
that
shand
was
false
that
bagwax
was
false
that
the
was
false
and
that
he
only
believed
them
to
be
true
was
it
possible
that
after
all
his
son
had
married
the
woman
he
crept
back
to
his
hotel
in
jermyn
street
and
there
he
wrote
his
letter
think
i
shall
be
home
but
i
will
not
say
so
for
certain
i
have
been
at
the
home
office
but
they
would
tell
me
nothing
a
man
was
very
civil
to
me
but
explained
that
he
was
civil
only
because
he
knew
nothing
about
the
case
i
think
i
shall
call
on
bagwax
at
the
and
after
that
return
to
folking
send
in
for
the
letters
and
then
you
will
hear
from
me
again
if
i
mean
to
stay
at
ten
on
the
following
day
he
was
at
the
and
there
he
found
bagwax
prepared
to
take
his
seat
exactly
at
that
hour
thereupon
he
resolved
with
true
radical
impetuosity
that
bagwax
was
a
much
better
public
servant
than
brown
caldigate
so
we
got
it
all
clear
at
last
said
bagwax
there
was
a
triumph
in
the
tone
of
the
clerk
voice
which
was
not
intelligible
to
the
despondent
old
squire
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
he
said
course
you
heard
what
i
know
all
about
the
of
course
secretaries
of
state
and
judges
of
the
court
of
queen
bench
only
had
their
wits
about
them
the
ought
to
have
been
quite
sufficient
said
bagwax
sententiously
more
is
there
the
sake
of
letting
the
world
know
what
can
be
done
in
our
department
it
is
a
pity
that
there
should
be
anything
more
there
is
something
for
god
sake
tell
me
mr
bagwax
have
heard
that
they
caught
crinkett
just
as
he
was
leaving
plymouth
a
word
the
woman
they
got
the
lot
of
caldigate
adamson
and
the
other
woman
have
agreed
to
give
evidence
and
are
to
be
let
go
did
you
hear
it
it
is
in
the
daily
but
i
knew
it
last
night
from
a
particular
source
i
have
been
a
good
deal
thrown
in
with
scotland
yard
since
this
began
caldigate
and
of
course
i
hear
things
then
it
occurred
to
the
squire
that
perhaps
he
had
flown
a
little
too
high
in
going
at
once
to
the
home
office
they
might
have
told
him
more
perhaps
in
scotland
yard
it
all
true
the
depositions
have
already
been
made
adamson
and
young
have
sworn
that
they
were
present
at
no
marriage
crinkett
they
say
means
to
plead
guilty
but
the
woman
sticks
to
it
like
wax
the
squire
had
written
a
letter
by
the
to
say
that
he
would
remain
in
london
that
further
day
he
now
wrote
again
at
the
telling
hester
all
that
bagwax
had
told
him
and
declaring
his
purpose
of
going
at
once
to
scotland
yard
if
this
story
were
true
then
certainly
his
son
would
soon
be
liberated
chapter
lviii
smirkie
is
it
was
on
a
tuesday
that
caldigate
made
his
visit
to
the
home
office
and
on
the
thursday
he
returned
to
cambridge
on
the
platform
whom
should
he
meet
but
his
squire
babington
who
had
come
into
cambridge
that
morning
intent
on
hearing
something
further
about
his
nephew
he
too
had
read
a
paragraph
in
his
newspaper
snapper
as
to
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
who
gave
evidence
against
john
caldigate
in
the
trial
at
the
last
cambridge
assizes
have
been
arrested
at
plymouth
just
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
country
for
new
zealand
these
are
the
persons
to
whom
it
was
proved
that
caldigate
had
paid
the
enormous
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
few
days
before
the
trial
it
is
alleged
that
they
are
to
be
indicted
for
perjury
if
this
be
true
it
implies
the
innocence
of
caldigate
who
as
our
readers
will
remember
was
convicted
of
bigamy
there
will
be
much
in
the
whole
case
for
caldigate
to
regret
but
nothing
so
much
as
the
loss
of
that
very
serious
sum
of
money
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
it
was
regarded
by
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
the
public
as
a
bribe
to
the
witnesses
why
it
should
have
been
paid
will
now
probably
remain
for
ever
a
mystery
the
squire
read
this
over
three
times
before
he
could
quite
understand
the
gist
of
it
and
at
last
perceived
or
thought
that
he
perceived
that
if
this
were
true
the
innocence
of
his
nephew
was
incontestable
but
julia
who
seemed
to
prefer
the
paternal
mansion
at
babington
to
her
own
peculiar
comforts
and
privileges
at
declared
that
she
did
believe
a
word
of
it
and
aunt
polly
whose
animosity
to
her
nephew
had
somewhat
subsided
was
not
quite
inclined
to
accept
the
statement
at
once
aunt
polly
expressed
an
opinion
that
newspapers
were
only
born
to
lie
but
added
that
had
she
seen
the
news
anywhere
else
she
would
not
have
been
a
bit
surprised
the
squire
was
prepared
to
swear
by
the
tidings
if
such
a
thing
was
not
to
be
put
into
a
newspaper
where
was
it
to
be
put
aunt
polly
could
not
answer
this
question
but
assisted
in
persuading
her
husband
to
go
into
cambridge
for
further
information
hope
this
is
true
said
the
suffolk
squire
tendering
his
hand
cordially
to
his
he
was
a
man
who
could
throw
all
his
heart
into
an
internecine
quarrel
on
a
monday
and
forget
the
circumstance
altogether
on
the
tuesday
what
are
you
speaking
asked
the
squire
of
folking
with
his
usual
placid
look
partly
indifferent
and
partly
sarcastic
covering
so
much
contempt
of
which
the
squire
from
suffolk
was
able
to
read
nothing
at
all
the
man
and
the
woman
the
witnesses
who
are
to
be
put
in
prison
at
plymouth
and
who
now
say
just
the
contrary
to
what
they
said
before
do
not
think
that
can
be
true
said
caldigate
you
have
seen
the
snapper
asked
babington
dragging
the
paper
out
of
his
pocket
at
that
they
were
now
in
a
cab
together
going
towards
the
town
and
caldigate
did
not
find
it
convenient
to
read
the
paragraph
but
of
course
he
knew
the
contents
is
quite
true
he
said
the
persons
you
allude
to
have
been
arrested
and
that
they
are
up
in
london
they
will
i
presume
be
tried
for
perjury
is
true
is
no
doubt
of
it
the
party
are
splitting
against
each
other
asked
babington
eagerly
of
them
have
already
sworn
that
what
they
swore
before
was
false
why
do
they
let
him
out
not
indeed
said
caldigate
should
have
thought
they
would
have
lost
a
moment
in
such
a
case
they
got
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
at
the
home
office
his
name
is
brown
if
you
could
have
seen
brown
i
sure
he
would
have
let
them
delay
a
minute
the
home
office
has
the
reputation
of
being
so
very
quick
in
answer
to
this
the
squire
of
folking
only
shook
his
head
he
would
not
even
condescend
to
say
that
he
had
seen
brown
and
certainly
not
to
explain
that
brown
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
most
and
man
that
he
had
ever
met
in
his
life
in
trumpington
street
they
parted
caldigate
proceeding
at
once
to
folking
and
babington
going
to
the
office
of
seely
the
attorney
be
out
in
a
day
or
two
said
the
man
of
suffolk
again
shaking
his
hand
do
you
tell
him
from
me
that
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
before
we
see
him
at
babington
i
been
true
to
him
almost
from
the
first
and
his
aunt
has
come
over
now
there
is
no
one
against
him
but
julia
and
these
are
things
of
course
which
young
women
wo
forget
caldigate
almost
became
genial
as
he
accepted
this
assurance
telling
himself
that
his
brother
magistrate
was
as
honest
as
he
was
silly
babington
who
was
well
known
in
cambridge
asked
many
questions
of
many
persons
from
seely
he
heard
but
little
seely
had
heard
of
the
arrest
made
at
plymouth
but
did
not
quite
know
what
to
think
about
it
if
it
was
all
square
then
he
supposed
his
client
must
after
all
be
innocent
but
this
went
altogether
against
the
grain
with
seely
it
be
so
babington
he
said
shall
always
think
the
paying
away
of
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
greatest
miracle
i
ever
came
across
nevertheless
seely
did
believe
that
the
two
witnesses
had
been
arrested
on
a
charge
of
perjury
the
squire
then
went
to
the
governor
of
the
jail
who
had
been
connected
with
him
many
years
as
a
county
magistrate
the
governor
had
heard
nothing
received
no
information
as
to
his
prisoner
from
any
one
in
authority
but
quite
believed
the
story
as
to
crinkett
and
the
woman
you
had
better
not
see
him
babington
said
the
governor
he
has
heard
nothing
as
yet
of
all
this
it
would
not
be
right
to
tell
him
till
we
know
what
it
will
come
to
assenting
to
this
babington
took
his
leave
with
the
conviction
on
his
mind
that
the
governor
was
quite
prepared
to
receive
an
order
for
the
liberation
of
his
prisoner
he
did
not
dare
to
go
to
robert
bolton
office
but
he
did
call
at
the
bank
have
heard
nothing
about
it
babington
said
the
old
clerk
over
the
counter
but
then
the
old
clerk
added
in
a
whisper
of
the
family
take
to
the
news
sir
but
everybody
else
seems
to
think
there
is
a
great
deal
in
it
if
he
did
marry
her
i
suppose
he
ought
to
be
let
out
should
think
he
ought
said
the
squire
indignantly
as
he
left
the
bank
thus
fortified
by
what
he
considered
to
be
the
general
voice
of
cambridge
he
returned
the
same
evening
to
babington
cambridge
including
caldigate
had
been
unanimous
in
believing
the
report
and
if
the
report
were
true
then
certainly
was
his
nephew
innocent
as
he
thought
of
this
some
appropriate
idea
of
the
injustice
of
the
evil
done
to
the
man
and
to
the
man
wife
came
upon
him
if
such
were
the
treatment
to
which
he
and
she
had
been
subjected
if
he
innocent
had
been
torn
away
from
her
and
sent
to
the
common
jail
and
if
she
certainly
innocent
had
been
wrongly
deprived
for
a
time
of
the
name
which
he
had
honestly
given
her
then
would
it
not
have
been
right
to
open
to
her
the
hearts
and
the
doors
at
babington
during
the
period
of
her
great
distress
as
he
thought
of
this
he
was
so
melted
by
ruth
that
a
tear
came
into
each
of
his
old
eyes
then
he
remembered
the
attempt
which
had
been
made
to
catch
this
man
for
julia
as
to
which
he
certainly
had
been
innocent
and
his
daughter
continued
wrath
that
a
woman
should
be
wrathful
in
such
a
matter
was
natural
to
him
he
conceived
that
it
behoved
a
woman
to
be
weak
irascible
affectionate
irrational
and
when
julia
would
be
loud
in
condemnation
of
her
cousin
and
would
pretend
to
commiserate
the
woes
of
the
poor
wife
who
had
been
left
in
australia
though
he
knew
the
source
of
these
feelings
he
could
not
be
in
the
least
angry
with
her
but
that
was
not
at
all
the
state
of
his
mind
in
reference
to
his
augustus
smirkie
sometimes
as
he
had
heard
smirkie
inveigh
against
the
enormity
of
bigamy
and
of
this
bigamist
in
particular
he
had
determined
that
some
as
he
would
call
it
he
would
give
the
vicar
of
a
moral
pat
on
the
head
which
should
silence
him
for
a
time
at
the
present
moment
when
he
got
into
his
carriage
at
the
station
to
be
taken
home
he
was
not
sure
whether
or
no
he
should
find
the
vicar
at
babington
since
their
marriage
smirkie
had
spent
much
of
his
time
at
babington
and
seemed
to
like
the
babington
claret
he
would
come
about
the
middle
of
the
week
and
return
on
the
saturday
evening
in
a
manner
which
the
squire
could
hardly
reconcile
with
all
that
he
had
heard
as
to
smirkie
exemplary
conduct
in
his
own
parish
the
squire
was
hospitality
itself
and
certainly
would
never
have
said
a
word
to
make
his
house
other
than
pleasant
to
his
own
husband
but
a
host
expects
that
his
corns
should
be
respected
whereas
smirkie
was
always
treading
on
babington
toes
hints
had
been
given
to
him
as
to
his
personal
conduct
which
he
did
not
take
altogether
in
good
part
his
absence
from
afternoon
service
had
been
alluded
to
and
it
had
been
suggested
to
him
that
he
ought
sometimes
to
be
more
careful
as
to
his
language
he
was
not
therefore
to
resent
on
the
part
of
smirkie
the
spirit
of
persecution
with
which
that
gentleman
seemed
to
regard
his
nephew
smirkie
in
the
house
he
asked
the
coachman
came
by
the
as
usual
said
the
man
it
was
very
much
usual
thought
the
squire
is
a
doubt
about
it
said
the
squire
to
his
wife
as
he
was
dressing
poor
fellow
is
as
innocent
as
you
ca
be
innocent
said
aunt
polly
he
never
married
the
woman
whom
they
say
he
married
he
ca
be
guilty
do
know
about
that
my
dear
either
did
marry
her
or
he
did
i
suppose
do
say
he
married
her
but
he
did
worse
he
did
said
the
squire
may
be
your
way
of
thinking
of
it
according
to
my
idea
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
he
did
a
great
deal
worse
if
he
did
marry
that
woman
he
did
commit
bigamy
when
he
married
this
one
argued
he
energetically
he
may
have
deserved
all
he
got
he
may
you
would
punish
a
man
for
murder
because
he
pay
his
debts
wo
have
it
that
he
innocent
said
babington
the
devil
is
if
you
come
to
that
are
not
or
you
would
talk
in
that
way
i
not
saying
anything
now
against
john
if
he
did
marry
the
woman
i
suppose
they
let
him
out
of
prison
and
i
for
one
shall
be
willing
to
take
him
by
the
hand
but
to
say
he
innocent
is
what
i
wo
put
up
with
has
sown
his
wild
oats
and
he
none
the
worse
for
that
he
as
good
as
the
rest
of
us
i
dare
say
for
yourself
said
the
wife
do
suppose
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
creator
he
is
as
good
a
man
as
augustus
be
the
word
was
spoken
with
great
energy
babington
at
the
moment
was
employed
in
sewing
a
button
on
the
wristband
of
her
husband
shirt
and
in
the
start
which
she
gave
stuck
the
needle
into
his
arm
exclaimed
the
agitated
lady
beg
your
pardon
but
not
his
said
the
squire
rubbing
the
wound
he
says
a
word
more
about
john
caldigate
in
my
presence
i
shall
tell
him
what
i
think
about
it
he
has
got
his
wife
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
him
after
that
they
went
and
dinner
was
at
once
announced
there
was
smirkie
to
give
an
arm
to
his
the
squire
took
his
married
daughter
while
the
other
two
followed
as
they
crossed
the
hall
julia
whispered
her
cousin
name
but
her
father
bade
her
be
silent
for
the
present
was
sure
it
was
not
true
said
smirkie
you
quite
wrong
said
the
squire
it
as
true
as
the
gospel
then
there
was
no
more
said
about
john
caldigate
till
the
servants
had
left
the
room
smirkie
general
appreciation
of
the
good
things
provided
did
not
on
this
occasion
give
the
owner
of
them
that
gratification
which
a
host
should
feel
in
the
pleasures
of
his
guests
he
ate
a
very
good
dinner
and
took
his
wine
with
a
full
appreciation
of
its
merits
such
an
appetite
on
the
part
of
his
friends
was
generally
much
esteemed
by
the
squire
of
babington
who
was
apt
to
press
the
bottle
upon
those
who
sat
with
him
in
the
manner
at
the
present
moment
he
eyed
his
enjoyments
with
a
feeling
akin
to
disappointment
there
was
a
habit
at
babington
with
the
ladies
of
sitting
with
the
squire
when
he
was
the
only
man
present
till
he
had
finished
his
wine
and
at
smirkie
instance
this
custom
was
continued
when
she
and
her
husband
were
at
the
house
fires
had
been
commenced
and
when
the
had
been
taken
away
they
clustered
round
the
hearth
the
squire
himself
sat
silent
in
his
place
out
of
humour
knowing
that
the
peculiar
subject
would
be
introduced
and
determined
to
make
himself
disagreeable
wo
you
bring
your
chair
round
said
one
of
the
girls
who
was
next
to
him
whereupon
he
did
move
his
chair
an
inch
or
two
you
hear
anything
about
john
said
the
other
unmarried
sister
i
heard
about
him
you
ca
help
hearing
about
him
in
cambridge
now
all
the
world
is
talking
about
him
what
does
all
the
world
say
asked
julia
flippantly
to
this
question
her
father
at
first
made
no
answer
the
world
may
say
i
can
not
alter
my
opinion
continued
julia
shall
never
be
able
to
look
upon
john
caldigate
and
hester
bolton
as
man
and
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
might
just
as
well
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
i
did
look
upon
you
and
smirkie
as
man
and
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
screamed
the
married
daughter
ejaculated
the
married
dear
that
is
a
strange
thing
to
say
of
your
own
child
whispered
the
mother
strange
said
julia
lifting
both
her
hands
up
in
an
agony
it
true
roared
the
squire
says
that
let
the
law
say
what
it
may
these
people
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
man
and
wife
by
me
said
julia
are
you
that
you
are
to
set
up
a
tribunal
of
your
own
and
if
you
judge
of
another
couple
in
that
way
why
is
some
one
to
judge
of
you
after
the
same
fashion
is
the
verdict
said
smirkie
verdict
has
pronounced
me
a
bigamist
it
might
for
anything
i
know
said
the
squire
angrily
woman
might
come
up
in
and
say
you
had
married
her
before
your
first
wife
you
are
very
disagreeable
said
julia
should
there
be
a
wicked
lie
told
in
one
place
as
well
as
in
another
there
has
been
a
wicked
lie
told
here
and
when
the
lie
is
proved
to
have
been
a
lie
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
he
is
to
tell
me
that
he
wo
believe
the
young
folk
to
be
man
and
wife
because
of
an
untrue
verdict
i
say
they
are
man
and
wife
as
good
a
man
and
wife
as
you
and
he
and
let
me
see
who
refuse
to
meet
them
as
such
in
my
house
smirkie
had
not
in
truth
made
the
offensive
remark
it
had
been
made
by
smirkie
but
it
had
suited
the
squire
to
attribute
it
to
the
clergyman
smirkie
was
now
put
upon
his
mettle
and
was
obliged
either
to
agree
or
to
disagree
he
would
have
preferred
the
former
had
he
not
been
somewhat
in
awe
of
his
wife
as
it
was
he
fell
back
upon
the
indiscreet
assertion
which
his
had
made
some
time
back
at
any
rate
sir
have
not
had
a
verdict
against
me
does
that
signify
great
deal
i
should
say
a
verdict
no
doubt
is
human
and
therefore
may
be
wrong
is
a
marriage
human
beg
your
pardon
sir
a
marriage
is
divine
if
it
is
a
marriage
your
marriage
in
our
church
would
have
been
divine
if
you
had
another
wife
alive
i
wish
you
would
i
shall
i
got
to
hammer
it
into
his
head
somehow
smirkie
drew
himself
up
and
grinned
bravely
but
the
squire
did
not
care
for
his
frowns
that
last
backhander
at
the
had
determined
him
caldigate
marriage
with
his
wife
was
not
in
the
least
interfered
with
by
the
verdict
took
away
the
lady
name
from
her
at
once
said
the
indignant
clergyman
just
what
it
did
do
said
the
squire
rising
from
his
chair
itself
it
did
affect
her
name
at
all
and
now
that
it
is
shown
to
have
been
a
mistaken
verdict
it
does
affect
her
position
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
this
that
anybody
who
does
like
to
meet
him
and
his
wife
as
honoured
guests
in
my
house
had
better
stay
away
do
you
hear
that
julia
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
walked
out
before
them
all
into
the
and
not
another
word
was
said
that
night
about
the
matter
smirkie
indeed
did
not
utter
a
word
on
any
subject
till
at
an
early
hour
he
wished
them
all
with
dignified
composure
chapter
lix
how
the
doubted
it
what
i
call
an
awful
shame
holt
and
parson
bromley
were
standing
together
on
the
causeway
at
folking
and
the
former
was
speaking
the
subject
under
discussion
was
of
course
the
continued
detention
of
john
caldigate
in
the
county
prison
can
not
at
all
understand
it
said
bromley
no
understanding
nothing
about
it
sir
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
county
knows
as
there
was
no
other
marriage
and
yet
they
wo
let
out
it
sheer
spite
because
he
would
vote
for
their
man
last
hardly
think
that
mr
holt
as
sure
of
it
as
i
stands
here
said
holt
slapping
his
thigh
else
they
keep
in
for
it
just
like
their
ways
holt
was
one
of
a
rare
class
being
a
liberal
farmer
a
liberal
that
is
in
politics
as
was
also
bromley
a
liberal
among
parsons
the
caldigates
had
always
been
liberal
and
holt
had
been
brought
up
to
agree
with
his
landlord
he
was
now
beyond
measure
acerbated
because
john
caldigate
had
not
been
as
yet
declared
innocent
on
evidence
which
was
altogether
conclusive
to
himself
the
conservatives
were
now
in
power
and
nothing
seemed
so
natural
to
holt
as
that
the
home
secretary
should
keep
his
landlord
in
jail
because
the
caldigates
were
liberals
bromley
could
not
quite
agree
to
this
but
he
also
was
of
opinion
that
a
great
injustice
was
being
done
he
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
young
wife
almost
daily
and
knew
the
havoc
which
hope
turned
into
despair
was
making
with
her
another
week
had
now
gone
by
since
the
old
squire
had
been
up
in
town
and
nothing
yet
had
been
heard
from
the
secretary
of
state
all
the
world
knew
that
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
were
in
custody
and
still
no
tidings
came
yet
the
husband
convicted
on
the
evidence
of
these
perjurers
was
detained
in
prison
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
and
hester
heart
was
very
sick
within
her
do
they
not
tell
me
something
she
said
when
her
vainly
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
why
not
indeed
he
could
only
say
hard
things
of
the
whole
system
under
which
the
perpetration
of
so
great
a
cruelty
was
possible
and
reiterate
his
opinion
that
in
spite
of
that
system
they
must
before
long
let
his
son
go
free
the
delay
in
truth
was
not
at
the
home
office
judge
bramber
could
not
as
yet
quite
make
up
his
mind
it
is
hoped
that
the
reader
has
made
up
his
but
the
reader
knows
somewhat
more
than
the
judge
knew
crinkett
had
confessed
nothing
though
a
rumour
had
got
abroad
that
he
intended
to
plead
guilty
euphemia
smith
was
constant
in
her
assertion
to
all
those
who
came
near
her
that
she
had
positively
been
married
to
the
man
at
ahalala
adamson
and
anna
young
were
ready
now
to
swear
that
all
which
they
had
sworn
before
was
false
but
it
was
known
to
the
police
that
they
had
quarrelled
bitterly
as
to
the
division
of
the
spoil
ever
since
the
money
had
been
paid
to
the
it
was
known
that
anna
young
had
succeeded
in
getting
nothing
from
the
other
woman
and
that
the
man
had
unwillingly
accepted
his
small
share
fearing
that
otherwise
he
might
get
nothing
they
were
not
trustworthy
witnesses
and
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
the
other
two
could
be
convicted
on
their
evidence
the
judge
as
he
turned
it
all
over
in
his
mind
was
by
no
means
sure
that
the
verdict
was
a
mistaken
verdict
it
was
at
any
rate
a
verdict
it
was
a
decision
constitutionally
arrived
at
from
a
jury
this
sending
back
of
the
matter
to
him
hardly
was
constitutional
it
was
abhorrent
to
his
nature
not
that
a
guilty
man
should
escape
which
he
knew
to
be
an
affair
occurring
every
day
but
that
a
guilty
man
who
had
been
found
to
be
guilty
should
creep
back
through
the
meshes
of
the
law
he
knew
how
many
chances
were
given
by
the
practice
of
british
courts
to
an
offender
on
his
trial
and
he
was
quite
in
favour
of
those
chances
he
would
be
urgent
in
telling
a
jury
to
give
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
but
when
the
transgressor
with
all
those
loopholes
stopped
stood
before
him
convicted
then
he
felt
a
delight
in
the
tightness
of
the
grip
with
which
he
held
the
wretch
and
would
tell
himself
that
the
world
in
which
he
lived
was
not
as
yet
all
astray
in
that
a
guilty
man
could
still
be
made
to
endure
the
proper
reward
of
his
guilt
it
was
with
him
as
when
a
hunter
has
hunted
a
fox
after
the
approved
laws
of
venery
there
have
been
a
dozen
ways
of
killing
the
animal
of
which
he
has
scorned
to
avail
himself
he
has
been
careful
to
let
him
break
from
his
covert
regarding
all
who
would
stop
him
as
enemies
to
himself
it
has
been
a
point
of
honour
with
him
that
the
animal
should
suffer
no
undue
impediment
any
shown
to
the
favoured
one
in
his
course
is
an
injury
done
to
the
hunter
himself
let
no
man
head
the
fox
let
no
man
strive
to
drive
him
back
upon
the
hounds
let
all
be
done
by
hunting
law
in
accordance
with
those
laws
which
give
so
many
chances
of
escape
but
when
the
hounds
have
run
into
their
quarry
not
all
the
eloquence
of
all
the
gods
should
serve
to
save
that
doomed
life
so
it
was
with
judge
bramber
and
a
convicted
prisoner
he
would
give
the
man
the
full
benefit
of
every
quibble
of
the
law
till
he
was
convicted
he
would
be
severe
on
witnesses
harsh
to
the
police
apparently
a
very
friend
to
the
man
standing
at
the
bar
till
the
time
came
for
him
to
array
the
evidence
before
the
jury
then
he
was
inexorable
and
when
the
verdict
had
been
once
pronounced
the
prisoner
was
but
as
a
fox
about
to
be
thrown
to
the
hounds
and
now
there
was
a
demand
that
this
particular
fox
should
be
put
back
into
his
covert
the
secretary
of
state
could
put
him
back
if
he
thought
fit
but
in
these
matters
there
was
so
often
a
touch
of
cowardice
why
did
not
the
secretary
do
it
without
asking
him
there
had
arisen
no
question
of
law
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
verdict
as
found
upon
the
evidence
given
at
the
trial
the
doubt
which
had
arisen
since
had
come
from
further
evidence
of
which
the
secretary
was
as
well
able
to
judge
as
he
no
doubt
the
case
was
difficult
there
had
been
gross
misdoing
on
both
sides
but
if
caldigate
had
not
married
the
woman
why
had
he
paid
those
twenty
thousands
why
had
he
written
those
words
on
the
envelope
there
was
doubt
enough
now
but
the
time
for
giving
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
was
gone
the
fox
had
been
fairly
hunted
and
judge
bramber
thought
that
he
had
better
die
but
he
hesitated
and
while
he
was
hesitating
there
came
to
him
a
little
reminder
a
most
gentle
hint
in
the
shape
of
a
note
from
the
secretary
of
state
private
secretary
the
old
squire
visit
to
the
office
had
not
seemed
to
himself
to
be
satisfactory
but
he
had
made
a
friend
for
himself
in
brown
brown
looked
into
the
matter
and
was
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
well
to
pardon
the
young
man
even
though
there
had
been
some
jumping
over
a
broomstick
at
ahalala
why
should
things
not
be
made
comfortable
here
at
home
what
harm
would
a
pardon
do
to
any
one
whereas
there
were
so
many
whom
it
would
make
happy
so
he
asked
the
secretary
whether
that
was
a
hard
case
of
young
caldigate
the
secretary
whispered
that
it
was
in
bramber
hands
upon
which
brown
observed
that
if
so
it
was
certainly
hard
but
the
conversation
was
not
altogether
thrown
away
for
on
that
afternoon
the
private
secretary
wrote
his
note
judge
bramber
when
he
received
the
note
immediately
burned
it
and
this
he
did
with
considerable
energy
of
action
if
they
would
send
him
such
cases
as
that
what
right
had
they
to
remind
him
of
his
duty
he
was
not
going
to
allow
any
private
secretary
or
any
secretary
of
state
to
hurry
him
there
was
no
life
or
death
in
this
matter
of
what
importance
was
it
that
so
manifest
an
as
this
young
caldigate
should
remain
in
prison
a
day
or
two
more
a
man
who
had
attempted
to
bribe
four
witnesses
by
twenty
thousand
pounds
it
was
an
additional
evil
that
such
a
one
should
have
such
a
sum
for
such
a
purpose
but
still
he
felt
that
there
was
a
duty
thrown
upon
him
and
he
sat
down
with
all
the
papers
before
him
determined
to
make
up
his
mind
before
he
rose
from
his
chair
he
did
make
up
his
mind
but
did
so
at
last
by
referring
back
the
responsibility
to
the
secretary
of
state
question
is
one
altogether
of
evidence
he
said
not
of
law
any
man
is
as
able
to
reach
a
true
decision
as
i
am
it
is
such
a
question
as
should
be
left
to
a
jury
and
would
justify
a
trial
on
appeal
if
that
were
practicable
it
would
be
well
that
the
case
should
stand
over
till
thomas
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
shall
have
been
tried
for
perjury
which
as
i
understand
will
take
place
at
the
next
winter
assizes
if
the
secretary
of
state
thinks
that
the
delay
would
be
too
long
i
would
humbly
suggest
that
he
should
take
her
majesty
pleasure
in
accordance
with
his
own
opinion
as
to
the
evidence
when
that
document
was
read
at
the
home
office
by
the
few
who
were
privileged
to
read
it
they
knew
that
judge
bramber
had
been
in
a
very
ill
humour
but
there
was
no
help
for
that
the
judge
had
been
asked
for
advice
and
had
refused
to
give
it
or
had
advised
if
his
remark
on
that
subject
was
to
be
taken
for
advice
that
the
consideration
of
the
matter
should
be
postponed
for
another
three
months
the
case
if
there
was
any
case
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
was
not
one
for
pardon
but
for
such
redress
as
might
now
be
given
for
a
most
gross
injustice
the
man
had
been
put
to
a
very
great
expense
and
had
been
already
in
prison
for
ten
or
eleven
weeks
and
his
further
detention
would
be
held
to
have
been
very
cruel
if
it
should
appear
at
last
that
the
verdict
had
been
wrong
the
public
press
was
already
using
strong
language
on
the
subject
and
the
secretary
of
state
was
not
indifferent
to
the
public
press
judge
bramber
thoroughly
despised
the
press
though
he
would
have
been
very
angry
if
his
had
not
been
ready
for
him
at
breakfast
every
morning
and
two
or
three
questions
had
already
been
asked
in
the
house
of
commons
the
secretary
of
state
with
that
habitual
strategy
without
which
any
secretary
of
state
must
be
held
to
be
unfit
for
the
position
which
he
holds
contrived
to
answer
the
questions
so
as
to
show
that
while
the
gentlemen
who
asked
them
were
the
most
indiscreet
of
individuals
he
was
the
most
discreet
of
secretaries
and
he
did
this
though
he
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
judge
bramber
delay
was
unjustifiable
but
what
would
be
thought
of
a
secretary
of
state
who
would
impute
blame
in
the
house
of
commons
to
one
of
the
judges
of
the
land
before
public
opinion
had
expressed
itself
so
strongly
on
the
matter
as
to
make
such
expression
indispensable
he
did
not
think
that
he
was
in
the
least
untrue
in
throwing
blame
back
upon
the
questioners
and
in
implying
that
on
the
side
of
the
crown
there
had
been
no
undue
delay
though
at
the
moment
he
was
inwardly
provoked
at
the
dilatoriness
of
the
judge
public
opinion
was
expressing
itself
very
strongly
in
the
press
daily
had
a
beautifully
sensational
article
written
by
their
very
best
artist
the
whole
picture
was
drawn
with
a
cunning
hand
the
young
wife
in
her
lonely
house
down
in
cambridge
which
the
artist
not
inaptly
called
the
moated
grange
the
noble
innocent
husband
eating
his
heart
out
within
the
bars
of
a
county
prison
and
with
very
little
else
to
eat
the
indignant
father
driven
almost
to
madness
by
the
wrongs
done
to
his
son
and
heir
had
the
son
not
been
an
heir
this
point
would
have
been
much
less
touching
and
then
the
old
evidence
was
dissected
and
the
new
evidence
against
the
new
culprits
explained
in
regard
to
the
new
culprits
the
writer
was
very
loud
in
expressing
his
purpose
to
say
not
a
word
against
persons
who
were
still
to
be
tried
but
immediately
upon
that
he
went
on
and
said
a
great
many
words
against
them
assuming
all
that
was
said
about
them
to
be
true
he
asked
whether
the
country
would
for
a
moment
endure
the
idea
that
a
man
in
caldigate
position
should
be
kept
in
prison
on
the
evidence
of
such
miscreants
when
he
came
to
bagwax
and
the
postmarks
he
explained
the
whole
matter
with
almost
more
than
accuracy
he
showed
that
the
impression
could
not
possibly
have
been
made
till
after
the
date
it
conveyed
he
fell
into
some
little
error
as
to
the
fabrication
of
the
in
the
colony
not
having
quite
seized
bagwax
great
point
but
it
was
a
most
telling
article
and
the
writer
as
he
turned
it
off
at
his
club
and
sent
it
down
to
the
office
of
the
paper
was
ready
to
bet
a
note
that
caldigate
would
be
out
before
a
week
was
over
the
secretary
of
state
saw
the
article
and
acknowledged
its
power
and
then
even
the
turned
round
and
cautiously
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
time
had
come
for
mercy
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
public
opinion
was
running
very
high
in
caldigate
favour
and
that
the
case
had
become
thoroughly
popular
people
were
again
beginning
to
give
in
london
and
at
every
party
the
matter
was
discussed
it
was
a
peculiarly
interesting
case
because
the
man
had
thrown
away
so
large
a
sum
of
money
people
like
to
have
a
nut
to
crack
which
is
a
gordian
knot
to
undo
which
can
not
even
be
cut
nobody
could
understand
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
would
any
man
pay
such
a
sum
with
the
object
of
buying
off
false
witnesses
and
do
it
in
such
a
manner
that
all
the
facts
must
be
brought
to
light
when
he
was
tried
it
was
said
here
and
there
that
he
had
paid
the
money
because
he
owed
it
but
then
it
had
been
shown
so
clearly
that
he
had
not
owed
any
one
a
penny
nevertheless
the
men
were
all
certain
that
he
was
not
guilty
and
the
ladies
thought
that
whether
he
were
guilty
or
not
did
not
matter
much
he
certainly
ought
to
be
released
from
prison
but
yet
the
secretary
doubted
in
that
unspoken
but
heartfelt
accusation
of
cowardice
which
the
judge
had
made
against
the
great
officer
of
state
there
had
been
some
truth
how
would
it
be
if
it
should
be
made
to
appear
at
the
approaching
trial
that
the
two
reprobates
who
had
turned
queen
evidence
against
their
associates
were
to
break
down
altogether
in
their
assertions
it
might
possibly
then
become
quite
apparent
that
caldigate
had
married
the
woman
and
had
committed
bigamy
when
he
would
already
have
been
pardoned
for
the
last
three
months
the
pardon
in
that
case
would
not
do
away
with
the
verdict
and
the
pardoned
man
would
be
a
convicted
bigamist
what
then
would
be
the
condition
of
his
wife
and
child
if
subsequent
question
should
arise
as
to
the
boy
legitimacy
as
might
so
probably
be
the
case
in
what
light
would
he
appear
he
who
had
taken
upon
himself
on
his
own
responsibility
to
extort
from
her
majesty
a
pardon
in
opposition
to
a
righteous
and
just
verdict
in
opposition
to
the
judge
who
had
tried
the
case
he
had
been
angry
with
judge
bramber
for
not
deciding
and
was
now
frightened
at
the
necessity
of
deciding
himself
in
this
emergency
he
sent
for
the
gentleman
who
had
managed
the
prosecution
on
the
part
of
the
crown
and
asked
him
to
read
up
the
case
again
never
was
convinced
of
the
prisoner
guilt
said
the
barrister
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
we
can
not
be
convinced
the
strongest
point
against
him
was
the
payment
of
the
money
it
is
possible
that
he
paid
it
from
a
quixotic
feeling
of
honour
false
witnesses
and
that
before
the
trial
said
the
secretary
there
may
have
been
a
hope
that
in
spite
of
what
he
said
himself
as
to
their
staying
they
would
take
themselves
off
when
they
had
got
the
money
in
that
way
he
may
have
persuaded
himself
that
as
an
honest
man
he
ought
to
make
the
payment
then
as
to
the
witnesses
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
they
were
willing
to
lie
even
if
their
main
story
were
true
they
were
lying
as
to
details
you
would
advise
a
pardon
think
so
said
the
barrister
who
was
not
responsible
for
his
advice
waiting
for
the
other
trial
the
perjury
be
then
proved
or
even
so
nearly
proved
as
to
satisfy
the
outside
world
the
man
detention
will
be
thought
to
have
been
a
hardship
the
secretary
of
state
thanked
the
barrister
and
let
him
go
he
then
went
down
to
the
house
and
amidst
the
turmoil
of
a
strong
party
conflict
at
last
made
up
his
mind
it
was
unjust
that
such
responsibility
should
be
thrown
upon
any
one
person
there
ought
to
be
some
court
of
appeal
for
such
cases
he
was
sure
of
that
now
but
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
early
on
the
next
morning
the
queen
should
be
advised
to
allow
john
caldigate
to
go
free
chapter
lx
how
bolton
was
nearly
conquered
one
morning
about
the
middle
of
october
robert
bolton
walked
out
from
cambridge
to
puritan
grange
with
a
letter
in
his
pocket
a
very
long
and
a
very
serious
letter
the
day
was
that
on
which
the
secretary
of
state
was
closeted
with
the
barrister
and
on
the
evening
of
which
he
at
length
determined
that
caldigate
should
be
allowed
to
go
free
there
had
therefore
been
no
pardon
granted
as
yet
but
in
the
letter
the
writer
stated
that
such
pardon
would
almost
certainly
be
awarded
it
was
from
william
bolton
in
london
to
his
brother
the
attorney
and
was
written
with
the
view
of
proving
to
all
the
boltons
at
cambridge
that
it
was
their
duty
to
acknowledge
hester
as
the
undoubted
wife
of
john
caldigate
and
recommended
also
that
for
hester
sake
they
should
receive
him
as
her
husband
the
letter
had
been
written
with
very
great
care
and
had
been
powerful
enough
to
persuade
robert
bolton
of
the
truth
of
the
first
proposition
it
was
very
long
and
as
it
repeated
all
the
details
of
the
evidence
for
and
against
the
verdict
it
shall
not
be
repeated
here
at
its
full
length
its
intention
was
to
show
that
looking
at
probabilities
and
judging
from
all
that
was
known
there
was
much
more
reason
to
suppose
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
at
ahalala
than
that
there
had
been
one
the
writer
acknowledged
that
while
the
verdict
stood
confirmed
against
the
man
hester
family
were
bound
to
regard
it
and
to
act
as
though
they
did
not
doubt
its
justice
but
that
when
that
verdict
should
be
set
aside
as
far
as
any
criminal
verdict
can
be
set
aside
by
the
queen
pardon
then
the
family
would
be
bound
to
suppose
that
they
who
advised
her
majesty
had
exercised
a
sound
discretion
am
sure
you
will
all
agree
with
me
he
said
no
personal
feeling
in
regard
to
caldigate
should
influence
your
judgment
for
myself
i
like
the
man
but
that
i
think
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
opinion
if
it
had
been
the
case
that
having
a
wife
living
he
had
betrayed
my
sister
into
all
the
misery
of
a
false
marriage
and
had
made
her
the
mother
of
a
nameless
child
i
should
have
felt
myself
bound
to
punish
him
to
every
extent
within
my
power
i
do
not
think
it
unchristian
to
say
that
in
such
a
case
i
could
not
have
forgiven
him
but
presuming
it
to
be
otherwise
as
we
all
shall
be
bound
to
do
if
he
be
pardoned
then
for
hester
sake
we
should
receive
the
man
with
whom
her
lot
in
life
is
so
closely
connected
she
poor
dear
has
suffered
enough
and
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
further
trouble
of
our
estrangement
if
we
acknowledge
the
charge
against
him
to
be
untrue
is
there
any
reason
for
a
quarrel
if
he
has
not
been
bad
to
our
sister
in
that
matter
he
has
been
altogether
good
to
her
she
has
for
him
that
devotion
which
is
the
best
evidence
that
a
marriage
has
been
well
chosen
presuming
him
to
be
innocent
we
must
confess
as
to
her
that
she
has
been
simply
loyal
to
her
husband
with
such
loyalty
as
every
married
man
would
desire
for
this
she
should
be
rewarded
rather
than
punished
write
to
you
thinking
that
in
this
way
i
may
best
reach
my
father
and
bolton
i
would
go
down
and
see
them
did
i
not
know
that
your
words
would
be
more
efficacious
with
them
than
my
own
and
i
do
it
as
a
duty
to
my
sister
which
i
feel
myself
bound
to
perform
pray
forgive
me
if
i
remind
you
that
in
this
respect
she
has
a
peculiar
right
to
a
performance
of
your
duty
in
the
matter
you
counselled
and
carried
out
the
marriage
not
at
all
unfortunately
if
the
man
be
as
i
think
innocent
but
you
are
bound
at
any
rate
to
sift
the
evidence
very
closely
and
not
to
mar
her
happiness
by
refusing
to
acknowledge
him
if
there
be
reasonable
ground
for
supposing
the
verdict
to
have
been
incorrect
sift
the
evidence
indeed
robert
bolton
had
done
that
already
very
closely
bagwax
and
the
stamps
had
not
moved
him
nor
the
direct
assurance
of
dick
shand
but
the
incarceration
by
government
of
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
had
shaken
him
and
the
fact
that
they
had
endeavoured
to
escape
the
moment
they
heard
of
shand
arrival
but
not
the
less
had
he
hated
caldigate
the
feeling
which
had
been
impressed
on
his
mind
when
the
first
facts
were
made
known
to
him
remained
caldigate
had
been
engaged
to
marry
the
woman
and
had
lived
with
her
and
had
addressed
her
as
his
wife
the
man
had
in
a
way
got
the
better
of
him
and
then
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
then
again
caldigate
manner
to
himself
he
could
not
get
over
his
personal
aversion
and
therefore
unconsciously
wished
that
his
should
be
guilty
wished
at
any
rate
that
he
should
be
kept
in
prison
gradually
had
fallen
upon
him
the
conviction
that
caldigate
would
be
pardoned
and
then
of
course
there
had
come
much
consideration
as
to
his
sister
condition
he
too
was
a
conscientious
and
an
affectionate
man
he
was
well
aware
of
his
duty
to
his
sister
while
he
was
able
to
assure
himself
that
caldigate
was
not
her
husband
he
could
satisfy
himself
by
a
conviction
that
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
them
apart
thus
he
could
hate
the
man
advocate
all
severity
against
the
man
and
believe
the
while
that
he
was
doing
his
duty
to
his
sister
as
an
affectionate
brother
but
now
there
was
a
revulsion
it
was
three
weeks
since
he
and
his
brother
had
parted
not
with
the
kindest
feelings
up
in
london
and
during
that
time
the
sifting
of
the
evidence
had
been
going
on
within
his
own
breast
from
hour
to
hour
and
now
this
letter
had
come
a
letter
which
he
could
not
put
away
in
anger
a
letter
which
he
could
not
ignore
to
quarrel
permanently
with
his
brother
william
was
quite
out
of
the
question
he
knew
the
value
of
such
a
friend
too
well
and
had
been
too
often
guided
by
his
advice
so
he
sifted
the
evidence
once
again
and
then
walked
off
to
puritan
grange
with
the
letter
in
his
pocket
in
these
latter
days
old
bolton
did
not
go
often
into
cambridge
men
said
that
his
daughter
misfortune
had
broken
him
very
much
it
was
perhaps
the
violence
of
his
wife
religion
rather
than
the
weight
of
his
daughter
sufferings
which
cowed
him
since
hester
awful
obstinacy
had
become
hopeless
to
bolton
an
atmosphere
of
sackcloth
and
ashes
had
made
itself
more
than
ever
predominant
at
puritan
grange
if
any
one
hated
papistry
bolton
did
so
but
from
a
similar
action
of
religious
fanaticism
she
had
fallen
into
worse
that
papistical
that
men
and
women
were
all
worms
to
be
trodden
under
foot
and
grass
of
the
field
to
be
thrown
into
the
oven
was
borne
in
so
often
on
poor
bolton
that
he
had
not
strength
left
to
go
to
the
bank
and
they
were
nearer
akin
to
worms
and
more
like
grass
of
the
field
than
ever
because
hester
would
stay
at
folking
instead
of
returning
to
her
own
home
she
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
when
robert
bolton
was
shown
into
the
morning
she
was
sitting
with
the
bible
before
her
but
with
some
domestic
needlework
in
her
lap
he
was
doing
nothing
not
even
having
a
book
ready
to
his
hand
thus
he
would
sit
the
greater
part
of
the
day
listening
to
her
when
she
would
read
to
him
but
much
preferring
to
be
left
alone
his
life
had
been
active
and
prosperous
but
the
evening
of
his
days
was
certainly
not
happy
his
son
robert
had
been
anxious
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him
first
but
found
himself
unable
to
separate
them
without
an
amount
of
ceremony
which
would
have
filled
her
with
suspicion
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
from
william
he
said
addressing
himself
to
his
father
bolton
is
i
fear
of
the
world
worldly
said
the
words
always
savour
to
me
of
the
huge
ungodly
city
in
which
he
dwells
but
that
this
was
not
a
time
for
such
an
exercise
he
would
have
endeavoured
to
expose
the
prejudice
of
the
lady
as
it
was
he
was
very
gentle
is
a
man
who
understands
his
duty
well
he
said
do
that
but
few
act
up
to
their
understanding
she
rejoined
think
sir
i
had
better
read
his
letter
to
you
it
has
been
written
with
that
intention
and
i
am
bound
to
let
you
know
the
contents
perhaps
bolton
will
let
me
go
to
the
end
so
that
we
may
discuss
it
afterwards
but
bolton
would
not
let
him
go
to
the
end
he
had
not
probably
expected
such
forbearance
at
every
point
as
to
the
evidence
she
interrupted
him
striving
to
show
that
the
arguments
used
were
of
no
real
weight
she
was
altogether
irrational
but
still
she
argued
her
case
well
she
withered
bagwax
and
dick
with
her
scorn
she
ridiculed
the
quarrels
of
the
male
and
female
witnesses
she
reviled
the
secretary
of
state
and
declared
it
to
be
a
shame
that
the
queen
should
have
no
better
advisers
but
when
william
bolton
spoke
of
hester
happiness
and
of
the
concessions
which
should
be
made
to
secure
that
she
burst
out
into
eloquence
what
did
he
know
of
her
happiness
was
it
not
manifest
that
he
was
alluding
to
this
world
without
a
thought
of
the
next
a
reflection
as
to
her
soul
welfare
has
once
come
across
his
mind
she
said
an
idea
as
to
the
sin
with
which
her
soul
would
be
laden
were
she
to
continue
to
live
with
the
man
when
knowing
that
he
was
not
her
husband
would
know
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
attorney
she
ought
to
know
it
said
bolton
again
begging
the
whole
question
but
he
persevered
as
he
had
resolved
to
do
when
he
left
his
house
upon
this
difficult
mission
am
sure
my
father
will
acknowledge
he
said
however
strong
our
own
feelings
have
been
we
should
bow
to
the
conviction
of
others
who
but
he
was
promulgating
a
doctrine
which
her
conscience
required
her
to
stop
at
once
conviction
of
others
shall
never
have
weight
with
me
when
the
welfare
of
my
eternal
soul
is
at
stake
am
speaking
of
those
who
have
had
better
means
of
getting
at
the
truth
than
have
come
within
our
reach
the
secretary
of
state
can
have
no
bias
of
his
own
in
the
matter
is
i
fear
a
godless
man
living
and
dealing
with
the
godless
did
i
not
hear
the
other
day
that
the
great
ministers
of
state
will
not
even
give
a
moment
to
attend
to
the
short
meaningless
prayers
which
are
read
in
the
house
of
commons
one
continued
robert
bolton
trying
to
get
away
from
sentiment
into
real
argument
one
can
have
been
more
intent
on
separating
them
than
william
was
when
he
thought
that
the
evidence
was
against
him
now
he
thinks
the
evidence
in
his
favour
i
know
no
man
whose
head
is
clearer
than
my
brother
i
am
not
very
fond
of
john
caldigate
am
i
said
the
woman
with
an
energy
which
betrayed
much
of
her
true
feeling
if
it
be
the
case
that
they
are
in
truth
man
and
wife
the
sight
of
god
they
are
not
so
she
said
he
continued
trying
to
put
aside
her
interruption
and
to
go
on
with
the
assertion
he
had
commenced
must
be
our
duty
to
acknowledge
him
for
her
sake
were
we
not
to
do
so
we
should
stand
condemned
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
world
cares
for
the
opinion
of
the
world
we
should
destroy
her
happiness
happiness
here
on
earth
what
does
that
matter
there
is
no
such
happiness
it
was
a
very
hard
fight
but
perhaps
not
harder
than
he
had
expected
he
had
known
that
she
would
not
listen
to
reason
that
she
would
not
even
attempt
to
understand
it
and
he
had
learned
before
this
how
impregnable
was
that
will
of
fanaticism
in
which
she
would
entrench
herself
how
improbable
it
was
that
she
would
capitulate
under
the
force
of
any
argument
but
he
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
move
his
father
to
assert
himself
he
was
well
aware
that
in
the
midst
of
that
apparent
lethargy
his
father
mind
was
at
work
with
much
of
its
old
energy
he
understood
the
physical
infirmities
and
religious
vacillation
which
combined
had
brought
the
old
man
into
his
present
state
of
apparent
submission
it
was
hardly
two
years
since
the
same
thing
had
been
done
in
regard
to
hester
marriage
then
bolton
had
asserted
himself
and
declared
his
will
in
opposition
to
his
wife
there
had
indeed
been
much
change
in
him
since
that
time
but
still
something
of
the
old
fire
remained
have
thought
it
to
be
my
duty
sir
he
said
make
known
to
you
william
opinion
and
my
own
i
say
nothing
as
to
social
intercourse
that
must
be
left
to
yourself
but
if
this
pardon
be
granted
you
will
i
think
be
bound
to
acknowledge
john
caldigate
to
be
your
father
agrees
with
me
said
bolton
rising
from
her
chair
and
speaking
in
an
angry
tone
hope
you
both
will
agree
with
me
as
soon
as
tidings
of
the
pardon
reach
you
you
should
i
think
intimate
to
hester
that
you
accept
her
marriage
as
having
been
true
and
legal
i
shall
do
so
even
though
i
should
never
see
him
in
my
house
again
of
course
will
do
as
you
please
you
sir
he
said
appealing
to
the
old
man
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
your
father
said
the
wife
angrily
has
always
encouraged
me
to
offer
him
my
advice
then
bolton
shuffled
in
his
chair
as
though
collecting
himself
for
an
effort
and
at
last
sat
up
with
his
head
however
bent
forward
and
with
both
his
arms
resting
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
though
he
looked
to
be
old
much
older
than
he
was
still
there
was
a
gleam
of
fire
in
his
eye
he
was
thin
almost
emaciated
and
his
head
hung
forward
as
though
there
were
not
strength
left
in
his
spine
for
him
to
sit
erect
hope
sir
you
do
not
think
that
i
have
gone
beyond
my
duty
in
what
i
have
said
shall
come
here
muttered
the
old
man
she
shall
said
bolton
she
will
do
you
suppose
that
i
do
not
long
to
have
my
own
child
in
my
arms
shall
come
here
and
be
called
by
her
name
said
the
father
shall
be
hester
my
own
hester
said
the
mother
not
feeling
herself
as
yet
called
upon
to
contradict
her
husband
john
caldigate
shall
come
he
said
exclaimed
bolton
shall
be
asked
to
come
i
say
he
shall
am
i
to
be
harder
on
my
own
child
than
are
all
the
others
shall
i
call
her
a
castaway
when
others
say
that
she
is
an
honest
married
woman
has
called
her
a
castaway
took
the
verdict
of
the
jury
though
it
broke
my
heart
he
continued
broke
my
heart
to
be
told
that
my
girl
and
her
child
were
nameless
but
i
believed
it
because
the
jury
said
so
and
because
the
judge
declared
it
when
they
tell
me
the
contrary
why
shall
i
not
believe
that
i
do
believe
it
and
she
shall
come
here
if
she
will
and
he
shall
come
then
he
got
up
and
slowly
moved
out
of
the
room
so
that
there
might
be
no
further
argument
on
the
subject
she
had
reseated
herself
with
her
arms
crossed
and
there
sat
perfectly
mute
robert
bolton
stood
up
and
repeated
all
his
arguments
appealing
even
to
her
maternal
love
but
she
answered
him
never
a
word
she
had
not
even
yet
succeeded
in
making
the
companion
of
her
life
submissive
to
her
that
was
the
feeling
which
was
now
uppermost
in
her
mind
he
had
said
that
caldigate
should
be
asked
to
the
house
and
should
be
acknowledged
throughout
all
cambridge
as
his
and
having
said
it
he
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
she
was
sure
of
that
of
what
avail
had
been
all
the
labour
of
her
life
with
such
a
result
hope
you
will
think
that
i
have
done
no
more
than
my
duty
said
robert
bolton
offering
her
his
hand
but
there
she
sat
perfectly
silent
with
her
arms
still
folded
and
would
take
no
notice
of
him
said
he
striving
to
put
something
of
the
softness
of
affection
into
his
voice
but
she
would
not
even
bend
her
head
to
him
and
thus
he
left
her
she
remained
motionless
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
then
she
got
up
and
according
to
her
daily
custom
walked
a
certain
number
of
times
round
the
garden
her
mind
was
so
full
that
she
did
not
as
usual
observe
every
twig
almost
every
leaf
as
she
passed
nor
now
that
she
was
alone
was
that
religious
bias
which
had
so
much
to
do
with
her
daily
life
very
strong
within
her
there
was
no
taint
of
hypocrisy
in
her
character
but
yet
with
the
force
of
human
disappointment
heavy
upon
her
her
heart
was
now
hot
with
human
anger
and
mutinous
with
human
resolves
she
had
proposed
to
herself
to
revenge
herself
upon
the
men
of
her
family
upon
the
men
who
had
contrived
that
marriage
for
her
daughter
by
devoting
herself
to
the
care
of
that
daughter
and
her
nameless
grandson
and
by
letting
it
be
known
to
all
that
the
misery
of
their
condition
would
have
been
spared
had
her
word
prevailed
that
they
should
live
together
a
stern
dark
but
still
sympathetic
life
secluded
within
the
high
walls
of
that
lonely
abode
and
that
she
should
thus
be
able
to
prove
how
right
she
had
been
how
wicked
and
calamitous
their
interference
with
her
child
that
had
been
the
scheme
of
her
life
and
now
her
scheme
was
knocked
on
the
head
and
hester
was
to
become
a
prosperous
ordinary
married
woman
amidst
the
fatness
of
the
land
at
folking
it
was
all
wormwood
to
her
but
still
as
she
walked
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
as
that
old
man
had
said
so
so
it
must
be
with
all
her
labour
with
all
her
care
and
with
all
her
strength
she
had
not
succeeded
in
becoming
the
master
of
that
weak
old
man
chapter
lxi
the
news
reaches
cambridge
the
tidings
of
john
caldigate
pardon
reached
cambridge
on
the
saturday
morning
and
was
communicated
in
various
shapes
official
letters
from
the
home
office
were
written
to
the
governor
of
the
jail
and
to
the
to
seely
who
was
still
acting
as
attorney
on
behalf
of
the
prisoner
and
to
caldigate
himself
the
latter
was
longer
than
the
others
and
contained
a
gracious
expression
of
her
majesty
regret
that
he
as
an
innocent
person
should
have
been
subjected
to
imprisonment
the
secretary
of
state
also
was
described
as
being
keenly
sensible
of
the
injustice
which
had
been
perpetrated
by
the
unfortunate
and
most
unusual
circumstances
of
the
case
as
the
home
office
had
decided
that
the
man
was
to
be
considered
innocent
it
decided
also
on
the
expression
of
its
opinion
without
a
shadow
of
remaining
doubt
and
the
news
reached
cambridge
in
other
ways
by
the
same
post
william
bolton
wrote
both
to
his
father
and
brother
and
brown
the
sent
a
private
letter
to
the
old
squire
at
folking
of
which
further
mention
shall
be
made
before
church
time
on
the
sunday
morning
the
fact
that
john
caldigate
was
to
be
released
or
had
been
released
from
prison
was
known
to
all
cambridge
caldigate
himself
had
borne
his
imprisonment
on
the
whole
well
he
had
complained
but
little
to
those
around
him
and
had
at
once
resolved
to
endure
the
slowly
passing
two
years
with
silent
fortitude
as
a
brave
man
will
resolve
to
bear
any
evil
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
but
a
more
wretched
man
than
he
was
after
the
first
week
of
bitterness
could
hardly
be
found
fortitude
has
no
effect
in
abating
such
misery
other
than
what
may
come
from
an
absence
of
fretful
impatience
the
man
who
endures
all
that
the
tormentors
can
do
to
him
without
a
sign
simply
refuses
to
acknowledge
the
agonies
inflicted
so
it
was
with
caldigate
though
he
obeyed
with
placid
readiness
all
the
prison
instructions
and
composed
his
features
and
seemed
almost
to
smile
when
that
which
was
to
be
exacted
from
him
was
explained
he
ate
his
heart
in
dismay
as
he
counted
the
days
the
hours
the
minutes
and
then
calculated
the
amount
of
misery
that
was
in
store
for
him
and
there
was
so
much
more
for
him
to
think
of
than
his
own
condition
he
knew
of
course
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
him
but
would
it
not
be
the
same
to
his
wife
and
child
as
though
he
had
been
in
truth
guilty
would
not
his
boy
to
his
dying
day
be
regarded
as
illegitimate
and
though
he
had
been
wrongly
condemned
had
not
all
this
come
in
truth
from
his
own
fault
and
when
that
eternity
of
misery
within
the
prison
walls
should
have
come
to
an
end
if
he
could
live
through
it
so
as
to
see
the
end
of
it
what
would
then
be
his
fate
and
what
his
duty
he
had
perfect
trust
in
his
wife
but
who
could
say
what
two
years
might
do
two
years
during
which
she
would
be
subjected
to
the
pressure
of
all
her
friends
where
should
he
find
her
when
the
months
had
passed
and
if
she
were
no
longer
at
folking
would
she
come
back
to
him
he
was
sure
nearly
sure
that
he
could
not
claim
her
as
his
wife
and
were
she
still
minded
to
share
her
future
lot
with
him
in
what
way
should
he
treat
her
if
that
horrid
woman
was
his
wife
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
he
feared
though
hardly
knew
that
it
would
be
so
then
could
not
that
other
one
who
was
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
own
soul
be
his
wife
also
what
would
become
of
his
child
who
as
far
as
he
could
see
would
not
be
his
child
at
all
in
the
eye
of
the
law
even
while
he
was
still
a
free
man
still
uncondemned
an
effort
had
been
made
to
rob
him
of
his
wife
and
boy
an
effort
which
for
a
time
had
seemed
to
be
successful
how
would
hester
be
able
to
withstand
such
attempts
when
they
would
be
justified
by
a
legal
decision
that
she
was
not
his
wife
and
could
not
become
his
wife
while
that
other
woman
was
alive
such
thoughts
as
these
did
not
tend
to
relieve
the
weariness
of
his
days
the
only
person
from
the
outside
world
whom
he
was
allowed
to
see
during
the
three
months
of
his
incarceration
was
seely
and
with
him
he
had
two
interviews
from
the
time
of
the
verdict
seely
was
still
engaged
in
making
those
enquiries
as
to
the
evidence
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
and
though
he
was
altogether
unsympathetic
and
incredulous
still
he
did
his
duty
he
had
told
his
client
that
these
enquiries
were
being
made
and
had
on
his
second
visit
informed
him
of
the
arrival
of
dick
shand
but
he
had
never
spoken
with
hope
and
had
almost
ridiculed
bagwax
with
his
and
postmarks
when
caldigate
first
heard
that
dick
was
in
england
for
a
minute
or
two
he
allowed
himself
to
be
full
of
hope
but
the
attorney
had
dashed
his
hopes
what
was
evidence
against
the
testimony
of
four
witnesses
who
had
borne
the
fire
of
their
character
was
not
very
good
but
dick
was
if
possible
worse
seely
did
not
think
that
dick
word
would
go
for
much
he
could
simply
say
that
as
far
as
he
knew
there
had
been
no
marriage
and
in
this
seely
had
been
right
for
dick
word
had
not
gone
for
much
then
when
crinkett
and
smith
had
been
arrested
no
tidings
had
reached
him
of
that
further
event
it
had
been
thought
best
that
nothing
as
to
that
should
be
communicated
to
him
till
the
result
should
be
known
thus
it
had
come
to
pass
that
when
the
tidings
reached
the
prison
he
was
not
in
a
state
of
expectation
the
governor
of
the
prison
knew
what
was
going
on
and
had
for
days
been
looking
for
the
order
of
release
but
he
had
not
held
himself
to
be
justified
in
acquainting
his
prisoner
with
the
facts
the
despatches
to
him
and
to
caldigate
from
the
home
office
were
marked
immediate
and
by
the
courtesy
of
the
postmaster
were
given
in
at
the
prison
gates
before
daylight
caldigate
was
still
asleep
when
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
by
the
governor
in
person
and
the
communication
was
made
to
him
as
he
lay
for
the
last
time
stretched
on
his
prison
pallet
can
get
up
a
free
man
caldigate
said
the
governor
with
his
hand
on
his
prisoner
shoulder
have
here
the
queen
pardon
it
has
reached
me
this
morning
caldigate
got
up
and
looked
at
the
man
as
though
he
did
not
at
first
understand
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
is
true
caldigate
here
is
my
authority
and
this
no
doubt
is
a
communication
of
the
same
nature
to
yourself
then
caldigate
took
the
letter
and
with
his
mind
still
bewildered
made
himself
acquainted
with
the
gratifying
fact
that
all
the
were
very
sorry
for
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
him
in
his
state
of
mind
as
it
then
was
he
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
think
much
of
the
injustice
done
to
him
he
had
in
store
for
him
for
immediate
use
a
whole
world
of
glorious
bliss
there
was
his
house
his
property
his
farm
his
garden
and
the
free
air
and
there
would
be
the
knowledge
of
all
those
around
him
that
he
had
not
done
the
treacherous
thing
of
which
those
wretches
had
accused
him
and
added
to
all
this
and
above
all
this
there
would
be
his
wife
and
his
child
it
was
odd
enough
that
a
word
from
the
mouth
of
an
exalted
parliamentary
personage
should
be
able
to
give
him
back
one
wife
and
release
him
from
another
in
opposition
to
the
decision
of
the
law
should
avail
to
restore
to
his
boy
the
name
and
birthright
of
which
he
had
been
practically
deprived
and
should
by
a
stroke
of
his
pen
undo
all
that
had
been
done
by
the
combined
efforts
of
jury
judge
and
prosecutor
but
he
found
that
so
it
was
he
was
pardoned
forsooth
as
though
he
were
still
a
guilty
man
yet
he
would
have
back
his
wife
and
child
and
no
one
could
gainsay
him
can
i
go
he
said
jumping
from
his
bed
you
please
now
at
once
but
you
had
better
come
into
the
house
and
breakfast
with
me
first
i
may
i
would
rather
go
instantly
can
you
send
for
a
carriage
for
me
then
the
governor
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
that
it
would
be
better
for
his
wife
and
more
comfortable
for
everybody
concerned
that
she
should
have
been
enabled
to
expect
him
if
it
were
only
for
an
hour
or
two
before
his
arrival
a
communication
would
doubtless
have
been
made
from
the
home
office
to
some
one
at
folking
and
as
that
would
be
sent
out
by
the
it
would
not
be
received
before
nine
in
the
morning
but
caldigate
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
persuaded
as
for
eating
before
he
had
seen
the
dear
ones
at
home
that
he
declared
to
be
impossible
a
vision
of
what
that
breakfast
might
be
to
him
with
his
own
wife
at
his
side
came
before
his
eyes
and
therefore
a
messenger
was
at
once
sent
for
the
vehicle
but
the
postmaster
who
from
the
beginning
had
never
been
a
believer
in
the
australian
wife
and
being
a
liberal
was
staunch
to
the
caldigate
side
of
the
question
would
not
allow
the
letter
addressed
to
the
old
squire
to
be
retained
for
the
slow
operations
of
the
regular
messenger
but
sent
it
off
manfully
by
horse
express
before
the
dawn
of
day
so
that
it
reached
the
old
squire
almost
as
soon
as
the
other
letters
reached
the
prison
the
squire
who
was
an
early
man
was
shaving
himself
when
the
despatch
was
brought
into
his
room
with
an
intimation
that
the
boy
on
horseback
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
to
do
next
the
boy
of
course
got
his
breakfast
and
caldigate
read
his
letter
which
was
as
follows
office
dear
sir
when
you
did
me
the
honour
of
calling
upon
me
here
i
was
able
to
do
no
more
than
express
my
sympathy
as
to
the
misfortune
which
had
fallen
upon
your
family
and
to
explain
to
you
i
fear
not
very
efficiently
that
at
that
moment
the
mouths
of
all
of
us
here
were
stopped
by
official
prudence
as
to
the
matter
which
was
naturally
so
near
your
heart
i
have
now
the
very
great
pleasure
of
informing
you
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
this
morning
received
her
majesty
command
to
issue
a
pardon
for
your
son
the
official
intimation
will
be
sent
to
him
and
to
the
county
authorities
by
this
post
and
by
the
time
that
this
reaches
you
he
will
be
a
free
man
writing
to
you
i
need
hardly
explain
that
the
form
of
a
pardon
from
the
throne
is
the
only
mode
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
country
for
setting
aside
a
verdict
which
has
been
found
in
error
upon
false
evidence
unfortunately
perhaps
we
have
not
the
means
of
annulling
a
criminal
conviction
by
a
second
trial
and
therefore
on
such
occasions
as
this
occasions
which
are
very
rare
we
have
but
this
lame
way
of
redressing
a
great
grievance
i
am
happy
to
think
that
in
this
case
the
future
effect
will
be
as
complete
as
though
the
verdict
had
been
reversed
as
to
the
suffering
which
has
been
already
endured
by
your
son
by
his
wife
and
by
yourself
i
am
aware
that
no
redress
can
be
given
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
honest
and
good
have
to
endure
a
portion
of
the
evil
produced
by
the
dishonesty
of
the
wicked
i
can
only
add
to
this
my
best
wishes
for
your
happiness
on
his
return
to
his
home
and
express
a
hope
that
you
will
understand
that
i
would
most
willingly
have
made
your
visit
to
the
home
office
more
satisfactory
had
it
been
within
my
power
to
do
believe
me
very
faithfully
yours
brown
he
had
not
read
this
letter
to
the
end
and
had
hardly
washed
the
soap
from
his
face
before
he
was
in
his
room
she
was
there
with
her
child
still
in
bed
thinking
thinking
thinking
whether
there
would
ever
come
an
end
to
her
misery
has
come
said
the
old
man
has
come
she
asked
jumping
up
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
but
she
knew
what
had
come
for
he
had
the
letter
open
in
his
hands
have
pardoned
him
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
pardoning
a
man
whom
they
know
to
be
innocent
and
to
have
been
injured
but
the
of
the
thing
as
the
old
squire
very
naturally
called
it
was
nothing
to
her
now
he
was
to
come
back
to
her
she
would
be
in
his
arms
that
day
on
that
very
day
she
would
once
again
hold
up
her
boy
to
be
kissed
by
his
father
is
he
when
will
he
come
of
course
i
will
go
to
him
you
will
make
them
have
the
waggonnette
at
once
will
you
not
i
will
be
dressed
in
five
minutes
if
you
will
go
of
course
i
will
go
to
fetch
him
but
this
the
squire
would
not
allow
the
carriage
should
be
sent
of
course
and
if
it
met
his
son
on
the
road
as
was
probable
there
would
be
no
harm
done
but
it
would
not
be
well
that
the
greeting
between
the
husband
and
the
wife
should
be
in
public
so
he
went
out
to
order
the
carriage
and
to
prepare
himself
to
accompany
it
leaving
her
to
think
of
her
happiness
and
to
make
herself
ready
for
the
meeting
but
when
left
to
herself
she
could
hardly
compose
herself
so
as
to
brush
her
hair
and
give
herself
those
little
graces
which
should
be
pleasant
to
his
eye
is
coming
she
said
to
her
boy
over
and
over
again
is
coming
back
papa
will
be
here
your
own
own
own
papa
then
she
threw
aside
the
black
gown
which
she
had
worn
since
he
left
her
and
chose
for
her
wear
one
which
he
himself
had
taken
pride
in
buying
for
her
the
first
article
of
her
dress
in
the
choice
of
which
he
had
been
consulted
as
her
husband
and
with
quick
unsteady
hand
she
pulled
out
some
gay
ribbon
for
her
baby
yes
she
and
her
boy
would
once
again
be
bright
for
his
sake
for
his
sake
there
should
again
be
gay
ribbons
and
soft
silks
is
coming
my
own
one
your
own
own
papa
and
then
she
smothered
the
child
with
kisses
while
they
were
sitting
at
breakfast
at
puritan
grange
the
same
news
reached
and
bolton
the
letter
to
the
old
man
from
his
son
in
town
was
very
short
merely
stating
that
the
authorities
at
the
home
office
had
at
last
decided
that
caldigate
should
be
released
from
prison
the
writer
knew
that
his
father
would
be
prepared
for
this
news
by
his
brother
and
all
that
could
be
said
in
the
way
of
argument
had
been
said
already
the
letters
which
came
to
puritan
grange
were
few
in
number
and
were
generally
addressed
to
the
lady
the
banker
letters
were
all
received
at
the
house
of
business
in
the
town
is
it
asked
the
wife
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
long
official
envelope
but
he
read
it
to
the
end
very
slowly
before
he
vouchsafed
her
any
reply
has
to
do
with
that
wretched
man
in
prison
she
said
is
it
is
in
prison
no
longer
have
let
him
escape
queen
has
pardoned
him
because
he
was
not
guilty
queen
as
though
she
could
know
whether
he
be
guilty
or
innocent
what
can
the
queen
know
of
the
manner
of
his
life
in
foreign
parts
before
he
had
taken
my
girl
away
from
me
never
married
the
woman
let
there
be
no
more
said
about
it
he
never
married
her
but
bolton
though
she
was
not
victorious
was
not
to
be
silenced
by
a
single
word
no
more
about
it
indeed
there
must
be
very
much
more
about
it
she
was
not
his
wife
she
was
worse
she
said
has
repented
of
that
she
said
with
scorn
what
very
righteous
person
ever
believed
in
the
repentance
of
an
enemy
should
he
not
repent
has
had
leisure
in
jail
us
hope
that
he
has
used
it
at
any
rate
he
is
her
husband
there
are
not
many
days
left
to
me
here
let
me
at
least
see
my
daughter
during
the
few
that
remain
to
me
i
not
want
to
see
my
own
child
will
see
her
and
her
boy
and
i
will
have
them
called
by
the
name
which
is
theirs
and
he
shall
come
if
he
will
who
are
you
or
who
am
i
that
we
shall
throw
in
his
teeth
the
sins
of
his
youth
then
she
became
sullen
and
there
was
not
a
word
more
said
between
them
that
morning
but
after
breakfast
the
old
gardener
was
sent
into
town
for
a
fly
and
bolton
was
taken
to
the
bank
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
robert
bolton
of
her
husband
when
the
tidings
were
made
known
to
her
also
at
her
must
take
it
as
a
fact
that
she
is
his
wife
course
my
dear
if
the
secretary
of
state
were
to
say
that
i
was
his
wife
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
take
it
as
a
fact
he
said
that
you
were
a
goose
it
might
be
nearer
the
mark
but
a
goose
must
know
what
she
is
to
do
must
write
her
a
letter
and
call
her
caldigate
that
will
be
an
acknowledgment
what
shall
i
say
to
her
her
to
come
here
if
you
will
him
him
too
the
fact
is
we
have
got
to
swallow
it
all
i
was
sure
that
he
had
married
that
woman
and
then
of
course
i
wanted
to
get
hester
away
from
him
now
i
believe
that
he
never
married
her
and
therefore
we
must
make
the
best
of
him
as
hester
husband
used
to
like
him
and
perhaps
i
shall
again
but
why
on
earth
did
he
pay
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
those
miscreants
that
is
what
i
could
not
get
over
it
was
that
which
made
me
sure
he
was
guilty
it
is
that
which
still
puzzles
me
so
that
i
can
hardly
make
up
my
mind
to
be
quite
sure
that
he
is
innocent
but
still
we
have
to
be
sure
perhaps
the
miracle
will
be
explained
some
day
chapter
lxii
john
caldigate
return
the
carriage
started
with
the
old
man
in
it
as
soon
as
the
horses
could
be
harnessed
but
on
the
folking
causeway
it
met
the
fly
which
was
bringing
john
caldigate
to
his
home
so
that
the
father
and
son
greeted
each
other
in
the
street
amidst
the
eyes
of
the
villagers
to
them
it
did
not
much
matter
but
the
squire
had
certainly
been
right
in
saving
hester
from
so
public
a
demonstration
of
her
feelings
the
two
men
said
hardly
a
word
when
they
met
but
stood
there
for
a
moment
grasping
each
other
hands
then
the
driver
of
the
fly
was
paid
and
the
carriage
was
turned
back
to
the
house
she
well
asked
caldigate
will
be
well
now
she
been
ill
has
not
been
very
happy
john
while
you
have
been
away
from
her
the
boy
is
all
right
he
has
been
spared
the
knowledge
of
the
injury
done
to
him
it
has
been
very
bad
with
you
i
suppose
do
not
like
being
in
jail
sir
it
was
the
length
of
the
time
before
me
that
seemed
to
crush
me
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
i
should
live
to
see
the
end
of
it
end
has
come
my
boy
said
his
father
again
taking
him
by
the
hand
the
cruelty
of
the
thing
remains
had
there
been
another
trial
as
soon
as
the
other
evidence
was
obtained
the
struggle
would
have
kept
your
heart
up
it
is
damnable
that
a
man
in
an
office
up
in
london
should
have
to
decide
on
such
a
matter
and
should
be
able
to
take
his
own
time
about
it
the
grievance
was
still
at
the
old
heart
in
spite
of
the
amenity
of
brown
letter
but
john
caldigate
who
was
approaching
his
house
and
his
wife
and
to
whom
after
his
imprisonment
even
the
flat
fields
and
dykes
were
beautiful
did
not
at
the
moment
much
regard
the
anomaly
of
the
machinery
by
which
he
had
been
liberated
hester
in
the
meantime
had
donned
her
silk
dress
and
had
tied
the
gay
bow
round
her
baby
frock
who
was
quite
old
enough
to
be
astonished
and
charmed
by
the
unusual
finery
in
which
he
was
apparelled
then
she
sat
herself
at
the
window
of
a
bedroom
which
looked
out
on
to
the
gravel
sweep
with
her
boy
on
her
lap
and
there
she
was
determined
to
wait
till
the
carriage
should
come
but
she
had
hardly
seated
herself
before
she
heard
the
wheels
is
here
he
is
coming
there
he
is
she
said
to
the
child
look
it
is
papa
but
she
stood
back
from
the
window
that
she
might
not
be
seen
she
had
thought
it
out
with
many
fluctuations
as
to
the
very
spot
in
which
she
would
meet
him
at
one
moment
she
had
intended
to
go
down
to
the
gate
then
to
the
and
again
she
had
determined
that
she
would
wait
for
him
in
the
room
in
which
his
breakfast
was
prepared
for
him
but
she
had
ordered
it
otherwise
at
last
when
she
saw
the
carriage
approaching
she
retreated
back
from
the
window
so
that
he
should
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
but
she
had
seen
him
as
he
sat
still
holding
his
father
hand
then
she
ran
back
to
her
own
chamber
and
gave
her
orders
as
she
passed
across
the
passage
down
nurse
and
tell
him
that
i
am
here
run
quick
nurse
tell
him
to
come
at
once
but
he
needed
no
telling
whether
he
had
divined
her
purpose
or
whether
it
was
natural
to
him
to
fly
like
a
bird
to
his
nest
he
rushed
upstairs
and
was
in
the
room
almost
before
his
father
had
left
the
carriage
she
had
the
child
in
her
hands
when
she
heard
him
turn
the
lock
of
the
door
but
before
he
entered
the
boy
had
been
laid
in
his
cradle
and
then
she
was
in
his
arms
for
the
first
few
minutes
she
was
quite
collected
not
saying
much
but
answering
his
questions
by
a
word
or
two
oh
yes
she
was
well
and
baby
was
well
quite
well
he
too
looked
well
she
said
though
there
was
something
of
sadness
in
his
face
i
will
kiss
that
away
so
soon
so
soon
she
had
always
expected
that
he
would
come
back
long
long
before
the
time
that
had
been
named
she
had
been
sure
of
it
she
declared
because
that
it
was
impossible
that
so
great
injustice
should
be
done
but
the
last
fortnight
had
been
very
long
when
those
wicked
people
had
been
put
in
prison
she
had
thought
that
then
surely
he
would
come
but
now
he
was
there
with
his
arms
round
her
safe
in
his
own
home
and
everything
was
well
then
she
lifted
the
baby
up
to
be
kissed
again
and
again
and
began
to
dance
and
spring
in
her
joy
then
suddenly
she
almost
threw
the
child
into
his
arms
and
seated
herself
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
began
to
sob
with
violence
when
he
asked
her
with
much
embracing
to
compose
herself
sitting
close
to
her
kissing
her
again
and
again
she
shook
her
head
as
it
lay
upon
his
shoulder
and
then
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
laughter
does
it
matter
she
said
after
a
while
as
he
knelt
at
her
knees
does
it
matter
my
boy
father
has
come
back
to
him
my
boy
has
got
his
own
name
and
he
is
an
honest
true
caldigate
and
no
one
again
will
tell
me
that
another
woman
owns
my
husband
my
own
husband
the
father
of
my
boy
it
almost
killed
me
john
when
they
said
that
you
were
not
mine
and
yet
i
knew
that
they
said
it
falsely
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
i
knew
that
you
were
my
own
and
that
my
boy
had
a
right
to
his
name
but
it
was
hard
to
hear
them
say
so
john
it
was
hard
to
bear
when
my
mother
swore
that
it
was
so
at
last
they
went
down
and
found
the
old
squire
waiting
for
his
breakfast
should
think
said
he
you
would
be
glad
to
see
a
loaf
of
bread
on
a
clean
board
again
and
to
know
that
you
may
cut
it
as
you
please
did
they
give
you
enough
where
you
were
did
think
much
about
it
sir
you
must
think
about
it
now
said
hester
please
me
you
must
like
everything
your
tea
and
your
fresh
eggs
and
the
butter
and
the
cream
you
must
let
yourself
be
spoilt
for
a
time
just
to
compensate
me
for
your
absence
have
made
yourself
smart
to
receive
him
at
any
rate
said
the
squire
who
had
become
thoroughly
used
to
the
black
gown
which
she
had
worn
morning
noon
and
evening
while
her
husband
was
away
should
i
not
be
smart
she
said
my
man
has
come
to
me
for
whose
eyes
shall
i
put
on
the
raiment
that
is
his
own
but
for
his
i
was
much
lower
than
a
widow
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
but
now
i
have
got
my
husband
back
again
and
my
boy
shall
wear
the
very
best
that
he
has
so
that
his
father
may
see
him
smile
at
his
own
gaudiness
yes
father
i
may
be
smart
now
there
were
moments
in
which
i
thought
that
i
might
never
wear
more
the
pretty
things
which
he
had
given
me
then
she
rose
from
her
seat
again
and
hung
on
his
neck
and
wept
and
sobbed
till
he
feared
that
her
would
break
with
joy
so
the
morning
passed
away
among
them
till
about
eleven
when
the
servant
brought
in
word
that
holt
and
one
or
two
other
of
the
tenants
wanted
to
see
the
young
master
the
squire
had
been
sitting
alone
in
the
back
room
so
that
the
husband
and
wife
might
be
left
together
but
he
had
heard
voices
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
he
now
came
through
to
ask
hester
whether
the
visitors
should
be
sent
away
for
the
present
but
hester
would
not
have
turned
a
dog
from
the
door
which
had
been
true
to
her
husband
through
his
troubles
them
come
she
said
have
been
so
good
to
me
john
through
it
all
they
have
always
known
that
baby
was
a
true
caldigate
holt
and
the
other
farmers
were
shown
into
the
room
and
holt
as
a
matter
of
course
became
the
spokesman
when
caldigate
had
shaken
hands
with
them
all
round
each
muttering
his
word
of
welcome
then
holt
began
wish
you
to
know
squoire
that
we
none
of
us
ai
been
comfortable
in
our
minds
here
at
folking
since
that
crawling
villain
crinkett
came
and
showed
himself
at
our
young
squire
christening
we
ai
said
timothy
purvidge
another
netherden
farmer
have
had
much
comfort
since
that
day
myself
purvidge
said
caldigate
till
this
morning
yet
have
none
of
us
continued
holt
very
impressively
knowed
as
you
had
done
all
right
we
was
as
sure
as
the
church
tower
lord
love
you
sir
when
it
was
between
our
young
missus
excuse
me
for
noticing
these
bright
colours
and
for
saying
how
glad
i
am
to
see
her
come
out
once
again
as
our
squire
wife
should
come
out
between
her
and
that
bedangled
woman
as
i
seed
in
the
court
it
did
take
no
one
long
to
know
what
was
the
truth
the
eloquence
here
was
no
doubt
better
than
the
argument
as
caldigate
must
have
felt
when
he
remembered
how
fond
he
had
once
been
of
that
woman
hester
who
though
she
knew
the
whole
story
did
not
at
this
moment
join
two
and
two
together
thought
that
holt
put
the
case
uncommonly
well
we
knew
he
continued
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
jury
were
netherden
men
nor
yet
utterden
halfacre
he
added
turning
to
a
tenant
from
the
other
parish
they
could
tell
how
it
all
was
as
we
could
and
there
was
that
judge
who
would
have
believed
any
miscreant
as
could
be
got
anywhere
to
swear
away
a
liberty
or
his
wife
and
family
which
is
worse
we
saw
how
it
was
to
be
when
he
first
looked
out
of
his
eye
at
the
two
gents
and
others
who
spoke
up
for
the
young
squoire
it
was
to
be
guilty
we
know
it
but
it
did
any
way
change
our
minds
as
to
crinkett
and
smith
and
them
others
we
saw
that
they
were
ruffians
we
never
doubted
that
but
we
saw
as
there
was
a
bad
time
coming
to
you
john
then
we
was
unhappy
unhappy
along
of
you
john
but
worse
as
to
this
dear
lady
and
the
boy
missus
cried
that
you
would
have
believed
said
purvidge
if
that
true
said
my
missus
she
ai
nobody
and
it
my
belief
she
as
true
a
wife
as
ever
stretched
herself
aside
her
husband
then
hester
bethought
herself
what
present
of
all
presents
would
be
most
acceptable
to
purvidge
who
was
a
old
woman
peculiarly
famous
for
making
cheeses
all
knew
it
said
holt
slapping
his
thigh
with
great
energy
now
in
spite
of
all
judge
jury
and
lying
witnesses
the
king
has
got
his
own
again
at
this
piece
of
triumphant
rhetoric
there
was
a
cheer
from
all
the
farmers
so
we
have
come
to
wish
you
all
joy
and
particularly
you
with
your
boy
things
have
been
said
of
you
hard
to
bear
no
doubt
but
not
a
word
of
the
kind
at
folking
nor
yet
in
netherden
nor
yet
at
utterden
halfacre
but
all
this
is
over
and
we
do
hope
that
you
and
the
young
squoire
live
long
and
the
young
of
all
long
after
we
are
gone
to
our
rest
and
that
you
be
as
fond
of
folking
as
folking
is
of
you
i
ca
say
no
fairer
then
the
tray
was
brought
in
with
wine
and
everybody
drank
everybody
health
and
there
was
another
shaking
of
hands
all
round
purvidge
it
was
observed
drank
the
health
of
every
separate
member
of
the
family
in
a
separate
bumper
pressing
the
edge
of
the
glass
securely
to
his
lips
and
then
sending
the
whole
contents
down
his
throat
at
one
throw
with
a
chuck
from
his
little
finger
the
two
caldigates
went
out
to
see
their
friends
as
far
as
the
gate
and
while
they
were
still
within
the
grounds
there
came
a
merry
peal
from
the
bells
of
netherden
knew
they
be
at
it
said
holt
quite
right
too
said
halfacre
rung
over
at
utterden
only
we
got
nothing
but
that
little
tinkling
thing
as
is
more
fitter
to
swing
round
a
bullock
neck
than
on
a
told
as
they
should
have
beer
said
brownby
whose
house
stood
on
folking
causeway
they
shall
have
beer
brownby
was
a
silent
man
and
added
nothing
to
this
one
pertinent
remark
to
beer
said
halfacre
found
the
beer
at
utterden
there
would
have
been
no
grudging
the
beer
brownby
no
more
than
there
is
in
the
lower
parish
but
you
ca
get
up
a
peal
merely
on
beer
you
got
to
have
bells
while
they
were
still
standing
at
the
gate
bromley
the
clergyman
joined
them
and
walked
back
towards
the
house
with
the
two
caldigates
he
too
had
come
to
offer
his
congratulations
and
to
assure
the
released
prisoner
that
he
never
believed
the
imputed
guilt
but
he
would
not
go
into
the
house
surmising
that
on
such
a
day
the
happy
wife
would
not
care
to
see
many
visitors
but
caldigate
asked
him
to
take
a
turn
about
the
grounds
being
anxious
to
learn
something
from
the
outside
world
do
they
say
to
it
all
at
babington
think
they
a
little
divided
aunt
has
been
against
me
of
course
first
she
was
i
fancy
it
was
natural
that
people
should
believe
till
shand
came
back
dear
old
dick
i
must
look
after
dick
what
about
julia
injuria
formæ
said
bromley
were
you
to
expect
forgive
her
and
smirkie
i
do
think
smirkie
ever
looked
on
me
with
favourable
eyes
then
the
clergyman
was
forced
to
own
that
smirkie
too
had
been
among
those
who
had
believed
the
woman
story
you
have
to
remember
how
natural
it
is
that
a
man
should
think
a
verdict
to
be
right
in
our
country
a
wrong
verdict
is
an
uncommon
occurrence
it
requires
close
personal
acquaintance
and
much
personal
confidence
to
justify
a
man
in
supposing
that
twelve
jurymen
should
come
to
an
erroneous
decision
i
thought
that
they
were
wrong
but
still
i
knew
that
i
could
hardly
defend
my
opinion
before
the
outside
world
is
all
true
said
caldigate
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
i
will
be
angry
with
no
one
who
will
begin
to
believe
me
innocent
from
this
day
his
mind
however
was
considerably
exercised
in
regard
to
the
boltons
as
to
whom
he
feared
that
they
would
not
even
yet
allow
themselves
to
be
convinced
for
his
wife
happiness
their
conversion
was
of
infinitely
more
importance
than
that
of
all
the
outside
world
beyond
when
the
gloom
of
the
evening
had
come
she
too
came
out
and
walked
with
him
about
the
garden
and
grounds
with
the
professed
object
of
showing
him
whatever
little
changes
might
have
been
made
but
the
conversation
soon
fell
back
upon
the
last
great
incident
of
their
joint
lives
your
mother
can
not
refuse
to
believe
what
everybody
now
declares
to
be
true
he
argued
is
so
strong
in
her
feelings
must
know
they
would
not
have
let
me
out
of
prison
in
opposition
to
the
verdict
until
they
were
very
sure
of
what
they
were
doing
then
she
told
him
all
that
had
occurred
between
her
and
her
mother
since
the
trial
how
her
mother
had
come
out
to
folking
and
had
implored
her
to
return
to
chesterton
and
had
then
taken
herself
away
in
dudgeon
because
she
had
not
prevailed
nothing
would
have
made
me
leave
the
place
she
said
what
they
tried
to
do
when
i
was
there
before
except
to
go
to
church
i
have
not
once
been
outside
the
gate
brothers
will
come
round
i
suppose
robert
has
been
very
angry
with
me
i
know
but
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
man
of
sense
must
take
it
as
it
will
come
john
of
course
it
would
be
very
much
to
me
to
have
my
father
and
mother
restored
to
me
it
would
be
very
much
to
know
that
my
brothers
were
again
my
friends
but
when
i
remember
how
i
prayed
yesterday
but
for
one
thing
and
that
now
that
one
thing
has
come
to
me
how
i
have
got
that
which
when
i
waked
this
morning
seemed
to
me
to
be
all
the
world
to
me
the
want
of
which
made
my
heart
so
sick
that
even
my
baby
could
not
make
me
glad
i
feel
that
nothing
ought
now
to
make
me
unhappy
i
have
got
you
john
and
everything
else
is
nothing
as
he
stooped
in
the
dark
to
kiss
her
again
among
the
he
felt
that
it
was
almost
worth
his
while
to
have
been
in
prison
after
dinner
there
came
a
message
to
them
across
the
ferry
from
holt
would
they
be
so
good
as
to
walk
down
to
the
edge
of
the
great
dike
opposite
to
twopenny
farm
at
nine
as
a
part
of
the
message
holt
sent
word
that
at
that
hour
the
moon
would
be
rising
of
course
they
went
down
to
the
dike
caldigate
john
caldigate
and
hester
there
outside
holt
farmyard
just
far
enough
to
avoid
danger
to
the
and
there
was
blazing
an
enormous
bonfire
all
the
rotten
timber
about
the
place
and
two
or
three
had
been
got
together
and
there
were
collected
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
parishes
the
figures
of
the
boys
and
girls
and
of
the
slow
rustics
with
their
wives
could
be
seen
moving
about
indistinctly
across
the
water
by
the
fluttering
flame
of
the
bonfire
and
their
own
figures
too
were
observed
in
the
moonlight
and
john
caldigate
was
welcomed
back
to
his
home
by
a
loud
cheer
from
all
his
neighbours
did
not
see
much
of
it
myself
holt
said
afterwards
me
and
my
missus
was
busy
among
the
stacks
all
the
time
looking
after
the
sparks
the
bonfire
might
a
been
too
big
you
know
chapter
lxiii
how
bolton
was
quite
conquered
nearly
a
week
passed
over
their
heads
at
puritan
grange
before
anything
further
was
either
done
or
said
or
even
written
as
to
the
return
of
john
caldigate
to
his
own
home
and
to
his
own
wife
in
the
meantime
both
robert
and
daniel
had
gone
out
to
folking
and
made
visits
of
ceremony
visits
which
were
intended
to
signify
their
acknowledgment
that
john
caldigate
was
john
caldigate
with
daniel
the
matter
was
quite
ceremonious
and
short
robert
suggested
something
as
to
a
visit
into
cambridge
saying
that
her
husband
would
be
delighted
if
hester
and
caldigate
would
come
and
dine
and
sleep
hester
immediately
felt
that
something
had
been
gained
but
she
declined
the
proposed
visit
for
the
present
have
both
of
us
she
said
through
so
much
that
we
are
not
quite
fit
to
go
out
anywhere
yet
robert
had
hardly
expected
them
to
come
but
she
had
observed
her
husband
behests
so
far
there
had
been
a
family
reconciliation
during
the
first
few
days
after
the
prisoner
release
but
no
sign
came
from
bolton
and
bolton
though
he
had
given
his
orders
was
not
at
first
urgent
in
requiring
obedience
to
them
then
she
received
a
letter
from
hester
dearest
mamma
of
course
you
know
that
my
darling
husband
has
come
back
to
me
all
i
want
now
to
make
me
quite
happy
is
to
have
you
once
again
as
my
own
own
mother
will
you
not
send
me
a
line
to
say
that
it
shall
all
be
as
though
these
last
long
dreary
months
had
never
been
so
that
i
may
go
to
you
and
show
you
my
baby
once
again
and
dear
mamma
say
one
word
to
me
to
let
me
know
that
you
know
that
he
is
my
husband
tell
papa
to
say
so
your
most
affectionate
daughter
caldigate
bolton
found
this
letter
on
the
lying
as
was
usual
with
her
letters
close
to
her
plate
and
she
read
it
without
saying
a
word
to
her
husband
then
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
still
did
not
say
a
word
before
the
middle
of
the
day
she
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
keep
the
letter
entirely
to
herself
it
was
well
she
thought
that
he
had
not
seen
it
and
no
good
could
be
done
by
showing
it
to
him
but
he
had
been
in
the
before
her
had
seen
the
envelope
and
had
recognised
the
handwriting
they
were
sitting
together
after
lunch
and
she
was
just
about
to
open
the
book
of
sermons
with
which
at
that
time
she
was
regaling
him
when
he
stopped
her
with
a
question
did
hester
say
in
her
letter
even
those
who
intend
to
be
truthful
are
sometimes
surprised
into
a
lie
letter
she
said
but
she
remembered
herself
at
once
and
knew
that
she
could
not
afford
to
be
detected
in
a
falsehood
note
from
hester
yes
i
had
a
note
this
morning
know
you
had
a
note
what
does
she
say
tells
me
that
he
he
has
come
back
what
else
she
was
well
aware
that
we
knew
that
without
her
telling
us
wants
to
come
here
her
come
course
she
shall
come
him
to
this
she
made
no
answer
except
with
the
muscles
of
her
face
which
involuntarily
showed
her
antagonism
to
the
order
she
had
received
her
bring
her
husband
with
her
said
the
banker
would
not
come
though
i
were
to
ask
him
let
it
be
on
his
own
head
will
not
ask
him
she
said
at
last
looking
away
across
the
room
at
the
blank
wall
will
not
belie
my
own
heart
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
here
he
has
so
far
got
the
better
of
me
but
i
will
not
put
my
neck
beneath
his
feet
for
him
to
tread
on
me
then
there
was
a
pause
not
that
he
intended
to
allow
her
disobedience
to
pass
but
that
he
was
driven
to
bethink
himself
how
he
might
best
oppose
her
he
said
can
neither
forgive
nor
forget
has
got
my
child
from
me
my
only
child
he
persecute
your
child
is
she
not
happy
in
his
love
even
if
he
have
trespassed
against
you
who
are
you
that
you
should
not
forgive
a
trespass
i
say
that
he
shall
be
asked
to
come
here
that
men
may
know
that
in
her
own
father
house
she
is
regarded
as
his
true
and
honest
wife
she
murmured
men
may
know
but
she
did
not
again
tell
him
that
she
would
not
obey
his
command
she
sat
all
the
remainder
of
the
day
alone
in
her
room
hardly
touching
the
work
which
she
had
beside
her
not
opening
the
book
which
lay
by
her
hand
on
the
table
she
was
thinking
of
the
letter
which
she
knew
that
she
must
write
but
she
did
not
rise
to
get
pen
and
ink
nor
did
she
even
propose
to
herself
that
the
letter
should
be
written
then
not
a
word
was
said
about
it
all
the
evening
on
the
next
morning
the
banker
pronounced
his
intention
of
going
into
town
but
before
he
started
he
referred
to
the
order
he
had
given
you
written
to
hester
he
asked
she
merely
shook
her
head
write
so
saying
he
tottered
down
the
steps
with
his
stick
and
got
into
the
fly
about
noon
she
did
get
her
paper
and
ink
and
very
slowly
wrote
her
letter
though
her
heart
was
in
truth
yearning
towards
her
daughter
though
at
that
moment
she
could
have
made
any
possible
sacrifice
for
her
child
had
her
child
been
apart
from
the
man
she
hated
she
could
not
in
her
sullenness
force
her
words
into
a
form
of
affection
hester
she
said
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
and
your
boy
on
what
day
would
it
suit
you
to
come
and
how
long
would
you
like
to
stay
i
fear
you
will
find
me
and
your
father
but
dull
companions
after
the
life
you
are
now
used
to
if
caldigate
would
like
to
come
with
you
your
father
bids
me
say
that
he
will
be
glad
to
see
your
loving
mother
bolton
she
endeavoured
in
writing
her
letter
to
obey
the
commands
that
had
been
left
with
her
but
she
could
not
go
nearer
to
it
than
this
she
could
not
so
far
belie
her
heart
as
to
tell
her
daughter
that
she
herself
would
be
glad
to
see
the
man
then
it
took
her
long
to
write
the
address
she
did
write
it
at
last
john
caldigate
folking
but
as
she
wrote
it
she
told
herself
that
she
believed
it
to
be
a
lie
when
the
letter
reached
hester
there
was
a
consultation
over
it
to
which
old
caldigate
was
admitted
it
was
acknowledged
on
all
sides
that
anything
would
be
better
than
a
family
quarrel
the
spirit
in
which
the
invitation
had
been
written
was
to
be
found
in
every
word
of
it
there
was
not
a
word
to
show
that
bolton
had
herself
accepted
the
decision
to
which
everyone
else
had
come
in
the
matter
everything
rather
to
show
that
she
had
not
done
so
but
as
the
squire
said
it
does
not
do
to
inquire
too
closely
into
all
people
inner
beliefs
everybody
were
to
say
what
he
thinks
about
everybody
nobody
would
ever
go
to
see
anybody
it
was
soon
decided
that
hester
with
her
baby
should
go
on
an
early
day
to
puritan
grange
and
should
stay
there
for
a
couple
of
nights
but
there
was
a
difficulty
as
to
caldigate
himself
he
was
naturally
enough
anxious
to
send
hester
without
him
but
she
was
as
anxious
to
take
him
is
for
my
own
sake
she
said
i
shall
like
to
have
you
there
with
me
of
course
it
will
be
very
dull
for
you
but
it
will
be
so
much
better
that
we
should
all
be
reconciled
and
that
everyone
should
know
that
we
are
so
would
only
be
a
pretence
said
he
must
pretend
sometimes
john
she
answered
at
last
it
was
decided
that
he
should
take
her
reaching
the
place
about
the
hour
of
lunch
so
that
he
might
again
break
bread
in
her
father
house
that
he
should
then
leave
her
there
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
two
days
she
should
return
to
folking
on
the
day
named
they
reached
puritan
grange
at
the
hour
fixed
both
caldigate
and
hester
were
very
nervous
as
to
their
reception
and
got
out
of
the
carriage
almost
without
a
word
to
each
other
the
old
gardener
who
had
been
so
busy
during
hester
imprisonment
was
there
to
take
the
luggage
and
hester
maid
carried
the
child
as
caldigate
with
his
wife
behind
him
walked
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
there
was
no
coming
out
to
meet
them
no
greeting
them
even
in
the
hall
bolton
was
perhaps
too
old
and
too
infirm
for
such
running
out
and
it
was
hardly
within
his
nature
to
do
so
they
were
shown
into
the
morning
and
there
they
found
hester
father
in
his
chair
and
bolton
standing
up
to
receive
them
hester
after
kissing
her
father
threw
herself
into
her
mother
arms
before
a
word
had
been
said
to
caldigate
then
the
banker
addressed
him
with
a
set
speech
which
no
doubt
had
been
prepared
in
the
old
mind
am
very
glad
he
said
you
have
brought
this
unhappy
matter
to
so
good
a
conclusion
mr
caldigate
has
been
a
great
trouble
worse
almost
for
hester
than
for
me
it
has
been
sad
enough
for
hester
and
the
more
so
because
it
was
natural
that
others
should
believe
that
which
the
jury
and
the
judge
declared
to
have
been
proved
how
should
any
one
know
otherwise
so
bolton
if
they
will
accept
the
truth
now
i
shall
be
satisfied
will
come
but
perhaps
slowly
to
some
folk
you
should
in
justice
remember
that
your
own
early
follies
have
tended
to
bring
this
all
about
it
was
a
grim
welcome
and
the
last
speech
was
one
which
caldigate
found
it
difficult
to
answer
it
was
so
absolutely
true
that
it
admitted
of
no
answer
he
thought
that
it
might
have
been
spared
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
to
say
that
that
part
of
the
subject
was
one
which
he
did
not
care
to
discuss
hester
heard
it
and
quivered
with
anger
even
in
her
mother
arms
bolton
heard
it
and
in
the
midst
of
her
kisses
made
an
inward
protest
against
the
word
used
follies
indeed
why
had
he
not
spoken
out
the
truth
as
he
knew
it
and
told
the
man
of
his
vices
but
it
was
necessary
that
she
too
should
address
him
hope
i
see
you
quite
well
caldigate
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
prison
has
not
disagreed
with
me
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
it
was
not
an
agreeable
residence
you
used
your
leisure
there
to
meditate
on
your
soul
welfare
it
may
have
been
of
service
to
you
it
was
very
grim
but
the
banker
having
made
his
one
severe
speech
became
kind
in
his
manner
and
almost
genial
he
asked
after
his
future
intentions
and
when
he
was
told
that
they
thought
of
spending
some
months
abroad
so
as
to
rid
themselves
in
that
way
of
the
immediate
record
of
their
past
misery
he
was
gracious
enough
to
express
his
approval
of
the
plan
and
then
when
the
lunch
was
announced
and
the
two
ladies
had
passed
out
of
the
room
he
said
a
word
to
his
in
private
i
was
convinced
caldigate
when
i
first
heard
the
evidence
that
that
other
woman
was
your
wife
and
was
therefore
very
anxious
to
separate
my
daughter
from
you
so
am
i
satisfied
now
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
wicked
plot
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
sir
if
you
please
we
will
go
in
to
lunch
as
long
as
caldigate
remained
in
the
house
bolton
was
almost
silent
the
duties
of
a
hostess
she
performed
in
a
stiff
ungainly
way
she
asked
him
whether
he
would
have
hashed
mutton
or
cold
beef
and
allowed
him
to
pour
a
little
sherry
into
her
but
beyond
this
there
was
not
much
conversation
bolton
had
said
what
he
had
to
say
and
sat
leaning
forward
with
his
chin
over
his
plate
perfectly
silent
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
he
had
some
pleasure
in
having
his
daughter
once
more
beneath
his
roof
especially
as
he
had
implored
his
wife
not
to
deprive
him
of
that
happiness
during
the
small
remainder
of
his
days
but
he
sat
there
with
no
look
of
joy
upon
his
face
that
she
should
be
stern
sullen
and
was
to
be
expected
she
had
been
compelled
to
entertain
their
guest
and
was
not
at
all
the
woman
to
bear
such
compulsion
meekly
the
hour
at
last
wore
itself
away
and
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
caldigate
back
to
folking
was
again
at
the
door
it
was
a
tuesday
will
send
for
me
on
thursday
she
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
after
breakfast
you
know
i
suppose
you
will
not
come
yourself
here
i
think
i
have
done
all
the
good
that
i
can
do
and
it
is
pleasant
to
no
one
but
you
shall
pick
me
up
in
the
town
i
shall
go
in
and
see
your
brother
robert
then
he
went
and
hester
was
left
with
her
parents
as
she
turned
back
from
the
she
found
her
mother
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
waiting
for
her
i
come
with
you
mamma
she
said
holding
each
other
arms
they
went
up
and
so
passed
into
hester
room
where
the
nurse
was
sitting
with
the
boy
her
go
into
my
room
said
the
elder
lady
so
the
nurse
took
the
baby
away
and
they
were
alone
together
hester
hester
my
child
said
the
mother
flinging
her
arms
wildly
round
her
daughter
the
whole
tenor
of
her
face
was
changed
at
that
moment
even
to
hester
she
had
been
stern
forbidding
and
sullen
there
had
not
been
a
gracious
movement
about
her
lips
or
eyes
since
the
visitors
had
come
a
stranger
could
a
stranger
have
seen
it
all
would
have
said
that
the
mother
did
not
love
her
child
that
there
was
no
touch
of
tenderness
about
the
woman
heart
but
now
when
she
was
alone
with
the
one
thing
on
earth
that
was
dear
to
her
she
melted
at
once
in
a
moment
hester
found
herself
seated
on
the
sofa
with
her
mother
kneeling
before
her
sobbing
and
burying
her
face
in
the
loved
one
lap
love
me
hester
still
you
mamma
you
know
i
love
you
as
it
used
to
be
i
am
nothing
to
you
now
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
now
you
turn
away
from
me
because
because
because
have
never
turned
away
from
you
mamma
i
could
not
bear
that
you
should
be
taken
away
from
me
and
given
to
him
is
good
mamma
if
you
would
only
believe
that
he
is
good
is
not
good
god
only
is
good
my
child
is
good
to
me
yes
he
has
taken
you
from
me
when
i
thought
you
were
coming
back
in
trouble
in
disgrace
from
the
world
nameless
a
poor
injured
thing
with
your
nameless
babe
then
i
comforted
myself
because
i
thought
that
i
could
be
all
and
everything
to
you
i
would
have
poured
balm
into
the
hurt
wounds
i
would
have
prayed
with
you
and
you
and
i
would
have
been
as
one
before
the
lord
are
not
sorry
mamma
that
i
have
got
my
husband
again
i
have
tried
i
have
tried
not
to
be
sorry
do
not
believe
now
that
that
woman
was
his
wife
then
the
old
colour
came
back
upon
her
face
and
something
of
the
old
look
and
the
tenderness
was
quenched
in
her
eyes
and
the
softness
of
her
voice
was
gone
do
not
know
she
said
you
must
know
get
up
and
sit
by
me
till
i
tell
you
you
must
teach
yourself
to
know
this
to
be
quite
sure
of
it
you
must
not
think
that
your
daughter
is
is
living
in
adultery
with
the
husband
of
another
woman
to
me
who
knew
him
there
has
never
been
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
not
a
taint
of
fear
to
darken
the
certainty
of
my
faith
it
could
not
have
been
so
perhaps
with
you
who
have
not
known
his
nature
but
now
now
when
all
of
them
from
the
queen
downwards
have
declared
that
this
charge
has
been
a
libel
when
even
the
miscreants
themselves
have
told
against
themselves
when
the
very
judge
has
gone
back
from
the
word
in
which
he
was
so
confident
shall
my
mother
and
my
mother
only
think
that
i
am
a
wretched
miserable
nameless
outcast
with
a
poor
nameless
fatherless
baby
i
am
john
caldigate
wife
before
throne
and
my
child
is
his
child
and
his
lawful
heir
and
owns
his
father
name
my
husband
is
to
me
before
all
the
world
first
best
dearest
my
king
my
man
my
master
and
my
lover
above
all
things
he
is
my
husband
she
had
got
up
and
was
standing
before
her
mother
with
her
arms
folded
before
her
breast
and
the
fire
glanced
from
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
mamma
because
i
love
him
more
i
do
not
love
you
less
yes
oh
yes
so
much
less
mamma
it
is
given
to
us
of
god
so
to
love
our
husband
for
the
husband
is
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
head
of
the
church
you
would
not
have
me
forget
such
teaching
as
that
my
child
no
i
went
out
and
had
him
given
to
me
for
my
husband
of
course
i
loved
him
best
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
aught
but
death
part
him
and
me
but
shall
that
make
my
mother
think
that
her
heart
is
turned
away
from
her
mamma
say
that
he
is
my
husband
the
frown
came
back
and
the
woman
sat
silent
and
sullen
but
there
was
something
of
vacillating
indecision
in
her
face
repeated
hester
that
he
is
my
husband
suppose
so
said
the
woman
very
slowly
say
that
it
is
so
and
bless
your
child
bless
you
my
child
you
know
that
it
is
so
the
word
was
hardly
spoken
but
the
lips
of
the
one
were
close
to
the
ear
of
the
other
and
the
sound
was
heard
and
the
assent
was
acknowledged
chapter
lxiv
conclusion
the
web
of
our
story
has
now
been
woven
the
piece
is
finished
and
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
loose
threads
should
be
collected
so
that
there
may
be
no
unravelling
in
such
chronicles
as
this
something
no
doubt
might
be
left
to
the
imagination
without
serious
injury
to
the
story
but
the
reader
i
think
feels
a
deficiency
when
through
tedium
or
coldness
the
writer
omits
to
give
all
the
information
which
he
possesses
among
the
male
personages
of
my
story
bagwax
should
perhaps
be
allowed
to
stand
first
it
was
his
energy
and
devotion
to
his
peculiar
duties
which
after
the
verdict
served
to
keep
alive
the
idea
that
that
verdict
had
been
unjust
it
was
through
his
ingenuity
that
judge
bramber
was
induced
to
refer
the
inquiry
back
to
scotland
yard
and
in
this
way
to
prevent
the
escape
of
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
therefore
we
will
first
say
a
word
as
to
bagwax
and
his
history
it
was
rumoured
at
the
time
that
sir
john
joram
and
brown
having
met
each
other
at
the
club
after
the
order
for
caldigate
release
had
been
given
and
discussing
the
matter
with
great
interest
united
in
giving
praise
to
bagwax
then
sir
john
told
the
story
of
those
broken
hopes
of
the
man
desire
to
travel
and
of
the
faith
and
honesty
with
which
he
sacrificed
his
own
aspirations
for
the
good
of
the
poor
lady
whose
husband
had
been
so
cruelly
taken
away
from
her
then
as
it
was
said
at
the
time
an
important
letter
was
sent
from
the
home
office
to
the
giving
bagwax
much
praise
and
suggesting
that
a
very
good
thing
would
be
done
to
the
colony
of
new
south
wales
if
that
ingenious
and
skilful
master
of
postmarks
could
be
sent
out
to
sydney
with
the
view
of
setting
matters
straight
in
the
sydney
office
there
was
then
much
correspondence
with
the
colonial
office
which
did
not
at
first
care
very
much
about
bagwax
but
at
last
the
order
was
given
by
the
treasury
and
bagwax
went
there
were
many
tears
shed
on
the
occasion
at
apricot
villa
jemima
curlydown
thought
that
she
also
should
be
allowed
to
see
sydney
and
was
in
favour
of
an
immediate
marriage
with
this
object
but
bagwax
felt
that
the
boisterous
ocean
might
be
unpropitious
to
the
delights
of
a
honeymoon
and
curlydown
reminded
his
daughter
of
all
the
furniture
which
would
thus
be
lost
bagwax
went
as
a
gay
bachelor
and
spent
six
happy
months
in
the
bright
colony
he
did
not
effect
much
as
the
delinquent
who
had
served
crinkett
in
his
base
purposes
had
already
been
detected
and
punished
before
his
arrival
but
he
was
treated
with
extreme
courtesy
by
the
sydney
officials
and
was
able
to
bring
home
with
him
a
treasure
in
the
shape
of
a
manner
of
tying
so
that
when
the
intelligencer
boasted
that
the
great
english
professor
who
had
come
to
instruct
them
all
had
gone
home
instructed
there
was
some
truth
in
it
he
was
married
immediately
after
his
return
and
jemima
his
wife
has
the
advantage
in
her
very
pretty
of
every
shilling
that
he
made
by
the
voyage
my
readers
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
soon
afterwards
he
was
appointed
of
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
the
footnote
i
hope
my
friends
in
the
sydney
will
take
no
offence
should
this
story
ever
reach
their
ears
i
know
how
well
the
duties
are
done
in
that
office
and
between
ourselves
i
think
that
bagwax
journey
was
quite
unnecessary
one
of
the
few
things
which
caldigate
did
before
he
took
his
wife
abroad
was
to
after
dick
shand
it
was
manifest
to
all
concerned
that
dick
could
do
no
good
in
england
his
yellow
trousers
and
the
manners
which
accompanied
them
were
not
generally
acceptable
in
merchants
offices
and
suchlike
places
he
knew
nothing
about
english
farming
which
for
those
who
have
not
learned
the
work
early
is
an
expensive
amusement
rather
than
a
trade
by
which
bread
can
be
earned
there
seemed
to
be
hardly
a
hope
for
dick
in
england
but
he
had
done
some
good
among
the
south
sea
islanders
he
knew
their
ways
and
could
manage
them
he
was
sent
out
therefore
with
a
small
capital
to
be
junior
partner
on
a
sugar
estate
in
queensland
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
small
capital
was
lent
to
him
by
john
caldigate
there
he
took
steadily
to
work
and
it
is
hoped
by
his
friends
that
he
will
soon
begin
to
repay
the
loan
the
uncle
aunt
and
cousins
at
babington
soon
renewed
their
intimacy
with
john
caldigate
and
became
intimate
with
hester
the
old
squire
still
turned
up
his
nose
at
them
as
he
had
done
all
his
life
calling
them
boeotians
and
reminding
his
son
that
suffolk
had
always
been
a
silly
county
but
the
babingtons
one
and
all
knew
this
and
had
no
objection
to
be
accounted
as
long
as
they
were
acknowledged
to
be
prosperous
happy
and
comfortable
it
had
always
been
considered
at
babington
that
young
caldigate
was
brighter
and
more
clever
than
themselves
and
yet
he
had
been
popular
with
them
as
a
cousin
of
whom
they
ought
to
be
proud
he
was
soon
restored
to
his
former
favour
and
after
his
return
from
the
continent
spent
a
fortnight
at
the
hall
with
his
wife
very
comfortably
julia
indeed
was
not
there
nor
smirkie
among
all
their
neighbours
and
acquaintances
smirkie
was
the
last
to
drop
the
idea
that
there
must
have
been
something
in
that
story
of
an
australian
marriage
his
theory
of
the
law
on
the
subject
was
still
incorrect
the
queen
pardon
he
said
could
not
do
away
with
the
verdict
and
therefore
he
doubted
whether
the
couple
could
be
regarded
as
man
and
wife
he
was
very
anxious
that
they
should
be
married
again
and
with
great
offered
to
perform
the
ceremony
himself
either
at
or
even
in
the
at
folking
to
the
very
backbone
was
the
remark
of
the
cambridgeshire
squire
when
he
heard
of
this
very
kind
offer
but
even
he
at
last
came
round
under
his
wife
persuasion
when
he
found
that
the
paternal
mansion
was
likely
to
be
shut
against
him
unless
he
yielded
hester
second
tour
with
her
husband
was
postponed
for
some
weeks
because
it
was
necessary
that
her
husband
should
appear
as
a
witness
against
crinkett
and
euphemia
smith
they
were
tried
also
at
cambridge
but
not
before
judge
bramber
the
woman
never
yielded
an
inch
when
she
found
how
it
was
going
with
her
she
made
fast
her
money
and
with
infinite
pluck
resolved
that
she
would
endure
with
patience
whatever
might
be
in
store
for
her
and
wait
for
better
times
when
put
into
the
dock
she
pleaded
not
guilty
with
a
voice
that
was
audible
only
to
the
jailer
standing
beside
her
and
after
that
did
not
open
her
mouth
during
the
trial
crinkett
made
a
great
effort
to
be
admitted
as
an
additional
witness
against
his
comrade
but
having
failed
in
that
pleaded
guilty
at
last
he
felt
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
with
such
a
weight
of
evidence
against
him
and
calculated
that
his
punishment
might
thus
be
lighter
and
that
he
would
save
himself
the
cost
of
an
expensive
defence
in
the
former
hope
he
was
deceived
as
the
two
were
condemned
to
the
same
term
of
imprisonment
when
the
woman
heard
that
she
was
to
be
confined
for
three
years
with
hard
labour
her
spirit
was
almost
broken
but
she
made
no
outward
sign
and
as
she
was
led
away
out
of
the
dock
she
looked
round
for
caldigate
to
wither
him
with
the
last
glance
of
her
reproach
but
caldigate
who
had
not
beheld
her
misery
without
some
pang
at
his
heart
had
already
left
the
court
judge
bramber
never
opened
his
mouth
upon
the
matter
to
a
single
human
being
he
was
a
man
who
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
did
not
say
much
about
the
daily
work
of
his
life
and
who
had
but
few
friends
sufficiently
intimate
to
be
trusted
with
his
judicial
feelings
the
secretary
of
state
was
enabled
to
triumph
in
the
correctness
of
his
decision
but
it
may
be
a
question
whether
judge
bramber
enjoyed
the
triumph
the
matter
had
gone
luckily
for
the
secretary
but
how
would
it
have
been
had
crinkett
and
the
woman
been
acquitted
how
would
it
have
been
had
caldigate
broken
down
in
his
evidence
and
been
forced
to
admit
that
there
had
been
a
marriage
of
some
kind
no
doubt
the
accusation
had
been
false
no
doubt
the
verdict
had
been
erroneous
but
the
man
had
brought
it
upon
himself
by
his
own
egregious
folly
and
would
have
had
no
just
cause
for
complaint
had
he
been
kept
in
prison
till
the
second
case
had
been
tried
it
was
thus
that
judge
bramber
regarded
the
matter
but
he
said
not
a
word
about
it
to
any
one
when
the
second
trial
was
over
caldigate
and
his
wife
started
for
paris
but
stayed
a
few
days
on
their
way
with
william
bolton
in
london
he
and
his
wife
were
quite
ready
to
receive
hester
and
her
husband
with
open
arms
tell
you
fairly
said
he
to
caldigate
when
there
was
a
doubt
i
thought
it
better
that
you
and
hester
should
be
apart
you
would
have
thought
the
same
had
she
been
your
sister
now
i
am
only
too
happy
to
congratulate
both
of
you
that
the
truth
has
been
brought
to
light
on
their
return
robert
bolton
was
very
friendly
and
robert
bolton
himself
was
at
last
brought
round
to
acknowledge
that
his
convictions
had
been
wrong
but
there
was
still
much
that
stuck
in
his
throat
did
john
caldigate
pay
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
those
persons
when
he
knew
that
they
had
hatched
a
conspiracy
against
himself
this
question
he
asked
his
brother
william
over
and
over
again
and
never
could
be
satisfied
with
any
answer
which
his
brother
could
give
him
once
he
asked
the
question
of
caldigate
himself
i
felt
that
in
honour
i
owed
it
to
them
said
caldigate
perhaps
a
little
too
because
i
felt
that
if
they
took
themselves
off
at
once
your
sister
might
be
spared
something
of
the
pain
which
she
has
suffered
but
still
it
was
unintelligible
to
robert
bolton
that
any
man
in
his
senses
should
give
away
so
large
a
sum
of
money
with
so
slight
a
prospect
of
any
substantial
return
hester
often
goes
to
see
her
mother
but
bolton
has
never
been
at
folking
and
probably
never
will
again
visit
that
house
she
is
a
woman
whose
heart
is
not
capable
of
many
changes
and
who
can
not
readily
give
herself
to
new
affections
but
having
once
owned
that
john
caldigate
is
her
daughter
husband
she
now
alleges
no
further
doubt
on
the
matter
she
writes
the
words
john
caldigate
without
a
struggle
and
does
take
delight
in
her
daughter
visits
when
last
i
heard
from
folking
john
caldigate
second
boy
had
just
been
born
