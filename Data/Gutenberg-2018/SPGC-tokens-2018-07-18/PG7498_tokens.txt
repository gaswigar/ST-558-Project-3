walked
off

alone
in

miss
pepper
polly
turned
quickly
it
was
such
an
anxious
little
cry
what
oh
amy
loughead
amy
threw
herself
up
against
polly
gown
oh
if
i
may
she
began
flushing
painfully
you
see
my
brother
is
coming
i
a
letter
so
if
you
will
let
me
let
you
what
cried
polly
with
a
little
laugh
go
on
amy
do
be
afraid
you
see
it
is
just
this
way
amy
twisted
her
fingers
together
drew
her
breath
hard
and
rushed
on
nervously
jack
he
my
brother
you
know
promised
me
i
never
told
you
if
i
would
only
learn
to
play
on
the
piano
he
take
me
to
europe
with
him
next
time
and
now
coming
and
and
oh
what
shall
i
do
amy
was
far
gone
now
and
she
ended
with
a
little
howl
of
distress
that
brought
two
or
three
of
the
salisbury
girls
flying
in
with
astonishment
go
back
said
polly
to
them
all
and
they
ran
off
as
suddenly
as
they
had
popped
in
to
leave
amy
and
the
music
teacher
alone
now
amy
said
polly
kindly
getting
down
on
her
knees
beside
the
girl
where
she
had
thrown
herself
on
the
broad
lounge
you
must
just
understand
dear
that
i
can
not
help
you
unless
you
will
have
and
be
a
little
woman
yourself
you
told
me
i
would
be
sorry
if
i
did
practice
mourned
amy
dragging
her
wet
little
handkerchief
between
her
fingers
but
i
suppose
jack
was
coming
for
six
months
and
i
have
time
to
catch
up
and
now
oh
dear
me
and
she
burrowed
deeper
into
miss
salisbury
big
take
care
warned
polly
with
a
ready
hand
to
rescue
the
elaborate
combination
of
silk
and
floss
it
would
be
a
very
dreadful
thing
if
this
should
get
spoiled
amy
loughead
brought
her
wet
cheek
off
suddenly
there
is
a
single
tear
on
it
miss
pepper
she
gasped
that
very
fortunate
said
polly
with
a
relieved
breath
well
amy
child
how
can
i
help
you
she
sat
down
now
and
drew
the
girl
hot
little
hand
within
her
own
i
can
almost
play
that
horrible
said
amy
irrelevantly
that
is
i
could
if
oh
miss
pepper
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
brought
her
flushed
face
very
near
to
the
one
above
her
could
you
help
me
play
it
just
hear
me
you
know
and
tell
me
things
you
did
over
again
about
it
if
i
practice
all
the
afternoon
could
you
this
evening
do
you
mean
asked
polly
a
trifle
sharply
yes
said
amy
faintly
and
twisting
her
handkerchief
oh
dear
me
i
know
you
so
tired
what
shall
i
do
but
you
do
understand
cried
polly
vexed
with
herself
that
she
could
help
her
annoyance
from
being
seen
i
shall
put
some
one
else
out
if
i
give
up
my
evening
i
have
an
engagement
amy
no
i
do
see
how
i
can
do
it
child
i
sorry
and
then
before
she
knew
how
she
put
both
arms
around
the
little
figure
do
cry
dear
i
suppose
i
must
i
get
out
of
the
other
thing
yes
fly
at
chopin
and
keep
your
courage
up
and
i
be
over
at
seven
then
brother
jack
will
say
fine
and
off
you
go
over
the
seas
outside
polly
after
enlisting
miss
salisbury
favor
for
the
plan
was
hurrying
along
the
pavement
calling
herself
an
hundred
foolish
names
for
helping
an
idle
girl
out
of
a
scrape
and
to
think
of
losing
the
only
chance
to
hear
she
mourned
well
it
done
now
and
ca
be
helped
even
jasper
when
he
hears
of
it
will
think
me
a
silly
i
suppose
now
to
make
my
peace
with
pickering
she
turned
down
the
avenue
running
out
from
the
street
that
had
the
honor
to
contain
miss
salisbury
boarding
and
day
school
for
young
ladies
and
met
face
to
face
suddenly
a
young
man
about
whose
joy
at
meeting
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
oh
polly
he
cried
here
let
me
take
that
detestable
thing
trying
to
get
the
out
of
her
hand
take
care
how
you
talk
against
this
cried
polly
hugging
it
closer
indeed
you
shall
not
touch
it
till
you
are
glad
that
i
am
a
music
teacher
oh
i
must
tell
you
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
house
because
i
was
afraid
you
would
understand
a
note
i
ca
go
ca
go
repeated
pickering
in
his
astonishment
forgetting
all
his
manners
why
polly
pepper
what
do
you
mean
why
i
must
give
it
up
cried
polly
nervously
do
ask
me
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
pickering
then
you
see
i
ca
help
myself
and
polly
rapidly
unfolded
her
plan
for
the
evening
omitting
all
details
as
to
amy
careless
waste
of
her
lessons
despite
all
efforts
to
make
her
practice
at
the
end
of
the
recital
pickering
dodge
came
to
a
full
pause
on
the
sidewalk
regardless
of
all
and
turned
a
glowering
face
on
polly
who
was
forced
to
stand
still
also
and
look
at
him
what
idiocy
he
exclaimed
to
give
up
for
that
ignoramus
polly
are
you
losing
your
senses
i
do
know
said
poor
polly
who
had
lost
the
first
flush
of
enthusiasm
over
her
plan
and
to
whom
nothing
now
seemed
so
delightful
as
the
sight
and
sound
of
and
his
wonderful
melody
well
done
so
do
tempt
me
to
feel
badly
pickering
indeed
and
it
not
done
said
pickering
angrily
you
made
the
engagement
polly
i
never
knew
you
to
break
one
before
he
added
stingingly
the
tears
flew
into
polly
brown
eyes
and
every
bit
of
color
deserted
her
round
cheek
do
call
it
that
pickering
she
implored
putting
out
her
hand
i
shall
call
it
just
what
it
is
declared
pickering
in
his
stiffest
fashion
it
a
broken
engagement
polly
pepper
nothing
more
nor
less
then
said
polly
all
her
tears
dried
i
must
go
with
you
if
you
hold
me
to
it
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
i
will
be
ready
and
she
moved
off
with
her
most
superb
air
without
deigning
a
illustration
why
polly
pepper
what
do
you
mean
oh
polly
cried
pickering
starting
forward
to
overtake
her
see
here
if
you
very
much
wish
it
why
of
course
polly
polly
do
look
around
what
do
you
wish
to
say
asked
polly
not
looking
around
as
he
gained
her
side
why
of
course
cried
pickering
his
words
stumbling
over
each
other
if
you
ca
go
i
i
give
it
up
and
stay
at
home
and
why
should
you
stay
at
home
cried
polly
suddenly
giving
him
a
glimpse
of
her
face
you
lovely
seats
do
ask
alexia
alexia
exclaimed
pickering
angrily
indeed
i
will
not
i
do
want
any
one
if
i
ca
have
you
polly
he
was
really
miserable
now
and
needed
comfort
so
she
turned
around
and
administered
it
as
only
polly
could
by
the
time
the
talk
was
over
she
hurried
off
with
a
radiant
face
and
pickering
with
an
expression
only
one
remove
from
that
of
absolute
gloom
retraced
his
steps
to
lay
one
of
the
lovely
seats
for
the
concert
before
miss
rhys
for
her
acceptance
phronsie
came
slowly
down
the
hall
to
meet
polly
as
usual
this
day
with
one
of
her
company
white
gowns
on
polly
always
knew
when
these
were
donned
that
something
unusual
was
to
be
expected
from
the
daily
routine
of
the
household
are
you
really
and
truly
home
polly
asked
phronsie
taking
the
to
tuck
it
under
her
own
arm
yes
pet
polly
set
a
kiss
on
the
red
lips
and
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
beaver
phronsie
so
you
must
be
said
phronsie
with
a
little
sigh
for
you
were
so
long
in
coming
home
well
do
hurry
now
polly
this
last
as
polly
was
skipping
over
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
to
freshen
up
a
bit
then
phronsie
turned
into
the
to
be
quite
sure
that
the
butler
had
made
the
belated
luncheon
as
fine
as
polly
could
desire
it
she
did
ask
why
i
had
on
this
gown
mused
phronsie
softly
disposing
again
the
flowers
at
polly
plate
and
it
funny
i
think
for
polly
always
sees
everything
and
she
began
to
look
troubled
at
once
illustration
phronsie
came
slowly
down
the
hall
this
is
just
as
splendid
as
it
can
be
cried
polly
coming
in
and
picking
up
one
of
the
roses
at
her
plate
phronsie
you
are
just
a
dear
to
have
everything
so
nice
and
she
fastened
it
at
her
belt
why
dear
me
you
a
fine
gown
on
what
is
going
to
happen
and
you
did
see
it
said
phronsie
a
bit
reproachfully
as
she
gently
smoothed
the
front
breadth
of
mull
forgive
me
dear
begged
polly
well
what
is
it
pet
do
tell
me
for
i
dying
of
curiosity
as
the
salisbury
girls
say
phronsie
stood
up
on
tiptoe
and
achieved
polly
ear
who
do
you
think
is
coming
she
whispered
impressively
oh
dear
me
i
ca
possibly
guess
said
polly
beginning
to
think
that
this
one
evening
of
all
the
year
held
supreme
moments
for
her
who
is
it
phronsie
do
tell
me
quickly
well
said
phronsie
drawing
off
to
see
the
surprised
delight
sure
to
come
on
polly
face
it
jasper
himself
not
jasper
exclaimed
polly
quite
gone
with
joy
oh
phronsie
pepper
you
ca
mean
that
but
i
do
said
phronsie
forgetting
her
age
to
hop
up
and
down
on
the
rug
we
a
letter
while
you
were
at
the
school
and
i
was
to
tell
you
suddenly
so
i
put
on
one
of
my
nice
gowns
so
you
would
know
but
how
could
i
possibly
suppose
that
jasper
would
come
now
cried
polly
seizing
phronsie
hands
to
execute
one
of
the
dances
now
i
almost
know
he
is
going
to
stay
over
christmas

cried
phronsie
in
a
little
scream
you
guessed
it
polly
and
mamsie
said
she
gone
down
town
with
grandpapa
he
going
to
get
tickets
for
the
concert
so
that
you
can
all
go
together
even
if
you
ca
sit
together
and
she
said
that
oh
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
and
she
stood
quite
still
are
you
glad
asked
phronsie
her
joy
suddenly
hushed
and
i
done
it
myself
spoiled
all
this
loveliness
cried
polly
passionately
little
white
lines
coming
around
her
mouth
and
jasper
here
oh
polly
polly
phronsie
clasped
her
gown
imploringly
do
polly

just
wo

the
school

polly
at
white
heat

care
for
the
concert
but
i
send
a
note
over
to
say
that
i
am
detained
at
home

begged
phronsie
all
sorts
of
dreadful
surmises
seizing
her
do

me
polly
wo

it
nothing
you
would
understand
child
said
polly
quickly
there
do
ask
phronsie
crept
away
in
a
grieved
fashion
to
be
presently
folded
into
polly
warm
arms
i
bad
phronsie
dear
there
pet
now
you
are
all
right

you
as
she
hugged
her
close
i

phronsie
doubtfully
well
i
all
right

said
polly
her
brow
clearing
the
bad

gone
at
last
i
hope
to
stay
away
phronsie
now
i
must
hurry
and
eat
this
nice
luncheon
you
fixed
for
me
and
she
sprang
toward
the
table
do
you
want
to
write
a
note
first
asked
phronsie
wondering
at
polly
strange
mood
and
following
her
to
the
you
said
so
no
i
given
it
up
said
polly
sitting
down
and
beginning
on
her
chop
and
toast
bless

dear
you

me
an
orchid
glancing
down
between
her
mouthfuls
to
the
bouquet
at
her
plate

have
saved
them
all
for
jasper
turner
said
i
might
have

said
phronsie
triumphantly
and
i
knew
you
give
it
to
jasper
so
it
all
right

do
double
duty
said
polly
merrily
with
a
tender
glance
for
the
orchid
well
how
baby
he
is
very
nice
said
phronsie
with
a
air
and
did
cry
a
bit
for
mamsie
and
now
if
you
are
really
all
right
polly
i
go
up
to
the
nursery
and
look
at

so
i
would
said
polly
approvingly
yes

all
right

i
on
my
chop
no
phronsie
smiled
with
great
satisfaction
at
this
and
went
off
at
a
quarter
of
seven
polly
in
a
storm
of
remonstrance
from
all
but
one
hurried
off
to
help
poor
amy
loughead
through
her
slough
of
despond
jasper
alone
just
arrived
for
dinner
was
the
only
one
who
remained
silent
when
the
storm
of
disapproval
broke
forth
over
polly
and
her
doings
after
the
first
astonished
exclamation
he
had
absolutely
refused
to
say
anything
save
polly
knows
best
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
said
polly
out
in
the
wide
hall
where
he
hurried
to
meet
her
as
she
ran
downstairs
with
her
plainest
walking
things
on
for
i
do
believe
they
would
have
let
me
go
i
never
saw
mamsie
feel
so
jasper
and
now
polly
could
not
keep
the
tears
back
she
see
it
all
right
said
jasper
soothingly
he
put
his
hand
out
and
grasped
hers
as
in
the
old
days
in
the
little
brown
house
and
polly
answered
through
her
tears
i
know
jasper
and
then
the
maid
appearing
who
was
to
accompany
her
to
miss
salisbury
polly
came
out
from
her
tears
and
said
i
ready
barbara
you
are
not
needed
barbara
said
jasper
reaching
up
for
his
from
the
oaken
rack
what
are
you
going
to
do
gasped
polly
her
hand
on
the
and
glancing
back
walk
over
with
you
to
that
center
of
culture
and
wisdom
said
jasper
coolly
close
beside
her
now
his
hat
in
his
hand
o
jasper
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
her
face
growing
quite
pale
do
you
be
late
for
the
concert
barbara
barbara
polly
looked
past
him
to
summon
the
departing
maid
barbara
is
a
good
girl
and
understands
the
duty
of
obedience
said
jasper
laughingly
there
no
help
for
it
polly
you
must
accept
my
escort
and
he
opened
the
door
but
grandpapa
he
will
be
terribly
disappointed
not
to
have
you
go
to
the
concert
with
him
cried
polly
getting
down
the
steps
with
a
dreadful
weight
at
her
heart
i
made
it
all
right
with
father
said
jasper
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
your
plan
and
alstyne
is
on
his
way
over
to
take
my
place
at
least
he
ought
to
be
in
response
to
my
note
do
worry
polly
come
oh
what
perfectly
elegant
seats
exclaimed
alexia
rhys
waving
her
big
ostrich
fan
contentedly
and
sweeping
the
audience
with
a
long
gaze
everybody
is
here
pickering
that
not
so
said
pickering
savagely
and
bestowing
a
thump
on
his
unoffending
opera
hat
already
reduced
to
the
smallest
possible
bulk
do
spoil
it
advised
alexia
coolly
with
a
sidelong
gaze
at
his
face
well
of
course
i
mean
everybody
except
polly
and
i
sure
pickering
it
is
my
fault
that
she
did
come
polly
always
was
queer
about
some
things
pickering
did
not
answer
but
bestowed
his
glance
on
the
programme
in
his
hand
and
now
she
is
queerer
than
ever
said
alexia
glad
to
think
that
the
dainty
blue
affair
on
her
head
she
called
a
bonnet
was
already
doing
its
work
as
she
heard
a
lady
in
the
seat
back
of
them
question
if
it
were
not
one
of
the
newest
of
madame
marchaud
creations
so
she
sat
more
erect
and
played
nonchalantly
with
her
fan
yes
and
it
all
because
of
those
dreadfully
horrid
music
lessons
pickering
coughed
and
rattled
his
programme
ominously
which
alexia
pretended
not
to
hear
why
king
lets
her
do
it
i
ca
see
she
went
on
do
stop
said
pickering
shortly
and
casting
a
nervous
glance
back
of
her
shoulder
never
mind
if
they
do
hear
said
alexia
sweetly
all
the
better
then
they
know
we
do
approve
of
her
doing
so
at
any
rate
i
do
approve
said
pickering
his
face
flaming
if
she
wants
to
and
we
got
to
any
way
because
we
ca
help
ourselves
i
do
wish
alexia
you
would
discuss
our
friends
in
this
public
way
and
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
sweet
thing
to
invite
a
girl
to
a
concert
and
then
get
up
a
fight
said
alexia
back
at
him
goodness
who
fighting
exclaimed
pickering
under
his
breath
you
are
i
wish
you
could
see
your
face
it
as
black
as
a
thunder
cloud
said
alexia
with
the
consciousness
that
her
own
was
as
calm
as
a
june
morning
and
i
sure
if
you
do
want
to
attract
people
to
our
conversation
you
might
at
least
look
a
little
pleasanter
pickering
threw
two
or
three
nervous
glances
on
either
side
to
prove
her
words
and
was
by
no
means
reassured
to
see
the
countenance
of
billy
harlow
one
of
his
young
business
friends
across
the
aisle
suffused
with
an
attempt
to
appear
as
if
he
had
been
a
witness
to
the
little
well
i
morally
certain
i
wo
trouble
you
with
another
invitation
to
a
concert
he
said
too
furious
to
quite
know
his
own
words
you
need
said
alexia
swinging
her
fan
with
an
even
hand
and
still
smiling
sweetly
this
time
including
in
it
billy
who
had
no
girl
with
him
i
really
could
endure
life
at
home
better
than
this
bliss
and
then
came
on
the
stage
and
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
keep
quiet
so
the
hostilities
died
down
going
out
of
the
opera
house
billy
harlow
ran
up
to
the
two
lovely
time
you
had
he
said
on
alexia
side
and
with
a
little
grimace
have
i
said
alexia
back
again
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
pickering
stalking
along
by
her
side
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
did
care
what
was
being
said
about
him
just
look
at
him
now
said
alexia
softly
is
he
sweet
and
fancy
my
bearing
it
for
two
hours
i
do
think
any
other
girl
in
our
set
could
why
did
miss
pepper
come
this
evening
asked
harlow
curiously
pickering
said
he
asked
her
oh
she
gave
it
up
to
help
some
girl
said
alexia
carelessly
the
music
teacher
at
miss
salisbury
school
you
know
oh
is
she
asked
harlow
innocently
forgetting
to
mention
the
daily
interviews
he
sustained
with
his
sisters
kitty
and
grace
who
were
salisbury
girls
on
miss
pepper
movements
and
at
the
last
minute
he
asked
me
to
take
her
place
said
alexia
with
perfect
frankness
and
i
was
goose
enough
to
do
it
is
miss
pepper
going
to
give
a
recital
pretty
soon
asked
harlow
incidentally
as
they
worked
their
way
along
to
the
entrance
yes
she
is
said
alexia
sharply
at
the
exeter
we
ca
stop
her
she
says
she
proud
to
do
it
and
it
shows
the
girls
wonderful
ability
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
and
oh
dear
me
after
once
done
that
she
always
be
pepper
the
music
teacher
it
horrid
i
believe
that
is
our
carriage
said
pickering
stiffly
and
without
so
much
as
a
at
billy
come
alexia
chapter
ii
getting
ready
for
christmas
baby
ought
to
have
a
christmas
tree
said
phronsie
slowly
ah
how
is
that
do
you
want
a
christmas
tree
jasper
dropped
to
by
the
side
of
the
white
bundle
in
the
center
of
the
library
rug
as
he
propounded
the
momentous
question
the
baby
plunged
forward
and
buried
both
fat
hands
in
the
crop
of
brown
hair
so
suddenly
brought
to
his
notice
is
that
the
way
to
show
your
acknowledgment
sir
cried
jasper
springing
to
his
feet
baby
and
all
well
there
you
go
there
and
there
and
there
tossing
the
white
bundle
high
in
the
air
goodness
what
a
breeze
you
two
contrive
to
raise
exclaimed
joel
mamsie
as
mother
fisher
put
her
head
in
the
doorway
the
little
chap
is
getting
the
worst
of
it
i
tell
you
joel
jealous
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
take
care
that
really
is
my
hair
sir
fisher
nodded
and
chuckled
to
the
baby
and
hurried
off
he
did
really
mean
to
pull
your
hair
jasper
said
phronsie
in
a
worried
way
and
getting
up
from
the
floor
where
she
had
been
deserted
by
the
baby
she
hurried
over
to
the
two
flying
around
in
the
center
of
the
room
but
he
does
pull
dreadfully
though
said
polly
laughing
do
you
you
little
king
pinching
baby
toes
as
jasper
spun
him
past
her
my
goodness
exclaimed
king
coming
in
the
opposite
doorway
i
should
think
it
was
a
menagerie
here
what
the
matter
phronsie
baby
is
pulling
jasper
hair
said
phronsie
slowly
and
revolving
around
the
two
dancers
but
he
really
does
mean
to
grandpapa
oh
i
hope
he
does
said
old
king
cheerfully
coming
in
and
sitting
down
in
his
favorite
chair
i
sure
it
speaks
well
for
the
young
man
powers
of
if
he
gives
jasper
a
good
tweak
father
cried
jasper
in
pretended
astonishment
well
as
popular
opinion
is
against
me
i
set
you
down
again
and
nurse
my
poor
scalp
and
down
went
the
white
bundle
again
to
the
floor
phronsie
going
back
to
her
post
as
nurse
there
been
a
terrible
scheme
worked
up
since
you
were
out
sir
announced
joel
to
the
old
gentleman
hey
what
that
demanded
king
staring
at
polly
oh
it
is
polly
this
time
said
joel
with
a
laugh
generally
it
is
polly
that
sets
all
dreadful
things
going
but
this
time
it
is
some
other
ringleader
then
i
am
sure
i
approve
if
polly
is
in
it
declared
the
old
gentleman
flatly
but
i
am
in
it
grandpapa
polly
made
haste
to
say
i
think
it
is
very
very
nice
that
alters
the
case
said
king
so
what
is
it
joe
out
with
it
it
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
upset
this
house
from
top
to
bottom
said
joel
and
get
up
a
dreadful
howling
tearing
christmas
tree
illustration
baby
ought
to
have
a
christmas
tree
said
phronsie
slowly
oh
joe
pepper
ejaculated
polly
reproachfully
and
you
always
had
such
fun
over
our
christmas
trees
how
can
you
it
for
baby
cried
phronsie
with
a
pink
flush
on
her
cheek
never
seen
one
you
know
grandpapa
no
i
should
think
not
said
the
old
gentleman
looking
down
at
the
white
bundle
well
and
so
you
want
a
christmas
tree
for
him
phronsie
child
i
think
we
ought
to
have
one
said
phronsie
because
you
know
never
never
seen
one
and
we
all
have
had
so
many
beautiful
trees
grandpapa
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
said
king
well
now
phronsie
child
come
here
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
he
held
out
his
hand
phronsie
cast
an
anxious
glance
at
the
bundle
can
i
leave
him
grandpapa
she
asked
leave
him
mercy
yes
it
does
babies
good
to
be
left
alone
he
suck
his
thumbs
or
his
toes
i
stay
with
him
said
polly
running
out
of
her
corner
to
get
on
her
knees
before
the
baby
there
now
sir
do
you
know
what
a
blessed
old
care
you
are
smothering
him
with
kisses
yes
i
really
think
we
ought
to
have
a
christmas
tree
phronsie
was
saying
grandpapa
dear
huddling
up
against
his
waistcoat
as
usual
then
we
surely
will
have
one
declared
old
king
so
that
is
settled
do
you
hear
young
people
raising
his
voice
or
does
that
little
scamp
of
a
baby
take
all
your
ears
we
hear
grandpapa
said
polly
from
the
floor
and
i
very
glad
it
will
be
good
fun
to
get
up
a
christmas
tree
seeing
you
never
have
had
that
pleasing
employment
said
jasper
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
never
mind
it
be
just
as
good
fun
again
said
polly
and
not
a
bit
of
work
oh
no
do
throw
cold
water
on
it
begged
polly
under
her
breath
while
the
baby
scrambled
all
over
her
do
jasper
phronsie
has
set
her
heart
on
it
all
right
but
i
thought
you
wanted
every
bit
of
time
to
get
ready
for
your
recital
and
the
other
things
and
then
besides
phronsie
performance
down
at
dunraven
well
so
i
did
confessed
polly
with
a
sigh
but
i
can
get
the
time
some
way
out
of
other
things
said
jasper
grimly
polly
you
have
no
fun
from
the
holidays
it
is
too
late
to
stop
this
now
he
darted
over
toward
his
father
jasper
cried
polly
imploringly
what
is
it
my
boy
asked
king
quite
deep
in
the
plans
for
the
tree
joel
having
added
himself
to
their
company
oh
nothing
polly
wants
it
and
we
must
make
it
a
good
one
said
jasper
rather
incoherently
and
beginning
to
retreat
of
course
it
will
be
a
good
one
said
his
father
a
trifle
testily
if
we
have
it
at
all
when
did
we
ever
get
up
a
poor
tree
pray
tell
polly
drew
a
relieved
breath
and
gathering
the
baby
up
in
her
arms
she
hurried
over
to
the
old
gentleman
chair
with
a
now
when
do
you
want
to
have
the
tree
phronsie
must
we
have
it
christmas
day
asked
phronsie
looking
at
her
anxiously
christmas
day
dear
me
no
why
what
would
the
dunraven
children
do
phronsie
if
you
took
that
day
away
from
them
cried
old
king
in
astonishment
phronsie
turned
slowly
back
to
him
i
thought
perhaps
we
ought
to
let
baby
have
the
tree
christmas
day
she
said
no
indeed
again
said
king
come
here
you
little
scamp
catching
the
baby
out
of
polly
hand
to
set
him
on
his
other
knee
there
now
speak
up
like
a
man
and
tell
your
sister
that
you
are
not
particular
about
the
time
you
have
your
tree
ar
goo
said
the
fisher
baby
that
it
said
the
old
gentleman
with
approval
while
the
others
shouted
so
now
as
long
as
your
brother
says
so
phronsie
why
i
should
have
your
tree
the
day
before
christmas
oh
polly
wants
to
go
began
jasper
ugh
cried
polly
warningly
to
him
yes
phronsie
you
much
better
have
it
the
day
before
as
grandpapa
says
and
you
do
suppose
baby
will
feel
badly
afterwards
when
he
gets
bigger
and
cry
because
we
did
give
him
christmas
day
said
phronsie
do
you
grandpapa
indeed
i
do
declared
the
old
gentleman
pinching
the
set
of
pink
toes
nearest
to
his
hand
if
he
does
why
we
all
let
him
know
what
we
think
of
such
conduct
then
said
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
i
should
very
much
rather
not
take
christmas
day
from
the
dunraven
children
because
you
know
grandpapa
they
expect
it
of
course
they
do
said
old
king
bless
me
why
we
know
it
was
christmas
at
all
if
we
did
go
down
to
bedford
and
carry
it
and
as
for
those
children
the
picture
that
this
brought
up
of
dunraven
without
a
christmas
threw
such
a
shadow
over
phronsie
face
that
polly
hastened
to
say
reassuringly
oh
grandpapa
we
would
ever
think
of
not
carrying
a
christmas
to
dunraven
would
we
pet
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
phronsie
of
course
not
chimed
in
jasper
and
joel
in
a
way
to
bring
back
the
smiles
to
the
little
downcast
face
and
the
baby
crowed
and
seized
phronsie
floating
yellow
hair
with
both
hands
and
they
all
got
in
one
another
way
to
rescue
it
and
pepper
hurried
in
again
this
time
for
baby
and
he
was
kissed
all
around
phronsie
giving
him
two
for
fear
he
might
think
she
was
hurt
and
one
of
the
maids
popped
in
with
there
is
a
gentleman
in
the
reception
room
to
see
miss
mary
jasper
turned
off
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
do
suppose
it
is
loughead
said
polly
for
he
wanted
to
come
some
time
and
talk
about
amy
o
dear
i
hope
i
shall
say
the
right
thing
does
the
fellow
know
better
than
to
come
when
we
are
home
for
the
christmas
holidays
grumbled
joel
jasper
looked
as
if
he
could
say
as
much
but
instead
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
silently
he
very
anxious
about
amy
said
polly
running
off
to
the
door
where
she
paused
and
looked
back
for
sympathy
toward
her
little
protege
i
should
think
he
would
be
grunted
joel
she
a
goose
and
beside
that
she
does
know
anything
o
joe
she
has
any
father
nor
mother
cried
polly
in
distress
joel
gave
an
inaudible
reply
and
polly
ran
off
carrying
a
face
on
which
the
sunshine
struggled
to
get
back
to
its
accustomed
place
beg
pardon
for
troubling
you
said
a
tall
young
man
getting
off
from
the
divan
to
meet
her
as
she
hurried
into
the
reception
room
but
you
were
good
enough
to
say
that
i
might
talk
with
you
about
my
sister
and
really
i
am
very
much
at
sea
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
miss
pepper
it
was
a
long
speech
and
at
the
end
of
it
polly
and
the
caller
were
seated
she
in
a
big
chair
and
he
back
on
the
divan
opposite
to
her
i
am
glad
to
see
you
loughead
said
polly
brightly
and
i
hope
i
can
help
you
for
i
am
very
fond
of
amy
it
good
of
you
to
say
so
said
jack
loughead
for
she
a
trying
little
minx
enough
i
suspect
and
miss
salisbury
tells
me
you
had
no
end
of
trouble
with
her
miss
salisbury
should
say
that
cried
polly
involuntarily
then
she
stopped
with
a
blush
i
mean
i
do
think
she
quite
understands
it
amy
does
really
try
hard
to
study
oh
said
jack
loughead
then
he
tapped
his
boot
with
his
so
you
really
think
my
sister
will
amount
to
something
miss
pepper
he
looked
at
her
keenly
polly
started
oh
yes
indeed
why
she
must
mr
loughead
he
laughed
and
bit
his
moustache
and
really
i
do
think
that
amy
is
quite
understood
said
polly
warmly
and
forgetting
herself
if
people
believe
in
her
it
makes
her
want
to
do
things
to
please
them
she
says
herself
she
has
bothered
you
dreadfully
said
jack
with
a
vicious
thrust
of
the
at
his
boot
she
has
a
little
confessed
polly
but
not
dreadfully
and
i
do
think
loughead
now
that
you
have
come
and
that
she
sees
how
much
you
want
her
to
study
and
practice
she
will
really
do
better
i
do
indeed
said
polly
earnestly
outside
she
could
hear
the
two
boys
as
she
still
called
them
and
grandpapa
voice
in
animated
consultation
over
the
ways
and
means
she
knew
as
well
as
if
she
were
there
of
spending
the
holidays
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
never
sit
in
the
reception
room
another
moment
longer
but
that
she
must
fly
out
to
them
illustration
oh
said
jack
loughead
then
he
tapped
his
boot
with
his
walking
stick
amy
has
no
mother
said
jack
loughead
after
a
moment
and
he
turned
away
his
head
and
pretended
to
look
out
of
the
window
i
know
it
polly
heart
leaped
guiltily
oh
how
could
she
think
of
holidays
and
good
times
while
this
poor
little
girl
but
fifteen
had
only
a
dreary
sense
of
life
to
mean
home
to
her
and
oh
i
do
think
polly
hastened
to
say
and
she
clasped
her
hands
as
phronsie
would
have
done
it
has
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
her
and
she
does
just
lovely
so
much
better
i
mean
than
other
girls
would
in
her
place
i
do
really
loughead
repeated
polly
and
no
sister
added
jack
as
if
to
himself
how
is
a
fellow
like
me
why
i
am
miss
pepper
and
i
been
knocking
about
the
world
ever
since
i
was
her
age
my
uncle
took
me
then
to
australia
into
his
business
how
am
i
ever
to
as
you
call
it
that
girl
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
his
distress
and
polly
with
a
deaf
ear
to
the
chatter
out
in
the
library
now
bent
all
her
energies
to
helping
him
loughead
she
said
and
the
color
deserted
her
round
cheek
and
she
leaned
forward
from
the
depths
of
the
big
chair
i
am
afraid
you
wo
like
what
i
am
going
to
say
go
on
please
said
jack
his
eyes
on
her
face
i
think
if
you
want
to
understand
amy
said
polly
holding
her
hands
very
tightly
together
to
keep
her
courage
up
you
must
love
her
first
hey
i
do
understand
said
jack
quite
bewildered
you
must
love
her
and
believe
she
going
to
do
nice
things
and
be
proud
of
her
went
on
polly
steadily
how
can
i
she
such
a
little
beggar
exclaimed
jack
wo
study
and
all
that
and
you
must
make
her
the
very
best
friend
you
have
in
all
this
world
and
let
her
see
that
you
are
glad
that
she
is
your
sister
and
tell
her
things
and
never
never
scold
then
polly
stopped
and
the
color
flew
up
to
the
waves
of
brown
hair
on
her
brow
i
wish
you
go
on
said
jack
loughead
as
she
paused
oh
i
said
enough
said
polly
with
a
gasp
and
beginning
to
wish
she
could
be
anywhere
out
of
the
range
of
those
great
black
eyes
do
forgive
me
she
begged
i
did
mean
to
say
anything
to
hurt
you
jack
loughead
got
up
and
straightened
himself
i
much
obliged
to
you
miss
pepper
he
said
i
think
i
more
to
blame
than
amy
poor
child
no
no
cried
polly
getting
out
of
her
chair
i
did
mean
so
indeed
i
did
loughead
oh
what
have
i
said
i
think
you
have
done
beautifully
how
could
you
help
things
when
you
were
not
here
oh
loughead
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
have
only
made
matters
worse
i
afraid
and
poor
polly
face
drooped
jack
loughead
turned
with
a
sudden
gesture
perhaps
you
believe
me
when
i
say
i
never
had
anything
do
me
so
much
good
in
all
my
life
as
what
you
said
what
are
those
two
talking
about
all
this
unconscionable
time
joel
was
now
exclaiming
in
the
library
as
he
glanced
up
at
the
clock
i
could
finish
that
amy
loughead
in
the
sixteenth
of
a
minute
old
king
turned
uneasily
in
his
chair
who
is
this
young
loughead
he
asked
of
jasper
jasper
seeing
that
an
answer
was
expected
of
him
drew
himself
up
and
said
quickly
oh
he
the
brother
of
that
girl
at
the
salisbury
school
father
you
know
polly
goes
over
there
to
help
her
practice
ah
said
his
father
well
what
is
he
doing
here
this
morning
pray
tell
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
chimed
in
joel
well
last
evening
said
jasper
with
an
effort
to
make
things
right
for
polly
he
was
there
when
they
were
playing
and
he
seemed
quite
put
out
at
his
sister
do
wonder
said
joel
everybody
says
she
a
silly
and
polly
tried
to
help
amy
and
make
the
best
of
her
and
the
brother
asked
if
he
might
have
a
talk
some
time
about
his
sister
polly
help
telling
him
said
jasper
but
with
a
pang
at
the
handsome
stranger
delight
as
she
said
it
a
bad
business
said
the
old
gentleman
irritably
we
do
not
want
your
lougheads
coming
here
and
taking
up
our
time
of
course
not
declared
joel
and
i
suppose
he
is
an
idle
creature
polly
said
something
about
his
traveling
a
good
deal
it
a
very
bad
business
repeated
king
oh
he
all
right
in
a
business
way
said
jasper
feeling
angry
enough
at
himself
that
he
was
sorry
at
jack
loughead
success
he
has
to
travel
he
a
member
of
the
bradbury
and
graeme
company
the
sydney
australia
house
asked
king
in
a
surprised
tone
so
you
looked
him
up
have
you
jasper
oh
i
happened
to
run
across
hibbard
crane
yesterday
said
jasper
carelessly
and
he
gave
me
a
few
facts
that
about
all
i
know
father
and
in
came
polly
looking
like
a
rose
and
following
her
a
tall
young
man
with
large
black
eyes
whom
she
immediately
led
up
to
chair
grandpapa
she
said
this
is
loughead
amy
brother
you
know
and
jasper
went
forward
and
put
out
his
hand
as
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
evening
before
and
joel
was
introduced
and
mumbled
something
about
glad
to
know
you
immediately
retreating
into
the
corner
and
then
there
was
a
pause
which
polly
broke
by
crying
o
grandpapa
i
am
going
to
ask
amy
to
play
at
dunraven
for
phronsie
poor
children
why
where
is
phronsie
looking
around
the
room
oh
she
went
out
a
little
while
after
baby
exit
said
jasper
trying
to
speak
lightly
loughead
thinks
she
do
it
if
i
asked
her
polly
went
on
in
her
brightest
way
now
that
will
be
lovely
and
the
children
will
enjoy
it
so
much
is
there
anything
i
could
do
asked
jack
loughead
after
the
dunraven
entertainment
had
been
a
bit
discussed
king
bowed
his
courtly
old
head
i
do
believe
there
is
anything
you
are
very
kind
i
sure
do
speak
of
kindness
sir
he
said
my
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
just
now
he
would
like
to
be
with
his
sister
said
jasper
after
a
glance
at
polly
face
and
guilty
of
an
aside
to
his
father
oh
yes
said
king
to
be
sure
well
loughead
and
what
would

like
to
do
for
these
poor
children
of
phronsie
christmas

a
stereopticon
said
jack
no
very
new
idea
but
i
a
few
pictures
of
places

maybe
the
children
would
like
it
for
a
or
so
capital
capital
pronounced
the
old
gentleman
quite
as
if
he
had
proposed
it
and
before
any
one
knew
how
it
had
come
about
there
was
jack
loughead
talking
over
the
run
down
to
bedford
with
them
all
on
christmas
morning
as
a
matter
of
course
and
as
if
it
had
been
the
annual
affair
to
him
that
it
was
to
all
the
others
quite
a
fine
young
man
said
king
when
jack
had
at
last
run
off
with
a
bright
smile
and
word
for
all
and
phronsie
will
be
so
pleased
to

he
groaned
what

matter
cried
joel
rushing
up

jolly
face
aglow
the
worst
thing
that

possibly

said
king
irritably
phronsie
box
of
dolls

left
behind
then
he
began
to
fume
up
and
down
the
platform
wholly
lost
to
everything
but
his
indignation
whew
ejaculated
joel
that
is
a
miss
and
he
looked
down
at
phronsie
but
her

turning
off
to
the
little
knots
of
his

up
at

with
a
pale
face
oh

she
began
at

commotion
and

hurrying
up
with
what
is
it
and
oh

what
the

long
strides
to

around
the
station
and
david
and
the
other
harvard
fresh
who

sharply
that

a
big
train

added
with
a
forlorn
attempt
at
comfort
jack
loughead
sauntered
up
and
down
on
the
edge
of
the
group
longing
to

any

but

the
rush
of
travelers
from

she
forgot
all
about
her
late
unpleasantness
with
pickering

and
running
up
to
him
she
seized
his
arm

horrid
boy

till

a
long
day
before

assistance
said
pickering
lifting
his
cap
and
turning
on
his
heel
at
the
same
time
jasper
tried
to
get
up
to
polly
side
as
she
was
hurrying
phronsie
to
the
car
old
king
holding
fast
to
phronsie
other
hand
but
livingston
bayley
got
there
first

he
was
saying
with
extended
hand
me
word
it
a
beastly
crowd
going
sir
she
will
do
very
well
with
my
assistance
said
the
old
gentleman
still
holding
phronsie
little
glove
and
i
suppose
christmas
day
belongs
to
everybody
eh
bayley
hurrying
in
polly
her
foot
on
the
lower
step
turned
and
sent
a
despairing
glance
down
the
platform
and
jasper
who
saw
it
through
the
crowd
fell
back
a
little
to
give
a
last
look
for
joel
all
aboard
sang
out
the
conductor
waving
his
hand
come
oh
come
called
polly
with
a
frantic
gesture
from
the
doorway
of
the
car
as
the
train
moved
off
oh
jasper
as
he
swung
himself
up
beside
her
the
next
train
runs
down
in
an
hour
do
feel
badly
polly
jasper
had
time
to
beg
before
they
were
drawn
into
the
confusion
of
the
car
but
no
one
could
pretend
with
any
sort
of
success
that
joel
missed
and
polly
had
all
that
she
could
do
to
chase
away
the
sorrowful
expression
of
phronsie
little
face
and
everybody
tried
his
and
her
best
to
make
it
as
festive
a
time
as
possible
and
the
other
passengers
nudged
one
another
and
sent
many
an
envious
glance
at
the
merry
party
it
king
family
going
down
to
bedford
said
the
conductor
to
one
inquiring
mind
i
take
every
year
proudly
he
powerful
rich
but
this
ai
his
affair
it
all
to
that
little
girl
with
the
big
hat
then
he
dashed
off
and
called
a
station
and
after
the
stopping
and
moving
of
the
train
again
he
came
back
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
to
finish
his
account
you
see
there
was
an
old
lady
a
cousin
of
the
old
gentleman
and
she
made
a
will
in
favor
of
this
child
with
the
big
hat
the
conductor
pointed
his
thumb
at
phronsie
leaning
over
king
shoulder
the
better
to
hear
a
wonderful
story
he
was
concocting
for
her
benefit
why
she
got
some
two
or
three
millions
what
that
child
cried
the
listeners
in
amaze
illustration
joel
swinging
a
big
box
rushed
into
dunraven
hall
yes
the
old
lady
was
tough
but
he
dashed
off
again
called
a
station
slammed
the
door
and
was
back
in
position
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
she
was
took
sudden
while
king
folks
was
in
europe
and
now
that
child
has
turned
a
handsome
old
place
down
yonder
he
pointed
with
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
bedford
dunraven
lodge
the
old
lady
always
called
it
into
a
sort
of
a
home
and
she
chucked
it
full
of
children
mostly
those
whose
fathers
and
mothers
are
dead
and
every
christmas
day
king
takes
down
a
big
crowd
and
here
somebody
called
him
off
not
to
be
seen
again
till
he
put
his
head
in
the
doorway
and
shouted
bedford
joel
swinging
a
big
box
as
only
joel
could
rushed
into
the
spacious
hall
at
dunraven
lodge
how
are
you
all
phronsie
disentangled
herself
from
a
group
around
the
big
where
the
long
hickory
logs
snapped
and
blazed
oh
josey
she
cried
precipitating
herself
into
his
long
arms
here
is
the
toggery
cried
joel
setting
down
the
while
he
gathered
phronsie
up
in
his
arms
and
you
josey
cried
phronsie
with
a
happy
little
hum
you
are
all
here
yourself
as
the
group
left
the
fire
and
surrounded
them
well
well
well
cried
old
king
lifting
his
head
in
its
velvet
lounging
cap
from
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
napping
are
you
really
here
joe
just
like
you
greeted
alexia
running
down
the
broad
oaken
stairs

to
polly
appearing
at
the
head
we
were
finishing
the
tree
and
we
heard
the
noise
dear
me
joe
i
should
think
it
was
a
cyclone
as
she
joined
the
group
polly
close
behind
joel
tossed
her
a
saucy
answer
while
polly
got
on
her
tiptoes
and
caught
his
crop
of
short
black
hair
in
her
two
hands
oh
joe
she
said
dropping
a
kiss
on
it
it
was
lovely
in
you
to
go
back
joel
felt
well
repaid
for
losing
the
jolly
run
down
and
the
grand
into
dunraven
his
soul
loved
but
he
covered
up
what
he
thought
by
pulling
phronsie
into
the
middle
of
the
hall
come
on
phron
he
said
for
a
spin
like
old
times
see
here

alexia

get
back
to
that
tree
polly
pepper
or

wo

ready
dear
me
i
dropped
a
box
of
frost
all
over
the
stairs
joel
made
such
a
noise
at
the
mere
mention
of
such
a
possibility
as
the
tree
not
being
ready
everybody
started
the
last
one
in
the
procession
picking
up
the
their
movements
somewhat
quickened
as
loud
calls
were
now
set
up
above
stairs
for
polly
polly
come
on
sang
out
joel
who
had
paid
his
respects
in
a
flying
fashion
to
grandpapa
sofa
and
leaping
the
stairs
goodness

alexia
i
should
think
you
did
spill
this
frost
why
did
you
go
over
more
ground
i
do
believe
we
can
save
one
bit
mourned
alexia
peering
up
the
each
step
sparkling
with
myriad
little
frosty
gems
as
if
jack
frost
himself
had
sprinkled
it
with
a
christmas
hand
oh
dear
why
did
you
come
in
with
such
a
noise
joe
pepper
just
like
a
girl
said
joel
jumps
at
everything
and
drops
whatever
she
has
in
her
hand

the
other
stairs

sweep
this
in
a
minute
and

i
can
oh
joe

want
you
for
the
tree
begged
polly
phronsie
has
been
waiting
downstairs
all
this
time
for
you
to
come
let
one
of
the
maids
do
it
joe
already
had
his
head
in
a
closet
he
knew
of
old
opening
into
the
big
hall
give
me
the
broom
said
a
voice
close
beside
him
eh
what
cried
joel
pulling
out
what
he
wanted
a
soft
floor
brush
oh

that
you
loughead
turning
around

said
jack
laughing
here
give
me
the
broom
i
no

about
a
tree
i
have
the
stuff
up
there
soon
and
before
joel
knew
it
he
was
racing
over
the
back
stairs
wondering
how
it
was
he
had
let
that
disagreeable
jack
loughead
get
hold
of
that
broom
it
makes
me
think
of
our
first
tree
in
some
way
said
polly
softly
with
glistening
eyes
looking
up
at
the
beautiful
branching
spruce
its
countless
arms
shaking
out
brilliant
pendants
and
gay
with
streamers
and
candles
wherever
a
decoration
could
be
placed
the
whole
tipped
with
a
shining
star
oh
bensie
can
you
ever
forget
that
ben
looked
down
from
the
top
of
the
where
he
was
adjusting
some
last
bit
of
ornament
never
polly
he
said
his
eyes
meeting
hers
that
was
so
beautiful
cried
polly
and
we
had
it
in
our
room
and
henderson
brought
my
bird
over
and
the
other
things
the
last
minute
and
i
had
to
broke
in
henderson
with
a
laugh
and
shaking
the
snips
of
green
from
her
white
apron
for
you
and
ben
would
have
discovered
the
whole
surprise
you
were
dreadful
that
day
i
glad
somebody
else
was
dreadful
in
those
times
besides
me
observed
joel
from
among
the
branches
where
he
was
tying
on
the
several
presents
alexia
handed
to
him
well
you
see
said
polly
with
rosy
cheeks
it
was
our
first
tree
and
we
were
so
afraid
the
children
would
find
it
out
and
spoil
all
the
surprise
and
did
we
cried
phronsie
in
intense
excitement
emerging
from
the
depths
of
the
tree
the
better
to
look
at
polly
did
we
polly
and
spoil
it
all
no
pet
cried
polly
you
were
just
as
good
as
could
be
i
remember
said
joel
you
told
us
stories
polly
in
the
kitchen
and
we
tooted
on
our
tin
horns
finished
david
oh
joe
do
you
remember
those
horns
and
that
molasses
candy
said
joel
smacking
his
lips
i
remember
i
ate
mine
up
before
breakfast
and
did
i
have
any
asked
phronsie
turning
from
one
to
the
other
yes
indeed
you
did
answered
joel
why
did
you
think
we
forget
you
phronsie
asked
polly
a
bit
reproachfully
and
do
you
remember
it
said
david
no
said
phronsie
i
do
but
i
remember
seraphina
bonnet
it
was
trimmed
with
some
of
grandma
bascom
chicken
feathers
said
joel
and
mamsie
made
it
out
of
an
old
bonnet
string
said
polly
oh
dear
if
only
mamsie
were
here
and
a
cloud
came
over
her
face
but
we
baby
fisher
now
said
ben
cheerfully
looking
down
at
her
he
worth
staying
at
home
for
polly
of
course
he
is
said
polly
her
gayety
returning
and
dear
papa
fisher
was
master
of
ceremonies
then
but
he
would
enjoy
it
without
mamsie
so
we
ought
to
wish
him
here
illustration
and
did
we
cried
phronsie
find
it
out
polly
and
spoil
it
all
i
wish
you
would
begin
about
that
little
brown
house
and
what
elegant
times
you
had
in
it
exclaimed
alexia
twitching
at
a
present
joel
had
just
tied
on
to
be
sure
it
was
secure
i
shall
think
this
tree
is
perfectly
horrid
if
you
do
polly
pepper
go
on
do
go
on
begged
several
voices
meanwhile
jack
loughead
had
come
silently
up
into
the
long
hall
and
deposited
a
neat
boxful
of
the
gleaming
frost
on
the
table
without
any
comments
dear
me
there
is
so
much
to
tell
cried
polly
with
a
little
laugh
if
we
begin
about
jappy
tree
who
tree
cried
livingston
bayley
who
had
been
wrinkling
his
brows
in
great
perplexity
all
through
the
recital
why
jasper
said
polly
and
ben
together
joel
and
david
coming
in
as
echoes
you
see
said
phronsie
distinctly
that
jasper
and
dear
grandpapa
sent
the
beautiful
things
to
us
pepper
and
polly
and
ben
had
gotten
the
tree
ready
before
said
jasper
hastily
oh
did
i
want
to
be
there
he
added
yes
polly
almost
cried
because
you
could
be
said
joel
in
among
the
branches
but
she
could
quite
cry
said
davie
because
you
see
we
children
would
have
found
it
out
polly
always
sang
in
those
days
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
run
behind
the
when
we
wanted
to
plan
the
tree
polly
asked
ben
to
get
away
from
joel
and
dave
you
spent
most
all
your
time
in
the
little
brown
house
in
sneaking
off
from
us
said
joel
vindictively
well
we
had
to
if
we
ever
did
anything
said
ben
coolly
i
should
think
so
remarked
livingston
bayley
delighted
to
give
a
thrust
at
somebody
and
were
the
gilt
balls
pretty
cried
polly
quite
gone
now
in
the
reminiscences
though
her
fingers
kept
on
at
their
task
you
did
cover
those
nuts
beautifully
bensie
i
do
see
how
you
could
with
such
snips
of
paper
how
did
he
make
the
balls
asked
alexia
forgetting
herself
in
her
interest
and
coming
up
to
polly
why
we
had
some
bits
of
bright
paper
little
bits
you
know
and
ben
covered
hickory
nuts
with
them
and
pasted
them
all
as
smoothly
you
ca
think
oh
my
exclaimed
alexia
and
polly
strung
all
the
and
fixed
the
somebody
gave
mamsie
and
why
did
you
have
whole
ones
cried
alexia
why
we
could
said
polly
and
we
were
glad
enough
to
get
these
oh
the
tree
looked
just
beautifully
with
them
i
tell
you
you
see
said
phronsie
drawing
near
to
look
into
alexia
face
we
were
very
very
poor
alexia
so
polly
and
bensie
made
the
tree
you
understand
it
was
really
bensie
tree
said
polly
honestly
for
i
believe
at
first
we
could
do
it
oh
yes
you
did
polly
corrected
ben
hastily
at
any
rate
you
saw
it
in
a
minute
and
it
the
first
time
you
did
believe
a
thing
could
be
done
i
imagine
declared
jasper
with
a
bright
nod
at
polly
well
bensie
thought
of
this
tree
and
made
me
see
that
we
could
do
it
persisted
polly
giving
a
little
quirk
to
a
rebellious
pendant
henderson
put
the
corner
of
her
white
apron
to
her
eyes
i
always
have
to
she
said
to
dyce
when
the
little
brown
house
days
bring
those
blessed
children
back
to
me
jack
loughead
drew
nearer
yet
so
near
that
he
lost
never
a
word
you
ought
to
have
seen
what
a
santa
claus
ben
made
polly
was
saying
i
cut
your
performance
yesterday
at
baby
tree
all
out
old
fellow
declared
ben
descending
from
the
and
bestowing
an
affectionate
clap
on
jasper
shoulder
i
do
doubt
it
jasper
gave
back
we
made
the
wig
out
of
mamsie
cushion
hair
laughed
polly
and
we
had
such
a
piece
of
work
putting
it
all
back
the
next
morning
and
polly
shook
flour
all
over
me
for
the
snow
said
ben
laughing
come
back
alexia
and
hand
me
some
more
gimcracks
do
cried
joel
poking
his
head
out
of
the
branches
to
look
at
his
late
assistant
well
do
go
on
about
your
tree
in
the
brown
house
begged
alexia
tearing
herself
away
to
answer
joel
demands
seeing
you
have
begun
what
did
you
do
next
polly
well
we
all
marched
into
the
room
went
on
polly
her
cheeks
aglow
expecting
to
see
our
tree
just
as
we
had
left
it
all
but
ben
he
was
going
to
jump
into
the
window
at
the
right
time
when
the
first
thing
polly
sat
right
down
on
the
floor
saying
cried
joel
taking
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
i
could
help
it
i
was
so
surprised
said
polly
with
shining
eyes
there
was
a
most
beautiful
tree
full
of
just
everything
and
there
was
mamsie
almost
crying
she
was
so
happy
and
there
was
cherry
singing
away
in
his
cage
and
the
corner
of
the
room
was
all
with
flowers
and
and
grandma
bascom
was
there
was
she
funny
she
used
to
give
us
hard
old
raisins
sometimes
said
joel
afraid
to
show
what
he
was
feeling
and
phronsie
screamed
right
out
went
on
polly
and
davie
said
it
was
fairyland
by
this
time
alexia
had
dropped
the
present
she
was
holding
and
had
run
back
to
polly
side
again
and
somehow
most
of
the
other
workers
followed
her
example
the
circle
of
listeners
closing
around
the
little
bunch
of
peppers
and
jasper
sent
a
christmas
greeting
beside
the
tree
polly
ended

whirling
around

a
little
colored

perched

exclaimed
while
old
king
put
forth
an
uneasy
hand
to
stop
all
such
proceedings
and
two
or
three
of
the
others
hurried
up
to
remonstrate
with
joel
she
wants

said
phronsie
putting
her
cool
cheek
against
the
dark
little
one
it
the
new
child
that

yesterday
and
she
took
her
off
from
joel
shoulder
and
staggered
back
to
her
seat
by
side
phronsie
do
put
her
down
whispered
polly
it
almost
time
to
begin
glancing
off
at
the
clock
under
its
wealth
of
evergreen
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
here
do
let
me
take
her
but
phronsie
was
whispering
so
fast
that
she
did
hear
what
is
it
please

me
quickly
for
it
is
almost
time
to
have
the
tree
at
mention
of
the
tree
the
little
creature
sat
straight
in
white
lap
may

have
some
of
it
if

black
she
begged
her
beady
eyes
running
with
tears
yes
said
phronsie
i
tied
a
big
doll
on
it
for
you
my
very
own
self
then
she
put
her
lips
on
the
dark
little
cheek
now
you
must
get
down
for
i
have
to
talk
to
the
children
and
tell
them
all
about
things
and
why
they
have
a
christmas
but
the
little
thing
huddled
up
against
phronsie
the
only
one
that
black
she
said
i
want
to
stay
here
now
you
see
joel
began
old
king
harshly
phronsie
laid
a
soft
hand
on
his
arm
please
grandpapa
dear
may
she
have
a
little
cricket
up
here
she
feels
lonely
down
with
the
other
children
for
she
only
just
come
oh
dear
dear
groaned
polly
looking
down
at
the
little
black
object
in
phronsie
lap
now
what
shall
we
do
this
last
to
jasper
as
he
hurried
up
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
let
her
stay
he
began
when
phronsie
looks
like
that
she
wo
ever
let
her
go
declared
ben
with
a
wise
nod
over
at
the
two
she
just
as
determined
as
she
was
that
day
when
she
would
send
king
her
gingerbread
boy
cried
polly
clasping
her
hands
jasper
gave
her
a
bright
smile
i
would
worry
polly
he
said
see
joel
has
just
put
a
cricket
it
all
right
looking
into
troubled
eyes
phronsie
having
seated
her
burden
on
the
cricket
at
her
feet
got
out
of
her
own
chair
and
took
one
step
toward
the
platform
edge
beginning
dear
children
but
the
small
creature
left
behind
clutched
the
floating
hem
of
the
white
gown
and
screamed
harder
than
ever
bless
me
ejaculated
king
in
great
distress
here
will
somebody
take
this
child
down
where
she
belongs
while
polly
with
flushed
cheeks
leaned
over
and
tried
to
unclasp
the
little
black
fingers
go
up
there
joe
and
stop
the
row
said
livingston
bayley
from
the
visitor
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hall
you
started
it
jack
loughead
took
a
step
or
two
in
the
direction
of
the
platform
then
thought
better
of
it
and
got
back
into
his
place
again
hoping
no
one
had
noticed
him
in
the
confusion
phronsie
leaned
over
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
little
hands
pulling
her
back
jasper
she
begged
do
move
the
cricket
so
that
she
may
sit
by
me
and
before
anybody
quite
knew
how
it
was
done
there
was
the
new
child
sitting
on
her
cricket
and
huddled
up
against
the
soft
folds
of
phronsie
white
gown
while
phronsie
standing
close
to
the
platform
edge
began
again
dear
children
you
know
this
is
christmas
day
your
very
own
christmas
day
and
every
christmas
day
since
you
came
to
the
home
i
have
told
you
the
story
of
the
dear
beautiful
lady
and
every
single
christmas
i
am
going
to
tell
it
to
you
again
so
that
you
will
never
never
forget
her
here
phronsie
turned
and
pointed
up
to
a
large
portrait
of
chatterton
hanging
on
the
wall
over
the
platform
it
was
painted
in
her
youth
by
a
celebrated
french
artist
and
represented
a
beautiful
young
woman
in
a
yellow
satin
gown
whose
rich
folds
of
lace
fell
away
from
perfectly
molded
neck
and
arms
all
the
children
stared
at
the
portrait
as
usual
in
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
now
you
must
say
after
me
thank
my
beautiful
lady
for
this
home
said
phronsie
slowly
i
thank
my
beautiful
lady
for
this
home
said
every
child
distinctly
because
without
her
i
could
not
have
had
it
said
phronsie
you
must
always
remember
that
children
now
say
it
she
stood
very
patiently
her
hands
folded
together
and
waited
to
hear
them
repeat
it
because
without
her
i
could
not
have
had
it
said
the
children
one
or
two
coming
in
shrilly
as
a
belated
echo
illustration
will
you
asked
phronsie
looking
down
into
their
faces
and
i
thank
her
for
the
beautiful
tree
said
phronsie
now
say
it
please
i
thank
her
for
the
beautiful
tree
shouted
the
children
craning
their
necks
away
from
the
portrait
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
tree
in
the
other
room
please
ca
we
have
it
now
begged
several
voices
no
not
until
you
all
hear
the
story
well
now
god
took
the
beautiful
lady
away
to
heaven
but
she
is
always
going
to
be
here
too
again
phronsie
pointed
to
the
portrait
just
as
long
as
there
is
any
home
and
she
is
going
to
smile
at
you
because
you
are
all
going
to
be
good
children
and
try
to
study
and
learn
all
that
dear
henderson
teaches
you
and
you
are
going
to
obey
every
single
thing
that
dear
henderson
tells
you
just
as
soon
as
she
speaks
said
phronsie
slowly
and
turning
her
head
to
look
at
the
different
rows
i
hope
we
be
forgiven
for
sitting
here
and
listening
to
old
lady
chatterton
praises
whispered
hamilton
dyce
to
her
husband
it
makes
me
feel
dreadfully
wicked
to
swallow
it
all
without
a
protest
oh
we
swallowed
that
annually
for
three
years
now
said
dyce
with
a
little
laugh
and
grown
callous
your
face
is
just
as
bad
as
it
was
the
first
time
phronsie
eulogized
her
i
ca
help
it
declared
his
wife
when
i
think
of
that
dreadful
old
oh
come
remonstrated
her
husband
let
bury
the
past
phronsie
has
phronsie
ejaculated
dyce
oh
that
blessed
child
just
hear
her
now
so
on
this
christmas
day
phronsie
was
saying
in
clear
tones
you
are
to
remember
that
you
would
have
had
this
tree
but
for
the
beautiful
lady
and
on
every
single
other
day
you
must
remember
that
you
ever
have
had
this
home
not
a
bit
of
any
of
it
here
she
turned
and
looked
around
the
walls
and
out
of
the
long
windows
to
the
dark
pines
and
firs
of
the
broad
lawn
tossing
their
branches
but
for
the
beautiful
lady
and
you
must
every
one
of
you
help
to
make
this
home
just
the
very
best
home
that
ever
was
will
you
and
then
she
smiled
down
into
their
faces
while
she
waited
for
her
answer
oh
yes
yes
screamed
the
children
every
one
the
little
black
creature
got
off
from
her
cricket
at
phronsie
feet
to
look
into
her
face
and
i
will
too
she
cried
and
now
you
all
want
to
thank
miss
phronsie
for
her
kind
words
we
know
jasper
cried
at
this
point
hurrying
into
the
middle
of
the
aisle
and
so
children
you
may
all
stand
up
and
say
you
and
wave
your
handkerchiefs
up
flew
all
the
rows
of
children
to
their
feet
and
a
cloud
of
tiny
white
squares
of
cambric
fluttered
in
the
air
and
the
children
kept
piping
out
thank
you
thank
you
and
old
king
began
a
cheer
for
phronsie
and
another
for
the
children
and
then
somebody
down
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
set
up
another
for
king
and
somebody
else
started
one
for
henderson
and
another
for
henderson
and
there
was
plenty
of
noise
and
high
above
it
all
rang
the
peals
of
happy
childish
laughter
and
when
it
was
all
done
everybody
pausing
to
take
breath
then
amy
loughead
sent
out
the
finest
march
ever
heard
from
the
grand
piano
and
polly
and
jasper
and
all
the
rest
marshaled
the
children
into
a
procession
and
phronsie
clinging
to
old
king
hand
on
the
one
side
and
holding
fast
to
the
small
black
palm
on
the
other
away
they
all
went
the
visitors
falling
into
line
around
and
around
the
big
hall
till
at
last
oh
at
last
they
turned
into
the
enchanted
land
that
held
the
wonderful
christmas
tree
and
when
they
were
all
before
it
and
phronsie
in
the
center
she
lifted
her
hand
and
the
room
became
so
still
one
could
hear
a
pin
drop
and
then
the
little
children
who
had
sung
the
carols
in
the
morning
stepped
forward
and
began
it
came
upon
the
midnight
clear
that
glorious
song
of
old
and
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
and
folded
her
hands
not
stirring
till
the
very
last
word
died
on
the
air
and
then
jasper
and
the
others
slowly
drew
aside
the
white
curtain
and
oh
the
dazzling
beautiful
apparition
that
greeted
every
one
eyes
no
one
could
stop
the
children
noisy
delight
and
the
best
of
it
was
that
no
one
wanted
to
so
for
the
next
few
moments
it
was
exactly
like
the
merry
time
over
the
tree
in
the
provision
room
of
the
little
brown
house
years
ago
just
as
polly
had
said
only
there
was
ever
so
much
more
of
it
because
there
were
ever
so
many
more
children
to
make
it
and
polly
and
ben
were
like
children
again
themselves
and
david
and
joel
were
everywhere
helping
on
the
fun
in
which
excitement
the
other
harvard
man
and
even
livingston
bayley
were
not
ashamed
to
take
a
most
active
part
as
jasper
who
had
borrowed
santa
claus
attire
for
this
occasion
now
made
his
appearance
with
a
most
astonishing
bow
and
then
the
presents
began
to
fly
from
the
tree
and
jack
loughead
seemed
to
be
all
arms
for
he
was
so
tall
he
could
reach
down
the
hanging
gifts
from
the
higher
branches
so
that
he
was
in
great
demand
and
pickering
dodge
one
eye
on
all
of
polly
movements
worked
furiously
and
alexia
rhys
and
cathie
harrison
did
give
themselves
hardly
time
to
breathe
and
there
was
quite
enough
for
alstyne
and
the
cabots
and
hamilton
dyce
to
do
and
everybody
else
for
that
matter
to
pass
around
the
presents
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
a
big
doll
resplendent
in
a
red
satin
gown
and
an
astonishing
hat
was
untied
from
the
tree
o
i
want
to
give
it
to
her
myself
cried
phronsie
so
you
shall
declared
jasper
handing
it
to
her
susan
this
is
your
very
own
child
said
phronsie
turning
to
the
little
colored
girl
at
her
side
now
you
wo
feel
lonely
ever
will
you
and
she
laid
the
doll
carefully
into
the
outstretched
arms
and
at
last
the
green
branches
had
shaken
off
their
wealth
of
gifts
and
the
shining
candles
began
to
go
out
one
by
one
grandpapa
cried
polly
coming
up
to
old
king
and
phronsie
with
a
basket
of
mottoes
and
bonbons
enough
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
most
exacting
children
home
we
ought
to
get
our
paper
caps
on
bless
me
ejaculated
old
king
pulling
out
his
watch
it
ca
be
time
to
march
ah
it
a
quarter
of
four
this
minute
here
child
to
phronsie
pick
out
your
bonbon
so
that
i
can
snap
it
with
you
phronsie
gravely
regarded
the
pretty
bonbons
in
polly
basket
i
must
pick
out
yours
first
grandpapa
she
said
slowly
lifting
a
silver
arrangement
with
a
bunch
of
in
the
center
i
think
this
is
pretty
so
it
is
most
beautiful
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
in
great
satisfaction
now
we
must
crack
it
i
suppose
so
he
took
hold
of
one
end
and
phronsie
held
fast
to
the
other
of
the
bonbon
and
a
sharp
little
report
gave
the
signal
for
all
the
bonbons
to
be
opened
thereupon
everybody
old
and
young
hurried
to
secure
one
and
great
was
the
snapping
and
cracking
that
now
followed
oh
grandpapa
is
your
cap
pretty
exclaimed
phronsie
in
pleased
surprise
drawing
forth
a
pink
and
yellow
crinkled
tissue
bit
see
smoothing
it
out
with
a
gentle
hand
it
a
crown
grandpapa
now
that
perfectly
lovely
cried
polly
setting
down
her
basket
here
let
me
help
you
child
there
that
straight
now
grandpapa
please
bend
over
so
that
phronsie
can
put
it
on
instead
the
old
gentleman
dropped
to
one
knee
now
dear
he
said
gallantly
so
phronsie
set
the
pink
and
yellow
crown
on
his
white
hair
stepping
back
gravely
to
view
the
effect
it
is
so
very
nice
dear
grandpapa
she
said
coming
back
to
his
side
so
old
king
stood
up
with
quite
a
regal
air
and
phronsie
had
a
little
blue
and
white
paper
bonnet
tied
under
her
chin
by
own
hand
and
caps
were
flying
on
to
all
the
heads
and
each
right
hand
held
a
tinkling
little
bell
that
had
swung
right
merrily
on
a
green
and
away
to
amy
loughead
second
march
on
and
on
jangling
their
bells
the
procession
went
through
the
long
hall
till
old
king
and
phronsie
who
led
turned
down
the
broad
staircase
and
into
the
and
here
the
guests
stood
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
while
the
little
home
children
passed
up
through
their
midst
and
there
were
two
long
tables
one
for
the
home
children
with
a
place
for
phronsie
at
its
head
and
another
for
old
king
at
the
foot
and
the
other
table
was
for
the
older
people
both
gay
with
christmas
holly
and
sweet
with
flowers
and
when
all
were
seated
and
a
hush
fell
upon
the
big
room
phronsie
lifted
her
hand
thank
thee
oh
lord
for
this
christmas
day
and
may
we
love
thee
and
serve
thee
alway
for
jesus
christ
the
holy
child
sake
it
rang
out
clear
and
sweet
in
childish
treble
floating
off
into
the
halls
and
big
rooms
now
candace
phronsie
lifted
a
plate
of
biscuits
and
a
comfortable
figure
of
a
colored
woman
resplendent
in
the
gayest
of
turbans
and
a
smart
stuff
gown
made
its
appearance
by
phronsie
chair
i
here
honey
and
candace
broad
palm
received
the
first
plate
to
be
passed
which
opened
the
ceremony
of
the
christmas
feast
oh
this
christmas
feast
at
dunraven
it
surpassed
all
the
other
dunraven
christmases
on
record
everybody
said
so
and
at
last
when
no
one
could
possibly
eat
more
all
the
merry
roomful
young
and
old
must
have
a
holly
sprig
fastened
to
the
coat
or
gown
or
apron
and
the
procession
was
formed
to
march
back
to
the
hall
and
jack
stereopticon
flashed
out
the
most
beautiful
pictures
that
his
bright
descriptions
explained
to
the
delighted
children
and
then
games
and
romps
and
more
bonbons
and
favors
and
flowers
and
at
last
the
sleighs
and
barges
for
king
party
were
drawn
up
in
the
moonlight
at
the
door
of
dunraven
and
the
christmas
at
the
home
was
only
a
beautiful
memory
miss
mary
livingston
bayley
put
out
his
brown
driving
glove
this
way
trying
to
lead
her
off
from
the
gay
group
on
the
veranda
why
i
do
understand
began
polly
in
the
midst
of
trying
to
make
phronsie
see
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
back
and
comfort
susan
with
another
and
turning
a
bewildered
face
up
at
him
why
i
certainly
supposed
you
accepted
my
offer
to
drive
you
to
the
station
said
bayley
hurriedly
and
still
extending
his
hand
come
miss
pepper
come
polly
i
a
seat
for
you
cried
alexia
just
flying
into
the
biggest
barge
do
hurry
polly
polly
called
jasper
she
could
see
that
he
stood
by
one
of
the
sleighs
beckoning
to
her
meantime
phronsie
had
been
borne
off
by
old
king
and
polly
could
hear
her
say
somebody
get
polly
a
seat
please
i
considered
it
a
promise
livingston
bayley
was
saying
under
cover
of
the
gay
confusion
and
accordingly
i
prepared
myself
but
of
course
if
you
do
not
wish
to
fulfill
it
miss
pepper
why
i
oh
no
no
cried
polly
hastily
if
you
really
thought
i
promised
you
bayley
i
will
go
thank
you
and
without
a
backward
glance
at
the
others
she
moved
off
to
the
gay
little
cutter
where
the
horse
stood
shaking
his
bells
impatiently
where
polly
somebody
called
out
and
somebody
else
peered
down
the
row
of
vehicles
and
answered
bayley
driving
her
and
they
were
all
off
polly
kept
saying
to
herself
oh
dear
dear
what
could
i
have
said
to
make
him
think
i
would
go
with
him
and
livingston
bayley
smiled
happily
to
himself
under
the
collar
of
his
driving
coat
and
the
sparkling
snow
cut
into
little
crystals
by
the
horse
flying
feet
dashed
into
their
faces
and
the
scraps
of
laughter
and
merry
nonsense
from
the
other
sleighs
made
polly
want
nothing
so
much
as
to
cower
down
into
the
corner
of
the
big
fur
robes
for
a
good
cry
and
before
she
knew
it
bayley
had
turned
off
leaving
the
gay
procession
on
the
main
road
oh
cried
polly
then
and
starting
forward
bayley
why
off
the
road
i
know
a
short
cut
to
the
depot
he
answered
hastily
it
a
better
way
but
we
may
miss
the
train
oh
do
turn
back
and
overtake
them
begged
polly
in
a
tremor
this
is
a
vastly
better
road
said
bayley
and
instead
of
turning
back
he
flicked
the
horse
lightly
with
his
whip
you
say
miss
mary
that
it
much
better
this
way
he
tried
to
laugh
is
the
sleighing
superb
oh
yes
oh
dear
me
cried
poor
polly
straining
her
eyes
to
catch
a
sight
of
the
last
vehicle
with
its
merry
load
indeed
bayley
afraid
we
get
to
the
depot
in
time
there
may
be
drifts
on
this
road
or
something
to
delay
us
oh
no
indeed
cried
livingston
bayley
confidently
now
smiling
again
at
his
forethought
in
driving
over
this
very
identical
piece
of
roadway
when
the
preparations
for
the
christmas
festivity
were
keeping
all
the
other
people
busy
at
dunraven
and
leaving
him
free
to
provide
himself
with
sleighing
facilities
for
the
evening
do
be
troubled
i
know
all
about
it
i
assure
you
miss
mary
we
shall
reach
the
depot
as
soon
as
the
rest
of
the
party
do
for
it
really
a
shorter
cut
polly
beat
her
foot
impatiently
on
the
warm
he
had
wrung
with
difficulty
from
the
livery
keeper
and
counted
the
moments
unable
to
say
a
word
miss
mary
suddenly
livingston
bayley
turned
everything
is
forgiven
under
such
circumstances
i
believe
and
he
laughed
polly
did
speak
only
half
hearing
the
words
her
heart
on
the
rest
of
the
party
every
instant
being
carried
further
from
her
and
you
must
have
seen
me
word
it
is
impossible
that
you
see
that
that
oh
dear
burst
out
polly
suddenly
and
peering
anxiously
down
the
white
winding
highway
if
there
should
be
a
drift
on
the
road
livingston
bayley
bit
his
lip
angrily
me
word
miss
mary
he
began
you
are
the
first
girl
i
ever
cared
to
speak
to
and
now
you
ca
think
of
anything
but
the
roads
still
polly
peered
into
the
unbroken
whiteness
of
the
thoroughfare
lined
by
the
pines
and
spruces
all
inextricably
mixed
as
the
sleigh
spun
by
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
now
she
knew
the
best
that
could
be
done
was
to
hurry
on
and
she
began
to
count
the
and
to
speculate
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
would
see
the
lights
of
the
little
station
and
find
the
lost
party
again
i
might
have
spoken
to
a
great
many
other
girls
livingston
bayley
was
saying
and
i
really
do
know
why
i
did
choose
one
of
them
another
man
in
my
place
would
and
you
must
do
me
the
justice
to
acknowledge
it
me
word
you
must
miss
mary
polly
tore
off
her
gaze
from
the
snowy
fields
where
the
branches
of
the
trees
were
making
little
zigzag
paths
in
the
moonlight
to
fasten
it
on
as
much
of
his
face
as
was
visible
between
his
cap
and
his
high
collar
and
i
really
should
think
you
would
play
with
me
declared
bayley
nervously
fingering
the
i
should
do
you
know
because
you
are
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
do
that
thing
me
word
you
not
miss
mary
i
what
do
you
mean
cried
poor
polly
growing
more
and
more
bewildered
why
i
i
of
course
you
must
know
me
word
you
must
miss
mary
for
it
began
five
years
ago
before
you
went
abroad
do
you
know
polly
sank
back
among
her
fur
robes
while
he
went
on
and
i
done
what
no
other
fellow
would
i
sure
he
said
incoherently
in
my
place
kept
constant
do
you
know
to
one
idea
been
with
other
girls
of
course
but
only
really
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
you
me
word
i
did
miss
mary
and
you
brought
me
out
away
from
the
rest
of
the
party
to
tell
me
this
exclaimed
polly
springing
forward
to
sit
erect
with
flashing
eyes
how
good
of
you
bayley
to
announce
your
intention
to
marry
me
you
ca
blame
me
cried
bayley
in
an
injured
way
that
cad
of
a
loughead
means
to
speak
soon
me
word
the
fellow
does
and
never
changed
my
mind
about
it
since
i
made
it
up
even
when
you
began
to
give
music
lessons
oh
how
extremely
kind
cried
polly
do
put
it
that
way
he
began
deprecatingly
i
could
help
it
do
you
know
for
i
liked
you
awfully
from
the
first
and
always
intended
to
marry
you
you
shall
have
everything
in
the
world
that
you
want
and
go
everywhere
and
my
family
you
know
has
an
to
any
society
that
worth
anything
i
would
marry
you
cried
polly
stormily
if
you
could
give
me
all
the
gold
in
the
world
and
as
for
family
here
she
sat
quite
erect
with
shining
eyes
the
peppers
have
always
been
the
loveliest
people
that
ever
lived
the
very
loveliest
oh
she
broke
off
suddenly
starting
forward
there
something
on
the
road
see
mr
bayley
and
spinning
along
the
horse
now
making
up
his
mind
to
get
to
the
depot
in
time
they
both
saw
a
big
wagon
out
of
which
protruded
two
or
three
bags
evidently
containing
apples
and
potatoes
one
of
the
wheels
determining
to
perform
no
more
service
for
its
master
was
resting
independently
on
the
snowy
thoroughfare
for
horse
and
driver
were
gone
i
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
livingston
bayley
suddenly
at
sight
of
this
for
bringing
you
around
here
but
how
was
i
to
know
of
that
beastly
wreck
we
must
get
out
said
polly
springing
off
from
her
side
of
the
sleigh
and
lead
the
horse
around
but
this
was
not
so
easy
a
matter
for
the
farmer
wagon
had
stopped
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
road
either
side
shelving
off
under
its
treacherous
covering
of
snow
at
last
after
all
sorts
of
ineffectual
attempts
on
bayley
part
to
induce
the
horse
to
stir
a
step
polly
desperately
laid
her
hand
on
the
bridle
let
me
try
she
said
there
you
good
creature
patting
the
horse
nose
come
that
a
dear
old
fellow
and
they
never
knew
quite
how
but
in
the
course
of
time
they
were
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
wreck
and
livingston
bayley
was
helping
her
into
the
sleigh
and
showering
her
with
profuse
apologies
for
the
whole
thing
never
mind
said
polly
as
she
saw
his
distress
only
never
say
such
perfectly
dreadful
things
to
me
again
and
now
hurry
just
as
fast
as
you
can
please
and
presently
a
swift
turn
brought
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
little
station
to
view
and
there
was
the
entire
party
calling
to
them
as
they
now
spied
their
approach
to
hurry
up
and
there
also
was
the
train
holding
its
breath
in
curbed
impatience
to
be
off
chapter
bad
news
oh
mamsie
cried
polly
in
dismay
must
papa
fisher
know
certainly
said
fisher
firmly
your
father
must
be
told
every
thing
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
turning
off
in
dismay
it
seems
so
so
unfair
to
bayley
might
it
be
just
as
if
he
had
spoken
mamsie
she
came
back
now
to
her
mother
side
and
looked
anxiously
into
the
black
eyes
but
he
has
spoken
said
mother
fisher
and
your
father
must
be
told
why
polly
that
is
like
you
child
to
want
to
keep
anything
from
him
she
added
reproachfully
oh
i
do
i
could
ever
in
all
this
world
keep
anything
from
father
fisher
declared
polly
vehemently
only
and
the
color
flew
in
rosy
waves
over
her
face
this
does
seem
like
my
secret
mamsie
and
bayley
would
feel
so
badly
to
have
it
known
and
her
head
drooped
still
it
must
be
known
by
your
father
said
her
mother
firmly
and
i
must
tell
king
then
it
need
go
no
further
oh
mamsie
exclaimed
polly
in
a
sharp
tone
of
distress
you
would
ever
in
all
this
world
tell
grandpapa
i
most
certainly
shall
declared
fisher
he
ought
to
know
everything
that
concerns
you
polly
and
each
one
of
you
children
it
is
his
right
polly
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
grandpapa
will
show
bayley
that
he
does
like
it
she
mourned
and
it
will
hurt
his
feelings
fisher
lip
curled
no
more
do
i
like
it
she
said
curtly
in
the
first
place
to
speak
to
you
at
all
and
then
to
take
such
a
way
to
do
it
it
was
a
nice
thing
at
all
child
for
bayley
to
do
here
fisher
walked
to
the
window
her
irritation
getting
the
better
of
her
so
that
polly
might
not
see
her
face
but
he
did
mean
to
speak
then
that
is
began
polly
he
should
have
spoken
to
your
father
or
to
king
said
fisher
coming
back
to
face
polly
but
i
presume
the
young
man
did
know
any
better
or
at
least
he
did
think
and
that
enough
to
say
about
that
but
as
for
not
telling
king
about
it
why
it
is
to
be
thought
of
for
a
minute
so
i
best
have
it
over
with
at
once
and
with
a
reassuring
smile
at
polly
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
oh
dear
me
cried
poor
polly
left
alone
and
springing
out
of
her
chair
she
began
to
pace
the
floor
now
it
will
be
perfectly
dreadful
for
bayley
grandpapa
will
be
very
angry
he
never
liked
him
and
now
he
ca
help
showing
what
he
feels
oh
why
did
bayley
speak
polly
called
jasper
voice
out
in
the
hall
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
like
running
away
from
his
call
oh
i
ca
go
out
he
guess
something
is
the
matter
she
cried
to
herself
polly
and
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
yes
said
polly
from
within
can
i
see
you
a
minute
polly
slowly
opened
the
door
and
tried
to
lift
her
brown
eyes
to
his
face
oh
polly
he
pretended
not
to
notice
any
thing
amiss
with
her
i
came
to
tell
you
first
and
you
can
help
me
to
break
it
to
father
oh
what
is
it
cried
polly
looking
up
quickly
oh
jasper
as
she
saw
that
his
face
was
drawn
with
the
effort
not
to
let
her
see
the
distress
he
was
in
he
tried
to
cover
up
his
anxiety
but
she
saw
a
yellow
paper
in
his
hand
oh
jasper
you
a
telegram
she
cried
breathlessly
polly
said
jasper
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
firmly
you
will
help
father
and
me
to
bear
it
i
know
oh
jasper
i
will
promised
polly
clinging
to
his
hand
do
be
afraid
to
tell
me
jasper
listen
marian
has
been
thrown
from
her
sleigh
this
morning
the
horses
ran
said
jasper
hurriedly
the
telegram
says
she
may
be
living
polly
do
look
so
for
the
room
grew
suddenly
so
dark
to
her
that
she
wavered
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
caught
her
i
wo
faint
she
cried
jasper
do
be
afraid
there
i
all
right
now
oh

i
do
could
you
go
with
me
when
i
tell
father
asked
jasper
i
am
so
afraid
i
shall
break
it
to
him
too
sharply
and
you
know
it
wo
do
for
him
to
be
startled
if
you
could
polly
for
the
second
time
everything
seemed
to
turn
black
before
her
eyes
but
polly
said
bravely
yes
i
go
jasper
and
presently
they
hardly
knew
how
the
two
found
themselves
at
old
king
door
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
within
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
i
forgot
mamsie
was
here
jasper
looked
his
surprise
but
said
nothing
and
as
they
stood
there
irresolutely
fisher
opened
the
door
and
came
out
why
polly
she
exclaimed
oh
fisher
cried
jasper
we
ca
explain
now
we
must
see
father
but
polly
will
go
and
tell
you
and
in
another
minute
they
were
both
standing
before
king
the
old
gentleman
was
walking
up
and
down
his
apartment
fuming
at
every
step
the
presumption
of
the
fellow
how
did
he
dare
without
speaking
to
me
oh
eh
polly
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
jasper
back
of
her
father
began
jasper
i
had
a
telegram
from
brother
mason
oh
now
what
has
he
been
doing
cried
king
irritably
i
do
wish
mason
would
be
so
abrupt
in
his
movements
i
suppose
he
is
going
abroad
again
well
let
hear
jasper
tried
to
speak
but
instead
looked
at
polly
dear
grandpapa
cried
polly
going
unsteadily
to
the
old
side
and
taking
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
oh
we
must
tell
you
something
very
bad
and
we
do
know
how
to
tell
it
grandpapa
she
looked
up
piteously
into
his
face
old
king
put
forth
his
other
hand
and
seized
the
back
of
a

the

and
bid

alexia
and
some
of
the
other
girls
were
hurrying
in
the
east
doorway
of
the
king
mansion
an
hour
later
oh
where
polly
mrs
fisher
cried
cathie
harrison
polly
has
gone
said
fisher
coming
down
the
stairs
she
looked
as
if
she
wanted
to
cry
but
her
hands
held
the
basket
of
sewing
as
firmly
as
if
no
bad
news
had
fallen
upon
the
home
gone
cried
all
the
girls
oh
fisher
where
do
tell
us
where
polly
is
for
answer
fisher
made
them
all
go
into
the
little
reception
room
in
an
angle
of
the
hall
where
she
told
them
the
whole
story
if
that
is
perfectly
dreadful
cried
alexia
rhys
throwing
her
muff
into
a
chair
and
herself
on
an
ottoman
why
we
were
going
to
make
up
a
theater
party
for
night
fisher
and
now
polly
is
gone
her
look
of
dismay
was
copied
by
every
girl
so
exactly
that
fisher
had
no
relief
in
turning
to
any
of
the
other
four
and
there
is
her
recital
what
will
she
do
about
that
cried
alexia
rushing
on
in
her
complaint
perhaps
she
give
it
up
after
all
she
added
brightening
now
i
most
know
she
will
fisher
and
she
started
up
and
began
to
pirouette
around
the
room
of
course
she
has
had
to
postpone
it
said
fisher
looking
after
her
and
she
told
joel
to
write
the
notes
to
the
pupils
explaining
matters
but
never
you
fear
alexia
that
polly
will
give
up
that
recital
for
good
and
all
she
added
with
a
wise
nod
at
her
well
she
must
give
it
up
for
now
anyway
said
alexia
coming
to
a
pause
to
take
breath
that
some
comfort
to
think
of
joe
writing
polly
notes
to
the
girls
oh
dear
me
let
us
go
and
help
him
proposed
cathie
harrison
suddenly
he
must
hate
to
do
such
poky
work
oh
dear
me
began
alexia
taking
up
her
little
bag
to
look
at
the
tiny
watch
in
one
corner
we
have
the
time
yes

on
she
burst
out
incoherently
where
is
he
mrs

in
the
library
hard
at
work
said
fisher
with
a
bright
smile
at
them
all
come
on
girls
said
alexia
rushing
on
now
that
what
i
admire
fisher
for
she
said
when
they
were
well
in
the
hall
she
shows
when
she
not
pleased
and
when
she
likes
what
a
body
does
as
well
i
think
she
just
elegant
declared
cathie
harrison
who
had
privately
done
a
good

a

to
pile
the
books
on
a
chair
as
he
went
around
to
alexia
place
she
looked
up
and
fixed
her
gaze
past
him
not
noticing
his
attempt
to
speak
all
right
if
she
wants
to
act
like

i
willing
said
pickering
to
himself
savagely
and
coolly
going
on

smothered
a
retort
and
bit

alexia
pulling

joel
that

she
hoped

and
she
would
write
them
from
new
york
oh
joe
what
a
lot
exclaimed
alexia
leaving
her
pen
poised
in
mid
air
cut
it
short
then
said
joel
i
do
care
only
that
the
sense
of
it
oh
dear
began
one
of
the
girls
i
ca
bear
to
write
of
the
accident
and
in
the
holidays
too
alexia
made
an
uneasy
gesture
scrawled
two
or
three
words
then
threw
down
her
pen
and
got
out
of
her
chair
it
no
use
she
cried
running
up
to
pickering
who
his
hands
in
his
pockets
had
his
back
to
them
all
and
was
looking
out
of
the
window
i
ca
let
myself
do
anything
till
i
said
i
sorry
i
was
so
cross
and
she
put
out
her
hand
eh
exclaimed
pickering
whirling
around
in
astonishment
oh
dear
me
and
he
pulled
his
right
hand
out
of
his
pocket
and
extended
it
to
her
whitney
has
got
hurt
and
she
was
always
sweet
and
never
said
cross
things
and
oh
dear
me
cried
alexia
incoherently
as
he
shook
her
hand
violently
and
i
glad
enough
to
have
it
made
up
declared
pickering
decidedly
it
bad
enough
to
have
so
much
trouble
in
the
world
without
getting
into
fights
with
people
you
known
ever
since
you
can
remember
trouble
repeated
alexia
wonderingly
oh
yes
accident
you
mean
i
know
it
awful
for
all
of
us
pickering
dodge
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
abruptly
and
she
ran
back
to
her
work
with
a
final
stare
at
him
i
know
now
she
said
to
herself
wisely
and
i
been
mean
enough
to
hurt
him
when
he
was
bearing
it
oh
dear
me
things
are
getting
so
mixed
up
polly
you
wo
leave
me
will
you
till
i
get
able
to
sit
up
cried
whitney
one
day
a
week
after
no
aunty
indeed
i
wo
declared
polly
leaning
over
to
drop
a
kiss
on
the
soft
hair
against
the
pillows
whitney
put
up
her
hands
to
draw
down
the
young
face
oh
aunty
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
be
careful
you
know
doctor
said
you
must
raise
your
arms
well
just
let
me
kiss
you
dear
then
said
whitney
with
a
wan
little
smile
oh
polly
when
the
kiss
and
two
or
three
others
had
been
dropped
on
the
rosy
cheek
you
are
sure
you
can
stay
with
me
i
sure
i
can
and
i
will
said
polly
firmly
oh
aunty
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
be
with
you
you
ca
think
how
glad
she
softly
patted
the
pillows
into
the
position
whitney
best
liked
and
then
stood
off
a
bit
and
beamed
at
her
it
dreadfully
selfish
in
me
to
keep
you
said
whitney
when
you
love
your
work
so
and
what
will
the
music
scholars
do
polly
oh
they
are
all
right
said
polly
gaily
they
working
like
beavers
indeed
aunty
i
believe
they
practice
a
great
deal
more
than
if
i
were
home
to
be
talking
to
them
all
the
while
you
are
a
dear
blessed
comfort
polly
said
whitney
turning
on
her
pillow
with
a
sigh
of
relief
now
i
do
believe
i
shall
get
up
very
soon
but
jasper
must
go
back
it
wo
do
for
him
to
stay
away
any
longer
from
his
business
promise
me
polly
that
you
will
make
him
see
that
he
ought
to
go
i
try
aunty
said
polly
and
now
that
you
are
so
much
better
why
i
do
believe
that
jasper
will
be
willing
to
go
oh
do
make
him
begged
whitney
and
then
she
tucked
her
hand
under
her
cheek
and
the
first
thing
polly
knew
she
heard
the
slow
regular
breathing
that
told
she
was
asleep
now
that
just
lovely
cried
polly
softly
and
i
will
run
and
speak
to
jasper
this
very
minute
for
he
really
ought
to
go
back
to
his
business
but
instead
of
doing
this
she
met
a
young
girl
as
she
was
running
through
the
hall
who
stopped
her
and
asked
can
i
see
mr
king
what
cried
polly
astonished
that
the
domestics
had
admitted
any
one
as
it
was
against
the
orders
oh
i
am
a
relation
said
the
girl
coolly
and
i
told
the
man
at
the
door
that
i
should
come
in
and
he
said
then
i
must
wait
for
i
could
not
see
king
now
and
he
put
me
up
in
that
little
reception
room
but
i
just
walked
out
to
meet
the
first
person
coming
in
the
hall
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
arrange
it
she
looked
as
if
she
fully
expected
to
have
her
wish
fulfilled
and
her
gaze
wandered
confidently
around
the
wall
until
such
time
as
polly
could
answer
i
see
said
polly
who
could
help
smiling
what
i
can
do
for
you
but
you
must
be
disappointed
if
grandpapa
does
feel
able
to
see
you
he
is
very
much
occupied
you
know
with
his
daughter
ill
oh
i
understand
said
the
other
girl
guilty
of
interrupting
but
he
will
see
me
i
know
and
her
light
blue
eyes
were
as
calm
as
ever
who
shall
i
tell
him
wants
to
see
him
asked
polly
her
own
eyes
wide
at
the
stranger
and
her
ways
oh
you
need
tell
him
any
name
said
the
girl
carelessly
then
i
certainly
shall
not
tell
him
you
wish
to
see
him
unless
i
carry
your
name
to
him
polly
said
quite
firmly
and
she
looked
steadily
into
the
fair
face
before
her
oh
dear
me
said
the
girl
well
you
may
say
i
am
alexander
chatterton
daughter
charlotte
polly
kept
herself
from
starting
as
the
name
met
her
ear
very
well
she
said
i
will
do
what
i
can
moving
off
o
grandpapa
for
down
the
hall
came
king
in
velvet
morning
jacket
and
cap
i
thought
no
one
was
to
be
admitted
he
exclaimed
as
he
neared
the
door
grandpapa
polly
endeavored
to
draw
him
off
but
the
young
girl
ran
past
her
king
she
said
quickly
i
am
charlotte
chatterton
the
dickens
you
are
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
looking
her
full
in
the
face
yes
sir
and
my
father
is
very
for
a
moment
her
voice
trembled
but
she
quickly
recovered
herself
it
is
money
i
want
king
and
she
threw
her
head
back
proudly
but
oh
will
you
come
and
see
father
king
looked
at
her
again
then
over
at
polly
bring
her
in
here
he
said
pointing
to
the
same
little
reception
room
that
charlotte
had
deserted
i
want
you
to
stay
too
polly
and
the
door
closed
upon
them
chapter
vi
of
many
things
and
father
has
asked
her
to
go
home
when
you
and
he
go
cried
jasper
in
irritation
yes
said
polly
oh
jasper
never
mind
i
daresay
it
will
be
for
the
best
and
i
so
sorry
for
charlotte
she
be
no
end
of
bother
to
you
i
know
said
jasper
and
you
must
take
her
everywhere
polly
and
look
out
for
her
what
was
father
thinking
of
he
could
not
conceal
his
annoyance
and
polly
put
aside
her
own
dismayed
feelings
at
the
new
programme
to
help
him
into
his
usual
serene
mood
but
think
jasper
how
she
has
never
had
any
fun
all
her
life
and
now
her
father
is
sick
she
much
better
stay
and
take
care
of
him
declared
jasper
but
he
sick
because
he
has
worried
so
i
do
believe
polly
went
on
for
you
ought
to
have
seen
his
face
when
we
took
charlotte
home
and
grandpapa
talked
with
him
and
asked
him
to
let
charlotte
pass
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
us
oh
i
am
glad
jasper
for
i
do
like
charlotte
the
girl
may
be
well
enough
said
jasper
shortly
but
she
will
bother
you
nevertheless
polly
i
am
afraid
never
mind
said
polly
brightly
with
a
little
pang
at
her
heart
for
the
nice
times
with
the
girls
that
now
must
be
shared
with
another
grandpapa
thought
he
ought
to
do
it
i
suppose
and
that
enough
it
does
seem
as
if
the
chattertons
would
never
be
done
annoying
us
said
jasper
gloomily
now
when
we
once
get
this
girl
fastened
on
us
there
be
an
end
to
the
hope
of
shaking
her
off
perhaps
we
want
to
said
polly
merrily
for
charlotte
may
turn
out
perfectly
lovely
i
do
believe
she
going
to
and
then
she
remembered
her
promise
to
whitney
and
she
began
aunty
is
worrying
about
your
staying
away
so
long
from
your
business
jasper
and
she
wants
you
to
go
back
a
shade
passed
over
his
face
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
polly
he
said
and
he
pulled
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
her
i
was
going
to
show
this
to
you
only
the
other
matter
came
up
polly
seized
it
with
dread
we
need
your
services
very
much
the
letter
ran
and
can
not
wait
longer
for
your
return
we
are
very
sorry
to
be
so
imperative
but
the
rush
of
work
at
this
time
of
the
year
makes
it
necessary
for
all

jasper
about

laughed
the

he
said

on
the
road
repeated
polly
in
amaze
oh

the
business
of

a
good
part
of
it
done
by
salesmen
who
travel
with
samples
and
take
advance
orders
said
jasper
finding
it
quite
jolly
to
explain
business
intricacies
to
such
an
eager
listener
oh

polly
and
when

get
back
i
shall
be
plunged
at

into
all
the
thick
of
the
manufacturing
work
he
went
on
straightening
himself
up
marlowe

as
good
as

be
and
he
has
waited

longer
than
he
ought
to
oh

jasper
cried
polly
quickly
at
once
this
very
day
and
her
face
glowed
if

me
he
said
trying
to
restrain
his
impatience
to
be

polly
doctor

her
jasper

law
that
you
percy
i
say
i
would
try

things
on
with
a
laugh
as
he
saw
his
brother
ineffectual
efforts
to
pack
and
yet
give
the
attention
to
his
eyeglasses
that
they
seemed
to
demand

out

his
laugh
oh

that
a
dear

and
in
five
minutes
polly

busily
working
together
he
putting
in
the
things
while
she
neatly
made
them
into
piles
and
percy
sorted
and
gave
orders
like
a
general
he

said
van
under

and
he
going

to
college
and

van
swallowed
something
in
his
throat
and
bent
all
his
energies
to
settling
the
different
articles
in
the
trunk
percy
said
polly
presently
in
a
lull
i
do
just
envy
you
for
one
thing
what
for
pray
asked
percy
settling
his
beloved
eyeglasses
for
a
better
view
of
her
why
you
be
with
joel
and
davie
said
polly
oh
you
do
know
how
i
miss
those
boys
she
rested
both
hands
on
the
trunk
edge
as
she
knelt
before
it
illustration
oh
you
do
know
how
i
miss
those
boys

our
sister
said
van
enviously
then
we
have
had
good
times
always
oh
i
do
see
much
of
joel
said
percy
dave
once
in
a
while
i
run
across
but
joel
dear
me
you
do
see
much
of
joel
repeated
polly
her
hands
dropping
suddenly
in
astonishment
why
percy
whitney
why
not
pray
tell
why
joel
awful
good
got
a
streak
of
going
into
the
and
that
sort
of
thing
explained
percy
and
we
call
him
deacon
pepper
in
the
class
he
goes
to
and
you
call
him
deacon
pepper
repeated
polly
in
amazement
while
van
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
amusement
yes
said
percy
and
he
has
a
lot
of
old
fogies
always
turning
up
that
want
help
and
all
such
stuff
and
i
expect
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
minister
he
brought
this
out
as
something
too
dreadful
to
be
spoken
and
then
fell
back
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
can
you
suppose
it
cried
polly
under
her
breath
still
kneeling
on
the
floor
oh
boys
can
you
looking
from
one
to
the
other
yes
i
afraid
it
true
said
percy
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
thrashed
for
having
told
her
while
van
laughed
again
oh
oh
it
too
lovely
dear
beautiful
old
joel
cried
polly
springing
suddenly
to
her
feet
just
think
how
good
he
is
boys
oh
it
too
lovely
to
be
true
percy
retreated
a
few
steps
hastily
and
oh
how
much
better
we
ought
to
be
cried
polly
in
a
rush
of
feeling
just
think
with
joel
doing
such
beautiful
things
oh
how
glad
mamsie
will
be
and
he
never
told
joel
never
told
and
he
just
about

out
said
percy
abruptly
oh

how
he
pitch
into
me
exclaimed
percy
in
alarm
i
never
shall
speak
of
it
declared
polly
in
a
rapture
because
joel
always
hated
to
be
praised
for
being
good
but
oh
how
lovely
it
is
and
then
grandpapa
called
and
she
ran
off
on
happy
feet
whew
exclaimed
percy
with
a
look
over
at
van
i
tell
you
what
if
you
want
to
get
into
polly
good
graces

off
uneasily
nor
suppers
and
a
bit
of
eh
percy
hold
your
tongue
will
you
cried
his
brother
irritably
nor
swell
clothes
and
a
manner
said
van
mockingly
sticking
his
fingers
in
his
vest
pockets
percy
made
a
lunge
at
him
then
thought
better
of
it
leave
me
alone
ca
you
he
said
crossly
van
opened
his
mouth
to
toss
back
a
teasing
reply
when
percy
opened
up
on
him
i
as
soon
take
my
chances
with
her
on
the
suppers
and
other
things
as
to
have
yours
what

polly
say
to
see
you
going
for
me
like
this
i
like
to
know
it
was
now
van
turn
to
look
uncomfortable
and
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
door
oh
she
may
come
in
said
percy
bursting
into
a
laugh
then
you
be
in
a
fine
fix
and
i
would
give
a
rush
for
the
good
opinion
have
of
you
van
hung
his
head
took
two
or
three
steps
to
the
door
then
came
back
hurriedly
i
cry
percy
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
all
right
said
percy
smoothing
down
his
ruffled
feelings
and
putting
out
his
hand
too
van
seized
it
wrung
it
in
good
brotherly
fashion
then
raced
over
the
stairs
at
a
breakneck
pace
polly
he
said
meeting
her
in
the
hall
where
she
had
just
come
from
king
room
i
been
blackguarding
percy
and
you
ought
to
know
it
oh
van
cried
polly
stopping
short
in
a
sorry
little
way
why
you
been
so
good
ever
since
you
both
promised
years
ago
that
you
would
say
bad
things
to
each
other
oh
that
was
different
said
van
recklessly
but
since
he
went
to
college
percy
has
been
a
perfect
snob
polly
polly
said
nothing
only
looked
at
him
in
a
way
that
cut
him
to
the
heart
as
she
moved
off
slowly
are
you
going
to
say
anything
asked
van
at
last
i
nothing
to
say
replied
polly
and
she
disappeared
into
whitney
room
and
closed
the
door
that
evening
jasper
and
percy
who
went
together
for
a
good
part
of
the
way
had
just
driven
to
the
station
when
the
bell
rang
and
a
housemaid
presently
laid
before
polly
a
card
at
sight
of
which
all
the
color
deserted
her
cheek
oh
i
ca
see
him
she
declared
involuntarily
who
is
it
asked
old
king
laying
down
the
evening
paper
o
grandpapa
cried
polly
all
in
a
tremor
at
the
thought
of
his
displeasure
it
does
not
matter
i
can
send
word
that
i
do
not
see
any
one
now
that
aunty
is
ill
and
polly
child
said
the
old
gentleman
seriously
displeased
come
and
tell
me
at
once
who
has
called
upon
you
so
polly
hardly
knowing
how
got
out
of
her
chair
and
silently
laid
the
unwelcome
card
in
his
hand
livingston
bayley
read
the
old
gentleman
humph
well
upon
my
word
this
speaks
well
for
the
young
perseverance
i
very
tired
but
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
that
i
must
respond
to
this
and
he
threw
aside
the
paper
and
got
up
to
his
feet
grandpapa
begged
polly
tremblingly
at
his
elbow
please
do
let
him
feel
badly
it
is
possible
polly
cried
king
looking
down
at
her
that
you
like
this
fellow
enough
i
mean
to
marry
him
o
grandpapa
exclaimed
polly
in
a
tone
of
horror
well
then
child
you
must
leave
me
to
settle
with
him
said
the
old
gentleman
with
dignity
do
worry
i
forget
myself
nor
what
is
due
to
a
bayley
with
a
short
laugh
and
then
she
heard
him
go
into
the
and
close
the
door
when
he
came
back
which
he
did
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
his
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
and
he
chuckled
now
and
then
as
he
sat
down
in
his
big
chair
and
drew
out
his
eyeglasses
well
polly
child
i
do
believe
he
will
trouble
you
in
this
way
again
my
dear
he
said
in
a
satisfied
way
looking
at
her
over
the
table
he
wanted
to
leave
the
question
open
thought
it
impossible
that
you
could
refuse
him
utterly
and
was
willing
to
wait
and
asked
permission
to
send
flowers
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
made
the
young
man
see
exactly
how
the
matter
stood
and
that
all
that
need
be
said
about
it
it
done
with
now
and
forever
and
then
he
took
up
his
paper
and
began
to
read
mamsie
said
phronsie
that
very
evening
as
she
was
getting
ready
for
bed
and
pausing
in
the
doorway
of
her
little
room
that
led
out
of
mother
fisher
do
you
suppose
we
can
bear
it
another
day
without

why

phronsie
said
mother
fisher
giving
another
gentle
rock
to
baby
cradle
of

we
can
because

is
like
you
dear
to
want
polly
back
till
aunty

got
through
needing
her
phronsie
gave
a
sigh
and
thoughtfully
drew
her
slippered
foot
over
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
it
would
be
so
very
nice
she
said
if
aunty
did
need
her
so
it
would
said
her
mother
but
it
wo
make
polly
come
any
quicker
to
spend
the
time
wishing
for
her
there
run
to
bed
child
you
are
half
an
hour
late
phronsie
turned
obediently
into
her
own
little
room
then
came
back
softly
i
want
to
give
baby
polly
kiss
she
said
very
well

may
dear
said
fisher
so
phronsie
bent
over
and
set
on
baby
dear
little
cheek
the
kiss
that
could
not
go
to
polly
if
dear
grandpapa
would
only
come
home
and
she
sighed
again
but
just
think
how
beautiful
it
is
that
aunty
was
not
hurt
so
much
as
the
doctors
feared
said
her
mother
oh
phronsie
we
ca
ever
be
thankful
enough
for
that
and
now
maybe
god
will
let
grandpapa
and
polly
come
back
pretty
soon
said
phronsie
slowly
going
off
toward
her
own
little
room
and
presently
fisher
heard
her
say
mamsie
dear
i
in
bed
a
rap
at
the
door
and
jane
put
in
her
head
in
response
to
fisher
what
is
it
oh
is
fisher
here
asked
jane
in
a
frightened
way
illustration
and
please
make
dear
papa
give
her
the
right
things
no
he
is
downstairs
in
the
library
said
mother
fisher
what
is
the
matter
jane
who
wants
him
oh
something
dreadful
is
the
matter
with
helen
fargo
i
afraid
said
jane
griggs
has
just
run
over
to
say
that
the
doctor
must
come
quick
hush
said
fisher
pointing
to
phronsie
door
but
she
was
standing
beside
them
in
her
little
nightdress
and
heard
the
next
words
plainly
enough
run
down
stairs
jane
commanded
mother
fisher
and
tell
the
doctor
what
griggs
said
just
as
fast
as
you
can
jane
and
in
another
minute
in
rushed
the
little
doctor
seized
his
medicine
case
saying
as
he
did
so
i
come
back
here
wife
if
it
is
diphtheria
but
go
to
my
office
and
change
my
clothes
considerable
of
the
disease
around
child
he
stopped
to
kiss
phronsie
who
lifted
a
pale
troubled
face
to
his
do
worry
i
guess
helen
will
be
all
right
and
he
dashed
off
again
now
phronsie
child
said
fisher
come
to
mother
and
let
us
talk
it
over
a
bit
so
phronsie
cuddled
up
in
mamsie
lap
and
laid
her
sad
little
cheek
where
she
had
been
so
often
comforted
mamsie
she
said
at
last
lifting
her
head
i
do
believe
god
will
let
helen
die
because
you
see
she
the
only
child
that
fargo
has
he
could
mamsie
phronsie
darling
god
knows
best
said
fisher
holding
her
close
but
he
would
ever
do
it
i
know
said
phronsie
confidently
going
to
ask
him
not
to
and
tell
him
over
again
about
helen
being
the
very
only
one
that
fargo
has
in
all
the
world
so
she
slipped
to
the
floor
and
went
into
her
own
room
again
and
closed
the
door
dear
jesus
she
said
kneeling
by
her
little
white
bed
please
do
take
helen
away
because
her
mother
has
only
just
helen
and
please
make
dear
papa
give
her
the
right
things
so
that
she
will
live
at
home
and
not
go
to
heaven
yet
amen
then
she
clambered
into
bed
and
lay
looking
out
across
the
moonlight
where
the
light
from
helen
fargo
room
twinkled
through
the
on
the
lawn
chapter
vii
phronsie
i
ca
tell
her
groaned
pepper
the
next
morning
at
sight
of
phronsie
peaceful
little
face
i
never
can
say
the
word
in
all
this
world
phronsie
laughed
and
played
with
baby
quite
merrily
all
such
time
as
miss
carruth
the
governess
allowed
her
from
the
schoolroom
that
morning
everything
is
beautiful
king
dear
she
would
say
on
such
little
flying
visits
to
the
nursery
grandpapa
and
polly
i
do
think
will
be
home
pretty
soon
and
helen
is
going
to
get
well
because
you
know
i
asked
god
to
let
her
and
he
would
ever
in
all
this
world
take
her
away
from
her
mother
he
would
king
she
added
confidentially
in
baby
small
ear
all
day
long
the
turreted
fargo
mansion
gleamed
brightly
in
the
glancing
sunlight
giving
no
hint
of
the
battle
for
a
life
going
on
within
fisher
knew
when
her
husband
sent
for
the
most
celebrated
doctor
for
throat
diseases
knew
when
he
came
and
knew
also
when
each
hour
those
who
were
fighting
the
foe
were
driven
back
baffled
and
several
times
she
attempted
to
tell
phronsie
something
of
the
shadow
hanging
over
the
little
playmate
home
but
phronsie
invariably
put
aside
all
her
attempts
with
a
gentle
persistence
always
saying
he
would
you
know
mamsie
and
at
nightfall
helen
had
gone
and
two
white
little
hands
were
folded
quietly
across
a
young
girl
breast
no
one
told
phronsie
that
night
no
one
could
and
she
clambered
into
her
little
white
bed
after
saying
her
old
prayer
then
she
lay
in
the
moonlight
again
watching
helen
house
the
light
is
out
mamsie
she
called
in
helen
room
but
i
suppose
she
is
asleep
and
presently
fisher
stealing
in
with
unshed
tears
in
her
eyes
found
her
own
child
safe
folded
in
restful
slumber
her
hand
tucked
under
her
cheek
but
the
next
morning
when
she
must
hear
it
phronsie
said
fisher
come
here
dear
it
was
after
breakfast
and
phronsie
was
running
up
into
the
do
you
mean
i
am
not
to
go
to
miss
carruth
asked
phronsie
wonderingly
and
fingering
her
books
yes
dear
oh
phronsie
fisher
abruptly
dropped
her
customary
and
held
out
her
arms
come
here
mother
baby
something
bad
to
tell
you
and
you
must
help
me
dear
phronsie
came
at
once
with
astonished
brown
eyes
and
climbed
up
into
the
good
lap
obediently
phronsie
said
fisher
swallowing
the
lump
in
her
throat
and
looking
at
the
child
fixedly
you
know
helen
has
been
very
sick
yes
mamma
said
phronsie
still
in
a
wonder
well
and
she
suffered
dear
oh
so
much
a
look
of
pain
stole
over
phronsie
face
and
fisher
hastened
to
say
but
oh
phronsie
she
ca
ever
suffer
any
more
for
for
god
has
taken
her
home
phronsie
has
helen
died
asked
phronsie
in
a
sharp
little
voice
so
unlike
her
own
that
pepper
shivered
and
held
her
close
oh
darling
how
can
i
tell
you
yes
dear
god
has
taken
her
home
to
heaven
and
left
fargo
without
any
little
girl
asked
phronsie
in
the
same
tone
my
dear
yes
he
knows
what
is
best
said
poor
fisher
the
startled
look
on
phronsie
little
face
gave
way
to
a
grieved
expression
that
slowly
settled
on
each
feature
let
me
get
down
mamsie
she
said
quietly
and
gently
struggling
to
free
herself
oh
phronsie
what
are
you
going
to
do
cried
fisher
do
sit
with
mother
i
must
think
it
out
mamsie
said
phronsie
with
grave
decision
getting
on
her
feet
and
she
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
and
into
her
own
room
then
closed
the
door
and
all
that
day
she
said
nothing
even
when
mother
fisher
begged
her
to
come
and
talk
it
over
with
her
phronsie
would
say
i
ca
mamsie
dear
it
wo
talk
itself
but
she
was
gentle
and
sweet
with
baby
and
never
relaxed
any
effort
for
his
amusement
and
at
last
when
they
were
folding
helen
away
lovingly
in
flowers
from
all
who
had
loved
her
fisher
wrote
in
despair
to
polly
telling
her
all
about
it
and
adding
you
must
come
home
if
only
for
a
few
days
or
phronsie
will
be
sick
i
shall
go
too
declared
old

blessed
child

i
can
come
back
here
with

nothing
for
it
but
to
help

and
charlotte
father
being
ever
so
much
better
she
joined
them
and
as
soon
as
it
was
a
possible
thing
there
they
were
at
home
and
thomas
was
driving
them
up
at
his
best
speed
to
the
carriage
porch
polly
phronsie
gasped
the
word
and
threw
hungry
little
arms
around

neck
there

polly
cheerily

where
my

in

cheeks

the
old
gentleman
putting
up
his
hand
at
the
shower
well
that

king
so

phronsie
snuggled
close
to
his
side
while
she
clung
to
his
hand
without
a
word
well
we
must
forget
charlotte
cried
polly
darting
back
to
a
tall
girl
with
light
hair
and
very
pale
blue
eyes
standing
composedly
in
one
corner
of
the
hall
and
watching
the
whole
thing
closely
mamsie
dear
here
she
is
taking
her
hand
to
draw
her
to
fisher
do
mind
me
said
charlotte
perfectly
at
her
ease
you
take
care
of
the
little
girl
as
polly
dragged
her
on
fisher
took
a
good
long
look
at
charlotte
chatterton
then
she
smiled

glad
to
see
you
charlotte
illustration
charlotte
standing
composedly
in
one
corner
of
the
hall
charlotte
took
the
firm
fingers
extended
to
her
and
said
thank
you
then
turned
off
to
look
at
phronsie
again
and
it
was
till
after
dinner
that
phronsie
trouble
was
touched
upon
then
polly
drew
her
off
to
a
quiet
corner
now
then
phronsie
she
said
gathering
her
up
close
in
her
arms
tell
me
all
about
it
pet
just
think
and
polly
set
warm
kisses
on
the
pale
little
cheek
how
long
it
is
since
you
and
i
have
had
a
good
talk
i
know
it
said
phronsie
wearily
and
she
drew
a
long
sigh
is
it
good
that
dear
aunty
is
so
much
better
cried
polly
cheerily
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
yes
polly
said
phronsie
but
she
sighed
again
and
did
not
lift
her
eyes
to
polly
face
if
anything
troubles
you
at
last
broke
out
polly
desperately
feel
better
phronsie
to
tell
sister
about
it
i
may
not
know
how
to
say
the
right
things
but
i
can
maybe
help
a
little
phronsie
sat
quite
still
and
folded
and
unfolded
her
hands
in
her
lap
why
did
god
take
away
helen
she
asked
suddenly
lifting
her
head
oh
polly
it
was
nice
of
him
she
added
a
strange
look
coming
into
her
brown
eyes
illustration
phronsie
went
over
to
the
window
oh
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
quite
shocked
do
dear
that
like
you
pet
why
god
made
us
all
and
he
can
do
just
as
he
likes
darling
but
it
is
nice
repeated
phronsie
deliberately
and
quite
firmly
to
take
helen
now
why
does
he
make
another
little
girl
then
for
mrs
fargo
and
she
held
polly
with
her
troubled
eyes
phronsie
cried
polly
then
she
stopped
abruptly
oh
what
can
i
say
i
do
know
dearie
it
just
this
way
we
do
know
why
god
does
things
but
we
love
him
and
we
feel
it
right
oh
phronsie
look
so
there
there
and
she
drew
her
close
to
her
in
a
loving
hungry
clasp
i
told
you
i
did
think
i
could
say
the
right
things
to
you
she
went
on
hurriedly
but
phronsie
i
know
god
did
just
right
in
taking
helen
to
heaven
just
think
how
beautiful
it
must
be
there
and
so
many
little
children
are
there
and
helen
is
so
happy
oh
phronsie
when
i
think
of
that
i
am
glad
she
is
gone
helen
was
happy
here
said
phronsie
decidedly
and
she
never
never
would
want
to
leave
her
mother
alone
to
go
off
to
a
nicer
place
never
polly
polly
drew
a
long
breath
and
shut
her
lips
but
phronsie
do
you
see
she
cried
presently
it
may
be
that
fargo
would
ever
want
to
go
to
heaven
unless
helen
was
there
to
meet
her
it
may
be
phronsie
and
that
would
be
very
dreadful
you
know
and
god
loved
fargo
so
that
he
took
helen
and
he
is
going
to
keep
her
happy
every
single
minute
while
she
is
waiting
and
getting
ready
for
her
mother
phronsie
suddenly
slipped
down
from
polly
lap
is
that
true
she
demanded
yes
dear
said
polly
i
think
it
is
phronsie
and
her
cheeks
glowed
oh
ca
you
see
how
much
nicer
it
is
in
god
to
make
fargo
happy
for
always
with
helen
instead
of
just
a
little
bit
of
a
while
down
here
phronsie
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
up
at
the
winter
sky
it
is
a
long
way
off
she
said
but
the
bitter
tone
had
gone
and
it
was
a
grieved
little
voice
that
added
and
fargo
ca
see
helen
phronsie
said
polly
hurrying
over
to
her
side
perhaps
god
wants
you
to
do
some
things
for
fargo
things
i
mean
that
helen
would
have
done
why
i
ca
go
over
there
said
phronsie
wonderingly
papa
fisher
says
i
am
not
to
go
over
there
for
ever
and
ever
so
long
polly
well
you
can
write
her
little
notes
and
you
can
help
her
to
see
that
god
did
just
right
in
taking
helen
away
said
polly
and
that
would
be
the
very
best
thing
you
could
do
phronsie
for
fargo
the
very
loveliest
thing
in
all
this
world
would
it
asked
phronsie
yes
dear
then
i
do
it
and
perhaps
god
wants
me
to
like
heaven
better
does
he
polly
do
you
think
i
really
and
truly
do
phronsie
said
polly
softly
then
she
leaned
over
and
threw
both
arms
around
phronsie
neck
oh
phronsie
you
see
i
never
thought
of
it
till
now
but
he
has
given
you
somebody
else
instead
of
helen
to
love
and
to
do
things
for
phronsie
looked
up
wonderingly
i
do
know
what
you
mean
polly
she
said
there
charlotte
cried
polly
going
on
rapidly
as
she
released
phronsie
oh
phronsie
you
ca
think
it
been
dreadfully
hard
and
dull
always
for
her
at
home
with
those
two
stiff
pecking
at
her
tell
me
about
it
begged
phronsie
turning
away
from
the
window
and
putting
her
hand
in
polly
well
come
over
to
our
corner
then
so
the
two
ran
back
phronsie
climbing
into
polly
lap
while
a
look
of
contentment
began
to
spread
over
her
face
you
see
began
polly
charlotte
mother
has
always
been
too
ill
to
have
nice
times
she
could
go
out
you
know
very
much
nor
keep
the
house
and
so
the
two
came
to
live
with
them
well
pretty
soon
they
began
to
feel
as
if
they
owned
the
house
and
charlotte
and
everybody
in
it
oh
dear
exclaimed
phronsie
in
distress
and
charlotte
father
alexander
chatterton
could
stop
it
and
beside
he
was
away
on
business
most
of
the
time
and
charlotte
complain
oh
she
behaved
very
nice
about
it
phronsie
her
father
told
grandpapa
all
about
it
and
by
and
by
her
mother
died
and
then
things
got
worse
and
worse
but
chatterton
never
knew
half
how
bad
it
was
but
when
he
was
sick
it
all
came
out
and
it
worried
him
so
that
he
got
very
bad
indeed
and
then
he
sent
for
grandpapa
charlotte
could
stop
him
he
made
her
go
you
see
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
die
and
he
could
bear
to
have
things
so
very
dreadful
for
charlotte
and
is
he
going
to
die
broke
in
phronsie
excitedly
oh
no
indeed
he
was
almost
well
when
we
came
away
it
was
only
his
worrying
over
charlotte
that
made
him
so
bad
oh
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
phronsie
when
grandpapa
offered
to
take
charlotte
home
with
us
for
the
winter
he
was
so
happy
he
almost
cried
i
am
so
glad
he
was
happy
cried
phronsie
in
great
satisfaction
her
cheeks
flushing
and
so
now
i
think
god
gave
charlotte
to
you
for
a
little
while
because
you
have
helen
i
do
phronsie
and
you
can
make
charlotte
glad
while
she
is
here
and
help

polly
merrily
waving

sitting
down
on

stair
she
tore
the
letter
open
alexia
worked
her
way
along
till
she
was
able
to
sit
down
beside
her
when
she
was
guilty
of
looking
over
her
shoulder
oh

one
of
the
other
girls
wishing

ear
and
coolly
read
on

around

suddenly
screamed
and
jumping
up
nearly

in

to
the

rushing
in
tumultuously
well

your
den
looking
around
the
small
room
in
surprise
yes

exclaimed
jasper
joyfully
leaping
from
his
chair
to
seize
pickering
hand
well
what
brought
you
there
nothing
wrong
he
asked
anxiously
scanning
pickering
face
no
that
is
everything
right
all
except

there
is
anything
the
matter
with
polly
jasper
turned
quite
white
scarcely
speaking
the
words
no
she
all
right
only
pickering
turned
impatiently
off
from
the
chair
jasper
pulled
forward
with
a
hasty
hand
and
stalked
to
the
other
side
of
the
little
room
she
she
well
she
so
hard
to
come
at
nowadays
everybody
has
a
chance
for
a
word
with
her
but
old
friends
and
now
the
recital
is
in
full
blast
jasper
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
get
his
color
again
oh
yes
well
it
all
going
on
well
the
recital
i
mean
is
it
he
asked

said
pickering
in
a
gloomy
way
the
girls
are
wild
over
it
you
ca
hear
anything
else
talked
about
at
home
but
he
broke
off
abruptly
got
a
cigar
jasper
and
he
began
to
hunt
the
mantel
among
the
few
spread
around
to
enliven
the
hotel
apartment
have
such
an
article
said
jasper
i
forgot
you

said
pickering
with
a
sigh
dear
me
how
will
you
bear
trouble
when
it
comes
old
chap
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
dismally
at
jasper
i
afraid
a
cigar
would
help
me
much
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
but
if
you
must
have
one
i
can
get
it
eh
yes
i
must
said
pickering
in
despair
for
i
something
on
my
mind
came
over
on
purpose
to
get
your
help
and
i
ca
do
it
without
a
weed
very
well
said
jasper
shoving
the
chair
again
toward
pickering
sit
down
and
i
have
one
sent
up
and
he
went
over
and
touched
the
electric
button
on
the
wall
yes
sir
buttons
ran
his
head
in
the
doorway
and
stared
at
them
without
winking
a
cigar
for
this
gentleman
said
jasper
filliping
a
coin
into
the
boy
hand
is
that
the
way
you
order
cigars
demanded
pickering
whirling
around
in
his
chair
yes
when
i
order
them
at
all
said
jasper
laughing
a
weed
is
a
weed
i
suppose
indeed
and
it
is
not
then
retorted
pickering
i
have
none
of
your
ordering
you
need
bring
it
up
boy
i
go
down
to
the
office
and
pick

said
buttons
putting
down
the
coin
on
the
table
with
a
lingering
finger
keep
it
said
jasper
with
a
smile
he
a
gentleman
observed
buttons
on
the
way
downstairs
pickering
treading
his
heels
he
ai
like
the
rest
of
that
boards
here
they
orders
me
around
with
a
you
or
a
there
boy
they
gents
he
the
whole
word
a
gentleman
king
is
he
repeated
now
then
for
it
said
jasper
when
at
last
the
gleam
of
cigar
was
steady
and
bright
open
your
budget
of
news
old
fellow
he
added
with
difficulty
restraining
his
impatience
it
ought
not
to
be
any
news
declared
pickering
with
extreme
abruptness
for
i
never
tried
to
conceal
it
i
love
polly
jasper
started
so
suddenly
his
arm
knocked
from
the
table
a
slender
crystal
vase
that
broke
into
a
dozen
pieces
never
mind
he
said
at
pickering
dismayed
exclamation
go
on
whew
puff
floated
the
rings
of
cigar
smoke
over
pickering
head
and
i
ca
stand
it
and
i
wo
waiting
any
longer
to
tell
her
so
why
man
he
turned
savagely
now
on
jasper
i
loved
her
for
years
and
must
i
be
bullied
and
badgered
out
of
my
rights
by
men
who
have
only
just
been
introduced
to
her
say
whom
do
you
mean
asked
jasper
huskily
his
fingers
working
over
the
under
the
pretense
of
pulling
the
creases
straight
why
that
loughead
chap
said
pickering
bringing
his
hand
down
heavily
on
the
table
he
has
more
sweet
words
from
polly
pepper
in
a
week
than
i
get
in
a
month
and
i
such
an
old
friend
polly
is
so
anxious
to
help
his
sister
jasper
made
out
to
say
well
that
no
reason
why
the
fellow
should
hang
around
forever
declared
pickering
angrily
why
he
gone
abroad
exclaimed
jasper
long
ago
ah
but
he
coming
back
said
pickering
with
a
sage
nod
and
knocking
off
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
end
is
that
so
cried
jasper
in
astonishment
yes
is
declared
pickering
nodding
again
and
i
do
like
it
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
squaring
around
on
jasper
that
he
care
a
rap
about
his
sister
getting
on
he
only
thinking
of
polly
and
love
her
seeing
that
something
was
expected
of
him
jasper
made
out
to
say
you
do
of
course
i
do
and
you
know
it
and
every
one
knows
it
or
ought
to
i
have
ever
tried
to
conceal
it
said
pickering
proudly
how
do
you
know
that
loughead
is
coming
back
asked
jasper
abruptly
how
do
i
know
the
best
way
in
the
world
pickering
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
hibbard
crane
had
a
letter
yesterday
that
the
reason
i
threw
my
traps
together
and
started
for
you
for
me
cried
jasper
in
surprise
yes

to
help
me
i
ca
stand
it
waiting
around
any
longer
it
has
almost
killed
me
as
it
is
pickering
threw
his
head
on
the
and
took
savage
pulls
at
the
cigar
between
his
teeth
i
help
you
cried
jasper
too
astonished
to
do
much
more
than
to
repeat
the
words
how
in
all
this
world
can
i
do
anything
in
the
matter
he
demanded
as
soon
as
he
could
find
his
voice
why
you
can
tell
polly
how
it
is
you
her
brother
or
as
good
as
one
and
she
see
it
from
you
and
you
must
hurry
about
it
too
for
i
expect
that
loughead
will
turn
up
soon
he
means
mischief
he
does
see
here
pick
cried
jasper
getting
out
of
his
chair
hastily
to
face
pickering
you
do
know
what
you
are
asking
why
i
could
do
it
the
very
idea
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
you
you
must
speak
to
polly
yourself
i
ca
said
pickering
in
a
burst
and
bringing
up
his
head
suddenly
she
wo
give
me
the
ghost
of
a
chance
there
always
those
girls
around
her
and
she
been
away
an
age
at
whitney
and
everlastingly
somebody
is
sick
or
getting
hurt
and
they
wo
have
anybody
but
polly
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
jasper
and
he
turned
on
him
an
injured
countenance
well
do
come
to
me
cried
jasper
beginning
to
pace
the
floor
irritably
i
could
ever
speak
on
such
a
subject
to
polly
beside
it
would
be
the
very
way
to
set
her
against
you
it
would
any
girl
you
see
it
pick
he
added
brightening
up
girls
are
queer
observed
pickering
shrewdly
and
the
very
thing
you
think
they
wo
like
they
take
to
amazingly
oh
you
go
along
jasper
and
let
her
see
how
matters
stand
how
i
feel
i
mean
you
will
do
your
own
speaking
said
jasper
in
his
most
crusty
fashion
and
without
turning
his
head
i
did
that
is
i
tried
to
last
night
after
i
met
crane
began
pickering
in
a
shamefaced
way
but
i
could
get
even
a
chance
to
see
polly
how
that
asked
jasper
still
marching
up
and
down
the
floor
was
she
home
why
she
sent
charlotte
chatterton
down
to
see
me
said
pickering
very
much
aggrieved
and
i
hate
that
chatterton
girl
why
could
polly
see
you
went
on
jasper
determined
since
his
assistance
was
asked
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
oh
somebody
in
the
establishment
i
do
know
who
had
a
i
suppose
said
pickering
carelessly
throwing
away
his
cigar
end
and
lighting
a
fresh
one
and
wanted
polly
never
mind
why
she
come
down
she
sent
word

i
gave
up
in
despair

jasper
with
rising
irritation

wo
i
ca

dear
fellow
well
there
a
great
end
of
our
friendship
exclaimed
pickering
red
with
anger
and
he
jumped
to
his
feet
do
you
mean
to
say
jasper
king
that
you
wo
do
such
a
simple
thing
for
me
as
to
say
a
word
to
your
sister
polly
when
i
tell
you
it
all
up
with
me
if
you
do
speak
that
word
say
you
ought
to
ask
such
a
thing
it
despicable
in
you
cried
jasper
aghast
to
find
his
anger
rising
at
each
word
and
if
you
insist
in
making
such
a
request
when
i
tell
you
that
i
can
not
speak
to
polly
for
you
why
i
shall
be
forced
to
repeat
what
i
said
at
first
that
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
do
you
mean
it
pickering
put
himself
in
front
of
jasper
advancing
strides
that

not
speak
to
polly
for
me
i
do

tell

declared
pickering
now
quite
beside
himself
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
have
your
word
with
her
jasper
king
and
i
tell
you
i
ca
give
that
word
said
jasper
then
he
stopped
short
and
looked
into
pickering
face
i
sorry
old
chap
and
he
put
out
his
hand
pickering
knocked
it
aside
in
a
towering
passion
you
need
chap
me
he
cried
and
there
an
end
to
our
friendship
king
he
seized
his
hat
and
dashed
out
of
the
room
miss
salisbury
alexia
rhys
in
real
distress
threw
herself
against
her
old
teacher
who
was
hurrying
through
the
long
well
what
is
it
asked
miss
salisbury
settling
her
glasses
for
a
look
at
her
former
pupil
you
must
hinder
me
i
on
my
way
to
the
recitation
room
and
her
hand
made
a
movement
toward
her
watch
oh
do
think
of
time
miss
salisbury
begged
alexia
just
as
familiarly
as
in
the
old
days
when
polly
pepper
needs
to
be
looked
out
for
if
polly
pepper
needs
me
in
any
way
why
i
must
stop
said
the
principal
of
the
young
ladies
select
boarding
and
day
school
but
i
do
see
how
she
can
need
me
alexia
she
added
in
perplexity
polly
is
fully
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
oh
no
she
is
cried
alexia
abruptly
beg
your
pardon
but
polly
is
a
dear
sweet
dreadful
idiot
oh
dear
me
what
do
you
suppose
miss
salisbury
she
has
gone
and
done
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
guess
said
miss
salisbury
calmly
and
i
must
say
alexia
i
am
very
much
pained
by
your
failure
to
profit
by
my
instructions
to
think
that
one
of
my
young
ladies
especially
one
on
whom
i
have
spent
so
much
care
and
attention
as
yourself
should
be
so
careless
in
speech
and
manner
as
you
are
constantly
and
done
oh
alexia
she
exclaimed
in
a
grieved
way
oh
i
know
cried
alexia
imperturbably
you
did
your
best
dear
miss
salisbury
and
it
is
your
fault
that
i
not
fine
but
oh
waste
the
time
please
over
me
when
i
want
to
tell
you
about
polly
what
is
it
about
polly
demanded
miss
salisbury
fingering
her
nervously
really
alexia
i
think
polly
would
do
very
well
if
you
did
try
so
hard
to
take
possession
of
her
i
quite
pity
her
she
added
frankly
alexia
burst
into
a
laugh
it
the
only
way
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
miss
salisbury
she
cried
for
everybody
is
trying
to
take
possession
of
polly
pepper
and
now
oh
it
getting
perfectly
dreadful
miss
salisbury
took
an
impatient
step
forward
oh
miss
salisbury
cried
alexia
in
alarm
wait
just
a
minute
do
dear
miss
salisbury
she
cried
throwing
her
arms
around
her
thereby
endangering
the
glasses
set
upon
the
fine
roman
nose
there
ca
any
one
help
in
this
but
just
you
it
is
very
wrong
said
miss
salisbury
yet
yielding
to
the
embrace
for
me
to
stay
and
listen
to
you
in
this
way
but
but
i
always
been
fond
of
you
alexia
and
i
know
it
cried
alexia
penitently
you
just
been
a
dear
always
miss
salisbury
to
me
if
you
had
why
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
for
i
had
nobody
but
aunt
with
a
little
pathetic
sniff
to
look
after
me
my
dear
alexia
cried
miss
salisbury
quite
softened
do
feel
so
you
are
very
dear
to
me
you
always
were
patting
her
hand
and
so
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
tell
me
now
pray
be
quick
dear
well
then
will
you
promise
to
make
polly
pepper
do
what
she
ought
to
miss
salisbury
cried
alexia
quite
enchanted
with
her
success
thus
far
miss
salisbury
turned
a
puzzled
face
at
her
will
i
make
polly
pepper
do
as
she
ought
to
she
repeated
my
dear
alexia
what
a
strange
request
polly
pepper
is
always
doing
as
she
ought
well
polly
is
just
hateful
to
herself
declared
alexia
and
if
it
was
for
us
girls
she
oh
dear
me
i
do
know
what
would
happen
what
do
you
suppose
miss
salisbury
she
gone
and
oh
dear
i
mean
to
but
what
do
you
suppose
polly
has
just
done
illustration
my
dear
alexia
cried
miss
salisbury
quite
softened
do
feel
so
before
miss
salisbury
could
reply
alexia
rushed
on
frantically
if
you
believe
me
polly
has
gone
and
asked
that
charlotte
chatterton
to
sing
at
her
recital
just
think
of
that
exclaimed
alexia
quite
gone
at
the
enormity
of
such
a
blunder
why
does
charlotte
chatterton
sing
well
asked
miss
salisbury
in
surprise
oh
frightfully
well
said
alexia
that
just
the
trouble
and
now
polly
recital
will
all
be
part
of
that
chatterton
girl
glory
and
it
was
to
be
so
swell
and
alexia
sank
into
a
chair
and
waved
back
and
forth
in
grief
swell
oh
alexia
exclaimed
miss
salisbury
in
consternation
oh
do
excuse
me
mumbled
alexia
but
polly
really
has
spoiled
that
elegant
recital
it
wo
be
all
polly
now
oh
dear
me
miss
salisbury
drew
a
long
breath
i
very
glad
polly
has
asked
miss
chatterton
to
sing
she
said
at
last
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
very
glad
that
polly
has
asked
that
chatterton
girl
to
sing
almost
shrieked
alexia
starting
out
of
her
chair
yes
said
miss
salisbury
decidedly
very
glad
indeed
alexia
and
now
you
wo
make
polly
see
that
charlotte
chatterton
ought
not
to
be
stuck
into
that
recital
cried
alexia
wildly
oh
dear
me
and
you
are
the
only
one
that
can
bring
polly
to
her
senses
oh
dear
me
certainly
not
said
miss
salisbury
with
a
little
dignified
laugh
the
recital
is
polly
and
she
knows
best
how
to
manage
it
well
we
wo
applaud
we
girls
wo
declared
alexia
stiffening
up
when
that
charlotte
chatterton
sings
but
we
all
just
look
the
other
way
every
single
one
of
us
alexia
rhys
slowly
ejaculated
miss
salisbury
in
real
sorrow
well
we
ca
it
would
be
right
gasped
alexia
do
look
so
miss
salisbury
oh
dear
me
why
will
polly
act
so
oh
dear
me
i
wish
charlotte
chatterton
was
in
the
red
sea
miss
salisbury
gathered
herself
up
in
quiet
disapproval
and
with
a
parting
look
prepared
to
leave
the
room
oh
miss
salisbury
cried
alexia
flying
after
her
to
pluck
her
gown
do
turn
around
oh
dear
me
and
she
began
to
cry
as
hard
as
she
could
when
you
have
come
to
your
better
self
alexia
i
will
talk
with
you
said
miss
salisbury
distinctly
and
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
did
she
say
she
would
did
she
did
she
cried
a
group
of
the
old
girls
as
miss
salisbury
present
scholars
called
polly
and
her
set
as
they
came
tiptoeing
in
why
where
are
you
alexia
here
said
a
dismal
voice
from
the
depths
of
a
corner
easy
chair
they
all
rushed
at
her
i
had
an
awful
time
with
her
sobbed
alexia
her
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
and
i
suppose
it
really
will
kill
me
girls
nonsense
cried
one
or
two
well
what
did
she
say
about
making
polly
listen
to
reason
oh
dreadful
dreadful
groaned
alexia
gustily
you
ca
think
you
do
mean
to
say
that
she
approves
after
all
that
polly
pepper
has
worked
over
that
old
recital
to
have
some
one
else
come
in
and
grab
the
glory
finished
another
voice
oh
dear
dear
groaned
alexia
in
between
and
miss
salisbury
would
kill
you
clem
if
she
heard
you
say
well
do
tell
us
what
did
miss
salisbury
say
demanded
another
girl
impatiently
she
said
it
was
right
for
polly
to
ask
charlotte
chatterton
to
sing
and
she
was
glad
she
was
going
to
do
it
oh
horrors
exclaimed
the
group
in
dismal
chorus
the
idea
as
much
as
she
loves
polly
pepper
cried
sally
moore
and
i
hate
the
word
exploded
alexia
whirling
her
handkerchief
around
her
fingers
now
it
poked
at
one
everlastingly
i
think
it
just
sweet
to
be
wicked
oh
alexia
rhys
well
just
a
little
bit
wicked
said
alexia
cathie
harrison
shook
back
the
waves
of
light
hair
on
her
brow
girls
she
began
hesitatingly
but
no
one
would
listen
the
laments
were
going
on
so
fast
over
polly
and
her
doings
it
right
cried
cathie
at
last
after
many
ineffectual
attempt
to
be
heard
do
stop
girls
making
such
a
noise
she
added
impatiently
that
a
great
way
to
preach
said
clem
laughing
lose
your
temper
to
begin
with
cathie
i
did
that
is
i
sorry
said
cathie
but
anyway
i
want
to
say
i
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
to
act
so
about
that
chatterton
girl
where
should
i
have
been
if
polly
pepper
had
taken
me
up
she
looked
down
the
long
aisle
to
a
seat
in
the
corner
there
where
i
sat
pointing
to
it
and
you
all
know
it
for
a
whole
week
and
i
thought
i
should
die
i
did
tragically
without
any
one
speaking
to
me
and
one
day
polly
pepper
came
up
and
asked
would
i
come
to
her
house
to
the
bee
you
were
all
going
to
get
up
to
fit
out
that
horrible
old
poor
white
family
down
south
and
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
scream
i
was
so
glad
cathie
harrison
exclaimed
alexia
springing
to
her
feet
defiantly
what
do
you
want
to
bring
back
those
dreadful
old
times
for
you
are
the
most
uncomfortable
person
i
ever
saw
you
need
mind
it
now
alexia
cried
cathie
rushing
at
her
for
you
been
too
lovely
for
anything
ever
since
you
dear
i
lovely
oh
girls
did
you
hear
cried
alexia
sinking
into
her
chair
again
quite
overcome
she
said
i
was
lovely
oh
dear
me
and
so
you
are
repeated
cathie
stoutly
just
as
nice
and
sweet
and
lovely
to
me
as
you
can
be
so
throwing
her
long
arms
around
alexia
i
did
want
to
be
polly
made
me
said
alexia
i
know
it
but
i
do
care
you
are
nice
now
any
way
and
i
suppose
we
must
be
nice
to
that
chatterton
girl
now
if
she
does
break
up
our
fun
said
alexia
with
a
sigh
getting
out
of
her
chair
come
on
girls
let
us
go
and
tell
polly
it
just
heavenly
that
charlotte
is
to
sing
chapter
ix
polly
recital
charlotte
chatterton
stood
back
of
the
portiere
pulling
a
refractory
button
of
her
glove
into
place
as
a
gay
group
precipitated
themselves
into
the
of
the
exeter
now
remember
girls
cried
alexia
rushing
at
the
toilet
table
to
bestow
frantic
twitches
at
the
fluffy
waves
of
hair
over
her
forehead
that
we
must
applaud
the
very
minute
that
she
gets
through
singing
oh
dear
me
just
look
at
my
bangs
they
are
perfect
frights
hateful
things
with
another
pull
at
the
offending
locks
it
a
swell
house
exclaimed
one
of
the
girls
delightedly
just
let
miss
salisbury
catch
you
saying
warned
alexia
take
care
now
sally
moore
this
is
a
very
proper
and
select
occasion
well
do
let
some
of
us
have
that
glass
a
minute
retorted
sally
and
mend
your
manners
before
you
take
occasion
to
correct
my
speech
my
bangs
are
worse
than
yours
sally
cried
another
girl
crowding
up
do
let
me
get
one
corner
of
that
glass
trying
to
achieve
a
view
of
her
head
over
alexia
shoulder
alexia
calmly
picked
at
the
fluffy
bunch
of
hair
on
her
brow
giving
it
a
little
quirk
before
she
said
do
fight
girls
it
quite
spoils
one
looks
i
never
do
when
i
dressed
up
of
course
not
said
sally
moore
for
you
get
everything
you
want
without
fighting
the
idea
exclaimed
alexia
with
an
injured
expression
when
i
never
have
my
own
way
why
i
give
up
and
give
up
the
whole
time
to
somebody
well
never
mind
let
talk
about
the
recital
oh
it
going
to
be
quite
elegant
for
polly
pepper
there
a
regular
society
cram
in
the
hall
well
i
do
think
cram
is
a
bit
better
than
a
affair
said
clem
forsythe
slipping
out
of
her
opera
cloak
nor
i
either
cried
three
or
four
voices
oh
i
do
object
to
affair
myself
said
alexia
i
have
used
the
words
on
more
than
one
occasion
unless
my
memory
is
treacherous
i
only
wanted
to
spare
miss
salisbury
nerves
pity
you
did
give
more
attention
to
miss
salisbury
nerves
five
or
six
years
ago
said
sally
do
get
away
from
that
glass
it
no
time
to
talk
about
me
now
observed
alexia
all
our
minds
should
be
on
polly
and
her
recital
girls
you
see
jack
loughead
down
at
the
door
did
we
cried
the
girls
he
as
handsome
as
a
picture
is
he
cried
alexia
with
another
little
pull
at
her
rebellious
hair
is
he
hummed
the
girls
well
he
wo
look
at
you
for
all
your
fussing
over
those
bangs
said
sally
vindictively
did
you
suppose
i
thought
he
would
cried
alexia
coolly
why
polly
pepper
everybody
knows
that
brings
him
here
what
become
of
mr
bayley
asked
one
of
the
girls
suddenly
hush
sh
you
must
ask
cried
alexia
mysteriously
and
turning
away
from
the
mirror
with
a
lingering
movement
there
it
looks
shockingly
but
it
is
as
good
as
i
can
fix
it
your
hair
always
does
look
perfectly
horrid
declared
sally
moore
deftly
slipping
into
the
vacated
place
well
do
tell
all
you
know
about
bayley
and
polly
begged
the
girl
who
had
raised
the
question
i
just
dying
to
know
alexia
rhys
does
know
a
thing
more
than
we
do
frances
said
clem
only
she
pretends
she
in
the
secret
i
was
down
at
dunraven
at
the
christmas
splurge
said
alexia
and
you
were
not
clem
that
all
i
shall
say
and
she
leisurely
disposed
herself
in
a
big
chair
and
began
to
draw
on
her
gloves
with
the
air
of
one
who
could
reveal
volumes
were
she
so
disposed
polly
would
ever
send
him
off
said
one
of
the
girls
i
believe
why
he
horribly
rich
and
just
think
of
marrying
into
the
bayley
family
oh
my
i
should
think
the
shock
of
being
asked
to
enter
that
family
would
kill
any
girl
to
begin
with
said
clem
why
he
goes
back
to
william
the
conqueror
does
he
and
there
an
earl
in
the
family
and
i
do
know
what
else
and
then
beside
there
his
mother
the
idea
of
sitting
opposite
to
her
at
the
table
every
single
day
oh
dear
me
i
know
i
should
drop
my
knife
and
fork
and
things
from
pure
fright
i
sure
i
do
see
why
anybody
is
proud
to
have
his
family
go
back
all
the
time
said
alexia
rhys
for
my
part
i
should
want
to
start
things
forward
a
little
myself
well
who
does
know
anything
about
it
why
bayley
has
gone
off
suddenly
demanded
frances
no
one
knows
said
clem
alexia
hummed
a
tune
provokingly
we
all
guess
and
it
easy
enough
to
guess
the
truth
but
polly
ever
let
it
out
so
that
all
there
is
about
it
well
now
girls
said
alexia
suddenly
we
must
remember
what
we
promised
each
other
what
do
you
mean
asked
frances
i
did
promise
anything
to
anybody
you
were
with
us
when
we
promised
my
dear
answered
alexia
and
i
rise
and
explain
you
see
we
do
any
of
us
like
that
charlotte
chatterton
not
a
single
one
of
us
she
a
perfect
stick
i
think
so
do
i
said
another
girl
this
is
the
way
she
walks
thereupon
followed
a
representation
given
to
the
life
of
charlotte
method
of
getting
her
long
figure
over
the
ground
which
brought
subdued
peals
of
laughter
from
the
girls
looking
on
and
she
has
no
more
feeling
than
an
oyster
pursued
alexia
when
she
had
recovered
her
breath
or
she
might
see
that
polly
was
just
giving
up
all
her
fun
and
ours
too
by
dragging
her
into
everything
that
is
going
on
i
know
it
said
the
girls
and
i
so
sick
of
her
taking
in
everything
so
as
a
matter
of
course
observed
alexia
oh
she
quite
an
old
sponge
it
bad
enough
to
be
called
an
oyster
without
having
old
sponge
fastened
to
one
said
sally
moore
coming
away
from
the
mirror
thereby
occasioning

useful
appointment

other
frances

polly

better
hurry
or
you
will
lose
your
seats
announced
a
friendly
voice
in
the
doorway
which
had
the
effect
to
send
the
whole
bevy
out
as
precipitately
as
they
had
hurried
in
when
she
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
remained
charlotte
chatterton
shook
herself
free
from
the
friendly
and
stepped
to
the
center
of
the
deserted
room
i
not
sing
one
note
she
declared
standing
tall
not
one
single
note
just
then
in
ran
amy
loughead
oh

between

huddling
up
against

you
must
think
of
their
eyes
child
laughed
polly
but
there
was
a
little
white
line
around
her
mouth
just
then
a
messenger
came
in
with
a
note
any
answer
asked
polly
oh

would
better
read
it
before
you

she
tore
it
open
i
am
so
sorry
that

can
not
keep
my
engagement
to

with
miss

but
the

he
says

julia
anderson
illustration
i

the
note
fell
to
polly
lap
and
for
a
minute
she
could
not
speak
there
is
no
answer
at
last
she
said
to
the
messenger
oh
miss
pepper
what

it
cried
amy
loughead
brought
out
of
her
own
fright
by
the
dread
of
a
new
trouble
julia
anderson

sick
and

not
be
here
said
polly
oh

she
was
going

cried
amy
in
consternation
why

her
place
said
polly
forcing
herself
to
speak
oh
dear

exclaimed
amy
trying
not
to
burst
into
tears
everything

just
as
bad
and
horrid
as
it
can
be
oh

amy
said
polly
trying
to
smile
that
you
never
do
she
threw
the
note
on
the
floor
now
and
began
to
rub
the
cold
little
hands
again
but
but
i
so
frightened
gasped
amy
charlotte
chatterton
walked
to
the
window
i
may
be
a
stick
and
an
oyster
and
an
old
sponge
and
everybody
wish
me
out
of
the
way
but
i
not
such
a
villain
as
to
bother
her
now
by
telling
her
i
wo
sing
if
they
only
wo
applaud
she
shut
her
teeth
tightly
and
turned
back
again
i
would
miss
loughead
she
began
but
her
voice
sounded
cold
and
unsympathetic
and
amy
clung
to
polly
tighter
than
ever
ben
now
looked
in
come
polly
he
said
you
really
ought
to
be
out
here
and
it
almost
three
amy
gave
a
gasp
what
shall
i
do
you
may
stay
in
here
if
you
really
wish
said
polly
in
a
low
voice
charlotte
chatterton
looking
on
with
all
her
eyes
and
i
will
excuse
you
and
will
will
you
be
disappointed
in
me
amy
brought
out
the
question
shamefacedly
very
much
said
polly
and
will
you
never
try
me
again
and
never
give
me
music
lessons
asked
amy
fearfully
i
do
not
seem
to
teach
you
successfully
said
polly
very
slowly
so
it
would
be
no
use
to
continue
the
lessons
and
she
put
aside
the
clinging
hands
you
may
stay
here
amy
i
am
coming
ben
looking
over
at
him
i
play
cried
amy
loughead
desperately
i
rather
oh
dear
me
if
they
were
bears
and
gorillas
looking
on
and
i
just
know
i
shall
die
but
i
rather
miss
pepper
than
to
have
you
give
me
up
charlotte
chatterton
drew
a
long
breath
what
the
matter
asked
ben
in
dismay
miss
loughead
was
a
little
scared
i
believe
said
charlotte
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
manner
ben
gave
an
uneasy
exclamation
everything
seems
to
be
all
right
now
he
said
in
a
relieved
way
looking
off
at
polly
and
amy
oh
yes
a
scare
do
amount
to
much
if
one
has
a
mind
to
put
it
down
said
charlotte
i
should
think
you
be
scared
said
ben
looking
at
her
admiringly
to
stand
up
and
sing
before
all
those
people
but
i
suppose
you
never
are
you
do
seem
to
mind
things
like
the
rest
of
us
charlotte
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
said
nothing
we
are
all
ready
said
polly
cheerfully
coming
up
with
amy
oh
charlotte
you
are
such
a
comfort
she
found
time
to
whisper
charlotte
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
so
that
an
ominous
rent
appeared
in
one
of
her
pretty
gloves
i
sing
she
kept
saying
to
herself
all
the
way
out
to
the
platform
oh
i
sing
i
sing
and
later
on
while
looking
down
into
the
eyes
of
the
girls
waiting
to
applaud
i
sing
i
sing
she
had
to
declare
to
herself
till
her
name
was
announced
as
the
last
note
died
away
who
is
that
girl
went
around
the
hall
charlotte
chatterton
had
made
a
sensation
alexia
rhys
angry
at
the
effect
of
the
song
still
clapped
steadily
together
her
hands
looking
at
polly
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
all
the
while
charlotte
oh
i
glad
whispered
polly
radiantly
they
want
you
to
sing
again
trying
to
pull
her
forward
as
the
storm
of
applause
went
on
i
not
sing
cried
charlotte
passionately
never
do
ask
it
polly
why
charlotte
implored
polly
astonished
at
the
passion
in
the
girl
usually
so
cold
and
indifferent
still
the
applause
continued
set
keeping
at
it
like
veterans
ben
ran
up
the
platform
steps
with
shining
eyes
grandpapa
requests
charlotte
to
sing
again
he
whispered
to
polly
there
you
hear
charlotte
said
polly
grandpapa
wishes
it
very
well
said
charlotte
resuming
her
ordinary
manner
and
looking
as
if
it
really
made
no
difference
to
her
whether
she
sang
or
was
quiet
she
walked
to
her
place
polly
slipped
back
of
the
piano
and
began
the
accompaniment
and
again
charlotte
singing
carried
all
by
storm
polly
looking
down
into
jasper
face
saw
him
smile
over
to
his
father
and
nod
in
a
pleased
surprise
and
she
was
aghast
to
feel
a
faint
little
wish
begin
to
grow
in
her
heart
that
charlotte
chatterton
had
not
been
asked
to
sing
of
course
jasper
is
surprised
as
he
has
never
heard
her
sing
said
polly
to
herself
and
her
voice
is
so
beautiful
in
this
big
hall
oh
it
so
very
beautiful
as
charlotte
came
back
apparently
not
hearing
the
expressions
of
delight
that
rang
over
the
that
chatterton
girl
will
be
all
the
rage
now
whispered
alexia
savagely
to
clem
who
sat
next
to
her
look
at
cabot
she
has
her
air
on
and
i
know
she
making
up
her
mind
to
give
charlotte
a
musicale
other
people
also
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
hall
were
making
up
their
minds
to
introduce
miss
chatterton
to
their
friends
as
a
girl
with
such
a
wonderful
voice
it
would
be
quite
worth
one
while
to
bring
out
polly
by
this
time
explaining
to
the
audience
the
failure
of
miss
anderson
to
take
her
part
in
the
duet
caught
little
ends
of
the
whispers
going
on
beneath
her
such
as
perfectly
exquisite
most
wonderful
range
shall
certainly
ask
her
to
sing
and
again
she
saw
jasper
beaming
face
while
ben
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
delight
and
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
mechanically
and
began
in
a
dazed
way
to
help
miss
porter
through
with
the
duet
that
was
to
have
been
one
of
the
finest
things
on
the
carefully
prepared
programme
illustration
for
shame
polly
if
the
little
brown
house
teachings
are
forgotten
like
this
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
slow
movement
polly
glanced
down
and
caught
her
mother
eye
polly
it
said
just
as
plainly
as
if
fisher
had
spoken
is
this
my
girl
for
shame
if
the
little
brown
house
teachings
are
forgotten
like
this
polly
straightened
up
sent
mamsie
down
a
bright
smile
that
made
fisher
nod
and
flash
back
one
in
return
then
bent
all
her
energies
to
making
that
duet
speak
its
message
through
the
people
who
had
rather
languished
in
their
chairs
now
gathered
themselves
up
with
fresh
interest
and
clapped
their
hands
at
the
brilliant
passages
and
exclaimed
over
the
ability
of
the
music
teacher
who
could
change
an
apparent
failure
to
such
a
glorious
success
everybody
said
it
was
wonderful
and
when
the
duet
was
over
the
house
rang
with
the
charming
noise
by
which
the
gratified
friends
tried
to
express
their
delight
but
polly
saw
only
mamsie
eyes
filled
with
joy
meantime
charlotte
chatterton
had
hurried
out
to
the
tossing
on
her
walking
things
with
a
quick
hand
and
held
fast
for
a
minute
as
she
crept
out
into
the
broad
passage
by
the
duet
now
in
full
progress
she
went
softly
down
the
stairs
when
it
was
all
over
everybody
crowded
around
polly
oh
miss
pepper
your
recital
is
lovely
oh
how
beautifully
miss
chatterton
sang
and
oh
miss
pepper
i
am
delighted
with
your
pupils
progress
and
what
an
exquisite
voice
miss
chatterton
has
and
then
it
was
oh
it
must
have
been
so
hard
miss
pepper
for
you
to
excuse
miss
anderson
at
the
last
minute
and
we
ca
thank
you
enough
for
letting
us
hear
miss
chatterton
sing
oh
i
shall
fly
crazy
to
hear
them
go
on
cried
alexia
to
a
little
bunch
of
girls
back
of
the
crowd
will
nothing
stop
them
wringing
her
hands
angrily
together
it
all
chatterton
chatterton
now
and
after
polly
magnificent
playing
too
oh
dear
me
i
knew
it
would
be
so
polly
turned
with
a
happy
face
to
pull
charlotte
forward
to
hear
the
kind
things
why
where
oh
she
gone
home
answered
alexia
stepping
forward
hastily
has
she
girls
appealing
to
them
she
must
have
she
went
out
like
a
shot
do
polly
how
can
you
she
begged
turning
back
to
twitch
polly
arm
you
done
enough
i
should
think
what
did
she
run
off
for
cried
jasper
scaling
the
platform
steps
polly
glanced
quickly
up
into
his
beaming
face
oh
jasper
she
has
gone
home
i
could
help
it
and
her
face
fell
he
looked
annoyed
never
mind
polly
he
said
his
brow
clearing
father
wanted
to
introduce
her
to
some
friends
that
all
well
and
was
it
a
grand
success
though
and
he
beamed
at
her
yes
said
polly
settling
amy
music
with
an
unsteady
hand
and
charlotte
really
surprised
us
all
he
went
on
gaily
why
polly
who
would
think
that
we
have
or
you
rather
for
you
have
done
it
all
the
honor
to
bring
out
a
nightingale
here
let
me
do
that
for
you
he
was
fairly
bubbling
over
with
delight
and
as
he
essayed
to
take
the
music
out
of
polly
hand
he
laughed
again
dear
me
how
stupid
i
am
as
a
piece
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
did
amy
do
nicely
asked
polly
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
tired
now
yes
indeed
assented
jasper
enthusiastically
as
he
recovered
the
piece
just
splendidly
i
did
know
she
had
so
much
music
in
her
oh
here
comes
a
horde
of
congratulations
polly
he
threw
her
the
brightest
of
smiles
as
he
moved
to
make
way
for
a
group
of
friends
hurrying
up
to
shower
polly
with
compliments
and
every
one
had
something
delightful
to
add
of
charlotte
chatterton
singing
jasper
could
help
but
be
happy
over
charlotte
singing
said
polly
to
herself
and
looking
after
him
it
so
beautiful
as
they
came
up
where
are
you
going
polly
called
alexia
at
last
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
janitor
was
closing
the
big
outer
door
as
polly
ran
ahead
of
the
girls
and
down
the
long
steps
of
the
exeter
illustration
polly
turned
and
waved
her
at
them
polly
turned
and
waved
her
at
them
for
a
reply
now
somebody
is
going
to
carry
her
off
grumbled
alexia
hurry
up
girls
let
see
who
it
is
so
they
ran
as
lightly
as
polly
herself
after
her
down
the
steps
only
in
time
to
see
old
king
help
her
into
the
carriage
with
fisher
and
phronsie
and
drive
rapidly
off
whatever
in
the
world
is
the
matter
cried
alexia
running
up
to
jasper
who
was
watching
them
speed
away
why
polly
thinks
charlotte
is
sick
explained
jasper
because
she
went
home
before
the
recital
was
out
stuff
and
nonsense
exclaimed
alexia
angrily
what
is
the
matter
with
polly
jasper
she
grows
worse
and
worse
why
ca
she
let
charlotte
chatterton
alone
pray
tell
i
for
one
should
think
mischief
enough
had
been
done
by
that
girl
you
should
think
mischief
enough
had
been
done
by
charlotte
repeated
jasper
in
astonishment
i
must
say
alexia
that
i
fail
to
understand
you
to
hear
people
praise
to
the
very
skies
that
chatterton
girl
cried
alexia
in
a
passion
she
was
actually
stamping
her
foot
now
oh
oh
why
do
some
of
you
say
something
she
cried
appealing
suddenly
to
the
girls
you
all
feel
as
i
do
about
polly
pushing
forward
that
girl
and
there
you
stand
and
make
me
do
all
the
talking
jasper
looked
grave
at
once
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
one
to
exert
herself
to
talk
over
this
he
said
it
is
polly
affair
and
hers
alone
he
raised
his
hat
to
her
and
to
the
rest
of
the
group
and
walked
off
chapter
phronsie
has
a
plan
phronsie
was
the
first
to
reach
charlotte
door
charlotte
she
called
softly
through
the
keyhole
there
was
no
answer
and
after
one
or
two
ineffectual
attempts
phronsie
turned
fearfully
away
i
do
believe
something
is
in
the
room
with
charlotte
she
said
as
polly
came
running
up
the
stairs
then
she
sat
down
on
the
top
step
and
clasped
her
hands
i
heard
it
raging
up
and
down
oh
no
phronsie
said
polly
reassuringly
there
could
be
anything
in
there
with
charlotte
i
try
and
she
laid
a
quick
hand
on
the
knob
oh
charlotte
do
open
the
door
you
are
worrying
us
all
so
called
polly
imploringly
charlotte
flung
wide
the
door
two
red
spots
burned
on
her
cheeks
and
her
pale
blue
eyes
snapped
but
when
she
saw
polly
she
said
i
sorry
i
frightened
you
but
i
best
alone
is
there
really
anything
in
here
with
you
charlotte
asked
phronsie
getting
off
from
her
stair
to
peer
past
polly
oh
i
sure
i
heard
it
raging
up
and
down
that
was
i
said
charlotte
i
was
the
wild
beast
phronsie
oh
dear
breathed
phronsie
and
oh
exclaimed
polly
charlotte
said
phronsie
coming
in
to
slip
her
hand
into
charlotte
it
was
just
beautiful
when
you
sang
i
thought
it
was
birds
when
you
went
clear
up
into
the
air
i
did
really
charlotte
oh
do
begged
charlotte
looking
over
at
polly
come
down
to
dinner
charlotte
said
polly
quickly
really
you
must

i
am
afraid
grandpapa
will
be
up
here
after
you
i
do

exclaimed
jasper
with
only
a
thought
for
pleasure
when
polly
had
cried
how
nice
of
mrs
cabot
do
you
say
so
father
he
added
assuredly
said
old
king
with
great
satisfaction
in
pleasure
and
at
her
success
in
drawing
charlotte
out
and
then
he
thought
no
more
about
it
and
the
bell
ringing
and
alstyne
coming
in
he
went
off
into
the
library
for
a
quiet
chat
and
after
this
there
were
no
more
quiet
days
for
charlotte
chatterton
everybody
who
was
musical
wanted
to
revel
in
her
voice
and
everybody
who
was
wanted
the
same
thing
because
it
was
so
talked
about
so
she
was
asked
to
sing
at
musicales
and
receptions
without
end
until
alexia
exclaimed
at
last
they
are
all
raving
over
her
and
all
polly
own
fault
the
whole
of
it
phronsie
laid
down
the
note
she
was
writing
to
fargo
a
fortnight
later
and
said
to
herself
i
would
better
do
it
now
i
think
and
going
out
she
went
deliberately
to
old
king
room
and
rapped
at
the
door
come
in
called
the
old
gentleman
come
in
oh
bless
me
it
you
phronsie
in
pleased
surprise
yes
grandpapa
said
phronsie
coming
in
and
shutting
the
door
carefully
i
came
on
purpose
to
see
you
all
alone
so
you
did
dear
said
king
highly
gratified
and
pushing
away
his
writing
table
he
held
out
his
hand
now
then
phronsie
you
are
never
going
to
be
too
big
you
know
to
sit
on
my
knee
so
hop
up
now
oh
no
grandpapa
cried
phronsie
in
a
rapture
i
could
never
be
too
big
for
that
so
she
perched
up
as
of
old
on
his
knee
then
she
folded
her
hands
and
looked
gravely
in
his
face
well
my
dear
what
is
it
asked
the
old
gentleman
presently
come
to
tell
me
something
i
suppose
yes
grandpapa
i
have
said
phronsie
decidedly
and
it
is
most
important
too
grandpapa
and
oh
i
do
wish
it
so
much
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tighter
and
sighed
well
then
phronsie
if
you
want
it
i
suppose
it
must
be
said
king
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
but
first
child
tell
me
what
it
is
and
he
stroked
her
yellow
hair
grandpapa
asked
phronsie
suddenly
how
much
money
did
chatterton
say
i
was
to
have
oh
bless
me
exclaimed
king
with
a
start
why
what
makes
you
ask
such
a
question
oh
she
left
you
everything
she
had
phronsie
a
couple
of
millions
or
so
it
is
why
grandpapa
asked
phronsie
looking
intently
at
him
is
charlotte
very
very
poor
charlotte
poor
repeated
the
old
gentleman
why
no
not
exactly
her
father
is
rich
but
charlotte
i
think
may
do
very
well
especially
as
i
intend
to
keep
her
here
for
a
while
and
then
i
shall
never
let
her
suffer
phronsie
never
indeed
grandpapa
said
phronsie
was
chatterton
aunt
to
charlotte
yes
that
is
to
charlotte
father
corrected
king
but
what
of
that
child
pray
what
have
you
got
into
your
head
phronsie
if
chatterton
was
aunt
to
charlotte
persisted
phronsie
slowly
it
seems
as
if
charlotte
ought
to
have
some
of
the
money
it
really
does
grandpapa
but
cousin
eunice
did
think
so
else
she
have
left
it
to
charlotte
said
king
abruptly
and
she
did
choose
to
leave
it
to
you
so
there
an
end
of
it
phronsie
i
did
want
you
to
have
it
but
the
thing
was
fixed
and
i
could
help
myself
and
neither
can
we
do
anything
now
but
take
matters
as
they
are
i
do
think
said
phronsie
without
taking
her
eyes
from
his
face
that
maybe
chatterton
is
sorry
now
and
wishes
that
she
had
left
some
money
to
charlotte
do
you
suppose
so
grandpapa
and
one
hand
stole
up
to
his
neck
maybe
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
short
laugh
and
i
wonder
if
cousin
eunice
was
sorry
over
a
few
other
things
too
phronsie
would
it
make
her
very
glad
if
i
gave
charlotte
some
of
the
money
phronsie
red
lips
were
very
close
to
his
ear
now
oh
i
do
want
to
so
much
you
ca
think
grandpapa
how
much
for
answer
king
set
her
down
hastily
on
the
floor
and
took
two
or
three
turns
up
and
down
the
room
phronsie
stood
a
moment
quite
still
where
he
left
her
then
she
ran
up
to
him
and
slipped
her
hand
within
his
oh
i
do
so
wish
i
might
she
said
there
so
much
for
a
little
girl
like
me
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
charlotte
have
some
with
me
still
no
answer
so
phronsie
went
up
and
down
silently
by
his
side
for
a
few
more
turns
then
she
spoke
again
does
it
make
you
sorry
grandpapa
dear
to
have
me
want
charlotte
to
have
the
money
with
me
she
asked
timidly
no
no
child
answered
king
hastily
and
yet
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
do
feel
that
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
give
any
of
your
money
to
her
right
cried
phronsie
opening
her
brown
eyes
very
wide
why
the
money
my
very
own
grandpapa
yes
yes
of
course
but
you
are
too
young
to
judge
of
such
things
said
the
old
gentleman
decidedly
as
the
giving
away
of
property
and
all
that
oh
grandpapa
exclaimed
phronsie
in
gentle
reproach
and
standing
very
tall
why
i
am
thirteen
and
when
you
get
to
be
ten
years
older
you
might
blame
me
said
king
and
i
ca
say
but
what
you
have
reason
if
i
let
you
do
such
a
thing
as
to
give
away
any
money
to
charlotte
blame
you
why
grandpapa
i
could
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
then
threw
herself
convulsively
into
his
arms
her
face
working
hard
in
her
efforts
not
to
cry
but
it
was
no
use
and
king
caught
her
in
time
to
see
the
quick
drops
roll
down
phronsie
cheek
and
to
feel
them
fall
on
his
hand
oh
dear
me
he
cried
in
great
distress
there
there
child
you
shall
give
away
the
whole
if
you
wish
i
enough
for
you
without
it
only
do
cry
phronsie
you
may
do
anything
you
like
dear
there
mopping
up
her
wet
little
face
with
his
handkerchief
now
that
a
good
child
phronsie
you
are
not
going
to
cry
of
course
not
there
do
smile
a
bit
that
my
girl
now
as
a
faint
light
stole
into
phronsie
eyes
i
did
mean
you
really
blame
me
only
i
could
still
said
phronsie
and
it
looked
as
if
the
shower
were
about
to
fall
again
i
know
child
you
think
your
old
grandpapa
does
just
about
right
said
king
soothingly
and
highly
gratified
he
ever
and
always
right
said
phronsie
still
not
moving
bless
you
child
cried
the
old
gentleman
much
moved
i
wish
i
could
say
i
believed
what
you
say
but
many
things
in
my
life
might
have
been
bettered
oh
no
grandpapa
protested
phronsie
in
a
tone
of
horror
they
could
have
been
better
do
grandpapa
do
she
caught
him
around
the
neck
imploringly
well
i
wo
child
promised
king
holding
her
close
and
now
phronsie
i
tell
you
i
think
of
all
this
that
you
and
i
have
talked
over
and
i
let
you
know
by
and
by
what
you
ought
to
do
about
it
and
you
must
say
anything
about
it
to
anybody
not
to
a
single
soul
child
it
shall
be
just
a
secret
between
you
and
me
i
wo
grandpapa
said
phronsie
obediently
and
patting
his
broad
back
with
her
soft
hand
and
meantime
said
king
quite
satisfied
why
charlotte
is
having
pretty
good
times
i
think
polly
is
looking
out
for
that
polly
is
making
her
have
beautiful
times
said
phronsie
happily
oh
very
beautiful
times
indeed
grandpapa
i
expect
she
an
awful
nuisance
the
old
gentleman
broke
out
suddenly
oh
grandpapa
exclaimed
phronsie
breaking
away
from
him
to
look
into
his
face
well
well
perhaps
i
should
say
quite
that
said
king
correcting
himself
but
well
now
phronsie
you
run
back
to
your
play
child
and
i
set
to
work
at
once
to
think
out
this
matter
i
was
writing
a
note
to
fargo
said
phronsie
putting
up
her
lips
for
a
kiss
you
are
sure
you
wo
make
your
head
ache
thinking
about
it
grandpapa
she
asked
anxiously
sure
as
i
can
be
phronsie
said
old
king
smiling
dear
see
here
pickering
cabot
threw
wide
the
door
of
his
private
office
with
a
nervous
hand
it
is
time
i
had
a
good
talk
with
you
come
in
i
never
get
one
nowadays
ca
stop
uncle
said
pickering
hastily
besides
what
would
be
the
use
you
never
see
anything
encouraging
about
me
or
my
career
and
i
believe
i
am
going
to
the
dogs
indeed
you
are
not
pickering
cried
cabot
quickly
the
color
rising
to
his
cheek
there
there
my
sister
boy
shall
never
say
that
but
come
in
come
in
he
laid
hold
of
pickering
arm
and
gently
forced
him
into
the
little
room
not
to
be
ungracious
the
young
man
threw
himself
into
a
chair
well
what
is
it
uncle
do
out
with
it
i
in
no
mood
for
a
lecture
though
this
morning
i
not
going
to
lecture
you
my
boy
said
cabot
closing
the
door
then
going
to
the
mantel
to
lean
one
elbow
on
it
a
favorite
attitude
of
his
while
he
scanned
his
nephew
but
something
worse
than
common
has
come
to
you
can
i
help
in
any
way
no
no
do
ask
me
ejaculated
pickering
striking
his
knee
with
one
glove
and
turning
apprehensively
in
his
chair
oh
hang
it
uncle
why
ca
you
let
me
alone
i
seen
this
thing
whatever
it
is
coming
upon
you
for
sometime
said
cabot
too
nervous
to
notice
the
entreaty
in
pickering
voice
and
manner
and
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
to
find
out
the
trouble
my
right
pickering
you
have
no
father
to
see
to
you
and
i
always
wanted
to
have
the
best
success
be
yours
he
turned
away
his
head
now
a
break
coming
in
his
voice
illustration
i
not
going
to
lecture
you
you
have
uncle
you
have
assented
pickering
brought
out
a
trifle
from
his
distress
but
then
i
not
equal
to
the
strain
my
relatives
put
upon
me
not
worth
it
either
he
added
relapsing
into
his
gloom
then
he
shoved
his
chair
so
that
he
could
not
look
his
uncle
in
the
face
and
bent
a
steady
glance
out
of
the
window
cabot
gave
a
nervous
start
that
carried
him
away
from
the
mantel
a
step
or
two
but
when
he
was
there
he
felt
so
much
worse
that
he
soon
got
back
into
the
old
position
i
do
see
pickering
he
resumed
why
you
should
get
along
you
through
college
which
is
a
wonder
interpolated
pickering
well
i
ca
say
but
that
i
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
at
one
time
said
cabot
frankly
but
never
mind
that
now
you
are
through
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
nicely
established
with
van
metre
and
cartwright
it
the
best
law
firm
in
the
town
pickering
cabot
brought
his
elbow
off
from
the
mantel
enough
to
smite
his
palms
together
smartly
in
enthusiasm
i
got
you
in
there
i
know
you
did
uncle
said
pickering
you
done
everything
good
only
i
repeat
i
not
worth
it
and
he
drummed
on
the
for
heaven
sake
pickering
cried
his
uncle
darting
in
front
of
the
chair
and
its
restless
occupant
do
say
that
again
it
enough
to
make
a
man
go
to
the
bad
to
lose
hope
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
do
you
gamble
what
do
you
take
me
for
demanded
pickering
starting
to
his
feet
with
flashing
eyes
and
throwing
open
his
as
if
the
weight
oppressed
him
i
been
a
lazy
dog
all
my
life
and
a
but
i
hope
i
not
sunk
to
that
oh
nothing
nothing
i
sure
i
did
mean
cried
cabot
starting
back
suddenly
in
astonishment
dear
me
pickering
taking
off
his
eyeglasses
to
blow
his
nose
you
need
pick
me
up
so
violently
i
been
much
worried
about
you
settling
his
glasses
again
for
another
look
at
his
nephew
and
i
ca
tolerate
any
thoughts
i
can
not
speak
i
should
think
not
retorted
pickering
shortly
the
trouble
is
in
having
the
thoughts
and
i
am
very
much
relieved
to
find
that
my
fears
are
groundless
that
you
been
about
nothing
that
my
sister
or
i
should
be
ashamed
of
and
he
picked
up
courage
to
step
forward
gingerly
and
pat
the
young
man
on
the
shoulder
you
are
in
trouble
though
and
i
insist
on
knowing
what
it
is
pickering
dropped
suddenly
beneath
his
uncle
hand
into
the
nearest
chair
chapter
xi
things
are
getting
mixed
how
can
you
ask
me
uncle
cried
pickering
passionately
because
i
will
know
cabot
was
quite
determined
well
then
if
you
must
have
it
it
it
polly
pepper
pickering
could
get
no
further
it
polly
pepper
ejaculated
cabot
then
a
light
broke
over
his
face
and
he
laughed
aloud
he
was
so
pleased
you
mean
you
are
in
love
with
polly
pepper
as
if
everybody
did
know
it
cried
pickering
hotly
do
pretend
uncle
that
you
are
surprised
he
was
really
disrespectful
now
in
manner
oh
beg
pardon
sir
recovering
himself
never
mind
said
cabot
indulgently
you
are
this
morning
my
boy
and
he
came
over
and
clapped
his
nephew
on
the
back
approvingly
that
the
best
thing
you
ever
told
me
you
make
me
very
happy
and
hold
uncle
cried
pickering
darting
away
from
the
hand
do
go
so
fast
you
are
taking
too
much
for
granted
cabot
for
answer
bestowed
another
rap
this
time
on
arm
indulging
all
the
while
in
the
broadest
of
smiles
just
then
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
in
response
to
unwilling
come
in
ben
head
appeared
beg
pardon
cabot
but
van
metre
wants
you
out
here
pickering
lunged
past
ben
do
stop
me
he
cried
crossly
in
response
to
ben
well
old
fellow
ben
stared
after
him
with
puzzled
eyes
as
he
shot
down
the
long
store
and
all
that
afternoon
he
could
not
get
pickering
and
his
strange
ways
out
of
his
mind
and
on
the
edge
of
the
twilight
jumping
out
of
his
car
at
the
corner
nearest
home
he
buttoned
up
his
coat
and
rushed
on
regardless
that
billy
harlowe
was
making
frantic
endeavors
to
overtake
him
what
got
into
the
old
chap
said
ben
to
himself
pushing
on
doggedly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
thoughts
of
his
own
to
think
out
i
declare
if
i
should
know
pickering
dodge
lately
i
ca
tell
where
to
find
him
illustration
do
stop
me
cried
pickering
crossly
and
with
no
light
on
his
puzzle
ben
turned
into
the
stone
gateway
and
strode
up
to
the
east
porch
to
let
himself
in
as
usual
with
his
latch
key
as
he
was
fitting
it
absently
all
the
while
his
mind
more
intent
on
pickering
and
his
changed
demeanor
than
on
his
own
affairs
he
heard
a
little
rustling
noise
that
made
him
turn
his
head
to
see
a
tall
figure
spring
down
the
veranda
floor
in
haste
to
gain
the
quickest
angle
charlotte
why
what
are
you
doing
out
here
exclaimed
ben
leaving
his
key
in
the
lock
to
look
at
her
do
speak
begged
charlotte
hastily
and
coming
up
to
him
somebody
will
hear
you
i
came
out
here
to
walk
up
and
down
i
shall
die
in
that
house
and
i
am
going
home
she
nervously
twisted
her
handkerchief
around
her
fingers
and
ben
still
looking
at
her
closely
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
charlotte
what
are
you
talking
about
he
cried
opening
his
honest
blue
eyes
wide
at
her
why
i
thought
you
had
ever
so
much
sense
and
that
you
were
way
ahead
of
other
girls
except
polly
he
added
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
do
cried
charlotte
wincing
and
but
i
shall
go
home
look
here
ben
took
out
his
key
and
tucked
it
into
his
pocket
then
faced
charlotte
take
a
turn
up
and
down
charlotte
you
pull
out
of
your
bad
fit
you
homesick
ben
honest
face
glowed
with
pity
as
he
looked
at
her
i
i
everything
said
charlotte
desperately
o
ben
you
think
she
seized
his
arm
polly
is
just
having
a
dreadful
time
because
i
here
see
here
now
said
ben
taking
the
hand
on
his
arm
in
a
strong
grip
as
if
it
were
polly
do
you
go
to
getting
such
an
idea
into
your
head
charlotte
i
ca
help
it
said
charlotte
it
was
put
there
she
added
bitterly
ben
gave
a
start
of
surprise
well
you
are
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
believe
such
stuff
any
way
he
said
charlotte
pulled
away
her
hand
i
going
home
she
declared
flatly
indeed
you
are
not
said
ben
quite
as
decidedly
o
yes
i
am
we
see
he
nodded
at
her
take
my
advice
charlotte
and
make
a
muff
of
yourself
it
very
easy
for
you
to
talk
cried
charlotte
a
little
pink
spot
of
anger
rising
on
either
cheek
you
have
everybody
to
love
you
and
to
be
glad
you
are
here
very
easy
indeed
with
that
she
walked
off
swinging
her
gown
disdainfully
after
her
whew
ejaculated
ben
well
i
must
say
i
surprised
at
you
charlotte
i
did
suppose
you
could
be
jealous
jealous
charlotte
flamed
around
at
him
o
ben
pepper
what
do
you
mean
you
are
just
as
jealous
as
you
can
be
said
ben
honestly
absolutely
green
i
have
you
to
know
i
never
was
jealous
in
my
life
said
charlotte
quite
pale
now
and
standing
very
still
you
do
know
it
but
you
are
said
ben
imperturbably
when
people
begin
to
talk
about
other
folks
being
loved
and
happy
and
all
that
they
always
jealous
why
in
the
world
do
you
think
how
everybody
is
loving
you
and
wanting
to
make
you
happy
it
was
quite
a
long
speech
for
ben
and
he
was
overcome
with
astonishment
at
himself
for
having
made
it
illustration
i
going
home
declared
charlotte
because
they
are
not
said
charlotte
bitterly
at
least
they
love
me
if
they
do
try
to
make
me
happy
stuff
and
nonsense
exclaimed
ben
and
polly
then
charlotte
pulled
herself
up
well
what
about
polly
demanded
ben
oh
nothing
charlotte
twisted
uneasily
and
shut
her
lips
tightly
together
if
you
think
my
sister
polly
does
love
you
and
want
to
make
you
happy
there
no
use
in
my
talking
to
you
said
ben
in
a
displeased
way
i
did
say
so
cried
charlotte
quickly
oh
do
go
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
help
me
as
he
made
a
movement
toward
the
door
i
never
told
anybody
else
and
they
do
guess
and
it
a
pity
that
they
should
now
said
ben
i
tell
you
charlotte
if
you
never
say
anything
like
this
again
i
believe
that
you
the
girl
i
thought
you
with
plenty
of
sense
and
all
that
there
give
us
your
hand
hurry
up
now
here

phronsie
charlotte
slowly
laid
her
hand
in
ben
big
palm
as
phronsie
opened
the
oaken
door
and
peered
out
into
the
darkness
i
ca
think
what
makes
ben
so
late
she
said
softly
to
herself
i
going
into
the
other
door
said
charlotte
springing
off
down
the
veranda
halloo
pet
ben
rushed
into
the
hall
and
seized
phronsie
for
a
good
hug
o
ben
you
so
late
cried
phronsie
well
i
here
now
said
ben
comfortably

phronsie
with
a
delightful
air
of
mystery
to

to
tell
me
declared
ben
with
assurance
o
bensie

so
much
rather

guess
said
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
well
then

new
cat
said
ben
at
a
hazard
while
he
disposed
of
his
coat
and
hat
o
ben
cried
phronsie
in
reproach
why

given

i
have
since
when

ben
why

week
i
really

phronsie

at
the
sound
of
his
voice

there

on
they
wild
i
suppose
upstairs
to
tell
the
news
just
then
some
one
called
phronsie
oh

sighed
involuntarily
as
ben
sped
over
the

without

i
thought

said
polly
meeting
him

ben
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh

i
met
phronsie
if

must
know
of
course
laughed
polly
how
stupid
in
me
well
was
ever
anything
so
fine
in
all
this
world
and
she
danced
down
the
hall
and
came
back
flushed
and
panting
and
grandpapa
has
written
to
tell
cabot
how
it
is
and
to
ask
for
a
day
or
two
off
for
you
she
said
with
a
little
pat
on
his
back
o
polly
exclaimed
ben
in
dismay
grandpapa
should
i
mean
i
ought
not
to

really
rather

well
grandpapa
says
that
you

working
too
hard
bensie
and
quite
true
polly
gave
him
another
pat
this
time
a
motherly
one
and
so
you

going
but
ben
shook
his
head
and
we
start
ran
on
polly
and
jasper
does
know
a
word
about
our
coming
and
we
are
going
to
stay
at
the
hotel
two
or
three
days
and
here
phronsie
ran
eagerly
up
the
stairs
and
it
going
to
be
lovely
and
not
rain
any
of
the
time
and
we
are
to
take
jasper
a
box
full
of
everything
she
announced
in
great
excitement
we
began
to
pack
it
the
very
minute
that
grandpapa
told
us
we
were
to
go
that
fine
well
i
drop
something
into
that
box
said
ben
of
course
said
polly
in
great
satisfaction
and
jasper
would
like
it
not
to
have
something
of
ben
in
it
said
phronsie
well
now
bensie
run
down
after
dinner
and
ask
pickering
dodge
to
go
that
a
good
boy
polly
patted
the
broad
back
coaxingly
this
time
ben
face
fell
how
do
you
know
that
grandpapa
would
like
to
have
him
along
he
asked
abruptly
as
if
i
ask
you
to

him
cried
polly
unless
grandpapa
had
said
he
could
go
the
very
idea
ben
well
something

the
matter
with
pick
confessed
ben
unwillingly
and
i
do

matter
with
pickering
repeated
polly
in
dismay
o
ben

ben
bluntly
but

a
week
now
more
or
less
and
he
would
speak
to
me
just
shot
off
telling
me
to
let
him
alone
and
ben
rapidly
laid
before
polly
the
little
scene
of
the
morning
in
the
store
now
ben
said
polly
when
it
was
all
over

by
phronsie
ben
went
slowly
down
the
hall
to
get
ready
for
dinner
i
do

how
it
is
he
said
but
everything
seems
to
be
getting
mixed
up
in
this
house
and
all
our
good
quiet
times
gone
and
now
what
can
charlotte
have
heard
to
make
her
want
to

and
all
the
time
during

ben
kept
up
a
steady
thinking
until

caught
his
eye
do

her
smile
said
i
sent
a
note
to

straight
in
his
chair
and
nodded
back
at
her
i

that
pick

i
stewing
over
he
said
to

think

bothered
by

i
must
just
fuss
at

myself
till

out
so
when
pickering
dodge
with
a
radiant
face
at

of
his
trouble
do

in
an
agony
at

you
ridiculous
boy
asked
polly
quite
as

his
face
aflame
but
polly
if

i
really
could
help
it
jasper
was
do
tell
me
that
it
was
any
of
jasper

cried
polly
vehemently
clasping
her
hands
tightly
together
so
afraid
she
might
say
something
to
make
the
matter
worse
i
know
pickering
it
was
quite
your
own
fault
if

exclaimed
pickering
the
hot
blood
all
over
his
face
say
that

must
because
i
know
it
is
the
truth
said
polly
uncompromisingly
if
it
is
why
then
come
with
us
pickering
and
her
brow
cleared
i
ca
polly
i
ca
possibly
cried
pickering
in
distress
ask
me
anything
but
that
and
i
do
it
this
is
the
only
thing
that
you
ought
to
do
said
polly
coldly
o
pickering
suppose
that
anything
should
happen
so
that
you
never
could
speak
she
added
reproachfully
i
sure
i
do
want
to
speak
to
a
man
when
i
broken
friendship
with
him
said
pickering
sullenly
what
is
there
to
talk
about
like
to
know
if
you
broken
friendship
with
jasper
i
quite
quite
sure
it
is
your
own
fault
hotly
declared
polly
again
jasper
never
turned
away
from
a
friend
in
his
life
and
polly
broke
off
suddenly
and
walked
down
the
long
room
aghast
to
find
how
angry
she
was
at
each
step
do
you
turn
away
from
me
polly
begged
pickering
in
such
a
piteous
tone
that
polly
felt
little
twinges
of
remorse
and
in
a
minute
she
was
by
his
side
again
i
did
mean
to
be
cross
she
said
quickly
but
you
must
say
such
things
pickering
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
said
pickering
doggedly
and
that
is
that
i
broken
friendship
with
jasper
and
i
ca
speak
to
him
pickering
said
polly
whirling
abruptly
to
get
a
good
look
at
his
face
you
must
speak
to
jasper
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
i
tell
you
i
ca
said
pickering
his
face
paling
with
the
effort
to
control
himself
then
said
polly
very
deliberately
yet
with
a
glow
of
determination
you
ca
speak
to
me
so
pickering
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
pickering
stared
after
her
a
moment
in
a
dazed
way
then
picked
up
his
hat
and
darted
out
of
the
house
shutting
the
door
hard
behind
him
polly
hurrying
over
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
kept
saying
to
herself
over
and
over
oh
how
could
i
have
said
that
how
could
i
when
i
want
to
help
him
and
now
i
have
made
everything
worse
polly
called
fisher
as
polly
sped
by
her
door
you
are
going
to
take
the
noon
train
you
know
king
says
so
you
can
pack
in
the
morning
easily
i
not
going
mamsie
that
is
i
hope
we
are
not
any
of
us
going
said
polly
incoherently
as
she
tried
to
hurry
by
not
going
polly
child
what
do
you
mean
cried
fisher
aghast
o
mamsie
do
ask
me
begged
polly
having
hard
work
to
keep
the
tears
back
do
forgive
me
but
need
i
tell
and
polly
stopped
and
clung
to
the
knob
of
the
door
no
polly
if
you
can
not
tell
mother
your
trouble
willingly
i
will
not
ask
it
child
and
fisher
turned
off
and
began
to
busy
herself
over
her
work
polly
quite
broken
down
by
this
deserted
her
and
rushed
into
the
bedroom
o
mamsie
it
about
about
other
people
and
i
did
know
as
i
ought
to
tell
need
i
cried
polly
imploringly
seizing
her
mother
gown
just
as
phronsie
would
no
more
had
you
a
right
to
tell
polly
said
her
mother
if
that
is
the
case
and
she
turned
a
cheerful
face
toward
her
i
can
trust
my
girl
that
she
wo
keep
anything
that
is
her
own
away
from
me
there
there
and
she
smoothed
polly
brown
hair
with
her
hand
how
i
used
to
be
always
telling
you
to
brush
your
hair
and
now
how
nice
it
looks
polly
she
added
approvingly
it
the
same
hair
now
said
polly
throwing
back
her
rebellious
locks
with
an
impatient
toss
of
the
head
oh
how
i
do
wish
i
had
smooth
hair
like
charlotte
hair
when
it
taken
care
of
as
it
ought
to
be
observed
fisher
is
one
thing
and
when
it
all
sixes
and
sevens
because
a
girl
does
have
time
to
brush
it
is
another
your
hair
is
all
right
now
polly
there
go
child
and
she
dismissed
her
with
a
final
loving
pat
i
can
trust
you
and
when
your
worry
gets
too
big
for
you
why
bring
it
to
mother
so
polly
up
in
her
own
room
at
last
crept
into
a
corner
and
there
went
over
every
word
bitterly
lamenting
what
she
had
done
at
last
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
she
sprang
up
i
write
a
note
to
pickering
and
say
i
am
sorry
she
cried
to
herself
maybe
ben
will
take
it
to
him
o
dear
i
forgot
ben
is
vexed
with
him
but
perhaps
he
will
leave
it
at
the
door
any
way
i
ask
him
so
polly
scribbled
down
hastily
dear
pickering
i
am
so
sorry
i
said
those
words
to
you
i
do
see
how
i
came
to
do
forget
them
and
forgive
polly
ben
ben
polly
ran
over
the
stairs
nervously
twirling
the
little
note
o
dear
me
where
are

ben
here
called
ben
in
mamsie
oh

beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
polly
throwing
wide
the
door
on
the
ben

having
with
charlotte

ben
his
blue
eyes
glowing
with
welcome

charlotte
and
i
were
having
a
bit
of
a
talk
but
we
through
now
what

a
good
look
at
polly
face
o
ben
if
you
could
began
polly
fearfully
it
only
this
waving
the
note
with
trembling
fingers
now
do
say
you
will
take
this
note
to
pickering
dodge
why
i
thought
you
sent
him
a
note
before
dinner
said
ben
in
surprise
so
i
did
and
he
came
said
polly
her
head
drooping
in
a
shamefaced
way
and
i
was
cross
to
him
o
polly
you
cross
to
him
exclaimed
ben
as
if
i
believe
that
while
charlotte
stared
at
her
with
wide
eyes
i
truly
was
confessed
polly
there
do
stop
ben
to
talk
about
it
please
but
do
take
this
note
thrusting
it
at
him
but
ben
shook
his
head
i
thought
i
told
you
polly
that
pick

to
speak
to
me
how
in
the
world
can
i
go
at
him
at

charlotte
stared
worse
than
ever
you
need
go
in
the
house
said
polly
just
leave
it
at
the
door
ah
do
ben
she
went
up
to
him
and
coaxingly
patted
his
cheek
all
right
as
long
as
you
do
want
me
to
bore
him
said
ben
slowly
getting
out
of
his
chair
here
give
us
your
note
polly
of
course
you
make
me
do
as
you
say
you
just
as
splendid
as
you
can
be
cried
polly
joyfully
there
now
bensie
pushing
the
note
into
his
hand
do
hurry
that
a
good
boy
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ben
rushed
in
meeting
polly
in
the
hall
kis
face
aglow
and
eyes
shining
here
polly
catch
it
tossing
her
a
note
that
from
pick
why
did
you
see
him
asked
polly
in
amazement
yes
could
help
it
he
was
rushing
out
the
door
like
a
whirlwind
and
we
came
together
on
the
steps
said
ben
with
a
burst
of
laughter
at
the
remembrance
and
we
spoke
before
we
meant
to
could
help
it
you
know
just
ran
into
each
other
and
he
read
your
note
and
then
he
flew
into
the
house
and
was
gone
a
moment
or
two
and
came
back
mumbling
it
was
all
his
fault
and
he
written
that
you
understand
or
something
of
that
sort
and
he
gave
me
this
note
to
carry
back
and
i
guess
pick
is
all
right
polly
ben
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
after
he
got
through
he
was
so
unaccustomed
to
long
speeches
polly
tore
open
her
note
and
stooped
to
read
it
by
the
dancing
flames
of
the
hall
fire
to
show
that
i
forgive
you
polly
i
go
with
you
all
to
see
jasper
pickering
wo
jasper
be
surprised
phronsie
kept
exclaiming
over
and
over
when
they
were
once
fairly
in
the
cars
much
to
old
king
delight
who
never
tired
of
congratulating
himself
on
planning
the
outing
grandpapa
dear
i
do
think
it
was
oh
so
lovely
in
you
to
take
us
all
well
jasper
has
been
working
hard
lately
said
the
old
gentleman
and
it
will
be
no
end
of
good
to
him
even
if
it
does
agree
with
you
my
pet
pinching
phronsie
ear
oh
but
it
does
agree
with
me
said
phronsie
in
great
satisfaction
very
much
indeed
grandpapa
so
it
seems
said
the
old
gentleman
well
now
phronsie
glancing
around
at
the
rest
of
his
party
everything
is
moving
on
well
and
i
believe
i
take
a
bit
of
a
nap
that
is
if
that
youngster
with
a
nod
toward
the
end
of
the
car
will
allow
me
to
i
do
believe
that
baby
will
cry
any
more
said
phronsie
with
a
hopeful
glance
whence
the
disturbing
sounds
came
he
ca
grandpapa
he
cried
so
much
now
do
lean
your
head
back
i
going
to
put
this
rug
under
it
and
phronsie
began
to
pull
out
a
traveling
blanket
from
the
roll
polly
across
the
car
aisle
laid
down
her
book
and
clambered
out
her
seat
let
me
take
baby
she
said
coming
up
unsteadily
to
the
pale
little
woman
who
was
endeavoring
to
pacify
a
stout
boy
a
year
old
just
beginning
on
a
fresh
series
of
roars
an
old
gentleman
in
the
seat
back
laid
down
the
paper
he
had
been
trying
to
read
to
see
the
fresh
attempts
on
the
small
disturber
he
tire
you
out
miss
said
the
pale
little
woman
deprecatingly
there
there
johnny
do
be
still
with
an
uneasy
pull
at
johnny
red
skirt
indeed
he
wo
laughed
polly
merrily
hearing
this
johnny
stopped
beating
the
window
in
the
vain
effort
to
get
out
and
deliberately
looked
polly
over
i
like
babies
added
polly
and
if
you
let
me
to
the
little
mother
i
going
to
play
with
this
one
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
sat
down
in
the
end
of
the
seat
and
held
out
her
hands
alluringly
to
johnny
young
lady
there
are
babies
and
babies
observed
the
old
gentleman
solemnly
and
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
seat
he
regarded
polly
over
his
spectacles
with
pitying
eyes
and
i
advise
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
one
but
johnny
was
already
scrambling
all
over
polly
traveling
gown
and
she
was
laughing
at
him
and
presently
the
pale
little
woman
was
stretched
comfortably
on
the
opposite
seat
her
eyes
closed
restfully
well
done
cried
the
old
gentleman
i
read
my
paper
while
the
calm
spell
lasts
as
the
train
rumbled
on
the
sound
only
broken
by
delighted
little
gurgles
as
polly
played
rabbit
and
fox
for
his
delectation
phronsie
looked
down
the
intervening
space
and
heaved
a
sigh
at
employment
do
worry
i
like
it
telegraphed
polly
nodding
away
to
her
so
phronsie
turned
again
to
her
watch
lest
grandpapa
head
should
slip
from
the
blanket
pillow
in
a
sudden
lurch
of
the
cars
i
help
her
if
i
knew
how
charlotte
several
seats
off
groaned
to
herself
but
that
lump
of
a
baby
would
only
roar
at
me
dear
dear
am
i
never
to
be
any
good
to
polly
she
leaned
her
troubled
face
against
the
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
old
thoughts
what
did
ben
say
she
cried
suddenly
flying
away
from
the
window
so
abruptly
that
she
involuntarily
glanced
around
to
be
quite
sure
that
none
of
her
were
laughing
at
her
may
be
sure
charlotte
if
you
keep
on
the
lookout
there
will
a
time
come
for
you
to
help
polly
that
what
he
said
and
i
hold
fast
to
it
on
and
on
the
train
rumbled
the
little
mother
woke
up
with
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
pink
color
on
her
cheeks
i
have
had
such
a
sleep
in
weeks
she
said
gratefully
then
she
leaned
forward
i
take
johnny
now
she
said
you
must
be
so
tired
but
johnny
roared
out
no
and
beat
her
off
with
small
fists
and
feet
he
going
to
sleep
said
polly
looking
down
at
him
snuggled
up
tightly
within
her
arm
his
heavy
eyelids
slowly
drooping
then
put
him
down
on
the
seat
and
tuck
him
up
for
a
good
long
nap
at
the
word
sleep
johnny
screamed
out
no
no
and
thrust
his
fat
knuckles
into
his
eyes
while
he
tried
to
sit
up
straight
in
lap
there
there
cried
polly
soothingly
now
fly
back
little
bird
into
your
nest
johnny
showed
all
the
small
white
teeth
he
possessed
in
a
gleeful
laugh
and
burrowed
deeper
than
before
within
the
kind
arm
as
he
tried
to
play
with
her
you
see
said
polly
to
the
little
mother
worried
look
he
soon
be
off
in
nodland
she
added
softly
i
never
had
any
one
be
so
good
to
me
said
johnny
mother
brokenly
as
you
miss
is
johnny
your
only
little
boy
asked
polly
to
stop
the
flow
of
gratitude
yes
miss
i
buried
four
children
oh
exclaimed
polly
quite
hushed
the
little
mother
wiped
away
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
looked
out
of
the
window
steadily
fixing
her
gaze
on
the
distant
landscape
and
the
train
sped
on
but
the
worst
is
the
father
is
gone
she
turned
again
to
polly
then
glanced
down
at
her
black
dress
johnny
and
me
have
no
one
now
do
try
to
tell
me
cried
polly
involuntarily
if
it
pains
you
she
would
have
taken
the
thin
hand
in
hers
but
johnny
uneasy
breathing
showed
him
still
contesting
every
inch
of
progress
the
children
sandman
was
making
toward
him
and
she
did
dare
to
move
it
does
me
good
said
the
little
woman
somehow
i
must
tell
you
miss
and
now
i
going
to
fall
river
somebody
told
me
i
get
work
there
in
the
print
mills
you
see
i
have
any
father
nor
mother
nor
anybody
belonging
to
johnny
father
nor
me
are
you
sure
of
getting
work
when
you
reach
fall
river
asked
polly
feeling
all
the
thrill
of
a
great
lonely
world
for
two
such
little
helpless
beings
to
be
cast
adrift
in
it
no
said
the
little
woman
but
it
a
big
mill
they
say
and
has
to
have
lots
of
women
in
it
and
there
must
be
a
place
for
me
i
do
think
that
times
are
going
to
be
good
now
for
johnny
and
me
and
a
crash
like
that
when
the
lightning
begins
on
deadly
work
a
surging
helpless
tossing
from
side
to
side
when
the
hands
strike
blindly
out
on
either
side
for
something
to
cling
to
a
sudden
fall
down
down
to
unknown
depths
a
confused
medley
of
shouts
and
one
long
shuddering
scream
oh
what
began
polly
holding
to
johnny
through
it
all
and
then
she
knew
no
more
chapter
xiii
the
accident
a
roaring
sound
close
to
her
ear
made
polly
start
and
open
her
eyes
johnny
fat
arms
were
clutched
around
her
neck
so
tightly
she
could
scarcely
breathe
while
he
was
screaming
as
hard
as
he
could
is
the
matter
cried
polly
finishing
her
sentence
a
pair
of
strong
arms
were
lifting
her
up
and
pulling
her
from
beneath
something
she
could
not
tell
what
that
was
lying
heavily
over
her
while
johnny
rolled
off
like
a
ball
o
ben
cried
polly
gratefully
as
the
arms
carried
her
off
and
then
she
saw
the
face
above
her
why
pickering
are
you
hurt
anywhere
gasped
pickering
speaking
the
words
with
difficulty
what
is
it
cried
polly
in
a
dazed
way
there
been
an
accident
said
pickering
oh
polly
say
you
not
hurt
as
he
set
her
carefully
down
an
accident
exclaimed
polly
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
glanced
wildly
around
pickering
where
where
she
could
ask
are
phronsie
and
ben
and
grandpapa
but
pickering
cried
at
once
all
right
every
single
one
here

and
ben
too
and
phronsie
running
up
with
streaming
hair
and
white
cheeks
threw
glad
arms
around
her
neck
oh
polly
are
you
hurt
and
ben
seized
her
but
at
that
she
winced
and
her
left
arm
fell
heavily
to
her
side
where
baby
cried
polly
trying
to
cover
up
the
expression
of
pain
do
somebody
look
after
him
charlotte
has
him
said
phronsie
looking
off
to
a
grassy
bank
by
the
railroad
track
where
charlotte
chatterton
sat
with
johnny
in
her
lap
polly
followed
the
glance
then
off
to
the
broken
car
one
end
of
which
lay
in
ruins
across
the
rails
and
to
the
crowds
of
people
running
to
the
scene
in
the
midst
of
which
was
the
fearful
hush
that
proclaimed
death
oh
do
come
and
help
called
polly
and
before
they
knew
it
she
was
dashing
off
and
running
over
the
grass
up
to
the
track
there
was
a
woman
johnny
mother
she
cried
pushing
her
way
into
the
crowd
phronsie
and
ben
and
pickering
close
behind
in
the
seat
opposite
me
two
or
three
men
were
picking
up
a
still
figure
they
had
just
pried
out
from
the
ruins
of
the
dropped
helplessly
on
its
side
just
as
it
fell
when
the
fatal
blow
came
let
me
see
her
said
polly
hoarsely
they
turned
the
face
obediently
there
was
a
long
terrible
gash
on
the
forehead
that
showed
death
to
have
come
instantly
to
johnny
mother
and
that
good
times
had
already
begun
for
her
and
her
weary
feet
were
safely
at
rest
in
the
heavenly
home
polly
drew
a
long
breath
and
bending
suddenly
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
peaceful
cheek
then
she
drew
out
her
handkerchief
and
softly
laid
it
over
the
dead
face
take
her
to
that
farmhouse
she
pointed
to
a
large
white
house
off
in
the
fields

sitting
on

beseeching
finger
oh

ben
quickly
only
in
this
end
of
the
car
see
polly
everybody
is
out
pointing
past
the
crowd
into
the
car
to
the
vacant
seats
there
was
an
old
gentleman
in
the
seat
back
of
me
cried
polly
in
distress

any
one
seen

running
up
and
down
the
track

old
gentleman
with
a
black
velvet
cap
amid
shouts
of
keep
out
the
car
is
taking
fire
do

near
it
a
little
tongue
of
flame
shooting
from
one
of
the
windows
at
the
further
end
of
the
car
proclaimed
this
fact
without
the
words
has
no
one
seen
him
called
polly
in
a
voice
so
clear
and
piercing
that
it
rose
above
the
babel
of
the
crowd
and
the
groans
of
one
or
two
injured
people
drawn
out
from
the
ruin
and
lying
on
the
bank
waiting
the
surgeon
arrival
then
he
must
be
in
the
car
oh
ben

we
must
get
him
out
and
she
sprang
back
toward
the
broken
car
end
keep
back
polly
commanded
ben
and
i
shall
go
cried
pickering
dodge
but
polly
ran
too
and
clambered
with
them
over
the
crushed
car
seats
and
window
frames
of
the
ruin
he
not
here
cried
ben
while
the
hot
flame
seemed
to
be
sweeping
with
cruel
haste
down
to
catch
them
look
oh
he
must
be
cried
polly
wildly
peering
into
the
ruin
oh
ben
i
see
a
hand
but
a
rough
grasp
on
her
shoulder
seized
her
as
the
words
left
her
mouth
come
out
of
here
miss
or
you
be
killed
and
polly
was
being
borne
off
by
rescuers
who
had
seen
her
rush
with
the
two
young
men
in
amongst
the
ruin
i
tell

cried
polly
struggling
to
get
free
there
is
an
old
gentleman
buried
in
there
i
saw
his
hand
everybody
is
out
miss
and
they
carried
her
off
but
ben
and
pickering
were
already
in
a
race
with
the
flames
for
the
possession
of
the
old
gentleman
whose
body
after
the
car
seat
was
removed
could
plainly
be
seen
there
the
axe
cried
ben
hoarsely
pointing
to
it
where
it
had
fallen
near
to
pickering
pickering
measured
the
approach
of
the
flames
with
a
careful
eye
he
is
probably
dead
he
said
to
ben
shall
we
hand
the
axe
cried
ben
already
the
car
was
at
a
stifling
heat
and
the
roar
of
the
flames
grew
perilously
near
would
no
one
come
to
help
them
must
they
die
like
animals
in
a
trap
well
the
work
was
to
be
done
two
three
ringing
blows
breaking
away
a
heavy
beam
quick
agile
pulling
up
of
the
broken
window
frame
and
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
flames
young
arms
bore
out
the
old
body
a
great
shout
burst
from
the
crowd
as
they
staggered
forth
with
their
burden
pickering
had
only
strength
to
look
around
for
polly
before
he
dropped
on
the
grass
and
when
he
looked
up
the
tears
were
raining
on
his
face
o
pickering
cried
polly
now
there
is
anything
more
to
long
for
you
are
all
right
pickering
lifted
his
head
feebly
and
glanced
around
the
walls
of
the
spare
room
at
the
gay
in
large
flowered
paper
met
his
eyes
why
where
am
i
he
began
at
good
farmer
higby
said
polly
and
then
he
saw
that
her
arm
was
in
a
sling
that
nothing
she
finished
meeting
his
look
it
all
fixed
as
good
as
can
be
and
has
nothing
to
do
but
get
well
has
it
ben
ben
popped
up
his
head
from
the
depths
of
the
easy
chair
where
he
had
crouched
afraid
lest
pickering
should
revive
and
see
him
too
suddenly
how
are
you
old
fellow
he
now
cried
advancing
toward
the
bed
there
do
try
to
speak
hurriedly
everything
is
all
right
wait
till
you
are
better
how
long
have
i
been
here
asked
pickering
looking
at
polly
arm
only
a
day
said
polly
and
now

must
have
something
to
eat
starting
toward
the
door

could
eat
a
mouthful
said
pickering
shutting
his
mouth
and
turning
on
the
pillow
indeed

will
declared
polly
hurrying
on
the
doctor
said
as
soon
as
you
could
talk

must
have
something
to
eat
and
i
shall
tell
higby
to
bring
it
up
so
she
disappeared
goodness
me

i
had
the
doctor
asked
pickering
turning
back
to
look
after
her
yes
said
ben
then
he
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
but
pickering
broke
in
did
polly
break
her
arm
at
at
the
first
he
asked
holding
his
breath
for
the
answer
yes
said
ben
do
talk
about
it
with
a
gasp
polly
says
that
she
is
so
glad
it
is
her
right
arm
he
added
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
and
the
doctor
promises
it
will
be
all
right
soon
lucky
there
is
a
good
one
here
pickering
groaned
it
a
pity
i
was
in
the
old
fellow
place
ben
he
said
for
i
got
to
tell
polly
how
i
wanted
to
leave
him
and
i
rather

her
face

here
cried
ben
if
you
say
one
word
to
polly
about
it
pitch
you
out
of
the
window
sick
as
you
are
pitch
ahead
then
said
pickering
for
i

said
ben
resolutely
well
but
i
shall
tell
her

said
pickering
i
rather
she
knew
it
but
i
wish
we
could
have
saved
him
he
in
the
other
room
said
ben
suddenly
poor
old
thing
to
die
like
that
die
he
as
well
as
a
fish
said
ben
sitting
up
in
an
easy
chair
and
to
my
certain
knowledge
eating
dried
herrings
and
cheese
at
this
very
minute
he
eating
dried
herrings
and
cheese
repeated
pickering
nearly
skipping
out
of
bed
why
was
he
dead
when
we
brought
him
out
no
only
stunned
there
do
get
back
said
ben
pushing
pickering
well
under
the
blankets
again
the
doctor
says
on
no
account

you
to
get
up
until
he
came
do
keep
still

be
here
presently
with
a
glance
at
higby
chimney
clock
the
doctor
who
cares
for
him
cried
pickering
nevertheless
he
scrambled
back
again
and
allowed
ben
to
tuck
him
in
tightly
and
presently
in
came
polly
and
after
her
a
bright
woman
bearing
a
tray
on
which
steamed
a
bowl
of
gruel
illustration
old
king
drew
up
his
chair
to
oversee
it
all
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
pickering
was
bolstered
up
against
his
pillows
and
obediently
opening
his
mouth
at
the
right
times
to
admit
of
the
spoonfuls
polly
held
out
to
him
and
phronsie
came
in
and
perched
on
the
foot
of
the
gravely
watching
it
all
and
old
king
followed
drawing
up
the
easy
chair
to
the
bedside
where
he
could
oversee
the
whole
thing
and
before
it
was
over
the
door
opened
and
a
young
man
with
a
professional
air
looked
in
and
said
in
great
satisfaction
that
good
coming
up
to
the
bed
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
pickering
here

flourish
of
his
palm

polly
cheerfully
and
trying

begged
phronsie
slipping
from
the
bed
while

arm
polly

said
the
doctor
moving
down
to
the
foot
of
the
where
he
stood
looking
at
the
feeding
process
and
i
can
go
in
and
see

meanwhile
pickering
dodged
the
spoon
nearly
in
his
mouth
who

polly
trying
to

the
gruel
drops
from

bravely
jack
loughead

and
he
pickering
gave
a
groan
and
turned
on
his
pillow

polly
he
said
putting
up
his
hand
polly
set
the
spoon
in
the
gruel
bowl
with
a
disappointed
air
never

said
the
young
doctor
coming
back
again
he
eaten
enough
now

see
your
arm
he
turned
to
polly
gently
we
must
go
in
the
other
room
for
that
with
a
nod
at
pickering
a
thrill
went
over
phronsie
which
she
tried
her
best
to
conceal
and
she
turned
quite
pale
polly
smiled
at
her
as
she
went
over
toward
the
door
followed
by
the
doctor
old
king
and
ben
pickering
dodge
clenched
his
hand
under
the
bedclothes
and
looked
after
them
then
steadfastly
gazed
at
the
large
flowers
blooming
with
reckless
abandon
up
and
down
over
the
phronsie
said
polly
hearing
her
footsteps
joining
the
others
out
in
the
hall
will
you
go
in
and
see
how
charlotte
is
getting
on
with

she
whispered
in
phronsie
ear
as
she
gained
her
side
i
rather

polly
said
phronsie
wistfully
and
hold
your
other
hand
but
i
do

charlotte
said
polly
beseechingly
will

phronsie
and
she
set
a
kiss
on
phronsie
pale
cheek
i
will
polly
said
phronsie
with
a
sigh
but
she
looked
back
as
she
went
slowly
along
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
please
do
hurt
polly
she
said
imploringly
to
the
doctor
i
wo
little
girl
he
replied
any
more
than
i
can
help
called
polly
cheerfully
and
she
threw
her
a
kiss
with
her
right
hand
farmer
higby
stood
on
her
flat
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
seems
if
i
ever
get
over
the
shock
she
said
to
herself
looking
off
to
the
railroad
track
shining
in
the
morning
sunlight
to
look
up
from
my
sewing
and
see
la
and
was
the
first
time
i
ever
sat
down
to
that
since
i
had
to
drop
it
and
run
over
and
take
care
of
simon
when
they
brought
me
word
he
was
cut
to
pieces
in
the
mowing
machine
my
senses
i
afraid
to
finish
the
thing
the
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
began
to
deepen
and
she
shook
as
if
the
chill
of
a
winter
day
were
upon
her
instead
of
the
soft
air
of
a
mild
morning
in
spring
i
want
to
get
out
in
the
woods
and
holler
she
declared
seems
if
then
i
feel
better
to
look
up
expecting
to
see
the
cars
coming
along
real
lively
and
pleasant
just
as
they
always
do
so
when
i
sewing
and
then
oh
dear
me
she
wrung
her
fat
hands
together
there
all
of
a
sudden
were
two
of
bumping
together
one
end
smashed
into
kindling
wood
and
end
sticking
up
straight
in
the
air
oh
my
senses
i
do
wonder
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy
and
that
i
let
the
rug
fly
and
jumped
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
till
i
heard
the
screaming
and
i
run
to
help
and
there
was
that
poor
soul
they
were
bringing
here
and
she
dead
as
a
stone
oh
dear
dear
higby
turned
away
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
shining
railroad
track
and
looked
off
over
the
meadow
while
a
happier
expression
came
over
her
features
i
awful
tickled
this
house
is
big
she
said
with
a
good
degree
of
comfort
so
jotham
and
me
could
take
in
now
glad
we
did
sell
last
spring
when
mary
ann
was
married
and
move
down
to
the
village
seems
if
providence
was
in
it
gracious
see
that
man
running
here
i
hope
there
ai
anything
else
happened
and
with
her
old
flutter
upon
her
higby
turned
to
meet
a
young
man
advancing
to
the
with
more
speed
than
was
ordinarily
exhibited
by
the
natives
of
brierly
is
this
jotham
higby
house
asked
the
stranger
and
although
he
was
very
pale
and
evidently
troubled
he
touched
his
hat
and
waited
for
her
answer
yes
said
higby
what
do
you
want
do
excuse
me
all
in
the
same
breath
but
i
all
upset
there
was
an
awful
railroad
accident
along
here
yesterday
you
have
come
to
tell
of
anything
else
bad
have
you
and
she
was
sharper
than
ever
no
said
the
young
man
my
friends
are
here
you
took
them
in
so
kindly
do
show
me
the
way
to
them
he
was
quite
imperative
now
moving
over
the
flat
stone
and
into
the
square
entry
like
one
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
which
way
he
asked
glancing
up
the
stairs
oh
my
exclaimed
higby
excuse
me
sir
the
rooms
upstairs
nodding
like
a
mandarin
in
the
direction
named
any
of
all
of
they
got
all
you
ca
make
a
miss
the
young
man
was
already
opening
the
door
of
the
room
where
bryce
was
examining
polly
arm
old
king
and
ben
looking
on
anxiously
polly
saw
him
first
oh
jasper
she
cried
with
a
sudden
start
take
care
exclaimed
bryce
looking
off
from
the
bandages
he
was
nicely
adjusting
to
bestow
a
keen
glance
on
jasper
jasper
gave
one
hand
to
his
father
in
passing
but
went
straight
to
polly
side
and
laid
his
other
hand
on
her
shoulder
it
all
right
jasper
said
polly
seeing
he
could
speak
doctor
says
my
arm
is
doing
beautifully
well
well
said
old
king
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
but
only
succeeding
in
a
nervous
effort
this
is
just
the
most
successful
way
to
give
you
a
surprise
party
jasper
but
it
the
best
we
could
do
and
we
had
to
send
you
a
telegram
for
fear
you
see
it
in
the
papers
so
you
thought
you
come
on
and
see
for
yourself
eh
as
jasper
showed
no
inclination
to
talk
yes
said
jasper
still
confining
himself
to
monosyllables
and
that
the
sensible
thing
to
do
said
ben
with
a
grateful
look
at
jasper
than
to
wait
till
we
are
able
to
move
on
pickering
and
all
is
pickering
dodge
with
you
exclaimed
jasper
quickly
polly
turned
in
her
chair
and
looked
into
his
eyes
yes
pickering
came
with
us
expressly
to
see
you
jasper
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
is
in
the
next
room
do
go
and
see
him
very
well
said
jasper
i
be
back
in
a
moment
or
two
father
going
out
pickering
dodge
still
lay
gazing
at
the
sprawling
flowers
on
the
wall
and
doing
his
best
not
to
count
them
the
door
opened
suddenly
well
well
old
fellow
jasper
came
up
to
the
bedside
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
running
in
every
little
while
it
good
to
see
you
again
pick
he
added
affectionately
laying
his
hand
that
good
right
hand
on
the
nervous
one
playing
with
the
coverlids
of
course
you
could
do
what
i
asked
jasper
no
one
could
said
pickering
rolling
over
to
look
at
him
and
i
was
a
fool
to
ask
it
but
i
might
have
been
kinder
said
jasper
compressing
his
lips
forget
that
pick
do
say
any
more
said
pickering
his
face
flushing
and
i
know
it
all
up
with
me
any
way
jasper
and
he
turned
pale
again
we
pulled
an
old
fellow
out
of
the
wreck
at
least
ben
did
the
most
of
it
polly
wanted
us
to
and
who
do
you
suppose
he
is
why
jack
loughead
uncle
of
course
be
here
soon
and
it
easy
to
see
the
end
at
that
pickering
bolted
up
in
bed
to
a
sitting
position
and
clutched
at
the
collar
of
his
morning
jacket
with
savage
fingers
do
pick
begged
jasper
in
an
unsteady
voice
i
going
to
get
up
declared
pickering
deliberately
clear
out
jasper
with
a
forbidding
gesture
or
i
pitch
into
you
you
lie
down
said
jasper
decidedly
there
get
in
again
with
a
gentle
push
on
pickering
long
legs
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
though
to
act
like
this
trying
to
speak
playfully
pickering
scrambled
back
into
bed
fuming
every
instant
to
lie
like
a
log
here
while
that
fellow
dashes
around
carrying
everything
before
him
it
it
abominable
and
atrocious
let
me
out
i
say
and
he
dashed
toward
the
edge
of
the
bed
nearly
knocking
jasper
over
hold
on
there
cried
jasper
pinning
down
the
clothes
with
a
firm
hand
do
you
see
while
pickering
struggled
to
toss
them
back
take
care
you
tear
this
quilt
that
i
help
you
on
to
your
feet
all
in
good
time
and
if
you
behave
yourself
you
be
around
and
a
match
for
any
jack
loughead
under
the
heavens
there
now
will
you
be
still
send
that
dunce
of
a
doctor
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
said
pickering
rolling
back
suddenly
once
more
into
the
hollow
made
in
the
center
of
the
dear
me
he
sweet
on
polly
too
he
groaned
under
the
clothes
whew
exclaimed
jasper
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
his
forehead
i
wo
agree
to
hold
you
in
bed
again
pick
i
send
the
doctor
he
added
going
out
but
you
see
that
you
do
lose
your
head
while
i
gone
i
promise
nothing
said
pickering
softly
to
himself
the
moment
the
door
closed
and
slipping
neatly
out
of
bed
he
tiptoed
over
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
there
snapping
his
fingers
in
the
air
as
if
i
have
that
idiot
of
a
doctor
around
me
then
he
proceeded
to
dress
himself
very
rapidly
but
with
painstaking
care
i
all
right
and
he
gave
himself
a
final
shake
that
doctor
would
have
made
a
fool
of
me
and
kept
me
in
bed
like
enough
for
a
week
and
with
that
jack
loughead
here
he
gave
a
swift
glance
into
the
cracked
hanging
over
the
high
shelf
and
with
another
pull
at
his
unlocked
the
door
and
went
out
halloo
oh
beg
pardon
a
long
figure
that
had
just
scaled
the
stairs
came
suddenly
up
against
pickering
stalking
along
the
narrow
hall
how
d
do
said
pickering
quite
jauntily
and
extending
the
tips
of
his
fingers
just
got
here
i
take
it
loughead
yes
returned
jack
loughead
pickering
was
made
no
more
steady
in
his
mind
nor
on
his
feet
by
seeing
the
other
evident
uneasiness
but
he
covered
it
up
by
a
careless
well
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
look
up
your
uncle
hey
yes
oh
yes
said
jack
of
course
my
uncle
well
were
any
of
the
others
hurt
yes
one
woman
was
killed
pickering
could
not
trust
himself
to
mention
polly
broken
arm
yet
jack
loughead
face
carried
the
proper
amount
of
sympathy
no
one
of
your
party
was
hurt
i
believe
he
said
quickly
oh
look
us
over
and
see
for
yourself
said
pickering
beginning
to
feel
faintish
and
as
if
he
would
like
to
sit
down
and
then
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
opened
and
out
came
all
the
others
and
the
doctor
who
was
saying
i
just
step
in
and
look
at
the
young
man
though
he
doing
well
enough
oh
my
gracious
thank
you
i
am
doing
well
enough
said
pickering
with
his
best
society
manner
on
and
extending
his
hand
much
obliged
i
sure
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
i
do
know
of
course
send
in
your
bill
and
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
make
it
all
right
jack
loughead
rushed
up
to
polly
no
one
told
me
is
your
arm
he
could
say
broken
being
quite
beyond
control
of
himself
how
are
you
mr
loughead
said
old
king
rather
stiffly
at
being
overlooked
and
putting
out
his
courtly
old
hand
oh
beg
pardon
jack
mumbled
something
about
being
an
awkward
fellow
at
the
best
and
extended
a
shaking
hand
you
are
anxious
to
see
your
uncle
of
course
continued
the
old
gentleman
leading
off
down
the
hall
this
way
mr
loughead
of
course
yes
indeed
stammered
jack
loughead
having
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
chapter
xiv
joel
joel
threw
down
his
books
in
an
uneasy
way
i
must
give
it
up
no
other
way
he
exclaimed
halloo
joe
you
here
cried
joel
whirling
in
surprise
come
out
of
your
hole
dave
peering
into
the
niche
between
the
and
the
bed
what
are
you
prowling
in
there
for
oh
my
rolled
in
here
somewhere
said
david
emerging
and
lifting
a
red
face
give
us
a
hand
joe
and
help
pull
out
the
bed
plague
on
this
room
for
being
such
a
box
there
with
an
impatient
shove
joel
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
then
stared
it
was
such
an
unusual
thing
to
see
a
frown
on
david
placid
face
what
come
over
you
any
way
stand
out
of
the
way
i
have
this
bed
over
there
in
a
jiffy
rolling
it
into
the
center
of
the
small
room
as
he
spoke
david
sprang
to
one
side
lightly
whew
what
a
dust
you
kick
up
he
cried
snapping
his
clothes
gingerly
so
you
are
in
your
best
toggery
exclaimed
joel
standing
straight
his
labors
over
the
bed
being
completed
yes
i
going
to
the
parrotts
to
dinner
said
david
hurrying
off
for
the
whisk
broom
to
remove
the
last
speck
of
dust
from
his
dress
suit
of
course
you
forgotten
it
joe
though
i
do
suppose
go
any
way
no
i
would
go
any
way
said
joel
tossing
back
his
black
locks
from
his
forehead
you
forget
dave
it
the
association
night
david
let
another
little
frown
settle
on
his
face
no
i
did
forget
that
joe
but
i
do
wish
you
think
it
possible
to
take
a
thursday
evening
off
once
in
a
while
for
the
sake
of
your
friends
if
for
no
other
reason
well
i
ca
said
joel
getting
down
on
to
hunt
for
the
button
so
do
let
go
over
old
arguments
where
in
time
is
that
thing
oh
and
he
came
up
bright
and
shining
to
his
feet
holding
the
button
between
his
thumb
and
finger
my
compliments
to
you
presenting
it
to
david
there
stick
it
in
before
it
gets
lost
again
and
hurry
off
you
look
pretty
as
a
pink
stop
your
nonsense
joe
cried
david
sharply
who
hated
being
reminded
of
his
girlish
beauty
well
i
make
the
usual
excuses
for
you
and
not
forgetting
to
pick
up
his
walking
stick
with
his
hat
he
ran
off
on
his
way
to
the
florist
for
the
that
must
go
on
before
he
presented
himself
at
the
parrotts
dinner
party
joel
shoved
back
the
bed
into
position
with
one
long
thrust
that
would
have
been
a
godsend
to
a
lagging
boat
crew
then
dashed
to
the
table
and
sat
down
doggedly
throwing
open
the
first
book
that
came
to
hand
i
rather
chop
wood
he
exclaimed
in
the
old
way
leaning
his
head
on
his
hands
whew
were
those
good
days
though
in
the
little
brown
house
when
we
had
all
outdoors
to
work
in
he
dropped
his
arms
to
pinch
the
muscles
of
one
with
his
other
fingers
is
that
beautiful
he
said
affectionately
then
he
swung
them
over
his
head
tilting
back
his
chair
restfully
what
did
mamsie
say
he
cried
bringing
the
chair
down
with
a
remorseful
thud
work
myself
to
skin
and
bone
but
i
go
through
creditably
here
goes
and
by
the
time
that
davie
was
handing
in
miss
lulu
parrott
to
dinner
joel
clapped
together
his
last
book
threw
on
his
hat
and
rushed
out
to
a
hasty
supper
at
commons
to
the
christian
association
meeting
little
perkins
ran
up
to
him
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
stop
a
bit
pepper
do
he
begged
johnson
gone
back
to
his
cups
and
we
do
anything
with
him
a
cloud
fell
over
joel
face
where
is
he
he
asked
oh
in
the
little
room
back
he
wo
show
his
face
here
and
yet
he
ca
keep
away
he
says
you
must
get
your
hand
on
him
pepper
and
little
perkins
hurried
off
joel
dashed
into
the
little
room
back
how
d
johnson
putting
out
his
hand
come
out
for
a
walk
do
why
this
room
is
stifling
i
ca
said
johnson
miserably
you
do
know
pepper
been
drinking
or
you
would
ask
me
nonsense
but
i
would
though
said
joel
sharply
come
out
i
say
johnson
it
enough
to
make
you
drink
again
to
stay
in
such
a
room
johnson
not
getting
out
of
his
chair
joel
went
in
and
laid
hold
of
his
arm
it
no
use
johnson
he
said
i
ca
talk
to
you
here
too
hot
and
close
and
i
do
want
a
walk
so
let
have
it
together
there
button
up
your
coat
as
they
were
well
out
in
the
hall
and
johnson
flung
his
hat
on
his
head
with
a
reckless
hand
as
they
hurried
down
the
steps
they
ran
against
a
crowd
of
college
boys
johnson
shrank
up
miserably
against
the
stone
fence
and
tried
to
look
as
small
as
possible
glances
of
recognition
passed
and
joel
spoke
to
right
and
left
as
the
boys
went
by
but
a
few
hisses
low
and
insistent
were
all
he
got
do
let
me
go
begged
johnson
still
hugging
the
fence
you
ca
save
me
and
they
hate
you
enough
for
such
work
come
on
roared
joel
at
him
and
plucking
him
off
from
the
fence
with
a
determined
hand
it
time
we
went
for
him
said
one
of
the
college
boys
with
a
backward
glance
at
joel
and
his
companion
the
deacon
is
absolutely
insulting
the
idea
of
his
speaking
to
us
let
have
it
over
said
another
what
do
you
say
to
the
others
where
davina
asked
another
oh
is
out
dining
said
the
first
voice
my
pretty
little
girl
is
safe
at
the
parrotts
sure
as
a
gun
met
him
with
a
posy
in
his
and
sweet
as
a
little
bud
himself
and
he
told
me
so
all
right
he
stay
away
late
then
the
parrotts
always
have
music
or
a
dance
after
their
dinners
come
on
the
last
speaker
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
boxed
imaginary
rounds
in
a
scientific
manner
in
the
air
agreed
the
tall
fellow
who
proposed
it
looked
over
the
whole
crew
do
you
all
want
to
have
it
done
as
they
came
to
a
standstill
on
the
pavement
yes
yes
hush
that
cop
is
looking
move
on
will
you
now
not
a
man
of
you
backs
out
you
understand
if
he
does
he
gets
worse
than
the
deacon
will
all
right
all
such
jolly
good
fellows
we
all
such
jolly
good
everybody
smiled
who
passed
them
singing
their
way
down
town
it
always
does
me
good
to
hear
those
students
sing
they
so
happy
and
so
affectionate
toward
each
other
said
one
lady
hanging
on
her
escort
arm
he
being
a
college
man
said
rapturously
oh
yes
joel
back
in
his
own
room
threw
himself
in
his
easy
chair
first
turning
down
the
gas
just
so
much
less
of
a
bill
for
grandpapa
our
debt
is
rolling
up
fast
enough
without
burning
up
the
money
dear
me
if
johnson
drinks
after
this
i
shall
be
in
despair
he
threw
up
his
long
legs
and
rested
them
on
the
mantel
while
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
think
the
better
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
called
joel
not
looking
around
till
a
rushing
sound
of
feet
trying
to
step
carefully
called
him
out
of
himself
now
now
two
or
three
swifter
than
the
others
darted
for
the
chair
but
joel
was
not
in
it
on
the
other
side
of
it
looking
at
them
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
he
stood
saying
what
do
you
want
oh
come
pepper
it
no
use
said
a
tall
fellow
wiry
and
agile
too
many
against
you
in
this
little
call
come
along
and
he
advanced
on
joel
you
come
along
yourself
dobbs
said
joel
pleasantly
and
holding
up
a
fist
that
looked
hard
to
begin
with
and
you
get
this
that
all
illustration
you
come
along
yourself
dobbs
said
joel
pleasantly
come
on
fellows
dobbs
looked
back
and
winked
to
the
others
now
there
was
a
rush
a
wild
tangle
of
arms
followed
by
a
wilder
tangle
of
legs
and
joel
was
through
the
ranks
his
black
eyes
blazing
and
tossing
his
black
hair
from
his
forehead
do
you
want
some
more
he
cried
flirting
his
fists
in
the
air
or
will
you
leave
my
room
lock
the
door
get
up
bingley
and
stop
your
roaring
no
give
it
to
you
now
and
no
mistake
if
you
wo
come
quietly
you
shall
some
way
deacon
these
were
some
of
the
smothered
cries
now
and
there
was
another
blind
rush
this
time
over
bingley
who
did
heed
the
invitation
to
get
up
joel
watching
his
chance
to
reach
the
door
had
no
time
before
they
were
on
him
and
he
heard
the
key
click
in
the
lock
it
for
mamsie
now
sure
and
for
polly
he
said
setting
his
teeth
hard
on
they
came
but
joel
in
rushing
through
as
before
was
so
mindful
of
stepping
over
bingley
carefully
that
it
lost
him
an
instant
and
a
grasp
firm
as
iron
was
on
his
arm
the
others
rallied
and
closed
around
him
unhand
me
yelled
joel
beating
them
off
but
he
might
as
well
have
fought
tigers
unless
he
could
knock
off
with
cruel
aim
the
one
hanging
to
his
arm
it
was
no
time
to
mince
matters
and
joel
only
careful
to
avoid
the
face
struck
a
terrible
blow
that
felled
dobbs
flat
now
will
you
go
roared
joel
aghast
at
what
he
had
done
yet
swinging
his
arms
with
deadly
intent
on
either
side
or
do
you
want
some
more
there
lay
two
valiant
fellows
on
the
floor
the
rest
drew
off
and
looked
at
them
you
pay
for
this
deacon
they
declared
under
their
breath
i
suppose
so
said
joel
still
swinging
his
arms
for
practice
probably
you
wait
for
me
with
kindly
intent
some
dark
night
behind
a
tree
as
you
know
i
do
carry
a
pistol
why
do
you
have
it
out
now
come
on
if
you
want
to
but
no
one
seemed
to
want
to
there
be
a
row
over
this
said
one
or
two
consulting
together
as
long
as
those
fellows
do
get
up
pointing
to
the
floor
we
must
wait
suddenly
the
door
was
unlocked
and
the
whole
crew
stampeded
see
here
cried
joel
bounding
after
them
come
back
and
take
care
of
your
two
men
but
the
crew
disappeared
bingley
lifted
his
head
feebly
just
like
dobbs
he
said
get
us
into
a
scrape
and
then
cut
hush
do
say
anything
said
joel
rushing
frantically
back
i
think
he
dead
oh
bingley
i
sorry
i
hurt
you
too
he
was
rapidly
pouring
water
into
the
basin
and
dashing
it
into
unconscious
face
i
must
go
for
the
doctor
he
groaned
bingley
he
ca
be
dead
do
say
he
is
in
a
flood
of
remorse
bingley
managed
to
roll
over
and
look
at
his
late
leader
he
looks
like
it
he
said
i
should
think
you
be
sorry
pepper
oh
groaned
joel
quite
and
dashing
the
water
with
a
reckless
hand
feeling
like
a
murderer
all
the
time
bingley
could
you
manage
to
do
this
at
last
he
cried
in
despair
i
must
run
for
a
doctor
there
not
a
minute
to
lose
i
would
go
for
any
doctor
advised
bingley
cautiously
see
his
eyelids
are
moving
this
row
will
be
all
over
town
if
you
do
but
joel
was
flying
off
come
back
called
bingley
i
vow
he
all
right
he
opened
his
eyes
pepper
joel
turned
saw
for
himself
that
dobbs
was
really
looking
at
him
and
that
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
what
is
it
dobbs
cried
joel
throwing
himself
down
on
his
knees
by
dobbs
side
let
him
alone
and
help
me
up
said
bingley
crossly
i
hurt
a
great
deal
more
he
tough
as
a
boiled
owl
give
us
a
hand
pepper
but
joel
had
his
ear
down
to
dobbs
mouth
where
are
the
fellows
asked
dobbs
in
a
whisper
gone
answered
joel
briefly
gone
and
left
me
here
like
a
dog
said
dobbs
yes
said
joel
they
could
wait
my
friend
observed
bingley
sarcastically
for
people
of
such
trifling
consequence
as
you
and
i
the
deuce
you
here
bingley
exclaimed
dobbs
in
his
natural
voice
and
trying
to
get
his
head
up
oh
you
are
coming
to
are
you
said
bingley
carelessly
well
dobbs
i
think
you
better
get
on
your
feet
and
help
me
out
since
pepper
wo
for
i
vow
i
ca
stir
oh
i
help
you
declared
joel
getting
up
to
run
over
and
put
his
hands
under
bingley
arms
paling
as
he
exclaimed
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
so
bingley
on
my
honor
i
did
and
you
did
said
bingley
wincing
with
the
pain
as
joel
slowly
drew
him
to
his
feet
it
was
your
stinger
of
a
blow
pepper
but
some
of
those
dastardly
cads
stepped
all
over
me
i
could
feel
them
hoofing
me
there
set
me
in
that
chair
and
i
draw
a
long
breath
if
i
can
now
i
shall
go
for
a
doctor
declared
joel
setting
bingley
within
the
and
making
a
second
dash
for
the
door
i
tell
you
you
will
not
cried
bingley
from
his
chair
wait
a
minute
till
i
see
where
i
hurt
i
coming
out
of
it
better
than
i
thought
come
back
pepper
really
joel
drew
off
from
the
door
and
looked
at
him
yes
go
and
take
care
of
dobbs
he
was
only
shamming
said
bingley
leaning
his
head
comfortably
on
the
dobbs
already
was
on
his
feet
and
slowly
standing
quite
straight
sure
you
do
want
any
help
asked
joel
putting
out
his
hand
thanks
no
said
dobbs
scornfully
not
looking
at
the
hand
but
making
for
the
door
let
him
alone
pepper
advised
bingley
a
mean
chap
like
that
is
hurt
you
could
kill
him
as
joel
looked
out
anxiously
to
watch
dobbs
progress
along
the
hall
at
last
following
him
along
a
bit
he
in
his
own
room
thank
fortune
exclaimed
joel
coming
back
and
i
suppose
i
ca
do
any
more
but
oh
i
do
wish
bingley
it
happened
joel
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
mantel
and
looked
down
at
the
and
its
occupant
perhaps
you
rather
be
lying
there
said
bingley
pointing
to
the
floor
instead
with
a
flopper
under
your
ear
like
the
nasty
one
you
gave
me
pepper
i
am
so
sorry
for
that
too
cried
joel
in
a
fresh
burst
of
remorse
i
got
no
more
i
presume
than
was
good
for
me
said
bingley
feeling
the
bump
under
his
ear
and
do
you
worry
pepper
for
your
mind
must
be
toned
up
to
meet
those
fellows
they
be
at
some
neat
little
game
to
pay
you
up
for
this
you
may
rest
assured
i
suppose
so
said
joel
indifferently
well
now
are
you
sure
i
do
anything
for
you
bingley
sure
as
a
gun
said
bingley
decidedly
i
getting
quite
limbered
out
so
i
go
for
i
know
my
room
is
better
than
my
company
pepper
and
he
dragged
himself
stiffly
out
of
his
chair
do
go
said
joel
hospitably
stay
as
long
as
you
want
to
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
bingley
turned
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
on
him
thank
you
he
said
but
davina
will
be
in
soon
and
things
will
have
to
be
explained
a
little
and
i
not
quite
up
to
it
no
i
must
go
moving
to
the
door
i
do
feel
like
making
a
pretty
speech
pepper
he
said
hesitating
a
bit
or
i
express
something
of
what
on
my
mind
but
i
think
you
understand
if
you
want
to
do
me
a
favor
said
joel
steadily
you
stop
calling
david
davina
it
makes
him
fearfully
mad
and
i
do
wonder
he
so
pretty
said
bingley
with
a
smile
and
wincing
at
the
same
time
we
ca
help
it
it
a
pity
to
spoil
that
lovely
name
but
you
must
declared
joel
growing
savage
i
tell
you
it
just
ruins
college
life
for
dave
and
he
so
bright
and
leads
his
class
i
do
see
how
you
can
oh
we
awfully
proud
of
him
said
bingley
leaning
heavily
on
the
table
of
course
and
trot
him
out
behind
his
back
for
praises
and
all
that
but
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
that
sweet
name
that
another
thing
he
added
regretfully
however
i
do
it
and
make
the
other
fellows
if
i
can
good
for
you
cried
joel
gratefully
bingley
sure
you
do
want
any
help
to
your
room
sure
declared
bingley
going
out
unsteadily
and
shutting
the
door
joel
threw
himself
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
the
and
burrowed
his
head
deep
within
it
oh
if
i
only
had
mamsie
lap
to
lay
it
in
he
groaned
and
mamsie
hands
to
go
over
it
joe
joe
david
flung
wide
the
door
where
are
you
he
cried
joel
sprang
to
his
feet
here
a
telegram
said
david
waving
a
yellow
sheet
at
him
i
just
met
the
boy
bringing
it
up
the
folks
were
going
to
see
jasper
on
a
surprise
party
something
happened
to
the
cars
and
polly
has
her
arm
broken
but
that
all
delivered
david
aghast
at
joel
face
polly
oh

polly
cried
joel
putting
up
both
hands
and
feeling
the
room
turn
around
with
him
yes
polly
said
david
do
look
so
joe
he
begged
feeling
his
own
cheeks
getting
white
it
only
broken
it
ca
be
bad
for
we
are
not
to
go
grandpapa
says

shaking
the
telegram
at
him
but
i
shall

we
both
must
declared
joel
passionately
beginning
to
rush
for
his
hat
behind
the
door
the
idea
polly
hurt
and
we
not
to
go
come
on
dave
we
can
catch
the
midnight
train
looking
at
his
watch
but
if
it
makes
polly
worse
said
david
doubtfully
joel
hand
carrying
the
hat
to
his
head
wavered
and
he
finally
tossed
the
into
the
nearest
corner
i
suppose
you
are
right
dave
he
said
helplessly
and
sinking
into
a
chair
chapter
xv
the
farmhouse
hospital
jack
loughead
marched
into
his
uncle
room
well
well
well
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
with
a
prolonged
look
and
sitting
straight
in
his
chair
so
this
really
is
you
jack
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
surprised
echoed
jack
getting
his
uncle
hands
in
both
of
his
why
uncle
i
cabled
crane
brothers
just
as
soon
as
i
got
your
letter
that
i
was
coming
this
is
the
first
thing
i
heard
of
it
said
old
loughead
well
how
did
you
track
me
here
for
goodness
sake
why
i
saw
an
account
of
your
accident
in
the
new
york
paper
as
soon
as
i
landed
said
jack
oh
confound
those
papers
exclaimed
his
uncle
ungratefully
well
i
came
near
being
done
for
jack
he
added
in
fact
i
was
left
in
the
wreck
jack
shuddered
but
that
little
girl
there
pointing
toward
the
next
room
where
the
talking
seemed
to
be
going
on
busily
insisted
that
i
was
buried
in
the
so
they
tell
me
and
she
made
them
come
and
look
for
me
none
too
soon
i
take
it
by
all
accounts
the
old
gentleman
placidly
tore
off
two
or
three
grapes
from
the
bunch
in
the
basketful
put
at
his
elbow
and
ate
them
leisurely
phronsie
is
a
good
child
said
jack
loughead
with
feeling
and
an
observing
one
too
phronsie
who
talking
of
phronsie
cried
his
uncle
pushing
back
the
it
was
the
other
one
polly
she
would
let
them
give
over
till
they
pulled
me
out
so
the
two
young
men
tell
me
very
chaps
too
they
are
jack
you
said
it
was
a
little
girl
jack
managed
to
remark
well
and
so
she
is
said
old
loughead
obstinately
and
a
nice
little
thing
too
i
should
say
miss
pepper
is
twenty
years
old
said
his
nephew
suddenly
then
he
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
nonsense
not
a
day
over
fifteen
contradicted
the
old
gentleman
flatly
and
i
must
say
jack
you
been
pretty
expert
considering
the
time
spent
in
this
house
in
taking
the
census
oh
i
knew
her
before
said
jack
angry
to
find
himself
stammering
over
what
ought
to
be
a
simple
account
enough
hem
hem
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
bestowing
a
keen
scrutiny
on
his
nephew
well
never
mind
he
said
at
last
now
let
to
business
are
you
strong
enough
asked
jack
in
duty
bound
yet
longing
to
get
the
talk
into
safe
business
channels
strong
enough
repeated
the
old
gentleman
in
a
dudgeon
i
really
better
than
i
was
before
the
i
going
home
tomorrow
i
have
you
to
know
jack
you
would
better
not
move
too
soon
said
his
nephew
involuntarily
then
he
added
hastily
at
least
take
the
doctor
advice
hem
hem
said
his
uncle
again
with
a
shrewd
smile
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
second
bunch
of
grapes
well
now
as
to
that
matter
you
sent
me
over
to
london
about
began
jack
nervously
plunging
into
business
draw
up
that
chair
and
put
your
mind
on
the
matter
and
we
go
over
it
interrupted
old
loughead
discarding
the
suddenly
and
assuming
his
commercial
expression
at
once
so
jack
drew
up
his
chair
as
bidden
and
presently
the
financial
head
of
the
bradbury
graeme
company
and
the
enterprising
young
member
who
was
the
principal
part
of
company
were
apparently
lost
to
all
else
in
the
world
but
their
own
concerns
meantime
pickering
dodge
was
having
a
truly
dreadful
time
of
it
the
doctor
washing
his
hands
of
such
a
troublesome
patient
had
just
run
downstairs
jumped
into
his
little
old
gig
in
displeasure
and
was
now
half
across
a
rut
worn
in
the
open
meadow
dignified
by
the
name
of
the
short
road
do
go
to
bed
implored
ben
studying

hoh
pickering
made

to
exclaim

pickering
in
high
disdain
as
if

put
myself
again
under
that
quack
thumb

and
snapping
his
fingers
derisively
at
ben
he
straightened
up
jauntily
on
his
somewhat
uncertain
feet
all
i
want
is
a
little
air
stumbling
off
to
the
window
well
i
going
to

johnny
as
they
disappeared
ben
ran
over
to
pickering
and
was
aghast
to
find
that
the
face
laid
against
the
was
deathly
white
and
that
all
his
shaking
of
the
broad
shoulders
could
not
make
pickering
open
his
eyes
jasper

all
out
of
breath
when
he
got
through

stood
looking
at
young
loughead
what
the
doctor
wanted
for
cried

to
his
feet
and
seizing
his
hat
from

jack
loughead
after

suddenly
as

horribly
lonesome

his
chair
that

ben
and
i

with
regret

commanded
the
old
gentleman
imperatively
and

then
i

and
he
began
to
chuckle
with
pleasure
so
ben
ran
off
and
presently
polly
her
arm
in
a
sling
came
hurrying
in
bless
my
soul
cried
the
old
gentleman
if
your
cheeks
are
as
rosy
as
if
you
had
two
good
arms
and
this
was
an
sort
of
excursion
for
pleasure
illustration
so
nice
everybody
is
getting
on
so
well
said
polly
it
so
nice
said
polly
sitting
down
on
one
of
ottomans
on
which
that
lady
had
worked
a
remarkable
cat
in
blue
worsted
reposing
on
a
bit
of
green
sward
to
think
that
everybody
is
getting
on
so
well
and
she
hugged
her
lame
arm
rapturously
hem
hem
i
should
say
so
breathed
old
loughead
regarding
her
closely
where
have
they
buried
that
woman
he
demanded
suddenly
polly
started
out
in
the
meadow
she
said
softly
higby
wanted
it
here
instead
of
in
the
churchyard
it
is
under
a
beautiful
loughead
and
higby
is
going
to
make
a
fence
around
it
and
grandpapa
is
to
put
up
the
stone
i
suppose
you
mean
interrupted
the
old
gentleman
well
and
when
that
done
why
what
can
be
said
upon
it
pray
tell
you
do
know
a
thing
about
it
who
in
christendom
the
woman
was
not
a
thing
johnny
mother
said
polly
sorrowfully
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooping
that
going
to
be
on
it
and
grandpapa
is
to
have
the
letters
cut
telling
about
the
accident
and
higby
hopes
that
sometime
somebody
will
come
to
inquire
about
it
but
i
do
believe
anybody
ever
will
come
in
all
this
world
added
polly
softly
because
there
is
no
one
left
who
belongs
to
johnny
and
she
told
the
story
the
pale
little
mother
had
just
finished
when
the
car
went
over
old
loughead
hemmed
and
exclaimed
impatiently
and
fidgeted
in
his
chair
all
through
the
recital
when
it
was
over
and
polly
sat
quite
still
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
horrible
boy
he
asked
sharply
almshouse

declared
polly
in
horror
phronsie

going
to
take
him
into
the
home
phronsie

in
disgust

are
talking
of
i
shall
speak
to
mr
king
johnny
is
just
a
dear
cried
polly
having
great
difficulty
not
to
spring
from
her
chair
and
turn
her
back
on
the
old
gentleman
then
and
there
but
into
your
home
repeated
old
loughead
his
disgust
gaining
on
him
with
each
word
it
monstrous
it
oh
i
did
mean
our
home
explained
polly
obliged
to
interrupt
him
he
was
becoming
so
furious
johnny
is
going
down
to
dunraven
to
the
children
home
and
then
she
began
on
the
story
of
phronsie
company
of
children
and
how
they
lived
and
who
they
were
with
many
little
side
stories
of
this
small
creature
who
was
too
cunning
for
anything
and
that
funny
little
boy
till
the
old
gentleman
sat
helplessly
listening
in
abject
silence
and
the
latch
was
lifted
and
young
loughead
put
his
head
in
the
doorway
looking
as
if
he
had
finished
a
long
tramp
come
in
jack
said
his
uncle
finding
his
tongue
we
a
whole
orphan
asylum
in
here
and
i
do

what
all
every
charity

and
see
if
you
can
make
head
or
tail
to
it
oh
loughead
knows
all
about
it
cried
polly
brightly
while
her
cheeks
glowed
for
he
went
down
to
dunraven
with
us
at
christmas
and
he
showed
the
children
stereopticon
pictures
and
told
them
such
nice
stories
of
places
that
he
had
seen
he
my
jack
exploded
the
old
gentleman
starting
forward
and
pointing
to
his
nephew
great
caesar
he
never
did
such
a
thing
in
his
life
ah
said
polly
shaking
her
brown
head
while
she
looked
only
at
the
old
gentleman
you
ought
to
have
seen
sir
how
happy
the
children
were
that
day
my
jack
went
to
an
orphan
asylum
to
show
pictures
to
the
children
reiterated
the
old
gentleman
unable
to
grasp
another
idea
do
be
still
uncle
begged
his
tall
nephew
jogging
his
elbow
here
here
polly
cried
jasper
voice
and
at
the
same
moment
in
sped
little
fisher
his
glasses
shining
with
determination
as
he
gazed
all
over
the
room
for
polly
my
dear
dear
child
he
cried
as
he
spied
her
and
papa
fisher
joyfully
from
polly
as
she
sprang
from
ottoman
and
precipitated
herself
into
the
little
doctor
arms
softly
softly
child
he
warned
you
hurt
it
tenderly
covering
the
poor
arm
with
his
right
hand
while
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
with
the
other
for
his
handkerchief
dear
me
and
he
blew
his
nose
violently
yes
well
you
sure

all
right
except
this
and
he
held
polly
at
arm
length
and
scanned
her
closely
i
am
all
right
if
you
will
only
tell
me
that
mamsie
is
well
and
worried
about
us
said
polly
an
anxious
little
pucker
coming
on
her
forehead
your
mother
is
as
bright
as
a
button
declared
father
fisher
emphatically
come
come
ejaculated
king
appearing
in
the
doorway
this
just
the
way
to
take
possession
of
loughead
apartment
jasper
i
do
see
what
you
were
thinking
of
come
fisher
my
room
is
next
this
way
polly
blushed
red
as
a
rose
as
old
loughead
said
briskly
oh
i
sent
for
her
to
cheer
me
up
and
now
i
wish
you
all
stay
beg
pardon
for
this
inroad
said
little
doctor
fisher
going
up
to
the
old
gentleman
chair
and
offering
his
hand
well
well
loughead
to
jack
this
is
a
surprise
party
all
round
no
inroad
at
all
at
least
a
pleasant
one
old
loughead
kept
saying
while
polly
ran
up
to
jasper
did
pickering
uncle
come
with
papa
fisher
no
said
jasper
with
his
eyes
on
jack
loughead
the
doctor
was
all
alone
polly
and
then
the
door
of
pickering
room
opened
and
out
came
bryce
with
bad
news
written
all
over
his
face
i
fear
brain
fever
he
said
to
fisher
after
the
introduction
was
over
making
the
two
physicians
acquainted
come
and
the
door
of
pickering
room
closed
on
them
both
and
twilight
settled
down
on
the
old
square
white
house
and
on
the
grave
under
the
oak
in
the
meadow
and
brierly
people
by
twos
and
threes
came
to
inquire
for
the
sick
young
man
going
away
with
saddened
faces
and
a
messenger
from
the
telegraph
office
drove
up
just
as
higby
was
pulling
on
the
boots
to
his
tired
feet
for
a
long
walk
to
the
village
handing
in
the
message
cabot
and
i
will
take
the
midnight
train
richard
cabot
illustration
then
phronsie
glanced
back
again
and
softly
jogged
the
cradle
and
then
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
only
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
pickering
uncle
and
aunt
and
the
next
day
pickering
calls
were
incessant
for
polly
polly
sometimes
upbraiding
her
as
the
brown
eyes
were
fastened
piteously
on
his
wild
face
and
then
begging
her
to
just
smile
at
him
and
remember
how
he
had
loved
her
all
these
years
and
now
i
am
going
to
die
he
would
cry
o
polly
polly
cabot
would
wring
her
hands
and
beg
at
such
times
a
world
of
entreaty
in
her
voice
and
then
old
king
would
interfere
carrying
polly
off
and
declaring
it
was
beyond
all
reason
for
her
to
be
so
annoyed
and
phronsie
would
climb
up
on
the
bed
and
lay
her
cool
little
hand
gently
on
the
hot
forehead
then
the
sick
boy
cries
would
drop
into
unintelligible
murmurs
while
his
fingers
picked
aimlessly
at
the
coverlet
there
he
is
better
phronsie
would
say
softly
to
the
watchers
by
the
bed
and
i
guess
he
is
going
to
sleep
but
the
quiet
only
ushered
in
worse
ravings
when
pickering
lived
over
once
more
the
horror
of
the
and
then
it
took
many
strong
arms
to
hold
him
in
his
bed
come
on
ben
he
would
shout
struggling
hard
leave
him
alone
we
shall
be
caught
the
fire
the
fire
until
his
strength
died
away
and
he
sank
to
a
deathly
stupor
phronsie
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
to
fargo
one
like
it
was
dropped
every
morning
into
the
basket
set
on
higby
front
entry
table
ready
for
the
neighbor
boy
to
take
to
the
village
dear
fargo
wrote
phronsie
looking
off
from
the
wooden
cradle
that
higby
had
dragged
down
from
its
cobwebby
corner
under
the
garret
eaves
with
the
remark
i
guess
johnny
sleep
well
all
the
higbys
since
the
first
one
has
been
rocked
in
it
i
must
tell
you
that
dear
pickering
any
better
then
she
glanced
back
again
and
softly
jogged
the
cradle
as
johnny
turned
over
with
a
long
sigh
and
papa
fisher
and
the
other
doctor
do
think
he
is
going
to
get
well
and
cabot
cries
all
the
time
and
polly
cries
sometimes
too
and
we
do
know
what
to
do
but
i
guess
god
will
take
care
of
us
and
charlotte
is
going
to
take
johnny
down
to
the
dunraven
home
in
a
day
or
two
she
says
she
can
though
i
know
she
do
like
babies
especially
she
said
so
once
and
so
he
will
be
happy
and
that
all
i
can
write
fargo
because
every
minute
i
afraid
polly
will
want
me
from
phronsie
and
just
the
very
minute
when
phronsie
was
dotting
the
i
in
her
name
higby
came
toiling
up
the
stairs
holding
her
gingham
gown
well
away
from
her
feet
say
she
cried
in
a
loud
whisper
and
pausing
midway
to
wave
a
large
square
envelope
at
phronsie
curled
up
on
the
hall
phronsie
got
down
very
softly
and
tiptoed
over
to
the
to
grasp
the
letter
higby
thrust
between
the
bars
going
back
to
her
old
post
to
open
it
carefully
dear
phronsie
i
think
god
meant
that
i
was
to
have
johnny
for
my
very
own
so
you
give
him
to
me
dear
let
charlotte

will
give
him

chapter

on
the
borderland
phronsie
came
into
the
higby
kitchen
her
hands
full
of
and
nodding
trilliums
pickering
will
like
these
she
said
to
herself
in
great
satisfaction
and
surveying
her
torn
frock
with
composure
for
they
are
the
very
first
higby
addressing
that
individual
standing
over
by
the
sink
in
the
corner
please
may
i
wash
my
hands
i
had
to
go
clear
far
down
by
the
brook
to
get
them
but
higby
instead
of
answering
threw
her
apron
high
over
her
head
phronsie
stood
quite
still
why
do
you
put
your
apron
there
mrs
higby
she
asked
at
last
and
you
do
not
answer
me
at
all
she
added
in
gentle
reproach
land
exclaimed
higby
in
a
voice
spent
with
feeling
i
could
i
was
afraid
i
sh
burst
out
crying
and
i
did
want
you
to
see
my
face
o

he
had
a
poor
spell
since
you
went
out
flowerin
for
him
and
your
pa
and
bryce
say
he
dyin
o
dear
down
came
the
apron
showing
higby
eyelids
very
red
and
swollen
phronsie
still
stood
holding
her
flowers
a
then
turned
and
went
quickly
to
the
back
stairs
sh
do

called
higby
in
a
loud
whisper
after
her
dreadful
for
a
little
girl
like
you
to
see
any
one
die
do
come
back
they
will
want
me
said
phronsie
gravely
and
going
up
carefully
without
another
word
when
she
reached
pickering
door
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
in
i
do
believe
it
is
as
higby
said
she
thought
drawing
a
long
breath
a
faint
smile
coming
to
her
face
as
she
went
gently
in
but
old
king
put
up
his
hand
as
he
turned
in
his
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
phronsie
saw
that
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
and
bryce
turned
also
looking
off
a
minute
from
the
watch
that
he
held
as
if
he
were
going
to
bid
her
go
away
illustration
why
do
you
put
your
apron
up
there
asked
phronsie
in
gentle
reproach
phronsie
said
grandpapa
holding
out
both
arms
hungrily
phronsie
hurried
to
him
a
gathering
fear
at
her
heart
and
getting
into
his
lap
laid
her
cheek
against
his
oh
my
dear
you
ought
to
be
here
you
are
too
young
said
king
brokenly
yet
holding
her
close
i
am
not
afraid
grandpapa
said
phronsie
her
mouth
to
his
ear
and
i
think
pickering
would
like
me
to
be
here
i
brought
him
some
flowers
she
moved
the
hand
holding
the
bunch
so
that
the
old
gentleman
could
see
it
he
likes
wild
flowers
and
i
promised
to
get
the
first
ones
i
could
o
dear
groaned
old
king
not
trusting
himself
to
look
may
i
lay
them
down
by
him
whispered
phronsie
yes
yes
child
said
the
old
gentleman
allowing
her
to
slip
to
the
floor
the
group
around
the
bedside
parted
to
let
her
pass
and
then
phronsie
saw
polly
cabot
was
holding
polly
well
hand
while
her
head
was
on
polly
shoulder
grandpapa
said
i
might
said
phronsie
softly
to
the
two
and
pointing
to
her
flowers
yes
dear
it
was
polly
who
answered
cabot
was
crying
so
hard
she
could
not
speak
a
word
phronsie
little
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
as
she
reached
the
bedside
she
had
not
thought
that
she
would
be
afraid
but
it
was
so
different
to
be
standing
there
looking
down
upon
the
pillow
where
pickering
lay
so
still
and
white
and
with
closed
eyes
looking
as
if
he
had
already
gone
away
from
them
she
glanced
up
in
a
startled
way
and
saw
fisher
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
was
holding
pickering
wrist
yes
he
motioned
put
them
down
so
phronsie
laid
down
her
blossoms
near
the
poor
white
face
and
stole
back
quickly
only
breathing
freely
when
she
was
as
close
to
polly
as
she
could
creep
without
hurting
the
broken
arm
i
dying
i
not
afraid
suddenly
said
pickering
white
lips
fisher
sprang
and
put
a
spoonful
of
stimulant
to
them
while
cabot
buried
her
face
yet
deeper
on
polly
shoulder
her
husband
turning
on
his
heel
to
pace
the
floor
and
groan
polly
polly
called
pickering
quite
distinctly
in
a
tone
of
anguish
o
polly
polly
he
dying
go
to
him
do
cabot
tore
her
hand
out
of
polly
almost
pushing
her
from
the
chair
quick
dear
polly
put
phronsie
aside
and
stepped
softly
to
the
bedside
eyes
eagerly
watched
for
her
face
he
smiled
up
at
her
polly
and
tried
to
raise
his
hand
she
laid
her
warm
soft
palm
on
the
cold
one
lying
on
the
coverlid
he
clasped
his
thin
fingers
convulsively
around
it
i
am
here
pickering
said
polly
unable
to
find
voice
for
anything
else
do
ever
leave
me
she
could
just
make
out
the
words
bending
close
to
catch
them
i
never
will
said
polly
quietly
a
sudden
gleam
came
into
his
face
and
he
tried
to
smile
grasping
her
hand
tighter
as
his
eyes
closed
it
has
come
said
fisher
in
a
low
voice
to
cabot
tell
your
wife
and
he
bent
a
professional
ear
over
the
white
face
on
the
pillow
while
bryce
hurried
forward
then
brought
his
head
up
quickly
a
peculiar
light
in
the
sharp
eyes
back
of
the
spectacles
he
is
sleeping
polly
was
sitting
a
by
the
bedside
pickering
thin
fingers
still
tightly
grasping
her
hand
they
had
made
her
comfortable
in
an
easy
chair
jasper
bringing
one
of
higby
biggest
cushions
for
her
to
lean
her
head
against
he
now
stood
at
the
side
of
her
chair
phronsie
curled
up
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
do
stay
polly
lips
seemed
to
frame
the
words
rather
than
speak
them
looking
up
at
him
he
shook
his
head
resting
his
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
polly
tried
to
smile
up
a
bit
of
comfort
into
his
eyes
jasper
loved
pickering
so
she
said
to
herself
that
he
can
not
leave
him
but
oh
he
looks
so
dreadfully
i
wish
he
would
go
and
rest
and
she
began
to
have
a
worried
look
at
once
what
is
it
asked
jasper
catching
the
look
at
once
and
bending
to
whisper
in
her
ear
you
will
be
sick
if
you
do
not
go
and
rest
whispered
back
polly
i
can
not
do
ask
it
jasper
brought
the
words
out
sharply
with
just
a
bitter
tone
to
them
he
thinks
it
is
strange
that
i
ask
it
he
is
so
fond
of
pickering
said
polly
to
herself
and
now
i
have
grieved
him
o
dear
i
wo
leave
pickering
she
said
lifting
her
brown
eyes
quickly
a
spasm
came
over
jasper
face
and
his
brow
contracted
do
he
begged
and
polly
could
feel
that
the
hand
resting
on
the
back
of
the
chair
grasped
it
so
tightly
that
it
shook
beneath
her
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
jasper
could
leave
him
he
loves
him
so
mourned
polly
oh
why
did
i
speak
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
cabot
was
excitedly
walking
the
floor
twisting
her
handkerchief
between
her
nervous
fingers
and
talking
unrestrainedly
to
charlotte
chatterton
i
do
believe
this
will
melt
polly
heart
she
cried
oh
it
must
it
must
do
you
think
it
must
miss
chatterton
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
charlotte
chatterton
in
a
collected
manner
as
she
bent
over
the
cradle
to
tuck
the
shawl
over
johnny
legs
where
he
had
kicked
it
off
in
his
sleep
oh
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
miss
chatterton
declared
cabot
in
her
distress
losing
her
habitually
polite
manner
why
everybody
knows
that
pickering
has
loved
polly
since
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
not
knowing
what
was
expected
of
her
charlotte
chatterton
wisely
kept
silent
and
now
why
it
just
a
providence
i
do
believe
that
is
if
he
gets
well
that
brought
all
this
about
for
of
course
polly
must
be
touched
by
it
she
must
brought
up
cabot
quite
jubilantly
and
this
time
she
waited
for
charlotte
to
speak
at
last
exclaiming
do
you
see
it
must
be
so
i
think
love
goes
where
it
is
sent
said
charlotte
slowly
sent
well
that
is
just
it
is
it
sent
here
cried
cabot
impatiently
i
do
know
said
charlotte
then
she
said
distinctly
i
know
love
is
very
different
from
pity
of
course
it
is
but
then
sometimes
it
is
said
cabot
nervously
well
any
way
polly
has
almost
as
good
as
promised
to
marry
pickering
she
finished
triumphantly
so
and
you
are
very
cruel
to
talk
to
me
in
this
way
miss
chatterton
charlotte
chatterton
turned
away
from
johnny
and
faced
cabot
you
do
mean
to
say
you
think
polly
would
feel
bound
by
what
she
said
when
we
all
thought
he
was
dying
i
do
certainly
knowing
polly
as
i
do
if
pickering
took
it
so
and
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
say
so
when
he
gets
well
quite
sure
polly
a
girl
to
break
her
word
added
cabot
confidently
then
i
sure
providence
has
had
anything
to
do
with
this
said
charlotte
shortly
and
polly
shall
never
be
tormented
into
thinking
it
her
duty
either
and
she
turned
off
to
pick
up
a
new
gown
in
the
works
for
johnny
what
you
think
duty
miss
chatterton
would
be
polly
pepper
idea
of
duty
in
the
least
said
cabot
getting
back
into
the
refuge
of
her
society
manner
again
now
that
her
confidence
in
polly
grew
every
moment
so
we
will
talk
no
more
about
it
if
you
please
she
added
icily
as
she
went
toward
the
door
only
mark
my
words
my
dear
boy
and
that
dear
girl
will
be
engaged
and
quite
the
appropriate
match
it
will
be
too
and
please
every
one
you
must
go
back
my
boy
said
old
king
two
days
later
it
just
knocking
you
up
to
stay
studying
jasper
face
keenly
goodness
me
i
should
think
you
fallen
off
a
dozen
pounds
upon
my
word
i
should
my
boy
he
repeated
with
great
concern
never
mind
me
father
said
jasper
a
trifle
impatiently
and
as
to
my
work
marlowe
will
give
me
a
few
more
days
he
goodness
itself
i
shall
telegraph
him
this
morning
for
an
extension
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
declared
king
testily
what
can
you
do
here
pray
tell
by
staying
you
would
be
quite
a
muff
in
a
few
more
days
jasper
he
added
you
are
so
now
no
i
insist
that
you
go
now
very
well
said
jasper
quite
stiffly
i
will
take
myself
off
by
the
afternoon
train
then
father
since
i
am
in
the
way
how
you
talk
jasper
cried
his
father
in
astonishment
you
know
quite
well
that
i
am
only
thinking
of
your
own
good
what
got
into
you
but
i
suppose
this
confounded
hospital
we
in
has
made
you
lose
your
head
thank
you
father
said
jasper
recovering
himself
by
a
great
effort
for
putting
it
so
and
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
for
my
hasty
words
he
came
up
to
the
old
gentleman
and
put
out
his
hand
quickly
do
forgive
me
father
forgive
you
of
course
i
will
though
i
do
know
when
you
spoken
to
me
like
that
jasper
said
his
father
not
yet
able
to
shake
himself
free
from
his
bewilderment
well
well
that
enough
to
say
about
that
seeing
jasper
face
and
now
get
back
to
your
work
my
boy
as
soon
as
you
can
and
you
thank
me
for
sending
you
off
and
as
soon
as
pickering
dodge
is
able
to
be
moved
home
why
the
rest
of
us
will
finish
our
trip
and
give
you
that
surprise
party
eh
jasper
and
king
tried
to
laugh
in
the
old
way
but
it
was
pretty
hard
work
well
now
polly
said
fisher
a
week
after
as
he
held
her
at
arm
length
and
brought
his
spectacles
to
bear
upon
her
face
remember
what
i
say
child
you
are
to
take
care
of
yourself
and
let
cabot
look
out
for
things
it
will
do
the
woman
good
to
have
something
to
do
he
added
dropping
his
voice
i
do
like
to
carry
home
your
face
child
it
wo
do
you
getting
tired
out
and
your
mother
will
be
sure
to
find
it
out
i
really
ought
to
stay
and
take
care
of
you
and
the
little
doctor
began
to
look
troubled
at
once
indeed
papa
fisher
cried
polly
brightening
up
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
why
my
arm
is
doing
famously
you
know
you
said
you
never
saw
a
broken
arm
behave
so
well
in
all
your
life
it
is
your
arm
polly
that
worries
me
said
father
fisher
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
turned
out
better
perhaps
for
breaking
but
it
something
different
and
it
quite
puzzles
me
you
look
so
child
do
i
said
polly
standing
quite
straight
and
rubbing
her
forehead
with
her
well
hand
there
now
i
will
get
the
puckers
and
wrinkles
out
there
papa
fisher
are
they
all
gone
she
smiled
as
cheerily
as
ever
but
the
little
man
shook
his
head
then
took
off
his
spectacles
wiped
them
and
set
them
back
on
his
nose
no
it
wo
do
you
ca
make
your
old
father
believe
but
what
something
on
your
mind
polly
i
think
i
shall
have
to
send
your
mother
down
here
he
said
suddenly
o
father
fisher
cried
polly
the
color
flying
over
her
face
you
would
ever
do
that
i
am
sure
why
it
would
worry
mamsie
so
and
besides
she
ca
leave
king
fisher
he
interrupted
her
as
she
clung
to
his
arm
i
know
that
but
what
can
i
do
if
you
only
promise
now
polly
he
added
artfully
that
you
wo
tire
yourself
all
out
trying
to
suit
cabot
whims
why
think
about
taking
back
what
i
said
about
sending
your
mother
down
oh
i
wo
i
wo
promised
polly
gladly
and
now
dear
papa
fisher
you
take
it
all
back
wo
you
she
begged
yes
said
fisher
glad
to
see
polly
color
back
again
and
to
have
her
beg
him
for
some
favor
so
the
next
or
so
they
were
very
cheery
just
like
old
times
just
as
if
there
had
been
no
sickness
and
the
shadow
of
a
loss
upon
them
in
the
past
days
though
why
we
should
be
always
acting
as
if
we
were
in
the
midst
of
it
now
i
do
see
said
the
little
doctor
at
last
we
all
straightened
out
thank
god
and
pickering
mending
so
fast
that
he
a
perfect
marvel
it
would
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
us
to
be
in
the
dumps
forever
well
now
polly
remember
whew
hear
that
youngster
this
last
being
brought
out
by
johnny
lusty
shouts
in
the
next
room
i
do
envy
fargo
her
bargain
and
i
do
pity
myself
having
to
see
him
safely
there
oh
charlotte
will
take
all
the
care
of
him
said
polly
quickly
she
just
beautiful
with
him
you
do
know
how
beautiful
papa
fisher
because
you
been
so
busy
since
you
been
here
and
charlotte
has
kept
him
away
from
everybody
so
he
need
worry
any
one
and
is
it
lovely
that
he
is
to
have
such
a
beautiful
home
added
polly
with
shining
eyes
um
yes
for
johnny
said
fisher
well
polly
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
for
a
final
kiss
oh
here
charlotte
come
to
bid
you
too
polly
said
charlotte
drawing
her
off
to
a
quiet
corner
as
the
little
doctor
went
away
leaving
the
two
girls
together
i
must
say
something
and
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
polly
looked
at
her
with
wide
eyes
it
just
this
said
charlotte
plunging
on
desperately
polly
let
cabot
pick
at
you
and
talk
about
duty
oh
i
hate
to
hear
her
speak
the
word
exploded
charlotte
with
a
volume
of
wrath
in
her
tone
what
do
you
mean
charlotte
cried
polly
in
a
puzzled
way
oh
she
may
never
mind
how
she
quite
peculiar
you
know
said
charlotte
finding
her
way
less
clear
with
each
word
never
mind
polly
only
just
fight
her
if
she
begins
on
what
is
your
duty
if
she
does
then
fight
her
tooth
and
nail
but
it
may
be
something
that
i
really
ought
to
do
said
polly
charlotte
turned
on
her
in
horror
o
never
she
cried
do
you
do
it
polly
pepper
just
as
sure
as
she
says
you
ought
to
do
it
you
may
know
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
in
all
the
world
promise
me
polly
that
you
wo
do
it
but
charlotte
i
ought
not
to
promise
until
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
would
be
my
duty
to
do
what
cabot
advises
do
you
see
charlotte
that
i
ought
not
to
promise
but
charlotte
was
too
far
gone
in
anxiety
to
see
anything
and
she
could
only
reiterate
do
promise
polly
do
there
higby
calling
us
the
carriage
is
at
the
door
do
polly
i
never
will
ask
you
anything
else
if
you
only
promise
me
this
but
polly
could
only
shake
her
head
and
say
i
ought
not
and
then
johnny
had
to
be
kissed
and
wrenched
from
phronsie
who
insisted
on
carrying
him
downstairs
to
set
him
in
the
carriage
and
cabot
came
in
and
old
king
wanted
a
last
word
with
charlotte
so
that
at
last
she
was
in
higby
carryall
shut
in
on
the
back
seat
looking
out
over
johnny
head
with
a
pair
of
very
hopeless
eyes
but
her
lips
said
do
polly
and
still
polly
on
the
flat
had
to
shake
her
head
i
shall
tell
fisher
and
beg
her
to
come
right
down
here
determined
charlotte
chatterton
to
herself
just
as
soon
as
i
get
in
the
house
that
is
exactly
what
i
shall
do
she
declared
savagely
as
higby
whipped
up
the
mare
for
the
drive
to
the
little
station
chapter
xvii
jasper
halloo
king
marlowe
wants
you
jasper
his
hands
full
of
papers
hurried
down
the
long
warehouse
through
the
piles
of
books
fresh
from
the
bindery
stacked
closely
to
the
ceiling
the
busy
packers
who
were
filling
the
boxes
looked
up
as
he
threaded
his
way
between
them
marlowe
is
down
there
indicating
the
direction
with
a
nod
while
the
hands
kept
mechanically
at
their
task
i
want
to
see
you
about
that
last
lot
of
paper
marlowe
began
before
jasper
had
reached
him
it
is
thin
and
of
poorer
quality
than
i
ordered
the
loss
must
be
charged
back
to
withers
is
that
so
exclaimed
jasper
they
assured
me
that
everything
should
be
right
and
like
the
sample
that
we
ordered
it
from
and
jacob
bendel
writes
that
the
edition
we
gave
him
of
of
great
to
print
will
be
shipped
to
us
within
a
fortnight
when
his
contract
was
to
be
filled
on
thursday
of
course
we
lose
all
the
chicago
orders
by
this
delay
what
the
reason
asked
jasper
feeling
all
the
thrill
of
the
disappointment
as
keenly
as
if
he
were
the
head
of
the
house
oh
a
strike
among
the
printers
his
best
men
have
gone
out
and
at
the
mercy
of
a
lot
of
inferior
workmen
who
are
being
intimidated
by
the
strikers
but
he
thinks
he
can
get
the
edition
to
us
in
ten
days
or
so
marlowe
leaned
against
an
empty
packing
case
and
viewed
the
assistant
foreman
of
the
manufacturing
department
calmly
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
disappointments
were
in
the
usual
order
of
things
ca
we
give
it
to
another
printer
asked
jasper
who
morse
brothers
they
are
full
and
running
over
with
work
i
inquired
there
yesterday
we
may
want
a
little
extra
done
as
the
rush
over
those
primary
readers
is
coming
on
no
i
ca
think
of
a
place
where
we
could
crowd
it
in
if
we
took
it
away
from
bendel
jasper
gaze
thoughtfully
followed
the
drift
of
a
shaving
blown
by
the
draft
along
the
warehouse
floor
i
think
i
send
you
down
to
new
york
to
see
bendel
and
find
out
how
things
are
i
do
get
any
satisfaction
from
letters
said
marlowe
in
a
minute
beside
you
can
attend
to
some
other
matters
and
then
there
is
that
troy
job
you
can
do
that
very
well
sir
can
you
take
the
night
express
marlowe
pulled
out
his
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
of
three
can
i
leave
the
ransom
bills
i
was
checking
off
parker
said
they
were
the
most
important
of
the
lot
parker
must
give
them
to
richard
he
knows
pretty
well
how
to
do
them
unless
he
can
find
time
for
them
himself
i
was
to
be
at
the
green
at
nine
morning
said
jasper
what
for
they
sent
down
to
parker
yesterday
that
we
had
made
a
mistake
about
price
for
doing
those
five
hundred
and
and
wanted
him
to
go
to
their
office
and
see
green
himself
if
green
thinks
any
mistake
has
been
made
let
him
come
to
us
said
marlowe
coolly
you
tell
parker
to
send
a
note
to
that
effect
courteously
written
of
course
but
to
the
point
we
do
go
running
around
after
people
who
think
mistakes
are
made
let
them
bring
their
grievances
here
if
they
have
any
is
that
all
that
detains
you
jasper
held
out
his
hand
full
of
papers
these
were
to
come
in
between
when
they
could
sir
hem
hem
marlowe
read
them
over
with
a
practiced
eye
rolled
them
up
and
handed
the
roll
to
jasper
tell
parker
to
set
danforth
on
those
anything
more
i
was
to
go
if
there
was
time
to
get
prices
for
best
calendered
paper
of
patterson
and
withers
but
the
next
day
will
do
parker
must
attend
to
all
that
said
marlowe
decidedly
very
well
sir
i
believe
that
is
all
that
hurries
particularly
come
this
way
i
give
you
instructions
what
to
say
to
bendel
and
marlowe
led
the
way
out
to
a
quiet
corner
of
the
warehouse
where
he
sat
down
by
a
desk
and
rapidly
laid
the
points
of
the
business
before
his
assistant
the
next
morning
in
new
york
jasper
ran
across
whitney
on
broadway
well
said
that
you
jasper
why
are
you
up
at
the
house
i
came
on
the
night
express
said
jasper
finding
it
hard
to
wait
a
minute
on
a
matter
of
importance
for
marlowe
sorry
brother
mason
but
i
ca
stop
now
you
be
up
of
course
said
mason
whitney
i
ca
i
off
for
troy
said
jasper
concisely
and
i
do
come
back
this
way
goodness
what
a
man
your
marlowe
is
and
your
sister
marian
wants
to
hear
about
polly
and
all
the
others
you
seen
them
so
lately
it
impossible
began
jasper
you
see
i
ca
help
it
brother
mason
marlowe
orders
must
be
carried
out
he
a
beast
your
marlowe
is
declared
whitney
hotly
i
know
what
marian
will
say
when
i
tell
her
you
are
here
in
new
york
and
wo
stop
for
even
a
word
with
her
sister
marian
will
say
it
all
right
said
jasper
a
trifle
impatiently
and
feeling
the
loss
of
every
moment
a
thing
to
be
atoned
for
marlowe
is
loaded
up
with
trouble
of
all
kinds
now
i
must
go
hold
on
a
minute
cried
mason
whitney
well
how
are
you
getting
on
seems
to
me
the
publishing
business
does
agree
with
you
you
look
peaked
enough
scanning
jasper
face
closely
i
well
enough
said
jasper
abruptly
tell
sister
marian
i
will
write
her
very
soon
pulling
out
his
watch
and
he
was
lost
in
the
crowd
surging
down
broadway
whitney
standing
still
a
moment
to
look
after
him
turned
and
went
directly
to
his
office
that
call
on
hendryx
can
wait
he
muttered
to
himself
on
the
way
but
jasper
ca
the
boy
looks
badly
and
his
father
ought
to
know
it
although
it
seems
funny
enough
for
me
to
be
meddling
with
jasper
affairs
but
i
wo
leave
anything
to
worry
about
afterward
they
ca
say
i
ought
to
have
told
them
so
a
letter
went
out
by
next
mail
from
whitney
office
saying
that
jasper
looked
poorly
enough
when
he
was
met
in
new
york
that
he
seemed
incapable
of
breathing
any
other
air
than
that
saturated
with
business
that
he
had
evidently
mistaken
his
vocation
when
he
chose
to
be
a
publisher
beside
there
is
any
money
now
in
the
publishing
business
added
whitney
as
a
clincher
there
are
too
many
of
the
fellows
cutting
each
other
throats
to
make
it
pay
and
books
are
slaughtered
right
and
left
and
jasper
much
better
get
into
some
other
business
in
my
opinion
meanwhile
jasper
finished
to
the
letter
the
instructions
for
jacob
bendel
did
up
the
other
matters
entrusted
to
him
and
set
out
on
his
troy
expedition
here
he
was
detained
a
day
or
two
instructions
being
to
wait
over
and
telegraph
if
the
business
could
not
be
adjusted
satisfactorily
but
the
fourth
day
after
leaving
home
jasper
just
from
the
night
express
mounted
the
stairs
to
his
hotel
in
the
early
morning
his
bag
in
his
hand
and
the
expression
on
his
face
of
a
man
who
has
accomplished
what
he
set
out
to
do
there
an
old
gent
up
in
your
room
announced
buttons
tumbling
off
a
sleepy
heap
from
one
of
the
office
chairs
to
look
at
him
an
old
gentleman
in
my
room
repeated
jasper
turning
on
the
stairs
why
was
any
person
put
in
my
room
we
did
put
the
person
there
said
the
boy
yawning
fearfully
he
put
himself
there
he
a
tiger
he
is
and
he
blows
me
up
you
ai
home
he
added
jasper
scaled
the
rest
of
the
stairs
and
tried
the
knob
of
his
door
with
no
gentle
hand
then
he
rapped
loudly
open
the
door
this
is
my
room
oh
i
coming
said
a
voice
he
knew
quite
well
and
presently
old
king
stood
before
him
his
velvet
cap
and
morning
jacket
both
awry
from
impatient
fingers
illustration
an
old
gentleman
in
my
room
repeated
jasper
turning
on
the
stairs
father
ejaculated
jasper
and
goodness
me
jasper
from
the
old
gentleman
what
an
unearthly
hour
to
come
home
in
jasper
hurried
in
set
his
bag
in
the
corner
then
turned
and
looked
at
his
father
anxiously
meanwhile
old
king
was
studying
his
countenance
with
no
small
degree
of
alarm
what
is
it
cried
jasper
at
last
coming
close
to
him
that
has
brought
you
what
why
you
me
cried
jasper
in
amazement
yes
dear
me
jasper
with
all
the
worries
i
have
had
lately
it
does
seem
a
pity
that
you
could
take
care
of
yourself
it
really
does
repeated
king
his
feelings
nowise
soothed
by
picking
up
his
watch
and
finding
it
six
when
he
made
sure
of
the
time
he
set
down
the
watch
quickly
and
stared
at
jasper
worse
than
ever
now
father
said
jasper
there
a
mistake
somewhere
but
never
mind
now
you
must
get
back
to
bed
again
i
do
know
when
you
been
up
at
this
hour
he
tried
to
laugh
while
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
old
gentleman
arm
do
get
back
to
bed
father
it
certainly
is
a
most
outrageous
hour
in
which
to
arise
remarked
his
father
not
able
to
suppress
a
yawn
and
i
do
mind
if
i
do
turn
in
but
where
will
you
sleep
jasper
whirling
around
on
his
son
come
to
look
after
you
and
i
should
begin
very
well
to
monopolize
your
bed
with
a
short
laugh
oh
i
camp
out
on
the
lounge
said
jasper
carelessly
in
two
minutes
i
could
be
asleep
there
or
anywhere
else
do
mind
me
father
if
you
say
so
then
i
will
said
the
old
gentleman
and
you
are
too
tired
to
talk
before
you
had
a
nap
so
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
jasper
dutifully
tucking
him
up
and
presently
his
regular
breathing
told
that
he
had
picked
up
the
threads
of
his
broken
slumber
jasper
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
but
unable
to
close
his
eyes
his
gaze
fell
on
a
sheet
of
paper
lying
on
the
floor
just
within
reach
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
reading
the
words
and
jasper
better
get
into
some
other
business
in
my
opinion
and
signed
mason
whitney
jasper
jumped
to
his
feet
and
strode
up
and
down
the
room
in
growing
indignation
then
seized
his
hat
and
darted
out
to
cool
himself
off
before
his
father
should
awake
when
he
returned
old
king
was
and
berating
buttons
for
his
failure
to
have
the
morning
paper
at
the
door
now
for
breakfast
cried
jasper
his
own
toilet
quickly
made
then
i
presume
you
want
to
see
me
in
my
business
surroundings
father
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
together
i
most
certainly
do
said
the
old
gentleman
decidedly
and
they
turned
into
the
breakfast
room
so
after
a
meal
in
which
jasper
by
skillful
management
of
all
conversational
topics
allowed
no
chance
word
of
business
to
intrude
old
king
and
he
started
for
the
publishing
house
of
marlowe
jasper
filling
up
all
gaps
that
might
suggest
time
for
certain
questions
that
seemed
to
be
trembling
on
the
tip
of
king
tongue
while
that
gentleman
was
making
a
running
commentary
to
himself
something
in
this
wise
just
like
mason
send
me
off
here
when
there
is
not
the
slightest
need
of
it
the
boy
is
well
enough
quite
well
enough
he
added
in
his
energy
speaking
the
last
words
aloud
what
is
it
father
jasper
paused
in
the
midst
of
a
descriptive
fire
concerning
the
new
buildings
going
up
on
either
hand
with
many
side
stories
of
the
men
who
were
erecting
them
and
he
paused
for
an
answer
nothing
nothing
of
importance
said
his
father
hastily
i
only
observed
that
you
appeared
to
be
doing
quite
well
and
as
if
the
business
agreed
with
you
he
added
involuntarily
i
should
think
it
did
father
cried
jasper
enthusiastically
while
his
cheek
glowed
it
the
grandest
work
a
man
can
do
in
my
opinion
hem
hem
well
we
shall
see
observed
king
drily
determined
not
to
yield
too
easily
you
been
at
it
only
six
months
you
know
the
old
adage
jasper
must
summer
and
winter
a
thing
before
you
decide
jasper
drew
a
long
breath
i
shall
never
be
anything
but
a
publisher
father
he
said
quietly
hoity
toity
well
that
is
for
me
to
decide
i
take
it
responded
his
father
you
never
disobeyed
me
yet
jasper
and
i
do
believe
you
ever
will
and
if
i
think
it
best
for
you
to
change
your
business
of
course
you
do
it
jasper
brow
darkened
and
he
closed
his
lips
tightly
for
a
moment
then
something
polly
said
once
when
his
father
was
in
a
particularly
determined
mood
came
to
his
mind
you
better
make
him
happy
jasper
any
way
that
any
way
carried
the
day
now
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
father
he
said
the
frown
disappearing
i
want
you
to
be
pleased
any
way
unconsciously
using
polly
word
i
do
know
as
i
should
be
at
all
pleased
to
have
you
leave
the
publishing
business
jasper
said
old
king
veering
around
quickly
i
ca
tell
till
i
seen
just
how
it
suits
you
but
i
am
going
to
the
root
of
the
matter
now
that
i
am
here
oh
is
this
the
place
as
they
came
up
against
a
large
window
behind
whose
plate
glass
rows
and
rows
of
books
in
all
styles
of
bindings
met
the
view
of
the
this
is
it
said
jasper
with
a
thrill
that
he
was
part
of
the
it
and
the
satisfaction
in
his
completed
commission
that
had
been
lost
by
his
father
words
now
bounded
high
again
now
then
father
you
must
meet
marlowe
turning
up
the
steps
old
king
walked
down
the
as
if
he
owned
the
whole
with
several
others
of
its
kind
thrown
in
and
on
jasper
pausing
before
a
small
marked
private
heard
him
say
through
its
open
window
mr
marlowe
ah
came
back
quickly
and
king
saw
a
gentleman
of
middle
age
whose
keen
gray
eyes
seemed
to
note
everything
with
rapidity
business
all
right
yes
sir
said
jasper
very
well
you
may
come
to
me
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
report
i
shall
be
through
with
these
gentlemen
indicating
one
sitting
by
his
side
at
the
desk
and
another
awaiting
his
turn
tell
him
that
i
am
here
jasper
said
king
pompously
with
an
admonitory
touch
upon
jasper
arm
it
impossible
father
he
ca
see
you
now
said
jasper
hurriedly
trying
to
draw
his
father
off
to
a
quieter
corner
impossible
ca
see
me
what
is
there
to
prevent
pray
tell
cried
the
old
gentleman
irately
illustration
good
morning
said
marlowe
quickly
business
all
right
he
has
business
men
with
him
they
be
through
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
jasper
brought
out
in
distress
that
was
by
no
means
lightened
by
the
knowledge
that
half
of
the
clerks
through
the
long
salesroom
were
becoming
acquainted
with
the
conversation
it
atrocious
i
never
was
kept
waiting
in
my
life
fumed
king
he
does
know
i
am
here
i
will
announce
myself
he
started
forward
father
cried
jasper
darting
after
him
let
me
get
you
a
chair
over
here
by
the
table
and
some
books
to
look
at
i
want
no
books
said
the
old
gentleman
now
thoroughly
determined
by
this
time
looking
in
the
open
window
of
the
private
office
sir
stiffly
to
the
gentleman
sitting
before
the
desk
this
gentleman
looked
up
nodded
carelessly
and
said
excuse
me
but
i
am
at
present
engaged
i
am
jasper
king
father
announced
the
old
gentleman
with
extreme
dignity
and
again
the
look
of
being
able
to
buy
out
this
and
several
other
such
establishments
spread
over
his
face
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
the
man
imperturbably
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
excuse
me
and
he
turned
back
to
finish
his
sentence
to
the
other
business
man
jasper
cried
king
taking
short
quick
steps
to
where
jasper
stood
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper
so
that
i
may
write
to
this
fellow
and
take
you
out
of
his
contemptible
trade
or
stay
i
will
write
from
the
hotel
and
he
started
for
the
door
father
exclaimed
jasper
in
a
low
tone
but
so
distinctly
that
every
one
standing
near
might
hear
mr
marlowe
is
just
right
he
always
is
eh
cried
his
father
turning
and
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
himself
marlowe
is
just
right
about
these
things
he
really
could
see
you
father
i
have
never
been
obliged
to
wait
for
any
one
in
all
my
life
jasper
declared
his
father
impressively
and
i
never
will
i
wonder
what
polly
would
do
now
thought
jasper
in
despair
and
that
you
could
tolerate
such
impertinence
to
me
continued
king
with
growing
anger
is
more
than
i
can
understand
but
since
you
come
into
trade
it
vastly
changed
you
if
you
do
not
choose
to
come
to
the
hotel
with
me
i
must
go
alone
which
with
great
dignity
he
now
proceeded
to
do
the
first
business
man
who
had
finished
his
conference
with
marlowe
now
came
down
the
salesroom
how
d
king
he
said
cordially
to
jasper
in
passing
jasper
face
lighted
as
he
gave
an
equally
cordial
response
such
familiarity
jasper
exclaimed
his
father
in
a
fresh
burst
of
irritation
dear
me
i
only
trust
you
not
completely
spoiled
before
i
get
you
out
of
this
the
business
man
turned
around
and
gave
a
significant
look
to
a
knot
of
the
salesmen
but
happening
to
catch
jasper
eye
he
said
it
a
fine
day
king
carelessly
and
passed
out
but
not
before
old
fell
upon
the
old
gentleman
ear
we
would
better
go
to
the
hotel
now
i
think
father
said
jasper
quietly
frank
to
the
nearest
salesman
will
you
tell
marlowe
when
it
is
ten
minutes
past
glancing
at
the
clock
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
with
my
father
but
i
will
be
back
at
ten
you
need
give
yourself
no
such
trouble
jasper
as
all
this
said
his
father
decidedly
i
will
wait
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
see
him
with
a
patronizing
wave
of
his
gloved
hand
toward
the
private
office
it
is
absolutely
necessary
said
jasper
very
well
i
wait
then
said
his
father
accepting
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
the
chair
by
the
table
of
books
and
just
then
the
private
opened
and
out
came
the
other
business
man
followed
by
marlowe
frank
he
called
briskly
ask
jasper
father
to
step
here
chapter
xviii
king
attends
to
matters
old
king
kept
on
turning
the
books
with
a
careless
hand
father
begged
jasper
in
a
low
voice
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
old
gentleman
arm
such
a
world
of
entreaty
in
his
face
that
his
father
turned
in
spite
of
himself
after
all
i
much
better
have
it
over
with
now
i
really
think
said
king
yes
jasper
we
will
go
back
with
a
marked
emphasis
on
the
word
back
i
ca
thank
you
enough
father
exclaimed
jasper
gratefully
well
well
say
no
more
said
old
king
abruptly
as
they
reached
the
private
office
marlowe
hands
were
mechanically
adjusting
the
loose
papers
on
his
desk
so
as
not
to
lose
an
instant
time
as
king
and
jasper
came
up
but
he
turned
a
face
over
which
a
bright
smile
shot
suddenly
lighting
up
the
gray
eyes
then
quickly
whirled
around
in
his
office
chair
glad
to
see
you
he
said
putting
out
a
cordial
right
hand
king
bowed
but
evidently
did
not
see
the
hand
which
marlowe
not
appearing
to
notice
the
old
gentleman
was
more
furious
than
ever
set
a
chair
for
your
father
jasper
said
marlowe
quietly
and
get
one
for
yourself
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
office
chair
and
pleasantly
surveyed
old
king
waiting
for
him
to
speak
i
have
come
sir
said
king
as
he
settled
his
courtly
old
figure
in
the
chair
jasper
had
put
for
him
beside
the
desk
to
see
you
about
my
son
i
am
not
satisfied
with
his
appearance
nor
i
am
sorry
to
say
with
his
surroundings
indeed
said
the
head
of
the
publishing
house
of
marlowe
still
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
i
am
very
sorry
repeated
jasper
father
to
have
to
say
it
but
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
fact
and
i
can
not
now
ignore
it
hardly
by
jasper
remarked
marlowe
bringing
the
revolving
chair
so
that
he
could
see
jasper
face
indeed
no
cried
jasper
involuntarily
it
is
something
father
has
heard
elsewhere
marlowe
and
i
know
he
will
feel
quite
differently
when
he
comes
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
the
grave
look
on
marlowe
face
disappeared
as
he
turned
back
to
old
king
well
he
said
at
last
as
the
other
showed
no
sign
of
continuing
the
conversation
and
still
playing
with
the
paper
cutter
on
his
desk
permit
me
to
say
sir
king
broke
out
finding
to
his
astonishment
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
talk
to
this
imperturbable
man
entrenched
behind
his
own
desk
that
i
am
disappointed
in
the
atmosphere
in
which
i
find
my
son
it
smells
of
trade
sir
too
much
to
suit
my
fancy
did
you
suppose
for
an
instant
king
asked
marlowe
dropping
the
to
pick
up
the
pencil
that
our
books
came
out
ready
for
libraries
without
any
intervening
process
i
certainly
supposed
jasper
was
to
be
in
charge
of
a
literary
department
of
the
house
when
i
gave
my
consent
to
his
coming
here
declared
king
very
decidedly
father
exclaimed
jasper
unable
longer
to
keep
silent
how
could
i
take
charge
of
any
department
until
i
had
learned
it
all
myself
you
have
been
through
harvard
his
father
turned
on
him
and
it
seems
to
me
are
fully
competent
to
do
the
literary
work
required
here
and
as
for
the
manufacturing
department
continued
jasper
finding
it
more
difficult
to
keep
still
it
was
the
only
place
for
me
i
had
to
begin
at
the
bottom
if
i
ever
to
be
a
publisher
which
is
what
my
work
is
to
be
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
cried
the
old
gentleman
excitedly
you
are
not
to
be
a
publisher
i
take
it
if
i
do
not
wish
it
you
given
your
word
you
will
not
i
have
given
my
word
father
said
jasper
with
a
long
breath
and
i
not
go
back
on
it
but
his
lips
whitened
all
this
while
marlowe
still
played
with
the
little
articles
on
his
desk
sitting
very
quietly
and
watching
the
two
he
now
threw
them
down
with
an
abrupt
movement
whirled
the
revolving
chair
around
suddenly
and
sent
a
glance
of
stern
inquiry
toward
old
king
be
so
kind
sir
as
to
define
exactly
what
your
intentions
are
as
to
your
son
future
time
is
very
valuable
here
and
every
fraction
squandered
has
to
be
made
up
in
some
way
my
intentions
are
said
the
old
gentleman
in
a
lofty
way
to
take
my
son
out
of
the
business
entirely
out
sir
he
waved
his
hand
in
a
stately
and
comprehensive
manner
then
glanced
to
see
the
effect
on
the
head
of
the
house
but
there
was
no
effect
whatever
except
a
quick
acceptance
of
the
situation
on
marlowe
implacable
face
father
began
jasper
but
old
king
was
beyond
hearing
a
word
i
had
intended
he
went
on
condescendingly
to
have
my
son
put
in
a
large
interest
in
the
business
supposing
it
turned
out
to
be
the
proper
one
for
him
in
fact
his
and
my
financial
support
would
have
made
it
one
of
the
finest
publishing
houses
in
the
world
marlowe
bowed
thank
you
he
said
politely
james
turning
to
the
window
opening
into
the
department
make
out
jasper
king
account
and
settle
at
once
i
believe
you
wish
to
go
as
soon
as
you
can
do
you
not
to
jasper
that
is
after
you
have
given
me
the
report
of
the
business
you
did
on
the
trip
jasper
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
he
said
but
i
ca
leave
my
work
in
this
way
it
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
jasper
marlowe
stopped
a
moment
and
seemed
to
swallow
something
in
his
throat
then
went
on
your
father
wishes
it
and
you
will
make
him
happy
jasper
started
at
polly
own
words
that
enough
for
one
life
time
i
sorry
to
lose
you
my
boy
he
suddenly
grasped
hand
but
allow
me
to
say
sir
turning
to
old
king
that
for
you
and
your
money
i
have
very
little
consideration
you
do
own
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
for
the
house
of
david
marlowe
to
extend
an
invitation
to
you
to
enter
it
and
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
hear
jasper
account
of
the
business
he
was
sent
on
with
that
seeing
it
was
expected
of
him
old
king
got
out
of
his
chair
by
the
side
of
the
desk
and
passed
into
the
long
salesroom
i
hope
you
believe
began
jasper
brokenly
feeling
as
if
the
whole
world
were
going
awry
that
this
strange
idea
was
never
gained
from
me
why
i
the
business
his
gray
eyes
glowed
as
he
spoke
the
word
my
boy
marlowe
face
was
alight
with
feeling
do
explain
i
understand
it
all
you
the
misfortune
to
be
born
into
a
rich
family
and
your
father
probably
never
had
to
raise
his
hand
to
earn
a
penny
he
is
to
be
blamed
only
i
did
hope
that
i
was
different
finished
jasper
his
head
drooping
a
bit
with
the
shame
of
it
oh
marlowe
father
is
so
splendid
he
just
a
magnificent
man
he
added
the
head
coming
up
with
jasper
old
habit
of
throwing
it
back
if
you
only
knew
him
and
he
could
have
shown
you
his
old
self
do
i
know
it
responded
marlowe
heartily
and
i
also
know
that
you
must
stick
by
him
only
i
did
hope
and
now
i
will
finish
what
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
could
stay
and
help
me
for
you
are
after
my
own
heart
jasper
he
added
abruptly
a
rare
tremble
in
his
voice
jasper
put
out
his
hand
instinctively
thank
you
marlowe
he
said
as
the
head
of
the
house
grasped
it
warmly
i
shall
never
forget
this
and
then
as
if
nothing
but
the
ordinary
business
had
occurred
jasper
sat
down
and
went
carefully
over
every
detail
of
the
commission
he
had
been
sent
on
heard
marlowe
terse
that
good
jasper
done
it
all
well
and
passed
out
for
the
last
time
from
the
private
office
and
joined
his
father
in
silence
for
the
walk
to
the
hotel
that
night
jasper
father
wanted
to
go
to
a
concert
so
jasper
got
a
box
and
sat
through
it
all
not
seeing
anything
but
polly
face
and
hearing
i
make
him
happy
any
way
down
in
the
audience
sprinkled
here
and
there
or
in
the
galleries
were
some
of
the
marlowe
salesmen
and
workers
staring
often
up
at
him
and
the
handsome
old
gentleman
by
his
side
there
that
old
snob
they
would
exclaim
at
first
recognition
to
their
companions
look
at
him
and
under
pretense
of
gazing
at
the
stage
the
opera
glasses
would
be
turned
on
the
box
looks
as
if
he
owned
the
whole
town
eh
he
is
awfully
handsome
is
he
every
salesman
companion
would
exclaim
looking
at
jasper
pale
and
quiet
in
the
most
secluded
part
of
the
box
yes
said
every
one
of
the
men
only
seeing
the
old
gentleman
but
he
too
toploftical
to
live
or
something
to
that
effect
and
then
they
would
forget
all
about
it
till
the
companion
opera
glasses
leveled
in
the
same
direction
brought
the
conversation
around
to
the
old
topic
they
had
a
with
marlowe
this
morning
confided
one
salesman
to
his
friend
in
the
and
he
off
with
a
nod
over
to
jasper
private
box
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
the
young
girl
with
a
pang
at
her
heart
has
he
left
your
business
yes
said
the
salesman
and
a
real
regret
passed
over
his
careless
face
and
it
a
shame
for
no
one
would
have
thought
he
owned
a
penny
he
was
just
digging
at
the
business
all
the
time
like
the
rest
of
us
is
he
very
rich
asked
the
young
girl
well
i
should
say
began
the
salesman
unable
to
find
words
to
express
jasper
financial
condition
then
the
curtain
rang
up
the
next
morning
old
king
broke
the
egg
into
his
cup
thoughtfully
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
look
about
a
bit
now
that
i
here
jasper
i
have
been
in
this
town
for
twenty
years
or
so
very
well
father
said
jasper
trying
not
to
be
listless
where
shall
we
go
oh
i
look
around
by
myself
said
his
father
quickly
you
go
to
bed
you
look
all
done
up
scanning
his
son
face
anxiously
indeed
you
will
not
go
alone
said
jasper
rousing
himself
with
shame
we
have
a
good
day
together
indeed
we
will
not
retorted
the
old
gentleman
i
shall
have
a
cab
and
go
by
myself
you
go
to
bed
or
i
call
in
the
doctor
goodness
me
jasper
you
do
look
like
the
same
boy
that
started
out
in
business
six
months
ago
you
all
worn
out
jasper
said
nothing
only
redoubled
his
efforts
on
the
breakfast
before
him
that
now
assumed
colossal
proportions
and
as
if
it
could
never
be
eaten
in
the
world
hoping
to
persuade
his
father
into
allowing
him
to
go
on
the
tour
of
inspection
but
it
was
no
use
king
on
finishing
his
morning
repast
stalked
out
to
the
office
and
ordered
a
carriage
and
presently
departed
with
last
injunctions
to
jasper
to
lie
down
and
take
things
easy
as
his
father
closed
the
door
jasper
sank
into
a
chair
by
the
table
and
allowed
his
head
to
drop
into
his
hands
but
only
for
a
minute
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
paced
the
floor
rapidly
if
polly
is
only
happy
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
how
long
he
walked
thus
he
never
knew
it
was
only
by
hearing
a
vigorous
knock
on
the
door
that
he
stopped
and
called
come
in
they
told
me
said
jack
loughead
answering
the
knock
at
the
marlowes
that
i
should
find
you
here
unless
you
had
left
the
town
are
you
sick
he
asked
with
concern
no
sit
down
do
loughead
said
jasper
dragging
forward
a
chair
and
falling
into
one
himself
just
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
a
stiff
pair
of
legs
jack
loughead
set
his
hat
on
the
table
and
himself
in
the
chair
that
jasper
proffered
then
he
fell
to
tapping
the
tip
of
his
shining
boot
with
his
walking
stick
king
i
came
here
to
ask
you
something
that
if
i
did
trust
you
so
well
i
could
never
ask
in
all
the
world
but
i
feel
i
can
trust
you
oh
do
do
begged
jasper
putting
up
an
unsteady
hand
to
ward
off
the
dreaded
subject
do
tell
me
anything
loughead
well
i
will
ask
you
something
then
said
jack
loughead
coolly
a
business
man
king
and
i
must
come
to
the
point
in
a
business
way
first
let
me
tell
you
that
uncle
and
i
start
for
australia
in
a
fortnight
jasper
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
yes
i
must
get
back
and
you
will
see
that
i
can
not
go
without
jack
loughead
paused
then
went
on
abruptly
does
miss
pepper
care
for
pickering
dodge
how
do
i
know
how
can
i
tell
cried
jasper
desperately
and
springing
from
his
chair
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
again
excuse
me
loughead
i
not
myself
i
left
marlowe
and
yes
i
know
interrupted
jack
and
drawing
a
long
breath
of
relief
on
his
part
at
being
able
to
speak
on
this
subject
now
that
the
ice
was
broken
well
i
glad
of
course
king
if
you
did
care
to
stay
he
said
but
i
did
cried
jasper
stopping
short
to
emphasize
this
marlowe
is
a
royal
man
through
and
through
and
i
work
for
him
all
my
life
but
my
father
thought
best
not
that
enough
he
added
in
the
abruptest
fashion
beginning
to
walk
again
yes
well
i
see
said
jack
i
know
a
little
what
relatives
can
do
to
make
a
young
man
life
miserable
i
sorry
king
and
he
looked
truly
wretched
over
it
and
you
must
forgive
anything
strange
about
me
said
jasper
walking
on
hurriedly
for
i
am
all
upset
yes
i
know
repeated
jack
loughead
nothing
breaks
a
man
up
like
wrenching
him
from
his
work
king
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
joined
jasper
walking
on
by
his
side
down
the
room
you
are
miss
brother
or
as
good
as
one
can
you
tell
me
if
i
shall
wrong
pickering
dodge
if
i
speak
to
her
jasper
was
saved
from
answering
by
old
king
coming
in
with
a
oh
how
d
loughead
well
well
jasper
you
had
a
good
nap
i
take
it
and
then
all
three
went
down
to
luncheon
and
jasper
managed
not
to
be
left
alone
with
jack
loughead
until
at
the
last
when
he
said
i
shall
go
and
tell
the
whole
story
to
fisher
of
course
i
must
speak
to
her
first
halloo
dave
it
was
such
a
remarkable
cry
that
david
turned
at
once
although
he
was
almost
on
a
dead
run
across
the
campus
hey
there
shouted
percy
whitney
as
david
turned
whew
how
you
do
go
dave
what
the
matter
cried
david
running
lightly
back
to
stand
in
front
of
percy
dear
me
percy
you
have
lost
your
eyeglasses
with
a
glance
at
the
other
flushed
face
wait
i
find
the
things
i
yelled
my
lungs
sore
said
percy
in
irritation
dropping
down
on
his
knees
to
pass
his
hands
carefully
over
the
campus
grass
and
now
lost
these
bad
luck
to
you
dave
for
it
oh
go
without
said
david
getting
gingerly
down
on
to
prowl
around
on
the
greensward
go
without
repeated
percy
sitting
straight
in
indignation
how
could
i
see
pray
tell
do
be
a
donkey
dave
david
said
nothing
but
fell
to
a
more
diligent
search
while
percy
bewailed
his
loss
watching
eagerly
david
nimble
fingers
moving
in
and
out
of
the
little
tufts
of
grass
shades
of
the
departed
specs
cried
david
also
sitting
straight
and
peering
with
his
keen
blue
eyes
in
a
birdlike
way
along
the
sward
a
mysteri
oh
great
caesar
then
he
fell
on
his
back
on
the
campus
and
rolled
and
laughed
to
bring
up
red
and
shining
only
to
tumble
over
and
roll
again
of
all
the
idiots
in
the
universe
dave
pepper
fumed
percy
the
matter
your
trouble
has
gone
to
your
head
said
david
faintly
feel
and
see
oh
dear
illustration
how
you
can
sit
there
and
laugh
when
joe
is
in
danger
i
do

exclaimed
percy
irritably
percy
hand
flew
up
to
his
thick
mane
of
brown
hair
that
not
all
his
disgust
and
tireless
training
could
persuade
to
lie
smoothly
when
he
picked
off
his
beloved
glasses
after
an
angry
twitch
or
two
how
you
can
sit
there
and
laugh
when
joe
is
in
danger
i
do
see
he
exclaimed
irritably
adjusting
them
to
his
nose
i
nearly
killed
myself
to
catch
you
and
joe
in
danger
cried
david
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
oh
percy
what
do
you
mean
his
cheeks
whitening
and
his
blue
eyes
agleam
joel
brought
it
on
himself
said
percy
his
irritation
not
going
down
i
must
say
dave
if
he
behave
more
like
the
rest
of
us
be
then
polly
words
oh
dear
beautiful
joel
came
to
mind
and
he
coughed
violently
holding
fast
the
eyeglasses
in
their
place
what
danger
demanded
david
in
his
impatience
shaking
percy
arm
well
you
must
know
after
last
night
performance
over
joe
that
they
would
let
him
alone
last
night
performance
over
joel
repeated
david
in
astonishment
what
yarn
are
you
spinning
now
percy
goodness
sake
you
are
yarning
yourself
retorted
percy
indignantly
to
pretend
that
you
do
know
that
last
night
a
dozen
or
more
fellows
called
on
joe
and
he
handled
without
gloves
so
that
bingley
and
dobbs
ca
hardly
step
it
the
first
word
i
heard
of
it
said
david
slowly
but
emphatically
and
staggering
back
a
step
or
two
to
look
at
percy
i
was
out
all
the
evening
oh
magnificent
old
joe
magnificent
old
joe
repeated
percy
you
better
say
joe
when
you
know
what
they
are
intending
to
give
him
chapter
xix
mother
fisher
and
charlotte
david
blue
eyes
flashed
dangerously
tell
all
you
know
percy
he
said
briefly
dobbs
heads
it
as
he
did
the
first
one
said
percy
they
changed
their
tactics
and
will
get
at
joe
on
their
way
home
from
that
confounded
meeting
dave
ca
you
keep
him
from
that
and
percy
forgetting
himself
peered
anxiously
over
his
glasses
no
said
david
shortly
and
i
try
you
an
idiot
cried
percy
in
a
passion
a
stupid
blind
old
donkey
joe
will
be
mauled
dreadfully
he
howled
beating
his
hands
together
in
distress
no
help
for
it
but
to
keep
him
away
from
that
old
association
meeting
anything
more
to
tell
asked
david
no
percy
shot
out
bingley
told
me
all
he
knew
but
they
let
him
catch
much
of
it
because
he
left
the
gang
david
feet
by
this
time
were
flying
over
the
campus
so
that
percy
was
obliged
to
shout
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
after
him
the
consequence
was
that
several
heads
were
popped
out
of
as
many
windows
in
the
long
gray
dormitory
fronting
the
campus
their
owners
all
engaged
in
the
pleasing
duty
of
staring
at
percy
and
the
flying
figure
across
the
grass
now
i
in
for
it
for
there
dobbs
i
vow
exclaimed
percy
to
himself
in
dismay
he
guess
i
given
dave
warning
and
he
tried
to
strike
a
careless
attitude
picking
off
his
glasses
to
hold
them
up
and
gaze
long
and
earnestly
through
them
into
the
nearest
tree
you
ca
come
it
jeered
dobbs
from
his
window
no
birdsnesting
i
promise
you
whitney
ha
ha
and
the
other
heads
popped
farther
out
than
ever
to
add
a
few
hisses
percy
maddened
by
the
failure
of
his
plan
to
divert
suspicion
now
lost
his
head
entirely
and
sticking
his
eyeglasses
on
again
ran
off
like
lightning
to
his
room
followed
by
little
coward
we
treat
you
too
look
out
well
jasper
now
i
bound
for
the
next
thing
percy
and
joel
and
david
declared
old
king
as
jack
loughead
was
cleverly
off
we
are
so
near
it
a
pity
not
to
drop
down
on
them
do
you
think
you
ought
to
hurry
back
to
brierly
asked
jasper
having
hard
work
not
to
show
that
he
cared
anything
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
no
i
do
answered
his
father
in
his
crispest
fashion
no
one
needs
me
there
cabot
is
a
host
in
herself
and
those
boys
may
who
knows
at
any
rate
i
must
see
how
they
are
getting
on
so
we
will
go
as
soon
as
you
can
get
your
things
packed
and
sent
home
and
the
old
gentleman
glanced
around
the
room
at
the
various
keepsakes
and
family
adornings
that
jasper
had
brought
with
him
to
make
life
less
lonely
while
he
made
a
business
man
of
himself
very
well
father
said
jasper
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
say
more
and
for
the
first
time
had
to
hurry
away
that
his
father
might
not
see
his
face
but
old
king
was
the
farthest
removed
from
carrying
the
look
of
a
person
holding
any
interest
whatever
in
jasper
trouble
for
he
went
on
to
say
and
i
do
hope
you
will
get
it
over
with
as
quickly
as
possible
jasper
so
that
we
may
be
off
then
he
fell
to
reading
the
evening
paper
with
great
gusto
jasper
seized
his
hat
rushed
down
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
nearly
overturning
buttons
leaning
on
the
post
at
the
foot
oh
beg
pardon
said
jasper
quite
as
if
it
had
been
a
gentleman
he
had
run
against
you
hai
hurt
me
none
said
buttons
staggering
back
to
his
support
where
he
craned
his
neck
in
curiosity
to
watch
young
impatience
once
out
in
the
park
a
away
his
hands
thrust
in
their
pockets
jasper
slackened
his
pace
and
breathed
freer
before
him
seemed
to
be
the
little
brown
house
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
pepper
and
they
had
just
finished
their
long
talk
when
the
mother
had
thanked
him
for
rescuing
phronsie
from
the
the
five
little
peppers
were
begging
him
to
come
over
again
to
see
them
but
pepper
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
be
sure
jasper
she
warned
that
your
father
is
willing
he
could
see
her
black
eyes
looking
down
into
his
face
what
would
she
say
now
jasper
threw
himself
down
on
one
of
the
seats
under
a
friendly
tree
at
least
polly
you
be
ashamed
of
me
he
said
in
a
moment
or
two
and
dear
fisher
then
he
walked
quietly
off
to
make
the
last
preparations
that
his
father
had
ordered
well
now
charlotte
said
fisher
you
need
worry
not
a
single
bit
and
she
went
on
calmly
sorting
out
the
small
flannel
petticoats
in
her
lap
that
is
rather
thin
she
said
holding
up
one
between
her
eyes
and
the
light
king
fisher
how
you
do
kick
things
out
mrs
fisher
exclaimed
charlotte
chatterton
in
amazement
how
can
you
sit
picking
over
flannel
petticoats
when
perhaps
polly
will
oh
do
excuse
me
she
broke
off
hastily
for
speaking
so
polly
i
trust
my
girl
to
know
what
was
sense
and
what
was
nonsense
declared
mother
fisher
crisply
and
not
taking
off
her
attention
in
the
slightest
from
baby
petticoats
screamed
little
king
so
we
would
would
we
birdie
she
said
nodding
at
him
but
people
do
such
very
strange
things
in
in
love
said
charlotte
her
face
full
of
distress
i
mean
when
love
is
in
the
question
mrs
fisher
polly
does
said
fisher
scornfully
polly
has
never
been
in
love
why
she
is
only
twenty
charlotte
gave
an
uneasy
whirl
and
rushed
off
to
the
window
and
there
that
dreadful
hateful
cabot
she
cried
plunging
back
her
pale
eyes
afire
oh
i
feel
so
wicked
fisher
whenever
i
think
of
her
i
like
to
tear
her
i
would
for
picking
at
polly
she
declared
with
venom
you
need
be
afraid
repeated
fisher
calmly
polly
knows
cabot
through
and
through
and
will
never
be
influenced
by
anything
she
says
oh
dear
dear
dear
cried
charlotte
wringing
her
long
hands
and
there
that
loughead
and
everything
is
mixed
up
and
i
frighten
you
now
just
see
here
charlotte
cried
mother
fisher
casting
aside
the
flannel
petticoats
to
look
up
you
must
just
put
your
mind
off
from
all
this
i
should
never
know
you
my
girl
you
are
always
so
sensible
and
quiet
why
charlotte
what
has
gotten
into
you
that
just
it
cried
charlotte
a
pink
passion
in
her
sallow
cheeks
everybody
thinks
because
i
do
rant
every
day
that
i
have
any
more
feeling
than
a
stick
or
a
stone
oh
do
excuse
me
fisher
but
i
love
polly
so
and
she
flung
herself
down
on
her
knees
burying
her
face
among
the
little
flannel
petticoats
in
mother
fisher
lap
there
there
my
dear
said
fisher
smoothing
charlotte
pale
straight
hair
of
course
you
love
polly
everybody
does
and
i
do
do
want
her
to
marry
that
pickering
dodge
mumbled
charlotte
certainly
not
and
she
no
more
likely
to
marry
him
than
you
are
said
fisher
coolly
giving
gentle
pats
to
charlotte
head
while
king
fisher
screamed
and
twitched
his
mother
gown
in
anger
to
see
the
petting
going
on
well
now
i
have
two
babies
said
mother
fisher
with
a
smile
lifting
him
up
to
her
lap
where
he
amused
himself
by
beating
on
head
with
both
fat
fists
till
his
mother
seized
them
with
one
hand
while
she
gently
smoothed
the
girl
hair
with
the
other
polly
can
be
trusted
anywhere
and
when
she
is
in
too
much
of
a
dilemma
then
she
brings
everything
to
mother
charlotte
sat
up
straight
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
we
got
somebody
else
to
worry
about
much
more
and
all
our
sympathies
ought
to
go
out
to
him
said
fisher
gravely
charlotte
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
that
grandpapa
has
taken
jasper
away
from
his
business
she
sat
king
fisher
abruptly
on
the
floor
all
the
little
petticoats
tumbling
after
him
and
walked
away
so
that
charlotte
could
not
see
her
face
poor
jasper
he
loved
his
work
so
illustration
well
now
i
have
two
babies
said
mother
fisher
and
that
just
it
gasped
charlotte
somehow
finding
her
feet
to
hurry
over
to
fisher
jasper
has
lost
his
work
and
now
oh
dear
oh
ca
you
see
fisher
and
then
frightened
at
her
boldness
she
ran
back
to
baby
charlotte
chatterton
exclaimed
fisher
there
was
something
so
dreadful
in
her
tone
that
charlotte
without
a
word
ran
out
of
the
room
to
meet
little
fisher
hurrying
upstairs
with
his
hands
full
of
letters
a
whole
budget
from
brierly
he
announced
joyfully
two
for
you
my
girl
casting
them
into
her
hands
and
the
folks
are
coming
home
next
week
that
is
our
folks
good
news
eh
charlotte
then
he
sped
on
to
find
his
wife
and
at
dinner
charlotte
sitting
pale
and
immovable
amidst
all
the
chat
let
the
news
of
and
mason
whitney
and
dick
determination
to
come
on
to
greet
the
arrivals
from
the
brierly
farmhouse
fall
on
apparently
unheeding
ears
charlotte
cried
fisher
at
last
looking
at
her
through
his
big
spectacles
why
i
thought
you
would
rejoice
with
us
he
added
reproachfully
adoniram
exclaimed
fisher
across
the
table
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
looking
as
if
she
would
like
to
step
on
his
toes
the
little
doctor
stared
at
her
a
moment
oh
er
never
mind
my
dear
he
cried
abruptly
turning
to
charlotte
i
suppose
you
do
not
feel
well
yes
i
do
feel
well
said
charlotte
truthfully
not
daring
to
look
at
fisher
but
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
i
have
a
letter
from
king
a
very
long
one
he
is
going
to
see
joel
and
david
mother
fisher
made
haste
to
say
i
hope
he
has
heard
anything
wrong
about
them
and
a
little
anxious
pucker
came
on
her
forehead
charlotte
chatterton
glanced
up
quickly
and
seeing
it
oh
i
do
believe
everything
is
all
right
fisher
she
exclaimed
involuntarily
mother
fisher
looked
straight
at
her
with
one
of
her
brightest
smiles
i
guess
so
she
said
her
brow
clearing
and
after
they
had
pulled
back
their
chairs
from
the
table
and
the
little
doctor
had
gone
into
his
office
for
a
minute
fisher
followed
charlotte
out
into
the
hall
charlotte
and
she
put
both
hands
on
the
girl
shoulders
you
and
i
wo
meddle
with
the
lord
will
for
polly
promise
me
that
you
not
say
one
word
of
what
we
were
talking
to
any
one
i
wo
said
charlotte
chatterton
and
now
said
mother
fisher
dropping
her
arms
and
resuming
her
usual
cheery
manner
you
and
i
charlotte
have
got
to
put
our
minds
on
getting
ready
for
the
whitneys
and
the
and
we
must
make
it
just
the
brightest
time
that
ever
was
i
no
good
at
thinking
up
ways
to
celebrate
added
fisher
with
a
little
laugh
polly
always
did
that
so
you
must
do
it
for
me
you
and
the
doctor
charlotte
and
you
better
run
in
to
his
office
now
and
make
a
beginning
for
next
week
will
come
before
we
know
it
and
with
a
motherly
pat
and
a
run
along
child
fisher
waited
to
see
charlotte
well
on
the
way
before
she
turned
to
her
own
duties
come
in
cried
little
fisher
as
she
rapped
at
the
office
door
oh
it
you
charlotte
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
sure
i
do
feel
much
like
dragging
on
my
boots
and
going
off
to
the
land
end
on
a
call
fisher
thought
i
ought
to
come
and
see
you
sir
about
getting
up
a
plan
to
celebrate
the
next
week
said
charlotte
feeling
her
heart
bounding
already
with
delight
would
they
really
all
be
together
in
a
week
now
that
something
like
exclaimed
fisher
joyfully
and
pushing
aside
with
a
reckless
hand
his
books
and
vials
on
the
table
sit
down
do
charlotte
there
as
charlotte
settled
her
long
figure
in
the
opposite
chair
now
then
i
never
got
up
a
plan
to
celebrate
anything
in
my
life
said
charlotte
folding
her
hands
in
dismay
nor
i
either
confessed
the
little
doctor
in
an
equal
tremor
polly
was
always
great
at
those
things
but
i
suppose
that
the
reason
my
wife
set
us
two
together
charlotte
for
she
the
wisest
of
women
and
perhaps
we
ought
to
learn
how
to
get
up
celebrations
if
only
phronsie
were
home
breathed
charlotte
wistfully
i
so
afraid
our
affair
will
be
worse
than
nothing
i
dare
say
replied
the
little
doctor
cheerily
but
we
can
try
and
that
goes
a
great
way
charlotte
trying
does
illustration
i
always
found
said
fisher
that
all
you
had
to
do
to
start
a
thing
was
to
begin
charlotte
drew
a
long
breath
and
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
if
we
only
knew
how
to
begin
she
said
at
last
doubtfully
i
always
found
said
fisher
springing
from
his
chair
that
all
you
had
to
do
to
start
a
thing
was
to
begin
yes
that
just
it
ruminated
charlotte
bringing
up
her
hands
to
hold
her
head
with
i
think
we
are
in
a
tight
place
dr
fisher
hum
that
may
be
assented
the
little
man
i
like
tight
places
now
then
charlotte
how
do
you
say
begin
charlotte
sat
lost
in
thought
for
a
minute
then
she
said
any
way
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
get
up
something
very
simple
so
long
as
we
are
beginners
i
think
so
too
agreed
fisher
so
that
settled
now
for
the
first
thing
what
do
you
say
we
should
do
charlotte
how
would
it
do
asked
charlotte
suddenly
to
invite
everybody
after
they
have
gotten
over
the
first
of
the
after
dinner
i
mean
into
the
and
then
tell
them
that
we
are
not
smart
enough
to
think
up
things
and
ask
them
to
give
a
recitation
apiece
or
something
of
that
sort
charlotte
chatterton
exclaimed
the
little
doctor
cramming
his
hands
into
the
side
pockets
of
his
office
coat
and
staring
at
her
i
am
ashamed
of
you
that
would
be
shabby
enough
not
so
bad
either
he
added
quickly
a
sudden
thought
striking
him
as
you
do
your
part
in
singing
oh
i
could
sing
cried
charlotte
drawing
back
into
her
shell
of
coldness
again
they
do
any
of
them
care
for
it
they
heard
me
so

smooth
her
refusal

the
little
doctor

a
notion
that

suit

and
he
threw
himself
into
his
office
chair
and
looked
charlotte
squarely
in
the
face
why

ask
alexia
and
cathie
and
the
others
to
take
hold
and
get
up
some
fandango
eh
charlotte
caught
herself
on
the
edge
of
saying
no
then
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
well
trying
not
to
seem
indifferent
over
the
plan
do
like

fisher
regarding

keenly

fisher
bringing
his
hands
together
with
a
joyful
clap
and
getting
out
of
his
chair
he
began
to
skip
up
and
down
like
a
boy
and

straightening
out
affairs
two
days
after
old
king
was
walking
over
the
college
campus
bound
for
joel
and
david
room
in
the
old
brick
dormitory
i
am
glad
i
sent
jasper
ahead
to
the
hotel
i
much
rather
pop
in
on
the
boys
by
myself
soliloquized
the
old
gentleman
in
great
satisfaction
ah
here
it
is
beginning
to
mount
the
stairs
come
in
yelled
a
voice
as
he
rapped
with
his
on
the
door
of
no
and
do
make
such
a
piece
of
work
breaking
the
door
down
oh
beg
pardon
as
king
obeyed
the
order
a
tall
figure
sprawled
in
the
biggest
chair
his
long
legs
carried
up
to
the
mantel
where
his
boots
neatly
reposed
while
a
cloud
of
smoke
filling
the
room
made
king
cough
violently
in
spite
of
himself
is
a
nasty
air
said
the
tall
young
man
getting
his
legs
down
in
haste
from
the
mantel
and
himself
out
of
the
chair
though
with
much
difficulty
take
a
glass
of
water
sir
hobbling
over
to
a
side
table
and
pouring
one
out
to
work
his
way
with
it
to
old
king
thank
you
said
the
old
gentleman
when
he
could
speak
and
accepting
it
quickly
you
say
truly
the
air
is
beastly
glancing
around
the
room
in
displeasure
at
the
plentiful
signs
of
its
inmates
idea
of
having
a
good
time
at
college
are
joel
and
david
pepper
soon
to
be
in
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
up
the
cover
of
a
french
novel
thrown
on
the
lounge
near
him
and
dropped
it
quickly
as
he
read
the
title
hey
oh
i
see
a
little
mistake
exclaimed
the
tall
youth
going
unsteadily
back
to
his
chair
their
room
is
in
the
extension
i
am
robert
bingley
sir
i
very
glad
cried
old
king
heartily
for
i
do
mind
telling
you
my
young
friend
that
i
should
want
joel
and
david
room
to
look
like
this
i
do
blame
you
in
the
least
sir
said
bingley
nowise
abashed
but
you
need
worry
for
the
peppers

my
kind
you
must
be
grandfather
king
he
added
yes
i
am
said
old
king
straightening
up
and
throwing
back
his
white
hair
with
a
proud
gesture
so
you
heard
about
me
he
asked
in
a
gratified
way
i
should
rather
think
we
had
said
bingley
why
all
of
us
know
about
you
sir
here
he
got
out
of
his
chair
again
you
wo
care
to
after
you
know
all
but
i
should
like
to
shake
hands
with
you
sir
most
certainly
responded
the
old
gentleman
heartily
although
your
room
is
to
your
credit
thereupon
he
bestowed
a
courtly
upon
the
young
man
with
the
utmost
cordiality
making
bingley
who
seemed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
his
legs
to
retreat
to
his
chair
in
a
high
state
of
satisfaction
it
was
mean
of
me
to
ask
you
such
a
favor
sir
said
bingley
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
before
i
had
told
you
all
but
i
could
help
it
some
way
and
i
knew
you
would
touch
my
hand
after
you
heard
well
i
was
one
of
a
gang
who
went
to
joe
pepper
room
last
week
for
the
purpose
of
lamming
him
you
went
to
joe
pepper
room
for
the
purpose
of
lamming
him
repeated
old
king
darting
out
of
his
chair
yes
sir
bingley
still
kept
his
gaze
glued
to
the
ceiling
but
we
did
do
it
though
joe
lammed
us
oh
so
the
rest
of
the
gang
are
going
for
him
i
not
able
to
said
bingley
trying
to
appear
careless
joel
to
be
in
such
business
how
could
he
fumed
old
king
a
gentleman
and
i
thought
so
much
of
his
turning
out
well
it
will
kill
his
mother
oh
how
could
he
turning
fiercely
on
bingley
see
here
now
cried
that
individual
tearing
his
gaze
from
the
ceiling
to
send
a
sharp
glance
at
the
old
gentleman
joe
is
all
right
straight
as
a
brick
you
can
bet
your
money
on
that
sir
oh
oh
cried
king
more
and
more
horrified
is
this
what
you
all
come
to
college
for
i
should
consider
sir
very
sternly
it
a
place
to
keep
up
the
dignity
of
one
family
in
and
that
of
such
a
venerable
institution
waving
both
shapely
hands
to
include
the
entire
pile
of
buildings
by
which
they
were
surrounded
bingley
gave
vent
to
an
uncontrollable
laugh
beg
pardon
sir
but
the
dignity
is
worth
a
rush
we
are
in
the
old
hole
and
all
we
look
out
for
is
to
have
a
good
time
and
scrape
through
old
hole
and
scrape
through
oh
dear
oh
dear
groaned
old
king
that
what
our
set
do
said
bingley
to
give
him
time
to
recover
joe
and
davina
ah
i
mean
david
do
train
in
our
crowd
the
other
one
whitney
do
tell
me
that
he
does
interrupted
percy
grandfather
sharply
it
would
be
possible
no
he
does
affect
us
said
bingley
coolly
it
all
he
can
do
to
take
care
of
those
eyeglasses
of
his
and
he
muss
his
clothes
whitney
is
something
of
a
softy
sir
old
king
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
but
he
looked
so
troubled
that
bingley
for
the
life
of
him
could
keep
up
his
assumed
carelessness
sit
down
again
do
sir
he
begged
involuntarily
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
king
resuming
his
chair
presently
had
a
graphic
account
of
joel
course
in
college
with
a
description
of
the
trouble
in
his
room
till
the
whole
thing
was
laid
bare
how
i
wish
i
had
been
here
to
see
my
boy
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
with
sparkling
eyes
i
might
have
helped
him
a
bit
he
stretched
out
a
handsome
fist
and
looked
at
it
as
admiringly
as
any
college
athlete
could
view
his
own
well
dropping
his
arm
i
am
interrupting
you
groping
for
the
name
bingley
sir
ah
yes
bingley
well
bingley
pray
go
on
did
you
not
say
that
another
attempt
was
to
be
made
on
my
grandson
bingley
nodded
after
he
comes
from
the
association
rooms
he
added
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
drily
in
a
manner
that
delighted
bingley
and
made
him
tingle
all
over
to
be
in
at
the
death
himself
dobbs
has
planned
it
to
dobbs
interrupted
the
old
gentleman
sharply
what
family

ingoldsby
dobbs

trust
this
chap
name
is
ingoldsby
dobbs
said
bingley
he
a
i

suppose
he
thinks

since

were
boys
he
capital
stock
well

on
bingley
and
let
me
know
what
this
young
rascal
is
up
to
he
added
with
extreme
irritation
he
is
going
to
have
his
men
close
in
on
joe
in
the
middle
of
the
park
pepper
often
comes
that
way
to
brick
short
you
know
for
brick
dormitory
with
a
poor
miserable
cuss
excuse
me
sir
trying
to
get
up
on
to
sober
legs
there
are
twenty
fellows
pledged
to
do
the
job
i
found
out
bingley
did
think
it
worth
while
to
mention
how
the
plan
was
discovered
nor
that
heavy
vengeance
was
vowed
upon
his
head
if
he
divulged
it
i
gave
it
away
to
whitney
i
could
get
at
davi
er
dave
to
see
if
it
was
possible
to
keep
joe
away
from
that
meeting
it
would
come
some
time
it
better
be
said
the
old
gentleman
briefly
well
is
that
all
yes
sir
only
that
they
are
to
toss
a
cloak
over
joe
head
and
carry
him
off
for
a
little
initiation
fun
ah
old
king
sat
quite
straight
thank
you
bingley
he
said
getting
out
of
his
chair
he
did
offer
to
shake
hands
and
bingley
though
pretending
not
to
notice
any
omission
of
that
sort
felt
considerably
about
it
the
moment
the
door
was
shut
and
he
heard
king
go
down
the
stairs
robert
bingley
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
giving
a
savage
pull
at
the
innocent
locks
curse
my
luck
he
growled
taking
out
the
angry
fingers
to
shake
them
at
his
legs
tied
here
by
these
two
beggars
and
he
thinks
that
sneaking
out
of
standing
up
for
joe
old
king
fumed
to
himself
all
the
way
down
the
stairs
becoming
more
angry
with
each
step
when
he
reached
the
lower
hall
he
turned
and
passed
through
the
building
instead
of
going
out
and
meeting
a
young
collegian
on
a
run
asked
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
sir
does
ingoldsby
dobbs
room
in
this
building
no
in
the
extension
said
the
undergraduate
not
slackening
speed
and
pointing
the
direction
so
the
old
gentleman
climbed
the
staircase
to
the
wing
and
presently
rapped
on
the
door
marked
uproarious
shouts
of
laughter
greeted
him
as
he
opened
the
door
in
response
to
a
loud
come
in
the
noise
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
was
possible
for
the
inmates
of
the
room
to
check
it
when
they
saw
the
visitor
but
not
before
we
season
pepper
well
and
make
the
deacon
howl
came
distinctly
to
his
ears
good
afternoon
young
gentlemen
said
old
king
bowing
his
white
head
and
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
advanced
to
the
table
around
which
sat
six
or
eight
of
them
i
beg
of
you
not
to
go
as
some
of
them
made
a
sudden
movement
to
leave
i
should
like
to
see
you
all
though
i
called
especially
upon
ingoldsby
dobbs
a
tall
wiry
youth
with
sallow
face
and
nose
disentangled
himself
from
the
group
and
came
forward
i
do
remember
where
i
have
met
you
sir
he
said
yet
extending
his
hand
with
his
best
manner
on
aristocratic
old
party
whispered
one
man
to
his
neighbor
dobbsey
need
be
afraid
to
claim
him
i
am
very
thankful
to
say
i
never
have
met
you
before
young
man
observed
king
coolly
not
seeing
the
slender
hand
waiting
for
his
your
father
honors
me
with
his
friendship
this
may
tell
you
who
i
am
and
he
threw
a
card
upon
the
table
young
dobbs
sallow
face
turned
a
shade
paler
as
he
picked
up
the
card
and
read
it
glad
to
see
you
sit
down
wo
you
he
mumbled
dragging
up
a
comfortable
chair
any
friend
of
father
is
welcome
here
he
went
on
awkwardly
while
the
rest
of
the
men
stared
at
him
one
of
them
exclaiming
under
his
breath
first
time
dobbs
cheek
deserted
him
wager
the
old
gentleman
looked
first
into
ingoldsby
dobbs
thin
face
then
surveyed
them
all
quite
leisurely
i
understand
you
paid
my
grandson
joel
pepper
a
call
a
short
time
since
when
instead
of
abusing
him
some
of
you
got
your
deserts
the
men
started
and
angry
exclamations
went
around
the
room
turned
coward
the
mean
sneak
we
pay
him
up
and
remarks
of
a
like
nature
being
quite
audible
old
king
turned
on
them
silence
he
commanded
my
grandson
joel
does
know
i
am
here
i
heard
the
story
since
my
arrival
if
any
one
says
one
word
against
him
i
cane
him
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
the
bottom
and
he
looked
as
if
he
could
do
it
was
bingley
then
said
dobbs
sullenly
the
old
gentleman
completely
ignored
him
addressing
his
words
to
the
crowd
there
are
four
men
in
this
class
who
are
going
to
be
protected
from
your
insults
those
are
my
three
grandsons
and
robert
bingley
and
this
is
to
be
done
without
appealing
to
the
college
authorities
either
that
puts
a
stop
to
your
fine
plan
dobbs
at
last
looking
at
him
and
any
other
idea
of
the
same
sort
your
fertile
brain
may
chance
to
think
up
the
first
intimation
of
any
hostility
and
your
father
and
the
fathers
of
these
men
here
with
you
waving
his
hand
at
them
all
and
of
the
others
in
this
interesting
plan
will
be
informed
and
you
will
be
dealt
with
exactly
like
any
other
disturber
of
the
peace
villains
in
college
or
out
of
it
ought
to
be
served
to
the
same
punishment
in
my
opinion
now
have
any
of
you
remarks
to
make
it
was
so
like
joel
invitation
to
come
on
and
have
it
out
now
that
not
a
single
man
of
them
stirred
then
i
will
have
the
pleasure
of
bidding
you
said
king
and
the
next
moment
he
was
outside
of
no
while
perfect
silence
reigned
within
polly
came
slowly
down
higby
front
stairs
and
looked
at
phronsie
standing
at
the
further
end
of
the
entry
what
the
matter
phronsie
at
last
she
asked
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
phronsie
seemed
unable
to
answer
polly
and
she
stood
quite
still
her
gaze
fastened
on
the
muslin
curtain
that
swung
back
and
forth
in
the
breeze
that
came
through
the
open
window
now
phronsie
said
polly
very
decidedly
and
going
up
to
her
you

what
the
matter

persisted
phronsie
shaking
her
head
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
who
has
been
telling
you
things
cried
polly
her
brown
eyes
flashing
that
you

not
to

for

no

phronsie
in
great
distress
and
clutching
polly
gown
oh

declared
polly

phronsie
huddling
up
closer
to
polly
in
dismay

please
mamsie
would
ever
allow
you

annoyed
about

polly
with
increasing
irritation
and
if
cabot
has
said
anything
to
you
phronsie
to
make
you
feel
badly
why
i
must
know
it
do
you
see
child
that
i
really
ought
to
be
told
phronsie
folded
her
hands
tightly
together
trying
to
keep
them
quiet
and
her
cheeks
turned
so
very
white
that
polly
hastened
to
put
her
well
arm
around
her
saying
quickly
there
there
child
you
need
tell
me
now
if
you
do
want
to
wait
a
bit
i
had
rather
tell
it

said
phronsie
but
oh
i
do
wish
that
grandpapa
was
here
she
added
sadly
whatever

have
been
said
to
you
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay

phronsie
with
distinctness
jasper

going
to
be
at
marlowe
any
more
repeated
polly
wildly
and
holding
phronsie
so
closely
that
she
winced
oh
what
do
you
mean
who

told
you
such
nonsense
cabot
said
phronsie
she
told
me
this
morning
and
i

not
to
tell
you
polly
but
i
did
not
promise

what
perfect
nonsense
exclaimed
polly
recovering
herself
and
trying
to
laugh
well
phronsie
child
did
you
know
better
than
to
believe
any
story
that
cabot
might
tell
how
in
the
world
could
she
know
of
jasper
affairs
pray
tell
and
she
laughed
again
this
time
quite
gaily
ah

said
phronsie
shaking
her
head
she
had
a
letter
from
cabot
it
came
in
this
morning
mail
she
opened
it
and
said
out
loud

she
saw
me
and
she
said

and
rushed
down
the

phronsie
hurrying
after

polly
hoarsely
and
not

she
threw
wide
the

of

engaged
in

a

ambling
off
toward

stairs
and

cabot
in

pink
morning

down
the
hall
toward
polly
and
put

out
to
the
old
porch

polly
shook
herself

polly
she
added
desperately
and
i
wish

been
asleep
before
he
wrote
it
phronsie
oh

a
glass
of
water
be
quick
child
as
polly

on
the
old
stone
floor
of
the
porch
chapter
xxi
polly
tries
to
help
jasper
i
think
it
was
a
mean
shame
began
dick
wrathfully
dick
dick
exclaimed
his
mother
gently
whitney
tapped
his
knee
with
a
letter
he
had
just
placed
within
its
envelope
then
threw
it
on
the
table
it
the
best
job
i
ever
did
he
cried
jubilantly
to
get
jasper
out
of
that
business
dick
sent
his
two
hands
deep
within
their
pockets
oh
how
can
you
say
so
he
cried
and
how
can
you
question
what
your
father
does
exclaimed
whitney
why
that
is
like
you
dick
with
a
face
full
of
reproach
oh
let
the
boy
say
what
he
wants
to
marian
broke
in
her
husband
easily
so
dicky
my
lad
you
do
think
i
did
just
the
right
thing
for
jasper
eh
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
his
young
son
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
no
i
do
declared
dick
beginning
to
rage
up
and
down
the
room
on
young
indignant
feet
i
say
it
mean
to
meddle
with
a
business
i
would
stand
it
he
added
stoutly
whitney
laughed
long
and
loud
despite
his
wife
shocked
dicky
do
dear
well
if
i
did
know
that
in
a
year
time
jasper
will
come
to
me
and
say
thank
you
i
should
never
have
gone
through
with
the
job
in
the
world
said
his
father
when
he
came
out
of
his
amusement
it
the
pleasantest
piece
of
work
a
man
could
select
meddle
as
you
call
it
with
another
affairs
jasper
never
will
thank
you
in
the
world
never
exclaimed
dick
cramming
his
irritated
hands
deeper
in
their
pockets
and
turning
on
his
father
you
see
said
his
father
nodding
easily
and
you
see
papa
cried
dick
turning
hastily
in
front
of
him
looking
so
exactly
like
his
father
that
whitney
forgot
to
chide
in
admiring
them
both
and
i
think
it
too
bad
went
on
dick
everybody
pitches
into
jasper
and
wants
him
to
do
things
and
grandpapa
is
always
picking
at
him
i
i
fight
sometimes
he
added
softly
softly
there
my
boy
said
whitney
you
have
plenty
of
practice
for
all
your
fighting
powers
by
and
by
a
chap
does
know
everything
well
i
know
one
thing
declared
dick
more
positively
grandpapa
has
always
been
meddling
with
jasper
and
you
know
it
papa
that
because
he
expects
great
things
from
jasper
and
that
he
will
hold
up
the
king
name
we
all
do
replied
his
father
dick
turned
on
an
impatient
heel
and
so
he
would
have
done
if
let
him
be
a
publisher
he
declared
his
father
laughed
again
and
leaned
out
of
his
chair
to
pinch
his
ear
but
dick
resenting
this
indignity
retreated
to
a
safe
position
declaring
and
i
going
to
be
one
when
i
through
college
so
illustration
i
think
it
was
a
mean
shame
began
dick
wrathfully
king
down
the
road
and
mr
jasper
screamed
higby
coming
out
suddenly
to
the
porch
i
see
from
the
window
my
what
the
matter
with
miss
polly
nothing
said
polly
opening
her
eyes
that
is
not
much
and
sitting
up
straight
are
grandpapa
and
jasper
really
coming
she
asked
dear
me
polly
exclaimed
cabot
before
higby
could
answer
and
putting
shaking
hands
on
polly
shoulders
i
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
i
thought
your
arm
was
worse
and
you
so
near
well
o
dear
are
you
sure
you
are
right
peering
around
into
her
face
here
comes
phronsie
with
the
water
that
good
polly
took
the
glass
and
smiled
up
reassuringly
into
phronsie
troubled
face
oh
how
good
that
is
phronsie
she
cried
there
now
i
all
right
do
let
grandpapa
or
jasper
know
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
while
higby
hurried
off
to
see
if
her
preparations
for
dinner
were
all
right
now
that
king
had
come
back
a
day
sooner
than
he
wrote
he
intended
phronsie
you
go
and
meet
them
do
dear
begged
polly
and
as
phronsie
ran
off
obediently
polly
walked
up
and
down
the
porch
with
hasty
steps
holding
her
hands
as
tightly
locked
together
as
the
injured
arm
would
allow
oh
if
i
only
had
time
to
think
but
i
ought
to
try
even
if
i
do
say
just
exactly
the
right
words
for
marlowe
may
not
be
able
to
take
him
back
if
i
wait
and
then
grandpapa
came
hurrying
out
with
where
polly
and
she
was
kissed
and
her
cheeks
patted
he
not
seeming
to
notice
anything
amiss
in
her
he
was
so
glad
to
get
back
and
through
it
all
polly
saw
only
jasper
face
and
although
everything
seemed
to
turn
around
before
her
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
tell
grandpapa
just
what
she
thought
and
beg
him
to
change
his
mind
the
very
first
instant
she
could
and
so
before
the
first
greetings
of
the
homecoming
were
fairly
over
polly
afraid
her
courage
would
give
out
if
she
waited
a
moment
longer
put
her
hand
on
king
arm
what
is
it
dear
asked
the
old
gentleman
busy
with
phronsie
who
hung
around
his
neck
while
she
tried
to
tell
him
everything
that
had
happened
during
his
absence
and
he
peered
over
her
shoulder
into
polly
face
grandpapa
cried
polly
in
a
tremor
could
you
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
just
now
please
grandpapa
well
yes
dear
after
phronsie
has
oh
phronsie
will
wait
cried
polly
guilty
of
interrupting
i
know
she
will
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
phronsie
said
rebelliously
oh
i
want
to
wait
polly
dear
grandpapa
has
just
got
home
and
i
must
tell
him
things
so
you
shall
phronsie
declared
old
king
drawing
her
off
beyond
polly
reach
there
now
you
and
i
will
get
into
this
quiet
corner
and
he
sat
down
and
drew
phronsie
to
his
knee
now
pet
so
you
are
glad
to
get
your
old
grandpapa
home
eh
polly
in
an
agony
at
being
misunderstood
followed
and
without
stopping
to
think
she
threw
her
arms
around
phronsie
and
cried
o
phronsie
do
trust
me
dear
and
let
grandpapa
go
i
must
see
him
now
king
gave
polly
burning
cheeks
a
keen
glance
then
he
set
phronsie
on
the
floor
abruptly
phronsie
see
dear
polly
really
needs
me
come
child
and
he
gathered
up
polly
hand
into
his
own
and
marched
out
of
the
room
with
her
suppose
we
go
in
here
said
the
old
gentleman
and
have
our
talk
unceremoniously
opening
the
door
of
higby
best
room
as
he
spoke
nobody
is
likely
to
disturb
us
here
polly
not
caring
where
she
went
but
with
the
words
she
must
speak
weighing
heavily
on
her
mind
followed
him
unsteadily
into
the
parlor
and
while
he
threw
open
a
blind
or
two
to
light
up
the
gloom
that
usually
hung
over
higby
best
room
she
busied
herself
trying
to
think
how
she
should
begin
there
now
my
dear
said
king
coming
up
to
her
and
drawing
her
off
to
a
big
haircloth
sofa
standing
stiffly
against
the
wall
we
will
sit
down
here
and
then
we
can
go
over
it
comfortably
together
and
settle
what
is
on
your
mind
he
added
feeling
immensely
gratified
at
the
impending
confidence
grandpapa
cried
polly
in
desperation
and
springing
from
the
sofa
where
he
had
placed
her
by
his
side
to
stand
in
front
of
him
i
know
where
to
begin
oh
do
help
me
she
clasped
her
hands
and
stood
the
picture
of
distress
unable
to
say
another
word
why
how
can
i
help
you
to
tell
me
child
cried
old
king
in
astonishment
when
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
it
is
you
want
to
say
oh
i
know
it
cried
polly
twisting
her
hands
unable
to
hold
them
quite
still
o
dear
what
shall
i
do
grandpapa
it
just
well
what
my
dear
asked
the
old
gentleman
and
taking
one
of
her
hands
encouragingly
are
you
afraid
of
me
why
polly
polly
started
at
his
tone
of
reproach
and
threw
her
well
arm
around
his
neck
exactly
as
phronsie
would
have
done
which
so
pleased
the
old
gentleman
that
it
was
easier
for
her
to
begin
again
to
tell
him
what
was
on
her
mind
but
when
she
had
gotten
as
far
as
it
just
this
she
stopped
again
well
now
polly
said
king
sitting
straight
on
the
sofa
with
displeasure
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
at
you
i
should
never
think
this
was
you
polly
never
in
all
the
world
which
so
unnerved
her
that
she
plunged
at
once
into
what
she
had
set
herself
to
do
saying
the
most
dreadful
thing
that
was
possible
o
grandpapa
she
cried
do
you
think
it
can
be
right
to
take
jasper
away
from
his
work
well
i
must
say
polly
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
in
the
greatest
displeasure
and
rising
abruptly
from
the
sofa
brushing
her
aside
as
he
did
so
that
i
never
have
been
so
surprised
in
my
life
as
to
have
you
come
to
teach
me
my
duty
right
of
course
it
is
it
must
be
if
i
wish
it
i
have
always
looked
out
for
jasper
good
with
that
he
walked
up
and
down
the
parlor
fuming
at
every
step
and
looking
so
very
dreadful
that
polly
rooted
to
the
spot
had
only
to
stand
still
and
watch
him
in
despair
if
you
could
have
seen
jasper
the
way
he
was
when
i
found
him
said
king
tired
at
last
of
vituperating
and
coming
up
to
polly
sternly
you
would
be
glad
to
have
me
get
him
out
of
the
wretched
business
it
smelt
so
of
trade
and
everybody
was
grossly
familiar
while
that
marlowe
i
have
no
words
for
him
polly
he
insulted
me
oh
oh
cried
polly
with
clasped
hands
and
flaming
cheeks
how
could
he
grandpapa
jasper
has
always
said
he
was
such
a
gentleman
jasper
ideas
of
what
a
gentleman
should
be
and
mine
are
very
different
exploded
the
old
gentleman
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
the
parlor
again
i
tell
you
polly
that
my
boy
is
sadly
changed
since
he
went
into
that
contemptible
trade
but
jasper
loves
his
work
mourned
polly
her
color
dying
down
loves
his
work
well
he
should
cried
king
in
extreme
irritation
it
no
sort
of
a
work
for
him
to
love
brought
up
as
he
has
been
a
profession
is
the
only
thing
for
him
now
he
studies
law
o
grandpapa
cried
polly
quite
white
now
and
she
precipitated
herself
in
front
of
the
old
gentleman
angry
feet
jasper
just
hates
the
law
i
know
for
he
has
often
said
so
and
if
you
do
fasten
him
down
all
his
life
to
what
he
do
like
and
make
him
be
a
lawyer
it
will
kill
him
he
do
it
grandpapa
polly
rushed
on
regardless
of
the
lightning
gleam
of
anger
in
the
sharp
eyes
above
her
and
although
she
knew
that
after
this
she
should
never
be
the
same
polly
to
him
as
of
old
she
kept
on
steadily
because
you
want
him
to
he
do
anything
to
please
you
and
make
you
happy
grandpapa
and
he
wo
say
anything
but
it
will
kill
him
it
surely
will
for
he
loves
his
work
with
marlowe
so
then
polly
stopped
aghast
at
the
effect
of
her
words
and
what
am
i
to
do
now
pray
to
please
you
asked
old
king
and
drawing
off
to
look
at
her
quite
coldly
oh
nothing
to
please
me
cried
poor
polly
only
for
jasper
do
let
him
go
back
to
marlowe
grandpapa
he
shall
never
go
back
to
marlowe
with
my
consent
declared
the
old
gentleman
stiffly
his
anger
rising
again
and
you
have
displeased
me
very
much
polly
pepper
by
all
this
now
you
may
go
and
remember
not
another
word
about
jasper
and
his
work
i
will
arrange
everything
concerning
him
without
interference
and
polly
not
knowing
how
crept
out
of
higby
parlor
and
shut
the
door
illustration
oh
why
did
i
speak
cried
polly
over
and
over
polly
somebody
called
as
she
hurried
on
unsteady
feet
over
the
stairs
to
her
own
little
room
that
she
had
begged
under
the
farmhouse
eaves
but
she
did
even
answer
only
rushed
on
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
then
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
this
was
worse
than
the
day
so
long
ago
when
she
sat
in
the
old
in
the
little
brown
house
with
eyes
bound
closely
to
shut
out
all
outside
things
and
all
of
them
had
been
afraid
she
was
going
to
be
blind
for
now
she
felt
sure
that
she
had
spoiled
whatever
chance
there
might
have
been
for
jasper
oh
why
did
i
speak
why
did
i
she
cried
over
and
over
in
her
distress
as
she
buried
her
face
deeper
yet
in
higby
gay
patch
bedquilt
after
a
while
polly
never
could
tell
how
long
she
had
staid
there
somebody
rapped
at
the
door
it
was
phronsie
and
she
cried
in
a
grieved
little
voice
polly
are
you
here
i
been
under
the
and
just
everywhere
for
you
do
let
me
in
i
ca
now
pet
cried
polly
trying
not
to
let
her
voice
sound
choked
with
tears
you
run
away
dear
polly
will
let
you
in
by
and
by
are
you
sick
polly
cried
phronsie
anxiously
and
kneeling
down
to
put
her
mouth
to
the
keyhole
no
not
a
bit
said
polly
hastily
and
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
really
polly
really
and
truly
phronsie
there
run
away
dear
if
you
love
me
phronsie
at
this
unwillingly
crept
off
and
still
polly
knelt
on
with
the
wild
remorse
tugging
at
her
heart
that
she
had
been
the
one
to
injure
jasper
prospects
for
life
and
then
the
rang
and
polly
who
was
never
known
to
be
late
at
a
meal
heard
higby
come
out
into
the
hall
again
and
shake
the
big
bell
till
it
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
farmhouse
with
its
noise
oh
i
ca
go
down
i
ca
moaned
poor
polly
to
herself
quite
lost
to
everything
but
the
dreadful
distress
at
the
mischief
she
had
wrought
and
then
phronsie
came
again
this
time
imploring
with
tears
for
polly
felt
quite
sure
that
she
could
hear
her
crying
that
polly
would
only
open
the
door
and
let
me
see
you
just
once
polly
and
even
cabot
came
and
polly
thought
she
should
go
wild
to
have
her
stand
outside
there
and
beg
and
insist
that
polly
should
come
down
to
them
all
illustration
are
you
sick
polly
cried
phronsie
anxiously
i
do
want
any
dinner
said
polly
over
and
over
i
just
must
be
alone
a
little
while
and
at
last
she
spoke
quickly
to
persistent
pleadings
have
the
goodness
cabot
not
to
call
me
again
and
then
she
was
sorry
the
minute
she
had
spoken
the
words
and
she
opened
her
door
a
little
crack
to
call
after
cabot
as
she
sailed
downstairs
in
great
displeasure
oh
do
forgive
me
dear
cabot
for
speaking
so
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
can
not
come
down
just
yet
i
shall
send
you
up
your
dinner
then
said
cabot
only
half
appeased
and
pausing
on
the
stairs
no
no
begged
polly
and
she
seemed
so
distressed
at
the
mere
thought
that
cabot
unwillingly
let
her
have
her
way
about
it
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
polly
exhausted
by
weeping
had
fallen
asleep
just
where
she
was
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
her
head
on
the
gay
bedquilt
when
a
low
knock
on
the
door
startled
her
and
made
her
rub
her
eyes
and
listen
polly
said
a
voice
it
was
jasper
wo
you
undo
the
door
i
want
to
speak
to
you
o
jasper
cried
polly
springing
to
her
feet
and
running
over
to
the
door
i
ca
do
ask
me
not
just
yet
i
wo
ask
you
again
said
jasper
if
you
do
wish
it
polly
his
voice
showed
his
disappointment
and
polly
full
of
dismay
at
the
trouble
she
had
made
for
him
could
find
it
in
her
heart
to
cause
him
this
new
worry
you
wo
want
to
speak
to
me
jasper
she
cried
unlocking
the
door
with
trembling
fingers
when
you
know
what
i
have
done
what
polly
he
cried
trying
not
to
show
how
he
felt
at
sight
of
the
swollen
eyelids
and
downcast
face
meanwhile
he
drew
her
out
gently
into
the
hall
there
let
us
sit
down
here
pausing
before
the
wide
it
quiet
here
and
nobody
will
be
likely
to
come
here
he
waited
till
polly
sat
down
then
made
a
place
for
himself
beside
her
jasper
cried
polly
lifting
her
brown
eyes
now
filling
with
tears
again
you
ca
think
what
i
done
i
ruined
your
whole
life
for
you
how
polly
jasper
face
grew
pale
to
his
lips
oh
do
tell
me
at
once
yet
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
what
she
was
about
to
say
o
jasper
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
help
you
i
never
knew
till
this
morning
just
before
you
came
that
you
had
lost
your
place
cabot
had
a
letter
from
her
husband
and
she
told
me
and
i
spoke
to
grandpapa
and
begged
him
to
let
you
go
back
and
o
jasper
here
polly
tears
despite
all
her
efforts
to
keep
them
back
fell
in
a
shower
you
guess
how
dreadfully
grandpapa
feels
and
he
says
oh
he
says
that
you
are
to
study
law
and
never
never
go
back
to
mr
marlowe
is
that
all
exclaimed
jasper
in
such
a
tone
of
relief
that
polly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stared
at
him
through
dry
eyes
all
she
gasped
o
jasper
i
thought
you
loved
your
work
chapter
xxii
mr
king
and
polly
so
i
do
love
my
work
cried
jasper
in
a
glow
but
polly
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
walked
away
so
that
she
could
see
his
face
i
thought
that
you
were
going
to
say
something
about
yourself
then
he
turned
around
and
faced
her
again
o
jasper
exclaimed
polly
reproachfully
what
could
i
possibly
have
to
say
about
myself
how
can
i
think
of
anything
when
you
are
in
trouble
forgive
me
polly
broke
in
jasper
eagerly
and
he
took
her
hand
and
do
worry
about
me
i
mean
do
think
that
what
you
said
to
grandpapa
made
any
difference
but
indeed
it
did
jasper
declared
polly
truthfully
oh
i
know
it
did
and
i
have
done
it
all
polly
polly
begged
jasper
in
great
distress
do
dear
and
now
you
must
give
it
all
up
and
go
into
the
law
oh
the
horrid
hateful
law
oh
what
will
you
do
jasper
and
she
gazed
up
into
his
face
pityingly
i
shall
have
to
go
said
jasper
drawing
his
breath
hard
and
looking
at
her
steadily
you
know
you
yourself
told
me
long
ago
to
make
my
father
happy
any
way
polly
he
smiled
as
he
emphasized
the
last
word
oh
i
know
cried
polly
in
despair
but
i
did
think
it
could
ever
be
anything
as
bad
as
this
jasper
way
means
pretty
hard
lines
sometimes
polly
said
jasper
well
there
no
help
for
it
now
so
you
must
help
me
to
go
through
with
it
and
just
think
mourned
polly
looking
as
if
the
shower
were
about
to
fall
again
how
i
made
it
worse
for
you
with
grandpapa
o
jasper
i
shall
never
be
any
help
to
you
polly
exclaimed
jasper
in
such
a
tone
that
she
stopped
to
look
at
him
in
astonishment
there
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
added
with
his
usual
manner
and
sitting
down
beside
her
again
and
then
you
see
that
nothing
on
earth
made
any
difference
to
father
this
was
the
way
of
it
and
jasper
proceeded
to
lay
before
her
every
detail
of
king
visit
to
him
and
all
the
circumstances
at
the
store
not
omitting
whitney
part
in
the
affair
as
shown
by
the
letter
that
jasper
had
seen
oh
oh
how
mean
interrupted
polly
at
this
point
with
flashing
brown
eyes
how
could
he
and
her
lips
curled
disdainfully
oh
mason
thought
he
was
doing
me
the
greatest
favor
in
the
world
i
do
doubt
answered
jasper
you
know
polly
he
never
could
bear
to
hear
of
the
publishing
business
and
he
was
so
disappointed
when
i
would
go
into
the
law
i
know
said
polly
but
this
was
dreadful
to
meddle
after
you
had
once
decided
very
very
dreadful
i
think
so
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
feeling
surprisingly
it
was
so
beautiful
to
be
talking
it
all
over
with
polly
but
the
trouble
is
mason
do
well
and
then
came
that
dreadful
misunderstanding
about
marlowe
that
hurt
me
worse
than
all
o
polly
if
you
only
knew
the
man
and
jasper
relapsed
into
gloom
once
more
o
dear
dear
cried
polly
sympathetically
and
clasping
her
hands
what
can
we
do
is
there
anything
to
do
no
said
jasper
absolutely
nothing
when
father
once
makes
up
his
mind
about
anything
it
made
up
for
all
time
i
must
just
lose
the
friendship
of
that
man
as
well
as
my
place
with
that
his
gloom
deepened
and
polly
feeling
powerless
to
utter
a
word
slipped
her
hand
within
his
as
it
lay
on
his
knee
he
looked
up
and
smiled
gratefully
you
see
polly
we
ca
say
anything
to
him
oh
no
no
cried
polly
in
horror
at
the
mere
thought
i
only
made
it
a
great
deal
worse
no
you
have
made
it
worse
dear
but
we
should
do
any
good
to
talk
to
him
about
it
i
do
believe
i
could
live
cried
polly
off
her
guard
to
have
him
look
at
me
and
to
hear
him
speak
so
again
jasper
jasper
started
while
a
frown
spread
over
his
face
i
can
bear
anything
but
that
you
should
be
hurt
polly
he
exclaimed
his
fingers
tightening
over
hers
oh
i
do
mind
it
so
much
cried
polly
recovering
herself
hastily
if
i
had
made
mischief
for
you
and
that
you
never
must
think
of
again
promise
me
polly
i
try
not
to
said
polly
you
must
just
put
the
notion
out
of
your
mind
whenever
it
comes
in
said
jasper
decidedly
you
promise
that
polly
i
know
you
will
well
said
polly
reluctantly
i
will
jasper
all
right
exclaimed
jasper
in
great
satisfaction
polly
polly
phronsie
yellow
head
came
up
above
the
stairs
and
presently
phronsie
came
running
up
to
them
in
great
haste
o
polly
and
she
threw
her
arms
hungrily
around
polly
and
hugged
her
closely
o
dear
letting
her
arms
fall
i
was
to
stop
a
minute
grandpapa
wants
you
to
drive
with
him
polly
and
you
are
to
go
right
down
as
soon
as
you
get
your
hat
on
grandpapa
screamed
polly
jumping
off
from
the
so
hastily
that
phronsie
nearly
fell
over
while
jasper
was
hardly
less
excited
why
phronsie
you
ca
mean
it
he
father
really
wants
you
polly
i
know
broke
in
jasper
with
a
look
into
the
brown
eyes
but
his
voice
shook
and
if
phronsie
had
been
so
worried
over
polly
she
would
certainly
have
noticed
it
polly
has
had
any
dinner
she
said
in
a
troubled
way
oh
i
do
care
for
dinner
cried
polly
with
another
look
at
jasper
and
beginning
to
dance
off
to
her
room
for
her
hat
but
you
must
have
some
declared
phronsie
in
gentle
authority
going
toward
the
stairs
and
i
shall
just
ask
grandpapa
to
wait
for
you
to
get
it
higby
saved
your
dinner
for
you
polly
oh
i
could
eat
a
morsel
protested
polly
from
her
little
room
and
do
ask
grandpapa
to
wait
an
instant
whatever
you
do
phronsie
see
i
ready
and
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
putting
on
her
hat
as
she
spoke
get
her
a
glass
of
milk
phronsie
called
jasper
standing
by
the
that
a
good
child
polly
flashed
him
a
grateful
look
as
she
dashed
down
the
stairs
drawing
on
her
gloves
and
not
daring
to
look
forward
to
meeting
grandpapa
but
when
she
came
out
to
the
back
piazza
phronsie
following
her
with
the
glass
and
begging
her
to
drink
up
the
rest
left
in
it
old
king
standing
by
the
little
chaise
received
her
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
well
i
declare
polly
he
said
turning
to
her
with
a
smile
i
never
saw
anybody
get
ready
so
quickly
as
you
can
there
hop
in
child
and
he
put
aside
her
dress
from
the
wheel
in
his
most
courtly
manner
possible
polly
has
had
all
the
milk
said
phronsie
by
the
holding
up
the
glass
anxiously
well
i
do
believe

old
king

from
the
depths
of
the
old
chaise
i
could
drink
it
dear
king
bent
his
white
head
to
kiss
phronsie
and
then
they
drove
away
and
left
her
standing
in
the
path
her
glass
in
her
hand
and
looking
after
them
all
sorts
of
things
king
talked
of
in
the
cheeriest
manner
possible
just
as
if
polly
and
he
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
a
drive
like
this
every
morning
and
he
never
seemed
to
notice
her
swollen
eyelids
or
whether
she
answered
but
kept
on
bravely
with
the
conversation
at
last
polly
at
something
he
said
laughed
in
her
old
merry
fashion
then
king
drew
a
long
breath
and
relaxed
his
efforts
i
declare
polly
he
said
leaning
back
in
a
comfortable
way
against
the
old
cushion
and
allowing
the
neighbor
horse
hired
for
the
occasion
to
amble
along
in
its
own
fashion
now
we
are
so
cosy
i
believe
i
tell
you
a
secret
polly
stopped
laughing
and
gazed
at
him
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
little
journey
just
you
and
i
he
asked
looking
down
into
her
face
a
journey
grandpapa
asked
polly
wonderingly
yes
about
as
far
as
well
to
the
place
where
jasper
has
been
all
winter
the
fact
is
polly
went
on
king
very
rapidly
as
if
with
the
fear
that
if
he
stopped
he
would
not
be
able
to
finish
at
all
i
want
you
to
look
over
the
ground
jasper
work
i
mean
it
seems
an
abominable
place
to
me
a
perfectly
abominable
one
confided
the
old
gentleman
in
a
burst
of
feeling
but
there
pulling
himself
up
maybe
i
not
the
one
to
say
it
you
see
polly
i
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
in
my
life
and
i
really
ca
tell
how
ought
to
look
and
i
suppose
a
working
man
like
marlowe
might
be
different
from
me
and
yet
be
a
decent
sort
of
a
person
after
all
well
will
you
go
he
asked
abruptly
o
grandpapa
cried
polly
aghast
and
turning
in
the
chaise
to
look
at
him
with
wide
eyes
yes
i
really
mean
it
nodded
old
king
in
his
most
decided
fashion
although
i
do
blame
you
for
thinking
me
funny
child
i
was
only
thinking
how
good
you
are
grandpapa
exclaimed
polly
fervently
and
creeping
up
close
to
his
side
there
there
polly
child
said
the
old
gentleman
no
more
of
that
else
we
shall
have
a
scene
and
that
what
i
never
did
like
dear
you
know
well
will
you
go
with
me
you
have
said
yes
yet
oh
yes
yes
yes
cried
polly
in
a
rapturous
shout
not
taking
her
glowing
eyes
off
from
his
face
take
care
you
scare
the
natives
warned
old
king
beaming
at
her
brierly
folks
could
have
any
such
transports
polly
as
they
turned
down
a
shady
lane
and
ambled
by
a
quiet
farmhouse
well
they
ought
to
replied
polly
merrily
peering
out
at
the
still
big
house
o
grandpapa
i
just
want
to
get
out
and
jump
and
scream
i
do
feel
any
bigger
than
phronsie
well
i
much
rather
have
you
here
in
this
carriage
with
me
said
the
old
gentleman
composedly
now
that
settled
that
we
are
going
polly
of
course
i
asked
the
doctor
i
sent
down
a
letter
to
him
after
dinner
to
ask
if
your
arm
would
let
you
take
a
little
journey
with
me
and
of
course
he
said
like
a
sensible
man
why
should
he
pray
tell
when
we
were
all
going
home
in
a
day
or
two
now
of
course
that
must
be
postponed
a
bit
never
mind
polly
hastened
to
say
if
jasper
is
only
fixed
up
now
polly
king
shifted
his
position
a
bit
so
that
he
might
see
her
the
better
perhaps
marlowe
wo
take
jasper
back
judging
from
what
i
know
of
the
man
i
do
think
he
will
and
the
old
gentleman
face
despite
his
extreme
care
began
to
look
troubled
at
once
oh
maybe
he
will
cried
polly
warmly
grandpapa
i
should
wonder
at
all
he
must
she
added
positively
i
do
know
polly
he
said
in
a
worried
way
i
think
it
very
doubtful
indeed
from
what
i
know
of
business
now
i
do
believe
at
all
that
he
will
but
then
we
can
try
oh
we
can
try
echoed
polly
hopefully
and
feeling
as
if
since
god
was
good
he
would
let
jasper
back
into
his
chosen
well
we
start
early
morning
on
our
little
trip
polly
said
the
old
gentleman
catching
her
infectious
spirit
and
giving
the
old
horse
a
fillip
with
the
whip
meantime
not
a
word
my
dear
of
our
little
plan
so
polly
promised
the
deepest
secrecy
and
that
no
one
should
even
have
a
hint
from
her
looks
of
what
grandpapa
and
she
were
to
do
and
the
next
morning
although
everybody
was
nearly
devoured
by
curiosity
no
one
dared
to
ask
questions
so
old
king
and
polly
with
two
portmanteaus
departed
for
a
journey
of
apparently
a
few
days
and
polly
did
dare
to
trust
herself
alone
with
jasper
but
ran
a
race
with
him
around
all
the
angles
of
the
old
farmhouse
always
cleverly
disappearing
with
a
merry
laugh
when
there
was
the
least
chance
of
his
overtaking
her
and
cornering
her
for
an
explanation
and
pickering
dodge
in
his
invalid
chair
drawn
close
to
the
window
heard
the
merry
preparations
for
the
journey
and
fretfully
declared
that
people
seem
to
be
happy
with
never
a
thought
for
a
poor
dog
like
me
while
old
loughead
who
despite
doctor
bryce
verdict
had
never
seemed
quite
well
enough
in
his
own
estimation
for
his
departure
from
the
higby
hospital
on
the
contrary
brightened
up
exclaiming
now
that
is
something
like
to
hear
miss
polly
laugh
like
that
bless
her
pickering
said
polly
coming
into
his
room
old
king
close
behind
i
am
going
away
with
grandpapa
for
a
day
or
two
and
she
came
up
in
her
traveling
hat
and
gown
close
to
his
chair
so
i
heard
said
pickering
lifting
his
pale
face
and
trying
to
seem
glad
for
polly
joy
was
bubbling
over
but
he
made
rather
a
poor
show
of
it
to
you
my
boy
said
king
laying
a
soft
palm
over
the
thin
fingers
on
pickering
knee
now
see
that
you
get
up
a
little
more
vigor
by
the
time
we
are
back
goodness
all
you
want
is
a
trifle
more
backbone
why
an
old
fellow
like
me
would
beat
you
there
i
do
believe
i
am
surprised
at
you
cried
the
old
gentleman
shaking
his
fingers
at
loughead
with
whom
he
was
on
the
best
of
terms
but
never
feeling
the
necessity
to
weigh
his
words
that
you
being
chief
nurse
set
up
with
that
boy
and
make
him
get
on
his
feet
quicker
so
i
could
do
cried
old
loughead
whose
chief
object
in
life
since
pickering
had
been
pronounced
out
of
danger
had
been
to
browbeat
the
trained
nurse
and
usurp
the
authority
in
pickering
if
cabot
would
keep
out
or
take
it
into
her
head
to
return
home
to
state
it
mildly
continued
the
old
gentleman
not
lowering
his
tone
in
the
least
that
lady
does
seem
to
be
gifted
with
the
qualities
of
a
nurse
providence
never
intended
that
she
should
be
one
in
my
opinion
do
tell
him
to
bully
me
worse
than
he
does
cried
pickering
he
shows
a
frightful
hand
when
he
wants
his
own
way
that
it
cried
old
king
delightedly
only
just
keep
it
up
you
get
well
fast
as
long
as
you
can
fight
come
on
polly
my
girl
or
we
shall
be
late
for
the
train
the
evening
before
jack
loughead
ran
up
the
steps
to
miss
select
school
for
young
ladies
and
pulled
the
bell
hastily
amy
ran
down
as
quickly
to
the
little
room
where
she
was
always
allowed
to
see
her
brother
well
amy
child
cried
jack
when
they
had
gone
through
with
the
preliminaries
always
religiously
observed
on
his
visits
how
she
had
progressed
in
her
music
under
the
new
teacher
miss
pepper
had
recommended
during
her
enforced
absence
and
how
far
she
had
pleased
miss
salisbury
and
all
the
other
things
an
elder
brother
who
had
come
to
his
conscience
rather
late
would
be
apt
to
look
into
and
so
you
really
think
you
are
getting
on
in
your
practice
o
yes
jack
cried
amy
confidently
come
and
see
i
a
new
beethoven
for
you
and
she
laid
hold
of
his
arm
with
eager
fingers
now
you
be
immensely
surprised
jack
immensely
no
doubt
no
doubt
answered
jack
hastily
and
not
offering
to
get
up
from
the
sofa
but
you
need
play
it
now
why
jack
cried
amy
no
little
offended
what
the
matter
asked
me
regularly
to
play
you
my
pieces
and
now
when
i
offer
to
you
wo
have
any
of
it
and
she
began
to
pout
that
shabby
in
me
declared
jack
with
remorse
and
getting
off
the
sofa
to
his
feet
he
dutifully
spread
the
music
on
the
rack
and
paid
his
little
sister
such
attention
that
she
was
soon
smilingly
launched
into
the
new
piece
and
lost
to
everything
else
but
her
own
melody
that
fine
pronounced
jack
as
amy
declared
herself
through
and
whirled
around
on
the
for
his
applause
but
his
heart
in
it
and
amy
blue
eyes
soon
found
it
out
you
not
a
bit
like
yourself
brother
jack
she
cried
with
another
pout
and
staring
at
him
you
right
i
not
amy
declared
jack
come
over
to
the
sofa
and
i
tell
you
about
it
so
the
two
turned
their
backs
on
the
piano
and
pretty
soon
amy
her
hand
in
her
brother
big
brown
palm
was
nestled
up
against
him
and
hearing
a
confidence
that
made
her
small
soul
swell
with
delight
amy
said
jack
putting
his
arm
closer
around
her
when
miss
pepper
had
the
courage
to
tell
me
of
my
duty
to
you
i
made
up
my
mind
that
you
should
never
want
for
anything
that
my
hand
could
supply
and
i
never
have
cried
little
amy
poking
her
head
up
from
its
nest
to
look
at
him
all
the
girls
say
you
are
just
splendid
to
me
that
they
never
saw
such
a
brother
and
i
do
believe
they
ever
did
jack
she
added
proudly
so
now
what
i
am
about
to
do
said
jack
speaking
with
great
effort
is
to
bring
anything
but
the
greatest
happiness
to
you
amy
as
well
as
to
me
if
only
i
can
secure
it
he
added
under
his
breath
what
are
you
going
to
do
jack
demanded
amy
springing
away
from
him
to
stare
into
his
bronzed
face
oh
i
know
you
are
going
to
europe
again
and
will
take
me
this
time
oh
goody
goody
she
screamed
like
a
child
clapping
her
hands
gaily
hush
amy
cried
jack
trying
to
speak
lightly
or
miss
salisbury
will
come
in
and
send
me
off
saying
i
spoil
your
manners
there
come
back
here
to
me
i
can
talk
better
then
and
he
drew
her
to
his
side
again
no
it
is
something
much
more
beautiful
than
any
trip
to
europe
would
be
it
ca
be
jack
cried
amy
positively
and
burrowing
her
sunny
head
into
his
waistcoat
illustration
amy
listen
and
do
interrupt
again
said
her
big
brother
amy
how
can
i
tell
it
amy
if
miss
pepper
will
will
marry
me
i
will
bless
god
all
my
life
this
time
amy
sprang
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
miss
small
marry
you
brother
jack
she
screamed
oh
how
perfectly
elegant
it
too
lovely
for
anything
oh
my
darling
miss
pepper
and
so
on
till
jack
could
make
her
hear
a
word
amy
amy
at
last
he
said
getting
up
to
her
to
lay
an
imperative
hand
on
her
arm
what
would
miss
pepper
say
do
get
so
excitable
child
to
see
you
now
do
hush
i
know
it
said
amy
stopping
instantly
and
creeping
humbly
back
to
the
sofa
miss
pepper
was
always
telling
me
how
to
stop
screaming
at
everything
i
liked
and
not
to
cry
at
things
i
did
like
she
confessed
frankly
well
then
if
you
love
her
said
jack
going
back
to
sit
down
by
her
again
you
will
try
to
do
what
she
says
and
you
do
love
her
i
am
quite
sure
amy
i
love
her
so
declared
amy
that
i
would
do
any
and
everything
she
ever
asked
me
to
brother
jack
i
thought
so
said
jack
well
now
amy
i
must
tell
you
that
i
went
to
see
fisher
to
ask
her
if
i
may
speak
to
miss
pepper
and
she
gives
me
full
permission
and
so
i
shall
go
to
brierly
and
try
my
fate
it
wo
be
any
trying
at
all
cried
amy
superbly
and
stretching
her
neck
to
look
up
with
immense
pride
at
her
tall
brother
she
ca
help
loving
you
jack
oh
i
am
so
happy
jack
loughead
dark
face
had
a
grave
look
on
it
as
he
glanced
down
at
her
i
hope
so
he
said
simply
chapter
xxiii
that
settles
many
things
it
perfectly
dreadful
cried
alexia
rhys
wrinkling
her
brows
to
try
to
get
up
anything
with
polly
away
if
we
only
had
joel
to
help
us
that
would
be
something
well
it
got
to
be
done
said
clem
forsythe
in
a
way
of
course
it
has
cried
alexia
gustily
dear
me
in
a
tone
of
horror
did
you
suppose
that
we
let
polly
pepper
go
on
year
after
year
getting
up
perfectly
elegant
things
for
us
and
then
we
not
celebrate
for
her
when
she
comes
home
and
with
a
broken
arm
too
the
idea
clem
well
then
i
think
we
much
better
set
to
work
to
think
up
something
observed
clem
wisely
if
we
are
going
to
do
anything
we
ca
think
of
a
single
thing
not
one
bemoaned
alexia
it
will
be
a
perfectly
horrid
fright
whatever
we
get
up
oh
dear
what
shall
we
do
girls
alexia
you
are
enough
to
drive
anybody
wild
cried
sally
moore
bad
enough
to
know
there
is
an
idea
in
all
our
heads
put
together
without
having
you
tell
us
of
it
every
minute
cathie
harrison
why
do
you
say
something
instead
of
staring
that
wall
out
of
countenance
because
i
have
anything
to
say
replied
cathie
laughing
grimly
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
resignedly
oh
dear
i
think
just
as
alexia
does
it
will
be
utterly
horrid
whatever
we
do
do
you
be
a
wet
blanket
cried
two
or
three
of
the
girls
if
alexia
is
oh
dear
miss
chatterton
you
are
the
only
one
of
sense
in
this
company
now
do
give
us
an
idea
added
one
i
do
know
in
the
least
how
to
help
said
charlotte
chatterton
slowly
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
knees
she
rested
her
head
in
her
hands
i
never
got
up
a
play
or
tableau
nor
anything
of
the
kind
in
my
life
and
we
never
celebrated
anything
either
there
was
never
anything
to
celebrate
but
i
should
think
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
try
to
do
great
things
why
miss
chatterton
exclaimed
alexia
rhys
in
great
disapproval
and
starting
forward
in
the
pretty
basket
chair
i
perfectly
surprised
at
you
nothing
can
be
too
good
for
polly
pepper
we
must
get
up
something
perfectly
magnificent
or
else
i
shall
die
she
cried
tragically
nothing
can
be
too
good
for
polly
repeated
charlotte
taking
her
head
out
of
her
hands
and
looking
at
alexia
but
is
it
better
not
to
try
to
be
too
grand
and
have
something
simple
because
whatever
we
do
polly
must
always
have
had
things
so
much
nicer
in
other
words
it
better
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
than
to
shoot
at
the
clouds
and
bring
down
nothing
said
clem
sententiously
yes
yes
i
think
so
cried
cathie
clapping
her
hands
it
awfully
vulgar
to
try
to
cut
a
dash
that
is
if
you
ca
do
it
she
added
quickly

nothing
can
be
too
good
for
polly
pepper
cried
alexia
starting
forward
do
say
corrected
alexia
readjusting
herself
in
her
chair
well
i
suppose
you
are
right
miss
chatterton
you
always
right
being
as
i
said
a
person
of
sense
charlotte
gave
a
short
laugh
but
with
a
little
bitter
edge
to
it
why
would
the
girls
who
now
seemed
to
be
so
glad
to
have
her
in
the
center
of
all
their
plans
persist
in
calling
her
miss
chatterton
it
gave
her
a
chill
every
time
and
she
fairly
hated
the
name
and
now
since
we
are
going
to
follow
your
advice
went
on
alexia
be
so
good
as
to
tell
us
a
little
bit
more
now
what
shall
we
do
in
the
way
of
a
simple
appropriate
fandango
a
perfect
idyl
of
a
thing
you
know
well
said
charlotte
quietly
you
know
in
the
olden
time
at
christmas
but
this
is
christmas
cried
alexia
interrupting
with
an
uneasy
gesture
do
be
still
cried
the
other
girls
pulling
at
her
and
let
miss
chatterton
finish
at
christmas
ages
ago
when
special
honor
was
done
to
entertain
the
king
wherever
he
was
lodged
went
on
charlotte
there
was
a
lord
of
misrule
who
gathered
together
a
company
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
rummaged
the
old
castles
for
grotesque
costumes
and
furbelows
and
then
masked
they
all
came
in
and
marched
before
the
king
and
danced
oh
everything
we
might
have
minuets
and
highland
flings
and
all
the
rest
and
they
did
everything
the
lord
of
misrule
directed
and
charlotte
chatterton
you
are
a
jewel
cried
alexia
tumbling
out
of
her
chair
and
flying
at
her
which
example
was
followed
by
all
the
other
girls
thank
you
cried
charlotte
with
glistening
eyes
thank
you
i
guess
we
do
thank
you
cried
sally
moore
heartily
for
getting
us
out
of
this
scrape
oh
i
do
mean
that
said
charlotte
indifferently
i
mean
because
you
called
me
by
my
first
name
the
same
as
you
girls
always
talk
to
each
other
there
was
a
little
pause
oh
we
did
know
as
you
like
it
broke
in
alexia
hastily
you
are
so
tall
and
you
never
seem
in
a
hurry
nor
as
if
you
cared
a
straw
about
being
like
a
girl
and
we
did
dare
but
now
oh
charlotte
charlotte
and
she
gave
her
a
hug
that
well
repaid
charlotte
for
all
the
past
that
a
regular
she
cried
at
last
releasing
her
and
taking
a
long
breath
and
equal
to
a
few
dozen
common
ones
if
charlotte
can
breathe
after
that
said
clem
turning
on
charlotte
a
pair
of
glowing
eyes
she
do
well
we
are
just
as
glad
to
call
you
charlotte
are
we
girls
whirling
around
on
the
group
as
alexia
for
all
her
yes
yes
cried
the
whole
bevy
well
now
girls
said
alexia
running
over
to
give
clem
a
small
shake
let
to
business
there
is
any
time
to
waste
charlotte
chatterton
will
you
tell
us
the
rest
of
it
and
who
will
be
the
lord
of
misrule
dear
me
if
we
only
had
joel
here
i
think
doctor
fisher
would
be
the
lord
of
misrule
said
charlotte
he
said
he
do
anything
we
wanted
of
him
to
help
out
the
girls
one
and
all
gave
a
small
howl
and
clapped
their
hands
crying
capital
capital
let
go
and
ask
him
now
cried
alexia
who
was
anything
if
not
energetic
and
running
to
her
closet
she
picked
off
her
hat
from
the
shelf
and
tossed
it
on
her
head
oh
how
slow
you
are
girls
do
hurry
as
the
others
flew
to
the
bed
where
their
different
had
been
thrown
but
it
his
office
hours
said
charlotte
hating
in
her
happiness
at
being
one
with
the
girls
to
put
a
damper
on
their
plan
bother
supposing
it
is
exclaimed
alexia
in
front
of
her
draped
mirror
while
she
ran
the
long
hat
pins
through
her
fluffy
hair
it
as
important
to
take
care
of
us
girls
as
if
we
were
a
lot
of
patients
we
shall
be
if
we
do
get
this
fixed
come
on
girls
she
seized
a
lace
scarf
from
some
mysterious
corner
and
pranced
to
the
door
shaking
her
gloves
at
the
group
i
do
think
we
ought
to
go
now
said
charlotte
distinctly
not
offering
to
join
the
merry
scramble
for
the
wearing
apparel
on
the
bed
charlotte
chatterton
cried
alexia
thoroughly
annoyed
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
do
listen
to
her
girls
but
come
on
and
she
ran
out
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
other
girls
all
stopped
short
i
do
think
polly
would
like
it
and
it
is
right
said
charlotte
hating
to
preach
but
standing
her
ground
at
this
alexia
out
in
the
hall
came
running
back
oh
dear
dear
it
perfectly
dreadful
to
be
with
such
good
people
there
now
charlotte
do
look
like
that
rushing
up
to
the
tall
girl
and
standing
on
tiptoe
to
drop
a
kiss
on
the
sallow
cheek
we
wo
go
we
stay
at
home
and
be
martyrs
and
she
began
to
tear
off
her
hat
with
a
tragic
air
why
not
go
to
madam
dyce
and
ask
her
to
loan
us
some
of
her
old
brocades
and
bonnets
proposed
cathie
harrison
suddenly
she
got
a
perfect
lot
of
horrible
antiques
the
very
thing
cried
alexia
the
others
coming
in
as
chorus
charlotte
chatterton
rushed
as
happily
as
any
of
them
for
her
walking
things
and
then
doctor
fisher
office
hours
may
be
over
and
we
may
stop
there
on
our
way
home
she
cried
doctor
fisher
office
hours
were
not
only
over
but
the
little
doctor
assured
one
and
all
of
the
eager
group
that
precipitated
themselves
upon
him
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
delight
than
to
be
a
lord
of
misrule
at
the
celebration
to
be
gotten
up
for
the
and
it
a
very
appropriate
way
to
celebrate
my
dears
he
said
beaming
at
them
over
his
large
spectacles
for
it
will
be
for
the
coming
of
the
king
king
by
name
as
well
as
nature
and
he
laughed
enjoyably
at
his
own
pun
and
i
sure
nobody
ever
did
rule
his
kingdom
so
well
as
our
grandpapa
so
let
have
a
splendid
mummery
or
masquing
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
in
my
opinion
you
were
very
smart
to
think
it
up
thereupon
alexia
pulled
charlotte
chatterton
unwillingly
into
the
center
of
the
group
that
surrounded
the
little
doctor
we
did
it
was
all
charlotte
she
said
doctor
fisher
took
a
long
look
at
the
pink
spot
on
charlotte
sallow
cheek
and
into
her
happy
eyes
then
he
turned
and
surveyed
the
bevy
we
have
a
good
time
my
dears
he
said
now
polly
exclaimed
old
king
drawing
her
back
an
instant
before
stepping
into
farmer
higby
big
carryall
waiting
at
the
station
as
the
train
came
in
you
must
even
look
as
if
you
had
any
secret
on
your
mind
oh
come
now
that
wo
do
my
dear
turning
her
around
to
study
the
dancing
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
i
ca
take
you
home
looking
like
that
i
really
ca
my
dear
polly
tried
to
pull
down
her
face
but
with
such
poor
success
that
the
old
gentleman
sighed
in
dismay
well
you
must
be
careful
to
keep
away
from
everybody
as
much
as
you
can
he
whispered
as
he
helped
her
into
the
ancient
vehicle
and
whatever
you
do
do
say
much
to
jasper
or
you
surely
let
the
whole
thing
out
and
he
got
in
beside
her
there
drive
on
do
mr
higby
you
tell
jasper
that
he
is
to
go
back
to
mr
marlowe
polly
leaned
over
and
was
guilty
of
whispering
behind
farmer
higby
broad
back
oh
grandpapa
you
wo
keep
him
waiting
to
know
that
will
you
she
begged
anxiously
no
that
shall
be
at
once
as
soon
as
i
see
my
boy
replied
the
old
gentleman
but
the
rest
polly
how
marlowe
is
coming
to
look
in
upon
us
at
our
own
home
and
to
meet
us
the
very
evening
we
arrive
that
to
be
kept
as
dark
as
possible
yes
indeed
cried
polly
getting
back
into
her
own
corner
with
a
happy
little
wriggle
all
unconscious
of
grandpapa
conspiracy
with
mother
fisher
in
regard
to
the
for
if
i
ca
have
the
surprise
party
i
started
for
declared
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
i
have
a
jollification
at
the
other
end
so
he
had
telegraphed
to
fisher
an
additional
message
to
his
many
letters
all
on
the
same
subject
have
what
celebration
you
like
and
invite
whom
you
like
and
let
it
be
gay
for
the
college
boys
have
got
leave
and
they
bring
a
friend
and
at
such
intervals
when
he
could
take
his
mind
from
jasper
and
his
affairs
it
afforded
king
infinite
delight
to
tap
a
certain
letter
in
his
breast
pocket
that
opened
might
have
revealed
in
bold
characters
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
for
his
kindness
in
inviting
the
writer
on
with
joel
which
was
gladly
accepted
and
signed
robert
bingley
where
jasper
said
king
as
he
and
polly
got
out
of
the
carryall
into
the
bustle
of
the
farmhouse
delight
over
their
return

any
of
us

jack
loughead

happy
face
and
he
barely
touched
the
extended
palm
while
he
mumbled
something
about
being
glad
to
be
there
then
awkwardly
stood
still
cabot
who
evidently
did
not
regard

friendliest
of

after
him
to
call
he
turned
and
tried
to
smile
then
walked
off
leaving
polly
standing
in
the
lane
jasper
said
cabot
in
great
irritation
when
jasper
and
phronsie
wandered
into
farmer
higby
neat
kitchen
a
later
with
torn
garments
and
muddy
shoes
they
got
home
while
you
were
away
and
that
tiresome
loughead
came
a
little
before
them
and
he
made
polly
go
to
walk
with
him
actually
made
her
cabot
leaned
her
jeweled
hands
on
higby
spotless
pine
table
and
regarded
him
in
great
distress
jasper
bent
his
broad
straw
hat
over
the
basket
of

a
minute
oh

phronsie
clapping

darting

jasper
bringing
his
gaze
off
from

fish

think

higby
and
he
went
out
of
the
kitchen
without
looking
at
cabot
up
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
ran
against
jack
loughead
it
all
against
me
king
said
jack
unsteadily
jasper
lifted
heavy
eyes
that
all
at
once
held
a
lightning
gleam
then
he
put
his
good
right
hand
on
jack
shoulder
i

about
to

head

she
exclaimed
and
allowing
her
hands

phronsie
in
a
penitent
little
voice
and
enjoying
to
the
fullest
extent
the
petting
she
was
receiving

so

the
farmer

of
comfort

phronsie
reflectively
peering
around
at
the
spotless
kitchen
floor
with
muddy
boots
on
and
spoiled
it
and
talked
when
you
wanted
to
weigh
out
things
and
make
cake
and
once
do
you
remember
higby
i
left
the
pantry
door
open
and
the
cat
got
in
and
ate
up
part
of
the
custard
pudding
bless
your
heart
exclaimed
higby
with
another
squeeze
forgot
all
about
it
but
i
have
said
phronsie
with
a
sigh
and
i
sorry
well
now
said
the
farmer
wife
i
tell
you
how
we
will
settle
that
if
you
come
again
to
the
farm
and
give
my
old
eyes
a
sight
of
you
that
make
it
all
right
you
not
old
cried
phronsie
wriggling
enough
out
of
arms
to
look
at
the
round
red
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
oh
higby
and
you
just
as
nice
with
that
she
clasped
her
impulsively
around
the
neck
and
pickering
likes
you
too
higby
continued
phronsie
he
says
you
as
good
as
gold
you
do
say
so
cried
farmer
higby
intensely
gratified
well
he
as
nice
a
boy
as
ever
lived
i
sure
and
i
just
as
tickled
as
i
can
be
that
that
fever
was
broke
up
so
sudden
for
you
see
phronsie
he
got
the
making
of
being
a
right
smart
man
yet
grandpapa
is
going
to
have
pickering
go
home
with
us
said
phronsie
confidentially
and
edging
away
from
the
farmer
wife
to
facilitate
conversation
and
he
going
to
stay
at
our
house
with
us
till
he
gets
nice
and
strong
well
i
dreadful
glad
of
that
declared
higby
heartily
for
that
of
his
well
there
phronsie
she
ai
to
my
taste
she
is
such
a
making
sort
of
woman
she
comes
in
here
and
she
wants
to
make
me
do
this
and
do
that
till
i
most
out
of
my
wits
and
i
like
to
take
my
broom
and
say
as
i
do
to
the
cat
and
a
black
frown
settled
on
higby
pleasant
face
phronsie
began
to
look
quite
grave
she
loves
pickering
she
said
thoughtfully
and
when
he
was
so
bad
she
cried
almost
all
the
time
mrs
higby
oh
she
loves
him
well
enough
answered
higby
but
she
fusses
over
him
so
and
wants
her
way
all
the
same
it
would
be
good
if
she
thought
somebody
else
knew
something
once
in
a
while
and
she
began
to
splash
in
the
vigorously
to
make
up
for
lost
time
quickly
heaping
up
a
pile
of
dishes
to
drain
on
the
little
old
tray
let
me
wipe
them
do
higby
begged
phronsie
eagerly
and
without
waiting
for
the
permission
she
felt
quite
sure
of
phronsie
picked
up
the
long
brown
towel
and
set
to
work
upstairs
jasper
and
his
father
were
going
over
again
all
the
incidents
of
king
and
polly
trip
that
the
old
gentleman
was
willing
to
communicate
and
jasper
despite
his
eagerness
to
know
all
the
whys
and
wherefores
held
himself
in
check
as
well
as
he
could
scarcely
realizing
that
he
was
really
to
go
back
to
marlowe
and
polly
and
cabot
were
busily
packing
with
the
aid
of
a
daughter
who
lived
near
while
polly
who
dearly
loved
to
do
it
all
herself
was
forced
to
stand
by
and
direct
matters
and
old
loughead
divided
his
time
between
stalking
out
to
the
piazza
where
pickering
was
slowly
pacing
back
and
forth
in
his
constitutional
to
insist
that
he
should
walks
his
legs
off
and
calling
polly
from
her
work
just
to
help
me
a
bit
my
dear
when
he
got
into
a
tight
place
over
the
packing
that
he
insisted
should
be
done
by
none
but
his
own
two
hands
and
the
whole
farmhouse
was
soon
thrown
into
such
a
bustle
and
ferment
that
any
one
looking
in
would
have
known
without
the
telling
that
king
family
are
going
home
and
after
a
day
or
so
of
all
this
farmer
higby
carried
a
of
trunks
down
to
the
little
station
and
his
wife
drove
the
carryall
in
the
back
of
which
pickering
was
carefully
tucked
with
cabot
who
insisted
on
being
beside
him
and
old
loughead
in
front
the
others
of
the
party
merrily
following
in
a
large
old
vehicle
of
no
particular
pattern
whatever
and
before
anybody
could
hardly
realize
it
the
train
came
rushing
in
and
there
were
hurried
and
and
they
were
off
phronsie
crying
as
she
held
to
her
i
wish
you
were
going
too
i
do
dear
mrs
higby
and
the
farmer
and
his
wife
were
left
on
the
platform
staring
after
them
with
sorry
eyes
well
now
phronsie
said
king
as
they
quieted
down
and
phronsie
turned
back
after
the
last
look
at
the
little
station
i
think
it
is
time
to
answer
your
question
so
as
to
let
you
go
home
without
anything
on
your
mind
about
charlotte
you
mean
grandpapa
whispered
phronsie
softly
with
wide
eyes
and
glancing
back
to
see
that
no
one
else
heard
to
be
sure
about
charlotte
said
the
old
gentleman
well
concluded
you
ought
to
have
your
way
and
make
charlotte
a
gift
of
some
money
if
you
want
to
oh
grandpapa
cried
phronsie
in
a
suppressed
scream
and
having
great
difficulty
not
to
clap
her
hands
oh
how
good
then
she
sat
quite
still
and
folded
them
in
silent
rapture
and
i
see
that
it
is
fixed
as
soon
as
may
be
after
we
get
home
said
the
old
gentleman
and
i
sure
i
glad
you
done
it
phronsie
for
i
think
charlotte
is
a
very
good
sort
of
a
girl
charlotte
is
just
lovely
cried
phronsie
with
warmth
and
i
think
grandpapa
that
dear
chatterton
up
in
heaven
is
glad
too
that
i
done
it
old
king
turned
away
with
a
mild
snort
and
then
not
finding
any
words
to
say
picked
up
the
newspaper
and
phronsie
full
of
her
new
happiness
looked
out
the
window
as
the
cars
sped
along
there
thomas
cried
jasper
at
sight
of
that
functionary
waiting
on
his
as
he
had
waited
so
many
other
times
for
them
now
for
the
jolliest
of
all
and
the
girls
finished
polly
craning
her
neck
to
look
out
the
car
window
at
a
knot
of
them
restlessly
curbing
their
impatience
on
the
platform
as
the
train
moved
into
the
station
and
why
mamsie
oh
jasper
how
slow
we
are
pickering
dodge
shook
his
long
legs
impatiently
as
he
got
out
of
his
seat
do
try
to
help
me
loughead
he
said
testily
as
the
old
gentleman
offered
his
arm
i
not
sick
now
no
thanks
i
go
out
alone
jasper
now
ran
up
but
he
did
offer
to
help
but
waited
patiently
for
pickering
slow
movements
as
he
worked
his
way
unsteadily
down
the
aisle
do
stop
by
me
said
pickering
rather
crossly
go
ahead
jasper
and
get
the
fun
nonsense
exclaimed
jasper
yet
feeling
his
heart
bound
at
the
merry
din
as
polly
was
surrounded
and
the
babel
of
voices
waxed
louder
for
everybody
was
now
out
of
the
car
but
pickering
and
himself
here
we
are
now
as
they
neared
the
car
step
alexia
rhys
back
on
the
platform
hanging
to
polly
who
had
one
hand
in
mother
fisher
at
the
expense
of
all
the
other
girls
who
could
get
the
chance
looked
up
and
saw
pickering
dodge
and
dropping
polly
arm
she
ran
lightly
across
the
stream
of
passengers
and
put
out
her
hand
how
do
you
do
pickering
it
so
good
to
see
you
back
pickering
shot
her
an
astonished
glance
then
he
said
gratefully
thank
you
alexia
and
he
actually
let
her
help
him
down
the
steps
which
so
astonished
her
that
it
took
away
her
breath
and
left
her
without
a
word
to
say
and
the
rest
was
all
bustle
and
confusion
king
declaring
it
was
worse
than
a
everybody
talking
together
and
jasper
ran
off
to
see
to
the
luggage
for
the
whole
party
followed
by
ben
trying
to
help
and
old
loughead
had
to
be
introduced
all
around
and
little
doctor
fisher
tried
to
get
them
all
settled
in
the
carriages
but
at
last
gave
it
up
in
despair

looked
back
to

after
them

evening
cried
the
girls
back
again
and
phronsie
hopping
in
after
her
the
was
shut
and
off
they
rolled
and
old
turner
was
waiting
at
the
steps
as
the
carriage
rolled
up
the
winding
drive
with
a
monstrous
bouquet
of
his
choicest
blossoms
for
polly
and
one
exactly
like
it
only
a
little
smaller
for
phronsie
and
prince
came
rushing
out
getting
in
every
one
way
and
nearly
devouring
phronsie
and
there
was
king
fisher
running
away
on
toddling
feet
from
his
nurse
to
meet
them
screaming
with
all
his
might
and
fargo
with
johnny
in
her
arms
crowing
with
delight
all
stood
on
the
broad
stone
porch
oh
oh
cried
polly
jumping
out
her
cheeks
aflame
are
we
really
at
home
oh
oh
echoed
phronsie
flying
at
them
all
and
trying
to
keep
hold
of
prince
at
the
same
time
and
there
in
the
wide
hall
drawn
back
within
the
shadow
of
the
oaken
door
were
and
whitney
and
dick
ready
to
pounce
upon
them
in
a
moment
and
no
one
ever
hinted
a
suspicion
that
the
college
boys
were
steaming
along
as
fast
as
they
could
for
the
evening
festivities
and
old
king
appeared
superbly
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
marlowe
was
waiting
at
a
hotel
for
that
hour
to
arrive
and
everybody
rushed
off
to
get
ready
for
dinner
with
the
exception
of
polly
and
jasper
and
phronsie
oh
we
must
go
in
the
conservatory
just
for
a
minute
begged
phronsie
flying
off
on
eager
feet
we
only
take
one
peep
said
polly
just
as
eagerly
come
on
jasper
and
then
polly
had
to
run
into
the
long
and
just
look
at
her
piano
and
lay
her
fingers
lovingly
on
the
keys
do
try
it
with
your
lame
hand
polly
begged
jasper
close
beside
no
i
wo
promised
polly
running
light
scales
with
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
but
oh
jasper
i
do
verily

i
could
my
arm

wo

polly
with
a
little
laugh
but
it

to
the
piano
as
she
unwillingly
got
up
from
the
and
let
jasper
lead
her
off
before
you
and
i
have
all
our
good
times
together
polly
in
a
soft
white

on
a

seat
by

side
her
head
in
mamsie
lap
it
was
after

and
the
gas

strong
fingers
closer

somebody
looked
into
mother
fisher
bedroom

jasper
as

them
but
there

so
much
longing
in
the
voice
that
polly
called
out
oh

mamsie

sit

by
you
here
and
he
went
over
to
her
where
she
sat
on
the
sofa
it
was
the
same
big
comfortable
affair
where
joel
had
flung
himself
when
he
declared
he
could
not
keep
on
at
school
and
where
mamsie
had
often
sat
when
the
children
brought
her
their
troubles
declaring
it
was
easier
to
tell
her
everything
on
the
roomy
sofa
than
anywhere
else

cried
fisher
cordially
and
making
way
for
him
to
sit
down
by
her
side
now

mother

his
wife

jasper
face
laid
her
other
hand
upon
his
i
love
him
enough
she
said
for
that
oh
jasper
old
king
walked
proudly
down
the
long
with
polly
on
his
arm
everybody
was
in
the
highest
possible
spirits
the
lord
of
misrule
had
made
a
triumphant
entree
covering
himself
with
glory
and
winning
great
applause
for
his
long
train
of
masquers
whose
costumes
if
not
gotten
up
on
strict
historical
lines
made
up
any
lack
by
the
variety
of
other
contrivances
each
one
following
his
own
sweet
will
in
dressing
they
had
gone
through
with
the
minuet
and
the
pantomimes
and
charlotte
in
a
peaked
hat
and
a
big
flowered
brocade
gown
rich
with
tambour
lace
had
sung
like
a
nightingale
as
more
than
one
declared
and
now
the
room
was
in
a
buzz
of
applause
old
king
took
this
time
to
walk
up
and
down
the
long
room
with
polly
several
times
quite
pompously
and
once
in
a
while
the
little
lord
of
misrule
would
rush
up
to
them
say
something
very
earnest
seize
hand
and
give
it
a
shake
and
then
dart
away
which
proceeding
joel
would
imitate
at
such
times
leaving
robert
bingley
to
his
own
devices
until
joel
evidently
struck
by
remorse
would
as
suddenly
fly
back
and
introduce
his
college
friend
violently
to
right
and
left
to
make
up
for
lost
time
that
three
times
you
introduced
me
to
that
girl
in
blue
said
bingley
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
he
could
get
joel
aside
for
a
minute
do
let
me
alone
i
was
having
a
good
enough
time
where
i
was
did
i
cried
joel
opening
his
black
eyes
at
him
oh
beg
pardon
and
off
he
rushed
at
polly
again
how
queerly
they
do
act
cried
alexia
to
a
knot
of
the
girls
and
just
look
at
king
he
holds
on
to
polly
every
minute
i
going
to
see
what
it
all
about
so
she
hurried
across
the
room
as
fast
as
her
slippers
would
let
her
polly
polly
did
you
really
like
it
all
she
asked
breathlessly
oh
dear
me
this
ruff
will
be
the
death
of
me
picking
at
it
with
impatient
fingers
do
alexia
cried
polly
it
so
pretty
it
was
all
just
as
fine
as
could
be
and
splendidly
gotten
up
well
it
nearly
killed
us
declared
alexia
fanning
herself
violently
and
this
old
ruff
will
end
me
there
and
she
made
a
little
break
in
the
starched
affair
under
her
chin
that
one
degree
less
of
misery
what
would
queen
bess
do
to
you
cried
polly
saying
the
first
thing
that
came
in
her
head
to
keep
off
questions
she
saw
trembling
on
alexia
tongue
queen
bess
was
an
old
goose
to
wear
such
a
thing
retorted
alexia
oh
polly
do
come
with
us
let
her
do
king
to
the
old
gentleman
who
made
all
sorts
of
signs
that
served
to
show
he
meant
to
keep
polly
to
himself
we
girls
want
her
now
she
added
saucily
you
keep
away
said
old
king
with
an
emphatic
nod
and
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
the
other
girls
i
going
to
have
polly
tonight
you
can
come
over
in
the
morning
and
see
her
and
he
moved
off
coolly
carrying
polly
with
him
illustration
polly
do
come
with
us
alexia
stood
a
moment
transfixed
with
astonishment
joel
joel
what
is
it
she
cried
in
a
stage
whisper
as
that
individual
pranced
by
in
one
of
his
fits
of
remorse
looking
up
bingley
do
tell
me
what
come
over
polly
and
why
does
king
act
so
queerly
joel
flashed
her
a
smile
but
would
say
anything
and
his
eyes
twinkled
so
exactly
like
king
that
alexia
lost
all
patience
oh
you
horrid
boy
she
cried
and
ran
back
dismally
to
the
girls
with
nothing
to
tell
and
charlotte
chatterton
walked
as
if
she
disdained
the
ground
her
peaked
hat
towering
threateningly
while
her
sallow
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
sing
enough
throwing
in
encores
in
a
perfectly
reckless
fashion
what
is
it
oh
i
shall
die
if
i
do
know
exclaimed
alexia
over
and
over
girls
if
some
of
you
do
find
out
what
going
on
i
shall
fly
crazy
and
the
room
buzzed
and
buzzed
with
delight
the
growing
mystery
not
lessening
the
hilarity
that
an
uncommonly
fine
fellow
i
just
been
talking
with
said
mason
whitney
coming
up
to
old
king
still
keeping
polly
by
his
side
i
have
met
such
a
man
in
one
spell
he
a
intellectual
chap
and
he
been
around
the
world
a
good
deal
it
easy
to
see
by
his
fine
manner
where
did
you
pick
him
up
whom
are
you
talking
of
mason
asked
king
in
his
crispest
fashion
why
that
new
man
i
did
catch
the
name
when
i
was
introduced
that
you
invited
here
said
whitney
with
a
little
touch
of
the
asperity
yet
remaining
over
the
failure
of
his
plan
for
jasper
and
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
marlowe
he
oh
that
jasper
publisher
marlowe
said
the
old
gentleman
trying
to
speak
carelessly
then
he
burst
into
a
laugh
at
whitney
face
whew
exclaimed
that
gentleman
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
i
got
to
eat
humble
pie
before
my
son
dick
and
you
taken
my
breath
away
polly
looking
at
her
blooming
cheeks
and
happy
eyes
with
that
piece
of
news
and
what
news
oh
what
news
cried
alexia
coming
up
too
frantic
to
remember
her
manners
please
tell
us
girls
for
we
are
dying
to
know
you
come
away
retorted
whitney
unceremoniously
and
king
laughed
and
polly
shook
her
white
fan
at
them
as
the
two
moved
off
and
it
was
just
as
bad
as
ever
pickering
do
you
know
at
last
demanded
alexia
as
he
leaned
against
the
doorway
surveying
the
bright
crowd
yes
i
know
enough
that
is
i
can
guess
do
ask
me
oh
what
breathlessly
cried
alexia
seizing
his
arm
do
tell
me
pickering
that
is
a
dear
oh
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
the
girls
i
do
know
what
i
doing
anyway
polly
has
so
upset
me
well
she
has
upset
me
too
alexia
said
pickering
gloomily
but
it
is
her
fault
she
could
help
it
alexia
feeling
that
here
was
coming
something
quite
worth
her
while
to
hear
waited
patiently
you
all
know
i
loved
polly
for
years
said
pickering
steadily
i
made
no
secret
of
it
i
know
it
said
alexia
full
of
sympathy
and
not
daring
to
breathe
lest
she
should
spoil
it
all
well
go
on
and
when
i
was
sick
i
hoped
that
things
might
be
different
for
polly
was
sorry
for
me
but
one
day
aunt
was
talking
about
it
to
me
in
a
way
that
made
me
mad
and
i
knew
that
polly
would
be
bothered
awfully
if
she
ever
got
at
her
so
i
told
polly
the
first
chance
i
got
that
she
was
never
to
be
sorry
for
me
any
more
for
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
think
of
her
in
that
way
again
which
was
an
awful
lie
declared
pickering
suddenly
standing
quite
erect
for
i
ca
help
it
oh
dear
dear
exclaimed
alexia
quite
gone
in
sympathy
things
just
shameful
in
the
world
of
course
you
ought
to
be
allowed
to
marry
polly
for
you
are
not
half
good
enough
for
her
pickering
she
added
frankly
but
i
so
sorry
for
you
and
she
put
out
her
hand
instinctively
pickering
took
it
and
held
it
a
minute
in
a
calm
grasp
with
the
air
of
a
man
considering
it
better
to
take
the
little
since
he
could
get
all
he
wanted
illustration
and
you
will
be
my
own
brother
jasper
said
phronsie
but
now
tell
why
polly
and
king
and
all
the
family
act
so
funnily
cried
alexia
pulling
away
her
hand
and
suddenly
awaking
to
the
fact
that
this
important
piece
of
news
had
not
been
made
known
to
her
ca
you
see
for
yourself
cried
pickering
with
an
impatient
stare
why
alexia
where
are
your
eyes
which
was
all
she
could
get
him
to
say
as
pickering
walked
off
immediately
jasper
all
this
while
seemed
to
find
it
impossible
to
be
separated
from
mother
fisher
and
together
they
wandered
up
and
down
the
phronsie
clinging
to
his
hand
i
always
longed
since
the
little
brown
house
days
to
call
you
mamsie
he
said
affectionately
looking
down
into
fisher
face
and
now
i
can
and
you
will
really
and
truly
be
my
very
own
brother
jasper
said
phronsie
as
they
walked
on
