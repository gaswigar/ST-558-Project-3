so
you

a
mr
elliot
the
situation
was
piquant
even
though
it
was
at
her
expense
for
him
the
beauty
of
the
night
lay
largely
in
her
presence
the
yukon
trail
chapter
i
going
in
the
midnight
sun
had
set
but
in
a
crotch
between
two
it
had
kindled
a
vast
caldron
from
which
rose
a
mist
of
jewels
garnet
and
turquoise
topaz
and
amethyst
and
opal
all
swimming
in
a
sea
of
molten
gold
the
glow
of
it
still
clung
to
the
face
of
the
broad
yukon
as
a
flush
does
to
the
soft
wrinkled
cheek
of
a
girl
just
roused
from
deep
sleep
except
for
a
faint
murkiness
in
the
air
it
was
still
day
there
was
light
enough
for
the
four
men
playing
pinochle
on
the
upper
deck
though
the
women
of
their
party
gossiping
in
chairs
grouped
near
at
hand
had
at
last
put
aside
their
embroidery
the
girl
who
sat
by
herself
at
a
little
distance
held
a
magazine
still
open
on
her
lap
if
she
were
not
reading
her
attitude
suggested
it
was
less
because
of
the
dusk
than
that
she
had
surrendered
herself
to
the
spell
of
the
mysterious
beauty
which
for
this
hour
at
least
had
transfigured
the
north
to
a
land
all
light
and
atmosphere
and
color
gordon
elliot
had
taken
the
boat
at
pierre
portage
fifty
miles
farther
down
the
river
he
had
come
direct
from
the
creeks
and
his
impressions
of
the
motley
pioneer
life
at
the
were
so
vivid
that
he
had
found
an
isolated
corner
of
the
deck
where
he
could
scribble
them
in
a
notebook
while
still
fresh
but
he
had
not
been
too
busy
to
see
that
the
girl
in
the
wicker
chair
was
as
much
of
an
outsider
as
he
was
plainly
this
was
her
first
trip
in
gordon
was
a
stranger
in
the
yukon
country
one
not
likely
to
be
when
it
became
known
what
his
mission
was
it
may
have
been
because
he
was
out
of
the
picture
himself
that
he
resented
a
little
the
exclusion
of
the
young
woman
with
the
magazine
certainly
she
herself
gave
no
evidence
of
feeling
about
it
her
eyes
looked
dreamily
across
the
river
to
the
glowing
hills
beyond
not
once
did
they
turn
with
any
show
of
interest
to
the
lively
party
under
the
awning
from
where
he
was
leaning
against
the
deckhouse
elliot
could
see
only
a
fine
chiseled
profile
shading
into
a
mass
of
crisp
black
hair
but
some
quality
in
the
detachment
of
her
personality
stimulated
gently
his
imagination
he
wondered
who
she
could
be
his
work
had
taken
him
to
frontier
camps
before
but
he
could
not
place
her
as
a
type
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
guess
that
she
might
be
the
daughter
of
some
territorial
official
on
her
way
in
to
join
him
a
short
man
who
had
ridden
down
on
the
stage
with
elliot
to
pierre
portage
drifted
along
the
deck
toward
him
he
wore
the
careless
garb
of
a
mining
man
in
a
country
which
looks
first
to
comfort
bound
for
kusiak
he
asked
by
way
of
opening
conversation
yes
answered
gordon
the
miner
nodded
toward
the
group
under
the
awning
that
bunch
lives
at
kusiak
they
got
on
at
different
places
the
last
two
or
three
days
except
selfridge
and
his
wife
they
been
out
guess
you
can
tell
that
from
hearing
her
talk
the
little
woman
in
red
with
the
snappy
black
eyes
she
spillin
over
with
talk
about
the
styles
in
new
york
and
the
cabarets
and
the
new
shows
that
little
fellow
in
the
checked
suit
is
selfridge
he
is
colby
macdonald
man
friday
elliot
took
in
with
a
quickened
interest
the
group
bound
for
kusiak
he
had
noticed
that
they
monopolized
as
a
matter
of
course
the
best
places
on
the
deck
and
in
the
they
were
civil
enough
to
outsiders
but
their
manner
had
the
unconscious
selfishness
that
often
regulates
social
activities
it
excluded
from
their
gayety
everybody
that
did
not
belong
to
the
proper
set
that
sort
of
thing
gets
my
goat
the
miner
went
on
sourly
those
women
over
there
have
elected
themselves
society
with
a
capital
they
put
on
all
the
airs
the
four
hundred
do
in
new
york
and
who
the
hell
are
they
anyhow
wives
to
a
bunch
of
grafting
politicians
mostly
from
the
casual
talk
that
had
floated
to
him
with
its
many
little
allusions
punctuating
the
jolly
of
their
repartee
elliot
guessed
that
their
lives
had
the
same
background
of
tennis
dinners
hops
official
gossip
and
business
they
evidently
knew
one
another
with
the
intimacy
that
comes
only
to
the
segment
of
a
small
community
shut
off
largely
from
the
world
and
forced
into
close
social
relations
no
doubt
they
had
loaned
each
other
money
occasionally
stood
by
in
trouble
and
gossiped
back
and
forth
about
their
shortcomings
and
family
skeletons
even
as
society
on
the
outside
does
that
the
way
of
the
world
is
it
our
civilization
is
built
on
the
group
system
suggested
elliot
maybeso
grumbled
the
miner
but
i
hate
to
see
alaska
come
to
it
me
i
saw
this
country
first
in
packed
an
outfit
in
over
the
pass
every
man
stood
on
his
own
hind
legs
then
he
got
there
if
he
was
strong
mebbe
he
bogged
down
on
the
trail
good
and
plenty
if
he
was
weak
we
did
have
any
of
the
artificial
stuff
then
a
man
had
to
have
the
guts
to
stand
the
gaff
i
suppose
it
was
a
wild
country
mr
strong
the
little
miner
eyes
gleamed
best
country
in
the
world
we
did
stand
for
anything
that
was
on
the
level
it
was
a
poor
man
country
wages
fifteen
dollars
a
day
and
plenty
of
work
everybody
had
a
chance
anybody
could
stake
a
claim
and
gamble
on
his
luck
now
the
big
corporations
have
slipped
in
and
grabbed
the
best
it
a
prospector
proposition
any
more
instead
of
faro
banks
we
got
savings
banks
the
dance
hall
has
quit
business
in
favor
of
moving
pictures
and
as
i
said
before
we
got
society
all
frontier
countries
have
to
come
to
it
hmp
in
the
days
i
telling
you
about
that
crowd
there
could
hustled
meat
to
fill
their
bellies
three
meals
parasites
that
what
they
are
they
living
off
that
bunch
of
roughnecks
down
there
and
folks
like
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
strong
pointed
to
a
group
of
miners
who
had
boarded
the
boat
with
them
at
pierre
portage
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
the
men
for
the
most
part
husky
foreigners
they
had
been
drinking
and
were
in
a
sullen
humor
elliot
gathered
from
their
talk
that
they
had
lost
their
jobs
because
they
had
tried
to
organize
an
incipient
strike
in
the
frozen
gulch
district
roughnecks
and
that
all
they
are
but
they
earn
their
way
not
that
i
blame
macdonald
for
firing
them
mind
you
continued
the
miner
were
they
working
for
macdonald
yep
his
superintendent
up
there
was
too
soft
these
here
swedes
got
gay
mac
hit
the
trail
for
frozen
gulch
he
hammered
his
big
fist
into
the
of
the
ringleader
and
said
that
running
yet
i
bet
then
mac
called
the
men
together
and
read
the
riot
act
to
them
he
fired
this
bunch
on
the
boat
and
was
out
of
the
camp
before
you
could
bat
an
eye
it
was
the
cleanest
job
i
ever
did
see
from
what
i
heard
about
him
he
must
be
a
remarkable
man
he
the
biggest
man
in
alaska
bar
none
this
was
a
subject
that
interested
gordon
elliot
very
much
colby
macdonald
and
his
activities
had
brought
him
to
the
country
do
you
mean
personally
or
because
he
represents
the
big
corporations
both
his
word
comes
pretty
near
being
law
up
here
not
only
because
he
stands
for
the
consolidated
but
because
he
one
man
from
the
ground
up
i
ai
any
too
strong
for
that
new
york
bunch
of
capitalists
back
of
mac
but
i
got
to
give
it
to
him
that
he
all
there
without
leaning
on
anybody
i
heard
that
he
a
domineering
man
rides
roughshod
over
others
is
that
right
mr
strong
he
a
bear
for
getting
his
own
way
grinned
the
little
miner
if
you
wo
get
out
of
his
road
he
peels
your
hide
off
and
hangs
it
up
to
dry
but
i
ca
help
liking
him
he
big
every
way
you
take
him
stand
the
acid
mac
will
do
you
mean
that
he
square
honest
you
said
two
things
my
friend
answered
strong
dryly
square
if
he
tells
you
anything
do
worry
because
he
ai
put
down
his
john
hancock
before
a
notary
he
see
it
through
to
a
finish
to
a
fighting
finish
if
he
has
to
do
waste
any
time
looking
for
fat
or
yellow
streaks
in
mac
they
ai
there
nobody
ever
heard
him
squeal
yet
and
what
more
nobody
ever
will
no
wonder
men
like
him
but
when
you
say
honest
hell
no
not
the
way
you
define
honesty
down
in
the
states
he
a
grabber
mac
is
better
not
leave
anything
valuable
around
unless
you
got
it
spiked
to
the
floor
he
takes
what
he
wants
what
does
he
look
like
asked
gordon
oh
i
do
know
strong
hesitated
while
he
searched
for
words
to
show
the
picture
in
his
mind
big
as
a
house
steps
out
like
a
buck
in
the
spring
eyes
that
bore
right
through
you
how
old
search
me
you
never
think
of
age
when
you
looking
at
him
mebbe
or
fifty
i
do
know
married
hanford
strong
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
kusiak
circle
they
say
he
going
to
marry
mallory
she
the
one
with
the
red
hair
it
struck
young
elliot
that
the
miner
was
dismissing
mallory
in
too
cavalier
a
fashion
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
at
whom
men
look
twice
and
then
continue
to
look
while
she
appears
magnificently
unaware
of
it
her
hair
was
not
red
but
of
a
lustrous
bronze
amazingly
abundant
and
dressed
in
waves
with
the
careful
skill
of
a
coiffeur
smouldering
eyes
had
met
his
for
an
instant
at
dinner
across
the
table
and
had
told
him
she
was
a
woman
subtle
and
complex
slightest
shades
of
meaning
she
could
convey
with
a
lift
of
the
eyebrow
or
an
intonation
of
the
musical
voice
if
she
was
already
fencing
with
the
encroaching
years
there
was
little
evidence
of
it
in
her
opulent
good
looks
she
had
manifestly
specialized
in
graceful
idleness
and
was
prepared
to
meet
with
superb
confidence
the
competition
of
débutantes
the
elusive
shadow
of
lost
illusions
of
knowledge
born
of
experience
was
the
only
betrayal
of
vanished
youth
in
her
equipment
chapter
ii
enter
a
man
the
whistle
of
the
hannah
blew
for
the
tatlah
cache
landing
while
strong
and
elliot
were
talking
wally
selfridge
had
just
bid
three
hundred
seventy
and
found
no
help
in
the
widow
he
pushed
toward
each
of
the
other
players
one
red
chip
and
two
white
ones
ca
make
it
he
announced
i
needed
a
jack
of
clubs
the
men
counted
their
chips
and
settled
up
in
time
to
reach
the
deck
rail
just
as
the
gangplank
was
thrown
out
to
the
wharf
the
crew
transferred
to
the
landing
a
pouch
of
mail
half
a
ton
of
sacked
potatoes
some
mining
machinery
and
several
boxes
containing
provisions
and
dry
goods
a
man
came
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
carrying
a
suitcase
he
was
thick
in
the
chest
and
he
came
up
the
gangplank
with
the
strong
firm
tread
of
a
man
in
his
prime
looking
down
from
above
gordon
elliot
guessed
him
to
be
in
the
early
thirties
mallory
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
which
she
did
with
a
drawling
little
shout
of
welcome
oh
you
man
i
knew
you
first
i
speak
for
you
she
cried
the
man
on
the
gangplank
looked
up
smiled
and
lifted
to
her
his
broad
gray
stetson
in
a
wave
of
greeting
how
do
you
do
mallory
glad
to
see
you
the
miners
from
frozen
gulch
were
grouped
together
on
the
lower
deck
at
sight
of
the
man
with
the
suitcase
a
sullen
murmur
rose
among
them
those
in
the
rear
pushed
forward
and
closed
the
lane
leading
to
the
cabins
one
of
the
miners
was
flung
roughly
against
the
new
passenger
with
a
wide
powerful
sweep
of
his
arm
the
man
who
had
just
come
aboard
hurled
the
miner
back
among
his
companions
gangway
he
said
brusquely
and
as
he
strode
forward
did
not
even
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
angry
men
pressing
toward
him
here
keep
back
there
you
fellows
none
of
that
rough
stuff
goes
ordered
the
mate
sharply
the
big
cornishman
who
had
been
tossed
aside
crouched
for
a
spring
he
launched
himself
forward
with
the
awkward
force
of
a
bear
the
suitcase
described
a
whirling
arc
of
a
circle
with
the
arm
of
its
owner
as
the
radius
the
bag
and
the
head
of
the
miner
came
into
swift
impact
like
a
bullock
which
has
been
the
man
went
to
the
floor
he
turned
over
with
a
groan
and
lay
still
the
new
passenger
looked
across
the
huge
sprawling
body
at
the
group
of
miners
facing
him
they
glared
in
savage
hate
all
they
needed
was
a
leader
to
send
them
driving
at
him
with
the
force
of
an
avalanche
the
man
at
whom
they
raged
did
not
give
an
inch
he
leaned
forward
slightly
his
weight
resting
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
alert
to
the
finger
tips
but
in
his
eyes
a
grim
little
smile
of
derisive
amusement
rested
next
he
taunted
then
the
mate
got
busy
he
hustled
his
stevedores
forward
in
front
of
the
miners
and
shook
his
fist
in
their
faces
as
he
stormed
up
and
down
if
they
wanted
trouble
by
god
it
was
waiting
for
he
swore
in
apoplectic
fury
the
hannah
was
a
river
boat
and
not
a
dive
for
wharf
rats
no
bunch
of
roughnecks
could
come
aboard
a
boat
where
he
was
mate
and
start
anything
they
could
not
assault
any
passengers
of
his
and
make
it
stick
the
man
with
the
suitcase
did
not
wait
to
hear
out
his
tirade
he
followed
the
purser
to
his
stateroom
dropped
his
baggage
beside
the
berth
and
joined
the
kusiak
group
on
the
upper
deck
they
greeted
him
eagerly
a
little
effusively
as
if
they
were
anxious
to
prove
themselves
on
good
terms
with
him
the
deference
they
paid
and
his
assured
acceptance
of
it
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
importance
but
apart
from
other
considerations
he
dominated
by
mental
and
physical
virility
the
circle
of
which
he
instantly
became
the
center
only
mallory
held
her
own
and
even
she
showed
a
quickened
interest
her
indolent
manner
sheathed
a
soft
sensuousness
that
held
the
provocation
of
sex
appeal
what
was
the
matter
asked
selfridge
how
did
the
trouble
start
the
big
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
did
start
some
of
the
outfit
thought
they
were
looking
for
a
row
but
they
balked
on
the
job
when
trelawney
got
his
turning
to
mallory
he
changed
the
subject
abruptly
did
you
have
a
good
time
down
the
river
gordon
as
he
watched
from
a
little
distance
corrected
earlier
impressions
this
man
had
passed
the
thirties
salt
and
pepper
sprinkled
the
temples
of
his
strong
lean
head
he
had
the
thick
neck
and
solid
trunk
of
middle
life
but
he
carried
himself
so
superbly
that
his
whole
bearing
denied
that
years
could
touch
his
splendid
physique
the
suit
he
wore
was
a
wrinkled
corduroy
with
trouser
legs
thrust
into
boots
an
outdoor
tan
had
been
painted
upon
his
face
and
neck
from
the
point
where
the
soft
flannel
shirt
fell
away
to
show
the
fine
slope
of
the
throat
line
to
the
shoulders
strong
had
stepped
to
the
wharf
to
talk
with
an
old
acquaintance
but
when
the
boat
threw
out
a
warning
signal
he
made
a
hurried
and
came
on
board
he
rejoined
elliot
well
what
think
of
him
was
i
right
the
young
man
had
already
guessed
who
this
imperious
stranger
was
i
never
saw
anybody
get
away
with
a
hard
job
as
easily
as
he
did
that
one
you
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
those
fellows
meant
fight
they
were
all
primed
for
it
and
he
bluffed
them
out
bluffed
them
huh
if
that
what
you
call
bluffing
i
was
where
i
could
see
just
what
happened
colby
macdonald
was
even
looking
at
trelawney
but
you
bet
he
saw
him
start
that
suitcase
traveled
like
a
streak
of
light
you
thought
it
weighed
about
two
pounds
that
ai
all
either
mac
used
his
brains
guess
what
was
in
that
grip
the
usual
thing
i
suppose
you
got
another
guess
packed
in
among
his
socks
and
underwear
was
about
twenty
pounds
of
ore
samples
the
purser
told
me
it
was
that
quartz
put
trelawney
to
sleep
so
thorough
that
he
just
begun
to
wake
up
when
i
passed
a
minute
ago
the
young
man
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
the
big
canadian
scotchman
he
was
talking
with
mallory
who
was
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
a
steamer
chair
she
had
brought
aboard
at
michael
it
would
have
been
hard
to
conceive
a
contrast
greater
than
the
one
between
this
pampered
heiress
of
the
ages
and
the
modern
business
berserk
who
looked
down
into
her
mocking
eyes
he
was
the
embodiment
of
the
dominant
male
efficient
to
the
last
inch
of
his
straight
six
feet
what
he
wanted
he
had
always
taken
by
the
sheer
strength
that
was
in
him
back
of
her
smiling
insolence
lay
a
silken
force
to
match
his
own
she
too
had
taken
what
she
wanted
from
life
but
she
had
won
it
by
indirection
manifestly
she
was
of
those
women
who
conceive
that
charm
and
beauty
are
tools
to
bend
men
to
their
wills
was
it
the
very
width
of
the
gulf
between
them
that
made
the
appeal
of
the
clash
in
the
sex
duel
upon
which
they
had
engaged
the
dusky
young
woman
with
the
magazine
was
the
first
of
those
on
the
upper
deck
to
retire
for
the
night
she
flitted
so
quietly
that
gordon
did
not
notice
until
she
had
gone
selfridge
and
her
friends
disappeared
with
their
men
folks
calling
gay
to
one
another
as
they
left
macdonald
and
mallory
still
talked
after
a
time
she
too
vanished
the
big
promoter
leaned
against
the
deck
rail
where
he
was
joined
by
selfridge
for
a
long
time
they
talked
in
low
voices
the
little
man
had
most
to
say
his
chief
listened
but
occasionally
interrupted
to
ask
a
sharp
incisive
question
elliot
sitting
farther
forward
with
strong
judged
that
selfridge
was
making
a
report
of
his
trip
once
he
caught
a
fragment
of
their
talk
enough
to
confirm
this
impression
did
winton
tell
you
that
himself
demanded
the
scotchman
the
answer
of
his
employee
came
in
a
murmur
so
low
that
the
words
were
lost
but
the
name
used
told
gordon
a
good
deal
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
at
washington
signed
his
letters
harold
winton
strong
tossed
the
stub
of
his
cigarette
overboard
and
nodded
a
glance
at
his
watch
told
elliot
that
it
was
past
two
he
rose
stretched
and
sauntered
back
to
his
stateroom
the
young
man
had
just
taken
off
his
coat
when
there
came
the
hurried
rush
of
trampling
feet
upon
the
hurricane
deck
above
almost
instantly
he
heard
a
cry
of
alarm
low
voices
quick
with
suppressed
excitement
drifted
back
to
him
he
could
hear
the
shuffling
of
footsteps
and
the
sound
of
heavy
bodies
moving
some
one
lifted
a
frightened
shout
help
help
the
call
had
come
he
thought
from
selfridge
gordon
flung
open
the
door
of
his
room
raced
along
the
deck
and
took
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
a
huddle
of
men
swayed
and
shifted
heavily
in
front
of
him
so
close
was
the
pack
that
the
motion
resembled
the
writhing
of
some
prehistoric
monster
rather
than
the
movements
of
individual
human
beings
in
that
tossing
arms
and
legs
looked
like
tentacles
flung
out
in
agony
by
the
mammoth
reptile
its
progress
was
jerky
and
convulsive
sometimes
tortuous
but
it
traveled
slowly
toward
the
rail
as
if
by
the
impulsion
of
an
irresistible
pressure
even
as
he
ran
toward
the
mass
elliot
noticed
that
the
only
sounds
were
grunts
stertorous
breathings
and
the
scraping
of
feet
the
attackers
wanted
no
publicity
the
attacked
was
too
busy
to
waste
breath
in
futile
cries
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
with
all
the
stark
energy
nature
and
his
ancestors
had
given
him
two
men
separated
from
the
crowd
lay
on
the
deck
farther
aft
one
was
on
top
of
the
other
his
fingers
clutching
the
gullet
of
his
helpless
opponent
the
agony
of
the
man
underneath
found
expression
only
in
the
drumming
heels
that
beat
a
tattoo
on
the
floor
the
spasmodic
feet
were
shod
in
oxford
tans
of
an
cut
no
doubt
the
owner
of
the
smart
footwear
had
been
pulled
down
as
he
was
escaping
to
shout
the
alarm
the
runner
hurdled
the
two
in
his
stride
and
plunged
straight
at
the
struggling
tangle
he
caught
one
man
by
the
shoulders
from
behind
and
flung
him
back
he
struck
hard
smashing
blows
as
he
fought
his
way
to
the
heart
of
the
mêlée
miners
with
corded
muscles
landed
upon
his
face
and
head
and
neck
the
strange
excitement
of
the
battle
lust
surged
through
his
veins
he
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
odds
the
sudden
attack
of
elliot
had
opened
the
pack
the
man
battling
against
a
dozen
was
colby
macdonald
the
very
number
of
his
foes
had
saved
him
so
far
from
being
rushed
overboard
or
trampled
down
in
their
desire
to
get
at
him
they
hindered
each
other
struck
blows
that
found
the
wrong
mark
his
coat
and
shirt
were
in
rags
he
was
bruised
and
battered
and
bleeding
from
the
chest
up
but
he
was
still
slogging
hard
they
had
him
pressed
to
the
rail
a
huge
miner
head
down
had
his
arms
around
the
waist
of
the
scotchman
and
was
trying
to
throw
him
overboard
macdonald
lashed
out
and
landed
flush
upon
the
cheek
of
a
man
attempting
to
brain
him
with
a
billet
of
wood
he
hammered
home
a
jolt
against
the
ear
of
the
giant
who
was
giving
him
the
bear
grip
the
big
miner
grunted
but
hung
on
like
a
football
tackler
with
a
jerk
he
raised
macdonald
from
the
floor
just
as
three
or
four
others
rushed
him
again
the
rail
gave
way
splintered
like
kindling
wood
the
scotchman
and
the
man
at
grips
with
him
went
over
the
side
together
clear
and
loud
rang
the
voice
of
elliot
man
overboard
the
wheelsman
had
known
for
some
minutes
that
there
was
trouble
afoot
he
signaled
to
the
engine
room
to
reverse
and
blew
short
sharp
shrieks
of
warning
already
deckhands
and
officers
scantily
clad
were
appearing
from
fore
and
aft
men
overboard
two
of
explained
elliot
in
a
shout
from
the
boat
which
he
was
trying
to
lower
the
first
mate
and
another
man
ran
to
help
him
the
three
of
them
lowered
and
manned
the
boat
gordon
sat
in
the
bow
and
gave
directions
while
the
other
two
put
their
backs
into
the
stroke
quite
casually
elliot
noticed
that
the
man
in
the
waist
had
a
purple
bruise
on
his
left
cheek
bone
the
young
man
himself
had
put
it
there
not
three
minutes
since
across
the
water
came
a
call
for
help
i
sinking
hurry
the
other
man
in
the
river
was
a
dozen
yards
from
the
one
in
distress
with
strong
swift
overhand
strokes
he
shot
through
the
water
all
right
he
called
presently
i
got
him
the
oarsmen
drew
alongside
the
swimmer
with
one
hand
macdonald
caught
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
boat
the
other
clutched
the
rescued
man
by
the
hair
of
his
head
look
out
you
drowning
him
the
mate
warned
am
i
macdonald
glanced
with
mild
interest
at
the
head
that
had
been
until
that
moment
submerged
shows
how
a
man
gets
i
was
thinking
about
how
he
tried
to
drown
me
i
expect
they
dragged
the
miner
aboard
go
ahead
i
swim
down
macdonald
ordered
better
come
aboard
advised
the
mate
no
i
all
right
the
scotchman
pushed
himself
back
from
the
boat
and
fell
into
an
easy
stroke
nevertheless
there
was
power
in
it
for
he
reached
the
hannah
before
the
rescued
miner
had
been
helped
to
the
deck
a
dozen
passengers
crowded
on
the
lower
deck
pushed
forward
eagerly
to
see
among
them
was
selfridge
his
shirt
and
collar
torn
loose
at
the
neck
and
his
immaculate
checked
suit
dusty
and
disheveled
he
was
wearing
a
pair
of
oxford
tans
the
shook
himself
like
a
newfoundland
dog
he
looked
around
with
sardonic
amusement
a
grin
on
his
swollen
and
disfigured
face
quite
a
pleasant
welcome
home
he
said
ironically
his
cold
eyes
fixed
on
a
face
that
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
kicked
by
a
healthy
mule
eh
trelawney
the
cornishman
glared
at
him
and
turned
away
with
a
low
savage
oath
are
you
hurt
mr
macdonald
asked
the
captain
hurt
not
at
all
captain
i
cut
myself
while
i
was
shaving
this
morning
just
a
scratch
was
the
ironic
answer
there
been
some
dirty
work
going
on
i
see
the
men
are
punished
sir
forget
it
captain
i
attend
to
that
little
matter
his
jaunty
almost
insolent
glance
made
the
again
sorry
you
were
too
late
for
the
party
gentlemen
most
of
you
i
see
three
or
four
of
you
who
were
those
present
it
was
a
strictly
exclusive
affair
and
now
if
you
do
mind
i
say
he
turned
on
his
heel
went
up
the
stairway
to
the
deck
above
and
disappeared
into
his
stateroom
the
rescued
miner
propped
against
the
cabin
wall
where
he
had
been
placed
broke
into
sudden
excited
protest
ach
he
tried
to
drown
me
mein
head
he
hold
it
under
the
water
ai
that
just
like
a
swede
retorted
the
mate
in
disgust
mac
saves
his
life
then
the
roughneck
kicks
because
he
got
a
belly
full
of
yukon
sure
mac
soused
him
some
why
should
he
i
ai
no
swede
explained
the
big
miner
sullenly
the
mate
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
explain
that
swede
was
merely
his
generic
term
of
contempt
for
all
foreigners
chapter
iii
the
girl
from
drogheda
gordon
elliot
was
too
much
of
a
night
owl
to
be
an
early
riser
but
next
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
tramp
of
hurried
feet
along
the
deck
to
the
accompaniment
of
brusque
orders
together
with
frequent
angry
puffing
and
snorting
of
the
boat
from
the
quiver
of
the
walls
he
guessed
that
the
hannah
was
stuck
on
a
sandbar
the
mate
language
gave
backing
to
this
surmise
divided
in
mind
between
his
obligation
to
the
sleeping
passengers
and
his
duty
to
get
the
boat
on
her
way
that
officer
spilled
a
good
deal
of
subdued
sulphurous
language
upon
the
situation
all
together
now
get
your
back
into
it
why
are
you
running
around
like
a
chicken
without
a
head
reeves
he
snapped
evidently
the
deck
hands
were
working
to
get
the
hannah
off
by
poling
elliot
tried
to
settle
back
to
sleep
but
after
two
or
three
ineffectual
efforts
gave
it
up
he
rose
and
did
one
or
two
exercises
to
limber
his
joints
the
first
of
these
flashed
the
signal
to
his
brain
that
he
was
stiff
and
sore
this
brought
to
mind
the
fight
on
the
hurricane
deck
and
he
smiled
his
face
was
about
as
mobile
as
if
it
were
in
a
plaster
cast
it
hurt
every
time
he
twitched
a
muscle
the
young
man
stepped
to
the
both
eyes
were
blacked
his
lip
had
been
cut
and
there
was
a
purple
weal
well
up
on
his
left
cheek
he
stopped
himself
from
grinning
only
just
in
time
to
save
another
twinge
of
pain
some
party
while
it
lasted
i
never
saw
more
willing
mixers
everybody
seemed
anxious
to
sit
in
except
wally
selfridge
he
explained
to
his
reflection
but
macdonald
is
the
class
he
there
with
both
right
and
left
that
uppercut
of
his
is
vicious
do
ever
get
in
the
way
of
it
gordon
elliot
he
examined
his
injuries
more
closely
in
the
glass
some
one
landed
a
peach
on
my
right
lamp
and
the
other
is
in
mourning
out
of
sympathy
oh
well
i
ai
the
only
prize
beauty
on
board
this
morning
the
young
man
forgot
and
smiled
ouch
do
do
that
gordon
yes
son
many
a
black
black
eye
they
say
but
none
so
bright
as
mine
now
is
that
the
truth
he
bathed
dressed
and
went
out
on
the
deck
early
though
he
was
one
passenger
at
least
was
up
before
him
the
young
woman
he
had
noticed
last
evening
with
the
magazine
was
doing
a
constitutional
a
slight
breeze
was
stirring
and
as
she
moved
against
it
the
white
skirt
clung
first
to
one
knee
and
then
the
other
moulding
itself
to
the
long
lines
of
her
limbs
with
exquisite
grace
of
motion
it
was
as
though
her
walk
were
the
expression
of
a
gallant
and
buoyant
personality
irish
he
guessed
her
when
the
eyes
rested
on
his
for
an
instant
as
she
passed
and
fortified
his
conjecture
by
the
coloring
of
the
face
and
the
marks
of
the
celtic
race
delicately
stamped
upon
it
the
purser
came
out
of
his
room
and
joined
elliot
he
smiled
at
sight
of
the
young
man
face
your
map
a
little
out
of
plumb
this
morning
sir
he
ventured
but
you
ought
to
see
the
other
fellow
came
back
gordon
boyishly
i
seen
him
several
of
him
we
got
the
best
collection
of
bruises
on
board
i
ever
clapped
eyes
on
i
got
to
give
it
to
you
and
macdonald
you
know
how
to
hit
oh
i
not
in
his
class
gordon
elliot
meant
what
he
said
he
was
himself
an
athlete
had
played
for
three
years
left
tackle
on
his
college
eleven
more
than
one
critic
had
picked
him
for
the
team
he
could
do
his
hundred
in
just
a
little
worse
than
ten
seconds
but
after
all
he
was
a
product
of
training
and
of
the
gymnasiums
macdonald
was
what
nature
and
a
long
line
of
fighting
highland
ancestors
had
made
him
his
sinewy
knotted
strength
his
massive
build
the
breadth
of
shoulder
and
depth
of
chest
mushing
on
long
snow
trails
was
the
gymnasium
that
had
contributed
to
these
the
purser
chuckled
he
a
good
un
mac
is
they
say
he
liked
to
have
drowned
northrup
after
he
had
saved
him
elliot
was
again
following
with
his
eyes
the
lilt
of
the
movements
apparently
he
had
not
heard
what
the
officer
said
at
least
he
gave
no
answer
with
a
grin
the
purser
opened
another
attack
do
blame
you
a
bit
elliot
she
the
prettiest
colleen
that
ever
sailed
from
dublin
bay
the
young
man
brought
his
eyes
home
they
answered
engagingly
the
smile
of
the
purser
who
is
she
the
name
on
the
books
is
sheba
from
dublin

want
to
be
literal
her
baggage

drogheda
ireland

ireland
to
me
where
is
she
bound
for
kusiak
the
young
woman
passed
them
with
a
little
nod
of
morning
greeting
to
the
purser
fine
and
dainty
though
she
was
miss
gave
an
impression
of
radiant
strength
been
with
you
all
the
way
up
the
river
asked
elliot
after
she
had
passed
yep
she
came
up
on
the
skagit
from
seattle
what
is
she
going
to
do
at
kusiak

the
purser
grinned
what

thing

know
girls
coming
up
ask
me

six
weeks
and

favorite
wedding

said
the
officer
lightly
but
she
never
get
out
of
alaska
a
spinster
not
that
girl
she
may
be
going
in
to
teach
or
to
run
a
millinery
store
or
to
keep
books
for
a
trading
company
she
stay
to
bring
up
kiddies
of
her
own
they
all
do
three
children
came
up
the
stairway
caught
sight
of
miss
and
raced
across
the
deck
to
her
the
young
woman
face
was
transformed
it
was
bubbling
with
tenderness
with
gay
and
happy
laughter
flinging
her
arms
wide
she
waited
for
them
with
incoherent
cries
of
delight
they
flung
themselves
upon
her
her
arms
enveloped
all
three
as
she
stooped
for
their
hugs
and
kisses
the
two
oldest
were
girls
the
youngest
was
a
fat
cuddly
little
boy
with
dimples
in
his
soft
cheeks
i
dwessed
myself
aunt
sheba
did
i
gwen
not
all
by
yourself
billie
inquired
the
irish
girl
registering
a
proper
amazement
he
nodded
his
head
slowly
and
solemnly
up
and
down
honeth
to
goodness
sheba
stooped
and
held
him
off
to
admire
all
by
yourself
just
think
of
that
we
helped
just
the
teeniest
bit
on
the
buttons
confessed
janet
the
oldest
of
the
small
family
and
i
tied
his
shoes
added
gwendolen
after
he
had
laced
them
billie
will
be
such
a
big
man
daddie
wo
know
him
and
sheba
gave
him
another
hug
gwendolen
snuggled
close
to
miss
you
always
smell
so
sweet
and
clean
and
violety
aunt
sheba
she
whispered
in
confidence
you
spoiling
me
gwen
laughed
the
young
woman
you
kissed
the
blarney
stone
it
a
good
thing
you
leaving
the
boat
miss
gwen
had
one
more
confidence
to
make
in
the
ear
of
her
friend
i
wish
you
come
too
and
be
our
new
mamma
she
begged
a
tinge
crept
into
the
milky
skin
of
the
irish
girl
she
was
less
sure
of
herself
more
easily
embarrassed
than
the
average
american
of
her
age
and
sex
occasionally
in
her
manner
was
that
effect
of
shyness
one
finds
in
the
british
even
after
they
have
escaped
from
provincialism
are
all
your
things
gathered
ready
for
packing
janet
she
asked
quietly
the
purser
gave
information
to
elliot
they
call
her
aunt
sheba
but
she
no
relative
of
theirs
the
kids
are
on
their
way
in
to
their
father
who
is
an
engineer
on
one
of
the
creeks
back
of
katma
their
mother
died
two
months
ago
miss
met
them
first
aboard
the
skagit
on
the
way
up
and
she
has
mothered
them
ever
since
some
women
are
that
way
bless
i
know
because
i
been
married
to
one
myself
six
months
she
back
there
at
michael
and
she
just
grabs
at
every
baby
in
the
block
the
eyes
of
elliot
rested
on
miss
she
loves
children
she
sure
does
no
bluff
about
that
an
imp
of
mischief
sparkled
in
the
eye
of
the
supercargo
not
married
yourself
are
you
mr
elliot
no
hmp
that
was
all
he
said
but
gordon
felt
the
blood
creep
into
his
face
this
annoyed
him
so
he
added
brusquely
and
not
likely
to
be
when
the
call
for
breakfast
came
miss
took
her
retinue
of
youngsters
with
her
to
the
looking
across
from
his
seat
at
an
adjoining
table
elliot
could
see
her
waiting
upon
them
with
a
fine
absorption
in
their
needs
she
prepared
an
orange
for
billie
and
offered
to
the
little
girls
suggestions
as
to
ordering
that
were
accepted
by
them
as
a
matter
of
course
unconsciously
the
children
recognized
in
her
the
eternal
mother
before
they
had
been
long
in
the
macdonald
came
in
carrying
a
sheaf
of
business
papers
he
glanced
around
recognized
elliot
and
made
instantly
for
the
seat
across
the
table
from
him
on
his
face
and
head
were
many
marks
of
the
recent
battle
trade
you
a
cauliflower
ear
for
a
pair
of
black
eyes
elliot
he
laughed
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
man
whose
name
he
had
just
learned
from
the
purser
the
grip
of
his
brown
muscular
hand
was
strong
it
was
in
character
with
the
steady
cool
eyes
set
deep
beneath
the
jutting
forehead
with
the
confident
carriage
of
the
deep
broad
shoulders
he
looked
a
dynamic
american
who
trod
the
way
of
the
forceful
and
fought
for
his
share
of
the
spoils
you
might
throw
in
several
other
little
souvenirs
to
boot
and
not
miss
them
suggested
elliot
with
a
smile
macdonald
nodded
indifferently
i
gave
and
i
took
which
was
as
it
should
be
but
it
different
with
you
elliot
this
was
your
row
i
had
been
in
a
good
since
i
left
college
it
did
me
a
lot
of
good
much
obliged
anyhow
he
turned
his
attention
to
a
lady
entering
the
selfridge
how
wally
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
despair
he
on
his
second
bottle
of
liniment
already
i
expect
those
ruffians
have
ruined
his
singing
voice
it
a
mercy
they
did
murder
both
him
and
you
macdonald
when
i
think
of
how
close
you
both
came
to
death
last
night
i
do
know
about
wally
but
i
had
no
notion
of
dying
selfridge
they
mussed
us
up
a
bit
that
was
all
but
they
to
kill
you
the
cowards
and
they
almost
did
it
too
look
at
wally
confined
to
his
bed
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
look
at
you
a
wreck
horribly
beaten
up
almost
drowned
we
must
drive
the
villains
out
of
the
country
or
send
them
to
prison
selfridge
always
talked
in
superlatives
she
had
an
enthusiasm
for
the
dramatics
of
conversation
her
supple
hands
her
shrill
eager
voice
the
snapping
black
eyes
all
had
the
effect
of
startling
headlines
to
the
story
she
might
be
telling
am
i
a
wreck
the
big
scotchman
wanted
to
know
i
feel
as
husky
as
a
malamute
oh
you
but
we
all
know
you
how
brave
and
strong
you
are
that
why
this
outrage
ought
to
be
punished
what
would
alaska
do
if
anything
happened
to
you
i
had
thought
of
that
admitted
macdonald
the
north
would
have
to
go
out
of
business
i
suppose
but
you
right
about
one
thing
selfridge
i
brave
and
strong
enough
at
the
breakfast
table
steward
will
you
bring
me
a
double
order
of
these
shirred
eggs
and
a
small
steak
well
i
glad
you
can
still
joke
macdonald
after
such
a
terrible
experience
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
hope
wally
is
permanently
injured
he
has
your
fine
constitution
and
one
never
can
tell
about
internal
injuries
selfridge
sighed
and
passed
to
her
place
the
eyes
of
the
big
man
twinkled
our
little
fracas
has
been
a
godsend
to
selfridge
wally
and
i
will
both
emerge
as
heroes
of
a
desperate
struggle
you
wo
even
get
a
mention
but
it
a
pity
about
injuries
and
his
singing
voice
the
younger
man
agreed
with
a
gravity
back
of
which
his
amusement
was
apparent
the
share
of
selfridge
in
the
battle
had
been
limited
to
leg
work
only
but
this
had
not
been
good
enough
to
keep
him
from
being
overhauled
and
having
his
throat
squeezed
elliot
finished
breakfast
first
and
left
macdonald
looking
over
a
long
typewritten
document
he
had
it
propped
against
a
and
was
reading
as
he
ate
the
paper
was
a
report
selfridge
had
brought
in
to
him
from
a
clerk
in
the
general
land
office
the
big
canadian
and
the
men
he
represented
were
dealing
directly
with
the
heads
of
the
government
departments
but
they
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
keep
in
their
employ
subordinates
in
the
capacity
of
secret
service
agents
to
spy
upon
the
chapter
iv
the
crevasse
for
an
hour
before
the
hannah
reached
katma
miss
was
busy
getting
her
little
brood
ready
in
that
last
she
was
a
creature
of
moods
to
them
they
too
like
sheba
herself
were
adventuring
into
a
new
world
somehow
they
represented
to
her
the
last
tie
that
bound
her
to
the
life
she
was
leaving
her
heart
was
tender
as
a
madonna
to
these
lambs
so
to
face
a
frigid
waste
their
mother
had
been
a
good
woman
she
could
tell
that
but
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
kind
of
man
their
father
might
be
sheba
gave
janet
advice
about
where
to
keep
her
money
and
when
to
wear
rubbers
and
what
to
do
for
billie
cold
she
put
up
a
lunch
for
them
to
take
on
the
stage
when
they
said
their
sniffling
at
katma
she
was
suspiciously
bright
and
merry
soon
the
children
were
laughing
again
with
her
one
glance
at
their
father
who
introduced
himself
to
miss
as
john
husted
relieved
her
mind
greatly
his
spontaneous
delight
at
seeing
them
again
and
his
choking
gratitude
to
her
for
having
looked
after
them
were
evidence
enough
that
this
man
meant
to
be
both
father
and
mother
to
his
recovered
little
folks
his
emotion
was
too
poignant
for
him
to
talk
about
his
wife
but
sheba
understood
and
liked
him
better
for
it
her
temporary
family
stood
on
the
end
of
the
wharf
and
called
to
the
girl
tum
soon
and
see
us
aunt
sheba
billie
shouted
from
his
seat
on
the
shoulder
of
his
father
the
children
waved
handkerchiefs
as
long
as
she
could
be
distinguished
by
them
when
they
turned
away
she
went
directly
to
her
room
elliot
was
passing
forward
when
miss
opened
her
stateroom
door
to
go
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
woman
were
blind
with
tears
and
she
was
biting
her
lip
to
keep
back
the
emotion
that
welled
up
he
knew
she
was
very
fond
of
the
motherless
children
but
he
guessed
at
an
additional
reason
for
her
sobs
she
too
was
as
untaught
as
a
child
in
the
life
of
this
frontier
land
whatever
she
found
here
how
much
of
hardship
or
happiness
of
grief
or
woe
she
knew
that
she
had
left
behind
forever
the
safe
harborage
of
quiet
waters
in
which
her
life
craft
had
always
floated
it
came
on
to
rain
in
the
afternoon
heavy
clouds
swept
across
from
the
mountains
and
the
sodden
sky
opened
like
a
the
kusiak
contingent
driven
indoors
resorted
to
bridge
miss
read
gordon
elliot
wrote
letters
dawdled
over
magazines
and
lounged
alternately
in
the
ladies
parlor
and
the
where
macdonald
strong
a
hardware
merchant
from
fairbanks
and
a
pair
of
miners
had
settled
themselves
to
a
poker
game
that
was
to
last
all
night
and
well
into
the
next
day
of
the
two
bridge
tables
all
the
players
were
except
mallory
most
of
them
were
young
enough
in
years
but
they
had
been
of
the
north
long
enough
to
know
the
gossip
of
the
country
and
its
small
politics
intimately
they
shared
common
hopes
of
the
day
when
alaska
would
be
thrown
open
to
industry
and
a
large
population
but
mallory
had
come
in
over
the
ice
for
the
first
time
last
winter
the
other
women
felt
that
she
was
a
bird
of
passage
that
the
frozen
arctic
could
be
no
more
than
a
whim
to
her
they
deferred
a
little
to
her
because
she
knew
the
great
world
new
york
vienna
london
paris
great
names
fell
from
her
lips
casually
and
carelessly
she
referred
familiarly
to
princes
and
famous
statesmen
as
if
she
had
gossiped
with
them
over
the
teacups
she
was
full
of
spicy
little
anecdotes
about
german
royalty
and
the
british
aristocracy
it
was
no
wonder
gordon
elliot
thought
that
she
had
rather
stunned
the
little
social
set
of
kusiak
through
northrup
and
trelawney
a
new
slant
on
macdonald
was
given
to
gordon
he
had
fallen
into
casual
talk
with
them
after
dinner
on
the
fore
deck
it
was
still
raining
but
all
three
were
equipped
with
slickers
or
mackintoshes
to
his
surprise
the
young
man
discovered
that
they
bore
him
no
grudge
at
all
for
his
interference
the
night
before
but
we
ai
through
with
colby
macdonald
yet
trelawney
explained
mind
i
do
say
we
going
to
get
him
nothing
like
that
he
knocked
me
cold
with
that
loaded
suitcase
of
his
by
the
looks
of
him
i
even
for
that
good
enough
but
here
the
point
we
stand
for
labor
he
stands
for
capital
see
things
ai
what
they
used
to
be
in
alaska
and
it
because
of
colby
macdonald
and
his
friends
grabbers
that
what
they
are
they
want
the
whole
works
a
hell
of
a
roar
goes
up
from
them
when
the
government
stops
their
combines
but
all
the
time
they
bearing
down
a
little
harder
on
us
workingmen
understand
it
up
to
us
to
fight
ai
it
later
elliot
put
this
viewpoint
before
strong
there
something
in
it
the
miner
agreed
wages
have
gone
down
and
it
partly
because
the
big
fellows
are
consolidating
interests
alaska
ai
a
poor
man
country
the
way
it
was
but
mac
ai
to
blame
for
that
he
has
to
play
the
game
the
way
the
cards
are
dealt
out
the
sky
was
clear
again
when
the
hannah
drew
in
to
the
wharf
at
moose
head
to
unload
freight
but
the
mud
in
the
unpaved
street
leading
to
the
business
section
of
the
little
frontier
town
was
instep
deep
many
of
the
passengers
hurried
ashore
to
make
the
most
of
the
stop
macdonald
with
mallory
and
their
kusiak
friends
disappeared
in
a
bus
elliot
put
on
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
and
started
uptown
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
he
passed
miss
she
wore
no
rubbers
and
she
had
come
to
a
halt
at
the
beginning
of
the
mud
after
a
momentary
indecision
she
returned
slowly
to
the
boat
the
young
man
walked
up
into
the
town
but
ten
minutes
later
he
crossed
the
gangplank
of
the
hannah
again
with
a
package
under
his
arm
miss
was
sitting
on
the
forward
deck
making
a
pretense
to
herself
of
reading
this
was
where
elliot
had
expected
to
find
her
but
now
that
the
moment
of
attack
had
come
he
had
to
take
his
fear
by
the
throat
when
he
had
thought
of
it
first
there
seemed
nothing
difficult
about
offering
to
do
her
a
kindness
yet
he
found
himself
shrinking
from
the
chance
of
a
rebuff
he
moved
over
to
where
she
sat
and
lifted
his
hat
i
hope
you
think
it
a
liberty
miss
but
i
brought
you
some
rubbers
from
a
store
uptown
i
noticed
you
could
get
ashore
without
them
gordon
tore
the
paper
wrapping
from
his
package
and
disclosed
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
rubbers
the
girl
was
visibly
embarrassed
she
was
not
at
all
certain
of
the
right
thing
to
do
where
she
had
been
brought
up
young
men
did
not
offer
courtesies
of
this
sort
so
informally
i
i
think
i
wo
need
them
thank
you
i
decided
not
to
leave
the
boat
she
answered
shyly
elliot
had
never
been
accused
of
being
a
quitter
having
begun
this
he
proposed
to
see
it
out
he
caught
sight
of
the
purser
superintending
the
discharge
of
cargo
and
called
to
him
by
name
the
officer
joined
them
a
pad
of
paper
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
i
trying
to
persuade
miss
that
she
ought
to
go
ashore
while
we
lying
here
what
was
it
you
told
me
about
the
waterfall
back
of
the
town
finest
thing
of
its
kind
in
alaska
they
so
proud
of
it
in
this
burg
that
they
would
like
to
make
it
against
the
law
for
any
one
to
leave
without
seeing
it
every
one
takes
it
in
we
wo
get
away
till
night
you
plenty
of
time
if
you
want
to
see
it
now
will
you
please
introduce
me
to
miss
formally
the
purser
went
through
the
usual
formula
of
presentation
adding
that
elliot
was
a
government
official
on
his
way
to
kusiak
having
done
his
duty
by
the
young
man
the
busy
supercargo
retired
i
sure
it
would
do
you
good
to
walk
up
to
the
waterfall
with
me
miss
urged
elliot
she
met
a
little
dubiously
the
smile
that
would
not
stay
quite
extinguished
on
his
boyish
face
why
should
she
go
with
him
since
it
was
the
american
way
for
unchaperoned
youth
to
enjoy
itself
naturally
if
they
fit
the
girl
answered
eyeing
the
rubbers
gordon
dropped
to
his
knee
and
demonstrated
that
they
would
as
they
walked
along
the
muddy
street
she
gave
him
a
friendly
little
nod
of
thanks
good
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
to
look
out
for
me
he
laughed
it
was
myself
i
was
looking
out
for
i
a
stranger
in
the
country
and
was
awfully
lonesome
is
it
that
this
is
your
first
time
in
too
she
asked
shyly
you
going
to
kusiak
are
you
do
you
know
anybody
there
replied
elliot
my
cousin
lives
there
but
i
have
seen
her
since
i
was
ten
she
an
american
eleven
years
ago
she
visited
us
in
ireland
i
glad
you
know
some
one
he
said
you
not
be
so
lonesome
with
some
of
your
people
living
there
i
have
two
friends
at
kusiak
a
girl
i
used
to
go
to
school
with
and
her
husband
are
you
going
to
live
at
kusiak
no
but
i
be
stationed
in
the
territory
for
several
months
i
be
in
and
out
of
the
town
a
good
deal
i
hope
you
let
me
see
something
of
you
the
fine
irish
coloring
deepened
in
her
cheeks
he
had
a
way
of
taking
in
his
stride
the
barriers
between
them
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
feel
offended
at
this
cheery
vigorous
young
fellow
with
the
winning
smile
and
the
jaw
she
liked
the
warmth
in
his
honest
brown
eyes
she
liked
the
play
of
muscular
grace
beneath
his
clothes
the
sinuous
ease
of
his
lean
body
stirred
faintly
some
primitive
instinct
in
her
maiden
heart
sheba
did
not
know
as
her
resilient
muscles
carried
her
forward
joyfully
that
she
was
answering
the
call
of
youth
to
youth
gordon
respected
her
shyness
and
moved
warily
to
establish
his
contact
he
let
the
talk
drift
to
impersonal
topics
as
they
picked
their
way
out
from
the
town
along
the
mossy
trail
the
ground
was
spongy
with
water
on
either
side
of
them
ferns
and
brakes
grew
lush
sheba
took
the
porous
path
with
a
step
elastic
to
the
young
man
following
she
seemed
a
miracle
of
supple
lightness
the
trail
tilted
up
from
the
lowlands
led
across
dips
and
into
a
draw
a
little
stream
meandered
down
and
gurgled
over
rocks
worn
smooth
by
ages
of
attrition
alders
brushed
the
stream
and
their
foliage
checkered
the
trail
with
sunlight
and
shadow
they
were
ascending
steadily
now
along
a
pathway
almost
too
indistinct
to
follow
the
air
was
aromatic
with
pine
from
a
grove
that
came
straggling
down
the
side
of
a
gulch
to
the
brook
do
you
know
i
have
a
queer
feeling
that
i
seen
all
this
before
the
irish
girl
said
of
course
i
have
unless
it
was
in
my
dreams
naturally
i
thought
about
alaska
a
great
deal
because
my
father
lived
here
i
did
know
that
yes
he
came
in
with
the
klondike
stampeders
she
added
quietly
he
died
on
bonanza
creek
two
years
later
was
he
a
miner
not
until
he
came
north
he
had
an
interest
in
a
claim
it
later
turned
out
worthless
a
bit
of
stiff
climbing
brought
them
to
a
boulder
field
back
of
which
rose
a
mountain
ridge
we
got
off
the
trail
somehow
elliot
said
but
i
do
suppose
it
matters
if
we
keep
going
we
bound
to
come
to
the
waterfall
beyond
the
boulder
field
the
ridge
rose
sharply
gordon
looked
a
little
dubiously
at
sheba
are
you
a
good
climber
as
she
stood
in
the
sunpour
her
cheeks
flushed
with
exercise
he
could
see
that
her
spirit
courted
adventure
i
sure
i
must
be
she
answered
with
a
smile
adorable
i
believe
i
could
do
the
matterhorn
well
up
on
the
shoulder
of
the
ridge
they
stopped
to
breathe
the
distant
noise
of
falling
water
came
faintly
to
them
we
too
far
to
the
left
must
have
followed
the
wrong
spur
elliot
explained
probably
we
can
cut
across
the
face
of
the
mountain
presently
they
came
to
an
impasse
the
gulch
between
the
two
spurs
terminated
in
a
rock
wall
that
fell
almost
sheer
for
two
hundred
feet
the
color
in
the
cheeks
beneath
the
eager
eyes
of
the
girl
was
warm
let
try
it
she
begged
the
young
man
had
noticed
that
she
was
as
as
a
mountain
goat
and
that
she
could
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
without
dizziness
the
surface
of
the
wall
was
broken
what
it
might
be
beyond
he
could
not
tell
but
the
first
fifty
feet
was
a
bit
of
attractive
and
not
too
difficult
rock
traverse
now
and
again
he
made
a
suggestion
to
the
young
woman
following
him
but
for
the
most
part
he
trusted
her
to
choose
her
own
foot
and
hand
holds
her
delicacy
was
silken
strong
if
she
was
slender
she
was
yet
the
movements
of
the
girl
were
as
certain
as
those
of
an
experienced
mountaineer
the
way
grew
more
difficult
they
had
been
following
a
ledge
that
narrowed
till
it
ran
out
jutting
knobs
of
feldspar
and
stunted
shrubs
growing
from
crevices
offered
instead
of
the
even
foothold
of
the
rock
shelf
as
gordon
looked
down
at
the
dizzy
fall
beneath
them
his
judgment
told
him
they
had
better
go
back
he
said
as
much
to
his
companion
the
smile
she
flashed
at
him
was
delightfully
provocative
it
served
to
point
the
figure
she
borrowed
from
gwen
so
you
think
i
a
mr
elliot
his
inclination
marched
with
hers
it
was
their
first
adventure
together
and
he
did
not
want
to
spoil
it
by
undue
caution
there
really
was
not
much
danger
yet
so
long
as
they
were
careful
gordon
abandoned
the
traverse
and
followed
an
ascending
crack
in
the
wall
the
going
was
hard
it
called
for
endurance
and
muscle
as
well
as
for
a
steady
head
and
a
sure
foot
he
looked
down
at
the
girl
wedged
between
the
slopes
of
the
granite
trough
she
read
his
thought
the
old
guard
never
surrenders
sir
was
her
quick
answer
as
she
brushed
in
salute
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
a
stray
lock
of
hair
the
trough
was
worse
than
elliot
had
expected
it
had
in
it
a
good
deal
of
loose
rubble
that
started
in
small
slides
at
the
least
pressure
be
very
careful
of
your
footing
he
called
back
anxiously
a
small
grassy
platform
lay
above
the
upper
end
of
the
trough
but
the
last
dozen
feet
of
the
approach
was
a
very
difficult
bit
gordon
took
advantage
of
every
least
projection
he
fought
his
way
up
with
his
back
against
one
wall
and
his
knees
pressed
to
the
other
three
feet
short
of
the
platform
the
rock
walls
became
absolutely
smooth
the
climber
could
reach
within
a
foot
of
the
top
are
you
stopped
asked
sheba
looks
that
way
a
small
pine
projected
from
the
edge
of
the
shelf
out
over
the
precipice
it
might
be
strong
enough
to
bear
his
weight
it
might
not
gordon
unbuckled
his
belt
and
threw
one
end
over
the
trunk
of
the
dwarf
tree
gingerly
he
tested
it
with
his
weight
then
went
up
hand
over
hand
and
worked
himself
over
the
edge
of
the
little
plateau
all
right
the
girl
called
up
all
right
but
you
ca
make
it
i
coming
down
again
i
going
to
try
i
would
miss
it
really
dangerous
i
like
to
try
it
i
stop
if
it
too
hard
she
promised
the
strength
of
her
slender
wrists
surprised
him
she
struggled
up
the
vertical
crevasse
inch
by
inch
his
heart
was
full
of
fear
for
a
misstep
now
would
be
fatal
he
lay
down
with
his
face
over
the
ledge
and
lowered
to
her
the
buckled
loop
of
his
belt
twice
she
stopped
exhausted
her
back
and
her
hands
pressed
against
the
walls
of
the
trough
angle
for
support
better
give
it
up
he
advised
i
not
then
she
smiled
stubbornly
as
she
shook
her
head
presently
her
fingers
touched
the
belt
illustration
so
you
think
i
a
mr
elliot
gordon
edged
forward
an
inch
or
two
farther
put
your
hand
through
the
loop
and
catch
hold
of
the
leather
above
he
told
her
she
did
so
and
at
the
same
instant
her
foot
slipped
the
girl
swung
out
into
space
suspended
by
one
wrist
the
muscles
of
elliot
hardened
into
steel
as
they
responded
to
the
strain
his
body
began
to
slide
very
slowly
down
the
incline
in
a
moment
the
acute
danger
was
past
sheba
had
found
a
hold
with
her
feet
and
relieved
somewhat
the
dead
pull
upon
elliot
she
had
not
voiced
a
cry
but
the
face
that
looked
up
into
his
was
very
white
take
your
time
he
said
in
a
quiet
way
with
his
help
she
came
close
enough
for
him
to
reach
her
hand
after
that
it
was
only
a
moment
before
she
knelt
on
the
plateau
beside
him
touch
and
go
was
it
sheba
tried
to
smile
but
the
colorless
lips
told
the
young
man
she
was
still
faint
from
the
shock
he
knew
he
was
going
to
reproach
himself
bitterly
for
having
led
her
into
such
a
risk
but
he
could
not
just
now
afford
to
waste
his
energies
on
regrets
nor
could
he
let
her
mind
dwell
on
past
dangers
so
long
as
there
were
future
ones
to
be
faced
you
might
have
sprained
your
wrist
he
said
lightly
as
he
rose
to
examine
the
cliff
still
to
be
negotiated
her
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
with
quick
surprise
so
i
might
she
answered
dryly
but
his
indifferent
tone
had
the
effect
upon
her
of
a
plunge
into
cold
water
it
braced
and
stiffened
her
will
if
he
wanted
to
ignore
the
terrible
danger
through
which
she
had
passed
certainly
she
was
not
going
to
remind
him
of
it
between
where
they
stood
and
the
summit
of
the
cliff
was
another
rock
traverse
a
kind
of
rough
natural
stairway
led
down
to
a
point
opposite
them
but
before
this
could
be
reached
thirty
feet
of
granite
must
be
crossed
the
wall
looked
hazardous
enough
in
all
faith
it
lay
in
the
shade
and
there
were
spots
where
a
thin
coating
of
ice
covered
the
smooth
slabs
but
there
was
no
other
way
up
and
if
the
traverse
could
be
made
the
rest
was
easy
gordon
was
mountaineer
enough
to
know
that
the
climb
up
is
safer
than
the
one
back
the
only
possible
way
for
them
to
go
down
the
trough
was
for
him
to
lower
her
by
the
belt
until
she
found
footing
enough
to
go
alone
he
did
not
quite
admit
it
to
himself
but
in
his
heart
he
doubted
whether
she
could
make
it
safely
the
alternative
was
the
cliff
face
chapter
v
across
the
traverse
elliot
took
off
his
shoes
and
turned
toward
the
traverse
think
i
see
if
i
can
cross
to
that
stairway
you
had
better
wait
here
miss
until
we
find
out
if
it
can
be
done
his
manner
was
casual
his
voice
studiously
light
sheba
looked
across
the
cliff
and
down
to
the
boulder
bed
two
hundred
feet
below
you
can
never
do
it
in
the
world
is
there
another
way
up
no
the
wall
above
us
slopes
out
i
got
to
cross
to
the
stairway
if
i
make
it
i
going
to
get
a
rope
do
you
mean
you
going
back
to
town
for
one
yes
her
eyes
fastened
to
his
in
a
long
unspoken
question
she
read
the
answer
he
was
afraid
to
have
her
try
the
trough
again
to
get
back
to
town
by
way
of
their
roundabout
ascent
would
waste
time
if
he
was
going
to
rescue
her
before
night
he
must
take
the
shortest
cut
and
that
was
across
the
face
of
the
sheer
cliff
for
the
first
time
she
understood
how
serious
was
their
plight
we
can
go
back
together
by
the
trough
ca
we
but
even
as
she
asked
her
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
facing
again
that
dizzy
height
the
moment
of
horror
when
she
had
thought
herself
lost
had
shaken
her
nerve
it
would
be
difficult
the
glance
of
the
girl
swept
again
the
face
of
the
wall
he
must
cross
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
rope
her
eyes
came
back
to
his
it
my
fault
i
made
you
come
she
said
in
a
low
voice
nonsense
he
answered
cheerfully
there
no
harm
done
if
i
reach
the
stairway
i
can
come
back
and
go
down
by
the
trough
sheba
assented
doubtfully
it
had
come
on
to
drizzle
again
the
rain
was
fine
and
cold
almost
a
mist
and
already
it
was
forming
a
film
of
ice
on
the
rocks
i
ca
take
time
to
go
back
by
the
trough
the
point
is
that
i
want
you
camped
up
here
after
night
there
has
been
no
sun
on
this
side
of
the
spur
and
in
the
chill
of
the
evening
it
must
get
cold
even
in
summer
he
was
making
his
preparations
as
he
talked
his
coat
he
took
off
and
threw
down
his
shoes
he
tied
by
the
laces
to
his
belt
i
try
not
to
be
very
long
he
promised
it
god
will
then
so
it
is
she
sighed
relapsing
into
the
vernacular
her
voice
was
low
and
not
very
steady
for
the
heart
of
the
girl
was
heavy
she
knew
she
must
not
protest
his
decision
that
was
not
the
way
to
play
the
game
but
somehow
the
salt
had
gone
from
their
adventure
she
had
become
panicky
from
the
moment
when
her
feet
had
started
the
rubble
in
the
trough
and
gone
flying
into
the
air
the
gayety
that
had
been
the
note
of
their
tramp
had
given
place
to
fears
elliot
took
her
little
hand
in
a
warm
strong
grip
you
not
going
to
be
afraid
we
work
out
all
right
you
know
yes
it
not
just
the
thing
to
leave
a
lady
in
the
rain
when
you
take
her
for
a
walk
but
it
ca
be
helped
we
laugh
about
it
would
they
she
wondered
answering
his
smile
faintly
her
courage
was
sapped
she
wanted
to
cry
out
that
he
must
not
try
the
traverse
but
she
set
her
will
not
to
make
it
harder
for
him
he
turned
to
the
climb
you
forgotten
your
coat
she
reminded
i
traveling
light
this
trip
you
better
slip
it
on
before
you
get
chilled
sheba
knew
he
had
left
it
on
purpose
for
her
her
fascinated
eyes
followed
him
while
he
moved
out
from
the
plateau
across
the
face
of
the
precipice
his
hand
had
found
a
knob
of
projecting
feldspar
and
he
was
feeling
with
his
right
foot
for
a
hold
in
some
moss
that
grew
in
a
crevice
he
had
none
of
the
tools
for
climbing
no
rope
no
hatchet
none
of
the
support
of
numbers
all
the
allies
he
could
summon
were
his
bare
hands
and
feet
his
resilient
muscles
and
his
stout
heart
to
make
it
worse
the
ice
film
from
the
rain
coated
every
jutting
inch
of
quartz
with
danger
but
he
worked
steadily
forward
moving
with
the
infinite
caution
of
one
who
knows
that
there
will
be
no
chance
to
remedy
later
any
mistake
a
slight
error
in
judgment
the
failure
in
response
of
any
one
of
fifty
muscles
would
send
him
plunging
down
occasionally
he
spoke
to
sheba
but
she
volunteered
no
remarks
it
was
her
part
to
wait
and
watch
while
he
concentrated
every
faculty
upon
his
task
he
had
come
to
an
impasse
after
crossing
a
dozen
feet
of
the
wall
and
was
working
up
to
get
around
a
slab
of
granite
which
protruded
a
convex
barrier
from
the
surface
of
the
cliff
it
struck
the
girl
that
from
a
distance
he
must
look
like
a
fly
on
a
pane
of
glass
even
to
her
close
as
she
was
that
smooth
rock
surface
looked
impossible
her
eye
left
him
for
an
instant
to
sweep
the
gulf
below
she
gave
a
little
cry
ran
to
his
coat
and
began
to
wave
it
for
the
first
time
since
elliot
had
begun
the
traverse
she
took
the
initiative
in
speech
i
see
some
people
away
over
to
the
left
elliot
i
going
to
call
to
them
her
voice
throbbed
with
hope
but
it
was
not
her
shouts
or
his
which
would
not
have
carried
one
tenth
the
distance
that
reached
the
group
in
the
valley
one
of
them
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
wildly
waving
coat
there
was
a
consultation
and
two
or
three
fluttered
handkerchiefs
in
response
presently
they
moved
on
sheba
could
not
believe
her
eyes
they
not
leaving
us
surely
she
gasped
that
what
they
doing
answered
gordon
grimly
they
think
calling
to
them
out
of
vanity
to
show
them
where
we
climbed
oh
she
strangled
a
sob
in
her
throat
her
heart
was
weighted
as
with
lead
i
going
to
make
it
i
think
i
see
my
way
from
here
her
companion
called
across
to
her
a
fault
runs
to
the
foot
of
the
stairway
if
i
can
only
do
the
next
yard
or
two
he
did
them
by
throwing
caution
to
the
winds
an
icy
rounded
boulder
projected
above
him
out
of
reach
he
unfastened
his
belt
again
and
put
the
shoes
tied
by
the
laces
around
his
neck
there
was
one
way
to
get
across
to
the
ledge
of
the
fault
he
took
hold
of
the
two
ends
of
the
belt
crouched
and
leaned
forward
on
tiptoes
toward
the
knob
the
loop
of
the
belt
slid
over
the
boss
there
was
no
chance
to
draw
back
now
to
test
the
hold
he
had
gained
if
the
leather
slipped
he
was
lost
his
body
swung
across
the
abyss
and
his
feet
landed
on
the
little
ledge
beyond
his
shout
of
success
came
perhaps
ten
minutes
later
i
reached
the
stairway
miss
i
try
not
to
be
long
but
you
better
exercise
to
keep
up
the
circulation
do
worry
please
i
be
back
before
night
i
so
glad
she
cried
joyfully
i
was
afraid
for
you
and
i
not
worry
a
bit
elliot
made
his
way
up
to
the
summit
and
ran
along
a
footpath
which
brought
him
to
a
bridge
across
the
mountain
stream
just
above
the
falls
the
trail
zigzagged
down
the
turbulent
little
river
close
to
the
bank
before
he
had
specialized
on
the
short
distances
gordon
had
been
a
runner
he
was
in
fair
condition
and
he
covered
the
ground
fast
about
a
mile
below
the
falls
he
met
two
men
one
of
them
was
colby
macdonald
he
carried
a
coil
of
rope
over
one
shoulder
the
big
alaskan
explained
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
it
out
of
his
head
that
perhaps
the
climbers
who
had
waved
at
his
party
had
been
in
difficulties
so
he
had
got
a
rope
from
the
cabin
of
an
old
miner
and
was
on
his
way
back
to
the
falls
the
three
climbed
to
the
falls
crossed
the
bridge
and
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
you
know
the
lay
of
the
land
down
there
elliot
we
lower
you
decided
macdonald
who
took
command
as
a
matter
of
course
gordon
presently
stood
beside
sheba
on
the
little
plateau
she
had
quite
recovered
from
the
touch
of
hysteria
that
had
attacked
her
courage
the
wind
and
the
rain
had
whipped
the
color
into
her
soft
cheeks
had
disarranged
a
little
the
crinkly
hair
wet
tendrils
of
which
nestled
against
her
temples
the
health
and
buoyancy
of
the
girl
were
in
the
live
eyes
that
met
his
eagerly
you
were
long
was
all
she
said
i
met
them
coming
he
answered
as
he
dropped
the
loop
of
the
rope
over
her
head
and
arranged
it
under
her
shoulders
he
showed
her
how
to
relieve
part
of
the
strain
of
the
rope
on
her
flesh
by
using
her
hands
to
lift
all
ready
macdonald
called
from
above
all
ready
elliot
answered
to
sheba
he
said
hold
tight
the
girl
was
swung
from
the
ledge
and
rose
jerkily
in
the
air
she
laughed
gayly
down
at
her
friend
below
it
fun
gordon
followed
her
a
couple
of
minutes
later
she
was
waiting
to
give
him
a
hand
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
miss
this
is
macdonald
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
freed
himself
from
the
rope
you
are
fellow
passengers
on
the
hannah
macdonald
was
looking
at
her
straight
and
hard
your
father
name
was
it
farrell
he
asked
bluntly
yes
i
knew
him
the
girl
eyes
lit
i
glad
macdonald
that
one
reason
i
wanted
to
come
to
alaska
to
hear
about
my
father
life
here
will
you
tell
me
sometime
we
must
be
going
now
to
catch
the
boat
after
i
had
a
look
at
the
cliff
this
young
man
crawled
across
he
turned
away
abruptly
it
struck
elliot
and
climbed
down
the
natural
stairway
up
which
the
young
man
had
come
presently
he
rejoined
those
above
macdonald
looked
at
elliot
with
a
new
respect
you
in
luck
my
friend
that
we
not
carrying
you
from
the
foot
of
the
cliff
he
said
dryly
i
would
cross
that
rock
wall
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cold
cash
nor
i
again
admitted
gordon
with
a
laugh
but
we
had
either
to
homestead
that
plateau
or
vacate
it
i
preferred
the
latter
miss
deep
eyes
looked
at
him
she
was
about
to
speak
then
changed
her
mind
chapter
vi
sheba
sings
and
two
men
listen
elliot
did
not
see
miss
next
morning
until
she
appeared
in
the
for
breakfast
he
timed
himself
to
get
through
so
as
to
join
her
when
she
left
they
strolled
out
to
the
deck
together
did
you
sleep
well
he
asked
after
i
fell
asleep
it
took
me
a
long
time
i
kept
seeing
you
on
the
traverse
he
came
abruptly
to
what
was
on
his
mind
i
have
an
apology
to
make
miss
if
i
made
light
of
your
danger
yesterday
it
was
because
i
was
afraid
you
might
break
down
i
had
to
seem
unsympathetic
rather
than
risk
that
she
smiled
forgiveness
all
you
said
was
that
i
might
have
sprained
my
wrist
it
was
true
too
i
might
have
and
i
did
sheba
showed
a
white
linen
bandage
tied
tightly
around
her
wrist
does
it
pain
much
not
so
much
now
it
throbbed
a
good
deal
last
night
your
whole
weight
came
on
it
with
a
wrench
no
wonder
it
hurt
sheba
noticed
that
the
hannah
was
drawing
up
to
a
wharf
and
the
passengers
were
lining
up
with
their
belongings
is
this
where
we
change
those
of
us
going
to
kusiak
transfer
here
but
there
no
hurry
we
wait
at
this
landing
two
hours
gordon
helped
sheba
move
her
baggage
to
the
other
boat
and
joined
her
on
deck
they
were
both
strangers
in
the
land
their
only
common
acquaintance
was
macdonald
and
he
was
letting
mallory
absorb
his
attention
just
now
left
to
their
own
resources
the
two
young
people
naturally
drifted
together
a
good
deal
this
suited
elliot
he
found
his
companion
wholly
delightful
not
the
less
because
she
was
so
different
from
the
girls
he
knew
at
home
she
could
be
frank
and
even
shyly
audacious
on
occasion
but
she
held
a
little
note
of
reserve
he
felt
bound
to
respect
her
experience
of
the
world
had
clearly
been
limited
she
was
not
at
all
sure
of
herself
of
the
proper
degree
of
intimacy
to
permit
herself
with
a
strange
and
likable
young
man
who
had
done
her
so
signal
a
service
macdonald
left
the
boat
twenty
miles
below
kusiak
with
mallory
and
the
selfridges
a
chauffeur
with
a
was
waiting
on
the
wharf
to
run
them
to
town
but
he
gave
the
wheel
to
macdonald
and
took
the
seat
beside
the
driver
the
little
miner
strong
grinned
across
to
elliot
who
was
standing
beside
miss
at
the
boat
rail
that
mac
all
over
he
hires
a
fellow
to
run
his
car
brings
him
up
here
from
seattle
and
then
takes
the
wheel
himself
every
time
he
rides
i
do
somehow
see
mac
sitting
back
and
letting
another
man
run
the
machine
it
was
close
to
noon
before
the
river
boat
turned
a
bend
and
steamed
up
to
the
wharf
at
kusiak
the
place
was
an
undistinguished
little
log
town
that
rambled
back
from
the
river
up
the
hill
in
a
fashion
its
main
street
ran
a
tortuous
course
parallel
to
the
stream
half
of
the
town
it
seemed
was
down
to
meet
the
boat
are
you
going
to
the
hotel
or
direct
to
your
cousin
gordon
asked
miss
to
my
cousin
i
fancy
she
down
here
to
meet
me
it
was
arranged
that
i
come
on
this
boat
there
was
much
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
back
and
forth
as
the
steamer
slowly
drew
close
to
the
landing
elliot
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
only
people
in
kusiak
he
had
known
before
coming
in
but
though
he
waved
to
them
he
saw
they
did
not
recognize
him
after
the
usual
delay
about
getting
ashore
he
walked
down
the
gangway
carrying
the
suitcases
of
the
irish
girl
sheba
followed
at
his
heels
on
the
wharf
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
slender
young
woman
diane
he
cried
she
stared
at
him
you
what
in
heaven
name
are
you
doing
here
gordon
elliot
she
demanded
and
before
he
could
answer
had
seized
both
hands
and
turned
excitedly
to
call
a
stocky
man
near
peter
peter
guess
who
here
hello
paget
grinned
gordon
and
he
shook
hands
with
the
husband
of
diane
elliot
turned
to
introduce
his
friend
but
she
anticipated
him
cousin
diane
she
said
shyly
do
you
know
me
paget
swooped
down
upon
the
girl
and
smothered
her
in
her
embrace
this
is
sheba
little
sheba
that
i
have
told
you
so
often
about
peter
she
cried
glory
be
i
glad
to
see
you
child
and
diane
kissed
her
again
warmly
you
two
met
on
the
boat
of
course
coming
in
i
hope
you
did
let
her
get
lonesome
gordon
look
after
suitcases
peter
you
come
to
dinner
gordon
at
seven
i
in
the
kind
hands
of
my
countrywoman
laughed
gordon
certainly
be
on
hand
but
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
you
the
last
man
i
have
expected
to
see
i
in
the
service
of
the
government
and
i
been
sent
in
on
business
well
i
going
to
say
something
original
dear
people
paget
replied
it
a
small
world
is
it
while
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
later
in
the
day
elliot
recalled
early
memories
of
the
pagets
he
had
known
diane
ever
since
they
had
been
youngsters
together
at
school
he
remembered
her
as
a
restless
wiry
little
thing
keen
as
a
she
had
developed
into
a
very
pretty
girl
alive
ambitious
energetic
with
a
shrewd
eye
to
the
main
chance
always
popular
socially
she
had
surprised
everybody
by
refusing
the
catch
of
the
town
to
marry
a
young
mining
engineer
without
a
penny
gordon
was
in
college
at
the
time
but
during
the
next
long
vacation
he
had
fraternized
a
good
deal
with
the
peter
pagets
the
young
married
people
had
been
very
much
in
love
with
each
other
but
not
too
preoccupied
to
take
the
college
boy
into
their
happiness
as
a
comrade
diane
always
had
been
a
manager
and
she
liked
playing
older
sister
to
so
nice
a
lad
he
had
been
on
a
footing
friendly
enough
to
drop
in
unannounced
whenever
he
took
the
fancy
if
they
were
out
or
about
to
go
out
the
freedom
of
the
den
a
magazine
and
good
tobacco
had
been
his
then
the
arctic
had
claimed
paget
and
his
bride
that
had
been
more
than
ten
years
ago
and
until
gordon
had
not
seen
them
since
while
elliot
was
brushing
his
dinner
coat
before
the
open
window
of
the
room
assigned
him
at
the
hotel
somebody
came
out
to
the
porch
below
the
voice
of
a
woman
floated
faintly
to
him
seen
diane
irish
beauty
yet
ned
yes
a
man
answered
the
woman
laughed
softly
mallory
came
up
on
the
same
boat
with
her
the
inflection
suggested
that
the
words
were
meant
not
to
tell
a
fact
but
some
less
obvious
inference
oh
you
women
the
man
commented
she
wonderfully
pretty
and
of
course
diane
will
make
the
most
of
her
but
mallory
is
a
woman
among
ten
thousand
i
choose
the
girl
if
it
were
me
said
the
man
but
it
is
you
we
see
what
we
see
they
were
moving
up
the
street
and
gordon
heard
no
more
what
he
had
heard
was
not
clear
to
him
why
should
any
importance
attach
to
the
fact
that
mallory
and
sheba
had
come
up
the
river
on
the
same
boat
yet
he
was
vaguely
disturbed
by
the
insinuation
that
in
some
way
diane
was
entering
her
cousin
as
a
rival
of
the
older
woman
he
resented
the
idea
that
the
fine
young
personality
of
the
irish
girl
was
being
cheapened
by
management
on
the
part
of
diane
paget
elliot
was
not
the
only
dinner
guest
at
the
paget
home
that
evening
he
found
colby
macdonald
sitting
in
the
with
sheba
she
came
quickly
forward
to
meet
the
newly
arrived
guest
macdonald
has
been
telling
me
about
my
father
he
knew
him
on
frenchman
creek
where
they
both
worked
claims
explained
the
girl
the
big
mining
man
made
no
comment
and
added
nothing
to
what
she
said
there
were
times
when
his
face
was
about
as
expressive
as
a
stone
wall
except
for
a
hard
wariness
in
the
eyes
it
told
nothing
now
the
dinner
went
off
very
well
diane
and
peter
had
a
great
many
questions
to
ask
gordon
about
old
friends
by
the
time
these
had
been
answered
macdonald
was
chatting
easily
with
sheba
the
man
had
been
in
many
corners
of
the
world
had
taken
part
in
much
that
was
dramatic
and
interesting
if
the
experience
of
the
irish
girl
had
been
small
her
imagination
had
none
the
less
gone
questing
beyond
the
narrow
bars
of
her
life
upon
amazing
adventure
she
listened
with
glowing
eyes
to
the
strange
tales
this
man
of
magnificent
horizons
had
to
tell
never
before
had
she
come
into
contact
with
any
one
like
him
the
others
too
succumbed
to
his
charm
he
dominated
that
little
because
he
was
a
dynamo
for
all
his
bulk
he
was
as
lean
as
a
panther
and
as
sinewy
there
was
virility
in
the
very
economy
of
his
motions
in
the
reticence
of
his
speech
not
even
a
fool
could
have
read
weakness
there
when
he
followed
sheba
into
the
power
trod
in
his
long
easy
stride
paget
was
superintendent
of
the
lucky
strike
a
mine
owned
principally
by
macdonald
the
two
talked
business
for
a
few
minutes
over
their
cigars
but
diane
interrupted
gayly
to
bring
them
back
into
the
circle
adroitly
she
started
macdonald
on
the
account
of
a
rescue
of
two
men
lost
in
a
blizzard
the
year
before
he
had
the
gift
of
dramatizing
his
story
of
selecting
only
effective
details
there
was
no
suggestion
of
boasting
if
he
happened
to
be
the
hero
of
any
of
his
stories
the
fact
was
of
no
importance
to
him
it
was
merely
a
detail
of
the
picture
he
was
sketching
gordon
interrupted
with
a
question
a
story
he
was
telling
of
a
fight
he
had
seen
between
two
bull
moose
did
you
say
that
was
while
you
were
on
the
way
over
to
inspect
the
kamatlah
for
the
first
time
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
were
quick
with
interest
yes
four
years
ago
last
spring
macdonald
looked
at
him
with
a
wary
steadiness
some
doubt
had
found
lodgment
in
his
mind
before
he
could
voice
it
if
indeed
he
had
any
such
intention
elliot
broke
in
swiftly
do
answer
that
question
i
asked
it
without
proper
thought
i
am
a
special
agent
of
the
general
land
office
sent
up
to
investigate
the
macdonald
coal
claims
and
kindred
interests
slowly
the
rigor
of
the
big
scotchman
steely
eyes
relaxed
to
a
smile
that
was
genial
and
disarming
if
this
news
hit
him
hard
he
gave
no
sign
of
it
and
that
it
was
an
unexpected
blow
there
could
be
no
doubt
glad
you
come
elliot
we
ask
nothing
but
fair
play
tell
the
truth
and
we
thank
you
the
men
who
own
the
macdonald
group
of
claims
have
nothing
to
conceal
i
answer
that
question
i
meant
to
say
two
years
ago
last
spring
his
voice
was
easy
and
his
gaze
unwavering
as
he
made
the
correction
yet
everybody
in
the
room
except
sheba
knew
he
was
deliberately
lying
to
cover
the
slip
for
the
admission
that
he
had
inspected
the
kamatlah
field
just
before
his
dummies
had
filed
upon
it
would
at
least
tend
to
aggravate
suspicion
that
the
entries
were
not
it
was
rather
an
awkward
moment
diane
blamed
herself
because
she
had
brought
the
men
together
socially
why
had
she
not
asked
gordon
more
explicitly
what
his
business
was
peter
grinned
a
little
uncomfortably
it
was
sheba
who
quite
unconsciously
relieved
the
situation
but
what
about
the
big
moose
macdonald
what
did
it
do
then
the
alaskan
went
back
to
his
story
he
was
talking
for
sheba
alone
for
the
young
girl
with
eager
fascinated
eyes
which
flashed
with
sympathy
as
they
devoured
selected
glimpses
of
his
wild
turbulent
career
her
clean
brave
spirit
was
throwing
a
glamour
over
the
man
she
saw
him
with
other
eyes
than
elliot
the
government
official
admired
him
tremendously
macdonald
was
an
he
blazed
trails
for
others
to
follow
in
safety
but
gordon
could
guess
how
callously
his
path
was
strewn
with
brutality
with
the
effects
of
an
ethical
largely
selfish
though
even
he
did
not
know
that
the
man
primitive
jungle
code
of
wolf
eat
wolf
had
played
havoc
with
sheba
young
life
many
years
before
diane
satisfied
that
macdonald
had
scored
called
upon
sheba
i
want
you
to
sing
for
us
dear
if
you
will
sheba
accompanied
herself
the
voice
of
the
girl
had
no
unusual
range
but
it
was
singularly
sweet
and
full
of
the
poignant
feeling
that
expresses
the
haunting
pathos
of
her
race
it
well
i
know
ye
shevè
cross
ye
weary
stony
hill
an
i
tired
och
i
tired
to
be
looking
on
ye
still
for
here
i
live
the
near
side
an
he
is
on
the
far
an
all
your
heights
and
hollows
are
between
us
so
they
are
och
anee
gordon
as
he
listened
felt
the
strange
hunger
of
that
homesick
cry
steal
through
his
blood
he
saw
his
own
emotions
reflected
in
the
face
of
the
who
was
watching
with
a
tense
interest
the
slim
young
figure
at
the
piano
the
girl
whose
eyes
were
soft
and
dewy
with
the
mysticism
of
her
people
were
still
luminous
with
the
poetry
of
the
child
in
spite
of
the
years
that
heralded
her
a
woman
elliot
intercepted
the
triumphant
sweep
of
diane
glance
from
macdonald
to
her
husband
in
a
flash
it
lit
up
for
him
the
words
he
had
heard
on
the
hotel
porch
diane
an
inveterate
matchmaker
intended
her
cousin
to
marry
colby
macdonald
no
doubt
she
thought
she
was
doing
a
fine
thing
for
the
girl
he
was
a
millionaire
the
biggest
figure
in
the
northwest
his
iron
will
ran
the
town
and
district
as
though
the
people
were
chattels
of
his
back
of
him
were
some
of
the
biggest
financial
interests
in
the
united
states
but
the
gorge
of
elliot
rose
the
man
after
all
was
a
a
menace
to
civilization
he
was
a
survivor
by
reason
of
his
strength
from
the
primitive
already
the
special
agent
had
heard
many
strange
stories
of
how
this
man
of
steel
had
risen
to
supremacy
by
trampling
down
lesser
men
with
whom
he
had
had
dealings
of
terrible
battles
from
which
his
lean
powerful
body
had
emerged
bloody
and
battered
but
victorious
the
very
look
of
his
hard
gray
eyes
was
dominant
and
masterful
he
would
win
no
matter
how
it
came
to
rebel
heart
that
if
macdonald
wanted
this
lovely
irish
girl
and
the
young
man
never
doubted
that
the
scotchman
would
want
her
he
would
reach
out
and
gather
in
sheba
just
as
if
she
were
a
coal
mine
or
a
placer
prospect
all
this
surged
through
the
mind
of
the
young
man
while
the
singer
was
on
the
first
line
of
the
second
stanza
but
if
was
only
shevè
cross
to
climb
from
foot
to
crown
i
soon
be
up
an
over
that
i
soon
be
runnin
down
then
sure
the
great
ould
sea
itself
is
there
beyont
the
bar
an
all
the
windy
wathers
are
between
us
so
they
are
och
anee
the
rich
soft
young
voice
with
its
irish
brogue
died
away
the
little
audience
paid
the
singer
the
tribute
of
silence
she
herself
was
the
first
to
speak
is
the
name
of
it
a
namesake
of
mine
moira
wrote
it
she
explained
it
a
beautiful
song
and
i
thank
ye
for
singing
it
macdonald
said
simply
it
minds
me
of
my
own
barefoot
days
by
the
tay
later
in
the
evening
the
two
dinner
guests
walked
back
to
the
hotel
together
the
two
subjects
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
both
were
not
mentioned
by
either
they
discussed
casually
the
cost
of
living
in
the
north
the
raising
of
strawberries
at
kusiak
and
the
best
way
to
treat
the
mosquito
nuisance
but
neither
of
them
referred
to
the
macdonald
coal
claims
or
to
sheba
chapter
vii
wally
gets
orders
macdonald
from
his
desk
looked
up
at
the
man
in
the
doorway
selfridge
had
come
in
jauntily
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
but
at
sight
of
the
grim
face
of
his
chief
the
grin
fled
come
in
and
shut
the
door
ordered
the
scotchman
i
sent
for
you
to
congratulate
you
wally
you
did
fine
work
outside
you
told
me
you
that
it
was
all
settled
at
last
that
our
claims
are
for
patent
the
tubby
little
man
felt
the
edge
of
irony
in
the
quiet
voice
sure
that
what
winton
told
me
he
assented
nervously
then
you
be
interested
to
know
that
a
special
field
agent
of
the
land
department
sat
opposite
me
last
night
and
without
batting
an
eye
came
across
with
the
glad
news
that
he
was
here
to
investigate
our
claims
selfridge
bounced
up
like
a
rubber
ball
from
the
chair
into
which
he
had
just
settled
what
pleasant
surprise
is
it
i
been
wondering
what
you
were
doing
outside
of
course
i
know
you
had
to
take
in
the
shows
and
cabarets
of
new
york
but
could
you
edge
in
an
hour
or
two
once
a
week
to
attend
to
business
wally
collar
began
to
choke
him
the
cool
hard
words
of
the
big
scotchman
pelted
like
hail
must
be
a
bluff
mac
the
muckrake
magazines
have
raised
such
a
row
about
the
guttenchild
crowd
putting
over
a
big
steal
on
the
public
that
the
party
leaders
are
scared
stiff
i
could
pick
up
a
newspaper
anywhere
without
seeing
your
name
in
the
headlines
it
was
fierce
selfridge
had
found
his
glib
tongue
and
was
off
i
understand
that
wally
what
i
do
get
is
how
you
came
to
let
them
slip
this
over
on
you
without
even
a
guess
that
it
was
going
to
happen
that
phase
of
the
subject
selfridge
did
not
want
to
discuss
bet
you
a
hat
i
guessed
it
right
just
a
play
of
the
administration
to
fool
the
dear
people
this
fellow
has
got
his
orders
to
give
us
a
clean
bill
of
health
sure
that
must
be
it
i
suppose
this
man
elliot
that
came
up
on
the
boat
with
us
yes
well
that
easy
if
he
has
been
seen
we
can
see
him
macdonald
looked
his
man
friday
over
with
a
scarcely
veiled
contempt
you
have
a
beautiful
childlike
faith
in
every
man
dishonesty
wally
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
some
people
are
straight
that
they
sell
out
all
he
gets
is
a
beggarly
two
thousand
or
so
a
year
we
can
fix
him
all
right
you
about
as
much
vision
as
a
breed
trader
unless
i
miss
my
guess
elliot
is
that
kind
he
go
through
to
a
finish
what
i
like
to
know
is
how
his
mind
works
if
he
sees
straight
we
all
right
but
if
he
is
a
narrow
conservation
fanatic
he
might
go
ahead
and
queer
the
whole
game
you
would
stand
for
that
the
quick
glance
of
selfridge
asked
a
question
the
lips
of
the
scotchman
were
like
steel
traps
and
his
eyes
points
of
steel
we
cross
that
bridge
if
we
come
to
it
our
first
move
is
to
try
to
win
him
to
see
this
thing
our
way
i
have
a
casual
talk
with
him
before
he
leaves
for
kamatlah
and
feel
him
out
what
he
doing
here
at
all
if
he
investigating
the
kamatlah
claims
why
does
he
go
hundreds
of
miles
out
of
his
way
to
come
in
to
kusiak
asked
selfridge
macdonald
smiled
sardonically
he
doing
this
job
right
elliot
as
good
as
told
me
that
he
on
the
job
to
look
up
my
record
thoroughly
so
he
comes
to
kusiak
first
in
a
few
days
he
leave
for
kamatlah
where
you
come
in
wally
how
do
you
mean
you
going
to
start
for
kamatlah
you
arrange
the
stage
before
he
gets
there
see
all
the
men
and
the
foremen
line
them
up
so
they
come
through
with
the
proper
talk
if
you
have
any
doubts
about
whether
you
can
trust
some
one
do
take
any
chances
fire
him
out
of
the
camp
offer
elliot
the
company
hospitality
load
him
down
with
favors
take
him
everywhere
show
him
everything
but
do
let
him
get
any
proofs
that
the
claims
are
being
worked
under
the
same
management
but
he
suspect
it
you
ca
help
his
suspicions
do
let
him
get
proof
cover
all
the
tracks
that
show
company
control
i
can
fix
that
he
said
but
what
about
holt
the
old
man
wo
do
a
thing
but
tell
all
he
knows
and
a
lot
more
that
he
suspects
you
know
how
bitter
he
is
and
crazy
he
ought
to
be
locked
away
with
the
you
must
let
elliot
meet
holt
how
the
deuce
can
i
help
it
no
chance
to
keep
them
apart
in
that
little
hole
it
ca
be
done
ca
it
something
in
the
quiet
voice
rang
a
bell
of
alarm
in
the
timid
heart
of
selfridge
you
mean
a
man
who
works
for
me
as
my
lieutenant
must
have
nerve
wally
have
you
got
it
will
you
take
orders
and
go
through
with
them
his
hard
eyes
searched
the
face
of
the
plump
little
man
this
was
a
job
he
would
have
liked
to
do
himself
but
he
could
not
get
away
just
now
selfridge
was
the
only
man
about
him
he
could
trust
with
it
wally
nodded
his
lips
were
dry
and
parched
go
to
it
what
am
i
to
do
get
holt
out
of
the
way
while
elliot
is
at
kamatlah
but
good
lord
i
ca
keep
the
man
tied
up
a
month
protested
the
leading
tenor
of
kusiak
it
is
doing
holt
any
good
to
sit
tight
clamped
to
that
claim
of
his
he
needs
a
change
besides
i
want
him
away
so
that
we
can
contest
his
claim
run
him
up
into
the
hills
or
send
him
across
to
siberia
on
a
whaler
or
better
still
have
him
arrested
for
insanity
and
send
him
to
nome
i
get
judge
landor
to
hold
him
a
while
that
would
give
him
an
alibi
for
his
absence
and
prevent
a
contest
that
right
it
would
leave
it
to
me
the
old
man
is
going
on
a
vacation
though
he
know
it
yet
good
enough
wally
i
trust
you
but
remember
this
fight
has
reached
an
acute
stage
no
more
mistakes
the
devil
of
it
is
we
never
seem
to
land
the
knockout
punch
we
beaten
this
bunch
of
reform
idiots
before
winton
before
the
secretary
of
the
interior
before
the
president
and
before
congress
now
they
beginning
all
over
again
where
is
it
to
end
this
is
their
last
kick
probably
guttenchild
agreed
to
it
so
as
to
let
the
party
go
before
the
people
at
the
next
election
without
any
apologies
entirely
formal
investigation
i
should
say
this
might
be
true
or
it
might
not
macdonald
knew
that
just
now
the
american
people
always
impulsive
in
its
thinking
was
supporting
strongly
the
movement
for
conservation
a
searchlight
had
been
turned
upon
the
kamatlah
magazines
and
newspapers
had
hammered
it
home
to
readers
that
the
guttenchild
and
allied
interests
were
engaged
in
a
big
steal
from
the
people
of
coal
timber
and
lands
to
the
value
of
more
than
a
hundred
million
dollars
the
trouble
had
originated
in
a
department
row
but
it
had
spread
until
the
macdonald
claims
had
become
a
party
issue
the
officials
of
the
land
office
as
well
as
the
national
administration
were
friendly
to
the
claimants
they
had
no
desire
to
offend
one
of
the
two
largest
money
groups
in
the
country
but
neither
did
they
want
to
come
to
wreck
on
account
of
the
guttenchilds
they
found
it
impossible
to
ignore
the
charge
that
the
entries
were
fraudulent
and
if
consummated
would
result
in
a
wholesale
robbery
of
the
public
domain
superficial
investigations
had
been
made
and
the
claimants
whitewashed
but
the
clamor
had
persisted
though
he
denied
it
officially
macdonald
made
a
present
to
the
public
of
the
admission
that
the
entries
were
irregular
laws
he
held
were
made
for
men
and
should
be
interpreted
to
aid
progress
bad
ones
ought
to
be
evaded
the
facts
were
simple
enough
macdonald
was
the
original
promoter
of
the
kamatlah
he
had
engaged
dummy
entrymen
to
take
up
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
each
under
the
homestead
act
later
he
intended
to
consolidate
the
claims
and
turn
them
over
to
the
guttenchilds
under
an
agreement
by
which
he
was
to
receive
one
eighth
of
the
stock
of
the
company
formed
to
work
the
mines
the
entries
had
been
made
the
fee
accepted
by
the
land
office
and
receipts
issued
in
course
of
time
macdonald
had
applied
for
patents
before
these
were
issued
the
magazines
began
to
pour
in
their
broadsides
and
since
then
the
papers
had
been
held
up
the
conscience
of
macdonald
was
quite
clear
the
pioneers
in
alaska
were
building
out
of
the
arctic
waste
a
new
empire
for
the
united
states
and
he
held
that
a
fair
government
could
do
no
less
than
offer
them
liberal
treatment
to
lock
up
from
present
use
vast
resources
needed
by
alaskans
would
be
a
mistaken
policy
a
narrow
and
perverted
application
of
the
doctrine
of
conservation
the
territory
should
be
thrown
open
to
the
world
if
capital
were
invited
in
to
do
its
share
of
the
building
immigration
would
flow
rapidly
northward
within
the
lives
of
the
present
generation
the
new
empire
would
take
shape
and
wealth
would
pour
inevitably
into
the
united
states
from
its
frozen
treasure
house
the
view
held
by
macdonald
was
one
common
to
the
whole
pacific
coast
seattle
portland
san
francisco
were
a
unit
in
the
belief
that
the
government
had
no
right
to
close
the
door
of
alaska
and
then
put
a
padlock
upon
it
feminine
voices
drifted
from
the
outer
office
macdonald
opened
the
door
to
let
in
selfridge
and
mallory
the
latter
lady
and
gloved
shook
hands
smilingly
with
the
of
course
we
intruders
in
business
hours
though
you
tell
us
we
not
she
suggested
he
was
not
a
man
to
surrender
easily
to
the
spell
of
woman
but
when
he
looked
into
her
smouldering
eyes
something
sultry
beat
in
his
blood
business
may
fly
out
of
the
window
when
mallory
comes
in
at
the
door
he
answered
how
gallant
of
you
especially
when
i
come
with
an
impertinent
question
her
gay
eyes
mocked
him
as
she
spoke
then
i
probably
tell
you
to
mind
your
own
business
he
laughed
let
have
your
question
i
just
been
reading
the
magazine
a
writer
there
says
that
you
are
a
highway
robber
and
a
gambler
i
know
you
a
robber
because
all
the
magazines
say
so
but
are
you
only
a
big
gambler
he
met
her
raillery
without
the
least
embarrassment
sure
i
gamble
every
time
i
take
a
chance
i
gambling
so
does
everybody
else
when
you
walk
past
the
flatiron
building
you
bet
it
wo
fall
down
and
crush
you
we
got
to
take
chances
to
live
how
true
and
i
never
thought
of
it
beamed
selfridge
what
a
philosopher
you
are
mr
macdonald
the
scotchman
went
on
without
paying
any
attention
to
her
effervescence
i
gambled
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
i
bet
i
could
cross
death
valley
and
get
out
alive
that
time
i
won
i
bet
it
would
rain
once
down
in
arizona
before
my
cattle
died
i
lost
another
time
i
took
a
contract
to
run
a
tunnel
in
my
bid
i
bet
i
would
run
into
rock
my
bank
went
broke
that
trip
when
i
joined
the
klondike
rush
i
was
backing
my
luck
to
stand
up
same
thing
when
i
located
the
kamatlah
field
the
coal
might
be
a
poor
quality
maybe
i
could
interest
big
capital
in
the
proposition
perhaps
the
government
would
turn
me
down
when
i
came
to
prove
up
i
was
betting
my
last
dollar
against
big
odds
when
i
quit
gambling
it
will
be
because
i
quit
living
and
i
suppose
i
a
gambler
too
mallory
demanded
with
a
little
tilt
of
her
handsome
head
he
looked
straight
at
her
with
the
keen
eyes
that
had
bored
through
her
from
the
first
day
they
had
met
the
eyes
that
understood
the
manner
of
woman
she
was
and
liked
her
none
the
less
of
all
the
women
i
know
you
are
the
best
gambler
it
born
in
you
why
mr
macdonald
screamed
selfridge
in
her
high
staccato
i
do
think
that
a
compliment
mallory
did
not
often
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
a
blush
but
she
changed
color
now
this
big
blunt
man
sometimes
had
an
uncanny
divination
did
he
she
asked
herself
know
what
stake
she
was
gambling
for
at
kusiak
you
are
too
wise
she
laughed
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
very
becoming
but
i
suppose
you
are
right
i
like
excitement
we
all
do
the
only
man
who
does
gamble
is
the
convict
in
stripes
and
the
only
reason
he
does
is
that
his
chips
are
all
gone
it
true
that
men
on
the
frontier
play
for
bigger
stakes
they
back
their
bets
with
all
they
have
got
and
put
their
lives
on
top
for
good
measure
but
kids
in
the
cradle
all
over
the
united
states
are
going
to
live
easier
because
of
the
gamblers
at
the
places
that
writer
fellow
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
about
me
my
whole
life
is
a
gamble
she
moved
with
slow
grace
toward
the
door
then
over
her
shoulder
flashed
a
sudden
invitation
at
him
selfridge
and
i
are
doing
a
little
betting
big
chief
gambler
we
backing
our
luck
that
you
two
men
will
eat
lunch
with
us

chapter
viii
the
end
of
the
passage
wally
selfridge
was
a
reliable
business
subordinate
even
though
he
had
slipped
up
in
the
matter
of
the
appointment
of
elliot
but
when
it
came
to
facing
the
physical
hardships
of
the
north
he
was
a
malingerer
the
kamatlah
trip
had
to
be
taken
because
his
chief
had
ordered
it
but
the
little
man
shirked
the
journey
in
his
heart
just
as
he
knew
his
soft
muscles
would
shrink
from
the
aches
of
the
trail
his
idea
of
work
was
a
set
of
tennis
on
the
outdoor
wooden
court
of
the
kusiak
clubhouse
and
even
there
his
game
was
not
a
hard
smashing
one
but
an
easy
foursome
with
a
girl
for
partner
he
liked
better
to
play
bridge
with
attendants
at
hand
to
supply
drinks
and
cigars
by
nature
he
was
a
sybarite
the
call
of
the
frontier
found
no
response
in
his
sophisticated
soul
the
part
of
the
journey
to
be
made
by
water
was
not
so
bad
left
to
his
own
judgment
he
would
have
gone
to
michael
by
boat
and
chartered
a
small
steamer
for
the
long
trip
along
the
coast
through
bering
sea
but
this
would
take
time
and
macdonald
did
not
mean
to
let
him
waste
a
day
he
was
to
leave
the
river
boat
at
the
big
bend
and
pack
across
country
to
kamatlah
it
would
be
a
rough
heavy
trail
the
mosquitoes
would
be
a
continual
torment
the
cooking
would
be
poor
and
at
the
end
of
the
long
trek
there
awaited
him
monotonous
months
in
a
wretched
coal
camp
far
from
all
the
comforts
of
civilization
no
wonder
he
grumbled
but
though
he
grumbled
at
home
and
at
the
club
and
on
the
street
about
his
coming
exile
selfridge
made
no
complaints
to
macdonald
that
man
of
steel
had
no
sympathy
with
the
yearnings
for
the
fleshpots
he
was
used
to
driving
himself
through
discomfort
to
his
end
and
he
expected
as
much
of
his
deputies
wherefore
wally
took
the
boat
at
the
time
scheduled
and
waved
a
dismal
farewell
to
wife
and
friends
assembled
upon
the
wharf
elliot
said
to
the
pagets
and
miss
ten
days
later
diane
was
very
frank
with
him
i
hear
you
been
sleuthing
around
gordon
for
facts
about
colby
macdonald
i
do
know
what
you
have
heard
about
him
but
i
hope
got
the
sense
to
see
how
big
a
man
he
is
and
how
much
this
country
here
owes
him
gordon
nodded
agreement
yes
he
a
big
man
and
he
good
added
sheba
eagerly
he
never
talks
of
it
but
one
finds
out
splendid
things
he
has
done
the
young
man
smiled
but
not
at
all
superciliously
he
liked
the
stanch
faith
of
the
girl
in
her
friend
even
though
his
investigations
had
not
led
him
to
accept
goodness
as
the
outstanding
quality
of
the
scotchman
i
do
know
what
we
would
do
without
him
diane
went
on
give
him
ten
years
and
a
free
hand
and
alaska
will
be
fit
for
white
people
to
live
in
these
attacks
on
him
by
newspapers
and
magazines
are
an
outrage
it
plain
that
you
are
a
partisan
charged
gordon
gayly
i
against
locking
up
alaska
and
throwing
away
the
key
if
that
is
what
you
mean
by
a
partisan
we
need
this
country
opened
up
the
farms
settled
the
mines
worked
the
developed
railroads
built
it
is
one
great
big
opportunity
the
country
here
and
the
narrow
little
conservation
cranks
want
to
shut
it
up
tight
from
the
people
who
have
energy
and
foresight
enough
to
help
do
the
building
the
kusiak
chamber
of
commerce
ought
to
send
you
out
as
a
lecturer
to
change
public
opinion
diane
you
are
one
enthusiastic
little
booster
for
freedom
of
opportunity
laughed
the
young
man
oh
well
diane
joined
in
his
laughter
it
was
one
of
her
good
points
that
she
could
laugh
at
herself
i
dare
say
i
do
sound
like
a
real
estate
pamphlet
but
it
all
true
anyhow
gordon
left
kusiak
as
reluctantly
as
wally
selfridge
had
done
though
his
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
go
were
quite
different
they
centered
about
a
young
woman
whom
he
had
seen
for
the
first
time
a
fortnight
before
he
would
have
denied
even
to
himself
that
he
was
in
love
but
whenever
he
was
alone
his
thoughts
reverted
to
sheba
at
the
big
bend
gordon
left
the
river
boat
for
his
trek
near
the
roadhouse
was
an
indian
village
where
he
had
expected
to
get
a
guide
for
the
journey
to
kamatlah
but
the
fishing
season
had
begun
and
the
men
had
all
gone
down
river
to
take
part
in
it
the
old
frenchman
who
kept
the
and
roadhouse
advised
gordon
not
to
attempt
the
tramp
alone
the
trail
it
ees
what
you
call
dangerous
swamp
ees
a
monster
that
swallows
men
alive
monsieur
you
wait
one
week
two
week
week
and
some
one
will
turn
up
to
take
you
through
he
urged
but
i
ca
wait
and
i
have
an
official
map
of
the
trail
why
i
follow
it
without
a
guide
elliot
wanted
to
know
impatiently
the
shrugged
maybeso
monsieur
maybe
not
it
ees
one
devil
of
a
trail
no
chechakoes
are
safe
in
there
without
a
guide
i
baptiste
know
selfridge
and
his
party
went
through
a
week
ago
i
can
follow
the
tracks
they
left
but
if
it
rains
monsieur
the
tracks
will
vaneesh
ce
pas
lose
the
way
and
the
little
singing
folk
will
swarm
in
clouds
about
monsieur
while
he
stumbles
through
the
swamp
elliot
hesitated
for
the
better
part
of
a
day
then
came
to
an
impulsive
decision
he
knew
the
evil
fame
of
swamp
that
no
trail
in
alaska
was
held
to
be
more
difficult
or
dangerous
he
knew
too
what
a
fearful
pest
the
mosquitoes
were
peter
had
told
him
a
story
of
how
he
and
a
party
of
engineers
had
come
upon
a
man
wandering
in
the
hills
driven
mad
by
mosquitoes
the
traveler
had
lost
his
matches
and
had
been
unable
to
light
smudge
fires
day
and
night
the
little
singing
devils
had
swarmed
about
him
he
could
not
sleep
he
could
not
rest
every
moment
for
hours
he
had
fought
for
his
life
against
them
within
an
hour
of
the
time
they
found
him
the
man
had
died
a
raving
maniac
but
elliot
was
well
equipped
with
mosquito
netting
and
with
supplies
he
had
a
reliable
map
and
anyhow
he
had
only
to
follow
the
tracks
left
by
the
selfridge
party
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
big
river
and
plunged
into
the
wilderness
there
came
a
night
when
he
looked
up
into
the
stars
of
the
deep
still
sky
and
knew
that
he
was
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
other
human
being
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
much
alone
he
was
not
afraid
but
there
was
something
awesome
in
a
world
so
empty
of
his
kind
sometimes
he
sang
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
at
first
startled
him
it
was
like
living
in
a
world
primeval
this
traverse
of
a
land
so
void
of
all
the
mechanism
that
man
has
built
about
him
the
tracks
of
the
selfridge
party
grew
fainter
after
a
night
of
rain
more
rain
fell
and
they
were
obliterated
altogether
gordon
fished
he
killed
fresh
game
for
his
needs
often
he
came
on
the
tracks
of
moose
and
caribou
sometimes
startled
they
leaped
into
view
quite
close
enough
for
a
shot
but
he
used
his
rifle
only
to
meet
his
wants
a
huge
grizzly
faced
him
on
the
trail
one
afternoon
growled
its
menace
and
went
lumbering
into
the
big
rocks
with
awkward
speed
the
way
led
through
valley
and
morass
across
hills
and
mountains
it
wandered
in
a
sort
of
haphazard
fashion
through
a
universe
washed
clean
of
sordidness
and
meanness
always
as
he
pushed
forward
the
path
grew
more
faint
and
uncertain
elk
runs
crossed
it
here
and
there
so
that
often
gordon
went
astray
and
had
to
retrace
his
steps
the
maddening
song
of
the
mosquitoes
was
always
with
him
only
when
he
slept
did
he
escape
from
it
the
heavy
gloves
the
netting
the
smudge
fires
were
at
best
an
insufficient
protection
it
was
the
seventh
night
out
that
elliot
suspected
he
was
off
the
trail
rain
sluiced
down
in
torrents
and
next
day
continued
to
pour
from
a
dun
sky
his
own
tracks
were
blotted
out
and
he
searched
for
the
trail
in
vain
before
the
rain
stopped
he
was
thoroughly
disturbed
in
mind
it
would
be
a
serious
business
if
he
should
be
lost
in
the
bad
lands
of
the
bogs
even
though
he
knew
the
general
direction
he
must
follow
there
was
no
certainty
that
he
would
ever
emerge
from
this
swamp
into
which
he
had
plunged
before
he
knew
it
he
was
entangled
in
his
map
showed
him
the
morass
stretched
for
fifty
miles
to
the
south
but
he
knew
that
it
had
been
charted
hurriedly
by
a
surveying
party
which
had
made
no
extensive
explorations
a
good
deal
of
this
country
was
it
ran
vaguely
into
a
no
man
land
unknown
to
the
prospector
the
going
was
heavy
gordon
had
to
pick
his
way
through
the
mossy
swamp
leading
the
by
the
bridle
sometimes
he
was
in
water
of
a
greenish
slime
again
he
had
to
drag
the
animal
from
the
bog
to
a
hummock
of
grass
which
gave
a
spongy
footing
this
would
end
in
another
quagmire
of
peat
through
which
they
must
plough
with
the
mud
sucking
at
their
feet
it
was
hard
wearing
toil
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
keep
moving
the
young
man
staggered
forward
till
dusk
utterly
exhausted
he
camped
for
the
night
on
a
hillock
of
moss
that
rose
like
an
island
in
the
swamp
after
he
had
eaten
he
fed
his
fire
with
green
boughs
that
raised
a
dense
smoke
he
lay
on
the
leeward
side
where
the
smoke
drifted
over
him
and
fought
mosquitoes
till
a
shift
of
the
wind
lessened
the
plague
toward
midnight
he
rigged
up
a
net
for
protection
and
crawled
into
his
blankets
instantly
he
fell
sound
asleep
elliot
traveled
next
day
by
the
compass
he
had
food
for
three
days
more
but
he
knew
that
no
living
man
had
the
strength
to
travel
for
so
long
in
such
a
morass
it
was
near
midday
when
he
lost
his
horse
the
animal
had
bogged
down
several
times
and
gordon
had
wasted
much
time
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
needed
energy
in
dragging
it
to
firmer
footing
this
time
the
pony
refused
to
answer
the
whip
its
master
unloaded
pack
and
saddle
he
tried
coaxing
he
tried
the
whip
come
one
plunge
and
you
make
it
yet
he
urged
the
turned
upon
him
dumb
eyes
of
reproach
struggled
to
free
its
limbs
from
the
mud
and
sank
down
helplessly
it
had
traveled
its
last
yard
on
the
long
alaska
trails
after
the
sound
of
the
shot
had
died
away
gordon
struggled
with
the
pack
to
the
nearest
hummock
he
cut
holes
in
a
to
fit
his
shoulders
and
packed
into
it
his
blankets
a
saucepan
the
beans
the
coffee
and
the
diminished
handful
of
flour
into
it
went
too
the
three
slices
of
bacon
that
were
left
he
hoisted
the
pack
to
his
back
and
slipped
his
arms
through
the
slits
he
had
made
painfully
he
labored
forward
over
the
quivering
peat
every
weary
muscle
revolted
at
the
demands
his
will
imposed
upon
it
he
drew
on
the
last
ounce
of
his
strength
and
staggered
forward
sometimes
he
stumbled
and
went
down
into
the
oozing
mud
minded
to
stay
there
and
be
done
with
the
struggle
but
the
urge
of
life
drove
him
to
his
feet
again
it
sent
him
pitching
forward
drunkenly
it
carried
him
for
weary
miles
after
he
despaired
of
ever
covering
another
hundred
yards
with
old
signals
from
the
football
field
he
spurred
his
will
perhaps
his
mind
was
already
beginning
to
wander
though
through
it
all
he
held
steadily
to
the
direction
that
alone
could
save
him
he
clapped
his
hands
feebly
and
stooped
for
the
plunge
at
the
line
of
the
enemy
gord
nine
eleven
seventeen
hit
low
you
elliot
when
at
last
he
went
down
to
stay
it
was
in
an
exhaustion
so
complete
that
not
even
his
indomitable
will
could
lash
him
to
his
feet
again
for
an
hour
he
lay
in
a
stupor
never
stirring
even
to
fight
the
swarm
of
mosquitoes
that
buzzed
about
him
toward
evening
he
sat
up
and
undid
the
pack
from
his
back
the
matches
in
a
tin
box
wrapped
carefully
with
oilskin
were
still
perfectly
dry
soon
he
had
a
fire
going
and
coffee
boiling
in
the
from
the
tin
cup
he
carried
strung
on
his
belt
he
drank
the
coffee
it
went
through
him
like
strong
liquor
he
warmed
some
beans
and
fried
himself
a
slice
of
bacon
sopping
up
the
grease
with
a
cold
biscuit
left
over
from
the
day
before
again
he
slept
for
a
few
hours
he
had
wound
his
watch
mechanically
and
it
showed
him
four
when
he
took
up
the
trail
once
more
in
seattle
and
san
francisco
people
were
still
asleep
and
darkness
was
heavy
over
the
land
here
it
had
been
day
for
a
long
time
ever
since
the
summer
sun
hidden
for
a
while
behind
the
low
distant
hills
had
come
blazing
forth
again
in
a
saddle
between
two
peaks
gordon
had
reduced
his
pack
by
discarding
a
blanket
the
and
all
the
clothing
he
was
not
wearing
his
rifle
lay
behind
him
in
the
swamp
he
had
cut
to
a
minimum
of
safety
what
he
was
carrying
according
to
his
judgment
but
before
long
his
last
blanket
was
flung
aside
he
could
not
afford
to
carry
an
extra
pound
for
he
knew
he
was
running
a
race
the
stakes
of
which
were
life
and
death
a
cloud
of
mosquitoes
moved
with
him
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
spruce
bough
for
defense
against
them
his
hands
were
gloved
his
face
was
covered
with
netting
but
in
spite
of
the
best
he
could
do
they
were
an
added
torture
afternoon
found
him
still
staggering
forward
the
swamps
were
now
behind
him
he
had
won
through
at
last
by
the
narrowest
margin
possible
the
ground
was
rising
sharply
toward
the
mountains
across
the
range
somewhere
lay
kamatlah
but
he
was
all
in
with
his
food
almost
gone
a
water
supply
uncertain
reserve
strength
exhausted
the
chances
of
getting
over
the
divide
to
safety
were
practically
none
he
had
come
so
far
as
he
could
see
to
the
end
of
the
passage
chapter
ix
gid
holt
goes
prospecting
as
soon
as
selfridge
reached
kamatlah
he
began
arranging
the
stage
against
the
arrival
of
the
government
agent
his
preparations
were
elaborate
and
thorough
a
young
engineer
named
howland
had
been
in
charge
of
the
development
work
but
wally
rearranged
his
forces
so
as
to
let
each
dummy
entryman
handle
the
claim
entered
in
his
name
one
or
two
men
about
whom
he
was
doubtful
he
discharged
and
hurried
out
of
the
camp
selfridge
had
been
given
a
free
hand
as
to
expenses
and
he
oiled
his
way
by
liberal
treatment
of
the
men
and
by
a
judicious
expenditure
he
let
them
know
pretty
plainly
that
if
the
agent
on
his
way
to
kamatlah
suspected
corporate
ownership
of
the
claims
the
government
would
close
down
all
work
and
there
would
be
no
jobs
for
them
the
company
became
a
restaurant
above
which
was
suspended
a
newly
painted
sign
with
the
legend
san
francisco
grill
glynn
proprietor
the
store
also
passed
temporarily
into
the
hands
of
its
manager
miners
moved
from
the
barracks
that
had
been
built
by
macdonald
into
hastily
constructed
cabins
on
the
individual
claims
wally
had
always
fancied
himself
as
a
stage
manager
for
amateur
theatricals
now
he
justified
his
faith
by
transforming
kamatlah
outwardly
from
a
company
camp
to
a
mushroom
one
settled
by
wandering
prospectors
gideon
holt
alone
was
outside
of
all
these
activities
and
watched
them
with
suspicion
he
was
an
sly
but
fearless
who
hated
colby
macdonald
with
a
bitter
jealousy
that
could
not
be
placated
and
he
took
no
pains
to
hide
the
fact
he
had
happened
to
be
in
the
vicinity
prospecting
when
macdonald
had
rushed
his
entries
partly
out
of
mere
perversity
and
partly
by
reason
of
native
shrewdness
old
holt
had
slipped
in
and
located
one
of
the
best
claims
in
the
heart
of
the
group
nor
had
he
been
moved
to
a
reasonable
compromise
by
any
amount
of
persuasion
threats
or
tentative
offers
to
buy
a
relinquishment
he
was
obstinate
he
knew
a
good
thing
when
he
had
it
and
he
meant
to
sit
tight
the
adherents
of
the
company
might
charge
that
holt
was
cracked
in
the
upper
story
but
none
of
them
denied
he
was
sharp
as
a
street
arab
he
guessed
that
all
this
preparation
was
not
for
nothing
kamatlah
was
being
dressed
up
to
impress
somebody
who
would
shortly
arrive
the
first
thought
of
holt
was
that
a
group
of
big
capitalists
might
be
coming
to
look
over
their
investment
but
he
rejected
this
surmise
there
would
be
no
need
to
try
any
deception
upon
them
mail
from
seattle
reached
camp
once
a
month
holt
sat
down
before
his
stove
to
read
one
of
the
newspapers
he
had
brought
from
the
office
it
was
the
on
the
fifth
page
was
a
little
boxed
story
that
gave
him
his
clue
elliot
to
investigate
macdonald
coal
claims
the
reopening
of
the
controversy
as
to
the
macdonald
claims
which
had
been
for
patent
by
harold
winton
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
takes
on
another
phase
with
the
appointment
of
gordon
elliot
as
special
field
agent
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
holdings
the
new
field
agent
won
a
reputation
by
his
work
in
unearthing
the
oklahoma
gold
brick
land
frauds
elliot
leaves
seattle
in
the
queen
city
thursday
for
the
north
where
he
will
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
whole
situation
with
a
view
to
clearing
up
the
matter
definitely
if
his
report
is
favorable
to
the
claimants
the
patents
will
be
granted
without
further
delay
this
was
too
good
to
keep
holt
pulled
on
his
boots
and
went
out
to
twit
such
of
the
enemy
as
he
might
meet
it
chanced
that
the
first
of
them
was
selfridge
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
arrival
though
he
knew
the
little
man
was
in
camp
how
goes
it
holt
fine
and
dandy
eh
inquired
wally
with
the
professional
geniality
he
affected
the
old
miner
shook
his
head
dolefully
i
done
bust
my
laig
selfish
he
groaned
it
was
one
of
his
pleasant
ways
to
affect
a
difficulty
of
hearing
and
a
dullness
of
understanding
so
that
he
could
legitimately
call
people
by
distorted
versions
of
their
names
the
old
man
do
amount
to
much
nowadays
onct
a
man
or
a
horse
gits

i
do
reckon
either

any
more
nothing
to
that
gid
you
younger
than
you
ever
were
judging
by
your
looks
then
my
looks

to
beat
hell
mr
selfish
my
name
is
selfridge
explained
wally
a
trifle
irritated
holt
put
a
cupped
hand
to
his
ear
anxiously
shellfish
did
you
say
tha
right
howcome
i
to
forget
the
old
man
going
pretty
fast
shellfish
no
more
memory
than
a
jackrabbit
say
shellfish
what
the
idee
of
all
this
here
movement
as
the
old
sayin
is
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
my
name
is
selfridge
i
tell
you
snapped
the
owner
of
that
name
i
ai
got
no
more
sense
than
the
law
allows
i
a
buzzard
haid
but
me
i
kinder
got
to
millin
it
over
and
in
respect
to
these
here
local
improvements
as
you
might
say
i
doggoned
if
i
the
whyfor
there
was
an
imp
of
malicious
deviltry
in
the
black
beady
eyes
sparkling
at
selfridge
from
between
narrowed
lids
just
some
business
changes
we
making
holt
showed
his
teeth
in
a
grin
splenetic
oh
all
i
did
know
but
what
you
might
be
expecting
a
visitor
selfridge
flashed
a
sharp
sidelong
glance
at
him
what
do
you
mean
a
visitor
i
just
got
a
notion
mebbe
you
might
be
looking
for
one
pelfrich
but
i
do
know
sic
like
as
not
you
ai
fixing
up
for
this
gordon
elliot
wally
had
no
unless
it
was
one
to
retort
in
ironic
admiration
you
a
wonder
holt
pity
you
do
start
a
detective
bureau
the
old
man
went
away
cackling
dryly
if
selfridge
had
held
any
doubts
before
he
discarded
them
now
holt
would
wreck
the
whole
enterprise
were
he
given
a
chance
it
would
never
do
to
let
elliot
meet
and
talk
with
him
he
knew
too
much
and
he
was
eager
to
tell
all
he
knew
macdonald
lieutenant
got
busy
at
once
with
plans
to
abduct
holt
that
it
was
very
much
against
the
law
did
not
disturb
him
much
so
long
as
his
chief
stood
back
of
him
the
unsupported
word
of
the
old
man
would
not
stand
in
court
and
if
he
became
obstreperous
they
could
always
have
him
locked
up
as
a
lunatic
the
very
pose
of
the
old
miner
the
pretension
that
he
was
half
a
fool
would
lend
itself
to
such
a
charge
we
send
the
old
man
off
on
a
prospecting
trip
with
some
of
the
boys
explained
selfridge
to
rowland
that
way
we
kill
two
birds
he
back
on
his
assessment
work
the
time
limit
will
be
up
before
he
returns
and
we
start
a
contest
for
the
claim
howland
made
no
comment
he
was
an
engineer
and
not
a
politician
in
his
position
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
know
that
a
good
deal
about
the
legal
status
of
the
macdonald
claims
was
irregular
but
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
a
alaska
in
the
use
of
the
territory
by
those
who
had
settled
it
the
men
back
of
the
big
scotchman
were
going
to
spend
millions
in
development
work
in
building
railroads
it
would
help
labor
and
business
the
whole
north
would
feel
a
healthful
reaction
from
the
kamatlah
activities
so
on
the
theory
that
the
end
sometimes
justifies
doubtful
means
he
shut
his
eyes
to
many
acts
that
in
his
own
private
affairs
he
would
not
have
countenanced
better
arrange
it
with
big
bill
then
but
do
tell
me
anything
about
it
i
do
want
to
know
the
details
he
told
selfridge
big
bill
macy
accepted
the
job
with
a
grin
there
was
double
pay
in
it
both
for
him
and
the
men
he
chose
as
his
assistants
he
had
never
liked
old
holt
anyhow
besides
they
were
not
going
to
do
him
any
harm
holt
was
baking
a
batch
of
bread
that
evening
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
cabin
door
at
sight
of
big
bill
and
his
two
companions
the
prospector
closed
the
oven
and
straightened
with
alert
suspicion
he
was
not
on
visiting
terms
with
any
of
these
men
why
had
they
come
to
see
him
he
asked
the
question
in
his
mind
we
going
prospecting
up
creek
and
we
want
you
to
go
along
gid
explained
macy
you
an
old
miner
and
agree
we
like
to
have
you
with
us
what
say
the
old
miner
answer
was
direct
but
not
flattering
what
do
i
want
to
go
on
a
mush
with
a
bunch
of
bums
for
he
shrilled
bill
macy
scratched
his
hook
nose
and
looked
reproachfully
at
his
host
at
least
holt
thought
he
was
looking
at
him
one
could
not
be
sure
for
bill
eyes
did
not
exactly
track
that
ai
no
kind
o
way
to
talk
to
a
fellow
when
he
comes
at
you
with
a
fair
proposition
gid
you
tell
selfridge
i
ai
going
to
leave
kamatlah
not
right
now
going
to
stay
here
on
the
job
till
that
land
office
inspector
comes
and
then
i
going
to
have
a
nice
long
confidential
chat
with
him
see
what
the
use
of
snapping
at
me
like
a
turtle
durden
says
looks
fine
there
gold
up
there
heaps
of
it
let
it
stay
there
then
i
ai
going
that
flat
holt
turned
to
adjust
the
damper
of
his
stove
oh
i
do
know
i
would
say
that
drawled
bill
insolently
the
man
at
the
stove
caught
the
change
in
tone
and
turned
quickly
he
was
too
late
macy
had
thrown
himself
forward
and
the
weight
of
his
body
flung
holt
against
the
wall
before
the
miner
could
recover
the
other
two
men
were
upon
him
they
bore
him
to
the
floor
and
in
spite
of
his
struggles
tied
him
hand
and
foot
big
bill
rose
and
looked
down
derisively
at
his
prisoner
better
change
your
mind
and
go
with
us
holt
we
spend
a
quiet
month
up
at
the
headquarters
of
say
you
come
along
you
go
to
prison
for
this
bill
macy
guess
again
gid
and
mebbe
you
get
it
right
this
time
macy
turned
to
his
companions
george
you
bring
up
the
horses
dud
see
if
that
bread
is
cooked
might
as
well
take
it
along
with
us
save
us
from
baking
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
demanded
holt
i
reckon
you
need
a
church
to
fall
on
you
before
you
can
take
a
hint
did
i
mention
creek
three
or
four
times
jeered
his
captor
every
step
you
take
will
be
one
toward
the
penitentiary
get
that
into
your
cocoanut
the
old
miner
retorted
sharply
nothing
to
that
idee
gid
i
scream
when
you
take
me
out
go
to
it
then
we
gag
you
holt
made
no
further
protest
he
was
furious
but
at
present
quite
helpless
however
it
went
against
the
grain
he
might
as
well
give
in
until
rebellion
would
do
some
good
ten
minutes
later
the
party
was
moving
silently
along
the
trail
that
led
to
the
hills
the
went
first
in
charge
of
george
holway
the
prisoner
walked
next
his
hands
tied
behind
him
big
bill
followed
and
the
man
he
had
called
dud
brought
up
the
rear
they
wound
up
a
rising
valley
entering
from
it
a
cañon
with
precipitous
walls
that
shut
out
the
late
sun
it
was
by
this
time
past
eleven
and
dusk
was
gathering
closer
the
winding
trail
ran
parallel
with
the
creek
sometimes
through
thickets
of
young
fir
and
sometimes
across
boulder
beds
that
made
traveling
difficult
and
slow
they
went
in
single
file
each
of
them
with
a
swarm
of
mosquitoes
about
his
head
macy
had
released
the
hands
of
his
prisoner
so
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
fight
the
singing
pests
but
he
kept
a
wary
eye
upon
him
and
never
let
him
move
more
than
a
few
feet
from
him
the
trail
grew
steeper
as
it
neared
the
head
of
the
cañon
till
at
last
it
climbed
the
left
wall
and
emerged
from
the
gulch
to
an
uneven
mesa
the
leader
of
the
party
looked
at
his
watch
past
midnight
we
camp
here
george
and
see
if
we
ca
get
rid
of
the
they
built
smudge
fires
of
green
wood
and
on
the
lee
side
of
these
another
one
of
dry
sticks
dud
made
coffee
upon
this
and
cooked
bacon
to
eat
with
the
fresh
bread
they
had
taken
from
the
oven
of
holt
while
george
chopped
wood
for
the
fires
and
boughs
of
small
firs
for
bedding
big
bill
sat
with
a
rifle
across
his
knees
just
back
of
the
prisoner
gid
a
shifty
old
cuss
and
i
ai
taking
any
chances
he
explained
aloud
to
dud
holt
was
beginning
to
take
the
outrage
philosophically
he
sat
close
to
a
smudge
and
smoked
his
pipe
i
would
either
if
i
were
you
sometime
when
you
ai
watching
liable
to
grab
that
gun
and
shoot
a
hole
in
the
place
where
your
brains
would
be
if
you
had
any
countered
the
old
man
he
slept
peacefully
while
they
took
turns
watching
him
just
now
there
would
be
no
chance
to
escape
but
in
a
few
days
they
would
become
careless
the
habit
of
feeling
that
they
had
him
securely
would
grow
upon
them
then
reasoned
holt
his
opportunity
would
come
one
of
the
guards
would
take
a
chance
perhaps
he
might
even
fall
asleep
on
duty
it
was
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
in
the
next
week
or
two
he
would
not
catch
them
napping
once
for
a
short
ten
seconds
there
was
of
course
just
the
possibility
that
they
intended
to
murder
him
but
holt
could
not
associate
selfridge
with
anything
so
lawless
the
man
was
too
soft
of
fiber
to
carry
through
such
a
programme
and
as
yet
there
was
need
of
nothing
so
drastic
no
this
little
kidnapping
expedition
would
not
run
to
murder
he
would
be
set
free
in
a
few
weeks
and
if
he
told
the
true
story
of
where
he
had
been
his
foes
would
spread
the
report
that
he
was
insane
in
his
hatred
of
macdonald
and
imagined
all
sorts
of
persecutions
they
followed
creek
all
next
day
getting
always
closer
to
its
headwaters
near
the
divide
on
the
third
day
they
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
and
descended
into
a
little
mountain
park
they
were
in
a
country
where
prospectors
never
came
one
deserted
even
by
trappers
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
country
was
so
much
a
primeval
wilderness
that
a
big
bull
moose
stalked
almost
upon
their
camp
before
discovering
the
presence
of
a
strange
biped
big
bill
snatched
up
a
rifle
and
took
a
shot
which
sent
the
intruder
scampering
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
a
faint
sound
what
was
that
asked
george
sounded
like
a
shot
mebbe
it
was
an
echo

came
too
late
for
an
echo
big
bill
said
again
faintly
from
some
far
corner
of
the
basin
the
sound
drifted
it
was
like
the
pop
of
a
scarcely
heard
firecracker
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
at
their
prisoner
their
eyes

conceded
even
as
he
spoke
there
came
the
crack
of
a
revolver
almost
at
the
entrance
to
the
draw
one
of
the
men
swore
softly
the
gimlet
eyes
of
the
old
miner
fastened
on
the
spot
where
in
another
moment
his
rescuers
would
appear
a
man
staggered
drunkenly
into
view
he
reeled
halfway
across
the
mouth
of
the
draw
and
stopped
his
eyes
questing
dully
fell
upon
the
camp
he
stared
as
if
doubtful
whether
they
had
played
him
false
then
lurched
toward
the
waiting
group
lost
and
all
in
holway
said
in
a
whisper
to
dud
the
other
man
nodded
neither
of
them
made
a
move
toward
the
stranger
who
stopped
in
front
of
their
camp
and
looked
with
glazed
eyes
from
one
to
another
his
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
and
lined
extreme
exhaustion
showed
in
every
movement
he
babbled
incoherently

he
said
thickly
do
you
see

and
out
of
his
head
snapped

brusquely
get
him
grub
the
old
man
rose
and
moved
toward
the
suffering
man
come
pard
all
right
sit
down
right
here
and
go
to
it
as
the
old
sayin
is
he
led
the
man
to
a
place
beside
big
bill
and
made
him
sit
down
better
light
a
fire
boys
and
get
some
coffee
on
do
give
him
too
much
solid
grub
at
first
the
famished
man
ate
what
was
given
him
and
clamored
for
more
coming
up
soon

told
him
soothingly
now

now
the
stranger
clucked
to
an
imaginary
horse
and
made
a
motion
of
lifting
with
his
hands
looks
like
his
hawss
bogged
down
in
swamp
suggested
holt
looks
like
agreed
dud
the
old
miner
said
no
more
but
his
eyes
narrowed
to
shining
slits
if
this
man
had
come
through
swamp
he
must
have
started
from
the
river
that
probably
meant
that
he
had
come
from
kusiak
he
was
a
young
man
talking
the
jargon
of
a
college
football
player
without
doubt
he
was
in
the
old
phrasing
of
the
north
a
chechako
his
clothing
though
much
soiled
and
torn
had
been
good
his
voice
held
the
inflections
of
the
cultured
world
gideon

sly
brain
moved
keenly
to
the
possibility
that
he
could
put
a
name
to
this
human
derelict
they
had
picked
up
he
began
to
see
it
as
more
than
a
possibility
as
even
a
probability
at
least
as
a
chance
a
sardonic
grin
hovered
about
the
corners
of
his
grim
mouth
it
would
be
a
strange
freak
of
irony
if
wally
selfridge
to
prevent
a
meeting
between
him
and
the
government
land
agent
had
sent
him
a
hundred
miles
into
the
wilderness
to
save
the
life
of
gordon
elliot
and
so
had
brought
about
the
meeting
that
otherwise
would
never
have
taken
place
chapter
x
the
boy
functions
big
bill
grumbled
a
good
deal
at
the
addition
to
the
party
it
would
be
decidedly
awkward
if
this
stranger
should
become
rational
and
understand
the
status
of
the
camp
he
had
joined
the
word
of
old
holt
alone
might
be
negligible
but
supported
by
that
of
a
disinterested
party
it
would
be
a
very
different
matter
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
they
would
have
to
take
care
of
the
man
until
he
was
able
to
travel
perhaps
he
would
go
in
with
them
as
an
additional
guard
at
the
worst
big
bill
could
give
him
a
letter
to
selfridge
explaining
things
and
so
pass
the
buck
to
that
gentleman
gid
holt
had
with
the
tacit
consent
of
his
guards
appointed
himself
as
a
sort
of
nurse
to
the
stranger
he
lit
a
smudge
fire
to
the
windward
side
of
him
fed
him
small
quantities
of
food
at
intervals
and
arranged
a
for
him
with
mosquito
netting
for
protection
early
in
the
evening
the
sick
man
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
from
which
he
did
not
awake
until
morning
george
was
away
looking
after
the
dud
was
cooking
breakfast
and
big
bill
his
rifle
close
at
hand
was
chopping
young
firs
fifty
feet
back
of
the
camp
the
cook
also
had
a
gun
loaded
with
buckshot
lying
on
a
box
beside
him
so
that
they
were
taking
no
chances
with
their
prisoner
he
could
not
have
covered
twenty
yards
without
being
raked
by
a
the
old
miner
turned
from
rearranging
the
boughs
of
green
fir
on
the
smudge
to
see
that
his
patient
was
awake
and
his
mind
normal
the
quiet
steady
eyes
resting
upon
him
told
that
the
delirium
had
passed
pretty
nearly
all
in
was
i
the
young
man
said
the
answer
of
gid
holt
was
an
odd
one
yep
seven

fifteen
take
easy
old
man
he
said
in
his
shrill
high
voice
as
he
moved
toward
the
man
in
the
blankets
then
in
a
low
tone
while
he
pretended
to
arrange
the
bedding
over
the
stranger
he
asked
a
quick
question
are

elliot
yes

them

as
if
you
was
still
out
of
your
haid
holt

and
called
to
dud
says
he
wants
some
breakfast
on
the
way
the
cook
answered
holt
seemed
to
be
soothing
the
delirious
man
what
he
really
said
was
this
selfridge

for
you
at

the

so
as
to
keep

from
telling

the
truth
pst
tune
up
now
big
bill
had
put
down
his
axe
and
was
approaching
he
was
not
exactly
suspicious
but
he
did
not
believe
in
taking
unnecessary
chances
i
tell
you
i
out
of
training
played
the
last
game
have
we
come

querulous
voice
he
turned
to
macy

played
the
game
all
fall
do
i
get
what
i
want
now
we
through
the
voice
of
the
young
man
was
excited
his
eyes
had
lost
their
quiet
steadiness
and
roved
restlessly
to
and
fro
if
big
bill
had
held
any
doubts
one
glance
dissipated
them
sure
you
do
hustle
over
and
help
dud
with
the
breakfast
holt
look
out
for
our
friend
elliot
and
holt
found
no
more
chance
to
talk
together
that
morning
sometimes
the
young
government
official
lay
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
sometimes
he
appeared
to
doze
again
he
would
talk
in
the
disjointed
way
of
one
not
clear
in
the
head
an
opportunity
came
in
the
afternoon
for
a
moment
keep
your
eyes
skinned
for
a
chance
to
lay
out
the
guard
and
get
his
gun

said
quickly
gordon
nodded
i
do
know
that
i
got
to
do
everything
just
as
you
say
he
complained
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
george
who
was
passing
on
his
way
to
the
place
where
the
horses
were
hobbled
now
now
there

explained
in
a
patient
voice
they

invalid
some
scrapper

said
the

wrangler
with
a
grin
macy
took
the
first
watch
that
night
he
turned
in
at
two
after
he
had
roused
dud
to
take
his
place
the
cook
had
been
on
duty
about
an
hour
when
elliot
kicked
holt
who
was
sleeping
beside
him
to
make
sure
that
he
was
ready
the
old
man
answered
the
kick
with
another

got
up

and
strolled
toward

edge
of

cautioned
dud
gordon
on
his
way
back
passed
behind
the

was
sitting
tailor
fashion
before
a
smudge
with
a
muley
shotgun
across
his
knees
this
ai
no

for
chechakoes
to
be

around
without

the

continued

like
your

would
have
better
sense
than
to
let
their
boy
he
got
no
farther
elliot
dropped
to
one
knee
and
his
strong
fingers
closed
on
the
gullet
of
the
man
so
tightly
that
not
even
a
groan
could
escape
him
his
feet
thrashed
to
and
fro
as
he
struggled
but
he
could
not
shake
off
the
grip
that
was
strangling
him
the
old
miner
waiting
with
every
muscle
ready
and
every
nerve
under
tension
flung
aside
his
blanket
and
hurled
himself
at
the
guard
it
took
him
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
to
wrest
the
gun
from
the
cook
he
got
to
his
feet
just
as
big
bill
his
eyes
and
brain
still
fogged
with
sleep
sat
up
and
began
to

when

if

so
darned
anxious
about
it
our
young
friend
would
have
died
here
on

selfridge
kindly
outfitted
a
party
and
sent

hundred
miles
into

long
time
had
he
enjoyed
himself
so
much
better
begin
with
chief
big
bill
he
suggested
no
i
would
make
that
move
if
i
was
you
macy
this
old
gun
is
liable
to
go
off
accidental
in
your
direction
and
she
spatters
like
hell
that
the
idee
be
reasonable
not
that
i
give
a
hoot
but
a
man
had
ought
to
let
his
impulses
run
away
with
his
judgment
as
the
old
sayin
is
gordon
tied
the
hands
of
big
bill
behind
him
then
roped
his
feet
together
after
which
he
did
the
same
for
holway
the
old
miner
superintended
the
job
and
was
not
satisfied
till
he
had
added
a
few
extra
knots
on
his
own
behalf
that
hold
them
for
awhile
i
should
wonder
now
if
you
just
cover
friend
chef
with
this
gat
elliot
i
throw
the
diamond
hitch
over
what
supplies
we
need
to
get
back
to
kamatlah
i
take
one
bronch
and
leave
the
other
to
the
convicts
said
holt
cheerfully
forget
that
convict
stuff
growled
macy
with
macdonald
back
of
us
and
the
guttenchilds
back
of
him
you
have
a
hectic
time
getting
anything
on
us
that
might
be
true
if
these
folks
were
back
of
you
but
are
they
course
i
ai
any
sherlock
holmes
but
it
do
look
to
me
like
play
any
such
fool
system
as
this
big
bill
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
and
said
nothing
he
had
caught
a
look
flashed
at
him
by
holway
a
look
that
warned
him
he
was
talking
too
much
after
holt
had
packed
one
of
the
animals
he
turned
to
elliot
i
reckon
we
ready
under
orders
from
elliot
dud
fixed
up
the
smudges
and
arranged
the
mosquito
netting
over
the
bound
men
so
as
to
give
them
all
the
protection
possible
we
going
to
take
dud
with
us
for
a
part
of
the
trip
we
send
him
back
to
you
later
in
the
day
you
have
to
fast
till
he
gets
back
but
outside
of
that
you
do
very
well
if
you
do
roll
around
trying
to
get
loose
do
that
and
you
jar
loose
the
mosquito
netting
you
know
what
that
means
explained
gordon
it
ai
likely
any
grizzlies
will
come
pokin
their
noses
into
camp
but
you
never
can
tell
any
last
words
you
want
sent
to
relatives
asked
gideon
holt
the
last
words
they
heard
from
big
bill
as
they
moved
down
the
draw
were
sulphuric
macy
he
ai
wearin
any
bryan
smile
this
glad
mused
old
holt
aloud
it
was
three
in
the
morning
by
the
watch
when
they
started
about
nine
they
threw
off
for
breakfast
by
this
time
they
were
just
across
the
divide
and
were
ready
to
take
the
down
trail
i
think
we
let
dud
go
now
elliot
told
his
partner
in
the
adventure
better
hold
him
till
afternoon
then
they
ca
possibly
reach
us
till
we
get
to
kamatlah
what
does
it
matter
if
they
do
we
have
both
rifles
and
have
left
them
only
one
revolver
besides
i
do
like
to
leave
two
bound
men
alone
in
so
wild
a
district
for
any
great
time
no
we
start
dud
on
the
back
trail
that
grizzly
you
promised
big
bill
might
really
turn
up
the
two
men
struck
the
headwaters
of
creek
about
noon
and
followed
the
stream
down
they
traveled
steadily
without
haste
so
long
as
they
kept
a
good
lookout
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
the
men
they
had
left
behind
they
had
both
a
long
start
and
the
advantage
of
weapons
if
elliot
had
advertised
for
a
year
he
could
not
have
found
a
man
who
knew
more
of
colby
macdonald
past
than
gideon
holt
the
old
man
had
mushed
on
the
trail
with
him
in
the
klondike
days
he
had
worked
a
claim
on
frenchman
creek
with
him
and
had
by
sharp
practice
so
at
least
he
had
come
to
believe
been
lawed
out
of
his
rights
by
the
shrewd
scotchman
for
seventeen
years
he
had
nursed
a
grudge
against
macdonald
and
he
was
never
tired
of
talking
about
him
he
knew
many
doubtful
things
charged
to
the
account
of
the
big
man
as
he
had
blazed
a
way
to
success
over
the
failures
of
less
fortunate
people
one
story
in
particular
interested
gordon
it
came
out
the
second
day
as
they
were
getting
down
into
the
foothills
there
was
farrell
he
was
a
good
fellow
farrell
was
but
he
had
just
one
weakness
there
was
times
when
he
liked
the
bottle
too
well
he
let
it
alone
for
months
and
then
just
lap
the
stuff
up
it
was
the
time
of
the
stampede
to
bonanza
creek
men
are
just
like
sheep
they
wear
wool
on
their
backs
like
them
and
have
their
habits
you
can
start
any
fool
way
for
no
cause
do
you
know
it
well
the
news
of
the
strike
on
bonanza
reached
dawson
and
we
all
burnt
up
the
trail
to
get
to
the
new
ground
first
was
one
of
the
first
he
got
in
about
twenty
below
discovery
if
i
remember
mac
was
in
dawson
but
he
got
there
next
and
heard
the
news
he
lit
out
for
bonanza
the
old
miner
stopped
took
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
looked
down
into
the
valley
far
below
where
kamatlah
could
just
be
seen
a
little
huddle
of
huts
well
asked
elliot
it
was
occasionally
necessary
to
prompt
holt
when
he
paused
for
his
dramatic
effects
he
would
pretend
to
forget
that
he
was
telling
a
yarn
which
might
interest
his
hearer
mac
draps
in
and
joins
at
night
they
knew
each
other
understand
so
o
course
it
was
natural
mac
would
put
up
at
his
camp
had
a
partner
and
they
had
located
together
fellow
named
strong
not
hanford
strong
a
little
man
somewhere
around
fifty
gordon
asked
quickly
you
tagged
the
right
man
know
him
i
met
him
well
i
never
heard
anything
against
han
strong
anyway
he
was
off
that
night
packing
grub
up
while
farrell
held
down
the
claim
mac
had
a
jug
of
booze
with
him
he
got
farrell
tanked
up
you
know
mac
how
he
can
put
it
across
when
he
a
mind
to
he
a
forceful
devil
and
he
can
be
a
mighty
likable
one
elliot
nodded
understanding
he
always
the
head
of
the
table
no
matter
where
he
sits
and
there
is
something
wonderfully
attractive
about
him
sure
there
is
but
when
he
is
friendliest
you
want
to
watch
out
he
do
slip
an
upper
cut
at
you
that
put
you
out
of
biz
he
done
that
to
farrell
and
done
it
how
got
mellowed
up
till
he
thought
mac
was
his
best
friend
he
was
ready
to
eat
out
of
his
hand
so
mac
works
him
up
to
sign
a
contract
before
witnesses
too
trust
mac
for
that
exchanging
his
in
the
claim
for
five
hundred
dollars
in
cash
and
lease
on
frenchman
creek
inside
of
a
week
mac
and
strong
struck
a
big
pay
streak
they
took
over
two
hundred
thousand
from
the
spring
it
was
nothing
better
than
robbery
call
it
what
you
want
to
anyhow
it
stuck
kicked
and
all
the
good
it
did
him
he
consulted
lawyers
at
dawson
finally
he
got
so
discouraged
that
he
plumb
went
to
pieces
got
on
a
long
bat
and
stayed
there
till
his
money
ran
out
then
one
bitter
night
he
starts
up
to
bonanza
to
have
it
out
with
mac
the
mercury
was
so
low
it
had
run
into
the
ground
a
foot
farrell
slept
in
a
deserted
cabin
without
a
fire
and
not
enough
bedding
he
caught
pneumony
by
the
time
he
reached
the
claim
he
was
a
mighty
sick
man
next
week
he
died
that
all
mac
done
to
not
a
thing
that
was
legal
either
gordon
thought
of
sheba
as
she
sat
listening
to
the
tales
of
macdonald
in
diane
parlor
and
his
gorge
rose
at
the
man
but
mac
had
fell
on
his
feet
all
right
continued
holt
he
got
his
start
off
that
claim
now
he
a
millionaire
two
or
three
times
over
i
reckon
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
kamatlah
about
noon
of
the
third
day
gordon
left
holt
at
his
cabin
after
they
had
eaten
and
went
in
alone
to
look
the
ground
over
he
met
selfridge
at
the
that
gentleman
was
effusive
in
his
greeting
this
a
pleasant
surprise
elliot
when
did
you
get
in
had
no
idea
you
were
coming
or
i
have
asked
you
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
i
down
on
business
of
course
no
need
to
tell
you
that
nobody
would
come
to
this
hole
for
any
other
reason
howland
and
his
wife
are
the
only
possible
people
here
hope
you
play
bridge
elliot
played
it
but
he
did
not
say
so
it
was
his
business
not
to
be
drawn
into
entangling
alliances
of
course
you
put
up
with
me
as
my
guest
selfridge
flowed
on
i
wanted
to
meet
you
again
ever
since
we
were
on
the
hannah
together
this
was
a
little
too
cheeky
gordon
recalled
with
some
amusement
how
this
tubby
little
man
and
his
friends
had
ignored
the
existence
of
sheba
and
himself
for
several
days
he
answered
genially
pleasant
time
we
had
on
the
river
did
we
thanks
awfully
for
your
invitation
but
i
already
made
arrangements
for
putting
up
where
there
no
decent
place
in
camp
except
at
howland
he
keeps
open
house
for
our
friends
i
could
think
of
troubling
him
countered
gordon
no
trouble
at
all
we
send
for
your
things
where
are
they
the
land
agent
let
him
have
it
right
between
the
eyes
at
gideon
holt
i
staying
with
him
on
his
claim
wally
had
struck
a
match
to
light
a
cigarette
but
this
simple
statement
petrified
him
his
jaw
dropped
and
his
eyes
bulged
not
till
the
flame
burned
his
fingers
did
he
come
to
life
did
you
say
you
were
staying
with
gid
holt
he
floundered
weakly
gordon
noticed
that
his
florid
face
had
lost
its
color
the
jaunty
of
the
man
had
flickered
out
like
the
flame
of
the
charred
match
yes
he
offered
to
board
me
answered
the
young
man
blandly
but
i
did
know
he
was
here
seems
to
me
i
had
heard
somewhere
that
he
was
away
he
was
away
but
he
has
come
back
gordon
gave
the
information
without
even
a
flash
of
mirth
in
his
steady
eyes
selfridge
could
not
quite
let
the
subject
alone
seems
to
me
i
heard
he
went
prospecting
he
did
up
creek
with
big
bill
macy
and
two
other
men
but
i
asked
him
to
come
back
with
me
and
he
did
feebly
wally
groped
for
the
clue
without
finding
it
had
big
bill
sold
him
out
and
how
had
elliot
got
into
touch
with
him
just
so
elliot
but
really
you
know
howland
can
make
you
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
than
holt
his
wife
is
a
famous
cook
i
have
a
man
go
get
your
traps
it
very
good
of
you
but
i
think
i
wo
move
oh
but
you
must
holt
nutty
nobody
at
home
you
know
everybody
knows
that
is
he
the
old
man
struck
me
as
being
remarkably
by
the
way
i
want
to
thank
you
for
sending
a
relief
party
out
to
find
me
selfridge
except
for
your
help
i
would
have
died
in
the
hills
this
was
another
facer
for
wally
what
the
devil
did
the
fellow
mean
the
deuce
of
it
was
that
he
knew
all
the
facts
and
wally
did
not
he
talked
as
if
he
meant
it
but
behind
those
cool
eyes
there
might
lie
either
mockery
or
irony
one
thing
alone
stood
out
to
selfridge
like
a
sore
thumb
his
plans
had
come
tumbling
down
like
a
house
of
cards
either
big
bill
had
blundered
amazingly
or
he
had
played
traitor
in
either
case
wally
could
guess
pretty
shrewdly
whose
hide
macdonald
would
tan
for
the
failure
the
chief
wanted
results
he
did
not
ask
of
his
subordinates
how
they
got
them
and
this
was
the
second
time
in
succession
that
selfridge
had
come
to
grief
chapter
xi
gordon
invites
himself
to
dinner
and
does
not
enjoy
it
big
bill
and
his
companions
reached
kamatlah
early
next
day
they
reported
at
once
to
selfridge
it
had
been
the
intention
of
wally
to
vent
upon
them
the
bad
temper
that
had
been
gathering
ever
since
his
talk
with
elliot
but
his
first
sarcastic
question
drew
such
a
snarl
of
anger
that
he
reconsidered
the
men
were
both
sullen
and
furious
they
let
him
know
roundly
that
if
holt
made
them
any
trouble
through
the
courts
they
would
tell
all
they
knew
the
little
man
became
alarmed
instead
of
reproaches
he
gave
them
soft
words
and
promises
the
company
would
see
them
through
it
would
protect
them
against
criminal
procedure
but
above
all
they
must
stand
pat
in
denial
a
conviction
would
be
impossible
even
if
the
state
attorney
filed
an
indictment
against
them
meanwhile
they
would
remain
on
the
company
gordon
elliot
was
a
trained
investigator
even
without
holt
at
his
side
he
would
probably
have
unearthed
the
truth
about
the
kamatlah
situation
but
with
the
little
miner
by
his
side
to
tell
him
the
facts
he
found
his
task
an
easy
one
selfridge
followed
orders
and
let
him
talk
with
the
men
freely
all
of
them
had
been
drilled
till
they
knew
their
story
like
parrots
they
were
suspicious
of
the
approaches
of
elliot
but
they
had
been
warned
that
they
must
appear
to
talk
candidly
the
result
was
that
some
talked
too
much
and
some
not
enough
they
contradicted
themselves
and
one
another
they
let
slip
admissions
under
skillful
examination
that
could
be
explained
on
no
other
basis
than
that
of
company
ownership
both
selfridge
and
howland
outdid
themselves
in
efforts
to
establish
close
social
relations
but
gordon
was
careful
to
put
himself
under
no
obligations
he
called
on
the
howlands
but
he
laughingly
explained
why
he
could
not
accept
the
invitations
of
howland
to
dinner
i
have
to
tell
things
here
as
i
see
them
and
may
not
have
your
point
of
view
how
can
i
accept
your
hospitality
and
then
report
that
i
think
your
husband
ought
to
be
sent
up
for
life
she
was
a
good
motherly
woman
and
she
laughed
with
him
but
she
did
wish
this
pleasant
young
fellow
could
be
made
to
take
the
proper
view
of
things
within
two
weeks
elliot
had
finished
his
work
at
kamatlah
off
for
kusiak
he
told
holt
that
night
the
old
miner
went
with
him
as
a
guide
to
the
big
bend
gordon
had
no
desire
to
attempt
again
swamp
without
the
help
of
some
one
who
knew
every
foot
of
the
trail
holt
had
taken
the
trip
a
dozen
times
with
him
to
show
the
way
the
swamp
became
merely
a
hard
grueling
mush
through
boggy
lowlands
weary
with
the
trail
they
reached
the
river
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
an
indian
village
lay
sprawled
along
the
bank
and
through
this
the
two
men
tramped
to
the
roadhouse
where
they
were
to
put
up
for
the
night
holt
called
to
the
younger
man
who
was
at
the
time
in
the
lead
wait
a
minute
elliot
gordon
turned
the
old
alaskan
was
offering
a
quarter
to
a
little
indian
boy
shyly
the
came
forward
a
step
at
a
time
his
finger
in
his
mouth
he
held
out
a
brown
hand
for
the
coin
what
your
name
kid
holt
flashed
a
look
at
elliot
that
warned
him
to
pay
attention
colmac
the
boy
answered
bashfully
his
fist
closed
on
the
quarter
he
turned
and
like
a
startled
caribou
he
fled
to
a
comely
young
indian
woman
standing
near
the
trail
with
gleaming
eyes
holt
turned
to
elliot
take
a
good
look
at
the
squaw
he
said
in
a
low
voice
elliot
glanced
at
the
woman
behind
whose
skirts
the
youngster
was
hiding
he
smiled
and
nodded
pleasantly
to
her
she
not
bad
looking
if
that
what
you
mean
he
said
after
they
had
taken
up
the
trail
again
you
ai
the
only
white
man
that
has
thought
that
retorted
the
old
miner
significantly
no
gordon
had
learned
to
let
holt
tell
things
at
his
leisure
it
usually
took
less
time
than
to
try
to
hurry
him
name
of
the
kid
mean
anything
to
you
ca
say
it
did
hm
named
for
his
dad
first
syllable
of
each
of
his
names
the
land
inspector
stopped
in
his
stride
and
wheeled
upon
holt
his
eyes
asked
eagerly
a
question
you
do
mean
colby
macdonald
why
do
i
but
good
lord
he
is
a
squawman
is
he
not
in
the
usual
meaning
of
the
word
she
never
cooked
and
kept
house
for
him
just
the
same
little
colmac
is
his
kid
could
you
see
it
sticking
out
all
over
him
he
the
image
of
his
dad
i
see
it
now
you
pointed
it
out
i
was
trying
to
think
who
he
reminded
me
of
of
course
it
was
macdonald
mac
met
up
with
meteetse
when
he
first
scouted
this
country
for
coal
five
years
ago
so
far
i
know
he
was
square
enough
with
the
girl
she
never
claimed
he
made
any
promises
or
anything
like
that
he
sends
a
check
down
once
a
quarter
to
the
trader
here
for
her
and
the
kid
but
young
elliot
was
not
thinking
about
meteetse
his
mind
eye
saw
another
picture
the
girl
at
kusiak
listening
spellbound
to
the
tales
of
a
man
whose
actions
translated
romance
into
life
for
her
a
girl
swept
from
the
quiet
backwaters
of
an
irish
village
to
this
land
of
the
midnight
sun
with
its
amazing
contrasts
and
all
the
way
up
on
the
boat
she
continued
to
fill
his
mind
the
slowness
of
the
steamer
fretted
him
he
paced
up
and
down
the
deck
for
hours
at
a
time
worried
and
anxious
sometimes
the
jealousy
in
his
heart
flamed
up
like
a
prairie
fire
when
it
comes
to
a
brush
heap
the
outrage
of
it
set
him
blazing
with
indignation
diane
ought
to
be
whipped
he
told
himself
for
her
part
in
the
deception
it
was
no
less
than
a
conspiracy
what
could
an
innocent
young
girl
like
sheba
know
of
such
a
man
as
colby
macdonald
her
imagination
conceived
no
doubt
an
idealized
vision
of
him
but
the
real
man
was
clear
outside
her
ken
gordon
set
his
jaw
grimly
he
would
have
it
out
with
diane
he
would
let
her
see
she
was
not
going
to
have
it
all
her
own
way
by
god
he
would
put
a
spoke
in
her
wheel
sometimes
when
the
cool
evening
breezes
blew
on
his
bare
fevered
head
he
laughed
at
himself
for
an
idiot
how
did
he
know
that
macdonald
wanted
sheba
all
the
evidence
he
had
was
that
he
had
once
seen
the
man
watch
her
while
she
sang
a
sentimental
song
whereas
it
was
common
talk
that
he
would
probably
marry
mallory
that
for
months
he
had
been
her
almost
daily
companion
if
the
older
woman
had
lost
the
sweet
supple
slimness
of
her
first
youth
she
had
won
in
exchange
a
sophisticated
grace
a
seductive
allure
that
made
her
the
envy
of
all
the
women
with
whom
she
associated
she
held
at
command
a
warm
languorous
charm
which
had
stirred
banked
fires
in
the
hearts
of
many
men
why
should
not
macdonald
woo
her
gordon
himself
admitted
her
attractiveness
and
why
should
he
take
it
for
granted
that
sheba
was
ready
to
drop
into
the
arms
of
the
big
alaskan
whenever
he
said
the
word
at
the
least
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
she
surely
she
might
admire
him
without
falling
in
love
with
the
man
was
there
not
something
almost
insulting
in
the
supposition
that
macdonald
had
only
to
speak
to
her
in
order
to
win
but
in
spite
of
reason
he
was
on
fire
to
come
to
his
journey
end
no
sooner
had
he
reached
his
hotel
than
he
called
up
paget
quite
clearly
she
understood
that
he
wanted
an
invitation
to
dinner
yet
she
hesitated
my
ca
be
working
well
gordon
told
her
gayly
you
must
have
asked
me
to
dinner
but
i
did
just
hear
it
never
mind
i
be
there
seven
did
you
say
diane
laughed
you
just
as
much
a
boy
as
you
were
ten
years
ago
gord
all
right
come
along
but
you
to
leave
at
ten
do
you
understand
no
i
ca
hear
that
my
has
gone
bad
again
and
if
i
had
heard
i
should
think
of
doing
anything
so
ridiculous
as
leaving
at
that
hour
it
would
be
an
insult
to
your
hospitality
i
know
when
well
off
then
i
have
to
withdraw
my
invitation
perhaps
some
other
day
i
leave
at
ten
promised
elliot
meekly
he
could
almost
hear
the
smile
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
very
well
seven
sharp
i
explain
about
the
curfew
limit
sometime
macdonald
was
with
miss
in
the
when
gordon
arrived
at
the
paget
home
sheba
came
forward
to
greet
the
new
guest
the
welcome
in
her
eyes
was
very
genuine
you
and
macdonald
know
each
other
of
course
she
said
after
her
handshake
the
scotchman
nodded
his
lean
grizzled
head
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
field
agent
there
was
always
a
certain
deliberation
about
his
manner
but
it
was
the
slowness
of
strength
and
not
of
weakness
yes
i
know
elliot
now
i
not
so
sure
that
he
knows
me
yet
i
beginning
to
know
you
rather
well
macdonald
answered
gordon
quietly
but
with
a
very
steady
look
if
the
alaskan
wanted
to
declare
war
he
was
ready
for
it
the
field
agent
knew
that
selfridge
had
sent
reports
detailing
what
had
happened
at
kamatlah
up
to
date
macdonald
had
offered
him
the
velvet
glove
he
wondered
if
the
time
had
come
when
the
fist
of
steel
was
to
be
doubled
paget
was
frankly
pleased
to
see
gordon
again
he
was
a
simple
honest
man
who
moved
always
in
a
straight
line
he
had
liked
elliot
as
a
boy
and
he
still
liked
him
so
did
diane
for
that
matter
but
she
was
a
little
on
her
guard
against
him
she
had
certain
plans
under
way
that
she
intended
to
put
through
she
was
not
going
to
let
even
gordon
elliot
frustrate
them
did
you
have
a
successful
trip
mr
elliot
asked
sheba
innocently
paget
grinned
behind
his
hand
the
girl
question
was
like
a
match
to
powder
and
every
one
in
the
room
knew
it
but
she
the
interests
and
his
convictions
were
on
the
side
of
macdonald
but
he
recognized
that
elliot
had
been
sent
in
to
gather
facts
for
the
government
and
not
to
give
advice
to
it
if
he
played
fair
he
could
only
tell
the
truth
as
he
saw
it
the
eyes
of
diane
held
a
spark
of
hostility
as
she
leaned
forward
the
word
had
already
been
passed
among
the
faithful
that
this
young
man
was
not
taking
the
right
point
of
view
did
you
gordon
echoed
his
hostess
i
think
so
he
answered
quietly
i
hear
you
put
up
with
old
gideon
holt
is
he
as
cracked
as
he
used
to
be
asked
macdonald
was
he
cracked
when
you
used
to
know
him
on
frenchman
creek
countered
the
young
man
macdonald
shot
a
quick
slant
look
at
him
the
old
man
had
been
talking
had
he
he
was
cracked
and
broke
too
laughed
the
hardily
cracked
when
he
came
broke
when
he
left
yes
that
was
one
of
the
stories
he
told
me
gordon
turned
to
sheba
you
should
meet
the
old
man
miss
he
knew
your
father
at
dawson
and
on
bonanza
the
girl
was
all
eagerness
i
like
to
does
he
ever
come
to
kusiak
nonsense
cut
in
diane
sharply
she
flashed
at
gordon
a
look
of
annoyance
he
nothing
but
a
daft
old
idiot
my
dear
the
dinner
had
started
wrong
and
though
paget
steered
the
conversation
to
safer
ground
it
did
not
go
very
well
at
least
three
of
those
present
were
a
little
on
edge
even
sheba
who
had
missed
entirely
the
point
of
the
veiled
thrusts
knew
that
elliot
was
not
in
harmony
with
either
diane
or
macdonald
gordon
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
could
not
quite
have
told
what
were
the
impulses
that
had
moved
him
to
carry
the
war
into
the
camp
of
the
enemy
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
it
had
been
a
certain
look
of
quiet
assurance
in
the
eyes
of
his
rival
when
he
looked
at
sheba
he
rose
promptly
at
ten
must
you
go
so
soon
diane
asked
she
was
smiling
at
him
with
bland
mockery
i
really
must
answered
elliot
his
hostess
followed
him
into
the
hall
she
watched
him
get
into
his
coat
before
saying
what
was
on
her
mind
what
did
you
mean
by
telling
sheba
that
old
holt
knew
her
father
what
is
he
to
tell
her
if
they
meet
that
her
father
died
of
pneumonia
brought
on
by
drink
is
that
what
you
want
gordon
was
honestly
contrite
i
did
think
of
that
no
you
were
too
busy
thinking
of
something
mean
to
say
to
mr
macdonald
he
agreed
yet
could
not
forbear
one
dig
more
i
suppose
i
wanted
holt
to
tell
her
that
macdonald
robbed
her
father
and
indirectly
was
the
cause
of
his
death
absurd
exploded
diane
you
so
simple
that
you
accept
as
true
the
gossip
of
every
idiot
when
it
suits
your
purpose
he
smiled
boyishly
engagingly
as
he
held
out
his
hand
do
quarrel
di
i
admit
i
forgot
myself
all
right
we
wo
but
do
believe
all
the
catty
talk
you
hear
gordon
i
try
to
believe
only
the
truth
he
smiled
a
little
ruefully
and
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
explain
why
the
curfew
law
applies
to
me
and
not
to
macdonald
she
was
on
her
dignity
at
once
you
quite
right
it
is
necessary
but
i
going
to
tell
you
anyhow
macdonald
is
going
away
for
two
or
three
days
and
he
has
some
business
he
wants
to
talk
over
with
sheba
he
had
made
an
appointment
with
her
and
i
did
think
it
fair
to
let
your
coming
interfere
with
it
gordon
took
this
facer
with
his
smile
still
working
i
got
a
little
business
i
want
to
talk
over
with
di
she
had
always
been
a
young
woman
of
rather
a
hard
finish
now
she
met
him
fairly
eye
to
eye
any
time
you
like
gordon
elliot
carried
away
with
him
one
very
definite
impression
diane
intended
sheba
to
marry
macdonald
if
she
could
bring
it
about
she
had
as
good
as
served
notice
on
him
that
the
girl
was
spoken
for
the
young
man
set
his
square
jaw
diane
was
used
to
having
her
own
way
so
was
macdonald
well
the
elliots
had
a
will
of
their
own
too
chapter
xii
sheba
says
perhaps
obeying
the
orders
of
the
general
in
command
peter
took
himself
to
his
den
with
the
excuse
that
he
had
to
work
over
presently
diane
said
she
thought
she
heard
one
of
the
children
crying
and
left
to
investigate
the
scotchman
strode
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
glowing
coals
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
break
the
silence
and
sheba
glanced
at
his
strong
brooding
face
a
little
apprehensively
her
excitement
showed
in
the
color
that
was
beating
into
her
cheeks
she
knew
of
only
one
subject
that
would
call
for
so
formal
a
private
talk
between
her
and
macdonald
and
any
discussion
of
this
she
would
very
much
have
liked
to
postpone
he
turned
from
the
fire
to
sheba
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
plunged
straight
at
what
he
wanted
to
say
i
asked
to
see
you
alone
miss
because
i
want
to
make
a
confession
and
restitution
to
begin
with
he
told
her
abruptly
she
had
a
sense
of
suddenly
stilled
pulses
that
sounds
very
serious
the
young
woman
smiled
faintly
his
face
of
chiseled
granite
masked
all
emotion
it
kept
under
lock
and
key
the
insurgent
impulses
that
moved
him
when
he
looked
into
the
sloe
eyes
charged
with
reserve
back
of
them
he
felt
was
the
mystery
of
purity
of
maidenhood
he
longed
to
know
her
better
to
find
out
and
to
appropriate
for
himself
the
woman
that
lay
behind
the
fine
veil
of
flesh
she
seemed
to
him
delicate
as
a
flame
and
as
vivid
there
would
come
a
day
when
her
innocent
passional
nature
would
respond
to
the
love
of
a
man
as
a
waiting
harp
does
to
skillful
fingers
my
story
goes
away
back
to
the
klondike
days
i
told
you
that
i
knew
your
father
on
frenchman
creek
but
i
did
say
much
about
knowing
him
on
bonanza
strong
has
told
me
something
about
the
days
on
bonanza
and
i
knew
you
would
tell
me
more
some
day
when
you
wanted
to
speak
about
it
she
was
seated
in
a
low
chair
and
the
white
throat
lifted
toward
him
was
round
as
that
of
a
bird
your
father
was
among
the
first
of
those
who
stampeded
to
bonanza
he
and
strong
took
up
a
claim
together
i
bought
out
the
interest
of
your
father
you
told
me
that
his
masterful
eyes
fastened
to
hers
i
did
tell
you
that
i
took
advantage
of
him
he
was
not
well
i
used
that
against
him
in
the
bargaining
he
wanted
ready
money
and
i
tempted
him
do
you
mean
that
you
wronged
him
yes
i
cheated
him
he
was
resolved
to
gloss
over
nothing
to
offer
no
excuses
i
did
know
there
was
gold
on
his
claim
but
i
had
what
we
call
a
hunch
i
took
his
claim
without
giving
value
received
it
was
her
turn
now
to
look
into
the
fire
and
think
from
the
letters
of
her
father
from
talks
with
she
knew
how
in
the
stampedes
every
man
hand
had
been
for
himself
how
had
been
the
passion
for
gold
a
veritable
lust
that
corroded
the
souls
of
men
but
i
do
understand
her
brave
steady
eyes
looked
directly
into
those
of
macdonald
if
he
felt
you
had
done
him
a
wrong
why
did
he
come
to
you
when
he
was
ill
he
was
coming
to
demand
justice
of
me
on
the
way
he
suffered
exposure
and
caught
pneumonia
the
word
reached
us
and
strong
and
i
brought
him
to
our
cabin
you
faced
a
blizzard
to
bring
him
in
strong
told
me
how
you
risked
your
life
by
carrying
him
through
the
storm
how
you
would
give
up
and
leave
him
though
you
were
weak
and
staggering
yourself
he
says
it
was
a
miracle
you
ever
got
through
the
big
brushed
this
aside
as
of
no
importance
we
leave
sick
men
to
die
in
a
blizzard
up
north
but
that
not
the
point
i
think
it
has
a
bearing
on
the
matter
that
you
saved
him
from
the
blizzard
and
took
him
in
and
nursed
him
like
a
brother
till
he
died
i
not
heartless
said
macdonald
impatiently
of
course
i
did
that
i
had
to
do
it
i
could
do
less
or
more
she
suggested
you
may
have
made
a
hard
bargain
with
him
but
you
wiped
that
out
later
that
just
what
i
did
do
do
think
my
conscience
is
troubling
me
i
not
such
a
fool
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
i
would
never
have
thought
of
it
again
but
you
are
his
daughter
what
i
cheated
him
out
of
belongs
to
you
and
you
are
my
friend
do
use
that
word
about
what
you
did
please
he
was
a
child
if
you
got
the
best
of
him
in
a
bargain
i
do
think
father
would
think
of
it
that
way
the
difficulty
was
that
he
could
not
tell
her
the
truth
about
her
father
weakness
for
drink
and
how
he
had
played
upon
it
he
bridged
all
explanations
and
passed
to
the
thing
he
meant
to
do
in
reparation
the
money
i
cleaned
up
from
that
claim
belongs
to
you
miss
you
will
oblige
me
by
taking
it
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
folded
paper
and
handed
it
to
her
sheba
opened
it
doubtfully
the
paper
contained
a
typewritten
statement
and
to
it
was
attached
a
check
by
means
of
a
clip
the
check
was
made
out
to
her
and
signed
by
colby
macdonald
the
amount
it
called
for
was
one
hundred
and
thousand
four
hundred
and
dollars
oh
i
could
take
this
macdonald
i
could
it
does
belong
to
me
she
cried
it
belongs
to
you
and
you
going
to
take
it
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
the
bank
will
take
care
of
it
for
you
until
you
decide
so
settled
he
passed
definitely
from
the
subject
there
something
else
i
want
to
say
to
you
miss
some
change
in
his
voice
warned
her
the
girl
slanted
a
quick
shy
glance
at
him
i
want
to
know
if
you
marry
me
miss
he
shot
at
her
abruptly
then
without
giving
her
time
to
answer
he
pushed
on
i
older
than
you
by
years
always
i
lived
on
the
frontiers
i
had
to
take
the
world
by
the
throat
and
shake
from
it
what
i
wanted
so
i
grown
hard
and
willful
all
the
sweet
fine
things
of
life
i
missed
but
with
you
beside
me
i
not
too
old
to
find
them
yet
if
you
show
me
the
way
sheba
a
wave
of
color
swept
into
her
face
but
her
eyes
never
faltered
from
his
i
not
quite
sure
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
mean
whether
you
love
me
she
nodded
i
admire
you
more
than
any
man
i
ever
met
you
are
a
great
man
strong
and
powerful
and
i
am
so
insignificant
beside
you
i
am
drawn
to
you
so
much
but
i
am
not
sure
afterward
when
she
thought
of
it
sheba
wondered
at
the
direct
ease
of
his
proposal
in
the
romances
she
had
read
men
were
shy
and
embarrassed
and
fearful
of
the
issue
but
colby
macdonald
had
known
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
had
said
it
as
coolly
and
as
readily
as
if
it
had
been
a
business
detail
she
was
the
one
that
had
blushed
and
stammered
and
found
a
difficulty
in
expressing
herself
i
going
away
for
two
days
perhaps
when
i
come
back
you
will
know
sheba
take
your
time
marriage
is
serious
business
i
want
you
to
remember
that
my
life
has
been
very
different
from
yours
you
hear
all
sorts
of
things
about
me
some
of
them
are
true
there
is
this
difference
between
a
man
and
a
good
woman
he
fights
and
falls
and
fights
again
and
wins
but
a
good
woman
is
finer
she
has
never
known
the
failure
that
drags
one
through
slime
and
mud
her
goodness
is
born
in
her
she
does
have
to
fight
for
it
the
girl
smiled
a
little
tremulously
does
she
we
not
all
angel
you
know
i
hope
you
not
there
will
need
to
be
a
lot
of
the
human
in
you
to
make
allowances
for
colby
macdonald
he
replied
with
an
answering
smile
when
he
said
it
was
with
a
warm
strong
handshake
i
be
back
in
two
days
perhaps
you
have
good
news
for
me
then
he
suggested
the
dark
silken
lashes
of
her
eyes
lifted
shyly
to
meet
his
perhaps
she
said
chapter
xiii
diane
and
gordon
differ
during
the
absence
of
macdonald
the
field
agent
saw
less
of
sheba
than
he
had
expected
and
when
he
did
see
her
she
had
an
abstracted
manner
he
did
not
quite
understand
she
kept
to
her
own
room
a
good
deal
except
when
she
took
long
walks
into
the
hills
back
of
the
town
diane
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
the
alaskan
had
put
his
fortune
to
the
test
and
she
not
only
let
her
cousin
alone
herself
but
fended
gordon
from
her
adroitly
the
third
day
after
the
dinner
elliot
dropped
around
to
the
pagets
with
intent
to
get
sheba
into
a
set
of
tennis
diane
sat
on
the
porch
darning
socks
sheba
is
out
walking
with
macdonald
she
explained
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
her
guest
oh
he
back
is
he
remarked
gordon
moodily
paget
was
quite
cheerful
on
that
subject
he
came
back
this
morning
sheba
has
gone
up
with
him
to
see
the
lucky
strike
you
going
to
marry
her
to
that
man
if
you
can
are
you
he
charged
if
i
can
gordon
she
slipped
a
into
one
of
little
peter
stockings
and
placidly
trimmed
the
edges
of
the
hole
it
what
i
call
a
conspiracy
is
it
diane
smiled
gordon
understood
her
smile
to
mean
that
he
was
jealous
maybe
i
am
that
not
the
point
he
answered
just
as
if
she
had
made
her
accusation
in
words
suppose
you
tell
me
what
the
point
is
she
suggested
both
amused
and
annoyed
he
is
good
enough
for
her
you
know
that
perfectly
well
good
enough
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
man
good
enough
for
a
nice
girl
if
you
come
to
that
there
are
other
things
beside
sugary
goodness
any
man
who
is
strong
can
make
himself
good
enough
for
the
woman
he
loves
generally
speaking
yes
but
colby
macdonald
is
different
thank
heaven
he
is
she
retorted
impatiently
then
added
after
a
moment
he
is
a
superintendent
if
that
what
you
mean
that
is
what
i
mean
at
all
but
there
such
a
thing
as
a
difference
between
right
and
wrong
is
there
oh
yes
for
instance
macdonald
is
right
about
the
need
of
developing
alaska
and
the
way
to
do
it
and
you
are
wrong
he
could
not
help
smiling
a
little
at
the
adroit
way
she
tried
to
sidetrack
him
even
though
he
was
angry
at
her
but
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
her
go
without
freeing
his
mind
i
talking
about
essential
right
and
wrong
miss
is
idealizing
macdonald
i
do
suppose
you
told
her
for
instance
that
he
made
his
first
money
in
the
north
running
a
dance
hall
no
i
have
told
her
any
such
thing
because
it
is
true
she
replied
scornfully
he
owned
an
opera
house
and
brought
in
a
company
of
players
i
dare
say
they
danced
that
very
different
as
you
know
if
you
did
have
astigmatism
of
the
mind
not
the
way
the
story
was
told
me
but
let
that
pass
does
she
know
that
macdonald
beat
her
father
out
of
one
of
the
best
claims
on
bonanza
and
was
indirectly
responsible
for
his
death
what
the
use
of
talking
nonsense
gordon
you
know
you
ca
prove
that
his
friend
told
him
sharply
i
think
i
can
if
it
is
necessary
diane
looked
across
at
him
with
an
impudent
little
tilt
of
the
chin
i
do
think
i
like
you
as
well
as
i
used
to
sorry
because
i
like
you
just
as
well
diane
if
you
would
stop
trying
to
manage
your
cousin
into
a
marriage
that
will
spoil
her
life
he
answered
gravely
how
dare
you
say
that
how
dare
you
gordon
elliot
she
flung
back
furious
at
him
i
wo
have
you
here
talking
that
way
to
me
it
an
insult
the
fearless
level
eyes
of
her
friend
looked
straight
at
her
i
say
it
because
the
happiness
of
miss
is
of
very
great
importance
to
me
do
you
mean
she
looked
her
question
straight
at
him
that
just
what
i
mean
diane
she
darned
for
a
minute
in
silence
it
had
occurred
to
diane
before
that
perhaps
gordon
might
be
in
love
with
sheba
but
she
had
put
the
thought
from
her
because
she
did
not
want
to
believe
it
that
different
gordon
it
explains
and
in
a
way
excuses
your
coming
here
and
trying
to
bully
me
she
stopped
her
work
to
flash
a
question
at
him
do
you
think
that
maybe
it
only
a
fancy
of
yours
i
remember
you
used
he
shook
his
head
no
chance
diane
i
hard
hit
she
the
only
girl
i
ever
met
that
suited
me
everything
she
does
is
right
every
move
she
makes
is
wonderful
the
eyes
with
which
she
looked
at
him
were
softer
as
those
of
women
are
wont
to
be
for
the
true
romance
you
poor
boy
she
murmured
and
let
her
hand
for
a
moment
rest
on
his
meaning
that
i
lose
he
asked
quickly
i
think
you
do
i
not
sure
elliot
leaned
forward
impulsively
be
a
good
sport
diane
let
me
have
my
chance
too
why
do
you
make
it
easy
for
macdonald
and
hard
for
me
is
it
because
the
glamour
of
his
millions
blinds
you
he
a
big
splendid
man
but
i
do
like
him
any
the
less
because
he
has
the
power
to
make
life
easy
and
comfortable
for
sheba
she
defended
sturdily
yet
you
turned
down
arthur
west
the
best
catch
in
your
set
to
marry
peter
who
was
the
worst
he
reminded
her
have
you
ever
been
sorry
for
it
that
different
peter
and
i
fit
it
was
one
case
out
of
a
million
she
gave
him
her
old
friendly
smile
but
i
do
want
to
be
hard
on
you
gord
i
be
neutral
come
and
see
sheba
as
often
as
she
let
you
gordon
beamed
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
that
sounds
like
the
di
paget
i
used
to
know
she
recurred
to
the
previous
question
sheba
knows
more
about
macdonald
than
you
think
and
about
how
he
got
her
father
claim
for
instance
she
has
heard
all
that
you
told
her
no
colby
macdonald
told
her
he
said
he
practically
robbed
her
father
and
he
gave
her
a
check
for
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
to
cover
the
from
the
claim
and
interest
bully
for
him
on
the
heel
of
this
he
flung
a
question
at
her
did
macdonald
ask
her
to
marry
him
the
night
of
the
dinner
a
flash
of
whimsical
amusement
lit
her
dainty
face
you
better
ask
him
that
here
he
comes
now
they
were
coming
down
the
walk
together
macdonald
and
sheba
the
young
woman
was
absorbed
in
his
talk
and
she
did
not
know
that
her
cousin
and
elliot
were
on
the
porch
until
she
was
close
upon
them
but
at
sight
of
the
young
man
her
eyes
became
warm
and
kind
i
sorry
i
was
out
yesterday
when
you
called
she
told
him
and
you
were
out
again
my
luck
is
very
good
is
it
he
laughed
pleasantly
but
his
heart
was
bitter
he
believed
macdonald
had
won
some
hint
of
proprietorship
in
his
manner
together
with
her
slight
confusion
when
she
saw
them
on
the
porch
had
weighted
his
heart
with
lead
we
had
such
a
good
walk
sheba
went
on
quickly
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
macdonald
telling
me
how
he
once
had
a
chance
to
save
a
small
esquimaux
tribe
during
a
hard
winter
he
carried
food
five
hundred
miles
to
them
it
was
a
thrilling
experience
macdonald
has
had
a
lot
of
very
interesting
experiences
you
must
get
him
to
tell
you
about
all
of
them
answered
gordon
quietly
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
the
ones
of
the
older
man
answered
the
challenge
of
his
rival
with
a
long
steady
look
there
was
in
it
something
of
triumph
something
of
scornful
insolence
if
this
young
fellow
wanted
war
he
did
not
need
to
wait
long
for
it
time
enough
for
that
man
miss
and
i
have
the
whole
arctic
winter
before
us
for
stories
the
muscles
in
the
lean
jaws
of
gordon
elliot
stood
out
like
steel
ropes
he
turned
to
sheba
am
i
to
congratulate
mr
macdonald
the
color
in
her
cheeks
grew
warmer
but
her
shy
glance
met
his
fairly
i
think
it
is
i
that
am
to
be
congratulated
mr
elliot
diane
took
her
cousin
in
her
arms
my
dear
i
wish
you
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
she
said
softly
the
irish
girl
fled
into
the
house
as
soon
as
she
could
but
not
before
making
an
announcement
we
to
be
married
soon
very
quietly
if
you
are
still
at
kusiak
we
want
you
to
be
one
of
the
few
friends
present
mr
elliot
macdonald
backed
her
invitation
with
a
cool
cynical
smile
miss
speaks
for
us
both
of
course
elliot
the
defeated
man
bowed
thanks
very
much
the
chances
are
that
i
be
through
my
business
here
before
then
as
soon
as
his
fiancée
had
gone
into
the
house
the
scotchman
left
gordon
sat
down
in
a
porch
chair
and
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
the
suddenness
of
the
news
had
brought
his
world
tumbling
about
his
ears
he
felt
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
an
outrage
against
innocence
but
he
was
not
yet
far
enough
away
from
the
blow
to
ask
himself
how
much
the
personal
hurt
influenced
his
opinion
though
she
was
sorry
for
him
diane
did
not
think
it
best
to
say
so
yet
presently
he
spoke
thickly
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
he
was
a
squawman
his
friend
joined
battle
promptly
with
him
that
ridiculous
do
be
absurd
gordon
it
the
truth
i
seen
the
woman
she
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
old
gideon
holt
likely
she
flashed
one
could
get
evidence
and
show
it
to
miss
he
said
aloud
to
himself
rather
than
to
her
diane
put
her
point
of
view
before
him
with
heated
candor
could
nobody
but
a
cad
would
rake
up
old
scandals
about
the
man
who
has
beaten
him
fairly
for
a
woman
love
you
beg
the
question
he
won
fairly
of
course
he
has
be
a
good
sport
gordon
do
kick
on
the
decision
play
the
game
that
all
very
well
but
what
about
her
am
i
to
sit
quiet
while
she
is
sacrificed
to
a
code
of
honor
that
seems
to
me
rooted
in
dishonor
she
is
not
being
sacrificed
i
her
cousin
i
very
fond
of
her
and
i
trust
her
with
colby
macdonald
play
fair
diane
tell
her
the
truth
about
this
indian
woman
and
let
your
cousin
decide
for
herself
you
ca
do
less
can
you
paget
was
distinctly
annoyed
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
gordon
elliot
you
take
all
the
gossip
of
a
old
idiot
for
gospel
truth
just
because
you
want
to
believe
the
worst
about
macdonald
do
you
know
that
people
will
say
anything
about
a
man
who
succeeds
colby
macdonald
is
too
big
and
too
aggressive
not
to
have
made
hundreds
of
enemies
his
life
has
been
threatened
dozens
of
times
but
he
pays
no
attention
to
it
goes
right
on
this
country
yet
you
think
he
had
a
cloven
hoof
to
hear
some
people
talk
i
no
patience
with
them
the
woman
name
is
meteetse
gordon
said
in
an
even
voice
just
as
if
he
were
answering
a
question
she
is
young
and
for
an
indian
her
boy
is
four
or
five
years
old
colmac
they
call
him
and
he
looks
just
like
macdonald
people
are
always
tracing
resemblances
there
nothing
to
that
but
suppose
his
life
irregular
years
ago
this
is
boston
it
used
to
be
the
fringe
of
civilization
men
did
as
they
pleased
in
the
early
days
we
do
ask
a
man
up
here
what
he
has
been
but
what
he
is
you
ought
to
know
that
by
this
time
this
was
in
the
early
days
it
was
five
years
ago
when
macdonald
was
examining
the
kamatlah
i
told
he
sends
a
check
down
the
river
once
a
month
for
the
woman
all
the
more
credit
to
him
if
he
does
diane
rose
and
looked
stormily
down
at
her
friend
you
about
as
broad
as
a
clam
gordon
ca
you
see
that
even
if
it
true
all
that
is
done

and
looked
across
at
the
mountains
his
square
jaw
was
set
when
he
turned
it
back
toward

going
to
marry

he
said
quietly
he
walked
out
of

gate
and
down
the
walk
toward
his
hotel

waiting
for

chapter
xiv
genevieve
mallory
takes
a
hand
inside
of
an
hour
the
news
of
the
engagement
of
macdonald
was
all
over
kusiak
it
was
through
a
telephone
receiver
that
the
gossip
was
buzzed
to
mallory
by
a
friend
who
owed
her
a
little
stab
the
voice
of
genevieve
mallory
registered
faint
amusement
but
as
soon
as
she
had
hung
up
her
face
fell
into
haggard
lines
she
had
staked
a
year
of
her
waning
youth
on
winning
the
big
mining
man
of
kusiak
together
with
all
the
money
that
she
had
been
able
to
scrape
up
for
a
campaign
outfit
moreover
she
liked
him
it
was
not
in
the
picture
that
she
should
fall
desperately
in
love
with
any
man
a
woman
of
the
world
she
was
sheathed
in
the
plate
armor
of
selfishness
but
she
was
as
near
to
loving
macdonald
as
was
possible
for
her
she
had
a
great
deal
of
admiration
for
his
iron
strength
for
the
grit
of
the
man
no
woman
could
twist
him
around
her
finger
yet
it
was
possible
to
lead
him
a
long
way
in
the
direction
one
wanted
mallory
sat
down
in
the
hall
beside
the
telephone
her
fingers
laced
about
one
crossed
knee
she
knew
that
if
sheba
had
not
come
on
the
scene
macdonald
would
have
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
had
been
moving
slowly
toward
her
for
months
they
understood
each
other
and
were
at
ease
together
between
them
was
a
strong
physical
affinity
both
were
and
were
wise
enough
to
expect
human
imperfection
then
diane
paget
had
brought
in
this
slim
young
cousin
of
hers
and
colby
macdonald
had
been
fascinated
by
the
mystery
of
her
innocent
youth
mallory
was
like
steel
beneath
the
soft
and
indolent
surface
swiftly
she
mapped
her
plan
of
attack
the
alaskan
could
not
be
moved
but
it
might
be
possible
to
startle
the
girl
into
breaking
the
engagement
genevieve
mallory
would
have
used
the
weapon
at
hand
without
scruple
in
any
case
but
she
justified
herself
on
the
ground
that
such
a
marriage
could
result
only
in
unhappiness
but
before
she
made
any
move
mallory
intended
to
be
sure
of
her
facts
it
was
like
her
to
go
to
headquarters
for
information
she
got
macdonald
on
the
wire
i
just
heard
something
nice
about
you
do
tell
me
it
true
she
said
her
voice
warm
with
sympathy
macdonald
laughed
with
an
almost
boyish
embarrassment
it
true
i
reckon
i
so
glad
she
a
lovely
girl
the
sweetest
thing
that
ever
lived
i
sure
you
be
happy
i
always
did
think
you
would
make
a
perfect
husband
of
course
i
simply
green
with
envy
of
her
her
little
ripple
of
laughter
was
gay
and
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
never
had
liked
her
better
since
he
was
not
a
fool
he
had
guessed
pretty
closely
how
things
stood
with
her
she
was
a
game
little
sport
he
told
himself
approvingly
it
appealed
to
him
immensely
that
she
could
take
such
a
facer
and
come
up
smiling
there
were
no
signs
of
worry
wrinkles
on
her
face
when
the
maid
admitted
a
caller
half
an
hour
later
oliver
dustin
was
the
name
on
the
card
he
was
a
remittance
man
a
tame
little
parlor
pet
whose
vocation
was
to
fetch
and
carry
for
pretty
women
and
by
some
odd
trick
of
fate
he
had
been
sifted
into
the
northland
mallory
had
tolerated
him
rather
scornfully
but
she
smiled
upon
him
propped
up
by
pillows
she
reclined
luxuriously
on
a
lounge
a
thin
spiral
of
smoke
rose
like
incense
to
the
ceiling
from
her
lips
the
slow
regular
rise
and
fall
of
her
breathing
beneath
the
filmy
lace
of
her
gown
accented
the
perfect
fullness
of
bust
and
throat
dustin
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
and
made
himself
comfortable
she
set
herself
to
win
him
he
was
immensely
flattered
at
her
awakened
interest
when
she
called
him
by
his
first
name
he
wagged
all
over
like
a
pleased
puppy
it
came
to
him
after
a
time
that
she
was
considering
him
for
a
confidential
mission
he
assured
her
eagerly
that
there
was
no
trouble
too
great
for
him
to
take
if
he
could
be
of
any
service
to
her
she
hesitated
and
doubted
and
at
last
as
a
special
favor
to
him
accepted
his
offer
their
heads
were
close
in
whispered
talk
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
dustin
left
the
room
with
his
chin
in
the
air
he
was
a
knight
errant
in
the
employ
of
the
most
attractive
woman
north
of
when
elliot
took
the
boat
he
found
oliver
dustin
was
a
fellow
passenger
the
little
man
smoked
an
occasional
cigar
with
the
land
agent
and
aired
his
views
on
politics
and
affairs
social
he
left
the
boat
at
the
big
bend
without
giving
him
much
of
his
thought
gordon
was
a
little
surprised
that
the
voluble
remittance
man
had
not
told
him
where
he
was
going
not
till
a
week
later
did
elliot
return
up
the
river
he
was
asleep
at
the
time
the
sarah
passed
the
big
bend
but
next
morning
he
discovered
that
selfridge
and
dustin
had
come
aboard
during
the
night
in
the
afternoon
he
came
upon
a
real
surprise
when
he
found
meteetse
and
her
little
boy
colmac
seated
upon
a
box
on
the
lower
deck
where
freight
for
local
points
was
stored
his
guess
was
that
they
were
local
passengers
but
wharf
after
wharf
slipped
behind
them
and
the
two
still
remained
on
board
they
appeared
to
know
nobody
else
on
the
sarah
though
once
gordon
met
dustin
just
as
he
was
hurrying
away
from
the
indian
woman
the
little
remittance
man
took
the
pains
to
explain
to
elliot
later
that
he
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
indians
knew
any
english
meteetse
transferred
with
the
other
kusiak
passengers
at
the
river
junction
the
field
agent
was
not
the
only
one
on
board
who
wondered
where
she
was
going
selfridge
was
consumed
with
curiosity
and
when
she
and
the
boy
got
off
at
kusiak
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
gordon
saw
wally
talking
with
her
meteetse
showed
him
an
envelope
which
evidently
had
an
address
written
upon
it
for
the
little
man
pointed
out
to
her
the
direction
in
which
she
must
go
since
leaving
kusiak
nearly
two
weeks
before
no
word
had
reached
gordon
of
sheba
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
dinner
at
the
hotel
he
walked
out
to
the
paget
house
and
sent
in
his
card
sheba
came
into
the
hall
to
meet
him
from
the
where
she
had
been
sitting
with
the
man
she
expected
to
marry
next
week
she
gave
a
little
murmur
of
pleasure
at
sight
of
him
and
held
out
both
hands
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
get
back
in
time
i
so
glad
she
told
him
warmly
he
managed
to
achieve
a
smile
when
is
the
great
day
next
thursday
of
course
we
as
busy
as
can
be
but
diane
says
a
ring
at
the
door
interrupted
her
sheba
stepped
forward
and
let
in
an
indian
woman
with
a
little
boy
clinging
to
her
hand
you
miss
she
asked
yes
from
the
folds
of
her
shawl
she
drew
a
letter
the
girl
glanced
at
the
address
then
opened
and
read
what
was
written
she
looked
up
puzzled
first
at
the
comely
flatfooted
indian
woman
and
afterward
at
the
handsome
little
papoose
she
turned
to
gordon
this
letter
says
i
am
to
ask
this
woman
who
is
the
father
of
her
boy
what
does
it
mean
gordon
knew
instantly
what
it
meant
though
he
could
not
guess
who
had
dealt
the
blow
he
hesitated
for
an
answer
and
in
his
embarrassment
she
felt
that
which
began
to
ring
a
bell
of
warning
in
her
heart
the
impulse
to
spare
her
pain
was
stronger
in
him
than
the
desire
that
she
should
know
the
truth
send
her
away
he
urged
do
ask
any
questions
she
has
been
sent
to
hurt
you
a
fawnlike
fear
flashed
into
the
startled
eyes
to
hurt
me
i
am
afraid
so
but
why
i
have
done
nobody
any
harm
she
seemed
to
hold
even
her
breathing
in
suspense
only
a
pulse
beat
wildly
in
her
white
throat
like
the
heart
of
an
imprisoned
thrush
perhaps
some
of
macdonald
enemies
he
suggested
and
at
that
there
came
a
into
the
soft
eyes
and
a
lifted
tilt
to
the
chin
cut
fine
as
a
cameo
she
turned
proudly
to
the
indian
woman
what
is
it
that
you
have
to
tell
me
about
this
boy
father
meteetse
began
to
speak
at
the
first
mention
of
macdonald
name
sheba
eyes
dilated
her
smile
her
sweet
glad
pleasure
at
arrival
were
already
gone
like
the
flame
of
a
blown
candle
clearly
her
heart
was
in
fear
of
she
knew
not
what
when
the
indian
woman
told
how
she
had
first
crossed
the
path
of
macdonald
the
color
flamed
into
the
cheeks
of
the
irish
girl
but
as
the
story
progressed
the
blood
ebbed
even
from
her
lips
with
a
swift
movement
of
her
fingers
she
flashed
on
the
hall
light
her
gaze
searched
the
brown
shiny
face
of
the
little
chap
she
read
there
an
affidavit
of
the
truth
of
his
mother
tale
the
boy
had
his
trick
of
squinting
a
slant
look
at
anything
he
found
interesting
it
was
impossible
to
see
him
and
not
recognize
colby
macdonald
reincarnated
what
is
your
name
asked
sheba
suddenly
the
youngster
hung
back
shyly
among
the
folds
of
the
indian
skirt
colmac
he
said
at
last
softly
come
sheba
flung
open
the
door
of
the
and
ushered
them
in
macdonald
pacing
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
during
her
absence
pulled
up
in
his
stride
he
stood
frowning
at
the
native
woman
then
his
eyes
passed
to
elliot
and
fastened
upon
him
the
face
of
the
scotchman
might
have
been
chipped
from
granite
it
was
grim
as
that
of
a
hanging
judge
gordon
started
to
explain
then
stopped
with
a
shrug
what
was
the
use
the
man
would
never
believe
him
in
the
world
i
remember
this
the
alaskan
promised
his
rival
there
was
a
cold
glitter
in
his
eyes
a
sudden
flare
of
the
devil
that
was
it
true
then
broke
in
sheba
you
a
a
squawman
you
belong
to
this
woman
nothing
of
the
kind
he
cried
roughly
that
been
ended
for
years
ended
sheba
drew
colmac
forward
by
the
wrist
do
you
deny
that
this
is
your
boy
the
big
alaskan
brushed
this
aside
as
of
no
moment
i
dare
say
he
is
anyhow
i
paying
for
his
keep
what
of
it
that
all
finished
and
done
with
how
can
it
be
done
with
when
when
she
the
mother
of
your
child
your
wife
before
god
the
live
eyes
attacked
him
from
the
dusk
that
framed
the
oval
of
her
pale
face
standing
there
straight
as
an
aspen
the
beautiful
bosom
rising
and
falling
quickly
while
the
storm
waves
beat
through
her
blood
sheba
had
never
made
more
appeal
to
the
strong
lawless
man
who
desired
her
for
his
wife
you
do
understand
macdonald
big
fists
were
clenched
so
savagely
that
the
knuckles
stood
out
white
from
the
brown
tan
of
the
flesh
this
is
a
man
country
it
new
close
to
nature
what
he
wants
he
takes
if
he
strong
enough
i
elemental
i
you
wanted
her
and
you
took
her
now
you
want
me
and
i
suppose
take
me
too
her
scornful
words
had
the
sting
of
a
whiplash
i
lived
as
all
men
live
who
have
red
blood
in
them
this
woman
is
an
incident
i
been
aboveboard
she
ca
say
i
ever
promised
more
than
i
given
i
kept
her
and
the
boy
it
been
no
secret
if
you
had
asked
i
would
have
told
you
the
whole
story
does
that
excuse
you
i
do
need
any
excuse
i
a
man
that
excuse
enough
you
been
brought
up
among
a
lot
of
conventions
and
social
lies
the
one
big
fact
you
want
to
set
your
teeth
into
now
is
that
i
love
you
that
there
another
woman
on
god
earth
for
me
and
that
there
never
will
be
again
her
eyes
flashed
battle
the
one
big
fact
i
facing
is
that
you
have
insulted
me
that
you
insult
me
again
when
you
mention
love
with
that
woman
and
boy
in
the
room
you
belong
to
them
go
to
them
and
leave
me
alone
she
had
been
fighting
for
to
curb
her
growing
resentment
but
now
it
flamed
passionately
into
words
i
hate
the
sight
of
you
why
do
you
go
all
of
you
and
leave
me
in
peace
it
was
a
cry
of
bruised
pride
and
wounded
love
elliot
touched
the
indian
woman
on
the
shoulder
meteetse
turned
stolidly
and
walked
out
of
the
room
still
leading
colmac
by
the
hand
the
young
man
followed
macdonald
closed
the
door
behind
them
then
strode
frowning
up
and
down
the
room
the
fear
was
growing
on
him
that
for
all
his
great
driving
power
he
could
not
shake
this
slim
girl
from
the
view
to
which
she
clung
if
the
situation
had
not
been
so
serious
it
would
have
struck
him
as
ridiculous
his
relation
with
meteetse
had
been
natural
enough
he
believed
that
he
had
acted
very
honorably
to
her
many
a
man
would
have
left
her
in
the
lurch
to
take
care
of
the
youngster
by
herself
but
he
had
acknowledged
his
obligation
he
was
paying
his
debt
scrupulously
and
because
of
it
the
story
had
risen
to
confront
him
he
felt
that
it
was
an
unjust
blow
of
fate
punishment
was
falling
upon
him
not
for
what
he
had
done
but
because
he
had
scorned
to
make
a
secret
of
it
he
knew
that
he
must
justify
himself
before
sheba
or
lose
her
as
she
stood
in
the
dusk
so
tall
and
rigid
he
knew
her
heart
was
steel
to
him
her
finely
chiseled
face
had
the
look
of
race
never
had
the
spell
of
her

more
upon
him
he
crushed
back
a
desire
to
take
her
supple
young
body
into
his
arms
and
kiss
her
till
the
scarlet
ran
into
her
cheeks
like
splashes
of
wine
you
have
the
proper
slant
on
this

she
demanded
with
the
inexorable
judgment
of
youth
did
you
leave
the
moral
code
at
home
when
you
came
in
over
the
ice
he
smiled
a
little
morality
is
the
average
conduct
of
the
average
man
at
a
given
time
and
place
it
is
based
on
custom
and
expediency
the
rules
made
for
drogheda

the

made
to
protect

would
be

meteetse
does
not
hold
herself
disgraced
but
honored
she
counts
her
boy
far
superior
to
the
other
youngsters
of
the
village
and
he
is
so
considered
by
the
tribe
i
am
told
she
lords
it
over
her
sisters
a
faint
flush
of
anger
had
crept
into

cheeks
your
view
of
morality
puts
us
on
a
level
with

animals
i
will
not
discuss
the
subject
if
you
please
we
must
discuss
it
i
must
get
you
to
see
that
meteetse
and

a
part
of
my
present
or

macdonald
paced
restlessly
down
the
room
and
back
he
moved
with
a
long
easy
tireless
stride
the
man
was
one
among
ten
thousand
dominant
virile
every
ounce
of
him
strong
as
tested
steel
but
he
felt
as
if
all
his
energy
were
caged
why
do
you
go
the
girl
pleaded
it
no
use
to
stay
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
i
going
to
marry
you
sheba
do
think
i
let
that
meddler
interfere
with
our
happiness
you
mine
no
never
she
cried
i
take
the
boat
and
go
home
first
you
promised
to
marry
me
you
going
to
keep
your
word
and
be
glad
of
it
all
your
life
she
shook
her
head
no
yes
macdonald
had
always
shown
remarkable
restraint
with
her
he
had
kissed
her
seldom
and
always
with
a
kind
of
awe
at
her
young
purity
now
he
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
his
eyes
deep
in
their
sockets
mirrored
the
passionate
desire
of
his
heart
the
color
flamed
into
her
face
she
looked
hot
to
the
touch
an
active
volcano
ready
to
erupt
there
was
an
odd
feeling
in
her
mind
that
this
big
man
was
a
stranger
to
her
take
your
hands
from
me
she
ordered
do
you
think
i
going
to
give
you
up
now
now
after
i
won
you
because
of
a
damfool
scruple
in
your
pretty
head
you
do
know
me
it
too
late
i
love
you
and
i
going
to
protect
both
of
us
from
your
prudishness
his
arms
closed
on
her
and
he
crushed
her
to
him
looking
down
hungrily
into
the
dark
little
face
let
me
go
she
cried
fiercely
struggling
to
free
herself
for
answer
he
kissed
the
red
lips
the
flaming
cheeks
the
angry
eyes
then
coming
to
his
senses
he
pushed
her
from
him
turned
and
strode
heavily
from
the
room
chapter
xv
gordon
buys
a
revolver
selfridge
was
not
eager
to
meet
his
chief
but
he
knew
he
must
report
at
once
he
stopped
at
his
house
only
long
enough
to
get
into
fresh
clothes
and
from
there
walked
down
to
the
office
over
the
paget
telephone
he
had
got
into
touch
with
macdonald
who
told
him
to
wait
at
headquarters
until
he
came
it
had
been
the
intention
of
macdonald
to
go
direct
from
sheba
to
his
office
but
the
explosion
brought
about
by
meteetse
had
sent
him
out
into
the
hills
for
a
long
tramp
he
was
in
a
stress
of
furious
emotion
and
until
he
had
worked
off
the
edge
of
it
by
hard
mushing
the
cramped
civilization
of
the
town
stifled
him
hours
later
he
strode
into
the
office
of
the
company
he
was
and
splashed
with
mud
fifteen
miles
of
stiff
walking
had
been
flung
behind
him
wally
lay
asleep
in
a
swivel
chair
his
fat
body
sagging
and
his
head
fallen
sideways
in
such
a
way
as
to
emphasize
the
plump
folds
of
his
double
chin
his
eyes
opened
they
took
in
his
chief
slowly
then
in
a
small
panic
he
jumped
to
his
feet
must
been
taking
thirty
winks
he
explained
been
up
nights
a
good
deal
what
doing
demanded
the
scotchman
harshly
in
a
hurried
attempt
to
divert
the
anger
of
macdonald
his
assistant
made
a
mistake
say
mac
who
do
you
think
came
up
on
the
boat
with
me
i
wondered
if
you
knew
meteetse
and
her
kid
he
stopped
the
big
man
was
glaring
savagely
at
him
but
macdonald
said
nothing
he
waited
and
under
the
compulsion
of
his
forceful
silence
wally
stumbled
on
they
got
off
here
i
did
know
whether
you
sent
for
her
or
not
so
i
stopped
and
kinder
gave
her
the
glad
hand
just
to
size
things
up
yes
she
had
the
address
of
miss
that
irish
girl
staying
at
the
pagets
the
one
that
came
in
go
on
snapped
his
chief
so
i
directed
her
how
she
could
get
there
and
wally
found
himself
lifted
from
the
chair
and
hammered
down
into
it
again
his
soft
flesh
quaked
like
a
jelly
as
he
stared
at
the
furious
face
above
him
the
fat
chin
of
the
little
man
drooped
my
god
mac
do
do
that
he
whined
macdonald
wheeled
abruptly
away
crossed
the
room
in
long
strides
and
came
back
he
had
a
grip
on
himself
again
what
the
use
he
said
aloud
you
nothing
but
a
spineless
putterer
have
you
enough
sense
even
to
give
me
a
chance
to
decide
for
myself
why
did
you
keep
the
woman
with
you
till
you
could
send
for
me
you
daft
donkey
i
swear
i
never
thought
of
that
what
have
you
got
up
there
in
your
head
instead
of
brains
i
send
you
outside
to
look
after
things
and
you
fall
down
on
the
job
i
give
you
plain
instructions
what
to
do
at
kamatlah
and
you
let
elliot
make
a
monkey
of
you
you
see
him
on
the
boat
with
a
woman
coming
to
make
trouble
for
me
and
the
best
you
can
do
is
to
help
her
on
the
way
man
man
use
your
gumption
if
i
had
known
d
think
you
got
sense
enough
to
take
a
plain
straight
message
as
far
as
the
hotel
because
if
you
have
i
got
one
to
send
wally
caressed
tenderly
his
bruised
flesh
he
had
a
childlike
desire
to
weep
but
he
was
afraid
macdonald
would
kick
him
out
of
the
office
i
do
whatever
you
say
mac
he
answered
humbly
the
brushed
the
swivel
chair
and
its
occupant
to
one
side
drew
up
another
chair
in
front
of
the
desk
and
faced
selfridge
squarely
the
eyes
that
blazed
at
the
little
man
were
the
grimmest
he
had
ever
looked
into
go
to
the
hotel
and
see
this
man
elliot
alone
tell
him
he
gone
too
far
butted
into
my
affairs
once
too
often
there
not
a
man
alive
stand
it
from
my
orders
are
for
him
to
get
out
on
the
next
boat
if
he
here
after
that
i
kill
him
on
sight
the
color
ebbed
out
of
the
florid
face
of
wally
he
moistened
his
lips
to
speak
good
god
mac
you
ca
do
that
he
go
out
and
report
to
hell
with
his
report
let
him
say
what
he
likes
put
this
to
him
straight
that
he
and
i
ca
stay
in
this
town
both
of
us
wally
had
lapped
up
too
many
highballs
in
the
past
ten
years
to
relish
this
kind
of
a
mission
he
had
depressed
his
nerves
with
overmuch
tobacco
and
spurred
them
with
liquors
had
dissipated
his
force
in
many
small
riotings
his
nerve
was
gone
he
had
not
the
punch
any
more
yet
mac
was
always
expecting
him
to
help
out
with
his
rough
stuff
he
reflected
fretfully
this
was
the
third
time
in
a
month
that
he
had
been
flung
headlong
into
trouble
take
this
message
now
there
was
no
sense
in
it
selfridge
plucked
up
his
courage
to
say
so
that
wo
buy
us
anything
but
trouble
mac
in
the
old
days
you
could
put
over
the
little
man
never
guessed
how
close
he
came
to
being
flung
through
the
transom
over
the
door
but
his
instinct
warned
him
to
stop
his
objection
died
away
in
a
mumble
o
course
i
do
whatever
you
say
he
added
a
second
time
see
you
do
advised
his
chief
an
ugly
look
in
his
eyes
tell
him
he
gets
till
the
next
boat
if
he
here
after
that
he
better
go
heeled
for
i
shoot
on
sight
wherever
we
meet
selfridge
went
on
his
errand
with
lagging
feet
on
the
way
he
stopped
at
the
saloon
to
fortify
himself
with
a
cocktail
he
found
elliot
sitting
moodily
alone
on
the
porch
of
the
hotel
in
gordon
pocket
there
was
a
note
to
macdonald
explaining
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
coming
of
meteetse
he
had
expected
to
send
it
by
the
hotel
porter
that
evening
but
the
curt
order
to
leave
town
filled
him
with
a
chill
anger
the
dictator
of
affairs
at
kusiak
might
think
what
he
pleased
for
all
the
explanation
he
would
get
from
him
as
for
taking
the
next
boat
elliot
did
not
even
give
that
consideration
tell
your
master
i
do
take
orders
from
him
he
told
wally
quietly
i
stay
till
my
work
here
is
done
they
had
moved
a
few
yards
down
the
street
now
gordon
turned
and
active
and
trod
with
crisp
confident
step
back
to
the
hotel
he
had
said
all
that
was
necessary
to
say
two
men
standing
on
the
porch
nodded
a
to
him
gordon
about
to
pass
glanced
at
them
again
they
were
northrup
and
trelawney
two
of
the
miners
who
had
had
trouble
with
macdonald
on
the
boat
on
impulse
he
stopped
found
work
yet
he
asked
found
a
job
and
lost
it
again
northrup
answered
sullenly
too
bad
macdonald
passed
the
word
along
that
we
were
to
get
work
so
our
boss
fired
us
the
whole
district
is
closed
to
us
we
been
blacklisted
explained
trelawney
and
we
busted
added
his
mate
elliot
was
always
perhaps
he
felt
just
now
unusually
sympathetic
towards
these
victims
of
the
methods
of
macdonald
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
small
leather
purse
and
gave
a
piece
of
gold
to
each
of
them
just
as
a
loan
to
carry
you
for
a
couple
of
days
till
you
get
something
to
do
he
suggested
northrup
demurred
but
after
a
little
pressure
accepted
the
accommodation
i
pay
you
soon
back
he
promised
trelawney
laughed
recklessly
he
had
been
drinking
you
bet
me
too
his
companion
flashed
a
look
of
warning
at
him
and
explained
that
they
were
going
down
the
river
to
look
for
work
outside
of
the
district
suddenly
trelawney
broke
loose
and
began
to
curse
macdonald
with
a
bitterness
that
surprised
the
government
agent
what
struck
him
most
though
was
the
obvious
anxiety
of
northrup
to
quiet
his
partner
and
to
gloss
over
what
he
had
said
thinking
of
it
later
gordon
wondered
why
the
dane
who
had
as
much
cause
to
hate
macdonald
as
the
other
should
be
at
such
pains
to
smooth
down
the
man
and
explain
away
his
threats
elliot
bought
an
automatic
revolver
next
morning
and
a
box
of
cartridges
he
was
not
looking
for
trouble
but
he
intended
to
be
prepared
for
it
when
trouble
came
looking
for
him
with
a
rifle
he
was
a
fair
shot
but
he
lacked
experience
with
the
revolver
in
the
afternoon
he
walked
out
of
town
and
practiced
shooting
at
tin
cans
for
a
half
an
hour
on
his
way
back
he
met
peter
paget
the
engineer
came
straight
to
the
subject
in
his
mind
selfridge
came
to
see
me
last
night
he
told
me
about
the
trouble
between
you
and
macdonald
gordon
you
must
leave
town
till
he
cools
down
macdonald
is
a
bad
man
with
a
gat
is
he
you
can
drop
down
the
river
on
business
for
a
few
weeks
after
a
while
his
friend
looked
at
him
coolly
i
can
but
i
not
going
to
where
do
you
get
this
stuff
about
me
being
a
quitter
pete
peter
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
now
look
here
gordon
do
be
a
kid
and
foolhardy
duck
i
your
friend
you
his
too
are
you
yes
of
course
but
all
right
tell
him
to
duck
there
be
no
trouble
of
my
making
but
if
he
starts
any
i
be
there
macdonald
does
own
the
earth
you
know
i
been
sent
up
here
by
uncle
sam
on
business
and
you
can
bet
your
last
dollar
i
stay
on
the
job
till
i
through
of
course
you
got
to
finish
your
job
but
it
does
all
have
to
be
done
right
here
just
for
a
week
or
two
tell
your
friend
something
else
while
you
on
the
subject
if
i
drop
him
i
go
scot
free
because
he
is
interfering
with
me
in
my
duty
put
selfridge
on
the
stand
to
prove
it
but
if
he
should
kill
me
his
last
chance
for
getting
the
macdonald
claims
patented
would
be
gone
the
public
would
raise
such
a
howl
that
the
administration
would
have
to
throw
your
friend
and
the
guttenchilds
overboard
to
save
itself
i
know
that
and
macdonald
knows
it
so
he
stands
to
lose
either
way
paget
knew
this
was
true
he
knew
too
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
with
this
young
athlete
that
jaw
and
salient
chin
did
not
belong
to
a
slacker
gordon
would
stick
and
see
the
thing
out
but
peter
could
not
drop
the
subject
without
one
more
appeal
he
not
sore
at
you
about
the
claims
you
know
that
it
because
you
brought
the
squaw
up
the
river
to
see
sheba
i
did
bring
her
had
a
thing
to
do
with
that
i
do
know
who
brought
her
though
i
could
give
a
good
guess
a
gleam
of
hope
showed
in
the
eye
of
the
engineer
you
did
bring
her
diane
said
you
threatened
maybe
i
did
say
i
would
anyhow
i
thought
better
of
it
but
i
glad
some
one
had
the
sense
to
tell
miss
the
truth
who
do
you
think
brought
her
i
not
thinking
on
that
subject
out
loud
but
if
we
could
show
mac
that
up
to
you
i
not
lift
a
finger
your
king
of
kusiak
has
to
learn
some
time
that
everybody
is
going
to
sidestep
him
and
pussyfoot
when
he
around
i
did
start
this
war
and
i
not
making
any
peace
overtures
you
as
obstinate
as
the
devil
smiled
peter
but
in
his
heart
he
admired
the
dourness
of
his
friend
the
engineer
went
to
macdonald
and
gave
a
deleted
version
of
his
talk
with
elliot
the
scotchman
listened
a
bitter
incredulous
smile
on
his
face
says
he
did
bring
her
does
he
tell
him
from
me
that
he
lies
your
wife
let
out
to
me
by
accident
that
he
threatened
to
bring
her
meteetse
and
he
came
up
on
the
boat
together
he
was
with
her
at
your
house
when
she
told
her
story
he
trying
to
save
his
hide
no
chance
elliot
is
a
liar
when
he
says
he
did
bring
the
woman
that
satisfies
me
i
know
he
did
do
it
insisted
paget
stiffly
different
here
who
else
had
any
interest
in
bringing

next
one

back
too

figure

at
your
house
when
they
showed
up
there
to
tell
the
story
where
elliot
slipped
up
peter
was
of
different
stuff
from
selfridge
he
had
something
to
say
so
he
said
it
times
have
changed
mac
you
ca
shoot
down
this
young
fellow
without
making
all
kinds
of
trouble
first
thing
we
lose
the
claims
the
administration
would
drop
you
like
a
hot
potato
if
you
did
a
thing
like
that
sheba

never
speak

friends

hearts

do
it
macdonald
jaw
clamped
then
let
him
get
out
that
my
last
word
to
him
chapter
xvi
ambushed
colby
macdonald
in
miner
boots
and
corduroy
working
suit
stood
beside
his
horse
with
one
arm
thrown
carelessly
across
its
rump
he
was
about
to
start
for
creek
camp
with
hundred
dollars
in
the
saddlebags
to
pay
the
men
there
diane
was
talking
with
him
she
young
and
fine
and
spirited
of
course
it
was
a
great
shock
to
her
she
had
been
idealizing
you
but
i
think
she
is
beginning
to
understand
things
better
at
any
rate
she
does
not
hate
you
any
more
give
the
girl
time
you
think
she
will
be
reasonable
paget
finished
the
pattern
she
was
punching
in
the
soft
ground
beside
the
board
walk
with
the
ferrule
of
her
umbrella
her
eyes
met
his
frankly
i
do
know
but
i
sure
of
one
thing
she
not
be
reasonable
as
you
call
it
unless
you
are
reasonable
you
mean
elliot
yes
she
likes
him
very
much
do
you
know
that
when
the
indian
woman
came
he
urged
sheba
not
to
listen
to
her
story
sounds
likely
after
he
had
spent
his
good
money
bringing
her
here
sneered
the
he
did
gordon
is
a
splendid
fellow
he
would
lie
answered
diane
hotly
and
one
thing
is
sure
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
him
for
this
it
will
be
fatal
with
sheba
she
will
be
through
with
you
macdonald
had
thought
of
this
before
it
had
been
coming
to
him
from
several
different
angles
that
he
could
not
afford
to
gratify
his
desire
to
wipe
this
meddlesome
young
official
from
his
path
he
made
a
slow
sulky
promise
all
right
i
let
him
alone
peter
can
tell
him
swinging
to
the
saddle
he
spurred
his
horse
and
cantered
away
with
a
little
smile
diane
watched
his
flat
muscular
back
and
the
arrogant
set
of
his
strong
shoulders
there
was
not
his
match
in
the
territory
she
thought
but
sometimes
a
clever
woman
could
manage
him
his
mind
was
full
of
the
problem
that
had
come
into
his
life
he
rode
abstractedly
so
that
he
was
at
the
lower
ford
of
the
creek
almost
before
he
knew
it
a
bilberry
thicket
straggled
down
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
on
both
sides
of
the
road
the
horse
splashed
through
the
ford
and
took
the
little
rise
beyond
with
a
rush
just
before
reaching
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
animal
stumbled
and
fell
as
its
rider
went
headlong
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
cord
drawn
taut
across
the
path
macdonald
shaken
by
the
fall
began
slowly
to
rise
from
the
shadows
of
the
bilberry
bushes
two
stooping
figures
rushed
at
him
he
threw
up
an
arm
to
ward
off
the
club
aimed
at
his
head
but
succeeded
only
in
breaking
the
force
of
the
blow
as
he
staggered
back
stunned
a
bullet
glanced
along
his
forehead
and
ridged
a
furrow
through
the
thick
hair
a
second
stroke
of
the
club
jarred
him
to
the
heels
though
his
mind
was
not
clear
his
body
answered
automatically
the
instinct
that
told
him
to
close
with
his
assailants
he
lurched
forward
and
gripped
one
wrestling
with
him
for
the
revolver
vaguely
he
knew
by
the
sharp
jagged
shoots
of
pain
that
the
second
man
was
beating
his
head
with
a
club
the
warm
blood
dripped
through
his
hair
and
blinded
his
eyes
dazed
and
shaken
he
yet
managed
to
get
the
revolver
from
the
man
who
had
it
but
it
was
his
last
effort
he
was
too
far
gone
to
use
it
a
blow
on
the
forehead
brought
him
unconscious
to
the
ground
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds
on
his
way
back
from
creek
camp
gordon
elliot
rode
down
to
the
ford
in
the
dusk
he
was
almost
upon
them
before
the
robbers
heard
him
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
gazing
at
him
and
he
at
the
tragedy
before
him
one
of
the
men
moved
toward
his
horse
stop
there
ordered
gordon
sharply
and
he
reached
for
his
revolver
the
man
it
was
the
miner
northrup
jumped
for
elliot
and
the
field
agent
fired
another
moment
and
he
was
being
dragged
from
the
saddle
what
happened
next
was
never
clear
to
him
he
knew
that
both
of
the
bandits
closed
in
on
him
and
that
he
was
fighting
desperately
against
odds
the
revolver
had
been
knocked
from
his
hand
and
he
fought
with
bare
fists
just
as
they
did
twice
he
emptied
his
lungs
in
a
cry
for
help
they
quartered
over
the
ground
for
gordon
would
not
let
either
of
them
get
behind
him
they
were
larger
than
he
heavy
giants
of
great
strength
but
he
was
far
more
active
on
his
feet
he
jabbed
and
sidestepped
and
retreated
more
than
once
their
heavy
blows
crashed
home
on
his
face
his
eyes
dared
not
wander
from
them
for
an
instant
but
he
was
working
toward
a
definite
plan
as
he
moved
his
feet
were
searching
for
the
automatic
he
had
dropped
one
of
his
feet
dragging
over
the
ground
came
into
contact
with
the
steel
with
a
swift
side
kick
gordon
flung
the
weapon
a
dozen
feet
to
the
left
presently
watching
his
chance
he
made
a
dive
for
it
trelawney
followed
by
northrup
turned
and
ran
one
of
them
caught
macdonald
horse
by
the
bridle
he
swung
to
the
saddle
and
the
other
man
clambered
on
behind
there
was
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
they
were
gone
elliot
stooped
over
the
battered
body
that
lay
huddled
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
man
was
either
dead
or
unconscious
he
was
not
sure
which
so
badly
had
the
face
been
beaten
and
hammered
that
it
was
not
until
he
had
washed
the
blood
from
the
wounds
that
gordon
recognized
macdonald
opening
the
coat
of
the
insensible
man
gordon
put
his
hand
against
the
heart
he
could
not
be
sure
whether
he
felt
it
beating
or
whether
the
throbbing
came
from
the
pulses
in
his
finger
tips
as
well
as
he
could
he
bound
up
the
wounds
with
handkerchiefs
and
stanched
the
bleeding
with
water
from
the
stream
he
drenched
the
bruised
face
a
faint
sigh
quivered
through
the
slack
inert
body
gordon
hoisted
macdonald
across
the
saddle
and
led
the
horse
through
the
ford
he
walked
beside
the
animal
to
town
and
never
had
two
miles
seemed
to
him
so
far
with
one
hand
he
steadied
the
helpless
body
that
lay
like
a
sack
of
flour
balanced
in
the
trough
of
the
saddle
kusiak
at
last
lay
below
him
and
when
he
descended
the
hill
to
the
suburbs
almost
the
first
house
was
the
one
where
the
pagets
lived
elliot
threw
the
body
across
his
shoulder
and
walked
up
the
walk
to
the
porch
he
kicked
upon
the
door
with
his
foot
sheba
answered
the
knock
and
at
sight
of
what
he
carried
the
color
faded
from
her
face
macdonald
has
been
hurt
badly
he
explained
quickly
this
way
the
girl
cried
and
led
him
to
her
own
room
hurrying
in
advance
to
throw
back
the
bedclothes
get
diane
and
a
doctor
ordered
gordon
after
he
had
laid
the
unconscious
man
on
the
white
sheet
while
he
and
diane
undressed
the
sheba
got
a
doctor
on
the
telephone
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
after
a
long
time
but
there
was
in
them
the
glaze
of
delirium
he
recognized
none
of
them
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
in
the
house
of
peter
paget
that
diane
and
sheba
and
his
rival
were
fighting
with
the
help
of
the
doctor
to
push
back
the
death
that
was
crowding
close
upon
him
all
night
he
raved
and
his
delirious
talk
went
back
to
the
wild
scenes
of
his
earlier
life
sometimes
he
swore
savagely
again
he
made
quiet
deadly
threats
but
always
his
talk
was
crisp
and
clean
and
vigorous
nothing
foul
or
slimy
came
to
the
surface
in
those
hours
of
unconscious
babbling
the
doctor
had
shaken
his
head
when
he
first
saw
the
wounds
he
would
make
no
promises
he
a
mighty
sick
man
the
cuts
are
deep
and
the
hammering
must
have
jarred
his
brain
terribly
if
it
was
anybody
but
macdonald
i
give
him
a
chance
he
told
diane
when
he
left
in
the
morning
to
get
breakfast
but
macdonald
has
tremendous
vitality
of
course
if
he
lives
it
will
be
because
elliot
brought
him
in
so
soon
gordon
walked
with
the
doctor
as
far
as
the
hotel
a
brown
thin
leathery
man
undraped
himself
from
a
chair
in
the
lobby
when
elliot
opened
the
door
he
was
officially
known
as
the
chief
of
police
of
kusiak
incidentally
he
constituted
the
whole
police
force
generally
he
was
referred
to
as
gopher
jones
on
account
of
his
habit
of
spasmodic
prospecting
i
got
to
put
you
under
arrest
elliot
he
explained
the
loafers
in
the
hotel
drew
closer
what
for
demanded
gordon
surprised
doc
thinks
it
will
run
to
murder
i
reckon
the
field
agent
was
startled
you
mean
macdonald
the
brown
man
chewed
his
quid
steadily
you
done
guessed
it
that
absurd
you
know
what
evidence
have
you
got
first
off
you
had
trouble
with
him
it
was
common
talk
that
when
you
and
mac
met
guns
were
going
to
pop
you
bought
an
automatic
revolver
at
the
seattle
kusiak
emporium
two
days
ago
you
was
seen
practising
with
it
he
had
threatened
me
you
want
to
be
careful
what
you
say
elliot
it
will
be
used
against
you
gopher
shot
a
squirt
of
tobacco
unerringly
at
the
open
door
of
the
stove
you
was
seen
talking
with
trelawney
and
northrup
money
passed
from
you
to
them
i
gave
them
a
loan
of
ten
dollars
each
because
they
were
broke
is
that
criminal
demanded
gordon
angrily
that
your
story
you
git
a
chance
to
tell
it
to
the
jury
i
should
wonder
mebbe
they
believe
it
you
never
can
tell
believe
it
why
you
muttonhead
i
found
him
where
he
was
bleeding
to
death
and
brought
him
in
that
what
i
heard
say
kinder
queer
ai
it
you
happened
to
be
the
man
that
found
him
nothing
queer
about
it
i
was
riding
in
from
creek
camp
gordon
was
exasperated
but
not
at
all
alarmed
so
you
was
while
you
was
out
at
the
camp
you
asked
one
of
the
boys
how
big
the
would
be
does
that
prove
i
was
planning
a
is
that
the
last
thing
i
would
have
asked
if
i
had
intended
robbery
do
ask
me
i
ai
no
psychologist
all
i
know
is
you
took
an
interest
in
the
on
the
way
i
here
for
the
government
investigating
macdonald
i
was
getting
information
earning
my
pay
can
you
understand
that
gopher
chewed
his
cud
impassively
sure
i
can
and
i
been
earning
mine
by
the
way
howcome
you
to
be
beat
up
so
bad
mr
elliot
i
had
a
fight
with
the
robbers
sure
it
was
with
the
robbed
that
split
lip
of
yours
looks
to
me
plumb
like
mac
john
hancock
elliot
flushed
angrily
of
course
if
you
intend
to
believe
me
guilty
now
there
ai
no
manner
o
use
in
gettin
het
up
young
fellow
mebbe
you
did
it
mebbe
you
did
anyhow
you
gim
me
that
gat
you
been
toting
these
last
few
days
gordon
hand
moved
toward
his
hip
then
he
remembered
i
have
it
i
left
it
you
left
it
at
the
ford
with
one
shell
empty
that
where
you
left
it
interrupted
the
officer
yes
i
fired
at
northrup
as
he
rushed
me
assented
jones
impudent
unbelief
in
his
eye
at
northrup
or
at
macdonald
what
do
you
think
i
did
with
the
money
then
did
i
eat
it
not
so
you
could
notice
it
since
you
put
it
to
me
you
gave
it
to
your
pardners
you
did
want
it
they
did
they
have
got
the
horse
too
and
they
hitting
the
high
spots
to
make
their
elliot
was
locked
up
in
the
flimsy
jail
without
breakfast
he
was
furious
but
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
narrow
beat
beside
the
bed
his
anger
gave
way
to
anxiety
surely
the
pagets
could
not
believe
he
had
done
such
a
thing
and
sheba
would
she
accept
as
true
this
weight
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
was
piling
up
against
him
it
could
all
be
explained
so
easily
and
yet
the
facts
fitted
like
links
of
a
chain
to
condemn
him
he
went
over
them
one
by
one
the
babbling
tongue
of
selfridge
that
had
made
common
gossip
of
the
impending
tragedy
in
which
he
and
macdonald
were
the
principals
his
purchase
of
the
automatic
his
public
meeting
with
two
known
enemies
of
the
scotchman
during
which
he
had
been
seen
to
give
them
money
his
target
practice
with
the
new
revolver
the
unhappy
chance
that
had
taken
him
out
to
creek
camp
the
very
day
of
the
robbery
his
casual
questions
of
the
miners
even
the
finding
of
the
body
by
him
all
of
these
dovetailed
with
the
hypothesis
that
his
partners
in
crime
were
to
escape
and
bear
the
blame
while
he
was
to
bring
the
body
back
to
town
and
assume
innocence
paget
was
admitted
to
his
cell
later
in
the
morning
by
gopher
jones
he
shook
hands
with
the
prisoner
jones
retired
tough
luck
gordon
the
engineer
said
what
does
sheba
think
asked
the
young
man
quickly
we
have
told
her
you
have
been
arrested
i
heard
it
only
a
little
while
ago
and
diane
yes
she
knows
well
demanded
gordon
brusquely
peter
looked
at
him
in
questioning
surprise
well
what
he
caught
the
meaning
of
his
friend
try
not
to
be
an
ass
gordon
of
course
she
knows
the
charge
is
ridiculous
the
chip
dropped
from
the
young
man
shoulder
good
old
diane
i
might
have
known
he
said
with
a
new
cheerfulness
i
think
you
might
have
agreed
peter
dryly
by
the
way
have
you
had
any
breakfast
no
i
hungry
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
something
sent
in
from
the
hotel
how
macdonald
he
alive
and
while
there
life
there
is
hope
any
news
of
the
murderers
asked
gordon
posses
are
combing
the
hills
for
them
they
stole
a
packhorse
from
a
truck
gardener
up
the
valley
it
seems
they
bought
an
outfit
for
a
month
yesterday
said
they
were
going
prospecting
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
longer
mainly
on
the
question
of
a
lawyer
and
the
chances
of
getting
out
on
bond
peter
left
the
prisoner
in
very
much
better
spirits
than
he
had
found
him
chapter
xvii
god
save
you
kindly
a
nurse
from
the
hospital
had
relieved
diane
and
sheba
at
daybreak
they
slept
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
then
under
orders
from
the
doctor
walked
out
to
take
the
air
they
were
to
divide
the
night
watch
between
them
and
he
said
that
he
wanted
them
fit
for
service
the
fever
of
the
patient
was
subsiding
he
slept
a
good
deal
and
in
the
intervals
between
had
been
once
or
twice
quite
rational
the
thoughts
of
the
cousins
drew
their
steps
toward
the
jail
sheba
looked
at
diane
will
they
let
us
see
him
do
you
think
perhaps
we
can
try
gopher
jones
was
not
proof
against
the
brisk
confidence
with
which
paget
demanded
admittance
he
stroked
his
unshaven
chin
while
he
chewed
his
quid
then
reluctantly
got
his
keys
the
prisoner
was
sitting
on
the
bed
his
heart
jumped
with
gladness
when
he
looked
up
diane
shook
hands
cheerfully
how
is
the
criminal
better
for
hearing
your
kind
voice
he
answered
his
eyes
strayed
to
the
girl
in
the
background
they
met
a
troubled
smile
grave
and
sweet
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
he
told
sheba
gratefully
how
is
macdonald
better
we
hope
he
knew
diane
this
afternoon
paget
did
most
of
the
talking
but
gordon
contributed
his
share
sheba
did
not
say
much
but
it
seemed
to
the
young
man
that
there
was
a
new
tenderness
in
her
manner
the
expression
of
a
gentle
kindness
that
went
out
to
him
because
he
needed
it
the
walk
had
whipped
the
color
into
her
cheeks
and
she
bloomed
in
that
squalid
cell
like
a
desert
rose
there
was
in
the
fluent
grace
of
the
slender
young
body
a
naïve
virginal
sweetness
that
took
him
by
the
throat
he
knew
that
she
believed
in
him
and
the
trouble
rolled
from
his
heart
like
a
cold
heavy
wave
we
have
talked
to
macdonald
yet
about
the
attack
on
him
diane
explained
but
he
must
have
recognized
the
men
there
are
many
footprints
at
the
ford
showing
how
they
moved
over
the
ground
as
they
fought
so
he
could
not
have
been
unconscious
from
the
first
blow
unless
they
were
masked
he
must
have
known
them
it
was
light
enough
agreed
elliot
peter
is
still
trying
to
get
the
officers
to
accept
bail
but
i
think
he
will
succeed
there
is
a
good
deal
of
feeling
in
town
against
you
because
i
am
supposed
to
be
an
enemy
to
an
open
alaska
i
judge
mainly
that
wally
selfridge
has
been
talking
a
good
deal
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
you
are
guilty
we
have
to
wait
in
patience
till
macdonald
speaks
and
clears
you
the
doctor
wo
let
us
mention
the
subject
to
him
until
he
comes
to
it
of
his
own
free
will
gopher
stuck
his
head
in
at
the
door
you
have
to
go
ladies
up
when
sheba
bade
the
prisoner
it
was
with
a
phrase
of
the
old
irish
vernacular
god
save
you
kindly
he
knew
the
peasant
answer
to
the
wish
and
gave
it
and
you
too
the
girl
left
the
prison
with
a
mist
in
her
eyes
her
cousin
looked
at
her
with
a
queer
ironic
little
smile
of
affection
to
be
in
trouble
was
a
sure
passport
to
the
sympathy
of
sheba
now
both
her
lovers
were
in
a
sad
way
diane
wondered
which
of
them
would
gain
most
from
this
new
twist
of
fate
sheba
turned
to
paget
with
an
impulsive
little
burst
of
feminine
ferocity
why
do
they
put
him
in
prison
when
they
must
know
he
do
it
that
he
could
do
such
a
thing
they
do
all
know
as
well
as
you
do
how
noble
he
is
my
dear
answered
diane
dryly
but
it
just
absurd
to
think
that
he
would
plan
the
murder
of
a
man
he
has
broken
bread
with
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
diane
flashed
another
odd
little
glance
in
the
direction
of
her
cousin
probably
sheba
was
the
one
woman
in
kusiak
who
did
not
know
that
macdonald
had
served
an
ultimatum
on
elliot
to
get
out
or
fight
and
that
their
rivalry
over
her
favor
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
difficulty
between
them
it
will
work
out
all
right
promised
the
older
cousin
returning
from
their
walk
they
met
wally
selfridge
coming
out
of
the
paget
house
did
you
see
mr
macdonald
asked
diane
yes
he
quite
rational
now
there
was
a
jaunty
little
strut
of
triumph
in
wally
manner
paget
knew
he
had
made
himself
very
busy
securing
evidence
against
gordon
he
was
probably
trying
to
curry
favor
with
his
chief
the
little
man
always
had
been
jealous
of
peter
perhaps
he
was
attempting
to
rap
him
over
the
shoulder
of
elliot
because
the
government
official
was
a
friend
of
paget
just
now
his
insolent
voice
suggested
a
special
cause
for
exultation
the
reason
wally
was
so
pleased
with
himself
was
that
he
had
dropped
a
hint
into
the
ear
of
the
wounded
man
not
to
clear
elliot
of
complicity
in
the
attack
upon
him
the
news
that
the
special
investigator
had
been
arrested
for
robbery
and
attempted
murder
flashed
all
over
the
united
states
would
go
far
to
neutralize
any
report
he
might
make
against
the
validity
of
the
macdonald
claims
if
to
this
could
be
added
later
reports
of
an
indictment
a
trial
and
possibly
a
conviction
it
would
not
matter
two
straws
what
elliot
said
in
his
official
statement
to
the
land
office
since
the
attack
upon
his
chief
selfridge
had
moved
on
the
presumption
that
elliot
had
been
in
a
conspiracy
to
get
rid
of
him
he
accepted
the
guilt
of
the
field
agent
because
this
theory
jumped
with
the
interest
of
wally
and
his
friends
as
a
politician
he
intended
to
play
this
new
development
for
all
it
was
worth
he
had
been
shocked
at
the
sight
of
macdonald
the
terrible
beating
and
the
loss
of
blood
had
sapped
all
the
splendid
vital
strength
of
the
scotchman
his
battered
head
was
swathed
in
bandages
but
the
white
face
was
bruised
and
disfigured
the
wounded
man
was
weak
as
a
kitten
only
the
steady
eyes
told
that
he
was
still
strong
and
unconquered
i
want
to
talk
business
for
a
minute
miss
sedgwick
will
you
please
step
out
said
macdonald
to
his
nurse
she
hesitated
the
doctor
says
do
as
i
say
please
the
nurse
left
them
alone
wally
told
the
story
of
the
evidence
against
elliot
in
four
sentences
his
chief
caught
the
point
at
once
after
selfridge
had
gone
the
wounded
man
lay
silent
thinking
out
his
programme
not
for
a
moment
did
he
doubt
that
he
was
going
to
live
and
his
brain
was
already
busy
planning
for
the
future
by
some
freak
of
luck
the
cards
had
been
stacked
by
destiny
in
his
favor
he
knew
now
that
in
the
violence
of
his
anger
against
elliot
he
had
made
a
mistake
to
have
killed
his
rival
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
kamatlah
coal
claims
would
have
alienated
his
best
friends
and
would
have
prejudiced
hopelessly
his
chances
with
sheba
fate
had
been
kind
to
him
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
it
had
put
him
in
the
right
by
the
same
cut
of
the
cards
young
elliot
had
been
thrust
down
from
an
impregnable
position
to
one
in
which
he
was
a
discredited
suspect
with
all
this
evidence
to
show
that
he
had
conspired
against
macdonald
his
report
to
the
department
would
be
labor
lost
diane
came
into
the
stripping
her
gloves
after
the
walk
macdonald
smiled
feebly
at
her
and
fired
the
first
shot
of
his
campaign
to
defeat
the
enemy
has
elliot
been
captured
yet
he
asked
weakly
the
keen
eyes
of
his
hostess
fastened
upon
him
captured
what
do
you
mean
it
was
gordon
elliot
that
brought
you
in
and
saved
your
life
brought
me
from
where
from
where
he
found
you
unconscious
at
the
ford
that
his
story
is
it
macdonald
shut
his
eyes
wearily
but
his
incredulous
voice
had
suggested
a
world
of
innuendo
the
young
woman
stood
with
her
gloves
crushed
tight
in
both
hands
it
was
her
nature
to
be
always
a
partisan
without
any
reserve
she
was
for
gordon
in
this
new
fight
upon
him
what
had
wally
selfridge
been
saying
to
macdonald
she
longed
mightily
to
ask
the
sick
man
some
questions
but
the
orders
of
the
doctor
were
explicit
did
the
mean
to
suggest
that
he
had
identified
elliot
as
one
of
his
assailants
the
thing
was
preposterous
and
yet
that
was
plainly
what
he
had
meant
to
imply
if
he
told
such
a
story
things
would
go
hard
with
gordon
in
court
it
would
clinch
the
case
against
him
by
supplying
the
one
missing
link
in
the
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
diane
in
deep
thought
frowned
down
upon
the
wounded
man
who
seemed
already
to
have
fallen
into
a
light
sleep
she
told
herself
that
this
was
some
of
wally
selfridge
deviltry
anyhow
she
would
talk
it
over
with
peter
chapter
xviii
gordon
spends
a
busy
evening
paget
smoked
placidly
but
the
heart
within
him
was
troubled
it
looked
as
if
selfridge
had
made
up
his
mind
to
frame
gordon
for
a
prison
sentence
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
need
not
invent
any
evidence
or
take
any
chances
if
macdonald
came
through
on
the
stand
with
an
identification
of
elliot
as
one
of
his
assailants
the
young
man
would
go
down
the
river
to
serve
time
there
was
enough
corroborative
testimony
to
convict
peter
himself
it
all
rested
with
macdonald
and
the
big
was
a
very
uncertain
quantity
his
whole
interests
were
at
one
in
favor
of
getting
elliot
out
of
the
way
on
the
other
hand
how
far
would
he
go
to
save
the
kamatlah
claims
and
to
remove
this
rival
from
his
path
peter
could
not
think
he
would
stoop
to
perjury
against
an
innocent
man
i
just
telling
you
what
he
said
diane
explained
and
it
worried
me
his
smile
was
cynical
i
could
help
thinking
that
if
he
wants
to
get
even
with
gordon
paget
stopped
the
maid
had
just
brought
into
the
room
a
visitor
diane
moved
forward
and
shook
hands
with
him
how
do
you
do
strong
take
this
big
chair
hanford
strong
accepted
the
chair
and
a
cigar
though
a
he
wore
as
always
the
rough
clothes
of
a
prospector
he
came
promptly
to
the
object
of
his
call
i
do
know
whether
this
is
where
i
should
have
come
or
not
are
you
folks
for
young
elliot
or
are
you
for
selfridge
he
demanded
if
you
put
it
that
way
we
for
elliot
smiled
peter
all
right
let
me
put
it
another
way
you
work
for
mac
are
you
on
his
side
or
on
elliot
in
this
matter
of
the
coal
claims
diane
looked
at
peter
he
took
his
time
to
answer
we
hope
the
coal
claimants
will
win
but
we
got
sense
enough
to
see
that
gordon
is
in
here
to
report
the
facts
that
what
he
is
paid
for
he
tell
the
truth
as
he
sees
it
if
his
superior
officers
decide
on
those
facts
against
macdonald
i
do
see
that
elliot
is
to
blame
that
how
it
looks
to
me
agreed
strong
i
for
a
alaska
but
that
do
make
it
right
to
put
this
young
fellow
through
for
a
crime
he
did
do
lots
of
folks
think
he
did
it
that
all
right
i
know
he
did
fact
is
i
like
him
he
square
so
i
come
to
tell
you
something
he
smoked
for
a
minute
silently
before
he
continued
i
got
no
evidence
in
his
favor
but
i
bumped
into
something
a
little
while
ago
that
did
look
good
to
me
you
know
i
room
next
him
at
the
hotel
i
heard
a
noise
in
his
room
and
i
thought
that
was
funny
seeing
as
he
was
locked
up
in
jail
so
i
kinder
listened
and
heard
whispers
and
the
sound
of
some
one
moving
about
there
a
door
between
his
room
and
mine
that
is
kept
locked
i
looked
through
the
keyhole
and
in
room
there
was
wally
selfridge
and
another
man
they
were
looking
through
papers
at
the
desk
wally
put
a
stack
of
them
in
his
pocket
and
they
went
out
locking
the
door
behind
them
they
had
no
business
doing
that
burst
out
diane
wally
selfridge
is
an
officer
of
the
law
strong
nodded
dryly
to
her
just
what
i
thought
so
i
followed
them
they
went
to
macdonald
offices
after
awhile
wally
came
out
and
left
the
other
man
there
then
presently
the
lights
went
out
the
man
is
camped
there
for
the
night
will
you
tell
me
why
why
repeated
diane
with
her
sharp
eyes
on
the
miner
because
wally
has
some
papers
there
he
do
want
to
get
away
from
him
some
of
gordon
papers
of
course
you
said
it
all
his
notes
and
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
coal
claims
probably
contributed
peter
maybe
wally
has
stole
them
but
he
has
nerve
enough
to
burn
them
till
he
gets
orders
from
mac
so
he
holding
them
safe
at
the
office
guessed
strong
it
an
outrage
diane
decided
promptly
surest
thing
you
know
wally
has
fixed
it
to
frame
him
for
prison
and
to
play
safe
about
his
evidence
on
the
coal
claims
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
diane
asked
her
husband
sharply
peter
rose
first
i
going
to
see
gordon
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
come
on
strong
we
may
be
gone
quite
a
while
diane
do
wait
up
for
me
if
you
get
through
your
stint
of
nursing
roused
from
sleep
gopher
jones
grumbled
a
good
deal
about
letting
the
men
see
his
prisoner
you
got
all
day
ai
you
without
traipsing
around
here
nights
do
you
figure
i
entitled
to
any
rest
but
he
let
them
into
the
ramshackle
building
that
served
as
a
jail
and
after
three
dollars
had
jingled
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
stepped
outside
and
left
the
men
alone
with
his
prisoner
the
three
put
their
heads
together
and
whispered
i
meet
you
outside
the
house
of
selfridge
in
half
an
hour
strong
was
the
last
thing
that
gordon
said
before
jones
came
back
to
order
out
the
visitors
as
soon
as
the
place
was
dark
again
gordon
set
to
work
on
the
flimsy
framework
of
his
cell
window
he
knew
already
it
was
so
decrepit
that
he
could
escape
any
time
he
desired
but
until
now
there
had
been
no
reason
why
he
should
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
lifted
the
sash
bodily
from
the
frame
and
crawled
through
the
window
he
found
paget
and
strong
waiting
for
him
in
the
shadows
of
a
pine
outside
the
yard
of
selfridge
to
begin
with
you
walk
straight
home
and
go
to
bed
peter
the
young
man
announced
you
not
in
this
you
not
invited
to
our
party
i
do
have
to
tell
you
why
do
i
the
engineer
understood
the
reason
he
was
an
employee
of
macdonald
a
man
thoroughly
trusted
by
him
even
though
gordon
intended
only
to
right
a
wrong
it
was
better
that
paget
should
not
be
a
party
to
it
reluctantly
peter
went
home
gordon
turned
to
strong
i
owe
you
a
lot
already
there
no
need
for
you
to
run
a
risk
of
getting
into
trouble
for
me
if
things
break
right
i
can
do
what
i
have
to
do
without
help
and
if
they
do
strong
waved
an
impatient
hand
cut
it
out
elliot
i
taken
a
fancy
to
go
through
with
this
i
never
did
like
selfridge
anyhow
and
i
ai
got
a
wife
and
i
do
work
for
mac
why
the
hell
should
i
have
some
fun
gordon
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
right
might
as
well
play
ball
and
get
things
moving
then
the
little
miner
knocked
at
the
door
wally
himself
opened
elliot
from
the
shelter
of
the
pine
saw
the
two
men
in
talk
selfridge
shut
the
door
and
came
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
he
gave
a
gasp
and
his
hands
went
trembling
into
the
air
the
of
the
miner
had
been
pressed
hard
against
his
fat
paunch
under
curt
orders
he
moved
down
the
steps
and
out
of
the
yard
to
the
tree
at
sight
of
gordon
the
eyes
of
wally
stood
out
in
amazement
little
sweat
beads
burst
out
on
his
forehead
for
he
remembered
how
busy
he
had
been
collecting
evidence
against
this
man
do
you
want
he
asked
got
your
keys
with
you
come
with
us
wally
breathed
more
freely
for
a
moment
he
had
thought
this
man
had
come
to
take
summary
vengeance
on
him
they
led
him
by
alleys
and
back
streets
to
the
office
of
the
macdonald
yukon
trading
company
under
orders
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
called
out
who
he
was
gordon
crouched
close
to
the
log
wall
strong
behind
him
let
me
in
olson
ordered
selfridge
again
the
door
opened
and
a
man
stood
on
the
threshold
elliot
was
on
top
of
him
like
a
panther
the
man
went
down
as
though
his
knees
were
oiled
hinges
before
he
could
gather
his
slow
wits
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
was
shoved
against
his
teeth
take
it
easy
olson
advised
gordon
get
up
slowly
now
step
back
into
the
office
keep
your
hands
up
strong
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
i
want
my
papers
selfridge
dig
up
your
keys
and
get
them
for
me
elliot
commanded
wally
did
not
need
any
keys
he
knew
the
combination
of
the
safe
and
opened
it
from
an
inner
drawer
he
drew
a
bunch
of
papers
gordon
looked
them
over
carefully
strong
sat
on
a
table
and
toyed
with
a
revolver
which
he
jammed
playfully
into
the
stomach
of
his
fat
prisoner
all
here
announced
the
field
agent
the
locked
their
prisoners
in
the
office
and
disappeared
into
the
night
they
stopped
at
the
house
of
the
collector
of
customs
a
genial
young
fellow
with
whom
elliot
had
played
tennis
a
good
deal
and
left
the
papers
in
his
hands
for
after
which
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
reached
the
second
floor
by
way
of
the
back
stairs
used
by
the
servants
here
they
parted
each
going
to
his
own
room
gordon
slept
like
a
schoolboy
and
woke
only
when
the
sun
poured
through
the
window
upon
his
bed
in
a
broad
ribbon
of
warm
gold
he
got
up
bathed
dressed
and
went
down
into
the
hotel
the
waiters
looked
at
him
in
amazement
presently
the
cook
peered
in
at
him
from
the
kitchen
and
the
clerk
made
an
excuse
to
drop
into
the
room
gordon
ate
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
apparently
unaware
of
the
excitement
he
was
causing
he
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
the
nudging
and
the
whispering
after
he
had
finished
breakfast
he
lit
a
cigar
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
placidly
presently
an
eruption
of
men
poured
into
the
room
at
the
head
of
them
was
gopher
jones
near
the
rear
wally
selfridge
lingered
modestly
he
was
not
looking
for
hazardous
adventure
whad
you
doing
here
demanded
gopher
bristling
up
to
elliot
the
young
man
watched
a
smoke
wreath
float
ceilingward
before
he
turned
his
mild
gaze
on
the
chief
of
police
i
smoking
do
you
know
we
just
got
in
from
hunting
you
two
posses
of
us
been
out
all
night
gopher
glared
savagely
at
the
smoker
gordon
looked
distressed
that
too
bad
there
a
telephone
in
my
room
too
why
did
you
call
up
i
been
there
all
night
the
deuce
you
have
exploded
jones
and
us
combing
the
hills
for
you
young
man
you
mighty
smart
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
pay
for
this
did
you
want
me
for
anything
in
particular
or
just
to
get
up
a
poker
game
asked
elliot
suavely
the
leader
of
the
posse
gave
himself
to
a
job
of
scientific
profanity
he
was
spurred
on
to
outdo
himself
because
he
had
heard
a
titter
or
two
behind
him
when
he
had
finished
he
formed
a
procession
he
with
elliot
beside
him
was
at
the
head
of
it
it
marched
to
the
jail
chapter
xix
sheba
does
not
think
so
the
fingers
of
sheba
were
busy
with
the
embroidery
upon
which
she
worked
but
her
thoughts
were
full
of
the
man
who
lay
asleep
on
the
lounge
his
strong
body
lay
at
ease
relaxed
already
health
was
flowing
back
into
his
veins
beneath
the
tan
of
the
lean
muscular
cheeks
a
warmer
color
was
beginning
to
creep
soon
he
would
be
about
again
vigorous
and
forceful
striding
over
obstacles
to
the
goal
he
had
set
himself
just
now
she
was
the
chief
goal
of
his
desire
sheba
did
not
deceive
herself
into
thinking
that
he
had
for
a
moment
accepted
her
dismissal
of
him
he
still
meant
to
marry
her
and
he
had
told
her
so
in
characteristic
way
the
day
after
their
break
sheba
had
sent
him
a
check
for
the
amount
he
had
paid
her
and
had
refused
to
see
him
or
anybody
else
shamed
and
humiliated
she
had
kept
to
her
room
the
check
had
come
back
to
her
by
mail
across
the
face
of
it
he
had
written
in
his
strong
handwriting
i
do
welsh
on
my
bets
you
ca
give
to
me
what
is
not
mine
do
not
think
for
an
instant
that
i
shall
not
marry
you
watching
him
now
she
wondered
what
manner
of
man
he
was
there
had
been
a
day
or
two
when
she
had
thought
she
understood
him
then
she
had
learned
from
the
story
of
meteetse
how
far
his
world
of
thought
was
from
hers
that
which
to
her
had
put
a
gulf
between
them
was
to
him
only
an
incident
she
moved
to
adjust
a
window
blind
and
when
she
returned
found
that
his
steady
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
you
getting
better
fast
she
said
yes
the
girl
had
a
favor
to
ask
of
him
and
lest
her
courage
fail
she
plunged
into
it
macdonald
if
you
say
the
word
elliot
will
be
released
on
bail
i
am
thinking
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
say
it
his
narrowed
eyes
held
a
cold
glitter
why
you
must
know
he
is
innocent
you
must
i
know
only
what
the
evidence
shows
he
cut
in
warily
on
his
guard
he
may
or
may
not
have
been
one
of
my
attackers
from
the
first
blow
i
was
dazed
but
everything
points
to
it
that
he
hired
oh
no
interrupted
the
irish
girl
her
dark
eyes
shining
softly
the
way
of
it
is
that
he
saved
your
life
that
he
fought
for
you
and
that
he
is
in
prison
because
of
it
if
that
is
true
why
does
he
bring
some
proof
of
it
proof
she
cried
scornfully
between
friends
he
no
friend
of
mine
the
man
is
a
meddler
i
despise
him
the
scarlet
flooded
her
cheeks
and
i
am
liking
him
very
very
much
she
flung
back
stanchly
macdonald
looked
up
at
the
vivid
flushed
face
and
found
it
wholly
charming
he
liked
her
none
the
less
because
her
fine
eyes
were
hot
and
defiant
in
behalf
of
his
rival
very
well
he
smiled
i
get
him
out
if
you
do
me
a
good
turn
too
thank
you
it
a
bargain
then
sing
to
me
she
moved
to
the
piano
what
shall
i
sing
sing
the
long
lashes
veiled
her
soft
eyes
while
she
considered
in
a
way
he
had
tricked
her
into
singing
for
him
a
she
did
not
want
to
sing
but
she
made
no
protest
swiftly
she
turned
and
slid
along
the
bench
her
fingers
touched
the
keys
and
she
began
he
watched
the
beauty
and
warmth
of
her
dainty
youth
with
eyes
that
mirrored
the
hunger
of
his
heart
how
buoyantly
she
carried
her
dusky
little
head
with
what
a
gallant
spirit
she
did
all
things
he
was
usually
a
frank
pagan
but
when
he
was
with
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
god
spoke
through
her
personality
all
sorts
of
brave
fine
promises
sheba
paid
her
pledge
in
full
after
the
first
two
stanzas
were
finished
she
sang
the
last
ones
as
well
an
what
about
the
wather
when
i
have
ould
paddy
boat
is
it
me
that
would
be
feared
to
grip
the
oars
an
go
afloat
oh
i
could
find
him
by
the
light
of
sun
or
moon
or
star
but
there
caulder
things
than
salt
waves
between
us
so
they
are
och
anee
sure
well
i
know
he
never
have
the
heart
to
come
to
me
an
love
is
wild
as
any
wave
that
wanders
on
the
sea
is
the
same
if
he
is
near
me
is
the
same
if
he
is
far
his
thoughts
are
hard
an
ever
hard
between
us
so
they
are
och
anee
her
hands
dropped
from
the
keys
and
she
turned
slowly
on
the
end
of
the
seat
the
dark
lashes
fell
to
her
hot
cheeks
he
did
not
speak
but
she
felt
the
steady
insistence
of
his
gaze
in
she
looked
at
him
the
pallor
of
his
face
lent
accent
to
the
fire
that
smouldered
in
his
eyes
i
going
to
marry
you
sheba
make
up
your
mind
to
that
girl
he
said
harshly
there
was
infinite
pity
in
the
look
she
gave
him
caulder
things
than
salt
waves
between
us
so
they
are
she
quoted
not
if
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
by
god
i
trample
down
everything
that
comes
between
us
he
swung
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
lounge
through
the
eyes
in
the
brooding
face
his
masterful
spirit
wrestled
with
hers
a
samson
with
broad
powerful
shoulders
and
deep
chest
he
dominated
his
world
ruthlessly
but
this
slim
irish
girl
with
the
young
lissom
body
held
her
own
must
we
go
through
that
again
she
asked
gently
again
and
again
until
you
see
reason
she
knew
the
tremendous
driving
power
of
the
man
and
she
was
afraid
in
her
heart
that
he
would
sweep
her
from
the
moorings
to
which
she
clung
there
is
something
else
i
have
told
you
the
embarrassed
lashes
lifted
bravely
from
the
flushed
cheeks
to
meet
steadily
his
look
i
do
think
that
i
care
for
you
is
i
that
am
shamed
at
my
fickleness
but
i
do
not
with
the
full
of
my
heart
his
bold
possessive
eyes
yielded
no
fraction
of
all
they
claimed
time
enough
for
that
sheba
truth
is
that
you
afraid
to
let
yourself
love
me
you
worried
because
you
ca
measure
me
by
the
little
you
brought
from
ireland
with
you
sheba
nodded
her
dusky
little
head
in
naïve
candor
i
think
there
will
be
some
truth
in
that
macdonald
you
lawless
you
know
i
a
law
to
myself
if
that
what
you
mean
it
is
my
business
to
help
hammer
out
an
empire
in
this
northland
if
i
let
my
work
be
cluttered
up
by
all
the
little
rules
made
by
little
men
for
other
little
ones
my
plans
would
come
to
a
standstill
i
am
a
practical
man
but
i
keep
sight
of
the
vision
no
need
for
me
to
brag
what
i
have
done
speaks
for
me
as
a
guidepost
to
what
i
mean
to
do
i
know
the
girl
admitted
with
the
impetuous
generosity
of
her
race
i
hear
it
from
everybody
you
have
built
towns
and
railroads
and
developed
mines
and
carried
the
twentieth
century
into
new
outposts
you
have
given
work
to
thousands
but
you
go
so
fast
i
ca
keep
step
with
you
i
am
one
of
the
little
folks
for
whom
laws
were
made
then
i
make
a
new
code
for
you
he
said
smiling
just
do
as
i
say
and
everything
will
come
out
right
faintly
her
smile
met
his
my
grandmother
might
have
agreed
to
that
but
we
live
in
a
new
world
for
women
they
have
to
make
their
own
decisions
i
suppose
that
is
a
part
of
the
penalty
we
pay
for
freedom
diane
came
into
the
room
and
macdonald
turned
to
her
i
have
just
been
telling
sheba
that
i
am
going
to
marry
her
that
there
is
no
escape
for
her
she
had
better
get
used
to
the
idea
that
i
intend
to
make
her
happy
the
older
cousin
glanced
at
sheba
and
laughed
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
whether
she
wants
to
be
happy
or
not
o
cave
man
i
going
to
make
her
want
to
sheba
fled
but
from
the
door
she
flung
back
her
challenge
i
think
so
chapter
xx
gordon
finds
himself
unpopular
macdonald
kept
his
word
to
sheba
he
used
his
influence
to
get
elliot
released
and
with
a
touch
of
cynicism
quite
characteristic
went
on
the
bond
of
his
rival
an
information
was
filed
against
the
field
agent
of
the
land
department
for
highway
robbery
and
attempted
murder
but
gordon
went
about
his
business
just
as
if
he
were
not
under
a
cloud
none
the
less
he
walked
the
streets
a
marked
man
women
and
children
looked
at
him
curiously
and
whispered
as
he
passed
the
sullen
hostile
eyes
of
miners
measured
him
silently
he
was
aware
that
feeling
had
focused
against
him
with
surprising
intensity
of
resentment
and
he
suspected
that
the
whispers
of
wally
selfridge
were
largely
responsible
for
this
for
wally
saw
to
it
that
in
the
minds
of
the
miners
elliot
in
his
own
person
stood
for
the
enemies
of
the
policy
he
scattered
broadcast
garbled
extracts
from
the
first
preliminary
report
of
the
field
agent
and
in
the
coal
camps
he
spread
the
impression
that
the
whole
mining
activities
of
the
territory
would
be
curtailed
if
elliot
had
his
way
in
the
states
the
fight
between
the
coal
claimants
and
their
foes
was
growing
more
bitter
the
muckrakers
were
busy
and
the
sentiment
outside
had
settled
so
definitely
against
granting
the
patents
that
the
national
administration
might
at
any
time
jettison
macdonald
and
his
backers
as
a
sop
to
public
opinion
it
was
not
hard
for
gordon
to
guess
how
unpopular
he
was
but
he
did
not
let
this
interfere
with
his
activities
he
moved
to
and
fro
among
the
mining
camps
with
absolute
disregard
of
the
growing
hatred
against
him
paget
came
to
him
at
last
with
a
warning
what
this
i
hear
about
you
being
almost
killed
up
on
bonanza
peter
wanted
to
know
down
in
the
none
such
mine
you
mean
it
did
seem
to
be
raining
hammers
as
i
went
down
the
shaft
admitted
his
friend
were
the
hammers
dropped
on
purpose
gordon
looked
at
him
with
a
grim
smile
your
guess
is
just
as
good
as
mine
peter
what
do
you
think
peter
answered
seriously
i
think
it
is
safe
for
you
to
take
the
chances
you
do
gordon
i
find
a
wrong
impression
about
you
prevalent
among
the
men
they
are
blaming
you
for
stirring
up
all
this
trouble
on
the
outside
and
they
are
worried
for
fear
the
mines
may
close
and
they
will
lose
their
jobs
i
tell
you
that
they
are
in
a
dangerous
mood
sorry
but
i
ca
help
that
you
can
stay
around
town
and
not
go
out
alone
nights
ca
you
i
dare
say
i
can
but
i
not
going
to
some
of
these
men
are
violent
they
do
think
straight
about
you
kindness
of
selfridge
contributed
gordon
perhaps
anyhow
there
a
lot
of
sullen
hate
brewing
against
you
do
invite
an
explosion
that
would
be
just
kid
foolhardiness
you
think
i
better
buy
another
automatic
gat
said
elliot
with
a
grin
i
think
you
had
better
use
a
little
sense
gordon
i
dare
say
i
am
exaggerating
the
danger
but
when
you
go
around
with
that
jaunty
way
of
yours
the
men
think
you
are
looking
for
trouble
and
you
likely
to
get
it
am
i
i
know
what
i
talking
about
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
men
think
you
tried
to
murder
macdonald
after
you
had
robbed
him
and
that
your
nerve
weakened
on
the
job
this
seems
to
some
of
the
most
lawless
to
give
them
a
moral
right
to
put
you
out
of
the
way
anyhow
it
is
a
kind
of
justification
according
to
their
point
of
view
i
not
defending
it
of
course
i
telling
you
so
that
you
can
appreciate
your
danger
you
have
done
your
duty
then
peter
but
you
do
intend
to
take
my
advice
i
tell
you
what
i
told
you
last
time
when
you
warned
me
i
going
through
with
the
job
i
been
hired
to
do
just
as
you
would
stick
it
out
in
my
place
i
do
think
i
in
much
danger
men
in
general
are
they
growl
but
they
do
go
as
far
as
murder
peter
gave
him
up
after
all
the
chances
were
that
gordon
was
right
alaska
was
not
a
lawless
country
and
it
might
be
that
the
best
way
to
escape
peril
was
to
walk
through
it
with
a
grin
as
if
it
did
not
exist
the
next
issue
of
the
kusiak
sun
contained
a
bitter
editorial
attack
upon
elliot
the
occasion
for
it
was
a
press
dispatch
from
washington
to
the
effect
that
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
had
become
so
strong
that
winton
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
might
be
forced
to
resign
his
place
this
was
a
blow
to
the
coal
claimants
and
the
sun
charged
in
vitriolic
language
that
the
reports
of
elliot
were
to
blame
he
was
the
newspaper
claimed
an
enemy
to
all
those
who
had
come
to
alaska
to
earn
an
honest
living
there
under
indictment
for
attempted
murder
and
for
highway
robbery
this
man
was
not
satisfied
with
having
tried
to
kill
from
ambush
the
best
friend
alaska
had
ever
known
in
every
report
that
he
sent
to
washington
he
was
dealing
underhanded
blows
at
the
prosperity
of
alaska
he
was
a
snake
in
the
grass
and
as
such
every
decent
man
ought
to
hold
him
in
scorn
elliot
read
this
just
as
he
was
leaving
for
the
willow
creek
camp
he
thrust
the
paper
impatiently
into
his
coat
pocket
and
swung
to
the
saddle
why
did
they
persecute
him
he
had
told
nothing
but
the
truth
nothing
not
required
of
him
by
the
simplest
elemental
honesty
yet
he
was
treated
as
an
outcast
and
a
criminal
the
injustice
of
it
was
beginning
to
rankle
he
was
temperamentally
an
optimist
but
depression
rode
with
him
to
the
gold
camp
and
did
not
lift
from
his
spirits
till
he
started
back
next
day
for
kusiak
the
news
had
been
flashed
by
wire
all
over
the
united
states
that
he
was
a
crook
his
friends
and
relatives
could
give
no
adequate
answer
to
the
fact
that
an
indictment
hung
over
his
head
in
alaska
he
was
already
convicted
by
public
opinion
even
the
pagets
were
lined
up
as
to
their
interests
with
macdonald
sheba
liked
him
and
believed
in
him
her
loyal
heart
acquitted
him
of
all
blame
but
it
was
to
the
wooing
of
his
enemy
that
she
had
listened
rather
than
to
his
the
big
scotchman
had
run
against
a
barrier
but
his
rival
expected
him
to
trample
it
down
he
would
wear
away
the
scruples
of
sheba
by
the
pressure
of
his
masterful
will
in
the
late
afternoon
while
gordon
was
still
fifteen
miles
from
kusiak
his
horse
fell
lame
he
led
it
limping
to
the
cabin
of
some
miners
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
had
been
drinking
heavily
from
a
jug
of
whiskey
left
earlier
in
the
day
by
the
gordon
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
accept
their
surly
permission
to
stay
for
the
night
but
the
lameness
of
his
horse
decided
him
not
caring
to
invite
their
hostility
he
gave
his
name
as
gordon
instead
of
elliot
he
was
to
learn
within
the
hour
that
this
was
mistake
number
two
from
a
pocket
of
the
coat
he
had
thrown
on
a
bed
protruded
the
newspaper
gordon
had
brought
from
kusiak
one
of
the
men
a
big
fellow
pulled
it
out
and
began
sulkily
to
read
while
he
read
the
other
two
bickered
and
drank
and
snarled
at
each
other
all
three
of
the
men
were
in
that
stage
of
drunkenness
when
a
quarrel
is
likely
to
flare
up
at
a
moment
notice
listen
here
demanded
the
man
with
the
newspaper
tell
you
what
boys
i
going
to
wring
the
neck
of
that
pussyfooting
spy
elliot
if
i
ever
get
a
chanct
he
read
aloud
the
editorial
in
the
sun
after
he
had
finished
the
others
joined
him
in
a
chorus
of
curses
i
always
did
hate
a
spy
and
this
one
a
murderer
too
why
do
some
one
fill
his
hide
with
lead
one
of
the
men
wanted
to
know
redhead
was
sitting
at
the
table
he
thumped
a
heavy
fist
down
so
hard
that
the
tin
cups
jumped
gim
me
a
crack
at
him
and
i
show
you
by
god
a
shadow
fell
across
the
room
in
the
doorway
stood
a
newcomer
gordon
had
a
sensation
as
if
a
lump
of
ice
had
been
drawn
down
his
spine
for
the
man
who
had
just
come
in
was
big
bill
macy
and
he
was
looking
at
the
field
agent
with
eyes
in
which
amazement
anger
and
triumph
blazed
i
glad
to
death
to
meet
up
with
you
again
elliot
he
jeered
seems
like
old
times
on
whad
you
say
his
name
is
cut
in
the
man
with
the
newspaper
has
he
introduced
himself
boys
macy
answered
with
a
cruel
grin
now
ai
that
modest
of
him
you
lads
are
entertaining
that
deteckative
and
spy
gordon
elliot
that
renowned
king
of
the
man
interrupted
with
a
howl
of
rage
if
you
telling
it
straight
bill
macy
i
learn
him
to
spy
on
me
elliot
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
beds
he
had
not
moved
an
inch
since
macy
had
appeared
but
the
brain
behind
his
live
eyes
was
taking
stock
of
the
situation
big
bill
blocked
the
doorway
the
table
was
in
front
of
the
window
unless
he
could
fight
his
way
out
there
was
no
escape
for
him
he
was
trapped
quietly
gordon
looked
from
one
to
another
he
read
no
hope
in
the
eyes
of
any
i
not
spying
on
you
my
horse
is
lame
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
all
i
asked
was
a
night
lodging
under
another
name
than
your
own
you
damned
sneak
the
field
agent
did
not
understand
the
fury
of
the
man
because
he
did
not
know
that
these
miners
were
working
the
claim
under
a
defective
title
and
that
they
had
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
come
to
get
evidence
against
them
but
he
knew
that
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
in
a
tighter
hole
in
another
minute
they
would
attack
him
whether
it
would
run
to
murder
he
could
not
tell
at
the
best
he
would
be
hammered
helpless
but
no
evidence
of
this
knowledge
appeared
in
his
manner
i
did
give
my
last
name
because
there
is
a
prejudice
against
me
in
this
country
he
explained
in
an
even
voice
he
wondered
as
he
spoke
if
he
had
better
try
to
fling
himself
through
the
window
sash
there
might
be
a
remote
chance
that
he
could
make
it
the
miner
at
the
table
killed
this
possibility
by
rising
and
standing
squarely
in
the
road

fervently
wished
he
had
but
he
was

his
eyes
quested
for
a
weapon

played

you
ca
get
away
with

know

is
back

i

mind

flashed
a

advice

given
him
by
a
professional
if
you
get
in
a
rough
house
do
wait
for
the
other
fellow
to
hit
first
they
were
crouching
for
the
attack
in
another
moment
they
would
be
upon
him
almost
with
one
motion
he
stooped
snatched
up
by
the
leg
a
heavy
stool
and
sprang
to
the
bed
upon
which
he
had
been
sitting
the
four
men
closed
with
him
in
a
rush
they
came
at
him
low
their
heads
protected
by
uplifted
arms
his
memory
brought
to
him
a
picture
of
the
whitewashed
gridiron
of
a
football
field
and
in
it
he
saw
a
vision
of
safety
the
stool
crashed
down
upon
big
bill
macy
head
gordon
hurdled
the
crumpling
figure
plunged
between
hands
outstretched
to
seize
him
and
over
the
table
went
through
the
window
taking
the
flimsy
sash
with
him
chapter

a
new
way
of
leaving
a
house
the
surge
of
disgust
with
which
sheba
had
broken
her
engagement
to
marry
macdonald
ebbed
away
as
the
weeks
passed
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
wait
upon
him
in
his
illness
and
hold
any
repugnance
toward
this
big
elemental
man
the
thing
he
had
done
might
be
wrong
but
the
very
openness
and
frankness
of
his
relation
to
meteetse
redeemed
it
from
shame
he
was
neither
a
profligate
nor
a
squawman
this
was
diane
point
of
view
and
in
time
it
became
to
a
certain
extent
that
of
sheba
one
takes
on
the
color
of
one
environment
and
the
girl
from
drogheda
knew
in
her
heart
that
meteetse
and
colmac
were
no
longer
the
real
barriers
that
stood
between
her
and
the
alaskan
she
had
been
disillusioned
saw
him
more
clearly
and
though
she
still
recognized
the
quality
of
bigness
that
set
him
apart
her
spirit
did
not
now
do
such
complete
homage
to
it
more
and
more
her
thoughts
contrasted
him
with
another
man
macdonald
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
he
had
lost
ground
but
with
the
dogged
determination
that
had
carried
him
to
success
he
refused
to
accept
the
verdict
she
was
a
woman
therefore
to
be
won
the
habit
of
victory
was
so
strong
in
him
that
he
could
see
no
alternative
he
embarrassed
her
with
his
downright
attentions
hemmed
her
in
with
courtesies
she
could
not
evade
if
she
appealed
to
her
cousin
diane
only
laughed
my
dear
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
to
him
he
is
going
to
marry
you
sheba
herself
began
to
be
afraid
he
would
there
was
something
dominant
and
masterful
about
the
man
that
swept
opposition
aside
he
had
a
way
of
getting
what
he
wanted
the
picnic
to
the
willow
creek
camp
was
a
case
in
point
sheba
did
not
want
to
go
but
she
went
she
would
much
rather
have
sat
in
the
rear
seat
with
diane
at
least
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
would
yet
she
occupied
the
place
beside
macdonald
in
front
the
girl
was
a
rebel
still
in
her
heart
she
was
not
wholly
reluctant
he
made
a
strong
appeal
to
her
imagination
she
felt
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
girl
to
be
indifferent
to
the
wooing
of
such
a
man
the
picnic
was
a
success
macdonald
was
an
outdoor
man
rather
than
a
parlor
one
he
took
charge
of
the
luncheon
lit
the
fire
and
cooked
the
coffee
without
the
least
waste
of
effort
in
his
the
neck
open
at
the
throat
he
looked
the
embodiment
of
masculine
vigor
diane
could
not
help
mentioning
it
to
her
cousin
is
he
a
splendid
human
animal
sheba
nodded
he
wonderful
if
i
were
a
little
irish
colleen
and
he
had
done
me
the
honor
to
care
for
me
i
have
fallen
fathoms
deep
in
love
with
him
the
irish
colleen
eyes
grew
reflective
not
if
you
had
seen
peter
first
di
there
nothing
reasonable
about
a
girl
i
do
believe
she
loves
or
else
she
just
does
diane
fired
a
question
at
her
have
you
met
peter
is
that
why
you
hang
back
the
color
flamed
into
sheba
face

outrageous
things

macdonald
drew
up
in
front
of
a
cabin
to
fill
the
radiator
he
stood
listening
beside
the
car
the
water
bucket
in
his
hand
something
unusual
was
going
on
inside
the
house
there
came
the
sound
of
a
thud
of
a
groan
and
then
the
crash
of
breaking
glass
the
whole
window
frame
seemed
to
leap
from
the
side
of
the
house
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
projected
through
the
broken
glass
the
man
swept
himself
free
of
the
débris
and
started
to
run
instantly
he
pulled
up
in
his
stride
as
amazed
to
see
those
in
the
car
as
they
were
to
see
him
gordon
cried
diane
out
of
the
house
poured
a
rush
of
men
they
too
pulled
up
abruptly
at
sight
of
macdonald
and
his
guests
a
sardonic
mirth
gleamed
in
the
eyes
of

you
always
come
out

mr
elliot
he
asked
only
when
i
in
a
hurry
gordon
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
and
dabbed
at
some
on
his
face
do
let
us
detain
you
said
the
alaskan
satirically
we
excuse
you
since
you
must
go
i
not
in
such
a

now
in
fact
if
you
going
to
kusiak
i
think
i
ask
you
for
a

coolly
and

evenly
what
were

doing

him

around

growled
one
of
the
miners
we
beat
his
damn
head
off
i
had
notions
like
that
myself
sometimes
assented
the
big
scotchman
but
i
think
we
had
all
better
leave
elliot
to
the
law
he
has
uncle
sam
back
of
him
in
his
spying
and
none
of
us
are
big
enough
to
buck

gordon
shook
hands
with
diane
and
sheba
went
into
the
house
for
his
coat
and
walked
to
the
stable
he
brought
out
his
horse
and
turned
it
loose
then
took
the
road
himself
for
kusiak
a
couple
of
miles
out
the
car
passed
him
trudging
townward
as
they
flashed
down
the
road
he
waved
a
cheerful
and
nonchalant
greeting
sheba
had
been
full
of
gayety
and
life
but
her
mood
was
changed
all
the
way
home
she
was

silent

was
no

of
preparation
for

since

ago
been
dropped
somewhere
in
the
north
the
outlaws
lay
hidden
swallowed
up
by
the
great
white
waste
of
snow
the
general
opinion
was
that
mac
was
playing
politics
about
the
trial
of
his
rival
he
would
not
let
the
case
come
to
a
jury
until
the
time
when
a
conviction
would
have
most
effect
in
the
states
the
gossips
predicted
they
did
not
know
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
return
of
wally
selfridge
the
whispers
touched
closely
the
personal
affairs
of
macdonald
the
report
of
his
engagement
to
sheba
had
been
denied
but
it
was
noticed
that
he
was
a
constant
guest
at
the
home
of
the
pagets
young
elliot
called
there
too
almost
any
day
one
or
other
of
the
two
men
could
be
seen
with
sheba
on
the
street
those
who
wanted
to
take
a
sporting
chance
on
the
issue
knew
that
odds
were
offered
at
the
pay
streak
saloon
of
three
to
one
on
mac
as
for
sheba
she
rebelled
impotently
at
the
situation
the
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
he
wooed
her
with
a
steady
dominant
persistence
that
shook
even
her
strong
young
will
there
was
something
resistless
in
the
way
he
took
her
for
granted
gordon
elliot
had
not
mentioned
love
to
her
though
there
were
times
when
her
heart
fluttered
for
fear
he
would
she
did
not
want
any
more
complications
she
wanted
to
be
let
alone
so
when
an
invitation
came
from
her
little
friends
the
husteds
signed
by
all
three
of
the
children
asking
her
to
come
and
visit
them
at
the
camp
back
of
katma
the
irish
girl
jumped
at
the
chance
to
escape
for
a
time
from
the
decision
being
forced
upon
her
sheba
pledged
her
cousin
to
secrecy
until
after
she
had
gone
so
that
miss
was
able
to
slip
away
on
the
stage
unnoticed
either
by
macdonald
or
elliot
the
only
other
passenger
was
an
elderly
woman
going
up
to
the
katma
camp
to
take
a
place
as
cook
later
on
the
same
day
wally
selfridge
coming
in
over
the
ice
reached
kusiak
with
important
news
for
his
chief
he
brought
with
him
an
order
from
winton
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
suspending
elliot
pending
an
investigation
of
the
charges
against
him
the
field
agent
was
to
forward
by
mail
all
documents
in
his
possession
and
for
the
time
at
least
drop
the
matter
of
the
coal
claims
oddly
enough
it
was
to
genevieve
mallory
that
macdonald
went
for
consolation
when
he
learned
that
sheba
had
left
town
he
had
always
found
it
very
pleasant
to
drop
in
for
a
chat
with
her
and
she
saw
to
it
that
he
met
the
same
friendly
welcome
now
that
a
rival
had
annexed
his
scalp
to
her
slender
waist
for
mallory
did
not
concede
defeat
if
the
irish
girl
could
be
eliminated
she
believed
she
would
yet
win
his
hostess
laced
her
fingers
behind
her
beautiful
tawny
head
quite
well
aware
that
the
attitude
set
off
the
perfect
modeling
of
the
soft
supple
body
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
mocking
little
smile
rumor
says
that
she
has
run
away
my
lord
is
it
true
yes
slipped
away
on
the
stage
this
morning
that
a
good
sign
she
was
afraid
to
stay
it
was
a
part
of
the
fiction
between
them
that
mallory
was
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
her
advice
in
his
wooing
of
her
rival
she
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
at
last
marry
sheba
after
wearing
away
the
rigid
puritanism
of
her
resentment
macdonald
had
never
liked
her
so
well
as
now
her
point
of
view
was
so
sane
so
reasonable
it
asked
for
no
impossible
virtues
in
a
man
there
was
something
restful
in
her
genial
derisive
understanding
of
him
she
had
a
silent
divination
of
his
moods
and
ministered
indolently
to
them
do
you
think
so
ought
i
to
follow
her
he
asked
she
showed
a
row
of
perfect
teeth
in
a
low
ripple
of
amusement
the
situation
at
least
was
piquant
even
though
it
was
at
her
expense
no
give
the
girl
time
catch
her
impulse
on
the
rebound
she
be
bored
to
death
at
katma
and
she
will
come
back
docile
her
scarlet
lips
the
long
unbroken
lines
of
the
sinuous
opulent
body
the
challenge
of
the
smouldering
eyes
the
warmth
of
her
laughter
all
invited
him
to
forget
the
charms
of
other
women
the
faint
feminine
perfume
of
her
was
wafted
to
his
brain
he
felt
a
besieging
of
the
blood
stepping
behind
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
he
tilted
back
the
head
of
lustrous
bronze
and
very
deliberately
kissed
her
on
the
lips
for
a
moment
she
gave
herself
to
his
embrace
then
pushed
him
back
rose
and
walked
across
the
room
to
a
little
table
with
fingers
that
trembled
slightly
she
lit
a
cigarette
sheathed
in
her
gown
she
made
a
strong
carnal
appeal
to
him
but
there
was
between
them
too
a
close
bond
of
the
spirit
he
made
no
apologies
no
explanation
presently
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
only
the
deeper
color
beneath
her
eyes
betrayed
any
excitement
unless
i
a
bad
prophet
you
get
the
answer
you
want
when
she
comes
back
colby
he
thought
her
reply
to
his
indiscretion
superb
it
admitted
complicity
reproached
warned
and
at
the
same
time
ignored
never
before
had
she
called
him
by
his
given
name
he
took
it
as
a
token
of
forgiveness
and
renunciation
why
was
it
not
genevieve
mallory
that
he
wanted
to
marry
it
would
be
the
wise
thing
to
do
she
would
ask
nothing
of
him
that
he
could
not
give
and
she
would
bring
to
him
many
things
that
he
wanted
but
he
was
under
the
spell
of
sheba
innocence
of
the
mystery
of
her
youth
of
the
charm
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
land
of
fairies
and
banshees
the
reasonable
course
made
just
now
not
enough
appeal
to
him
he
craved
the
rapture
of
an
impossible
adventure
into
a
world
wonderful
the
carried
with
him
back
to
his
office
a
sense
of
the
futile
irony
of
life
a
score
of
men
would
have
liked
to
marry
mallory
she
had
all
the
sophisticated
graces
of
life
and
much
of
the
natural
charm
of
an
unusually
attractive
personality
he
had
only
to
speak
the
word
to
win
her
and
his
fancy
had
flown
in
pursuit
of
a
little
puritan
with
no
knowledge
of
the
world
in
front
of
the
seattle
kusiak
emporium
the
scotchman
stopped
a
little
man
who
had
his
back
to
him
was
bargaining
for
a
team
of
huskies
the
man
turned
and
macdonald
recognized
him
hello
gid
are
you
off
your
usual
beat
a
bit
he
asked
the
little
miner
looked
him
over
impudently
well
well
if
it
the
big
mogul
himself
and
wantin
to
know
if
i
got
permission
to
travel
off
the
reservation
macdonald
laughed
tolerantly
he
had
that
large
poise
which
is
not
disturbed
by
the
sand
stings
of
life
i
reckon
you
travel
where
you
want
to
gid
same
as
i
do
maybeso
i
should
wonder
if
you
find
out
quite
soon
enough
what
i
doing
here
you
never
can
tell
the
old
man
retorted
with
a
manner
that
concealed
volumes
those
who
were
present
remembered
the
words
and
in
the
light
of
what
took
place
later
thought
them
significant
anyhow
it
is
quite
a
social
event
for
kusiak
macdonald
suggested
with
a
smile
of
irony
illustration
the
situation
at
least
was
piquant
even
though
it
was
at
her
expense
without
more
words
holt
turned
back
to
his
bargaining
the
big
scotchman
went
on
his
way
remembered
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
cashier
of
the
bank
which
he
controlled
and
promptly
forgot
that
old
gid
existed
the
old
man
concluded
his
purchase
and
drove
up
to
the
hotel
behind
one
of
the
best
dog
teams
in
alaska
he
had
paid
one
hundred
dollars
down
and
was
to
settle
the
balance
next
day
gideon
asked
a
question
of
the
porter
second
floor
that
his
room
up
there
the
man
answered
pointing
to
a
window
oh
you
seven
eighteen
the
little
miner
shouted
up
elliot
appeared
at
the
window
well
i
be
hanged
what
are
you
doing
here
onct
i
knew
a
man
lived
to
be
a
grandpa
minding
his
own
business
grinned
the
little
man
come
down
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
boy
in
half
a
minute
gordon
was
beside
him
after
the
first
greetings
the
young
man
nodded
toward
the
dog
team
how
did
you
persuade
tim
ryan
to
lend
you
his
huskies
why
do
you
take
a
paper
and
keep
up
with
the
news
son
these
huskies
do
belong
to
tim
meaning
that
gideon
holt
is
the
owner
you
done
guessed
it
admitted
the
miner
complacently
he
had
a
right
to
be
proud
of
the
team
it
was
a
famous
one
even
in
the
north
it
had
run
second
for
two
years
in
the
alaska
sweepstakes
to
macdonald
great
siberian
the
leader
butch
was
the
hero
of
a
dozen
races
and
a
hundred
savage
fights
what
in
halifax
do
you
want
with
the
team
asked
elliot
surprised
the
whole
outfit
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
some
dust
admitted
gideon
proudly
he
winked
mysteriously
at
gordon
i
got
a
use
for
this
team
if
any
one
was
to
ask
you
have
taken
the
government
mail
contract
have
you
not
so
you
could
notice
it
i
tell
you
what
i
want
with
this
team
as
the
old
sayin
is
holt
lowered
his
voice
and
narrowed
slyly
his
little
beadlike
eyes
i
going
to
put
a
crimp
in
colby
macdonald
that
what
i
aim
to
do
with
it
how
the
miner
beckoned
elliot
closer
and
whispered
in
his
ear
chapter
xxiii
in
the
dead
of
night
while
kusiak
slept
that
night
the
wind
shifted
it
came
roaring
across
the
range
and
drove
before
it
great
scudding
clouds
heavily
laden
with
sleety
snow
the
howling
storm
snuffed
out
the
moonlight
as
if
it
had
been
a
tallow
dip
and
fought
and
screamed
around
the
peaks
whirling
down
the
gulches
with
the
fury
of
a
blizzard
from
dark
till
dawn
the
roar
of
the
wind
filled
the
night
before
morning
heavy
drifts
had
wiped
out
the
roads
and
sheeted
the
town
in
virgin
white
unbroken
by
trails
or
furrows
with
the
coming
of
daylight
the
tempest
abated
kusiak
got
into
its
working
clothes
and
dug
itself
out
from
the
heavy
blanket
of
white
that
had
tucked
it
in
by
noon
the
business
of
the
town
was
under
way
again
that
which
would
have
demoralized
the
activities
of
a
southern
city
made
little
difference
to
these
arctic
circle
dwellers
roads
were
cleared
paths
shoveled
stores
opened
children
in
parkas
and
fur
coats
trooped
to
school
and
studied
through
the
short
afternoon
by
the
aid
of
electric
light
dusk
fell
early
and
with
it
came
a
scatter
of
more
snow
selfridge
gave
a
at
the
club
that
night
and
her
guests
came
in
furs
of
great
variety
and
much
value
the
hostess
outdid
herself
to
make
the
affair
the
most
elaborate
of
the
season
wally
had
brought
the
favors
in
from
seattle
and
also
the
wines
nobody
in
kusiak
of
any
social
importance
was
omitted
from
the
list
of
invited
except
gordon
elliot
even
the
grumpy
old
cashier
of
macdonald
bank
an
old
bachelor
who
lived
by
himself
in
rooms
behind
those
in
which
the
banking
was
done
was
persuaded
to
break
his
custom
and
appear
in
a
rusty
old
dress
suit
of
the
vintage
of
the
grizzled
cashier
his
name
was
robert
milton
left
the
clubhouse
early
for
his
rooms
it
was
snowing
but
the
wind
had
died
down
contrary
to
his
custom
he
had
taken
two
or
three
glasses
of
wine
his
brain
was
excited
so
that
he
knew
he
could
not
sleep
he
decided
to
read
don
quixote
by
the
stove
for
an
hour
or
two
the
heat
and
the
reading
together
would
make
him
drowsy
arrived
at
the
bank
he
let
himself
into
his
rooms
and
locked
the
door
he
stooped
to
open
the
draft
of
the
stove
when
a
sound
stopped
him
halfway
the
cashier
stood
rigid
still
crouched
waiting
for
a
repetition
of
the
noise
it
came
once
more
the
low
dull
rasping
of
a
file
shivers
ran
down
the
spine
of
milton
and
up
the
back
of
his
head
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
somebody
was
in
the
bank
at
two
in
the
morning
with
tools
for
burglary
he
was
a
scholarly
old
fellow
brought
up
in
new
england
and
cast
out
to
the
uttermost
frontier
by
the
malign
tragedy
of
poverty
adventure
offered
no
appeal
to
him
his
soul
quaked
as
he
waited
with
slack
feeble
muscles
upon
the
discovery
that
only
a
locked
door
stood
between
him
and
violent
ruffians
but
though
his
knees
trembled
beneath
him
and
the
sickness
of
fear
was
gripping
his
heart
robert
milton
had
in
him
the
dynamic
spark
that
makes
a
man
he
tiptoed
to
his
desk
and
with
shaking
fingers
gripped
the
revolver
that
lay
in
a
drawer
the
cashier
stood
there
for
a
moment
moistening
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
and
trying
to
swallow
the
lump
that
rose
to
his
throat
and
threatened
to
stop
his
breathing
he
braced
himself
for
the
plunge
then
slowly
trod
across
the
room
to
the
inner
locked
door
the
palsied
fingers
of
his
left
hand
could
scarce
turn
the
key
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
night
was
alive
with
the
noise
he
made
in
turning
the
lock
and
opening
the
door
the
hinges
grated
and
the
floor
squeaked
beneath
the
fall
of
his
foot
as
he
stood
at
the
threshold
two
men
were
in
front
of
the
wire
grating
which
protected
the
big
safe
that
filled
the
alcove
to
the
right
one
held
a
file
and
the
other
a
candle
their
blank
masked
faces
were
turned
toward
milton
and
each
of
them
covered
him
with
a
weapon
are
you
doing
here
quavered
the
cashier
drop
that
gun
came
the
low
sharp
command
from
one
of
them
under
the
menace
of
their
revolvers
the
heart
of
milton
pumped
water
instead
of
blood
the
strength
oozed
out
of
him
his
body
swayed
and
he
shut
his
eyes
a
hand
groped
for
the
casement
of
the
door
to
steady
him
drop
it
quick
some
old
ancestral
instinct
in
the
bank
cashier
rose
out
of
his
panic
to
destroy
him
he
wanted
to
lie
down
quietly
in
a
faint
but
his
mind
asserted
its
mastery
over
the
weakling
body
in
spite
of
his
terror
of
his
flaccid
will
he
had
to
keep
the
faith
he
was
guardian
of
the
bank
funds
at
all
costs
he
must
protect
them
his
forearm
came
up
with
a
jerk
two
shots
rang
out
almost
together
the
cashier
sagged
back
against
the
wall
and
slowly
slid
to
the
floor
the
guests
of
selfridge
danced
well
into
the
small
hours
the
california
champagne
that
wally
had
brought
in
stimulated
a
gayety
that
was
balm
to
his
wife
soul
she
wanted
her
to
be
smart
to
have
the
atmosphere
she
had
found
in
the
new
york
cabarets
if
everybody
talked
at
once
she
felt
they
were
having
a
good
time
if
nobody
listened
to
anybody
else
it
proved
that
the
affair
was
a
screaming
success
wally
was
satisfied
as
she
bade
her
guests
and
saw
them
pass
into
the
heavy
snow
that
was
again
falling
they
all
assured
her
that
there
had
not
been
so
hilarious
a
party
in
kusiak
one
a
trifle
lit
up
by
reason
of
too
much
hospitality
phrased
his
enjoyment
a
little
awkwardly
it
been
great
selfridge
nothing
like
it
since
the
days
of
the
open
dance
hall
mallory
hastily
suppressed
an
internal
smile
and
stepped
into
the
breach
do
you
do
it
she
asked
her
hostess
enviously
my
dear
if
say
it
was
a
success
what
else
could
one
say
genevieve
mallory
always
preferred
to
tell
the
truth
when
it
would
do
just
as
well
now
it
did
better
since
it
contributed
to
her
own
ironic
sense
of
amusement
macdonald
had
once
told
her
that
selfridge
made
him
think
of
the
saying
monkey
sees
monkey
does
the
effervescent
little
woman
had
never
had
an
original
idea
in
her
life
most
of
those
who
had
been
at
the
dance
slept
late
they
were
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
storm
had
quickened
again
into
a
howling
gale
nor
did
they
know
the
two
bits
of
news
that
were
passing
up
and
down
the
main
street
and
being
telephoned
from
house
to
house
one
of
the
items
was
that
the
stage
for
katma
had
failed
to
reach
the
roadhouse
at
smith
crossing
the
message
had
come
over
the
telephone
early
in
the
morning
the
keeper
of
the
roadhouse
added
his
private
fears
that
the
stage
crawling
up
the
divide
as
the
blizzard
swept
down
must
have
gone
astray
and
its
occupants
perished
the
second
bit
of
news
was
local
for
the
first
time
since
robert
milton
had
been
cashier
the
bank
had
failed
to
open
on
the
dot
the
snow
had
not
been
cleared
from
the
walk
in
front
and
no
smoke
was
pouring
from
the
chimney
of
the
building
chapter
xxiv
macdonald
follows
a
clue
macdonald
was
no
sluggard
it
was
his
habit
not
to
let
the
pleasure
of
the
night
before
interfere
with
the
business
of
the
morning
after
but
in
the
darkness
he
overslept
and
let
the
town
waken
before
him
he
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
knocking
on
his
door
who
is
it
he
asked
it
me
jones
gopher
jones
say
mac
the
bank
ai
open
and
we
ca
rouse
milton
thought
i
come
to
you
seeing
as
you
president
of
the
shebang
the
got
up
and
began
to
dress
probably
overslept
same
as
i
did
that
the
point
we
looked
through
the
window
of
his
bedroom
and
his
bed
ai
been
slept
in
in
three
minutes
macdonald
joined
the
marshal
and
walked
down
with
him
to
the
bank
he
unlocked
the
front
door
and
turned
to
the
little
crowd
that
had
gathered
better
wait
here
boys
gopher
and
i
will
go
in
i
expect
everything
is
all
right
but
we
let
you
know
about
that
as
soon
as
we
find
out
the
bank
president
opened
the
door
let
the
officer
enter
and
followed
himself
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
blinds
were
down
macdonald
struck
a
match
and
held
it
up
the
wood
burned
and
the
flame
flickered
out
bank
been
robbed
he
announced
quietly
looks
like
agreed
jones
his
voice
was
uneven
with
excitement
the
lit
another
match
in
the
flare
of
it
they
saw
that
the
steel
grill
cutting
off
the
alcove
was
open
and
that
the
door
had
been
blown
from
the
safe
it
lay
on
the
floor
among
a
litter
of
papers
silver
fragments
of
steel
and
bits
of
candle
the
marshal
clutched
at
the
arm
of
the
banker
did
you
see
that
he
whispered
his
finger
pointed
through
the
darkness
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
in
the
faint
gray
light
of
coming
day
macdonald
could
see
a
huddled
mass
on
the
floor
there
has
been
murder
done
i
get
a
light
do
move
from
here
jones
i
want
to
look
at
things
before
we
disturb
them
there
no
danger
the
robbers
have
been
gone
for
hours
gopher
had
as
much
nerve
as
the
next
man
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
he
could
see
what
danger
he
was
facing
but
there
was
something
sinister
and
here
he
wanted
to
throw
open
the
door
and
shout
the
news
to
those
outside
by
the
light
of
another
match
the
crossed
the
room
into
the
of
the
cashier
presently
he
returned
with
a
lamp
and
let
its
light
fall
upon
the
figure
lying
slumped
against
the
wall
a
revolver
lay
close
to
the
inert
fingers
the
head
hung
forward
grotesquely
upon
the
breast
the
dead
man
was
milton
his
employer
saw
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
twisted
neck
and
sprawling
limbs
the
cashier
had
died
to
save
the
money
entrusted
to
his
care
macdonald
handed
the
lamp
to
the
marshal
and
picked
up
the
revolver
every
chamber
was
loaded
they
beat
him
to
it
they
were
probably
here
when
he
reached
home
my
guess
is
he
heard
them
right
away
got
his
gun
and
came
in
still
wearing
his
dress
suit
that
gives
us
the
time
for
he
left
the
club
about
midnight
soon
as
they
saw
him
they
dropped
him
likely
they
heard
him
and
were
ready
i
would
have
had
this
happen
for
all
the
money
in
the
safe
how
much
was
there
in
it
i
do
know
exactly
the
books
will
show
i
send
wally
down
to
look
them
over
shot
right
spang
through
the
heart
looks
like
commented
jones
following
with
his
eye
the
course
of
the
wound
wish
i
been
here
instead
of
him
macdonald
said
grimly
his
eyes
softened
as
he
continued
to
look
down
at
the
employee
who
had
paid
with
his
life
for
his
faithfulness
it
was
an
even
break
poor
old
fellow
you
were
built
for
a
job
like
this
robert
milton
but
you
played
your
hand
out
to
a
finish
that
all
any
man
can
do
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
began
examining
the
safe
the
silver
still
stood
sacked
in
one
large
compartment
the
had
escaped
the
hurried
search
of
the
robbers
but
the
gold
was
practically
all
gone
one
sack
had
been
torn
by
the
explosion
and
single
pieces
of
gold
could
be
found
all
over
the
safe
macdonald
glanced
over
the
papers
rapidly
the
officer
picked
up
one
of
dozens
scattered
over
the
floor
it
was
a
mortgage
note
made
out
to
the
bank
by
a
miner
he
collected
the
others
evidently
the
bandits
had
torn
off
the
rubber
glanced
over
one
or
two
to
see
if
they
had
any
cash
value
and
tossed
the
package
into
the
air
as
a
disgusted
gambler
does
a
pack
of
cards
the
bank
president
stepped
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
he
explained
the
situation
in
three
sentences
i
ca
let
you
in
now
boys
until
the
coroner
has
been
here
he
went
on
to
tell
the
crowd
but
there
is
one
way
you
can
all
help
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
have
seen
any
suspicious
characters
around
let
me
know
or
if
any
one
has
left
town
in
a
hurry
or
been
seen
doing
anything
during
the
night
that
you
did
not
understand
at
the
time
men
ca
do
a
thing
like
this
without
leaving
some
clue
behind
them
even
though
the
snow
has
wiped
away
their
trail
a
man
named
fred
tague
pushed
to
the
front
he
kept
a
feed
corral
near
the
edge
of
town
i
can
tell
you
one
man
who
mushed
out
before
five
this
morning
and
that
gid
holt
the
eyes
of
macdonald
cold
and
hard
as
jade
fastened
to
the
man
how
do
you
know
that
dog
team
he
bought
from
tim
ryan
well
he
been
keeping
it
in
my
corral
when
i
got
there
this
morning
it
was
gone
the
snow
had
wiped
out
the
tracks
of
the
runners
yet
so
he
could
have
left
more
than
fifteen
minutes
before
what
time
was
it
when
you
reached
the
corral
might
have
been
six
maybe
a
little
later
you
do
know
that
holt
took
the
team
himself
come
to
that
i
do
but
he
had
a
key
to
the
barn
where
the
sled
was
holt
has
been
putting
up
at
the
hotel
i
reckon
it
is
easy
to
find
out
if
he
still
there
macdonald
keen
brain
followed
the
facts
as
the
nose
of
a
bloodhound
does
a
trail
holt
an
open
enemy
of
his
had
reached
town
only
two
days
before
he
had
bought
one
of
the
best
and
swiftest
dog
teams
in
the
north
and
had
let
slip
before
witnesses
the
remark
that
macdonald
would
soon
find
out
what
he
wanted
with
the
outfit
the
bank
had
been
robbed
after
midnight
to
file
open
the
grill
and
to
blow
up
the
safe
must
have
taken
several
hours
before
morning
the
dogs
of
holt
had
taken
the
trail
if
their
owner
were
with
them
it
was
a
safe
bet
that
the
sled
carried
forty
thousand
dollars
in
alaska
gold
dust
so
far
the
mind
of
the
scotchman
followed
the
probabilities
logically
but
at
this
point
it
made
a
jump
there
were
at
least
two
robbers
he
was
morally
sure
of
that
for
this
was
not
a
job
now
if
holt
had
with
him
a
companion
who
of
all
those
in
kusiak
was
the
most
likely
man
he
was
a
friendless
crabbed
old
fellow
since
coming
to
kusiak
old
gideon
had
been
seen
constantly
with
one
man
together
they
had
driven
out
the
day
before
and
tried
his
new
team
they
had
been
with
each
other
at
dinner
and
had
later
left
the
hotel
together
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
been
so
friendly
with
old
holt
was
gordon
elliot
and
elliot
not
only
was
another
enemy
of
macdonald
but
had
very
good
reasons
for
getting
out
of
the
country
just
now
the
strong
jaw
of
the
stood
out
saliently
as
he
gave
short
sharp
orders
to
men
in
the
crowd
one
was
to
get
the
coroner
a
second
wally
selfridge
another
the
united
states
district
attorney
he
divided
the
rest
into
squads
to
guard
the
roads
leading
out
of
town
and
to
see
that
nobody
passed
for
the
present
as
soon
as
the
men
he
had
sent
for
arrived
macdonald
went
over
the
scene
of
the
crime
with
them
it
was
plain
that
the
dynamiting
had
been
done
by
an
miner
who
knew
his
business
but
there
had
been
brains
in
the
planning
of
the
robbery
there
is
no
ivory
above
the
ears
of
the
man
who
bossed
this
job
macdonald
told
the
others
he
picks
a
night
when
we
all
at
the
club
more
than
half
a
mile
from
here
a
stormy
night
when
folks
are
not
wandering
the
streets
he
knows
that
the
wind
will
deaden
the
sound
of
the
dynamite
and
that
the
snow
will
wipe
out
any
tracks
that
might
help
to
identify
him
and
his
pal
or
show
which
way
they
have
gone
the
coroner
took
charge
of
the
body
and
wally
of
the
bank
the
and
the
district
attorney
walked
up
to
the
hotel
together
as
soon
as
they
had
explained
what
they
wanted
the
landlord
got
a
passkey
and
took
them
to
the
room
holt
had
used
apparently
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
in
the
basket
the
district
attorney
found
something
which
he
held
up
in
a
significant
silence
macdonald
stepped
forward
and
took
from
him
a
small
cloth
sack
one
of
those
we
keep
our
gold
in
at
the
bank
said
the
scotchman
after
a
close
examination
this
definitely
ties
up
holt
with
the
robbery
now
for
elliot
he
left
the
hotel
with
holt
about
five
this
morning
the
porter
says
this
was
the
contribution
of
the
landlord
the
room
of
gordon
elliot
was
in
great
disorder
garments
had
been
tossed
on
the
bed
and
on
every
chair
and
had
been
left
to
lie
wherever
they
had
chanced
to
fall
plainly
their
owner
had
been
in
great
haste
macdonald
looked
through
the
closet
where
clothes
hung
his
new
fur
coat
is
not
here
nor
his
trail
boots
looks
to
me
as
though
gordon
had
hit
the
trail
with
his
friend
holt
this
opinion
was
strengthened
when
it
was
learned
from
a
in
town
that
holt
and
elliot
had
routed
him
out
of
bed
in
the
early
morning
to
sell
them
two
weeks
supplies
these
they
had
packed
upon
the
sled
outside
the
store
it
a
cinch
bet
that
elliot
took
the
trail
with
him
the
lawyer
conceded
all
doubt
of
this
was
removed
when
a
prospector
reached
town
with
the
news
that
he
had
met
holt
and
elliot
traveling
toward
the
divide
as
fast
as
they
could
drive
the
dogs
the
big
scotchman
ordered
his
team
of
siberian
made
ready
for
the
trail
as
he
donned
his
heavy
furs
colby
macdonald
smiled
with
deep
satisfaction
he
had
elliot
on
the
run
at
last
just
as
he
closed
the
door
of
his
room
macdonald
heard
the
telephone
bell
ring
he
hesitated
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
strode
out
into
the
storm
if
he
had
answered
the
call
he
would
have
learned
from
diane
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
that
the
stage
upon
which
sheba
had
started
for
katma
had
not
reached
the
roadhouse
at
smith
crossing
five
minutes
later
the
winners
of
the
great
alaska
sweepstakes
were
flying
down
the
street
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
armed
with
a
rifle
and
a
revolver
their
owner
was
mushing
into
the
hills
to
bring
back
the
men
who
had
robbed
his
bank
and
killed
the
cashier
he
traveled
alone
because
he
could
go
faster
without
a
companion
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
not
a
match
for
any
two
men
he
might
face
chapter
xxv
in
the
blizzard
swiftwater
pete
the
driver
of
the
stage
between
kusiak
and
katma
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
sky
as
his
ponies
breasted
the
long
uphill
climb
that
ended
at
the
pass
it
was
his
habit
to
grumble
he
had
been
complaining
ever
since
they
had
started
but
as
he
studied
the
heavy
billows
of
cloud
banked
above
the
peaks
and
in
the
saddle
between
there
was
real
anxiety
in
his
red
apoplectic
face
gittin
her
back
up
for
a
blizzard
looks
like
doggone
it
if
that
would
jest
be
my
luck
he
murmured
fretfully
sheba
hoped
there
would
be
one
not
of
course
a
really
truly
blizzard
such
as
macdonald
had
told
her
about
but
the
tail
of
a
one
enough
to
send
her
glowing
with
exhilaration
into
the
roadhouse
with
the
happy
sense
of
an
adventure
achieved
the
girl
had
got
out
to
relieve
the
horses
and
as
her
young
lissom
body
took
the
hill
scattering
flakes
of
snow
were
already
flying
she
was
buoyed
up
by
a
sense
of
freedom
for
a
time
at
least
she
was
escaping
macdonald
driving
energy
the
appeal
of
gordon
elliot
warm
friendliness
and
the
unvoiced
urging
of
diane
good
old
peter
and
the
kiddies
were
the
only
ones
that
let
her
alone
she
looked
back
at
the
horses
laboring
up
the
hill
swiftwater
had
got
down
and
was
urging
them
forward
his
long
whip
crackling
about
the
ears
of
the
leaders
he
waddled
as
he
walked
his
fat
legs
were
too
short
for
the
round
barrel
body
a
big
roll
of
fat
bulged
out
over
the
collar
of
his
shirt
whenever
he
was
excited
and
he
always
was
on
the
least
excuse
he
puffed
and
snorted
and
grew
alarmingly
purple
fat
chance
he
exploded
as
soon
as
he
got
within
hearing
snow
in
those
clouds
tons
of
it
h
and
wind
wow
we
in
for
an
blizzard
sure
as
you
a
foot
high
swiftwater
was
worried
he
would
have
liked
to
turn
and
run
for
it
but
the
last
roadhouse
was
miles
back
if
the
blizzard
came
howling
down
the
slope
they
would
have
a
sweet
time
of
it
reaching
safety
smith
crossing
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
divide
only
nine
miles
away
they
would
have
to
worry
through
somehow
probably
those
angry
clouds
were
half
a
bluff
the
temperature
was
dropping
rapidly
already
snow
fell
fast
in
big
thick
flakes
to
make
it
worse
the
wind
was
beginning
to
rise
it
came
in
shrill
gusts
momentarily
increasing
in
force
the
knew
the
signs
of
old
and
cursed
the
luck
that
had
led
him
to
bring
the
stage
it
was
to
have
been
the
last
trip
with
horses
until
spring
his
dogs
were
waiting
for
him
at
katma
for
the
return
journey
he
did
not
blame
himself
for
there
was
no
reason
to
expect
such
a
storm
so
early
in
the
season
none
the
less
it
was
too
bad
that
his
lead
dog
had
been
ailing
when
he
left
the
gold
camp
eight
days
before
miss
knew
that
swiftwater
pete
was
anxious
and
though
she
was
not
yet
afraid
the
girl
understood
the
reason
for
it
the
road
ran
through
the
heart
of
a
vast
the
surface
of
which
was
being
swept
by
a
screaming
wind
the
air
was
full
of
sifted
white
dust
and
the
road
furrow
was
rapidly
filling
soon
it
would
be
obliterated
already
the
horses
were
panting
and
struggling
as
they
ploughed
forward
sheba
tramped
behind
the
and
in
her
tracks
walked
olson
the
other
passenger
through
the
muffled
scream
of
the
storm
swiftwater
shouted
back
to
sheba
you
wanta
keep
close
to
me
she
nodded
her
head
his
order
needed
no
explanation
the
world
was
narrowing
to
a
lane
whose
walls
she
could
almost
touch
with
her
fingers
a
pall
of
white
wrapped
them
upon
them
beat
a
wind
of
stinging
sleet
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
blurred
outlines
of
the
stage
and
the
driver
figure
the
bitter
cold
searched
through
sheba
furs
to
her
soft
flesh
and
the
blast
of
powdered
ice
beat
upon
her
face
the
snow
was
getting
deeper
as
the
road
filled
once
or
twice
she
stumbled
and
fell
her
strength
ebbed
and
the
hinges
of
her
knees
gave
unexpectedly
beneath
her
how
long
was
it
she
asked
herself
that
macdonald
had
said
men
could
live
in
a
blizzard
staggering
blindly
forward
sheba
bumped
into
the
driver
he
had
drawn
up
to
give
the
horses
a
moment
rest
before
sending
them
plunging
at
the
snow
again
no
chance
he
called
into
the
young
woman

make

the

the

in

was

again
ten
yards
beyond

dozen
times
the
horses
gave
up
answered
the
sting
of
the
whip
by
diving
head
first
at
the
white
banks
and
were
stopped
by
fresh
pete
gave
up
the
fight
he
began
unhitching
the
horses
while
sheba
and
olson
clinging
to
each
other
hands
stumbled
forward
to
join
him
the
words
he
shouted
across
the
back
of
a
horse
were
almost
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
shrieking
wind
heluvatime

gulch
sheba
made
out
he
flung
olson
astride
one
of
the
wheelers
and
helped
sheba
to
the
back
of
the
right
leader
swiftwater
clambered
upon
its
mate
himself
the
girl
paid
no
attention
to
where
they
were
going
the
urge
of
life
was
so
faint
within
her
that
she
did
not
greatly
care
whether
she
lived
or
died
her
face
was
blue
from
the
cold
her
vitality
was
sapped
she
seemed
to
herself
to
have
turned
to
ice
below
the
hips
outside
the
misery
of
the
moment
her
whole
attention
was
concentrated
on
sticking
to
the
back
of
the
horse
numb
though
her
fingers
were
she
must
keep
them
fastened
tightly
in
the
frozen
mane
of
the
animal
she
recited
her
lesson
to
herself
like
a
child
she
must
stick
on
she
must
she
must
whether
she
lost
consciousness
or
not
sheba
never
knew
the
next
she
realized
was
that
swiftwater
pete
was
pulling
her
from
the
horse
he
dragged
her
into
a
cabin
where
olson
lay
crouched
on
the
floor
got
to
stable
the
horses
he
explained
and
left
them
after
a
time
he
came
back
and
lit
a
fire
in
the
stove
as
the
circulation
that
meant
life
flooded
back
into
her
chilled
veins
sheba
endured
a
of
excruciating
pain
she
had
to
clench
her
teeth
to
keep
back
the
groans
that
came
from
her
throat
to
walk
the
floor
and
nurse
her
tortured
hands
with
fingers
in
like
plight
the
cabin
was
empty
of
furniture
except
for
a
table
rough
stools
and
the
frame
of
a
bed
the
last
occupant
had
left
a
little
firewood
beside
the
stove
enough
to
last
perhaps
for
hours
sheba
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
if
the
blizzard
lasted
long
enough
they
would
starve
to
death
in
the
handbag
left
in
the
stage
were
a
box
of
candy
and
an
irish
plum
pudding
she
had
brought
the
latter
from
the
old
country
with
her
and
was
taking
it
and
the
chocolates
to
the
husted
children
but
just
now
the
stage
was
as
far
from
them
as
drogheda
like
many
rough
frontiersmen
swiftwater
pete
was
a
diamond
in
the
raw
he
had
the
kindly
gentle
instincts
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
good
man
so
far
as
could
be
he
made
a
hopeless
and
impossible
situation
comfortable
his
judgment
told
him
that
they
were
caught
in
a
trap
from
which
there
was
no
escape
but
for
the
sake
of
the
women
he
put
a
cheerful
face
on
things
lucky
we
found
this
cabin
he
growled
amiably
by
this
time
we
been
up
salt
creek
if
we
had
seeing
as
our
luck
has
stood
up
so
far
i
reckon
we
be
all
right
mighty
kind
of
last
tenant
to
leave
us
this
firewood
comes
to
a
showdown
we
got
one
table
four
stools
and
a
bed
that
will
make
fuel
we
ai
so
worse
off
if
we
only
had
some
food
olson
suggested
food
pete
looked
at
her
in
assumed
surprise
huh
what
about
all
that
live
stock
i
got
in
the
stable
i
heard
tell
that
broncho
tenderloin
is
a
favorite
dish
with
them
there
french
chiefs
that
do
the
cooking
they
kinder
trim
it
up
so
it
as
good
as
frawgs
legs
sheba
had
never
before
slept
on
bare
boards
with
a
sealskin
coat
for
a
but
she
was
very
tired
and
dropped
off
almost
instantly
twice
she
woke
during
the
night
disturbed
by
the
stiffness
and
the
pain
of
her
body
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
hard
whipsawed
planks
were
pushing
through
the
soft
flesh
to
the
bones
she
was
cold
too
and
crept
closer
to
the
stout
swedish
woman
lying
beside
her
presently
she
fell
asleep
again
to
the
sound
of
the
blizzard
howling
outside
when
she
wakened
for
the
third
time
it
was
morning
in
the
afternoon
the
blizzard
died
away
as
far
as
she
could
see
sheba
looked
out
upon
a
waste
of
snow
her
eyes
turned
from
the
desolation
without
to
the
bare
and
cheerless
room
in
which
they
had
found
shelter
in
spite
of
herself
a
little
shiver
ran
down
the
spine
of
the
girl
had
she
come
into
this
arctic
solitude
to
find
her
tomb
resolutely
she
brushed
the
gloomy
thought
from
her
mind
and
began
to
chat
with
olson
in
a
corner
of
the
cabin
sheba
had
found
a
torn
and
disreputable
copy
of
vanity
fair
the
covers
and
the
first
forty
pages
were
gone
a
splash
of
what
appeared
to
be
tobacco
juice
defiled
the
last
sheet
but
the
fortunes
of
becky
and
amelia
had
served
to
make
her
forget
during
the
morning
that
she
was
hungry
and
likely
to
be
much
hungrier
before
another
day
had
passed
as
soon
as
the
storm
had
moderated
enough
to
let
him
go
out
with
safety
swiftwater
pete
had
taken
one
of
the
horses
for
an
attempt
at
me
i
after
that
plum
pudding
i
got
ta
get
a
feed
of
oats
from
the
stage
for
my
bronchs
too
the
scenery
here
is
sure
fine
but
it
what
you
would
call
nourishing
huh
watch
our
smoke
when
me
and
old
baldface
git
to
bucking
them
drifts
he
had
been
gone
two
hours
and
the
early
dusk
was
already
descending
over
the
white
waste
when
sheba
ventured
out
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
but
the
cold
was
so
bitter
that
she
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
to
fight
her
way
through
the
drifts
and
turned
back
to
the
cabin
sometime
later
swiftwater
pete
came
stumbling
into
their
temporary
home
he
was
fagged
to
exhaustion
but
triumphant
upon
the
table
he
dropped
from
the
crook
of
his
numbed
arm
two
packages
the
makings
for
a
christmas
dinner
he
said
with
a
grin
after
he
had
taken
off
his
mukluks
and
his
frozen
socks
they
wrapped
him
in
their
furs
while
he
toasted
before
the
stove
olson
thawed
out
the
pudding
and
the
chocolates
in
the
oven
and
made
a
kind
of
mush
out
of
some
oats
pete
had
saved
from
the
horse
feed
they
ate
their
meal
in
high
spirits
the
freeze
had
saved
their
lives
if
it
held
clear
till
they
could
reach
smith
crossing
on
the
crust
of
the
snow
swiftwater
broke
up
the
chairs
for
fuel
and
demolished
the
legs
of
the
table
after
which
he
lay
down
before
the
stove
and
fell
at
once
into
a
sodden
sleep
presently
olson
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
began
to
snore
regularly
sheba
could
not
sleep
the
boards
tired
her
bones
and
she
was
cold
sometimes
she
slipped
into
cat
naps
that
were
full
of
bad
dreams
she
thought
she
was
walking
on
the
of
a
precipice
and
that
colby
macdonald
pushed
her
from
her
precarious
footing
and
laughed
at
her
as
she
slid
swiftly
toward
the
gulf
below
when
she
wakened
with
a
start
it
was
to
find
that
the
fire
had
died
down
she
was
shivering
from
lack
of
cover
quietly
the
girl
replenished
the
fire
and
lay
down
again
when
she
wakened
with
a
start
it
was
morning
a
faint
light
sifted
through
the
single
window
of
the
shack
sheba
whispered
to
the
older
woman
that
she
was
going
out
for
a
little
walk
be
careful
dearie
advised
olson
i
would
try
to
go
too
far
sheba
smiled
to
herself
at
the
warning
it
was
not
likely
that
she
would
go
far
enough
to
get
lost
with
all
these
millions
of
tons
of
snow
piled
up
around
her
in
every
direction
she
had
come
out
because
she
was
restless
and
was
tired
of
the
dingy
and
uncomfortable
room
without
any
definite
intentions
she
naturally
followed
the
trail
that
swiftwater
had
broken
the
day
before
no
wind
stirred
and
the
sky
was
clear
but
it
was
very
cold
the
sun
would
not
be
up
for
half
an
hour
as
she
worked
her
way
down
the
gulch
sheba
wondered
whether
the
news
of
their
loss
had
reached
kusiak
were
search
parties
out
already
to
rescue
them
colby
macdonald
had
gone
out
into
the
blizzard
years
ago
to
save
her
father
perhaps
he
might
have
been
out
all
night
trying
to
save
her
father
daughter
peter
would
go
of
course
and
gordon
elliot
the
work
in
the
mines
would
stop
and
men
would
volunteer
by
scores
that
was
one
fine
thing
about
the
north
it
responded
to
the
unwritten
law
that
a
man
must
risk
his
own
life
to
save
others
but
if
the
wires
had
come
down
in
the
storm
kusiak
would
not
know
they
had
not
got
through
to
smith
crossing
swiftwater
pete
spoke
cheerfully
about
mushing
to
the
roadhouse
but
sheba
knew
the
snow
would
not
bear
the
horses
they
would
have
to
walk
and
it
was
not
at
all
certain
that
olson
could
do
so
long
a
walk
with
the
thermometer
at
forty
or
fifty
below
zero
from
a
little
knoll
sheba
looked
down
upon
the
top
of
the
stage
three
hundred
yards
below
her
and
while
she
stood
there
the
promise
of
the
new
day
was
blazoned
on
the
sky
it
came
with
amazing
beauty
of
green
and
primrose
and
amethyst
while
the
stars
flickered
out
and
the
heavens
took
on
the
blue
of
sunrise
in
a
crotch
between
two
peaks
a
faint
golden
glow
heralded
the
sun
a
circle
of
lovely
flushed
the
horizon
sheba
had
this
much
of
the
poet
in
her
that
every
sunrise
was
still
a
miracle
she
drew
a
deep
slow
breath
of
adoration
and
turned
away
as
she
did
so
her
eyes
dilated
and
her
body
grew
rigid
across
the
snow
waste
a
man
was
coming
he
was
moving
toward
the
cabin
and
must
cross
the
trench
close
to
her
the
heart
of
the
girl
stopped
then
beat
wildly
to
make
up
the
lost
stroke
he
had
come
through
the
blizzard
to
save
her
at
that
very
instant
as
if
the
stage
had
been
set
for
it
the
wonderful
alaska
sun
pushed
up
into
the
crotch
of
the
peaks
and
poured
its
radiance
over
the
arctic
waste
the
pink
glow
swept
in
a
tide
of
delicate
color
over
the
snow
and
transmuted
it
to
millions
of
sparkling
diamonds
the
great
magician
wand
had
recreated
the
world

though
a
malemute
had
a
strong
strain
of

in
him
it
gave
him
a

his

was
to
see

out
on

took
turns
in
going
ahead
of

and
breaking

it
was
heavy
work
before
noon
they
were
both
utterly
fatigued
they
dragged
forward
through
the
slush
lifting
their
laden
feet
sluggishly
they
must
keep
going
and
they
did
but
it
seemed
to
them
that

step
must
be
the
last
shortly
after
noon
the
storm
wore
itself
out
the
temperature
had
been
steadily
falling
and
now
it
took
a
rapid
drop
they
were
passing
through
timber
and
on
a
little
slope
they
built
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
a

by
careful

they
soon
had

when
they
took
the

again
it
was
in

instead
of

the

was
growing
steadily
colder

with

necessary
the
little
party
pounded
steadily
over
the
barren
hills
there
was
no
sign
of
life
except
what
they
brought
with
them
out
of
the
arctic
silence
and
carried
with
them
into
the
greater
silence
beyond
a
little
cloud
of
steam
enveloped
them
as
they
moved
the
moisture
from
the
breath
of
nine
moving
creatures
in
a
waste
of
emptiness
each
of
the
men
wrapped
a
long
scarf
around
his
mouth
and
nose
for
protection
and
as
the
part
in
front
of
his
face
became
a
sheet
of
ice
shifted
the
muffler
to
another
place
night
fell
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
but
they
kept
traveling
not
till
they
were
well
up
toward
the
summit
of
the
divide
did
they
decide
to
camp
they
drove
into
a
little
draw
and
unharnessed
the
weary
dogs
it
was
bitterly
cold
but
they
were
forced
to
set
up
the
tent
and
stove
to
keep
from
freezing
their
numbed
fingers
made
a
slow
job
of
the
camp
preparations
at
last
the
stove
was
going
the
dogs
fed
and
they
themselves
thawed
out
they
fell
asleep
shortly
to
the
sound
of
the
mournful
howling
of
the
dogs
outside
long
before
daybreak
they
were
afoot
again
holt
went
out
to
chop
some
wood
for
the
stove
while
gordon
made
breakfast
preparations
the
little
miner
brought
in
an
armful
of
wood
and
went
out
to
get
a
second
supply
a
few
moments
later
elliot
heard
a
cry
he
stepped
out
of
the
tent
and
ran
to
the
spot
where
holt
was
lying
under
a
mass
of
ice
and
snow
the
young
man
threw
aside
the
broken
blocks
that
had
plunged
down
from
a
ledge
above
badly
hurt
gid
he
asked
i
done
bust
my
laig
son
the
old
man
answered
with
a
twisted
grin
you
mean
that
it
is
broken
tell
you
that
in
a
minute
he
felt
his
leg
carefully
and
with
elliot
help
tried
to
get
up
groaning
he
slid
back
to
the
snow
yep
she
busted
he
announced
gordon
carried
him
to
the
tent
and
laid
him
down
carefully
the
old
miner
swore
softly
ai
this
a
hell
of
a
note
boy
you
have
to
get
me
to
crossing
and
leave
me
there
it
was
the
only
thing
to
be
done
elliot
broke
camp
and
packed
the
sled
upon
the
load
he
put
his
companion
well
wrapped
up
in
furs
he
harnessed
the
dogs
and
drove
back
to
the
road
two
miles
farther
up
the
road
gordon
stopped
his
team
sharply
he
had
turned
a
bend
in
the
trail
and
had
come
upon
an
empty
stage
buried
in
the
snow
the
fear
that
had
been
uppermost
in
elliot
mind
for
hours
clutched
at
his
throat
was
it
tragedy
upon
which
he
had
come
after
his
long
journey
holt
guessed
the
truth
they
got
stalled
and
cut
loose
the
horses
must
have
tried
to
ride
the
cayuses
to
shelter
to
smith
crossing
asked
gordon
expect
so
then
with
a
whoop
the
man
on
the
sled
contradicted
himself
no
by
moses
to
dick
fiddler
old
cabin
up
the
draw
where
swiftwater
would
aim
for
till
the
blizzard
was
over
where
is
it
demanded
his
friend
swing
over
to
the
right
and
follow
the
little
gulch
i
wait
till
you
come
back
gordon
dropped
the
and
started
on
the
instant
eagerness
anxiety
dread
fought
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
any
moment
now
he
might
stumble
upon
the
evidence
of
the
sad
story
which
is
repeated
in
alaska
many
times
every
winter
it
rang
in
him
like
a
bell
that
where
tough
hardy
miners
succumbed
a
frail
girl
would
have
small
chance
he
cut
across
over
the
hill
toward
the
draw
and
at
what
he
saw
his
pulse
quickened
smoke
was
pouring
out
of
the
chimney
of
a
cabin
and
falling
groundward
as
it
does
in
the
arctic
during
very
cold
weather
had
sheba
found
safety
there
or
was
it
the
winter
home
of
a
prospector
as
he
pushed
forward
the
rising
sun
flooded
the
earth
with
pink
and
struck
a
million
sparkles
of
color
from
the
snow
the
wonder
of
it
drew
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
for
a
moment
toward
the
hills
a
tumult
of
joy
flooded
his
veins
the
girl
who
held
in
her
soft
hands
the
happiness
of
his
life
stood
looking
at
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
the
core
of
all
that
lovely
tide
of
radiance
he
moved
toward
her
and
looked
down
into
the
trench
where
she
waited
swiftly
he
kicked
off
his
snowshoes
and
leaped
down
beside
her
the
gleam
of
tears
was
in
her
eyes
as
she
held
out
both
hands
to
him
during
the
long
look
they
gave
each
other
something
wonderful
to
both
of
them
was
born
into
the
world
when
he
tried
to
speak
his
hoarse
voice
broke
sheba
little
sheba
safe
after
all
thank
god
you
you
he
swallowed
the
lump
in
his
throat
and
tried
again
if
you
knew
god
how
i
have
suffered
i
was
afraid
i
dared
not
let
myself
think
a
live
pulse
beat
in
her
white
throat
the
tears
brimmed
over
then
somehow
she
was
in
his
arms
weeping
her
eyes
slowly
turned
to
his
and
he
met
the
touch
of
her
surrendered
lips
nature
had
brought
them
together
by
one
of
her
resistless
and
unpremeditated
impulses
chapter
xxvii
two
on
the
trail
a
stress
of
emotion
had
swept
her
into
his
arms
now
she
drew
away
from
him
shyly
the
conventions
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
asserted
themselves
sheba
remembered
that
they
had
been
carried
by
the
high
wave
of
their
emotion
past
all
the
usual
preliminaries
he
had
not
even
told
her
that
he
loved
her
an
absurd
little
fear
obtruded
itself
into
her
happiness
had
she
rushed
into
his
arms
like
a
lovesick
girl
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
cared
for
her
you
came
to
look
for
us
she
asked
with
the
little
shy
stiffness
of
embarrassment
for
you
yes
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
bird
was
singing
in
his
heart
the
gladness
he
could
not
express
he
had
for
many
hours
pushed
from
his
mind
pictures
of
her
lying
white
and
rigid
on
the
snow
instead
she
stood
beside
him
her
delicate
beauty
vivid
as
the
flush
of
a
flame
did
they
telephone
that
we
were
lost
yes
i
was
troubled
when
the
storm
grew
i
could
not
sleep
so
i
called
up
the
roadhouse
by
long
distance
they
had
not
heard
from
the
stage
later
i
called
again
when
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
started
not
on
foot
no
with
holt
dog
team
he
is
back
there
his
leg
is
broken
a
crushed
him
this
morning
where
we
camped
bring
him
to
the
cabin
i
will
tell
the
others
you
are
coming
have
you
had
any
food
he
asked
a
tired
smile
lit
up
the
shadows
of
weariness
under
her
soft
dark
eyes
boiled
oats
plum
pudding
and
chocolates
she
told
him
we
have
plenty
of
food
on
the
sled
i
bring
it
at
once
she
nodded
and
turned
to
go
to
the
cabin
he
watched
for
a
moment
the
lilt
in
her
walk
an
expression
from
his
reading
jumped
to
his
mind
melodious
feet
some
poet
had
said
that
had
he
surely
it
must
have
been
sheba
of
whom
he
was
thinking
this
girl
so
virginal
of
body
and
of
mind
free
and
as
a
caribou
on
the
hills
gordon
returned
to
the
sled
and
drove
the
team
up
the
draw
to
the
cabin
the
three
who
had
been
marooned
came
to
meet
their
rescuer
you
must
come
right
through
the
storm
lickitty
split
swiftwater
said
you
right
we
did
this
side
pardner
of
mine
was
on
wrestling
with
a
blizzard
holt
answered
dryly
sorry
you
broke
your
laig
gid
then
there
two
of
us
sorry
swiftwater
it
one
of
the
best
laigs
i
got
sheba
turned
to
the
old
miner
impulsively
if
you
could
be
knowing
what
i
am
thinking
of
you
holt
how
full
our
hearts
are
of
the
gratitude
she
stopped
tears
in
her
voice
sho
no
need
of
that
miss
he
dragged
me
along
his
thumb
jerked
toward
the
man
who
was
driving
i
seen
better
dog
punchers
than
elliot
but
he
got
the
world
beat
at
routin
out
of
bed
and
persuadin
them
to
kick
in
with
him
and
buck
a
blizzard
me
o
course
i
an
old
fool
for
comin
the
dark
eyes
of
the
girl
were
like
stars
in
a
frosty
night
then
you
the
kind
of
a
fool
i
love
holt
i
think
it
was
just
fine
of
you
and
i
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
live
olson
had
cooked
too
long
in
lumber
and
mining
camps
not
to
know
something
about
under
her
direction
gordon
made
splints
and
helped
her
bandage
the
broken
leg
meanwhile
swiftwater
pete
fed
his
horses
from
the
grain
on
the
sled
and
sheba
cooked
an
appetizing
breakfast
the
aroma
of
coffee
and
the
smell
of
frying
bacon
stimulated
appetites
that
needed
no
tempting
holt
propped
up
by
blankets
ate
with
the
others
for
a
good
many
years
he
had
taken
his
luck
as
it
came
with
philosophic
endurance
now
he
wasted
no
time
in
mourning
what
could
not
be
helped
he
was
lucky
the
ice
slide
had
not
hit
him
in
the
head
a
broken
leg
would
mend
while
they
ate
the
party
went
into
committee
of
the
whole
to
decide
what
was
best
to
be
done
gordon
noticed
that
in
all
the
tentative
suggestions
made
by
holt
and
swiftwater
the
comfort
of
sheba
was
the
first
thing
in
mind
the
girl
too
noticed
it
and
smilingly
protested
her
soft
hand
lying
for
the
moment
on
the
gnarled
one
of
the
old
miner
it
does
matter
about
me
we
have
to
think
of
what
will
be
best
for
holt
of
how
to
get
him
to
the
proper
care
my
comfort
can
wait
the
plan
at
last
decided
upon
was
that
gordon
should
make
a
dash
for
smith
crossing
on
snowshoes
where
he
was
to
arrange
for
a
relief
party
to
come
out
for
the
injured
man
and
olson
he
was
to
return
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
rescuers
next
morning
he
and
sheba
would
start
with
holt
dog
team
for
kusiak
macdonald
had
taught
sheba
how
to
use
snowshoes
and
she
had
been
an
apt
pupil
from
her
suitcase
she
got
out
her
moccasins
and
put
them
on
she
borrowed
the
snowshoes
of
holt
wrapped
herself
in
her
parka
and
announced
that
she
was
going
with
elliot
part
of
the
way
gordon
thought
her
movements
a
miracle
of
supple
lightness
her
lines
had
the
swelling
roundness
of
vital
youth
her
eyes
were
alive
with
the
eagerness
that
time
dulls
in
most
faces
they
spoke
little
as
they
swept
forward
over
the
white
the
spell
of
the
great
north
was
over
her
its
mystery
was
stirring
in
her
heart
just
as
it
had
been
when
her
lips
had
turned
to
his
at
the
sunrise
as
for
him
love
ran
through
his
veins
like
old
wine
but
he
allowed
his
feelings
no
expression
for
though
she
had
come
to
him
of
her
own
accord
for
that
one
blessed
minute
at
dawn
he
could
not
be
sure
what
had
moved
her
so
deeply
she
was
treading
a
world
primeval
the
wonder
of
it
still
in
her
soft
eyes
would
she
waken
to
love
or
to
disillusion
he
took
care
to
see
that
she
did
not
tire
presently
he
stopped
and
held
out
his
hand
to
say
will
you
come
back
this
way
she
asked
yes
i
ought
to
get
here
soon
after
dark
will
you
meet
me
she
gave
him
a
quick
shy
little
nod
turned
without
shaking
hands
and
struck
out
for
the
cabin
all
through
the
day
happiness
flooded
her
heart
while
she
waited
on
holt
or
helped
olson
cook
or
watched
swiftwater
while
he
put
up
the
tent
in
the
lee
of
the
cabin
little
snatches
of
song
bubbled
from
her
lips
sometimes
they
were
bits
of
old
irish
ballads
that
popped
into
her
mind
once
while
she
was
preparing
some
coffee
for
her
patient
it
was
a
stanza
from
burns
till
a
the
seas
gang
dry
my
dear
and
the
rocks
melt
wi
the
sun
i
will
luve
thee
still
my
dear
while
the
sands
o
life
shall
run
she
caught
old
gideon
looking
at
her
with
a
queer
little
smile
on
his
face
and
she
felt
the
color
beat
into
her
cheeks
i
have
bought
a
wedding
present
for
twenty
years
he
told
her
presently
apropos
of
nothing
that
had
been
said
i
wo
know
the
proper
thing
to
get
miss
sheba
if
you
talk
nonsense
like
that
i
go
out
and
talk
to
swiftwater
pete
she
threatened
blushing
old
gid
folded
his
hands
meekly
i
be
good
honest
i
will
see
i
got
to
make
safe
and
sane
conversation
have
i
hm
wonder
when
that
lazy
horsethief
and
holdup
that
calls
himself
gordon
elliot
will
get
back
to
camp
sheba
looked
into
his
twinkling
eyes
suspiciously
as
she
handed
him
his
coffee
for
a
moment
she
bit
her
lip
to
keep
back
a
smile
then
said
with
mock
severity
now
i
going
to
leave
you
to
mrs
olson
when
sunset
came
it
found
sheba
on
the
trail
swiftwater
pete
had
offered
to
go
with
her
but
she
had
been
relieved
of
his
kindness
by
the
demand
of
holt
no
you
do
pete
you
ai
off
gallivantin
with
no
young
lady
you
to
stay
here
and
fix
my
game
laig
for
me
what
do
you
reckon
miss
sheba
wants
with
a
fat
lummox
like
you
along
with
her
pete
grew
purple
with
embarrassment
he
had
not
intended
anything
more
than
civility
and
he
wanted
this
understood
hmp
ai
you
got
no
sense
gid
if
miss
sheba
on
goin
to
meet
elliot
i
allowed
some
one
ought
to
go
along
and
keep
the
dark
offen
her
there
ai
nothin
going
to
harm
her
unless
she
goes
and
gets
lost
sheba
smile
cooled
the
heat
of
the
which
she
going
to
do
good
of
you
to
offer
to
go
with
me
do
mind
holt
everybody
knows
he
does
mean
half
of
what
he
says
i
be
glad
to
have
you
come
with
me
but
it
is
necessary
at
all
so
i
not
trouble
you
darkness
fell
quickly
but
sheba
still
held
to
the
trail
there
was
no
sign
of
elliot
but
she
felt
sure
he
would
come
soon
meanwhile
she
followed
steadily
the
tracks
he
had
made
earlier
in
the
day
she
stopped
at
last
it
was
getting
much
colder
she
was
miles
from
the
camp
reluctantly
she
decided
to
return
then
out
of
the
darkness
he
came
abruptly
upon
her
the
man
whom
she
had
come
out
to
meet
under
the
magic
of
the
northern
stars
they
found
themselves
again
in
each
other
arms
for
that
brief
moment
of
joyful
surprise
then
as
it
had
been
in
the
morning
sheba
drew
herself
shyly
away
they
are
waiting
supper
for
us
she
told
him
irrelevantly
he
did
not
shout
out
his
happiness
and
tell
her
to
let
them
wait
for
gordon
too
felt
awed
at
this
wonderful
adventure
of
love
that
had
befallen
them
it
was
enough
for
him
that
they
were
moving
side
by
side
alone
in
the
deep
snows
and
the
biting
cold
that
waves
of
emotion
crashed
through
his
pulses
when
his
swinging
hand
touched
hers
they
were
acutely
conscious
of
each
other
excitement
burned
in
the
eyes
that
turned
to
swift
reluctant
meetings
she
was
a
woman
and
he
was
her
lover
neither
of
them
dared
quite
accept
the
fact
yet
but
it
filled
the
background
of
all
their
thoughts
with
delight
sheba
did
not
want
to
talk
of
this
new
amazing
thing
that
had
come
into
her
life
it
was
too
sacred
a
subject
to
discuss
just
yet
even
with
him
so
she
began
to
tell
him
odd
fancies
from
childhood
that
lingered
in
her
celtic
heart
tales
of
the
little
folk
that
were
half
memories
and
half
imaginings
stirred
to
life
by
some
odd
association
of
sky
and
stars
she
laughed
softly
at
herself
as
she
told
them
but
gordon
did
not
laugh
at
her
everything
she
did
was
for
him
divinely
done
even
when
his
eyes
were
on
the
dark
trail
ahead
he
saw
only
the
dusky
loveliness
of
curved
cheek
the
face
luminous
with
a
radiance
some
women
are
never
privileged
to
know
the
rhythm
of
head
and
body
and
slender
legs
that
was
part
of
her
individual
charm
the
rest
had
finished
supper
before
gordon
and
sheba
reached
camp
but
olson
had
a
hot
meal
waiting
for
them
i
fixed
up
the
tent
for
the
women
folks
stove
plenty
of
wood
touch
a
match
to
the
fire
and
it
be
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
explained
swiftwater
to
gordon
elliot
and
sheba
were
to
start
early
for
kusiak
and
later
the
rescue
party
would
arrive
to
take
care
of
holt
and
olson
time
to
turn
in
holt
advised
you
better
light
that
stove
elliot
the
young
man
was
still
in
the
tent
arranging
the
when
sheba
entered
he
tried
to
walk
out
without
touching
her
intending
to
call
back
his
but
he
could
not
do
it
there
was
something
flamey
about
her
that
went
to
his
head
her
tender
tremulous
little
smile
and
the
turn
of
the
buoyant
little
head
stirred
in
him
a
lover
rhapsody
it
to
be
a
long
trail
we
cover
sheba
you
must
sleep
gordon
there
was
a
little
flash
of
audacity
in
the
whimsical
twist
of
her
mouth
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
called
him
by
his
given
name
elliot
threw
away
prudence
and
caught
her
by
the
hands
my
dear
my
dear
he
cried
she
trembled
to
his
kiss
gave
herself
to
his
embrace
with
innocent
passion
tendrils
of
hair
fine
as
silk
brushed
his
cheeks
and
sent
strange
thrills
through
him
they
talked
the
incoherent
language
of
lovers
that
is
compounded
of
murmurs
and
silences
and
the
touch
of
lips
and
the
meetings
of
eyes
there
were
to
be
other
nights
in
their
lives
as
rich
in
memories
as
this
but
never
another
with
quite
the
same
delight
presently
sheba
reminded
him
with
a
smile
of
the
long
trail
he
had
mentioned
olson
bustled
into
the
tent
and
her
presence
stressed
the
point
neighbors
gordon
called
back
from
outside
the
tent
sheba
echoed
softly
back
to
him
the
girl
fell
asleep
to
the
sound
of
the
light
breeze
slapping
the
tent
and
to
the
doleful
howling
of
the
huskies
chapter
xxviii
a
message
from
the
dead
macdonald
drove
his
team
into
the
teeth
of
the
storm
the
wind
came
in
gusts
sometimes
the
gale
was
so
stiff
that
the
dogs
could
scarcely
crawl
forward
against
it
again
there
were
moments
of
comparative
stillness
followed
by
squalls
that
slapped
the
driver
in
the
face
like
the
whipping
of
a
loose
sail
on
a
catboat
high
drifts
made
the
trail
difficult
not
once
but
fifty
times
macdonald
left
the
to
break
a
way
through
for
the
sled
the
best
he
could
get
out
of
his
dogs
was
three
miles
an
hour
and
he
knew
that
there
was
not
another
team
or
driver
in
the
north
could
have
done
so
well
it
was
close
to
noon
when
he
reached
a
division
of
the
road
known
as
the
fork
one
trail
ran
down
to
the
river
and
up
it
to
the
distant
creeks
the
other
led
across
the
divide
struck
the
yukon
and
pointed
a
way
to
the
coast
white
drifts
had
long
since
blotted
out
the
track
of
the
sled
that
had
preceded
him
had
the
fugitives
gone
up
the
river
to
the
creeks
with
intent
to
hole
themselves
up
for
the
winter
or
was
it
their
purpose
to
cross
the
divide
and
go
out
over
the
ice
to
the
coast
the
pursuer
knew
that
gid
holt
was
wise
as
a
weasel
he
could
follow
blindfolded
the
paths
that
led
to
every
creek
in
the
it
might
be
taken
as
a
certainty
that
he
had
not
plunged
into
such
a
desperate
venture
without
having
a
plan
well
worked
out
beforehand
elliot
had
a
high
grade
of
intelligence
would
they
try
to
reach
the
coast
and
make
their
to
seattle
or
would
they
dig
themselves
in
till
the
heavy
snows
were
past
and
come
back
to
civilization
with
the
story
of
a
lucky
strike
to
account
for
the
gold
they
brought
with
them
neither
nor
nuggets
could
be
identified
there
would
be
no
way
of
proving
the
story
false
the
only
evidence
against
them
would
be
that
they
had
left
at
kusiak
and
this
was
merely
of
a
corroborative
kind
there
would
be
no
chance
of
convicting
them
upon
it
but
to
strike
for
seattle
was
to
throw
away
all
pretense
of
innocence
fugitives
from
justice
they
would
have
to
disappear
from
sight
in
order
to
escape
the
hunt
for
them
would
continue
until
at
last
they
were
unearthed
one
fork
of
the
road
led
to
comparative
safety
the
other
went
by
devious
windings
to
the
penitentiary
and
perhaps
the
gallows
the
scotchman
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
men
he
was
trailing
given
the
same
conditions
he
knew
which
path
he
would
follow
macdonald
took
the
trail
that
led
down
to
the
river
to
the
distant
which
offered
a
refuge
from
in
many
a
deserted
cabin
marooned
by
the
deep
snows
even
the
iron
frame
and
steel
muscles
of
the
protested
against
the
task
he
had
set
them
that
day
it
was
a
time
to
sit
snugly
inside
by
a
stove
and
listen
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
as
it
hurled
itself
down
from
the
divide
but
from
daylight
till
dark
colby
macdonald
fought
with
drifts
and
breasted
the
storm
he
got
into
the
harness
with
the
dogs
he
broke
trail
for
them
cheered
them
soothed
comforted
punished
long
after
night
had
fallen
he
staggered
into
the
hut
of
two
prospectors
his
parka
so
stiff
with
frozen
snow
that
it
had
to
be
beaten
with
a
hammer
before
the
coat
could
be
removed
how
long
since
a
dog
team
passed
seven
huskies
and
two
men
was
his
first
question
no
dog
team
has
passed
for
four
days
one
of
the
men
answered
you
mean
you
have
seen
one
macdonald
corrected
i
mean
none
has
passed
unless
it
went
by
in
the
night
while
we
slept
and
even
then
our
dogs
would
have
warned
us
macdonald
flung
his
gloves
to
a
table
and
stooped
to
take
off
his
mukluks
his
face
was
blue
with
the
cold
but
the
bleak
look
in
the
eyes
came
from
within
he
said
nothing
more
until
he
was
free
of
his
wet
clothes
then
he
sat
down
heavily
and
passed
a
hand
over
his
frozen
eyebrows
get
me
something
to
eat
and
take
care
of
my
dogs
there
is
food
for
them
on
the
sled
he
said
while
he
ate
he
told
them
of
the
bank
robbery
and
the
murder
their
resentment
against
the
men
who
had
done
it
was
quite
genuine
there
could
be
no
doubt
they
told
the
truth
when
they
said
no
sled
had
preceded
his
they
were
honest
reliable
prospectors
he
knew
them
both
well
the
weary
man
slept
like
a
log
he
opened
his
eyes
next
morning
to
find
one
of
his
hosts
shaking
him
six
macdonald
your
breakfast
is
ready
jim
is
looking
out
for
the
huskies
half
an
hour
later
the
scotchman
gave
the
order
mush
he
was
off
again
this
time
on
the
back
trail
as
far
as
the
narrows
from
which
point
he
meant
to
strike
across
to
intersect
the
fork
of
the
road
leading
to
the
divide
the
storm
had
passed
and
when
the
late
sun
rose
it
was
in
a
blue
sky
fine
enough
the
day
was
overhead
but
the
slushy
snow
where
it
was
worn
thin
on
the
river
by
the
sweep
of
the
wind
made
heavy
travel
for
the
dogs
macdonald
was
glad
enough
to
reach
the
narrows
where
he
could
turn
from
the
river
and
cut
across
to
hit
the
trail
of
the
men
he
was
following
he
had
about
five
miles
to
go
before
he
would
reach
the
smith
crossing
road
and
every
foot
of
it
he
would
have
to
break
trail
for
the
dogs
this
was
slow
business
since
he
had
no
partner
at
the
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
he
trudged
beating
down
the
loose
snow
for
the
runners
it
was
a
hill
trail
and
the
drifts
were
in
most
places
not
very
deep
but
the
scotchman
was
doing
the
work
of
two
and
at
a
killing
pace
over
a
ridge
the
team
plunged
down
into
a
little
park
where
the
snow
was
deeper
macdonald
breaking
trail
across
the
mountain
valley
found
his
feet
weighted
with
packed
ice
slush
so
that
he
could
hardly
move
them
when
at
last
he
had
beaten
down
a
path
for
his
dogs
he
stood
breathing
deep
at
the
summit
of
the
slope
before
him
lay
the
main
road
to
crossing
scarce
fifty
yards
away
he
gave
a
deep
whoop
of
triumph
for
along
it
ran
the
wavering
tracks
left
by
a
sled
he
was
on
the
heels
of
his
enemy
at
last
as
he
turned
back
to
his
siberian
hounds
the
eyes
of
macdonald
came
to
abrupt
attention
on
the
hillside
not
ten
yards
from
him
something
stuck
out
of
the
snow
like
a
signpost
it
was
the
foot
of
a
man
slowly
macdonald
moved
toward
it
he
knew
well
enough
what
he
had
stumbled
across
one
of
the
tragedies
that
in
the
north
are
likely
to
be
found
in
the
wake
of
every
widespread
blizzard
some
unfortunate
traveler
blinded
by
the
white
swirl
had
wandered
from
the
trail
and
had
staggered
up
a
draw
to
his
death
with
a
little
digging
the
alaskan
uncovered
a
leg
the
man
had
died
where
he
had
fallen
face
down
macdonald
scooped
away
the
snow
and
found
a
pack
strapped
to
the
back
of
the
buried
man
he
cut
the
thongs
and
tried
to
ease
it
away
but
the
gunnysack
had
frozen
to
the
parka
when
he
pulled
the
rotten
sacking
gave
way
under
the
strain
the
contents
of
the
pack
spilled
out
the
eyes
in
the
grim
face
of
macdonald
grew
hard
and
steely
he
had
found
by
some
strange
freak
of
chance
much
more
than
he
had
expected
to
find
using
his
snowshoe
as
a
shovel
he
dug
the
body
free
and
turned
it
over
at
sight
of
the
face
he
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment

do

him

touch
him
gordon
overslept
his
plan
had
been
to
reach
kusiak
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
travel
but
that
had
meant
getting
on
the
trail
with
the
first
gleam
of
light
when
he
opened
his
eyes
olson
was
calling
him
to
rise
he
dressed
and
stepped
out
into
the
cold
crisp
morning
from
the
hill
crotch
the
sun
was
already
pouring
down
a
great
fanlike
shaft
of
light
across
the
snow
vista
swiftwater
pete
passed
behind
him
on
his
way
to
the
stable
and
called
a
cheerful
in
his
direction
olson
had
put
the
stove
outside
the
tent
and
gordon
lifted
it
to
the
spot
where
they
did
the
cooking
neighbor
he
called
to
sheba
sleep
well
the
little
rustling
sounds
within
the
tent
ceased
a
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
flaps
drawn
discreetly
close
beneath
the
chin
never
better
is
my
breakfast
ready
yet
come
and
help
me
make
it
olson
is
waiting
on
holt
when
i
dressed
the
smiling
face
disappeared
dublin
bay
sounded
in
her
fresh
young
voice
from
the
tent
gordon
joined
in
the
song
as
he
lit
the
fire
and
sliced
bacon
from
a
frozen
slab
of
it
the
howling
of
the
huskies
interrupted
the
song
they
had
evidently
heard
something
that
excited
them
gordon
listened
was
it
in
his
fancy
only
that
the
breeze
carried
to
him
the
faint
jingle
of
the
sound
if
it
was
one
died
away
the
cook
turned
to
his
job
he
stopped
sawing
at
the
meat
knife
and
bacon
both
suspended
in
the
air
on
the
hard
snow
there
had
come
to
him
the
crunch
of
a
foot
behind
him
whose
sheba
was
in
the
tent
swiftwater
at
the
stable
olson
in
the
house
slowly
he
turned
his
head
what
elliot
saw
sent
the
starch
through
his
body
he
did
not
move
an
inch
still
sat
crouched
by
the
fire
but
every
nerve
was
at
tension
every
muscle
taut
for
he
was
looking
at
a
rifle
lying
negligently
in
brown
steady
hands
they
were
very
sure
hands
very
competent
ones
he
knew
that
because
he
had
seen
them
in
action
the
owner
of
the
hands
was
colby
macdonald
the
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
willow
grove
his
face
was
grim
as
the
day
of
judgment
do
move
he
ordered
elliot
laughed
irritably
he
was
both
annoyed
and
disgusted
what
do
you
want
he
snapped
you
what
worrying
you
now
do
you
think
i
jumping
my
bond
you
going
back
to
kusiak
with
me
to
give
a
life
for
the
one
you
took
what
that
cried
gordon
surprised
just
as
i
telling
you
i
been
on
your
heels
ever
since
you
left
town
you
and
holt
are
going
back
with
me
as
my
prisoners
but
what
for
for
robbing
the
bank
and
murdering
robert
milton
as
you
know
well
enough
is
this
another
plant
arranged
for
me
by
you
and
selfridge
demanded
elliot
macdonald
ignored
the
question
and
lifted
his
voice
come
out
of
that
tent
holt
and
come
with
your
hands
up
unless
you
want
your
head
blown
off
holt
is
in
that
tent
you
damned
idiot
if
you
want
to
know
come
if
you
expect
to
come
alive
cut
in
the
scotchman
ominously
he
raised
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
covered
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
sun
on
the
figure
within
gordon
flung
out
a
wild
protest
and
threw
the
frozen
slab
of
bacon
at
the
head
of
macdonald
with
the
same
motion
he
launched
his
own
body
across
the
stove
a
fifth
of
a
second
earlier
the
tent
flap
had
opened
and
sheba
had
come
out
the
sight
of
her
paralyzed
macdonald
and
saved
her
lover
life
it
distracted
the
long
enough
for
him
to
miss
his
chance
a
bullet
struck
the
stove
and
went
off
at
a
tangent
through
the
tent
canvas
not
two
feet
from
where
sheba
stood
a
second
went
speeding
toward
the
sun
for
gordon
had
followed
the
football
player
instinct
and
dived
for
the
knees
of
his
enemy
they
went
down
together
each
squirming
for
the
upper
place
they
rolled
over
and
over
the
rifle
was
forgotten
like
cave
men
they
fought
crushing
and
twisting
each
other
muscles
with
the
blind
lust
of
primordials
to
kill
as
they
clinched
with
one
arm
they
struck
savagely
with
the
other
the
impact
of
smashing
blows
on
naked
flesh
sounded
horribly
cruel
to
sheba
she
ran
forward
calling
on
each
by
name
to
stop
probably
neither
knew
she
was
there
their
whole
attention
was
focused
on
each
other
not
for
an
instant
did
their
eyes
wander
for
life
and
death
hung
on
the
issue
chance
had
lit
the
spark
of
their
resentment
but
passions
were
blazing
fiercely
now
they
got
to
their
feet
and
fought
toe
to
toe
blows
beat
upon
bleeding
and
disfigured
faces
no
thought
of
defense
as
yet
was
in
the
mind
of
either
the
purpose
of
each
was
to
bruise
maim
make
helpless
the
other
but
for
the
impotent
little
cries
of
sheba
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
save
the
crunch
of
their
feet
on
the
hard
snow
the
thud
of
heavy
fists
on
flesh
and
the
throaty
snarl
of
their
deep
irregular
breathing
gid
holt
from
the
window
of
the

macdonald
had
slipped
on
the
snow
and
gone
down
to
his
hands
and
knees
swift
as
a
wildcat
the
younger
man
was
on
top
of
him
hampered
though
he
was
by
his
parka
the
scotchman
struggled
slowly
to
his
feet
again
he
was
much
the
heavier
man
and
in
spite
of
his
years
the
stronger
the
muscles
stood
out
in
knots
on
his
shoulders
and
across
his
back
whereas
on
the
body
of
his
more
slender
opponent
they
flowed
and
rippled
in
rounded
symmetry
active
as
a
heather
cat
elliot
was
far
the
quicker
of
the
two
by
the
hammering
he
had
received
gordon
changed
his
method
of
fighting
he
broke
away
from
the
clinch
and
sidestepped
the
rush
of
his
foe
covering
up
as
well
as
he
could
from
the
onset
macdonald
pressed
the
attack
and
was
beaten
back
by
hard
straight
lefts
and
rights
to
the
unprotected
face
the
shook
the
matted
hair
from
his
swollen
eyes
and
rushed
again
he
caught
an
uppercut
flush
on
the
end
of
the
chin
it
did
not
even
stop
him
the
weight
of
his
body
was
in
the
blow
he
lashed
up
from
his
side
the
knees
of
elliot
doubled
up
under
him
like
the
blade
of
a
jackknife
he
sank
down
slowly
turned
got
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
tried
to
shake
off
the
tons
of
weight
that
seemed
to
be
holding
him
down
macdonald
seized
him
about
the
waist
and
flung
him
to
the
ground
upon
the
inert
body
the
victor
dropped
his
knees
clinching
the
torso
of
the
unconscious
man
now
pete
go
to
him
urged
holt
wildly
but
before
swiftwater
could
move
before
the
great
fist
of
macdonald
could
smash
down
upon
the
bleeding
face
upturned
to
his
a
sharp
blow
struck
the
flesh
of
the
raised
forearm
and
for
the
moment
stunned
the
muscles
the
lifted
a
countenance
drunk
with
rage
slowly
the
light
of
reason
came
back
into
his
eyes
sheba
was
standing
before
him
his
rifle
in
her
hand
she
had
struck
him
with
the
butt
of
it
do
touch
him
do
you
dare
touch
him
she
challenged
he
looked
at
her
long
then
let
his
eyes
fall
to
the
battered
face
of
his
enemy
drunkenly
he
got
to
his
feet
and
leaned
against
a
willow
his
forces
were
spent
his
muscles
weighted
as
with
lead
but
it
was
not
this
alone
that
made
his
breath
come
short
and
raggedly
sheba
had
flung
herself
down
beside
her
lover
she
had
caught
him
tightly
in
her
arms
so
that
his
disfigured
face
lay
against
her
warm
bosom
in
the
eyes
lifted
to
those
of
the
was
an
unconquerable
defiance
he
mine
mine
you
murderer
she
panted
fiercely
if
you
kill
him
you
must
kill
me
first
the
man
she
had
once
promised
to
marry
was
looking
at
a
different
woman
from
the
girl
he
had
known
the
soft
shy
youth
of
her
was
gone
she
was
a
forest
mother
of
the
wilds
ready
to
fight
for
her
young
a
wife
ready
to
go
to
the
stake
for
the
husband
of
her
choice
an
emotion
primitive
and
poignant
had
transformed
her
his
eyes
burned
at
her
the
question
his
parched
lips
and
throat
could
scarcely
utter
so
you
love
him
but
though
it
was
in
form
a
question
he
knew
already
the
answer
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
began
to
taste
the
bitterness
of
defeat
always
he
had
won
what
he
coveted
by
brutal
force
or
his
stark
will
but
it
was
beyond
him
to
compel
the
love
of
a
girl
who
had
given
her
heart
to
another
yes
she
answered
her
hair
in
two
thick
braids
was
flung
across
her
shoulders
her
dark
head
thrown
back
proudly
from
the
rounded
throat
macdonald
smiled
but
there
was
no
mirth
in
his
savage
eyes
do
you
know
what
i
want
with
him
why
i
have
come
to
get
him
no
i
come
to
take
him
back
to
kusiak
to
be
hanged
because
he
murdered
milton
the
bank
cashier
the
eyes
of
the
woman
blazed
at
him
are
you
mad
it
the
truth
macdonald
voice
was
curt
and
harsh
he
and
holt
were
robbing
the
bank
when
milton
came
back
from
the
dance
at
the
club
the
cowards
shot
down
the
old
man
like
a
dog
they
hang
for
it
if
it
costs
me
my
last
penny
so
help
me
god
you
say
it
the
truth
she
retorted
scornfully
do
you
think
i
know
you
now
how
you
twist
and
distort
facts
to
suit
your
ends
how
long
is
it
since
your
jackal
had
him
arrested
for
assaulting
you
when
wally
selfridge
knew
and
you
knew
that
he
had
risked
his
life
for
you
and
had
saved
yours
by
bringing
you
to
diane
after
he
had
bandaged
your
wounds
that
was
different
it
was
part
of
the
game
of
politics
we
were
playing
you
admit
that
you
and
your
friends
lied
then
is
it
like
you
could
persuade
me
that
you
telling
the
truth
now
the
big
alaskan
shrugged
believe
it
or
not
as
you
like
anyhow
going
back
with
me
to
kusiak
and
holt
too
if

here
an
excited
cackle
cut
into
the
conversation
followed
by
a
drawling
announcement
from
the

macdonald
whirled
in
his
tracks
old
gid
holt
was
leaning
on
his
elbow
with
his
head
out
of
the
window
you

but
i
too
crippled

crippled
to
go

to
kusiak
with
me
if
you
walk
you
ride
but
back
you
go
fine
i
been
worrying
about
how
to
get
there
it
right
good
of
you
to
bring
one
of
these
here
taxis
for
me
as
the
old
sayin
is
where
is
the
rest
of
the
gold
you
stole
i
ai
seen
the
latest
papers
mac
what
is
this
stuff
about
robbin
a
bank
and
shootin
milton
you
under
arrest
for
robbery
and
murder
am
i
unload
the
particulars
when
did
i
do
it
all
you
know
when
just
before
you
left
town
holt
shook
his
head
slowly
no
sir
i
ca
seem
to
remember
it
sure
it
ai
some
one
else
you
thinking
about
howcome
you
to
fix
on
me
as
one
of
the
bold
bad
bandits
because
you
had
not
sense
enough
to
cover
your
tracks
you
might
just
as
well
have
left
a
note
saying
you
did
it
first
you
come
to
town
and
buy
one
of
the
fastest
dog
teams
in
alaska
why
that
an
easy
one
i
bought
that
team
to
win
the
alaska
sweepstakes
from
you
and
i
goin
to
do
it
the
team
was
handled
right
or
it
would
have
won
last
time
i
got
to
millin
it
over
and
figured
that
old
gid
holt
was
the
dog
puncher
that
could
land
those
huskies
in
front
see
you
bought
it
to
make
your
getaway
after
the
robbery
retorted
macdonald
it
a
difference
of
opinion
makes
what
else
have
you
got
against
us
we
found
in
your
room
one
of
the
sacks
that
had
held
the
gold
you
took
from
the
bank
that
right
i
took
it
from
the
bank
in
the
afternoon
where
i
had
had
it
on
deposit
to
pay
for
the
team
i
bought
milton
books
will
show
that
but
you
did
find
any
sack
i
took
when
your
bank
was
robbed
if
it
was
robbed
added
the
old
man
significantly
of
course
i
knew
you
would
have
an
alibi
have
you
got
one
to
explain
why
you
left
town
so
suddenly
the
night
the
bank
was
robbed
milton
was
killed
after
midnight
before
morning
you
and
your
friend
elliot
routed
out
ackroyd
and
bought
a
lot
of
supplies
from
him
for
a
trip
you
slipped
around
to
the
corral
and
hit
the
trail
right
into
the
blizzard
will
you
tell
me
why
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
if
it
was
to
escape
from
the
town
where
you
had
murdered
a
decent
old
fellow
who
never
had
harmed
a
soul
sure
i
tell
you
the
black
eyes
of
the
little
man
snapped
eagerly
i
came
so
because
that
side
pardner
of
mine
gordon
elliot
would
let
me
wait
till
mornin
he
had
a
reason
for
leavin
town
that
would
wait
a
minute
one
big
enough
to
drive
him
right
into
the
heart
of
the
blizzard
me
i
tagged
along
i
can
guess
his
reason
jeered
the
scotchman
but
i
like
to
hear
you
put
a
name
to
it
holt
grinned
maliciously
and
waved
a
hand
toward
the
girl
who
was
pillowing
the
head
of
her
lover
the
name
of
his
reason
is
sheba
but
it
goin
to
be
sheba
elliot
soon
looks
like
you
mean
the
little
miner
took
the
words
triumphantly
out
of
his
mouth
he
leaned
forward
and
threw
them
into
the
face
of
the
man
he
hated
i
mean
that
while
you
was
dancin
and
philanderin
with
other
women
gordon
elliot
was
buckin
a
blizzard
to
save
the
life
of
the
girl
you
both
claimed
to
love
he
was
mushin
into
fifty
miles
of
frozen
hell
while
you
was
fillin
up
with
potted
grouse
and
champagne
simultaneous
with
the
lame
goose
and
the
monkey
singlestep
you
was
doin
this
lad
was
through
white
drifts
he
beat
you
at
your
own
game
man
you
a
bear
for
the
outdoor
stuff
they
tell
me
you
chew
up
a
blizzard
for
breakfast
and
throttle
a
pack
of
wolves
to
work
up
an
appetite
for
dinner
it
your
specialty
all
right
take
your
hat
off
to
that
chechacko
who
has
just
whaled
you
blind
he
has
outgamed
you
colby
macdonald
you
do
run
in
his
class
i
see
he
is
holding
his
haid
up
again
give
him
another
and
he
be
ready
to
go
to
the
mat
with
you
again
the
big
alaskan
pushed
away
a
fear
that
had
been
lingering
in
his
mind
ever
since
he
had
stumbled
on
that
body
buried
in
the
snow
yesterday
afternoon
was
his
enemy
going
to
escape
him
after
all
could
holt
be
telling
the
true
reason
why
they
had
left
town
so
hurriedly
he
would
not
let
himself
believe
it
you
ought
to
work
up
a
better
story
than
that
he
said
contemptuously
you
can
throw
a
husky
through
the
holes
in
it
how
could
elliot
know
for
instance
that
miss
was
not
safe
the
same
way
you
could
a
known
it
snapped
old
gideon
he
to
smith
crossin
and
found
the
stage
had
got
in
and
that
there
was
a
hell
of
a
storm
up
in
the
hills
macdonald
set
his
face
you
lying
to
me
you
stumbled
over
the
stage
while
you
were
making
your
getaway
now
you
playing
it
for
an
alibi
elliot
had
risen
sheba
stood
beside
him
her
hand
in
his
she
spoke
quietly
it
the
truth
believe
it
or
not
as
you
please
we
care
nothing
about
that
the
stab
of
her
eyes
the
carriage
of
the
slim
pliant
figure
with
its
suggestion
of
fine
gallantry
challenged
her
former
lover
to
do
his
worst
on
the
battered
face
of
gordon
was
a
smile
so
long
as
his
irish
sweetheart
stood
by
him
he
did
not
care
if
he
were
charged
with
high
treason
it
was
worth
all
it
cost
to
feel
the
warmth
of
her
brave
impulsive
trust
the
eyes
of
macdonald
clinched
with
those
of
his
rival
you
cached
the
rest
of
the
gold
i
suppose
he
said
doggedly
with
a
lift
of
his
shoulders
the
younger
man
answered
lightly
there
are
none
so
blind
as
those
who
will
not
see
mr
macdonald
he
turned
to
sheba
come
we
must
make
breakfast
you
going
to
kusiak
with
me
his
enemy
said
bluntly
after
we
have
eaten
macdonald
returned
elliot
with
an
ironic
bow
perhaps
if
you
have
not
had
breakfast
yet
you
will
join
us
we
start
in
half
an
hour
announced
the
curtly
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
the
rifle
lay
where
sheba
had
dropped
it
when
she
ran
to
gather
her
stricken
lover
into
her
arms
macdonald
picked
it
up
and
strode
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
without
a
backward
look
he
was
too
proud
to
stay
and
watch
them
it
was
impossible
to
escape
him
in
the
deep
snow
that
filled
the
hill
trails
and
he
was
convinced
they
would
attempt
nothing
of
the
kind
the
scotchman
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
old
and
spent
under
tremendous
difficulty
he
had
mushed
for
two
days
and
had
at
last
run
his
men
down
the
lust
of
vengeance
had
sat
on
his
shoulders
every
mile
of
the
way
and
had
driven
him
feverishly
forward
but
the
salt
that
had
lent
a
savor
to
his
passion
was
gone
even
though
he
won
he
lost
for
sheba
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
with
the
fierce
willfulness
of
his
temperament
he
tried
to
tread
under
foot
his
doubts
about
the
guilt
of
holt
and
elliot
success
had
made
him
arrogant
and
he
was
not
a
good
loser
he
hated
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
sheba
but
he
could
not
escape
respecting
him
elliot
had
fought
until
he
had
been
hammered
down
into
unconsciousness
and
he
had
crawled
to
his
feet
and
stood
erect
with
the
smile
of
the
unconquered
on
his
lips
was
this
the
sort
of
man
to
murder
in
cold
blood
a
kindly
old
gentleman
who
had
never
harmed
him
the
only
answer
macdonald
found
was
that
milton
had
taken
him
and
his
partners
by
surprise
they
had
been
driven
to
shoot
the
cashier
to
cover
up
their
crime
perhaps
holt
or
another
had
fired
the
actual
shots
but
elliot
was
none
the
less
guilty
the
heart
of
the
scotchman
was
bitter
within
him
he
intended
to
see
that
his
enemies
paid
to
the
last
ounce
he
would
harry
them
to
the
gallows
if
money
and
influence
could
do
it
none
the
less
his
doubts
persisted
if
they
had
planned
the
bank
robbery
why
did
they
wait
so
long
to
buy
supplies
for
their
escape
why
had
they
not
taken
the
river
instead
of
the
hill
trail
the
story
that
his
enemies
told
hung
together
it
had
the
ring
of
truth
the
facts
supported
it
one
piece
of
evidence
in
their
favor
macdonald
alone
knew
it
lay
buried
in
the
deep
snows
of
the
hills
he
shut
his
strong
teeth
in
the
firm
resolve
that
it
should
stay
there
chapter

digs
the
weather
had
moderated
a
good
deal
but
the
trail
was
a
protected
forest
one
the
two
teams
now
going
down
had
come
up
so
that
the
path
was
packed
fairly
hard
and
smooth
holt
lay
propped
on
his
own
sled
against
the
sheba
mushed
behind
gordon
she
chatted
with
them
both
but
ignored
entirely
the
existence
of
macdonald
who
followed
with
his
siberian
dogs
though
she
tried
not
to
let
her
lover
know
it
sheba
was
troubled
at
heart
gordon
was
practically
the
prisoner
of
a
man
who
hated
him
bitterly
who
believed
him
guilty
of
murder
and
who
would
go
through
fire
to
bring
punishment
home
to
him
she
knew
the
power
of
macdonald
with
the
money
back
of
him
he
had
for
two
years
fought
against
and
almost
prevailed
over
a
strong
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
he
was
as
masterful
in
his
hatred
as
in
his
love
the
dominant
fighting
figure
in
the
northwest
he
trod
his
sturdy
way
through
opposition
like
a
colossus
nor
did
she
any
longer
have
any
illusions
about
him
he
could
be
both
ruthless
and
unscrupulous
when
it
suited
his
purpose
as
the
day
wore
toward
noon
her
spirits
drooped
she
was
tired
physically
and
this
reacted
upon
her
courage
the
warmer
weather
was
spoiling
the
trail
it
became
so
soft
and
mushy
that
though
snowshoes
were
needed
they
could
not
be
worn
on
account
of
the
heavy
snow
which
clung
to
them
every
time
a
foot
was
lifted
they
wore
mukluks
but
sheba
was
wet
to
the
knees
the
spring
had
gone
from
her
step
her
shoulders
began
to
sag
for
some
time
gordon
eye
had
been
seeking
a
good
place
for
a
day
camp
he
found
it
in
a
bit
of
open
timber
above
the
trail
and
without
a
word
he
swung
his
team
from
the
path
where
are
you
going
demanded
macdonald
going
to
rest
for
an
hour
was
elliot
curt
answer
macdonald
jaw
clamped
he
strode
forward
through
the
snow
beside
the
trail
we
see
about
that
the
younger
man
faced
him
angrily
ca
you
see
she
is
done
man
there
is
not
another
mile
of
travel
in
her
until
she
has
rested
the
hard
gray
eyes
of
the
alaskan
took
in
the
slender
weary
figure
leaning
against
the
sled
on
a
soft
and
mushy
trail
like
this
where
every
footstep
punched
a
hole
in
the
loose
snow
the
dogs
could
not
travel
with
any
extra
weight
a
few
miles
farther
down
they
would
come
to
a
road
and
the
going
would
be
better
but
till
then
she
must
walk
macdonald
gave
way
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
and
turned
on
his
heel
at
the
sheba
dried
her
mukluks
stockings
caribou
mitts
and
short
skirts
too
tired
to
eat
she
forced
herself
to
swallow
a
few
bites
and
drank
eagerly
some
tea
gordon
had
brought
blankets
from
the
sled
and
he
persuaded
her
to
lie
down
for
a
few
minutes
you
call
me
soon
if
i
should
sleep
she
said
drowsily
and
her
eyes
were
closed
almost
before
the
words
were
off
her
lips
when
macdonald
came
to
order
the
start
half
an
hour
later
she
was
still
asleep
give
her
another
thirty
minutes
he
said
gruffly
youth
is
resilient
sheba
awoke
rested
and
ready
for
work
while
gordon
was
untangling
the
dogs
she
was
left
alone
for
a
minute
with
the
the
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
touched
her
impulsively
she
held
out
her
hand
you
going
to
be
fair
are
you
macdonald
because
you
like
him
you
wo
he
looked
straight
into
the
dark
appealing
eyes
i
going
to
be
fair
to
robert
milton
he
told
her
harshly
i
going
to
see
his
murderers
hanged
if
it
costs
me
every
dollar
i
have
in
the
world
none
of
us
object
to
justice
she
told
him
proudly
gordon
has
nothing
to
fear
if
only
the
truth
is
told
then
why
come
to
me
he
demanded
she
hesitated
then
with
a
wistful
little
smile
spoke
what
was
in
her
heart
i
afraid
you
wo
do
justice
to
yourself
you
good
and
brave
and
strong
but
you
very
willful
and
set
i
do
want
to
lose
my
friend
i
want
to
know
that
he
is
all
i
have
believed
him
a
great
man
who
stands
for
the
things
that
are
fine
and
clean
and
just
then
it
is
for
my
sake
and
not
for
his
that
you
want
me
to
drop
the
case
against
elliot
he
asked
ironically
for
yours
and
for
his
too
you
ca
hurt
him
nobody
can
really
be
hurt
from
outside
not
unless
he
is
a
traitor
to
himself
and
gordon
elliot
is
that
he
could
do
such
a
thing
as
this
with
which
you
charge
him
it
is
not
in
his
nature
he
can
explain
everything
i
do
doubt
that
he
and
his
friend
holt
are
great
little
explainers
in
spite
of
his
bitterness
sheba
felt
a
change
in
him
she
seemed
to
have
a
glimpse
of
his
turbid
soul
engaged
in
battle
he
turned
away
without
shaking
hands
but
it
struck
her
that
he
was
not
implacable
while
they
were
at
luncheon
half
a
dozen
laden
with
supplies
for
a
telephone
construction
line
outfit
had
passed
their
small
hoofs
had
punched
in
the
trail
at
every
step
instead
of
a
smooth
bottom
the
dogs
found
a
slushy
bog
cut
to
pieces
at
the
end
of
an
hour
of
wallowing
macdonald
called
a
halt
there
is
a
cutoff
just
below
here
it
will
save
us
nearly
two
miles
but
we
have
to
break
trail
swing
to
the
right
just
below
the
big
willow
he
told
elliot
i
join
you
presently
and
relieve
you
on
the
job
but
first
miss
and
i
are
going
for
a
little
side
trip
all
three
of
them
looked
at
him
in
sharp
surprise
gordon
opened
his
lips
to
answer
and
closed
them
again
without
speaking
sheba
had
flashed
a
warning
to
him
i
hope
this
trip
is
very
far
off
the
trail
she
said
quietly
just
a
wee
bit
tired
it
not
far
the
said
curtly
he
was
busy
unpacking
his
sled
presently
he
found
the
dog
moccasins
for
which
he
had
been
looking
repacked
his
sled
and
fitted
the
shoes
to
the
bleeding
feet
of
the
team
leader
elliot
suspicious
and
uncertain
what
to
do
watched
him
at
work
but
at
a
signal
from
sheba
turned
reluctantly
away
and
drove
down
to
the
cutoff
macdonald
turned
his
dogs
out
of
the
trail
and
followed
a
little
ridge
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
sheba
trudged
behind
him
she
was
full
of
wonder
at
what
he
meant
to
do
but
she
asked
no
questions
some
wise
instinct
was
telling
her
to
do
exactly
as
he
said
from
the
sled
he
took
a
shovel
and
gave
it
to
the
young
woman
dig
just
this
side
of
the
big
rock
close
to
the
root
of
the
tree
he
told
her
sheba
dug
and
at
the
second
stroke
of
the
spade
struck
something
hard
he
stooped
and
pulled
out
a
sack
open
it
he
said
rip
it
with
this
knife
she
ran
the
knife
along
the
coarse
weave
of
the
cloth
fifteen
or
twenty
smaller
sacks
lay
exposed
sheba
looked
up
at
macdonald
a
startled
question
in
her
eyes
he
nodded
you
guessed
it
this
is
part
of
the
gold
for
which
robert
milton
was
murdered
but
how
did
it
get
here
i
buried
it
there
yesterday
come
he
led
her
around
the
rock
back
of
it
lay
something
over
which
was
spread
a
long
bit
of
canvas
the
heart
of
sheba
was
beating
wildly
the
scotchman
looked
at
her
from
a
face
underneath
this
canvas
is
the
body
of
one
of
the
men
who
murdered
milton
he
died
more
miserably
than
the
man
he
shot
half
the
gold
stolen
from
the
bank
is
in
that
gunnysack
you
have
just
dug
up
if
you
tell
me
who
has
the
other
half
i
tell
you
who
helped
him
rob
the
bank
this
man
who
is
he
asked
sheba
almost
in
a
whisper
she
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
nervousness
macdonald
drew
back
the
cloth
and
showed
the
rough
hard
face
of
a
workingman
his
name
was
trelawney
i
kicked
him
out
of
our
camps
because
he
was
a
he
was
one
of
the
men
that
robbed
you
later
she
exclaimed
yes
and
now
he
has
tried
to
rob
me
again
and
has
paid
for
it
with
his
life
her
mind
flashed
back
over
the
past
then
his
partner
in
this
last
crime
must
have
been
the
same
man
what
his
name
that
was
with
him
last
time
northrup
he
nodded
slowly
i
hate
to
believe
it
but
it
is
probably
true
and
he
too
is
lying
somewhere
in
this
park
covered
with
snow
if
our
guess
is
right
and
gordon
you
admit
he
did
do
it
again
he
nodded
sulkily
no
he
did
do
it
joy
lilted
in
her
voice
so
you
brought
me
here
to
tell
me
oh
i
am
glad
my
friend
that
you
were
so
good
and
it
is
like
you
to
do
it
you
have
always
been
the
good
friend
to
me
the
scotchman
smiled
a
little
wistfully
you
take
a
mean
advantage
of
a
man
you
nurse
him
when
he
is
ill
and
are
kind
to
him
when
he
is
well
and
try
to
love
him
though
he
is
twice
your
age
and
more
then
when
his
enemy
is
in
his
power
he
finds
he
ca
strike
him
down
without
striking
you
too
take
your
young
man
sheba
and
marry
him
and
for
god
sake
get
him
out
of
alaska
before
i
come
to
grips
with
him
again
i
not
a
patient
man
and
he
tried
me
sair
they
say
i
a
good
hater
and
i
always
thought
it
true
but
what
the
use
of
hating
a
man
when
your
soft
arms
are
round
him
for
an
armor
the
fine
eyes
of
the
girl
were
wells
of
warm
light
her
gladness
was
not
for
herself
and
her
lover
only
but
for
the
friend
that
had
been
so
nearly
lost
and
was
now
found
he
believed
he
had
done
it
for
her
but
sheba
was
sure
his
reasons
lay
deeper
he
was
too
much
of
a
man
to
hide
evidence
and
let
his
rival
be
falsely
accused
of
murder
it
was
not
in
him
to
do
a
cheap
thing
like
that
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
he
was
too
decent
to
stab
in
the
back
but
she
was
willing
to
take
him
on
his
own
ground
i
always
be
thanking
you
for
your
goodness
to
me
she
told
him
simply
he
brushed
that
aside
at
once
there
one
thing
more
lass
likely
not
be
seeing
you
again
alone
so
i
say
it
now
do
waste
any
tears
on
colby
macdonald
do
fancy
any
foolishness
about
spoiling
his
life
that
may
be
true
of
halfling
boys
maybe
but
a
man
goes
his
ain
gait
even
when
he
gets
a
bit
facer
yes
she
agreed
and
in
a
flash
she
saw
what
would
happen
that
in
the
reaction
from
his
depression
he
would
turn
to
genevieve
mallory
and
marry
her
you
too
young
for
me
anyhow
too
soft
and
innocent
once
you
told
me
that
you
could
keep
step
with
me
it
true
you
ca
it
was
a
daft
dream
he
took
a
deep
breath
seemed
to
shake
himself
out
of
it
and
smiled
cheerfully
upon
her
we
put
our
on
the
sled
and
go
back
to
your
friends
he
continued
briskly
i
send
men
up
to
scour
the
hills
for
northrup
body
sheba
drew
the
canvas
back
over
the
face
of
the
dead
man
as
she
followed
macdonald
back
to
the
trail
tears
filled
her
eyes
she
was
remembering
that
the
white
stinging
death
that
had
crept
upon
these
men
so
swiftly
had
missed
her
by
a
hair
breadth
the
strong
lusty
life
had
been
stricken
out
of
the
big
cornishman
and
probably
of
his
partner
in
crime
perhaps
they
had
left
mothers
or
wives
or
sweethearts
to
mourn
them
macdonald
relieved
elliot
at
breaking
trail
and
the
young
man
went
back
to
the
they
had
discarded
mukluks
and
wore
moccasins
and
snowshoes
it
was
hard
slow
work
for
the
had
to
fight
his
way
through
snow
along
the
best
route
he
could
find
the
moon
was
high
when
at
last
they
reached
the
roadhouse
chapter
xxxii
diane
changes
her
mind
the
news
of
sheba
safety
had
been
telephoned
to
diane
from
the
roadhouse
so
that
all
the
family
from
peter
down
were
on
the
porch
to
welcome
her
with
mingled
tears
and
kisses
since
gordon
had
to
push
on
to
the
hospital
to
have
holt
taken
care
of
it
was
macdonald
who
brought
the
girl
home
the
declined
rather
brusquely
an
invitation
to
stay
to
dinner
on
the
plea
that
he
had
business
at
the
office
which
would
not
wait
impulsively
sheba
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
believe
me
i
am
thanking
you
with
the
whole
of
my
heart
my
friend
and
i
praying
for
you
the
old
irish
blessing
save
you
kindly
the
rapacious
eyes
of
the
scotchman
burned
into
hers
for
an
instant
without
a
word
he
released
her
hands
and
turned
away
her
eyes
followed
him
a
vital
dynamic
american
who
would
do
big
lawless
things
to
the
day
of
his
death
she
sighed
he
had
been
a
great
figure
in
her
life
and
now
he
had
passed
out
of
it
illustration
for
him
the
beauty
of
the
night
lay
largely
in
her
presence
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
with
diane
her
irish
cousin
dropped
the
little
bomb
she
had
up
her
sleeve
i
going
to
be
married
thursday
di
paget
embraced
her
for
the
tenth
time
within
the
hour
she
was
very
fond
of
sheba
and
she
had
been
on
a
great
strain
concerning
her
safety
that
out
of
her
danger
had
resulted
the
engagement
diane
had
hoped
for
was
surplusage
of
good
luck
you
lucky
sensible
girl
sheba
assented
demurely
i
do
think
i
sensible
as
well
as
lucky
it
is
every
girl
that
knows
the
right
man
for
her
even
when
he
wants
her
but
i
know
at
last
he
the
man
for
me
out
of
ten
million
i
sure
of
it
dear
oh
i
am
glad
diane
hugged
her
again
she
could
help
it
one
gets
to
know
a
man
pretty
well
on
a
trip
like
that
i
change
mine
for
any
one
that
was
ever
made
i
like
everything
about
him
di
i
am
the
happiest
girl
i
so
glad
you
see
it
that
way
at
last
diane
passed
to
the
practical
aspect
of
the
situation
but
thursday
will
that
give
us
time
my
dear
and
who
are
you
going
to
have
here
just
the
family
i
invited
two
guests
but
neither
of
them
can
come
one
has
a
broken
leg
and
the
other
says
he
does
want
to
see
me
married
to
another
man
sheba
explained
with
a
smile
so
gordon
wo
come
yes
he
have
to
be
here
we
ca
get
along
without
the
bridegroom
it
would
be
a
legal
marriage
would
it
diane
looked
at
her
for
the
moment
dumb
you
little
wretch
she
got
out
at
last
so
it
gordon
is
it
are
you
quite
sure
this
time
not
likely
to
change
your
mind
before
thursday
i
suppose
to
an
outsider
i
do
seem
fickle
miss
admitted
smilingly
but
gordon
and
i
both
understand
that
and
colby
macdonald
does
he
understand
it
too
oh
yes
her
smile
grew
broader
he
told
me
that
he
did
think
i
would
quite
suit
him
after
all
not
enough
experience
for
the
place
diane
flashed
a
suspicious
look
of
inquiry
of
course
that
nonsense
what
did
he
tell
you
something
like
that
he
will
marry
mallory
i
think
though
he
does
know
it
yet
you
mean
she
will
get
him
on
the
rebound
said
diane
bluntly
that
is
a
nice
way
to
put
it
he
has
always
liked
her
very
much
he
is
fond
of
her
for
what
she
is
what
attracted
him
in
me
were
the
things
his
imagination
gave
to
me
and
gordon
likes
you
i
suppose
for
what
you
are
sheba
did
not
resent
the
little
note
of
friendly
sarcasm
i
suppose
he
has
his
fancies
about
me
too
but
by
the
time
he
finds
out
what
i

diane

an
afterthought
she
added
macdonald

taking
massage

to
a
subject
of
more
immediate
interest

congratulations

she
kissed
him
too
for
old
sake
sake
i
do
believe

sheba
better

colby
macdonald
would
he
a
great
man
and
you

but
it
is
everybody
that

fit
to
be
the
wife
of
a
great
man

a
double
compliment
laughed
gordon
but
you
ca
say
anything
that
will
hurt
my
feelings
di
is
that
your
baby
i
heap
crying
what
a
heartless
mother

diane
gave
him
the
few
minutes
alone
with
sheba
that
his
gay
smile
had
asked
for
get
out
with
you
she
said
laughing
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
look
at
the
lovers
moon
i
ordered
there
expressly
for
you
and
while
you
are
there
forget
that
there
are
going
to
be
crying
babies
and
nursemaids
with
evenings
out
in
that
golden
future
of
yours
come
along
sheba
we
start
now
on
the
golden
trail
said
elliot
she
walked
as
if
she
loved
it
her
long
slender
legs
moved
rhythmically
and
her
arms
swung
true
as
pendulums
the
moon
was
all
that
diane
had
promised
sheba
drank
it
in
happily
i
believe
i
must
be
a
pagan
i
love
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
i
know
it
all
true
about
the
little
folk
and
the
pied
piper
and
if
it
paganism
to
be
in
love
with
the
world
you
are
a
degree
pagan
well
and
was
there
ever
a
more
beautiful
night
before
he
thought
not
but
he
had
not
the
words
to
tell
her
that
for
him
its
beauty
lay
largely
in
her
presence
her
passionate
love
of
things
fine
and
brave
transformed
the
universe
for
him
it
was
enough
for
him
to
be
near
her
to
hear
the
laughter
bubbling
in
her
throat
to
touch
her
crisp
hair
as
he
adjusted
the
scarf
about
her
head
god
made
the
night
he
replied
so
that
a
christian
thought
as
well
as
a
pagan
one
they
were
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
lovers
are
egoists
the
world
for
them
divided
itself
into
two
classes
one
included
sheba
and
gordon
elliot
the
other
took
in
the
uninteresting
remnant
of
humanity
no
matter
how
far
afield
their
talk
began
it
always
came
back
to
themselves
they
wanted
to
know
all
about
each
other
to
compare
experiences
and
points
of
view
but
time
fled
too
fast
for
words
they
talked
as
lovers
will
to
the
end
of
time
in
exclamations
and
the
meeting
of
eyes
and
little
endearments
when
diane
and
peter
found
them
on
the
hilltop
sheba
protested
with
her
smile
that
it
could
not
be
two
hours
since
she
and
gordon
had
left
the
peter
grinned
he
remembered
a
hilltop
consecrated
to
his
own
courtship
of
diane
the
only
wedding
present
that
macdonald
sent
sheba
was
a
long
envelope
with
two
documents
attached
by
a
clip
one
was
from
the
kusiak
sun
it
announced
that
the
search
party
had
found
the
body
of
northrup
with
the
rest
of
the
stolen
gold
beside
him
the
other
was
a
copy
of
a
legal
document
its
effect
was
that
the
district
attorney
had
dismissed
all
charges
pending
against
gordon
elliot
although
macdonald
lost
the
coal
claims
at
kamatlah
by
reason
of
the
report
of
elliot
all
alaska
still
believes
that
he
was
right
in
that
country
of
strong
men
he
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
his
fellows
he
has
the
fortunate
gift
of
commanding
the
admiration
of
friend
and
foe
alike
the
lady
who
is
his
wife
is
secretly
the
greatest
of
his
slaves
but
she
tries
not
to
let
him
know
how
much
he
has
captured
her
imagination
for
genevieve
macdonald
can
not
quite
understand
herself
how
so
elemental
an
emotion
as
love
can
have
pierced
the
armor
of
her
sophistication
