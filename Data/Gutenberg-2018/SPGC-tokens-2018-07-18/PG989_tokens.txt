preface
men
would
never
be
superstitious
if
they
could
govern
all
their
circumstances
by
set
rules
or
if
they
were
always
favoured
by
fortune
but
being
frequently
driven
into
straits
where
rules
are
useless
and
being
often
kept
fluctuating
pitiably
between
hope
and
fear
by
the
uncertainty
of
fortune
greedily
coveted
favours
they
are
consequently
for
the
most
part
very
prone
to
credulity
the
human
mind
is
readily
swayed
this
way
or
that
in
times
of
doubt
especially
when
hope
and
fear
are
struggling
for
the
mastery
though
usually
it
is
boastful
over
confident
and
vain
this
as
a
general
fact
i
suppose
everyone
knows
though
few
i
believe
know
their
own
nature
no
one
can
have
lived
in
the
world
without
observing
that
most
people
when
in
prosperity
are
so
with
wisdom
however
inexperienced
they
may
be
that
they
take
every
offer
of
advice
as
a
personal
insult
whereas
in
adversity
they
know
not
where
to
turn
but
beg
and
pray
for
counsel
from
every
no
plan
is
then
too
futile
too
absurd
or
too
fatuous
for
their
adoption
the
most
frivolous
causes
will
raise
them
to
hope
or
plunge
them
into
despair
if
anything
happens
during
their
fright
which
reminds
them
of
some
past
good
or
ill
they
think
it
portends
a
happy
or
unhappy
issue
and
therefore
though
it
may
have
proved
abortive
a
hundred
times
before
style
it
a
lucky
or
unlucky
omen
anything
which
excites
their
astonishment
they
believe
to
be
a
portent
signifying
the
anger
of
the
gods
or
of
the
supreme
being
and
mistaking
superstition
for
religion
account
it
impious
not
to
avert
the
evil
with
prayer
and
sacrifice
signs
and
wonders
of
this
sort
they
conjure
up
perpetually
till
one
might
think
nature
as
mad
as
themselves
they
interpret
her
so
fantastically
thus
it
is
brought
prominently
before
us
that
superstition
chief
victims
are
those
persons
who
greedily
covet
temporal
advantages
they
it
is
who
especially
when
they
are
in
danger
and
can
not
help
themselves
are
wont
with
prayers
and
womanish
tears
to
implore
help
from
god
upbraiding
reason
as
blind
because
she
can
not
show
a
sure
path
to
the
shadows
they
pursue
and
rejecting
human
wisdom
as
vain
but
believing
the
phantoms
of
imagination
dreams
and
other
childish
absurdities
to
be
the
very
oracles
of
heaven
as
though
god
had
turned
away
from
the
wise
and
written
his
decrees
not
in
the
mind
of
man
but
in
the
entrails
of
beasts
or
left
them
to
be
proclaimed
by
the
inspiration
and
instinct
of
fools
madmen
and
birds
such
is
the
unreason
to
which
terror
can
drive
mankind
superstition
then
is
engendered
preserved
and
fostered
by
fear
if
anyone
desire
an
example
let
him
take
alexander
who
only
began
superstitiously
to
seek
guidance
from
seers
when
he
first
learnt
to
fear
fortune
in
the
passes
of
sysis
curtius
whereas
after
he
had
conquered
darius
he
consulted
prophets
no
more
till
a
second
time
frightened
by
reverses
when
the
scythians
were
provoking
a
battle
the
bactrians
had
deserted
and
he
himself
was
lying
sick
of
his
wounds
he
once
more
turned
to
superstition
the
mockery
of
human
wisdom
and
bade
aristander
to
whom
he
confided
his
credulity
inquire
the
issue
of
affairs
with
sacrificed
victims
very
numerous
examples
of
a
like
nature
might
be
cited
clearly
showing
the
fact
that
only
while
under
the
dominion
of
fear
do
men
fall
a
prey
to
superstition
that
all
the
portents
ever
invested
with
the
reverence
of
misguided
religion
are
mere
phantoms
of
dejected
and
fearful
minds
and
lastly
that
prophets
have
most
power
among
the
people
and
are
most
formidable
to
rulers
precisely
at
those
times
when
the
state
is
in
most
peril
i
think
this
is
sufficiently
plain
to
all
and
will
therefore
say
no
more
on
the
subject
the
origin
of
superstition
above
given
affords
us
a
clear
reason
for
the
fact
that
it
comes
to
all
men
naturally
though
some
refer
its
rise
to
a
dim
notion
of
god
universal
to
mankind
and
also
tends
to
show
that
it
is
no
less
inconsistent
and
variable
than
other
mental
hallucinations
and
emotional
impulses
and
further
that
it
can
only
be
maintained
by
hope
hatred
anger
and
deceit
since
it
springs
not
from
reason
but
solely
from
the
more
powerful
phases
of
emotion
furthermore
we
may
readily
understand
how
difficult
it
is
to
maintain
in
the
same
course
men
prone
to
every
form
of
credulity
for
as
the
mass
of
mankind
remains
always
at
about
the
same
pitch
of
misery
it
never
assents
long
to
any
one
remedy
but
is
always
best
pleased
by
a
novelty
which
has
not
yet
proved
illusive
this
element
of
inconsistency
has
been
the
cause
of
many
terrible
wars
and
revolutions
for
as
curtius
well
says
lib
iv
chap
the
mob
has
no
ruler
more
potent
than
superstition
and
is
easily
led
on
the
plea
of
religion
at
one
moment
to
adore
its
kings
as
gods
and
anon
to
execrate
and
abjure
them
as
humanity
common
bane
immense
pains
have
therefore
been
taken
to
counteract
this
evil
by
investing
religion
whether
true
or
false
with
such
pomp
and
ceremony
that
it
may
rise
superior
to
every
shock
and
be
always
observed
with
studious
reverence
by
the
whole
people
a
system
which
has
been
brought
to
great
perfection
by
the
turks
for
they
consider
even
controversy
impious
and
so
clog
men
minds
with
dogmatic
formulas
that
they
leave
no
room
for
sound
reason
not
even
enough
to
doubt
with
but
if
in
despotic
statecraft
the
supreme
and
essential
mystery
be
to
hoodwink
the
subjects
and
to
mask
the
fear
which
keeps
them
clown
with
the
specious
garb
of
religion
so
that
men
may
fight
as
bravely
for
slavery
as
for
safety
and
count
it
not
shame
but
highest
honour
to
risk
their
blood
and
their
lives
for
the
vainglory
of
a
tyrant
yet
in
a
free
state
no
more
mischievous
expedient
could
be
planned
or
attempted
wholly
repugnant
to
the
general
freedom
are
such
devices
as
enthralling
men
minds
with
prejudices
forcing
their
judgment
or
employing
any
of
the
weapons
of
sedition
indeed
such
seditions
only
spring
up
when
law
enters
the
domain
of
speculative
thought
and
opinions
are
put
on
trial
and
condemned
on
the
same
footing
as
crimes
while
those
who
defend
and
follow
them
are
sacrificed
not
to
public
safety
but
to
their
hatred
and
cruelty
if
deeds
only
could
be
made
the
grounds
of
criminal
charges
and
words
were
always
allowed
to
pass
free
such
seditions
would
be
divested
of
every
semblance
of
justification
and
would
be
separated
from
mere
controversies
by
a
hard
and
fast
line
now
seeing
that
we
have
the
rare
happiness
of
living
in
a
republic
where
everyone
judgment
is
free
and
unshackled
where
each
may
worship
god
as
his
conscience
dictates
and
where
freedom
is
esteemed
before
all
things
dear
and
precious
i
have
believed
that
i
should
be
undertaking
no
ungrateful
or
unprofitable
task
in
demonstrating
that
not
only
can
such
freedom
be
granted
without
prejudice
to
the
public
peace
but
also
that
without
such
freedom
piety
can
not
flourish
nor
the
public
peace
be
secure
such
is
the
chief
conclusion
i
seek
to
establish
in
this
treatise
but
in
order
to
reach
it
i
must
first
point
out
the
misconceptions
which
like
scars
of
our
former
bondage
still
disfigure
our
notion
of
religion
and
must
expose
the
false
views
about
the
civil
authority
which
many
have
most
impudently
advocated
endeavouring
to
turn
the
mind
of
the
people
still
prone
to
heathen
superstition
away
from
its
legitimate
rulers
and
so
bring
us
again
into
slavery
as
to
the
order
of
my
treatise
i
will
speak
presently
but
first
i
will
recount
the
causes
which
led
me
to
write
i
have
often
wondered
that
persons
who
make
a
boast
of
professing
the
christian
religion
namely
love
joy
peace
temperance
and
charity
to
all
men
should
quarrel
with
such
rancorous
animosity
and
display
daily
towards
one
another
such
bitter
hatred
that
this
rather
than
the
virtues
they
claim
is
the
readiest
criterion
of
their
faith
matters
have
long
since
come
to
such
a
pass
that
one
can
only
pronounce
a
man
christian
turk
jew
or
heathen
by
his
general
appearance
and
attire
by
his
frequenting
this
or
that
place
of
worship
or
employing
the
phraseology
of
a
particular
sect
as
for
manner
of
life
it
is
in
all
cases
the
same
inquiry
into
the
cause
of
this
anomaly
leads
me
unhesitatingly
to
ascribe
it
to
the
fact
that
the
ministries
of
the
church
are
regarded
by
the
masses
merely
as
dignities
her
offices
as
posts
of
emolument
in
short
popular
religion
may
be
summed
up
as
respect
for
ecclesiastics
the
spread
of
this
misconception
inflamed
every
worthless
fellow
with
an
intense
desire
to
enter
holy
orders
and
thus
the
love
of
diffusing
god
religion
degenerated
into
sordid
avarice
and
ambition
every
church
became
a
theatre
where
orators
instead
of
church
teachers
harangued
caring
not
to
instruct
the
people
but
striving
to
attract
admiration
to
bring
opponents
to
public
scorn
and
to
preach
only
novelties
and
paradoxes
such
as
would
tickle
the
ears
of
their
congregation
this
state
of
things
necessarily
stirred
up
an
amount
of
controversy
envy
and
hatred
which
no
lapse
of
time
could
appease
so
that
we
can
scarcely
wonder
that
of
the
old
religion
nothing
survives
but
its
outward
forms
even
these
in
the
mouth
of
the
multitude
seem
rather
adulation
than
adoration
of
the
deity
and
that
faith
has
become
a
mere
compound
of
credulity
and
prejudices
aye
prejudices
too
which
degrade
man
from
rational
being
to
beast
which
completely
stifle
the
power
of
judgment
between
true
and
false
which
seem
in
fact
carefully
fostered
for
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
the
last
spark
of
reason
piety
great
god
and
religion
are
become
a
tissue
of
ridiculous
mysteries
men
who
flatly
despise
reason
who
reject
and
turn
away
from
understanding
as
naturally
corrupt
these
i
say
these
of
all
men
are
thought
lie
most
horrible
to
possess
light
from
on
high
verily
if
they
had
but
one
spark
of
light
from
on
high
they
would
not
insolently
rave
but
would
learn
to
worship
god
more
wisely
and
would
be
as
marked
among
their
fellows
for
mercy
as
they
now
are
for
malice
if
they
were
concerned
for
their
opponents
souls
instead
of
for
their
own
reputations
they
would
no
longer
fiercely
persecute
but
rather
be
filled
with
pity
and
compassion
furthermore
if
any
divine
light
were
in
them
it
would
appear
from
their
doctrine
i
grant
that
they
are
never
tired
of
professing
their
wonder
at
the
profound
mysteries
of
holy
writ
still
i
can
not
discover
that
they
teach
anything
but
speculations
of
platonists
and
aristotelians
to
which
in
order
to
save
their
credit
for
christianity
they
have
made
holy
writ
conform
not
content
to
rave
with
the
greeks
themselves
they
want
to
make
the
prophets
rave
also
showing
conclusively
that
never
even
in
sleep
have
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
scripture
divine
nature
the
very
vehemence
of
their
admiration
for
the
mysteries
plainly
attests
that
their
belief
in
the
bible
is
a
formal
assent
rather
than
a
living
faith
and
the
fact
is
made
still
more
apparent
by
their
laying
down
beforehand
as
a
foundation
for
the
study
and
true
interpretation
of
scripture
the
principle
that
it
is
in
every
passage
true
and
divine
such
a
doctrine
should
be
reached
only
after
strict
scrutiny
and
thorough
comprehension
of
the
sacred
books
which
would
teach
it
much
better
for
they
stand
in
need
no
human
factions
and
not
be
set
up
on
the
threshold
as
it
were
of
inquiry
as
i
pondered
over
the
facts
that
the
light
of
reason
is
not
only
despised
but
by
many
even
execrated
as
a
source
of
impiety
that
human
commentaries
are
accepted
as
divine
records
and
that
credulity
is
extolled
as
faith
as
i
marked
the
fierce
controversies
of
philosophers
raging
in
church
and
state
the
source
of
bitter
hatred
and
dissension
the
ready
instruments
of
sedition
and
other
ills
innumerable
i
determined
to
examine
the
bible
afresh
in
a
careful
impartial
and
unfettered
spirit
making
no
assumptions
concerning
it
and
attributing
to
it
no
doctrines
which
i
do
not
find
clearly
therein
set
down
with
these
precautions
i
constructed
a
method
of
scriptural
interpretation
and
thus
equipped
proceeded
to
inquire
what
is
prophecy
in
what
sense
did
god
reveal
himself
to
the
prophets
and
why
were
these
particular
men
chosen
by
him
was
it
on
account
of
the
sublimity
of
their
thoughts
about
the
deity
and
nature
or
was
it
solely
on
account
of
their
piety
these
questions
being
answered
i
was
easily
able
to
conclude
that
the
authority
of
the
prophets
has
weight
only
in
matters
of
morality
and
that
their
speculative
doctrines
affect
us
little
next
i
inquired
why
the
hebrews
were
called
god
chosen
people
and
discovering
that
it
was
only
because
god
had
chosen
for
them
a
certain
strip
of
territory
where
they
might
live
peaceably
and
at
ease
i
learnt
that
the
law
revealed
by
god
to
moses
was
merely
the
law
of
the
individual
hebrew
state
therefore
that
it
was
binding
on
none
but
hebrews
and
not
even
on
hebrews
after
the
downfall
of
their
nation
further
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
it
could
be
concluded
from
scripture
that
the
human
understanding
standing
is
naturally
corrupt
i
inquired
whether
the
universal
religion
the
divine
law
revealed
through
the
prophets
and
apostles
to
the
whole
human
race
differs
from
that
which
is
taught
by
the
light
of
natural
reason
whether
miracles
can
take
place
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
if
so
whether
they
imply
the
existence
of
god
more
surely
and
clearly
than
events
which
we
understand
plainly
and
distinctly
through
their
immediate
natural
causes
now
as
in
the
whole
course
of
my
investigation
i
found
nothing
taught
expressly
by
scripture
which
does
not
agree
with
our
understanding
or
which
is
repugnant
thereto
and
as
i
saw
that
the
prophets
taught
nothing
which
is
not
very
simple
and
easily
to
be
grasped
by
all
and
further
that
they
clothed
their
leaching
in
the
style
and
confirmed
it
with
the
reasons
which
would
most
deeply
move
the
mind
of
the
masses
to
devotion
towards
god
i
became
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
bible
leaves
reason
absolutely
free
that
it
has
nothing
in
common
with
philosophy
in
fact
that
revelation
and
philosophy
stand
on
different
footings
in
order
to
set
this
forth
categorically
and
exhaust
the
whole
question
i
point
out
the
way
in
which
the
bible
should
be
interpreted
and
show
that
all
of
spiritual
questions
should
be
sought
from
it
alone
and
not
from
the
objects
of
ordinary
knowledge
thence
i
pass
on
to
indicate
the
false
notions
which
have
from
the
fact
that
the
multitude
ever
prone
to
superstition
and
caring
more
for
the
shreds
of
antiquity
for
eternal
truths
pays
homage
to
the
books
of
the
bible
rather
than
to
the
word
of
god
i
show
that
the
word
of
god
has
not
been
revealed
as
a
certain
number
of
books
was
displayed
to
the
prophets
as
a
simple
idea
of
the
mind
namely
obedience
to
god
in
singleness
of
heart
and
in
the
practice
of
justice
and
charity
and
i
further
point
out
that
this
doctrine
is
set
forth
in
scripture
in
accordance
with
the
opinions
and
understandings
of
those
among
whom
the
apostles
and
prophets
preached
to
the
end
that
men
might
receive
it
willingly
and
with
their
whole
heart
having
thus
laid
bare
the
bases
of
belief
i
draw
the
conclusion
that
revelation
has
obedience
for
its
sole
object
therefore
in
purpose
no
less
than
in
foundation
and
method
stands
entirely
aloof
from
ordinary
knowledge
each
has
its
separate
province
neither
can
be
called
the
handmaid
of
the
other
furthermore
as
men
habits
of
mind
differ
so
that
some
more
readily
embrace
one
form
of
faith
some
another
for
what
moves
one
to
pray
may
move
another
only
to
scoff
i
conclude
in
accordance
with
what
has
gone
before
that
everyone
should
be
free
to
choose
for
himself
the
foundations
of
his
creed
and
that
faith
should
be
judged
only
by
its
fruits
each
would
then
obey
god
freely
with
his
whole
heart
while
nothing
would
be
publicly
honoured
save
justice
and
charity
having
thus
drawn
attention
to
the
liberty
conceded
to
everyone
by
the
revealed
law
of
god
i
pass
on
to
another
part
of
my
subject
and
prove
that
this
same
liberty
can
and
should
be
accorded
with
safety
to
the
state
and
the
magisterial
authority
in
fact
that
it
can
not
be
withheld
without
great
danger
to
peace
and
detriment
to
the
community
in
order
to
establish
my
point
i
start
from
the
natural
rights
of
the
individual
which
are
with
his
desires
and
power
and
from
the
fact
that
no
one
is
bound
to
live
as
another
pleases
but
is
the
guardian
of
his
own
liberty
i
show
that
these
rights
can
only
be
transferred
to
those
whom
we
depute
to
defend
us
who
acquire
with
the
duties
of
defence
the
power
of
ordering
our
lives
and
i
thence
infer
that
rulers
possess
rights
only
limited
by
their
power
that
they
are
the
sole
guardians
of
justice
and
liberty
and
that
their
subjects
should
act
in
all
things
as
they
dictate
nevertheless
since
no
one
can
so
utterly
abdicate
his
own
power
of
as
to
cease
to
be
a
man
i
conclude
that
no
one
can
be
deprived
of
his
natural
rights
absolutely
but
that
subjects
either
by
tacit
agreement
or
by
social
contract
retain
a
certain
number
which
can
not
be
taken
from
them
without
great
danger
to
the
state
from
these
considerations
i
pass
on
to
the
hebrew
state
which
i
describe
at
some
length
in
order
to
trace
the
manner
in
which
religion
acquired
the
force
of
law
and
to
touch
on
other
noteworthy
points
i
then
prove
that
the
holders
of
sovereign
power
are
the
depositories
and
interpreters
of
religious
no
less
than
of
civil
ordinances
and
that
they
alone
have
the
right
to
decide
what
is
just
or
unjust
pious
or
impious
lastly
i
conclude
by
showing
that
they
best
retain
this
right
and
secure
safety
to
their
state
by
allowing
every
man
to
think
what
he
likes
and
say
what
he
thinks
such
philosophical
reader
are
the
questions
i
submit
to
your
notice
counting
on
your
approval
for
the
subject
matter
of
the
whole
book
and
of
the
several
chapters
is
important
and
profitable
i
would
say
more
but
i
do
not
want
my
preface
to
extend
to
a
volume
especially
as
i
know
that
its
leading
propositions
are
to
philosophers
but
common
places
to
the
rest
of
mankind
i
care
not
to
commend
my
treatise
for
i
can
not
expect
that
it
contains
anything
to
please
them
i
know
how
deeply
rooted
are
the
prejudices
embraced
under
the
name
of
religion
i
am
aware
that
in
the
mind
of
the
masses
superstition
is
no
less
deeply
rooted
than
fear
i
recognize
that
their
constancy
is
mere
obstinacy
and
that
they
are
led
to
praise
or
blame
by
impulse
rather
than
reason
therefore
the
multitude
and
those
of
like
passions
with
the
multitude
i
ask
not
to
read
my
book
nay
i
would
rather
that
they
should
utterly
neglect
it
than
that
they
should
misinterpret
it
after
their
wont
they
would
gain
no
good
themselves
and
might
prove
a
to
others
whose
philosophy
is
hampered
by
the
belief
that
reason
is
a
mere
handmaid
to
theology
and
whom
i
seek
in
this
work
especially
to
benefit
but
as
there
will
be
many
who
have
neither
the
leisure
nor
perhaps
the
inclination
to
read
through
all
i
have
written
i
feel
bound
here
as
at
the
end
of
my
treatise
to
declare
that
i
have
written
nothing
which
i
do
not
most
willingly
submit
to
the
examination
and
judgment
of
my
country
rulers
and
that
i
am
ready
to
retract
anything
which
they
shall
decide
to
be
repugnant
to
the
laws
or
prejudicial
to
the
public
good
i
know
that
i
am
a
man
and
as
a
man
liable
to
error
but
against
error
i
have
taken
scrupulous
care
and
striven
to
keep
in
entire
accordance
with
the
laws
of
my
country
with
loyalty
and
with
morality
chapter
i
of
prophecy
prophecy
or
revelation
is
sure
knowledge
revealed
by
god
to
man
a
prophet
is
one
who
interprets
the
revelations
of
god
insights
to
those
who
are
unable
to
attain
to
sure
knowledge
of
the
matters
revealed
and
therefore
can
only
apprehend
them
by
simple
faith
the
hebrew
word
for
prophet
is
endnote
speaker
or
interpreter
but
in
scripture
its
meaning
is
restricted
to
interpreter
of
god
as
we
may
learn
from
exodus
where
god
says
to
moses
see
i
have
made
thee
a
god
to
pharaoh
and
aaron
thy
brother
shall
be
thy
prophet
implying
that
since
in
interpreting
moses
words
to
pharaoh
aaron
acted
the
part
of
a
prophet
moses
would
be
to
pharaoh
as
a
god
or
in
the
attitude
of
a
god
prophets
i
will
treat
of
in
the
next
chapter
and
at
present
consider
prophecy
now
it
is
evident
from
the
definition
above
given
that
prophecy
really
includes
ordinary
knowledge
for
the
knowledge
which
we
acquire
by
our
natural
faculties
depends
on
knowledge
of
god
and
his
eternal
laws
but
ordinary
knowledge
is
common
to
all
men
as
men
and
rests
on
foundations
which
all
share
whereas
the
multitude
always
strains
after
rarities
and
exceptions
and
thinks
little
of
the
gifts
of
nature
so
that
when
prophecy
is
talked
of
ordinary
knowledge
is
not
supposed
to
be
included
nevertheless
it
has
as
much
right
as
any
other
to
be
called
divine
for
god
nature
in
so
far
as
we
share
therein
and
god
laws
dictate
it
to
us
nor
does
it
suffer
from
that
to
which
we
give
the
preeminence
except
in
so
far
as
the
latter
transcends
its
limits
and
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
natural
laws
taken
in
themselves
in
respect
to
the
certainty
it
involves
and
the
source
from
which
it
is
derived
god
ordinary
knowledge
is
no
whit
inferior
to
prophetic
unless
indeed
we
believe
or
rather
dream
that
the
prophets
had
human
bodies
but
superhuman
minds
and
therefore
that
their
sensations
and
consciousness
were
entirely
different
from
our
own
but
although
ordinary
knowledge
is
divine
its
professors
can
not
be
called
prophets
endnote
for
they
teach
what
the
rest
of
mankind
could
perceive
and
apprehend
not
merely
by
simple
faith
but
as
surely
and
honourably
as
themselves
seeing
then
that
our
mind
subjectively
contains
in
itself
and
partakes
of
the
nature
of
god
and
solely
from
this
cause
is
enabled
to
form
notions
explaining
natural
phenomena
and
inculcating
morality
it
follows
that
we
may
rightly
assert
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
in
so
far
as
it
is
thus
conceived
to
be
a
primary
cause
of
divine
revelation
all
that
we
clearly
and
distinctly
understand
is
dictated
to
us
as
i
have
just
pointed
out
by
the
idea
and
nature
of
god
not
indeed
through
words
but
in
a
way
far
more
excellent
and
agreeing
perfectly
with
the
nature
of
the
mind
as
all
who
have
enjoyed
intellectual
certainty
will
doubtless
attest
here
however
my
chief
purpose
is
to
speak
of
matters
having
reference
to
scripture
so
these
few
words
on
the
light
of
reason
will
suffice
i
will
now
pass
on
to
and
treat
more
fully
the
other
ways
and
means
by
which
god
makes
revelations
to
mankind
both
of
that
which
transcends
ordinary
knowledge
and
of
that
within
its
scope
for
there
is
no
reason
why
god
should
not
employ
other
means
to
communicate
what
we
know
already
by
the
power
of
reason
our
conclusions
on
the
subject
must
be
drawn
solely
from
scripture
for
what
can
we
affirm
about
matters
transcending
our
knowledge
except
what
is
told
us
by
the
words
or
writings
of
prophets
and
since
there
are
so
far
as
i
know
no
prophets
now
alive
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
read
the
books
of
prophets
departed
taking
care
the
while
not
to
reason
from
metaphor
or
to
ascribe
anything
to
our
authors
which
they
do
not
themselves
distinctly
state
i
must
further
premise
that
the
jews
never
make
any
mention
or
account
of
secondary
or
particular
causes
but
in
a
spirit
of
religion
piety
and
what
is
commonly
called
godliness
refer
all
things
directly
to
the
deity
for
instance
if
they
make
money
by
a
transaction
they
say
god
gave
it
to
them
if
they
desire
anything
they
say
god
has
disposed
their
hearts
towards
it
if
they
think
anything
they
say
god
told
them
hence
we
must
not
suppose
that
everything
is
prophecy
or
revelation
which
is
described
in
scripture
as
told
by
god
to
anyone
but
only
such
things
as
are
expressly
announced
as
prophecy
or
revelation
or
are
plainly
pointed
to
as
such
by
the
context
a
perusal
of
the
sacred
books
will
show
us
that
all
god
revelations
to
the
prophets
were
made
through
words
or
appearances
or
a
combination
of
the
two
these
words
and
appearances
were
of
two
kinds
real
when
external
to
the
mind
of
the
prophet
who
heard
or
saw
them
imaginary
when
the
imagination
of
the
prophet
was
in
a
state
which
led
him
distinctly
to
suppose
that
he
heard
or
saw
them
with
a
real
voice
god
revealed
to
moses
the
laws
which
he
wished
to
be
transmitted
to
the
hebrews
as
we
may
see
from
exodus
where
god
says
and
there
i
will
meet
with
thee
and
i
will
commune
with
thee
from
the
mercy
seat
which
is
between
the
cherubim
some
sort
of
real
voice
must
necessarily
have
been
employed
for
moses
found
god
ready
to
commune
with
him
at
any
time
this
as
i
shall
shortly
show
is
the
only
instance
of
a
real
voice
we
might
perhaps
suppose
that
the
voice
with
which
god
called
samuel
was
real
for
in
sam
we
read
and
the
lord
appeared
again
in
shiloh
for
the
lord
revealed
himself
to
samuel
in
shiloh
by
the
word
of
the
lord
implying
that
the
appearance
of
the
lord
consisted
in
his
making
himself
known
to
samuel
through
a
voice
in
other
words
that
samuel
heard
the
lord
speaking
but
we
are
compelled
to
distinguish
between
the
prophecies
of
moses
and
those
of
other
prophets
and
therefore
must
decide
that
this
voice
was
imaginary
a
conclusion
further
supported
by
the
resemblance
to
the
voice
of
eli
which
samuel
was
in
the
habit
of
hearing
and
therefore
might
easily
imagine
when
thrice
called
by
the
lord
samuel
supposed
it
to
have
been
eli
the
voice
which
abimelech
heard
was
imaginary
for
it
is
written
and
god
said
unto
him
in
a
dream
so
that
the
will
of
god
was
manifest
to
him
not
in
waking
but
only
in
sleep
that
is
when
the
imagination
is
most
active
and
uncontrolled
some
of
the
jews
believe
that
the
actual
words
of
the
decalogue
were
not
spoken
by
god
but
that
the
israelites
heard
a
noise
only
without
any
distinct
words
and
during
its
continuance
apprehended
the
ten
commandments
by
pure
intuition
to
this
opinion
i
myself
once
inclined
seeing
that
the
words
of
the
decalogue
in
exodus
are
different
from
the
words
of
the
decalogue
in
deuteronomy
for
the
discrepancy
seemed
to
imply
since
god
only
spoke
once
that
the
ten
commandments
were
not
intended
to
convey
the
actual
words
of
the
lord
but
only
his
meaning
however
unless
we
would
do
violence
to
scripture
we
must
certainly
admit
that
the
israelites
heard
a
real
voice
for
scripture
expressly
says
deut
god
spake
with
you
face
to
face
as
two
men
ordinarily
interchange
ideas
through
the
instrumentality
of
their
two
bodies
and
therefore
it
seems
more
consonant
with
holy
writ
to
suppose
that
god
really
did
create
a
voice
of
some
kind
with
which
the
decalogue
was
revealed
the
discrepancy
of
the
two
versions
is
treated
of
in
chap
viii
yet
not
even
thus
is
all
difficulty
removed
for
it
seems
scarcely
reasonable
to
affirm
that
a
created
thing
depending
on
god
in
the
same
manner
as
other
created
things
would
be
able
to
express
or
explain
the
nature
of
god
either
verbally
or
really
by
means
of
its
individual
organism
for
instance
by
declaring
in
the
first
person
i
am
the
lord
your
god
certainly
when
anyone
says
with
his
mouth
i
understand
we
do
not
attribute
the
understanding
to
the
mouth
but
to
the
mind
of
the
speaker
yet
this
is
because
the
mouth
is
the
natural
organ
of
a
man
speaking
and
the
hearer
knowing
what
understanding
is
easily
comprehends
by
a
comparison
with
himself
that
the
speaker
mind
is
meant
but
if
we
knew
nothing
of
god
beyond
the
mere
name
and
wished
to
commune
with
him
and
be
assured
of
his
existence
i
fail
to
see
how
our
wish
would
be
satisfied
by
the
declaration
of
a
created
thing
depending
on
god
neither
more
nor
less
than
ourselves
i
am
the
lord
if
god
contorted
the
lips
of
moses
or
i
will
not
say
moses
but
some
beast
till
they
pronounced
the
words
i
am
the
lord
should
we
apprehend
the
lord
existence
therefrom
scripture
seems
clearly
to
point
to
the
belief
that
god
spoke
himself
having
descended
from
heaven
to
mount
sinai
for
the
purpose
and
not
only
that
the
israelites
heard
him
speaking
but
that
their
chief
men
beheld
him
ex
xxiv
further
the
law
of
moses
which
might
neither
be
added
to
nor
curtailed
and
which
was
set
up
as
a
national
standard
of
right
nowhere
prescribed
the
belief
that
god
is
without
body
or
even
without
form
or
figure
but
only
ordained
that
the
jews
should
believe
in
his
existence
and
worship
him
alone
it
forbade
them
to
invent
or
fashion
any
likeness
of
the
deity
but
this
was
to
insure
purity
of
service
because
never
having
seen
god
they
could
not
by
means
of
images
recall
the
likeness
of
god
but
only
the
likeness
of
some
created
thing
which
might
thus
gradually
take
the
place
of
god
as
the
object
of
their
adoration
nevertheless
the
bible
clearly
implies
that
god
has
a
form
and
that
moses
when
he
heard
god
speaking
was
permitted
to
behold
it
or
at
least
its
hinder
parts
doubtless
some
mystery
lurks
in
this
question
which
we
will
discuss
more
fully
below
for
the
present
i
will
call
attention
to
the
passages
in
scripture
indicating
the
means
by
which
god
has
revealed
his
laws
to
man
revelation
may
be
through
figures
only
as
in
i
chron
where
god
displays
his
anger
to
david
by
means
of
an
angel
bearing
a
sword
and
also
in
the
story
of
balaam
maimonides
and
others
do
indeed
maintain
that
these
and
every
other
instance
of
angelic
apparitions
to
manoah
and
to
abraham
offering
up
isaac
occurred
during
sleep
for
that
no
one
with
his
eyes
open
ever
could
see
an
angel
but
this
is
mere
nonsense
the
sole
object
of
such
commentators
seems
to
be
to
extort
from
scripture
confirmations
of
aristotelian
quibbles
and
their
own
inventions
a
proceeding
which
i
regard
as
the
acme
of
absurdity
in
figures
not
real
but
existing
only
in
the
prophet
imagination
god
revealed
to
joseph
his
future
lordship
and
in
words
and
figures
he
revealed
to
joshua
that
he
would
fight
for
the
hebrews
causing
to
appear
an
angel
as
it
were
the
captain
of
the
lord
host
bearing
a
sword
and
by
this
means
communicating
verbally
the
forsaking
of
israel
by
providence
was
portrayed
to
isaiah
by
a
vision
of
the
lord
the
thrice
holy
sitting
on
a
very
lofty
throne
and
the
hebrews
stained
with
the
mire
of
their
sins
sunk
as
it
were
in
uncleanness
and
thus
as
far
as
possible
distant
from
god
the
wretchedness
of
the
people
at
the
time
was
thus
revealed
while
future
calamities
were
foretold
in
words
i
could
cite
from
holy
writ
many
similar
examples
but
i
think
they
are
sufficiently
well
known
already
however
we
get
a
still
more
clear
confirmation
of
our
position
in
num
as
follows
if
there
be
any
prophet
among
you
i
the
lord
will
make
myself
known
unto
him
in
a
vision
by
appearances
and
signs
for
god
says
of
the
prophecy
of
moses
that
it
was
a
vision
without
signs
and
will
speak
unto
him
in
a
dream
not
with
actual
words
and
an
actual
voice
my
servant
moses
is
not
so
with
him
will
i
speak
mouth
to
mouth
even
apparently
and
not
in
dark
speeches
and
the
similitude
of
the
lord
he
shall
behold
looking
on
me
as
a
friend
and
not
afraid
he
speaks
with
me
cf
ex
this
makes
it
indisputable
that
the
other
prophets
did
not
hear
a
real
voice
and
we
gather
as
much
from
deut
and
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
israel
like
unto
moses
whom
the
lord
knew
face
to
face
which
must
mean
that
the
lord
spoke
with
none
other
for
not
even
moses
saw
the
lord
face
these
are
the
only
media
of
communication
between
god
and
man
which
i
find
mentioned
in
scripture
and
therefore
the
only
ones
which
may
be
supposed
or
invented
we
may
be
able
quite
to
comprehend
that
god
can
communicate
immediately
with
man
for
without
the
intervention
of
bodily
means
he
communicates
to
our
minds
his
essence
still
a
man
who
can
by
pure
intuition
comprehend
ideas
which
are
neither
contained
in
nor
deducible
from
the
foundations
of
our
natural
knowledge
must
necessarily
possess
a
mind
far
superior
to
those
of
his
fellow
men
nor
do
i
believe
that
any
have
been
so
endowed
save
christ
to
him
the
ordinances
of
god
leading
men
to
salvation
were
revealed
directly
without
words
or
visions
so
that
god
manifested
himself
to
the
apostles
through
the
mind
of
christ
as
he
formerly
did
to
moses
through
the
supernatural
voice
in
this
sense
the
voice
of
christ
like
the
voice
which
moses
heard
may
be
called
the
voice
of
god
and
it
may
be
said
that
the
wisdom
of
god
wisdom
more
than
human
took
upon
itself
in
christ
human
nature
and
that
christ
was
the
way
of
salvation
i
must
at
this
juncture
declare
that
those
doctrines
which
certain
churches
put
forward
concerning
christ
i
neither
affirm
nor
deny
for
i
freely
confess
that
i
do
not
understand
them
what
i
have
just
stated
i
gather
from
scripture
where
i
never
read
that
god
appeared
to
christ
or
spoke
to
christ
but
that
god
was
revealed
to
the
apostles
through
christ
that
christ
was
the
way
of
life
and
that
the
old
law
was
given
through
an
angel
and
not
immediately
by
god
whence
it
follows
that
if
moses
spoke
with
god
face
to
face
as
a
man
speaks
with
his
friend
by
means
of
their
two
bodies
christ
communed
with
god
mind
to
mind
thus
we
may
conclude
that
no
one
except
christ
received
the
revelations
of
god
without
the
aid
of
imagination
whether
in
words
or
vision
therefore
the
power
of
prophecy
implies
not
a
peculiarly
perfect
mind
but
a
peculiarly
vivid
imagination
as
i
will
show
more
clearly
in
the
next
chapter
we
will
now
inquire
what
is
meant
in
the
bible
by
the
spirit
of
god
breathed
into
the
prophets
or
by
the
prophets
speaking
with
the
spirit
of
god
to
that
end
we
must
determine
the
exact
signification
of
the
hebrew
word
commonly
translated
spirit
the
word
literally
means
a
wind
the
south
wind
but
it
is
frequently
employed
in
other
derivative
significations
it
is
used
as
equivalent
to
breath
neither
is
there
any
spirit
in
his
mouth
ps
life
or
breathing
and
his
spirit
returned
to
him
sam
he
breathed
again
courage
and
strength
neither
did
there
remain
any
more
spirit
in
any
man
josh
and
the
spirit
entered
into
me
and
made
me
stand
on
my
feet
ezek
virtue
and
fitness
days
should
speak
and
multitudes
of
years
should
teach
wisdom
but
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
job
wisdom
is
not
always
found
among
old
men
for
i
now
discover
that
it
depends
on
individual
virtue
and
capacity
so
a
man
in
whom
is
the
spirit
numbers
habit
of
mind
because
he
had
another
spirit
with
him
numbers
another
habit
of
mind
behold
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
unto
you
prov
will
purpose
desire
impulse
whither
the
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
ezek
that
cover
with
a
covering
but
not
of
my
spirit
is
for
the
lord
hath
poured
out
on
you
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep
is
then
was
their
spirit
softened
judges
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
is
better
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
prov
he
that
hath
no
ru
over
his
own
spirit
prov
your
spirit
as
fire
shall
devour
you
isaiah
from
the
meaning
of
disposition
we
get
passions
and
faculties
a
lofty
spirit
means
pride
a
lowly
spirit
humility
an
evil
spirit
hatred
and
melancholy
so
too
the
expressions
spirits
of
jealousy
fornication
wisdom
counsel
bravery
stand
for
a
jealous
lascivious
wise
prudent
or
brave
mind
for
we
hebrews
use
substantives
in
preference
to
adjectives
or
these
various
qualities
the
mind
itself
or
the
life
yea
they
have
all
one
spirit
eccles
the
spirit
shall
return
to
god
who
gave
it
the
quarters
of
the
world
from
the
winds
which
blow
thence
or
even
the
side
of
anything
turned
towards
a
particular
quarter
ezek
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
way
in
which
things
are
referred
to
god
and
said
to
be
of
god
as
belonging
to
his
nature
and
being
as
it
were
part
of
him
the
power
of
god
the
eyes
of
god
as
under
his
dominion
and
depending
on
his
pleasure
thus
the
heavens
are
called
the
heavens
of
the
lord
as
being
his
chariot
and
habitation
so
nebuchadnezzar
is
called
the
servant
of
god
assyria
the
scourge
of
god
as
dedicated
to
him
the
temple
of
god
a
nazarene
of
god
the
bread
of
god
as
revealed
through
the
prophets
and
not
through
our
natural
faculties
in
this
sense
the
mosaic
law
is
called
the
law
of
god
as
being
in
the
superlative
degree
very
high
mountains
are
styled
the
mountains
of
god
a
very
deep
sleep
the
sleep
of
god
in
this
sense
we
must
explain
amos
i
have
overthrown
you
as
the
overthrow
of
the
lord
came
upon
sodom
and
gomorrah
that
memorable
overthrow
for
since
god
himself
is
the
speaker
the
passage
can
not
well
be
taken
otherwise
the
wisdom
of
solomon
is
called
the
wisdom
of
god
or
extraordinary
the
size
of
the
cedars
of
lebanon
is
alluded
to
in
the
psalmist
expression
the
cedars
of
the
lord
similarly
if
the
jews
were
at
a
loss
to
understand
any
phenomenon
or
were
ignorant
of
its
cause
they
referred
it
to
god
thus
a
storm
was
termed
the
chiding
of
god
thunder
and
lightning
the
arrows
of
god
for
it
was
thought
that
god
kept
the
winds
confined
in
caves
his
treasuries
thus
differing
merely
in
name
from
the
greek
eolus
in
like
manner
miracles
were
called
works
of
god
as
being
especially
marvellous
though
in
reality
of
course
all
natural
events
are
the
works
of
god
and
take
place
solely
by
his
power
the
psalmist
calls
the
miracles
in
egypt
the
works
of
god
because
the
hebrews
found
in
them
a
way
of
safety
which
they
had
not
looked
for
and
therefore
especially
marvelled
at
as
then
unusual
natural
phenomena
are
called
works
of
god
and
trees
of
unusual
size
are
called
trees
of
god
we
can
not
wonder
that
very
strong
and
tall
men
though
impious
robbers
and
whoremongers
are
in
genesis
called
sons
of
god
this
reference
of
things
wonderful
to
god
was
not
peculiar
to
the
jews
pharaoh
on
hearing
the
interpretation
of
his
dream
exclaimed
that
the
mind
of
the
gods
was
in
joseph
nebuchadnezzar
told
daniel
that
he
possessed
the
mind
of
the
holy
gods
so
also
in
latin
anything
well
made
is
often
said
to
be
wrought
with
divine
hands
which
is
equivalent
to
the
hebrew
phrase
wrought
with
the
hand
of
god
we
can
now
very
easily
understand
and
explain
those
passages
of
scripture
which
speak
of
the
spirit
of
god
in
some
places
the
expression
merely
means
a
very
strong
dry
and
deadly
wind
as
in
isaiah
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
because
the
spirit
of
the
lord
bloweth
upon
it
similarly
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
moved
over
the
face
of
the
waters
at
other
times
it
is
used
as
equivalent
to
a
high
courage
thus
the
spirit
of
gideon
and
of
samson
is
called
the
spirit
of
the
lord
as
being
very
bold
and
prepared
for
any
emergency
any
unusual
virtue
or
power
is
called
the
spirit
or
virtue
of
the
lord
ex
i
will
fill
him
bezaleel
with
the
spirit
of
the
lord
as
the
bible
itself
explains
with
talent
above
man
usual
endowment
so
isa
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
him
is
explained
afterwards
in
the
text
to
mean
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
of
counsel
and
might
the
melancholy
of
saul
is
called
the
melancholy
of
the
lord
or
a
very
deep
melancholy
the
persons
who
applied
the
term
showing
that
they
understood
by
it
nothing
supernatural
in
that
they
sent
for
a
musician
to
assuage
it
by
again
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
used
as
equivalent
to
the
mind
of
man
for
instance
job
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
in
my
nostrils
the
allusion
being
to
and
god
breathed
into
man
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
ezekiel
also
prophesying
to
the
dead
says
and
i
will
give
to
you
my
spirit
and
ye
shall
live
i
will
restore
you
to
life
in
job
we
read
if
he
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
breath
in
my
spirit
shall
not
always
strive
with
man
for
that
he
also
is
flesh
since
man
acts
on
the
dictates
of
his
body
and
not
the
spirit
which
i
gave
him
to
discern
the
good
i
will
let
him
alone
so
too
ps
create
in
me
a
clean
heart
god
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me
cast
me
not
away
from
thy
presence
and
take
not
thy
holy
spirit
from
me
it
was
supposed
that
sin
originated
only
from
the
body
and
that
good
impulses
come
from
the
mind
therefore
the
psalmist
invokes
the
aid
of
god
against
the
bodily
appetites
but
prays
that
the
spirit
which
the
lord
the
holy
one
had
given
him
might
be
renewed
again
inasmuch
as
the
bible
in
concession
to
popular
ignorance
describes
god
as
having
a
mind
a
heart
emotions
nay
even
a
body
and
breath
the
expression
spirit
of
the
lord
is
used
for
god
mind
disposition
emotion
strength
or
breath
thus
isa
who
hath
disposed
the
spirit
of
the
lord
who
save
himself
hath
caused
the
mind
of
the
lord
to
will
anything
and
isa
but
they
rebelled
and
vexed
the
holy
spirit
the
phrase
comes
to
be
used
of
the
law
of
moses
which
in
a
sense
expounds
god
will
is
lxiii
where
is
he
that
put
his
holy
spirit
within
him
meaning
as
we
clearly
gather
from
the
context
the
law
of
moses
nehemiah
speaking
of
the
giving
of
the
law
says
thou
gavest
also
thy
good
spirit
to
instruct
them
this
is
referred
to
in
deut
this
is
your
wisdom
and
understanding
and
in
ps
thy
good
spirit
will
lead
me
into
the
land
of
uprightness
the
spirit
of
the
lord
may
mean
the
breath
of
the
lord
for
breath
no
less
than
a
mind
a
heart
and
a
body
are
attributed
to
god
in
scripture
as
in
ps
hence
it
gets
to
mean
the
power
strength
or
faculty
of
god
as
in
job
the
spirit
of
the
lord
made
me
the
power
or
if
you
prefer
the
decree
of
the
lord
so
the
psalmist
in
poetic
language
declares
by
the
word
of
the
lord
were
the
heavens
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
by
a
mandate
issued
as
it
were
in
one
breath
also
ps
wither
shall
i
go
from
thy
spirit
or
whither
shall
i
flee
from
thy
presence
whither
shall
i
go
so
as
to
be
beyond
thy
power
and
thy
presence
lastly
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
used
in
scripture
to
express
the
emotions
of
god
his
kindness
and
mercy
micah
is
the
spirit
the
mercy
of
the
lord
straitened
are
these
cruelties
his
doings
zech
not
by
might
or
by
power
but
my
spirit
mercy
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
twelfth
verse
of
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
same
prophet
must
i
think
be
interpreted
in
like
manner
yea
they
made
their
hearts
as
an
adamant
stone
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
words
which
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
in
his
spirit
in
his
mercy
by
the
former
prophets
so
also
haggai
so
my
spirit
remaineth
among
you
fear
not
the
passage
in
isaiah
and
now
the
lord
and
his
spirit
hath
sent
me
may
be
taken
to
refer
to
god
mercy
or
his
revealed
law
for
the
prophet
says
from
the
beginning
from
the
time
when
i
first
came
to
you
to
preach
god
anger
and
his
sentence
forth
against
you
i
spoke
not
in
secret
from
the
time
that
it
was
there
am
i
and
now
i
am
sent
by
the
mercy
of
god
as
a
joyful
messenger
to
preach
your
restoration
or
we
may
understand
him
to
mean
by
the
revealed
law
that
he
had
before
come
to
warn
them
by
the
command
of
the
law
levit
in
the
same
manner
under
the
same
conditions
as
moses
had
warned
them
that
now
like
moses
he
ends
by
preaching
their
restoration
but
the
first
explanation
seems
to
me
the
best
returning
then
to
the
main
object
of
our
discussion
we
find
that
the
scriptural
phrases
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
upon
a
prophet
the
lord
breathed
his
spirit
into
men
men
were
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
with
the
holy
spirit
are
quite
clear
to
us
and
mean
that
prophets
were
endowed
with
a
peculiar
and
extraordinary
power
and
devoted
themselves
to
piety
with
especial
constancy
that
thus
they
perceived
the
mind
or
the
thought
of
god
for
we
have
shown
that
god
spirit
signifies
in
hebrew
god
mind
or
thought
and
that
the
law
which
shows
his
mind
and
thought
is
called
his
spirit
hence
that
the
imagination
of
the
prophets
inasmuch
as
through
it
were
revealed
the
decrees
of
god
may
equally
be
called
the
mind
of
god
and
the
prophets
be
said
to
have
possessed
the
mind
of
god
on
our
minds
also
the
mind
of
god
and
his
eternal
thoughts
are
impressed
but
this
being
the
same
for
all
men
is
less
taken
into
account
especially
by
the
hebrews
who
claimed
a
and
despised
other
men
and
other
men
knowledge
lastly
the
prophets
were
said
to
possess
the
spirit
of
god
because
men
knew
not
the
cause
of
prophetic
knowledge
and
in
their
wonder
referred
it
with
other
marvels
directly
to
the
deity
styling
it
divine
knowledge
we
need
no
longer
scruple
to
affirm
that
the
prophets
only
perceived
god
revelation
by
the
aid
of
imagination
that
is
by
words
and
figures
either
real
or
imaginary
we
find
no
other
means
mentioned
in
scripture
and
therefore
must
not
invent
any
as
to
the
particular
law
of
nature
by
which
the
communications
took
place
i
confess
my
ignorance
i
might
indeed
say
as
others
do
that
they
took
place
by
the
power
of
god
but
this
would
be
mere
trifling
and
no
better
than
explaining
some
unique
specimen
by
a
transcendental
term
everything
takes
place
by
the
power
of
god
nature
herself
is
the
power
of
god
under
another
name
and
our
ignorance
of
the
power
of
god
is
with
our
ignorance
of
nature
it
is
absolute
folly
therefore
to
ascribe
an
event
to
the
power
of
god
when
we
know
not
its
natural
cause
which
is
the
power
of
god
however
we
are
not
now
inquiring
into
the
causes
of
prophetic
knowledge
we
are
only
attempting
as
i
have
said
to
examine
the
scriptural
documents
and
to
draw
our
conclusions
from
them
as
from
ultimate
natural
facts
the
causes
of
the
documents
do
not
concern
us
as
the
prophets
perceived
the
revelations
of
god
by
the
aid
of
imagination
they
could
indisputably
perceive
much
that
is
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
intellect
for
many
more
ideas
can
be
constructed
from
words
and
figures
than
from
the
principles
and
notions
on
which
the
whole
fabric
of
reasoned
knowledge
is
reared
thus
we
have
a
clue
to
the
fact
that
the
prophets
perceived
nearly
everything
in
parables
and
allegories
and
clothed
spiritual
truths
in
bodily
forms
for
such
is
the
usual
method
of
imagination
we
need
no
longer
wonder
that
scripture
and
the
prophets
speak
so
strangely
and
obscurely
of
god
spirit
or
mind
cf
numbers
kings
that
the
lord
was
seen
by
micah
as
sitting
by
daniel
as
an
old
man
clothed
in
white
by
ezekiel
as
a
fire
that
the
holy
spirit
appeared
to
those
with
christ
as
a
descending
dove
to
the
apostles
as
fiery
tongues
to
paul
on
his
conversion
as
a
great
light
all
these
expressions
are
plainly
in
harmony
with
the
current
ideas
of
god
and
spirits
inasmuch
as
imagination
is
fleeting
and
inconstant
we
find
that
the
power
of
prophecy
did
not
remain
with
a
prophet
for
long
nor
manifest
itself
frequently
but
was
very
rare
manifesting
itself
only
in
a
few
men
and
in
them
not
often
we
must
necessarily
inquire
how
the
prophets
became
assured
of
the
truth
of
what
they
perceived
by
imagination
and
not
by
sure
mental
laws
but
our
investigation
must
be
confined
to
scripture
for
the
subject
is
one
on
which
we
can
not
acquire
certain
knowledge
and
which
we
can
not
explain
by
the
immediate
causes
scripture
teaching
about
the
assurance
of
prophets
i
will
treat
of
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
ii
of
prophets
it
follows
from
the
last
chapter
that
as
i
have
said
the
prophets
were
endowed
with
unusually
vivid
imaginations
and
not
with
unusually
perfect
minds
this
conclusion
is
amply
sustained
by
scripture
for
we
are
told
that
solomon
was
the
wisest
of
men
but
had
no
special
faculty
of
prophecy
heman
calcol
and
dara
though
men
of
great
talent
were
not
prophets
whereas
uneducated
countrymen
nay
even
women
such
as
hagar
handmaid
were
thus
gifted
nor
is
this
contrary
to
ordinary
experience
and
reason
men
of
great
imaginative
power
are
less
fitted
for
abstract
reasoning
whereas
those
who
excel
in
intellect
and
its
use
keep
their
imagination
more
restrained
and
controlled
holding
it
in
subjection
so
to
speak
lest
it
should
usurp
the
place
of
reason
thus
to
suppose
that
knowledge
of
natural
and
spiritual
phenomena
can
be
gained
from
the
prophetic
books
is
an
utter
mistake
which
i
shall
endeavour
to
expose
as
i
think
philosophy
the
age
and
the
question
itself
demand
i
care
not
for
the
girdings
of
superstition
for
superstition
is
the
bitter
enemy
of
all
true
knowledge
and
true
morality
yes
it
has
come
to
this
men
who
openly
confess
that
they
can
form
no
idea
of
god
and
only
know
him
through
created
things
of
which
they
know
not
the
causes
can
unblushingly
accuse
philosophers
of
atheism
treating
the
question
methodically
i
will
show
that
prophecies
varied
not
only
according
to
the
imagination
and
physical
temperament
of
the
prophet
but
also
according
to
his
particular
opinions
and
further
that
prophecy
never
rendered
the
prophet
wiser
than
he
was
before
but
i
will
first
discuss
the
assurance
of
truth
which
the
prophets
received
for
this
is
akin
to
the
of
the
chapter
and
will
serve
to
elucidate
somewhat
our
present
point
imagination
does
not
in
its
own
nature
involve
any
certainty
of
truth
such
as
is
implied
in
every
clear
and
distinct
idea
but
requires
some
extrinsic
reason
to
assure
us
of
its
objective
reality
hence
prophecy
can
not
afford
certainty
and
the
prophets
were
assured
of
god
revelation
by
some
sign
and
not
by
the
fact
of
revelation
as
we
may
see
from
abraham
who
when
he
had
heard
the
promise
of
god
demanded
a
sign
not
because
he
did
not
believe
in
god
but
because
he
wished
to
be
sure
that
it
was
god
who
made
the
promise
the
fact
is
still
more
evident
in
the
case
of
gideon
show
me
he
says
to
god
show
me
a
sign
that
i
may
know
that
it
is
thou
that
talkest
with
me
god
also
says
to
moses
and
let
this
be
a
sign
that
i
have
sent
thee
hezekiah
though
he
had
long
known
isaiah
to
be
a
prophet
none
the
less
demanded
a
sign
of
the
cure
which
he
predicted
it
is
thus
quite
evident
that
the
prophets
always
received
some
sign
to
certify
them
of
their
prophetic
imaginings
and
for
this
reason
moses
bids
the
jews
deut
xviii
ask
of
the
prophets
a
sign
namely
the
prediction
of
some
coming
event
in
this
respect
prophetic
knowledge
is
inferior
to
natural
knowledge
which
needs
no
sign
and
in
itself
implies
certitude
moreover
scripture
warrants
the
statement
that
the
certitude
of
the
prophets
was
not
mathematical
but
moral
moses
lays
down
the
punishment
of
death
for
the
prophet
who
preaches
new
gods
even
though
he
confirm
his
doctrine
by
signs
and
wonders
deut
xiii
for
he
says
the
lord
also
worketh
signs
and
wonders
to
try
his
people
and
jesus
christ
warns
his
disciples
of
the
same
thing
matt
furthermore
ezekiel
plainly
states
that
god
sometimes
deceives
men
with
false
revelations
and
micaiah
bears
like
witness
in
the
case
of
the
prophets
of
ahab
although
these
instances
go
to
prove
that
revelation
is
open
to
doubt
it
nevertheless
contains
as
we
have
said
a
considerable
element
of
certainty
for
god
never
deceives
the
good
nor
his
chosen
but
according
to
the
ancient
proverb
and
as
appears
in
the
history
of
abigail
and
her
speech
god
uses
the
good
as
instruments
of
goodness
and
the
wicked
as
means
to
execute
his
wrath
this
may
be
seen
from
the
case
of
micaiah
above
quoted
for
although
god
had
determined
to
deceive
ahab
through
prophets
he
made
use
of
lying
prophets
to
the
good
prophet
he
revealed
the
truth
and
did
not
forbid
his
proclaiming
it
still
the
certitude
of
prophecy
remains
as
i
have
said
merely
moral
for
no
one
can
justify
himself
before
god
nor
boast
that
he
is
an
instrument
for
god
goodness
scripture
itself
teaches
and
shows
that
god
led
away
david
to
number
the
people
though
it
bears
ample
witness
to
david
piety
the
whole
question
of
the
certitude
of
prophecy
was
based
on
these
three
considerations
that
the
things
revealed
were
imagined
very
vividly
affecting
the
prophets
in
the
same
way
as
things
seen
when
awake
the
presence
of
a
sign
lastly
and
chiefly
that
the
mind
of
the
prophet
was
given
wholly
to
what
was
right
and
good
although
scripture
does
not
always
make
mention
of
a
sign
we
must
nevertheless
suppose
that
a
sign
was
always
vouchsafed
for
scripture
does
not
always
relate
every
condition
and
circumstance
as
many
have
remarked
but
rather
takes
them
for
granted
we
may
however
admit
that
no
sign
was
needed
when
the
prophecy
declared
nothing
that
was
not
already
contained
in
the
law
of
moses
because
it
was
confirmed
by
that
law
for
instance
jeremiah
prophecy
of
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
was
confirmed
by
the
prophecies
of
other
prophets
and
by
the
threats
in
the
law
and
therefore
it
needed
no
sign
whereas
hananiah
who
contrary
to
all
the
prophets
foretold
the
speedy
restoration
of
the
state
stood
in
need
of
a
sign
or
he
would
have
been
in
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
his
prophecy
until
it
was
confirmed
by
facts
the
prophet
which
prophesieth
of
peace
when
the
word
of
the
prophet
shall
come
to
pass
then
shall
the
prophet
be
known
that
the
lord
hath
truly
sent
him
as
then
the
certitude
afforded
to
the
prophet
by
signs
was
not
mathematical
did
not
necessarily
follow
from
the
perception
of
the
thing
perceived
or
seen
but
only
moral
and
as
the
signs
were
only
given
to
convince
the
prophet
it
follows
that
such
signs
were
given
according
to
the
opinions
and
capacity
of
each
prophet
so
that
a
sign
which
convince
one
prophet
would
fall
far
short
of
convincing
another
who
was
imbued
with
different
opinions
therefore
the
signs
varied
according
to
the
individual
prophet
so
also
did
the
revelation
vary
as
we
have
stated
according
to
individual
disposition
and
temperament
and
according
to
the
opinions
previously
held
it
varied
according
to
disposition
in
this
way
if
a
prophet
was
cheerful
victories
peace
and
events
which
make
men
glad
were
revealed
to
him
in
that
he
was
naturally
more
likely
to
imagine
such
things
if
on
the
contrary
he
was
melancholy
wars
massacres
and
calamities
were
revealed
and
so
according
as
a
prophet
was
merciful
gentle
quick
to
anger
or
severe
he
was
more
fitted
for
one
kind
of
revelation
than
another
it
varied
according
to
the
temper
of
imagination
in
this
way
if
a
prophet
was
cultivated
he
perceived
the
mind
of
god
in
a
cultivated
way
if
he
was
confused
he
perceived
it
confusedly
and
so
with
revelations
perceived
through
visions
if
a
prophet
was
a
countryman
he
saw
visions
of
oxen
cows
and
the
like
if
he
was
a
soldier
he
saw
generals
and
armies
if
a
courtier
a
royal
throne
and
so
on
lastly
prophecy
varied
according
to
the
opinions
held
by
the
prophets
for
instance
to
the
magi
who
believed
in
the
follies
of
astrology
the
birth
of
christ
was
revealed
through
the
vision
of
a
star
in
the
east
to
the
augurs
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
was
revealed
through
entrails
whereas
the
king
himself
inferred
it
from
oracles
and
the
direction
of
arrows
which
he
shot
into
the
air
to
prophets
who
believed
that
man
acts
from
free
choice
and
by
his
own
power
god
was
revealed
as
standing
apart
from
and
ignorant
of
future
human
actions
all
of
which
we
will
illustrate
from
scripture
the
first
point
is
proved
from
the
case
of
elisha
who
in
order
to
prophecy
to
jehoram
asked
for
a
harp
and
was
unable
to
perceive
the
divine
purpose
till
he
had
been
recreated
by
its
music
then
indeed
he
prophesied
to
jehoram
and
to
his
allies
glad
tidings
which
previously
he
had
been
unable
to
attain
to
because
he
was
angry
with
the
king
and
these
who
are
angry
with
anyone
can
imagine
evil
of
him
but
not
good
the
theory
that
god
does
not
reveal
himself
to
the
angry
or
the
sad
is
a
mere
dream
for
god
revealed
to
moses
while
angry
the
terrible
slaughter
of
the
firstborn
and
did
so
without
the
intervention
of
a
harp
to
cain
in
his
rage
god
was
revealed
and
to
ezekiel
impatient
with
anger
was
revealed
the
contumacy
and
wretchedness
of
the
jews
jeremiah
miserable
and
weary
of
life
prophesied
the
disasters
of
the
hebrews
so
that
josiah
would
not
consult
him
but
inquired
of
a
woman
inasmuch
as
it
was
more
in
accordance
with
womanly
nature
that
god
should
reveal
his
mercy
thereto
so
micaiah
never
prophesied
good
to
ahab
though
other
true
prophets
had
done
so
but
invariably
evil
thus
we
see
that
individual
prophets
were
by
temperament
more
fitted
for
one
sort
of
revelation
than
another
the
style
of
the
prophecy
also
varied
according
to
the
eloquence
of
the
individual
prophet
the
prophecies
of
ezekiel
and
amos
are
not
written
in
a
cultivated
style
like
those
of
isaiah
and
nahum
but
more
rudely
any
hebrew
scholar
who
wishes
to
inquire
into
this
point
more
closely
and
compares
chapters
of
the
different
prophets
treating
of
the
same
subject
will
find
great
dissimilarity
of
style
compare
for
instance
chap
of
the
courtly
isaiah
verse
to
verse
with
chap
of
the
countryman
amos
verses
compare
also
the
order
and
reasoning
of
the
prophecies
of
jeremiah
written
in
idumaea
chap
xlix
with
the
order
and
reasoning
of
obadiah
compare
lastly
isa
and
with
hosea
and
and
so
on
a
due
consideration
of
these
passage
will
clearly
show
us
that
god
has
no
particular
style
in
speaking
but
according
to
the
learning
and
capacity
of
the
prophet
is
cultivated
compressed
severe
untutored
prolix
or
obscure
there
was
moreover
a
certain
variation
in
the
visions
vouchsafed
to
the
prophets
and
in
the
symbols
by
which
they
expressed
them
for
isaiah
saw
the
glory
of
the
lord
departing
from
the
temple
in
a
different
form
from
that
presented
to
ezekiel
the
rabbis
indeed
maintain
that
both
visions
were
really
the
same
but
that
ezekiel
being
a
countryman
was
above
measure
impressed
by
it
and
therefore
set
it
forth
in
full
detail
but
unless
there
is
a
trustworthy
tradition
on
the
subject
which
i
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
this
theory
is
plainly
an
invention
isaiah
saw
seraphim
with
six
wings
ezekiel
beasts
with
four
wings
isaiah
saw
god
clothed
and
sitting
on
a
royal
throne
ezekiel
saw
him
in
the
likeness
of
a
fire
each
doubtless
saw
god
under
the
form
in
which
he
usually
imagined
him
further
the
visions
varied
in
clearness
as
well
as
in
details
for
the
revelations
of
zechariah
were
too
obscure
to
be
understood
by
the
prophet
without
explanation
as
appears
from
his
narration
of
them
the
visions
of
daniel
could
not
be
understood
by
him
even
after
they
had
been
explained
and
this
obscurity
did
not
arise
from
the
difficulty
of
the
matter
revealed
for
being
merely
human
affairs
these
only
transcended
human
capacity
in
being
future
but
solely
in
the
fact
that
daniel
imagination
was
not
so
capable
for
prophecy
while
he
was
awake
as
while
he
was
asleep
and
this
is
further
evident
from
the
fact
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
vision
he
was
so
terrified
that
he
almost
despaired
of
his
strength
thus
on
account
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
imagination
and
his
strength
the
things
revealed
were
so
obscure
to
him
that
he
could
not
understand
them
even
after
they
had
been
explained
here
we
may
note
that
the
words
heard
by
daniel
were
as
we
have
shown
above
simply
imaginary
so
that
it
is
hardly
wonderful
that
in
his
frightened
state
he
imagined
them
so
confusedly
and
obscurely
that
afterwards
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
those
who
say
that
god
did
not
wish
to
make
a
clear
revelation
do
not
seem
to
have
read
the
words
of
the
angel
who
expressly
says
that
he
came
to
make
the
prophet
understand
what
should
befall
his
people
in
the
latter
days
dan
the
revelation
remained
obscure
because
no
one
was
found
at
that
time
with
imagination
sufficiently
strong
to
conceive
it
more
clearly
lastly
the
prophets
to
whom
it
was
revealed
that
god
would
take
away
elijah
wished
to
persuade
elisha
that
he
had
been
taken
somewhere
where
they
would
find
him
showing
sufficiently
clearly
that
they
had
not
understood
god
revelation
aright
there
is
no
need
to
set
this
out
more
amply
for
nothing
is
more
plain
in
the
bible
than
that
god
endowed
some
prophets
with
far
greater
gifts
of
prophecy
than
others
but
i
will
show
in
greater
detail
and
length
for
i
consider
the
point
more
important
that
the
prophecies
varied
according
to
the
opinions
previously
embraced
by
the
prophets
and
that
the
prophets
held
diverse
and
even
contrary
opinions
and
prejudices
i
speak
be
it
understood
solely
of
matters
speculative
for
in
regard
to
uprightness
and
morality
the
case
is
widely
different
from
thence
i
shall
conclude
that
prophecy
never
rendered
the
prophets
more
learned
but
left
them
with
their
former
opinions
and
that
we
are
therefore
not
at
all
bound
to
trust
them
in
matters
of
intellect
everyone
has
been
strangely
hasty
in
affirming
that
the
prophets
knew
everything
within
the
scope
of
human
intellect
and
although
certain
passages
of
scripture
plainly
affirm
that
the
prophets
were
in
certain
respects
ignorant
such
persons
would
rather
say
that
they
do
not
understand
the
passages
than
admit
that
there
was
anything
which
the
prophets
did
not
know
or
else
they
try
to
wrest
the
scriptural
words
away
from
their
evident
meaning
if
either
of
these
proceedings
is
allowable
we
may
as
well
shut
our
bibles
for
vainly
shall
we
attempt
to
prove
anything
from
them
if
their
plainest
passages
may
be
classed
among
obscure
and
impenetrable
mysteries
or
if
we
may
put
any
interpretation
on
them
which
we
fancy
for
instance
nothing
is
more
clear
in
the
bible
than
that
joshua
and
perhaps
also
the
author
who
wrote
his
history
thought
that
the
sun
revolves
round
the
earth
and
that
the
earth
is
fixed
and
further
that
the
sun
for
a
certain
period
remained
still
many
who
will
not
admit
any
movement
in
the
heavenly
bodies
explain
away
the
passage
till
it
seems
to
mean
something
quite
different
others
who
have
learned
to
philosophize
more
correctly
and
understand
that
the
earth
moves
while
the
sun
is
still
or
at
any
rate
does
not
revolve
round
the
earth
try
with
all
their
might
to
wrest
this
meaning
from
scripture
though
plainly
nothing
of
the
sort
is
intended
such
quibblers
excite
my
wonder
are
we
forsooth
bound
to
believe
that
joshua
the
soldier
was
a
learned
astronomer
or
that
a
miracle
could
not
be
revealed
to
him
or
that
the
light
of
the
sun
could
not
remain
longer
than
usual
above
the
horizon
without
his
knowing
the
cause
to
me
both
alternatives
appear
ridiculous
and
therefore
i
would
rather
say
that
joshua
was
ignorant
of
the
true
cause
of
the
lengthened
day
and
that
he
and
the
whole
host
with
him
thought
that
the
sun
moved
round
the
earth
every
day
and
that
on
that
particular
occasion
it
stood
still
for
a
time
thus
causing
the
light
to
remain
longer
and
i
would
say
that
they
did
not
conjecture
that
from
the
amount
of
snow
in
the
air
see
josh
the
refraction
may
have
been
greater
than
usual
or
that
there
may
have
been
some
other
cause
which
we
will
not
now
inquire
into
so
also
the
sign
of
the
shadow
going
back
was
revealed
to
isaiah
according
to
his
understanding
that
is
as
proceeding
from
a
going
backwards
of
the
sun
for
he
too
thought
that
the
sun
moves
and
that
the
earth
is
still
of
parhelia
he
perhaps
never
even
dreamed
we
may
arrive
at
this
conclusion
without
any
scruple
for
the
sign
could
really
have
come
to
pass
and
have
been
predicted
by
isaiah
to
the
king
without
the
prophet
being
aware
of
the
real
cause
with
regard
to
the
building
of
the
temple
by
solomon
if
it
was
really
dictate
by
god
we
must
maintain
the
same
doctrine
namely
that
all
the
measurements
were
revealed
according
to
the
opinions
and
understanding
of
the
king
for
as
we
are
not
bound
to
believe
that
solomon
was
a
mathematician
we
may
affirm
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
true
ratio
between
the
circumference
and
the
diameter
of
a
circle
and
that
like
the
generality
of
workmen
he
thought
that
it
was
as
three
to
one
but
if
it
is
allowable
to
declare
that
we
do
not
understand
the
passage
in
good
sooth
i
know
nothing
in
the
bible
that
we
can
understand
for
the
process
of
building
is
there
narrated
simply
and
as
a
mere
matter
of
history
if
again
it
is
permitted
to
pretend
that
the
passage
has
another
meaning
and
was
written
as
it
is
from
some
reason
unknown
to
us
this
is
no
less
than
a
complete
subversal
of
the
bible
for
every
absurd
and
evil
invention
of
human
perversity
could
thus
without
detriment
to
scriptural
authority
be
defended
and
fostered
our
conclusion
is
in
no
wise
impious
for
though
solomon
isaiah
joshua
were
prophets
they
were
none
the
less
men
and
as
such
not
exempt
from
human
shortcomings
according
to
the
understanding
of
noah
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
god
as
about
to
destroy
the
whole
human
race
for
noah
thought
that
beyond
the
limits
of
palestine
the
world
was
not
inhabited
not
only
in
matters
of
this
kind
but
in
others
more
important
the
about
the
divine
attributes
but
held
quite
ordinary
notions
about
god
and
to
these
notions
their
revelations
were
adapted
as
i
will
demonstrate
by
ample
scriptural
testimony
from
all
which
one
may
easily
see
that
they
were
praised
and
commended
not
so
much
for
the
sublimity
and
eminence
of
their
intellect
as
for
their
piety
and
faithfulness
adam
the
first
man
to
whom
god
was
revealed
did
not
know
that
he
is
omnipotent
and
omniscient
for
he
hid
himself
from
him
and
attempted
to
make
excuses
for
his
fault
before
god
as
though
he
had
had
to
do
with
a
man
therefore
to
him
also
was
god
revealed
according
to
his
understanding
that
is
as
being
unaware
of
his
situation
or
his
sin
for
adam
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
the
lord
walling
in
the
garden
calling
him
and
asking
him
where
he
was
and
then
on
seeing
his
shamefacedness
asking
him
whether
he
had
eaten
of
the
forbidden
fruit
adam
evidently
only
knew
the
deity
as
the
creator
of
all
things
to
cain
also
god
was
revealed
according
to
his
understanding
as
ignorant
of
human
affairs
nor
was
a
higher
conception
of
the
deity
required
for
repentance
of
his
sin
to
laban
the
lord
revealed
himself
as
the
god
of
abraham
because
laban
believed
that
each
nation
had
its
own
special
divinity
see
abraham
also
knew
not
that
god
is
omnipresent
and
has
foreknowledge
of
all
things
for
when
he
heard
the
sentence
against
the
inhabitants
of
sodom
he
prayed
that
the
lord
should
not
execute
it
till
he
had
ascertained
whether
they
all
merited
such
punishment
for
he
said
see
peradventure
there
be
fifty
righteous
within
the
city
and
in
accordance
with
this
belief
god
was
revealed
to
him
as
abraham
imagined
he
spake
thus
i
will
go
down
now
and
see
whether
they
have
done
altogether
according
to
the
cry
of
it
which
is
come
unto
me
and
if
not
i
will
know
further
the
divine
testimony
concerning
abraham
asserts
nothing
but
that
he
was
obedient
and
that
he
commanded
his
household
after
him
that
they
should
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
it
does
not
state
that
he
held
sublime
conceptions
of
the
deity
moses
also
was
not
sufficiently
aware
that
god
is
omniscient
and
directs
human
actions
by
his
sole
decree
for
although
god
himself
says
that
the
israelites
should
hearken
to
him
moses
still
considered
the
matter
doubtful
and
repeated
but
if
they
will
not
believe
me
nor
hearken
unto
my
voice
to
him
in
like
manner
god
was
revealed
as
taking
no
part
in
and
as
being
ignorant
of
future
human
actions
the
lord
gave
him
two
signs
and
said
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
if
they
will
not
believe
thee
neither
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
first
sign
that
they
will
believe
the
voice
of
the
latter
sign
but
if
not
thou
shalt
take
of
the
water
of
the
river
indeed
if
any
one
considers
without
prejudice
the
recorded
opinions
of
moses
he
will
plainly
see
that
moses
conceived
the
deity
as
a
being
who
has
always
existed
does
exist
and
always
will
exist
and
for
this
cause
he
calls
him
by
the
name
jehovah
which
in
hebrew
signifies
these
three
phases
of
existence
as
to
his
nature
moses
only
taught
that
he
is
merciful
gracious
and
exceeding
jealous
as
appears
from
many
passages
in
the
pentateuch
lastly
he
believed
and
taught
that
this
being
was
so
different
from
all
other
beings
that
he
could
not
be
expressed
by
the
image
of
any
visible
thing
also
that
he
could
not
be
looked
upon
and
that
not
so
much
from
inherent
impossibility
as
from
human
infirmity
further
that
by
reason
of
his
power
he
was
without
equal
and
unique
moses
admitted
indeed
that
there
were
beings
doubtless
by
the
plan
and
command
of
the
lord
who
acted
as
god
vicegerents
that
is
beings
to
whom
god
had
given
the
right
authority
and
power
to
direct
nations
and
to
provide
and
care
for
them
but
he
taught
that
this
being
whom
they
were
bound
to
obey
was
the
highest
and
supreme
god
or
to
use
the
hebrew
phrase
god
of
gods
and
thus
in
the
song
exod
he
exclaims
who
is
like
unto
thee
lord
among
the
gods
and
jethro
says
exod
now
i
know
that
the
lord
is
greater
than
all
gods
that
is
to
say
i
am
at
length
compelled
to
admit
to
moses
that
jehovah
is
greater
than
all
gods
and
that
his
power
is
unrivalled
we
must
remain
in
doubt
whether
moses
thought
that
these
beings
who
acted
as
god
vicegerents
were
created
by
him
for
he
has
stated
nothing
so
far
as
we
know
about
their
creation
and
origin
he
further
taught
that
this
being
had
brought
the
visible
world
into
order
from
chaos
and
had
given
nature
her
germs
and
therefore
that
he
possesses
supreme
right
and
power
over
all
things
further
that
by
reason
of
this
supreme
right
and
power
he
had
chosen
for
himself
alone
the
hebrew
nation
and
a
certain
strip
of
territory
and
had
handed
over
to
the
care
of
other
gods
substituted
by
himself
the
rest
of
the
nations
and
territories
and
that
therefore
he
was
called
the
god
of
israel
and
the
god
of
jerusalem
whereas
the
other
gods
were
called
the
gods
of
the
gentiles
for
this
reason
the
jews
believed
that
the
strip
of
territory
which
god
had
chosen
for
himself
demanded
a
divine
worship
quite
apart
and
different
from
the
worship
which
obtained
elsewhere
and
that
the
lord
would
not
suffer
the
worship
of
other
gods
adapted
to
other
countries
thus
they
thought
that
the
people
whom
the
king
of
assyria
had
brought
into
judaea
were
torn
in
pieces
by
lions
because
they
knew
not
the
worship
of
the
national
divinity
kings
jacob
according
to
aben
ezra
opinion
therefore
admonished
his
sons
when
he
wished
them
to
seek
out
a
new
country
that
they
should
prepare
themselves
for
a
new
worship
and
lay
aside
the
worship
of
strange
gods
that
is
of
the
gods
of
the
land
where
they
were
david
in
telling
saul
that
he
was
compelled
by
the
king
persecution
to
live
away
from
his
country
said
that
he
was
driven
out
from
the
heritage
of
the
lord
and
sent
to
worship
other
gods
sam
lastly
he
believed
that
this
being
or
deity
had
his
habitation
in
the
heavens
deut
an
opinion
very
common
among
the
gentiles
if
we
now
examine
the
revelations
to
moses
we
shall
find
that
they
were
accommodated
to
these
opinions
as
he
believed
that
the
divine
nature
was
subject
to
the
conditions
of
mercy
graciousness
so
god
was
revealed
to
him
in
accordance
with
his
idea
and
under
these
attributes
see
exodus
and
the
second
commandment
further
it
is
related
ex
that
moses
asked
of
god
that
he
might
behold
him
but
as
moses
as
we
have
said
had
formed
no
mental
image
of
god
and
god
as
i
have
shown
only
revealed
himself
to
the
prophets
in
accordance
with
the
disposition
of
their
imagination
he
did
not
reveal
himself
in
any
form
this
i
repeat
was
because
the
imagination
of
moses
was
unsuitable
for
other
prophets
bear
witness
that
they
saw
the
lord
for
instance
isaiah
ezekiel
daniel
for
this
reason
god
answered
moses
thou
canst
not
see
my
face
and
inasmuch
as
moses
believed
that
god
can
be
looked
upon
that
is
that
no
contradiction
of
the
divine
nature
is
therein
involved
for
otherwise
he
would
never
have
preferred
his
request
it
is
added
for
no
one
shall
look
on
me
and
live
thus
giving
a
reason
in
accordance
with
moses
idea
for
it
is
not
stated
that
a
contradiction
of
the
divine
nature
would
be
involved
as
was
really
the
case
but
that
the
thing
would
not
come
to
pass
because
of
human
infirmity
when
god
would
reveal
to
moses
that
the
israelites
because
they
worshipped
the
calf
were
to
be
placed
in
the
same
category
as
other
nations
he
said
ch
that
he
would
send
an
angel
that
is
a
being
who
should
have
charge
of
the
israelites
instead
of
the
supreme
being
and
that
he
himself
would
no
longer
remain
among
them
thus
leaving
moses
no
ground
for
supposing
that
the
israelites
were
more
beloved
by
god
than
the
other
nations
whose
guardianship
he
had
entrusted
to
other
beings
or
angels
vide
verse
lastly
as
moses
believed
that
god
dwelt
in
the
heavens
god
was
revealed
to
him
as
coming
down
from
heaven
on
to
a
mountain
and
in
order
to
talk
with
the
lord
moses
went
up
the
mountain
which
he
certainly
need
not
have
done
if
he
could
have
conceived
of
god
as
omnipresent
the
israelites
knew
scarcely
anything
of
god
although
he
was
revealed
to
them
and
this
is
abundantly
evident
from
their
transferring
a
few
days
afterwards
the
honour
and
worship
due
to
him
to
a
calf
which
they
believed
to
be
the
god
who
had
brought
them
out
of
egypt
in
truth
it
is
hardly
likely
that
men
accustomed
to
the
superstitions
of
egypt
uncultivated
and
sunk
in
most
abject
slavery
should
have
held
any
sound
notions
about
the
deity
or
that
moses
should
have
taught
them
anything
beyond
a
rule
of
right
living
inculcating
it
not
like
a
philosopher
as
the
result
of
freedom
but
like
a
lawgiver
compelling
them
to
be
moral
by
legal
authority
thus
the
rule
of
right
living
the
worship
and
love
of
god
was
to
them
rather
a
bondage
than
the
true
liberty
the
gift
and
grace
of
the
deity
moses
bid
them
love
god
and
keep
his
law
because
they
had
in
the
past
received
benefits
from
him
such
as
the
deliverance
from
slavery
in
egypt
and
further
terrified
them
with
threats
if
they
transgressed
his
commands
holding
out
many
promises
of
good
if
they
should
observe
them
thus
treating
them
as
parents
treat
irrational
children
it
is
therefore
certain
that
they
knew
not
the
excellence
of
virtue
and
the
true
happiness
jonah
thought
that
he
was
fleeing
from
the
sight
of
god
which
seems
to
show
that
he
too
held
that
god
had
entrusted
the
care
of
the
nations
outside
judaea
to
other
substituted
powers
no
one
in
the
whole
of
the
old
testament
speaks
more
rationally
of
god
than
solomon
who
in
fact
surpassed
all
the
men
of
his
time
in
natural
ability
yet
he
considered
himself
above
the
law
esteeming
it
only
to
have
been
given
for
men
without
reasonable
and
intellectual
grounds
for
their
actions
and
made
small
account
of
the
laws
concerning
kings
which
are
mainly
three
nay
he
openly
violated
them
in
this
he
did
wrong
and
acted
in
a
manner
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
by
indulging
in
sensual
pleasure
and
taught
that
all
fortune
favours
to
mankind
are
vanity
that
humanity
has
no
nobler
gift
than
wisdom
and
no
greater
punishment
than
folly
see
proverbs
but
let
us
return
to
the
prophets
whose
conflicting
opinions
we
have
undertaken
to
note
the
expressed
ideas
of
ezekiel
seemed
so
diverse
from
those
of
moses
to
the
rabbis
who
have
left
us
the
extant
prophetic
books
as
is
told
in
the
treatise
of
sabbathus
that
they
had
serious
thoughts
of
omitting
his
prophecy
from
the
canon
and
would
doubtless
have
thus
excluded
it
if
a
certain
hananiah
had
not
undertaken
to
explain
it
a
task
which
as
is
there
narrated
he
with
great
zeal
and
labour
accomplished
how
he
did
so
does
not
sufficiently
appear
whether
it
was
by
writing
a
commentary
which
has
now
perished
or
by
altering
ezekiel
words
and
audaciously
striking
out
phrases
according
to
his
fancy
however
this
may
be
chapter
xviii
certainly
does
not
seem
to
agree
with
exodus
jeremiah
samuel
believed
that
the
lord
never
repented
of
anything
he
had
decreed
sam
for
when
saul
was
sorry
for
his
sin
and
wished
to
worship
god
and
ask
for
forgiveness
samuel
said
that
the
lord
would
not
go
back
from
his
decree
to
jeremiah
on
the
other
hand
it
was
revealed
that
if
that
nation
against
whom
i
the
lord
have
pronounced
turn
from
their
evil
i
will
repent
of
the
evil
that
i
thought
to
do
unto
them
if
it
do
evil
in
my
sight
that
it
obey
not
my
voice
then
i
will
repent
of
the
good
wherewith
i
said
i
would
benefit
them
jer
joel
taught
that
the
lord
repented
him
only
of
evil
lastly
it
is
clear
from
gen
iv
that
a
man
can
overcome
the
temptations
of
sin
and
act
righteously
for
this
doctrine
is
told
to
cain
though
as
we
learn
from
josephus
and
the
scriptures
he
never
did
so
overcome
them
and
this
agrees
with
the
chapter
of
jeremiah
just
cited
for
it
is
there
said
that
the
lord
repents
of
the
good
or
the
evil
pronounced
if
the
men
in
question
change
their
ways
and
manner
of
life
but
on
the
other
hand
paul
teaches
as
plainly
as
possible
that
men
have
no
control
over
the
temptations
of
the
flesh
save
by
the
special
vocation
and
grace
of
god
and
when
rom
and
he
attributes
righteousness
to
man
he
corrects
himself
as
speaking
merely
humanly
and
through
the
infirmity
of
the
flesh
we
have
now
more
than
sufficiently
proved
our
point
that
god
adapted
revelations
to
the
understanding
and
opinions
of
the
prophets
and
that
in
matters
of
theory
without
bearing
on
charity
or
morality
the
prophets
could
be
and
in
fact
were
ignorant
and
held
conflicting
opinions
it
therefore
follows
that
we
must
by
no
means
go
to
the
prophets
for
knowledge
either
of
natural
or
of
spiritual
phenomena
we
have
determined
then
that
we
are
only
bound
to
believe
in
the
prophetic
writings
the
object
and
substance
of
the
revelation
with
regard
to
the
details
every
one
may
believe
or
not
as
he
likes
for
instance
the
revelation
to
cain
only
teaches
us
that
god
admonished
him
to
lead
the
true
life
for
such
alone
is
the
object
and
substance
of
the
revelation
not
doctrines
concerning
free
will
and
philosophy
hence
though
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
clearly
implied
in
the
words
of
the
admonition
we
are
at
liberty
to
hold
a
contrary
opinion
since
the
words
and
reasons
were
adapted
to
the
understanding
of
cain
so
too
the
revelation
to
micaiah
would
only
teach
that
god
revealed
to
him
the
true
issue
of
the
battle
between
ahab
and
aram
and
this
is
all
we
are
bound
to
believe
whatever
else
is
contained
in
the
revelation
concerning
the
true
and
the
false
spirit
of
god
the
army
of
heaven
standing
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
and
all
the
other
details
does
not
affect
us
at
all
everyone
may
believe
as
much
of
it
as
his
reason
allows
the
reasonings
by
which
the
lord
displayed
his
power
to
job
if
they
really
were
a
revelation
and
the
author
of
the
history
is
narrating
and
not
merely
as
some
suppose
rhetorically
adorning
his
own
conceptions
would
come
under
the
same
category
that
is
they
were
adapted
to
understanding
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
him
and
are
not
universal
or
for
the
convincing
of
all
men
we
can
come
to
no
different
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
reasonings
of
christ
by
which
he
convicted
the
pharisees
of
pride
and
ignorance
and
exhorted
his
disciples
to
lead
the
true
life
he
adapted
them
to
each
man
opinions
and
principles
for
instance
when
he
said
to
the
pharisees
matt
and
if
satan
cast
out
devils
his
house
is
divided
against
itself
how
then
shall
his
kingdom
stand
he
only
wished
to
convince
the
pharisees
according
to
their
own
principles
not
to
teach
that
there
are
devils
or
any
kingdom
of
devils
so
too
when
he
said
to
his
disciples
matt
see
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
for
i
say
unto
you
that
their
angels
he
merely
desired
to
warn
them
against
pride
and
despising
any
of
their
fellows
not
to
insist
on
the
actual
reason
given
which
was
simply
adopted
in
order
to
persuade
them
more
easily
lastly
we
should
say
exactly
the
same
of
the
apostolic
signs
and
reasonings
but
there
is
no
need
to
go
further
into
the
subject
if
i
were
to
enumerate
all
the
passages
of
scripture
addressed
only
to
individuals
or
to
a
particular
man
understanding
and
which
can
not
without
great
danger
to
philosophy
be
defended
as
divine
doctrines
i
should
go
far
beyond
the
brevity
at
which
i
aim
let
it
suffice
then
to
have
indicated
a
few
instances
of
general
application
and
let
the
curious
reader
consider
others
by
himself
although
the
points
we
have
just
raised
concerning
prophets
and
prophecy
are
the
only
ones
which
have
any
direct
bearing
on
the
end
in
view
namely
the
separation
of
philosophy
from
theology
still
as
i
have
touched
on
the
general
question
i
may
here
inquire
whether
the
gift
of
prophecy
was
peculiar
to
the
hebrews
or
whether
it
was
common
to
all
nations
i
must
then
come
to
a
conclusion
about
the
vocation
of
the
hebrews
all
of
which
i
shall
do
in
the
ensuing
chapter
chapter
iii
of
the
vocation
of
the
hebrews
and
whether
the
gift
of
prophecy
was
peculiar
to
them
every
man
true
happiness
and
blessedness
consist
solely
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
is
good
not
in
the
pride
that
he
alone
is
enjoying
it
to
the
exclusion
of
others
he
who
thinks
himself
the
more
blessed
because
he
is
enjoying
benefits
which
others
are
not
or
because
he
is
more
blessed
or
more
fortunate
than
his
fellows
is
ignorant
of
true
happiness
and
blessedness
and
the
joy
which
he
feels
is
either
childish
or
envious
and
malicious
for
instance
a
man
true
happiness
consists
only
in
wisdom
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
not
at
all
in
the
fact
that
he
is
wiser
than
others
or
that
others
lack
such
knowledge
such
considerations
do
not
increase
his
wisdom
or
true
happiness
whoever
therefore
rejoices
for
such
reasons
rejoices
in
misfortune
and
is
so
far
malicious
and
bad
knowing
neither
true
happiness
nor
the
peace
of
the
true
life
when
scripture
therefore
in
exhorting
the
hebrews
to
obey
the
law
says
that
the
lord
has
chosen
them
for
himself
before
other
nations
deut
that
he
is
near
them
but
not
near
others
deut
that
to
them
alone
he
has
given
just
laws
deut
and
lastly
that
he
has
marked
them
out
before
others
deut
it
speaks
only
according
to
the
understanding
of
its
hearers
who
as
we
have
shown
in
the
last
chapter
and
as
moses
also
testifies
deut
knew
not
true
blessedness
for
in
good
sooth
they
would
have
been
no
less
blessed
if
god
had
called
all
men
equally
to
salvation
nor
would
god
have
been
less
present
to
them
for
being
equally
present
to
others
their
laws
would
have
been
no
less
just
if
they
had
been
ordained
for
all
and
they
themselves
would
have
been
no
less
wise
the
miracles
would
have
shown
god
power
no
less
by
being
wrought
for
other
nations
also
lastly
the
hebrews
would
have
been
just
as
much
bound
to
worship
god
if
he
had
bestowed
all
these
gifts
equally
on
all
men
when
god
tells
solomon
kings
that
no
one
shall
be
as
wise
as
he
in
time
to
come
it
seems
to
be
only
a
manner
of
expressing
surpassing
wisdom
it
is
little
to
be
believed
that
god
would
have
promised
solomon
for
his
greater
happiness
that
he
would
never
endow
anyone
with
so
much
wisdom
in
time
to
come
this
would
in
no
wise
have
increased
intellect
and
the
wise
king
would
have
given
equal
thanks
to
the
lord
if
everyone
had
been
gifted
with
the
same
faculties
still
though
we
assert
that
moses
in
the
passages
of
the
pentateuch
just
cited
spoke
only
according
to
the
understanding
of
the
hebrews
we
have
no
wish
to
deny
that
god
ordained
the
mosaic
law
for
them
alone
nor
that
he
spoke
to
them
alone
nor
that
they
witnessed
marvels
beyond
those
which
happened
to
any
other
nation
but
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
moses
desired
to
admonish
the
hebrews
in
such
a
manner
and
with
such
reasonings
as
would
appeal
most
forcibly
to
their
childish
understanding
and
constrain
them
to
worship
the
deity
further
we
wished
to
show
that
the
hebrews
did
not
surpass
other
nations
in
knowledge
or
in
piety
but
evidently
in
some
attribute
different
from
these
or
to
speak
like
the
scriptures
according
to
their
understanding
that
the
hebrews
were
not
chosen
by
god
before
others
for
the
sake
of
the
true
life
and
sublime
ideas
though
they
were
often
thereto
admonished
but
with
some
other
object
what
that
object
was
i
will
duly
show
but
before
i
begin
i
wish
in
a
few
words
to
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
guidance
of
god
by
the
help
of
god
external
and
inward
and
lastly
what
i
understand
by
fortune
by
the
help
of
god
i
mean
the
fixed
and
unchangeable
order
of
nature
or
the
chain
of
natural
events
for
i
have
said
before
and
shown
elsewhere
that
the
universal
laws
of
nature
according
to
which
all
things
exist
and
are
determined
are
only
another
name
for
the
eternal
decrees
of
god
which
always
involve
eternal
truth
and
necessity
so
that
to
say
that
everything
happens
according
to
natural
laws
and
to
say
that
everything
is
ordained
by
the
decree
and
ordinance
of
god
is
the
same
thing
now
since
the
power
in
nature
is
identical
with
the
power
of
god
by
which
alone
all
things
happen
and
are
determined
it
follows
that
whatsoever
man
as
a
part
of
nature
provides
himself
with
to
aid
and
preserve
his
existence
or
whatsoever
nature
affords
him
without
his
help
is
given
to
him
solely
by
the
divine
power
acting
either
through
human
nature
or
through
external
circumstance
so
whatever
human
nature
can
furnish
itself
with
by
its
own
efforts
to
preserve
its
existence
may
be
fitly
called
the
inward
aid
of
god
whereas
whatever
else
accrues
to
man
profit
from
outward
causes
may
be
called
the
external
aid
of
god
we
can
now
easily
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
election
of
god
for
since
no
one
can
do
anything
save
by
the
predetermined
order
of
nature
that
is
by
god
eternal
ordinance
and
decree
it
follows
that
no
one
can
choose
a
plan
of
life
for
himself
or
accomplish
any
work
save
by
vocation
choosing
him
for
the
work
or
the
plan
of
life
in
question
rather
than
any
other
lastly
by
fortune
i
mean
the
ordinance
of
god
in
so
far
as
it
directs
human
life
through
external
and
unexpected
means
with
these
preliminaries
i
return
to
my
purpose
of
discovering
the
reason
why
the
hebrews
were
said
to
be
elected
by
god
before
other
nations
and
with
the
demonstration
i
thus
proceed
all
objects
of
legitimate
desire
fall
generally
speaking
under
one
of
these
three
categories
the
knowledge
of
things
through
their
primary
causes
the
government
of
the
passions
or
the
acquirement
of
the
habit
of
virtue
secure
and
healthy
life
the
means
which
most
directly
conduce
towards
the
first
two
of
these
ends
and
which
may
be
considered
their
proximate
and
efficient
causes
are
contained
in
human
nature
itself
so
that
their
acquisition
hinges
only
on
our
own
power
and
on
the
laws
of
human
nature
it
may
be
concluded
that
these
gifts
are
not
peculiar
to
any
nation
but
have
always
been
shared
by
the
whole
human
race
unless
indeed
we
would
indulge
the
dream
that
nature
formerly
created
men
of
different
kinds
but
the
means
which
conduce
to
security
and
health
are
chiefly
in
external
circumstance
and
are
called
the
gifts
of
fortune
because
they
depend
chiefly
on
objective
causes
of
which
we
are
ignorant
for
a
fool
may
be
almost
as
liable
to
happiness
or
unhappiness
as
a
wise
man
nevertheless
human
management
and
watchfulness
can
greatly
assist
towards
living
in
security
and
warding
off
the
injuries
of
our
and
even
of
beasts
reason
and
experience
show
no
more
certain
means
of
attaining
this
object
than
the
formation
of
a
society
with
fixed
laws
the
occupation
of
a
strip
of
territory
and
the
concentration
of
all
forces
as
it
were
into
one
body
that
is
the
social
body
now
for
forming
and
preserving
a
society
no
ordinary
ability
and
care
is
required
that
society
will
be
most
secure
most
stable
and
least
liable
to
reverses
which
is
founded
and
directed
by
and
careful
men
while
on
the
other
hand
a
society
constituted
by
men
without
trained
skill
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
fortune
and
is
less
constant
if
in
spite
of
all
such
a
society
lasts
a
long
time
it
is
owing
to
some
other
directing
influence
than
its
own
if
it
overcomes
great
perils
and
its
affairs
prosper
it
will
perforce
marvel
at
and
adore
the
guiding
spirit
of
god
in
so
far
that
is
as
god
works
through
hidden
means
and
not
through
the
nature
and
mind
of
man
for
everything
happens
to
it
unexpectedly
and
contrary
to
anticipation
it
may
even
be
said
and
thought
to
be
by
miracle
nations
then
are
distinguished
from
one
another
in
respect
to
the
social
organization
and
the
laws
under
which
they
live
and
are
governed
the
hebrew
nation
was
not
chosen
by
god
in
respect
to
its
wisdom
nor
its
tranquillity
of
mind
but
in
respect
to
its
social
organization
and
the
good
fortune
with
which
it
obtained
supremacy
and
kept
it
so
many
years
this
is
abundantly
clear
from
scripture
even
a
cursory
perusal
will
show
us
that
the
only
respects
in
which
the
hebrews
surpassed
other
nations
are
in
their
successful
conduct
of
matters
relating
to
government
and
in
their
surmounting
great
perils
solely
by
god
external
aid
in
other
ways
they
were
on
a
par
with
their
fellows
and
god
was
equally
gracious
to
all
for
in
respect
to
intellect
as
we
have
shown
in
the
last
chapter
they
held
very
ordinary
ideas
about
god
and
nature
so
that
they
can
not
have
been
god
chosen
in
this
respect
nor
were
they
so
chosen
in
respect
of
virtue
and
the
true
life
for
here
again
they
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
elect
were
on
an
equality
with
other
nations
therefore
their
choice
and
vocation
consisted
only
in
the
temporal
happiness
and
advantages
of
independent
rule
in
fact
we
do
not
see
that
god
promised
anything
beyond
this
to
the
patriarchs
endnote
or
their
successors
in
the
law
no
other
reward
is
offered
for
obedience
than
the
continual
happiness
of
an
independent
commonwealth
and
other
goods
of
this
life
while
on
the
other
hand
against
contumacy
and
the
breaking
of
the
covenant
is
threatened
the
downfall
of
the
commonwealth
and
great
hardships
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
the
ends
of
every
social
organization
and
commonwealth
are
as
appears
from
what
we
have
said
and
as
we
will
explain
more
at
length
hereafter
security
and
comfort
a
commonwealth
can
only
exist
by
the
laws
being
binding
on
all
if
all
the
members
of
a
state
wish
to
disregard
the
law
by
that
very
fact
they
dissolve
the
state
and
destroy
the
commonwealth
thus
the
only
reward
which
could
be
promised
to
the
hebrews
for
continued
obedience
to
the
law
was
security
endnote
and
its
attendant
advantages
while
no
surer
punishment
could
be
threatened
for
disobedience
than
the
ruin
of
the
state
and
the
evils
which
generally
follow
therefrom
in
addition
to
such
further
consequences
as
might
accrue
to
the
jews
in
particular
from
the
ruin
of
their
especial
state
but
there
is
no
need
here
to
go
into
this
point
at
more
length
i
will
only
add
that
the
laws
of
the
old
testament
were
revealed
and
ordained
to
the
jews
only
for
as
god
chose
them
in
respect
to
the
special
constitution
of
their
society
and
government
they
must
of
course
have
had
special
laws
whether
god
ordained
special
laws
for
other
nations
also
and
revealed
himself
to
their
lawgivers
prophetically
that
is
under
the
attributes
by
which
the
latter
were
accustomed
to
imagine
him
i
can
not
sufficiently
determine
it
is
evident
from
scripture
itself
that
other
nations
acquired
supremacy
and
particular
laws
by
the
external
aid
of
god
witness
only
the
two
following
passages
in
genesis
it
is
related
that
melchisedek
was
king
of
jerusalem
and
priest
of
the
most
high
god
that
in
exercise
of
his
priestly
functions
he
blessed
abraham
and
that
abraham
the
beloved
of
the
lord
gave
to
this
priest
of
god
a
tithe
of
all
his
spoils
this
sufficiently
shows
that
before
he
founded
the
israelitish
nation
god
constituted
kings
and
priests
in
jerusalem
and
ordained
for
them
rites
and
laws
whether
he
did
so
prophetically
is
as
i
have
said
not
sufficiently
clear
but
i
am
sure
of
this
that
abraham
whilst
he
sojourned
in
the
city
lived
scrupulously
according
to
these
laws
for
abraham
had
received
no
special
rites
from
god
and
yet
it
is
stated
that
he
observed
the
worship
the
precepts
the
statutes
and
the
laws
of
god
which
must
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
worship
the
statutes
the
precepts
and
the
laws
of
king
melchisedek
malachi
chides
the
jews
as
follows
who
is
there
among
you
that
will
shut
the
doors
of
the
temple
neither
do
ye
kindle
fire
on
mine
altar
for
nought
i
have
no
pleasure
in
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
for
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
even
until
the
going
down
of
the
same
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
gentiles
and
in
every
place
incense
shall
be
offered
in
my
name
and
a
pure
offering
for
my
name
is
great
among
the
heathen
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
these
words
which
unless
we
do
violence
to
them
could
only
refer
to
the
current
period
abundantly
testify
that
the
jews
of
that
time
were
not
more
beloved
by
god
than
other
nations
that
god
then
favoured
other
nations
with
more
miracles
than
he
vouchsafed
to
the
jews
who
had
then
partly
recovered
their
empire
without
miraculous
aid
and
lastly
that
the
gentiles
possessed
rites
and
ceremonies
acceptable
to
god
but
i
pass
over
these
points
lightly
it
is
enough
for
my
purpose
to
have
shown
that
the
election
of
the
jews
had
regard
to
nothing
but
temporal
physical
happiness
and
freedom
in
other
words
autonomous
government
and
to
the
manner
and
means
by
which
they
obtained
it
consequently
to
the
laws
in
so
far
as
they
were
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
that
special
government
and
lastly
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
revealed
in
regard
to
other
matters
wherein
man
true
happiness
consists
they
were
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
the
nations
when
therefore
it
is
said
in
scripture
deut
that
the
lord
is
not
so
nigh
to
any
other
nation
as
he
is
to
the
jews
reference
is
only
made
to
their
government
and
to
the
period
when
so
many
miracles
happened
to
them
for
in
respect
of
intellect
and
virtue
that
is
in
respect
of
blessedness
god
was
as
we
have
said
already
and
are
now
demonstrating
equally
gracious
to
all
scripture
itself
bears
testimony
to
this
fact
for
the
psalmist
says
the
lord
is
near
unto
all
them
that
call
upon
him
to
all
that
call
upon
him
in
truth
so
in
the
same
psalm
verse
the
lord
is
good
to
all
and
his
tender
mercies
are
over
all
his
works
in
ps
it
is
clearly
stated
that
god
has
granted
to
all
men
the
same
intellect
in
these
words
he
fashioneth
their
hearts
alike
the
heart
was
considered
by
the
hebrews
as
i
suppose
everyone
knows
to
be
the
seat
of
the
soul
and
the
intellect
lastly
from
job
it
is
plain
that
god
had
ordained
for
the
whole
human
race
the
law
to
reverence
god
to
keep
from
evil
doing
or
to
do
well
and
that
job
although
a
gentile
was
of
all
men
most
acceptable
to
god
because
he
exceeded
all
in
piety
and
religion
lastly
from
jonah
it
is
very
evident
that
not
only
to
the
jews
but
to
all
men
god
was
gracious
merciful
suffering
and
of
great
goodness
and
repented
him
of
the
evil
for
jonah
says
therefore
i
determined
to
flee
before
unto
tarshish
for
i
know
that
thou
art
a
gracious
god
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
that
therefore
god
would
pardon
the
ninevites
we
conclude
therefore
inasmuch
as
god
is
to
all
men
equally
gracious
and
the
hebrews
were
only
chosen
by
him
in
respect
to
their
social
organization
and
government
that
the
individual
jew
taken
apart
from
his
social
organization
and
government
possessed
no
gift
of
god
above
other
men
and
that
there
was
no
difference
between
jew
and
gentile
as
it
is
a
fact
that
god
is
equally
gracious
merciful
and
the
rest
to
all
men
and
as
the
function
of
the
prophet
was
to
teach
men
not
so
much
the
laws
of
their
country
as
true
virtue
and
to
exhort
them
thereto
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
all
nations
possessed
prophets
and
that
the
prophetic
gift
was
not
peculiar
to
the
jews
indeed
history
both
profane
and
sacred
bears
witness
to
the
fact
although
from
the
sacred
histories
of
the
old
testament
it
is
not
evident
that
the
other
nations
had
as
many
prophets
as
the
hebrews
or
that
any
gentile
prophet
was
expressly
sent
by
god
to
the
nations
this
does
not
affect
the
question
for
the
hebrews
were
careful
to
record
their
own
affairs
not
those
of
other
nations
it
suffices
then
that
we
find
in
the
old
testament
gentiles
and
uncircumcised
as
noah
enoch
abimelech
balaam
exercising
prophetic
gifts
further
that
hebrew
prophets
were
sent
by
god
not
only
to
their
own
nation
but
to
many
others
also
ezekiel
prophesied
to
all
the
nations
then
known
obadiah
to
none
that
we
are
aware
of
save
the
idumeans
and
jonah
was
chiefly
the
prophet
to
the
ninevites
isaiah
bewails
and
predicts
the
calamities
and
hails
the
restoration
not
only
of
the
jews
but
also
of
other
nations
for
he
says
chap
therefore
i
will
bewail
jazer
with
weeping
and
in
chap
xix
he
foretells
first
the
calamities
and
then
the
restoration
of
the
egyptians
see
verses
saying
that
god
shall
send
them
a
saviour
to
free
them
that
the
lord
shall
be
known
in
egypt
and
further
that
the
egyptians
shall
worship
god
with
sacrifice
and
oblation
and
at
last
he
calls
that
nation
the
blessed
egyptian
people
of
god
all
of
which
particulars
are
specially
noteworthy
jeremiah
is
called
not
the
prophet
of
the
hebrew
nation
but
simply
the
prophet
of
the
nations
see
jer
he
also
mournfully
foretells
the
calamities
of
the
nations
and
predicts
their
restoration
for
he
says
of
the
moabites
therefore
will
i
howl
for
moab
and
i
will
cry
out
for
all
moab
verse
and
therefore
mine
heart
shall
sound
for
moab
like
pipes
in
the
end
he
prophesies
their
restoration
as
also
the
restoration
of
the
egyptians
ammonites
and
elamites
wherefore
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
other
nations
also
like
the
jews
had
their
prophets
who
prophesied
to
them
although
scripture
only
makes
mention
of
one
man
balaam
to
whom
the
future
of
the
jews
and
the
other
nations
was
revealed
we
must
not
suppose
that
balaam
prophesied
only
once
for
from
the
narrative
itself
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
he
had
long
previously
been
famous
for
prophesy
and
other
divine
gifts
for
when
balak
bade
him
to
come
to
him
he
said
num
for
i
know
that
he
whom
thou
blessest
is
blessed
and
he
whom
thou
cursest
is
cursed
thus
we
see
that
he
possessed
the
gift
which
god
had
bestowed
on
abraham
further
as
accustomed
to
prophesy
balaam
bade
the
messengers
wait
for
him
till
the
will
of
the
lord
was
revealed
to
him
when
he
prophesied
that
is
when
he
interpreted
the
true
mind
of
god
he
was
wont
to
say
this
of
himself
he
hath
said
which
heard
the
words
of
god
and
knew
the
knowledge
of
the
most
high
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
almighty
falling
into
a
trance
but
having
his
eyes
open
further
after
he
had
blessed
the
hebrews
by
the
command
of
god
he
began
as
was
his
custom
to
prophesy
to
other
nations
and
to
predict
their
future
all
of
which
abundantly
shows
that
he
had
always
been
a
prophet
or
had
often
prophesied
and
as
we
may
also
remark
here
possessed
that
which
afforded
the
chief
certainty
to
prophets
of
the
truth
of
their
prophecy
namely
a
mind
turned
wholly
to
what
is
right
and
good
for
he
did
not
bless
those
whom
he
wished
to
bless
nor
curse
those
whom
he
wished
to
curse
as
balak
supposed
but
only
those
whom
god
wished
to
be
blessed
or
cursed
thus
he
answered
balak
if
balak
should
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
i
can
not
go
beyond
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
do
either
good
or
bad
of
my
own
mind
but
what
the
lord
saith
that
will
i
speak
as
for
god
being
angry
with
him
in
the
way
the
same
happened
to
moses
when
he
set
out
to
egypt
by
the
command
of
the
lord
and
as
to
his
receiving
money
for
prophesying
samuel
did
the
same
sam
if
in
anyway
he
sinned
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
earth
that
doeth
good
and
sinneth
not
eccles
vide
epist
peter
and
jude
his
speeches
must
certainly
have
had
much
weight
with
god
and
his
power
for
cursing
must
assuredly
have
been
very
great
from
the
number
of
times
that
we
find
stated
in
scripture
in
proof
of
god
great
mercy
to
the
jews
that
god
would
not
hear
balaam
and
that
he
changed
the
cursing
to
blessing
see
deut
josh
neh
wherefore
he
was
without
doubt
most
acceptable
to
god
for
the
speeches
and
cursings
of
the
wicked
move
god
not
at
all
as
then
he
was
a
true
prophet
and
nevertheless
joshua
calls
him
a
soothsayer
or
augur
it
is
certain
that
this
title
had
an
honourable
signification
and
that
those
whom
the
gentiles
called
augurs
and
soothsayers
were
true
prophets
while
those
whom
scripture
often
accuses
and
condemns
were
false
soothsayers
who
deceived
the
gentiles
as
false
prophets
deceived
the
jews
indeed
this
is
made
evident
from
other
passages
in
the
bible
whence
we
conclude
that
the
gift
of
prophecy
was
not
peculiar
to
the
jews
but
common
to
all
nations
the
pharisees
however
vehemently
contend
that
this
divine
gift
was
peculiar
to
their
nation
and
that
the
other
nations
foretold
the
future
what
will
superstition
invent
next
by
some
unexplained
diabolical
faculty
the
principal
passage
of
scripture
which
they
cite
by
way
of
confirming
their
theory
with
its
authority
is
exodus
where
moses
says
to
god
for
wherein
shall
it
be
known
here
that
i
and
thy
people
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
is
it
not
in
that
thou
goest
with
us
so
shall
we
be
separated
i
and
thy
people
from
all
the
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
from
this
they
would
infer
that
moses
asked
of
god
that
he
should
be
present
to
the
jews
and
should
reveal
himself
to
them
prophetically
further
that
he
should
grant
this
favour
to
no
other
nation
it
is
surely
absurd
that
moses
should
have
been
jealous
of
presence
among
the
gentiles
or
that
he
should
have
dared
to
ask
any
such
thing
the
act
is
as
moses
knew
that
the
disposition
and
spirit
of
his
nation
was
rebellious
he
clearly
saw
that
they
could
not
carry
out
what
they
had
begun
without
very
great
miracles
and
special
external
aid
from
god
nay
that
without
such
aid
they
must
necessarily
perish
as
it
was
evident
that
god
wished
them
to
be
preserved
he
asked
for
this
special
external
aid
thus
he
says
ex
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
lord
let
my
lord
i
pray
thee
go
among
us
for
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people
the
reason
therefore
for
his
seeking
special
external
aid
from
god
was
the
stiffneckedness
of
the
people
and
it
is
made
still
more
plain
that
he
asked
for
nothing
beyond
this
special
external
aid
by
god
answer
for
god
answered
at
once
verse
of
the
same
chapter
behold
i
make
a
covenant
before
all
thy
people
i
will
do
marvels
such
as
have
not
been
done
in
all
the
earth
nor
in
any
nation
therefore
moses
had
in
view
nothing
beyond
the
special
election
of
the
jews
as
i
have
explained
it
and
made
no
other
request
to
god
i
confess
that
in
paul
epistle
to
the
romans
i
find
another
text
which
carries
more
weight
namely
where
paul
seems
to
teach
a
different
doctrine
from
that
here
set
down
for
he
there
says
rom
what
advantage
then
hath
the
jew
or
what
profit
is
there
of
circumcision
much
every
way
chiefly
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of
god
but
if
we
look
to
the
doctrine
which
paul
especially
desired
to
teach
we
shall
find
nothing
repugnant
to
our
present
contention
on
the
contrary
his
doctrine
is
the
same
as
ours
for
he
says
rom
that
god
is
the
god
of
the
jews
and
of
the
gentiles
and
ch
but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of
the
law
thy
circumcision
is
made
uncircumcision
therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
law
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision
further
in
chap
iv
verse
he
says
that
all
alike
jew
and
gentile
were
under
sin
and
that
without
commandment
and
law
there
is
no
sin
wherefore
it
is
most
evident
that
to
all
men
absolutely
was
revealed
the
law
under
which
all
lived
namely
the
law
which
has
regard
only
to
true
virtue
not
the
law
established
in
respect
to
and
in
the
formation
of
a
particular
state
and
adapted
to
the
disposition
of
a
particular
people
lastly
paul
concludes
that
since
god
is
the
god
of
all
nations
that
is
is
equally
gracious
to
all
and
since
all
men
equally
live
under
the
law
and
under
sin
so
also
to
all
nations
did
god
send
his
christ
to
free
all
men
equally
from
the
bondage
of
the
law
that
they
should
no
more
do
right
by
the
command
of
the
law
but
by
the
constant
determination
of
their
hearts
so
that
paul
teaches
exactly
the
same
as
ourselves
when
therefore
he
says
to
the
jews
only
were
entrusted
the
oracles
of
god
we
must
either
understand
that
to
them
only
were
the
laws
entrusted
in
writing
while
they
were
given
to
other
nations
merely
in
revelation
and
conception
or
else
as
none
but
jews
would
object
to
the
doctrine
he
desired
to
advance
that
paul
was
answering
only
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
and
current
ideas
of
the
jews
for
in
respect
to
teaching
things
which
he
had
partly
seen
partly
heard
he
was
to
the
greeks
a
greek
and
to
the
jews
a
jew
it
now
only
remains
to
us
to
answer
the
arguments
of
those
who
would
persuade
themselves
that
the
election
of
the
jews
was
not
temporal
and
merely
in
respect
of
their
commonwealth
but
eternal
for
they
say
we
see
the
jews
after
the
loss
of
their
commonwealth
and
after
being
scattered
so
many
years
and
separated
from
all
other
nations
still
surviving
which
is
without
parallel
among
other
peoples
and
further
the
scriptures
seem
to
teach
that
god
has
chosen
for
himself
the
jews
for
ever
so
that
though
they
have
lost
their
commonwealth
they
still
nevertheless
remain
god
elect
the
passages
which
they
think
teach
most
clearly
this
eternal
election
are
chiefly
jer
where
the
prophet
testifies
that
the
seed
of
israel
shall
for
ever
remain
the
nation
of
god
comparing
them
with
the
stability
of
the
heavens
and
nature
ezek
where
the
prophet
seems
to
intend
that
though
the
jews
wanted
after
the
help
afforded
them
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
worship
of
the
lord
that
god
would
nevertheless
gather
them
together
again
from
all
the
lands
in
which
they
were
dispersed
and
lead
them
to
the
wilderness
of
the
peoples
as
he
had
led
their
fathers
to
the
wilderness
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
would
at
length
after
purging
out
from
among
them
the
rebels
and
transgressors
bring
them
thence
to
his
holy
mountain
where
the
whole
house
of
israel
should
worship
him
other
passages
are
also
cited
especially
by
the
pharisees
but
i
think
i
shall
satisfy
everyone
if
i
answer
these
two
and
this
i
shall
easily
accomplish
after
showing
from
scripture
itself
that
god
chose
not
the
hebrews
for
ever
but
only
on
the
condition
under
which
he
had
formerly
chosen
the
canaanites
for
these
last
as
we
have
shown
had
priests
who
religiously
worshipped
god
and
whom
god
at
length
rejected
because
of
their
luxury
pride
and
corrupt
worship
moses
lev
warned
the
israelites
that
they
be
not
polluted
with
whoredoms
lest
the
land
spue
them
out
as
it
had
spued
out
the
nations
who
had
dwelt
there
before
and
in
deut
in
the
plainest
terms
he
threatens
their
total
ruin
for
he
says
i
testify
against
you
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
as
the
nations
which
the
lord
destroyeth
before
your
face
so
shall
ye
perish
in
like
manner
many
other
passages
are
found
in
the
law
which
expressly
show
that
god
chose
the
hebrews
neither
absolutely
nor
for
ever
if
then
the
prophets
foretold
for
them
a
new
covenant
of
the
knowledge
of
god
love
and
grace
such
a
promise
is
easily
proved
to
be
only
made
to
the
elect
for
ezekiel
in
the
chapter
which
we
have
just
quoted
expressly
says
that
god
will
separate
from
them
the
rebellious
and
transgressors
and
zephaniah
says
that
god
will
take
away
the
proud
from
the
midst
of
them
and
leave
the
poor
now
inasmuch
as
their
election
has
regard
to
true
virtue
it
is
not
to
be
thought
that
it
was
promised
to
the
jews
alone
to
the
exclusion
of
others
but
we
must
evidently
believe
that
the
true
gentile
prophets
and
every
nation
as
we
have
shown
possessed
such
promised
the
same
to
the
faithful
of
their
own
people
who
were
thereby
comforted
wherefore
this
eternal
covenant
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
love
is
universal
as
is
clear
moreover
from
zeph
no
difference
in
this
respect
can
be
admitted
between
jew
and
gentile
nor
did
the
former
enjoy
any
special
election
beyond
that
which
we
have
pointed
out
when
the
prophets
in
speaking
of
this
election
which
regards
only
true
virtue
mixed
up
much
concerning
sacrifices
and
ceremonies
and
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
and
city
they
wished
by
such
figurative
expressions
after
the
manner
and
nature
of
prophecy
to
expound
matters
spiritual
so
as
at
the
same
time
to
show
to
the
jews
whose
prophets
they
were
the
true
restoration
of
the
state
and
of
the
temple
to
be
expected
about
the
time
of
cyrus
at
the
present
time
therefore
there
is
absolutely
nothing
which
the
jews
can
arrogate
to
themselves
beyond
other
people
as
to
their
continuance
so
long
after
dispersion
and
the
loss
of
empire
there
is
nothing
marvellous
in
it
for
they
so
separated
themselves
from
every
other
nation
as
to
draw
down
upon
themselves
universal
hate
not
only
by
their
outward
rites
rites
conflicting
with
those
of
other
nations
but
also
by
the
sign
of
circumcision
which
they
most
scrupulously
observe
that
they
have
been
preserved
in
great
measure
by
gentile
hatred
experience
demonstrates
when
the
king
of
spain
formerly
compelled
the
jews
to
embrace
the
state
religion
or
to
go
into
exile
a
large
number
of
jews
accepted
catholicism
now
as
these
renegades
were
admitted
to
all
the
native
privileges
of
spaniards
and
deemed
worthy
of
filling
all
honourable
offices
it
came
to
pass
that
they
straightway
became
so
intermingled
with
the
spaniards
as
to
leave
of
themselves
no
relic
or
remembrance
but
exactly
the
opposite
happened
to
those
whom
the
king
of
portugal
compelled
to
become
christians
for
they
always
though
converted
lived
apart
inasmuch
as
they
were
considered
unworthy
of
any
civic
honours
the
sign
of
circumcision
is
as
i
think
so
important
that
i
could
persuade
myself
that
it
alone
would
preserve
the
nation
for
ever
nay
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
believe
that
if
the
foundations
of
their
religion
have
not
emasculated
their
minds
they
may
even
if
occasion
offers
so
changeable
are
human
affairs
raise
up
their
empire
afresh
and
that
god
may
a
second
time
elect
them
of
such
a
possibility
we
have
a
very
famous
example
in
the
chinese
they
too
have
some
distinctive
mark
on
their
heads
which
they
most
scrupulously
observe
and
by
which
they
keep
themselves
apart
from
everyone
else
and
have
thus
kept
themselves
during
so
many
thousand
years
that
they
far
surpass
all
other
nations
in
antiquity
they
have
not
always
retained
empire
but
they
have
recovered
it
when
lost
and
doubtless
will
do
so
again
after
the
spirit
of
the
tartars
becomes
relaxed
through
the
luxury
of
riches
and
pride
lastly
if
any
one
wishes
to
maintain
that
the
jews
from
this
or
from
any
other
cause
have
been
chosen
by
god
for
ever
i
will
not
gainsay
him
if
he
will
admit
that
this
choice
whether
temporary
or
eternal
has
no
regard
in
so
far
as
it
is
peculiar
to
the
jews
to
aught
but
dominion
and
physical
advantages
for
by
such
alone
can
one
nation
be
distinguished
from
another
whereas
in
regard
to
intellect
and
true
virtue
every
nation
is
on
a
par
with
the
rest
and
god
has
not
in
these
respects
chosen
one
people
rather
than
another
chapter
iv
of
the
divine
law
the
word
law
taken
in
the
abstract
means
that
by
which
an
individual
or
all
things
or
as
many
things
as
belong
to
a
particular
species
act
in
one
and
the
same
fixed
and
definite
manner
which
manner
depends
either
on
natural
necessity
or
on
human
decree
a
law
which
depends
on
natural
necessity
is
one
which
necessarily
follows
from
the
nature
or
from
the
definition
of
the
thing
in
question
a
law
which
depends
on
human
decree
and
which
is
more
correctly
called
an
ordinance
is
one
which
men
have
laid
down
for
themselves
and
others
in
order
to
live
more
safely
or
conveniently
or
from
some
similar
reason
for
example
the
law
that
all
bodies
impinging
on
lesser
bodies
lose
as
much
of
their
own
motion
as
they
communicate
to
the
latter
is
a
universal
law
of
all
bodies
and
depends
on
natural
necessity
so
too
the
law
that
a
man
in
remembering
one
thing
straightway
remembers
another
either
like
it
or
which
he
had
perceived
simultaneously
with
it
is
a
law
which
necessarily
follows
from
the
nature
of
man
but
the
law
that
men
must
yield
or
be
compelled
to
yield
somewhat
of
their
natural
right
and
that
they
bind
themselves
to
live
in
a
certain
way
depends
on
human
decree
now
though
i
freely
admit
that
all
things
are
predetermined
by
universal
natural
laws
to
exist
and
operate
in
a
given
fixed
and
definite
manner
i
still
assert
that
the
laws
i
have
just
mentioned
depend
on
human
decree
because
man
in
so
far
as
he
is
a
part
of
nature
constitutes
a
part
of
the
power
of
nature
whatever
therefore
follows
necessarily
from
the
necessity
of
human
nature
that
is
from
nature
herself
in
so
far
as
we
conceive
of
her
as
acting
through
man
follows
even
though
it
be
necessarily
from
human
power
hence
the
sanction
of
such
laws
may
very
well
be
said
to
depend
on
man
decree
for
it
principally
depends
on
the
power
of
the
human
mind
so
that
the
human
mind
in
respect
to
its
perception
of
things
as
true
and
false
can
readily
be
conceived
as
without
such
laws
but
not
without
necessary
law
as
we
have
just
defined
it
i
have
stated
that
these
laws
depend
on
human
decree
because
it
is
well
to
define
and
explain
things
by
their
proximate
causes
the
general
consideration
of
fate
and
the
concatenation
of
causes
would
aid
us
very
little
in
forming
and
arranging
our
ideas
concerning
particular
questions
let
us
add
that
as
to
the
actual
coordination
and
concatenation
of
things
that
is
how
things
are
ordained
and
linked
together
we
are
obviously
ignorant
therefore
it
is
more
profitable
for
right
living
nay
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
consider
things
as
contingent
so
much
about
law
in
the
abstract
now
the
word
law
seems
to
be
only
applied
to
natural
phenomena
by
analogy
and
is
commonly
taken
to
signify
a
command
which
men
can
either
obey
or
neglect
inasmuch
as
it
restrains
human
nature
within
certain
originally
exceeded
limits
and
therefore
lays
down
no
rule
beyond
human
strength
thus
it
is
expedient
to
define
law
more
particularly
as
a
plan
of
life
laid
down
by
man
for
himself
or
others
with
a
certain
object
however
as
the
true
object
of
legislation
is
only
perceived
by
a
few
and
most
men
are
almost
incapable
of
grasping
it
though
they
live
under
its
conditions
legislators
with
a
view
to
exacting
general
obedience
have
wisely
put
forward
another
object
very
different
from
that
which
necessarily
follows
from
the
nature
of
law
they
promise
to
the
observers
of
the
law
that
which
the
masses
chiefly
desire
and
threaten
its
violators
with
that
which
they
chiefly
fear
thus
endeavouring
to
restrain
the
masses
as
far
as
may
be
like
a
horse
with
a
curb
whence
it
follows
that
the
word
law
is
chiefly
applied
to
the
modes
of
life
enjoined
on
men
by
the
sway
of
others
hence
those
who
obey
the
law
are
said
to
live
under
it
and
to
be
under
compulsion
in
truth
a
man
who
renders
everyone
their
due
because
he
fears
the
gallows
acts
under
the
sway
and
compulsion
of
others
and
can
not
be
called
just
but
a
man
who
does
the
same
from
a
knowledge
of
the
true
reason
for
laws
and
their
necessity
acts
from
a
firm
purpose
and
of
his
own
accord
and
is
therefore
properly
called
just
this
i
take
it
is
paul
meaning
when
he
says
that
those
who
live
under
the
law
can
not
be
justified
through
the
law
for
justice
as
commonly
defined
is
the
constant
and
perpetual
will
to
render
every
man
his
due
thus
solomon
says
prov
it
is
a
joy
to
the
just
to
do
judgment
but
the
wicked
fear
law
then
being
a
plan
of
living
which
men
have
for
a
certain
object
laid
down
for
themselves
or
others
may
as
it
seems
be
divided
into
human
law
and
divine
law
but
both
are
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin
by
human
law
i
mean
a
plan
of
living
which
serves
only
to
render
life
and
the
state
secure
by
divine
law
i
mean
that
which
only
regards
the
highest
good
in
other
words
the
true
knowledge
of
god
and
love
i
call
this
law
divine
because
of
the
nature
of
the
highest
good
which
i
will
here
shortly
explain
as
clearly
as
i
can
inasmuch
as
the
intellect
is
the
best
part
of
our
being
it
is
evident
that
we
should
make
every
effort
to
perfect
it
as
far
as
possible
if
we
desire
to
search
for
what
is
really
profitable
to
us
for
in
intellectual
perfection
the
highest
good
should
consist
now
since
all
our
knowledge
and
the
certainty
which
removes
every
doubt
depend
solely
on
the
knowledge
of
god
firstly
because
without
god
nothing
can
exist
or
be
conceived
secondly
because
so
long
as
we
have
no
clear
and
distinct
idea
of
god
we
may
remain
in
universal
doubt
it
follows
that
our
highest
good
and
perfection
also
depend
solely
on
the
knowledge
of
god
further
since
without
god
nothing
can
exist
or
be
conceived
it
is
evident
that
all
natural
phenomena
involve
and
express
the
conception
of
god
as
far
as
their
essence
and
perfection
extend
so
that
we
have
greater
and
more
perfect
knowledge
of
god
in
proportion
to
our
knowledge
of
natural
phenomena
conversely
since
the
knowledge
of
an
effect
through
its
cause
is
the
same
thing
as
the
knowledge
of
a
particular
property
of
a
cause
the
greater
our
knowledge
of
natural
phenomena
the
more
perfect
is
our
knowledge
of
the
essence
of
god
which
is
the
cause
of
all
things
so
then
our
highest
good
not
only
depends
on
the
knowledge
of
god
but
wholly
consists
therein
and
it
further
follows
that
man
is
perfect
or
the
reverse
in
proportion
to
the
nature
and
perfection
of
the
object
of
his
special
desire
hence
the
most
perfect
and
the
chief
sharer
in
the
highest
blessedness
is
he
who
prizes
above
all
else
and
takes
especial
delight
in
the
intellectual
knowledge
of
god
the
most
perfect
being
hither
then
our
highest
good
and
our
highest
blessedness
aim
namely
to
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
therefore
the
means
demanded
by
this
aim
of
all
human
actions
that
is
by
god
in
so
far
as
the
idea
of
him
is
in
us
may
be
called
the
commands
of
god
because
they
proceed
as
it
were
from
god
himself
inasmuch
as
he
exists
in
our
minds
and
the
plan
of
life
which
has
regard
to
this
aim
may
be
fitly
called
the
law
of
god
the
nature
of
the
means
and
the
plan
of
life
which
this
aim
demands
how
the
foundations
of
the
best
states
follow
its
lines
and
how
men
life
is
conducted
are
questions
pertaining
to
general
ethics
here
i
only
proceed
to
treat
of
the
divine
law
in
a
particular
application
as
the
love
of
god
is
man
highest
happiness
and
blessedness
and
the
ultimate
end
and
aim
of
all
human
actions
it
follows
that
he
alone
lives
by
the
divine
law
who
loves
god
not
from
fear
of
punishment
or
from
love
of
any
other
object
such
as
sensual
pleasure
fame
or
the
like
but
solely
because
he
has
knowledge
of
god
or
is
convinced
that
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
is
the
highest
good
the
sum
and
chief
precept
then
of
the
divine
law
is
to
love
god
as
the
highest
good
namely
as
we
have
said
not
from
fear
of
any
pains
and
penalties
or
from
the
love
of
any
other
object
in
which
we
desire
to
take
pleasure
the
idea
of
god
lays
down
the
rule
that
god
is
our
highest
good
in
other
words
that
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
is
the
ultimate
aim
to
which
all
our
actions
should
be
directed
the
worldling
can
not
understand
these
things
they
appear
foolishness
to
him
because
he
has
too
meager
a
knowledge
of
god
and
also
because
in
this
highest
good
he
can
discover
nothing
which
he
can
handle
or
eat
or
which
affects
the
fleshly
appetites
wherein
he
chiefly
delights
for
it
consists
solely
in
thought
and
the
pure
reason
they
on
the
other
hand
who
know
that
they
possess
no
greater
gift
than
intellect
and
sound
reason
will
doubtless
accept
what
i
have
said
without
question
we
have
now
explained
that
wherein
the
divine
law
chiefly
consists
and
what
are
human
laws
namely
all
those
which
have
a
different
aim
unless
they
have
been
ratified
by
revelation
for
in
this
respect
also
things
are
referred
to
god
as
we
have
shown
above
and
in
this
sense
the
law
of
moses
although
it
was
not
universal
but
entirely
adapted
to
the
disposition
and
particular
preservation
of
a
single
people
may
yet
be
called
a
law
of
god
or
divine
law
inasmuch
as
we
believe
that
it
was
ratified
by
prophetic
insight
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
natural
divine
law
as
we
have
just
explained
it
we
shall
see
that
it
is
universal
or
common
to
all
men
for
we
have
deduced
it
from
universal
human
nature
ii
that
it
does
not
depend
on
the
truth
of
any
historical
narrative
whatsoever
for
inasmuch
as
this
natural
divine
law
is
comprehended
solely
by
the
consideration
of
human
nature
it
is
plain
that
we
can
conceive
it
as
existing
as
well
in
adam
as
in
any
other
man
as
well
in
a
man
living
among
his
fellows
as
in
a
man
who
lives
by
himself
the
truth
of
a
historical
narrative
however
assured
can
not
give
us
the
knowledge
nor
consequently
the
love
of
god
for
love
of
god
springs
from
knowledge
of
him
and
knowledge
of
him
should
be
derived
from
general
ideas
in
themselves
certain
and
known
so
that
the
truth
of
a
historical
narrative
is
very
far
from
being
a
necessary
requisite
for
our
attaining
our
highest
good
still
though
the
truth
of
histories
can
not
give
us
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
i
do
not
deny
that
reading
them
is
very
useful
with
a
view
to
life
in
the
world
for
the
more
we
have
observed
and
known
of
men
customs
and
circumstances
which
are
best
revealed
by
their
actions
the
more
warily
we
shall
be
able
to
order
our
lives
among
them
and
so
far
as
reason
dictates
to
adapt
our
actions
to
their
dispositions
iii
we
see
that
this
natural
divine
law
does
not
demand
the
performance
of
ceremonies
that
is
actions
in
themselves
indifferent
which
are
called
good
from
the
fact
of
their
institution
or
actions
symbolizing
something
profitable
for
salvation
or
if
one
prefers
this
definition
actions
of
which
the
meaning
surpasses
human
understanding
the
natural
light
of
reason
does
not
demand
anything
which
it
is
itself
unable
to
supply
but
only
such
as
it
can
very
clearly
show
to
be
good
or
a
means
to
our
blessedness
such
things
as
are
good
simply
because
they
have
been
commanded
or
instituted
or
as
being
symbols
of
something
good
are
mere
shadows
which
can
not
be
reckoned
among
actions
that
are
the
offsprings
as
it
were
or
fruit
of
a
sound
mind
and
of
intellect
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
into
this
now
in
more
detail
iv
lastly
we
see
that
the
highest
reward
of
the
divine
law
is
the
law
itself
namely
to
know
god
and
to
love
him
of
our
free
choice
and
with
an
undivided
and
fruitful
spirit
while
its
penalty
is
the
absence
of
these
things
and
being
in
bondage
to
the
flesh
that
is
having
an
inconstant
and
wavering
spirit
these
points
being
noted
i
must
now
inquire
i
whether
by
the
natural
light
of
reason
we
can
conceive
of
god
as
a
or
potentate
ordaining
laws
for
men
ii
what
is
the
teaching
of
holy
writ
concerning
this
natural
light
of
reason
and
natural
law
iii
with
what
objects
were
ceremonies
formerly
instituted
iv
lastly
what
is
the
good
gained
by
knowing
the
sacred
histories
and
believing
them
of
the
first
two
i
will
treat
in
this
chapter
of
the
remaining
two
in
the
following
one
our
conclusion
about
the
first
is
easily
deduced
from
the
nature
of
god
will
which
is
only
distinguished
from
his
understanding
in
relation
to
our
intellect
that
is
the
will
and
the
understanding
of
god
are
in
reality
one
and
the
same
and
are
only
distinguished
in
relation
to
our
thoughts
which
we
form
concerning
god
understanding
for
instance
if
we
are
only
looking
to
the
fact
that
the
nature
of
a
triangle
is
from
eternity
contained
in
the
divine
nature
as
an
eternal
verity
we
say
that
god
possesses
the
idea
of
a
triangle
or
that
he
understands
the
nature
of
a
triangle
but
if
afterwards
we
look
to
the
fact
that
the
nature
of
a
triangle
is
thus
contained
in
the
divine
nature
solely
by
the
necessity
of
the
divine
nature
and
not
by
the
necessity
of
the
nature
and
essence
of
a
triangle
in
fact
that
the
necessity
of
a
triangle
essence
and
nature
in
so
far
as
they
are
conceived
of
as
eternal
verities
depends
solely
on
the
necessity
of
the
divine
nature
and
intellect
we
then
style
god
will
or
decree
that
which
before
we
styled
his
intellect
wherefore
we
make
one
and
the
same
affirmation
concerning
god
when
we
say
that
he
has
from
eternity
decreed
that
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
angles
as
when
we
say
that
he
has
understood
it
hence
the
affirmations
and
the
negations
of
god
always
involve
necessity
or
truth
so
that
for
example
if
god
said
to
adam
that
he
did
not
wish
him
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
it
would
have
involved
a
contradiction
that
adam
should
have
been
able
to
eat
of
it
and
would
therefore
have
been
impossible
that
he
should
have
so
eaten
for
the
divine
command
would
have
involved
an
eternal
necessity
and
truth
but
since
scripture
nevertheless
narrates
that
god
did
give
this
command
to
adam
and
yet
that
none
the
less
adam
ate
of
the
tree
we
must
perforce
say
that
god
revealed
to
adam
the
evil
which
would
surely
follow
if
he
should
eat
of
the
tree
but
did
not
disclose
that
such
evil
would
of
necessity
come
to
pass
thus
it
was
that
adam
took
the
revelation
to
be
not
an
eternal
and
necessary
truth
but
a
law
that
is
an
ordinance
followed
by
gain
or
loss
not
depending
necessarily
on
the
nature
of
the
act
performed
but
solely
on
the
will
and
absolute
power
of
some
potentate
so
that
the
revelation
in
question
was
solely
in
relation
to
adam
and
solely
through
his
lack
of
knowledge
a
law
and
god
was
as
it
were
a
lawgiver
and
potentate
from
the
same
cause
namely
from
lack
of
knowledge
the
decalogue
in
relation
to
the
hebrews
was
a
law
for
since
they
knew
not
the
existence
of
god
as
an
eternal
truth
they
must
have
taken
as
a
law
that
which
was
revealed
to
them
in
the
decalogue
namely
that
god
exists
and
that
god
only
should
be
worshipped
but
if
god
had
spoken
to
them
without
the
intervention
of
any
bodily
means
immediately
they
would
have
perceived
it
not
as
a
law
but
as
an
eternal
truth
what
we
have
said
about
the
israelites
and
adam
applies
also
to
all
the
prophets
who
wrote
laws
in
god
name
they
did
not
adequately
conceive
god
decrees
as
eternal
truths
for
instance
we
must
say
of
moses
that
from
revelation
from
the
basis
of
what
was
revealed
to
him
he
perceived
the
method
by
which
the
israelitish
nation
could
best
be
united
in
a
particular
territory
and
could
form
a
body
politic
or
state
and
further
that
he
perceived
the
method
by
which
that
nation
could
best
be
constrained
to
obedience
but
he
did
not
perceive
nor
was
it
revealed
to
him
that
this
method
was
absolutely
the
best
nor
that
the
obedience
of
the
people
in
a
certain
strip
of
territory
would
necessarily
imply
the
end
he
had
in
view
wherefore
he
perceived
these
things
not
as
eternal
truths
but
as
precepts
and
ordinances
and
he
ordained
them
as
laws
of
god
and
thus
it
came
to
be
that
he
conceived
god
as
a
ruler
a
legislator
a
king
as
merciful
just
whereas
such
qualities
are
simply
attributes
of
human
nature
and
utterly
alien
from
the
nature
of
the
deity
thus
much
we
may
affirm
of
the
prophets
who
wrote
laws
in
the
name
of
god
but
we
must
not
affirm
it
of
christ
for
christ
although
he
too
seems
to
have
written
laws
in
the
name
of
god
must
be
taken
to
have
had
a
clear
and
adequate
perception
for
christ
was
not
so
much
a
prophet
as
the
mouthpiece
of
god
for
god
made
revelations
to
mankind
through
christ
as
he
had
before
done
through
angels
that
is
a
created
voice
visions
it
would
be
as
unreasonable
to
say
that
god
had
accommodated
his
revelations
to
the
opinions
of
christ
as
that
he
had
before
accommodated
them
to
the
opinions
of
angels
that
is
of
a
created
voice
or
visions
as
matters
to
be
revealed
to
the
prophets
a
wholly
absurd
hypothesis
moreover
christ
was
sent
to
teach
not
only
the
jews
but
the
whole
human
race
and
therefore
it
was
not
enough
that
his
mind
should
be
accommodated
to
the
opinions
the
jews
alone
but
also
to
the
opinion
and
fundamental
teaching
common
to
the
whole
human
race
in
other
words
to
ideas
universal
and
true
inasmuch
as
god
revealed
himself
to
christ
or
to
christ
mind
immediately
and
not
as
to
the
prophets
through
words
and
symbols
we
must
needs
suppose
that
christ
perceived
truly
what
was
revealed
in
other
words
he
understood
it
for
a
matter
is
understood
when
it
is
perceived
simply
by
the
mind
without
words
or
symbols
christ
then
perceived
truly
and
adequately
what
was
revealed
and
if
he
ever
proclaimed
such
revelations
as
laws
he
did
so
because
of
the
ignorance
and
obstinacy
of
the
people
acting
in
this
respect
the
part
of
god
inasmuch
as
he
accommodated
himself
to
the
comprehension
of
the
people
and
though
he
spoke
somewhat
more
clearly
than
the
other
prophets
yet
he
taught
what
was
revealed
obscurely
and
generally
through
parables
especially
when
he
was
speaking
to
those
to
whom
it
was
not
yet
given
to
understand
the
kingdom
of
heaven
see
matt
to
those
to
whom
it
was
given
to
understand
the
mysteries
of
heaven
he
doubtless
taught
his
doctrines
as
eternal
truths
and
did
not
lay
them
down
as
laws
thus
freeing
the
minds
of
his
hearers
from
the
bondage
of
that
law
which
he
further
confirmed
and
established
paul
apparently
points
to
this
more
than
once
rom
and
though
he
never
himself
seems
to
wish
to
speak
openly
but
to
quote
his
own
words
rom
and
merely
humanly
this
he
expressly
states
when
he
calls
god
just
and
it
was
doubtless
in
concession
to
human
weakness
that
he
attributes
mercy
grace
anger
and
similar
qualities
to
god
adapting
his
language
to
the
popular
mind
or
as
he
puts
it
cor
to
carnal
men
in
rom
he
teaches
undisguisedly
that
god
auger
and
mercy
depend
not
on
the
actions
of
men
but
on
god
own
nature
or
will
further
that
no
one
is
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
only
by
faith
which
he
seems
to
identify
with
the
full
assent
of
the
soul
lastly
that
no
one
is
blessed
unless
he
have
in
him
the
mind
of
christ
rom
whereby
he
perceives
the
laws
of
god
as
eternal
truths
we
conclude
therefore
that
god
is
described
as
a
lawgiver
or
prince
and
styled
just
merciful
merely
in
concession
to
popular
understanding
and
the
imperfection
of
popular
knowledge
that
in
reality
god
acts
and
directs
all
things
simply
by
the
necessity
of
his
nature
and
perfection
and
that
his
decrees
and
volitions
are
eternal
truths
and
always
involve
necessity
so
much
for
the
first
point
which
i
wished
to
explain
and
demonstrate
passing
on
to
the
second
point
let
us
search
the
sacred
pages
for
their
teaching
concerning
the
light
of
nature
and
this
divine
law
the
first
doctrine
we
find
in
the
history
of
the
first
man
where
it
is
narrated
that
god
commanded
adam
not
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
this
seems
to
mean
that
god
commanded
adam
to
do
and
to
seek
after
righteousness
because
it
was
good
not
because
the
contrary
was
evil
that
is
to
seek
the
good
for
its
own
sake
not
from
fear
of
evil
we
have
seen
that
he
who
acts
rightly
from
the
true
knowledge
and
love
of
right
acts
with
freedom
and
constancy
whereas
he
who
acts
from
fear
of
evil
is
under
the
constraint
of
evil
and
acts
in
bondage
under
external
control
so
that
this
commandment
of
god
to
adam
comprehends
the
whole
divine
natural
law
and
absolutely
agrees
with
the
dictates
of
the
light
of
nature
nay
it
would
be
easy
to
explain
on
this
basis
the
whole
history
or
allegory
of
the
first
man
but
i
prefer
to
pass
over
the
subject
in
silence
because
in
the
first
place
i
can
not
be
absolutely
certain
that
my
explanation
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
intention
of
the
sacred
writer
and
secondly
because
many
do
not
admit
that
this
history
is
an
allegory
maintaining
it
to
be
a
simple
narrative
of
facts
it
will
be
better
therefore
to
adduce
other
passages
of
scripture
especially
such
as
were
written
by
him
who
speaks
with
all
the
strength
of
his
natural
understanding
in
which
he
surpassed
all
his
contemporaries
and
whose
sayings
are
accepted
by
the
people
as
of
equal
weight
with
those
of
the
prophets
i
mean
solomon
whose
prudence
and
wisdom
are
commended
in
scripture
rather
than
his
piety
and
gift
of
prophecy
life
being
taken
to
mean
the
true
life
as
is
evident
from
deut
the
fruit
of
the
understanding
consists
only
in
the
true
life
and
its
absence
constitutes
punishment
all
this
absolutely
agrees
with
what
was
set
out
in
our
fourth
point
concerning
natural
law
moreover
our
position
that
it
is
the
of
life
and
that
the
intellect
alone
lays
down
laws
for
the
wise
is
plainly
taught
by
the
sage
for
he
says
prov
the
law
of
the
wise
is
a
fountain
of
life
that
is
as
we
gather
from
the
preceding
text
the
understanding
in
chap
he
expressly
teaches
that
the
understanding
renders
man
blessed
and
happy
and
gives
him
true
peace
of
mind
happy
is
the
man
that
findeth
wisdom
and
the
man
that
getteth
understanding
for
wisdom
gives
length
of
days
and
riches
and
honour
her
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
peace
according
to
solomon
therefore
it
is
only
the
wise
who
live
in
peace
and
equanimity
not
like
the
wicked
whose
minds
drift
hither
and
thither
and
as
isaiah
says
chap
are
like
the
troubled
sea
for
them
there
is
no
peace
lastly
we
should
especially
note
the
passage
in
chap
ii
of
proverbs
which
most
clearly
confirms
our
contention
if
thou
criest
after
knowledge
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding
then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
find
the
knowledge
of
god
for
the
lord
giveth
wisdom
out
of
his
mouth
cometh
knowledge
and
understanding
these
words
clearly
enunciate
that
wisdom
or
intellect
alone
teaches
us
to
fear
god
wisely
that
is
to
worship
him
truly
that
wisdom
and
knowledge
flow
from
god
mouth
and
that
god
bestows
on
us
this
gift
this
we
have
already
shown
in
proving
that
our
understanding
and
our
knowledge
depend
on
spring
from
and
are
perfected
by
the
idea
or
knowledge
of
god
and
nothing
else
solomon
goes
on
to
say
in
so
many
words
that
this
knowledge
contains
and
involves
the
true
principles
of
ethics
and
politics
when
wisdom
entereth
into
thy
heart
and
knowledge
is
pleasant
to
thy
soul
discretion
shall
preserve
thee
understanding
shall
keep
thee
then
shalt
thou
understand
righteousness
and
judgment
and
equity
yea
every
good
path
all
of
which
is
in
obvious
agreement
with
natural
knowledge
for
after
we
have
come
to
the
understanding
of
things
and
have
tasted
the
excellence
of
knowledge
she
teaches
us
ethics
and
true
virtue
thus
the
happiness
and
the
peace
of
him
who
cultivates
his
natural
understanding
lies
according
to
solomon
also
not
so
much
under
the
dominion
of
fortune
or
god
external
aid
as
in
inward
personal
virtue
or
god
internal
aid
for
the
latter
can
to
a
great
extent
be
preserved
by
vigilance
right
action
and
thought
lastly
we
must
by
no
means
pass
over
the
passage
in
paul
epistle
to
the
romans
in
which
he
says
for
the
invisible
things
of
god
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
so
that
they
are
without
excuse
because
when
they
knew
god
they
glorified
him
not
as
god
neither
were
they
thankful
these
words
clearly
show
that
everyone
can
by
the
light
of
nature
clearly
understand
the
goodness
and
the
eternal
divinity
of
god
and
can
thence
know
and
deduce
what
they
should
seek
for
and
what
avoid
wherefore
the
apostle
says
that
they
are
without
excuse
and
can
not
plead
ignorance
as
they
certainly
might
if
it
were
a
question
of
supernatural
light
and
the
incarnation
passion
and
resurrection
of
christ
wherefore
he
goes
on
to
say
ib
god
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
hearts
and
so
on
through
the
rest
of
the
chapter
he
describes
the
vices
of
ignorance
and
sets
them
forth
as
the
punishment
of
ignorance
this
obviously
agrees
with
the
verse
of
solomon
already
quoted
the
instruction
of
fools
is
folly
so
that
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
paul
says
that
the
wicked
are
without
excuse
as
every
man
sows
so
shall
he
reap
out
of
evil
evils
necessarily
spring
unless
they
be
wisely
counteracted
thus
we
see
that
scripture
literally
approves
of
the
light
of
natural
reason
and
the
natural
divine
law
and
i
have
fulfilled
the
promises
made
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
chapter
of
the
ceremonial
law
in
the
foregoing
chapter
we
have
shown
that
the
divine
law
which
renders
men
truly
blessed
and
teaches
them
the
true
life
is
universal
to
all
men
nay
we
have
so
intimately
deduced
it
from
human
nature
that
it
must
be
esteemed
innate
and
as
it
were
ingrained
in
the
human
mind
but
with
regard
to
the
ceremonial
observances
which
were
ordained
in
the
old
testament
for
the
hebrews
only
and
were
so
adapted
to
their
state
that
they
could
for
the
most
part
only
be
observed
by
the
society
as
a
whole
and
not
by
each
individual
it
is
evident
that
they
formed
no
part
of
the
divine
law
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
blessedness
and
virtue
but
had
reference
only
to
the
election
of
the
hebrews
that
is
as
i
have
shown
in
chap
ii
to
their
temporal
bodily
happiness
and
the
tranquillity
of
their
kingdom
and
that
therefore
they
were
only
valid
while
that
kingdom
lasted
if
in
the
old
testament
they
are
spoken
of
as
the
law
of
god
it
is
only
because
they
were
founded
on
revelation
or
a
basis
of
revelation
still
as
reason
however
sound
has
little
weight
with
ordinary
theologians
i
will
adduce
the
authority
of
scripture
for
what
i
here
assert
and
will
further
show
for
the
sake
of
greater
clearness
why
and
how
these
ceremonials
served
to
establish
and
preserve
the
jewish
kingdom
isaiah
teaches
most
plainly
that
the
divine
law
in
its
strict
sense
signifies
that
universal
law
which
consists
in
a
true
manner
of
life
and
does
not
signify
ceremonial
observances
in
chapter
the
prophet
calls
on
his
countrymen
to
hearken
to
the
divine
law
as
he
delivers
it
and
first
excluding
all
kinds
of
sacrifices
and
all
feasts
he
at
length
sums
up
the
law
in
these
few
words
cease
to
do
evil
learn
to
do
well
seek
judgment
relieve
the
oppressed
not
less
striking
testimony
is
given
in
psalm
where
the
psalmist
addresses
god
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
didst
not
desire
mine
ears
hast
thou
opened
burnt
offering
and
hast
thou
not
required
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
my
god
yea
thy
law
is
within
my
heart
here
the
psalmist
reckons
as
the
law
of
god
only
that
which
is
inscribed
in
his
heart
and
excludes
ceremonies
therefrom
for
the
latter
are
good
and
inscribed
on
the
heart
only
from
the
fact
of
their
institution
and
not
because
of
their
intrinsic
value
other
passages
of
scripture
testify
to
the
same
truth
but
these
two
will
suffice
we
may
also
learn
from
the
bible
that
ceremonies
are
no
aid
to
blessedness
but
only
have
reference
to
the
temporal
prosperity
of
the
kingdom
for
the
rewards
promised
for
their
observance
are
merely
temporal
advantages
and
delights
blessedness
being
reserved
for
the
universal
divine
law
in
all
the
five
books
commonly
attributed
to
moses
nothing
is
promised
as
i
have
said
beyond
temporal
benefits
such
as
honours
fame
victories
riches
enjoyments
and
health
though
many
moral
precepts
besides
ceremonies
are
contained
in
these
five
books
they
appear
not
as
moral
doctrines
universal
to
all
men
but
as
commands
especially
adapted
to
the
understanding
and
character
of
the
hebrew
people
and
as
having
reference
only
to
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
for
instance
moses
does
not
teach
the
jews
as
a
prophet
not
to
kill
or
to
steal
but
gives
these
commandments
solely
as
a
lawgiver
and
judge
he
does
not
reason
out
the
doctrine
but
affixes
for
its
a
penalty
which
may
and
very
properly
does
vary
in
different
nations
so
too
the
command
not
to
commit
adultery
is
given
merely
with
reference
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
for
if
the
moral
doctrine
had
been
intended
with
reference
not
only
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
but
also
to
the
tranquillity
and
blessedness
of
the
individual
moses
would
have
condemned
not
merely
the
outward
act
but
also
the
mental
acquiescence
as
is
done
by
christ
who
taught
only
universal
moral
precepts
and
for
this
cause
promises
a
spiritual
instead
of
a
temporal
reward
christ
as
i
have
said
was
sent
into
the
world
not
to
preserve
the
state
nor
to
lay
down
laws
but
solely
to
teach
the
universal
moral
law
so
we
can
easily
understand
that
he
wished
in
nowise
to
do
away
with
the
law
of
moses
inasmuch
as
he
introduced
no
new
laws
of
his
own
his
sole
care
was
to
teach
moral
doctrines
and
distinguish
them
from
the
laws
of
the
state
for
the
pharisees
in
their
ignorance
thought
that
the
observance
of
the
state
law
and
the
mosaic
law
was
the
sum
total
of
morality
whereas
such
laws
merely
had
reference
to
the
public
welfare
and
aimed
not
so
much
at
instructing
the
jews
as
at
keeping
them
under
constraint
but
let
us
return
to
our
subject
and
cite
other
passages
of
scripture
which
set
forth
temporal
benefits
as
rewards
for
observing
the
ceremonial
law
and
blessedness
as
reward
for
the
universal
law
none
of
the
prophets
puts
the
point
more
clearly
than
isaiah
after
condemning
hypocrisy
he
commends
liberty
and
charity
towards
self
and
one
neighbours
and
promises
as
a
reward
then
shall
thy
light
break
forth
as
the
morning
and
thy
health
shall
spring
forth
speedily
thy
righteousness
shall
go
before
thee
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
thy
reward
chap
shortly
afterwards
he
commends
the
sabbath
and
for
a
due
observance
of
it
promises
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
ride
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
and
feed
thee
with
the
heritage
of
jacob
thy
father
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
has
spoken
it
thus
the
prophet
for
liberty
bestowed
and
charitable
works
promises
a
healthy
mind
in
a
healthy
body
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
even
after
death
whereas
for
ceremonial
exactitude
he
only
promises
security
of
rule
prosperity
and
temporal
happiness
in
psalms
xv
and
xxiv
no
mention
is
made
of
ceremonies
but
only
of
moral
doctrines
inasmuch
as
there
is
no
question
of
anything
but
blessedness
and
blessedness
is
symbolically
promised
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
expressions
the
hill
of
god
and
his
tents
and
the
dwellers
therein
refer
to
blessedness
and
security
of
soul
not
to
the
actual
mount
of
jerusalem
and
the
tabernacle
of
moses
for
these
latter
were
not
dwelt
in
by
anyone
and
only
the
sons
of
levi
ministered
there
further
all
those
sentences
of
solomon
to
which
i
referred
in
the
last
chapter
for
the
cultivation
of
the
intellect
and
wisdom
promise
true
blessedness
for
by
wisdom
is
the
fear
of
god
at
length
understood
and
the
knowledge
of
god
found
that
the
jews
themselves
were
not
bound
to
practise
their
ceremonial
observances
after
the
destruction
of
their
kingdom
is
evident
from
jeremiah
for
when
the
prophet
saw
and
foretold
that
the
desolation
of
the
city
was
at
hand
he
said
that
god
only
delights
in
those
who
know
and
understand
that
he
exercises
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
earth
and
that
such
persons
only
are
worthy
of
praise
jer
as
though
god
had
said
that
after
the
desolation
of
the
city
he
would
require
nothing
special
from
the
jews
beyond
the
natural
law
by
which
all
men
are
bound
the
new
testament
also
confirms
this
view
for
only
moral
doctrines
are
therein
taught
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
promised
as
a
reward
whereas
ceremonial
observances
are
not
touched
on
by
the
apostles
after
they
began
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
the
pharisees
certainly
continued
to
practise
these
rites
after
the
destruction
of
the
kingdom
but
more
with
a
view
of
opposing
the
christians
than
of
pleasing
god
for
after
the
first
destruction
of
the
city
when
they
were
led
captive
to
babylon
not
being
then
so
far
as
i
am
aware
split
up
into
sects
they
straightway
neglected
their
rites
bid
farewell
to
the
mosaic
law
buried
their
national
customs
in
oblivion
as
being
plainly
superfluous
and
began
to
mingle
with
other
nations
as
we
may
abundantly
learn
from
ezra
and
nehemiah
we
can
not
therefore
doubt
that
they
were
no
more
bound
by
the
law
of
moses
after
the
destruction
of
their
kingdom
than
they
had
been
before
it
had
been
begun
while
they
were
still
living
among
other
peoples
before
the
exodus
from
egypt
and
were
subject
to
no
special
law
beyond
the
natural
law
and
also
doubtless
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
living
in
so
far
as
it
was
consonant
with
the
divine
natural
law
as
to
the
fact
that
the
patriarchs
offered
sacrifices
i
think
they
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
their
piety
for
their
minds
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
to
the
idea
of
sacrifice
which
we
know
had
been
universal
from
the
time
of
enoch
and
thus
they
found
in
sacrifice
their
most
powerful
incentive
the
patriarchs
then
did
not
sacrifice
to
god
at
the
bidding
of
a
divine
right
or
as
taught
by
the
basis
of
the
divine
law
but
simply
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
time
and
if
in
so
doing
they
followed
any
ordinance
it
was
simply
the
ordinance
of
the
country
they
were
living
in
by
which
as
we
have
seen
before
in
the
case
of
melchisedek
they
were
bound
i
think
that
i
have
now
given
scriptural
authority
for
my
view
it
remains
to
show
why
and
how
the
ceremonial
observances
tended
to
preserve
and
confirm
the
hebrew
kingdom
and
this
i
can
very
briefly
do
on
grounds
universally
accepted
the
formation
of
society
serves
not
only
for
defensive
purposes
but
is
also
very
useful
and
indeed
absolutely
necessary
as
rendering
possible
the
division
of
labour
if
men
did
not
render
mutual
assistance
to
each
other
no
one
would
have
either
the
skill
or
the
time
to
provide
for
his
own
sustenance
and
preservation
for
all
men
are
not
equally
apt
for
all
work
and
no
one
would
be
capable
of
preparing
all
that
he
individually
stood
in
need
of
strength
and
time
i
repeat
would
fail
if
every
one
had
in
person
to
plough
to
sow
to
reap
to
grind
corn
to
cook
to
weave
to
stitch
and
perform
the
other
numerous
functions
required
to
keep
life
going
to
say
nothing
of
the
arts
and
sciences
which
are
also
entirely
necessary
to
the
perfection
and
blessedness
of
human
nature
we
see
that
peoples
living
in
uncivilized
barbarism
lead
a
wretched
and
almost
animal
life
and
even
they
would
not
be
able
to
acquire
their
few
rude
necessaries
without
assisting
one
another
to
a
certain
extent
now
if
men
were
so
constituted
by
nature
that
they
desired
nothing
but
what
is
designated
by
true
reason
society
would
obviously
have
no
need
of
laws
it
would
be
sufficient
to
inculcate
true
moral
doctrines
and
men
would
freely
without
hesitation
act
in
accordance
with
their
true
interests
but
human
nature
is
framed
in
a
different
fashion
every
one
indeed
seeks
his
own
interest
but
does
not
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
sound
reason
for
most
men
ideas
of
desirability
and
usefulness
are
guided
by
their
fleshly
instincts
and
emotions
which
take
no
thought
beyond
the
present
and
the
immediate
object
therefore
no
society
can
exist
without
government
and
force
and
laws
to
restrain
and
repress
men
desires
and
immoderate
impulses
still
human
nature
will
not
submit
to
absolute
repression
violent
governments
as
seneca
says
never
last
long
the
moderate
governments
endure
so
long
as
men
act
simply
from
fear
they
act
contrary
to
their
inclinations
taking
no
thought
for
the
advantages
or
necessity
of
their
actions
but
simply
endeavouring
to
escape
punishment
or
loss
of
life
they
must
needs
rejoice
in
any
evil
which
befalls
their
ruler
even
if
it
should
involve
themselves
and
must
long
for
and
bring
about
such
evil
by
every
means
in
their
power
again
men
are
especially
intolerant
of
serving
and
being
ruled
by
their
equals
lastly
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
revoke
liberties
once
granted
from
these
considerations
it
follows
firstly
that
authority
should
either
be
vested
in
the
hands
of
the
whole
state
in
common
so
that
everyone
should
be
bound
to
serve
and
yet
not
be
in
subjection
to
his
equals
or
else
if
power
be
in
the
hands
of
a
few
or
one
man
that
one
man
should
be
something
above
average
humanity
or
should
strive
to
get
himself
accepted
as
such
secondly
laws
should
in
every
government
be
so
arranged
that
people
should
be
kept
in
bounds
by
the
hope
of
some
greatly
desired
good
rather
than
by
fear
for
then
everyone
will
do
his
duty
willingly
lastly
as
obedience
consists
in
acting
at
the
bidding
of
external
authority
it
would
have
no
place
in
a
state
where
the
government
is
vested
in
the
whole
people
and
where
laws
are
made
by
common
consent
in
such
a
society
the
people
would
remain
free
whether
the
laws
were
added
to
or
diminished
inasmuch
as
it
would
not
be
done
on
external
authority
but
their
own
free
consent
the
reverse
happens
when
the
sovereign
power
is
vested
in
one
man
for
all
act
at
his
bidding
and
therefore
unless
they
had
been
trained
from
the
first
to
depend
on
the
words
of
their
ruler
the
latter
would
find
it
difficult
in
case
of
need
to
abrogate
liberties
once
conceded
and
impose
new
laws
from
these
universal
considerations
let
us
pass
on
to
the
kingdom
of
the
jews
the
jews
when
they
first
came
out
of
egypt
were
not
bound
by
any
national
laws
and
were
therefore
free
to
ratify
any
laws
they
liked
or
to
make
new
ones
and
were
at
liberty
to
set
up
a
government
and
occupy
a
territory
wherever
they
chose
however
they
were
entirely
unfit
to
frame
a
wise
code
of
laws
and
to
keep
the
sovereign
power
vested
in
the
community
they
were
all
uncultivated
and
sunk
in
a
wretched
slavery
therefore
the
sovereignty
was
bound
to
remain
vested
in
the
hands
of
one
man
who
would
rule
the
rest
and
keep
them
under
constraint
make
laws
and
interpret
them
this
sovereignty
was
easily
retained
by
moses
because
he
surpassed
the
rest
in
virtue
and
persuaded
the
people
of
the
fact
proving
it
by
many
testimonies
see
exod
chap
last
verse
and
chap
he
then
by
the
divine
virtue
he
possessed
made
laws
and
ordained
them
for
the
people
taking
the
greatest
care
that
they
should
be
obeyed
willingly
and
not
through
fear
being
specially
induced
to
adopt
this
course
by
the
obstinate
nature
of
the
jews
who
would
not
have
submitted
to
be
ruled
solely
by
constraint
and
also
by
the
imminence
of
war
for
it
is
always
better
to
inspire
soldiers
with
a
thirst
for
glory
than
to
terrify
them
with
threats
each
man
will
then
strive
to
distinguish
himself
by
valour
and
courage
instead
of
merely
trying
to
escape
punishment
moses
therefore
by
his
virtue
and
the
divine
command
introduced
a
religion
so
that
the
people
might
do
their
duty
from
devotion
rather
than
fear
further
he
bound
them
over
by
benefits
and
prophesied
many
advantages
in
the
future
nor
were
his
laws
very
severe
as
anyone
may
see
for
himself
especially
if
he
remarks
the
number
of
circumstances
necessary
in
order
to
procure
the
conviction
of
an
accused
person
lastly
in
order
that
the
people
which
could
not
govern
itself
should
be
entirely
dependent
on
its
ruler
he
left
nothing
to
the
free
choice
of
individuals
who
had
hitherto
been
slaves
the
people
could
do
nothing
but
remember
the
law
and
follow
the
ordinances
laid
down
at
the
good
pleasure
of
their
ruler
they
were
not
allowed
to
plough
to
sow
to
reap
nor
even
to
eat
to
clothe
themselves
to
shave
to
rejoice
or
in
fact
to
do
anything
whatever
as
they
liked
but
were
bound
to
follow
the
directions
given
in
the
law
and
not
only
this
but
they
were
obliged
to
have
marks
on
their
on
their
hands
and
between
their
eyes
to
admonish
them
to
perpetual
obedience
this
then
was
the
object
of
the
ceremonial
law
that
men
should
do
nothing
of
their
own
free
will
but
should
always
act
under
external
authority
and
should
continually
confess
by
their
actions
and
thoughts
that
they
were
not
their
own
masters
but
were
entirely
under
the
control
of
others
from
all
these
considerations
it
is
clearer
than
day
that
ceremonies
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
state
of
blessedness
and
that
those
mentioned
in
the
old
testament
the
whole
mosaic
law
had
reference
merely
to
the
government
of
the
jews
and
merely
temporal
advantages
as
for
the
christian
rites
such
as
baptism
the
lord
supper
festivals
public
prayers
and
any
other
observances
which
are
and
always
have
been
common
to
all
christendom
if
they
were
instituted
by
christ
or
his
apostles
which
is
open
to
doubt
they
were
instituted
as
external
signs
of
the
universal
church
and
not
as
having
anything
to
do
with
blessedness
or
possessing
any
sanctity
in
themselves
therefore
though
such
ceremonies
were
not
ordained
for
the
sake
of
upholding
a
government
they
were
ordained
for
the
preservation
of
a
society
and
accordingly
he
who
lives
alone
is
not
bound
by
them
nay
those
who
live
in
a
country
where
the
christian
religion
is
forbidden
are
bound
to
abstain
from
such
rites
and
can
none
the
less
live
in
a
state
of
blessedness
we
have
an
example
of
this
in
japan
where
the
christian
religion
is
forbidden
and
the
dutch
who
live
there
are
enjoined
by
their
east
india
company
not
to
practise
any
outward
rites
of
religion
i
need
not
cite
other
examples
though
it
would
be
easy
to
prove
my
point
from
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
new
testament
and
to
adduce
many
confirmatory
instances
but
i
pass
on
the
more
willingly
as
i
am
anxious
to
proceed
to
my
next
proposition
i
will
now
therefore
pass
on
to
what
i
proposed
to
treat
of
in
the
second
part
of
this
chapter
namely
what
persons
are
bound
to
believe
in
the
narratives
contained
in
scripture
and
how
far
they
are
so
bound
examining
this
question
by
the
aid
of
natural
reason
i
will
proceed
as
follows
if
anyone
wishes
to
persuade
his
fellows
for
or
against
anything
which
is
not
he
must
deduce
his
contention
from
their
admissions
and
convince
them
either
by
experience
or
by
ratiocination
either
by
appealing
to
facts
of
natural
experience
or
to
intellectual
axioms
now
unless
the
experience
be
of
such
a
kind
as
to
be
clearly
and
distinctly
understood
though
it
may
convince
a
man
it
will
not
have
the
same
effect
on
his
mind
and
disperse
the
clouds
of
his
doubt
so
completely
as
when
the
doctrine
taught
is
deduced
entirely
from
intellectual
axioms
that
is
by
the
mere
power
of
the
understanding
and
logical
order
and
this
is
especially
the
case
in
spiritual
matters
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
senses
but
the
deduction
of
conclusions
from
general
truths
a
priori
usually
requires
a
long
chain
of
arguments
and
moreover
very
great
caution
acuteness
and
qualities
which
are
not
often
met
with
therefore
people
prefer
to
be
taught
by
experience
rather
than
deduce
their
conclusion
from
a
few
axioms
and
set
them
out
in
logical
order
whence
it
follows
that
if
anyone
wishes
to
teach
a
doctrine
to
a
whole
nation
not
to
speak
of
the
whole
human
race
and
to
be
understood
by
all
men
in
every
particular
he
will
seek
to
support
his
teaching
with
experience
and
will
endeavour
to
suit
his
reasonings
and
the
definitions
of
his
doctrines
as
far
as
possible
to
the
understanding
of
the
common
people
who
form
the
majority
of
mankind
and
he
will
not
set
them
forth
in
logical
sequence
nor
adduce
the
definitions
which
serve
to
establish
them
otherwise
he
writes
only
for
the
learned
that
is
he
will
be
understood
by
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
human
race
all
scripture
was
written
primarily
for
an
entire
people
and
secondarily
for
the
whole
human
race
therefore
its
contents
must
necessarily
be
adapted
as
far
as
possible
to
the
understanding
of
the
masses
and
proved
only
by
examples
drawn
from
experience
we
will
explain
ourselves
more
clearly
the
chief
speculative
doctrines
taught
in
scripture
are
the
existence
of
god
or
a
being
who
made
all
things
and
who
directs
and
sustains
the
world
with
consummate
wisdom
furthermore
that
god
takes
the
greatest
thought
for
men
or
such
of
them
as
live
piously
and
honourably
while
he
punishes
with
various
penalties
those
who
do
evil
separating
them
from
the
good
all
this
is
proved
in
scripture
entirely
through
is
through
the
narratives
there
related
no
definitions
of
doctrine
are
given
but
all
the
sayings
and
reasonings
are
adapted
to
the
understanding
of
the
masses
although
experience
can
give
no
clear
knowledge
of
these
things
nor
explain
the
nature
of
god
nor
how
he
directs
and
sustains
all
things
it
can
nevertheless
teach
and
enlighten
men
sufficiently
to
impress
obedience
and
devotion
on
their
minds
it
is
now
i
think
sufficiently
clear
what
persons
are
bound
to
believe
in
the
scripture
narratives
and
in
what
degree
they
are
so
bound
for
it
evidently
follows
from
what
has
been
said
that
the
knowledge
of
and
belief
in
them
is
particularly
necessary
to
the
masses
whose
intellect
is
not
capable
of
perceiving
things
clearly
and
distinctly
further
he
who
denies
them
because
he
does
not
believe
that
god
exists
or
takes
thought
for
men
and
the
world
may
be
accounted
impious
but
a
man
who
is
ignorant
of
them
and
nevertheless
knows
by
natural
reason
that
god
exists
as
we
have
said
and
has
a
true
plan
of
life
is
altogether
blessed
yes
more
blessed
than
the
common
herd
of
believers
because
besides
true
opinions
he
possesses
also
a
true
and
distinct
conception
lastly
he
who
is
ignorant
of
the
scriptures
and
knows
nothing
by
the
light
of
reason
though
he
may
not
be
impious
or
rebellious
is
yet
less
than
human
and
almost
brutal
having
none
of
god
gifts
we
must
here
remark
that
when
we
say
that
the
knowledge
of
the
sacred
narrative
is
particularly
necessary
to
the
masses
we
do
not
mean
the
knowledge
of
absolutely
all
the
narratives
in
the
bible
but
only
of
the
principal
ones
those
which
taken
by
themselves
plainly
display
the
doctrine
we
have
just
stated
and
have
most
effect
over
men
minds
if
all
the
narratives
in
scripture
were
necessary
for
the
proof
of
this
doctrine
and
if
no
conclusion
could
be
drawn
without
the
general
consideration
of
every
one
of
the
histories
contained
in
the
sacred
writings
truly
the
conclusion
and
demonstration
of
such
doctrine
would
overtask
the
understanding
and
strength
not
only
of
the
masses
but
of
humanity
who
is
there
who
could
give
attention
to
all
the
narratives
at
once
and
to
all
the
circumstances
and
all
the
scraps
of
doctrine
to
be
elicited
from
such
a
host
of
diverse
histories
i
can
not
believe
that
the
men
who
have
left
us
the
bible
as
we
have
it
were
so
abounding
in
talent
that
they
attempted
setting
about
such
a
method
of
demonstration
still
less
can
i
suppose
that
we
can
not
understand
scriptural
doctrine
till
we
have
given
heed
to
the
quarrels
of
isaac
the
advice
of
achitophel
to
absalom
the
civil
war
between
jews
and
israelites
and
other
similar
chronicles
nor
can
i
think
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
teach
such
doctrine
by
means
of
history
to
the
jews
of
early
times
the
contemporaries
of
moses
than
it
was
to
the
contemporaries
of
esdras
but
more
will
be
said
on
this
point
hereafter
we
may
now
only
note
that
the
masses
are
only
bound
to
know
those
histories
which
can
most
powerfully
dispose
their
mind
to
obedience
and
devotion
however
the
masses
are
not
sufficiently
skilled
to
draw
conclusions
from
what
they
read
they
take
more
delight
in
the
actual
stories
and
in
the
strange
and
issues
of
events
than
in
the
doctrines
implied
therefore
besides
reading
these
narratives
they
are
always
in
need
of
pastors
or
church
ministers
to
explain
them
to
their
feeble
intelligence
but
not
to
wander
from
our
point
let
us
conclude
with
what
has
been
our
principal
object
namely
that
the
truth
of
narratives
be
they
what
they
may
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
divine
law
and
serves
for
nothing
except
in
respect
of
doctrine
the
sole
element
which
makes
one
history
better
than
another
the
narratives
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
surpass
profane
history
and
differ
among
themselves
in
merit
simply
by
reason
of
the
salutary
doctrines
which
they
inculcate
therefore
if
a
man
were
to
read
the
scripture
narratives
believing
the
whole
of
them
but
were
to
give
no
heed
to
the
doctrines
they
contain
and
make
no
amendment
in
his
life
he
might
employ
himself
just
as
profitably
in
reading
the
koran
or
the
poetic
drama
or
ordinary
chronicles
with
the
attention
usually
given
to
such
writings
on
the
other
hand
if
a
man
is
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
scriptures
and
none
the
less
has
right
opinions
and
a
true
plan
of
life
he
is
absolutely
blessed
and
truly
possesses
in
himself
the
spirit
of
christ
the
jews
are
of
a
directly
contrary
way
of
thinking
for
they
hold
that
true
opinions
and
a
true
plan
of
life
are
of
no
service
in
attaining
blessedness
if
their
possessors
have
arrived
at
them
by
the
light
of
reason
only
and
not
like
the
documents
prophetically
revealed
to
moses
maimonides
ventures
openly
to
make
this
assertion
every
man
who
takes
to
heart
the
seven
precepts
and
diligently
follows
them
is
counted
with
the
pious
among
the
nation
and
an
heir
of
the
world
to
come
that
is
to
say
if
he
takes
to
heart
and
follows
them
because
god
ordained
them
in
the
law
and
revealed
them
to
us
by
moses
because
they
were
of
aforetime
precepts
to
the
sons
of
noah
but
he
who
follows
them
as
led
thereto
by
reason
is
not
counted
as
a
dweller
among
the
pious
or
among
the
wise
of
the
nations
such
are
the
words
of
maimonides
to
which
joseph
the
son
of
shem
job
adds
in
his
book
which
he
calls
kebod
elohim
or
god
glory
that
although
aristotle
whom
he
considers
to
have
written
the
best
ethics
and
to
be
above
everyone
else
has
not
omitted
anything
that
concerns
true
ethics
and
which
he
has
adopted
in
his
own
book
carefully
following
the
lines
laid
down
yet
this
was
not
able
to
suffice
for
his
salvation
inasmuch
as
he
embraced
his
doctrines
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
reason
and
not
as
divine
documents
prophetically
revealed
however
that
these
are
mere
figments
and
are
not
supported
by
scriptural
authority
will
i
think
be
sufficiently
evident
to
the
attentive
reader
so
that
an
examination
of
the
theory
will
be
sufficient
for
its
refutation
it
is
not
my
purpose
here
to
refute
the
assertions
of
those
who
assert
that
the
natural
light
of
reason
can
teach
nothing
of
any
value
concerning
the
true
way
of
salvation
people
who
lay
no
claims
to
reason
for
themselves
are
not
able
to
prove
by
reason
this
their
assertion
and
if
they
hawk
about
something
superior
to
reason
it
is
a
mere
figment
and
far
below
reason
as
their
general
method
of
life
sufficiently
shows
but
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
upon
such
persons
i
will
merely
add
that
we
can
only
judge
of
a
man
by
his
works
if
a
man
abounds
in
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
charity
joy
peace
kindness
goodness
faith
gentleness
chastity
against
which
as
paul
says
gal
there
is
no
law
such
an
one
whether
he
be
taught
by
reason
only
or
by
the
scripture
only
has
been
in
very
truth
taught
by
god
and
is
altogether
blessed
thus
have
i
said
all
that
i
undertook
to
say
concerning
divine
law
end
of
part
author
endnotes
to
the
treatise

i
to

endnote
the

rightly
interpreted
by
rabbi
salomon
jarchi
but
the
sense
is
hardly
caught
by
aben
ezra
who
was
not
so
good
a
hebraist
we
must
also
remark
that
this

word

has
a
universal
meaning
and
embraces
all
kinds
of

other

of

knowledge
is
divine
its
professors
can
not
be
called
prophets
that
is
interpreters
of
god
for
he
alone
is
an
interpreter
of
god
who
interprets
the
decrees
which
god
has
revealed
to
him
to
others
who
have
not
received
such
revelation
and
whose
belief
therefore
rests
merely
on
the
prophet
authority
and
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
if
it
were
otherwise
and
all
who
listen
to
prophets
became
prophets
themselves
as
all
who
listen
to
philosophers
become
philosophers
a
prophet
would
no
longer
be
the
interpreter
of
divine
decrees
inasmuch
as
his
hearers
would
know
the
truth
not
on
the
authority
of
the
prophet
but
by
means
of
actual
divine
revelation
and
inward
testimony
thus
the
sovereign
powers
are
the
interpreters
of
their
own
rights
of
sway
because
these
are
defended
only
by
their
authority
and
supported
by
their
testimony
endnote
prophets
were
endowed
with
a
peculiar
and
extraordinary
power
though
some
men
enjoy
gifts
which
nature
has
not
bestowed
on
their
fellows
they
are
not
said
to
surpass
the
bounds
of
human
nature
unless
their
special
qualities
are
such
as
can
not
be
said
to
be
deducible
from
the
definition
of
human
nature
for
instance
a
giant
is
a
rarity
but
still
human
the
gift
of
composing
poetry
extempore
is
given
to
very
few
yet
it
is
human
the
same
may
therefore
be
said
of
the
faculty
possessed
by
some
of
imagining
things
as
vividly
as
though
they
saw
them
before
them
and
this
not
while
asleep
but
while
awake
but
if
anyone
could
be
found
who
possessed
other
means
and
other
foundations
for
knowledge
he
might
be
said
to
transcend
the
limits
of
human
nature

that

abraham

rewards
abraham
answered
that
