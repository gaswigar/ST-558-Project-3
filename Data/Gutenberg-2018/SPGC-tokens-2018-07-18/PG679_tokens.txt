appeal
to

my
mother
kiss
my
mother
kiss
my
mother
kiss
i
feel
its
impress
now
as
in
the
bright
and
happy
days
she
pressed
it
on
my
brow
you
say
it
is
a
fancied
thing
within
my
memory
fraught
to
me
it
has
a
sacred
place
the
treasure
house
of
thought
again
i
feel
her
fingers
glide
amid
my
clustering
hair
i
see
the
in
her
eyes
when
all
my
life
was
fair
again
i
hear
her
gentle
voice
in
warning
or
in
love
how
precious
was
the
faith
that
taught
my
soul
of
things
above
my
mother
kiss
the
music
of
her
voice
is
stilled
her
lips
are
paled
in
death
as
precious
pearls
i
clasp
her
words
until
my
latest
breath
the
world
has
scattered
round
my
path
honor
and
wealth
and
fame
but
naught
so
precious
as
the
thoughts
that
gather
round
her
name
and
friends
have
placed
upon
my
brow
the
laurels
of
renown
but
she
first
taught
me
how
to
wear
my
manhood
as
a
crown
my
hair
is
silvered
with
age
i
longing
to
depart
to
clasp
again
my
mother
hand
and
be
a
child
at
heart
to
roam
with
her
the
where
saints
and
angels
greet
to
cast
our
crowns
with
songs
of
love
at
our
redeemer
feet
a
grain
of
sand
a
grain
of
sand
do
you
see
this
grain
of
sand
lying
loosely
in
my
hand
do
you
know
to
me
it
brought
just
a
simple
loving
thought
when
one
gazes
night
by
night
on
the
glorious
stars
of
light
oh
how
little
seems
the
span
measured
round
the
life
of
man
oh
how
fleeting
are
his
years
with
their
smiles
and
their
tears
can
it
be
that
god
does
care
for
such
atoms
as
we
are
then
outspake
this
grain
of
sand
i
was
fashioned
by
his
hand
in
the
star
lit
realms
of
space
i
was
made
to
have
a
place
should
the
ocean
flood
the
world
were
its
mountains
me
hurled
all
the
force
they
could
employ
would
a
single
grain
destroy
and
if
i
a
thing
so
light
have
a
place
within
his
sight
you
are
linked
unto
his
throne
can
not
live
nor
die
alone
the
crocuses
in
the
everlasting
arms
mid
life
dangers
and
alarms
let
calm
trust
your
spirit
fill
know
he
god
and
then
be
still
trustingly
i
raised
my
head
hearing
what
the
atom
said
knowing
man
is
greater
far
than
the
brightest
sun
or
star
the
crocuses
they
heard
the
south
wind
sighing
a
murmur
of
the
rain
and
they
knew
that
earth
was
longing
to
see
them
all
again
while
the
still
were
sleeping
beneath
the
silent
sod
they
felt
their
new
life
pulsing
within
the
dark
cold
clod
not
a
daffodil
nor
daisy
had
dared
to
raise
its
head
not
a
fairhaired
dandelion
peeped
timid
from
its
bed
the
crocuses
though
a
tremor
of
the
winter
did
shivering
through
them
run
yet
they
lifted
up
their
foreheads
to
greet
the
vernal
sun
and
the
sunbeams
gave
them
welcome
as
did
the
morning
air
and
scattered
their
simple
robes
rich
tints
of
beauty
rare
soon
a
host
of
lovely
flowers
from
vales
and
woodland
burst
but
in
all
that
fair
procession
the
crocuses
were
first
first
to
weave
for
earth
a
chaplet
to
crown
her
dear
old
head
and
to
beautify
the
pathway
where
winter
still
did
tread
and
their
loved
and
white
haired
mother
smiled
sweetly
the
touch
when
she
knew
her
faithful
children
were
loving
her
so
much
the
present
age
the
present
age

not
the
age

hard

on
the
reception
of
the
annex
to
the
home
for
aged
colored
people
from
the
bequest
of
edward
parker
outcast
from
her
home
in
syria
in
the
lonely
dreary
wild
heavy
hearted
sorrow
stricken
sat
a
mother
and
her
child
dedication
poem
there
was
not
a
voice
to
cheer
her
not
a
soul
to
share
her
fate
she
was
weary
he
was
fainting
and
life
seemed
so
desolate
far
away
in
sunny
egypt
was
lone
hagar
native
land
where
the
nile
in
kingly
bounty
scatters
bread
with
gracious
hand
in
the
tents
of
princely
abram
she
for
years
had
found
a
home
till
the
stern
decree
of
sarah
sent
her
forth
the
wild
to
roam
hour
by
hour
she
journeyed
onward
from
the
shelter
of
their
tent
till
her
footsteps
slowly
faltered
and
the
water
all
was
spent
then
she
veiled
her
face
in
sorrow
feared
her
child
would
die
of
thirst
till
her
eyes
with
tears
so
holden
saw
a
sparkling
fountain
burst
oh
how
happy
was
that
mother
what
a
soothing
of
her
pain
dedication
poem
when
she
saw
her
child
reviving
life
rejoicing
through
each
vein
does
not
life
repeat
this
story
tell
it
over
day
by
day
of
the
fountains
of
refreshment
ever
springing
by
our
way
here
is
one
by
which
we
gather
on
this
bright
and
happy
day
just
to
bask
beside
a
fountain
making
gladder
life
highway
bringing
unto
hearts
now
aged
who
have
borne
life
burdens
long
such
a
gift
of
love
and
mercy
as
deserves
our
sweetest
song
such
a
gift
that
even
heaven
may
rejoice
with
us
below
if
the
pure
and
holy
angels
join
us
in
our
joy
and
woe
may
the
memory
of
the
giver
in
this
home
where
age
may
rest
float
like
fragrance
through
the
ages
ever
blessing
ever
blest
a
double
standard
when
the
gates
of
pearl
are
opened
may
we
there
this
friend
behold
drink
with
him
from
living
fountains
walk
with
him
the
streets
of
gold
when
life
shattered
cords
of
music
shall
again
be
sweetly
sung
then
our
hearts
with
life
immortal
shall
be
young
forever
young
a
double
standard
do
you
blame
me
that
i
loved
him
if
when
standing
all
alone
i
cried
for
bread
a
careless
world
pressed
to
my
lips
a
stone
do
you
blame
me
that
i
loved
him
that
my
heart
beat
glad
and
free
when
he
told
me
in
the
sweetest
tones
he
loved
but
only
me
can
you
blame
me
that
i
did
not
see
beneath
his
burning
kiss
the
serpent
wiles
nor
even
hear
the
deadly
adder
hiss
a
double
standard
can
you
blame
me
that
my
heart
grew
cold
the
tempted
tempter
turned
when
he
was
feted
and
caressed
and
i
was
coldly
spurned
would
you
blame
him
when
you
draw
from
me
your
dainty
robes
aside
if
he
with
gilded
baits
should
claim
your
fairest
as
his
bride
would
you
blame
the
world
if
it
should
press
on
him
a
civic
crown
and
see
me
struggling
in
the
depth
then
harshly
press
me
down
crime
has
no
sex
and
yet
i
wear
the
brand
of
shame
whilst
he
amid
the
gay
and
proud
still
bears
an
honored
name
can
you
blame
me
if
i
learned
to
think
your
hate
of
vice
a
sham
when
you
so
coldly
crushed
me
down
and
then
excused
the
man
would
you
blame
me
if
the
coroner
should
say
a
double
standard
a
wretched
girl
outcast
forlorn
has
thrown
her
life
away
yes
blame
me
for
my
downward
course
but
oh
remember
well
within
your
homes
you
press
the
hand
that
led
me
down
to
hell
i
glad
god
ways
are
not
our
ways
he
does
not
see
as
man
within
his
love
i
know
there
room
for
those
whom
others
ban
i
think
before
his
great
white
throne
his
throne
of
spotless
light
that
whited
sepulchres
shall
wear
the
hue
of
endless
night
that
i
who
fell
and
he
who
sinned
shall
reap
as
we
have
sown
that
each
the
burden
of
his
loss
must
bear
and
bear
alone
no
golden
weights
can
turn
the
scale
of
justice
in
his
sight
and
what
is
wrong
in
woman
life
in
man
can
not
be
right
our
hero
our
hero
onward
to
her
destination
the
stream
the
hannah
sped
when
a
cry
of
consternation
smote
and
chilled
our
hearts
with
dread
wildly
leaping
madly
sweeping
all
relentless
in
their
sway
like
a
band
of
cruel
demons
flames
were
closing
our
way
oh
the
horror
of
those
moments
flames
above
and
waves
below
oh
the
agony
of
ages
crowded
in
one
hour
of
woe
fainter
grew
our
hearts
with
anguish
in
that
hour
with
peril
rife
when
we
saw
the
pilot
flying
for
his
life
then
a
man
uprose
before
us
we
had
once
despised
his
race
but
we
saw
a
lofty
purpose
lighting
up
his
darkened
face
our
hero
while
the
flames
were
madly
roaring
with
a
courage
grand
and
high
forth
he
rushed
unto
our
rescue
strong
to
suffer
brave
to
die
helplessly
the
boat
was
drifting
death
was
staring
in
each
face
when
he
grasped
the
fallen
rudder
took
the
pilot
vacant
place
could
he
save
us
would
he
save
us
all
his
hope
of
life
give
could
he
hold
that
fated
vessel
she
reached
the
nearer
shore
all
our
hopes
and
fears
were
centered
his
strong
unfaltering
hand
if
he
failed
us
we
must
perish
perish
just
in
sight
of
land
breathlessly
we
watched
and
waited
while
the
flames
were
raging
fast
when
our
anguish
changed
to
rapture
we
were
saved
yes
saved
at
last
never
strains
of
sweetest
music
brought
to
us
more
welcome
sound
the
dying
bondman
than
the
grating
of
that
steamer
when
her
keel
had
touched
the
ground
but
our
faithful
martyr
hero
through
a
fiery
pathway
trod
till
he
laid
his
valiant
spirit
on
the
bosom
of
his
god
fame
has
never
crowned
a
hero
on
the
crimson
fields
of
strife
grander
nobler
than
that
pilot
yielding
up
for
us
his
life
the
dying
bondman
life
was
trembling
faintly
trembling
on
the
bondman
latest
breath
and
he
felt
the
chilling
pressure
of
the
cold
hard
hand
of
death
he
had
been
an
afric
chieftain
worn
his
manhood
as
a
crown
but
upon
the
field
of
battle
had
been
fiercely
stricken
down
the
dying
bondman
he
had
longed
to
gain
his
freedom
waited
watched
and
hoped
in
vain
till
his
life
was
slowly
ebbing
almost
broken
was
his
chain
by
his
bedside
stood
the
master
gazing
on
the
dying
one
knowing
by
the
dull
grey
shadows
that
life
sands
were
almost
run
master
said
the
dying
bondman
home
and
friends
i
soon
shall
see
but
before
i
reach
my
country
master
write
that
i
am
free
for
the
spirits
of
my
fathers
would
shrink
back
from
me
in
pride
if
i
told
them
at
our
greeting
i
a
slave
had
lived
and
died
give
to
me
the
precious
token
that
my
kindred
dead
may
see
master
write
it
write
it
quickly
master
write
that
i
am
free
at
his
earnest
plea
the
master
wrote
for
him
the
glad
release
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
his
wan
and
wasted
features
flitted
one
sweet
smile
of
peace
eagerly
he
grasped
the
writing
i
am
free
at
last
he
said
backward
fell
upon
the
pillow
he
was
free
among
the
dead
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
only
a
little
scrap
of
blue
preserved
with
loving
care
but
earth
has
not
a
brilliant
hue
to
me
more
bright
and
fair
strong
drink
like
a
raging
demon
laid
on
my
heart
his
hand
when
my
darling
joined
with
others
the
loyal
legion
band
but
mystic
angels
called
away
my
loved
and
precious
child
and
life
dark
and
stormy
way
swept
waves
of
anguish
wild
the
temperance
band
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
this
badge
of
the
loyal
legion
we
placed
upon
her
breast
as
she
lay
in
her
little
coffin
taking
her
last
sweet
rest
to
wear
that
badge
as
a
token
she
earnestly
did
crave
so
we
laid
it
on
her
bosom
to
wear
it
in
the
grave
where
sorrow
would
never
reach
her
nor
harsh
words
smite
her
ear
nor
her
eyes
in
death
dimmed
slumber
would
ever
shed
a
tear
what
means
this
badge
said
her
father
whom
we
had
tried
to
save
who
said
when
we
told
her
story
do
put
it
in
the
grave
we
took
the
badge
from
her
bosom
and
laid
it
on
a
chair
and
men
by
drink
deluded
knelt
by
that
badge
in
prayer
and
vowed
in
that
hour
of
sorrow
from
drink
they
would
abstain
the
sparrow
fall
and
this
little
badge
became
the
wedge
which
broke
their
galling
chain
and
lifted
the
gloomy
shadows
that
overspread
my
life
and
flooding
my
home
with
gladness
made
me
a
happy
wife
and
this
is
why
this
scrap
of
blue
is
precious
in
my
sight
it
changed
my
sad
and
gloomy
home
from
darkness
into
light
the
sparrow
fall
too
frail
to
soar
a
feeble
thing
it
fell
to
earth
with
fluttering
wing
but
god
who
watches
over
all
beheld
that
little
sparrow
fall
was
not
a
bird
with
plumage
gay
filling
the
air
with
its
morning
lay
was
not
an
eagle
bold
and
strong
borne
on
the
tempest
wing
along
the
sparrow
fall
only
a
brown
and
weesome
thing
with
drooping
head
and
listless
wing
it
could
not
drift
beyond
his
sight
who
marshals
the
splendid
stars
of
night
its
dying
chirp
fell
on
his
ears
who
tunes
the
music
of
the
spheres
who
hears
the
hungry
lion
call
and
spreads
a
table
for
us
all
its
mission
of
song
at
last
is
done
no
more
will
it
greet
the
rising
sun
that
tiny
bird
has
found
a
rest
more
calm
than
its
mother
downy
breast
oh
restless
heart
learn
thou
to
trust
in
god
so
tender
strong
and
just
in
whose
love
and
mercy
everywhere
his
humblest
children
have
a
share
if
in
love
he
numbers
hair
whether
the
strands
be
dark
or
fair
shall
we
not
learn
to
calmly
rest
like
children
on
our
father
breast

as

and
joyous

from
the
breast
of
earth
ye
came
fair
and
lovely
are
your
cheeks
with
all
aflame
in
the
dusty
streets
and
lanes
where
the
lowly
children

there
as
gentle

ye
smile
making

welcome
you
as
the
children

children
of
the
earth

we
are
slow
to
understand
all
the
richness
of
the
gifts
flowing
from
our
father
hand
the
building
were
our
vision
clearer
far
in
this
world
of
ours
would
we
not
more
thankful
be
for
the
love
that
sends
us
flowers
welcome
early
visitants
with
your
golden
hair
with
your
message
to
our
hearts
of
our
father
loving
care
the
building
build
me
a
house
said
the
master
but
not
on
the
shifting
sand
mid
the
wreck
and
roar
of
tempests
a
house
that
will
firmly
stand
i
will
bring
thee
windows
of
agates
and
gates
of
carbuncles
bright
and
thy
fairest
courts
and
portals
shall
be
filled
with
love
and
light
thou
shalt
build
with
fadeless
rubies
all
fashioned
around
the
throne
a
house
that
shall
last
forever
with
christ
as
the
cornerstone
home
sweet
home
it
shall
be
a
royal
mansion
a
fair
and
beautiful
thing
it
will
be
the
of
thy
saviour
lord
and
king
thy
house
shall
be
bound
with
pinions
to
mansions
of
rest
above
but
grace
shall
forge
all
the
fetters
with
the
links
and
cords
of
love
thou
shalt
be
free
in
this
mansion
from
sorrow
and
pain
of
heart
for
the
peace
of
god
shall
enter
and
never
again
depart
home
sweet
home
sharers
of
a
common
country
they
had
met
in
deadly
strife
men
who
should
have
been
as
brothers
madly
sought
each
other
life
in
the
silence
of
the
even
when
the
cannon
lips
were
dumb
home
sweet
home
thoughts
of
home
and
all
its
loved
ones
to
the
soldier
heart
would
come
on
the
margin
of
a
river
the
evening
dews
and
damps
could
be
heard
the
sounds
of
music
rising
from
two
hostile
camps
one
was
singing
of
its
section
down
in
dixie
dixie
land
and
the
other
of
the
banner
waved
so
long
from
strand
to
strand
in
the
land
where
dixie
ensign
floated
the
hopeful
slave
rose
the
song
that
freedom
banner
long
might
wave
from
the
fields
of
strife
and
carnage
gentle
thoughts
began
to
roam
and
a
tender
strain
of
music
rose
with
words
of
home
sweet
home
then
the
hearts
of
strong
men
melted
for
amid
our
grief
and
sin
still
remains
that
touch
of
nature
telling
us
we
all
are
kin
the
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
in
one
grand
but
gentle
chorus
floating
to
the
starry
dome
came
the
words
that
brought
them
nearer
words
that
told
of
home
sweet
home
for
awhile
all
strife
forgotten
they
were
only
brothers
then
joining
in
the
sweet
old
chorus
not
as
soldiers
but
as
men
men
whose
hearts
would
flow
together
though
apart
their
feet
might
roam
found
a
tie
they
could
not
sever
in
the
of
each
home
never
may
the
steps
of
carnage
shake
our
land
from
shore
to
shore
but
may
mother
home
and
heaven
be
our
watchwords
evermore
the
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
they
shall
see
him
in
the
crimson
flush
of
morning
early
light
in
the
drapery
of
sunset
around
the
couch
of
night
the
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
when
the
clouds
drop
down
their
fatness
in
late
and
early
rain
they
shall
see
his
glorious
footprints
on
valley
hill
and
plain
they
shall
see
him
when
the
cyclone
breathes
terror
through
the
land
they
shall
see
him
the
murmurs
of
zephyrs
soft
and
bland
they
shall
see
him
when
the
lips
of
health
breath
vigor
through
each
nerve
when
pestilence
clasps
hands
with
death
his
purposes
to
serve
they
shall
see
him
when
the
trembling
earth
is
rocking
to
and
fro
they
shall
see
him
in
the
order
the
seasons
come
and
go
they
shall
see
him
when
the
storms
of
war
sweep
wildly
through
the
land
when
peace
descends
like
gentle
dew
they
still
shall
see
his
hand
they
shall
see
him
in
the
city
of
gems
and
pearls
of
light
nowhere
to
lay
his
head
they
shall
see
him
in
his
beauty
and
walk
with
him
in
white
to
living
founts
their
feet
shall
tend
and
christ
shall
be
their
guide
beloved
of
god
their
rest
shall
be
in
safety
by
his
side
he
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
the
conies
had
their
the
wily
fox
with
stealthy
tread
a
covert
found
but
christ
the
lord
had
not
a
place
to
lay
his
head
the
eagle
had
an
eyrie
home
the
blithesome
bird
its
quiet
rest
but
not
the
humblest
spot
on
earth
was
by
the
son
of
god
possessed
princes
and
kings
had
palaces
with
grandeur
could
adorn
each
tomb
for
him
who
came
with
love
and
life
they
had
no
home
they
gave
no
room
go
work
in
my
vineyard
the
hands
whose
touch
sent
thrills
of
joy
through
nerves
unstrung
and
palsied
frame
the
feet
that
travelled
for
our
need
were
nailed
unto
the
cross
of
shame
how
dare
i
murmur
at
my
lot
or
talk
of
sorrow
pain
and
loss
when
christ
was
in
a
manger
laid
and
died
in
anguish
on
the
cross
that
homeless
one
beheld
beyond
his
lonely
agonizing
pain
a
love
outflowing
from
his
heart
that
all
the
wandering
world
would
gain
go
work
in
my
vineyard
go
work
in
my
vineyard
said
the
lord
and
gather
the
bruised
grain
but
the
reapers
had
left
the
stubble
bare
and
i
trod
the
soil
in
pain
go
work
in
my
vineyard
the
fields
of
my
lord
are
wide
and
broad
he
has
pastures
fair
and
green
and
vineyards
that
drink
the
golden
light
which
flows
from
the
sun
bright
sheen
i
heard
the
joy
of
the
reapers
song
as
they
gathered
golden
grain
then
wearily
turned
unto
my
task
with
a
lonely
sense
of
pain
sadly
i
turned
from
the
sun
fierce
glare
and
sought
the
quiet
shade
and
over
my
dim
and
weary
eyes
sleep
peaceful
fingers
strayed
i
dreamed
i
joined
with
a
restless
throng
eager
for
pleasure
and
gain
but
ever
and
anon
a
stumbler
fell
and
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
but
the
eager
crowd
still
hurried
on
too
busy
to
pause
or
heed
when
a
voice
rang
sadly
through
my
soul
you
must
staunch
these
wounds
that
bleed
my
hands
were
weak
but
i
reached
them
out
to
feebler
ones
than
mine
renewal
of
strength
and
over
the
shadows
of
my
life
stole
the
light
of
a
peace
divine
oh
then
my
task
was
a
sacred
thing
how
precious
it
grew
in
my
eyes
was
mine
to
gather
the
bruised
grain
for
the
lord
of
paradise
and
when
the
reapers
shall
lay
their
grain
on
the
floors
of
golden
light
i
feel
that
mine
with
its
broken
sheaves
shall
be
precious
in
his
sight
though
thorns
may
often
pierce
my
feet
and
the
shadows
still
abide
the
mists
will
vanish
before
his
smile
there
will
be
light
at
eventide
renewal
of
strength
the
in
which
i
live
is
falling
to
decay
but
god
renews
my
spirit
strength
within
these
walls
of
clay
jamie
puzzle
for
me
a
dimness
slowly
creeps
around
earth
fairest
light
but
heaven
grows
clearer
to
my
view
and
fairer
to
my
sight
it
may
be
earth
sweet
harmonies
are
duller
to
my
ear
but
music
from
my
father
house
begins
to
float
more
near
then
let
the
pillars
of
my
home
crumble
and
fall
away
lo
god
dear
love
within
my
soul
renews
it
day
by
day
jamie
puzzle
there
was
grief
within
our
household
because
of
a
vacant
chair
our
mother
so
loved
and
precious
no
longer
was
sitting
there
jamie
puzzle
our
hearts
grew
heavy
with
sorrow
our
eyes
with
tears
were
blind
and
little
jamie
was
wondering
why
we
were
left
behind
we
had
told
our
little
darling
of
the
land
of
love
and
light
of
the
saints
all
crowned
with
glory
and
enrobed
in
spotless
white
we
said
that
our
precious
mother
had
gone
to
that
land
so
fair
to
dwell
with
beautiful
angels
and
to
be
forever
there
but
the
child
was
sorely
puzzled
why
dear
grandmamma
should
go
to
dwell
in
a
stranger
city
when
her
children
loved
her
so
but
again
the
mystic
angel
came
with
swift
and
silent
tread
and
our
sister
jamie
mother
was
enrolled
among
the
dead
to
us
the
mystery
deepened
to
jamie
it
seemed
more
clear
truth
grandma
he
said
must
be
lonesome
and
mamma
has
gone
to
her
but
the
question
lies
unanswered
in
our
little
jamie
mind
why
she
should
go
to
our
mother
and
leave
her
children
behind
to
dwell
in
that
lovely
city
from
all
that
was
dear
to
part
from
children
who
loved
to
nestle
so
closely
around
her
heart
dear
child
like
you
we
are
puzzled
with
problems
that
still
remain
but
think
in
the
great
hereafter
their
meaning
will
all
be
plain
truth
a
rock
for
ages
stern
and
high
stood
frowning
the
earth
and
sky
and
never
bowed
his
haughty
crest
when
angry
storms
around
him
prest
morn
springing
from
the
arms
of
night
had
often
bathed
his
brow
with
light
truth
and
kissed
the
shadows
from
his
face
with
tender
love
and
gentle
grace
day
pausing
at
the
gates
of
rest
smiled
on
him
from
the
distant
west
and
from
her
throne
the
night
threw
round
his
path
her
softest
light
and
yet
he
stood
unmoved
and
proud
nor
love
nor
wrath
his
spirit
bowed
he
bared
his
brow
to
every
blast
and
scorned
the
tempest
as
it
passed
one
day
a
tiny
humble
seed
the
keenest
eye
would
hardly
heed
fell
trembling
at
that
stern
rock
base
and
found
a
lowly
a
ray
of
light
and
drop
of
dew
came
with
a
message
kind
and
true
they
told
her
of
the
world
so
bright
its
love
its
joy
and
rosy
light
and
lured
her
from
her
to
gaze
upon
earth
glorious
face
so
peeping
timid
from
the
ground
she
clasped
the
ancient
rock
around
and
climbing
up
with
childish
grace
she
held
him
with
a
close
embrace
death
of
the
old
sea
king
her
clinging
was
a
thing
of
dread
she
touched
a
fissure
spread
and
he
who
breasted
many
a
storm
stood
frowning
there
a
mangled
form
a
truth
dropped
in
the
silent
earth
may
seem
a
thing
of
little
worth
till
spreading
round
some
mighty
wrong
it
saps
its
pillars
proud
and
strong
and
the
fallen
ruin
weaves
the
brightest
blooms
and
fairest
leaves
death
of
the
old
sea
king
was
a
fearful
night
the
tempest
raved
with
loud
and
wrathful
pride
the
harnessed
his
lightning
steeds
and
rode
on
the
raging
tide
the
lay
on
his
bed
of
death
pale
mourners
around
him
bent
they
knew
the
wild
and
fitful
life
of
their
chief
was
almost
spent
his
ear
was
growing
dull
in
death
when
the
angry
storm
he
heard
death
of
the
old
sea
king
the
sluggish
blood
in
the
old
man
veins
with
sudden
vigor
stirred
i
hear
them
call
cried
the
dying
man
his
eyes
grew
full
of
light
now
bring
me
here
my
warrior
robes
my
sword
and
armor
bright
in
the
tempest
lull
i
heard
a
voice
i
knew
was
odin
call
the
valkyrs
are
gathering
round
my
bed
to
lead
me
unto
his
hall
bear
me
unto
my
noblest
ship
light
up
a
funeral
pyre
i
walk
to
the
palace
of
the
braves
through
a
path
of
flame
and
fire
oh
wild
and
bright
was
the
stormy
light
that
flashed
from
the
old
man
eye
as
they
bore
him
from
the
couch
of
death
to
his
to
die
and
lit
with
many
a
mournful
torch
the
dying
bed
and
like
a
banner
fair
and
bright
the
flames
around
him
spread
save
the
boys
but
they
heard
no
cry
of
anguish
break
through
that
fiery
wall
with
rigid
brow
and
silent
lips
he
was
seeking
odin
hall
through
a
path
of
fearful
splendor
while
strong
men
held
their
breath
the
brave
old
man
went
boldly
forth
and
calmly
talked
with
death
save
the
boys
like
dives
in
the
deeps
of
hell
i
can
not
break
this
fearful
spell
nor
quench
the
fires
i
madly
nursed
nor
cool
this
dreadful
raging
thirst
take
back
your
pledge
ye
come
too
late
ye
can
not
save
me
from
my
fate
nor
bring
me
back
departed
joys
but
ye
can
try
to
save
the
boys
ye
bid
me
break
my
fiery
chain
arise
and
be
a
man
again
save
the
boys
when
every
street
with
snares
is
spread
and
nets
of
sin
i
tread
no
i
must
reap
as
i
did
sow
the
seeds
of
sin
bring
crops
of
woe
but
with
my
latest
breath
i
crave
that
ye
will
try
the
boys
to
save
these
bloodshot
eyes
were
once
so
bright
this
heart
was
glad
and
light
but
by
the
ruddy
glow
i
traced
a
path
to
shame
and
woe
a
captive
to
my
galling
chain
i
tried
to
rise
but
tried
in
vain
the
cup
allures
and
then
destroys
oh
from
its
thraldom
save
the
boys
take
from
your
streets
those
traps
of
hell
into
whose
gilded
snares
i
fell
oh
freemen
from
these
foul
decoys
arise
and
vote
to
save
the
boys
oh
ye
who
license
men
to
trade
in
draughts
that
charm
and
then
degrade
before
ye
hear
the
cry
too
late
oh
save
the
boys
from
my
sad
fate
nothing
and
something
nothing
and
something
it
is
nothing
to
me
the
beauty
said
with
a
careless
toss
of
her
pretty
head
the
man
is
weak
if
he
ca
refrain
from
the
cup
you
say
is
fraught
with
pain
it
was
something
to
her
in
after
years
when
her
eyes
were
drenched
with
burning
tears
and
she
watched
in
lonely
grief
and
dread
and
startled
to
hear
a
staggering
tread
it
is
nothing
to
me
the
mother
said
i
have
no
fear
that
my
boy
will
tread
in
the
downward
path
of
sin
and
shame
and
crush
my
heart
and
darken
his
name
it
was
something
to
her
when
that
only
son
from
the
path
of
right
was
early
won
and
madly
cast
in
the
flowing
bowl
a
ruined
body
and
soul
it
is
nothing
to
me
the
young
man
cried
in
his
eye
was
a
flash
of
scorn
and
pride
i
heed
not
the
dreadful
things
ye
tell
i
can
rule
myself
i
know
full
well
nothing
and
something
it
was
something
to
him
when
in
prison
he
lay
the
victim
of
drink
life
ebbing
away
and
thought
of
his
wretched
child
and
wife
and
the
mournful
wreck
of
his
wasted
life
it
is
nothing
to
me
the
merchant
said
as
over
his
ledger
he
bent
his
head
i
busy
with
tare
and
tret
and
i
have
no
time
to
fume
and
fret
it
was
something
to
him
when
over
the
wire
a
message
came
from
a
funeral
pyre
a
drunken
conductor
had
wrecked
a
train
and
his
wife
and
child
were
among
the
slain
it
is
nothing
to
me
the
voter
said
the
party
loss
is
my
greatest
dread
then
gave
his
vote
for
the
liquor
trade
though
hearts
were
crushed
and
drunkards
made
it
was
something
to
him
in
after
life
when
his
daughter
became
a
drunkard
wife
and
her
hungry
children
cried
for
bread
and
trembled
to
hear
their
father
tread
is
it
nothing
for
us
to
idly
sleep
while
the
cohorts
of
death
their
vigils
keep
to
gather
the
young
and
thoughtless
in
and
grind
in
our
midst
a
grist
of
sin
vashti
it
is
something
yes
all
for
us
to
stand
clasping
by
faith
our
saviour
hand
to
learn
to
labor
live
and
fight
on
the
side
of
god
and
changeless
light
vashti
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
heard
the
king
decree
my
lords
are
feasting
in
my
halls
bid
vashti
come
to
me
i
shown
the
treasures
of
my
house
my
costly
jewels
rare
but
with
the
glory
of
her
eyes
no
rubies
can
compare
adorn
and
crown
i
have
her
come
with
all
her
queenly
grace
and
my
lords
and
mighty
men
unveil
her
lovely
face
each
gem
that
sparkles
in
my
crown
or
glitters
on
my
throne
vashti
grows
poor
and
pale
when
she
appears
my
beautiful
my
own
all
waiting
stood
the
chamberlains
to
hear
the
queen
reply
they
saw
her
cheek
grow
deathly
pale
but
light
flash
to
her
eye
go
tell
the
king
she
proudly
said
that
i
am
persia
queen
and
by
his
crowds
of
merry
men
i
never
will
be
seen
i
take
the
crown
from
off
my
head
and
tread
it
my
feet
before
their
rude
and
careless
gaze
my
shrinking
eyes
shall
meet
a
queen
unveil
before
the
crowd
upon
each
lip
my
name
why
persia
women
all
would
blush
and
weep
for
vashti
shame
go
back
she
cried
and
waved
her
hand
and
grief
was
in
her
eye
go
tell
the
king
she
sadly
said
that
i
would
rather
die
vashti
they
brought
her
message
to
the
king
dark
flash
his
angry
eye
was
as
the
lightning
ere
the
storm
hath
swept
in
fury
by
then
bitterly
outspoke
the
king
through
purple
lips
of
wrath
what
shall
be
done
to
her
who
dares
to
cross
your
monarch
path
then
spake
his
wily
counsellors
o
king
of
this
fair
land
from
distant
ind
to
ethiop
all
bow
to
thy
command
but
if
before
thy
servants
eyes
this
thing
they
plainly
see
that
vashti
doth
not
heed
thy
will
nor
yield
herself
to
thee
the
women
restive
our
rule
would
learn
to
scorn
our
name
and
from
her
deed
to
us
would
come
reproach
and
burning
shame
then
gracious
king
sign
with
thy
hand
this
stern
but
just
decree
thank
god
for
little
children
that
vashti
lay
aside
her
crown
thy
queen
no
more
to
be
she
heard
again
the
king
command
and
left
her
high
estate
strong
in
her
earnest
womanhood
she
calmly
met
her
fate
and
left
the
palace
of
the
king
proud
of
her
spotless
name
a
woman
who
could
bend
to
grief
but
would
not
bow
to
shame
thank
god
for
little
children
thank
god
for
little
children
bright
flowers
by
earth
wayside
the
dancing
joyous
lifeboats
upon
life
stormy
tide
thank
god
for
little
children
when
our
skies
are
cold
and
gray
they
come
as
sunshine
to
our
hearts
and
charm
our
cares
away
thank
god
for
little
children
i
almost
think
the
angels
who
tend
life
garden
fair
drop
down
the
sweet
wild
blossoms
that
bloom
around
us
here
it
seems
a
breath
of
heaven
round
many
a
cradle
lies
and
every
little
baby
brings
a
message
from
the
skies
dear
mothers
guard
these
jewels
as
sacred
offerings
meet
a
wealth
of
household
treasures
to
lay
at
jesus
feet
the
martyr
of
alabama
tim
thompson
a
little
negro
boy
was
asked
to
dance
for
the
amusement
of
some
white
toughs
he
refused
saying
he
was
a
church
member
one
of
the
men
knocked
him
down
with
a
club
and
then
danced
upon
his
prostrate
form
he
then
shot
the
boy
in
the
hip
the
boy
is
dead
his
murderer
is
still
at
large
news
item
he
lifted
up
his
pleading
eyes
and
scanned
each
cruel
face
where
cold
and
brutal
cowardice
had
left
its
evil
trace
it
was
when
tender
memories
round
manger
lay
the
martyr
of
alabama
and
mothers
told
their
little
ones
of
jesu
natal
day
and
of
the
magi
from
the
east
who
came
their
gifts
to
bring
and
bow
in
at
the
feet
of
salem
king
and
how
the
herald
angels
sang
the
choral
song
of
peace
that
war
should
close
his
wrathful
lips
and
strife
and
carnage
cease
at
such
an
hour
men
well
may
hush
their
discord
and
their
strife
and
that
manger
clasp
their
hands
with
gifts
to
brighten
life
alas
that
in
our
favored
land
that
cruelty
and
crime
should
cast
their
shadows
a
day
the
fairest
pearl
of
time
a
boy
had
drawn
anear
a
band
of
savage
men
just
as
a
hapless
lamb
might
stray
into
a
tiger
den
the
martyr
of
alabama
cruel
and
dull
they
saw
in
him
for
sport
an
evil
chance
and
then
demanded
of
the
child
to
give
to
them
a
dance
come
dance
for
us
the
rough
men
said
i
ca
the
child
replied
i
can
not
for
the
dear
lord
sake
who
for
my
sins
once
died
tho
they
were
strong
and
he
was
weak
he
would
his
lord
deny
his
life
lay
in
their
cruel
hands
but
he
for
christ
could
die
heard
they
aright
did
that
brave
child
their
mandates
dare
resist
did
he
against
their
stern
commands
have
courage
to
insist
then
recklessly
a
man
arose
and
dealt
a
fearful
blow
he
crushed
the
portals
of
that
life
and
laid
the
brave
child
low
and
trampled
on
his
prostrate
form
as
on
a
broken
toy
the
martyr
of
alabama
then
danced
with
careless
brutal
feet
upon
the
murdered
boy
christians
behold
that
martyred
child
his
blood
cries
from
the
ground
before
the
sleepless
eye
of
god
he
shows
each
gaping
wound
oh
church
of
christ
arise
arise
lest
crimson
stain
thy
hand
when
god
shall
inquisition
make
for
blood
shed
in
the
land
take
sackcloth
of
the
darkest
hue
and
shroud
the
pulpits
round
servants
of
him
who
can
not
lie
sit
mourning
on
the
ground
let
holy
horror
blanch
each
brow
pale
every
cheek
with
fears
and
rocks
and
stones
if
ye
could
speak
ye
well
might
melt
to
tears
through
every
fane
send
forth
a
cry
of
sorrow
and
regret
nor
in
an
hour
of
careless
ease
thy
brother
wrongs
forget
the
night
of
death
veil
not
thine
eyes
nor
close
thy
lips
nor
speak
with
bated
breath
this
evil
shall
not
always
last
the
end
of
it
is
death
avert
the
doom
that
crime
must
bring
upon
a
guilty
land
strong
in
the
strength
that
god
supplies
for
truth
and
justice
stand
for
christless
men
with
reckless
hands
are
sowing
round
thy
path
the
tempests
wild
that
yet
shall
break
in
whirlwinds
of
god
wrath
the
night
of
death
twas
a
night
of
dreadful
horror
death
was
sweeping
through
the
land
and
the
wings
of
dark
destruction
were
outstretched
from
strand
to
strand
strong
men
hearts
grew
faint
with
terror
as
the
tempest
and
the
waves
the
night
of
death
wrecked
their
homes
and
swept
them
downward
suddenly
to
yawning
graves
the
wastes
of
ruined
households
and
the
tempest
wild
alarms
stood
a
mother
with
a
child
within
her
arms
other
children
huddled
her
each
one
nestling
in
her
heart
swift
in
thought
and
swift
in
action
she
at
least
from
one
must
part
then
she
said
unto
her
daughter
strive
to
save
one
child
from
death
which
one
said
the
anxious
daughter
as
she
stood
with
bated
breath
oh
the
anguish
of
that
mother
what
despair
was
in
her
eye
all
her
little
ones
were
precious
which
one
should
she
leave
to
die
then
outspake
the
brother
bennie
i
will
take
the
little
one
no
exclaimed
the
anxious
mother
no
my
child
it
ca
be
done
the
night
of
death
see
my
boy
the
waves
are
rising
save
yourself
and
leave
the
child
i
will
trust
in
christ
he
answered
grasped
the
little
one
and
smiled
through
the
roar
of
wind
and
waters
ever
and
anon
she
cried
but
throughout
the
night
of
terror
never
bennie
voice
replied
but
above
the
waves
wild
surging
he
had
found
a
safe
retreat
as
if
god
had
sent
an
angel
just
to
guide
his
wandering
feet
when
the
storm
had
spent
its
fury
and
the
sea
gave
up
its
dead
she
was
mourning
for
her
loved
ones
lost
amid
that
night
of
dread
while
her
head
was
bowed
in
anguish
on
her
ear
there
fell
a
voice
bringing
surcease
to
her
sorrow
bidding
all
her
heart
rejoice
did
i
tell
you
true
said
bennie
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
light
mother
treasures
when
i
told
you
god
would
help
me
through
the
dark
and
dreadful
night
and
he
placed
the
little
darling
safe
within
his
mother
arms
feeling
christ
had
been
his
guardian
the
dangers
and
alarms
oh
for
faith
so
firm
and
precious
in
the
darkest
saddest
night
till
life
shadows
fade
in
everlasting
light
and
upon
the
mount
of
vision
we
our
loved
and
lost
shall
greet
with
earth
wildest
storms
behind
us
and
its
cares
beneath
our
feet

my
noble
boy

heart
with
joy
i
hold
them
as
a
sacred
trust
i
fain
would
hide
them
in
my
heart
safe
from
tarnish
of
moth
and
rust
what
should
i
ask
for
my
dear
boy
the
richest
gifts
of
wealth
or
fame
what
for
my
girl
a
loving
heart
and
a
fair
and
a
spotless
name
what
for
my
boy
that
he
should
stand
a
pillar
of
strength
to
the
state
what
for
my
girl
that
she
should
be

friend
of
the
poor
and
desolate
i
do
not
ask
they
shall
never
tread
with
weary
feet
the
paths
of
pain
i
ask
that
in
the
darkest
hour
they
may
faithful
and
true
remain
i
only
ask
their
lives
may
be
pure
as
gems
in
the
gates
of
pearl
lives
to
brighten
and
bless
the
world
this
i
ask
for
my
boy
and
girl
the
refiner
gold
i
ask
to
clasp
their
hands
again
the
holy
hosts
of
heaven
enraptured
say
i
am
here
oh
god
and
the
children
thou
hast
given
the
refiner
gold
he
stood
before
my
heart
closed
door
and
asked
to
enter
in
but
i
had
barred
the
passage
by
unbelief
and
sin
he
came
with
in
his
hands
to
set
my
spirit
free
with
wounded
feet
he
trod
a
path
to
come
and
sup
with
me
he
found
me
poor
and
brought
me
gold
the
fire
of
love
had
tried
and
garments
whitened
by
his
blood
my
wretchedness
to
hide
the
glare
of
life
had
dimmed
my
eyes
its
glamour
was
too
bright
he
came
with
ointment
in
his
hands
to
heal
my
darkened
sight
the
refiner
gold
he
knew
my
heart
was
by
care
and
pain
oppressed
he
whispered
to
my
burdened
heart
come
unto
me
and
rest
he
found
me
weary
faint
and
worn
on
barren
mountains
cold
with
love
constraint
he
drew
me
on
to
shelter
in
his
fold
oh
foolish
heart
how
slow
wert
thou
to
welcome
thy
dear
guest
to
change
thy
weariness
and
care
for
comfort
peace
and
rest
close
to
his
side
oh
may
i
stay
just
to
behold
his
face
till
i
shall
wear
within
my
soul
the
image
of
his
grace
the
grace
that
changes
hearts
of
stone
to
tenderness
and
love
and
bids
us
run
with
willing
feet
unto
his
courts
above
a
story
of
the
rebellion
a
story
of
the
rebellion
the
treacherous
sands
had
caught
our
boat
and
held
it
with
a
strong
embrace
and
death
at
our
imprisoned
crew
was
sternly
looking
face
to
face
with
anxious
hearts
but
failing
strength
we
strove
to
push
the
boat
from
shore
but
all
in
vain
for
there
we
lay
with
bated
breath
and
useless
oar
around
us
in
a
fearful
storm
the
fiery
hail
fell
thick
and
fast
and
we
engirded
by
the
sand
could
not
return
the
dreadful
blast
when
one
arose
upon
whose
brow
the
ardent
sun
had
left
his
trace
a
noble
purpose
strong
and
high
uplighting
all
his
dusky
face
perchance
within
that
fateful
hour
the
wrongs
of
ages
thronged
apace
but
with
it
came
the
glorious
hope
of
swift
deliverance
to
his
race
of
galling
chains
asunder
rent
of
severed
hearts
again
made
one
a
story
of
the
rebellion
of
freedom
crowning
all
the
land
through
battles
gained
and
victories
won
some
one
our
hero
firmly
said
must
die
to
get
us
out
of
this
then
leaped
upon
the
strand
and
bared
his
bosom
to
the
bullets
hiss
but
ye
are
soldiers
and
can
fight
may
win
in
battles
yet
unfought
i
have
no
offering
but
my
life
and
if
they
kill
me
it
is
nought
with
steady
hands
he
grasped
the
boat
and
boldly
pushed
it
from
the
shore
then
fell
by
rebel
bullets
pierced
his
life
work
grandly
nobly
our
boat
was
rescued
from
the
sands
and
launched
in
safety
on
the
tide
but

and
grand
in
our
defence

tenderly
the

mourner
face
and
said
oh

dead

her
the
sepulchres

let
me
buy
the
place
where
i
may
lay
my
dead
and
with
the
promise
in
his
heart
his
seed
should
own
that
land
he
gave
the
shekels
for
the
field
he
took
from
ephron
hand
and
saw
afar
the
glorious
day
his
chosen
seed
should
tread
the
soil
where
he
in
sorrow
lay
his
loved
and
cherished
dead
going
east
she
came
from
the
east
a
fair
young
bride
with
a
light
and
a
bounding
heart
to
find
in
the
distant
west
a
home
with
her
husband
to
make
a
start
going
east
he
builded
his
cabin
far
away
where
the
prairie
flower
bloomed
wild
her
love
made
lighter
all
his
toil
and
joy
and
hope
around
him
smiled
she
plied
her
hands
to
life
homely
tasks
and
helped
to
build
his
fortunes
up
while
joy
and
grief
like
bitter
and
sweet
were
mingled
and
mixed
in
her
cup
he
sowed
in
his
fields
of
golden
grain
all
the
strength
of
his
manly
prime
nor
music
of
birds
nor
brooks
nor
bees
was
as
sweet
as
the
dollar
chime
she
toiled
and
waited
through
weary
years
for
the
fortune
that
came
at
length
but
toil
and
care
and
hope
deferred
had
stolen
and
wasted
her
strength
the
cabin
changed
to
a
stately
home
rich
carpets
were
hushing
her
tread
but
light
was
fading
from
her
eye
and
the
bloom
from
her
cheek
had
fled
slower
and
heavier
grew
her
step
while
his
gold
and
his
gains
increased
going
east
but
his
proud
domain
had
not
the
charm
of
her
humble
home
in
the
east
within
her
eye
was
a
restless
light
and
a
yearning
that
never
ceased
a
longing
to
see
the
dear
old
home
she
had
left
in
the
distant
east
a
longing
to
clasp
her
mother
hand
and
nestle
close
to
her
heart
and
to
feel
the
heavy
cares
of
life
like
the
shadows
depart
her
husband
was
adding
field
to
field
and
new
wealth
to
his
golden
store
and
little
thought
the
shadow
of
death
was
entering
in
at
his
door
he
had
no
line
to
sound
the
depths
of
her
tears
repressed
and
unshed
nor
dreamed
plenty
a
human
heart
could
be
starving
but
not
for
bread
the
hungry
heart
was
stilled
at
last
its
restless
baffled
yearning
ceased
a
lonely
man
sat
by
the
bier
of
a
corpse
that
was
going
east
the
hermit
sacrifice
the
hermit
sacrifice
from
rome
palaces
and
villas
gaily
issued
forth
a
throng
from
her
humbler
habitations
moved
a
human
tide
along
haughty
dames
and
blooming
maidens
men
who
knew
not
mercy
sway
thronged
into
the
coliseum
on
that
roman
holiday
from
the
lonely
wilds
of
asia
from
her
jungles
far
away
from
the
distant
torrid
regions
rome
had
gathered
beasts
of
prey
lions
restless
roaring
rampant
tigers
with
their
stealthy
tread
leopards
bright
and
fierce
and
fiery
met
in
conflict
wild
and
dread
fierce
and
fearful
was
the
carnage
of
the
maddened
beasts
of
prey
as
they
fought
and
rent
each
other
urged
by
men
more
fierce
than
they
till
like
muffled
thunders
breaking
on
a
vast
and
distant
shore
the
hermit
sacrifice
fainter
grew
the
yells
of
tigers
and
the
lions
dreadful
roar
on
the
arena
lay
the
victims
of
the
fight
eyes
which
once
had
glared
with
anguish
lost
in
death
their
baleful
light
then
uprose
the
gladiators
armed
for
conflict
unto
death
waiting
for
the
prefect
signal
cold
and
stern
with
bated
breath
ave
caesar
morituri
te
salutant
rose
the
cry
from
the
lips
of
men
doomed
to
suffer
and
to
die
then
began
the
dreadful
contest
lives
like
chaff
were
thrown
away
rome
with
all
her
pride
and
power
butchered
for
a
holiday
eagerly
the
crowd
were
waiting
loud
the
clashing
sabres
rang
when
between
the
gladiators
all
unarmed
a
hermit
sprang
the
hermit
sacrifice
cease
your
bloodshed
cried
the
hermit
on
this
carnage
place
your
ban
but
with
flashing
swords
they
answered
back
unto
your
place
old
man
from
their
path
the
gladiators
thrust
the
strange
intruder
back
who
between
their
hosts
advancing
calmly
parried
their
attack
all
undaunted
by
their
weapons
stood
the
old
heroic
man
while
a
maddened
cry
of
anger
through
the
vast
assembly
ran
down
with
him
cried
out
the
people
as
with
thumbs
unbent
they
glared
till
the
prefect
gave
the
signal
that
his
life
should
not
be
spared
men
grew
wild
with
wrathful
passion
when
his
fearless
words
were
said
cruelly
they
fiercely
showered
stones
on
his
devoted
head
bruised
and
bleeding
fell
the
hermit
victor
in
that
hour
of
strife
songs
for
the
people
gaining
in
his
death
a
triumph
that
he
could
not
win
in
life
had
he
uttered
on
the
forum
struggling
thoughts
within
him
born
men
had
jeered
his
words
as
madness
but
his
deed
they
could
not
scorn
not
in
vain
had
been
his
courage
nor
for
naught
his
daring
deed
from
his
grave
his
mangled
body
did
for
wretched
captives
plead
from
that
hour
rome
grown
more
thoughtful
ceased
her
sport
in
human
gore
and
into
her
coliseum
gladiators
came
no
more
songs
for
the
people
let
me
make
the
songs
for
the
people
songs
for
the
old
and
young
songs
to
stir
like
a
wherever
they
are
sung
not
for
the
clashing
of
sabres
for
carnage
nor
for
strife
songs
for
the
people
but
songs
to
thrill
the
hearts
of
men
with
more
abundant
life
let
me
make
the
songs
for
the
weary
amid
life
fever
and
fret
till
hearts
shall
relax
their
tension
and
careworn
brows
forget
let
me
sing
for
little
children
before
their
footsteps
stray
sweet
anthems
of
love
and
duty
to
float
life
highway
i
would
sing
for
the
poor
and
aged
when
shadows
dim
their
sight
of
the
bright
and
restful
mansions
where
there
shall
be
no
night
our
world
so
worn
and
weary
needs
music
pure
and
strong
to
hush
the
jangle
and
discords
of
sorrow
pain
and
wrong
music
to
soothe
all
its
sorrow
till
war
and
crime
shall
cease
and
the
hearts
of
men
grown
tender
girdle
the
world
with
peace
let
the
light
enter
let
the
light
enter
the
dying
words
of
goethe
light
more
light
the
shadows
deepen
and
my
life
is
ebbing
low
throw
the
windows
widely
open
light
more
light
before
i
go
softly
let
the
balmy
sunshine
play
around
my
dying
bed
the
dimly
lighted
valley
i
with
lonely
feet
must
tread
light
more
light
for
death
is
weaving
shadows
my
waning
sight
and
i
fain
would
gaze
upon
him
through
a
stream
of
earthly
light
not
for
greater
gifts
of
genius
not
for
thoughts
more
grandly
bright
all
the
dying
poet
whispers
is
a
prayer
for
light
more
light
heeds
he
not
the
gathered
laurels
fading
slowly
from
his
sight
all
the
poet
aspirations
centre
in
that
prayer
for
light
an
appeal
to
my
countrywomen
gracious
saviour
when
life
melt
and
vanish
from
the
sight
may
our
dim
and
longing
vision
then
be
blessed
with
light
more
light
an
appeal
to
my
countrywomen
you
can
sigh
the
armenian
who
weeps
in
her
desolate
home
you
can
mourn
the
exile
of
russia
from
kindred
and
friends
doomed
to
roam
you
can
pity
the
men
who
have
woven
from
passion
and
appetite
chains
to
coil
with
a
terrible
tension
around
their
heartstrings
and
brains
you
can
sorrow
little
children
disinherited
from
their
birth
the
wee
waifs
and
toddlers
neglected
robbed
of
sunshine
music
and
mirth
for
beasts
you
have
gentle
compassion
your
mercy
and
pity
they
share
for
the
wretched
outcast
and
fallen
you
have
tenderness
love
and
care
an
appeal
to
my
countrywomen
but
hark
from
our
southland
are
floating
sobs
of
anguish
murmurs
of
pain
and
women
are
weeping
over
their
tortured
and
their
slain
on
their
brows
the
sun
has
left
traces
shrink
not
from
their
sorrow
in
scorn
when
they
entered
the
threshold
of
being
the
children
of
a
king
were
born
each
comes
as
a
guest
to
the
table
the
hand
of
our
god
has
outspread
to
fountains
that
ever
leap
upward
to
share
in
the
soil
we
all
tread
when
ye
plead
for
the
wrecked
and
fallen
the
exile
from
shores
remember
that
men
are
still
wasting
life
crimson
around
your
own
doors
have
ye
not
oh
my
favored
sisters
just
a
plea
a
prayer
or
a
tear
for
mothers
who
dwell
the
shadows
of
agony
hatred
and
fear
men
may
tread
down
the
poor
and
lowly
may
crush
them
in
anger
and
hate
an
appeal
to
my
countrywomen
but
surely
the
mills
of
god
justice
will
grind
out
the
grist
of
their
fate
oh
people
and
guilty
so
lusty
and
proud
in
your
prime
the
sharp
sickles
of
god
retribution
will
gather
your
harvest
of
crime
weep
not
oh
my
sisters
weep
not
for
the
negro
alone
but
weep
for
your
sons
who
must
gather
the
crops
which
their
fathers
have
sown
go
read
on
the
tombstones
of
nations
of
chieftains
who
masterful
trod
the
sentence
which
time
has
engraven
that
they
had
forgotten
their
god
is
the
judgment
of
god
that
men
reap
the
tares
which
in
madness
they
sow
sorrow
follows
the
footsteps
of
crime
and
sin
is
the
consort
of
woe
then
and
now
then
and
now
build
me
a
nation
said
the
lord
the
distant
nations
heard
the
word
build
me
a
nation
true
and
strong
bar
out
the
old
world
hate
and
wrong
for
men
had
traced
with
blood
and
tears
the
trail
of
weary
wasting
years
and
torn
and
bleeding
martyrs
trod
through
fire
and
torture
up
to
god
while
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
god
hid
the
secret
of
our
land
men
warred
against
their
fiercest
foes
and
kingdoms
fell
and
empires
rose
till
weary
of
the
old
world
strife
men
sought
for
broader
freer
life
and
plunged
into
the
ocean
foam
to
find
another
better
home
and
like
a
vision
fair
and
bright
the
new
world
broke
upon
their
sight
men
grasped
the
prize
grew
proud
and
strong
and
cursed
the
land
with
crime
and
wrong
the
indian
stood
despoiled
of
lands
the
negro
bound
with
servile
bands
oppressed
through
weary
years
of
toil
his
blood
and
tears
bedewed
the
soil
then
and
now
then
god
arose
in
dreadful
wrath
and
judgment
streamed
around
his
path
his
hand
the
captive
fetters
broke
his
lightnings
shattered
every
yoke
as
israel
through
the
red
sea
trod
led
by
the
mighty
hand
of
god
they
passed
to
freedom
through
a
flood
whose
every
wave
and
surge
was
blood
and
slavery
with
its
crime
and
shame
went
down
in
wrath
and
blood
and
flame
the
land
was
with
graves

had
lived
and
died
as

four
and
thirty
years
what

since
then
beings
once
chattles
now

over
the
gloom
of

night
has
flashed
the
dawn
of

with
anguish
wild
kneels
and
implores
that
her
darling
child
shall
not
be
torn
from
her

heart
with
its
quivering
tendrils

apart
the

he
maketh
all
things
new
fishers
of
men
i
had
a
dream
a
varied
dream
before
my
ravished
sight
the
city
of
my
lord
arose
with
all
its
love
and
light
the
music
of
a
myriad
harps
flowed
out
with
sweet
accord
and
saints
were
casting
down
their
crowns
in
homage
to
our
lord
fishers
of
men
my
heart
leaped
up
with
untold
joy
life
toil
and
pain
were
my
weary
feet
at
last
had
found
the
bright
and
restful
shore
just
as
i
reached
the
gates
of
light
ready
to
enter
in
from
earth
arose
a
fearful
cry
of
sorrow
and
of
sin
i
turned
and
saw
behind
me
surge
a
wild
and
stormy
sea
and
drowning
men
were
reaching
out
imploring
hands
to
me
and
lip
was
blanched
with
dread
and
moaning
for
relief
the
music
of
the
golden
harps
grew
fainter
for
their
grief
let
me
return
i
quickly
said
close
to
the
pearly
gate
my
work
is
with
these
wretched
ones
so
wrecked
and
desolate
an
angel
smiled
and
gently
said
this
is
the
gate
of
life
wilt
thou
return
to
earth
sad
scenes
its
weariness
and
strife
signing
the
pledge
to
comfort
hearts
that
sigh
and
break
to
dry
the
falling
tear
wilt
thou
forego
the
music
sweet
entrancing
now
thy
ear
i
must
return
i
firmly
said
the
strugglers
in
that
sea
shall
not
reach
out
beseeching
hands
in
vain
for
help
to
me
i
turned
to
go
but
as
i
turned
the
gloomy
sea
grew
bright
and
from
my
heart
there
seemed
to
flow
ten
thousand
cords
of
light
and
men
with
eager
hands
did
grasp
each
golden
cord
and
with
my
heart
i
drew
them
on
to
see
my
gracious
lord
again
i
stood
beside
the
gate
my
heart
was
glad
and
free
for
with
me
stood
a
rescued
throng
the
lord
had
given
me
the
lost
bells
the
lost
bells
year
after
year
the
artist
wrought
with
earnest
loving
care
the
music
flooding
all
his
soul
to
pour
upon
the
air
for
this
no
metal
was
too
rare
he
counted
not
the
cost
nor
deemed
the
years
in
which
he
toiled
as
labor
vainly
lost
when
morning
flushed
with
crimson
light
the
golden
gates
of
day
he
longed
to
fill
the
air
with
chimes
sweet
as
a
matin
lay
and
when
the
sun
was
sinking
low
within
the
distant
west
he
gladly
heard
the
bells
he
wrought
herald
the
hour
of
rest
the
music
of
a
thousand
harps
could
never
be
so
dear
as
when
those
solemn
chants
and
thrills
fell
on
his
ear
he
poured
his
soul
into
their
chimes
and
felt
his
toil
repaid
he
called
them
children
of
his
soul
his
home
them
made
the
lost
bells
but
evil
days
came
on
apace
war
spread
his
banner
wide
and
from
his
village
snatched
away
the
artist
love
and
pride
at
dewy
morn
and
stilly
eve
the
chimes
no
more
he
heard
with
dull
and
restless
agony
his
spirit
depths
was
stirred
a
weary
longing
filled
his
soul
it
bound
him
like
a
spell
he
left
his
home
to
seek
the
chimes
the
chimes
he
loved
so
well
where
lofty
fanes
in
grandeur
rose
upon
his
ear
there
fell
no
music
like
the
long
lost
chimes
of
his
beloved
bell
and
thus
he
wandered
year
by
year
touched
by
the
hand
of
time
seeking
to
hear
with
anxious
heart
each
well
remembered
chime
and
to
that
worn
and
weary
heart
there
came
a
glad
surcease
he
heard
again
the
dear
old
chimes
and
smiled
and
uttered
peace
the
lost
bells
the
chimes
the
chimes
the
old
man
cried
i
hear
their
tones
at
last
a
sudden
rapture
filled
his
heart
and
all
his
cares
were
past
yes
peace
had
come
with
death
sweet
calm
his
journeying
was
the
weary
restless
wanderer
had
reached
the
restful
shore
it
may
be
that
he
met
again
enfolded
in
the
air
the
dear
old
chimes
beside
the
gates
where
all
is
bright
and
fair
that
he
who
crossed
and
bowed
his
head
when
angelus
was
sung
in
clearer
light
touched
golden
harps
by
angel
fingers
strung
do
not
cheer
men
are
dying
do
not
cheer
men
are
dying
said
capt
phillips
in
the
war
do
not
cheer
for
men
are
dying
from
their
distant
homes
in
pain
and
the
restless
sea
is
darkened
by
a
flood
of
crimson
rain
do
not
cheer
for
anxious
mothers
wait
and
watch
in
lonely
dread
vainly
waiting
for
the
footsteps
never
more
their
paths
to
tread
do
not
cheer
while
little
children
gather
round
the
widowed
wife
wondering
why
an
unknown
people
sought
their
own
dear
father
life
do
not
cheer
for
aged
fathers
bend
above
their
staves
and
weep
while
the
ocean
sings
the
requiem
where
their
fallen
children
sleep
do
not
cheer
for
lips
are
paling
on
which
lay
the
mother
kiss
the
dreadful
roar
of
battle
how
that
mother
hand
they
miss
do
not
cheer
men
are
dying
do
not
cheer
once
joyous
maidens
who
the
mazy
dance
did
tread
bow
their
heads
in
bitter
anguish
mourning
their
cherished
dead
do
not
cheer
while
maid
and
matron
in
this
strife
must
bear
a
part
while
the
blow
that
strikes
a
soldier
reaches
to
some
woman
heart
do
not
cheer
till
arbitration
the
nations
holds
its
sway
and
the
century
now
closing
ushers
in
a
brighter
day
do
not
cheer
until
the
nation
shall
more
wise
and
thoughtful
grow
than
to
staunch
a
stream
of
sorrow
by
an
avalanche
of
woe
do
not
cheer
until
each
nation
sheathes
the
sword
and
blunts
the
spear
and
we
sing
aloud
for
gladness
lo
the
reign
of
christ
is
here
and
the
banners
of
destruction
from
the
battlefield
are
furled
and
the
peace
of
god
descending
rests
upon
a
restless
world
the
burdens
of
all
the
burdens
of
all
we
may
sigh
the
heavy
burdens
of
the
black
the
brown
and
white
but
if
we
all
clasped
hands
together
the
burdens
would
be
more
light
how
to
solve
life
saddest
problems
its
weariness
want
and
woe
was
answered
by
one
who
suffered
in
palestine
long
ago
he
gave
from
his
heart
this
precept
to
ease
the
burdens
of
men
as
ye
would
that
others
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
life
heavy
wearisome
burdens
will
change
to
a
gracious
trust
when
men
shall
learn
in
the
light
of
god
to
be
merciful
and
just
where
war
has
sharpened
his
weapons
and
slavery
masterful
had
let
white
and
black
and
brown
unite
to
build
the
kingdom
of
god
and
never
attempt
in
madness
to
build
a
kingdom
or
state
through
greed
of
gold
or
lust
of
power
on
the
crumbling
stones
of
hate
the
burdens
will
always
he
heavy
the
sunshine
fade
into
night
till
mercy
and
justice
shall
cement
the
black
the
brown
and
the
white
and
earth
shall
answer
with
gladness
the
herald
angel
refrain
when
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
men
was
the
burden
of
their
strain
