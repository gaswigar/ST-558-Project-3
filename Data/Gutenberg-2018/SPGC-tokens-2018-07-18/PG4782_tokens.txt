when
we
dead
awaken
by
henrik
ibsen
introduction
and
translation
by
william
archer
introduction
from
of
to
gabriel
ibsen
plays
had
followed
each
other
at
regular
intervals
of
two
years
save
when
his
indignation
over
the
abuse
heaped
upon
reduced
to
a
single
year
the
interval
between
that
play
and
enemy
of
the
gabriel
having
appeared
in
its
successor
was
expected
in
but
christmas
came
and
brought
no
rumour
of
a
new
play
in
a
man
now
over
seventy
this
breach
of
a
habit
seemed
ominous
the
new
national
theatre
in
christiania
was
opened
in
september
of
the
following
year
and
when
i
then
met
ibsen
for
the
last
time
he
told
me
that
he
was
actually
at
work
on
a
new
play
which
he
thought
of
calling
a
dramatic
epilogue
he
wrote
we
dead
says
elias
with
such
labour
and
such
passionate
agitation
so
spasmodically
and
so
feverishly
that
those
around
him
were
almost
alarmed
he
must
get
on
with
it
he
must
get
on
he
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
dark
pinions
over
his
head
he
seemed
to
feel
the
grim
visitant
who
had
accompanied
alfred
allmers
on
the
mountain
paths
already
standing
behind
him
with
uplifted
hand
his
relatives
are
firmly
convinced
that
he
knew
quite
clearly
that
this
would
be
his
last
play
that
he
was
to
write
no
more
and
soon
the
blow
fell
we
dead
was
published
very
shortly
before
christmas
he
had
still
a
year
of
comparative
health
before
him
we
find
him
in
march
writing
to
count
prozor
i
can
not
say
yet
whether
or
not
i
shall
write
another
drama
but
if
i
continue
to
retain
the
vigour
of
body
and
mind
which
i
at
present
enjoy
i
do
not
imagine
that
i
shall
be
able
to
keep
permanently
away
from
the
old
battlefields
however
if
i
were
to
make
my
appearance
again
it
would
be
with
new
weapons
and
in
new
armour
was
he
hinting
at
the
desire
which
he
had
long
ago
confessed
to
professor
herford
that
his
last
work
should
be
a
drama
in
verse
whatever
his
dream
it
was
not
to
be
realised
his
last
letter
defending
his
attitude
of
philosophic
impartiality
with
regard
to
the
south
african
war
is
dated
december
with
the
dawn
of
the
new
century
the
curtain
descended
upon
the
mind
of
the
great
dramatic
poet
of
the
age
which
had
passed
away
we
dead
was
acted
during
at
most
of
the
leading
theatres
in
scandinavia
and
germany
in
some
german
cities
notably
in
frankfort
on
main
it
even
attained
a
considerable
number
of
representatives
i
can
not
learn
however
that
it
has
anywhere
held
the
stage
it
was
produced
in
london
by
the
state
society
at
the
imperial
theatre
on
january
and
titheradge
played
rubek
miss
henrietta
watson
irene
miss
mabel
hackney
maia
and
laurence
irving
ulfheim
i
find
no
record
of
any
american
performance
in
the
letter
to
count
prozor
ibsen
confirmed
that
critic
conjecture
that
the
series
which
ends
with
the
epilogue
really
began
with
master
as
the
last
confession
so
to
speak
of
a
great
artist
the
epilogue
will
always
be
read
with
interest
it
contains
moreover
many
flashes
of
the
old
genius
many
strokes
of
the
old
incommunicable
magic
one
may
say
with
perfect
sincerity
that
there
is
more
fascination
in
the
dregs
of
ibsen
mind
than
in
the
first
sprightly
running
of
more
talents
but
to
his
sane
admirers
the
interest
of
the
play
must
always
be
melancholy
because
it
is
purely
pathological
to
deny
this
is
in
my
opinion
to
cast
a
slur
over
all
the
poet
previous
work
and
in
great
measure
to
justify
the
criticisms
of
his
most
violent
detractors
for
we
dead
is
very
like
the
sort
of
play
that
haunted
the
imagination
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
it
is
a
piece
of
a
series
of
echoes
from
all
the
earlier
plays
an
exaggeration
of
manner
to
the
pitch
of
mannerism
moreover
in
his
treatment
of
his
symbolic
motives
ibsen
did
exactly
what
he
had
hitherto
with
perfect
justice
plumed
himself
upon
never
doing
he
sacrificed
the
surface
reality
to
the
underlying
meaning
take
for
instance
the
history
of
statue
and
its
development
into
a
group
in
actual
sculpture
this
development
is
a
grotesque
impossibility
in
conceiving
it
we
are
deserting
the
domain
of
reality
and
plunging
into
some
fourth
dimension
where
the
properties
of
matter
are
other
than
those
we
know
this
is
an
abandonment
of
the
fundamental
principle
which
ibsen
over
and
over
again
emphatically
expressed
namely
that
any
symbolism
his
work
might
be
found
to
contain
was
entirely
incidental
and
subordinate
to
the
truth
and
consistency
of
his
picture
of
life
even
when
he
dallied
with
the
supernatural
as
in
master
and
he
was
always
careful
as
i
have
tried
to
show
not
to
overstep
decisively
the
boundaries
of
the
natural
here
on
the
other
hand
without
any
suggestion
of
the
supernatural
we
are
confronted
with
the
wholly
impossible
the
inconceivable
how
remote
is
this
alike
from
his
principles
of
art
and
from
the
consistent
unvarying
practice
of
his
better
years
so
great
is
the
chasm
between
gabriel
and
we
dead
that
one
could
almost
suppose
his
mental
breakdown
to
have
preceded
instead
of
followed
the
writing
of
the
latter
play
certainly
it
is
one
of
the
premonitions
of
the
coming
end
it
is
robert
of
to
pretend
to
rank
it
with
his
masterpieces
is
to
show
a
very
imperfect
sense
of
the
nature
of
their
mastery

wears

for

though
waiting
for

to
say
something
then
lets
her
paper
drop
with
a
deep
sigh
oh
dear
dear
dear
professor
rubek
looks
up
from
his
paper
well
maia
what
is
the
matter
with
you
maia
just
listen
how
silent
it
is
here
professor
rubek
smiles
indulgently
and
you
can
hear
that
maia
what
professor
rubek
the
silence
maia
yes
indeed
i
can
professor
rubek
well
perhaps
you
are
right
one
can
really
hear
the
silence
maia
heaven
knows
you
can
when
it
so
absolutely
overpowering
as
it
is
here
professor
rubek
here
at
the
baths
you
mean
maia
wherever
you
go
at
home
here
it
seems
to
me
of
course
there
was
noise
and
bustle
enough
in
the
town
but
i
do
know
how
it
is
even
the
noise
and
bustle
seemed
to
have
something
dead
about
it
professor
rubek
with
a
searching
glance
you
do
seem
particularly
glad
to
be
at
home
again
maia
maia
looks
at
him
are
you
glad
professor
rubek
evasively
i
maia
yes
you
who
have
been
so
much
much
further
away
than
i
are
you
entirely
happy
now
that
you
are
at
home
again
professor
rubek
no
to
be
quite
candid
perhaps
not
entirely
happy
maia
with
animation
there
you
see
did
i
know
it
professor
rubek
i
have
been
too
long
abroad
i
have
drifted
quite
away
from
all
this
this
home
life
maia
eagerly
drawing
her
chair
nearer
him
there
you
see
rubek
we
had
much
better
get
away
again
as
quickly
as
ever
we
can
professor
rubek
somewhat
impatiently
well
well
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do
my
dear
maia
you
know
that
maia
but
why
not
now
at
once
only
think
how
cozy
and
comfortable
we
could
be
down
there
in
our
lovely
new
house
professor
rubek
smiles
indulgently
we
ought
by
rights
to
say
our
lovely
new
home
maia
shortly
i
prefer
to
say
house
let
us
keep
to
that
professor
rubek
his
eyes
dwelling
on
her
you
are
really
a
strange
little
person
maia
am
i
so
strange
professor
rubek
yes
i
think
so
maia
but
why
pray
perhaps
because
i
not
desperately
in
love
with
mooning
about
up
here
professor
rubek
which
of
us
was
it
that
was
absolutely
bent
on
our
coming
north
this
summer
maia
i
admit
it
was
i
professor
rubek
it
was
certainly
not
i
at
any
rate
maia
but
good
heavens
who
could
have
dreamt
that
everything
would
have
altered
so
terribly
at
home
here
and
in
so
short
a
time
too
why
it
is
only
just
four
years
since
i
went
away
professor
rubek
since
you
were
married
yes
maia
married
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
matter
professor
rubek
continuing
since
you
became
the
frau
professor
and
found
yourself
mistress
of
a
charming
home
i
beg
your
pardon
a
very
handsome
house
i
ought
to
say
and
a
villa
on
the
lake
of
taunitz
just
at
the
point
that
has
become
most
fashionable
too
in
fact
it
is
all
very
handsome
and
distinguished
maia
there
no
denying
that
and
spacious
too
we
need
not
always
be
getting
in
each
other
way
maia
lightly
no
no
no
there
certainly
no
lack
of
and
that
sort
of
thing
professor
rubek
remember
too
that
you
have
been
living
in
altogether
more
spacious
and
distinguished
surroundings
in
more
polished
society
than
you
were
accustomed
to
at
home
maia
looking
at
him
ah
so
you
think
it
is
that
have
changed
professor
rubek
indeed
i
do
maia
maia
i
alone
not
the
people
here
professor
rubek
oh
yes
they
too
a
little
perhaps
and
not
at
all
in
the
direction
of
amiability
that
i
readily
admit
maia
i
should
think
you
must
admit
it
indeed
professor
rubek
changing
the
subject
do
you
know
how
it
affects
me
when
i
look
at
the
life
of
the
people
around
us
here
maia
no
tell
me
professor
rubek
it
makes
me
think
of
that
night
we
spent
in
the
train
when
we
were
coming
up
here
maia
why
you
were
sound
asleep
all
the
time
professor
rubek
not
quite
i
noticed
how
silent
it
became
at
all
the
little
roadside
stations
i
heard
the
silence
like
you
maia
maia
h
like
me
yes
professor
rubek
and
that
assured
me
that
we
had
crossed
the
frontier
that
we
were
really
at
home
for
the
train
stopped
at
all
the
little
stations
although
there
was
nothing
doing
at
all
maia
then
why
did
it
stop
though
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
professor
rubek
ca
say
no
one
got
out
or
in
but
all
the
same
the
train
stopped
a
long
endless
time
and
at
every
station
i
could
make
out
that
there
were
two
railway
men
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
one
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
and
they
said
things
to
each
other
in
the
night
low
and
toneless
and
meaningless
maia
yes
that
is
quite
true
there
are
always
two
men
walking
up
and
down
and
talking
professor
rubek
of
nothing
changing
to
a
livelier
tone
but
just
wait
till
then
we
shall
have
the
great
luxurious
steamer
lying
in
the
harbour
we
go
on
board
her
and
sail
all
round
the
coast
northward
ho
right
to
the
polar
sea
maia
yes
but
then
you
will
see
nothing
of
the
country
and
of
the
people
and
that
was
what
you
particularly
wanted
professor
rubek
shortly
and
snappishly
i
have
seen
more
than
enough
maia
do
you
think
a
sea
voyage
will
be
better
for
you
professor
rubek
it
is
always
a
change
maia
well
well
if
only
it
is
the
right
thing
for
you
professor
rubek
for
me
the
right
thing
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
with
me
maia
rises
and
goes
to
him
yes
there
is
rubek
i
am
sure
you
must
feel
it
yourself
professor
rubek
why
my
dearest
maia
what
should
be
amiss
with
me
maia
behind
him
bending
over
the
back
of
his
chair
that
you
must
tell
me
you
have
begun
to
wander
about
without
a
moment
peace
you
can
not
rest
anywhere
neither
at
home
nor
abroad
you
have
become
quite
misanthropic
of
late
professor
rubek
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
dear
me
have
you
noticed
that
maia
no
one
that
knows
you
can
help
noticing
it
and
then
it
seems
to
me
so
sad
that
you
have
lost
all
pleasure
in
your
work
professor
rubek
that
too
eh
maia
you
that
used
to
be
so
indefatigable
working
from
morning
to
night
professor
rubek
gloomily
used
to
be
yes
maia
but
ever
since
you
got
your
great
masterpiece
out
of
hand
professor
rubek
nods
thoughtfully
the
resurrection
day
maia
the
masterpiece
that
has
gone
round
the
whole
world
and
made
you
so
famous
professor
rubek
perhaps
that
is
just
the
misfortune
maia
maia
how
so
professor
rubek
when
i
had
finished
this
masterpiece
of
mine
makes
a
passionate
movement
with
his
hand
for
the
resurrection
day
is
a
masterpiece
or
was
one
in
the
beginning
no
it
is
one
still
it
must
must
must
be
a
masterpiece
maia
looks
at
him
in
astonishment
why
rubek
all
the
world
knows
that
professor
rubek
short
repellently
all
the
world
knows
nothing
understands
nothing
maia
well
at
any
rate
it
can
divine
something
professor
rubek
something
that
is
there
at
all
yes
something
that
never
was
in
my
mind
ah
yes
that
they
can
all
go
into
ecstasies
over
growling
to
himself
what
is
the
good
of
working
oneself
to
death
for
the
mob
and
the
masses
for
all
the
world
maia
do
you
think
it
is
better
then
do
you
think
it
is
worthy
of
you
to
do
nothing
at
all
but
now
and
then
professor
rubek
with
a
sly
smile
they
are
not
exactly
that
i
turn
out
maia
maia
yes
indeed
they
are
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
ever
since
you
finished
your
great
group
and
got
it
out
of
the
house
professor
rubek
all
the
same
they
are
no
mere
i
assure
you
maia
what
are
they
then
professor
rubek
there
is
something
equivocal
something
cryptic
lurking
in
and
behind
these
busts
a
secret
something
that
the
people
themselves
can
not
see
maia
indeed
professor
rubek
decisively
i
alone
can
see
it
and
it
amuses
me
on
the
surface
i
give
them
the
striking
likeness
as
they
call
it
that
they
all
stand
and
gape
at
in
astonishment
lowers
his
voice
but
at
bottom
they
are
all
respectable
pompous
and
and
and
fatted
and
sometimes
dull
brutal
as
well
maia
indifferently
all
the
dear
domestic
animals
in
fact
professor
rubek
simply
the
dear
domestic
animals
maia
all
the
animals
which
men
have
bedevilled
in
their
own
image
and
which
have
bedevilled
men
in
return
empties
his
and
laughs
and
it
is
these
works
of
art
that
our
excellent
plutocrats
come
and
order
of
me
and
pay
for
in
all
good
faith
and
in
good
round
figures
too
almost
their
weight
in
gold
as
the
saying
goes
maia
fills

hand
several
times
across
his
forehead
and
leans
back
in
his
chair
i
am
happy
maia
really
happy
in
a
way
short
silence
for
after
all
there
is
a
certain
happiness
in
feeling
oneself
free
and
independent
on
every
hand
in
having
at
ones
command
everything
one
can
possibly
wish
for
all
outward
things
that
is
to
say
do
you
not
agree
with
me
maia
maia
oh
yes
i
agree
all
that
is
well
enough
in
its
way
looking
at
him
but
do
you
remember
what
you
promised
me
the
day
we
came
to
an
understanding
on
on
that
troublesome
point
professor
rubek
nods
on
the
subject
of
our
marriage
yes
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
you
maia
maia
continuing
unruffled
and
agreed
that
i
was
to
go
abroad
with
you
and
live
there
for
good
and
all
and
enjoy
do
you
remember
what
you
promised
me
that
day
professor
rubek
shaking
his
head
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
well
what
did
i
promise
maia
you
said
you
would
take
me
up
to
a
high
mountain
and
show
me
all
the
glory
of
the
world
professor
rubek
with
a
slight
start
did
i
promise
you
that
too
maia
me
too
who
else
pray
professor
rubek
indifferently
no
no
i
only
meant
did
i
promise
to
show
you
maia
all
the
glory
of
the
world
yes
you
did
and
all
that
glory
should
be
mine
you
said
professor
rubek
that
is
sort
of
figure
of
speech
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
using
once
upon
a
time
maia
only
a
figure
of
speech
professor
rubek
yes
a
schoolboy
phrase
the
sort
of
thing
i
used
to
say
when
i
wanted
to
lure
the
neighbours
children
out
to
play
with
me
in
the
woods
and
on
the
mountains
maia
looking
hard
at
him
perhaps
you
only
wanted
to
lure
me
out
to
play
as
well
professor
rubek
passing
it
off
as
a
jest
well
has
it
not
been
a
tolerable
amusing
game
maia
maia
coldly
i
did
not
go
with
you
only
to
play
professor
rubek
no
no
i
daresay
not
maia
and
you
never
took
me
up
with
you
to
any
high
mountain
or
showed
me
professor
rubek
with
irritation
all
the
glory
of
the
world
no
i
did
not
for
let
me
tell
you
something
you
are
not
really
born
to
be
a
little
maia
maia
trying
to
control
herself
yet
at
one
time
you
seemed
to
think
i
was
professor
rubek
four
or
five
years
ago
yes
stretching
himself
in
his
chair
four
or
five
years
it
a
long
long
time
maia
maia
looking
at
him
with
a
bitter
expression
has
the
time
seemed
so
very
long
to
you
rubek
professor
rubek
i
am
beginning
now
to
find
it
a
trifle
long
yawning
now
and
then
you
know
maia
returning
to
her
place
i
shall
not
bore
you
any
longer
she
resumes
her
seat
takes
up
the
newspaper
and
begins
turning
over
the
leaves
silence
on
both
sides
professor
rubek
leaning
on
his
elbows
across
the
table
and
looking
at
her
teasingly
is
the
frau
professor
offended
maia
coldly
without
looking
up
no
not
at
all
visitors
to
the
baths
most
of
them
ladies
begin
to
pass
singly
and
in
groups
through
the
park
from
the
right
and
out
to
the
left
waiters
bring
refreshments
from
the
hotel
and
go
off
behind
the
pavilion
the
inspector
wearing
gloves
and
carrying
a
stick
comes
from
his
rounds
in
the
park
meets
visitors
bows
politely
and
exchanges
a
few
words
with
some
of
them
the
inspector
advancing
to
professor
rubek
table
and
politely
taking
off
his
hat
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
good
morning
mrs
good
morning
professor
rubek
professor
rubek
good
morning
good
morning
inspector
the
inspector
addressing
himself
to
mrs
rubek
may
i
venture
to
ask
if
you
have
slept
well
maia
yes
thank
you
excellently
for
my
part
i
always
sleep
like
a
stone
the
inspector
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
the
first
night
in
a
strange
place
is
often
rather
and
the
professor
professor
rubek
oh
my
night
rest
is
never
much
to
boast
of
especially
of
late
the
inspector
with
a
show
of
sympathy
oh
that
is
a
pity
but
after
a
few
stay
at
the
baths
you
will
quite
get
over
that
professor
rubek
looking
up
at
him
tell
me
inspector
are
any
of
your
patients
in
the
habit
of
taking
baths
during
the
night
the
inspector
astonished
during
the
night
no
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
professor
rubek
have
you
not
the
inspector
no
i
do
know
of
any
one
so
ill
as
to
require
such
treatment
professor
rubek
well
at
any
rate
there
is
some
one
who
is
in
the
habit
of
walking
about
the
park
by
night
the
inspector
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
no
professor
that
would
be
against
the
rules
maia
impatiently
good
heavens
rubek
i
told
you
so
this
morning
you
must
have
dreamt
it
professor
rubek
drily
indeed
must
i
thank
you
turning
to
the
inspector
the
fact
is
i
got
up
last
night
i
could
sleep
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
sort
of
night
it
was
the
inspector
attentively
to
be
sure
and
then
professor
rubek
i
looked
out
at
the
window
and
caught
sight
of
a
white
figure
in
there
among
the
trees
maia
smiling
to
the
inspector
and
the
professor
declares
that
the
figure
was
dressed
in
a
bathing
costume
professor
rubek
or
something
like
it
i
said
could
distinguish
very
clearly
but
i
am
sure
it
was
something
white
the
inspector
most
remarkable
was
it
a
gentleman
or
a
lady
professor
rubek
i
could
almost
have
sworn
it
was
a
lady
but
then
after
it
came
another
figure
and
that
one
was
quite
dark
like
a
shadow
the
inspector
starting
a
dark
one
quite
black
perhaps
professor
rubek
yes
i
should
almost
have
said
so
the
inspector
a
light
breaking
in
upon
him
and
behind
the
white
figure
following
close
upon
her
professor
rubek
yes
at
a
little
distance
the
inspector
aha
then
i
think
i
can
explain
the
mystery
professor
professor
rubek
well
what
was
it
then
maia
simultaneously
was
the
professor
really
not
dreaming
the
inspector
suddenly
whispering
as
he
directs
their
attention
towards
the
background
on
the
right
hush
if
you
please
look
there
do
speak
loud
for
a
moment
a
slender
lady
dressed
in
fine
cashmere
and
followed
by
a
sister
of
mercy
in
black
with
a
silver
cross
hanging
by
a
chain
on
her
breast
comes
forward
from
behind
the
hotel
and
crosses
the
park
towards
the
pavilion
in
front
on
the
left
her
face
is
pale
and
its
lines
seem
to
have
stiffened
the
eyelids
are
drooped
and
the
eyes
appear
as
though
they
saw
nothing
her
dress
comes
down
to
her
feet
and
clings
to
the
body
in
perpendicular
folds
over
her
head
neck
breast
shoulders
and
arms
she
wears
a
large
shawl
of
white
crape
she
keeps
her
arms
crossed
upon
her
breast
she
carries
her
body
immovably
and
her
steps
are
stiff
and
measured
the
sister
bearing
is
also
measured
and
she
has
the
air
of
a
servant
she
keeps
her
brown
piercing
eyes
incessantly
fixed
upon
the
lady
waiters
with
napkins
on
their
arms
come
forward
in
the
hotel
doorway
and
cast
curious
glances
at
the
strangers
who
take
no
notice
of
anything
and
without
looking
round
enter
the
pavilion
professor
rubek
has
risen
slowly
and
involuntarily
and
stands
staring
at
the
closed
door
of
the
pavilion
who
was
that
lady
the
inspector
she
is
a
stranger
who
has
rented
the
little
pavilion
there
professor
rubek
a
foreigner
the
inspector
presumably
at
any
rate
they
both
came
from
abroad
about
a
week
ago
they
have
never
been
here
before
professor
rubek
decidedly
looking
at
him
it
was
she
i
saw
in
the
park
last
night
the
inspector
no
doubt
it
must
have
been
i
thought
so
from
the
first
professor
rubek
what
is
this
lady
name
inspector
the
inspector
she
has
registered
herself
as
madame
de
satow
with
companion
we
know
nothing
more
professor
rubek
reflecting
satow
satow
maia
laughing
mockingly
do
you
know
any
one
of
that
name
rubek
eh
professor
rubek
shaking
his
head
no
no
satow
it
sounds
russian
or
in
all
events
slavonic
to
the
inspector
what
language
does
she
speak
the
inspector
when
the
two
ladies
talk
to
each
other
it
is
in
a
language
i
can
not
make
out
at
all
but
at
other
times
she
speaks
norwegian
like
a
native
professor
rubek
exclaims
with
a
start
norwegian
you
are
sure
you
are
not
mistaken
the
inspector
no
how
could
i
be
mistaken
in
that
professor
rubek
looks
at
him
with
eager
interest
you
have
heard
her
yourself
the
inspector
yes
i
myself
have
spoken
to
her
several
only
a
few
words
however
she
is
far
from
communicative
but
professor
rubek
but
norwegian
it
was
the
inspector
thoroughly
good
norwegian
perhaps
with
a
little
accent
professor
rubek
gazing
straight
before
him
in
amazement
whispers
that
too
maia
a
little
hurt
and
jarred
perhaps
this
lady
has
been
one
of
your
models
rubek
search
your
memory
professor
rubek
looks
cuttingly
at
her
my
models
maia
with
a
provoking
smile
in
your
younger
days
i
mean
you
are
said
to
have
had
innumerable
models
long
ago
of
course
professor
rubek
in
the
same
tone
oh
no
little
frau
maia
i
have
in
reality
had
only
one
single
model
one
and
only
one
for
everything
i
have
done
the
inspector
who
has
turned
away
and
stands
looking
out
to
the
left
if
excuse
me
i
think
i
will
take
my
leave
i
see
some
one
coming
whom
it
is
not
particularly
agreeable
to
meet
especially
in
the
presence
of
ladies
professor
rubek
looking
in
the
same
direction
that
sportsman
there
who
is
it
the
inspector
it
is
a
certain
ulfheim
from
professor
rubek
oh
ulfheim
the
inspector
the
as
they
call
him
professor
rubek
i
know
him
the
inspector
who
does
not
know
him
professor
rubek
very
slightly
however
is
he
on
your
list
of
patients
at
last
the
inspector
no
strangely
enough
not
as
yet
he
comes
here
only
once
a
year
on
his
way
up
to
his
excuse
me
for
the
moment
makes
a
movement
to
go
into
the
hotel
ulfheim
voice
heard
outside
stop
a
moment
man
devil
take
it
all
ca
you
stop
why
do
you
always
scuttle
away
from
me
the
inspector
stops
i
am
not
scuttling
at
all
ulfheim
ulfheim
enters
from
the
left
followed
by
a
servant
with
a
couple
of
sporting
dogs
in
leash
ulfheim
is
in
shooting
costume
with
high
boots
and
a
felt
hat
with
a
feather
in
it
he
is
a
long
lank
sinewy
personage
with
matted
hair
and
beard
and
a
loud
voice
his
appearance
gives
no
precise
clue
to
his
age
but
he
is
no
longer
young
ulfheim
pounces
upon
the
inspector
is
this
a
way
to
receive
strangers
hey
you
scamper
away
with
your
tail
between
your
legs
as
if
you
had
the
devil
at
your
heels
the
inspector
calmly
without
answering
him
has
ulfheim
arrived
by
the
steamer
ulfheim
growls
have
had
the
honour
of
seeing
any
steamer
with
his
arms
akimbo
do
you
know
that
i
sail
my
own
cutter
to
the
servant
look
well
after
your
lars
but
take
care
you
keep
them
ravenous
all
the
same
fresh
but
not
too
much
meat
on
them
do
you
hear
and
be
sure
it
reeking
raw
and
bloody
and
get
something
in
your
own
belly
while
you
about
it
aiming
a
kick
at
him
now
then
go
to
hell
with
you
the
servant
goes
out
with
the
dogs
behind
the
corner
of
the
hotel
the
inspector
would
not
ulfheim
like
to
go
into
the
in
the
meantime
ulfheim
in
among
all
the
flies
and
people
no
thank
you
a
thousand
times
mr
inspector
the
inspector
well
well
as
you
please
ulfheim
but
get
the
housekeeper
to
prepare
a
hamper
for
me
as
usual
there
must
be
plenty
of
provender
in
it
and
lots
of
brandy
you
can
tell
her
that
i
or
lars
will
come
and
play
old
harry
with
her
if
she
does
the
inspector
interrupting
we
know
your
ways
of
old
turning
can
i
give
the
waiter
any
orders
professor
can
i
send
rubek
anything
professor
rubek
no
thank
you
nothing
for
me
maia
nor
for
me
the
inspector
goes
into
the
hotel
ulfheim
stares
at
them
for
a
moment
then
lifts
his
hat
why
blast
me
if
here
is
a
country
tyke
that
has
strayed
into
regular
society
professor
rubek
looking
up
what
do
you
mean
by
that
ulfheim
ulfheim
more
quietly
and
politely
i
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
no
less
a
person
than
the
great
sculptor
rubek
professor
rubek
nods
i
remember
meeting
you
once
or
twice
the
autumn
when
i
was
last
at
home
ulfheim
that
many
years
ago
now
and
then
you
were
so
illustrious
as
i
hear
you
since
become
at
that
time
even
a
dirty
might
venture
to
come
near
you
professor
rubek
smiling
i
do
bite
even
now
maia
looks
with
interest
at
ulfheim
are
you
really
and
truly
a
ulfheim
seating
himself
at
the
next
table
nearer
the
hotel
a
when
i
have
the
chance
madam
but
i
make
the
best
of
any
sort
of
game
that
comes
in
my
way
eagles
and
wolves
and
women
and
elks
and
reindeer
if
only
it
fresh
and
juicy
and
has
plenty
of
blood
in
it
drinks
from
his
maia
regarding
him
fixedly
but
you
like
best
ulfheim
i
like
it
best
yes
for
then
one
can
have
the
knife
handy
at
a
pinch
with
a
slight
smile
we
both
work
in
a
hard
material
madam
both
your
husband
and
i
he
struggles
with
his
marble
blocks
i
daresay
and
i
struggle
with
tense
and
quivering
and
we
both
of
us
win
the
fight
in
the
end
subdue
and
master
our
material
we
never
rest
till
we
got
the
upper
hand
of
it
though
it
fight
never
so
hard
professor
rubek
deep
in
thought
there
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
ulfheim
yes
for
i
take
it
the
stone
has
something
to
fight
for
too
it
is
dead
and
determined
by
no
manner
of
means
to
let
itself
be
hammered
into
life
just
like
the
bear
when
you
come
and
prod
him
up
in
his
lair
maia
are
you
going
up
into
the
forests
now
to
hunt
ulfheim
i
am
going
right
up
into
the
high
i
suppose
you
have
never
been
in
the
high
mountain
madam
maia
no
never
ulfheim
confound
it
all
then
you
must
be
sure
and
come
up
there
this
very
summer
i
take
you
with
me
both
you
and
the
professor
with
pleasure
maia
thanks
but
rubek
is
thinking
of
taking
a
sea
trip
this
summer
professor
rubek
round
the
coast
through
the
island
channels
ulfheim
ugh
what
the
devil
would
you
do
in
those
damnable
sickly
gutters
floundering
about
in
the
brackish
ditchwater
dishwater
i
should
rather
call
it
maia
there
you
hear
rubek
ulfheim
no
much
better
come
up
with
me
to
the
mountain
away
clean
away
from
the
trail
and
taint
of
men
you
cant
think
what
that
means
for
me
but
such
a
little
lady
he
stops
the
sister
of
mercy
comes
out
of
the
pavilion
and
goes
into
the
hotel
ulfheim
following
her
with
his
eyes
just
look
at
her
do
that
there
who
is
it
that
to
be
buried
professor
rubek
i
have
not
heard
of
any
one
ulfheim
well
there
some
one
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
ghost
then
in
on
corner
or
people
that
are
sickly
and
rickety
should
have
the
goodness
to
see
about
getting

when

of

turns
sick
and
miserable
bang
and
there
my
friend
sent
packing
to
the
other
world
the
sister
of
mercy
comes
out
of
the
hotel
with
a
tray
on
which
is
bread
and
milk
she
places
it
on
the
table
outside
the
pavilion
which
she
enters
ulfheim
laughs
scornfully
that
stuff
there
is
that
what
you
call
food
for
human
beings
milk
and
water
and
soft
clammy
bread
ah

comrades
feeding

maia

across
to
the
professor
and

much
ulfheim
also
rising
spoken
like
a
woman
of
spirit
madam
come
with
me
then
they
swallow
whole
great
thumping
gulp
them
up
and
then
gulp
them
down
again
oh

a
regular
treat
to
see
them
come
along
and
i
show
you
and
while
we
about
it
we
can
talk
over
this
trip
to
the
mountains
he
goes
out
by
the
corner
of
the
hotel
maia
following
him
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
strange
lady
comes
out
of
the
pavilion
and
seats
herself
at
the
table
the
lady
raises
her
glass
of
milk
and
is
about
to
drink
but
stops
and
looks
across
at
rubek
with
vacant
expressionless
eyes
professor
rubek
remains
sitting
at
his
table
and
gazes
fixedly
and
earnestly
at
her
at
last
he
rises
goes
some
steps
towards
her
stops
and
says
in
a
low
voice
i
know
you

well

the
lady
in
a
toneless
voice
setting
down
her
glass
you

guess

professor
rubek
without
answering
and
you
recognise
me
too

rubek
with
me
how

the
lady

rubek
not

the
lady
after
a
short
pause
who

the
other
the
woman

had
with
you
there
at
the
table
professor
rubek
a
little
reluctantly
she
that

lady
nods
slowly

rubek
nods

recollection

shakes
his

reproachfully

not
the
heart
to
do
it
irene

innumerable
times
by
daylight
and
in
the
dark

it
in
hatred
and
in
revenge
and
in
anguish
professor
rubek
goes
close
up
to
the
table
and
asks
softly

last
after
all
these
years
why

vanished
away

went
into
the
darkness
when

in
the
light
professor
rubek
have

more
than
i
could
do
with
you

more
than

could
do
with
you
arnold

inexorably
it
was
great
sport
i
can
tell
you
while

have
laughed
within

all
the
time

professor
rubek
and
where

he
now
irene

long
long
before

sadly
and
earnestly
there
is
something
hidden
behind
everything

how
can
i
help
that
every
word
i

is
whispered
into
my
ear
professor
rubek

divine
your
meaning

ought
to
be
the
only
one

rubek
rests
his
hands
on

table
and
looks
intently
at
her

of
the
strings
of
your
nature

broken

always
happen
when
a
young
woman

rises
slowly
from
her
chair
and
says
quivering
i
was
dead
for
many
years
they
came
and
bound
me
laced
my
arms
together
behind
my
back
then
they
lowered
me
into
a
with
iron
bars
before
the
and
with
padded
walls
so
that
no
one
on
the
earth
above
could
hear
the
but
now
i
am
beginning
in
a
way
to
rise
from
the
dead
she
seats
herself
again
professor
rubek
after
a
pause
in
all
this
do
you
hold
me
guilty
irene
yes
professor
rubek
guilty
of
that
your
death
as
you
call
it
irene
guilty
of
the
fact
that
i
had
to
die
changing
her
tone
to
one
of
indifference
why
do
you
sit
down
arnold
professor
rubek
may
i
irene
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
frozen
i
do
think
i
am
quite
turned
to
ice
yet
professor
rubek
moves
a
chair
and
seats
himself
at
her
table
there
irene
now
we
two
are
sitting
together
as
in
the
old
days
irene
a
little
way
apart
from
each
other
also
as
in
the
old
days
professor
rubek
moving
nearer
it
had
to
be
so
then
irene
had
it
professor
rubek
decisively
there
had
to
be
a
distance
between
us
irene
was
it
absolutely
necessary
arnold
professor
rubek
continuing
do
you
remember
what
you
answered
when
i
asked
if
you
would
go
with
me
out
into
the
wide
world
irene
i
held
up
three
fingers
in
the
air
and
swore
that
i
would
go
with
you
to
the
world
end
and
to
the
end
of
life
and
that
i
would
serve
you
in
all
things
professor
rubek
as
the
model
for
my
art
irene
in
frank
utter
nakedness
professor
rubek
with
emotion
and
you
did
serve
me
irene
so
bravely
so
gladly
and
ungrudgingly
irene
yes
with
all
the
pulsing
blood
of
my
youth
i
served
you
professor
rubek
nodding
with
a
look
of
gratitude
that
you
have
every
right
to
say
irene
i
fell
down
at
your
feet
and
served
you
arnold
holding
her
clenched
hand
towards
him
but
you
you
you
professor
rubek
defensively
i
never
did
you
any
wrong
never
irene
irene
yes
you
did
you
did
wrong
to
my
innermost
inborn
nature
professor
rubek
starting
back
i
irene
yes
you
i
exposed
myself
wholly
and
unreservedly
to
your
gaze
more
softly
and
never
once
did
you
touch
me
professor
rubek
irene
did
you
not
understand
that
many
a
time
i
was
almost
beside
myself
under
the
spell
of
all
your
loveliness
irene
continuing
undisturbed
and
yet
if
you
had
touched
me
i
think
i
should
have
killed
you
on
the
spot
for
i
had
a
sharp
needle
always
upon
me
hidden
in
my
hair
strokes
her
forehead
meditatively
but
after
all
after
all
that
you
could
professor
rubek
looks
impressively
at
her
i
was
an
artist
irene
irene
darkly
that
is
just
it
that
is
just
it
professor
rubek
an
artist
first
of
all
and
i
was
sick
with
the
desire
to
achieve
the
great
work
of
my
life
losing
himself
in
recollection
it
was
to
be
called
the
resurrection
day
figured
in
the
likeness
of
a
young
woman
awakening
from
the
sleep
of
death
irene
our
child
yes
professor
rubek
continuing
it
was
to
be
the
awakening
of
the
noblest
purest
most
ideal
woman
the
world
ever
saw
then
i
found
you
you
were
what
i
required
in
every
respect
and
you
consented
so
willingly
so
gladly
you
renounced
home
and
kindred
and
went
with
me
irene
to
go
with
you
meant
for
me
the
resurrection
of
my
childhood
professor
rubek
that
was
just
why
i
found
in
you
all
that
i
required
in
you
and
in
no
one
else
i
came
to
look
on
you
as
a
thing
hallowed
not
to
be
touched
save
in
adoring
thoughts
in
those
days
i
was
still
young
irene
and
the
superstition
took
hold
of
me
that
if
i
touched
you
if
i
desired
you
with
my
senses
my
soul
would
be
profaned
so
that
i
should
be
unable
to
accomplish
what
i
was
striving
and
i
still
think
there
was
some
truth
in
that
irene
nods
with
a
touch
of
scorn
the
work
of
art
first
then
the
human
being
professor
rubek
you
must
judge
me
as
you
will
but
at
that
time
i
was
utterly
dominated
by
my
great
task
and
exultantly
happy
in
it
irene
and
you
achieved
your
great
task
arnold
professor
rubek
thanks
and
praise
be
to
you
i
achieved
my
great
task
i
wanted
to
embody
the
pure
woman
as
i
saw
her
awakening
on
the
resurrection
day
not
marvelling
at
anything
new
and
unknown
and
undivined
but
filled
with
a
sacred
joy
at
finding
herself
unchanged
she
the
woman
of
earth
in
the
higher
freer
happier
region
after
the
long
dreamless
sleep
of
death
more
softly
thus
did
i
fashion
i
fashioned
her
in
your
image
irene
irene
laying
her
hands
flat
upon
the
table
and
leaning
against
the
back
of
her
chair
and
then
you
were
done
with
me
professor
rubek
reproachfully
irene
irene
you
had
no
longer
any
use
for
me
professor
rubek
how
can
you
say
that
irene
and
began
to
look
about
you
for
other
ideals
professor
rubek
i
found
none
none
after
you
irene
and
no
other
models
arnold
professor
rubek
you
were
no
model
to
me
you
were
the
fountainhead
of
my
achievement
irene
is
silent
for
a
short
time
what
poems
have
you
made
since
in
marble
i
mean
since
the
day
i
left
you
professor
rubek
i
have
made
no
poems
since
that
day
only
frittered
away
my
life
in
modelling
irene
and
that
woman
whom
you
are
now
living
with
professor
rubek
interrupting
vehemently
do
not
speak
of
her
now
it
makes
me
tingle
with
shame
irene
where
are
you
thinking
of
going
with
her
professor
rubek
slack
and
weary
oh
on
a
tedious
to
the
north
i
suppose
irene
looks
at
him
smiles
almost
imperceptibly
and
whispers
you
should
rather
go
high
up
into
the
mountains
as
high
as
ever
you
can
higher
higher
always
higher
arnold
professor
rubek
with
eager
expectation
are
you
going
up
there
irene
have
you
the
courage
to
meet
me
once
again
professor
rubek
struggling
with
himself
uncertainly
if
we
could
oh
if
only
we
could
irene
why
can
we
not
do
what
we
will
looks
at
him
and
whispers
beseechingly
with
folded
hands
come
come
arnold
oh
come
up
to
me
maia

glowing
with
pleasure
from
behind
the
hotel
and
goes
quickly
up
to
the
table
where
they
were
previously
sitting
maia
still
at
the
corner
of
the
hotel
without
looking
around
oh

may
say
what
you
please
rubek
but
stops
as
she
catches
sight
of
irene

beg
your
pardon

made
an
acquaintance

renewed
an
acquaintance

wanted
with
me

to
say

the
marvelous
things

has
to
tell
about
the
mountains

about
life
up
there
they
ugly
horrid
repulsive
most
of
the
yarns
he
spins
for
i
almost
believe
he
lying
but
wonderfully
alluring

the
same
oh

rubek
professor

the
slightest
objection

the
mountains

long

same
way

maia
quickly

my
account

rubek

the
mountains

my
mind

once

rubek

repels
the
movement
oh

dear
and
good
you
are
rubek
she
runs
into
the
hotel
at
the
same
time
the
door
of
the
pavilion
is
softly
and
noiselessly
set
ajar
the
sister
of
mercy
stands
in
the
opening
intently
on
the
watch
no
one
sees
her
professor
rubek
decidedly
turning
to
irene
shall
we
meet
up
there
then
irene
rising
slowly
yes
we
shall
certainly
i
have
sought
for
you
so
long
professor
rubek
when
did
you
begin
to
seek
for
me
irene
irene
with
a
touch
of
jesting
bitterness
from
the
moment
i
realised
that
i
had
given
away
to
you
something
rather
indispensable
arnold
something
one
ought
never
to
part
with
professor
rubek
bowing
his
head
yes
that
is
bitterly
true
you
gave
me
three
or
four
years
of
your
youth
irene
more
more
than
that
i
gave
you
as
i
then
was
professor
rubek
yes
you
were
prodigal
irene
you
gave
me
all
your
naked
loveliness
irene
to
gaze
upon
professor
rubek
and
to
glorify
irene
yes
for
your
own
and
the
child
professor
rubek
and
yours
too
irene
irene
but
you
have
forgotten
the
most
precious
gift
professor
rubek
the
most
precious
what
gift
was
that
irene
i
gave
you
my
young
living
soul
and
that
gift
left
me
empty
within
soulless
looking
at
him
with
a
fixed
stare
it
was
that
i
died
of
arnold
the
sister
of
mercy
opens
the
door
wide
and
makes
room
for
her
she
goes
into
the
pavilion
professor
rubek
stands
and
looks
after
her
then
whispers
irene
act
second
near
a
mountain
resort
the
landscape
stretches
in
the
form
of
an
immense
treeless
upland
towards
a
long
mountain
lake
beyond
the
lake
rises
a
range
of
peaks
with
snow
in
the
clefts
in
the
foreground
on
the
left
a
purling
brook
falls
in
severed
streamlets
down
a
steep
wall
of
rock
and
thence
flows
smoothly
over
the
upland
until
it
disappears
to
the
right
dwarf
trees
plants
and
stones
along
the
course
of
the
brook
in
the
foreground
on
the
right
a
hillock
with
a
stone
bench
on
the
top
of
it
it
is
a
summer
afternoon
towards
sunset
at
some
distance
over
the
upland
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
a
troop
of
children
is
singing
dancing
and
playing
some
are
dressed
in
peasant
costume
others
in
clothes
their
happy
laughter
is
heard
softened
by
distance
during
the
following
professor
rubek
is
sitting
on
the
bench
with
a
plaid
over
his
shoulders
and
looking
down
at
the
children
play
presently
maia
comes
forward
from
among
some
bushes
on
the
upland
to
the
left
well
back
and
scans
the
prospect
with
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
she
wears
a
flat
tourist
cap
a
short
skirt
kilted
up
reaching
only
midway
between
ankle
and
knee
and
high
stout
she
has
in
her
hand
a
long
alpenstock
maia
at
last
catches
sight
of
rubek
and
calls
hallo
she
advances
over
the
upland
jumps
over
the
brook
with
the
aid
of
her
alpenstock
and
climbs
up
the
hillock
maia
panting
oh
how
i
have
been
rushing
around
looking
for
you
rubek
professor
rubek
nods
indifferently
and
asks
have
you
just
come
from
the
hotel
maia
yes
that
was
the
last
place
i
tried
that
professor
rubek
looking
at
her
for
moment
i
noticed
that
you
were
not
at
the
maia
no
we
had
our
dinner
in
the
open
air
we
two
professor
rubek
we
two
what
two
maia
why
i
and
that
horrid
of
course
professor
rubek
oh
he
maia
yes
and
first
thing
morning
we
are
going
off
again
professor
rubek
after
bears
maia
yes
off
to
kill
a
professor
rubek
have
you
found
the
tracks
of
any
maia
with
superiority
you
do
suppose
that
bears
are
to
be
found
in
the
naked
mountains
do
you
professor
rubek
where
then
maia
far
beneath
on
the
lower
slopes
in
the
thickest
parts
of
the
forest
places
your
ordinary
could
never
get
through
professor
rubek
and
you
two
are
going
down
there
maia
throwing
herself
down
among
the
heather
yes
so
we
have
or
perhaps
we
may
start
this
if
you
have
no
objection
that
to
say
professor
rubek
i
far
be
it
from
me
to
maia
quickly
of
course
lars
goes
with
us
with
the
dogs
professor
rubek
i
feel
no
curiosity
as
to
the
movements
of
lars
and
his
dogs
changing
the
subject
would
you
not
rather
sit
properly
on
the
seat
maia
drowsily
no
thank
you
i
lying
so
delightfully
in
the
soft
heather
professor
rubek
i
can
see
that
you
are
tired
maia
yawning
i
almost
think
i
beginning
to
feel
tired
professor
rubek
you
do
notice
it
till
afterwards
when
the
excitement
is
over
maia
in
a
drowsy
tone
just
so
i
will
lie
and
close
my
eyes
a
short
pause
maia
with
sudden
impatience
ugh
rubek
how
can
you
endure
to
sit
there
listening
to
these
children
screams
and
to
watch
all
the
capers
they
are
cutting
too
professor
rubek
there
is
something
harmonious
almost
like
music
in
their
movements
now
and
then
amid
all
the
clumsiness
and
it
amuses
me
to
sit
and
watch
for
these
isolated
moments
when
they
come
maia
with
a
somewhat
scornful
laugh
yes
you
are
always
always
an
artist
professor
rubek
and
i
propose
to
remain
one
maia
lying
on
her
side
so
that
her
back
is
turned
to
him
there
not
a
bit
of
the
artist
about
him
professor
rubek
with
attention
who
is
it
that
not
an
artist
maia
again
in
a
sleepy
tone
why
he
the
other
one
of
course
professor
rubek
the
you
mean
maia
yes
there
not
a
bit
of
the
artist
about
him
not
the
least
little
bit
professor
rubek
smiling
no
i
believe
there
no
doubt
about
that
maia
vehemently
without
moving
and
so
ugly
as
he
is
plucks
up
a
tuft
of
heather
and
throws
it
away
so
ugly
so
ugly
isch
professor
rubek
is
that
why
you
are
so
ready
to
set
off
with
him
out
into
the
wilds
maia
curtly
i
do
know
turning
towards
him
you
are
ugly
too
rubek
professor
rubek
have
you
only
just
discovered
it
maia
no
i
have
seen
it
for
long
professor
rubek
shrugging
his
shoulders
one
does
grow
younger
one
does
grow
younger
frau
maia
maia
it
not
that
sort
of
ugliness
that
i
mean
at
all
but
there
has
come
to
be
such
an
expression
of
fatigue
of
utter
weariness
in
your
eyes
when
you
deign
once
in
a
while
to
cast
a
glance
at
me
professor
rubek
have
you
noticed
that
maia
nods
little
by
little
this
evil
look
has
come
into
your
eyes
it
seems
almost
as
though
you
were
nursing
some
dark
plot
against
me
professor
rubek
indeed
in
a
friendly
but
earnest
tone
come
here
and
sit
beside
me
maia
and
let
us
talk
a
little
maia
half
rising
then
will
you
let
me
sit
upon
your
knee
as
i
used
to
in
the
early
days
professor
rubek
no
you
must
people
can
see
us
from
the
hotel
moves
a
little
but
you
can
sit
here
on
the
bench
at
my
side
maia
no
thank
you
in
that
case
i
rather
lie
here
where
i
am
i
can
hear
you
quite
well
here
looks
inquiringly
at
him
well
what
is
it
you
want
to
say
to
me
professor
rubek
begins
slowly
what
do
you
think
was
my
real
reason
for
agreeing
to
make
this
tour
maia
well
i
remember
you
declared
among
other
things
that
it
was
going
to
do
me
such
a
tremendous
lot
of
good
but
but
professor
rubek
but
maia
but
now
i
do
believe
the
least
little
bit
that
that
was
the
reason
professor
rubek
then
what
is
your
theory
about
it
now
maia
i
think
now
that
it
was
on
account
of
that
pale
lady
professor
rubek
madame
von
satow
maia
yes
she
who
is
always
hanging
at
our
heels
yesterday
evening
she
made
her
appearance
up
here
too
professor
rubek
but
what
in
all
the
world
maia
oh
i
know
you
knew
her
very
well
indeed
long
before
you
knew
me
professor
rubek
and
had
forgotten
her
too
long
before
i
knew
you
maia
sitting
upright
can
you
forget
so
easily
rubek
professor
rubek
curtly
yes
very
easily
indeed
adds
harshly
when
i
want
to
forget
maia
even
a
woman
who
has
been
a
model
to
you
professor
rubek
when
i
have
no
more
use
for
her
maia
one
who
has
stood
to
you
undressed
professor
rubek
that
means
nothing
nothing
for
us
artists
with
a
change
of
tone
and
then
may
i
venture
to
ask
how
was
i
to
guess
that
she
was
in
this
country
maia
oh
you
might
have
seen
her
name
in
a
visitor
list
in
one
of
the
newspapers
professor
rubek
but
i
had
no
idea
of
the
name
she
now
goes
by
i
had
never
heard
of
any
herr
von
satow
maia
affecting
weariness
oh
well
then
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
for
some
other
reason
that
you
were
so
set
upon
this
journey
professor
rubek
seriously
yes
maia
it
was
for
another
reason
a
quite
different
reason
and
that
is
what
we
must
sooner
or
later
have
a
clear
explanation
about
maia
in
a
fit
of
suppressed
laughter
heavens
how
solemn
you
look
professor
rubek
suspiciously
scrutinising
her
yes
perhaps
a
little
more
solemn
than
necessary
maia
how
so
professor
rubek
and
that
is
a
very
good
thing
for
us
both
maia
you
begin
to
make
me
feel
curious
rubek
professor
rubek
only
curious
not
a
little
bit
uneasy
maia
shaking
her
head
not
in
the
least
professor
rubek
good
then
you
said
that
day
down
at
the
baths
that
it
seemed
to
you
i
had
become
very
nervous
of
late
maia
yes
and
you
really
have
professor
rubek
and
what
do
you
think
can
be
the
reason
of
that
maia
how
can
i
tell
quickly
perhaps
you
have
grown
weary
of
this
constant
companionship
with
me
professor
rubek
constant
why
not
say
everlasting
maia
daily
companionship
then
here
have
we
two
solitary
people
lived
down
there
for
four
or
five
mortal
years
and
scarcely
have
an
hour
away
from
each
we
two
all
by
ourselves
professor
rubek
with
interest
well
and
then
maia
a
little
oppressed
you
are
not
a
particularly
sociable
man
rubek
you
like
to
keep
to
yourself
and
think
your
own
thoughts
and
of
course
i
ca
talk
properly
to
you
about
your
affairs
i
know
nothing
about
art
and
that
sort
of
thing
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
care
very
little
either
for
that
matter
professor
rubek
well
well
and
that
why
we
generally
sit
by
the
fireside
and
chat
about
your
affairs
maia
oh
good
gracious
i
have
no
affairs
to
chat
about
professor
rubek
well
they
are
trifles
perhaps
but
at
any
rate
the
time
passes
for
us
in
that
way
as
well
as
another
maia
maia
yes
you
are
right
time
passes
it
is
passing
away
from
you
and
i
suppose
it
is
really
that
that
makes
you
so
uneasy
professor
rubek
nods
vehemently
and
so
restless
writhing
in
his
seat
no
i
shall
soon
not
be
able
to
endure
this
pitiful
life
any
longer
maia
rises
and
stands
for
a
moment
looking
at
him
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
you
have
only
to
say
so
professor
rubek
why
will
you
use
such
phrases
get
rid
of
you
maia
yes
if
you
want
to
have
done
with
me
please
say
so
right
out
and
i
will
go
that
instant
professor
rubek
with
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
do
you
intend
that
as
a
threat
maia
maia
there
can
be
no
threat
for
you
in
what
i
said
professor
rubek
rising
no
i
confess
you
are
right
there
adds
after
a
pause
you
and
i
can
not
possibly
go
on
living
together
like
this
maia
well
and
then
professor
rubek
there
is
no
then
about
it
with
emphasis
on
his
words
because
we
two
can
not
go
on
living
together
alone
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
must
part
maia
smiles
scornfully
only
draw
away
from
each
other
a
little
you
mean
professor
rubek
shakes
his
head
even
that
is
not
necessary
maia
well
then
come
out
with
what
you
want
to
do
with
me
professor
rubek
with
some
hesitation
what
i
now
feel
so
keenly
and
so
painfully
that
i
require
is
to
have
some
one
about
me
who
really
and
truly
stands
close
to
me
maia
interrupts
him
anxiously
do
i
do
that
rubek
professor
rubek
waving
her
aside
not
in
that
sense
what
i
need
is
the
companionship
of
another
person
who
can
as
it
were
complete
me
supply
what
is
wanting
in
me
be
one
with
me
in
all
my
striving
maia
slowly
it
true
that
things
like
that
are
a
great
deal
too
hard
for
me
professor
rubek
oh
no
they
are
not
at
all
in
your
line
maia
maia
with
an
outburst
and
heaven
knows
i
do
want
them
to
be
either
professor
rubek
i
know
that
very
and
it
was
with
no
idea
of
finding
any
such
help
in
my
that
i
married
you
maia
observing
him
closely
i
can
see
in
your
face
that
you
are
thinking
of
some
one
else
professor
rubek
indeed
i
have
never
noticed
before
that
you
were
a
but
you
can
see
that
can
you
maia
yes
i
can
oh
i
know
you
so
well
so
well
rubek
professor
rubek
then
perhaps
you
can
also
see
who
it
is
i
am
thinking
of
maia
yes
indeed
i
can
professor
rubek
well
have
the
goodness
to
maia
you
are
thinking
of
that
that
model
you
once
used
for
suddenly
letting
slip
the
train
of
thought
do
you
know
the
people
down
at
the
hotel
think
she
mad
professor
rubek
indeed
and
pray
what
do
the
people
down
at
the
hotel
think
of
you
and
the
maia
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
continuing
the
former
train
of
thought
but
it
was
this
pale
lady
you
were
thinking
of
professor
rubek
calmly
precisely
of
when
i
had
no
more
use
for
her
and
when
besides
she
went
away
from
me
vanished
without
a
word
maia
then
you
accepted
me
as
a
sort
of
makeshift
i
suppose
professor
rubek
more
unfeelingly
something
of
the
sort
to
tell
the
truth
little
maia
for
a
year
or
a
year
and
a
half
i
had
lived
there
lonely
and
brooding
and
had
put
the
last
touch
the
very
last
touch
to
my
work
the
resurrection
day
went
out
over
the
world
and
brought
me
fame
and
everything
else
that
heart
could
desire
with
greater
warmth
but
i
no
longer
loved
my
own
work
men
laurels
and
incense
nauseated
me
till
i
could
have
rushed
away
in
despair
and
hidden
myself
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
looking
at
her
you
who
are
a
can
you
guess
what
then
occurred
to
me
maia
lightly
yes
it
occurred
to
you
to
make
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
professor
rubek
nods
to
order
yes
with
animals
faces
behind
the
masks
those
i
threw
in
gratis
into
the
bargain
you
understand
smiling
but
that
was
not
precisely
what
i
had
in
my
mind
maia
what
then
professor
rubek
again
serious
it
was
this
that
all
the
talk
about
the
vocation
and
the
artist
mission
and
so
forth
began
to
strike
me
as
being
very
empty
and
hollow
and
meaningless
at
bottom
maia
then
what
would
you
put
in
its
place
professor
rubek
life
maia
maia
life
professor
rubek
yes
is
not
life
in
sunshine
and
in
beauty
a
hundred
times
better
worth
while
than
to
hang
about
to
the
end
of
your
days
in
a
raw
damp
hole
and
wear
yourself
out
in
a
perpetual
struggle
with
lumps
of
clay
and
blocks
of
stone
maia
with
a
little
sigh
yes
i
have
always
thought
so
certainly
professor
rubek
and
then
i
had
become
rich
enough
to
live
in
luxury
and
in
indolent
quivering
sunshine
i
was
able
to
build
myself
the
villa
on
the
lake
of
taunitz
and
the
palazzo
in
the
capital
and
all
the
rest
of
it
maia
taking
up
his
tone
and
last
but
not
least
you
could
afford
to
treat
yourself
to
me
too
and
you
gave
me
leave
to
share
in
all
your
treasures
professor
rubek
jesting
so
as
to
turn
the
conversation
did
i
not
promise
to
take
you
up
to
a
high
enough
mountain
and
show
you
all
the
glory
of
the
world
maia
with
a
gentle
expression
you
have
perhaps
taken
me
up
with
you
to
a
high
enough
mountain
rubek
but
you
have
not
shown
me
all
the
glory
of
the
world
professor
rubek
with
a
laugh
of
irritation
how
insatiable
you
are
absolutely
insatiable
with
a
vehement
outburst
but
do
you
know
what
is
the
most
hopeless
thing
of
all
maia
can
you
guess
that
maia
with
quiet
defiance
yes
i
suppose
it
is
that
you
have
gone
and
tied
yourself
to
me
for
life
professor
rubek
i
would
not
have
expressed
myself
so
heartlessly
maia
but
you
would
have
meant
it
just
as
heartlessly
professor
rubek
you
have
no
clear
idea
of
the
inner
workings
of
an
artist
nature
maia
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
good
heavens
i
have
even
a
clear
idea
of
the
inner
workings
of
my
own
nature
professor
rubek
continuing
undisturbed
i
live
at
such
high
speed
maia
we
live
so
we
artists
i
for
my
part
have
lived
through
a
whole
lifetime
in
the
few
years
we
two
have
known
each
other
i
have
come
to
realise
that
i
am
not
at
all
adapted
for
seeking
happiness
in
indolent
enjoyment
life
does
not
shape
itself
that
way
for
me
and
those
like
me
i
must
go
on
working
producing
one
work
after
another
right
up
to
my
dying
day
forcing
himself
to
continue
that
is
why
i
can
not
get
on
with
you
any
longer
maia
not
with
you
alone
maia
quietly
does
that
mean
in
plain
language
that
you
have
grown
tired
of
me
professor
rubek
bursts
forth
yes
that
is
what
it
means
i
have
grown
tired
intolerably
tired
and
fretted
and
unstrung
in
this
life
with
you
now
you
know
it
controlling
himself
these
are
hard
ugly
words
i
am
using
i
know
that
very
well
and
you
are
not
at
all
to
blame
in
this
matter
that
i
willingly
admit
it
is
simply
and
solely
i
myself
who
have
once
more
undergone
a
revolution
half
to
himself
and
awakening
to
my
real
life
maia
involuntarily
folding
her
hands
why
in
all
the
world
should
we
not
part
then
professor
rubek
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
should
you
be
willing
to
maia
shrugging
her
shoulders
oh
yes
if
there
nothing
else
for
it
then
professor
rubek
eagerly
but
there
is
something
else
for
it
there
is
an
alternative
maia
holding
up
her
forefinger
now
you
are
thinking
of
the
pale
lady
again
professor
rubek
yes
to
tell
the
truth
i
can
not
help
constantly
thinking
of
her
ever
since
i
met
her
again
a
step
nearer
her
for
now
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
maia
maia
well
professor
rubek
touching
his
own
breast
in
here
you
see
in
here
i
have
a
little
casket
and
in
that
casket
all
my
sculptor
visions
are
stored
up
but
when
she
disappeared
and
left
no
trace
the
lock
of
the
casket
snapped
to
and
she
had
the
key
and
she
took
it
away
with
you
little
maia
you
had
no
key
so
all
that
the
casket
contains
must
lie
unused
and
the
years
pass
and
i
have
no
means
of
getting
at
the
treasure
maia
trying
to
repress
a
subtle
smile
then
get
her
to
open
the
casket
for
you
again
professor
rubek
not
understanding
maia
maia
for
here
she
is
you
see
and
no
doubt
it
on
account
of
this
casket
that
she
has
come
professor
rubek
i
have
not
said
a
single
word
to
her
on
this
subject
maia
looks
innocently
at
him
my
dear
rubek
is
it
worth
while
to
make
all
this
fuss
and
commotion
about
so
simple
a
matter
professor
rubek
do
you
think
this
matter
is
so
absolutely
simple
maia
yes
certainly
i
think
so
do
you
attach
yourself
to
whoever
you
most
require
nods
to
him
i
shall
always
manage
to
find
a
place
for
myself
professor
rubek
where
do
you
mean
maia
unconcerned
evasively
well
i
need
only
take
myself
off
to
the
villa
if
it
should
be
necessary
but
it
wo
be
for
in
town
in
all
that
great
house
of
ours
there
must
surely
with
a
little
good
will
be
room
enough
for
three
professor
rubek
uncertainly
and
do
you
think
that
would
work
in
the
long
run
maia
in
a
light
tone
very
well
then
if
it
wo
work
it
wo
it
is
no
good
talking
about
it
professor
rubek
and
what
shall
we
do
then
maia
if
it
does
not
work
maia
untroubled
then
we
two
will
simply
get
out
of
each
other
way
part
entirely
i
shall
always
find
something
new
for
myself
somewhere
in
the
world
something
free
free
free
no
need
to
be
anxious
about
that
professor
rubek
suddenly
points
off
to
the
right
look
there
there
we
have
her
professor
rubek
turning
where
maia
out
on
the
plain
striding
like
a
marble
stature
she
is
coming
this
way
professor
rubek
stands
gazing
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
does
not
she
look
like
the
resurrection
incarnate
to
himself
and
her
i
could
displace
and
move
into
the
shade
remodel
her
fool
that
i
was
maia
what
do
you
mean
by
that
professor
rubek
putting
the
question
aside
nothing
nothing
that
you
would
understand
irene
advances
from
the
right
over
the
upland
the
children
at
their
play
have
already
caught
sight
of
her
and
run
to
meet
her
she
is
now
surrounded
by
them
some
appear
confident
and
at
ease
others
uneasy
and
timid
she
talks
low
to
them
and
indicates
that
they
are
to
go
down
to
the
hotel
she
herself
will
rest
a
little
beside
the
brook
the
children
run
down
over
the
slope
to
the
left
half
way
to
the
back
irene
goes
up
to
the
wall
of
rock
and
lets
the
rillets
of
the
cascade
flow
over
her
hands
cooling
them
maia
in
a
low
voice
go
down
and
speak
to
her
alone
rubek
professor
rubek
and
where
will
you
go
in
the
meantime
maia
looking
significantly
at
him
henceforth
i
shall
go
my
own
ways
she
descends
form
the
hillock
and
leaps
over
the
brook
by
aid
of
her
alpenstock
she
stops
beside
irene
maia
professor
rubek
is
up
there
waiting
for
you
madam
irene
what
does
he
want
maia
he
wants
you
to
help
him
to
open
a
casket
that
has
snapped
to
irene
can
i
help
him
in
that
maia
he
says
you
are
the
only
person
that
can
irene
then
i
must
try
maia
yes
you
really
must
madam
she
goes
down
by
the
path
to
the
hotel
in
a
little
while
professor
rubek
comes
down
to
irene
but
stops
with
the
brook
between
them
irene
after
a
short
pause
she
the
other
one
said
that
you
had
been
waiting
for
me
professor
rubek
i
have
waited
for
you
year
after
year
without
myself
knowing
it
irene
i
could
not
come
to
you
arnold
i
was
lying
down
there
sleeping
the
long
deep
dreamful
sleep
professor
rubek
but
now
you
have
awakened
irene
irene
shakes
her
head
i
have
the
heavy
deep
sleep
still
in
my
eyes
professor
rubek
you
shall
see
that
day
will
dawn
and
lighten
for
us
both
irene
do
not
believe
that
professor
rubek
urgently
i
do
believe
it
and
i
know
it
now
that
i
have
found
you
again
irene
risen
from
the
grave
professor
rubek
transfigured
irene
only
risen
arnold
not
transfigured
he
crosses
over
to
her
by
means
of
below
the
cascade
professor
rubek
where
have
you
been
all
day
irene
irene
pointing
far
far
over
there
on
the
great
dead
waste
professor
rubek
turning
the
conversation
you
have
not
your
your
friend
with
you
i
see
irene
smiling
my
friend
is
keeping
a
close
watch
on
me
none
the
less
professor
rubek
can
she
irene
glancing
furtively
around
you
may
be
sure
she
can
wherever
i
may
go
she
never
loses
sight
of
me
whispering
until
one
fine
sunny
morning
i
shall
kill
her
professor
rubek
would
you
do
that
irene
with
the
utmost
delight
if
only
i
could
manage
it
professor
rubek
why
do
you
want
to
irene
because
she
deals
in
witchcraft
mysteriously
only
think
arnold
she
has
changed
herself
into
my
shadow
professor
rubek
trying
to
calm
her
well
well
well
a
shadow
we
must
all
have
irene
i
am
my
own
shadow
with
an
outburst
do
you
not
understand
that
professor
rubek
sadly
yes
yes
irene
i
understand
he
seats
himself
on
a
stone
beside
the
brook
she
stands
behind
him
leaning
against
the
wall
of
rock
irene
after
a
pause
why
do
you
sit
there
turning
your
eyes
away
from
me
professor
rubek
softly
shaking
his
head
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
look
at
you
irene
why
dare
you
not
look
at
me
any
more
professor
rubek
you
have
a
shadow
that
tortures
me
and
i
have
the
crushing
weight
of
my
conscience
irene
with
a
glad
cry
of
deliverance
at
last
professor
rubek
springs
up
irene
what
is
it
irene
motioning
him
off
keep
still
still
still
draws
a
deep
breath
and
says
as
though
relieved
of
a
burden
there
now
they
let
me
go
for
this
now
we
can
sit
down
and
talk
as
we
used
to
when
i
was
alive
professor
rubek
oh
if
only
we
could
talk
as
we
used
to
irene
sit
there
where
you
were
sitting
i
will
sit
here
beside
you
he
sits
down
again
she
seats
herself
on
another
stone
close
to
him
irene
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
now
i
have
come
back
to
you
from
the
uttermost
regions
arnold
professor
rubek
aye
truly
from
an
endless
journey
irene
come
home
to
my
lord
and
master
professor
rubek
to
our
home
to
our
own
home
irene
irene
have
you
looked
for
my
coming
every
single
day
professor
rubek
how
dared
i
look
for
you
irene
with
a
sidelong
glance
no
i
suppose
you
dared
not
for
you
understood
nothing
professor
rubek
was
it
really
not
for
the
sake
of
some
one
else
that
you
all
of
a
sudden
disappeared
from
me
in
that
way
irene
might
it
not
quite
well
be
for
your
sake
arnold
professor
rubek
looks
doubtfully
at
her
i
do
understand
you
irene
when
i
had
served
you
with
my
soul
and
with
my
body
when
the
statue
stood
there
finished
our
child
as
you
called
it
then
i
laid
at
your
feet
the
most
precious
sacrifice
of
all
by
effacing
myself
for
all
time
professor
rubek
bows
his
head
and
laying
my
life
waste
irene
suddenly
firing
up
it
was
just
that
i
wanted
never
never
should
you
create
anything
again
after
you
had
created
that
only
child
of
ours
professor
rubek
was
it
jealously
that
moved
you
then
irene
coldly
i
think
it
was
rather
hatred
professor
rubek
hatred
hatred
for
me
irene
again
vehemently
yes
for
you
for
the
artist
who
had
so
lightly
and
carelessly
taken
a
body
a
young
human
life
and
worn
the
soul
out
of
it
because
you
needed
it
for
a
work
of
art
professor
rubek
and
you
can
say
that
you
who
threw
yourself
into
my
work
with
such
passion
and
such
ardent
joy
that
work
for
which
we
two
met
together
every
morning
as
for
an
act
of
worship
irene
coldly
as
before
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
arnold
professor
rubek
well
irene
i
never
loved
your
art
before
i
met
nor
after
either
professor
rubek
but
the
artist
irene
irene
the
artist
i
hate
professor
rubek
the
artist
in
me
too
irene
in
you
most
of
all
when
i
unclothed
myself
and
stood
for
you
then
i
hated
you
arnold
professor
rubek
warmly
that
you
did
not
irene
that
is
not
true
irene
i
hated
you
because
you
could
stand
there
so
unmoved
professor
rubek
laughs
unmoved
do
you
think
so
irene
at
any
rate
so
intolerably
and
because
you
were
an
artist
and
an
artist
only
not
a
man
changing
to
a
tone
full
of
warmth
and
feeling
but
that
statue
in
the
wet
living
clay
that
i
loved
as
it
rose
up
a
vital
human
creature
out
of
those
raw
shapeless
masses
for
that
was
our
creation
our
child
mine
and
yours
professor
rubek
sadly
it
was
so
in
spirit
and
in
truth
irene
let
me
tell
you
arnold
it
is
for
the
sake
of
this
child
of
ours
that
i
have
undertaken
this
long
pilgrimage
professor
rubek
suddenly
alert
for
the
statue
irene
call
it
what
you
will
i
call
it
our
child
professor
rubek
and
now
you
want
to
see
it
finished
in
marble
which
you
always
thought
so
cold
eagerly
you
do
not
know
perhaps
that
it
is
installed
in
a
great
museum
somewhere
far
out
in
the
world
irene
i
have
heard
a
sort
of
legend
about
it
professor
rubek
and
museums
were
always
a
horror
to
you
you
called
them
irene
i
will
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
place
where
my
soul
and
my
child
soul
lie
buried
professor
rubek
uneasy
and
alarmed
you
must
never
see
that
statue
again
do
you
hear
irene
i
implore
you
never
never
see
it
again
irene
perhaps
you
think
it
would
mean
death
to
me
a
second
time
professor
rubek
clenching
his
hands
together
oh
i
do
know
what
i
but
how
could
i
ever
imagine
that
you
would
fix
your
mind
so
immovably
on
that
statue
you
who
went
away
from
me
before
it
was
completed
irene
it
was
completed
that
was
why
i
could
go
away
from
you
and
leave
you
alone
professor
rubek
sits
with
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
rocking
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
his
hands
before
his
eyes
it
was
not
what
it
afterwards
became
irene
quietly
but
quick
as
lightning
a
sharp
knife
which
she
carried
in
her
breast
and
asks
in
a
hoarse
whisper
arnold
have
you
done
any
evil
to
our
child
professor
rubek
evasively
any
evil
how
can
i
be
sure
what
you
would
call
it
irene
breathless
tell
me
at
once
what
have
you
done
to
the
child
professor
rubek
i
will
tell
you
if
you
will
sit
and
listen
quietly
to
what
i
say
irene
hides
the
knife
i
will
listen
as
quietly
as
a
mother
can
when
she
professor
rubek
interrupting
and
you
must
not
look
at
me
while
i
am
telling
you
irene
moves
to
a
stone
behind
his
back
i
will
sit
here
behind
now
tell
me
professor
rubek
takes
his
hands
from
before
his
eyes
and
gazes
straight
in
front
of
him
when
i
had
found
you
i
knew
at
once
how
i
should
make
use
of
you
for
my
irene
the
resurrection
day
you
called
your
i
call
it
our
child
professor
rubek
i
was
young
then
with
no
knowledge
of
life
the
resurrection
i
thought
would
be
most
beautifully
and
exquisitely
figured
as
a
young
unsullied
woman
with
none
of
our
experiences
awakening
to
light
and
glory
without
having
to
put
away
from
her
anything
ugly
and
impure
irene
quickly
yes
and
so
i
stand
there
now
in
our
work
professor
rubek
hesitating
not
absolutely
and
entirely
so
irene
irene
in
rising
excitement
not
absolutely
do
i
not
stand
as
i
always
stood
for
you
professor
rubek
without
answering
i
learned
worldly
wisdom
in
the
years
that
followed
irene
the
resurrection
day
became
in
my
mind
eye
something
more
and
something
something
more
complex
the
little
round
plinth
on
which
your
figure
stood
erect
and
solitary
it
no
longer
afforded
room
for
all
the
imagery
i
now
wanted
to
add
irene
groped
for
her
knife
but
desists
what
imagery
did
you
add
then
tell
me
professor
rubek
i
imagined
that
which
i
saw
with
my
eyes
around
me
in
the
world
i
had
to
include
it
i
could
not
help
it
irene
i
expanded
the
plinth
made
it
wide
and
spacious
and
on
it
i
placed
a
segment
of
the
curving
bursting
earth
and
up
from
the
fissures
of
the
soil
there
now
swarm
men
and
women
with
women
and
men
as
i
knew
them
in
real
life
irene
in
breathless
suspense
but
in
the
middle
of
the
rout
there
stands
the
young
woman
radiant
with
the
joy
of
light
do
i
not
stand
so
arnold
professor
rubek
evasively
not
quite
in
the
middle
i
had
unfortunately
to
move
that
figure
a
little
back
for
the
sake
of
the
general
effect
you
understand
otherwise
it
would
have
dominated
the
whole
too
much
irene
but
the
joy
in
the
light
still
transfigures
my
face
professor
rubek
yes
it
does
irene
in
a
way
a
little
subdued
perhaps
as
my
altered
idea
required
irene
rising
noiselessly
that
design
expresses
the
life
you
now
see
arnold
professor
rubek
yes
i
suppose
it
does
irene
and
in
that
design
you
have
shifted
me
back
a
little
toned
down
to
serve
as
a
in
a
group
she
draws
the
knife
professor
rubek
not
a
let
us
say
at
most
a
figure
not
quite
in
the
foreground
or
something
of
that
sort
irene
whispers
hoarsely
there
you
uttered
your
own
doom
on
the
point
of
striking
professor
rubek
turns
and
looks
up
at
her
doom
irene
hastily
hides
the
knife
and
says
as
though
choked
with
agony
my
whole
soul
you
and
i
we
we
we
and
our
child
were
in
that
solitary
figure
professor
rubek
eagerly
taking
off
his
hat
and
drying
the
drops
of
sweat
upon
his
brow
yes
but
let
me
tell
you
too
how
i
have
placed
myself
in
the
group
in
front
beside
a
fountain
as
it
were
here
sits
a
man
weighed
down
with
guilt
who
can
not
quite
free
himself
from
the
i
call
him
remorse
for
a
forfeited
life
he
sits
there
and
dips
his
fingers
in
the
purling
stream
to
wash
them
clean
and
he
is
gnawed
and
tortured
by
the
thought
that
never
never
will
he
succeed
never
in
all
eternity
will
he
attain
to
freedom
and
the
new
life
he
will
remain
for
ever
prisoned
in
his
hell
irene
hardly
and
coldly
poet
professor
rubek
why
poet
irene
because
you
are
nerveless
and
sluggish
and
full
of
forgiveness
for
all
the
sins
of
your
life
in
thought
and
in
act
you
have
killed
my
soul
so
you
model
yourself
in
remorse
and
and
penance
smiling
and
with
that
you
think
your
account
is
cleared
professor
rubek
defiantly
i
am
an
artist
irene
and
i
take
no
shame
to
myself
for
the
frailties
that
perhaps
cling
to
me
for
i
was
born
to
be
an
artist
you
see
and
do
what
i
may
i
shall
never
be
anything
else
irene
looks
at
him
with
a
lurking
evil
smile
and
says
gently
and
softly
you
are
a
poet
arnold
softly
strokes
his
hair
you
dear
great
child
is
it
possible
that
you
can
not
see
that
professor
rubek
annoyed
why
do
you
keep
on
calling
me
a
poet
irene
with
malign
eyes
because
there
is
something
apologetic
in
the
word
my
friend
something
that
suggests
forgiveness
of
sins
and
spreads
a
cloak
over
all
frailty
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
but
i
was
a
human
being
then
and
i
too
had
a
life
to
live
and
a
human
destiny
to
fulfil
and
all
that
look
you
i
let
slip
gave
it
all
up
in
order
to
make
myself
your
oh
it
was
a
deadly
sin
against
myself
half
whispering
and
that
sin
i
can
never
expiate
she
seats
herself
near
him
beside
the
brook
keeps
close
though
unnoticed
watch
upon
him
and
as
though
in
absence
of
mind
plucks
some
flowers
form
the
shrubs
around
them
irene
with
apparent
i
should
have
borne
children
in
the
world
many
children
real
children
not
such
children
as
are
hidden
away
in
that
was
my
vocation
i
ought
never
to
have
served
you
poet
professor
rubek
lost
in
recollection
yet
those
were
beautiful
days
irene
marvellously
beautiful
days
as
i
now
look
back
upon
them
irene
looking
at
him
with
a
soft
expression
can
you
remember
a
little
word
that
you
said
when
you
had
finished
finished
with
me
and
with
our
child
nods
to
him
can
you
remember
that
little
word
arnold
professor
rubek
looks
inquiringly
at
her
did
i
say
a
little
word
then
which
you
still
remember
irene
yes
you
did
can
you
not
recall
it
professor
rubek
shaking
his
head
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
not
at
the
present
moment
at
any
rate
irene
you
took
both
my
hands
and
pressed
them
warmly
and
i
stood
there
in
breathless
expectation
and
then
you
said
so
now
irene
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
this
you
said
has
been
a
priceless
episode
for
me
professor
rubek
looks
doubtfully
at
her
did
i
say
episode
it
is
not
a
word
i
am
in
the
habit
of
using
irene
you
said
episode
professor
rubek
with
assumed
cheerfulness
well
well
after
all
it
was
in
reality
an
episode
irene
curtly
at
that
word
i
left
you
professor
rubek
you
take
everything
so
painfully
to
heart
irene
irene
drawing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
perhaps
you
are
right
let
us
shake
off
all
the
hard
things
that
go
to
the
heart
plucks
off
the
leaves
of
a
mountain
rose
and
strews
them
on
the
brook
look
there
arnold
there
are
our
birds
swimming
professor
rubek
what
birds
are
they
irene
can
you
not
see
of
course
they
are
flamingoes
are
they
not
professor
rubek
flamingoes
do
not
swim
they
only
wade
irene
then
they
are
not
flamingoes
they
are
professor
rubek
they
may
be
with
red
bills
yes
plucks
broad
green
leaves
and
throws
them
into
the
brook
now
i
send
out
my
ships
after
them
irene
but
there
must
be
no
on
board
professor
rubek
no
there
shall
be
no
smiles
to
her
can
you
remember
the
summer
when
we
used
to
sit
like
this
outside
the
little
peasant
hut
on
the
lake
of
taunitz
irene
nods
on
saturday
evenings
yes
when
we
had
finished
our
work
professor
rubek
and
taken
the
train
out
to
the
lake
to
stay
there
over
sunday
irene
with
an
evil
gleam
of
hatred
in
her
eyes
it
was
an
episode
arnold
professor
rubek
as
if
not
hearing
then
too
you
used
to
set
birds
swimming
in
the
brook
they
were
which
you
irene
they
were
white
swans
professor
rubek
i
meant
swans
yes
and
i
remember
that
i
fastened
a
great
furry
leaf
to
one
of
the
swans
it
looked
like
a
irene
and
then
it
turned
into
lohengrin
boat
with
the
swan
yoked
to
it
professor
rubek
how
fond
you
were
of
that
game
irene
irene
we
played
it
over
and
over
again
professor
rubek
every
single
saturday
i
believe
all
the
summer
through
irene
you
said
i
was
the
swan
that
drew
your
boat
professor
rubek
did
i
say
so
yes
i
daresay
i
did
absorbed
in
the
game
just
see
how
the
are
swimming
down
the
stream
irene
laughing
and
all
your
ships
have
run
ashore
professor
rubek
throwing
more
leaves
into
the
brook
i
have
ships
enough
in
reserve
follows
the
leaves
with
his
eyes
throws
more
into
the
brook
and
says
after
a
pause
irene
i
have
bought
the
little
peasant
hut
beside
the
lake
of
taunitz
irene
have
you
bought
it
you
often
said
you
would
if
you
could
afford
it
professor
rubek
the
day
came
when
i
could
afford
it
easily
enough
and
so
i
bought
it
irene
with
a
sidelong
look
at
him
then
do
you
live
out
there
now
in
our
old
house
professor
rubek
no
i
have
had
it
pulled
down
long
ago
and
i
have
built
myself
a
great
handsome
comfortable
villa
on
the
site
with
a
park
around
it
it
is
there
that
we
stops
and
corrects

during
the
summer
irene
mastering
herself

other
one

rubek
with
a
touch
of
defiance
yes
when
my
wife
and
i
are
not
travelling
as
we
are
this
year
irene
looking
far
before
her
life
was
beautiful
beautiful
by
the
lake
of
taunitz
professor
rubek
as
though
looking
back
into
himself
and
yet
irene
irene
completing
his
thought
yet
we
two
let
slip
all
that
life
and
its
beauty
professor
rubek
softly
urgently
does
repentance
come
too
late
now
irene
does
not
answer
but
sits
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
points
over
the
upland
look
there
arnold
now
the
sun
is
going
down
behind
the
peaks
see
what
a
red
glow
the
level
rays
cast
over
all
the
heathery
knolls
out
yonder
professor
rubek
looks
where
she
is
pointing
it
is
long
since
i
have
seen
a
sunset
in
the
mountains
irene
or
a
sunrise
professor
rubek
a
sunrise
i
do
think
i
have
ever
seen
irene
smiles
as
though
lost
in
recollection
i
once
saw
a
marvellously
lovely
sunrise
professor
rubek
did
you
where
was
that
irene
high
high
up
on
a
dizzy
you
beguiled
me
up
there
by
promising
that
i
should
see
all
the
glory
of
the
world
if
only
i
she
stops
suddenly
professor
rubek
if
only
you
well
irene
i
did
as
you
told
me
went
with
you
up
to
the
heights
and
there
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
worshipped
you
and
served
you
is
silent
for
a
moment
then
says
softly

i
saw
the
sunrise
professor
rubek
turning
at
him
with
a
scornful
smile
with
you
and
the
other
woman
professor
rubek
urgently
with
me
as
in
our
days
of
creation

could
open
all
that

locked
up
in
me

not

it
in
your
heart

head

the
life

off

and
strew

after
a
short
pause
a
summer
night

turns
involuntarily
where
with
a
start

sister
of

is
partly
visible
among

rubek
looks
inquiringly
at
her
when

when
we

professor
rubek
shakes
his
head
mournfully
what

we
really
see

see
that
we
have
never
lived
she
goes
towards
the
slope
and
descends

sister
of
mercy
makes
way
for
her
and
follows
her
professor
rubek
remains
sitting
motionless
beside
the
brook
maia
is
heard
singing
triumphantly
among
the
hills
i
am
free
i
am
free
i
am
free
no
more
life
in
the
prison
for
me
i
am
free
as
a
bird
i
am
free
act
third
a
wild
riven
with
sheer
precipices
at
the
back
peaks
rise
to
the
right
and
lose
themselves
in
drifting
mists
to
the
left
on
a
stands
an
old
hut
it
is
early
morning
dawn
is
breaking
the
sun
has
not
yet
risen
maia
comes
flushed
and
irritated
down
over
the
on
the
left
ulfheim
follows
half
angry
half
laughing
holding
her
fast
by
the
sleeve
maia
trying
to
tear
herself
loose
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
say
ulfheim
come
come
are
you
going
to
bite
now
you
as
snappish
as
a
wolf
maia
striking
him
over
the
hand
let
me
i
tell
you
and
be
quiet
ulfheim
no
confound
me
if
i
will
maia
then
i
will
not
go
another
step
with
you
do
you
hear
not
a
single
step
ulfheim
ho
ho
how
can
you
get
away
from
me
here
on
the
wild
maia
i
will
jump
over
the
precipice
yonder
if
need
be
ulfheim
and
mangle
and
mash
yourself
up
into
a
juicy
morsel
lets
go
his
hold
as
you
please
jump
over
the
precipice
if
you
want
to
it
a
dizzy
drop
there
only
one
narrow
footpath
down
it
and
almost
impassable
maia
dusts
her
skirt
with
her
hand
and
looks
at
him
with
angry
eyes
well
you
are
a
nice
one
to
go
hunting
with
ulfheim
say
rather
sporting
maia
oh
so
you
call
this
sport
do
you
ulfheim
yes
i
venture
to
take
that
liberty
it
is
the
sort
of
sport
i
like
best
of
all
maia
tossing
her
head
well
i
must
say
after
a
pause
looks
searchingly
at
him
why
did
you
let
the
dogs
loose
up
there
ulfheim
blinking
his
eyes
and
smiling
so
that
they
too
might
do
a
little
hunting
on
their
own
account
do
you
see
maia
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
it
was
for
the
dogs
sake
that
you
let
them
go
ulfheim
still
smiling
well
why
did
i
let
them
go
then
let
us
hear
maia
you
let
them
go
because
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
lars
he
was
to
run
after
them
and
bring
them
in
again
you
said
and
in
the
oh
it
was
a
pretty
way
to
behave
ulfheim
in
the
meantime
maia
curtly
breaking
off
no
matter
ulfheim
in
a
confidential
tone
lars
wo
find
them
you
may
safely
swear
to
that
he
wo
come
with
them
before
the
time
up
maia
looking
angrily
at
him
no
i
daresay
not
ulfheim
catching
at
her
arm
for
lars
he
knows
my
my
methods
of
sport
you
see
maia
eludes
him
and
measures
him
with
a
glance
do
you
know
what
you
look
like
ulfheim
ulfheim
i
should
think
i
probably
most
like
myself
maia
yes
there
you
exactly
right
for
you
the
living
image
of
a
faun
ulfheim
a
faun
maia
yes
precisely
a
faun
ulfheim
a
faun
is
that
a
sort
of
monster
or
a
kind
of
a
wood
demon
as
you
might
call
it
maia
yes
just
the
sort
of
creature
you
are
a
thing
with
a
goat
beard
and
yes
and
the
faun
has
horns
too
ulfheim
so
so
has
he
horns
too
maia
a
pair
of
ugly
horns
just
like
yours
yes
ulfheim
can
you
see
the
poor
little
horns
have
maia
yes
i
seem
to
see
them
quite
plainly
ulfheim
taking
the
dogs
leash
out
of
his
pocket
then
i
had
better
see
about
tying
you
maia
have
you
gone
quite
mad
would
you
tie
me
ulfheim
if
i
am
a
demon
let
me
be
a
demon
so
that
the
way
of
it
you
can
see
the
horns
can
you
maia
soothingly
there
there
there
now
try
to
behave
nicely
ulfheim
breaking
off
but
what
has
become
of
that
of
yours
that
you
boasted
so
much
of
you
said
it
lay
somewhere
hereabouts
ulfheim
points
with
a
flourish
to
the
hut
there
you
have
it
before
your
very
eyes
maia
looks
at
him
that
old
ulfheim
laughing
in
his
beard
it
has
harboured
more
than
one
king
daughter
i
can
tell
you
maia
was
it
there
that
that
horrid
man
you
told
me
about
came
to
the
daughter
in
the
form
of
a
bear
ulfheim
yes
my
fair
companion
of
the
chase
this
is
the
scene
with
a
gesture
of
invitation
if
you
would
deign
to
enter
maia
isch
if
ever
i
set
foot
in
it
isch
ulfheim
oh
two
people
can
doze
away
a
summer
night
in
there
comfortably
enough
or
a
whole
summer
if
it
comes
to
that
maia
thanks
one
would
need
to
have
a
pretty
strong
taste
for
that
kind
of
thing
impatiently
but
now
i
am
tired
both
of
you
and
the
hunting
expedition
now
i
am
going
down
to
the
hotel
before
people
awaken
down
there
ulfheim
how
do
you
propose
to
get
down
from
here
maia
that
your
affair
there
must
be
a
way
down
somewhere
or
other
i
suppose
ulfheim
pointing
towards
the
back
oh
certainly
there
is
a
sort
of
way
right
down
the
face
of
the
precipice
yonder
maia
there
you
see
with
a
little
goodwill
ulfheim
but
just
you
try
if
you
dare
go
that
way
maia
doubtfully
do
you
think
i
ca
ulfheim
never
in
this
world
if
you
do
let
me
help
you
maia
uneasily
why
then
come
and
help
me
what
else
are
you
here
for
ulfheim
would
you
rather
i
should
take
you
on
my
back
maia
nonsense
ulfheim
or
carry
you
in
my
arms
maia
now
do
stop
talking
that
rubbish
ulfheim
with
suppressed
exasperation
i
once
took
a
young
girl
lifted
her
up
from
the
mire
of
the
streets
and
carried
her
in
my
arms
next
my
heart
i
carried
her
so
i
would
have
borne
her
all
through
life
lest
haply
she
should
dash
her
foot
against
a
stone
for
her
shoes
were
worn
very
thin
when
i
found
her
maia
and
yet
you
took
her
up
and
carried
her
next
your
heart
ulfheim
took
her
up
out
of
the
gutter
and
carried
her
as
high
and
as
carefully
as
i
could
with
a
growling
laugh
and
do
you
know
what
i
got
for
my
reward
maia
no
what
did
you
get
ulfheim
looks
at
her
smiles
and
nods
i
got
the
horns
the
horns
that
you
can
see
so
plainly
is
not
that
a
comical
story
madam
maia
oh
yes
comical
enough
but
i
know
another
story
that
is
still
more
comical
ulfheim
how
does
that
story
go
maia
this
is
how
it
goes
there
was
once
a
stupid
girl
who
had
both
a
father
and
a
mother
but
a
rather
home
then
there
came
a
high
and
mighty
seigneur
into
the
midst
of
all
this
poverty
and
he
took
the
girl
in
his
arms
as
you
did
and
travelled
far
far
away
with
her
ulfheim
was
she
so
anxious
to
be
with
him
maia
yes
for
she
was
stupid
you
see
ulfheim
and
he
no
doubt
was
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
personage
maia
oh
no
he
was
so
superlatively
beautiful
either
but
he
pretended
that
he
would
take
her
with
him
to
the
top
of
the
highest
of
mountains
where
there
were
light
and
sunshine
without
end
ulfheim
so
he
was
a
mountaineer
was
he
that
man
maia
yes
he
was
in
his
way
ulfheim
and
then
he
took
the
girl
up
with
him
maia
with
a
toss
of
the
head
took
her
up
with
him
finely
you
may
be
sure
oh
no
he
beguiled
her
into
a
cold
clammy
cage
where
as
it
seemed
to
her
there
was
neither
sunlight
nor
fresh
air
but
only
gilding
and
great
petrified
ghosts
of
people
all
around
the
walls
ulfheim
devil
take
me
but
it
served
her
right
maia
yes
but
do
you
think
it
quite
a
comical
story
all
the
same
ulfheim
looks
at
her
moment
now
listen
to
me
my
good
companion
of
the
chase
maia
well
what
it
is
now
ulfheim
should
not
we
two
tack
our
poor
shreds
of
life
together
maia
is
his
worship
inclined
to
set
up
as
a
ulfheim
yes
indeed
he
is
might
not
we
two
try
to
draw
the
rags
together
here
and
there
so
as
to
make
some
sort
of
a
human
life
out
of
them
maia
and
when
the
poor
tatters
were
quite
worn
out
what
then
ulfheim
with
a
large
gesture
then
there
we
shall
stand
free
and
serene
as
the
man
and
woman
we
really
are
maia
laughing
you
with
your
yes
ulfheim
and
you
with
your
well
let
that
pass
maia
yes
come
let
us
pass
on
ulfheim
stop
whither
away
comrade
maia
down
to
the
hotel
of
course
ulfheim
and
afterward
maia
then
we
take
a
polite
leave
of
each
other
with
thanks
for
pleasant
company
ulfheim
can
we
part
we
two
do
you
think
we
can
maia
yes
you
did
manage
to
tie
me
up
you
know
ulfheim
i
have
a
castle
to
offer
you
maia
pointing
to
the
hut
a
fellow
to
that
one
ulfheim
it
has
not
fallen
to
ruin
yet
maia
and
all
the
glory
of
the
world
perhaps
ulfheim
a
castle
i
tell
you
maia
thanks
i
have
had
enough
of
castles
ulfheim
with
splendid
stretching
for
miles
around
it
maia
are
there
works
of
art
too
in
this
castle
ulfheim
slowly
well
no
it
true
there
are
no
works
of
art
but
maia
relieved
ah
that
one
good
thing
at
any
rate
ulfheim
will
you
go
with
me
then
as
far
and
as
long
as
i
want
you
maia
there
is
a
tame
bird
of
prey
keeping
watch
upon
me
ulfheim
wildly
we
put
a
bullet
in
his
wing
maia
maia
looks
at
him
a
moment
and
says
resolutely
come
then
and
carry
me
down
into
the
depths
ulfheim
puts
his
arm
round
her
waist
it
is
high
time
the
mist
is
upon
us
maia
is
the
way
down
terribly
dangerous
ulfheim
the
mountain
is
more
dangerous
still
she
shakes
him
off
goes
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
looks
over
but
starts
quickly
back
ulfheim
goes
towards
her
laughing
what
does
it
make
you
a
little
giddy
maia
faintly
yes
that
too
but
go
and
look
over
those
two
coming
up
ulfheim
goes
and
bends
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
it
only
your
bird
of
prey
and
his
strange
lady
maia
ca
we
get
past
them
without
their
seeing
us
ulfheim
impossible
the
path
is
far
too
narrow
and
there
no
other
way
down
maia
nerving
herself
well
well
let
us
face
them
here
then
ulfheim
spoken
like
a
true
comrade
professor
rubek
and
irene
appear
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
at
the
back
he
has
his
plaid
over
his
shoulders
she
has
a
fur
cloak
thrown
loosely
over
her
white
dress
and
a
swansdown
hood
over
her
head
professor
rubek
still
only
half
visible
above
the
edge
what
maia
so
we
two
meet
once
again
maia
with
assumed
coolness
at
your
service
wo
you
come
up
professor
rubek
climbs
right
up
and
holds
out
his
hand
to
irene
who
also
comes
right
to
the
top
professor
rubek
coldly
to
maia
so
you
too
have
been
all
night
on
the
mountain
as
we
have
maia
i
have
been
hunting
yes
you
gave
me
permission
you
know
ulfheim
pointing
downward
have
you
come
up
that
path
there
professor
rubek
as
you
saw
ulfheim
and
the
strange
lady
too
professor
rubek
yes
of
course
with
a
glance
at
maia
henceforth
the
strange
lady
and
i
do
not
intend
our
ways
to
part
ulfheim
do
you
know
then
that
it
is
a
deadly
dangerous
way
you
have
come
professor
rubek
we
thought
we
would
try
it
nevertheless
for
it
did
not
seem
particularly
hard
at
first
ulfheim
no
at
first
nothing
seems
hard
but
presently
you
may
come
to
a
tight
place
where
you
can
neither
get
forward
nor
back
and
then
you
stick
fast
professor
as
we
hunters
call
it
professor
rubek
smiles
and
looks
at
him
am
i
to
take
these
as
oracular
utterances
ulfheim
ulfheim
lord
preserve
me
from
playing
the
oracle
urgently
pointing
up
towards
the
heights
but
do
you
see
that
the
storm
is
upon
us
do
you
hear
the
blasts
of
wind
professor
rubek
listening
they
sound
like
the
prelude
to
the
resurrection
day
ulfheim
they
are
form
the
peaks
man
just
look
how
the
clouds
are
rolling
and
sinking
soon
they
be
all
around
us
like
a
irene
with
a
start
and
shiver
i
know
that
sheet
maia
drawing
ulfheim
away
let
us
make
haste
and
get
down
ulfheim
to
professor
rubek
i
can
not
help
more
than
one
take
refuge
in
the
hut
in
the
while
the
storm
lasts
then
i
shall
send
people
up
to
fetch
the
two
of
you
away
irene
in
terror
to
fetch
us
away
no
no
ulfheim
harshly
to
take
you
by
force
if
necessary
for
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
here
now
you
know
it
to
maia
come
then
and
do
fear
to
trust
yourself
in
your
comrade
hands
maia
clinging
to
him
oh
how
i
shall
rejoice
and
sing
if
i
get
down
with
a
whole
skin
ulfheim
begins
the
descent
and
calls
to
the
others
you
wait
then
in
the
hut
till
the
men
come
with
ropes
and
fetch
you
away
ulfheim
with
maia
in
his
arms
clambers
rapidly
but
warily
down
the
precipice
irene
looks
for
some
time
at
professor
rubek
with
eyes
did
you
hear
that
arnold
men
are
coming
up
to
fetch
me
away
many
men
will
come
up
here
professor
rubek
do
not
be
alarmed
irene
irene
in
growing
terror
and
she
the
woman
in
black
she
will
come
too
for
she
must
have
missed
me
long
ago
and
then
she
will
seize
me
arnold
and
put
me
in
the
oh
she
has
it
with
her
in
her
box
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
professor
rubek
not
a
soul
shall
be
suffered
to
touch
you
irene
with
a
wild
smile
oh
no
i
myself
have
a
resource
against
that
professor
rubek
what
resource
do
you
mean
irene
drawing
out
the
knife
this
professor
rubek
tries
to
seize
it
have
you
a
knife
irene
always
always
both
day
and
night
in
bed
as
well
professor
rubek
give
me
that
knife
irene
irene
concealing
it
you
shall
not
have
it
i
may
very
likely
find
a
use
for
it
myself
professor
rubek
what
use
can
you
have
for
it
here
irene
looks
fixedly
at
him
it
was
intended
for
you
arnold
professor
rubek
for
me
irene
as
we
were
sitting
by
the
lake
of
taunitz
last
evening
professor
rubek
by
the
lake
of
irene
outside
the
peasant
hut
and
playing
with
swans
and
professor
rubek
what
then
what
then
irene
and
when
i
heard
you
say
with
such
deathly
icy
coldness
that
i
was
nothing
but
an
episode
in
your
life
professor
rubek
it
was
you
that
said
that
irene
not
irene
continuing
then
i
had
my
knife
out
i
wanted
to
stab
you
in
the
back
with
it
professor
rubek
darkly
and
why
did
you
hold
your
hand
irene
because
it
flashed
upon
me
with
a
sudden
horror
that
you
were
dead
already
long
ago
professor
rubek
dead
irene
dead
dead
you
as
well
as
i
we
sat
there
by
the
lake
of
taunitz
we
two
bodies
and
played
with
each
other
professor
rubek
i
do
not
call
that
being
dead
but
you
do
not
understand
me
irene
then
where
is
the
burning
desire
for
me
that
you
fought
and
battled
against
when
i
stood
freely
forth
before
you
as
the
woman
arisen
from
the
dead
professor
rubek
our
love
is
assuredly
not
dead
irene
irene
the
love
that
belongs
to
the
life
of
earth
the
beautiful
miraculous
the
inscrutable
that
is
dead
in
both
of
us
professor
rubek
passionately
and
do
you
know
that
just
that
love
it
is
burning
and
seething
in
me
as
hotly
as
ever
before
irene
and
i
have
you
forgotten
who
i
now
am
professor
rubek
be
who
or
what
you
please
for
aught
i
care
for
me
you
are
the
woman
i
see
in
my
dreams
of
you
irene
i
have
stood
on
the
and
made
a
show
of
myself
to
many
hundreds
of
men
after
you
professor
rubek
it
was
i
that
drove
you
to
the
blind
as
i
then
was
i
who
placed
the
dead
above
the
happiness
of
life
of
love
irene
looking
down
too
late
too
late
professor
rubek
not
by
a
hairsbreadth
has
all
that
has
passed
in
the
interval
lowered
you
in
my
eyes
irene
with
head
erect
nor
in
my
own
professor
rubek
well
what
then
then
we
are
free
and
there
is
still
time
for
us
to
live
our
life
irene
irene
looks
sadly
at
him
the
desire
for
life
is
dead
in
me
arnold
now
i
have
arisen
and
i
look
for
you
and
i
find
and
then
i
see
that
you
and
life
lie
dead
as
i
have
lain
professor
rubek
oh
how
utterly
you
are
astray
both
in
us
and
around
us
life
is
fermenting
and
throbbing
as
fiercely
as
ever
irene
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
the
young
woman
of
your
resurrection
day
can
see
all
life
lying
on
its
bier
professor
rubek
throwing
his
arms
violently
around
her
then
let
two
of
the
dead
us
two
for
once
live
life
to
its
uttermost
before
we
go
down
to
our
graves
again
irene
with
a
shriek
arnold
professor
rubek
but
not
here
in
the
half
darkness
not
here
with
this
hideous
dank
shroud
flapping
around
us
irene
carried
away
by
passion
no
no
up
in
the
light
and
in
all
the
glittering
glory
up
to
the
peak
of
promise
professor
rubek
there
we
will
hold
our
irene
oh
my
beloved
irene
proudly
the
sun
may
freely
look
on
us
arnold
professor
rubek
all
the
powers
of
light
may
freely
look
on
us
and
all
the
powers
of
darkness
too
seizes
her
hand
will
you
then
follow
me
oh
my
bride
irene
as
though
transfigured
i
follow
you
freely
and
gladly
my
lord
and
master
professor
rubek
drawing
her
along
with
him
we
must
first
pass
through
the
mists
irene
and
then
irene
yes
through
all
the
mists
and
then
right
up
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
that
shines
in
the
sunrise
the
close
in
over
the
scene
professor
rubek
and
irene
hand
in
hand
climb
up
over
the
to
the
right
and
soon
disappear
among
the
lower
clouds
keen
hurtle
and
whistle
through
the
air
the
sister
of
mercy
appears
upon
the
to
the
left
she
stops
and
looks
around
silently
and
searchingly
maia
i
am
free
i
am
free
i
am
free
no
more
life
in
the
prison
for
me
i
am
free
as
a
bird
i
am
free
suddenly
a
sound
like
thunder
is
heard
from
high
up
on
the
field
which
glides
and
whirls
downwards
with
headlong
speed
professor
rubek
and
irene
can
be
dimly
discerned
as
they
are
whirled
along
with
the
masses
of
snow
and
buried
in
them
the
sister
of
mercy
gives
a
shriek
stretches
out
her
arms
towards
them
and
cries
irene
stands
silent
a
moment
then
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
before
her
in
the
air
and
says
pax
vobiscum
maia
triumphant
song
sounds
from
still
farther
down
below
