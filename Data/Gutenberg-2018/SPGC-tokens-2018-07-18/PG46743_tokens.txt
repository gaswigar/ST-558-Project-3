preface
to
the
first
edition
in
offering
to
the
public
a
new
book
upon
a
subject
so
trite
as
ethics
it
seems
desirable
to
indicate
clearly
at
the
outset
its
plan
and
purpose
its
distinctive
characteristics
may
be
first
given
negatively
it
is
not
in
the
main
metaphysical
or
psychological
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
dogmatic
or
directly
practical
it
does
not
deal
except
by
way
of
illustration
with
the
history
of
ethical
thought
in
a
sense
it
might
be
said
to
be
not
even
critical
since
it
is
only
quite
incidentally
that
it
offers
any
criticism
of
the
systems
of
individual
moralists
it
claims
to
be
an
examination
at
once
expository
and
critical
of
the
different
methods
of
obtaining
reasoned
convictions
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
which
are
to
be
found
either
explicit
or
implicit
in
the
moral
consciousness
of
mankind
generally
and
which
from
time
to
time
have
been
developed
either
singly
or
in
combination
by
individual
thinkers
and
worked
up
into
the
systems
now
historical
i
have
avoided
the
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
the
moral
faculty
which
has
perhaps
occupied
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
attention
of
modern
moralists
by
the
simple
assumption
which
seems
to
be
made
implicitly
in
all
ethical
reasoning
that
there
is
something
under
any
given
circumstances
which
it
is
right
or
reasonable
to
do
and
that
this
may
be
known
if
it
be
admitted
that
we
now
have
the
faculty
of
knowing
this
it
appears
to
me
that
the
investigation
of
the
historical
antecedents
of
this
cognition
and
of
its
relation
to
other
elements
of
the
mind
no
more
properly
belongs
to
ethics
than
the
corresponding
questions
as
to
the
cognition
of
space
belong
to
geometry
i
make
however
no
further
assumption
as
to
the
nature
of
the
object
of
ethical
knowledge
and
hence
my
treatise
is
not
dogmatic
all
the
different
methods
developed
in
it
are
expounded
and
criticised
from
a
neutral
position
and
as
impartially
as
possible
and
thus
though
my
treatment
of
the
subject
is
in
a
sense
more
practical
than
that
of
many
moralists
since
i
am
occupied
from
first
to
last
in
considering
how
conclusions
are
to
be
rationally
reached
in
the
familiar
matter
of
our
common
daily
life
and
actual
practice
still
my
immediate
object
to
invert
aristotle
s
phrase
is
not
practice
but
knowledge
i
have
thought
that
the
predominance
in
the
minds
of
moralists
of
a
desire
to
edify
has
impeded
the
real
progress
of
ethical
science
and
that
this
would
be
benefited
by
an
application
to
it
of
the
same
disinterested
curiosity
to
which
we
chiefly
owe
the
great
discoveries
of
physics
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
i
have
endeavoured
to
compose
the
present
work
and
with
this
view
i
have
desired
to
concentrate
the
reader
s
attention
from
first
to
last
not
on
the
practical
results
to
which
our
methods
lead
but
on
the
methods
themselves
i
have
wished
to
put
aside
temporarily
the
urgent
need
which
we
all
feel
of
finding
and
adopting
the
true
method
of
determining
what
we
ought
to
do
and
to
consider
simply
what
conclusions
will
be
rationally
reached
if
we
start
with
certain
ethical
premises
and
with
what
degree
of
certainty
and
precision
i
ought
to
mention
that
chapter
iv
of
book
has
been
reprinted
with
considerable
modifications
from
the
in
which
it
originally
appeared
as
an
article
on
pleasure
and
and
i
can
not
conclude
without
a
tribute
of
thanks
to
my
friend
venn
to
whose
kindness
in
accepting
the
somewhat
laborious
task
of
reading
and
criticising
my
work
both
before
and
during
its
passage
through
the
press
i
am
indebted
for
several
improvements
in
my
exposition
preface
to
the
second
edition
in
preparing
this
work
for
the
second
edition
i
have
found
it
desirable
to
make
numerous
alterations
and
additions
indeed
the
extent
which
these
have
reached
is
so
considerable
that
i
have
thought
it
well
to
publish
them
in
a
separate
form
for
the
use
of
purchasers
of
my
first
edition
on
one
or
two
points
i
have
to
acknowledge
a
certain
change
of
view
which
is
partly
at
least
due
to
criticism
for
instance
in
chap
iv
of
book
i
on
pleasure
and
desire
which
has
been
a
good
deal
criticised
by
bain
and
others
although
i
still
retain
my
former
opinion
on
the
psychological
question
at
issue
i
have
been
led
to
take
a
different
view
of
the
relation
of
this
question
to
ethics
and
in
fact
of
this
chapter
as
it
at
present
stands
directly
contradicts
the
corresponding
passage
in
the
former
edition
so
again
as
regards
the
following
chapter
on
though
i
have
not
exactly
found
that
the
comments
which
it
has
called
forth
have
removed
my
difficulties
in
dealing
with
this
problem
i
have
become
convinced
that
i
ought
not
to
have
crudely
obtruded
these
difficulties
on
the
reader
while
professedly
excluding
the
consideration
of
them
from
my
subject
in
the
present
edition
therefore
i
have
carefully
limited
myself
to
explaining
and
justifying
the
view
that
i
take
of
the
practical
aspect
of
the
question
i
have
further
been
led
through
study
of
the
theory
of
evolution
in
its
application
to
practice
to
attach
somewhat
more
importance
to
this
theory
than
i
had
previously
done
and
also
in
several
passages
of
books
iii
and
iv
to
substitute
for
happiness
in
my
exposition
of
that
implicit
reference
to
some
further
end
and
standard
which
reflection
on
the
morality
of
common
sense
continually
brings
into
view
this
latter
change
however
as
i
explain
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
book
iii
is
not
ultimately
found
to
have
any
practical
effect
i
have
also
modified
my
view
of
objective
rightness
as
the
reader
will
see
by
comparing
book
chap
i
with
the
corresponding
passage
in
the
former
edition
but
here
again
the
alteration
has
no
material
importance
in
my
exposition
of
the
utilitarian
principle
book
iv
chap
i
i
have
shortened
the
cumbrous
phrase
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
by
omitting
as
its
author
ultimately
advised
the
last
four
words
and
finally
i
have
yielded
as
far
as
i
could
to
the
objections
that
have
been
strongly
urged
against
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
treatise
the
main
discussion
therein
contained
still
seems
to
me
indispensable
to
the
completeness
of
the
work
but
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
the
chapter
a
new
aspect
by
altering
its
commencement
and
omitting
most
of
the
concluding
paragraph
the
greater
part
however
of
the
new
matter
in
this
edition
is
merely
explanatory
and
supplementary
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
a
fuller
and
clearer
account
of
my
views
on
any
points
on
which
i
either
have
myself
seen
them
to
be
ambiguously
or
inadequately
expressed
or
have
found
by
experience
that
they
were
liable
to
be
misunderstood
thus
in
book
chap
ii
i
have
tried
to
furnish
a
rather
more
instructive
account
than
my
first
edition
contained
of
the
mutual
relations
of
ethics
and
politics
again
even
before
the
appearance
of
leslie
stephen
s
interesting
review
in
march
i
had
seen
the
desirability
of
explaining
further
my
general
view
of
the
practical
reason
and
of
the
fundamental
notion
signified
by
the
terms
right
ought
etc
with
this
object
i
have
entirely
rewritten
chap
iii
of
book
and
made
considerable
changes
in
chap
i
elsewhere
as
in
chaps
vi
and
ix
of
book
and
chap
vi
of
book
i
have
altered
chiefly
in
order
to
make
my
expositions
more
clear
and
symmetrical
this
is
partly
the
case
with
the
considerable
changes
that
i
have
made
in
the
first
three
chapters
of
book
iii
but
i
have
also
tried
to
obviate
the
objections
brought
by
professor
calderwood
against
the
first
of
these
chapters
the
main
part
of
this
book
chaps
has
been
but
slightly
altered
but
in
chap
xiii
on
philosophical
intuitionism
which
has
been
suggestively
criticised
by
more
than
one
writer
i
have
thought
it
expedient
to
give
a
more
direct
statement
of
my
own
opinions
instead
of
confining
myself
as
i
did
in
the
first
edition
to
comments
on
those
of
other
moralists
chap
xiv
again
has
been
considerably
modified
chiefly
in
order
to
introduce
into
it
the
substance
of
certain
portions
of
an
article
on
hedonism
and
ultimate
good
which
i
published
in
no
in
book
iv
the
changes
besides
those
above
mentioned
have
been
inconsiderable
and
have
been
chiefly
made
in
order
to
remove
a
misconception
which
i
shall
presently
notice
as
to
my
general
attitude
towards
the
three
methods
which
i
am
principally
occupied
in
examining
in
revising
my
work
i
have
endeavoured
to
profit
as
much
as
possible
by
all
the
criticisms
on
it
that
have
been
brought
to
my
notice
whether
public
or
private
i
have
frequently
deferred
to
objections
even
when
they
appeared
to
me
unsound
if
i
thought
i
could
avoid
controversy
by
alterations
to
which
i
was
myself
indifferent
where
i
have
been
unable
to
make
the
changes
required
i
have
usually
replied
in
the
text
or
the
notes
to
such
criticisms
as
have
appeared
to
me
plausible
or
in
any
way
instructive
in
so
doing
i
have
sometimes
referred
by
name
to
opponents
where
i
thought
that
from
their
recognised
position
as
teachers
of
the
subject
this
would
give
a
distinct
addition
of
interest
to
the
discussion
but
i
have
been
careful
to
omit
such
reference
where
experience
has
shown
that
it
would
be
likely
to
cause
offence
the
book
is
already
more
controversial
than
i
could
wish
and
i
have
therefore
avoided
encumbering
it
with
any
polemics
of
purely
personal
interest
for
this
reason
i
have
generally
left
unnoticed
such
criticisms
as
have
been
due
to
mere
misapprehensions
against
which
i
thought
i
could
effectually
guard
in
the
present
edition
there
is
however
one
fundamental
misunderstanding
on
which
it
seems
desirable
to
say
a
few
words
i
find
that
more
than
one
critic
has
overlooked
or
disregarded
the
account
of
the
plan
of
my
treatise
given
in
the
original
preface
and
in
of
the
introductory
chapter
and
has
consequently
supposed
me
to
be
writing
as
an
assailant
of
two
of
the
methods
which
i
chiefly
examine
and
a
defender
of
the
third
thus
one
of
my
reviewers
seems
to
regard
book
iii
on
intuitionism
as
containing
mere
hostile
criticism
from
the
outside
another
has
constructed
an
article
on
the
supposition
that
my
principal
object
is
the
suppression
of
egoism
a
third
has
gone
to
the
length
of
a
pamphlet
under
the
impression
apparently
that
the
main
argument
of
my
treatise
is
a
demonstration
of
universalistic
hedonism
i
am
concerned
to
have
caused
so
much
misdirection
of
criticism
and
i
have
carefully
altered
in
this
edition
the
passages
which
i
perceive
to
have
contributed
to
it
the
morality
that
i
examine
in
book
iii
is
my
own
morality
as
much
as
it
is
any
man
s
it
is
as
i
say
the
morality
of
common
sense
which
i
only
attempt
to
represent
in
so
far
as
i
share
it
i
only
place
myself
outside
it
either
temporarily
for
the
purpose
of
impartial
criticism
or
in
so
far
as
i
am
forced
beyond
it
by
a
practical
consciousness
of
its
incompleteness
i
have
certainly
criticised
this
morality
unsparingly
but
i
conceive
myself
to
have
exposed
with
equal
unreserve
the
defects
and
difficulties
of
the
hedonistic
method
cf
especially
chaps
iv
of
book
and
chap
of
book
and
as
regards
the
two
hedonistic
principles
i
do
not
hold
the
reasonableness
of
aiming
at
happiness
generally
with
any
stronger
conviction
than
i
do
that
of
aiming
at
one
s
own
it
was
no
part
of
my
plan
to
call
special
attention
to
this
dualism
of
the
practical
reason
as
i
have
elsewhere
called
it
but
i
am
surprised
at
the
extent
to
which
my
view
has
perplexed
even
those
of
my
critics
who
have
understood
it
i
had
imagined
that
they
would
readily
trace
it
to
the
source
from
which
i
learnt
it
butler
s
sermons
i
hold
with
butler
that
reasonable
and
conscience
are
the
two
chief
or
superior
principles
in
the
nature
of
man
each
of
which
we
are
under
a
manifest
obligation
to
obey
and
i
do
not
i
believe
differ
materially
from
butler
in
my
view
either
of
reasonable
or
theology
apart
of
its
relation
to
conscience
nor
again
do
i
differ
from
him
in
regarding
conscience
as
essentially
a
function
of
the
practical
reason
moral
precepts
he
says
in
the
part
ii
chap
viii
are
precepts
the
reason
of
which
we
my
difference
only
begins
when
i
ask
myself
what
among
the
precepts
of
our
common
conscience
do
we
really
see
to
be
ultimately
reasonable
a
question
which
butler
does
not
seem
to
have
seriously
put
and
to
which
at
any
rate
he
has
given
no
satisfactory
answer
the
answer
that
i
found
to
it
supplied
the
rational
basis
that
i
had
long
perceived
to
be
wanting
to
the
utilitarianism
of
bentham
regarded
as
an
ethical
doctrine
and
thus
enabled
me
to
transcend
the
commonly
received
antithesis
between
intuitionists
and
utilitarians
footnotes
i
did
not
mean
to
exclude
the
supposition
that
two
or
more
alternatives
might
under
certain
circumstances
be
equally
right
this
statement
now
appears
to
me
to
require
a
slight
modification
cf
no
among
unpublished
criticisms
i
ought
especially
to
mention
the
valuable
suggestions
that
i
have
received
from
carveth
read
to
whose
assistance
in
revising
the
present
edition
many
of
my
corrections
are
due
preface
to
the
third
edition
in
this
third
edition
i
have
again
made
extensive
alterations
and
introduced
a
considerable
amount
of
new
matter
some
of
these
changes
and
additions
are
due
to
modifications
of
my
own
ethical
or
psychological
views
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
these
are
of
great
importance
in
relation
to
the
main
subject
of
the
treatise
and
by
far
the
largest
part
of
the
new
matter
introduced
has
been
written
either
to
remove
obscurities
ambiguities
and
minor
inconsistencies
in
the
exposition
of
my
views
which
the
criticisms
of
others
or
my
own
reflection
have
enabled
me
to
discover
or
to
treat
as
fully
as
seemed
desirable
certain
parts
or
aspects
of
the
subject
which
i
had
either
passed
over
altogether
or
discussed
too
slightly
in
my
previous
editions
and
on
which
it
now
appears
to
me
important
to
explain
my
opinions

for
the
greater
completeness

of
the
subject

here
acknowledge
the
advantage
that
i
have
received
from
the
remarks
and
questions
of
my
pupils
and
from
criticisms
privately
communicated
to
me
by
others
among
these
latter
i
ought
especially
to
mention
an
instructive
examination
of
my
fundamental
doctrines
by
the
rev
hastings
rashdall
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
the
chief
alterations
in
this
fourth
edition
are
the
following
i
have
expanded
the
discussion
on
free
will
in
book
chap
to
meet
the
criticisms
of
fowler
in
his
of
and
martineau
in
his
of
ethical
in
consequence
of
the
publication
of
the
work
i
have
rewritten
part
of
chap
xii
of
book
which
deals
with
the
ethical
view
maintained
by
martineau
i
have
expanded
the
argument
in
book
iii
chap
to
meet
objections
ably
urged
by
rashdall
in
april
i
have
somewhat
altered
the
concluding
chapter
in
consequence
of
an
important
criticism
by
gizycki
für
wissenschaftliche
jahrg
iv
heft
i
which
i
had
inadvertently
overlooked
in
preparing
the
third
edition
several
pages
of
new
matter
have
thus
been
introduced
for
which
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
made
room
by
shortening
what
seemed
prolix
omitting
what
seemed
superfluous
and
relegating
digressions
to
notes
in
other
parts
of
the
work
so
that
the
bulk
of
the
whole
is
not
increased
for
the
index
which
forms
a
new
feature
in
the
present
edition
i
am
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
miss
jones
of
girton
college
the
author
of
of
logic
as
a
science
of
preface
to
the
fifth
edition
such
criticisms
of
my
ethical
opinions
and
reasonings
as
have
come
under
my
notice
since
the
publication
of
the
fourth
edition
of
this
treatise
have
chiefly
related
to
my
treatment
of
the
question
of
free
will
in
book
chap
or
to
the
hedonistic
view
of
ultimate
good
maintained
in
book
iii
chap
iv
i
have
accordingly
rewritten
certain
parts
of
these
two
chapters
in
the
hope
of
making
my
arguments
more
clear
and
convincing
in
each
case
a
slight
change
in
view
will
be
apparent
to
a
careful
reader
who
compares
the
present
with
the
preceding
edition
but
in
neither
case
does
the
change
affect
the
main
substance
of
the
argument
alterations
in
one
or
two
cases
not
inconsiderable
have
been
made
in
several
other
chapters
especially
book
chap
and
book
iii
chaps
and
ii
but
they
have
chiefly
aimed
at
removing
defects
of
exposition
and
do
not
i
think
in
any
case
imply
any
material
change
of
view
my
thanks
are
again
due
to
miss
jones
of
girton
college
for
reading
through
the
proofs
of
this
edition
and
making
most
useful
corrections
and
suggestions
as
well
as
for
revising
the
index
which
she
kindly
made
for
the
fourth
edition
preface
to
the
sixth
edition
the
revision
of
methods
of
for
this
edition
was
begun
by
professor
sidgwick
and
carried
through
by
him
up
to
on
which
the
last
of
his
corrections
on
the
copy
were
made
the
latter
portion
of
his
revision
was
done
under
the
pressure
of
severe
illness
the
increase
of
which
prevented
him
from
continuing
it
beyond
the
point
mentioned
and
by
the
calamity
of
his
death
the
rest
of
the
book
remains
without
the
final
touches
which
it
might
have
received
from
his
hand
in
accordance
with
his
wish
i
have
seen
pp
to
through
the
press
unchanged
except
for
a
few
small
alterations
which
he
had
indicated
and
the
insertion
on
pp
of
the
concluding
passage
of
book
iv
chapter
iii
such
alterations
as
were
made
by
professor
sidgwick
in
this
edition
prior
to
will
be
found
chiefly
in
chapters
and
ix
of
book
and
chapters
iii
and
vi
of
book
ii
the
appendix
on
the
kantian
conception
of
free
will
promised
in
note
on
of
this
edition
is
substantially
a
reprint
of
a
paper
by
professor
sidgwick
under
that
heading
which
appeared
in
vol
xiii
no
and
accurately
covers
the
ground
indicated
in
the
note
there
is
one
further
matter
of
importance
among
the
material
which
professor
sidgwick
intended
to
be
referred
to
in
preparing
this
edition
for
the
press
there
occurs
as
part
of
the
notes
for
a
lecture
a
brief
history
of
the
development
in
his
thought
of
the
ethical
view
which
he
has
set
forth
in
the
of
this
though
not
in
a
finished
condition
is
in
essentials
complete
and
coherent
and
since
it
can
not
fail
to
have
peculiar
value
and
interest
for
students
of
the
book
it
has
been
decided
to
insert
it
here
such
an
arrangement
seems
to
a
certain
extent
in
harmony
with
the
author
s
own
procedure
in
the
preface
to
the
second
edition
and
in
this
way
while
future
students
of
the
will
have
access
to
an
introductory
account
which
both
ethically
and
historically
is
of
very
exceptional
interest
no
dislocation
of
the
text
will
be
involved
in
the
account
referred
to
professor
sidgwick
says
my
first
adhesion
to
a
definite
ethical
system
was
to
the
utilitarianism
of
mill
i
found
in
this
relief
from
the
apparently
external
and
arbitrary
pressure
of
moral
rules
which
i
had
been
educated
to
obey
and
which
presented
themselves
to
me
as
to
some
extent
doubtful
and
confused
and
sometimes
even
when
clear
as
merely
dogmatic
unreasoned
incoherent
my
antagonism
to
this
was
intensified
by
the
study
of
whewell
s
of
which
was
prescribed
for
the
study
of
undergraduates
in
trinity
it
was
from
that
book
that
i
derived
the
impression
which
long
remained
uneffaced
that
intuitional
moralists
were
hopelessly
loose
as
compared
to
mathematicians
in
their
definitions
and
axioms
the
two
elements
of
mill
s
view
which
i
am
accustomed
to
distinguish
as
psychological
hedonism
that
each
man
does
seek
his
own
happiness
and
ethical
hedonism
that
each
man
ought
to
seek
the
general
happiness
both
attracted
me
and
i
did
not
at
first
perceive
their
incoherence
psychological
hedonism
the
law
of
universal
attracted
me
by
its
frank
naturalness
ethical
hedonism
as
expounded
by
mill
was
morally
inspiring
by
its
dictate
of
readiness
for
absolute
they
appealed
to
different
elements
of
my
nature
but
they
brought
these
into
apparent
harmony
they
both
used
the
same
words
pleasure
happiness
and
the
persuasiveness
of
mill
s
exposition
veiled
for
a
time
the
profound
discrepancy
between
the
natural
end
of
action
private
happiness
and
the
end
of
duty
general
happiness
or
if
a
doubt
assailed
me
as
to
the
coincidence
of
private
and
general
happiness
i
was
inclined
to
hold
that
it
ought
to
be
cast
to
the
winds
by
a
generous
resolution
but
a
sense
grew
upon
me
that
this
method
of
dealing
with
the
conflict
between
interest
and
duty
though
perhaps
proper
for
practice
could
not
be
final
for
philosophy
for
practical
men
who
do
not
philosophise
the
maxim
of
subordinating
as
commonly
conceived
to
altruistic
impulses
and
sentiments
which
they
feel
to
be
higher
and
nobler
is
i
doubt
not
a
commendable
maxim
but
it
is
surely
the
business
of
ethical
philosophy
to
find
and
make
explicit
the
rational
ground
of
such
action
i
therefore
set
myself
to
examine
methodically
the
relation
of
interest
and
duty
this
involved
a
careful
study
of
egoistic
method
to
get
the
relation
of
interest
and
duty
clear
let
us
suppose
that
my
own
interest
is
paramount
what
really
is
my
interest
how
far
can
acts
conducive
to
it
be
known
how
far
does
the
result
correspond
with
duty
or
wellbeing
of
mankind
this
investigation
led
me
to
feel
very
strongly
opposition
rather
than
that
which
mill
and
the
earlier
utilitarians
felt
between
intuitions
or
moral
sense
perceptions
and
hedonism
whether
epicurean
or
utilitarian
hence
the
arrangement
of
my
book
iv
book
ii
egoism
book
iii
intuitionism
book
iv
utilitarianism
the
result
was
that
i
concluded
that
no
complete
solution
of
the
conflict
between
my
happiness
and
the
general
happiness
was
possible
on
the
basis
of
mundane
experience
this
conclusion
i
slowly
and
reluctantly
accepted
cf
book
ii
chap
and
last
chapter
of
treatise
book
ii
chap
is
on
happiness
and
duty
and
the
concluding
chapter
is
on
the
mutual
relations
of
the
three
methods
this
was
most
important
to
me
in
consequence
of
this
perception
moral
choice
of
the
general
happiness
or
acquiescence
in
as
ultimate
became
practically
necessary
but
on
what
ground
i
put
aside
mill
s
phrases
that
such
sacrifice
was
heroic
that
it
was
not
well
with
me
unless
i
was
in
a
disposition
to
make
it
i
put
to
him
in
my
mind
the
dilemma
either
it
is
for
my
own
happiness
or
it
is
not
if
not
why
should
i
do
it
it
was
no
use
to
say
that
if
i
was
a
moral
hero
i
should
have
formed
a
habit
of
willing
actions
beneficial
to
others
which
would
remain
in
force
even
with
my
own
pleasure
in
the
other
scale
i
knew
that
at
any
rate
i
was
not
the
kind
of
moral
hero
who
does
this
without
reason
from
habit
nor
did
i
even
wish
to
be
that
kind
of
hero
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
kind
of
hero
however
admirable
was
certainly
not
a
philosopher
i
must
somehow
that
it
was
right
for
me
to
sacrifice
my
happiness
for
the
good
of
the
whole
of
which
i
am
a
part
thus
in
spite
of
my
early
aversion
to
intuitional
ethics
derived
from
the
study
of
whewell
and
in
spite
of
my
attitude
of
discipleship
to
mill
i
was
forced
to
recognise
the
need
of
a
fundamental
ethical
intuition
the
utilitarian
method
which
i
had
learnt
from
mill
could
not
it
seemed
to
me
be
made
coherent
and
harmonious
without
this
fundamental
intuition
in
this
state
of
mind
i
read
kant
s
ethics
again
i
had
before
read
it
somewhat
unintelligently
under
the
influence
of
mill
s
view
as
to
its
grotesque
i
now
read
it
more
receptively
and
was
impressed
with
the
truth
and
importance
of
its
fundamental
principle
from
a
principle
or
maxim
that
you
can
will
to
be
a
universal
cf
book
iii
chap
i
of
methods
of
it
threw
the
golden
rule
of
the
gospel
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
into
a
form
that
commended
itself
to
my
reason
kant
s
resting
of
morality
on
freedom
did
not
indeed
commend
itself
to
me
though
i
did
not
at
first
see
what
i
now
seem
to
see
clearly
that
it
involves
the
fundamental
confusion
of
using
freedom
in
two
distinct
senses
freedom
that
is
realised
only
when
we
do
right
when
reason
triumphs
over
inclination
and
freedom
that
is
realised
equally
when
we
choose
to
do
wrong
and
which
is
apparently
implied
in
the
notion
of
what
commended
itself
to
me
in
short
was
kant
s
ethical
principle
rather
than
its
metaphysical
basis
this
i
briefly
explain
in
book
iii
chap
i
of
methods
of
i
shall
go
into
it
at
more
length
when
we
come
to
kant
that
whatever
is
right
for
me
must
be
right
for
all
persons
in
similar
circumstances
which
was
the
form
in
which
i
accepted
the
kantian
maxim
seemed
to
me
certainly
fundamental
certainly
true
and
not
without
practical
importance
but
the
fundamental
principle
seemed
to
me
inadequate
for
the
construction
of
a
system
of
duties
and
the
more
i
reflected
on
it
the
more
inadequate
it
appeared
on
reflection
it
did
not
seem
to
me
really
to
meet
the
difficulty
which
had
led
me
from
mill
to
kant
it
did
not
settle
finally
the
subordination
of
to
duty
for
the
rational
egoist
a
man
who
had
learnt
from
hobbes
that
is
the
first
law
of
nature
and
the
only
rational
basis
of
social
morality
and
in
fact
its
actual
basis
so
far
as
it
is
effective
such
a
thinker
might
accept
the
kantian
principle
and
remain
an
egoist
he
might
say
i
quite
admit
that
when
the
painful
necessity
comes
for
another
man
to
choose
between
his
own
happiness
and
the
general
happiness
he
must
as
a
reasonable
being
prefer
his
own
it
is
right
for
him
to
do
this
on
my
principle
no
doubt
as
i
probably
do
not
sympathise
with
him
in
particular
any
more
than
with
other
persons
i
as
a
disengaged
spectator
should
like
him
to
sacrifice
himself
to
the
general
good
but
i
do
not
expect
him
to
do
it
any
more
than
i
should
do
it
myself
in
his
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
this
reasoning
could
be
effectively
confuted
no
doubt
it
was
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
universe
reasonable
to
prefer
the
greater
good
to
the
lesser
even
though
the
lesser
good
was
the
private
happiness
of
the
agent
still
it
seemed
to
me
also
undeniably
reasonable
for
the
individual
to
prefer
his
own
the
rationality
of
seemed
to
me
as
undeniable
as
the
rationality
of
i
could
not
give
up
this
conviction
though
neither
of
my
masters
neither
kant
nor
mill
seemed
willing
to
admit
it
in
different
ways
each
in
his
own
way
they
refused
to
admit
it
i
was
therefore
if
i
may
so
say
a
disciple
on
the
loose
in
search
of
a
master
or
if
the
term
master
be
too
strong
at
any
rate
i
sought
for
sympathy
and
support
in
the
conviction
which
i
had
attained
in
spite
of
the
opposite
opinions
of
the
thinkers
from
whom
i
had
learnt
most
it
was
at
this
point
then
that
the
influence
of
butler
came
in
for
the
stage
at
which
i
had
thus
arrived
in
search
of
an
ethical
creed
at
once
led
me
to
understand
butler
and
to
find
the
support
and
intellectual
sympathy
that
i
required
in
his
view
i
say
to
understand
him
for
hitherto
i
had
misunderstood
him
as
i
believe
most
people
then
misunderstood
and
perhaps
still
misunderstand
him
he
had
been
presented
to
me
as
an
advocate
of
the
authority
of
conscience
and
his
argument
put
summarily
seemed
to
be
that
because
reflection
on
our
impulses
showed
us
conscience
claiming
authority
therefore
we
ought
to
obey
it
well
i
had
no
doubt
that
my
conscience
claimed
authority
though
it
was
a
more
utilitarian
conscience
than
butler
s
for
through
all
this
search
for
principles
i
still
adhered
for
practical
purposes
to
the
doctrine
i
had
learnt
from
mill
i
still
held
to
the
maxim
of
aiming
at
the
general
happiness
as
the
supreme
directive
rule
of
conduct
and
i
thought
i
could
answer
the
objections
that
butler
brought
against
this
view
in
the
dissertation
on
virtue
at
the
end
of
the
my
difficulty
was
as
i
have
said
that
this
claim
of
conscience
whether
utilitarian
or
not
had
to
be
harmonised
with
the
claim
of
rational
and
that
i
vaguely
supposed
butler
to
avoid
or
override
the
latter
claim
but
reading
him
at
this
stage
with
more
care
i
found
in
him
with
pleasure
and
surprise
a
view
very
similar
to
that
which
had
developed
itself
in
my
own
mind
in
struggling
to
assimilate
mill
and
kant
i
found
he
expressly
admitted
that
interest
my
own
happiness
is
a
manifest
obligation
and
that
reasonable
is
one
of
the
two
chief
or
superior
principles
in
the
nature
of
man
that
is
he
recognised
a
dualism
of
the
governing
faculty
or
as
i
prefer
to
say
dualism
of
the
practical
reason
since
the
authority
on
which
butler
laid
stress
must
present
itself
to
my
mind
as
the
authority
of
reason
before
i
can
admit
it
of
this
more
presently
what
i
now
wish
to
make
clear
is
that
it
was
on
this
side
if
i
may
so
say
that
i
entered
into
butler
s
system
and
came
under
the
influence
of
his
powerful
and
cautious
intellect
but
the
effect
of
his
influence
carried
me
a
further
step
away
from
mill
for
i
was
led
by
it
to
abandon
the
doctrine
of
psychological
hedonism
and
to
recognise
the
existence
of
disinterested
or
impulses
to
action
impulses
not
directed
towards
the
agent
s
pleasure
cf
chap
iv
of
book
of
methods
of
in
fact
as
regards
what
i
may
call
a
psychological
basis
of
ethics
i
found
myself
much
more
in
agreement
with
butler
than
mill
and
this
led
me
to
reconsider
my
relation
to
intuitional
ethics
the
strength
and
vehemence
of
butler
s
condemnation
of
pure
utilitarianism
in
so
cautious
a
writer
naturally
impressed
me
much
and
i
had
myself
become
as
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
an
intuitionist
to
a
certain
extent
for
the
supreme
rule
of
aiming
at
the
general
happiness
as
i
had
come
to
see
must
rest
on
a
fundamental
moral
intuition
if
i
was
to
recognise
it
as
binding
at
all
and
in
reading
the
writings
of
the
earlier
english
intuitionists
more
and
clarke
i
found
the
axiom
i
required
for
my
utilitarianism
that
a
rational
agent
is
bound
to
aim
at
universal
happiness
in
one
form
or
another
holding
a
prominent
place
cf
of
pp
i
had
then
theoretically
as
well
as
practically
accepted
this
fundamental
moral
intuition
and
there
was
also
the
kantian
principle
which
i
recognised
as
irresistibly
valid
though
not
adequate
to
give
complete
i
was
then
an
intuitional
moralist
to
this
extent
and
if
so
why
not
further
the
orthodox
moralists
such
as
whewell
then
in
vogue
said
that
there
was
a
whole
intelligible
system
of
intuitions
but
how
were
they
to
be
learnt
i
could
not
accept
butler
s
view
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
a
plain
man
s
conscience
for
it
appeared
to
me
that
plain
men
agreed
rather
verbally
than
really
in
this
state
of
mind
i
had
to
read
aristotle
again
and
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
upon
me
as
to
the
meaning
and
drift
of
his
procedure
especially
in
books
iv
of
the
cf
of
chap
ii
read
to
end
of
section
what
he
gave
us
there
was
the
common
sense
morality
of
greece
reduced
to
consistency
by
careful
comparison
given
not
as
something
external
to
him
but
as
what
we
he
and
others
think
ascertained
by
reflection
and
was
not
this
really
the
socratic
induction
elicited
by
interrogation
might
i
not
imitate
this
do
the
same
for
morality
here
and
now
in
the
same
manner
of
impartial
reflection
on
current
opinion
indeed
i
not
to
do
this
before
deciding
on
the
question
whether
i
had
or
had
not
a
system
of
moral
intuitions
at
any
rate
the
result
would
be
useful
whatever
conclusion
i
came
to
so
this
was
the
part
of
my
book
first
written
book
chaps
and
a
certain
imitation
of
aristotle
s
manner
was
very
marked
in
it
at
first
and
though
i
have
tried
to
remove
it
where
it
seemed
to
me
affected
or
pedantic
it
still
remains
to
some
extent
but
the
result
of
the
examination
was
to
bring
out
with
fresh
force
and
vividness
the
difference
between
the
maxims
of
common
sense
morality
even
the
strongest
and
strictest
veracity
and
good
faith
and
the
intuitions
which
i
had
already
attained
the
kantian
principle
of
which
i
now
saw
the
only
certain
element
in
justice
treat
similar
cases
similarly
to
be
a
particular
application
and
the
fundamental
principle
of
utilitarianism
and
this
latter
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
kantian
principle
i
certainly
could
will
it
to
be
a
universal
law
that
men
should
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
promote
universal
happiness
in
fact
it
was
the
only
law
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
me
that
i
could
thus
decisively
will
from
a
universal
point
of
view
i
was
then
a
utilitarian
again
but
on
an
intuitional
basis
but
further
the
reflection
on
common
sense
morality
which
i
had
gone
through
had
continually
brought
home
to
me
its
character
as
a
system
of
rules
tending
to
the
promotion
of
general
happiness
cf
of
pp
also
the
previous
reflection
on
hedonistic
method
for
book
ii
had
shown
me
its
weaknesses
what
was
then
to
be
done
the
conservative
attitude
to
be
observed
towards
common
sense
is
given
in
chapter
of
book
iv
adhere
generally
deviate
and
attempt
reform
only
in
exceptional
cases
in
which
notwithstanding
the
roughness
of
hedonistic
method
the
argument
against
common
sense
is
in
this
state
of
mind
i
published
my
book
i
tried
to
say
what
i
had
found
that
the
opposition
between
utilitarianism
and
intuitionism
was
due
to
a
misunderstanding
there
was
indeed
a
fundamental
opposition
between
the
individual
s
interest
and
either
morality
which
i
could
not
solve
by
any
method
i
had
yet
found
trustworthy
without
the
assumption
of
the
moral
government
of
the
world
so
far
i
agreed
with
both
butler
and
kant
but
i
could
find
no
real
opposition
between
intuitionism
and
utilitarianism
the
utilitarianism
of
mill
and
bentham
seemed
to
me
to
want
a
basis
that
basis
could
only
be
supplied
by
a
fundamental
intuition
on
the
other
hand
the
best
examination
i
could
make
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
showed
me
no
clear
and
principles
except
such
as
were
perfectly
consistent
with
utilitarianism
still
investigation
of
the
utilitarian
method
led
me
to
see
defects
in
it
the
merely
empirical
examination
of
the
consequences
of
actions
is
unsatisfactory
and
being
thus
conscious
of
the
practical
imperfection
in
many
cases
of
the
guidance
of
the
utilitarian
calculus
i
remained
anxious
to
treat
with
respect
and
make
use
of
the
guidance
afforded
by
common
sense
in
these
cases
on
the
ground
of
the
general
presumption
which
evolution
afforded
that
moral
sentiments
and
opinions
would
point
to
conduct
conducive
to
general
happiness
though
i
could
not
admit
this
presumption
as
a
ground
for
overruling
a
strong
probability
of
the
opposite
derived
from
utilitarian

ethics
is
a
department
of
the
theory
or
study
of
practice
it
is
the
study
of
what
ought
to
be
so
far
as
this
depends
upon
the
voluntary
action
of
individuals
in
deciding
what
they
ought
to
do
men
naturally
proceed
on
different
principles
and
by
different
methods
there
are
two
rational
ends
excellence
or
perfection
and
happiness
of
which
the
latter
at
least
may
be
sought
for
oneself
or
universally
it
is
also
commonly
thought
that
certain
rules
are
prescribed
without
reference
to
ulterior
consequences
the
methods
corresponding
to
these
different
principles
reduce
themselves
in
the
main
to
three
egoism
intuitionism
utilitarianism
these
methods
we
are
to
examine
separately
abstracting
them
from
ordinary
thought
where
we
find
them
in
confused
combination
and
developing
them
as
precisely
and
consistently
as
possible

ethics
and
politics
in
considering
the
relation
between
ethics
and
politics
we
have
to
distinguish
between
positive
law
and
ideal
law
but
at
any
rate
the
primary
object
of
ethics
is
not
to
determine
what
ought
to
be
done
in
an
ideal
society
it
therefore
does
not
necessarily
require
as
a
preliminary
the
theoretical
construction
of
such
a
society

ethical
judgments
by
reasonable
conduct
whether
morally
or
prudentially
reasonable
we
mean
that
of
which
we
judge
that
it
ought
to
be
done
such
a
judgment
can
not
be
legitimately
interpreted
as
a
judgment
concerning
facts
nor
as
referring
exclusively
to
the
to
ulterior
ends
in
particular
the
term
ought
as
used
in
moral
judgments
does
not
merely
signify
that
the
person
judging
feels
a
specific
emotion
nor
does
it
merely
signify
that
the
conduct
in
question
is
prescribed
under
penalties
the
notion
expressed
by
ought
in
its
strictest
ethical
use
is
too
elementary
to
admit
of
formal
definition
or
of
resolution
into
simpler
notions
it
is
assumed
to
be
objectively
valid
and
judgments
in
which
it
is
used
when
they
relate
to
the
future
conduct
of
the
person
judging
are
accompanied
by
a
special
kind
of
impulse
to
action
this
dictate
of
reason
is
also
exemplified
by
merely
prudential
judgments
and
by
merely
hypothetical
imperatives
chapter
iv
pleasure
and
desire
the
psychological
doctrine
that
the
object
of
desire
is
always
pleasure
is
liable
to
collide
with
the
view
of
ethical
judgments
just
given
and
in
any
case
deserves
careful
examination
if
by
pleasure
is
meant
agreeable
feeling
this
doctrine
is
opposed
to
experience
for
throughout
the
whole
scale
of
our
desires
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
we
can
distinguish
impulses
directed
towards
other
ends
than
our
own
feelings
from
the
desire
of
pleasure
as
is
further
shown
by
the
occasional
conflict
between
the
two
kinds
of
impulse
nor
can
the
doctrine
derive
any
real
support
from
consideration
either
of
the
unconscious
or
the
original
aim
of
human
action
note
chapter
v
free
will
the
kantian
identification
of
free
and
rational
action
is
misleading
from
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
when
by
definition
and
analysis
of
voluntary
action
the
issue
in
the
free
will
controversy
has
been
made
clear
it
appears
that
the
cumulative
argument
for
determinism
is
almost
overwhelming
still
it
is
impossible
to
me
in
acting
not
to
regard
myself
as
free
to
do
what
i
judge
to
be
reasonable
however
the
solution
of
the
metaphysical
question
of
free
will
is
not
important
theology
apart
for
systematic
ethics
generally
it
seems
however
to
have
a
special
relation
to
the
notion
of
justice
the
practical
unimportance
of
the
question
of
free
will
becomes
more
clear
if
we
scrutinize
closely
the
range
of
volitional

ethical
principles
and
methods
the
methods
indicated

other
principles
seem
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
made

reduce
themselves
to
these

the

of

short
all
varieties
of

conveniently
be
classed
under
three
heads
intuitionism

the
two
kinds
of

egoism
and
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
what
is
commonly
known
as
egoism
we
must
distinguish
and
exclude
several
possible
meanings
of
the
term
and
define
its
end
as
the
greatest
attainable
surplus
of
pleasure
over

being

to

intuitionism
i
apply
the
term
intuitional
in
the
narrower
of
two
legitimate
senses
to
distinguish
a
method
in
which
the
rightness
of
some
kinds
of
action
is
assumed
to
be
known
without
consideration
of
ulterior
consequences
the
common
antithesis
between
intuitive
and
inductive
is
inexact
since
this
method
does
not
necessarily
proceed
from
the
universal
to
the
particular
we
may
distinguish
perceptional
intuitionism
according
to
which
it
is
always
the
rightness
of
some
particular
action
that
is
held
to
be
immediately
known
dogmatic
intuitionism
in
which
the
general
rules
of
common
sense
are
accepted
as
axiomatic
philosophical
intuitionism
which
attempts
to
find
a
deeper
explanation
for
these
current
rules
note
chapter
ix
good
another
important
variety
of
intuitionism
is
constituted
by
substituting
for
right
the
wider
notion
the
common
judgment
that
a
thing
is
good
does
not
on
reflection
appear
to
be
equivalent
to
a
judgment
that
it
is
directly
or
indirectly
pleasant
good
desirable
or
reasonably
desired
as
applied
to
conduct
the
term
does
not
convey
so
definite
a
dictate
as
right
and
it
is
not
confined
to
the
strictly
voluntary
there
are
many
other
things
commonly
judged
to
be
good
but
reflection
shows
that
nothing
is
ultimately
good
except
some
mode
of
human
existence

egoism
chapter
i
the
principle
and
method
of
egoism
the
principle
of
egoistic
hedonism
is
the
widely
accepted
proposition
that
the
rational
end
of
conduct
for
each
individual
is
the
maximum
of
his
own
happiness
or
pleasure
there
are
several
methods
of
seeking
this
end
but
we
may
take
as
primary
that
which
proceeds
by
comparison
of
pleasures
chapter
ii
empirical
hedonism
in
this
method
it
is
assumed
that
all
pleasures
sought
and
pains
shunned
are
commensurable
and
can
be
arranged
in
a
certain
scale
of
preferableness
pleasure
being
defined
as
feeling
apprehended
as
desirable
by
the
sentient
individual
at
the
time
of
feeling
note
chapter
iii
empirical
hedonism
to
get
a
clearer
view
of
this
method
let
us
consider
objections
tending
to
show
its
inherent
impracticability
as
first
that
pleasure
as
feeling
can
not
be
conceived
and
that
a
sum
of
pleasures
is
intrinsically
unmeaning
that
transient
pleasures
can
not
satisfy
and
that
the
predominance
of
tends
to
defeat
its
own
end
that
the
habit
of
introspectively
comparing
pleasures
is
unfavourable
to
pleasure
that
any
quantitative
comparison
of
pleasures
and
pains
is
vague
and
uncertain
even
in
the
case
of
our
own
past
experiences
that
it
also
tends
to
be
different
at
different
times
especially
through
variations
in
the
present
state
of
the
person
performing
the
comparison
that
in
fact
the
supposed
definite
commensurability
of
pleasures
is
an
unverifiable
assumption
that
there
is
a
similar
liability
to
error
in
appropriating
the
experience
of
others
and
in
inferring
future
pleasures
from
past

iv
objective
hedonism
and
common
sense
it
may
seem
that
the
judgments
of
common
sense
respecting
the
sources
of
happiness
offer
a
refuge
from
the
uncertainties
of
empirical
hedonism
but
there
are
several
fundamental
defects
in
this
refuge
and
these
judgments
when
closely
examined
are
found
to
be
perplexingly
inconsistent
still
we
may
derive
from
them
a
certain
amount
of
practical
guidance

happiness
and
duty
it
has
been
thought
possible
to
prove
on
empirical
grounds
that
one
s
greatest
happiness
is
always
attained
by
the
performance
of
duty
but
no
such
complete
coincidence
seems
to
result
from
a
consideration
either
of
the
legal
sanctions
of
duty
or
of
the
social
sanctions
or
of
the
internal
sanctions
even
if
we
consider
not
merely
isolated
acts
of
duty
but
a
virtuous
life
as
a
whole

deductive
hedonism
hedonistic
method
must
ultimately
rest
on
facts
of
empirical
observation
but
it
might
become
largely
deductive
through
scientific
knowledge
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
but
we
have
no
practically
available
general
theory
of
these
causes
either
psychophysical
or
biological
nor
can
the
principle
of
increasing
life
or
that
of
aiming
at
or
that
of
giving
free
play
to
impulse
be
so
defined
as
to
afford
us
any
practical
guidance
to
the
end

falling
back
on

intuitionism
chapter
i
intuitionism
the
fundamental
assumption
of
intuitionism
is
that
we
have
the
power
of
seeing
clearly
what
actions
are
in
themselves
right
and
reasonable
though
many
actions
are
commonly
judged
to
be
made
better
or
worse
through
the
presence
of
certain
our
common
judgments
of
right
and
wrong
relate
strictly
speaking
to
one
motive
indeed
the
desire
to
do
what
is
right
as
such
has
been
thought
an
essential
condition
to
right
conduct
but
the
intuitional
method
should
be
treated
as
not
involving
this
assumption
it
is
certainly
an
essential
condition
that
we
should
not
believe
the
act
to
be
wrong
and
this
implies
that
we
should
not
believe
it
to
be
wrong
for
any
similar
person
in
similar
circumstances
but
this
implication
though
it
may
supply
a
valuable
practical
rule
can
not
furnish
a
complete
criterion
of
right
conduct
the
of
apparent
cognitions
of
right
conduct
intuitively
obtained
as
distinct
from
their
validity
will
scarcely
be
questioned
and
to
establish
their
validity
it
is
not
needful
to
prove
their
both
particular
and
universal
intuitions
are
found
in
our
common
moral
thought
but
it
is
for
the
latter
that
ultimate
validity
is
ordinarily
claimed
by
intuitional
moralists
we
must
try
by
reflecting
on
common
sense
how
far
we
can
state
these
moral
axioms
with
clearness
and
precision
chapter

virtue
and
duty
duties
are
right
acts
for
the
adequate
performance
of
which

the
performance

in

for
the

of

virtues
the
presence
of
certain
emotions
seems
necessary
it
may
be
said
that
moral
excellence
like

eludes

the

of

of
different

methods

of
which
and
not
one

than
another
the

is
commonly

to
aim
at
and
attain
as
far
as
circumstances
admit
the
will
is
to
some
extent
involved
in
forming
wise
decisions
but
more
clearly
in
acting
on
them
whatever
we
may
call
the
virtue
thus
manifested
of
minor
intellectual
excellences
some
are
not
strictly
virtues
others
are
such
as

which
affections
which
are

virtues
prompt
to
kind
services
rules
for
the
distribution
of
kindness
are
needed
as
claims
may
conflict
but
clearly

rules
can
not
be
obtained
from
common
sense
in
a
definite
form
nor
clear
principles
from
which

may
be
deduced
as
is
seen
when
we
examine
the
duties
to
kinsmen
as
commonly
conceived

the
wider
duties
of

universal
benevolence

justice
is
especially
difficult
to
define
the
just
can
not
be
identified
with
the
legal
as
laws
may
be
unjust
again
the
justice
of
laws
does
not
consist
merely
in
the
absence
of
arbitrary
inequality
in
framing
or
administering
them
one
element
of
justice
seems
to
consist
in
the
fulfilment
of
contracts
and
definite
understandings
and
expectations
arising
naturally
out
of
the
established
order
of
society
but
the
duty
of
fulfilling
these
latter
is
somewhat
indefinite
and
this
social
order
may
itself
from
another
point
of
view
be
condemned
as
unjust
that
is
as
tried
by
the
standard
of
ideal
justice
what
then
is
this
standard
we
seem
to
find
various
degrees
and
forms
of
it
one
view
of
ideal
law
states
freedom
as
its
absolute
end
but
the
attempt
to
construct
a
system
of
law
on
this
principle
involves
us
in
insuperable
difficulties
nor
does
the
realisation
of
freedom
satisfy
our
common
conception
of
ideal
justice
the
principle
of
this
is
rather
that
desert
should
be
but
the
application
of
this
principle
is
again
very
perplexing
whether
we
try
to
determine
good
desert
or
the
worth
of
services
or
ill
desert
in
order
to
realise

remains

laws

the
duty
of
obeying
laws
though
it
may
to
a
great
extent
be
included
under
justice
still
requires
a
separate
treatment
we
can
however
obtain
no
for
any
precise
definition
of
it
for
we
are
neither
agreed
as
to
what
kind
of
government
is
ideally
legitimate
nor
as
to
the
criterion
of
a
traditionally
legitimate
government
nor
as
to
the
proper
limits
of
governmental
authority
the
duty
of
fulfilling
a
promise
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
understood
by
both
promiser
and
promisee
is
thought
to
be
peculiarly
stringent
and
certain
it
being
admitted
that
its
obligation
is
relative
to
the
promisee
and
may
be
annulled
by
him
and
that
it
can
not
override
strict
prior
obligations
but
common
sense
seems
to
doubt
how
far
a
promise
is
binding
when
it
has
been
obtained
by
force
or
fraud
or
when
circumstances
have
materially
altered
since
it
was
made
especially
if
it
be
a
promise
to
the
dead
or
absent
from
which
no
release
can
be
obtained
or
if
the
performance
of
the
promise
will
be
harmful
to
the
promisee
or
inflict
a
disproportionate
sacrifice
on
the
promiser
other
doubts
arise
when
a
promise
has
been
misapprehended

the
characteristic
is
that
it
lays
down
certain
absolute

independent
rules
such
as
the

common

after
all
scarcely
seems
to

nor
to
decide
clearly
whether
the
beliefs
which
we
are

to
make

are
those
directly
produced
by
our
words

the
immediate
inferences
from
these

is
said
that
the

allowance
of
unveracity
would
be
suicidal
as
no
one
would

falsehood
but
this
argument
though
forcible
is
not
decisive
for
this
result
may
be
in

the

this
as

applied
to

under

as

we
seem

review
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
we
have
now
to
examine
the
moral
maxims
that
have
been
defined
to
ascertain
whether
they
possess
the
characteristics
of
scientific
intuitions
we
require
of
an
axiom
that
it
should
be
stated
in
clear
and
precise
terms
really
not
conflicting
with
any
other
truth
supported
by
an
adequate
consensus
of
these
characteristics
are
not
found
in
the
moral
maxims
of
common
sense
the
maxims
of
wisdom
and
are
only
in
so
far
as
they
are
tautological
nor
can
we
state
any
clear
absolute
axioms
for
determining
the
duties
of
the
affections
and
as
for
the
group
of
principles
that
were
extracted
from
the
common
notion
of
justice
we
can
not
define
each
singly
in
a
satisfactory
manner
still
less
reconcile
them
and
even
the
duty
of
good
faith
when
we
consider
the
numerous
qualifications
of
it
more
or
less
doubtfully
admitted
by
common
sense
seems
more
like
a
subordinate
rule
than
an
independent
first
principle
still
more
is
this
the
case
with
veracity
similarly
with
other
virtues
even
the
prohibition
of
suicide
so
far
as
rational
seems
to
rest
ultimately
on
utilitarian
grounds
even
purity
when
we
force
ourselves
to
examine
it
rigorously
yields
no
clear
independent
principle
the
common
moral
maxims
are
adequate
for
practical
guidance
but
do
not
admit
of

elevated

motives
or
springs
of
action
as
subjects
of
moral
judgment
it
has
been
held
by
several
moralists
that
the
universal
conscience
judges
primarily
not
of
rightness
of
acts
but
of
rank
of
motives
if
however
we
include
the
moral
sentiments
among
these
motives
this
latter
view
involves
all
the
difficulties

perplexities
of
the
former
yet
it
is
paradoxical
to
omit
these
sentiments
but
even
if
we
leave
these
out
we
still
find
very
little
agreement
as
to
rank
of
motives
and
there
is
a
special
difficulty
arising
from
complexity
of

does

seem
to
hold
that

be
preferred

philosophical
intuitionism
the
philosopher
as
such
attempts
to
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
of
common
sense
to
some
deeper
principles
but
has
too
often
presented
to
the
world
as
the
result
of
his
investigation
tautological
propositions
and
vicious
circles
still
there
are
certain
abstract
moral
principles
of
real
importance
intuitively
known
though
they
are
not
sufficient
by
themselves
to
give
complete
practical
guidance
thus
we
can
exhibit
a
element
in
the
commonly
recognised
principles
of
prudence
justice
and
benevolence
this
is
confirmed
by
a
reference
to
clarke
s
and
kant
s
systems
and
also
to
utilitarianism
which
needs
for
its

a
principle

ultimate
good
the
notion
of
virtue
as
commonly
conceived
can
not
without
a
logical
circle
be
identified
with
the
notion
of
ultimate
good
nor
is
it
in
accordance
with
common
sense
to
regard
subjective
rightness
of
will
or
other
elements
of
perfection
as
constituting
ultimate
good
what
is

or

must
be

consciousness
either
simply
happiness
or
certain
objective
relations
of
the
conscious
mind
when
these
alternatives
are
fairly
presented
common
sense
seems
disposed
to
choose
the
former
especially
as
we
can
now
explain
its
instinctive
disinclination
to
admit
pleasure
as
ultimate
end
while
the
other
alternative
leaves
us

of

the

called

be
carefully
distinguished
from
egoistic
hedonism
and
also
from
any

theory

to
the
nature
and
origin
of
the

has
been

but
the

its
application

it
exhibited
the
essence
of
the
utilitarian
principle
as

sense
taking
as
our

hume
s
exhibition
of
the

as
felicific
qualities
of
character
we
can
trace
a
complex
coincidence
between
utilitarianism
and
common
sense
it
is
not
needful
nor
does
it
even
help
the
argument
to
show
this
coincidence
to
be
perfect
and
exact
we
may
observe
first
that
dispositions
may
often
be
admired
as
generally
felicific
when
the
special
acts
that
have
resulted
from
them
are
infelicific
again
the
maxims
of
many
virtues
are
found
to
contain
an
explicit
or
implicit
reference
to
duty
conceived
as
already
determinate
passing
over
these
to
examine
the
more
definite
among
common
notions
of
duty
we
observe
first
how
the
rules
that
prescribe
the
distribution
of
kindness
in
accordance
with
normal
promptings
of
family
affections
friendship
gratitude
and
pity
have
a
firm
utilitarian
basis
and
how
utilitarianism
is
naturally
referred
to
for
an
explanation
of
the
difficulties
that
arise
in
attempting
to
define
these
rules
a
similar
result
is
reached
by
an
examination
singly
and
together
of
the
different
elements
into
which
we
have
analysed
the
common
notion
of
justice
and
in
the
case
of
other
virtues
purity
has
been
thought
an
exception
but
a
careful
examination
of
common
opinions
as
to
the
regulation
of
sexual
relations
exhibits
a
peculiarly
complex
and
delicate
correspondence
between
moral
sentiments
and
social
utilities
the
hypothesis
that
the
moral
sense
is
unconsciously
utilitarian
also
accounts
for
the
actual
differences
in
different
codes
of
duty
and
estimates
of
virtue
either
in
the
same
age
and
country
or
when
we
compare
different
ages
and
countries
it
is
not
maintained
that
perception
of
rightness
has
always
been
consciously
derived
from
perception
of
utility
a
view
which
the
evidence
of
history
fails
to
support
on
the
utilitarian
view
the
relation
between
ethics
and
politics
is
different
for
different
parts
of
the
legal
code

a
utilitarian
then
to
accept
the

of

provisionally
as
a
body
of
utilitarian
doctrine
not
quite
for
even
accepting
the
theory
that
the
moral
sense
is
derived
from
sympathy
we
can
discern
several
causes
that
must
have
operated
to
produce
a
divergence
between
common
sense
and
a
perfectly
utilitarian
code
of
morality
at
the

time
it
seems
idle
to
try

construct

in
any
other
way
than
by
taking
positive
morality
as

basis

only
one
that

can
at

use

finally
determine
the
nature

extent
of
this
rectification
his
innovations
may
be
either
negative
and
destructive
or
positive
and
supplementary
there
are
certain
important
general
reasons
against
an
innovation
of
the
former
kind
which
may
in
any
given
case
easily
outweigh
the
special
arguments
in
its
favour
generally
a
utilitarian
in
recommending
by
example
or
precept
a
deviation
from
an
established
rule
of
conduct
desires
his
innovation
to
be
generally
imitated
but
in
some
cases
he
may
neither
expect
nor
desire
such
imitation
though
cases
of
this
kind
are
rare
and
difficult
to
determine
there
are
no
similar
difficulties
in
the
way
of
modifying

the
mutual
relations
of

it

can
we
reconcile
egoistic

far
as
the
latter
coincides
with
common
sense

have
seen
in

that
no

reconciliation
is
possible
on
the

nor
does
a
fuller

utilitarian
sanction
lead
us
to
modify
this
conclusion
in
spite
of
the
importance
that
is
undoubtedly
to
be
attached
to
sympathetic
pleasures
the
religious
sanction
if
we
can
show
that
it
is
actually
attached
to
the
utilitarian
code
is
of
course
adequate
but
its
existence
can
not
be
demonstrated
by

arguments

view
distinguished
from
positive
sciences
by
having
as
their
special
and
primary
object
to
determine
what
ought
to
be
and
not
to
ascertain
what
merely
is
has
been
or
will
be
the
student
of
ethics
seeks
to
attain
systematic
and
precise
general
knowledge
of
what
ought
to
be
and
in
this
sense
his
aims
and
methods
may
properly
be
termed
scientific
but
i
have
preferred
to
call
ethics
a
study
rather
than
a
science
because
it
is
widely
thought
that
a
science
must
necessarily
have
some
department
of
actual
existence
for
its
and
in
fact
the
term
ethical
science
might
without
violation
of
usage
denote
either
the
department
of
psychology
that
deals
with
voluntary
action
and
its
springs
and
with
moral
sentiments
and
judgments
as
actual
phenomena
of
individual
human
minds
or
the
department
of
sociology
dealing
with
similar
phenomena
as
manifested
by
normal
members
of
the
organised
groups
of
human
beings
which
we
call
societies
we
observe
however
that
most
persons
do
not
pursue
either
of
these
studies
merely
from
curiosity
in
order
to
ascertain
what
actually
exists
has
existed
or
will
exist
in
time
they
commonly
wish
not
only
to
understand
human
action
but
also
to
regulate
it
in
this
view
they
apply
the
ideas
good
and
bad
right
and
wrong
to
the
conduct
or
institutions
which
they
describe
and
thus
pass
as
i
should
say
from
the
point
of
view
of
psychology
or
sociology
to
that
of
ethics
or
politics
my
definition
of
ethics
is
designed
to
mark
clearly
the
fundamental
importance
of
this
transition
it
is
true
that
the
mutual
implication
of
the
two
kinds
of
study
the
positive
and
the
practical
is
on
any
theory
very
close
and
complete
on
any
theory
our
view
of
what
ought
to
be
must
be
largely
derived
in
details
from
our
apprehension
of
what
is
the
means
of
realising
our
ideal
can
only
be
thoroughly
learnt
by
a
careful
study
of
actual
phenomena
and
to
any
individual
asking
himself
what
ought
i
to
do
or
aim
at
it
is
important
to
examine
the
answers
which
his
have
actually
given
to
similar
questions
still
it
seems
clear
that
an
attempt
to
ascertain
the
general
laws
or
uniformities
by
which
the
varieties
of
human
conduct
and
of
men
s
sentiments
and
judgments
respecting
conduct
may
be
is
essentially
different
from
an
attempt
to
determine
which
among
these
varieties
of
conduct
is
and
which
of
these
divergent
judgments
it
is
then
the
systematic
consideration
of
these
latter
questions
which
constitutes
in
my
view
the
special
and
distinct
aim
of
ethics
and
politics
in
the
language
of
the
preceding
section
i
could
not
avoid
taking
account
of
two
different
forms
in
which
the
fundamental
problem
of
ethics
is
stated
the
difference
between
which
leads
as
we
shall
presently
see
to
rather
important
consequences
ethics
is
sometimes
considered
as
an
investigation
of
the
true
moral
laws
or
rational
precepts
of
conduct
sometimes
as
an
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
ultimate
end
of
reasonable
human
action
the
good
or
true
good
of
man
and
the
method
of
attaining
it
both
these
views
are
familiar
and
will
have
to
be
carefully
considered
but
the
former
seems
most
prominent
in
modern
ethical
thought
and
most
easily
applicable
to
modern
ethical
systems
generally
for
the
good
investigated
in
ethics
is
limited
to
good
in
some
degree
attainable
by
human
effort
accordingly
knowledge
of
the
end
is
sought
in
order
to
ascertain
what
actions
are
the
right
means
to
its
attainment
thus
however
prominent
the
notion
of
an
ultimate
good
other
than
voluntary
action
of
any
kind
may
be
in
an
ethical
system
and
whatever
interpretation
may
be
given
to
this
notion
we
must
still
arrive
finally
if
it
is
to
be
practically
useful
at
some
determination
of
precepts
or
directive
rules
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand
the
conception
of
ethics
as
essentially
an
investigation
of
the
ultimate
good
of
man
and
the
means
of
attaining
it
is
not
universally
applicable
without
straining
to
the
view
of
morality
which
we
may
conveniently
distinguish
as
the
intuitional
view
according
to
which
conduct
is
held
to
be
right
when
conformed
to
certain
precepts
or
principles
of
duty
intuitively
known
to
be
unconditionally
binding
in
this
view
the
conception
of
ultimate
good
is
not
necessarily
of
fundamental
importance
in
the
determination
of
right
conduct
except
on
the
assumption
that
right
conduct
itself
or
the
character
realised
in
and
developed
through
right
conduct
is
the
sole
ultimate
good
for
man
but
this
assumption
is
not
implied
in
the
intuitional
view
of
ethics
nor
would
it
i
conceive
accord
with
the
moral
common
sense
of
modern
christian
communities
for
we
commonly
think
that
the
complete
notion
of
human
good
or
must
include
the
attainment
of
happiness
as
well
as
the
performance
of
duty
even
if
we
hold
with
butler
that
the
happiness
of
the
world
is
the
concern
of
him
who
is
the
lord
and
the
proprietor
of
it
and
that
accordingly
it
is
not
right
for
men
to
make
their
performance
of
duty
conditional
on
their
knowledge
of
its
conduciveness
to
their
happiness
for
those
who
hold
this
what
men
ought
to
take
as
the
ultimate
end
of
their
action
and
standard
of
right
conduct
may
in
some
cases
have
no
logical
connexion
with
the
conception
of
ultimate
good
for
man
so
that
in
such
cases
however
indispensable
this
latter
conception
may
be
to
the
completeness
of
an
ethical
system
it
would
still
not
be
important
for
the
methodical
determination
of
right
conduct
it
is
on
account
of
the
prevalence
of
the
intuitional
view
just
mentioned
and
the
prominent
place
which
it
consequently
occupies
in
my
discussion
that
in
defining
ethics
i
have
avoided
the
term
art
of
conduct
which
some
would
regard
as
its
more
appropriate
designation
for
the
term
art
when
applied
to
the
contents
of
a
treatise
seems
to
signify
systematic
express
knowledge
as
distinguished
from
the
implicit
knowledge
or
organised
habit
which
we
call
skill
of
the
right
means
to
a
given
end
now
if
we
assume
that
the
rightness
of
action
depends
on
its
conduciveness
to
some
ulterior
end
then
no
doubt
when
this
end
has
been
clearly
ascertained
the
process
of
determining
the
right
rules
of
conduct
for
human
beings
in
different
relations
and
circumstances
would
naturally
come
under
the
notion
of
art
but
on
the
view
that
the
practically
ultimate
end
of
moral
action
is
often
the
rightness
of
the
action
itself
or
the
virtue
realised
in
and
confirmed
by
such
action
and
that
this
is
known
intuitively
in
each
case
or
class
of
cases
we
can
hardly
regard
the
term
art
as
properly
applicable
to
the
systematisation
of
such
knowledge
hence
as
i
do
not
wish
to
start
with
any
assumption
incompatible
with
this
latter
view
i
prefer
to
consider
ethics
as
the
science
or
study
of
what
is
right
or
what
ought
to
be
so
far
as
this
depends
upon
the
voluntary
action
of
individuals
if
however
this
view
of
the
scope
of
ethics
is
accepted
the
question
arises
why
it
is
commonly
taken
to
consist
to
a
great
extent
of
psychological
discussion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
moral
faculty
especially
as
i
have
myself
thought
it
right
to
include
some
discussion
of
this
kind
in
the
present
treatise
for
it
does
not
at
first
appear
why
this
should
belong
to
ethics
any
more
than
discussions
about
the
mathematical
faculty
or
the
faculty
of
belong
to
mathematics
and
physics
respectively
why
do
we
not
simply
start
with
certain
premises
stating
what
ought
to
be
done
or
sought
without
considering
the
faculty
by
which
we
apprehend
their
truth
one
answer
is
that
the
moralist
has
a
practical
aim
we
desire
knowledge
of
right
conduct
in
order
to
act
on
it
now
we
can
not
help
believing
what
we
see
to
be
true
but
we
can
help
doing
what
we
see
to
be
right
or
wise
and
in
fact
often
do
what
we
know
to
be
wrong
or
unwise
thus
we
are
forced
to
notice
the
existence
in
us
of
irrational
springs
of
action
conflicting
with
our
knowledge
and
preventing
its
practical
realisation
and
the
very
imperfectness
of
the
connexion
between
our
practical
judgment
and
our
will
impels
us
to
seek
for
more
precise
knowledge
as
to
the
nature
of
that
connexion
but
this
is
not
all
men
never
ask
why
should
i
believe
what
i
see
to
be
true
but
they
frequently
ask
why
should
i
do
what
i
see
to
be
right
it
is
easy
to
reply
that
the
question
is
futile
since
it
could
only
be
answered
by
a
reference
to
some
other
recognised
principle
of
right
conduct
and
the
question
might
just
as
well
be
asked
as
regards
that
again
and
so
on
but
still
we
do
ask
the
question
widely
and
continually
and
therefore
this
demonstration
of
its
futility
is
not
completely
satisfactory
we
require
besides
some
explanation
of
its
persistency
one
explanation
that
may
be
offered
is
that
since
we
are
moved
to
action
not
by
moral
judgment
alone
but
also
by
desires
and
inclinations
that
operate
independently
of
moral
judgment
the
answer
which
we
really
want
to
the
question
why
should
i
do
it
is
one
which
does
not
merely
prove
a
certain
action
to
be
right
but
also
stirs
in
us
a
predominant
inclination
to
do
the
action
that
this
explanation
is
true
for
some
minds
in
some
moods
i
would
not
deny
still
i
think
that
when
a
man
seriously
asks
why
he
should
do
anything
he
commonly
assumes
in
himself
a
determination
to
pursue
whatever
conduct
may
be
shown
by
argument
to
be
reasonable
even
though
it
be
very
different
from
that
to
which
his
inclinations
may
prompt
and
we
are
generally
agreed
that
reasonable
conduct
in
any
case
has
to
be
determined
on
principles
in
applying
which
the
agent
s
inclination
as
it
exists
apart
from
such
determination
is
only
one
element
among
several
that
have
to
be
considered
and
commonly
not
the
most
important
element
but
when
we
ask
what
these
principles
are
the
diversity
of
answers
which
we
find
manifestly
declared
in
the
systems
and
fundamental
formulæ
of
professed
moralists
seems
to
be
really
present
in
the
common
practical
reasoning
of
men
generally
with
this
difference
that
whereas
the
philosopher
seeks
unity
of
principle
and
consistency
of
method
at
the
risk
of
paradox
the
unphilosophic
man
is
apt
to
hold
different
principles
at
once
and
to
apply
different
methods
in
more
or
less
confused
combination
if
this
be
so
we
can
offer
another
explanation
of
the
persistent
unsatisfied
demand
for
an
ultimate
reason
above
noticed
for
if
there
are
different
views
of
the
ultimate
reasonableness
of
conduct
implicit
in
the
thought
of
ordinary
men
though
not
brought
into
clear
relation
to
each
other
it
is
easy
to
see
that
any
single
answer
to
the
question
why
will
not
be
completely
satisfactory
as
it
will
be
given
only
from
one
of
these
points
of
view
and
will
always
leave
room
to
ask
the
question
from
some
other
i
am
myself
convinced
that
this
is
the
main
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
and
it
is
on
this
conviction
that
the
plan
of
the
present
treatise
is
based
we
can
not
of
course
regard
as
valid
reasonings
that
lead
to
conflicting
conclusions
and
i
therefore
assume
as
a
fundamental
postulate
of
ethics
that
so
far
as
two
methods
conflict
one
or
other
of
them
must
be
modified
or
rejected
but
i
think
it
fundamentally
important
to
recognise
at
the
outset
of
ethical
inquiry
that
there
is
a
diversity
of
methods
applied
in
ordinary
practical
thought
what
then
are
these
different
methods
what
are
the
different
practical
principles
which
the
common
sense
of
mankind
is
prepared
to
accept
as
ultimate
some
care
is
needed
in
answering
this
question
because
we
frequently
prescribe
that
this
or
that
ought
to
be
done
or
aimed
at
without
any
express
reference
to
an
ulterior
end
while
yet
such
an
end
is
tacitly
presupposed
it
is
obvious
that
such
prescriptions
are
merely
what
kant
calls
them
hypothetical
imperatives
they
are
not
addressed
to
any
one
who
has
not
first
accepted
the
end
for
instance
a
teacher
of
any
art
assumes
that
his
pupil
wants
to
produce
the
product
of
the
art
or
to
produce
it
excellent
in
quality
he
tells
him
that
he
to
hold
the
awl
the
hammer
the
brush
differently
a
physician
assumes
that
his
patient
wants
health
he
tells
him
that
he
to
rise
early
to
live
plainly
to
take
hard
exercise
if
the
patient
deliberately
prefers
ease
and
good
living
to
health
the
physician
s
precepts
fall
to
the
ground
they
are
no
longer
addressed
to
him
so
again
a
man
of
the
world
assumes
that
his
hearers
wish
to
get
on
in
society
when
he
lays
down
rules
of
dress
manner
conversation
habits
of
life
a
similar
view
may
be
plausibly
taken
of
many
rules
prescribing
what
are
sometimes
called
duties
to
oneself
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
given
on
the
assumption
that
a
man
regards
his
own
happiness
as
an
ultimate
end
that
if
any
one
should
be
so
exceptional
as
to
disregard
it
he
does
not
come
within
their
scope
in
short
that
the
in
such
formulæ
is
still
implicitly
relative
to
an
end
it
does
not
however
seem
to
me
that
this
account
of
the
matter
is
exhaustive
we
do
not
all
look
with
simple
indifference
on
a
man
who
declines
to
take
the
right
means
to
attain
his
own
happiness
on
no
other
ground
than
that
he
does
not
care
about
happiness
most
men
would
regard
such
a
refusal
as
irrational
with
a
certain
disapprobation
they
would
thus
implicitly
assent
to
butler
s
statement
that
interest
one
s
own
happiness
is
a
manifest
in
other
words
they
would
think
that
a
man
to
care
for
his
own
happiness
the
word
ought
thus
used
is
no
longer
relative
happiness
now
appears
as
an
ultimate
end
the
pursuit
of
which
at
least
within
the
limits
imposed
by
other
duties
appears
to
be
prescribed
by
reason
categorically
as
kant
would
say
without
any
tacit
assumption
of
a
still
ulterior
end
and
it
has
been
widely
held
by
even
orthodox
moralists
that
all
morality
rests
ultimately
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
that
its
rules
are
ultimately
binding
on
any
individual
only
so
far
as
it
is
his
interest
on
the
whole
to
observe
them
still
common
moral
opinion
certainly
regards
the
duty
or
virtue
of
prudence
as
only
a
part
and
not
the
most
important
part
of
duty
or
virtue
in
general
common
moral
opinion
recognises
and
inculcates
other
fundamental
rules
those
of
justice
good
faith
veracity
which
in
its
ordinary
judgments
on
particular
cases
it
is
inclined
to
treat
as
binding
without
qualification
and
without
regard
to
ulterior
consequences
and
in
the
ordinary
form
of
the
intuitional
view
of
ethics
the
categorical
prescription
of
such
rules
is
maintained
explicitly
and
definitely
as
a
result
of
philosophical
reflection
and
the
realisation
of
virtue
in
act
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
virtues
just
mentioned
is
held
to
consist
in
strict
and
unswerving
conformity
to
such
rules
on
the
other
hand
it
is
contended
by
many
utilitarians
that
all
the
rules
of
conduct
which
men
prescribe
to
one
another
as
moral
rules
are
really
though
in
part
unconsciously
prescribed
as
means
to
the
general
happiness
of
mankind
or
of
the
whole
aggregate
of
sentient
beings
and
it
is
still
more
widely
held
by
utilitarian
thinkers
that
such
rules
however
they
may
originate
are
only
valid
so
far
as
their
observance
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
this
contention
i
shall
hereafter
examine
with
due
care
here
i
wish
only
to
point
out
that
if
the
duty
of
aiming
at
the
general
happiness
is
thus
taken
to
include
all
other
duties
as
subordinate
applications
of
it
we
seem
to
be
again
led
to
the
notion
of
happiness
as
an
ultimate
end
categorically
prescribed
only
it
is
now
general
happiness
and
not
the
private
happiness
of
any
individual
and
this
is
the
view
that
i
myself
take
of
the
utilitarian
principle
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
necessary
in
the
methodical
investigation
of
right
conduct
considered
relatively
to
the
end
either
of
private
or
of
general
happiness
to
assume
that
the
end
itself
is
determined
or
prescribed
by
reason
we
only
require
to
assume
in
reasoning
to
cogent
practical
conclusions
that
it
is
adopted
as
ultimate
and
paramount
for
if
a
man
accepts
any
end
as
ultimate
and
paramount
he
accepts
implicitly
as
his
method
of
ethics
whatever
process
of
reasoning
enables
him
to
determine
the
actions
most
conducive
to
this
end
since
however
to
every
difference
in
the
end
accepted
at
least
some
difference
in
method
will
generally
correspond
if
all
the
ends
which
men
are
found
practically
to
adopt
as
ultimate
subordinating
everything
else
to
the
attainment
of
them
under
the
influence
of
ruling
passions
were
taken
as
principles
for
which
the
student
of
ethics
is
called
upon
to
construct
rational
methods
his
task
would
be
very
complex
and
extensive
but
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
such
ends
as
the
common
sense
of
mankind
appears
to
accept
as
rational
ultimate
ends
the
task
is
reduced
i
think
within
manageable
limits
since
this
criterion
will
exclude
at
least
many
of
the
objects
which
men
practically
seem
to
regard
as
paramount
thus
many
men
sacrifice
health
fortune
happiness
to
fame
but
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
has
deliberately
maintained
that
fame
is
an
object
which
it
is
reasonable
for
men
to
seek
for
its
own
sake
it
only
commends
itself
to
reflective
minds
either
as
a
source
of
happiness
to
the
person
who
gains
it
or
a
sign
of
his
excellence
moral
or
intellectual
or
because
it
attests
the
achievement
by
him
of
some
important
benefit
to
society
and
at
the
same
time
stimulates
him
and
others
to
further
achievement
in
the
future
and
the
conception
of
benefit
would
when
examined
in
its
turn
lead
us
again
to
happiness
or
excellence
of
human
nature
since
a
man
is
commonly
thought
to
benefit
others
either
by
making
them
happier
or
by
making
them
wiser
and
more
virtuous
whether
there
are
any
ends
besides
these
two
which
can
be
reasonably
regarded
as
ultimate
it
will
hereafter
be
part
of
our
business
to
investigate
but
we
may
perhaps
say
that
the
only
two
ends
which
have
a
strongly
and
widely
supported
claim
to
be
regarded
as
rational
ultimate
ends
are
the
two
just
mentioned
happiness
and
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
nature
meaning
here
by
excellence
not
primarily
superiority
to
others
but
a
partial
realisation
of
or
approximation
to
an
ideal
type
of
human
perfection
and
we
must
observe
that
the
adoption
of
the
former
of
these
ends
leads
us
to
two
distinct
methods
according
as
it
is
sought
to
be
realised
universally
or
by
each
individual
for
himself
alone
for
though
doubtless
a
man
may
often
best
promote
his
own
happiness
by
labouring
and
abstaining
for
the
sake
of
others
it
seems
to
be
implied
in
our
common
notion
of
that
actions
most
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
do
not
in
this
world
at
least
always
tend
also
to
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
agent
and
among
those
who
hold
that
happiness
is
our
being
s
end
and
aim
we
seem
to
find
a
fundamental
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whose
happiness
it
is
that
it
is
ultimately
reasonable
to
aim
at
for
to
some
it
seems
that
the
constantly
proper
end
of
action
on
the
part
of
any
individual
at
the
moment
of
action
is
his
real
greatest
happiness
from
that
moment
to
the
end
of
his
life
whereas
others
hold
that
the
view
of
reason
is
essentially
universal
and
that
it
can
not
be
reasonable
to
take
as
an
ultimate
and
paramount
end
the
happiness
of
any
one
individual
rather
than
that
of
any
other
at
any
rate
if
equally
deserving
and
susceptible
of
it
so
that
general
happiness
must
be
the
true
standard
of
right
and
wrong
in
the
field
of
morals
no
less
than
of
politics
it
is
of
course
possible
to
adopt
an
end
intermediate
between
the
two
and
to
aim
at
the
happiness
of
some
limited
portion
of
mankind
such
as
one
s
family
or
nation
or
race
but
any
such
limitation
seems
arbitrary
and
probably
few
would
maintain
it
to
be
reasonable
except
as
the
most
practicable
way
of
aiming
at
the
general
happiness
or
of
indirectly
securing
one
s
own
the
case
seems
to
be
otherwise
with
excellence
or
perfection
at
first
sight
indeed
the
same
alternatives
present
themselves
it
seems
that
the
excellence
aimed
at
may
be
taken
either
individually
or
universally
and
circumstances
are
conceivable
in
which
a
man
is
not
unlikely
to
think
that
he
could
best
promote
the
excellence
of
others
by
sacrificing
his
own
but
no
moralist
who
takes
excellence
as
an
ultimate
end
has
ever
approved
of
such
sacrifice
at
least
so
far
as
moral
excellence
is
concerned
no
one
has
ever
directed
an
individual
to
promote
the
virtue
of
others
except
in
so
far
as
this
promotion
is
compatible
with
or
rather
involved
in
the
complete
realisation
of
virtue
in
himself
so
far
then
there
seems
to
be
no
need
of
separating
the
method
of
determining
right
conduct
which
takes
the
excellence
or
perfection
of
the
individual
as
the
ultimate
aim
from
that
which
aims
at
the
excellence
or
perfection
of
the
human
community
and
since
virtue
is
commonly
conceived
as
the
most
valuable
element
of
human
excellence
and
an
element
essentially
preferable
to
any
other
element
that
can
come
into
competition
with
it
as
an
alternative
for
rational
choice
any
method
which
takes
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
nature
as
ultimate
end
will
coincide
to
a
great
extent
with
that
based
on
what
i
called
the
intuitional
view
and
i
have
accordingly
decided
to
treat
it
as
a
special
form
of
this
latter
the
two
methods
which
take
happiness
as
an
ultimate
end
it
will
be
convenient
to
distinguish
as
egoistic
and
universalistic
hedonism
and
as
it
is
the
latter
of
these
as
taught
by
bentham
and
his
successors
that
is
more
generally
understood
under
the
term
utilitarianism
i
shall
always
restrict
that
word
to
this
signification
for
egoistic
hedonism
it
is
somewhat
hard
to
find
a
single
perfectly
appropriate
term
i
shall
often
call
this
simply
egoism
but
it
may
sometimes
be
convenient
to
call
it
epicureanism
for
though
this
name
more
properly
denotes
a
particular
historical
system
it
has
come
to
be
commonly
used
in
the
wider
sense
in
which
i
wish
to
employ
it
the
last
sentence
suggests
one
more
explanation
which
for
clearness
sake
it
seems
desirable
to
make
an
explanation
however
rather
of
the
plan
and
purpose
of
the
present
treatise
than
of
the
nature
and
boundaries
of
the
subject
of
ethics
as
generally
understood
there
are
several
recognised
ways
of
treating
this
subject
none
of
which
i
have
thought
it
desirable
to
adopt
we
may
start
with
existing
systems
and
either
study
them
historically
tracing
the
changes
in
thought
through
the
centuries
or
compare
and
classify
them
according
to
relations
of
resemblance
or
criticise
their
internal
coherence
or
we
may
seek
to
add
to
the
number
of
these
systems
and
claim
after
so
many
unsuccessful
efforts
to
have
at
last
attained
the
one
true
theory
of
the
subject
by
which
all
others
may
be
tested
the
present
book
contains
neither
the
exposition
of
a
system
nor
a
natural
or
critical
history
of
systems
i
have
attempted
to
define
and
unfold
not
one
method
of
ethics
but
several
at
the
same
time
these
are
not
here
studied
historically
as
methods
that
have
actually
been
used
or
proposed
for
the
regulation
of
practice
but
rather
as
alternatives
between
which
so
far
as
they
can
not
be
reconciled
the
human
mind
seems
to
me
necessarily
forced
to
choose
when
it
attempts
to
frame
a
complete
synthesis
of
practical
maxims
and
to
act
in
a
perfectly
consistent
manner
thus
they
might
perhaps
be
called
natural
methods
rationalised
because
men
commonly
seem
to
guide
themselves
by
a
mixture
of
different
methods
more
or
less
disguised
under
ambiguities
of
language
the
impulses
or
principles
from
which
the
different
methods
take
their
rise
the
different
claims
of
different
ends
to
be
rational
are
admitted
to
some
extent
by
all
minds
and
as
along
with
these
claims
is
felt
the
need
of
harmonising
them
since
it
is
as
was
said
a
postulate
of
the
practical
reason
that
two
conflicting
rules
of
action
can
not
both
be
reasonable
the
result
is
ordinarily
either
a
confused
blending
or
a
forced
and
premature
reconciliation
of
different
principles
and
methods
nor
have
the
systems
framed
by
professed
moralists
been
free
from
similar
defects
the
writers
have
usually
proceeded
to
synthesis
without
adequate
analysis
the
practical
demand
for
the
former
being
more
urgently
felt
than
the
theoretical
need
of
the
latter
for
here
as
in
other
points
the
development
of
the
theory
of
ethics
would
seem
to
be
somewhat
impeded
by
the
preponderance
of
practical
considerations
and
perhaps
a
more
complete
detachment
of
the
theoretical
study
of
right
conduct
from
its
practical
application
is
to
be
desired
for
the
sake
even
of
the
latter
itself
since
a
treatment
which
is
a
compound
between
the
scientific
and
the
hortatory
is
apt
to
miss
both
the
results
that
it
would
combine
the
mixture
is
bewildering
to
the
brain
and
not
stimulating
to
the
heart
so
again
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
here
as
in
other
sciences
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
draw
as
distinct
a
line
as
possible
between
the
known
and
the
unknown
as
the
clear
indication
of
an
unsolved
problem
is
at
any
rate
a
step
to
its
solution
in
ethical
treatises
however
there
has
been
a
continual
tendency
to
ignore
and
keep
out
of
sight
the
difficulties
of
the
subject
either
unconsciously
from
a
latent
conviction
that
the
questions
which
the
writer
can
not
answer
satisfactorily
must
be
questions
which
ought
not
to
be
asked
or
consciously
that
he
may
not
shake
the
sway
of
morality
over
the
minds
of
his
readers
this
last
precaution
frequently
defeats
itself
the
difficulties
thus
concealed
in
exposition
are
liable
to
reappear
in
controversy
and
then
they
appear
not
carefully
limited
but
magnified
for
polemical
purposes
thus
we
get
on
the
one
hand
vague
and
hazy
reconciliation
on
the
other
loose
and
random
exaggeration
of
discrepancies
and
neither
process
is
effective
to
dispel
the
original
vagueness
and
ambiguity
which
lurks
in
the
fundamental
notions
of
our
common
practical
reasonings
to
eliminate
or
reduce
this
indefiniteness
and
confusion
is
the
sole
immediate
end
that
i
have
proposed
to
myself
in
the
present
work
in
order
better
to
execute
this
task
i
have
refrained
from
expressly
attempting
any
such
complete
and
final
solution
of
the
chief
ethical
difficulties
and
controversies
as
would
convert
this
exposition
of
various
methods
into
the
development
of
a
harmonious
system
at
the
same
time
i
hope
to
afford
aid
towards
the
construction
of
such
a
system
because
it
seems
easier
to
judge
of
the
mutual
relations
and
conflicting
claims
of
different
modes
of
thought
after
an
impartial
and
rigorous
investigation
of
the
conclusions
to
which
they
logically
lead
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
in
reflecting
on
practical
principles
that
however
unhesitatingly
they
seem
to
command
our
assent
at
first
sight
and
however
familiar
and
apparently
clear
the
notions
of
which
they
are
composed
nevertheless
when
we
have
carefully
examined
the
consequences
of
adopting
them
they
wear
a
changed
and
somewhat
dubious
aspect
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
most
of
the
practical
principles
that
have
been
seriously
put
forward
are
more
or
less
satisfactory
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
so
long
as
they
have
the
field
to
themselves
they
all
find
a
response
in
our
nature
their
fundamental
assumptions
are
all
such
as
we
are
disposed
to
accept
and
such
as
we
find
to
govern
to
a
certain
extent
our
habitual
conduct
when
i
am
asked
do
you
not
consider
it
ultimately
reasonable
to
seek
pleasure
and
avoid
pain
for
yourself
have
you
not
a
moral
sense
do
you
not
intuitively
pronounce
some
actions
to
be
right
and
others
wrong
do
you
not
acknowledge
the
general
happiness
to
be
a
paramount
end
i
answer
yes
to
all
these
questions
my
difficulty
begins
when
i
have
to
choose
between
the
different
principles
or
inferences
drawn
from
them
we
admit
the
necessity
when
they
conflict
of
making
this
choice
and
that
it
is
irrational
to
let
sometimes
one
principle
prevail
and
sometimes
another
but
the
necessity
is
a
painful
one
we
can
not
but
hope
that
all
methods
may
ultimately
coincide
and
at
any
rate
before
making
our
election
we
may
reasonably
wish
to
have
the
completest
possible
knowledge
of
each
my
object
then
in
the
present
work
is
to
expound
as
clearly
and
as
fully
as
my
limits
will
allow
the
different
methods
of
ethics
that
i
find
implicit
in
our
common
moral
reasoning
to
point
out
their
mutual
relations
and
where
they
seem
to
conflict
to
define
the
issue
as
much
as
possible
in
the
course
of
this
endeavour
i
am
led
to
discuss
the
considerations
which
should
in
my
opinion
be
decisive
in
determining
the
adoption
of
ethical
first
principles
but
it
is
not
my
primary
aim
to
establish
such
principles
nor
again
is
it
my
primary
aim
to
supply
a
set
of
practical
directions
for
conduct
i
have
wished
to
keep
the
reader
s
attention
throughout
directed
to
the
processes
rather
than
the
results
of
ethical
thought
and
have
therefore
never
stated
as
my
own
any
positive
practical
conclusions
unless
by
way
of
illustration
and
have
never
ventured
to
decide
dogmatically
any
controverted
points
except
where
the
controversy
seemed
to
arise
from
want
of
precision
or
clearness
in
the
definition
of
principles
or
want
of
consistency
in
reasoning
footnotes
the
exact
relation
of
the
terms
right
and
what
ought
to
be
is
discussed
in
chap
iii
of
this
book
i
here
assume
that
they
may
be
used
as
convertible
for
most
purposes
i
use
politics
in
what
i
take
to
be
its
most
ordinary
signification
to
denote
the
science
or
study
of
right
or
good
legislation
and
government
there
is
a
wider
possible
sense
of
the
term
according
to
which
it
would
include
the
greater
part
of
ethics
if
understood
to
be
the
theory
of
right
social
relations

ii
the
relation
of
the
notion
of
good
to
that
of
right

chap
vi
the
utilitarians
since
bentham
have
sometimes
adopted
one
sometimes
the
other
of
these
two
principles
as
paramount
i
use
the
terms
excellence
and
perfection
to
denote
the
same
ultimate
end
regarded
in
somewhat
different
aspects
meaning
by
either
an
ideal
complex
of
mental
qualities
of
which
we
admire
and
approve
the
manifestation
in
human
life
but
using
perfection
to
denote
the
ideal
as
such
while
excellence
denotes
such
partial
realisation
of
or
approximation
to
the
ideal
as
we
actually
find
in
human
experience
it
may
be
said
that
even
more
divergent
views
of
the
reasonable
end
are
possible
here
than
in
the
case
of
happiness
for
we
are
not
necessarily
limited
as
in
that
case
to
the
consideration
of
sentient
beings
inanimate
things
also
seem
to
have
a
perfection
and
excellence
of
their
own
and
to
be
capable
of
being
made
better
or
worse
in
their
kind
and
this
perfection
or
one
species
of
it
appears
to
be
the
end
of
the
fine
arts
but
reflection
i
think
shows
that
neither
beauty
nor
any
other
quality
of
inanimate
objects
can
be
regarded
as
good
or
desirable
in
itself
out
of
relation
to
the
perfection
or
happiness
of
sentient
beings

ix
of
this
book
kant
roundly
denies
that
it
can
be
my
duty
to
take
the
perfection
of
others
for
my
end
but
his

the
relation
of
ethics
to
politics
in
the
last
chapter
i
have
spoken
of
ethics
and
politics
as
being
both
practical
studies
including
in
the
scope
of
their
investigation
somewhat
that
lies
outside
the
sphere
of
positive
sciences
viz
the
determination
of
ends
to
be
sought
or
rules
to
be
unconditionally
obeyed
before
proceeding
further
it
would
seem
desirable
to
determine
in
outline
the
mutual
relations
of
these
cognate
studies
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
of
ethics
as
i
have
defined
them
ethics
aims
at
determining
what
ought
to
be
done
by
individuals
while
politics
aims
at
determining
what
the
government
of
a
state
or
political
society
ought
to
do
and
how
it
ought
to
be
constituted
including
under
the
latter
head
all
questions
as
to
the
control
over
government
that
should
be
exercised
by
the
governed
at
first
sight
it
may
seem
that
politics
so
conceived
must
be
a
branch
of
ethics
for
all
the
actions
of
government
are
actions
of
individuals
alone
or
in
combination
and
so
are
all
the
actions
of
those
who
obeying
influencing
or
perhaps
occasionally
resisting
government
maintain
and
from
time
to
time
modify
the
constitution
of
their
state
and
it
would
seem
that
if
properly
performed
such
actions
must
be
determined
on
ethical
principles
or
be
capable
of
justification
by
such
principles
but
this
argument
is
not
decisive
for
by
similar
reasoning
ethics
would
have
to
comprehend
all
arts
liberal
and
industrial
it
is
a
main
part
of
the
moral
duty
of
a
and
his
subordinates
to
navigate
their
ship
properly
but
we
do
not
take
ethics
to
include
a
study
of
the
rules
of
navigation
it
may
be
replied
that
every
man
is
not
a
sailor
but
at
least
in
a
country
under
popular
government
every
citizen
has
important
political
duties
which
he
ought
to
perform
according
to
knowledge
so
far
as
possible
but
similarly
it
is
an
important
part
of
every
adult
s
moral
duty
to
take
care
of
his
health
and
it
is
proverbial
that
every
man
at
forty
is
a
fool
or
his
own
physician
yet
we
do
not
consider
ethics
to
include
the
art
of
medicine
the
specially
important
connexion
between
ethics
and
politics
arises
in
a
different
way
it
is
the
business
of
government
by
laying
down
and
enforcing
laws
to
regulate
the
outward
conduct
of
the
governed
not
in
one
department
only
but
in
all
their
social
relations
so
far
as
such
conduct
is
a
proper
subject
for
coercive
rules
and
not
only
ought
this
regulation
to
be
in
harmony
with
morality
for
obviously
people
ought
not
to
be
compelled
to
do
what
they
ought
not
to
do
but
further
to
an
important
extent
the
law
of
a
man
s
state
will
properly
determine
the
details
of
his
moral
duty
even
beyond
the
sphere
of
legal
enforcement
thus
we
commonly
regard
it
as
an
individual
s
moral
duty
under
the
head
of
justice
to
give
every
man
his
own
even
when
through
some
accident
the
other
party
has
not
the
power
of
legally
enforcing
his
right
but
still
in
considering
what
is
the
other
s
own
we
assume
him
generally
to
be
guided
by
the
law
of
his
state
if
that
were
changed
his
moral
duty
would
change
with
it
similarly
the
mutual
moral
duties
of
husbands
and
wives
and
of
children
and
parents
will
vary
in
detail
with
the
variations
in
their
legal
relations
but
when
we
look
closer
at
the
relation
thus
constituted
between
ethics
and
politics
we
see
that
a
distinction
has
to
be
taken
between
actual
or
positive
law
and
ideal
law
or
law
as
it
ought
to
be
it
is
for
the
latter
that
political
theory
lays
down
principles
but
it
is
positive
not
ideal
law
that
primarily
determines
right
conduct
for
an
individual
here
and
now
in
the
manner
just
exemplified
no
doubt
if
positive
and
ideal
law
appear
to
me
to
diverge
very
widely
if
i
am
convinced
by
political
theory
that
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law
of
property
is
desirable
this
conviction
is
likely
to
influence
my
view
of
my
moral
duty
under
the
existing
law
but
the
extent
of
this
influence
is
vague
and
uncertain
suppose
i
am
a
in
a
society
in
which
slavery
is
established
and
become
convinced
that
private
property
in
human
beings
should
be
abolished
by
law
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
i
shall
regard
it
as
my
moral
duty
to
set
free
my
slaves
at
once
i
may
think
immediate
general
abolition
of
slavery
not
only
hopeless
but
even
inexpedient
for
the
slaves
themselves
who
require
a
gradual
education
for
freedom
so
that
it
is
better
for
the
present
to
aim
at
legal
changes
that
would
cut
off
the
worst
evils
of
slavery
and
meanwhile
to
set
an
example
of
humane
and
considerate
treatment
of
bondsmen
similar
reasonings
might
be
applied
to
the
abolition
of
private
property
in
the
instruments
of
production
or
in
appointments
to
offices
civil
or
ecclesiastical
speaking
generally
the
extent
to
which
political
ideals
ought
to
influence
moral
duty
would
seem
to
depend
partly
on
the
apparent
remoteness
or
nearness
of
the
prospect
of
realising
the
ideal
partly
on
its
imperativeness
or
the
expediency
of
immediate
realisation
and
the
force
attached
to
both
these
considerations
is
likely
to
vary
with
the
political
method
adopted
so
that
it
belongs
to
politics
rather
than
ethics
to
determine
them
more
precisely
to
sum
up
we
have
to
distinguish
clearly
between
two
questions
how
far
the
determination
of
right
conduct
for
an
individual
here
and
now
ought
to
be
influenced
by
positive
laws
and
other
commands
of
government
as
actually
established
and
how
far
it
ought
to
be
influenced
by
political
theory
as
to
the
functions
and
structure
of
government
as
it
ought
to
be
as
regards
the
former
it
clearly
belongs
to
ethics
to
determine
the
grounds
and
limits
of
obedience
to
government
and
also
the
general
conception
of
political
duty
so
far
as
it
goes
beyond
mere
obedience
with
due
recognition
of
the
large
variations
due
to
the
varying
political
conditions
of
different
states
a
good
citizen
in
the
united
states
will
reasonably
form
a
conception
of
his
actual
political
duty
widely
divergent
from
that
reasonably
formed
by
a
good
citizen
in
russia
and
this
will
be
the
primary
business
of
ethics
so
far
as
it
deals
with
the
political
side
of
life
the
discussion
of
political
ideals
will
only
come
within
its
purview
in
a
more
indefinite
and
indirect
way
so
far
as
such
ideals
can
not
but
have
some
influence
on
the
determination
of
political
duty
under
existing
conditions
i
have
stated
the
relation
of
ethics
to
politics
regarded
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
that
seems
to
me
to
accord
with
the
definition
of
the
former
subject
adopted
in
the
preceding
chapter
some
thinkers
however
take
a
view
of
ethical
theory
which
involves
a
relation
to
political
theory
quite
different
from
that
just
set
forth
regarding
theoretical
or
absolute
ethics
as
properly
an
investigation
not
of
what
ought
to
be
done
here
and
now
but
of
what
ought
to
be
the
rules
of
behaviour
in
a
society
of
ideally
perfect
human
beings
thus
the
of
our
study
would
be
doubly
ideal
as
it
would
not
only
prescribe
what
ought
to
be
done
as
distinct
from
what
is
but
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
society
that
itself
not
but
only
to
be
in
this
view
the
conclusions
of
theoretical
or
absolute
ethics
would
have
as
indirect
and
uncertain
a
relation
to
the
practical
problems
of
actual
life
as
those
of
theoretical
politics
or
even
more
so
as
in
sober
political
theory
it
is
commonly
only
the
government
and
not
the
governed
society
that
is
conceived
in
an
ideal
condition
still
the
two
studies
are
not
unlikely
to
blend
in
one
theory
of
ideal
social
relations
unless
the
ideal
society
is
conceived
as
having
no
need
of
government
so
that
politics
in
the
ordinary
sense
vanishes
altogether
those
who
take
this
view
adduce
the
analogy
of
geometry
to
show
that
ethics
ought
to
deal
with
ideally
perfect
human
relations
just
as
geometry
treats
of
ideally
straight
lines
and
perfect
circles
but
the
irregular
lines
which
we
meet
with
in
experience
have
spatial
relations
which
geometry
does
not
ignore
altogether
it
can
and
does
ascertain
them
with
a
sufficient
degree
of
accuracy
for
practical
purposes
though
of
course
they
are
more
complex
than
those
of
perfectly
straight
lines
so
in
astronomy
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
purposes
of
study
if
the
stars
moved
in
circles
as
was
once
believed
but
the
fact
that
they
move
not
in
circles
but
in
ellipses
and
even
in
imperfect
and
perturbed
ellipses
does
not
take
them
out
of
the
sphere
of
scientific
investigation
by
patience
and
industry
we
have
learnt
how
to
reduce
to
principles
and
calculate
even
these
more
complicated
motions
it
may
be
useful
for
purposes
of
instruction
to
assume
that
the
planets
move
in
perfect
ellipses
but
what
we
want
as
astronomers
to
know
is
the
actual
motion
of
the
stars
and
its
causes
and
similarly
as
moralists
we
naturally
inquire
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
actual
world
in
which
we
live
in
neither
case
can
we
hope
to
represent
in
our
general
reasonings
the
full
complexity
of
the
actual
considerations
but
we
endeavour
to
approximate
to
it
as
closely
as
possible
it
is
only
so
that
we
really
grapple
with
the
question
to
which
mankind
generally
require
an
answer
what
is
a
man
s
duty
in
his
present
condition
for
it
is
too
paradoxical
to
say
that
the
whole
duty
of
man
is
summed
up
in
the
effort
to
attain
an
ideal
state
of
social
relations
and
unless
we
say
this
we
must
determine
our
duties
to
existing
men
in
view
of
existing
circumstances
and
this
is
what
the
student
of
ethics
seeks
to
do
in
a
systematic
manner
the
inquiry
into
the
morality
of
an
ideal
society
can
therefore
be
at
best
but
a
preliminary
investigation
after
which
the
step
from
the
ideal
to
the
actual
in
accordance
with
reason
remains
to
be
taken
we
have
to
ask
then
how
far
such
a
preliminary
construction
seems
desirable
and
in
answering
this
we
must
distinguish
the
different
methods
of
ethics
for
it
is
generally
held
by
intuitionists
that
true
morality
prescribes
absolutely
what
is
in
itself
right
under
all
social
conditions
at
least
as
far
as
determinate
duties
are
concerned
as
that
truth
should
always
be
spoken
and
promises
kept
and
justice
be
done
though
the
sky
should
and
so
far
as
this
is
held
it
would
seem
that
there
can
be
no
fundamental
distinction
drawn
in
the
determination
of
duty
between
the
actual
state
of
society
and
an
ideal
state
at
any
rate
the
general
definition
of
justice
will
be
the
same
for
both
no
less
than
its
absolute
stringency
still
even
an
extreme
intuitionist
would
admit
that
the
details
of
justice
and
other
duties
will
vary
with
social
institutions
and
it
is
a
plausible
suggestion
that
if
we
can
clearly
contemplate
as
a
pattern
the
absolute
justice
of
an
ideal
community
we
shall
be
better
able
to
attain
the
merely
relative
justice
that
is
alone
possible
under
existing
conditions
how
far
this
is
so
we
shall
be
in
a
better
position
to
judge
when
we
have
examined
the
definition
of
justice
from
an
intuitional
point
of
view
the
question
takes
a
simpler
form
in
the
case
of
the
method
which
proposes
as
an
ultimate
end
and
supreme
standard
universal
happiness
here
we
have
merely
to
ask
how
far
a
systematic
consideration
of
the
social
relations
of
an
ideally
happy
group
of
human
beings
is
likely
to
afford
guidance
in
our
efforts
to
promote
human
happiness
here
and
now
i
shall
not
at
present
deny
that
this
task
might
usefully
be
included
in
an
exhaustive
study
of
this
method
but
it
can
easily
be
shown
that
it
is
involved
in
serious
difficulties
for
as
in
ordinary
deliberation
we
have
to
consider
what
is
best
under
certain
conditions
of
human
life
internal
or
external
so
we
must
do
this
in
contemplating
the
ideal
society
we
require
to
contemplate
not
so
much
the
end
supposed
to
be
attained
which
is
simply
the
most
pleasant
consciousness
conceivable
lasting
as
long
and
as
uninterruptedly
as
possible
but
rather
some
method
of
realising
it
pursued
by
human
beings
and
these
again
must
be
conceived
as
existing
under
conditions
not
too
remote
from
our
own
so
that
we
can
at
least
endeavour
to
imitate
them
and
for
this
we
must
know
how
far
our
present
circumstances
are
modifiable
a
very
difficult
question
as
the
constructions
which
have
actually
been
made
of
such
ideal
societies
show
for
example
the
of
plato
seems
in
many
respects
sufficiently
divergent
from
the
reality
and
yet
he
contemplates
war
as
a
permanent
unalterable
fact
to
be
provided
for
in
the
ideal
state
and
indeed
such
provision
seems
the
predominant
aim
of
his
construction
whereas
the
soberest
modern
utopia
would
certainly
include
the
suppression
of
war
indeed
the
ideal
will
often
seem
to
diverge
in
diametrically
opposite
directions
from
the
actual
according
to
the
line
of
imagined
change
which
we
happen
to
adopt
in
our
visionary
flight
from
present
evils
for
example
permanent
now
cause
some
unhappiness
because
conjugal
affection
is
not
always
permanent
but
they
are
thought
to
be
necessary
partly
to
protect
men
and
women
from
vagaries
of
passion
pernicious
to
themselves
but
chiefly
in
order
to
the
better
rearing
of
children
now
it
may
seem
to
some
that
in
an
ideal
state
of
society
we
could
trust
more
to
parental
affections
and
require
less
to
control
the
natural
play
of
emotion
between
the
sexes
and
that
free
love
is
therefore
the
ideal
while
others
would
maintain
that
permanence
in
conjugal
affection
is
natural
and
normal
and
that
any
exceptions
to
this
rule
must
be
supposed
to
disappear
as
we
approximate
to
the
ideal
again
the
happiness
enjoyed
in
our
actual
society
seems
much
diminished
by
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
means
of
happiness
and
the
division
of
mankind
into
rich
and
poor
but
we
can
conceive
this
evil
removed
in
two
quite
different
ways
either
by
an
increased
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
rich
to
redistribute
their
share
or
by
such
social
arrangements
as
would
enable
the
poor
to
secure
more
for
themselves
in
the
one
case
the
ideal
involves
a
great
extension
and
systematisation
of
the
arbitrary
and
casual
almsgiving
that
now
goes
on
in
the
other
case
its
extinction
in
short
it
seems
that
when
we
abandon
the
firm
ground
of
actual
society
we
have
an
illimitable
cloudland
surrounding
us
on
all
sides
in
which
we
may
construct
any
variety
of
pattern
states
but
no
definite
ideal
to
which
the
actual
undeniably
approximates
as
the
straight
lines
and
circles
of
the
actual
physical
world
approximate
to
those
of
scientific
geometry
it
may
be
said
however
that
we
can
reduce
this
variety
by
studying
the
past
history
of
mankind
as
this
will
enable
us
to
predict
to
some
extent
their
future
manner
of
existence
but
even
so
it
does
not
appear
that
we
shall
gain
much
definite
guidance
for
our
present
conduct
for
let
us
make
the
most
favourable
suppositions
that
we
can
and
such
as
soar
even
above
the
confidence
of
the
most
dogmatic
of
scientific
historians
let
us
assume
that
the
process
of
human
history
is
a
progress
of
mankind
towards
ever
greater
happiness
let
us
assume
further
that
we
can
not
only
fix
certain
limits
within
which
the
future
social
condition
of
mankind
must
lie
but
even
determine
in
detail
the
mutual
relations
of
the
different
elements
of
the
future
community
so
as
to
view
in
clear
outline
the
rules
of
behaviour
by
observing
which
they
will
attain
the
maximum
of
happiness
it
still
remains
quite
doubtful
how
far
it
would
be
desirable
for
us
to
imitate
these
rules
in
the
circumstances
in
which
we
now
live
for
this
foreknown
social
order
is
only
presented
as
a
more
advanced
stage
in
our
social
progress
and
not
as
a
type
or
pattern
which
we
ought
to
make
a
struggle
to
realise
approximately
at
an
earlier
stage
how
far
it
should
be
taken
as
such
a
pattern
is
a
question
which
would
still
have
to
be
determined
and
in
the
consideration
of
it
the
effects
of
our
actions
on
the
existing
generation
would
after
all
be
the
most
important
element
footnotes
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
latter
ought
properly
to
be
termed
a
good
citizen
and
not
rather
a
faithful
subject
of
the
czar
of
but
this
doubt
only
illustrates
the
divergence
to
which
i
am
drawing
attention
sometimes
as
before
observed
politics
appears
to
be
used
in
a
wider
sense
to
denote
the
theory
of
ideal
social
relations
whether
conceived
to
be
established
through
governmental
coercion
or
otherwise
in
writing
this
section
i
had
primarily
in
view
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
spencer
s
as
spencer
has
restated
his
view
and
replied
to
my
arguments
in
his
of
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
point
out
that
the
first
paragraph
of
this
section
is
not
directed
against
such
a
view
of
absolute
and
relative
ethics
as
is
given
in
the
later
treatise
which
seems
to
me
to
differ
materially
from
the
doctrine
of
in
it
is
maintained
not
merely
as
in
the
of
that
absolute
ethics
which
formulates
normal
conduct
in
an
ideal
society
ought
to
take
precedence
of
relative
ethics
but
that
absolute
ethics
is
the
only
kind
of
ethics
with
which
a
philosophical
moralist
can
possibly
concern
himself
to
quote
spencer
s
words
any
proposed
system
of
morals
which
recognises
existing
defects
and
countenances
acts
made
needful
by
them
stands
moral
law
requires
as
its
postulate
that
human
beings
be
perfect
the
philosophical
moralist
treats
solely
of
the
man
shows
in
what
relationship
he
stands
to
other
straight
men
a
problem
in
which
a
man
forms
one
of
the
elements
is
insoluble
by
chap
still
more
definitely
is
relative
ethics
excluded
in
the
following
passage
of
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
same
treatise
the
italics
are
mine
it
will
very
likely
be
urged
that
whereas
the
perfect
moral
code
is
confessedly
beyond
the
fulfilment
of
imperfect
men
some
other
code
is
needful
for
our
present
guidance
to
say
that
the
imperfect
man
requires
a
moral
code
which
recognises
his
imperfection
and
allows
for
it
at
first
sight
it
is
not
really
a
system
of
morals
which
shall
recognise
man
s
present
imperfections
and
allow
for
them
be
devised
and
would
be
useless
if
it
could
be
i
omit
for
the
present
the
consideration
of
the
method
which
takes
perfection
as
an
ultimate
end
since
as
has
been
before
observed
it
is
hardly
possible
to
discuss
this
satisfactorily
in
relation
to
the
present
question
until
it
has
been
somewhat
more
clearly
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
intuitional
method
some
further
consideration
of
this
question
will
be
found
in
a
subsequent
chapter
cf
book
iv
chap
iv
chapter
iii
ethical
judgments
in
the
first
chapter
i
spoke
of
actions
that
we
judge
to
be
right
and
what
ought
to
be
done
as
being
reasonable
or
rational
and
similarly
of
ultimate
ends
as
prescribed
by
reason
and
i
contrasted
the
motive
to
action
supplied
by
the
recognition
of
such
reasonableness
with
desires
and
inclinations
this
manner
of
speaking
is
employed
by
writers
of
different
schools
and
seems
in
accordance
with
the
common
view
and
language
on
the
subject
for
we
commonly
think
that
wrong
conduct
is
essentially
irrational
and
can
be
shown
to
be
so
by
argument
and
though
we
do
not
conceive
that
it
is
by
reason
alone
that
men
are
influenced
to
act
rightly
we
still
hold
that
appeals
to
the
reason
are
an
essential
part
of
all
moral
persuasion
and
that
part
which
concerns
the
moralist
or
moral
philosopher
as
distinct
from
the
preacher
or
moral
rhetorician
on
the
other
hand
it
is
widely
maintained
that
as
hume
says
reason
meaning
the
judgment
of
truth
and
falsehood
can
never
of
itself
be
any
motive
to
the
will
and
that
the
motive
to
action
is
in
all
cases
some
desire
including
under
this
term
the
impulses
to
action
given
by
present
pleasure
and
pain
it
seems
desirable
to
examine
with
some
care
the
grounds
of
this
contention
before
we
proceed
any
further
let
us
begin
by
defining
the
issue
raised
as
clearly
as
possible
every
one
i
suppose
has
had
experience
of
what
is
meant
by
the
conflict
of
or
irrational
desires
with
reason
most
of
us
occasionally
feel
bodily
appetite
prompting
us
to
indulgences
which
we
judge
to
be
imprudent
and
anger
prompting
us
to
acts
which
we
disapprove
as
unjust
or
unkind
it
is
when
this
conflict
occurs
that
the
desires
are
said
to
be
irrational
as
impelling
us
to
volitions
opposed
to
our
deliberate
judgments
sometimes
we
yield
to
such
seductive
impulses
and
sometimes
not
and
it
is
perhaps
when
we
do
yield
that
the
impulsive
force
of
such
irrational
desires
is
most
definitely
felt
as
we
have
to
exert
in
resisting
them
a
voluntary
effort
somewhat
analogous
to
that
involved
in
any
muscular
exertion
often
again
since
we
are
not
always
thinking
either
of
our
duty
or
of
our
interest
desires
of
this
kind
take
effect
in
voluntary
actions
without
our
having
judged
such
actions
to
be
either
right
or
wrong
either
prudent
or
imprudent
as
when
an
ordinary
healthy
man
eats
his
dinner
in
such
cases
it
seems
most
appropriate
to
call
the
desires
rather
than
neither
term
is
intended
to
imply
that
the
desires
spoken
of
or
at
least
the
more
important
of
them
are
not
normally
accompanied
by
intellectual
processes
it
is
true
that
some
impulses
to
action
seem
to
take
effect
as
we
say
blindly
or
instinctively
without
any
definite
consciousness
either
of
the
end
at
which
the
action
is
aimed
or
of
the
means
by
which
the
end
is
to
be
attained
but
this
i
conceive
is
only
the
case
with
impulses
that
do
not
occupy
consciousness
for
an
appreciable
time
and
ordinarily
do
not
require
any
but
very
familiar
and
habitual
actions
for
the
attainment
of
their
proximate
ends
in
all
other
cases
that
is
in
the
case
of
the
actions
with
which
we
are
chiefly
concerned
in
ethical
discussion
the
result
aimed
at
and
some
part
at
least
of
the
means
by
which
it
is
to
be
realised
are
more
or
less
distinctly
represented
in
consciousness
previous
to
the
volition
that
initiates
the
movements
tending
to
its
realisation
hence
the
resultant
forces
of
what
i
call
desires
and
the
volitions
to
which
they
prompt
are
continually
modified
by
intellectual
processes
in
two
distinct
ways
first
by
new
perceptions
or
representations
of
means
conducive
to
the
desired
ends
and
secondly
by
new
presentations
or
representations
of
facts
actually
existing
or
in
prospect
especially
more
or
less
probable
consequences
of
contemplated
actions
which
rouse
new
impulses
of
desire
and
aversion
the
question
then
is
whether
the
account
just
given
of
the
influence
of
the
intellect
on
desire
and
volition
is
not
exhaustive
and
whether
the
experience
which
is
commonly
described
as
a
conflict
of
desire
with
reason
is
not
more
properly
conceived
as
merely
a
conflict
among
desires
and
aversions
the
sole
function
of
reason
being
to
bring
before
the
mind
ideas
of
actual
or
possible
facts
which
modify
in
the
manner
above
described
the
resultant
force
of
our
various
impulses
i
hold
that
this
is
not
the
case
that
the
ordinary
moral
or
prudential
judgments
which
in
the
case
of
all
or
most
minds
have
some
though
often
an
inadequate
influence
on
volition
can
not
legitimately
be
interpreted
as
judgments
respecting
the
present
or
future
existence
of
human
feelings
or
any
facts
of
the
sensible
world
the
fundamental
notion
represented
by
the
word
ought
or
right
which
such
judgments
contain
expressly
or
by
implication
being
essentially
different
from
all
notions
representing
facts
of
physical
or
psychical
experience
the
question
is
one
on
which
appeal
must
ultimately
be
made
to
the
reflection
of
individuals
on
their
practical
judgments
and
reasonings
and
in
making
this
appeal
it
seems
most
convenient
to
begin
by
showing
the
inadequacy
of
all
attempts
to
explain
the
practical
judgments
or
propositions
in
which
this
fundamental
notion
is
introduced
without
recognising
its
unique
character
as
above
negatively
defined
there
is
an
element
of
truth
in
such
explanations
in
so
far
as
they
bring
into
view
feelings
which
undoubtedly
accompany
moral
or
prudential
judgments
and
which
ordinarily
have
more
or
less
effect
in
determining
the
will
to
actions
judged
to
be
right
but
so
far
as
they
profess
to
be
interpretations
of
what
such
judgments
mean
they
appear
to
me
to
fail
altogether
in
considering
this
question
it
is
important
to
take
separately
the
two
species
of
judgments
which
i
have
distinguished
as
moral
and
both
kinds
might
indeed
be
termed
moral
in
a
wider
sense
and
as
we
saw
it
is
a
strongly
supported
opinion
that
all
valid
moral
rules
have
ultimately
a
prudential
basis
but
in
ordinary
thought
we
clearly
distinguish
cognitions
or
judgments
of
duty
from
cognitions
or
judgments
as
to
what
is
right
or
ought
to
be
done
in
view
of
the
agent
s
private
interest
or
happiness
and
the
depth
of
the
distinction
will
not
i
think
be
diminished
by
the
closer
examination
of
these
judgments
on
which
we
are
now
to
enter
this
very
distinction
however
suggests
an
interpretation
of
the
notion
of
rightness
which
denies
its
peculiar
significance
in
moral
judgments
it
is
urged
that
rightness
is
properly
an
attribute
of
means
not
of
ends
so
that
the
attribution
of
it
merely
implies
that
the
act
judged
right
is
the
fittest
or
only
fit
means
to
the
realisation
of
some
end
understood
if
not
expressly
stated
and
similarly
that
the
affirmation
that
anything
ought
to
be
done
is
always
made
with
at
least
tacit
reference
to
some
ulterior
end
and
i
grant
that
this
is
a
legitimate
interpretation
in
respect
of
a
part
of
the
use
of
either
term
in
ordinary
discourse
but
it
seems
clear
that
certain
kinds
of
actions
under
the
names
of
justice
veracity
good
faith
are
commonly
held
to
be
right
unconditionally
without
regard
to
ulterior
results
and
that
we
similarly
regard
as
right
the
adoption
of
certain
ends
such
as
the
common
good
of
society
or
general
happiness
in
either
of
these
cases
the
interpretation
above
suggested
seems
clearly
inadmissible
we
have
therefore
to
find
a
meaning
for
right
or
what
ought
to
be
other
than
the
notion
of
fitness
to
some
ulterior
end
here
we
are
met
by
the
suggestion
that
the
judgments
or
propositions
which
we
commonly
call
moral
in
the
narrower
sense
really
affirm
no
more
than
the
existence
of
a
specific
emotion
in
the
mind
of
the
person
who
utters
them
that
when
i
say
truth
ought
to
be
spoken
or
truthspeaking
is
right
i
mean
no
more
than
that
the
idea
of
truthspeaking
excites
in
my
mind
a
feeling
of
approbation
or
satisfaction
and
probably
some
degree
of
such
emotion
commonly
distinguished
as
moral
sentiment
ordinarily
accompanies
moral
judgments
on
real
cases
but
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
a
mere
statement
of
my
approbation
of
is
properly
given
in
the
proposition
truth
ought
to
be
spoken
otherwise
the
fact
of
another
man
s
disapprobation
might
equally
be
expressed
by
saying
truth
ought
not
to
be
spoken
and
thus
we
should
have
two
coexistent
facts
stated
in
two
mutually
contradictory
propositions
this
is
so
obvious
that
we
must
suppose
that
those
who
hold
the
view
which
i
am
combating
do
not
really
intend
to
deny
it
but
rather
to
maintain
that
this
subjective
fact
of
my
approbation
is
all
that
there
is
any
for
stating
or
perhaps
that
it
is
all
that
any
reasonable
person
is
prepared
on
reflection
to
affirm
and
no
doubt
there
is
a
large
class
of
statements
in
form
objective
which
yet
we
are
not
commonly
prepared
to
maintain
as
more
than
subjective
if
their
validity
is
questioned
if
i
say
that
the
air
is
sweet
or
the
food
disagreeable
it
would
not
be
exactly
true
to
say
that
i
mean
no
more
than
that
i
like
the
one
or
dislike
the
other
but
if
my
statement
is
challenged
i
shall
probably
content
myself
with
affirming
the
existence
of
such
feelings
in
my
own
mind
but
there
appears
to
me
to
be
a
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
that
of
moral
feelings
the
peculiar
emotion
of
moral
approbation
is
in
my
experience
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
conviction
implicit
or
explicit
that
the
conduct
approved
is
really
right
that
it
can
not
without
error
be
disapproved
by
any
other
mind
if
i
give
up
this
conviction
because
others
do
not
share
it
or
for
any
other
reason
i
may
no
doubt
still
retain
a
sentiment
prompting
to
the
conduct
in
question
or
what
is
perhaps
more
common
a
sentiment
of
repugnance
to
the
opposite
conduct
but
this
sentiment
will
no
longer
have
the
special
quality
of
moral
sentiment
strictly
so
called
this
difference
between
the
two
is
often
overlooked
in
ethical
discussion
but
any
experience
of
a
change
in
moral
opinion
produced
by
argument
may
afford
an
illustration
of
it
suppose
that
any
one
habitually
influenced
by
the
sentiment
of
veracity
is
convinced
that
under
certain
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
he
finds
himself
speaking
truth
is
not
right
but
wrong
he
will
probably
still
feel
a
repugnance
against
violating
the
rule
of
truthspeaking
but
it
will
be
a
feeling
quite
different
in
kind
and
degree
from
that
which
prompted
him
to
veracity
as
a
department
of
virtuous
action
we
might
perhaps
call
the
one
a
moral
and
the
other
a
sentiment
the
argument
just
given
holds
equally
against
the
view
that
approbation
or
disapprobation
is
not
the
mere
liking
or
aversion
of
an
individual
for
certain
kinds
of
conduct
but
this
complicated
by
a
sympathetic
representation
of
similar
likings
or
aversions
felt
by
other
human
beings
no
doubt
such
sympathy
is
a
normal
concomitant
of
moral
emotion
and
when
the
former
is
absent
there
is
much
greater
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
latter
this
however
is
partly
because
our
moral
beliefs
commonly
agree
with
those
of
other
members
of
our
society
and
on
this
agreement
depends
to
an
important
extent
our
confidence
in
the
truth
of
these
beliefs
but
if
as
in
the
case
just
supposed
we
are
really
led
by
argument
to
a
new
moral
belief
opposed
not
only
to
our
own
habitual
sentiment
but
also
to
that
of
the
society
in
which
we
live
we
have
a
crucial
experiment
proving
the
existence
in
us
of
moral
sentiments
as
i
have
defined
them
colliding
with
the
represented
sympathies
of
our
no
less
than
with
our
own
mere
likings
and
aversions
and
even
if
we
imagine
the
sympathies
opposed
to
our
convictions
extended
until
they
include
those
of
the
whole
human
race
against
whom
we
imagine
ourselves
to
stand
as
contra
still
so
long
as
our
conviction
of
duty
is
firm
the
emotion
which
we
call
moral
stands
out
in
imagination
quite
distinct
from
the
complex
sympathy
opposed
to
it
however
much
we
extend
complicate
and
intensify
the
latter
so
far
then
from
being
prepared
to
admit
that
the
proposition
x
ought
to
be
done
expresses
the
existence
of
a
certain
sentiment
in
myself
or
others
i
find
it
strictly
impossible
so
to
regard
my
own
moral
judgments
without
eliminating
from
the
concomitant
sentiment
the
peculiar
quality
signified
by
the
term
there
is
however
another
interpretation
of
ought
in
which
the
likings
and
aversions
that
men
in
general
feel
for
certain
kinds
of
conduct
are
considered
not
as
sympathetically
represented
in
the
emotion
of
the
person
judging
and
thus
constituting
the
moral
element
in
it
but
as
causes
of
pain
to
the
person
of
whom
ought
or
duty
is
predicated
on
this
view
when
we
say
that
a
man
ought
to
do
anything
or
that
it
is
his
duty
to
do
it
we
mean
that
he
is
bound
under
penalties
to
do
it
the
particular
penalty
considered
being
the
pain
that
will
accrue
to
him
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
dislike
of
his
i
think
that
this
interpretation
expresses
a
part
of
the
meaning
with
which
the
words
ought
and
duty
are
used
in
ordinary
thought
and
discourse
for
we
commonly
use
the
term
moral
obligation
as
equivalent
to
duty
and
expressing
what
is
implied
in
the
verb
ought
thus
suggesting
an
analogy
between
this
notion
and
that
of
legal
obligation
and
in
the
case
of
positive
law
we
can
not
refuse
to
recognise
the
connexion
of
obligation
and
punishment
a
law
can
not
be
properly
said
to
be
actually
established
in
a
society
if
it
is
habitually
violated
with
impunity
but
a
more
careful
reflection
on
the
relation
of
law
to
morality
as
ordinarily
conceived
seems
to
show
that
this
interpretation
of
ought
though
it
can
not
be
excluded
must
be
distinguished
from
the
special
ethical
use
of
the
term
for
the
ideal
distinction
taken
in
common
thought
between
legal
and
merely
moral
rules
seems
to
lie
in
just
this
connexion
of
the
former
but
not
the
latter
with
punishment
we
think
that
there
are
some
things
which
a
man
ought
to
be
compelled
to
do
or
forbear
and
others
which
he
ought
to
do
or
forbear
without
compulsion
and
that
the
former
alone
fall
properly
within
the
sphere
of
law
no
doubt
we
also
think
that
in
many
cases
where
the
compulsion
of
law
is
undesirable
the
fear
of
moral
censure
and
its
consequences
supplies
a
normally
useful
constraint
on
the
will
of
any
individual
but
it
is
evident
that
what
we
mean
when
we
say
that
a
man
is
morally
though
not
legally
bound
to
do
a
thing
is
not
merely
that
he
will
be
punished
by
public
opinion
if
he
does
not
for
we
often
join
these
two
statements
clearly
distinguishing
their
import
and
further
since
public
opinion
is
known
to
be
eminently
fallible
there
are
many
things
which
we
judge
men
ought
to
do
while
perfectly
aware
that
they
will
incur
no
serious
social
penalties
for
omitting
them
in
such
cases
indeed
it
would
be
commonly
said
that
social
disapprobation
ought
to
follow
on
immoral
conduct
and
in
this
very
assertion
it
is
clear
that
the
term
ought
can
not
mean
that
social
penalties
are
to
be
feared
by
those
who
do
not
disapprove
again
all
or
most
men
in
whom
the
moral
consciousness
is
strongly
developed
find
themselves
from
time
to
time
in
conflict
with
the
commonly
received
morality
of
the
society
to
which
they
belong
and
thus
as
was
before
said
have
a
crucial
experience
proving
that
duty
does
not
mean
what
other
men
will
disapprove
of
them
for
not
doing
at
the
same
time
i
admit
as
indeed
i
have
already
suggested
in
of
chap
that
we
not
unfrequently
pass
judgments
resembling
moral
judgments
in
form
and
not
distinguished
from
them
in
ordinary
thought
in
cases
where
the
obligation
affirmed
is
found
on
reflection
to
depend
on
the
existence
of
current
opinions
and
sentiments
as
such
the
members
of
modern
civilised
societies
are
under
the
sway
of
a
code
of
public
opinion
enforced
by
social
penalties
which
no
reflective
person
obeying
it
identifies
with
the
moral
code
or
regards
as
unconditionally
binding
indeed
the
code
is
manifestly
fluctuating
and
variable
different
at
the
same
time
in
different
classes
professions
social
circles
of
the
same
political
community
such
a
code
always
supports
to
a
considerable
extent
the
commonly
received
code
of
morality
and
most
reflective
persons
think
it
generally
reasonable
to
conform
to
the
dictates
of
public
opinion
to
the
code
of
honour
we
may
say
in
graver
matters
or
the
rules
of
politeness
or
good
breeding
in
lighter
matters
wherever
these
dictates
do
not
positively
conflict
with
morality
such
conformity
being
maintained
either
on
grounds
of
private
interest
or
because
it
is
thought
conducive
to
general
happiness
or
wellbeing
to
keep
as
much
as
possible
in
harmony
with
one
s
hence
in
the
ordinary
thought
of
unreflective
persons
the
duties
imposed
by
social
opinion
are
often
undistinguished
from
moral
duties
and
indeed
this
indistinctness
is
almost
inherent
in
the
common
meaning
of
many
terms
for
instance
if
we
say
that
a
man
has
been
dishonoured
by
a
cowardly
act
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
we
mean
that
he
has
incurred
contempt
or
that
he
has
deserved
it
or
both
as
becomes
evident
when
we
take
a
case
in
which
the
code
of
honour
comes
into
conflict
with
morality
if
a
man
were
to
incur
social
ostracism
anywhere
for
refusing
a
duel
on
religious
grounds
some
would
say
that
he
was
dishonoured
though
he
had
acted
rightly
others
that
there
could
be
no
real
dishonour
in
a
virtuous
act
a
similar
ambiguity
seems
to
lurk
in
the
common
notion
of
improper
or
incorrect
behaviour
still
in
all
such
cases
the
ambiguity
becomes
evident
on
reflection
and
when
discovered
merely
serves
to
illustrate
further
the
distinction
between
the
notion
of
right
conduct
duty
what
we
ought
or
are
under
moral
obligation
to
do
when
these
terms
are
used
in
a
strictly
ethical
sense
and
conduct
that
is
merely
conformed
to
the
standard
of
current
opinion
there
is
however
another
way
of
interpreting
ought
as
connoting
penalties
which
is
somewhat
less
easy
to
meet
by
a
crucial
psychological
experiment
the
moral
imperative
may
be
taken
to
be
a
law
of
god
to
the
breach
of
which
divine
penalties
are
annexed
and
these
no
doubt
in
a
christian
society
are
commonly
conceived
to
be
adequate
and
universally
applicable
still
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
belief
is
shared
by
all
the
persons
whose
conduct
is
influenced
by
independent
moral
convictions
occasionally
unsupported
either
by
the
law
or
the
public
opinion
of
their
community
and
even
in
the
case
of
many
of
those
who
believe
fully
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
the
judgment
i
ought
to
do
this
can
not
be
identified
with
the
judgment
god
will
punish
me
if
i
do
not
since
the
conviction
that
the
former
proposition
is
true
is
distinctly
recognised
as
an
important
part
of
the
grounds
for
believing
the
latter
again
when
christians
speak
as
they
commonly
do
of
the
justice
or
other
moral
attributes
of
god
as
exhibited
in
punishing
sinners
and
rewarding
the
righteous
they
obviously
imply
not
merely
that
god
thus
punish
and
reward
but
that
it
is
right
for
him
to
do
so
which
of
course
can
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
he
is
bound
under
it
seems
then
that
the
notion
of
ought
or
moral
obligation
as
used
in
our
common
moral
judgments
does
not
merely
import
that
there
exists
in
the
mind
of
the
person
judging
a
specific
emotion
whether
complicated
or
not
by
sympathetic
representation
of
similar
emotions
in
other
minds
nor
that
certain
rules
of
conduct
are
supported
by
penalties
which
will
follow
on
their
violation
whether
such
penalties
result
from
the
general
liking
or
aversion
felt
for
the
conduct
prescribed
or
forbidden
or
from
some
other
source
what
then
it
may
be
asked
does
it
import
what
definition
can
we
give
of
ought
right
and
other
terms
expressing
the
same
fundamental
notion
to
this
i
should
answer
that
the
notion
which
these
terms
have
in
common
is
too
elementary
to
admit
of
any
formal
definition
in
so
saying
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
it
belongs
to
the
original
constitution
of
the
mind
that
its
presence
in
consciousness
is
not
the
result
of
a
process
of
development
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
whole
fabric
of
human
thought
including
the
conceptions
that
present
themselves
as
most
simple
and
elementary
has
been
developed
through
a
gradual
process
of
psychical
change
out
of
some
lower
life
in
which
thought
properly
speaking
had
no
place
but
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
inferred
as
regards
this
or
any
other
notion
that
it
has
not
really
the
simplicity
which
it
appears
to
have
when
we
now
reflect
upon
it
it
is
sometimes
assumed
that
if
we
can
show
how
thoughts
have
grown
up
if
we
can
point
to
the
psychical
antecedents
of
which
they
are
the
natural
consequents
we
may
conclude
that
the
thoughts
in
question
are
really
compounds
containing
their
antecedents
as
latent
elements
but
i
know
no
justification
for
this
transference
of
the
conceptions
of
chemistry
to
psychology
i
know
no
reason
for
considering
psychical
antecedents
as
really
constitutive
of
their
psychical
consequents
in
spite
of
the
apparent
dissimilarity
between
the
two
in
default
of
such
reasons
a
psychologist
must
accept
as
elementary
what
introspection
carefully
performed
declares
to
be
so
and
using
this
criterion
i
find
that
the
notion
we
have
been
examining
as
it
now
exists
in
our
thought
can
not
be
resolved
into
any
more
simple
notions
it
can
only
be
made
clearer
by
determining
as
precisely
as
possible
its
relation
to
other
notions
with
which
it
is
connected
in
ordinary
thought
especially
to
those
with
which
it
is
liable
to
be
confounded
in
performing
this
process
it
is
important
to
note
and
distinguish
two
different
implications
with
which
the
word
ought
is
used
in
the
narrowest
ethical
sense
what
we
judge
ought
to
be
done
is
always
thought
capable
of
being
brought
about
by
the
volition
of
any
individual
to
whom
the
judgment
applies
i
can
not
conceive
that
i
ought
to
do
anything
which
at
the
same
time
i
judge
that
i
can
not
do
in
a
wider
sense
however
which
can
not
conveniently
be
discarded
i
sometimes
judge
that
i
ought
to
know
what
a
wiser
man
would
know
or
feel
as
a
better
man
would
feel
in
my
place
though
i
may
know
that
i
could
not
directly
produce
in
myself
such
knowledge
or
feeling
by
any
effort
of
will
in
this
case
the
word
merely
implies
an
ideal
or
pattern
which
i
ought
in
the
stricter
sense
to
seek
to
imitate
as
far
as
possible
and
this
wider
sense
seems
to
be
that
in
which
the
word
is
normally
used
in
the
precepts
of
art
generally
and
in
political
judgments
when
i
judge
that
the
laws
and
constitution
of
my
country
ought
to
be
other
than
they
are
i
do
not
of
course
imply
that
my
own
or
any
other
individual
s
single
volition
can
directly
bring
about
the
change
in
either
case
however
i
imply
that
what
ought
to
be
is
a
possible
object
of
knowledge
that
what
i
judge
ought
to
be
must
unless
i
am
in
error
be
similarly
judged
by
all
rational
beings
who
judge
truly
of
the
matter
in
referring
such
judgments
to
the
reason
i
do
not
mean
here
to
prejudge
the
question
whether
valid
moral
judgments
are
normally
attained
by
a
process
of
reasoning
from
universal
principles
or
axioms
or
by
direct
intuition
of
the
particular
duties
of
individuals
it
is
not
uncommonly
held
that
the
moral
faculty
deals
primarily
with
individual
cases
as
they
arise
applying
directly
to
each
case
the
general
notion
of
duty
and
deciding
intuitively
what
ought
to
be
done
by
this
person
in
these
particular
circumstances
and
i
admit
that
on
this
view
the
apprehension
of
moral
truth
is
more
analogous
to
than
to
rational
intuition
as
commonly
understood
and
hence
the
term
moral
sense
might
seem
more
appropriate
but
the
term
sense
suggests
a
capacity
for
feelings
which
may
vary
from
to
without
either
being
in
error
rather
than
a
faculty
of
cognition
and
it
appears
to
me
fundamentally
important
to
avoid
this
suggestion
i
have
therefore
thought
it
better
to
use
the
term
reason
with
the
explanation
above
given
to
denote
the
faculty
of
moral
cognition
adding
as
a
further
justification
of
this
use
that
even
when
a
moral
judgment
relates
primarily
to
some
particular
action
we
commonly
regard
it
as
applicable
to
any
other
action
belonging
to
a
certain
definable
class
so
that
the
moral
truth
apprehended
is
implicitly
conceived
to
be
intrinsically
universal
though
particular
in
our
first
apprehension
of
it
further
when
i
speak
of
the
cognition
or
judgment
that
x
ought
to
be
done
in
the
stricter
ethical
sense
of
the
term
ought
as
a
dictate
or
precept
of
reason
to
the
persons
to
whom
it
relates
i
imply
that
in
rational
beings
as
such
this
cognition
gives
an
impulse
or
motive
to
action
though
in
human
beings
of
course
this
is
only
one
motive
among
others
which
are
liable
to
conflict
with
it
and
is
not
always
perhaps
not
usually
a
predominant
motive
in
fact
this
possible
conflict
of
motives
seems
to
be
connoted
by
the
term
dictate
or
imperative
which
describes
the
relation
of
reason
to
mere
inclinations
or
impulses
by
comparing
it
to
the
relation
between
the
will
of
a
superior
and
the
wills
of
his
subordinates
this
conflict
seems
also
to
be
implied
in
the
terms
ought
duty
moral
obligation
as
used
in
ordinary
moral
discourse
and
hence
these
terms
can
not
be
applied
to
the
actions
of
rational
beings
to
whom
we
can
not
attribute
impulses
conflicting
with
reason
we
may
however
say
of
such
beings
that
their
actions
are
reasonable
or
in
an
absolute
sense
i
am
aware
that
some
persons
will
be
disposed
to
answer
all
the
preceding
argument
by
a
simple
denial
that
they
can
find
in
their
consciousness
any
such
unconditional
or
categorical
imperative
as
i
have
been
trying
to
exhibit
if
this
is
really
the
final
result
of
in
any
case
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
at
least
do
not
know
how
to
impart
the
notion
of
moral
obligation
to
any
one
who
is
entirely
devoid
of
it
i
think
however
that
many
of
those
who
give
this
denial
only
mean
to
deny
that
they
have
any
consciousness
of
moral
obligation
to
actions
without
reference
to
their
consequences
and
would
not
really
deny
that
they
recognise
some
universal
end
or
ends
whether
it
be
the
general
happiness
or
otherwise
understood
as
that
at
which
it
is
ultimately
reasonable
to
aim
subordinating
to
its
attainment
the
gratification
of
any
personal
desires
that
may
conflict
with
this
aim
but
in
this
view
as
i
have
before
said
the
unconditional
imperative
plainly
comes
in
as
regards
the
end
which
is
explicitly
or
implicitly
recognised
as
an
end
at
which
all
men
ought
to
aim
and
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
the
recognition
of
an
end
as
ultimately
reasonable
involves
the
recognition
of
an
obligation
to
do
such
acts
as
most
conduce
to
the
end
the
obligation
is
not
indeed
unconditional
but
it
does
not
depend
on
the
existence
of
any
desires
or
aversions
and
nothing
that
has
been
said
in
the
preceding
section
is
intended
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
intuitionism
as
against
utilitarianism
or
any
other
method
that
treats
moral
rules
as
relative
to
general
good
or
for
instance
nothing
that
i
have
said
is
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
truthspeaking
is
only
valuable
as
a
means
to
the
preservation
of
society
only
if
it
be
admitted
that
it
valuable
on
this
ground
i
should
say
that
it
is
implied
that
the
preservation
of
society
or
some
further
end
to
which
this
preservation
again
is
a
means
must
be
valuable
and
therefore
something
at
which
a
rational
being
as
such
ought
to
aim
if
it
be
granted
that
we
need
not
look
beyond
the
preservation
of
society
the
primary
dictate
of
reason
in
this
case
would
be
that
society
to
be
preserved
but
reason
would
also
dictate
that
truth
ought
to
be
spoken
so
far
as
truthspeaking
is
recognised
as
the
indispensable
or
fittest
means
to
this
end
and
the
notion
ought
as
used
in
either
dictate
is
that
which
i
have
been
trying
to
make
clear
so
again
even
those
who
hold
that
moral
rules
are
only
obligatory
because
it
is
the
individual
s
interest
to
conform
to
them
thus
regarding
them
as
a
particular
species
of
prudential
rules
do
not
thereby
get
rid
of
the
dictate
of
reason
so
far
as
they
recognise
private
interest
or
happiness
as
an
end
at
which
it
is
ultimately
reasonable
to
aim
the
conflict
of
practical
reason
with
irrational
desire
remains
an
indubitable
fact
of
our
conscious
experience
even
if
practical
reason
is
interpreted
to
mean
merely
prudence
it
is
indeed
maintained
by
kant
and
others
that
it
can
not
properly
be
said
to
be
a
man
s
duty
to
promote
his
own
happiness
since
what
every
one
inevitably
wills
can
not
be
brought
under
the
notion
of
but
even
granting
it
to
be
in
some
sense
true
that
a
man
s
volition
is
always
directed
to
the
attainment
of
his
own
happiness
it
does
not
follow
that
a
man
always
does
what
he
believes
will
be
conducive
to
his
own
happiness
as
butler
urges
it
is
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
men
indulge
appetite
or
passion
even
when
in
their
own
view
the
indulgence
is
as
clearly
opposed
to
what
they
conceive
to
be
their
interest
as
it
is
to
what
they
conceive
to
be
their
duty
thus
the
notion
ought
as
expressing
the
relation
of
rational
judgment
to
impulses
will
find
a
place
in
the
practical
rules
of
any
egoistic
system
no
less
than
in
the
rules
of
ordinary
morality
understood
as
prescribing
duty
without
reference
to
the
agent
s
interest
here
however
it
may
be
held
that
egoism
does
not
properly
regard
the
agent
s
own
greatest
happiness
as
what
he
ought
to
aim
at
but
only
as
the
ultimate
end
for
the
realisation
of
which
he
has
on
the
whole
a
predominant
desire
which
may
be
temporarily
overcome
by
particular
passions
and
appetites
but
ordinarily
regains
its
predominance
when
these
transient
impulses
have
spent
their
force
i
quite
recognise
that
this
is
a
view
widely
taken
of
egoistic
action
and
i
propose
to
consider
it
in
a
subsequent
chapter
but
even
if
we
discard
the
belief
that
any
end
of
action
is
unconditionally
or
categorically
prescribed
by
reason
the
notion
ought
as
above
explained
is
not
thereby
eliminated
from
our
practical
reasonings
it
still
remains
in
the
hypothetical
imperative
which
prescribes
the
fittest
means
to
any
end
that
we
may
have
determined
to
aim
at
when
a
physician
says
if
you
wish
to
be
healthy
you
ought
to
rise
early
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
early
rising
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
attainment
of
this
latter
proposition
expresses
the
relation
of
physiological
facts
on
which
the
former
is
founded
but
it
is
not
merely
this
relation
of
facts
that
the
word
ought
imports
it
also
implies
the
unreasonableness
of
adopting
an
end
and
refusing
to
adopt
the
means
indispensable
to
its
attainment
it
may
perhaps
be
argued
that
this
is
not
only
unreasonable
but
impossible
since
adoption
of
an
end
means
the
preponderance
of
a
desire
for
it
and
if
aversion
to
the
indispensable
means
causes
them
not
to
be
adopted
although
recognised
as
indispensable
the
desire
for
the
end
is
preponderant
and
it
ceases
to
be
adopted
but
this
view
is
due
in
my
opinion
to
a
defective
psychological
analysis
according
to
my
observation
of
consciousness
the
adoption
of
an
end
as
paramount
either
absolutely
or
within
certain
limits
is
quite
a
distinct
psychical
phenomenon
from
desire
it
is
a
kind
of
volition
though
it
is
of
course
specifically
different
from
a
volition
initiating
a
particular
immediate
action
as
a
species
intermediate
between
the
two
we
may
place
resolutions
to
act
in
a
certain
way
at
some
future
time
we
continually
make
such
resolutions
and
sometimes
when
the
time
comes
for
carrying
them
out
we
do
in
fact
act
otherwise
under
the
influence
of
passion
or
mere
habit
without
consciously
cancelling
our
previous
resolve
this
inconsistency
of
will
our
practical
reason
condemns
as
irrational
even
apart
from
any
judgment
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
on
either
volition
considered
by
itself
there
is
a
similar
inconsistency
between
the
adoption
of
an
end
and
a
general
refusal
to
take
whatever
means
we
may
see
to
be
indispensable
to
its
attainment
and
if
when
the
time
comes
we
do
not
take
such
means
while
yet
we
do
not
consciously
retract
our
adoption
of
the
end
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
we
ought
in
consistency
to
act
otherwise
than
we
do
and
such
a
contradiction
as
i
have
described
between
a
general
resolution
and
a
particular
volition
is
surely
a
matter
of
common
experience
footnotes
the
difference
between
the
significations
of
the
two
words
is
discussed
later
as
for
instance
when
bentham
explains
of
morals
and
chap
i
note
that
his
fundamental
principle
states
the
greatest
happiness
of
all
those
whose
interest
is
in
question
as
being
the
right
and
proper
end
of
human
action
we
can
not
understand
him
really
to
by
the
word
right
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
though
his
language
in
other
passages
of
the
same
chapter
ix
and
x
would
seem
to
imply
this
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
conducive
to
general
happiness
to
take
general
happiness
as
an
end
of
action
though
not
exactly
a
tautology
can
hardly
serve
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
a
moral
system
see
book
iii
chap
xi
ought
is
here
inapplicable
for
a
reason
presently
explained
in
chemistry
we
regard
the
antecedents
elements
as
still
existing
in
and
constituting
the
consequent
compound
because
the
latter
is
exactly
similar
to
the
former
in
weight
and
because
we
can
generally
cause
this
compound
to
disappear
and
obtain
the
elements
in
its
place
but
we
find
nothing
at
all
like
this
in
the
growth
of
mental
phenomena
the
psychical
consequent
is
in
no
respect
exactly
similar
to
its
antecedents
nor
can
it
be
resolved
into
them
i
should
explain
that
i
am
not
here
arguing
the
question
whether
the
of
moral
judgments
is
affected
by
a
discovery
of
their
psychical
antecedents
this
question
i
reserve
for
subsequent
discussion
see
book
iii
chap
i
i
do
not
even
imply
that
any
combination
of
individuals
could
completely
realise
the
state
of
political
relations
which
i
conceive
ought
to
exist
my
conception
would
be
futile
if
it
had
no
relation
to
practice
but
it
may
merely
delineate
a
pattern
to
which
no
more
than
an
approximation
is
practically
possible
we
do
not
commonly
say
that
particular
physical
facts
are
apprehended
by
the
reason
we
consider
this
faculty
to
be
conversant
in
its
discursive
operation
with
the
relation
of
judgments
or
propositions
and
the
intuitive
reason
which
is
here
rather
in
question
we
restrict
to
the
apprehension
of
universal
truths
such
as
the
axioms
of
logic
and
mathematics
by
cognition
i
always
mean
what
some
would
rather
call
apparent
cognition
that
is
i
do
not
mean
to
affirm
the
of
the
cognition
but
only
its
existence
as
a
psychical
fact
and
its
claim
to
be
valid
a
further
justification
for
this
extended
use
of
the
term
reason
will
be
suggested
in
a
subsequent
chapter
of
this
book
chap
viii
this
is
the
sense
in
which
the
term
will
always
be
used
in
the
present
treatise
except
where
the
context
makes
it
quite
clear
that
only
the
wider
meaning
that
of
the
political
ought
is
applicable
as
will
be
seen
from
the
next
chapter
i
do
not
grant
this
chap
ix
of
this
book
chapter
iv
pleasure
and
desire
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
have
left
undetermined
the
emotional
characteristics
of
the
impulse
that
prompts
us
to
obey
the
dictates
of
reason
i
have
done
so
because
these
seem
to
be
very
different
in
different
minds
and
even
to
vary
much
and
rapidly
in
the
same
mind
without
any
corresponding
variation
in
the
volitional
direction
of
the
impulse
for
instance
in
the
mind
of
a
rational
egoist
the
ruling
impulse
is
generally
what
butler
and
hutcheson
call
a
calm
or
cool
whereas
in
the
man
who
takes
universal
happiness
as
the
end
and
standard
of
right
conduct
the
desire
to
do
what
is
judged
to
be
reasonable
as
such
is
commonly
blended
in
varying
degrees
with
sympathy
and
philanthropic
enthusiasm
again
if
one
conceives
the
dictating
reason
whatever
its
dictates
may
be
as
external
to
oneself
the
cognition
of
rightness
is
accompanied
by
a
sentiment
of
reverence
for
authority
which
may
by
some
be
conceived
impersonally
but
is
more
commonly
regarded
as
the
authority
of
a
supreme
person
so
that
the
sentiment
blends
with
the
affections
normally
excited
by
persons
in
different
relations
and
becomes
religious
this
conception
of
reason
as
an
external
authority
against
which
the
rebels
is
often
irresistibly
forced
on
the
reflective
mind
at
other
times
however
the
identity
of
reason
and
self
presents
itself
as
an
immediate
conviction
and
then
reverence
for
authority
passes
over
into
and
the
opposite
and
even
more
powerful
sentiment
of
freedom
is
called
in
if
we
consider
the
rational
self
as
liable
to
be
enslaved
by
the
usurping
force
of
sensual
impulses
quite
different
again
are
the
emotions
of
aspiration
or
admiration
aroused
by
the
conception
of
virtue
as
an
ideal
of
moral
beauty
other
phases
of
emotion
might
be
mentioned
all
having
with
these
the
common
characteristic
that
they
are
inseparable
from
an
apparent
cognition
implicit
or
explicit
direct
or
indirect
of
in
the
conduct
to
which
they
prompt
there
are
no
doubt
important
differences
in
the
moral
value
and
efficacy
of
these
different
emotions
to
which
i
shall
hereafter
call
attention
but
their
primary
practical
effect
does
not
appear
to
vary
so
long
as
the
cognition
of
rightness
remains
unchanged
it
is
then
with
these
cognitions
that
ethics
in
my
view
is
primarily
concerned
its
object
is
to
free
them
from
doubt
and
error
and
systematise
them
as
far
as
possible
there
is
however
one
view
of
the
feelings
which
prompt
to
voluntary
action
which
is
sometimes
thought
to
cut
short
all
controversy
as
to
the
principles
on
which
such
action
ought
to
be
regulated
i
mean
the
view
that
volition
is
always
determined
by
pleasures
or
pains
actual
or
prospective
this
doctrine
which
i
may
distinguish
as
psychological
hedonism
is
often
connected
and
not
seldom
confounded
with
the
method
of
ethics
which
i
have
called
egoistic
hedonism
and
no
doubt
it
seems
at
first
sight
a
natural
inference
that
if
one
end
of
action
my
own
pleasure
or
absence
of
pain
is
definitely
determined
for
me
by
unvarying
psychological
laws
a
different
end
can
not
be
prescribed
for
me
by
reason
reflection
however
shows
that
this
inference
involves
the
unwarranted
assumption
that
a
man
s
pleasure
and
pain
are
determined
independently
of
his
moral
judgments
whereas
it
is
manifestly
possible
that
our
prospect
of
pleasure
resulting
from
any
course
of
conduct
may
largely
depend
on
our
conception
of
it
as
right
or
otherwise
and
in
fact
the
psychological
theory
above
mentioned
would
require
us
to
suppose
that
this
is
normally
the
case
with
conscientious
persons
who
habitually
act
in
accordance
with
their
moral
convictions
the
connexion
of
the
expectation
of
pleasure
from
an
act
with
the
judgment
that
it
is
right
may
be
different
in
different
cases
we
commonly
conceive
a
truly
moral
man
as
one
who
finds
pleasure
in
doing
what
he
judges
to
be
right
because
he
so
judges
it
but
even
where
moral
sensibility
is
weak
expectation
of
pleasure
from
an
act
may
be
a
necessary
consequent
of
a
judgment
that
it
is
right
through
a
belief
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
somehow
harmonising
virtue
and
i
therefore
conclude
that
there
is
no
necessary
connexion
between
the
psychological
proposition
that
pleasure
or
absence
of
pain
to
myself
is
always
the
actual
ultimate
end
of
my
action
and
the
ethical
proposition
that
my
own
greatest
happiness
or
pleasure
is
for
me
the
ultimate
end
it
may
however
be
replied
that
if
the
former
proposition
be
accepted
in
the
same
quantitatively
precise
form
as
the
latter
if
it
is
admitted
that
i
must
by
a
law
of
my
nature
always
aim
at
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
or
least
pain
to
myself
then
at
least
i
can
not
conceive
any
aim
conflicting
with
this
to
be
prescribed
by
reason
and
this
seems
to
me
undeniable
if
as
bentham
affirms
on
the
occasion
of
every
act
he
exercises
every
human
being
is
inevitably
led
to
pursue
that
line
of
conduct
which
according
to
his
view
of
the
case
taken
by
him
at
the
moment
will
be
in
the
highest
degree
contributory
to
his
own
greatest
happiness
then
to
any
one
who
knows
this
it
must
become
inconceivable
that
reason
dictates
to
him
to
pursue
any
other
line
of
conduct
but
at
the
same
time
as
it
seems
to
me
the
proposition
that
he
ought
to
pursue
line
of
conduct
becomes
no
less
clearly
incapable
of
being
affirmed
with
any
significance
for
a
psychological
law
invariably
realised
in
my
conduct
does
not
admit
of
being
conceived
as
a
precept
or
dictate
of
reason
this
latter
must
be
a
rule
from
which
i
am
conscious
that
it
is
possible
to
deviate
i
do
not
however
think
that
the
proposition
quoted
from
bentham
would
be
affirmed
without
qualification
by
any
of
the
writers
who
now
maintain
psychological
hedonism
they
would
admit
with
mill
that
men
often
not
from
merely
intellectual
deficiencies
but
from
infirmity
of
character
make
their
election
for
the
nearer
good
though
they
know
it
to
be
less
valuable
and
this
no
less
when
the
choice
is
between
two
bodily
pleasures
they
pursue
sensual
indulgences
to
the
injury
of
health
though
perfectly
aware
that
health
is
the
greater
this
being
so
egoistic
hedonism
becomes
a
possible
ethical
ideal
to
which
psychological
hedonism
seems
to
point
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
ultimate
aim
of
each
of
us
in
acting
is
always
solely
pleasure
or
absence
of
pain
to
himself
the
demonstration
certainly
suggests
that
each
to
seek
his
own
pleasure
as
has
been
said
no
cogent
inference
is
possible
from
the
psychological
generalisation
to
the
ethical
principle
but
the
mind
has
a
natural
tendency
to
pass
from
the
one
position
to
the
other
if
the
actual
ultimate
springs
of
our
volition
are
always
our
own
pleasures
and
pains
it
seems
reasonable
to
be
moved
by
them
in
proportion
to
their
pleasantness
and
painfulness
and
therefore
to
choose
the
greatest
pleasure
or
least
pain
on
the
whole
further
this
psychological
doctrine
seems
to
conflict
with
an
ethical
view
widely
held
by
persons
whose
moral
consciousness
is
highly
developed
viz
that
an
act
to
be
in
the
highest
sense
virtuous
must
not
be
done
solely
for
the
sake
of
the
attendant
pleasure
even
if
that
be
the
pleasure
of
the
moral
sense
so
that
if
i
do
an
act
from
the
sole
desire
of
obtaining
the
glow
of
moral
which
i
believe
will
attend
its
performance
the
act
will
not
be
truly
virtuous
it
seems
therefore
important
to
subject
psychological
hedonism
even
in
its
more
indefinite
form
to
a
careful
examination
it
will
be
well
to
begin
by
defining
more
precisely
the
question
at
issue
first
i
will
concede
that
pleasure
is
a
kind
of
feeling
which
stimulates
the
will
to
actions
tending
to
sustain
or
produce
it
to
sustain
it
if
actually
present
and
to
produce
it
if
it
be
only
represented
in
idea
and
similarly
pain
is
a
kind
of
feeling
which
stimulates
to
actions
tending
to
remove
or
avert
it
it
seems
convenient
to
call
the
felt
volitional
stimulus
in
the
two
cases
respectively
desire
and
aversion
though
it
should
be
observed
that
the
former
term
is
ordinarily
restricted
to
the
impulse
felt
when
pleasure
is
not
actually
present
but
only
represented
in
idea
the
question
at
issue
then
is
not
whether
pleasure
present
or
represented
is
normally
accompanied
by
an
impulse
to
prolong
the
actual
or
realise
the
represented
feeling
and
pain
correspondingly
by
aversion
but
whether
there
are
no
desires
and
aversions
which
have
not
pleasures
and
pains
for
their
objects
no
conscious
impulses
to
produce
or
avert
results
other
than
the
agent
s
own
feelings
in
the
treatise
to
which
i
have
referred
mill
explains
that
desiring
a
thing
and
finding
it
pleasant
are
in
the
strictness
of
language
two
modes
of
naming
the
same
psychological
if
this
be
the
case
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
proposition
we
are
discussing
requires
to
be
determined
by
practised
and
as
the
denial
of
it
would
involve
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
truth
is
that
an
ambiguity
in
the
word
pleasure
has
tended
to
confuse
the
discussion
of
this
question
when
we
speak
of
a
man
doing
something
at
his
pleasure
or
as
he
pleases
we
usually
signify
the
mere
fact
of
voluntary
choice
not
necessarily
that
the
result
aimed
at
is
some
prospective
feeling
of
the
chooser
now
if
by
pleasant
we
merely
mean
that
which
influences
choice
exercises
a
certain
attractive
force
on
the
will
it
is
an
assertion
incontrovertible
because
tautological
to
say
that
we
desire
what
is
pleasant
or
even
that
we
desire
a
thing
in
proportion
as
it
appears
pleasant
but
if
we
take
pleasure
to
denote
the
kind
of
feelings
above
defined
it
becomes
a
really
debateable
question
whether
the
end
to
which
our
desires
are
always
consciously
directed
is
the
attainment
by
ourselves
of
such
feelings
and
this
is
what
we
must
understand
mill
to
consider
so
obvious
that
it
will
hardly
be
it
is
rather
curious
to
find
that
one
of
the
of
english
moralists
regards
the
exact
opposite
of
what
mill
thinks
so
obvious
as
being
not
merely
a
universal
fact
of
our
conscious
experience
but
even
a
necessary
truth
butler
as
is
well
known
distinguishes
or
the
impulse
towards
our
own
pleasure
from
particular
movements
towards
particular
external
objects
honour
power
the
harm
or
good
of
another
the
actions
proceeding
from
which
are
no
otherwise
interested
than
as
every
action
of
every
creature
must
from
the
nature
of
the
case
be
for
no
one
can
act
but
from
a
desire
or
choice
or
preference
of
his
such
particular
passions
or
appetites
are
he
goes
on
to
say
presupposed
by
the
very
of
an
interested
pursuit
since
the
very
idea
of
interest
or
happiness
consists
in
this
that
an
appetite
or
affection
enjoys
its
we
could
not
pursue
pleasure
at
all
unless
we
had
desires
for
something
else
than
pleasure
for
pleasure
consists
in
the
satisfaction
of
just
these
disinterested
impulses
butler
has
certainly
his
case
so
far
as
my
own
experience
goes
for
many
pleasures
especially
those
of
sight
hearing
and
smell
together
with
many
emotional
pleasures
occur
to
me
without
any
perceptible
relation
to
previous
desires
and
it
seems
quite
that
our
primary
desires
might
be
entirely
directed
towards
such
pleasures
as
these
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
appears
to
me
that
throughout
the
whole
scale
of
my
impulses
sensual
emotional
and
intellectual
alike
i
can
distinguish
desires
of
which
the
object
is
something
other
than
my
own
pleasure
i
will
begin
by
taking
an
illustration
of
this
from
the
impulses
commonly
placed
lowest
in
the
scale
the
appetite
of
hunger
so
far
as
i
can
observe
is
a
direct
impulse
to
the
eating
of
food
such
eating
is
no
doubt
commonly
attended
with
an
agreeable
feeling
of
more
or
less
intensity
but
it
can
not
i
think
be
strictly
said
that
this
agreeable
feeling
is
the
object
of
hunger
and
that
it
is
the
representation
of
this
pleasure
which
stimulates
the
will
of
the
hungry
man
as
such
of
course
hunger
is
frequently
and
naturally
accompanied
with
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
of
eating
but
careful
introspection
seems
to
show
that
the
two
are
by
no
means
inseparable
and
even
when
they
occur
together
the
pleasure
seems
properly
the
object
not
of
the
primary
appetite
but
of
a
secondary
desire
which
can
be
distinguished
from
the
former
since
the
in
whom
this
secondary
desire
is
strong
is
often
prompted
by
it
to
actions
designed
to
stimulate
hunger
and
often
again
is
led
to
control
the
primary
impulse
in
order
to
prolong
and
vary
the
process
of
satisfying
it
indeed
it
is
so
obvious
that
hunger
is
something
different
from
the
desire
for
anticipated
pleasure
that
some
writers
have
regarded
its
volitional
stimulus
and
that
of
desire
generally
as
a
case
of
aversion
from
present
pain
this
however
seems
to
me
a
distinct
mistake
in
psychological
classification
no
doubt
desire
is
a
state
of
consciousness
so
far
similar
to
pain
that
in
both
we
feel
a
stimulus
prompting
us
to
pass
from
the
present
state
into
a
different
one
but
aversion
from
pain
is
an
impulse
to
get
out
of
the
present
state
and
pass
into
some
other
state
which
is
only
negatively
represented
as
different
from
the
present
whereas
in
desire
as
such
the
primary
impulse
is
towards
the
realisation
of
some
positive
future
result
it
is
true
that
when
a
strong
desire
is
for
any
reason
baulked
of
its
effect
in
causing
action
it
is
generally
painful
in
some
degree
and
so
a
secondary
aversion
to
the
state
of
desire
is
generated
which
blends
itself
with
the
desire
and
may
easily
be
confounded
with
it
but
here
again
we
may
distinguish
the
two
impulses
by
observing
the
different
kinds
of
conduct
to
which
they
occasionally
prompt
for
the
aversion
to
the
pain
of
ungratified
desire
though
it
may
act
as
an
additional
stimulus
towards
the
gratification
of
the
desire
may
also
and
often
does
prompt
us
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
by
suppressing
the
desire
the
question
whether
all
desire
has
in
some
degree
the
quality
of
pain
is
one
of
psychological
rather
than
ethical
interest
so
long
as
it
is
admitted
that
it
is
often
not
painful
in
any
degree
comparable
to
its
intensity
as
desire
so
that
its
volitional
impulse
can
not
be
explained
as
a
case
of
aversion
to
its
own
painfulness
at
the
same
time
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
i
have
no
hesitation
in
answering
the
question
in
the
negative
consider
again
the
case
of
hunger
i
certainly
do
not
find
hunger
as
an
element
of
my
normal
life
at
all
a
painful
feeling
it
only
becomes
painful
when
i
am
in
ill
health
or
when
the
satisfaction
of
the
appetite
is
abnormally
delayed
and
generally
speaking
any
desire
that
is
not
felt
to
be
thwarted
in
its
primary
impulse
to
actions
tending
to
its
satisfaction
is
not
only
not
itself
a
painful
feeling
even
when
this
attainment
is
still
remote
but
is
often
an
element
of
a
state
of
consciousness
which
as
a
whole
is
highly
pleasurable
indeed
the
pleasures
afforded
by
the
consciousness
of
eager
activity
in
which
desire
is
an
essential
element
constitute
a
considerable
item
in
the
total
enjoyment
of
life
it
is
almost
a
commonplace
to
say
that
such
pleasures
which
we
may
call
generally
the
pleasures
of
pursuit
are
more
important
than
the
pleasures
of
attainment
and
in
many
cases
it
is
the
prospect
of
the
former
rather
than
of
the
latter
that
induces
us
to
engage
in
a
pursuit
in
such
cases
it
is
peculiarly
easy
to
distinguish
the
desire
to
attain
the
object
pursued
from
a
desire
of
the
pleasure
of
attainment
since
the
attainment
only
becomes
pleasant
in
prospect
because
the
pursuit
itself
stimulates
a
desire
for
what
is
pursued
take
for
example
the
case
of
any
game
which
involves
as
most
games
do
a
contest
for
victory
no
ordinary
player
before
entering
on
such
a
contest
has
any
desire
for
victory
in
it
indeed
he
often
finds
it
difficult
to
imagine
himself
deriving
gratification
from
such
victory
before
he
has
actually
engaged
in
the
competition
what
he
deliberately
before
the
game
begins
desires
is
not
victory
but
the
pleasant
excitement
of
the
struggle
for
it
only
for
the
full
development
of
this
pleasure
a
transient
desire
to
win
the
game
is
generally
indispensable
this
desire
which
does
not
exist
at
first
is
stimulated
to
considerable
intensity
by
the
competition
itself
and
in
proportion
as
it
is
thus
stimulated
both
the
mere
contest
becomes
more
pleasurable
and
the
victory
which
was
originally
indifferent
comes
to
afford
a
keen
enjoyment
the
same
phenomenon
is
exhibited
in
the
case
of
more
important
kinds
of
pursuit
thus
it
often
happens
that
a
man
feeling
his
life
languid
and
devoid
of
interests
begins
to
occupy
himself
in
the
prosecution
of
some
scientific
or
socially
useful
work
for
the
sake
not
of
the
end
but
of
the
occupation
at
first
very
likely
the
occupation
is
irksome
but
soon
as
he
foresaw
a
desire
to
attain
the
end
at
which
he
aims
is
stimulated
partly
by
sympathy
with
other
workers
partly
by
his
sustained
exercise
of
voluntary
effort
directed
towards
it
so
that
his
pursuit
becoming
eager
becomes
also
a
source
of
pleasure
here
again
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
in
proportion
as
his
desire
for
the
end
grows
strong
the
attainment
of
it
becomes
pleasant
in
prospect
but
it
would
be
a
palpable
mistake
to
say
that
this
prospective
pleasure
is
the
object
of
the
desire
that
causes
it
when
we
compare
these
pleasures
with
those
previously
discussed
another
important
observation
suggests
itself
in
the
former
case
though
we
could
distinguish
appetite
as
it
appears
in
consciousness
from
the
desire
of
the
pleasure
attending
the
satisfaction
of
appetite
there
appeared
to
be
no
incompatibility
between
the
two
the
fact
that
a
glutton
is
dominated
by
the
desire
of
the
pleasures
of
eating
in
no
way
impedes
the
development
in
him
of
the
appetite
which
is
a
necessary
condition
of
these
pleasures
but
when
we
turn
to
the
pleasures
of
pursuit
we
seem
to
perceive
this
incompatibility
to
a
certain
extent
a
certain
subordination
of
seems
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
full
enjoyment
a
man
who
maintains
throughout
an
epicurean
mood
keeping
his
main
conscious
aim
perpetually
fixed
on
his
own
pleasure
does
not
catch
the
full
spirit
of
the
chase
his
eagerness
never
gets
just
the
sharpness
of
edge
which
imparts
to
the
pleasure
its
highest
zest
here
comes
into
view
what
we
may
call
the
fundamental
paradox
of
hedonism
that
the
impulse
towards
pleasure
if
too
predominant
defeats
its
own
aim
this
effect
is
not
visible
or
at
any
rate
is
scarcely
visible
in
the
case
of
passive
sensual
pleasures
but
of
our
active
enjoyments
generally
whether
the
activities
on
which
they
attend
are
classed
as
bodily
or
as
intellectual
as
well
as
of
many
emotional
pleasures
it
may
certainly
be
said
that
we
can
not
attain
them
at
least
in
their
highest
degree
so
long
as
we
keep
our
main
conscious
aim
concentrated
upon
them
it
is
not
only
that
the
exercise
of
our
faculties
is
insufficiently
stimulated
by
the
mere
desire
of
the
pleasure
attending
it
and
requires
the
presence
of
other
more
objective
impulses
in
order
to
be
fully
developed
we
may
go
further
and
say
that
these
other
impulses
must
be
temporarily
predominant
and
absorbing
if
the
exercise
and
its
attendant
gratification
are
to
attain
their
full
scope
many
englishmen
would
maintain
the
view
that
business
is
more
agreeable
than
amusement
but
they
would
hardly
find
it
so
if
they
transacted
the
business
with
a
perpetual
conscious
aim
at
the
attendant
pleasure
similarly
the
pleasures
of
thought
and
study
can
only
be
enjoyed
in
the
highest
degree
by
those
who
have
an
ardour
of
curiosity
which
carries
the
mind
temporarily
away
from
self
and
its
sensations
in
all
kinds
of
art
again
the
exercise
of
the
creative
faculty
is
attended
by
intense
and
exquisite
pleasures
but
it
would
seem
that
in
order
to
get
them
one
must
forget
them
the
genuine
artist
at
work
seems
to
have
a
predominant
and
temporarily
absorbing
desire
for
the
realisation
of
his
ideal
of
beauty
the
important
case
of
the
benevolent
affections
is
at
first
sight
somewhat
more
doubtful
on
the
one
hand
it
is
of
course
true
that
when
those
whom
we
love
are
pleased
or
pained
we
ourselves
feel
sympathetic
pleasure
and
pain
and
further
that
the
flow
of
love
or
kindly
feeling
is
itself
highly
pleasurable
so
that
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
interpret
benevolent
actions
as
aiming
ultimately
at
the
attainment
of
one
or
both
of
these
two
kinds
of
pleasures
or
at
the
averting
of
sympathetic
pain
from
the
agent
but
we
may
observe
first
that
the
impulse
to
beneficent
action
produced
in
us
by
sympathy
is
often
so
much
out
of
proportion
to
any
actual
consciousness
of
sympathetic
pleasure
and
pain
in
ourselves
that
it
would
be
paradoxical
to
regard
this
latter
as
its
object
often
indeed
we
can
not
but
feel
that
a
tale
of
actual
suffering
arouses
in
us
an
excitement
on
the
whole
more
pleasurable
than
painful
like
the
excitement
of
witnessing
a
tragedy
and
yet
at
the
same
time
stirs
in
us
an
impulse
to
relieve
it
even
when
the
process
of
relieving
is
painful
and
laborious
and
involves
various
sacrifices
of
our
own
pleasures
again
we
may
often
free
ourselves
from
sympathetic
pain
most
easily
by
merely
turning
our
thoughts
from
the
external
suffering
that
causes
it
and
we
sometimes
feel
an
egoistic
impulse
to
do
this
which
we
can
then
distinguish
clearly
from
the
properly
sympathetic
impulse
prompting
us
to
relieve
the
original
suffering
and
finally
the
pleasures
of
benevolence
seem
to
require
in
order
to
be
felt
in
any
considerable
degree
the
of
a
desire
to
do
good
to
others
for
their
sake
and
not
for
our
own
as
hutcheson
explains
we
may
benevolent
affection
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasures
attending
it
just
as
the
glutton
cultivates
appetite
but
we
can
not
produce
it
at
will
however
strong
may
be
our
desire
of
these
pleasures
and
when
it
exists
even
though
it
may
owe
its
origin
to
a
purely
egoistic
impulse
it
is
still
essentially
a
desire
to
do
good
to
others
for
their
sake
and
not
for
our
own
it
can
not
perhaps
be
said
that
the
and
which
seemed
an
essential
condition
of
the
full
development
of
the
other
elevated
impulses
before
noticed
characterise
benevolent
affection
normally
and
permanently
as
love
when
a
powerful
emotion
seems
naturally
to
involve
a
desire
for
reciprocated
love
strong
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
of
the
emotion
and
thus
the
consciousness
of
self
and
of
one
s
own
pleasures
and
pains
seems
often
heightened
by
the
very
intensity
of
the
affection
that
binds
one
to
others
still
we
may
at
least
say
that
this
and
absorption
of
consciousness
in
the
thought
of
other
human
beings
and
their
happiness
is
a
common
incident
of
all
strong
affections
and
it
is
said
that
persons
who
love
intensely
sometimes
feel
a
sense
of
antagonism
between
the
egoistic
and
altruistic
elements
of
their
desire
and
an
impulse
to
suppress
the
former
which
occasionally
exhibits
itself
in
acts
of
fantastic
and
extravagant
if
then
reflection
on
our
moral
consciousness
seems
to
show
that
the
pleasure
of
virtue
is
one
which
can
only
be
obtained
on
the
express
condition
of
its
not
being
the
object
sought
we
need
not
distrust
this
result
of
observation
on
account
of
the
abnormal
nature
of
the
phenomenon
we
have
merely
another
illustration
of
a
psychological
law
which
as
we
have
seen
is
exemplified
throughout
the
whole
range
of
our
desires
in
the
promptings
of
sense
no
less
than
in
those
of
intellect
or
reason
we
find
the
phenomenon
of
strictly
disinterested
impulse
base
and
trivial
external
ends
may
excite
desires
of
this
kind
as
well
as
the
sublime
and
ideal
and
there
are
pleasures
of
the
merely
animal
life
which
can
only
be
obtained
on
condition
of
not
being
directly
sought
no
less
than
the
satisfactions
of
a
good
conscience
so
far
i
have
been
concerned
to
insist
on
the
felt
incompatibility
of
and
impulses
only
as
a
means
of
proving
their
essential
distinctness
i
do
not
wish
to
overstate
this
incompatibility
i
believe
that
most
commonly
it
is
very
transient
and
often
only
momentary
and
that
our
greatest
happiness
if
that
be
our
deliberate
aim
is
generally
attained
by
means
of
a
sort
of
alternating
rhythm
of
the
two
kinds
of
impulse
in
consciousness
a
man
s
conscious
desire
is
i
think
more
often
than
not
chiefly
but
where
there
is
strong
desire
in
any
direction
there
is
commonly
keen
susceptibility
to
the
corresponding
pleasures
and
the
most
devoted
enthusiast
is
sustained
in
his
work
by
the
recurrent
consciousness
of
such
pleasures
but
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
familiar
and
obvious
instances
of
conflict
between
and
some
impulse
are
not
paradoxes
and
illusions
to
be
explained
away
but
phenomena
which
the
analysis
of
our
consciousness
in
its
normal
state
when
there
is
no
such
conflict
would
lead
us
to
expect
if
we
are
continually
acting
from
impulses
whose
immediate
objects
are
something
other
than
our
own
happiness
it
is
quite
natural
that
we
should
occasionally
yield
to
such
impulses
when
they
prompt
us
to
an
uncompensated
sacrifice
of
pleasure
thus
a
man
of
weak
after
fasting
too
long
may
easily
indulge
his
appetite
for
food
to
an
extent
which
he
knows
to
be
unwholesome
and
that
not
because
the
pleasure
of
eating
appears
to
him
even
in
the
moment
of
indulgence
at
all
worthy
of
consideration
in
comparison
with
the
injury
to
health
but
merely
because
he
feels
an
impulse
to
eat
food
which
prevails
over
his
prudential
judgment
thus
again
men
have
sacrificed
all
the
enjoyments
of
life
and
even
life
itself
to
obtain
posthumous
fame
not
from
any
illusory
belief
that
they
would
be
somehow
capable
of
deriving
pleasure
from
it
but
from
a
direct
desire
of
the
future
admiration
of
others
and
a
preference
of
it
to
their
own
pleasure
and
so
again
when
the
sacrifice
is
made
for
some
ideal
end
as
truth
or
freedom
or
religion
it
may
be
a
real
sacrifice
of
the
individual
s
happiness
and
not
merely
the
preference
of
one
highly
refined
pleasure
or
of
the
absence
of
one
special
pain
to
all
the
other
elements
of
happiness
no
doubt
this
preference
is
possible
a
man
may
feel
that
the
high
and
severe
delight
of
serving
his
ideal
is
a
pearl
of
great
price
outweighing
in
value
all
other
pleasures
but
he
may
also
feel
that
the
sacrifice
will
not
repay
and
yet
determine
that
it
shall
be
made
to
sum
up
our
conscious
active
impulses
are
so
far
from
being
always
directed
towards
the
attainment
of
pleasure
or
avoidance
of
pain
for
ourselves
that
we
can
find
everywhere
in
consciousness
impulses
directed
towards
something
that
is
not
pleasure
nor
relief
from
pain
and
indeed
a
most
important
part
of
our
pleasure
depends
upon
the
existence
of
such
impulses
while
on
the
other
hand
they
are
in
many
cases
so
far
incompatible
with
the
desire
of
our
own
pleasure
that
the
two
kinds
of
impulse
do
not
easily
coexist
in
the
same
moment
of
consciousness
and
more
occasionally
but
by
no
means
rarely
the
two
come
into
irreconcilable
conflict
and
prompt
to
opposite
courses
of
action
and
this
incompatibility
though
it
is
important
to
notice
it
in
other
instances
is
no
doubt
specially
prominent
in
the
case
of
the
impulse
towards
the
end
which
most
markedly
competes
in
ethical
controversy
with
pleasure
the
love
of
virtue
for
its
own
sake
or
desire
to
do
what
is
right
as
such
the
psychological
observations
on
which
my
argument
is
based
will
not
perhaps
be
directly
controverted
at
least
to
such
an
extent
as
to
involve
my
main
conclusion
but
there
are
two
lines
of
reasoning
by
which
it
has
been
attempted
to
weaken
the
force
of
this
conclusion
without
directly
denying
it
in
the
first
place
it
is
urged
that
pleasure
though
not
the
only
conscious
aim
of
human
action
is
yet
always
the
result
to
which
it
is
unconsciously
directed
the
proposition
would
be
difficult
to
disprove
since
no
one
denies
that
pleasure
in
some
degree
normally
accompanies
the
attainment
of
a
desired
end
and
when
once
we
go
beyond
the
testimony
of
consciousness
there
seems
to
be
no
clear
method
of
determining
which
among
the
consequences
of
any
action
is
the
end
at
which
it
is
aimed
for
the
same
reason
however
the
proposition
is
at
any
rate
equally
difficult
to
prove
but
i
should
go
further
and
maintain
that
if
we
seriously
set
ourselves
to
consider
human
action
on
its
unconscious
side
we
can
only
conceive
it
as
a
combination
of
movements
of
the
parts
of
a
material
organism
and
that
if
we
try
to
ascertain
what
the
end
in
any
case
of
such
movements
is
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
it
is
some
material
result
some
organic
condition
conducive
to
the
preservation
either
of
the
individual
organism
or
of
the
race
to
which
it
belongs
in
fact
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
or
the
absence
of
pain
is
the
end
of
all
human
action
can
neither
be
supported
by
the
results
of
introspection
nor
by
the
results
of
external
observation
and
inference
it
rather
seems
to
be
reached
by
an
arbitrary
and
illegitimate
combination
of
the
two
but
again
it
is
sometimes
said
that
whatever
be
the
case
with
our
present
adult
consciousness
our
original
impulses
were
all
directed
towards
pleasure
or
from
pain
and
that
any
impulses
otherwise
directed
are
derived
from
these
by
association
of
i
can
find
no
evidence
that
even
tends
to
prove
this
so
far
as
we
can
observe
the
consciousness
of
children
the
two
elements
impulse
and
desire
for
pleasure
seem
to
coexist
in
the
same
manner
as
they
do
in
mature
life
in
so
far
as
there
is
any
difference
it
seems
to
be
in
the
opposite
direction
as
the
actions
of
children
being
more
instinctive
and
less
reflective
are
more
prompted
by
impulse
and
less
by
conscious
aim
at
pleasure
no
doubt
the
two
kinds
of
impulse
as
we
trace
back
the
development
of
consciousness
gradually
become
indistinguishable
but
this
obviously
does
not
justify
us
in
identifying
with
either
of
the
two
the
more
indefinite
impulse
out
of
which
both
have
been
developed
but
even
supposing
it
were
found
that
our
earliest
appetites
were
all
merely
appetites
for
pleasure
it
would
have
little
bearing
on
the
present
question
what
i
am
concerned
to
maintain
is
that
men
do
not
normally
desire
pleasure
alone
but
to
an
important
extent
other
things
also
some
in
particular
having
impulses
towards
virtue
which
may
and
do
conflict
with
their
conscious
desire
for
their
own
pleasure
to
say
in
answer
to
this
that
all
men
desired
pleasure
is
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
irrelevant
except
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
original
type
of
man
s
appetitive
nature
to
which
as
such
it
is
right
or
best
for
him
to
conform
but
probably
no
hedonist
would
expressly
maintain
this
though
such
an
assumption
no
doubt
is
frequently
made
by
writers
of
the
intuitional
school
some
psychologists
regard
desire
as
essentially
painful
this
view
seems
to
me
erroneous
according
to
the
ordinary
use
of
the
term
and
though
it
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
confusion
against
which
i
am
chiefly
concerned
to
guard
in
the
present
chapter
between
the
volitional
stimulus
of
desire
itself
and
the
volitional
stimulus
of
aversion
to
desire
as
painful
it
has
some
tendency
to
cause
this
confusion
it
may
therefore
be
worth
while
to
point
out
that
the
difference
of
opinion
between
myself
and
the
psychologists
in
question
of
whom
i
select
bain
as
a
leading
example
depends
largely
though
not
entirely
on
a
difference
of
definition
in
chap
viii
of
the
second
division
of
his
book
on
emotions
and
the
bain
defines
desire
as
that
phase
of
volition
where
there
is
a
motive
and
not
ability
to
act
on
it
and
gives
the
following
illustration
the
inmate
of
a
small
gloomy
chamber
conceives
to
himself
the
pleasure
of
light
and
of
an
expanded
prospect
the
unsatisfying
ideal
urges
the
appropriate
action
for
gaining
the
reality
he
gets
up
and
walks
out
suppose
now
that
the
same
ideal
delight
comes
into
the
mind
of
a
prisoner
unable
to
fulfil
the
prompting
he
remains
under
the
solicitation
of
the
motive
and
his
state
is
denominated
craving
longing
appetite
desire
if
all
motive
impulses
could
be
at
once
followed
up
desire
would
have
no
place
there
is
a
bar
in
the
way
of
acting
which
leads
to
the
state
of
conflict
and
renders
desire
a
more
or
less
painful
state
of
now
i
agree
that
desire
is
most
frequently
painful
in
some
degree
when
the
person
desiring
is
inhibited
from
acting
for
the
attainment
of
the
desired
object
i
do
not
indeed
think
that
even
under
these
circumstances
it
is
always
painful
especially
when
it
is
accompanied
with
hope
take
the
simple
case
of
hunger
ordinarily
when
i
am
looking
forward
to
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
i
do
not
find
hunger
painful
unless
i
have
fasted
unusually
long
although
custom
and
a
regard
for
my
digestion
prevent
me
from
satisfying
the
appetite
till
the
soup
is
served
still
i
admit
that
when
action
tending
to
fruition
is
excluded
desire
is
very
liable
to
be
painful
but
it
is
surely
contrary
to
usage
to
restrict
the
term
desire
to
this
case
suppose
bain
s
prisoner
becomes
possessed
of
a
file
and
sees
his
way
to
getting
out
of
prison
by
a
long
process
which
will
involve
among
other
operations
the
filing
of
certain
bars
it
would
surely
seem
absurd
to
say
that
his
desire
finally
ceases
when
the
operation
of
filing
begins
no
doubt
the
concentration
of
attention
on
the
complex
activities
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
freedom
is
likely
to
cause
the
prisoner
to
be
so
absorbed
by
other
ideas
and
feelings
that
the
desire
of
freedom
may
temporarily
cease
to
be
present
in
his
consciousness
but
as
the
stimulus
on
which
his
whole
activity
ultimately
depends
is
certainly
derived
from
the
unrealised
idea
of
freedom
this
idea
with
the
concomitant
feeling
of
desire
will
normally
recur
at
brief
intervals
during
the
process
similarly
in
other
cases
while
it
is
quite
true
that
men
often
work
for
a
desired
end
without
consciously
feeling
desire
for
the
end
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
they
never
feel
desire
while
so
working
at
any
rate
this
restricted
use
of
the
term
has
never
i
think
been
adopted
by
ethical
writers
in
treating
of
desire
and
in
some
passages
bain
himself
seems
to
adopt
a
wider
meaning
he
says
for
instance
in
the
chapter
from
which
i
have
quoted
that
we
have
a
form
of
desire
we
are
working
for
distant
if
then
it
be
allowed
that
the
feeling
of
desire
is
at
any
rate
sometimes
an
element
of
consciousness
coexisting
with
a
process
of
activity
directed
to
the
attainment
of
the
desired
object
or
intervening
in
the
brief
pauses
of
such
a
process
i
venture
to
think
that
when
the
feeling
is
observed
under
these
conditions
it
will
not
be
found
in
accordance
with
the
common
experience
of
mankind
to
describe
it
as
essentially
painful
take
as
a
simple
instance
the
case
of
a
game
involving
bodily
exercise
and
a
contest
of
skill
probably
many
persons
who
take
part
in
such
exercises
for
sanitary
or
social
purposes
begin
without
any
perceptible
desire
to
win
the
game
and
probably
as
long
as
they
remain
thus
indifferent
the
exercise
is
rather
tedious
usually
however
a
conscious
desire
to
win
the
game
is
excited
as
a
consequence
of
actions
directed
towards
this
end
and
in
my
experience
at
least
in
proportion
as
the
feeling
grows
strong
the
whole
process
becomes
more
pleasurable
if
this
be
admitted
to
be
a
normal
experience
it
must
surely
be
also
admitted
that
desire
in
this
case
is
a
feeling
in
which
introspection
does
not
enable
us
to
detect
the
slightest
quality
of
pain
it
would
be
easy
to
give
an
indefinite
number
of
similar
instances
of
energetic
activity
carried
on
for
an
end
whether
in
sport
or
in
the
serious
business
of
life
where
a
keen
desire
for
the
attainment
of
the
end
in
view
is
indispensable
to
a
real
enjoyment
of
the
labour
required
to
attain
and
where
at
the
same
time
we
can
not
detect
any
painfulness
in
the
desire
however
much
we
try
to
separate
it
in
introspective
analysis
from
its
concomitant
feeling
the
error
that
i
am
trying
to
remove
seems
to
me
partly
due
to
overlooking
these
cases
and
contemplating
exclusively
cases
in
which
desire
is
for
some
reason
or
other
prevented
from
having
its
normal
effect
in
stimulating
activity
directed
to
the
attainment
of
the
desired
object
partly
however
it
seems
to
be
due
to
the
resemblance
between
desire
and
pain
to
which
i
have
drawn
attention
in
the
text
of
this
chapter
the
which
is
undoubtedly
a
characteristic
of
the
state
of
desire
and
ordinarily
of
pain
for
the
characteristic
of
unrestfulness
requires
some
care
to
distinguish
it
from
uneasiness
in
the
sense
in
which
this
latter
term
signifies
some
degree
of
painfulness
the
mistake
is
connected
with
the
equally
erroneous
view
which
hobbes
controverts
in
his
usual
forcible
style
that
the
felicity
of
this
life
consisteth
in
the
repose
of
a
mind
satisfied
and
it
has
also
some
affinity
with
the
widespread
view
which
has
left
its
mark
on
more
than
one
european
language
that
labour
strenuous
activity
is
essentially
painful
on
both
these
points
it
ought
to
be
said
there
is
doubtless
considerable
divergence
between
the
experiences
of
different
individuals
but
at
any
rate
among
englishmen
i
conceive
that
a
person
who
finds
desire
always
painful
in
the
sense
in
which
as
i
have
tried
to
show
the
word
is
commonly
used
both
by
moralists
and
in
ordinary
discourse
is
as
exceptional
a
being
as
one
who
finds
labour
always
painful
footnotes
the
relation
of
the
æsthetic
to
the
moral
ideal
of
conduct
will
be
discussed
in
a
subsequent
chapter
ix
of
this
book
i
here
as
in
chap
adopt
the
exact
hedonistic
interpretation
of
happiness
which
bentham
has
made
current
this
seems
to
me
the
most
suitable
use
of
the
term
but
i
afterwards

vii
take
note
of
other
uses
introduction
chap
ii
leslie
stephen
who
holds
of
that
pain
and
pleasure
are
the
sole
determining
causes
of
action
at
the
same
time
thinks
that
it
will
be
admitted
on
all
hands
that
we
are
not
always
determined
by
a
calculation
of
pleasure
to
or
more
precisely
greatest
surplus
of
pleasure
over
the
qualifications
and
limitations
which
this
proposition
requires
before
it
can
be
accepted
as
strictly
true
do
not
seem
to
me
important
for
the
purpose
of
the
present
argument
see
book
ii
chap
ii
in
the
present
treatise
desire
is
primarily
regarded
as
a
felt
impulse
or
stimulus
to
actions
tending
to
the
realisation
of
what
is
desired
there
are
however
states
of
feeling
sometimes
intense
to
which
the
term
desire
is
by
usage
applicable
in
which
this
impulsive
quality
seems
to
be
absent
or
at
least
latent
because
the
realisation
of
the
desired
result
is
recognised
as
hopeless
and
has
long
been
so
recognised
in
such
cases
the
desire
remains
in
consciousness
only
as
a
sense
of
want
of
a
recognised
good
a
feeling
no
more
or
otherwise
impulsive
than
the
regretful
memory
of
past
joy
that
is
desire
in
this
condition
may
develop
a
secondary
impulse
to
voluntary
by
which
a
imaginary
satisfaction
of
the
want
is
attained
or
so
far
as
it
is
painful
it
may
impel
to
action
or
thought
which
will
bring
about
its
own
extinction
but
its
primary
impulse
to
acts
tending
to
realise
the
desired
result
is
no
longer
perceptible
with
this
state
of
mind
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
of
the
night
for
the
morrow
i
am
not
concerned
in
the
present
discussion
i
notice
it
chiefly
because
some
writers
bain
seem
to
contemplate
as
the
sole
or
typical
case
of
desire
where
there
is
a
motive
and
no
ability
to
act
upon
it
thus
expressly
excluding
that
condition
of
desire
as
i
use
the
term
which
seems
to
me
of
primary
importance
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
where
action
tending
to
bring
about
the
desired
result
is
conceived
as
at
once
possible
the
confusion
occurs
in
the
most
singular
form
in
hobbes
who
actually
identifies
pleasure
and
appetite
this
motion
in
which
consisteth
pleasure
is
a
solicitation
to
draw
near
to
the
thing
that
the
same
argument
is
put
in
a
more
guarded
and
i
think
unexceptionable
form
by
hutcheson
it
is
perhaps
more
remarkable
that
hume
too
shares
butler
s
view
which
he
expresses
almost
in
the
language
of
the
famous
sermons
there
are
he
says
bodily
wants
or
appetites
acknowledged
by
every
one
which
necessarily
precede
all
sensual
enjoyment
and
carry
us
directly
to
seek
possession
of
the
object
thus
hunger
and
thirst
have
eating
and
drinking
for
their
end
and
from
the
gratification
of
these
primary
appetites
arises
a
pleasure
which
may
become
the
object
of
another
species
of
inclination
that
is
secondary
and
hence
hume
finds
that
the
hypothesis
which
allows
of
a
disinterested
benevolence
distinct
from
is
conformable
to
the
analogy
of
see
concerning
the
principles

some
further
discussion
of
it
will
be
found
in
the
note
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
professor
mackenzie
in
his
of
edition
book
chap
ii
note
arguing
for
the
universal
painfulness
of
desire
urges
that
the
pleasures
of
pursuit
are
really
pleasures
of
progressive
attainment
what
causes
pleasure
being
the
series
of
partial
attainments
that
precede
the
final
attainment
there
seems
to
me
much
truth
in
this
view
as
regards
some
forms
of
pursuit
but
in
other
cases
i
can
find
nothing
deserving
the
name
in
the
course
of
the
pursuit
the
prominent
element
of
the
pleasure
seems
to
be
clearly
the
reflex
of
eager
and
hopeful
perhaps
consciously
skilful
activity
this
is
often
the
case
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
scientific
or
historical
i
have
spent
most
pleasant
hours
in
hunting
for
evidence
in
favour
of
a
conjecture
that
had
occurred
to
me
as
a
possible
solution
of
a
difficult
historical
question
without
any
progressive
attainment
at
all
as
i
found
no
evidence
of
any
importance
but
the
pleasure
had
none
the
less
been
real
at
any
rate
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
pursuit
or
take
the
common
experience
of
or
the
struggle
for
victory
in
an
evenly
balanced
game
of
chess
or
a
prolonged
race
in
which
no
competitor
gains
on
the
others
till
near
the
end
i
find
nothing
like
progressive
attainment
in
these
cases
but
even
granting
mackenzie
s
view
to
be
more
widely
applicable
than
i
think
it
the
question
it
deals
with
seems
to
me
in
the
main
irrelevant
to
the
issue
that
i
am
now
discussing
since
it
remains
true
that
the
presence
of
antecedent
desire
is
an
essential
condition
of
the
pleasures
of
attainment
whether
progressive
or
catastrophic
and
that
the
desire
is
not
itself
perceptibly
painful
lecky
of
european
introduction
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
distinguish
carefully
the
question
discussed
in
this
chapter
which
relates
to
the
of
desires
and
aversions
from
the
different
question
whether
the
of
these
impulses
are
always
to
be
found
in
antecedent
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
the
bearing
of
this
latter
question
on
ethics
though
not
unimportant
is
manifestly
more
indirect
than
that
of
the
question
here
dealt
with
and
it
will
be
convenient
to
postpone
it
till
a
later
stage
of
the
discussion
cf
book
ii
chap
vi
and
book
iv
chap
iv
chapter
v
free
will
in
the
preceding
chapters
i
have
treated
first
of
rational
and
secondly
of
disinterested
action
without
introducing
the
vexed
question
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
the
difficulties
connected
with
this
question
have
been
proved
by
long
dialectical
experience
to
be
so
great
that
i
am
anxious
to
confine
them
within
as
strict
limits
as
i
can
and
keep
as
much
of
my
subject
as
possible
free
from
their
perturbing
influence
and
it
appears
to
me
that
we
have
no
psychological
warrant
for
identifying
disinterested
with
either
free
or
rational
action
while
to
identify
rational
and
free
action
is
at
least
misleading
and
tends
to
obscure
the
real
issue
raised
in
the
free
will
controversy
in
the
last
chapter
i
have
tried
to
show
that
action
strictly
disinterested
that
is
disregardful
of
foreseen
balance
of
pleasure
to
ourselves
is
found
in
the
most
instinctive
as
well
as
in
the
most
deliberate
and
region
of
our
volitional
experience
and
rational
action
as
i
conceive
it
remains
rational
however
completely
the
rationality
of
any
individual
s
conduct
may
be
determined
by
causes
antecedent
or
external
to
his
own
volition
so
that
the
conception
of
acting
rationally
as
explained
in
the
last
chapter
but
one
is
not
bound
up
with
the
notion
of
acting
freely
as
maintained
by
libertarians
generally
against
determinists
i
say
libertarians
generally
because
in
the
statements
made
by
disciples
of
kant
as
to
the
connexion
of
freedom
and
rationality
there
appears
to
me
to
be
a
confusion
between
two
meanings
of
the
term
freedom
which
require
to
be
carefully
distinguished
in
any
discussion
of
free
will
when
a
disciple
of
kant
says
that
a
man
is
a
free
agent
in
so
far
as
he
acts
under
the
guidance
of
reason
the
statement
easily
wins
assent
from
ordinary
readers
since
as
whewell
says
we
ordinarily
consider
our
reason
as
being
ourselves
rather
than
our
desires
and
affections
we
speak
of
desire
love
anger
as
mastering
or
of
as
controlling
them
if
we
decide
to
prefer
some
remote
and
abstract
good
to
immediate
pleasures
or
to
conform
to
a
rule
which
brings
us
present
pain
which
decision
implies
exercise
of
reason
we
more
particularly
consider
such
acts
as
our
i
do
not
therefore
object
on
the
score
of
usage
to
this
application
of
the
term
free
to
denote
voluntary
actions
in
which
the
seductive
solicitations
of
appetite
or
passion
are
successfully
resisted
and
i
am
sensible
of
the
gain
in
effectiveness
of
moral
persuasion
which
is
obtained
by
thus
enlisting
the
powerful
sentiment
of
liberty
on
the
side
of
reason
and
morality
but
it
is
clear
that
if
we
say
that
a
man
is
a
free
agent
in
so
far
as
he
acts
rationally
we
can
not
also
say
in
the
same
sense
that
it
is
by
his
own
free
choice
that
he
acts
irrationally
when
he
does
so
act
and
it
is
this
latter
proposition
which
libertarians
generally
have
been
concerned
to
maintain
they
have
thought
it
of
fundamental
importance
to
show
the
freedom
of
the
moral
agent
on
account
of
the
connexion
that
they
have
held
to
exist
between
freedom
and
moral
responsibility
and
it
is
obvious
that
the
freedom
thus
connected
with
responsibility
is
not
the
freedom
that
is
only
manifested
or
realised
in
rational
action
but
the
freedom
to
choose
between
right
and
wrong
which
is
manifested
or
realised
equally
in
either
choice
now
it
is
implied
in
the
christian
consciousness
of
wilful
sin
that
men
do
deliberately
and
knowingly
choose
to
act
irrationally
they
do
not
merely
prefer
to
duty
for
here
is
rather
a
conflict
of
claims
to
rationality
than
clear
irrationality
but
sensual
indulgence
to
health
revenge
to
reputation
though
they
know
that
such
preference
is
opposed
to
their
true
interests
no
less
than
to
their
duty
hence
it
does
not
really
correspond
to
our
experience
as
a
whole
to
represent
the
conflict
between
reason
and
passion
as
a
conflict
between
ourselves
on
the
one
hand
and
a
force
of
nature
on
the
other
we
may
say
if
we
like
that
when
we
yield
to
passion
we
become
the
slaves
of
our
desires
and
appetites
but
we
must
at
the
same
time
admit
that
our
slavery
is
can
we
say
then
of
the
wilful
wrongdoer
that
his
wrong
choice
was
free
in
the
sense
that
he
might
have
chosen
rightly
not
merely
if
the
antecedents
of
his
volition
external
and
internal
had
been
different
but
supposing
these
antecedents
unchanged
this
i
conceive
is
the
substantial
issue
raised
in
the
free
will
controversy
which
i
now
propose
briefly
to
consider
since
it
is
widely
believed
to
be
of
great
ethical
importance
we
may
conveniently
begin
by
defining
more
exactly
the
notion
of
voluntary
action
to
which
according
to
all
methods
of
ethics
alike
the
predicates
right
and
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
strictest
ethical
sense
are
exclusively
applicable
in
the
first
place
voluntary
action
is
distinguished
as
conscious
from
actions
or
movements
of
the
human
organism
which
are
unconscious
or
the
person
whose
organism
performs
such
movements
only
becomes
aware
of
them
if
at
all
after
they
have
been
performed
accordingly
they
are
not
imputed
to
him
as
a
person
or
judged
to
be
morally
wrong
or
imprudent
though
they
may
sometimes
be
judged
to
be
good
or
bad
in
respect
of
their
consequences
with
the
implication
that
they
ought
to
be
encouraged
or
checked
as
far
as
this
can
be
done
indirectly
by
conscious
effort
so
again
in
the
case
of
conscious
actions
the
agent
is
not
regarded
as
morally
culpable
except
in
an
indirect
way
for
entirely
unforeseen
effects
of
his
voluntary
actions
no
doubt
when
a
man
s
action
has
caused
some
unforeseen
harm
the
popular
moral
judgment
often
blames
him
for
carelessness
but
it
would
be
generally
admitted
by
reflective
persons
that
in
such
cases
strictly
moral
blame
only
attaches
to
the
agent
in
an
indirect
way
in
so
far
as
his
carelessness
is
the
result
of
some
wilful
neglect
of
duty
thus
the
proper
immediate
objects
of
moral
approval
or
disapproval
would
seem
to
be
always
the
results
of
a
man
s
volitions
so
far
as
they
were
intended
represented
in
thought
as
certain
or
probable
consequences
of
his
volitions
or
more
strictly
the
volitions
themselves
in
which
such
results
were
so
intended
since
we
do
not
consider
that
a
man
is
relieved
from
moral
blame
because
his
wrong
intention
remains
unrealised
through
external
causes
this
view
seems
at
first
sight
to
differ
from
the
common
opinion
that
the
morality
of
acts
depends
on
their
motives
if
by
motives
are
understood
the
desires
that
we
feel
for
some
of
the
foreseen
consequences
of
our
acts
but
i
do
not
think
that
those
who
hold
this
opinion
would
deny
that
we
are
blameworthy
for
any
prohibited
result
which
we
foresaw
in
willing
whether
it
was
the
object
of
desire
or
not
no
doubt
it
is
commonly
held
that
acts
similar
as
regards
their
foreseen
results
may
be
better
or
worse
through
the
presence
of
certain
desires
or
aversions
still
so
far
as
these
feelings
are
not
altogether
under
the
control
of
the
will
the
judgment
of
right
and
wrong
in
the
strictest
sense
of
these
terms
seems
to
be
not
properly
applicable
to
the
feelings
themselves
but
rather
to
the
exertion
or
omission
of
voluntary
effort
to
check
bad
motives
and
encourage
good
ones
or
to
the
conscious
adoption
of
an
object
of
desire
as
an
end
to
be
aimed
at
which
is
a
species
of
volition
we
may
conclude
then
that
judgments
of
right
and
wrong
relate
properly
to
volitions
accompanied
with
intention
whether
the
intended
consequences
be
external
or
some
effects
produced
on
the
agent
s
own
feelings
or
character
this
excludes
from
the
scope
of
such
judgments
those
conscious
actions
which
are
not
intentional
strictly
speaking
as
when
sudden
strong
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
cause
movements
which
we
are
aware
of
making
but
which
are
not
preceded
by
any
representation
in
idea
either
of
the
movements
themselves
or
of
their
effects
for
such
actions
sometimes
distinguished
as
instinctive
we
are
only
held
to
be
responsible
indirectly
so
far
as
any
bad
consequences
of
them
might
have
been
prevented
by
voluntary
efforts
to
form
habits
of
more
complete
we
have
to
observe
further
that
our
common
moral
judgments
recognise
an
important
distinction
between
and
wrongdoing
condemning
the
latter
more
strongly
than
the
former
the
line
between
the
two
can
not
be
sharply
drawn
but
we
may
define
impulsive
actions
as
those
where
the
connexion
between
the
feeling
that
prompts
and
the
action
prompted
is
so
simple
and
immediate
that
though
intention
is
distinctly
present
the
consciousness
of
personal
choice
of
the
intended
result
is
evanescent
in
deliberate
volitions
there
is
always
a
conscious
selection
of
the
result
as
one
of
two
or
more
practical
alternatives
in
the
case
then
of
such
volitions
as
are
the
objects
of
moral
condemnation
and
approbation
the
psychical
fact
volition
seems
to
include
besides
intention
or
representation
of
the
results
of
action
also
the
consciousness
of
self
as
choosing
resolving
determining
these
results
and
the
question
which
i
understand
to
be
at
issue
in
the
free
will
controversy
may
be
stated
thus
is
the
self
to
which
i
refer
my
deliberate
volitions
a
self
of
strictly
determinate
moral
qualities
a
definite
character
partly
inherited
partly
formed
by
my
past
actions
and
feelings
and
by
any
physical
influences
that
it
may
have
unconsciously
received
so
that
my
voluntary
action
for
good
or
for
evil
is
at
any
moment
completely
caused
by
the
determinate
qualities
of
this
character
together
with
my
circumstances
or
the
external
influences
acting
on
me
at
the
moment
including
under
this
latter
term
my
present
bodily
conditions
or
is
there
always
a
possibility
of
my
choosing
to
act
in
the
manner
that
i
now
judge
to
be
reasonable
and
right
whatever
my
previous
actions
and
experiences
may
have
been
in
the
above
questions
a
materialist
would
substitute
brain
and
nervous
system
for
character
and
thereby
obtain
a
clearer
notion
but
i
have
avoided
using
terms
which
suggest
materialistic
assumptions
because
determinism
by
no
means
involves
materialism
for
the
present
purpose
the
difference
is
unimportant
the
substantial
dispute
relates
to
the
completeness
of
the
causal
dependence
of
any
volition
upon
the
state
of
things
at
the
preceding
instant
whether
we
specify
these
as
character
and
circumstances
or
brain
and
environing
on
the
determinist
side
there
is
a
cumulative
argument
of
great
force
the
belief
that
events
are
determinately
related
to
the
state
of
things
immediately
preceding
them
is
now
held
by
all
competent
thinkers
in
respect
of
all
kinds
of
occurrences
except
human
volitions
it
has
steadily
grown
both
intensively
and
extensively
both
in
clearness
and
certainty
of
conviction
and
in
universality
of
application
as
the
human
mind
has
developed
and
human
experience
has
been
systematised
and
enlarged
step
by
step
in
successive
departments
of
fact
conflicting
modes
of
thought
have
receded
and
faded
until
at
length
they
have
vanished
everywhere
except
from
this
mysterious
citadel
of
will
everywhere
else
the
belief
is
so
firmly
established
that
some
declare
its
opposite
to
be
inconceivable
others
even
maintain
that
it
always
was
so
every
scientific
procedure
assumes
it
each
success
of
science
confirms
it
and
not
only
are
we
finding
ever
new
proof
that
events
are
cognisably
determined
but
also
that
the
different
modes
of
determination
of
different
kinds
of
events
are
fundamentally
identical
and
mutually
dependent
and
naturally
with
the
increasing
conviction
of
the
essential
unity
of
the
cognisable
universe
increases
the
indisposition
to
allow
the
exceptional
character
claimed
by
libertarians
for
the
department
of
human
action
again
when
we
fix
our
attention
on
human
action
we
observe
that
the
portion
of
it
which
is
originated
unconsciously
is
admittedly
determined
by
physical
causes
and
we
find
that
no
clear
line
can
be
drawn
between
acts
of
this
kind
and
those
which
are
conscious
and
voluntary
not
only
are
many
acts
of
the
former
class
entirely
similar
to
those
of
the
latter
except
in
being
unconscious
but
we
remark
further
that
actions
which
we
habitually
perform
continually
pass
from
the
conscious
class
into
the
wholly
or
partly
unconscious
and
the
further
we
investigate
the
more
the
conclusion
is
forced
upon
us
that
there
is
no
kind
of
action
originated
by
conscious
volition
which
can
not
also
under
certain
circumstances
be
originated
unconsciously
again
when
we
look
closely
at
our
conscious
acts
we
find
that
in
respect
of
such
of
them
as
i
have
characterised
as
impulsive
acts
done
suddenly
under
the
stimulus
of
a
momentary
sensation
or
emotion
our
consciousness
can
hardly
be
said
to
suggest
that
they
are
not
completely
determined
by
the
strength
of
the
stimulus
and
the
state
of
our
previously
determined
temperament
and
character
at
the
time
of
its
operation
and
here
again
as
was
before
observed
it
is
difficult
to
draw
a
line
clearly
separating
these
actions
from
those
in
which
the
apparent
consciousness
of
free
choice
becomes
distinct
further
we
always
explain
the
voluntary
action
of
all
men
except
ourselves
on
the
principle
of
causation
by
character
and
circumstances
indeed
otherwise
social
life
would
be
impossible
for
the
life
of
man
in
society
involves
daily
a
mass
of
minute
forecasts
of
the
actions
of
other
men
founded
on
experience
of
mankind
generally
or
of
particular
classes
of
men
or
of
individuals
who
are
thus
necessarily
regarded
as
things
having
determinate
properties
causes
whose
effects
are
calculable
we
infer
generally
the
future
actions
of
those
whom
we
know
from
their
past
actions
and
if
our
forecast
turns
out
in
any
case
to
be
erroneous
we
do
not
attribute
the
discrepancy
to
the
disturbing
influence
of
free
will
but
to
our
incomplete
acquaintance
with
their
character
and
motives
and
passing
from
individuals
to
communities
whether
we
believe
in
a
social
science
or
not
we
all
admit
and
take
part
in
discussions
of
social
phenomena
in
which
the
same
principle
is
assumed
and
however
we
may
differ
as
to
particular
theories
we
never
doubt
the
validity
of
the
assumption
and
if
we
find
anything
inexplicable
in
history
past
or
present
it
never
occurs
to
us
to
attribute
it
to
an
extensive
exercise
of
free
will
in
a
particular
direction
nay
even
as
regards
our
own
actions
however
free
we
feel
ourselves
at
any
moment
however
unconstrained
by
present
motives
and
circumstances
and
unfettered
by
the
result
of
what
we
have
previously
been
and
felt
our
volitional
choice
may
appear
still
when
it
is
once
well
past
and
we
survey
it
in
the
series
of
our
actions
its
relations
of
causation
and
resemblance
to
other
parts
of
our
life
appear
and
we
naturally
explain
it
as
an
effect
of
our
nature
education
and
circumstances
nay
we
even
apply
the
same
conceptions
to
our
future
action
and
the
more
in
proportion
as
our
moral
sentiments
are
developed
for
with
our
sense
of
duty
generally
increases
our
sense
of
the
duty
of
moral
culture
and
our
desire
of
and
the
possibility
of
moral
depends
on
the
assumption
that
by
a
present
volition
we
can
determine
to
some
extent
our
actions
in
the
more
or
less
remote
future
no
doubt
we
habitually
take
at
the
same
time
the
opposite
libertarian
view
as
to
our
future
we
believe
for
example
that
we
are
perfectly
able
to
resist
henceforward
temptations
to
which
we
have
continually
yielded
in
the
past
but
it
should
be
observed
that
this
belief
is
as
moralists
of
all
schools
admit
and
even
urge
any
rate
to
a
great
illusory
and
misleading
though
libertarians
contend
that
it
is
for
us
at
any
moment
to
act
in
a
manner
opposed
to
our
acquired
tendencies
and
previous
customs
still
they
and
determinists
alike
teach
that
it
is
much
less
easy
than
men
commonly
imagine
to
break
the
subtle
unfelt
trammels
of
habit
against
the
formidable
array
of
cumulative
evidence
offered
for
determinism
there
is
to
be
set
the
immediate
affirmation
of
consciousness
in
the
moment
of
deliberate
action
certainly
when
i
have
a
distinct
consciousness
of
choosing
between
alternatives
of
conduct
one
of
which
i
conceive
as
right
or
reasonable
i
find
it
impossible
not
to
think
that
i
can
now
choose
to
do
what
i
so
conceive
supposing
that
there
is
no
obstacle
to
my
doing
it
other
than
the
condition
of
my
desires
and
voluntary
habits
however
strong
may
be
my
inclination
to
act
unreasonably
and
however
uniformly
i
may
have
yielded
to
such
inclinations
in
the
past
i
recognise
that
each
concession
to
vicious
desire
makes
the
difficulty
of
resisting
it
greater
when
the
desire
recurs
but
the
difficulty
always
seems
to
remain
separated
from
impossibility
by
an
impassable
gulf
i
do
not
deny
that
the
experience
of
mankind
includes
cases
in
which
certain
impulses
such
as
aversion
to
death
or
extreme
pain
or
morbid
appetite
for
alcohol
or
opium
have
reached
a
point
of
intensity
at
which
they
have
been
felt
as
irresistibly
overmastering
voluntary
choice
i
think
we
commonly
judge
that
when
this
point
is
reached
the
individual
ceases
to
be
morally
responsible
for
the
act
done
under
such
overmastering
impulse
but
at
any
rate
the
moral
problem
thus
presented
is
very
exceptional
in
ordinary
cases
of
yielding
to
temptation
this
consciousness
of
the
irresistibility
of
impulse
does
not
come
in
ordinarily
however
strong
may
be
the
rush
of
appetite
or
anger
that
comes
over
me
it
does
not
present
itself
as
irresistible
and
if
i
deliberate
at
such
a
moment
i
can
not
regard
the
mere
force
of
the
impulse
as
a
reason
for
doing
what
i
otherwise
judge
to
be
unreasonable
i
can
suppose
that
my
conviction
of
free
choice
be
illusory
that
if
i
knew
my
own
nature
i
see
it
to
be
predetermined
that
being
so
constituted
and
in
such
circumstances
i
should
act
on
the
occasion
in
question
contrary
to
my
rational
judgment
but
i
can
not
conceive
myself
seeing
this
without
at
the
same
time
conceiving
my
whole
conception
of
what
i
now
call
my
action
fundamentally
altered
i
can
not
conceive
that
if
i
contemplated
the
actions
of
my
organism
in
this
light
i
should
refer
them
to
my
self
to
the
mind
so
contemplating
in
the
sense
in
which
i
now
refer
them
in
this
conflict
of
arguments
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
theoretical
question
as
to
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
still
differently
decided
by
thinkers
of
repute
and
i
do
not
myself
wish
at
present
to
pronounce
any
decision
on
it
but
i
think
it
possible
and
useful
to
show
that
the
ethical
importance
of
deciding
it
one
way
or
another
is
liable
to
be
exaggerated
and
that
any
one
who
will
consider
the
matter
soberly
and
carefully
will
find
this
importance
to
be
of
a
strictly
limited
kind
it
is
chiefly
on
the
libertarian
side
that
i
find
a
tendency
to
the
exaggeration
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
some
libertarian
writers
maintain
that
the
conception
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
alien
as
it
may
be
to
positive
science
is
yet
quite
indispensable
to
ethics
and
jurisprudence
since
in
judging
that
i
ought
to
do
anything
i
imply
that
i
can
do
it
and
similarly
in
praising
or
blaming
the
actions
of
others
i
imply
that
they
could
have
acted
otherwise
if
a
man
s
actions
are
mere
links
in
a
chain
of
causation
which
as
we
trace
it
back
ultimately
carries
us
to
events
anterior
to
his
personal
existence
he
can
not
it
is
said
really
have
either
merit
or
demerit
and
if
he
has
not
merit
or
demerit
it
is
repugnant
to
the
common
moral
sense
of
mankind
to
reward
or
punish
even
to
praise
or
blame
him
in
considering
this
argument
it
will
be
convenient
for
clearness
of
discussion
to
assume
in
the
first
instance
that
there
is
no
doubt
or
conflict
in
our
view
of
what
it
is
right
to
do
except
such
as
may
be
caused
by
the
present
question
it
will
also
be
convenient
to
separate
the
discussion
of
the
importance
of
free
will
in
relation
to
moral
action
generally
from
the
special
question
of
its
importance
in
relation
to
punishing
and
rewarding
since
in
the
latter
species
of
action
what
chiefly
claims
attention
is
not
the
present
freedom
of
the
agent
but
the
past
freedom
of
the
person
now
acted
on
as
regards
action
generally
the
determinist
allows
that
a
man
is
only
morally
bound
to
do
what
is
in
his
power
but
he
explains
in
his
power
to
mean
that
the
result
in
question
will
be
produced
if
the
man
choose
to
produce
it
and
this
is
i
think
the
sense
in
which
the
proposition
what
i
ought
to
do
i
can
do
is
commonly
accepted
it
means
can
do
if
i
choose
not
can
choose
to
still
the
question
remains
i
choose
to
do
what
in
ordinary
thought
i
judge
to
be
right
to
do
here
my
own
view
is
that
within
the
limits
above
explained
i
inevitably
conceive
that
i
choose
however
i
can
suppose
myself
to
regard
this
conception
as
illusory
and
to
judge
inferring
the
future
from
the
past
that
i
certainly
shall
not
choose
and
accordingly
that
such
choice
is
not
really
possible
to
me
this
being
supposed
it
seems
to
me
undeniable
that
this
judgment
will
exclude
or
weaken
the
operation
of
the
moral
motive
in
the
case
of
the
act
contemplated
i
either
shall
not
judge
it
reasonable
to
choose
to
do
what
i
should
otherwise
so
judge
or
if
i
do
pass
the
judgment
i
shall
also
judge
the
conception
of
duty
applied
in
it
to
be
illusory
no
less
than
the
conception
of
freedom
so
far
i
concede
the
libertarian
contention
as
to
the
demoralising
effect
of
determinism
if
held
with
a
real
force
of
conviction
but
i
think
the
cases
are
rare
in
which
it
is
even
on
determinist
principles
legitimate
to
conclude
it
to
be
certain
and
not
merely
highly
probable
that
i
shall
deliberately
choose
to
do
what
i
judge
to
be
unwise
ordinarily
the
legitimate
inference
from
a
man
s
past
experience
and
from
his
general
knowledge
of
human
nature
would
not
go
beyond
a
very
strong
probability
that
he
would
choose
to
do
wrong
and
a
mere
probability
however
strong
that
i
shall
not
will
to
do
right
can
not
be
regarded
by
me
in
deliberation
as
a
reason
for
not
willing
while
it
certainly
supplies
a
rational
ground
for
willing
strongly
just
as
a
strong
probability
of
any
other
evil
supplies
a
rational
ground
for
special
exertions
to
avoid
it
indeed
i
do
not
see
why
a
libertarian
should
not
equally
with
a
determinist
accept
as
valid
and
find
it
instructive
to
contemplate
the
considerations
that
render
it
probable
that
he
will
choose
to
do
right
in
any
particular
circumstances
in
all
ordinary
cases
therefore
it
does
not
seem
to
me
relevant
to
ethical
deliberation
to
determine
the
metaphysical
validity
of
my
consciousness
of
freedom
to
choose
whatever
i
may
conclude
to
be
reasonable
unless
the
affirmation
or
negation
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
somehow
modifies
my
view
of
what
it
would
be
reasonable
to
choose
to
do
if
i
could
so
choose
i
do
not
think
that
any
such
modification
of
view
can
be
maintained
as
regards
the
ultimate
ends
of
rational
action
which
in
chap
i
took
as
being
commonly
accepted
if
happiness
whether
private
or
general
be
taken
as
the
ultimate
end
of
action
on
a
libertarian
view
the
adoption
of
a
determinist
view
affords
no
ground
for
rejecting
it
and
if
excellence
is
in
itself
admirable
and
desirable
it
surely
remains
equally
so
whether
any
individual
s
approximation
to
it
is
entirely
determined
by
inherited
nature
and
external
influences
or
not
except
so
far
as
the
notion
of
excellence
includes
that
of
free
will
now
free
will
is
obviously
not
included
in
our
common
ideal
of
physical
and
intellectual
perfection
and
it
seems
to
me
also
not
to
be
included
in
the
common
notions
of
the
excellences
of
character
which
we
call
virtues
the
manifestations
of
courage
temperance
and
justice
do
not
become
less
admirable
because
we
can
trace
their
antecedents
in
a
happy
balance
of
inherited
dispositions
developed
by
a
careful
education
can
then
the
affirmation
or
negation
of
free
will
affect
our
view
of
the
fittest
means
for
the
attainment
of
either
end
in
considering
this
we
have
to
distinguish
between
the
case
of
a
connexion
between
means
and
end
believed
to
exist
on
empirical
or
other
scientific
grounds
and
the
case
where
the
belief
in
such
connexion
is
an
inference
from
the
belief
in
a
moral
government
of
the
world
according
to
the
received
view
of
the
moral
government
of
the
world
the
performance
of
duty
is
the
best
means
of
attaining
the
agent
s
happiness
largely
through
its
expected
consequences
in
another
world
in
which
virtue
will
be
rewarded
and
vice
punished
by
god
if
then
the
belief
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
and
a
future
life
for
men
is
held
to
depend
on
the
assumption
of
free
will
this
latter
becomes
obviously
of
fundamental
ethical
importance
not
indeed
in
determining
a
man
s
duty
but
in
reconciling
it
with
his
interest
this
i
think
is
the
main
element
of
truth
in
the
view
that
the
denial
of
free
will
removes
motives
to
the
performance
of
duty
and
i
admit
the
validity
of
the
contention
so
far
as
the
course
of
action
conducive
to
an
individual
s
interest
would
be
thought
to
diverge
from
his
duty
apart
from
theological
considerations
and
in
the
theological
reasoning
that
removes
this
divergence
free
will
is
an
indispensable
assumption
the
former
point
will
be
examined
in
a
subsequent
chapter
the
latter
it
hardly
falls
within
the
scope
of
this
treatise
to
discuss
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
such
connexion
between
means
and
ends
as
is
scientifically
cognisable
it
does
not
appear
that
an
act
now
deliberated
on
can
be
less
or
more
a
means
to
any
ulterior
end
because
it
is
predetermined
it
may
however
be
urged
that
in
considering
how
we
ought
to
act
in
any
case
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
probable
future
actions
of
others
and
also
of
ourselves
and
that
with
regard
to
these
it
is
necessary
to
decide
the
question
of
free
will
in
order
that
we
may
know
whether
the
future
is
capable
of
being
predicted
from
the
past
but
here
again
it
seems
to
me
that
no
definite
practical
consequences
would
logically
follow
from
this
decision
for
however
far
we
may
go
in
admitting
free
will
as
a
cause
the
actual
operation
of
which
may
falsify
the
most
scientific
forecasts
of
human
action
still
since
it
is
an
absolutely
unknown
cause
our
recognition
of
it
can
not
lead
us
to
modify
any
such
forecasts
at
most
it
can
only
affect
our
reliance
on
them
we
may
illustrate
this
by
an
imaginary
extreme
case
suppose
we
were
somehow
convinced
that
all
the
planets
were
endowed
with
free
will
and
that
they
only
maintained
their
periodic
motions
by
the
continual
exercise
of
free
choice
in
resistance
to
strong
centrifugal
or
centripetal
inclinations
our
general
confidence
in
the
future
of
the
solar
system
might
reasonably
be
impaired
though
it
is
not
easy
to
say
how
much
but
the
details
of
our
astronomical
calculations
would
be
clearly
unaffected
the
free
wills
could
in
no
way
be
taken
as
an
element
in
the
reckoning
and
the
case
would
be
similar
i
suppose
in
the
forecast
of
human
conduct
if
psychology
and
sociology
should
ever
become
exact
sciences
at
present
however
they
are
so
far
from
being
such
that
this
additional
element
of
uncertainty
can
hardly
have
even
any
emotional
effect
to
sum
up
we
may
say
that
in
so
far
as
we
reason
to
any
definite
conclusions
as
to
what
the
future
actions
of
ourselves
or
others
will
be
we
must
consider
them
as
determined
by
unvarying
laws
if
they
are
not
completely
so
determined
our
reasoning
is
liable
to
error
but
no
other
is
open
to
us
while
on
the
other
hand
when
we
are
endeavouring
to
ascertain
on
any
principles
what
choice
it
is
reasonable
to
make
between
two
alternatives
of
present
conduct
determinist
conceptions
are
as
irrelevant
as
they
are
in
the
former
case
inevitable
and
from
neither
point
of
view
does
it
seem
practically
important
for
the
general
regulation
of
conduct
to
decide
the
metaphysical
question
at
issue
in
the
controversy
unless
passing
from
ethics
into
theology
we
rest
the
reconciliation
of
duty
and
interest
on
a
theological
argument
that
requires
the
assumption
of
free
will
so
far
i
have
been
arguing
that
the
adoption
of
determinism
will
not
except
in
certain
exceptional
circumstances
or
on
certain
theological
assumptions
reasonably
modify
a
man
s
view
of
what
it
is
right
for
him
to
do
or
his
reasons
for
doing
it
it
may
however
be
said
that
granting
the
reasons
for
right
action
to
remain
unaltered
still
the
motives
that
prompt
to
it
will
be
weakened
since
a
man
will
not
feel
for
his
actions
if
he
regards
them
as
necessary
results
of
causes
anterior
to
his
personal
existence
i
admit
that
so
far
as
the
sentiment
of
remorse
implies
irremovably
fixed
on
the
self
blamed
it
must
tend
to
vanish
from
the
mind
of
a
convinced
determinist
still
i
do
not
see
why
the
imagination
of
a
determinist
should
not
be
as
vivid
his
sympathy
as
keen
his
love
of
goodness
as
strong
as
a
libertarian
s
and
i
therefore
see
no
reason
why
dislike
for
his
own
shortcomings
and
for
the
mischievous
qualities
of
his
character
which
have
caused
bad
actions
in
the
past
should
not
be
as
effective
a
spring
of
moral
improvement
as
the
sentiment
of
remorse
would
be
for
it
appears
to
me
that
men
in
general
take
at
least
as
much
pains
to
cure
defects
in
their
circumstances
organic
defects
and
defects
of
intellect
which
cause
them
no
remorse
as
they
do
to
cure
moral
defects
so
far
as
they
consider
the
former
to
be
no
less
mischievous
and
no
less
removable
than
the
latter
this
leads
me
to
the
consideration
of
the
effect
of
determinist
doctrines
on
the
allotment
of
punishment
and
reward
for
it
must
be
admitted
i
think
that
the
common
retributive
view
of
punishment
and
the
ordinary
notions
of
merit
demerit
and
responsibility
also
involve
the
assumption
of
free
will
if
the
wrong
act
and
the
bad
qualities
of
character
manifested
in
it
are
conceived
as
the
necessary
effects
of
causes
antecedent
or
external
to
the
existence
of
the
agent
the
moral
responsibility
in
the
ordinary
sense
for
the
mischief
caused
by
them
can
no
longer
rest
on
him
at
the
same
time
the
determinist
can
give
to
the
terms
and
responsibility
a
signification
which
is
not
only
clear
and
definite
but
from
an
utilitarian
point
of
view
the
only
suitable
meaning
in
this
view
if
i
affirm
that
a
is
responsible
for
a
harmful
act
i
mean
that
it
is
right
to
punish
him
for
it
primarily
in
order
that
the
fear
of
punishment
may
prevent
him
and
others
from
committing
similar
acts
in
future
the
difference
between
these
two
views
of
punishment
is
theoretically
very
wide
i
shall
however
when
i
come
to
examine
in
detail
the
current
conception
of
justice
endeavour
to
show
that
this
admission
can
hardly
have
any
practical
effect
since
it
is
practically
impossible
to
be
guided
either
in
remunerating
services
or
in
punishing
mischievous
acts
by
any
other
considerations
than
those
which
the
determinist
interpretation
of
desert
would
include
for
instance
the
treatment
of
legal
punishment
as
deterrent
and
reformatory
rather
than
retributive
seems
to
be
forced
upon
us
by
the
practical
exigences
of
social
order
and
wellbeing
quite
apart
from
any
determinist
philosophy
moreover
as
i
shall
hereafter
show
if
the
retributive
view
of
punishment
be
strictly
taken
abstracting
completely
from
the
preventive
view
it
brings
our
conception
of
justice
into
conflict
with
benevolence
as
punishment
presents
itself
as
a
purely
useless
evil
similarly
as
regards
the
sentiments
which
prompt
to
the
expression
of
moral
praise
and
blame
i
admit
that
in
the
mind
of
a
convinced
determinist
the
desire
to
encourage
good
and
prevent
bad
conduct
must
take
the
place
of
a
desire
to
requite
the
one
or
the
other
but
again
i
see
no
reason
why
the
determinist
species
of
moral
sentiments
should
not
be
as
effective
in
promoting
virtue
and
social
wellbeing
as
the
libertarian
species
it
is
however
of
obvious
practical
importance
to
ascertain
how
far
the
power
of
the
will
whether
metaphysically
free
or
not
actually
extends
for
this
defines
the
range
within
which
ethical
judgments
are
in
the
strictest
sense
applicable
this
inquiry
is
quite
independent
of
the
question
of
metaphysical
freedom
we
might
state
it
in
determinist
terms
as
an
inquiry
into
the
range
of
effects
which
it
would
be
possible
to
cause
by
human
volition
provided
that
adequate
motives
are
not
wanting
these
effects
seem
to
be
mainly
of
three
kinds
first
changes
in
the
external
world
consequent
upon
muscular
contractions
secondly
changes
in
the
train
of
ideas
and
feelings
that
constitutes
our
conscious
life
and
thirdly
changes
in
the
tendencies
to
act
hereafter
in
certain
ways
under
certain
circumstances
i
the
most
obvious
and
prominent
part
of
the
sphere
of
volitional
causation
is
constituted
by
such
events
as
can
be
produced
by
muscular
contractions
as
regards
these
it
is
sometimes
said
that
it
is
properly
the
muscular
contraction
that
we
will
and
not
the
more
remote
effects
for
these
require
the
concurrence
of
other
causes
and
therefore
we
can
never
be
absolutely
certain
that
they
will
follow
but
no
more
is
it
certain
strictly
speaking
that
the
muscular
contraction
will
follow
since
our
limb
may
be
paralysed
etc
the
immediate
consequent
of
the
volition
is
some
molecular
change
in
the
motor
nerves
since
however
we
are
not
conscious
in
willing
of
our
motor
nerves
and
their
changes
nor
indeed
commonly
of
the
muscular
contractions
that
follow
them
it
seems
a
misuse
of
terms
to
describe
either
as
the
normal
object
of
the
mind
in
willing
since
it
is
almost
always
some
more
remote
effect
which
we
consciously
will
and
intend
still
of
almost
all
effects
of
our
will
on
the
external
world
some
contraction
of
our
muscles
is
an
indispensable
antecedent
and
when
that
is
over
our
part
in
the
causation
is
completed
ii
we
can
control
to
some
extent
our
thoughts
and
feelings
it
would
seem
indeed
that
an
important
part
of
what
we
commonly
call
control
of
feeling
comes
under
the
head
just
discussed
our
control
over
our
muscles
enables
us
to
keep
down
the
expression
of
the
feeling
and
to
resist
its
promptings
to
action
and
as
the
giving
free
vent
to
a
feeling
tends
generally
speaking
to
sustain
and
prolong
it
this
muscular
control
amounts
to
a
certain
power
over
the
emotion
but
there
is
not
the
same
connexion
between
our
muscular
system
and
our
thoughts
and
yet
experience
shows
that
most
men
though
some
no
doubt
much
more
than
others
can
voluntarily
determine
the
direction
of
their
thoughts
and
pursue
at
will
a
given
line
of
meditation
in
such
cases
what
is
effected
by
the
effort
of
will
seems
to
be
the
concentration
of
our
consciousness
on
a
part
of
its
content
so
that
this
part
grows
more
vivid
and
clear
while
the
rest
tends
to
become
obscure
and
ultimately
to
vanish
frequently
this
voluntary
exertion
is
only
needed
to
initiate
a
train
of
ideas
which
is
afterwards
continued
without
effort
as
in
recalling
a
series
of
past
events
or
going
through
a
familiar
train
of
reasoning
by
such
concentration
we
can
free
ourselves
of
many
thoughts
and
feelings
upon
which
we
do
not
wish
to
dwell
but
our
power
to
do
this
is
very
limited
and
if
the
feeling
be
strong
and
its
cause
persistent
it
requires
a
very
unusual
effort
of
will
to
banish
it
thus
iii
the
effect
of
volition
however
to
which
i
especially
wish
to
direct
the
reader
s
attention
is
the
alteration
in
men
s
tendencies
to
future
action
which
must
be
assumed
to
be
a
consequence
of
general
resolutions
as
to
future
conduct
so
far
as
they
are
effective
even
a
resolution
to
do
a
particular
act
if
it
is
worth
while
to
make
it
as
experience
shows
it
to
be
must
be
supposed
to
produce
a
change
of
this
kind
in
the
person
who
makes
it
it
must
somehow
modify
his
present
tendencies
to
act
in
a
certain
way
on
a
foreseen
future
occasion
but
it
is
in
making
general
resolutions
for
future
conduct
that
it
is
of
most
practical
importance
for
us
to
know
what
is
within
the
power
of
the
will
let
us
take
an
example
a
man
has
been
in
the
habit
of
drinking
too
much
brandy
nightly
one
morning
he
resolves
that
he
will
do
so
no
more
in
making
this
resolve
he
acts
under
the
belief
that
by
a
present
volition
he
can
so
far
alter
his
habitual
tendency
to
indulgence
in
brandy
that
some
hours
hence
he
will
resist
the
full
force
of
his
habitual
craving
for
the
stimulant
now
whether
this
belief
is
well
or
ill
founded
is
a
different
question
from
that
usually
discussed
between
determinists
and
libertarians
at
the
same
time
the
two
questions
are
liable
to
be
confused
it
is
sometimes
vaguely
thought
that
a
belief
in
free
will
requires
us
to
maintain
that
at
any
moment
we
can
alter
our
habits
to
any
extent
by
a
sufficiently
strong
exertion
and
no
doubt
most
commonly
when
we
make
such
efforts
we
believe
at
the
moment
that
they
will
be
completely
effectual
we
will
to
do
something
hours
or
days
hence
with
the
same
confidence
with
which
we
will
to
do
something
immediately
but
on
reflection
no
one
i
think
will
maintain
that
in
such
cases
the
future
act
appears
to
be
in
his
power
in
the
same
sense
as
a
choice
of
alternatives
that
takes
effect
immediately
not
only
does
continual
experience
show
us
that
such
resolutions
as
to
the
future
have
a
limited
and
too
frequently
an
inadequate
effect
but
the
common
belief
is
really
inconsistent
with
the
very
doctrine
of
free
will
that
is
thought
to
justify
it
for
if
by
a
present
volition
i
can
fully
determine
an
action
that
is
to
take
place
some
hours
hence
when
the
time
comes
to
do
that
act
i
shall
find
myself
no
longer
free
we
must
therefore
accept
the
conclusion
that
each
such
resolve
has
only
a
limited
effect
and
that
we
can
not
know
when
making
it
how
far
this
effect
will
exhibit
itself
in
the
performance
of
the
act
resolved
upon
at
the
same
time
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
such
resolves
sometimes
succeed
in
breaking
old
habits
and
even
when
they
fail
to
do
this
they
often
substitute
a
painful
struggle
for
smooth
and
easy
indulgence
hence
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
always
produce
some
effect
in
this
direction
whether
they
operate
by
causing
new
motives
to
present
themselves
on
the
side
of
reason
when
the
time
of
inner
conflict
arrives
or
whether
they
directly
weaken
the
impulsive
force
of
habit
in
the
same
manner
as
an
actual
breach
of
custom
does
though
in
an
inferior
degree
if
this
account
of
the
range
of
volition
be
accepted
it
will
i
trust
dispel
any
lingering
doubts
which
the
argument
of
the
preceding
section
as
to
the
practical
unimportance
of
the
free
will
controversy
may
have
left
in
the
reader
s
mind
for
it
may
have
been
vaguely
thought
that
while
on
the
determinist
theory
it
would
be
wrong
in
certain
cases
to
perform
a
single
act
of
virtue
if
we
had
no
ground
for
believing
that
we
should
hereafter
duly
follow
it
up
on
the
assumption
of
freedom
we
should
boldly
do
always
what
would
be
best
if
consistently
followed
up
being
conscious
that
such
consistency
is
in
our
power
but
the
supposed
difference
vanishes
if
it
be
admitted
that
by
any
effort
of
resolution
at
the
present
moment
we
can
only
produce
a
certain
limited
effect
upon
our
tendencies
to
action
at
some
future
time
and
that
immediate
consciousness
can
not
tell
us
that
this
effect
will
be
adequate
to
the
occasion
nor
indeed
how
great
it
will
really
prove
to
be
for
the
most
extreme
libertarian
must
then
allow
that
before
pledging
ourselves
to
any
future
course
of
action
we
ought
to
estimate
carefully
from
our
experience
of
ourselves
and
general
knowledge
of
human
nature
what
the
probability
is
of
our
keeping
present
resolutions
in
the
circumstances
in
which
we
are
likely
to
be
placed
it
is
no
doubt
morally
most
important
that
we
should
not
tranquilly
acquiesce
in
any
weakness
or
want
of
but
the
fact
remains
that
such
weakness
is
not
curable
by
a
single
volition
and
whatever
we
can
do
towards
curing
it
by
any
effort
of
will
at
any
moment
is
as
clearly
enjoined
by
reason
on
the
determinist
theory
as
it
is
on
the
libertarian
on
neither
theory
is
it
reasonable
that
we
should
deceive
ourselves
as
to
the
extent
of
our
weakness
or
ignore
it
in
the
forecast
of
our
conduct
or
suppose
it
more
easily
remediable
than
it
really
is
footnotes
i
have
thought
it
expedient
to
exclude
the
kantian
conception
of
free
will
from
the
scope
of
the
discussion
in
this
chapter
partly
on
account
of
the
confusion
mentioned
in
the
text
partly
because
it
depends
on
the
conception
of
a
causality
not
subject
to
which
appears
to
me
altogether
untenable
while
it
does
not
fall
within
the
plan
of
the
present
treatise
to
discuss
it
but
considering
the
widespread
influence
of
kantian
theory
on
current
ethical
thought
i
have
thought
it
desirable
to
give
a
brief
discussion
of
his
conception
of
free
will
in
an
appendix
of
book
chap
ii
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
true
as
i
afterwards
say
that
we
sometimes
identify
ourselves
with
passion
or
appetite
in
conscious
conflict
with
reason
and
then
the
rule
of
reason
is
apt
to
appear
an
external
constraint
and
obedience
to
it
a
servitude
if
not
a
slavery
the
difficulty
which
socrates
and
the
socratic
schools
had
in
conceiving
a
man
to
choose
deliberately
what
he
knows
to
be
bad
for
him
a
difficulty
which
drives
aristotle
into
real
determinism
in
his
account
of
purposed
action
even
while
he
is
expressly
maintaining
the
voluntariness
and
responsibility
of
vice
seems
to
be
much
reduced
for
the
modern
mind
by
the
distinction
between
moral
and
prudential
judgments
and
the
conflict
between
interest
and
being
thus
familiar
with
the
conception
of
deliberate
choice
consciously
opposed
to
interest
to
duty
we
can
without
much
difficulty
conceive
of
such
choice
in
conscious
opposition
to
both
see
chap
ix
of
this
book
it
is
most
convenient
to
regard
intention
as
including
not
only
such
results
of
volition
as
the
agent
to
realise
but
also
any
that
without
desiring
he
foresaw
as
certain
or
probable
the
question
how
far
we
are
responsible
for
all
the
foreseen
consequences
of
our
acts
or
in
the
case
of
acts
prescribed
by
definite
moral
rules
only
for
their
results
within
a
certain
range
will
be
considered
when
we
come
to
examine
the
intuitional
method
in
a
subsequent
chapter
chap
ix
of
this
book
i
shall
examine
more
fully
the
relation
of
the
antithesis
right
and
wrong
to
the
vaguer
and
wider
antithesis
good
and
bad
in
our
practical
reasonings
it
is
not
uncommon
for
determinists
to
conceive
of
each
volition
as
connected
by
uniform
laws
with
our
past
state
of
consciousness
but
any
uniformities
we
might
trace
among
a
man
s
past
consciousnesses
even
if
we
knew
them
all
would
yet
give
us
very
imperfect
guidance
as
to
his
future
action
as
there
would
be
left
out
of
account
all
inborn
tendencies
and
susceptibilities
as
yet
latent
or
incompletely
exhibited
all
past
physical
influences
of
which
the
effects
had
not
been
perfectly
represented
in
consciousness
i
do
not
mean
that
this
is
the
only
view
that
we
take
of
the
conduct
of
others
i
hold
as
will
presently
appear
that
in
judging
of
their
conduct
morally
we
ordinarily
apply
the
conception
of
free
will
but
we
do
not
ordinarily
regard
it
as
one
kind
of
causation
limiting
and
counteracting
the
other
kind
it
is
not
the
possibility
of
merely
indeterminate
choice
of
an
arbitrary
freak
of
unmotived
willing
with
which
we
are
concerned
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
but
the
possibility
of
choosing
between
rational
and
irrational
motives
i
think
that
in
most
cases
when
a
man
yields
to
temptation
judging
that
it
is
no
use
trying
to
resist
he
judges
in
due
to
the
influence
of
appetite
or
passion
disturbing
the
process
of
reasoning
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
is
likely
to
take
a
determinist
form
in
the
mind
of
one
who
has
adopted
determinism
as
a
speculative
opinion
but
i
see
no
reason
for
thinking
that
a
libertarian
is
not
in
equal
danger
of
though
in
his
case
it
will
take
a
different
form
where
a
determinist
would
reason
i
certainly
shall
take
my
usual
glass
of
brandy
so
there
is
no
use
resolving
not
to
take
it
the
libertarian
s
reasoning
would
be
i
mean
to
leave
off
that
brandy
but
it
will
be
just
as
easy
to
leave
it
off
as
i
will
therefore
have
one
more
glass
and
leave
it
off
there
is
however
a
special
case
in
which
this
probability
may
be
indirectly
a
reason
for
not
resolving
to
do
what
would
otherwise
be
best
where
this
resolution
would
only
be
right
if
followed
by
subsequent
resolutions
the
problem
thus
presented
is
considered
later
pp
i
should
admit
indeed
that
the
ordinary
notion
of
merit
becomes
inapplicable
see
pp
but
i
do
not
see
that
perfection
becomes
less
an
end
to
be
aimed
at
because
we
cease
to
regard
its
attainment
as
meritorious
the
inapplicability
of
the
notion
of
merit
to
divine
action
has
never
been
felt
to
detract
from
the
perfection
of
the
divine
nature

ii

and
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
treatise
i
ought
however
to
point
out
that
an
important
section
of
theologians
who
have
held
the
belief
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
in
its
intensest
form
have
been
determinists
in
order
to
determine
this
we
should
require
first
to
settle
another
disputed
question
as
to
the
general
reasonableness
of
our
expectation
that
the
future
will
resemble
the
past
see
book
iii
chap
thus
we
find
it
necessary
to
punish
negligence
when
its
effects
were
very
grave
even
when
we
can
not
trace
it
to
wilful
disregard
of
duty
and
to
punish
rebellion
and
assassination
none
the
less
although
we
know
that
they
were
prompted
by
a
sincere
desire
to
serve
god
or
to
benefit
mankind
it
should
be
observed
that
the
same
kind
of
change
is
sometimes
brought
about
without
volition
by
a
powerful
emotional
shock
due
to
extraneous
causes
and
hence
it
might
be
inferred
that
in
all
cases
it
is
a
powerful
impression
of
an
emotional
kind
that
produces
the
effect
and
that
the
will
is
only
concerned
in
concentrating
our
attention
on
the
benefits
to
be
gained
or
evils
to
be
avoided
by
the
change
of
habit
and
so
intensifying
the
impression
of
these
but
though
this
kind
of
voluntary
contemplation
is
a
useful
auxiliary
to
good
resolutions
it
does
not
seem
to
be
this
effort
of
will
that
constitutes
the
resolution
we
can
clearly
distinguish
the
two
hence
this
third
effect
of
volition
can
not
be
resolved
into
the
second
but
must
be
stated
separately
chapter
vi
ethical
principles
and
methods
the
results
of
the
three
preceding
chapters
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows
the
aim
of
ethics
is
to
systematise
and
free
from
error
the
apparent
cognitions
that
most
men
have
of
the
rightness
or
reasonableness
of
conduct
whether
the
conduct
be
considered
as
right
in
itself
or
as
the
means
to
some
end
commonly
conceived
as
ultimately
reasonable
these
cognitions
are
normally
accompanied
by
emotions
of
various
kinds
known
as
moral
sentiments
but
an
ethical
judgment
can
not
be
explained
as
affirming
merely
the
existence
of
such
a
sentiment
indeed
it
is
an
essential
characteristic
of
a
moral
feeling
that
it
is
bound
up
with
an
apparent
cognition
of
something
more
than
mere
feeling
such
cognitions
again
i
have
called
dictates
or
imperatives
because
in
so
far
as
they
relate
to
conduct
on
which
any
one
is
deliberating
they
are
accompanied
by
a
certain
impulse
to
do
the
acts
recognised
as
right
which
is
liable
to
conflict
with
other
impulses
provided
this
impulse
is
effective
in
producing
right
volition
it
is
not
of
primary
importance
for
ethical
purposes
to
determine
the
exact
characteristics
of
the
emotional
states
that
precede
such
volitions
and
this
remains
true
even
if
the
force
actually
operating
on
his
will
is
mere
desire
for
the
pleasures
that
he
foresees
will
attend
right
conduct
or
aversion
to
the
pains
that
will
result
from
doing
wrong
though
we
observe
that
in
this
case
his
action
does
not
correspond
to
our
common
notion
of
strictly
virtuous
conduct
and
though
there
seems
to
be
no
ground
for
regarding
such
desires
and
aversions
as
the
sole
or
even
the
normal
motives
of
human
volitions
nor
again
is
it
generally
important
to
determine
whether
we
are
always
metaphysically
speaking
free
to
do
what
we
clearly
see
to
be
right
what
i
ought
to
do
in
the
strictest
use
of
the
word
ought
is
always
in
my
power
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
obstacle
to
my
doing
it
except
absence
of
adequate
motive
and
it
is
ordinarily
impossible
for
me
in
deliberation
to
regard
such
absence
of
motive
as
a
reason
for
not
doing
what
i
otherwise
judge
to
be
reasonable
what
then
do
we
commonly
regard
as
valid
ultimate
reasons
for
acting
or
abstaining
this
as
was
said
is
the
for
the
discussions
of
the
present
treatise
which
is
not
primarily
concerned
with
proving
or
disproving
the
validity
of
any
such
reasons
but
rather
with
the
critical
exposition
of
the
different
methods
or
rational
procedures
for
determining
right
conduct
in
any
particular
case
which
are
logically
connected
with
the
different
ultimate
reasons
widely
accepted
in
the
first
chapter
we
found
that
such
reasons
were
supplied
by
the
notions
of
happiness
and
excellence
or
perfection
including
virtue
or
moral
perfection
as
a
prominent
element
regarded
as
ultimate
ends
and
duty
as
prescribed
by
unconditional
rules
this
threefold
difference
in
the
conception
of
the
ultimate
reason
for
conduct
corresponds
to
what
seem
the
most
fundamental
distinctions
that
we
apply
to
human
existence
the
distinction
between
the
conscious
being
and
the
stream
of
conscious
experience
and
the
distinction
within
this
latter
of
action
and
feeling
for
perfection
is
put
forward
as
the
ideal
goal
of
the
development
of
a
human
being
considered
as
a
permanent
entity
while
by
duty
we
mean
the
kind
of
action
that
we
think
ought
to
be
done
and
similarly
by
happiness
or
pleasure
we
mean
an
ultimately
desired
or
desirable
kind
of
feeling
it
may
seem
however
that
these
notions
by
no
means
exhaust
the
list
of
reasons
which
are
widely
accepted
as
ultimate
grounds
of
action
many
religious
persons
think
that
the
highest
reason
for
doing
anything
is
that
it
is
god
s
will
while
to
others
or
and
to
others
again
life
according
to
nature
appear
the
really
ultimate
ends
and
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
why
conceptions
such
as
these
are
regarded
as
supplying
deeper
and
more
completely
satisfying
answers
to
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
than
those
before
named
since
they
do
not
merely
represent
what
ought
to
be
as
such
they
represent
it
in
an
apparently
simple
relation
to
what
actually
is
god
nature
self
are
the
fundamental
facts
of
existence
the
knowledge
of
what
will
accomplish
god
s
will
what
is
according
to
nature
what
will
realise
the
true
self
in
each
of
us
would
seem
to
solve
the
deepest
problems
of
metaphysics
as
well
as
of
ethics
but
just
because
these
notions
combine
the
ideal
with
the
actual
their
proper
sphere
belongs
not
to
ethics
as
i
define
it
but
to
philosophy
the
central
and
supreme
study
which
is
concerned
with
the
relations
of
all
objects
of
knowledge
the
introduction
of
these
notions
into
ethics
is
liable
to
bring
with
it
a
fundamental
confusion
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
destructive
of
all
clearness
in
ethical
reasoning
and
if
this
confusion
is
avoided
the
strictly
ethical
import
of
such
notions
when
made
explicit
appears
always
to
lead
us
to
one
or
other
of
the
methods
previously
distinguished
there
is
least
danger
of
confusion
in
the
case
of
the
theological
conception
of
god
s
will
since
here
the
connexion
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
is
perfectly
clear
and
explicit
the
content
of
god
s
will
we
conceive
as
presently
existing
in
idea
its
actualisation
is
the
end
to
be
aimed
at
there
is
indeed
a
difficulty
in
understanding
how
god
s
will
can
fail
to
be
realised
whether
we
do
right
or
wrong
or
how
if
it
can
not
fail
to
be
realised
in
either
case
its
realisation
can
give
the
ultimate
motive
for
doing
right
but
this
difficulty
it
belongs
to
theology
rather
than
ethics
to
solve
the
practical
question
is
assuming
that
god
wills
in
a
special
sense
what
we
ought
to
do
how
we
are
to
ascertain
this
in
any
particular
case
this
must
be
either
by
revelation
or
by
reason
or
by
both
combined
if
an
external
revelation
is
proposed
as
the
standard
we
are
obviously
carried
beyond
the
range
of
our
study
on
the
other
hand
when
we
try
to
ascertain
by
reason
the
divine
will
the
conception
seems
to
present
itself
as
a
common
form
under
which
a
religious
mind
is
disposed
to
regard
whatever
method
of
determining
conduct
it
apprehends
to
be
rational
since
we
can
not
know
any
act
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
divine
will
which
we
do
not
also
by
the
same
exercise
of
thought
know
to
be
dictated
by
reason
thus
commonly
it
is
either
assumed
that
god
desires
the
happiness
of
men
in
which
case
our
efforts
should
be
concentrated
on
its
production
or
that
he
desires
their
perfection
and
that
that
should
be
our
end
or
that
whatever
his
end
may
be
into
which
perhaps
we
have
no
right
to
inquire
his
laws
are
immediately
cognisable
being
in
fact
the
first
principles
of
intuitional
morality
or
perhaps
it
is
explained
that
god
s
will
is
to
be
learnt
by
examining
our
own
constitution
or
that
of
the
world
we
are
in
so
that
conformity
to
god
s
will
seems
to
resolve
itself
into
or
life
according
to
in
any
case
this
conception
however
important
it
may
be
in
supplying
new
motives
for
doing
what
we
believe
to
be
right
does
not
apart
from
revelation
suggest
any
special
criterion
of
rightness
let
us
pass
to
consider
the
notions
nature
natural
conformity
to
i
assume
in
order
to
obtain
a
principle
distinct
from
that
the
nature
to
which
we
are
to
conform
is
not
each
one
s
own
individual
nature
but
human
nature
generally
considered
either
apart
from
or
in
relation
to
its
environment
that
we
are
to
find
the
standard
of
right
conduct
in
a
certain
type
of
human
existence
which
we
can
somehow
abstract
from
observation
of
actual
human
life
now
in
a
certain
sense
every
rational
man
must
of
course
conform
to
nature
that
is
in
aiming
at
any
ends
he
must
adapt
his
efforts
to
the
particular
conditions
of
his
existence
physical
and
psychical
but
if
he
is
to
go
beyond
this
and
conform
to
nature
in
the
adoption
of
an
ultimate
end
or
paramount
standard
of
right
conduct
it
must
be
on
the
basis
if
not
of
strictly
theological
assumptions
at
any
rate
of
the
more
or
less
definite
recognition
of
design
exhibited
in
the
empirically
known
world
if
we
find
no
design
in
nature
if
the
complex
processes
of
the
world
known
to
us
through
experience
are
conceived
as
an
aimless
though
orderly
drift
of
change
the
knowledge
of
these
processes
and
their
laws
may
indeed
limit
the
aims
of
rational
beings
but
i
can
not
conceive
how
it
can
determine
the
ends
of
their
action
or
be
a
source
of
unconditional
rules
of
duty
and
in
fact
those
who
use
natural
as
an
ethical
notion
do
commonly
suppose
that
by
contemplating
the
actual
play
of
human
impulses
or
the
physical
constitution
of
man
or
his
social
relations
we
may
find
principles
for
determining
positively
and
completely
the
kind
of
life
he
was
designed
to
live
i
think
however
that
every
attempt
thus
to
derive
what
ought
to
be
from
what
is
palpably
fails
the
moment
it
is
freed
from
fundamental
confusions
of
thought
for
instance
suppose
we
seek
practical
guidance
in
the
conception
of
human
nature
regarded
as
a
system
of
impulses
and
dispositions
we
must
obviously
give
a
special
precision
to
the
meaning
of
natural
since
in
a
sense
as
butler
observes
any
impulse
is
natural
but
it
is
manifestly
idle
to
bid
us
follow
nature
in
this
sense
for
the
question
of
duty
is
never
raised
except
when
we
are
conscious
of
a
conflict
of
impulses
and
wish
to
know
which
to
follow
nor
does
it
help
us
to
say
that
the
supremacy
of
reason
is
natural
as
we
have
started
by
assuming
that
what
reason
prescribes
is
conformity
to
nature
and
thus
our
line
of
thought
would
become
circular
the
nature
that
we
are
to
follow
must
be
distinguished
from
our
practical
reason
if
it
is
to
become
a
guide
to
it
how
then
are
we
to
distinguish
natural
impulses
in
the
sense
in
which
they
are
to
guide
rational
choice
from
the
unnatural
those
who
have
occupied
themselves
with
this
distinction
seem
generally
to
have
interpreted
the
natural
to
mean
either
the
as
opposed
to
the
rare
and
exceptional
or
the
as
opposed
to
what
is
later
in
development
or
negatively
what
is
not
the
effect
of
human
volition
but
i
have
never
seen
any
ground
for
assuming
broadly
that
nature
abhors
the
exceptional
or
prefers
the
earlier
in
time
to
the
later
and
when
we
take
a
retrospective
view
of
the
history
of
the
human
race
we
find
that
some
impulses
which
all
admire
such
as
the
love
of
knowledge
and
enthusiastic
philanthropy
are
both
rarer
and
later
in
their
appearance
than
others
which
all
judge
to
be
lower
again
it
is
obviously
unwarrantable
to
eschew
as
unnatural
and
opposed
to
the
divine
design
all
such
impulses
as
have
been
produced
in
us
by
the
institutions
of
society
or
our
use
of
human
arrangements
and
contrivances
or
that
result
in
any
way
from
the
deliberate
action
of
our
for
this
were
arbitrarily
to
exclude
society
and
human
action
from
the
scope
of
nature
s
purposes
and
besides
it
is
clear
that
many
impulses
so
generated
appear
to
be
either
moral
or
auxiliary
to
morality
and
in
other
ways
beneficial
and
though
others
no
doubt
are
pernicious
and
misleading
it
seems
that
we
can
only
distinguish
these
latter
from
the
former
by
taking
note
of
their
effects
and
not
by
any
precision
that
reflection
can
give
to
the
notion
of
if
again
we
fall
back
upon
a
more
physical
view
of
our
nature
and
endeavour
to
ascertain
for
what
end
our
corporeal
frame
was
constructed
we
find
that
such
contemplation
determines
very
little
we
can
infer
from
our
nutritive
system
that
we
are
intended
to
take
food
and
similarly
that
we
are
to
exercise
our
various
muscles
in
some
way
or
other
and
our
brain
and
organs
of
sense
but
this
carries
us
a
very
trifling
way
for
the
practical
question
almost
always
is
not
whether
we
are
to
use
our
organs
or
leave
them
unused
but
to
what
extent
or
in
what
manner
we
are
to
use
them
and
it
does
not
appear
that
a
definite
answer
to
this
question
can
ever
be
elicited
by
a
logical
process
of
inference
from
observations
of
the
human
organism
and
the
actual
physical
life
of
men
if
finally
we
consider
man
in
his
social
relations
as
father
son
neighbour
citizen
and
endeavour
to
determine
the
natural
rights
and
obligations
that
attach
to
such
relations
we
find
that
the
conception
natural
presents
a
problem
and
not
a
solution
to
an
unreflective
mind
what
is
customary
in
social
relations
usually
appears
natural
but
no
reflective
person
is
prepared
to
lay
down
conformity
to
custom
as
a
fundamental
moral
principle
the
problem
then
is
to
find
in
the
rights
and
obligations
established
by
custom
in
a
particular
society
at
a
particular
time
an
element
that
has
a
binding
force
beyond
what
mere
custom
can
give
and
this
problem
can
only
be
solved
by
reference
to
the
ultimate
good
of
social
existence
whether
conceived
as
happiness
or
as
perfection
or
by
appealing
to
some
intuitively
known
principle
of
social
duty
other
than
the
principle
of
aiming
at
the
happiness
or
perfection
of
society
nor
again
does
it
help
us
to
adopt
the
more
modern
view
of
nature
which
regards
the
organic
world
as
exhibiting
not
an
aggregate
of
fixed
types
but
a
continuous
and
gradual
process
of
changing
life
for
granting
that
this
evolution
as
the
name
implies
is
not
merely
a
process
from
old
to
new
but
a
progress
from
less
to
more
of
certain
definite
characteristics
it
is
surely
absurd
to
maintain
that
we
ought
to
take
these
characteristics
as
ultimate
good
and
make
it
our
whole
endeavour
to
accelerate
the
arrival
of
an
inevitable
future
that
whatever
is
to
be
will
be
better
than
what
is
we
all
hope
but
there
seems
to
be
no
more
reason
for
summarily
identifying
what
ought
to
be
with
what
certainly
will
be
than
for
finding
it
in
what
commonly
is
or
what
originally
on
the
whole
it
appears
to
me
that
no
definition
that
has
ever
been
offered
of
the
natural
exhibits
this
notion
as
really
capable
of
furnishing
an
independent
ethical
first
principle
and
no
one
maintains
that
natural
like
beautiful
is
a
notion
that
though
indefinable
is
yet
clear
being
derived
from
a
simple
unanalysable
impression
hence
i
see
no
way
of
extracting
from
it
a
definite
practical
criterion
of
the
rightness
of
actions
the
discussion
in
the
preceding
section
will
have
shown
that
not
all
the
different
views
that
are
taken
of
the
ultimate
reason
for
doing
what
is
concluded
to
be
right
lead
to
practically
different
methods
of
arriving
at
this
conclusion
indeed
we
find
that
almost
any
method
may
be
connected
with
almost
any
ultimate
reason
by
means
of
some
often
plausible
assumption
hence
arises
difficulty
in
the
classification
and
comparison
of
ethical
systems
since
they
often
appear
to
have
different
affinities
according
as
we
consider
method
or
ultimate
reason
in
my
treatment
of
the
subject
difference
of
method
is
taken
as
the
paramount
consideration
and
it
is
on
this
account
that
i
have
treated
the
view
in
which
perfection
is
taken
to
be
the
ultimate
end
as
a
variety
of
the
intuitionism
which
determines
right
conduct
by
reference
to
axioms
of
duty
intuitively
known
while
i
have
made
as
marked
a
separation
as
possible
between
epicureanism
or
egoistic
hedonism
and
the
universalistic
or
benthamite
hedonism
to
which
i
propose
to
restrict
the
term
utilitarianism
i
am
aware
that
these
two
latter
methods
are
commonly
treated
as
closely
connected
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
reasons
for
this
in
the
first
place
they
agree
in
prescribing
actions
as
means
to
an
end
distinct
from
and
lying
outside
the
actions
so
that
they
both
lay
down
rules
which
are
not
absolute
but
relative
and
only
valid
if
they
conduce
to
the
end
again
the
ultimate
end
is
according
to
both
methods
the
same
in
quality
pleasure
or
more
strictly
the
maximum
of
pleasure
attainable
pains
being
subtracted
besides
it
is
of
course
to
a
great
extent
true
that
the
conduct
recommended
by
the
one
principle
coincides
with
that
inculcated
by
the
other
though
it
would
seem
to
be
only
in
an
ideal
polity
that
well
understood
leads
to
the
perfect
discharge
of
all
social
duties
still
in
a
tolerably
community
it
prompts
to
the
fulfilment
of
most
of
them
unless
under
very
exceptional
circumstances
and
on
the
other
hand
a
universalistic
hedonist
may
reasonably
hold
that
his
own
happiness
is
that
portion
of
the
universal
happiness
which
it
is
most
in
his
power
to
promote
and
which
therefore
is
most
especially
entrusted
to
his
charge
and
the
practical
blending
of
the
two
systems
is
sure
to
go
beyond
their
theoretical
coincidence
it
is
much
easier
for
a
man
to
move
in
a
sort
of
diagonal
between
egoistic
and
universalistic
hedonism
than
to
be
practically
a
consistent
adherent
of
either
few
men
are
so
completely
selfish
whatever
their
theory
of
morals
may
be
as
not
occasionally
to
promote
the
happiness
of
others
from
natural
sympathetic
impulse
unsupported
by
epicurean
calculation
and
probably
still
fewer
are
so
resolutely
unselfish
as
never
to
find
all
men
s
good
in
their
own
with
rather
too
ready
conviction
further
from
bentham
s
psychological
doctrine
that
every
human
being
always
does
aim
at
his
own
greatest
apparent
happiness
it
seems
to
follow
that
it
is
useless
to
point
out
to
a
man
the
conduct
that
would
conduce
to
the
general
happiness
unless
you
convince
him
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
conduce
to
his
own
hence
on
this
view
egoistic
and
universalistic
considerations
must
necessarily
be
combined
in
any
practical
treatment
of
morality
and
this
being
so
it
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
that
bentham
or
his
disciples
would
go
further
and
attempt
to
base
on
the
egoism
which
they
accept
as
inevitable
the
universalistic
hedonism
which
they
approve
and
inculcate
and
accordingly
we
find
that
mill
does
try
to
establish
a
logical
connexion
between
the
psychological
and
ethical
principles
which
he
holds
in
common
with
bentham
and
to
convince
his
readers
that
because
each
man
naturally
seeks
his
own
happiness
therefore
he
ought
to
seek
the
happiness
of
other
people
nevertheless
it
seems
to
me
undeniable
that
the
practical
affinity
between
utilitarianism
and
intuitionism
is
really
much
greater
than
that
between
the
two
forms
of
hedonism
my
grounds
for
holding
this
will
be
given
at
length
in
subsequent
chapters
here
i
will
only
observe
that
many
moralists
who
have
maintained
as
practically
valid
the
judgments
of
right
and
wrong
which
the
common
sense
of
mankind
seems
intuitively
to
enunciate
have
yet
regarded
general
happiness
as
an
end
to
which
the
rules
of
morality
are
the
best
means
and
have
held
that
a
knowledge
of
these
rules
was
implanted
by
nature
or
revealed
by
god
for
the
attainment
of
this
end
such
a
belief
implies
that
though
i
am
bound
to
take
as
ultimate
standard
in
acting
conformity
to
a
rule
which
is
for
me
absolute
still
the
natural
or
divine
reason
for
the
rule
laid
down
is
utilitarian
on
this
view
the
of
utilitarianism
is
certainly
rejected
the
connexion
between
right
action
and
happiness
is
not
ascertained
by
a
process
of
reasoning
but
we
can
hardly
say
that
the
utilitarian
principle
is
altogether
rejected
rather
the
limitations
of
the
human
reason
are
supposed
to
prevent
it
from
apprehending
adequately
the
real
connexion
between
the
true
principle
and
the
right
rules
of
conduct
this
connexion
however
has
always
been
to
a
large
extent
recognised
by
all
reflective
persons
indeed
so
clear
is
it
that
in
most
cases
the
observance
of
the
commonly
received
moral
rules
tends
to
render
human
life
tranquil
and
happy
that
even
moralists
as
whewell
who
are
most
strongly
opposed
to
utilitarianism
have
in
attempting
to
exhibit
the
necessity
of
moral
rules
been
led
to
dwell
on
utilitarian
considerations
and
during
the
first
period
of
ethical
controversy
in
modern
england
after
the
audacious
enunciation
of
egoism
by
hobbes
had
roused
in
real
earnest
the
search
for
a
philosophical
basis
of
morality
utilitarianism
appears
in
friendly
alliance
with
intuitionism
it
was
not
to
supersede
but
to
support
the
morality
of
common
sense
against
the
dangerous
innovations
of
hobbes
that
cumberland
declared
the
common
good
of
all
rationals
to
be
the
end
to
which
moral
rules
were
the
means
we
find
him
quoted
with
approval
by
clarke
who
is
commonly
taken
to
represent
intuitionism
in
an
extreme
form
nor
does
shaftesbury
in
introducing
the
theory
of
a
moral
sense
seem
to
have
dreamt
that
it
could
ever
impel
us
to
actions
not
clearly
conducive
to
the
good
of
the
whole
and
his
disciple
hutcheson
expressly
identified
its
promptings
with
those
of
benevolence
butler
i
think
was
our
first
influential
writer
who
dwelt
on
the
discrepancies
between
virtue
as
commonly
understood
and
conduct
likeliest
to
produce
an
overbalance
of
when
hume
presented
utilitarianism
as
a
mode
of
explaining
current
morality
it
was
seen
or
suspected
to
have
a
partially
destructive
tendency
but
it
was
not
till
the
time
of
paley
and
bentham
that
it
was
offered
as
a
method
for
determining
conduct
which
was
to
overrule
all
traditional
precepts
and
supersede
all
existing
moral
sentiments
and
even
this
final
antagonism
relates
rather
to
theory
and
method
than
to
practical
results
practical
conflict
in
ordinary
human
minds
is
mainly
between
and
social
duty
however
determined
indeed
from
a
practical
point
of
view
the
principle
of
aiming
at
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
is
more
definitely
opposed
to
egoism
than
the
morality
is
for
this
latter
seems
to
leave
a
man
free
to
pursue
his
own
happiness
under
certain
definite
limits
and
conditions
whereas
utilitarianism
seems
to
require
a
more
comprehensive
and
unceasing
subordination
of
to
the
common
good
and
thus
as
mill
remarks
utilitarianism
is
sometimes
attacked
from
two
precisely
opposite
sides
from
a
confusion
with
egoistic
hedonism
it
is
called
base
and
grovelling
while
at
the
same
time
it
is
more
plausibly
charged
with
setting
up
too
high
a
standard
of
unselfishness
and
making
exaggerated
demands
on
human
nature
a
good
deal
remains
to
be
said
in
order
to
make
the
principle
and
method
of
utilitarianism
perfectly
clear
and
explicit
but
it
seems
best
to
defer
this
till
we
come
to
the
investigation
of
its
details
it
will
be
convenient
to
take
this
as
the
final
stage
of
our
examination
of
methods
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
simpler
that
the
discussion
of
egoistic
should
precede
that
of
universalistic
hedonism
and
on
the
other
it
seems
desirable
that
we
should
obtain
in
as
exact
a
form
as
possible
the
enunciations
of
intuitive
morality
before
we
compare
these
with
the
results
of
the
more
doubtful
and
difficult
calculations
of
utilitarian
consequences
in
the
remaining
chapters
of
this
book
i
shall
endeavour
to
remove
certain
ambiguities
as
to
the
general
nature
and
relations
of
the
other
two
methods
as
designated
respectively
by
the
terms
egoism
and
intuitionism
before
proceeding
to
the
fuller
examination
of
them
in
books
ii
and
iii
i
have
called
the
ethical
doctrine
that
takes
universal
happiness
as
the
ultimate
end
and
standard
of
right
conduct
by
the
name
of
bentham
because
the
thinkers
who
have
chiefly
taught
this
doctrine
in
england
during
the
present
century
have
referred
it
to
bentham
as
their
master
and
it
certainly
seems
to
me
clear
though
bain
cf
january
appears
to
doubt
it
that
bentham
adopted
this
doctrine
explicitly
in
its
most
comprehensive
scope
at
the
earliest
stage
in
the
formation
of
his
opinions
nor
do
i
think
that
he
ever
consciously
abandoned
or
qualified
it
we
find
him
writing
in
his
book
in
cf
bowring
s
edition
vol
that
helvetius
had
established
a
standard
of
rectitude
for
actions
the
standard
being
that
a
sort
of
action
is
a
right
one
when
the
tendency
of
it
is
to
augment
the
mass
of
happiness
in
the
and
we
find
him
writing
fifty
years
later
cf
vol
the
following
account
of
his
earliest
view
in
a
passage
which
contains
no
hint
of
later
dissent
from
it
by
an
early
pamphlet
of
priestley
s
light
was
added
to
the
warmth
in
the
phrase
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
i
then
saw
delineated
for
the
first
time
a
plain
as
well
as
a
true
standard
for
whatever
is
right
or
wrong
in
human
conduct
in
the
field
of
morals
or
of
at
the
same
time
i
must
admit
that
in
other
passages
bentham
seems
no
less
explicitly
to
adopt
egoistic
hedonism
as
the
method
of
private
ethics
as
distinct
from
legislation
and
in
his
posthumous
deontology
the
two
principles
appear
to
be
reconciled
by
the
doctrine
that
it
is
always
the
individual
s
true
interest
even
from
a
purely
mundane
point
of
view
to
act
in
the
manner
most
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
this
latter
proposition
which
i
regard
as
erroneous
is
not
indeed
definitely
put
forward
in
any
of
the
treatises
published
by
bentham
in
his
lifetime
or
completely
prepared
by
him
for
publication
but
it
may
be
inferred
from
his
book
that
he
held
it
see
his
vol
pp
footnotes
as
i
have
before
said
the
applicability
of
a
method
for
determining
right
conduct
relatively
to
an
ultimate
end
whether
happiness
or
perfection
does
not
necessarily
depend
on
the
acceptance
of
the
end
as
prescribed
by
reason
it
only
requires
that
it
should
be
in
some
way
adopted
as
ultimate
and
paramount
i
have
however
confined
my
attention
in
this
treatise
to
ends
which
are
widely
accepted
as
reasonable
and
i
shall
afterwards
endeavour
to
exhibit
the
practical
axioms
which
appear
to
me
to
be
implied
in
this
acceptance
cf
book
iii
chap
xiii
the
notion
of
will
be
more
conveniently
examined
in
the
following
chapter
where
i
shall
distinguish
different
interpretations
of
the
term
egoism
which
i
have
taken
to
denote
one
of
the
three
principal
species
of
ethical
method
see
note
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
see
note
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
we
shall
have
occasion
to
consider
mill
s
argument
on
this
point
in
a
subsequent
chapter
cf
book
iii
chap
xiii
it
should
be
observed
that
neither
cumberland
nor
shaftesbury
uses
the
term
good
substantive
in
a
purely
and
exclusively
hedonistic
sense
but
shaftesbury
uses
it
mainly
in
this
sense
and
cumberland
s
good
includes
happiness
as
well
as
perfection

the
nature
of
appended
to
the
it
may
be
interesting
to
notice
a
gradual
change
in
butler
s
view
on
this
important
point
in
the
first
of
his
sermons
on
human
nature
published
some
years
before
the
he
does
not
notice
any
more
than
shaftesbury
and
hutcheson
any
possible
want
of
harmony
between
conscience
and
benevolence
a
note
to
sermon
however
seems
to
indicate
a
stage
of
transition
between
the
view
of
the
first
sermon
and
the
view
of
the
dissertation
chapter
vii
egoism
and
in
the
preceding
chapters
i
have
used
the
term
egoism
as
it
is
most
commonly
used
to
denote
a
system
which
prescribes
actions
as
means
to
the
end
of
the
individual
s
happiness
or
pleasure
the
ruling
motive
in
such
a
system
is
commonly
said
to
be
but
both
terms
admit
of
other
interpretations
which
it
will
be
well
to
distinguish
and
set
aside
before
proceeding
further
for
example
the
term
egoistic
is
ordinarily
and
not
improperly
applied
to
the
basis
on
which
hobbes
attempted
to
construct
morality
and
on
which
alone
as
he
held
the
social
order
could
firmly
rest
and
escape
the
storms
and
convulsions
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
menaced
from
the
vagaries
of
the
unenlightened
conscience
but
it
is
not
strictly
the
end
of
egoism
as
i
have
defined
it
greatest
attainable
pleasure
for
the
individual
but
rather
which
determines
the
first
of
those
precepts
of
rational
egoism
which
hobbes
calls
laws
of
nature
seek
peace
and
ensue
and
in
the
development
of
his
system
we
often
find
that
it
is
preservation
rather
than
pleasure
or
perhaps
a
compromise
between
the
two
that
is
taken
as
the
ultimate
end
and
standard
of
right
conduct
again
in
spinoza
s
view
the
principle
of
rational
action
is
necessarily
egoistic
and
is
as
with
hobbes
the
impulse
of
the
individual
mind
says
spinoza
like
everything
else
strives
so
far
as
it
is
able
to
continue
in
its
state
of
being
indeed
this
effort
is
its
very
essence
it
is
true
that
the
object
of
this
impulse
can
not
be
separated
from
pleasure
or
joy
because
pleasure
or
joy
is
a
passion
in
which
the
soul
passes
to
higher
still
it
is
not
at
pleasure
that
the
impulse
primarily
aims
but
at
the
mind
s
perfection
or
reality
as
we
should
now
say
at
or
of
this
according
to
spinoza
the
highest
form
consists
in
a
clear
comprehension
of
all
things
in
their
necessary
order
as
modifications
of
the
one
divine
being
and
that
willing
acceptance
of
all
which
springs
from
this
comprehension
in
this
state
the
mind
is
purely
active
without
any
admixture
of
passion
or
passivity
and
thus
its
essential
nature
is
realised
or
actualised
to
the
greatest
possible
degree
we
perceive
that
this
is
the
notion
of
as
defined
not
only
but
a
philosopher
and
that
it
would
mean
something
quite
different
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
action
such
for
example
as
the
reflective
dramatist
of
germany
introduces
exclaiming
ich
kann
mich
nicht
wie
so
ein
wortheld
so
ein
an
meinem
willen
wärmen
und
gedanken
wenn
ich
nicht
wirke
mehr
bin
ich
vernichtet
the
artist
again
often
contemplates
his
production
of
the
beautiful
as
a
realisation
of
self
and
moralists
of
a
certain
turn
of
mind
in
all
ages
have
similarly
regarded
the
sacrifice
of
inclination
to
duty
as
the
highest
form
of
and
held
that
true
prompts
us
always
to
obey
the
commands
issued
by
the
governing
principle
reason
or
conscience
within
us
as
in
such
obedience
however
painful
we
shall
be
realising
our
truest
self
we
see
in
short
that
the
term
egoism
so
far
as
it
merely
implies
that
reference
is
made
to
self
in
laying
down
first
principles
of
conduct
does
not
really
indicate
in
any
way
the
substance
of
such
principles
for
all
our
impulses
high
and
low
sensual
and
moral
alike
are
so
far
similarly
related
to
self
that
except
when
two
or
more
impulses
come
into
conscious
conflict
we
tend
to
identify
ourselves
with
each
as
it
arises
thus
may
be
prominent
in
yielding
to
any
impulse
and
egoism
in
so
far
as
it
merely
implies
such
prominence
is
a
common
form
applicable
to
all
principles
of
action
it
may
be
said
however
that
we
do
not
properly
speaking
develop
or
realise
self
by
yielding
to
the
impulse
which
happens
to
be
predominant
in
us
but
by
exercising
each
in
its
due
place
and
proper
degree
all
the
different
faculties
capacities
and
propensities
of
which
our
nature
is
made
up
but
here
there
is
an
important
ambiguity
what
do
we
mean
by
due
proportion
and
proper
degree
these
terms
may
imply
an
ideal
into
conformity
with
which
the
individual
mind
has
to
be
trained
by
restraining
some
of
its
natural
impulses
and
strengthening
others
and
developing
its
higher
faculties
rather
than
its
lower
or
they
may
merely
refer
to
the
original
combination
and
proportion
of
tendencies
in
the
character
with
which
each
is
born
to
this
it
may
be
meant
we
ought
to
adapt
as
far
as
possible
the
circumstances
in
which
we
place
ourselves
and
the
functions
which
we
choose
to
exercise
in
order
that
we
may
be
ourselves
live
our
own
life
etc
according
to
the
former
interpretation
rational
is
merely
another
term
for
the
pursuit
of
perfection
for
oneself
while
in
the
latter
sense
it
hardly
appears
that
when
clearly
distinguished
is
really
put
forward
as
an
absolute
end
but
rather
as
a
means
to
happiness
for
supposing
a
man
to
have
inherited
propensities
clearly
tending
to
his
own
unhappiness
no
one
would
recommend
him
to
develop
these
as
fully
as
possible
instead
of
modifying
or
subduing
them
in
some
way
whether
actually
the
best
way
of
seeking
happiness
is
to
give
free
play
to
one
s
nature
we
will
hereafter
consider
in
the
course
of
our
examination
of
hedonism
on
the
whole
then
i
conclude
that
the
notion
of
is
to
be
avoided
in
a
treatise
on
ethical
method
on
account
of
its
indefiniteness
and
for
a
similar
reason
we
must
discard
a
common
account
of
egoism
which
describes
its
ultimate
end
as
the
good
of
the
individual
for
the
term
good
may
cover
all
possible
views
of
the
ultimate
end
of
rational
conduct
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
egoism
in
this
sense
was
assumed
in
the
whole
ethical
controversy
of
ancient
greece
that
is
it
was
assumed
on
all
sides
that
a
rational
individual
would
make
the
pursuit
of
his
own
good
his
supreme
aim
the
controverted
question
was
whether
this
good
was
rightly
conceived
as
pleasure
or
virtue
or
any
nor
is
the
ambiguity
removed
if
we
follow
aristotle
in
confining
our
attention
to
the
good
attainable
in
human
life
and
call
this
εὐδαιμονία
for
we
may
still
argue
with
the
stoics
that
virtuous
or
excellent
activities
and
not
pleasures
are
the
elements
of
which
true
human
is
composed
indeed
aristotle
himself
adopts
this
view
so
far
as
to
determine
the
details
of
accordingly
though
he
does
not
with
the
stoics
regard
the
pursuit
of
virtue
and
that
of
pleasure
as
competing
alternatives
holding
rather
that
the
best
pleasure
is
an
inseparable
concomitant
of
the
most
excellent
action
even
the
english
term
happiness
is
not
free
from
a
similar
ambiguity
it
seems
indeed
to
be
commonly
used
in
bentham
s
way
as
convertible
with
pleasure
or
rather
as
denoting
that
of
which
the
constituents
are
pleasures
and
it
is
in
this
sense
that
i
think
it
most
convenient
to
use
it
sometimes
however
in
ordinary
discourse
the
term
is
rather
employed
to
denote
a
particular
kind
of
agreeable
consciousness
which
is
distinguished
from
and
even
contrasted
with
definite
specific
pleasures
such
as
the
gratifications
of
sensual
appetite
or
other
keen
and
vehement
desires
as
being
at
once
calmer
and
more
indefinite
we
may
characterise
it
as
the
feeling
which
accompanies
the
normal
activity
of
a
healthy
mind
in
a
healthy
body
and
of
which
specific
pleasures
seem
to
be
rather
stimulants
than
elements
sometimes
again
though
i
think
with
a
more
manifest
divergence
from
common
usage
happiness
or
true
happiness
is
understood
in
a
definitely
sense
as
denoting
results
other
than
agreeable
feelings
of
any
kind
to
be
clear
then
we
must
particularise
as
the
object
of
and
end
of
the
method
which
i
have
distinguished
as
egoistic
hedonism
pleasure
taken
in
its
widest
sense
as
including
every
species
of
delight
enjoyment
or
satisfaction
except
so
far
as
any
particular
species
may
be
excluded
by
its
incompatibility
with
some
greater
pleasures
or
as
necessarily
involving
concomitant
or
subsequent
pains
it
is
thus
that
seems
to
be
understood
by
butler
and
other
english
moralists
after
him
as
a
desire
of
one
s
own
pleasure
generally
and
of
the
greatest
amount
of
it
obtainable
from
whatever
source
it
may
be
obtained
in
fact
it
is
upon
this
generality
and
comprehensiveness
that
the
authority
and
reasonableness
attributed
to
in
butler
s
system
are
founded
for
satisfaction
or
pleasure
of
some
kind
results
from
gratifying
any
impulse
thus
when
antagonistic
impulses
compete
for
the
determination
of
the
will
we
are
prompted
by
the
desire
for
pleasure
in
general
to
compare
the
pleasures
which
we
foresee
will
respectively
attend
the
gratification
of
either
impulse
and
when
we
have
ascertained
which
set
of
pleasures
is
the
greatest
or
the
desire
for
pleasure
in
general
reinforces
the
corresponding
impulse
it
is
thus
called
into
play
whenever
impulses
conflict
and
is
therefore
naturally
regulative
and
directive
as
butler
argues
of
other
springs
of
action
on
this
view
so
far
as
operates
we
merely
consider
the
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
to
use
bentham
s
illustration
quantity
of
pleasure
being
equal
is
as
good
as
this
position
however
seems
to
many
offensively
paradoxical
and
mill
in
his
development
of
bentham
s
doctrine
thought
it
desirable
to
abandon
it
and
to
take
into
account
differences
in
quality
among
pleasures
as
well
as
differences
in
degree
now
here
we
may
observe
first
that
it
is
quite
consistent
with
the
view
quoted
as
bentham
s
to
describe
some
kinds
of
pleasure
as
inferior
in
quality
to
others
if
by
a
pleasure
we
mean
as
is
often
meant
a
whole
state
of
consciousness
which
is
only
partly
pleasurable
and
still
more
if
we
take
into
view
subsequent
states
for
many
pleasures
are
not
free
from
pain
even
while
enjoyed
and
many
more
have
painful
consequences
such
pleasures
are
in
bentham
s
phrase
impure
and
as
the
pain
has
to
be
set
off
as
a
drawback
in
valuing
the
pleasure
it
is
in
accordance
with
strictly
quantitative
measurement
of
pleasure
to
call
them
inferior
in
kind
and
again
we
must
be
careful
not
to
confound
intensity
of
with
intensity
of
as
a
pleasant
feeling
may
be
strong
and
absorbing
and
yet
not
so
pleasant
as
another
that
is
more
subtle
and
delicate
with
these
explanations
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
work
out
consistently
the
method
that
takes
pleasure
as
the
sole
ultimate
end
of
rational
conduct
bentham
s
proposition
must
be
accepted
and
all
comparison
of
pleasures
must
really
resolve
itself
into
quantitative
for
all
pleasures
are
understood
to
be
so
called
because
they
have
a
common
property
of
pleasantness
and
may
therefore
be
compared
in
respect
of
this
common
property
if
then
what
we
are
seeking
is
pleasure
as
such
and
pleasure
alone
we
must
evidently
always
prefer
the
more
pleasant
pleasure
to
the
less
pleasant
no
other
choice
seems
reasonable
unless
we
are
aiming
at
something
besides
pleasure
and
often
when
we
say
that
one
kind
of
pleasure
is
better
than
another
as
that
the
pleasures
of
reciprocated
affection
are
superior
in
quality
to
the
pleasures
of
gratified
appetite
we
mean
that
they
are
more
pleasant
no
doubt
we
may
mean
something
else
we
may
mean
for
instance
that
they
are
nobler
and
more
elevated
although
less
pleasant
but
then
we
are
clearly
introducing
a
ground
of
preference
and
if
this
is
done
the
method
adopted
is
a
perplexing
mixture
of
intuitionism
and
hedonism
to
sum
up
egoism
if
we
merely
understand
by
it
a
method
that
aims
at
seems
to
be
a
form
into
which
almost
any
ethical
system
may
be
thrown
without
modifying
its
essential
characteristics
and
even
when
further
defined
egoistic
hedonism
it
is
still
imperfectly
distinguishable
from
intuitionism
if
quality
of
pleasures
is
admitted
as
a
consideration
distinct
from
and
overruling
quantity
there
remains
then
pure
or
quantitative
egoistic
hedonism
which
as
a
method
essentially
distinct
from
all
others
and
widely
maintained
to
be
rational
seems
to
deserve
a
detailed
examination
according
to
this
the
rational
agent
regards
quantity
of
consequent
pleasure
and
pain
to
himself
as
alone
important
in
choosing
between
alternatives
of
action
and
seeks
always
the
greatest
attainable
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
which
without
violation
of
usage
we
may
designate
as
his
greatest
it
seems
to
be
this
view
and
attitude
of
mind
which
is
most
commonly
intended
by
the
vaguer
terms
egoism
egoistic
and
therefore
i
shall
allow
myself
to
use
these
terms
in
this
more
precise
signification
footnotes
thus
the
end
for
which
an
individual
is
supposed
to
renounce
the
unlimited
rights
of
the
state
of
nature
is
said
chap
xiv
to
be
nothing
else
but
the
security
of
a
man
s
person
in
this
life
and
the
means
of
preserving
life
so
as
not
to
be
weary
of
schiller
s
i
shall
afterwards
try
to
explain
how
it
comes
about
that
in
modern
thought
the
proposition
my
own
good
is
my
only
reasonable
ultimate
end
is
not
a
mere
tautology
even
though
we
define
good
as
that
at
which
it
is
ultimately
reasonable
to
aim
cf
chap
ix
and
book
iii
chaps
xiii
xiv
aristotle
s
selection
of
εὐδαιμονία
to
denote
what
he
elsewhere
calls
human
or
practicable
good
and
the
fact
that
after
all
we
have
no
better
rendering
for
εὐδαιμονία
than
happiness
or
felicity
has
caused
no
little
misunderstanding
of
his
system
thus
when
stewart
of
the
active
and
moral
book
ii
chap
ii
says
that
by
many
of
the
best
of
the
ancient
moralists
the
whole
of
ethics
was
reduced
to
this
question
what
is
most
conducive
on
the
whole
to
our
happiness
the
remark
if
not
exactly
false
is
certain
to
mislead
his
readers
since
by
stewart
as
by
most
english
writers
happiness
is
definitely
conceived
as
consisting
of
pleasures
or
thus
green
to
book
iii
chap
iv
says
it
is
the
realisation
of
those
objects
in
which
we
are
mainly
interested
the
succession
of
enjoyments
which
we
shall
experience
in
realising
that
forms
the
definite
content
of
our
idea
of
true
happiness
so
far
as
it
has
such
content
at
cf
also
it
is
more
remarkable
to
find
mill
chap
iv
declaring
that
money
no
less
than
power
or
fame
comes
by
association
of
ideas
to
be
a
part
of
happiness
an
ingredient
in
the
individual
s
conception
of
but
this
seems
to
be
a
mere
looseness
of
phraseology
venial
in
a
treatise
aiming
at
a
popular
style
since
mill
has
expressly
said
that
by
happiness
is
intended
pleasure
and
the
absence
of
pain
and
he
can
not
mean
that
money
is
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
fact
he
uses
in
the
same
passage
as
an
alternative
phrase
for
parts
of
happiness
the
phrases
sources
of
happiness
and
sources
of
pleasure
and
his
real
meaning
is
more
precisely
expressed
by
these
latter
terms
that
is
the
distinction
which
he
is
really
concerned
to
emphasise
is
that
between
the
state
of
mind
in
which
money
is
valued
solely
as
a
means
of
buying
other
things
and
the
state
of
mind
such
as
the
miser

in
which
the
mere
consciousness
of
possessing
it
gives
pleasure

from
any
idea
of
spending

intuitionism
i
have
used
the
term
intuitional
to
denote
the
view
of
ethics
which
regards
as
the
practically
ultimate
end
of
moral
actions
their
conformity
to
certain
rules
or
dictates
of
duty
unconditionally
prescribed
there
is
however
considerable
ambiguity
as
to
the
exact
antithesis
implied
by
the
terms
intuition
intuitive
and
their
congeners
as
currently
used
in
ethical
discussion
which
we
must
now
endeavour
to
remove
writers
who
maintain
that
we
have
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
rightness
of
actions
usually
mean
that
this
rightness
is
ascertained
by
simply
looking
at
the
actions
themselves
without
considering
their
ulterior
consequences
this
view
indeed
can
hardly
be
extended
to
the
whole
range
of
duty
since
no
morality
ever
existed
which
did
not
consider
ulterior
consequences
to
some
extent
prudence
or
forethought
has
commonly
been
reckoned
a
virtue
and
all
modern
lists
of
virtues
have
included
rational
benevolence
which
aims
at
the
happiness
of
other
human
beings
generally
and
therefore
necessarily
takes
into
consideration
even
remote
effects
of
actions
it
must
be
observed
too
that
it
is
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
an
act
and
its
consequences
as
the
effects
consequent
on
each
of
our
volitions
form
a
continuous
series
of
indefinite
extension
and
we
seem
to
be
conscious
of
causing
all
these
effects
so
far
as
at
the
moment
of
volition
we
foresee
them
to
be
probable
however
we
find
that
in
the
common
notions
of
different
kinds
of
actions
a
line
is
actually
drawn
between
the
results
included
in
the
notion
and
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
act
and
those
considered
as
its
consequences
for
example
in
speaking
truth
to
a
jury
i
may
possibly
foresee
that
my
words
operating
along
with
other
statements
and
indications
will
unavoidably
lead
them
to
a
wrong
conclusion
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused
as
certainly
as
i
foresee
that
they
will
produce
a
right
impression
as
to
the
particular
matter
of
fact
to
which
i
am
testifying
still
we
should
commonly
consider
the
latter
foresight
or
intention
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
act
as
an
act
of
veracity
while
the
former
merely
relates
to
a
consequence
we
must
understand
then
that
the
disregard
of
consequences
which
the
intuitional
view
is
here
taken
to
imply
only
relates
to
certain
determinate
classes
of
action
such
as
where
common
usage
of
terms
adequately
defines
what
events
are
to
be
included
in
the
general
notions
of
the
acts
and
what
regarded
as
their
consequences
but
again
we
have
to
observe
that
men
may
and
do
judge
remote
as
well
as
immediate
results
to
be
in
themselves
good
and
such
as
we
ought
to
seek
to
realise
without
considering
them
in
relation
to
the
feelings
of
sentient
beings
i
have
already
assumed
this
to
be
the
view
of
those
who
adopt
the
general
perfection
as
distinct
from
the
happiness
of
human
society
as
their
ultimate
end
and
it
would
seem
to
be
the
view
of
many
who
concentrate
their
efforts
on
some
more
particular
results
other
than
morality
such
as
the
promotion
of
art
or
knowledge
such
a
view
if
expressly
distinguished
from
hedonism
might
properly
be
classed
as
intuitional
but
in
a
sense
wider
than
that
defined
in
the
preceding
paragraph
it
would
be
meant
that
the
results
in
question
are
judged
to
be
good
and
not
by
inference
from
experience
of
the
pleasures
which
they
produce
we
have
therefore
to
admit
a
wider
use
of
intuition
as
equivalent
to
immediate
judgment
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
or
aimed
it
should
however
be
observed
that
the
current
contrast
between
intuitive
or
and
inductive
or
morality
commonly
involves
a
certain
confusion
of
thought
for
what
the
inductive
moralist
professes
to
know
by
induction
is
commonly
not
the
same
thing
as
what
the
intuitive
moralist
professes
to
know
by
intuition
in
the
former
case
it
is
the
conduciveness
to
pleasure
of
certain
kinds
of
action
that
is
methodically
ascertained
in
the
latter
case
their
rightness
there
is
therefore
no
proper
opposition
if
hedonism
claims
to
give
authoritative
guidance
this
can
only
be
in
virtue
of
the
principle
that
pleasure
is
the
only
reasonable
ultimate
end
of
human
action
and
this
principle
can
not
be
known
by
induction
from
experience
experience
can
at
most
tell
us
that
all
men
always
do
seek
pleasure
as
their
ultimate
end
that
it
does
not
support
this
conclusion
i
have
already
tried
to
show
it
can
not
tell
us
that
any
one
ought
so
to
seek
it
if
this
latter
proposition
is
legitimately
affirmed
in
respect
either
of
private
or
of
general
happiness
it
must
either
be
immediately
known
to
be
true
and
therefore
we
may
say
a
moral
intuition
or
be
inferred
ultimately
from
premises
which
include
at
least
one
such
moral
intuition
hence
either
species
of
hedonism
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
primarily
taken
in
this
treatise
might
be
legitimately
said
to
be
in
a
certain
sense
it
seems
however
to
be
the
prevailing
opinion
of
ordinary
moral
persons
and
of
most
of
the
writers
who
have
maintained
the
existence
of
moral
intuitions
that
certain
kinds
of
actions
are
unconditionally
prescribed
without
regard
to
ulterior
consequences
and
i
have
accordingly
treated
this
doctrine
as
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
intuitional
method
during
the
main
part
of
the
detailed
examination
of
that
method
which
i
attempt
in
book
iii
further
the
common
antithesis
between
intuitive
and
inductive
morality
is
misleading
in
another
way
since
a
moralist
may
hold
the
rightness
of
actions
to
be
cognisable
apart
from
the
pleasure
produced
by
them
while
yet
his
method
may
be
properly
called
inductive
for
he
may
hold
that
just
as
the
generalisations
of
physical
science
rest
on
particular
observations
so
in
ethics
general
truths
can
only
be
reached
by
induction
from
judgments
or
perceptions
relating
to
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
particular
acts
for
example
when
socrates
is
said
by
aristotle
to
have
applied
inductive
reasoning
to
ethical
questions
it
is
this
kind
of
induction
which
is
meant
he
discovered
as
we
are
told
the
latent
ignorance
of
himself
and
other
men
that
is
that
they
used
general
terms
confidently
without
being
able
when
called
upon
to
explain
the
meaning
of
those
terms
his
plan
for
remedying
this
ignorance
was
to
work
towards
the
true
definition
of
each
term
by
examining
and
comparing
different
instances
of
its
application
thus
the
definition
of
justice
would
be
sought
by
comparing
different
actions
commonly
judged
to
be
just
and
framing
a
general
proposition
that
would
harmonise
with
all
these
particular
judgments
so
again
in
the
popular
view
of
conscience
it
seems
to
be
often
implied
that
particular
judgments
are
the
most
trustworthy
conscience
is
the
accepted
popular
term
for
the
faculty
of
moral
judgment
as
applied
to
the
acts
and
motives
of
the
person
judging
and
we
most
commonly
think
of
the
dictates
of
conscience
as
relating
to
particular
actions
thus
when
a
man
is
bidden
in
any
particular
case
to
trust
to
his
conscience
it
commonly
seems
to
be
meant
that
he
should
exercise
a
faculty
of
judging
morally
this
particular
case
without
reference
to
general
rules
and
even
in
opposition
to
conclusions
obtained
by
systematic
deduction
from
such
rules
and
it
is
on
this
view
of
conscience
that
the
contempt
often
expressed
for
casuistry
may
be
most
easily
justified
for
if
the
particular
case
can
be
satisfactorily
settled
by
conscience
without
reference
to
general
rules
casuistry
which
consists
in
the
application
of
general
rules
to
particular
cases
is
at
best
superfluous
but
then
on
this
view
we
shall
have
no
practical
need
of
any
such
general
rules
or
of
scientific
ethics
at
all
we
may
of
course
form
general
propositions
by
induction
from
these
particular
conscientious
judgments
and
arrange
them
systematically
but
any
interest
which
such
a
system
may
have
will
be
purely
speculative
and
this
accounts
perhaps
for
the
indifference
or
hostility
to
systematic
morality
shown
by
some
conscientious
persons
for
they
feel
that
they
can
at
any
rate
do
without
it
and
they
fear
that
the
cultivation
of
it
may
place
the
mind
in
a
wrong
attitude
in
relation
to
practice
and
prove
rather
unfavourable
than
otherwise
to
the
proper
development
of
the
practically
important
faculty
manifested
or
exercised
in
particular
moral
judgments
the
view
above
described
may
be
called
in
a
sense
since
in
its
most
extreme
form
it
recognises
simple
immediate
intuitions
alone
and
discards
as
superfluous
all
modes
of
reasoning
to
moral
conclusions
and
we
may
find
in
it
one
phase
or
variety
of
the
intuitional
method
if
we
may
extend
the
term
method
to
include
a
procedure
that
is
completed
in
a
single
judgment
but
though
probably
all
moral
agents
have
experience
of
such
particular
intuitions
and
though
they
constitute
a
great
part
of
the
moral
phenomena
of
most
minds
comparatively
few
are
so
thoroughly
satisfied
with
them
as
not
to
feel
a
need
of
some
further
moral
knowledge
even
from
a
strictly
practical
point
of
view
for
these
particular
intuitions
do
not
to
reflective
persons
present
themselves
as
quite
indubitable
and
irrefragable
nor
do
they
always
find
when
they
have
put
an
ethical
question
to
themselves
with
all
sincerity
that
they
are
conscious
of
clear
immediate
insight
in
respect
of
it
again
when
a
man
compares
the
utterances
of
his
conscience
at
different
times
he
often
finds
it
difficult
to
make
them
altogether
consistent
the
same
conduct
will
wear
a
different
moral
aspect
at
one
time
from
that
which
it
wore
at
another
although
our
knowledge
of
its
circumstances
and
conditions
is
not
materially
changed
further
we
become
aware
that
the
moral
perceptions
of
different
minds
to
all
appearance
equally
competent
to
judge
frequently
conflict
one
condemns
what
another
approves
in
this
way
serious
doubts
are
aroused
as
to
the
validity
of
each
man
s
particular
moral
judgments
and
we
are
led
to
endeavour
to
set
these
doubts
at
rest
by
appealing
to
general
rules
more
firmly
established
on
a
basis
of
common
consent
and
in
fact
though
the
view
of
conscience
above
discussed
is
one
which
much
popular
language
seems
to
suggest
it
is
not
that
which
christian
and
other
moralists
have
usually
given
they
have
rather
represented
the
process
of
conscience
as
analogous
to
one
of
jural
reasoning
such
as
is
conducted
in
a
court
of
law
here
we
have
always
a
system
of
universal
rules
given
and
any
particular
action
has
to
be
brought
under
one
of
these
rules
before
it
can
be
pronounced
lawful
or
unlawful
now
the
rules
of
positive
law
are
usually
not
discoverable
by
the
individual
s
reason
this
may
teach
him
that
law
ought
to
be
obeyed
but
what
law
is
must
in
the
main
be
communicated
to
him
from
some
external
authority
and
this
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
with
the
conscientious
reasoning
of
ordinary
persons
when
any
dispute
or
difficulty
forces
them
to
reason
they
have
a
genuine
impulse
to
conform
to
the
right
rules
of
conduct
but
they
are
not
conscious
in
difficult
or
doubtful
cases
of
seeing
for
themselves
what
these
are
they
have
to
inquire
of
their
priest
or
their
sacred
books
or
perhaps
the
common
opinion
of
the
society
to
which
they
belong
in
so
far
as
this
is
the
case
we
can
not
strictly
call
their
method
intuitional
they
follow
rules
generally
received
not
intuitively
apprehended
other
persons
however
or
perhaps
all
to
some
extent
do
seem
to
see
for
themselves
the
truth
and
bindingness
of
all
or
most
of
these
current
rules
they
may
still
put
forward
common
consent
as
an
argument
for
the
validity
of
these
rules
but
only
as
supporting
the
individual
s
intuition
not
as
a
substitute
for
it
or
as
superseding
it
here
then
we
have
a
second
intuitional
method
of
which
the
fundamental
assumption
is
that
we
can
discern
certain
general
rules
with
really
clear
and
finally
valid
intuition
it
is
held
that
such
general
rules
are
implicit
in
the
moral
reasoning
of
ordinary
men
who
apprehend
them
adequately
for
most
practical
purposes
and
are
able
to
enunciate
them
roughly
but
that
to
state
them
with
proper
precision
requires
a
special
habit
of
contemplating
clearly
and
steadily
abstract
moral
notions
it
is
held
that
the
moralist
s
function
then
is
to
perform
this
process
of
abstract
contemplation
to
arrange
the
results
as
systematically
as
possible
and
by
proper
definitions
and
explanations
to
remove
vagueness
and
prevent
conflict
it
is
such
a
system
as
this
which
seems
to
be
generally
intended
when
intuitive
or
morality
is
mentioned
and
which
will
chiefly
occupy
us
in
book
iii
by
philosophic
minds
however
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
i
have
ventured
to
call
it
even
when
made
as
precise
and
orderly
as
possible
is
often
found
unsatisfactory
as
a
system
although
they
have
no
disposition
to
question
its
general
authority
it
is
found
difficult
to
accept
as
scientific
first
principles
the
moral
generalities
that
we
obtain
by
reflection
on
the
ordinary
thought
of
mankind
even
though
we
share
this
thought
even
granting
that
these
rules
can
be
so
defined
as
perfectly
to
fit
together
and
cover
the
whole
field
of
human
conduct
without
coming
into
conflict
and
without
leaving
any
practical
questions
unanswered
still
the
resulting
code
seems
an
accidental
aggregate
of
precepts
which
stands
in
need
of
some
rational
synthesis
in
short
without
being
disposed
to
deny
that
conduct
commonly
judged
to
be
right
is
so
we
may
yet
require
some
deeper
explanation
it
is
so
from
this
demand
springs
a
third
species
or
phase
of
intuitionism
which
while
accepting
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
in
the
main
sound
still
attempts
to
find
for
it
a
philosophic
basis
which
it
does
not
itself
offer
to
get
one
or
more
principles
more
absolutely
and
undeniably
true
and
evident
from
which
the
current
rules
might
be
deduced
either
just
as
they
are
commonly
received
or
with
slight
modifications
and
rectifications
the
three
phases
of
intuitionism
just
described
may
be
treated
as
three
stages
in
the
formal
development
of
intuitive
morality
we
may
term
them
respectively
perceptional
dogmatic
and
philosophical
the
i
have
only
defined
in
the
vaguest
way
in
fact
as
yet
i
have
presented
it
only
as
a
problem
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
how
many
solutions
may
be
attempted
but
it
does
not
seem
desirable
to
investigate
it
further
at
present
as
it
will
be
more
satisfactorily
studied
after
examining
in
detail
the
morality
of
common
sense
it
must
not
be
thought
that
these
three
phases
are
sharply
distinguished
in
the
moral
reasoning
of
ordinary
men
but
then
no
more
is
intuitionism
of
any
sort
sharply
distinguished
from
either
species
of
hedonism
a
loose
combination
or
confusion
of
methods
is
the
most
common
type
of
actual
moral
reasoning
probably
most
moral
men
believe
that
their
moral
sense
or
instinct
in
any
case
will
guide
them
fairly
right
but
also
that
there
are
general
rules
for
determining
right
action
in
different
departments
of
conduct
and
that
for
these
again
it
is
possible
to
find
a
philosophical
explanation
by
which
they
may
be
deduced
from
a
smaller
number
of
fundamental
principles
still
for
systematic
direction
of
conduct
we
require
to
know
on
what
judgments
we
are
to
rely
as
ultimately
valid
so
far
i
have
been
mainly
concerned
with
differences
in
intuitional
method
due
to
difference
of
generality
in
the
intuitive
beliefs
recognised
as
ultimately
valid
there
is
however
another
class
of
differences
arising
from
a
variation
of
view
as
to
the
precise
quality
immediately
apprehended
in
the
moral
intuition
these
are
peculiarly
subtle
and
difficult
to
fix
in
clear
and
precise
language
and
i
therefore
reserve
them
for
a
separate
chapter
intuitional
moralists
have
not
always
taken
sufficient
care
in
expounding
their
system
to
make
clear
whether
they
regard
as
ultimately
valid
moral
judgments
on
single
acts
or
general
rules
prescribing
particular
kinds
of
acts
or
more
universal
and
fundamental
principles
for
example
dugald
stewart
uses
the
term
perception
to
denote
the
immediate
operation
of
the
moral
faculty
at
the
same
time
in
describing
what
is
thus
perceived
he
always
seems
to
have
in
view
general
rules
still
we
can
tolerably
well
distinguish
among
english
ethical
writers
those
who
have
confined
themselves
mainly
to
the
definition
and
arrangement
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
from
those
who
have
aimed
at
a
more
philosophical
treatment
of
the
content
of
moral
intuition
and
we
find
that
the
distinction
corresponds
in
the
main
to
a
difference
of
periods
and
that
what
perhaps
we
should
hardly
have
expected
the
more
philosophical
school
is
the
earlier
the
explanation
of
this
may
be
partly
found
by
referring
to
the
doctrines
in
antagonism
to
which
in
the
respective
periods
the
intuitional
method
asserted
and
developed
itself
in
the
first
period
all
orthodox
moralists
were
occupied
in
refuting
hobbism
but
this
system
though
based
on
materialism
and
egoism
was
yet
intended
as
ethically
constructive
accepting
in
the
main
the
commonly
received
rules
of
social
morality
it
explained
them
as
the
conditions
of
peaceful
existence
which
enlightened
directed
each
individual
to
obey
provided
only
the
social
order
to
which
they
belonged
was
not
merely
ideal
but
made
actual
by
a
strong
government
now
no
doubt
this
view
renders
the
theoretical
basis
of
duty
seriously
unstable
still
assuming
a
decently
good
government
hobbism
may
claim
to
at
once
explain
and
establish
instead
of
undermining
the
morality
of
common
sense
and
therefore
though
some
of
hobbes
antagonists
as
cudworth
contented
themselves
with
simply
reaffirming
the
absoluteness
of
morality
the
more
thoughtful
felt
that
system
must
be
met
by
system
and
explanation
by
explanation
and
that
they
must
penetrate
beyond
the
dogmas
of
common
sense
to
some
more
irrefragable
certainty
and
so
while
cumberland
found
this
deeper
basis
in
the
notion
of
the
common
good
of
all
rationals
as
an
ultimate
end
clarke
sought
to
exhibit
the
more
fundamental
of
the
received
rules
as
axioms
of
perfect
necessarily
forced
upon
the
mind
in
contemplating
human
beings
and
their
relations
clarke
s
results
however
were
not
found
satisfactory
and
by
degrees
the
attempt
to
exhibit
morality
as
a
body
of
scientific
truth
fell
into
discredit
and
the
disposition
to
dwell
on
the
emotional
side
of
the
moral
consciousness
became
prevalent
but
when
ethical
discussion
thus
passed
over
into
psychological
analysis
and
classification
the
conception
of
the
objectivity
of
duty
on
which
the
authority
of
moral
sentiment
depends
fell
gradually
out
of
view
for
example
we
find
hutcheson
asking
why
the
moral
sense
should
not
vary
in
different
human
beings
as
the
palate
does
without
dreaming
that
there
is
any
peril
to
morality
in
admitting
such
variations
as
legitimate
when
however
the
new
doctrine
was
endorsed
by
the
dreaded
name
of
hume
its
dangerous
nature
and
the
need
of
bringing
again
into
prominence
the
cognitive
element
of
moral
consciousness
were
clearly
seen
and
this
work
was
undertaken
as
a
part
of
the
general
philosophic
protest
of
the
scottish
school
against
the
empiricism
that
had
culminated
in
hume
but
this
school
claimed
as
its
characteristic
merit
that
it
met
empiricism
on
its
own
ground
and
showed
among
the
facts
of
psychological
experience
which
the
empiricist
professed
to
observe
the
assumptions
which
he
repudiated
and
thus
in
ethics
it
was
led
rather
to
expound
and
reaffirm
the
morality
of
common
sense
than
to
offer
any
profounder
principles
which
could
not
be
so
easily
supported
by
an
appeal
to
common
experience

the
view
afterwards

in
which
the

valid

have
explained
in

it
must
however
be
remembered
that

the
quality
of
conduct
discerned
by
our
moral
faculty
as
rightness
which
is
the
term
commonly
used
by
english
moralists
we
have
regarded
this
term
and
its
equivalents
in
ordinary
use
as
implying
the
existence
of
a
dictate
or
imperative
of
reason
which
prescribes
certain
actions
either
unconditionally
or
with
reference
to
some
ulterior
end
it
is
however
possible
to
take
a
view
of
virtuous
action
in
which
though
the
validity
of
moral
intuitions
is
not
disputed
this
notion
of
rule
or
dictate
is
at
any
rate
only
latent
or
implicit
the
moral
ideal
being
presented
as
attractive
rather
than
imperative
such
a
view
seems
to
be
taken
when
the
action
to
which
we
are
morally
prompted
or
the
quality
of
character
manifested
in
it
is
judged
to
be
good
in
itself
and
not
merely
as
a
means
to
some
ulterior
good
this
as
was
before
noticed
was
the
fundamental
ethical
conception
in
the
greek
schools
of
moral
philosophy
generally
including
even
the
stoics
though
their
system
from
the
prominence
that
it
gives
to
the
conception
of
natural
law
forms
a
transitional
link
between
ancient
and
modern
ethics
and
this
historical
illustration
may
serve
to
exhibit
one
important
result
of
substituting
the
idea
of
goodness
for
that
of
rightness
of
conduct
which
at
first
sight
might
be
thought
a
merely
verbal
change
for
the
chief
characteristics
of
ancient
ethical
controversy
as
distinguished
from
modern
may
be
traced
to
the
employment
of
a
generic
notion
instead
of
a
specific
one
in
expressing
the
common
moral
judgments
on
actions
virtue
or
right
action
is
commonly
regarded
as
only
a
species
of
the
good
and
so
on
this
view
of
the
moral
intuition
the
first
question
that
offers
itself
when
we
endeavour
to
systematise
conduct
is
how
to
determine
the
relation
of
this
species
of
good
to
the
rest
of
the
genus
it
was
on
this
question
that
the
greek
thinkers
argued
from
first
to
last
their
speculations
can
scarcely
be
understood
by
us
unless
with
a
certain
effort
we
throw
the
notions
of
modern
ethics
aside
and
ask
as
they
did
not
what
is
duty
and
what
is
its
ground
but
which
of
the
objects
that
men
think
good
is
truly
good
or
the
highest
good
or
in
the
more
specialised
form
of
the
question
which
the
moral
intuition
introduces
what
is
the
relation
of
the
kind
of
good
we
call
virtue
the
qualities
of
conduct
and
character
which
men
commend
and
admire
to
other
good
things
this
then
is
the
first
difference
to
be
noticed
between
the
two
forms
of
the
intuitive
judgment
in
the
recognition
of
conduct
as
right
is
involved
an
authoritative
prescription
to
do
it
but
when
we
have
judged
conduct
to
be
good
it
is
not
yet
clear
that
we
ought
to
prefer
this
kind
of
good
to
all
other
good
things
some
standard
for
estimating
the
relative
values
of
different
goods
has
still
to
be
sought
i
propose
then
to
examine
the
import
of
the
notion
good
in
the
whole
range
of
its
application
premising
that
as
it
is
for
the
constituents
of
ultimate
good
that
we
require
a
standard
of
comparison
we
are
not
directly
concerned
with
anything
that
is
clearly
only
good
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
some
ulterior
end
if
indeed
we
had
only
this
latter
case
to
consider
it
would
be
plausible
to
interpret
good
without
reference
to
human
desire
or
choice
as
meaning
merely
fit
or
adapted
for
the
production
of
certain
effects
a
good
horse
for
riding
a
good
gun
for
shooting
etc
but
as
we
apply
the
notion
also
to
ultimate
ends
we
must
seek
a
meaning
for
it
which
will
cover
both
applications
there
is
however
a
simple
interpretation
of
the
term
which
is
widely
maintained
to
be
the
true
one
according
to
which
everything
which
we
judge
to
be
good
is
implicitly
conceived
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
pleasure
even
when
we
do
not
make
in
our
judgment
any
explicit
reference
to
this
or
any
other
ulterior
end
on
this
view
any
comparison
of
things
in
respect
of
their
goodness
would
seem
to
be
really
a
comparison
of
them
as
sources
of
pleasure
so
that
any
attempt
to
systematise
our
intuitions
of
goodness
whether
in
conduct
and
character
or
in
other
things
must
reasonably
lead
us
straight
to
hedonism
and
no
doubt
if
we
consider
the
application
of
the
term
outside
the
sphere
of
character
and
conduct
to
things
that
are
not
definitely
regarded
as
means
to
the
attainment
of
some
ulterior
object
of
desire
we
find
a
close
correspondence
between
our
apprehension
of
pleasure
derived
from
an
object
and
our
recognition
that
the
object
is
in
itself
the
good
things
of
life
are
things
which
give
pleasure
whether
sensual
or
emotional
as
good
dinners
wines
poems
pictures
music
and
this
gives
a
support
to
the
interpretation
of
good
as
equivalent
to
i
think
however
that
if
we
reflect
on
the
application
of
the
term
to
the
cases
most
analogous
to
that
of
conduct
to
what
we
may
call
objects
of
taste
we
shall
find
that
this
interpretation
of
it
has
not
clearly
the
support
of
common
sense
in
the
first
place
allowing
that
the
judgment
that
any
object
is
good
of
its
kind
is
closely
connected
with
the
apprehension
of
pleasure
derived
from
it
we
must
observe
that
it
is
generally
to
a
specific
kind
of
pleasure
that
the
affirmation
of
goodness
corresponds
and
that
if
the
object
happens
to
give
us
pleasure
of
a
different
kind
we
do
not
therefore
call
it
good
at
least
without
qualification
for
instance
we
should
not
call
a
wine
good
solely
because
it
was
very
wholesome
nor
a
poem
on
account
of
its
moral
lessons
and
hence
when
we
come
to
consider
the
meaning
of
the
term
good
as
applied
to
conduct
there
is
no
reason
so
far
to
suppose
that
it
has
any
reference
or
correspondence
to
the
pleasures
that
may
result
from
the
conduct
rather
the
perception
of
goodness
or
virtue
in
actions
would
seem
to
be
analogous
to
the
perception
of
beauty
in
material
things
which
is
normally
accompanied
with
a
specific
pleasure
which
we
call
æsthetic
but
has
often
no
discoverable
relation
to
the
general
usefulness
or
agreeableness
of
the
thing
discerned
to
be
beautiful
indeed
we
often
recognise
this
kind
of
excellence
in
things
hurtful
and
dangerous
but
further
as
regards
æsthetic
pleasures
and
the
sources
of
such
pleasures
that
we
commonly
judge
to
be
good
it
is
the
received
opinion
that
some
persons
have
more
and
others
less
good
taste
and
it
is
only
the
judgment
of
persons
of
good
taste
that
we
recognise
as
valid
in
respect
of
the
real
goodness
of
the
things
enjoyed
we
think
that
of
his
own
pleasure
each
individual
is
the
final
judge
and
there
is
no
appeal
from
his
decision
at
least
so
far
as
he
is
comparing
pleasures
within
his
actual
experience
but
the
affirmation
of
goodness
in
any
object
involves
the
assumption
of
a
universally
valid
standard
which
as
we
believe
the
judgment
of
persons
to
whom
we
attribute
good
taste
approximately
represents
and
it
seems
clear
that
the
term
good
as
applied
to
taste
does
not
mean
pleasant
it
merely
imports
the
conformity
of
the
æsthetic
judgment
so
characterised
to
the
supposed
ideal
deviation
from
which
implies
error
and
defect
nor
does
it
appear
to
be
always
the
person
of
best
taste
who
derives
the
greatest
enjoyment
from
any
kind
of
good
and
pleasant
things
we
are
familiar
with
the
fact
that
connoisseurs
of
wines
pictures
often
retain
their
intellectual
faculty
of
appraising
the
merits
of
the
objects
which
they
criticise
and
deciding
on
their
respective
places
in
the
scale
of
excellence
even
when
their
susceptibilities
to
pleasure
from
these
objects
are
comparatively
blunted
and
exhausted
and
more
generally
we
see
that
freshness
and
fulness
of
feeling
by
no
means
go
along
with
taste
and
judgment
and
that
a
person
who
possesses
the
former
may
derive
more
pleasure
from
inferior
objects
than
another
may
from
the
best
to
sum
up
the
general
admission
that
things
which
are
called
good
are
productive
of
pleasure
and
that
the
former
quality
is
inseparable
in
thought
from
the
latter
does
not
involve
the
inference
that
the
common
estimates
of
the
goodness
of
conduct
may
be
fairly
taken
as
estimates
of
the
amount
of
pleasure
resulting
from
it
for
analogy
would
lead
us
to
conclude
that
the
attribution
of
goodness
in
the
case
of
conduct
as
of
objects
of
taste
generally
may
correspond
not
to
all
the
pleasure
that
is
caused
by
the
conduct
but
to
a
specific
pleasure
in
this
case
the
contemplative
satisfaction
which
the
conduct
causes
to
a
disinterested
spectator
and
it
may
not
excite
even
this
specific
pleasure
generally
in
proportion
to
its
goodness
but
only
at
most
in
persons
of
good
moral
taste
and
even
in
their
case
we
can
distinguish
the
intellectual
apprehension
of
goodness
which
involves
the
conception
of
an
ideal
objective
standard
from
the
pleasurable
emotion
which
commonly
accompanies
it
and
may
suppose
the
latter
element
of
consciousness
diminished
almost
indefinitely
finally
when
we
pass
from
the
to
the
good
it
is
at
once
evident
that
this
latter
can
not
be
understood
as
equivalent
to
pleasure
or
happiness
by
any
persons
who
affirm
as
a
significant
proposition
and
not
as
a
mere
tautology
that
the
pleasure
or
happiness
of
human
beings
is
their
good
or
ultimate
good
such
affirmation
which
would
i
think
be
ordinarily
made
by
hedonists
obviously
implies
that
the
of
the
two
terms
is
different
however
closely
their
denotation
may
coincide
and
it
does
not
seem
that
any
fundamental
difference
of
meaning
is
implied
by
the
grammatical
variation
from
adjective
to
substantive
what
then
can
we
state
as
the
general
meaning
of
the
term
good
shall
we
say
with
hobbes
and
many
since
hobbes
that
whatsoever
is
the
object
of
any
man
s
desire
that
it
is
which
he
for
his
part
calleth
good
and
the
object
of
his
aversion
evil
to
simplify
the
discussion
we
will
consider
only
what
a
man
desires
for
itself
not
as
a
means
to
an
ulterior
result
and
for
himself
not
benevolently
for
others
his
own
good
and
ultimate
good
we
have
first
to
meet
the
obvious
objection
that
a
man
often
desires
what
he
knows
is
on
the
whole
bad
for
him
the
pleasure
of
drinking
champagne
which
is
sure
to
disagree
with
him
the
gratification
of
revenge
when
he
knows
that
his
true
interest
lies
in
reconciliation
the
answer
is
that
in
such
cases
the
desired
result
is
accompanied
or
followed
by
other
effects
which
when
they
come
excite
aversion
stronger
than
the
desire
for
the
desired
effect
but
that
these
bad
effects
though
are
not
the
representation
of
them
does
not
adequately
modify
the
predominant
direction
of
desire
as
a
present
fact
but
granting
this
and
fixing
attention
solely
on
the
result
desired
apart
from
its
concomitants
and
consequences
it
would
still
seem
that
what
is
desired
at
any
time
is
as
such
merely
apparent
good
which
may
not
be
found
good
when
fruition
comes
or
at
any
rate
not
so
good
as
it
appeared
it
may
turn
out
a
dead
sea
apple
mere
dust
and
ashes
in
the
eating
more
often
fruition
will
partly
correspond
to
expectation
but
may
still
fall
short
of
it
in
a
marked
degree
and
sometimes
even
while
yielding
to
the
desire
we
are
aware
of
the
illusoriness
of
this
expectation
of
good
which
the
desire
carries
with
it
i
conclude
therefore
that
if
we
are
to
conceive
of
the
elements
of
ultimate
good
as
capable
of
quantitative
comparison
as
we
do
when
we
speak
of
preferring
a
greater
good
to
a
lesser
we
can
not
identify
the
object
of
desire
with
good
simply
or
true
good
but
only
with
apparent
but
further
a
prudent
man
is
accustomed
to
suppress
with
more
or
less
success
desires
for
what
he
regards
as
out
of
his
power
to
attain
by
voluntary
action
as
fine
weather
perfect
health
great
wealth
or
fame
etc
but
any
success
he
may
have
in
diminishing
the
actual
intensity
of
such
desires
has
no
effect
in
leading
him
to
judge
the
objects
desired
less
it
would
seem
then
that
if
we
interpret
the
notion
good
in
relation
to
desire
we
must
identify
it
not
with
the
actually
but
rather
with
the
meaning
by
desirable
not
necessarily
what
to
be
desired
but
what
would
be
desired
with
strength
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
desirability
if
it
were
judged
attainable
by
voluntary
action
supposing
the
desirer
to
possess
a
perfect
forecast
emotional
as
well
as
intellectual
of
the
state
of
attainment
or
fruition
it
still
remains
possible
that
the
choice
of
any
particular
good
thus
defined
as
an
object
of
pursuit
may
be
on
the
whole
bad
on
account
of
its
concomitants
and
consequences
even
though
the
particular
result
when
attained
is
not
found
other
than
it
was
imagined
in
the
condition
of
previous
desire
if
therefore
in
seeking
a
definition
of
ultimate
good
we
mean
good
on
the
whole
we
have
following
the
line
of
thought
of
the
preceding
paragraph
to
express
its
relation
to
desire
differently
in
the
first
place
we
have
to
limit
our
view
to
desire
which
becomes
practical
in
volition
as
i
may
still
regard
as
desirable
results
which
i
judge
it
on
the
whole
imprudent
to
aim
at
but
even
with
this
limitation
the
relation
of
my
good
on
the
whole
to
my
desire
is
very
complicated
for
it
is
not
even
sufficient
to
say
that
my
good
on
the
whole
is
what
i
should
actually
desire
and
seek
if
all
the
consequences
of
seeking
it
could
be
foreknown
and
adequately
realised
by
me
in
imagination
at
the
time
of
making
my
choice
no
doubt
an
equal
regard
for
all
the
moments
of
our
conscious
experience
so
far
at
least
as
the
mere
difference
of
their
position
in
time
is
concerned
is
an
essential
characteristic
of
rational
conduct
but
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
does
not
afterwards
feel
for
the
consequences
of
an
action
aversion
strong
enough
to
cause
him
to
regret
it
can
not
be
accepted
as
a
complete
proof
that
he
has
acted
for
his
good
on
the
indeed
we
commonly
reckon
it
among
the
worst
consequences
of
some
kinds
of
conduct
that
they
alter
men
s
tendencies
to
desire
and
make
them
desire
their
lesser
good
more
than
their
greater
and
we
think
it
all
the
worse
for
a
man
even
in
this
world
if
he
is
never
roused
out
of
such
a
condition
and
lives
till
death
the
life
of
a
contented
pig
when
he
might
have
been
something
better
to
avoid
this
objection
it
would
have
to
be
said
that
a
man
s
future
good
on
the
whole
is
what
he
would
now
desire
and
seek
on
the
whole
if
all
the
consequences
of
all
the
different
lines
of
conduct
open
to
him
were
accurately
foreseen
and
adequately
realised
in
imagination
at
the
present
point
of
time
this
hypothetical
composition
of
impulsive
forces
involves
so
elaborate
and
complex
a
conception
that
it
is
somewhat
paradoxical
to
say
that
this
is
what
we
commonly
when
we
talk
of
a
man
s
good
on
the
still
i
can
not
deny
that
this
hypothetical
object
of
a
resultant
desire
supplies
an
intelligible
and
admissible
interpretation
of
the
terms
good
substantive
and
desirable
as
giving
philosophical
precision
to
the
vaguer
meaning
with
which
they
are
used
in
ordinary
discourse
and
it
would
seem
that
a
calm
comprehensive
desire
for
good
conceived
somewhat
in
this
way
though
more
vaguely
is
normally
produced
by
intellectual
comparison
and
experience
in
a
reflective
mind
the
notion
of
good
thus
attained
has
an
ideal
element
it
is
something
that
not
always
actually
desired
and
aimed
at
by
human
beings
but
the
ideal
element
is
entirely
interpretable
in
terms
of
actual
or
hypothetical
and
does
not
introduce
any
judgment
of
value
fundamentally
distinct
from
judgments
relating
to
existence
still
less
any
dictate
of
it
seems
to
me
however
more
in
accordance
with
common
sense
to
recognise
as
butler
does
that
the
calm
desire
for
my
good
on
the
whole
is
and
therefore
carries
with
it
implicitly
a
rational
dictate
to
aim
at
this
end
if
in
any
case
a
conflicting
desire
urges
the
will
in
an
opposite
direction
still
we
may
keep
the
notion
of
dictate
or
imperative
merely
implicit
and
latent
as
it
seems
to
be
in
ordinary
judgments
as
to
my
good
and
its
opposite
by
interpreting
ultimate
good
on
the
whole
for
me
to
mean
what
i
should
practically
desire
if
my
desires
were
in
harmony
with
reason
assuming
my
own
existence
alone
to
be
considered
on
this
view
ultimate
good
on
the
whole
unqualified
by
reference
to
a
particular
subject
must
be
taken
to
mean
what
as
a
rational
being
i
should
desire
and
seek
to
realise
assuming
myself
to
have
an
equal
concern
for
existence
when
conduct
is
judged
to
be
good
or
desirable
in
itself
independently
of
its
consequences
it
is
i
conceive
this
latter
point
of
view
that
is
taken
such
a
judgment
differs
as
i
have
said
from
the
judgment
that
conduct
is
right
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
involve
a
definite
precept
to
perform
it
since
it
still
leaves
it
an
open
question
whether
this
particular
kind
of
good
is
the
greatest
good
that
we
can
under
the
circumstances
obtain
it
differs
further
as
we
may
now
observe
in
so
far
as
good
or
excellent
actions
are
not
implied
to
be
in
our
power
in
the
same
strict
sense
as
right
actions
any
more
than
any
other
good
things
and
in
fact
there
are
many
excellences
of
behaviour
which
we
can
not
attain
by
any
effort
of
will
at
least
directly
and
at
the
moment
hence
we
often
feel
that
the
recognition
of
goodness
in
the
conduct
of
others
does
not
carry
with
it
a
clear
precept
to
do
likewise
but
rather
the
vague
desire
that
stirs
an
imitative
will
in
so
far
as
this
is
the
case
goodness
of
conduct
becomes
an
ulterior
end
the
attainment
of
which
lies
outside
and
beyond
the
range
of
immediate
volition
it
remains
to
consider
by
what
standard
the
value
of
conduct
or
character
thus
intuitively
judged
to
be
good
in
itself
is
to
be
and
compared
with
that
of
other
good
things
i
shall
not
now
attempt
to
establish
such
a
standard
but
a
little
reflection
may
enable
us
to
limit
considerably
the
range
of
comparison
for
which
it
is
required
for
i
think
that
if
we
consider
carefully
such
permanent
results
as
are
commonly
judged
to
be
good
other
than
qualities
of
human
beings
we
can
find
nothing
that
on
reflection
appears
to
possess
this
quality
of
goodness
out
of
relation
to
human
existence
or
at
least
to
some
consciousness
or
feeling
for
example
we
commonly
judge
some
inanimate
objects
scenes
etc
to
be
good
as
possessing
beauty
and
others
bad
from
ugliness
still
no
one
would
consider
it
rational
to
aim
at
the
production
of
beauty
in
external
nature
apart
from
any
possible
contemplation
of
it
by
human
beings
in
fact
when
beauty
is
maintained
to
be
objective
it
is
not
commonly
meant
that
it
exists
as
beauty
out
of
relation
to
any
mind
whatsoever
but
only
that
there
is
some
standard
of
beauty
valid
for
all
minds
it
may
however
be
said
that
beauty
and
other
results
commonly
judged
to
be
good
though
we
do
not
conceive
them
to
exist
out
of
relation
to
human
beings
or
at
least
minds
of
some
kind
are
yet
so
far
separable
as
ends
from
the
human
beings
on
whom
their
existence
depends
that
their
realisation
may
conceivably
come
into
competition
with
the
perfection
or
happiness
of
these
beings
thus
though
beautiful
things
can
not
be
thought
worth
producing
except
as
possible
objects
of
contemplation
still
a
man
may
devote
himself
to
their
production
without
any
consideration
of
the
persons
who
are
to
contemplate
them
similarly
knowledge
is
a
good
which
can
not
exist
except
in
minds
and
yet
one
may
be
more
interested
in
the
development
of
knowledge
than
in
its
possession
by
any
particular
minds
and
may
take
the
former
as
an
ultimate
end
without
regarding
the
latter
still
as
soon
as
the
alternatives
are
clearly
apprehended
it
will
i
think
be
generally
held
that
beauty
knowledge
and
other
ideal
goods
as
well
as
all
external
material
things
are
only
reasonably
to
be
sought
by
men
in
so
far
as
they
conduce
either
to
happiness
or
to
the
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
existence
i
say
human
for
though
most
utilitarians
consider
the
pleasure
and
freedom
from
pain
of
the
inferior
animals
to
be
included
in
the
happiness
which
they
take
as
the
right
and
proper
end
of
conduct
no
one
seems
to
contend
that
we
ought
to
aim
at
perfecting
brutes
except
as
a
means
to
our
ends
or
at
least
as
objects
of
scientific
or
æsthetic
contemplation
for
us
nor
again
can
we
include
as
a
practical
end
the
existence
of
beings
above
the
human
we
certainly
apply
the
idea
of
good
to
the
divine
existence
just
as
we
do
to
his
work
and
indeed
in
a
manner
and
when
it
is
said
that
we
should
do
all
things
to
the
glory
of
god
it
may
seem
to
be
implied
that
the
existence
of
god
is
made
better
by
our
glorifying
him
still
this
inference
when
explicitly
drawn
appears
somewhat
impious
and
theologians
generally
recoil
from
it
and
refrain
from
using
the
notion
of
a
possible
addition
to
the
goodness
of
the
divine
existence
as
a
ground
of
human
duty
nor
can
the
influence
of
our
actions
on
other
intelligences
besides
the
divine
be
at
present
made
matter
of
scientific
discussion
i
shall
therefore
confidently
lay
down
that
if
there
be
any
good
other
than
happiness
to
be
sought
by
man
as
an
ultimate
practical
end
it
can
only
be
the
goodness
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
existence
how
far
this
notion
includes
more
than
virtue
what
its
precise
relation
to
pleasure
is
and
to
what
method
we
shall
be
logically
led
if
we
accept
it
as
fundamental
are
questions
which
we
shall
more
conveniently
discuss
after
the
detailed
examination
of
these
two
other
notions
pleasure
and
virtue
in
which
we
shall
be
engaged
in
the
two
following
books
footnotes
it
is
however
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
ideas
of
and
as
applied
to
human
actions
although
there
is
much
affinity
between
them
and
they
have
frequently
been
identified
especially
by
the
greek
thinkers
no
doubt
both
the
ideas
themselves
and
the
corresponding
pleasurable
emotions
arising
on
the
contemplation
of
conduct
are
often
indistinguishable
a
noble
action
affects
us
like
a
scene
a
picture
or
a
strain
of
music
and
the
delineation
of
human
virtue
is
an
important
part
of
the
means
which
the
artist
has
at
his
disposal
for
producing
his
peculiar
effects
still
on
looking
closer
we
see
not
only
that
there
is
much
good
conduct
which
is
not
beautiful
or
at
least
does
not
sensibly
impress
us
as
such
but
even
that
certain
kinds
of
crime
and
wickedness
have
a
splendour
and
sublimity
of
their
own
for
example
such
a
career
as
cæsar
borgia
s
as
renan
says
is
beau
comme
une
tempête
comme
un
it
is
true
i
think
that
in
all
such
cases
the
beauty
depends
upon
the
exhibition
in
the
criminal
s
conduct
of
striking
gifts
and
excellences
mingled
with
the
wickedness
but
it
does
not
seem
that
we
can
abstract
the
latter
without
impairing
the
æsthetic
effect
and
hence
i
conceive
we
have
to
distinguish
the
sense
of
beauty
in
conduct
from
the
sense
of
moral
goodness
it
would
seem
that
according
to
the
common
view
of
good
there
are
occasions
in
which
an
individual
s
sacrifice
of
his
own
good
on
the
whole
according
to
the
most
rational
conception
of
it
that
he
can
form
would
apparently
realise
greater
good
for
others
whether
indeed
such
a
sacrifice
is
ever
really
required
and
whether
if
so
it
is
truly
reasonable
for
the
individual
to
sacrifice
his
own
good
on
the
whole
are
among
the
profoundest
questions
of
ethics
and
i
shall
carefully
consider
them
in
subsequent
chapters
especially
book
iii
chap
i
here
only
desire
to
avoid
any
prejudgment
of
these
questions
in
my
definition
of
my
own
as
before
said
chap
iii
so
far
as
my
good
on
the
whole
is
adopted
as
an
end
of
action
the
notion
of
ought
implying
a
dictate
or
imperative
of
reason
becomes
applicable
to
the
necessary
or
fittest
means
to
the
attainment
of
the
adopted
end
character
is
only
known
to
us
through
its
manifestation
in
conduct
and
i
conceive
that
in
our
common
recognition
of
virtue
as
having
value
in
itself
we
do
not
ordinarily
distinguish
character
from
conduct
we
do
not
raise
the
question
whether
character
is
to
be
valued
for
the
sake
of
the
conduct
in
which
it
is
manifested
or
conduct
for
the
sake
of
the
character
that
it
exhibits
and
develops
how
this
question
should
be
answered
when
it
is
raised
will
be
more
conveniently
considered
at
a
later
stage
of
the
discussion
see
book
iii
chap
ii
and
chap
xiv
no
doubt
there
is
a
point
of
view
sometimes
adopted
with
great
earnestness
from
which
the
whole
universe
and
not
merely
a
certain
condition
of
rational
or
sentient
beings
is
contemplated
as
very
good
just
as
the
creator
in
genesis
is
described
as
contemplating
it
but
such
a
view
can
scarcely
be
developed
into
a
method
of
ethics
for
practical
purposes
we
require
to
conceive
some
parts
of
the
universe
as
at
least
less
good
than
they
might
be
and
we
do
not
seem
to
have
any
ground
for
drawing
such
a
distinction
between
different
portions
of
the
universe
considered
in
themselves
and
out
of
relation
to
conscious
or
sentient
beings
book
ii
egoistic
hedonism
chapter
i
the
principle
and
method
of
egoism
the
object
of
the
present
book
is
to
examine
the
method
of
determining
reasonable
conduct
which
has
been
already
defined
in
outline
under
the
name
of
egoism
taking
this
term
as
equivalent
to
egoistic
hedonism
and
as
implying
the
adoption
of
his
own
greatest
happiness
as
the
ultimate
end
of
each
individual
s
actions
it
may
be
doubted
whether
this
ought
to
be
included
among
received
methods
of
since
there
are
strong
grounds
for
holding
that
a
system
of
morality
satisfactory
to
the
moral
consciousness
of
mankind
in
general
can
not
be
constructed
on
the
basis
of
simple
egoism
in
subsequent
chapters
i
shall
carefully
discuss
these
reasons
at
present
it
seems
sufficient
to
point
to
the
wide
acceptance
of
the
principle
that
it
is
reasonable
for
a
man
to
act
in
the
manner
most
conducive
to
his
own
happiness
we
find
it
expressly
admitted
by
leading
representatives
both
of
intuitionism
and
of
that
universalistic
hedonism
to
which
i
propose
to
restrict
the
name
of
utilitarianism
i
have
already
noticed
that
bentham
although
he
puts
forward
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
as
the
true
standard
of
right
and
wrong
yet
regards
it
as
right
and
proper
that
each
individual
should
aim
at
his
own
greatest
happiness
and
butler
is
equally
prepared
to
grant
that
our
ideas
of
happiness
and
misery
are
of
all
our
ideas
the
nearest
and
most
important
to
us
that
though
virtue
or
moral
rectitude
does
indeed
consist
in
affection
to
and
pursuit
of
what
is
right
and
good
as
such
yet
when
we
sit
down
in
a
cool
hour
we
can
neither
justify
to
ourselves
this
or
any
other
pursuit
till
we
are
convinced
that
it
will
be
for
our
happiness
or
at
least
not
contrary
to
and
even
clarke
notwithstanding
the
emphatic
terms
in
which
he
has
maintained
that
virtue
truly
deserves
to
be
chosen
for
its
own
sake
and
vice
to
be
avoided
yet
admits
that
it
is
not
truly
reasonable
that
men
by
adhering
to
virtue
should
part
with
their
lives
if
thereby
they
eternally
deprived
themselves
of
all
possibility
of
receiving
any
advantage
from
that
and
generally
in
the
ages
of
christian
faith
it
has
been
obvious
and
natural
to
hold
that
the
realisation
of
virtue
is
essentially
an
enlightened
and
pursuit
of
happiness
for
the
agent
nor
has
this
doctrine
been
held
only
by
persons
of
a
cold
and
calculating
turn
of
mind
we
find
it
urged
with
emphasis
by
so
chivalrous
and
a
preacher
as
bishop
berkeley
no
doubt
this
is
only
one
side
or
element
of
the
christian
view
the
opposite
doctrine
that
an
action
done
from
motives
of
is
not
properly
virtuous
has
continually
asserted
itself
as
either
openly
conflicting
or
in
some
manner
reconciled
with
the
former
still
the
former
though
less
refined
and
elevated
seems
to
have
been
the
commoner
view
indeed
it
is
hardly
going
too
far
to
say
that
common
sense
assumes
that
interested
actions
tending
to
promote
the
agent
s
happiness
are
reasonable
and
that
the
lies
with
those
who
maintain
that
disinterested
conduct
as
such
is
reasonable
but
as
has
been
before
said
in
the
common
notions
of
interest
happiness
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
vagueness
and
ambiguity
so
that
in
order
to
fit
these
terms
for
the
purposes
of
scientific
discussion
we
must
while
retaining
the
main
part
of
their
signification
endeavour
to
make
it
more
precise
in
my
judgment
this
result
is
attained
if
by
greatest
possible
happiness
we
understand
the
greatest
attainable
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
the
two
terms
being
used
with
equally
comprehensive
meanings
to
include
respectively
all
kinds
of
agreeable
and
disagreeable
feelings
further
if
this
quantitative
definition
of
the
end
be
accepted
consistency
requires
that
pleasures
should
be
sought
in
proportion
to
their
pleasantness
and
therefore
the
less
pleasant
consciousness
must
not
be
preferred
to
the
more
pleasant
on
the
ground
of
any
other
qualities
that
it
may
possess
the
distinctions
of
that
mill
and
others
urge
may
still
be
admitted
as
grounds
of
preference
but
only
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
resolved
into
distinctions
of
quantity
this
is
the
type
to
which
the
practical
reasoning
that
is
commonly
called
egoistic
tends
to
conform
when
we
rigorously
exclude
all
ambiguities
and
inconsistencies
and
it
is
only
in
this
more
precise
form
that
it
seems
worth
while
to
subject
such
reasoning
to
a
detailed
examination
we
must
therefore
understand
by
an
egoist
a
man
who
when
two
or
more
courses
of
action
are
open
to
him
ascertains
as
accurately
as
he
can
the
amounts
of
pleasure
and
pain
that
are
likely
to
result
from
each
and
chooses
the
one
which
he
thinks
will
yield
him
the
greatest
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
it
must
however
be
pointed
out
that
the
adoption
of
the
fundamental
of
egoism
as
just
explained
by
no
means
necessarily
implies
the
ordinary
empirical
method
of
seeking
one
s
own
pleasure
or
happiness
a
man
may
aim
at
the
greatest
happiness
within
his
reach
and
yet
not
attempt
to
ascertain
empirically
what
amount
of
pleasure
and
pain
is
likely
to
attend
any
given
course
of
action
believing
that
he
has
some
surer
deductive
method
for
determining
the
conduct
which
will
make
him
most
happy
in
the
he
may
believe
this
on
grounds
of
positive
religion
because
god
has
promised
happiness
as
a
reward
for
obedience
to
certain
definite
commands
or
on
grounds
of
natural
religion
because
god
being
just
and
benevolent
must
have
so
ordered
the
world
that
happiness
will
in
the
be
distributed
in
proportion
to
virtue
it
is
by
a
combination
of
both
these
arguments
that
paley
connects
the
universalistic
hedonism
that
he
adopts
as
a
method
for
determining
duties
with
the
egoism
which
seems
to
him
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
rational
conduct
or
again
a
man
may
connect
virtue
with
happiness
by
a
process
of
reasoning
purely
ethical
as
aristotle
seems
to
do
by
the
assumption
that
the
best
activity
will
be
always
attended
by
the
greatest
pleasure
as
its
inseparable
concomitant
best
being
determined
by
a
reference
to
moral
intuition
or
to
the
common
moral
opinions
of
men
generally
or
of
and
men
or
the
deduction
by
which
maximum
pleasure
is
inferred
to
be
the
result
of
a
particular
kind
of
action
may
be
psychological
or
physiological
we
may
have
some
general
theory
as
to
the
connexion
of
pleasure
with
some
other
physical
or
psychical
fact
according
to
which
we
can
deduce
the
amount
of
pleasure
that
will
attend
any
particular
kind
of
behaviour
as
it
is
widely
held
that
a
perfectly
healthy
and
harmonious
exercise
of
our
different
bodily
and
mental
functions
is
the
course
of
life
most
conducive
to
pleasure
in
the
in
this
latter
case
though
accepting
unreservedly
the
hedonistic
principle
we
shall
not
be
called
upon
to
estimate
and
compare
particular
pleasures
but
rather
to
define
the
notions
of
perfect
health
and
harmony
of
functions
and
consider
how
these
ends
may
be
attained
still
those
who
advocate
such
deductive
methods
commonly
appeal
to
ordinary
experience
at
least
as
supplying
confirmation
or
verification
and
admit
that
the
pleasantness
and
painfulness
of
pleasures
and
pains
are
only
directly
known
to
the
individual
who
experiences
them
it
would
seem
therefore
that
at
any
rate
the
obvious
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
is
that
which
we
may
call
and
it
is
this
i
conceive
that
is
commonly
used
in
egoistic
deliberation
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
examine
this
method
in
the
first
instance
to
ascertain
clearly
the
assumptions
which
it
involves
and
estimate
the
exactness
of
its
results

empirical
hedonism
the
first
and
most
fundamental
assumption
involved
not
only
in
the
empirical
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
but
in
the
very
conception
of
greatest
happiness
as
an
end
of
action
is
the
commensurability
of
pleasures
and
pains
by
this
i
mean
that
we
must
assume
the
pleasures
sought
and
the
pains
shunned
to
have
determinate
quantitative
relations
to
each
other
for
otherwise
they
can
not
be
conceived
as
possible
elements
of
a
total
which
we
are
to
seek
to
make
as
great
as
possible
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
exclude
the
supposition
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
pleasure
so
much
more
pleasant
than
others
that
the
smallest
conceivable
amount
of
the
former
would
outweigh
the
greatest
conceivable
amount
of
the
latter
since
if
this
were
ascertained
to
be
the
case
the
only
result
would
be
that
any
hedonistic
calculation
involving
pleasures
of
the
former
class
might
be
simplified
by
treating
those
of
the
latter
class
as
practically
i
think
however
that
in
all
ordinary
prudential
reasoning
at
any
rate
the
assumption
is
implicitly
made
that
all
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
man
can
experience
bear
a
finite
ratio
to
each
other
in
respect
of
pleasantness
and
its
opposite
so
far
as
this
ratio
can
be
made
definite
the
intensity
of
a
pleasure
or
pain
can
be
balanced
against
its
duration
for
if
we
conceive
one
pleasure
or
pain
finite
in
duration
to
be
intensively
greater
than
another
in
some
definite
ratio
it
seems
to
be
implied
in
this
conception
that
the
latter
if
continuously
increased
in
extent
without
change
in
its
intensity
would
at
a
certain
point
just
balance
the
former
in
amount
if
pleasures
then
can
be
arranged
in
a
scale
as
greater
or
less
in
some
finite
degree
we
are
led
to
the
assumption
of
a
hedonistic
zero
or
perfectly
neutral
feeling
as
a
point
from
which
the
positive
quantity
of
pleasures
may
be
measured
and
this
latter
assumption
emerges
still
more
clearly
when
we
consider
the
comparison
and
balancing
of
pleasures
with
pains
which
hedonism
necessarily
involves
for
pain
must
be
reckoned
as
the
negative
quantity
of
pleasure
to
be
balanced
against
and
subtracted
from
the
positive
in
estimating
happiness
on
the
whole
we
must
therefore
conceive
as
at
least
ideally
possible
a
point
of
transition
in
consciousness
at
which
we
pass
from
the
positive
to
the
negative
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
assume
that
this
strictly
indifferent
or
neutral
feeling
ever
actually
occurs
still
experience
seems
to
show
that
a
state
at
any
rate
very
nearly
approximating
to
it
is
even
common
and
we
certainly
experience
continual
transitions
from
pleasure
to
pain
and
and
thus
unless
we
conceive
all
such
transitions
to
be
abrupt
we
must
exist
at
least
momentarily
in
this
neutral
state
in
what
i
have
just
said
i
have
by
implication
denied
the
paradox
of
epicurus
that
the
state
of
painlessness
is
equivalent
to
the
highest
possible
pleasure
so
that
if
we
can
obtain
absolute
freedom
from
pain
the
goal
of
hedonism
is
reached
after
which
we
may
vary
but
can
not
increase
our
pleasure
this
doctrine
is
opposed
to
common
sense
and
common
experience
but
it
would
i
think
be
equally
erroneous
on
the
other
hand
to
regard
this
neutral
feeling
hedonistic
zero
as
i
have
called
it
as
the
normal
condition
of
our
consciousness
out
of
which
we
occasionally
sink
into
pain
and
occasionally
rise
into
pleasure
nature
has
not
been
so
niggardly
to
man
as
this
so
long
as
health
is
retained
and
pain
and
irksome
toil
banished
the
mere
performance
of
the
ordinary
habitual
functions
of
life
is
according
to
my
experience
a
frequent
source
of
moderate
pleasures
alternating
rapidly
with
states
nearly
or
quite
indifferent
thus
we
may
venture
to
say
that
the
apathy
which
so
large
a
proportion
of
greek
moralists
in
the
period
regarded
as
the
ideal
state
of
existence
was
not
really
conceived
by
them
as
without
one
pleasure
and
without
one
pain
but
rather
as
a
state
of
placid
intellectual
contemplation
which
in
philosophic
minds
might
easily
reach
a
high
degree
of
pleasure
we
have
yet
to
give
to
the
notions
of
pleasure
and
pain
the
precision
required
for
quantitative
comparison
in
dealing
with
this
point
and
in
the
rest
of
the
hedonistic
discussion
it
will
be
convenient
for
the
most
part
to
speak
of
pleasure
only
assuming
that
pain
may
be
regarded
as
the
negative
quantity
of
pleasure
and
that
accordingly
any
statements
made
with
respect
to
pleasure
may
be
at
once
applied
by
obvious
changes
of
phrase
to
pain
the
equivalent
phrase
for
pleasure
according
to
spencer
is
a
feeling
which
we
seek
to
bring
into
consciousness
and
retain
there
and
similarly
bain
says
that
pleasure
and
pain
in
the
actual
or
real
experience
are
to
be
held
as
identical
with
motive
but
granting
that
pleasures
normally
excite
desire
it
still
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
judge
pleasures
to
be
greater
and
less
exactly
in
proportion
as
they
stimulate
the
will
to
actions
tending
to
sustain
them
of
course
neither
bain
nor
spencer
must
be
understood
to
lay
down
that
all
pleasures
when
actually
felt
actually
stimulate
to
exertion
of
some
kind
since
this
is
obviously
not
true
of
the
pleasures
of
repose
a
warm
bath
etc
the
stimulus
must
in
such
cases
be
understood
to
be
latent
and
potential
only
becoming
actual
when
action
is
required
to
prevent
the
cessation
or
diminution
of
the
pleasure
thus
a
man
enjoying
rest
after
fatigue
is
vaguely
conscious
of
a
strong
clinging
to
his
actual
condition
and
of
a
latent
readiness
to
resist
any
impulse
to
change
it
further
the
stimulus
of
moderate
pleasures
and
pains
may
become
unfelt
through
habitual
repression
for
instance
in
a
habitually
temperate
man
the
stimulus
to
prolong
the
pleasure
of
eating
or
drinking
usually
ceases
before
the
pleasure
ceases
it
is
only
occasionally
that
he
feels
the
need
of
controlling
an
impulse
to
eat
or
drink
up
to
the
point
of
satiety
so
again
a
protracted
pain
of
moderate
intensity
and
free
from
alarm
such
as
a
dull
prolonged
toothache
seems
sometimes
to
lose
its
felt
stimulus
to
action
without
losing
its
character
as
pain
here
again
the
stimulus
may
be
properly
conceived
as
latent
since
if
asked
whether
we
should
like
to
get
rid
of
even
a
mild
toothache
we
should
certainly
answer
yes
but
even
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
cases
where
the
stimulus
is
palpable
and
strong
bain
s
identification
of
pleasure
and
pain
with
motive
power
does
not
appear
to
me
to
accord
exactly
with
our
common
empirical
judgments
he
himself
contrasts
the
disproportionate
strain
of
active
powers
in
one
direction
to
which
any
sudden
and
great
delight
may
give
rise
with
the
proper
frame
of
mind
under
delight
which
is
to
inspire
no
endeavours
except
what
the
charm
of
the
moment
and
he
elsewhere
explains
that
our
pleasurable
emotions
are
all
liable
to
detain
the
mind
unduly
through
the
atmosphere
of
excitement
with
which
they
are
surrounded
carrying
the
mind
beyond
the
estimate
of
pleasure
and
pain
to
the
state
named
passion
in
which
a
man
is
not
moved
solely
by
the
strict
value
of
the
pleasure
but
also
by
the
engrossing
power
of
the
it
is
true
that
in
such
cases
bain
seems
to
hold
that
these
disturbances
and
anomalies
of
the
will
begin
to
tell
in
the
actual
feeling
but
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
exciting
pleasures
are
liable
to
exercise
even
when
actually
felt
a
volitional
stimulus
out
of
proportion
to
their
intensity
as
pleasures
and
bain
himself
seems
to
recognise
this
in
a
passage
where
he
says
that
acute
pleasures
and
pains
stimulate
the
will
perhaps
more
strongly
than
an
equivalent
stimulation
of
the
massive
i
also
find
that
some
feelings
which
stimulate
strongly
to
their
own
removal
are
either
not
painful
at
all
or
only
slightly
painful
ordinarily
the
sensation
of
being
tickled
if
this
be
so
it
is
obviously
inexact
to
define
pleasure
purposes
of
as
the
kind
of
feeling
that
we
seek
to
retain
in
consciousness
shall
we
then
say
that
there
is
a
measurable
quality
of
feeling
expressed
by
the
word
pleasure
which
is
independent
of
its
relation
to
volition
and
strictly
undefinable
from
its
simplicity
like
the
quality
of
feeling
expressed
by
sweet
of
which
also
we
are
conscious
in
varying
degrees
of
intensity
this
seems
to
be
the
view
of
some
writers
but
for
my
own
part
when
i
reflect
on
the
notion
of
pleasure
using
the
term
in
the
comprehensive
sense
which
i
have
adopted
to
include
the
most
refined
and
subtle
intellectual
and
emotional
gratifications
no
less
than
the
coarser
and
more
definite
sensual
enjoyments
the
only
common
quality
that
i
can
find
in
the
feelings
so
designated
seems
to
be
that
relation
to
desire
and
volition
expressed
by
the
general
term
desirable
in
the
sense
previously
explained
i
propose
therefore
to
define
pleasure
when
we
are
considering
its
strict
value
for
purposes
of
quantitative
comparison
as
a
feeling
which
when
experienced
by
intelligent
beings
is
at
least
implicitly
apprehended
as
desirable
or
in
cases
of
comparison
preferable
here
however
a
new
question
comes
into
view
when
i
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
as
a
fundamental
assumption
of
hedonism
that
it
is
reasonable
to
prefer
pleasures
in
proportion
to
their
intensity
and
not
to
allow
this
ground
of
preference
to
be
outweighed
by
any
merely
qualitative
difference
i
implied
that
the
preference
of
pleasures
on
grounds
of
quality
as
opposed
to
quantity
as
higher
or
nobler
is
actually
possible
and
indeed
such
preference
is
commonly
thought
to
be
of
frequent
occurrence
but
if
we
take
the
definition
of
pleasure
just
given
that
it
is
the
kind
of
feeling
which
we
apprehend
to
be
desirable
or
preferable
it
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
that
the
less
pleasant
feeling
can
ever
be
thought
preferable
to
the
more
pleasant
this
contradiction
may
be
avoided
as
follows
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
the
pleasantness
of
a
feeling
is
only
directly
cognisable
by
the
individual
who
feels
it
at
the
time
of
feeling
it
thus
though
as
i
shall
presently
argue
in
so
far
as
any
estimate
of
pleasantness
involves
comparison
with
feelings
only
represented
in
idea
it
is
liable
to
be
erroneous
through
imperfections
in
the
representation
still
no
one
is
in
a
position
to
controvert
the
preference
of
the
sentient
individual
so
far
as
the
quality
of
the
present
feeling
alone
is
concerned
when
however
we
judge
of
the
preferable
quality
as
elevation
or
refinement
of
a
state
of
consciousness
as
distinct
from
its
pleasantness
we
seem
to
appeal
to
some
common
standard
which
others
can
apply
as
well
as
the
sentient
individual
hence
i
should
conclude
that
when
one
kind
of
pleasure
is
judged
to
be
qualitatively
superior
to
another
although
less
pleasant
it
is
not
really
the
feeling
itself
that
is
preferred
but
something
in
the
mental
or
physical
conditions
or
relations
under
which
it
arises
regarded
as
cognisable
objects
of
our
common
thought
for
certainly
if
i
in
thought
distinguish
any
feeling
from
all
its
conditions
and
concomitants
and
also
from
all
its
effects
on
the
subsequent
feelings
of
the
same
individual
or
of
others
and
contemplate
it
merely
as
the
transient
feeling
of
a
single
subject
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
find
in
it
any
other
preferable
quality
than
that
which
we
call
its
pleasantness
the
degree
of
which
is
only
cognisable
directly
by
the
sentient
individual
it
should
be
observed
that
if
this
definition
of
pleasure
be
accepted
and
if
as
before
proposed
ultimate
good
be
taken
as
equivalent
to
what
is
ultimately
desirable
the
fundamental
proposition
of
ethical
hedonism
has
chiefly
a
negative
significance
for
the
statement
that
pleasure
is
the
ultimate
good
will
only
mean
that
nothing
is
ultimately
desirable
except
desirable
feeling
apprehended
as
desirable
by
the
sentient
individual
at
the
time
of
feeling
it
this
being
so
it
may
be
urged
against
the
definition
that
it
could
not
be
accepted
by
a
moralist
of
stoical
turn
who
while
recognising
pleasure
as
a
fact
refused
to
recognise
it
as
in
any
degree
ultimately
desirable
but
i
think
such
a
moralist
ought
to
admit
an
implied
judgment
that
a
feeling
is
desirable
to
be
inseparably
connected
with
its
recognition
as
pleasure
while
holding
that
sound
philosophy
shows
the
illusoriness
of
such
judgments
this
in
fact
seems
to
have
been
substantially
the
view
of
the
stoic
school
however
this
may
be
i
conceive
that
the
preference
which
pure
hedonism
regards
as
ultimately
rational
should
be
defined
as
the
preference
of
feeling
valued
merely
as
feeling
according
to
the
estimate
implicitly
or
explicitly
made
by
the
sentient
individual
at
the
time
of
feeling
it
without
any
regard
to
the
conditions
and
relations
under
which
it
arises
accordingly
we
may
state
as
the
fundamental
assumption
of
what
i
have
called
quantitative
hedonism
implied
in
the
adoption
of
greatest
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
as
the
ultimate
end
that
all
pleasures
and
pains
estimated
merely
as
feelings
have
for
the
sentient
individual
cognisable
degrees
of
desirability
positive
or
negative
observing
further
that
the
empirical
method
of
hedonism
can
only
be
applied
so
far
as
we
assume
that
these
degrees
of
desirability
are
definitely
given
in
experience
there
is
one
more
assumption
of
a
fundamental
kind
which
is
not
perhaps
involved
in
the
acceptance
of
the
hedonistic
calculus
considered
as
purely
theoretical
but
is
certainly
implied
if
it
be
put
forward
as
a
practical
method
for
determining
right
conduct
the
assumption
namely
that
we
can
by
foresight
and
calculation
increase
our
pleasures
and
decrease
our
pains
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
pedantic
to
state
it
formally
and
in
fact
no
one
will
deny
that
the
conditions
upon
which
our
pleasures
and
pains
depend
are
to
some
extent
cognisable
by
us
and
within
our
own
control
but
as
we
shall
see
it
has
been
maintained
that
the
practice
of
hedonistic
observation
and
calculation
has
an
inevitable
tendency
to
decrease
our
pleasures
generally
or
the
most
important
of
them
so
that
it
becomes
a
question
whether
we
can
gain
our
greatest
happiness
by
seeking
it
or
at
any
rate
by
trying
to
seek
it
with
scientific
exactness
it
is
sometimes
thought
to
be
a
necessary
assumption
of
hedonists
that
a
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
is
actually
attainable
by
human
beings
a
proposition
which
an
extreme
pessimist
would
deny
but
the
conclusion
that
life
is
always
on
the
whole
painful
would
not
prove
it
to
be
unreasonable
for
a
man
to
aim
ultimately
at
minimising
pain
if
this
is
still
admitted
to
be
possible
though
it
would
no
doubt
render
immediate
suicide
by
some
painless
process
the
only
reasonable
course
for
a
perfect
egoist
unless
he
looked
forward
to
another
life
footnotes
we
find
it
sometimes
asserted
by
persons
of
enthusiastic
and
passionate
temperament
that
there
are
feelings
so
exquisitely
delightful
that
one
moment
of
their
rapture
is
preferable
to
an
eternity
of
agreeable
consciousness
of
an
inferior
kind
these
assertions
however
are
perhaps
consciously
hyperbolical
and
not
intended
to
be
taken
as
scientific
statements
but
in
the
case
of
pain
it
has
been
deliberately
maintained
by
a
thoughtful
and
subtle
writer
with
a
view
to
important
practical
conclusions
that
torture
so
extreme
as
to
be
incommensurable
with
moderate
pain
is
an
actual
fact
of
experience
see
a
chapter
in
the
ethics
of
pain
by
the
late
edmund
gurney
in
a
volume
of
essays
entitled
this
doctrine
however
does
not
correspond
to
my
own
experience
nor
does
it
appear
to
me
to
be
supported
by
the
common
sense
of
mankind
at
least
i
do
not
find
in
the
practical
forethought
of
persons
noted
for
caution
any
recognition
of
the
danger
of
agony
such
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
smallest
extra
risk
of
it
the
greatest
conceivable
amount
of
moderate
pain
should
reasonably
be
incurred
bentham
gives
four
qualities
of
any
pleasure
or
pain
taken
singly
as
important
for
purposes
of
hedonistic
calculation
intensity
duration
certainty
proximity
if
we
assume
as
above
argued
that
intensity
must
be
commensurable
with
duration
the
influence
of
the
other
qualities
on
the
comparative
value
of
pleasures
and
pains
is
not
difficult
to
determine
for
we
are
accustomed
to
estimate
the
value
of
chances
numerically
and
by
this
method
we
can
tell
exactly
in
so
far
as
the
degree
of
uncertainty
can
be
exactly
determined
how
much
the
doubtfulness
of
a
pleasure
detracts
from
its
value
and
is
a
property
which
it
is
reasonable
to
disregard
except
in
so
far
as
it
diminishes
uncertainty
for
my
feelings
a
year
hence
should
be
just
as
important
to
me
as
my
feelings
next
minute
if
only
i
could
make
an
equally
sure
forecast
of
them
indeed
this
equal
and
impartial
concern
for
all
parts
of
one
s
conscious
life
is
perhaps
the
most
prominent
element
in
the
common
notion
of
the
as
opposed
to
the
merely
pursuit
of
pleasure

empirical
hedonism
let
then
pleasure
be
defined
as
feeling
which
the
sentient
individual
at
the
time
of
feeling
it
implicitly
or
explicitly
apprehends
to
be
desirable
desirable
that
is
when
considered
merely
as
feeling
and
not
in
respect
of
its
objective
conditions
or
consequences
or
of
any
facts
that
come
directly
within
the
cognisance
and
judgment
of
others
besides
the
sentient
individual
and
let
it
be
provisionally
assumed
that
feelings
generally
can
be
compared
from
this
point
of
view
with
sufficient
definiteness
for
practical
purposes
and
empirically
known
to
be
more
or
less
pleasant
in
some
definite
degree
then
the
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
will
be
to
represent
beforehand
the
different
series
of
feelings
that
our
knowledge
of
physical
and
psychical
causes
leads
us
to
expect
from
the
different
lines
of
conduct
that
lie
open
to
us
judge
which
series
as
thus
represented
appears
on
the
whole
preferable
taking
all
probabilities
into
account
and
adopt
the
corresponding
line
of
conduct
it
may
be
objected
that
the
calculation
is
too
complex
for
practice
since
any
complete
forecast
of
the
future
would
involve
a
vast
number
of
contingencies
of
varying
degrees
of
probability
and
to
calculate
the
hedonistic
value
of
each
of
these
chances
of
feeling
would
be
interminable
still
we
may
perhaps
reduce
the
calculation
within
manageable
limits
without
serious
loss
of
accuracy
by
discarding
all
manifestly
imprudent
conduct
and
neglecting
the
less
probable
and
less
important
contingencies
as
we
do
in
some
of
the
arts
that
have
more
definite
ends
such
as
strategy
and
medicine
for
if
the
general
in
ordering
a
march
or
the
physician
in
recommending
a
change
of
abode
took
into
consideration
all
the
circumstances
that
were
at
all
relevant
to
the
end
sought
their
calculations
would
become
impracticable
accordingly
they
confine
themselves
to
the
most
important
and
we
may
deal
similarly
with
the
hedonistic
art
of
life
there
are
however
objections
urged
against
the
hedonistic
method
which
go
much
deeper
and
by
some
writers
are
pressed
to
the
extreme
of
rejecting
the
method
altogether
a
careful
examination
of
these
objections
seems
to
be
the
most
convenient
way
of
obtaining
a
clear
view
both
of
the
method
itself
and
of
the
results
that
may
reasonably
be
expected
from
it
i
should
however
point
out
that
we
are
now
only
concerned
with
what
may
be
called
objections
to
egoistic
hedonism
arguments
that
is
against
the
possibility
of
obtaining
by
it
the
results
at
which
it
aims
we
are
not
now
to
consider
whether
it
is
reasonable
for
an
individual
to
take
his
own
happiness
as
his
ultimate
end
or
how
far
the
rules
of
action
deduced
from
the
adoption
of
this
end
and
from
the
actual
conditions
of
the
individual
s
existence
will
coincide
with
current
opinions
as
to
what
is
right
these
questions
according
to
the
plan
of
my
work
are
postponed
for
future
consideration
our
sole
concern
at
present
is
with
objections
tending
to
show
the
intrinsic
impracticability
of
hedonism
as
a
rational
method
we
are
met
in
the
first
place
by
an
objection
which
if
valid
at
all
must
be
admitted
to
be
decisive
it
has
been
affirmed
by
green
that
pleasure
as
feeling
in
distinction
from
its
conditions
that
are
not
feelings
can
not
be
if
so
rational
hedonism
would
certainly
be
impossible
but
the
proposition
seems
equally
opposed
to
common
sense
and
to
the
universal
assumption
of
empirical
psychologists
who
in
investigating
elaborately
and
systematically
the
conditions
mental
and
physical
of
pleasure
and
pain
necessarily
assume
that
these
feelings
can
be
distinguished
in
thought
from
their
conditions
which
are
not
i
also
find
that
the
writer
himself
from
whom
i
have
quoted
in
a
later
treatise
conducts
long
arguments
respecting
pleasure
which
are
only
intelligible
if
the
distinction
between
pleasure
and
its
conditions
is
thoroughly
grasped
and
steadily
contemplated
indeed
he
carries
a
distinction
of
this
kind
to
an
extreme
point
of
subtlety
as
he
requires
us
to
distinguish
the
sought
in
all
desire
that
amounts
to
will
from
the
pleasure
that
there
is
in
all
if
attained
whereas
other
moralists
regard
as
a
species
of
pleasure
to
maintain
that
we
can
distinguish
pleasure
from
and
can
not
distinguish
it
from
its
conditions
seems
to
me
too
violent
a
paradox
to
need
refutation
it
is
possible
that
green
may
only
mean
that
pleasure
can
not
be
thought
to
exist
apart
from
conditions
which
are
not
feelings
and
that
it
necessarily
varies
with
any
variation
in
its
conditions
the
statement
thus
interpreted
i
do
not
deny
but
it
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
question
whether
pleasure
can
be
separately
from
its
conditions
or
whether
pleasures
received
under
different
conditions
can
be
quantitatively
compared
i
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
a
tragedy
or
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
a
farce
without
having
along
with
either
a
complex
of
innumerable
thoughts
and
images
very
diverse
in
quality
in
the
two
cases
but
this
does
not
prevent
me
from
deciding
confidently
whether
the
tragedy
or
the
farce
will
afford
me
most
pleasure
on
the
whole
i
pass
to
another
objection
made
by
the
same
writer
to
the
hedonistic
conception
of
the
supreme
end
of
action
as
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
it
should
be
the
greatest
possible
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
but
the
difference
is
unimportant
for
the
present
argument
the
phrase
he
says
is
intrinsically
unmeaning
but
his
justification
for
this
statement
appears
to
be
different
in
different
treatises
at
first
he
boldly
affirmed
that
pleasant
feelings
are
not
quantities
that
can
be
added
apparently
because
each
is
over
before
the
other
the
latter
statement
however
is
equally
true
of
the
parts
of
time
but
it
would
be
obviously
absurd
to
say
that
hours
days
years
are
not
quantities
that
can
be
possibly
this
consideration
occurred
to
green
before
writing
the
to
at
any
rate
in
the
latter
treatise
he
admits
that
states
of
pleasant
feeling
can
be
added
together
in
thought
only
denying
that
they
can
be
added
in
enjoyment
or
imagination
of
but
this
concedes
all
that
is
required
for
the
hedonistic
valuation
of
future
feelings
no
hedonist
ever
supposed
that
the
happiness
he
aims
at
making
as
great
as
possible
was
something
to
be
enjoyed
all
at
once
or
ever
wanted
to
imagine
it
as
so
enjoyed
and
unless
the
transiency
of
pleasure
diminishes
its
pleasantness
a
point
which
i
will
presently
consider
i
can
not
see
that
the
possibility
of
realising
the
hedonistic
end
is
at
all
affected
by
the
necessity
of
realising
it
in
successive
parts
green
in
another
passage
appears
to
lay
down
that
an
end
which
is
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
criterion
must
enable
us
to
distinguish
actions
that
bring
men
nearer
to
it
from
those
which
do
this
however
would
only
be
the
case
if
by
an
end
is
necessarily
meant
a
goal
or
consummation
which
after
gradually
drawing
nearer
to
it
we
reach
all
at
once
but
this
is
not
i
conceive
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
ordinarily
understood
by
ethical
writers
and
certainly
all
that
i
mean
by
it
is
an
object
of
rational
aim
whether
attained
in
successive
parts
or
not
which
is
not
sought
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
any
ulterior
object
but
for
itself
and
so
long
as
any
one
s
prospective
balance
of
pleasure
over
pain
admits
of
being
made
greater
or
less
by
immediate
action
in
one
way
or
another
there
seems
no
reason
why
maximum
happiness
should
not
provide
as
serviceable
a
criterion
of
conduct
as
any
chief
good
capable
of
being
possessed
all
at
once
or
in
some
way
independent
of
the
condition
of
time
if
however
it
be
maintained
that
the
consciousness
of
the
transiency
of
pleasure
either
makes
it
less
pleasant
at
the
time
or
causes
a
subsequent
pain
and
that
the
deliberate
and
systematic
pursuit
of
pleasure
tends
to
intensify
this
consciousness
the
proposition
if
borne
out
by
experience
would
certainly
constitute
a
relevant
objection
to
the
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
and
this
view
would
seem
to
be
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
above
quoted
though
it
is
nowhere
clearly
put
forward
since
he
affirms
that
it
is
impossible
that
should
be
found
in
any
succession
of
pleasures
as
being
satisfaction
for
a
self
that
abides
and
contemplates
itself
as
abiding
must
be
at
least
relatively
permanent
and
it
is
i
suppose
implied
that
the
disappointment
of
the
hedonist
who
fails
to
find
where
he
seeks
for
it
is
attended
with
pain
or
loss
of
pleasure
if
this
be
so
and
if
the
thus
missed
can
be
obtained
by
the
resolute
adoption
of
some
other
principle
of
action
it
would
certainly
seem
that
the
systematic
pursuit
of
pleasure
is
in
some
danger
of
defeating
itself
it
is
therefore
important
to
consider
carefully
how
far
this
is
really
the
case
so
far
as
my
own
experience
goes
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
the
mere
transiency
of
pleasures
is
a
serious
source
of
discontent
so
long
as
one
has
a
fair
prospect
of
having
as
valuable
pleasures
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
or
even
so
long
as
the
life
before
one
has
any
substantial
amount
of
pleasure
to
offer
but
i
do
not
doubt
that
an
important
element
of
happiness
for
all
or
most
men
is
derived
from
the
consciousness
of
possessing
relatively
permanent
sources
of
pleasure
whether
external
as
wealth
social
position
family
friends
or
internal
as
knowledge
culture
strong
and
lively
interest
in
the
wellbeing
of
fairly
prosperous
persons
or
institutions
this
however
does
not
in
my
opinion
constitute
an
objection
to
hedonism
it
rather
seems
obvious
from
the
hedonistic
point
of
view
that
as
soon
as
intelligence
discovers
that
there
are
fixed
objects
permanent
sources
of
pleasure
and
large
groups
of
enduring
interests
which
yield
a
variety
of
recurring
enjoyments
the
rational
will
preferring
the
greater
to
the
less
will
unfailingly
devote
its
energies
to
the
pursuit
of
it
may
be
replied
that
if
these
permanent
sources
of
pleasure
are
consciously
sought
merely
as
a
means
to
the
hedonistic
end
they
will
not
afford
the
happiness
for
which
they
are
sought
with
this
i
to
some
extent
agree
but
i
think
that
if
the
normal
complexity
of
our
impulses
be
duly
taken
into
account
this
statement
will
be
found
not
to
militate
against
the
adoption
of
hedonism
but
merely
to
signalise
a
danger
against
which
the
hedonist
has
to
guard
in
a
previous
chapter
i
have
after
butler
laid
stress
on
the
difference
between
impulses
that
are
strictly
speaking
directed
towards
pleasure
and
impulses
which
do
not
aim
at
pleasure
though
much
perhaps
most
of
our
pleasure
consists
in
the
gratification
of
these
latter
and
therefore
depends
upon
their
existence
i
there
argued
that
in
many
cases
the
two
kinds
of
impulse
are
so
far
incompatible
that
they
do
not
easily
coexist
in
the
same
moment
of
consciousness
i
added
however
that
in
the
ordinary
condition
of
our
activity
the
incompatibility
is
only
momentary
and
does
not
prevent
a
real
harmony
from
being
attained
by
a
sort
of
alternating
rhythm
of
the
two
impulses
in
consciousness
still
it
seems
undeniable
that
this
harmony
is
liable
to
be
disturbed
and
that
while
on
the
one
hand
individuals
may
and
do
sacrifice
their
greatest
apparent
happiness
to
the
gratification
of
some
imperious
particular
desire
so
on
the
other
hand
is
liable
to
engross
the
mind
to
a
degree
incompatible
with
a
healthy
and
vigorous
outflow
of
those
disinterested
impulses
towards
particular
objects
the
of
which
is
necessary
to
the
attainment
in
any
high
degree
of
the
happiness
at
which
aims
i
should
not
however
infer
from
this
that
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
is
necessarily
and
futile
but
merely
that
the
principle
of
egoistic
hedonism
when
applied
with
a
due
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
human
nature
is
practically
that
a
rational
method
of
attaining
the
end
at
which
it
aims
requires
that
we
should
to
some
extent
put
it
out
of
sight
and
not
directly
aim
at
it
i
have
before
spoken
of
this
conclusion
as
the
fundamental
paradox
of
egoistic
hedonism
but
though
it
presents
itself
as
a
paradox
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
difficulty
in
its
practical
realisation
when
once
the
danger
indicated
is
clearly
seen
for
it
is
an
experience
only
too
common
among
men
in
whatever
pursuit
they
may
be
engaged
that
they
let
the
original
object
and
goal
of
their
efforts
pass
out
of
view
and
come
to
regard
the
means
to
this
end
as
ends
in
themselves
so
that
they
at
last
even
sacrifice
the
original
end
to
the
attainment
of
what
is
only
secondarily
and
derivatively
desirable
and
if
it
be
thus
easy
and
common
to
forget
the
end
in
the
means
overmuch
there
seems
no
reason
why
it
should
be
difficult
to
do
it
to
the
extent
that
rational
egoism
prescribes
and
in
fact
it
seems
to
be
continually
done
by
ordinary
persons
in
the
case
of
amusements
and
pastimes
of
all
kinds
it
is
true
that
as
our
desires
can
not
ordinarily
be
produced
by
an
effort
of
will
though
they
can
to
some
extent
be
repressed
by
it
if
we
started
with
no
impulse
except
the
desire
of
pleasure
it
might
seem
difficult
to
execute
the
practical
paradox
of
attaining
pleasure
by
aiming
at
something
else
yet
even
in
this
hypothetical
case
the
difficulty
is
less
than
it
appears
for
the
reaction
of
our
activities
upon
our
emotional
nature
is
such
that
we
may
commonly
bring
ourselves
to
take
an
interest
in
any
end
by
concentrating
our
efforts
upon
its
attainment
so
that
even
supposing
a
man
to
begin
with
absolute
indifference
to
everything
except
his
own
pleasure
it
does
not
follow
that
if
he
were
convinced
that
the
possession
of
other
desires
and
impulses
were
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
he
could
not
succeed
in
producing
these
but
this
supposition
is
never
actually
realised
every
man
when
he
commences
the
task
of
systematising
his
conduct
whether
on
egoistic
principles
or
any
other
is
conscious
of
a
number
of
different
impulses
and
tendencies
within
him
other
than
the
mere
desire
for
pleasure
which
urge
his
will
in
particular
directions
to
the
attainment
of
particular
results
so
that
he
has
only
to
place
himself
under
certain
external
influences
and
these
desires
and
impulses
will
begin
to
operate
without
any
effort
of
will
it
is
sometimes
thought
however
that
there
is
an
important
class
of
refined
and
elevated
impulses
with
which
the
supremacy
of
is
in
a
peculiar
way
incompatible
such
as
the
love
of
virtue
or
personal
affection
or
the
religious
impulse
to
love
and
obey
god
but
at
any
rate
in
the
common
view
of
these
impulses
this
difficulty
does
not
seem
to
be
recognised
none
of
the
school
of
moralists
that
followed
shaftesbury
in
contending
that
it
is
a
man
s
true
interest
to
foster
in
himself
strictly
disinterested
social
affections
has
noted
any
inherent
incompatibility
between
the
existence
of
these
affections
and
the
supremacy
of
rational
and
similarly
christian
preachers
who
have
commended
the
religious
life
as
really
the
happiest
have
not
thought
genuine
religion
irreconcilable
with
the
conviction
that
each
man
s
own
happiness
is
his
most
near
and
intimate
concern
other
persons
however
seem
to
carry
the
religious
consciousness
and
the
feeling
of
human
affection
to
a
higher
stage
of
refinement
at
which
a
stricter
disinterestedness
is
exacted
they
maintain
that
the
essence
of
either
feeling
in
its
best
form
is
absolute
and
and
certainly
these
seem
incompatible
with
however
cautiously
a
man
can
not
both
wish
to
secure
his
own
happiness
and
be
willing
to
lose
it
and
yet
how
if
willingness
to
lose
it
is
the
true
means
of
securing
it
can
not
merely
reduce
indirectly
its
prominence
in
consciousness
but
directly
and
unreservedly
annihilate
itself
this
emotional
feat
does
not
seem
to
me
possible
and
therefore
i
must
admit
that
a
man
who
embraces
the
principle
of
rational
egoism
cuts
himself
off
from
the
special
pleasure
that
attends
this
absolute
sacrifice
and
abnegation
of
self
but
however
exquisite
this
may
be
the
pitch
of
emotional
exaltation
and
refinement
necessary
to
attain
it
is
comparatively
so
rare
that
it
is
scarcely
included
in
men
s
common
estimate
of
happiness
i
do
not
therefore
think
that
an
important
objection
to
rational
egoism
can
be
based
upon
its
incompatibility
with
this
particular
consciousness
nor
that
the
common
experience
of
mankind
really
sustains
the
view
that
the
desire
of
one
s
own
happiness
if
accepted
as
supreme
and
regulative
inevitably
defeats
its
own
aim
through
the
consequent
diminution
and
desiccation
of
the
impulses
and
emotional
capacities
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
happiness
in
a
high
degree
though
it
certainly
shows
a
serious
and
subtle
danger
in
this
direction
there
is
however
another
way
in
which
the
habit
of
mind
necessarily
resulting
from
the
continual
practice
of
hedonistic
comparison
is
sometimes
thought
to
be
unfavourable
to
the
attainment
of
the
hedonistic
end
from
a
supposed
incompatibility
between
the
habit
of
reflectively
observing
and
examining
pleasure
and
the
capacity
for
experiencing
pleasure
in
normal
fulness
and
intensity
and
it
certainly
seems
important
to
consider
what
effect
the
continual
attention
to
our
pleasures
in
order
to
observe
their
different
degrees
is
likely
to
have
on
these
feelings
themselves
the
inquiry
at
first
sight
seems
to
lead
to
irreconcilable
contradiction
in
our
view
of
pleasure
for
if
pleasure
only
exists
as
it
is
felt
the
more
conscious
we
are
of
it
the
more
pleasure
we
have
and
it
would
seem
that
the
more
our
attention
is
directed
towards
it
the
more
fully
we
shall
be
conscious
of
it
on
the
other
hand
hamilton
s
statement
that
knowledge
and
feeling
cognition
and
pleasure
or
pain
are
always
in
a
certain
inverse
proportion
to
each
other
corresponds
to
our
common
experience
for
the
purely
cognitive
element
of
consciousness
seems
to
be
neither
pleasurable
nor
painful
so
that
the
more
our
consciousness
is
occupied
with
cognition
the
less
room
there
seems
to
be
for
feeling
this
view
however
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
total
intensity
of
our
consciousness
is
a
constant
quantity
so
that
when
one
element
of
it
positively
increases
the
rest
must
positively
as
well
as
relatively
diminish
and
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
experience
gives
us
any
valid
ground
for
making
this
general
assumption
it
rather
seems
that
at
certain
times
in
our
life
intellect
and
feeling
are
simultaneously
feeble
so
that
the
same
mental
excitement
may
intensify
both
simultaneously
still
it
seems
to
be
a
fact
that
any
very
powerful
feeling
reaching
to
the
full
intensity
of
which
our
consciousness
is
normally
capable
is
commonly
diminished
by
a
contemporaneous
stroke
of
cognitive
effort
hence
it
is
a
general
difficulty
in
the
way
of
exact
observation
of
our
emotions
that
the
object
cognised
seems
to
shrink
and
dwindle
in
proportion
as
the
cognitive
regard
grows
keen
and
eager
how
then
are
we
to
reconcile
this
with
the
proposition
first
laid
down
that
pleasure
only
exists
as
we
are
conscious
of
it
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
the
mere
consciousness
of
a
present
feeling
apart
from
any
distinct
representative
elements
can
not
diminish
the
feeling
of
which
it
is
an
indispensable
and
inseparable
condition
but
in
introspective
cognition
we
go
beyond
the
present
feeling
comparing
and
classifying
it
with
remembered
or
imagined
feelings
and
the
effort
of
representing
and
comparing
these
other
feelings
tends
to
decrease
the
mere
presentative
consciousness
of
the
actual
pleasure
i
conclude
then
that
there
is
a
real
danger
of
diminishing
pleasure
by
the
attempt
to
observe
and
estimate
it
but
the
danger
seems
only
to
arise
in
the
case
of
very
intense
pleasures
and
only
if
the
attempt
is
made
at
the
moment
of
actual
enjoyment
and
since
the
most
delightful
periods
of
life
have
frequently
recurring
intervals
of
nearly
neutral
feeling
in
which
the
pleasures
immediately
past
may
be
compared
and
estimated
without
any
such
detriment
i
do
not
regard
the
objection
founded
on
this
danger
as
particularly
important
more
serious
in
my
opinion
are
the
objections
urged
against
the
possibility
of
performing
with
definite
and
trustworthy
results
the
comprehensive
and
methodical
comparison
of
pleasures
and
pains
which
the
adoption
of
the
hedonistic
standard
involves
i
can
not
indeed
doubt
that
men
habitually
compare
pleasures
and
pains
in
respect
of
their
intensity
that
when
we
pass
from
one
state
of
consciousness
to
another
or
when
in
any
way
we
are
led
to
recall
a
state
long
past
we
often
unhesitatingly
declare
the
present
state
to
be
more
or
less
pleasant
than
the
past
or
that
we
declare
some
pleasant
experiences
to
have
been
worth
and
others
not
worth
the
trouble
it
took
to
obtain
them
or
the
pain
that
followed
them
but
granting
this
it
may
still
be
maintained
that
this
comparison
as
ordinarily
made
is
both
occasional
and
very
rough
and
that
it
can
never
be
extended
as
systematic
hedonism
requires
nor
applied
with
any
accuracy
to
all
possible
states
however
differing
in
quality
and
that
as
commonly
practised
it
is
liable
to
illusion
of
which
we
can
never
measure
the
precise
amount
while
we
are
continually
forced
to
recognise
its
existence
this
illusion
was
even
urged
by
plato
as
a
ground
for
distrusting
the
apparent
affirmation
of
consciousness
in
respect
of
pleasure
plato
thought
that
the
apparent
intensity
of
the
coarser
bodily
pleasures
was
illusory
because
these
states
of
consciousness
being
preceded
by
pain
were
really
only
states
of
relief
from
pain
and
so
properly
neutral
neither
pleasant
nor
painful
examples
of
what
i
have
called
the
hedonistic
zero
only
appearing
pleasant
from
contrast
with
the
preceding
pain
to
this
however
it
has
been
answered
that
in
estimating
pleasure
there
is
no
conceivable
appeal
from
the
immediate
decision
of
consciousness
that
here
the
phenomenal
is
the
real
there
is
no
other
real
that
we
can
distinguish
from
it
and
this
seems
to
me
true
in
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
present
state
but
then
apart
from
the
difficulty
just
noticed
of
observing
a
pleasure
while
it
is
felt
without
thereby
diminishing
it
it
is
obvious
that
in
any
estimate
of
its
intensity
we
are
necessarily
comparing
it
with
some
other
state
and
this
latter
must
generally
be
a
representation
not
an
actual
feeling
for
though
we
can
sometimes
experience
two
or
perhaps
more
pleasures
at
once
we
are
rarely
in
such
cases
able
to
compare
them
satisfactorily
for
either
the
causes
of
the
two
mutually
interfere
so
that
neither
reaches
its
normal
degree
of
intensity
or
more
often
the
two
blend
into
one
state
of
pleasant
consciousness
the
elements
of
which
we
can
not
estimate
separately
but
if
it
is
therefore
inevitable
that
one
term
at
least
in
our
comparison
should
be
an
imagined
pleasure
we
see
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
error
in
any
such
comparison
for
the
imagined
feeling
may
not
adequately
represent
the
pleasantness
of
the
corresponding
actual
feeling
and
in
the
egoistic
comparison
the
validity
of
which
we
are
now
discussing
the
objects
primarily
to
be
compared
are
all
represented
elements
of
consciousness
for
we
are
desiring
to
choose
between
two
or
more
possible
courses
of
conduct
and
therefore
to
forecast
future
feelings
let
us
then
examine
more
closely
the
manner
in
which
this
comparison
is
ordinarily
performed
that
we
may
see
what
positive
grounds
we
have
for
mistrusting
it
in
estimating
for
practical
purposes
the
value
of
different
pleasures
open
to
us
we
commonly
trust
most
to
our
prospective
imagination
we
project
ourselves
into
the
future
and
imagine
what
such
and
such
a
pleasure
will
amount
to
under
hypothetical
conditions
this
imagination
so
far
as
it
involves
conscious
inference
seems
to
be
chiefly
determined
by
our
own
experience
of
past
pleasures
which
are
usually
recalled
generically
or
in
large
aggregates
though
sometimes
particular
instances
of
important
single
pleasures
occur
to
us
as
definitely
remembered
but
partly
too
we
are
influenced
by
the
experience
of
others
sympathetically
appropriated
and
here
again
we
sometimes
definitely
refer
to
particular
experiences
which
have
been
communicated
to
us
by
individuals
and
sometimes
to
the
traditional
generalisations
which
are
thought
to
represent
the
common
experience
of
mankind
now
it
does
not
seem
that
such
a
process
as
this
is
likely
to
be
free
from
error
and
indeed
no
one
pretends
that
it
is
in
fact
there
is
scarcely
any
point
upon
which
moralisers
have
dwelt
with
more
emphasis
than
this
that
man
s
forecast
of
pleasure
is
continually
erroneous
each
of
us
frequently
recognises
his
own
mistakes
and
each
still
more
often
attributes
to
others
errors
unseen
by
themselves
arising
either
from
misinterpretation
of
their
own
experience
or
from
ignorance
or
neglect
of
that
of
others
how
then
are
these
errors
to
be
eliminated
the
obvious
answer
is
that
we
must
substitute
for
the
instinctive
largely
implicit
inference
just
described
a
more
scientific
process
of
reasoning
by
deducing
the
probable
degree
of
our
future
pleasure
or
pain
in
any
given
circumstances
from
inductive
generalisations
based
on
a
sufficient
number
of
careful
observations
of
our
own
and
others
experience
we
have
then
to
ask
first
how
far
can
each
of
us
estimate
accurately
his
own
past
experience
of
pleasures
and
pains
secondly
how
far
can
this
knowledge
of
the
past
enable
him
to
forecast
with
any
certainty
the
greatest
happiness
within
his
reach
in
the
future
thirdly
how
far
can
he
appropriate
for
the
purposes
of
such
forecasts
the
past
experience
of
others
as
regards
the
first
of
these
questions
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
know
generally
that
we
derive
pleasures
and
pains
from
such
and
such
sources
we
require
to
know
approximately
the
positive
or
negative
degree
of
each
feeling
unless
we
can
form
some
quantitative
estimate
of
them
it
is
futile
to
try
to
attain
our
happiness
at
least
by
an
empirical
method
we
have
therefore
to
compare
quantitatively
each
pleasure
as
it
occurs
or
as
recalled
in
imagination
with
other
imagined
pleasures
and
the
question
is
how
far
such
comparisons
can
be
regarded
as
trustworthy
now
for
my
own
part
when
i
reflect
on
my
pleasures
and
pains
and
endeavour
to
compare
them
in
respect
of
intensity
it
is
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
that
i
can
obtain
clear
and
definite
results
from
such
comparisons
even
taking
each
separately
in
its
simplest
form
whether
the
comparison
is
made
at
the
moment
of
experiencing
one
of
the
pleasures
or
between
two
states
of
consciousness
recalled
in
imagination
this
is
true
even
when
i
compare
feelings
of
the
same
kind
and
the
vagueness
and
uncertainty
increases
in
proportion
as
the
feelings
differ
in
kind
let
us
begin
with
sensual
gratifications
which
are
thought
to
be
especially
definite
and
palpable
suppose
i
am
enjoying
a
good
dinner
if
i
ask
myself
whether
one
kind
of
dish
or
wine
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
another
sometimes
i
can
decide
but
very
often
not
so
if
i
reflect
upon
two
modes
of
bodily
exercise
that
i
may
have
taken
if
one
has
been
in
a
marked
degree
agreeable
or
tedious
i
take
note
of
it
naturally
but
it
is
not
natural
to
me
to
go
further
than
this
in
judging
of
their
pleasurableness
or
painfulness
and
the
attempt
to
do
so
does
not
seem
to
lead
to
any
clear
affirmation
and
similarly
of
intellectual
exercises
and
states
of
consciousness
predominantly
emotional
even
when
the
causes
and
quality
of
the
feelings
compared
are
similar
it
is
only
when
the
differences
in
pleasantness
are
great
that
hedonistic
comparison
seems
to
yield
any
definite
result
but
when
i
try
to
arrange
in
a
scale
pleasures
differing
in
kind
to
compare
labour
with
rest
excitement
with
tranquillity
intellectual
exercise
with
emotional
effusion
the
pleasure
of
scientific
apprehension
with
that
of
beneficent
action
the
delight
of
social
expansion
with
the
delight
of
æsthetic
reception
my
judgment
wavers
and
fluctuates
far
more
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
i
can
not
give
any
confident
decision
and
if
this
is
the
case
with
what
bentham
calls
pure
painless
pleasures
it
is
still
more
true
of
those
even
commoner
states
of
consciousness
where
a
certain
amount
of
pain
or
discomfort
is
mixed
with
pleasure
although
the
latter
preponderates
if
it
is
hard
to
say
which
of
two
different
states
of
contentment
was
the
greater
pleasure
it
seems
still
harder
to
compare
a
state
of
placid
satisfaction
with
one
of
eager
but
hopeful
suspense
or
with
triumphant
conquest
of
painful
obstacles
and
perhaps
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
compare
pure
pleasures
with
pure
pains
and
to
say
how
much
of
the
one
kind
of
feeling
we
consider
to
be
exactly
balanced
by
a
given
amount
of
the
other
when
they
do
not
occur
simultaneously
while
an
estimate
of
simultaneous
feelings
is
as
we
have
seen
generally
unsatisfactory
from
the
mutual
interference
of
their
respective
causes
but
again
if
these
judgments
are
not
clear
and
definite
still
less
are
they
consistent
i
do
not
now
mean
that
one
man
s
estimate
of
the
value
of
any
kind
of
pleasures
differs
from
another
s
for
we
have
assumed
each
sentient
individual
to
be
the
final
judge
of
the
pleasantness
and
painfulness
of
his
own
feelings
and
therefore
this
kind
of
discrepancy
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
judgments
and
creates
no
difficulty
until
any
one
tries
to
appropriate
the
experience
of
others
but
i
mean
that
each
individual
s
judgment
of
the
comparative
value
of
his
own
pleasures
is
apt
to
be
different
at
different
times
though
it
relates
to
the
same
past
experiences
and
that
this
variation
is
a
legitimate
ground
for
distrusting
the
validity
of
any
particular
comparison
the
causes
of
this
variation
seem
to
be
partly
due
to
the
nature
of
the
represented
feeling
and
partly
to
the
general
state
of
the
mind
at
the
time
of
making
the
representation
to
begin
with
the
former
we
find
that
different
kinds
of
past
pleasures
and
pains
do
not
equally
admit
of
being
revived
in
imagination
thus
generally
speaking
our
more
emotional
and
more
representative
pains
are
more
easily
revived
than
the
more
sensational
and
presentative
for
example
it
is
at
this
moment
much
more
easy
for
me
to
imagine
the
discomfort
of
expectancy
which
preceded
a
past
than
the
pain
of
the
actual
nausea
although
i
infer
from
the
recollection
of
judgments
passed
at
the
time
that
the
former
pain
was
trifling
compared
with
the
latter
to
this
cause
it
seems
due
that
past
hardships
toils
and
anxieties
often
appear
pleasurable
when
we
look
back
upon
them
after
some
interval
for
the
excitement
the
heightened
sense
of
life
that
accompanied
the
painful
struggle
would
have
been
pleasurable
if
taken
by
itself
and
it
is
this
that
we
recall
rather
than
the
pain
in
estimating
pleasures
the
other
cause
of
variation
is
more
conspicuous
we
are
conscious
of
changes
occasional
or
periodic
in
our
estimate
of
them
depending
upon
changes
in
our
mental
or
bodily
condition
it
is
a
matter
of
common
remark
with
respect
to
the
gratifications
of
appetite
that
we
can
not
estimate
them
adequately
in
the
state
of
satiety
and
that
we
are
apt
to
exaggerate
them
in
the
state
of
desire
i
do
not
deny
that
intensity
of
antecedent
desire
intensifies
the
pleasure
of
fruition
so
that
this
pleasure
not
only
as
plato
thought
but
actually
is
greater
owing
to
the
strength
of
the
desire
that
has
preceded
still
it
is
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
pleasures
which
have
been
intensely
desired
are
often
found
to
disappoint
expectation
there
seem
to
be
no
special
states
of
aversion
determined
by
bodily
causes
and
related
to
certain
pains
as
our
appetites
to
their
correspondent
pleasures
but
most
persons
are
liable
to
be
thrown
by
the
prospect
of
certain
pains
into
the
state
of
passionate
aversion
which
we
call
fear
and
to
be
thereby
led
to
estimate
such
pains
as
worse
than
they
would
be
judged
to
be
in
a
calmer
mood
further
when
feeling
any
kind
of
pain
or
uneasiness
we
seem
liable
to
underrate
pain
of
a
very
dissimilar
kind
thus
in
danger
we
value
repose
overlooking
its
while
the
tedium
of
security
makes
us
imagine
the
mingled
excitement
of
past
danger
as
almost
purely
pleasurable
and
again
when
we
are
absorbed
in
any
particular
pleasant
activity
the
pleasures
attending
dissimilar
activities
are
apt
to
be
contemned
they
appear
coarse
or
thin
as
the
case
may
be
and
this
constitutes
a
fundamental
objection
to
noting
the
exact
degree
of
a
pleasure
at
the
time
of
experiencing
it
the
eager
desire
which
often
seems
an
indispensable
element
of
the
whole
state
of
pleasurable
activity
generally
involves
a
similar
bias
indeed
any
strong
excitement
in
which
our
thought
is
concentrated
on
a
single
result
or
group
of
results
whether
it
be
the
excitement
of
aversion
fear
hope
or
suspense
tends
to
make
us
inappreciative
of
alien
pleasures
and
pains
alike
and
speaking
more
generally
we
can
not
imagine
as
very
intense
a
pleasure
of
a
kind
that
at
the
time
of
imagining
it
we
are
incapable
of
experiencing
as
the
pleasures
of
intellectual
or
bodily
exercise
at
the
close
of
a
wearying
day
or
any
emotional
pleasure
when
our
susceptibility
to
the
special
emotion
is
temporarily
exhausted
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
easy
to
guard
against
error
as
philosophers
have
often
thought
by
making
our
estimate
in
a
cool
and
passionless
state
for
there
are
many
pleasures
which
require
precedent
desire
and
even
enthusiasm
and
highly
wrought
excitement
in
order
to
be
experienced
in
their
full
intensity
and
it
is
not
likely
that
we
should
appreciate
these
adequately
in
a
state
of
perfect
tranquillity
these
considerations
make
clearer
the
extent
of
the
assumptions
of
empirical
quantitative
hedonism
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
viz
that
our
pleasures
and
pains
have
each
a
definite
degree
and
that
this
degree
is
empirically
cognisable
firstly
if
pleasure
only
exists
as
it
is
felt
the
belief
that
every
pleasure
and
pain
has
a
definite
intensive
quantity
or
degree
must
remain
an
assumption
incapable
of
positive
empirical
verification
for
the
pleasure
can
only
have
the
degree
as
compared
with
other
feelings
of
the
same
or
some
different
kind
but
generally
speaking
since
this
comparison
can
only
be
made
in
imagination
it
can
only
yield
the
hypothetical
result
that
if
certain
feelings
could
be
felt
together
precisely
as
they
have
been
felt
separately
one
would
be
found
more
desirable
than
the
other
in
some
definite
ratio
if
then
we
are
asked
what
ground
we
have
for
regarding
this
imaginary
result
as
a
valid
representation
of
reality
we
can
not
say
more
than
that
the
belief
in
its
general
validity
is
irresistibly
suggested
in
reflection
on
experience
and
remains
at
any
rate
uncontradicted
by
experience
but
secondly
granting
that
each
of
our
pleasures
and
pains
has
really
a
definite
degree
of
pleasantness
or
painfulness
the
question
still
remains
whether
we
have
any
means
of
accurately
measuring
these
degrees
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
mind
is
ever
in
such
a
state
as
to
be
a
perfectly
neutral
and
colourless
medium
for
imagining
all
kinds
of
pleasures
experience
certainly
shows
us
the
frequent
occurrence
of
moods
in
which
we
have
an
apparent
bias
for
or
against
a
particular
kind
of
feeling
is
it
not
probable
that
there
is
always
some
bias
of
this
kind
that
we
are
always
more
in
tune
for
some
pleasures
more
sensitive
to
some
pains
than
we
are
to
others
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
exact
cognition
of
the
place
of
each
kind
of
feeling
in
a
scale
of
desirability
measured
positively
and
negatively
from
a
zero
of
perfect
indifference
is
at
best
an
ideal
to
which
we
can
never
tell
how
closely
we
approximate
still
in
the
variations
of
our
judgment
and
the
disappointment
of
our
expectations
we
have
experience
of
errors
of
which
we
can
trace
the
causes
and
allow
for
them
at
least
roughly
correcting
in
thought
the
defects
of
imagination
and
since
what
we
require
for
practical
guidance
is
to
estimate
not
individual
past
experiences
but
the
value
of
a
kind
of
pleasure
or
pain
as
obtained
under
certain
circumstances
or
conditions
we
can
to
some
extent
diminish
the
chance
of
error
in
this
estimate
by
making
a
number
of
observations
and
imaginative
comparisons
at
different
times
and
in
different
moods
in
so
far
as
these
agree
we
may
legitimately
feel
an
increased
confidence
in
the
result
and
in
so
far
as
they
differ
we
can
at
least
reduce
our
possible
error
by
striking
an
average
of
the
different
estimates
it
will
be
evident
however
that
such
a
method
as
this
can
not
be
expected
to
yield
more
than
a
rough
approximation
to
the
supposed
truth
we
must
conclude
then
that
our
estimate
of
the
hedonistic
value
of
any
past
pleasure
or
pain
is
liable
to
an
amount
of
error
which
we
can
not
calculate
exactly
because
the
represented
pleasantness
of
different
feelings
fluctuates
and
varies
indefinitely
with
changes
in
the
actual
condition
of
the
representing
mind
we
have
now
to
observe
that
for
similar
reasons
even
supposing
we
could
adequately
allow
for
and
so
exclude
this
source
of
error
in
our
comparison
of
past
pleasures
it
is
liable
to
intrude
again
in
arguing
from
the
past
to
the
future
for
our
capacity
for
particular
pleasures
may
be
about
to
change
or
may
have
actually
changed
since
the
experiences
that
form
the
data
of
our
calculation
we
may
have
reached
the
point
of
satiety
in
respect
of
some
of
our
past
pleasures
or
otherwise
lost
our
susceptibility
to
them
owing
to
latent
changes
in
our
constitution
or
we
may
have
increased
our
susceptibility
to
pains
inevitably
connected
with
them
or
altered
conditions
of
life
may
have
generated
in
us
new
desires
and
aversions
and
given
relative
importance
to
new
sources
of
happiness
or
any
or
all
of
these
changes
may
be
expected
to
occur
before
the
completion
of
the
course
of
conduct
upon
which
we
are
now
deciding
the
most
careful
estimate
of
a
girl
s
pleasures
supposing
a
girl
gifted
with
the
abnormal
habit
of
reflection
that
would
be
necessary
would
not
much
profit
a
young
woman
and
the
hedonistic
calculations
of
youth
require
modification
as
we
advance
in
years
it
may
be
said
however
that
no
one
in
making
such
a
forecast
can
or
does
rely
entirely
on
his
own
experience
when
endeavouring
to
estimate
the
probable
effect
upon
his
happiness
of
new
circumstances
and
influences
untried
rules
of
conduct
and
fashions
of
life
he
always
argues
partly
from
the
experience
of
others
this
is
i
think
generally
true
but
by
including
inferences
from
other
men
s
experience
we
inevitably
introduce
a
new
possibility
of
error
for
such
inference
proceeds
on
the
assumption
of
a
similarity
of
nature
among
human
beings
which
is
never
exactly
true
while
we
can
never
exactly
know
how
much
it
falls
short
of
the
truth
though
we
have
sufficient
evidence
of
the
striking
differences
between
the
feelings
produced
in
different
men
by
similar
causes
to
convince
us
that
the
assumption
would
in
many
cases
be
wholly
misleading
on
this
ground
plato
s
reason
for
claiming
that
the
life
of
the
philosopher
has
more
pleasure
than
that
of
the
sensualist
is
palpably
inadequate
the
philosopher
he
argues
has
tried
both
kinds
of
pleasure
sensual
as
well
as
intellectual
and
prefers
the
delights
of
philosophic
life
the
sensualist
ought
therefore
to
trust
his
decision
and
follow
his
example
but
who
can
tell
that
the
philosopher
s
constitution
is
not
such
as
to
render
the
enjoyments
of
the
senses
in
his
case
comparatively
feeble
while
on
the
other
hand
the
sensualist
s
mind
may
not
be
able
to
attain
more
than
a
thin
shadow
of
the
philosopher
s
delight
and
so
generally
speaking
if
we
are
to
be
guided
by
another
s
experience
we
require
to
be
convinced
not
only
that
he
is
generally
accurate
in
observing
analysing
and
comparing
his
sensations
but
also
that
his
relative
susceptibility
to
the
different
kinds
of
pleasure
and
pain
in
question
coincides
with
our
own
if
he
is
unpractised
in
introspective
observation
it
is
possible
that
he
may
mistake
even
the
external
conditions
of
his
own
happiness
and
so
the
communication
of
his
experience
may
be
altogether
misleading
but
however
accurately
he
has
analysed
and
determined
the
causes
of
his
feelings
that
similar
causes
would
produce
similar
effects
in
us
must
always
be
uncertain
and
the
uncertainty
is
increased
indefinitely
if
our
adviser
has
to
recall
in
memory
out
of
a
distant
past
some
of
the
pleasures
or
pains
to
be
compared
thus
in
the
controversy
between
age
and
youth
wisdom
is
not
after
all
so
clearly
on
the
side
of
maturer
counsels
as
it
seems
to
be
at
first
sight
when
a
youth
is
warned
by
his
senior
to
abstain
from
some
pleasure
on
the
ground
of
prudence
because
it
is
not
worth
the
possible
pleasures
that
must
be
sacrificed
for
it
and
the
future
pains
that
it
will
entail
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
know
how
far
the
elder
man
can
recall
even
if
he
could
once
feel
the
full
rapture
of
the
delight
that
he
is
asking
the
younger
to
renounce
and
further
this
source
of
error
besets
us
in
a
more
extended
and
more
subtle
manner
than
has
yet
been
noticed
for
our
sympathetic
apprehension
of
alien
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
has
been
so
continually
exercised
in
so
many
ways
during
the
whole
of
our
life
both
by
actual
observation
and
oral
communication
with
other
human
beings
and
through
books
and
other
modes
of
symbolic
suggestion
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
far
it
has
unconsciously
blended
with
our
own
experience
so
as
to
colour
and
modify
it
when
represented
in
memory
thus
we
may
easily
overlook
the
discrepancy
between
our
own
experience
and
that
of
others
in
respect
of
the
importance
of
certain
sources
of
pleasure
and
pain
if
no
sudden
and
striking
disappointment
of
expectations
forces
it
on
our
notice
only
with
considerable
care
and
attention
can
sympathetic
persons
separate
their
own
real
likes
and
dislikes
from
those
of
their
associates
and
we
can
never
tell
whether
this
separation
has
been
completely
effected
but
again
the
practical
inference
from
the
past
to
the
future
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
we
can
alter
ourselves
for
it
may
be
that
our
past
experience
has
been
greatly
affected
by
our
being
not
properly
attuned
to
certain
pleasures
as
those
of
art
or
study
or
muscular
exercise
or
society
or
beneficent
action
or
not
duly
hardened
against
certain
sources
of
pain
such
as
toil
or
anxiety
or
abstinence
from
luxuries
and
there
may
be
within
our
power
some
process
of
training
or
hardening
ourselves
which
may
profoundly
modify
our
susceptibilities
and
this
consideration
is
especially
important
and
at
the
same
time
especially
difficult
to
deal
with
when
we
attempt
to
appropriate
the
experience
of
another
for
we
may
find
that
he
estimates
highly
pleasures
which
we
not
only
have
never
experienced
at
all
but
can
not
possibly
experience
without
a
considerable
alteration
of
our
nature
for
example
the
pleasures
of
the
religious
life
the
raptures
of
prayer
and
praise
and
the
devotion
of
the
soul
to
god
are
commonly
thought
to
require
conversion
or
complete
change
of
nature
before
they
can
be
experienced
and
in
the
same
way
the
sacrifice
of
sensual
inclination
to
duty
is
disagreeable
to
the
man
when
he
at
first
attempts
it
but
affords
to
the
truly
virtuous
man
a
deep
and
strong
delight
and
similarly
almost
all
the
more
refined
intellectual
and
emotional
pleasures
require
training
and
culture
in
order
to
be
enjoyed
and
since
this
training
does
not
always
succeed
in
producing
any
considerable
degree
of
susceptibility
it
may
always
be
a
matter
of
doubt
for
one
from
whom
it
would
require
the
sacrifice
of
other
pleasures
whether
such
sacrifice
is
worth
making
the
foregoing
considerations
must
i
think
seriously
reduce
our
confidence
in
what
i
have
called
the
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
i
do
not
conclude
that
we
should
reject
it
altogether
i
am
conscious
that
in
spite
of
all
the
difficulties
that
i
have
urged
i
continue
to
make
comparisons
between
pleasures
and
pains
with
practical
reliance
on
their
results
but
i
conclude
that
it
would
be
at
least
highly
desirable
with
a
view
to
the
systematic
direction
of
conduct
to
control
and
supplement
the
results
of
such
comparisons
by
the
assistance
of
some
other
method
if
we
can
find
any
on
which
we
see
reason
to
rely

are
more

seek
and
consciously
estimate
the
objective
conditions
and
sources
of
happiness
rather
than
happiness
itself
and
it
may
plausibly
be
said
that
by
relying
on
such
estimates
of
objects
we
avoid
the
difficulties
that
beset
the
introspective
method
of
comparing
feelings
and
that
the
common
opinions
as
to
the
value
of
different
sources
of
pleasure
express
the
net
result
of
the
combined
experience
of
mankind
from
generation
to
generation
in
which
the
divergences
due
to
the
limitations
of
each
individual
s
experience
and
to
the
differently
tinged
moods
in
which
different
estimates
have
been
taken
have
balanced
and
neutralised
each
other
and
so
disappeared
i
do
not
wish
to
undervalue
the
guidance
of
common
sense
in
our
pursuit
of
happiness
i
think
however
that
when
we
consider
these
common
opinions
as
premises
for
the
deductions
of
systematic
egoism
they
must
be
admitted
to
be
open
to
the
following
grave
objections
in
the
first
place
common
sense
gives
us
only
at
the
best
an
estimate
true
for
an
average
or
typical
human
being
and
as
we
have
already
seen
it
is
probable
that
any
particular
individual
will
be
more
or
less
divergent
from
this
type
in
any
case
therefore
each
person
will
have
to
correct
the
estimate
of
common
opinion
by
the
results
of
his
own
experience
in
order
to
obtain
from
it
trustworthy
guidance
for
his
own
conduct
and
this
process
of
correction
it
would
seem
must
be
involved
in
all
the
difficulties
from
which
we
are
trying
to
escape
but
secondly
the
experience
of
the
mass
of
mankind
is
confined
within
limits
too
narrow
for
its
results
to
be
of
much
avail
in
the
present
inquiry
the
majority
of
human
beings
spend
most
of
their
time
in
labouring
to
avert
starvation
and
severe
bodily
discomfort
and
the
brief
leisure
that
remains
to
them
after
supplying
the
bodily
needs
of
food
sleep
is
spent
in
ways
determined
rather
by
impulse
routine
and
habit
than
by
a
deliberate
estimate
of
probable
pleasure
it
would
seem
then
that
the
common
sense
to
which
we
have
here
to
refer
can
only
be
that
of
a
minority
of
comparatively
rich
and
leisured
persons
but
again
we
can
not
tell
that
the
mass
of
mankind
or
any
section
of
the
mass
is
not
generally
and
normally
under
the
influence
of
some
of
the
causes
of
previously
noticed
we
avoid
the
idols
of
the
cave
by
trusting
common
sense
but
what
is
to
guard
us
against
the
idols
of
the
tribe
moreover
the
common
estimate
of
different
sources
of
happiness
seems
to
involve
all
the
confusion
of
ideas
and
points
of
view
which
in
defining
the
empirical
method
of
hedonism
we
have
taken
some
pains
to
eliminate
in
the
first
place
it
does
not
distinguish
between
objects
of
natural
desire
and
sources
of
experienced
pleasure
now
we
have
seen
book
chap
iv
that
these
two
are
not
exactly
coincident
indeed
we
find
numerous
examples
of
men
who
continue
not
only
to
feel
but
to
indulge
desires
the
gratification
of
which
they
know
by
ample
experience
to
be
attended
with
more
pain
than
pleasure
and
therefore
the
current
estimate
of
the
desirability
of
objects
of
pursuit
can
not
be
taken
to
express
simply
men
s
experience
of
pleasure
and
pain
for
men
are
apt
to
think
desirable
what
they
strongly
desire
whether
or
not
they
have
found
it
conducive
to
happiness
on
the
whole
and
so
the
common
opinion
will
tend
to
represent
a
compromise
between
the
average
force
of
desires
and
the
average
experience
of
the
consequences
of
gratifying
them
we
must
allow
again
for
the
intermingling
of
moral
with
purely
hedonistic
preferences
in
the
estimate
of
common
sense
for
even
when
men
definitely
expect
greater
happiness
from
the
course
of
conduct
which
they
choose
than
from
any
other
it
is
often
because
they
think
it
the
right
or
more
excellent
or
more
noble
course
making
more
or
less
unconsciously
the
assumption
which
we
shall
presently
have
to
consider
that
the
morally
best
action
will
prove
to
be
also
the
most
conducive
to
the
agent
s
happiness
and
a
similar
assumption
seems
to
be
made
without
adequate
warrant
as
regards
merely
æsthetic
preferences
again
the
introduction
of
the
moral
and
æsthetic
points
of
view
suggests
the
following
doubt
are
we
to
be
guided
by
the
preferences
which
men
avow
or
by
those
which
their
actions
would
lead
us
to
infer
on
the
one
hand
we
can
not
doubt
that
men
often
from
weakness
of
character
fail
to
seek
what
they
sincerely
believe
will
give
them
most
pleasure
in
the
on
the
other
hand
as
a
genuine
preference
for
virtuous
or
refined
pleasure
is
a
mark
of
genuine
virtue
or
refined
taste
men
who
do
not
really
feel
such
preference
are
unconsciously
or
consciously
influenced
by
a
desire
to
gain
credit
for
it
and
their
express
estimate
of
pleasures
is
thus
modified
and
coloured
but
even
if
we
had
no
doubt
on
general
grounds
that
common
sense
would
prove
our
best
guide
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
we
should
still
be
perplexed
by
finding
its
utterances
on
this
topic
very
deficient
in
clearness
and
consistency
i
do
not
merely
mean
that
they
are
different
in
different
ages
and
countries
that
we
might
explain
as
due
to
variations
in
the
general
conditions
of
human
life
but
that
serious
conflicts
and
ambiguities
are
found
if
we
consider
only
the
current
common
sense
of
our
own
age
and
country
we
can
make
a
list
of
sources
of
happiness
apparently
recommended
by
an
overwhelming
of
current
opinion
as
health
wealth
friendship
and
family
affections
fame
and
social
position
power
interesting
and
congenial
occupation
and
amusement
including
the
gratification
in
some
form
of
the
love
of
knowledge
and
of
those
refined
partly
sensual
partly
emotional
susceptibilities
which
we
call
æsthetic
but
if
we
inquire
into
the
relative
value
of
these
objects
of
common
pursuit
we
seem
to
get
no
clear
answer
from
common
sense
unless
perhaps
it
would
be
generally
agreed
that
health
ought
to
be
paramount
to
all
other
secondary
ends
though
even
on
this
point
we
could
not
infer
general
agreement
from
observation
of
the
actual
conduct
of
mankind
nay
even
as
regards
the
positive
estimate
of
these
sources
of
happiness
we
find
on
closer
examination
that
the
supposed
is
much
less
clear
than
it
seemed
at
first
not
only
are
there
numerous
and
important
bodies
of
dissidents
from
the
current
opinions
but
the
very
same
majority
the
same
common
sense
of
mankind
that
maintains
these
opinions
is
found
in
a
singular
and
unexpected
manner
to
welcome
and
approve
the
paradoxes
of
these
dissidents
men
show
a
really
startling
readiness
to
admit
that
the
estimates
of
happiness
which
guide
them
in
their
ordinary
habits
and
pursuits
are
erroneous
and
illusory
and
that
from
time
to
time
the
veil
is
as
it
were
lifted
and
the
error
and
illusion
made
manifest
for
first
men
seem
to
attach
great
value
to
the
ample
gratification
of
bodily
appetites
and
needs
the
wealthier
part
of
mankind
spend
a
considerable
amount
of
money
and
forethought
upon
the
means
of
satisfying
these
in
a
luxurious
manner
and
though
they
do
not
often
deliberately
sacrifice
health
to
this
gratification
common
sense
condemns
that
as
irrational
still
one
may
say
that
they
are
habitually
courageous
in
pressing
forward
to
the
very
verge
of
this
imprudence
and
yet
the
same
people
are
fond
of
saying
that
hunger
is
the
best
sauce
and
that
temperance
and
labour
will
make
plain
food
more
delightful
than
the
most
exquisite
products
of
the
culinary
and
they
often
argue
with
perfect
sincerity
that
the
rich
have
really
no
advantage
or
scarcely
any
advantage
over
the
comparatively
poor
in
respect
of
these
pleasures
for
habit
soon
renders
the
more
luxurious
provision
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
acquired
needs
no
more
pleasant
to
the
rich
than
the
appeasing
of
his
more
primitive
appetites
is
to
the
poor
man
and
the
same
argument
is
often
extended
to
all
the
material
comforts
that
wealth
can
purchase
it
is
often
contended
that
habit
at
once
renders
us
indifferent
to
these
while
they
are
enjoyed
and
yet
unable
to
dispense
with
them
without
annoyance
so
that
the
pleasures
of
the
merely
animal
life
are
no
greater
to
the
rich
than
to
the
poor
but
only
more
insecure
and
from
this
there
is
but
a
short
step
to
the
conclusion
that
wealth
in
the
pursuit
of
which
most
men
agree
in
concentrating
their
efforts
and
on
the
attainment
of
which
all
congratulate
each
other
wealth
for
which
so
many
risk
their
health
shorten
their
lives
reduce
their
enjoyments
of
domestic
life
and
sacrifice
the
more
refined
pleasures
of
curiosity
and
art
is
really
a
very
doubtful
gain
in
the
majority
of
cases
because
the
cares
and
anxieties
which
it
entails
balance
for
most
men
the
slight
advantage
of
the
luxuries
which
it
purchases
and
similarly
although
social
rank
and
status
is
in
england
an
object
of
passionate
pursuit
yet
it
is
continually
said
with
general
approval
that
it
is
of
no
intrinsic
value
as
a
means
of
happiness
that
though
the
process
of
ascending
from
a
lower
grade
to
a
higher
is
perhaps
generally
agreeable
and
the
process
of
descending
from
a
higher
to
a
lower
certainly
painful
yet
permanent
existence
on
the
loftier
level
is
no
more
pleasant
than
on
the
humbler
that
happiness
is
to
be
found
as
easily
in
a
cottage
as
in
a
palace
if
not
indeed
more
easily
in
the
cottage
and
so
forth
still
more
trite
are
the
commonplaces
as
to
the
emptiness
and
vanity
of
the
satisfaction
to
be
derived
from
fame
and
reputation
the
case
of
posthumous
fame
indeed
is
a
striking
instance
of
the
general
proposition
before
laid
down
that
the
commonly
accepted
ends
of
action
are
determined
partly
by
the
average
force
of
desires
that
are
not
directed
towards
pleasure
nor
conformed
to
experiences
of
pleasure
for
posthumous
fame
seems
to
rank
pretty
high
among
the
objects
that
common
opinion
regards
as
good
or
desirable
for
the
individual
and
the
pursuit
of
it
is
not
ordinarily
stigmatised
as
contrary
to
prudence
even
if
it
leads
a
man
to
sacrifice
other
important
sources
of
happiness
to
a
result
of
which
he
never
expects
to
be
actually
conscious
yet
the
slightest
reflection
shows
such
a
pursuit
to
be
irrational
from
an
egoistic
point
of
view
and
every
moraliser
has
found
this
an
obvious
and
popular
topic
the
actual
consciousness
of
present
fame
is
no
doubt
very
delightful
to
most
persons
still
the
moraliser
does
not
find
it
difficult
to
maintain
that
even
this
is
attended
with
such
counterbalancing
disadvantages
as
render
its
hedonistic
value
very
doubtful
again
the
current
estimate
of
the
desirability
of
power
is
tolerably
high
and
perhaps
the
more
closely
and
analytically
we
examine
the
actual
motives
of
men
the
more
widespread
and
predominant
its
pursuit
will
appear
for
many
men
seem
to
seek
wealth
knowledge
even
reputation
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
power
rather
than
for
their
own
sakes
or
with
a
view
to
other
pleasures
and
yet
men
assent
willingly
when
they
are
told
that
the
pursuit
of
power
as
of
fame
is
prompted
by
a
vain
ambition
never
satisfied
but
only
rendered
more
uneasy
by
such
success
as
is
possible
for
it
that
the
anxieties
which
attend
not
only
the
pursuit
but
the
possession
of
power
and
the
jealousies
and
dangers
inseparable
from
the
latter
far
outweigh
its
pleasures
society
of
some
sort
no
one
can
deny
to
be
necessary
to
human
happiness
but
still
the
kind
and
degree
of
social
intercourse
which
is
actually
sought
by
the
more
wealthy
and
leisured
portion
of
the
community
with
no
little
expenditure
of
time
trouble
and
means
is
often
declared
to
yield
a
most
thin
and
meagre
result
of
pleasure
we
find
no
doubt
great
agreement
among
modern
moralisers
as
to
the
importance
of
the
exercise
of
the
domestic
affections
as
a
means
of
happiness
and
this
certainly
seems
to
have
a
prominent
place
in
the
plan
of
life
of
the
majority
of
mankind
and
yet
it
may
fairly
be
doubted
whether
men
in
general
do
value
domestic
life
very
highly
apart
from
the
gratification
of
sexual
passion
certainly
whenever
any
part
of
civilised
society
is
in
such
a
state
that
men
can
freely
indulge
this
passion
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
the
burden
of
a
family
without
any
serious
fear
of
social
disapprobation
celibacy
tends
to
become
common
it
has
even
become
so
common
as
to
excite
the
grave
anxiety
of
legislators
and
though
such
conduct
has
always
been
disapproved
by
common
sense
it
seems
to
be
rather
condemned
as
than
as
imprudent
thus
our
examination
shows
great
instability
and
uncertainty
in
the
most
decisive
judgments
of
common
sense
since
as
i
have
said
bodily
comfort
and
luxury
wealth
fame
power
society
are
the
objects
which
common
opinion
seems
most
clearly
and
confidently
to
recommend
as
sources
of
pleasure
for
though
the
pleasures
derived
from
art
and
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
in
nature
and
those
of
curiosity
and
the
exercise
of
the
intellect
generally
are
highly
praised
it
is
difficult
to
formulate
a
common
opinion
in
respect
of
them
since
the
high
estimates
often
set
upon
them
seem
to
express
the
real
experience
of
only
small
minorities
and
though
these
have
persuaded
the
mass
of
mankind
or
that
portion
of
it
which
is
possessed
of
leisure
to
let
culture
be
regarded
as
an
important
source
of
happiness
they
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
produced
any
generally
accepted
opinion
as
to
its
importance
in
comparison
with
the
other
sources
before
mentioned
the
pleasures
of
which
are
more
genuinely
appreciated
by
the
majority
still
less
as
to
the
relative
value
of
different
elements
of
this
culture
but
even
supposing
the
in
respect
of
sources
of
happiness
were
far
more
complete
and
clear
than
impartial
reflection
seems
to
show
its
value
would
still
be
considerably
impaired
by
the
dissent
of
important
minorities
which
we
have
not
yet
noticed
for
example
many
religious
persons
regard
all
mundane
pleasures
as
mean
and
trifling
so
full
of
vanity
and
emptiness
that
the
eager
pursuit
of
them
is
only
possible
through
illusion
leading
to
disappointment
and
this
view
is
shared
by
not
a
few
reflective
persons
who
have
no
religious
bias
as
is
evident
from
the
numerous
adherents
that
pessimism
has
won
in
recent
times
indeed
a
somewhat
similar
judgment
on
the
value
of
the
ordinary
objects
of
human
pursuit
has
been
passed
by
many
philosophers
who
have
not
been
pessimists
and
when
we
consider
that
it
is
the
philosopher
s
especial
business
to
reflect
with
care
and
precision
on
the
facts
of
consciousness
we
shall
hesitate
in
any
dispute
between
philosophers
and
the
mass
of
mankind
to
let
our
conclusion
be
determined
by
merely
counting
heads
on
the
other
hand
as
has
been
already
observed
the
philosopher
s
susceptibilities
and
capacities
of
feeling
do
not
fairly
represent
those
of
humanity
in
general
and
hence
if
he
ventures
to
erect
the
results
of
his
individual
experience
into
a
universal
standard
he
is
likely
to
overrate
some
pleasures
and
underrate
others
perhaps
the
most
convincing
illustrations
of
this
are
furnished
by
thinkers
not
of
the
idealist
or
transcendental
type
but
professed
hedonists
such
as
epicurus
and
hobbes
we
can
not
accept
as
fair
expressions
of
the
ordinary
experience
of
the
human
race
either
epicurus
s
identification
of
painlessness
with
the
highest
degree
of
pleasure
or
hobbes
s
asseveration
that
the
gratifications
of
curiosity
far
exceed
in
intensity
all
carnal
thus
we
seem
to
be
in
this
dilemma
the
mass
of
mankind
to
whose
common
opinion
we
are
naturally
referred
for
catholically
authoritative
beliefs
respecting
the
conditions
of
happiness
are
deficient
in
the
faculty
or
the
habit
of
observing
and
recording
their
experience
and
usually
in
proportion
as
a
man
is
by
nature
and
practice
a
better
observer
the
phenomena
that
he
has
to
observe
are
more
and
more
divergent
from
the
ordinary
type
on
the
whole
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
hedonistic
method
can
not
be
freed
from
inexactness
and
uncertainty
by
appealing
to
the
judgments
of
common
sense
respecting
the
sources
of
happiness
at
the
same
time
i
would
not
exaggerate
the
difficulty
of
combining
these
into
a
tolerably
coherent
body
of
probable
doctrine
not
useless
for
practical
guidance
for
first
it
must
be
observed
that
it
is
only
occasionally
and
to
a
limited
extent
that
these
commonly
commended
sources
of
happiness
come
into
competition
with
one
another
and
are
presented
as
alternatives
for
example
the
pursuit
of
wealth
often
leads
also
to
power
besides
the
power
that
lies
in
wealth
and
to
reputation
and
again
these
objects
of
desire
can
usually
be
best
attained
as
far
as
it
is
in
our
power
to
attain
them
at
all
by
employment
which
in
itself
gives
the
pleasure
that
normally
attends
energetic
exercise
of
one
s
best
faculties
and
this
congenial
employment
is
not
incompatible
with
adequate
exercise
of
the
affections
social
and
domestic
nor
with
cultivated
amusement
which
must
always
be
carefully
limited
in
amount
if
it
is
to
be
really
amusing
and
no
one
doubts
that
to
carry
either
employment
or
amusement
to
a
degree
that
injures
health
involves
generally
a
sacrifice
of
happiness
no
less
than
in
sensual
gratifications
and
as
for
the
philosophical
or
paradoxes
as
to
the
illusoriness
of
sensual
enjoyments
wealth
power
fame
we
may
explain
the
widespread
acceptance
which
these
find
by
admitting
a
certain
general
tendency
to
exaggeration
in
the
common
estimates
of
such
objects
of
desire
which
from
time
to
time
causes
a
reaction
and
an
equally
excessive
temporary
depreciation
of
them
as
we
saw
chap
iii
it
is
natural
for
men
to
value
too
highly
the
absent
pleasures
for
which
they
hope
and
long
power
and
fame
for
example
are
certainly
attended
with
anxieties
and
disgusts
which
are
not
foreseen
when
they
are
represented
in
longing
imagination
yet
it
may
still
be
true
that
they
bring
to
most
men
a
clear
balance
of
happiness
on
the
whole
it
seems
clear
again
that
luxury
adds
to
the
ordinary
enjoyment
of
life
than
most
men
struggling
with
penury
suppose
there
are
special
delights
attending
the
meal
and
the
amusement
which
must
be
weighed
against
the
profuser
pleasures
that
the
rich
can
command
so
that
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
increase
of
happiness
is
very
far
from
keeping
pace
with
increase
of
wealth
on
the
other
hand
when
we
take
into
account
all
the
pleasures
of
culture
power
fame
and
beneficence
and
still
more
the
security
that
wealth
gives
against
the
pains
of
privation
and
the
anxieties
of
penury
for
the
owner
himself
and
those
whom
he
loves
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
increase
of
wealth
brings
on
the
average
increase
of
happiness
at
least
until
a
man
reaches
an
income
beyond
that
of
the
great
majority
in
any
actual
community
thus
on
the
whole
it
would
seem
to
be
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
while
it
is
extravagant
to
affirm
that
happiness
is
equally
distributed
through
all
ranks
and
callings
it
is
yet
equally
distributed
than
the
aspect
of
men
s
external
circumstances
would
lead
us
to
infer
especially
considering
the
importance
of
the
pleasures
that
attend
the
exercise
of
the
affections
again
common
sense
is
quite
prepared
to
recognise
that
there
are
persons
of
peculiar
temperament
to
whom
the
ordinary
pleasures
of
life
are
really
quite
trifling
in
comparison
with
more
refined
enjoyments
and
also
that
men
generally
are
liable
to
fall
for
certain
periods
under
the
sway
of
absorbing
impulses
which
take
them
out
of
the
range
within
which
the
judgments
of
common
sense
are
even
broadly
and
generally
valid
no
one
expects
a
lover
to
care
much
for
anything
except
the
enjoyments
of
love
nor
considers
that
an
enthusiast
sacrifices
happiness
in
making
everything
give
way
to
his
hobby
in
fact
we
may
say
that
common
sense
scarcely
claims
to
provide
more
than
rather
indefinite
general
rules
which
no
prudent
man
should
neglect
without
giving
himself
a
reason
for
doing
so
such
reasons
may
either
be
drawn
from
one
s
knowledge
of
some
peculiarities
in
one
s
nature
or
from
the
experience
of
others
whom
one
has
ground
for
believing
to
be
more
like
oneself
than
the
average
of
mankind
are
still
as
we
saw
there
is
considerable
risk
of
error
in
thus
appropriating
the
special
experience
of
other
individuals
and
in
short
it
does
not
appear
that
by
any
process
of
this
kind
either
by
appealing
to
the
common
opinion
of
the
many
or
to
that
of
cultivated
persons
or
to
that
of
those
whom
we
judge
most
to
resemble
ourselves
we
can
hope
to
solve
with
precision
or
certainty
the
problems
of
egoistic
conduct
the
question
then
remains
whether
any
general
theory
can
be
attained
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
so
certain
and
practically
applicable
that
we
may
by
its
aid
rise
above
the
ambiguities
and
inconsistencies
of
common
or
sectarian
opinion
no
less
than
the
shortcomings
of
the
method
and
establish
the
hedonistic
art
of
life
on
a
thoroughly
scientific
basis
to
the
consideration
of
this
question
i
shall
proceed
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
book
but
before
entering
upon
it
i
wish
to
examine
carefully
a
common
belief
as
to
the
means
of
attaining
happiness
which
though
it
hardly
claims
to
rest
upon
a
scientific
basis
is
yet
generally
conceived
by
those
who
hold
it
to
have
a
higher
degree
of
certainty
than
most
of
the
current
opinions
that
we
have
been
examining
this
is
the
belief
that
a
man
will
attain
the
greatest
happiness
open
to
him
by
the
performance
of
his
duty
as
commonly
recognised
and
prescribed
except
so
far
as
he
may
deviate
from
this
standard
in
obedience
to
a
truer
conception
of
the
conduct
by
which
universal
good
is
to
be
realised
or
promoted
the
special
importance
of
this
opinion
to
a
writer
on
morals
renders
it
desirable
to
reserve
our
discussion
of
it
for
a
separate
chapter
footnotes
the
consideration
of
the
importance
of
morality
as
a
source
of
happiness
is
reserved
for
the
next
chapter
it
is
striking
to
find
the
author
of
the
of
the
founder
of
a
long
line
of
plutologists
who
are
commonly
believed
to
exalt
the
material
means
of
happiness
above
all
other
declaring
that
wealth
and
greatness
are
mere
trinkets
of
frivolous
utility
and
that
in
ease
of
body
and
peace
of
mind
all
the
different
ranks
of
life
are
nearly
upon
a
level
and
the
beggar
who
suns
himself
by
the
side
of
the
highway
possesses
that
security
which
kings
are
fighting
adam
smith
part
iv
chap
i
no
doubt
such
a
pursuit
may
be
justified
to
by
dwelling
on
the
pleasures
of
hope
and
anticipation
which
attend
it
but
this
is
obviously
an
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
these
originally
that
posthumous
fame
is
sought
by
him
whom
it
spurs
to
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
in
the
following
chapter
i
have
not
entered
into
any
particular
consideration
of
the
case
in
which
the
individual
s
conscience
is
definitely
in
conflict
with
the
general
moral
consciousness
of
his
age
and
country
because
though
it
is
commonly
held
to
be
a
man
s
duty
always
to
obey
the
dictates
of
his
own
conscience
even
at
the
risk
of
error
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
current
opinion
that
he
will
always
attain
the
greatest
happiness
open
to
him
by
conforming
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
even
when
it
conflicts
with
received
morality
chapter
v
happiness
and
duty
the
belief
in
the
connexion
of
happiness
with
duty
is
one
to
which
we
find
a
general
tendency
among
civilised
men
at
least
after
a
certain
stage
in
civilisation
has
been
reached
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
affirmed
among
ourselves
as
a
generalisation
from
experience
and
not
rather
as
a
matter
of
direct
divine
revelation
or
an
inevitable
inference
from
the
belief
that
the
world
is
governed
by
a
perfectly
good
and
omnipotent
being
to
examine
thoroughly
the
validity
of
the
latter
belief
is
one
of
the
most
important
tasks
that
human
reason
can
attempt
but
involving
as
it
does
an
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
evidences
of
natural
and
revealed
religion
it
could
hardly
be
included
within
the
scope
of
the
present
treatise
here
then
i
shall
only
consider
the
coincidence
of
duty
and
happiness
in
so
far
as
it
is
maintained
by
arguments
drawn
from
experience
and
supposed
to
be
realised
in
our
present
earthly
life
perhaps
as
so
restricted
the
coincidence
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
currently
believed
indeed
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
opposite
belief
is
implied
in
the
general
admission
of
the
necessity
of
rewards
and
punishments
in
a
future
state
in
order
to
exhibit
and
realise
completely
the
moral
government
of
the
world
but
reflection
will
show
that
this
implication
is
not
necessary
for
it
is
possible
to
hold
that
even
here
virtue
is
always
rewarded
and
vice
punished
so
far
as
to
make
the
virtuous
course
of
action
always
the
most
prudent
while
yet
the
rewards
and
punishments
are
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
our
sense
of
justice
admitting
that
the
virtuous
man
is
often
placed
on
earth
in
circumstances
so
adverse
that
his
life
is
not
as
happy
as
that
of
many
less
virtuous
it
is
still
possible
to
maintain
that
by
virtue
he
will
gain
the
maximum
of
happiness
that
can
be
gained
under
these
circumstances
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
and
this
view
has
certainly
been
held
by
moralists
of
reputation
on
grounds
drawn
from
actual
experience
of
human
life
and
seems
often
to
be
confidently
put
forward
on
similar
grounds
by
popular
preachers
and
moralisers
it
appears
therefore
desirable
to
subject
this
opinion
to
a
careful
and
impartial
examination
in
conducting
this
examination
at
the
present
stage
of
our
inquiry
we
shall
have
to
use
the
received
notions
of
duty
without
further
definition
or
analysis
but
it
is
commonly
assumed
by
those
whose
view
we
are
to
examine
that
these
conceptions
as
they
are
found
in
the
moral
consciousness
of
ordinary
persons
are
at
least
approximately
valid
and
trustworthy
and
the
preceding
chapters
will
have
fully
shown
that
the
generalisations
of
hedonism
must
be
established
if
at
all
by
large
considerations
and
decisive
preponderances
and
that
it
would
be
idle
in
considering
a
question
of
this
kind
to
take
account
of
slight
differences
and
to
pretend
to
weigh
in
our
mental
scales
comparatively
small
portions
of
happiness
accepting
then
the
common
division
of
duties
into
and
social
it
may
be
conceded
that
as
far
as
the
first
are
concerned
the
view
that
we
are
examining
is
not
likely
to
provoke
any
controversy
for
by
duties
towards
oneself
are
commonly
meant
acts
that
tend
directly
or
indirectly
to
promote
one
s
happiness
we
may
therefore
confine
our
attention
to
the
social
department
of
duty
and
consider
whether
by
observing
the
moral
rules
that
prescribe
certain
modes
of
behaviour
towards
others
we
shall
always
tend
to
secure
the
greatest
balance
of
happiness
to
ourselves
here
it
will
be
convenient
to
adopt
with
some
modification
the
terminology
of
bentham
and
to
regard
the
pleasures
consequent
on
conformity
to
moral
rules
and
the
pains
consequent
on
their
violation
as
the
sanctions
of
these
rules
these
sanctions
we
may
classify
as
external
and
internal
the
former
class
will
include
both
legal
sanctions
or
penalties
inflicted
by
the
authority
direct
or
indirect
of
the
sovereign
and
social
sanctions
which
are
either
the
pleasures
that
may
be
expected
from
the
approval
and
goodwill
of
our
generally
and
the
services
that
they
will
be
prompted
to
render
both
by
this
goodwill
and
by
their
appreciation
of
the
usefulness
of
good
conduct
or
the
annoyance
and
losses
that
are
to
be
feared
from
their
distrust
and
dislike
the
internal
sanctions
of
duty
so
far
as
it
diverges
from
the
conduct
which
apart
from
morality
would
dictate
will
lie
in
the
pleasurable
emotion
attending
virtuous
action
or
in
the
absence
of
remorse
or
will
result
more
indirectly
from
some
effect
on
the
mental
constitution
of
the
agent
produced
by
the
maintenance
of
virtuous
dispositions
and
habits
this
classification
is
important
for
our
present
purpose
chiefly
because
the
systems
of
rules
to
which
these
different
sanctions
are
respectively
attached
may
be
mutually
conflicting
the
positive
morality
of
any
community
undergoes
development
and
is
thus
subject
to
changes
which
affect
the
consciences
of
the
few
before
they
are
accepted
by
the
many
so
that
the
rules
at
any
time
sustained
by
the
strongest
social
sanctions
may
not
only
fall
short
of
but
even
clash
with
the
intuitions
of
those
members
of
the
community
who
have
most
moral
insight
for
similar
reasons
law
and
positive
morality
may
be
at
variance
in
details
for
though
a
law
could
not
long
exist
which
it
was
universally
thought
wrong
to
obey
there
may
easily
be
laws
commanding
conduct
that
is
considered
immoral
by
some
more
or
less
enlightened
fraction
of
the
community
especially
by
some
sect
or
party
that
has
a
public
opinion
of
its
own
and
any
individual
may
be
so
much
more
closely
connected
with
this
fraction
than
with
the
rest
of
the
community
that
the
social
sanction
may
in
his
case
practically
operate
against
the
legal
this
conflict
of
sanctions
is
of
great
importance
in
considering
whether
these
sanctions
as
at
present
capable
of
being
foreseen
are
sufficient
in
all
cases
to
determine
a
rational
egoist
to
the
performance
of
social
duty
for
the
more
stress
we
lay
on
either
the
legal
or
the
social
sanctions
of
moral
conduct
the
greater
difficulty
we
shall
have
in
proving
the
coincidence
of
duty
and
in
the
exceptional
cases
in
which
we
find
these
sanctions
arrayed
against
what
we
conceive
to
be
duty
but
even
if
we
put
these
cases
out
of
sight
it
still
seems
clear
that
the
external
sanctions
of
morality
alone
are
not
always
sufficient
to
render
immoral
conduct
also
imprudent
we
must
indeed
admit
that
in
an
even
tolerably
society
in
an
ordinary
civilised
community
in
its
normal
condition
all
serious
open
violation
of
law
is
contrary
to
prudence
unless
it
is
an
incident
in
a
successful
process
of
violent
revolution
and
further
that
violent
revolutions
would
very
rarely
perhaps
never
be
made
by
a
combination
of
persons
all
perfectly
under
the
control
of
enlightened
on
account
of
the
general
and
widespread
destruction
of
security
and
of
other
means
of
happiness
which
such
disturbances
inevitably
involve
still
so
long
as
actual
human
beings
are
not
all
rational
egoists
such
times
of
disorder
will
be
liable
to
occur
and
we
can
not
say
that
existing
it
is
a
clear
universal
precept
of
rational
that
a
man
should
seek
peace
and
ensue
it
since
the
disturbance
of
political
order
may
offer
to
a
cool
and
skilful
person
who
has
the
art
of
fishing
in
troubled
waters
opportunities
of
gaining
wealth
fame
and
power
far
beyond
what
he
could
hope
for
in
peaceful
times
in
short
though
we
may
admit
that
a
society
composed
entirely
of
rational
egoists
would
when
once
organised
tend
to
remain
in
a
stable
and
orderly
condition
it
does
not
follow
that
any
individual
rational
egoist
will
always
be
on
the
side
of
order
in
any
existing
community
but
at
any
rate
in
the
most
orderly
societies
with
which
we
are
acquainted
the
administration
of
law
and
justice
is
never
in
so
perfect
a
state
as
to
render
crimes
always
acts
of
folly
on
the
score
of
the
legal
penalties
attached
to
them
for
however
much
these
may
outweigh
the
advantages
of
crime
cases
must
inevitably
occur
in
which
the
risk
of
discovery
is
so
small
that
on
a
sober
calculation
the
almost
certain
gain
will
more
than
compensate
for
the
slight
chance
of
the
penalty
and
finally
in
no
community
is
the
law
actually
in
so
perfect
a
state
that
there
are
not
certain
kinds
of
flagrantly
conduct
which
slip
through
its
meshes
and
escape
legal
penalties
altogether
or
incur
only
such
legal
penalties
as
are
outweighed
by
the
profit
of
let
us
proceed
then
to
consider
how
far
the
social
sanction
in
such
cases
supplies
the
defects
of
the
legal
no
doubt
the
hope
of
praise
and
liking
and
services
from
one
s
and
the
fear
of
forfeiting
these
and
incurring
instead
aversion
refusal
of
aid
and
social
exclusion
are
considerations
often
important
enough
to
determine
the
rational
egoist
to
even
in
default
of
adequate
legal
penalties
still
these
sanctions
are
liable
to
fail
just
where
the
legal
penalties
are
defective
social
no
less
than
legal
penalties
are
evaded
by
secret
crimes
and
in
cases
of
criminal
revolutionary
violence
the
efficacy
of
the
social
sanction
is
apt
to
be
seriously
impaired
by
the
party
spirit
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
criminal
for
it
has
to
be
observed
that
the
force
of
the
social
sanction
diminishes
very
rapidly
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
dissidents
from
the
common
opinion
that
awards
it
disapprobation
that
is
at
once
intense
and
quite
universal
would
be
so
severe
a
penalty
as
perhaps
to
outweigh
any
imaginable
advantages
since
it
seems
impossible
for
a
human
being
to
live
happily
whatever
other
goods
he
may
enjoy
without
the
kindly
regards
of
some
of
his
fellows
and
so
in
contemplating
the
conventional
portrait
of
the
tyrant
who
is
represented
as
necessarily
suspicious
of
those
nearest
him
even
of
the
members
of
his
own
family
we
feel
prepared
to
admit
that
such
a
life
must
involve
the
extreme
of
unhappiness
but
when
we
turn
to
contemplate
the
actual
tyrannical
usurpers
wicked
statesmen
successful
leaders
of
unwarranted
rebellion
and
speaking
generally
the
great
criminals
whose
position
raises
them
out
of
the
reach
of
legal
penalties
it
does
not
appear
that
the
moral
odium
under
which
they
lie
must
necessarily
count
for
much
in
an
egoistic
calculation
of
the
gain
and
loss
resulting
from
their
conduct
for
this
disesteem
is
only
expressed
by
a
portion
of
the
community
and
its
utterance
is
often
drowned
in
the
applause
of
the
multitude
whose
admiration
is
largely
independent
of
moral
considerations
nor
are
there
wanting
philosophers
and
historians
whose
judgment
manifests
a
similar
independence
it
seems
then
impossible
to
affirm
that
the
external
sanctions
of
men
s
legal
duties
will
always
be
sufficient
to
identify
duty
with
interest
and
a
corresponding
assertion
would
be
still
more
unwarranted
in
respect
of
moral
duties
not
included
within
the
sphere
of
law
in
saying
this
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
force
of
what
may
be
called
the
principle
of
reciprocity
by
which
certain
utilitarians
have
endeavoured
to
prove
the
coincidence
of
any
individual
s
interest
with
his
social
duties
virtues
they
say
are
qualities
either
useful
or
directly
agreeable
to
others
thus
they
either
increase
the
market
value
of
the
virtuous
man
s
services
and
cause
others
to
purchase
them
at
a
higher
rate
and
to
allot
to
him
more
dignified
and
interesting
functions
or
they
dispose
men
to
please
him
both
out
of
gratitude
and
in
order
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
his
society
in
return
and
again
since
man
is
an
imitative
animal
the
exhibition
of
these
qualities
is
naturally
rewarded
by
a
reciprocal
manifestation
of
them
on
the
part
of
others
through
the
mere
influence
of
example
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
prospect
of
these
advantages
is
an
adequate
motive
for
cultivating
many
virtues
and
avoiding
much
vice
thus
on
such
grounds
a
rational
egoist
will
generally
be
strict
and
punctual
in
the
fulfilment
of
all
his
engagements
and
truthful
in
his
assertions
in
order
to
win
the
confidence
of
other
men
and
he
will
be
zealous
and
industrious
in
his
work
in
order
to
obtain
gradually
more
important
and
therefore
more
honourable
and
lucrative
employment
and
he
will
control
such
of
his
passions
and
appetites
as
are
likely
to
interfere
with
his
efficiency
and
will
not
exhibit
violent
anger
or
use
unnecessary
harshness
even
towards
servants
and
subordinates
and
towards
his
equals
and
superiors
in
rank
he
will
be
generally
polite
and
complaisant
and
and
prompt
to
show
them
all
such
kindness
as
costs
but
little
in
proportion
to
the
pleasure
it
gives
still
reflection
seems
to
show
that
the
conduct
recommended
by
this
line
of
reasoning
does
not
really
coincide
with
moral
duty
for
first
what
one
requires
for
social
success
is
that
one
should
rather
than
useful
to
others
and
hence
this
motive
will
not
restrain
one
from
doing
secret
harm
to
others
or
even
from
acting
openly
in
a
way
that
is
really
harmful
though
not
perceived
to
be
so
and
again
a
man
is
not
useful
to
others
by
his
virtue
only
but
sometimes
rather
by
his
vice
or
more
often
by
a
certain
admixture
of
unscrupulousness
with
his
good
and
useful
qualities
and
further
morality
prescribes
the
performance
of
duties
equally
towards
all
and
that
we
should
abstain
as
far
as
possible
from
harming
any
but
on
the
principle
of
reciprocity
we
should
exhibit
our
useful
qualities
chiefly
towards
the
rich
and
powerful
and
abstain
from
injuring
those
who
can
retaliate
while
we
may
reasonably
omit
our
duties
to
the
poor
and
feeble
if
we
find
a
material
advantage
in
so
doing
unless
they
are
able
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
persons
who
can
harm
us
moreover
some
vices
as
for
example
many
kinds
of
sensuality
and
extravagant
luxury
do
not
inflict
any
immediate
or
obvious
injury
on
any
individual
though
they
tend
in
the
to
impair
the
general
happiness
hence
few
persons
find
themselves
strongly
moved
to
check
or
punish
this
kind
of
mischief
doubtless
in
the
cases
the
mere
disrepute
inevitably
attaching
to
open
immorality
is
an
important
consideration
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
will
be
seriously
maintained
to
be
sufficient
always
to
turn
the
scales
of
prudence
against
vice
at
least
by
any
one
who
has
duly
analysed
the
turbid
and
fluctuating
streams
of
social
opinion
upon
which
the
good
or
ill
repute
of
individuals
mainly
depends
and
considered
the
conflicting
and
divergent
elements
that
they
contain
many
moralists
have
noticed
the
discrepancy
in
modern
europe
between
the
law
of
honour
or
the
more
important
rules
maintained
by
the
social
sanction
of
polite
persons
and
the
morality
professed
in
society
at
large
this
is
however
by
no
means
the
only
instance
of
a
special
code
divergent
in
certain
points
from
the
moral
rules
generally
accepted
in
the
community
where
it
exists
most
religious
sects
and
parties
and
probably
the
majority
of
trades
and
professions
exhibit
this
phenomenon
in
some
degree
i
do
not
mean
merely
that
special
rules
of
behaviour
are
imposed
upon
members
of
each
profession
corresponding
to
their
special
social
functions
and
relations
i
mean
that
a
peculiar
moral
opinion
is
apt
to
grow
up
conflicting
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
opinion
of
the
general
public
the
most
striking
part
of
this
divergence
consists
generally
in
the
approval
or
excusal
of
practices
disapproved
by
the
current
morality
as
licence
among
soldiers
bribery
among
politicians
in
certain
ages
and
countries
unveracity
of
various
degrees
among
priests
and
advocates
fraud
in
different
forms
among
tradesmen
in
such
cases
there
are
generally
strong
natural
inducements
to
disobey
the
stricter
rule
in
fact
it
would
seem
to
be
to
the
continual
pressure
of
these
inducements
that
the
relaxation
of
the
rule
has
been
due
while
at
the
same
time
the
social
sanction
is
weakened
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
say
whether
it
outweighs
a
similar
force
on
the
other
side
for
a
man
who
under
these
circumstances
conforms
to
the
stricter
rule
if
he
does
not
actually
meet
with
contempt
and
aversion
from
those
of
his
calling
is
at
least
liable
to
be
called
eccentric
and
fantastic
and
this
is
still
more
the
case
if
by
such
conformity
he
foregoes
advantages
not
only
to
himself
but
to
his
relatives
or
friends
or
party
very
often
this
professional
or
sectarian
excusal
of
immorality
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
not
so
clear
and
explicit
as
to
amount
to
the
establishment
of
a
rule
conflicting
with
the
generally
received
rule
but
is
still
sufficient
to
weaken
indefinitely
the
social
sanction
in
favour
of
the
latter
and
apart
from
these
special
divergences
we
may
say
generally
that
in
most
civilised
societies
there
are
two
different
degrees
of
positive
morality
both
maintained
in
some
sort
by
common
consent
a
stricter
code
being
publicly
taught
and
avowed
while
a
laxer
set
of
rules
is
privately
admitted
as
the
only
code
which
can
be
supported
by
social
sanctions
of
any
great
force
by
refusing
to
conform
to
the
stricter
code
a
man
is
often
not
liable
to
incur
exclusion
from
social
intercourse
or
any
material
hindrance
to
professional
advancement
or
even
serious
dislike
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
persons
whose
society
he
will
most
naturally
seek
and
under
such
circumstances
the
mere
loss
of
a
certain
amount
of
reputation
is
not
likely
to
be
felt
as
a
very
grave
evil
except
by
persons
peculiarly
sensitive
to
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
reputation
and
there
would
seem
to
be
many
men
whose
happiness
does
not
depend
on
the
approbation
or
disapprobation
of
the
moralist
and
of
mankind
in
general
in
so
far
as
they
support
the
moralist
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
it
prudent
for
them
to
purchase
this
praise
by
any
great
sacrifice
of
other
goods
we
must
conclude
then
that
if
the
conduct
prescribed
to
the
individual
by
the
avowedly
accepted
morality
of
the
community
of
which
he
is
a
member
can
be
shown
to
coincide
with
that
to
which
rational
would
prompt
it
must
be
in
many
cases
solely
or
chiefly
on
the
score
of
the
internal
sanctions
in
considering
the
force
of
these
sanctions
i
shall
eliminate
those
pleasures
and
pains
which
lie
in
the
anticipation
of
rewards
and
punishments
in
a
future
life
for
as
we
are
now
supposing
the
calculations
of
rational
egoism
to
be
performed
without
taking
into
account
any
feelings
that
are
beyond
the
range
of
experience
it
will
be
more
consistent
to
exclude
also
the
pleasurable
or
painful
anticipations
of
such
feelings
let
us
then
contemplate
by
itself
the
satisfaction
that
attends
the
performance
of
duty
as
such
without
taking
into
consideration
any
ulterior
consequences
and
the
pain
that
follows
on
its
violation
after
the
discussions
of
the
two
preceding
chapters
i
shall
not
of
course
attempt
to
weigh
exactly
these
pleasures
and
pains
against
others
but
i
see
no
empirical
grounds
for
believing
that
such
feelings
are
always
sufficiently
intense
to
turn
the
balance
of
prospective
happiness
in
favour
of
morality
this
will
hardly
be
denied
if
the
question
is
raised
in
respect
of
isolated
acts
of
duty
let
us
take
an
extreme
case
which
is
yet
quite
within
the
limits
of
experience
the
call
of
duty
has
often
impelled
a
soldier
or
other
public
servant
or
the
adherent
of
a
persecuted
religion
to
face
certain
and
painful
death
under
circumstances
where
it
might
be
avoided
with
little
or
no
loss
even
of
reputation
to
prove
such
conduct
always
reasonable
from
an
egoistic
point
of
view
we
have
to
assume
that
in
all
cases
where
such
a
duty
could
exist
and
be
recognised
the
mere
pain
that
would
follow
on
evasion
of
duty
would
be
so
great
as
to
render
the
whole
remainder
of
life
hedonistically
worthless
surely
such
an
assumption
would
be
paradoxical
and
extravagant
nothing
that
we
know
of
the
majority
of
persons
in
any
society
would
lead
us
to
conclude
that
their
moral
feelings
taken
alone
form
so
preponderant
an
element
of
their
happiness
and
a
similar
conclusion
seems
irresistible
even
in
more
ordinary
cases
where
a
man
is
called
on
to
give
up
for
virtue
s
sake
not
life
but
a
considerable
share
of
the
ordinary
sources
of
human
happiness
can
we
say
that
all
or
even
most
men
are
so
constituted
that
the
satisfactions
of
a
good
conscience
are
certain
to
repay
them
for
such
sacrifices
or
that
the
pain
and
loss
involved
in
them
would
certainly
be
outweighed
by
the
remorse
that
would
follow
the
refusal
to
make
them
perhaps
however
so
much
as
this
has
scarcely
ever
been
expressly
maintained
what
plato
in
his
and
other
writers
on
the
same
side
have
rather
tried
to
prove
is
not
that
at
any
particular
moment
duty
will
be
to
every
one
on
whom
it
may
devolve
productive
of
more
happiness
than
any
other
course
of
conduct
but
rather
that
it
is
every
one
s
interest
on
the
whole
to
choose
the
life
of
the
virtuous
man
but
even
this
it
is
very
difficult
even
to
render
probable
as
will
appear
i
think
if
we
examine
the
lines
of
reasoning
by
which
it
is
commonly
supported
to
begin
with
plato
s
argument
he
represents
the
soul
of
the
virtuous
man
as
a
polity
of
impulses
in
which
every
passion
and
appetite
is
duly
obedient
to
the
rightful
sovereignty
of
reason
and
operates
only
within
the
limits
laid
down
by
the
latter
he
then
contrasts
the
tranquil
peace
of
such
a
mind
with
the
disorder
of
one
where
a
succession
of
baser
impulses
or
some
ruling
passion
lords
it
over
reason
and
asks
which
is
the
happiest
even
apart
from
external
rewards
and
punishments
but
we
may
grant
all
that
plato
claims
and
yet
be
no
further
advanced
towards
the
solution
of
the
question
before
us
for
here
the
issue
does
not
lie
between
reason
and
passion
but
rather
in
butler
s
language
between
rational
and
conscience
we
are
supposing
the
egoist
to
have
all
his
impulses
under
control
and
are
only
asking
how
this
control
is
to
be
exercised
now
we
have
seen
that
the
regulation
and
organisation
of
life
best
calculated
to
attain
the
end
of
appears
divergent
at
certain
points
from
that
to
which
men
in
general
are
prompted
by
a
sense
of
duty
in
order
to
maintain
plato
s
position
it
has
to
be
shown
that
this
appearance
is
false
and
that
a
system
of
which
under
certain
circumstances
leads
us
to
pain
loss
and
death
is
still
that
which
requires
it
can
scarcely
be
said
that
our
nature
is
such
that
only
this
kind
of
regulation
is
possible
that
the
choice
lies
between
this
and
none
at
all
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
rational
egoist
strictly
controlling
each
of
his
passions
and
impulses
including
his
social
sentiments
within
such
limits
that
its
indulgence
should
not
involve
the
sacrifice
of
some
greater
gratification
and
experience
seems
to
show
us
many
examples
of
persons
who
at
least
approximate
as
closely
to
this
type
as
any
one
else
does
to
the
ideal
of
the
orthodox
moralist
hence
if
the
regulation
of
conscience
be
demonstrably
the
best
means
to
the
individual
s
happiness
it
must
be
because
the
order
kept
by
involves
a
sacrifice
of
pleasure
on
the
whole
as
compared
with
the
order
kept
by
conscience
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
would
seem
that
it
can
only
be
on
account
of
the
special
emotional
pleasure
attending
the
satisfaction
of
the
moral
sentiments
or
special
pain
or
loss
of
happiness
consequent
on
their
repression
and
violation
before
however
we
proceed
further
a
fundamental
difficulty
must
be
removed
which
has
probably
some
time
since
suggested
itself
to
the
reader
if
a
man
thinks
it
reasonable
to
seek
his
own
interest
it
is
clear
that
he
can
not
himself
disapprove
of
any
conduct
that
comes
under
this
principle
or
approve
of
the
opposite
and
hence
it
may
appear
that
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
conscience
can
not
enter
into
the
calculation
whether
a
certain
course
of
conduct
is
or
is
not
in
accordance
with
rational
egoism
because
they
can
not
attach
themselves
in
the
egoist
s
mind
to
any
modes
of
action
which
have
not
been
already
decided
on
other
grounds
to
be
reasonable
or
the
reverse
and
this
is
to
a
certain
extent
true
but
we
must
here
recur
to
the
distinction
indicated
in
book
chap
iii
between
the
general
impulse
to
do
what
we
believe
to
be
reasonable
and
special
sentiments
of
liking
or
aversion
for
special
kinds
of
conduct
independent
of
their
reasonableness
in
the
moral
sentiments
as
they
exist
in
ordinary
men
these
two
kinds
of
feeling
are
indistinguishably
blended
because
it
is
commonly
believed
that
the
rules
of
conduct
to
which
the
common
moral
sentiments
are
attached
are
in
some
way
or
other
reasonable
we
can
however
conceive
the
two
separated
and
in
fact
as
was
before
said
we
have
experience
of
such
separation
whenever
a
man
is
led
by
a
process
of
thought
to
adopt
a
different
view
of
morality
from
that
in
which
he
has
been
trained
for
in
such
a
case
there
will
always
remain
in
his
mind
some
likings
and
aversions
no
longer
sustained
by
his
deliberate
judgment
of
right
and
wrong
and
thus
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
most
men
however
firmly
they
might
adopt
the
principles
of
egoistic
hedonism
would
still
feel
sentiments
prompting
to
the
performance
of
social
duty
as
commonly
recognised
in
their
society
independently
of
any
conclusion
that
the
actions
prompted
by
such
sentiments
were
reasonable
and
right
for
such
sentiments
would
always
be
powerfully
supported
by
the
sympathy
of
others
and
their
expressions
of
praise
and
blame
liking
and
aversion
and
since
it
is
agreed
that
the
conduct
commonly
recognised
as
virtuous
is
coincident
with
that
which
enlightened
would
dictate
a
rational
egoist
s
habits
of
conduct
will
be
such
as
naturally
to
foster
these
for
him
feelings
the
question
therefore
arises
not
whether
the
egoist
should
cherish
and
indulge
these
sentiments
up
to
a
certain
point
which
all
would
admit
but
whether
he
can
consistently
encourage
them
to
grow
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
will
always
prevail
over
the
strongest
opposing
considerations
or
to
put
it
otherwise
whether
prudence
requires
him
to
give
them
the
rein
and
let
them
carry
him
whither
they
will
we
have
already
seen
ground
for
believing
that
rational
will
best
attain
its
end
by
limiting
its
conscious
operation
and
allowing
free
play
to
disinterested
impulses
can
we
accept
the
further
paradox
that
it
is
reasonable
for
it
to
abdicate
altogether
its
supremacy
over
some
of
these
impulses
on
a
careful
consideration
of
the
matter
it
will
appear
i
think
that
this
abdication
of
is
not
really
a
possible
occurrence
in
the
mind
of
a
sane
person
who
still
regards
his
own
interest
as
the
reasonable
ultimate
end
of
his
actions
such
a
man
may
no
doubt
resolve
that
he
will
devote
himself
unreservedly
to
the
practice
of
virtue
without
any
particular
consideration
of
what
appears
to
him
to
be
his
interest
he
may
perform
a
series
of
acts
in
accordance
with
this
resolution
and
these
may
gradually
form
in
him
strong
habitual
tendencies
to
acts
of
a
similar
kind
but
it
does
not
seem
that
these
habits
of
virtue
can
ever
become
so
strong
as
to
gain
irresistible
control
over
a
sane
and
reasonable
will
when
the
occasion
comes
on
which
virtue
demands
from
such
a
man
an
extreme
sacrifice
the
imprudence
of
which
must
force
itself
upon
his
notice
however
little
he
may
be
in
the
habit
of
weighing
his
own
pleasures
and
pains
he
must
always
be
able
to
deliberate
afresh
and
to
act
as
far
as
the
control
of
his
will
extends
without
reference
to
his
past
actions
it
may
however
be
said
that
though
an
egoist
retaining
his
belief
in
rational
egoism
can
not
thus
abandon
his
will
to
the
sway
of
moral
enthusiasm
still
supposing
it
possible
for
him
to
change
his
conviction
and
prefer
duty
to
interest
or
supposing
we
compare
him
with
another
man
who
makes
this
choice
we
shall
find
that
a
gain
in
happiness
on
the
whole
results
from
this
preference
it
may
be
held
that
the
pleasurable
emotions
attendant
upon
such
virtuous
or
habits
as
are
compatible
with
adhesion
to
egoistic
principles
are
so
inferior
to
the
raptures
that
attend
the
unreserved
and
passionate
surrender
of
the
soul
to
virtue
that
it
is
really
a
man
s
interest
even
with
a
view
to
the
present
life
only
to
obtain
if
he
can
the
convictions
that
render
this
surrender
possible
although
under
certain
circumstances
it
must
necessarily
lead
him
to
act
in
a
manner
which
considered
by
itself
would
be
undoubtedly
imprudent
this
is
certainly
a
tenable
proposition
and
i
am
quite
disposed
to
think
it
true
of
persons
with
specially
refined
moral
sensibilities
but
though
from
the
imperfections
of
the
hedonistic
calculus
the
proposition
can
not
in
any
case
be
conclusively
disproved
it
seems
as
i
have
said
to
be
opposed
to
the
broad
results
of
experience
so
far
as
the
great
majority
of
mankind
are
concerned
observation
would
lead
me
to
suppose
that
most
men
are
so
constituted
as
to
feel
far
more
keenly
pleasures
and
pains
arising
from
some
other
source
than
the
conscience
either
from
the
gratifications
of
sense
or
from
the
possession
of
power
and
fame
or
from
strong
human
affections
or
from
the
pursuit
of
science
art
etc
so
that
in
many
cases
perhaps
not
even
early
training
could
have
succeeded
in
giving
to
the
moral
feelings
the
requisite
predominance
and
certainly
where
this
training
has
been
wanting
it
seems
highly
improbable
that
a
mere
change
of
ethical
conviction
could
develop
their
moral
susceptibilities
so
far
as
to
make
it
clearly
their
earthly
interest
to
resolve
on
facing
all
sacrifices
for
the
fulfilment
of
duty
to
sum
up
although
the
performance
of
duties
towards
others
and
the
exercise
of
social
virtue
seem
to
be
the
best
means
to
the
attainment
of
the
individual
s
happiness
and
it
is
easy
to
exhibit
this
coincidence
between
virtue
and
happiness
rhetorically
and
popularly
still
when
we
carefully
analyse
and
estimate
the
consequences
of
virtue
to
the
virtuous
agent
it
appears
improbable
that
this
coincidence
is
complete
and
universal
we
may
conceive
the
coincidence
becoming
perfect
in
a
utopia
where
men
were
as
much
in
accord
on
moral
as
they
are
now
on
mathematical
questions
where
law
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
moral
opinion
and
all
offences
were
discovered
and
duly
punished
or
we
may
conceive
the
same
result
attained
by
intensifying
the
moral
sentiments
of
all
members
of
the
community
without
any
external
changes
which
indeed
would
then
be
unnecessary
but
just
in
proportion
as
existing
societies
and
existing
men
fall
short
of
this
ideal
rules
of
conduct
based
on
the
principles
of
egoistic
hedonism
seem
liable
to
diverge
from
those
which
most
men
are
accustomed
to
recognise
as
prescribed
by
duty
and
virtue
footnotes
such
discussion
of
the
question
as
seemed
desirable
in
a
work
like
this
will
be
found
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
treatise
for
a
similar
reason
i
shall
here
treat
the
notions
of
duty
and
virtuous
action
as
practically
coincident
reserving
for
future
discussion
the
divergences
between
the
two
which
reflection
on
the
common
usage
of
the
terms
appears
to
indicate
see
book
iii
chap
ii
whatever
modifications
of
this
division
may
afterwards
appear
to
be
necessary
cf
book
iii
chap
ii
and
chap
vii
will
not
i
think
tend
to
invalidate
the
conclusions
of
the
present
chapter
i
do
not
here
consider
the
case
of
revolutionists
aiming
sincerely
at
the
general
wellbeing
since
the
morality
of
such
revolutions
will
generally
be
so
dubious
that
these
cases
can
not
furnish
any
clear
argument
on
either
side
of
the
question
here
discussed
under
the
notion
of
moral
pain
or
pleasure
i
intend
to
include
in
this
argument
all
pain
or
pleasure
that
is
due
to
sympathy
with
the
feelings
of
others
it
is
not
convenient
to
enter
at
this
stage
of
the
discussion
into
a
full
discussion
of
the
relation
of
sympathy
to
moral
sensibility
but
i
may
say
that
it
seems
to
me
certain
on
the
one
hand
that
these
two
emotional
susceptibilities
are
actually
distinct
in
most
minds
whatever
they
may
have
been
originally
and
on
the
other
hand
that
sympathetic
and
strictly
moral
feelings
are
almost
inextricably
blended
in
the
ordinary
moral
consciousness
so
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
argument
it
is
not
of
fundamental
importance
to
draw
a
distinction
between
them
i
have
however
thought
it
desirable
to
undertake
a
further
examination
of
sympathy
as
the
internal
sanction
on
which
utilitarians
specially
lay
stress
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
this
treatise
to
which
accordingly
the
reader
may
refer
a
striking
confirmation
of
this
is
furnished
by
those
christian
writers
of
the
last
century
who
treat
the
unbeliever
as
a
fool
who
sacrifices
his
happiness
both
here
and
hereafter
these
men
were
for
the
most
part
earnestly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
virtue
and
yet
this
practice
had
not
made
them
love
virtue
so
much
as
to
prefer
it
even
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
the
sensual
and
other
enjoyments
that
it
excludes
it
seems
then
absurd
to
suppose
that
in
the
case
of
persons
who
have
not
developed
and
strengthened
by
habit
their
virtuous
impulses
the
pain
that
might
afterwards
result
from
resisting
the
call
of
duty
would
always
be
sufficient
to
neutralise
all
other
sources
of
pleasure
chapter
vi
deductive
hedonism
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
seen
reason
to
conclude
that
while
obedience
to
recognised
rules
of
duty
tends
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
promote
the
happiness
of
the
agent
there
are
yet
no
adequate
empirical
grounds
for
regarding
the
performance
of
duty
as
a
universal
or
infallible
means
to
the
attainment
of
this
end
even
however
if
it
were
otherwise
even
if
it
were
demonstrably
reasonable
for
the
egoist
to
choose
duty
at
all
costs
under
all
circumstances
the
systematic
endeavour
to
realise
this
principle
would
not
according
to
common
notions
of
morality
solve
or
supersede
the
problem
of
determining
the
right
method
for
seeking
happiness
for
the
received
moral
code
allows
within
limits
the
pursuit
of
our
own
happiness
and
even
seems
to
regard
it
as
morally
prescribed
and
still
more
emphatically
inculcates
the
promotion
of
the
happiness
of
other
individuals
with
whom
we
are
in
various
ways
specially
connected
so
that
under
either
head
the
questions
that
we
have
before
considered
as
to
the
determination
and
measurement
of
the
elements
of
happiness
would
still
require
some
kind
of
answer
it
remains
to
ask
how
far
a
scientific
investigation
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
can
assist
us
in
dealing
with
this
practical
problem
now
it
is
obvious
that
for
deciding
which
of
two
courses
of
action
is
preferable
on
hedonistic
grounds
we
require
not
only
to
measure
pains
and
pleasures
of
different
kinds
but
also
to
ascertain
how
they
may
be
produced
or
averted
in
most
important
prudential
decisions
complex
chains
of
consequences
are
foreseen
as
intervening
between
the
volition
we
are
immediately
to
initiate
and
the
feelings
which
constitute
the
ultimate
end
of
our
efforts
and
the
degree
of
accuracy
with
which
we
forecast
each
link
of
these
chains
obviously
depends
upon
our
knowledge
implicit
or
explicit
of
the
relations
of
cause
and
effect
among
various
natural
phenomena
but
if
we
suppose
the
different
elements
and
immediate
sources
of
happiness
to
have
been
duly
ascertained
and
valued
the
investigation
of
the
conditions
of
production
of
each
hardly
belongs
to
a
general
treatise
on
the
method
of
ethics
but
rather
to
some
one
or
other
of
the
special
arts
subordinate
to
the
general
art
of
conduct
of
these
subordinate
arts
some
have
a
more
or
less
scientific
basis
while
others
are
in
a
merely
empirical
stage
thus
if
we
have
decided
how
far
health
is
to
be
sought
it
belongs
to
the
systematic
art
of
hygiene
based
on
physiological
science
to
furnish
a
detailed
plan
of
seeking
it
so
far
on
the
other
hand
as
we
aim
at
power
or
wealth
or
domestic
happiness
such
instruction
as
the
experience
of
others
can
give
will
be
chiefly
obtained
in
an
unsystematic
form
either
from
advice
relative
to
our
own
special
circumstances
or
from
accounts
of
success
and
failure
in
analogous
situations
in
either
case
the
exposition
of
such
special
arts
does
not
appear
to
come
within
the
scope
of
the
present
treatise
nor
could
it
help
us
in
dealing
with
the
difficulties
of
measuring
pleasures
and
pains
which
we
have
considered
in
the
previous
chapters
it
may
however
be
thought
that
a
knowledge
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
may
carry
us
beyond
the
determination
of
the
means
of
gaining
particular
kinds
of
pleasure
and
avoiding
particular
kinds
of
pain
and
enable
us
to
substitute
some
deductive
method
of
evaluing
the
elements
of
happiness
for
the
method
of
which
we
have
seen
the
defects
a
hedonistic
method
indeed
that
would
dispense
altogether
with
direct
estimates
of
the
pleasurable
and
painful
consequences
of
actions
is
almost
as
inconceivable
as
a
method
of
astronomy
that
would
dispense
with
observations
of
the
stars
it
is
however
conceivable
that
by
induction
from
cases
in
which
empirical
measurement
is
easy
we
may
obtain
generalisations
that
will
give
us
more
trustworthy
guidance
than
such
measurement
can
do
in
complicated
cases
we
may
be
able
to
ascertain
some
general
psychical
or
physical
concomitant
or
antecedent
of
pleasure
and
pain
more
easy
to
recognise
foresee
measure
and
produce
or
avert
in
such
cases
than
pleasure
and
pain
themselves
i
am
willing
to
hope
that
this
refuge
from
the
difficulties
of
empirical
hedonism
may
some
time
or
other
be
open
to
us
but
i
can
not
perceive
that
it
is
at
present
available
there
is
at
present
so
far
as
i
can
judge
no
satisfactorily
established
general
theory
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
such
theories
as
have
gained
a
certain
degree
of
acceptance
as
partially
true
or
probable
are
manifestly
not
adapted
for
the
practical
application
that
we
here
require
the
chief
difficulty
of
finding
a
universally
applicable
theory
of
the
causes
of
pleasures
and
pains
is
easily
explained
pleasures
and
pains
may
be
assumed
to
have
universally
like
other
psychical
facts
certain
cerebral
specifically
unknown
as
their
inseparable
concomitants
accordingly
we
may
seek
their
causes
either
in
antecedent
physical
or
antecedent
psychical
facts
but
in
one
important
class
of
cases
the
chief
cognisable
antecedents
are
obviously
of
the
former
kind
while
in
another
important
class
they
are
obviously
of
the
latter
kind
the
difficulty
is
to
establish
any
theory
equally
applicable
to
both
classes
or
to
bring
the
results
of
the
two
lines
of
inquiry
under
a
single
generalisation
without
palpably
unsupported
hypotheses
in
the
case
of
pleasures
and
pains
especially
pains
connected
with
sensation
the
most
important
cognisable
antecedents
are
clearly
physical
i
do
not
deny
that
when
the
pain
is
foreseen
the
attitude
of
mind
in
which
it
is
met
may
materially
influence
its
magnitude
indeed
in
the
hypnotic
condition
of
the
brain
the
feeling
of
pain
may
be
apparently
altogether
prevented
by
an
antecedent
belief
that
it
will
not
be
felt
still
in
the
main
under
ordinary
conditions
the
pains
of
sensation
probably
the
intensest
in
the
experience
of
most
persons
invade
and
interrupt
our
psychical
life
from
without
and
it
would
be
idle
to
look
for
the
chief
causes
of
their
intensity
or
quality
among
antecedent
psychical
facts
this
is
not
equally
true
of
the
most
prominent
pleasures
of
sense
since
antecedent
desire
if
not
an
absolutely
indispensable
condition
of
such
pleasures
seems
at
any
rate
necessary
to
their
attaining
a
high
degree
of
intensity
still
the
chief
causes
of
these
desires
themselves
are
clearly
physical
states
and
processes
not
merely
neural
in
the
organism
of
the
sentient
individual
and
this
is
also
true
of
a
more
indefinite
kind
of
pleasure
which
is
an
important
element
of
ordinary
human
happiness
the
that
accompanies
and
is
a
sign
of
physical
on
the
other
hand
when
we
investigate
the
causes
of
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
belong
to
intellectual
exercises
or
the
play
of
personal
affections
or
of
the
pleasures
and
to
some
extent
pains
that
belong
to
the
contemplation
of
beauty
or
its
opposite
in
art
or
nature
no
physiological
theory
can
carry
us
far
owing
to
our
ignorance
of
the
neural
processes
that
accompany
or
antecede
these
feelings
this
is
my
general
conclusion
the
grounds
for
which
i
propose
to
illustrate
and
explain
further
in
the
present
chapter
it
would
however
seem
to
be
quite
beyond
my
limits
to
attempt
anything
like
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
either
psychological
or
physiological
theories
of
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
i
shall
confine
myself
to
certain
leading
generalisations
which
seem
to
have
a
special
interest
for
students
of
ethics
either
because
ethical
motives
have
had
a
share
in
causing
their
acceptance
or
because
though
inadequately
grounded
as
general
theories
they
appear
to
have
a
partial
and
limited
value
for
practical
guidance
let
us
begin
by
considering
a
theory
primarily
psychological
which
has
at
least
the
merit
of
antiquity
as
it
is
admittedly
derived
from
aristotle
and
is
in
some
form
or
other
still
current
it
is
that
expressed
by
sir
hamilton
in
the
following
propositions
pleasure
is
the
reflex
of
the
spontaneous
and
unimpeded
exertion
of
a
power
of
whose
energy
we
are
conscious
pain
a
reflex
of
the
overstrained
or
repressed
exertion
of
such
a
the
phrases
suggest
as
ordinarily
distinguished
from
states
but
hamilton
explains
that
energy
and
similar
terms
are
to
be
understood
to
denote
indifferently
all
the
processes
of
our
higher
and
lower
life
of
which
we
are
conscious
on
the
ground
that
consciousness
itself
implies
more
than
a
mere
passivity
of
the
subject
i
think
however
that
the
theory
is
evidently
framed
primarily
to
suit
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
belong
to
the
intellectual
life
as
such
and
is
only
applied
by
a
somewhat
violent
straining
to
an
important
class
among
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
belong
to
man
s
animal
life
for
hamilton
explains
his
terms
spontaneous
and
unimpeded
to
imply
respectively
absence
of
forcible
repression
or
forcible
stimulation
of
the
power
exercised
and
absence
of
checks
or
hindrances
on
the
part
of
the
object
about
which
it
is
conversant
but
these
terms
seem
to
have
no
clear
psychical
import
in
application
to
organic
sensations
of
the
kind
ordinarily
called
passive
the
feelings
and
vague
representations
of
bodily
processes
which
constitute
the
consciousness
of
a
toothache
are
as
free
from
conscious
repression
or
stimulation
as
those
which
constitute
the
consciousness
that
accompanies
a
warm
bath
except
so
far
as
the
mere
presence
of
pain
implies
constraint
since
we
experience
it
unwillingly
and
the
mere
presence
of
pleasure
implies
the
opposite
but
in
this
sense
constraint
and
its
opposite
are
characteristics
of
the
effects
to
be
explained
and
can
not
therefore
be
regarded
as
their
causes
indeed
the
ethical
interest
and
value
of
the
theory
appears
to
me
to
lie
in
its
very
it
tends
to
correct
a
vulgar
error
in
the
estimate
of
pleasure
by
directing
attention
strongly
to
the
importance
of
a
class
of
pleasures
which
ordinary
probably
undervalues
the
pleasures
that
specially
belong
to
a
life
filled
with
strenuous
activity
whether
purely
intellectual
or
practical
and
partly
physical
in
the
same
way
it
effectively
dispels
the
popular
inadvertence
of
regarding
labour
as
normally
painful
because
some
labour
is
so
and
because
the
pleasures
connected
with
relief
from
toil
the
pleasures
of
repose
and
play
are
in
the
experience
of
most
persons
more
striking
than
the
pleasures
of
strenuous
activity
at
the
same
time
even
if
we
limit
the
theory
to
the
pleasures
and
pains
immediately
connected
with
voluntary
activity
intellectual
or
physical
it
seems
to
me
devoid
not
only
of
definite
guidance
but
also
of
adequate
theoretical
precision
for
it
seems
to
imply
that
the
exercise
of
our
powers
is
always
made
less
pleasant
by
the
presence
of
impediments
but
this
is
obviously
not
true
either
of
mainly
intellectual
or
mainly
physical
activities
some
obstacles
undeniably
increase
pleasure
by
drawing
out
force
and
skill
to
overcome
them
as
is
clearly
shown
in
the
case
of
games
and
sports
and
even
if
we
understand
impediments
to
be
only
such
hindrances
as
repress
and
diminish
action
i
do
not
find
that
the
theory
is
supported
by
experience
except
so
far
as
the
repression
causes
the
specific
discomfort
of
unsatisfied
desire
i
find
entertainment
rather
than
discomfort
in
trying
to
make
out
objects
in
a
dim
light
or
the
meaning
of
a
speech
in
a
strange
language
provided
that
failure
does
not
interfere
with
the
attainment
of
any
end
to
which
i
attach
importance
it
is
a
fundamental
defect
in
hamilton
s
theory
even
in
its
more
limited
application
that
it
ignores
the
teleological
character
of
normal
human
activity
this
defect
is
avoided
in
a
modification
of
the
theory
that
a
recent
writer
has
adopted
the
antithesis
says
stout
between
pleasure
and
pain
is
coincident
with
the
antithesis
between
free
and
impeded
progress
towards
an
end
unimpeded
progress
is
pleasant
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
and
complexity
of
mental
excitement
an
activity
which
is
thwarted
and
retarded
is
painful
in
proportion
to
its
intensity
and
complexity
and
to
the
degree
of
the
stout
admits
the
difficulty
of
applying
this
principle
of
explanation
to
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
sense
and
unlike
hamilton
he
expressly
recognises
that
a
struggle
with
difficulties
which
is
not
too
prolonged
or
too
intense
may
enhance
the
pleasure
of
success
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
own
but
this
qualification
seems
to
render
the
propositions
first
laid
down
unimportant
from
our
present
practical
point
of
view
whatever
may
be
their
theoretical
value
i
think
too
that
the
importance
of
antecedent
desire
as
a
condition
of
the
pleasures
and
pains
attendant
on
voluntary
activities
should
be
more
expressly
recognised
when
desire
is
strong
hopeful
effort
to
overcome
difficulties
in
the
way
of
fruition
tends
to
be
proportionally
pleasurable
apart
from
actual
success
while
disappointment
or
the
fear
of
disappointment
similarly
tends
to
be
painful
but
when
desire
is
not
strong
the
shock
of
thwarted
activity
and
unfulfilled
expectation
may
be
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
thus
suppose
i
take
a
walk
for
pleasure
intending
to
reach
a
neighbouring
village
and
find
an
unexpected
flood
crossing
my
road
if
i
have
no
strong
motive
for
arriving
at
the
village
the
surprise
and
consequent
change
in
the
plan
of
my
walk
will
probably
be
on
the
whole
a
pleasurable
incident
the
importance
of
eager
desire
as
a
condition
of
pleasure
is
noteworthy
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
as
it
gives
the
psychological
basis
for
the
familiar
precept
to
repress
with
a
view
to
private
happiness
desires
for
ends
that
are
either
unattainable
or
incompatible
with
the
course
of
life
which
prudence
marks
out
and
for
the
somewhat
less
trite
maxim
of
encouraging
and
developing
desires
that
prompt
in
the
same
direction
as
rational
choice
suppose
now
we
drop
the
dubious
term
unimpeded
retaining
hamilton
s
idea
of
overstrained
or
repressed
exertion
as
the
condition
of
pain
and
at
the
same
time
passing
to
a
physical
point
of
view
mean
by
activity
the
activity
of
an
we
thus
reach
what
is
substantially
spencer
s
doctrine
that
pains
are
the
psychical
concomitants
of
excessive
or
deficient
actions
of
organs
while
pleasures
are
the
concomitants
of
medium
activities
in
considering
this
theory
it
will
be
convenient
to
take
pains
and
pleasures
separately
as
it
is
obviously
based
primarily
on
experiences
of
pain
rather
than
of
pleasure
especially
of
the
pains
of
sense
to
which
hamilton
s
theory
seemed
palpably
inapplicable
instances
are
abundant
in
which
pain
is
obviously
caused
by
excessive
stimulation
of
nerves
thus
when
we
gradually
increase
the
intensity
of
sensible
heat
pressure
muscular
effort
we
encounter
pain
at
a
certain
point
of
the
increase
deafening
sounds
are
highly
disagreeable
and
to
confront
a
tropical
sun
with
unprotected
eyeballs
would
soon
become
torture
some
pains
again
as
spencer
points
out
arise
from
the
excessive
actions
of
organs
whose
normal
actions
yield
no
feelings
as
when
the
digestive
apparatus
is
overtaxed
still
in
none
of
these
cases
does
it
seem
clear
that
pain
supervenes
through
a
mere
intensification
of
the
action
of
the
organ
in
question
and
not
rather
through
some
change
in
the
kind
of
action
some
inchoate
disintegration
or
disorganisation
and
this
latter
cause
rather
than
mere
quantity
of
stimulation
is
strongly
suggested
by
a
consideration
of
the
pains
due
to
wounds
and
diseases
and
even
of
the
transient
digestive
discomforts
which
arise
from
an
improper
kind
rather
than
an
improper
quantity
of
food
and
a
similar
explanation
seems
to
me
most
probable
in
the
case
of
pains
which
according
to
spencer
arise
from
deficient
action
he
speaks
of
these
as
discomforts
or
cravings
but
as
i
have
before
pointed
out
bodily
appetites
and
other
desires
may
be
impulses
to
action
without
being
appreciably
painful
and
in
my
experience
when
they
become
decidedly
painful
some
disturbance
tending
to
derangement
may
be
presumed
either
in
the
organ
primarily
concerned
or
in
the
organism
as
a
whole
thus
hunger
in
my
experience
may
be
extremely
keen
without
being
appreciably
painful
and
when
i
find
it
painful
experience
leads
me
to
expect
a
temporarily
reduced
power
of
assimilation
indicating
some
disorganisation
in
the
digestive
apparatus
in
any
case
empirical
evidence
supports
excessive
action
of
an
organ
as
a
cause
of
pain
far
more
clearly
than
deficient
indeed
a
consideration
of
this
evidence
has
led
some
psychologists
to
adopt
the
generalisation
that
there
is
no
quality
of
sensation
absolutely
pleasant
or
unpleasant
but
that
every
kind
of
sensation
as
it
grows
in
intensity
begins
at
a
certain
point
to
be
pleasurable
and
continues
such
up
to
a
certain
further
point
at
which
it
passes
rapidly
through
indifference
into
pain
my
own
experience
however
fails
to
support
this
generalisation
i
agree
with
gurney
that
of
many
tastes
and
odours
the
faintest
possible
suggestion
is
disagreeable
while
other
feelings
resulting
from
stimulation
of
appear
to
remain
highly
pleasurable
at
the
highest
degree
of
stimulation
which
the
actual
conditions
of
physical
life
appear
to
allow
however
this
may
be
whether
we
conceive
the
nervous
action
of
which
pain
is
an
immediate
consequent
or
concomitant
as
merely
excessive
in
quantity
or
in
some
way
discordant
or
disorganised
in
quality
it
is
obvious
that
neither
explanation
can
furnish
us
with
any
important
practical
guidance
since
we
have
no
general
means
of
ascertaining
independently
of
our
experience
of
pain
itself
what
nervous
actions
are
excessive
or
disorganised
and
the
cases
where
we
have
such
means
do
not
present
any
practical
problems
which
the
theory
enables
us
to
solve
no
one
doubts
that
wounds
and
diseases
are
to
be
avoided
under
all
ordinary
circumstances
and
in
the
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
we
may
be
moved
to
choose
them
as
the
least
of
several
evils
the
exactest
knowledge
of
their
precise
operation
in
causing
pain
is
not
likely
to
assist
our
choice
it
may
be
said
however
turning
from
pain
to
pleasure
that
the
generalisation
which
we
have
been
considering
at
any
rate
gives
us
a
psychophysical
basis
for
the
ancient
maxim
of
avoiding
excess
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
but
we
have
to
observe
that
the
practical
need
of
this
maxim
is
largely
due
to
the
qualifications
which
the
psychophysical
generalisation
requires
to
make
it
true
thus
it
is
especially
needed
in
the
important
cases
in
which
is
followed
by
pain
not
at
once
but
after
an
interval
of
varying
length
alcoholic
drinking
to
many
remains
pleasurable
at
the
time
up
to
the
point
of
excess
at
which
the
brain
can
no
longer
perform
its
functions
it
is
next
morning
that
the
pain
comes
or
perhaps
in
the
case
of
topers
not
till
after
many
years
of
habitual
excess
it
should
be
noted
also
that
it
is
not
always
the
organ
of
which
the
exercise
gives
pleasure
that
also
through
causes
the
pain
of
excess
thus
when
we
are
tempted
to
eat
too
much
the
seductive
pleasure
is
mainly
due
to
the
nerves
of
taste
which
are
not
overtaxed
the
pains
come
from
the
organs
of
digestion
whose
faint
vague
pleasures
alone
would
hardly
tempt
the
voluptuary
to
excess
in
the
case
of
dangerous
mental
excitements
the
penalty
on
excess
is
usually
still
more
indirect
on
the
whole
granting
that
pleasure
like
virtue
resides
somewhere
in
the
mean
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
proposition
gives
no
practical
directions
for
attaining
it
for
first
granting
that
both
excessive
and
deficient
activities
of
organs
cause
pain
the
question
still
remains
as
spencer
himself
says
what
determines
in
any
case
the
lower
and
the
higher
limits
within
which
action
is
pleasurable
spencer
s
answer
to
this
question
i
will
consider
presently
but
there
is
a
question
no
less
obvious
to
which
he
does
not
expressly
advert
viz
why
among
the
normal
activities
of
our
physical
organs
that
have
counterparts
in
consciousness
some
only
are
pleasurable
in
any
appreciable
degree
while
many
if
not
most
are
nearly
or
quite
indifferent
it
seems
undeniable
that
while
tastes
and
smells
are
mostly
either
agreeable
or
disagreeable
most
sensations
of
touch
and
many
of
sight
and
sound
are
not
appreciably
either
and
that
in
the
daily
routine
of
healthy
life
eating
and
drinking
are
ordinarily
pleasant
while
dressing
and
undressing
walking
and
muscular
movements
generally
are
practically
indifferent
it
does
not
seem
that
an
adequate
explanation
can
be
found
in
the
operation
of
habit
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
actions
through
frequent
uniform
repetition
tend
to
become
automatic
and
lose
their
conscious
counterparts
and
hedonic
indifference
certainly
seems
in
some
cases
to
be
a
stage
through
which
such
actions
pass
on
the
way
to
unconsciousness
thus
even
a
business
walk
in
a
strange
town
is
normally
pleasant
through
the
novelty
of
the
sights
but
a
similar
walk
in
the
town
where
one
lives
is
ordinarily
indifferent
or
nearly
so
while
if
one
s
attention
is
strongly
absorbed
by
the
business
it
may
be
performed
to
a
great
extent
unconsciously
on
the
other
hand
the
operations
of
habit
often
have
the
opposite
effect
of
making
activities
pleasant
which
were
at
first
indifferent
or
even
disagreeable
as
in
the
case
of
acquired
tastes
physical
or
intellectual
indeed
such
experiences
have
long
been
i
think
quite
legitimately
used
by
moralists
as
an
encouragement
to
irksome
duties
on
the
ground
that
their
irksomeness
will
be
transient
through
the
operation
of
habit
while
the
gain
of
their
performance
will
be
permanent
spencer
indeed
regards
such
experiences
as
so
important
that
he
ventures
to
base
on
them
the
prediction
that
pleasure
will
eventually
accompany
every
mode
of
action
demanded
by
social
this
however
seems
unduly
optimistic
in
view
not
only
of
the
tendency
of
habit
to
hedonic
indifference
but
also
of
a
third
tendency
to
render
actions
at
first
indifferent
or
even
pleasant
gradually
more
irksome
thus
our
intellect
gradually
wearies
of
monotonous
activities
and
the
may
sometimes
become
intense
so
again
the
relish
of
a
kind
of
diet
at
first
agreeable
may
turn
through
monotony
into
disgust
some
quite
different
explanation
must
therefore
be
sought
for
the
varying
degrees
in
which
pleasure
accompanies
normal
activities
can
we
find
this
in
a
suggestion
of
spencer
s
developed
by
grant
allen
that
the
pleasurableness
of
normal
organic
activities
depends
on
their
and
that
the
amount
of
pleasure
is
probably
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
natural
frequency
of
excitation
of
the
involved
this
theory
certainly
finds
some
support
in
the
fact
that
the
sensual
pleasures
generally
recognised
as
greatest
are
those
attending
the
activities
of
organs
which
are
normally
left
unexercised
for
considerable
intervals
still
there
are
many
facts
that
it
does
not
explain
the
great
differences
in
the
pleasures
obtainable
at
any
given
time
by
different
stimulations
of
the
same
sense
the
phenomenon
expressed
in
the
proverbial
phrase
l
appétit
vient
en
mangeant
and
the
fact
that
the
exercise
of
the
visual
organs
after
apparently
dreamless
sleep
does
not
give
appreciably
keener
pleasure
than
it
does
at
ordinary
times
it
would
seem
that
we
must
seek
for
some
special
cause
of
the
pleasurable
effect
of
intermittence
in
certain
cases
and
this
can
not
be
merely
the
greater
intensity
of
the
nervous
action
that
takes
place
when
and
are
stimulated
for
why
if
that
were
the
explanation
should
the
normal
consciousness
of
full
nervous
activity
gradually
attained
as
when
we
are
in
full
swing
of
energetic
unwearied
work
of
a
routine
kind
be
often
nearly
or
quite
indifferent
among
the
various
competing
hypotheses
offered
at
this
point
of
our
inquiry
no
one
of
which
i
believe
has
attained
anything
like
general
acceptance
as
covering
the
whole
ground
i
select
for
discussion
one
that
has
special
ethical
interest
according
to
this
hypothesis
the
organic
process
accompanied
by
pleasure
is
to
be
conceived
as
a
restoration
of
equilibrium
after
disturbance
so
that
the
absence
of
appreciable
pleasure
in
the
case
of
certain
normal
activities
is
explained
by
the
absence
of
antecedent
disturbance
this
view
is
obviously
applicable
to
certain
classes
of
pleasures
which
though
by
no
means
rare
are
incidental
in
a
normal
life
the
pleasure
of
relief
after
physical
pain
or
after
the
strain
of
great
anxiety
and
the
pleasure
of
repose
after
unusual
exertions
intellectual
or
muscular
but
when
we
attempt
to
apply
it
to
sensational
pleasures
generally
the
indefiniteness
of
the
notion
of
equilibrium
as
applied
to
the
processes
of
a
living
organism
becomes
manifest
for
our
physical
life
consists
of
a
series
of
changes
for
the
most
part
periodically
recurrent
with
slight
modification
after
short
intervals
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
we
should
attach
the
idea
of
disturbance
or
restoration
of
equilibrium
to
any
one
among
these
normal
processes
rather
than
any
other
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
condition
of
having
expended
energy
should
be
regarded
as
a
departure
from
equilibrium
any
more
than
the
condition
of
having
just
taken
in
nutriment
in
fact
to
render
the
hypothesis
we
are
considering
at
all
applicable
to
normal
pleasures
of
sense
we
have
to
pass
from
the
physiological
to
the
psychological
point
of
view
and
take
note
of
the
psychical
state
of
as
a
consciously
condition
of
which
the
essence
is
a
felt
impulse
to
pass
out
of
this
state
towards
the
attainment
of
the
desired
object
our
hypothesis
then
may
take
this
unrestful
consciousness
as
a
sign
of
what
from
a
physiological
point
of
view
is
disturbance
of
equilibrium
and
similarly
the
satisfaction
of
desire
may
be
taken
to
be
physiologically
a
restoration
of
equilibrium
on
this
assumption
the
theory
becomes
undeniably
applicable
to
those
gratifications
of
sensual
appetite
which
form
the
most
prominent
element
of
the
pleasures
of
sense
as
popularly
conceived
now
we
have
already
noted
that
by
a
confusion
of
thought
desire
has
often
been
regarded
as
a
species
of
pain
accordingly
the
theory
that
we
are
considering
was
originally
prompted
by
the
ethical
motive
of
depreciating
the
vulgarly
overvalued
pleasures
of
satisfied
bodily
appetite
by
laying
stress
on
their
inseparable
connexion
with
antecedent
pain
the
depreciation
however
fails
so
far
as
the
appetite
which
is
a
necessary
antecedent
condition
of
the
pleasure
is
though
an
unrestful
state
not
appreciably
painful
in
any
case
admitting
the
physical
counterpart
of
conscious
desire
to
be
a
disturbance
of
equilibrium
or
an
effect
and
sign
of
such
disturbance
the
theory
seems
open
to
obvious
objections
if
it
is
extended
to
cover
the
whole
range
of
the
pleasures
of
sense
for
conscious
desire
is
certainly
not
a
necessary
condition
of
experiencing
the
simple
pleasures
of
the
special
senses
normally
no
sense
of
want
has
preceded
the
experience
of
pleasant
sights
sounds
odours
flavours
or
of
the
more
important
pleasures
more
complex
in
their
psychical
conditions
which
we
call
æsthetic
no
doubt
in
special
cases
antecedent
privation
may
produce
a
conscious
want
of
these
latter
pleasures
which
may
increase
their
intensity
when
they
are
at
length
attained
or
even
without
any
felt
privation
the
prospect
of
enjoying
such
pleasures
may
produce
a
keen
desire
for
the
enjoyment
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
disturbance
of
equilibrium
no
less
plausibly
than
a
bodily
appetite
but
it
would
be
quite
unwarrantable
therefore
to
suppose
a
similar
disturbance
though
unfelt
in
the
ordinary
cases
where
pleasures
of
this
kind
are
experienced
without
any
antecedent
consciousness
of
desire
or
want
i
have
perhaps
said
enough
to
support
my
general
conclusion
that
psychophysical
speculation
as
to
the
causes
of
pleasure
and
pain
does
not
at
present
afford
a
basis
for
a
deductive
method
of
practical
hedonism
but
before
passing
from
this
topic
i
may
remark
that
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
any
such
theory
seem
especially
great
in
the
case
of
the
complex
pleasures
which
we
distinguish
as
all
would
agree
that
æsthetic
gratification
when
at
all
high
depends
on
a
subtle
harmony
of
different
elements
in
a
complex
state
of
consciousness
and
that
the
pleasure
resulting
from
such
harmonious
combination
is
indefinitely
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
simpler
pleasures
which
the
uncombined
elements
would
yield
but
even
those
who
estimate
most
highly
the
success
that
has
so
far
been
attained
in
discovering
the
conditions
of
this
harmony
in
the
case
of
any
particular
art
would
admit
that
mere
conformity
to
the
conditions
thus
ascertained
can
not
secure
the
production
of
æsthetic
pleasure
in
any
considerable
degree
however
subtly
we
state
in
general
terms
the
objective
relations
of
elements
in
a
delightful
work
of
art
on
which
its
delight
seems
to
depend
we
must
always
feel
that
it
would
be
possible
to
produce
out
of
similar
elements
a
work
corresponding
to
our
general
description
which
would
give
no
delight
at
all
the
touch
that
gives
delight
depends
upon
an
instinct
for
which
no
deductive
reasoning
can
supply
a
substitute
this
is
true
even
without
taking
into
account
the
wide
divergences
that
we
actually
find
in
the
æsthetic
sensibilities
of
individuals
still
less
therefore
is
it
needful
to
argue
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
individual
seeking
his
own
greatest
happiness
none
but
a
mainly
inductive
and
empirical
method
of
estimating
æsthetic
pleasures
can
be
made
available
i
now
pass
to
consider
a
theory
which
may
be
distinguished
from
those
discussed
in
the
preceding
section
as
being
biological
rather
than
psychophysical
since
it
directs
attention
not
to
the
actual
present
characteristics
of
the
organic
states
or
changes
of
which
pleasures
and
pains
are
the
concomitants
or
immediate
consequents
but
to
their
relations
to
the
life
of
the
organism
as
a
whole
i
mean
the
theory
that
pains
are
the
correlatives
of
actions
injurious
to
the
organism
while
pleasures
are
the
correlatives
of
acts
conducive
to
its
spencer
from
whom
the
above
propositions
are
quoted
subsequently
explains
injurious
and
conducive
to
welfare
to
mean
respectively
tending
to
decrease
or
loss
of
life
and
tending
to
continuance
or
increase
of
life
but
in
his
deduction
by
which
the
above
conclusion
is
summarily
established
injurious
and
beneficial
are
used
as
equivalent
simply
to
destructive
and
preservative
of
organic
life
and
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
take
the
terms
first
in
this
simpler
signification
spencer
s
argument
is
as
follows
if
we
substitute
for
the
word
pleasure
the
equivalent
phrase
a
feeling
which
we
seek
to
bring
into
consciousness
and
retain
there
and
if
we
substitute
for
the
word
pain
the
equivalent
phrase
a
feeling
which
we
seek
to
get
out
of
consciousness
and
to
keep
out
we
see
at
once
that
if
the
states
of
consciousness
which
a
creature
endeavours
to
maintain
are
the
correlatives
of
injurious
actions
and
if
the
states
of
consciousness
which
it
endeavours
to
expel
are
the
correlatives
of
beneficial
actions
it
must
quickly
disappear
through
persistence
in
the
injurious
and
avoidance
of
the
beneficial
in
other
words
those
races
of
beings
only
can
have
survived
in
which
on
the
average
agreeable
or
desired
feelings
went
along
with
activities
conducive
to
the
maintenance
of
life
while
disagreeable
and
feelings
went
along
with
activities
directly
or
indirectly
destructive
of
life
and
there
must
ever
have
been
other
things
equal
the
most
numerous
and
survivals
among
races
in
which
these
adjustments
of
feelings
to
actions
were
the
best
tending
ever
to
bring
about
perfect
now
i
am
not
concerned
to
deny
the
value
of
this
summary
deduction
for
certain
purposes
but
it
can
easily
be
shown
to
be
inadequate
to
afford
a
basis
for
a
deductive
method
of
seeking
maximum
happiness
for
the
individual
by
substituting
preservation
for
pleasure
as
the
end
directly
aimed
at
in
the
first
place
spencer
only
affirms
the
conclusion
to
be
true
as
he
rather
vaguely
says
on
the
average
and
it
is
obvious
that
though
the
tendency
to
find
injurious
acts
pleasant
or
preservative
acts
painful
must
be
a
disadvantage
to
any
species
of
animal
in
the
struggle
for
existence
it
may
if
existing
only
to
a
limited
extent
be
outweighed
by
other
advantages
so
that
the
organism
in
which
it
exists
may
survive
in
spite
of
it
this
i
say
is
obvious
and
common
experience
as
spencer
admits
shows
in
many
conspicuous
ways
that
this
has
been
actually
the
case
with
civilised
man
during
the
whole
period
of
history
that
we
know
owing
to
the
changes
caused
by
the
course
of
civilisation
there
has
arisen
and
must
long
continue
a
deep
and
involved
derangement
of
the
natural
connexions
between
pleasures
and
beneficial
actions
and
between
pains
and
detrimental
this
seems
to
be
in
itself
a
sufficient
objection
to
founding
a
deductive
method
of
hedonism
on
spencer
s
general
conclusion
it
is
indeed
notorious
that
civilised
men
take
pleasure
in
various
forms
of
unhealthy
conduct
and
find
conformity
to
the
rules
of
health
irksome
and
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
they
may
be
and
actually
are
susceptible
of
keen
pleasure
from
acts
and
processes
that
have
no
material
tendency
to
preserve
life
nor
is
there
any
difficulty
in
explaining
this
on
the
evolution
hypothesis
since
we
can
not
argue
from
this
hypothesis
that
the
development
of
the
nervous
system
in
human
beings
may
not
bring
with
it
intense
susceptibilities
to
pleasure
from
processes
if
only
the
preservation
of
the
individuals
in
whom
such
susceptibilities
are
developed
is
otherwise
adequately
provided
for
now
this
latter
supposition
is
obviously
realised
in
the
case
of
persons
of
leisure
in
civilised
society
whose
needs
of
food
clothing
shelter
are
abundantly
supplied
through
the
complex
social
habit
which
we
call
the
institution
of
private
property
and
i
know
no
empirical
ground
for
supposing
that
a
cultivated
man
tends
in
consequence
of
the
keen
and
varied
pleasure
which
he
seeks
and
enjoys
to
live
longer
than
a
man
who
goes
through
a
comparatively
dull
round
of
monotonous
routine
activity
interspersed
by
slightly
pleasurable
intervals
of
repose
and
play
if
however
the
individual
is
not
likely
to
obtain
a
maximum
of
pleasure
by
aiming
merely
at
preservation
it
remains
to
consider
whether
quantity
of
life
will
serve
any
better
now
it
is
of
course
true
that
so
far
as
nervous
action
is
attended
by
consciousness
pleasurable
in
quality
the
more
there
is
of
it
the
happier
we
shall
be
but
even
if
we
assume
that
the
more
intense
and
full
life
is
on
the
average
the
happier
it
by
no
means
follows
that
we
shall
gain
pleasure
by
aiming
merely
at
intensity
of
consciousness
for
we
experience
intense
pains
even
more
indubitably
than
intense
pleasures
and
in
those
full
tides
of
soul
in
which
we
seem
to
be
most
alive
painful
consciousness
may
be
mixed
in
almost
any
proportion
and
further
we
often
experience
excitement
nearly
or
quite
neutral
in
quality
not
distinctly
pleasurable
or
painful
which
reaches
a
great
pitch
of
intensity
as
in
the
case
of
laborious
struggles
with
difficulties
and
perplexing
conflicts
of
which
the
issue
is
doubtful
it
may
however
be
replied
that
quantity
of
life
must
be
taken
to
imply
not
merely
intensity
of
consciousness
but
multiplicity
and
variety
a
harmonious
and
development
of
human
nature
and
experience
certainly
seems
to
support
the
view
that
men
lose
happiness
by
allowing
some
of
their
faculties
or
capacities
to
be
withered
and
dwarfed
for
want
of
exercise
and
thus
not
leaving
themselves
sufficient
variety
of
feelings
or
activities
especially
as
regards
the
bodily
organs
it
will
be
agreed
that
the
due
exercise
of
most
if
not
all
is
indispensable
to
the
health
of
the
organism
and
further
that
the
health
maintained
by
this
balance
of
functions
is
a
more
important
source
of
the
individual
s
happiness
than
the
unhealthy
of
any
one
organ
can
be
still
it
would
appear
that
the
harmony
of
functions
necessary
to
health
is
a
very
elastic
one
and
admits
of
a
very
wide
margin
of
variation
as
far
as
the
organs
under
voluntary
control
are
concerned
a
man
who
exercises
his
brain
alone
will
probably
be
ill
in
consequence
but
he
may
exercise
his
brain
much
and
his
legs
little
or
without
any
morbid
results
and
in
the
same
way
we
can
not
lay
down
the
proposition
that
a
varied
and
life
is
the
happiest
with
as
much
precision
as
would
be
necessary
if
it
were
to
be
accepted
as
a
basis
for
deductive
hedonism
for
it
seems
to
be
also
largely
true
on
the
other
side
that
the
more
we
come
to
exercise
any
faculty
with
sustained
and
prolonged
concentration
the
more
pleasure
we
derive
from
such
exercise
up
to
the
point
at
which
it
becomes
wearisome
or
turns
into
a
routine
which
renders
consciousness
dull
and
languid
it
is
no
doubt
important
for
our
happiness
that
we
should
keep
within
this
limit
but
we
can
not
fix
it
precisely
in
any
particular
case
without
special
experience
especially
as
there
seems
always
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
weariness
and
tedium
which
must
be
resisted
and
overcome
if
we
would
bring
our
faculties
into
full
play
and
obtain
the
full
enjoyment
of
our
labour
and
similarly
in
respect
of
passive
emotional
consciousness
if
too
much
sameness
of
feeling
results
in
languor
too
much
variety
inevitably
involves
shallowness
the
point
where
concentration
ought
to
stop
and
where
dissipation
begins
varies
from
man
to
man
and
must
it
would
seem
be
decided
by
the
specific
experience
of
individuals
there
is
however
another
and
simpler
way
in
which
the
maxim
of
giving
free
development
to
one
s
nature
may
be
understood
in
the
sense
of
yielding
to
spontaneous
impulses
instead
of
endeavouring
to
govern
these
by
elaborate
forecasts
of
consequences
a
scientific
justification
for
this
course
being
found
in
the
theory
that
spontaneous
or
instinctive
impulses
really
represent
the
effects
of
previous
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
on
the
organism
in
which
they
appear
or
its
ancestors
on
this
ground
it
has
been
maintained
that
in
complicated
problems
of
conduct
experience
will
enable
the
constitution
to
estimate
the
respective
amounts
of
pleasure
and
pain
consequent
upon
each
alternative
where
it
is
impossible
for
the
intellect
to
do
this
and
will
further
cause
the
organism
instinctively
to
shun
that
course
which
produces
on
the
whole
most
that
there
is
an
important
element
of
truth
in
this
contention
i
would
not
deny
but
any
broad
conclusion
that
inclination
is
a
better
guide
than
reason
to
the
individual
s
happiness
would
be
quite
unwarranted
by
anything
that
we
know
or
can
plausibly
conjecture
respecting
biological
evolution
for
overlooking
the
effect
of
natural
selection
to
foster
impulses
tending
to
the
preservation
of
the
race
rather
than
the
pleasure
of
the
individual
and
granting
that
every
sentient
organism
tends
to
adapt
itself
to
its
environment
in
such
a
manner
as
to
acquire
instincts
of
some
value
in
guiding
it
to
pleasure
and
away
from
pain
it
by
no
means
follows
that
in
the
human
organism
one
particular
kind
of
adaptation
that
which
proceeds
by
unconscious
modification
of
instinct
is
to
be
preferred
to
that
other
kind
of
adaptation
which
is
brought
about
by
conscious
comparison
and
inference
it
rather
seems
clear
that
this
proposition
can
only
be
justified
by
a
comparison
of
the
consequences
of
yielding
to
instinctive
impulses
with
the
consequences
of
controlling
them
by
calculations
of
resulting
pleasure
and
pain
but
it
will
hardly
be
maintained
that
in
the
majority
of
clear
instances
where
impulse
conflicts
with
rational
forecast
a
subsequent
calculation
of
consequences
appears
to
justify
the
former
the
assertion
would
be
in
too
flagrant
conflict
with
the
common
sense
and
common
experience
of
mankind
hence
however
true
it
may
be
that
in
certain
cases
instinct
is
on
the
whole
a
safer
guide
than
prudential
calculation
it
would
still
seem
that
we
can
only
ascertain
these
cases
by
careful
reflection
on
experience
we
can
not
determine
the
limits
to
which
prudential
calculation
may
prudently
be
carried
except
by
this
very
calculation
itself
we
seem
then
forced
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
scientific
to
the
ascertainment
of
the
right
means
to
the
individual
s
happiness
every
attempt
to
find
a
high
priori
road
to
this
goal
brings
us
back
inevitably
to
the
empirical
method
for
instead
of
a
clear
principle
universally
valid
we
only
get
at
best
a
vague
and
general
rule
based
on
considerations
which
it
is
important
not
to
overlook
but
the
relative
value
of
which
we
can
only
estimate
by
careful
observation
and
comparison
of
individual
experience
whatever
uncertainty
besets
these
processes
must
necessarily
extend
to
all
our

happiness

have
no

exaggerate

that
we
must
all
continue
to
seek
happiness
for
ourselves
and
for
others
in
whatever
obscurity
we
may
have
to
grope
after
it

there
is
nothing
gained
by
underrating
them

it
is
idle
to
argue
as
if
they
did
not
exist

it
should
seem
that
a
due
concern
about
our

interest
or
happiness
and
a
reasonable
endeavour
to
secure
and
promote
it
is
virtue

contrary

in

the
nature
of
appended
to

this

is
suggested
by

s
statement
in
a
letter
to
mill
published
in
bain
s
and
moral
and
partially
reprinted
in

s
of
chap
iv
that
it
is
the
business
of
moral
science
to
deduce
from
the
laws
of
life
and
the
conditions
of
existence
what
kinds
of
actions
necessarily
tend
to
produce
happiness
and
what
kinds
to
produce
unhappiness
and
that
when
it
has
done
this
its
deductions
are
to
be
recognised
as
laws
of
conduct
and
are
to
be
conformed
to
irrespective
of
a
direct
estimate
of
happiness
or
i
ought
however
to
say
that
spencer
has
made
it
clear
in
his
latest
treatise
that
the
only
cogent
deductions
of
this
kind
which
he
conceives
to
be
possible
relate
to
the
behaviour
not
of
men
here
and
now
but
of
ideal
men
living
in
an
ideal
society
and
living
under
conditions
so
unlike
those
of
actual
humanity
that
all
their
actions
produce
pleasure
unalloyed
with
pain
anywhere
of
the
laws
of
conduct
in
this
utopia
constitute
in
spencer
s
view
the
of
absolute
ethics
which
he
distinguishes
from
the
relative
ethics
that
concerns
itself
with
the
conduct
of
the
imperfect
men
who
live
under
the
present
imperfect
social
conditions
and
of
which
the
method
is
as
he
admits
to
a
great
extent
necessarily
empirical
of
how
far
such
a
system
as
spencer
calls
absolute
ethics
can
be
rationally
constructed
and
how
far
its
construction
would
be
practically
useful

how

is
capable
of
furnishing

happiness
here

aristotle
s
theory
is
briefly
that
every

or
rational
activity
has
its
correspondent
pleasure
and
that
the
most
perfect
is
the
most
pleasant
the
most
perfect

of
any
faculty
being
the
exercise
of
the
faculty
in

condition
on
the
best
object
the
pleasure
follows
the
activity
immediately
giving
it
a
kind
of
finish
like
the
bloom
of
pleasures
vary
in
kind

the
activities
that
constitute

of
exhibiting

as
preferable
to
that
of
the

of

it
affords

it
may
be
added
that
in

case
of

and

the
notion
of

between
the
cerebral
antecedent
respectively
to
the
one
and
the
other
seems
altogether
unwarrantable
the
pains
of

do
not
appear

be

the

to
examine
closely
but
quite
neutrally
the
system
of
egoistic
hedonism
with
which
we
have
been
engaged
in
the
last

may
not
improbably
have
produced
on
the
reader
s
mind
a
certain
aversion
to
the
principle

examined
even
though
like
myself
he
may
find
it
difficult
not
to
admit
the
authority
of

the
rationality
of
seeking
one
s
own
individual

in
considering
enlightened
as
supplying
a
tenable
principle
for
the
systematisation
of

i
have
given
no
expression
to
this
sentiment
of
aversion
being
anxious
to
ascertain
with
scientific
impartiality
the
results
to
which
this
principle
logically
leads
when
however
we
seem
to
find
on
careful
examination
of
egoism
as
worked
out
on
a
strictly
empirical
basis
that
the
common
precepts
of
duty
which
we
are
trained
to
regard
as
sacred
must
be
to
the
egoist
rules
to
which
it
is
only
generally
speaking
and
for
the
most
part
reasonable
to
conform
but
which
under
special
circumstances
must
be
decisively
ignored
and
broken
the
offence
which
egoism
in
the
abstract
gives
to
our
sympathetic
and
social
nature
adds
force
to
the
recoil
from
it
caused
by
the
perception
of
its
occasional
practical
conflict
with
common
notions
of
duty
but
further
we
are
accustomed
to
expect
from
morality
clear
and
decisive
precepts
or
counsels
and
such
rules
as
can
be
laid
down
for
seeking
the
individual
s
greatest
happiness
can
not
but
appear
wanting
in
these
qualities
a
dubious
guidance
to
an
ignoble
end
appears
to
be
all
that
the
calculus
of
egoistic
hedonism
has
to
offer
and
it
is
by
appealing
to
the
superior
certainty
with
which
the
dictates
of
conscience
or
the
moral
faculty
are
issued
that
butler
maintains
the
practical
supremacy
of
conscience
over
in
spite
of
his
admission
in
the
passage
before
quoted
of
theoretical
priority
in
the
claims
of
the
latter
a
man
knows
certainly
he
says
what
he
ought
to
do
but
he
does
not
certainly
know
what
will
lead
to
his
happiness
in
saying
this
butler
appears
to
me
fairly
to
represent
the
common
moral
sense
of
ordinary
mankind
in
our
own
age
no
less
than
in
his
the
moral
judgments
that
men
habitually
pass
on
one
another
in
ordinary
discourse
imply
for
the
most
part
that
duty
is
usually
not
a
difficult
thing
for
an
ordinary
man
to
though
various
seductive
impulses
may
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
it
and
in
such
maxims
as
that
duty
should
be
performed
advienne
que
pourra
that
truth
should
be
spoken
without
regard
to
consequences
that
justice
should
be
done
though
the
sky
should
fall
it
is
implied
that
we
have
the
power
of
seeing
clearly
that
certain
kinds
of
actions
are
right
and
reasonable
in
themselves
apart
from
their
consequences
or
rather
with
a
merely
partial
consideration
of
consequences
from
which
other
consequences
admitted
to
be
possibly
good
or
bad
are
definitely
excluded
and
such
a
power
is
claimed
for
the
human
mind
by
most
of
the
writers
who
have
maintained
the
existence
of
moral
intuitions
i
have
therefore
thought
myself
justified
in
treating
this
claim
as
characteristic
of
the
method
which
i
distinguish
as
intuitional
at
the
same
time
as
i
have
before
observed
there
is
a
wider
sense
in
which
the
term
intuitional
might
be
legitimately
applied
to
either
egoistic
or
universalistic
hedonism
so
far
as
either
system
lays
down
as
a
first
principle
which
if
known
at
all
must
be
intuitively
known
that
happiness
is
the
only
rational
ultimate
end
of
action
to
this
meaning
i
shall
recur
in
the
concluding
chapters
xiii
and
xiv
of
this
book
in
which
i
shall
discuss
more
fully
the
intuitive
character
of
these
hedonistic
principles
but
since
the
adoption
of
this
wider
meaning
would
not
lead
us
to
a
distinct
ethical
method
i
have
thought
it
best
in
the
detailed
discussion
of
intuitionism
which
occupies
the
first
eleven
chapters
of
this
book
to
confine
myself
as
far
as
possible
to
moral
intuition
understood
in
the
narrower
sense
above
defined
here
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
in
thus
defining
intuitionism
i
have
omitted
its
most
fundamental
characteristic
that
the
intuitionist
properly
speaking
in
contrast
with
the
utilitarian
does
not
judge
actions
by
an
external
standard
at
all
that
true
morality
in
his
view
is
not
concerned
with
outward
actions
as
such
but
with
the
state
of
mind
in
which
acts
are
done
in
short
with
intentions
and
i
think
however
that
this
objection
is
partly
due
to
a
misunderstanding
moralists
of
all
schools
i
conceive
would
agree
that
the
moral
judgments
which
we
pass
on
actions
relate
primarily
to
intentional
actions
regarded
as
intentional
in
other
words
what
we
judge
to
be
wrong
in
the
strictest
ethical
sense
is
not
any
part
of
the
actual
effects
as
such
of
the
muscular
movements
immediately
caused
by
the
agent
s
volition
but
the
effects
which
he
foresaw
in
willing
the
act
or
more
strictly
his
volition
or
choice
of
realising
the
effects
as
foreseen
when
i
speak
therefore
of
acts
i
must
be
understood
to
mean
unless
the
contrary
is
stated
acts
presumed
to
be
intentional
and
judged
as
such
on
this
point
i
do
not
think
that
any
dispute
need
arise
the
case
of
motives
is
different
and
requires
careful
discussion
in
the
first
place
the
distinction
between
motive
and
intention
in
ordinary
language
is
not
very
precise
since
we
apply
the
term
motive
to
foreseen
consequences
of
an
act
so
far
as
they
are
conceived
to
be
objects
of
desire
to
the
agent
or
to
the
desire
of
such
consequences
and
when
we
speak
of
the
intention
of
an
act
we
usually
no
doubt
have
desired
consequences
in
view
i
think
however
that
for
purposes
of
exact
moral
or
jural
discussion
it
is
best
to
include
under
the
term
intention
all
the
consequences
of
an
act
that
are
foreseen
as
certain
or
probable
since
it
will
be
admitted
that
we
can
not
evade
responsibility
for
any
foreseen
bad
consequences
of
our
acts
by
the
plea
that
we
felt
no
desire
for
them
either
for
their
own
sake
or
as
means
to
ulterior
ends
such
undesired
accompaniments
of
the
desired
results
of
our
volitions
are
clearly
chosen
or
willed
by
us
hence
the
intention
of
an
act
may
be
judged
to
be
wrong
while
the
motive
is
recognised
as
good
as
when
a
man
commits
perjury
to
save
a
parent
s
or
a
benefactor
s
life
such
judgments
are
in
fact
continually
passed
in
common
moral
discourse
it
may
however
be
said
that
an
act
can
not
be
right
even
when
the
intention
is
such
as
duty
would
prescribe
if
it
be
done
from
a
bad
motive
that
to
take
a
case
suggested
by
bentham
a
man
who
prosecutes
from
malice
a
person
whom
he
believes
to
be
guilty
does
not
really
act
rightly
for
though
it
may
be
his
duty
to
prosecute
he
ought
not
to
do
it
from
malice
it
is
doubtless
true
that
it
is
our
duty
to
get
rid
of
bad
motives
if
we
can
so
that
a
man
s
intention
can
not
be
right
unless
it
includes
the
repression
so
far
as
possible
of
a
motive
known
to
be
bad
but
no
one
i
think
will
contend
that
we
can
always
suppress
entirely
a
strong
emotion
and
such
suppression
will
be
especially
difficult
if
we
are
to
do
the
act
to
which
the
wrong
impulse
prompts
while
yet
if
that
act
be
clearly
a
duty
which
no
one
else
can
so
properly
perform
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
we
ought
to
omit
it
because
we
can
not
altogether
exclude
an
objectionable
motive
it
is
sometimes
said
that
though
we
may
not
be
able
in
doing
our
duty
to
exclude
a
bad
motive
altogether
from
our
minds
it
is
still
possible
to
refuse
to
act
from
it
but
i
think
that
this
is
only
possible
so
far
as
the
details
of
action
to
which
a
right
motive
would
prompt
differ
to
some
extent
from
those
to
which
a
wrong
motive
would
prompt
no
doubt
this
is
often
the
case
thus
in
bentham
s
example
a
malevolent
prosecutor
may
be
prompted
to
take
unfair
advantage
of
his
enemy
or
cause
him
needless
pain
by
studied
insults
and
it
is
obviously
possible
for
him
and
his
duty
to
resist
such
promptings
but
so
far
as
precisely
the
same
action
is
prompted
by
two
different
motives
both
present
in
my
consciousness
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
power
to
cause
this
action
to
be
determined
by
one
of
the
two
motives
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
in
other
words
while
a
man
can
resolve
to
aim
at
any
end
which
he
conceives
as
a
possible
result
of
his
voluntary
action
he
can
not
simultaneously
resolve
to
aim
at
any
other
end
which
he
believes
will
be
promoted
by
the
same
action
and
if
that
other
end
be
an
object
of
desire
to
him
he
can
not
while
aiming
at
it
refuse
to
act
from
this
desire
on
the
whole
then
i
conclude
that
while
many
actions
are
commonly
judged
to
be
made
or
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
certain
motives
our
judgments
of
and
strictly
speaking
relate
to
intentions
as
distinguished
from
motives
and
that
while
intentions
affecting
the
agent
s
own
feelings
and
character
are
morally
prescribed
no
less
than
intentions
to
produce
certain
external
effects
still
the
latter
form
the
primary
though
not
the
sole
content
of
the
main
prescriptions
of
duty
as
commonly
affirmed
and
understood
but
the
extent
to
which
this
is
the
case
will
become
more
clear
as
we
proceed
it
has
indeed
been
maintained
by
moralists
of
influence
that
the
moral
value
of
our
conduct
depends
upon
the
degree
to
which
we
are
actuated
by
the
one
motive
which
they
regard
as
truly
moral
viz
the
desire
or
free
choice
of
doing
what
is
right
as
such
realising
duty
or
virtue
for
duty
or
virtue
s
sake
and
that
a
perfectly
good
act
must
be
done
entirely
from
this
motive
i
think
however
that
it
is
difficult
to
combine
this
view
which
i
may
conveniently
distinguish
as
stoical
with
the
belief
which
modern
orthodox
moralists
have
usually
been
concerned
to
maintain
that
it
is
always
a
man
s
true
interest
to
act
virtuously
i
do
not
mean
that
a
man
who
holds
this
belief
must
necessarily
be
an
egoist
but
it
seems
to
me
impossible
for
him
to
exclude
from
his
motives
a
regard
for
his
own
interest
while
yet
believing
that
it
will
be
promoted
by
the
act
which
he
is
willing
if
therefore
we
hold
that
this
impairs
the
moral
value
of
an
act
otherwise
virtuous
and
at
the
same
time
hold
that
virtue
is
always
conducive
to
the
virtuous
agent
s
interest
we
seem
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
knowledge
of
the
true
relation
between
virtue
and
happiness
is
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
the
attainment
of
moral
perfection
i
can
not
accept
this
paradox
and
in
subsequent
chapters
i
shall
try
to
show
that
the
stoical
view
of
moral
goodness
is
not
on
the
whole
sustained
by
a
comprehensive
survey
and
comparison
of
common
moral
judgments
since
in
some
cases
acts
appear
to
have
the
quality
of
virtue
even
more
strikingly
when
performed
from
some
motive
other
than
the
love
of
virtue
as
such
for
the
present
i
wish
rather
to
point
out
that
the
doctrine
above
stated
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
view
that
the
universal
or
normal
motives
of
human
action
are
either
particular
desires
of
pleasure
or
aversions
to
pain
for
the
agent
himself
or
the
more
general
regard
to
his
happiness
on
the
whole
which
i
term
that
it
also
excludes
the
less
extreme
doctrine
that
duties
may
be
to
some
extent
properly
done
from
such
motives
and
that
one
or
other
of
these
positions
has
frequently
been
held
by
writers
who
have
expressly
adopted
an
intuitional
method
of
ethics
for
instance
we
find
locke
laying
down
without
reserve
or
qualification
that
good
and
evil
are
nothing
but
pleasure
and
pain
or
that
which
occasions
or
procures
pleasure
or
pain
to
us
so
that
it
would
be
utterly
in
vain
to
suppose
a
rule
set
to
the
free
actions
of
man
without
annexing
it
to
some
reward
or
punishment
to
determine
his
on
the
other
hand
he
expresses
with
no
less
emphasis
the
conviction
that
from
propositions
by
necessary
consequences
as
incontestable
as
those
in
mathematics
the
measures
of
right
and
wrong
might
be
made
out
so
that
morality
might
be
placed
among
the
sciences
capable
of
the
combination
of
these
two
doctrines
gives
us
the
view
that
moral
rules
are
essentially
laws
of
god
which
men
are
impelled
to
obey
solely
or
mainly
from
fear
or
hope
of
divine
punishments
or
rewards
and
some
such
view
as
this
seems
to
be
widely
accepted
by
plain
men
without
very
refined
moral
sensibilities
as
an
example
again
of
thinkers
who
while
recognising
in
human
nature
a
disinterested
regard
for
duty
or
virtue
as
such
still
consider
that
is
a
proper
and
legitimate
motive
to
right
conduct
we
may
refer
to
butler
and
his
disciples
butler
regards
reasonable
as
not
merely
a
normal
motive
to
human
action
but
as
being
no
less
than
conscience
a
chief
or
superior
principle
in
the
nature
of
man
so
that
an
action
becomes
unsuitable
to
this
nature
if
the
principle
of
be
violated
accordingly
the
aim
of
his
teaching
is
not
to
induce
men
to
choose
duty
rather
than
interest
but
to
convince
them
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
two
that
and
conscience
lead
to
one
and
the
same
course
of
this
intermediate
doctrine
appears
to
me
to
be
more
in
harmony
with
the
common
sense
of
mankind
on
the
whole
than
either
of
the
extreme
views
before
contrasted
but
i
do
not
conceive
that
any
one
of
the
three
positions
is
inconsistent
with
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
intuitional
method
even
those
who
hold
that
human
beings
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
conform
to
moral
rules
disinterestedly
or
from
any
other
motive
than
that
supplied
by
the
sanctions
divinely
attached
to
them
still
commonly
conceive
god
as
supreme
reason
whose
laws
must
be
essentially
reasonable
and
so
far
as
such
laws
are
held
to
be
cognisable
by
the
light
of
nature
so
that
morality
as
locke
says
may
be
placed
among
demonstrative
sciences
the
method
of
determining
them
will
be
none
the
less
intuitional
because
it
is
combined
with
the
belief
that
god
will
reward
their
observance
and
punish
their
violation
on
the
other
hand
those
who
hold
that
regard
for
duty
as
duty
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
acting
rightly
would
generally
admit
that
acting
rightly
is
not
adequately
defined
as
acting
from
a
pure
desire
to
act
rightly
that
though
in
a
certain
sense
a
man
who
sincerely
desires
and
intends
to
act
rightly
does
all
he
can
and
completely
fulfils
duty
still
such
a
man
may
have
a
wrong
judgment
as
to
the
particulars
of
his
duty
and
therefore
in
another
sense
may
act
wrongly
if
this
be
admitted
it
is
evident
that
even
on
the
view
that
the
desire
or
resolution
to
fulfil
duty
as
such
is
essential
to
right
action
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
rightness
is
required
which
we
may
express
by
saying
that
an
act
is
on
this
view
formally
right
if
the
agent
in
willing
is
moved
by
pure
desire
to
fulfil
duty
or
chooses
duty
for
duty
s
sake
materially
right
if
he
intends
the
right
particular
effects
this
distinction
being
taken
it
becomes
plain
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
principles
and
method
for
determining
material
rightness
or
rightness
of
particular
effects
should
not
be
adopted
by
thinkers
who
differ
most
widely
on
the
question
of
formal
rightness
and
it
is
obviously
with
material
rightness
that
the
work
of
the
systematic
moralist
is
mainly
concerned
the
term
formal
rightness
as
above
used
implying
a
or
choice
of
the
act
as
right
implies
also
a
that
it
is
so
but
the
latter
condition
may
exist
without
the
former
i
can
not
perform
an
act
from
pure
love
of
duty
without
believing
it
to
be
right
but
i
can
believe
it
to
be
right
and
yet
do
it
from
some
other
motive
and
there
seems
to
be
more
agreement
among
moralists
who
adopt
the
intuitional
method
as
to
the
moral
indispensability
of
such
a
belief
than
we
have
found
with
respect
to
the
question
of
motive
at
least
it
would
i
conceive
be
universally
held
that
no
act
can
be
absolutely
right
whatever
its
external
aspect
and
relations
which
is
believed
by
the
agent
to
be
wrong
such
an
act
we
may
call
subjectively
wrong
even
though
objectively
right
it
may
still
be
asked
whether
it
is
better
in
any
particular
case
that
a
man
should
do
what
he
mistakenly
believes
to
be
his
duty
or
what
really
is
his
duty
in
the
particular
circumstances
considered
apart
from
his
mistaken
belief
and
would
be
completely
right
if
he
could
only
think
so
the
question
is
rather
subtle
and
perplexing
to
common
sense
it
is
therefore
worth
while
to
point
out
that
it
can
have
only
a
limited
and
subordinate
practical
application
for
no
one
in
considering
what
he
ought
himself
to
do
in
any
particular
case
can
distinguish
what
he
believes
to
be
right
from
what
really
is
so
the
necessity
for
a
practical
choice
between
subjective
and
objective
rightness
can
only
present
itself
in
respect
of
the
conduct
of
another
person
whom
it
is
in
our
power
to
influence
if
another
is
about
to
do
what
we
think
wrong
while
he
thinks
it
right
and
we
can
not
alter
his
belief
but
can
bring
other
motives
to
bear
on
him
that
may
overbalance
his
sense
of
duty
it
becomes
necessary
to
decide
whether
we
ought
thus
to
tempt
him
to
realise
what
we
believe
to
be
objectively
right
against
his
own
convictions
i
think
that
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
would
pronounce
against
such
temptation
thus
regarding
the
subjective
rightness
of
an
action
as
more
important
than
the
objective
unless
the
evil
of
the
act
prompted
by
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
appeared
to
be
very
grave
but
however
essential
it
may
be
that
a
moral
agent
should
do
what
he
believes
to
be
right
this
condition
of
right
conduct
is
too
simple
to
admit
of
systematic
development
it
is
therefore
clear
that
the
details
of
our
investigation
must
relate
mainly
to
objective
rightness
there
is
however
one
practical
rule
of
some
value
to
be
obtained
by
merely
reflecting
on
the
general
notion
of
rightness
as
commonly
conceived
in
a
previous
chapter
i
endeavoured
to
make
this
notion
clearer
by
saying
that
what
i
judge
to
be
right
must
unless
i
am
in
error
be
judged
to
be
so
by
all
rational
beings
who
judge
truly
of
the
this
statement
does
not
imply
that
what
is
judged
to
be
right
for
one
man
must
necessarily
be
judged
so
for
another
objective
rightness
may
vary
from
to
no
less
than
the
objective
facts
of
their
nature
and
circumstances
vary
there
seems
however
to
be
this
difference
between
our
conceptions
of
ethical
and
physical
objectivity
respectively
that
we
commonly
refuse
to
admit
in
the
case
of
the
former
what
experience
compels
us
to
admit
as
regards
the
latter
variations
for
which
we
can
discover
no
rational
explanation
in
the
variety
of
coexistent
physical
facts
we
find
an
accidental
or
arbitrary
element
in
which
we
have
to
acquiesce
as
we
can
not
conceive
it
to
be
excluded
by
any
extension
of
our
knowledge
of
physical
causation
if
we
ask
for
example
why
any
portion
of
space
empirically
known
to
us
contains
more
matter
than
any
similar
adjacent
portion
physical
science
can
only
answer
by
stating
along
with
certain
laws
of
change
some
antecedent
position
of
the
parts
of
matter
which
needs
explanation
no
less
than
the
present
and
however
far
back
we
carry
our
ascertainment
of
such
antecedent
positions
the
one
with
which
we
leave
off
seems
as
arbitrary
as
that
with
which
we
started
but
within
the
range
of
our
cognitions
of
right
and
wrong
it
will
be
generally
agreed
that
we
can
not
admit
a
similar
unexplained
variation
we
can
not
judge
an
action
to
be
right
for
and
wrong
for
unless
we
can
find
in
the
natures
or
circumstances
of
the
two
some
difference
which
we
can
regard
as
a
reasonable
ground
for
difference
in
their
duties
if
therefore
i
judge
any
action
to
be
right
for
myself
i
implicitly
judge
it
to
be
right
for
any
other
person
whose
nature
and
circumstances
do
not
differ
from
my
own
in
some
important
respects
now
by
making
this
latter
judgment
explicit
we
may
protect
ourselves
against
the
danger
which
besets
the
conscience
of
being
warped
and
perverted
by
strong
desire
so
that
we
too
easily
think
that
we
ought
to
do
what
we
very
much
wish
to
do
for
if
we
ask
ourselves
whether
we
believe
that
any
similar
person
in
similar
circumstances
ought
to
perform
the
contemplated
action
the
question
will
often
disperse
the
false
appearance
of
rightness
which
our
strong
inclination
has
given
to
it
we
see
that
we
should
not
think
it
right
for
another
and
therefore
that
it
can
not
be
right
for
us
indeed
this
test
of
the
rightness
of
our
volitions
is
so
generally
effective
that
kant
seems
to
have
held
that
all
particular
rules
of
duty
can
be
deduced
from
the
one
fundamental
rule
act
as
if
the
maxim
of
thy
action
were
to
become
by
thy
will
a
universal
law
of
but
this
appears
to
me
an
error
analogous
to
that
of
supposing
that
formal
logic
supplies
a
complete
criterion
of
truth
i
should
agree
that
a
volition
which
does
not
stand
this
test
is
to
be
condemned
but
i
hold
that
a
volition
which
does
stand
it
may
after
all
be
wrong
for
i
conceive
that
all
or
almost
all
persons
who
act
conscientiously
could
sincerely
will
the
maxims
on
which
they
act
to
be
universally
adopted
while
at
the
same
time
we
continually
find
such
persons
in
thoroughly
conscientious
disagreement
as
to
what
each
ought
to
do
in
a
given
set
of
circumstances
under
these
circumstances
to
say
that
all
such
persons
act
rightly
in
the
objective
sense
because
their
maxims
all
conform
to
kant
s
fundamental
rule
would
obliterate
altogether
the
distinction
between
subjective
and
objective
rightness
it
would
amount
to
affirming
that
whatever
any
one
thinks
right
is
so
unless
he
is
in
error
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case
to
which
his
judgment
applies
but
such
an
affirmation
is
in
flagrant
conflict
with
common
sense
and
would
render
the
construction
of
a
scientific
code
of
morality
futile
as
the
very
object
of
such
a
code
is
to
supply
a
standard
for
rectifying
men
s
divergent
opinions
we
may
conclude
then
that
the
moral
judgments
which
the
present
method
attempts
to
systematise
are
primarily
and
for
the
most
part
intuitions
of
the
rightness
or
goodness
or
the
reverse
of
particular
kinds
of
external
effects
of
human
volition
presumed
to
be
intended
by
the
agent
but
considered
independently
of
the
agent
s
own
view
as
to
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
his
intention
though
the
quality
of
motives
as
distinct
from
intentions
has
also
to
be
taken
into
account
but
the
question
may
be
raised
whether
it
is
legitimate
to
take
for
granted
as
i
have
hitherto
been
doing
the
existence
of
such
intuitions
and
no
doubt
there
are
persons
who
deliberately
deny
that
reflection
enables
them
to
discover
any
such
phenomenon
in
their
conscious
experience
as
the
judgment
or
apparent
perception
that
an
act
is
in
itself
right
or
good
in
any
other
sense
than
that
of
being
the
right
or
fit
means
to
the
attainment
of
some
ulterior
end
i
think
however
that
such
denials
are
commonly
recognised
as
paradoxical
and
opposed
to
the
common
experience
of
civilised
men
at
any
rate
if
the
psychological
question
as
to
the
of
such
moral
judgments
or
apparent
perceptions
of
moral
qualities
is
carefully
distinguished
from
the
ethical
question
as
to
their
and
from
what
we
may
call
the
psychogonical
question
as
to
their
the
first
and
second
of
these
questions
are
sometimes
confounded
owing
to
an
ambiguity
in
the
use
of
the
term
intuition
which
has
sometimes
been
understood
to
imply
that
the
judgment
or
apparent
perception
so
designated
is
i
wish
therefore
to
say
expressly
that
by
calling
any
affirmation
as
to
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
actions
intuitive
i
do
not
mean
to
prejudge
the
question
as
to
its
ultimate
validity
when
philosophically
considered
i
only
mean
that
its
truth
is
apparently
known
immediately
and
not
as
the
result
of
reasoning
i
admit
the
possibility
that
any
such
intuition
may
turn
out
to
have
an
element
of
error
which
subsequent
reflection
and
comparison
may
enable
us
to
correct
just
as
many
apparent
perceptions
through
the
organ
of
vision
are
found
to
be
partially
illusory
and
misleading
indeed
the
sequel
will
show
that
i
hold
this
to
be
to
an
important
extent
the
case
with
moral
intuitions
commonly
so
called
the
question
as
to
the
validity
of
moral
intuitions
being
thus
separated
from
the
simple
question
whether
they
actually
exist
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
latter
can
only
be
decided
for
each
person
by
direct
introspection
or
reflection
it
must
not
therefore
be
supposed
that
its
decision
is
a
simple
matter
introspection
being
always
infallible
on
the
contrary
experience
leads
me
to
regard
men
as
often
liable
to
confound
with
moral
intuitions
other
states
or
acts
of
mind
essentially
different
from
them
blind
impulses
to
certain
kinds
of
action
or
vague
sentiments
of
preference
for
them
or
conclusions
from
rapid
and
processes
of
reasoning
or
current
opinions
to
which
familiarity
has
given
an
illusory
air
of
but
any
errors
of
this
kind
due
to
careless
or
superficial
reflection
can
only
be
cured
by
more
careful
reflection
this
may
indeed
be
much
aided
by
communication
with
other
minds
it
may
also
be
aided
in
a
subordinate
way
by
an
inquiry
into
the
antecedents
of
the
apparent
intuition
which
may
suggest
to
the
reflective
mind
sources
of
error
to
which
a
superficial
view
of
it
is
liable
still
the
question
whether
a
certain
judgment
presents
itself
to
the
reflective
mind
as
intuitively
known
can
not
be
decided
by
any
inquiry
into
its
antecedents
or
causes
it
is
however
still
possible
to
hold
that
an
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
moral
intuitions
must
be
decisive
in
determining
their
validity
and
in
fact
it
has
been
often
assumed
both
by
intuitionists
and
their
opponents
that
if
our
moral
faculty
can
be
shown
to
be
derived
or
developed
out
of
other
elements
of
mind
or
consciousness
a
reason
is
thereby
given
for
distrusting
it
while
if
on
the
other
hand
it
can
be
shown
to
have
existed
in
the
human
mind
from
its
origin
its
trustworthiness
is
thereby
established
either
assumption
appears
to
me
devoid
of
foundation
on
the
one
hand
i
can
see
no
ground
for
supposing
that
a
faculty
thus
derived
is
as
such
more
liable
to
error
than
if
its
existence
in
the
individual
possessing
it
had
been
differently
caused
to
put
it
otherwise
i
can
not
see
how
the
mere
ascertainment
that
certain
apparently
judgments
have
been
caused
in
known
and
determinate
ways
can
be
in
itself
a
valid
ground
for
distrusting
this
class
of
apparent
cognitions
i
can
not
even
admit
that
those
who
affirm
the
truth
of
such
judgments
are
bound
to
show
in
their
causes
a
tendency
to
make
them
true
indeed
the
acceptance
of
any
such
would
seem
to
me
to
render
the
attainment
of
philosophical
certitude
impossible
for
the
premises
of
the
required
demonstration
must
consist
of
caused
beliefs
which
as
having
been
caused
will
equally
stand
in
need
of
being
proved
true
and
so
on
unless
it
be
held
that
we
can
find
among
the
premises
of
our
reasonings
certain
apparently
judgments
which
have
had
no
antecedent
causes
and
that
these
are
therefore
to
be
accepted
as
valid
without
proof
but
such
an
assertion
would
be
an
extravagant
paradox
and
if
it
be
admitted
that
all
beliefs
are
equally
in
the
position
of
being
effects
of
antecedent
causes
it
seems
evident
that
this
characteristic
alone
can
not
serve
to
invalidate
any
of
them
i
hold
therefore
that
the
must
be
thrown
the
other
way
those
who
dispute
the
validity
of
moral
or
other
intuitions
on
the
ground
of
their
derivation
must
be
required
to
show
not
merely
that
they
are
the
effects
of
certain
causes
but
that
these
causes
are
of
a
kind
that
tend
to
produce
invalid
beliefs
now
it
is
not
i
conceive
possible
to
prove
by
any
theory
of
the
derivation
of
the
moral
faculty
that
the
fundamental
ethical
conceptions
right
or
what
ought
to
be
done
good
or
what
it
is
reasonable
to
desire
and
seek
are
invalid
and
that
consequently
propositions
of
the
form
is
right
or
good
are
untrustworthy
for
such
ethical
propositions
relating
as
they
do
to
matter
fundamentally
different
from
that
with
which
physical
science
or
psychology
deals
can
not
be
inconsistent
with
any
physical
or
psychological
conclusions
they
can
only
be
shown
to
involve
error
by
being
shown
to
contradict
each
other
and
such
a
demonstration
can
not
lead
us
cogently
to
the
sweeping
conclusion
that
all
are
false
it
may
however
be
possible
to
prove
that
some
ethical
beliefs
have
been
caused
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
probable
that
they
are
wholly
or
partially
erroneous
and
it
will
hereafter
be
important
to
consider
how
far
any
ethical
intuitions
which
we
find
ourselves
disposed
to
accept
as
valid
are
open
to
attack
on
such
psychogonical
grounds
at
present
i
am
only
concerned
to
maintain
that
no
general
demonstration
of
the
derivedness
or
developedness
of
our
moral
faculty
can
supply
an
adequate
reason
for
distrusting
it
on
the
other
hand
if
we
have
been
once
led
to
distrust
our
moral
faculty
on
other
grounds
as
from
the
want
of
clearness
and
consistency
in
the
moral
judgments
of
the
same
individual
and
the
discrepancies
between
the
judgments
of
different
individuals
it
seems
to
me
equally
clear
that
our
confidence
in
such
judgments
can
not
properly
be
by
a
demonstration
of
their
i
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
original
element
of
our
moral
cognition
can
be
ascertained
but
if
it
could
i
see
no
reason
to
hold
that
it
would
be
especially
free
from
error
how
then
can
we
hope
to
eliminate
error
from
our
moral
intuitions
one
answer
to
this
question
was
briefly
suggested
in
a
previous
chapter
where
the
different
phases
of
the
intuitional
method
were
discussed
it
was
there
said
that
in
order
to
settle
the
doubts
arising
from
the
uncertainties
and
discrepancies
that
are
found
when
we
compare
our
judgments
on
particular
cases
reflective
persons
naturally
appeal
to
general
rules
or
formulæ
and
it
is
to
such
general
formulæ
that
intuitional
moralists
commonly
attribute
ultimate
certainty
and
validity
and
certainly
there
are
obvious
sources
of
error
in
our
judgments
respecting
concrete
duty
which
seem
to
be
absent
when
we
consider
the
abstract
notions
of
different
kinds
of
conduct
since
in
any
concrete
case
the
complexity
of
circumstances
necessarily
increases
the
difficulty
of
judging
and
our
personal
interests
or
habitual
sympathies
are
liable
to
disturb
the
clearness
of
our
moral
discernment
further
we
must
observe
that
most
of
us
feel
the
need
of
such
formulæ
not
only
to
correct
but
also
to
supplement
our
intuitions
respecting
particular
concrete
duties
only
exceptionally
confident
persons
find
that
they
always
seem
to
see
clearly
what
ought
to
be
done
in
any
case
that
comes
before
them
most
of
us
however
unhesitatingly
we
may
affirm
rightness
and
wrongness
in
ordinary
matters
of
conduct
yet
not
unfrequently
meet
with
cases
where
our
unreasoned
judgment
fails
us
and
where
we
could
no
more
decide
the
moral
issue
raised
without
appealing
to
some
general
formula
than
we
could
decide
a
disputed
legal
claim
without
reference
to
the
positive
law
that
deals
with
the
matter
and
such
formulæ
are
not
difficult
to
find
it
only
requires
a
little
reflection
and
observation
of
men
s
moral
discourse
to
make
a
collection
of
such
general
rules
as
to
the
validity
of
which
there
would
be
apparent
agreement
at
least
among
moral
persons
of
our
own
age
and
civilisation
and
which
would
cover
with
approximate
completeness
the
whole
of
human
conduct
such
a
collection
regarded
as
a
code
imposed
on
an
individual
by
the
public
opinion
of
the
community
to
which
he
belongs
we
have
called
the
positive
morality
of
the
community
but
when
regarded
as
a
body
of
moral
truth
warranted
to
be
such
by
the
of
mankind
or
at
least
of
that
portion
of
mankind
which
combines
adequate
intellectual
enlightenment
with
a
serious
concern
for
morality
it
is
more
significantly
termed
the
morality
of
common
sense
when
however
we
try
to
apply
these
currently
accepted
principles
we
find
that
the
notions
composing
them
are
often
deficient
in
clearness
and
precision
for
instance
we
should
all
agree
in
recognising
justice
and
veracity
as
important
virtues
and
we
shall
probably
all
accept
the
general
maxims
that
we
ought
to
give
every
man
his
own
and
that
we
ought
to
speak
the
truth
but
when
we
ask
whether
primogeniture
is
just
or
the
disendowment
of
corporations
or
the
determination
of
the
value
of
services
by
competition
or
whether
and
how
far
false
statements
may
be
allowed
in
speeches
of
advocates
or
in
religious
ceremonials
or
when
made
to
enemies
or
robbers
or
in
defence
of
lawful
secrets
we
do
not
find
that
these
or
any
other
current
maxims
enable
us
to
give
clear
and
unhesitating
decisions
and
yet
such
particular
questions
are
after
all
those
to
which
we
naturally
expect
answers
from
the
moralist
for
we
study
ethics
as
aristotle
says
for
the
sake
of
practice
and
in
practice
we
are
concerned
with
particulars
hence
it
seems
that
if
the
formulæ
of
intuitive
morality
are
really
to
serve
as
scientific
axioms
and
to
be
available
in
clear
and
cogent
demonstrations
they
must
first
be
raised
by
an
effort
of
reflection
which
ordinary
persons
will
not
make
to
a
higher
degree
of
precision
than
attaches
to
them
in
the
common
thought
and
discourse
of
mankind
in
general
we
have
in
fact
to
take
up
the
attempt
that
socrates
initiated
and
endeavour
to
define
satisfactorily
the
general
notions
of
duty
and
virtue
which
we
all
in
common
use
for
awarding
approbation
or
disapprobation
to
conduct
this
is
the
task
upon
which
we
shall
be
engaged
in
the
nine
chapters
that
follow
i
must
beg
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
that
throughout
these
chapters
i
am
not
trying
to
prove
or
disprove
intuitionism
but
merely
by
reflection
on
the
common
morality
which
i
and
my
reader
share
and
to
which
appeal
is
so
often
made
in
moral
disputes
to
obtain
as
explicit
exact
and
coherent
a
statement
as
possible
of
its
fundamental
rules
footnotes
see
it
may
seem
he
admits
that
since
interest
one
s
own
happiness
is
a
manifest
obligation
in
any
case
in
which
virtuous
action
appears
to
be
not
conducive
to
the
agent
s
interest
he
would
be
under
two
contrary
obligations
under
none
at
all
but
he
urges
the
obligation
on
the
side
of
interest
really
does
not
remain
for
the
natural
authority
of
the
principle
of
reflection
or
conscience
is
an
obligation
the
most
certain
and
known
whereas
the
contrary
obligation
can
at
the
utmost
appear
no
more
than
probable
since
no
man
can
be
in
any
circumstances
that
vice
is
his
interest
in
the
present
world
much
less
can
he
be
certain
against
another
and
thus
the
certain
obligation
would
entirely
supersede
and
destroy
the
uncertain
preface
to
butler
s
i
have
before
observed
book
chap
viii
that
in
the
common
notion
of
an
act
we
include
a
certain
portion
of
the
whole
series
of
changes
partly
caused
by
the
volition
which
initiated
the
act
some
would
add
character
and
but
since
characters
and
disposition
not
only
can
not
be
known
directly
but
can
only
be
definitely
conceived
by
reference
to
the
volitions
and
feelings
in
which
they
are
manifested
it
does
not
seem
to
me
possible
to
regard
them
as
the
primary
objects
of
intuitive
moral
judgments
see
chap
ii
of
this
book
no
doubt
we
hold
a
man
responsible
for
unintended
bad
consequences
of
his
acts
or
omissions
when
they
are
such
as
he
might
with
ordinary
care
have
foreseen
still
as
i
have
before
said
we
admit
on
reflection
that
moral
blame
only
attaches
to
such
careless
acts
or
omissions
indirectly
in
so
far
as
the
carelessness
is
the
result
of
some
previous
wilful
neglect
of
duty
i
think
that
common
usage
when
carefully
considered
will
be
found
to
admit
this
definition
suppose
a
nihilist
blows
up
a
railway
train
containing
an
emperor
and
other
persons
it
will
no
doubt
be
held
correct
to
say
simply
that
his
intention
was
to
kill
the
emperor
but
it
would
be
thought
absurd
to
say
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
the
other
persons
though
he
may
have
had
no
desire
to
kill
them
and
may
have
regarded
their
death
as
a
lamentable
incident
in
the
execution
of
his
revolutionary
plans
a
further
source
of
confusion
between
intention
and
motive
arises
from
the
different
points
of
view
from
which
either
may
be
judged
thus
an
act
may
be
one
of
a
series
which
the
agent
purposes
to
do
for
the
attainment
of
a
certain
end
and
our
moral
judgment
of
it
may
be
very
different
according
as
we
judge
the
intention
of
the
particular
act
or
the
general
intention
of
the
series
regarded
as
a
whole
either
point
of
view
is
legitimate
and
both
are
often
required
for
we
commonly
recognise
that
of
the
series
of
acts
which
a
man
does
to
attain
any
end
of
ambition
some
may
be
right
or
allowable
while
others
are
wrong
while
the
general
intention
to
attain
the
end
by
wrong
means
if
necessary
as
well
as
right
get
place
and
wealth
if
possible
with
grace
if
not
by
any
means
get
wealth
and
place
is
clearly
a
wrong
intention
so
again
in
judging
a
motive
to
be
good
or
bad
we
may
either
consider
it
simply
in
itself
or
in
connexion
with
other
balancing
and
controlling
motives
either
actually
present
along
with
it
or
absent
when
they
ought
to
be
present
thus
in
the
above
case
we
do
not
commonly
think
the
desire
for
wealth
or
rank
bad
in
itself
but
we
think
it
bad
as
the
sole
motive
of
a
statesman
s
public
career
it
is
easy
to
see
that
one
or
other
of
these
different
distinctions
is
apt
to
blend
with
and
confuse
the
simple
distinction
between
intention
and
motive
the
view
that
moral
judgments
relate
primarily
or
most
properly
to
motives
will
be
more
fully
discussed
in
chap
xii
of
this
book
i
use
these
alternative
terms
in
order
to
avoid
the
free
will
controversy
many
religious
persons
would
probably
say
that
the
motive
of
obedience
or
love
to
god
was
the
highest
but
those
who
take
this
view
would
generally
say
that
obedience
and
love
are
due
to
god
as
a
moral
being
possessing
the
attributes
of
infinite
wisdom
and
goodness
and
not
otherwise
and
if
so
these
religious
motives
would
seem
to
be
substantially
identical
with
regard
for
duty
and
love
of
virtue
though
modified
and
complicated
by
the
addition
of
emotions
belonging
to
relations
between
persons
locke

iv
i
do
not
myself
usually
employ
the
antithesis
of
form
and
matter
in
philosophical
exposition
as
it
appears
to
me
open
to
the
charge
of
obscurity
and
ambiguity
in
the
present
case
we
may
interpret
formal
rightness
as
denoting
at
once
a
and
and
a
or
condition
of
the
rightness
of
actions
it
is
not
i
conceive
commonly
held
to
be
indispensable
in
order
to
constitute
an
act
completely
right
that
a
belief
that
it
is
right
should
be
actually
present
in
the
agent
s
mind
it
might
be
completely
right
although
the
agent
never
actually
raised
the
question
of
its
rightness
or
wrongness
see
the
decision
would
i
think
usually
be
reached
by
weighing
bad
consequences
to
the
agent
s
character
against
bad
consequences
of
a
different
kind
in
extreme
cases
the
latter
consideration
would
certainly
prevail
in
the
view
of
common
sense
thus
we
should
generally
approve
a
statesman
who
crushed
a
dangerous
rebellion
by
working
on
the
fear
or
cupidity
of
a
leading
rebel
who
was
rebelling
on
conscientious
grounds
cf
book
iv
chap
iii
the
antithesis
of
subjective
and
objective
can
not
be
applied
to
the
condition
of
right
conduct
considered
in
this
paragraph
for
this
formal
condition
is
at
once
subjective
and
objective
being
as
i
argue
involved
in
our
common
notion
of
right
conduct
it
is
therefore
necessarily
judged
by
us
to
be
of
really
universal
application
and
though
it
does
not
secure
complete
objective
rightness
it
is
an
important
protection
against
objective
wrongness
cf
book
chap
iii
see
the
zur

pp

here

first
says
there
is
therefore
but
one
categorical
imperative
namely
this
only
on
that
maxim
whereby
thou
canst
at
the
same
time
will
that
it
should
become
a
universal
now
if
all
imperatives
of
duty
can
be
deduced
from
this
one
imperative
as
from
their
principle
we
shall
at
least
be
able
to
show
what
we
understand
by
duty
and
what
this
notion
he
then
demonstrates
the
application
of
the
principle
to
four
cases
selected
as
representative
of
the
many
actual
duties
and
continues
if
now
we
attend
to
ourselves
on
occasion
of
any
transgression
of
duty
we
shall
find
that
we
in
fact
do
not
will
that
our
maxim
should
be
a
universal
law
for
that
is
impossible
for
us
then
summing
up
the
conclusion
of
this
part
of
his
argument
he
says
we
have
exhibited
clearly
and
definitely
for
practical
the
content
of
the
categorical
imperative
which
must
contain
the
principle
of
all
duty
if
there
is
such
a
thing
at
i
do
not
mean
that
i
am
prepared
to
accept
kant
s
fundamental
maxim
in
the
precise
form
in
which
he
has
stated
it
but
the
qualifications
which
it
seems
to
me
to
require
will
be
more
conveniently
explained
later
see
book
chap
iii
i
can
not
doubt
that
every
one
of
our
cognitive
faculties
in
short
the
human
mind
as
a
whole
has
been
derived
and
developed
through
a
gradual
process
of
physical
change
out
of
some
lower
life
in
which
cognition
properly
speaking
had
no
place
on
this
view
the
distinction
between
original
and
derived
reduces
itself
to
that
between
prior
and
posterior
in
development
and
the
fact
that
the
moral
faculty
appears
somewhat
later
in
the
process
of
evolution
than
other
faculties
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
an
argument
against
the
validity
of
moral
intuition
especially
since
this
process
is
commonly
conceived
to
be
homogeneous
throughout
indeed
such
a
line
of
reasoning
would
be
suicidal
as
the
cognition
that
the
moral
faculty
is
developed
is
certainly
later
in
development
than
moral
cognition
and
would
therefore
by
this
reasoning
be
less
trustworthy

virtue
and
duty
before
however
we
attempt
to
define
particular
virtues
or
departments
of
duty
it
will
be
well
to
examine
further
the
notions
of
duty
and
virtue
in
general
and
the
relations
between
the
two
as
we
find
them
implicitly
conceived
by
the
common
sense
of
mankind
which
we
are
endeavouring
to
express
hitherto
i
have
taken
duty
to
be
broadly
convertible
with
right
conduct
i
have
noticed
however
that
the
former
term
like
ought
and
moral
obligation
implies
at
least
the
presence
of
motives
prompting
to
wrong
conduct
and
is
therefore
not
applicable
to
beings
to
whom
no
such
conflict
of
motives
can
be
attributed
thus
god
is
not
conceived
as
performing
duties
though
he
is
conceived
as
realising
justice
and
other
kinds
of
rightness
in
action
for
a
similar
reason
we
do
not
commonly
apply
the
term
duty
to
right
actions
however
necessary
and
important
when
we
are
so
strongly
impelled
to
them
by
inclinations
that
no
moral
impulse
is
conceived
to
be
necessary
for
their
performance
thus
we
do
not
say
generally
that
it
is
a
duty
to
eat
and
drink
enough
though
we
do
often
say
this
to
invalids
who
have
lost
their
appetite
we
should
therefore
perhaps
keep
most
close
to
usage
if
we
defined
duties
as
those
right
actions
or
abstinences
for
the
adequate
accomplishment
of
which
a
moral
impulse
is
conceived
to
be
at
least
occasionally
but
as
this
line
of
distinction
is
vague
and
continually
varying
i
shall
not
think
it
necessary
to
draw
attention
to
it
in
the
detailed
discussion
of
duties
it
seems
sufficient
to
point
out
that
we
shall
be
chiefly
concerned
with
such
right
conduct
as
comes
within
the
definition
just
suggested
it
may
be
said
however
that
there
is
another
implication
in
the
term
duty
which
i
have
so
far
overlooked
but
which
its
derivation
and
that
of
the
equivalent
term
obligation
plainly
indicates
viz
that
it
is
due
or
owed
to
some
one
but
i
think
that
here
the
derivation
does
not
govern
the
established
usage
rather
it
is
commonly
recognised
that
duties
owed
persons
or
relative
duties
are
only
one
species
and
that
some
duties
as
have
no
such
relativity
no
doubt
it
is
possible
to
view
any
duty
as
relative
to
the
person
or
persons
immediately
affected
by
its
performance
but
it
is
not
usual
to
do
this
where
the
immediate
effects
are
harmful
as
where
causes
a
physically
injurious
shock
to
the
person
addressed
and
though
it
may
still
be
conceived
to
be
ultimately
good
for
society
and
so
due
to
the
community
or
to
humanity
at
large
that
truth
should
even
in
this
case
be
spoken
this
conception
hardly
belongs
to
the
intuitional
view
that
truth
should
be
spoken
regardless
of
again
it
may
be
thought
by
religious
persons
that
the
performance
of
duties
is
owed
not
to
the
human
or
other
living
beings
affected
by
them
but
to
god
as
the
author
of
the
moral
law
and
i
certainly
would
not
deny
that
our
common
conception
of
duty
involves
an
implied
relation
of
an
individual
will
to
a
universal
will
conceived
as
perfectly
rational
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
affirm
that
this
implication
is
necessary
and
an
adequate
discussion
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
it
would
lead
to
metaphysical
controversies
which
i
am
desirous
of
avoiding
i
propose
therefore
in
this
exposition
of
the
intuitional
method
to
abstract
from
this
relation
of
duty
generally
to
a
divine
will
and
for
reasons
partly
similar
to
leave
out
of
consideration
the
particular
duties
to
god
which
intuitionists
have
often
distinguished
and
classified
our
view
of
the
general
rules
of
duty
to
man
or
to
other
animals
so
far
as
such
rules
are
held
to
be
cognisable
by
moral
intuition
will
i
conceive
remain
the
same
whether
or
not
we
regard
such
rules
as
imposed
by
a
supreme
rational
will
since
in
any
case
they
will
be
such
as
we
hold
it
rational
for
all
men
to
obey
and
therefore
such
as
a
supreme
reason
would
impose
i
shall
not
therefore
treat
the
term
duty
as
implying
necessarily
a
relation
either
to
a
universal
imponent
or
to
the
individuals
primarily
affected
by
the
performance
of
duties
but
shall
use
it
as
equivalent
generally
to
right
conduct
while
practically
concentrating
attention
on
acts
and
abstinences
for
which
a
moral
impulse
is
thought
to
be
more
or
less
required
the
notion
of
virtue
presents
more
complexity
and
difficulty
and
requires
to
be
discussed
from
different
points
of
view
we
may
begin
by
noticing
that
there
seem
to
be
some
particular
virtues
such
as
generosity
which
may
be
realised
in
acts
objectively
though
not
subjectively
wrong
from
want
of
insight
into
their
consequences
and
even
some
such
as
courage
which
may
be
exhibited
in
wrong
acts
that
are
known
by
the
agent
to
be
such
but
though
the
contemplation
of
such
acts
excites
in
us
a
admiration
in
the
latter
case
we
certainly
should
not
call
them
virtuous
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
should
do
so
in
the
former
case
if
we
were
using
the
term
strictly
it
will
therefore
involve
no
material
deviation
from
usage
if
we
limit
the
term
virtue
to
qualities
exhibited
in
right
conduct
accordingly
i
propose
to
adopt
this
limitation
in
subsequent
discussions
how
far
then
are
we
to
regard
the
spheres
of
duty
and
virtue
thus
defined
as
to
a
great
extent
they
undoubtedly
are
so
in
the
common
application
of
the
terms
but
not
altogether
since
in
its
common
use
each
term
seems
to
include
something
excluded
from
the
other
we
should
scarcely
say
that
it
was
virtuous
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
pay
one
s
debts
or
give
one
s
children
a
decent
education
or
keep
one
s
aged
parents
from
starving
these
being
duties
which
most
men
perform
and
only
bad
men
neglect
on
the
other
hand
there
are
acts
of
high
and
noble
virtue
which
we
commonly
regard
as
going
beyond
the
strict
duty
of
the
agent
since
while
we
praise
their
performance
we
do
not
condemn
their
here
however
a
difficulty
seems
to
arise
for
we
should
not
deny
that
it
is
in
some
sense
a
man
s
strict
duty
to
do
whatever
action
he
judges
most
excellent
so
far
as
it
is
in
his
power
but
can
we
say
that
it
is
as
much
in
a
man
s
power
to
realise
virtue
as
it
is
to
fulfil
duty
to
some
extent
no
doubt
we
should
say
this
no
quality
of
conduct
is
ever
called
a
virtue
unless
it
is
thought
to
be
some
immediately
attainable
at
will
by
all
ordinary
persons
when
circumstances
give
opportunity
for
its
manifestation
in
fact
the
line
between
virtues
and
other
excellences
of
behaviour
is
commonly
drawn
by
this
characteristic
of
voluntariness
an
excellence
which
we
think
no
effort
of
will
could
at
once
enable
us
to
exhibit
in
any
appreciable
degree
is
called
a
gift
grace
or
talent
but
not
properly
a
virtue
writers
like
hume
who
obliterate
this
line
diverge
manifestly
from
common
sense
still
i
regard
it
as
manifestly
paradoxical
to
maintain
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
any
one
at
any
time
to
realise
virtue
in
the
highest
form
or
degree
no
one
would
affirm
that
any
ordinary
man
can
at
will
exhibit
the
highest
degree
of
courage
in
the
sense
in
which
courage
is
a
virtue
when
occasion
arises
it
would
seem
therefore
that
we
can
distinguish
a
margin
of
virtuous
conduct
which
may
be
beyond
the
strict
duty
of
any
individual
as
being
beyond
his
power
can
we
then
excluding
this
margin
say
that
virtuous
conduct
so
far
as
it
is
in
a
man
s
power
coincides
completely
with
his
duty
certainly
we
should
agree
that
a
truly
moral
man
can
not
say
to
himself
this
is
the
best
thing
on
the
whole
for
me
to
do
but
yet
it
is
not
my
duty
to
do
it
though
it
is
in
my
power
this
would
certainly
seem
to
common
sense
an
immoral
paradox
and
yet
there
seem
to
be
acts
and
abstinences
which
we
praise
as
virtuous
without
imposing
them
as
duties
upon
all
who
are
able
to
do
them
as
for
a
rich
man
to
live
very
plainly
and
devote
his
income
to
works
of
public
beneficence
perhaps
we
may
harmonise
these
inconsistent
views
by
distinguishing
between
the
questions
what
a
man
ought
to
do
or
forbear
and
what
other
men
ought
to
blame
him
for
not
doing
or
forbearing
and
recognising
that
the
standard
normally
applied
in
dealing
with
the
latter
question
is
laxer
than
would
be
right
in
dealing
with
the
former
but
how
is
this
double
standard
to
be
explained
we
may
partly
explain
it
by
the
different
degrees
of
our
knowledge
in
the
two
cases
there
are
many
acts
and
forbearances
of
which
we
can
not
lay
down
definitely
that
they
ought
to
be
done
or
forborne
unless
we
have
the
complete
knowledge
of
circumstances
which
a
man
commonly
possesses
only
in
his
own
case
and
not
in
that
of
other
men
thus
i
may
easily
assure
myself
that
i
ought
to
subscribe
to
a
given
hospital
but
i
can
not
judge
whether
my
neighbour
ought
to
subscribe
as
i
do
not
know
the
details
of
his
income
and
the
claims
which
he
is
bound
to
satisfy
i
do
not
however
think
that
this
explanation
is
always
applicable
i
think
that
there
are
not
a
few
cases
in
which
we
refrain
from
blaming
others
for
the
omission
of
acts
which
we
do
not
doubt
that
we
in
their
place
should
have
thought
it
our
duty
to
perform
in
such
cases
the
line
seems
drawn
by
a
more
or
less
conscious
consideration
of
what
men
ordinarily
do
and
by
a
social
instinct
as
to
the
practical
effects
of
expressed
moral
approbation
and
disapprobation
we
think
that
moral
progress
will
on
the
whole
be
best
promoted
by
our
praising
acts
that
are
above
the
level
of
ordinary
practice
and
confining
our
censure
at
least
if
precise
and
particular
to
acts
that
fall
clearly
below
this
standard
but
a
standard
so
determined
must
be
inevitably
vague
and
tending
to
vary
as
the
average
level
of
morality
varies
in
any
community
or
section
of
a
community
indeed
it
is
the
aim
of
preachers
and
teachers
of
morality
to
raise
it
continually
hence
it
is
not
convenient
to
use
it
in
drawing
a
theoretical
line
between
virtue
and
duty
and
i
have
therefore
thought
it
best
to
employ
the
terms
so
that
virtuous
conduct
may
include
the
performance
of
duty
as
well
as
whatever
good
actions
may
be
commonly
thought
to
go
beyond
duty
though
recognising
that
virtue
in
its
ordinary
use
is
most
conspicuously
manifested
in
the
latter
so
far
i
have
been
considering
the
term
virtuous
as
applied
to
conduct
but
both
this
general
term
and
the
names
connoting
particular
virtues
just
liberal
brave
are
applied
to
persons
as
well
as
to
their
acts
and
the
question
may
be
raised
which
application
is
most
appropriate
or
primary
here
reflection
i
think
shows
that
these
attributes
are
not
thought
by
us
to
belong
to
acts
considered
apart
from
their
agents
so
that
virtue
seems
to
be
primarily
a
quality
of
the
soul
or
mind
conceived
as
permanent
in
comparison
with
the
transient
acts
and
feelings
in
which
it
is
manifested
as
so
conceived
it
is
widely
held
to
be
a
possession
worth
aiming
at
for
its
own
sake
to
be
in
fact
a
part
of
that
perfection
of
man
which
is
by
some
regarded
as
the
sole
ultimate
good
this
view
i
shall
consider
in
a
subsequent
chapter
meanwhile
it
may
be
observed
that
virtues
like
other
habits
and
dispositions
though
regarded
as
comparatively
permanent
attributes
of
the
mind
are
yet
attributes
of
which
we
can
only
form
definite
notions
by
conceiving
the
particular
transient
phenomena
in
which
they
are
manifested
if
then
we
ask
in
what
phenomena
virtuous
character
is
manifested
the
obvious
answer
is
that
it
is
manifested
in
voluntary
actions
so
far
as
intentional
or
more
briefly
in
volitions
and
many
perhaps
most
moralists
would
give
this
as
a
complete
answer
if
they
are
not
prepared
to
affirm
with
kant
that
a
good
will
is
the
only
absolute
and
unconditional
good
they
will
at
any
rate
agree
with
butler
that
the
object
of
the
moral
faculty
is
actions
comprehending
under
that
name
active
or
practical
principles
those
principles
from
which
men
would
act
if
occasions
and
circumstances
gave
them
and
if
it
be
urged
that
more
than
this
is
included
in
the
christian
conception
of
the
virtue
of
charity
the
love
of
our
neighbour
they
will
explain
with
kant
that
by
this
love
we
must
not
understand
the
emotion
of
affection
but
merely
the
resolution
to
benefit
which
alone
has
true
moral
i
do
not
however
think
that
the
complete
exclusion
of
an
emotional
element
from
the
conception
of
virtue
would
be
really
in
harmony
with
the
common
sense
of
mankind
i
think
that
in
our
common
moral
judgments
certain
kinds
of
virtuous
actions
are
held
to
be
at
any
rate
adorned
and
made
better
by
the
presence
of
certain
emotions
in
the
virtuous
agent
though
no
doubt
the
element
of
volition
is
the
more
important
and
indispensable
thus
the
virtue
of
chastity
or
purity
in
its
highest
form
seems
to
include
more
than
a
mere
settled
resolution
to
abstain
from
unlawful
lust
it
includes
some
sentiment
of
repugnance
to
impurity
again
we
recognise
that
benefits
which
spring
from
affection
and
are
lovingly
bestowed
are
more
acceptable
to
the
recipients
than
those
conferred
without
affection
in
the
taste
of
which
there
is
admittedly
something
harsh
and
dry
hence
in
a
certain
way
the
affection
if
practical
and
steady
seems
a
higher
excellence
than
the
mere
beneficent
disposition
of
the
will
as
resulting
in
more
excellent
acts
in
the
case
of
gratitude
even
the
rigidity
of
kant
seems
to
relax
and
to
admit
an
element
of
emotion
as
indispensable
to
the
virtue
and
there
are
various
other
notions
such
as
loyalty
and
patriotism
which
it
is
difficult
without
paradox
either
to
exclude
from
a
list
of
virtues
or
to
introduce
stripped
bare
of
all
emotional
elements
a
consideration
of
the
cases
last
mentioned
will
lead
us
to
conclude
that
in
the
view
of
common
sense
the
question
raised
in
the
preceding
chapter
whether
an
act
is
virtuous
in
proportion
as
it
was
done
from
regard
for
duty
or
virtue
must
be
answered
in
the
negative
for
the
degree
in
which
an
act
deserves
praise
as
courageous
loyal
or
patriotic
does
not
seem
to
be
reduced
by
its
being
shown
that
the
predominant
motive
to
the
act
was
natural
affection
and
not
love
of
virtue
as
such
indeed
in
some
cases
i
think
it
clear
that
we
commonly
attribute
virtue
to
conduct
where
regard
for
duty
or
virtue
is
not
consciously
present
at
all
as
in
the
case
of
a
heroic
act
of
courage
let
us
say
in
saving
a
from
death
under
an
impulse
of
spontaneous
sympathy
so
again
when
we
praise
a
man
as
genuinely
humble
we
certainly
do
not
imply
that
he
is
conscious
of
fulfilling
a
duty
still
less
that
he
is
conscious
of
exhibiting
a
virtue
by
being
humble
it
further
appears
to
me
that
in
the
case
of
many
important
virtues
we
do
not
commonly
consider
the
ultimate
spring
of
action
whether
it
be
some
emotional
impulse
or
the
rational
choice
of
duty
as
duty
in
attributing
a
particular
virtue
to
particular
persons
what
we
regard
as
indispensable
is
merely
a
settled
resolve
to
will
a
certain
kind
of
external
effects
thus
we
call
a
man
veracious
if
his
speech
exhibits
in
a
noteworthy
degree
a
settled
endeavour
to
produce
in
the
minds
of
others
impressions
exactly
correspondent
to
the
facts
whatever
his
motive
may
be
for
so
doing
whether
he
is
moved
solely
or
mainly
by
a
regard
for
virtue
or
a
sense
of
the
degradation
of
falsehood
or
a
conviction
that
is
in
the
long
run
the
best
policy
or
a
sympathetic
aversion
to
the
inconveniences
which
misleading
statements
cause
to
other
people
i
do
not
mean
that
we
regard
these
motives
as
of
equal
moral
value
but
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
any
one
or
other
of
them
is
not
implied
in
our
attribution
of
the
virtue
of
veracity
similarly
we
attribute
justice
if
a
man
has
a
settled
habit
of
weighing
diverse
claims
and
fulfilling
them
in
the
ratio
of
their
importance
good
faith
if
he
has
a
settled
habit
of
strictly
keeping
express
or
tacit
engagements
and
so
forth
even
where
we
clearly
take
motives
into
account
in
judging
of
the
degree
of
virtue
it
is
often
rather
the
force
of
seductive
motives
resisted
than
the
particular
nature
of
the
prevailing
springs
of
action
which
we
consider
thus
we
certainly
think
virtue
has
been
manifested
in
a
higher
degree
in
just
or
veracious
conduct
when
the
agent
had
strong
temptations
to
be
unjust
or
unveracious
and
in
the
same
way
there
are
certain
dispositions
or
habits
tending
to
good
conduct
which
are
called
virtues
when
there
are
powerful
seductive
motives
operating
and
not
otherwise
when
we
attribute
the
virtue
of
temperance
to
a
man
who
eats
and
drinks
a
proper
amount
it
is
because
we
also
attribute
to
him
appetites
prompting
to
excess
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
common
sense
seems
liable
to
some
perplexity
as
to
the
relation
of
virtue
to
the
moral
effort
required
for
resisting
unvirtuous
impulses
on
the
one
hand
a
general
assent
would
be
given
to
the
proposition
that
virtue
is
especially
drawn
out
and
exhibited
in
a
successful
conflict
with
natural
inclination
and
perhaps
even
to
the
more
extreme
statement
that
there
is
no
virtue
in
doing
what
one
likes
on
the
other
hand
we
should
surely
agree
with
aristotle
that
virtue
is
imperfect
so
long
as
the
agent
can
not
do
the
virtuous
action
without
a
conflict
of
impulses
since
it
is
from
a
wrong
bent
of
natural
impulse
that
we
find
it
hard
to
do
what
is
best
and
it
seems
absurd
to
say
that
the
more
we
cure
ourselves
of
this
wrong
bent
the
less
virtuous
we
grow
perhaps
we
may
solve
the
difficulty
by
recognising
that
our
common
idea
of
virtue
includes
two
distinct
elements
the
one
being
the
most
perfect
ideal
of
moral
excellence
that
we
are
able
to
conceive
for
human
beings
while
the
other
is
manifested
in
the
effort
of
imperfect
men
to
attain
this
ideal
thus
in
proportion
as
a
man
comes
to
like
any
particular
kind
of
good
conduct
and
to
do
it
without
moral
effort
we
shall
not
say
that
his
conduct
becomes
less
virtuous
but
rather
more
in
conformity
with
a
true
moral
ideal
while
at
the
same
time
we
shall
recognise
that
in
this
department
of
his
life
he
has
less
room
to
exhibit
that
other
kind
of
virtue
which
is
manifested
in
resistance
to
seductive
impulses
and
in
the
energetic
striving
of
the
will
to
get
nearer
to
ideal
perfection
so
far
i
have
been
considering
the
manifestation
of
virtue
in
emotions
and
volitions
and
have
not
expressly
adverted
to
the
intellectual
conditions
of
virtuous
acts
though
in
speaking
of
such
acts
it
is
of
course
implied
that
the
volition
is
accompanied
with
an
intellectual
representation
of
the
particular
effects
willed
it
is
not
however
implied
that
in
willing
such
effects
we
must
necessarily
think
of
them
as
right
or
good
and
i
do
not
myself
think
that
in
the
view
of
common
sense
this
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
virtuousness
of
an
act
for
it
seems
that
some
kinds
of
virtuous
acts
may
be
done
so
entirely
without
deliberation
that
no
moral
judgment
was
passed
on
them
by
the
agent
this
might
be
the
case
for
instance
with
an
act
of
heroic
courage
prompted
by
an
impulse
of
sympathy
with
a
in
sudden
peril
but
it
is
i
conceive
clearly
necessary
that
such
an
act
should
not
be
even
vaguely
thought
to
be
bad
as
i
have
already
said
it
is
more
doubtful
how
far
an
act
which
is
conceived
by
the
agent
to
be
good
but
which
is
really
bad
is
ever
judged
by
common
sense
to
be
virtuous
but
if
we
agree
to
restrict
the
term
to
acts
which
we
regard
as
right
it
is
again
obvious
that
the
realisation
of
virtue
may
not
be
in
the
power
of
any
given
person
at
any
given
time
through
lack
of
the
requisite
intellectual
conditions
to
sum
up
the
results
of
a
rather
complicated
discussion
i
consider
virtue
as
a
quality
manifested
in
the
performance
of
duty
or
good
acts
going
beyond
strict
duty
it
is
indeed
primarily
attributed
to
the
mind
or
character
of
the
agent
but
it
is
only
known
to
us
through
its
manifestations
in
feelings
and
acts
accordingly
in
endeavouring
to
make
precise
our
conceptions
of
the
particular
virtues
we
have
to
examine
the
states
of
consciousness
in
which
they
are
manifested
examining
these
we
find
that
the
element
of
volition
is
primarily
important
and
in
some
cases
almost
of
sole
importance
but
yet
that
the
element
of
emotion
can
not
be
altogether
discarded
without
palpable
divergence
from
common
sense
again
concentrating
our
attention
on
the
volitional
element
we
find
that
in
most
cases
what
we
regard
as
manifestations
of
virtue
are
the
volitions
to
produce
certain
particular
effects
the
general
determination
to
do
right
as
right
duty
for
duty
s
sake
is
indeed
thought
to
be
of
fundamental
importance
as
a
generally
necessary
spring
of
virtuous
action
but
it
is
not
thought
to
be
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
existence
of
virtue
in
any
particular
case
similarly
in
considering
the
emotional
element
though
an
ardent
love
of
virtue
or
aversion
to
vice
generally
is
a
valuable
stimulus
to
virtuous
conduct
it
is
not
a
universally
necessary
condition
of
it
and
in
the
case
of
some
acts
the
presence
of
other
emotions
such
as
kind
affection
makes
the
acts
better
than
if
they
were
done
from
a
purely
moral
motive
such
emotions
however
can
not
be
commanded
at
will
and
this
is
also
true
of
the
knowledge
of
what
ought
to
be
done
in
any
particular
case
which
if
we
restrict
the
term
virtuous
to
right
acts
is
obviously
required
to
render
conduct
perfectly
virtuous
for
these
and
other
reasons
i
consider
that
though
virtue
is
distinguished
by
us
from
other
excellences
by
the
characteristic
of
voluntariness
it
must
be
some
capable
of
being
realised
at
will
when
occasion
arises
this
voluntariness
attaches
to
it
only
in
a
certain
degree
and
that
though
a
man
can
always
do
his
duty
if
he
knows
it
he
can
not
always
realise
virtue
in
the
highest
degree
it
should
however
be
observed
that
even
when
it
is
beyond
our
power
to
realise
virtue
immediately
at
will
we
recognise
a
duty
of
cultivating
it
and
seeking
to
develop
it
and
this
duty
of
cultivation
extends
to
all
virtuous
habits
or
dispositions
in
which
we
are
found
to
be
deficient
so
far
as
we
can
thus
increase
our
tendency
to
do
the
corresponding
acts
in
future
however
completely
such
acts
may
on
each
occasion
be
within
the
control
of
the
will
it
is
true
that
for
acts
of
this
latter
kind
so
far
as
they
are
perfectly
deliberate
we
do
not
seem
to
need
any
special
virtuous
habits
if
only
we
have
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
best
to
be
done
together
with
a
sufficiently
strong
wish
to
do
it
but
in
order
to
fulfil
our
duties
thoroughly
we
are
obliged
to
act
during
part
of
our
lives
suddenly
and
without
deliberation
on
such
occasions
there
is
no
room
for
moral
reasoning
and
sometimes
not
even
for
explicit
moral
judgment
so
that
in
order
to
act
virtuously
we
require
such
particular
habits
and
dispositions
as
are
denoted
by
the
names
of
the
special
virtues
and
it
is
a
duty
to
foster
and
develop
these
in
whatever
way
experience
shows
this
to
be
possible
the
complicated
relation
of
virtue
to
duty
as
above
determined
must
be
borne
in
mind
throughout
the
discussion
of
the
particular
virtues
to
which
i
shall
proceed
in
the
following
chapters
but
as
we
have
seen
the
main
part
of
the
manifestation
of
virtue
in
conduct
consists
in
voluntary
actions
which
it
is
within
the
power
of
any
individual
to
do
so
far
as
they
are
recognised
by
him
as
right
and
which
therefore
come
within
our
definition
of
duty
as
above
laid
down
it
will
not
therefore
be
necessary
during
the
greater
part
of
the
ensuing
discussion
to
distinguish
between
principles
of
virtuous
conduct
and
principles
of
duty
since
the
definitions
of
the
two
will
coincide
here
however
a
remark
is
necessary
which
to
some
extent
qualifies
what
was
said
in
the
preceding
chapter
where
i
characterised
the
common
notions
of
particular
virtues
justice
as
too
vague
to
furnish
exact
determinations
of
the
actions
enjoined
under
them
i
there
assumed
that
rules
of
duty
ought
to
admit
of
precise
definition
in
a
universal
form
and
this
assumption
naturally
belongs
to
the
ordinary
or
jural
view
of
ethics
as
concerned
with
a
moral
code
since
we
should
agree
that
if
obligations
are
imposed
on
any
one
he
ought
at
least
to
know
what
they
are
and
that
a
law
indefinitely
drawn
must
be
a
bad
law
but
so
far
as
we
contemplate
virtue
as
something
that
goes
beyond
strict
duty
and
is
not
always
capable
of
being
realised
at
will
this
assumption
is
not
so
clearly
appropriate
since
from
this
point
of
view
we
naturally
compare
excellence
of
conduct
with
beauty
in
the
products
of
the
fine
arts
of
such
products
we
commonly
say
that
though
rules
and
definite
prescriptions
may
do
much
they
can
never
do
all
that
the
highest
excellence
is
always
due
to
an
instinct
or
tact
that
can
not
be
reduced
to
definite
formulæ
we
can
describe
the
beautiful
products
when
they
are
produced
and
to
some
extent
classify
their
beauties
giving
names
to
each
but
we
can
not
prescribe
any
certain
method
for
producing
each
kind
of
beauty
so
it
may
be
said
stands
the
case
with
virtues
and
hence
the
attempt
to
state
an
explicit
maxim
by
applying
which
we
may
be
sure
of
producing
virtuous
acts
of
any
kind
must
fail
we
can
only
give
a
general
account
of
the
virtue
a
description
not
a
definition
and
leave
it
to
trained
insight
to
find
in
any
particular
circumstances
the
act
that
will
best
realise
it
on
this
view
which
i
may
distinguish
as
æsthetic
intuitionism
i
shall
have
something
to
say
hereafter
but
i
conceive
that
our
primary
business
is
to
examine
the
larger
claims
of
those
rational
or
jural
intuitionists
who
maintain
that
ethics
admits
of
exact
and
scientific
treatment
having
for
its
first
principles
the
general
rules
of
which
we
have
spoken
or
the
most
fundamental
of
them
and
who
thus
hold
out
to
us
a
hope
of
getting
rid
of
the
fluctuations
and
discrepancies
of
opinion
in
which
we
acquiesce
in
æsthetic
discussions
but
which
tend
to
endanger
seriously
the
authority
of
ethical
beliefs
and
we
can
not
i
think
decide
on
the
validity
of
such
claims
without
examining
in
detail
the
propositions
which
have
been
put
forward
as
ethical
axioms
and
seeing
how
far
they
prove
to
be
clear
and
explicit
or
how
far
others
may
be
suggested
presenting
these
qualities
for
it
would
not
be
maintained
at
least
by
the
more
judicious
thinkers
of
this
school
that
such
axioms
are
always
to
be
found
with
proper
exactness
of
form
by
mere
observation
of
the
common
moral
reasonings
of
men
but
rather
that
they
are
at
least
implied
in
these
reasonings
and
that
when
made
explicit
their
truth
is
and
must
be
accepted
at
once
by
an
intelligent
and
unbiassed
mind
just
as
some
mathematical
axioms
are
not
and
can
not
be
known
to
the
multitude
as
their
certainty
can
not
be
seen
except
by
minds
carefully
prepared
but
yet
when
their
terms
are
properly
understood
the
perception
of
their
absolute
truth
is
immediate
and
irresistible
similarly
if
we
are
not
able
to
claim
for
a
proposed
moral
axiom
in
its
precise
form
an
explicit
and
actual
assent
of
it
may
still
be
a
truth
which
men
before
vaguely
apprehended
and
which
they
will
now
unhesitatingly
admit
in
this
inquiry
it
is
not
of
great
importance
in
what
order
we
take
the
virtues
we
are
not
to
examine
the
system
of
any
particular
moralist
but
the
morality
as
it
was
called
of
common
sense
and
the
discussion
of
the
general
notions
of
duty
and
virtue
in
which
we
have
been
engaged
in
the
present
chapter
will
have
shown
incidentally
the
great
difficulty
of
eliciting
from
common
sense
any
clear
principle
of
classification
of
the
particular
duties
and
virtues
hence
i
have
thought
it
best
to
reserve
what
i
have
to
say
on
the
subject
of
classification
till
a
later
period
of
the
discussion
and
in
the
first
place
to
take
the
matter
to
be
investigated
quite
empirically
as
we
find
it
in
the
common
thought
expressed
in
the
common
language
of
mankind
the
systems
of
moralists
commonly
attempt
to
give
some
definite
arrangement
to
this
crude
material
but
in
so
far
as
they
are
systematic
they
generally
seem
forced
to
transcend
common
sense
and
define
what
it
has
left
doubtful
as
i
shall
hereafter
try
to
show
for
the
present
then
it
seems
best
in
this
empirical
investigation
to
take
the
virtues
rather
in
the
order
of
their
importance
and
as
there
are
some
that
seem
to
have
a
special
comprehensiveness
of
range
and
to
include
under
them
in
a
manner
all
or
most
of
the
others
it
will
be
convenient
to
begin
with
these
of
these
wisdom
is
perhaps
the
most
obvious
in
the
next
chapter
therefore
i
propose
to
examine
our
common
conceptions
of
wisdom
and
certain
other
cognate
or
connected
virtues
or
excellences
footnotes
it
is
more
convenient
for
the
purpose
of
expounding
the
morality
of
common
sense
to
understand
by
virtue
a
quality
exhibited
in
right
conduct
for
then
we
can
use
the
common
notions
of
the
particular
virtues
as
heads
for
the
classification
of
the
most
important
kinds
or
aspects
of
right
conduct
as
generally
recognised
and
i
think
that
this
employment
of
the
term
is
as
much
in
accordance
with
ordinary
usage
as
any
other
equally
precise
use
would
be
in
book
chap
i
have
explained
the
sense
in
which
determinists
no
less
than
libertarians
hold
that
it
is
in
a
man
s
power
to
do
his
duty
cf
concerning
the
principles
of
appendix
iv
if
the
phrase
in
the
text
were
used
by
a
moral
person
with
a
sincere
and
predominant
desire
to
do
his
duty
it
must
i
conceive
be
used
in
one
of
two
senses
either
in
recognition
of
a
customary
standard
of
virtuous
conduct
which
the
speaker
is
not
prepared
expressly
to
dispute
but
which
he
does
not
really
adopt
as
valid
as
when
we
say
that
it
would
be
virtuous
to
read
a
new
book
hear
a
sermon
pay
a
visit
etc
or
it
might
be
used
loosely
to
mean
that
such
and
such
conduct
be
best
if
the
speaker
were
differently
constituted
chap
xiv
of
this
book
cf
anf
diese
tugend
welche
mit
innigkeit
der
wohlwollenden
gesinnung
zugleich
zärtlichkeit
des
wohlwollens
or
no
merit
but
so
far
as
this
latter
notion
is
precisely
applied
it
will
be
more
appropriately
considered
in
ch
of
this
book
on
justice
i
have
before
said
that
decidedly
wrong
acts
are
frequently
considered
to
exhibit
in
a
high
degree
the
tendencies
which
when
exhibited
in
right
acts
we
call
particular
virtues
generosity
courage
patriotism
etc
and
this
is
especially
true
of
acts
bad
through
ignorance
this
i
think
is
a
conclusion
which
common
sense
on
the
whole
accepts
though
i
note
a
considerable
reluctance
to
accept
it
which
however
is
not
shown
in
the
attribution
of
virtue
to
persons
who
do
clearly
wrong
acts
but
rather
in
an
effort
to
explain
their
ignorance
as
caused
by
some
previous
wilful
wrongdoing
we
try
to
persuade
ourselves
that
if
torquemada
did
not
know
that
it
was
wrong
to
torture
heretics
he
might
have
known
if
he
had
not
wilfully
neglected
means
of
enlightenment
but
there
are
many
cases
in
which
this
kind
of
explanation
is
unsupported
by
facts
and
i
see
no
ground
for
accepting
it
as
generally
true
hence
the
socratic
doctrine
that
all
virtue
is
knowledge
on
the
assumption
that
a
rational
being
must
necessarily
wish
for
what
is
good

was
always
placed
by

in

list

and
regarded
as
in

comprehending
all
the
others
in
fact
in
the
schools
the
notion
of

common
greek
usage
however
the
term
just
mentioned
would
signify
excellence
in
purely
speculative
science
no
less
than
practical
wisdom
and
the
english
term
wisdom
has
to
some
extent
the
same
ambiguity
it
is
however
chiefly
used
in
reference
to
practice
and
even
when
applied
to
the
region
of
pure
speculation
suggests
especially
such
intellectual
gifts
and
habits
as
lead
to
sound
practical
conclusions
namely
comprehensiveness
of
view
the
habit
of
attending
impartially
to
a
number
of
diverse
considerations
difficult
to
estimate
exactly
and
good
judgment
as
to
the
relative
importance
of
each
at
any
rate
it
is
only
practical
wisdom
which
we
commonly
class
among
virtues
as
distinguished
from
purely
intellectual
excellences
how
then
shall
we
define
practical
wisdom
the
most
obvious
part
of
its
meaning
is
a
tendency
to
discern
in
the
conduct
of
life
generally
the
best
means
to
the
attainment
of
any
ends
that
the
natural
play
of
human
motives
may
lead
us
to
seek
as
contrasted
with
technical
skill
or
the
faculty
of
selecting
the
best
means
to
given
ends
in
a
certain
limited
and
special
department
of
human
action
such
skill
in
the
special
arts
is
partly
communicable
by
means
of
definite
rules
and
partly
a
matter
of
tact
or
instinct
depending
somewhat
on
natural
gifts
and
predispositions
but
to
a
great
extent
acquired
by
exercise
and
imitation
and
similarly
practical
wisdom
if
understood
to
be
skill
in
the
art
of
life
would
involve
a
certain
amount
of
scientific
knowledge
the
portions
of
different
sciences
bearing
directly
on
human
action
together
with
empirical
rules
relating
to
the
same
and
also
the
tact
or
trained
instinct
just
mentioned
which
would
even
be
more
prominent
here
on
account
of
the
extreme
complexity
of
the
but
it
does
not
appear
from
this
analysis
why
this
skill
should
be
regarded
as
a
virtue
and
reflection
will
show
that
we
do
not
ordinarily
mean
by
wisdom
merely
the
faculty
of
finding
the
best
means
to
any
ends
for
we
should
not
call
the
most
accomplished
swindler
wise
whereas
we
should
not
hesitate
to
attribute
to
him
cleverness
ingenuity
and
other
purely
intellectual
excellences
so
again
we
apply
the
term
to
a
man
who
skilfully
chooses
the
best
means
to
the
end
of
ambition
but
we
should
not
call
such
a
man
wise
without
qualification
wisdom
in
short
appears
to
me
to
imply
right
judgment
in
respect
of
ends
as
well
as
means
here
however
a
subtle
question
arises
for
the
assumption
on
which
this
treatise
proceeds
is
that
there
are
several
ultimate
ends
of
action
which
all
claim
to
be
rational
ends
such
as
every
man
ought
to
adopt
hence
if
wisdom
implies
right
judgment
as
to
ends
it
is
clear
that
a
person
who
regards
some
one
end
as
the
sole
right
or
rational
ultimate
end
will
not
consider
a
man
wise
who
adopts
any
other
ultimate
end
can
we
say
then
that
in
the
common
use
of
the
word
wisdom
any
one
ultimate
end
is
distinctly
implied
to
the
exclusion
of
others
it
may
be
suggested
perhaps
that
in
the
moral
view
of
common
sense
which
we
are
now
trying
to
make
clear
since
wisdom
itself
is
prescribed
or
commended
as
a
quality
of
conduct
intuitively
discerned
to
be
right
or
good
the
ultimate
end
which
the
wise
man
prefers
must
be
just
this
attainment
of
rightness
or
goodness
in
conduct
generally
rather
than
pleasure
for
himself
or
others
or
any
other
ulterior
end
i
think
however
that
in
the
case
of
this
notion
it
is
impossible
to
carry
out
that
analysis
of
ordinary
practical
reasoning
into
several
distinct
methods
each
admitting
and
needing
separate
development
upon
which
the
plan
of
this
treatise
is
founded
for
as
we
saw
it
is
characteristic
of
common
sense
to
assume
coincidence
or
harmony
among
these
different
competing
methods
and
hence
while
as
regards
most
particular
virtues
and
duties
the
exercise
of
moral
judgment
in
ordinary
men
is
independent
of
hedonistic
calculations
and
occasionally
in
apparent
conflict
with
their
results
so
that
the
reconciliation
of
the
different
procedures
presents
itself
as
a
problem
to
be
solved
in
the
comprehensive
notion
of
wisdom
the
antagonism
is
latent
common
sense
seems
to
mean
by
a
wise
man
a
man
who
attains
at
once
all
the
different
rational
ends
who
by
conduct
in
perfect
conformity
with
the
true
moral
code
attains
the
greatest
happiness
possible
both
for
himself
and
for
mankind
or
that
portion
of
mankind
to
which
his
efforts
are
necessarily
restricted
but
if
we
find
this
harmony
unattainable
if
for
example
rational
egoism
seems
to
lead
to
conduct
opposed
to
the
true
interests
of
mankind
in
general
and
we
ask
whether
we
are
to
call
wise
the
man
who
seeks
or
him
who
sacrifices
his
private
interests
common
sense
gives
no
clear
reply
let
us
now
return
to
the
question
whether
wisdom
as
exhibited
in
right
judgment
as
to
ends
is
in
any
degree
attainable
at
will
and
so
according
to
our
definition
a
virtue
at
first
sight
the
perception
of
the
right
end
may
seem
not
to
be
voluntary
any
more
than
the
cognition
of
any
other
kind
of
truth
and
though
in
most
cases
the
attainment
of
truth
requires
voluntary
effort
still
we
do
not
generally
think
it
possible
for
any
man
by
this
alone
to
attain
even
approximately
the
right
solution
of
a
difficult
intellectual
problem
it
is
often
said
however
that
the
cognition
of
moral
truth
depends
largely
upon
the
heart
that
is
upon
a
certain
condition
of
our
desires
and
other
emotions
and
it
would
seem
to
be
on
this
view
that
wisdom
is
regarded
as
a
virtue
and
we
may
admit
it
as
such
according
to
the
definition
before
given
so
far
as
this
condition
of
feeling
is
attainable
at
will
still
on
closer
scrutiny
there
hardly
seems
to
be
agreement
as
to
the
right
emotional
conditions
of
the
cognition
of
ends
as
some
would
say
that
prayer
or
ardent
aspiration
produced
the
most
favourable
state
while
others
would
urge
that
emotional
excitement
is
likely
to
perturb
the
judgment
and
would
say
that
we
need
for
right
apprehension
rather
tranquillity
of
feeling
and
some
would
contend
that
a
complete
suppression
of
selfish
impulses
was
the
essential
condition
while
others
would
regard
this
as
chimerical
and
impossible
or
if
possible
a
plain
misdirection
of
effort
on
these
points
we
can
not
decide
in
the
name
of
common
sense
but
it
would
be
generally
agreed
that
there
are
certain
violent
passions
and
sensual
appetites
which
are
known
to
be
liable
to
pervert
moral
apprehensions
and
that
these
are
to
some
extent
under
the
control
of
the
will
so
that
a
man
who
exercises
moral
effort
to
resist
their
influence
when
he
wishes
to
decide
on
ends
of
action
may
be
said
to
be
so
far
voluntarily
wise
and
this
applies
to
some
extent
even
to
that
other
function
of
wisdom
first
discussed
which
consists
in
the
selection
of
the
best
means
to
the
attainment
of
given
ends
for
experience
seems
to
show
that
our
insight
in
practical
matters
is
liable
to
be
perverted
by
desire
and
fear
and
that
this
perversion
may
be
prevented
by
an
effort
of
so
that
unwisdom
even
here
is
at
least
not
altogether
involuntary
thus
in
a
dispute
which
may
lead
to
a
quarrel
i
may
be
entirely
unable
to
show
foresight
and
skill
in
maintaining
my
right
in
such
a
manner
as
to
avoid
needless
exasperation
and
so
far
may
be
unable
to
conduct
the
dispute
wisely
but
it
is
always
in
my
power
before
taking
each
important
step
to
reduce
the
influence
of
anger
or
wounded
on
my
decisions
and
i
may
avoid
much
unwisdom
in
this
way
and
it
is
to
be
observed
that
volition
has
a
more
important
part
to
play
in
developing
or
protecting
our
insight
into
the
right
conduct
of
life
than
it
has
in
respect
of
the
technical
skill
to
which
we
compared
practical
wisdom
in
proportion
as
the
reasonings
in
which
practical
wisdom
is
exhibited
are
less
clear
and
exact
and
the
conclusions
inevitably
more
uncertain
for
desire
and
fear
could
hardly
make
one
go
wrong
in
an
arithmetical
calculation
but
in
estimating
a
balance
of
complicated
practical
probabilities
it
is
more
difficult
to
resist
the
influence
of
strong
inclination
and
it
would
seem
to
be
a
more
or
less
definite
consciousness
of
the
continual
need
of
such
resistance
which
leads
us
to
regard
wisdom
as
a
virtue
we
may
say
then
that
practical
wisdom
so
far
as
it
is
a
virtue
involves
a
habit
of
resistance
to
desires
and
fears
which
is
commonly
distinguished
as
but
suppose
a
man
has
determined
with
full
insight
the
course
of
conduct
that
it
is
reasonable
for
him
to
adopt
under
any
given
circumstances
the
question
still
remains
whether
he
will
certainly
adopt
it
now
i
hardly
think
that
common
sense
considers
the
as
distinct
from
the
of
right
ends
to
belong
to
wisdom
and
yet
we
should
scarcely
call
a
man
wise
who
deliberately
chose
to
do
what
he
knew
to
be
contrary
to
reason
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
the
notion
of
such
a
choice
though
the
modern
mind
admits
it
as
possible
is
somewhat
unfamiliar
in
comparison
with
either
impulsive
irrationality
or
mistaken
choice
of
bad
for
good
in
the
last
case
if
the
mistake
is
entirely
involuntary
the
choice
has
of
course
no
subjective
wrongness
often
however
the
mistaken
conclusion
is
caused
by
a
perverting
influence
of
desire
or
fear
of
which
the
agent
is
obscurely
conscious
and
which
might
be
resisted
and
dispelled
by
an
effort
of
will
as
so
caused
the
mistake
falls
under
the
head
of
culpable
unwisdom
due
to
want
of
similar
in
kind
though
not
in
degree
to
that
which
is
exhibited
in
the
rarer
phenomenon
of
a
man
deliberately
choosing
to
do
what
he
knows
to
be
bad
for
him
the
case
of
impulsive
wrongdoing
is
somewhat
different
it
is
clear
that
a
resolution
made
after
deliberation
in
accordance
with
our
view
of
what
is
right
should
not
be
abandoned
or
modified
except
deliberately
at
least
if
time
for
fresh
deliberation
be
allowed
and
the
required
to
resist
impulses
prompting
to
such
abandonment
or
modification
which
we
may
perhaps
call
firmness
is
an
indispensable
auxiliary
to
wisdom
but
the
gusts
of
impulse
that
the
varying
occasions
of
life
arouse
sometimes
take
effect
so
rapidly
that
the
resolution
to
which
they
run
counter
is
not
actually
recalled
at
the
time
and
in
this
case
the
or
firmness
required
to
prevent
unreasonable
action
seems
to
be
not
attainable
at
will
when
it
is
most
wanted
we
can
however
cultivate
this
important
habit
by
graving
our
resolves
deeper
in
the
moments
of
deliberation
that
continually
intervene
among
the
moments
of
impulsive
action
in
examining
the
functions
of
wisdom
other
subordinate
excellences
come
into
view
which
are
partly
included
in
our
ideal
conception
of
wisdom
and
partly
auxiliary
or
supplementary
some
of
these
however
no
one
would
exactly
call
virtues
such
as
sagacity
in
selecting
the
really
important
points
amid
a
crowd
of
others
acuteness
in
seeing
aids
or
obstacles
that
lie
somewhat
hidden
ingenuity
in
devising
subtle
or
complicated
means
to
our
ends
and
other
cognate
qualities
more
or
less
vaguely
defined
and
named
we
can
not
be
acute
or
ingenious
or
sagacious
when
we
please
though
we
may
become
more
so
by
practice
the
same
may
be
said
of
caution
so
far
as
caution
implies
taking
into
due
account
circumstances
unfavourable
to
our
wishes
and
aims
for
by
no
effort
of
will
can
we
certainly
see
what
circumstances
are
material
we
can
only
look
steadily
and
comprehensively
the
term
caution
however
may
also
be
legitimately
applied
to
a
species
of
which
we
shall
properly
regard
as
a
virtue
viz
the
tendency
to
deliberate
whenever
and
so
long
as
deliberation
is
judged
to
be
required
even
though
powerful
impulses
urge
us
to
immediate
action
and
in
antithesis
to
caution
we
may
notice
as
another
minor
virtue
the
quality
called
decision
so
far
as
we
mean
by
decision
the
habit
of
resisting
an
irrational
impulse
to
which
men
are
liable
of
continuing
to
some
extent
in
the
deliberative
attitude
when
they
know
that
deliberation
is
no
longer
expedient
and
that
they
ought
to
be
acting
decision
however
is
often
applied
like
caution
to
denote
solely
or
chiefly
a
merely
intellectual
excellence
viz
the
tendency
to
judge
rightly
as
to
the
time
for
closing
deliberation
i
conclude
then
that
so
far
as
such
qualities
as
those
which
i
have
distinguished
as
caution
and
decision
are
recognised
as
virtues
and
not
merely
as
intellectual
excellences
it
is
because
they
are
in
fact
species
of
because
they
involve
voluntary
adoption
of
and
adhesion
to
rational
judgments
as
to
conduct
in
spite
of
certain
irrational
motives
prompting
in
an
opposite
direction
now
it
may
seem
at
first
sight
that
if
we
suppose
perfect
correctness
of
judgment
combined
with
perfect
the
result
will
be
a
perfect
performance
of
duty
in
all
departments
and
the
realisation
of
perfect
virtue
except
so
far
as
this
involves
the
presence
of
certain
special
emotions
not
to
be
commanded
at
will
and
no
doubt
a
perfectly
wise
and
man
can
not
be
conceived
as
breaking
or
neglecting
any
moral
rule
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
even
sincere
and
efforts
to
realise
what
we
see
to
be
right
may
vary
in
intensity
and
that
therefore
the
tendency
to
manifest
a
high
degree
of
intensity
in
such
efforts
is
properly
praised
as
energy
if
the
quality
be
purely
volitional
or
under
some
such
name
as
zeal
or
moral
ardour
if
the
volitional
energy
be
referred
to
intensity
of
emotion
and
yet
not
connected
with
any
emotion
more
special
than
the
general
love
of
what
is
right
or
good
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
the
discussions
of
this
chapter
the
question
at
issue
between
intuitional
and
utilitarian
ethics
is
not
yet
reached
for
granting
that
we
can
elicit
by
reflection
clear
rules
of
duty
under
the
heads
of
wisdom
caution
and
decision
the
rules
are
obviously
not
independent
they
presuppose
an
intellectual
judgment
otherwise
obtained
or
capable
of
being
obtained
as
to
what
is
right
or
expedient
to
do
footnotes
indeed
aristotle
who
stood
alone
among
the
schools
sprung
from
socrates
in
distinguishing
sharply
theoretic
from
practical
wisdom
restricts
the
term
σοφία
to
the
former
and
uses
another
word
φρόνησις
to
denote
the
latter
i
have
already
adverted
to
the
difference
between
ancient
and
modern
thought
in
this
respect
cf
book
chap
note
it
may
be
observed
that
there
is
another
meaning
again
in
which
the
term
caution
is
sometimes
used
since
of
the
various
means
which
we
may
use
to
gain
any
end
some
are
more
and
some
less
certain
and
some
are
dangerous
that
is
involve
a
chance
of
consequences
either
antagonistic
to
our
pursuit
or
on
different
grounds
to
be
avoided
while
others
are
free
from
such
danger
caution
is
often
used
to
denote
the
temper
of
mind
which
inclines
to
the
more
certain
and
less
dangerous
means
in
this
sense
in
so
far
as
the
chance
in
each
case
of
winning
the
end
and
the
value
of
the
end
as
compared
with
other
ends
and
as
weighed
against
the
detriment
which
its
pursuit
may
entail
can
be
precisely
estimated
the
limits
of
the
duty
of
caution
may
obviously
be
determined
without
difficulty
see
and
of
the
next
chapter
chapter
iv
benevolence
we
have
seen
that
the
virtue
of
practical
wisdom
comprehends
all
others
so
far
as
virtuous
conduct
in
each
department
necessarily
results
from
a
clear
knowledge
and
choice
of
the
true
ultimate
end
or
ends
of
action
and
of
the
best
means
to
the
attainment
of
such
end
or
ends
from
this
point
of
view
we
may
consider
the
names
of
the
special
virtues
as
denoting
special
departments
of
this
knowledge
which
it
is
now
our
business
to
examine
more
closely
when
however
we
contemplate
these
we
discern
that
there
are
other
virtues
which
in
different
ways
may
be
regarded
as
no
less
comprehensive
than
wisdom
especially
in
modern
times
since
the
revival
of
independent
ethical
speculation
there
have
always
been
thinkers
who
have
maintained
in
some
form
the
view
that
benevolence
is
a
supreme
and
architectonic
virtue
comprehending
and
summing
up
all
the
others
and
fitted
to
regulate
them
and
determine
their
proper
limits
and
mutual
relations
this
widely
supported
claim
to
supremacy
seems
an
adequate
reason
for
giving
to
benevolence
the
first
place
after
wisdom
in
our
examination
of
the
commonly
received
maxims
of
duty
and
virtue
the
general
maxim
of
benevolence
would
be
commonly
said
to
be
that
we
ought
to
love
all
our
or
all
our
but
as
we
have
already
seen
there
is
some
doubt
among
moralists
as
to
the
precise
meaning
of
the
term
love
in
this
connexion
since
according
to
kant
and
others
what
is
morally
prescribed
as
the
duty
of
benevolence
is
not
strictly
the
affection
of
love
or
kindness
so
far
as
this
contains
an
emotional
element
but
only
the
determination
of
the
will
to
seek
the
good
or
happiness
of
others
and
i
agree
that
it
can
not
be
a
strict
duty
to
feel
an
emotion
so
far
as
it
is
not
directly
within
the
power
of
the
will
to
produce
it
at
any
given
time
still
as
i
have
said
it
seems
to
me
that
this
emotional
element
is
included
in
our
common
notion
of
charity
or
philanthropy
regarded
as
a
virtue
and
i
think
it
paradoxical
to
deny
that
it
raises
the
mere
beneficent
disposition
of
the
will
to
a
higher
degree
of
excellence
and
renders
its
effects
better
if
this
be
so
it
will
be
a
duty
to
cultivate
the
affection
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so
and
indeed
this
would
seem
no
less
than
the
permanent
disposition
to
do
good
to
be
a
normal
effect
of
repeated
beneficent
resolves
and
actions
since
as
has
often
been
observed
a
benefit
tends
to
excite
love
in
the
agent
towards
the
recipient
of
the
benefit
no
less
than
in
the
recipient
towards
the
agent
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
this
effect
is
less
certain
than
the
production
of
the
benevolent
disposition
and
that
some
men
are
naturally
so
unattractive
to
others
that
the
latter
can
feel
no
affection
though
they
may
entertain
benevolent
dispositions
towards
the
former
at
any
rate
it
would
seem
to
be
a
duty
generally
and
till
we
find
the
effort
fruitless
to
cultivate
kind
affections
towards
those
whom
we
ought
to
benefit
not
only
by
doing
kind
actions
but
by
placing
ourselves
under
any
natural
influences
which
experience
shows
to
have
a
tendency
to
produce
affection
but
we
have
still
to
ascertain
more
particularly
the
nature
of
the
actions
in
which
this
affection
or
disposition
of
will
is
shown
they
are
described
popularly
as
doing
now
we
have
before
noticed
that
the
notion
good
in
ordinary
thought
includes
undistinguished
and
therefore
unharmonised
the
different
conceptions
that
men
form
of
the
ultimate
end
of
rational
action
it
follows
that
there
is
a
corresponding
ambiguity
in
the
phrase
doing
good
since
though
many
would
unhesitatingly
take
it
to
mean
the
promotion
of
happiness
there
are
others
who
holding
that
perfection
and
not
happiness
is
the
true
ultimate
good
consistently
maintain
that
the
real
way
to
do
good
to
people
is
to
increase
their
virtue
or
aid
their
progress
towards
perfection
there
are
however
even
among
moralists
some
such
as
kant
who
take
an
opposite
view
and
argue
that
my
neighbour
s
virtue
or
perfection
can
not
be
an
end
to
me
because
it
depends
upon
the
free
exercise
of
his
own
volition
which
i
can
not
help
or
hinder
but
on
the
same
grounds
it
might
equally
well
be
argued
that
i
can
not
virtue
in
myself
but
only
practise
it
from
moment
to
moment
whereas
even
kant
does
not
deny
that
we
can
cultivate
virtuous
dispositions
in
ourselves
and
that
in
other
ways
than
by
the
performance
of
virtuous
acts
and
common
sense
always
assumes
this
to
be
possible
and
prescribes
it
as
a
duty
and
surely
it
is
equally
undeniable
that
we
can
cultivate
virtue
in
others
and
indeed
such
cultivation
is
clearly
the
object
not
only
of
education
but
of
a
large
part
of
social
action
especially
of
our
expression
of
praise
and
blame
and
if
virtue
is
an
ultimate
end
for
ourselves
to
be
sought
for
its
own
sake
benevolence
must
lead
us
to
do
what
is
possible
to
obtain
it
for
our
neighbour
and
indeed
we
see
that
in
the
case
of
intense
individual
affection
the
friend
or
lover
generally
longs
that
the
beloved
should
be
excellent
and
admirable
as
well
as
happy
perhaps
however
this
is
because
love
involves
preference
and
the
lover
desires
that
the
beloved
should
be
really
worthy
of
preference
as
well
as
actually
preferred
by
him
as
otherwise
there
is
a
conflict
between
love
and
reason
on
the
whole
then
i
do
not
find
in
the
common
view
of
what
benevolence
bids
us
promote
for
others
any
clear
selection
indicated
between
the
different
and
possibly
conflicting
elements
of
good
as
commonly
conceived
but
we
may
say
i
think
that
the
promotion
of
happiness
is
practically
the
chief
part
of
what
common
sense
considers
to
be
prescribed
as
the
external
duty
of
benevolence
and
for
clearness
sake
we
will
confine
our
attention
to
this
in
the
remainder
of
the
discussion
it
should
be
observed
that
by
happiness
we
are
not
to
understand
simply
the
gratification
of
the
actual
desires
of
others
for
men
too
often
desire
what
would
tend
to
their
unhappiness
in
the
long
run
but
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
for
them
on
the
whole
in
short
such
happiness
as
was
taken
to
be
the
rational
end
for
each
individual
in
the
system
of
egoistic
hedonism
it
is
this
that
rational
benevolence
bids
us
provide
for
others
and
if
one
who
loves
is
led
from
affectionate
sympathy
with
the
longings
of
the
beloved
to
gratify
those
longings
believing
that
the
gratification
will
be
attended
with
an
overplus
of
painful
consequences
we
commonly
say
that
such
affection
is
weak
and
foolish
it
remains
to
ask
towards
whom
this
disposition
or
affection
is
to
be
maintained
and
to
what
extent
and
firstly
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
we
owe
benevolence
to
men
alone
or
to
other
animals
also
that
is
there
is
a
general
agreement
that
we
ought
to
treat
all
animals
with
kindness
so
far
as
to
avoid
causing
them
unnecessary
pain
but
it
is
questioned
whether
this
is
directly
due
to
sentient
beings
as
such
or
merely
prescribed
as
a
means
of
cultivating
kindly
dispositions
towards
men
intuitional
moralists
of
repute
have
maintained
this
latter
view
i
think
however
that
common
sense
is
disposed
to
regard
this
as
a
paradox
and
to
hold
with
bentham
that
the
pain
of
animals
is
to
be
avoided
passing
to
consider
how
our
benevolence
ought
to
be
distributed
among
our
we
may
conveniently
make
clear
the
intuitional
view
by
contrasting
it
with
that
of
utilitarianism
for
utilitarianism
is
sometimes
said
to
resolve
all
virtue
into
universal
and
impartial
benevolence
it
does
not
however
prescribe
that
we
should
love
all
men
equally
but
that
we
should
aim
at
happiness
generally
as
our
ultimate
end
and
so
consider
the
happiness
of
any
one
individual
as
equally
important
with
the
equal
happiness
of
any
other
as
an
element
of
this
total
and
should
distribute
our
kindness
so
as
to
make
this
total
as
great
as
possible
in
whatever
way
this
result
may
be
attained
practically
of
course
the
distribution
of
any
individual
s
services
will
even
on
this
view
be
unequal
as
each
man
will
obviously
promote
the
general
happiness
best
by
rendering
services
to
a
limited
number
and
to
some
more
than
others
but
the
inequality
on
the
utilitarian
theory
is
secondary
and
derivative
common
sense
however
seems
rather
to
regard
it
as
immediately
certain
without
any
such
deduction
that
we
owe
special
dues
of
kindness
to
those
who
stand
in
special
relations
to
us
the
question
then
is
on
what
principles
when
any
case
of
doubt
or
apparent
conflict
of
duties
arises
we
are
to
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
special
claims
to
affection
and
kind
services
which
arise
out
of
these
particular
relations
of
human
beings
are
problems
of
this
kind
to
be
solved
by
considering
which
course
of
conduct
is
on
the
whole
most
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
or
can
we
find
independent
and
principles
sufficiently
clear
and
precise
to
furnish
practical
guidance
in
such
cases
the
different
answers
given
to
this
fundamental
question
will
obviously
constitute
the
main
difference
between
the
intuitional
and
utilitarian
methods
so
far
as
the
good
which
the
benevolent
man
desires
and
seeks
to
confer
on
others
is
understood
to
be
happiness
when
however
we
come
to
investigate
this
question
we
are
met
with
a
difficulty
in
the
arrangement
of
the
subject
which
like
most
difficulties
of
classification
deserves
attentive
consideration
as
it
depends
upon
important
characteristics
of
the
matter
that
has
to
be
arranged
in
a
narrower
sense
of
the
term
benevolence
is
not
unfrequently
distinguished
from
and
even
contrasted
with
justice
we
may
of
course
exercise
both
towards
the
same
persons
but
we
commonly
assume
that
the
special
function
of
benevolence
begins
where
justice
ends
and
it
is
rather
with
this
special
function
that
we
are
concerned
in
considering
claims
to
affection
and
to
kind
services
normally
prompted
by
affection
at
the
same
time
if
we
consider
these
services
as
strictly
due
to
persons
in
certain
relations
the
moral
notion
under
which
these
duties
are
presented
to
us
is
not
easily
distinguishable
from
that
of
justice
while
yet
these
duties
can
hardly
be
withdrawn
from
the
sphere
of
benevolence
in
the
narrowest
sense
it
is
sometimes
given
as
a
distinction
between
justice
and
benevolence
that
the
services
which
justice
prescribes
can
be
claimed
as
a
right
by
their
recipient
while
benevolence
is
essentially
unconstrained
but
we
certainly
think
that
parents
have
a
right
to
filial
affection
and
to
the
services
that
naturally
spring
from
it
it
is
further
said
that
the
duties
of
affection
are
essentially
indefinite
while
those
we
classify
under
the
head
of
justice
are
precisely
defined
and
no
doubt
this
is
partly
true
we
not
only
find
it
hard
to
say
exactly
how
much
a
son
owes
his
parents
but
we
are
even
reluctant
to
investigate
this
we
do
not
think
that
he
ought
to
ask
for
a
precise
measure
of
his
duty
in
order
that
he
may
do
just
so
much
and
no
more
while
a
great
part
of
justice
consists
in
the
observance
of
stated
agreements
and
precise
rules
at
the
same
time
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
this
distinction
as
a
ground
of
classification
for
the
duties
of
affection
are
admittedly
liable
to
come
into
competition
with
each
other
and
with
other
duties
and
when
this
apparent
conflict
of
duties
occurs
we
manifestly
need
as
precise
a
definition
as
possible
of
the
conflicting
obligations
in
order
to
make
a
reasonable
choice
among
the
alternatives
of
conduct
presented
to
us
accordingly
in
the
following
chapter
i
shall
show
how
this
competition
of
claims
renders
our
common
notion
of
justice
applicable
to
these
no
less
than
to
other
duties
meanwhile
it
seems
proper
to
treat
here
separately
of
all
duties
that
arise
out
of
relations
where
affection
normally
exists
and
where
it
ought
to
be
cultivated
and
where
its
absence
is
deplored
if
not
blamed
for
all
are
agreed
that
there
are
such
duties
the
of
which
is
a
ground
for
censure
beyond
the
obligations
imposed
by
law
or
arising
out
of
specific
contract
which
will
come
under
a
different
head
beyond
these
duties
again
there
seems
to
be
a
region
of
performance
where
the
services
rendered
can
not
properly
be
claimed
as
of
debt
and
blame
is
not
felt
to
be
due
for
and
with
regard
to
this
region
too
which
clearly
belongs
to
benevolence
as
contrasted
with
justice
there
is
some
difficulty
in
stating
the
view
of
common
sense
morality
there
are
two
questions
to
be
considered
we
have
to
ask
firstly
whether
services
rendered
from
affection
over
and
above
what
strict
duty
is
thought
to
require
are
to
be
deemed
virtuous
and
secondly
whether
the
affection
itself
is
to
be
considered
worthy
of
admiration
as
a
moral
excellence
and
therefore
a
mental
condition
that
we
should
strive
to
attain
i
think
that
common
sense
clearly
regards
as
virtuous
the
disposition
to
render
substantial
positive
services
to
men
at
large
and
promote
their
whether
such
a
disposition
springs
out
of
natural
kindliness
of
feeling
towards
human
beings
generally
or
whether
it
is
merely
the
result
of
moral
effort
and
resolve
provided
it
is
accompanied
by
an
adequate
degree
of
intellectual
enlightenment
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
less
comprehensive
affection
that
impels
men
to
promote
the
of
the
community
of
which
they
are
members
and
again
of
the
affection
that
normally
tends
to
accompany
the
recognition
of
rightful
rule
or
leadership
in
others
in
some
ages
and
countries
patriotism
and
loyalty
have
been
regarded
as
almost
supreme
among
the
virtues
and
even
now
common
sense
gives
them
a
high
place
but
when
we
pass
to
more
restricted
and
ordinarily
more
intense
affections
such
as
those
which
we
feel
for
relations
and
friends
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
determine
whether
they
are
to
be
considered
as
moral
excellences
and
cultivated
as
such
first
to
avoid
confusion
we
must
remark
that
love
is
not
merely
a
desire
to
do
good
to
the
object
beloved
although
it
always
involves
such
a
desire
it
is
primarily
a
pleasurable
emotion
which
seems
to
depend
upon
a
certain
sense
of
union
with
another
person
and
it
includes
besides
the
benevolent
impulse
a
desire
of
the
society
of
the
beloved
and
this
element
may
predominate
over
the
former
and
even
conflict
with
it
so
that
the
true
interests
of
the
beloved
may
be
sacrificed
in
this
case
we
call
the
affection
selfish
and
do
not
praise
it
at
all
but
rather
blame
if
now
we
ask
whether
intense
love
for
an
individual
considered
merely
as
a
benevolent
impulse
is
in
itself
a
moral
excellence
it
is
difficult
to
extract
a
very
definite
answer
from
common
sense
but
i
think
it
inclines
on
the
whole
to
the
negative
we
are
no
doubt
generally
inclined
to
admire
any
kind
of
conspicuously
altruistic
conduct
and
any
form
of
intense
love
however
restricted
in
its
scope
yet
it
hardly
seems
that
the
susceptibility
to
such
individualised
benevolent
emotions
is
exactly
regarded
as
an
essential
element
of
moral
perfection
which
we
ought
to
strive
after
and
cultivate
like
other
moral
excellences
we
seem
in
fact
to
doubt
whether
such
effort
is
desirable
in
this
case
at
least
beyond
the
point
up
to
which
such
affection
is
thought
to
be
required
for
the
performance
of
recognised
duties
again
we
think
it
natural
and
desirable
that
as
generally
speaking
each
person
feels
strong
affection
for
only
a
few
individuals
in
his
efforts
to
promote
directly
the
of
others
he
should
to
a
great
extent
follow
the
promptings
of
such
restricted
affection
but
we
are
hardly
prepared
to
recommend
that
he
should
render
services
to
special
individuals
beyond
what
he
is
bound
to
render
and
such
as
are
the
natural
expression
of
an
eager
and
overflowing
affection
without
having
any
such
affection
to
express
although
as
was
before
said
in
certain
intimate
relations
we
do
not
approve
of
the
limits
of
duty
being
too
exactly
measured
on
the
whole
then
i
conclude
that
while
we
praise
and
admire
enthusiastic
benevolence
and
patriotism
and
are
touched
and
charmed
by
the
spontaneous
lavish
outflow
of
gratitude
friendship
and
the
domestic
affections
still
what
chiefly
concerns
us
as
moralists
under
the
present
head
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
right
rules
of
distribution
of
services
and
kind
acts
in
so
far
as
we
consider
the
rendering
of
these
to
be
morally
obligatory
for
provided
a
man
fulfils
these
duties
and
observes
the
other
recognised
rules
of
morality
common
sense
is
not
prepared
to
say
how
far
it
is
right
or
good
that
he
should
sacrifice
any
other
noble
and
worthy
aim
such
as
the
cultivation
of
knowledge
or
any
of
the
fine
arts
to
the
claims
of
philanthropy
or
personal
affection
there
seem
to
be
no
generally
accepted
intuitional
principles
for
determining
such
a
choice
of
alternatives
what
then
are
the
duties
that
we
owe
to
our
so
far
as
they
do
not
seem
to
come
under
the
head
of
justice
more
properly
than
benevolence
perhaps
the
mere
enumeration
of
them
is
not
difficult
we
should
all
agree
that
each
of
us
is
bound
to
show
kindness
to
his
parents
and
spouse
and
children
and
to
other
kinsmen
in
a
less
degree
and
to
those
who
have
rendered
services
to
him
and
any
others
whom
he
may
have
admitted
to
his
intimacy
and
called
friends
and
to
neighbours
and
to
more
than
others
and
perhaps
we
may
say
to
those
of
our
own
race
more
than
to
black
or
yellow
men
and
generally
to
human
beings
in
proportion
to
their
affinity
to
ourselves
and
to
our
country
as
a
corporate
whole
we
believe
ourselves
to
owe
the
greatest
sacrifices
when
occasion
calls
but
in
a
lower
stage
of
civilisation
this
debt
is
thought
to
be
due
rather
to
one
s
king
or
chief
and
a
similar
obligation
seems
to
be
recognised
though
less
definitely
and
in
a
less
degree
as
regards
minor
corporations
of
which
we
are
members
and
to
all
men
with
whom
we
may
be
brought
into
relation
we
are
held
to
owe
slight
services
and
such
as
may
be
rendered
without
inconvenience
but
those
who
are
in
distress
or
urgent
need
have
a
claim
on
us
for
special
kindness
these
are
generally
recognised
claims
but
we
find
considerable
difficulty
and
divergence
when
we
attempt
to
determine
more
precisely
their
extent
and
relative
obligation
and
the
divergence
becomes
indefinitely
greater
when
we
compare
the
customs
and
common
opinions
now
existing
among
ourselves
in
respect
of
such
claims
with
those
of
other
ages
and
countries
for
example
in
earlier
ages
of
society
a
peculiar
sacredness
was
attached
to
the
tie
of
hospitality
and
claims
arising
out
of
it
were
considered
peculiarly
stringent
but
this
has
changed
as
hospitality
in
the
progress
of
civilisation
has
become
a
luxury
rather
than
a
necessary
and
we
do
not
think
that
we
owe
much
to
a
man
because
we
have
asked
him
to
dinner
or
again
we
may
take
an
instance
where
the
alteration
is
perhaps
actually
going
on
the
claims
of
kindred
in
respect
of
bequest
we
should
now
commonly
think
that
a
man
ought
usually
to
leave
his
property
to
his
children
but
that
if
he
has
no
children
we
think
he
may
do
what
he
likes
with
it
unless
any
of
his
brothers
or
sisters
are
in
poverty
in
which
case
compassion
seems
to
blend
with
and
invigorate
the
evanescent
claim
of
consanguinity
but
in
an
age
not
long
past
a
childless
man
was
held
to
be
morally
bound
to
leave
his
money
to
his
collateral
relatives
and
thus
we
are
naturally
led
to
conjecture
that
in
the
not
distant
future
any
similar
obligation
to
children
unless
they
are
in
want
or
unless
their
education
is
not
completed
may
have
vanished
out
of
men
s
minds
a
similar
change
might
be
traced
in
the
commonly
recognised
duty
of
children
to
parents
it
may
however
be
urged
that
this
variation
of
custom
is
no
obstacle
to
the
definition
of
duty
because
we
may
lay
down
that
the
customs
of
any
society
ought
to
be
obeyed
so
long
as
they
are
established
just
as
the
laws
ought
although
both
customs
and
laws
may
be
changed
from
time
to
time
and
no
doubt
it
is
generally
expedient
to
conform
to
established
customs
still
on
reflection
we
see
that
it
can
not
be
laid
down
as
an
absolute
duty
for
the
cases
of
custom
and
law
are
not
similar
as
in
every
progressive
community
there
is
a
regular
and
settled
mode
of
abrogating
laws
that
are
found
bad
but
customs
can
not
be
thus
formally
abolished
and
we
only
get
rid
of
them
through
the
refusal
of
private
individuals
to
obey
them
and
therefore
it
must
be
sometimes
right
to
do
this
if
some
customs
are
vexatious
and
pernicious
as
we
frequently
judge
those
of
antique
and
alien
communities
to
be
and
if
we
say
that
customs
should
generally
be
obeyed
but
that
they
may
be
disobeyed
when
they
reach
a
certain
degree
of
inexpediency
our
method
seems
to
resolve
itself
into
utilitarianism
for
we
can
not
reasonably
rest
the
general
obligation
upon
one
principle
and
determine
its
limits
and
exceptions
by
another
if
the
duties
above
enumerated
can
be
referred
to
independent
and
principles
the
limits
of
each
must
be
implicitly
given
in
the
intuition
that
reveals
the
principle
in
order
then
to
ascertain
how
far
we
possess
such
principles
let
us
examine
in
more
detail
what
common
sense
seems
to
affirm
in
respect
of
these
duties
they
seem
to
range
themselves
under
four
heads
there
are
duties
arising
out
of
comparatively
permanent
relationships
not
voluntarily
chosen
such
as
kindred
and
in
most
cases
citizenship
and
neighbourhood
those
of
similar
relationships
voluntarily
contracted
such
as
friendship
those
that
spring
from
special
services
received
or
duties
of
gratitude
and
those
that
seem
due
to
special
need
or
duties
of
pity
this
classification
is
i
think
convenient
for
discussion
but
i
can
not
profess
that
it
clearly
and
completely
avoids
cross
divisions
since
for
example
the
principle
of
gratitude
is
often
appealed
to
as
supplying
the
for
the
duties
owed
by
children
to
parents
here
however
we
come
upon
a
material
disagreement
and
difficulty
in
determining
the
maxim
of
this
species
of
duty
it
would
be
agreed
that
children
owe
to
their
parents
respect
and
kindness
generally
and
assistance
in
case
of
infirmity
or
any
special
need
but
it
seems
doubtful
how
far
this
is
held
by
common
sense
to
be
due
on
account
of
the
relationship
alone
or
on
account
of
services
rendered
during
infancy
and
how
far
it
is
due
to
cruel
or
neglectful
parents
most
perhaps
would
say
here
and
in
other
cases
that
mere
nearness
of
blood
constituted
a
certain
claim
but
they
would
find
it
hard
to
agree
upon
its
exact
force
but
apart
from
this
there
seems
great
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
is
due
from
children
to
parents
who
have
performed
their
duty
as
for
example
how
far
obedience
is
due
from
a
child
who
is
no
longer
in
its
parents
guardianship
or
dependent
on
them
for
support
whether
a
son
or
a
daughter
is
bound
not
to
oppose
a
parent
s
wishes
in
marrying
or
choosing
a
profession
practically
we
find
that
parental
control
is
greater
in
the
case
of
persons
who
can
enrich
their
children
by
testament
still
we
can
hardly
take
this
into
consideration
in
determining
the
ideal
of
filial
duty
for
to
this
whatever
it
may
be
the
child
is
thought
to
be
absolutely
bound
and
not
as
a
in
anticipation
of
future
benefits
and
many
would
hold
that
a
parent
had
no
moral
right
to
disinherit
a
child
except
as
a
penalty
for
a
transgression
of
duty
and
this
leads
to
what
we
may
conveniently
examine
next
the
duty
of
parents
to
children
this
too
we
might
partly
classify
under
a
different
head
viz
that
of
duties
arising
out
of
special
needs
for
no
doubt
children
are
naturally
objects
of
compassion
on
account
of
their
helplessness
to
others
besides
their
parents
but
on
the
latter
they
have
a
claim
of
a
different
kind
springing
from
the
universally
recognised
duty
of
not
causing
pain
or
any
harm
to
other
human
beings
directly
or
indirectly
except
in
the
way
of
deserved
punishment
for
the
parent
being
the
cause
of
the
child
s
existing
in
a
helpless
condition
would
be
indirectly
the
cause
of
the
suffering
and
death
that
would
result
to
it
if
neglected
still
this
does
not
seem
an
adequate
explanation
of
parental
duty
as
recognised
by
common
sense
for
we
commonly
blame
a
parent
who
leaves
his
children
entirely
to
the
care
of
others
even
if
he
makes
ample
provision
for
their
being
nourished
and
trained
up
to
the
time
at
which
they
can
support
themselves
by
their
own
labour
we
think
that
he
owes
them
affection
as
far
as
this
can
be
said
to
be
a
duty
and
the
tender
and
watchful
care
that
naturally
springs
from
affection
and
if
he
can
afford
it
somewhat
more
than
the
necessary
minimum
of
food
clothing
and
education
still
it
does
not
seem
clear
how
far
beyond
this
he
is
bound
to
go
it
is
easy
to
say
broadly
that
he
ought
to
promote
his
children
s
happiness
by
all
means
in
his
power
and
no
doubt
it
is
natural
for
a
good
parent
to
find
his
own
best
happiness
in
his
children
s
and
we
are
disposed
to
blame
any
one
who
markedly
prefers
his
own
interest
to
theirs
still
it
seems
unreasonable
that
he
should
purchase
a
small
increase
of
their
happiness
by
a
great
sacrifice
of
his
own
and
moreover
there
are
other
worthy
and
noble
ends
which
may
and
do
come
into
competition
with
this
to
take
instances
of
actual
occurrence
one
parent
is
led
to
give
up
some
important
and
valuable
work
which
perhaps
no
one
else
can
or
will
do
in
order
to
leave
his
children
a
little
more
wealth
another
brings
them
to
the
verge
of
starvation
in
order
to
perfect
an
invention
or
prosecute
scientific
researches
we
seem
to
condemn
either
extreme
yet
what
clear
and
accepted
principle
can
be
stated
for
determining
the
true
mean
again
as
we
have
seen
some
think
that
a
parent
has
no
right
to
bequeath
his
inheritance
away
from
his
children
unless
they
have
been
undutiful
and
in
some
states
this
is
even
forbidden
by
law
others
however
hold
that
children
as
such
have
no
claims
to
their
parents
wealth
but
only
if
there
is
a
tacit
understanding
that
they
will
succeed
to
it
or
at
any
rate
if
they
have
been
reared
in
such
habits
of
life
and
social
relations
as
will
render
it
difficult
and
painful
for
them
to
live
without
inherited
wealth
it
would
be
tedious
to
go
in
detail
through
all
the
degrees
of
consanguinity
as
it
is
clear
that
our
conception
of
the
mutual
duties
of
kinsmen
becomes
vaguer
as
the
kinship
becomes
more
remote
among
children
of
the
same
parents
brought
up
together
affection
of
more
or
less
strength
grows
up
so
naturally
and
commonly
that
we
regard
those
who
feel
no
affection
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
certain
aversion
and
moral
contempt
as
somewhat
inhuman
and
we
think
that
in
any
case
the
services
and
kind
acts
which
naturally
spring
from
affection
ought
to
be
rendered
to
some
extent
but
the
extent
seems
quite
undefined
and
even
towards
remoter
kinsmen
we
think
that
a
certain
flow
of
kindly
feeling
will
attend
the
representation
of
consanguinity
in
men
of
good
dispositions
some
indeed
still
think
that
cousins
have
a
moral
right
to
a
man
s
inheritance
in
default
of
nearer
heirs
and
to
assistance
in
any
need
but
it
seems
equally
common
to
hold
that
they
can
at
most
claim
to
be
selected
as
the
recipients
of
bounty
and
that
an
unpromising
cousin
should
not
be
preferred
to
a
promising
stranger
i
have
placed
neighbourhood
along
with
kindred
among
the
relations
out
of
which
a
certain
claim
for
mutual
services
is
thought
to
spring
however
no
one
perhaps
would
say
that
mere
local
juxtaposition
is
in
itself
a
ground
of
duties
it
seems
rather
that
neighbours
naturally
feel
more
sympathy
with
one
another
than
with
strangers
as
the
tie
of
common
humanity
is
strengthened
even
by
such
conjunction
and
mutual
association
as
mere
neighbourhood
without
or
friendship
may
involve
and
a
man
in
whom
this
effect
is
not
produced
is
thought
more
or
less
inhuman
and
so
in
large
towns
where
this
mutual
sympathy
does
not
so
naturally
grow
up
for
all
the
townsmen
are
in
a
sense
neighbours
and
one
can
not
easily
sympathise
with
each
individual
in
a
multitude
the
tie
of
neighbourhood
is
felt
to
be
relaxed
and
neighbour
only
claims
from
neighbour
as
the
nearest
man
what
one
man
may
claim
from
another
for
there
are
some
services
slight
in
ordinary
times
but
greater
in
the
case
of
exceptional
need
which
any
man
is
thought
to
have
a
right
to
ask
from
any
other
so
that
a
comparatively
trifling
circumstance
may
easily
give
a
special
direction
to
this
general
claim
and
make
it
seem
reasonable
that
the
service
should
be
asked
from
one
person
rather
than
another
thus
any
degree
of
kinship
seems
to
have
this
effect
since
the
representation
of
this
tends
to
produce
a
feeling
of
union
and
consequent
sympathy
and
so
even
the
fact
of
belonging
to
the
same
province
as
creating
a
slight
probability
of
community
of
origin
and
again
similarities
of
various
kinds
as
one
sympathises
more
easily
with
one
s
like
and
so
persons
naturally
seek
aid
in
distress
from
those
of
the
same
age
or
sex
or
rank
or
profession
the
duty
of
neighbourhood
seems
therefore
only
a
particular
application
of
the
duty
of
general
benevolence
or
humanity
and
the
claim
of
is
of
the
same
kind
that
is
if
they
are
taken
as
individuals
for
one
s
relation
to
one
s
country
as
a
whole
is
thought
to
be
of
a
different
kind
and
to
involve
much
more
stringent
obligations
still
the
duties
of
patriotism
are
difficult
to
formulate
for
the
mere
obedience
to
the
laws
of
a
country
which
morality
requires
from
all
its
inhabitants
seems
to
come
under
another
head
and
aliens
are
equally
bound
to
this
and
in
the
case
of
most
social
functions
which
men
undertake
patriotism
is
at
least
not
a
prominent
nor
indispensable
motive
for
they
undertake
them
primarily
for
the
sake
of
payment
and
having
undertaken
them
are
bound
by
justice
and
good
faith
to
perform
them
adequately
however
if
any
of
the
functions
of
government
are
unpaid
we
consider
that
men
exhibit
patriotism
in
performing
them
for
though
it
is
plausible
to
say
that
they
get
their
payment
in
social
distinction
still
on
reflection
this
view
does
not
appear
to
be
quite
appropriate
since
social
distinction
is
intended
to
express
feelings
of
honour
and
respect
and
we
can
not
properly
render
these
as
part
of
a
bargain
but
only
as
a
tribute
paid
to
virtue
or
excellence
of
some
kind
but
how
far
any
individual
is
bound
to
undertake
such
functions
is
not
quite
clear
and
the
question
seems
generally
decided
by
considerations
of
expediency
except
in
so
far
as
duties
of
this
kind
devolve
legally
or
constitutionally
upon
all
the
citizens
in
a
free
country
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
to
some
extent
among
these
the
duty
of
fighting
the
national
enemies
is
prominent
in
many
countries
and
even
where
this
function
has
become
a
salaried
and
voluntarily
adopted
profession
it
is
often
felt
to
be
in
a
special
sense
the
service
of
one
s
country
and
we
think
it
at
least
desirable
and
best
that
it
should
be
performed
with
feelings
of
patriotism
as
we
find
it
somewhat
degrading
and
repulsive
that
a
man
should
slaughter
his
for
hire
and
in
great
crises
of
national
existence
the
affection
of
patriotism
is
naturally
intensified
and
even
in
ordinary
times
we
praise
a
man
who
renders
services
to
his
country
over
and
above
the
common
duties
of
citizenship
but
whether
a
citizen
is
at
any
time
morally
bound
to
more
than
certain
legally
or
constitutionally
determined
duties
does
not
seem
to
be
clear
nor
again
is
there
general
agreement
on
the
question
whether
by
voluntary
expatriation
he
can
rightfully
relieve
himself
of
all
moral
obligations
to
the
community
in
which
he
was
born
nor
finally
does
there
seem
to
be
any
as
to
what
each
man
owes
to
his
as
such
the
utilitarian
doctrine
as
we
have
seen
is
that
each
man
ought
to
consider
the
happiness
of
any
other
as
of
equal
importance
with
his
own
and
only
of
less
importance
in
so
far
as
he
is
better
able
to
realise
the
latter
and
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
say
decidedly
that
this
is
the
principle
of
general
benevolence
as
recognised
by
the
common
sense
of
mankind
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
also
current
a
lower
and
narrower
estimate
of
the
services
that
we
are
held
to
be
strictly
bound
to
render
to
our
generally
this
lower
view
seems
to
recognise
as
was
before
noticed
a
negative
duty
to
abstain
from
causing
pain
or
harm
to
any
of
our
except
in
the
way
of
deserved
punishment
to
which
we
may
add
as
an
immediate
corollary
the
duty
of
making
reparation
for
any
harm
that
we
may
have
done
them
and
a
positive
duty
to
render
when
occasion
offers
such
services
as
require
either
no
sacrifice
on
our
part
or
at
least
one
very
much
less
in
importance
than
the
service
rendered
further
a
general
obligation
of
being
useful
to
society
by
some
kind
of
systematic
work
is
vaguely
recognised
rich
persons
who
are
manifest
drones
incur
some
degree
of
censure
from
the
majority
of
thoughtful
persons
beyond
this
somewhat
indefinite
limit
of
duty
extends
the
virtue
of
benevolence
without
limit
for
excess
is
not
thought
to
be
possible
in
doing
good
to
others
nor
in
the
disposition
to
do
it
unless
it
leads
us
to
neglect
definite
duties
under
the
notion
of
benevolence
as
just
defined
the
minor
rules
of
gentleness
politeness
courtesy
etc
may
be
brought
in
so
far
as
they
prescribe
the
expression
of
general
goodwill
and
abstinence
from
anything
that
may
cause
pain
to
others
in
conversation
and
social
demeanour
there
is
however
an
important
part
of
politeness
which
it
may
be
well
to
notice
and
discuss
separately
the
duty
namely
of
showing
marks
of
reverence
to
those
to
whom
they
are
properly
due
reverence
we
may
define
as
the
feeling
which
accompanies
the
recognition
of
superiority
or
worth
in
others
it
does
not
seem
to
be
necessarily
in
itself
benevolent
though
often
accompanied
by
some
degree
of
love
but
its
ethical
characteristics
seem
analogous
to
those
of
benevolent
affection
in
so
far
as
while
it
is
not
a
feeling
directly
under
the
control
of
the
will
we
yet
expect
it
under
certain
circumstances
and
morally
dislike
its
absence
and
perhaps
commonly
consider
the
expression
of
it
to
be
sometimes
a
duty
even
when
the
feeling
itself
is
absent
still
as
to
this
latter
duty
of
expressing
reverence
there
seems
to
be
great
divergence
of
opinion
for
the
feeling
seems
to
be
naturally
excited
by
all
kinds
of
superiority
not
merely
moral
and
intellectual
excellences
but
also
superiorities
of
rank
and
position
and
indeed
in
the
common
behaviour
of
men
it
is
to
the
latter
that
it
is
more
regularly
and
formally
rendered
and
yet
again
it
is
commonly
said
that
reverence
is
more
properly
due
to
the
former
as
being
more
real
and
intrinsic
superiorities
and
many
think
that
to
show
any
reverence
to
men
of
rank
and
position
rather
than
to
others
is
servile
and
degrading
and
some
even
dislike
the
marks
of
respect
which
in
most
countries
are
exacted
by
official
superiors
from
their
subordinates
saying
that
obedience
legally
defined
is
all
that
is
properly
owed
in
this
relation
a
more
serious
difficulty
of
a
somewhat
similar
kind
arises
when
we
consider
how
far
it
is
a
duty
to
cultivate
the
affection
of
loyalty
meaning
by
this
term
which
is
used
in
various
senses
the
affection
that
is
normally
felt
by
a
servant
or
official
subordinate
towards
a
good
master
or
official
superior
on
the
one
hand
it
is
widely
thought
that
the
duties
of
obedience
which
belong
to
these
relations
will
be
better
performed
if
affection
enters
into
the
motive
no
less
than
the
duties
of
the
family
relations
but
in
the
former
case
it
seems
to
be
a
tenable
view
that
the
habits
of
orderliness
and
good
faith
ungrudging
obedience
to
law
and
ungrudging
fulfilment
of
contract
will
ordinarily
suffice
without
personal
affection
and
on
the
other
hand
a
disposition
to
obey
superiors
beyond
the
limits
of
their
legal
or
contractual
rights
to
issue
commands
may
easily
be
mischievous
in
its
effects
if
the
superiors
are
in
the
case
of
a
wise
and
good
superior
it
is
indeed
clearly
advantageous
that
inferiors
should
be
disposed
to
obey
beyond
these
limits
but
it
is
not
therefore
clear
that
this
disposition
is
one
which
it
should
be
made
a
duty
to
cultivate
beyond
the
degree
in
which
it
results
spontaneously
from
a
sense
of
the
superior
s
goodness
and
wisdom
nor
do
i
think
that
any
decided
enunciation
of
duty
on
this
point
can
be
extracted
from
common
sense
we
have
next
to
consider
the
duties
of
affection
that
arise
out
of
relationships
voluntarily
assumed
of
these
the
most
important
is
the
conjugal
relation
and
here
we
may
begin
by
asking
whether
it
be
the
duty
of
human
beings
generally
to
enter
into
this
relation
it
is
no
doubt
normal
to
do
so
and
most
persons
are
prompted
to
it
by
strong
desires
but
in
so
far
as
it
can
be
said
to
be
prescribed
by
common
sense
it
does
not
seem
an
independent
duty
but
derivative
from
and
subordinate
to
the
general
maxims
of
prudence
and
benevolence
and
in
all
modern
civilised
societies
law
and
custom
leave
the
conjugal
union
perfectly
optional
but
the
conditions
under
which
it
may
be
formed
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
mutual
rights
and
duties
arising
out
of
it
are
carefully
laid
down
by
law
and
it
is
widely
thought
that
this
department
of
law
more
than
others
ought
to
be
governed
by
independent
moral
principles
and
to
protect
as
it
were
by
an
outer
barrier
the
kind
of
relation
which
morality
prescribes
if
we
ask
what
these
principles
are
common
sense
in
modern
european
communities
seems
to
answer
that
the
marriage
union
ought
to
be
exclusively
monogamic
at
least
designed
to
be
permanent
and
not
within
certain
degrees
of
consanguinity
i
do
not
however
think
that
any
of
these
propositions
can
on
reflection
be
maintained
to
be
even
against
incest
we
seem
to
have
rather
an
intense
sentiment
than
a
clear
intuition
and
it
is
generally
recognised
that
the
prohibition
of
all
but
monogamic
unions
can
only
be
rationally
maintained
on
utilitarian
grounds
as
regards
the
permanence
of
the
all
would
no
doubt
agree
that
fidelity
is
admirable
in
all
affections
and
especially
in
so
close
and
intimate
a
relation
as
the
conjugal
but
we
can
not
tell
how
far
it
is
possible
to
prevent
decay
of
love
in
all
cases
and
it
is
certainly
not
that
the
conjugal
relation
ought
to
be
maintained
when
love
has
ceased
nor
that
if
the
parties
have
separated
by
mutual
consent
they
ought
to
be
prohibited
from
forming
fresh
unions
in
so
far
as
we
are
convinced
of
the
rightness
of
this
regulation
it
is
always
i
think
from
a
consideration
of
the
generally
mischievous
consequences
that
would
ensue
if
it
were
relaxed
further
in
considering
the
evils
on
the
opposite
side
we
are
led
to
see
that
there
is
no
little
difference
of
opinion
among
moral
persons
as
to
the
kind
of
feeling
which
is
morally
indispensable
to
this
relation
for
some
would
say
that
marriage
without
intense
and
exclusive
affection
is
degrading
even
though
sanctioned
by
law
while
others
would
consider
this
a
mere
matter
of
taste
or
at
least
of
prudence
provided
there
was
no
mutual
deception
and
between
these
two
views
we
might
insert
several
different
shades
of
opinion
nor
again
is
there
agreement
as
to
the
external
duties
arising
out
of
the
relationship
for
all
would
lay
down
conjugal
fidelity
and
mutual
assistance
according
to
the
customary
division
of
labour
between
men
and
women
unless
this
should
be
modified
by
mutual
agreement
but
beyond
this
we
find
divergence
for
some
state
that
the
marriage
contract
binds
each
party
whenever
individual
gratification
is
concerned
to
prefer
the
happiness
of
the
other
party
to
its
own
while
others
would
say
that
this
degree
of
unselfishness
is
certainly
admirable
but
as
a
mere
matter
of
duty
it
is
enough
if
each
considers
the
other
s
happiness
equally
with
his
or
her
own
and
as
to
the
powers
and
liberties
that
ought
to
be
allowed
to
the
wife
and
the
obedience
due
from
her
to
the
husband
i
need
scarcely
at
the
present
time
waste
space
in
proving
that
there
is
no
of
moral
opinion
the
conjugal
relation
is
in
its
origin
of
free
choice
but
when
it
has
once
been
formed
the
duties
of
affection
that
arise
out
of
it
are
commonly
thought
to
be
analogous
to
those
arising
out
of
relations
of
consanguinity
it
therefore
holds
an
intermediate
position
between
these
latter
and
ordinary
friendships
partnerships
and
associations
which
men
are
equally
free
to
make
and
to
dissolve
now
most
associations
that
men
form
are
for
certain
definite
ends
determined
by
express
contract
or
tacit
understanding
accordingly
the
duty
arising
out
of
them
is
merely
that
of
fidelity
to
such
contract
or
understanding
which
will
be
considered
later
under
the
heads
of
justice
and
good
faith
but
this
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
with
what
in
a
strict
sense
of
the
term
are
called
friendships
for
although
friendship
frequently
arises
among
persons
associated
for
other
ends
yet
the
relation
is
always
conceived
to
have
its
end
in
itself
and
to
be
formed
primarily
for
the
development
of
mutual
affection
between
the
friends
and
the
pleasure
which
attends
this
still
it
is
thought
that
when
such
an
affection
has
once
been
formed
it
creates
mutual
duties
which
did
not
previously
exist
we
have
therefore
to
inquire
how
far
this
is
the
case
and
on
what
principles
these
can
be
determined
now
here
a
new
kind
of
difficulty
has
to
be
added
to
those
which
we
have
already
found
in
attempting
to
formulate
common
sense
for
we
find
some
who
say
that
as
it
is
essential
to
friendship
that
the
mutual
kindly
feeling
and
the
services
springing
from
it
should
be
spontaneous
and
unforced
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
should
be
imposed
as
a
duty
and
in
short
that
this
department
of
life
should
be
fenced
from
the
intrusion
of
moral
precepts
and
left
to
the
free
play
of
natural
instinct
and
this
doctrine
all
would
perhaps
admit
to
a
certain
extent
as
indeed
we
have
accepted
it
with
regard
to
all
the
deeper
flow
and
finer
expression
of
feeling
even
in
the
domestic
relations
for
it
seemed
pedantic
and
futile
to
prescribe
rules
for
this
or
even
though
we
naturally
admire
and
praise
any
not
ungraceful
exhibition
of
intense
and
genuine
affection
to
delineate
an
ideal
of
excellence
for
all
to
aim
at
still
there
seemed
to
be
an
important
sphere
of
strict
duty
however
hard
to
define
in
the
relations
of
children
to
parents
and
even
in
the
case
of
friendship
it
seems
contrary
to
common
sense
to
recognise
no
such
sphere
as
it
not
unfrequently
occurs
to
us
to
judge
that
one
friend
has
behaved
wrongly
to
another
and
to
speak
as
if
there
were
a
clearly
cognisable
code
of
behaviour
in
such
relations
perhaps
however
we
may
say
that
all
clear
cases
of
wrong
conduct
towards
friends
come
under
the
general
formula
of
breach
of
understanding
friends
not
unfrequently
make
definite
promises
of
service
but
we
need
not
consider
these
as
their
violation
is
prohibited
by
a
different
and
clearer
moral
rule
but
further
as
all
love
is
understood
to
include
a
desire
for
the
happiness
of
its
object
the
profession
of
friendship
seems
to
bind
one
to
seek
this
happiness
to
an
extent
proportionate
to
such
profession
now
common
benevolence
cf
prescribes
at
least
that
we
should
render
to
other
men
such
services
as
we
can
render
without
any
sacrifice
or
with
a
sacrifice
so
trifling
as
to
be
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
service
rendered
and
since
the
profession
of
friendship
though
the
term
is
used
to
include
affections
of
various
degree
must
imply
a
greater
interest
in
one
s
friend
s
happiness
than
in
that
of
men
in
general
it
must
announce
a
willingness
to
make
more
or
less
considerable
sacrifices
for
him
if
occasion
offers
if
then
we
decline
to
make
such
sacrifices
we
do
wrong
by
failing
to
fulfil
natural
and
legitimate
expectations
so
far
there
seems
no
source
of
difficulty
except
the
indefiniteness
inevitably
arising
from
the
wide
range
of
meanings
covered
by
the
term
friendship
but
further
questions
arise
in
consequence
of
the
changes
of
feeling
to
which
human
nature
is
liable
first
whether
it
is
our
duty
to
resist
such
changes
as
much
as
we
can
and
secondly
whether
if
this
effort
fails
and
love
diminishes
or
departs
we
ought
still
to
maintain
a
disposition
to
render
services
corresponding
to
our
past
affection
and
on
these
points
there
does
not
seem
to
be
agreement
among
moral
and
refined
persons
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
natural
to
us
to
admire
fidelity
in
friendship
and
stability
of
affections
and
we
commonly
regard
these
as
most
important
excellences
of
character
and
so
it
seems
strange
if
we
are
not
to
aim
at
these
as
at
all
other
excellences
as
none
more
naturally
stir
us
to
imitation
and
hence
many
would
be
prepared
to
lay
down
that
we
ought
not
to
withdraw
affection
once
given
unless
the
friend
behaves
ill
while
some
would
say
that
even
in
this
case
we
ought
not
to
break
the
friendship
unless
the
crime
is
very
great
yet
on
the
other
hand
we
feel
that
such
affection
as
is
produced
by
deliberate
effort
of
will
is
but
a
poor
substitute
for
that
which
springs
spontaneously
and
most
refined
persons
would
reject
such
a
boon
while
again
to
conceal
the
change
of
feeling
seems
insincere
and
hypocritical
but
as
for
services
a
refined
person
would
not
accept
such
from
a
former
friend
who
no
longer
loves
him
unless
in
extreme
need
when
any
kind
of
tie
is
as
it
were
invigorated
by
the
already
strong
claim
which
common
humanity
gives
each
man
upon
all
others
perhaps
therefore
there
can
not
be
a
duty
to
offer
such
services
in
any
case
when
the
need
is
not
extreme
though
this
inference
is
not
quite
clear
for
in
relations
of
affection
we
often
praise
one
party
for
offering
what
we
rather
blame
the
other
for
accepting
but
it
seems
that
delicate
questions
of
this
kind
are
more
naturally
referred
to
canons
of
good
taste
and
refined
feeling
than
of
morality
proper
or
at
least
only
included
in
the
scope
of
morality
in
so
far
as
we
have
a
general
duty
to
cultivate
good
taste
and
refinement
of
feeling
like
other
excellences
on
the
whole
then
we
may
say
that
the
chief
difficulties
in
determining
the
moral
obligations
of
friendship
arise
from
the
indefiniteness
of
the
tacit
understanding
implied
in
the
relation
and
from
the
disagreement
which
we
find
as
to
the
extent
to
which
fidelity
is
a
positive
duty
it
may
be
observed
that
the
latter
difficulty
is
especially
prominent
in
respect
of
those
intimacies
between
persons
of
different
sex
which
precede
and
prepare
the
way
for
marriage
i
pass
now
to
the
third
head
gratitude
it
has
been
already
observed
that
the
obligation
of
children
to
parents
is
sometimes
based
upon
this
and
in
other
affectionate
relationships
it
commonly
blends
with
and
much
strengthens
the
claims
that
are
thought
to
arise
out
of
the
relations
themselves
though
none
of
the
duties
that
we
have
discussed
seem
referable
entirely
to
gratitude
but
where
gratitude
is
due
the
obligation
is
especially
clear
and
simple
indeed
the
duty
of
requiting
benefits
seems
to
be
recognised
wherever
morality
extends
and
intuitionists
have
justly
pointed
to
this
recognition
as
an
instance
of
a
truly
universal
intuition
still
though
the
general
force
of
the
obligation
is
not
open
to
doubt
except
of
the
sweeping
and
abstract
kind
with
which
we
have
not
here
to
deal
its
nature
and
extent
are
by
no
means
equally
clear
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
asked
whether
we
are
only
bound
to
repay
services
or
whether
we
owe
the
special
affection
called
gratitude
which
seems
generally
to
combine
kindly
feeling
and
eagerness
to
requite
with
some
sort
of
emotional
recognition
of
superiority
as
the
giver
of
benefits
is
in
a
position
of
superiority
to
the
receiver
on
the
one
hand
we
seem
to
think
that
in
so
far
as
any
affection
can
possibly
be
a
duty
kindly
feeling
towards
benefactors
must
be
such
and
yet
to
persons
of
a
certain
temperament
this
feeling
is
often
peculiarly
hard
to
attain
owing
to
their
dislike
of
the
position
of
inferiority
and
this
again
we
consider
a
right
feeling
to
a
certain
extent
and
call
it
independence
or
proper
pride
but
this
feeling
and
the
effusion
of
gratitude
do
not
easily
mix
and
the
moralist
finds
it
difficult
to
recommend
a
proper
combination
of
the
two
perhaps
it
makes
a
great
difference
whether
the
service
be
lovingly
done
as
in
this
case
it
seems
inhuman
that
there
should
be
no
response
of
affection
whereas
if
the
benefit
be
coldly
given
the
mere
recognition
of
the
obligation
and
settled
disposition
to
repay
it
seem
to
suffice
and
independence
alone
would
prompt
a
man
to
repay
the
benefit
in
order
to
escape
from
the
burden
of
obligation
but
it
seems
doubtful
whether
in
any
case
we
are
morally
satisfied
with
this
as
the
sole
motive
it
is
partly
this
impatience
of
obligation
which
makes
a
man
desirous
of
giving
as
requital
more
than
he
has
received
for
otherwise
his
benefactor
has
still
the
superiority
of
having
taken
the
initiative
but
also
the
worthier
motive
of
affection
urges
us
in
the
same
direction
and
here
as
in
other
affectionate
services
we
do
not
like
too
exact
a
measure
of
duty
a
certain
excess
falling
short
of
extravagance
seems
to
be
what
we
admire
and
praise
in
so
far
however
as
conflict
of
claims
makes
it
needful
to
be
exact
we
think
perhaps
that
an
equal
return
is
what
the
duty
of
gratitude
requires
or
rather
willingness
to
make
such
a
return
if
it
be
required
and
if
it
is
in
our
power
to
make
it
without
neglecting
prior
claims
for
we
do
not
think
it
obligatory
to
requite
services
in
all
cases
even
if
it
be
in
our
power
to
do
so
if
the
benefactor
appear
to
be
sufficiently
supplied
with
the
means
of
happiness
but
if
he
either
demand
it
or
obviously
stand
in
need
of
it
we
think
it
ungrateful
not
to
make
an
equal
return
but
when
we
try
to
define
this
notion
of
equal
return
obscurity
and
divergence
begin
for
apart
from
the
difficulty
of
comparing
different
kinds
of
services
where
we
can
not
make
repayment
in
kind
equality
has
two
distinct
meanings
according
as
we
consider
the
effort
made
by
the
benefactor
or
the
service
rendered
to
the
benefited
now
perhaps
if
either
of
these
be
great
the
gratitude
is
naturally
strong
for
the
apprehension
of
great
earnestness
in
another
to
serve
us
tends
to
draw
from
us
a
proportionate
response
of
affection
and
any
great
pleasure
or
relief
from
pain
naturally
produces
a
corresponding
emotion
of
thankfulness
to
the
man
who
has
voluntarily
caused
this
even
though
his
effort
may
have
been
slight
and
hence
it
has
been
suggested
that
in
proportioning
the
dues
of
gratitude
we
ought
to
take
whichever
of
the
two
considerations
will
give
the
highest
estimate
but
this
does
not
seem
in
accordance
with
common
sense
for
the
benefit
may
be
altogether
unacceptable
and
it
is
hard
to
bind
us
to
repay
in
full
every
blundering
effort
to
serve
us
though
we
feel
vaguely
that
some
return
should
be
made
even
for
this
and
though
it
is
more
plausible
to
say
that
we
ought
to
requite
an
accepted
service
without
weighing
the
amount
of
our
benefactor
s
sacrifice
still
when
we
take
extreme
cases
the
rule
seems
not
to
be
valid
if
a
poor
man
sees
a
rich
one
drowning
and
pulls
him
out
of
the
water
we
do
not
think
that
the
latter
is
bound
to
give
as
a
reward
what
he
would
have
been
willing
to
give
for
his
life
still
we
should
think
him
niggardly
if
he
only
gave
his
preserver
which
might
however
be
profuse
repayment
for
the
cost
of
the
exertion
something
between
the
two
seems
to
suit
our
moral
taste
but
i
find
no
clear
accepted
principle
upon
which
the
amount
can
be
decided
the
last
claim
to
be
considered
is
that
of
special
need
this
has
been
substantially
stated
already
in
investigating
the
obligation
of
general
benevolence
or
common
humanity
for
it
was
said
that
we
owe
to
all
men
such
services
as
we
can
render
by
a
sacrifice
or
effort
small
in
comparison
with
the
service
and
hence
in
proportion
as
the
needs
of
other
men
present
themselves
as
urgent
we
recognise
the
duty
of
relieving
them
out
of
our
superfluity
but
i
have
thought
it
right
to
notice
the
duty
separately
because
we
are
commonly
prompted
to
fulfil
it
by
the
specific
emotion
of
pity
or
compassion
here
again
there
seems
a
doubt
how
far
it
is
good
to
foster
and
encourage
this
emotion
as
distinct
from
the
practical
habit
of
rendering
prompt
aid
and
succour
in
distress
whenever
such
succour
is
judged
to
be
right
on
the
one
hand
the
emotional
impulse
tends
to
make
the
action
of
relieving
need
not
only
easier
to
the
agent
but
more
graceful
and
pleasing
on
the
other
hand
it
is
generally
recognised
that
mistaken
pity
is
more
likely
to
lead
us
astray
than
mistaken
gratitude
as
it
is
more
liable
to
interfere
dangerously
with
the
infliction
of
penalties
required
for
the
maintenance
of
social
order
or
with
the
operation
of
motives
to
industry
and
thrift
necessary
for
economic
and
when
to
guard
against
the
danger
we
try
to
define
the
external
duty
of
relieving
want
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
what
is
no
mere
problem
of
the
closet
but
a
serious
practical
perplexity
to
most
moral
persons
at
the
present
day
for
many
ask
whether
it
is
not
our
duty
to
refrain
from
all
superfluous
indulgences
until
we
have
removed
the
misery
and
want
that
exist
around
us
as
far
as
they
are
removable
by
money
and
in
answering
this
question
common
sense
seems
to
be
inevitably
led
to
a
consideration
of
the
economic
consequences
of
attempting
either
by
taxation
and
public
expenditure
or
by
the
voluntary
gifts
of
private
persons
to
provide
a
sufficient
income
for
all
needy
members
of
the
community
and
is
thus
gradually
brought
to
substitute
for
the
intuitional
method
of
dealing
with
problems
of
this
kind
a
different
procedure
having
at
least
much
affinity
with
the
utilitarian
method
in
conclusion
then
we
must
admit
that
while
we
find
a
number
of
broad
and
more
or
less
indefinite
rules
unhesitatingly
laid
down
by
common
sense
in
this
department
of
duty
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
extract
from
them
so
far
as
they
are
commonly
accepted
any
clear
and
precise
principles
for
determining
the
extent
of
the
duty
in
any
case
and
yet
as
we
saw
such
particular
principles
of
distribution
of
the
services
to
which
prompts
seem
to
be
required
for
the
perfection
of
practice
no
less
than
for
theoretical
completeness
in
so
far
as
the
duties
which
we
have
been
considering
are
liable
to
come
into
apparent
conflict
with
each
other
and
with
other
prescriptions
of
the
moral
code
in
reply
it
may
perhaps
be
contended
that
if
we
are
seeking
exactness
in
the
determination
of
duty
we
have
begun
by
examining
the
wrong
notion
that
in
short
we
ought
to
have
examined
justice
rather
than
benevolence
it
may
be
admitted
that
we
can
not
find
as
much
exactness
as
we
sometimes
practically
need
by
merely
considering
the
common
conceptions
of
the
duties
to
which
men
are
prompted
by
natural
affections
but
it
may
still
be
maintained
that
we
shall
at
any
rate
find
such
exactness
adequately
provided
for
under
the
head
of
justice
this
contention
i
will
proceed
to
examine
in
the
next
chapter
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
throughout
the
discussion
carried
on
in
this
and
the
next
six
chapters
that
what
we
are
primarily
endeavouring
to
ascertain
is
not
true
morality
but
the
morality
of
common
sense
so
that
if
any
moral
proposition
is
admitted
to
be
paradoxical
the
admission
excludes
it
not
as
being
necessarily
false
but
as
being
not
what
common
sense
holds
footnotes
the
qualifications
which
this
proposition
requires
have
been
already
noticed
and
will
be
further
illustrated
as
we
proceed
the
phase
of
this
view
most
current
at
present
would
seem
to
be
utilitarianism
the
principles
and
method
of
which
will
be
more
fully
discussed
hereafter
but
in
some
form
or
degree
it
has
been
held
by
many
whose
affinities
are
rather
with
the
intuitional
school
see
note
at
end
of
chapter
cf
book
chaps
vii
ix
a
further
reason
for
so
doing
will
appear
in
the
sequel
when
we
come
to
survey
the
general
relation
of
virtue
to
happiness
as
the
result
of
that
detailed
examination
of
the
particular
virtues
which
forms
the
main
subject
of
the
present
book
cf
chap
xiv
of
this
book
this
reluctance
however
seems
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
this
precise
measure
of
duty
is
most
frequently
demanded
when
the
issue
lies
between
duty
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
more
the
benevolent
impulse
is
combined
with
the
habit
of
considering
the
complex
consequences
of
different
courses
of
action
that
may
be
presented
as
alternatives
and
comparing
the
amounts
of
happiness
to
others
respectively
resulting
from
them
the
more
good
is
likely
to
be
caused
by
it
on
the
whole
and
so
far
as
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
natural
incompatibility
between
this
habit
of
calculation
and
comparison
and
the
spontaneous
fervour
of
kindly
impulse
common
sense
is
somewhat
puzzled
which
to
prefer
and
takes
refuge
in
an
ideal
that
transcends
this
incompatibility
and
includes
the
two
this
question
will
be
further
discussed
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
this
book
chap
it
may
be
said
that
a
child
owes
gratitude
to
the
authors
of
its
existence
but
life
alone
apart
from
any
provision
for
making
life
happy
seems
a
boon
of
doubtful
value
and
one
that
scarcely
excites
gratitude
when
it
was
not
conferred
from
any
regard
for
the
recipient
in
it
was
affirmed
in
an
act
passed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
the
right
of
expatriation
is
a
natural
and
inherent
right
of
all
i
do
not
know
how
far
this
would
be
taken
to
imply
that
a
man
has
a
moral
right
to
leave
his
country
whenever
he
finds
it
convenient
provided
no
claims
except
those
of
patriotism
retain
him
there
but
if
it
was
intended
to
imply
this
i
think
the
statement
would
not
be
accepted
in
europe
without
important
limitations
though
i
can
not
state
any
generally
accepted
principle
from
which
such
limitations
could
be
clearly
deduced
how
far
we
are
bound
to
make
reparation
when
the
harm
is
involuntary
and
such
as
could
not
have
been
prevented
by
ordinary
care
on
our
part
is
not
clear
but
it
will
be
convenient
to
defer
the
consideration
of
this
till
the
next
chapter
as
the
whole
of
this
department
of
duty
is
more
commonly
placed
under
the
head
of
justice
i
raise
this
question
because
if
the
rule
of
living
according
to
nature
were
really
adopted
as
a
first
principle
in
any
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
nature
it
would
certainly
seem
to
be
the
duty
of
all
normal
human
beings
to
enter
into
conjugal
relations
but
just
this
instance
seems
to
show
that
the
principle
is
not
accepted
by
common
sense
see
book
chap
vi
the
moral
necessity
of
prohibiting
polygamy
is
sometimes
put
forward
as
an
immediate
inference
from
the
equality
of
the
numbers
of
the
two
sexes
this
argument
however
seems
to
require
the
assumption
that
all
men
and
women
ought
to
marry
but
this
scarcely
any
one
will
expressly
affirm
and
actually
considerable
numbers
remain
unmarried
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
countries
where
polygamy
is
allowed
paucity
of
supply
has
ever
made
it
practically
difficult
for
any
man
to
find
a
mate
cf
wayland
of
moral
book
ii
part
ii
class
i
use
the
term
here
to
imply
a
mutual
affection
more
intense
than
the
kindly
feeling
which
a
moral
man
desires
to
find
towards
all
persons
with
whom
he
is
brought
into
continual
social
relations
through
business
or
otherwise
it
was
before
observed
that
this
is
only
one
and
not
always
the
most
prominent
element
of
the
whole
emotional
state
which
we
call
love
see
book
iv
chap
iii
chapter
v
justice
we
have
seen
that
in
delineating
the
outline
of
duty
as
intuitively
recognised
we
have
to
attempt
to
give
to
common
terms
a
definite
and
precise
meaning
this
process
of
definition
always
requires
some
reflection
and
care
and
is
sometimes
one
of
considerable
difficulty
but
there
is
no
case
where
the
difficulty
is
greater
or
the
result
more
disputed
than
when
we
try
to
define
justice
before
making
the
attempt
it
may
be
as
well
to
remind
the
reader
what
it
is
that
we
have
to
do
we
have
not
to
inquire
into
the
derivation
of
the
notion
of
justice
as
we
are
not
now
studying
the
history
of
our
ethical
thought
but
its
actual
condition
nor
can
we
profess
to
furnish
a
definition
which
will
correspond
to
every
part
of
the
common
usage
of
the
term
for
many
persons
are
undoubtedly
vague
and
loose
in
their
application
of
current
moral
notions
but
it
is
an
assumption
of
the
intuitional
method
that
the
term
justice
denotes
a
quality
which
it
is
ultimately
desirable
to
realise
in
the
conduct
and
social
relations
of
men
and
that
a
definition
may
be
given
of
this
which
will
be
accepted
by
all
competent
judges
as
presenting
in
a
clear
and
explicit
form
what
they
have
always
meant
by
the
term
though
perhaps
implicitly
and
vaguely
in
seeking
such
a
definition
we
may
so
to
speak
clip
the
ragged
edge
of
common
usage
but
we
must
not
make
excision
of
any
considerable
portion
perhaps
the
first
point
that
strikes
us
when
we
reflect
upon
our
notion
of
justice
is
its
connexion
with
law
there
is
no
doubt
that
just
conduct
is
to
a
great
extent
determined
by
law
and
in
certain
applications
the
two
terms
seem
interchangeable
thus
we
speak
indifferently
of
law
courts
and
courts
of
justice
and
when
a
private
citizen
demands
justice
or
his
just
rights
he
commonly
means
to
demand
that
law
should
be
carried
into
effect
still
reflection
shows
that
we
do
not
mean
by
justice
merely
conformity
to
law
for
first
we
do
not
always
call
the
violators
of
law
unjust
but
only
of
some
laws
not
for
example
duellists
or
gamblers
and
secondly
we
often
judge
that
law
as
it
exists
does
not
completely
realise
justice
our
notion
of
justice
furnishes
a
standard
with
which
we
compare
actual
laws
and
pronounce
them
just
or
unjust
and
thirdly
there
is
a
part
of
just
conduct
which
lies
outside
the
sphere
even
of
law
as
it
ought
to
be
for
example
we
think
that
a
father
may
be
just
or
unjust
to
his
children
in
matters
where
the
law
leaves
and
ought
to
leave
him
free
we
must
then
distinguish
justice
from
what
has
been
called
the
virtue
or
duty
of
order
or
and
perhaps
if
we
examine
the
points
of
divergence
just
mentioned
we
shall
be
led
to
the
true
definition
of
justice
let
us
therefore
first
ask
of
what
kind
of
laws
is
the
observance
generally
thought
to
be
a
realisation
of
justice
in
most
cases
they
might
be
described
as
laws
which
define
and
secure
the
interests
of
assignable
individuals
but
this
description
is
not
complete
as
justice
is
admittedly
concerned
in
the
apportionment
of
adequate
punishment
to
each
offender
though
we
should
not
say
that
a
man
had
an
interest
in
the
adequacy
of
his
punishment
let
us
say
then
that
the
laws
in
which
justice
is
or
ought
to
be
realised
are
laws
which
distribute
and
allot
to
individuals
either
objects
of
desire
liberties
and
privileges
or
burdens
and
restraints
or
even
pains
as
such
these
latter
however
are
only
allotted
by
law
to
persons
who
have
broken
other
laws
and
as
all
law
is
enforced
by
penalties
we
see
how
the
administration
of
law
generally
may
be
viewed
as
the
administration
of
justice
in
accordance
with
this
definition
not
because
all
laws
are
primarily
and
in
their
first
intention
distributive
but
because
the
execution
of
law
generally
involves
the
due
allotment
of
pains
and
losses
and
restraints
to
the
persons
who
violate
it
or
more
precisely
we
should
say
that
this
legal
distribution
to
realise
justice
for
we
have
seen
that
it
may
fail
to
do
so
we
have
next
to
ask
therefore
what
conditions
must
laws
fulfil
in
order
that
they
may
be
just
in
their
distributive
effects
here
however
it
may
seem
that
we
are
transgressing
the
limit
which
divides
ethics
from
politics
for
ethics
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
rules
which
ought
to
govern
the
private
conduct
of
individuals
and
it
is
commonly
thought
that
private
persons
ought
to
obey
even
laws
that
they
regard
as
unjust
if
established
by
lawful
authority
still
this
is
doubted
in
the
case
of
laws
that
seem
extremely
unjust
as
the
fugitive
slave
law
in
the
united
states
before
the
rebellion
at
any
rate
it
seems
desirable
that
we
should
here
digress
somewhat
into
political
discussion
partly
in
order
to
elucidate
the
notion
of
justice
which
seems
to
be
essentially
the
same
in
both
regions
and
partly
because
it
is
of
great
practical
importance
to
individuals
in
regulating
private
conduct
beyond
the
range
of
to
know
whether
the
laws
and
established
order
of
the
society
in
which
they
live
are
just
or
unjust
now
perhaps
the
most
obvious
and
commonly
recognised
characteristic
of
just
laws
is
that
they
are
equal
and
in
some
departments
of
legislation
at
least
the
common
notion
of
justice
seems
to
be
exhaustively
expressed
by
that
of
equality
it
is
commonly
thought
for
example
that
a
system
of
taxation
would
be
perfectly
just
if
it
imposed
exactly
equal
burdens
upon
all
and
though
this
notion
of
equal
burden
is
itself
somewhat
difficult
to
define
with
the
precision
required
for
practical
application
still
we
may
say
that
justice
here
is
thought
to
resolve
itself
into
a
kind
of
equality
however
we
can
not
affirm
generally
that
all
laws
ought
to
affect
all
persons
equally
for
this
would
leave
no
place
for
any
laws
allotting
special
privileges
and
burdens
to
special
classes
of
the
community
but
we
do
not
think
all
such
laws
necessarily
unjust
we
think
it
not
unjust
that
only
persons
appointed
in
a
certain
way
should
share
in
legislation
and
that
men
should
be
forced
to
fight
for
their
country
but
not
women
hence
some
have
said
that
the
only
sense
in
which
justice
requires
a
law
to
be
equal
is
that
its
execution
must
affect
equally
all
the
individuals
belonging
to
any
of
the
classes
specified
in
the
law
and
no
doubt
this
rule
excludes
a
very
real
kind
of
injustice
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
judges
and
administrators
should
never
be
persuaded
by
money
or
otherwise
to
show
respect
of
so
much
equality
however
is
involved
in
the
very
notion
of
a
law
if
it
be
couched
in
general
terms
and
it
is
plain
that
laws
may
be
equally
executed
and
yet
unjust
for
example
we
should
consider
a
law
unjust
which
compelled
only
men
to
serve
in
the
army
even
though
it
were
applied
with
the
strictest
impartiality
to
all
men
we
must
therefore
conclude
that
in
laying
down
the
law
no
less
than
in
carrying
it
out
all
inequality
affecting
the
interests
of
individuals
which
appears
arbitrary
and
for
which
no
sufficient
reason
can
be
given
is
held
to
be
unjust
but
we
have
still
to
ask
what
kind
of
reasons
for
inequality
justice
admits
and
from
what
general
principle
or
principles
all
such
reasons
are
to
be
deduced
perhaps
we
shall
find
it
easier
to
answer
this
question
if
we
examine
the
notion
of
justice
as
applied
to
that
part
of
private
conduct
which
lies
beyond
the
sphere
of
law
here
again
we
may
observe
that
the
notion
of
justice
always
involves
allotment
of
something
considered
as
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
whether
it
be
money
or
other
material
means
of
happiness
or
praise
or
affection
or
other
immaterial
good
or
some
merited
pain
or
loss
hence
i
should
answer
the
question
raised
in
the
preceding
chapter
as
to
the
classification
of
the
duties
there
discussed
under
the
heads
of
justice
and
benevolence
respectively
by
saying
that
the
fulfilment
of
any
duty
of
the
affections
considered
by
itself
does
not
exemplify
justice
but
that
when
we
come
to
compare
the
obligations
arising
out
of
different
affectionate
relations
and
to
consider
the
right
allotment
of
love
and
kind
services
the
notion
of
justice
becomes
applicable
in
order
to
arrange
this
allotment
properly
we
have
to
inquire
what
is
just
what
then
do
we
mean
by
a
just
man
in
matters
where
does
not
enter
it
is
natural
to
reply
that
we
mean
an
impartial
man
one
who
seeks
with
equal
care
to
satisfy
all
claims
which
he
recognises
as
valid
and
does
not
let
himself
be
unduly
influenced
by
personal
preferences
and
this
seems
an
adequate
account
of
the
virtue
of
justice
so
far
as
we
consider
it
merely
subjectively
and
independently
of
the
intellectual
insight
required
for
the
realisation
of
objective
justice
in
action
if
we
neglect
to
give
due
consideration
to
any
claim
which
we
regard
as
reasonable
our
action
can
not
be
just
in
intention
this
definition
suffices
to
exclude
wilful
injustice
but
it
is
obvious
that
it
does
not
give
us
a
sufficient
criterion
of
just
acts
any
more
than
the
absence
of
arbitrary
inequality
was
found
to
be
a
sufficient
criterion
of
just
laws
we
want
to
know
what
are
reasonable
claims
well
of
these
the
most
important
apart
from
the
claims
discussed
in
the
preceding
chapter
seems
to
be
that
resulting
from
contract
this
is
to
a
certain
extent
enforced
by
law
but
it
is
clear
to
us
that
a
just
man
will
keep
engagements
generally
even
when
there
may
be
no
legal
penalty
attached
to
their
violation
the
exact
definition
of
this
duty
and
its
commonly
admitted
qualifications
will
be
discussed
in
the
next
chapter
but
of
its
general
bindingness
common
sense
has
no
doubt
further
we
include
under
the
idea
of
binding
engagements
not
merely
verbal
promises
but
also
what
are
called
implied
contracts
or
tacit
but
this
latter
term
is
a
difficult
one
to
keep
precise
and
in
fact
is
often
used
to
include
not
only
the
case
where
has
in
some
way
positively
implied
a
pledge
to
but
also
the
case
where
has
certain
expectations
of
which
is
aware
here
however
the
obligation
is
not
so
clear
for
it
would
hardly
be
said
that
a
man
is
bound
to
dispel
all
erroneous
expectations
that
he
may
know
to
be
formed
respecting
his
conduct
at
the
risk
of
being
required
to
fulfil
them
still
if
the
expectation
was
such
as
most
persons
would
form
under
the
circumstances
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
moral
obligation
to
fulfil
it
if
it
does
not
conflict
with
other
duties
though
the
obligation
seems
less
definite
and
stringent
than
that
arising
out
of
contract
indeed
i
think
we
may
say
that
justice
is
generally
though
somewhat
vaguely
held
to
prescribe
the
fulfilment
of
all
such
expectations
of
services
etc
as
arise
naturally
and
normally
out
of
the
relations
voluntary
or
involuntary
in
which
we
stand
towards
other
human
beings
but
the
discussions
in
the
preceding
chapter
have
shown
the
difficulty
of
defining
even
those
duties
of
this
kind
which
in
an
indefinite
form
seemed
certain
and
indisputable
while
others
are
only
defined
by
customs
which
to
reflection
appear
arbitrary
and
though
while
these
customs
persist
the
expectations
springing
from
them
are
in
a
certain
sense
natural
so
that
a
just
man
seems
to
be
under
a
kind
of
obligation
to
fulfil
them
this
obligation
can
not
be
regarded
as
clear
or
complete
for
two
reasons
that
were
given
in
the
last
chapter
first
because
customs
are
continually
varying
and
as
long
as
any
one
is
in
a
state
of
variation
growing
or
decaying
the
validity
of
the
customary
claim
is
obviously
doubtful
and
secondly
because
it
does
not
seem
right
that
an
irrational
and
inexpedient
custom
should
last
for
ever
and
yet
it
can
only
be
abolished
by
being
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
this
line
of
reflection
therefore
has
landed
us
in
a
real
perplexity
respecting
the
department
of
duty
which
we
are
at
present
examining
justice
is
something
that
we
conceive
to
be
intrinsically
capable
of
perfectly
definite
determination
a
scrupulously
just
man
we
think
must
be
very
exact
and
precise
in
his
conduct
but
when
we
consider
that
part
of
justice
which
consists
in
satisfying
such
natural
and
customary
claims
as
arise
independently
of
contract
it
seems
impossible
to
estimate
these
claims
with
any
exactness
the
attempt
to
map
out
the
region
of
justice
reveals
to
us
a
sort
of
margin
or
dim
borderland
tenanted
by
expectations
which
are
not
quite
claims
and
with
regard
to
which
we
do
not
feel
sure
whether
justice
does
or
does
not
require
us
to
satisfy
them
for
the
ordinary
actions
of
men
proceed
on
the
expectation
that
the
future
will
resemble
the
past
hence
it
seems
natural
to
expect
that
any
particular
man
will
do
as
others
do
in
similar
circumstances
and
still
more
that
he
will
continue
to
do
whatever
he
has
hitherto
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
accordingly
his
are
inclined
to
think
themselves
wronged
by
his
suddenly
omitting
any
customary
or
habitual
act
if
the
omission
causes
them
loss
or
inconvenience
on
the
other
hand
if
a
man
has
given
no
pledge
to
maintain
a
custom
or
habit
it
seems
hard
that
he
should
be
bound
by
the
unwarranted
expectations
of
others
in
this
perplexity
common
sense
often
appears
to
decide
differently
cases
similar
in
all
respects
except
in
the
quantity
of
disappointment
caused
by
the
change
for
instance
if
a
poor
man
were
to
leave
one
tradesman
and
deal
with
another
because
the
first
had
turned
quaker
we
should
hardly
call
it
an
act
of
injustice
however
unreasonable
we
might
think
it
but
if
a
rich
country
gentleman
were
to
act
similarly
towards
a
poor
neighbour
many
persons
would
say
that
it
was
unjust
persecution
the
difficulty
just
pointed
out
extends
equally
to
the
duties
of
kindness
even
to
the
specially
stringent
and
sacred
duties
of
the
domestic
affections
and
gratitude
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
we
can
not
get
any
new
principle
for
settling
any
conflict
that
may
present
itself
among
such
duties
by
asking
what
justice
requires
of
us
the
application
of
the
notion
of
justice
only
leads
us
to
view
the
problem
in
a
new
aspect
as
a
question
of
the
right
of
kind
services
it
does
not
help
us
to
solve
it
had
we
clear
and
precise
intuitive
principles
for
determining
the
claims
of
parents
on
children
children
on
parents
benefactors
on
the
recipients
of
their
benefits
we
might
say
exactly
at
what
point
or
to
what
extent
the
satisfaction
of
one
of
these
claims
ought
in
justice
to
be
postponed
to
the
satisfaction
of
another
or
to
any
worthy
aim
of
a
different
kind
but
i
know
no
method
of
determining
a
problem
of
this
kind
which
is
not
either
implicitly
utilitarian
or
arbitrarily
dogmatic
and
unsupported
by
common
sense
if
now
we
turn
again
to
the
political
question
from
which
we
diverged
we
see
that
we
have
obtained
from
the
preceding
discussion
one
of
the
criteria
of
the
justice
of
laws
which
we
were
seeking
viz
that
they
must
avoid
running
counter
to
natural
and
normal
expectations
but
we
see
at
the
same
time
that
the
criterion
can
not
be
made
definite
in
its
application
to
private
conduct
and
it
is
easy
to
show
that
there
is
the
same
indefiniteness
and
consequent
difficulty
in
applying
it
to
legislation
for
law
itself
is
a
main
source
of
natural
expectations
and
since
in
ordinary
times
the
alterations
in
law
are
very
small
in
proportion
to
the
amount
unaltered
there
is
always
a
natural
expectation
that
the
existing
laws
will
be
maintained
and
although
this
is
of
course
an
indefinite
and
uncertain
expectation
in
a
society
like
ours
where
laws
are
continually
being
altered
by
lawful
authority
it
is
sufficient
for
people
in
general
to
rely
upon
in
arranging
their
concerns
investing
their
money
choosing
their
place
of
abode
their
trade
and
profession
etc
hence
when
such
expectations
are
disappointed
by
a
change
in
the
law
the
disappointed
persons
complain
of
injustice
and
it
is
to
some
extent
admitted
that
justice
requires
that
they
should
be
compensated
for
the
loss
thus
incurred
but
such
expectations
are
of
all
degrees
of
definiteness
and
importance
and
generally
extend
more
widely
as
they
decrease
in
value
like
the
ripples
made
by
throwing
a
stone
into
a
pond
so
that
it
is
practically
impossible
to
compensate
them
all
at
the
same
time
i
know
no
intuitive
principle
by
which
we
could
separate
valid
claims
from
invalid
and
distinguish
injustice
from
simple
hardship
but
even
if
this
difficulty
were
overcome
further
reflection
must
i
think
show
that
the
criterion
above
given
is
incomplete
or
imperfectly
stated
otherwise
it
would
appear
that
no
old
law
could
be
unjust
since
laws
that
have
existed
for
a
long
time
must
create
corresponding
expectations
but
this
is
contrary
to
common
sense
as
we
are
continually
becoming
convinced
that
old
laws
are
unjust
laws
establishing
slavery
indeed
this
continually
recurring
conviction
seems
to
be
one
of
the
great
sources
of
change
in
the
laws
of
a
progressive
society
perhaps
we
may
say
that
there
are
natural
expectations
which
grow
up
from
other
elements
of
the
social
order
independent
of
and
so
possibly
conflicting
with
laws
and
that
we
call
rules
unjust
which
go
counter
to
these
thus
primogeniture
appears
to
many
unjust
because
all
the
landowner
s
children
are
brought
up
in
equally
luxurious
habits
and
share
equally
the
paternal
care
and
expenditure
and
so
the
inequality
of
inheritance
seems
paradoxical
and
harsh
still
we
can
not
explain
every
case
in
this
way
for
example
the
conviction
that
slavery
is
unjust
can
hardly
be
traced
to
anything
in
the
established
order
of
the
society
but
seems
to
arise
in
a
different
way
the
truth
is
this
notion
of
natural
expectations
is
worse
than
indefinite
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
conceals
a
fundamental
conflict
of
ideas
which
appears
more
profound
and
in
its
consequences
the
more
we
examine
it
for
the
word
natural
as
used
in
this
connexion
covers
and
conceals
the
whole
chasm
between
the
actual
and
the
ideal
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
as
we
before
noticed
the
term
seems
as
ordinarily
used
to
contain
the
distinct
ideas
of
the
common
as
opposed
to
the
exceptional
and
the
original
or
primitive
as
contrasted
with
the
result
of
later
conventions
and
institutions
but
it
is
also
used
to
signify
in
more
or
less
indefinite
combination
with
one
or
other
of
these
meanings
what
would
exist
in
an
ideal
state
of
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
these
different
meanings
have
been
blended
and
confounded
for
since
by
nature
men
have
really
meant
god
or
god
viewed
in
a
particular
aspect
god
we
may
say
as
known
to
us
in
experience
when
they
have
come
to
conceive
a
better
state
of
things
than
that
which
actually
exists
they
have
not
only
regarded
this
ideal
state
as
really
exhibiting
the
divine
purposes
more
than
the
actual
and
as
being
so
far
more
natural
but
they
have
gone
further
and
supposed
more
or
less
definitely
that
this
ideal
state
of
things
must
be
what
god
originally
created
and
that
the
defects
recognisable
in
what
now
exists
must
be
due
to
the
deteriorating
action
of
men
but
if
we
dismiss
this
latter
view
as
unsupported
by
historical
evidence
we
recognise
more
plainly
the
contrast
and
conflict
between
the
other
two
meanings
of
natural
and
the
corresponding
discrepancy
between
the
two
elements
of
the
common
notion
of
justice
for
from
one
point
of
view
we
are
disposed
to
think
that
the
distribution
of
rights
goods
and
privileges
as
well
as
burdens
and
pains
is
natural
and
just
and
that
this
ought
to
be
maintained
by
law
as
it
usually
is
while
from
another
point
of
view
we
seem
to
recognise
an
ideal
system
of
rules
of
distribution
which
ought
to
exist
but
perhaps
have
never
yet
existed
and
we
consider
laws
to
be
just
in
proportion
as
they
conform
to
this
ideal
it
is
the
reconciliation
between
these
two
views
which
is
the
chief
problem
of
political
justice
on
what
principles
then
is
the
ideal
to
be
determined
this
is
in
fact
the
question
which
has
been
chiefly
in
view
from
the
outset
of
the
chapter
but
we
could
not
satisfactorily
discuss
it
until
we
had
distinguished
the
two
elements
of
justice
as
commonly
conceived
one
conservative
of
law
and
custom
and
the
other
tending
to
reform
them
it
is
on
this
latter
that
we
shall
now
concentrate
our
attention
when
however
we
examine
this
ideal
as
it
seems
to
show
itself
in
the
minds
of
different
men
in
different
ages
and
countries
we
observe
various
forms
of
it
which
it
is
important
to
distinguish
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
noticed
that
an
ideal
constitution
of
society
may
be
conceived
and
sought
with
many
other
ends
in
view
besides
the
right
distribution
of
good
and
evil
among
the
individuals
that
compose
it
as
with
a
view
to
conquest
and
success
in
war
or
to
the
development
of
industry
and
commerce
or
to
the
highest
possible
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
but
any
such
political
ideal
as
this
is
beyond
the
range
of
our
present
consideration
as
it
is
not
constructed
on
the
basis
of
our
common
notion
of
justice
our
present
question
is
are
there
any
clear
principles
from
which
we
may
work
out
an
ideally
just
distribution
of
rights
and
privileges
burdens
and
pains
among
human
beings
as
such
there
is
a
view
that
in
order
to
make
society
just
certain
natural
rights
should
be
conceded
to
all
members
of
the
community
and
that
positive
law
should
at
least
embody
and
protect
these
whatever
other
regulations
it
may
contain
but
it
is
difficult
to
find
in
common
sense
any
definite
agreement
in
the
enumeration
of
these
natural
rights
still
less
any
clear
principles
from
which
they
can
be
systematically
deduced
there
is
however
one
mode
of
systematising
these
rights
and
bringing
them
under
one
principle
which
has
been
maintained
by
influential
thinkers
and
which
though
now
perhaps
somewhat
antiquated
is
still
sufficiently
current
to
deserve
careful
examination
it
has
been
held
that
freedom
from
interference
is
really
the
whole
of
what
human
beings
originally
and
apart
from
contracts
can
be
strictly
said
to
to
each
other
at
any
rate
that
the
protection
of
this
freedom
including
the
enforcement
of
free
contract
is
the
sole
proper
aim
of
law
of
those
rules
of
mutual
behaviour
which
are
maintained
by
penalties
inflicted
under
the
authority
of
government
all
natural
rights
on
this
view
may
be
summed
up
in
the
right
to
freedom
so
that
the
complete
and
universal
establishment
of
this
right
would
be
the
complete
realisation
of
justice
the
equality
at
which
justice
is
thought
to
aim
being
interpreted
as
equality
of
freedom
now
when
i
contemplate
this
as
an
abstract
formula
though
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
to
me
as
the
true
fundamental
principle
of
ideal
law
i
admit
that
it
commends
itself
much
to
my
mind
and
i
might
perhaps
persuade
myself
that
it
is
owing
to
the
defect
of
my
faculty
of
moral
or
jural
intuition
that
i
fail
to
see
its
but
when
i
endeavour
to
bring
it
into
closer
relation
to
the
actual
circumstances
of
human
society
it
soon
comes
to
wear
a
different
aspect
in
the
first
place
it
seems
obviously
needful
to
limit
the
extent
of
its
application
for
it
involves
the
negative
principle
that
no
one
should
be
coerced
for
his
own
good
alone
but
no
one
would
gravely
argue
that
this
ought
to
be
applied
to
the
case
of
children
or
of
idiots
or
insane
persons
but
if
so
can
we
know
that
it
ought
to
be
applied
to
all
sane
adults
since
the
exceptions
are
commonly
justified
on
the
ground
that
children
will
manifestly
be
better
off
if
they
are
forced
to
do
and
abstain
as
others
think
best
for
them
and
it
is
at
least
not
intuitively
certain
that
the
same
argument
does
not
apply
to
the
majority
of
mankind
in
the
present
state
of
their
intellectual
progress
indeed
it
is
often
conceded
by
the
advocates
of
this
principle
that
it
does
not
hold
even
in
respect
of
adults
in
a
low
state
of
civilisation
but
if
so
what
criterion
can
be
given
for
its
application
except
that
it
must
be
applied
wherever
human
beings
are
sufficiently
intelligent
to
provide
for
themselves
better
than
others
would
provide
for
them
and
thus
the
principle
would
present
itself
not
as
absolute
but
merely
a
subordinate
application
of
the
wider
principle
of
aiming
at
the
general
happiness
or
of
mankind
but
again
the
term
freedom
is
ambiguous
if
we
interpret
it
strictly
as
meaning
freedom
of
action
alone
the
principle
seems
to
allow
any
amount
of
mutual
annoyance
except
constraint
but
obviously
no
one
would
be
satisfied
with
such
freedom
as
this
if
however
we
include
in
the
idea
absence
of
pain
and
annoyance
inflicted
by
others
it
becomes
at
once
evident
that
we
can
not
prohibit
all
such
annoyances
without
restraining
freedom
of
action
to
a
degree
that
would
be
intolerable
since
there
is
scarcely
any
gratification
of
a
man
s
natural
impulses
which
may
not
cause
some
annoyance
to
others
hence
in
distinguishing
the
mutual
annoyances
that
ought
to
be
allowed
from
those
that
must
be
prohibited
we
seem
forced
to
balance
the
evils
of
constraint
against
pain
and
loss
of
a
different
kind
while
if
we
admit
the
utilitarian
criterion
so
far
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
that
annoyance
to
individuals
is
never
to
be
permitted
in
order
to
attain
any
positive
good
result
but
only
to
prevent
more
serious
annoyance
thirdly
in
order
to
render
a
social
construction
possible
on
this
basis
we
must
assume
that
the
right
to
freedom
includes
the
right
to
limit
one
s
freedom
by
contract
and
that
such
contracts
if
they
are
really
voluntary
and
not
obtained
by
fraud
or
force
and
if
they
do
not
violate
the
freedom
of
others
are
to
be
enforced
by
legal
penalties
but
i
can
not
see
that
enforcement
of
contracts
is
strictly
included
in
the
notion
of
realising
freedom
for
a
man
seems
to
be
most
completely
free
when
no
one
of
his
volitions
is
allowed
to
have
any
effect
in
causing
the
coercion
of
any
other
if
again
this
right
of
limiting
freedom
is
itself
unlimited
a
man
might
thus
freely
contract
himself
out
of
freedom
into
slavery
so
that
the
principle
of
freedom
would
turn
out
suicidal
and
yet
to
deduce
from
this
principle
a
limited
right
of
limiting
freedom
by
contract
seems
clearly
impossible
but
if
it
be
difficult
to
define
freedom
as
an
ideal
to
be
realised
in
the
merely
personal
relations
of
human
beings
the
difficulty
is
increased
when
we
consider
the
relation
of
men
to
the
material
means
of
life
and
happiness
for
it
is
commonly
thought
that
the
individual
s
right
to
freedom
includes
the
right
of
appropriating
material
things
but
if
freedom
be
understood
strictly
i
do
not
see
that
it
implies
more
than
his
right
to
while
actually
using
such
things
as
can
only
be
used
by
one
person
at
once
the
right
to
prevent
others
from
using
at
any
future
time
anything
that
an
individual
has
once
seized
seems
an
interference
with
the
free
action
of
others
beyond
what
is
needed
to
secure
the
freedom
strictly
speaking
of
the
appropriator
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
a
man
in
appropriating
a
particular
thing
does
not
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
others
because
the
rest
of
the
world
is
still
open
to
them
but
others
may
want
just
what
he
has
appropriated
and
they
may
not
be
able
to
find
anything
so
good
at
all
or
at
least
without
much
labour
and
search
for
many
of
the
instruments
and
materials
of
comfortable
living
are
limited
in
quantity
this
argument
applies
especially
to
property
in
land
and
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
this
case
there
is
a
further
difficulty
in
determining
how
much
a
man
is
to
be
allowed
to
appropriate
by
first
if
it
be
said
that
a
man
is
to
be
understood
to
occupy
what
he
is
able
to
use
the
answer
is
obvious
that
the
use
of
land
by
any
individual
may
vary
almost
indefinitely
in
extent
while
diminishing
proportionally
in
intensity
for
instance
it
would
surely
be
a
paradoxical
deduction
from
the
principle
of
freedom
to
maintain
that
an
individual
had
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
pasturing
sheep
on
any
part
of
the
land
over
which
his
hunting
expeditions
could
extend
but
if
so
can
it
be
clear
that
a
shepherd
has
such
a
right
against
one
who
wishes
to
till
the
land
or
that
one
who
is
using
the
surface
has
a
right
to
exclude
a
miner
i
do
not
see
how
the
deduction
is
to
be
made
out
again
it
may
be
disputed
whether
the
right
of
property
as
thus
derived
is
to
include
the
right
of
controlling
the
disposal
of
one
s
possessions
after
death
for
this
to
most
persons
seems
naturally
bound
up
with
ownership
yet
it
is
paradoxical
to
say
that
we
interfere
with
a
man
s
freedom
of
action
by
anything
that
we
may
do
after
his
death
to
what
he
owned
during
his
life
and
jurists
have
often
treated
this
right
as
purely
conventional
and
not
therefore
included
in
natural
other
difficulties
might
be
raised
but
we
need
not
pursue
them
for
if
freedom
be
taken
simply
to
mean
that
one
man
s
actions
are
to
be
as
little
as
possible
restrained
by
others
it
is
obviously
more
fully
realised
without
appropriation
and
if
it
be
said
that
it
includes
beside
this
facility
and
security
in
the
gratification
of
desires
and
that
it
is
freedom
in
this
sense
that
we
think
should
be
equally
distributed
and
that
this
can
not
be
realised
without
appropriation
then
it
may
be
replied
that
in
a
society
where
nearly
all
material
things
are
already
appropriated
this
kind
of
freedom
is
not
and
can
not
be
equally
distributed
a
man
born
into
such
a
society
without
inheritance
is
not
only
far
less
free
than
those
who
possess
property
but
he
is
less
free
than
if
there
had
been
no
appropriation
it
may
be
said
that
having
freedom
of
contract
he
will
give
his
services
in
exchange
for
the
means
of
satisfying
his
wants
and
that
this
exchange
must
necessarily
give
him
more
than
he
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
placed
in
the
world
by
himself
that
in
fact
any
human
society
always
renders
the
part
of
the
earth
that
it
inhabits
more
capable
of
affording
gratification
of
desires
to
each
and
all
of
its
members
than
it
would
otherwise
be
but
however
true
this
may
be
as
a
general
rule
it
is
obviously
not
so
in
all
cases
as
men
are
sometimes
unable
to
sell
their
services
at
all
and
often
can
only
obtain
in
exchange
for
them
an
insufficient
subsistence
and
even
granting
it
to
be
true
it
does
not
prove
that
society
by
appropriation
has
not
interfered
with
the
natural
freedom
of
its
poorer
members
but
only
that
it
compensates
them
for
such
interference
and
that
the
compensation
is
adequate
and
it
must
be
evident
that
if
compensation
in
the
form
of
material
commodities
can
be
justly
given
for
an
encroachment
on
freedom
the
realisation
of
freedom
can
not
be
the
one
ultimate
end
of
distributive
justice
it
seems
then
that
though
freedom
is
an
object
of
keen
and
general
desire
and
an
important
source
of
happiness
both
in
itself
and
indirectly
from
the
satisfaction
of
natural
impulses
which
it
allows
the
attempt
to
make
it
the
fundamental
notion
of
theoretical
jurisprudence
is
attended
with
insuperable
difficulties
and
that
even
the
natural
rights
which
it
claims
to
cover
can
not
be
brought
under
it
except
in
a
very
forced
and
arbitrary
manner
but
further
even
if
this
were
otherwise
an
equal
distribution
of
freedom
does
not
seem
to
exhaust
our
notion
of
justice
ideal
justice
as
we
commonly
conceive
it
seems
to
demand
that
not
only
freedom
but
all
other
benefits
and
burdens
should
be
distributed
if
not
equally
at
any
rate
justly
justice
in
distribution
being
regarded
as
not
identical
with
equality
but
merely
exclusive
of
arbitrary
inequality
how
then
shall
we
find
the
principle
of
this
highest
and
most
comprehensive
ideal
we
shall
be
led
to
it
i
think
by
referring
again
to
one
of
the
grounds
of
obligation
to
render
services
which
was
noticed
in
the
last
chapter
the
claim
of
gratitude
it
there
appeared
that
we
have
not
only
a
natural
impulse
to
requite
benefits
but
also
a
conviction
that
such
requital
is
a
duty
and
its
omission
blameworthy
to
some
extent
at
least
though
we
find
it
difficult
to
define
the
extent
now
it
seems
that
when
we
so
to
say
this
impulse
and
conviction
we
get
the
element
in
the
common
view
of
justice
which
we
are
now
trying
to
define
for
if
we
take
the
proposition
that
good
done
to
any
individual
ought
to
be
requited
by
him
and
leave
out
the
relation
to
the
individual
in
either
term
of
the
proposition
we
seem
to
have
an
equally
strong
conviction
of
the
truth
of
the
more
general
statement
that
good
deeds
ought
to
be
and
if
we
take
into
consideration
all
the
different
kinds
and
degrees
of
services
upon
the
mutual
exchange
of
which
society
is
based
we
get
the
proposition
that
men
ought
to
be
rewarded
in
proportion
to
their
and
this
would
be
commonly
held
to
be
the
true
and
simple
principle
of
distribution
in
any
case
where
there
are
no
claims
arising
from
contract
or
custom
to
modify
its
operation
for
example
it
would
be
admitted
that
if
there
has
been
no
previous
arrangement
the
profits
of
any
work
or
enterprise
should
be
divided
among
those
who
have
contributed
to
its
success
in
proportion
to
the
worth
of
their
services
and
it
may
be
observed
that
some
thinkers
maintain
the
proposition
discussed
in
the
previous
section
that
law
ought
to
aim
at
securing
the
greatest
possible
freedom
for
each
individual
not
as
absolute
and
axiomatic
but
as
derivative
from
the
principle
that
desert
ought
to
be
requited
on
the
ground
that
the
best
way
of
providing
for
the
requital
of
desert
is
to
leave
men
as
free
as
possible
to
exert
themselves
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
own
desires
and
so
to
win
each
his
own
requital
and
this
seems
to
be
really
the
principle
upon
which
the
right
of
property
is
rested
when
it
is
justified
by
the
proposition
that
every
one
has
an
exclusive
right
to
the
produce
of
his
for
on
reflection
it
is
seen
that
no
labour
really
produces
any
material
thing
but
only
adds
to
its
value
and
we
do
not
think
that
a
man
can
acquire
a
right
to
a
material
thing
belonging
to
another
by
spending
his
labour
on
it
even
if
he
does
so
in
the
belief
that
it
is
his
own
property
but
only
to
adequate
for
his
labour
this
therefore
is
what
the
proposition
just
quoted
must
mean
the
principle
is
indeed
sometimes
stretched
to
explain
the
original
right
of
property
in
materials
as
being
in
a
sense
produced
found
by
their
first
discoverer
but
here
again
reflection
shows
that
common
sense
does
not
grant
this
as
a
right
absolutely
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
appears
to
be
not
more
than
adequate
compensation
for
the
discoverer
s
trouble
for
example
we
should
not
consider
that
the
first
finder
of
a
large
uninhabited
region
had
a
moral
right
to
appropriate
the
whole
of
it
hence
this
justification
of
the
right
of
property
refers
us
ultimately
to
the
principle
that
every
man
ought
to
receive
adequate
requital
for
his
so
again
when
we
speak
of
the
world
as
justly
governed
by
god
we
seem
to
mean
that
if
we
could
know
the
whole
of
human
existence
we
should
find
that
happiness
is
distributed
among
men
according
to
their
deserts
and
divine
justice
is
thought
to
be
a
pattern
which
human
justice
is
to
imitate
as
far
as
the
conditions
of
human
society
allow
this
kind
of
justice
as
has
been
said
seems
like
gratitude
universalised
and
the
same
principle
applied
to
punishment
may
similarly
be
regarded
as
resentment
universalised
though
the
parallel
is
incomplete
if
we
are
considering
the
present
state
of
our
moral
conceptions
history
shows
us
a
time
in
which
it
was
thought
not
only
as
natural
but
as
clearly
right
and
incumbent
on
a
man
to
requite
injuries
as
to
repay
benefits
but
as
moral
reflection
developed
in
europe
this
notion
was
repudiated
so
that
plato
taught
that
it
could
never
be
right
really
to
harm
any
one
however
he
may
have
harmed
us
and
this
is
the
accepted
doctrine
in
christian
societies
as
regards
requital
by
individuals
of
personal
wrongs
but
in
its
universalised
form
the
old
conviction
still
lingers
in
the
popular
view
of
criminal
justice
it
seems
still
to
be
widely
held
that
justice
requires
pain
to
be
inflicted
on
a
man
who
has
done
wrong
even
if
no
benefit
result
either
to
him
or
to
others
from
the
pain
personally
i
am
so
far
from
holding
this
view
that
i
have
an
instinctive
and
strong
moral
aversion
to
it
and
i
hesitate
to
attribute
it
to
common
sense
since
i
think
that
it
is
gradually
passing
away
from
the
moral
consciousness
of
educated
persons
in
the
most
advanced
communities
but
i
think
it
is
still
perhaps
the
more
ordinary
view
this
then
is
one
element
of
what
aristotle
calls
corrective
justice
which
is
embodied
in
criminal
law
it
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
principle
of
reparation
on
which
legal
awards
of
damages
are
based
we
have
already
noticed
this
as
a
simple
deduction
from
the
maxim
of
general
benevolence
which
forbids
us
to
do
harm
to
our
for
if
we
have
harmed
them
we
can
yet
approximately
obey
the
maxim
by
giving
compensation
for
the
harm
though
here
the
question
arises
whether
we
are
bound
to
make
reparation
for
harm
that
has
been
quite
blamelessly
caused
and
it
is
not
easy
to
answer
it
decisively
on
the
whole
i
think
we
should
condemn
a
man
who
did
not
offer
some
reparation
for
any
serious
injury
caused
by
him
to
another
even
if
quite
involuntarily
caused
and
without
negligence
but
perhaps
we
regard
this
rather
as
a
duty
of
benevolence
arising
out
of
the
general
sympathy
that
each
ought
to
have
for
others
intensified
by
this
special
occasion
than
as
a
duty
of
strict
justice
if
however
we
limit
the
requirement
of
reparation
under
the
head
of
strict
justice
to
cases
in
which
the
mischief
repaired
is
due
to
acts
or
omissions
in
some
degree
culpable
a
difficulty
arises
from
the
divergence
between
the
moral
view
of
culpability
and
that
which
social
security
requires
of
this
i
will
speak
presently
in
any
case
there
is
now
no
danger
of
confusion
or
collision
between
the
principle
of
reparative
and
that
of
retributive
justice
as
the
one
is
manifestly
concerned
with
the
claims
of
the
injured
party
and
the
other
with
the
deserts
of
the
wrongdoer
though
in
the
actual
administration
of
law
the
obligation
of
paying
compensation
for
wrong
may
sometimes
be
treated
as
a
sufficient
punishment
for
the
wrongdoer
when
however
we
turn
again
to
the
other
branch
of
retributive
justice
which
is
concerned
with
the
reward
of
services
we
find
another
notion
which
i
will
call
fitness
often
blended
indistinguishably
with
the
notion
of
desert
and
so
needing
to
be
carefully
separated
from
it
and
when
the
distinction
has
been
made
we
see
that
the
two
are
liable
to
come
into
collision
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
the
principle
of
distribution
according
to
fitness
is
found
strictly
speaking
in
the
analysis
of
the
ordinary
notion
of
justice
but
it
certainly
enters
into
our
common
conception
of
the
ideal
or
perfectly
rational
order
of
society
as
regards
the
distribution
both
of
instruments
and
functions
and
to
some
extent
at
least
of
other
sources
of
happiness
we
certainly
think
it
reasonable
that
instruments
should
be
given
to
those
who
can
use
them
best
and
functions
allotted
to
those
who
are
most
competent
to
perform
them
but
these
may
not
be
those
who
have
rendered
most
services
in
the
past
and
again
we
think
it
reasonable
that
particular
material
means
of
enjoyment
should
fall
to
the
lot
of
those
who
are
susceptible
of
the
respective
kinds
of
pleasure
as
no
one
would
think
of
allotting
pictures
to
a
blind
man
or
rare
wines
to
one
who
had
no
taste
hence
we
should
probably
think
it
fitting
that
artists
should
have
larger
shares
than
mechanics
in
the
social
distribution
of
wealth
though
they
may
be
by
no
means
more
deserving
thus
the
notions
of
desert
and
fitness
appear
at
least
occasionally
conflicting
but
perhaps
as
i
have
suggested
fitness
should
rather
be
regarded
as
a
utilitarian
principle
of
distribution
inevitably
limiting
the
realisation
of
what
is
abstractly
just
than
as
a
part
of
the
interpretation
of
justice
proper
and
it
is
with
the
latter
that
we
are
at
present
concerned
at
any
rate
it
is
the
requital
of
desert
that
constitutes
the
chief
element
of
ideal
justice
in
so
far
as
this
imports
something
more
than
mere
equality
and
impartiality
let
us
then
examine
more
closely
wherein
desert
consists
and
we
will
begin
with
good
desert
or
merit
as
being
of
the
most
fundamental
and
permanent
importance
for
we
may
hope
that
crime
and
its
punishment
will
decrease
and
gradually
disappear
as
the
world
improves
but
the
right
or
best
distribution
of
the
means
of
wellbeing
is
an
object
that
we
must
always
be
striving
to
realise
and
first
the
question
which
we
had
to
consider
in
defining
gratitude
again
recurs
whether
namely
we
are
to
apportion
the
reward
to
the
effort
made
or
to
the
results
attained
for
it
may
be
said
that
the
actual
utility
of
any
service
must
depend
much
upon
favourable
circumstances
and
fortunate
accidents
not
due
to
any
desert
of
the
agent
or
again
may
be
due
to
powers
and
skills
which
were
connate
or
have
been
developed
by
favourable
conditions
of
life
or
by
good
education
and
why
should
we
reward
him
for
these
for
the
we
ought
rather
to
reward
those
who
have
educated
him
and
certainly
it
is
only
in
so
far
as
excellences
are
exhibited
in
human
achievements
that
they
are
commonly
thought
to
be
such
as
god
will
reward
but
by
drawing
this
line
we
do
not
yet
get
rid
of
the
difficulty
for
it
may
still
be
said
that
good
actions
are
due
entirely
or
to
a
great
extent
to
good
dispositions
and
habits
and
that
these
are
partly
inherited
and
partly
due
to
the
care
of
parents
and
teachers
so
that
in
rewarding
these
we
are
rewarding
the
results
of
natural
and
accidental
advantages
and
it
is
unreasonable
to
distinguish
these
from
others
such
as
skill
and
knowledge
and
to
say
that
it
is
even
ideally
just
to
reward
the
one
and
not
the
other
shall
we
say
then
that
the
reward
should
be
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
voluntary
effort
for
a
good
end
but
determinists
will
say
that
even
this
is
ultimately
the
effect
of
causes
extraneous
to
the
man
s
self
on
the
determinist
view
then
it
would
seem
to
be
ideally
just
if
anything
is
so
that
all
men
should
enjoy
equal
amounts
of
happiness
for
there
seems
to
be
no
justice
in
making
happier
than
merely
because
circumstances
beyond
his
own
control
have
first
made
him
better
but
why
should
we
not
instead
of
all
men
say
all
sentient
beings
for
why
should
men
have
more
happiness
than
any
other
animal
but
thus
the
pursuit
of
ideal
justice
seems
to
conduct
us
to
such
a
precipice
of
paradox
that
common
sense
is
likely
to
abandon
it
at
any
rate
the
ordinary
idea
of
desert
has
thus
altogether
vanished
and
thus
we
seem
to
be
led
to
the
conclusion
which
i
anticipated
in
book
chap
that
in
this
one
department
of
our
moral
consciousness
the
idea
of
free
will
seems
involved
in
a
peculiar
way
in
the
moral
ideas
of
common
sense
since
if
it
is
eliminated
the
important
notions
of
desert
or
merit
and
justice
require
material
modification
at
the
same
time
the
difference
between
determinist
and
libertarian
justice
can
hardly
have
any
practical
effect
for
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
separate
in
practice
that
part
of
a
man
s
achievement
which
is
due
strictly
to
his
free
choice
from
that
part
which
is
due
to
the
original
gift
of
nature
and
to
favouring
circumstances
so
that
we
must
necessarily
leave
to
providence
the
realisation
of
what
we
conceive
as
the
theoretical
ideal
of
justice
and
content
ourselves
with
trying
to
reward
voluntary
actions
in
proportion
to
the
worth
of
the
services
intentionally
rendered
by
them
if
then
we
take
as
the
principle
of
ideal
justice
so
far
as
this
can
be
practically
aimed
at
in
human
society
the
requital
of
voluntary
services
in
proportion
to
their
worth
it
remains
to
consider
on
what
principle
or
principles
the
comparative
worth
of
different
services
is
to
be
rationally
estimated
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
commonly
assume
such
an
estimate
to
be
possible
for
we
continually
speak
of
the
fair
or
proper
price
of
any
kind
of
services
as
something
generally
known
and
condemn
the
demand
for
more
than
this
as
extortionate
it
may
be
said
that
the
notion
of
fairness
or
equity
which
we
ordinarily
apply
in
such
judgments
is
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
justice
equity
being
in
fact
often
contrasted
with
strict
justice
and
conceived
as
capable
of
coming
into
collision
with
it
and
this
is
partly
true
but
i
think
the
wider
and
no
less
usual
sense
of
the
term
justice
in
which
it
includes
equity
or
fairness
is
the
only
one
that
can
be
conveniently
adopted
in
an
ethical
treatise
for
in
any
case
where
equity
comes
into
conflict
with
strict
justice
its
dictates
are
held
to
be
in
a
higher
sense
just
and
what
ought
to
be
ultimately
carried
into
effect
in
the
case
considered
though
not
perhaps
by
the
administrators
of
law
i
treat
equity
therefore
as
a
species
of
justice
though
noting
that
the
former
term
is
more
ordinarily
used
in
cases
where
the
definiteness
attainable
is
recognised
as
somewhat
less
than
in
ordinary
cases
of
rightful
claims
arising
out
of
law
or
contract
on
what
principle
then
can
we
determine
the
fair
or
equitable
price
of
services
when
we
examine
the
common
judgments
of
practical
persons
in
which
this
judgment
occurs
we
find
i
think
that
the
fair
in
such
cases
is
ascertained
by
a
reference
to
analogy
and
custom
and
that
any
service
is
considered
to
be
fairly
worth
what
is
usually
given
for
services
of
the
kind
hence
this
element
of
the
notion
of
justice
may
seem
after
all
to
resolve
itself
into
that
discussed
in
and
in
some
states
of
society
it
certainly
appears
that
the
payment
to
be
given
for
services
is
as
completely
fixed
by
usage
as
any
other
customary
duty
so
that
it
would
be
a
clear
disappointment
of
normal
expectation
to
deviate
from
this
usage
but
probably
no
one
in
a
modern
civilised
community
would
maintain
in
its
full
breadth
this
identification
of
the
just
with
the
usual
price
of
services
and
so
far
as
the
judgments
of
practical
persons
may
seem
to
imply
this
i
think
it
must
be
admitted
that
they
are
superficial
or
merely
inadvertent
and
ignore
the
established
mode
of
determining
the
market
prices
of
commodities
by
free
competition
of
producers
and
traders
for
where
such
competition
operates
the
market
value
rises
and
falls
and
is
different
at
different
places
and
times
so
that
no
properly
instructed
person
can
expect
any
fixity
in
it
or
complain
of
injustice
merely
on
account
of
the
variations
in
it
can
we
then
say
that
market
value
as
determined
by
free
competition
corresponds
to
our
notion
of
what
is
ideally
just
this
is
a
question
of
much
interest
because
this
is
obviously
the
mode
of
determining
the
remuneration
of
services
that
would
be
universal
in
a
society
constructed
on
the
principle
previously
discussed
of
securing
the
greatest
possible
freedom
to
all
members
of
the
community
it
should
be
observed
that
this
which
we
may
call
the
individualistic
ideal
is
the
type
to
which
modern
civilised
communities
have
until
lately
been
tending
to
approximate
and
it
is
therefore
very
important
to
know
whether
it
is
one
which
completely
satisfies
the
demands
of
morality
and
whether
freedom
if
not
an
absolute
end
or
first
principle
of
abstract
justice
is
still
to
be
sought
as
the
best
means
to
the
realisation
of
a
just
social
order
by
the
general
requital
of
desert
at
first
sight
it
seems
plausible
to
urge
that
the
market
value
represents
the
estimate
set
upon
anything
by
mankind
generally
and
therefore
gives
us
exactly
that
common
sense
judgment
respecting
value
which
we
are
now
trying
to
find
but
on
examination
it
seems
likely
that
the
majority
of
men
are
not
properly
qualified
to
decide
on
the
value
of
many
important
kinds
of
services
from
imperfect
knowledge
of
their
nature
and
effects
so
that
as
far
as
these
are
concerned
the
true
judgment
will
not
be
represented
in
the
even
in
the
case
of
things
which
a
man
is
generally
able
to
estimate
it
may
be
manifest
in
a
particular
case
that
he
is
ignorant
of
the
real
utility
of
what
he
exchanges
and
in
this
case
the
free
contract
hardly
seems
to
be
fair
though
if
the
ignorance
was
not
caused
by
the
other
party
to
the
exchange
common
sense
is
hardly
prepared
to
condemn
the
latter
as
unjust
for
taking
advantage
of
it
for
instance
if
a
man
has
discovered
by
a
legitimate
use
of
geological
knowledge
and
skill
that
there
is
probably
a
valuable
mine
on
land
owned
by
a
stranger
reasonable
persons
would
not
blame
him
for
concealing
his
discovery
until
he
had
bought
the
mine
at
its
market
value
yet
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
seller
got
what
it
was
really
worth
in
fact
common
sense
is
rather
perplexed
on
this
point
and
the
of
the
conclusion
at
which
it
arrives
must
i
conceive
be
sought
in
economic
considerations
which
take
us
quite
beyond
the
analysis
of
the
common
notion
of
justice
again
there
are
social
services
recognised
as
highly
important
which
generally
speaking
have
no
price
in
any
market
on
account
of
the
indirectness
and
uncertainty
of
their
practical
utility
as
for
instance
scientific
discoveries
the
extent
to
which
any
given
discovery
will
aid
industrial
invention
is
so
uncertain
that
even
if
the
secret
of
it
could
be
conveniently
kept
it
would
not
usually
be
profitable
to
buy
it
but
even
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
products
and
services
generally
marketable
and
to
bargains
thoroughly
understood
on
both
sides
there
are
still
serious
difficulties
in
the
way
of
identifying
the
notions
of
free
and
fair
exchange
thus
where
an
individual
or
combination
of
individuals
has
the
monopoly
of
a
certain
kind
of
services
the
of
the
aggregate
of
such
services
can
under
certain
conditions
be
increased
by
diminishing
their
total
amount
but
it
would
seem
absurd
to
say
that
the
social
desert
of
those
rendering
the
services
is
thereby
increased
and
a
plain
man
has
grave
doubts
whether
the
price
thus
attained
is
fair
still
less
is
it
thought
fair
to
take
advantage
of
the
transient
monopoly
produced
by
emergency
thus
if
i
saw
crœsus
drowning
and
no
one
near
it
would
not
be
held
fair
in
me
to
refuse
to
save
him
except
at
the
price
of
half
his
wealth
but
if
so
can
it
be
fair
for
any
class
of
persons
to
gain
competitively
by
the
unfavourable
economic
situation
of
another
class
with
which
they
deal
and
if
we
admit
that
it
would
be
unfair
where
are
we
to
draw
the
line
for
any
increase
of
the
numbers
of
a
class
renders
its
situation
for
bargaining
less
favourable
since
the
market
price
of
different
services
depends
partly
upon
the
ease
or
difficulty
of
procuring
them
as
political
economists
say
on
the
relation
between
the
supply
of
services
and
the
demand
for
them
and
it
does
not
seem
that
any
individual
s
social
desert
can
properly
be
lessened
merely
by
the
increased
number
or
willingness
of
others
rendering
the
same
services
nor
indeed
does
it
seem
that
it
can
be
decreased
by
his
own
willingness
for
it
is
strange
to
reward
a
man
less
because
he
is
zealous
and
eager
in
the
performance
of
his
function
yet
in
bargaining
the
less
willing
always
has
the
advantage
and
finally
it
hardly
appears
that
the
social
worth
of
a
man
s
service
is
necessarily
increased
by
the
fact
that
his
service
is
rendered
to
those
who
can
pay
lavishly
but
his
reward
is
certainly
likely
to
be
greater
from
this
cause
such
considerations
as
these
have
led
some
political
thinkers
to
hold
that
justice
requires
a
mode
of
distributing
payment
for
services
entirely
different
from
that
at
present
effected
by
free
competition
and
that
all
labourers
ought
to
be
paid
according
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
their
labour
as
estimated
by
enlightened
and
competent
judges
if
the
socialistic
ideal
as
we
may
perhaps
call
it
could
be
realised
without
evils
it
would
certainly
seem
to
give
a
nearer
approximation
to
what
we
conceive
as
divine
justice
than
the
present
state
of
society
affords
but
this
supposes
that
we
have
found
the
rational
method
of
determining
value
which
however
is
still
to
seek
shall
we
say
that
these
judges
are
to
take
the
value
of
a
service
as
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
happiness
produced
by
it
if
so
the
calculation
is
of
course
exposed
to
all
the
difficulties
of
the
hedonistic
method
discussed
in
book
ii
but
supposing
these
can
be
overcome
it
is
still
hard
to
say
how
we
are
to
compare
the
value
of
different
services
that
must
necessarily
be
combined
to
produce
happy
life
for
example
how
shall
we
compare
the
respective
values
of
necessaries
and
luxuries
for
we
may
be
more
sensible
of
the
enjoyment
derived
from
the
latter
but
we
could
not
have
this
at
all
without
the
former
and
again
when
different
kinds
of
labour
in
the
same
production
how
are
we
to
estimate
their
relative
values
for
even
if
all
mere
unskilled
labour
may
be
brought
to
a
common
standard
this
seems
almost
impossible
in
the
case
of
different
kinds
of
skill
for
how
shall
we
compare
the
labour
of
design
with
that
of
achievement
or
the
supervision
of
the
whole
with
the
execution
of
details
or
the
labour
of
actually
producing
with
that
of
educating
producers
or
the
service
of
the
who
discovers
a
new
principle
with
that
of
the
inventor
who
applies
it
i
do
not
see
how
these
questions
or
the
difficulties
noticed
in
the
preceding
paragraph
can
be
met
by
any
analysis
of
our
common
notion
of
justice
to
deal
with
such
points
at
all
satisfactorily
we
have
i
conceive
to
adopt
quite
a
different
line
of
reasoning
we
have
to
ask
not
what
services
of
a
certain
kind
are
intrinsically
worth
but
what
reward
can
procure
them
and
whether
the
rest
of
society
gain
by
the
services
more
than
the
equivalent
reward
we
have
in
short
to
give
up
as
impracticable
the
construction
of
an
ideally
just
social
order
in
which
all
services
are
rewarded
in
exact
proportion
to
their
intrinsic
value
and
for
similar
reasons
we
seem
forced
to
conclude
more
generally
that
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
clear
premises
for
a
reasoned
method
of
determining
exactly
different
amounts
of
good
desert
indeed
perhaps
common
sense
scarcely
holds
such
a
method
to
be
possible
for
though
it
considers
ideal
justice
to
consist
in
rewarding
desert
it
regards
as
utopian
any
general
attempt
to
realise
this
ideal
in
the
social
distribution
of
the
means
of
happiness
in
the
actual
state
of
society
it
is
only
within
a
very
limited
range
that
any
endeavour
is
made
to
reward
good
desert
parents
attempt
this
to
some
extent
in
dealing
with
their
children
and
the
state
in
rewarding
remarkable
public
services
rendered
by
statesmen
soldiers
etc
but
reflection
on
these
cases
will
show
how
very
rough
and
imperfect
are
the
standards
used
in
deciding
the
amount
due
and
ordinarily
the
only
kind
of
justice
which
we
try
to
realise
is
that
which
consists
in
the
fulfilment
of
contracts
and
definite
expectations
leaving
the
general
fairness
of
distribution
by
bargaining
to
take
care
of
itself
when
we
pass
to
consider
the
case
of
criminal
justice
we
find
in
the
first
place
difficulties
corresponding
to
those
which
we
have
already
noticed
we
find
to
begin
a
similar
implication
and
partial
confusion
of
the
ideas
of
law
and
justice
for
as
was
said
by
bringing
a
man
to
justice
we
commonly
mean
inflicting
legal
punishment
on
him
and
we
think
it
right
that
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
penalty
prescribed
by
law
should
be
executed
even
though
we
may
regard
the
legal
scale
of
punishment
as
unjust
at
the
same
time
we
have
no
such
perplexity
in
respect
of
changes
in
the
law
as
occurs
in
the
case
of
civil
justice
for
we
do
not
think
that
a
man
can
acquire
by
custom
prescriptive
rights
to
punishment
as
he
is
thought
to
do
to
an
unequal
distribution
of
liberties
and
privileges
if
now
we
investigate
the
ideal
of
criminal
justice
as
intuitively
determined
we
certainly
find
that
in
so
far
as
punishment
is
not
regarded
as
merely
preventive
it
is
commonly
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
proportioned
to
the
gravity
of
crime
still
when
we
endeavour
to
make
the
method
of
apportionment
perfectly
rational
and
precise
the
difficulties
seem
at
least
as
great
as
in
the
case
of
good
desert
for
first
the
assumption
of
free
will
seems
necessarily
to
come
in
here
also
since
if
a
man
s
bad
deeds
are
entirely
caused
by
nature
and
circumstances
it
certainly
appears
as
robert
owen
urged
that
he
does
not
properly
deserve
to
be
punished
for
them
justice
would
rather
seem
to
require
us
to
try
to
alter
the
conditions
under
which
he
acts
and
we
actually
do
punish
deliberate
offences
more
than
impulsive
perhaps
as
implying
a
more
free
choice
of
evil
again
we
think
that
offences
committed
by
persons
who
have
had
no
moral
training
or
a
perverted
training
are
really
less
criminal
at
the
same
time
it
is
commonly
agreed
that
men
can
hardly
remit
punishment
on
this
account
again
the
gravity
from
a
moral
point
of
view
of
a
crime
seems
to
be
at
least
much
reduced
if
the
motive
be
laudable
as
when
a
man
kills
a
villain
whose
crimes
elude
legal
punishment
or
heads
a
hopeless
rebellion
for
the
good
of
his
country
still
it
would
be
paradoxical
to
affirm
that
we
ought
to
reduce
punishment
proportionally
common
sense
would
hold
that
whatever
god
may
do
men
must
generally
speaking
inflict
severe
punishment
for
any
gravely
mischievous
act
forbidden
by
law
which
has
been
intentionally
done
even
though
it
may
have
been
prompted
by
a
good
motive
but
even
if
we
neglect
the
motive
and
take
the
intention
only
into
account
it
is
not
easy
to
state
clear
principles
for
determining
the
gravity
of
crimes
for
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
the
patriotic
rebel
the
intention
of
the
criminal
is
to
do
what
is
right
and
good
and
in
many
cases
though
he
knows
that
he
is
doing
wrong
he
does
not
intend
to
cause
any
actual
harm
to
any
sentient
being
as
when
a
thief
takes
what
he
thinks
will
not
be
missed
again
we
do
not
commonly
think
that
a
crime
is
rendered
less
grave
by
being
kept
perfectly
secret
and
yet
a
great
part
of
the
harm
done
by
a
crime
is
the
secondary
evil
as
bentham
calls
it
of
the
alarm
and
insecurity
which
it
causes
and
this
part
is
cut
off
by
complete
secrecy
it
may
be
replied
that
this
latter
difficulty
is
not
a
practical
one
because
we
are
not
called
upon
to
punish
a
crime
until
it
has
been
discovered
and
then
the
secondary
evil
has
been
caused
and
is
all
the
greater
because
of
the
previous
secrecy
but
it
remains
true
that
it
was
not
designed
for
discovery
and
therefore
that
this
part
of
the
evil
caused
by
the
crime
was
not
intended
by
the
criminal
and
if
we
say
that
the
heinousness
of
the
crime
depends
on
the
loss
of
happiness
that
would
generally
be
caused
by
such
acts
if
they
were
allowed
to
go
unpunished
and
that
we
must
suppose
the
criminal
to
be
aware
of
this
we
seem
to
be
endeavouring
to
force
a
utilitarian
theory
into
an
intuitional
form
by
means
of
a
legal
fiction
we
have
hitherto
spoken
of
intentional
but
positive
law
awards
punishment
also
for
harm
that
is
due
to
rashness
or
negligence
and
the
justification
of
this
involves
us
in
further
difficulties
some
jurists
seem
to
regard
rashness
and
negligence
as
positive
states
of
mind
in
which
the
agent
consciously
refuses
the
attention
or
reflection
which
he
knows
he
ought
to
give
and
no
doubt
this
sort
of
wilful
recklessness
does
sometimes
occur
and
seems
as
properly
punishable
as
if
the
resulting
harm
had
been
positively
intended
but
the
law
as
actually
administered
does
not
require
evidence
that
this
was
the
agent
s
state
of
mind
which
indeed
in
most
cases
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
but
is
content
with
proof
that
the
harm
might
have
been
prevented
by
such
care
as
an
average
man
would
have
shown
under
the
circumstances
and
most
commonly
by
carelessness
we
simply
mean
a
purely
negative
psychological
fact
that
the
agent
did
not
perform
certain
processes
of
observation
or
reflection
it
is
therefore
at
the
time
strictly
involuntary
and
so
scarcely
seems
to
involve
it
may
be
said
perhaps
that
though
the
present
carelessness
is
not
blameworthy
the
past
neglect
to
cultivate
habits
of
care
is
so
but
in
many
individual
instances
we
can
not
reasonably
infer
even
this
past
neglect
and
in
such
cases
the
utilitarian
theory
of
punishment
which
regards
it
as
a
means
of
preventing
similar
harmful
acts
in
the
future
seems
alone
applicable
similar
difficulties
arise
as
was
before
hinted
in
determining
the
limits
within
which
reparation
is
due
that
is
on
the
view
that
it
is
not
incumbent
on
us
to
make
compensation
for
all
harm
caused
by
our
muscular
actions
but
only
for
harm
which
if
not
intentional
was
due
to
our
rashness
or
negligence
the
results
of
this
examination
of
justice
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
the
prominent
element
in
justice
as
ordinarily
conceived
is
a
kind
of
equality
that
is
impartiality
in
the
observance
or
enforcement
of
certain
general
rules
allotting
good
or
evil
to
individuals
but
when
we
have
clearly
distinguished
this
element
we
see
that
the
definition
of
the
virtue
required
for
practical
guidance
is
left
obviously
incomplete
inquiring
further
for
the
right
general
principles
of
distribution
we
find
that
our
common
notion
of
justice
includes
besides
the
principle
of
reparation
for
injury
two
quite
distinct
and
divergent
elements
the
one
which
we
may
call
conservative
justice
is
realised
in
the
observance
of
law
and
contracts
and
definite
understandings
and
in
the
enforcement
of
such
penalties
for
the
violation
of
these
as
have
been
legally
determined
and
announced
and
in
the
fulfilment
of
natural
and
normal
expectations
this
latter
obligation
however
is
of
a
somewhat
indefinite
kind
but
the
other
element
which
we
have
called
ideal
justice
is
still
more
difficult
to
define
for
there
seem
to
be
two
quite
distinct
conceptions
of
it
embodied
respectively
in
what
we
have
called
the
individualistic
and
the
socialistic
ideals
of
a
political
community
the
first
of
these
takes
the
realisation
of
freedom
as
the
ultimate
end
and
standard
of
right
social
relations
but
on
examining
it
closer
we
find
that
the
notion
of
freedom
will
not
give
a
practicable
basis
for
social
construction
without
certain
arbitrary
definitions
and
limitations
and
even
if
we
admit
these
still
a
society
in
which
freedom
is
realised
as
far
as
is
feasible
does
not
completely
suit
our
sense
of
justice
this
is
more
satisfied
by
the
socialistic
ideal
of
distribution
founded
on
the
principle
of
requiting
desert
but
when
we
try
to
make
this
principle
precise
we
find
ourselves
again
involved
in
grave
difficulties
and
similar
perplexities
beset
the
working
out
of
rules
of
criminal
justice
on
the
same
principle
footnotes
how
far
an
independent
principle
of
justice
is
required
for
the
utilitarian
method
will
be
hereafter
considered
book
iv
chap
i
aristotle
in
expounding
the
virtue
of
δικαιοσύνη
which
corresponds
to
our
justice
notices
that
the
word
has
two
meanings
in
the
wider
of
which
it
includes
in
a
manner
all
virtue
or
at
any
rate
the
social
side
or
aspect
of
virtue
generally
the
word
justice
does
not
appear
to
be
used
in
english
in
this
comprehensive
manner
except
occasionally
in
religious
writings
from
the
influence
of
the
greek
word
as
used
in
the
new
testament
although
the
verb
to
justify
seems
to
have
this
width
of
meaning
for
when
i
say
that
one
is
justified
in
doing
so
and
so
i
mean
no
more
than
that
such
conduct
is
right
for
him
in
the
present
discussion
at
any
rate
i
have
confined
myself
to
the
more
precise
signification
of
the
term
i
ought
to
say
that
in
my
view
this
only
applies
to
taxes
in
the
narrower
sense
in
which
they
are
distinguished
from
payments
for
services
received
by
individuals
from
government
in
the
case
of
these
latter
i
conceive
that
justice
is
rather
held
to
lie
in
duly
proportioning
payment
to
amount
of
service
received
some
persons
have
held
that
all
payments
made
to
government
ought
to
be
determined
on
this
principle
and
this
view
seems
to
me
to
be
consistent
with
the
individualistic
ideal
of
political
order
which
i
shall
presently
examine
but
as
i
have
elsewhere
tried
to
show
of
pol
book
iii
chap
viii
there
is
an
important
department
of
governmental
expenditure
to
which
this
principle
is
not
applicable
it
may
be
well
to
notice
a
case
in
which
the
very
equality
of
application
which
is
as
has
been
said
implied
in
the
mere
idea
of
a
law
couched
in
general
terms
is
felt
to
be
unjust
this
is
the
case
where
the
words
of
a
statute
either
from
being
carelessly
drawn
or
on
account
of
the
inevitable
defects
of
even
the
most
precise
terminology
include
or
exclude
persons
and
circumstances
which
are
clearly
not
included
in
or
excluded
from
the
real
intent
and
purpose
of
the
law
in
this
case
a
particular
decision
strictly
in
accordance
with
a
law
which
generally
considered
is
just
may
cause
extreme
injustice
and
so
the
difference
between
actual
law
and
justice
is
sharply
brought
out
still
we
can
not
in
this
way
obtain
principles
for
judging
generally
of
the
justice
of
laws
it
should
be
observed
that
we
can
not
even
say
in
treating
of
the
private
conduct
of
individuals
that
arbitrary
inequality
is
recognised
as
unjust
it
would
not
be
commonly
thought
unjust
in
a
rich
bachelor
with
no
near
relatives
to
leave
the
bulk
of
his
property
in
providing
pensions
exclusively
for
indigent
men
however
unreasonable
and
capricious
the
choice
might
appear
it
may
be
observed
that
sometimes
claims
generated
in
this
way
have
legal
validity
as
when
a
right
of
way
is
established
without
express
permission
of
the
landowner
merely
by
his
continued
indulgence
this
is
the
case
even
as
i
say
when
laws
are
altered
lawfully
still
more
after
any
exceptional
crisis
at
which
there
has
occurred
a
rupture
of
political
order
for
then
the
legal
claims
arising
out
of
the
new
order
which
is
thus
rooted
in
disorder
conflict
with
those
previously
established
in
a
manner
which
admits
of
no
theoretical
solution
it
can
only
be
settled
by

it
is
characteristic
of
an
unprogressive
society
that
in
it
these
two
points
of
view
are
indistinguishable
the
jural
ideal
absolutely
coincides
with
the
customary
and
social
perfection
is
imagined
to
consist
in
the
perfect
observance
of
a
traditional
system
of
rules
this
question
how
far
the
conception
of
freedom
involves
unlimited
right
to
limit
freedom
by
free
contract
will
meet
us
again
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
consider
the
general
duty
of
obedience
to
law
it
has
often
been
urged
as
a
justification
for
expropriating
savages
from
the
land
of
new
colonies
that
tribes
of
hunters
have
really
no
moral
right
to
property
in
the
soil
over
which
they
hunt
this
is
the
argument
used
by
optimistic
political
economists
such
as
bastiat
the
further
consideration
of
political
freedom
with
which
we
shall
be
occupied
in
the
next
chapter
will
afford
additional
illustrations
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
notion
if
the
view
given
in
the
text
be
sound
it
illustrates
very
strikingly
the
difference
between
natural
instincts
and
moral
intuitions
for
the
impulse
to
requite
a
service
is
on
its
emotional
side
quite
different
from
that
which
prompts
us
to
claim
the
fruits
of
our
labour
or
a
fair
day
s
wages
for
a
fair
day
s
still
our
apprehension
of
the
of
gratitude
seems
capable
of
being
subsumed
under
the
more
general
intuition
that
desert
ought
to
be
it
certainly
requires
a
considerable
strain
to
bring
the
right
of
first
discovery
under
the
notion
of
right
to
the
produce
of
one
s
hence
locke
and
others
have
found
it
necessary
to
suppose
as
the
ultimate
justification
of
the
former
right
a
tacit
consent
of
mankind
in
general
that
all
things
previously
unappropriated
shall
belong
to
the
first
appropriator
but
this
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
rather
desperate
device
of
construction
on
account
of
the
fatal
facility
with
which
it
may
be
used
to
justify
almost
any
arbitrariness
in
positive
law
the
reader
will
find
an
interesting
illustration
of
the
perplexity
of
common
sense
on
this
point
in
holmes
junior
s
book
on
common
chap
where
the
author
gives
a
penetrating
discussion
of
the
struggle
in
the
development
of
the
doctrine
of
torts
in
english
law
between
two
opposing
views
that
the
risk
of
a
man
s
conduct
is
thrown
upon
him
as
the
result
of
some
moral
and
that
a
man
acts
at
his
peril
always
and
wholly
irrespective
of
the
state
of
his
consciousness
upon
the
the
former
is
the
view
that
has
in
the
main
prevailed
in
english
law
and
this
seems
to
me
certainly
in
harmony
with
the
common
sense
of
mankind
so
far
as
legal
liability
is
concerned
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
case
is
equally
clear
as
regards
moral
obligation
cf
pp
it
may
be
added
that
there
is
often
a
further
difficulty
in
ascertaining
the
amount
of
compensation
due
for
this
frequently
involves
a
comparison
of
things
essentially
disparate
and
there
are
some
kinds
of
harm
which
it
seems
impossible
to
compensate
in
the
earlier
stage
of
moral
development
referred
to
in
the
preceding
paragraph
retribution
inflicted
on
the
wrongdoer
was
regarded
as
the
normal
mode
of
reparation
to
the
person
injured
but
this
view
is
contrary
to
the
moral
common
sense
of
christian
societies
i
think
the
term
merit
often
blends
the
two
notions
as
when
we
speak
of
promotion
by
by
moralists
however
merit
is
generally
used
as
exactly
equivalent
to
what
i
have
called
the
only
tenable
determinist
interpretation
of
desert
is
in
my
opinion
the
utilitarian
according
to
which
when
a
man
is
said
to
deserve
reward
for
any
services
to
society
the
meaning
is
that
it
is
expedient
to
reward
him
in
order
that
he
and
others
may
be
induced
to
render
similar
services
by
the
expectation
of
similar
rewards
cf
book
iv
chap
iii
perhaps
we
may
partly
attribute
to
the
difficulties
above
discussed
that
the
notion
of
desert
has
sometimes
dropped
out
of
the
ideal
of
utopian
reconstructors
of
society
and
equality
of
happiness
has
seemed
to
be
the
only
end
justice
it
has
been
thought
prescribes
simply
that
each
should
have
an
equal
share
of
happiness
as
far
as
happiness
depends
on
the
action
of
others
but
there
seems
to
be
much
difficulty
in
working
this
out
for
apart
from
the
considerations
of
fitness
above
mentioned
equal
happiness
is
not
to
be
attained
by
equal
distribution
of
objects
of
desire
for
some
require
more
and
some
less
to
be
equally
happy
hence
it
seems
we
must
take
differences
of
into
consideration
but
if
merely
mental
needs
are
included
as
seems
reasonable
we
should
have
to
give
less
to
cheerful
contented
people
than
to
those
who
are
naturally
moody
and
as
the
former
can
be
made
happy
with
less
and
this
is
too
paradoxical
to
recommend
itself
to
common
sense
no
doubt
it
would
be
possible
to
remove
to
some
extent
the
inequalities
that
are
attributable
to
circumstances
by
bringing
the
best
education
within
the
reach
of
all
classes
so
that
all
children
might
have
an
equal
opportunity
of
being
selected
and
trained
for
any
functions
for
which
they
seemed
to
be
fit
and
this
seems
to
be
prescribed
by
ideal
justice
in
so
far
as
it
removes
or
mitigates
arbitrary
inequality
accordingly
in
those
ideal
reconstructions
of
society
in
which
we
may
expect
to
find
men
s
notions
of
abstract
justice
exhibited
such
an
institution
as
this
has
generally
found
a
place
still
there
will
be
much
natural
inequality
which
we
can
not
remove
or
even
estimate
cf
book
iv
chap
iii
it
is
not
perhaps
necessary
that
i
should
here
enlarge
on
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
any
attempt
to
realise
such
an
ideal
system
i
have
already
expressed
my
opinion
that
this
utilitarian
view
of
punishment
is
gradually
tending
to
prevail
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
yet
prevailed
of
course
those
who
hold
that
the
essence
of
justice
consists
in
securing
external
freedom
among
the
members
of
a
community
and
that
punishment
is
only
justified
as
a
means
to
this
end
naturally
think
that
in
awarding
punishment
we
ought
to
consider
merely
its
efficacy
as
such
means
but
this
can
scarcely
be
put
forward
as
an
interpretation
of
the
common
notion
of
just
punishment
by
arbitrary
i
mean
such
definitions
and
limitations
as
destroy
the
of
the
principle
and
when
closely
examined
lead
us
to
regard
it
as
subordinate
chapter
vi
laws
and
promises
in
the
discussion
of
justice
the
moral
obligations
of
obedience
to
law
and
observance
of
contract
have
been
included
and
have
indeed
appeared
to
be
the
most
definite
part
of
the
complex
system
of
private
duties
commonly
included
under
that
term
at
the
same
time
as
we
have
seen
there
are
some
laws
the
violation
of
which
does
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
others
and
therefore
has
not
the
characteristics
of
an
act
of
injustice
while
again
the
duty
of
fidelity
to
promises
is
also
commonly
conceived
as
independent
of
any
injury
that
might
be
done
to
the
promisee
by
breaking
it
for
men
ordinarily
judge
that
promises
to
the
dead
though
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
injury
ought
to
be
kept
indeed
some
would
regard
them
as
even
more
sacred
than
promises
made
to
the
living
it
seems
therefore
desirable
to
examine
the
propositions
that
law
ought
to
be
obeyed
and
that
promises
ought
to
be
kept
considered
as
independent
principles
to
begin
with
the
former
how
are
we
to
ascertain
what
the
law
is
which
as
is
commonly
thought
we
are
morally
bound
to
obey
as
such
it
is
plain
that
we
can
not
here
distinguish
legal
from
other
rules
by
considering
the
sanctions
actually
attached
to
them
as
we
had
occasion
to
do
in
a
previous
chapter
for
commands
issued
by
rebels
and
usurpers
are
held
to
have
as
such
no
general
bindingness
though
they
may
be
enforced
by
judicial
penalties
it
would
be
generally
agreed
that
so
far
as
it
is
our
duty
to
obey
such
commands
this
is
solely
in
order
to
avoid
the
greater
evils
which
might
result
to
ourselves
and
others
from
our
disobedience
and
that
the
extent
of
such
a
duty
must
be
determined
by
considerations
of
expediency
nor
again
can
we
say
that
all
commands
even
of
a
legitimate
sovereign
are
to
be
regarded
as
laws
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
must
be
taken
in
the
proposition
that
laws
ought
to
be
obeyed
since
we
all
recognise
that
a
rightful
sovereign
may
command
his
subjects
to
do
what
is
wrong
and
that
it
is
then
their
duty
to
disobey
him
it
seems
therefore
that
for
our
present
purpose
we
must
define
laws
to
be
rules
of
conduct
laid
down
by
a
rightful
authority
commanding
within
the
limits
of
its
authority
there
are
therefore
two
questions
to
be
settled
if
the
proposition
that
laws
ought
to
be
obeyed
is
to
furnish
practical
guidance
how
we
are
to
distinguish
the
rightful
lawmaker
whether
individual
or
body
and
how
we
are
to
ascertain
the
limits
of
this
lawmaker
s
authority
the
questions
should
be
distinguished
but
as
we
shall
see
they
can
only
be
partially
separated
beginning
with
the
first
question
we
may
assume
that
the
authority
to
make
laws
resides
in
some
living
man
or
men
no
doubt
in
some
societies
at
some
stages
of
their
development
the
whole
or
a
part
of
the
code
of
laws
habitually
observed
or
at
least
recognised
as
binding
has
been
believed
to
be
of
divine
or
institution
or
perhaps
from
mere
antiquity
to
possess
a
sanctity
superior
to
that
of
any
living
authority
so
as
to
be
not
legitimately
alterable
but
we
hardly
find
this
view
in
the
common
sense
of
civilised
europe
upon
which
we
are
now
reflecting
at
any
rate
in
our
societies
there
is
not
thought
to
be
any
portion
of
the
definite
prescriptions
of
positive
law
which
in
virtue
of
its
origin
is
beyond
the
reach
of
alteration
by
any
living
authority
where
then
is
this
authority
to
be
found
in
the
answers
commonly
given
to
this
question
the
conflict
between
the
ideal
and
the
traditional
or
customary
which
has
perplexed
us
in
seeking
the
definition
of
justice
meets
us
again
in
an
even
more
complicated
form
for
not
only
do
some
say
that
obedience
is
always
due
to
the
traditionally
legitimate
authority
in
any
country
while
others
maintain
that
an
authority
constituted
in
accordance
with
certain
abstract
principles
is
essentially
legitimate
and
that
a
nation
has
a
right
to
claim
that
such
an
authority
shall
be
established
even
at
the
risk
of
civil
strife
and
bloodshed
but
often
too
the
authority
actually
established
is
not
even
traditionally
legitimate
so
that
we
have
to
distinguish
claims
to
authority
each
of
which
may
come
into
conflict
with
either
of
the
other
two
that
of
the
government
held
to
be
ideally
or
abstractly
right
and
such
as
ought
to
be
established
that
of
the
government
according
to
the
constitutional
traditions
in
any
given
country
and
that
of
the
government
let
us
begin
by
considering
the
ideal
here
i
do
not
propose
to
consider
all
views
as
to
the
right
constitution
of
supreme
authority
which
speculative
thinkers
have
put
forward
but
only
such
as
have
a
claim
to
express
the
common
sense
of
mankind
on
the
subject
of
these
the
most
important
and
the
most
widely
urged
and
admitted
is
the
principle
that
the
sovereign
in
any
community
can
only
be
rightly
constituted
by
the
consent
of
the
subjects
this
as
was
noticed
in
the
preceding
chapter
is
involved
in
the
adoption
of
freedom
as
the
ultimate
end
of
political
order
if
no
one
originally
owes
anything
to
another
except
he
clearly
ought
only
to
be
placed
in
the
relation
of
subject
to
sovereign
by
his
own
consent
and
thus
in
order
to
reconcile
the
original
right
of
freedom
with
the
actual
duty
of
some
supposition
of
a
social
compact
appears
necessary
by
means
of
which
obedience
to
law
becomes
merely
a
special
application
of
the
duty
of
keeping
compacts
in
what
way
then
are
the
terms
of
this
fundamental
compact
to
be
known
no
one
now
maintains
the
old
view
that
the
transition
from
the
natural
to
the
political
state
actually
took
place
by
means
of
an
original
contract
which
conferred
indelible
legitimacy
on
some
particular
form
of
social
organisation
shall
we
say
then
that
a
man
by
remaining
a
member
of
a
community
enters
into
a
tacit
undertaking
to
obey
the
laws
and
other
commands
imposed
by
the
authority
generally
recognised
as
lawful
in
that
community
in
this
way
however
the
ideal
lapses
into
the
customary
and
the
most
unlimited
despotism
if
established
and
traditional
might
claim
to
rest
on
free
consent
as
well
as
any
other
form
of
government
so
that
the
principle
of
abstract
freedom
would
lead
to
the
justification
of
the
most
unqualified
concrete
tyranny
and
servitude
and
thus
our
theory
would
end
by
riveting
men
s
chains
under
pretence
of
exalting
their
freedom
if
to
avoid
this
result
we
suppose
that
certain
natural
rights
are
inalienable
or
tacitly
reserved
in
the
tacit
compact
and
that
laws
are
not
strictly
legitimate
which
deprive
a
man
of
these
we
are
again
met
by
the
difficulty
of
deducing
these
inalienable
rights
from
any
clear
and
generally
accepted
principles
for
instance
as
we
have
seen
a
widely
accepted
opinion
is
that
all
such
rights
may
be
summed
up
in
the
notion
of
freedom
but
we
have
also
seen
that
this
principle
is
ambiguous
and
especially
that
the
right
of
private
property
as
commonly
recognised
can
not
be
clearly
deduced
from
it
and
if
so
it
would
certainly
be
most
paradoxical
to
maintain
that
no
government
can
legitimately
claim
obedience
for
any
commands
except
such
as
carry
out
the
principle
of
protecting
from
interference
the
freedom
of
the
individuals
governed
it
has
been
thought
that
we
can
avoid
this
difficulty
by
constituting
the
supreme
organ
of
government
so
that
any
law
laid
down
by
it
will
always
be
a
law
to
which
every
person
called
on
to
obey
it
will
have
consented
personally
or
by
his
representatives
and
that
a
government
so
constituted
in
which
to
adopt
rousseau
s
phrase
every
one
obeys
himself
alone
will
completely
reconcile
freedom
and
order
but
how
is
this
result
to
be
attained
rousseau
held
that
it
could
be
attained
by
pure
direct
democracy
each
individual
subordinating
his
private
will
to
the
general
will
of
the
sovereign
people
of
which
all
are
equally
members
but
this
general
will
must
be
practically
the
will
of
the
majority
and
it
is
paradoxical
to
affirm
that
the
freedom
and
natural
rights
of
a
dissentient
minority
are
effectively
protected
by
establishing
the
condition
that
the
oppressors
must
exceed
the
oppressed
in
number
again
if
the
principle
be
absolute
it
ought
to
apply
to
all
human
beings
alike
and
if
to
avoid
this
absurdity
we
exclude
children
an
arbitrary
line
has
to
be
drawn
and
the
exclusion
of
women
which
even
those
who
regard
the
suffrage
as
a
natural
right
are
often
disposed
to
maintain
seems
altogether
indefensible
and
to
suppose
as
some
have
done
that
the
ideal
of
obeying
oneself
alone
can
be
even
approximately
realised
by
representative
democracy
is
even
more
patently
absurd
for
a
representative
assembly
is
normally
chosen
only
by
a
part
of
the
nation
and
each
law
is
approved
only
by
a
part
of
the
assembly
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
say
that
a
man
has
assented
to
a
law
passed
by
a
mere
majority
of
an
assembly
against
one
member
of
which
he
has
voted
but
again
to
lay
down
absolutely
that
the
laws
of
any
community
ought
to
express
the
will
of
the
majority
of
its
members
seems
incompatible
with
the
view
so
vigorously
maintained
by
socrates
and
his
most
famous
disciples
that
laws
ought
to
be
made
by
people
who
understand
for
though
the
majority
of
a
representative
assembly
in
a
particular
country
at
a
particular
time
may
be
more
fit
to
make
laws
for
their
country
than
any
set
of
experts
otherwise
selected
it
is
certainly
not
that
this
will
be
universally
the
case
yet
surely
the
socratic
proposition
which
is
merely
a
special
application
of
the
principle
noticed
in
the
latter
part
of
the
preceding
chapter
that
function
should
be
allotted
to
the
fittest
has
as
much
claim
to
be
considered
a
primary
intuition
as
the
one
that
we
have
been
discussing
indeed
the
secular
controversy
between
aristocracy
and
democracy
seems
ultimately
reducible
to
a
conflict
between
those
two
principles
a
conflict
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
solution
so
long
as
the
argument
remains
in
the
region
however
to
discuss
this
exhaustively
would
carry
us
too
far
beyond
the
range
of
ethics
proper
but
we
may
perhaps
conclude
that
it
is
impossible
to
elicit
from
common
sense
any
clear
and
certain
intuitions
as
to
the
principles
on
which
an
ideal
constitution
should
be
constructed
and
there
is
an
equal
want
of
agreement
as
to
the
intrinsic
lawfulness
of
introducing
such
a
constitution
in
violation
of
the
traditional
and
established
order
in
any
community
for
some
think
that
a
nation
has
a
natural
right
to
a
government
approximately
conformed
to
the
ideal
and
that
this
right
may
be
maintained
by
force
in
the
last
resort
others
however
hold
that
though
the
ideal
polity
may
rightly
be
put
forward
and
commended
and
every
means
used
to
promote
its
realisation
which
the
established
government
in
any
country
permits
still
rebellion
can
never
be
justifiable
for
this
purpose
alone
while
others
perhaps
the
majority
would
decide
the
question
on
grounds
of
expediency
balancing
the
advantages
of
improvement
against
the
evils
of
disorder
but
further
as
we
saw
it
is
not
so
easy
to
say
what
the
established
government
is
for
sometimes
an
authority
declared
by
law
to
be
illegitimate
issues
ordinances
and
controls
the
administration
of
justice
the
question
then
arises
how
far
obedience
is
due
to
such
an
authority
all
are
agreed
that
usurpation
ought
to
be
resisted
but
as
to
the
right
behaviour
towards
an
established
government
which
has
sprung
from
a
successful
usurpation
there
is
a
great
difference
of
opinion
some
think
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
legitimate
as
soon
as
it
is
firmly
established
others
that
it
ought
to
be
obeyed
at
once
but
under
protest
with
the
purpose
of
renewing
the
conflict
on
a
favourable
opportunity
others
think
that
this
latter
is
the
right
attitude
at
first
but
that
a
usurping
government
when
firmly
established
loses
its
illegitimacy
gradually
and
that
it
becomes
after
a
while
as
criminal
to
rebel
against
it
as
it
was
originally
to
establish
it
and
this
last
seems
on
the
whole
the
view
of
common
sense
but
the
point
at
which
the
metamorphosis
is
thought
to
take
place
can
hardly
be
determined
otherwise
than
by
considerations
of
expediency
but
again
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
an
absolute
government
where
customary
obedience
is
unconditionally
due
to
one
or
more
persons
that
the
fundamental
difficulties
of
ascertaining
the
legitimacy
of
authority
are
of
the
simple
kind
just
discussed
in
a
constitutionally
governed
state
numerous
other
moral
disagreements
arise
for
in
such
a
state
while
it
is
of
course
held
that
the
sovereign
is
morally
bound
to
conform
to
the
constitution
it
is
still
disputed
whether
the
subjects
obligation
to
obedience
is
properly
conceived
as
conditional
upon
this
conformity
and
whether
they
have
the
moral
right
to
refuse
obedience
to
an
unconstitutional
command
and
even
to
inflict
on
the
sovereign
the
penalty
of
rebellion
for
violating
the
constitution
again
in
determining
what
the
constitutional
obligations
really
are
we
find
much
perplexity
and
disagreement
not
merely
as
to
the
exact
ascertainment
of
the
relevant
historical
facts
but
as
to
the
principles
on
which
these
facts
ought
to
be
treated
for
the
various
limitations
of
sovereign
authority
comprised
in
the
constitution
have
often
been
originally
concessions
extorted
by
fear
from
a
sovereign
previously
absolute
and
it
is
doubted
how
far
such
concessions
are
morally
binding
on
the
sovereign
from
whom
they
were
wrested
and
still
more
how
far
they
are
binding
on
succeeding
sovereigns
or
a
people
may
have
allowed
liberties
once
exercised
to
fall
into
disuse
and
it
is
doubted
whether
it
retains
the
right
of
reclaiming
them
and
generally
when
a
constitutional
rule
has
to
be
elicited
from
a
comparison
of
precedents
it
is
open
to
dispute
whether
a
particular
act
of
either
party
should
be
regarded
as
a
constitutive
precedent
or
as
an
illegitimate
encroachment
and
hence
we
find
that
in
constitutional
countries
men
s
view
of
what
their
constitution
traditionally
is
has
often
been
greatly
influenced
by
their
view
of
what
it
ideally
ought
to
be
in
fact
the
two
questions
have
rarely
been
kept
quite
distinct
but
even
in
cases
where
we
can
ascertain
clearly
to
what
authority
obedience
is
properly
due
further
difficulties
are
liable
to
arise
when
we
attempt
to
define
the
limits
of
such
obedience
for
in
modern
society
as
we
have
seen
all
admit
that
any
authority
ought
to
be
disobeyed
which
commands
immoral
acts
but
this
is
one
of
those
tautological
propositions
so
common
in
popular
morality
which
convey
no
real
information
the
question
is
what
acts
there
are
which
do
not
cease
to
be
immoral
when
they
have
been
commanded
by
a
rightful
authority
there
seems
to
be
no
clear
principle
upon
which
these
can
be
determined
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
the
law
can
not
override
definite
duties
but
the
obligation
of
fidelity
to
contract
is
peculiarly
definite
and
yet
we
do
not
consider
it
right
to
fulfil
a
contract
of
which
a
law
passed
subsequently
to
the
making
of
the
contract
has
forbidden
the
execution
and
in
fact
we
do
not
find
any
practical
agreement
on
this
question
among
persons
who
would
not
consciously
accept
the
utilitarian
method
of
deciding
it
by
a
balance
of
conflicting
expediences
for
some
would
say
that
the
duties
of
the
domestic
relations
must
yield
to
the
duty
of
and
that
a
son
ought
not
to
aid
a
parent
actively
or
passively
in
escaping
the
punishment
of
crime
while
others
would
consider
this
rule
too
inhuman
to
be
laid
down
and
others
would
draw
the
line
between
assistance
and
connivance
and
similarly
when
a
rightly
constituted
government
commands
acts
unjust
and
oppressive
to
others
common
sense
recoils
from
saying
either
that
all
such
commands
ought
to
be
obeyed
or
that
all
ought
to
be
disobeyed
but
apart
from
utilitarian
considerations
i
can
find
no
clear
accepted
principle
for
distinguishing
those
unjust
commands
of
a
legitimate
government
which
ought
to
be
obeyed
from
those
which
ought
not
to
be
obeyed
again
some
jurists
hold
that
we
are
not
strictly
bound
to
obey
laws
when
they
command
what
is
not
otherwise
a
duty
or
forbid
what
is
not
otherwise
a
sin
on
the
ground
that
in
the
case
of
duties
prescribed
only
by
positive
laws
the
alternatives
of
obeying
or
submitting
to
the
penalty
are
morally
open
to
us
others
however
think
this
principle
too
lax
and
certainly
if
a
widespread
preference
of
penalty
to
obedience
were
shown
in
the
case
of
any
particular
law
the
legislation
in
question
would
be
thought
to
have
failed
nor
on
the
other
hand
does
there
seem
to
be
any
agreement
as
to
whether
one
is
bound
to
submit
to
unjust
penalties
since
then
on
all
these
points
there
is
found
to
be
so
much
difference
of
opinion
it
seems
idle
to
maintain
that
there
is
any
clear
and
precise
axiom
or
first
principle
of
order
intuitively
seen
to
be
true
by
the
common
reason
and
conscience
of
mankind
there
is
no
doubt
a
vague
general
habit
of
obedience
to
laws
as
such
even
if
bad
laws
which
may
fairly
claim
the
universal
of
civilised
society
but
when
we
try
to
state
any
explicit
principle
corresponding
to
this
general
habit
the
seems
to
abandon
us
and
we
are
inevitably
drawn
into
controversies
which
seem
to
admit
of
no
solution
except
that
offered
by
the
utilitarian
method
we
have
next
to
treat
of
good
faith
or
fidelity
to
promises
which
it
is
natural
to
consider
in
this
place
because
as
has
been
seen
the
duty
of
has
by
some
thinkers
been
based
upon
a
prior
duty
of
fulfilling
a
contract
the
social
contract
however
as
above
examined
seems
at
best
merely
a
convenient
fiction
a
logical
artifice
by
which
the
mutual
jural
relations
of
the
members
of
a
civilised
community
may
be
neatly
expressed
and
in
stating
the
ethical
principles
of
common
sense
such
a
fiction
would
seem
to
be
out
of
place
it
must
however
be
allowed
that
there
has
frequently
been
a
close
historical
connection
between
the
duty
of
and
the
duty
of
good
faith
in
the
first
place
a
considerable
amount
of
constitutional
law
at
least
in
certain
ages
and
countries
has
been
established
or
confirmed
by
compacts
expressly
made
between
different
sections
of
the
community
who
agree
that
for
the
future
government
shall
be
carried
on
according
to
certain
rules
the
duty
of
observing
these
rules
thus
presents
itself
as
a
duty
of
fidelity
to
compact
yet
more
is
this
the
case
when
the
question
is
one
of
imposing
not
a
law
but
a
whose
authority
is
strengthened
by
the
exaction
of
an
oath
of
allegiance
from
his
subjects
generally
or
a
representative
portion
of
them
still
even
in
such
cases
it
can
only
be
by
a
palpable
fiction
that
the
mass
of
the
citizens
can
be
regarded
as
bound
by
an
engagement
which
only
a
few
of
them
have
actually
taken
we
may
begin
our
examination
of
the
duty
of
keeping
promises
by
noticing
that
some
moralists
have
classified
or
even
identified
it
with
veracity
from
one
point
of
view
there
certainly
seems
to
be
an
analogy
between
the
two
as
we
fulfil
the
obligations
of
veracity
and
good
faith
alike
by
effecting
a
correspondence
between
words
and
facts
in
the
one
case
by
making
fact
correspond
with
statement
and
in
the
other
by
making
statement
correspond
with
fact
but
the
analogy
is
obviously
superficial
and
imperfect
for
we
are
not
bound
to
make
our
actions
correspond
with
our
assertions
generally
but
only
with
our
promises
if
i
merely
assert
my
intention
of
abstaining
from
alcohol
for
a
year
and
then
after
a
week
take
some
i
am
at
worst
ridiculed
as
inconsistent
but
if
i
have
pledged
myself
to
abstain
i
am
blamed
as
untrustworthy
thus
the
essential
element
of
the
duty
of
good
faith
seems
to
be
not
conformity
to
my
own
statement
but
to
expectations
that
i
have
intentionally
raised
in
others
on
this
view
however
the
question
arises
whether
when
a
promise
has
been
understood
in
a
sense
not
intended
by
the
promiser
he
is
bound
to
satisfy
expectations
which
he
did
not
voluntarily
create
it
is
i
think
clear
to
common
sense
that
he
is
so
bound
in
some
cases
if
the
expectation
was
natural
and
such
as
most
men
would
form
under
the
circumstances
but
this
would
seem
to
be
one
of
the
more
or
less
indefinite
duties
of
justice
and
not
properly
of
good
faith
as
there
has
not
been
strictly
speaking
any
promise
at
all
the
normal
effect
of
language
is
to
convey
the
speaker
s
meaning
to
the
person
addressed
here
the
promiser
s
to
the
promisee
and
we
always
suppose
this
to
have
taken
place
when
we
speak
of
a
promise
if
through
any
accident
this
normal
effect
is
missed
we
may
say
that
there
is
no
promise
or
not
a
perfect
promise
the
moral
obligation
then
of
a
promise
is
perfectly
constituted
when
it
is
understood
by
both
parties
in
the
same
sense
and
by
the
term
promise
we
include
not
words
only
but
all
signs
and
even
tacit
understandings
not
expressly
signified
in
any
way
if
such
clearly
form
a
part
of
the
engagement
the
promiser
is
bound
to
perform
what
both
he
and
the
promisee
understood
to
be
undertaken
is
then
this
obligation
intuitively
seen
to
be
independent
and
certain
it
is
often
said
to
be
so
and
perhaps
we
may
say
that
it
seems
so
to
unreflective
common
sense
but
reflection
seems
at
least
to
disclose
a
considerable
number
of
qualifications
of
the
principle
some
clear
and
precise
while
others
are
more
or
less
indefinite
in
the
first
place
thoughtful
persons
would
commonly
admit
that
the
obligation
of
a
promise
is
relative
to
the
promisee
and
may
be
annulled
by
him
and
therefore
if
the
promisee
be
dead
or
otherwise
inaccessible
and
incapable
of
granting
release
there
is
constituted
an
exceptional
case
of
which
the
solution
presents
some
difficulty
secondly
a
promise
to
do
an
immoral
act
is
held
not
to
be
binding
because
the
prior
obligation
not
to
do
the
act
is
paramount
just
as
in
law
a
contract
to
do
what
a
man
is
not
legally
free
to
do
is
invalid
otherwise
one
could
evade
any
moral
obligation
by
promising
not
to
fulfil
it
which
is
clearly
absurd
and
the
same
principle
is
of
course
applicable
to
immoral
omissions
or
forbearances
to
act
here
however
a
certain
difficulty
arises
from
the
necessity
of
distinguishing
between
different
kinds
or
degrees
of
obligatoriness
in
duties
since
it
is
clear
that
a
promise
may
sometimes
make
it
obligatory
to
abstain
from
doing
what
it
would
otherwise
have
been
a
duty
to
do
thus
it
becomes
my
duty
not
to
give
money
to
a
meritorious
hospital
if
i
have
promised
all
i
can
spare
to
an
undeserving
friend
though
apart
from
the
promise
it
might
have
been
my
duty
to
prefer
the
hospital
to
the
friend
we
have
however
already
seen
the
difficulty
of
defining
the
limits
of
strict
duty
in
many
cases
thus
it
might
be
doubted
how
far
the
promise
of
aid
to
a
friend
ought
to
override
the
duty
of
giving
one
s
children
a
good
education
the
extent
therefore
to
which
the
obligation
of
a
promise
overrides
prior
obligations
becomes
practically
somewhat
obscure
further
qualifications
of
the
duty
of
fidelity
to
promises
the
consideration
of
which
is
involved
in
more
difficulty
and
dispute
are
suggested
when
we
examine
more
closely
the
conditions
under
which
promises
are
made
and
the
consequences
of
executing
them
in
the
first
place
it
is
much
disputed
how
far
promises
obtained
by
fraud
or
force
are
binding
as
regards
fraud
if
the
promise
was
understood
to
be
conditional
on
the
truth
of
a
statement
which
is
found
to
be
false
it
is
of
course
not
binding
according
to
the
principle
i
originally
laid
down
but
a
promise
may
be
made
in
consequence
of
such
a
fraudulent
statement
and
yet
made
quite
unconditionally
even
so
if
it
were
clearly
understood
that
it
would
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
false
statement
probably
most
persons
would
regard
it
as
not
binding
but
the
false
statement
may
be
only
one
consideration
among
others
and
it
may
be
of
any
degree
of
weight
and
it
seems
doubtful
whether
we
should
feel
justified
in
breaking
a
promise
because
a
single
fraudulent
statement
had
been
a
part
of
the
inducement
to
make
it
still
more
if
there
has
been
no
explicit
assertion
but
only
a
suggestion
of
what
is
false
or
no
falsehood
at
all
stated
or
suggested
but
only
a
concealment
of
material
circumstances
we
may
observe
that
certain
kinds
of
concealment
are
treated
as
legitimate
by
our
law
in
most
contracts
of
sale
for
example
the
law
adopts
the
principle
of
caveat
emptor
and
does
not
refuse
to
enforce
the
contract
because
the
seller
did
not
disclose
defects
in
the
article
sold
unless
by
some
words
or
acts
he
produced
the
belief
that
it
was
free
from
such
defects
still
this
does
not
settle
the
moral
question
how
far
a
promise
is
binding
if
any
material
concealment
is
shown
to
have
been
used
to
obtain
it
we
have
also
to
consider
the
case
in
which
an
erroneous
impression
has
not
been
wilfully
produced
but
was
either
shared
by
the
promisee
or
produced
in
some
way
unintentionally
perhaps
in
this
last
case
most
would
say
that
the
bindingness
of
the
promise
is
not
affected
unless
it
was
expressly
conditional
but
on
all
these
points
common
sense
seems
doubtful
and
somewhat
similar
difficulties
present
themselves
when
we
endeavour
to
define
the
obligation
of
promises
partly
obtained
by
some
degree
of
illegal
violence
and
intimidation
but
secondly
even
if
a
promise
has
been
made
quite
freely
and
fairly
circumstances
may
alter
so
much
before
the
time
comes
to
fulfil
it
that
the
effects
of
keeping
it
may
be
quite
other
than
those
which
were
foreseen
when
it
was
made
in
such
a
case
probably
all
would
agree
that
the
promisee
ought
to
release
the
promiser
but
if
he
declines
to
do
this
it
seems
difficult
to
decide
how
far
the
latter
is
bound
some
would
say
that
he
is
in
all
cases
while
others
would
consider
that
a
considerable
alteration
of
circumstances
removed
the
obligation
perhaps
adding
that
all
engagements
must
be
understood
to
be
taken
subject
to
a
general
understanding
that
they
are
only
binding
if
material
circumstances
remain
substantially
the
same
but
such
a
principle
very
much
impairs
the
theoretical
definiteness
of
the
duty
this
difficulty
assumes
a
new
aspect
when
we
consider
the
case
already
noticed
of
promises
made
to
those
who
are
now
dead
or
temporarily
out
of
the
reach
of
communications
for
then
there
is
no
means
of
obtaining
release
from
the
promise
while
at
the
same
time
its
performance
may
be
really
opposed
to
the
wishes
or
what
would
have
been
the
wishes
of
both
parties
the
difficulty
is
sometimes
concealed
by
saying
that
it
is
our
duty
to
carry
out
the
intention
of
the
promise
for
as
so
used
the
word
intention
is
in
common
parlance
ambiguous
it
may
either
mean
the
signification
which
the
promisee
attached
to
the
terms
employed
as
distinct
from
any
other
signification
which
the
common
usage
of
words
might
admit
or
it
may
include
ulterior
consequences
of
the
performance
of
the
promise
which
he
had
in
view
in
exacting
it
now
we
do
not
commonly
think
that
the
promiser
is
concerned
with
the
latter
he
certainly
has
not
pledged
himself
to
aim
generally
at
the
end
which
the
promisee
has
in
view
but
only
so
far
as
some
particular
means
are
concerned
and
if
he
considers
these
means
not
conducive
to
the
end
he
is
not
thereby
absolved
from
his
promise
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
in
the
case
supposed
when
circumstances
have
materially
changed
and
the
promise
does
not
admit
of
revision
probably
most
persons
would
say
that
we
ought
to
take
into
consideration
the
ulterior
wishes
of
the
promisee
and
carry
out
what
we
sincerely
think
have
been
his
intention
but
the
obligation
thus
becomes
very
vague
since
it
is
difficult
to
tell
from
a
man
s
wishes
under
one
set
of
circumstances
what
he
would
have
desired
under
circumstances
varying
from
these
in
a
complex
manner
and
practically
this
view
of
the
obligation
of
a
promise
generally
leads
to
great
divergence
of
opinion
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
some
hold
that
even
in
such
a
case
the
obligation
ought
to
be
interpreted
strictly
while
others
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
maintain
that
it
ceases
altogether
but
again
it
was
said
that
a
promise
can
not
abrogate
a
prior
obligation
and
as
a
particular
application
of
this
rule
it
would
be
generally
agreed
that
no
promise
can
make
it
right
to
inflict
harm
on
any
one
on
further
consideration
however
it
appears
doubtful
how
far
the
persons
between
whom
the
promise
passed
are
included
in
the
scope
of
this
restriction
for
first
it
does
not
seem
to
be
commonly
held
that
a
man
is
as
strictly
bound
not
to
injure
himself
as
he
is
to
avoid
harming
others
and
so
it
is
scarcely
thought
that
a
promise
is
not
binding
because
it
was
a
foolish
one
and
will
entail
an
amount
of
pain
or
burden
on
the
promiser
out
of
proportion
to
the
good
done
to
the
promisee
still
if
we
take
an
extreme
case
where
the
sacrifice
is
very
disproportionate
to
the
gain
many
conscientious
persons
would
think
that
the
promise
ought
rather
to
be
broken
than
kept
and
secondly
a
different
question
arises
when
we
consider
the
possibility
of
injuring
the
promisee
by
fulfilling
the
promise
for
when
it
is
said
to
be
wrong
to
do
harm
to
any
one
we
do
not
commonly
mean
only
what
he
thinks
harm
but
what
really
is
so
though
he
may
think
it
a
benefit
for
it
seems
clearly
a
crime
for
me
to
give
any
one
what
i
know
to
be
poison
even
though
he
may
be
stubbornly
convinced
that
it
is
wholesome
food
but
now
suppose
that
i
have
promised
to
do
something
which
before
i
fulfil
the
promise
i
see
reason
to
regard
as
likely
to
injure
him
the
circumstances
may
be
precisely
the
same
and
only
my
view
of
them
have
changed
if
takes
a
different
view
and
calls
on
me
to
fulfil
the
promise
is
it
right
to
obey
him
surely
no
one
would
say
this
in
an
extreme
case
such
as
that
of
the
poison
but
if
the
rule
does
not
hold
for
an
extreme
case
where
can
we
draw
the
line
at
what
point
ought
i
to
give
up
my
judgment
to
unless
my
own
conviction
is
weakened
common
sense
seems
to
give
no
clear
answer
i
have
laid
down
that
a
promise
is
binding
in
so
far
as
it
is
understood
on
both
sides
similarly
and
such
an
understanding
is
ordinarily
attained
with
sufficient
clearness
as
far
as
the
apprehension
of
express
words
or
signs
is
concerned
still
even
here
obscurity
and
misapprehension
sometimes
occur
and
in
the
case
of
the
tacit
understandings
with
which
promises
are
often
complicated
a
lack
of
definite
agreement
is
not
improbable
it
becomes
therefore
of
practical
importance
to
decide
the
question
previously
raised
what
duty
rests
on
the
promiser
of
satisfying
expectations
which
he
did
not
intend
to
create
i
called
this
a
duty
not
so
much
of
good
faith
as
of
justice
which
prescribes
the
fulfilment
of
normal
expectations
how
then
shall
we
determine
what
these
are
the
method
by
which
we
commonly
ascertain
them
seems
to
be
the
following
we
form
the
conception
of
an
average
or
normal
man
and
consider
what
expectations
he
would
form
under
the
circumstances
inferring
this
from
the
beliefs
and
expectations
which
men
generally
entertain
under
similar
circumstances
we
refer
therefore
to
the
customary
use
of
language
and
customary
tacit
understandings
current
among
persons
in
the
particular
relations
in
which
promiser
and
promisee
stand
such
customary
interpretations
and
understandings
are
of
course
not
obligatory
upon
persons
entering
into
an
engagement
but
they
constitute
a
standard
which
we
think
we
may
presume
to
be
known
to
all
men
and
to
be
accepted
by
them
except
in
so
for
as
it
is
explicitly
rejected
if
one
of
the
parties
to
an
engagement
has
deviated
from
this
common
standard
without
giving
express
notice
we
think
it
right
that
he
should
suffer
any
loss
that
may
result
from
the
misunderstanding
this
criterion
then
is
generally
applicable
but
if
custom
is
ambiguous
or
shifting
it
can
not
be
applied
and
then
the
just
claims
of
the
parties
become
a
problem
the
solution
of
which
is
very
difficult
if
not
strictly
indeterminate
so
far
we
have
supposed
that
the
promiser
can
choose
his
own
words
and
that
if
the
promisee
finds
them
ambiguous
he
can
get
them
modified
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
explained
by
the
promiser
but
we
have
now
to
observe
that
in
the
case
of
promises
made
to
the
community
as
a
condition
of
obtaining
some
office
or
emolument
a
certain
unalterable
form
of
words
has
to
be
used
if
the
promise
is
made
at
all
here
the
difficulties
of
moral
interpretation
are
much
increased
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
the
promise
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
the
sense
in
which
its
terms
are
understood
by
the
community
and
no
doubt
if
their
usage
is
quite
uniform
and
unambiguous
this
rule
of
interpretation
is
sufficiently
obvious
and
simple
but
since
words
are
often
used
in
different
ways
by
different
members
of
the
same
society
and
especially
with
different
degrees
of
strictness
and
laxity
it
often
happens
that
a
promise
to
the
community
can
not
strictly
be
said
to
be
understood
in
any
one
sense
the
question
therefore
arises
whether
the
promiser
is
bound
to
keep
it
in
the
sense
in
which
it
will
be
most
commonly
interpreted
or
whether
he
may
select
any
of
its
possible
meanings
and
if
the
formula
is
one
of
some
antiquity
it
is
further
questioned
whether
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
the
sense
which
its
words
would
now
generally
bear
or
in
that
which
they
bore
when
it
was
drawn
up
or
if
they
were
then
ambiguous
in
the
sense
which
appears
to
have
been
attached
to
them
by
the
government
that
imposed
the
promise
on
all
these
points
it
is
difficult
to
elicit
any
clear
view
from
common
sense
and
the
difficulty
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
there
are
usually
strong
inducements
to
make
these
formal
engagements
which
cause
even
tolerably
conscientious
persons
to
take
them
in
a
strained
and
unnatural
sense
when
this
has
been
done
continually
by
many
persons
a
new
general
understanding
grows
up
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
engagements
sometimes
they
come
to
be
regarded
as
mere
forms
or
if
they
do
not
reach
this
point
of
degradation
they
are
at
least
understood
in
a
sense
differing
indefinitely
from
their
original
one
the
question
then
arises
how
far
this
process
of
gradual
illegitimate
relaxation
or
perversion
can
modify
the
moral
obligation
of
the
promise
for
a
thoroughly
conscientious
person
it
seems
clear
that
when
the
process
is
complete
we
are
right
in
adopting
the
new
understanding
as
far
as
good
faith
is
concerned
even
if
it
palpably
conflicts
with
the
natural
meaning
of
language
although
it
is
always
desirable
in
such
cases
that
the
form
of
the
promise
should
be
changed
to
correspond
with
the
changed
substance
but
when
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
the
process
is
incomplete
since
a
portion
of
the
community
understands
the
engagement
in
the
original
strict
sense
the
obligation
becomes
difficult
to
determine
and
the
judgments
of
conscientious
persons
respecting
it
become
divergent
and
perplexed
to
sum
up
the
results
of
the
discussion
it
appears
that
a
clear
can
only
be
claimed
for
the
principle
that
a
promise
express
or
tacit
is
binding
if
a
number
of
conditions
are
fulfilled
viz
if
the
promiser
has
a
clear
belief
as
to
the
sense
in
which
it
was
understood
by
the
promisee
and
if
the
latter
is
still
in
a
position
to
grant
release
from
it
but
unwilling
to
do
so
if
it
was
not
obtained
by
force
or
fraud
if
it
does
not
conflict
with
definite
prior
obligations
if
we
do
not
believe
that
its
fulfilment
will
be
harmful
to
the
promisee
or
will
inflict
a
disproportionate
sacrifice
on
the
promiser
and
if
circumstances
have
not
materially
changed
since
it
was
made
if
any
of
these
conditions
fails
the
seems
to
become
evanescent
and
the
common
moral
perceptions
of
thoughtful
persons
fall
into
obscurity
and
disagreement
footnotes
cf
book
ii
chap
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
that
i
should
here
notice
the
hobbist
doctrine
revived
in
a
modified
form
by
austin
that
the
power
of
the
sovereign
is
incapable
of
legal
for
no
one
now
maintains
pure
hobbism
and
austin
is
as
far
as
possible
from
meaning
that
there
can
not
be
an
express
or
tacit
understanding
between
sovereign
and
subjects
the
violation
of
which
by
the
former
may
make
it
morally
right
for
the
latter
to
rebel
in
fact
as
used
by
him
hobbes
doctrine
reduces
itself
to
the
rather
unimportant
proposition
that
a
sovereign
will
not
be
punished
for
unconstitutional
conduct
through
the
agency
of
his
own
so
long
as
he
remains
sovereign
i
may
take
this
opportunity
of
observing
that
austin
s
definition
of
law
is
manifestly
unsuited
for
our
present
purpose
since
a
law
in
his
view
is
not
a
command
that
ought
to
be
obeyed
but
a
command
for
the
violation
of
which
we
may
expect
a
particular
kind
of
punishment
cf
blackstone
in
relation
to
those
laws
which
enjoin
only
positive
duties
and
forbid
only
such
things
as
are
not
in
but
merely
without
any
intermixture
of
moral
guilt
annexing
a
penalty
to
here
i
apprehend
conscience
is
no
further
concerned
than
by
directing
a
submission
to
the
penalty
in
case
of
our
breach
of
those
laws
the
alternative
is
offered
to
every
man
either
abstain
from
this
or
submit
to
such
a
into
the
ethical
difficulties
peculiar
to
international
law
i
have
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
enter
vows
to
god
constitute
another
exception
and
it
is
thought
by
many
that
if
these
are
binding
there
must
be
some
way
in
which
god
can
be
understood
to
grant
release
from
them
but
this
it
is
beyond
my
province
to
discuss
the
case
is
somewhat
different
when
the
act
has
become
immoral
after
the
promise
was
made
still
here
also
the
prior
duty
of
abstaining
from
it
would
be
universally
held
to
prevail
what
is
here
said
of
a
statement
may
be
extended
to
any
mode
of
producing
a
false
impression
chapter
vii
the
classification
of
duties
veracity
it
may
easily
seem
that
when
we
have
discussed
benevolence
justice
and
the
observance
of
law
and
contract
we
have
included
in
our
view
the
whole
sphere
of
social
duty
and
that
whatever
other
maxims
we
find
accepted
by
common
sense
must
be
subordinate
to
the
principles
which
we
have
been
trying
to
define
for
whatever
we
owe
definitely
to
our
besides
the
observance
of
special
contracts
and
of
positive
laws
seems
at
least
by
a
slight
extension
of
common
usage
to
be
naturally
included
under
justice
while
the
more
indefinite
obligations
which
we
recognise
seem
to
correspond
to
the
goodwill
which
we
think
ought
to
exist
among
all
members
of
the
human
family
together
with
the
stronger
affections
appropriate
to
special
relations
and
circumstances
and
hence
it
may
be
thought
that
the
best
way
of
treating
the
subject
would
have
been
to
divide
duty
generally
into
social
and
and
again
to
subdivide
the
former
branch
into
the
heads
which
i
have
discussed
one
by
one
afterwards
adding
such
minor
details
of
duty
as
have
obtained
special
names
and
distinct
recognition
and
this
is
perhaps
the
proper
place
to
explain
why
i
did
not
adopt
this
course
the
division
of
duties
into
social
and
though
obvious
and
acceptable
enough
as
a
rough
classification
does
not
on
closer
examination
seem
exactly
appropriate
to
the
intuitional
method
for
these
titles
naturally
suggest
that
the
happiness
or
of
the
agent
or
of
others
is
always
the
end
and
final
determinant
of
right
action
whereas
the
intuitional
doctrine
is
that
at
least
certain
kinds
of
conduct
are
prescribed
absolutely
without
reference
to
their
ulterior
consequences
and
if
a
more
general
meaning
be
given
to
the
terms
and
by
social
duties
we
understand
those
which
consist
in
the
production
of
certain
effects
upon
others
while
in
the
we
aim
at
producing
certain
effects
upon
ourselves
the
division
is
still
an
unsuitable
one
for
these
consequences
are
not
clearly
recognised
in
the
enunciation
of
common
rules
of
morality
and
in
many
cases
we
produce
marked
effects
both
on
ourselves
and
on
others
and
it
is
not
easy
to
say
which
in
the
view
of
common
sense
are
most
important
and
again
this
principle
of
division
would
sometimes
make
it
necessary
to
cut
in
two
the
class
of
duties
prescribed
under
some
common
notion
as
the
same
rule
may
govern
both
our
social
and
our
solitary
conduct
take
for
example
the
acts
morally
prescribed
under
the
head
of
courage
it
seems
clear
that
the
prominence
given
to
this
virtue
in
historic
systems
of
morality
has
been
due
to
the
great
social
importance
that
must
always
attach
to
it
so
long
as
communities
of
men
are
continually
called
upon
to
fight
for
their
existence
and
but
still
the
quality
of
bravery
is
the
same
essentially
whether
it
be
exhibited
for
selfish
or
social
ends
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
when
we
examine
with
a
view
to
definition
the
kinds
of
conduct
commended
or
prescribed
in
any
list
of
virtues
commonly
recognised
we
find
to
a
great
extent
that
the
maxims
we
obtain
are
clearly
not
absolute
and
independent
that
the
quality
denoted
by
our
term
is
admittedly
only
praiseworthy
in
so
far
as
it
promotes
individual
or
general
welfare
and
becomes
blameworthy
though
remaining
in
other
respects
the
same
when
it
operates
adversely
to
these
ends
we
have
already
noticed
this
result
in
one
or
two
instances
and
it
will
be
illustrated
at
length
in
the
following
chapters
but
though
this
is
the
case
to
a
great
extent
it
is
for
our
present
purpose
of
special
importance
to
note
the
real
or
apparent
exceptions
to
the
rule
because
they
are
specially
characteristic
of
the
method
that
we
call
intuitionism
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
exceptions
is
veracity
and
the
affinity
in
certain
respects
of
this
duty
in
spite
of
fundamental
differences
to
the
duty
of
good
faith
or
fidelity
to
promises
renders
it
convenient
to
examine
the
two
in
immediate
succession
under
either
head
a
certain
correspondence
between
words
and
facts
is
prescribed
and
hence
the
questions
that
arise
when
we
try
to
make
the
maxims
precise
are
somewhat
similar
in
both
cases
for
example
just
as
the
duty
of
good
faith
did
not
lie
in
conforming
our
acts
to
the
meaning
of
certain
words
but
to
the
meaning
which
we
knew
to
be
put
on
them
by
the
promisee
so
the
duty
of
truthspeaking
is
not
to
utter
words
which
according
to
common
usage
produce
in
other
minds
beliefs
corresponding
to
our
own
but
words
which
we
believe
will
have
this
effect
on
the
persons
whom
we
address
and
this
is
usually
a
very
simple
matter
as
the
natural
effect
of
language
is
to
convey
our
beliefs
to
other
men
and
we
commonly
know
quite
well
whether
we
are
doing
this
or
not
a
certain
difficulty
arises
as
in
the
case
of
promises
from
the
use
of
set
forms
imposed
either
by
law
or
by
custom
to
which
most
of
the
discussion
of
the
similar
difficulty
in
the
preceding
chapter
applies
with
obvious
modifications
in
the
case
of
formulæ
imposed
by
law
such
as
declarations
of
religious
belief
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
may
understand
the
terms
in
any
sense
which
they
commonly
bear
or
are
to
take
them
in
the
sense
intended
by
the
legislature
that
imposed
them
and
again
a
difficulty
is
created
by
the
gradual
degradation
or
perversion
of
their
meaning
which
results
from
the
strong
inducements
offered
for
their
general
acceptance
for
thus
they
are
continually
strained
and
stretched
until
a
new
general
understanding
seems
gradually
to
grow
up
as
to
the
meaning
of
certain
phrases
and
it
is
continually
disputed
whether
we
may
veraciously
use
the
phrases
in
this
new
signification
a
similar
process
continually
alters
the
meaning
of
conventional
expressions
current
in
polite
society
when
a
man
declares
that
he
has
great
pleasure
in
accepting
a
vexatious
invitation
or
is
the
obedient
servant
of
one
whom
he
regards
as
an
inferior
he
uses
phrases
which
were
probably
once
deceptive
if
they
are
so
no
longer
common
sense
condemns
as
the
refusal
to
use
them
where
it
is
customary
to
do
so
but
common
sense
seems
doubtful
and
perplexed
where
the
process
of
degradation
is
incomplete
and
there
are
still
persons
who
may
be
deceived
as
in
the
use
of
the
reply
that
one
is
not
at
home
to
an
inconvenient
visitor
from
the
country
however
apart
from
the
use
of
conventional
phrases
the
rule
to
speak
the
truth
is
not
generally
difficult
of
application
in
conduct
and
many
moralists
have
regarded
this
from
its
simplicity
and
definiteness
as
a
quite
unexceptionable
instance
of
an
ethical
axiom
i
think
however
that
patient
reflection
will
show
that
this
view
is
not
really
confirmed
by
the
common
sense
of
mankind
in
the
first
place
it
does
not
seem
clearly
agreed
whether
veracity
is
an
absolute
and
independent
duty
or
a
special
application
of
some
higher
principle
we
find
that
kant
regards
it
as
a
duty
owed
to
oneself
to
speak
the
truth
because
a
lie
is
an
abandonment
or
as
it
were
annihilation
of
the
dignity
of
and
this
seems
to
be
the
view
in
which
lying
is
prohibited
by
the
code
of
honour
except
that
it
is
not
thought
by
men
of
honour
as
such
that
the
dignity
of
man
is
impaired
by
lying
but
only
that
lying
for
selfish
ends
especially
under
the
influence
of
fear
is
mean
and
base
in
fact
there
seems
to
be
circumstances
under
which
the
code
of
honour
prescribes
lying
here
however
it
may
be
said
to
be
plainly
divergent
from
the
morality
of
common
sense
still
the
latter
does
not
seem
to
decide
clearly
whether
is
absolutely
a
duty
needing
no
further
justification
or
whether
it
is
merely
a
general
right
of
each
man
to
have
truth
spoken
to
him
by
his
fellows
which
right
however
may
be
forfeited
or
suspended
under
certain
circumstances
just
as
each
man
is
thought
to
have
a
natural
right
to
personal
security
generally
but
not
if
he
is
himself
attempting
to
injure
others
in
life
and
property
so
if
we
may
even
kill
in
defence
of
ourselves
and
others
it
seems
strange
if
we
may
not
lie
if
lying
will
defend
us
better
against
a
palpable
invasion
of
our
rights
and
common
sense
does
not
seem
to
prohibit
this
decisively
and
again
just
as
the
orderly
and
systematic
slaughter
which
we
call
war
is
thought
perfectly
right
under
certain
circumstances
though
painful
and
revolting
so
in
the
of
the
the
lawyer
is
commonly
held
to
be
justified
in
untruthfulness
within
strict
rules
and
limits
for
an
advocate
is
thought
to
be
who
refuses
to
say
what
he
knows
to
be
false
if
he
is
instructed
to
say
it
again
where
deception
is
designed
to
benefit
the
person
deceived
common
sense
seems
to
concede
that
it
may
sometimes
be
right
for
example
most
persons
would
not
hesitate
to
speak
falsely
to
an
invalid
if
this
seemed
the
only
way
of
concealing
facts
that
might
produce
a
dangerous
shock
nor
do
i
perceive
that
any
one
shrinks
from
telling
fictions
to
children
on
matters
upon
which
it
is
thought
well
that
they
should
not
know
the
truth
but
if
the
lawfulness
of
benevolent
deception
in
any
case
be
admitted
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
decide
when
and
how
far
it
is
admissible
except
by
considerations
of
expediency
that
is
by
weighing
the
gain
of
any
particular
deception
against
the
imperilment
of
mutual
confidence
involved
in
all
violation
of
truth
the
much
argued
question
of
religious
deception
pious
fraud
naturally
suggests
itself
here
it
seems
clear
however
that
common
sense
now
pronounces
against
the
broad
rule
that
falsehoods
may
rightly
be
told
in
the
interests
of
religion
but
there
is
a
subtler
form
in
which
the
same
principle
is
still
maintained
by
moral
persons
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
most
important
truths
of
religion
can
not
be
conveyed
into
the
minds
of
ordinary
men
except
by
being
enclosed
as
it
were
in
a
shell
of
fiction
so
that
by
relating
such
fictions
as
if
they
were
facts
we
are
really
performing
an
act
of
substantial
veracity
reflecting
upon
this
argument
we
see
that
it
is
not
after
all
so
clear
wherein
veracity
consists
for
from
the
beliefs
immediately
communicated
by
any
set
of
affirmations
inferences
are
naturally
drawn
and
we
may
clearly
foresee
that
they
will
be
drawn
and
though
commonly
we
intend
that
both
the
beliefs
immediately
communicated
and
the
inferences
drawn
from
them
should
be
true
and
a
person
who
always
aims
at
this
is
praised
as
candid
and
sincere
still
we
find
relaxation
of
the
rule
prescribing
this
intention
claimed
in
two
different
ways
by
at
least
respectable
sections
of
opinion
for
first
as
was
just
now
observed
it
is
sometimes
held
that
if
a
conclusion
is
true
and
important
and
can
not
be
satisfactorily
communicated
otherwise
we
may
lead
the
mind
of
the
hearer
to
it
by
means
of
fictitious
premises
but
the
exact
reverse
of
this
is
perhaps
a
commoner
view
viz
that
it
is
only
an
absolute
duty
to
make
our
actual
affirmations
true
for
it
is
said
that
though
the
ideal
condition
of
human
converse
involves
perfect
sincerity
and
candour
and
we
ought
to
rejoice
in
exhibiting
these
virtues
where
we
can
still
in
our
actual
world
concealment
is
frequently
necessary
to
the
of
society
and
may
be
legitimately
effected
by
any
means
short
of
actual
falsehood
thus
it
is
not
uncommonly
said
that
in
defence
of
a
secret
we
may
not
indeed
produce
directly
beliefs
contrary
to
fact
but
we
may
turn
a
question
aside
produce
indirectly
by
natural
inference
from
our
answer
a
negatively
false
belief
or
throw
the
inquirer
on
a
wrong
scent
produce
similarly
a
positively
false
belief
these
two
methods
of
concealment
are
known
respectively
as
and
and
many
think
them
legitimate
under
certain
circumstances
while
others
say
that
if
deception
is
to
be
practised
at
all
it
is
mere
formalism
to
object
to
any
one
mode
of
effecting
it
more
than
another
on
the
whole
then
reflection
seems
to
show
that
the
rule
of
veracity
as
commonly
accepted
can
not
be
elevated
into
a
definite
moral
axiom
for
there
is
no
real
agreement
as
to
how
far
we
are
bound
to
impart
true
beliefs
to
others
and
while
it
is
contrary
to
common
sense
to
exact
absolute
candour
under
all
circumstances
we
yet
find
no
secondary
principle
clearly
defining
when
it
is
not
to
be
exacted
there
is
however
one
method
of
exhibiting
the
absolute
duty
of
truth
which
we
must
not
overlook
as
if
it
be
valid
it
would
seem
that
the
exceptions
and
qualifications
above
mentioned
have
been
only
admitted
by
common
sense
from
inadvertence
and
shallowness
of
thought
it
is
said
that
if
it
were
once
generally
understood
that
lies
were
justifiable
under
certain
circumstances
it
would
immediately
become
quite
useless
to
tell
the
lies
because
no
one
would
believe
them
and
that
the
moralist
can
not
lay
down
a
rule
which
if
generally
accepted
would
be
suicidal
to
this
there
seem
to
be
three
answers
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
necessarily
an
evil
that
men
s
confidence
in
each
other
s
assertions
should
certain
peculiar
be
impaired
or
destroyed
it
may
even
be
the
very
result
which
we
should
most
desire
to
produce
it
is
obviously
a
most
effective
protection
for
legitimate
secrets
that
it
should
be
universally
understood
and
expected
that
those
who
ask
questions
which
they
have
no
right
to
ask
will
have
lies
told
them
nor
again
should
we
be
restrained
from
pronouncing
it
lawful
to
meet
deceit
with
deceit
merely
by
the
fear
of
impairing
the
security
which
rogues
now
derive
from
the
veracity
of
honest
men
no
doubt
the
ultimate
result
of
general
unveracity
under
the
circumstances
would
be
a
state
of
things
in
which
such
falsehoods
would
no
longer
be
told
but
unless
this
ultimate
result
is
undesirable
the
prospect
of
it
does
not
constitute
a
reason
why
the
falsehoods
should
not
be
told
so
long
as
they
are
useful
but
secondly
since
the
beliefs
of
men
in
general
are
not
formed
purely
on
rational
grounds
experience
shows
that
unveracity
may
long
remain
partially
effective
under
circumstances
where
it
is
generally
understood
to
be
legitimate
we
see
this
in
the
case
of
the
for
though
jurymen
are
perfectly
aware
that
it
is
considered
the
duty
of
an
advocate
to
state
as
plausibly
as
possible
whatever
he
has
been
instructed
to
say
on
behalf
of
any
criminal
he
may
defend
still
a
skilful
pleader
may
often
produce
an
impression
that
he
sincerely
believes
his
client
to
be
innocent
and
it
remains
a
question
of
casuistry
how
far
this
kind
of
hypocrisy
is
justifiable
but
finally
it
can
not
be
assumed
as
certain
that
it
is
never
right
to
act
upon
a
maxim
of
which
the
universal
application
would
be
an
undoubted
evil
this
assumption
may
seem
to
be
involved
in
what
was
previously
admitted
as
an
ethical
axiom
that
what
is
right
for
me
must
be
right
for
all
persons
under
similar
but
reflection
will
show
that
there
is
a
special
case
within
the
range
of
the
axiom
in
which
its
application
is
necessarily
and
excludes
the
practical
universality
which
the
axiom
appears
to
suggest
where
the
agent
s
conditions
include
the
knowledge
that
his
maxim
is
not
universally
accepted
and
a
reasoned
conviction
that
his
act
will
not
tend
to
make
it
so
to
any
important
extent
for
in
this
case
the
axiom
will
practically
only
mean
that
it
will
be
right
for
all
persons
to
do
as
the
agent
does
if
they
are
sincerely
convinced
that
the
act
will
not
be
widely
imitated
and
this
conviction
must
vanish
if
it
widely
imitated
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
these
conditions
are
impossible
and
if
they
are
possible
the
axiom
that
we
are
discussing
can
only
serve
in
its
present
application
to
direct
our
attention
to
an
important
danger
of
unveracity
which
constitutes
a
strong
but
not
formally
conclusive
utilitarian
ground
for
speaking
the
truth
mr
stephen
of
chap
explains
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
as
follows
the
rule
lie
not
is
the
external
rule
and
corresponds
approximately
to
the
internal
rule
be
cases
occur
where
the
rules
diverge
and
in
such
cases
it
is
the
internal
rule
which
is
morally
approved
truthfulness
is
the
rule
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
we
trust
a
man
in
so
far
as
he
speaks
the
truth
in
the
exceptional
cases
the
mutual
confidence
would
be
violated
when
the
truth
not
when
the
lie
is
this
explanation
seems
to
me
for
several
reasons
inadequate
if
we
may
sometimes
lie
to
defend
the
life
or
secrets
of
others
it
is
paradoxical
to
say
that
we
may
not
do
so
to
defend
our
own
but
a
falsehood
in
obviously
can
not
be
justified
as
an
application
of
the
maxim
be
even
when
the
falsehood
is
in
legitimate
defence
of
others
against
attacks
we
can
not
say
that
the
speaker
manifests
trustworthiness
without
qualification
for
the
deceived
assailant
trusts
his
veracity
otherwise
he
would
not
be
deceived
the
question
therefore
is
under
what
circumstances
the
confidence
of
that
i
shall
speak
the
truth
may
legitimately
be
disappointed
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
confidence
of
that
i
shall
defend
his
life
and
honour
this
question
stephen
s
explanation
does
not
in
any
way
aid
us
to
answer
the
general
question
raised
by
stephen
as
to
the
value
of
internal
rules
expressed
in
the
form
be
this
in
contrast
to
external
rules
expressed
in
the
form

this
will
be
dealt
with
in
a
subsequent
chapter

the
case
where
set
forms
are
used
being
the
probans
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
advocate
merely
the
false
affirmations
of
others
since
the
whole
force
of
his
pleading
depends
upon
his
adopting
them
and
working
them
up
into
a
view
of
the
case
which
for
the
time
at
least
he
appears
to
hold
certain
religious
persons
hold
or
held
in
that
it
is
right
solemnly
to
affirm
a
belief
that
god
created
the
world
in
days
and
rested
on
the

other
social
duties
and
virtues
when
we
proceed
to
inquire
how
far
the
minor
social
duties
and
virtues
recognised
by
common
sense
appear
on
examination
to
be
anything
more
than
special
applications
of
the
benevolence
general
or
particular
discussed
in
chap
the
department
of
duty
which
most
prominently
claims
our
attention
is
that
which
deals
with
the
existence
and
determines
the
legitimacy
of
feelings
antithetical
to
the
benevolent
for
it
seems
that
malevolent
affections
are
as
natural
to
man
as
the
benevolent
not
indeed
in
the
same
sense
for
man
tends
to
have
normally
some
kindly
feeling
for
any
when
there
is
no
special
cause
operating
to
make
him
love
or
hate
though
this
tendency
is
obscured
in
the
lower
stages
of
social
development
by
the
habitual
hostility
between
strange
tribes
and
races
but
still
such
special
causes
of
malevolent
feeling
continually
occur
and
in
the
main
exemplify
a
psychological
law
analogous
to
that
by
which
the
growth
of
benevolent
feelings
is
explained
for
just
as
we
are
apt
to
love
those
who
are
the
cause
of
pleasure
to
us
whether
by
voluntary
benefits
or
otherwise
so
by
strict
analogy
we
naturally
dislike
those
who
have
done
us
harm
either
consciously
from
malevolence
or
mere
selfishness
or
even
unconsciously
as
when
another
man
is
an
obstacle
to
our
attainment
of
a
end
thus
we
naturally
feel
to
a
rival
who
deprives
us
of
an
object
of
competition
and
so
in
persons
in
whom
the
desire
of
superiority
is
strong
a
certain
dislike
of
any
one
who
is
more
successful
or
prosperous
than
themselves
is
easily
aroused
and
this
envy
however
repulsive
to
our
moral
sense
seems
as
natural
as
any
other
malevolent
emotion
and
it
is
to
be
observed
that
each
of
the
elements
into
which
we
can
analyse
malevolent
affection
finds
its
exact
counterpart
in
the
analysis
of
the
benevolent
as
the
former
includes
a
dislike
of
the
presence
of
its
object
and
a
desire
to
inflict
pain
on
it
and
also
a
capacity
of
deriving
pleasure
from
the
pain
thus
inflicted
if
now
we
ask
how
far
indulgence
of
malevolent
emotions
is
right
and
proper
the
answer
of
common
sense
is
not
easy
to
formulate
for
some
would
say
broadly
that
they
ought
to
be
repressed
altogether
or
as
far
as
possible
and
no
doubt
we
blame
all
envy
though
sometimes
to
exclude
it
altogether
requires
a
magnanimity
which
we
praise
and
we
regard
as
virtues
or
natural
excellences
the
which
prevents
one
from
feeling
even
pain
to
a
material
extent
not
to
say
resentment
from
trifling
annoyances
inflicted
by
others
the
which
does
not
resent
even
graver
injuries
the
and
which
refrain
from
retaliating
them
and
the
which
accords
forgiveness
rapidly
and
easily
we
are
even
accustomed
to
praise
the
which
spares
even
deserved
punishment
because
though
we
never
exactly
disapprove
of
the
infliction
of
deserved
punishment
and
hold
it
to
be
generally
a
duty
of
government
and
in
certain
cases
of
private
persons
to
inflict
it
we
do
not
think
that
this
duty
admits
of
no
exceptions
we
think
that
in
exceptional
cases
considerations
not
strictly
relevant
to
the
question
of
justice
may
be
properly
regarded
as
reasons
for
remitting
punishment
and
we
admire
the
sympathetic
nature
that
eagerly
avails
itself
of
these
legitimate
occasions
for
remission
on
the
other
hand
common
sense
admits
instinctive
resentment
for
wrong
to
be
legitimate
and
proper
and
even
a
more
sustained
and
deliberate
malevolence
is
commonly
approved
as
virtuous
indignation
the
problem
then
is
how
to
reconcile
these
diverse
approvals
even
as
regards
external
duty
there
is
some
difficulty
since
though
it
is
clear
to
common
sense
that
in
a
society
punishment
of
adults
ought
generally
to
be
inflicted
by
government
and
that
a
private
individual
wronged
ought
not
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
still
there
are
in
all
societies
injuries
to
individuals
which
the
law
does
not
punish
at
all
or
not
adequately
and
for
which
effective
requital
is
often
possible
without
transgressing
the
limits
of
legality
and
there
seems
to
be
no
clear
agreement
as
to
the
right
manner
of
dealing
with
these
for
the
christian
code
is
widely
thought
to
prescribe
a
complete
and
absolute
forgiveness
of
such
offences
and
many
christians
have
endeavoured
to
carry
out
this
rule
by
dismissing
the
offences
as
far
as
possible
from
their
minds
or
at
least
allowing
the
memory
of
them
to
have
no
effect
on
their
outward
conduct
few
however
would
deny
that
so
far
as
a
wrong
done
to
me
gives
ground
for
expecting
future
mischief
from
the
offender
to
myself
or
to
others
i
am
bound
as
a
rational
being
to
take
due
precautions
against
this
future
mischief
and
probably
most
would
admit
that
such
precautions
for
the
future
in
the
case
we
are
considering
may
include
the
infliction
of
punishment
for
the
past
where
impunity
would
give
a
dangerous
temptation
to
a
repetition
of
the
unpunished
offence
if
we
ask
therefore
how
far
forgiveness
is
practically
possible
the
answer
seems
admittedly
to
depend
on
two
considerations
how
far
the
punishment
to
which
resentment
prompts
is
really
required
in
the
interests
of
society
and
how
far
if
so
it
will
be
adequately
inflicted
if
the
person
wronged
refrains
from
inflicting
it
but
obviously
so
far
as
we
allow
the
question
to
be
settled
by
these
considerations
we
are
introducing
a
method
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
utilitarian
and
we
seem
led
to
a
similar
result
in
discussing
the
legitimacy
of
malevolent
feeling
here
again
we
find
much
disagreement
among
thoughtful
persons
for
many
would
say
that
though
the
emotion
of
anger
is
legitimate
it
ought
to
be
directed
always
against
wrong
acts
as
such
and
not
against
the
agent
for
even
where
the
anger
may
legitimately
prompt
us
to
punish
him
it
ought
never
to
overcome
our
kindly
feeling
towards
him
and
certainly
if
this
state
of
mind
is
possible
it
seems
the
simplest
reconciliation
of
the
general
maxim
of
benevolence
with
the
admitted
duty
of
inflicting
punishment
on
the
other
hand
it
is
urged
with
some
reason
that
to
retain
a
genuine
kindly
feeling
towards
a
man
while
we
are
gratifying
a
strong
impulse
of
aversion
to
his
acts
by
inflicting
pain
on
him
requires
a
subtle
complexity
of
emotion
too
far
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
men
to
be
prescribed
as
a
duty
and
that
we
must
allow
as
right
and
proper
a
temporary
suspension
of
benevolence
towards
until
they
have
been
punished
some
again
make
a
distinction
between
instinctive
and
deliberate
resentment
saying
that
the
former
is
legitimate
in
so
far
as
it
is
required
for
the
of
individuals
and
the
repression
of
mutual
violence
but
that
deliberate
resentment
is
not
similarly
needed
for
if
we
act
deliberately
we
can
act
from
a
better
motive
others
however
think
that
a
deliberate
and
sustained
desire
to
punish
is
required
in
the
interests
of
society
since
the
mere
desire
to
realise
justice
will
not
practically
be
strong
enough
to
repress
offences
and
that
it
is
as
serious
a
mistake
to
attempt
to
substitute
the
desire
of
justice
for
natural
resentment
as
it
would
be
to
substitute
prudence
for
natural
appetite
in
eating
and
drinking
or
mere
dutifulness
for
filial
affection
again
a
distinction
may
be
taken
between
the
impulse
to
inflict
pain
and
the
desire
of
the
antipathetic
pleasure
which
the
agent
will
reap
from
this
infliction
so
that
while
we
approve
the
former
under
certain
circumstances
we
may
still
regard
the
latter
as
altogether
inadmissible
it
would
seem
however
that
a
man
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
of
resentment
can
hardly
exclude
from
his
mind
altogether
an
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
that
he
will
feel
when
the
passion
is
gratified
and
if
so
he
can
hardly
exclude
altogether
the
desire
of
this
gratification
if
therefore
it
is
important
for
the
of
society
that
men
should
derive
hearty
satisfaction
from
the
punishment
of
a
nefarious
criminal
it
is
perhaps
going
too
far
to
prohibit
absolutely
the
desire
of
this
satisfaction
though
we
may
say
that
a
man
ought
not
to
cherish
this
desire
and
gloat
over
the
anticipated
pleasure
on
the
whole
we
may
perhaps
sum
up
by
saying
that
a
superficial
view
of
the
matter
naturally
leads
us
to
condemn
sweepingly
all
malevolent
feelings
and
the
acts
to
which
they
prompt
as
contrary
to
the
general
duty
of
benevolence
but
that
the
common
sense
of
reflective
persons
recognises
the
necessity
of
relaxing
this
rule
in
the
interests
of
society
only
it
is
not
clear
as
to
the
limits
or
principles
of
this
relaxation
though
inclined
to
let
it
be
determined
by
considerations
of
expediency
the
remaining
virtues
that
are
clearly
and
exclusively
social
will
be
easily
seen
to
have
no
independent
maxims
the
conduct
in
which
they
are
respectively
realised
being
merely
the
fulfilment
under
special
conditions
of
the
rules
already
discussed
we
need
not
then
enter
upon
an
exhaustive
examination
of
these
minor
virtues
for
it
is
not
our
object
to
frame
a
complete
glossary
of
ethical
terms
but
for
illustration
s
sake
it
may
be
well
to
discuss
one
or
two
of
them
and
i
will
select
for
examination
liberality
with
its
cognate
notions
partly
on
account
of
the
prominence
that
it
has
had
in
the
earlier
ages
of
thought
and
partly
because
of
a
certain
complexity
in
the
feelings
with
which
it
is
usually
regarded
considered
as
a
virtue
liberality
seems
to
be
merely
benevolence
as
exhibited
in
the
particular
service
of
giving
money
beyond
the
limits
of
strict
duty
as
commonly
recognised
for
in
so
far
as
it
can
be
called
a
duty
to
be
liberal
it
is
because
in
the
performance
of
the
more
or
less
indefinite
duties
enumerated
in
chap
iv
we
do
not
like
exactness
to
be
sought
a
certain
excess
is
needful
if
the
duty
is
to
be
well
done
and
perhaps
in
the
case
of
the
poor
this
graceful
excess
is
excluded
by
prudence
for
though
a
poor
man
might
make
a
great
sacrifice
in
a
small
gift
we
should
call
this
generous
but
scarcely
liberal
liberality
appears
to
require
an
external
abundance
in
the
gift
even
more
than
a
disposition
it
seems
therefore
to
be
possible
only
to
the
rich
and
as
i
have
hinted
in
the
admiration
commonly
accorded
to
it
there
seems
to
be
mingled
an
element
rather
æsthetic
than
moral
for
we
are
all
apt
to
admire
power
and
we
recognise
the
latent
power
of
wealth
gracefully
exhibited
in
a
certain
degree
of
careless
profusion
when
the
object
is
to
give
happiness
to
others
indeed
the
vulgar
admire
the
same
carelessness
as
manifested
even
in
selfish
luxury
the
sphere
of
liberality
then
lies
generally
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
indefinite
duties
of
benevolence
but
there
is
a
certain
borderground
between
justice
and
benevolence
where
it
is
especially
shown
namely
in
the
full
satisfaction
of
all
customary
expectations
even
when
indefinite
and
uncertain
as
in
the
remuneration
of
services
in
so
far
as
this
is
governed
by
custom
and
even
where
it
is
left
entirely
to
free
contract
and
therefore
naturally
determined
by
haggling
and
bargaining
as
market
value
generally
it
is
characteristic
of
a
liberal
man
to
avoid
this
haggling
and
to
give
somewhat
higher
remuneration
than
the
other
party
might
be
induced
to
take
and
similarly
to
take
for
his
own
services
a
somewhat
lower
payment
than
he
might
persuade
the
other
to
give
and
again
since
laws
and
promises
and
especially
tacit
understandings
are
sometimes
doubtful
and
ambiguous
a
liberal
man
will
in
such
cases
unhesitatingly
adopt
the
interpretation
which
is
least
in
his
own
favour
and
pay
the
most
that
he
can
by
any
fairminded
person
be
thought
to
owe
and
exact
the
least
that
reasonably
can
be
thought
to
be
due
to
himself
that
is
if
the
margin
be
relatively
to
his
resources
not
considerable
and
of
a
man
who
does
the
opposite
of
all
this
we
predicate
meanness
this
being
the
vice
antithetical
to
liberality
here
again
there
seems
no
place
for
this
particular
vice
if
the
amount
at
stake
be
considerable
for
then
we
think
it
not
mean
to
exact
one
s
own
rights
to
the
full
and
worse
than
mean
to
refuse
another
what
he
ought
to
have
in
fact
in
such
cases
we
think
that
any
indefiniteness
as
to
rights
should
be
practically
removed
by
the
decision
of
a
judge
or
arbitrator
the
vice
of
meanness
then
is
we
may
say
bounded
on
the
side
of
vice
by
injustice
the
mean
man
is
blamed
not
for
violation
of
justice
but
because
he
chooses
a
trifling
gain
to
himself
rather
than
the
avoidance
of
disappointment
to
others
and
here
again
it
should
be
observed
an
element
not
strictly
moral
is
included
in
the
common
disapprobation
of
meanness
for
as
we
have
seen
a
certain
carelessness
of
money
is
admired
as
a
sign
of
power
and
superiority
and
the
opposite
habit
is
a
symbol
of
inferiority
the
mean
man
then
is
apt
to
be
despised
as
having
the
bad
taste
to
show
this
symbol
needlessly
preferring
a
little
gain
to
the
respect
of
his
meanness
however
has
a
wider
sphere
than
liberality
and
refers
not
merely
to
the
taking
or
refusing
of
money
but
to
taking
advantages
generally
in
this
wider
sense
the
opposite
virtue
is
generosity
in
so
far
as
the
sphere
of
generosity
coincides
with
that
of
liberality
the
former
seems
partly
to
transcend
the
latter
partly
to
refer
more
to
feelings
than
to
outward
acts
and
to
imply
a
completer
triumph
of
unselfish
over
selfish
impulses
in
the
wider
sense
it
is
strikingly
exhibited
in
conflict
and
competition
of
all
kinds
here
it
is
sometimes
called
chivalry
reflection
shows
us
that
the
essence
of
this
beautiful
virtue
is
the
realisation
of
benevolence
under
circumstances
which
make
it
peculiarly
difficult
and
therefore
peculiarly
admirable
for
generosity
or
chivalry
towards
adversaries
or
competitors
seems
to
consist
in
showing
as
much
kindness
and
regard
for
their
as
is
compatible
with
the
ends
and
conditions
of
conflict
one
prominent
form
of
this
being
the
endeavour
to
realise
ideal
justice
in
these
conditions
not
merely
by
observing
all
the
rules
and
tacit
understandings
under
which
the
conflict
is
conducted
but
by
resigning
even
accidental
advantages
such
resignation
however
is
not
considered
a
strict
duty
nor
is
there
any
agreement
as
to
how
far
it
is
right
and
virtuous
for
what
some
would
praise
and
approve
others
would
regard
as
quixotic
and
extravagant
to
sum
up
we
may
say
that
the
terms
liberality
and
generosity
so
far
as
they
are
strictly
ethical
denote
the
virtue
of
benevolence
perhaps
including
justice
to
some
extent
as
exhibited
in
special
ways
and
under
special
conditions
and
the
examination
of
the
other
minor
social
virtues
would
evidently
lead
to
similar
general
results
though
it
might
not
always
be
easy
to
agree
on
their
definitions
footnotes
it
is
to
be
observed
that
men
derive
pleasure
from
the
pains
and
losses
of
others
in
various
ways
without
the
specific
emotion
which
i
distinguish
as
malevolent
affection
either
from
the
sense
of
power
exercised
which
explains
much
of
the
wanton
cruelty
of
schoolboys
despots

from
a
sense
of
their

superiority

security
in
contrast
with
the
failures

struggles

others

excitement

strong
feeling

one
but
these
facts
though
psychologically
interesting

inflicted

such
motives

chapter
ix
virtues
i
conceive
that
according
to
the
morality
of
common
sense
an
ultimate
harmony
between
and
virtue
is
assumed
or
postulated
so
that
the
performance
of
duty
and
cultivation
of
virtue
generally
may
be
regarded
as
a
duty
to
self
as
being
always
conducive
to
the
agent
s
true
interest
and
but
further
common
sense
in
modern
europe
recognises
a
strict
duty
of
preserving
one
s
own
life
even
when
the
prospect
life
offers
is
one
in
which
pain
preponderates
over
pleasure
it
is
indeed
held
to
be
right
and
praiseworthy
to
encounter
certain
death
in
the
performance
of
strict
duty
or
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
another
or
for
any
very
important
gain
to
society
but
not
merely
in
order
to
avoid
pain
to
the
agent
at
the
same
time
within
the
limits
fixed
by
this
and
other
duties
common
sense

i
think
that
it
is
a
duty
to
seek
our
own
happiness
except
in
so
far
as
we
can
promote
the
welfare
of
others
by
sacrificing
it
this
due
concern
about
our
own
interest
or
happiness
may
be
called
the
duty
of
prudence
it
should
however
be
observed
that
since
it
is
less
evident
that
men
do
not
adequately
desire
their
own
greatest
good
than
that
their
efforts
are
not
sufficiently
well
directed
to
its
attainment
in
conceiving
prudence
as
a
virtue
or
excellence
attention
is
often
fixed
almost
exclusively
on
its
intellectual
side
thus
regarded
prudence
may
be
said
to
be
merely
wisdom
made
more
definite
by
the
acceptance
of
as
its
sole
ultimate
end
the
habit
of
calculating
carefully
the
best
means
to
the
attainment
of
our
own
interest
and
resisting
all
irrational
impulses
which
may
tend
to
perturb
our
calculations
or
prevent
us
from
acting
on
them
there
are
however
current
notions
of
particular
virtues
which
might
be
called
but
yet
with
respect
to
which
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
they
are
merely
particular
applications
of
prudence
or
whether
they
have
independent
maxims
of
these
temperance
one
of
the
four
cardinal
virtues
anciently
recognised
seems
the
most
prominent
in
its
ordinary
use
temperance
is
the
habit
of
controlling
the
principal
appetites
or
desires
which
have
an
immediate
corporeal
cause
the
habit
of
moderating
and
controlling
our
desires
generally
is
recognised
by
common
sense
as
useful
and
desirable
but
with
less
distinctness
and
emphasis
all
are
agreed
that
our
appetites
need
control
but
in
order
to
establish
a
maxim
of
temperance
we
have
to
determine
within
what
limits
on
what
principle
and
to
what
end
they
ought
to
be
controlled
now
in
the
case
of
the
appetites
for
food
drink
sleep
stimulants
no
one
doubts
that
bodily
health
and
vigour
is
the
end
naturally
subserved
by
their
gratification
and
that
the
latter
ought
to
be
checked
whenever
it
tends
to
defeat
this
end
including
in
the
notion
of
health
the
most
perfect
condition
of
the
mental
faculties
so
far
as
this
appears
to
depend
upon
the
general
state
of
the
body
and
further
the
indulgence
of
a
bodily
appetite
is
manifestly
imprudent
if
it
involves
the
loss
of
any
greater
gratification
of
whatever
kind
and
otherwise
wrong
if
it
interferes
with
the
performance
of
duties
though
it
is
perhaps
doubtful
how
far
this
latter
indulgence
would
commonly
be
condemned
as
some
however
deduce
from
the
obvious
truth
that
the
maintenance
of
bodily
health
is
the
chief
natural
end
of
the
appetites
a
more
rigid
rule
of
restraint
and
one
that
goes
beyond
prudence
they
say
that
this
end
ought
to
fix
not
only
the
negative
but
the
positive
limit
of
indulgence
that
the
pleasure
derived
from
the
gratification
of
appetite
should
never
be
sought
even
when
it
does
not
impair
health
or
interfere
with
duty
or
with
a
greater
pleasure
of
a
different
kind
but
only
in
so
far
as
such
gratification
is
positively
conducive
to
health
when
we
consider
to
what
a
marked
divergence
from
the
usual
habits
of
the
moral
rich
this
principle
would
lead
we
might
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
is
clearly
at
variance
with
common
sense
but
it
often
meets
with
verbal
assent
there
is
again
a
third
and
intermediate
view
which
accepts
the
principle
that
the
gratification
of
appetite
is
not
to
be
sought
for
its
own
sake
but
admits
other
ends
as
legitimate
besides
the
mere
maintenance
of
health
and
strength
cheerfulness
and
the
cultivation
of
the
social
some
such
principle
seems
to
be
more
or
less
consciously
held
by
many
persons
hence
we
find
that
solitary
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
is
very
frequently
regarded
with
something
like
moral
aversion
and
that
the
banquets
which
are
given
and
enjoyed
by
moral
persons
are
vaguely
supposed
to
have
for
their
end
not
the
common
indulgence
of
sensual
appetites
but
the
promotion
of
conviviality
and
conversational
entertainment
for
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
enjoyment
in
common
of
a
luxurious
meal
develops
social
emotions
and
also
stimulates
the
faculties
of
wit
and
humour
and
lively
colloquy
in
general
and
feasts
which
are
obviously
not
contrived
with
a
view
to
such
convivial
and
colloquial
gratifications
seem
to
be
condemned
by
refined
persons
still
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
state
as
a
maxim
supported
by
common
sense
in
respect
of
sensual
pleasures
generally
that
they
are
never
to
be
sought
except
they
positively
promote
those
of
a
higher
kind
in
the
last
section
we
have
spoken
chiefly
of
the
appetites
for
food
and
drink
it
is
however
in
the
case
of
the
appetite
of
sex
that
the
regulation
morally
prescribed
most
clearly
and
definitely
transcends
that
of
mere
prudence
which
is
indicated
by
the
special
notion
of
purity
or
chastity
at
first
sight
it
may
perhaps
appear
that
the
regulation
of
the
sexual
appetite
prescribed
by
the
received
moral
code
merely
confines
its
indulgence
within
the
limits
of
the
union
sanctioned
by
law
only
that
here
as
the
natural
impulse
is
peculiarly
powerful
and
easily
excited
it
is
especially
necessary
to
prohibit
any
acts
internal
as
well
as
external
that
tend
even
indirectly
to
the
transgression
of
these
limits
and
this
is
to
a
great
extent
true
still
on
reflection
it
will
appear
i
think
that
our
common
notion
of
purity
implies
a
standard
independent
of
law
for
first
conformity
to
this
does
not
necessarily
secure
purity
and
secondly
all
illegitimate
sexual
intercourse
is
not
thought
to
be
impure
and
it
is
only
by
inadvertence
that
the
two
notions
are
sometimes
confounded
but
it
is
not
very
clear
what
this
standard
is
for
when
we
interrogate
the
moral
consciousness
of
mankind
we
seem
to
find
two
views
a
stricter
and
a
laxer
analogous
to
the
two
interpretations
of
temperance
last
noticed
it
is
agreed
that
the
sexual
appetite
ought
never
to
be
indulged
for
the
sake
of
the
sensual
gratification
merely
but
as
a
means
to
some
higher
end
but
some
say
that
the
propagation
of
the
species
is
the
only
legitimate
as
it
is
obviously
the
primary
natural
end
while
others
regard
the
development
of
mutual
affection
in
a
union
designed
to
be
permanent
as
an
end
perfectly
admissible
and
right
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
practical
difference
between
the
two
views
is
considerable
so
that
this
question
is
one
which
it
is
necessary
to
raise
and
decide
but
it
may
be
observed
that
any
attempt
to
lay
down
minute
and
detailed
rules
on
this
subject
seems
to
be
condemned
by
common
sense
as
tending
to
defeat
the
end
of
purity
as
such
minuteness
of
moral
legislation
invites
men
in
general
to
exercise
their
thoughts
on
this
subject
to
an
extent
which
is
practically
dangerous
i
ought
to
point
out
that
the
virtue
of
purity
is
certainly
not
merely
and
is
therefore
properly
out
of
place
in
this
chapter
but
the
convenience
of
discussing
it
along
with
temperance
has
led
me
to
take
it
out
of
its
natural
order
some
however
would
go
further
and
say
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
distinctly
social
virtue
for
the
propagation
and
rearing
of
children
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
social
interests
and
they
would
maintain
that
purity
merely
connotes
a
sentiment
protective
of
these
important
functions
supporting
the
rules
which
we
consider
necessary
to
secure
their
proper
performance
but
it
seems
clear
that
though
common
sense
undoubtedly
recognises
this
tendency
of
the
sentiment
of
purity
to
maintain
the
best
possible
provision
for
the
continuance
of
the
human
race
it
still
does
not
regard
that
as
the
fundamental
point
in
the
definition
of
this
rule
of
duty
and
the
sole
criterion
in
deciding
whether
acts
do
or
do
not
violate
the
rule
there
seem
to
be
no
similar
special
questions
with
respect
to
most
other
desires
we
recognise
no
doubt
a
general
duty
of
but
this
is
merely
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
acting
rationally
whatever
our
interpretation
of
rational
action
may
be
it
only
prescribes
that
we
should
yield
to
no
impulse
which
prompts
us
to
act
in
antagonism
to
ends
or
rules
deliberately
accepted
further
there
is
a
certain
tendency
among
moral
persons
to
the
ascetic
opinion
that
the
gratification
of
merely
sensual
impulse
is
in
itself
somewhat
objectionable
but
this
view
does
not
seem
to
be
taken
by
common
sense
in
particular
cases
we
do
not
commonly
condemn
the
most
intense
enjoyment
of
muscular
exercise
or
warmth
or
bathing
the
only
other
case
besides
that
of
the
appetites
above
discussed
in
which
the
common
sense
of
our
age
and
country
seems
to
regard
as
right
or
admirable
the
repression
of
natural
impulses
beyond
what
prudence
and
benevolence
would
dictate
is
that
of
the
promptings
of
pain
and
fear
an
important
instance
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
rule
prohibiting
suicide
absolutely
even
in
face
of
the
strongest
probability
that
the
rest
of
a
man
s
life
will
be
both
miserable
and
burdensome
to
others
but
in
other
cases
also
praise
is
apparently
bestowed
on
endurance
of
pain
and
danger
beyond
what
is
conducive
to
happiness
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
in
the
next
chapter

kant

that
as
every
one
inevitably
wills
means
to
promote
his
own

this
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
duty
but
as
i

iv
a
man
does
not
inevitably

to
do
what
he
believes

be

conducive

the
view
in
the
text
is
that
of
butler
dissertation
the
nature
of
who
admits
that
nature
has
not
given
us
so
sensible
a
disapprobation
of
imprudence
and
folly
as
of
falsehood
injustice
and
cruelty
but
points
out
that
such
sensible
disapprobation
is
for
various
reasons
less
needed
in
the
former
case
see

s

chap
x
the
notion
of
chastity
is
nearly
equivalent
to
that
of
purity
only
somewhat
more
external
and
superficial
in
so
far
as
mere
illegitimacy
of
union
is
conceived
to
be
directly
and
specially
prohibited
and
not
merely
from
considerations
of
prudence
and
benevolence
it
is
regarded
as
a
violation
of
order
rather
than
of
purity
it
was
partly
owing
to
the
serious
oversight
of
not
perceiving
that
purity
itself
forbids
too
minute
a
system
of
rules
for
the
observance
of
purity
that
the
mediæval
casuistry
fell
into
disrepute
chapter
x
courage
humility
etc
besides
the
virtue
of
purity
which
we
found
it
convenient
to
discuss
in
the
last
chapter
there
remain
one
or
two
prominent
excellences
of
character
which
do
not
seem
to
be
commonly
admired
and
inculcated
with
any
distinct
reference
either
to
private
or
to
general
happiness
and
which
though
in
most
cases
obviously
conducive
to
one
or
other
of
these
ends
sometimes
seem
to
influence
conduct
in
a
direction
at
variance
with
them
for
example
courage
is
a
quality
which
excites
general
admiration
whether
it
is
shown
in
or
in
aiding
others
or
even
when
we
do
not
see
any
benefit
resulting
from
the
particular
exhibition
of
it
again
in
christian
societies
humility
if
believed
sincere
often
obtains
unqualified
praise
in
spite
of
the
loss
that
may
evidently
result
from
a
man
s
underrating
his
own
abilities
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
examine
how
far
in
either
case
we
can
elicit
a
clear
and
independent
maxim
defining
the
conduct
commended
under
each
of
these
notions
to
begin
with
courage
we
generally
denote
by
this
term
a
disposition
to
face
danger
of
any
kind
without
shrinking
we
sometimes
also
call
those
who
bear
pain
unflinchingly
courageous
but
this
quality
of
character
we
more
commonly
distinguish
as
fortitude
now
it
seems
plain
that
if
we
seek
for
a
definition
of
as
commonly
recognised
under
the
head
either
of
courage
or
of
fortitude
we
can
find
none
that
does
not
involve
a
reference
to
other
maxims
and
ends
for
no
one
would
say
that
it
is
our
to
face
danger
or
to
bear
avoidable
pain
generally
but
only
if
it
meets
us
in
the
course
of
duty
and
even
this
needs
further
qualification
for
as
regards
such
duties
as
those
of
general
benevolence
it
would
be
commonly
allowed
that
the
agent
s
pain
and
danger
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
practically
determining
their
extent
it
would
be
held
that
we
are
not
bound
to
endure
any
pain
except
for
the
prevention
of
manifestly
greater
pain
to
another
or
the
attainment
of
a
more
important
amount
of
positive
good
nor
to
run
any
risk
unless
the
chance
of
additional
benefit
to
be
gained
for
another
outweighs
the
cost
and
chance
of
loss
to
ourselves
if
we
fail
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
common
estimate
of
the
duty
of
benevolence
could
be
said
to
amount
quite
to
this
when
however
we
consider
courage
as
an
excellence
rather
than
a
duty
it
seems
to
hold
a
more
independent
position
in
our
moral
estimation
and
this
view
corresponds
more
completely
than
the
other
to
the
common
application
of
the
notion
as
there
are
many
acts
of
courage
which
are
not
altogether
within
the
control
of
the
will
and
therefore
can
not
be
regarded
as
strict
duties
for
danger
is
frequently
sudden
and
needs
to
be
met
without
deliberation
so
that
our
manner
of
meeting
it
can
only
be
and
though
naturally
timid
persons
can
perhaps
with
effort
control
fear
as
they
can
anger
or
appetite
if
time
be
allowed
for
deliberation
and
can
prevent
it
from
taking
effect
in
dereliction
of
duty
still
this
result
is
not
all
that
is
required
for
the
performance
of
such
courageous
acts
as
need
more
than
ordinary
energy
for
the
energy
of
the
timid
virtuous
man
is
liable
to
be
exhausted
in
the
effort
to
control
his
fear
in
battle
he
can
perhaps
stand
still
to
be
killed
as
well
as
the
courageous
man
but
not
charge
with
the
same
impetuosity
or
strike
with
the
same
vigour
and
precision
so
far
then
as
courage
is
not
completely
voluntary
we
have
to
consider
whether
it
is
a
desirable
quality
rather
than
whether
we
are
strictly
bound
to
exhibit
it
and
here
there
seems
no
doubt
that
we
commonly
find
it
morally
admirable
without
reference
to
any
end
served
by
it
and
when
the
dangers
which
call
it
forth
might
be
avoided
without
any
dereliction
of
duty
at
the
same
time
we
call
a
man
foolhardy
who
runs
unnecessarily
into
danger
beyond
a
certain
degree
where
then
is
the
limit
to
be
fixed
on
utilitarian
principles
we
should
endeavour
to
strike
as
exact
a
balance
as
possible
between
the
amount
of
danger
incurred
in
any
case
and
the
probable
benefit
of
cultivating
and
developing
by
practice
a
habit
so
frequently
necessary
for
the
due
performance
of
important
duties
this
will
obviously
give
a
different
result
for
different
states
of
society
and
different
callings
and
professions
as
most
people
need
this
instinctive
courage
less
in
civilised
societies
than
in
ones
and
civilians
less
than
soldiers
perhaps
the
instinctive
admiration
of
mankind
for
acts
of
daring
does
not
altogether
observe
this
limit
but
we
may
say
i
think
that
in
so
far
as
it
attempts
to
justify
itself
on
reflection
it
is
commonly
in
some
such
way
as
this
and
common
sense
does
not
seem
to
point
to
any
limit
depending
on
a
different
principle
as
the
virtue
of
courage
is
prominent
in
pagan
ethics
and
in
the
code
of
honour
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
survival
of
the
pagan
view
of
morality
so
humility
especially
belongs
to
the
ideal
set
before
mankind
by
christianity
the
common
account
however
of
this
virtue
is
somewhat
paradoxical
for
it
is
generally
said
that
humility
prescribes
a
low
opinion
of
our
own
merits
but
if
our
merits
are
comparatively
high
it
seems
strange
to
direct
us
to
have
a
low
opinion
of
them
it
may
be
replied
that
though
our
merits
may
be
high
when
compared
with
those
of
ordinary
men
there
are
always
some
to
be
found
superior
and
we
can
compare
ourselves
with
these
and
in
the
extreme
case
with
ideal
excellence
of
which
all
fall
far
short
and
that
we
ought
to
make
this
kind
of
comparison
and
not
the
other
kind
and
contemplate
our
faults
of
which
we
shall
assuredly
find
a
sufficiency
and
not
our
merits
but
surely
in
the
most
important
deliberations
which
human
life
offers
in
determining
what
kind
of
work
we
shall
undertake
and
to
what
social
functions
we
shall
aspire
it
is
often
necessary
that
we
should
compare
our
qualifications
carefully
with
those
of
average
men
if
we
are
to
decide
rightly
and
it
would
seem
just
as
irrational
to
underrate
ourselves
as
to
overrate
and
though
most
men
are
more
prone
to
the
latter
mistake
there
are
certainly
some
rather
inclined
to
the
former
i
think
that
if
we
reflect
carefully
on
the
common
judgments
in
which
the
notion
of
humility
is
used
we
shall
find
that
the
quality
commonly
under
this
name
which
is
not
always
used
eulogistically
is
not
properly
regulative
of
the
opinions
we
form
of
ourselves
for
here
as
in
other
opinions
we
ought
to
aim
at
nothing
but
truth
but
tends
to
the
repression
of
two
different
seductive
emotions
one
entirely
the
other
relating
to
others
and
partly
taking
effect
in
social
behaviour
partly
the
virtue
of
humility
is
manifested
in
repressing
the
emotion
of
which
springs
naturally
from
the
contemplation
of
our
own
merits
and
as
it
is
highly
agreeable
prompts
to
such
contemplation
this
admiring
is
generally
condemned
but
not
i
think
by
an
intuition
that
claims
to
be
ultimate
as
it
is
commonly
justified
by
the
reason
that
such
even
if
tends
to
check
our
progress
towards
higher
virtue
the
mere
fact
of
our
feeling
this
admiration
is
thought
to
be
evidence
that
we
have
not
sufficiently
compared
ourselves
with
our
ideal
or
that
our
ideal
is
not
sufficiently
high
and
it
is
thought
to
be
indispensable
to
moral
progress
that
we
should
have
a
high
ideal
and
should
continually
contemplate
it
at
the
same
time
we
obviously
need
some
care
in
the
application
of
this
maxim
for
all
admit
that
is
an
important
auxiliary
to
right
conduct
and
moralists
continually
point
to
the
satisfactions
of
a
good
conscience
as
part
of
the
natural
reward
which
providence
has
attached
to
virtue
yet
it
is
difficult
to
separate
the
glow
of
which
attends
the
performance
of
a
virtuous
action
from
the
complacent
which
humility
seems
to
exclude
perhaps
we
may
say
that
the
feeling
of
itself
is
natural
and
a
legitimate
pleasure
but
that
if
prolonged
and
fostered
it
is
liable
to
impede
moral
progress
and
that
what
humility
prescribes
is
such
repression
of
as
will
tend
on
the
whole
to
promote
this
end
on
this
view
the
maxim
of
humility
is
clearly
a
dependent
one
the
end
to
which
it
is
subordinate
is
progress
in
virtue
generally
as
for
such
pride
and
as
are
based
not
on
our
own
conduct
and
its
results
but
on
external
and
accidental
advantages
these
are
condemned
as
involving
a
false
and
absurd
view
as
to
the
nature
of
real
merit
but
we
not
only
take
pleasure
in
our
own
respect
and
admiration
but
still
more
generally
speaking
in
the
respect
and
admiration
of
others
the
desire
for
this
again
is
held
to
be
to
some
extent
legitimate
and
even
a
valuable
aid
to
morality
but
as
it
is
a
dangerously
seductive
impulse
and
frequently
acts
in
opposition
to
duty
it
is
felt
to
stand
in
special
need
of
humility
however
does
not
so
much
consist
in
controlling
this
desire
as
in
repressing
the
claim
for
its
satisfaction
which
we
are
naturally
disposed
to
make
upon
others
we
are
inclined
to
demand
from
others
tokens
of
respect
some
external
symbol
of
their
recognition
of
our
elevated
place
in
the
scale
of
human
beings
and
to
complain
if
our
demands
are
not
granted
such
claims
and
demands
humility
bids
us
repress
it
is
thought
to
be
our
duty
not
to
exact
in
many
cases
even
the
expression
of
reverence
which
others
are
strictly
bound
to
pay
and
yet
here
again
there
is
a
limit
in
the
view
of
common
sense
at
which
this
quality
of
behaviour
passes
over
into
a
fault
for
the
omission
of
marks
of
respect
is
sometimes
an
insult
which
impulses
commonly
regarded
as
legitimate
and
even
virtuous
sense
of
dignity
proper
pride
etc
prompt
us
to
repel
i
do
not
however
think
it
possible
to
claim
a
for
any
formula
for
determining
this
limit
footnotes
in
the
case
of
pain
which
can
not
be
avoided
we
consider
that
fortitude
will
suppress
outcries
and
lamentations
though
in
so
far
as
these
relieve
the
sufferer
without
annoying
others
the
duty
seems
doubtful
cf
chap
iv
of
this
book
the
above
remarks
apply
in
a
less
degree
to
the
moral
courage
by
which
men
face
the
pains
and
dangers
of
social
disapproval
in
the
performance
of
what
they
believe
to
be
duty
for
the
adequate
accomplishment
of
such
acts
depends
less
on
qualities
not
within
the
control
of
the
will
at
any
given
time
i
do
not
refer
to
customary
marks
of
respect
for
officials
the
omission
of
which
would
be
a
breach
of
established
order
since
the
special
political
reason
for
requiring
these
obviously
takes
the
question
beyond
the
sphere
of
application
of
the
virtue
of
humility
chapter
xi
review
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
we
have
now
concluded
such
detailed
examination
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
on
the
plan
laid
down
in
chap
of
this
book
it
seemed
desirable
to
undertake
we
have
not
discussed
all
the
terms
of
our
common
moral
vocabulary
but
i
believe
that
we
have
omitted
none
that
are
important
either
in
themselves
or
relatively
to
our
present
inquiry
for
of
those
that
remain
we
may
fairly
say
that
they
manifestly
will
not
furnish
independent
maxims
for
reflection
will
show
that
the
conduct
designated
by
them
is
either
prescribed
merely
as
a
means
to
the
performance
of
duties
already
discussed
or
is
really
identical
with
the
whole
or
part
of
some
of
these
viewed
in
some
special
aspect
or
perhaps
specialised
by
the
addition
of
some
peculiar
circumstance
or
condition
let
us
now
pause
and
survey
briefly
the
process
in
which
we
have
been
engaged
and
the
results
which
we
have
elicited
we
started
with
admitting
the
point
upon
the
proof
of
which
moralists
have
often
concentrated
their
efforts
the
existence
of
apparently
independent
moral
intuitions
it
seemed
undeniable
that
men
judge
some
acts
to
be
right
and
wrong
in
themselves
without
consideration
of
their
tendency
to
produce
happiness
to
the
agent
or
to
others
and
indeed
without
taking
their
consequences
into
account
at
all
except
in
so
far
as
these
are
included
in
the
common
notion
of
the
act
we
saw
however
that
in
so
far
as
these
judgments
are
passed
in
particular
cases
they
seem
to
involve
at
least
for
the
more
reflective
part
of
mankind
a
reference
of
the
case
to
some
general
rule
of
duty
and
that
in
the
frequent
cases
of
doubt
or
conflict
of
judgments
as
to
the
rightness
of
any
action
appeal
is
commonly
made
to
such
rules
or
maxims
as
the
ultimately
valid
principles
of
moral
cognition
in
order
therefore
to
throw
the
morality
of
common
sense
into
a
scientific
form
it
seemed
necessary
to
obtain
as
exact
a
statement
as
possible
of
these
generally
recognised
principles
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
dispense
myself
from
this
task
by
any
summary
general
argument
based
on
the
unscientific
character
of
common
morality
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
moral
opinions
of
ordinary
men
are
in
many
points
loose
shifting
and
mutually
contradictory
but
it
does
not
follow
that
we
may
not
obtain
from
this
fluid
mass
of
opinion
a
deposit
of
clear
and
precise
principles
commanding
universal
acceptance
the
question
whether
we
can
do
this
or
not
seemed
to
me
one
which
should
not
be
decided
without
a
fair
trial
and
it
is
partly
in
order
to
prepare
materials
for
this
trial
that
the
survey
in
the
preceding
eight
chapters
has
been
conducted
i
have
endeavoured
to
ascertain
impartially
by
mere
reflection
on
our
common
moral
discourse
what
are
the
general
principles
or
maxims
according
to
which
different
kinds
of
conduct
are
judged
to
be
right
and
reasonable
in
different
departments
of
life
i
wish
it
to
be
particularly
observed
that
i
have
in
no
case
introduced
my
own
views
in
so
far
as
i
am
conscious
of
their
being
at
all
peculiar
to
myself
my
sole
object
has
been
to
make
explicit
the
implied
premises
of
our
common
moral
reasoning
i
now
wish
to
subject
the
results
of
this
survey
to
a
final
examination
in
order
to
decide
whether
these
general
formulæ
possess
the
characteristics
by
which
truths
are
distinguished
from
mere
opinions
there
seem
to
be
four
conditions
the
complete
fulfilment
of
which
would
establish
a
significant
proposition
apparently
in
the
highest
degree
of
certainty
attainable
and
which
must
be
approximately
realised
by
the
premises
of
our
reasoning
in
any
inquiry
if
that
reasoning
is
to
lead
us
cogently
to
trustworthy
conclusions
i
the
terms
of
the
proposition
must
be
clear
and
precise
the
rival
originators
of
modern
methodology
descartes
and
bacon
vie
with
each
other
in
the
stress
that
they
lay
on
this
point
and
the
latter
s
warning
against
the
notiones
male
terminatæ
of
ordinary
thought
is
peculiarly
needed
in
ethical
discussion
in
fact
my
chief
business
in
the
preceding
survey
has
been
to
free
the
common
terms
of
ethics
as
far
as
possible
from
objection
on
this
score
ii
the
of
the
proposition
must
be
ascertained
by
careful
reflection
it
is
needful
to
insist
on
this
because
most
persons
are
liable
to
confound
intuitions
on
the
one
hand
with
mere
impressions
or
impulses
which
to
careful
observation
do
not
present
themselves
as
claiming
to
be
dictates
of
reason
and
on
the
other
hand
with
mere
opinions
to
which
the
familiarity
that
comes
from
frequent
hearing
and
repetition
often
gives
a
false
appearance
of
which
attentive
reflection
disperses
in
such
cases
the
cartesian
method
of
testing
the
ultimate
premises
of
our
reasonings
by
asking
ourselves
if
we
clearly
and
distinctly
apprehend
them
to
be
true
may
be
of
real
use
though
it
does
not
as
descartes
supposed
afford
a
complete
protection
against
error
a
rigorous
demand
for
in
our
premises
is
a
valuable
protection
against
the
misleading
influence
of
our
own
irrational
impulses
on
our
judgments
while
at
the
same
time
it
not
only
distinguishes
as
inadequate
the
mere
external
support
of
authority
and
tradition
but
also
excludes
the
more
subtle
and
latent
effect
of
these
in
fashioning
our
minds
to
a
facile
and
unquestioning
admission
of
common
but
unwarranted
assumptions
and
we
may
observe
that
the
application
of
this
test
is
especially
needed
in
ethics
for
on
the
one
hand
it
can
not
be
denied
that
any
strong
sentiment
however
purely
subjective
is
apt
to
transform
itself
into
the
semblance
of
an
intuition
and
it
requires
careful
contemplation
to
detect
the
illusion
whatever
we
desire
we
are
apt
to
pronounce
desirable
and
we
are
strongly
tempted
to
approve
of
whatever
conduct
gives
us
keen
pleasure
and
on
the
other
hand
among
the
rules
of
conduct
to
which
we
customarily
conform
there
are
many
which
reflection
shows
to
be
really
derived
from
some
external
authority
so
that
even
if
their
obligation
be
unquestionable
they
can
not
be
intuitively
ascertained
this
is
of
course
the
case
with
the
positive
law
of
the
community
to
which
we
belong
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
ought
at
least
generally
speaking
to
obey
this
but
what
it
is
we
can
not
of
course
ascertain
by
any
process
of
abstract
reflection
but
only
by
consulting
reports
and
statutes
here
however
the
sources
of
knowledge
are
so
definite
and
conspicuous
that
we
are
in
no
danger
of
confounding
the
knowledge
gained
from
studying
them
with
the
results
of
abstract
contemplation
the
case
is
somewhat
different
with
the
traditional
and
customary
rules
of
behaviour
which
exist
in
every
society
supplementing
the
regulative
operation
of
law
proper
here
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
distinguish
the
rules
which
a
moral
man
is
called
upon
to
define
for
himself
by
the
application
of
intuitively
known
principles
from
those
as
to
which
some
authority
external
to
the
individual
is
recognised
as
the
final
arbiter
we
may
illustrate
this
by
referring
to
two
systems
of
rules
which
we
have
before
compared
with
morality
the
law
of
honour
and
the
law
of
fashion
or
etiquette
i
noticed
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
common
terms
honourable
and
dishonourable
which
are
no
doubt
sometimes
used
like
ethical
terms
as
implying
an
absolute
standard
still
when
we
speak
of
the
code
of
honour
we
seem
to
mean
rules
of
which
the
exact
nature
is
to
be
finally
determined
by
an
appeal
to
the
general
opinion
of
persons
we
admit
that
a
man
is
in
a
sense
dishonoured
when
this
opinion
condemns
him
even
though
we
may
think
his
conduct
unobjectionable
or
even
intrinsically
admirable
similarly
when
we
consider
from
the
point
of
view
of
reason
the
rules
of
fashion
or
etiquette
some
may
seem
useful
and
commendable
some
indifferent
and
arbitrary
some
perhaps
absurd
and
burdensome
but
nevertheless
we
recognise
that
the
final
authority
on
matters
of
etiquette
is
the
custom
of
polite
society
which
feels
itself
under
no
obligation
of
reducing
its
rules
to
rational
principles
yet
it
must
be
observed
that
each
individual
in
any
society
commonly
finds
in
himself
a
knowledge
not
obviously
incomplete
of
the
rules
of
honour
and
etiquette
and
an
impulse
to
conform
to
them
without
requiring
any
further
reason
for
doing
so
each
often
seems
to
see
at
a
glance
what
is
honourable
and
polite
just
as
clearly
as
he
sees
what
is
right
and
it
requires
some
consideration
to
discover
that
in
the
former
cases
custom
and
opinion
are
generally
the
final
authority
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
and
even
in
the
case
of
rules
regarded
as
distinctly
moral
we
can
generally
find
an
element
that
seems
to
us
as
clearly
conventional
as
the
codes
just
mentioned
when
we
contemplate
the
morality
of
other
men
even
in
our
own
age
and
country
hence
we
may
reasonably
suspect
a
similar
element
in
our
own
moral
code
and
must
admit
the
great
importance
of
testing
rigorously
any
rule
which
we
find
that
we
have
a
habitual
impulse
to
obey
to
see
whether
it
really
expresses
or
can
be
referred
to
a
clear
intuition
of
rightness
iii
the
propositions
accepted
as
must
be
mutually
consistent
here
again
it
is
obvious
that
any
collision
between
two
intuitions
is
a
proof
that
there
is
error
in
one
or
the
other
or
in
both
still
we
frequently
find
ethical
writers
treating
this
point
very
lightly
they
appear
to
regard
a
conflict
of
ultimate
rules
as
a
difficulty
that
may
be
ignored
or
put
aside
for
future
solution
without
any
slur
being
thrown
on
the
scientific
character
of
the
conflicting
formulæ
whereas
such
a
collision
is
absolute
proof
that
at
least
one
of
the
formulæ
needs
qualification
and
suggests
a
doubt
whether
the
correctly
qualified
proposition
will
present
itself
with
the
same
as
the
simpler
but
inadequate
one
and
whether
we
have
not
mistaken
for
an
ultimate
and
independent
axiom
one
that
is
really
derivative
and
subordinate
iv
since
it
is
implied
in
the
very
notion
of
truth
that
it
is
essentially
the
same
for
all
minds
the
denial
by
another
of
a
proposition
that
i
have
affirmed
has
a
tendency
to
impair
my
confidence
in
its
validity
and
in
fact
universal
or
general
consent
has
often
been
held
to
constitute
by
itself
a
sufficient
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
most
important
beliefs
and
is
practically
the
only
evidence
upon
which
the
greater
part
of
mankind
can
rely
a
proposition
accepted
as
true
upon
this
ground
alone
has
of
course
neither
nor
demonstrative
evidence
for
the
mind
that
so
accepts
it
still
the
secure
acceptance
that
we
commonly
give
to
the
generalisations
of
the
empirical
sciences
rests
even
in
the
case
of
experts
largely
on
the
belief
that
other
experts
have
seen
for
themselves
the
evidence
for
these
generalisations
and
do
not
materially
disagree
as
to
its
adequacy
and
it
will
be
easily
seen
that
the
absence
of
such
disagreement
must
remain
an
indispensable
negative
condition
of
the
certainty
of
our
beliefs
for
if
i
find
any
of
my
judgments
intuitive
or
inferential
in
direct
conflict
with
a
judgment
of
some
other
mind
there
must
be
error
somewhere
and
if
i
have
no
more
reason
to
suspect
error
in
the
other
mind
than
in
my
own
reflective
comparison
between
the
two
judgments
necessarily
reduces
me
temporarily
to
a
state
of
neutrality
and
though
the
total
result
in
my
mind
is
not
exactly
suspense
of
judgment
but
an
alternation
and
conflict
between
positive
affirmation
by
one
act
of
thought
and
the
neutrality
that
is
the
result
of
another
it
is
obviously
something
very
different
from
scientific
certitude
now
if
the
account
given
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
in
the
preceding
chapters
be
in
the
main
correct
it
seems
clear
that
generally
speaking
its
maxims
do
not
fulfil
the
conditions
just
laid
down
so
long
as
they
are
left
in
the
state
of
somewhat
vague
generalities
as
we
meet
them
in
ordinary
discourse
we
are
disposed
to
yield
them
unquestioning
assent
and
it
may
be
fairly
claimed
that
the
assent
is
approximately
universal
in
the
sense
that
any
expression
of
dissent
is
eccentric
and
paradoxical
but
as
soon
as
we
attempt
to
give
them
the
definiteness
which
science
requires
we
find
that
we
can
not
do
this
without
abandoning
the
universality
of
acceptance
we
find
in
some
cases
that
alternatives
present
themselves
between
which
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
decide
but
between
which
we
can
not
pretend
that
common
sense
does
decide
and
which
often
seem
equally
or
nearly
equally
plausible
in
other
cases
the
moral
notion
seems
to
resist
all
efforts
to
obtain
from
it
a
definite
rule
in
others
it
is
found
to
comprehend
elements
which
we
have
no
means
of
reducing
to
a
common
standard
except
by
the
application
of
the
utilitarian
or
some
similar
method
even
where
we
seem
able
to
educe
from
common
sense
a
more
or
less
clear
reply
to
the
questions
raised
in
the
process
of
definition
the
principle
that
results
is
qualified
in
so
complicated
a
way
that
its
becomes
dubious
or
vanishes
altogether
and
thus
in
each
case
what
at
first
seemed
like
an
intuition
turns
out
to
be
either
the
mere
expression
of
a
vague
impulse
needing
regulation
and
limitation
which
it
can
not
itself
supply
but
which
must
be
drawn
from
some
other
source
or
a
current
opinion
the
reasonableness
of
which
has
still
to
be
shown
by
a
reference
to
some
other
principle
in
order
that
this
result
may
be
adequately
exhibited
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
travel
with
me
again
through
the
series
of
principles
elicited
from
common
sense
in
the
previous
chapters
and
to
examine
them
from
a
somewhat
different
point
of
view
before
our
primary
aim
was
to
ascertain
impartially
what
the
deliverances
of
common
sense
actually
are
we
have
now
to
ask
how
far
these
enunciations
can
claim
to
be
classed
as
intuitive
truths
the
reader
should
observe
that
throughout
this
examination
a
double
appeal
is
made
on
the
one
hand
to
his
individual
moral
consciousness
and
on
the
other
hand
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
as
expressed
generally
by
the
body
of
persons
on
whose
moral
judgment
he
is
prepared
to
rely
i
ask
him
whether
he
can
state
a
clear
precise
first
principle
according
to
which
he
is
prepared
to
judge
conduct
under
each
head
and
if
so
whether
this
principle
is
really
that
commonly
applied
in
practice
by
those
whom
he
takes
to
represent
common
sense
if
we
begin
by
considering
the
duty
of
acting
wisely
discussed
in
chap
we
may
seem
perhaps
to
have
before
us
an
axiom
of
undoubted
for
acting
wisely
appeared
to
mean
taking
the
right
means
to
the
best
ends
taking
the
means
which
reason
indicates
to
the
ends
which
reason
prescribes
and
it
is
evident
that
it
must
be
right
to
act
reasonably
equally
undeniable
is
the
immediate
inference
from
or
negative
aspect
of
this
principle
that
it
is
wrong
to
act
in
opposition
to
rational
judgment
this
taken
in
connexion
with
the
empirical
fact
of
impulses
in
our
minds
conflicting
with
reason
gives
as
another
principle
the
maxim
of
temperance
or
in
its
widest
interpretation
that
reason
should
never
give
way
to
appetite
or
and
these
principles
have
sometimes
been
enounced
with
no
little
solemnity
as
answering
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
and
supplying
the
basis
or
summary
of
a
doctrine
of
practice
but
this
statement
of
principles
turns
out
to
be
one
of
those
stages
so
provokingly
frequent
in
the
course
of
ethical
reflection
which
as
far
as
practical
guidance
is
concerned
are
really
brief
circuits
leading
us
back
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
or
rather
to
prevent
misapprehension
it
should
be
observed
that
the
maxims
just
given
may
be
understood
in
two
senses
in
one
sense
they
are
certainly
but
they
are
also
insignificant
in
another
sense
they
include
more
or
less
distinctly
a
direction
to
an
important
practical
duty
but
as
so
understood
they
lose
their
for
if
the
rules
of
wisdom
and
mean
that
we
ought
always
to
do
what
we
see
to
be
reasonable
and
that
we
are
not
to
yield
to
any
impulse
urging
us
in
an
opposite
direction
they
simply
affirm
that
it
is
our
duty
generally
and
under
special
temptations
to
do
what
we
judge
to
be
our
duty
and
convey
no
information
as
to
the
method
and
principles
by
which
duty
is
to
be
determined
but
if
these
rules
are
further
understood
as
they
sometimes
are
understood
to
prescribe
the
cultivation
of
a
habit
of
acting
rationally
that
is
of
referring
each
act
to
definitely
conceived
principles
and
ends
instead
of
allowing
it
to
be
determined
by
instinctive
impulses
then
i
can
not
see
that
the
affirmation
of
this
as
an
universal
and
absolute
rule
of
duty
is
true
for
when
reason
is
considered
not
in
the
present
as
actually
commanding
but
as
an
end
of
which
a
fuller
realisation
has
to
be
sought
in
the
future
the
point
of
view
from
which
its
sovereignty
has
to
be
judged
is
entirely
changed
the
question
is
no
longer
whether
the
dictates
of
reason
ought
always
to
be
obeyed
but
whether
the
dictation
of
reason
is
always
a
good
whether
any
degree
of
predominance
of
reason
over
mere
impulse
must
necessarily
tend
to
the
perfection
of
the
conscious
self
of
which
both
are
elements
and
it
is
surely
not
that
this
predominance
can
not
be
carried
too
far
and
that
reason
is
not
rather
in
the
knowledge
that
rational
ends
are
sometimes
better
attained
by
those
who
do
not
directly
aim
at
them
as
rational
certainly
common
sense
is
inclined
to
hold
that
in
many
matters
instinct
is
a
better
spring
of
action
than
reason
thus
it
is
commonly
said
that
a
healthy
appetite
is
a
better
guide
to
diet
than
a
doctor
s
prescription
and
again
that
marriage
is
better
undertaken
as
a
consequence
of
falling
in
love
than
in
execution
of
a
tranquil
and
deliberate
design
and
we
before
observed
chap
iv
that
there
is
a
certain
excellence
in
services
springing
from
spontaneous
affection
which
does
not
attach
to
similar
acts
done
from
pure
sense
of
duty
and
in
the
same
way
experience
seems
to
show
that
many
acts
requiring
promptitude
and
vigour
are
likely
to
be
more
energetic
and
effective
and
that
many
acts
requiring
tact
and
delicacy
are
likely
to
be
more
graceful
and
pleasant
to
others
if
they
are
done
not
in
conscious
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
reason
but
from
other
motives
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
decide
how
far
this
view
is
true
it
suffices
to
say
that
we
do
not
know
intuitively
that
it
is
not
true
to
some
extent
we
do
not
know
that
there
may
not
be
to
use
plato
s
analogy
in
the
individual
soul
no
less
than
in
the
state
the
residuum
then
of
clear
intuition
which
we
have
so
far
obtained
is
the
insignificant
proposition
that
it
is
our
duty
to
do
what
we
judge
to
be
our
duty
let
us
pass
now
to
what
i
have
called
the
duties
of
the
affections
the
rules
that
prescribe
either
love
itself
in
some
degree
or
the
services
that
naturally
spring
from
it
in
those
relations
where
it
is
expected
and
desired
here
in
the
first
place
the
question
how
far
we
are
bound
to
render
these
services
when
we
do
not
feel
the
affection
is
answered
differently
in
many
cases
by
different
persons
and
no
determination
of
the
limit
seems
and
similarly
if
we
ask
whether
affection
itself
is
a
duty
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
at
least
only
partially
within
the
control
of
the
will
and
in
so
far
as
it
can
be
produced
by
voluntary
effort
there
is
thought
to
be
something
unsatisfactory
and
unattractive
in
the
result
and
on
the
other
hand
in
certain
relations
it
seems
to
be
commonly
regarded
as
a
duty
on
those
points
the
doctrine
of
common
sense
is
rather
a
rough
compromise
between
conflicting
lines
of
thought
than
capable
of
being
deduced
from
a
clear
and
universally
accepted
principle
and
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
the
special
relations
where
common
sense
admits
no
doubt
as
to
the
broad
moral
obligation
of
at
least
rendering
such
services
as
affection
naturally
prompts
still
the
recognised
rules
of
external
duty
in
these
relations
are
in
the
first
place
wanting
in
definiteness
and
precision
and
secondly
they
do
not
when
rigorously
examined
appear
to
be
or
to
be
referable
to
independent
intuitions
so
far
as
the
of
the
duties
is
concerned
let
us
take
for
example
the
duty
of
parents
to
children
we
have
no
doubt
about
this
duty
as
a
part
of
the
present
order
of
society
by
which
the
due
growth
and
training
of
the
rising
generation
is
distributed
among
the
adults
but
when
we
reflect
on
this
arrangement
itself
we
can
not
see
that
it
is
the
best
possible
it
may
be
plausibly
maintained
that
children
would
be
better
trained
physically
and
mentally
if
they
were
brought
up
under
the
supervision
of
physicians
and
philosophers
in
large
institutions
maintained
out
of
the
general
taxes
we
can
not
decide
which
of
these
alternatives
is
preferable
we
have
to
refer
to
psychological
and
sociological
generalisations
obtained
by
empirical
study
of
human
nature
in
actual
societies
if
however
we
consider
the
duty
of
parents
by
itself
out
of
connexion
with
this
social
order
it
is
certainly
not
that
we
owe
more
to
our
own
children
than
to
others
whose
happiness
equally
depends
on
our
exertions
to
get
the
question
clear
let
us
suppose
that
i
am
thrown
with
my
family
upon
a
desert
island
where
i
find
an
abandoned
orphan
is
it
evident
that
i
am
less
bound
to
provide
this
child
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
with
the
means
of
subsistence
than
i
am
to
provide
for
my
own
children
according
to
some
my
special
duty
to
the
latter
would
arise
from
the
fact
that
i
have
brought
them
into
being
but
if
so
it
would
seem
that
on
this
principle
i
have
a
right
to
diminish
their
happiness
provided
i
do
not
turn
it
into
a
negative
quantity
since
as
without
me
they
would
not
have
existed
at
all
they
can
as
my
children
have
no
claim
upon
me
for
more
than
an
existence
on
the
whole
above
zero
in
respect
of
happiness
we
might
even
deduce
a
parental
right
so
far
as
this
special
claim
is
concerned
to
extinguish
children
painlessly
at
any
point
of
their
existence
if
only
their
life
up
to
that
point
has
been
on
the
whole
worth
having
for
how
can
persons
who
would
have
had
no
life
at
all
but
for
me
fairly
complain
that
they
are
not
allowed
more
than
a
certain
quantity
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
these
doctrines
are
even
implicitly
held
by
common
sense
but
merely
to
show
that
here
as
elsewhere
the
pursuit
of
an
irrefragable
intuition
may
lead
us
unaware
into
a
nest
of
paradoxes
it
seems
then
that
we
can
not
after
all
say
that
the
special
duty
of
parents
to
children
considered
by
itself
possesses
clear
and
it
was
easy
to
show
cf
chap
iv
that
as
recognised
by
common
sense
its
limits
are
indeterminate
the
rule
prescribing
the
duty
of
children
to
parents
need
not
detain
us
for
to
common
sense
it
certainly
seems
doubtful
whether
this
is
not
merely
a
particular
case
of
gratitude
and
we
certainly
have
no
clear
intuition
of
what
is
due
to
parents
who
do
not
deserve
gratitude
again
the
moral
relation
of
husband
and
wife
seems
to
depend
chiefly
upon
contract
and
definite
understanding
it
is
no
doubt
usually
thought
that
morality
as
well
as
law
prescribes
certain
conditions
for
all
connubial
contracts
and
in
our
own
age
and
country
it
is
held
that
they
should
be
monogamic
and
permanent
but
it
seems
clear
that
neither
of
these
opinions
would
be
maintained
to
be
a
primary
intuition
whether
these
or
any
other
legal
regulations
of
the
union
of
the
sexes
can
be
deduced
from
some
intuitive
principle
of
purity
we
will
presently
consider
but
as
for
such
conjugal
duties
as
are
not
prescribed
by
law
probably
no
one
at
the
present
day
would
maintain
that
there
is
any
such
general
agreement
as
to
what
these
are
as
would
support
the
theory
that
they
may
be
known
if
then
in
these
domestic
relations
where
the
duties
of
affection
are
commonly
recognised
as
so
imperative
and
important
we
can
find
no
really
independent
and
principles
for
determining
them
i
need
not
perhaps
spend
time
in
showing
that
the
same
is
the
case
in
respect
of
the
less
intimate
ties
of
kindred
neighbourhood
etc
that
bind
us
to
other
human
beings
indeed
this
was
made
sufficiently
manifest
in
our
previous
discussion
of
those
other
duties
no
doubt
there
are
certain
obligations
towards
human
beings
generally
which
are
speaking
broadly
unquestionable
as
for
example
the
negative
duty
of
abstaining
from
causing
pain
to
others
against
their
will
except
by
way
of
deserved
punishment
whether
this
is
to
be
placed
under
the
head
of
justice
or
benevolence
and
of
making
reparation
for
any
pain
which
we
may
have
caused
still
when
we
consider
the
extent
of
these
duties
and
try
to
define
their
limits
when
we
ask
how
far
we
may
legitimately
cause
pain
to
other
men
or
other
sentient
beings
in
order
to
obtain
happiness
for
ourselves
or
third
persons
or
even
to
confer
a
greater
good
on
the
sufferer
himself
if
the
pain
be
inflicted
against
his
will
we
do
not
seem
able
to
obtain
any
clear
and
generally
accepted
principle
for
deciding
this
point
unless
the
utilitarian
formula
be
admitted
as
such
again
as
regards
reparation
there
is
as
we
have
seen
a
fundamental
doubt
how
far
this
is
due
for
harm
that
has
been
involuntarily
caused
similarly
all
admit
that
we
have
a
general
duty
of
rendering
services
to
our
and
especially
to
those
who
are
in
special
need
and
that
we
are
bound
to
make
sacrifices
for
them
when
the
benefit
that
we
thereby
confer
very
decidedly
outweighs
the
loss
to
ourselves
but
when
we
ask
how
far
we
are
bound
to
give
up
our
own
happiness
in
order
to
promote
that
of
our
fellows
while
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
common
sense
distinctly
accepts
the
utilitarian
principle
it
yet
does
not
definitely
affirm
any
other
and
even
the
common
principle
of
gratitude
though
its
stringency
is
immediately
and
universally
felt
seems
yet
essentially
indeterminate
owing
to
the
unsolved
question
whether
the
requital
of
a
benefit
ought
to
be
proportionate
to
what
it
cost
the
benefactor
or
to
what
it
is
worth
to
the
recipient
when
we
pass
to
consider
that
element
of
justice
which
presented
itself
as
gratitude
universalised
the
same
difficulty
recurs
in
a
more
complicated
form
for
here
too
we
have
to
ask
whether
the
requital
of
good
desert
ought
to
be
proportioned
to
the
benefit
rendered
or
to
the
effort
made
to
render
it
and
if
we
scrutinise
closely
the
common
moral
notion
of
retributive
justice
it
appears
strictly
taken
to
imply
the
metaphysical
doctrine
of
free
will
since
according
to
this
conception
the
reasonableness
of
rewarding
merit
is
considered
solely
in
relation
to
the
past
without
regard
to
the
future
bad
consequences
to
be
expected
from
leaving
merit
without
encouragement
and
if
every
excellence
in
any
one
s
actions
or
productions
seems
referable
ultimately
to
causes
other
than
himself
the
individual
s
claim
to
requital
from
this
point
of
view
appears
to
vanish
on
the
other
hand
it
is
obviously
paradoxical
in
estimating
desert
to
omit
the
moral
excellences
due
to
hereditary
transmission
and
education
or
even
intellectual
excellences
since
good
intention
without
foresight
is
commonly
held
to
constitute
a
very
imperfect
merit
even
if
we
cut
through
this
speculative
difficulty
by
leaving
the
ultimate
reward
of
real
desert
to
divine
justice
we
still
seem
unable
to
find
any
clear
principles
for
framing
a
scale
of
merit
and
much
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
scale
of
demerit
which
criminal
justice
seems
to
require
and
even
if
these
difficulties
were
overcome
we
should
still
be
only
at
the
commencement
of
the
perplexities
in
which
the
practical
determination
of
justice
on
principles
is
involved
for
the
examination
of
the
contents
of
this
notion
which
we
conducted
in
chap
furnished
us
not
with
a
single
definite
principle
but
with
a
whole
swarm
of
principles
which
are
unfortunately
liable
to
come
into
conflict
with
each
other
and
of
which
even
those
that
when
singly
contemplated
have
the
air
of
being
truths
do
not
certainly
carry
with
them
any
intuitively
ascertainable
definition
of
their
mutual
boundaries
and
relations
thus
for
example
in
constructing
an
ideally
perfect
distribution
of
the
means
of
happiness
it
seems
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
notion
as
i
called
it
of
fitness
which
though
often
confounded
with
desert
seems
essentially
distinct
from
it
for
the
social
distribuend
includes
not
merely
the
means
of
obtaining
pleasurable
passive
feelings
but
also
functions
and
instruments
which
are
important
sources
of
happiness
but
which
it
is
obviously
reasonable
to
give
to
those
who
can
perform
and
use
them
and
even
as
regards
the
material
means
of
comfort
and
luxury
wealth
in
short
we
do
not
find
that
the
same
amount
produces
the
same
result
of
happiness
in
every
case
and
it
seems
reasonable
that
the
means
of
refined
and
varied
pleasure
should
be
allotted
to
those
who
have
the
corresponding
capacities
for
enjoyment
and
yet
these
may
not
be
the
most
deserving
so
that
this
principle
may
clearly
conflict
with
that
of
requiting
desert
and
either
principle
as
we
saw
is
liable
to
come
into
collision
with
the
doctrine
that
the
proper
ultimate
end
of
law
is
to
secure
the
greatest
possible
freedom
of
action
to
all
members
of
the
community
and
that
all
that
any
individual
strictly
speaking
owes
to
any
other
is
except
so
far
as
he
has
further
bound
himself
by
free
contract
but
further
when
we
come
to
examine
this
principle
in
its
turn
we
find
that
in
order
to
be
capable
at
all
of
affording
a
practical
basis
for
social
construction
it
needs
limitations
and
qualifications
which
make
it
look
less
like
an
independent
principle
than
a
middle
axiom
of
utilitarianism
and
that
it
can
not
without
a
palpable
strain
be
made
to
cover
the
most
important
rights
which
positive
law
secures
for
example
the
justification
of
permanent
appropriation
is
surely
rather
that
it
supplies
the
only
adequate
motive
for
labour
than
that
it
strictly
speaking
realises
freedom
nor
can
the
questions
that
arise
in
determining
the
limits
of
the
right
of
property
such
as
whether
it
includes
the
right
of
bequest
be
settled
by
any
deductions
from
this
supposed
fundamental
principle
nor
again
can
even
the
enforcement
of
contracts
be
fairly
said
to
be
a
realisation
of
freedom
for
a
man
seems
strictly
speaking
freer
when
no
one
of
his
volitions
is
allowed
to
cause
an
external
control
of
any
other
and
if
we
disregard
this
as
a
paradoxical
subtlety
we
are
met
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
perplexity
that
if
abstract
freedom
is
consistent
with
any
engagement
of
future
services
it
must
on
the
same
grounds
be
consistent
with
such
as
are
perpetual
and
unqualified
and
so
even
with
actual
slavery
and
this
question
becomes
especially
important
when
we
consider
that
the
duty
of
obeying
positive
laws
has
by
many
been
reconciled
with
the
abstract
right
of
freedom
by
supposing
a
tacit
compact
or
understanding
between
each
individual
and
the
rest
of
his
community
this
compact
however
seems
on
examination
too
clearly
fictitious
to
be
put
forward
as
a
basis
of
moral
duty
as
is
further
evident
from
the
indefinitely
various
qualifications
and
reservations
with
which
the
understanding
has
by
different
thinkers
been
supposed
to
be
hence
many
who
maintain
the
birthright
of
freedom
consider
that
the
only
abstractedly
justifiable
social
order
is
one
in
which
no
laws
are
imposed
without
the
consent
of
those
who
are
to
obey
them
but
we
found
it
impossible
really
to
construct
society
upon
this
basis
and
such
representative
governments
as
have
actually
been
established
only
appear
to
realise
this
idea
by
means
of
sweeping
limitations
and
transparent
fictions
it
was
manifest
too
that
the
maximum
of
what
may
be
called
constitutional
freedom
the
most
perfect
conformity
between
the
action
of
a
government
and
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
its
subjects
need
by
no
means
result
in
the
realisation
of
the
maximum
of
civil
freedom
in
the
society
so
governed
but
even
if
we
could
delineate
to
our
satisfaction
an
ideal
social
order
including
an
ideal
form
of
government
we
have
still
to
reconcile
the
duty
of
realising
this
with
the
conformity
due
to
the
actual
order
of
society
for
we
have
a
strong
conviction
that
positive
laws
ought
generally
speaking
to
be
obeyed
and
again
our
notion
of
justice
seemed
to
include
a
general
duty
of
satisfying
the
expectations
generated
by
custom
and
precedent
yet
if
the
actual
order
of
society
deviates
very
much
from
what
we
think
ought
to
exist
the
duty
of
conforming
to
it
seems
to
become
obscure
and
doubtful
and
apart
from
this
we
can
not
say
that
common
sense
regards
it
as
an
axiom
that
laws
ought
to
be
obeyed
indeed
all
are
agreed
that
they
ought
to
be
disobeyed
when
they
command
what
is
wrong
though
we
do
not
seem
able
to
elicit
any
clear
general
view
as
to
what
remains
wrong
after
it
has
been
commanded
by
the
sovereign
and
again
the
positive
laws
that
ought
to
be
obeyed
as
such
must
be
the
commands
issued
by
a
morally
rightful
authority
and
though
these
will
ordinarily
coincide
with
the
commands
legally
enforced
we
can
not
say
that
this
is
always
the
case
for
the
courts
may
be
temporarily
subservient
to
a
usurper
or
again
the
sovereign
hitherto
habitually
obeyed
may
be
one
against
whom
it
has
become
right
to
rebel
since
it
is
generally
admitted
that
this
is
sometimes
right
we
require
then
principles
for
determining
when
usurpation
becomes
legitimate
and
when
rebellion
is
justifiable
and
we
do
not
seem
able
to
elicit
these
from
common
sense
except
so
far
as
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
on
this
whole
subject
common
sense
inclines
more
to
the
utilitarian
method
than
it
does
in
matters
of
private
morality
still
less
can
we
state
the
general
duty
of
satisfying
natural
expectations
such
expectations
as
an
average
man
would
form
under
given
circumstances
in
the
form
of
a
clear
and
precise
moral
axiom
no
doubt
a
just
man
will
generally
satisfy
customary
claims
but
it
can
hardly
be
maintained
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
custom
renders
it
clearly
obligatory
that
any
one
should
conform
to
it
who
has
not
already
promised
to
do
so
especially
since
bad
customs
can
only
be
abolished
by
individuals
venturing
to
disregard
them
we
have
still
to
examine
whether
as
a
branch
of
justice
or
under
a
separate
head
the
duty
of
fulfilling
express
promises
and
distinct
understandings
the
peculiar
confidence
which
moralists
have
generally
felt
in
this
principle
is
strikingly
illustrated
by
those
endeavours
to
extend
its
scope
which
we
have
just
had
occasion
to
notice
and
it
certainly
seems
to
surpass
in
simplicity
certainty
and
definiteness
the
moral
rules
that
we
have
hitherto
discussed
here
then
if
anywhere
we
seem
likely
to
find
one
of
those
ethical
axioms
of
which
we
are
in
search
now
we
saw
that
the
notion
of
a
promise
requires
several
qualifications
not
commonly
noticed
to
make
it
precise
but
this
alone
is
no
reason
why
it
may
not
be
fitly
used
in
framing
a
maxim
which
when
enunciated
and
understood
will
properly
claim
universal
acceptance
as
for
similarly
the
uninstructed
majority
of
mankind
could
not
define
a
circle
as
a
figure
bounded
by
a
line
of
which
every
point
is
equidistant
from
the
centre
but
nevertheless
when
the
definition
is
explained
to
them
they
will
accept
it
as
expressing
the
perfect
type
of
that
notion
of
roundness
which
they
have
long
had
in
their
minds
and
the
same
potential
universality
of
acceptance
may
i
think
be
fairly
claimed
for
the
propositions
that
the
promise
which
the
common
sense
of
mankind
recognises
as
binding
must
be
understood
by
promiser
and
promisee
in
the
same
sense
at
the
time
of
promising
and
that
it
is
relative
to
the
promisee
and
capable
of
being
annulled
by
him
and
that
it
can
not
override
determinate
prior
obligations
but
the
case
is
different
with
the
other
qualifications
which
we
had
to
discuss
when
once
the
question
of
introducing
these
has
been
raised
we
see
that
common
sense
is
clearly
divided
as
to
the
answer
if
we
ask
how
far
our
promise
is
binding
if
it
was
made
in
consequence
of
false
statements
on
which
however
it
was
not
understood
to
be
conditional
or
if
important
circumstances
were
concealed
or
we
were
in
any
way
led
to
believe
that
the
consequences
of
keeping
the
promise
would
be
different
from
what
they
turn
out
to
be
or
if
the
promise
was
given
under
compulsion
or
if
circumstances
have
materially
altered
since
it
was
given
and
we
find
that
the
results
of
fulfilling
it
will
be
different
from
what
we
foresaw
when
we
promised
or
even
if
it
be
only
our
knowledge
of
consequences
which
has
altered
and
we
now
see
that
fulfilment
will
entail
on
us
a
sacrifice
out
of
proportion
to
the
benefit
received
by
the
promisee
or
perhaps
see
that
it
will
even
be
injurious
to
him
though
he
may
not
think
so
different
conscientious
persons
would
answer
these
and
other
questions
both
generally
and
in
particular
cases
in
different
ways
and
though
we
could
perhaps
obtain
a
decided
majority
for
some
of
these
qualifications
and
against
others
there
would
not
in
any
case
be
a
clear
either
way
and
moreover
the
mere
discussion
of
these
points
seems
to
make
it
plain
that
the
confidence
with
which
the
unsophisticated
conscience
asserts
unreservedly
that
promises
ought
to
be
kept
is
due
to
inadvertence
and
that
when
the
qualifications
to
which
we
referred
are
fairly
considered
this
confidence
inevitably
changes
into
hesitation
and
perplexity
it
should
be
added
that
some
of
these
qualifications
themselves
suggest
a
reference
to
the
more
comprehensive
principle
of
utilitarianism
as
one
to
which
this
particular
rule
is
naturally
subordinate
again
reflection
upon
the
place
of
this
duty
in
a
classified
system
of
moral
obligations
tends
to
confirm
our
distrust
of
the
ordinary
enunciations
of
common
sense
in
respect
of
it
for
as
was
seen
fidelity
to
promises
is
very
commonly
ranked
with
veracity
as
though
the
mere
fact
of
my
having
said
that
i
would
do
a
thing
were
the
ground
of
my
duty
to
do
it
but
on
reflection
we
perceive
that
the
obligation
must
be
regarded
as
contingent
on
the
reliance
that
another
has
placed
on
my
assertion
that
in
fact
the
breach
of
duty
is
constituted
by
the
disappointment
of
expectations
voluntarily
raised
and
when
we
see
this
we
become
less
disposed
to
maintain
the
absoluteness
of
the
duty
it
seems
now
to
depend
upon
the
amount
of
harm
done
by
disappointing
expectations
and
we
shrink
from
saying
that
the
promise
ought
to
be
kept
if
the
keeping
it
would
involve
an
amount
of
harm
that
seems
decidedly
to
outweigh
this
the
case
of
veracity
we
may
dismiss
somewhat
more
briefly
as
here
it
was
still
more
easy
to
show
that
the
common
enunciation
of
the
unqualified
duty
of
is
made
without
full
consideration
and
can
not
approve
itself
to
the
reflective
mind
as
an
absolute
first
principle
for
in
the
first
place
we
found
no
clear
agreement
as
to
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
obligation
or
as
to
its
exact
scope
whether
it
is
our
actual
affirmation
as
understood
by
the
recipient
which
we
are
bound
to
make
correspondent
to
fact
as
far
as
we
can
or
whatever
inferences
we
foresee
that
he
is
likely
to
draw
from
this
or
both
to
realise
perfect
candour
and
sincerity
we
must
aim
at
both
and
we
no
doubt
admire
the
exhibition
of
these
virtues
but
few
will
maintain
that
they
ought
to
be
exhibited
under
all
circumstances
and
secondly
it
seems
to
be
admitted
by
common
sense
though
vaguely
and
reluctantly
that
the
principle
however
defined
is
not
of
universal
application
at
any
rate
it
is
not
thought
to
be
clearly
wrong
that
untruths
should
be
told
to
children
or
madmen
or
invalids
or
by
advocates
or
to
enemies
or
robbers
or
even
to
persons
who
ask
questions
which
they
have
no
right
to
ask
if
a
mere
refusal
to
answer
would
practically
reveal
an
important
secret
and
when
we
consider
the
limitations
generally
admitted
it
seems
still
more
plain
than
in
the
last
case
that
they
are
very
commonly
determined
by
utilitarian
reasonings
implicit
or
explicit
if
then
the
prescriptions
of
justice
good
faith
and
veracity
as
laid
down
by
common
sense
appear
so
little
capable
of
being
converted
into
first
principles
of
scientific
ethics
it
seems
scarcely
necessary
to
inquire
whether
such
axioms
can
be
extracted
from
the
minor
maxims
of
social
behaviour
such
as
the
maxim
of
liberality
or
the
rules
restraining
the
malevolent
affections
or
again
from
such
virtues
as
courage
and
humility
which
we
found
it
difficult
to
class
as
either
social
or
indeed
it
was
made
plain
in
chap
viii
that
as
regards
the
proper
regulation
of
resentment
common
sense
can
only
be
saved
from
inconsistency
or
hopeless
vagueness
by
adopting
the
interest
of
society
as
the
ultimate
standard
and
in
the
same
way
we
can
not
definitely
distinguish
courage
from
foolhardiness
except
by
a
reference
to
the
probable
tendency
of
the
daring
act
to
promote
the
wellbeing
of
the
agent
or
of
others
or
to
some
definite
rule
of
duty
prescribed
under
some
other
notion
it
is
true
that
among
what
are
commonly
called
duties
to
self
we
find
the
duty
of
prescribed
with
apparent
absoluteness
at
least
so
far
as
the
sacrifice
of
one
s
life
is
not
imperatively
required
for
the
preservation
of
the
lives
of
others
or
for
the
attainment
of
some
result
conceived
to
be
very
important
to
society
i
think
however
that
when
confronted
with
the
question
of
preserving
a
life
which
we
can
foresee
will
be
both
miserable
and
burdensome
to
others
the
life
of
a
man
stricken
with
a
fatal
disease
which
precludes
the
possibility
of
work
of
any
kind
during
the
weeks
or
months
of
agony
that
remain
to
him
though
common
sense
would
still
deny
the
legitimacy
of
suicide
even
under
these
conditions
it
would
also
admit
the
necessity
of
finding
reasons
for
the
denial
this
admission
would
imply
that
the
universal
wrongness
of
suicide
is
at
any
rate
not
and
the
reasons
that
would
be
found
so
far
as
they
did
not
ultimately
depend
upon
premises
drawn
from
revelational
theology
would
i
think
turn
out
to
be
utilitarian
in
a
broad
sense
of
the
term
it
would
be
urged
that
if
any
exceptions
to
the
rule
prohibiting
suicide
were
allowed
dangerous
encouragement
would
be
given
to
the
suicidal
impulse
in
other
cases
in
which
suicide
would
really
be
a
weak
and
cowardly
dereliction
of
social
duty
it
would
also
probably
be
urged
that
the
toleration
of
suicide
would
facilitate
secret
murders
in
short
the
independent
axiom
of
which
we
are
in
search
seems
to
disappear
on
close
examination
in
this
case
no
less
than
in
others
so
again
reflection
seems
to
show
that
the
duties
of
temperance
and
other
cognate
virtues
are
only
clear
and
definite
in
so
far
as
they
are
conceived
as
subordinate
either
to
prudence
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
or
to
benevolence
or
some
definite
rule
of
social
duty
or
at
least
to
some
end
such
as
furtherance
of
moral
progress
of
which
the
conception
involves
the
notion
of
duty
supposed
to
be
already
determinate
certainly
the
authority
of
common
sense
can
not
be
fairly
claimed
for
any
restriction
even
of
the
bodily
appetites
for
food
and
drink
that
is
not
thus
subordinated
in
the
case
however
of
the
sexual
appetite
a
special
regulation
seems
to
be
prescribed
on
some
independent
principle
under
the
notion
of
purity
or
chastity
in
chap
ix
of
this
book
where
we
examined
this
notion
it
appeared
that
common
sense
is
not
only
not
explicit
but
actually
averse
to
explicitness
on
this
subject
as
my
aim
in
the
preceding
chapters
was
to
give
above
all
things
a
faithful
exposition
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
i
allowed
my
inquiry
to
be
checked
by
this
as
it
seemed
clearly
recognisable
sentiment
but
when
it
becomes
our
primary
object
to
test
the
intuitive
evidence
of
the
moral
principles
commonly
accepted
it
seems
necessary
to
override
this
aversion
for
we
can
hardly
ascertain
whether
rational
conviction
is
attainable
as
to
the
acts
allowed
and
forbidden
under
this
notion
and
its
opposite
without
subjecting
it
to
the
same
close
scrutiny
that
we
have
endeavoured
to
give
to
the
other
leading
notions
of
ethics
here
the
briefest
account
of
such
a
scrutiny
will
be
sufficient
i
am
aware
that
in
giving
even
this
i
can
not
but
cause
a
certain
offence
to
minds
trained
in
good
moral
habits
but
i
trust
i
may
claim
the
same
indulgence
as
is
commonly
granted
to
the
physiologist
who
also
has
to
direct
the
student
s
attention
to
objects
which
a
healthy
mind
is
naturally
disinclined
to
contemplate
what
then
is
the
conduct
which
purity
forbids
for
the
principle
is
more
easily
discussed
in
its
negative
aspect
as
the
normal
and
obvious
end
of
sexual
intercourse
is
the
propagation
of
the
species
some
have
thought
that
all
indulgence
of
appetite
except
as
a
means
to
this
end
should
be
prohibited
but
this
doctrine
would
lead
to
a
restriction
of
conjugal
intercourse
far
too
severe
for
common
sense
shall
we
say
then
that
purity
forbids
such
indulgence
except
under
the
conditions
of
conjugal
union
defined
by
law
but
this
answer
again
further
reflection
shows
to
be
unsatisfactory
for
first
we
should
not
on
consideration
call
a
conjugal
union
impure
because
the
parties
had
wilfully
omitted
to
fulfil
legal
conditions
and
had
made
a
contract
which
the
law
declined
to
enforce
we
might
condemn
their
conduct
but
we
should
not
apply
to
it
this
notion
and
secondly
we
feel
that
positive
law
may
be
unfavourable
to
purity
and
that
in
fact
purity
like
justice
is
something
which
the
law
ought
to
maintain
but
does
not
always
we
have
to
ask
then
what
kind
of
sexual
relations
we
are
to
call
essentially
impure
whether
countenanced
or
not
by
law
and
custom
there
appear
to
be
no
distinct
principles
having
any
claim
to
upon
which
the
question
can
be
answered
so
as
to
command
general
assent
it
would
be
difficult
even
to
state
such
a
principle
for
determining
the
degree
of
consanguinity
between
husband
and
wife
which
constitutes
a
union
incestuous
although
the
aversion
with
which
such
unions
are
commonly
regarded
is
a
peculiarly
intense
moral
sentiment
and
the
difficulty
becomes
indefinitely
greater
when
we
consider
the
of
prohibited
degrees
of
affinity
again
probably
few
would
stigmatise
a
legal
polygynous
connexion
as
impure
however
they
might
disapprove
of
the
law
and
of
the
state
of
society
in
which
such
a
law
was
established
but
if
legal
polygyny
is
not
impure
is
polyandry
when
legal
and
customary
as
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
among
the
lower
races
of
man
to
be
so
characterised
and
if
not
on
what
rational
principle
can
the
notion
be
applied
to
institutions
and
conduct
again
where
divorce
by
mutual
consent
with
subsequent
marriage
is
legalised
we
do
not
call
this
an
offence
against
purity
and
yet
if
the
principle
of
free
change
be
once
admitted
it
seems
paradoxical
to
distinguish
purity
from
impurity
merely
by
less
rapidity
of
transition
and
to
condemn
as
impure
even
free
love
in
so
far
as
it
is
earnestly
advocated
as
a
means
to
a
completer
harmony
of
sentiment
between
men
and
women
and
not
to
mere
sensual
license
shall
we
then
fall
back
upon
the
presence
of
mutual
affection
as
distinguished
from
mere
appetite
as
constituting
the
essence
of
pure
sexual
relations
but
this
again
while
too
lax
from
one
point
of
view
seems
from
another
too
severe
for
common
sense
as
we
do
not
condemn
marriages
without
affection
as
impure
although
we
disapprove
of
them
as
productive
of
unhappiness
such
marriages
indeed
are
sometimes
stigmatised
as
legalised
prostitution
but
the
phrase
is
felt
to
be
extravagant
and
paradoxical
and
it
is
even
doubtful
whether
we
do
disapprove
of
them
under
all
circumstances
as
in
the
case
of
royal
alliances
again
how
shall
we
judge
of
such
institutions
as
those
of
plato
s
commonwealth
establishing
community
of
women
and
children
but
at
the
same
time
regulating
sexual
indulgence
with
the
strictest
reference
to
social
ends
our
habitual
standards
seem
inapplicable
to
such
novel
circumstances
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
reflection
on
the
current
sexual
morality
discovers
to
us
two
distinct
grounds
for
it
first
and
chiefly
the
maintenance
of
a
certain
social
order
believed
to
be
most
conducive
to
the
prosperous
continuance
of
the
human
race
and
secondly
the
protection
of
habits
of
feeling
in
individuals
believed
to
be
generally
most
important
to
their
perfection
or
their
happiness
we
commonly
conceive
that
both
these
ends
are
to
be
attained
by
the
same
regulations
and
in
an
ideal
state
of
society
this
would
perhaps
be
the
case
but
in
actual
life
there
is
frequently
a
partial
separation
and
incompatibility
between
them
but
further
if
the
repression
of
sexual
license
is
prescribed
merely
as
a
means
to
these
ends
it
does
not
seem
that
we
can
affirm
as
that
it
is
always
a
necessary
means
in
either
case
on
the
contrary
it
seems
clear
that
such
an
affirmation
would
be
unreliable
apart
from
empirical
confirmation
we
can
not
reasonably
be
sure
without
induction
from
sociological
observations
that
a
certain
amount
of
sexual
license
will
be
incompatible
with
the
maintenance
of
population
in
sufficient
numbers
and
good
condition
and
if
we
consider
the
matter
in
its
relation
to
the
individual
s
perfection
it
is
certainly
clear
that
he
misses
the
highest
and
best
development
of
his
emotional
nature
if
his
sexual
relations
are
of
a
merely
sensual
kind
but
we
can
hardly
know
that
this
lower
kind
of
relation
interferes
with
the
development
of
the
higher
nor
indeed
does
experience
seem
to
show
that
this
is
universally
the
case
and
this
latter
line
of
argument
has
a
further
difficulty
for
the
common
opinion
that
we
have
to
justify
does
not
merely
condemn
the
lower
kind
of
development
in
comparison
with
the
higher
but
in
comparison
with
none
at
all
since
we
do
not
positively
blame
a
man
for
remaining
celibate
though
we
perhaps
despise
him
somewhat
unless
the
celibacy
is
adopted
as
a
means
to
a
noble
end
it
is
difficult
to
show
why
we
should
condemn
in
its
bearing
on
the
individual
s
emotional
perfection
solely
the
imperfect
development
afforded
by
merely
sensual
relations
much
more
might
be
said
to
exhibit
the
perplexities
in
which
the
attempt
to
define
the
rule
of
purity
or
chastity
involves
us
but
i
do
not
desire
to
extend
the
discussion
beyond
what
is
necessary
for
the
completion
of
my
argument
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
announced
in
of
this
chapter
has
now
been
sufficiently
justified
we
have
examined
the
moral
notions
that
present
themselves
with
a
claim
to
furnish
independent
and
rules
of
morality
and
we
have
in
each
case
found
that
from
such
regulation
of
conduct
as
the
common
sense
of
mankind
really
supports
no
proposition
can
be
elicited
which
when
fairly
contemplated
even
appears
to
have
the
characteristic
of
a
scientific
axiom
it
is
therefore
scarcely
needful
to
proceed
to
a
systematic
examination
of
the
manner
in
which
common
sense
provides
for
the
of
these
principles
in
fact
this
question
seems
to
have
been
already
discussed
as
far
as
is
profitable
for
the
attempt
to
define
each
principle
singly
has
inevitably
led
us
to
consider
their
mutual
relations
and
it
was
in
the
cases
where
two
moral
principles
came
into
collision
that
we
most
clearly
saw
the
vagueness
and
inconsistency
with
which
the
boundaries
of
each
are
determined
by
common
sense
for
example
the
distinction
between
perfectly
stringent
moral
obligations
and
such
laxer
duties
as
may
be
modified
by
a
man
s
own
act
is
often
taken
and
it
is
one
which
as
we
saw
is
certainly
required
in
formulating
the
view
of
the
effect
of
a
promise
in
creating
new
obligations
but
it
is
one
which
we
can
not
apply
with
any
practical
precision
because
of
the
high
degree
of
indeterminateness
which
we
find
in
the
common
notions
of
duties
to
which
the
highest
degree
of
stringency
is
yet
commonly
attributed
it
only
remains
to
guard
my
argument
from
being
understood
in
a
more
sweeping
sense
than
it
has
been
intended
or
is
properly
able
to
bear
nothing
that
i
have
said
even
tends
to
show
that
we
have
not
distinct
moral
impulses
claiming
authority
over
all
others
and
prescribing
or
forbidding
kinds
of
conduct
as
to
which
there
is
a
rough
general
agreement
at
least
among
educated
persons
of
the
same
age
and
country
it
is
only
maintained
that
the
objects
of
these
impulses
do
not
admit
of
being
scientifically
determined
by
any
reflective
analysis
of
common
sense
the
notions
of
benevolence
justice
good
faith
veracity
purity
are
not
necessarily
emptied
of
significance
for
us
because
we
have
found
it
impossible
to
define
them
with
precision
the
main
part
of
the
conduct
prescribed
under
each
notion
is
sufficiently
clear
and
the
general
rule
prescribing
it
does
not
necessarily
lose
its
force
because
there
is
in
each
case
a
margin
of
conduct
involved
in
obscurity
and
perplexity
or
because
the
rule
does
not
on
examination
appear
to
be
absolute
and
independent
in
short
the
morality
of
common
sense
may
still
be
perfectly
adequate
to
give
practical
guidance
to
common
people
in
common
circumstances
but
the
attempt
to
elevate
it
into
a
system
of
intuitional
ethics
brings
its
inevitable
imperfections
into
prominence
without
helping
us
to
remove
them
footnotes
hence
the
practical
importance
of
the
formal
test
of
rightness
on
which
kant
insists
cf
chap
i
of
this
book
the
final
arbiter
that
is
on
the
question
what
the
rule
is
of
course
the
moral
obligation
to
conform
to
any
rule
laid
down
by
an
external
authority
must
rest
on
some
principle
which
the
individual
s
reason
has
to
apply
cf
book
chap
iii
cf
book
chap
iii
it
has
been
fairly
urged
that
i
leave
the
determinations
of
common
sense
very
loose
and
indefinite
and
if
i
were
endeavouring
to
bring
out
a
more
positive
result
from
this
examination
i
ought
certainly
to
have
discussed
further
how
we
are
to
ascertain
the
experts
on
whose
consensus
we
are
to
rely
in
this
or
any
other
subject
but
my
scientific
conclusions
are
to
so
great
an
extent
negative
that
i
thought
it
hardly
necessary
to
enter
upon
this
discussion
i
have
been
careful
not
to
the
doubtfulness
and
inconsistency
of
common
sense
should
it
turn
out
to
be
doubtful
and
inconsistent
than
i
have
represented
it
my
argument
will
only
be
strengthened
in
chap
ix
temperance
was
regarded
as
subordinate
to
or
a
special
application
of
prudence
or
moralised
because
this
seemed
to
be
on
the
whole
the
view
of
common
sense
which
in
the
preceding
chapters
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
follow
as
closely
as
possible
both
in
stating
the
principles
educed
and
in
the
order
of
their
exposition
the
admission
that
these
maxims
are
must
be
taken
subject
to
the
distinction
before
established
between
subjective
and
objective
rightness
it
is
a
necessary
condition
of
my
acting
rightly
that
i
should
not
do
what
i
judge
to
be
wrong
but
if
my
judgment
is
mistaken
my
action
in
accordance
with
it
will
not
be
objectively
right
it
may
be
noticed
that
a
view
very
similar
to
this
has
often
been
maintained
in
considering
what
god
is
in
justice
bound
to
do
for
human
beings
in
consequence
of
the
relation
in
which
he
stands
to
them
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
notice
the
remarkable
divergence
of
suggestions
for
the
better
regulation
of
marriage
to
which
reflective
minds
seem
to
be
led
when
they
are
once
set
loose
from
the
trammels
of
tradition
and
custom
as
exhibited
in
the
speculations
of
philosophers
in
all
ages
especially
of
those
as
plato
to
whom
we
can
not
attribute
any
sensual
or
licentious
bias
for
example
many
seem
to
hold
that
wealth
is
roughly
speaking
rightly
distributed
when
cultivated
persons
have
abundance
and
the
uncultivated
a
bare
subsistence
since
the
former
are
far
more
capable
of
deriving
happiness
from
wealth
than
the
latter
i
refer
later
to
the
difficulty
before
noticed
in
respect
of
such
prior
obligations
as
are
not
strictly
determinate
i
have
omitted
as
less
important
the
special
questions
connected
with
promises
to
the
dead
or
to
the
absent
or
where
a
form
of
words
is
prescribed
it
was
this
conception
that
seemed
to
give
the
true
standard
of
humility
considered
as
a
purely
internal
duty
it
should
be
observed
that
i
am
not
asking
for
an
exact
quantitative
decision
but
whether
we
can
really
think
that
the
decision
depends
upon
considerations
of
this
kind
it
should
be
observed
that
the
more
positive
treatment
of
morality
in
its
relation
to
utilitarianism
to
which
we
shall
proceed
in
chap
iii
of
the
following
book
is
intended
as
an
indispensable
supplement
of
the
negative
criticism
which
has
just
been
completed
chapter
xii
motives
or
springs
of
action
considered
as
subjects
of
moral
judgment
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
third
book
i
was
careful
to
point
out
that
motives
as
well
as
intentions
form
part
of
the
of
our
common
moral
judgments
and
indeed
in
our
notion
of
conscientiousness
the
habit
of
reflecting
on
motives
and
judging
them
to
be
good
or
bad
is
a
prominent
element
it
is
necessary
therefore
in
order
to
complete
our
examination
of
the
intuitional
method
to
consider
this
comparison
of
motives
and
ascertain
how
far
it
can
be
made
systematic
and
pursued
to
conclusions
of
scientific
value
and
this
seems
a
convenient
place
for
treating
of
this
part
of
the
subject
since
it
has
been
maintained
by
an
important
school
of
english
moralists
that
desires
and
affections
rather
than
acts
are
the
proper
subjects
of
the
ethical
judgment
and
it
is
natural
to
fall
back
upon
this
view
when
systematic
reflection
on
the
morality
of
common
sense
has
shown
us
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
precise
and
satisfactory
determination
of
rightness
and
wrongness
in
external
conduct
to
avoid
confusion
it
should
be
observed
that
the
term
motive
is
commonly
used
in
two
ways
it
is
sometimes
applied
to
those
among
the
foreseen
consequences
of
any
act
which
the
agent
desired
in
willing
and
sometimes
to
the
desire
or
conscious
impulse
itself
the
two
meanings
are
in
a
manner
correspondent
as
where
impulses
are
different
there
must
always
be
some
sort
of
difference
in
their
respective
objects
but
for
our
present
purpose
it
is
more
convenient
to
take
the
latter
meaning
as
it
is
our
own
impulsive
nature
that
we
have
practically
to
deal
with
in
the
way
of
controlling
resisting
indulging
the
different
impulses
and
therefore
it
is
the
ethical
value
of
these
that
we
are
primarily
concerned
to
estimate
and
we
often
find
that
two
impulses
which
would
be
placed
very
far
apart
in
any
psychological
list
are
directed
towards
an
end
materially
identical
though
regarded
from
a
different
point
of
view
in
each
case
as
both
appetite
and
rational
may
impel
a
man
to
seek
a
particular
sensual
gratification
though
in
the
latter
case
it
is
regarded
under
the
general
notion
of
pleasure
and
as
forming
part
of
a
sum
called
happiness
in
this
chapter
then
i
shall
use
the
term
motive
to
denote
the
desires
of
particular
results
believed
to
be
attainable
as
consequences
of
our
voluntary
acts
by
which
desires
we
are
stimulated
to
will
those
acts
the
first
point
to
notice
in
considering
the
ethical
result
of
a
comprehensive
comparison
of
motives
is
that
the
issue
in
any
internal
conflict
is
not
usually
thought
to
be
between
positively
good
and
bad
but
between
better
and
less
good
more
or
less
estimable
or
elevated
motives
the
only
kind
of
motive
which
if
any
we
commonly
judge
to
be
bad
apart
from
the
circumstances
under
which
it
operates
is
malevolent
affection
that
is
the
desire
however
aroused
to
inflict
pain
or
harm
on
some
other
sentient
being
and
reflection
shows
as
we
saw
in
chap
viii
of
this
book
that
common
sense
does
not
pronounce
even
this
kind
of
impulse
absolutely
bad
since
we
commonly
recognise
the
existence
of
legitimate
resentment
and
righteous
indignation
and
though
moralists
try
to
distinguish
between
anger
directed
against
the
act
and
against
the
agent
and
between
the
impulse
to
inflict
pain
and
the
desire
of
the
antipathetic
pleasure
that
the
agent
will
reap
from
this
infliction
it
may
be
fairly
doubted
whether
it
is
within
the
capacity
of
ordinary
human
nature
to
maintain
these
distinctions
in
practice
at
any
rate
there
is
no
other
motive
except
deliberate
malevolence
which
common
sense
condemns
as
absolutely
bad
the
other
motives
that
are
commonly
spoken
of
in
dyslogistic
terms
seem
to
be
most
properly
called
in
bentham
s
language
seductive
rather
than
bad
that
is
they
prompt
to
forbidden
conduct
with
conspicuous
force
and
frequency
but
when
we
consider
them
carefully
we
find
that
there
are
certain
limits
however
narrow
within
which
their
operation
is
legitimate
the
question
then
is
how
far
the
intuitive
knowledge
that
our
common
judgments
seem
to
imply
of
the
relative
goodness
of
different
kinds
of
motives
is
found
on
reflection
to
satisfy
the
conditions
laid
down
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
have
before
argued
that
it
is
incorrect
to
regard
this
comparison
of
as
the
normal
form
of
our
common
moral
judgments
nor
do
i
see
any
ground
for
holding
it
to
be
the
original
form
i
think
that
in
the
normal
development
of
man
s
moral
consciousness
both
in
the
individual
and
in
the
race
moral
judgments
are
first
passed
on
outward
acts
and
that
motives
do
not
come
to
be
definitely
considered
till
later
just
as
external
perception
of
physical
objects
precedes
introspection
at
the
same
time
in
my
view
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
the
comparison
of
motives
is
not
the
final
and
most
perfect
form
of
the
moral
judgment
it
might
approve
itself
as
such
by
the
systematic
clearness
and
mutual
consistency
of
the
results
to
which
it
led
when
pursued
by
different
thinkers
independently
and
by
its
freedom
from
the
puzzles
and
difficulties
to
which
other
developments
of
the
intuitional
method
seem
to
be
exposed
it
appears
however
on
examination
that
on
the
one
hand
many
if
not
all
of
the
difficulties
which
have
emerged
in
the
preceding
discussion
of
the
commonly
received
principles
of
conduct
are
reproduced
in
a
different
form
when
we
try
to
arrange
motives
in
order
of
excellence
and
on
the
other
hand
such
a
construction
presents
difficulties
peculiar
to
itself
and
the
attempt
to
solve
these
exhibits
greater
and
more
fundamental
differences
among
intuitive
moralists
as
regards
rank
of
motive
than
we
found
to
exist
as
regards
rightness
of
outward
acts
in
the
first
place
it
has
to
be
decided
whether
we
are
to
include
in
our
list
of
motives
the
moral
sentiments
or
impulses
towards
particular
kinds
of
virtuous
conduct
as
such
candour
veracity
fortitude
it
seems
unwarrantable
to
exclude
them
as
such
sentiments
are
observable
as
distinct
and
independent
impulses
in
most
minds
and
we
sometimes
recognise
their
existence
in
considerable
intensity
as
when
we
speak
of
a
man
being
enthusiastically
brave
or
intensely
veracious
or
as
having
a
passion
for
at
the
same
time
their
admission
places
us
in
the
following
dilemma
either
the
objects
of
these
impulses
are
represented
by
the
very
notions
that
we
have
been
examining
in
which
case
after
we
have
decided
that
any
impulse
is
better
than
its
rival
all
the
perplexities
set
forth
in
the
previous
chapters
will
recur
before
we
can
act
on
our
decision
for
what
avails
it
to
recognise
the
superiority
of
the
impulse
to
do
justice
if
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
just
to
do
or
if
in
any
case
the
object
which
a
moral
sentiment
prompts
us
to
realise
is
conceived
more
simply
without
the
qualifications
which
a
complete
reflection
on
common
sense
forced
us
to
recognise
then
as
the
previous
investigation
shows
we
shall
certainly
not
find
agreement
as
to
the
relation
between
this
and
other
impulses
for
example
a
dispute
whether
the
impulse
to
speak
the
truth
ought
or
ought
not
to
be
followed
will
inevitably
arise
when
veracity
seems
opposed
either
to
the
general
good
or
to
the
interests
of
some
particular
person
that
is
when
it
conflicts
with
particular
or
universal
benevolence
hutcheson
expressly
places
these
latter
impulses
in
a
higher
rank
than
candour
veracity
fortitude
reserving
the
highest
moral
approbation
for
the
most
extensive
benevolence
or
calm
stable
universal
goodwill
to
but
this
view
which
coincides
practically
with
utilitarianism
would
certainly
be
disputed
by
most
intuitional
moralists
again
some
of
these
moralists
as
kant
regard
all
actions
as
bad
or
not
good
which
are
not
done
from
pure
regard
for
duty
or
choice
of
right
as
right
while
hutcheson
who
represents
the
opposite
pole
of
intuitional
ethics
equally
distinguishes
the
love
of
virtue
as
a
separate
impulse
but
treats
it
as
at
once
in
rank
and
coincident
in
its
effects
with
universal
benevolence
so
again
moralists
diverge
widely
in
estimating
the
ethical
value
of
for
butler
seems
to
regard
it
as
one
of
two
superior
and
naturally
authoritative
impulses
the
other
being
conscience
nay
in
a
passage
before
quoted
he
even
concedes
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
conscience
to
yield
to
it
if
the
two
could
possibly
conflict
other
moralists
and
butler
elsewhere
appear
to
place
among
virtuous
impulses
under
the
name
of
prudence
though
among
these
they
often
rank
it
rather
low
and
would
have
it
yield
in
case
of
conflict
to
nobler
virtues
others
again
exclude
it
from
virtue
altogether
kant
in
one
of
his
treatises
says
that
the
end
of
one
s
own
happiness
can
not
be
an
end
for
the
moral
reason
that
the
force
of
the
reasonable
will
in
which
virtue
consists
is
always
exhibited
in
resistance
to
natural
egoistic
impulses
martineau
whose
system
is
framed
on
the
basis
that
i
am
now
examining
attempts
to
avoid
some
of
the
difficulties
just
pointed
out
by
refusing
to
admit
the
existence
of
any
virtuous
impulses
except
the
preference
for
the
superior
of
the
competing
springs
of
action
in
each
case
of
a
conflict
of
motives
i
can
not
admit
he
says
either
the
of
of
candour
veracity
fortitude
or
the
virtues
themselves
as
so
many
additional
impulses
over
and
above
those
from
the
conflict
of
which
they
are
formed
i
do
not
confess
my
fault
order
to
be
unless
i
am
a
prig
i
never
think
of
candour
as
predicable
or
going
to
be
predicable
of
me
at
i
am
not
however
sure
whether
martineau
really
means
to
the
existence
of
persons
who
act
from
a
conscious
desire
to
realise
an
ideal
of
candour
or
fortitude
or
whether
he
merely
means
to
express
of
such
persons
in
the
former
sense
his
statement
seems
to
me
a
psychological
paradox
in
conflict
with
ordinary
experience
in
the
latter
sense
it
seems
an
ethical
paradox
affording
a
striking
example
of
that
diversity
of
judgments
as
to
the
rank
of
motives
to
which
i
am
now
drawing
attention
but
even
if
we
put
out
of
sight
the
moral
sentiments
and
it
is
still
scarcely
possible
to
frame
a
scale
of
motives
arranged
in
order
of
merit
for
which
we
could
claim
anything
like
a
clear
consent
even
of
cultivated
and
thoughtful
persons
on
one
or
two
points
indeed
we
seem
to
be
generally
agreed
that
the
bodily
appetites
are
inferior
to
the
benevolent
affections
and
the
intellectual
desires
and
perhaps
that
impulses
tending
primarily
to
the
of
the
individual
are
lower
in
rank
than
those
which
we
class
as
or
disinterested
but
beyond
a
few
vague
statements
of
this
kind
it
is
very
difficult
to
proceed
for
example
when
we
compare
personal
affections
with
the
love
of
knowledge
or
of
beauty
or
the
passion
for
the
ideal
in
any
form
much
doubt
and
divergence
of
opinion
become
manifest
indeed
we
should
hardly
agree
on
the
relative
rank
of
the
benevolent
affections
taken
by
themselves
for
some
would
prefer
the
more
intense
though
narrower
while
others
would
place
the
calmer
and
wider
feelings
in
the
highest
rank
or
again
since
love
as
we
saw
is
a
complex
emotion
and
commonly
includes
besides
the
desire
of
the
good
or
happiness
of
the
beloved
a
desire
for
union
or
intimacy
of
some
kind
some
would
consider
an
affection
more
elevated
in
proportion
as
the
former
element
predominated
while
others
would
regard
the
latter
as
at
least
equally
essential
to
the
highest
kind
of
affection
again
we
may
notice
the
love
of
fame
as
an
important
and
widely
operative
motive
which
would
be
ranked
very
differently
by
different
persons
for
some
would
place
the
former
spur
that
the
clear
spirit
doth
raise
among
the
most
elevated
impulses
after
the
moral
sentiments
while
others
think
it
degrading
to
depend
for
one
s
happiness
on
the
breath
of
popular
favour
further
the
more
we
contemplate
the
actual
promptings
that
precede
any
volition
the
more
we
seem
to
find
complexity
of
motive
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
at
least
in
the
case
of
educated
persons
and
from
this
composition
of
impulses
there
results
a
fundamental
perplexity
as
to
the
principles
on
which
our
decision
is
to
be
made
even
supposing
that
we
have
a
clear
view
of
the
relative
worth
of
the
elementary
impulses
for
the
compound
will
generally
contain
nobler
and
baser
elements
and
we
can
hardly
get
rid
of
the
latter
since
as
i
have
before
said
though
we
may
frequently
suppress
and
expel
a
motive
by
firmly
resisting
it
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
exclude
it
if
we
do
the
act
to
which
it
prompts
suppose
then
that
we
are
impelled
in
one
direction
by
a
combination
of
high
and
low
motives
and
in
another
by
an
impulse
that
ranks
between
the
two
in
the
scale
how
shall
we
decide
which
course
to
follow
such
a
case
is
by
no
means
uncommon
an
injured
man
may
be
moved
by
an
impulse
of
pity
to
spare
his
injurer
while
a
regard
for
justice
and
a
desire
of
revenge
combined
impel
him
to
inflict
punishment
or
again
a
jew
of
liberal
views
might
be
restrained
from
eating
pork
by
a
desire
not
to
shock
the
feelings
of
his
friends
and
might
be
moved
to
eat
it
by
the
desire
to
vindicate
true
religious
liberty
combined
with
a
liking
for
pork
how
are
we
to
deal
with
such
a
case
as
this
for
it
will
hardly
be
suggested
that
we
should
estimate
the
relative
proportions
of
the
different
motives
and
decide
accordingly
qualitative
analysis
of
our
motives
is
to
some
extent
possible
to
us
but
the
quantitative
analysis
that
this
would
require
is
not
in
our
power
but
even
apart
from
this
difficulty
arising
from
complexity
of
motives
i
think
it
impossible
to
assign
a
definite
and
constant
ethical
value
to
each
different
kind
of
motive
without
reference
to
the
particular
circumstances
under
which
it
has
arisen
the
extent
of
indulgence
that
it
demands
and
the
consequences
to
which
this
indulgence
would
lead
in
any
particular
case
i
may
conveniently
illustrate
this
by
reference
to
the
table
drawn
up
by
martineau
of
springs
of
action
arranged
in
order
of
merit
lowest
secondary
passions
censoriousness
vindictiveness
suspiciousness
secondary
organic
propensions
love
of
ease
and
sensual
pleasure
primary
organic
propensions
appetites
primary
animal
propension
spontaneous
activity
unselective
love

from

secondary

and
admiration
primary
affections
parental
and
social
with
approximately

and

highest
this
scale
seems
to
me
open
to
much
criticism
both
from
a
psychological
and
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
but
granting
that
it
corresponds
broadly
to
the
judgments
that
men
commonly
pass
as
to
the
different
elevation
of
different
motives
it
seems
to
me
in
the
highest
degree
paradoxical
to
lay
down
that
each
class
of
motives
is
always
to
be
preferred
to
the
class
below
it
without
regard
to
circumstances
and
consequences
so
far
as
it
is
true
that
the
conscience
says
to
every
one
do
not
eat
till
you
are
hungry
and
stop
when
you
are
hungry
no
more
it
is
not
i
venture
to
think
because
a
regulative
right
is
clearly
vested
in
primary
instinctive
needs
relatively
to
their
secondaries
but
because
experience
has
shown
that
to
seek
the
gratification
of
the
palate
apart
from
the
satisfaction
of
hunger
is
generally
dangerous
to
physical
and
it
is
in
view
of
this
danger
that
the
conscience
operates
if
we
condemn
a
ship
captain
who
caught
in
a
fog
off
a
lee
shore
neglects
through
indolence
and
love
of
ease
to
slacken
speed
and
take
cautious
soundings
and
open
his
it
is
not
because
we
intuitively
discern
fear
to
be
a
higher
motive
than
love
of
ease
but
because
the
consequences
disregarded
are
judged
to
be
indefinitely
more
important
than
the
gratification
obtained
if
we
took
a
case
in
which
fear
was
not
similarly
sustained
by
prudence
our
judgment
would
certainly
be
different
the
view
of
common
sense
appears
rather
to
be
that
most
natural
impulses
have
their
proper
spheres
within
which
they
should
be
normally
operative
and
therefore
the
question
whether
in
any
case
a
higher
motive
should
yield
to
a
lower
one
can
not
be
answered
decisively
in
the
general
way
in
which
martineau
answers
it
the
answer
must
depend
on
the
particular
conditions
and
circumstances
of
the
conflict
we
recognise
it
as
possible
that
a
motive
which
we
commonly
rank
as
higher
may
wrongly
intrude
into
the
proper
sphere
of
one
which
we
rank
as
lower
just
as
the
lower
is
liable
to
encroach
on
the
higher
only
since
there
is
very
much
less
danger
of
the
former
intrusion
it
naturally
falls
into
the
background
in
ethical
discussions
and
exhortations
that
have
a
practical
aim
the
matter
is
complicated
by
the
further
consideration
that
as
the
character
of
a
moral
agent
becomes
better
the
motives
that
we
rank
as
higher
tend
to
be
developed
so
that
their
normal
sphere
of
operation
is
enlarged
at
the
expense
of
the
lower
hence
there
are
two
distinct
aims
in
moral
regulation
and
culture
so
far
as
they
relate
to
motives
to
keep
the
lower
motive
within
the
limits
within
which
its
operation
is
considered
to
be
legitimate
and
good
on
the
whole
so
long
as
we
can
not
substitute
for
it
the
equally
effective
operation
of
a
higher
motive
and
at
the
same
time
to
effect
this
substitution
of
higher
for
lower
gradually
as
far
as
can
be
done
without
danger
up
to
a
limit
which
we
can
not
definitely
fix
but
which
we
certainly
conceive
for
the
most
part
as
falling
short
of
complete
exclusion
of
the
lower
motive
i
may
illustrate
by
reference
to
the
passion
of
resentment
of
which
i
before
spoke
the
view
of
reflective
common
sense
is
i
think
that
the
malevolent
impulse
so
designated
as
long
as
it
is
strictly
limited
to
resentment
against
wrong
and
operates
in
aid
of
justice
has
a
legitimate
sphere
of
action
in
the
social
life
of
human
beings
as
actually
constituted
that
indeed
its
suppression
would
be
gravely
mischievous
unless
we
could
at
the
same
time
intensify
the
ordinary
man
s
regard
for
justice
or
for
social
so
that
the
total
strength
of
motives
prompting
to
the
punishment
of
crime
should
not
be
diminished
it
is
no
doubt
to
be
wished
as
butler
says
that
men
would
repress
wrong
from
these
higher
motives
rather
than
from
passionate
resentment
but
we
can
not
hope
to
effect
this
change
in
human
beings
generally
except
by
a
slow
and
gradual
process
of
elevation
of
character
therefore
supposing
a
conflict
between
compassion
which
is
highest
but
one
in
martineau
s
scale
and
resentment
which
he
places
about
the
middle
it
is
by
no
means
to
be
laid
down
as
a
general
rule
that
compassion
ought
to
prevail
we
ought
rather
with
butler
to
regard
resentment
as
a
salutary
balance
to
the
weakness
of
pity
which
would
be
liable
to
prevent
the
execution
of
justice
if
resentment
were
excluded
or
we
might
similarly
take
the
impulse
which
comes
lowest
among
those
not
condemned
altogether
in
martineau
s
scale
the
love
of
ease
and
sensual
no
doubt
this
impulse
or
group
of
impulses
is
continually
leading
men
to
shirk
or
scamp
their
strict
duty
or
to
fall
in
some
less
definite
way
below
their
own
ideal
of
conduct
hence
the
attitude
habitually
maintained
towards
it
by
preachers
and
practical
moralists
is
that
of
repression
still
common
sense
surely
recognises
that
there
are
cases
in
which
even
this
impulse
ought
to
prevail
over
impulses
ranked
above
it
in
martineau
s
scale
we
often
find
men
prompted
say
by
love
of
gain
to
shorten
unduly
their
hours
of
recreation
and
in
the
case
of
a
conflict
of
motives
under
such
circumstances
we
should
judge
it
best
that
victory
should
remain
on
the
side
of
the
love
of
ease
and
pleasure
and
that
the
encroachment
of
love
of
gain
should
be
repelled
i
do
not
however
think
that
in
either
of
these
instances
the
conflict
of
motives
would
remain
such
as
i
have
just
described
i
think
that
though
the
struggle
might
begin
as
a
duel
between
resentment
and
compassion
or
between
love
of
ease
and
love
of
gain
it
would
not
be
fought
out
in
the
lists
so
drawn
since
higher
motives
would
inevitably
be
called
in
as
the
conflict
went
on
regard
for
justice
and
social
on
the
side
of
resentment
regard
for
health
and
ultimate
efficiency
for
work
on
the
side
of
love
of
ease
and
it
would
be
the
intervention
of
these
higher
motives
that
would
decide
the
struggle
so
far
as
it
was
decided
rightly
and
as
we
should
approve
this
certainly
is
what
would
happen
in
my
own
case
if
the
supposed
conflict
were
at
all
serious
and
its
decision
deliberate
and
this
constitutes
my
final
reason
for
holding
that
such
a
scale
as
martineau
has
drawn
up
of
motives
arranged
according
to
their
moral
rank
can
never
have
more
than
a
very
subordinate
ethical
importance
i
admit
that
it
may
serve
to
indicate
in
a
rough
and
general
way
the
kinds
of
desires
which
it
is
ordinarily
best
to
encourage
and
indulge
in
comparison
with
other
kinds
which
are
ordinarily
likely
to
compete
and
collide
with
them
and
we
might
thus
settle
summarily
some
of
the
comparatively
trifling
conflicts
of
motive
which
the
varying
and
complex
play
of
needs
habits
interests
and
their
accompanying
emotions
continually
stirs
in
our
daily
life
but
if
a
serious
question
of
conduct
is
raised
i
can
not
conceive
myself
deciding
it
morally
by
any
comparison
of
motives
below
the
highest
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
must
inevitably
be
carried
up
for
decision
into
the
court
of
whatever
motive
we
regard
as
supremely
regulative
so
that
the
comparison
ultimately
decisive
would
be
not
between
the
lower
motives
primarily
conflicting
but
between
the
effects
of
the
different
lines
of
conduct
to
which
these
lower
motives
respectively
prompt
considered
in
relation
to
whatever
we
regard
as
the
ultimate
end
or
ends
of
reasonable
action
and
this
i
conceive
will
be
the
course
naturally
taken
by
the
moral
reflection
not
only
of
utilitarians
but
of
all
who
follow
butler
in
regarding
our
passions
and
propensions
as
forming
naturally
a
system
or
constitution
in
which
the
ends
of
lower
impulses
are
subordinate
as
means
to
the
ends
of
certain
governing
motives
or
are
comprehended
as
parts
in
these
larger
ends

a
peculiar
view
is
taken
of
motives
of
that
kind
by
which
it
is
the
characteristic
of
moral
or
human
action
to
be
such
motives
it
is
maintained
must
be
distinguished
from
desires
in
the
sense
of
mere
solicitations
of
which
a
man
is
conscious
they
are
constituted
by
the
reaction
of
the
man
s
self
upon
these
and
its
identification
of
itself
with
one
of
in
fact
the
direction
of
the
self
to
the
realisation
of
an
object
which
i
should
call
an
act
of
will
is
the
phenomenon
to
which
green
would
restrict
the
term
desire
in
that
sense
in
which
desire
is
the
principle
and
notion
of
an
imputable
human
the
use
of
terms
here
suggested
appears
to
me
inconvenient
and
the
psychological
analysis
implied
in
it
to
a
great
extent
erroneous
i
admit
that
in
certain
simple
cases
of
choice
where
the
alternatives
suggested
are
each
prompted
by
a
single
definite
desire
there
is
no
psychological
inaccuracy
in
saying
that
in
willing
the
act
to
which
he
is
stimulated
by
any
such
desire
the
agent
identifies
himself
with
the
but
in
more
complex
cases
the
phrase
appears
to
me
incorrect
as
obliterating
important
distinctions
between
the
two
kinds
of
psychical
phenomena
which
are
usually
and
conveniently
distinguished
as
desires
and
volitions
in
the
first
place
as
i
have
before
pointed
out
chap
i
of
this
book
it
often
happens
that
certain
foreseen
consequences
of
volition
which
as
foreseen
are
undoubtedly
and
in
a
sense
by
the
agents
are
not
objects
of
desire
to
him
at
all
but
even
possibly
of
aversion
aversion
of
course
overcome
by
his
desire
of
other
consequences
of
the
same
act
in
the
second
place
it
is
specially
important
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
to
notice
that
among
the
various
desires
or
aversions
aroused
in
us
by
the
complex
foreseen
consequences
of
a
contemplated
act
there
are
often
impulses
with
which
we
do
not
identify
ourselves
but
which
we
even
try
to
suppress
as
far
as
possible
though
as
it
is
not
possible
to
suppress
them
completely
especially
if
we
do
the
act
to
which
they
prompt
we
can
not
say
that
they
do
not
operate
as
motives
cf

this
book

see

nature
of

it
ought
to
be
observed
that
the
ethical
view
briefly
expounded

appears
to
have
much
more
affinity
with
butler

of

edition
cf
chap
iv
of
this
book
of

martineau
explains
that
the
chief
composite
springs
are
inserted
in
their
approximate
place
subject
to
the
variations
of
which
their
composition
renders
them
susceptible
thus
we
might
ask
why
the
class
of
passions
is
so
strangely
restricted
why
conjugal
affection
is
omitted
whether
wonder
can
properly
be
regarded
as
a
definite
motive
whether
censoriousness
is
properly
ranked
with
vindictiveness
as
one
of
the
lowest
passions

philosophical
intuitionism
is
there
then
no
possibility
of
attaining
by
a
more
profound
and
discriminating
examination
of
our
common
moral
thought
to
real
ethical
axioms
intuitive
propositions
of
real
clearness
and
certainty
this
question
leads
us
to
the
examination
of
that
third
phase
of
the
intuitive
method
which
was
called
philosophical
intuitionism
for
we
conceive
it
as
the
aim
of
a
philosopher
as
such
to
do
somewhat
more
than
define
and
formulate
the
common
moral
opinions
of
mankind
his
function
is
to
tell
men
what
they
ought
to
think
rather
than
what
they
do
think
he
is
expected
to
transcend
common
sense
in
his
premises
and
is
allowed
a
certain
divergence
from
common
sense
in
his
conclusions
it
is
true
that
the
limits
of
this
deviation
are
firmly
though
indefinitely
fixed
the
truth
of
a
philosopher
s
premises
will
always
be
tested
by
the
acceptability
of
his
conclusions
if
in
any
important
point
he
be
found
in
flagrant
conflict
with
common
opinion
his
method
is
likely
to
be
declared
invalid
still
though
he
is
expected
to
establish
and
concatenate
at
least
the
main
part
of
the
commonly
accepted
moral
rules
he
is
not
necessarily
bound
to
take
them
as
the
basis
on
which
his
own
system
is
constructed
rather
we
should
expect
that
the
history
of
moral
philosophy
so
far
at
least
as
those
whom
we
may
call
orthodox
thinkers
are
concerned
would
be
a
history
of
attempts
to
enunciate
in
full
breadth
and
clearness
those
primary
intuitions
of
reason
by
the
scientific
application
of
which
the
common
moral
thought
of
mankind
may
be
at
once
systematised
and
corrected
and
this
is
to
some
extent
the
case
but
moral
philosophy
or
philosophy
as
applied
to
morality
has
had
other
tasks
to
occupy
it
even
more
profoundly
difficult
than
that
of
penetrating
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
duty
in
modern
times
especially
it
has
admitted
the
necessity
of
demonstrating
the
harmony
of
duty
with
interest
that
is
with
the
happiness
or
welfare
of
the
agent
on
whom
the
duty
in
each
case
is
imposed
it
has
also
undertaken
to
determine
the
relation
of
right
or
good
generally
to
the
world
of
actual
existence
a
task
which
could
hardly
be
satisfactorily
accomplished
without
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
existence
of
evil
it
has
further
been
distracted
by
questions
which
in
my
view
are
of
psychological
rather
than
ethical
importance
as
to
the
innateness
of
our
notions
of
duty
and
the
origin
of
the
faculty
that
furnishes
them
with
their
attention
concentrated
on
these
difficult
subjects
each
of
which
has
been
mixed
up
in
various
ways
with
the
discussion
of
fundamental
moral
intuitions
philosophers
have
too
easily
been
led
to
satisfy
themselves
with
ethical
formulæ
which
implicitly
accept
the
morality
of
common
sense
ignoring
its
defects
and
merely
express
a
certain
view
of
the
relation
of
this
morality
to
the
individual
mind
or
to
the
universe
of
actual
existence
perhaps
also
they
have
been
hampered
by
the
fear
not
as
we
have
seen
unfounded
of
losing
the
support
given
by
general
assent
if
they
set
before
themselves
and
their
readers
too
rigid
a
standard
of
scientific
precision
still
in
spite
of
all
these
drawbacks
we
find
that
philosophers
have
provided
us
with
a
considerable
number
of
comprehensive
moral
propositions
put
forward
as
certain
and
and
such
as
at
first
sight
may
seem
well
adapted
to
serve
as
the
first
principles
of
scientific
morality
but
here
a
word
of
caution
seems
required
which
has
been
somewhat
anticipated
in
earlier
chapters
but
on
which
it
is
particularly
needful
to
lay
stress
at
this
point
of
our
discussion
against
a
certain
class
of
which
are
very
apt
to
offer
themselves
to
the
mind
that
is
earnestly
seeking
for
a
philosophical
synthesis
of
practical
rules
and
to
delude
the
unwary
with
a
tempting
aspect
of
clear
these
are
principles
which
appear
certain
and
because
they
are
substantially
tautological
because
when
examined
they
are
found
to
affirm
no
more
than
that
it
is
right
to
do
that
which
is
in
a
certain
department
of
life
under
certain
circumstances
and
conditions
right
to
be
done
one
important
lesson
which
the
history
of
moral
philosophy
teaches
is
that
in
this
region
even
powerful
intellects
are
liable
to
acquiesce
in
tautologies
of
this
kind
sometimes
expanded
into
circular
reasonings
sometimes
hidden
in
the
recesses
of
an
obscure
notion
often
lying
so
near
the
surface
that
when
once
they
have
been
exposed
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
they
could
ever
have
presented
themselves
as
important
let
us
turn
for
illustration
s
sake
to
the
cardinal
virtues
if
we
are
told
that
the
dictates
of
wisdom
and
temperance
may
be
summed
up
in
clear
and
certain
principles
and
that
these
are
respectively
it
is
right
to
act
rationally
it
is
right
that
the
lower
parts
of
our
nature
should
be
governed
by
the
higher
we
do
not
at
first
feel
that
we
are
not
obtaining
valuable
information
but
when
we
find
cf
chap
xi
that
acting
rationally
is
merely
another
phrase
for
doing
what
we
see
to
be
right
and
again
that
the
higher
part
of
our
nature
to
which
the
rest
are
to
submit
is
explained
to
be
reason
so
that
acting
temperately
is
only
acting
rationally
under
the
condition
of
special
impulses
needing
to
be
resisted
the
tautology
of
our
principles
is
obvious
similarly
when
we
are
asked
to
accept
as
the
principle
of
justice
that
we
ought
to
give
every
man
his
own
the
definition
seems
plausible
until
it
appears
that
we
can
not
define
his
own
except
as
equivalent
to
that
which
it
is
right
he
should
the
definitions
quoted
may
be
found
in
modern
writers
but
it
seems
worthy
of
remark
that
throughout
the
ethical
speculation
of
greece
such
universal
affirmations
as
are
presented
to
us
concerning
virtue
or
good
conduct
seem
almost
always
to
be
propositions
which
can
only
be
defended
from
the
charge
of
tautology
if
they
are
understood
as
definitions
of
the
problem
to
be
solved
and
not
as
attempts
at
its
solution
for
example
plato
and
aristotle
appear
to
offer
as
constructive
moralists
the
scientific
knowledge
on
ethical
matters
of
which
socrates
proclaimed
the
absence
knowledge
that
is
of
the
good
and
bad
in
human
life
and
they
seem
to
be
agreed
that
such
good
as
can
be
realised
in
the
concrete
life
of
men
and
communities
is
chiefly
virtue
or
as
aristotle
more
precisely
puts
it
the
of
virtue
so
that
the
practical
part
of
ethical
science
must
consist
mainly
in
the
knowledge
of
virtue
if
however
we
ask
how
we
are
to
ascertain
the
kind
of
conduct
which
is
properly
to
be
called
virtuous
it
does
not
seem
that
plato
can
tell
us
more
of
each
virtue
in
turn
than
that
it
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
what
is
good
in
certain
circumstances
and
relations
and
such
a
harmony
of
the
different
elements
of
man
s
appetitive
nature
that
their
resultant
impulse
may
be
always
in
accordance
with
this
knowledge
but
it
is
just
this
knowledge
or
at
least
its
principles
and
method
that
we
are
expecting
him
to
give
us
and
to
explain
to
us
instead
the
different
exigencies
under
which
we
need
it
in
no
way
satisfies
our
expectation
nor
again
does
aristotle
bring
us
much
nearer
such
knowledge
by
telling
us
that
the
good
in
conduct
is
to
be
found
somewhere
between
different
kinds
of
bad
this
at
best
only
indicates
the
of
virtue
it
does
not
give
us
a
method
for
finding
it
on
the
stoic
system
as
constructed
by
zeno
and
chrysippus
it
is
perhaps
unfair
to
pronounce
decisively
from
the
accounts
given
of
it
by
adversaries
like
plutarch
and
such
expositors
as
cicero
diogenes
laertius
and
stobæus
but
as
far
as
we
can
judge
of
it
we
must
pronounce
the
exposition
of
its
general
principles
a
complicated
enchainment
of
circular
reasonings
by
which
the
inquirer
is
continually
deluded
with
an
apparent
approach
to
practical
conclusions
and
continually
led
back
to
the
point
from
which
he
set
out
the
most
characteristic
formula
of
stoicism
seems
to
have
been
that
declaring
life
according
to
nature
to
be
the
ultimate
end
of
action
the
spring
of
the
motion
that
sustained
this
life
was
in
the
vegetable
creation
a
mere
unfelt
impulse
in
animals
it
was
impulse
accompanied
with
sensation
in
man
it
was
the
direction
of
reason
which
in
him
was
naturally
supreme
over
all
merely
blind
irrational
impulses
what
then
does
reason
direct
to
live
according
to
nature
is
one
answer
and
thus
we
get
the
circular
exposition
of
ethical
doctrine
in
its
simplest
form
sometimes
however
we
are
told
that
it
is
life
according
to
virtue
which
leads
us
into
the
circle
already
noticed
in
the
philosophy
as
virtue
by
the
stoics
also
is
only
defined
as
knowledge
of
good
and
bad
in
different
circumstances
and
relations
indeed
this
latter
circle
is
given
by
the
stoics
more
neatly
and
perfectly
for
with
plato
and
aristotle
virtue
was
not
the
but
only
the
content
of
the
notion
good
in
its
application
to
human
life
but
in
the
view
of
stoicism
the
two
notions
are
absolutely
coincident
the
result
then
is
that
virtue
is
knowledge
of
what
is
good
and
ought
to
be
sought
or
chosen
and
of
what
is
bad
and
ought
to
be
shunned
or
rejected
while
at
the
same
time
there
is
nothing
good
or
properly
nothing
bad
or
truly
formidable
except
virtue
and
vice
respectively
but
if
virtue
is
thus
declared
to
be
a
science
that
has
no
object
except
itself
the
notion
is
inevitably
emptied
of
all
practical
content
in
order
therefore
to
avoid
this
result
and
to
reconcile
their
system
with
common
sense
the
stoics
explained
that
there
were
other
things
in
human
life
which
were
in
a
manner
preferable
though
not
strictly
good
including
in
this
class
the
primary
objects
of
men
s
normal
impulses
on
what
principle
then
are
we
to
select
these
objects
when
our
impulses
are
conflicting
or
ambiguous
if
we
can
get
an
answer
to
this
question
we
shall
at
length
have
come
to
something
practical
but
here
again
the
stoic
could
find
no
other
general
answer
except
either
that
we
were
to
choose
what
was
reasonable
or
that
we
were
to
act
in
accordance
with
nature
each
of
which
answers
obviously
brings
us
back
into
the
original
circle
at
a
different
point
in
butler
s
use
of
the
stoic
formula
this
circular
reasoning
seems
to
be
avoided
but
it
is
so
only
so
long
as
the
intrinsic
reasonableness
of
right
conduct
is
ignored
or
suppressed
butler
assumes
with
his
opponents
that
it
is
reasonable
to
live
according
to
nature
and
argues
that
conscience
or
the
faculty
that
imposes
moral
rules
is
naturally
supreme
in
man
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
obey
conscience
but
are
the
rules
that
conscience
lays
down
merely
known
to
us
as
the
dictates
of
arbitrary
authority
and
not
as
in
themselves
reasonable
this
would
give
a
surely
dangerous
absoluteness
of
authority
to
the
possibly
unenlightened
conscience
of
any
individual
and
butler
is
much
too
cautious
to
do
this
in
fact
in
more
than
one
passage
of
the
he
expressly
adopts
the
doctrine
of
clarke
that
the
true
rules
of
morality
are
essentially
reasonable
but
if
conscience
is
after
all
reason
applied
to
practice
then
butler
s
argument
seems
to
bend
itself
into
the
old
circle
it
is
reasonable
to
live
according
to
nature
and
it
is
natural
to
live
according
to
in
the
next
chapter
i
shall
have
to
call
attention
to
another
logical
circle
into
which
we
are
liable
to
slide
if
we
refer
to
the
good
or
perfection
whether
of
the
agent
or
of
others
in
giving
an
account
of
any
special
virtue
if
we
allow
ourselves
in
explaining
good
or
perfection
to
use
the
general
notion
of
virtue
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
an
important
element
of
either
meanwhile
i
have
already
given
perhaps
more
than
sufficient
illustration
of
one
of
the
most
important
dangers
that
beset
the
students
of
ethics
in
the
laudable
attempt
to
escape
from
the
doubtfulness
disputableness
and
apparent
arbitrariness
of
current
moral
opinions
he
is
liable
to
take
refuge
in
principles
that
are
incontrovertible
but
tautological
and
insignificant
can
we
then
between
this
scylla
and
charybdis
of
ethical
inquiry
avoiding
on
the
one
hand
doctrines
that
merely
bring
us
back
to
common
opinion
with
all
its
imperfections
and
on
the
other
hand
doctrines
that
lead
us
round
in
a
circle
find
any
way
of
obtaining
moral
principles
of
real
significance
it
would
be
disheartening
to
have
to
regard
as
altogether
illusory
the
strong
instinct
of
common
sense
that
points
to
the
existence
of
such
principles
and
the
deliberate
convictions
of
the
long
line
of
moralists
who
have
enunciated
them
at
the
same
time
the
more
we
extend
our
knowledge
of
man
and
his
environment
the
more
we
realise
the
vast
variety
of
human
natures
and
circumstances
that
have
existed
in
different
ages
and
countries
the
less
disposed
we
are
to
believe
that
there
is
any
definite
code
of
absolute
rules
applicable
to
all
human
beings
without
exception
and
we
shall
find
i
think
that
the
truth
lies
between
these
two
conclusions
there
are
certain
absolute
practical
principles
the
truth
of
which
when
they
are
explicitly
stated
is
manifest
but
they
are
of
too
abstract
a
nature
and
too
universal
in
their
scope
to
enable
us
to
ascertain
by
immediate
application
of
them
what
we
ought
to
do
in
any
particular
case
particular
duties
have
still
to
be
determined
by
some
other
method
one
such
principle
was
given
in
chap
i
of
this
book
where
i
pointed
out
that
whatever
action
any
of
us
judges
to
be
right
for
himself
he
implicitly
judges
to
be
right
for
all
similar
persons
in
similar
circumstances
or
as
we
may
otherwise
put
it
if
a
kind
of
conduct
that
is
right
or
wrong
for
me
is
not
right
or
wrong
for
some
one
else
it
must
be
on
the
ground
of
some
difference
between
the
two
cases
other
than
the
fact
that
i
and
he
are
different
a
corresponding
proposition
may
be
stated
with
equal
truth
in
respect
of
what
ought
to
be
done
not
different
individuals
these
principles
have
been
most
widely
recognised
not
in
their
most
abstract
and
universal
form
but
in
their
special
application
to
the
situation
of
two
or
more
individuals
similarly
related
to
each
other
as
so
applied
they
appear
in
what
is
popularly
known
as
the
golden
rule
do
to
others
as
you
would
have
them
do
to
this
formula
is
obviously
unprecise
in
statement
for
one
might
wish
for
another
s
in
sin
and
be
willing
to
reciprocate
it
nor
is
it
even
true
to
say
that
we
ought
to
do
to
others
only
what
we
think
it
right
for
them
to
do
to
us
for
no
one
will
deny
that
there
may
be
differences
in
the
circumstances
and
even
in
the
natures
of
two
individuals
and
which
would
make
it
wrong
for
to
treat
in
the
way
in
which
it
is
right
for
to
treat
in
short
the
principle
strictly
stated
must
take
some
such
negative
form
as
this
it
can
not
be
right
for
to
treat
in
a
manner
in
which
it
would
be
wrong
for
to
treat
merely
on
the
ground
that
they
are
two
different
individuals
and
without
there
being
any
difference
between
the
natures
or
circumstances
of
the
two
which
can
be
stated
as
a
reasonable
ground
for
difference
of
such
a
principle
manifestly
does
not
give
complete
guidance
indeed
its
effect
strictly
speaking
is
merely
to
throw
a
definite
on
the
man
who
applies
to
another
a
treatment
of
which
he
would
complain
if
applied
to
himself
but
common
sense
has
amply
recognised
the
practical
importance
of
the
maxim
and
its
truth
so
far
as
it
goes
appears
to
me
a
somewhat
different
application
of
the
same
fundamental
principle
that
individuals
in
similar
conditions
should
be
treated
similarly
finds
its
sphere
in
the
ordinary
administration
of
law
or
as
we
say
of
accordingly
in
of
chap
of
this
book
i
drew
attention
to
impartiality
in
the
application
of
general
rules
as
an
important
element
in
the
common
notion
of
justice
indeed
there
ultimately
appeared
to
be
no
other
element
which
could
be
intuitively
known
with
perfect
clearness
and
certainty
here
again
it
must
be
plain
that
this
precept
of
impartiality
is
insufficient
for
the
complete
determination
of
just
conduct
as
it
does
not
help
us
to
decide
what
kind
of
rules
should
be
thus
impartially
applied
though
all
admit
the
importance
of
excluding
from
government
and
human
conduct
generally
all
conscious
partiality
and
respect
of
the
principle
just
discussed
which
seems
to
be
more
or
less
clearly
implied
in
the
common
notion
of
fairness
or
equity
is
obtained
by
considering
the
similarity
of
the
individuals
that
make
up
a
logical
whole
or
genus
there
are
others
no
less
important
which
emerge
in
the
consideration
of
the
similar
parts
of
a
mathematical
or
quantitative
whole
such
a
whole
is
presented
in
the
common
notion
of
the
good
or
as
is
sometimes
said
good
on
the
whole
of
any
individual
human
being
the
proposition
that
one
ought
to
aim
at
one
s
own
good
is
sometimes
given
as
the
maxim
of
rational
or
prudence
but
as
so
stated
it
does
not
clearly
avoid
tautology
since
we
may
define
good
as
what
one
ought
to
aim
if
however
we
say
one
s
good
on
the
whole
the
addition
suggests
a
principle
which
when
explicitly
stated
is
at
any
rate
not
tautological
i
have
already
referred
to
this
principle
as
that
of
impartial
concern
for
all
parts
of
our
conscious
life
we
might
express
it
concisely
by
saying
that
hereafter
is
to
be
regarded
neither
less
nor
more
than
it
is
not
of
course
meant
that
the
good
of
the
present
may
not
reasonably
be
preferred
to
that
of
the
future
on
account
of
its
greater
certainty
or
again
that
a
week
ten
years
hence
may
not
be
more
important
to
us
than
a
week
now
through
an
increase
in
our
means
or
capacities
of
happiness
all
that
the
principle
affirms
is
that
the
mere
difference
of
priority
and
posteriority
in
time
is
not
a
reasonable
ground
for
having
more
regard
to
the
consciousness
of
one
moment
that
to
that
of
another
the
form
in
which
it
practically
presents
itself
to
most
men
is
that
a
smaller
present
good
is
not
to
be
preferred
to
a
greater
future
good
allowing
for
difference
of
certainty
since
prudence
is
generally
exercised
in
restraining
a
present
desire
the
object
or
satisfaction
of
which
we
commonly
regard
as
a
good
on
account
of
the
remoter
consequences
of
gratifying
it
the
commonest
view
of
the
principle
would
no
doubt
be
that
the
present
or
is
reasonably
to
be
foregone
with
the
view
of
obtaining
greater
pleasure
or
happiness
hereafter
but
the
principle
need
not
be
restricted
to
a
hedonistic
application
it
is
equally
applicable
to
any
other
interpretation
of
one
s
own
good
in
which
good
is
conceived
as
a
mathematical
whole
of
which
the
integrant
parts
are
realised
in
different
parts
or
moments
of
a
lifetime
and
therefore
it
is
perhaps
better
to
distinguish
it
here
from
the
principle
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
ultimate
good
which
does
not
seem
to
have
any
logical
connexion
with
it
so
far
we
have
only
been
considering
the
good
on
the
whole
of
a
single
individual
but
just
as
this
notion
is
constructed
by
comparison
and
integration
of
the
different
goods
that
succeed
one
another
in
the
series
of
our
conscious
states
so
we
have
formed
the
notion
of
universal
good
by
comparison
and
integration
of
the
goods
of
all
individual
human
or
sentient
existences
and
here
again
just
as
in
the
former
case
by
considering
the
relation
of
the
integrant
parts
to
the
whole
and
to
each
other
i
obtain
the
principle
that
the
good
of
any
one
individual
is
of
no
more
importance
from
the
point
of
view
if
i
may
say
so
of
the
universe
than
the
good
of
any
other
unless
that
is
there
are
special
grounds
for
believing
that
more
good
is
likely
to
be
realised
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
and
it
is
evident
to
me
that
as
a
rational
being
i
am
bound
to
aim
at
good
generally
so
far
as
it
is
attainable
by
my
efforts
not
merely
at
a
particular
part
of
it
from
these
two
rational
intuitions
we
may
deduce
as
a
necessary
inference
the
maxim
of
benevolence
in
an
abstract
form
viz
that
each
one
is
morally
bound
to
regard
the
good
of
any
other
individual
as
much
as
his
own
except
in
so
far
as
he
judges
it
to
be
less
when
impartially
viewed
or
less
certainly
knowable
or
attainable
by
him
i
before
observed
that
the
duty
of
benevolence
as
recognised
by
common
sense
seems
to
fall
somewhat
short
of
this
but
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
urged
in
explanation
of
this
that
each
man
even
with
a
view
to
universal
good
ought
chiefly
to
concern
himself
with
promoting
the
good
of
a
limited
number
of
human
beings
and
that
generally
in
proportion
to
the
closeness
of
their
connexion
with
him
i
think
that
a
plain
man
in
a
modern
civilised
society
if
his
conscience
were
fairly
brought
to
consider
the
hypothetical
question
whether
it
would
be
morally
right
for
him
to
seek
his
own
happiness
on
any
occasion
if
it
involved
a
certain
sacrifice
of
the
greater
happiness
of
some
other
human
being
without
any
counterbalancing
gain
to
any
one
else
would
answer
unhesitatingly
in
the
negative
i
have
tried
to
show
how
in
the
principles
of
justice
prudence
and
rational
benevolence
as
commonly
recognised
there
is
at
least
a
element
immediately
cognisable
by
abstract
intuition
depending
in
each
case
on
the
relation
which
individuals
and
their
particular
ends
bear
as
parts
to
their
wholes
and
to
other
parts
of
these
wholes
i
regard
the
apprehension
with
more
or
less
distinctness
of
these
abstract
truths
as
the
permanent
basis
of
the
common
conviction
that
the
fundamental
precepts
of
morality
are
essentially
reasonable
no
doubt
these
principles
are
often
placed
side
by
side
with
other
precepts
to
which
custom
and
general
consent
have
given
a
merely
illusory
air
of
but
the
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
maxims
appears
to
me
to
become
manifest
by
merely
reflecting
upon
them
i
know
by
direct
reflection
that
the
propositions
i
ought
to
speak
the
truth
i
ought
to
keep
my
promises
however
true
they
may
be
are
not
to
me
they
present
themselves
as
propositions
requiring
rational
justification
of
some
kind
on
the
other
hand
the
propositions
i
ought
not
to
prefer
a
present
lesser
good
to
a
future
greater
good
and
i
ought
not
to
prefer
my
own
lesser
good
to
the
greater
good
of
another
do
present
themselves
as
as
much
as
the
mathematical
axiom
that
if
equals
be
added
to
equals
the
wholes
are
it
is
on
account
of
the
fundamental
and
manifest
importance
in
my
view
of
the
distinction
above
drawn
between
the
moral
maxims
which
reflection
shows
not
to
possess
ultimate
validity
and
the
moral
maxims
which
are
or
involve
genuine
ethical
axioms
that
i
refrained
at
the
outset
of
this
investigation
from
entering
at
length
into
the
psychogonical
question
as
to
the
origin
of
apparent
moral
intuitions
for
no
psychogonical
theory
has
ever
been
put
forward
professing
to
discredit
the
propositions
that
i
regard
as
really
axiomatic
by
showing
that
the
causes
which
produced
them
were
such
as
had
a
tendency
to
make
them
false
while
as
regards
the
former
class
of
maxims
a
psychogonical
proof
that
they
are
untrustworthy
when
taken
as
absolutely
and
without
qualification
true
is
in
my
view
superfluous
since
direct
reflection
shows
me
they
have
no
claim
to
be
so
taken
on
the
other
hand
so
far
as
psychogonical
theory
represents
moral
rules
as
speaking
broadly
and
generally
means
to
the
ends
of
individual
and
social
good
or
it
obviously
tends
to
give
a
general
support
to
the
conclusions
to
which
the
preceding
discussion
has
brought
us
by
a
different
method
since
it
leads
us
to
regard
other
moral
rules
as
subordinate
to
the
principles
of
prudence
and
benevolence
i
should
however
rely
less
confidently
on
the
conclusions
set
forth
in
the
preceding
section
if
they
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
in
substantial
agreement
in
spite
of
superficial
differences
with
the
doctrines
of
those
moralists
who
have
been
most
in
earnest
in
seeking
among
commonly
received
moral
rules
for
genuine
intuitions
of
the
practical
reason
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
in
the
history
of
english
ethics
the
earlier
intuitional
school
show
in
this
respect
a
turn
of
thought
on
the
whole
more
philosophical
than
that
which
the
reaction
against
hume
rendered
prevalent
among
the
writers
of
this
school
there
is
no
one
who
shows
more
earnestness
in
the
effort
to
penetrate
to
really
principles
than
clarke
accordingly
i
find
that
clarke
lays
down
in
respect
of
our
behaviour
towards
our
two
fundamental
rules
of
righteousness
the
first
of
which
he
terms
equity
and
the
second
love
or
benevolence
the
rule
of
equity
he
states
thus
whatever
i
judge
reasonable
or
unreasonable
that
another
should
do
for
me
that
by
the
same
judgment
i
declare
reasonable
or
unreasonable
that
i
should
the
like
do
for
him
which
is
of
course
the
golden
rule
precisely
stated
the
obligation
to
universal
love
or
benevolence
he
exhibits
as
follows
if
there
be
a
natural
and
necessary
difference
between
good
and
evil
and
that
which
is
good
is
fit
and
reasonable
and
that
which
is
evil
is
unreasonable
to
be
done
and
that
which
is
the
greatest
good
is
always
the
most
fit
and
reasonable
to
be
chosen
then
every
rational
creature
ought
in
its
sphere
and
station
according
to
its
respective
powers
and
faculties
to
do
all
the
good
it
can
to
its
to
which
end
universal
love
and
benevolence
is
plainly
the
most
certain
direct
and
effectual
here
the
mere
statement
that
a
rational
agent
is
bound
to
aim
at
universal
good
is
open
to
the
charge
of
tautology
since
clarke
defines
good
as
that
which
is
fit
and
reasonable
to
be
but
clarke
obviously
holds
that
each
individual
rational
creature
is
capable
of
receiving
good
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
such
good
being
an
integrant
part
of
universal
good
this
indeed
is
implied
in
the
common
notion
which
he
uses
of
doing
good
to
one
s
or
as
he
otherwise
expresses
it
promoting
their
welfare
and
and
thus
his
principle
is
implicitly
what
was
stated
above
that
the
good
or
welfare
of
any
one
individual
must
as
such
be
an
object
of
rational
aim
to
any
other
reasonable
individual
no
less
than
his
own
similar
good
or
welfare
it
should
be
observed
however
that
the
proposition
that
universal
benevolence
is
the
right
means
to
the
attainment
of
universal
good
is
not
quite
since
the
end
may
not
always
be
best
attained
by
directly
aiming
at
it
thus
rational
benevolence
like
rational
may
be
may
direct
its
own
partial
suppression
in
favour
of
other
impulses
among
later
moralists
kant
is
especially
noted
for
his
rigour
in
separating
the
purely
rational
element
of
the
moral
code
and
his
ethical
view
also
appears
to
me
to
coincide
to
a
considerable
extent
if
not
completely
with
that
set
forth
in
the
preceding
section
i
have
already
noticed
that
his
fundamental
principle
of
duty
is
the
formal
rule
of
acting
on
a
maxim
that
one
can
will
to
be
law
universal
which
duly
restricted
is
an
immediate
practical
corollary
from
the
principle
that
i
first
noticed
in
the
preceding
section
and
we
find
that
when
he
comes
to
consider
the
ends
at
which
virtuous
action
is
aimed
the
only
really
ultimate
end
which
he
lays
down
is
the
object
of
rational
benevolence
as
commonly
conceived
the
happiness
of
other
men
he
regards
it
as
evident
that
each
man
as
a
rational
agent
is
bound
to
aim
at
the
happiness
of
other
men
indeed
in
his
view
it
can
only
be
stated
as
a
for
me
to
seek
my
own
happiness
so
far
as
i
consider
it
as
a
part
of
the
happiness
of
mankind
in
general
i
disagree
with
the
negative
side
of
this
statement
as
i
hold
with
butler
that
one
s
own
happiness
is
a
manifest
obligation
independently
of
one
s
relation
to
other
men
but
regarded
on
its
positive
side
kant
s
conclusion
appears
to
agree
to
a
great
extent
with
the
view
of
the
duty
of
rational
benevolence
that
i
have
given
though
i
am
not
altogether
able
to
assent
to
the
arguments
by
which
kant
arrives
at
his
conclusion
i
must
now
point
out
if
it
has
not
long
been
apparent
to
the
reader
that
the
principles
laid
down
in
do
not
specially
belong
to
intuitionism
in
the
restricted
sense
which
for
clear
distinction
of
methods
i
gave
to
this
term
at
the
outset
of
our
investigation
the
axiom
of
prudence
as
i
have
given
it
is
a
principle
implied
in
rational
egoism
as
commonly
accepted
again
the
axiom
of
justice
or
equity
as
above
stated
that
similar
cases
ought
to
be
treated
similarly
belongs
in
all
its
applications
to
utilitarianism
as
much
as
to
any
system
commonly
called
intuitional
while
the
axiom
of
rational
benevolence
is
in
my
view
required
as
a
rational
basis
for
the
utilitarian
system
accordingly
i
find
that
i
arrive
in
my
search
for
really
clear
and
certain
ethical
intuitions
at
the
fundamental
principle
of
utilitarianism
i
must
however
admit
that
the
thinkers
who
in
recent
times
have
taught
this
latter
system
have
not
for
the
most
part
expressly
tried
to
exhibit
the
truth
of
their
first
principle
by
means
of
any
such
procedure
as
that
above
given
still
when
i
examine
the
proof
of
the
principle
of
utility
presented
by
the
most
persuasive
and
probably
the
most
influential
among
english
expositors
of
utilitarianism
mill
i
find
the
need
of
some
such
procedure
to
complete
the
argument
very
plain
and
palpable
mill
begins
by
explaining
that
though
questions
of
ultimate
ends
are
not
amenable
to
proof
in
the
ordinary
and
popular
meaning
of
the
term
there
is
a
larger
meaning
of
the
word
proof
in
which
they
are
amenable
to
it
the
subject
he
says
is
within
the
cognisance
of
the
rational
faculty
considerations
may
be
presented
capable
of
determining
the
intellect
to
accept
the
utilitarian
he
subsequently
makes
clear
that
by
acceptance
of
the
utilitarian
formula
he
means
the
acceptance
not
of
the
agent
s
own
greatest
happiness
but
of
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
altogether
as
the
ultimate
end
of
human
action
and
standard
of
morality
to
promote
which
is
in
the
utilitarian
view
the
supreme
directive
rule
of
human
then
when
he
comes
to
give
the
proof
in
the
larger
sense
before
explained
of
this
rule
or
formula
he
offers
the
following
argument
the
sole
evidence
it
is
possible
to
produce
that
anything
is
desirable
is
that
people
do
actually
desire
it
no
reason
can
be
given
why
the
general
happiness
is
desirable
except
that
each
person
so
far
as
he
believes
it
to
be
attainable
desires
his
own
happiness
this
however
being
a
fact
we
have
not
only
all
the
proof
which
the
case
admits
of
but
all
which
it
is
possible
to
require
that
happiness
is
a
good
that
each
person
s
happiness
is
a
good
to
that
person
and
the
general
happiness
therefore
a
good
to
the
aggregate
of
he
then
goes
on
to
argue
that
pleasure
and
pleasure
alone
is
what
all
men
actually
do
desire
now
as
we
have
seen
it
is
as
a
standard
of
right
and
wrong
or
directive
rule
of
conduct
that
the
utilitarian
principle
is
put
forward
by
mill
hence
in
giving
as
a
statement
of
this
principle
that
the
general
happiness
is
he
must
be
understood
to
mean
and
his
whole
treatise
shows
that
he
does
mean
that
it
is
what
each
individual
to
desire
or
at
least
in
the
stricter
sense
of
ought
to
aim
at
realising
in
action
but
this
proposition
is
not
established
by
mill
s
reasoning
even
if
we
grant
that
what
is
actually
desired
may
be
legitimately
inferred
to
be
in
this
sense
desirable
for
an
aggregate
of
actual
desires
each
directed
towards
a
different
part
of
the
general
happiness
does
not
constitute
an
actual
desire
for
the
general
happiness
existing
in
any
individual
and
mill
would
certainly
not
contend
that
a
desire
which
does
not
exist
in
any
individual
can
possibly
exist
in
an
aggregate
of
individuals
there
being
therefore
no
actual
desire
so
far
as
this
reasoning
goes
for
the
general
happiness
the
proposition
that
the
general
happiness
is
desirable
can
not
be
in
this
way
established
so
that
there
is
a
gap
in
the
expressed
argument
which
can
i
think
only
be
filled
by
some
such
proposition
as
that
which
i
have
above
tried
to
exhibit
as
the
intuition
of
rational
benevolence
utilitarianism
is
thus
presented
as
the
final
form
into
which
intuitionism
tends
to
pass
when
the
demand
for
really
first
principles
is
rigorously
pressed
in
order
however
to
make
this
transition
logically
complete
we
require
to
interpret
universal
good
as
universal
and
this
interpretation
can
not
in
my
view
be
justified
by
arguing
as
mill
does
from
the
psychological
fact
that
happiness
is
the
sole
object
of
men
s
actual
desires
to
the
ethical
conclusion
that
it
alone
is
desirable
or
good
because
in
book
chap
iv
of
this
treatise
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
happiness
or
pleasure
is
not
the
only
object
that
each
for
himself
actually
desires
the
identification
of
ultimate
good
with
happiness
is
properly
to
be
reached
i
think
by
a
more
indirect
mode
of
reasoning
which
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
in
the
next
chapter
the
great
influence
at
present
exercised
by
kant
s
teaching
makes
it
worth
while
to
state
briefly
the
arguments
by
which
he
attempts
to
establish
the
duty
of
promoting
the
happiness
of
others
and
the
reasons
why
i
am
unable
to
regard
these
arguments
as
cogent
in
some
passages
he
attempts
to
exhibit
this
duty
as
an
immediate
deduction
from
his
fundamental
formula
act
from
a
maxim
that
thou
canst
will
to
be
universal
law
when
considered
in
combination
with
the
desire
for
the
kind
services
of
others
which
as
he
assumes
the
exigencies
of
life
must
arouse
in
every
man
the
maxim
he
says
that
each
should
be
left
to
take
care
of
himself
without
either
aid
or
interference
is
one
that
we
might
indeed
existing
as
a
universal
law
but
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
it
to
be
such
a
will
that
resolved
this
would
be
inconsistent
with
itself
for
many
cases
may
arise
in
which
the
individual
thus
willing
needs
the
benevolence
and
sympathy
of
others
rosenkrantz
similarly
elsewhere
anfangsgr
einleit
and
he
explains
at
more
length
that
the
which
necessarily
exists
in
every
one
involves
the
desire
of
being
loved
by
others
and
receiving
aid
from
them
in
case
of
need
we
thus
necessarily
constitute
ourselves
an
end
for
others
and
claim
that
they
shall
contribute
to
our
happiness
and
so
according
to
kant
s
fundamental
principle
we
must
recognise
the
duty
of
making
happiness
end
now
i
can
not
regard
this
reasoning
as
strictly
cogent
in
the
first
place
that
every
man
in
need
wishes
for
the
aid
of
others
is
an
empirical
proposition
which
kant
can
not
know
we
can
certainly
conceive
a
man
in
whom
the
spirit
of
independence
and
the
distaste
for
incurring
obligations
would
be
so
strong
that
he
would
choose
to
endure
any
privations
rather
than
receive
aid
from
others
but
even
granting
that
every
one
in
the
actual
moment
of
distress
must
necessarily
wish
for
the
assistance
of
others
still
a
strong
man
after
balancing
the
chances
of
life
may
easily
think
that
he
and
such
as
he
have
more
to
gain
on
the
whole
by
the
general
adoption
of
the
egoistic
maxim
benevolence
being
likely
to
bring
them
more
trouble
than
profit
in
other
passages
however
kant
reaches
the
same
conclusion
by
an
apparently
different
line
of
argument
he
lays
down
that
as
all
action
of
rational
beings
is
done
for
some
end
there
must
be
some
absolute
end
corresponding
to
the
absolute
rule
before
given
that
imposes
on
our
maxims
the
form
of
universal
law
this
absolute
end
prescribed
by
reason
necessarily
and
for
all
rational
beings
as
such
can
be
nothing
but
reason
itself
or
the
universe
of
rationals
for
what
the
rule
inculcates
is
in
fact
that
we
should
act
as
rational
units
in
a
universe
of
rational
beings
and
therefore
on
principles
conceived
and
embraced
as
universally
applicable
or
again
we
may
reach
the
same
result
negatively
for
all
particular
ends
at
which
men
aim
are
constituted
such
by
the
existence
of
impulses
directed
towards
some
particular
objects
now
we
can
not
tell
that
any
one
of
these
special
impulses
forms
part
of
the
constitution
of
all
men
and
therefore
we
can
not
state
it
as
an
absolute
dictate
of
reason
that
we
should
aim
at
any
such
special
object
if
then
we
thus
exclude
all
particular
empirical
ends
there
remains
only
the
principle
that
all
rational
beings
as
such
are
ends
to
each
or
as
kant
sometimes
puts
it
that
humanity
exists
as
an
end
in
now
says
kant
so
long
as
i
confine
myself
to
mere
with
others
i
do
not
positively
make
humanity
my
end
my
aims
remain
selfish
though
restricted
by
this
condition
of
with
others
my
action
therefore
is
not
truly
virtuous
for
virtue
is
exhibited
and
consists
in
the
effort
to
realise
the
end
of
reason
in
opposition
to
mere
selfish
impulses
therefore
the
ends
of
the
subject
which
is
itself
an
end
must
of
necessity
be
my
ends
if
the
representation
of
humanity
as
an
end
in
itself
is
to
have
its
full
weight
with
me
and
my
action
is
to
be
truly
rational
and
virtuous
here
again
i
can
not
accept
the
form
of
kant
s
argument
the
conception
of
humanity
as
an
end
in
itself
is
perplexing
because
by
an
end
we
commonly
mean
something
to
be
realised
whereas
humanity
is
as
kant
says
a
end
moreover
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
paralogism
in
the
deduction
of
the
principle
of
benevolence
by
means
of
this
conception
for
the
humanity
which
kant
maintains
to
be
an
end
in
itself
is
man
or
the
aggregate
of
men
so
far
as
but
the
subjective
ends
of
other
men
which
benevolence
directs
us
to
take
as
our
own
ends
would
seem
according
to
kant
s
own
view
to
depend
upon
and
correspond
to
their
impulses
their
empirical
desires
and
aversions
it
is
hard
to
see
why
if
man
a
rational
is
an
absolute
end
to
other
rational
beings
they
must
therefore
adopt
his
subjective
aims
as
determined
by
his
impulses

i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
peculiar
interest
and
value
of
the
ethical
thought
of
ancient
greece
indeed
through
a
large
part
of
the
present
work
the
influence
of
plato
and
aristotle
on
my
treatment
of
this
subject
has
been
greater
than
that
of
any
modern
writer
but
i
am
here
only
considering
the
value
of
the
general
principles
for
determining
what
ought
to
be
done
which
the
ancient
systems
profess
to
supply
the
following
remarks
apply
less
to
stoicism
especially
the
roman
stoicism
which
we
know
at
first
hand
in
the
writings
of
seneca
and
marcus
aurelius
in
which
the
relation
of
the
individual
man
to
humanity
generally
is
more
prominent
than
it
is
in
the
earlier
form
of
the
system
it
should
be
observed
that
in
determining
the
particulars
of
external
duty
the
stoics
to
some
extent
used
the
notion
nature
in
a
different
way
they
tried
to
derive
guidance
from
the
complex
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
exhibited
in
the
organic
world
but
since
in
their
view
the
whole
course
of
the
universe
was
both
perfect
and
completely
predetermined
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
obtain
from
any
observation
of
actual
existence
a
clear
and
consistent
principle
for
preferring
and
rejecting
alternatives
of
conduct
and
in
fact
their
most
characteristic
practical
precepts
show
a
curious
conflict
between
the
tendency
to
accept
what
was
customary
as
natural
and
the
tendency
to
reject
what
seemed
arbitrary
as
unreasonable

avoid
misapprehension
i
should
state
that
in
these
propositions
the
consideration
of
the
different
degrees
of
of
present
and
future
good
own
and
others
good
respectively
is
supposed
to
have
been
fully
taken
into
account
the
future
or
alien
good
is
judged
to
be
greater
it
may
however
be
thought
that
in
exhibiting
this
aspect
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
psychogonical
theory
leads
us
to
define
in
a
particular
way
the
general
notion
of
good
or
regarded
as
a
result
which
morality
has
a
demonstrable
natural
tendency
to
produce
this
point
will
be
considered

in
drawing
attention
to
clarke
s
system
i
ought
perhaps
to
remark
that
his
anxiety
to
exhibit
the
parallelism
between
ethical
and
mathematical
truth
on
which
locke
before
him
had
insisted
renders
his
general
terminology
inappropriate
and
occasionally
leads
him
into
downright
extravagances
it
is
patently
absurd
to
say
that
a
man
who
wilfully
acts
contrary
to
justice
wills
things
to
be
what
they
are
not
and
can
not
be
nor
are
relations
and
proportions
or
fitnesses
and
unfitnesses
of
things
very
suitable
designations
for
the
matter
of
moral
intuition
but
for
the
present
purpose
there
is
no
reason
to
dwell
on
these
defects
clarke
s
statement
of
the
rule
of
righteousness
with
respect
to
ourselves
i
pass
over
because
it
is
as
he
states
it
a
derivative
and
subordinate
rule
it
is
that
we
should
preserve
our
being
be
temperate
industrious
a
view
to
the
performance
of
which
of
course
supposes
duty
the
ultimate
and
absolute
rules
of
duty
already
determined
i
may
observe
that
the
reasonableness
of
prudence
or
is
only
recognised
by
clarke
indirectly
in
a
passage
which
i
quoted
before
pp
i
think
that
kant
in
applying
this
axiom
does
not
take
due
account
of
certain
restrictive
considerations
cf
chap
vii
of
this
book
and
also
book
iv
chap
kant
no
doubt
gives
the
agent
s
own
perfection
as
another
absolute
end
but
when
we
come
to
examine
his
notion
of
perfection
we
find
that
it
is
not
really
determinate
without
the
statement
of
other
ends
of
reason
for
the
accomplishment
of
which
we
are
to
perfect
ourselves
see
anfangsgr
theil
the
perfection
that
belongs
to
men
generally
can
be
nothing
else
than
the
cultivation
of
one
s
power
and
also
of
one
s
will
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
duty
in
see

at
the
end
of
the
chapter
on
the
relation
of
rational
egoism
to
rational
benevolence
which
i
regard
as
the
profoundest
problem
of
ethics
my
final
view
is
given
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
treatise

pp
and

ii
pp

iv
pp
it
has
been
suggested
that
i
have
overlooked
a
confusion
in
mill
s
mind
between
two
possible
meanings
of
the
term
desirable
what
can
be
desired
and
what
ought
to
be
desired
i
intended
to
show
by
the
two
first
sentences
of
this
paragraph
that
i
was
aware
of
this
confusion
but
thought
it
unnecessary
for
my
present
purpose
to
discuss
it
chapter
xiv
ultimate
good
at
the
outset
of
this
treatise
i
noticed
that
there
are
two
forms
in
which
the
object
of
ethical
inquiry
is
considered
it
is
sometimes
regarded
as
a
rule
or
rules
of
conduct
the
right
sometimes
as
an
end
or
ends
the
i
pointed
out
that
in
the
moral
consciousness
of
modern
europe
the
two
notions
are
distinct
since
while
it
is
commonly
thought
that
the
obligation
to
obey
moral
rules
is
absolute
it
is
not
commonly
held
that
the
whole
good
of
man
lies
in
such
obedience
this
view
we
may
say
is
vaguely
and
respectfully
but
unmistakably
repudiated
as
a
stoical
paradox
the
ultimate
good
or
wellbeing
of
man
is
rather
regarded
as
an
ulterior
result
the
connexion
of
which
with
his
right
conduct
is
indeed
commonly
held
to
be
certain
but
is
frequently
conceived
as
supernatural
and
so
beyond
the
range
of
independent
ethical
speculation
but
now
if
the
conclusions
of
the
preceding
chapters
are
to
be
trusted
it
would
seem
that
the
practical
determination
of
right
conduct
depends
on
the
determination
of
ultimate
good
for
we
have
seen
that
most
of
the
commonly
received
maxims
of
duty
even
of
those
which
at
first
sight
appear
absolute
and
independent
are
found
when
closely
examined
to
contain
an
implicit
subordination
to
the
more
general
principles
of
prudence
and
benevolence
and
that
no
principles
except
these
and
the
formal
principle
of
justice
or
equity
can
be
admitted
as
at
once
intuitively
clear
and
certain
while
again
these
principles
themselves
so
far
as
they
are
may
be
stated
as
precepts
to
seek
one
s
own
good
on
the
whole
repressing
all
seductive
impulses
prompting
to
undue
preference
of
particular
goods
and
others
good
no
less
than
one
s
own
repressing
any
undue
preference
for
one
individual
over
another
thus
we
are
brought
round
again
to
the
old
question
with
which
ethical
speculation
in
europe
began
what
is
the
ultimate
good
for
man
though
not
in
the
egoistic
form
in
which
the
old
question
was
raised
when
however
we
examine
the
controversies
to
which
this
question
originally
led
we
see
that
the
investigation
which
has
brought
us
round
to
it
has
tended
definitely
to
exclude
one
of
the
answers
which
early
moral
reflection
was
disposed
to
give
to
it
for
to
say
that
general
good
consists
solely
in
general
virtue
if
we
mean
by
virtue
conformity
to
such
prescriptions
and
prohibitions
as
make
up
the
main
part
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
would
obviously
involve
us
in
a
logical
circle
since
we
have
seen
that
the
exact
determination
of
these
prescriptions
and
prohibitions
must
depend
on
the
definition
of
this
general
good
nor
i
conceive
can
this
argument
be
evaded
by
adopting
the
view
of
what
i
have
called
æsthetic
intuitionism
and
regarding
virtues
as
excellences
of
conduct
clearly
discernible
by
trained
insight
although
their
nature
does
not
admit
of
being
stated
in
definite
formulæ
for
our
notions
of
special
virtues
do
not
really
become
more
independent
by
becoming
more
indefinite
they
still
contain
though
perhaps
more
latently
the
same
reference
to
good
or
wellbeing
as
an
ultimate
standard
this
appears
clearly
when
we
consider
any
virtue
in
relation
to
the
cognate
vice
or
at
least
into
which
it
tends
to
pass
over
when
pushed
to
an
extreme
or
exhibited
under
inappropriate
conditions
for
example
common
sense
may
seem
to
regard
liberality
frugality
courage
placability
as
intrinsically
desirable
but
when
we
consider
their
relation
respectively
to
profusion
meanness
foolhardiness
weakness
we
find
that
common
sense
draws
the
line
in
each
case
not
by
immediate
intuition
but
by
reference
either
to
some
definite
maxim
of
duty
or
to
the
general
notion
of
good
or
wellbeing
and
similarly
when
we
ask
at
what
point
candour
generosity
humility
cease
to
be
virtues
by
becoming
other
qualities
commonly
admired
such
as
energy
zeal
thoughtfulness
are
obviously
regarded
as
virtues
only
when
they
are
directed
to
good
ends
in
short
the
only
virtues
which
can
be
thought
to
be
essentially
and
always
such
and
incapable
of
excess
are
such
qualities
as
wisdom
universal
benevolence
and
in
a
sense
justice
of
which
the
notions
manifestly
involve
this
notion
of
good
supposed
already
determinate
wisdom
is
insight
into
good
and
the
means
to
good
benevolence
is
exhibited
in
the
purposive
actions
called
doing
good
justice
when
regarded
as
essentially
and
always
a
virtue
lies
in
distributing
good
or
evil
impartially
according
to
right
rules
if
then
we
are
asked
what
is
this
good
which
it
is
excellent
to
know
to
bestow
on
others
to
distribute
impartially
it
would
be
obviously
absurd
to
reply
that
it
is
just
this
knowledge
these
beneficent
purposes
this
impartial
distribution
nor
again
can
i
perceive
that
this
difficulty
is
in
any
way
met
by
regarding
virtue
as
a
quality
of
character
rather
than
of
conduct
and
expressing
the
moral
law
in
the
form
be
this
instead
of
the
form
do
from
a
practical
point
of
view
indeed
i
fully
recognise
the
importance
of
urging
that
men
should
aim
at
an
ideal
of
character
and
consider
action
in
its
effects
on
character
but
i
can
not
infer
from
this
that
character
and
its
elements
faculties
habits
or
dispositions
of
any
kind
are
the
constituents
of
ultimate
good
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opposite
is
implied
in
the
very
conception
of
a
faculty
or
disposition
it
can
only
be
defined
as
a
tendency
to
act
or
feel
in
a
certain
way
under
certain
conditions
and
such
a
tendency
appears
to
me
clearly
not
valuable
in
itself
but
for
the
acts
and
feelings
in
which
it
takes
effect
or
for
the
ulterior
consequences
of
these
which
consequences
again
can
not
be
regarded
as
ultimate
good
so
long
as
they
are
merely
conceived
as
modifications
of
faculties
dispositions
etc
when
therefore
i
say
that
effects
on
character
are
important
it
is
a
summary
way
of
saying
that
by
the
laws
of
our
mental
constitution
the
present
act
or
feeling
is
a
cause
tending
to
modify
importantly
our
acts
and
feelings
in
the
indefinite
future
the
comparatively
permanent
result
supposed
to
be
produced
in
the
mind
or
soul
being
a
tendency
that
will
show
itself
in
an
indefinite
number
of
particular
acts
and
feelings
may
easily
be
more
important
in
relation
to
the
ultimate
end
than
a
single
act
or
the
transient
feeling
of
a
single
moment
but
its
comparative
permanence
appears
to
me
no
ground
for
regarding
it
as
itself
a
constituent
of
ultimate
good
so
far
however
i
have
been
speaking
only
of
particular
virtues
as
exhibited
in
conduct
judged
to
be
objectively
right
and
it
may
be
argued
that
this
is
too
external
a
view
of
the
virtue
that
claims
to
constitute
ultimate
good
it
may
be
said
that
the
difficulty
that
i
have
been
urging
vanishes
if
we
penetrate
beyond
the
particular
virtues
to
the
root
and
essence
of
virtue
in
general
the
determination
of
the
will
to
do
whatever
is
judged
to
be
right
and
to
aim
at
realising
whatever
is
judged
to
be
best
since
this
subjective
rightness
or
goodness
of
will
being
independent
of
knowledge
of
what
is
objectively
right
or
good
is
independent
of
that
presupposition
of
good
as
already
known
and
determined
which
we
have
seen
to
be
implied
in
the
common
conceptions
of
virtue
as
manifested
in
outward
acts
i
admit
that
if
subjective
rightness
or
goodness
of
will
is
affirmed
to
be
the
ultimate
good
the
affirmation
does
not
exactly
involve
the
logical
difficulty
that
i
have
been
urging
none
the
less
is
it
fundamentally
opposed
to
common
sense
since
the
very
notion
of
subjective
rightness
or
goodness
of
will
implies
an
objective
standard
which
it
directs
us
to
seek
but
does
not
profess
to
supply
it
would
be
a
palpable
and
violent
paradox
to
set
before
the
mind
no
end
except
this
itself
and
to
affirm
this
to
be
the
sole
ultimate
good
denying
that
any
effects
of
right
volition
can
be
in
themselves
good
except
the
subjective
rightness
of
future
volitions
whether
of
self
or
of
others
it
is
true
that
no
rule
can
be
recognised
by
any
reasonable
individual
as
more
authoritative
than
the
rule
of
doing
what
he
judges
to
be
right
for
in
deliberating
with
a
view
to
my
own
immediate
action
i
can
not
distinguish
between
doing
what
is
objectively
right
and
realising
my
own
subjective
conception
of
rightness
but
we
are
continually
forced
to
make
the
distinction
as
regards
the
actions
of
others
and
to
judge
that
conduct
may
be
objectively
wrong
though
subjectively
right
and
we
continually
judge
conduct
to
be
objectively
wrong
because
it
tends
to
cause
pain
and
loss
of
happiness
to
others
apart
from
any
effect
on
the
subjective
rightness
of
their
volitions
it
is
as
so
judging
that
we
commonly
recognise
the
mischief
and
danger
of
fanaticism
meaning
by
a
fanatic
a
man
who
resolutely
and
unswervingly
carries
out
his
own
conception
of
rightness
when
it
is
a
plainly
mistaken
conception
the
same
result
may
be
reached
even
without
supposing
so
palpable
a
divorce
between
subjective
and
objective
rightness
of
volition
as
is
implied
in
the
notion
of
fanaticism
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
though
the
dictates
of
reason
are
always
to
be
obeyed
it
does
not
follow
that
the
dictation
of
reason
the
predominance
of
consciously
moral
over
motives
is
to
be
promoted
without
limits
and
indeed
common
sense
appears
to
hold
that
some
things
are
likely
to
be
better
done
if
they
are
done
from
other
motives
than
conscious
obedience
to
practical
reason
or
conscience
it
thus
becomes
a
practical
question
how
far
the
dictation
of
reason
the
predominance
of
moral
choice
and
moral
effort
in
human
life
is
a
result
to
be
aimed
at
and
the
admission
of
this
question
implies
that
conscious
rightness
of
volition
is
not
the
sole
ultimate
good
on
the
whole
then
we
may
conclude
that
neither
subjective
rightness
or
goodness
of
volition
as
distinct
from
objective
nor
virtuous
character
except
as
manifested
or
realised
in
virtuous
conduct
can
be
regarded
as
constituting
ultimate
good
while
again
we
are
precluded
from
identifying
ultimate
good
with
virtuous
conduct
because
our
conceptions
of
virtuous
conduct
under
the
different
heads
or
aspects
denoted
by
the
names
of
the
particular
virtues
have
been
found
to
presuppose
the
prior
determination
of
the
notion
of
good
that
good
which
virtuous
conduct
is
conceived
as
producing
or
promoting
or
rightly
distributing
and
what
has
been
said
of
virtue
seems
to
me
still
more
manifestly
true
of
the
other
talents
gifts
and
graces
which
make
up
the
common
notion
of
human
excellence
or
perfection
however
immediately
the
excellent
quality
of
such
gifts
and
skills
may
be
recognised
and
admired
reflection
shows
that
they
are
only
valuable
on
account
of
the
good
or
desirable
conscious
life
in
which
they
are
or
will
be
actualised
or
which
will
be
somehow
promoted
by
their
exercise
shall
we
then
say
that
ultimate
good
is
good
or
desirable
conscious
or
sentient
life
of
which
virtuous
action
is
one
element
but
not
the
sole
constituent
this
seems
in
harmony
with
common
sense
and
the
fact
that
particular
virtues
and
talents
and
gifts
are
largely
valued
as
means
to
ulterior
good
does
not
necessarily
prevent
us
from
regarding
their
exercise
as
also
an
element
of
ultimate
good
just
as
the
fact
that
physical
action
nutrition
and
repose
duly
proportioned
and
combined
are
means
to
the
maintenance
of
our
animal
life
does
not
prevent
us
from
regarding
them
as
indispensable
elements
of
such
life
still
it
seems
difficult
to
conceive
any
kind
of
activity
or
process
as
both
means
and
end
from
precisely
the
same
point
of
view
and
in
respect
of
precisely
the
same
quality
and
in
both
the
cases
above
mentioned
it
is
i
think
easy
to
distinguish
the
aspect
in
which
the
activities
or
processes
in
question
are
to
be
regarded
as
means
from
that
in
which
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
in
themselves
good
or
desirable
let
us
examine
this
first
in
the
case
of
the
physical
processes
it
is
in
their
purely
physical
aspect
as
complex
processes
of
corporeal
change
that
they
are
means
to
the
maintenance
of
life
but
so
long
as
we
confine
our
attention
to
their
corporeal
aspect
regarding
them
merely
as
complex
movements
of
certain
particles
of
organised
matter
it
seems
impossible
to
attribute
to
these
movements
considered
in
themselves
either
goodness
or
badness
i
can
not
conceive
it
to
be
an
ultimate
end
of
rational
action
to
secure
that
these
complex
movements
should
be
of
one
kind
rather
than
another
or
that
they
should
be
continued
for
a
longer
rather
than
a
shorter
period
in
short
if
a
certain
quality
of
human
life
is
that
which
is
ultimately
desirable
it
must
belong
to
human
life
regarded
on
its
psychical
side
or
briefly
consciousness
but
again
it
is
not
all
life
regarded
on
its
psychical
side
which
we
can
judge
to
be
ultimately
desirable
since
psychical
life
as
known
to
us
includes
pain
as
well
as
pleasure
and
so
far
as
it
is
painful
it
is
not
desirable
i
can
not
therefore
accept
a
view
of
the
wellbeing
or
welfare
of
human
beings
as
of
other
living
things
which
is
suggested
by
current
zoological
conceptions
and
apparently
maintained
with
more
or
less
definiteness
by
influential
writers
according
to
which
when
we
attribute
goodness
or
badness
to
the
manner
of
existence
of
any
living
organism
we
should
be
understood
to
attribute
to
it
a
tendency
either
to
or
to
the
preservation
of
the
community
or
race
to
which
it
belongs
so
that
what
wellbeing
adds
to
mere
being
is
just
promise
of
future
being
it
appears
to
me
that
this
doctrine
needs
only
to
be
distinctly
contemplated
in
order
to
be
rejected
if
all
life
were
as
little
desirable
as
some
portions
of
it
have
been
in
my
own
experience
and
in
that
i
believe
of
all
or
most
men
i
should
judge
all
tendency
to
the
preservation
of
it
to
be
unmitigatedly
bad
actually
no
doubt
as
we
generally
hold
that
human
life
even
as
now
lived
has
on
the
average
a
balance
of
happiness
we
regard
what
is
preservative
of
life
as
generally
good
and
what
is
destructive
of
life
as
bad
and
i
quite
admit
that
a
most
fundamentally
important
part
of
the
function
of
morality
consists
in
maintaining
such
habits
and
sentiments
as
are
necessary
to
the
continued
existence
in
full
numbers
of
a
society
of
human
beings
under
their
actual
conditions
of
life
but
this
is
not
because
the
mere
existence
of
human
organisms
even
if
prolonged
to
eternity
appears
to
me
in
any
way
desirable
it
is
only
assumed
to
be
so
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
accompanied
by
consciousness
on
the
whole
desirable
it
is
therefore
this
desirable
consciousness
which
we
must
regard
as
ultimate
good
in
the
same
way
so
far
as
we
judge
virtuous
activity
to
be
a
part
of
ultimate
good
it
is
i
conceive
because
the
consciousness
attending
it
is
judged
to
be
in
itself
desirable
for
the
virtuous
agent
though
at
the
same
time
this
consideration
does
not
adequately
represent
the
importance
of
virtue
to
human
wellbeing
since
we
have
to
consider
its
value
as
a
means
as
well
as
its
value
as
an
end
we
may
make
the
distinction
clearer
by
considering
whether
virtuous
life
would
remain
on
the
whole
good
for
the
virtuous
agent
if
we
suppose
it
combined
with
extreme
pain
the
affirmative
answer
to
this
question
was
strongly
supported
in
greek
philosophical
discussion
but
it
is
a
paradox
from
which
a
modern
thinker
would
recoil
he
would
hardly
venture
to
assert
that
the
portion
of
life
spent
by
a
martyr
in
tortures
was
in
itself
desirable
though
it
might
be
his
duty
to
suffer
the
pain
with
a
view
to
the
good
of
others
and
even
his
interest
to
suffer
it
with
a
view
to
his
own
ultimate
happiness
if
then
ultimate
good
can
only
be
conceived
as
desirable
consciousness
including
the
consciousness
of
virtue
as
a
part
but
only
as
a
part
are
we
to
identify
this
notion
with
happiness
or
pleasure
and
say
with
the
utilitarians
that
general
good
is
general
happiness
many
would
at
this
point
of
the
discussion
regard
this
conclusion
as
inevitable
to
say
that
all
other
things
called
good
are
only
means
to
the
end
of
making
conscious
life
better
or
more
desirable
seems
to
them
the
same
as
saying
that
they
are
means
to
the
end
of
happiness
but
very
important
distinctions
remain
to
be
considered
according
to
the
view
taken
in
a
previous
chapter
in
affirming
ultimate
good
to
be
happiness
or
pleasure
we
imply
that
nothing
is
desirable
except
desirable
feelings
and
that
the
desirability
of
each
feeling
is
only
directly
cognisable
by
the
sentient
individual
at
the
time
of
feeling
it
and
that
therefore
this
particular
judgment
of
the
sentient
individual
must
be
taken
as
final
on
the
question
how
far
each
element
of
feeling
has
the
quality
of
ultimate
good
now
no
one
i
conceive
would
estimate
in
any
other
way
the
desirability
of
feeling
considered
merely
as
feeling
but
it
may
be
urged
that
our
conscious
experience
includes
besides
feelings
cognitions
and
volitions
and
that
the
desirability
of
these
must
be
taken
into
account
and
is
not
to
be
estimated
by
the
standard
above
stated
i
think
however
that
when
we
reflect
on
a
cognition
as
a
transient
fact
of
an
individual
s
psychical
experience
distinguishing
it
on
the
one
hand
from
the
feeling
that
normally
accompanies
it
and
on
the
other
hand
from
that
relation
of
the
knowing
mind
to
the
object
known
which
is
implied
in
the
term
true
or
valid
cognition
it
is
seen
to
be
an
element
of
consciousness
quite
neutral
in
respect
of
desirability
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
volitions
when
we
abstract
from
their
concomitant
feelings
and
their
relation
to
an
objective
norm
or
ideal
as
well
as
from
all
their
consequences
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
in
ordinary
thought
certain
states
of
consciousness
such
as
cognition
of
truth
contemplation
of
beauty
volition
to
realise
freedom
or
virtue
are
sometimes
judged
to
be
preferable
on
other
grounds
than
their
pleasantness
but
the
general
explanation
of
this
seems
to
be
as
was
suggested
in
book
ii
chap
ii
that
what
in
such
cases
we
really
prefer
is
not
the
present
consciousness
itself
but
either
effects
on
future
consciousness
more
or
less
distinctly
foreseen
or
else
something
in
the
objective
relations
of
the
conscious
being
not
strictly
included
in
his
present
consciousness
the
second
of
these
alternatives
may
perhaps
be
made
clearer
by
some
illustrations
a
man
may
prefer
the
mental
state
of
apprehending
truth
to
the
state
of
on
generally
accredited
fictions
while
recognising
that
the
former
state
may
be
more
painful
than
the
latter
and
independently
of
any
effect
which
he
expects
either
state
to
have
upon
his
subsequent
consciousness
here
on
my
view
the
real
object
of
preference
is
not
the
consciousness
of
knowing
truth
considered
merely
as
consciousness
the
element
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
in
this
being
more
than
outweighed
by
the
concomitant
pain
but
the
relation
between
the
mind
and
something
else
which
as
the
very
notion
of
truth
implies
is
whatever
it
is
independently
of
our
cognition
of
it
and
which
i
therefore
call
objective
this
may
become
more
clear
if
we
imagine
ourselves
learning
afterwards
that
what
we
took
for
truth
is
not
really
such
for
in
this
case
we
should
certainly
feel
that
our
preference
had
been
mistaken
whereas
if
our
choice
had
really
been
between
two
elements
of
transient
consciousness
its
reasonableness
could
not
be
affected
by
any
subsequent
discovery
similarly
a
man
may
prefer
freedom
and
penury
to
a
life
of
luxurious
servitude
not
because
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
being
free
outweighs
in
prospect
all
the
comforts
and
securities
that
the
other
life
would
afford
but
because
he
has
a
predominant
aversion
to
that
relation
between
his
will
and
the
will
of
another
which
we
call
slavery
or
again
a
philosopher
may
choose
what
he
conceives
as
inner
freedom
the
consistent
of
the
will
rather
than
the
gratifications
of
appetite
though
recognising
that
the
latter
are
more
desirable
considered
merely
as
transient
feelings
in
either
case
he
will
be
led
to
regard
his
preference
as
mistaken
if
he
be
afterwards
persuaded
that
his
conception
of
freedom
or
was
illusory
that
we
are
all
slaves
of
circumstances
destiny
etc
so
again
the
preference
of
conformity
to
virtue
or
contemplation
of
beauty
to
a
state
of
consciousness
recognised
as
more
pleasant
seems
to
depend
on
a
belief
that
one
s
conception
of
virtue
or
beauty
corresponds
to
an
ideal
to
some
extent
objective
and
valid
for
all
minds
apart
from
any
consideration
of
future
consequences
we
should
generally
agree
that
a
man
who
sacrificed
happiness
to
an
erroneous
conception
of
virtue
or
beauty
made
a
mistaken
choice
still
it
may
be
said
that
this
is
merely
a
question
of
definition
that
we
may
take
conscious
life
in
a
wide
sense
so
as
to
include
the
objective
relations
of
the
conscious
being
implied
in
our
notions
of
virtue
truth
beauty
freedom
and
that
from
this
point
of
view
we
may
regard
cognition
of
truth
contemplation
of
beauty
free
or
virtuous
action
as
in
some
measure
preferable
alternatives
to
pleasure
or
happiness
even
though
we
admit
that
happiness
must
be
included
as
a
part
of
ultimate
good
in
this
case
the
principle
of
rational
benevolence
which
was
stated
in
the
last
chapter
as
an
indubitable
intuition
of
the
practical
reason
would
not
direct
us
to
the
pursuit
of
universal
happiness
alone
but
of
these
ideal
goods
as
well
as
ends
ultimately
desirable
for
mankind
generally
i
think
however
that
this
view
ought
not
to
commend
itself
to
the
sober
judgment
of
reflective
persons
in
order
to
show
this
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
use
the
same
twofold
procedure
that
i
before
requested
him
to
employ
in
considering
the
absolute
and
independent
validity
of
common
moral
precepts
i
appeal
firstly
to
his
intuitive
judgment
after
due
consideration
of
the
question
when
fairly
placed
before
it
and
secondly
to
a
comprehensive
comparison
of
the
ordinary
judgments
of
mankind
as
regards
the
first
argument
to
me
at
least
it
seems
clear
after
reflection
that
these
objective
relations
of
the
conscious
subject
when
distinguished
from
the
consciousness
accompanying
and
resulting
from
them
are
not
ultimately
and
intrinsically
desirable
any
more
than
material
or
other
objects
are
when
considered
apart
from
any
relation
to
conscious
existence
admitting
that
we
have
actual
experience
of
such
preferences
as
have
just
been
described
of
which
the
ultimate
object
is
something
that
is
not
merely
consciousness
it
still
seems
to
me
that
when
to
use
butler
s
phrase
we
sit
down
in
a
cool
hour
we
can
only
justify
to
ourselves
the
importance
that
we
attach
to
any
of
these
objects
by
considering
its
conduciveness
in
one
way
or
another
to
the
happiness
of
sentient
beings
the
second
argument
that
refers
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
obviously
can
not
be
made
completely
cogent
since
as
above
stated
several
cultivated
persons
do
habitually
judge
that
knowledge
art
not
to
speak
of
virtue
are
ends
independently
of
the
pleasure
derived
from
them
but
we
may
urge
not
only
that
all
these
elements
of
ideal
good
are
productive
of
pleasure
in
various
ways
but
also
that
they
seem
to
obtain
the
commendation
of
common
sense
roughly
speaking
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
this
productiveness
this
seems
obviously
true
of
beauty
and
will
hardly
be
denied
in
respect
of
any
kind
of
social
ideal
it
is
paradoxical
to
maintain
that
any
degree
of
freedom
or
any
form
of
social
order
would
still
be
commonly
regarded
as
desirable
even
if
we
were
certain
that
it
had
no
tendency
to
promote
the
general
happiness
the
case
of
knowledge
is
rather
more
complex
but
certainly
common
sense
is
most
impressed
with
the
value
of
knowledge
when
its
fruitfulness
has
been
demonstrated
it
is
however
aware
that
experience
has
frequently
shown
how
knowledge
long
fruitless
may
become
unexpectedly
fruitful
and
how
light
may
be
shed
on
one
part
of
the
field
of
knowledge
from
another
apparently
remote
and
even
if
any
particular
branch
of
scientific
pursuit
could
be
shown
to
be
devoid
of
even
this
indirect
utility
it
would
still
deserve
some
respect
on
utilitarian
grounds
both
as
furnishing
to
the
inquirer
the
refined
and
innocent
pleasures
of
curiosity
and
because
the
intellectual
disposition
which
it
exhibits
and
sustains
is
likely
on
the
whole
to
produce
fruitful
knowledge
still
in
cases
approximating
to
this
last
common
sense
is
somewhat
disposed
to
complain
of
the
misdirection
of
valuable
effort
so
that
the
meed
of
honour
commonly
paid
to
science
seems
to
be
graduated
though
perhaps
unconsciously
by
a
tolerably
exact
utilitarian
scale
certainly
the
moment
the
legitimacy
of
any
branch
of
scientific
inquiry
is
seriously
disputed
as
in
the
recent
case
of
vivisection
the
controversy
on
both
sides
is
generally
conducted
on
an
avowedly
utilitarian
basis
the
case
of
virtue
requires
special
consideration
since
the
encouragement
in
each
other
of
virtuous
impulses
and
dispositions
is
a
main
aim
of
men
s
ordinary
moral
discourse
so
that
even
to
raise
the
question
whether
this
encouragement
can
go
too
far
has
a
paradoxical
air
still
our
experience
includes
rare
and
exceptional
cases
in
which
the
concentration
of
effort
on
the
cultivation
of
virtue
has
seemed
to
have
effects
adverse
to
general
happiness
through
being
intensified
to
the
point
of
moral
fanaticism
and
so
involving
a
neglect
of
other
conditions
of
happiness
if
then
we
admit
as
actual
or
possible
such
infelicific
effects
of
the
cultivation
of
virtue
i
think
we
shall
also
generally
admit
that
in
the
case
supposed
conduciveness
to
general
happiness
should
be
the
criterion
for
deciding
how
far
the
cultivation
of
virtue
should
be
carried
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
allowed
that
we
find
in
common
sense
an
aversion
to
admit
happiness
when
explained
to
mean
a
sum
of
pleasures
to
be
the
sole
ultimate
end
and
standard
of
right
conduct
but
this
i
think
can
be
fully
accounted
for
by
the
following
considerations
i
the
term
pleasure
is
not
commonly
used
so
as
to
include
clearly
kinds
of
consciousness
which
we
desire
to
retain
or
reproduce
in
ordinary
usage
it
suggests
too
prominently
the
coarser
and
commoner
kinds
of
such
feelings
and
it
is
difficult
even
for
those
who
are
trying
to
use
it
scientifically
to
free
their
minds
altogether
from
the
associations
of
ordinary
usage
and
to
mean
by
pleasure
only
desirable
consciousness
or
feeling
of
whatever
kind
again
our
knowledge
of
human
life
continually
suggests
to
us
instances
of
pleasures
which
will
inevitably
involve
as
concomitant
or
consequent
either
a
greater
amount
of
pain
or
a
loss
of
more
important
pleasures
and
we
naturally
shrink
from
including
even
hypothetically
in
our
conception
of
ultimate
good
these
in
bentham
s
phrase
impure
pleasures
especially
since
we
have
in
many
cases
moral
or
æsthetic
instincts
warning
us
against
such
pleasures
ii
we
have
seen
that
many
important
pleasures
can
only
be
felt
on
condition
of
our
experiencing
desires
for
other
things
than
pleasure
thus
the
very
acceptance
of
pleasure
as
the
ultimate
end
of
conduct
involves
the
practical
rule
that
it
is
not
always
to
be
made
the
conscious
end
hence
even
if
we
are
considering
merely
the
good
of
one
human
being
taken
alone
excluding
from
our
view
all
effects
of
his
conduct
on
others
still
the
reluctance
of
common
sense
to
regard
pleasure
as
the
sole
thing
ultimately
desirable
may
be
justified
by
the
consideration
that
human
beings
tend
to
be
less
happy
if
they
are
exclusively
occupied
with
the
desire
of
personal
happiness
as
was
before
shown
we
shall
miss
the
valuable
pleasures
which
attend
the
exercise
of
the
benevolent
affections
if
we
do
not
experience
genuinely
disinterested
impulses
to
procure
happiness
for
others
which
are
in
fact
implied
in
the
notion
of
benevolent
affections
iii
but
again
i
hold
as
was
expounded
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
disinterested
benevolence
is
not
only
thus
generally
in
harmony
with
rational
but
also
in
another
sense
and
independently
rational
that
is
reason
shows
me
that
if
my
happiness
is
desirable
and
a
good
the
equal
happiness
of
any
other
person
must
be
equally
desirable
now
when
happiness
is
spoken
of
as
the
sole
ultimate
good
of
man
the
idea
most
commonly
suggested
is
that
each
individual
is
to
seek
his
own
happiness
at
the
expense
if
necessary
or
at
any
rate
to
the
neglect
of
that
of
others
and
this
offends
both
our
sympathetic
and
our
rational
regard
for
others
happiness
it
is
in
fact
rather
the
end
of
egoistic
than
of
universalistic
hedonism
to
which
common
sense
feels
an
aversion
and
certainly
one
s
individual
happiness
is
in
many
respects
an
unsatisfactory
mark
for
one
s
supreme
aim
apart
from
any
direct
collision
into
which
the
exclusive
pursuit
of
it
may
bring
us
with
rational
or
sympathetic
benevolence
it
does
not
possess
the
characteristics
which
as
aristotle
says
we
divine
to
belong
to
ultimate
good
being
so
far
at
least
as
it
can
be
empirically
foreseen
so
narrow
and
limited
of
such
necessarily
brief
duration
and
so
shifting
and
insecure
while
it
lasts
but
universal
happiness
desirable
consciousness
or
feeling
for
the
innumerable
multitude
of
sentient
beings
present
and
to
come
seems
an
end
that
satisfies
our
imagination
by
its
vastness
and
sustains
our
resolution
by
its
comparative
security
it
may
however
be
said
that
if
we
require
the
individual
to
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
the
greater
happiness
of
others
on
the
ground
that
it
is
reasonable
to
do
so
we
really
assign
to
the
individual
a
different
ultimate
end
from
that
which
we
lay
down
as
the
ultimate
good
of
the
universe
of
sentient
beings
since
we
direct
him
to
take
as
ultimate
happiness
for
the
universe
but
conformity
to
reason
for
himself
i
admit
the
substantial
truth
of
this
statement
though
i
should
avoid
the
language
as
tending
to
obscure
the
distinction
before
explained
between
obeying
the
dictates
and
promoting
the
dictation
of
reason
but
granting
the
alleged
difference
i
do
not
see
that
it
constitutes
an
argument
against
the
view
here
maintained
since
the
individual
is
essentially
and
fundamentally
different
from
the
larger
whole
the
universe
of
sentient
beings
of
which
he
is
conscious
of
being
a
part
just
because
he
has
a
known
relation
to
similar
parts
of
the
same
whole
while
the
whole
itself
has
no
such
relation
i
accordingly
see
no
inconsistency
in
holding
that
while
it
be
reasonable
for
the
aggregate
of
sentient
beings
if
it
could
act
collectively
to
aim
at
its
own
happiness
only
as
an
ultimate
end
and
would
be
reasonable
for
any
individual
to
do
the
same
if
he
were
the
only
sentient
being
in
the
universe
it
may
yet
be
reasonable
for
an
individual
to
sacrifice
his
own
good
or
happiness
for
the
greater
happiness
of
others
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
in
the
earlier
age
of
ethical
thought
which
greek
philosophy
represents
men
sometimes
judged
an
act
to
be
good
the
even
while
recognising
that
its
consequences
would
be
on
the
whole
painful
to
him
as
a
heroic
exchange
of
a
life
full
of
happiness
for
a
painful
death
at
the
call
of
duty
i
attribute
this
partly
to
a
confusion
of
thought
between
what
it
is
reasonable
for
an
individual
to
desire
when
he
considers
his
own
existence
alone
and
what
he
must
recognise
as
reasonably
to
be
desired
when
he
takes
the
point
of
view
of
a
larger
whole
partly
again
to
a
faith
deeply
rooted
in
the
moral
consciousness
of
mankind
that
there
can
not
be
really
and
ultimately
any
conflict
between
the
two
kinds
of
reasonableness
but
when
reasonable
has
been
clearly
distinguished
from
conscience
as
it
is
by
butler
and
his
followers
we
find
it
is
naturally
understood
to
mean
desire
for
one
s
own
happiness
so
that
in
fact
the
interpretation
of
one
s
own
good
which
was
almost
peculiar
in
ancient
thought
to
the
cyrenaic
and
epicurean
heresies
is
adopted
by
some
of
the
most
orthodox
of
modern
moralists
indeed
it
often
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
these
latter
that
this
notion
can
have
any
other
interpretation
if
then
when
any
one
hypothetically
concentrates
his
attention
on
himself
good
is
naturally
and
almost
inevitably
conceived
to
be
pleasure
we
may
reasonably
conclude
that
the
good
of
any
number
of
similar
beings
whatever
their
mutual
relations
may
be
can
not
be
essentially
different
in
quality
iv
but
lastly
from
the
universal
point
of
view
no
less
than
from
that
of
the
individual
it
seems
true
that
happiness
is
likely
to
be
better
attained
if
the
extent
to
which
we
set
ourselves
consciously
to
aim
at
it
be
carefully
restricted
and
this
not
only
because
action
is
likely
to
be
more
effective
if
our
effort
is
temporarily
concentrated
on
the
realisation
of
more
limited
ends
though
this
is
no
doubt
an
important
reason
but
also
because
the
fullest
development
of
happy
life
for
each
individual
seems
to
require
that
he
should
have
other
external
objects
of
interest
besides
the
happiness
of
other
conscious
beings
and
thus
we
may
conclude
that
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
objects
before
mentioned
virtue
truth
freedom
beauty
their
own
is
indirectly
and
secondarily
though
not
primarily
and
absolutely
rational
on
account
not
only
of
the
happiness
that
will
result
from
their
attainment
but
also
of
that
which
springs
from
their
disinterested
pursuit
while
yet
if
we
ask
for
a
final
criterion
of
the
comparative
value
of
the
different
objects
of
men
s
enthusiastic
pursuit
and
of
the
limits
within
which
each
may
legitimately
engross
the
attention
of
mankind
we
shall
none
the
less
conceive
it
to
depend
upon
the
degree
in
which
they
respectively
conduce
to
happiness
if
however
this
view
be
rejected
it
remains
to
consider
whether
we
can
frame
any
other
coherent
account
of
ultimate
good
if
we
are
not
to
systematise
human
activities
by
taking
universal
happiness
as
their
common
end
on
what
other
principles
are
we
to
systematise
them
it
should
be
observed
that
these
principles
must
not
only
enable
us
to
compare
among
themselves
the
values
of
the
different
ends
which
we
have
been
considering
but
must
also
provide
a
common
standard
for
comparing
these
values
with
that
of
happiness
unless
we
are
prepared
to
adopt
the
paradoxical
position
of
rejecting
happiness
as
absolutely
valueless
for
we
have
a
practical
need
of
determining
not
only
whether
we
should
pursue
truth
rather
than
beauty
or
freedom
or
some
ideal
constitution
of
society
rather
than
either
or
perhaps
desert
all
of
these
for
the
life
of
worship
and
religious
contemplation
but
also
how
far
we
should
follow
any
of
these
lines
of
endeavour
when
we
foresee
among
its
consequences
the
pains
of
human
or
other
sentient
beings
or
even
the
loss
of
pleasures
that
might
otherwise
have
been
enjoyed
by
them
i
have
failed
to
find
and
am
unable
to
construct
any
systematic
answer
to
this
question
that
appears
to
me
deserving
of
serious
consideration
and
hence
i
am
finally
led
to
the
conclusion
which
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
seemed
to
be
premature
that
the
intuitional
method
rigorously
applied
yields
as
its
final
result
the
doctrine
of
pure
universalistic
hedonism
which
it
is
convenient
to
denote
by
the
single
word
utilitarianism

final
that
is
so
far
as
the
quality
of
the
present

is
concerned
i
have
pointed
out
that
so
far
as
any
estimate
of
the
desirability
or
pleasantness
of
a
feeling
involves
comparison
with
feelings
only
represented
in
idea
it
is
liable
to
be
erroneous
through
imperfections
in
the
representation
the
term
cognition
without
qualification
more
often
implies
what
is
signified
by
true
or
valid
but
for
the
present
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
eliminate
this
implication
cf

i
ought
at
the
same
time
to
say
that
i
hold
it
no

reasonable
for
an
individual
to
take
his
own
happiness
as
his
ultimate
end
this
dualism
of
the
practical
reason
will
be
further
discussed
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
treatise
we
may
illustrate
this
double
explanation
by
a
reference
to
some
of
plato
s
dialogues
such
as
the
where
the
ethical
argument
has
a
singularly
mixed
effect
on
the
mind
partly
it
seems
to
us
more
or
less
dexterous
sophistry
playing
on
a
confusion
of
thought
latent
in
the
common
notion
of
good
partly
a
noble
and
stirring
expression
of
a
profound
moral
faith
cf
stewart
of
the
active
and
moral
book
ii
chap
i
the
controversy
on
vivisection
to
which
i
referred
just
now
affords
a
good
illustration
of
the
need
that
i
am
pointing
out
i
do
not
observe
that
any
one
in
this
controversy
has
ventured
on
the
paradox
that
the
pain
of
sentient
beings
is
not
to
be
avoided
i
have
before
noticed
book
ii
chap
iii
the
metaphysical
objection
taken
by
certain
writers
to
the
view
that
happiness
is
ultimate
good
on
the
ground
that
happiness
sum
of
pleasures
can
only
be
realised
in
successive
parts
whereas
a
chief
good
must
be
something
of
which
some
being
can
be
conceived
in
possession
something
that
is
which
he
can
have
all
at
once
on
considering
this
objection
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
so
far
as
it
is
even
plausible
its
plausibility
depends
on
the
exact
form
of
the
notion
a
chief
good
or
summum
bonum
which
is
perhaps
inappropriate
as
applied
to
happiness
i
have
therefore
in
this
chapter
used
the
notion
of
ultimate
good
as
i
can
see
no
shadow
of
reason
for
affirming
that
that
which
is
good
or
desirable
and
not
as
a
means
to
some
further
end
must
be
capable
of
being
possessed
all
at
once
i
can
understand
that
a
man
may
aspire
after
a
good
of
this
latter
kind
but
so
long
as
time
is
a
necessary
form
of
human
existence
it
can
hardly
be
surprising
that
human
good
should
be
subject
to
the
condition
of
being
realised
in
successive
parts
book
iv
utilitarianism
chapter
i
the
meaning
of
utilitarianism
the
term
utilitarianism
is
at
the
present
day
in
common
use
and
is
supposed
to
designate
a
doctrine
or
method
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
but
on
closer
examination
it
appears
to
be
applied
to
several
distinct
theories
having
no
necessary
connexion
with
one
another
and
not
even
referring
to
the
same
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
define
as
carefully
as
possible
the
doctrine
that
is
to
be
denoted
by
the
term
in
the
present
book
at
the
same
time
distinguishing
this
from
other
doctrines
to
which
usage
would
allow
the
name
to
be
applied
and
indicating
so
far
as
seems
necessary
its
relation
to
these
by
utilitarianism
is
here
meant
the
ethical
theory
that
the
conduct
which
under
any
given
circumstances
is
objectively
right
is
that
which
will
produce
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
on
the
whole
that
is
taking
into
account
all
whose
happiness
is
affected
by
the
conduct
it
would
tend
to
clearness
if
we
might
call
this
principle
and
the
method
based
upon
it
by
some
such
name
as
universalistic
hedonism
and
i
have
therefore
sometimes
ventured
to
use
this
term
in
spite
of
its
cumbrousness
the
first
doctrine
from
which
it
seems
necessary
to
distinguish
this
is
the
egoistic
hedonism
expounded
and
discussed
in
book
ii
of
this
treatise
the
difference
however
between
the
propositions
that
each
ought
to
seek
his
own
happiness
and
that
each
ought
to
seek
the
happiness
of
all
is
so
obvious
and
glaring
that
instead
of
dwelling
upon
it
we
seem
rather
called
upon
to
explain
how
the
two
ever
came
to
be
confounded
or
in
any
way
included
under
one
notion
this
question
and
the
general
relation
between
the
two
doctrines
were
briefly
discussed
in
a
former
chapter
among
other
points
it
was
there
noticed
that
the
confusion
between
these
two
ethical
theories
was
partly
assisted
by
the
confusion
with
both
of
the
psychological
theory
that
in
voluntary
actions
every
agent
does
universally
or
normally
seek
his
own
individual
happiness
or
pleasure
now
there
seems
to
be
no
connexion
between
this
latter
proposition
and
any
ethical
theory
but
in
so
far
as
there
is
a
natural
tendency
to
pass
from
psychological
to
ethical
hedonism
the
transition
must
be
at
least
primarily
to
the
egoistic
phase
of
the
latter
for
clearly
from
the
fact
that
every
one
actually
does
seek
his
own
happiness
we
can
not
conclude
as
an
immediate
and
obvious
inference
that
he
ought
to
seek
the
happiness
of
other
people
nor
again
is
utilitarianism
as
an
ethical
doctrine
necessarily
connected
with
the
psychological
theory
that
the
moral
sentiments
are
derived
by
association
of
ideas
or
otherwise
from
experiences
of
the
pleasures
and
pains
resulting
to
the
agent
or
to
others
from
different
kinds
of
conduct
an
intuitionist
might
accept
this
theory
so
far
as
it
is
capable
of
scientific
proof
and
still
hold
that
these
moral
sentiments
being
found
in
our
present
consciousness
as
independent
impulses
ought
to
possess
the
authority
that
they
seem
to
claim
over
the
more
primary
desires
and
aversions
from
which
they
have
sprung
and
an
egoist
on
the
other
hand
might
fully
admit
the
altruistic
element
of
the
derivation
and
still
hold
that
these
and
all
other
impulses
including
even
universal
benevolence
are
properly
under
the
rule
of
rational
and
that
it
is
really
only
reasonable
to
gratify
them
in
so
far
as
we
may
expect
to
find
our
private
happiness
in
such
gratification
in
short
what
is
often
called
the
utilitarian
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
moral
sentiments
can
not
by
itself
provide
a
proof
of
the
ethical
doctrine
to
which
i
in
this
treatise
restrict
the
term
utilitarianism
i
shall
however
hereafter
try
to
show
that
this
psychological
theory
has
an
important
though
subordinate
place
in
the
establishment
of
ethical
utilitarianism
finally
the
doctrine
that
universal
happiness
is
the
ultimate
must
not
be
understood
to
imply
that
universal
benevolence
is
the
only
right
or
always
best
of
action
for
as
we
have
before
observed
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
end
which
gives
the
criterion
of
rightness
should
always
be
the
end
at
which
we
consciously
aim
and
if
experience
shows
that
the
general
happiness
will
be
more
satisfactorily
attained
if
men
frequently
act
from
other
motives
than
pure
universal
philanthropy
it
is
obvious
that
these
other
motives
are
reasonably
to
be
preferred
on
utilitarian
principles
let
us
now
examine
the
principle
itself
somewhat
closer
i
have
already
attempted
book
ii
chap
i
to
render
the
notion
of
greatest
happiness
as
clear
and
definite
as
possible
and
the
results
there
obtained
are
of
course
as
applicable
to
the
discussion
of
universalistic
as
to
that
of
egoistic
hedonism
we
shall
understand
then
that
by
greatest
happiness
is
meant
the
greatest
possible
surplus
of
pleasure
over
pain
the
pain
being
conceived
as
balanced
against
an
equal
amount
of
pleasure
so
that
the
two
contrasted
amounts
annihilate
each
other
for
purposes
of
ethical
calculation
and
of
course
here
as
before
the
assumption
is
involved
that
all
pleasures
included
in
our
calculation
are
capable
of
being
compared
quantitatively
with
one
another
and
with
all
pains
that
every
such
feeling
has
a
certain
intensive
quantity
positive
or
negative
or
perhaps
zero
in
respect
of
its
desirableness
and
that
this
quantity
may
be
to
some
extent
known
so
that
each
may
be
at
least
roughly
weighed
in
ideal
scales
against
any
other
this
assumption
is
involved
in
the
very
notion
of
maximum
happiness
as
the
attempt
to
make
as
great
as
possible
a
sum
of
elements
not
quantitatively
commensurable
would
be
a
mathematical
absurdity
therefore
whatever
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
the
objections
brought
against
this
assumption
which
was
discussed
in
chap
iii
of
book
ii
must
of
course
tell
against
the
present
method
we
have
next
to
consider
who
the
all
are
whose
happiness
is
to
be
taken
into
account
are
we
to
extend
our
concern
to
all
the
beings
capable
of
pleasure
and
pain
whose
feelings
are
affected
by
our
conduct
or
are
we
to
confine
our
view
to
human
happiness
the
former
view
is
the
one
adopted
by
bentham
and
mill
and
i
believe
by
the
utilitarian
school
generally
and
is
obviously
most
in
accordance
with
the
universality
that
is
characteristic
of
their
principle
it
is
the
good
interpreted
and
defined
as
happiness
or
pleasure
at
which
a
utilitarian
considers
it
his
duty
to
aim
and
it
seems
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
to
exclude
from
the
end
as
so
conceived
any
pleasure
of
any
sentient
being
it
may
be
said
that
by
giving
this
extension
to
the
notion
we
considerably
increase
the
scientific
difficulties
of
the
hedonistic
comparison
which
have
already
been
pointed
out
book
ii
chap
iii
for
if
it
be
difficult
to
compare
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
other
men
accurately
with
our
own
a
comparison
of
either
with
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
brutes
is
obviously
still
more
obscure
still
the
difficulty
is
at
least
not
greater
for
utilitarians
than
it
is
for
any
other
moralists
who
recoil
from
the
paradox
of
disregarding
altogether
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
brutes
but
even
if
we
limit
our
attention
to
human
beings
the
extent
of
the
subjects
of
happiness
is
not
yet
quite
determinate
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
asked
how
far
we
are
to
consider
the
interests
of
posterity
when
they
seem
to
conflict
with
those
of
existing
human
beings
it
seems
however
clear
that
the
time
at
which
a
man
exists
can
not
affect
the
value
of
his
happiness
from
a
universal
point
of
view
and
that
the
interests
of
posterity
must
concern
a
utilitarian
as
much
as
those
of
his
contemporaries
except
in
so
far
as
the
effect
of
his
actions
on
posterity
and
even
the
existence
of
human
beings
to
be
affected
must
necessarily
be
more
uncertain
but
a
further
question
arises
when
we
consider
that
we
can
to
some
extent
influence
the
number
of
future
human
or
sentient
beings
we
have
to
ask
how
on
utilitarian
principles
this
influence
is
to
be
exercised
here
i
shall
assume
that
for
human
beings
generally
life
on
the
average
yields
a
positive
balance
of
pleasure
over
pain
this
has
been
denied
by
thoughtful
persons
but
the
denial
seems
to
me
clearly
opposed
to
the
common
experience
of
mankind
as
expressed
in
their
commonly
accepted
principles
of
action
the
great
majority
of
men
in
the
great
majority
of
conditions
under
which
human
life
is
lived
certainly
act
as
if
death
were
one
of
the
worst
of
evils
for
themselves
and
for
those
whom
they
love
and
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
proceeds
on
a
similar
assumption
assuming
then
that
the
average
happiness
of
human
beings
is
a
positive
quantity
it
seems
clear
that
supposing
the
average
happiness
enjoyed
remains
undiminished
utilitarianism
directs
us
to
make
the
number
enjoying
it
as
great
as
possible
but
if
we
foresee
as
possible
that
an
increase
in
numbers
will
be
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
average
happiness
or
a
point
arises
which
has
not
only
never
been
formally
noticed
but
which
seems
to
have
been
substantially
overlooked
by
many
utilitarians
for
if
we
take
utilitarianism
to
prescribe
as
the
ultimate
end
of
action
happiness
on
the
whole
and
not
any
individual
s
happiness
unless
considered
as
an
element
of
the
whole
it
would
follow
that
if
the
additional
population
enjoy
on
the
whole
positive
happiness
we
ought
to
weigh
the
amount
of
happiness
gained
by
the
extra
number
against
the
amount
lost
by
the
remainder
so
that
strictly
conceived
the
point
up
to
which
on
utilitarian
principles
population
ought
to
be
encouraged
to
increase
is
not
that
at
which
average
happiness
is
the
greatest
possible
as
appears
to
be
often
assumed
by
political
economists
of
the
school
of
malthus
but
that
at
which
the
product
formed
by
multiplying
the
number
of
persons
living
into
the
amount
of
average
happiness
reaches
its
maximum
it
may
be
well
here
to
make
a
remark
which
has
a
wide
application
in
utilitarian
discussion
the
conclusion
just
given
wears
a
certain
air
of
absurdity
to
the
view
of
common
sense
because
its
show
of
exactness
is
grotesquely
incongruous
with
our
consciousness
of
the
inevitable
inexactness
of
all
such
calculations
in
actual
practice
but
that
our
practical
utilitarian
reasonings
must
necessarily
be
rough
is
no
reason
for
not
making
them
as
accurate
as
the
case
admits
and
we
shall
be
more
likely
to
succeed
in
this
if
we
keep
before
our
mind
as
distinctly
as
possible
the
strict
type
of
the
calculation
that
we
should
have
to
make
if
all
the
relevant
considerations
could
be
estimated
with
mathematical
precision
there
is
one
more
point
that
remains
to
be
noticed
it
is
evident
that
there
may
be
many
different
ways
of
distributing
the
same
quantum
of
happiness
among
the
same
number
of
persons
in
order
therefore
that
the
utilitarian
criterion
of
right
conduct
may
be
as
complete
as
possible
we
ought
to
know
which
of
these
ways
is
to
be
preferred
this
question
is
often
ignored
in
expositions
of
utilitarianism
it
has
perhaps
seemed
somewhat
idle
as
suggesting
a
purely
abstract
and
theoretical
perplexity
that
could
have
no
practical
exemplification
and
no
doubt
if
all
the
consequences
of
actions
were
capable
of
being
estimated
and
summed
up
with
mathematical
precision
we
should
probably
never
find
the
excess
of
pleasure
over
pain
exactly
equal
in
the
case
of
two
competing
alternatives
of
conduct
but
the
very
indefiniteness
of
all
hedonistic
calculations
which
was
sufficiently
shown
in
book
renders
it
by
no
means
unlikely
that
there
may
be
no
difference
between
the
quantities
of
happiness
involved
in
two
sets
of
consequences
respectively
the
more
rough
our
estimates
necessarily
are
the
less
likely
we
shall
be
to
come
to
any
clear
decision
between
two
apparently
balanced
alternatives
in
all
such
cases
therefore
it
becomes
practically
important
to
ask
whether
any
mode
of
distributing
a
given
quantum
of
happiness
is
better
than
any
other
now
the
utilitarian
formula
seems
to
supply
no
answer
to
this
question
at
least
we
have
to
supplement
the
principle
of
seeking
the
greatest
happiness
on
the
whole
by
some
principle
of
just
or
right
distribution
of
this
happiness
the
principle
which
most
utilitarians
have
either
tacitly
or
expressly
adopted
is
that
of
pure
equality
as
given
in
bentham
s
formula
everybody
to
count
for
one
and
nobody
for
more
than
and
this
principle
seems
the
only
one
which
does
not
need
a
special
justification
for
as
we
saw
it
must
be
reasonable
to
treat
any
one
man
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
if
there
be
no
reason
apparent
for
treating
him
differently

so

as

plausibility

to
me
to
be
obtained
by
dwelling
onesidedly
on
the
annoyances
and
disappointments
undoubtedly
incident
to
normal
human
life
and
on
the
exceptional

of

perhaps
of
most
men
during

portions
of
their
lives
the
reader
who
wishes
to
see
the
paradoxical
results
of
pessimistic
utilitarianism
seriously
worked
out
by
a
thoughtful
and
suggestive
writer
may
refer
to
professor
macmillan
s
book
on
the
of
general
swan
sonnenschein
and
the
author
considers
that
the
philosophical
world
is
pretty
equally
divided
between
optimists
and
pessimists
and
his
own
judgment
on
the
question
at
issue
between
the
two
schools
appears
to
be
held
in
suspense
it
should
be
observed
that
the
question
here
is
as
to
the
distribution
of
not
the
of
if
more
happiness
on
the
whole
is
produced
by
giving
the
same
means
of
happiness
to
b
rather
than
to
a
it
is
an
obvious
and
incontrovertible
deduction
from
the
utilitarian
principle
that
it
ought
to
be
given
to
b
whatever
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
the
of
happiness
this
may
involve
chapter
ii
the
proof
of
utilitarianism
in
book
where
we
discussed
the
method
of
egoistic
hedonism
we
did
not
take
occasion
to
examine
any
proof
of
its
first
principle
and
in
the
case
of
universalistic
hedonism
also
what
primarily
concerns
us
is
not
how
its
principle
is
to
be
proved
to
those
who
do
not
accept
it
but
what
consequences
are
logically
involved
in
its
acceptance
at
the
same
time
it
is
important
to
observe
that
the
principle
of
aiming
at
universal
happiness
is
more
generally
felt
to
require
some
proof
or
at
least
as
mill
puts
it
some
considerations
determining
the
mind
to
accept
it
than
the
principle
of
aiming
at
one
s
own
happiness
from
the
point
of
view
indeed
of
abstract
philosophy
i
do
not
see
why
the
egoistic
principle
should
pass
unchallenged
any
more
than
the
universalistic
i
do
not
see
why
the
axiom
of
prudence
should
not
be
questioned
when
it
conflicts
with
present
inclination
on
a
ground
similar
to
that
on
which
egoists
refuse
to
admit
the
axiom
of
rational
benevolence
if
the
utilitarian
has
to
answer
the
question
why
should
i
sacrifice
my
own
happiness
for
the
greater
happiness
of
another
it
must
surely
be
admissible
to
ask
the
egoist
why
should
i
sacrifice
a
present
pleasure
for
a
greater
one
in
the
future
why
should
i
concern
myself
about
my
own
future
feelings
any
more
than
about
the
feelings
of
other
persons
it
undoubtedly
seems
to
common
sense
paradoxical
to
ask
for
a
reason
why
one
should
seek
one
s
own
happiness
on
the
whole
but
i
do
not
see
how
the
demand
can
be
repudiated
as
absurd
by
those
who
adopt
the
views
of
the
extreme
empirical
school
of
psychologists
although
those
views
are
commonly
supposed
to
have
a
close
affinity
with
egoistic
hedonism
grant
that
the
ego
is
merely
a
system
of
coherent
phenomena
that
the
permanent
identical
i
is
not
a
fact
but
a
fiction
as
hume
and
his
followers
maintain
why
then
should
one
part
of
the
series
of
feelings
into
which
the
ego
is
resolved
be
concerned
with
another
part
of
the
same
series
any
more
than
with
any
other
series
however
i
will
not
press
this
question
now
since
i
admit
that
common
sense
does
not
think
it
worth
while
to
supply
the
individual
with
reasons
for
seeking
his
own
interest
reasons
for
doing
his
duty
according
to
the
commonly
accepted
standard
of
duty
are
not
held
to
be
equally
superfluous
indeed
we
find
that
utilitarian
reasons
are
continually
given
for
one
or
other
of
the
commonly
received
rules
of
morality
still
the
fact
that
certain
rules
are
commonly
received
as
binding
though
it
does
not
establish
their
renders
it
generally
unnecessary
to
prove
their
authority
to
the
common
sense
that
receives
them
while
for
the
same
reason
a
utilitarian
who
claims
to
supersede
them
by
a
higher
principle
is
naturally
challenged
by
intuitionists
no
less
than
by
egoists
to
demonstrate
the
legitimacy
of
his
claim
to
this
challenge
some
utilitarians
would
reply
by
saying
that
it
is
impossible
to
prove
a
first
principle
and
this
is
of
course
true
if
by
proof
we
mean
a
process
which
exhibits
the
principle
in
question
as
an
inference
from
premises
upon
which
it
remains
dependent
for
its
certainty
for
these
premises
and
not
the
inference
drawn
from
them
would
then
be
the
real
first
principles
nay
if
utilitarianism
is
to
be
to
a
man
who
already
holds
some
other
moral
principles
whether
he
be
an
intuitional
moralist
who
regards
as
final
the
principles
of
truth
justice
obedience
to
authority
purity
or
an
egoist
who
regards
his
own
interest
as
the
ultimately
reasonable
end
of
his
conduct
it
would
seem
that
the
process
must
be
one
which
establishes
a
conclusion
actually
in
validity
to
the
premises
from
which
it
starts
for
the
utilitarian
prescriptions
of
duty
are
in
conflict
at
certain
points
and
under
certain
circumstances
both
with
rules
which
the
intuitionist
regards
as
and
with
the
dictates
of
rational
egoism
so
that
utilitarianism
if
accepted
at
all
must
be
accepted
as
overruling
intuitionism
and
egoism
at
the
same
time
if
the
other
principles
are
not
throughout
taken
as
valid
the
proof
does
not
seem
to
be
addressed
to
the
intuitionist
or
egoist
at
all
how
shall
we
deal
with
this
dilemma
how
is
such
a
process
clearly
different
from
ordinary
proof
possible
or
conceivable
yet
there
certainly
seems
to
be
a
general
demand
for
it
perhaps
we
may
say
that
what
is
needed
is
a
line
of
argument
which
on
the
one
hand
allows
the
validity
to
a
certain
extent
of
the
maxims
already
accepted
and
on
the
other
hand
shows
them
to
be
not
absolutely
valid
but
needing
to
be
controlled
and
completed
by
some
more
comprehensive
principle
such
a
line
of
argument
addressed
to
egoism
was
given
in
chap
xiii
of
the
foregoing
book
it
should
be
observed
that
the
applicability
of
this
argument
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
the
egoistic
first
principle
is
formulated
if
the
egoist
strictly
confines
himself
to
stating
his
conviction
that
he
ought
to
take
his
own
happiness
or
pleasure
as
his
ultimate
end
there
seems
no
opening
for
any
line
of
reasoning
to
lead
him
to
universalistic
hedonism
as
a
first
principle
it
can
not
be
proved
that
the
difference
between
his
own
happiness
and
another
s
happiness
is
not
in
this
case
all
that
the
utilitarian
can
do
is
to
effect
as
far
as
possible
a
reconciliation
between
the
two
principles
by
expounding
to
the
egoist
the
of
rules
deduced
from
the
universalistic
principle
by
pointing
out
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
may
be
expected
to
accrue
to
the
egoist
himself
from
the
observation
and
violation
respectively
of
such
rules
it
is
obvious
that
such
an
exposition
has
no
tendency
to
make
him
accept
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
as
his
ultimate
end
but
only
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
his
own
happiness
it
is
therefore
totally
different
from
a
as
above
explained
of
universalistic
hedonism
when
however
the
egoist
puts
forward
implicitly
or
explicitly
the
proposition
that
his
happiness
or
pleasure
is
good
not
only
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
universe
as
by
saying
that
nature
designed
him
to
seek
his
own
happiness
it
then
becomes
relevant
to
point
out
to
him
that
happiness
can
not
be
a
more
important
part
of
good
taken
universally
than
the
equal
happiness
of
any
other
person
and
thus
starting
with
his
own
principle
he
may
be
brought
to
accept
universal
happiness
or
pleasure
as
that
which
is
absolutely
and
without
qualification
good
or
desirable
as
an
end
therefore
to
which
the
action
of
a
reasonable
agent
as
such
ought
to
be
directed
this
it
will
be
remembered
is
the
reasoning
that
i
used
in
chap
xiii
of
the
preceding
book
in
exhibiting
the
principle
of
rational
benevolence
as
one
of
the
few
intuitions
which
stand
the
test
of
rigorous
criticism
it
should
be
observed
however
that
as
addressed
to
the
intuitionist
this
reasoning
only
shows
the
utilitarian
first
principle
to
be
moral
axiom
it
does
not
prove
that
it
is
or
the
premises
with
which
the
intuitionist
starts
commonly
include
other
formulæ
held
as
independent
and
utilitarianism
has
therefore
to
exhibit
itself
in
the
twofold
relation
above
described
at
once
negative
and
positive
to
these
formulæ
the
utilitarian
must
in
the
first
place
endeavour
to
show
to
the
intuitionist
that
the
principles
of
truth
justice
etc
have
only
a
dependent
and
subordinate
validity
arguing
either
that
the
principle
is
really
only
affirmed
by
common
sense
as
a
general
rule
admitting
of
exceptions
and
qualifications
as
in
the
case
of
truth
and
that
we
require
some
further
principle
for
systematising
these
exceptions
and
qualifications
or
that
the
fundamental
notion
is
vague
and
needs
further
determination
as
in
the
case
of
justice
and
further
that
the
different
rules
are
liable
to
conflict
with
each
other
and
that
we
require
some
higher
principle
to
decide
the
issue
thus
raised
and
again
that
the
rules
are
differently
formulated
by
different
persons
and
that
these
differences
admit
of
no
intuitional
solution
while
they
show
the
vagueness
and
ambiguity
of
the
common
moral
notions
to
which
the
intuitionist
appeals
this
part
of
the
argument
i
have
perhaps
sufficiently
developed
in
the
preceding
book
it
remains
to
supplement
this
line
of
reasoning
by
developing
the
positive
relation
that
exists
between
utilitarianism
and
the
morality
of
common
sense
by
showing
how
utilitarianism
sustains
the
general
validity
of
the
current
moral
judgments
and
thus
supplements
the
defects
which
reflection
finds
in
the
intuitive
recognition
of
their
stringency
and
at
the
same
time
affords
a
principle
of
synthesis
and
a
method
for
binding
the
unconnected
and
occasionally
conflicting
principles
of
common
moral
reasoning
into
a
complete
and
harmonious
system
if
systematic
reflection
upon
the
morality
of
common
sense
thus
exhibits
the
utilitarian
principle
as
that
to
which
common
sense
naturally
appeals
for
that
further
development
of
its
system
which
this
same
reflection
shows
to
be
necessary
the
proof
of
utilitarianism
seems
as
complete
as
it
can
be
made
and
since
further
apart
from
the
question
of
proof
it
is
important
in
considering
the
method
of
utilitarianism
to
determine
exactly
its
relation
to
the
commonly
received
rules
of
morality
it
will
be
proper
to
examine
this
relation
at
some
length
in
the
following
chapter
footnotes
the
relation
of
egoistic
to
universalistic
hedonism
is
further
examined
in
the
concluding
chapter
it
is
to
be
observed
that
he
may
be
led
to
it
in
other
ways
than
that
of
argument
by
appeals
to
his
sympathies
or
to
his
moral
or
sentiments
i
ought
to
remind
the
reader
that
the
argument
in
chap
xiii
only
leads
to
the
first
principle
of
utilitarianism
if
it
be
admitted
that
happiness
is
the
only
thing
ultimately
and
intrinsically
good
or
desirable
i
afterwards
in
chap
xiv
endeavoured
to
bring
common
sense
to
this
admission
that
is
so
far
as
we
mean
by
justice
anything
more
than
the
simple
negation
of
arbitrary
inequality

relation
of
utilitarianism
to
the
morality
of
common
sense
it
has
been
before
observed
book
chap
vi
that
the
two
sides
of
the
double
relation
in
which
utilitarianism
stands
to
the
morality
of
common
sense
have
been
respectively
prominent
at
two
different
periods
in
the
history
of
english
ethical
thought
since
bentham
we
have
been
chiefly
familiar
with
the
negative
or
aggressive
aspect
of
the
utilitarian
doctrine
but
when
cumberland
replying
to
hobbes
put
forward
the
general
tendency
of
the
received
moral
rules
to
promote
the
common
good
of
all
rationals
his
aim
was
simply
conservative
it
never
occurs
to
him
to
consider
whether
these
rules
as
commonly
formulated
are
in
any
way
imperfect
and
whether
there
are
any
discrepancies
between
such
common
moral
opinions
and
the
conclusions
of
rational
benevolence
so
in
shaftesbury
s
system
the
moral
or
reflex
sense
is
supposed
to
be
always
pleased
with
that
balance
of
the
affections
which
tends
to
the
good
or
happiness
of
the
whole
and
displeased
with
the
opposite
in
hume
s
treatise
this
coincidence
is
drawn
out
more
in
detail
and
with
a
more
definite
assertion
that
the
perception
of
utility
or
the
reverse
is
in
each
case
the
source
of
the
moral
likings
or
aversions
which
are
excited
in
us
by
different
qualities
of
human
character
and
conduct
and
we
may
observe
that
the
most
penetrating
among
hume
s
contemporary
critics
adam
smith
admits
unreservedly
the
objective
coincidence
of
rightness
or
approvedness
and
utility
though
he
maintains
in
opposition
to
hume
that
it
is
not
the
view
of
this
utility
or
hurtfulness
which
is
either
the
first
or
the
principal
source
of
our
approbation
or
after
stating
hume
s
theory
that
no
qualities
of
the
mind
are
approved
of
as
virtuous
but
such
as
are
useful
or
agreeable
either
to
the
person
himself
or
to
others
and
no
qualities
are
disapproved
of
as
vicious
but
such
as
have
a
contrary
tendency
he
remarks
that
nature
seems
indeed
to
have
so
happily
adjusted
our
sentiments
of
approbation
and
disapprobation
to
the
conveniency
both
of
the
individual
and
of
the
society
that
after
the
strictest
examination
it
will
be
found
i
believe
that
this
is
universally
the
and
no
one
can
read
hume
s
into
the
first
principles
of
without
being
convinced
of
this
at
least
that
if
a
list
were
drawn
up
of
the
qualities
of
character
and
conduct
that
are
directly
or
indirectly
productive
of
pleasure
to
ourselves
or
to
others
it
would
include
all
that
are
commonly
known
as
virtues
whatever
be
the
origin
of
our
notion
of
moral
goodness
or
excellence
there
is
no
doubt
that
utility
is
a
general
characteristic
of
the
dispositions
to
which
we
apply
it
and
that
so
far
the
morality
of
common
sense
may
be
truly
represented
as
at
least
unconsciously
utilitarian
but
it
may
still
be
objected
that
this
coincidence
is
merely
general
and
qualitative
and
that
it
breaks
down
when
we
attempt
to
draw
it
out
in
detail
with
the
quantitative
precision
which
bentham
introduced
into
the
discussion
and
no
doubt
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
assertion
that
virtue
is
always
productive
of
happiness
and
the
assertion
that
the
right
action
is
under
all
circumstances
that
which
will
produce
the
greatest
possible
happiness
on
the
whole
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
utilitarianism
is
not
concerned
to
prove
the
absolute
coincidence
in
results
of
the
intuitional
and
utilitarian
methods
indeed
if
it
could
succeed
in
proving
as
much
as
this
its
success
would
be
almost
fatal
to
its
practical
claims
as
the
adoption
of
the
utilitarian
principle
would
then
become
a
matter
of
complete
indifference
utilitarians
are
rather
called
upon
to
show
a
natural
transition
from
the
morality
of
common
sense
to
utilitarianism
somewhat
like
the
transition
in
special
branches
of
practice
from
trained
instinct
and
empirical
rules
to
the
technical
method
that
embodies
and
applies
the
conclusions
of
science
so
that
utilitarianism
may
be
presented
as
the
scientifically
complete
and
systematically
reflective
form
of
that
regulation
of
conduct
which
through
the
whole
course
of
human
history
has
always
tended
substantially
in
the
same
direction
for
this
purpose
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
that
existing
moral
rules
are
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
than
any
others
but
only
to
point
out
in
each
case
some
manifest
felicific
tendency
which
they
possess
hume
s
dissertation
however
incidentally
exhibits
much
more
than
a
simple
and
general
harmony
between
the
moral
sentiments
with
which
we
commonly
regard
actions
and
their
foreseen
pleasurable
and
painful
consequences
and
in
fact
the
utilitarian
argument
can
not
be
fairly
judged
unless
we
take
fully
into
account
the
cumulative
force
which
it
derives
from
the
complex
character
of
the
coincidence
between
utilitarianism
and
common
sense
it
may
be
shown
i
think
that
the
utilitarian
estimate
of
consequences
not
only
supports
broadly
the
current
moral
rules
but
also
sustains
their
generally
received
limitations
and
qualifications
that
again
it
explains
anomalies
in
the
morality
of
common
sense
which
from
any
other
point
of
view
must
seem
unsatisfactory
to
the
reflective
intellect
and
moreover
where
the
current
formula
is
not
sufficiently
precise
for
the
guidance
of
conduct
while
at
the
same
time
difficulties
and
perplexities
arise
in
the
attempt
to
give
it
additional
precision
the
utilitarian
method
solves
these
difficulties
and
perplexities
in
general
accordance
with
the
vague
instincts
of
common
sense
and
is
naturally
appealed
to
for
such
solution
in
ordinary
moral
discussions
it
may
be
shown
further
that
it
not
only
supports
the
generally
received
view
of
the
relative
importance
of
different
duties
but
is
also
naturally
called
in
as
arbiter
where
rules
commonly
regarded
as
come
into
conflict
that
again
when
the
same
rule
is
interpreted
somewhat
differently
by
different
persons
each
naturally
supports
his
view
by
urging
its
utility
however
strongly
he
may
maintain
the
rule
to
be
and
known
that
where
we
meet
with
marked
diversity
of
moral
opinion
on
any
point
in
the
same
age
and
country
we
commonly
find
manifest
and
impressive
utilitarian
reasons
on
both
sides
and
that
finally
the
remarkable
discrepancies
found
in
comparing
the
moral
codes
of
different
ages
and
countries
are
for
the
most
part
strikingly
correlated
to
differences
in
the
effects
of
actions
on
happiness
or
in
men
s
foresight
of
or
concern
for
such
effects
most
of
these
points
are
noticed
by
hume
though
in
a
somewhat
casual
and
fragmentary
way
and
many
of
them
have
been
incidentally
illustrated
in
the
course
of
the
examination
of
common
sense
morality
with
which
we
were
occupied
in
the
preceding
book
but
considering
the
importance
of
the
present
question
it
may
be
well
to
exhibit
in
systematic
detail
the
cumulative
argument
which
has
just
been
summed
up
even
at
the
risk
of
repeating
to
some
extent
the
results
previously
given
we
may
begin
by
replying
to
an
objection
which
is
frequently
urged
against
utilitarianism
how
it
is
asked
if
the
true
ground
of
the
moral
goodness
or
badness
of
actions
lies
in
their
utility
or
the
reverse
can
we
explain
the
broad
distinction
drawn
by
common
sense
between
the
moral
and
other
parts
of
our
nature
why
is
the
excellence
of
virtue
so
strongly
felt
to
be
different
in
kind
not
merely
from
the
excellence
of
a
machine
or
a
fertile
field
but
also
from
the
physical
beauties
and
aptitudes
the
intellectual
gifts
and
talents
of
human
beings
i
should
answer
that
as
was
argued
in
an
earlier
chapter
book
iii
chap
ii
qualities
that
are
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
virtuous
are
always
such
as
we
conceive
capable
of
being
immediately
realised
by
voluntary
effort
at
least
to
some
extent
so
that
the
prominent
obstacle
to
virtuous
action
is
absence
of
adequate
motive
hence
we
expect
that
the
judgments
of
moral
goodness
or
badness
passed
either
by
the
agent
himself
or
by
others
will
by
the
fresh
motive
which
they
supply
on
the
side
of
virtue
have
an
immediate
practical
effect
in
causing
actions
to
be
at
least
externally
virtuous
and
the
habitual
consciousness
of
this
will
account
for
almost
any
degree
of
difference
between
moral
sentiments
and
the
pleasure
and
pain
that
we
derive
from
the
contemplation
of
either
or
utilities
and
inutilities
to
this
however
it
is
replied
that
among
the
tendencies
to
strictly
voluntary
actions
there
are
many
not
commonly
regarded
as
virtuous
which
are
yet
not
only
useful
but
on
the
whole
useful
than
many
virtues
the
selfish
instinct
that
leads
men
to
accumulate
confers
ultimately
more
advantage
on
the
world
than
the
generous
instinct
that
leads
men
to
give
it
is
scarcely
doubtful
that
a
modest
diffident
and
retiring
nature
distrustful
of
its
own
abilities
and
shrinking
with
humility
from
conflict
produces
on
the
whole
less
benefit
to
the
world
than
the
of
an
audacious
and
arrogant
nature
which
is
impelled
to
every
struggle
and
develops
every
capacity
gratitude
has
no
doubt
done
much
to
soften
and
sweeten
the
intercourse
of
life
but
the
corresponding
feeling
of
revenge
was
for
centuries
the
one
bulwark
against
social
anarchy
and
is
even
now
one
of
the
chief
restraints
to
crime
on
the
great
theatre
of
public
life
especially
in
periods
of
great
convulsions
where
passions
are
fiercely
roused
it
is
neither
the
man
of
delicate
scrupulosity
and
sincere
impartiality
nor
yet
the
religious
enthusiast
incapable
of
dissimulation
or
procrastination
who
confers
most
benefit
on
the
world
it
is
much
rather
the
astute
statesman
earnest
about
his
ends
but
unscrupulous
about
his
means
equally
free
from
the
trammels
of
conscience
and
from
the
blindness
of
zeal
who
governs
because
he
partly
yields
to
the
passions
and
the
prejudices
of
his
time
but
it
has
scarcely
yet
been
contended
that
the
delicate
conscience
which
in
these
cases
impairs
utility
constitutes
these
objections
are
forcibly
urged
but
they
appear
to
me
not
very
difficult
to
answer
it
being
always
borne
in
mind
that
the
present
argument
does
not
aim
at
proving
an
exact
coincidence
between
utilitarian
inferences
and
the
intuitions
of
common
sense
but
rather
seeks
to
represent
the
latter
as
inchoately
and
imperfectly
utilitarian
in
the
first
place
we
must
carefully
distinguish
between
the
recognition
of
goodness
in
dispositions
and
the
recognition
of
rightness
in
conduct
an
act
that
a
utilitarian
must
condemn
as
likely
to
do
more
harm
than
good
may
yet
show
a
disposition
or
tendency
that
will
on
the
whole
produce
more
good
than
harm
this
is
eminently
the
case
with
scrupulously
conscientious
acts
however
true
it
may
be
that
unenlightened
conscientiousness
has
impelled
men
to
fanatical
cruelty
mistaken
asceticism
and
other
infelicific
conduct
i
suppose
no
intuitionist
would
maintain
that
carefulness
in
conforming
to
accepted
moral
rules
has
not
on
the
whole
a
tendency
to
promote
happiness
it
may
be
observed
however
that
when
we
perceive
the
effects
of
a
disposition
generally
felicific
to
be
in
any
particular
case
adverse
to
happiness
we
often
apply
to
it
as
so
operating
some
term
of
condemnation
thus
we
speak
in
the
case
above
noticed
of
or
but
in
so
far
as
we
perceive
that
the
same
disposition
would
generally
produce
good
results
it
is
not
inconsistent
still
to
regard
it
abstracting
from
the
particular
case
as
a
good
element
of
character
secondly
although
in
the
view
of
a
utilitarian
only
the
useful
is
praiseworthy
he
is
not
bound
to
maintain
that
it
is
necessarily
worthy
of
praise
in
proportion
as
it
is
useful
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
as
has
been
before
said
we
must
mean
by
calling
a
quality
deserving
of
praise
that
it
is
expedient
to
praise
it
with
a
view
to
its
future
production
accordingly
in
distributing
our
praise
of
human
qualities
on
utilitarian
principles
we
have
to
consider
primarily
not
the
usefulness
of
the
quality
but
the
usefulness
of
the
praise
and
it
is
obviously
not
expedient
to
encourage
by
praise
qualities
which
are
likely
to
be
found
in
excess
rather
than
in
defect
hence
however
necessary
or
resentment
may
be
to
society
it
is
quite
in
harmony
with
utilitarianism
that
they
should
not
be
recognised
as
virtues
by
common
sense
in
so
far
as
it
is
reasonably
thought
that
they
will
always
be
found
operating
with
at
least
sufficient
intensity
we
find
however
that
when
comes
into
conflict
with
impulses
seen
to
be
on
the
whole
pernicious
it
is
praised
as
prudence
and
that
when
a
man
seems
clearly
deficient
in
resentment
he
is
censured
for
tameness
though
as
malevolent
impulses
are
much
more
obviously
productive
of
pain
than
pleasure
it
is
not
unnatural
that
their
occasional
utility
should
be
somewhat
overlooked
the
case
of
humility
and
diffidence
may
be
treated
in
a
somewhat
similar
way
as
we
saw
it
is
only
inadvertently
that
common
sense
praises
the
tendency
to
underrate
one
s
own
powers
on
reflection
it
is
generally
admitted
that
it
can
not
be
good
to
be
in
error
on
this
or
any
other
point
but
the
desires
of
superiority
and
esteem
are
so
strong
in
most
men
that
arrogance
and
are
both
much
commoner
than
the
opposite
defects
and
at
the
same
time
are
faults
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
others
so
that
humility
gives
us
an
agreeable
surprise
and
hence
common
sense
is
easily
led
to
overlook
the
more
latent
and
remote
bad
consequences
of
undue
we
may
observe
further
that
the
perplexity
which
we
seemed
to
find
in
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
to
the
relation
of
moral
excellence
to
moral
effort
is
satisfactorily
explained
and
removed
when
we
adopt
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
easy
to
see
how
certain
acts
such
as
kind
services
are
likely
to
be
more
felicific
when
performed
without
effort
and
from
other
motives
than
regard
for
duty
while
on
the
other
hand
a
person
who
in
doing
similar
acts
achieves
a
triumph
of
duty
over
strong
seductive
inclinations
exhibits
thereby
a
character
which
we
recognise
as
felicific
in
a
more
general
way
as
tending
to
a
general
performance
of
duty
in
all
departments
so
again
there
is
a
simple
and
obvious
utilitarian
solution
of
another
difficulty
which
i
noticed
as
to
the
choice
between
subjective
and
objective
rightness
in
the
exceptional
case
in
which
alone
the
two
can
be
presented
as
alternatives
when
we
are
considering
whether
we
shall
influence
another
to
act
contrary
to
his
conviction
as
to
what
is
right
a
utilitarian
would
decide
the
question
by
weighing
the
felicific
consequences
of
the
particular
right
act
against
the
infelicific
results
to
be
apprehended
hereafter
from
the
moral
deterioration
of
the
person
whose
conscientious
convictions
were
overborne
by
other
motives
unless
the
former
effects
were
very
important
he
would
reasonably
regard
the
danger
to
character
as
the
greater
but
if
the
other
s
mistaken
sense
of
duty
threatened
to
cause
a
grave
disaster
he
would
not
hesitate
to
overbear
it
by
any
motives
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
apply
and
in
practice
i
think
that
the
common
sense
of
mankind
would
come
to
similar
conclusions
by
more
vague
and
reasoning
of
the
same
kind
in
order
however
to
form
a
precise
estimate
of
the
extent
to
which
utilitarianism
agrees
or
disagrees
with
common
sense
it
seems
best
to
examine
the
more
definite
judgments
of
right
and
wrong
in
conduct
under
the
particular
heads
represented
by
our
common
notions
of
virtues
and
duties
i
may
begin
by
pointing
out
once
more
that
so
far
as
any
adequately
precise
definitions
of
these
notions
are
found
to
involve
implicitly
or
explicitly
the
notion
of
good
or
of
right
supposed
already
determinate
they
can
afford
no
ground
for
opposing
a
utilitarian
interpretation
of
these
fundamental
conceptions
for
example
we
saw
this
to
be
the
case
with
the
chief
of
the
intellectual
excellences
discussed
in
book
iii
chap
iii
wisdom
as
commonly
conceived
is
not
exactly
the
faculty
of
choosing
the
right
means
to
the
end
of
universal
happiness
rather
as
we
saw
its
notion
involves
an
uncritical
synthesis
of
the
different
ends
and
principles
that
are
distinguished
and
separately
examined
in
the
present
treatise
but
if
its
import
is
not
distinctly
utilitarian
it
is
certainly
not
anything
else
as
distinct
from
utilitarian
if
we
can
only
define
it
as
the
faculty
or
habit
of
choosing
the
right
or
best
means
to
the
right
or
best
end
for
that
very
reason
our
definition
leaves
it
quite
open
to
us
to
give
the
notions
good
and
right
a
utilitarian
import
let
us
then
examine
first
the
group
of
virtues
and
duties
discussed
in
book
iii
chap
under
the
head
of
benevolence
as
regards
the
general
conception
of
the
duty
there
is
i
think
no
divergence
that
we
need
consider
between
the
intuitional
and
utilitarian
systems
for
though
benevolence
would
perhaps
be
more
commonly
defined
as
a
disposition
to
promote
the
good
of
one
s
rather
than
their
happiness
as
definitely
understood
by
utilitarians
still
as
the
chief
element
in
the
common
notion
of
good
besides
happiness
is
moral
good
or
virtue
if
we
can
show
that
the
other
virtues
are
speaking
broadly
all
qualities
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
the
agent
himself
or
of
others
it
is
evident
that
benevolence
whether
it
prompts
us
to
promote
the
virtue
of
others
or
their
happiness
will
aim
directly
or
indirectly
at
the
utilitarian
end
nor
further
does
the
comprehensive
range
which
utilitarians
give
to
benevolence
in
stating
as
their
ultimate
end
the
greatest
happiness
of
all
sentient
beings
seem
to
be
really
opposed
to
common
sense
for
in
so
far
as
certain
intuitional
moralists
restrict
the
scope
of
the
direct
duty
of
benevolence
to
human
beings
and
regard
our
duties
to
brute
animals
as
merely
indirect
and
derived
from
the
duty
of
they
rather
than
their
utilitarian
opponents
appear
paradoxical
and
if
in
laying
down
that
each
agent
is
to
consider
all
other
happiness
as
equally
important
with
his
own
utilitarianism
seems
to
go
beyond
the
standard
of
duty
commonly
prescribed
under
the
head
of
benevolence
it
yet
can
scarcely
be
said
to
conflict
with
common
sense
on
this
point
for
the
practical
application
of
this
theoretical
impartiality
of
utilitarianism
is
limited
by
several
important
considerations
in
the
first
place
generally
speaking
each
man
is
better
able
to
provide
for
his
own
happiness
than
for
that
of
other
persons
from
his
more
intimate
knowledge
of
his
own
desires
and
needs
and
his
greater
opportunities
of
gratifying
them
and
besides
it
is
under
the
stimulus
of
that
the
active
energies
of
most
men
are
most
easily
and
thoroughly
drawn
out
and
if
this
were
removed
general
happiness
would
be
diminished
by
a
serious
loss
of
those
means
of
happiness
which
are
obtained
by
labour
and
also
to
some
extent
by
the
diminution
of
the
labour
itself
for
these
reasons
it
would
not
under
actual
circumstances
promote
the
universal
happiness
if
each
man
were
to
concern
himself
with
the
happiness
of
others
as
much
as
with
his
own
while
if
i
consider
the
duty
abstractly
and
ideally
even
common
sense
morality
seems
to
bid
me
love
my
neighbour
as
it
might
indeed
be
plausibly
objected
on
the
other
hand
that
under
the
notions
of
generosity
common
sense
praises
though
it
does
not
prescribe
as
obligatory
a
suppression
of
egoism
beyond
what
utilitarianism
approves
for
we
perhaps
admire
as
virtuous
a
man
who
gives
up
his
own
happiness
for
another
s
sake
even
when
the
happiness
that
he
confers
is
clearly
less
than
that
which
he
resigns
so
that
there
is
a
diminution
of
happiness
on
the
whole
but
it
seems
very
doubtful
whether
we
do
altogether
approve
such
conduct
when
the
disproportion
between
the
sacrifice
and
the
benefit
is
obvious
and
striking
and
a
spectator
is
often
unable
to
judge
whether
happiness
is
lost
on
the
whole
as
he
can
not
tell
how
far
he
who
makes
the
sacrifice
is
compensated
by
sympathetic
and
moral
pleasure
and
the
remoter
felicific
consequences
flowing
from
the
moral
effects
of
such
a
sacrifice
on
the
agent
and
on
others
have
to
be
taken
into
account
while
even
if
there
be
a
loss
in
the
particular
case
still
our
admiration
of
will
admit
of
a
certain
utilitarian
justification
because
such
conduct
shows
a
disposition
far
above
the
average
in
its
general
tendency
to
promote
happiness
and
it
is
perhaps
this
disposition
that
we
admire
rather
than
the
particular
act
it
has
been
said
however
that
the
special
claims
and
duties
belonging
to
special
relations
by
which
each
man
is
connected
with
a
few
out
of
the
whole
number
of
human
beings
are
expressly
ignored
by
the
rigid
impartiality
of
the
utilitarian
formula
and
hence
that
though
utilitarianism
and
common
sense
may
agree
in
the
proposition
that
all
right
action
is
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
some
one
or
other
and
so
far
beneficent
still
they
are
irreconcileably
divergent
on
the
radical
question
of
the
of
beneficence
here
however
it
seems
that
even
opponents
have
scarcely
understood
the
utilitarian
position
they
have
attacked
bentham
s
formula
every
man
to
count
for
one
nobody
for
more
than
one
on
the
ground
that
the
general
happiness
will
be
best
attained
by
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
each
one
s
services
but
so
far
as
it
is
clear
that
it
will
be
best
attained
in
this
way
utilitarianism
will
necessarily
prescribe
this
way
of
aiming
at
it
and
bentham
s
dictum
must
be
understood
merely
as
making
the
conception
of
the
ultimate
end
precise
laying
down
that
one
person
s
happiness
is
to
be
counted
for
as
much
as
another
s
supposed
equal
in
degree
as
an
element
of
the
general
happiness
not
as
directly
prescribing
the
rules
of
conduct
by
which
this
end
will
be
best
attained
and
the
reasons
why
it
is
generally
speaking
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
each
individual
should
distribute
his
beneficence
in
the
channels
marked
out
by
commonly
recognised
ties
and
claims
are
tolerably
obvious
for
first
in
the
chief
relations
discussed
in
chap
iv
of
book
the
domestic
and
those
constituted
by
consanguinity
friendship
previous
kindnesses
and
special
needs
the
services
which
common
sense
prescribes
as
duties
are
commonly
prompted
by
natural
affection
while
at
the
same
time
they
tend
to
develop
and
sustain
such
affection
now
the
subsistence
of
benevolent
affections
among
human
beings
is
itself
an
important
means
to
the
utilitarian
end
because
as
shaftesbury
and
his
followers
forcibly
urged
the
most
intense
and
highly
valued
of
our
pleasures
are
derived
from
such
affections
for
both
the
emotion
itself
is
highly
pleasurable
and
it
imparts
this
quality
to
the
activities
which
it
prompts
and
sustains
and
the
happiness
thus
produced
is
continually
enhanced
by
the
sympathetic
echo
of
the
pleasures
conferred
on
others
and
again
where
genuine
affection
subsists
the
practical
objections
to
spontaneous
beneficence
which
were
before
noticed
are
much
diminished
in
force
for
such
affection
tends
to
be
reciprocated
and
the
kindnesses
which
are
its
outcome
and
expression
commonly
win
a
requital
of
affection
and
in
so
far
as
this
is
the
case
they
have
less
tendency
to
weaken
the
springs
of
activity
in
the
person
benefited
and
may
even
strengthen
them
by
exciting
other
sources
of
energy
than
the
egoistic
personal
affection
and
gratitude
and
the
desire
to
deserve
love
and
the
desire
to
imitate
beneficence
and
hence
it
has
been
often
observed
that
the
injurious
effects
of
almsgiving
are
at
least
much
diminished
if
the
alms
are
bestowed
with
unaffected
sympathy
and
kindliness
and
in
such
a
way
as
to
elicit
a
genuine
response
of
gratitude
and
further
the
beneficence
that
springs
from
affection
is
less
likely
to
be
frustrated
from
defect
of
knowledge
for
not
only
are
we
powerfully
stimulated
to
study
the
real
conditions
of
the
happiness
of
those
whom
we
love
but
also
such
study
is
rendered
more
effective
from
the
sympathy
which
naturally
accompanies
affection
on
these
grounds
the
utilitarian
will
evidently
approve
of
the
cultivation
of
affection
and
the
performance
of
affectionate
services
it
may
be
said
however
that
what
we
ought
to
approve
is
not
so
much
affection
for
special
individuals
but
rather
a
feeling
more
universal
in
its
scope
charity
philanthropy
or
as
it
has
been
called
the
enthusiasm
of
and
certainly
all
special
affections
tend
occasionally
to
come
into
conflict
with
the
principle
of
promoting
the
general
happiness
and
utilitarianism
must
therefore
prescribe
such
a
culture
of
the
feelings
as
will
so
far
as
possible
counteract
this
tendency
but
it
seems
that
most
persons
are
only
capable
of
strong
affections
towards
a
few
human
beings
in
certain
close
relations
especially
the
domestic
and
that
if
these
were
suppressed
what
they
would
feel
towards
their
generally
would
be
as
aristotle
says
but
a
watery
kindness
and
a
very
feeble
counterpoise
to
so
that
such
specialised
affections
as
the
present
organisation
of
society
normally
produces
afford
the
best
means
of
developing
in
most
persons
a
more
extended
benevolence
to
the
degree
to
which
they
are
capable
of
feeling
it
besides
each
person
is
for
the
most
part
from
limitation
either
of
power
or
knowledge
not
in
a
position
to
do
much
good
to
more
than
a
very
small
number
of
persons
it
therefore
seems
on
this
ground
alone
desirable
that
his
chief
benevolent
impulses
should
be
correspondingly
limited
and
this
leads
us
to
consider
secondly
the
reasons
why
affection
apart
it
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
special
claims
to
services
should
be
commonly
recognised
as
attaching
to
special
relations
so
as
to
modify
that
impartiality
in
the
distribution
of
beneficence
which
utilitarianism
inculcates
for
clearness
sake
it
seems
best
to
take
this
argument
separately
though
it
can
not
easily
be
divided
from
the
former
one
because
the
services
in
question
are
often
such
as
can
not
so
well
be
rendered
without
affection
in
such
cases
as
we
saw
common
sense
regards
the
affection
itself
as
a
duty
in
so
far
as
it
is
capable
of
being
cultivated
but
still
prescribes
the
performance
of
the
services
even
if
the
affection
be
unhappily
absent
indeed
we
may
properly
consider
the
services
to
which
we
are
commonly
prompted
by
the
domestic
affections
and
also
those
to
which
we
are
moved
by
gratitude
and
pity
as
an
integral
part
of
the
system
of
mutual
aid
by
which
the
normal
life
and
happiness
of
society
is
maintained
under
existing
circumstances
being
an
indispensable
supplement
to
the
still
more
essential
services
which
are
definitely
prescribed
by
law
or
rendered
on
commercial
terms
as
a
part
of
an
express
bargain
as
political
economists
have
explained
the
means
of
happiness
are
immensely
increased
by
that
complex
system
of
which
has
been
gradually
organised
among
civilised
men
and
while
it
is
thought
that
under
such
a
system
it
will
be
generally
best
on
the
whole
to
let
each
individual
exchange
such
services
as
he
is
disposed
to
render
for
such
return
as
he
can
obtain
for
them
by
free
contract
still
there
are
many
large
exceptions
to
this
general
principle
of
these
the
most
important
is
constituted
by
the
case
of
children
it
is
necessary
for
the
of
mankind
that
in
each
generation
children
should
be
produced
in
adequate
numbers
neither
too
many
nor
too
few
and
that
as
they
can
not
be
left
to
provide
for
themselves
they
should
be
adequately
nourished
and
protected
during
the
period
of
infancy
and
further
that
they
should
be
carefully
trained
in
good
habits
intellectual
moral
and
physical
and
it
is
commonly
believed
that
the
best
or
even
the
only
known
means
of
attaining
these
ends
in
even
a
tolerable
degree
is
afforded
by
the
existing
institution
of
the
family
resting
as
it
does
on
a
basis
of
legal
and
moral
rules
combined
for
law
fixes
a
minimum
of
mutual
services
and
draws
the
broad
outlines
of
behaviour
for
the
different
members
of
the
family
imposing
on
the
parents
lifelong
union
and
complete
mutual
fidelity
and
the
duty
of
providing
for
their
children
the
necessaries
of
life
up
to
a
certain
age
in
return
for
which
it
gives
them
the
control
of
their
children
for
the
same
period
and
sometimes
lays
on
the
latter
the
burden
of
supporting
their
parents
when
aged
and
destitute
so
that
morality
in
inculcating
a
completer
harmony
of
interests
and
an
ampler
interchange
of
kindnesses
is
merely
filling
in
the
outlines
drawn
by
law
we
found
however
in
attempting
to
formulate
the
different
domestic
duties
as
recognised
by
common
sense
that
there
seemed
to
be
in
most
cases
a
large
vague
margin
with
respect
to
which
general
agreement
could
not
be
affirmed
and
which
in
fact
forms
an
arena
for
continual
disputes
but
we
have
now
to
observe
that
it
is
just
this
margin
which
reveals
most
clearly
the
latent
utilitarianism
of
common
moral
opinion
for
when
the
question
is
once
raised
as
to
the
precise
mutual
duties
of
husbands
and
wives
or
of
parents
and
children
each
disputant
commonly
supports
his
view
by
a
forecast
of
the
effects
on
human
happiness
to
be
expected
from
the
general
establishment
of
any
proposed
rule
this
seems
to
be
the
standard
to
which
the
matter
is
by
common
consent
referred
similarly
the
claim
to
services
that
arises
out
of
special
need
which
natural
sympathy
moves
us
to
recognise
may
obviously
be
rested
on
an
utilitarian
basis
indeed
the
proper
fulfilment
of
this
duty
seems
so
important
to
the
of
society
that
it
has
in
modern
civilised
communities
generally
been
brought
to
some
extent
within
the
sphere
of
governmental
action
we
noticed
that
the
main
utilitarian
reason
why
it
is
not
right
for
every
rich
man
to
distribute
his
superfluous
wealth
among
the
poor
is
that
the
happiness
of
all
is
on
the
whole
most
promoted
by
maintaining
in
adults
generally
except
married
women
the
expectation
that
each
will
be
thrown
on
his
own
resources
for
the
supply
of
his
own
wants
but
if
i
am
made
aware
that
owing
to
a
sudden
calamity
that
could
not
have
been
foreseen
another
s
resources
are
manifestly
inadequate
to
protect
him
from
pain
or
serious
discomfort
the
case
is
altered
my
theoretical
obligation
to
consider
his
happiness
as
much
as
my
own
becomes
at
once
practical
and
i
am
bound
to
make
as
much
effort
to
relieve
him
as
will
not
entail
a
greater
loss
of
happiness
to
myself
or
others
if
however
the
calamity
is
one
which
might
have
been
foreseen
and
averted
by
proper
care
my
duty
becomes
more
doubtful
for
then
by
relieving
him
i
seem
to
be
in
danger
of
encouraging
improvidence
in
others
in
such
a
case
a
utilitarian
has
to
weigh
this
indirect
evil
against
the
direct
good
of
removing
pain
and
distress
and
it
is
now
more
and
more
generally
recognised
that
the
question
of
providing
for
the
destitute
has
to
be
treated
as
a
utilitarian
problem
of
which
these
are
the
elements
whether
we
are
considering
the
minimum
that
should
be
secured
to
them
by
law
or
the
proper
supplementary
action
of
private
charity
poverty
however
is
not
the
only
case
in
which
it
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
one
man
should
render
unbought
services
to
another
in
any
condition
or
calling
a
man
may
find
himself
unable
to
ward
off
some
evil
or
to
realise
some
legitimate
or
worthy
end
without
assistance
of
such
kind
as
he
can
not
purchase
on
the
ordinary
commercial
terms
assistance
which
on
the
one
hand
will
have
no
bad
effect
on
the
receiver
from
the
exceptional
nature
of
the
emergency
while
at
the
same
time
it
may
not
be
burdensome
to
the
giver
here
again
some
jurists
have
thought
that
where
the
service
to
be
rendered
is
great
and
the
burden
of
rendering
it
very
slight
it
might
properly
be
made
matter
of
legal
obligation
so
that
if
i
could
save
a
man
from
drowning
by
merely
holding
out
a
hand
i
should
be
legally
punishable
if
i
omitted
the
act
but
however
this
may
be
the
moral
rule
condemning
the
refusal
of
aid
in
such
emergencies
is
obviously
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
further
besides
these
so
to
say
unbought
services
there
are
some
for
which
there
is
normally
no
such
as
counsel
and
assistance
in
the
intimate
perplexities
of
life
which
one
is
only
willing
to
receive
from
genuine
friends
it
much
promotes
the
general
happiness
that
such
services
should
be
generally
rendered
on
this
ground
as
well
as
through
the
emotional
pleasures
which
directly
spring
from
it
we
perceive
friendship
to
be
an
important
means
to
the
utilitarian
end
at
the
same
time
we
feel
that
the
charm
of
friendship
is
lost
if
the
flow
of
emotion
is
not
spontaneous
and
unforced
the
combination
of
these
two
views
seems
to
be
exactly
represented
by
the
sympathy
that
is
not
quite
admiration
with
which
common
sense
regards
all
close
and
strong
affections
and
the
regret
that
is
not
quite
disapproval
with
which
it
contemplates
their
decay
in
all
cases
where
it
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
unbought
services
should
be
rendered
gratitude
if
we
mean
by
this
a
settled
disposition
to
repay
the
benefit
in
whatever
way
one
can
on
a
fitting
opportunity
is
enjoined
by
utilitarianism
no
less
than
by
common
sense
for
experience
would
lead
us
to
expect
that
no
kind
of
onerous
services
will
be
adequately
rendered
unless
there
is
a
general
disposition
to
requite
them
in
fact
we
may
say
that
a
general
understanding
that
all
services
which
it
is
expedient
that
should
render
to
will
be
in
some
way
repaid
by
is
a
natural
supplement
of
the
more
definite
contracts
by
which
the
main
part
of
the
great
social
interchange
of
services
is
arranged
indeed
the
one
kind
of
requital
merges
in
the
other
and
no
sharp
line
can
be
drawn
between
the
two
we
can
not
always
say
distinctly
whether
the
requital
of
a
benefit
is
a
pure
act
of
gratitude
or
the
fulfilment
of
a
tacit
understanding
there
is
however
a
certain
difficulty
in
this
view
of
gratitude
as
analogous
to
the
fulfilment
of
a
bargain
for
it
may
be
said
that
of
the
services
peculiar
to
friendship
disinterestedness
is
an
indispensable
characteristic
and
that
in
all
cases
benefits
conferred
without
expectation
of
reward
have
a
peculiar
excellence
and
are
indeed
peculiarly
adapted
to
arouse
gratitude
but
if
they
are
conferred
in
expectation
of
such
gratitude
they
lose
this
excellence
and
yet
again
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
treat
as
a
friend
one
from
whom
gratitude
was
not
expected
this
seems
at
first
sight
an
inextricable
entanglement
but
here
as
in
other
cases
an
apparent
ethical
contradiction
is
found
to
reduce
itself
to
a
psychological
complexity
for
most
of
our
actions
are
done
from
several
different
motives
either
coexisting
or
succeeding
one
another
in
rapid
alternation
thus
a
man
may
have
a
perfectly
disinterested
desire
to
benefit
another
and
one
which
might
possibly
prevail
over
all
conflicting
motives
if
all
hope
of
requital
were
cut
off
and
yet
it
may
be
well
that
this
generous
impulse
should
be
sustained
by
a
vague
trust
that
requital
will
not
be
withheld
and
in
fact
the
apparent
puzzle
really
affords
another
illustration
of
the
latent
utilitarianism
of
common
sense
for
on
the
one
hand
utilitarianism
prescribes
that
we
should
render
services
whenever
it
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
to
do
so
which
may
often
be
the
case
without
taking
into
account
the
gain
to
oneself
which
would
result
from
their
requital
and
on
the
other
hand
since
we
may
infer
from
the
actual
selfishness
of
average
men
that
such
services
would
not
be
adequately
rendered
without
expectation
of
requital
it
is
also
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
men
should
recognise
a
moral
obligation
to
repay
them
we
have
discussed
only
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
duties
of
affection
but
it
is
probably
obvious
that
similar
reasonings
would
apply
in
the
case
of
the
others
in
all
such
cases
there
are
three
distinct
lines
of
argument
which
tend
to
show
that
the
commonly
received
view
of
special
claims
and
duties
arising
out
of
special
relations
though
opposed
to
the
impartial
universality
of
the
utilitarian
principle
is
really
maintained
by
a
application
of
that
principle
first
morality
is
here
in
a
manner
protecting
the
normal
channels
and
courses
of
natural
benevolent
affections
and
the
development
of
such
affections
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
human
happiness
both
as
a
direct
source
of
pleasure
and
as
an
indispensable
preparation
for
a
more
enlarged
and
again
the
mere
fact
that
such
affections
are
normal
causes
an
expectation
of
the
services
that
are
their
natural
expression
and
the
disappointment
of
such
expectations
is
inevitably
painful
while
finally
apart
from
these
considerations
we
can
show
in
each
case
strong
utilitarian
reasons
why
generally
speaking
services
should
be
rendered
to
the
persons
commonly
recognised
as
having
such
claims
rather
than
to
others
we
have
to
observe
in
conclusion
that
the
difficulties
which
we
found
in
the
way
of
determining
by
the
intuitional
method
the
limits
and
the
relative
importance
of
these
duties
are
reduced
in
the
utilitarian
system
to
difficulties
of
hedonistic
comparison
for
each
of
the
preceding
arguments
has
shown
us
different
kinds
of
pleasures
gained
and
pains
averted
by
the
fulfilment
of
the
claims
in
question
there
are
first
those
which
the
service
claimed
would
directly
promote
or
avert
secondly
there
is
the
pain
and
secondary
harm
of
disappointed
expectation
if
the
service
be
not
rendered
thirdly
we
have
to
reckon
the
various
pleasures
connected
with
the
exercise
of
natural
benevolent
affections
especially
when
reciprocated
including
the
indirect
effects
on
the
agent
s
character
of
maintaining
such
affections
all
these
different
pleasures
and
pains
combine
differently
and
with
almost
infinite
variation
as
circumstances
vary
into
utilitarian
reasons
for
each
of
the
claims
in
question
none
of
these
reasons
being
absolute
and
conclusive
but
each
having
its
own
weight
while
liable
to
be
outweighed
by
others
i
pass
to
consider
another
group
of
duties
often
contrasted
with
those
of
benevolence
under
the
comprehensive
notion
of
justice
that
justice
is
useful
to
society
says
hume
it
would
be
a
superfluous
undertaking
to
prove
what
he
endeavours
to
show
at
some
length
is
that
public
utility
is
the
origin
of
justice
and
the
same
question
of
origin
has
occupied
the
chief
attention
of
s
mill
here
however
we
are
not
so
much
concerned
with
the
growth
of
the
sentiment
of
justice
from
experiences
of
utility
as
with
the
utilitarian
basis
of
the
mature
notion
while
at
the
same
time
if
the
analysis
previously
given
be
correct
the
justice
that
is
commonly
demanded
and
inculcated
is
something
more
complex
than
these
writers
have
recognised
what
hume
means
by
justice
is
rather
what
i
should
call
order
understood
in
its
widest
sense
the
observance
of
the
actual
system
of
rules
whether
strictly
legal
or
customary
which
bind
together
the
different
members
of
any
society
into
an
organic
whole
checking
malevolent
or
otherwise
injurious
impulses
distributing
the
different
objects
of
men
s
clashing
desires
and
exacting
such
positive
services
customary
or
contractual
as
are
commonly
recognised
as
matters
of
debt
and
though
there
have
rarely
been
wanting
plausible
empirical
arguments
for
the
revolutionary
paradox
quoted
by
plato
that
laws
are
imposed
in
the
interest
of
rulers
it
remains
true
that
the
general
conduciveness
to
social
happiness
of
the
habit
of
order
or
is
as
hume
says
too
obvious
to
need
proof
indeed
it
is
of
such
paramount
importance
to
a
community
that
even
where
particular
laws
are
clearly
injurious
it
is
usually
expedient
to
observe
them
apart
from
any
penalty
which
their
breach
might
entail
on
the
individual
we
saw
however
that
common
sense
sometimes
bids
us
refuse
obedience
to
bad
laws
because
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
though
there
seems
to
be
no
clear
intuition
as
to
the
kind
or
degree
of
badness
that
justifies
resistance
and
further
allows
us
in
special
emergencies
to
violate
rules
generally
good
for
necessity
has
no
law
and
salus
populi
suprema
these
and
similar
common
opinions
seem
at
least
to
suggest
that
the
limits
of
the
duty
of
are
to
be
determined
by
utilitarian
considerations
while
again
the
utilitarian
view
gets
rid
of
the
difficulties
in
which
the
attempt
to
define
intuitively
the
truly
legitimate
source
of
legislative
authority
involved
us
at
the
same
time
that
it
justifies
to
some
extent
each
of
the
different
views
current
as
to
the
intrinsic
legitimacy
of
governments
for
on
the
one
hand
it
finds
the
moral
basis
of
any
established
political
order
primarily
in
its
effects
rather
than
its
causes
so
that
generally
speaking
obedience
will
seem
due
to
any
government
that
is
not
governing
very
badly
on
the
other
hand
in
so
far
as
laws
originating
in
a
particular
way
are
likely
to
be
better
or
more
readily
observed
it
is
a
utilitarian
duty
to
aim
at
introducing
this
mode
of
origination
and
thus
in
a
certain
stage
of
social
development
it
may
be
right
that
a
representative
system
should
be
popularly
demanded
or
possibly
in
extreme
cases
even
introduced
by
force
while
again
there
is
expediency
in
maintaining
an
ancient
mode
of
legislation
because
men
readily
obey
such
and
loyalty
to
a
dispossessed
government
may
be
on
the
whole
expedient
even
at
the
cost
of
some
temporary
suffering
and
disorder
in
order
that
ambitious
men
may
not
find
usurpation
too
easy
here
as
elsewhere
utilitarianism
at
once
supports
the
different
reasons
commonly
put
forward
as
absolute
and
also
brings
them
theoretically
to
a
common
measure
so
that
in
any
particular
case
we
have
a
principle
of
decision
between
conflicting
political
arguments
as
was
before
said
this
in
so
far
at
least
as
it
affects
the
interests
of
other
individuals
is
what
we
frequently
mean
by
justice
it
seems
however
that
the
notion
of
justice
exhaustively
analysed
includes
several
distinct
elements
combined
in
a
somewhat
complex
manner
we
have
to
inquire
therefore
what
latent
utilities
are
represented
by
each
of
these
elements
now
first
a
constant
part
of
the
notion
which
appears
in
it
even
when
the
just
is
not
distinguished
from
the
legal
is
impartiality
or
the
negation
of
arbitrary
inequality
this
impartiality
as
we
saw
whether
exhibited
in
the
establishment
or
in
the
administration
of
laws
is
merely
a
special
application
of
the
wider
maxim
that
it
can
not
be
right
to
treat
two
persons
differently
if
their
cases
are
similar
in
all
material
circumstances
and
utilitarianism
as
we
saw
admits
this
maxim
no
less
than
other
systems
of
ethics
at
the
same
time
this
negative
criterion
is
clearly
inadequate
for
the
complete
determination
of
what
is
just
in
laws
or
in
conduct
generally
when
we
have
admitted
this
it
still
remains
to
ask
what
are
the
inequalities
in
laws
and
in
the
distribution
of
pleasures
and
pains
outside
the
sphere
of
law
which
are
not
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
to
what
general
principles
can
they
be
reduced
here
in
the
first
place
we
may
explain
on
utilitarian
principles
why
apparently
arbitrary
inequality
in
a
certain
part
of
the
conduct
of
individuals
is
not
regarded
as
injustice
or
even
in
some
cases
as
in
any
way
censurable
for
freedom
of
action
is
an
important
source
of
happiness
to
the
agents
and
a
socially
useful
stimulus
to
their
energies
hence
it
is
obviously
expedient
that
a
man
s
free
choice
in
the
distribution
of
wealth
or
kind
services
should
not
be
restrained
by
the
fear
of
legal
penalties
or
even
of
social
disapprobation
beyond
what
the
interests
of
others
clearly
require
and
therefore
when
distinctly
recognised
claims
are
satisfied
it
is
expedient
that
the
mere
preferences
of
an
individual
should
be
treated
by
others
as
legitimate
grounds
for
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
his
property
or
services
nay
as
we
have
before
seen
it
is
within
certain
limits
expedient
that
each
individual
should
practically
regard
his
own
unreasoned
impulses
as
reasonable
grounds
of
action
as
in
the
rendering
of
services
prompted
by
such
affections
as
are
normally
and
properly
spontaneous
and
unforced
passing
to
consider
the
general
principles
upon
which
just
claims
as
commonly
recognised
appear
to
be
based
we
notice
that
the
grounds
of
a
number
of
such
claims
may
be
brought
under
the
general
head
of
normal
expectations
but
that
the
stringency
of
such
obligations
varies
much
in
degree
according
as
the
expectations
are
based
upon
definite
engagements
or
on
some
vague
mutual
understanding
or
are
merely
such
as
an
average
man
would
form
from
past
experience
of
the
conduct
of
other
men
in
these
latter
cases
common
sense
appeared
to
be
somewhat
perplexed
as
to
the
validity
of
the
claims
but
for
the
utilitarian
the
difficulty
has
ceased
to
exist
he
will
hold
any
disappointment
of
expectations
to
be
an
evil
but
a
greater
evil
in
proportion
to
the
previous
security
of
the
expectant
individual
from
the
greater
shock
thus
given
to
his
reliance
on
the
conduct
of
his
generally
and
many
times
greater
in
proportion
as
the
expectation
is
generally
recognised
as
normal
and
reasonable
as
in
this
case
the
shock
extends
to
all
who
are
in
any
way
cognisant
of
his
disappointment
the
importance
to
mankind
of
being
able
to
rely
on
each
other
s
actions
is
so
great
that
in
ordinary
cases
of
absolutely
definite
engagements
there
is
scarcely
any
advantage
that
can
counterbalance
the
harm
done
by
violating
them
still
we
found
that
several
exceptions
and
qualifications
to
the
rule
of
good
faith
were
more
or
less
distinctly
recognised
by
common
sense
and
most
of
these
have
a
utilitarian
basis
which
it
does
not
need
much
penetration
to
discern
to
begin
we
may
notice
that
the
superficial
view
of
the
obligation
of
a
promise
which
makes
it
depend
on
the
assertion
of
the
promiser
and
not
as
utilitarians
hold
on
the
expectations
produced
in
the
promisee
can
not
fairly
be
attributed
to
common
sense
which
certainly
condemns
a
breach
of
promise
much
more
strongly
when
others
have
acted
in
reliance
on
it
than
when
its
observance
did
not
directly
concern
others
so
that
its
breach
involves
for
them
only
the
indirect
evil
of
a
bad
precedent
as
when
a
man
breaks
a
pledge
of
total
abstinence
we
see
again
how
the
utilitarian
reasons
for
keeping
a
promise
are
diminished
by
a
material
change
of
circumstances
for
in
that
case
the
expectations
disappointed
by
breaking
it
are
at
least
not
those
which
the
promise
originally
created
it
is
obvious
too
that
it
is
a
disadvantage
to
the
community
that
men
should
be
able
to
rely
on
the
performance
of
promises
procured
by
fraud
or
unlawful
force
so
far
as
encouragement
is
thereby
given
to
the
use
of
fraud
or
force
for
this
end
we
saw
again
that
when
the
performance
would
be
injurious
to
the
promisee
common
sense
is
disposed
to
admit
that
its
obligation
is
superseded
and
is
at
least
doubtful
whether
the
promise
should
be
kept
even
when
it
is
only
the
promiser
who
would
be
injured
if
the
harm
be
extreme
both
which
qualifications
are
in
harmony
with
utilitarianism
and
similarly
for
the
other
qualifications
and
exceptions
they
all
turn
out
to
be
as
clearly
utilitarian
as
the
general
utility
of
keeping
one
s
word
is
plain
and
manifest
but
further
the
expediency
of
satisfying
normal
expectations
even
when
they
are
not
based
upon
a
definite
contract
is
undeniable
it
will
clearly
conduce
to
the
tranquillity
of
social
existence
and
to
the
settled
and
activity
on
which
social
happiness
greatly
depends
that
such
expectations
should
be
as
little
as
possible
baulked
and
here
utilitarianism
relieves
us
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
the
common
view
of
just
conduct
as
something
absolutely
precise
and
definite
for
in
this
vaguer
region
we
can
not
draw
a
sharp
line
between
valid
and
invalid
claims
injustice
shades
gradually
off
into
mere
hence
the
utilitarian
view
that
the
disappointment
of
natural
expectations
is
an
evil
but
an
evil
which
must
sometimes
be
incurred
for
the
sake
of
a
greater
good
is
that
to
which
common
sense
is
practically
forced
though
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
it
with
the
theoretical
absoluteness
of
justice
in
the
intuitional
view
of
morality
the
gain
of
recognising
the
relativity
of
this
obligation
will
be
still
more
felt
when
we
consider
what
i
distinguished
as
ideal
justice
and
examine
the
general
conceptions
of
this
which
we
find
expressed
or
latent
in
current
criticisms
of
the
existing
order
of
society
we
have
seen
that
there
are
two
competing
views
of
an
ideally
just
social
order
or
perhaps
we
may
say
two
extreme
types
between
which
the
looser
notions
of
ordinary
men
seem
to
fluctuate
which
i
called
respectively
individualistic
and
socialistic
according
to
the
former
view
an
ideal
system
of
law
ought
to
aim
at
freedom
or
perfect
mutual
of
all
the
members
of
the
community
as
an
absolute
end
now
the
general
utilitarian
reasons
for
leaving
each
rational
adult
free
to
seek
happiness
in
his
own
way
are
obvious
and
striking
for
generally
speaking
each
is
best
qualified
to
provide
for
his
own
interests
since
even
when
he
does
not
know
best
what
they
are
and
how
to
attain
them
he
is
at
any
rate
most
keenly
concerned
for
them
and
again
the
consciousness
of
freedom
and
concomitant
responsibility
increases
the
average
effective
activity
of
men
and
besides
the
discomfort
of
constraint
is
directly
an
evil
and
to
be
avoided
still
we
saw
that
the
attempt
to
construct
a
consistent
code
of
laws
taking
maximum
freedom
instead
of
happiness
as
an
absolute
end
must
lead
to
startling
paradoxes
and
insoluble
puzzles
and
in
fact
the
practical
interpretation
of
the
notion
freedom
and
the
limits
within
which
its
realisation
has
been
actually
sought
have
always
even
in
the
freest
societies
been
more
or
less
consciously
determined
by
considerations
of
expediency
so
that
we
may
fairly
say
that
in
so
far
as
common
sense
has
adopted
the
individualistic
ideal
in
politics
it
has
always
been
as
subordinate
to
and
limited
by
the
utilitarian
first
principle
it
seems
however
that
what
we
commonly
demand
or
long
for
under
the
name
of
ideal
justice
is
not
so
much
the
realisation
of
freedom
as
the
distribution
of
good
and
evil
according
to
desert
indeed
it
is
as
a
means
to
this
latter
end
that
freedom
is
often
advocated
for
it
is
said
that
if
we
protect
men
completely
from
mutual
interference
each
will
reap
the
good
and
bad
consequences
of
his
own
conduct
and
so
be
happy
or
unhappy
in
proportion
to
his
deserts
in
particular
it
has
been
widely
held
that
if
a
free
exchange
of
wealth
and
services
is
allowed
each
individual
will
obtain
from
society
in
money
or
other
advantages
what
his
services
are
really
worth
we
saw
however
that
the
price
which
an
individual
obtains
under
a
system
of
perfect
free
trade
for
wealth
or
services
exchanged
by
him
may
for
several
reasons
be
not
proportioned
to
the
social
utility
of
what
he
exchanges
and
reflective
common
sense
seems
to
admit
this
disproportion
as
to
some
extent
legitimate
under
the
influence
of
utilitarian
considerations
correcting
the
unreflective
utterances
of
moral
sentiments
to
take
a
particular
case
if
a
moral
man
were
asked
how
far
it
is
right
to
take
advantage
in
bargaining
of
another
s
ignorance
probably
his
first
impulse
would
be
to
condemn
such
a
procedure
altogether
but
reflection
i
think
would
show
him
that
such
a
censure
would
be
too
sweeping
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
common
sense
to
blame
for
having
in
negotiating
with
a
stranger
taken
advantage
of
s
ignorance
of
facts
known
to
himself
provided
that
s
superior
knowledge
had
been
obtained
by
a
legitimate
use
of
diligence
and
foresight
which
might
have
used
with
equal
success
what
prevents
us
from
censuring
in
this
and
similar
cases
is
i
conceive
a
more
or
less
conscious
apprehension
of
the
indefinite
loss
to
the
wealth
of
the
community
that
is
likely
to
result
from
any
effective
social
restrictions
on
the
free
pursuit
and
exercise
of
economic
knowledge
and
for
somewhat
similar
reasons
of
general
expediency
if
the
question
be
raised
whether
it
is
fair
for
a
class
of
persons
to
gain
by
the
unfavourable
economic
situation
of
any
class
with
which
they
deal
common
sense
at
least
hesitates
to
censure
such
gains
at
any
rate
when
such
unfavourable
situation
is
due
to
the
gradual
action
of
general
causes
for
the
existence
of
which
the
persons
who
gain
are
not
specially
the
general
principle
of
requiting
good
desert
so
far
as
common
sense
really
accepts
it
as
practically
applicable
to
the
relations
of
men
in
society
is
broadly
in
harmony
with
utilitarianism
since
we
obviously
encourage
the
production
of
general
happiness
by
rewarding
men
for
felicific
conduct
only
the
utilitarian
scale
of
rewards
will
not
be
determined
entirely
by
the
magnitude
of
the
services
performed
but
partly
also
by
the
difficulty
of
inducing
men
to
perform
them
but
this
latter
element
seems
to
be
always
taken
into
account
though
perhaps
unconsciously
by
common
sense
for
as
we
have
been
led
to
notice
we
do
not
commonly
recognise
merit
in
right
actions
if
they
are
such
as
men
are
naturally
inclined
to
perform
rather
too
much
than
too
little
again
in
cases
where
the
intuitional
principle
that
lies
in
wrong
intention
conflicts
with
the
utilitarian
view
of
punishment
as
purely
preventive
we
find
that
in
the
actual
administration
of
criminal
justice
common
sense
is
forced
however
reluctantly
into
practical
agreement
with
utilitarianism
thus
after
a
civil
war
it
demands
the
execution
of
the
most
purely
patriotic
rebels
and
after
a
railway
accident
it
clamours
for
the
severe
punishment
of
unintentional
neglects
which
except
for
their
consequences
would
have
been
regarded
as
very
venial
if
however
in
any
distribution
of
pleasures
and
privileges
or
of
pains
and
burdens
considerations
of
desert
do
not
properly
come
in
if
the
good
or
evil
to
be
distributed
have
no
relation
to
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
persons
who
are
to
receive
either
or
if
it
is
practically
impossible
to
take
such
considerations
into
account
then
common
sense
seems
to
fall
back
on
simple
equality
as
the
principle
of
just
apportionment
and
we
have
seen
that
the
utilitarian
in
the
case
supposed
will
reasonably
accept
equality
as
the
only
mode
of
distribution
that
is
not
arbitrary
and
it
may
be
observed
that
this
mode
of
apportioning
the
means
of
happiness
is
likely
to
produce
more
happiness
on
the
whole
not
only
because
men
have
a
disinterested
aversion
to
unreason
but
still
more
because
they
have
an
aversion
to
any
kind
of
inferiority
to
others
which
is
much
intensified
when
the
inferiority
seems
unreasonable
this
latter
feeling
is
so
strong
that
it
often
prevails
in
spite
of
obvious
claims
of
desert
and
it
may
even
be
sometimes
expedient
that
it
should
so
prevail
for
finally
it
must
be
observed
that
utilitarianism
furnishes
us
with
a
common
standard
to
which
the
different
elements
included
in
the
notion
of
justice
may
be
reduced
such
a
standard
is
imperatively
required
as
these
different
elements
are
continually
liable
to
conflict
with
each
other
the
issue
for
example
in
practical
politics
between
conservatives
and
reformers
often
represents
such
a
conflict
the
question
is
whether
we
ought
to
do
a
certain
violence
to
expectations
arising
naturally
out
of
the
existing
social
order
with
the
view
of
bringing
about
a
distribution
of
the
means
of
happiness
more
in
accordance
with
ideal
justice
here
if
my
analysis
of
the
common
notion
of
justice
be
sound
the
attempt
to
extract
from
it
a
clear
decision
of
such
an
issue
must
necessarily
fail
as
the
conflict
is
so
to
say
permanently
latent
in
the
very
core
of
common
sense
but
the
utilitarian
will
merely
use
this
notion
of
justice
as
a
guide
to
different
kinds
of
utilities
and
in
so
far
as
these
are
incompatible
he
will
balance
one
set
of
advantages
against
the
other
and
decide
according
to
the
preponderance
the
duty
of
is
sometimes
taken
as
a
striking
instance
of
a
moral
rule
not
resting
on
a
utilitarian
basis
but
a
careful
study
of
the
qualifications
with
which
the
common
opinion
of
mankind
actually
inculcates
this
duty
seems
to
lead
us
to
an
opposite
result
for
not
only
is
the
general
utility
of
so
manifest
as
to
need
no
proof
but
wherever
this
utility
seems
to
be
absent
or
outweighed
by
particular
bad
consequences
we
find
that
common
sense
at
least
hesitates
to
enforce
the
rule
for
example
if
a
man
be
pursuing
criminal
ends
it
is
injurious
to
the
community
that
he
should
be
aided
in
his
pursuit
by
being
able
to
rely
on
the
assertions
of
others
here
then
deception
is
legitimate
as
a
protection
against
crime
though
when
we
consider
the
bad
effects
on
habit
and
through
example
of
even
a
single
act
of
unveracity
the
case
is
seen
to
be
on
utilitarian
principles
doubtful
and
this
is
just
the
view
of
common
sense
again
though
it
is
generally
a
man
s
interest
to
know
the
truth
there
are
exceptional
cases
in
which
it
is
injurious
to
him
as
when
an
invalid
hears
bad
news
and
here
too
common
sense
is
disposed
to
suspend
the
rule
again
we
found
it
difficult
to
define
exactly
wherein
veracity
consists
for
we
may
either
require
truth
in
the
spoken
words
or
in
the
inferences
which
the
speaker
foresees
will
be
drawn
from
them
or
in
both
perfect
candour
no
doubt
would
require
it
in
both
but
in
the
various
circumstances
where
this
seems
inexpedient
we
often
find
common
sense
at
least
to
dispense
with
one
or
other
part
of
the
double
obligation
thus
we
found
a
respectable
school
of
thinkers
maintaining
that
a
religious
truth
may
properly
be
communicated
by
means
of
a
historical
fiction
and
on
the
other
hand
the
unsuitability
of
perfect
frankness
to
our
existing
social
relations
is
recognised
in
the
common
rules
of
politeness
which
impose
on
us
not
unfrequently
the
necessity
of
suppressing
truths
and
suggesting
falsehoods
i
would
not
say
that
in
any
of
these
cases
common
sense
pronounces
quite
decidedly
in
favour
of
unveracity
but
then
neither
is
utilitarianism
decided
as
the
utility
of
maintaining
a
general
habit
of
is
so
great
that
it
is
not
easy
to
prove
it
to
be
clearly
outweighed
by
even
strong
special
reasons
for
violating
the
rule
yet
it
may
be
worth
while
to
point
out
how
the
different
views
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
malevolent
impulses
out
of
which
we
found
it
hard
to
frame
a
consistent
doctrine
for
common
sense
exactly
correspond
to
different
forecasts
of
the
consequences
of
gratifying
such
impulses
the
desire
to
injure
any
one
in
particular
is
inconsistent
with
a
deliberate
purpose
of
benefiting
as
much
as
possible
people
in
general
accordingly
we
find
that
what
i
may
call
superficial
common
sense
passes
a
sweeping
condemnation
on
such
desires
but
a
study
of
the
actual
facts
of
society
shows
that
resentment
plays
an
important
part
in
that
repression
of
injuries
which
is
necessary
to
social
wellbeing
accordingly
the
reflective
moralist
shrinks
from
excluding
it
altogether
it
is
evident
however
that
personal
is
a
very
dangerous
means
to
the
general
happiness
for
its
direct
end
is
the
exact
opposite
of
happiness
and
though
the
realisation
of
this
end
may
in
certain
cases
be
the
least
of
two
evils
still
the
impulse
if
encouraged
is
likely
to
prompt
to
the
infliction
of
pain
beyond
the
limits
of
just
punishment
and
to
have
an
injurious
reaction
on
the
character
of
the
angry
person
accordingly
the
moralist
is
disposed
to
prescribe
that
indignation
be
directed
always
against
acts
and
not
against
persons
and
if
indignation
so
restricted
would
be
efficient
in
repressing
injuries
this
would
seem
to
be
the
state
of
mind
most
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
average
human
nature
is
capable
of
maintaining
this
distinction
and
whether
if
it
could
be
maintained
the
more
refined
aversion
would
by
itself
be
sufficiently
efficacious
accordingly
common
sense
hesitates
to
condemn
personal
against
even
if
it
includes
a
desire
of
malevolent
satisfaction
finally
it
is
easy
to
show
that
temperance
and
what
are
called
the
virtues
generally
are
useful
to
the
individual
who
possesses
them
and
if
it
is
not
quite
clear
in
the
view
of
common
sense
to
what
end
that
regulation
and
government
of
appetites
and
passions
which
moralists
have
so
much
inculcated
and
admired
is
to
be
directed
at
least
there
seems
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
our
defining
this
end
as
happiness
and
even
in
the
ascetic
extreme
of
which
has
sometimes
led
to
the
repudiation
of
sensual
pleasures
as
radically
bad
we
may
trace
an
unconscious
utilitarianism
for
the
ascetic
condemnation
has
always
been
chiefly
directed
against
those
pleasures
in
respect
of
which
men
are
especially
liable
to
commit
excesses
dangerous
to
health
and
free
indulgence
in
which
even
when
it
keeps
clear
of
injury
to
health
is
thought
to
interfere
with
the
development
of
other
faculties
and
susceptibilities
which
are
important
sources
of
happiness
an
apparent
exception
to
this
statement
may
seem
to
be
constituted
in
the
case
of
the
sexual
appetite
by
the
regulation
prescribed
under
the
notion
of
purity
or
chastity
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
this
head
we
find
condemned
with
special
vehemence
and
severity
acts
of
which
the
immediate
effect
is
pleasure
not
obviously
outweighed
by
subsequent
pain
but
a
closer
examination
of
this
exception
transforms
it
into
an
important
contribution
to
the
present
argument
as
it
shows
a
specially
complex
and
delicate
correspondence
between
moral
sentiments
and
social
utilities
in
the
first
place
the
peculiar
intensity
and
delicacy
of
the
moral
sentiments
that
govern
the
relations
of
the
sexes
are
thoroughly
justified
by
the
vast
importance
to
society
of
the
end
to
which
they
are
obviously
a
means
the
maintenance
namely
of
the
permanent
unions
which
are
held
to
be
necessary
for
the
proper
rearing
and
training
of
children
hence
the
first
and
fundamental
rule
in
this
department
is
that
which
directly
secures
conjugal
fidelity
and
the
utilitarian
grounds
for
protecting
marriage
indirectly
by
condemning
all
intercourse
of
the
sexes
are
obvious
for
to
remove
the
moral
censure
that
rests
on
such
intercourse
would
seriously
diminish
men
s
motives
for
incurring
the
restraints
and
burdens
which
marriage
entails
and
the
youth
of
both
sexes
would
form
habits
of
feeling
and
conduct
tending
to
unfit
them
for
marriage
and
if
such
intercourse
were
fertile
it
would
be
attended
with
that
imperfect
care
of
the
succeeding
generation
which
it
seems
the
object
of
permanent
unions
to
prevent
while
if
it
were
sterile
the
future
of
the
human
race
would
as
far
as
we
can
see
be
still
more
profoundly
imperilled
but
further
it
is
only
on
utilitarian
principles
that
we
can
account
for
the
anomalous
difference
which
the
morality
of
common
sense
has
always
made
between
the
two
sexes
as
regards
the
simple
offence
of
unchastity
for
the
offence
is
commonly
more
deliberate
in
the
man
who
has
the
additional
guilt
of
soliciting
and
persuading
the
woman
in
the
latter
again
it
is
far
more
often
prompted
by
some
motive
that
we
rank
higher
than
mere
lust
so
that
according
to
the
ordinary
canons
of
intuitional
morality
it
ought
to
be
more
severely
condemned
in
the
man
the
actual
inversion
of
this
result
can
only
be
justified
by
taking
into
account
the
greater
interest
that
society
has
in
maintaining
a
high
standard
of
female
chastity
for
the
degradation
of
this
standard
must
strike
at
the
root
of
family
life
by
impairing
men
s
security
in
the
exercise
of
their
parental
affections
but
there
is
no
corresponding
consequence
of
male
unchastity
which
may
therefore
prevail
to
a
considerable
extent
without
imperilling
the
very
existence
of
the
family
though
it
impairs
its
wellbeing
at
the
same
time
the
condemnation
of
unchastity
in
men
by
the
common
moral
sense
of
christian
countries
at
the
present
day
is
sufficiently
clear
and
explicit
though
we
recognise
the
existence
of
a
laxer
code
the
morality
as
it
is
called
of
the
world
which
treats
it
as
indifferent
or
very
venial
but
the
very
difference
between
the
two
codes
gives
a
kind
of
support
to
the
present
argument
as
it
corresponds
to
easily
explained
differences
of
insight
into
the
consequences
of
maintaining
certain
moral
sanctions
for
partly
it
is
thought
by
men
of
the
world
that
men
can
not
practically
be
restrained
from
sexual
indulgence
at
least
at
the
period
of
life
when
the
passions
are
strongest
and
hence
that
it
is
expedient
to
tolerate
such
kind
and
degree
of
illicit
sexual
intercourse
as
is
not
directly
dangerous
to
the
wellbeing
of
families
partly
again
it
is
maintained
by
some
in
bolder
antagonism
to
common
sense
that
the
existence
of
a
certain
limited
amount
of
such
intercourse
with
a
special
class
of
women
carefully
separated
as
at
present
from
the
rest
of
society
is
scarcely
a
real
evil
and
may
even
be
a
positive
gain
in
respect
of
general
happiness
for
continence
is
perhaps
somewhat
dangerous
to
health
and
in
any
case
involves
a
loss
of
pleasure
considerable
in
intensity
while
at
the
same
time
the
maintenance
of
as
numerous
a
population
as
is
desirable
in
an
old
society
does
not
require
that
more
than
a
certain
proportion
of
the
women
in
each
generation
should
become
mothers
of
families
and
if
some
of
the
surplus
make
it
their
profession
to
enter
into
casual
and
temporary
sexual
relations
with
men
there
is
no
necessity
that
their
lives
should
compare
disadvantageously
in
respect
of
happiness
with
those
of
other
women
in
the
less
favoured
classes
of
society
this
view
has
perhaps
a
superficial
plausibility
but
it
ignores
the
essential
fact
that
it
is
only
by
the
present
severe
enforcement
against
unchaste
women
of
the
penalties
of
social
contempt
and
exclusion
resting
on
moral
disapprobation
that
the
class
of
courtesans
is
kept
sufficiently
separate
from
the
rest
of
female
society
to
prevent
the
contagion
of
unchastity
from
spreading
and
that
the
illicit
intercourse
of
the
sexes
is
restrained
within
such
limits
as
not
to
interfere
materially
with
the
due
development
of
the
race
this
consideration
is
sufficient
to
decide
a
utilitarian
to
support
generally
the
established
rule
against
this
kind
of
conduct
and
therefore
to
condemn
violations
of
the
rule
as
on
the
whole
infelicific
even
though
they
may
perhaps
appear
to
have
this
quality
only
in
consequence
of
the
moral
censure
attached
to
them
further
the
man
of
the
world
ignores
the
vast
importance
to
the
human
race
of
maintaining
that
higher
type
of
sexual
relations
which
is
not
generally
speaking
possible
except
where
a
high
value
is
set
upon
chastity
in
both
sexes
from
this
point
of
view
the
virtue
of
purity
may
be
regarded
as
providing
a
necessary
shelter
under
which
that
intense
and
elevated
affection
between
the
sexes
which
is
most
conducive
both
to
the
happiness
of
the
individual
and
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
family
may
grow
and
flourish
and
in
this
way
we
are
able
to
explain
what
must
have
perplexed
many
reflective
minds
in
contemplating
the
regulation
of
conduct
under
the
head
of
purity
viz
that
on
the
one
hand
the
sentiment
that
supports
these
rules
is
very
intense
so
that
the
subjective
difference
between
right
and
wrong
in
this
department
is
marked
with
peculiar
strength
while
on
the
other
hand
it
is
found
impossible
to
give
a
clear
definition
of
the
conduct
condemned
under
this
notion
for
the
impulse
to
be
restrained
is
so
powerful
and
so
sensitive
to
stimulants
of
all
kinds
that
in
order
that
the
sentiment
of
purity
may
adequately
perform
its
protective
function
it
is
required
to
be
very
keen
and
vivid
and
the
aversion
to
impurity
must
extend
far
beyond
the
acts
that
primarily
need
to
be
prohibited
and
include
in
its
scope
everything
in
dress
language
social
customs
etc
which
may
tend
to
excite
lascivious
ideas
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
line
between
right
and
wrong
in
such
matters
should
be
drawn
with
theoretical
precision
it
is
sufficient
for
practical
purposes
if
the
main
central
portion
of
the
region
of
duty
be
strongly
illuminated
while
the
margin
is
left
somewhat
obscure
and
in
fact
the
detailed
regulations
which
it
is
important
to
society
to
maintain
depend
so
much
upon
habit
and
association
of
ideas
that
they
must
vary
to
a
great
extent
from
age
to
age
and
from
country
to
country
the
preceding
survey
has
supplied
us
with
several
illustrations
of
the
manner
in
which
utilitarianism
is
normally
introduced
as
a
method
for
deciding
between
different
conflicting
claims
in
cases
where
common
sense
leaves
their
relative
importance
obscure
as
between
the
different
duties
of
the
affections
and
the
different
principles
which
analysis
shows
to
be
involved
in
our
common
conception
of
justice
and
we
have
also
noticed
how
when
a
dispute
is
raised
as
to
the
precise
scope
and
definition
of
any
current
moral
rule
the
effects
of
different
acceptations
of
the
rule
on
general
happiness
or
social
wellbeing
are
commonly
regarded
as
the
ultimate
grounds
on
which
the
dispute
is
to
be
decided
in
fact
these
two
arguments
practically
run
into
one
for
it
is
generally
a
conflict
between
maxims
that
impresses
men
with
the
need
of
giving
each
a
precise
definition
it
may
be
urged
that
the
consequences
to
which
reference
is
commonly
made
in
such
cases
are
rather
effects
on
social
wellbeing
than
on
general
happiness
as
understood
by
utilitarians
and
that
the
two
notions
ought
not
to
be
identified
i
grant
this
but
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
preceding
book
i
have
tried
to
show
that
common
sense
is
unconsciously
utilitarian
in
its
practical
determination
of
those
very
elements
in
the
notion
of
ultimate
good
or
wellbeing
which
at
first
sight
least
admit
of
a
hedonistic
interpretation
we
may
now
observe
that
this
hypothesis
of
unconscious
utilitarianism
explains
the
different
relative
importance
attached
to
particular
virtues
by
different
classes
of
human
beings
and
the
different
emphasis
with
which
the
same
virtue
is
inculcated
on
these
different
classes
by
mankind
generally
for
such
differences
ordinarily
correspond
to
variations
real
or
apparent
in
the
utilitarian
importance
of
the
virtues
under
different
circumstances
thus
we
have
noticed
the
greater
stress
laid
on
chastity
in
women
than
in
men
courage
on
the
other
hand
is
more
valued
in
the
latter
as
they
are
more
called
upon
to
cope
energetically
with
sudden
and
severe
dangers
and
for
similar
reasons
a
soldier
is
expected
to
show
a
higher
degree
of
courage
than
a
priest
again
though
we
esteem
candour
and
scrupulous
sincerity
in
most
persons
we
scarcely
look
for
them
in
a
diplomatist
who
has
to
conceal
secrets
nor
do
we
expect
that
a
tradesman
in
describing
his
goods
should
frankly
point
out
their
defects
to
his
customers
finally
when
we
compare
the
different
moral
codes
of
different
ages
and
countries
we
see
that
the
discrepancies
among
them
correspond
at
least
to
a
great
extent
to
differences
either
in
the
actual
effects
of
actions
on
happiness
or
in
the
extent
to
which
such
effects
are
generally
foreseen
or
regarded
as
important
by
the
men
among
whom
the
codes
are
maintained
several
instances
of
this
have
already
been
noticed
and
the
general
fact
which
has
been
much
dwelt
upon
by
utilitarian
writers
is
also
admitted
and
even
emphasised
by
their
opponents
thus
dugald
stewart
lays
stress
on
the
extent
to
which
the
moral
judgments
of
mankind
have
been
modified
by
the
diversity
in
their
physical
circumstances
the
unequal
degrees
of
civilisation
which
they
have
attained
and
their
unequal
measures
of
knowledge
or
of
he
points
out
for
instance
that
theft
is
regarded
as
a
very
venial
offence
in
the
south
sea
islanders
because
little
or
no
labour
is
there
required
to
support
life
that
the
lending
of
money
for
interest
is
commonly
reprehended
in
societies
where
commerce
is
imperfectly
developed
because
the
usurer
in
such
communities
is
commonly
in
the
odious
position
of
wringing
a
gain
out
of
the
hard
necessities
of
his
fellows
and
that
where
the
legal
arrangements
for
punishing
crime
are
imperfect
private
murder
is
either
justified
or
regarded
very
leniently
many
other
examples
might
be
added
to
these
if
it
were
needful
but
i
conceive
that
few
persons
who
have
studied
the
subject
will
deny
that
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
correlation
between
the
variations
in
the
moral
code
from
age
to
age
and
the
variations
in
the
real
or
perceived
effects
on
general
happiness
of
actions
prescribed
or
forbidden
by
the
code
and
in
proportion
as
the
apprehension
of
consequences
becomes
more
comprehensive
and
exact
we
may
trace
not
only
change
in
the
moral
code
handed
down
from
age
to
age
but
progress
in
the
direction
of
a
closer
approximation
to
a
perfectly
enlightened
utilitarianism
only
we
must
distinctly
notice
another
important
factor
in
the
progress
which
stewart
has
not
mentioned
the
extension
namely
of
the
capacity
for
sympathy
in
an
average
member
of
the
community
the
imperfection
of
earlier
moral
codes
is
at
least
as
much
due
to
defectiveness
of
sympathy
as
of
intelligence
often
no
doubt
the
ruder
man
did
not
perceive
the
effects
of
his
conduct
on
others
but
often
again
he
perceived
them
more
or
less
but
felt
little
or
no
concern
about
them
thus
it
happens
that
changes
in
the
conscience
of
a
community
often
correspond
to
changes
in
the
extent
and
degree
of
the
sensitiveness
of
an
average
member
of
it
to
the
feelings
of
others
of
this
the
moral
development
historically
worked
out
under
the
influence
of
christianity
affords
familiar
illustrations
i
am
not
maintaining
that
this
correlation
between
the
development
of
current
morality
and
the
changes
in
the
consequences
of
conduct
as
sympathetically
forecast
is
perfect
and
exact
on
the
contrary
as
i
shall
have
occasion
to
point
out
in
the
next
chapter
the
history
of
morality
shows
us
many
evidences
of
what
from
the
utilitarian
point
of
view
appear
to
be
partial
aberrations
of
the
moral
sense
but
even
in
these
instances
we
can
often
discover
a
germ
of
unconscious
utilitarianism
the
aberration
is
often
only
an
exaggeration
of
an
obviously
useful
sentiment
or
the
extension
of
it
by
mistaken
analogy
to
cases
to
which
it
does
not
properly
apply
or
perhaps
the
survival
of
a
sentiment
which
once
was
useful
but
has
now
ceased
to
be
so
further
it
must
be
observed
that
i
have
carefully
abstained
from
asserting
that
the
perception
of
the
rightness
of
any
kind
of
conduct
has
always
or
even
ordinarily
been
derived
by
conscious
inference
from
a
perception
of
consequent
advantages
this
hypothesis
is
naturally
suggested
by
such
a
survey
as
the
preceding
but
the
evidence
of
history
hardly
seems
to
me
to
support
it
since
as
we
retrace
the
development
of
ethical
thought
the
utilitarian
basis
of
current
morality
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
exhibit
in
the
present
chapter
seems
to
be
rather
less
than
more
distinctly
apprehended
by
the
common
moral
consciousness
thus
aristotle
sees
that
the
sphere
of
the
virtue
of
courage
ἀνδρεία
as
recognised
by
the
common
sense
of
greece
is
restricted
to
dangers
in
war
and
we
can
now
explain
this
limitation
by
a
reference
to
the
utilitarian
importance
of
this
kind
of
courage
at
a
period
of
history
when
the
individual
s
happiness
was
bound
up
more
completely
than
it
now
is
with
the
welfare
of
his
state
while
the
very
existence
of
the
latter
was
more
frequently
imperilled
by
hostile
invasions
but
this
explanation
lies
quite
beyond
the
range
of
aristotle
s
own
reflection
the
origin
of
our
moral
notions
and
sentiments
lies
hid
in
those
obscure
regions
of
hypothetical
history
where
conjecture
has
free
scope
but
we
do
not
find
that
as
our
retrospect
approaches
the
borders
of
this
realm
the
conscious
connexion
in
men
s
minds
between
accepted
moral
rules
and
foreseen
effects
on
general
happiness
becomes
more
clearly
traceable
the
admiration
felt
by
early
man
for
beauties
or
excellences
of
character
seems
to
have
been
as
direct
and
unreflective
as
his
admiration
of
any
other
beauty
and
the
stringency
of
law
and
custom
in
primitive
times
presents
itself
as
sanctioned
by
the
evils
which
divine
displeasure
will
supernaturally
inflict
on
their
violators
rather
than
by
even
a
rude
and
vague
forecast
of
the
natural
bad
consequences
of
it
is
therefore
not
as
the
mode
of
regulating
conduct
with
which
mankind
began
but
rather
as
that
to
which
we
can
now
see
that
human
development
has
been
always
tending
as
the
adult
and
not
the
germinal
form
of
morality
that
utilitarianism
may
most
reasonably
claim
the
acceptance
of
common
sense
if
we
consider
the
relation
of
ethics
to
politics
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
the
question
what
rules
of
conduct
for
the
governed
should
be
fixed
by
legislators
and
applied
by
judges
will
be
determined
by
the
same
kind
of
forecast
of
consequences
as
will
be
used
in
settling
all
questions
of
private
morality
we
shall
endeavour
to
estimate
and
balance
against
each
other
the
effects
of
such
rules
on
the
general
happiness
in
so
far
however
as
we
divide
the
utilitarian
theory
of
private
conduct
from
that
of
legislation
and
ask
which
is
prior
the
answer
would
seem
to
be
different
in
respect
of
different
parts
of
the
legal
code
to
a
great
extent
the
rules
laid
down
in
a
utilitarian
code
of
law
will
be
such
as
any
man
sincerely
desirous
of
promoting
the
general
happiness
would
generally
endeavour
to
observe
even
if
they
were
not
legally
binding
of
this
kind
is
the
rule
of
not
inflicting
any
bodily
harm
or
gratuitous
annoyance
on
any
one
except
in
or
as
retribution
for
wrong
the
rule
of
not
interfering
with
another
s
pursuit
of
the
means
of
happiness
or
with
his
enjoyment
of
wealth
acquired
by
his
own
labour
or
the
free
consent
of
others
the
rule
of
fulfilling
all
engagements
freely
entered
into
with
any
one
at
any
rate
unless
the
fulfilment
were
harmful
to
others
or
much
more
harmful
to
oneself
than
beneficial
to
him
or
unless
there
were
good
grounds
for
supposing
that
the
other
party
would
not
perform
his
share
of
a
bilateral
contract
and
the
rule
of
supporting
one
s
children
while
helpless
and
one
s
parents
if
decrepit
and
of
educating
one
s
children
suitably
to
their
future
life
as
regards
such
rules
as
these
utilitarian
ethics
seems
independent
of
politics
and
naturally
prior
to
it
we
first
consider
what
conduct
is
right
for
private
individuals
and
then
to
how
much
of
this
they
can
advantageously
be
compelled
by
legal
penalties
there
are
other
rules
again
which
it
is
clearly
for
the
general
happiness
to
observe
if
only
their
observance
is
enforced
on
others
abstinence
from
personal
retaliation
of
injuries
and
a
more
general
and
unhesitating
fulfilment
of
contracts
than
would
perhaps
be
expedient
if
they
were
not
legally
enforced
but
again
in
the
complete
determination
of
the
mutual
claims
of
members
of
society
to
services
and
forbearances
there
are
many
points
on
which
the
utilitarian
theory
of
right
private
conduct
apart
from
law
would
lead
to
a
considerable
variety
of
conclusions
from
the
great
difference
in
the
force
of
the
relevant
considerations
under
different
circumstances
while
at
the
same
time
uniformity
is
either
indispensable
to
prevent
disputes
and
disappointments
or
at
least
highly
desirable
in
order
to
maintain
effectively
such
rules
of
conduct
as
are
though
not
expedient
under
this
head
would
come
the
exacter
definition
of
the
limits
of
appropriation
as
regards
property
in
literary
compositions
and
technical
inventions
and
a
large
part
of
the
law
of
inheritance
and
of
the
law
regulating
the
family
relations
in
such
cases
in
so
far
as
they
are
capable
of
being
theoretically
determined
utilitarian
ethics
seems
to
blend
with
utilitarian
politics
in
a
rather
complicated
way
since
we
can
not
determine
the
right
conduct
for
a
private
individual
in
any
particular
case
without
first
considering
what
rule
if
any
it
would
be
on
the
whole
expedient
to
maintain
in
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
by
legal
penalties
as
well
as
by
the
weaker
and
less
definite
sanctions
of
moral
opinion
this
problem
moreover
in
any
concrete
case
is
necessarily
further
complicated
by
the
consideration
of
the
delicate
mutual
relations
of
positive
law
and
positive
morality
as
we
may
call
the
actual
moral
opinions
generally
held
in
a
given
society
at
a
given
time
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
dangerous
in
legislation
to
advance
beyond
positive
morality
by
prohibiting
actions
or
inactions
that
are
generally
approved
or
tolerated
on
the
other
hand
up
to
the
point
at
which
this
danger
becomes
serious
legislation
is
a
most
effective
instrument
for
modifying
or
intensifying
public
opinion
in
the
direction
in
which
it
is
desirable
that
it
should
progress
leaving
this
difficult
question
of
social
dynamics
we
may
say
that
normally
in
a
society
the
most
important
and
indispensable
rules
of
social
behaviour
will
be
legally
enforced
and
the
less
important
left
to
be
maintained
by
positive
morality
law
will
constitute
as
it
were
the
skeleton
of
social
order
clothed
upon
by
the
flesh
and
blood
of
morality
footnotes
it
ought
to
be
observed
that
cumberland
does
not
adopt
a
hedonistic
interpretation
of
good
still
i
have
followed
hallam
in
regarding
him
as
the
founder
of
english
utilitarianism
since
it
seems
to
have
been
by
a
gradual
and
process
that
good
came
to
have
the
definitely
hedonistic
meaning
which
it
has
implicitly
in
shaftesbury
s
system
and
explicitly
in
that
of
hume
i
should
point
out
that
hume
uses
utility
in
a
narrower
sense
than
that
which
bentham
gave
it
and
one
more
in
accordance
with
the
usage
of
ordinary
language
he
distinguishes
the
useful
from
the
immediately
agreeable
so
that
while
recognising
utility
as
the
main
ground
of
our
moral
approbation
of
the
more
important
virtues
he
holds
that
there
are
other
elements
of
personal
merit
which
we
approve
because
they
are
immediately
agreeable
either
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
or
to
others
it
appears
however
more
convenient
to
use
the
word
in
the
wider
sense
in
which
it
has
been
current
since
bentham

it

cf

strictly
speaking

the

the

is

further

the

of
dealing

have
before
observed
that
it
is
quite
in

with

principles
to
recognise
a
sphere
of
private
conduct
within
which
each
individual
may
distribute
his
wealth
and
kind
services
as
unequally
as
he
chooses
without
incurring
censure
as
unjust
it
is
obvious
that
so
long
as
the
social
sanction
is
enforced
the
lives
of
the
women
against
whom
society
thus
issues
its
ban
must
tend
to
be
unhappy
from
disorder
and
shame
and
the
source
of
unhappiness
to
others
and
also
that
the
breach
by
men
of
a
recognised
and
necessary
moral
rule
must
tend
to
have
injurious
effects
on
their
moral
habits

among

changes
in
the

of

which
are
to
be
attributed
mainly
if
not
entirely
to
the
extension
and
intensification
of
sympathy
due
to
christianity
the
following
may
be
especially
noted
the
severe
condemnation
and
final
suppression
of
the
practice
of
exposing
infants
effective
abhorrence
of
the
barbarism
of
gladiatorial
combats
immediate

and
a
strong
encouragement
of

great
extension
of
the
eleemosynary
provision
made
for
the
sick
and
poor
this
passage
which
in
the
second
and
subsequent
editions
occurred
in
chap
ii
of
book
was
omitted
by
professor
sidgwick
from
that
chapter
in
the
sixth
edition
with
the
intention
of
incorporating
it
in
book
which
he
did
not
live
to
revise
chapter
iv
the
method
of
utilitarianism
if
the
view
maintained
in
the
preceding
chapter
as
to
the
general
utilitarian
basis
of
the
morality
of
common
sense
may
be
regarded
as
sufficiently
established
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
consider
more
closely
to
what
method
of
determining
right
conduct
the
acceptance
of
utilitarianism
will
practically
lead
the
most
obvious
method
of
course
is
that
of
empirical
hedonism
discussed
in
book
ii
chap
iii
according
to
which
we
have
in
each
case
to
compare
all
the
pleasures
and
pains
that
can
be
foreseen
as
probable
results
of
the
different
alternatives
of
conduct
presented
to
us
and
to
adopt
the
alternative
which
seems
likely
to
lead
to
the
greatest
happiness
on
the
whole
in
book
however
it
appeared
that
even
the
more
restricted
application
of
this
method
which
we
there
had
to
consider
was
involved
in
much
perplexity
and
uncertainty
even
when
an
individual
is
only
occupied
in
forecasting
his
own
pleasures
it
seems
difficult
or
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
errors
of
considerable
magnitude
whether
in
accurately
comparing
the
pleasantness
of
his
own
past
feelings
as
represented
in
memory
or
in
appropriating
the
experience
of
others
or
in
arguing
from
the
past
to
the
future
and
these
difficulties
are
obviously
much
increased
when
we
have
to
take
into
account
all
the
effects
of
our
actions
on
all
the
sentient
beings
who
may
be
affected
by
them
at
the
same
time
in
book
ii
we
could
not
find
any
satisfactory
substitute
for
this
method
of
empirical
comparison
it
did
not
appear
reasonable
to
take
refuge
in
the
uncriticised
beliefs
of
men
in
general
as
to
the
sources
of
happiness
indeed
it
seemed
impossible
to
extract
any
adequately
clear
and
definite
of
opinion
from
the
confused
and
varying
utterances
of
common
sense
on
this
subject
nor
again
could
it
be
shown
that
the
individual
would
be
more
likely
to
attain
the
greatest
happiness
open
to
him
by
practically
confining
his
efforts
to
the
realisation
of
any
scientifically
ascertainable
physical
or
psychical
conditions
of
happiness
nor
did
it
seem
possible
to
infer
on
empirical
grounds
that
the
desired
result
would
be
secured
by
conformity
to
the
accepted
principles
of
morality
but
when
we
consider
these
latter
in
relation
not
to
the
happiness
of
the
individual
but
to
that
of
human
or
sentient
beings
generally
it
is
clear
from
the
preceding
chapter
that
the
question
of
harmony
between
hedonism
and
intuitionism
presents
an
entirely
different
aspect
indeed
from
the
considerations
that
we
have
just
surveyed
it
is
but
a
short
and
easy
step
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
morality
of
common
sense
we
have
ready
to
hand
a
body
of
utilitarian
doctrine
that
the
rules
of
morality
for
the
multitude
are
to
be
regarded
as
positive
beliefs
of
mankind
as
to
the
effects
of
actions
on
their
happiness
so
that
the
apparent
first
principles
of
common
sense
may
be
accepted
as
the
middle
axioms
of
utilitarian
method
direct
reference
being
only
made
to
utilitarian
considerations
in
order
to
settle
points
upon
which
the
verdict
of
common
sense
is
found
to
be
obscure
and
conflicting
on
this
view
the
traditional
controversy
between
the
advocates
of
virtue
and
the
advocates
of
happiness
would
seem
to
be
at
length
harmoniously
settled
and
the
arguments
for
this
view
which
have
been
already
put
forward
certainly
receive
support
from
the
hypothesis
now
widely
accepted
that
the
moral
sentiments
are
ultimately
derived
by
a
complex
and
gradual
process
from
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
the
hypothesis
in
a
summary
form
would
seem
to
be
this
in
the
experience
of
each
member
of
the
human
community
the
pain
or
alarm
caused
to
him
by
actions
of
himself
and
of
others
tends
by
association
to
excite
in
him
a
dislike
of
such
actions
and
a
similar
though
feebler
effect
is
produced
by
his
perception
of
pain
or
danger
caused
to
others
with
whom
he
is
connected
by
blood
or
by
community
of
interest
or
any
special
tie
of
sympathy
experience
also
tends
more
indirectly
to
produce
in
him
sentiments
restraining
him
from
actions
painful
or
alarming
to
others
through
his
dread
of
their
resentment
and
its
consequences
especially
dread
of
his
chief
s
anger
and
where
religious
influence
has
become
strong
of
the
anger
of
supernatural
beings
with
these
latter
feelings
blends
a
sympathetic
aversion
to
the
pain
of
other
men
generally
which
at
first
comparatively
feeble
tends
to
grow
in
force
as
morality
develops
in
the
same
way
experiences
of
pleasure
and
gratitude
and
desire
of
the
goodwill
of
others
and
its
consequences
tend
to
produce
liking
for
actions
that
are
perceived
to
cause
pleasure
to
self
or
to
others
the
similar
aversions
and
likings
that
are
thus
produced
in
the
majority
of
the
members
of
any
society
through
the
general
similarity
of
their
natures
and
conditions
tend
to
become
more
similar
through
communication
and
imitation
the
desire
of
each
to
retain
the
goodwill
of
others
operating
to
repress
individual
divergencies
thus
common
likings
for
conduct
that
affects
pleasurably
the
community
generally
or
some
part
of
it
and
common
dislikes
for
conduct
causing
pain
and
alarm
come
to
be
gradually
developed
they
are
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
partly
perhaps
by
physical
inheritance
but
chiefly
by
tradition
from
parents
to
children
and
imitation
of
adults
by
the
young
in
this
way
their
origin
becomes
obscured
and
they
finally
appear
as
what
are
called
the
moral
sentiments
this
theory
does
not
in
my
view
account
adequately
for
the
actual
results
of
the
faculty
of
moral
judgment
and
reasoning
so
far
as
i
can
examine
them
by
reflection
on
my
own
moral
consciousness
for
this
as
i
have
before
said
does
not
yield
any
apparent
intuitions
that
stand
the
test
of
rigorous
examination
except
such
as
from
their
abstract
and
general
character
have
no
cognisable
relation
to
particular
experiences
of
any
kind
but
that
the
theory
gives
a
partially
true
explanation
of
the
historical
origin
of
particular
moral
sentiments
and
habits
and
commonly
accepted
rules
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
and
thus
regarded
it
seems
to
supplement
the
arguments
of
the
preceding
chapter
that
tend
to
exhibit
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
unconsciously
or
instinctively
utilitarian
but
it
is
one
thing
to
hold
that
the
current
morality
expresses
partly
consciously
but
to
a
larger
extent
unconsciously
the
results
of
human
experience
as
to
the
effects
of
actions
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
accept
this
morality
so
far
as
it
is
clear
and
definite
as
the
best
guidance
we
can
get
to
the
attainment
of
maximum
general
happiness
however
attractive
this
simple
reconciliation
of
intuitional
and
utilitarian
methods
may
be
it
is
not
i
think
really
warranted
by
the
evidence
in
the
first
place
i
hold
that
in
a
complete
view
of
the
development
of
the
moral
sense
a
more
prominent
place
should
be
given
to
the
effect
of
sympathy
with
the
impulses
that
prompt
to
actions
as
well
as
with
the
feelings
that
result
from
them
it
may
be
observed
that
adam
smith
assigns
to
this
operation
of
sympathy
the
echo
as
it
were
of
each
agent
s
passion
in
the
breast
of
unconcerned
spectators
the
first
place
in
determining
our
approval
and
disapproval
of
actions
sympathy
with
the
effect
of
conduct
on
others
he
treats
as
a
merely
secondary
factor
correcting
and
qualifying
the
former
without
going
so
far
as
this
i
think
that
there
are
certainly
many
cases
where
the
resulting
moral
consciousness
would
seem
to
indicate
a
balance
or
compromise
between
the
two
kinds
of
sympathy
and
the
compromise
may
easily
be
many
degrees
removed
from
the
rule
which
utilitarianism
would
prescribe
for
though
the
passions
and
other
active
impulses
are
doubtless
themselves
influenced
no
less
than
the
moral
sentiments
by
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
still
this
influence
is
not
sufficient
to
make
them
at
all
trustworthy
guides
to
general
any
more
than
to
individual
happiness
as
some
of
our
moral
sentiments
themselves
emphatically
announce
but
even
if
we
consider
our
common
moral
sentiments
as
entirely
due
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
accumulated
and
transmitted
experiences
of
primary
and
sympathetic
pains
and
pleasures
it
is
obvious
that
the
degree
of
accuracy
with
which
sentiments
thus
produced
will
guide
us
to
the
promotion
of
general
happiness
must
largely
depend
upon
the
degree
of
accuracy
with
which
the
whole
sum
of
pleasurable
and
painful
consequences
resulting
from
any
course
of
action
has
been
represented
in
the
consciousness
of
an
average
member
of
the
community
and
it
is
seen
at
a
glance
that
this
representation
has
always
been
liable
to
errors
of
great
magnitude
from
causes
that
were
partly
noticed
in
the
previous
chapter
when
we
were
considering
the
progress
of
morality
we
have
to
allow
first
for
limitation
of
sympathy
since
in
every
age
and
country
the
sympathy
of
an
average
man
with
other
sentient
beings
and
even
his
egoistic
regard
for
their
likings
and
aversions
has
been
much
more
limited
than
the
influence
of
his
actions
on
the
feelings
of
others
we
must
allow
further
for
limitation
of
intelligence
for
in
all
ages
ordinary
men
have
had
a
very
inadequate
knowledge
of
natural
sequences
so
that
such
indirect
consequences
of
conduct
as
have
been
felt
have
been
frequently
traced
to
wrong
causes
and
been
met
by
wrong
moral
remedies
owing
to
imperfect
apprehension
of
the
relation
of
means
to
ends
again
where
the
habit
of
obedience
to
authority
and
respect
for
rank
has
become
strong
we
must
allow
for
the
possibly
perverting
influence
of
a
desire
to
win
the
favour
or
avert
the
anger
of
superiors
and
similarly
we
must
allow
again
for
the
influences
of
false
religions
and
also
for
the
possibility
that
the
sensibilities
of
religious
teachers
have
influenced
the
code
of
duty
accepted
by
their
followers
in
points
where
these
sensibilities
were
not
normal
and
representative
but
exceptional
and
idiosyncratic
on
the
other
hand
we
must
suppose
that
these
deflecting
influences
have
been
more
or
less
limited
and
counteracted
by
the
struggle
for
existence
in
past
ages
among
different
human
races
and
communities
since
so
far
as
any
moral
habit
or
sentiment
was
unfavourable
to
the
preservation
of
the
social
organism
it
would
be
a
disadvantage
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
would
therefore
tend
to
perish
with
the
community
that
adhered
to
it
but
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
this
force
would
be
adequate
to
keep
positive
morality
always
in
conformity
with
a
utilitarian
ideal
for
imperfect
morality
would
be
only
one
disadvantage
among
many
and
not
i
conceive
the
most
important
unless
the
imperfection
were
extreme
especially
in
the
earlier
stages
of
social
and
moral
development
in
which
the
struggle
for
existence
was
most
operative
and
a
morality
perfectly
preservative
of
a
human
community
might
still
be
imperfectly
felicific
and
so
require
considerable
improvement
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
further
analogy
would
lead
us
to
expect
that
however
completely
adapted
the
moral
instincts
of
a
community
may
be
at
some
particular
time
to
its
conditions
of
existence
any
rapid
change
of
circumstances
would
tend
to
derange
the
adaptation
from
survival
of
instincts
formerly
useful
which
through
this
change
become
useless
or
pernicious
and
indeed
apart
from
any
apparent
changes
in
external
circumstances
it
might
result
from
the
operation
of
some
law
of
human
development
that
the
most
completely
organised
experience
of
human
happiness
in
the
past
would
guide
us
but
imperfectly
to
the
right
means
of
making
it
a
maximum
in
the
future
for
example
a
slight
decrease
in
the
average
strength
of
some
common
impulse
might
render
the
traditional
rules
and
sentiments
that
regulate
this
impulse
infelicific
on
the
whole
and
if
when
we
turn
from
these
abstract
considerations
to
history
and
examine
the
actual
morality
of
other
ages
and
countries
we
undoubtedly
find
that
considered
as
an
instrument
for
producing
general
happiness
it
continually
seems
to
exhibit
palpable
imperfections
there
is
surely
a
strong
presumption
that
there
are
similar
imperfections
to
be
discovered
in
our
own
moral
code
though
habit
and
familiarity
prevent
them
from
being
obvious
finally
we
must
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
divergences
which
we
find
when
we
compare
the
moralities
of
different
ages
and
countries
exist
to
some
extent
side
by
side
in
the
morality
of
any
one
society
at
any
given
time
it
has
already
been
observed
that
whenever
divergent
opinions
are
entertained
by
a
minority
so
large
that
we
can
not
fairly
regard
the
dogma
of
the
majority
as
the
plain
utterance
of
common
sense
an
appeal
is
necessarily
made
to
some
higher
principle
and
very
commonly
to
utilitarianism
but
a
smaller
minority
than
this
particularly
if
composed
of
persons
of
enlightenment
and
special
acquaintance
with
the
effects
of
the
conduct
judged
may
reasonably
inspire
us
with
distrust
of
common
sense
just
as
in
the
more
technical
parts
of
practice
we
prefer
the
judgment
of
a
few
trained
experts
to
the
instincts
of
the
vulgar
yet
again
a
contemplation
of
these
divergent
codes
and
their
relation
to
the
different
circumstances
in
which
men
live
suggests
that
morality
is
really
only
adapted
for
ordinary
men
in
ordinary
circumstances
although
it
may
still
be
expedient
that
these
ordinary
persons
should
regard
it
as
absolutely
and
universally
prescribed
since
any
other
view
of
it
may
dangerously
weaken
its
hold
over
their
minds
so
far
as
this
is
the
case
we
must
use
the
utilitarian
method
to
ascertain
how
far
persons
in
special
circumstances
require
a
morality
more
specially
adapted
to
them
than
common
sense
is
willing
to
concede
and
also
how
far
men
of
peculiar
physical
or
mental
constitution
ought
to
be
exempted
from
ordinary
rules
as
has
sometimes
been
claimed
for
men
of
genius
or
men
of
intensely
emotional
nature
or
men
gifted
with
more
than
usual
prudence
and
further
it
is
important
to
notice
that
besides
the
large
amount
of
divergence
that
exists
between
the
moral
instincts
of
different
classes
and
individuals
there
is
often
a
palpable
discrepancy
between
the
moral
instincts
of
any
class
or
individual
and
such
utilitarian
reasonings
as
their
untrained
intellects
are
in
the
habit
of
conducting
there
are
many
things
in
conduct
which
many
people
think
right
but
not
expedient
or
at
least
which
they
would
not
think
expedient
if
they
had
not
first
judged
them
to
be
right
in
so
far
as
they
reason
from
experience
only
their
conclusions
as
to
what
conduces
to
the
general
happiness
are
opposed
to
their
moral
intuitions
it
may
be
said
that
this
results
generally
from
a
hasty
and
superficial
consideration
of
expediency
and
that
the
discrepancy
would
disappear
after
a
deeper
and
completer
examination
of
the
consequences
of
actions
and
i
do
not
deny
that
this
would
often
turn
out
to
be
the
case
but
as
we
can
not
tell
how
far
it
would
be
so
this
only
constitutes
a
further
argument
for
a
comprehensive
and
systematic
application
of
a
purely
utilitarian
method
we
must
conclude
then
that
we
can
not
take
the
moral
rules
of
common
sense
as
expressing
the
of
competent
judges
up
to
the
present
time
as
to
the
kind
of
conduct
which
is
likely
to
produce
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
on
the
whole
it
would
rather
seem
that
it
is
the
unavoidable
duty
of
a
systematic
utilitarianism
to
make
a
thorough
revision
of
these
rules
in
order
to
ascertain
how
far
the
causes
previously
enumerated
and
perhaps
others
have
actually
operated
to
produce
a
divergence
between
common
sense
and
a
perfectly
utilitarian
code
of
morality
but
in
thus
stating
the
problem
we
are
assuming
that
the
latter
term
of
this
comparison
can
be
satisfactorily
defined
and
sufficiently
developed
that
we
can
frame
with
adequate
precision
a
system
of
rules
constituting
the
true
moral
code
for
human
beings
as
deduced
from
utilitarian
principles
and
this
seems
to
have
been
commonly
assumed
by
the
school
whose
method
we
are
now
examining
but
when
we
set
ourselves
in
earnest
to
the
construction
of
such
a
system
we
find
it
beset
with
serious
difficulties
for
passing
over
the
uncertainties
involved
in
hedonistic
comparison
generally
let
us
suppose
that
the
of
happiness
that
will
result
from
the
establishment
of
any
plan
of
behaviour
among
human
beings
can
be
ascertained
with
sufficient
exactness
for
practical
purposes
even
when
the
plan
is
as
yet
constructed
in
imagination
alone
it
still
has
to
be
asked
what
is
the
nature
of
the
human
being
for
whom
we
are
to
construct
this
hypothetical
scheme
of
conduct
for
humanity
is
not
something
that
exhibits
the
same
properties
always
and
everywhere
whether
we
consider
the
intellect
of
man
or
his
feelings
or
his
physical
condition
and
circumstances
we
find
them
so
different
in
different
ages
and
countries
that
it
seems
absurd
to
lay
down
a
set
of
ideal
utilitarian
rules
for
mankind
generally
it
may
be
said
that
these
differences
after
all
relate
chiefly
to
details
and
that
there
is
in
any
case
sufficient
uniformity
in
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
human
life
always
and
everywhere
to
render
possible
an
outline
scheme
of
ideal
behaviour
for
mankind
at
large
but
it
must
be
answered
that
it
is
with
details
that
we
are
now
principally
concerned
for
the
previous
discussion
has
sufficiently
shown
that
the
conduct
approved
by
common
sense
has
a
resemblance
to
that
which
utilitarianism
would
prescribe
but
we
wish
to
ascertain
more
exactly
how
far
the
resemblance
extends
and
with
what
delicacy
and
precision
the
current
moral
rules
are
adapted
to
the
actual
needs
and
conditions
of
human
life
suppose
then
that
we
contract
the
scope
of
investigation
and
only
endeavour
to
ascertain
the
rules
appropriate
to
men
as
we
know
them
in
our
own
age
and
country
we
are
immediately
met
with
a
dilemma
the
men
whom
we
know
are
beings
who
accept
more
or
less
definitely
a
certain
moral
code
if
we
take
them
as
they
are
in
this
respect
we
can
hardly
at
the
same
time
conceive
them
as
beings
for
whom
a
code
is
yet
to
be
constructed
if
on
the
other
hand
we
take
an
actual
man
let
us
say
an
average
englishman
and
abstract
his
morality
what
remains
is
an
entity
so
purely
hypothetical
that
it
is
not
clear
what
practical
purpose
can
be
served
by
constructing
a
system
of
moral
rules
for
the
community
of
such
beings
could
we
indeed
assume
that
the
scientific
deduction
of
such
a
system
would
ensure
its
general
acceptance
could
we
reasonably
expect
to
convert
all
mankind
at
once
to
utilitarian
principles
or
even
all
educated
and
reflective
mankind
so
that
all
preachers
and
teachers
should
take
universal
happiness
as
the
goal
of
their
efforts
as
unquestioningly
as
physicians
take
the
health
of
the
individual
body
and
could
we
be
sure
that
men
s
moral
habits
and
sentiments
would
adjust
themselves
at
once
and
without
any
waste
of
force
to
these
changed
rules
then
perhaps
in
framing
the
utilitarian
code
we
might
fairly
leave
existing
morality
out
of
account
but
i
can
not
think
that
we
are
warranted
in
making
these
suppositions
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
moral
habits
impulses
and
tastes
of
men
as
a
material
given
us
to
work
upon
no
less
than
the
rest
of
their
nature
and
as
something
which
as
it
only
partly
results
from
reasoning
in
the
past
so
can
only
be
partially
modified
by
any
reasoning
which
we
can
now
apply
to
it
it
seems
therefore
clear
that
the
solution
of
the
hypothetical
utilitarian
problem
of
constructing
an
ideal
morality
for
men
conceived
to
be
in
other
respects
as
experience
shows
them
to
be
but
with
their
actual
morality
abstracted
will
not
give
us
the
result
which
we
practically
require
it
will
perhaps
be
said
no
doubt
such
an
ideal
utilitarian
morality
can
only
be
gradually
and
perhaps
after
all
imperfectly
introduced
but
still
it
will
be
useful
to
work
it
out
as
a
pattern
to
which
we
may
but
in
the
first
place
it
may
not
be
really
possible
to
approximate
to
it
since
any
particular
existing
moral
rule
though
not
the
ideally
best
even
for
such
beings
as
existing
men
under
the
existing
circumstances
may
yet
be
the
best
that
they
can
be
got
to
obey
so
that
it
would
be
futile
to
propose
any
other
or
even
harmful
as
it
might
tend
to
impair
old
moral
habits
without
effectively
replacing
them
by
new
ones
and
secondly
the
endeavour
gradually
to
approximate
to
a
morality
constructed
on
the
supposition
that
the
part
of
existing
human
nature
remains
unchanged
may
lead
us
wrong
because
the
state
of
men
s
knowledge
and
intellectual
faculties
and
the
range
of
their
sympathies
and
the
direction
and
strength
of
their
prevailing
impulses
and
their
relations
to
the
external
world
and
to
each
other
are
continually
being
altered
and
such
alteration
is
to
some
extent
under
our
control
and
may
be
felicific
in
a
high
degree
and
any
material
modifications
in
important
elements
and
conditions
of
human
life
may
require
corresponding
changes
in
established
moral
rules
and
sentiments
in
order
that
the
greatest
possible
happiness
may
be
attained
by
the
human
being
whose
life
is
thus
modified
in
short
the
construction
of
a
utilitarian
code
regarded
as
an
ideal
towards
which
we
are
to
progress
is
met
by
a
second
dilemma
the
nature
of
man
and
the
conditions
of
his
life
can
not
usefully
be
assumed
to
be
constant
unless
we
are
confining
our
attention
to
the
present
or
proximate
future
while
again
if
we
are
considering
them
in
the
present
or
proximate
future
we
must
take
into
account
men
s
actual
moral
habits
and
sentiments
as
a
part
of
their
nature
not
materially
more
modifiable
than
the
rest
nor
again
can
i
agree
with
spencer
in
thinking
that
it
is
possible
to
solve
the
problems
of
practical
ethics
by
constructing
the
final
perfect
form
of
society
towards
which
the
process
of
human
history
is
tending
and
determining
the
rules
of
mutual
behaviour
which
ought
to
be
and
will
be
observed
by
the
members
of
this
perfect
society
for
firstly
granting
that
we
can
conceive
as
possible
a
human
community
which
is
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
perfect
and
granting
also
spencer
s
definition
of
this
perfection
viz
that
the
voluntary
actions
of
all
the
members
cause
pleasure
unalloyed
by
pain
anywhere
to
all
who
are
affected
by
them
it
still
seems
to
me
quite
impossible
to
forecast
the
natures
and
relations
of
the
persons
composing
such
a
community
with
sufficient
clearness
and
certainty
to
enable
us
to
define
even
in
outline
their
moral
code
and
secondly
even
if
it
were
otherwise
even
if
we
could
construct
scientifically
spencer
s
ideal
morality
i
do
not
think
such
a
construction
would
be
of
much
avail
in
solving
the
practical
problems
of
actual
humanity
for
a
society
in
which
to
take
one
point
only
there
is
no
such
thing
as
punishment
is
necessarily
a
society
with
its
essential
structure
so
unlike
our
own
that
it
would
be
idle
to
attempt
any
close
imitation
of
its
rules
of
behaviour
it
might
possibly
be
best
for
us
to
conform
approximately
to
some
of
these
rules
but
this
we
could
only
know
by
examining
each
particular
rule
in
detail
we
could
have
no
general
grounds
for
concluding
that
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
conform
to
them
as
far
as
possible
for
even
supposing
that
this
ideal
society
is
ultimately
to
be
realised
it
must
at
any
rate
be
separated
from
us
by
a
considerable
interval
of
evolution
hence
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
best
way
of
progressing
towards
it
will
be
some
other
than
the
apparently
directest
way
and
that
we
shall
reach
it
more
easily
if
we
begin
by
moving
away
from
it
whether
this
is
so
or
not
and
to
what
extent
can
only
be
known
by
carefully
examining
the
effects
of
conduct
on
actual
human
beings
and
inferring
its
probable
effects
on
the
human
beings
whom
we
may
expect
to
exist
in
the
proximate
future
other
thinkers
of
the
evolutionist
school
suggest
that
the
difficulties
of
utilitarian
method
might
be
avoided
in
a
way
more
simple
than
spencer
s
by
adopting
as
the
ultimate
end
and
criterion
of
morality
health
or
efficiency
of
the
social
organism
instead
of
happiness
this
view
is
maintained
for
instance
in
leslie
stephen
s
of
and
deserves
careful
examination
as
i
understand
stephen
he
means
by
health
that
state
of
the
social
organism
which
tends
to
its
preservation
under
the
conditions
of
its
existence
as
they
are
known
or
capable
of
being
predicted
and
he
means
the
same
by
efficiency
since
the
work
for
which
in
his
view
the
social
organism
has
to
be
efficient
is
simply
the
work
of
living
the
function
of
going
i
say
this
because
efficiency
might
be
understood
to
imply
some
task
of
humanity
which
the
social
organism
has
to
execute
beyond
the
task
of
merely
living
and
similarly
health
might
be
taken
to
mean
a
state
tending
to
the
preservation
not
of
existence
merely
but
of
existence
desirability
being
interpreted
in
some
manner
and
in
this
case
an
examination
of
either
term
would
lead
us
again
over
the
ground
traversed
in
the
discussion
on
ultimate
good
in
chap
xiv
of
the
preceding
book
but
i
do
not
understand
that
any
such
implications
were
in
stephen
s
mind
and
they
certainly
would
not
be
in
harmony
with
the
general
drift
of
his
argument
the
question
therefore
is
whether
if
general
happiness
be
admitted
to
be
the
really
ultimate
end
in
a
system
of
morality
it
is
nevertheless
reasonable
to
take
preservation
of
the
social
organism
as
the
practically
ultimate
scientific
criterion
of
moral
rules
my
reasons
for
answering
this
question
in
the
negative
are
in
the
first
place
i
know
no
adequate
grounds
for
supposing
that
if
we
aim
exclusively
at
the
preservation
of
the
social
organism
we
shall
secure
the
maximum
attainable
happiness
of
its
individual
members
indeed
so
far
as
i
know
of
two
social
states
which
equally
tend
to
be
preserved
one
may
be
indefinitely
happier
than
the
other
as
has
been
before
observed
a
large
part
of
the
pleasures
which
cultivated
persons
value
most
highly
æsthetic
pleasures
are
derived
from
acts
and
processes
that
have
no
material
tendency
to
preserve
the
individual
s
life
and
the
statement
remains
true
if
we
substitute
the
social
organism
for
the
individual
and
i
may
add
that
much
refined
morality
is
concerned
with
the
prevention
of
pains
which
have
no
demonstrable
tendency
to
the
destruction
of
the
individual
or
of
society
hence
while
i
quite
admit
that
the
maintenance
of
preservative
habits
and
sentiments
is
the
most
indispensable
function
of
utilitarian
morality
and
perhaps
almost
its
sole
function
in
the
earlier
stages
of
moral
development
when
to
live
at
all
was
a
difficult
task
for
human
communities
i
do
not
therefore
think
it
reasonable
that
we
should
be
content
with
the
mere
securing
of
existence
for
humanity
generally
and
should
confine
our
efforts
to
promoting
the
increase
of
this
security
instead
of
seeking
to
make
the
secured
existence
more
desirable
but
secondly
i
do
not
see
on
what
grounds
stephen
holds
that
the
criterion
of
tendency
to
the
preservation
of
the
social
organism
is
necessarily
capable
of
being
applied
with
greater
precision
than
that
of
tendency
to
general
happiness
even
so
far
as
the
two
ends
are
coincident
and
that
the
former
satisfies
the
conditions
of
a
scientific
i
should
admit
that
this
would
probably
be
the
case
if
the
sociology
that
we
know
were
a
science
actually
constructed
and
not
merely
the
sketch
of
a
possible
future
science
but
stephen
has
himself
told
us
that
sociology
at
present
consists
of
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
unverified
guesses
and
vague
generalisations
disguised
under
a
more
or
less
pretentious
apparatus
of
this
language
is
stronger
than
i
should
have
ventured
to
use
but
i
agree
generally
with
the
view
that
it
expresses
and
it
appears
to
me
difficult
for
a
writer
who
holds
this
view
to
maintain
that
the
conception
of
social
health
regarded
as
a
criterion
and
standard
of
right
conduct
is
in
any
important
degree
more
scientific
than
the
conception
of
general
holding
this
estimate
of
the
present
condition
of
sociology
i
consider
that
from
the
utilitarian
point
of
view
there
are
equally
decisive
reasons
against
the
adoption
of
any
such
notion
as
development
of
the
social
organism
instead
of
mere
preservation
as
the
practically
ultimate
end
and
criterion
of
morality
on
the
one
hand
if
by
development
is
meant
an
increase
in
efficiency
or
preservative
qualities
this
notion
is
only
an
optimistic
specialisation
of
that
just
discussed
involving
the
i
fear
unwarranted
assumption
that
the
social
organism
tends
to
become
continually
more
efficient
so
that
no
fresh
arguments
need
be
urged
against
it
if
however
something
different
is
meant
by
development
as
a
disciple
of
spencer
might
mean
an
increase
in
definite
coherent
heterogeneity
whether
or
not
such
increase
was
preservative
then
i
know
no
scientific
grounds
for
concluding
that
we
shall
best
promote
general
happiness
by
concentrating
our
efforts
on
the
attainment
of
this
increase
i
do
not
affirm
it
to
be
impossible
that
every
increase
in
the
definite
coherent
heterogeneity
of
a
society
of
human
beings
may
be
accompanied
or
followed
by
an
increase
in
the
aggregate
happiness
of
the
members
of
the
society
but
i
do
not
perceive
that
spencer
or
any
one
else
has
even
attempted
to
furnish
the
kind
of
proof
which
this
proposition
requires
to
sum
up
i
hold
that
the
utilitarian
in
the
existing
state
of
our
knowledge
can
not
possibly
construct
a
morality
either
for
man
as
he
is
abstracting
his
morality
or
for
man
as
he
ought
to
be
and
will
be
he
must
start
speaking
broadly
with
the
existing
social
order
and
the
existing
morality
as
a
part
of
that
order
and
in
deciding
the
question
whether
any
divergence
from
this
code
is
to
be
recommended
must
consider
chiefly
the
immediate
consequences
of
such
divergence
upon
a
society
in
which
such
a
code
is
conceived
generally
to
subsist
no
doubt
a
thoughtful
and
utilitarian
may
see
dimly
a
certain
way
ahead
and
his
attitude
towards
existing
morality
may
be
to
some
extent
modified
by
what
he
sees
he
may
discern
in
the
future
certain
evils
impending
which
can
only
be
effectually
warded
off
by
the
adoption
of
new
and
more
stringent
views
of
duty
in
certain
departments
while
on
the
other
hand
he
may
see
a
prospect
of
social
changes
which
will
render
a
relaxation
of
other
parts
of
the
moral
code
expedient
or
inevitable
but
if
he
keeps
within
the
limits
that
separate
scientific
prevision
from
fanciful
utopian
conjecture
the
form
of
society
to
which
his
practical
conclusions
relate
will
be
one
varying
but
little
from
the
actual
with
its
actually
established
code
of
moral
rules
and
customary
judgments
concerning
virtue
and
vice
footnotes
cf
mill
chap
ii
mill
however
only
affirms
that
the
rules
of
morality
for
the
multitude
are
to
be
accepted
by
the
philosopher
provisionally
until
he
has
got
something
better
i
refer
to
the
abstract
principles
of
prudence
justice
and
rational
benevolence
as
defined
in
chap
xiii
of
the
preceding
book
of
moral
book
i
this
operation
of
sympathy
is
strikingly
illustrated
in
the
penal
codes
of
primitive
communities
both
by
the
mildness
of
the
punishments
inflicted
for
homicide
and
by
the
startling
differences
between
the
penalties
allotted
to
the
same
crime
according
as
the
criminal
was
taken
in
the
act
or
not
it
is
curious
to
observe
says
sir
maine
chap
x
how
completely
the
men
of
primitive
times
were
persuaded
that
the
impulses
of
the
injured
person
were
the
proper
measure
of
the
vengeance
he
was
entitled
to
exact
and
how
literally
they
imitated
the
probable
rise
and
fall
of
his
passions
in
fixing
the
scale
of
and
even
in
more
civilised
societies
there
is
a
very
common
feeling
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
propriety
of
inflicting
punishment
for
crimes
committed
long
ago
which
seems
traceable
to
the
same
source
no
doubt
this
influence
is
confined
within
strict
limits
no
authority
can
permanently
impose
on
men
regulations
flagrantly
infelicific
and
the
most
practically
originative
of
religious
teachers
have
produced
their
effect
chiefly
by
giving
new
force
and
vividness
to
sentiments
already
existing
and
recognised
as
properly
authoritive
in
the
society
upon
which
they
acted
still
it
might
have
made
a
great
difference
to
the
human
race
if
mohammed
had
been
fond
of
wine
and
indifferent
to
women
on
this
point
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
further
in
the
next
section
i
refer
especially
to
the
views
put
forward
by
spencer
in
the
concluding
chapters
of
his
of
this
definition
however
does
not
seem
to
me
admissible
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
since
a
society
in
this
sense
perfect
might
not
realise
the
maximum
of
possible
happiness
it
might
still
be
capable
of
a
material
increase
of
happiness
through
pleasures
involving
a
slight
alloy
of
pain
such
as
spencer
s
view
of
perfection
would
exclude
see
especially
chap
ix
pars
it
is
obvious
that
if
desirability
in
the
above
definition
were
interpreted
hedonistically
the
term
health
would
merely
give
us
a
new
name
for
the
general
problem
of
utilitarian
morality
not
a
new
suggestion
for
its
solution
i
ought
to
say
that
the
notions
of
social
welfare
or
wellbeing
are
elsewhere
used
by
stephen
in
the
place
of
those
here
quoted
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
means
by
them
any
more
than
what
i
understand
him
to
mean
by
health
or
efficiency
that
state
of
the
social
organism
which
tends
to
its
preservation
under
the
conditions
of
its
existence
book
ii
chap
vi
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
play
in
some
form
is
not
necessary
for
physical
health
but
there
is
a
long
step
from
the
encouragement
of
play
so
far
as
salutary
to
the
promotion
of
social
culture
it
may
be
observed
that
the
increased
heterogeneity
which
the
development
of
modern
industry
has
brought
with
it
in
the
form
of
a
specialisation
of
industrial
functions
which
tends
to
render
the
lives
of
individual
workers
narrow
and
monotonous
has
usually
been
regarded
by
philanthropists
as
seriously
infelicific
and
as
needing
to
be
counteracted
by
a
general
diffusion
of
the
intellectual
culture
now
enjoyed
by
the
few
which
if
realised
would
tend
to
make
the
lives
of
different
classes
in
the
community
heterogeneous
chapter
v
the
method
of
utilitarianism
if
then
we
are
to
regard
the
morality
of
common
sense
as
a
machinery
of
rules
habits
and
sentiments
roughly
and
generally
but
not
precisely
or
completely
adapted
to
the
production
of
the
greatest
possible
happiness
for
sentient
beings
generally
and
if
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
accept
it
as
the
actually
established
machinery
for
attaining
this
end
which
we
can
not
replace
at
once
by
any
other
but
can
only
gradually
modify
it
remains
to
consider
the
practical
effects
of
the
complex
and
balanced
relation
in
which
a
scientific
utilitarian
thus
seems
to
stand
to
the
positive
morality
of
his
age
and
country
generally
speaking
he
will
clearly
conform
to
it
and
endeavour
to
promote
its
development
in
others
for
though
the
imperfection
that
we
find
in
all
the
actual
conditions
of
human
existence
we
may
even
say
in
the
universe
at
large
as
judged
from
a
human
point
of
view
is
ultimately
found
even
in
morality
itself
in
so
far
as
this
is
contemplated
as
positive
still
practically
we
are
much
less
concerned
with
correcting
and
improving
than
we
are
with
realising
and
enforcing
it
the
utilitarian
must
repudiate
altogether
that
temper
of
rebellion
against
the
established
morality
as
something
purely
external
and
conventional
into
which
the
reflective
mind
is
always
apt
to
fall
when
it
is
first
convinced
that
the
established
rules
are
not
intrinsically
reasonable
he
must
of
course
also
repudiate
as
superstitious
that
awe
of
it
as
an
absolute
or
divine
code
which
intuitional
moralists
inculcate
still
he
will
naturally
contemplate
it
with
reverence
and
wonder
as
a
marvellous
product
of
nature
the
result
of
long
centuries
of
growth
showing
in
many
parts
the
same
fine
adaptation
of
means
to
complex
exigencies
as
the
most
elaborate
structures
of
physical
organisms
exhibit
he
will
handle
it
with
respectful
delicacy
as
a
mechanism
constructed
of
the
fluid
element
of
opinions
and
dispositions
by
the
indispensable
aid
of
which
the
actual
of
human
happiness
is
continually
being
produced
a
mechanism
which
no
politicians
or
philosophers
could
create
yet
without
which
the
harder
and
coarser
machinery
of
positive
law
could
not
be
permanently
maintained
and
the
life
of
man
would
become
as
hobbes
forcibly
expresses
it
solitary
poor
nasty
brutish
and
still
as
this
actual
moral
order
is
admittedly
imperfect
it
will
be
the
utilitarian
s
duty
to
aid
in
improving
it
just
as
the
most
orderly
member
of
a
modern
civilised
society
includes
the
reform
of
laws
in
his
conception
of
political
duty
we
have
therefore
to
consider
by
what
method
he
will
ascertain
the
particular
modifications
of
positive
morality
which
it
would
be
practically
expedient
to
attempt
to
introduce
at
any
given
time
and
place
here
our
investigation
seems
after
all
to
leave
empirical
hedonism
as
the
only
method
ordinarily
applicable
for
the
ultimate
decision
of
such
problems
at
least
until
the
science
of
sociology
shall
have
been
really
constructed
i
do
not
mean
that
the
rudiments
of
sociological
knowledge
which
we
now
possess
are
of
no
practical
value
for
certainly
changes
in
morality
might
be
suggested
and
have
actually
been
proposed
by
persons
seriously
concerned
to
benefit
their
which
even
our
present
imperfect
knowledge
would
lead
us
to
regard
as
dangerous
to
the
very
existence
of
the
social
organism
but
such
changes
for
the
most
part
involve
changes
in
positive
law
as
well
since
most
of
the
rules
of
which
the
observance
is
fundamentally
important
for
the
preservation
of
an
organised
community
are
either
directly
or
indirectly
maintained
by
legal
sanctions
and
it
would
be
going
too
far
beyond
the
line
which
in
my
view
separates
ethics
from
politics
to
discuss
changes
of
this
kind
in
the
present
book
the
rules
with
which
we
have
primarily
to
deal
in
considering
the
utilitarian
method
of
determining
private
duty
are
rules
supported
by
merely
moral
sanctions
and
the
question
of
maintaining
or
modifying
such
rules
concerns
for
the
most
part
the
rather
than
the
very
existence
of
human
society
the
consideration
of
this
question
therefore
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
resolves
itself
into
a
comparison
between
the
total
amounts
of
pleasure
and
pain
that
may
be
expected
to
result
respectively
from
maintaining
any
given
rule
as
at
present
established
and
from
endeavouring
to
introduce
that
which
is
proposed
in
its
stead
that
this
comparison
must
generally
be
of
a
rough
and
uncertain
kind
we
have
already
seen
and
it
is
highly
important
to
bear
this
in
mind
but
yet
we
seem
unable
to
find
any
substitute
for
it
it
is
not
meant
of
course
that
each
individual
is
left
to
his
own
unassisted
judgment
in
dealing
with
such
questions
there
is
a
mass
of
traditional
experience
which
each
individual
imbibes
orally
or
from
books
as
to
the
effects
of
conduct
upon
happiness
but
the
great
formulæ
in
which
this
experience
is
transmitted
are
for
the
most
part
so
indefinite
the
proper
range
of
their
application
so
uncertain
and
the
observation
and
induction
on
which
they
are
founded
so
uncritical
that
they
stand
in
continual
need
of
further
empirical
verification
especially
as
regards
their
applicability
to
any
particular
case
it
is
perhaps
not
surprising
that
some
thinkers
of
the
utilitarian
school
should
consider
that
the
task
of
hedonistic
calculation
which
is
thus
set
before
the
utilitarian
moralist
is
too
extensive
and
should
propose
to
simplify
it
by
marking
off
a
large
sphere
of
individual
option
and
to
which
ethical
dictation
does
not
apply
i
should
quite
admit
that
it
is
clearly
expedient
to
draw
a
dividing
line
of
this
kind
but
it
appears
to
me
that
there
is
no
simple
general
method
of
drawing
it
that
it
can
only
be
drawn
by
careful
utilitarian
calculation
applied
with
varying
results
to
the
various
relations
and
circumstances
of
human
life
to
attempt
the
required
division
by
means
of
any
such
general
formula
as
that
the
individual
is
not
responsible
to
society
for
that
part
of
his
conduct
which
concerns
himself
alone
and
others
only
with
their
free
and
undeceived
consent
seems
to
me
practically
futile
since
owing
to
the
complex
enlacements
of
interest
and
sympathy
that
connect
the
members
of
a
civilised
community
almost
any
material
loss
of
happiness
by
any
one
individual
is
likely
to
affect
some
others
without
their
consent
to
some
not
inconsiderable
extent
and
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
justifiable
to
say
broadly
with
mill
that
such
secondary
injury
to
others
if
merely
constructive
or
presumptive
is
to
be
disregarded
in
view
of
the
advantages
of
allowing
free
development
to
individuality
for
if
the
injury
feared
is
great
and
the
presumption
that
it
will
occur
is
shown
by
experience
to
be
strong
the
definite
risk
of
evil
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
moral
sanction
must
i
conceive
outweigh
the
indefinite
possibility
of
loss
through
the
repression
of
individuality
in
one
particular
direction
but
further
even
supposing
that
we
could
mark
off
the
sphere
of
individual
option
and
by
some
simple
and
sweeping
formula
still
within
this
sphere
the
individual
if
he
wishes
to
guide
himself
reasonably
on
utilitarian
principles
must
take
some
account
of
all
important
effects
of
his
actions
on
the
happiness
of
others
and
if
he
does
this
methodically
he
must
i
conceive
use
the
empirical
method
which
we
have
examined
in
book
ii
and
to
prevent
any
undue
alarm
at
this
prospect
we
may
observe
that
every
sensible
man
is
commonly
supposed
to
determine
at
least
a
large
part
of
his
conduct
by
what
is
substantially
this
method
it
is
assumed
that
within
the
limits
which
morality
lays
down
he
will
try
to
get
as
much
happiness
as
he
can
for
himself
and
for
other
human
beings
according
to
the
relations
in
which
they
stand
to
him
by
combining
in
some
way
his
own
experience
with
that
of
other
men
as
to
the
felicific
and
infelicific
effects
of
actions
and
it
is
actually
in
this
way
that
each
man
usually
deliberates
what
profession
to
choose
for
himself
or
what
mode
of
education
for
his
children
whether
to
aim
at
marriage
or
remain
single
whether
to
settle
in
town
or
country
in
england
or
abroad
etc
no
doubt
there
are
as
we
saw
other
ends
besides
happiness
such
as
knowledge
beauty
commonly
recognised
as
unquestionably
desirable
and
therefore
largely
pursued
without
consideration
of
ulterior
consequences
but
when
the
pursuit
of
any
of
these
ends
involves
an
apparent
sacrifice
of
happiness
in
other
ways
the
practical
question
whether
under
these
circumstances
such
pursuit
ought
to
be
maintained
or
abandoned
seems
always
decided
by
an
application
however
rough
of
the
method
of
pure
empirical
hedonism
and
in
saying
that
this
must
be
the
method
of
the
utilitarian
moralist
i
only
mean
that
no
other
can
normally
be
applied
in
reducing
to
a
common
measure
the
diverse
elements
of
the
problems
with
which
he
has
to
deal
of
course
in
determining
the
nature
and
importance
of
each
of
these
diverse
considerations
the
utilitarian
art
of
morality
will
lay
various
sciences
under
contribution
thus
for
example
it
will
learn
from
political
economy
what
effects
a
general
censure
of
usurers
or
the
ordinary
commendation
of
liberality
in
almsgiving
is
likely
to
have
on
the
wealth
of
the
community
it
will
learn
from
the
physiologist
the
probable
consequences
to
health
of
a
general
abstinence
from
alcoholic
liquors
or
any
other
restraint
on
appetite
proposed
in
the
name
of
temperance
it
will
learn
from
the
experts
in
any
science
how
far
knowledge
is
likely
to
be
promoted
by
investigations
offensive
to
any
prevalent
moral
or
religious
sentiment
but
how
far
the
increase
of
wealth
or
of
knowledge
or
even
the
improvement
of
health
should
under
any
circumstances
be
subordinated
to
other
considerations
i
know
no
scientific
method
of
determining
other
than
that
of
empirical
hedonism
nor
as
i
have
said
does
it
seem
to
me
that
any
other
method
has
ever
been
applied
or
sought
by
the
common
sense
of
mankind
for
regulating
the
pursuit
of
what
our
older
moralists
called
natural
good
of
all
that
is
intrinsically
desirable
virtue
or
morality
within
the
limits
fixed
by
the
latter
the
utilitarian
here
only
performs
somewhat
more
consistently
and
systematically
than
ordinary
men
the
reasoning
processes
which
are
commonly
admitted
to
be
appropriate
to
the
questions
that
this
pursuit
raises
his
distinctive
characteristic
as
a
utilitarian
is
that
he
has
to
apply
the
same
method
to
the
criticism
and
correction
of
the
limiting
morality
itself
the
particulars
of
this
criticism
will
obviously
vary
almost
indefinitely
with
the
variations
in
human
nature
and
circumstances
i
here
only
propose
to
discuss
the
general
points
of
view
which
a
utilitarian
critic
must
take
in
order
that
no
important
class
of
relevant
considerations
may
be
omitted
let
us
first
recall
the
distinction
previously
noticed
between
duty
as
commonly
conceived
that
to
which
a
man
is
bound
or
obliged
and
praiseworthy
or
excellent
conduct
since
in
considering
the
relation
of
utilitarianism
to
the
moral
judgments
of
common
sense
it
will
be
convenient
to
begin
with
the
former
element
of
current
morality
as
the
more
important
and
indispensable
with
the
of
rules
imposed
by
common
opinion
in
any
society
which
form
a
kind
of
unwritten
legislation
supplementary
to
law
proper
and
enforced
by
the
penalties
of
social
disfavour
and
contempt
this
legislation
as
it
does
not
emanate
from
a
definite
body
of
persons
acting
in
a
corporate
capacity
can
not
be
altered
by
any
formal
deliberations
and
resolutions
of
the
persons
on
whose
it
rests
any
change
in
it
must
therefore
result
from
the
private
action
of
individuals
whether
determined
by
utilitarian
considerations
or
otherwise
as
we
shall
presently
see
the
practical
utilitarian
problem
is
liable
to
be
complicated
by
the
conflict
and
divergence
which
is
found
to
some
extent
in
all
societies
between
the
moral
opinions
of
different
sections
of
the
community
but
it
will
be
convenient
to
confine
our
attention
in
the
first
instance
to
the
case
of
rules
of
duty
clearly
supported
by
common
let
us
suppose
then
that
after
considering
the
consequences
of
any
such
rule
a
utilitarian
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
a
different
rule
would
be
more
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
if
similarly
established
in
a
society
remaining
in
other
respects
the
same
as
at
present
or
in
one
slightly
different
in
so
far
as
our
forecast
of
social
changes
can
be
made
sufficiently
clear
to
furnish
any
basis
for
practice
and
first
we
will
suppose
that
this
new
rule
differs
from
the
old
one
not
only
positively
but
negatively
that
it
does
not
merely
go
beyond
and
include
it
but
actually
conflicts
with
it
before
he
can
decide
that
it
is
right
for
him
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
to
support
the
new
rule
against
the
old
by
example
and
precept
he
ought
to
estimate
the
force
of
certain
disadvantages
necessarily
attendant
upon
such
innovations
which
may
conveniently
be
arranged
under
the
following
heads
in
the
first
place
as
his
own
happiness
and
that
of
others
connected
with
him
form
a
part
of
the
universal
end
at
which
he
aims
he
must
consider
the
importance
to
himself
and
them
of
the
penalties
of
social
disapprobation
which
he
will
incur
taking
into
account
besides
the
immediate
pain
of
this
disapprobation
its
indirect
effect
in
diminishing
his
power
of
serving
society
and
promoting
the
general
happiness
in
other
ways
the
prospect
of
such
pain
and
loss
is
of
course
not
decisive
against
the
innovation
since
it
must
to
some
extent
be
regarded
as
the
regular
price
that
has
to
be
paid
for
the
advantage
of
this
kind
of
reform
in
current
morality
but
here
as
in
many
utilitarian
calculations
everything
depends
on
the
quantity
of
the
effects
produced
which
in
the
case
supposed
may
vary
very
much
from
slight
distrust
and
disfavour
to
severe
condemnation
and
social
exclusion
it
often
seems
that
by
attempting
change
prematurely
an
innovator
may
incur
the
severest
form
of
the
moral
penalty
whereas
if
he
had
waited
a
few
years
he
would
have
been
let
off
with
the
mildest
for
the
hold
which
a
moral
rule
has
over
the
general
mind
commonly
begins
to
decay
from
the
time
that
it
is
seen
to
be
opposed
to
the
calculations
of
expediency
and
it
may
be
better
for
the
community
as
well
as
for
the
individual
that
it
should
not
be
openly
attacked
until
this
process
of
decay
has
reached
a
certain
point
it
is
however
of
more
importance
to
point
out
certain
general
reasons
for
doubting
whether
an
apparent
improvement
will
really
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
others
it
is
possible
that
the
new
rule
though
it
would
be
more
felicific
than
the
old
one
if
it
could
get
itself
equally
established
may
be
not
so
likely
to
be
adopted
or
if
adopted
not
so
likely
to
be
obeyed
by
the
mass
of
the
community
in
which
it
is
proposed
to
innovate
it
may
be
too
subtle
and
refined
or
too
complex
and
elaborate
it
may
require
a
greater
intellectual
development
or
a
higher
degree
of
than
is
to
be
found
in
an
average
member
of
the
community
or
an
exceptional
quality
or
balance
of
feelings
nor
can
it
be
said
in
reply
that
by
the
hypothesis
the
innovator
s
example
must
be
good
to
whatever
extent
it
operates
since
it
tends
to
substitute
a
better
rule
for
a
worse
for
experience
seems
to
show
that
an
example
of
this
kind
is
more
likely
to
be
potent
negatively
than
positively
that
here
as
elsewhere
in
human
affairs
it
is
easier
to
pull
down
than
to
build
up
easier
to
weaken
or
destroy
the
restraining
force
that
a
moral
rule
habitually
and
generally
obeyed
has
over
men
s
minds
than
to
substitute
for
it
a
new
restraining
habit
not
similarly
sustained
by
tradition
and
custom
hence
the
effect
of
an
example
intrinsically
good
may
be
on
the
whole
bad
because
its
destructive
operation
proves
to
be
more
vigorous
than
its
constructive
and
again
such
destructive
effect
must
be
considered
not
only
in
respect
of
the
particular
rule
violated
but
of
all
other
rules
for
just
as
the
breaking
of
any
positive
law
has
an
inevitable
tendency
to
encourage
lawlessness
generally
so
the
violation
of
any
generally
recognised
moral
rule
seems
to
give
a
certain
aid
to
the
forces
that
are
always
tending
towards
moral
anarchy
in
any
society
nor
must
we
neglect
the
reaction
which
any
breach
with
customary
morality
will
have
on
the
agent
s
own
mind
for
the
regulative
habits
and
sentiments
which
each
man
has
received
by
inheritance
or
training
constitute
an
important
force
impelling
his
will
in
the
main
to
conduct
such
as
his
reason
would
dictate
a
natural
auxiliary
as
it
were
to
reason
in
its
conflict
with
seductive
passions
and
appetites
and
it
may
be
practically
dangerous
to
impair
the
strength
of
these
auxiliaries
on
the
other
hand
it
would
seem
that
the
habit
of
acting
rationally
is
the
best
of
all
habits
and
that
it
ought
to
be
the
aim
of
a
reasonable
being
to
bring
all
his
impulses
and
sentiments
into
more
and
more
perfect
harmony
with
reason
and
indeed
when
a
man
has
earnestly
accepted
any
moral
principle
those
of
his
regulative
habits
and
sentiments
that
are
not
in
harmony
with
this
principle
tend
naturally
to
decay
and
disappear
and
it
would
perhaps
be
scarcely
worth
while
to
take
them
into
account
except
for
the
support
that
they
derive
from
the
sympathy
of
others
but
this
last
is
a
consideration
of
great
importance
for
the
moral
impulses
of
each
individual
commonly
draw
a
large
part
of
their
effective
force
from
the
sympathy
of
other
human
beings
i
do
not
merely
mean
that
the
pleasures
and
pains
which
each
derives
sympathetically
from
the
moral
likings
and
aversions
of
others
are
important
as
motives
to
felicific
conduct
no
less
than
as
elements
of
the
individual
s
happiness
i
mean
further
that
the
direct
sympathetic
echo
in
each
man
of
the
judgments
and
sentiments
of
others
concerning
conduct
sustains
his
own
similar
judgments
and
sentiments
through
this
twofold
operation
of
sympathy
it
becomes
practically
much
easier
for
most
men
to
conform
to
a
moral
rule
established
in
the
society
to
which
they
belong
than
to
one
made
by
themselves
and
any
act
by
which
a
man
weakens
the
effect
on
himself
of
this
general
moral
sympathy
tends
to
make
the
performance
of
duty
more
difficult
for
him
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
take
into
account
besides
the
intrinsic
gain
of
the
particular
change
the
general
advantage
of
offering
to
mankind
a
striking
example
of
consistent
utilitarianism
since
in
this
case
as
in
others
a
man
gives
a
stronger
proof
of
genuine
conviction
by
conduct
in
opposition
to
public
opinion
than
he
can
by
conformity
in
order
however
that
this
effect
may
be
produced
it
is
almost
necessary
that
the
should
not
promote
the
innovator
s
personal
convenience
for
in
that
case
it
will
almost
certainly
be
attributed
to
egoistic
motives
however
plausible
the
utilitarian
deduction
of
its
rightness
may
seem
the
exact
force
of
these
various
considerations
will
differ
indefinitely
in
different
cases
and
it
does
not
seem
profitable
to
attempt
any
general
estimate
of
them
but
on
the
whole
it
would
seem
that
the
general
arguments
which
we
have
noticed
constitute
an
important
rational
check
upon
such
utilitarian
innovations
on
morality
as
are
of
the
negative
or
destructive
kind
if
now
we
consider
such
innovations
as
are
merely
positive
and
supplementary
and
consist
in
adding
a
new
rule
to
those
already
established
by
common
sense
it
will
appear
that
there
is
really
no
collision
of
methods
so
far
as
the
utilitarian
s
own
observance
of
the
new
rule
is
concerned
for
as
every
such
rule
is
believed
by
him
to
be
conducive
to
the
common
good
he
is
merely
giving
a
special
and
stricter
interpretation
to
the
general
duty
of
universal
benevolence
where
common
sense
leaves
it
loose
and
indeterminate
hence
the
restraining
considerations
above
enumerated
do
not
apply
to
this
case
and
whatever
it
is
right
for
him
to
do
himself
it
is
obviously
right
for
him
to
approve
and
recommend
to
other
persons
in
similar
circumstances
but
it
is
a
different
question
whether
he
ought
to
seek
to
impose
his
new
rule
on
others
by
express
condemnation
of
all
who
are
not
prepared
to
adopt
it
as
this
involves
not
only
the
immediate
evil
of
the
annoyance
given
to
others
but
also
the
further
danger
of
weakening
the
general
good
effect
of
his
moral
example
through
the
reaction
provoked
by
this
aggressive
attitude
on
this
point
his
decision
will
largely
depend
on
the
prospect
as
far
as
he
can
estimate
it
that
his
innovation
will
meet
with
support
and
sympathy
from
others
it
should
be
observed
however
that
a
great
part
of
the
reform
in
popular
morality
which
a
consistent
utilitarian
will
try
to
introduce
will
probably
lie
not
so
much
in
establishing
new
rules
whether
conflicting
with
the
old
or
merely
supplementary
as
in
enforcing
old
ones
for
there
is
always
a
considerable
part
of
morality
in
the
condition
of
receiving
formal
respect
and
acceptance
while
yet
it
is
not
really
sustained
by
any
effective
force
of
public
opinion
and
the
difference
between
the
moralities
of
any
two
societies
is
often
more
strikingly
exhibited
in
the
different
emphasis
attached
to
various
portions
of
the
moral
code
in
each
than
in
disagreement
as
to
the
rules
which
the
code
should
include
in
the
case
we
are
considering
it
is
chiefly
conduct
which
shows
a
want
of
comprehensive
sympathy
or
of
public
spirit
to
which
the
utilitarian
will
desire
to
attach
a
severer
condemnation
than
is
at
present
directed
against
it
there
is
much
conduct
of
this
sort
of
which
the
immediate
effect
is
to
give
obvious
pleasure
to
individuals
while
the
far
greater
amount
of
harm
that
it
more
remotely
and
indirectly
causes
is
but
dimly
recognised
by
common
sense
such
conduct
therefore
even
when
it
is
allowed
to
be
wrong
is
very
mildly
treated
by
common
opinion
especially
when
it
is
prompted
by
some
impulse
not
still
in
all
such
cases
we
do
not
require
the
promulgation
of
any
new
moral
doctrine
but
merely
a
bracing
and
sharpening
of
the
moral
sentiments
of
society
to
bring
them
into
harmony
with
the
greater
comprehensiveness
of
view
and
the
more
impartial
concern
for
human
happiness
which
characterise
the
utilitarian
system
we
have
hitherto
supposed
that
the
innovator
is
endeavouring
to
introduce
a
new
rule
of
conduct
not
for
himself
only
but
for
others
also
as
more
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
than
the
rule
recognised
by
common
sense
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
this
is
not
the
issue
most
commonly
raised
between
utilitarianism
and
common
sense
but
rather
whether
exceptions
should
be
allowed
to
rules
which
both
sides
accept
as
generally
valid
for
no
one
doubts
that
it
is
conducive
to
the
common
happiness
that
men
should
be
veracious
faithful
to
promises
obedient
to
law
disposed
to
satisfy
the
normal
expectations
of
others
having
their
malevolent
impulses
and
their
sensual
appetites
under
strict
control
but
it
is
thought
that
an
exclusive
regard
to
pleasurable
and
painful
consequences
would
frequently
admit
exceptions
to
rules
which
common
sense
imposes
as
absolute
it
should
however
be
observed
that
the
admission
of
an
exception
on
general
grounds
is
merely
the
establishment
of
a
more
complex
and
delicate
rule
instead
of
one
that
is
broader
and
simpler
for
if
it
is
conducive
to
the
general
good
that
such
an
exception
be
admitted
in
one
case
it
will
be
equally
so
in
all
similar
cases
suppose
that
a
utilitarian
thinks
it
on
general
grounds
right
to
answer
falsely
a
question
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
has
voted
at
a
political
election
where
the
voting
is
by
secret
ballot
his
reasons
will
probably
be
that
the
utilitarian
prohibition
of
falsehood
is
based
on
the
harm
done
by
misleading
particular
individuals
and
the
tendency
of
false
statements
to
diminish
the
mutual
confidence
that
men
ought
to
have
in
each
other
s
assertions
and
that
in
this
exceptional
case
it
is
expedient
that
the
questioner
should
be
misled
while
in
so
far
as
the
falsehood
tends
to
produce
a
general
distrust
of
all
assertions
as
to
the
manner
in
which
a
man
has
voted
it
only
furthers
the
end
for
which
voting
has
been
made
secret
it
is
evident
that
if
these
reasons
are
valid
for
any
person
they
are
valid
for
all
persons
in
fact
that
they
establish
the
expediency
of
a
new
general
rule
in
respect
of
truth
and
falsehood
more
complicated
than
the
old
one
a
rule
which
the
utilitarian
as
such
should
desire
to
be
universally
obeyed
there
are
of
course
some
kinds
of
moral
innovation
which
from
the
nature
of
the
case
are
not
likely
to
occur
frequently
as
where
utilitarian
reasoning
leads
a
man
to
take
part
in
a
political
revolution
or
to
support
a
public
measure
in
opposition
to
what
common
sense
regards
as
justice
or
good
faith
still
in
such
cases
a
rational
utilitarian
will
usually
proceed
on
general
principles
which
he
would
desire
all
persons
in
similar
circumstances
to
carry
into
effect
we
have
however
to
consider
another
kind
of
exceptions
differing
fundamentally
from
this
which
utilitarianism
seems
to
admit
where
the
agent
does
not
think
it
expedient
that
the
rule
on
which
he
himself
acts
should
be
universally
adopted
and
yet
maintains
that
his
individual
act
is
right
as
producing
a
greater
balance
of
pleasure
over
pain
than
any
other
conduct
open
to
him
would
produce
now
we
can
not
fairly
argue
that
because
a
large
aggregate
of
acts
would
cause
more
harm
than
good
therefore
any
single
act
of
the
kind
will
produce
this
effect
it
may
even
be
a
straining
of
language
to
say
that
it
has
a
to
produce
it
no
one
would
say
that
because
an
army
walking
over
a
bridge
would
break
it
down
therefore
the
crossing
of
a
single
traveller
has
a
tendency
to
destroy
it
and
just
as
a
prudent
physician
in
giving
rules
of
diet
recommends
an
occasional
deviation
from
them
as
more
conducive
to
the
health
of
the
body
than
absolute
regularity
so
there
may
be
rules
of
social
behaviour
of
which
the
general
observance
is
necessary
to
the
of
the
community
while
yet
a
certain
amount
of
is
rather
advantageous
than
otherwise
here
however
we
seem
brought
into
conflict
with
kant
s
fundamental
principle
that
a
right
action
must
be
one
of
which
the
agent
could
will
the
maxim
to
be
law
but
as
was
before
noticed
in
the
particular
case
of
veracity
we
must
admit
an
application
of
this
principle
which
importantly
modifies
its
practical
force
we
must
admit
the
case
where
the
belief
that
the
action
in
question
will
not
be
widely
imitated
is
an
essential
qualification
of
the
maxim
which
the
kantian
principle
is
applied
to
test
for
this
principle
at
least
so
far
as
i
have
accepted
it
as
means
no
more
than
that
an
act
if
right
for
any
individual
must
be
right
on
general
grounds
and
therefore
for
some
of
persons
it
therefore
can
not
prevent
us
from
defining
this
class
by
the
characteristic
of
believing
that
the
act
will
remain
an
exceptional
one
of
course
if
this
belief
turns
out
to
be
erroneous
serious
harm
may
possibly
result
but
this
is
no
more
than
may
be
said
of
many
other
utilitarian
deductions
nor
is
it
difficult
to
find
instances
of
conduct
which
common
sense
holds
to
be
legitimate
solely
on
the
ground
that
we
have
no
fear
of
its
being
too
widely
imitated
take
for
example
the
case
of
celibacy
a
universal
refusal
to
propagate
the
human
species
would
be
the
greatest
of
conceivable
crimes
from
a
utilitarian
point
of
view
that
is
according
to
the
commonly
accepted
belief
in
the
superiority
of
human
happiness
to
that
of
other
animals
and
hence
the
principle
in
question
applied
without
the
qualification
above
given
would
make
it
a
crime
in
any
one
to
choose
celibacy
as
the
state
most
conducive
to
his
own
happiness
but
common
sense
in
the
present
age
at
least
regards
such
preference
as
within
the
limits
of
right
conduct
because
there
is
no
fear
that
population
will
not
be
sufficiently
kept
up
as
in
fact
the
tendency
to
propagate
is
thought
to
exist
rather
in
excess
than
otherwise
in
this
case
it
is
a
impulse
on
the
average
strength
of
which
we
think
we
may
reckon
but
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
formal
or
universal
reason
why
the
same
procedure
should
not
be
applied
by
utilitarians
to
an
actually
existing
moral
sentiment
the
result
would
be
a
discrepancy
of
a
peculiar
kind
between
utilitarianism
and
morality
as
the
very
firmness
with
which
the
latter
is
established
would
be
the
utilitarian
ground
for
relieving
the
individual
of
its
obligations
we
are
supposed
to
see
that
general
happiness
will
be
enhanced
just
as
the
excellence
of
a
metrical
composition
is
by
a
slight
admixture
of
irregularity
along
with
a
general
observance
of
received
rules
and
hence
to
justify
the
irregular
conduct
of
a
few
individuals
on
the
ground
that
the
supply
of
regular
conduct
from
other
members
of
the
community
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
adequate
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
this
reasoning
can
be
shown
to
be
necessarily
unsound
as
applied
to
human
society
as
at
present
constituted
but
the
cases
in
which
it
could
really
be
thought
to
be
applicable
by
any
one
sincerely
desirous
of
promoting
the
general
happiness
must
certainly
be
rare
for
it
should
be
observed
that
it
makes
a
fundamental
difference
whether
the
sentiment
in
mankind
generally
on
which
we
rely
to
sustain
sufficiently
a
general
rule
while
admitting
exceptions
thereto
is
moral
or
because
a
moral
sentiment
is
inseparable
from
the
conviction
that
the
conduct
to
which
it
prompts
is
objectively
right
right
whether
or
not
it
is
thought
or
felt
to
be
so
for
oneself
and
all
similar
persons
in
similar
circumstances
it
can
not
therefore
coexist
with
approval
of
the
contrary
conduct
in
any
one
case
unless
this
case
is
distinguished
by
some
material
difference
other
than
the
mere
in
the
agent
of
the
ordinary
moral
sentiment
against
his
conduct
thus
assuming
that
general
unveracity
and
general
celibacy
would
both
be
evils
of
the
worst
kind
we
may
still
all
regard
it
as
legitimate
for
men
in
general
to
remain
celibate
if
they
like
on
account
of
the
strength
of
the
natural
sentiments
prompting
to
marriage
because
the
existence
of
these
sentiments
in
ordinary
human
beings
is
not
affected
by
the
universal
recognition
of
the
legitimacy
of
celibacy
but
we
can
not
similarly
all
regard
it
as
legitimate
for
men
to
tell
lies
if
they
like
however
strong
the
actually
existing
sentiment
against
lying
may
be
because
as
soon
as
this
legitimacy
is
generally
recognised
the
sentiment
must
be
expected
to
decay
and
vanish
if
therefore
we
were
all
enlightened
utilitarians
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
justify
himself
in
making
false
statements
while
admitting
it
to
be
inexpedient
for
persons
similarly
conditioned
to
make
them
as
he
would
have
no
ground
for
believing
that
persons
similarly
conditioned
would
act
differently
from
himself
the
case
no
doubt
is
different
in
society
as
actually
constituted
it
is
conceivable
that
the
practically
effective
morality
in
such
a
society
resting
on
a
basis
independent
of
utilitarian
or
any
other
reasonings
may
not
be
materially
affected
by
the
particular
act
or
expressed
opinion
of
a
particular
individual
but
the
circumstances
are
i
conceive
very
rare
in
which
a
really
conscientious
person
could
feel
so
sure
of
this
as
to
conclude
that
by
approving
a
particular
violation
of
a
rule
of
which
the
though
not
observance
is
plainly
expedient
he
will
not
probably
do
harm
on
the
whole
especially
as
all
the
objections
to
innovation
noticed
in
the
previous
section
apply
with
increased
force
if
the
innovator
does
not
even
claim
to
be
introducing
a
new
and
better
general
rule
it
appears
to
me
therefore
that
the
cases
in
which
practical
doubts
are
likely
to
arise
as
to
whether
exceptions
should
be
permitted
from
ordinary
rules
on
utilitarian
principles
will
mostly
be
those
which
i
discussed
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
section
where
the
exceptions
are
not
claimed
for
a
few
individuals
on
the
mere
ground
of
their
probable
fewness
but
either
for
persons
generally
under
exceptional
circumstances
or
for
a
class
of
persons
defined
by
exceptional
qualities
of
intellect
temperament
or
character
in
such
cases
the
utilitarian
may
have
no
doubt
that
in
a
community
consisting
generally
of
enlightened
utilitarians
these
grounds
for
exceptional
ethical
treatment
would
be
regarded
as
valid
still
he
may
as
i
have
said
doubt
whether
the
more
refined
and
complicated
rule
which
recognises
such
exceptions
is
adapted
for
the
community
in
which
he
is
actually
living
and
whether
the
attempt
to
introduce
it
is
not
likely
to
do
more
harm
by
weakening
current
morality
than
good
by
improving
its
quality
supposing
such
a
doubt
to
arise
either
in
a
case
of
this
kind
or
in
one
of
the
rare
cases
discussed
in
the
preceding
paragraph
it
becomes
necessary
that
the
utilitarian
should
consider
carefully
the
extent
to
which
his
advice
or
example
are
likely
to
influence
persons
to
whom
they
would
be
dangerous
and
it
is
evident
that
the
result
of
this
consideration
may
depend
largely
on
the
degree
of
publicity
which
he
gives
to
either
advice
or
example
thus
on
utilitarian
principles
it
may
be
right
to
do
and
privately
recommend
under
certain
circumstances
what
it
would
not
be
right
to
advocate
openly
it
may
be
right
to
teach
openly
to
one
set
of
persons
what
it
would
be
wrong
to
teach
to
others
it
may
be
conceivably
right
to
do
if
it
can
be
done
with
comparative
secrecy
what
it
would
be
wrong
to
do
in
the
face
of
the
world
and
even
if
perfect
secrecy
can
be
reasonably
expected
what
it
would
be
wrong
to
recommend
by
private
advice
or
example
these
conclusions
are
all
of
a
paradoxical
character
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
moral
consciousness
of
a
plain
man
broadly
repudiates
the
general
notion
of
an
esoteric
morality
differing
from
that
popularly
taught
and
it
would
be
commonly
agreed
that
an
action
which
would
be
bad
if
done
openly
is
not
rendered
good
by
secrecy
we
may
observe
however
that
there
are
strong
utilitarian
reasons
for
maintaining
generally
this
latter
common
opinion
for
it
is
obviously
advantageous
generally
speaking
that
acts
which
it
is
expedient
to
repress
by
social
disapprobation
should
become
known
as
otherwise
the
disapprobation
can
not
operate
so
that
it
seems
inexpedient
to
support
by
any
moral
encouragement
the
natural
disposition
of
men
in
general
to
conceal
their
wrong
doings
besides
that
the
concealment
would
in
most
cases
have
importantly
injurious
effects
on
the
agent
s
habits
of
veracity
thus
the
utilitarian
conclusion
carefully
stated
would
seem
to
be
this
that
the
opinion
that
secrecy
may
render
an
action
right
which
would
not
otherwise
be
so
should
itself
be
kept
comparatively
secret
and
similarly
it
seems
expedient
that
the
doctrine
that
esoteric
morality
is
expedient
should
itself
be
kept
esoteric
or
if
this
concealment
be
difficult
to
maintain
it
may
be
desirable
that
common
sense
should
repudiate
the
doctrines
which
it
is
expedient
to
confine
to
an
enlightened
few
and
thus
a
utilitarian
may
reasonably
desire
on
utilitarian
principles
that
some
of
his
conclusions
should
be
rejected
by
mankind
generally
or
even
that
the
vulgar
should
keep
aloof
from
his
system
as
a
whole
in
so
far
as
the
inevitable
indefiniteness
and
complexity
of
its
calculations
render
it
likely
to
lead
to
bad
results
in
their
hands
of
course
as
i
have
said
in
an
ideal
community
of
enlightened
utilitarians
this
swarm
of
perplexities
and
paradoxes
would
vanish
as
in
such
a
society
no
one
can
have
any
ground
for
believing
that
other
persons
will
act
on
moral
principles
different
from
those
which
he
adopts
and
any
enlightened
utilitarian
must
of
course
desire
this
consummation
as
all
conflict
of
moral
opinion
must
be
regarded
as
an
evil
as
tending
to
impair
the
force
of
morality
generally
in
its
resistance
to
seductive
impulses
still
such
conflict
may
be
a
necessary
evil
in
the
actual
condition
of
civilised
communities
in
which
there
are
so
many
different
degrees
of
intellectual
and
moral
development
we
have
thus
been
led
to
the
discussion
of
the
question
which
we
reserved
in
the
last
section
viz
how
utilitarianism
should
deal
with
the
fact
of
divergent
moral
opinions
held
simultaneously
by
different
members
of
the
same
society
for
it
has
become
plain
that
though
two
different
kinds
of
conduct
can
not
both
be
right
under
the
same
circumstances
two
contradictory
opinions
as
to
the
rightness
of
conduct
may
possibly
both
be
expedient
it
may
conduce
most
to
the
general
happiness
that
should
do
a
certain
act
and
at
the
same
time
that
should
blame
it
the
utilitarian
of
course
can
not
really
join
in
the
disapproval
but
he
may
think
it
expedient
to
leave
it
unshaken
and
at
the
same
time
may
think
it
right
if
placed
in
the
supposed
circumstances
to
do
the
act
that
is
generally
disapproved
and
so
generally
it
may
be
best
on
the
whole
that
there
should
be
conflicting
codes
of
morality
in
a
given
society
at
a
certain
stage
of
its
development
and
as
i
have
already
hinted
the
same
general
reasoning
from
the
probable
origin
of
the
moral
sense
and
its
flexible
adjustment
to
the
varying
conditions
of
human
life
which
furnished
a
presumption
that
morality
is
roughly
coincident
with
the
utilitarian
code
proper
for
men
as
now
constituted
may
be
applied
in
favour
of
these
divergent
codes
also
it
may
be
said
that
these
too
form
part
of
the
complex
adjustment
of
man
to
his
circumstances
and
that
they
are
needed
to
supplement
and
qualify
the
morality
of
common
sense
however
paradoxical
this
doctrine
may
appear
we
can
find
cases
where
it
seems
to
be
implicitly
accepted
by
common
sense
or
at
least
where
it
is
required
to
make
common
sense
consistent
with
itself
let
us
consider
for
example
the
common
moral
judgments
concerning
rebellions
it
is
commonly
thought
on
the
one
hand
that
these
abrupt
breaches
of
order
are
sometimes
morally
necessary
and
on
the
other
hand
that
they
ought
always
to
be
vigorously
resisted
and
in
case
of
failure
punished
by
extreme
penalties
inflicted
at
least
on
the
for
otherwise
they
would
be
attempted
under
circumstances
where
there
was
no
sufficient
justification
for
them
but
it
seems
evident
that
in
the
actual
condition
of
men
s
moral
sentiments
this
vigorous
repression
requires
the
support
of
a
strong
body
of
opinion
condemning
the
rebels
as
wrong
and
not
merely
as
mistaken
in
their
calculations
of
the
chances
of
success
for
similar
reasons
it
may
possibly
be
expedient
on
the
whole
that
certain
special
relaxations
of
certain
moral
rules
should
continue
to
exist
in
certain
professions
and
sections
of
society
while
at
the
same
time
they
continue
to
be
disapproved
by
the
rest
of
the
society
the
evils
however
which
must
spring
from
this
permanent
conflict
of
opinion
are
so
grave
that
an
enlightened
utilitarian
will
probably
in
most
cases
attempt
to
remove
it
by
either
openly
maintaining
the
need
of
a
relaxation
of
the
ordinary
moral
rule
under
the
special
circumstances
in
question
or
on
the
other
hand
endeavouring
to
get
the
ordinary
rule
recognised
and
enforced
by
all
conscientious
persons
in
that
section
of
society
where
its
breach
has
become
habitual
and
of
these
two
courses
it
seems
likely
that
he
will
in
most
cases
adopt
the
latter
since
such
rules
are
most
commonly
found
on
examination
to
have
been
relaxed
rather
for
the
convenience
of
individuals
than
in
the
interest
of
the
community
at
large
finally
let
us
consider
the
general
relation
of
utilitarianism
to
that
part
of
common
morality
which
extends
beyond
the
range
of
strict
duty
that
is
to
the
ideal
of
character
and
conduct
which
in
any
community
at
any
given
time
is
commonly
admired
and
praised
as
the
sum
of
excellences
or
perfections
to
begin
it
must
be
allowed
that
this
distinction
between
excellence
and
strict
duty
does
not
seem
properly
admissible
in
utilitarianism
except
so
far
as
some
excellences
are
only
partially
and
indirectly
within
the
control
of
the
will
and
we
require
to
distinguish
the
realisation
of
these
in
conduct
from
the
performance
of
duty
proper
which
is
always
something
that
be
done
at
any
moment
for
a
utilitarian
must
hold
that
it
is
always
wrong
for
a
man
knowingly
to
do
anything
other
than
what
he
believes
to
be
most
conducive
to
universal
happiness
still
it
seems
practically
expedient
and
therefore
indirectly
reasonable
on
utilitarian
principles
to
retain
in
judging
even
the
strictly
voluntary
conduct
of
others
the
distinction
between
a
part
that
is
praiseworthy
and
admirable
and
a
part
that
is
merely
right
because
it
is
natural
to
us
to
compare
any
individual
s
character
or
conduct
not
with
our
highest
ideal
utilitarian
or
otherwise
but
with
a
certain
average
standard
and
to
admire
what
rises
above
the
standard
and
it
seems
ultimately
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
that
such
natural
sentiments
of
admiration
should
be
encouraged
and
developed
for
human
nature
seems
to
require
the
double
stimulus
of
praise
and
blame
from
others
in
order
to
the
best
performance
of
duty
that
it
can
at
present
attain
so
that
the
social
sanction
would
be
less
effective
if
it
became
purely
penal
indeed
since
the
pains
of
remorse
and
disapprobation
are
in
themselves
to
be
avoided
it
is
plain
that
the
utilitarian
construction
of
a
jural
morality
is
essentially
that
is
it
prescribes
its
own
avoidance
of
any
department
of
conduct
in
which
the
addition
that
can
be
made
to
happiness
through
the
enforcement
of
rules
sustained
by
social
penalties
appears
doubtful
or
inconsiderable
in
such
departments
however
the
æsthetic
phase
of
morality
may
still
reasonably
find
a
place
we
may
properly
admire
and
praise
where
it
would
be
inexpedient
to
judge
and
condemn
we
may
conclude
then
that
it
is
reasonable
for
a
utilitarian
to
praise
any
conduct
more
felicific
in
its
tendency
than
what
an
average
man
would
do
under
the
given
circumstances
being
aware
of
course
that
the
limit
down
to
which
praise
worthiness
extends
must
be
relative
to
the
particular
state
of
moral
progress
reached
by
mankind
generally
in
his
age
and
country
and
that
it
is
desirable
to
make
continual
efforts
to
elevate
this
standard
similarly
the
utilitarian
will
praise
the
dispositions
or
permanent
qualities
of
character
of
which
felicific
conduct
is
conceived
to
be
the
result
and
the
motives
that
are
conceived
to
prompt
to
it
when
it
would
be
a
clear
gain
to
the
general
happiness
that
these
should
become
more
frequent
and
as
we
have
seen
he
may
without
inconsistency
admire
the
disposition
or
motive
if
it
is
of
a
kind
which
it
is
generally
desirable
to
encourage
even
while
he
disapproves
of
the
conduct
to
which
it
has
led
in
any
particular
case
passing
now
to
compare
the
contents
of
the
utilitarian
ideal
of
character
with
the
virtues
and
other
excellences
recognised
by
common
sense
we
may
observe
first
that
general
coincidence
between
the
two
on
which
hume
and
others
have
insisted
no
quality
has
ever
been
praised
as
excellent
by
mankind
generally
which
can
not
be
shown
to
have
some
marked
felicific
effect
and
to
be
within
proper
limits
obviously
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
still
it
does
not
follow
that
such
qualities
are
always
fostered
and
encouraged
by
society
in
the
proportion
which
a
utilitarian
would
desire
in
fact
it
is
a
common
observation
to
make
in
contemplating
the
morality
of
societies
other
than
our
own
that
some
useful
qualities
are
unduly
neglected
while
others
are
and
even
admired
when
they
exist
in
such
excess
as
to
become
on
the
whole
infelicific
the
consistent
utilitarian
may
therefore
find
it
necessary
to
rectify
the
prevalent
moral
ideal
in
important
particulars
and
here
it
scarcely
seems
that
he
will
find
any
such
utilitarian
restrictions
on
innovation
as
appeared
to
exist
in
the
case
of
commonly
received
rules
of
duty
for
the
notions
of
the
different
excellences
of
conduct
considered
as
extending
beyond
the
range
of
strict
duty
are
generally
so
vague
as
to
offer
at
least
no
definite
resistance
to
a
utilitarian
interpretation
of
their
scope
by
teaching
and
acting
upon
such
an
interpretation
a
man
is
in
no
danger
of
being
brought
into
infelicific
discord
with
common
sense
especially
since
the
ideal
of
moral
excellence
seems
to
vary
within
the
limits
of
the
same
community
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
the
code
of
strict
duty
for
example
a
man
who
in
an
age
when
excessive
asceticism
is
praised
sets
an
example
of
enjoying
harmless
bodily
pleasures
or
who
in
circles
where
useless
daring
is
admired
prefers
to
exhibit
and
commend
caution
and
discretion
at
the
worst
misses
some
praise
that
he
might
otherwise
have
earned
and
is
thought
a
little
dull
or
unaspiring
he
does
not
come
into
any
patent
conflict
with
common
opinion
perhaps
we
may
say
generally
that
an
enlightened
utilitarian
is
likely
to
lay
less
stress
on
the
cultivation
of
those
negative
virtues
tendencies
to
restrict
and
refrain
which
are
prominent
in
the
ideal
of
character
and
to
set
more
value
in
comparison
on
those
qualities
of
mind
which
are
the
direct
source
of
positive
pleasure
to
the
agent
or
to
others
some
of
which
common
sense
scarcely
recognises
as
excellences
still
he
will
not
carry
this
innovation
to
such
a
pitch
as
to
incur
general
condemnation
for
no
enlightened
utilitarian
can
ignore
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
restrictive
and
repressive
virtues
or
think
that
they
are
sufficiently
developed
in
ordinary
men
at
the
present
time
so
that
they
may
properly
be
excluded
from
moral
admiration
though
he
may
hold
that
they
have
been
too
prominent
to
the
neglect
of
other
valuable
qualities
in
the
common
conception
of
moral
perfection
nay
we
may
even
venture
to
say
that
under
most
circumstances
a
man
who
earnestly
and
successfully
endeavours
to
realise
the
utilitarian
ideal
however
he
may
deviate
from
the
type
of
a
perfect
character
is
likely
to
win
sufficient
recognition
and
praise
from
common
sense
for
whether
it
be
true
or
not
that
the
whole
of
morality
has
sprung
from
the
root
of
sympathy
it
is
certain
that
and
sympathy
combined
are
sufficiently
strong
in
average
men
to
dispose
them
to
grateful
admiration
of
any
exceptional
efforts
to
promote
the
common
good
even
though
these
efforts
may
take
a
somewhat
novel
form
to
any
exhibition
of
more
extended
sympathy
or
more
fervent
public
spirit
than
is
ordinarily
shown
and
any
attempt
to
develop
these
equalities
in
others
common
sense
is
rarely
unresponsive
provided
of
course
that
these
impulses
are
accompanied
with
adequate
knowledge
of
actual
circumstances
and
insight
into
the
relation
of
means
to
ends
and
that
they
do
not
run
counter
to
any
recognised
rules
of
duty
and
it
seems
to
be
principally
in
this
direction
that
the
recent
spread
of
utilitarianism
has
positively
modified
the
ideal
of
our
society
and
is
likely
to
modify
it
further
in
the
future
hence
the
stress
which
utilitarians
are
apt
to
lay
on
social
and
political
activity
of
all
kinds
and
the
tendency
which
utilitarian
ethics
have
always
shown
to
pass
over
into
politics
for
one
who
values
conduct
in
proportion
to
its
felicific
consequences
will
naturally
set
a
higher
estimate
on
effective
beneficence
in
public
affairs
than
on
the
purest
manifestation
of
virtue
in
the
details
of
private
life
while
on
the
other
hand
an
intuitionist
though
no
doubt
vaguely
recognising
that
a
man
ought
to
do
all
the
good
he
can
in
public
affairs
still
commonly
holds
that
virtue
may
be
as
fully
and
as
admirably
exhibited
on
a
small
as
on
a
large
scale
a
sincere
utilitarian
therefore
is
likely
to
be
an
eager
politician
but
on
what
principles
his
political
action
ought
to
be
determined
it
scarcely
lies
within
the
scope
of
this
treatise
to
investigate
footnotes
i
do
not
mean
that
this
sentiment
is
in
my
view
incompatible
with
utilitarianism
i
mean
that
it
must
not
attach
itself
to
any
subordinate
rules
of
conduct
but
only
to
the
supreme
principle
of
acting
with
impartial
concern
for
all
elements
of
general
happiness
for
example
bain
in
pp
this
sentence
is
not
an
exact
quotation
but
a
summary
of
the
doctrine
set
forth
by
mill
in
his
treatise
introduction
see
mill
chap
iv
it
may
be
observed
that
mill
s
doctrine
is
certainly
opposed
to
common
sense
since
it
would
exclude
from
censure
almost
all
forms
of
sexual
immorality
committed
by
unmarried
and
independent
adults
cf
book
iii
chap
xiv
cf
especially
book
iii
chap
ii
cf
book
iii
chap
and
chap
xiii
book
iii
chap
vii
in
particular
cases
however
they
seem
to
be
admitted
by
common
sense
to
a
certain
extent
for
example
it
would
be
commonly
thought
wrong
to
express
in
public
speeches
disturbing
religious
or
political
opinions
which
may
be
legitimately
published
in
books
cf
chap
iii
of
this
book
we
have
seen
that
a
utilitarian
may
sometimes
have
to
override
these
rules
but
then
the
case
falls
under
the
head
discussed
in
the
previous
section
concluding
chapter
the
mutual
relations
of
the
three
methods
in
the
greater
part
of
the
treatise
of
which
the
final
chapter
has
now
been
reached
we
have
been
employed
in
examining
three
methods
of
determining
right
conduct
which
are
for
the
most
part
found
more
or
less
vaguely
combined
in
the
practical
reasonings
of
ordinary
men
but
which
it
has
been
my
aim
to
develop
as
separately
as
possible
a
complete
synthesis
of
these
different
methods
is
not
attempted
in
the
present
work
at
the
same
time
it
would
hardly
be
satisfactory
to
conclude
the
analysis
of
them
without
some
discussion
of
their
mutual
relations
indeed
we
have
already
found
it
expedient
to
do
this
to
a
considerable
extent
in
the
course
of
our
examination
of
the
separate
methods
thus
in
the
present
and
preceding
books
we
have
directly
or
indirectly
gone
through
a
pretty
full
examination
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
intuitional
and
utilitarian
methods
we
have
found
that
the
common
antithesis
between
intuitionists
and
utilitarians
must
be
entirely
discarded
since
such
abstract
moral
principles
as
we
can
admit
to
be
really
are
not
only
not
incompatible
with
a
utilitarian
system
but
even
seem
required
to
furnish
a
rational
basis
for
such
a
system
thus
we
have
seen
that
the
essence
of
justice
or
equity
in
so
far
as
it
is
clear
and
certain
is
that
different
individuals
are
not
to
be
treated
differently
except
on
grounds
of
universal
application
and
that
such
grounds
again
are
supplied
by
the
principle
of
universal
benevolence
that
sets
before
each
man
the
happiness
of
all
others
as
an
object
of
pursuit
no
less
worthy
than
his
own
while
other
virtues
seem
to
be
fitly
explained
as
special
manifestations
of
impartial
benevolence
under
various
circumstances
of
human
life
or
else
as
habits
and
dispositions
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
prudent
or
beneficent
behaviour
under
the
seductive
force
of
various
impulses
and
although
there
are
other
rules
which
our
common
moral
sense
when
first
interrogated
seems
to
enunciate
as
absolutely
binding
it
has
appeared
that
careful
and
systematic
reflection
on
this
very
common
sense
as
expressed
in
the
habitual
moral
judgments
of
ordinary
men
results
in
exhibiting
the
real
subordination
of
these
rules
to
the
fundamental
principles
above
given
then
further
this
method
of
systematising
particular
virtues
and
duties
receives
very
strong
support
from
a
comparative
study
of
the
history
of
morality
as
the
variations
in
the
moral
codes
of
different
societies
at
different
stages
correspond
in
a
great
measure
to
differences
in
the
actual
or
believed
tendencies
of
certain
kinds
of
conduct
to
promote
the
general
happiness
of
different
portions
of
the
human
race
while
again
the
most
probable
conjectures
as
to
the
condition
and
original
derivation
of
the
moral
faculty
seem
to
be
entirely
in
harmony
with
this
view
no
doubt
even
if
this
synthesis
of
methods
be
completely
accepted
there
will
remain
some
discrepancy
in
details
between
our
particular
moral
sentiments
and
unreasoned
judgments
on
the
one
hand
and
the
apparent
results
of
special
utilitarian
calculations
on
the
other
and
we
may
often
have
some
practical
difficulty
in
balancing
the
latter
against
the
more
general
utilitarian
reasons
for
obeying
the
former
but
there
seems
to
be
no
longer
any
theoretical
perplexity
as
to
the
principles
for
determining
social
duty
it
remains
for
us
to
consider
the
relation
of
the
two
species
of
hedonism
which
we
have
distinguished
as
universalistic
and
egoistic
in
chap
ii
of
this
book
we
have
discussed
the
rational
process
called
by
a
stretch
of
language
proof
by
which
one
who
holds
it
reasonable
to
aim
at
his
own
greatest
happiness
may
be
determined
to
take
universal
happiness
instead
as
his
ultimate
standard
of
right
conduct
we
have
seen
however
that
the
application
of
this
process
requires
that
the
egoist
should
affirm
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
his
own
greatest
happiness
is
not
merely
the
rational
ultimate
end
for
himself
but
a
part
of
universal
good
and
he
may
avoid
the
proof
of
utilitarianism
by
declining
to
affirm
this
it
would
be
contrary
to
common
sense
to
deny
that
the
distinction
between
any
one
individual
and
any
other
is
real
and
fundamental
and
that
consequently
i
am
concerned
with
the
quality
of
my
existence
as
an
individual
in
a
sense
fundamentally
important
in
which
i
am
not
concerned
with
the
quality
of
the
existence
of
other
individuals
and
this
being
so
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
proved
that
this
distinction
is
not
to
be
taken
as
fundamental
in
determining
the
ultimate
end
of
rational
action
for
an
individual
and
it
may
be
observed
that
most
utilitarians
however
anxious
they
have
been
to
convince
men
of
the
reasonableness
of
aiming
at
happiness
generally
have
not
commonly
sought
to
attain
this
result
by
any
logical
transition
from
the
egoistic
to
the
universalistic
principle
they
have
relied
almost
entirely
on
the
sanctions
of
utilitarian
rules
that
is
on
the
pleasures
gained
or
pains
avoided
by
the
individual
conforming
to
them
indeed
if
an
egoist
remains
impervious
to
what
we
have
called
proof
the
only
way
of
rationally
inducing
him
to
aim
at
the
happiness
of
all
is
to
show
him
that
his
own
greatest
happiness
can
be
best
attained
by
so
doing
and
further
even
if
a
man
admits
the
of
the
principle
of
rational
benevolence
he
may
still
hold
that
his
own
happiness
is
an
end
which
it
is
irrational
for
him
to
sacrifice
to
any
other
and
that
therefore
a
harmony
between
the
maxim
of
prudence
and
the
maxim
of
rational
benevolence
must
be
somehow
demonstrated
if
morality
is
to
be
made
completely
rational
this
latter
view
indeed
as
i
have
before
said
appears
to
me
on
the
whole
the
view
of
common
sense
and
it
is
that
which
i
myself
hold
it
thus
becomes
needful
to
examine
how
far
and
in
what
way
the
required
demonstration
can
be
effected
now
in
so
far
as
utilitarian
morality
coincides
with
that
of
common
sense
as
we
have
seen
that
it
does
in
the
main
this
investigation
has
been
partly
performed
in
chap
of
book
ii
it
there
appeared
that
while
in
any
tolerable
state
of
society
the
performance
of
duties
towards
others
and
the
exercise
of
social
virtues
seem
likely
to
coincide
with
the
attainment
of
the
greatest
possible
happiness
in
the
long
run
for
the
virtuous
agent
still
the
and
of
this
coincidence
are
at
least
incapable
of
empirical
proof
and
that
indeed
the
more
carefully
we
analyse
and
estimate
the
different
sanctions
legal
social
and
conscientious
considered
as
operating
under
the
actual
conditions
of
human
life
the
more
difficult
it
seems
to
believe
that
they
can
be
always
adequate
to
produce
this
coincidence
the
natural
effect
of
this
argument
upon
a
convinced
utilitarian
is
merely
to
make
him
anxious
to
alter
the
actual
conditions
of
human
life
and
it
would
certainly
be
a
most
valuable
contribution
to
the
actual
happiness
of
mankind
if
we
could
so
improve
the
adjustment
of
the
machine
of
law
in
any
society
and
so
stimulate
and
direct
the
common
awards
of
praise
and
blame
and
so
develop
and
train
the
moral
sense
of
the
members
of
the
community
as
to
render
it
clearly
prudent
for
every
individual
to
promote
as
much
as
possible
the
general
good
however
we
are
not
now
considering
what
a
consistent
utilitarian
will
try
to
effect
for
the
future
but
what
a
consistent
egoist
is
to
do
in
the
present
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
as
things
are
whatever
difference
exists
between
utilitarian
morality
and
that
of
common
sense
is
of
such
a
kind
as
to
render
the
coincidence
with
egoism
still
more
improbable
in
the
case
of
the
former
for
we
have
seen
that
utilitarianism
is
more
rigid
than
common
sense
in
exacting
the
sacrifice
of
the
agent
s
private
interests
where
they
are
incompatible
with
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
and
of
course
in
so
far
as
the
utilitarian
s
principles
bring
him
into
conflict
with
any
of
the
commonly
accepted
rules
of
morality
the
whole
force
of
the
social
sanction
operates
to
deter
him
from
what
he
conceives
to
be
his
duty
there
are
however
writers
of
the
utilitarian
school
who
seem
to
maintain
or
imply
that
by
due
contemplation
of
the
paramount
importance
of
sympathy
as
an
element
of
human
happiness
we
shall
be
led
to
see
the
coincidence
of
the
good
of
each
with
the
good
of
all
in
opposing
this
view
i
am
as
far
as
possible
from
any
wish
to
depreciate
the
value
of
sympathy
as
a
source
of
happiness
even
to
human
beings
as
at
present
constituted
indeed
i
am
of
opinion
that
its
pleasures
and
pains
really
constitute
a
great
part
of
that
internal
reward
of
social
virtue
and
punishment
of
social
misconduct
which
in
book
ii
chap
i
roughly
set
down
as
due
to
the
moral
sentiments
for
in
fact
though
i
can
to
some
extent
distinguish
sympathetic
from
strictly
moral
feelings
in
introspective
analysis
of
my
own
consciousness
i
can
not
say
precisely
in
what
proportion
these
two
elements
are
combined
for
instance
i
seem
able
to
distinguish
the
sense
of
the
ignobility
of
egoism
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
which
in
my
view
is
the
normal
emotional
concomitant
or
expression
of
the
moral
intuition
that
the
good
of
the
whole
is
reasonably
to
be
preferred
to
the
good
of
a
part
from
the
jar
of
sympathetic
discomfort
which
attends
the
conscious
choice
of
my
own
pleasure
at
the
expense
of
pain
or
loss
to
others
but
i
find
it
impossible
to
determine
what
force
the
former
sentiment
would
have
if
actually
separated
from
the
latter
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
two
kinds
of
feeling
are
very
variously
combined
in
different
individuals
perhaps
indeed
we
may
trace
a
general
law
of
variation
in
the
relative
proportion
of
these
two
elements
as
exhibited
in
the
development
of
the
moral
consciousness
both
in
the
race
and
in
individuals
for
it
seems
that
at
a
certain
stage
of
this
development
the
mind
is
more
susceptible
to
emotions
connected
with
abstract
moral
ideas
and
rules
presented
as
absolute
while
after
emerging
from
this
stage
and
before
entering
it
the
feelings
that
belong
to
personal
relations
are
stronger
certainly
in
a
utilitarian
s
mind
sympathy
tends
to
become
a
prominent
element
of
all
instinctive
moral
feelings
that
refer
to
social
conduct
as
in
his
view
the
rational
basis
of
the
moral
impulse
must
ultimately
lie
in
some
pleasure
won
or
pain
saved
for
himself
or
for
others
so
that
he
never
has
to
sacrifice
himself
to
an
impersonal
law
but
always
for
some
being
or
beings
with
whom
he
has
at
least
some
degree
of
but
besides
admitting
the
actual
importance
of
sympathetic
pleasures
to
the
majority
of
mankind
i
should
go
further
and
maintain
that
on
empirical
grounds
alone
enlightened
would
direct
most
men
to
foster
and
develop
their
sympathetic
susceptibilities
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
now
commonly
attained
the
effectiveness
of
butler
s
famous
argument
against
the
vulgar
antithesis
between
and
benevolence
is
undeniable
and
it
seems
scarcely
extravagant
to
say
that
amid
all
the
profuse
waste
of
the
means
of
happiness
which
men
commit
there
is
no
imprudence
more
flagrant
than
that
of
selfishness
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
that
excessive
concentration
of
attention
on
the
individual
s
own
happiness
which
renders
it
impossible
for
him
to
feel
any
strong
interest
in
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
others
the
perpetual
prominence
of
self
that
hence
results
tends
to
deprive
all
enjoyments
of
their
keenness
and
zest
and
produce
rapid
satiety
and
the
selfish
man
misses
the
sense
of
elevation
and
enlargement
given
by
wide
interests
he
misses
the
more
secure
and
serene
satisfaction
that
attends
continually
on
activities
directed
towards
ends
more
stable
in
prospect
than
an
individual
s
happiness
can
be
he
misses
the
peculiar
rich
sweetness
depending
upon
a
sort
of
complex
reverberation
of
sympathy
which
is
always
found
in
services
rendered
to
those
whom
we
love
and
who
are
grateful
he
is
made
to
feel
in
a
thousand
various
ways
according
to
the
degree
of
refinement
which
his
nature
has
attained
the
discord
between
the
rhythms
of
his
own
life
and
of
that
larger
life
of
which
his
own
is
but
an
insignificant
fraction
but
allowing
all
this
it
yet
seems
to
me
as
certain
as
any
conclusion
arrived
at
by
hedonistic
comparison
can
be
that
the
utmost
development
of
sympathy
intensive
and
extensive
which
is
now
possible
to
any
but
a
very
few
exceptional
persons
would
not
cause
a
perfect
coincidence
between
utilitarian
duty
and
here
it
seems
to
me
that
what
was
said
in
book
ii
chap
to
show
the
insufficiency
of
the
conscientious
sanction
applies
equally
to
sympathy
suppose
a
man
finds
that
a
regard
for
the
general
good
utilitarian
duty
demands
from
him
a
sacrifice
or
extreme
risk
of
life
there
are
perhaps
one
or
two
human
beings
so
dear
to
him
that
the
remainder
of
a
life
saved
by
sacrificing
their
happiness
to
his
own
would
be
worthless
to
him
from
an
egoistic
point
of
view
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
many
men
sitting
down
in
a
cool
hour
to
make
the
estimate
would
affirm
even
this
and
of
course
that
particular
portion
of
the
general
happiness
for
which
one
is
called
upon
to
sacrifice
one
s
own
may
easily
be
the
happiness
of
persons
not
especially
dear
to
one
but
again
from
this
normal
limitation
of
our
keenest
and
strongest
sympathy
to
a
very
small
circle
of
human
beings
it
results
that
the
very
development
of
sympathy
may
operate
to
increase
the
weight
thrown
into
the
scale
against
utilitarian
duty
there
are
very
few
persons
however
strongly
and
widely
sympathetic
who
are
so
constituted
as
to
feel
for
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
mankind
generally
a
degree
of
sympathy
at
all
commensurate
with
their
concern
for
wife
or
children
or
lover
or
intimate
friend
and
if
any
training
of
the
affections
is
at
present
possible
which
would
materially
alter
this
proportion
in
the
general
distribution
of
our
sympathy
it
scarcely
seems
that
such
a
training
is
to
be
recommended
as
on
the
whole
felicific
and
thus
when
utilitarian
duty
calls
on
us
to
sacrifice
not
only
our
own
pleasures
but
the
happiness
of
those
we
love
to
the
general
good
the
very
sanction
on
which
utilitarianism
most
relies
must
act
powerfully
in
opposition
to
its
precepts
but
even
apart
from
these
exceptional
cases
which
are
yet
sufficient
to
decide
the
abstract
question
it
seems
that
the
course
of
conduct
by
which
a
man
would
most
fully
reap
the
rewards
of
sympathy
so
far
as
they
are
empirically
ascertainable
will
often
be
very
different
from
that
to
which
a
sincere
desire
to
promote
the
general
happiness
would
direct
him
for
the
relief
of
distress
and
calamity
is
an
important
part
of
utilitarian
duty
but
as
the
state
of
the
person
relieved
is
on
the
whole
painful
it
would
appear
that
sympathy
under
these
circumstances
must
be
a
source
of
pain
rather
than
pleasure
in
proportion
to
its
intensity
it
is
probably
true
as
a
general
rule
that
in
the
relief
of
distress
other
elements
of
the
complex
pleasure
of
benevolence
decidedly
outweigh
this
sympathetic
pain
for
the
effusion
of
pity
is
itself
pleasurable
and
we
commonly
feel
more
keenly
that
amelioration
of
the
sufferer
s
state
which
is
due
to
our
exertions
than
we
do
his
pain
otherwise
caused
and
there
is
further
the
pleasure
that
we
derive
from
his
gratitude
and
the
pleasure
that
is
the
normal
reflex
of
activity
directed
under
a
strong
impulse
towards
a
permanently
valued
end
still
when
the
distress
is
bitter
and
continued
and
such
as
we
can
only
partially
mitigate
by
all
our
efforts
the
philanthropist
s
sympathetic
discomfort
must
necessarily
be
considerable
and
the
work
of
combating
misery
though
not
devoid
of
elevated
happiness
will
be
much
less
happy
on
the
whole
than
many
other
forms
of
activity
while
yet
it
may
be
to
just
this
work
that
duty
seems
to
summon
us
or
again
a
man
may
find
that
he
can
best
promote
the
general
happiness
by
working
in
comparative
solitude
for
ends
that
he
never
hopes
to
see
realised
or
by
working
chiefly
among
and
for
persons
for
whom
he
can
not
feel
much
affection
or
by
doing
what
must
alienate
or
grieve
those
whom
he
loves
best
or
must
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
dispense
with
the
most
intimate
of
human
ties
in
short
there
seem
to
be
numberless
ways
in
which
the
dictates
of
that
rational
benevolence
which
as
a
utilitarian
he
is
bound
absolutely
to
obey
may
conflict
with
that
indulgence
of
kind
affections
which
shaftesbury
and
his
followers
so
persuasively
exhibit
as
its
own
reward
it
seems
then
that
we
must
conclude
from
the
arguments
given
in
book
ii
chap
supplemented
by
the
discussion
in
the
preceding
section
that
the
inseparable
connexion
between
utilitarian
duty
and
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
individual
who
conforms
to
it
can
not
be
satisfactorily
demonstrated
on
empirical
grounds
hence
another
section
of
the
utilitarian
school
has
preferred
to
throw
the
weight
of
duty
on
the
religious
sanction
and
this
procedure
has
been
partly
adopted
by
some
of
those
who
have
chiefly
dwelt
on
sympathy
as
a
motive
from
this
point
of
view
the
utilitarian
code
is
conceived
as
the
law
of
god
who
is
to
be
regarded
as
having
commanded
men
to
promote
the
general
happiness
and
as
having
announced
an
intention
of
rewarding
those
who
obey
his
commands
and
punishing
the
disobedient
it
is
clear
that
if
we
feel
convinced
that
an
omnipotent
being
has
in
whatever
way
signified
such
commands
and
announcements
a
rational
egoist
can
want
no
further
inducement
to
frame
his
life
on
utilitarian
principles
it
only
remains
to
consider
how
this
conviction
is
attained
this
is
commonly
thought
to
be
either
by
supernatural
revelation
or
by
the
natural
exercise
of
reason
or
in
both
ways
as
regards
the
former
it
is
to
be
observed
that
with
a
few
exceptions
the
moralists
who
hold
that
god
has
disclosed
his
law
either
to
special
individuals
in
past
ages
who
have
left
a
written
record
of
what
was
revealed
to
them
or
to
a
permanent
succession
of
persons
appointed
in
a
particular
manner
or
to
religious
persons
generally
in
some
supernatural
way
do
not
consider
that
it
is
the
utilitarian
code
that
has
thus
been
revealed
but
rather
the
rules
of
morality
with
some
special
modifications
and
additions
still
as
mill
has
urged
in
so
far
as
utilitarianism
is
more
rigorous
than
common
sense
in
exacting
the
sacrifice
of
the
individual
s
happiness
to
that
of
mankind
generally
it
is
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
most
characteristic
teaching
of
christianity
it
seems
however
unnecessary
to
discuss
the
precise
relation
of
different
revelational
codes
to
utilitarianism
as
it
would
be
going
beyond
our
province
to
investigate
the
grounds
on
which
a
divine
origin
has
been
attributed
to
them
in
so
far
however
as
a
knowledge
of
god
s
law
is
believed
to
be
attainable
by
the
reason
ethics
and
theology
seem
to
be
so
closely
connected
that
we
can
not
sharply
separate
their
provinces
for
as
we
saw
it
has
been
widely
maintained
that
the
relation
of
moral
rules
to
a
divine
lawgiver
is
implicitly
cognised
in
the
act
of
thought
by
which
we
discern
these
rules
to
be
binding
and
no
doubt
the
terms
such
as
moral
obligation
which
we
commonly
use
in
speaking
of
these
rules
are
naturally
suggestive
of
legal
sanctions
and
so
of
a
sovereign
by
whom
these
are
announced
and
enforced
indeed
many
thinkers
since
locke
have
refused
to
admit
any
other
meaning
in
the
terms
right
duty
except
that
of
a
rule
imposed
by
a
lawgiver
this
view
however
seems
opposed
to
common
sense
as
may
be
perhaps
most
easily
shown
by
pointing
out
that
the
divine
lawgiver
is
himself
conceived
as
a
moral
agent
as
prescribing
what
is
right
and
designing
what
is
good
it
is
clear
that
in
this
conception
at
least
the
notions
right
and
good
are
used
absolutely
without
any
reference
to
a
superior
lawgiver
and
that
they
are
here
used
in
a
sense
not
essentially
different
from
that
which
they
ordinarily
bear
seems
to
be
affirmed
by
the
of
religious
persons
still
though
common
sense
does
not
regard
moral
rules
as
being
the
mandates
of
an
omnipotent
being
who
will
reward
and
punish
men
according
as
they
obey
or
violate
them
it
certainly
holds
that
this
is
a
true
though
partial
view
of
them
and
perhaps
that
it
may
be
intuitively
apprehended
if
then
reflection
leads
us
to
conclude
that
the
particular
moral
principles
of
common
sense
are
to
be
systematised
as
subordinate
to
that
certain
and
irrefragable
intuition
which
stands
as
the
first
principle
of
utilitarianism
then
of
course
it
will
be
the
utilitarian
code
to
which
we
shall
believe
the
divine
sanctions
to
be
attached
or
again
we
may
argue
thus
if
as
all
theologians
agree
we
are
to
conceive
god
as
acting
for
some
end
we
must
conceive
that
end
to
be
universal
good
and
if
utilitarians
are
right
universal
happiness
and
we
can
not
suppose
that
in
a
world
morally
governed
it
can
be
prudent
for
any
man
to
act
in
conscious
opposition
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
divine
design
hence
if
in
any
case
after
calculating
the
consequences
of
two
alternatives
of
conduct
we
choose
that
which
seems
likely
to
be
less
conducive
to
happiness
generally
we
shall
be
acting
in
a
manner
for
which
we
can
not
but
expect
to
suffer
to
this
it
has
been
objected
that
observation
of
the
actual
world
shows
us
that
the
happiness
of
sentient
beings
is
so
imperfectly
attained
in
it
and
with
so
large
an
intermixture
of
pain
and
misery
that
we
can
not
really
conceive
universal
happiness
to
be
god
s
end
unless
we
admit
that
he
is
not
omnipotent
and
no
doubt
the
assertion
that
god
is
omnipotent
will
require
to
be
understood
with
some
limitation
but
perhaps
with
no
greater
limitation
than
has
always
been
implicitly
admitted
by
thoughtful
theologians
for
these
seem
always
to
have
allowed
that
some
things
are
impossible
to
god
as
for
example
to
change
the
past
and
perhaps
if
our
knowledge
of
the
universe
were
complete
we
might
discern
the
of
happiness
ultimately
attained
in
it
to
be
as
great
as
could
be
attained
without
the
accomplishment
of
what
we
should
then
see
to
be
just
as
inconceivable
and
absurd
as
changing
the
past
this
however
is
a
view
which
it
belongs
rather
to
the
theologian
to
develop
i
should
rather
urge
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
other
of
the
ordinary
interpretations
of
good
according
to
which
it
would
appear
to
be
more
completely
realised
in
the
actual
universe
for
the
wonderful
perfections
of
work
that
we
admire
in
the
physical
world
are
yet
everywhere
mingled
with
imperfection
and
subject
to
destruction
and
decay
and
similarly
in
the
world
of
human
conduct
virtue
is
at
least
as
much
balanced
by
vice
as
happiness
is
by
misery
so
that
if
the
ethical
reasoning
that
led
us
to
interpret
ultimate
good
as
happiness
is
sound
there
seems
no
argument
from
natural
theology
to
set
against
it
if
then
we
may
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
being
as
god
by
the
of
theologians
is
conceived
to
be
it
seems
that
utilitarians
may
legitimately
infer
the
existence
of
divine
sanctions
to
the
code
of
social
duty
as
constructed
on
a
utilitarian
basis
and
such
sanctions
would
of
course
suffice
to
make
it
always
every
one
s
interest
to
promote
universal
happiness
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
it
is
however
desirable
before
we
conclude
to
examine
carefully
the
validity
of
this
assumption
in
so
far
as
it
is
supported
on
ethical
grounds
alone
for
by
the
result
of
such
an
examination
will
be
determined
as
we
now
see
the
very
important
question
whether
ethical
science
can
be
constructed
on
an
independent
basis
or
whether
it
is
forced
to
borrow
a
fundamental
and
indispensable
premiss
from
theology
or
some
similar
source
in
order
fairly
to
perform
this
examination
let
us
reflect
upon
the
clearest
and
most
certain
of
our
moral
intuitions
i
find
that
i
undoubtedly
seem
to
perceive
as
clearly
and
certainly
as
i
see
any
axiom
in
arithmetic
or
geometry
that
it
is
right
and
reasonable
for
me
to
treat
others
as
i
should
think
that
i
myself
ought
to
be
treated
under
similar
conditions
and
to
do
what
i
believe
to
be
ultimately
conducive
to
universal
good
or
happiness
but
i
can
not
find
inseparably
connected
with
this
conviction
and
similarly
attainable
by
mere
reflective
intuition
any
cognition
that
there
actually
is
a
supreme
being
who
will
adequately
reward
me
for
obeying
these
rules
of
duty
or
punish
me
for
violating
them
or
omitting
the
strictly
theological
element
of
the
proposition
i
may
say
that
i
do
not
find
in
my
moral
consciousness
any
intuition
claiming
to
be
clear
and
certain
that
the
performance
of
duty
will
be
adequately
rewarded
and
its
violation
punished
i
feel
indeed
a
desire
apparently
inseparable
from
the
moral
sentiments
that
this
result
may
be
realised
not
only
in
my
own
case
but
universally
but
the
mere
existence
of
the
desire
would
not
go
far
to
establish
the
probability
of
its
fulfilment
considering
the
large
proportion
of
human
desires
that
experience
shows
to
be
doomed
to
disappointment
i
also
judge
that
in
a
certain
sense
this
result
to
be
realised
in
this
judgment
however
ought
is
not
used
in
a
strictly
ethical
meaning
it
only
expresses
the
vital
need
that
our
practical
reason
feels
of
proving
or
postulating
this
connexion
of
virtue
and
if
it
is
to
be
made
consistent
with
itself
for
the
negation
of
the
connexion
must
force
us
to
admit
an
ultimate
and
fundamental
contradiction
in
our
apparent
intuitions
of
what
is
reasonable
in
conduct
and
from
this
admission
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
the
apparently
intuitive
operation
of
the
practical
reason
manifested
in
these
contradictory
judgments
is
after
all
illusory
i
do
not
mean
that
if
we
gave
up
the
hope
of
attaining
a
practical
solution
of
this
fundamental
contradiction
through
any
legitimately
obtained
conclusion
or
postulate
as
to
the
moral
order
of
the
world
it
would
become
reasonable
for
us
to
abandon
morality
altogether
but
it
would
seem
necessary
to
abandon
the
idea
of
rationalising
it
completely
we
should
doubtless
still
not
only
from
but
also
through
sympathy
and
sentiments
protective
of
social
wellbeing
imparted
by
education
and
sustained
by
communication
with
other
men
feel
a
desire
for
the
general
observance
of
rules
conducive
to
general
happiness
and
practical
reason
would
still
impel
us
decisively
to
the
performance
of
duty
in
the
more
ordinary
cases
in
which
what
is
recognised
as
duty
is
in
harmony
with
properly
understood
but
in
the
rarer
cases
of
a
recognised
conflict
between
and
duty
practical
reason
being
divided
against
itself
would
cease
to
be
a
motive
on
either
side
the
conflict
would
have
to
be
decided
by
the
comparative
preponderance
of
one
or
other
of
two
groups
of
impulses
if
then
the
reconciliation
of
duty
and
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
hypothesis
logically
necessary
to
avoid
a
fundamental
contradiction
in
one
chief
department
of
our
thought
it
remains
to
ask
how
far
this
necessity
constitutes
a
sufficient
reason
for
accepting
this
hypothesis
this
however
is
a
profoundly
difficult
and
controverted
question
the
discussion
of
which
belongs
rather
to
a
treatise
on
general
philosophy
than
to
a
work
on
the
methods
of
ethics
as
it
could
not
be
satisfactorily
answered
without
a
general
examination
of
the
criteria
of
true
and
false
beliefs
those
who
hold
that
the
edifice
of
physical
science
is
really
constructed
of
conclusions
logically
inferred
from
premises
may
reasonably
demand
that
any
practical
judgments
claiming
philosophic
certainty
should
be
based
on
an
equally
firm
foundation
if
on
the
other
hand
we
find
that
in
our
supposed
knowledge
of
the
world
of
nature
propositions
are
commonly
taken
to
be
universally
true
which
yet
seem
to
rest
on
no
other
grounds
than
that
we
have
a
strong
disposition
to
accept
them
and
that
they
are
indispensable
to
the
systematic
coherence
of
our
beliefs
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
reject
a
similarly
supported
assumption
in
ethics
without
opening
the
door
to
universal
scepticism
footnotes
see
mill
s
treatise
on
utilitarianism
chap
iii
passim
where
however
the
argument
is
not
easy
to
follow
from
a
confusion
between
three
different
objects
of
inquiry
the
actual
effect
of
sympathy
in
inducing
conformity
to
the
rules
of
utilitarian
ethics
the
effect
in
this
direction
which
it
is
likely
to
have
in
the
future
the
value
of
sympathetic
pleasures
and
pains
as
estimated
by
an
enlightened
egoist
the
first
and
third
of
these
questions
mill
did
not
clearly
separate
owing
to
his
psychological
doctrine
that
each
one
s
own
pleasure
is
the
sole
object
of
his
desires
but
if
my
refutation
of
this
doctrine
book
chap
iv
is
valid
we
have
to
distinguish
two
ways
in
which
sympathy
operates
it
generates
sympathetic
pleasures
and
pains
which
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
calculations
of
egoistic
hedonism
but
it
also
may
cause
impulses
to
altruistic
action
of
which
the
force
is
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
sympathetic
pleasure
or
relief
from
pain
which
such
action
seems
likely
to
secure
to
the
agent
so
that
even
if
the
average
man
ever
should
reach
such
a
pitch
of
sympathetic
development
as
never
to
feel
prompted
to
sacrifice
the
general
good
to
his
own
still
this
will
not
prove
that
it
is
egoistically
reasonable
for
him
to
behave
in
this
way
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
process
of
change
is
merely
circular
in
the
earlier
period
sympathy
is
narrower
simpler
and
more
presentative
in
the
later
it
is
more
extensive
complex
and
representative
i
do
not
however
think
that
we
are
justified
in
stating
as
true
what
has
been
admitted
in
the
preceding
paragraph
some
few
thoroughly
selfish
persons
appear
at
least
to
be
happier
than
most
of
the
unselfish
and
there
are
other
exceptional
natures
whose
chief
happiness
seems
to
be
derived
from
activity
disinterested
indeed
but
directed
towards
other
ends
than
human
happiness

it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
this
comparison
has
no
force
for
libertarians
who
consider
the
essence
of
virtue
to
lie
in
free
choice
but
to
say
that
free
choice
is
virtuous
would
be
a
paradox
from
which
most
libertarians
admitting
that
evil
may
be
freely
chosen
no
less
than
good
would
recoil
it
must
therefore
be
free
choice
of
good
that
is
conceived
to
realise
the
divine
end
and
if
so
the
arguments
for
the
utilitarian
interpretation
of
good
thus
freely
chosen
would
still
be
applicable
and
if
so
the
arguments
for
regarding
rules
of
utilitarian
duty
as
divinely
sanctioned
would
be
similarly
applicable
it
is
not
necessary
if
we
are
simply
considering
ethics
as
a
possible
independent
science
to
throw
the
fundamental
premiss
of
which
we
are
now
examining
the
validity
into
a
theistic
form
nor
does
it
seem
always
to
have
taken
that
form
in
the
support
which
positive
religion
has
given
to
morality
in
the
buddhist
creed
this
notion
of
the
rewards
inseparably
attaching
to
right
conduct
seems
to
have
been
developed
in
a
far
more
elaborate
and
systematic
manner
than
it
has
in
any
phase
of
christianity
but
as
conceived
by
enlightened
buddhists
these
rewards
are
not
distributed
by
the
volition
of
a
supreme
person
but
by
the
natural
operation
of
an
impersonal
law
it
may
be
well
to
remind
the
reader
that
by
adequate
is
here
meant
sufficient
to
make
it
the
agent
s
interest
to
promote
universal
good
not
necessarily
proportional
to
i
can
not
fall
back
on
the
resource
of
thinking
myself
under
a
moral
necessity
to
regard
all
my
duties
if
were
commandments
of
god
although
not
entitled
to
hold
speculatively
that
any
such
supreme
being
really
exists
i
am
so
far
from
feeling
bound
to
believe
for
purposes
of
practice
what
i
see
no
ground
for
holding
as
a
speculative
truth
that
i
can
not
even
conceive
the
state
of
mind
which
these
words
seem
to
describe
except
as
a
momentary
irrationality
committed
in
a
violent
access
of
philosophic
despair
appendix
the
kantian
conception
of
free
will
with
some
omissions
mind
no
my
aim
is
to
show
that
in
different
parts
of
kant
s
exposition
of
his
doctrine
two
essentially
different
conceptions
are
expressed
by
the
same
word
freedom
while
yet
kant
does
not
appear
to
be
conscious
of
any
variation
in
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
the
one
sense
freedom
rationality
so
that
a
man
is
free
in
proportion
as
he
acts
in
accordance
with
reason
i
do
not
in
the
least
object
to
this
use
of
the
term
freedom
on
account
of
its
deviation
from
ordinary
usage
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
has
much
support
in
men
s
natural
expression
of
ordinary
moral
experience
in
discourse
in
the
conflict
that
is
continually
going
on
in
all
of
us
between
impulses
and
what
we
recognise
as
dictates
of
practical
reason
we
are
in
the
habit
of
identifying
ourselves
with
the
latter
rather
than
with
the
former
as
whewell
says
we
speak
of
desire
love
anger
as
mastering
us
and
of
ourselves
as
controlling
them
we
continually
call
men
slaves
of
appetite
or
passion
whereas
no
one
was
ever
called
a
slave
of
reason
if
therefore
the
term
freedom
had
not
already
been
appropriated
by
moralists
to
another
meaning
if
it
were
merely
a
question
of
taking
it
from
ordinary
discourse
and
stamping
it
with
greater
precision
for
purposes
of
ethical
discussion
i
should
make
no
objection
to
the
statement
that
a
man
is
a
free
agent
in
proportion
as
he
acts
but
what
english
defenders
of
man
s
free
agency
have
generally
been
concerned
to
maintain
is
that
man
has
a
freedom
of
between
good
and
evil
which
is
realised
or
manifested
when
he
deliberately
chooses
evil
just
as
much
as
when
he
deliberately
chooses
good
and
it
is
clear
that
if
we
say
that
a
man
is
a
free
agent
in
proportion
as
he
acts
rationally
we
can
not
also
say
in
the
same
sense
of
the
term
that
it
is
by
his
free
choice
that
he
acts
irrationally
when
he
does
so
act
the
notions
of
freedom
must
be
admitted
to
be
fundamentally
different
in
the
two
statements
and
though
usage
might
fairly
allow
the
word
freedom
to
represent
either
notion
if
only
one
or
other
of
the
propositions
were
affirmed
to
use
it
to
represent
both
in
affirming
both
propositions
is
obviously
inconvenient
and
it
implies
a
confusion
of
thought
so
to
use
it
without
pointing
out
the
difference
of
meaning
if
this
be
admitted
the
next
thing
is
to
show
that
kant
does
use
the
term
in
this
double
way
in
arguing
this
it
will
be
convenient
to
have
names
for
what
we
admit
to
be
two
distinct
ideas
accordingly
the
kind
of
freedom
which
i
first
mentioned
which
a
man
is
said
to
manifest
more
in
proportion
as
he
acts
more
under
the
guidance
of
reason
shall
be
referred
to
as
good
or
rational
freedom
and
the
freedom
that
is
manifested
in
choosing
between
good
and
evil
shall
be
called
neutral
or
moral
but
before
i
proceed
to
the
different
passages
of
kant
s
exposition
in
which
good
freedom
and
neutral
freedom
respectively
occur
it
seems
desirable
to
distinguish
this
latter
from
a
wider
notion
with
which
it
may
possibly
be
confounded
and
which
it
would
be
clearly
wrong
to
attribute
to
kant
i
mean
the
power
of
acting
without
a
motive
which
reid
and
other
writers
on
what
used
to
be
called
the
libertarian
side
have
thought
it
necessary
to
claim
if
a
man
could
not
act
without
a
motive
says
reid
he
could
have
no
power
that
is
in
reid
s
meaning
no
free
agency
at
this
conception
of
freedom
which
i
may
conveniently
distinguish
as
capricious
freedom
is
as
i
said
certainly
not
kantian
not
only
does
he
expressly
repudiate
it
but
nowhere
so
far
as
i
know
does
he
unconsciously
introduce
it
indeed
it
is
incompatible
with
any
and
every
part
of
his
explanation
of
human
volition
the
originality
and
interest
of
his
defence
of
neutral
freedom
the
power
of
choice
between
good
and
evil
lies
in
its
complete
avoidance
of
capricious
freedom
or
the
power
of
acting
without
a
motive
any
particular
this
distinction
helps
me
to
understand
how
it
is
that
many
intelligent
readers
have
failed
to
see
in
kant
s
exposition
the
two
freedoms
good
or
rational
freedom
and
neutral
or
moral
freedom
which
i
find
in
kant
they
have
their
view
fixed
on
the
difference
between
rational
or
moral
freedom
which
kant
maintains
and
the
freedom
of
caprice
which
he
undoubtedly
repudiates
and
are
thus
led
to
overlook
with
him
the
distinction
between
the
freedom
that
we
realise
or
manifest
in
proportion
as
we
do
right
and
the
freedom
that
is
realised
or
manifested
equally
in
choosing
either
right
or
wrong
when
we
have
once
put
completely
out
of
view
the
freedom
of
caprice
the
power
of
acting
without
a
motive
or
against
the
strongest
motive
when
the
competition
is
among
merely
natural
or
desires
or
aversions
when
we
have
agreed
to
exclude
this
and
to
concentrate
attention
on
the
difference
between
good
freedom
and
neutral
freedom
i
venture
to
think
that
no
one
can
avoid
seeing
each
member
of
this
latter
antithesis
in
kant
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
as
he
does
not
himself
distinguish
the
two
conceptions
it
is
naturally
impossible
for
the
most
careful
reader
always
to
tell
which
is
to
be
understood
but
there
are
many
passages
where
his
argument
unmistakably
requires
the
one
and
many
other
passages
where
it
unmistakably
requires
the
other
speaking
broadly
i
may
say
that
wherever
kant
has
to
connect
the
notion
of
freedom
with
that
of
moral
responsibility
or
moral
imputation
he
like
all
other
moralists
who
have
maintained
free
will
in
this
connexion
means
chiefly
but
not
solely
neutral
freedom
freedom
exhibited
in
choosing
wrong
as
much
as
in
choosing
right
indeed
in
such
passages
it
is
with
the
freedom
of
the
that
he
is
primarily
concerned
since
it
is
the
that
he
especially
wishes
to
prevent
from
shifting
his
responsibility
on
to
causes
beyond
his
control
on
the
other
hand
when
what
he
has
to
prove
is
the
possibility
of
disinterested
obedience
to
law
as
such
without
the
intervention
of
sensible
impulses
when
he
seeks
to
exhibit
the
independence
of
reason
in
influencing
choice
then
in
many
though
not
all
his
statements
he
explicitly
identifies
freedom
with
this
independence
of
reason
and
thus
clearly
implies
the
proposition
that
a
man
is
free
in
proportion
as
he
acts
rationally
as
an
example
of
the
first
kind
i
will
take
the
passage
towards
the
close
of
chap
iii
of
the
analytic
of
practical
reason
where
he
treats
in
its
bearing
on
moral
responsibility
his
peculiar
metaphysical
doctrine
of
a
double
kind
of
causation
in
human
actions
according
to
kant
every
such
action
regarded
as
a
phenomenon
determined
in
time
must
be
thought
as
a
necessary
result
of
determining
causes
in
antecedent
time
otherwise
its
existence
would
be
inconceivable
but
it
may
be
also
regarded
in
relation
to
the
agent
considered
as
a
as
the
noümenon
of
which
the
action
is
a
phenomenon
and
the
conception
of
freedom
may
be
applied
to
the
agent
so
considered
in
relation
to
his
phenomena
for
since
his
existence
as
a
noümenon
is
not
subject
to
nothing
in
this
noümenal
existence
comes
under
the
principle
of
determination
by
antecedent
causes
hence
as
kant
says
in
this
his
existence
nothing
is
antecedent
to
the
determination
of
his
will
but
every
action
even
the
whole
series
of
his
existence
as
a
sensible
being
is
in
the
consciousness
of
his
supersensible
existence
nothing
but
the
result
of
his
causality
as
a
this
is
the
metaphysical
solution
of
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
free
will
with
the
universality
of
physical
causation
i
am
not
now
concerned
to
criticise
it
my
point
is
that
if
we
accept
this
view
of
freedom
at
all
it
must
obviously
be
neutral
freedom
it
must
express
the
relation
of
a
noümenon
that
manifests
itself
as
a
scoundrel
to
a
series
of
bad
volitions
in
which
the
moral
law
is
violated
no
less
than
the
relation
of
a
noümenon
that
manifests
itself
as
a
saint
to
good
or
rational
volitions
in
which
the
moral
law
or
categorical
imperative
is
obeyed
and
as
i
before
said
kant
in
this
passage
being
especially
concerned
to
explain
the
possibility
of
moral
imputation
and
justify
the
judicial
sentences
of
conscience
especially
takes
as
his
illustrations
noümena
that
exhibit
bad
phenomena
the
question
he
expressly
raises
is
how
a
man
who
commits
a
theft
can
be
called
quite
free
at
the
moment
of
committing
it
and
answers
that
it
is
in
virtue
of
his
transcendental
freedom
that
the
rational
being
can
justly
say
of
unlawful
that
he
performs
that
he
could
very
well
have
left
it
undone
although
as
phenomenon
it
is
determined
by
antecedents
and
so
necessary
for
it
with
all
the
past
which
determines
it
belongs
to
the
one
single
phenomenon
of
his
character
which
he
makes
for
himself
in
consequence
of
which
he
imputes
to
himself
the
bad
actions
that
result
necessarily
from
his
bad
character
taken
in
conjunction
with
other
causes
hence
however
he
may
account
for
his
error
from
bad
habits
which
he
has
allowed
to
grow
on
him
whatever
art
he
may
use
to
paint
to
himself
an
unlawful
act
he
remembers
as
something
in
which
he
was
carried
away
by
the
stream
of
physical
necessity
this
can
not
protect
him
from
not
even
if
he
have
shown
depravity
so
early
that
he
may
reasonably
be
thought
to
have
been
born
in
a
morally
hopeless
condition
he
will
still
be
rightly
judged
and
will
judge
himself
just
as
responsible
as
any
other
man
since
in
relation
to
his
noümenal
self
his
life
as
a
whole
from
first
to
last
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
single
phenomenon
resulting
from
an
absolutely
free
choice
i
need
not
labour
this
point
further
it
is
evident
that
the
necessities
of
kant
s
metaphysical
explanation
of
moral
responsibility
make
him
express
with
peculiar
emphasis
and
fulness
the
notion
of
what
i
have
called
neutral
freedom
a
kind
of
causality
manifested
in
bad
and
irrational
volitions
no
less
than
in
the
good
and
rational
on
the
other
hand
it
is
no
less
easy
to
find
passages
in
which
the
term
freedom
seems
to
me
most
distinctly
to
stand
for
good
or
rational
freedom
indeed
such
passages
are
i
think
more
frequent
than
those
in
which
the
other
meaning
is
plainly
required
thus
he
tells
us
that
a
free
will
must
find
its
principle
of
determination
in
the
moral
law
and
that
freedom
whose
causality
can
be
determined
only
by
the
law
consists
just
in
this
that
it
restricts
all
inclinations
by
the
condition
of
obedience
to
pure
whereas
in
the
argument
previously
examined
his
whole
effort
was
to
prove
that
the
noümenon
or
supersensible
being
of
which
each
volition
is
a
phenomenon
exercises
free
causality
in
unlawful
acts
he
tells
us
elsewhere
in
the
same
treatise
that
the
supersensible
nature
of
rational
beings
who
have
also
a
sensible
nature
is
their
existence
according
to
laws
which
are
independent
of
every
empirical
condition
and
therefore
belong
to
the
autonomy
of
pure
practical
similarly
in
an
earlier
work
he
explains
that
since
the
conception
of
causality
involves
that
of
laws
though
freedom
is
not
a
property
of
the
will
depending
on
physical
laws
yet
it
is
not
for
that
reason
lawless
on
the
contrary
it
must
be
a
causality
according
to
immutable
laws
but
of
a
peculiar
kind
otherwise
a
free
will
would
be
a
chimæra
and
this
immutable
law
of
the
free
or
autonomous
will
is
as
he
goes
on
to
say
the
fundamental
principle
of
morality
so
that
a
free
will
and
a
will
subject
to
moral
laws
are
one
and
the
i
have
quoted
this
last
phrase
not
because
it
clearly
exhibits
the
notion
of
rational
freedom
on
the
contrary
it
rather
shows
how
easily
this
notion
may
be
confounded
with
the
other
a
will
subject
to
its
own
moral
laws
mean
a
will
that
so
far
as
free
conforms
to
these
laws
but
it
also
be
conceived
as
capable
of
freely
disobeying
these
laws
exercising
neutral
freedom
but
when
freedom
is
said
to
be
a
causality
according
to
immutable
laws
the
ambiguity
is
dispelled
for
this
evidently
can
not
mean
merely
a
faculty
of
laying
down
laws
which
may
or
may
not
be
obeyed
it
must
mean
that
the
will
free
acts
in
accordance
with
these
laws
the
human
being
doubtless
often
acts
contrary
to
them
but
then
according
to
this
view
its
choice
in
such
actions
is
determined
not
freely
but
mechanically
by
physical
and
empirical
springs
of
action
if
any
further
argument
is
necessary
to
show
that
kantian
freedom
must
sometimes
be
understood
as
rational
or
good
freedom
i
may
quote
one
or
two
of
the
numerous
passages
in
which
kant
either
expressly
or
by
implication
identifies
will
and
reason
for
this
identification
obviously
excludes
the
possibility
of
will
s
choosing
between
reason
and
impulses
thus
in
the
zur
metaphysik
der
he
tells
us
that
as
reason
is
required
to
deduce
actions
from
laws
will
is
nothing
but
pure
practical
reason
and
similarly
in
the
der
praktischen
he
speaks
of
the
objective
reality
of
a
pure
will
or
is
the
same
a
pure
practical
accordingly
whereas
in
some
passages
the
autonomy
which
he
identifies
with
freedom
is
spoken
of
as
autonomy
of
in
others
we
are
told
that
the
moral
law
expresses
nothing
else
than
autonomy
of
the
pure
practical
that
is
i
think
that
i
have
now
established
the
verbal
ambiguity
that
i
undertook
to
bring
home
to
kant
s
account
of
free
will
i
have
shown
that
in
his
exposition
this
fundamental
term
oscillates
between
incompatible
meanings
but
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
the
defect
thus
pointed
out
can
be
cured
by
a
merely
verbal
correction
that
the
substance
of
kant
s
ethical
doctrine
may
still
be
maintained
and
may
still
be
connected
with
his
metaphysical
doctrine
it
may
still
be
held
that
reason
dictates
that
we
should
at
all
times
act
from
a
maxim
that
we
can
will
to
be
a
universal
law
and
that
we
should
do
this
from
pure
regard
for
reason
and
reason
s
law
admitting
that
it
is
a
law
which
we
are
free
to
disobey
and
it
may
still
be
held
that
the
reality
of
this
moral
freedom
is
to
be
reconciled
with
the
universality
of
physical
causation
by
conceiving
it
as
a
relation
between
the
agent
s
noümenal
self
independent
of
and
his
character
as
manifested
in
time
the
only
correction
required
being
to
avoid
identifying
freedom
and
goodness
or
rationality
as
attributes
of
agents
or
actions
i
should
quite
admit
that
the
most
important
parts
both
of
kant
s
doctrine
of
morality
and
of
his
doctrine
of
freedom
may
be
saved
or
i
should
perhaps
rather
say
that
the
latter
may
be
left
to
conduct
an
unequal
struggle
with
the
modern
notions
of
heredity
and
evolution
at
any
rate
i
admit
that
it
is
not
fundamentally
affected
by
my
present
argument
but
i
think
that
a
good
deal
more
will
have
to
go
from
a
corrected
edition
of
kantism
than
merely
the
word
freedom
in
certain
passages
if
the
confusion
introduced
by
the
ambiguity
of
this
word
is
to
be
eliminated
in
the
manner
that
i
have
suggested
i
think
that
the
whole
topic
of
the
heteronomy
of
the
will
when
it
yields
to
empirical
or
sensible
impulses
will
have
to
be
abandoned
or
profoundly
modified
and
i
am
afraid
that
most
readers
of
kant
will
feel
the
loss
to
be
serious
since
nothing
in
kant
s
ethical
writing
is
more
fascinating
than
the
idea
which
he
expresses
repeatedly
in
various
forms
that
a
man
realises
the
aim
of
his
true
self
when
he
obeys
the
moral
law
whereas
when
he
wrongly
allows
his
action
to
be
determined
by
empirical
or
sensible
stimuli
he
becomes
subject
to
physical
causation
to
laws
of
a
brute
outer
world
but
if
we
dismiss
the
identification
of
freedom
and
rationality
and
accept
definitely
and
singly
kant
s
other
notion
of
freedom
as
expressing
the
relation
of
the
human
to
its
phenomenon
i
am
afraid
that
this
appeal
to
the
sentiment
of
liberty
must
be
dismissed
as
idle
rhetoric
for
the
life
of
the
saint
must
be
as
much
subject
in
any
particular
portion
of
it
to
the
necessary
laws
of
physical
causation
as
the
life
of
the
scoundrel
and
the
scoundrel
must
exhibit
and
express
his
characteristic
in
his
transcendental
choice
of
a
bad
life
as
much
as
the
saint
does
in
his
transcendental
choice
of
a
good
one
if
on
the
other
hand
to
avoid
this
result
we
take
the
other
horn
of
the
dilemma
and
identify
inner
freedom
with
rationality
than
a
more
serious
excision
will
be
required
for
along
with
neutral
or
moral
freedom
the
whole
kantian
view
of
the
relation
of
the
noümenon
to
the
empirical
character
will
have
to
be
dropped
and
with
it
must
go
the
whole
kantian
method
of
maintaining
moral
responsibility

moral
imputation
