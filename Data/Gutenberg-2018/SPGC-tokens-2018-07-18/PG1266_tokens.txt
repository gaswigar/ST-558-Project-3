some

who
loved

xvii
dawn
i
the
light
in
the
window
a
rickety
carriage
was
slowly
ascending
the
hill
and
from
the
place
of
honour
on
the
back
seat
the
single
passenger
surveyed
the
country
with
interest
and
admiration
the
driver
of
that
ancient
chariot
was
an
awkward
young
fellow
possibly
years
of
age
with
sharp
knees
large
red
hands
high
and
abundant
hair
of
a
shade
verging
upon
orange
he
was
not
unpleasant
to
look
upon
however
for
he
had
a
certain
evident
honesty
and
he
was
disposed
to
be
friendly
to
every
one
be
you
comfortable
miss
he
asked
with
apparent
solicitude
very
comfortable
thank
you
was
the
quiet
response
he
urged
his
venerable
steeds
to
a
gait
of
about
two
miles
an
hour
then
turned
sideways
be
you
goin
to
stay
long
miss
all
summer
i
do
tell
the
young
woman
smiled
in
listless
amusement
but
joe
took
it
for
conversational
encouragement
city
folks
is
dretful
bashful
when
away
from
home
he
said
to
himself
he
clucked
again
to
his
unheeding
horses
shifted
his
quid
and
was
casting
about
for
a
new
topic
when
a
light
broke
in
upon
him
i
guess
now
that
you
miss
hathaway
niece
what
come
to
stay
in
her
house
while
she
goes
gallivantin
and
travellin
in
furrin
parts
be
you
i
am
miss
hathaway
niece
and
i
have
never
been
here
before
where
does
she
live
up
he
flourished
the
discarded
which
served
as
a
whip
and
pointed
out
a
small
white
house
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
reflection
brought
him
the
conviction
that
his
remark
concerning
miss
hathaway
was
a
social
mistake
since
his
passenger
sat
very
straight
and
asked
no
more
questions
the
weary
wheels
creaked
but
the
collapse
which
miss
thorne
momentarily
expected
was
mercifully
postponed
being
gifted
with
imagination
she
experienced
the
emotion
of
a
wreck
without
bodily
harm
as
in
a
photograph
she
beheld
herself
suddenly
projected
into
space
followed
by
her
suit
case
felt
her
new
hat
wrenched
from
her
head
and
saw
hopeless
gravel
stains
upon
the
tailored
gown
which
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
she
thought
a
sprained
ankle
would
be
the
inevitable
outcome
of
the
fall
but
was
spared
the
pain
of
it
for
the
inability
to
realise
an
actual
hurt
is
the
redeeming
feature
of
imagination
suddenly
there
was
a
snort
of
terror
from
one
of
the
horses
and
the
carriage
stopped
abruptly
ruth
clutched
her
suit
case
and
umbrella
instantly
prepared
for
the
worst
but
joe
reassured
her
now
do
you
go
and
get
skeered
miss
he
said
kindly
nothin
in
the
world
but
a
rabbit
mamie
ca
never
get
used
to
rabbits
he
indicated
one
of
the
horses
a
high
animal
sketched
on
a
generous
plan
whose
ribs
and
joints
protruded
and
whose
rough
white
coat
had
been
to
grey
hush
now
mamie
he
said
mamie
looked
around
inquiringly
with
one
ear
erect
and
the
other
at
an
angle
a
cataract
partially
concealed
one
eye
but
in
the
other
was
a
world
of
wickedness
and
knowledge
modified
by
a
certain
reserve
g
long
mamie
ruth
laughed
as
the
horse
resumed
motion
in
mincing
maidenly
steps
what
the
other
one
name
she
asked
him
his
name
alfred
mamie
his
miss
thorne
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
amusement
and
joe
was
pleased
because
the
ice
was
broken
i
change
their
names
every
once
in
a
while
he
said
it
makes
some
variety
but
now
i
about
all
the
names
i
the
road
wound
upward
in
its
own
lazy
fashion
and
there
were
trees
at
the
left
though
only
one
or
two
shaded
the
hill
itself
as
they
approached
the
summit
a
girl
in
a
blue
gingham
dress
and
a
neat
white
apron
came
out
to
meet
them
come
right
in
miss
thorne
she
said
and
i
explain
it
to
ruth
descended
inwardly
vowing
that
she
would
ride
no
more
in
carriage
and
after
giving
some
directions
about
her
trunk
followed
her
guide
indoors
the
house
was
certainly
entitled
to
the
respect
accorded
to
age
it
was
substantial
but
unpretentious
in
outline
and
had
not
been
painted
for
a
long
time
the
faded
green
shutters
blended
harmoniously
with
the
greyish
white
background
and
the
piazza
which
was
evidently
an
unhappy
afterthought
of
the
architect
had
two
or
three
new
shingles
on
its
roof
you
see
it
this
way
miss
thorne
the
maid
began
volubly
miss
hathaway
she
went
earlier
than
she
laid
out
to
on
account
of
the
folks
decidin
to
take
a
steamer
that
sailed
beforehand
before
the
other
one
i
mean
she
went
in
sech
a
hurry
that
she
did
have
time
to
send
you
word
and
get
an
answer
but
she
left
a
letter
here
for
you
for
she
trusted
to
your
miss
thorne
laid
her
hat
and
jacket
aside
and
settled
herself
comfortably
in
a
rocker
the
maid
returned
presently
with
a
letter
which
miss
hathaway
had
sealed
with
half
an
ounce
of
red
wax
presumably
in
a
laudable
effort
to
remove
temptation
from
the
path
of
the
wholesome
farmer
daughter
who
stood
near
by
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
miss
ruth
thorne
the
letter
began
dear
niece
i
am
writing
this
in
a
hurry
as
we
are
going
a
week
before
we
expected
to
i
think
you
will
find
everything
all
right
hepsey
will
attend
to
the
for
i
do
suppose
you
know
much
about
it
coming
from
the
city
she
a
girl
but
she
set
in
her
ways
and
you
have
to
kinder
give
in
to
her
but
any
time
when
you
ca
just
speak
to
her
sharp
and
she
do
as
you
tell
her
i
have
left
money
enough
for
the
expenses
until
i
come
back
in
a
little
box
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
closet
in
the
front
room
under
a
pile
of
blankets
and
comfortables
the
key
that
unlocks
it
is
hung
on
a
nail
driven
into
the
back
of
the
old
bureau
in
the
attic
i
believe
hepsey
is
honest
and
reliable
but
i
do
believe
in
tempting
folks
when
i
get
anywhere
where
i
can
i
will
write
and
send
you
my
address
and
then
you
can
tell
me
how
things
are
going
at
home
the
catnip
is
hanging
from
the
rafters
in
the
attic
in
case
you
should
want
some
tea
and
the
sassafras
is
in
the
little
drawer
in
the
bureau
that
got
the
key
hanging
behind
it
if
there
anything
else
you
should
want
i
reckon
hepsey
will
know
where
to
find
it
hoping
that
this
will
find
you
enjoying
the
great
blessing
of
good
health
i
remain
your
affectionate
aunt
jane
hathaway
p
you
have
to
keep
a
lamp
burning
every
night
in
the
east
window
of
the
attic
be
careful
that
nothing
catches
the
maid
was
waiting
in
fear
and
trembling
for
she
did
not
know
what
directions
her
eccentric
mistress
might
have
left
everything
is
all
right
hepsey
said
miss
thorne
pleasantly
and
i
think
you
and
i
will
get
along
nicely
did
miss
hathaway
tell
you
what
room
i
was
to
have
no
she
told
me
you
was
to
make
yourself
at
home
she
said
you
could
sleep
where
you
very
well
i
will
go
up
and
see
for
myself
i
would
like
my
tea
at
six
she
still
held
the
letter
in
her
hand
greatly
to
the
chagrin
of
hepsey
who
was
interested
in
everything
and
had
counted
upon
a
peep
at
it
it
was
not
miss
hathaway
custom
to
guard
her
letters
and
she
was
both
surprised
and
disappointed
as
ruth
climbed
the
narrow
stairway
the
quiet
house
brought
balm
to
her
tired
soul
it
was
exquisitely
clean
redolent
of
sweet
herbs
and
in
its
atmosphere
was
a
subtle
puritan
restraint
have
not
our
houses
mute
as
they
are
their
own
way
of
conveying
an
impression
one
may
go
into
a
house
which
has
been
empty
for
a
long
time
and
yet
feel
instinctively
what
sort
of
people
were
last
sheltered
there
the
silent
walls
breathe
a
message
to
each
visitor
and
as
the
footfalls
echo
in
the
bare
cheerless
rooms
one
discovers
where
sorrow
and
trouble
had
their
abode
and
where
the
light
careless
laughter
of
gay
bohemia
lingered
until
dawn
at
night
who
has
not
heard
ghostly
steps
upon
the
stairs
the
soft
closing
of
unseen
doors
the
tapping
on
a
window
and
perchance
a
sigh
or
the
sound
of
tears
timid
souls
may
shudder
and
be
afraid
but
wiser
folk
smile
with
reminiscent
tenderness
when
the
old
house
dreams
as
she
wandered
through
the
tiny
spotless
rooms
on
the
second
floor
of
miss
hathaway
house
ruth
had
a
sense
of
security
and
peace
which
she
had
never
known
before
there
were
two
front
rooms
of
equal
size
looking
to
the
west
and
she
chose
the
one
on
the
left
because
of
its
two
south
windows
there
was
but
one
other
room
aside
from
the
small
one
at
the
end
of
the
hall
which
as
she
supposed
was
hepsey
one
of
the
closets
was
empty
but
on
a
shelf
in
the
other
was
a
great
pile
of
bedding
she
dragged
a
chair
inside
burrowed
under
the
blankets
and
found
a
small
wooden
box
the
contents
clinking
softly
as
she
drew
it
toward
her
holding
it
under
her
arm
she
ascended
the
narrow
spiral
stairs
which
led
to
the
attic
at
one
end
under
the
eaves
stood
an
old
mahogany
dresser
the
casters
were
gone
and
she
moved
it
with
difficulty
but
the
slanting
sunbeams
of
late
afternoon
revealed
the
key
which
hung
as
her
aunt
had
written
on
a
nail
driven
into
the
back
of
it
she
knew
without
trying
that
it
would
fit
the
box
but
idly
turned
the
lock
as
she
opened
it
a
bit
of
paper
fluttered
out
and
picking
it
up
she
read
in
her
aunt
cramped
but
distinct
hand
hepsey
gets
a
dollar
and
a
half
every
week
do
you
pay
her
no
as
the
house
was
set
some
distance
back
the
east
window
in
the
attic
was
the
only
one
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
sea
a
small
table
with
its
legs
sawed
off
came
exactly
to
the
sill
and
here
stood
a
lamp
which
was
a
lamp
simply
without
adornment
and
held
about
a
pint
of
oil
she
read
the
letter
again
and
having
mastered
its
contents
tore
it
into
small
pieces
with
that
urban
caution
which
does
not
come
amiss
in
the
rural
districts
she
understood
that
every
night
of
her
stay
she
was
to
light
this
lamp
with
her
own
hands
but
why
the
varnish
on
the
table
which
had
once
been
glaring
was
scratched
with
innumerable
rings
where
the
rough
glass
had
left
its
mark
ruth
wondered
if
she
were
face
to
face
with
a
mystery
the
seaward
side
of
the
hill
was
a
rocky
cliff
and
between
the
vegetable
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
edge
of
the
precipice
were
a
few
stumps
covered
with
moss
from
her
vantage
point
she
could
see
the
woods
which
began
at
the
base
of
the
hill
on
the
north
side
and
seemed
to
end
at
the
sea
on
the
south
there
were
a
few
trees
near
the
cliff
but
others
near
them
had
been
cut
down
still
farther
south
and
below
the
hill
was
a
grassy
plain
through
which
a
glistening
river
wound
slowly
to
the
ocean
willows
grew
along
its
margin
tipped
with
silvery
green
and
with
masses
of
purple
twilight
tangled
in
the
bare
branches
below
ruth
opened
the
window
and
drew
a
long
breath
her
senses
had
been
dulled
by
the
years
in
the
city
but
childhood
hidden
though
not
forgotten
came
back
as
if
by
magic
with
that
first
scent
of
sea
and
spring
as
yet
she
had
not
fully
realised
how
grateful
she
was
for
this
little
time
away
from
her
desk
and
typewriter
the
managing
editor
had
promised
her
the
same
position
whenever
she
chose
to
go
back
and
there
was
a
little
hoard
in
the
which
she
would
not
need
to
touch
owing
to
the
kindness
of
this
eccentric
aunt
whom
she
had
never
seen
the
large
room
was
a
typical
attic
with
its
and
discarded
furniture
colonial
mahogany
that
would
make
many
a
city
matron
envious
and
for
which
its
owner
cared
little
or
nothing
there
were
chests
of
drawers
two
or
three
battered
trunks
a
cedar
chest
and
countless
boxes
of
various
sizes
bunches
of
sweet
herbs
hung
from
the
rafters
but
there
were
no
cobwebs
because
of
miss
hathaway
perfect
housekeeping
ruth
regretted
the
cobwebs
and
decided
not
to
interfere
should
the
tiny
spinners
take
advantage
of
aunt
jane
absence
she
found
an
old
chair
which
was
unsteady
on
its
rockers
but
not
yet
depraved
enough
to
betray
one
confidence
moving
it
to
the
window
she
sat
down
and
looked
out
at
the
sea
where
the
slow
boom
of
the
surf
came
softly
from
the
shore
mingled
with
the
liquid
melody
of
returning
breakers
the
first
grey
of
twilight
had
come
upon
the
world
before
she
thought
of
going
downstairs
a
hung
upon
the
window
casing
newly
filled
and
mindful
of
her
trust
she
lighted
the
lamp
and
closed
the
window
then
a
sudden
scream
from
the
floor
below
startled
her
miss
thorne
miss
thorne
cried
a
shrill
voice
come
here
quick
white
as
a
sheet
ruth
flew
downstairs
and
met
hepsey
in
the
hall
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
she
gasped
joe
come
with
your
trunk
responded
that
volcanic
young
woman
amiably
where
you
want
it
put
in
the
south
front
room
she
answered
still
frightened
but
glad
nothing
more
serious
had
happened
you
must
scream
like
supper
ready
resumed
hepsey
nonchalantly
and
ruth
followed
her
down
to
the
little
as
she
ate
she
plied
the
maid
with
questions
does
miss
hathaway
light
that
lamp
in
the
attic
every
night
yes
she
cleans
it
and
fills
it
herself
and
she
puts
it
out
every
morning
she
do
never
let
me
touch
why
does
she
keep
it
there
d
know
she

know
why

remarks

short
and

explosive

lighted

money
i
guess
but
she
got
furniture
in
her
parlour
that
just
like
what
miss
hathaway
got
set
away
in
the
attic
we
would
use
them
kind
of
things
nohow
she
added
complacently
does
she
live
all
alone
yes
joe
he
does
her
errands
and
other
folks
stops
in
sometimes
but
miss
ainslie
ai
left
her
front
yard
for
i
d
know
how
long
some
says
she
cracked
but
she
the
best
housekeeper
round
here
and
if
she
hears
of
anybody
that
sick
or
in
trouble
she
allers
things
she
ai
never
been
up
here
but
miss
hathaway
she
goes
down
there
sometimes
and
miss
ainslie
swaps
cookin
quite
regler
i
have
to
go
down
there
with
a
plate
of
somethin
miss
hathaway
made
and
miss
ainslie
allers
says
just
a
moment
please
hepsey
i
would
like
to
send
miss
hathaway
a
jar
of
my
preserves
she
relapsed
unconsciously
into
imitation
of
miss
ainslie
speech
in
the
few
words
softened
and
betraying
a
quaint
stateliness
ruth
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
gentlewoman
reserved
and
yet
gracious
she
folded
her
napkin
saying
you
make
the
best
biscuits
i
ever
tasted
the
girl
smiled
but
made
no
reply
what
makes
you
think
miss
ainslie
has
anything
to
do
with
the
light
she
inquired
after
a
little
there
was
no
light
in
that
winder
when
i
first
come
leastways
not
as
i
know
of
and
after
i
been
here
a
week
or
so
miss
hathaway
she
come
back
from
there
one
day
looking
kinder
strange
she
did
say
much
but
the
next
mornin
she
goes
down
to
town
and
buys
that
lamp
and
she
saws
off
them
table
legs
herself
every
night
since
that
light
been
and
she
puts
it
out
herself
every
before
she
comes
perhaps
she
and
miss
ainslie
had
been
talking
of
shipwreck
and
she
thought
she
would
have
a
little
lighthouse
of
her
own
miss
thorne
suggested
when
the
silence
became
oppressive
so
rejoined
hepsey
she
had
become
stolid
again
ruth
pushed
her
chair
back
and
stood
at
the
window
a
moment
looking
out
into
the
yard
the
valley
was
in
shadow
but
the
last
light
still
lingered
on
the
hill
what
that
hepsey
she
asked
what
what
that
where
the
evergreen
is
coming
up
out
of
the
ground
in
the
shape
of
a
that
the
cat
grave
mum
she
died
jest
afore
miss
hathaway
went
away
and
she
planted
the
i
thought
something
was
lacking
said
ruth
half
to
herself
do
you
want
a
kitten
miss
thorne
inquired
hepsey
eagerly
i
reckon
i
can
get
you
one
maltese
or
white
just
as
you
no
thank
you
hepsey
i
do
believe
i
import
any
jest
as
you
say
mum
it
sorter
lonesome
though
with
no
cat
and
miss
hathaway
said
she
did
want
no
speculating
upon
the
departed
cat
superior
charms
that
made
substitution
seem
like
sacrilege
to
miss
hathaway
ruth
sat
down
for
a
time
in
the
parlour
where
the
shabby
haircloth
furniture
was
ornamented
with
tidies
to
the
last
degree
there
was
a
centre
table
in
the
room
and
a
basket
of
wax
flowers
under
a
glass
case
hemans
poems
another
book
called
the
garland
and
the
family
bible
were
carefully
arranged
upon
it
a
hair
wreath
also
sheltered
by
glass
hung
on
the
wall
near
another
collection
of
wax
flowers
suitably
framed
there
were
various
portraits
of
people
whom
miss
thorne
did
not
know
though
she
was
a
near
relative
of
their
owner
and
two
tall
white
china
vases
decorated
with
gilt
flanked
the
the
carpet
which
was
once
of
the
speaking
variety
had
faded
to
the
listening
point
coarse
lace
curtains
hung
from
brass
rings
on
wooden
poles
and
red
cotton
lambrequins
were
festooned
at
the
top
hepsey
came
in
to
light
the
lamp
that
hung
by
chains
over
the
table
but
miss
thorne
rose
saying
you
need
mind
hepsey
as
i
am
going
want
me
to
help
you
unpack
she
asked
doubtless
wishing
for
a
view
of
city
no
thank
i
put
a
pitcher
of
water
in
your
room
miss
thorne
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
nothing
more
thank
she
still
lingered
irresolute
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
miss
thorne
she
began
hesitatingly
yes
be
you
be
you
a
lady
detective
ruth
clear
laughter
rang
out
on
the
evening
air
why
no
you
foolish
girl
i
a
newspaper
woman
and
earned
a
rest
that
all
you
must
read
books
with
yellow
hepsey
withdrew
muttering
vague
apologies
and
ruth
found
her
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
she
went
up
to
her
room
how
long
have
you
been
with
miss
hathaway
she
asked
five
years
come
next
good
night
good
night
miss
from
sheer
force
of
habit
ruth
locked
her
door
her
trunk
was
not
a
large
one
and
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
put
her
simple
wardrobe
into
the
capacious
closet
and
the
dresser
drawers
as
she
moved
the
empty
trunk
into
the
closet
she
remembered
the
box
of
money
that
she
had
left
in
the
attic
and
went
up
to
get
it
when
she
returned
she
heard
hepsey
door
close
softly
silly
child
she
said
to
herself
i
might
just
as
well
ask
her
if
she
is
detective
they
laugh
about
that
in
the
office
when
i
go
she
sat
down
rocking
contentedly
for
it
was
april
and
she
would
not
have
to
go
back
until
aunt
jane
came
home
probably
about
the
first
of
october
she
checked
off
the
free
months
on
her
tired
fingers
that
would
know
the
blue
pencil
and
the
typewriter
no
more
until
autumn
when
she
would
be
strong
again
and
the
quivering
nerves
quite
steady
she
blessed
the
legacy
which
had
fallen
into
jane
hathaway
lap
and
led
her
at
to
join
a
personally
conducted
party
to
the
old
world
ruth
had
always
had
a
dim
yearning
for
foreign
travel
but
just
now
she
felt
no
latent
injustice
such
as
had
often
rankled
in
her
soul
when
her
friends
went
and
she
remained
at
home
thinking
she
heard
hepsey
in
the
hall
and
not
caring
to
arouse
further
suspicion
she
put
out
her
light
and
sat
by
the
window
with
the
shutters
wide
open
far
down
the
hill
where
the
road
became
level
again
and
on
the
left
as
she
looked
toward
the
village
was
the
white
house
surrounded
by
a
garden
and
a
hedge
which
she
supposed
was
miss
ainslie
a
timid
chirp
came
from
the
grass
and
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
growing
things
floated
in
through
the
open
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
train
from
the
city
sounded
a
warning
whistle
as
it
approached
the
station
and
then
a
light
shone
on
the
grass
in
front
of
miss
house
it
was
a
little
gleam
evidently
from
a
candle
so
she
keeping
a
lighthouse
too
thought
ruth
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
station
and
half
an
hour
afterward
the
light
disappeared
she
meditated
upon
the
general
subject
of
illumination
while
she
got
ready
for
bed
but
as
soon
as
her
head
touched
the
pillow
she
lost
consciousness
and
knew
no
more
until
the
morning
light
crept
into
her
room
ii
the
attic
the
maid
sat
in
the
kitchen
wondering
why
miss
thorne
did
not
come
down
it
was
almost
seven
and
miss
hathaway
breakfast
hour
was
half
past
six
hepsey
did
not
frame
the
thought
but
she
had
a
vague
impression
that
the
guest
was
lazy
yet
she
was
grateful
for
the
new
interest
which
had
come
into
her
monotonous
life
affairs
moved
like
clock
work
at
miss
hathaway
breakfast
at
half
past
six
dinner
at
one
and
supper
at
half
past
five
each
day
was
also
set
apart
by
its
regular
duties
from
the
washing
on
monday
to
the
baking
on
saturday
now
it
was
possible
that
there
might
be
a
change
miss
thorne
seemed
fully
capable
of
setting
the
house
and
miss
hathaway
last
injunction
had
been
now
hepsey
you
mind
miss
thorne
if
i
hear
that
you
do
you
lose
your
the
young
woman
who
slumbered
peacefully
upstairs
while
the
rest
of
the
world
was
awake
had
from
the
beginning
aroused
admiration
in
hepsey
breast
it
was
a
reluctant
rebellious
feeling
mingled
with
an
indefinite
fear
but
it
was
admiration
none
the
less
during
the
greater
part
of
a
wondering
wakeful
night
the
excited
hepsey
had
seen
miss
thorne
as
plainly
as
when
she
first
entered
the
house
the
tall
straight
graceful
figure
was
familiar
by
this
time
and
the
subdued
silken
rustle
of
her
skirts
was
a
wonted
sound
face
naturally
mobile
had
been
schooled
into
a
certain
reserve
but
her
deep
dark
eyes
were
eloquent
and
always
would
be
hepsey
wondered
at
the
opaque
whiteness
of
her
skin
and
the
baffling
arrangement
of
her
hair
the
young
women
of
the
village
had
rosy
cheeks
but
miss
face
was
colourless
except
for
her
lips
it
was
very
strange
hepsey
thought
for
miss
hathaway
to
sail
before
her
niece
came
if
indeed
miss
thorne
was
her
niece
there
was
a
mystery
in
the
house
on
the
hilltop
which
she
had
tried
in
vain
to
fathom
foreign
letters
came
frequently
no
two
of
them
from
the
same
person
and
the
lamp
in
the
attic
window
had
burned
steadily
every
night
for
five
years
otherwise
everything
was
explainable
and
sane
still
miss
thorne
did
not
seem
even
remotely
related
to
her
aunt
and
hepsey
had
her
doubts
moreover
the
guest
had
an
uncanny
gift
which
amounted
to
second
sight
how
did
she
know
that
all
of
hepsey
books
had
yellow
covers
miss
hathaway
could
not
have
told
her
in
the
letter
for
the
mistress
was
not
awire
of
her
maid
literary
tendencies
it
was
half
past
seven
but
no
sound
came
from
upstairs
she
replenished
the
fire
and
resumed
meditation
whatever
miss
thorne
might
prove
to
be
she
was
decidedly
interesting
it
wis
pleasant
to
watch
her
to
feel
the
subtle
refinement
of
all
her
belongings
and
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
next
perhaps
miss
thorne
would
take
her
back
to
the
city
as
her
maid
when
miss
hathaway
came
home
for
in
the
books
such
things
frequently
happened
would
she
go
hepsey
was
trying
to
decide
when
there
was
a
light
rapid
step
on
the
stairs
a
moment
hesitation
in
the
hall
and
miss
thorne
came
into
the
good
morning
hepsey
she
said
cheerily
am
i
late
yes
it
goin
on
eight
and
miss
hathaway
allers
has
breakfast
at
half
past
how
ghastly
ruth
thought
i
should
have
told
you
she
said
i
will
have
mine
at
yes
replied
hepsey
apparently
unmoved
what
time
do
you
want
dinner
at
six
luncheon
at
half
past
hepsey
was
puzzled
but
in
a
few
moments
she
understood
that
dinner
was
to
be
served
at
night
and
supper
at
midday
breakfast
had
already
been
moved
forward
an
hour
and
a
half
and
stranger
things
might
happen
at
any
minute
ruth
had
several
other
reforms
in
mind
but
deemed
it
best
to
wait
after
breakfast
she
remembered
the
lamp
in
the
window
and
went
up
to
put
it
out
it
was
still
burning
when
she
reached
it
though
the
oil
was
almost
gone
and
placing
it
by
the
stairway
that
she
might
not
forget
to
have
it
filled
she
determined
to
explore
the
attic
to
her
heart
content
the
sunlight
streamed
through
the
east
window
and
searched
the
farthest
corners
of
the
room
the
floor
was
bare
and
worn
but
carefully
swept
and
the
things
that
were
stored
there
were
huddled
together
far
back
under
the
eaves
as
if
to
make
room
for
others
it
was
not
idle
curiosity
but
delicate
sentiment
that
made
ruth
eager
to
open
the
trunks
and
dresser
drawers
and
to
turn
over
the
contents
of
the
boxes
that
were
piled
together
and
covered
with
dust
the
interest
of
the
lower
part
of
the
house
paled
in
comparison
with
the
first
real
attic
she
had
ever
been
in
after
all
why
not
miss
hathaway
was
her
aunt
her
mother
only
sister
and
the
house
was
in
her
care
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
she
should
not
amuse
herself
in
her
own
way
ruth
instincts
were
against
it
but
reason
triumphed
the
bunches
of
dried
herbs
hanging
from
the
rafters
and
swaying
back
and
forth
in
ghostly
fashion
gave
out
a
wholesome
fragrance
and
when
she
opened
trunks
whose
lids
creaked
on
their
rusty
hinges
dried
rosemary
lavender
and
sweet
clover
filled
the
room
with
that
sweetness
which
is
the
gracious
handmaiden
of
memory
miss
hathaway
was
a
thrifty
soul
but
she
never
stored
discarded
clothing
that
might
be
of
use
to
any
one
and
so
ruth
found
no
garments
of
bygone
pattern
but
only
things
which
seemed
to
be
kept
for
the
sake
of
their
tender
associations
there
were
letters
on
whose
yellowed
pages
the
words
had
long
since
faded
a
dogeared
primer
and
several
well
worn
schoolbooks
each
having
on
its
jane
hathaway
her
book
scraps
of
lace
brocade
ard
rustling
taffeta
quilt
patterns
needlebooks
and
all
of
the
eloquent
treasures
that
a
well
stored
attic
can
yield
as
she
replaced
them
singing
softly
to
herself
a
folded
newspaper
slipped
to
the
floor
it
was
yellow
and
worn
like
the
letters
and
she
unfolded
it
carefully
it
was
over
thirty
years
old
and
around
a
paragraph
on
the
last
page
a
faint
line
still
lingered
it
was
an
announcement
of
the
marriage
of
charles
winfield
captain
of
the
schooner
mary
to
miss
abigail
weatherby
abigail
weatherby
she
said
aloud
the
name
had
a
sweet
sound
they
must
have
been
aunt
jane
she
closed
the
trunk
and
pushed
it
back
to
its
place
under
the
eaves
in
a
distant
corner
was
the
old
cedar
chest
heavily
carved
she
pulled
it
out
into
the
light
her
cheeks
glowing
with
quiet
happiness
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
it
it
was
evidently
miss
hathaway
treasure
box
put
away
in
the
attic
when
spinsterhood
was
confirmed
by
the
fleeting
years
on
top
folded
carefully
in
a
sheet
was
a
gown
of
white
brocade
and
quaint
trimmed
with
pearl
passementerie
the
neck
was
square
cut
modestly
low
and
filled
in
with
lace
of
a
delicate
frosty
pattern
point
underneath
the
gown
lay
piles
of
lingerie
all
of
the
finest
linen
daintily
made
by
hand
some
of
it
was
trimmed
with
real
lace
some
with
crocheted
edging
and
the
rest
with
hemstitched
ruffles
and
there
was
another
gown
much
worn
of
soft
blue
cashmere
some
a
necklace
of
uncut
turquoises
the
colour
changed
to
green
a
a
little
hymnal
and
a
bundle
of
letters
tied
with
a
faded
blue
ribbon
which
she
did
not
touch
there
was
but
one
picture
an
ambrotype
in
an
ornate
case
of
a
handsome
young
man
with
that
dashing
look
in
his
eyes
which
has
ever
been
attractive
to
women
ruth
smiled
as
she
put
the
treasures
away
thinking
that
had
fate
thrown
the
dice
another
way
the
young
man
might
have
been
her
esteemed
and
respected
uncle
then
all
at
once
it
came
to
her
that
she
had
unthinkingly
stumbled
upon
her
aunt
romance
she
was
not
a
woman
to
pry
into
others
secrets
and
felt
guilty
as
she
fled
from
the
attic
taking
the
lamp
with
her
afterward
as
she
sat
on
the
narrow
piazza
basking
in
the
warm
spring
sunshine
she
pieced
out
the
love
affair
of
jane
hathaway
early
girlhood
after
her
own
fashion
she
could
see
it
all
plainly
aunt
jane
had
expected
to
be
married
to
the
dashing
young
man
and
had
had
her
trousseau
in
readiness
when
something
happened
the
folded
paper
would
indicate
that
he
was
charles
winfield
who
had
married
some
one
else
but
whether
aunt
jane
had
broken
her
engagement
or
the
possible
uncle
charles
had
simply
taken
a
mate
without
any
such
formality
was
a
subject
of
conjecture
still
if
the
recreant
lover
had
married
another
would
aunt
jane
have
kept
her
treasure
chest
and
her
wedding
gown
ruth
knew
that
she
herself
would
not
but
she
understood
that
aunts
were
in
a
class
by
themselves
it
was
possible
that
charles
winfield
was
an
earlier
lover
and
she
had
kept
the
paper
without
any
special
motive
or
perhaps
for
auld
lang
probably
the
letters
would
have
disclosed
the
mystery
and
the
newspaper
instinct
on
the
trail
of
a
story
was
struggling
with
her
sense
of
honour
but
not
for
the
world
now
that
she
knew
would
ruth
have
read
the
yellowed
pages
which
doubtless
held
faded
roses
pressed
between
them
the
strings
of
and
the
larger
ones
which
could
have
come
only
from
foreign
shores
together
with
the
light
in
the
window
gave
her
a
sudden
clew
aunt
jane
was
waiting
for
her
lover
and
the
lamp
was
a
signal
if
his
name
was
charles
winfield
the
other
woman
was
dead
and
if
not
the
marriage
notice
was
that
of
a
friend
or
an
earlier
lover
the
explanation
was
reasonable
clear
and
concise
what
woman
could
ask
for
more
yet
there
was
something
beyond
it
which
was
out
of
miss
thorne
grasp
a
tantalising
something
which
would
not
be
allayed
then
she
reflected
that
the
summer
was
before
tier
and
in
reality
now
that
she
was
off
the
paper
she
had
no
business
with
other
affairs
the
sun
was
hidden
by
gathering
clouds
and
the
air
was
damp
before
ruth
missed
the
bright
warmth
on
the
piazza
and
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
by
way
of
keeping
warm
a
gravelled
path
led
to
the
gate
and
on
either
side
was
a
row
of
lilac
bushes
the
bare
stalks
tipped
with
green
a
white
picket
fence
surrounded
the
yard
except
at
the
back
where
the
edge
of
the
precipice
made
it
useless
the
place
was
small
and
well
kept
but
there
were
no
flower
beds
except
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
there
were
only
two
or
three
trees
she
walked
around
the
vegetable
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
a
portion
of
her
summer
sustenance
was
planted
and
discovered
an
unused
gate
at
the
side
which
swung
back
and
forth
idly
without
latching
she
was
looking
over
the
fence
and
down
the
steep
hillside
when
a
sharp
voice
at
her
elbow
made
her
jump
sech
as
wants
dinner
can
come
in
and
get
it
announced
hepsey
sourly
i
yelled
and
yelled
till
i
most
bust
my
throat
and
i
to
yell
no
she
returned
to
the
house
a
picture
of
offended
dignity
but
carefully
left
the
door
ajar
for
ruth
who
discovered
upon
this
rude
awakening
from
her
reverie
that
she
was
very
hungry
in
the
afternoon
the
chill
fog
made
it
impossible
to
go
out
for
the
wind
had
risen
from
the
sea
and
driven
the
salt
mist
inland
miss
hathaway
library
was
meagre
and
uninteresting
hepsey
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
ruth
was
frankly
bored
reduced
at
last
to
the
desperate
strait
of
putting
all
her
belongings
in
irreproachable
order
she
found
herself
at
four
without
occupation
the
temptation
in
the
attic
wrestled
strongly
with
her
but
she
would
not
go
it
seemed
an
age
until
six
this
wo
do
she
said
to
herself
i
have
to
learn
how
to
sew
or
crochet
or
make
tatting
at
last
i
am
to
be
domesticated
i
used
to
wonder
how
women
had
time
for
the
endless
fancy
work
but
i
see
she
was
accustomed
to
self
analysis
and
introspection
and
began
to
consider
what
she
could
get
out
of
the
next
six
months
in
the
way
of
gain
physical
strength
certainly
but
what
else
the
prospect
was
gloomy
just
then
it
goin
to
rain
miss
thorne
said
hepsey
at
the
door
is
all
the
winders
shut
yes
i
think
so
she
answered
supper
ready
any
time
you
want
very
well
i
will
come
when
she
sat
down
in
the
parlour
after
doing
scant
justice
to
cooking
it
was
with
a
grim
resignation
of
the
puritan
sort
which
supposedly
went
with
the
house
there
was
but
one
place
in
all
the
world
where
she
would
like
to
be
and
she
was
afraid
to
trust
herself
in
the
attic
by
an
elaborate
mental
process
she
convinced
herself
that
the
cedar
chest
and
the
old
trunks
did
not
concern
her
in
the
least
and
tried
to
develop
a
feminine
fear
of
mice
which
was
not
natural
to
her
she
had
just
placed
herself
loftily
above
all
mundane
things
when
hepsey
marched
into
the
room
and
placed
the
attic
lamp
newly
filled
upon
the
marble
table
here
was
a
manifest
duty
confronting
a
very
superior
person
and
as
she
went
upstairs
she
determined
to
come
back
immediately
but
when
she
had
put
the
light
in
the
seaward
window
she
lingered
under
the
spell
of
the
room
the
rain
beat
steadily
upon
the
roof
and
dripped
from
the
eaves
the
light
made
distorted
shadows
upon
the
wall
and
floor
while
the
bunches
of
herbs
hanging
from
the
rafters
swung
lightly
back
and
forth
when
the
wind
rattled
the
windows
and
shook
the
old
house
the
room
seemed
peopled
by
the
previous
generation
that
had
slept
in
the
massive
mahogany
bed
rocked
in
the
chairs
with
sewing
or
gossip
and
stood
before
the
old
dresser
on
tiptoe
peering
eagerly
into
the
mirror
which
probably
had
hung
above
it
it
was
as
if
memory
sat
at
the
idly
twisting
the
thread
and
bringing
visions
of
the
years
gone
by
a
cracked
mirror
hung
against
the
wall
and
ruth
saw
her
reflection
dimly
as
if
she
too
belonged
to
the
ghosts
of
the
attic
she
was
not
vain
but
she
was
satisfied
with
her
eyes
and
hair
her
white
skin
impervious
to
tan
or
burn
and
the
shape
of
her
mouth
the
saucy
little
upward
tilt
at
the
end
of
her
nose
was
a
great
cross
to
her
however
because
it
was
at
variance
with
the
dignified
bearing
which
she
chose
to
maintain
as
she
looked
she
wondered
vaguely
if
she
like
aunt
jane
would
grow
to
a
loveless
old
age
it
seemed
probable
for
at
the
prince
had
not
appeared
she
had
her
work
and
was
happy
yet
unceasingly
behind
those
dark
eyes
ruth
soul
kept
maidenly
match
for
its
mate
when
she
turned
to
go
downstairs
a
folded
newspaper
on
the
floor
attracted
her
attention
it
was
near
one
of
the
trunks
which
she
had
opened
and
must
have
fallen
out
she
picked
it
up
to
replace
it
but
it
proved
to
be
another
paper
dated
a
year
later
than
the
first
one
there
was
no
marked
paragraph
but
she
soon
discovered
the
death
notice
of
abigail
winfield
nee
weatherby
aged
she
put
it
into
the
trunk
out
of
which
she
knew
it
must
have
fallen
and
stood
there
thinking
those
faded
letters
hidden
under
aunt
jane
wedding
gown
were
tempting
her
with
their
mute
secret
as
never
before
she
hesitated
took
three
steps
toward
the
cedar
chest
then
fled
ingloriously
from
the
field
whoever
charles
winfeld
was
he
was
free
to
love
and
marry
again
perhaps
there
had
been
an
estrangement
and
it
was
he
for
whom
aunt
jane
was
waiting
since
sometimes
out
of
bitterness
the
years
distil
forgiveness
she
wondered
at
the
nature
which
was
tender
enough
to
keep
the
wedding
gown
and
the
pathetic
little
treasures
brave
enough
to
keep
the
paper
with
its
evidence
of
falseness
and
great
enough
to
forgive
yet
what
right
had
she
to
suppose
aunt
jane
was
waiting
had
she
gone
abroad
to
seek
him
and
win
his
recreant
heart
again
or
was
abigail
weatherby
her
girlhood
friend
who
had
married
unhappily
and
then
died
somewhere
in
aunt
jane
years
there
was
a
romance
but
after
all
it
was
not
her
niece
business
i
an
imaginative
goose
ruth
said
to
herself
i
asked
to
keep
a
light
in
the
window
presumably
as
an
incipient
lighthouse
and
i
found
some
old
clothes
and
two
old
papers
in
the
attic
that
all
and
i
constructed
a
she
resolutely
put
the
whole
matter
aside
as
she
sat
in
her
room
rocking
pensively
her
own
lamp
had
not
been
filled
and
was
burning
dimly
so
she
put
it
out
and
sat
in
the
darkness
listening
to
the
rain
she
had
not
closed
the
shutters
and
did
not
care
to
lean
out
in
the
storm
and
so
it
was
that
when
the
whistle
of
the
ten
train
sounded
hoarsely
she
saw
the
little
glimmer
of
light
from
miss
ainslie
window
making
a
faint
circle
in
the
darkness
half
an
hour
later
as
before
it
was
taken
away
the
scent
of
lavender
and
sweet
clover
clung
to
miss
hathaway
linen
and
insensibly
soothed
ruth
went
to
sleep
after
hours
of
dreamless
slumber
she
thought
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
and
telling
her
not
to
forget
the
light
it
was
so
real
that
she
started
to
her
feet
half
expecting
to
find
some
one
standing
beside
her
the
rain
had
ceased
and
two
or
three
stars
like
timid
children
were
peeping
at
the
world
from
behind
the
threatening
cloud
it
was
that
mystical
moment
which
no
one
may
place
the
turning
of
night
to
day
far
down
the
hill
ghostly
but
not
forbidding
was
miss
ainslie
house
the
garden
around
it
lying
whitely
beneath
the
dews
of
dawn
and
up
in
the
attic
window
the
light
still
shone
like
unfounded
hope
in
a
soul
harking
across
distant
seas
of
misunderstanding
and
gloom
with
its
pitiful
all
hail
iii
miss
ainslie
ruth
began
to
feel
a
lively
interest
in
her
aunt
jane
and
to
regret
that
she
had
not
arrived
in
time
to
make
her
acquaintance
she
knew
that
miss
hathaway
was
three
or
four
years
younger
than
thorne
would
have
been
had
she
lived
and
that
a
legacy
had
recently
come
to
her
from
an
old
friend
but
that
was
all
aside
from
the
discoveries
in
the
attic
she
contemplated
the
crayon
portraits
in
the
parlour
and
hoped
she
was
not
related
to
any
of
them
in
the
family
album
she
found
no
woman
whom
she
would
have
liked
for
an
aunt
but
was
determined
to
know
the
worst
is
miss
hathaway
picture
here
hepsey
she
asked
no
miss
hathaway
she
would
have
her
picter
in
the
parlour
nohow
some
folks
does
but
miss
hathaway
i
think
she
right
hepsey
laughed
ruth
though
i
never
thought
of
it
in
just
that
way
i
have
to
wait
until
she
comes
in
the
afternoon
she
donned
the
short
skirt
and
heavy
shoes
of
her
office
rig
and
started
down
hill
to
explore
the
village
it
was
a
day
to
tempt
one
out
of
doors
cool
and
bright
with
that
indefinable
crispness
which
belongs
to
spring
the
hill
rose
sheer
from
the
highlands
which
sloped
to
the
river
on
the
left
as
she
went
down
and
on
the
right
to
the
forest
a
side
path
into
the
woods
made
her
hesitate
for
a
moment
but
she
went
straight
on
it
was
the
usual
small
town
which
nestles
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
eventually
climbs
over
it
through
the
enterprise
of
its
wealthier
residents
but
save
for
miss
hathaway
house
the
enterprise
had
not
as
yet
become
evident
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
left
was
miss
ainslie
house
and
garden
and
directly
opposite
with
the
width
of
the
hill
between
them
was
a
brown
house
with
a
lawn
but
no
garden
except
that
devoted
to
vegetables
as
she
walked
through
the
village
stopping
to
look
at
the
display
of
merchandise
in
the
window
of
the
single
shop
which
was
also
and
grocery
she
attracted
a
great
deal
of
respectful
attention
for
in
this
community
strangers
were
an
event
ruth
reflected
that
the
shop
had
only
to
grow
to
about
fifty
times
its
present
size
in
order
to
become
a
department
store
and
bring
upon
the
town
the
rank
and
dignity
of
a
metropolis
when
she
turned
her
face
homeward
she
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
before
she
realised
that
the
first
long
walk
over
country
roads
was
hard
for
one
accustomed
to
city
pavements
a
broad
flat
stone
offered
an
inviting
and
she
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
miss
ainslie
hedge
hoping
joe
would
pass
in
time
to
take
her
to
the
top
of
the
hill
the
hedge
was
high
and
except
for
the
gate
the
garden
was
secluded
i
seem
to
get
more
tired
every
minute
she
thought
i
wonder
if
got
the
she
scanned
the
horizon
eagerly
for
the
dilapidated
conveyance
which
she
had
once
both
feared
and
scorned
no
sound
could
have
been
more
welcome
than
the
rumble
of
those
creaking
wheels
nor
any
sight
more
pleasing
than
the
conflicting
expressions
in
mamie
single
useful
eye
she
sat
there
a
long
time
waiting
for
deliverance
but
it
did
not
come
i
get
an
alpenstock
she
said
to
herself
as
she
rose
wearily
and
tried
to
summon
courage
to
start
then
the
gate
clicked
softly
and
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
said
my
dear
you
are
tired
wo
you
come
in
turning
she
saw
miss
ainslie
smiling
graciously
in
a
moment
she
had
explained
that
she
was
miss
hathaway
niece
and
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
come
in
for
a
few
moments
yes
said
the
sweet
voice
again
i
know
who
you
are
your
aunt
told
me
all
about
you
and
i
trust
we
shall
be
ruth
followed
her
up
the
gravelled
path
to
the
house
and
into
the
parlour
where
a
wood
fire
blazed
cheerily
upon
the
hearth
it
is
so
damp
this
time
of
year
she
went
on
that
i
like
to
keep
my
fire
while
they
were
talking
ruth
eyes
rested
with
pleasure
upon
her
hostess
she
herself
was
tall
but
miss
ainslie
towered
above
her
she
was
a
woman
of
poise
and
magnificent
bearing
and
she
had
the
composure
which
comes
to
some
as
a
right
and
to
others
with
long
social
training
her
abundant
hair
was
like
spun
silver
it
was
not
merely
white
but
it
shone
her
skin
was
as
fresh
and
fair
as
a
girl
and
when
she
smiled
one
saw
that
her
teeth
were
white
and
even
but
the
great
charm
of
her
face
was
her
eyes
they
were
violet
so
deep
in
colour
as
to
seem
almost
black
in
certain
lights
and
behind
them
lay
an
indescribable
something
which
made
ruth
love
her
instinctively
she
might
have
been
forty
or
seventy
but
she
was
beautiful
with
the
beauty
that
never
fades
at
intervals
not
wishing
to
stare
ruth
glanced
around
the
room
having
once
seen
the
woman
one
could
not
fail
to
recognise
her
house
for
it
suited
her
the
floors
were
hardwood
highly
polished
and
partly
covered
with
rare
oriental
rugs
the
walls
were
a
soft
dark
green
bearing
no
disfiguring
design
and
the
windows
were
draped
with
net
edged
with
duchesse
lace
miss
hathaway
curtains
hung
straight
to
the
floor
but
miss
ainslie
were
tied
back
with
white
cord
the
furniture
was
colonial
mahogany
unspoiled
by
varnish
and
rubbed
until
it
shone
you
have
a
beautiful
home
said
ruth
during
a
pause
yes
she
replied
i
like
you
have
a
great
many
beautiful
yes
she
answered
softly
they
were
given
to
me
by
a
a
she
must
have
had
a
great
many
observed
ruth
admiring
one
of
the
rugs
a
delicate
pink
suffused
miss
ainslie
face
my
friend
she
said
with
quiet
dignity
is
a
seafaring
that
explained
the
rugs
ruth
thought
and
the
vase
of
finest
cloisonne
which
stood
upon
the
it
accounted
also
for
the
bertha
of
mechlin
lace
which
was
fastened
to
miss
ainslie
gown
of
lavender
cashmere
by
a
large
amethyst
inlaid
with
gold
and
surrounded
by
baroque
pearls
for
some
little
time
they
talked
of
miss
hathaway
and
her
travels
i
told
her
she
was
too
old
to
go
said
miss
ainslie
smiling
but
she
assured
me
that
she
could
take
care
of
herself
and
i
think
she
can
even
if
she
could
she
is
perfectly
safe
these
parties
are
by
far
the
best
if
one
goes
alone
for
the
first
ruth
knew
that
but
she
was
surprised
nevertheless
wo
you
tell
me
about
my
aunt
miss
ainslie
she
asked
you
know
i
never
seen
why
yes
of
course
i
will
where
shall
i
begin
at
the
beginning
answered
ruth
with
a
little
laugh
the
beginning
is
very
far
away
deary
said
miss
ainslie
and
ruth
fancied
she
heard
a
sigh
she
came
here
long
before
i
did
and
we
were
girls
together
she
lived
in
the
old
house
at
the
top
of
the
hill
with
her
father
and
mother
and
i
lived
here
with
mine
we
were
very
intimate
for
a
long
time
and
then
we
had
a
quarrel
about
something
that
was
so
silly
and
foolish
that
i
can
not
even
remember
what
it
was
for
five
years
no
for
almost
six
we
passed
each
other
like
strangers
because
each
was
too
proud
and
stubborn
to
yield
but
death
and
trouble
brought
us
together
who
spoke
first
asked
ruth
much
interested
you
or
aunt
jane
it
was
i
of
course
i
do
believe
she
would
have
done
it
she
was
always
stronger
than
i
and
though
i
ca
remember
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
i
can
feel
the
hurt
to
my
pride
even
at
this
i
know
answered
ruth
quickly
something
of
the
same
kind
once
happened
to
me
only
it
was
pride
that
held
me
back
it
was
just
plain
stubbornness
sometimes
i
am
conscious
of
two
selves
one
of
me
is
a
nice
polite
person
that
i
really
fond
of
and
the
other
is
so
contrary
and
so
mulish
that
i
actually
afraid
of
her
when
the
two
come
in
conflict
the
stubborn
one
always
wins
i
sorry
but
i
help
do
you
think
we
all
like
that
asked
miss
ainslie
readily
understanding
i
do
not
believe
any
one
can
have
strength
of
character
without
being
stubborn
to
hold
one
position
in
the
face
of
obstacles
and
never
be
tempted
to
yield
to
me
that
seems
the
very
yes
but
to
be
unable
to
yield
when
you
know
you
should
that
is
it
inquired
miss
ainslie
with
quiet
amusement
ask
aunt
jane
returned
ruth
laughing
i
begin
to
perceive
our
definite
miss
ainslie
leaned
forward
to
put
another
maple
log
on
the
fire
tell
me
more
about
aunt
jane
ruth
suggested
i
getting
to
be
relative
instead
of
an
orphan
stranded
on
the
shore
of
the
she
hard
to
analyse
began
the
older
woman
i
have
never
been
able
to
reconcile
her
firmness
with
her
softness
she
as
hard
as
new
england
granite
but
i
think
she
wears
it
like
a
mask
sometimes
one
sees
through
she
scolds
me
very
often
about
anything
that
occurs
to
her
but
i
never
pay
any
attention
to
it
she
says
i
should
live
here
all
alone
and
that
i
deserve
to
have
something
dreadful
happen
to
me
but
she
had
all
the
trees
cut
down
that
stood
on
the
hill
between
her
window
and
mine
and
had
a
key
made
to
my
lower
door
and
made
me
promise
that
if
i
was
ill
at
any
time
i
would
put
a
signal
in
my
window
a
red
shawl
in
the
daytime
and
a
light
at
night
i
had
any
red
shawl
and
she
gave
me
hers
one
night
i
shall
never
forget
it
i
had
a
terrible
attack
of
neuralgia
during
the
worst
storm
i
have
ever
known
i
did
even
know
that
i
put
the
light
in
the
window
i
was
so
beside
myself
with
pain
but
she
came
at
two
in
the
morning
and
stayed
with
me
until
i
was
all
right
again
she
was
so
gentle
and
so
tender
i
shall
always
love
her
for
the
sweet
voice
vibrated
with
feeling
and
ruth
thoughts
flew
to
the
light
in
the
attic
window
but
no
it
could
not
be
seen
from
miss
ainslie
what
does
aunt
jane
look
like
she
asked
after
a
pause
i
have
a
picture
except
one
that
was
taken
a
long
time
ago
but
i
get
she
went
upstairs
and
returned
presently
putting
an
ambrotype
into
ruth
hand
the
case
enshrined
aunt
jane
in
the
bloom
of
her
youth
it
was
a
young
woman
of
twenty
or
seated
in
a
chair
with
her
hands
encased
in
black
lace
mitts
and
folded
in
the
lap
of
her
striped
silk
gown
the
forehead
was
high
protruding
slightly
the
eyes
rather
small
and
very
dark
the
nose
straight
and
the
little
chin
exceedingly
firm
and
determined
there
was
an
expression
of
maidenly
wistfulness
somewhere
which
ruth
could
not
definitely
locate
but
there
was
no
hint
of
it
in
the
chin
poor
little
aunt
jane
said
ruth
life
never
would
be
easy
for
no
returned
miss
ainslie
but
she
would
not
let
anyone
ruth
strolled
over
to
the
window
thinking
that
she
must
be
going
and
miss
ainslie
still
held
the
picture
in
her
hand
she
had
a
lover
did
she
asked
ruth
idly
so
answered
the
other
unwillingly
you
remember
we
a
young
man
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
looked
at
miss
house
and
then
at
the
brown
one
across
the
hill
from
her
position
in
the
window
ruth
saw
him
plainly
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
went
toward
the
brown
house
she
noted
that
he
was
a
stranger
there
was
no
such
topcoat
in
the
village
was
his
name
winfield
she
asked
suddenly
then
instantly
hated
herself
for
the
question
the
ambrotype
fell
to
the
floor
miss
ainslie
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
ruth
did
not
see
her
face
perhaps
she
said
in
a
strange
tone
but
i
never
have
asked
a
lady
the
name
of
her
gentle
as
it
was
ruth
felt
the
rebuke
keenly
an
apology
was
on
her
lips
but
only
her
flushed
cheeks
betrayed
any
emotion
miss
face
was
pale
and
there
was
unmistakable
resentment
in
her
eyes
i
must
go
ruth
said
after
an
awkward
silence
and
in
an
instant
miss
ainslie
was
herself
again
must
go
deary
you
have
seen
my
garden
yet
i
have
planted
all
the
seeds
and
some
of
them
are
coming
up
is
it
beautiful
to
see
things
grow
it
is
indeed
ruth
assented
forgetting
the
momentary
awkwardness
and
i
have
lived
for
a
long
time
where
i
have
seen
nothing
grow
but
car
tracks
and
high
buildings
may
i
come
again
and
see
your
garden
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
you
replied
miss
ainslie
with
a
quaint
stateliness
i
have
enjoyed
your
visit
so
much
and
i
hope
you
will
come
again
very
thank
you
i
her
hostess
had
opened
the
door
for
her
but
ruth
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
in
obedience
to
some
strange
impulse
then
she
stepped
outside
but
something
held
her
that
lay
unspoken
between
them
those
unfathomable
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
questioning
pleading
and
searching
her
inmost
soul
ruth
looked
at
her
wondering
and
striving
to
answer
the
mute
appeal
then
miss
ainslie
laid
her
hand
upon
her
arm
my
dear
she
asked
earnestly
do
you
light
the
lamp
in
the
attic
window
every
night
yes
i
do
miss
ainslie
she
answered
quickly
the
older
woman
caught
her
breath
as
if
in
relief
and
then
the
deep
crimson
flooded
her
face
hepsey
told
me
and
aunt
jane
left
a
letter
about
it
ruth
continued
hastily
and
i
am
very
glad
to
do
it
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
a
ship
wrecked
almost
at
our
yes
sighed
miss
ainslie
her
colour
receding
i
have
often
thought
of
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
it
is
so
terrible
and
sometimes
when
i
hear
the
surf
beating
against
the
cliff
i
i
am
ruth
climbed
the
hill
interested
happy
yet
deeply
disturbed
miss
ainslie
beautiful
changing
face
seemed
to
follow
her
and
the
exquisite
scent
of
the
lavender
which
had
filled
the
rooms
clung
to
her
senses
like
a
benediction
hepsey
was
right
and
unquestionably
miss
ainslie
had
something
to
do
with
the
light
but
no
deep
meaning
lay
behind
it
so
much
was
certain
she
had
lived
alone
so
long
that
she
had
grown
to
have
a
great
fear
of
shipwreck
possibly
on
account
of
her
friend
the
seafaring
gentleman
and
had
asked
miss
hathaway
to
put
the
light
in
the
window
that
was
all
ruth
reason
was
fully
satisfied
but
something
else
was
not
i
not
going
to
think
about
it
any
more
she
said
to
herself
resolutely
and
thought
she
meant
it
she
ate
her
dinner
with
the
zest
of
hunger
while
hepsey
noiselessly
served
her
i
have
been
to
miss
ainslie
hepsey
she
said
at
length
not
wishing
to
appear
unsociable
the
maid
clouded
visage
cleared
for
an
instant
did
you
find
out
about
the
lamp
she
inquired
eagerly
no
i
did
hepsey
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
miss
ainslie
has
read
a
great
deal
and
has
lived
alone
so
much
that
she
has
become
very
much
afraid
of
shipwreck
you
know
all
of
us
have
some
one
fear
for
instance
i
am
terribly
afraid
of
green
worms
though
a
green
worm
has
never
harmed
me
i
think
she
asked
miss
hathaway
to
put
the
lamp
in
the
window
and
possibly
told
her
of
something
she
had
read
which
made
her
feel
that
she
should
have
done
it
hepsey
face
took
on
its
old
impenetrable
calm
do
you
think
so
asked
miss
thorne
after
a
long
pause
it
all
very
reasonable
is
it
in
spite
of
the
seeming
assent
she
knew
that
hepsey
was
not
convinced
and
afterward
when
she
came
into
the
room
with
the
attic
lamp
and
a
box
of
matches
the
mystery
returned
to
trouble
ruth
again
if
i
do
take
up
tatting
she
thought
as
she
went
upstairs
or
find
something
else
to
do
i
be
a
meddling
old
maid
inside
of
six
iv
a
guest
as
the
days
went
by
ruth
had
the
inevitable
reaction
at
first
the
country
brought
balm
to
her
tired
nerves
and
she
rested
luxuriously
but
she
had
not
been
at
miss
hathaway
a
fortnight
before
she
bitterly
regretted
the
step
she
had
taken
still
there
was
no
going
back
for
she
had
given
her
word
and
must
stay
there
until
october
the
months
before
her
stretched
out
into
a
dreary
waste
she
thought
of
miss
ainslie
gratefully
as
a
redeeming
feature
but
she
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
spend
all
of
her
time
in
the
house
it
the
foot
of
the
hill
half
past
six
had
seemed
an
unearthly
hour
for
breakfast
and
yet
more
than
once
ruth
had
been
downstairs
at
five
before
hepsey
was
stiring
there
was
no
rest
to
be
had
anywhere
even
after
a
long
walk
through
the
woods
and
fields
inaction
became
irritation
and
each
day
was
filled
with
a
thousand
unbearable
annoyances
she
was
fretful
moody
and
restless
always
wishing
herself
back
in
the
office
yet
knowing
that
she
could
not
do
good
work
even
if
she
were
there
she
sat
in
her
room
one
afternoon
frankly
miserable
when
hepsey
stalked
in
unannounced
and
gave
her
a
card
mr
carl
winfield
ruth
repeated
aloud
some
one
to
see
me
hepsey
she
asked
in
astonishment
yes
he
on
the
did
you
ask
him
to
come
in
no
miss
hathaway
she
do
want
no
strangers
in
her
go
down
immediately
commanded
ruth
sternly
ask
him
into
the
parlour
and
say
that
miss
thorne
will
be
down
in
a
few
hepsey
shuffled
downstairs
with
comfortable
leisure
opened
the
door
with
aggravating
slowness
then
said
in
a
harsh
tone
that
reached
the
upper
rooms
distinctly
miss
thorne
she
says
that
you
can
come
in
and
set
in
the
parlour
till
she
comes
thank
you
responded
a
masculine
voice
in
quiet
amusement
miss
thorne
is
kind
and
ruth
cheeks
flushed
hotly
i
do
know
whether
miss
thorne
will
go
down
or
not
she
said
to
herself
it
probably
a
she
rocked
pensively
for
a
minute
or
two
wondering
what
would
happen
if
she
did
not
go
down
there
was
no
sound
from
the
parlour
save
a
subdued
clearing
of
the
throat
he
getting
ready
to
speak
his
piece
she
thought
and
he
might
as
well
do
it
now
as
to
wait
for
though
she
loathed
carl
winfield
and
his
errand
whatever
it
might
prove
to
be
she
stopped
before
her
mirror
long
enough
to
give
a
pat
or
two
to
her
rebellious
hair
on
the
way
down
she
determined
to
be
dignified
icy
and
crushing
a
tall
young
fellow
with
a
pleasant
face
rose
to
greet
her
as
she
entered
the
room
miss
thorne
he
inquired
yes
please
sit
down
i
am
very
sorry
that
my
maid
should
have
been
so
it
was
not
what
she
had
meant
to
say
oh
that
all
right
he
replied
easily
i
quite
enjoyed
it
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
coming
to
you
in
this
abrupt
way
but
carlton
gave
me
a
letter
to
you
and
i
lost
carlton
was
the
managing
editor
and
vague
expectations
of
a
summons
to
the
office
came
into
ruth
mind
i
on
the
herald
he
went
on
that
is
i
was
until
my
eyes
gave
out
and
then
they
did
want
me
any
more
newspapers
ca
use
anybody
out
of
repair
he
added
grimly
i
know
ruth
answered
nodding
of
course
the
office
is
a
sanitarium
though
they
need
that
kind
of
an
annex
nor
yet
a
literary
kindergarten
which
i
known
it
to
be
taken
for
but
well
i
wo
tell
you
my
troubles
the
oculist
said
i
must
go
to
the
country
for
six
months
stay
outdoors
and
neither
read
nor
write
i
went
to
see
carlton
and
he
promised
me
a
berth
in
the
fall
they
going
to
have
a
morning
edition
too
you
miss
thorne
did
not
know
but
she
was
much
interested
carlton
advised
me
to
come
up
here
resumed
winfield
he
said
you
were
here
and
that
you
were
going
back
in
the
fall
i
sorry
i
lost
his
what
was
in
it
inquired
ruth
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
you
read
it
did
you
of
course
i
read
it
that
is
i
tried
to
the
thing
looked
like
a
prescription
but
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
it
out
it
was
principally
a
description
of
the
desolation
in
the
office
since
you
left
it
at
the
end
there
was
a
line
or
two
commending
me
to
your
tender
mercies
and
here
i
commending
now
what
in
the
dickens
have
i
done
thought
winfield
that
it
exactly
miss
thorne
i
lost
my
reference
and
i
doing
my
best
to
create
a
good
impression
without
it
i
thought
that
as
long
as
we
were
going
to
be
on
the
same
paper
and
were
both
exiles
he
paused
and
she
finished
the
sentence
for
him
that
you
come
to
see
me
how
long
have
you
been
in
town
town
is
good
he
said
i
arrived
in
this
desolate
spot
just
ten
days
ago
until
now
i
hunted
and
fished
every
day
but
i
did
get
anything
but
a
cold
it
was
very
good
of
its
kind
i
could
speak
above
a
whisper
for
three
she
had
already
recognised
him
as
the
young
man
she
saw
standing
in
the
road
the
day
she
went
to
miss
ainslie
and
mentally
asked
his
pardon
for
thinking
he
was
a
he
might
become
a
pleasant
acquaintance
for
he
was
tall
clean
shaven
and
well
built
his
hands
were
white
and
shapely
and
he
was
well
groomed
though
not
in
the
least
foppish
the
troublesome
eyes
were
dark
brown
sheltered
by
a
pair
of
tinted
glasses
his
face
was
very
expressive
responding
readily
to
every
change
of
mood
they
talked
shop
for
a
time
discovering
many
mutual
friends
and
ruth
liked
him
he
spoke
easily
though
hurriedly
and
appeared
to
be
somewhat
cynical
but
she
rightly
attributed
it
to
restlessness
like
her
own
what
are
you
going
to
do
on
the
tribune
she
asked
anything
he
answered
with
an
indefinable
shrug
not
to
reason
why
theirs
but
to
do
and
die
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
same
replied
ruth

and
the
kitchen
with
aunt
jenny
he
laughed
infectiously
i
wish
carlton
could
hear
you
say
i
do
returned
ruth
colouring
faintly
why
are
you
afraid
of
him
certainly
i
am
if
he
speaks
to
me
i
instantly
stiff
with
oh
he
is
so
bad
said
winfield
reassuringly
he
naturally
abrupt
that
all
and
i
venture
he
does
suspect
that
he
has
any
influence
over
you
i
never
fancy
that
you
were
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
on
i
not
afraid
of
anything
else
she
answered
except
burglars
and
green
carlton
would
enjoy
the
classification
really
miss
thorne
somebody
should
tell
him
do
you
think
so
much
innocent
pleasure
often
come
into
the
day
of
a
busy
for
a
moment
ruth
was
angry
and
then
all
at
once
she
knew
winfield
as
if
he
had
always
been
her
friend
conventionality
years
and
the
veneer
of
society
were
lightly
laid
upon
one
who
would
always
be
a
boy
some
men
are
old
at
twenty
but
winfield
would
be
young
at
seventy
you
can
tell
him
if
you
want
to
ruth
rejoined
calmly
he
be
so
pleased
that
he
double
your
salary
on
the
and
you
he
asked
his
eyes
twinkling
with
fun
i
be
pensioned
of
you
all
right
he
returned
but
i
guess
i
wo
tell
him
riches
lead
to
temptation
and
if
i
going
to
be
on
the
tribune
i
hate
to
have
you
hepsey
appeared
to
have
a
great
deal
of
employment
in
the
and
was
very
quiet
about
it
with
long
pauses
between
her
leisurely
movements
winfield
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
but
it
jarred
upon
ruth
and
she
was
relieved
when
he
said
he
must
go
you
come
again
wo
you
she
asked
i
will
she
stood
at
the
window
unconsciously
watching
him
as
he
went
down
the
hill
with
a
long
free
stride
she
liked
the
strength
in
his
broad
shoulders
his
well
modulated
voice
and
his
clear
honest
eyes
but
after
all
he
was
nothing
but
a
boy
miss
thorne
said
hepsey
at
her
elbow
is
that
your
beau
it
was
not
impertinence
but
sheer
friendly
interest
which
could
not
be
mistaken
for
anything
else
no
she
answered
of
course
he
real
ai
he
have
you
got
your
eye
on
anybody
else
then
miss
thorne
i
do
know
you
could
do
perhaps
she
was
thinking
and
spoke
mechanically
from
where
she
stood
she
could
still
see
him
walking
rapidly
down
the
hill
ai
you
never
seen
him
before
miss
thorne
turned
hepsey
she
said
coldly
please
go
into
the
kitchen
and
attend
to
your
work
and
the
next
time
i
have
company
please
stay
in
the
kitchen
not
in
the
yes
replied
hepsey
meekly
hastening
to
obey
she
was
not
subtle
but
she
understood
that
in
some
way
she
had
offended
miss
thorne
and
racked
her
brain
vainly
she
had
said
nothing
that
she
would
not
have
said
to
miss
hathaway
and
had
intended
nothing
but
friendliness
as
for
her
being
in
the
why
very
often
when
miss
hathaway
had
company
she
was
called
in
to
give
her
version
of
some
bit
of
village
gossip
miss
hathaway
scolded
her
when
she
was
displeased
but
never
before
had
any
one
spoken
to
hepsey
in
a
measured
icy
tone
that
was
at
once
and
commanding
tears
came
into
her
eyes
for
she
was
sensitive
after
all
a
step
sounded
overhead
and
hepsey
regained
her
she
had
heard
nearly
all
of
the
conversation
and
could
have
told
miss
thorne
a
great
deal
about
the
young
man
for
instance
he
had
not
said
that
he
was
boarding
at
joe
across
the
road
from
miss
ainslie
and
that
he
intended
to
stay
all
summer
she
could
have
told
her
of
an
uncertain
temper
peculiar
tastes
and
of
a
silver
which
joe
had
promised
her
a
glimpse
of
before
the
visitor
went
back
to
the
city
but
she
decided
to
let
miss
thorne
go
on
in
her
blind
ignorance
ruth
meanwhile
was
meditating
with
an
aggravated
restlessness
the
momentary
glimpse
of
the
outer
world
had
stung
her
into
a
sense
of
her
isolation
which
she
realised
even
more
keenly
than
before
it
was
because
of
this
she
told
herself
that
she
hoped
winfield
liked
her
for
it
was
not
her
wont
to
care
about
such
trifles
he
thought
of
her
idly
as
a
nice
girl
who
was
rather
pretty
when
she
was
interested
in
anything
but
with
a
woman
insight
influenced
insensibly
by
comment
ruth
scented
possibilities
she
wanted
him
to
like
her
to
stay
in
that
miserable
village
as
long
as
she
did
and
keep
her
mind
from
stagnation
her
thought
went
no
further
than
that
in
october
when
they
went
back
she
would
thank
carlton
prettily
for
sending
her
a
friend
provided
they
did
not
quarrel
she
could
see
long
days
of
intimate
companionship
of
that
exalted
kind
which
is
possible
only
when
man
and
woman
meet
on
a
high
plane
both
too
old
for
nonsense
she
thought
and
then
a
sudden
fear
struck
her
that
winfield
might
be
several
years
younger
than
she
was
immediately
she
despised
herself
i
do
care
if
he
is
she
thought
with
her
cheeks
crimson
it
nothing
to
me
he
a
nice
boy
and
i
want
to
be
she
went
to
her
dresser
took
out
the
large
top
drawer
and
dumped
its
contents
on
the
bed
it
was
a
desperate
measure
for
ruth
hated
to
put
things
in
order
the
newspaper
which
had
lain
in
the
bottom
of
it
had
fallen
out
also
and
she
shook
it
so
violently
that
she
tore
it
then
ribbons
handkerchiefs
stocks
gloves
and
collars
were
unceremoniously
hustled
back
into
the
drawer
for
miss
thorne
was
at
odds
with
herself
and
the
world
she
was
angry
with
hepsey
she
hated
winfield
and
despised
herself
she
picked
up
a
scrap
of
paper
which
lay
on
a
glove
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
unfamiliar
penmanship
it
was
apparently
the
end
of
a
letter
and
the
rest
of
it
was
gone
at
gibraltar
for
some
time
she
read
keeping
a
shop
but
will
probably
be
found
now
in
some
small
town
on
the
coast
of
italy
very
truly
the
signature
had
been
torn
off
why
that
is
mine
she
thought
it
must
be
something
of
aunt
another
bit
of
paper
lay
near
it
and
unthinkingly
she
read
a
letter
which
was
not
meant
for
her
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
it
began
for
understanding
me
i
could
not
put
it
into
words
but
i
believe
you
know
perhaps
you
think
it
is
useless
that
it
is
too
late
but
if
it
was
i
would
know
you
have
been
very
kind
and
i
thank
there
was
neither
date
address
nor
signature
the
message
stood
alone
as
absolutely
as
some
star
whose
light
could
not
be
seen
from
the
earth
some
one
understood
it
two
understood
it
the
writer
and
aunt
jane
ruth
put
it
back
under
the
paper
with
the
scrap
of
the
other
letter
and
closed
the
drawer
with
a
bang
i
hope
she
said
to
herself
that
while
i
stay
here
i
be
mercifully
preserved
from
finding
things
that
are
none
of
my
then
as
in
a
lightning
flash
for
an
instant
she
saw
clearly
fate
plays
us
many
tricks
and
assumes
strange
forms
but
ruth
knew
that
some
day
on
that
new
england
hill
she
would
come
face
to
face
with
a
destiny
that
had
been
ordained
from
the
beginning
something
waited
for
her
there
some
great
change
she
trembled
at
the
thought
but
was
not
afraid
the
rumours
of
the
valley
miss
thorne
said
hepsey
from
the
doorway
of
ruth
room
that
feller
here
there
was
an
unconscious
emphasis
on
the
last
word
and
ruth
herself
was
somewhat
surprised
for
she
had
not
expected
another
call
so
soon
he
in
the
parlour
continued
hepsey
when
he
around
it
and
wearin
out
the
carpet
i
did
come
up
when
he
first
come
on
account
of
my
pie
crust
bein
all
ready
to
put
in
the
how
long
has
he
been
here
asked
ruth
dabbing
a
bit
of
powder
on
her
nose
and
selecting
a
fresh
collar
oh
half
an
that
is
right
hepsey
when
anyone
comes
you
must
tell
me
immediately
never
mind
the
pie
crust
next
ruth
endeavoured
to
speak
kindly
but
she
was
irritated
at
the
necessity
of
making
another
apology
when
she
went
down
winfield
dismissed
her
excuses
with
a
comprehensive
wave
of
the
hand
i
always
have
to
wait
when
i
go
to
call
on
a
girl
he
said
it
one
of
the
most
charming
vagaries
of
the
i
used
to
think
that
perhaps
i
was
popular
but
every
fellow
i
know
has
the
same
i
an
exception
explained
ruth
i
never
keep
any
one
waiting
of
my
own
volition
that
is
she
added
hastily
feeling
his
unspoken
comment
i
came
up
this
afternoon
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
he
began
wo
you
go
for
a
walk
with
me
it
wrong
to
stay
indoors
on
a
day
like
wait
till
i
get
my
hat
said
ruth
rising
fifteen
minutes
is
the
limit
he
called
to
her
as
she
went
upstairs
she
was
back
again
almost
immediately
and
hepsey
watched
them
in
astonishment
as
they
went
down
hill
together
for
it
was
not
in
her
code
of
manners
that
walking
out
should
begin
so
soon
when
they
approached
miss
ainslie
he
pointed
out
the
brown
house
across
from
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
yonder
palatial
mansion
is
my
present
lodging
he
volunteered
and
i
am
a
helpless
fly
in
the
web
of
the
pendleton
repeated
ruth
why
that
joe
it
is
returned
winfield
concisely
he
sits
opposite
me
at
the
table
and
wonders
at
my
use
of
a
fork
it
is
considered
merely
a
spear
for
bread
and
meat
at
the
i
am
observed
closely
at
all
times
and
in
some
respects
joe
admires
me
enough
to
attempt
imitation
which
as
you
know
is
the
highest
form
of
flattery
for
instance
this
morning
he
wore
not
only
a
collar
and
tie
but
a
scarf
pin
it
was
a
string
tie
and
i
never
before
seen
a
pin
worn
in
one
but
it
must
he
has
a
sweetheart
winfield
went
on
and
i
expect
she
be
my
hepsey
is
his
lady
love
ruth
explained
what
the
haughty
damsel
who
would
let
me
in
do
tell
you
imitating
now
laughed
ruth
but
i
should
call
it
for
a
moment
there
was
a
chilly
silence
ruth
did
not
look
at
him
but
she
bit
her
lip
and
then
laughed
unwillingly
all
true
she
said
i
plead
you
see
i
know
all
about
you
he
went
on
you
knit
your
brows
in
deep
thought
do
not
hear
when
you
are
spoken
to
even
in
a
loud
voice
and
your
mail
consists
almost
entirely
of
bulky
envelopes
of
a
legal
nature
such
as
came
to
the
pendleton
from
the
insurance
returned
manuscripts
she
interjected
possibly
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
they
not
why
i
had
you
do
mean
it
she
exclaimed
ironically
you
seek
out
as
if
by
instinct
the
only
crazy
person
in
the
village
and
come
home
greatly
perturbed
you
ask
queer
questions
of
your
humble
assume
a
skirt
which
is
shorter
than
the
approved
model
speaking
from
the
village
standpoint
and
unhesitatingly
appear
on
the
public
streets
you
go
to
the
attic
at
night
and
search
the
inmost
recesses
of
many
old
yes
sighed
ruth
i
done
all
at
breakfast
you
refuse
pie
and
complain
because
the
coffee
is
boiled
did
anybody
ever
hear
of
coffee
that
was
boiled
is
it
eaten
raw
in
the
city
you
call
supper
and
have
been
known
to
seek
nourishment
at
nine
at
night
when
all
respectable
people
are
sound
asleep
in
your
trunk
you
have
vainly
attempted
to
conceal
a
large
metal
object
the
use
of
which
is
oh
my
hapless
groaned
ruth
repeated
winfield
brightening
visibly
and
i
eating
sole
leather
and
fried
potatoes
from
this
hour
i
am
your
slave
you
ca
lose
me
now
go
on
she
commanded
i
ca
the
flow
of
my
eloquence
is
stopped
by
rapturous
anticipation
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
people
of
this
enterprising
city
are
well
up
in
the
ways
of
the
wicked
world
for
the
storekeeper
takes
the
new
york
weekly
and
the
pendleton
subscribes
for
the
fireside
companion
the
back
numbers
which
are
not
worn
out
are
the
circulating
library
of
the
village
it
no
use
miss
thorne
you
might
stand
on
your
hilltop
and
proclaim
your
innocence
until
you
were
hoarse
and
it
would
be
utterly
without
effect
your
status
is
definitely
how
about
aunt
jane
she
inquired
does
my
relationship
count
for
naught
now
you
are
rapidly
approaching
the
centre
of
things
replied
the
young
man
miss
hathaway
is
one
woman
in
a
thousand
though
somewhat
eccentric
she
is
the
venerated
pillar
of
the
community
and
a
constant
attendant
it
church
which
it
seems
you
are
not
also
if
you
are
really
her
niece
where
is
the
family
resemblance
why
has
she
never
spoken
of
you
why
have
you
never
been
here
before
why
are
her
letters
to
you
sealed
with
red
wax
bought
especially
for
the
purpose
why
does
she
go
away
before
you
come
lady
gwendolen
hetherington
he
demanded
with
melodramatic
fervour
answer
me
these
things
if
you
can
i
tired
she
complained
delicate
compliment
observed
winfield
apparently
to
himself
a
log
across
our
path
miss
thorne
let
sit
the
budded
maples
arched
over
the
narrow
path
and
a
wild
canary
singing
in
the
sun
hopped
from
bough
to
bough
a
robin
cheery
chirp
came
from
another
tree
and
the
clear
notes
of
a
thrush
with
a
mottled
breast
were
answered
by
another
in
the
aisles
beyond
oh
he
said
under
his
breath
is
this
great
the
exquisite
peace
of
the
forest
was
like
that
of
another
sphere
yes
she
answered
softly
it
is
you
evading
the
original
subject
he
suggested
a
little
later
i
have
had
a
chance
to
talk
she
explained
you
done
a
monologue
ever
since
we
left
the
house
and
i
listened
as
becomes
inferior
and
subordinate
woman
i
have
never
seen
my
venerated
kinswoman
and
i
do
see
how
she
happened
to
think
of
me
nevertheless
when
she
wrote
asking
me
to
take
charge
of
her
house
while
she
went
to
europe
i
gladly
consented
sight
unseen
when
i
came
she
was
gone
i
do
not
deny
the
short
skirt
and
heavy
shoes
the
criticism
of
boiled
coffee
nor
the
disdain
of
breakfast
pie
as
far
is
i
know
aunt
jane
is
my
only
living
that
good
he
said
cheerfully
i
shy
even
of
an
aunt
why
should
the
orphans
console
one
another
they
should
admitted
ruth
and
you
are
doing
your
share
permit
me
to
return
the
compliment
honestly
miss
thorne
he
continued
seriously
you
have
no
idea
how
much
i
appreciate
your
being
here
when
i
first
realised
what
it
meant
to
be
deprived
of
books
and
papers
for
six
months
at
a
stretch
it
seemed
as
if
i
should
go
mad
still
i
suppose
six
months
is
as
bad
as
forever
and
i
was
given
a
choice
i
do
want
to
bore
you
but
if
you
will
let
me
come
occasionally
i
shall
be
very
glad
i
going
to
try
to
be
patient
too
if
you
help
me
patience
is
my
long
indeed
i
will
help
you
answered
ruth
impulsively
i
know
how
hard
it
must
i
not
begging
for
your
sympathy
though
i
assure
you
it
is
he
polished
the
tinted
glasses
with
a
bit
of
and
his
eyes
filled
with
the
mist
of
weakness
before
he
put
them
on
again
so
never
seen
your
aunt
he
said
no
that
pleasure
is
still
in
store
for
they
say
down
at
the
that
she
a
woman
with
a
tell
me
about
it
exclaimed
ruth
eagerly
little
girls
must
ask
questions
he
remarked
patronisingly
and
in
his
most
irritating
manner
besides
i
do
know
if
the
knows
she
wo
tell
so
it
fair
to
suppose
she
does
your
relation
does
queer
things
in
the
attic
and
every
spring
she
has
an
annual
weep
i
suppose
it
the
house
cleaning
for
the
rest
of
the
year
she
and
i
weep
very
frequently
commented
ruth
idle
tears
i
wonder
what
they
mean
they
do
mean
much
in
the
case
of
a
i
never
seen
many
returned
winfield
and
i
do
want
to
even
stage
tears
go
against
the
grain
with
me
i
know
that
the
lady
who
sobs
behind
the
footlights
is
well
paid
for
it
but
all
the
same
it
gives
me
the
it
nothing
serious
really
it
is
she
explained
it
merely
a
safety
valve
if
women
could
cry
they
i
always
supposed
tears
were
signs
of
sorrow
he
said
far
from
it
laughed
ruth
when
i
get
very
angry
i
cry
and
then
i
got
angrier
because
i
crying
and
cry
that
opens
up
a
fearful
possibility
what
would
happen
if
you
kept
getting
angrier
because
you
were
crying
and
crying
harder
because
you
got
angrier
i
have
no
idea
she
answered
with
her
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
but
it
a
promising
field
for
i
do
want
to
see
the
do
worry
said
ruth
laconically
you
there
was
a
long
silence
and
winfield
began
to
draw
designs
on
the
bare
earth
with
a
twig
tell
me
about
the
lady
who
is
considered
crazy
he
suggested
ruth
briefly
described
miss
ainslie
dwelling
lovingly
upon
her
beauty
and
charm
he
listened
indifferently
at
first
but
when
she
told
him
of
the
rugs
the
real
lace
which
edged
the
curtains
and
the
cloisonne
vase
he
became
much
interested
take
me
to
see
her
some
day
wo
you
he
asked
carelessly
ruth
eyes
met
his
squarely
is
a
she
said
resentfully
forgetting
her
own
temptation
the
dull
colour
flooded
his
face
you
forget
miss
thorne
that
i
am
forbidden
to
read
or
for
six
months
only
answered
ruth
sternly
and
there
always
a
place
for
a
good
sunday
he
changed
the
subject
but
there
were
frequent
awkward
pauses
and
the
spontaniety
was
gone
she
rose
adjusting
her
belt
in
the
back
and
announced
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
home
on
their
way
up
the
hill
she
tried
to
be
gracious
enough
to
atone
for
her
rudeness
but
though
he
was
politeness
itself
there
was
a
difference
and
she
felt
as
if
she
had
lost
something
distance
lay
between
them
a
cold
immeasurable
distance
yet
she
knew
that
she
had
done
right
he
opened
the
gate
for
her
then
turned
to
go
wo
you
come
in
she
asked
conventionally
no
thank
you
some
other
time
if
i
may
i
had
a
charming
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
was
off
down
the
hill
when
she
remembered
that
it
was
a
winfield
who
had
married
abigail
weatherby
she
dismissed
the
matter
as
mere
coincidence
and
determined
at
all
costs
to
shield
miss
ainslie
the
vision
of
that
gracious
lady
came
to
her
bringing
with
it
a
certain
uplift
of
soul
instantly
she
was
placed
far
above
the
petty
concerns
of
earth
like
one
who
walks
upon
the
heights
untroubled
while
restless
surges
thunder
at
his
feet
vi
the
garden
miss
thorne
wrote
an
apology
to
winfield
and
then
tore
it
up
thereby
gaining
comparative
peace
of
mind
for
with
some
natures
expression
is
the
main
thing
and
direction
is
but
secondary
she
was
not
surprised
because
he
did
not
come
on
the
contrary
she
had
rather
expected
to
be
left
to
her
own
devices
for
a
time
but
one
afternoon
she
dressed
with
unusual
care
and
sat
in
state
in
the
parlour
vaguely
expectant
if
he
intended
to
be
friendly
it
was
certainly
time
for
him
to
come
again
hepsey
passing
through
the
hall
noted
the
crisp
white
ribbon
at
her
throat
and
the
bow
in
her
hair
are
you
expectin
company
miss
thorne
she
asked
innocently
i
am
expecting
no
one
answered
ruth
frigidly
i
am
going
feeling
obliged
to
make
her
word
good
she
took
the
path
which
led
to
miss
ainslie
as
she
entered
the
gate
she
had
a
glimpse
of
winfield
sitting
by
the
front
window
of
pendleton
brown
house
in
such
a
dejected
attitude
that
she
pitied
him
she
considered
the
virtuous
emotion
very
praiseworthy
even
though
it
was
not
deep
enough
for
her
to
bestow
a
cheery
nod
upon
the
gloomy
person
across
the
way
miss
ainslie
was
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
her
and
ruth
sank
into
an
easy
chair
with
something
like
content
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
insensibly
soothing
and
she
instantly
felt
a
subtle
change
miss
ainslie
as
always
wore
a
lavender
gown
with
real
lace
at
the
throat
and
wrists
her
white
hair
was
waved
softly
and
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
was
a
ring
of
roman
gold
set
with
an
amethyst
and
two
large
pearls
there
was
a
beautiful
serenity
about
her
evident
in
every
line
of
her
face
and
figure
time
had
dealt
gently
with
her
and
except
on
her
queenly
head
had
left
no
trace
of
his
passing
the
delicate
scent
of
the
lavender
floated
from
her
gown
and
her
laces
almost
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
her
and
brought
visions
of
an
garden
whose
gentle
mistress
was
ever
tranquil
and
content
as
she
sat
there
smiling
she
might
have
been
peace
grown
old
miss
ainslie
said
ruth
suddenly
have
you
ever
had
any
trouble
a
shadow
crossed
her
face
and
then
she
answered
patiently
why
yes
i
had
my
i
do
mean
to
be
personal
ruth
explained
i
was
just
i
understand
said
the
other
gently
then
after
a
little
she
spoke
again
we
all
have
trouble
deary
it
part
of
life
but
i
believe
that
we
all
share
equally
in
the
joy
of
the
world
allowing
for
temperament
i
mean
sorrows
that
would
crush
some
are
lightly
borne
by
others
and
some
have
the
gift
of
finding
great
happiness
in
little
things
then
too
we
never
have
any
more
than
we
can
bear
nothing
that
has
not
been
borne
before
and
bravely
at
that
there
is
a
new
sorrow
in
the
world
they
all
old
ones
but
we
can
all
find
new
happiness
if
we
look
in
the
right
the
voice
had
a
full
music
instinct
with
tenderness
and
gradually
ruth
troubled
spirit
was
eased
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
she
said
meditatively
for
i
not
morbid
and
i
do
have
the
blues
very
often
but
almost
ever
since
i
been
at
aunt
jane
been
restless
and
disturbed
i
know
there
no
reason
for
it
but
i
ca
help
do
you
think
that
it
because
you
have
nothing
to
do
you
always
been
so
busy
and
you
are
used
to
perhaps
so
i
miss
my
work
but
at
the
same
time
i
have
sense
enough
to
do
poor
child
you
tired
too
tired
to
yes
i
am
tired
answered
ruth
the
tears
of
nervous
weakness
coming
into
her
eyes
come
out
into
the
miss
ainslie
drew
a
fleecy
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
led
her
guest
outdoors
though
she
kept
pace
with
the
world
in
many
other
ways
it
was
an
garden
with
a
and
an
arbour
and
little
paths
nicely
kept
that
led
to
the
flower
beds
and
circled
around
them
there
were
no
flowers
as
yet
except
in
a
bed
of
wild
violets
under
a
bay
window
but
tiny
sprigs
of
green
were
everywhere
eloquent
with
promise
and
the
lilacs
were
budded
that
a
snowball
bush
over
there
said
miss
ainslie
and
all
that
corner
of
the
garden
will
be
full
of
roses
in
june
roses
that
i
expect
you
would
care
and
cinnamon
and
sweet
briar
but
i
love
them
all
that
long
row
is
half
peonies
and
half
and
i
have
a
bed
of
columbines
under
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
the
mignonette
and
have
a
place
to
themselves
for
i
think
they
belong
together
sweetness
and
memory
there
going
to
be
over
there
miss
ainslie
went
on
and
sweet
william
the
porch
is
always
covered
with
i
think
they
beautiful
and
in
that
large
bed
i
planted
poppies
and
marigolds
this
round
one
is
full
of
larkspur
and
bachelor
buttons
i
have
phlox
and
petunias
too
did
you
ever
see
a
petunia
seed
ruth
shook
her
head
it
the
tiniest
thing
smaller
than
a
grain
of
sand
when
i
plant
them
i
always
wonder
how
those
great
feathery
petunias
are
coming
out
of
those
little
baby
seeds
but
they
come
over
there
are
things
that
wo
blossom
till
late
asters
and
prince
feather
going
to
be
a
beautiful
garden
deary
down
by
the
gate
are
my
sweet
herbs
and
simples
marjoram
sweet
thyme
rosemary
and
lavender
i
love
the
lavender
do
you
yes
i
do
replied
ruth
but
i
never
seen
it
it
a
little
bush
with
lavender
flowers
that
yield
honey
and
all
sweet
flowers
leaves
and
all
i
expect
you
laugh
at
me
but
i
planted
sunflowers
and
and
i
wo
laugh
think
it
lovely
what
do
you
like
best
miss
ainslie
i
love
them
all
she
said
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
her
deep
unfathomable
eyes
fixed
upon
ruth
but
i
think
the
lavender
comes
first
it
so
sweet
and
then
it
has
associations
she
paused
in
confusion
and
ruth
went
on
quickly
i
think
they
all
have
associations
and
that
why
we
love
them
i
ca
bear
red
geraniums
because
a
cross
old
woman
i
knew
when
i
was
a
child
had
her
yard
full
of
them
and
i
shall
always
love
the
lavender
she
added
softly
because
it
makes
me
think
of
miss
ainslie
checks
flushed
and
her
eyes
shone
now
we
go
into
the
house
she
said
and
we
have
i
should
stay
any
longer
murmured
ruth
following
her
i
been
here
so
long
is
long
contradicted
miss
ainslie
sweetly
it
been
only
a
very
few
every
moment
the
house
and
its
owner
took
on
new
beauty
and
charm
miss
ainslie
spread
a
napkin
of
finest
damask
upon
the
little
mahogany
tea
table
then
brought
in
a
silver
teapot
of
quaint
design
and
two
cups
of
japanese
china
dainty
to
the
point
of
fragility
why
miss
ainslie
exclaimed
ruth
in
surprise
where
did
you
get
royal
kaga
miss
ainslie
was
bending
over
the
table
and
the
white
hand
that
held
the
teapot
trembled
a
little
they
were
a
present
from
a
friend
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
they
beautiful
said
ruth
hurriedly
she
had
been
to
many
an
elaborate
affair
which
was
down
on
the
social
calendar
as
a
tea
sometimes
as
reporter
and
often
as
guest
but
she
had
found
no
hostess
like
miss
ainslie
no
china
so
exquisitely
fine
nor
any
tea
like
the
clear
fragrant
amber
which
was
poured
into
her
cup
it
came
from
china
said
miss
ainslie
feeling
the
unspoken
question
i
had
a
whole
chest
of
it
but
it
almost
all
ruth
was
turning
her
cup
and
consulting
the
oracle
here
two
people
a
man
and
a
woman
from
a
great
distance
and
yes
here
money
too
what
is
there
in
yours
nothing
deary
and
besides
it
does
come
when
ruth
finally
aroused
herself
to
go
home
the
old
restlessness
for
the
moment
was
gone
there
a
charm
about
you
she
said
for
i
feel
as
if
i
could
sleep
a
whole
week
and
never
wake
at
it
the
tea
smiled
miss
ainslie
for
i
a
very
commonplace
you
commonplace
repeated
ruth
why
there
nobody
like
you
they
stood
at
the
door
a
few
moments
talking
aimlessly
but
ruth
was
watching
miss
ainslie
face
as
the
sunset
light
lay
caressingly
upon
it
i
had
a
lovely
time
she
said
taking
another
step
toward
the
gate
so
have
i
you
come
again
wo
you
the
sweet
voice
was
pleading
now
and
ruth
answered
it
in
her
inmost
soul
impulsively
she
came
back
threw
her
arms
around
miss
ainslie
neck
and
kissed
her
i
love
you
she
said
do
you
know
i
do
the
quick
tears
filled
miss
ainslie
eyes
and
she
smiled
through
the
mist
thank
you
deary
she
whispered
it
a
long
time
since
any
one
has
kissed
me
a
long
time
ruth
turned
back
at
the
gate
to
wave
her
hand
and
even
at
that
distance
saw
that
miss
ainslie
was
very
pale
winfield
was
waiting
for
her
just
outside
the
hedge
but
his
presence
jarred
upon
her
strangely
and
her
salutation
was
not
cordial
is
the
lady
a
friend
of
yours
he
inquired
indifferently
she
is
returned
ruth
i
do
go
to
see
my
enemies
do
you
i
do
know
whether
i
do
or
not
he
said
looking
at
her
significantly
her
colour
rose
but
she
replied
sharply
for
the
sake
of
peace
let
us
assume
that
you
do
miss
thorne
he
began
as
they
climbed
the
hill
i
do
see
why
you
do
apply
something
cooling
to
your
feverish
temper
you
have
to
live
with
yourself
all
the
time
you
know
and
occasionally
it
must
be
very
difficult
a
rag
now
wet
in
cold
water
and
tied
around
your
neck
have
you
ever
tried
that
it
said
to
be
very
i
have
one
on
now
she
answered
with
apparent
seriousness
only
you
ca
see
it
under
my
ribbon
it
getting
dry
and
i
think
i
better
hurry
home
to
wet
it
again
do
you
winfield
laughed
joyously
you
do
he
said
before
they
were
half
up
the
hill
they
were
on
good
terms
again
i
do
want
to
go
home
do
you
he
asked
home
i
have
no
home
i
only
a
poor
working
oh
what
would
this
be
with
music
i
can
see
it
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
your
kind
permission
i
will
endeavour
to
give
you
a
little
song
of
my
own
composition
entitled
has
the
working
girl
no
home
you
have
my
permission
and
you
a
i
am
he
admitted
cheerfully
moreover
i
a
worm
in
the
i
do
like
then
you
have
to
ruth
resented
his
calm
assumption
of
mastery
you
dreadfully
young
she
said
do
you
think
you
ever
grow
up
huh
returned
winfield
boyishly
i
most
really
i
should
have
thought
you
were
of
here
a
side
path
miss
thorne
he
said
abruptly
that
seems
to
go
down
into
the
woods
shall
we
explore
it
wo
be
dark
for
an
hour
they
descended
with
some
difficulty
since
the
way
was
not
cleat
and
came
into
the
woods
at
a
point
not
far
from
the
log
across
the
path
we
must
sit
there
any
more
he
observed
or
we
fight
that
where
we
were
the
other
day
when
you
attempted
to
assassinate
i
did
exclaimed
ruth
indignantly
that
rag
does
seem
to
be
pretty
dry
he
said
apparently
to
himself
perhaps
when
we
get
to
the
sad
sea
we
can
wet
it
and
so
insure
comparative
she
laughed
reluctantly
the
path
led
around
the
hill
and
down
from
the
highlands
to
a
narrow
ledge
of
beach
that
lay
under
the
cliff
do
you
want
to
drown
me
she
asked
it
looks
very
much
as
if
you
intended
to
for
this
ledge
is
covered
at
high
you
wrong
me
miss
thorne
i
have
never
drowned
his
answer
was
lost
upon
her
for
she
stood
on
the
beach
under
the
cliff
looking
at
the
water
the
shimmering
turquoise
blue
was
slowly
changing
to
grey
and
a
single
sea
gull
circled
overhead
he
made
two
or
three
observations
to
which
ruth
paid
no
attention
my
lady
disdain
he
said
with
assumed
anxiety
do
you
think
better
go
on
i
do
know
what
time
the
tide
comes
in
and
i
never
could
look
your
aunt
in
the
face
if
i
had
drowned
her
only
very
well
she
replied
carelessly
let
go
around
the
other
they
followed
the
beach
until
they
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
hill
but
found
no
path
leading
back
to
civilisation
though
the
ascent
could
easily
be
made
people
have
been
here
before
he
said
here
are
some
initials
cut
into
this
stone
what
are
they
i
ca
ruth
stooped
to
look
at
the
granite
boulder
he
indicated
j
she
answered
and
it
incomplete
he
objected
there
should
be
a
heart
with
an
arrow
run
through
you
can
fix
it
to
suit
yourself
ruth
returned
coolly
i
do
think
anybody
will
she
did
not
hear
his
reply
for
it
suddenly
dawned
upon
her
that
j
meant
jane
hathaway
they
stood
there
in
the
twilight
for
some
little
time
watching
the
changing
colours
on
the
horizon
and
then
there
was
a
faint
glow
on
the
water
from
the
cliff
above
ruth
went
out
far
enough
to
see
that
hepsey
had
placed
the
lamp
in
the
attic
window
it
time
to
go
she
said
inasmuch
as
we
have
to
go
back
the
way
we
they
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
went
back
through
the
woods
it
was
dusk
and
they
walked
rapidly
until
they
came
to
the
log
across
the
path
so
your
friend
is
crazy
he
said
tentatively
as
he
tried
to
assist
her
over
it
that
depends
she
replied
drawing
away
from
him
you
forgot
to
wet
the
rag
did
we
he
asked
i
will
gladly
assume
the
implication
however
if
i
may
be
your
kind
i
sure
she
answered
with
distant
politeness
the
path
widened
and
he
walked
by
her
side
have
you
noticed
miss
thorne
that
we
have
trouble
every
time
we
approach
that
seemingly
innocent
barrier
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
keep
away
from
it
you
what
initials
were
those
on
the
boulder
and
j
i
thought
so
b
must
have
had
a
lot
of
spare
time
at
his
disposal
for
his
initials
are
cut
into
the
pendleton
gate
post
on
the
inner
side
and
into
an
apple
tree
in
the
back
how
interesting
did
you
know
joe
and
hepsey
were
going
out
no
i
did
they
not
my
intimate
i
do
see
how
joe
expects
to
marry
on
the
income
derived
from
the
village
have
they
got
that
far
i
do
know
replied
winfield
with
the
air
of
one
imparting
a
confidence
you
see
though
i
have
been
in
this
peaceful
village
for
some
little
time
i
have
not
yet
arrived
at
the
fine
distinction
between
out
up
and
i
should
infer
that
out
came
first
for
up
must
take
a
great
deal
more
courage
but
even
with
my
vast
intellect
can
not
at
present
understand
joe
takes
her
out
every
sunday
in
the
carriage
volunteered
ruth
when
the
silence
became
awkward
in
the
what
carriage
have
you
ridden
in
it
i
have
ridden
in
them
but
not
in
it
i
walked
to
the
but
if
it
is
the
conveyance
used
by
travellers
they
are
both
and
up
they
paused
at
the
gate
thank
you
for
a
pleasant
afternoon
said
winfield
i
do
have
many
of
you
welcome
returned
ruth
conveying
the
impression
of
great
distance
winfield
sighed
then
made
a
last
desperate
attempt
miss
thorne
he
said
pleadingly
please
do
be
unkind
to
me
you
have
my
reason
in
your
hands
i
can
see
myself
now
sitting
on
the
floor
at
one
end
of
the
dangerous
ward
they
smear
my
fingers
with
molasses
and
give
me
half
a
dozen
feathers
to
play
with
you
come
to
visit
the
asylum
sometime
when
you
looking
for
a
special
and
at
first
you
recognise
me
then
i
say
behold
your
work
and
you
be
miserable
all
the
rest
of
your
she
laughed
heartily
at
the
distressing
picture
and
the
plaintive
tone
of
his
voice
pierced
her
armour
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
i
do
know
i
suppose
it
my
eyes
i
horribly
restless
and
discontented
and
it
is
my
then
ruth
remembered
her
own
restless
weeks
which
seemed
so
long
ago
and
her
heart
stirred
with
womanly
sympathy
i
know
she
said
in
a
different
tone
i
felt
the
same
way
myself
almost
ever
since
been
here
until
this
very
afternoon
you
tired
and
nervous
and
you
have
anything
to
do
but
you
get
over
i
hope
you
right
i
been
getting
joe
to
read
the
papers
to
me
at
a
quarter
a
sitting
but
his
pronunciation
is
so
unfamiliar
that
hard
to
get
the
drift
and
the
whole
thing
exasperated
me
so
that
i
had
to
give
it
let
me
read
the
papers
to
you
she
said
impulsively
i
have
seen
one
for
a
there
was
a
long
silence
i
do
want
to
impose
upon
you
he
answered
no
you
must
do
ruth
saw
a
stubborn
pride
that
shrank
from
the
slightest
dependence
a
that
would
not
falter
but
would
steadfastly
hold
aloof
and
she
knew
that
in
one
thing
at
least
they
were
kindred
let
me
she
cried
eagerly
i
give
you
my
eyes
for
a
little
while
winfield
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
for
a
moment
fully
understanding
ruth
eyes
looked
up
into
his
deep
dark
dangerously
appealing
and
alight
with
generous
desire
his
fingers
unclasped
slowly
yes
i
will
he
said
strangely
moved
it
a
beautiful
gift
in
more
ways
than
one
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
good
night
vii
the
man
who
hesitates
is
fair
said
winfield
to
himself
miserably
no
sir
fair
he
sat
on
the
narrow
piazza
which
belonged
to
pendleton
brown
house
and
took
stern
account
of
his
inner
self
the
morning
paper
lay
beside
him
unopened
though
his
fingers
itched
to
tear
the
wrapper
and
his
hat
was
pulled
far
down
over
his
eyes
to
shade
them
from
the
sun
if
i
go
up
there
i
going
to
fall
in
love
with
her
and
i
know
it
that
moment
of
revelation
the
night
before
when
soul
stood
face
to
face
with
soul
had
troubled
him
strangely
he
knew
himself
for
a
sentimentalist
where
women
were
concerned
but
until
they
stood
at
the
gate
together
he
had
thought
himself
safe
like
many
another
man
on
the
sunny
side
of
thirty
he
had
his
ideal
woman
safely
enshrined
in
his
inner
consciousness
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
this
dream
maiden
a
blonde
with
deep
blue
eyes
a
rosy
complexion
and
a
mouth
like
cupid
bow
mentally
she
was
of
the
clinging
sort
for
winfield
did
not
know
that
in
this
he
was
out
of
fashion
she
had
a
dainty
air
about
her
and
a
high
sweet
voice
a
most
adorable
little
woman
truly
for
a
man
to
dream
of
when
business
was
not
too
pressing
in
almost
every
possible
way
miss
thorne
was
different
she
was
dark
and
nearly
as
tall
as
he
was
dignified
and
calm
except
for
flashes
of
temper
and
that
one
impulsive
moment
he
had
liked
her
found
her
interesting
in
a
tantalising
sort
of
way
and
looked
upon
her
as
an
oasis
in
a
social
desert
but
that
was
all
of
course
he
might
leave
the
village
but
he
made
a
wry
face
upon
discovering
through
laboured
analysis
that
he
did
want
to
go
away
it
was
really
a
charming
spot
hunting
and
fishing
to
be
had
for
the
asking
fine
accommodations
at
pendleton
beautiful
scenery
bracing
air
in
every
way
it
was
just
what
he
needed
should
he
let
himself
be
frightened
out
of
it
by
a
newspaper
woman
who
lived
at
the
top
of
the
hill
hardly
none
the
less
he
realised
that
a
man
might
firmly
believe
in
affinity
and
through
a
chain
of
unfortunate
circumstances
become
the
victim
of
propinquity
he
had
known
of
such
instances
and
was
now
face
to
face
with
the
dilemma
then
his
face
flooded
with
dull
colour
darn
it
he
said
to
himself
savagely
what
an
unmitigated
cad
i
am
all
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
she
likely
to
fall
on
my
neck
at
any
minute
lord
yet
there
was
a
certain
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
safe
even
if
he
should
fall
in
love
with
miss
thorne
that
disdainful
young
woman
would
save
him
from
himself
undoubtedly
when
he
reached
the
danger
point
if
not
before
i
wonder
how
a
fellow
would
go
about
it
anyway
he
thought
he
could
make
any
sentimental
remarks
without
being
instantly
frozen
she
like
the
boston
girls
we
read
about
in
the
funny
papers
he
could
give
her
things
either
except
flowers
or
books
or
sweets
or
music
she
has
more
books
than
she
wants
because
she
for
the
paper
and
i
do
think
she
musical
she
does
look
like
the
candy
fiends
and
i
imagine
she
pitch
a
box
of
chocolates
into
the
sad
sea
or
give
it
to
hepsey
there
nothing
left
but
flowers
and
i
suppose
she
would
a
man
would
have
to
teach
her
to
like
him
and
on
my
soul
i
know
how
he
do
that
constant
devotion
would
have
any
effect
i
doubt
if
she
permit
it
and
a
fellow
might
stay
away
from
her
for
six
months
without
a
sign
from
her
i
guess
she
cold
no
she
is
either
eyes
and
temper
like
hers
do
go
with
the
icebergs
i
that
is
he
could
take
her
out
because
there
no
place
to
go
it
different
in
the
city
of
course
but
if
he
happened
to
meet
her
in
the
country
as
i
done
might
ask
her
to
drive
possibly
if
i
could
rent
alfred
and
mamie
for
a
few
hours
no
we
have
to
have
the
day
for
anything
over
two
miles
and
that
would
be
good
form
without
a
chaperone
not
that
she
needs
one
she
equal
to
any
emergency
i
fancy
besides
she
would
go
if
i
could
get
those
two
plugs
up
the
hill
without
pushing
gravity
would
back
but
i
could
ask
her
to
walk
up
the
hill
after
the
pleasure
excursion
was
over
i
do
believe
a
drive
would
entertain
her
perhaps
she
like
to
fish
no
she
would
for
she
said
she
like
worms
might
sail
on
the
briny
deep
except
that
there
no
harbour
within
ten
miles
and
she
would
trust
her
fair
young
life
to
me
she
be
afraid
i
drown
her
i
suppose
the
main
idea
is
to
cultivate
a
clinging
dependence
but
like
to
see
the
man
who
could
woo
any
dependence
from
miss
thorne
she
holds
her
head
like
a
thoroughbred
touched
with
the
lash
she
said
she
was
afraid
of
carlton
but
i
guess
she
was
just
trying
to
be
pleasant
i
tell
him
about
it
no
i
wo
for
i
said
i
would
i
wish
there
was
some
other
girl
here
for
me
to
talk
to
but
i
be
lucky
if
i
can
get
along
peaceably
with
the
one
already
here
i
have
to
discover
all
her
pet
prejudices
and
be
careful
not
to
walk
on
any
of
there
that
crazy
woman
for
instance
i
must
allude
to
her
even
respectfully
if
i
to
have
any
softening
feminine
influence
about
me
before
i
go
back
to
town
she
did
seem
to
believe
i
had
any
letter
from
carlton
that
what
comes
of
being
careless
i
should
have
told
her
that
people
said
she
had
large
feet
and
wore
men
shoes
she
got
a
pretty
foot
i
noticed
it
particularly
before
i
spoke
i
suppose
she
did
like
that
most
girls
would
i
guess
but
she
took
it
as
a
hunter
takes
a
fence
even
after
that
she
said
help
me
be
patient
and
last
night
when
she
said
she
read
the
papers
to
me
she
was
awfully
sweet
to
me
then
perhaps
she
likes
me
a
little
bit
i
hope
so
she
never
care
very
much
for
anybody
though
she
too
independent
she
would
even
let
me
help
her
up
the
hill
i
do
know
whether
it
was
independence
or
whether
she
did
want
me
to
touch
her
if
we
ever
come
to
a
place
where
she
has
to
be
helped
i
suppose
i
have
to
put
gloves
on
or
let
her
hold
one
end
of
a
stick
while
i
hang
on
to
the
other
still
she
did
take
her
hand
away
last
night
when
i
grabbed
it
probably
she
was
thinking
about
something
else
and
did
notice
a
particularly
nice
hand
to
hold
but
i
never
have
another
chance
i
guess
carlton
said
she
take
the
conceit
out
of
me
if
i
had
any
i
glad
he
did
put
that
in
the
letter
still
it
does
matter
since
i
lost
it
i
wish
i
had
for
what
he
said
about
me
was
really
very
nice
carlton
is
a
good
fellow
how
she
lit
on
me
when
i
thought
the
crazy
person
might
make
a
good
special
jerusalem
i
felt
like
the
dust
under
her
feet
i
be
glad
to
have
anybody
stand
up
for
me
like
that
but
nobody
ever
will
mighty
pretty
when
she
angry
but
i
rather
she
would
get
huffy
at
me
she
a
tremendously
nice
girl
there
no
doubt
of
at
this
juncture
joe
came
out
on
the
porch
hat
in
hand
mornin
good
morning
joe
how
are
your
troubles
this
morning
they
ill
right
i
guess
he
replied
pleased
with
the
air
of
comradeship
want
me
to
read
the
paper
to
yer
no
thank
you
joe
not
this
the
tone
was
a
dismissal
but
joe
lingered
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
ai
i
done
it
to
suit
yer
quite
so
returned
winfield
serenely
i
do
mind
doin
it
joe
continued
after
a
long
silence
i
charge
yer
you
very
kind
joe
but
i
do
care
about
it
winfield
rose
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
porch
the
apple
trees
were
in
bloom
and
every
wandering
wind
was
laden
with
sweetness
even
the
gnarled
old
tree
in
miss
hathaway
yard
that
had
been
out
of
bearing
for
many
a
year
had
put
forth
a
bough
of
fragrant
blossoms
he
saw
it
from
where
he
stood
a
mass
of
pink
and
white
against
the
turquoise
sky
and
thought
that
miss
thorne
would
make
a
charming
picture
if
she
stood
beneath
the
tree
with
the
blown
petals
drifting
around
her
he
lingered
upon
the
vision
till
joe
spoke
again
be
you
goin
up
to
miss
hathaway
this
mornin
why
i
do
know
winfield
answered
somewhat
resentfully
why
i
would
go
not
if
i
was
in
your
why
he
demanded
facing
him
miss
hathaway
niece
she
sick
repeated
winfield
in
sudden
fear
what
the
matter
oh
ai
nothin
serious
i
reckon
cause
she
up
and
around
just
come
from
there
and
hepsey
said
that
all
night
miss
thorne
was
and
that
this
mornin
she
would
eat
no
breakfast
she
do
never
eat
much
but
this
mornin
she
would
eat
nothin
and
she
would
say
what
was
wrong
with
winfield
face
plainly
showed
his
concern
she
would
eat
nothin
last
night
neither
joe
went
on
hepsey
told
me
this
mornin
that
she
thought
you
and
her
had
fit
your
girl
ai
she
no
replied
winfield
she
is
my
girl
and
we
have
sorry
she
is
he
paced
back
and
forth
moodily
while
joe
watched
him
in
silence
well
he
said
at
length
i
reckon
i
be
movin
along
i
just
thought
i
tell
there
was
no
answer
and
joe
slammed
the
gate
in
disgust
i
wonder
what
the
matter
thought
winfield
is
a
letter
for
mail
has
come
and
she
was
all
right
last
night
perhaps
she
ill
she
said
she
cried
when
she
was
angry
great
heavens
i
hope
she
is
angry
at
me
she
was
awfully
sweet
to
me
just
before
i
left
her
he
continued
mentally
so
i
not
to
blame
i
wonder
if
she
angry
at
herself
because
she
offered
to
read
the
papers
to
me
all
unknowingly
he
had
arrived
at
the
cause
of
miss
unhappiness
during
a
wakeful
miserable
night
she
had
wished
a
thousand
times
that
she
might
take
back
those
few
impulsive
words
that
must
be
it
he
thought
and
then
his
face
grew
tender
bless
her
sweet
heart
he
muttered
apropos
of
nothing
i
not
going
to
make
her
unhappy
it
only
her
generous
impulse
and
i
wo
let
her
think
it
any
the
little
maiden
of
his
dreams
was
but
a
faint
image
just
then
as
he
sat
down
to
plan
a
course
of
action
which
would
assuage
miss
tears
a
grey
squirrel
appeared
on
the
gate
post
and
sat
there
calmly
cracking
a
nut
he
watched
the
little
creature
absently
and
then
strolled
toward
the
gate
the
squirrel
seemed
tame
and
did
not
move
until
he
was
almost
near
enough
to
touch
it
and
then
it
scampered
only
a
little
way
i
catch
it
winfield
said
to
himself
and
take
it
up
to
miss
thorne
perhaps
she
be
it
was
simple
enough
apparently
for
the
desired
gift
was
always
close
at
hand
he
followed
it
across
the
hill
and
bent
a
score
of
times
to
pick
it
up
but
it
was
a
guileful
squirrel
and
escaped
with
great
regularity
suddenly
with
a
flaunt
of
its
bushy
tail
and
a
daring
backward
glance
it
scampered
under
the
gate
into
miss
ainslie
garden
and
winfield
laughed
aloud
he
had
not
known
he
was
so
near
the
other
house
and
was
about
to
retreat
when
something
stopped
him
miss
ainslie
stood
in
the
path
just
behind
the
gate
with
her
face
ghastly
white
and
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
trembling
like
a
leaf
there
was
a
troubled
silence
then
she
said
thickly
go
i
beg
your
pardon
he
answered
hurriedly
i
did
not
mean
to
frighten
go
she
said
again
her
lips
scarcely
moving
go
now
what
in
the
mischief
have
i
done
he
thought
as
he
crept
away
feeling
like
a
thief
i
understood
that
this
was
a
quiet
place
and
yet
the
strenuous
life
seems
to
have
struck
the
village
in
good
earnest
what
am
i
that
i
should
scare
the
aged
and
make
the
young
weep
always
been
considered
harmless
till
now
that
must
be
miss
friend
whom
i
met
so
unfortunately
just
now
she
crazy
surely
or
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
me
poor
thing
perhaps
i
startled
he
remembered
that
she
had
carried
a
basket
and
worn
a
pair
of
gardening
gloves
even
though
her
face
was
so
changed
for
an
instant
he
had
seen
its
beauty
the
deep
violet
eyes
fair
skin
and
regular
features
surmounted
by
that
wonderful
crown
of
silvered
hair
conflicting
emotions
swayed
him
as
he
wended
his
way
to
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
morning
paper
in
his
pocket
as
an
excuse
if
he
should
need
one
when
he
approached
the
gate
he
was
seized
by
a
swift
and
unexplainable
fear
and
would
have
turned
back
but
miss
hathaway
door
was
opened
then
the
little
maiden
of
his
dreams
vanished
waving
her
hand
in
token
of
eternal
farewell
for
as
ruth
came
down
the
path
between
the
white
and
purple
plumes
of
lilac
with
a
smile
of
welcome
upon
her
lips
he
knew
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
nothing
half
so
fair
viii
summer
days
the
rumble
of
voices
which
came
from
the
kitchen
was
not
disturbing
but
when
the
rural
lovers
began
to
sit
on
the
piazza
directly
under
window
she
felt
called
upon
to
remonstrate
hepsey
she
asked
one
morning
why
do
you
and
joe
sit
under
the
trees
at
the
side
of
the
house
you
can
take
your
chairs
out
miss
hathaway
allerss
let
us
set
on
the
piazzer
returned
hepsey
unmoved
miss
hathaway
probably
sleeps
more
soundly
than
i
do
you
do
want
me
to
hear
everything
you
say
do
you
hepsey
shrugged
her
buxom
shoulders
you
can
if
you
like
but
i
do
like
snapped
ruth
it
annoys
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
then
hepsey
spoke
again
of
her
own
accord
if
joe
and
me
was
to
set
anywheres
but
in
front
he
might
see
the
well
what
of
it
miss
hathaway
she
do
want
it
talked
of
and
men
folks
never
can
keep
secrets
hepsey
suggested
you
would
have
to
tell
him
would
you
yes
men
folks
has
got
terrible
curious
minds
they
all
right
if
they
do
know
there
nothin
but
if
they
does
why
they
perhaps
you
right
hepsey
she
replied
biting
her
lips
sit
anywhere
you
there
were
times
when
ruth
was
compelled
to
admit
that
hepsey
mental
gifts
were
fully
equal
to
her
own
it
was
unreasonable
to
suppose
even
for
an
instant
that
joe
and
hepsey
had
not
pondered
long
and
earnestly
upon
the
subject
of
the
light
in
the
attic
window
yet
the
argument
was
unanswerable
the
matter
had
long
since
lost
its
interest
for
ruth
perhaps
because
she
was
too
happy
to
care
winfield
had
easily
acquired
the
habit
of
bringing
her
his
morning
papers
and
after
the
first
embarrassment
ruth
settled
down
to
it
in
a
businesslike
way
usually
she
sat
in
miss
hathaway
sewing
chair
under
a
tree
a
little
way
from
the
house
that
she
might
at
the
same
time
have
a
general
supervision
of
her
domain
while
winfield
stretched
himself
upon
the
grass
at
her
feet
when
the
sun
was
bright
he
wore
his
dark
glasses
thereby
gaining
an
unfair
advantage
after
breakfast
which
was
a
movable
feast
at
the
widder
he
went
after
his
mail
and
brought
hers
also
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
she
was
always
waiting
for
him
this
devotion
is
very
pleasing
he
remarked
one
morning
some
people
are
easily
pleased
she
retorted
i
dislike
to
spoil
your
pleasure
but
my
stern
regard
for
facts
compels
me
to
say
that
it
is
not
winfield
i
wait
for
but
the
then
i
always
be
your
postman
for
i
admire
to
be
waited
for
as
they
have
it
at
the
of
course
it
more
or
less
of
an
expense
this
morning
for
instance
i
had
to
dig
up
two
cents
to
get
one
of
your
valuable
manuscripts
out
of
the
clutches
of
an
interested
that
nothing
she
assured
him
for
i
save
you
a
quarter
every
day
by
taking
joe
place
as
reader
to
your
highness
not
to
mention
the
high
tariff
on
the
sunday
papers
besides
the
manuscripts
are
all
in
i
glad
to
hear
that
he
replied
sitting
down
on
the
piazza
do
you
know
miss
thorne
i
think
there
a
great
deal
of
joyous
excitement
attached
to
the
pursuit
of
literature
you
send
out
a
story
fondly
believing
that
it
is
destined
to
make
you
famous
time
goes
on
and
you
hear
nothing
from
it
you
can
see
your
name
on
the
advertisements
of
the
magazine
and
hear
the
heavy
tread
of
the
fevered
mob
on
the
way
to
buy
up
the
edition
in
the
roseate
glow
of
your
fancy
you
can
see
not
only
your
cheque
but
the
things
you
going
to
buy
with
it
perhaps
you
tell
your
friends
cautiously
that
writing
for
such
and
such
a
magazine
before
your
joy
evaporates
the
thing
comes
back
from
the
dead
letter
office
because
you
had
put
on
enough
postage
and
they
would
take
it
in
or
perhaps
written
on
the
front
page
in
blue
pencil
and
all
over
it
are
little
dark
prints
where
the
office
pup
has
walked
on
you
seem
to
be
speaking
from
you
have
guessed
it
fair
lady
with
your
usual
wonderful
insight
now
let
read
the
paper
do
you
know
you
read
much
better
than
joe
does
really
ruth
was
inclined
to
be
sarcastic
but
there
was
a
delicate
colour
in
her
cheeks
which
pleased
his
aesthetic
sense
at
first
he
had
had
an
insatiable
thirst
for
everything
in
the
paper
except
the
advertisements
the
market
reports
were
sacrificed
inside
of
a
week
and
the
obituary
notices
weather
indications
and
foreign
despatches
soon
followed
later
the
literary
features
were
eliminated
but
the
financial
and
local
news
died
hard
by
the
end
of
june
however
he
was
satisfied
with
the
headlines
no
thank
you
i
do
want
to
hear
about
the
murder
he
said
in
answer
to
ruth
ironical
question
nor
yet
the
summer
styles
in
sleeves
all
that
slop
on
the
woman
page
about
making
home
happy
is
not
suited
to
such
as
i
and
i
there
a
great
deal
here
that
very
interesting
returned
ruth
and
i
doubt
if
i
myself
could
have
crammed
more
solid
knowledge
into
one
woman
page
here
a
full
account
of
a
wealthy
lady
summer
home
and
a
description
of
a
poor
woman
garden
and
eight
recipes
and
half
a
column
on
how
to
keep
a
husband
at
home
nights
and
plans
for
making
a
china
closet
out
of
an
old
if
there
anything
that
makes
me
dead
tired
remarked
winfield
that
homemade
furniture
for
once
we
agree
answered
ruth
i
read
about
it
till
completely
out
of
patience
shirtwaist
boxes
from
soap
boxes
dressing
tables
from
packing
boxes
couches
from
cots
hall
lamps
from
old
arc
light
globes
and
clothes
hampers
from
barrels
all
these
i
endured
but
the
last
straw
was
a
kitchen
tell
me
about
it
begged
winfield
who
was
enjoying
himself
hugely
the
stove
was
to
be
set
into
the
wall
began
ruth
and
surrounded
with
marble
and
white
tiling
or
if
this
was
too
expensive
it
was
to
be
hidden
from
view
by
a
screen
of
japanese
silk
a
nice
oak
settle
hand
carved
which
young
husband
might
make
in
his
spare
moments
was
to
be
placed
in
front
of
it
and
there
were
to
be
plate
racks
and
shelves
on
the
walls
to
hold
the
rare
china
charming
kitchen
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
you
an
awfully
funny
girl
said
winfield
quietly
to
fly
into
a
passion
over
a
kitchen
that
you
never
saw
why
do
you
save
your
temper
for
real
things
she
looked
at
him
meaningly
and
he
retreated
in
good
order
i
think
i
a
tactful
person
he
continued
hurriedly
because
i
get
on
so
well
with
you
most
of
the
time
we
as
contented
as
two
kittens
in
a
my
dear
winfield
returned
ruth
pleasantly
you
not
only
tactful
but
modest
i
never
met
a
man
whose
temperament
so
nearly
approached
the
unassuming
violet
i
afraid
you
never
be
appreciated
in
this
world
you
too
good
for
it
you
must
learn
to
put
yourself
forward
i
expect
it
will
be
a
shock
to
your
sensitive
nature
but
got
to
be
thank
you
he
laughed
i
wish
we
were
in
town
now
and
i
begin
to
put
myself
forward
by
asking
you
out
to
dinner
and
afterward
to
the
why
do
you
take
me
out
to
dinner
here
she
asked
i
would
insult
you
by
offering
you
the
cooking
i
mean
a
real
dinner
with
striped
ice
cream
at
the
end
of
i
go
she
replied
i
ca
resist
the
blandishments
of
striped
ice
thank
you
again
that
gives
me
courage
to
speak
of
something
that
has
lain
very
near
my
heart
for
a
long
yes
said
ruth
conventionally
for
the
moment
she
was
frightened
i
been
thinking
fondly
of
your
though
i
have
been
allowed
to
see
it
yet
and
i
suppose
there
nothing
in
the
settlement
to
cook
in
it
is
there
nothing
much
we
might
have
some
stuff
sent
out
from
the
city
do
you
think
so
canned
things
yes
anything
that
would
aided
and
abetted
by
winfield
she
made
out
a
list
of
articles
which
were
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
i
attend
to
the
financial
part
of
it
he
said
pocketing
the
list
and
then
my
life
will
be
in
your
after
he
went
away
ruth
wished
she
knew
more
about
the
gentle
art
of
cooking
which
after
all
is
closely
allied
to
the
other
one
of
making
enemies
she
decided
to
dispense
with
hepsey
services
when
winfield
came
up
to
dinner
and
to
do
everything
herself
she
found
an
old
cook
book
of
aunt
jane
and
turned
over
its
pages
with
new
interest
it
was
in
manuscript
form
and
seemed
to
represent
the
culinary
knowledge
of
the
entire
neighbourhood
each
recipe
was
duly
accredited
to
its
original
author
and
there
were
many
newspaper
clippings
from
the
despised
woman
page
in
various
journals
ruth
thought
it
would
be
an
act
of
kindness
to
paste
the
loose
clippings
into
aunt
jane
book
and
she
could
look
them
over
as
she
fastened
them
in
the
work
progressed
rapidly
until
she
found
a
clipping
which
was
not
a
recipe
it
was
a
perfunctory
notice
of
the
death
of
charles
winfield
dated
almost
eighteen
years
ago
she
remembered
the
various
emotions
old
newspapers
had
given
her
when
she
first
came
to
aunt
jane
this
was
abigail
weatherby
husband
he
had
survived
her
by
a
dozen
years
i
glad
it
charles
winfield
instead
of
carl
thought
ruth
as
she
put
it
aside
and
went
on
with
her
work
pantry
come
announced
winfield
a
few
days
later
i
did
open
it
but
i
think
everything
is
there
joe
going
to
bring
it
then
you
can
come
to
dinner
sunday
answered
ruth
smiling
i
be
here
returned
winfield
promptly
what
time
do
we
dine
i
do
know
exactly
it
better
to
wait
i
think
until
hepsey
goes
out
she
always
regards
me
with
more
or
less
suspicion
and
it
makes
me
sunday
afternoon
the
faithful
joe
drove
up
to
the
gate
and
hepsey
emerged
from
her
small
back
room
like
a
butterfly
from
a
chrysalis
she
was
radiant
in
a
brilliant
blue
silk
which
was
festooned
at
irregular
intervals
with
white
silk
lace
her
hat
was
bending
beneath
its
burden
of
violets
and
red
roses
starred
here
and
there
with
some
unhappy
buttercups
which
had
survived
the
wreck
of
a
previous
millinery
triumph
her
hands
were
encased
in
white
cotton
gloves
which
did
not
fit
with
joe
assistance
she
entered
the
vehicle
and
took
her
place
proudly
on
the
back
seat
even
while
he
pleaded
for
her
to
sit
beside
him
you
know
yourself
that
i
ca
drive
nothin
from
the
back
seat
he
complained
nobody
askin
you
to
drive
nothin
from
nowhere
returned
hepsey
scornfully
if
you
ca
take
me
out
like
a
lady
i
ai
ruth
was
dazzled
by
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
and
was
unable
to
take
her
eyes
away
from
it
even
after
joe
had
turned
around
and
started
down
hill
she
thought
winfield
would
see
them
pass
his
door
and
time
his
arrival
accordingly
so
she
was
startled
when
he
came
up
behind
her
and
said
cheerfully
they
look
like
a
policeman
do
they
what
who
hepsey
hands
did
you
think
i
meant
yours
how
long
have
you
been
here
nearly
thirty
that
was
what
i
meant
said
ruth
colouring
how
long
have
you
been
at
aunt
jane
oh
that
different
when
joe
went
out
to
harness
his
fiery
steeds
to
his
imposing
chariot
i
went
around
through
the
woods
across
the
beach
climbed
a
vertical
precipice
and
came
up
this
side
of
the
hill
i
had
to
wait
some
little
time
but
i
had
a
front
seat
during
the
he
brought
out
her
favourite
chair
placing
it
under
the
maple
tree
then
sat
down
near
her
i
should
think
you
get
some
clothes
like
hepsey
he
began
i
wager
now
that
you
have
a
gown
like
that
in
your
entire
you
right
i
have
the
nearest
approach
to
it
is
a
tailored
gown
lined
with
silk
which
hepsey
thinks
i
should
wear
wrong
side
how
long
will
the
coast
be
clear
until
nine
i
think
they
go
to
church
in
the
it
half
past
three
now
he
observed
glancing
at
his
watch
i
had
fried
salt
pork
fried
eggs
and
fried
potatoes
for
breakfast
renounced
coffee
for
i
ca
seem
to
get
used
to
theirs
for
dinner
we
had
round
steak
fried
more
fried
potatoes
and
boiled
onions
dried
apple
pie
for
dessert
i
think
i
rather
have
had
the
mince
i
refused
this
i
feed
you
at
five
she
said
smiling
that
seems
like
a
long
time
he
complained
it
wo
after
you
begin
to
entertain
it
was
after
five
before
either
realised
it
come
on
she
said
you
can
sit
in
the
kitchen
and
watch
he
professed
great
admiration
while
she
put
on
one
of
hepsey
white
aprons
and
when
she
appeared
with
the
his
emotion
was
beyond
speech
he
was
allowed
to
open
the
box
and
to
cut
up
some
button
mushrooms
while
she
shredded
cold
chicken
i
getting
hungry
every
minute
he
said
and
if
there
is
undue
postponement
i
fear
i
shall
assimilate
all
the
raw
material
in
sight
including
the
ruth
laughed
happily
she
was
making
a
sauce
with
real
cream
seasoned
delicately
with
paprika
and
celery
salt
now
i
put
in
the
chicken
and
mushrooms
she
said
and
you
can
stir
it
while
i
make
they
were
seated
at
the
table
in
the
and
the
fun
was
at
its
height
when
they
became
aware
of
a
presence
hepsey
stood
in
the
door
apparently
transfixed
with
surprise
and
with
disapproval
evident
in
every
line
of
her
face
before
either
could
speak
she
was
gone
though
ruth
was
very
much
annoyed
the
incident
seemingly
served
to
accentuate
winfield
enjoyment
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
outside
told
them
that
she
was
continuing
her
excursion
i
going
to
discharge
her
ruth
said
you
ca
she
is
in
miss
hathaway
service
not
yours
besides
what
has
she
done
she
came
back
probably
after
something
she
had
forgotten
you
have
no
reasonable
ground
for
discharging
her
and
i
think
you
be
more
uncomfortable
if
she
went
than
if
she
perhaps
you
right
she
admitted
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
he
went
on
but
i
hope
you
wo
let
her
distress
you
it
does
make
a
bit
of
difference
to
me
she
only
amusing
please
do
bother
about
i
wo
said
ruth
that
is
i
try
not
they
piled
the
dishes
in
the
sink
as
a
pleasant
surprise
for
hepsey
he
said
and
the
hours
passed
as
if
on
wings
it
was
almost
ten
before
it
occurred
to
winfield
that
his
permanent
abode
was
not
miss
hathaway
parlour
as
they
stood
at
the
door
talking
the
last
train
came
in
do
you
know
said
winfield
that
every
night
just
as
that
train
comes
in
your
friend
down
there
puts
a
candle
in
her
front
window
well
rejoined
ruth
sharply
what
of
it
it
a
free
country
it
very
untrammelled
press
and
highly
independent
women
good
night
miss
thorne
i
be
up
the
first
thing
in
the
she
was
about
to
speak
but
slammed
the
door
instead
and
was
displeased
when
she
heard
a
smothered
laugh
from
outside
ix
by
humble
means
as
lightly
as
a
rose
petal
upon
the
shimmering
surface
of
a
stream
summer
was
drifting
away
but
whither
no
one
seemed
to
care
the
odour
of
printer
ink
upon
the
morning
paper
no
longer
aroused
vain
longings
in
winfield
breast
and
ruth
had
all
but
forgotten
her
former
connection
with
the
newspaper
world
by
degrees
winfield
had
arranged
a
routine
which
seemed
admirable
until
luncheon
time
he
was
with
ruth
and
usually
out
of
doors
according
to
prescription
in
the
afternoon
he
went
up
again
sometimes
staying
to
dinner
and
always
he
spent
his
evenings
there
why
do
you
ask
me
to
have
my
trunk
sent
up
here
he
asked
ruth
one
day
i
had
thought
of
it
she
laughed
i
suppose
it
has
seemed
miss
hathaway
would
be
pleased
would
she
if
she
knew
she
had
two
guests
instead
of
one
undoubtedly
how
could
she
help
it
when
do
you
expect
her
to
return
i
do
know
i
have
heard
a
word
from
her
sometimes
i
feel
a
little
anxious
about
ruth
would
have
been
much
concerned
for
her
relative
safety
had
she
known
that
the
eccentric
lady
had
severed
herself
from
the
excursion
and
gone
boldly
into
italy
unattended
and
with
no
knowledge
of
the
language
hepsey
inquired
daily
for
news
of
miss
hathaway
but
no
tidings
were
forthcoming
she
amused
herself
in
her
leisure
moments
by
picturing
all
sorts
of
disasters
in
which
her
mistress
was
doubtless
engulfed
and
in
speculating
upon
the
tie
between
miss
thorne
and
winfield
more
often
than
not
it
fell
to
hepsey
to
light
the
lamp
in
the
attic
window
though
she
did
it
at
miss
thorne
direction
if
i
forget
it
hepsey
she
had
said
calmly
you
see
to
it
wo
you
trunks
cedar
chests
old
newspapers
and
long
hidden
letters
were
out
of
ruth
province
now
once
in
two
or
three
weeks
she
went
to
see
miss
ainslie
but
never
stayed
long
though
almost
every
day
she
reproached
herself
for
neglect
winfield
days
were
filled
with
peace
since
he
had
learned
how
to
get
on
with
miss
thorne
when
she
showed
herself
stubborn
and
unyielding
he
retreated
gracefully
and
with
a
suggestion
of
amusement
as
a
courtier
may
step
aside
gallantly
for
an
angry
lady
to
pass
ruth
felt
his
mental
attitude
and
even
though
she
resented
it
she
was
ashamed
having
found
that
she
could
have
her
own
way
she
became
less
anxious
for
it
and
several
times
made
small
concessions
which
were
apparently
unconscious
but
amusing
nevertheless
she
had
none
of
the
wiles
of
the
coquette
she
was
transparent
and
her
friendliness
was
disarming
if
she
wanted
winfield
to
stay
at
home
any
particular
morning
or
afternoon
she
told
him
so
at
first
he
was
offended
but
afterward
learned
to
like
it
for
she
could
easily
have
instructed
hepsey
to
say
that
she
was
out
the
pitiless
unsympathetic
calendar
recorded
the
fact
that
july
was
near
its
end
and
ruth
sighed
then
hated
herself
for
it
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
idleness
and
under
the
circumstances
liked
it
far
too
well
one
morning
when
she
went
down
to
breakfast
hepsey
was
evidently
perplexed
about
something
but
ruth
took
no
outward
note
of
it
knowing
that
it
would
be
revealed
ere
long
miss
thorne
she
said
tentatively
as
ruth
rose
from
the
table
yes
of
course
miss
thorne
i
reckon
ai
none
of
my
business
but
is
winfield
another
detective
and
have
you
found
anything
out
yet
ruth
inwardly
raging
forced
herself
to
let
the
speech
pass
unnoticed
and
sailed
majestically
out
of
the
room
she
was
surprised
to
discover
that
she
could
be
made
so
furiously
angry
by
so
small
a
thing
winfield
was
coming
up
the
hill
with
the
mail
and
she
tried
to
cool
her
hot
cheeks
with
her
hands
let
go
down
on
the
side
of
the
hill
she
said
as
he
gave
her
some
letters
and
the
paper
it
very
warm
in
the
sun
and
i
like
the
sea
they
found
a
comparatively
level
place
with
two
trees
to
lean
against
and
though
they
were
not
far
from
the
house
they
were
effectually
screened
by
the
rising
ground
ruth
felt
that
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
hepsey
just
then
after
glancing
at
her
letters
she
began
to
read
aloud
with
a
troubled
haste
which
did
not
escape
him
here
a
man
who
had
a
little
piece
of
bone
taken
out
of
the
inside
of
his
skull
she
said
shall
i
read
about
that
he
seems
literally
to
have
had
something
on
his
you
brilliant
this
morning
answered
winfield
gravely
and
she
laughed
hysterically
what
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
you
do
seem
like
it
is
nice
of
you
to
say
that
she
retorted
considering
your
previous
there
was
a
rumble
and
a
snort
on
the
road
and
welcoming
the
diversion
he
went
up
to
reconnoitre
joe
coming
is
there
anything
you
want
in
the
village
no
she
answered
wearily
there
nothing
i
want
you
an
exceptional
woman
returned
winfield
promptly
and
i
advise
you
to
sit
for
your
photograph
the
papers
would
like
it
of
the
only
woman
who
does
want
anything
why
that
would
work
off
an
extra
in
about
ten
minutes
ruth
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
turned
her
eyes
away
he
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
and
was
about
to
offer
atonement
when
joe
deep
bass
voice
called
out
hello
hello
yourself
came
in
hepsey
highest
tones
from
the
garden
want
anything
nope
there
was
a
brief
pause
and
then
joe
shouted
again
hepsey
well
i
should
think
they
break
their
vocal
cords
said
winfield
i
wish
they
would
rejoined
ruth
quickly
come
here
yelled
joe
i
want
to
talk
to
talk
from
there
screamed
hepsey
where
yer
folks
say
be
they
courtin
hepsey
left
her
work
in
the
garden
and
came
toward
the
front
of
the
house
they
walk
out
some
she
said
when
she
was
halfway
to
the
gate
and
they
set
up
a
good
deal
and
miss
thorne
told
me
she
did
know
as
she
do
better
but
you
ca
rightly
say
they
courtin
city
ways
ai
like
the
deep
colour
dyed
ruth
face
and
her
hands
twitched
nervously
winfield
very
much
desired
to
talk
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
the
situation
was
tense
joe
clucked
to
his
horses
so
long
he
said
see
yer
ruth
held
her
breath
until
he
passed
them
and
then
broke
down
her
self
control
was
quite
gone
and
she
sobbed
bitterly
in
grief
and
shame
winfield
tucked
his
handkerchief
into
her
cold
hands
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
do
he
said
as
if
he
too
had
been
hurt
ruth
dear
do
cry
a
new
tenderness
almost
unmanned
him
but
he
sat
still
with
his
hands
clenched
feeling
like
a
brute
because
of
her
tears
the
next
few
minutes
seemed
like
an
hour
then
ruth
raised
her
head
and
tried
to
smile
i
expect
you
think
i
silly
she
said
hiding
her
tear
stained
face
again
no
he
cried
sharply
then
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
do
she
sobbed
turning
away
from
him
what
what
they
said
was
bad
enough
the
last
words
ended
in
a
rush
of
tears
and
sorely
distressed
he
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
then
a
bright
idea
came
to
him
i
be
back
in
a
minute
he
said
when
he
returned
he
had
a
tin
dipper
freshly
filled
with
cold
water
do
cry
any
more
he
pleaded
gently
i
going
to
bathe
your
ruth
leaned
back
against
the
tree
and
he
knelt
beside
her
oh
that
feels
so
good
she
said
gratefully
as
she
felt
his
cool
fingers
upon
her
burning
eyes
in
a
little
while
she
was
calm
again
though
her
breast
still
heaved
with
every
fluttering
breath
you
poor
little
woman
he
said
tenderly
you
just
as
nervous
as
you
can
be
do
feel
so
about
it
just
suppose
it
was
somebody
who
was
who
was
what
asked
ruth
innocently
winfield
crimsoned
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
hurled
the
dipper
into
the
distance
what
what
they
said
he
stammered
sitting
down
awkwardly
oh
darn
it
he
kicked
savagely
at
a
root
and
added
in
bitterest
self
accusation
i
a
chump
i
am
no
you
not
returned
ruth
with
sweet
shyness
you
nice
now
we
read
some
more
of
the
he
assumed
a
feverish
interest
in
the
market
reports
but
his
thoughts
were
wandering
certainly
nothing
could
have
been
worse
he
felt
as
if
a
bud
which
he
had
been
long
and
eagerly
watching
was
suddenly
torn
open
by
a
vandal
hand
when
he
first
touched
ruth
eyes
with
his
finger
tips
he
had
trembled
like
a
schoolboy
and
he
wondered
if
she
knew
it
if
she
did
she
made
no
sign
her
cheeks
were
flushed
the
lids
of
her
downcast
eyes
were
pink
and
her
voice
had
lost
its
crisp
incisive
tones
but
she
read
rapidly
without
comment
or
pause
until
the
supply
of
news
gave
out
then
she
began
on
the
advertisements
dreading
the
end
of
her
task
and
vainly
wishing
for
more
papers
though
in
her
heart
there
was
something
sweet
which
even
to
herself
she
dared
not
name
that
do
he
said
abruptly
i
not
interested
in
the
glove
clearing
i
meant
to
tell
you
something
when
i
first
came
got
to
go
ruth
heart
throbbed
painfully
as
if
some
cold
hand
held
it
fast
yes
she
said
politely
not
recognising
her
own
voice
it
only
for
a
week
i
got
to
go
to
the
oculist
and
see
about
some
other
things
i
be
back
before
i
shall
miss
you
she
said
conventionally
then
she
saw
that
he
was
going
away
to
relieve
her
from
the
embarrassment
of
his
presence
and
blessed
him
accordingly
when
are
you
going
she
asked
this
afternoon
i
do
want
to
go
but
it
just
as
well
to
have
it
over
with
can
i
do
anything
for
you
in
the
city
no
thank
you
my
wants
are
few
and
at
present
well
do
you
want
me
to
match
something
for
you
i
thought
women
always
had
pieces
of
stuff
that
had
to
be
matched
they
made
you
edit
the
funny
column
did
they
she
asked
irrelevantly
they
did
miss
thorne
and
moreover
i
expect
i
have
to
do
it
after
a
little
they
were
back
on
the
old
footing
yet
everything
was
different
for
there
was
an
obtruding
self
consciousness
on
either
side
what
time
do
you
go
she
asked
with
assumed
indifference
i
think
and
it
after
one
he
walked
back
to
the
house
with
her
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
hepsey
came
out
to
sweep
the
piazza
good
bye
miss
thorne
he
said
good
bye
that
was
all
but
ruth
looked
up
with
an
unspoken
question
and
his
eyes
met
hers
clearly
with
no
turning
aside
she
knew
he
would
come
back
very
soon
and
she
understood
his
answer
that
he
had
the
right
as
she
entered
the
house
hepsey
said
pleasantly
has
he
gone
away
miss
thorne
yes
she
answered
without
emotion
she
was
about
to
say
that
she
did
not
care
for
luncheon
then
decided
that
she
must
seem
to
care
still
it
was
impossible
to
escape
that
observer
you
eatin
much
she
suggested
i
not
very
be
you
sick
miss
thorne
no
not
exactly
i
been
out
in
the
sun
and
my
head
aches
she
replied
clutching
at
the
straw
do
you
want
a
wet
rag
ruth
laughed
remembering
an
earlier
suggestion
of
winfield
no
i
do
want
any
wet
rag
hepsey
but
i
go
up
to
my
room
for
a
little
while
i
think
please
do
disturb
she
locked
her
door
shutting
out
all
the
world
from
the
nameless
joy
that
surged
in
her
heart
the
mirror
disclosed
flushed
feverish
cheeks
and
dark
eyes
that
shone
like
stars
ruth
thorne
she
said
to
herself
i
ashamed
of
you
first
you
act
like
a
fool
and
then
like
a
girl
of
sixteen
then
her
senses
became
confused
and
the
objects
in
the
room
circled
around
her
unsteadily
i
tired
she
murmured
her
head
sank
drowsily
into
the
lavender
scented
pillow
and
she
slept
too
soundly
to
take
note
of
the
three
train
leaving
the
station
it
was
almost
sunset
when
she
was
aroused
by
voices
under
her
window
that
feller
gone
home
said
joe
do
tell
exclaimed
hepsey
did
he
pay
his
board
yep
every
cent
he
when
do
she
know
the
emphasis
indicated
miss
thorne
i
guess
not
answered
hepsey
they
said
good
bye
right
in
front
of
me
and
there
nothin
said
about
they
ai
courtin
then
said
joe
after
a
few
moments
of
painful
thought
and
ruth
in
her
chamber
above
laughed
happily
to
herself
mebbe
not
rejoined
hepsey
it
ai
fer
sech
as
me
to
say
when
there
courtin
and
when
there
ai
after
havin
gone
well
nigh
onto
five
year
with
a
country
loafer
what
ai
never
said
she
stalked
into
the
house
closed
the
door
and
noisily
bolted
it
joe
stood
there
for
a
moment
as
one
struck
dumb
then
gave
a
long
low
whistle
of
astonishment
and
walked
slowly
down
the
hill
x
love
letters
a
week
ruth
said
to
herself
the
next
morning
seven
long
days
no
letter
because
he
must
write
no
telegram
because
there
no
office
within
ten
miles
nothing
to
do
but
wait
when
she
went
down
to
breakfast
hepsey
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
cheery
greeting
but
was
twisting
her
apron
and
walking
about
restlessly
miss
thorne
she
said
at
length
did
you
ever
get
a
love
letter
why
yes
of
course
laughed
ruth
every
girl
gets
love
hepsey
brightened
visibly
then
inquired
with
great
seriousness
can
you

miss
thorne
that
depends
on
the
yes
it
does
so
i
can
read
some

you
find
this
morning
it
too
early
for
the
mail
is
it
yes
it
was
stuck
under
the
kitchen
hepsey
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
in
an
effort
to
appear
careless
and
sighed
then
she
clutched
violently
at
the
front
of
her
blue
gingham
dress
immediately
repenting
of
her
rashness
ruth
was
inwardly
amused
but
asked
no
helpful
questions
finally
hepsey
took
the
plunge
would
you
mind
tryin
to
make
out
some
writin
i
got
miss
thorne
of
course
not
let
me
see
hepsey
extracted
a
letter
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
attire
and
stood
expectantly
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
why
it
a
love
letter
ruth
exclaimed
yes
when
you
get
through
readin
it
to
yourself
will
you
read
it
out
loud
the
letter
which
was
written
on
ruled
note
paper
bore
every
evidence
of
care
and
thought
hepsey
it
began
and
on
the
line
below
with
a
great
flourish
under
it
respected
miss
stood
in
large
capitals
although
it
is
now
but
a
short
interval
ruth
read
since
my
delighted
eyes
first
rested
on
your
beautiful
form
five
year
interjected
hepsey
yet
i
dare
to
hope
that
you
will
receive
graciously
what
i
am
about
to
say
as
i
am
assured
you
will
if
you
reciprocate
the
sentiments
which
you
have
aroused
in
my
bosom
in
this
short
time
dear
miss
brief
though
it
is
yet
it
has
proved
amply
sufficient
for
my
heart
to
go
out
to
you
in
a
yearning
love
which
i
have
never
before
felt
for
one
of
your
sex
day
by
day
and
night
by
night
your
glorious
image
has
followed
that
a
lie
interrupted
hepsey
he
knows
i
never
chased
him
nowheres
not
even
when
he
took
that
smith
girl
to
the
picnic
over
to
the
ridge
a
year
ago
come
those
dark
tresses
have
entwined
my
soul
in
their
silken
meshes
those
deep
eyes
that
have
borrowed
their
colour
from
heaven
cerulean
blue
and
those
soft
white
hands
that
have
never
been
roughened
by
uncongenial
toil
have
been
ever
present
in
my
ruth
paused
for
a
moment
overcome
by
her
task
but
hepsey
face
was
radiant
hurry
up
miss
thorne
she
said
impatiently
in
short
dear
miss
i
consider
you
the
most
surpassingly
lovely
of
your
kind
and
it
is
with
pride
swelling
in
my
manly
bosom
that
i
dare
to
ask
so
peerless
a
jewel
for
her
heart
and
hand
my
parentage
birth
and
breeding
are
probably
known
to
you
but
should
any
points
remain
doubtful
i
will
be
pleased
to
present
references
as
to
my
character
and
standing
in
the
community
i
await
with
impatience
madam
your
favourable
answer
to
my
plea
rest
assured
that
if
you
should
so
honour
me
as
to
accept
my
proposal
i
will
endeavour
to
stand
always
between
you
and
the
hard
cruel
world
as
your
faithful
shield
i
will
also
endeavour
constantly
to
give
you
a
happiness
as
great
as
that
which
will
immediately
flood
my
bing
upon
receipt
of
your
blushing
acceptance
i
remain
dear
miss
your
devoted
lover
and
humble
servant
joseph
pendleton
my
my
ejaculated
hepsey
ai
that
fine
writin
it
certainly
is
responded
miss
thorne
keeping
her
face
straight
with
difficulty
would
you
mind
readin
it
again
she
found
the
second
recital
much
easier
since
she
was
partially
accustomed
to
the
heavy
punctuation
marks
and
shaded
flourishes
at
first
she
had
connected
winfield
with
the
effusion
but
second
thought
placed
the
blame
where
it
belonged
at
the
door
of
a
complete
letter
miss
thorne
said
hepsey
hesitating
yes
of
course
i
like
my
answer
to
be
as
good
writin
as
where
he
got
all
that
lovely
grammar
grammar
is
a
rare
gift
yes
is
so
miss
thorne
do
you
guess
you
could
write
as
good
as
that
i
be
willing
to
try
returned
ruth
with
due
humility
hepsey
thought
painfully
for
a
few
moments
i
know
jest
what
better
say
now
last
night
i
give
joe
a
hint
as
you
may
say
but
i
would
want
him
to
think
i
jest
been
for
no
of
course
ai
it
better
to
keep
him
in
suspense
as
you
may
say
far
better
hepsey
he
think
more
of
then
i
jest
write
that
i
willin
to
think
it
over
and
if
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
fer
me
i
write
it
out
with
ink
i
got
two
sheets
of
paper
jest
like
this
with
nice
blue
lines
onto
it
that
i
been
fer
a
letter
and
miss
hathaway
she
got
ruth
sat
down
to
compose
an
answer
which
should
cast
a
shadow
over
the
complete
letter
her
pencil
flew
over
the
rough
copy
paper
with
lightning
speed
while
hepsey
stood
by
in
amazement
listen
she
said
at
length
how
do
you
like
this
mr
joseph
pendleton
respected
sir
although
your
communication
of
recent
date
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
candour
compels
me
to
confess
that
it
was
not
entirely
disagreeable
i
have
observed
though
with
true
feminine
delicacy
that
your
affections
were
inclined
to
settle
in
my
direction
and
have
not
repelled
your
advances
still
i
do
not
feel
that
as
yet
we
are
sufficiently
acquainted
to
render
immediate
matrimony
either
wise
or
desirable
and
since
the
suddenness
of
your
proposal
has
in
a
measure
taken
my
breath
away
i
must
beg
that
you
will
allow
me
a
proper
interval
in
which
to
consider
the
matter
and
in
the
meantime
think
of
me
simply
as
your
dearest
friend
i
may
add
in
conclusion
that
your
character
and
standing
in
the
community
are
entirely
satisfactory
to
me
thanking
you
for
the
honour
you
have
conferred
upon
me
believe
me
dear
sir
your
sincere
friend
my
exclaimed
hepsey
with
overmastering
pride
ai
that
beautiful
it
better
than
ai
it
i
would
say
that
ruth
replied
with
proper
modesty
but
i
think
it
will
yes
so
your
writin
ai
nothin
like
joe
she
continued
scanning
it
closely
but
it
real
then
a
bright
idea
illuminated
her
countenance
miss
thorne
if
you
write
it
out
on
the
note
paper
with
a
pencil
i
can
go
over
it
with
the
ink
and
afterward
when
it
dry
i
rub
out
the
pencil
it
be
my
then
but
it
look
jest
like
all
right
she
found
it
difficult
to
follow
the
lines
closely
but
at
length
achieved
a
respectable
result
i
take
good
care
of
it
hepsey
said
wrapping
the
precious
missive
in
a
newspaper
and
this
afternoon
when
i
get
my
work
done
up
i
fix
it
joe
be
surprised
wo
he
late
in
the
evening
when
hepsey
came
to
ruth
worn
with
the
unaccustomed
labours
of
correspondence
and
proudly
displayed
the
nondescript
epistle
she
was
compelled
to
admit
that
unless
joe
had
superhuman
qualities
he
would
indeed
be
the
next
afternoon
ruth
went
down
to
miss
ainslie
you
been
neglecting
me
dear
said
that
gentle
soul
as
she
opened
the
door
i
have
meant
to
returned
ruth
as
she
remembered
how
long
it
had
been
since
the
gate
of
the
garden
had
swung
on
its
hinges
for
her
a
quiet
happiness
had
settled
down
upon
ruth
and
the
old
perturbed
spirit
was
gone
but
miss
ainslie
was
subtly
different
i
feel
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
she
said
something
nice
i
do
the
sweet
face
was
troubled
and
there
were
fine
lines
about
the
mouth
such
as
ruth
had
never
seen
there
before
you
nervous
miss
ainslie
it
my
turn
to
scold
i
never
scolded
you
did
i
deary
you
could
scold
anybody
you
too
sweet
you
not
unhappy
are
you
miss
ainslie
i
why
no
why
should
i
be
unhappy
her
deep
eyes
were
fixed
upon
ruth
i
i
did
know
ruth
answered
in
confusion
i
learned
long
ago
said
miss
ainslie
after
a
little
that
we
may
be
happy
or
not
just
as
we
choose
happiness
is
not
a
circumstance
nor
a
set
of
circumstances
it
only
a
light
and
we
may
keep
it
burning
if
we
will
so
many
of
us
are
like
children
crying
for
the
moon
instead
of
playing
contentedly
with
the
few
toys
we
have
we
always
hoping
for
something
and
when
it
does
come
we
fret
and
worry
when
it
does
why
there
always
something
else
we
rather
have
we
deliberately
make
nearly
all
of
our
unhappiness
with
our
own
unreasonable
discontent
and
nothing
will
ever
make
us
happy
deary
except
the
spirit
but
miss
ainslie
ruth
objected
do
you
really
think
everybody
can
be
happy
of
course
everybody
who
wishes
to
be
some
people
are
happier
when
they
miserable
i
do
mean
deary
that
it
easy
for
any
of
us
and
it
harder
for
some
than
for
others
all
because
we
never
grow
up
we
always
children
our
playthings
are
a
little
different
ourselves
forever
children
quoted
ruth
pebbles
on
a
boundless
shore
yes
i
was
just
thinking
of
that
a
little
girl
breaks
her
doll
and
though
the
new
one
may
be
much
prettier
it
never
wholly
fills
the
vacant
place
and
it
that
way
with
a
woman
the
sweet
voice
sank
into
a
whisper
followed
by
a
lingering
sigh
miss
ainslie
said
ruth
after
a
pause
did
you
know
my
mother
no
i
did
deary
i
sorry
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
but
she
went
away
soon
after
we
came
never
mind
ruth
said
hurriedly
for
thorne
family
had
never
forgiven
her
runaway
marriage
come
into
the
garden
miss
ainslie
suggested
and
ruth
followed
her
willingly
into
the
cloistered
spot
where
golden
lilies
tinkled
thrushes
sang
and
every
leaf
breathed
peace
miss
ainslie
gathered
a
bit
of
rosemary
crushing
it
between
her
white
fingers
see
she
said
some
of
us
are
like
that
it
takes
a
blow
to
find
the
sweetness
in
our
souls
some
of
us
need
dry
hard
places
like
the
poppies
pointing
to
a
mass
of
brilliant
bloom
and
some
of
us
are
always
thorny
like
the
cactus
with
only
once
in
a
while
a
rosy
star
i
always
thought
my
flowers
had
souls
dear
she
went
on
they
seem
like
real
people
to
me
i
seen
the
roses
rubbing
their
cheeks
together
as
if
they
loved
each
other
and
the
are
little
children
half
afraid
of
the
rest
over
there
it
always
seems
to
me
as
if
the
lavender
was
a
little
woman
in
a
green
dress
with
a
lavender
bonnet
and
a
white
kerchief
she
one
of
those
strong
sweet
wholesome
people
who
always
rest
you
and
her
sweetness
lingers
long
after
she
goes
away
i
gather
all
the
flowers
and
every
leaf
though
the
flowers
are
sweetest
i
put
the
leaves
away
with
my
linen
and
the
flowers
among
my
laces
i
have
some
beautiful
lace
i
know
you
have
i
often
admired
i
going
to
show
it
to
you
some
day
she
said
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
and
some
other
day
when
i
ca
wear
it
any
more
you
shall
have
some
of
it
for
your
do
miss
ainslie
cried
ruth
the
quick
tears
coming
to
her
eyes
i
do
want
any
lace
i
want
you
i
know
she
answered
but
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
and
something
in
her
voice
that
sounded
like
a
farewell
miss
thorne
called
joe
from
the
gate
here
a
package
for
yer
it
come
on
the
he
waited
until
ruth
went
to
him
and
seemed
disappointed
when
she
turned
back
into
the
garden
say
he
shouted
is
hepsey
to
home
ruth
was
busy
with
the
string
and
did
not
hear
oh
look
she
exclaimed
what
roses
they
beautiful
deary
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
seen
such
large
ones
do
you
know
what
they
are
american
beauties
they
from
winfield
he
knows
i
love
miss
ainslie
started
violently
from
whom
dear
she
asked
in
a
strange
tone
mr
winfield
he
going
to
be
on
the
same
paper
with
me
in
the
fall
he
here
for
the
summer
on
account
of
his
miss
ainslie
was
bending
over
the
lavender
it
is
a
very
common
name
is
it
not
she
asked
yes
quite
common
answered
ruth
absently
taking
the
roses
out
of
the
box
you
must
bring
him
to
see
me
some
time
dear
i
should
like
to
know
thank
you
miss
ainslie
i
they
stood
at
the
gate
together
and
ruth
put
a
half
blown
rose
into
her
hand
i
would
give
it
to
anybody
but
you
she
said
half
playfully
and
then
miss
ainslie
knew
her
secret
she
put
her
hand
on
ruth
arm
and
looked
down
into
her
face
as
if
there
was
something
she
must
say
i
do
forget
the
light
miss
i
know
she
breathed
in
answer
she
looked
long
and
searchingly
into
ruth
eyes
then
whispered
brokenly
god
bless
you
dear
good
bye
xi
the
rose
of
all
the
world
he
did
forget
me
he
did
forget
me
ruth
heart
sang
in
time
with
her
step
as
she
went
home
late
afternoon
flooded
all
the
earth
with
gold
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
came
the
gentle
music
of
the
sea
the
doors
were
open
but
there
was
no
trace
of
hepsey
she
put
the
roses
in
her
water
pitcher
and
locked
her
door
upon
them
as
one
hides
a
sacred
joy
she
went
out
again
her
heart
swelling
like
the
throat
of
a
singing
bird
and
walked
to
the
brow
of
the
cliff
with
every
sense
keenly
alive
upon
the
surface
of
the
ocean
lay
that
deep
translucent
blue
which
only
tadema
has
dared
to
paint
i
must
go
down
she
murmured
like
a
tawny
ribbon
trailed
upon
the
green
the
road
wound
down
the
hill
she
followed
it
until
she
reached
the
side
path
on
the
right
and
went
down
into
the
woods
the
great
boughs
arched
over
her
head
like
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
and
the
little
people
of
the
forest
in
feathers
and
fur
scattered
as
she
approached
bright
eyes
peeped
at
her
from
behind
tree
trunks
or
the
safe
shelter
of
branches
and
rippling
bird
music
ended
in
a
frightened
chirp
oh
she
said
aloud
do
be
afraid
was
this
love
she
wondered
that
lay
upon
her
eyes
like
the
dew
of
a
spring
morning
that
made
the
air
vocal
with
rapturous
song
and
wrought
white
magic
in
her
soul
it
had
all
the
mystery
ind
freshness
of
the
world
beginning
it
was
the
rush
of
waters
where
sea
and
river
meet
the
perfume
of
a
flower
and
the
far
light
trembling
from
a
star
it
was
sunrise
where
there
had
been
no
day
the
ecstasy
of
a
thousand
dawns
a
new
sun
gleaming
upon
noon
all
the
joy
of
the
world
surged
and
beat
in
her
pulses
till
it
seemed
that
her
heart
had
wings
sunset
came
upon
the
water
the
colour
on
the
horizon
reflecting
soft
iridescence
upon
the
blue
slow
sapphire
surges
broke
at
her
feet
tossing
great
pearls
of
spray
against
the
cliff
suddenly
as
if
by
instinct
she
turned
and
faced
winfield
thank
you
for
the
roses
she
cried
with
her
face
aglow
he
gathered
her
into
his
arms
oh
my
rose
of
all
the
world
he
murmured
have
i
found
you
at
last
it
was
almost
dusk
when
they
turned
to
go
home
with
their
arms
around
each
other
as
if
they
were
the
first
two
wandering
through
the
shaded
groves
of
paradise
before
sin
came
into
the
world
did
you
think
it
would
be
like
this
she
asked
shyly
no
i
did
darling
i
thought
it
would
be
very
prim
and
proper
i
never
dreamed
you
let
me
kiss
you
yes
i
did
too
but
i
thought
it
was
too
good
to
be
i
had
to
to
let
you
she
explained
crimsoning
but
nobody
ever
did
before
i
always
thought
then
ruth
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
in
maidenly
shame
when
they
came
to
the
log
across
the
path
they
sat
down
very
close
together
you
said
we
fight
if
we
came
here
ruth
whispered
we
not
going
to
though
i
want
to
tell
you
something
dear
and
i
have
had
the
words
for
it
till
what
is
it
she
asked
in
alarm
it
only
that
i
love
you
ruth
he
said
holding
her
closer
and
when
i
said
that
i
said
all
it
is
an
idle
word
it
all
my
life
that
i
give
you
to
do
with
as
you
will
it
is
anything
apart
from
you
or
ever
could
be
it
as
much
yours
as
your
hands
or
eyes
are
i
did
know
it
for
a
little
while
that
because
i
was
blind
to
think
that
i
should
go
up
to
see
you
even
that
first
day
without
knowing
you
for
my
sweetheart
my
wife
no
do
draw
away
from
me
you
little
wild
bird
are
you
afraid
of
love
it
the
sweetest
thing
god
ever
let
a
man
dream
of
ruth
nothing
like
it
in
all
the
world
look
up
sweet
eyes
and
say
you
love
me
ruth
head
drooped
and
he
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
turning
her
face
toward
him
but
her
eyes
were
downcast
still
say
it
darling
he
pleaded
i
i
ca
she
stammered
why
dear
because
because
you
i
want
you
to
say
it
sweetheart
wo
you
sometime
when
when
when
it
it
dark
no
it
is
how
did
you
know
how
did
i
know
what
dear
that
i
that
i
i
knew
the
day
you
cried
i
did
know
myself
until
then
but
it
all
came
in
a
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
stay
away
a
whole
i
could
darling
i
just
had
to
did
you
see
everybody
you
wanted
to
see
i
could
see
anything
but
your
face
ruth
with
the
tears
on
it
got
to
go
back
and
have
another
try
at
the
oh
she
exclaimed
in
acute
disappointment
it
the
last
time
sweetheart
we
never
be
separated
never
never
in
all
the
world
nor
i
expect
you
think
i
silly
she
said
wiping
her
eyes
as
they
rose
to
go
home
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
i
do
want
to
go
dearest
if
you
going
to
cry
you
have
me
a
raving
maniac
i
ca
stand
it
i
not
going
to
she
answered
smiling
through
her
tears
but
it
a
blessed
privilege
to
have
a
nice
stiff
collar
and
a
new
tie
to
cry
they
at
your
service
dear
for
anything
but
that
i
suppose
engaged
now
are
we
i
do
know
said
ruth
in
a
low
tone
you
have
asked
me
to
marry
do
you
want
me
to
it
time
is
it
winfield
bent
over
and
whispered
to
her
i
must
think
about
it
said
ruth
very
gravely
it
so
oh
you
sweet
girl
he
laughed
are
you
going
to
give
me
any
encouragement
you
had
i
want
another
he
answered
purposely
misunderstanding
her
and
besides
it
dark
the
twilight
still
lingered
on
the
hillside
and
a
star
or
two
gleamed
through
the
open
spaces
above
a
moment
later
ruth
in
her
turn
whispered
to
him
it
was
only
a
word
or
two
but
the
robins
who
were
peeping
at
them
from
the
maple
branches
must
have
observed
that
it
was
highly
satisfactory
xii
bride
and
groom
though
winfield
had
sternly
determined
to
go
back
to
town
the
following
day
he
did
not
achieve
departure
until
later
ruth
went
to
the
station
with
him
and
desolation
came
upon
her
when
the
train
pulled
out
in
spite
of
the
new
happiness
in
her
heart
she
had
little
time
to
miss
him
however
for
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
in
accordance
with
immemorial
custom
the
unexpected
happened
she
was
sitting
at
her
window
one
morning
trying
to
sew
when
the
village
chariot
stopped
at
the
gate
and
a
lady
descended
joe
stirred
lazily
on
the
front
seat
but
she
said
in
a
clear
voice
you
need
trouble
yourself
joe
he
carry
the
she
came
toward
the
house
fanning
herself
with
a
certain
stateliness
and
carrying
her
handkerchief
primly
by
the
exact
centre
of
it
in
her
wake
was
a
little
old
gentleman
with
a
huge
bundle
surrounded
by
a
a
large
valise
much
the
worse
for
wear
a
telescope
basket
which
was
expanded
to
its
full
height
and
two
small
parcels
a
cane
was
tucked
under
one
arm
and
an
umbrella
under
the
other
he
could
scarcely
be
seen
behind
the
mountain
of
baggage
hepsey
was
already
at
the
door
why
miss
hathaway
she
cried
in
astonishment
ai
miss
hathaway
rejoined
the
visitor
with
some
asperity
it
ball
and
this
is
my
husband
niece
ruth
i
presume
she
added
as
miss
thorne
appeared
ruth
let
me
introduce
you
to
your
uncle
the
bride
was
of
medium
height
and
rather
angular
her
eyes
were
small
dark
and
so
piercingly
brilliant
that
they
suggested
jet
beads
her
skin
was
dark
and
her
lips
had
been
habitually
compressed
into
a
straight
line
none
the
less
it
was
the
face
that
ruth
had
seen
in
the
ambrotype
at
miss
ainslie
with
the
additional
hardness
that
comes
to
those
who
grow
old
without
love
her
bearing
was
that
of
a
brisk
active
woman
accustomed
all
her
life
to
obedience
and
respect
ball
was
two
or
three
inches
shorter
than
his
wife
and
had
a
white
beard
irregularly
streaked
with
brown
he
was
baldheaded
in
front
had
scant
reddish
hair
in
the
back
and
his
faded
blue
eyes
were
tearful
he
had
very
small
feet
and
the
unmistakable
gait
of
a
sailor
though
there
was
no
immediate
resemblance
ruth
was
sure
that
he
was
the
man
whose
picture
was
in
aunt
jane
treasure
chest
in
the
attic
the
daredevil
look
was
gone
however
and
he
was
merely
a
quiet
inoffensive
old
gentleman
for
whom
life
had
been
none
too
easy
welcome
to
your
new
home
james
said
his
wife
in
a
crisp
businesslike
tone
which
but
partially
concealed
a
latent
tenderness
he
smiled
but
made
no
reply
hepsey
still
stood
in
the
parlour
in
wide
mouthed
astonishment
and
it
was
ruth
good
fortune
to
see
the
glance
which
ball
cast
upon
her
offending
maid
there
was
no
change
of
expression
except
in
the
eyes
but
hepsey
instantly
understood
that
she
was
out
of
her
place
and
retreated
to
the
kitchen
with
a
flush
upon
her
cheeks
which
was
altogether
foreign
to
ruth
experience
you
can
set
here
james
resumed
ball
until
i
have
taken
off
my
the
cherries
on
her
black
straw
bonnet
were
shaking
on
their
stems
in
a
way
which
fascinated
ruth
i
take
my
things
out
of
the
south
room
aunty
she
hastened
to
say
you
wo
neither
was
the
unexpected
answer
that
the
spare
room
and
while
you
stay
you
stay
ruth
was
wondering
what
to
say
to
her
new
uncle
and
sat
in
awkward
silence
as
aunt
jane
ascended
the
stairs
her
step
sounded
lightly
overhead
and
ball
twirled
his
thumbs
absently
you
you
come
a
long
way
have
you
she
asked
yes
a
long
then
seemingly
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
her
and
a
benevolent
expression
came
upon
his
face
you
got
awful
pretty
hair
niece
ruth
he
observed
admiringly
now
mis
ball
she
wears
a
false
the
lady
of
the
house
returned
at
this
juncture
with
the
false
front
a
little
askew
i
was
just
ball
continued
that
our
niece
is
a
real
pleasant
lookin
she
your
niece
by
marriage
his
wife
replied
but
she
ai
no
real
niece
by
merriage
is
relative
enough
said
and
i
say
she
a
pleasant
lookin
woman
ai
she
now
she
do
i
reckon
she
resembles
her
aunt
jane
looked
at
ruth
as
if
pitying
the
sister
who
had
blindly
followed
the
leadings
of
her
heart
and
had
died
unforgiven
why
did
you
let
me
know
you
were
coming
aunt
jane
asked
ruth
i
been
looking
for
a
letter
every
day
and
i
understood
you
coming
back
until
i
trust
i
am
not
unwelcome
in
my
own
house
was
the
somewhat
frigid
response
no
indeed
aunty
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
we
had
a
beautiful
time
ai
we
james
we
been
on
our
yes
we
hev
been
on
our
honeymoon
travellin
over
strange
lands
furrin
wastes
of
waters
mis
ball
was
terrible
sea
sick
comin
in
a
way
said
aunt
jane
we
ai
completely
married
we
was
married
by
a
heathen
priest
in
a
heathen
country
and
it
ai
rightfully
bindin
but
we
thought
it
would
do
until
we
could
get
back
here
and
be
married
by
a
minister
of
the
gospel
did
we
james
it
has
held
he
said
without
emotion
but
i
reckon
we
will
hev
to
be
merried
likewise
i
have
my
weddin
dress
aunt
jane
went
on
what
ai
never
been
worn
it
a
beautiful
dress
trimmed
with
pearl
trimmin
here
ruth
felt
the
pangs
of
a
guilty
conscience
and
i
lay
out
to
be
married
in
it
quite
private
with
you
and
hepsey
for
why
it
quite
a
romance
is
it
aunty
is
in
a
way
interjected
ball
and
in
another
way
yes
ruth
aunt
jane
continued
ignoring
the
interruption
is
a
romance
a
real
romance
she
repeated
with
all
the
hard
lines
in
her
face
softened
we
was
engaged
over
year
james
went
to
sea
to
make
a
fortin
so
he
could
give
me
every
luxury
it
all
writ
out
in
a
letter
i
got
upstairs
they
beautiful
letters
ruth
and
come
to
me
as
i
been
settin
here
that
you
might
make
a
book
these
letters
of
james
you
write

you
why
yes
aunty
i
write
for
the
papers
but
i
never

a
well

a
book
no
earlier
and
here
all
the
material
as
you
say
jest
for
you
to
copy
it
i
guess
over
a
hundred
but
aunty
objected
ruth
struggling
with
inward
emotion
i
sign
my
name
to
it
you
know
unless
i
had
written
the
why
not
because
it
would
be
honest
she
answered
clutching
at
the
straw
the
person
who
wrote
the
letters
would
be
entitled
to
the
credit
and
the
money
she
added
hopefully
why
yes
that
right
do
you
hear
james
it
have
to
be
your
book
love
letters
of
a
sailor
by
james

how

borrered
a
chisel

the
ridge
and

and
they

ai
i
replied
ball
seeming
to
detect
a
covert
reproach
i
was
allers
a
great
hand
fer
there
have
to
be
a
piece
writ
in
the
end
ruth
explainin
the
happy
endin
of
the
romance
if
you
ca
do
it
justice
james
and
me
can
help
james
was
allers
a
master
hand
at
writin
it
have
to
tell
how
through
the
long
years
he
has
toiled
hopin
against
hope
and
for
over
thirty
years
not
darin
to
write
a
line
to
the
object
of
his
affections
not
feelin
worthy
as
you
may
say
and
how
after
her
waitin
faithfully
at
home
and
turnin
away
dozens
of
lovers
what
pleaded
she
finally
went
travellin
in
furrin
parts
and
come
upon
her
old
lover
a
store
in
a
heathen
land
to
retrieve
disaster
after
disaster
at
sea
and
constantly
withstandin
the
blandishments
of
heathen
women
as
endeavoured
to
wean
him
from
his
faith
and
how
though
very
humble
and
scarcely
darin
to
speak
he
learned
that
she
was
and
they
come
a
sailin
home
together
and
lived
happily
ever
afterward
ai
that
as
it
was
james
yes
except
that
there
no
particular
disaster
at
sea
and
them
heathen
women
did
exert
no
blandishments
they
was
jest
pleasant
to
an
old
feller
bless
their
little
by
some
subtle
mental
process
ball
became
aware
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
you
ai
changed
nothin
here
jane
he
continued
hurriedly
there
the
haircloth
sofy
that
we
used
to
set
on
sunday
evenins
after
meetin
and
the
hair
wreath
with
the
red
rose
in
it
made
out
of
my
hair
and
the
white
rose
made
out
of
your
grandmother
hair
on
your
father
side
and
the
yeller
lily
made
out
of
the
hair
of
your
uncle
jed
youngest
boy
i
disremember
the
rest
but
time
was
when
i
could
say
all
i
never
see
your
beat
for
makin
hair
wreaths
jane
there
ai
nothin
gone
but
the
melodeon
that
used
to
set
by
the
mantel
what

of
the
melodeon
the
melodeon
is
set
away
in
the

hev
no
cat
there
ai
no
cat
james
that

get
into
a
melodeon
through
a
mouse
hole
more
especially
the
big
maltese
you
gave
me
i
kept
that
cat
james
as
you
may
say
all
these
weary
years
when
there
was
kittens
i
kept
the
one
that
looked
most
like
old
malty
but
of
late
years
the
cats
has
all
been
different
and
the
one
i
buried
jest
afore

sailed
away
was
yeller
and
white
with
black
and
brown
spots
a
kinder
tortoise
shell
that
did
look
nothin
like
malty
you
never
have
knowed
they
belonged
to
the
same
family
but
i
was
sorry
when
she
died
on
account
of
her
bein
the
last

half
frightened
put
her
head
into
the
room
dinner
ready
she
shouted
hurriedly
shutting
the
door
give
me
your
arm
james
said
ball
and
ruth
followed
them
into
the
the
retired
sailor
ate
heartily
casting
occasional
admiring
glances
at
ruth
and
hepsey
it
was
the
innocent
approval
which
age
bestows
upon
youth
these
be
the
finest
biscuit
he
said
that
i
had
for
many
a
day

reckon

young
woman

replied
hepsey

a
vulnerable
spot

decisively

jane

james

replied
aunt
jane
somewhat
harshly
on
account
of
her
mother

hathaway

confusion

she
said
who
would
best
print
it
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
handle
it
yourself
aunty
and
then
you
and
uncle
james
would
have
all
the
profits
if
you
let
some
one
else
publish
it
and
sell
it
you
have
only
ten
per
cent
and
even
then
you
might
have
to
pay
part
of
the
how
much
does
it
cost
to
print
a
book
that
depends
on
the
book
of
course
it
costs
more
to
print
a
large
one
than
a
small
that
need
make
no
difference
said
aunt
jane
after
long
deliberation
james
has
two
hundred
dollars
sewed
up
on
the
inside
of
the
belt
he
insists
on
wearin
instead
of
christian
suspenders

james
yes

hundred
and
four
dollars

my
belt
and
cents

my
it
from
his
store
ball
explained
he
sold
it
to
a
relative
of
one
of
them
heathen
it
was
worth
three
hundred
he
said
regretfully
now
james
you
know
a
small
store
like
that
ai
worth
no
three
hundred
dollars
i
would
have
let
you
took
three
hundred
it
would
be
the
arrival
of
a
small
and
battered
trunk
created
a
welcome
diversion
where
your
trunk
uncle
james
asked
ruth
i
ai
a
needin
of
no
trunk
he
answered
what
clothes

got

that

more
of
my
things
in
it
when

joe
upstairs

caution
and
direction

step

joe
obeyed
casting
longing
eyes
at
a
bit
of
blue
gingham
that
was
fluttering
among
the
currant
bushes
in
the
garden
ball
longing
for
conversation
with
his
kind
went
out
to
the
gate
and
stood
looking
up
at
him
blinking
in
the
bright
sunlight
young
feller

said

old
memory

the
evil
eye
ball
continued

replied
young

on
the

a
picture
of
blank
astonishment
i
was
engaged
to
both
of

each
one
of
it
secret
and
she
here
he
pointed
his
thumb
suggestively
toward
the
house
she
got
i
going
to
be
married
myself
volunteered
joe
proudly
merriage
is
a
fleetin
show
i
would
if
i
was
in
your
place
merriage
is
a
drag
on
a
man
ambitions
i
set
out
to
own
a
schooner
but
i
ca
never
do
it
now
on
account
of
bein
merried
i
had
a
good
start
towards
it
i
had
a
little
store
all
to
myself
what
was
worth
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
in
a
sunny
country
where
the
women
folks
had
soft
voices
and
pretty
ankles
and
was
above
passin
jokes
with
an
old
feller
to
cheer
on
lonely
ball
appeared
at
the
upper
window
james
she
called

and
get
your
hat

bald
spot

get
all
i
guess
i
wo
wait
no
longer
miss
hathaway
joe
shouted
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
turned
around
and
started
down
hill
ball
half
way
up
the
gravelled
walk
turned
back
to
smile
at
joe
with
feeble
jocularity
hearing
the
familiar
voice
hepsey
hastened
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
was
about
to
retreat
when
ball
stopped
her
pore
little
darlin
he
said
kindly
noting
her
tear
stained
face
do
go
wait
a
he
fumbled
at
his
belt
and
at
last
extracted
a
crisp
new
ten
dollar
bill
here
take
that
and
buy
you
a
ribbon
or
sunthin
to
remember
your
lovin
uncle
james
hepsey
face
brightened
and
she
hastily
concealed
the
bill
in
her
dress
i
ai
your
niece
she
said
hesitatingly
it
miss
that
do
make
no
difference
rejoined
ball
generously
willin
you
should
be
my
niece
too
all
pretty
young
things
is
my
nieces
and
i
loves
all
wo
you
give
your
pore
old
uncle
a
kiss
to
remember
you
by
ruth
who
had
heard
the
last
words
came
down
to
the
gravelled
walk
aunt
jane
is
coming
she
announced
and
hepsey
fled
when
the
lady
of
the
house
appeared
uncle
james
was
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
piazza
and
ruth
at
the
other
exchanging
decorous
commonplaces
xiii
plans
hepsey
had
been
gone
an
hour
before
ball
realised
that
she
had
sent
away
one
of
the
witnesses
of
her
approaching
wedding
it
do
matter
she
said
to
ruth
i
guess
there
others
to
be
had
i
got
the
dress
and
the
man
and
one
of
and
i
have
faith
that
the
other
things
will
nevertheless
the
problem
assumed
undue
proportions
after
long
study
she
decided
upon
the
minister
wife
if
that
the
numskulls
round
here
could
understand
two
weddin
she
said
i
have
it
in
the
church
as
me
and
james
first
preparations
for
the
ceremony
went
forward
with
aunt
jane
customary
decision
and
briskness
she
made
a
wedding
cake
assisted
by
ball
and
gathered
all
the
flowers
in
the
garden
there
was
something
pathetic
about
her
pleasure
it
was
as
though
a
wedding
had
been
laid
away
in
lavender
not
to
see
the
light
for
more
than
thirty
years
ruth
was
to
assist
in
dressing
the
bride
and
then
go
after
the
minister
and
his
wife
who
by
aunt
jane
decree
were
to
have
no
previous
warning
ai
necessary
to
tell
beforehand
not
as
i
see
said
ball
you
must
ask
fust
if
they
both
to
home
and
if
only
one
of
is
there
you
have
to
find
somebody
else
if
the
minister
to
home
and
his
wife
ai
gaddin
he
get
them
four
dollars
in
belt
leavin
an
even
two
hundred
or
do
you
think
two
dollars
would
be
enough
for
a
plain
marriage
i
leave
that
to
uncle
james
i
reckon
you
right
ruth
you
got
the
hathaway
the
old
wedding
gown
was
brought
down
from
the
attic
and
taken
out
of
its
winding
sheet
it
had
been
carefully
folded
but
every
crease
showed
plainly
and
parts
of
it
had
changed
in
colour
aunt
jane
put
on
her
best
foretop
which
was
entirely
dark
with
no
softening
grey
hair
and
was
reserved
for
occasions
of
high
state
a
long
brown
curl
which
was
hers
by
right
of
purchase
was
pinned
to
the
hard
uncompromising
twist
at
the
back
of
her
neck
ruth
helped
her
into
the
gown
and
as
it
slipped
over
her
head
she
inquired
from
the
depths
of
it
is
the
front
door
locked
yes
aunty
and
the
back
door
did
you
bring
up
the
keys
as
i
told
you
to
yes
aunty
here
they
are
why
there
was
a
pause
then
ball
said
solemnly
i
read
a
great
deal
about
bridegrooms
havin
wanderin
fits
immediately
before
weddin
does
my
dress
hike
up
in
the
back
ruth
it
was
a
little
shorter
in
the
back
than
in
the
front
and
cleared
the
floor
on
all
sides
since
she
had
grown
a
little
after
it
was
made
but
ruth
assured
her
that
everything
was
all
right
when
they
went
downstairs
together
ball
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
plainly
nervous
now
ruth
said
aunt
jane
you
can
go
after
the
minister
my
first
choice
is
methodis
after
that
baptis
and
then
presbyterian
i
will
entertain
james
durin
your
ruth
was
longing
for
fresh
air
and
gladly
undertook
the
delicate
mission
before
she
was
half
way
down
the
hill
she
met
winfield
who
had
come
on
the
afternoon
train
you
just
in
time
to
see
a
wedding
she
said
when
the
first
raptures
had
subsided
whose
wedding
sweetheart
ours
far
from
it
answered
ruth
laughing
come
with
me
and
i
she
gave
him
a
vivid
description
of
the
events
that
had
transpired
during
his
absence
and
had
invited
him
to
the
wedding
before
it
occurred
to
her
that
aunt
jane
might
not
be
pleased
i
may
be
obliged
to
recall
my
invitation
she
said
seriously
i
have
to
ask
aunty
about
it
she
may
not
want
that
does
make
any
difference
announced
winfield
in
high
spirits
i
agoin
to
the
wedding
and
i
to
kiss
the
bride
if
let
ruth
smothered
a
laugh
you
may
if
you
want
to
and
i
wo
be
jealous
is
that
sweet
of
me
you
always
sweet
dear
is
this
the
abode
of
the
parson
the
methodist
minister
was
at
home
but
his
wife
was
not
and
ruth
determined
to
take
winfield
in
her
place
the
clergyman
said
that
he
would
come
immediately
and
as
the
lovers
loitered
up
the
hill
they
arrived
at
the
same
time
winfield
was
presented
to
the
bridal
couple
but
there
was
no
time
for
conversation
since
aunt
jane
was
in
a
hurry
after
the
brief
ceremony
was
over
ruth
said
wickedly
aunty
on
the
way
to
the
minister
winfield
told
me
he
was
going
to
kiss
the
bride
i
hope
you
do
mind
winfield
looked
unutterable
things
at
ruth
but
nobly
fulfilled
the
obligation
uncle
james
beamed
upon
ruth
in
a
way
which
indicated
that
an
attractive
idea
lay
behind
it
and
winfield
created
a
diversion
by
tipping
over
a
vase
of
flowers
he
sha
he
whispered
to
ruth
be
darned
if
he
shall
ruth
said
aunt
jane
after
a
close
scrutiny
of
winfield
if
relayin
out
to
marry
that
awkward
creeter
what
ai
accustomed
to
a
parlour
you
better
do
it
now
while
him
and
the
minister
are
both
winfield
was
willing
but
ruth
said
that
one
wedding
at
a
time
was
enough
in
any
family
and
the
minister
pledged
to
secrecy
took
his
departure
the
bride
cut
the
wedding
cake
and
each
solemnly
ate
a
piece
of
it
it
was
a
sacrament
rather
than
a
festivity
when
the
silence
became
oppressive
ruth
suggested
a
walk
you
will
set
here
niece
ruth
remarked
aunt
jane
until
i
have
changed
my
uncle
james
sighed
softly
as
she
went
upstairs
well
he
said
i
merried
now
hard
and
fast
and
there
ai
no
help
for
it
world
without
cheer
up
uncle
said
winfield
consolingly
it
might
be
it
come
on
me
all
of
a
sudden
he
rejoined
i
ai
had
no
time
to
prepare
for
it
as
you
may
say
little
did
i
think
three
weeks
ago
as
i
set
in
my
little
store
what
was
wuth
four
or
five
hundred
dollars
that
before
the
month
was
out
i
be
merried
me
merried
he
exclaimed
me
as
never
thought
of
sech
when
ball
entered
clad
in
sombre
calico
ruth
overcome
by
deep
emotion
led
her
lover
into
the
open
air
it
bad
for
you
to
stay
in
there
she
said
gravely
when
you
are
destined
to
meet
the
same
i
had
time
to
prepare
for
it
he
answered
in
fact
i
had
more
time
than
i
they
wandered
down
the
hillside
with
aimless
leisure
and
ruth
stooped
to
pick
up
a
large
grimy
handkerchief
with
c
in
the
corner
here
where
we
were
the
other
morning
she
said
blessed
spot
he
responded
beautiful
hepsey
and
noble
joe
by
what
humble
means
are
great
destinies
made
evident
you
have
said
you
were
glad
to
see
me
i
always
glad
to
see
you
winfield
she
replied
primly
mr
winfield
is
my
name
he
objected
taking
her
into
his
arms
carl
she
whispered
shyly
to
his
coat
collar
that
is
all
of
carl
dear
said
ruth
with
her
face
crimson
that
more
like
it
now
let
sit
down
i
brought
you
something
and
you
have
three
returned
manuscript
no
you
said
they
were
all
another
piece
of
aunt
jane
wedding
cake
no
guess
chocolates
who
think
you
were
so
stupid
he
said
putting
two
fingers
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
oh
h
gasped
ruth
in
delight
you
funny
girl
did
you
expect
an
engagement
ring
let
see
if
it
he
slipped
the
gleaming
diamond
on
her
finger
and
it
fitted
exactly
how
did
you
guess
she
asked
after
a
little
it
was
wholly
guess
work
from
another
pocket
he
drew
a
glove
of
grey
suede
that
belonged
to
ruth
left
hand
where
did
you
get
that
by
the
log
across
the
path
that
first
day
when
you
were
so
cross
to
i
was
cross
yes
you
were
you
were
a
little
will
you
forgive
me
she
pleaded
lifting
her
face
to
his
rather
he
forgave
her
half
a
dozen
times
before
she
got
away
from
him
now
let
talk
sense
she
said
we
ca
i
never
expect
to
talk
sense
pretty
compliment
is
it
she
asked
it
like
your
telling
me
i
was
brilliant
and
then
saying
i
was
at
all
like
wo
you
forgive
me
he
inquired
significantly
some
other
time
she
said
flushing
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
well
he
began
i
saw
the
oculist
and
he
says
that
my
eyes
are
almost
well
again
but
that
i
must
use
them
for
two
weeks
longer
then
i
can
read
or
write
for
two
hours
every
day
increasing
gradually
as
long
as
they
do
hurt
by
the
first
of
october
he
thinks
i
be
ready
for
work
again
carlton
wants
me
to
report
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
and
he
offers
me
a
better
salary
than
i
had
on
the
that
good
we
have
to
have
a
flat
in
the
city
or
a
little
house
in
the
country
near

for
me
to
get
to
the

supplemented
ruth
what
do

think
you
going
to
do
miss
thorne
why
i
going
to
keep
right
on
with
the
paper
she
answered
in
surprise
no

he
said
putting
his
arm
around
her
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
have
carlton
or
any
other
man
giving
my
wife
an
assignment

ca
any
way
because
i
resigned
your
position
for
you
and
your
place
is
already
filled
carlton
sent
his
congratulations
and
said
his
loss
was
my
gain
or
something
like
that
he
takes
all
the
credit
to
why
why
you
wretch
i
not
a
wretch
you
said
yourself
i
was
nice
look
here
ruth
he
went
on
in
a
different
tone
what
do
you
think
i
am
do
you
think
for
a
minute
that
i
marry
you
if
i
could
take
care
of
you
is
that
she
replied
freeing
herself
from
his
encircling
arm
but
i
like
my
work
and
i
do

give
it
up
besides
besides
i
thought

near
me
sweetheart
that
is
the
point
you
have
the
same
right
that
i

your
natural
expression
but
in
spite
of
the
advanced
age
in
which
we
live
i
ca
help
believing
that
home
is
the
place
for
a
woman
i
may
be
but
i
want
my
wife
working
down
town
i
got

silent
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
hers

asking
you
to
let
your
soul

have
you
crave
expression
that

denied
you
but
i
do
want
you
to
have
to
work
when
you
do
feel
like
it
nor
be
at
anybody
beck
and
call
i
know
you
did
good
work
on
the
paper
carlton

of
it
too
but
others

it
as
well
i
want
you
to
do
something
that
is
so
thoroughly
you
that
no
one
else
can
do
it
it
a
hard
life
ruth
you
know
that
as
well
as
i

and
i
i
love
his
last
argument

convincing
i
wo

anything

want
me
to
do
dear
she
said
with
a
new
humility
i
want
you
to
be
happy
dearest
he
answered
quickly
just
try
my
way
for
a
year
that
all
i
ask
i
know
your
independence
is
sweet
to
you
but
the
privilege
of
working
for
you
with
hand
and
brain
with
your
love
in
my
heart
with
you
at
home
to
be
proud
of
me
when
i
succeed
and
to
give
me
new
courage
when
i
fail
why
it
the
sweetest
thing
ever
i
have
to
go
back
to
town
very
soon
though
she
said
a
little
later
i
am
interrupting
the
we
have
one
of
our
own
very
soon
that
you
ca
interrupt
and
when
you
go
back
i
going
with
you
we
buy
things
for
the
we
need
lots
of
things
do
we
she
asked
i
expect
we
do
darling
but
i
have
the
least
idea
what
they
are
you
have
to
tell
oriental
rugs
for
one
thing
she
said
and
a
mahogany
piano
and
an
instrument
to
play
it
with
because
i
have
any
parlour
tricks
and
some
good
pictures
and
a
waffle
iron
and
a
porcelain
rolling
what
do
you
know
about
rolling
pins
and
waffle
irons
he
asked
fondly
my
dear
boy
she
replied
patronisingly
you
forget
that
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
free
and
independent
woman
i
was
on
a
newspaper
i
know
lots
of
things
that
are
utterly
strange
to
you
because
in
all
probability
you
never
ran
a
woman
department
if
you
want
soup
you
must
boil
meat
slowly
and
if
you
want
meat
you
must
boil
it
rapidly
and
if
dough
sticks
to
a
broom
straw
when
you
jab
it
into
a
cake
it
is
he
laughed
joyously
how
about
the
porcelain
rolling
pin
it
germ
proof
she
rejoined
soberly
are
we
going
to
keep
house
on
the
antiseptic
plan
we
are
it
better
than
the
installment
plan
is
it
oh
carl
she
exclaimed
i
had
the
brightest
idea
spring
it
he
demanded
why
aunt
jane
attic
is
full
of
old
furniture
and
i
believe
give
it
to
us
his
face
fell
how
charming
he
said
without
emotion
oh
you
stupid
she
laughed
it
colonial
mahogany
every
stick
of
it
it
only
needs
to
be
done
over
ruth
you
a
wait
till
i
get
it
before
you
praise
me
just
stay
here
a
minute
and
i
run
up
to
see
what
frame
of
mind
she
when
she
entered
the
kitchen
the
bride
was
busily
engaged
in
getting
supper
uncle
james
with
a
blue
gingham
apron
tied
under
his
arms
was
awkwardly
peeling
potatoes
oh
how
good
that
smells
exclaimed
ruth
as
a
spicy
sheet
of
gingerbread
was
taken
out
of
the
oven
aunt
jane
looked
at
her
kindly
with
gratified
pride
beaming
from
every
feature
i
wish
you
teach
me
to

she
continued
following
up
her
advantage

aunty
ruth
went
on
quickly
though
feeling
that
the
moment
was
not
auspicious
you
know
all
that
old
furniture
up
in
the
attic
well
what
of
it
why
why
you
are
using
it
you

and
i
thought
perhaps

it
to
us
so
that
we
can
go
to
housekeeping
as
soon
as
we
it
was
your
grandmother
aunt
jane
replied
after
long
thought
and
as
you

i
ai
usin
it

but
what
you
might
as
well
have
it
as
anybody
else
i
lay
out
to
buy
me
a
new
haircloth
parlour
suit
with
that
two
hundred
dollars

the
minister
the
hull

above

she
concluded
ruth
kissed
her
with
real
feeling
thank
you
so
much
aunty
it
will
be
lovely
to
have
something
that
was
my
when
she
went
back
to
winfield
he
was
absorbed
in
a
calculation
he
was
making
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
you
not
to
use
your
eyes
she
said
warningly
and
oh
carl
it
was
my
grandmother
and
she
given
us
every
bit
of
it
and
you
to
stay
to
supper
must
be
in
a
fine
humour
he
observed
i
ever
so
glad
come
here
darling
you
do
know
how
i
missed
i
been
earning
furniture
she
said
settling
down
beside
him
people
earn
what
they
get
from
aunty
i
wo
say
that
though
because
it
tell
me
about
this
remarkable
furniture
what
is
it
and
how
much
of
it
is
destined
to
glorify
our
humble
cottage
it
all
ours
she
returned
serenely
but
i
do
know
just
how
much
there
is
i
did
look
at
it
closely
you
know
because
i
never
expected
to
have
any
of
it
let
see
there
a
heavy
dresser
and
a
large
round
table
with
claw
feet
that
our
and
a
bed
just
like
those
in
the
windows
in
town
when
it
done
over
and
there
a
big
sofa
and
a
are
you
going
to
spin
hush
do
interrupt
there
are
five
chairs
chairs
and
two
small
tables
and
a
card
table
with
a
leaf
that
you
can
stand
up
against
the
wall
and
two
lovely
rockers
and
i
do
know
what
that
a
fairly
complete
inventory
considering
that
you
look
at
it
closely
what
a
little
humbug
you
are
you
like
humbugs
do
you
some
not
there
was
a
long
silence
and
then
ruth
moved
away
from
him
tell
me
about
everything
she
said
think
of
all
the
years
i
have
known
you
there
nothing
to
tell
dear
are
you
going
to
conduct
an
excavation
into
my
indeed
i
not
the
present
is
enough
for
me
and
i
attend
to
your
future
there
not
much
to
be
ashamed
of
ruth
he
said
soberly
always
had
the
woman
i
should
marry
in
my
mind
not
impossible
she
and
my
ideal
has
kept
me
out
of
many
a
pitfall
i
wanted
to
go
to
her
with
clean
hands
and
a
clean
heart
and
i
have
i
not
a
saint
but
i
as
clean
as
i
could
be
and
live
in
the
world
at
ruth
put
her
hand
on
his
tell
me
about
your
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
and
he
waited
a
moment
before
speaking
my
mother
died
when
i
was
born
he
said
with
an
effort
i
ca
tell
you
about
her
ruth
she
she
was
a
very
good
forgive
me
dear
she
answered
with
quick
sympathy
i
do
want
to
know
i
did
know
about
it
until
a
few
years
ago
he
continued
when
some
kindly
disposed
relatives
of
father
gave
me
full
particulars
dead
now
and
i
glad
of
it
she
she
do
carl
she
cried
i
do
want
to
know
you
a
sweet
girl
ruth
he
said
tenderly
touching
her
hand
to
his
lips
father
died
when
i
was
ten
or
twelve
years
old
and
i
remember
him
very
well
though
i
have
one
picture
taken
a
little
while
before
he
was
married
he
was
a
moody
silent
man
who
hardly
ever
spoke
to
any
one
i
know
now
that
he
was
i
ca
remember
even
the
tones
of
his
voice
but
only
one
or
two
little
peculiarities
he
could
bear
the
smell
of
lavender
and
the
sight
of
any
shade
of
purple
actually
made
him
suffer
it
was
very
strange
i
picked
up
what
education
i
have
he
went
on
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
ruth
but
these
he
held
out
his
hands
and
my
that
all
i
want
dearest
do
tell
me
any
more
a
bell
rang
cheerily
and
when
they
went
in
aunt
jane
welcomed
him
with
apparent
cordiality
though
a
close
observer
might
have
detected
a
tinge
of
suspicion
she
liked
the
ring
on
ruth
finger
which
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
it
real
pretty
ai
it
james
she
asked
yes
is
it
just
come
to
my
mind
now
that
you
never
give
me
no
ring
except
this
here
one
we
was
married
with
i
guess
we
better
take
some
of
that
two
hundred
dollars
you
got
sewed
up
in
that
unchristian
belt
you
insist
on
wearin
and
get
me
a
ring
like
ruth
and
use
the
rest
for
furniture
do
you
think
so
yes
he
replied
ring
and
furniture
or
anythin
you
james
is
real
indulgent
she
said
to
winfield
with
a
certain
modest
pride
which
was
at
once
ludicrous
and
pathetic
he
should
be
ball
returned
the
young
man
gallantly
she
looked
at
him
closely
as
if
to
discover
whether
he
was
in
earnest
but
he
did
not
flinch
young
feller
she
said
you
ai
layin
out
to
take
no
excursions
on
the
water
be
you
not
that
i
know
of
he
answered
why
is
dangerous
she
returned
mis
ball
was
terrible
sea
sick
comin
here
remarked
her
husband
she
did
seem
to
have
no
sea
legs
as
you
may
ai
you
tired
of
dwellin
on
that
asked
aunt
jane
sharply
ai
no
disgrace
to
be
sea
sick
and
i
wa
the
only
winfield
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
question
and
the
troubled
waters
were
soon
calm
again
after
supper
ruth
said
aunty
may
i
take
winfield
up
to
the
attic
and
show
him
my
grandmother
things
that
you
just
given
me
run
along
child
me
and
james
will
wash
the
poor
james
said
winfield
in
a
low
tone
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
do
i
have
to
wash
dishes
ruth
it
would
surprise
me
you
said
you
wanted
to
work
for
me
and
i
despise
then
we
get
an
orphan
to
do
i
not
fitted
for
it
and
i
think
you
say
is
this
great
he
exclaimed
as
they
entered
the
attic
trunks
cobwebs
and
old
furniture
why
have
i
never
been
here
before
it
was
proper
replied
ruth
primly
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
him
no
go
away
they
dragged
the
furniture
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
it
over
critically
there
was
all
that
she
had
described
and
unsuspected
treasure
lay
in
concealment
behind
it
there
almost
enough
to
furnish
a
flat
she
cried
in
delight
he
was
opening
the
drawers
of
a
cabinet
which
stood
far
back
under
the
eaves
what
this
ruth
oh
it
old
blue
china
willow
pattern
how
rich
we
are
is
old
blue
china
considered
beautiful
of
course
it
is
you
goose
we
have
to
have
our
done
in
old
blue
now
with
a
shelf
on
the
wall
for
these
why
ca
we
have
a
red
because
it
would
be
a
fright
you
can
have
a
red
den
if
you
all
right
he
answered
but
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
simpler
and
save
a
good
deal
of
expense
if
we
just
pitched
the
plates
into
the
sad
sea
i
do
think
much
of
that
because
you
not
educated
dearest
returned
ruth
sweetly
when
you
married
you
know
a
great
deal
more
about
china
you
see
if
you
they
lingered
until
it
was
so
dark
that
they
could
scarcely
see
each
other
faces
we
come
up
again
she
said
wait
a
she
groped
over
to
the
east
window
where
there
was
still
a
faint
glow
and
lighted
the
lamp
which
stood
in
its
accustomed
place
newly
filled
you
not
going
to
leave
it
burning
are
you
he
asked
yes
aunt
jane
has
a
light
in
this
window
every
why
what
for
i
do
know
dearest
i
think
it
for
a
lighthouse
but
i
do
care
come
let
go
xiv
for
remembrance
the
next
day
while
ruth
was
busily
gathering
up
her
few
belongings
and
packing
her
trunk
winfield
appeared
with
a
suggestion
regarding
the
advisability
of
outdoor
exercise
uncle
james
stood
at
the
gate
and
watched
them
as
they
went
down
hill
he
was
a
pathetic
old
figure
predestined
to
loneliness
under
all
circumstances
that
the
way
i
look
when
we
been
married
a
few
years
said
carl
worse
than
that
returned
ruth
gravely
i
sorry
for
you
even
you
need
be
proud
and
haughty
just
because
you
had
a
wedding
at
your
house
we
going
to
have
one
at
at
ours
at
the
i
mean
this
very
that
nice
answered
ruth
refusing
to
ask
the
question
it
joe
and
hepsey
he
continued
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
stoop
low
enough
to
assist
me
in
selecting
an
appropriate
wedding
gift
in
yonder
seething
mart
i
feel
greatly
indebted
to
why
of
course
i
will
it
quite
sudden
is
it
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
so
however
it
the
most
reversed
wedding
i
ever
heard
of
a
marriage
at
the
home
of
the
groom
to
say
the
least
is
unusual
moreover
the
pendleton
is
to
take
the
bridal
tour
and
leave
the
happy
couple
at
home
she
going
to
visit
a
relative
who
is
distant
in
both
position
and
relationship
all
unknown
to
the
relative
i
fancy
she
starts
immediately
after
the
ceremony
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
pious
notion
to
throw
rice
and
old
shoes
after
why
carl
you
do
want
to
maim
her
do
you
i
would
mind
if
it
had
been
for
my
digestion
i
would
have
had
anything
to
worry
about
by
this
time
however
if
you
insist
i
will
throw
the
rice
and
let
you
heave
the
shoes
if
you
have
the
precision
of
aim
which
distinguishes
your
sex
the
will
escape
am
i
to
be
invited
certainly
have
i
already
invited
you
they
may
not
like
that
does
make
any
difference
lots
of
people
go
to
weddings
who
are
i
go
then
announced
ruth
and
once
again
i
give
you
my
gracious
permission
to
kiss
the
thank
you
dear
but
i
not
going
to
kiss
any
brides
except
my
own
i
signed
the
pledge
and
sworn
they
created
a
sensation
in
the
village
when
they
acquired
the
set
of
china
which
had
been
on
exhibition
over
a
year
during
that
time
it
had
fallen
at
least
a
third
in
price
though
its
value
was
unchanged
ruth
bought
a
hideous
red
which
she
knew
would
please
hepsey
greatly
to
winfield
disgust
why
do
you
do
that
he
demanded
do
you
know
that
in
all
probability
i
have
to
eat
off
of
it
i
much
prefer
the
oilcloth
to
which
i
am
now
you
have
to
get
used
to
table
linen
dear
she
returned
teasingly
it
my
ambition
to
have
one
just
like
this
for
state
joe
appeared
with
the
chariot
just
in
time
to
receive
and
transport
the
gift
here
your
wedding
present
joe
called
winfield
and
the
innocent
villagers
formed
a
circle
about
them
as
the
endeavoured
to
express
his
appreciation
winfield
helped
him
pack
the
pieces
on
the
back
seat
and
under
it
and
when
ruth
feeling
like
a
fairy
godmother
presented
the
red
his
cup
of
joy
was
full
he
started
off
proudly
with
a
soup
tureen
and
two
platters
on
the
seat
beside
him
the
red
was
slung
over
his
arm
in
toreador
fashion
and
the
normal
creak
of
the
conveyance
was
accentuated
by
an
ominous
rattle
of
crockery
then
he
circled
back
motioning
them
to
wait
here
sunthin
i
most
forgot
he
said
giving
ruth
a
note
i
drive
you
back
fer
nothin
only
i
got
sech
a
the
note
was
from
miss
ainslie
inviting
miss
thorne
and
her
friend
to
come
at
five
and
stay
to
tea
no
answer
was
expected
unless
she
could
not
come
the
quaint
script
was
in
some
way
familiar
a
flash
of
memory
took
ruth
back
to
the
note
she
had
found
in
the
dresser
drawer
beginning
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
understanding
so
it
was
miss
ainslie
who
had
sent
the
mysterious
message
to
aunt
jane
you
not
paying
any
attention
to
me
complained
winfield
i
suppose
when
we
married
i
have
to
write
out
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
and
put
it
on
you
a
goose
laughed
ruth
we
going
to
miss
ainslie
for
tea
are
we
getting
gay
indeed
we
are
weddings
and
teas
follow
one
another
like
regret
on
the
heels
of
pretty
simile
commented
ruth
if
we
go
to
the
tea
we
have
to
miss
the
well
we
been
to
a
wedding
quite
recently
so
i
suppose
better
to
go
to
the
tea
perhaps
by
arranging
it
we
might
be
given
nourishment
at
both
places
not
that
i
pine
for
the
cooking
anyhow
we
sent
our
gift
and
they
rather
have
that
than
to
have
us
if
they
were
permitted
to
do
you
suppose
they
give
us
anything
let
us
hope
i
do
believe
we
want
any
at
all
she
said
most
of
them
would
be
in
bad
taste
and
you
have
to
bury
them
at
night
one
at
a
time
while
i
held
a
the
policeman
on
the
beat
would
come
and
ask
us
what
we
were
doing
he
objected
and
when
we
told
him
we
were
only
burying
our
wedding
presents
he
would
believe
us
we
be
dragged
to
the
station
and
put
into
a
noisome
cell
would
it
make
a
pretty
story
for
the
morning
papers
the
people
who
gave
us
the
things
would
enjoy
it
over
their
it
would
be
pathetic
would
it
it
would
miss
thorne
i
think
we
better
not
tell
anybody
until
its
all
safely
over
and
then
we
can
have
a
little
card
printed
to
go
with
the
announcement
saying
that
if
anybody
is
inclined
to
give
us
a
present
we
rather
have
the
you
a
very
practical
person
carl
one
would
think
you
had
been
married
several
we
be
married
as
often
as
you
like
dear
judging
by
your
respected
aunt
one
ceremony
is
bindin
and
i
want
it
done
often
enough
to
be
sure
that
you
ca
get
away
from
as
they
entered
the
gate
uncle
james
approached
stealthily
by
a
roundabout
way
and
beckoned
to
them
excuse
me
he
began
as
they
came
within
speaking
distance
but
has
mis
ball
give
you
furniture
yes
replied
ruth
in
astonishment
why
there
clouds
to
starboard
and
she
repentin
she
been
of
it
the
hull
mornin
in
the
attic
i
was
sot
in
the
kitchen
with
pertaters
he
explained
but
the
work
is
wearin
and
a
feller
needs
fresh
thank
you
for
the
tip
uncle
said
winfield
heartily
the
old
man
glowed
with
gratification
we
men
understand
each
other
was
plainly
written
on
his
expressive
face
as
he
went
noiselessly
back
to
the
kitchen
you
better
go
home
dear
suggested
ruth
delicate
hint
replied
winfield
it
would
take
a
social
strategist
to
perceive
your
hidden
meaning
still
my
finer
sensibilities
respond
instantly
to
your
touch
and
i
will
go
i
flatter
myself
that
i
never
had
to
be
put
out
yet
when
i
been
calling
on
a
girl
some
subtle
suggestion
like
yours
has
always
been
do
be
cross
dear
let
see
how
soon
you
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
you
can
come
back
at
four
he
laughed
and
turned
back
to
wave
his
hand
at
her
she
wafted
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
which
seemed
momentarily
to
impede
his
progress
but
she
motioned
him
away
and
ran
into
the
house
aunt
jane
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
so
she
went
on
into
the
kitchen
to
help
uncle
james
with
the
potatoes
he
had
peeled
almost
a
peck
and
the
thick
parings
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
my
goodness
she
exclaimed
you
better
throw
those
out
uncle
and
i
put
the
potatoes
on
to
he
hastened
out
with
his
arms
full
of
peelings
you
a
real
kind
woman
niece
ruth
he
said
gratefully
when
he
came
in
you
favour
your
aunt
none
i
think
you
more
like
ball
entered
the
kitchen
with
a
cloud
upon
her
brow
and
in
one
of
those
rare
flashes
of
insight
which
are
vouchsafed
to
plodding
mortals
a
plan
of
action
presented
itself
to
ruth
aunty
she
said
before
ball
had
time
to
speak
you
know
i
going
back
to
the
city
and
i
like
to
send
you
and
uncle
james
a
wedding
present
you
been
so
good
to
me
what
shall
it
be
well
now
i
do
know
she
answered
visibly
softening
but
think
it
over
and
let
you
what
would
you
like
uncle
james
you
need
trouble
him
about
it
explained
his
wife
he
like
whatever
i
do
wo
you
james
yes
just
as
you
after
dinner
when
ruth
broached
the
subject
of
furniture
she
was
gratified
to
find
that
aunt
jane
had
no
serious
objections
i
kinder
hate
to
part
with
it
ruth
she
said
but
in
a
way
as
you
may
say
it
is
like
giving
it
away
aunty
it
all
in
the
family
and
as
you
say
you
not
using
that
so
and
then
james
and
me
are
likely
to
come
and
make
you
a
long
visit
so
i
get
the
good
of
it
ruth
was
momentarily
stunned
but
rallied
enough
to
express
great
pleasure
at
the
prospect
as
aunt
jane
began
to
clear
up
the
dishes
ball
looked
at
his
niece
with
a
certain
quiet
joy
and
then
unmistakably
winked
when
you
decide
about
the
wedding
present
aunty
let
me
know
you
she
asked
as
ball
came
in
after
the
rest
of
the
dishes
mr
winfield
would
like
to
send
you
a
remembrance
then
ruth
added
to
her
conscience
i
know
he
he
seems
like
a
feller
remarked
aunt
jane
you
can
ask
him
to
supper
if
you
thank
you
aunty
but
we
going
to
miss
huh
snorted
ball
mary
ainslie
ai
got
no
sperrit
with
this
enigmatical
statement
she
sailed
majestically
out
of
the
room
during
the
afternoon
ruth
finished
her
packing
leaving
out
a
white
to
wear
to
miss
ainslie
when
she
went
down
to
the
parlour
to
wait
for
winfield
aunt
jane
appeared
with
her
husband
in
her
wake
ruth
she
announced
me

james

decided
on
a
weddin
present
i
would
like
a
fine
linen
and
a
dozen
all

and

real
lace

in
the
early
years
of
our
engagement

ruth

elmiry
she
said
stroking
her
apron
thoughtfully
while
a
shadow
crossed
ball
expressive
face
but
i
guess
i
wait
now
till
i
get
my
new
black
silk
i
want
her
to
know
i
done
a
warning
hiss
from
the
kitchen
and
the
odour
of
burning
sugar
impelled
aunt
jane
to
a
hasty
exit
just
as
winfield
came
uncle
james
followed
them
to
the
door
niece
ruth
he
said
hesitating
and
fumbling
at
his
belt
be
you
goin
to
get
merried
i
hope
so
uncle
she
replied
kindly
then
then
i
wish
you
take
this
and
buy
you
sunthin
to
remember
your
pore
old
uncle
james
he
thrust
a
trembling
hand
toward
her
and
offered
her
a
twenty
dollar
bill
why
uncle
she
exclaimed
i
must
take
this
thank
you
ever
so
much
but
it
is
right
i
be
pleased
he
said
plaintively
as
if
i
wan
accustomed
to
money
my
store
was
wuth
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
and
you
been
real
pleasant
to
me
niece
ruth
buy
a
hair
wreath
for
the
parlour
or
sunthin
to
remind
you
of
your
pore
old
winfield
pressed
her
arm
warningly
and
she
tucked
the
bill
into
her
chatelaine
bag
thank
you
uncle
she
said
then
of
her
own
accord
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
a
mist
came
into
the
old
man
eyes
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
belt
again
but
she
hurriedly
led
winfield
away
ruth
he
said
as
they
went
down
the
hill
you
a
sweet
girl
that
was
real
womanly
kindness
to
the
poor
shall
i
be
equally
kind
to
all
devils
there
one
more
who
needs
you
if
you
attend
to
him
properly
it
will
be
i
do
see
how
they
going
to
get
aunty
silk
gown
and
a
ring
like
mine
and
a
haircloth
parlour
suit
and
publish
a
book
with
less
than
two
hundred
dollars
do
you
hardly
joe
says
that
he
gave
hepsey
ten
dollars
there
a
great
discussion
about
the
spending
of
i
did
know
i
feel
you
need
darling
there
was
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
how
did
you
succeed
with
your
delicate
mission
i
managed
it
she
said
proudly
i
feel
that
i
was
originally
destined
for
a
diplomatic
he
laughed
when
she
described
the
lemonade
set
which
she
had
promised
in
his
name
i
see
that
the
furniture
is
shipped
tomorrow
he
assured
her
and
then
i
go
on
a
still
hunt
for
the
gaudy
glassware
i
blessed
if
i
do
give
a
silver
ice
pitcher
i
in
for
a
and
a
dozen
napkins
laughed
ruth
but
i
do
mind
we
wo
bury
uncle
wedding
present
will
we
i
should
say
not
behold
the
effect
of
the
card
long
before
i
know
said
ruth
seriously
i
get
a
silver
spoon
or
something
like
that
out
of
the
twenty
dollars
and
then
i
spend
the
rest
of
it
on
something
nice
for
uncle
james
the
poor
soul
is
getting
any
wedding
present
and
he
never
there
a
moral
question
involved
in
that
replied
winfield
is
it
right
to
use
his
money
in
that
way
and
assume
the
credit
yourself
we
have
to
think
it
over
ruth
answered
it
is
so
very
simple
after
miss
ainslie
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
garden
and
came
to
the
gate
to
meet
them
she
wore
a
gown
of
lavender
taffeta
which
rustled
and
shone
in
the
sunlight
the
skirt
was
slightly
trained
with
a
dust
ruffle
underneath
and
the
waist
was
made
in
surplice
fashion
open
at
the
throat
a
bertha
of
rarest
brussels
lace
was
fastened
at
her
neck
with
the
amethyst
pin
inlaid
with
gold
and
surrounded
by
baroque
pearls
the
ends
of
the
bertha
hung
loosely
and
under
it
she
had
tied
an
apron
of
sheerest
linen
edged
with
narrow
duchesse
lace
her
hair
was
coiled
softly
on
top
of
her
head
with
a
string
of
amethysts
and
another
of
pearls
woven
among
the
silvery
strands
welcome
to
my
house
she
said
smiling
winfield
at
once
became
her
slave
she
talked
easily
with
that
exquisite
cadence
which
makes
each
word
seem
like
a
gift
but
there
was
a
certain
subtle
excitement
in
her
manner
which
ruth
did
not
fail
to
perceive
when
winfield
was
not
looking
at
miss
ainslie
her
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
a
wondering
hunger
mingled
with
tenderness
and
fear
midsummer
lay
upon
the
garden
and
the
faint
odour
of
mignonette
and
lavender
came
with
every
wandering
wind
white
butterflies
and
thistledown
floated
in
the
air
bees
hummed
drowsily
and
the
stately
hollyhocks
swayed
slowly
back
and
forth
do
you
know
why
i
asked
you
to
come
today
she
spoke
to
ruth
but
looked
at
winfield
why
miss
ainslie
because
it
is
my
birthday
i
am
years
ruth
face
mirrored
her
astonishment
you
do
look
any
older
than
i
do
she
said
except
for
the
white
hair
it
was
true
her
face
was
as
fresh
as
a
rose
with
the
morning
dew
upon
it
and
even
on
her
neck
where
the
folds
of
lace
revealed
a
dazzling
whiteness
there
were
no
lines
teach
us
how
to
live
miss
ainslie
said
winfield
softly
that
the
end
of
half
a
century
may
find
us
a
delicate
pink
suffused
her
cheeks
and
she
turned
her
eyes
to
his
i
just
been
happy
that
all
she
answered
it
needs
the
alchemist
touch
he
said
to
change
our
sordid
world
to
we
can
all
learn
she
replied
and
even
if
we
do
try
it
comes
to
us
what
asked
ruth
happiness
even
if
it
is
until
the
end
in
every
life
there
is
a
perfect
moment
like
a
flash
of
sun
we
can
shape
our
days
by
that
if
we
will
before
by
faith
and
afterward
by
the
conversation
drifted
to
less
serious
things
ruth
remembering
that
miss
ainslie
did
not
hear
the
village
gossip
described
her
the
dismissal
of
hepsey
and
told
her
of
the
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
that
evening
winfield
was
delighted
for
he
had
never
heard
her
talk
so
well
but
miss
ainslie
listened
with
gentle
displeasure
i
did
not
think
miss
hathaway
would
ever
be
married
abroad
she
said
i
think
she
should
have
waited
until
she
came
home
it
would
have
been
more
delicate
to
let
him
follow
her
to
seem
to
pursue
a
gentleman
however
innocent
one
may
be
is
is
winfield
choked
then
coughed
violently
understand
me
dear
miss
ainslie
went
on
i
do
not
mean
to
criticise
your
aunt
she
is
one
of
my
dearest
friends
perhaps
i
should
not
have
spoken
at
all
she
concluded
in
genuine
distress
it
all
right
miss
ainslie
ruth
assured
her
i
know
just
how
you
winfield
having
recovered
his
composure
asked
a
question
about
the
garden
and
miss
ainslie
led
them
in
triumph
around
her
domain
she
gathered
a
little
nosegay
of
for
ruth
who
was
over
among
the
hollyhocks
then
she
said
shyly
what
shall
i
pick
for
you
anything
you
like
miss
ainslie
i
am
at
a
loss
to
she
bent
over
and
plucked
a
leaf
of
rosemary
looking
at
him
long
and
searchingly
as
she
put
it
into
his
hand
for
remembrance
she
said
with
the
deep
fire
burning
in
her
eyes
then
she
added
with
a
pitiful
hunger
in
her
voice
whatever
happens
you
wo
forget
me
never
he
answered
strangely
stirred
thank
you
she
whispered
brokenly
drawing
away
from
him
you
look
so
much
like
like
some
one
i
used
to
at
dusk
they
went
into
the
house
except
for
the
hall
it
was
square
with
two
partitions
dividing
it
the
two
front
rooms
were
separated
by
an
arch
and
the
and
kitchen
were
similarly
situated
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
a
china
closet
and
pantry
between
them
miss
ainslie
table
of
solid
mahogany
was
covered
only
with
fine
linen
doilies
after
a
modern
fashion
and
two
quaint
candlesticks
of
solid
silver
stood
opposite
each
other
in
the
centre
in
a
silver
vase
of
foreign
pattern
there
was
a
great
bunch
of
asters
white
and
pink
and
blue
the
repast
was
simple
chicken
fried
to
a
golden
brown
with
creamed
potatoes
a
salad
made
of
fresh
vegetables
from
the
garden
hot
biscuits
deliciously
light
and
the
fragrant
chinese
tea
served
in
the
royal
kaga
cups
followed
by
pound
cake
and
pears
preserved
in
a
heavy
red
syrup
the
hostess
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
dispensing
a
graceful
hospitality
she
made
no
apology
such
as
prefaced
almost
every
meal
at
aunt
jane
it
was
her
best
and
she
was
proud
to
give
it
such
was
the
impression
afterward
when
ruth
told
her
that
she
was
going
back
to
the
city
miss
ainslie
face
grew
sad
why
why
must
you
go
she
asked
i
interrupting
the
honeymoon
ruth
answered
and
when
i
suggested
departure
aunty
agreed
to
it
immediately
i
ca
very
well
stay
now
can
i
my
dear
said
miss
ainslie
laying
her
hand
upon
ruth
if
you
could
if
you
only
would
wo
you
come
and
stay
with
me
i
love
to
replied
ruth
impetuously
but
are
you
sure
you
want
me
believe
me
my
dear
said
miss
ainslie
simply
it
will
give
me
great
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
next
day
ruth
trunk
should
be
taken
to
miss
ainslie
and
that
she
would
stay
until
the
first
of
october
winfield
was
delighted
since
it
brought
ruth
nearer
to
him
and
involved
no
long
separation
they
went
outdoors
again
where
the
crickets
and
katydids
were
chirping
in
the
grass
and
the
drowsy
twitter
of
birds
came
from
the
maples
above
the
moon
at
its
full
swung
slowly
over
the
hill
and
threads
of
silver
light
came
into
the
fragrant
dusk
of
the
garden
now
and
then
the
moonlight
shone
full
upon
miss
ainslie
face
touching
her
hair
as
if
with
loving
tenderness
and
giving
her
an
unearthly
beauty
it
was
the
face
of
a
saint
winfield
speaking
reverently
told
her
of
their
betrothal
she
leaned
forward
into
the
light
and
put
one
hand
caressingly
upon
the
arm
of
each
i
am
so
glad
she
said
with
her
face
illumined
through
the
music
of
her
voice
ran
lights
and
shadows
vague
womanly
appeal
and
a
haunting
sweetness
neither
could
ever
forget
that
night
the
gates
of
youth
turned
on
their
silent
hinges
for
miss
ainslie
forgetting
the
hoary
frost
that
the
years
had
laid
upon
her
hair
she
walked
hand
in
hand
with
them
through
the
clover
fields
which
lay
fair
before
them
and
by
the
silvered
reaches
of
the
river
of
dreams
into
their
love
came
something
sweet
that
they
had
not
found
before
the
absolute
need
of
sharing
life
together
whether
it
should
be
joy
or
pain
unknowingly
they
rose
to
that
height
which
makes
sacrifice
the
soul
dearest
offering
as
the
chrysalis
brown
and
unbeautiful
gives
the
radiant
creature
within
to
the
light
and
freedom
of
day
when
the
whistle
sounded
for
the
ten
train
ruth
said
it
was
late
and
they
must
go
miss
ainslie
went
to
the
gate
with
them
her
lavender
scented
gown
rustling
softly
as
she
walked
and
the
moonlight
making
new
beauty
of
the
amethysts
and
pearls
entwined
in
her
hair
ruth
aglow
with
happiness
put
her
arms
around
miss
ainslie
neck
and
kissed
her
tenderly
may
i
too
asked
winfield
he
drew
her
toward
him
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
miss
ainslie
trembled
from
head
to
foot
as
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
across
the
way
the
wedding
was
in
full
blast
but
neither
of
them
cared
to
go
ruth
turned
back
for
a
last
glimpse
of
the
garden
and
its
gentle
mistress
but
she
was
gone
and
the
light
from
her
candle
streamed
out
until
it
rested
upon
a
white
hollyhock
nodding
drowsily
to
ruth
walking
in
the
starlight
with
her
lover
it
seemed
as
if
the
world
had
been
made
new
the
spell
was
upon
winfield
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
he
spoke
if
i
could
have
chosen
my
mother
he
said
simply
she
would
have
been
like
miss
xv
the
secret
and
the
dream
ruth
easily
became
accustomed
to
the
quiet
life
at
miss
ainslie
and
gradually
lost
all
desire
to
go
back
to
the
city
you
spoiling
me
she
said
one
day
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
town
i
do
want
to
work
i
do
want
to
do
anything
but
sit
still
and
look
at
you
i
did
know
i
was
so
you
not
lazy
dear
answered
miss
ainslie
you
were
tired
and
you
did
know
how
tired
you
winfield
practically
lived
there
in
the
morning
he
sat
in
the
garden
reading
the
paper
while
ruth
helped
about
the
house
she
insisted
upon
learning
to
cook
and
he
ate
many
an
unfamiliar
dish
heroically
proclaiming
that
it
was
good
you
must
never
doubt
his
love
miss
ainslie
said
for
those
biscuits
well
dear
you
know
they
were
were
not
just
the
amateur
cook
laughed
outright
at
the
gentle
criticism
they
were
awful
she
admitted
but
i
going
to
keep
at
it
until
i
learn
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
divided
into
four
rooms
with
windows
on
all
sides
one
of
the
front
rooms
with
north
and
east
windows
was
miss
ainslie
while
the
one
just
back
of
it
with
south
and
east
windows
was
a
i
keep
my
prettiest
things
up
here
dear
she
explained
to
ruth
for
i
do
want
people
to
think
i
ruth
caught
her
breath
as
she
entered
the
room
for
rare
tapestries
hung
on
the
walls
and
priceless
rugs
lay
on
the
floor
the
furniture
like
that
downstairs
was
colonial
mahogany
highly
polished
with
here
and
there
a
chair
or
table
of
foreign
workmanship
there
was
a
cabinet
filled
with
rare
china
a
marquetry
table
and
a
chair
of
teakwood
inlaid
with
mother
of
pearl
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
large
chest
of
sandal
wood
inlaid
with
pearl
and
partly
covered
by
a
wonderful
antique
rug
the
world
had
seemingly
given
up
its
beauty
to
adorn
miss
room
she
had
pottery
from
mexico
china
and
japan
strange
things
from
egypt
and
the
nile
and
all
the
oriental
splendour
of
india
and
persia
ruth
wisely
asked
no
questions
but
once
as
before
she
said
hesitating
they
were
given
to
me
by
a
a
after
much
pleading
on
ruth
part
winfield
was
allowed
to
come
to
the
sitting
room
he
think
i
silly
dear
she
said
flushing
but
on
the
contrary
he
shared
ruth
delight
and
won
miss
ainslie
gratitude
by
his
appreciation
of
her
treasures
day
by
day
the
singular
attraction
grew
between
them
she
loved
ruth
but
she
took
him
unreservedly
into
her
heart
ruth
observed
idly
that
she
never
called
him
mr
at
first
she
spoke
of
him
as
your
friend
and
afterward
when
he
had
asked
her
to
she
yielded
with
an
adorable
shyness
and
called
him
carl
he
too
had
eaten
of
the
lotus
and
lost
the
desire
to
go
back
to
town
from
the
hilltop
they
could
see
the
yellow
fields
and
hear
the
soft
melody
of
reaping
from
the
valley
around
them
he
and
ruth
often
walked
together
but
miss
ainslie
never
would
go
with
them
she
stayed
quietly
at
home
as
she
had
done
for
many
years
every
night
when
the
last
train
came
from
the
city
she
put
a
lighted
candle
in
her
front
window
using
always
the
candlestick
of
solid
silver
covered
with
fretwork
in
intricate
design
if
winfield
was
there
she
managed
to
have
him
and
ruth
in
another
room
at
ten
she
took
it
away
sighing
softly
as
she
put
out
the
light
ruth
wondered
but
said
nothing
even
to
winfield
the
grain
in
the
valley
was
bound
in
sheaves
and
the
first
colour
came
on
the
maples
sometimes
in
a
delicate
flush
or
a
flash
of
gold
and
sometimes
like
a
wound
one
morning
when
miss
ainslie
came
downstairs
ruth
was
startled
at
the
change
in
her
the
quick
light
step
was
slow
and
heavy
the
broad
straight
shoulders
drooped
a
little
and
her
face
while
still
dimpled
and
fair
was
subtly
different
behind
her
deep
violet
eyes
lay
an
unspeakable
sadness
and
the
rosy
tints
were
gone
her
face
was
as
pure
and
cold
as
marble
with
the
peace
of
the
dead
laid
upon
it
she
seemed
to
have
grown
old
in
a
single
night
all
day
she
said
little
or
nothing
and
would
not
eat
she
simply
sat
still
looking
out
of
the
east
window
no
she
said
gently
to
ruth
nothing
is
the
matter
deary
i
just
when
winfield
came
she
kept
him
away
from
miss
ainslie
without
seeming
to
do
so
let
go
for
a
walk
she
said
she
tried
to
speak
lightly
but
there
was
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
a
tightening
at
her
heart
they
climbed
the
hill
and
took
the
side
path
which
led
to
the
woods
following
it
down
and
through
the
aisles
of
trees
to
the
log
across
the
path
ruth
was
troubled
and
sat
there
some
little
time
without
speaking
then
suddenly
she
knew
that
something
was
wrong
with
carl
her
heart
was
filled
with
strange
foreboding
and
she
vainly
tried
to
swallow
the
persistent
lump
in
her
throat
she
spoke
to
him
gently
once
or
twice
and
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
carl
she
cried
in
agony
carl
what
is
it
he
tried
to
shake
off
the
spell
which
lay
upon
him
nothing
darling
he
said
unsteadily
with
something
of
the
old
tenderness
i
weak
and
foolish
that
carl
dearest
she
cried
and
then
broke
down
sobbing
bitterly
her
tears
aroused
him
and
he
tried
to
soothe
her
ruth
my
darling
girl
do
cry
we
have
each
other
sweetheart
and
it
matter
nothing
matters
in
the
whole
wide
after
a
little
she
regained
her
come
out
into
the
sun
he
said
it
ghostly
here
you
do
seem
real
to
me
the
mist
filled
her
eyes
again
do
darling
he
pleaded
i
try
to
tell
they
sat
down
on
the
hillside
where
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
where
they
could
see
miss
ainslie
house
plainly
she
waited
frightened
and
suffering
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
before
he
spoke
last
night
ruth
he
began
my
father
came
to
me
in
a
dream
you
know
he
died
when
i
was
about
twelve
years
old
and
last
night
i
saw
him
as
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
lived
until
now
something
over
sixty
his
hair
and
beard
were
matted
and
there
was
the
most
awful
expression
in
his
eyes
it
makes
me
shudder
yet
he
was
in
his
grave
clothes
dead
and
yet
not
dead
he
was
suffering
there
was
something
he
was
trying
to
say
to
me
something
he
wanted
to
explain
we
were
out
here
on
the
hill
in
the
moonlight
and
i
could
see
miss
ainslie
house
and
hear
the
surf
behind
the
cliff
all
he
could
say
to
me
was
mary
mary
abby
she
mary
over
and
over
again
once
he
said
abby
was
my
mother
name
it
is
terrible
he
went
on
i
ca
understand
it
there
is
something
i
must
do
and
i
do
know
what
it
is
a
command
is
laid
on
me
by
the
dead
there
is
some
wrong
for
which
i
must
atone
when
i
first
awoke
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
but
it
is
it
real
it
seems
as
though
that
was
the
real
world
and
this
all
our
love
and
happiness
and
you
were
just
dreams
i
ca
bear
it
ruth
he
shuddered
and
she
tried
to
comfort
him
though
she
was
cold
as
a
marble
statue
and
her
lips
moved
with
difficulty
do
dear
she
said
it
was
only
a
dream
i
had
them
sometimes
so
vividly
that
they
haunted
me
for
days
and
as
you
say
it
seemed
as
if
that
was
the
real
world
and
this
the
dream
i
know
how
you
feel
those
things
pleasant
but
there
nothing
we
can
do
it
makes
one
feel
so
helpless
the
affairs
of
the
day
are
largely
under
our
control
but
at
night
when
the
body
is
asleep
the
mind
harks
back
to
things
that
have
been
forgotten
for
years
it
takes
a
fevered
fancy
as
a
fact
and
builds
upon
it
a
whole
series
of
disasters
it
gives
trivial
things
great
significance
and
turns
life
upside
down
remembering
it
is
the
worst
of
there
something
i
ca
get
at
ruth
he
answered
it
just
out
of
my
reach
i
know
it
reasonable
to
suppose
it
was
a
dream
and
that
it
can
be
explained
by
natural
causes
but
i
do
dream
very
i
dream
every
night
she
said
sometimes
they
just
silly
foolish
things
and
sometimes
they
vivid
and
horrible
realities
that
i
forget
for
weeks
but
surely
dear
we
not
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
dreams
no
i
hope
not
he
replied
doubtfully
let
go
for
a
little
walk
she
said
and
we
forget
then
she
told
him
how
changed
miss
ainslie
was
and
how
she
had
left
her
sitting
aimlessly
by
the
window
i
do
think
i
better
stay
away
long
she
concluded
she
may
need
i
wo
be
selfish
ruth
we
go
back
now
i
sorry
miss
ainslie
is
she
said
she
was
tired
but
it
is
like
her
to
be
tired
she
does
seem
to
want
anybody
near
her
but
you
can
sit
in
the
garden
this
afternoon
if
you
like
to
and
i
flit
in
and
out
like
an
industrious
butterfly
some
new
books
have
just
come
and
i
leave
them
in
the
arbour
for
all
right
dear
and
if
there
anything
i
can
do
i
hope
you
tell
as
they
approached
the
house
a
brisk
little
man
hurried
out
of
the
gate
and
went
toward
the
village
who
that
asked
winfield
i
do
know
some
one
who
has
brought
something
probably
i
trust
she
miss
ainslie
seemed
more
like
herself
as
she
moved
about
the
house
dusting
and
putting
the
rooms
in
order
as
was
her
wont
at
noon
she
fried
a
bit
of
chicken
for
ruth
but
took
nothing
herself
except
a
cup
of
tea
no
deary
she
said
in
answer
to
ruth
anxious
question
i
all
right
do
fret
about
have
you
any
pain
miss
ainslie
no
of
course
i
have
you
foolish
child
she
tried
to
smile
but
her
white
lips
quivered
pitifully
in
the
afternoon
when
she
said
she
was
cold
ruth
made
a
fire
in
the
open
fireplace
and
wheeled
miss
ainslie
favourite
chair
in
front
of
it
she
drew
her
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
leaned
back
i
so
comfortable
now
she
said
drowsily
i
think
i
going
to
sleep
ruth
sat
by
her
pretending
to
read
but
in
reality
watching
her
closely
until
the
deep
regular
breathing
assured
her
that
she
was
asleep
she
went
out
into
the
garden
and
found
winfield
in
the
arbour
how
this
patient
she
asked
kissing
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
i
all
right
dearest
he
answered
drawing
her
down
beside
him
and
i
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
was
so
during
the
afternoon
ruth
made
frequent
trips
to
the
house
each
time
finding
miss
ainslie
sound
asleep
it
was
after
six
when
she
woke
and
rubbed
her
eyes
wonderingly
how
long
have
i
been
asleep
ruth
all
the
afternoon
miss
ainslie
do
you
feel
better
now
yes
i
think
i
do
i
did
sleep
last
night
but
it
been
years
since
i
taken
a
nap
in
the
ruth
invited
carl
to
supper
and
made
them
both
sit
still
while
she
prepared
the
simple
meal
which
as
he
said
was
astonishingly
he
was
quite
himself
again
but
miss
ainslie
though
trying
to
assume
her
old
manner
had
undergone
a
great
change
carl
helped
ruth
with
the
dishes
saying
he
supposed
he
might
as
well
become
accustomed
to
it
and
feeling
the
need
of
sleep
went
home
very
early
i
all
right
he
said
to
ruth
as
he
kissed
her
at
the
door
and
you
just
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
good
night
a
chill
mist
came
inland
and
ruth
kept
pine
knots
burning
in
the
fireplace
they
sat
without
other
light
miss
ainslie
with
her
head
resting
upon
her
hand
and
ruth
watching
her
narrowly
now
and
then
they
spoke
aimlessly
of
commonplaces
when
the
last
train
came
in
miss
ainslie
raised
her
eyes
to
the
silver
candlestick
that
stood
on
the
mantel
and
sighed
shall
i
put
the
light
in
the
window
asked
ruth
it
was
a
long
time
before
miss
ainslie
answered
no
deary
she
said
sadly
never
any
she
was
trying
to
hide
her
suffering
and
ruth
heart
ached
for
her
in
vain
the
sound
of
the
train
died
away
in
the
distance
and
the
firelight
faded
ruth
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
going
away
miss
ainslie
where
i
do
know
dear
it
where
we
all
go
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourne
no
traveller
returns
sometimes
it
a
long
journey
and
sometimes
a
short
one
but
we
all
take
it
alone
at
the
ruth
heart
throbbed
violently
then
stood
still
do
she
cried
sharply
i
not
afraid
dear
and
i
ready
to
go
even
though
you
have
made
me
so
happy
you
and
miss
ainslie
waited
a
moment
then
continued
in
a
different
tone
the
lawyer
came
and
made
my
will
i
have
much
just
this
little
house
a
small
income
paid
and
my
my
things
all
my
things
are
for
you
the
house
and
the
income
are
for
for
ruth
was
crying
softly
and
miss
ainslie
went
to
her
laying
her
hand
caressingly
upon
the
bowed
head
do
deary
she
pleaded
do
be
unhappy
i
not
afraid
i
just
going
to
sleep
that
all
to
wake
in
immortal
dawn
i
want
you
and
him
to
have
my
things
because
i
love
you
because
i
always
loved
you
and
because
i
will
even
ruth
choked
down
her
sobs
and
miss
ainslie
drew
her
chair
closer
taking
the
girl
cold
hand
in
hers
that
touch
so
strong
and
gentle
that
had
always
brought
balm
to
her
troubled
spirit
did
not
fail
in
its
ministry
now
he
went
away
said
miss
ainslie
after
a
long
silence
as
if
in
continuation
of
something
she
had
said
before
and
i
was
afraid
he
had
made
many
voyages
in
safety
each
one
more
successful
than
the
last
and
he
always
brought
me
beautiful
things
but
this
time
i
knew
that
it
was
not
right
for
him
to
when
he
came
back
we
were
to
be
the
firelight
shone
on
the
amethyst
ring
as
miss
ainslie
moved
it
on
her
finger
he
said
that
he
would
have
no
way
of
writing
this
time
but
that
if
anything
happened
i
would
know
i
was
to
wait
as
women
have
waited
since
the
world
began
oh
ruth
do
you
know
what
waiting
means
mine
has
lasted
through
interminable
years
each
day
i
have
said
will
come
when
the
last
train
came
in
i
put
the
light
in
the
window
to
lead
him
straight
to
me
each
day
i
have
made
the
house
ready
for
an
invited
guest
and
i
have
gone
away
even
for
an
hour
i
could
bear
to
have
him
come
and
find
no
welcome
waiting
and
i
have
always
worn
the
colour
he
loved
when
people
have
come
to
see
me
i
always
been
afraid
they
would
stay
until
he
came
except
with
you
and
carl
i
was
glad
to
have
you
come
to
stay
with
me
because
lately
i
have
thought
that
it
would
be
more
more
delicate
than
to
have
him
find
me
alone
i
loved
you
too
dear
she
added
quickly
i
i
asked
your
aunt
to
keep
the
light
in
the
window
i
never
told
her
why
but
i
think
she
knew
and
you
must
tell
her
dear
the
next
time
you
see
her
that
i
thank
her
and
that
she
need
never
do
it
again
i
thought
if
he
should
come
in
a
storm
or
perhaps
sail
by
on
his
way
to
me
there
was
another
long
silence
then
with
an
effort
she
went
on
i
have
been
happy
for
he
said
he
wanted
me
to
be
though
sometimes
it
was
hard
as
nearly
as
i
could
i
made
my
dream
real
i
have
thought
for
hours
of
the
things
we
would
say
to
each
other
when
the
long
years
were
over
and
we
were
together
again
i
have
dressed
for
his
eyes
alone
and
loved
him
perhaps
you
know
i
know
miss
ainslie
said
ruth
softly
her
own
love
surging
in
her
heart
i
he
loved
me
ruth
she
said
lingering
upon
the
words
as
man
never
loved
before
in
all
of
god
great
universe
there
was
never
anything
like
that
even
in
heaven
there
ca
be
anything
so
beautiful
though
we
have
to
know
human
love
before
we
can
understand
god
all
day
i
have
dreamed
of
our
little
home
together
and
at
night
sometimes
of
baby
lips
against
my
breast
i
could
always
see
him
plainly
but
i
never
could
see
our
our
child
i
have
missed
that
i
have
had
more
happiness
than
comes
to
most
women
but
that
has
been
denied
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
her
lips
were
white
and
quivering
but
there
were
no
tears
at
length
she
sat
upright
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
ruth
do
be
afraid
of
anything
she
said
in
a
strange
tone
poverty
or
sickness
or
death
or
any
suffering
god
will
let
you
bear
together
that
is
love
to
be
afraid
there
only
one
thing
the
years
oh
god
the
bitter
cruel
endless
years
miss
ainslie
caught
her
breath
and
it
sounded
like
a
sob
but
she
bravely
kept
it
back
i
have
been
happy
she
said
in
pitiful
triumph
i
promised
him
that
i
would
be
and
i
have
kept
my
word
sometimes
it
was
hard
but
i
had
my
dream
lately
this
last
year
i
have
often
been
afraid
that
that
something
had
happened
years
and
you
know
dear
she
added
with
a
quaint
primness
that
i
am
a
woman
of
the
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
was
on
ruth
lips
but
she
did
not
say
it
still
i
know
it
was
wrong
to
doubt
him
i
could
when
i
thought
of
our
last
hour
together
out
on
the
hill
in
the
moonlight
he
said
it
was
conceivable
that
life
might
keep
him
from
me
but
death
never
could
he
told
me
that
if
he
died
i
would
know
that
he
would
come
and
tell
me
and
that
in
a
little
while
afterward
we
should
be
the
dying
embers
cast
a
glow
upon
her
face
it
was
almost
waxen
in
its
purity
she
seemed
transfigured
with
the
light
of
another
world
last
night
he
came
to
me
in
a
dream
he
is
dead
he
has
been
dead
for
a
long
time
he
was
trying
to
explain
something
to
me
i
suppose
he
was
trying
to
tell
me
why
he
had
not
come
before
he
was
old
an
old
man
ruth
and
i
have
always
thought
of
him
as
young
he
could
not
say
anything
but
my
name
abby
mary
abby
over
and
over
again
and
once
i
was
christened
abigail
but
i
never
liked
the
middle
name
so
i
dropped
it
and
he
used
to
tease
me
sometimes
by
calling
me
and
from
his
saying
i
know
that
he
too
wherever
he
may
be
has
had
that
dream
of
of
our
ruth
was
cold
from
head
to
foot
and
her
senses
reeled
every
word
that
winfield
had
said
in
the
morning
sounded
again
in
her
ears
what
was
it
that
went
on
around
her
of
which
she
had
no
ken
it
seemed
as
though
she
stood
absolutely
alone
in
endless
space
while
planets
swept
past
out
of
their
orbits
with
all
the
laws
of
force
set
suddenly
aside
miss
ainslie
felt
her
shuddering
fear
do
be
afraid
dear
she
said
again
everything
is
right
i
kept
my
promise
and
he
kept
his
he
is
suffering
he
is
very
lonely
without
me
but
in
a
little
while
we
shall
be
the
fire
died
out
and
left
the
room
in
darkness
broken
only
by
the
last
fitful
glow
ruth
could
not
speak
and
miss
ainslie
sat
quietly
in
her
chair
come
she
said
at
last
stretching
out
her
hand
let
go
upstairs
i
have
kept
you
up
deary
and
i
know
you
must
be
very
the
house
seemed
filled
with
a
shadowy
presence
something
intangible
but
portentous
for
both
good
and
ruth
took
down
the
heavy
mass
of
white
hair
and
brushed
it
back
tying
it
at
the
neck
with
a
ribbon
in
girlish
fashion
as
miss
ainslie
always
did
her
night
gown
of
sheerest
linen
was
heavy
with
valenciennes
lace
and
where
it
fell
back
from
her
throat
it
revealed
the
flesh
exquisitely
white
set
in
gracious
curves
and
womanly
softness
as
if
by
a
sculptor
who
loved
his
clay
the
sweet
wholesome
scent
of
the
lavender
flowers
breathed
from
the
folds
of
miss
ainslie
gown
as
she
stood
there
in
the
candle
light
smiling
with
the
unearthly
glow
still
upon
her
face
good
night
deary
she
said
you
kiss
me
wo
you
for
a
moment
the
girl
face
was
buried
among
miss
ainslie
laces
then
their
lips
met
ruth
was
trembling
and
she
hurried
away
swallowing
the
lump
in
her
throat
and
trying
to
keep
back
the
tears
the
doors
were
open
and
there
was
no
sound
save
miss
ainslie
deep
breathing
but
ruth
kept
a
dreary
vigil
till
almost
dawn
xvi
some
one
who
loved
her
the
summer
waned
and
each
day
as
it
slipped
away
took
a
little
of
miss
ainslie
strength
with
it
there
was
neither
disease
nor
pain
it
was
simply
a
letting
go
carl
sent
to
the
city
for
a
physician
of
wide
repute
but
he
shook
his
head
there
nothing
the
matter
with
her
he
said
but
she
does
want
to
live
just
keep
her
as
happy
as
you
for
a
time
she
went
about
the
house
as
usual
but
gradually
more
and
more
of
her
duties
fell
to
ruth
hepsey
came
in
every
day
after
breakfast
and
again
in
the
late
afternoon
ruth
tried
to
get
her
to
go
out
for
a
drive
but
she
refused
no
deary
she
said
smiling
i
never
been
away
and
i
too
old
to
begin
neighbours
hearing
of
her
illness
came
to
offer
sympathy
and
help
but
she
would
see
none
of
them
not
even
aunt
jane
one
night
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
as
usual
for
she
would
not
surrender
her
place
as
hostess
even
though
she
ate
nothing
and
afterward
a
great
weakness
came
upon
her
i
do
know
how
i
ever
get
upstairs
she
said
frightened
it
seems
such
a
long
way
winfield
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
up
as
gently
and
easily
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
bright
when
he
put
her
down
i
never
thought
it
would
be
so
easy
she
said
in
answer
to
his
question
you
stay
with
me
wo
you
carl
i
do
want
you
to
go
i
stay
as
long
as
you
want
me
miss
ainslie
and
ruth
will
too
we
could
do
too
much
for
that
night
as
they
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
while
miss
ainslie
slept
upstairs
ruth
told
him
what
she
had
said
about
leaving
him
the
house
and
the
little
income
and
giving
her
the
beautiful
things
in
the
house
bless
her
sweet
heart
he
said
tenderly
we
do
want
her
things
we
rather
have
indeed
we
would
she
answered
quickly
until
the
middle
of
september
she
went
back
and
forth
from
her
own
room
to
the
with
comparative
ease
they
took
turns
bringing
dainties
to
tempt
her
appetite
but
though
she
ate
a
little
of
everything
and
praised
it
warmly
especially
if
ruth
had
made
it
she
did
it
evidently
only
out
of
consideration
for
them
she
read
a
little
talked
a
little
and
slept
a
great
deal
one
day
she
asked
carl
to
pull
the
heavy
sandal
wood
chest
over
near
her
chair
and
give
her
the
key
which
hung
behind
a
picture
will
you
please
go
away
now
she
asked
with
a
winning
smile
for
just
a
little
while
he
put
the
bell
on
a
table
within
her
reach
and
asked
her
to
ring
if
she
wanted
anything
the
hours
went
by
and
there
was
no
sound
at
last
he
went
up
very
quietly
and
found
her
asleep
the
chest
was
locked
and
the
key
was
not
to
be
found
he
did
not
know
whether
she
had
opened
it
or
not
but
she
let
him
put
it
in
its
place
again
without
a
word
sometimes
they
read
to
her
and
she
listened
patiently
occasionally
asking
a
question
but
more
often
falling
asleep
i
wish
she
said
one
day
when
she
was
alone
with
carl
that
i
could
hear
something
you
had
why
miss
ainslie
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
you
would
be
interested
in
the
things
i
write
it
only
newspaper
yes
i
would
she
answered
softly
yes
i
something
in
the
way
she
said
it
brought
the
mist
to
his
eyes
she
liked
to
have
ruth
brush
her
hair
but
her
greatest
delight
was
in
hearing
winfield
talk
about
her
treasures
wo
you
tell
me
about
the
rug
carl
the
one
on
the
sandal
wood
chest
she
asked
for
the
twentieth
time
it
hundreds
of
years
old
he
began
and
it
came
from
persia
far
far
beyond
the
sea
the
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
night
and
day
and
saved
the
finest
fleeces
for
the
rug
they
made
colour
from
flowers
and
sweet
herbs
from
strange
things
that
grew
on
the
mountain
heights
where
only
the
bravest
dared
to
go
the
sumac
that
flamed
on
the
hills
the
rind
of
the
swaying
pomegranates
lichens
that
grew
on
the
rocks
by
the
eastern
sea
berries
treasures
vine
leaves
the
juice
of
the
grape
they
all
made
colours
for
the
rug
and
then
ripened
like
old
wine
after
a
long
time
when
everything
was
ready
the
master
craftsman
made
the
design
writing
strange
symbols
into
the
margin
eloquent
with
hidden
meanings
that
only
the
wisest
may
understand
they
all
worked
upon
it
men
and
women
and
children
deep
voices
sang
love
songs
and
the
melody
was
woven
into
the
rug
soft
eyes
looked
love
in
answer
and
the
softness
and
beauty
went
in
with
the
fibre
baby
fingers
clutched
at
it
and
were
laughingly
untangled
at
night
when
the
fires
of
the
village
were
lighted
and
the
crimson
glow
was
reflected
upon
it
strange
tales
of
love
and
war
were
mingled
with
the
thread
the
nightingale
sang
into
it
the
roses
from
persian
gardens
breathed
upon
it
the
moonlight
put
witchery
into
it
the
tinkle
of
the
gold
and
silver
on
the
women
dusky
ankles
the
scent
of
sandal
wood
and
attar
of
rose
it
all
went
into
the
rug
poets
repeated
their
verses
to
it
men
knelt
near
it
to
say
their
prayers
and
the
soft
wind
rising
from
the
sea
made
faintest
music
among
the
threads
sometimes
a
workman
made
a
mistake
and
the
master
craftsman
put
him
aside
often
the
patient
fingers
stopped
weaving
forever
and
they
found
some
one
else
to
go
on
with
it
sometimes
they
went
from
one
place
to
another
but
the
frame
holding
the
rug
was
not
injured
from
mountain
to
valley
and
back
again
urged
by
some
strange
instinct
past
flowing
rivers
and
over
the
golden
sands
of
the
desert
even
to
the
deep
blue
waters
that
broke
on
the
shore
they
took
the
rug
the
of
arabian
horses
with
bedouins
flashing
their
swords
all
the
glitter
and
splendour
of
war
were
woven
into
it
songs
of
victory
the
rush
of
a
cavalry
charge
the
faith
of
a
dying
warrior
even
the
slow
marches
of
defeat
it
all
went
into
the
rug
perhaps
the
master
craftsman
died
but
the
design
was
left
and
willing
fingers
toiled
upon
it
through
the
long
years
each
day
putting
new
beauty
into
it
and
new
dreams
then
one
day
the
final
knot
was
tied
by
a
veiled
lady
who
sighed
softly
in
the
pauses
of
her
song
and
wondered
at
its
surpassing
and
said
miss
ainslie
gently
some
one
who
loved
you
brought
it
to
yes
she
repeated
smiling
some
one
who
loved
me
tell
me
about
this
she
pleaded
touching
a
vase
of
cloisonne
it
came
from
japan
he
said
a
strange
world
of
people
like
those
painted
on
a
fan
the
streets
are
narrow
and
there
are
quaint
houses
on
either
side
the
little
ladies
flit
about
in
gay
attire
like
so
many
butterflies
they
wear
queer
shoes
on
their
dainty
feet
they
as
sweet
as
their
own
cherry
blossoms
the
little
man
who
made
this
vase
wore
a
blue
tunic
and
had
no
robes
of
state
because
he
was
poor
he
loved
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
and
she
loved
him
too
though
neither
dared
to
say
so
so
he
sat
in
front
of
his
house
and
worked
on
this
vase
he
made
a
model
of
clay
shaping
it
with
his
fingers
until
it
was
perfect
then
a
silver
vase
was
cast
from
it
and
over
and
over
it
he
went
very
carefully
making
a
design
with
flat
silver
wire
when
he
was
satisfied
with
it
he
filled
it
in
with
enamel
in
wonderful
colours
making
even
the
spots
on
the
butterflies
wings
like
those
he
had
seen
in
the
fields
outside
the
design
he
covered
the
vase
with
dark
enamel
so
the
bright
colours
would
show
as
he
worked
the
little
lady
he
loved
came
and
watched
him
sometimes
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
he
put
a
tiny
bit
of
gold
into
the
vase
he
put
a
flower
into
the
design
like
those
she
wore
in
her
hair
and
then
another
like
the
one
she
dropped
at
his
feet
one
day
when
no
one
was
looking
the
artist
put
all
his
love
into
the
vase
and
he
hoped
that
when
it
was
done
he
could
obtain
a
court
position
he
was
very
patient
with
the
countless
polishings
and
one
afternoon
when
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
odour
of
the
cherry
blossoms
the
last
touches
were
put
upon
it
it
was
so
beautiful
that
he
was
commissioned
to
make
some
great
vases
for
the
throne
room
and
then
with
joy
in
his
heart
he
sought
the
hand
of
the
nobleman
daughter
the
negotiations
were
conducted
by
another
person
and
she
was
forced
to
consent
though
her
heart
ached
for
the
artist
in
the
blue
tunic
whose
name
she
did
not
know
when
she
learned
that
her
husband
was
to
be
the
man
she
had
loved
for
so
long
tears
of
happiness
came
into
her
dark
eyes
the
vase
had
disappeared
mysteriously
and
he
offered
a
large
reward
for
its
recovery
at
last
they
were
compelled
to
give
up
the
hope
of
finding
it
and
he
promised
to
make
her
another
one
just
like
it
with
the
same
flowers
and
butterflies
and
even
the
little
glints
of
gold
that
marked
the
days
she
came
so
she
watched
him
while
he
made
the
new
one
and
even
more
love
went
into
it
than
into
the
first
and
began
miss
ainslie
some
one
who
loved
you
brought
it
to
yes
she
repeated
smiling
some
one
who
loved
winfield
fitted
a
story
to
every
object
in
the
room
each
rug
had
a
different
history
and
every
bit
of
tapestry
its
own
tale
he
conjured
up
an
empress
who
had
once
owned
the
teakwood
chair
and
a
marquise
with
patches
and
powdered
hair
who
wrote
love
letters
at
the
marquetry
table
he
told
stories
of
the
sea
shells
and
of
the
mermaids
who
brought
them
to
the
shore
that
some
one
who
loved
her
might
take
them
to
her
and
that
the
soft
sound
of
the
sea
might
always
come
to
her
ears
with
visions
of
blue
skies
and
tropic
islands
where
the
sun
forever
shone
the
empress
and
the
marquise
became
real
people
to
miss
ainslie
and
the
japanese
lovers
seemed
to
smile
at
her
from
the
vase
sometimes
holding
the
rug
on
her
lap
she
would
tell
them
how
it
was
woven
and
repeat
the
love
story
of
a
beautiful
woman
who
had
worked
upon
the
tapestry
often
in
the
twilight
she
would
sing
softly
to
herself
snatches
of
forgotten
melodies
and
once
a
lullaby
ruth
and
carl
sat
by
watching
for
the
slightest
change
but
she
never
spoke
of
the
secret
in
her
heart
ruth
had
the
north
room
across
the
hall
where
there
were
two
dressers
one
of
them
had
been
empty
until
she
put
her
things
into
it
and
the
other
was
locked
she
found
the
key
one
day
hanging
behind
it
when
she
needed
some
things
for
miss
ainslie
as
she
had
half
expected
the
dresser
was
full
of
lingerie
of
the
finest
lawn
and
linen
the
dainty
garments
were
edged
with
real
lace
brussels
valenciennes
mechlin
point
and
the
fine
irish
laces
sometimes
there
was
a
cluster
of
tucks
daintily
run
by
hand
but
usually
only
the
lace
unless
there
was
a
bit
of
insertion
to
match
the
buttons
were
mother
of
pearl
and
the
button
holes
were
exquisitely
made
one
or
two
of
the
garments
were
threaded
with
white
ribbon
after
a
more
modern
fashion
but
most
of
them
were
made
according
to
the
quaint
old
patterns
there
was
a
dozen
of
everything
the
dried
lavender
flowers
rustled
faintly
as
ruth
reverently
lifted
the
garments
giving
out
the
sweetness
of
summers
gone
by
the
white
had
changed
to
an
ivory
tint
growing
deeper
every
day
there
were
eleven
night
gowns
all
made
exactly
alike
with
high
neck
and
long
sleeves
trimmed
with
tucks
and
lace
only
one
was
in
any
way
elaborate
the
sleeves
were
short
evidently
just
above
the
elbow
and
the
neck
was
cut
off
the
shoulders
like
a
ball
gown
a
deep
frill
of
venetian
point
with
narrower
lace
at
the
sleeves
of
the
same
pattern
was
the
only
trimming
except
a
tiny
bow
of
lavender
ribbon
at
the
fastening
pinned
on
with
a
little
gold
heart
when
ruth
went
in
with
one
of
the
night
gowns
over
her
arm
a
faint
colour
came
into
miss
ainslie
cheeks
did
did
you
find
those
she
asked
yes
answered
ruth
i
thought
you
like
to
wear
miss
ainslie
colour
faded
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
spoke
again
did
did
you
find
the
other
the
one
with
venetian
point
yes
miss
ainslie
do
you
want
that
one
it
no
she
said
not
now
but
i
thought
that
i
like
to
wear
that
afterward
you
a
shadow
crossed
ruth
face
and
her
lips
tightened
do
dear
said
miss
ainslie
gently
do
you
think
he
would
think
it
was
indelicate
if
if
my
neck
were
bare
then
who
miss
ainslie
carl
would
he
think
it
was
wrong
if
i
wore
that
afterward
and
my
neck
and
shoulders
showed
do
you
think
he
would
no
cried
ruth
i
know
he
would
oh
miss
ainslie
you
break
my
heart
ruth
said
miss
ainslie
gently
ruth
dear
do
cry
i
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
deary
i
promise
you
but
i
wanted
to
know
so
much
ruth
kissed
her
and
went
away
unable
to
bear
more
just
then
she
brought
her
chair
into
the
hall
to
be
near
her
if
she
were
needed
miss
ainslie
sighed
and
then
began
to
croon
a
lullaby
xvii
dawn
as
miss
ainslie
became
weaker
she
clung
to
carl
and
was
never
satisfied
when
he
was
out
of
her
sight
when
she
was
settled
in
bed
for
the
night
he
went
in
to
sit
by
her
and
hold
her
hand
until
she
dropped
asleep
if
she
woke
during
the
night
she
would
call
ruth
and
ask
where
he
was
he
come
over
in
the
morning
miss
ainslie
ruth
always
said
you
know
it
night
is
it
she
would
ask
drowsily
i
must
go
to
sleep
then
deary
so
that
i
may
be
quite
rested
and
refreshed
when
he
her
room
in
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
house
was
almost
puritan
in
its
simplicity
the
bed
and
dresser
were
mahogany
plain
but
highly
polished
and
she
had
a
mahogany
rocker
with
a
cushion
of
old
blue
tapestry
there
was
a
simple
white
cover
on
the
bed
and
another
on
the
dresser
but
the
walls
were
dead
white
unrelieved
by
pictures
or
draperies
in
the
east
window
was
a
long
narrow
footstool
and
a
prayer
book
and
hymnal
lay
on
the
window
sill
where
this
maiden
of
half
a
century
looking
seaward
knelt
to
say
her
prayers
one
morning
when
ruth
went
in
she
said
i
think
i
wo
get
up
this
morning
dear
i
am
so
very
tired
if
carl
should
come
over
will
you
say
that
i
should
like
to
see
him
she
would
see
no
one
but
carl
and
ruth
and
ball
was
much
offended
because
her
friend
did
not
want
her
to
come
upstairs
do
be
harsh
with
her
aunt
jane
pleaded
ruth
you
know
people
often
have
strange
fancies
when
they
are
she
sent
her
love
to
you
and
asked
me
to
say
that
she
thanked
you
but
you
need
not
put
the
light
in
the
attic
window
any
ball
gazed
at
her
niece
long
and
earnestly
be
you
tellin
me
the
truth
she
asked
why
of
course
then
mary
ainslie
has
got
sense
from
somewheres
there
ai
never
been
no
need
for
that
lamp
to
set
in
the
winder
and
when
she
gets
more
sense
i
reckon
she
be
willin
to
see
her
with
evident
relief
upon
her
face
ball
departed
but
miss
ainslie
seemed
quite
satisfied
and
each
day
spoke
more
lovingly
to
ruth
and
carl
he
showed
no
signs
of
impatience
but
spent
his
days
with
her
cheerfully
he
read
to
her
held
her
hand
and
told
her
about
the
rug
the
marquise
and
the
japanese
lovers
at
the
end
she
would
always
say
with
a
quiet
tenderness
and
some
one
who
loved
me
brought
it
to
me
yes
miss
ainslie
some
one
who
loved
you
everybody
loves
you
you
know
that
do
you
she
asked
once
suddenly
and
yet
shyly
indeed
i
do
miss
ainslie
i
love
you
with
all
my
she
smiled
happily
and
her
eyes
filled
ruth
she
called
softly
he
says
he
loves
me
of
course
he
does
said
ruth
nobody
in
the
wide
world
could
help
loving
she
put
out
her
left
hand
to
touch
ruth
and
the
amethyst
ring
slipped
off
for
her
fingers
were
thin
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
when
ruth
slipped
it
on
again
and
shortly
afterward
fell
asleep
that
night
winfield
stayed
very
late
i
do
want
to
leave
you
dear
he
said
to
ruth
i
afraid
something
is
going
to
i
not
afraid
i
think
you
better
will
you
put
a
light
in
your
window
if
you
want
me
darling
yes
i
i
can
see
it
from
my
room
and
i
be
watching
for
it
if
you
want
me
i
he
awoke
from
an
uneasy
sleep
with
the
feeling
that
ruth
needed
him
and
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
light
from
her
candle
streaming
out
into
the
darkness
he
dressed
hurriedly
glancing
at
his
watch
by
the
light
of
a
match
it
was
just
three
ruth
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
lower
door
is
she
is
she
no
she
seems
to
be
just
the
same
but
she
wants
you
she
been
calling
for
you
ever
since
you
went
as
they
went
upstairs
miss
ainslie
sweet
voice
came
to
them
in
pitiful
pleading
carl
carl
dear
where
are
you
i
want
you
i
here
miss
ainslie
he
said
sitting
down
on
the
bed
beside
her
and
taking
her
hot
hands
in
his
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
me
about
the
with
no
hint
of
weariness
in
his
deep
quiet
voice
he
told
her
the
old
story
once
more
when
he
had
finished
she
spoke
again
i
ca
seem
to
get
it
just
right
about
the
japanese
lovers
were
they
married
yes
they
were
married
and
lived
happily
ever
afterward
like
the
people
in
the
fairy
that
was
lovely
she
said
with
evident
satisfaction
do
you
think
they
wanted
me
to
have
their
vase
i
know
they
did
some
one
who
loved
you
brought
it
to
you
everybody
loves
you
miss
did
the
marquise
find
her
lover
yes
or
rather
he
found
did
they
want
me
to
have
their
marquetry
table
of
course
they
did
did
some
one
who
loved
you
bring
it
to
you
yes
she
sighed
some
one
who
loved
she
sang
a
little
very
softly
with
her
eyes
closed
it
was
a
quaint
tune
with
a
refrain
of
and
he
held
her
hand
until
the
song
ceased
and
she
was
asleep
then
he
went
over
to
ruth
ca

to
sleep
for
a
little
while
dearest
i
know
i
never
tired
when
i

ruth
answered
leaning
upon
his
arm
and
besides
i
feel
that
this
is
the
miss
ainslie
slept
for
some
time
then
all
at
once
she
started
as
if
in
terror
letters
she
said
very
distinctly
go
he
went
to
her
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
failed
no
she
said
again
letters

wants
some
letters
that
are
in
the
sandal
wood
chest
he
said
to
ruth
and
miss
ainslie
nodded
yes
she
repeated
ruth
went
into
the
where
a
light
was
burning
dimly
but
the
chest
was
locked
do
you
know
where
the
key
is
carl
she
asked
coming
back
for
a
moment
no
i

he
answered
then
he
asked
miss
ainslie
where
the
key
was
but
she
only
murmured

i
go
and
help
ruth
find
them
yes
she
said
help
together
they
broke
open
the
lock
of
the
chest
while
miss
ainslie
was
calling
faintly
carl
carl
dear
where
are
you
i
want
you
we
better
turn
the
whole
thing
out
on
the
floor
he
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
then
put
it
back
against
the
wall
empty
have
to
shake
everything
out
carefully
returned
ruth
that
the
only
way
to
find
wrapped
carefully
in
a
fine
linen
sheet
was
miss
ainslie
wedding
gown
of
heavy
white
satin
trimmed
simply
with
priceless
venetian
point
they
shook
it
out
hurriedly
and
put
it
back
into
the
chest
there
were
yards
upon
yards
of
lavender
taffeta
cut
into
dress
lengths
which
they
folded
up
and
put
away
three
strings
of
amethysts
and
two
of
pearls
slipped
out
of
the
silk
as
they
lifted
it
and
there
was
another
length
of
lustrous
white
taffeta
which
had
changed
to
an
ivory
tint
four
shawls
of
canton
crepe
three
of
them
lavender
and
one
ivory
white
were
put
back
into
the
chest
there
were
several
fans
of
fine
workmanship
a
girdle
of
oxidized
silver
set
with
amethysts
and
pearls
and
a
large
marquetry
box
which
contained
tea
that
all
the
large
things
he
said
now
we
can
look
these
ruth
was
gathering
up
great
quantities
of
lace
brussels
point
cluny
mechlin
valenciennes
duchesse
and
venetian
point
there
was
a
bridal
veil
of
the
venetian
lace
evidently
made
to
match
that
on
the
gown
tiny
dried
petals
rustled
out
of
the
meshes
for
miss
ainslie
laces
were
laid
away
in
lavender
like
her
love
i
do
see
them
she
said
yes
here
they
she
gave
him
a
bundle
of
yellowed
letters
tied
with
lavender
ribbon
i
take
them
to
her
he
answered
picking
up
a
small
black
case
that
lay
on
the
floor
and
opening
it
why
ruth
he
gasped
it
my
picture
miss
ainslie
voice
rose
again
in
pitiful
cadence
carl
carl
dear
where
are
you
i
want
you
oh
i
want
you
he
hastened
to
her
leaving
the
picture
in
ruth
hand
it
was
an
ambrotype
set
into
a
case
lined
with
purple
velvet
the
face
was
that
of
a
young
man
not
more
than
or
thirty
who
looked
strangely
like
winfield
the
eyes
forehead
and
the
poise
of
the
head
were
the
same
the
earth
trembled
beneath
ruth
feet
for
a
moment
then
all
at
once
she
understood
the
light
in
the
attic
window
the
marked
paragraph
in
the
paper
and
the
death
notices
why
yes
the
charles
winfield
who
had
married
abigail
weatherby
was
miss
ainslie
lover
and
carl
was
his
son
he
went
away
miss
ainslie
voice
came
again
to
ruth
when
she
told
her
story
with
no
hint
of
her
lover
name
he
went
away
and
soon
afterward
married
abigail
weatherby
but
why
was
it
love
at
first
sight
or
did
he
believe
that
his
sweetheart
was
dead
then
carl
was
born
and
the
mother
died
twelve
years
afterward
he
followed
her
broken
hearted
carl
had
told
her
that
his
father
could
not
bear
the
smell
of
lavender
nor
the
sight
of
any
shade
of
purple
and
miss
ainslie
always
wore
lavender
and
lived
in
the
scent
of
it
had
he
come
to
shrink
from
it
through
remorse
why
was
it
she
wondered
had
he
forgotten
miss
ainslie
or
had
he
been
suddenly
swept
off
his
feet
by
some
blind
whirlwind
of
passion
in
either
case
memory
had
returned
to
torture
him
a
thousand
fold
to
make
him
ashamed
to
face
her
with
his
boy
in
his
arms
and
aunt
jane
knew
of
the
marriage
at
the
time
probably
and
said
no
word
then
she
learned
of
abigail
weatherby
death
and
was
still
silent
hoping
perhaps
that
the
wanderer
would
come
back
until
she
learned
that
charles
winfield
too
was
dead
and
still
she
had
not
told
miss
ainslie
or
possibly
thought
she
knew
it
all
till
the
day
that
hepsey
had
spoken
of
when
she
came
home
looking
strange
to
keep
the
light
in
the
attic
window
every
night
for
more
than
five
years
was
it
kind
ruth
doubted
for
a
moment
then
her
heart
softened
with
love
for
aunt
jane
who
had
hidden
the
knowledge
that
would
be
a
death
blow
to
miss
ainslie
and
let
her
live
on
happy
in
her
dream
while
the
stern
puritan
conscience
made
her
keep
the
light
in
the
attic
window
in
fulfilment
of
her
promise
as
if
the
little
light
could
reach
the
veil
which
hangs
between
us
and
eternity
or
penetrate
the
greyness
which
never
parts
save
for
a
passage
as
if
all
miss
ainslie
love
and
faith
could
bring
the
dead
to
life
again
even
to
be
forgiven
her
lips
quivered
when
she
thought
of
miss
ainslie
tenderness
for
carl
and
the
little
whispered
lullabies
that
she
sang
to
herself
over
and
over
again
she
does
not
know
thought
ruth
thank
god
she
will
never
know
she
put
the
rest
of
the
things
into
the
chest
and
closed
it
covering
it
as
before
with
the
rug
miss
ainslie
loved
when
she
went
into
the
other
room
she
was
asleep
again
with
her
cheek
pillowed
on
the
letters
while
carl
sat
beside
her
holding
her
hand
and
pondering
over
the
mystery
he
could
not
explain
ruth
heart
ached
for
those
two
so
strangely
brought
together
who
had
but
this
little
hour
to
atone
for
a
lifetime
of
loss
the
first
faint
lines
of
light
came
into
the
eastern
sky
ruth
stood
by
the
window
watching
the
colour
come
on
the
grey
above
the
hill
while
two
or
three
stars
still
shone
dimly
the
night
lamp
flickered
then
went
out
she
set
it
in
the
hall
and
came
back
to
the
window
as
miss
ainslie
rug
had
been
woven
little
by
little
purple
crimson
and
turquoise
gleaming
with
inward
fires
shone
upon
the
clouds
carl
came
over
to
ruth
putting
his
arm
around
her
they
watched
it
together
that
miracle
which
is
as
old
as
the
world
and
yet
ever
new
i
do
see
he
began
hush
dear
ruth
whispered
i
know
and
i
tell
you
some
time
but
i
do
want
her
to
the
sky
brightened
slowly
and
the
intense
colour
came
into
the
room
with
the
light
ruth
drew
the
curtains
aside
saying
in
a
low
tone
it
beautiful
is
it
there
was
a
sudden
movement
in
the
room
and
they
turned
to
see
miss
ainslie
sitting
up
her
cheeks
flushed
and
the
letters
scattered
around
her
the
ribbon
had
slipped
away
and
her
heavy
white
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
ruth
went
to
her
to
tie
it
back
again
but
she
put
her
away
very
gently
without
speaking
carl
stood
by
the
window
thinking
and
miss
ainslie
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
wonder
and
love
the
sunrise
stained
her
white
face
and
her
eyes
shone
brightly
as
sapphires
touched
with
dawn
the
first
ray
of
the
sun
came
into
the
little
room
and
lay
upon
her
hair
changing
its
whiteness
to
gleaming
silver
then
all
at
once
her
face
illumined
as
from
a
light
within
carl
moved
away
from
the
window
strangely
drawn
toward
her
and
her
face
became
radiant
with
unspeakable
joy
then
the
passion
of
her
denied
motherhood
swelled
into
a
cry
of
longing
my
son
mother
broke
from
his
lips
in
answer
he
went
to
her
blindly
knowing
only
that
they
belonged
to
each
other
and
that
in
some
inscrutable
way
they
had
been
kept
apart
until
it
was
too
late
he
took
her
into
his
arms
holding
her
close
and
whispering
brokenly
what
only
she
and
god
might
hear
ruth
turned
away
sobbing
as
if
it
was
something
too
holy
for
her
to
see
miss
ainslie
transfigured
with
unearthly
light
lifted
her
face
to
his
her
lips
quivered
for
an
instant
then
grew
cold
beneath
his
own
she
sank
back
among
the
pillows
with
her
eyes
closed
but
with
yet
another
glory
upon
the
marble
whiteness
of
her
face
as
though
at
the
end
of
her
journey
and
beyond
the
mists
that
divided
them
her
dream
had
become
divinely
true
then
he
who
should
have
been
her
son
bent
down
the
tears
falling
unheeded
upon
her
face
and
kissed
her
again
