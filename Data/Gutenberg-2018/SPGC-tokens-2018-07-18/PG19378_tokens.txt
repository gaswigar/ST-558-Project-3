introduction
early
in
the
year
i
was
a
candidate
for
one
of
two
vacancies
in
the
consular
service
for
turkey
persia
and
the
levant
but
failed
to
gain
the
necessary
place
in
the
competitive
examination
i
was
in
despair
all
my
hopes
for
months
had
been
turned
towards
sunny
countries
and
old
civilisations
away
from
the
drab
monotone
of
london
fog
which
seemed
a
nightmare
when
the
prospect
of
escape
eluded
me
i
was
eighteen
years
old
and
having
failed
in
one
or
two
adventures
i
thought
myself
an
failure
and
was
much
depressed
i
dreamed
of
eastern
sunshine
palm
trees
camels
desert
sand
as
of
a
paradise
which
i
had
lost
by
my
shortcomings
what
was
my
rapture
when
my
mother
one
fine
day
suggested
that
it
might
be
good
for
me
to
travel
in
the
east
because
my
longing
for
it
seemed
to
indicate
a
natural
instinct
with
which
she
herself
possessing
eastern
memories
was
in
full
sympathy
i
fancy
there
was
some
idea
at
the
time
that
if
i
learnt
the
languages
and
studied
life
upon
the
spot
i
might
eventually
find
some
backstairs
way
into
the
service
of
the
foreign
office
but
that
idea
though
cherished
by
my
elders
as
some
excuse
for
the
expenses
of
my
expedition
had
never
from
the
first
appealed
to
me
and
from
the
moment
when
i
got
to
egypt
my
first
destination
it
lost
whatever
lustre
it
had
had
at
home
for
then
the
european
ceased
to
interest
me
appearing
somehow
inappropriate
and
false
in
those
surroundings
at
first
i
tried
to
overcome
this
feeling
or
perception
which
while
i
lived
with
english
people
seemed
unlawful
all
my
education
until
then
had
tended
to
impose
on
me
the
cult
of
the
thing
done
habitually
upon
a
certain
plane
of
our
society
to
seek
to
mix
on
an
equality
with
orientals
of
whatever
breeding
was
one
of
those
things
which
were
never
done
nor
even
contemplated
by
the
kind
of
person
who
had
always
been
my
model
my
sneaking
wish
to
know
the
natives
of
the
country
intimately
like
other
unconventional
desires
i
had
at
times
experienced
might
have
remained
a
sneaking
wish
until
this
day
but
for
an
accident
which
freed
me
for
a
time
from
english
supervision
my
people
had
provided
me
with
introductions
to
several
influential
english
residents
in
syria
among
others
to
a
family
of
good
position
in
jerusalem
and
it
was
understood
that
on
arrival
in
that
country
i
should
go
directly
to
that
family
for
information
and
advice
but
as
it
chanced
on
board
the
ship
which
took
me
to
port
said
from
naples
i
met
a
man
who
knew
those
people
intimately
had
been
indeed
for
years
an
inmate
of
their
house
and
he
assumed
the
office
of
my
mentor
i
stayed
in
cairo
merely
because
he
did
for
some
weeks
and
went
with
him
on
the
same
boat
to
jaffa
he
for
some
unknown
reason
i
suspect
insanity
did
not
want
me
in
jerusalem
just
then
and
when
we
landed
spun
me
a
strange
yarn
of
how
the
people
i
had
thought
to
visit
were
exceedingly
eccentric
and
uncertain
in
their
moods
and
how
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
stop
in
jaffa
until
he
sent
me
word
that
i
was
sure
of
welcome
his
story
was
entirely
false
i
found
out
later
a
libel
on
a
very
hospitable
house
but
i
believed
it
at
the
time
as
i
did
all
his
statements
having
no
other
means
of
information
on
the
subject
so
i
remained
at
jaffa
in
a
little
in
the
german
colony
which
had
the
charms
of
cleanliness
and
cheapness
and
there
i
might
have
stayed
till
now
had
i
awaited
the
tidings
promised
by
my
counsellor
there
for
the
first
two
weeks
i
found
life
very
dull
then
hanauer
the
english
chaplain
and
a
famous
antiquarian
took
pity
on
my
solitary
state
walked
me
about
and
taught
me
words
of
arabic
he
was
a
native
of
jerusalem
and
loved
the
country
my
sneaking
wish
to
fraternise
with
orientals
when
i
avowed
it
after
hesitations
appeared
good
to
him
and
then
i
made
acquaintance
with
a
clever
dragoman
and
one
of
the
most
famous
jokers
in
all
syria
who
happened
to
be
lodging
at
my
little
hostelry
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
stare
about
him
he
helped
me
to
throw
off
the
european
and
plunge
into
the
native
way
of
living
with
him
i
rode
about
the
plain
of
sharon
sojourning
among
the
fellâhîn
and
sitting
in
the
of
ramleh
lydda
gaza
meeting
all
sorts
of
people
and
acquiring
the
vernacular
without
an
effort
in
the
manner
of
amusement
from
dawn
to
sunset
we
were
in
the
saddle
we
went
on
pilgrimage
to
nebi
rubîn
the
mosque
upon
the
edge
of
marshes
by
the
sea
to
gaza
we
rode
up
northward
to
the
foot
of
carmel
explored
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
of
judæa
frequented
turkish
baths
ate
native
meals
and
slept
in
native
houses
following
the
customs
of
the
people
of
the
land
in
all
respects
and
i
was
amazed
at
the
immense
relief
i
found
in
such
a
life
in
all
my
previous
years
i
had
not
seen
happy
people
these
were
happy
poor
they
might
be
but
they
had
no
dream
of
wealth
the
very
thought
of
competition
was
unknown
to
them
and
rivalry
was
still
a
matter
of
the
horse
and
spear
wages
and
rent
were
troubles
they
had
never
heard
of
class
distinctions
as
we
understand
them
were
not
everybody
talked
to
everybody
with
inequality
they
had
a
true
fraternity
people
complained
that
they
were
badly
governed
which
merely
meant
that
they
were
left
to
their
devices
save
on
great
occasions
a
government
which
touches
every
individual
and
interferes
with
him
to
some
extent
in
daily
life
though
much
esteemed
by
europeans
seems
intolerable
to
the
oriental
i
had
a
vision
of
the
tortured
peoples
of
the
earth
impelled
by
their
own
misery
to
desolate
the
happy
peoples
a
vision
which
grew
clearer
in
the
after
years
but
in
that
eastern
life
there
is
a
power
of
resistance
as
everybody
knows
who
tries
to
change
it
which
may
yet
defeat
the
hosts
of
joyless
drudgery
my
syrian
friend
the
suleymân
of
the
following
sketches
introduced
me
to
the
only
europeans
who
espoused
that
life
a
french
alsatian
family
the
baldenspergers
renowned
as
pioneers
of
scientific
in
palestine
who
hospitably
took
a
share
in
my
initiation
they
had
innumerable
hives
in
different
parts
of
the
country
i
have
seen
them
near
the
jaffa
gardens
and
among
the
mountains
south
of
hebron
which
they
transported
in
due
season
on
the
backs
of
camels
seeking
a
new
growth
of
flowers
for
a
long
while
the
government
ignored
their
industry
until
the
rumour
grew
that
it
was
very
profitable
then
a
high
tax
was
imposed
the
baldenspergers
would
not
pay
it
they
said
the
government
might
take
the
hives
if
it
desired
to
do
so
soldiers
were
sent
to
carry
out
the
seizure
but
the
had
taken
out
the
bottom
of
each
hive
and
when
the
soldiers
lifted
them
out
swarmed
the
angry
bees
the
soldiers
fled
and
after
that
experience
the
government
agreed
to
compromise
i
remember
well
a
long
day
ride
with
emile
and
samuel
baldensperger
round
by
askelon
and
ekron
and
the
luncheon
which
a
village
headman
had
prepared
for
us
consisting
of
a
whole
sheep
roast
and
stuffed
with
nuts
and
vegetables
and
a
day
with
henri
baldensperger
in
the
hebron
region
the
friendships
of
those
days
were
made
for
life
hanauer
the
baldenspergers
suleymân
and
other
natives
of
the
country
those
of
them
who
are
alive
remain
my
friends
in
short
i
ran
completely
wild
for
months
in
a
manner
unbecoming
to
an
englishman
and
when
at
length
upon
a
pressing
invitation
i
turned
up
in
jerusalem
and
used
my
introductions
it
was
in
garb
and
with
a
love
for
arabs
which
i
was
made
to
understand
was
hardly
decent
my
native
friends
were
objects
of
suspicion
i
was
told
that
they
were
undesirable
and
when
i
stood
up
for
them
was
soon
put
down
by
the
retort
that
i
was
very
young
i
could
not
obviously
claim
as
much
experience
as
my
mature
advisers
whose
frequent
warnings
to
me
to
distrust
the
people
of
the
country
thus
acquired
the
force
of
moral
precepts
which
it
is
the
secret
joy
of
youth
to
disobey
that
is
the
reason
why
the
respectable
english
residents
in
syria
figure
in
these
pages
as
censorious
and
hostile
with
but
few
exceptions
they
were
hostile
to
my
point
of
view
which
was
not
then
avowed
but
not
to
me
indeed
so
many
of
them
showed
me
kindness
particularly
in
my
times
of
illness
that
i
can
not
think
of
them
without
a
glow
of
friendliness
but
the
attitude
of
most
of
them
was
never
mine
and
the
fact
that
at
the
time
i
still
admired
that
attitude
as
the
correct
one
and
thought
myself
at
intervals
a
sad
backslider
made
it
seem
forbidding
in
my
oriental
life
they
really
were
as
here
depicted
a
disapproving
shadow
in
the
background
with
one
referred
to
often
in
these
tales
i
was
in
full
agreement
we
lived
together
for
some
months
in
a
small
mountain
village
and
our
friendship
then
established
has
remained
unbroken
but
he
though
not
alone
was
an
exception
owing
to
the
general
verdict
on
my
arab
friends
i
led
what
might
be
called
a
double
life
during
the
months
of
my
first
sojourn
in
jerusalem
until
suleymân
the
tourist
season
being
ended
came
with
promise
of
adventure
when
i
flung
discretion
to
the
winds
we
hired
two
horses
and
a
muleteer
and
rode
away
into
the
north
together
a
fortnight
later
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
of
tyre
suleymân
was
forced
to
leave
me
being
summoned
to
his
village
i
still
rode
on
towards
the
north
alone
with
one
hired
muleteer
a
simple
soul
a
notion
of
my
subsequent
adventures
may
perhaps
be
gathered
from
the
following
pages
in
which
i
have
embodied
fictionally
some
impressions
still
remaining
clear
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
twenty
years
a
record
of
small
things
no
doubt
yet
it
seems
possible
that
something
human
may
be
learnt
from
such
a
comic
of
experience
which
would
never
be
derived
from
more
imposing
works
chapter
i
rashîd
the
fair
the
brown
plain
swimming
in
a
haze
of
heat
stretched
far
away
into
the
distance
where
a
chain
of
mountains
trenched
upon
the
cloudless
sky
six
months
of
drought
had
withered
all
the
herbage
only
thistles
blue
and
yellow
and
some
thorny
bushes
had
survived
but
after
the
torrential
winter
rains
the
whole
expanse
would
blossom
like
the
rose
i
traversed
the
plain
afterwards
in
spring
when
cornfields
waved
for
miles
around
its
three
mud
villages
wild
flowers
in
mad
profusion
covered
its
waste
places
and
scarlet
tulips
flamed
amid
its
wheat
now
all
was
desert
after
riding
for
four
days
in
such
a
landscape
it
was
sweet
to
think
upon
the
journey
end
the
city
of
perennial
waters
shady
gardens
and
the
song
of
birds
i
was
picturing
the
scene
of
our
arrival
the
shade
and
the
repose
the
long
cool
drinks
the
friendly
hum
of
the
bazaars
and
wondering
what
letters
i
should
find
awaiting
me
all
to
the
tune
of
christian
soldiers
for
the
of
a
horse
hoofs
invariably
beats
out
in
my
brain
some
tune
the
most
incongruous
against
my
will
when
a
sudden
outcry
roused
me
it
came
from
my
companion
a
hired
muleteer
and
sounded
angry
the
fellow
had
been
riding
on
ahead
i
now
saw
that
he
had
overtaken
other
travellers
two
men
astride
of
one
donkey
and
had
entered
into
conversation
with
them
one
of
the
two
the
hindmost
was
a
turkish
soldier
except
the
little
group
they
made
together
and
a
vulture
a
mere
speck
above
them
in
the
blue
no
other
living
creature
was
in
sight
something
had
happened
for
the
soldier
seemed
amused
while
my
poor
man
was
making
gestures
of
despairing
protest
he
repeated
the
loud
cry
which
had
disturbed
my
reverie
then
turned
his
mule
and
hurried
back
to
meet
me
knife
he
bellowed
knife
that
grand
steel
blade
which
was
my
honour
so
finely
tempered
and
inlaid
an
heirloom
in
the
family
that
miscreant
may
allah
cut
his
life
i
mean
the
soldier
stole
it
he
asked
to
look
at
it
a
minute
seeming
to
admire
i
gave
it
like
the
innocent
i
am
he
stuck
it
in
his
belt
and
asked
to
see
the
passport
which
permitted
me
to
carry
weapons
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
this
wild
region
he
will
not
give
it
back
though
i
entreated
i
am
your
honour
servant
speak
for
me
and
make
him
give
it
back
it
is
an
heirloom
that
man
was
crying
like
a
baby
now
i
was
very
young
and
his
implicit
trust
in
my
authority
enthralled
me
i
valued
his
dependence
on
my
manhood
more
than
gold
and
precious
stones
summoning
all
the
courage
i
possessed
i
clapped
spurs
to
my
horse
and
galloped
after
the
marauder
back
that
knife
i
roared
soldier
it
is
thou
to
whom
i
speak
the
soldier
turned
a
studiously
guileless
face
a
handsome
face
with
fair
moustache
and
a
week
beard
he
had
a
roguish
eye
knife
i
do
not
understand
he
said
indulgently
knife
thou
stolest
from
the
muleteer
here
present
that
replied
the
soldier
with
a
deprecating
laugh
is
a
thing
unworthy
of
your
honour
notice
the
rogue
in
question
is
a
malefactor
he
and
i
are
old
acquaintance
the
beard
of
the
prophet
by
the
august
coran
i
never
saw
his
devil
face
until
this
minute
bawled
the
muleteer
who
had
come
up
behind
me
back
the
knife
i
ordered
for
the
second
time
allah
never
was
the
cool
reply
it
back
i
say
it
can
not
be
not
even
to
oblige
your
honour
for
whose
pleasure
allah
knows
i
would
do
almost
anything
murmured
the
soldier
with
a
charming
smile
it
not
be
pleased
to
understand
that
if
it
were
your
honour
knife
i
would
return
it
instantly
but
that
man
as
i
tell
thee
is
a
wretch
it
grieves
me
to
behold
a
person
of
consideration
in
such
an
unbecoming
temper
upon
his
account
a
dog
no
more
he
is
a
dog
he
is
my
dog
for
the
present
so
give
back
the
knife
beloved
that
is
quite
impossible
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
dismissing
the
whole
subject
the
soldier
turned
away
he
plucked
a
cigarette
out
of
his
girdle
and
prepared
to
light
it
his
companion
on
the
donkey
had
not
turned
his
head
nor
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
the
discussion
this
had
lasted
long
enough
i
knew
that
in
another
minute
i
should
have
to
laugh
if
anything
remained
for
me
to
do
it
must
be
done
immediately
whipping
my
revolver
from
the
holster
i
held
it
close
against
the
head
yelling
back
the
knife
this
minute
or
i
kill
thee
the
man
went
limp
the
knife
came
back
as
quick
as
lightning
i
gave
it
to
the
muleteer
who
blubbered
praise
to
allah
and
made
off
with
it
equally
relieved
i
was
about
to
follow
when
the
utterly
forlorn
appearance
of
the
soldier
moved
me
to
open
the
revolver
showing
that
it
was
not
loaded
then
my
adversary
was
transfigured
his
back
straightened
his
mouth
closed
his
eyes
regained
their
old
intelligence
he
stared
at
me
a
moment
half
incredulous
and
then
he
laughed
ah
how
that
soldier
laughed
the
owner
of
the
donkey
turned
and
shared
his
glee
they
literally
hugged
each
other
roaring
with
delight
while
the
donkey
underneath
them
both
jogged
dutifully
on
before
a
caravanserai
in
a
small
valley
green
with
beside
a
slender
stream
whose
banks
were
fringed
with
oleander
i
was
sitting
waiting
for
some
luncheon
when
the
donkey
and
its
riders
came
again
in
sight
the
soldier
tumbled
off
on
spying
me
and
ran
into
the
inn
like
one
possessed
a
minute
later
he
brought
out
the
food
which
i
had
ordered
and
set
the
table
for
me
in
the
shade
of
trees
would
not
let
another
serve
thee
he
informed
me
the
love
of
that
vile
joke
that
thou
didst
put
upon
me
it
was
not
loaded
after
all
my
fright
it
is
a
nice
revolver
let
me
look
at
it
look
thy
fill
thou
shalt
not
touch
it
was
my
answer
at
which
he
laughed
anew
pronouncing
me
the
merriest
of
adam
race
tell
me
what
wouldst
thou
have
done
had
i
refused
it
was
not
loaded
what
wouldst
thou
have
done
his
hand
was
resting
at
that
moment
on
a
stool
i
rapped
his
knuckles
gently
with
the
butt
of
the
revolver
to
let
him
know
its
weight
he
cried
out
in
admiration
believe
thou
wouldst
have
smashed
my
head
with
it
all
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
man
of
no
account
whom
thou
employest
for
a
week
and
after
that
wilt
see
no
more
efendim
take
me
as
thy
servant
always
of
a
sudden
he
spoke
very
earnestly
the
money
to
release
me
from
the
army
it
is
a
largeish
sum
five
turkish
pounds
and
allah
knows
i
will
repay
it
to
thee
by
my
service
for
the
love
of
righteousness
accept
me
for
my
soul
is
thine
i
ridiculed
the
notion
he
persisted
when
the
muleteer
and
i
set
forth
again
he
rode
beside
us
mounted
on
another
donkey
this
time
as
he
put
it
which
showed
he
was
a
person
of
resource
allah
i
can
shoe
a
horse
and
cook
a
fowl
i
can
mend
garments
with
a
thread
and
shoot
a
bird
upon
the
wing
he
told
me
would
take
care
of
the
stable
and
the
house
i
would
do
everything
your
honour
wanted
my
nickname
is
rashîd
the
fair
my
garrison
is
karameyn
just
two
days
journey
from
the
city
come
in
a
day
or
two
and
buy
me
out
no
matter
for
the
wages
only
try
me
at
the
khan
a
pretty
rough
one
where
we
spent
the
night
he
waited
on
me
deftly
and
enforced
respect
making
me
really
wish
for
such
a
servant
on
the
morrow
after
an
hour
riding
our
ways
parted
i
shall
see
thee
before
many
days
he
murmured
nickname
is
rashîd
the
fair
forget
not
i
shall
tell
our
captain
thou
art
coming
with
the
money
i
said
that
i
might
think
about
it
possibly
he
entreated
wouldst
never
shame
a
man
who
puts
his
trust
in
thee
i
say
that
i
shall
tell
our
captain
thou
art
coming
ah
shame
me
not
before
the
commandant
and
all
my
comrades
thou
thinkest
me
a
thief
a
lawbreaker
because
i
took
that
knife
he
asked
with
an
indulgent
smile
me
tell
thee
o
my
lord
that
i
was
in
my
right
and
duty
as
a
soldier
of
the
sultan
in
this
province
it
is
that
muleteer
who
truly
speaking
breaks
the
law
by
carrying
the
knife
without
a
permit
and
thou
hast
thou
a
passport
for
that
fine
revolver
at
the
place
where
we
had
luncheon
yesterday
were
other
soldiers
by
merely
calling
on
them
to
support
me
i
could
have
had
his
knife
and
thy
revolver
with
ease
and
honesty
in
strict
accordance
with
the
law
why
did
i
not
do
so
because
i
love
thee
say
thou
wilt
come
to
karameyn
and
buy
me
out
i
watched
him
jogging
on
his
donkey
towards
a
gulley
of
the
hills
along
which
lay
the
to
karameyn
on
all
the
evidence
he
was
a
rogue
and
yet
my
intimate
conviction
was
that
he
was
honest
all
the
europeans
in
the
land
would
lift
up
hands
of
horror
and
exclaim
on
hearing
such
a
story
yet
as
i
rode
across
the
parched
brown
land
towards
the
city
of
green
trees
and
rushing
waters
i
knew
that
i
should
go
to
karameyn
chapter
ii
a
mountain
garrison
the
long
day
ride
was
uneventful
but
not
so
the
night
i
spent
it
in
a
village
of
the
mountains
at
a
very
curious
hostelry
kept
by
a
fat
native
christian
named
elias
who
laid
claim
upon
the
signboard
to
furnish
food
and
lodging
that
is
in
the
modern
european
manner
there
was
one
large
and
an
adjoining
bedroom
of
the
same
dimensions
for
some
thirty
travellers
i
had
to
find
a
stable
for
my
horse
elsewhere
a
was
provided
and
we
sat
on
chairs
around
it
but
the
food
was
no
wise
european
and
the
cooking
was
degraded
greek
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
were
laid
for
every
guest
but
several
cast
these
on
the
floor
and
used
their
fingers
in
the
long
bedroom
were
a
dozen
beds
on
bedsteads
by
offering
a
trifle
extra
i
secured
one
to
myself
in
others
there
were
two
three
even
four
together
an
elderly
armenian
gentleman
who
had
a
wife
with
him
stood
guard
with
pistols
over
her
all
night
he
was
so
foolish
as
to
threaten
loudly
anyone
who
dared
approach
her
after
he
had
done
so
several
times
a
man
arose
from
the
bed
next
to
mine
and
strolling
to
him
seized
him
by
the
throat
man
he
chided
thou
mad
or
what
thus
to
arouse
our
passions
by
thy
talk
of
women
be
silent
or
we
honest
men
here
present
will
wring
thy
neck
and
take
thy
woman
from
thee
dost
thou
understand
he
shook
that
jealous
husband
as
a
terrier
would
shake
a
rat
silent
hearest
thou
men
wish
to
sleep
i
not
well
o
brother
said
the
monitor
to
me
as
he
got
back
to
bed
allah
well
was
my
reply
the
jealous
one
was
silent
after
that
but
there
were
other
noises
some
men
still
lingered
in
the
playing
cards
the
host
devoted
to
things
european
had
a
it
was
happily
before
the
day
of
gramophones
which
the
kept
going
all
night
long
i
had
a
touch
of
fever
there
were
insects
sleep
was
hopeless
i
rose
while
it
was
yet
night
went
out
without
paying
since
the
host
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
in
some
danger
from
the
fierce
attacks
of
pariah
dogs
found
out
the
vault
in
which
my
horse
was
stabled
ten
minutes
later
i
was
clear
of
the
village
riding
along
a
mountain
side
but
dimly
visible
beneath
the
stars
the
path
descended
to
a
deep
ravine
and
rose
again
up
up
interminably
at
length
upon
the
summit
of
a
ridge
i
felt
the
dawn
the
mountain
tops
were
whitened
like
the
crests
of
waves
while
all
the
clefts
and
hollows
remained
full
of
night
behind
me
in
the
east
there
was
a
long
white
streak
making
the
mountain
outlines
bleak
and
keen
the
stars
looked
strange
a
fresh
breeze
fanned
my
cheek
and
rustled
in
the
grass
and
shrubs
before
me
on
an
isolated
bluff
appeared
my
destination
a
large
village
like
a
fortress
its
buildings
presently
took
on
a
blush
which
deepened
to
the
red
of
fire
a
splendid
sight
against
a
dark
blue
sky
still
full
of
stars
a
window
flashed
up
there
the
sun
had
risen
some
english
people
when
informed
of
my
intention
to
buy
a
man
out
of
the
turkish
army
had
pronounced
it
madness
i
did
not
know
the
people
of
the
land
as
they
did
i
should
be
pillaged
brought
to
destitution
perhaps
murdered
they
who
had
lived
in
the
country
twenty
thirty
years
were
better
qualified
to
judge
than
i
was
for
peace
and
quiet
i
pretended
acquiescence
and
my
purpose
thus
acquired
a
taste
of
stealth
it
was
with
the
feelings
of
a
kind
of
truant
that
i
had
set
out
at
length
without
a
word
to
anyone
and
with
the
same
adventurous
feelings
that
i
now
drew
near
to
karameyn
two
soldiers
basking
in
the
sunshine
on
a
sprang
up
at
my
approach
one
was
the
man
i
sought
the
rogue
rashîd
they
led
me
to
their
captain
house
a
modest
dwelling
consisting
of
a
single
room
with
hardly
any
furniture
a
score
of
soldiers
followed
after
us
the
captain
hasan
agha
an
old
man
with
face
scarred
and
heavy
white
moustache
was
in
full
uniform
and
as
i
entered
was
engaged
in
putting
on
a
pair
of
cotton
gloves
he
was
one
of
the
old
turkish
officers
those
whose
whole
knowledge
of
their
business
was
derived
from
service
in
a
regiment
or
instead
of
from
instruction
at
a
military
school
and
his
manner
towards
the
men
had
nothing
of
the
martinet
he
addressed
them
as
children
with
affection
and
they
though
quite
respectful
conversed
freely
in
his
presence
hasan
agha
paid
me
many
compliments
and
repeatedly
inquired
after
my
health
he
would
not
hear
about
my
business
till
i
had
had
breakfast
luncheon
had
been
arranged
for
me
he
said
but
that
could
not
be
ready
for
some
hours
would
i
be
so
kind
as
to
excuse
a
makeshift
even
as
he
spoke
a
soldier
entered
with
a
tray
on
which
were
slabs
of
arab
bread
a
pitcher
of
sour
milk
and
heaps
of
grapes
another
soldier
began
pounding
coffee
while
yet
another
blew
upon
the
charcoal
in
a
brazier
i
refused
to
eat
unless
my
host
ate
with
me
which
he
did
only
after
much
polite
resistance
after
the
meal
we
sat
and
talked
the
soldiers
joining
in
the
conversation
they
told
me
of
old
wars
and
deeds
of
valour
hasan
agha
was
it
seemed
a
famous
fighter
and
the
men
did
all
they
could
to
make
him
tell
me
of
his
battles
they
brought
an
old
man
in
out
of
the
town
to
see
me
because
he
had
fought
in
the
crimean
war
and
knew
the
english
before
it
grew
too
hot
they
took
me
out
to
see
the
barracks
and
a
ramshackle
old
fieldpiece
which
they
seemed
to
idolise
then
followed
luncheon
with
its
long
array
of
arab
dishes
of
which
the
soldiers
had
their
share
eventually
rashîd
assured
me
afterwards
that
all
the
food
on
this
occasion
had
been
that
was
in
abdul
hamid
golden
days
after
luncheon
there
was
coffee
with
more
compliments
and
then
at
last
we
got
to
business
a
public
writer
was
brought
in
he
wrote
out
a
receipt
for
me
and
also
the
discharge
rashîd
required
hasan
agha
stamped
both
documents
with
an
official
seal
and
handed
them
to
me
who
gave
him
in
exchange
the
money
he
exclaimed
call
all
here
to
witness
that
rashîd
the
son
of
ali
called
the
fair
is
free
henceforth
to
go
what
way
he
chooses
to
me
he
said
is
a
good
lad
and
you
will
find
him
useful
the
chief
fault
i
have
found
in
him
is
this
that
when
obeying
orders
he
is
apt
to
think
and
so
invent
a
method
of
his
own
not
always
good
also
he
is
too
susceptible
to
female
charms
a
failing
which
has
placed
him
in
some
strange
positions
the
last
remark
evoked
much
laughter
relating
evidently
to
some
standing
joke
unknown
to
me
rashîd
looked
rather
sheepish
hasan
agha
turned
to
him
and
said
son
praise
allah
for
thy
great
good
fortune
in
finding
favour
in
the
sight
of
one
so
noble
and
benevolent
as
our
beloved
guest
who
is
henceforth
thy
master
remember
he
is
not
as
i
am
one
who
has
been
what
thou
art
and
so
knows
the
tricks
serve
him
freely
with
thy
mind
and
soul
and
conscience
not
waiting
for
commands
as
in
the
army
come
hither
o
my
son
grasp
hands
with
me
i
say
may
god
be
with
thee
now
and
always
forget
not
all
the
good
instruction
of
thy
soldier
days
be
sure
that
we
shall
pray
for
thy
good
master
and
for
thee
the
old
man
eyes
were
wet
so
were
rashîd
so
were
the
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
squatting
round
rashîd
dismissed
went
off
to
change
his
uniform
for
an
old
suit
of
mine
which
i
had
brought
for
him
while
hasan
agha
talking
of
him
as
a
father
might
explained
to
me
his
character
and
little
failings
at
last
i
took
my
leave
rashîd
was
waiting
in
my
clothes
a
new
fez
of
civilian
shape
upon
his
head
he
held
my
stirrup
and
then
jumped
on
to
a
beast
which
had
been
for
him
by
his
friends
so
he
informed
me
it
might
be
worth
my
while
to
buy
it
for
him
he
suggested
later
the
price
was
only
eight
pounds
turk
the
merest
trifle
the
whole
garrison
escorted
us
to
the
last
houses
where
they
stood
a
long
while
waving
their
farewells
two
hours
later
on
the
beyond
the
wady
we
turned
to
look
our
last
on
karameyn
it
stood
amid
the
flames
of
sunset
like
a
castle
of
the
clouds
we
returned
then
to
the
hostelry
but
rashîd
having
heard
the
story
of
my
sleepless
night
would
not
allow
me
to
put
up
there
i
paid
my
debt
to
the
proprietor
and
then
he
found
for
me
an
empty
house
to
which
he
brought
a
mattress
and
a
coverlet
a
lot
of
cushions
a
brazier
and
the
things
required
for
making
coffee
also
a
tray
of
supper
all
of
them
borrowed
from
the
neighbouring
houses
i
might
be
pillaged
brought
to
destitution
and
eventually
murdered
by
him
as
my
friends
had
warned
me
at
least
the
operation
promised
to
be
comfortable
chapter
iii
the
rhinoceros
whip
is
the
whip
rashîd
cried
suddenly
turning
upon
me
in
the
gateway
of
the
khan
where
we
had
just
arrived
allah
it
is
not
with
me
i
must
have
left
it
in
the
carriage
rashîd
threw
down
the
saddlebags
our
customary
luggage
which
he
had
been
carrying
and
started
running
for
his
life
the
carriage
had
got
down
the
narrow
street
with
awnings
at
fierce
shout
of
o
my
uncle
we
have
left
our
whip
the
driver
turned
and
glanced
behind
him
but
instead
of
stopping
lashed
his
horses
to
a
gallop
rashîd
ran
even
faster
than
before
the
chase
receding
rapidly
soon
vanished
from
my
sight
twilight
was
coming
on
above
the
low
flat
roofs
to
westward
the
crescent
moon
hung
in
the
green
of
sunset
behind
the
minarets
of
the
great
mosque
i
then
took
up
the
and
delicately
picked
my
way
through
couchant
camels
tethered
mules
and
horses
in
the
courtyard
to
the
khan
itself
which
was
a
kind
of
cloister
i
was
making
my
arrangements
with
the
landlord
when
rashîd
returned
the
picture
of
despair
he
flung
up
both
his
hands
announcing
failure
and
then
sank
down
upon
the
ground
and
moaned
the
host
a
burly
man
inquired
what
ailed
him
i
told
him
when
he
uttered
just
reflections
upon
cabmen
and
the
vanity
of
worldly
wealth
rashîd
as
i
could
see
was
a
prey
to
that
strange
mixture
of
mad
rage
and
sorrow
and
despair
which
is
a
real
disease
for
children
of
the
arabs
an
english
servant
would
not
thus
have
cared
about
the
loss
of
a
small
item
of
his
master
property
not
by
his
fault
but
through
that
master
oversight
but
my
possessions
were
rashîd
delight
his
claim
to
honour
he
boasted
of
them
to
all
comers
in
particular
did
he
revere
my
gun
my
service
revolver
and
this
whip
a
tough
thong
of
rhinoceros
hide
rather
nicely
mounted
with
silver
which
had
been
presented
to
me
by
an
aged
arab
in
return
for
some
imagined
favour
i
had
found
it
useful
against
pariah
dogs
when
these
rushed
out
in
packs
to
bite
horse
legs
but
had
never
viewed
it
as
a
badge
of
honour
till
rashîd
came
to
me
to
him
it
was
the
best
of
our
possessions
marking
us
as
of
rank
above
the
common
he
thrust
it
on
me
even
when
i
went
out
walking
and
he
it
was
who
when
we
started
from
our
mountain
home
at
noon
that
day
had
laid
it
reverently
down
upon
the
seat
beside
me
before
he
climbed
upon
the
box
beside
the
driver
and
now
the
whip
was
lost
through
my
neglectfulness
rashîd
dejection
made
me
feel
a
worm
allah
he
made
moan
can
i
do
the
driver
was
a
chance
encounter
i
do
not
know
his
dwelling
which
may
god
destroy
the
host
remarked
in
comfortable
tones
that
flesh
is
grass
all
treasure
perishable
and
that
it
behoves
a
man
to
fix
desire
on
higher
things
whereat
rashîd
sprang
up
as
one
past
patience
and
departed
darting
through
the
cattle
in
the
yard
with
almost
supernatural
agility
him
eat
his
rage
alone
the
host
advised
me
with
a
shrug
having
ordered
supper
for
the
third
hour
of
the
night
i
too
went
out
to
stretch
my
limbs
which
were
stiff
and
bruised
from
four
hours
jolting
in
a
springless
carriage
always
on
the
point
of
overturning
we
should
have
done
better
to
have
come
on
horseback
in
the
usual
way
but
rashîd
having
chanced
upon
the
carriage
a
great
rarity
had
decided
on
that
way
of
going
as
more
fashionable
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
a
road
the
stars
were
out
in
the
few
shops
which
still
kept
open
lanterns
hung
throwing
streaks
of
yellow
light
on
the
uneven
causeway
a
gleam
into
the
eyes
of
wayfarers
and
prowling
dogs
many
of
the
people
in
the
streets
too
carried
lanterns
whose
swing
made
objects
in
their
circle
seem
to
leap
and
fall
i
came
at
length
into
an
open
place
where
there
was
concourse
a
kind
of
square
which
might
be
called
the
centre
of
the
city
the
crowd
there
as
i
noticed
with
surprise
was
stationary
with
all
its
faces
turned
in
one
direction
i
heard
a
man
voice
weeping
and
declaiming
wildly
is
it
i
inquired
among
the
outskirts
great
misfortune
someone
answered
poor
servant
has
lost
a
whip
worth
fifty
turkish
pounds
his
master
property
it
was
stolen
from
him
by
a
miscreant
a
wicked
cabman
his
lord
will
kill
him
if
he
fails
to
find
it
seized
with
interest
i
shouldered
my
way
forward
there
was
rashîd
against
the
wall
of
a
large
mosque
beating
himself
against
that
wall
with
a
most
fearful
outcry
a
group
of
soldiers
the
policemen
of
the
city
hung
round
him
in
compassion
questioning
happily
i
wore
a
fez
and
so
was
inconspicuous
turkish
pounds
he
yelled
hundred
would
not
buy
its
brother
my
master
the
tremendous
count
of
all
the
english
their
chief
prince
by
allah
loves
it
as
his
soul
he
will
pluck
out
and
devour
my
heart
and
liver
o
high
protector
o
almighty
lord
like
was
this
said
cabman
asked
a
sergeant
of
the
watch
rashîd
with
sobs
and
many
pious
interjections
described
the
cabman
rather
neatly
as
man
of
a
form
as
if
inflated
in
the
lower
half
his
name
he
told
me
was
habîb
but
allah
knows
man
is
known
exclaimed
the
sergeant
eagerly
dwelling
is
close
by
come
o
thou
poor
one
we
will
take
the
whip
from
him
at
that
rashîd
grief
ceased
as
if
by
magic
he
took
the
hand
and
fondled
it
as
they
went
off
together
i
followed
with
the
crowd
as
far
as
to
the
cabman
door
a
filthy
entry
in
a
narrow
lane
where
wishing
to
avoid
discovery
i
broke
away
and
walked
back
quickly
to
the
khan
i
had
been
there
in
my
private
alcove
some
few
minutes
when
rashîd
arrived
with
a
triumphant
air
holding
on
high
the
famous
whip
the
sergeant
came
across
the
court
with
him
a
score
of
soldiers
waited
in
the
gateway
as
i
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
great
lantern
hanging
from
the
arch
be
to
allah
i
have
found
it
cried
rashîd
be
to
allah
we
have
been
enabled
to
do
a
little
service
for
your
highness
cried
the
sergeant
therewith
he
pounced
upon
my
hand
and
kissed
it
i
made
them
both
sit
down
and
called
for
coffee
between
the
two
of
them
i
heard
the
story
the
sergeant
praised
rashîd
intelligence
in
going
out
and
crying
in
a
public
place
until
the
city
and
its
whole
police
force
had
a
share
in
his
distress
rashîd
on
his
side
said
that
all
that
would
have
been
in
vain
but
for
the
sergeant
knowledge
of
the
cabman
house
the
sergeant
with
a
chuckle
owned
that
that
same
knowledge
would
have
been
of
no
effect
had
not
rashîd
once
more
displayed
his
keen
intelligence
they
had
poured
into
the
house
a
single
room
illumined
only
by
a
saucer
lamp
upon
the
ground
and
searched
it
thoroughly
the
cabman
all
the
while
protesting
his
great
innocence
and
swearing
he
had
never
in
this
world
beheld
a
whip
like
that
described
the
soldiers
finding
no
whip
were
beginning
to
believe
his
word
when
rashîd
who
had
remained
aloof
observing
that
the
cabman
wife
stood
very
still
beneath
her
veils
assailed
her
with
a
mighty
push
which
sent
her
staggering
across
the
room
the
whip
was
then
discovered
it
had
been
hidden
underneath
her
petticoats
they
had
given
the
delinquent
a
good
beating
then
and
there
would
that
be
punishment
enough
in
my
opinion
asked
the
sergeant
we
decided
that
the
beating
was
enough
i
gave
the
sergeant
a
small
present
when
he
left
rashîd
went
with
him
after
carefully
concealing
the
now
famous
whip
i
suppose
they
went
off
to
some
tavern
to
discuss
the
wonderful
adventure
more
at
length
for
i
supped
alone
and
had
been
some
time
stretched
upon
my
mattress
on
the
floor
before
rashîd
came
in
and
spread
his
bed
beside
me
thou
awake
o
my
dear
lord
he
whispered
allah
thou
didst
wrong
to
give
that
sergeant
any
money
i
had
made
thy
name
so
great
that
but
to
look
on
thee
was
fee
sufficient
for
a
poor
lean
dog
like
him
he
then
was
silent
for
so
long
a
while
that
i
imagined
he
had
gone
to
sleep
but
suddenly
he
whispered
once
again
my
dear
lord
forgive
me
the
disturbance
but
hast
thou
our
revolver
safe
allah
yes
here
ready
to
my
hand
but
it
would
be
better
for
the
future
that
i
should
bear
our
whip
and
our
revolver
i
have
made
thy
name
so
great
that
thou
shouldst
carry
nothing
chapter
iv
the
courteous
judge
we
were
giving
a
on
that
day
to
half
a
dozen
turkish
officers
and
when
he
brought
me
in
my
cup
of
tea
at
rashîd
informed
me
that
our
cook
had
been
arrested
the
said
cook
was
a
decent
muslim
but
and
something
of
a
blood
in
private
life
at
six
as
he
stood
basking
in
the
sunlight
in
our
doorway
his
eyes
had
fallen
on
some
christian
youths
upon
their
way
to
college
in
european
clothes
with
new
kid
gloves
and
canes
maddened
with
a
sense
of
outrage
by
that
horrid
sight
he
had
attacked
the
said
youths
furiously
with
a
wooden
ladle
putting
them
to
flight
and
chasing
them
all
down
the
long
acacia
avenue
through
two
suburbs
into
the
heart
of
the
city
where
their
miserable
cries
for
help
brought
the
police
upon
him
rashîd
pursuing
in
vain
attempts
to
calm
the
holy
warrior
had
seen
him
taken
into
custody
still
flourishing
the
ladle
but
could
tell
me
nothing
of
his
after
fate
having
at
that
point
deemed
it
prudent
to
retire
lest
he
too
might
be
put
in
prison
by
mistake
it
was
sad
as
soon
as
i
was
up
and
dressed
i
wrote
to
hamdi
bey
the
chief
of
our
intended
visitors
informing
him
of
the
mishap
which
would
prevent
our
giving
him
and
his
comrades
a
dinner
at
all
worthy
of
their
merit
by
the
time
that
i
had
finished
dressing
rashîd
had
found
a
messenger
to
whom
the
note
was
given
with
an
order
to
make
haste
he
must
have
run
the
whole
way
there
and
back
for
after
little
more
than
half
an
hour
he
stood
before
me
breathless
and
with
streaming
brow
his
bare
legs
dusty
to
the
knee
rashîd
had
then
gone
out
to
do
some
marketing
the
runner
handed
me
a
note
it
said
mention
such
a
trifling
detail
we
shall
of
course
be
charmed
with
anything
you
set
before
us
it
is
for
friendship
not
for
food
we
come
there
was
a
postscript
not
go
and
see
the
judge
suleymân
was
in
the
room
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
a
man
of
decent
birth
but
poor
by
trade
a
dragoman
who
had
acquired
a
reputation
for
unusual
wisdom
when
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
he
came
to
me
unfailingly
wherever
i
might
chance
to
be
established
or
encamped
he
was
sitting
in
a
corner
smoking
his
narghîleh
capriciously
illumined
by
thin
slants
of
light
alive
with
motes
from
the
venetian
blinds
he
seized
upon
the
postscript
crying
is
good
advice
why
not
indeed
let
us
approach
the
judge
therewith
he
coiled
the
tube
of
his
narghîleh
carefully
around
the
bowl
thereof
and
rising
with
the
same
deliberation
threw
upon
his
shoulders
a
white
then
looked
at
me
and
questioned
you
ready
i
do
not
know
the
judge
more
do
i
but
that
my
dear
is
a
disease
which
can
be
remedied
without
much
trouble
we
found
out
the
judge
house
a
servant
told
us
that
his
honour
had
already
started
for
the
court
we
took
a
carriage
and
pursued
his
honour
at
the
court
we
made
inquiry
of
the
crowd
of
witnesses
false
witnesses
for
hire
who
thronged
the
entrance
the
judge
we
heard
had
not
yet
taken
his
seat
we
should
be
sure
to
find
his
honour
in
the
across
the
road
one
of
the
false
witnesses
conducted
us
to
the
said
and
pointed
out
our
man
together
with
his
clerk
and
certain
advocates
one
of
whom
read
aloud
the
morning
news
the
judge
sat
underneath
a
vine
arbour
in
pleasant
shade
he
smiled
his
hands
were
clasped
upon
a
fair
round
belly
suleymân
his
billowing
strolled
forward
coolly
and
presented
me
as
of
the
chief
people
of
the
franks
the
company
arose
and
made
us
welcome
placing
stools
for
our
convenience
highness
comes
to
thee
for
justice
o
most
righteous
judge
he
has
been
wronged
observed
suleymân
dispassionately
the
judge
looked
much
concerned
is
the
case
he
asked
cook
is
snatched
from
us
was
the
reply
we
have
invited
friends
to
dinner
he
a
good
cook
asked
the
judge
with
feeling
your
excellency
will
restore
him
to
us
and
then
join
us
at
the
meal
can
i
be
of
service
in
this
matter
i
motioned
to
suleymân
to
tell
the
story
which
he
did
so
well
that
all
the
company
were
soon
in
fits
of
laughter
the
judge
looked
through
the
cause
list
till
he
found
the
case
putting
a
mark
against
it
on
the
paper
can
we
dine
without
a
cook
i
sighed
despairingly
nothing
said
the
judge
shall
be
with
you
in
an
hour
come
o
my
friends
we
must
to
business
it
grows
late
the
judge
took
leave
of
me
with
much
politeness
said
suleymân
when
they
were
gone
us
go
into
the
court
and
watch
the
course
of
justice
we
crossed
the
narrow
street
to
an
imposing
portal
suleymân
whispered
to
a
soldier
there
on
guard
who
smiled
and
bade
us
enter
with
a
gracious
gesture
the
hall
inside
was
crowded
only
after
much
exertion
could
we
see
the
dais
there
sat
the
judge
and
there
stood
our
lamented
cook
the
picture
of
dejection
a
soldier
at
his
side
displayed
the
wooden
ladle
the
christian
dandies
whom
he
had
assaulted
were
giving
their
account
of
the
adventure
volubly
until
his
honour
with
a
heavy
frown
bade
them
be
silent
then
they
cowered
careful
what
you
say
the
judge
enjoined
have
not
hesitated
to
impute
the
anger
of
this
cook
to
religious
fanaticism
the
nazarenes
are
much
too
ready
to
bring
such
a
charge
against
the
muslims
forgetful
that
there
may
be
other
causes
of
annoyance
nay
many
of
the
charges
brought
have
proved
upon
investigation
to
be
altogether
groundless
you
nazarenes
are
often
insolent
in
your
demeanour
confiding
in
the
favour
of
the
foreign
consuls
foreign
missionaries
you
occasionally
taunt
and
irritate
even
revile
the
muslims
now
even
supposing
your
account
of
this
affair
to
be
correct
which
i
much
doubt
for
on
the
one
hand
i
behold
a
wooden
ladle
of
no
weight
while
on
the
other
there
are
two
fine
with
silver
heads
one
of
the
christian
youths
let
fall
his
stick
in
trepidation
you
are
two
while
this
poor
cook
is
one
even
supposing
what
you
say
is
true
are
you
certain
that
nothing
in
your
appearance
conversation
or
behaviour
gave
him
cause
for
anger
i
incline
to
conjecture
that
you
must
have
flouted
him
or
uttered
it
may
be
some
insult
to
his
creed
beat
us
for
no
reason
and
most
grievously
moaned
one
of
the
assailed
such
language
from
a
muslim
judge
in
a
court
filled
with
muslims
made
the
two
christians
tremble
in
their
shoes
did
not
even
see
him
till
he
started
beating
us
by
allah
my
poor
head
is
sore
my
back
is
broken
with
that
awful
beating
he
was
like
a
madman
the
speaker
and
his
wept
aloud
thou
beat
these
youths
as
he
describes
inquired
the
judge
turning
towards
the
cook
with
like
severity
o
excellency
came
the
bitter
cry
am
an
man
much
slandered
i
never
set
eyes
upon
those
men
until
this
minute
he
also
began
weeping
bitterly
parties
tell
me
lies
exclaimed
the
judge
with
anger
thou
o
cook
didst
beat
these
youths
the
fact
is
known
for
thou
wast
taken
in
the
act
of
beating
them
and
you
o
nazarenes
are
not
much
injured
for
everyone
beholds
you
in
most
perfect
health
with
clothes
unspoilt
the
more
shame
to
you
for
it
is
evident
that
you
bring
the
charge
against
this
muslim
from
religious
hatred
allah
no
o
excellency
we
wish
that
man
no
harm
we
did
but
state
what
happened
are
a
pack
of
rogues
together
roared
the
judge
each
side
pay
one
whole
mejîdi
to
the
court
let
the
parties
now
this
minute
here
before
me
swear
peace
and
lifelong
friendship
for
the
future
and
never
let
me
hear
of
them
again
the
christian
youths
embraced
the
cook
the
cook
embraced
the
christian
youths
repeatedly
all
weeping
in
a
transport
of
delight
at
their
escape
from
punishment
i
paid
the
money
for
our
man
who
then
went
home
with
us
suleymân
upon
the
way
delivering
a
lecture
of
such
high
morality
such
heavenly
language
that
the
poor
simple
fellow
wept
anew
and
called
on
allah
for
forgiveness
is
thy
duty
said
suleymân
approvingly
towards
this
world
also
thou
canst
make
amends
put
forth
thy
utmost
skill
in
cookery
this
evening

chapter
v
nawâdir
we
had
arrived
in
a
village
of
the
mountains
late
one
afternoon
and
were
sauntering
about
the
place
when
some
rude
children
shouted
o
my
uncle
you
have
come
in
two
it
was
the
common
joke
at
sight
of
european
trousers
which
were
rare
in
those
days
but
suleymân
was
much
offended
upon
my
account
he
turned
about
and
read
those
children
a
tremendous
lecture
rebuking
them
severely
for
thus
presuming
to
insult
a
stranger
and
a
guest
his
condemnation
was
supported
on
such
lofty
principles
as
no
man
who
possessed
a
particle
of
religion
or
good
feeling
could
withstand
and
his
eloquence
was
so
commanding
yet
persuasive
that
when
at
length
he
moved
away
not
children
only
but
many
also
of
the
people
followed
him
the
village
was
high
up
beneath
the
summit
of
a
ridge
and
from
a
group
of
rocks
within
a
stone
throw
of
it
could
be
seen
the
sea
a
great
blue
wall
extending
north
and
south
we
perched
among
those
rocks
to
watch
the
sunset
the
village
people
settled
within
earshot
some
below
and
some
above
us
presently
an
old
man
said
speakest
well
o
sage
it
is
a
sin
for
them
to
cry
such
things
behind
a
guest
of
quality
their
misbehaviour
calls
for
strong
correction
but
i
truly
think
that
no
child
who
has
heard
your
honour
sayings
will
ever
be
so
impudent
again
cried
one
of
the
delinquents
knows
that
our
intention
was
not
very
evil
i
hastened
to
declare
that
the
offence
was
nothing
but
suleymân
would
not
allow
me
to
decry
it
honour
is
as
yet
too
young
he
said
severely
understand
the
mystic
value
of
men
acts
and
words
a
word
may
be
well
meant
and
innocent
and
yet
the
cause
of
much
disaster
possessing
in
itself
some
special
virtue
of
malignity
you
all
know
how
the
jânn
attend
on
careless
words
how
if
i
call
a
goat
a
dog
or
cat
by
its
generic
name
without
pointing
to
the
very
animal
intended
a
jinni
will
as
like
as
not
attach
himself
to
me
since
many
of
the
jânn
are
called
by
names
of
animals
you
all
know
also
that
to
praise
the
beauty
of
a
child
without
the
offer
of
that
child
to
allah
as
a
sacrifice
is
fatal
because
there
is
unseen
a
jealous
listener
who
hates
and
would
deform
the
progeny
of
eve
such
facts
as
those
are
known
to
every
ignoramus
and
their
cause
is
plain
but
there
exists
another
and
more
subtle
danger
in
the
careless
use
of
words
particularly
with
regard
to
personal
remarks
like
that
of
these
same
children
when
they
cried
to
our
good
master
hast
come
in
two
directing
the
attention
to
a
living
body
i
have
a
rare
thing
in
my
memory
which
perhaps
may
lead
you
to
perceive
my
meaning
darkly
certain
husbandman
fellâh
was
troubled
with
a
foolish
wife
having
to
go
out
one
day
he
gave
her
full
instructions
what
to
do
about
the
place
and
particularly
bade
her
fix
her
mind
upon
their
cow
because
he
was
afraid
the
cow
might
stray
as
she
had
done
before
and
cause
with
the
neighbours
he
never
thought
that
such
a
charge
to
such
a
person
tending
to
concentrate
the
woman
mind
upon
a
certain
object
was
disastrous
the
man
meant
well
the
woman
too
meant
well
she
gave
her
whole
mind
to
obey
his
parting
words
having
completed
every
task
within
the
house
she
sat
down
under
an
olive
tree
which
grew
before
the
door
and
fixed
her
whole
intelligence
in
all
its
force
upon
the
cow
the
only
living
thing
in
sight
which
was
browsing
in
the
space
allowed
by
a
short
tether
so
great
did
the
responsibility
appear
to
her
that
she
grew
anxious
and
by
dint
of
earnest
gazing
at
the
cow
came
to
believe
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
in
truth
the
poor
beast
had
exhausted
all
the
grass
within
its
reach
and
it
had
not
entered
her
ideas
to
move
the
picket
length
a
neighbour
passed
that
way
she
begged
him
of
his
kindness
to
inspect
the
cow
and
tell
her
what
the
matter
really
was
this
neighbour
was
a
wag
and
knew
the
woman
species
he
also
knew
the
cow
as
an
annoyance
for
ever
dragging
out
its
peg
and
straying
into
planted
fields
after
long
and
serious
examination
he
declared
the
tail
is
hurting
her
and
ought
to
be
removed
see
how
she
swishes
it
from
side
to
side
if
the
tail
is
not
cut
off
immediately
the
cow
will
die
one
day
merciful
allah
cried
the
woman
please
remove
it
for
me
i
am
all
alone
and
helpless
man
lifted
up
an
axe
which
he
was
carrying
and
cut
off
the
tail
near
the
rump
he
gave
it
to
the
woman
and
she
thanked
him
heartily
he
went
his
way
while
she
resumed
her
watch
upon
the
cow
and
still
she
fancied
that
its
health
was
not
as
usual
neighbour
came
along
she
told
him
of
her
fears
and
how
the
sheykh
mukarram
of
his
kindness
had
befriended
her
by
cutting
off
the
damaged
tail
of
course
cried
the
newcomer
that
accounts
for
it
the
animal
is
now
it
is
always
a
mistake
to
take
from
one
end
without
removing
something
also
from
the
other
if
thou
wouldst
see
that
cow
in
health
again
the
horns
must
go
oh
help
me
i
am
all
alone
perform
the
operation
for
me
said
the
woman
friend
sawed
off
the
horns
and
gave
them
to
her
she
exhausted
thanks
but
still
when
he
was
gone
the
cow
appeared
no
better
she
grew
desperate
then
the
news
of
her
anxiety
about
the
cow
had
spread
through
all
the
village
and
every
able
body
came
to
help
her
or
look
on
they
cut
the
udder
and
the
ears
and
then
the
legs
and
gave
them
to
her
and
she
thanked
them
all
with
tears
of
gratitude
at
last
there
was
no
cow
at
all
to
worry
over
seeing
the
diminished
carcase
lying
motionless
the
woman
smiled
and
murmured
praise
to
allah
she
is
cured
at
last
she
is
at
rest
now
i
am
free
to
go
into
the
house
and
get
things
ready
for
my
lord
return
lord
returned
at
dusk
she
told
him
i
have
been
obedient
i
watched
the
cow
and
tended
her
for
hours
she
was
extremely
ill
but
all
the
neighbours
helped
to
doctor
her
performing
many
operations
and
we
were
able
to
relieve
her
of
all
pain
the
praise
to
allah
here
are
the
various
parts
which
they
removed
they
gave
them
to
me
very
kindly
since
the
cow
is
ours
a
word
the
man
went
out
to
view
the
remnant
of
the
cow
when
he
returned
he
seized
the
woman
by
the
shoulders
and
gazing
straight
into
her
eyes
said
grimly
allah
keep
thee
i
am
going
to
walk
this
world
until
i
find
one
filthier
than
thou
art
and
if
i
fail
to
find
one
filthier
than
thou
art
i
shall
go
on
walking
i
have
sworn
it
to
the
end
suleymân
broke
off
there
suddenly
to
the
surprise
of
all
fail
to
see
how
that
rare
thing
applies
to
my
case
i
observed
as
soon
as
i
felt
sure
that
he
had
finished
speaking
does
not
apply
to
your
case
but
it
does
to
others
he
replied
on
brief
reflection
is
dangerous
to
put
ideas
in
people
heads
or
rouse
for
who
can
tell
what
demons
lurk
in
people
brains
but
wait
and
i
will
find
a
rare
thing
suited
to
the
present
instance
o
sea
of
wisdom
did
he
find
one
filthier
than
she
was
course
he
did
the
sequel
i
beseech
thee
but
suleymân
was
searching
in
his
memory
for
some
event
more
clearly
illustrating
the
grave
risks
of
chance
suggestion
at
length
he
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
then
spoke
as
follows
was
once
a
turkish
pasha
of
the
greatest
a
benevolent
old
man
whom
i
have
often
seen
he
had
a
long
white
beard
of
which
he
was
extremely
proud
until
one
day
a
man
who
was
a
wag
came
up
to
him
and
said
excellency
we
have
been
wondering
when
you
go
to
bed
do
you
put
your
beard
inside
the
coverings
or
out
pasha
thought
a
moment
but
he
could
not
tell
for
it
had
never
come
into
his
head
to
notice
such
a
matter
he
promised
to
inform
his
questioner
upon
the
morrow
but
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
tried
the
beard
beneath
the
bedclothes
and
above
without
success
neither
way
could
he
get
comfort
nor
could
he
for
the
life
of
him
remember
how
the
beard
was
wont
to
go
he
got
no
sleep
on
that
night
or
the
next
night
either
for
thinking
on
the
problem
thus
presented
to
his
mind
on
the
third
day
in
a
rage
he
called
a
barber
and
had
the
beard
cut
off
accustomed
as
he
was
to
such
a
mass
of
hair
upon
his
neck
for
lack
of
it
he
caught
a
cold
and
died
story
fits
the
case
before
us
to
a
nicety
said
suleymân
in
conclusion
with
an
air
of
triumph
is
the
moral
of
it
deign
to
tell
us
master
the
cry
arose
from
all
sides
in
the
growing
twilight
suppose
i
hazarded
having
had
attention
called
to
the
peculiar
clothing
of
my
legs
i
shall
eventually
have
them
amputated
or
wear
turkish
trousers
say
not
what
will
happen
god
alone
knows
that
but
the
mere
chance
that
such
catastrophes
as
i
have
shown
may
happen
is
enough
to
make
wise
people
shun
that
kind
of
speech
i
can
not
to
this
day
distinguish
how
much
of
his
long
harangue
was
jest
and
how
much
earnest
but
the
fellâhîn
devoured
it
as
pure
wisdom

happened
to
the
man
who
went
to
seek
one
filthier
than
she
was
how
could
he
ever
find
one
filthier
inquired
rashîd
reverting
to
suleymân
unfinished
story
of
the
foolish
woman
and
her
husband
and
the
hapless
cow
when
we
lay
down
to
sleep
that
evening
in
the
village
i
also
asked
to
hear
the
rest
of
that
instructive
tale
suleymân
sufficiently
besought
raised
himself
upon
an
elbow
and
resumed
the
narrative
rashîd
and
i
lay
quiet
in
our
wrappings
had
reached
that
point
my
masters
where
the
injured
husband
having
seen
the
remnant
of
the
cow
said
to
his
wife
now
i
am
going
to
walk
this
world
until
i
find
one
filthier
than
thou
art
and
if
i
fail
to
find
one
filthier
than
thou
art
i
shall
go
on
walking
till
i
die
well
he
walked
and
he
walked
for
months
some
people
say
and
others
years
until
he
reached
a
village
in
mount
lebanon
a
village
of
the
maronites
renowned
for
foolishness
it
was
the
reputation
of
their
imbecility
which
made
him
go
there
was
his
name
inquired
rashîd
who
liked
to
have
things
clear
name
said
suleymân
reflectively
sâlih
was
a
muslim
a
muslim
i
suppose
though
allah
knows
he
may
perhaps
have
been
an
ismaîli
or
a
druze
any
more
questions
then
i
will
proceed
came
into
this
village
of
the
maronites
and
being
thirsty
looked
in
at
a
doorway
he
saw
the
village
priest
and
all
his
family
engaged
in
stuffing
a
fat
sheep
with
mulberry
leaves
the
sheep
was
tethered
up
the
steps
which
led
on
to
the
housetop
the
priest
and
his
wife
together
with
their
eldest
girl
sat
on
the
ground
below
amid
a
heap
of
mulberry
boughs
and
all
the
other
children
sat
one
on
every
step
passing
up
the
leaves
when
ready
to
the
second
daughter
whose
business
was
to
force
the
sheep
to
go
on
eating
this
they
would
do
until
the
sheep
too
full
to
stand
fell
over
on
its
side
when
they
would
slaughter
it
for
their
supply
of
fat
throughout
the
coming
year
busy
were
they
in
this
occupation
that
they
did
not
see
the
stranger
in
the
doorway
until
he
shouted
peace
upon
this
house
and
asked
them
for
a
drink
of
water
kindly
even
then
the
priest
did
not
disturb
himself
but
saying
itfaddal
pointed
to
a
pitcher
standing
by
the
wall
the
guest
looked
into
it
and
found
it
dry
no
water
here
he
said
oh
sighed
the
priest
we
are
so
thirsty
with
this
work
that
we
have
emptied
it
and
so
busy
that
the
children
have
forgotten
to
refill
it
rise
o
nesîbeh
take
the
pitcher
on
thy
head
and
hasten
to
the
spring
and
bring
back
water
for
our
guest
girl
nesîbeh
who
was
fourteen
years
of
age
rose
up
obediently
shaking
off
the
mulberry
leaves
and
caterpillars
from
her
clothing
taking
up
the
pitcher
she
went
out
through
the
village
to
the
spring
which
gushed
out
of
the
rock
beneath
a
spreading
pear
tree
were
so
many
people
getting
water
at
the
moment
that
she
could
not
push
her
way
among
them
so
sat
down
to
wait
her
turn
choosing
a
shady
spot
she
was
a
thoughtful
girl
and
as
she
sat
there
waiting
she
was
saying
in
her
soul
o
soul
i
am
a
big
girl
now
a
year
or
two
and
mother
will
unite
me
to
a
proper
husband
the
next
year
i
shall
have
a
little
son
again
a
year
or
two
he
will
be
big
enough
to
run
about
and
his
father
will
make
for
him
a
pair
of
small
red
shoes
and
he
will
come
down
to
this
pleasant
spring
as
children
do
to
splash
the
water
being
a
bold
lad
he
will
climb
that
tree
then
as
she
beheld
one
great
bough
overhanging
like
a
arm
and
realised
how
dangerous
it
was
for
climbing
children
she
thought
he
will
fall
down
and
break
his
neck
once
she
burst
out
weeping
inconsolably
making
so
great
a
din
that
all
the
people
who
had
come
for
water
flocked
around
her
asking
o
nesîbeh
what
has
hurt
thee
and
between
her
sobs
she
told
them
i
a
big
girl
now
that
is
so
o
beloved
a
year
or
two
and
mother
will
provide
me
with
a
husband
it
is
likely
another
year
and
i
shall
have
a
little
son
if
god
wills
sighed
the
multitude
with
pious
fervour
again
a
year
or
two
he
will
be
big
enough
to
run
about
and
his
father
will
make
for
him
a
pair
of
small
red
shoes
and
he
will
come
down
to
the
spring
with
other
children
and
will
climb
the
tree
and
oh
you
see
that
big
bough
overhanging
there
he
will
slip
and
fall
and
break
his
neck
ah
woe
that
the
people
cried
o
cruel
fate
and
many
of
them
rent
their
clothes
they
all
sank
down
upon
the
ground
around
nesîbeh
rocking
themselves
to
and
fro
and
wailing
ah
my
little
neighbour
my
poor
dear
little
neighbour
ah
would
that
thou
had
lived
to
bury
me
my
little
neighbour
the
stranger
waiting
for
the
water
grew
impatient
and
he
once
more
ventured
to
interrupt
the
work
of
with
a
remark
that
the
young
girl
was
long
returning
with
her
pitcher
the
priest
said
that
is
true
and
sent
his
second
daughter
to
expedite
the
first
this
girl
went
running
to
the
spring
and
found
the
population
of
the
village
sitting
weeping
on
the
ground
around
her
sister
she
asked
the
matter
they
replied
a
great
calamity
thy
sister
poor
distracted
mother
will
inform
thee
of
its
nature
she
ran
up
to
nesîbeh
who
moaned
out
i
am
a
big
girl
now
a
year
or
two
our
mother
will
provide
me
with
a
husband
the
next
year
i
shall
have
a
little
son
again
a
year
or
two
he
will
be
old
enough
to
run
about
his
father
will
make
for
him
a
pair
of
small
red
shoes
he
comes
down
to
the
spring
to
play
in
childish
wise
he
climbs
that
tree
and
from
that

and
breaks
his
neck
this
sad
news
the
second
girl
forgot
her
errand
she
threw
her
skirt
over
her
head
and
started
shrieking
alas
my
little
nephew
my
poor
dear
little
nephew
would
god
that
thou
had
lived
to
bury
me
my
little
nephew
and
she
too
sat
down
upon
the
ground
to
hug
her
sorrow
with
the
rest
priest
said
that
one
too
is
long
in
coming
i
will
send
another
child
but
thou
must
take
her
place
upon
the
steps
o
stranger
or
else
the
work
of
stuffing
will
be
much
delayed
stranger
did
as
he
was
asked
while
child
after
child
was
sent
till
he
alone
was
left
to
do
the
work
of
carrying
the
fresh
leaves
up
from
the
ground
and
stuffing
them
into
the
sheep
still
none
returned
priest
wife
went
herself
remarking
that
her
husband
and
the
stranger
were
able
by
themselves
to
carry
on
the
work
they
did
so
a
long
while
yet
no
one
came
last
the
priest
rose
saying
i
myself
will
go
and
beat
them
for
this
long
delay
do
thou
o
stranger
feed
the
sheep
meanwhile
cease
not
to
carry
up
the
leaves
and
stuff
him
with
them
lest
all
the
good
work
done
be
lost
through
negligence
anger
the
priest
strode
out
through
the
village
to
the
spring
but
all
his
wrath
was
changed
into
amazement
when
he
saw
the
crowd
of
people
sitting
on
the
ground
convulsed
with
grief
around
the
members
of
his
family
went
up
to
his
wife
and
asked
the
matter
moaned
i
can
not
speak
of
it
ask
poor
nesîbeh
then
turned
to
his
eldest
daughter
who
by
sobs
explained
i
am
a
big
girl
now
that
is
so
o
my
daughter
a
year
or
two
and
you
and
mother
will
provide
me
with
a
husband
that
is
possible
another
year
and
i
shall
have
a
little
son
in
sh
allah
said
her
father
piously
again
a
year
or
two
and
my
son
runs
about
his
father
makes
for
him
a
pair
of
small
red
shoes
he
came
down
to
the
spring
to
play
with
other
children
and
from
that
overhanging
bough
how
shall
i
tell
it
he
fell
and
broke
his
darling
little
neck
nesîbeh
hid
her
face
again
and
wailed
aloud
priest
cut
to
the
heart
by
the
appalling
news
tore
his
cassock
up
from
foot
to
waist
and
threw
the
ends
over
his
face
vociferating
woe
my
little
grandson
my
darling
little
grandson
oh
would
that
thou
had
lived
to
bury
me
my
little
grandson
and
he
too
sank
upon
the
ground
immersed
in
grief
last
the
stranger
wearied
of
the
work
of
stripping
off
the
mulberry
leaves
and
carrying
them
up
the
staircase
to
the
tethered
sheep
he
found
his
thirst
increased
by
such
exertions
he
in
truth
do
that
with
no
one
looking
said
rashîd
must
have
been
as
big
a
fool
as
all
the
others
was
but
in
a
different
way
said
suleymân
walked
down
to
the
spring
and
saw
the
congregation
seated
underneath
the
pear
tree
shrieking
like
sinners
at
the
judgment
day
among
them
sat
the
priest
with
features
hidden
in
his
torn
black
petticoat
he
ventured
to
approach
the
man
and
put
a
question
the
priest
unveiled
his
face
a
moment
and
was
going
to
speak
but
recollection
of
his
sorrow
overcame
him
hiding
his
face
again
he
wailed
alas
my
little
grandson
my
pretty
little
grandson
ah
would
that
thou
hadst
lived
to
bury
me
my
little
grandson
woman
sitting
near
plucked
at
the
stranger
sleeve
and
said
you
see
that
girl
she
will
be
soon
a
year
or
two
and
she
will
certainly
be
married
another
year
and
she
will
have
a
little
son
her
little
son
grows
big
enough
to
run
about
his
father
made
for
him
a
pair
of
small
red
shoes
he
came
down
to
the
spring
to
play
with
other
children
you
see
that
pear
tree
on
a
day
like
this
a
pleasant
afternoon
he
clambered
up
it
and
from
that
bough
which
overhangs
the
fountain
he
fell
and
broke
his
little
neck
upon
those
stones
alas
our
little
neighbour
oh
would
that
thou
had
lived
to
bury
us
our
little
neighbour
and
everyone
began
to
rock
and
wail
anew
stranger
stood
and
looked
upon
them
for
a
moment
then
he
shouted
tfû
and
spat
upon
the
ground
no
other
word
did
he
vouchsafe
to
them
but
walked
away
and
he
continued
walking
till
he
reached
his
native
home
there
sitting
in
his
ancient
seat
he
told
his
wife
take
comfort
o
beloved
i
have
found
one
filthier
suleymân
declared
the
story
finished
there
a
moral
to
it
asked
rashîd
moral
is
replied
the
is
this
however
bad
the
woman
whom
one
happens
to
possess
may
be
be
certain
it
is
always
possible
to
find
a
worse
is
also
possible
to
find
a
better
i
suggested
not
so
sure
of
that
said
suleymân
are
three
several
kinds
of
women
in
the
world
who
all
make
claim
to
be
descended
from
our
father
noah
but
the
truth
is
this
our
father
noah
had
one
daughter
only
and
three
men
desired
her
so
not
to
disappoint
the
other
two
he
turned
his
donkey
and
his
dog
into
two
girls
whom
he
presented
to
them
and
that
accounts
for
the
three
kinds
of
women
now
to
be
observed
the
true
descendants
of
our
father
noah
are
very
rare
may
one
know
them
from
the
others
i
inquired
one
thing
only
they
will
keep
your
secret
the
second
sort
of
woman
will
reveal
your
secret
to
a
friend
the
third
will
make
of
it
a
tale
against
you
and
this
they
do
instinctively
as
dogs
will
bark
or
asses
bray
without
malevolence
or
any
kind
of
forethought
same
priest
of
the
maronites
of
whom
i
told
just
now
in
the
first
days
of
his
married
life
was
plagued
by
his
companion
to
reveal
to
her
the
secrets
people
told
him
in
confession
he
refused
declaring
that
she
would
divulge
them
nay
i
can
keep
a
secret
if
i
swear
to
do
so
only
try
me
she
replied
well
we
shall
see
the
priest
made
answer
in
a
teasing
manner
day
as
he
reclined
upon
the
sofa
in
their
house
that
priest
began
to
moan
and
writhe
as
if
in
agony
his
wife
in
great
alarm
inquired
what
ailed
him
it
is
a
secret
he
replied
which
i
dare
not
confide
to
thee
for
with
it
is
bound
up
my
earthly
welfare
and
my
soul
salvation
i
swear
by
allah
i
will
hide
it
tell
me
she
implored
well
he
replied
as
if
in
torment
i
will
risk
my
life
and
trust
thee
know
thou
art
in
the
presence
of
the
greatest
miracle
i
though
not
a
woman
am
far
gone
with
child
a
thing
which
never
happened
on
the
earth
till
now
and
in
this
hour
it
is
decreed
that
i
produce
my
with
a
terrific
cry
he
thrust
his
hand
beneath
his
petticoat
and
showed
his
wife
a
little
bird
which
he
had
kept
there
hidden
he
let
it
fly
away
out
through
the
window
having
watched
it
disappear
he
said
devoutly
praise
be
to
allah
that
is
over
thou
hast
seen
my
child
this
is
a
sacred
and
an
awful
mystery
preserve
the
secret
or
we
all
are
dead
i
swear
i
will
preserve
it
she
replied
with
fervour
the
miracle
which
she
had
witnessed
burned
her
spirit
she
knew
that
she
must
speak
of
it
or
die
and
so
she
called
upon
a
friend
whose
prudence
she
could
trust
and
binding
her
by
vows
told
her
the
story
woman
also
had
a
trusted
friend
to
whom
she
told
the
story
under
vows
of
secrecy
and
so
on
with
the
consequence
that
that
same
evening
the
priest
received
a
deputation
of
the
village
elders
who
requested
in
the
name
of
the
community
to
be
allowed
to
kiss
the
feet
of
his
mysterious
son
that
little
bird
which
had
a
horn
upon
its
head
and
played
the
flute
priest
said
nothing
to
his
wife
he
did
not
beat
her
he
gave
her
but
one
look
and
yet
from
that
day
forward
she
never
plagued
him
any
more
but
was
submissive
priest
was
wise
on
that
occasion
yet
so
foolish
in
the
other
story
i
objected
way
of
the
majority
of
men
said
suleymân
women
are
more
uniformly
wise
or
foolish
a
happy
night

suleymân

himself
to
sleep
the
usual
of
the
syrian
peasants
a
wick
afloat
upon
a
saucerful
of
oil
and
water
burned
upon
the
ground
between
us
making
great
shadows
dance
upon
the
walls
and

the
last
i
heard
before
i
fell

the

bowed
down

wind
the
change
was
instantaneous

it
seemed
to
me
i
had
observed
that
clouds
were
gathering
upon
the
mountain
peaks
inland
but
i
had
been
riding
in
hot
sunlight
only
a
little
less
intense
than
it
had
been
at
noon
when
suddenly
the
chill
and
shadow
struck
me
then
i
saw
the
sky
completely
overcast
with
a
huge
purple
cloud
which
bellied
down
upon
the
land
and

the

had

tearing
up
and
i
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
mukâri
urging
his
two
beasts
to
hurry
is
a
village
on
the
headland
over
there
a
village
of
circassian
settlers
cried
my
servant
breathless
has
a
bad
name
and
i
had
not
thought
to
spend
the
night
there
but
any
roof
is

such
a
storm

we
may
arrive
before
the
downpour
my
horse
had
broken
to
a
canter
of
his
own
accord
i
urged
him
to
a
gallop
we
flew
round
the
bay
the
village
on
the
headland
took
shape
rapidly
a
few
whitewashed
houses
perched
amid
what
seemed
at
first
to
be
great
rocks
but
on
a
close
approach
revealed
themselves
as
blocks
of
masonry
the
ruins
of
some
city
of
antiquity
from
time
to
time
a
jet
of
spray
shot
up
above
them
white
as
lilies
in
the
gloom
the
sea
was
rising
i
discerned
an
ancient
gateway
opening
on
the
beach
and
set
my
horse
towards
it
while
the
rain
came
down
in
sheets
i
saw
no
more
until
the
ruins
loomed
up
close
before
me
a
blind
wall
right
hand
called
rashîd
and
bearing
to
the
right
i
found
the
gateway
we
waited
underneath
its
vault
until
the
muleteer
a
dripping
object
shrouded
in
a
sack
came
up
with
his
two
mules
and
then
we
once
more
plunged
into
the
deluge
the
path
a
very
rough
one
wavered
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
among
the
ruins
there
were
perhaps
a
dozen
scattered
houses
without
gardens
or
any
sign
of
cultivation
round
them
only
one
of
them
possessed
an
upper
storey
and
towards
that
supposing
it
to
be
the
we
now
picked
our
way
it
stood
alone
right
out
upon
the
promontory
topped
by
clouds
of
spray
a
little
courtyard
gave
us
partial
shelter
while
rashîd
ran
up
some
rough
stone
steps
and
hammered
at
a
door
exclaiming
be
on
this
house
my
master
craves
for
food
and
shelter
and
we
his
servants
ask
the
same
boon
of
thy
goodness
o
master
of
the
house
god
will
reward
thy
hospitality
the
door
was
opened
and
a
man
appeared
bidding
us
all
come
in
in
allah
name
he
was
of
middle
height
and
with
a
heavy
grey
moustache
an
fez
with
large
blue
tassel
was
bound
about
his
brow
with
an
embroidered
turban
a
blue
zouave
jacket
crimson
vest
and
baggy
trousers
of
a
darker
blue
completed
his
apparel
for
his
feet
were
bare
in
his
girdle
were
a
pair
of
pistols
and
a
scimitar
he
bade
us
welcome
in
bad
arabic
showing
us
into
a
room
the
upper
chamber
we
had
seen
from
far
its
windows
innocent
of
glass
were
closed
by
wooden
shutters
roughly
bolted
which
creaked
and
rattled
in
the
gale
a
very
old
man
rose
from
the
divan
to
greet
us
countryman
art
thou
a
turk
or
one
of
us
he
asked
as
i
removed
my
englishman
sayest
thou
he
seized
my
hand
and
pressed
it
englishman
any
englishman
is
good
and
his
word
is
sure
but
the
english
government
is
very
bad
three
englishmen
in
kars
behaved
like
fought
like
devils
and
while
they
fought
for
us
their
government
betrayed
our
country
what
thou
hast
heard
about
it
praise
to
allah
at
last
i
meet
with
one
who
can
confirm
the
story
my
son
here
thinks
that
i
invented
it
i
happened
to
have
read
of
the
defence
of
kars
under
the
leadership
of
three
heroic
englishmen
general
williams
captain
teesdale
and
doctor
sandwith
and
of
the
betrayal
of
the
circassian
rising
under
shamyl
at
the
time
of
the
crimean
war
the
old
man
was
delighted
o
my
son
he
called
out
to
the
person
who
had
let
us
in
is
true
what
i
have
often
told
to
thee
this
englishman
knows
all
about
it
so
does
all
the
world
except
such
blockheads
as
thyself
and
thy
companions
his
son
begged
to
be
excused
a
minute
while
he
put
his
crops
into
the
barn
therewith
he
dragged
a
sack
out
of
the
room
what
crops
he
may
have
grown
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
know
the
contents
of
that
sack
clanked
as
he
dragged
it
out
when
he
returned
he
brought
a
bowl
of
eggs
cooked
in
clarified
butter
two
slabs
of
bread
and
a
great
jug
of
water
apologising
for
the
coarseness
of
the
fare
we
all
supped
together
the
old
man
babbling
of
the
days
of
old
with
great
excitement
his
son
stared
at
me
with
unblinking
eyes
at
last
he
said
like
thee
o
khawâjah
i
had
once
a
son
about
thy
age
say
o
my
father
is
there
not
a
strong
resemblance
thereafter
he
talked
quite
as
much
as
the
old
man
giving
me
the
history
of
their
emigration
from
the
caucasus
to
escape
the
yoke
of
the
accursed
muscovite
and
enumerating
all
the
troubles
which
attended
their
first
coming
into
syria
are
not
subjects
of
the
government
he
told
me
allies
and
we
have
special
privileges
but
the
dishonoured
dogs
round
here
forget
old
compacts
and
want
us
to
pay
taxes
like
mere
fellâhîn
we
sat
up
talking
far
into
the
night
while
the
storm
raged
without
and
the
rain
and
the
pounded
on
the
shutters
and
never
have
i
met
with
kinder
treatment
it
was
the
custom
for
chance
comers
to
have
food
at
evening
only
and
leave
betimes
next
morning
but
our
host
when
i
awoke
in
splendid
sunlight
had
breakfast
ready
sour
milk
and
arab
bread
and
fragrant
coffee
and
when
i
went
out
to
my
horse
he
followed
me
and
thrust
two
roasted
fowls
into
my
exclaiming
which
means
for
the
road
and
much
to
my
abashment
he
and
the
old
man
fell
upon
my
neck
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
people
the
very
best
of
people
they
would
take
no
money
god
reward
them
chanted
rashîd
as
we
rode
out
of
the
ruins
inland
through
a
garden
of
wild
flowers
the
storm
had
passed
completely
not
a
cloud
remained
after
an
hour
we
came
in
sight
of
a
large
khan
outside
a
village
on
the
shore
before
it
was
a
crowd
including
several
soldiers
as
we
drew
near
rashîd
inquired
the
meaning
of
the
throng
great
calamity
he
was
informed
man
a
foreigner
is
dying
killed
by
highwaymen
one
of
his
companions
a
poor
servant
is
already
dead
we
both
dismounted
and
rashîd
pushed
in
to
learn
more
of
the
matter
presently
a
soldier
came
to
me
honour
is
an
englishman
he
questioned
be
to
allah
i
am
much
relieved
this
other
also
is
an
englishman
they
tell
me
he
is
severely
wounded
at
the
gate
of
death
i
went
with
him
at
once
to
see
the
sufferer
who
seemed
relieved
to
hear
me
speak
but
could
not
answer
rashîd
and
i
did
what
we
could
to
make
him
comfortable
giving
the
soldiers
orders
to
keep
out
the
crowd
we
decided
to
ride
on
and
send
a
doctor
and
then
report
the
matter
to
a
british
consul
was
going
down
to
start
some
kind
of
business
in
the
city
over
there
the
leader
of
the
soldiers
told
me
nodding
towards
the
south
had
a
largeish
company
with
several
camels
but
near
the
village
of
he
was
attacked
by
the
circassians
and
was
so
foolish
as
to
make
resistance
they
took
everything
he
had
of
worth
his
arms
his
money
and
killed
a
besides
wounding
him
it
happened
yesterday
before
the
storm
they
say
i
should
take
vengeance
for
him
what
am
i
a
corporal
with
six
men
to
strive
with
huseyn
agha
and
his
cavalry
it
needs
a
regiment
he
went
grumbling
off
rashîd
and
i
were
staring
hard
at
one
another
for
the
village
named
was
that
where
we
had
spent
the
night
and
huseyn
agha
roasted
fowls
were
in
our
rashîd
as
i
could
see
was
troubled
upon
my
account
he
kept
silence
a
good
while
at
last
he
said
is
like
this
my
lord
each
man
must
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
not
another
people
are
as
one
finds
them
good
or
bad
they
change
with
each
man
vision
yet
remain
the
same
for
us
those
highway
robbers
are
good
people
we
must
bless
them
having
cause
to
do
so
this
other
man
is
free
to
curse
them
if
he
will
good
to
their
friends
bad
to
their
enemies
what
creature
of
the
sons
of
adam
can
condemn
them
quite
chapter
viii
police
work
having
to
dress
for
dinner
on
a
certain
evening
i
took
off
my
and
quite
forgot
to
put
it
on
again
it
happened
to
contain
twelve
english
pounds
i
left
it
lying
on
the
table
in
the
hotel
bedroom
when
i
came
back
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
it
was
gone
rashîd
who
slept
out
at
a
khan
in
charge
of
our
two
horses
came
in
at
eight
to
rouse
me
hearing
of
my
loss
he
gave
me
the
worst
scolding
i
have
ever
had
and
then
went
out
to
blow
up
the
hotel
proprietor
it
was
for
once
a
real
hotel
with
table
and
a
everything
in
fact
excepting
drains
the
owner
was
a
fat
brown
individual
whom
i
had
generally
seen
recumbent
on
a
sofa
in
his
office
while
someone
of
his
many
sons
did
all
the
work
but
that
he
could
show
energy
upon
occasion
i
now
learnt
hearing
from
rashîd
that
i
a
guest
in
his
hotel
had
suffered
robbery
he
sprang
on
to
his
feet
and
danced
with
rage
when
i
arrived
upon
the
scene
which
was
the
an
open
courtyard
shaded
by
an
awning
he
was
flourishing
a
monstrous
whip
with
dreadful
imprecations
literally
foaming
at
the
mouth
i
begged
him
to
do
nothing
rash
but
he
seemed
not
to
hear
me
with
the
squeal
of
a
fighting
stallion
he
rushed
off
to
the
servants
quarters
whence
presently
there
came
heartrending
shrieks
and
cries
for
mercy
his
sons
in
fear
of
murder
followed
him
and
added
their
remonstrance
to
the
general
din
the
women
of
his
house
appeared
in
doorways
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
rashîd
seemed
gratified
by
this
confusion
regarded
as
a
tribute
to
our
greatness
his
and
mine
good
enough
to
go
away
he
told
me
scene
is
quite
unworthy
of
your
dignity
i
will
take
care
that
all
is
done
to
raise
your
honour
i
remained
however
presently
the
host
returned
perspiring
freely
mopping
his
brown
face
with
a
crimson
handkerchief
he
smiled
as
one
who
has
had
healthy
exercise
is
no
use
he
told
me
with
a
shrug
beat
them
well
and
every
one
of
them
confessed
that
he
alone
and
not
another
was
the
thief
each
as
his
turn
came
wished
to
stay
my
hand
at
any
cost
he
sank
down
on
a
sofa
which
was
in
the
court
further
is
your
honour
will
he
asked
will
beat
anyone
the
story
is
so
bad
for
the
hotel
i
should
be
ruined
if
it
reached
the
ears
of
cook
or
baedeker
the
cries
of
those
unhappy
servants
having
shamed
me
i
told
him
that
i
was
content
to
count
the
money
lost
rather
than
that
harmless
folk
should
suffer
for
my
carelessness
rashîd
protested
saying
twelve
pounds
was
no
trifle
although
i
might
in
youthful
folly
so
regard
it
he
as
my
servant
had
to
guard
my
wealth
gold
is
lost
it
is
the
will
of
allah
let
it
be
i
answered
irritably
wilt
not
tell
the
english
consul
cried
the
host
with
sudden
eagerness
wilt
refrain
from
saying
any
word
to
cook
or
baedeker
to
bring
and
ruin
on
the
place
our
lord
augment
thy
wealth
and
guard
thee
always
may
thy
progeny
increase
in
honour
till
it
rules
the
world
something
must
be
done
rashîd
remonstrated
crime
has
been
committed
we
must
find
the
culprit
said
the
host
i
will
help
with
all
my
strength
the
consul
would
not
help
at
all
he
would
but
frighten
the
police
with
the
result
that
they
would
torture
perhaps
hang
a
man
or
two
but
not
the
man
who
stole
your
belt
of
money
our
police
when
not
alarmed
are
clever
go
to
them
and
give
a
little
money
they
will
find
the
thief
go
this
minute
said
rashîd
i
bade
him
wait
knowing
his
way
of
magnifying
me
and
my
possessions
i
thought
it
better
to
be
present
at
the
interview
lest
he
should
frighten
the
police
no
less
than
would
the
intervention
of
a
consul
we
went
together
through
the
shady
markets
crossing
here
and
there
an
open
space
of
blinding
sunlight
asking
our
way
at
intervals
until
at
last
we
entered
a
large
whitewashed
room
where
soldiers
loitered
and
a
official
sat
writing
at
a
desk
this
personage
was
very
sympathetic
pounds
he
cried
is
a
serious
sum
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
survey
the
scene
of
crime
wait
i
will
send
with
you
a
knowing
man
he
called
one
of
the
soldiers
who
stepped
forward
and
saluted
and
gave
him
charge
of
the
affair
can
place
confidence
in
him
he
knows
his
business
he
assured
me
bowing
with
extreme
politeness
as
we
took
our
leave
with
the
soldier
who
had
been
assigned
to
us
we
sauntered
back
to
the
hotel
the
man
abounded
in
compassion
for
me
he
said
it
was
the
worst
case
he
had
ever
heard
of
to
rob
a
man
so
manifestly
good
and
amiable
of
so
great
a
sum
alas
the
badness
of
some
people
it
put
out
the
sun
at
the
hotel
he
spent
a
long
while
in
my
room
searching
as
he
said
for
rashîd
the
host
and
all
his
family
and
nearly
all
the
servants
thronged
the
doorway
after
looking
into
every
drawer
and
crawling
underneath
the
bed
which
he
unmade
completely
he
spent
some
minutes
in
debating
whether
the
thief
had
entered
by
the
window
or
the
door
having
at
last
decided
for
the
door
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
there
was
anybody
i
suspected
when
i
answered
i
saw
him
throw
a
at
rashîd
as
if
he
thought
him
fortunate
in
having
so
obtuse
a
master
as
he
was
departing
rashîd
at
my
command
gave
him
a
silver
coin
for
which
he
kissed
my
hand
and
having
done
so
said
know
a
clever
man
none
like
him
for
such
business
i
will
send
him
to
your
presence
in
an
hour
three
hours
passed
i
had
finished
luncheon
and
was
sipping
coffee
in
the
lounge
when
a
sleek
personage
in
gorgeous
robes
was
brought
to
me
he
had
a
trick
of
looking
down
his
nose
at
his
moustache
the
while
he
stroked
it
with
a
gentle
smirk
excellency
has
been
robbed
he
murmured
in
a
secret
tone
you
would
know
the
robber
there
is
nothing
simpler
i
have
discovered
many
thieves
i
think
it
likely
that
i
know
the
very
man
i
will
disguise
myself
as
an
old
woman
or
a
begging
dervish
there
are
many
ways
but
first
your
honour
must
bestow
on
me
an
english
pound
that
is
my
fee
it
is
but
little
for
such
services
i
answered
languidly
that
the
affair
had
ceased
to
thrill
me
i
wished
to
hear
no
more
about
the
money
or
the
thief
he
stayed
a
long
while
wheedling
and
remonstrating
depicting
his
own
subtlety
in
glowing
terms
but
in
the
end
departed
with
despairing
shrugs
and
backward
glances
hoping
that
i
might
relent
rashîd
who
had
been
out
to
tend
the
horses
came
presently
and
asked
if
i
had
seen
the
great
detective
when
i
described
our
interview
he
nearly
wept
people
here
think
me
the
thief
he
told
me
say
nothing
but
i
feel
it
in
their
bearing
towards
me
and
now
you
give
up
seeking
for
the
culprit
am
i
to
bear
this
shame
for
evermore
here
was
a
new
dilemma
no
way
out
of
it
appeared
to
me
for
even
if
we
did
employ
the
great
detective
our
chance
of
finding
the
delinquent
seemed
exceeding
small
i
was
thinking
what
could
possibly
be
done
to
clear
rashîd
when
a
familiar
figure
came
into
the
court
and
strolled
towards
us
it
was
suleymân
i
had
imagined
him
three
hundred
miles
away
at
gaza
in
the
south
of
palestine
loud
were
our
exclamations
but
his
calm
rebuked
us
i
never
knew
him
show
excitement
or
surprise
he
heard
our
story
with
deliberation
and
shook
his
head
at
the
police
and
the
detective
use
at
all
he
scoffed
one
man
for
your
purpose
is
the
chief
of
the
thieves
i
know
him
intimately
is
there
then
a
guild
of
thieves
is
sheykh
of
the
thieves
must
be
the
greatest
rogue
i
do
not
care
to
have
to
do
with
him
err
remarked
suleymân
with
dignity
error
has
its
root
in
the
conviction
that
a
thief
is
evil
he
may
be
evil
as
an
individual
all
men
are
apt
to
be
who
strive
for
gain
but
as
a
member
of
a
corporation
he
has
pride
and
honour
with
europeans
it
is
just
the
opposite
they
individually
are
more
honourable
than
their
governments
and
corporations
the
sheykh
of
the
thieves
i
can
assure
you
is
the
soul
of
honour
i
go
at
once
to
see
him
he
can
clear
rashîd
he
does
that
he
is
the
best
of
men
exclaimed
my
servant
an
hour
later
one
of
the
hotel
men
much
excited
came
to
tell
me
that
some
soldiers
were
approaching
who
had
caught
the
thief
the
host
and
all
his
family
ran
out
into
the
hall
rashîd
and
all
the
servants
came
from
kitchen
purlieus
four
soldiers
entered
with
triumphant
exclamations
dragging
and
pushing
forward
suleymân
the
prisoner
demeanour
had
its
usual
calm
have
regained
the
belt
he
called
to
me
men
were
watching
near
the
house
and
found
it
on
me
they
would
not
hear
reason
the
man
who
stole
the
belt
a
greek
has
left
the
city
he
gave
the
sheykh
the
belt
but
kept
the
money
the
soldiers
disappointed
let
him
go
dost
thou
know
all
that
inquired
their
leader
headman
of
the
thieves
informed
me
of
it
then
it
is
the
truth
the
soldier
nodded
is
a
man
of
honour
he
would
not
deceive
thee
i
do
not
claim
to
understand
these
things
i
but
relate
them
chapter
ix
my
countryman
one
summer
in
the
south
of
syria
amid
that
tumbled
wilderness
of
cliff
and
chasm
shale
and
boulder
which
surges
all
around
the
sea
of
lot
we
had
been
riding
since
the
dawn
without
encountering
a
human
being
and
with
relief
at
last
espied
a
village
having
some
trace
of
cultivated
land
about
it
and
a
tree
rashîd
was
on
ahead
suleymân
had
been
beside
me
but
had
dropped
behind
in
order
to
perform
some
operation
on
his
horse
hoof
as
i
came
down
the
last
incline
on
to
the
village
level
i
heard
angry
shouts
and
saw
a
crowd
of
fellâhîn
on
foot
mobbing
rashîd
urging
my
horse
i
shouted
to
him
to
know
what
was
happening
at
once
a
number
of
the
villagers
forsook
him
and
surrounded
me
waving
their
arms
about
and
talking
volubly
i
had
gathered
from
their
iteration
of
the
one
word
that
water
was
the
matter
in
dispute
even
before
rashîd
succeeded
in
rejoining
me
he
said
rode
up
to
the
spring
which
flows
beneath
that
arch
and
was
letting
my
horse
drink
from
the
stone
trough
of
water
when
these
maniacs
rushed
up
and
dragged
my
horse
away
and
made
this
noise
they
say
the
water
in
the
spring
is
theirs
and
no
one
else
has
any
right
to
touch
it
i
offered
to
make
payment
but
they
would
not
hear
me
i
threatened
them
with
vengeance
but
they
showed
no
fear
is
it
your
honour
will
that
i
should
beat
a
few
of
them
seeing
their
numbers
i
considered
it
the
wiser
plan
for
us
to
let
them
be
till
their
excitement
had
cooled
down
and
till
suleymân
arrived
to
help
us
with
advice
accordingly
i
smiled
and
nodded
to
the
villagers
and
rode
back
up
the
path
a
little
way
rashîd
obeying
my
example
with
reluctance
muttering
curses
on
their
faith
and
ancestry
then
we
dismounted
and
lay
down
in
the
shadow
of
some
rocks
it
wanted
still
two
hours
before
the
sun
would
set
suleymân
came
on
us
and
dismounted
at
a
call
from
me
is
the
noise
down
there
he
questioned
looking
at
the
village
with
that
coolness
like
indifference
habitual
to
his
face
when
meeting
problems
of
importance
will
not
let
us
touch
the
water
curse
their
fathers
growled
rashîd
anyone
the
like
of
such
inhospitality
it
would
but
serve
them
right
if
we
destroyed
their
houses
suleymân
screwed
up
his
eyes
the
better
to
survey
the
crowd
of
villagers
below
who
now
sat
guard
around
the
spring
and
murmured
carelessly
is
evident
that
thou
hast
angered
them
o
son
of
rashness
we
shall
do
well
to
wait
before
approaching
them
again
with
our
polite
request
therewith
he
stretched
his
length
upon
the
ground
with
a
luxurious
sigh
and
would
i
think
have
gone
to
sleep
had
not
rashîd
conceiving
himself
blamed
thought
necessary
to
relate
in
full
the
whole
adventure
else
could
man
have
done
he
asked
defiantly
in
what
respect
however
trifling
did
i
act
unwisely
allah
thou
didst
nothing
wrong
and
yet
thou
mightest
have
done
better
since
thy
efforts
led
to
failure
said
the
sage
benignly
art
a
soldier
yet
in
thought
and
thy
one
method
is
to
threaten
if
that
avails
not
thou
art
helpless
there
are
other
ways
offered
money
cried
rashîd
indignantly
man
do
more
are
those
other
ways
instruct
us
o
beloved
i
put
in
to
save
rashîd
from
feeling
lonely
under
blame
for
ignorance
truly
great
one
ever
argues
with
a
crowd
he
chooses
out
one
man
and
speaks
to
him
him
only
said
suleymân
and
he
was
going
to
tell
us
more
but
just
then
something
in
the
wadi
down
below
the
village
caught
his
eye
and
he
sat
up
forgetting
our
dilemma
marvel
he
exclaimed
after
a
moment
spent
in
gazing
i
suppose
since
first
this
village
was
created
have
two
franks
approached
it
in
a
single
day
before
thou
art
as
one
of
us
in
outward
seeming
he
remarked
to
me
yonder
comes
a
perfect
frank
with
two
attendants
we
looked
in
the
direction
which
his
finger
pointed
and
beheld
a
man
on
horseback
clad
in
white
from
head
to
foot
with
a
pith
helmet
and
a
puggaree
followed
by
two
native
servants
leading
horses
are
in
need
of
water
growled
rashîd
uninterested
in
the
sight
is
a
sin
for
those
low
people
to
refuse
it
to
us
us
first
wait
and
see
how
this
newcomer
fares
what
method
he
adopts
replied
suleymân
reclining
once
more
at
his
ease
the
frank
and
his
attendants
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
headed
naturally
for
the
spring
the
fellâhîn
already
put
upon
their
guard
by
rashîd
venture
opposed
them
in
a
solid
mass
the
frank
expostulated
we
could
hear
his
voice
of
high
command
he
knows
some
arabic
he
is
a
missionary
not
a
traveller
said
suleymân
who
now
sat
up
and
showed
keen
interest
might
have
known
it
for
the
touring
season
is
long
past
he
rose
with
dignified
deliberation
and
remounted
we
followed
him
as
he
rode
slowly
down
towards
the
scene
of
strife
when
we
arrived
the
frank
after
laying
about
him
vainly
with
his
had
drawn
out
a
revolver
he
was
being
stoned
his
muleteers
had
fled
to
a
safe
distance
in
another
minute
as
it
seemed
he
would
have
shot
some
person
when
nothing
under
allah
could
have
saved
his
life
suleymân
cried
out
in
english
you
be
a
fool
sir
do
you
fire
the
frank
looked
round
in
our
direction
with
an
angry
face
but
suleymân
bestowed
no
further
thought
on
him
he
rode
up
to
the
nearest
group
of
fellâhîn
crying
aloud
true
believers
o
asserters
of
the
unity
bless
the
prophet
and
inform
me
straightway
what
has
happened
having
captured
their
attention
by
this
solemn
adjuration
he
inquired
is
the
chief
among
you
let
him
speak
him
only
although
the
crowd
had
seemed
till
then
to
be
without
a
leader
an
old
man
was
thrust
before
him
with
the
cry
our
sheykh
o
lord
of
judgment
question
him
rashîd
and
i
heard
nothing
of
the
conversation
which
ensued
except
the
tone
of
the
two
voices
which
appeared
quite
friendly
and
some
mighty
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
crowd
no
more
stones
were
thrown
although
some
persons
still
kept
guard
over
the
spring
at
length
suleymân
returned
to
us
exclaiming
is
well
they
grant
us
leave
to
take
what
water
we
require
the
spring
has
been
a
trouble
to
these
people
through
the
ages
because
the
wandering
tribes
with
all
their
herds
come
here
in
time
of
drought
and
drink
it
dry
but
now
they
are
our
friends
and
make
us
welcome
he
called
out
to
the
frank
who
all
this
while
had
sat
his
horse
with
an
indignant
air
more
angry
as
it
seemed
to
be
forgotten
than
to
be
assailed
is
all
right
you
take
the
water
and
you
pay
them
five
piastres
is
extortion
cried
the
frank
right
have
they
to
charge
me
money
for
the
water
of
this
natural
spring
which
is
the
gift
of
god
i
will
not
pay
matter
i
pay
for
you
shrugged
suleymân
i
tried
to
make
the
missionary
for
such
he
proved
to
be
upon
acquaintance
understand
that
the
conditions
in
that
desert
country
made
the
spring
a
valued
property
and
gave
a
price
to
every
pitcherful
of
water
are
you
english
was
his
only
answer
as
he
scanned
my
garb
with
pity
and
disgust
who
pray
is
that
person
with
you
who
was
rude
to
me
name
is
suleymân
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
friend
i
hardly
think
replied
the
frank
fastidiously
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
dark
complexion
and
light
eyes
am
going
to
camp
here
i
have
a
tent
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
come
and
sup
with
me
then
we
can
talk
pleasure
i
made
answer
taken
by
surprise
is
your
camp
he
asked
have
got
one
we
put
up
in
the
if
there
is
one
or
under
the
stars
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
he
murmured
with
a
sneer
rashîd
through
all
this
conversation
had
been
standing
by
waiting
to
tell
me
that
suleymân
had
gone
before
into
the
village
to
the
headman
house
where
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
should
pass
the
night
thither
we
went
when
i
had
finished
speaking
to
the
missionary
and
there
we
found
suleymân
enthroned
among
the
village
elders
in
a
long
low
room
he
stood
up
on
my
entrance
as
did
all
the
others
and
explained
have
a
room
near
by
where
we
can
throw
our
but
it
is
verminous
and
so
we
will
not
sleep
inside
it
but
outside
on
the
roof
for
supper
we
are
the
invited
guests
of
the
good
sheykh
and
i
can
tell
you
he
is
getting
ready
a
fine
feast
with
deep
regret
and
some
degree
of
shame
i
told
him
of
my
promise
to
take
supper
with
the
missionary
he
looked
reproach
at
me
and
told
the
villagers
what
i
had
said
they
all
cried
out
in
disappointment
suleymân
suggested
that
i
should
revoke
the
promise
instantly
but
that
i
would
not
do
to
his
annoyance
and
after
that
till
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
he
and
rashîd
were
sulky
and
withdrew
their
eyes
from
me
i
knew
that
they
were
jealous
of
the
frank
whom
they
regarded
as
an
enemy
and
feared
lest
he
should
turn
my
mind
against
them
chapter
x
the
parting
of
the
ways
it
was
dusk
when
i
set
out
for
the
missionary
tent
and
starlit
night
before
i
reached
it
so
fleeting
is
the
summer
twilight
in
that
land
rashîd
went
with
me
as
in
duty
bound
and
insisted
on
remaining
with
the
servants
of
the
missionary
by
the
cook
fire
although
i
told
him
to
go
back
repeatedly
knowing
how
his
mouth
must
water
for
the
headman
feast
the
dudgeon
which
he
felt
at
my
desertion
made
him
determined
not
to
let
me
out
of
sight
and
called
for
the
martyrdom
of
someone
even
let
that
someone
be
himself
the
missionary
called
in
while
i
was
still
a
good
way
off
the
tent
entering
i
found
him
stretched
on
a
with
hands
behind
his
head
he
did
not
rise
upon
my
entrance
but
just
smiled
and
pointed
to
another
chair
beyond
a
little
folding
table
laid
for
supper
he
spoke
of
the
day
heat
and
the
fatigues
of
travel
and
the
flies
and
asked
me
how
i
could
endure
to
sleep
in
native
hovels
full
of
fleas
and
worse
i
told
him
that
by
suleymân
arrangement
we
were
to
sleep
upon
the
roof
for
safety
he
sniffed
i
then
related
a
discussion
i
had
overheard
between
rashîd
and
suleymân
as
to
the
best
way
of
defeating
those
domestic
pests
thinking
to
make
him
laugh
rashîd
had
spoken
of
the
virtues
of
a
certain
shrub
but
suleymân
declared
the
best
specific
was
a
baby
this
if
laid
within
a
room
for
a
short
while
attracted
every
insect
the
babe
should
then
be
carried
out
and
dusted
the
missionary
did
not
even
smile
brutes
he
murmured
can
you
an
englishman
and
apparently
a
man
of
education
bear
their
intimacy
they
had
their
good
points
i
asserted
though
i
fear
but
lamely
for
the
robustness
of
his
attitude
impressed
me
he
being
a
man
presumably
of
wide
experience
and
what
is
more
a
clergyman
the
kind
of
man
i
had
been
taught
to
treat
with
some
respect
he
said
no
more
till
we
had
finished
supper
which
consisted
of
sardines
and
corned
beef
and
sliced
pineapple
tomatoes
and
butter
out
of
tins
and
some
very
stale
european
bread
which
he
had
brought
with
him
confronted
with
such
mummy
food
i
thought
with
longing
of
the
good
fresh
meal
which
i
had
left
behind
me
at
the
headman
house
he
may
have
guessed
my
thoughts
for
he
observed
never
touch
their
food
it
is
insanitary
which
i
knew
to
be
exactly
what
they
said
of
his
the
man
who
waited
on
us
seemed
to
move
in
fear
and
was
addressed
by
his
employer
very
curtly
after
the
supper
there
was
tea
which
i
confess
was
welcome
and
then
the
missionary
put
me
through
a
kind
of
catechism
finding
out
who
i
was
and
that
we
had
some
friends
in
common
he
frowned
deeply
he
had
heard
of
my
existence
in
the
land
it
seemed
are
you
doing
here
at
all
he
asked
severely
your
age
you
should
be
at
college
or
in
training
for
some
useful
work
learning
things
i
told
him
rather
feebly
his
point
of
view
the
point
of
view
of
all
my
countrymen
imposed
itself
on
me
as
i
sat
there
before
him
deeply
conscious
of
my
youth
and
inexperience
things
he
asked
and
then
his
tongue
was
loosed
he
gave
me
his
opinion
of
the
people
of
the
country
and
particularly
of
my
two
companions
he
had
summed
them
up
at
sight
they
were
two
cunning
rogues
whose
only
object
was
to
fleece
me
he
told
me
stories
about
englishmen
who
had
been
ruined
in
that
very
way
through
making
friends
with
natives
whom
they
thought
devoted
to
them
one
story
ended
in
a
horrid
murder
he
wanted
me
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
them
and
when
he
saw
i
was
attached
to
them
begged
me
earnestly
to
treat
them
always
as
inferiors
to
them
in
their
place
and
this
i
promised
to
do
although
i
knew
that
in
the
way
he
meant
it
was
not
in
me
it
seemed
that
he
himself
was
travelling
in
these
wild
places
in
search
of
an
old
greek
inscription
mention
of
which
he
had
discovered
in
some
book
he
me
to
bear
him
company
are
doing
no
good
here
alone
with
such
companions
he
said
as
i
at
last
departed
over
my
advice
to
you
go
back
to
england
come
with
me
for
the
next
few
days
and
share
my
tents
then
come
and
stay
with
me
in
jerusalem
and
we
can
talk
things
over
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
kindliness
of
his
intention
i
thanked
him
and
strolled
back
toward
the
village
in
the
starlight
rashîd
who
at
my
first
appearance
had
detached
himself
from
a
small
group
which
sat
around
the
missionary
kitchen
fire
stalking
on
before
me
with
a
lantern
it
seemed
a
wonder
that
the
village
dogs
which
had
made
so
great
a
noise
on
our
arrival
in
the
place
so
short
a
while
before
now
took
no
notice
seeming
to
recognise
our
steps
as
those
of
lawful
inmates
at
the
headman
house
suleymân
still
sat
up
talking
with
the
village
elders
he
expressed
a
hope
that
i
had
much
enjoyed
myself
but
with
a
hint
of
grievance
which
i
noticed
as
a
thing
expected
looking
round
upon
those
eager
friendly
faces
i
compared
them
with
the
cold
face
of
the
missionary
who
suddenly
appeared
to
me
as
a
great
bird
of
prey
i
hated
him
instinctively
for
he
was
like
a
schoolmaster
and
yet
his
words
had
weight
for
i
was
young
to
judge
and
schoolmasters
though
hateful
have
a
knack
of
being
in
the
right
at
last
we
three
went
up
on
to
the
roof
to
sleep
we
had
lain
down
and
said
night
to
one
another
when
suleymân
remarked
as
if
soliloquising
will
never
be
the
same
do
you
mean
i
questioned
crossly
missionary
has
spoilt
everything
he
told
you
not
to
trust
us
not
to
be
so
friendly
with
persons
who
are
natives
of
this
land
and
therefore
born
inferior
i
made
no
answer
and
suleymân
went
on
man
who
journeys
in
the
desert
finds
a
guide
among
the
desert
people
and
he
who
journeys
on
the
sea
trusts
seamen
what
allegations
did
he
make
i
pray
you
tell
us
told
me
stories
of
his
own
experience
experience
is
not
never
will
be
yours
he
is
the
enemy
a
tiger
if
one
asked
him
to
describe
mankind
would
doubtless
say
that
they
are
masters
of
the
guile
which
brings
destruction
deserving
only
to
be
clawed
to
death
question
the
pigeons
of
some
mosque
upon
the
other
hand
and
they
will
swear
by
allah
men
are
lords
of
all
benevolence
rashîd
broke
in
boys
with
whom
i
talked
inform
me
that
he
is
devoid
of
all
humanity
he
never
thanks
them
for
their
work
however
perfect
nor
has
a
word
of
blessing
ever
passed
his
lips
he
frowns
continually
how
can
he
be
the
same
as
one
like
thee
who
laughs
and
talks
we
had
all
three
sat
up
unconsciously
and
we
continued
sitting
up
debating
miserably
under
the
great
stars
hearing
the
jackals
voices
answer
one
another
from
hill
to
hill
both
near
and
far
all
through
that
night
drawing
ever
closer
one
to
another
as
we
approached
an
understanding
englishman
such
as
that
missionary
said
suleymân
good
and
bad
alike
as
enemies
if
they
are
not
of
his
nation
he
gives
bare
justice
which
in
human
life
is
cruelty
he
keeps
a
strict
account
with
every
man
we
when
we
love
a
man
keep
no
account
we
never
think
of
what
is
due
to
us
or
our
position
and
when
we
hate
may
god
forgive
us
it
is
just
the
same
save
with
the
very
best
and
coolest
heads
among
us
you
are
cunning
and
have
not
our
code
of
honour
i
objected
with
satirical
intention
though
the
statement
sounded
brutal
honour
says
so
cried
rashîd
half
weeping
doubt
you
are
referring
to
that
theft
in
the
hotel
of
which
you
thought
so
little
at
the
time
that
you
would
take
no
action
that
was
the
doing
of
a
greek
as
was
established
say
can
you
of
your
own
experience
of
children
of
the
arabs
say
that
one
of
us
has
ever
robbed
you
of
a
small
para
or
wronged
you
seriously
can
not
was
my
answer
after
brief
reflection
the
experience
of
other
older
men
must
weigh
with
me
other
men
judge
people
as
they
find
them
and
do
thou
likewise
said
suleymân
urged
me
to
give
up
this
aimless
wandering
and
go
with
him
in
search
of
an
old
greek
inscription
not
far
off
within
four
days
he
hopes
to
see
el
cuds
again
and
thence
he
urged
me
to
return
to
england
at
that
my
two
companions
became
silent
and
exceeding
still
as
if
some
paralysing
fear
hung
over
them
it
was
the
hour
immediately
before
the
dawn
and
life
seemed
hopeless
the
missionary
voice
seemed
then
to
me
the
call
of
duty
yet
every
instinct
in
my
blood
was
fierce
against
it
honour
will
do
what
he
pleases
said
my
servant
mournfully
lord
preserve
thee
ever
sighed
suleymân
art
the
leader
of
the
party
give
command
a
streak
of
light
grew
on
the
far
horizon
enabling
us
to
see
the
outlines
of
the
rugged
landscape
a
cried
among
the
rocks
below
us
and
suddenly
my
mind
grew
clear
i
cared
no
longer
for
the
missionary
warning
i
was
content
to
face
the
dangers
which
those
warnings
threatened
to
be
contaminated
even
ruined
as
an
englishman
the
mischief
as
i
thought
it
was
already
done
i
knew
that
i
could
never
truly
think
as
did
that
missionary
nor
hold
myself
superior
to
eastern
folk
again
if
that
was
to
be
reprobate
then
i
was
finished
the
horses
we
will
start
at
once
i
told
rashîd
the
missionary
is
afoot
towards
the
east
for
a
moment
he
sat
motionless
unable
to
believe
his
ears
then
suddenly
he
swooped
and
kissed
my
hand
exclaiming
be
to
allah
be
to
allah
echoed
suleymân
with
vast
relief
tiger
in
thee
has
not
triumphed
we
shall
still
know
joy
resign
myself
to
be
the
pigeon
of
the
mosque
i
answered
laughing
happily
five
minutes
later
we
were
riding
towards
the
dawn
beginning
to
grow
red
behind
the
heights
of
moab
chapter
xi
the
knight
errant
we
had
left
damascus
after
noon
the
day
before
and
had
spent
the
night
at
a
great
the
first
of
many
on
the
road
we
had
been
on
our
way
an
hour
before
rashîd
discovered
that
he
had
left
a
pair
of
behind
him
at
the
khan
and
as
those
contained
belongings
of
suleymân
the
latter
went
back
with
him
to
retrieve
them
i
rode
on
slowly
looking
for
a
patch
of
shade
except
the
khan
a
square
black
object
in
the
distance
there
was
nothing
in
my
range
of
vision
to
project
a
shadow
larger
than
a
thistle
between
a
faint
blue
wave
of
mountains
on
the
one
hand
and
a
more
imposing
but
far
distant
range
upon
the
other
the
vast
plain
rolled
to
the
horizon
in
smooth
waves
i
was
ascending
such
an
undulation
at
my
horse
leisure
when
a
cavalier
appeared
upon
its
summit
a
figure
straight
out
of
the
pages
of
some
book
of
chivalry
with
coloured
mantle
streaming
to
the
breeze
and
lance
held
upright
in
the
this
knight
was
riding
at
his
ease
till
he
caught
sight
of
me
when
with
a
shout
he
laid
his
lance
in
rest
lowered
his
crest
and
charged
i
was
exceedingly
alarmed
having
no
skill
in
tournament
and
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
turn
and
flee
i
rode
on
as
before
though
with
a
beating
heart
my
purpose
if
i
had
one
being
when
the
moment
came
to
lean
aside
and
try
to
catch
his
spear
trusting
in
allah
that
my
horse
would
stand
the
shock
but
the
prospect
of
success
was
small
because
i
could
see
nothing
clearly
till
suddenly
the
thunder
of
the
ceased
and
i
beheld
the
knight
within
ten
yards
of
me
grinning
and
saluting
me
with
lance
erect
his
horse
flung
back
upon
its
haunches
frightened
thee
o
faranji
he
asserted
mockingly
i
replied
that
it
would
take
more
than
such
a
wretched
mountebank
as
he
could
do
to
frighten
me
and
showed
him
my
revolver
which
until
the
fear
was
over
had
escaped
my
memory
it
pleased
him
and
he
asked
for
it
immediately
i
put
it
back
pretty
weapon
he
agreed
still
i
frightened
thee
i
shrugged
and
sneered
disdaining
further
argument
and
thought
to
pass
him
but
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
beside
me
asking
who
i
was
and
where
i
came
from
and
what
might
be
my
earthly
object
in
riding
thus
towards
the
desert
all
alone
i
answered
all
his
questions
very
coldly
which
did
not
disconcert
him
in
the
least
hearing
that
i
had
attendants
one
of
whom
had
skill
in
warfare
he
said
that
he
would
wait
with
me
till
they
came
up
i
tried
to
frighten
him
with
tales
of
all
the
men
rashîd
had
slain
in
single
combat
he
was
all
the
more
determined
to
remain
with
me
saying
that
he
would
gain
much
honour
from
destroying
such
a
man
i
do
suspect
that
thou
are
lying
o
most
noble
faranji
and
that
this
boasted
champion
is
some
wretched
townsman
whose
only
courage
is
behind
a
wall
he
chuckled
at
that
i
was
indignant
and
i
lied
the
more
thus
talking
we
came
near
a
piece
of
ruined
wall
which
cast
sufficient
shadow
for
a
man
to
rest
in
the
knight
dismounted
and
tied
up
his
horse
i
was
for
riding
on
but
he
made
such
an
outcry
that
wishing
to
avoid
a
quarrel
i
alighted
also
and
tied
up
my
horse
we
lay
down
near
together
in
the
strip
of
shade
he
passed
me
a
rough
leathern
and
i
took
a
draught
of
warmish
fluid
tasting
like
the
smell
of
goats
he
took
a
longer
draught
and
then
exclaimed
are
thy
friends
far
off
upon
the
plain
two
specks
were
moving
i
could
not
have
told
man
from
man
at
such
a
distance
but
the
knight
was
able
to
distinguish
and
describe
them
accurately
younger
man
who
sits
erect
upon
his
horse
he
is
no
doubt
the
warrior
of
whom
thou
speakest
the
other
plump
and
lolling
has
the
air
of
greatness
a
pasha
maybe
or
a
man
of
law
i
told
him
that
suleymân
was
a
man
of
learning
and
then
let
him
talk
while
i
took
stock
of
his
appearance
the
figure
out
of
books
of
chivalry
was
shabby
on
a
close
inspection
the
coloured
surcoat
was
both
and
torn
the
coat
of
mail
beneath
so
ancient
that
many
of
the
links
had
disappeared
completely
the
holes
where
they
had
been
were
patched
with
hide
which
also
was
beginning
to
give
way
in
places
his
age
was
about
he
had
bright
brown
eyes
a
black
moustache
and
beard
and
a
malicious
air
he
looked
a
perfect
ragamuffin
yet
he
spoke
with
condescension
talking
much
about
his
pedigree
which
contained
a
host
of
names
which
i
had
never
heard
before
a
fact
which
when
he
realised
it
filled
him
first
with
horror
then
with
pity
of
my
ignorance
he
expatiated
also
on
his
horse
pedigree
which
was
as
lengthy
as
his
own
when
my
friends
came
up
i
quite
expected
them
to
rid
me
of
the
tiresome
knight
but
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
they
took
the
man
and
his
pretensions
seriously
exchanging
with
him
compliments
in
striking
contrast
with
the
haughty
tone
i
had
till
then
adopted
rashîd
refused
his
challenge
with
politeness
and
much
to
my
dismay
suleymân
the
older
and
more
thoughtful
man
accepted
it
upon
condition
that
the
combat
should
stand
over
till
some
more
convenient
time
and
when
the
knight
proclaimed
his
sovereign
will
to
travel
with
us
they
seemed
pleased
will
be
useful
to
us
said
rashîd
when
i
complained
to
him
of
this
deception
his
tribe
controls
a
great
part
of
this
country
but
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
carry
our
revolver
while
he
rides
with
us
then
i
and
not
your
honour
can
deny
him
which
is
more
becoming
the
knight
had
asked
for
my
revolver
thrice
already
that
evening
near
a
lonely
village
of
the
plain
the
battle
with
suleymân
was
fought
with
equal
honours
each
rider
hitting
his
man
squarely
with
the
long
jerideh
the
stripped
which
is
substituted
for
the
spear
in
friendly
combat
the
heroes
faced
each
other
at
a
regulated
distance
then
one
it
was
suleymân
clapped
spurs
into
his
horse
flanks
and
fled
keeping
within
a
certain
space
which
might
be
called
the
lists
the
other
flying
after
him
with
fearful
yells
intent
to
fling
the
missile
so
that
it
should
strike
the
victim
in
a
certain
manner
this
lasted
till
the
throw
was
made
and
then
the
order
was
reversed
and
the
pursuer
in
his
turn
became
the
hunted
the
knight
applauded
his
opponent
skill
reluctantly
and
with
regret
that
he
himself
had
not
been
in
his
usual
form
he
journeyed
with
us
after
that
for
many
days
it
seemed
that
he
was
out
in
search
of
exploits
so
did
not
care
a
jot
which
way
he
rode
in
former
days
he
told
me
there
used
to
be
a
tournament
in
every
town
each
friday
where
any
stranger
knight
might
show
his
prowess
winning
honour
and
renown
but
in
these
degenerate
times
it
was
necessary
for
the
champion
to
cry
his
challenge
in
some
public
place
or
else
arrange
the
fight
beforehand
meanly
in
some
tavern
i
should
have
been
delighted
with
him
on
the
whole
if
he
had
not
been
quarrelsome
and
had
not
expected
us
as
his
companions
to
extricate
him
from
the
strife
in
which
his
arrogance
involved
him
we
dreaded
the
arrival
at
a
town
or
village
if
he
had
possessed
the
prowess
of
his
courage
which
was
absolutely
reckless
he
would
have
been
a
more
endurable
if
dread
companion
but
in
almost
every
quarrel
which
he
brought
upon
himself
he
got
the
worst
of
it
and
was
severely
beaten
and
then
would
talk
to
us
about
the
honour
of
the
arabs
till
we
fell
asleep
one
night
in
the
small
town
of
mazarib
we
rescued
him
from
two
circassian
bravoes
whom
he
had
insulted
wantonly
they
had
nearly
stopped
his
mouth
for
ever
when
we
intervened
i
can
not
say
he
was
ungrateful
upon
that
occasion
on
the
contrary
he
swore
that
he
would
not
forsake
us
until
death
a
vow
which
filled
us
with
dismay
for
even
suleymân
by
that
time
saw
that
he
was
useless
and
rashîd
our
treasurer
resented
his
contempt
of
money
he
had
a
way
too
of
demanding
anything
of
ours
which
took
his
fancy
and
if
not
forcibly
prevented
taking
it
peculiarly
obnoxious
to
rashîd
who
idolised
my
few
belongings
we
were
his
friends
his
manner
told
us
and
he
the
bravest
of
the
brave
the
noblest
of
the
noble
arabs
was
prepared
to
give
his
life
for
us
at
any
time
any
trifles
therefore
which
we
might
bestow
on
him
were
really
nothing
as
compared
with
what
he
gave
us
every
hour
of
every
day
it
grew
unbearable
the
people
in
the
khan
at
mazarib
were
laughing
at
us
because
that
wretched
bedawi
a
chance
adherent
ruled
our
party
we
plotted
desperately
to
get
rid
of
him
at
length
suleymân
devised
a
scheme
it
was
that
we
should
change
the
whole
direction
of
our
journey
turning
aside
into
the
mountain
of
the
druzes
the
druzes
were
at
war
with
many
of
the
bedu
probably
with
this
man
tribe
at
any
rate
a
bedawi
unless
disguised
would
run
grave
risk
among
them
while
the
war
was
on
accordingly
when
we
at
length
set
out
from
mazarib
suleymân
with
many
compliments
informed
the
knight
of
a
dilemma
which
distressed
us
greatly
i
had
been
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
a
friend
of
mine
a
great
druze
sheykh
now
lying
very
ill
whose
one
wish
was
to
gaze
on
me
before
he
died
rashîd
chimed
in
to
say
how
tenderly
that
druze
chief
loved
me
and
how
depressed
i
was
by
sorrow
for
his
grievous
illness
in
short
it
was
imperative
that
we
should
go
at
once
to
the
druze
mountain
what
were
our
feelings
when
we
suddenly
bethought
us
that
there
was
danger
in
that
region
for
an
arab
knight
must
we
then
part
from
our
beloved
from
our
souls
companion
suleymân
declared
that
we
had
wept
like
babes
at
such
a
prospect
no
that
must
never
be
our
grief
would
kill
us
we
had
been
obliged
to
think
of
some
contrivance
by
which
our
hearts
delight
might
bear
us
company
without
much
risk
and
with
the
help
of
allah
we
had
hit
upon
a
splendid
plan
yet
simple
that
he
should
lay
aside
his
lance
and
armour
dress
as
a
christian
and
become
our
cook
need
he
seem
a
christian
asked
rashîd
all
cooks
who
go
with
english
travellers
are
christians
was
the
earnest
answer
because
no
man
would
ever
think
to
find
a
bedawi
beneath
a
christian
cloak
person
of
my
master
standing
ought
to
have
a
cook
murmured
rashîd
as
one
who
thought
aloud
never
have
i
seen
such
horror
in
the
face
of
man
as
then
convulsed
the
features
of
the
desert
knight
he
a
cook
he
the
descendant
of
i
know
not
whom
to
wear
the
semblance
of
a
heathen
and
degraded
townsman
rather
than
that
he
would
encounter
twenty
if
we
were
going
to
the
mountain
of
the
druzes
we
might
go
alone
we
all
were
eager
to
express
regret
he
listened
with
a
sneer
and
answered
nothing
after
a
while
he
beckoned
me
to
speak
apart
with
him
and
when
we
were
beyond
the
hearing
of
the
others
said
leave
thee
now
o
faranji
and
journey
towards
nejd
to
seek
adventures
thou
lovest
me
i
am
aware
and
so
i
grieve
to
part
from
thee
but
thy
adherents
are
low
people
and
devoured
by
envy
if
ever
we
should
meet
again
i
will
destroy
them
if
thou
shouldst
travel
south
and
eastward
through
the
belka
remember
me
i
beg
and
seek
our
tents
there
thou
shalt
find
a
welcome
far
more
hospitable
than
the
druze
will
give
thee
i
shall
never
cease
to
pray
for
thee
my
grief
will
be
extreme
until
we
meet
again
i
pray
thee
give
me
that
revolver
as
a
souvenir
chapter
xii
the
fanatic
a
european
hat
in
those
days
was
a
rarity
except
in
the
large
towns
and
it
attracted
notice
that
is
the
reason
why
i
generally
discarded
it
with
other
too
conspicuously
western
adjuncts
where
the
inhabitants
were
not
the
hat
was
apt
to
be
saluted
with
a
shower
of
stones
one
afternoon
i
happened
to
be
riding
by
myself
along
a
road
in
the
bare
mountain
country
round
jerusalem
wearing
a
hat
when
i
came
on
a
pedestrian
resting
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
by
the
wayside
he
was
a
native
christian
that
much
could
be
detected
at
a
glance
but
of
what
peculiar
brand
i
could
not
guess
from
his
costume
which
consisted
of
a
fez
a
clerical
black
coat
and
waistcoat
quite
of
english
cut
but
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
a
yellow
flannel
shirt
and
a
red
cord
with
tassels
worn
by
way
of
necktie
baggy
turkish
pantaloons
white
stockings
and
boots
beside
him
a
long
staff
leaned
up
against
the
rock
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
at
my
approach
and
with
an
amiable
smile
and
bow
exclaimed
afternoon
i
think
you
are
an
english
gentleman
i
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
and
he
asked
leave
to
walk
beside
me
until
past
a
certain
village
not
far
distant
of
which
the
people
he
assured
me
were
extremely
wicked
and
averse
to
christians
i
readily
consented
and
he
took
his
staff
and
walked
beside
me
pouring
out
his
soul
in
fulsome
flattery
the
village
which
he
dreaded
to
approach
alone
was
the
abode
of
muslims
devilish
people
who
hate
the
righteous
christians
and
persecute
them
when
they
get
the
chance
he
said
that
he
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
the
english
would
take
over
the
whole
country
and
put
those
in
their
proper
place
below
the
christians
it
would
be
a
mercy
and
a
blessing
to
the
human
race
he
gave
as
his
mature
opinion
if
the
english
were
to
conquer
the
whole
world
they
were
so
good
and
upright
and
so
truly
pious
he
did
not
think
that
any
wrong
was
ever
done
in
england
and
then
are
a
brûtestant
he
asked
i
answered
that
i
was
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
thank
god
he
cried
also
am
a
brûtestant
a
babtist
he
seemed
to
think
that
my
avowal
made
us
brothers
it
seemed
from
the
account
he
gave
me
of
himself
that
he
was
an
evangelist
working
to
spread
the
truth
among
his
wicked
for
the
christians
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
were
both
wicked
and
benighted
he
informed
me
and
would
persecute
him
like
the
muslims
if
they
got
the
chance
it
was
hard
work
he
told
me
turning
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
grieved
to
say
it
but
there
seemed
no
other
way
to
purge
the
land
of
all
those
wicked
people
save
destruction
he
wondered
that
the
lord
had
not
destroyed
them
long
ago
yet
when
i
said
that
i
did
not
agree
with
him
but
thought
that
they
were
decent
folk
though
rather
backward
he
came
round
to
my
opinion
in
a
trice
exclaiming
how
true
you
speak
it
is
that
they
are
backward
they
will
neffer
be
no
better
till
they
get
the
gosbel
light
the
liffin
water
i
told
him
he
was
talking
nonsense
that
for
my
part
i
thought
the
missionaries
did
more
harm
than
good
and
once
again
he
changed
his
standpoint
though
less
boldly
saying
is
so
delightful
to
talk
thus
freely
to
a
noble
english
gentleman
god
knows
that
i
could
listen
for
a
day
without
fatigue
you
talk
so
sweet
and
what
you
say
is
all
so
new
to
me
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
with
what
severity
the
english
missionaries
treated
native
converts
like
himself
mentioning
many
wicked
things
which
they
had
done
in
his
remembrance
i
could
not
but
admire
his
versatility
and
total
lack
of
shame
in
his
desire
to
please
thus
talking
we
approached
the
village
of
his
fears
i
was
by
myself
i
should
be
much
afraid
he
fawned
not
with
you
these
wicked
beoble
do
not
dare
to
hurt
an
english
gentleman
who
wears
the
hat
and
is
brotected
by
the
bowers
of
eurobe
we
had
not
really
got
into
the
place
before
some
boys
at
play
among
the
rocks
outside
the
houses
spying
my
hat
threw
stones
in
our
direction
one
hit
my
horse
i
raised
my
whip
and
rode
at
them
they
fled
with
screams
of
terror
glancing
back
i
could
perceive
no
sign
of
my
devout
companion
but
when
i
returned
at
leisure
having
driven
the
young
rogues
to
cover
i
found
him
vigorously
beating
a
small
boy
who
had
fallen
in
the
panic
flight
and
finding
himself
left
behind
had
been
too
frightened
to
get
up
again
never
have
i
seen
a
face
of
such
triumphant
malice
as
then
appeared
on
that
demure
evangelist
he
beat
the
child
as
if
he
meant
to
kill
it
muttering
execrations
all
the
while
and
looking
round
him
furtively
for
fear
lest
other
muslims
should
appear
in
sight
in
which
case
i
believe
he
would
at
once
have
turned
from
blows
to
fondling
wicked
boy
he
cried
as
i
came
up
throw
stones
at
a
noble
english
gentleman
he
well
deserfs
to
be
deliffered
ofer
to
the
bowers
of
eurobe
i
bade
him
leave
the
child
alone
or
it
would
be
the
worse
for
him
aggrieved
and
in
appearance
shocked
at
my
unsympathetic
tone
he
left
his
prey
and
i
endeavoured
to
speak
comfort
to
the
victim
who
however
took
no
notice
of
my
words
but
ran
hard
for
the
village
howling
lustily
wicked
boy
the
wicked
children
the
evangelist
kept
moaning
in
hesitating
and
tones
is
a
bity
that
you
let
him
go
he
will
perhabs
make
trouble
for
us
in
the
fillage
but
you
are
so
brafe
i
think
the
english
are
the
brafest
kind
of
beeble
i
also
thought
it
possible
there
might
be
trouble
but
i
decided
to
go
on
not
wishing
to
show
fear
before
that
craven
he
cried
aloud
in
awe
and
wonder
when
i
told
him
that
little
boys
threw
stones
in
christian
england
only
upon
unbelievers
he
exclaimed
imploringly
as
one
who
would
preserve
his
last
illusion
i
replied
to
the
effect
that
members
of
the
church
of
england
would
no
doubt
have
stoned
a
baptist
or
a
roman
catholic
with
pleasure
if
such
heretics
with
us
had
dressed
in
a
peculiar
way
but
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
only
natural
instinct
in
a
boy
to
throw
a
stone
at
any
living
thing
which
seemed
unusual
the
shock
this
information
gave
him
or
his
private
terrors
kept
him
silent
through
the
village
where
the
people
men
and
women
watched
us
pass
with
what
appeared
to
be
unfriendly
faces
i
was
ill
at
ease
expecting
some
attack
at
every
step
as
luck
would
have
it
at
the
far
end
of
the
place
when
i
could
see
the
open
country
and
was
giving
thanks
for
our
escape
a
great
big
stone
was
thrown
by
a
small
boy
quite
close
to
me
it
struck
me
on
the
arm
and
hurt
enough
to
make
me
really
angry
god
sake
sir
implored
my
terrified
companion
on
do
nothing
there
are
men
obserfing
i
heard
him
taking
to
his
heels
but
i
had
caught
the
culprit
and
was
beating
him
his
yells
went
forth
with
terrible
insistence
my
father
o
my
mother
help
ya
muslimin
and
in
a
trice
i
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
fellâhîn
one
of
whom
told
me
curtly
to
release
the
boy
i
did
so
instantly
prepared
for
trouble
but
no
sooner
had
i
left
off
beating
than
that
man
began
the
boy
appeals
for
help
went
forth
anew
but
this
time
he
addressed
them
to
his
mother
only
for
his
father
held
him
i
begged
the
man
to
stop
and
in
the
end
he
did
so
all
those
fellâhîn
returned
my
smile
at
this
conclusion
and
wished
me
a
good
evening
as
i
rode
away
i
never
saw
that
bright
evangelist
again
no
doubt
he
ran
till
he
had
reached
some
place
inhabited
by
altogether
righteous
christian
people
but
the
way
he
started
running
was
a
clear
inducement
to
pursuit
to
any
son
of
adam
not
evangelised
chapter
xiii
rashîd
revenge
we
were
staying
with
an
english
friend
of
mine
a
parson
though
the
least
parsonical
of
men
who
had
a
pleasant
little
house
in
a
druze
village
of
mount
lebanon
and
nothing
to
do
but
watch
and
do
his
utmost
to
restrain
the
antics
of
a
very
wealthy
and
eccentric
lady
missionary
he
had
gone
away
for
a
few
weeks
leaving
us
in
possession
when
another
sort
of
clergyman
arrived
a
little
man
with
long
white
beard
sharp
nose
and
pale
seraphic
eyes
he
was
or
fancied
that
he
was
on
duty
inspecting
missionary
establishments
in
those
mountains
the
master
of
the
house
had
once
invited
him
to
stay
there
if
he
passed
that
way
he
seemed
surprised
to
find
us
in
possession
and
treated
us
as
interlopers
though
i
was
in
fact
his
host
regarding
our
small
dwelling
as
a
clergy
house
his
gaze
expressed
an
innocent
surprise
when
i
sat
down
to
supper
with
him
and
performed
the
honours
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
he
gave
his
orders
boldly
to
my
servant
and
his
demeanour
plainly
asked
what
business
i
had
there
though
he
would
never
listen
to
my
explanation
i
took
the
whole
adventure
philosophically
but
rage
and
indignation
took
possession
of
rashîd
and
his
indignation
was
increased
by
the
popularity
of
our
insulter
with
the
girls
and
teachers
of
the
hard
by
our
guest
was
innocence
itself
if
silly
and
conceited
but
rashîd
watched
all
his
movements
and
could
tell
me
that
the
old
as
he
invariably
called
him
went
to
the
school
each
day
and
kissed
the
pupils
taking
the
pretty
ones
upon
his
knee
and
making
foolish
jokes
talking
and
giggling
like
an
imbecile
bestowing
sweetmeats
with
them
for
the
most
sinful
motives
as
rashîd
averred
and
i
suppose
believed
he
was
all
sugar
but
when
he
came
back
to
the
house
he
was
as
grumpy
as
could
be
rashîd
would
have
destroyed
him
at
a
nod
from
me
one
evening
when
he
said
think
i
must
have
left
my
glasses
over
at
the
school
will
you
be
good
enough
to
go
and
ask
your
honour
knows
how
we
feel
when
we
meet
a
man
like
that
and
there
are
many
such
among
the
franks
my
servant
whispered
in
my
ear
as
i
went
out
obediently
allah
it
is
not
to
be
endured
the
parson
occupied
the
only
bedroom
and
i
slept
out
upon
the
balcony
on
his
account
yet
he
complained
of
certain
of
my
garments
hanging
in
his
room
and
flung
them
out
it
was
after
that
revolting
episode
when
i
was
really
angry
for
a
moment
that
rashîd
came
to
me
and
said
hate
this
hypocrite
is
it
not
so
allah
i
replied
hate
him
he
seemed
relieved
by
the
decision
of
my
tone
and
then
informed
me
know
a
person
who
would
kill
him
for
the
sake
of
thirty
english
pounds
it
became
of
course
incumbent
on
me
to
explain
that
with
us
english
hatred
is
not
absolute
as
with
the
children
of
the
arabs
mine
had
already
reached
the
laughing
stage
he
was
evidently
disappointed
and
answered
with
a
weary
sigh
allah
rid
us
of
this
foul
oppression
it
was
a
bitter
pill
for
him
whose
whole
endeavour
was
for
my
aggrandisement
to
see
me
treated
like
a
menial
by
our
guest
who
one
fine
evening
had
me
summoned
to
his
presence
i
had
been
sitting
with
some
village
elders
in
the
olive
grove
behind
the
house
and
made
to
me
a
strange
proposal
which
rashîd
declared
by
allah
proved
his
perfect
infamy
his
manner
was
for
once
quite
amiable
leaning
back
in
a
his
two
hands
with
palms
resting
on
his
waistcoat
the
fingers
raised
communicating
at
the
tips
he
said
with
clerical
complacency
is
my
purpose
to
make
a
little
tour
to
visit
missionary
ladies
at
three
several
places
in
these
mountains
and
then
to
go
on
to
jezzîn
to
see
the
waterfall
as
you
appear
to
know
the
country
and
the
people
intimately
and
can
speak
the
language
it
would
be
well
if
you
came
too
the
man
rashîd
could
wait
upon
us
all
rashîd
i
knew
was
listening
at
the
door
all
how
many
of
you
are
there
then
he
hemmed
a
moment
ere
replying
er
think
of
taking
the
miss
karams
with
me
miss
sara
karam
a
young
lady
of
syrian
birth
but
english
education
was
head
teacher
at
the
girls
school
and
her
younger
sister
miss
habîbah
karam
was
her
constant
visitor
thought
you
might
take
charge
of
the
younger
of
the
two
the
trip
will
give
them
both
great
pleasure
i
am
sure
and
they
were
going
to
jezzîn
where
there
was
no
hotel
and
we
should
have
to
herd
together
in
the
village
what
would
my
arab
friends
censorious
in
all
such
matters
think
of
that
i
told
him
plainly
what
i
thought
of
the
idea
and
what
the
would
think
of
it
and
all
of
us
i
told
him
that
i
had
no
wish
to
ruin
any
woman
reputation
nor
to
be
forced
into
unhappy
marriage
by
a
public
scandal
he
as
a
visitor
would
go
away
again
as
an
old
man
and
professionally
holy
his
good
name
could
hardly
suffer
among
english
people
but
the
girls
would
have
to
live
among
the
mountaineers
who
knowing
of
their
escapade
would
thenceforth
scorn
them
and
as
for
me
i
proposed
a
mere
excursion
he
interpolated
fail
to
see
why
you
should
take
this
tone
about
it
i
have
told
you
what
i
think
was
my
rejoinder
i
then
went
out
and
told
the
story
to
rashîd
who
heartily
applauded
my
decision
which
he
had
already
gathered
i
did
not
see
our
simple
friend
again
till
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
then
he
said
to
me
in
something
of
a
contrite
tone
have
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
last
night
i
confess
i
had
not
thought
about
the
native
gossip
i
have
decided
to
give
up
the
expedition
to
jezzîn
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
as
you
are
not
going
i
could
ride
your
horse
it
would
save
the
trouble
and
expense
of
hiring
one
if
you
would
kindly
lend
it
taken
fairly
by
surprise
i
answered
and
then
went
out
and
told
rashîd
what
i
had
done
he
wrung
his
hands
and
bitterly
reproached
me
there
is
one
good
thing
he
said
will
kill
him
in
all
the
months
that
we
had
owned
that
horse
rashîd
had
never
once
before
alluded
to
him
by
the
name
which
i
had
chosen
it
was
he
had
often
warned
me
but
nothing
could
be
too
for
that
hypocrite
do
not
want
to
lend
the
horse
at
all
i
said
i
am
pretty
sure
he
could
not
ride
him
but
what
was
i
to
say
he
took
me
by
surprise
that
case
said
rashîd
is
not
said
our
darling
shall
enjoy
his
bath
the
washing
of
my
horse
a
arab
stallion
as
playful
as
a
kitten
and
as
mad
was
in
the
nature
of
a
public
festival
for
all
the
neighbours
sheytân
was
led
down
to
the
spring
where
all
the
population
gathered
the
bravest
throwing
water
over
him
with
kerosene
tins
while
he
plunged
and
kicked
and
roused
the
mountain
echoes
with
his
naughty
screaming
on
this
occasion
for
a
finish
rashîd
let
go
his
hold
upon
the
the
people
fled
in
all
directions
and
off
went
our
sheytân
with
tail
erect
scrambling
and
careering
up
the
terraces
as
nimble
as
a
goat
to
take
the
air
before
returning
to
his
stable
our
reverend
guest
had
watched
the
whole
performance
from
our
balcony
which
from
a
height
of
some
three
hundred
feet
looked
down
upon
the
spring
i
was
up
there
behind
him
but
i
said
no
word
till
he
exclaimed
in
pious
horror
a
vicious
brute
dangerous
ought
to
be
shot
when
i
inquired
to
what
he
was
alluding
is
that
savage
beast
he
asked
with
quite
vindictive
ire
pointing
to
sheytân
who
was
disporting
on
the
terrace
just
below
that
my
horse
i
answered
interested
really
quite
a
lamb
horse
you
do
mean
that
he
said
no
more
just
then
but
went
indoors
and
then
out
to
the
mission
school
to
see
the
ladies
that
evening
he
informed
me
shall
not
require
your
horse
i
had
no
notion
that
it
was
so
strong
an
animal
when
i
suggested
borrowing
it
old
câsim
at
the
school
will
hire
one
for
me
i
should
be
afraid
lest
such
a
valuable
horse
as
yours
might
come
to
grief
while
in
my
charge
that
was
his
way
of
putting
it
we
watched
the
party
start
one
early
morning
the
clergyman
all
smiles
the
ladies
in
a
flutter
all
three
mounted
on
hired
chargers
of
the
most
dejected
type
old
câsim
from
the
school
attending
them
upon
a
jackass
rashîd
addressed
the
as
he
passed
our
house
applying
a
disgraceful
epithet
to
his
employment
the
poor
old
creature
wept
knows
he
said
would
not
choose
such
service
but
what
am
i
to
do
a
man
must
live
and
i
will
save
my
lady
virtue
if
i
can
allah
help
thee
said
rashîd
courage
i
have
robbed
his
eyes
i
had
no
notion
of
his
meaning
at
the
time
when
sitting
on
the
balcony
i
overheard
this
dialogue
but
later
in
the
day
rashîd
revealed
to
me
two
pairs
of
eyeglasses
belonging
to
our
guest
without
these
glasses
which
were
of
especial
power
the
reverend
man
could
not
see
anything
in
detail
these
two
pairs
were
all
he
had
exclaimed
rashîd
with
triumph
always
used
to
put
them
on
when
looking
amorously
at
the
ladies
the
loss
of
them
please
god
will
spoil
his
pleasure
chapter
xiv
the
hanging
dog
our
english
host
possessed
a
spaniel
bitch
which
being
gave
him
much
anxiety
the
fear
of
mésalliances
was
ever
in
his
mind
and
furiously
would
he
drive
away
the
village
pariahs
when
they
came
slinking
round
the
house
with
lolling
tongues
one
brown
and
white
dog
larger
than
the
others
and
with
bristling
hair
was
a
particular
aversion
the
thought
of
which
deprived
him
of
his
sleep
of
nights
and
not
the
thought
alone
for
that
persistent
suitor
more
like
a
bear
than
any
dog
i
ever
saw
made
a
great
noise
around
us
in
the
darkness
whining
howling
and
even
scrabbling
at
the
stable
door
at
length
in
desperation
he
resolved
to
kill
him
one
night
when
all
the
village
was
asleep
we
lay
out
on
the
balcony
with
guns
and
waited
after
a
while
the
shadow
of
a
dog
slinking
among
the
olive
trees
was
seen
we
fired
the
village
and
the
mountains
echoed
fowls
clucked
dogs
barked
we
even
fancied
that
we
heard
the
cries
of
men
we
expected
the
whole
commune
to
rise
up
against
us
but
after
a
short
time
of
waiting
all
was
still
again
rashîd
out
in
the
shadows
whispered
is
nice
and
fat
as
if
he
thought
that
we
were
going
to
eat
the
dog
is
he
dead
i
asked
dead
was
the
reply
get
a
cord
and
hang
him
to
the
balcony
said
my
companion
odour
will
perhaps
attract
the
foxes
another
minute
and
the
corpse
was
hanging
from
the
balcony
while
we
lay
out
and
waited
talking
in
low
tones
the
bark
of
foxes
came
from
vineyards
near
at
hand
where
there
were
unripe
grapes
vines
have
tender
grapes
our
host
repeated
making
me
think
of
the
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
grapes
which
i
related
to
rashîd
in
arabic
as
best
i
could
he
laughed
as
he
exclaimed
grapes
thou
sayest
our
foxes
do
not
love
ripe
grapes
and
seldom
steal
them
i
assure
you
it
was
sour
grapes
that
the
villain
wanted
and
never
did
they
seem
so
exquisitely
sour
as
when
he
found
out
that
he
could
not
reach
them
how
his
poor
mouth
watered
this
was
new
light
upon
an
ancient
theme
for
us
his
hearers
after
an
hour
or
two
of
idle
waiting
when
no
foxes
came
we
went
to
bed
forgetting
all
about
the
hanging
dog
the
house
was
close
beside
a
carriage
road
which
leads
down
from
the
chief
town
of
the
mountains
to
the
city
passing
many
villages
as
it
was
summer
when
the
wealthy
citizens
sleep
in
the
mountain
villages
for
coolness
sake
from
the
dawn
onward
there
was
a
downward
stream
of
carriages
along
that
road
when
the
daylight
became
strong
enough
for
men
to
see
distinctly
the
sight
of
a
great
brown
and
white
dog
hanging
from
our
balcony
and
slowly
turning
struck
terror
in
the
breasts
of
was
it
a
sign
of
war
or
some
enchantment
carriage
after
carriage
stopped
while
its
inhabitants
attempted
to
explore
the
mystery
but
there
was
nobody
about
to
answer
questions
my
host
and
i
rashîd
as
well
were
fast
asleep
indoors
inquirers
looked
around
them
on
the
ground
and
then
up
at
the
shuttered
house
and
then
at
the
surrounding
olive
trees
in
one
of
which
they
finally
espied
a
nest
of
bedding
on
which
reclined
a
man
asleep
it
was
the
cook
amîn
who
slept
there
for
fresh
air
the
firing
of
the
night
before
had
not
disturbed
him
by
dint
of
throwing
stones
they
woke
him
up
and
he
descended
from
his
tree
and
stood
before
them
knuckling
his
eyes
which
were
still
full
of
sleep
they
asked
means
this
portent
of
the
hanging
dog
he
stared
incredulously
at
the
object
of
their
wonder
then
exclaimed
enemy
has
done
it
to
insult
me
while
i
slept
no
matter
i
will
be
avenged
before
the
day
is
out
the
tidings
of
the
mystery
ran
through
the
village
and
every
person
came
to
view
it
and
express
opinions
dog
is
well
known
he
is
called
barûd
he
was
the
finest
in
our
village
he
used
to
guard
the
dwelling
of
sheykh
ali
till
he
transferred
his
pleasure
to
the
house
of
sheykh
selîm
it
was
a
sin
to
kill
him
was
the
general
verdict
and
amîn
confirmed
it
saying
a
filthy
sin
but
i
will
be
avenged
before
the
day
is
out
at
last
rashîd
awakened
by
the
noise
of
talking
came
out
of
the
stable
where
he
always
slept
and
with
a
laugh
explained
the
whole
occurrence
some
of
the
villagers
were
greatly
shocked
and
blamed
us
strongly
but
rashîd
stood
up
for
us
declaring
that
the
dog
belonged
in
truth
to
no
man
so
that
no
man
living
had
the
right
to
blame
his
murderer
whereas
the
valuable
sporting
bitch
of
the
casîs
our
host
was
all
his
own
and
it
was
his
duty
therefore
to
defend
her
from
improper
lovers
he
then
cut
down
the
body
of
the
dog
which
no
one
up
till
then
had
dared
to
do
and
all
the
people
gradually
went
away
the
coast
was
clear
when
we
arose
towards
eight
rashîd
with
laughter
told
the
tale
to
us
at
breakfast
we
had
been
silly
we
agreed
to
leave
the
hanging
dog
and
there
as
we
supposed
the
matter
ended
but
hardly
had
we
finished
breakfast
when
a
knock
came
at
the
open
door
and
we
beheld
a
tall
and
dignified
fellâh
depositing
his
staff
against
the
doorpost
and
shuffling
off
his
slippers
at
the
call
to
enter
he
said
the
murdered
dog
was
his
and
dear
to
him
as
his
own
eyes
his
wife
and
children
he
was
the
finest
dog
in
all
the
village
of
so
rare
a
breed
that
no
one
in
the
world
had
seen
a
dog
just
like
him
he
had
been
of
use
to
guard
the
house
and
for
all
kinds
of
work
the
fellâh
declared
his
worth
to
be
five
turkish
pounds
which
we
must
pay
immediately
unless
we
wished
our
crime
to
be
reported
to
the
government
with
as
nonchalant
an
air
as
i
could
muster
i
offered
him
a
beshlik
fourpence
halfpenny
he
thereupon
became
abusive
and
withdrew
in
the
end
hurriedly
because
rashîd
approached
him
in
a
hostile
manner
he
had
not
been
gone
ten
minutes
when
another
peasant
came
asserting
that
the
dog
was
really
his
and
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
regaining
his
possession
by
arbitration
of
the
neighbours
when
we
shot
the
animal
he
thus
considered
himself
doubly
injured
in
his
expectations
and
his
property
he
came
to
ask
us
instantly
to
pay
an
english
pound
or
he
would
lay
the
case
before
the
turkish
governor
with
whom
he
could
assure
us
he
had
favour
i
offered
him
the
beshlik
and
he
also
stalked
off
in
a
rage
we
were
still
discussing
these
encounters
with
rashîd
when
there
arrived
a
vastly
more
imposing
personage
no
other
than
the
headman
of
the
village
the
correct
sheykh
mustafa
who
had
heard
he
said
of
the
infamous
attempts
which
had
been
made
to
levy
blackmail
on
us
and
came
now
in
all
haste
to
tell
us
of
the
indignation
and
disgust
which
such
dishonesty
towards
foreigners
aroused
in
him
he
could
assure
us
that
the
dog
was
really
his
and
he
was
glad
that
we
had
shot
the
creature
since
to
shoot
it
gave
us
pleasure
his
one
desire
was
that
we
should
enjoy
ourselves
since
our
delight
was
in
the
slaughter
of
domestic
animals
he
proposed
to
bring
his
mare
of
the
best
blood
of
the
desert
round
for
us
to
shoot
we
felt
exceedingly
ashamed
and
muttered
what
we
could
by
way
of
an
apology
but
the
sheykh
would
not
accept
it
from
us
gravely
smiling
and
stroking
his
grey
beard
he
said
do
what
pleases
you
god
knows
your
pleasure
is
a
law
to
us
nay
speak
the
word
and
almost
god
forgive
me
i
would
bring
my
little
son
for
you
to
shoot
so
unlimited
is
my
regard
for
men
so
much
above
the
common
rules
of
this
our
county
and
who
are
protected
in
their
every
fancy
by
the
powers
of
europe
his
flattery
dejected
us
for
many
days
chapter
xv
tigers
the
fellâhîn
who
came
to
gossip
in
the
winter
evenings
round
our
lamp
and
stove
assured
us
there
were
tigers
in
the
neighbouring
mountain
we
of
course
did
not
accept
the
statement
literally
but
our
english
friend
possessed
the
killing
instinct
and
held
that
any
feline
creatures
which
could
masquerade
in
popular
report
as
tigers
would
afford
him
better
sport
than
he
had
yet
enjoyed
in
syria
so
when
the
settled
weather
came
we
went
to
look
for
them
for
my
part
i
take
pleasure
in
long
expeditions
with
a
gun
though
nothing
in
the
way
of
slaughter
come
of
them
my
lack
of
keenness
at
the
proper
moment
has
been
the
scorn
and
the
despair
of
native
guides
and
hunters
once
in
egypt
at
the
inundation
of
the
nile
i
had
been
rowed
for
miles
by
eager
men
and
had
lain
out
an
hour
upon
an
islet
among
reeds
only
to
forget
to
fire
when
my
adherents
whispered
as
the
duck
flew
over
because
the
sun
was
rising
and
the
desert
hills
were
blushing
like
the
rose
against
a
starry
sky
i
had
chased
a
solitary
partridge
a
whole
day
among
the
rocks
of
without
the
slightest
prospect
of
success
and
in
the
jordan
valley
i
had
endured
great
hardships
in
pursuit
of
wild
boar
without
seeing
one
it
was
the
lurking
in
wild
places
at
unusual
hours
which
pleased
me
not
the
matching
of
my
strength
and
skill
against
the
might
of
beasts
i
have
always
been
averse
to
every
sort
of
competition
this
i
explain
that
all
may
know
that
though
i
sallied
forth
with
glee
in
search
of
savage
creatures
it
was
not
to
kill
them
we
set
out
from
our
village
on
a
fine
spring
morning
attended
by
rashîd
my
servant
and
a
famous
hunter
of
the
district
named
muhammad
also
two
mules
which
carried
all
things
necessary
for
our
camping
out
and
were
in
charge
of
my
friend
cook
amîn
by
name
we
rode
into
the
mountains
making
for
the
central
range
of
barren
heights
which
had
the
hue
and
something
of
the
contour
of
a
back
at
length
we
reached
a
village
at
the
foot
of
this
commanding
range
and
asked
for
tigers
we
were
told
that
they
were
farther
on
a
man
came
with
us
to
a
point
of
vantage
whence
he
was
able
to
point
out
the
very
place
a
crag
in
the
far
distance
floating
in
a
haze
of
heat
after
riding
for
a
day
and
a
half
we
came
right
under
it
and
at
a
village
near
its
base
renewed
inquiry
we
were
told
tigers
are
much
farther
on
you
see
that
eminence
again
a
mountain
afar
off
was
indicated
at
the
next
village
we
encamped
for
night
drew
near
the
people
came
out
to
inspect
us
and
we
asked
them
for
the
tigers
they
cried
is
not
here
that
you
must
seek
them
by
allah
you
are
going
in
the
wrong
direction
behold
that
distant
peak
and
they
pointed
to
the
place
from
which
we
had
originally
started
our
english
friend
was
much
annoyed
rashîd
and
the
shikâri
and
the
cook
laughed
heartily
no
one
however
was
for
going
back
upon
the
following
day
our
friend
destroyed
a
jackal
and
two
conies
which
consoled
him
somewhat
in
the
dearth
of
tigers
and
we
rode
forward
resolutely
asking
our
question
at
each
village
as
we
went
along
everywhere
we
were
assured
that
there
were
really
tigers
in
the
mountain
and
from
some
of
the
villages
young
sportsmen
who
owned
guns
insisted
upon
joining
our
excursion
which
showed
that
they
themselves
believed
such
game
existed
but
their
adherence
though
it
gave
us
hope
was
tiresome
for
they
smoked
our
cigarettes
and
ate
our
food
at
last
towards
sunset
on
the
seventh
evening
of
our
expedition
we
saw
a
village
on
the
heights
with
no
trees
near
it
and
only
meagre
strips
of
cultivation
on
little
terraces
like
ledges
of
the
slope
below
our
friend
had
just
been
telling
me
that
he
was
weary
of
this
chase
with
all
the
rascals
upon
earth
adhering
to
us
he
did
not
now
believe
that
there
were
tigers
in
the
mountain
nor
did
i
and
we
had
quite
agreed
to
start
for
home
upon
the
morrow
when
the
people
of
that
miserable
village
galloped
down
to
greet
us
with
delighted
shouts
as
if
they
had
been
waiting
for
us
all
their
lives
is
your
will
inquired
the
elders
of
the
place
obsequiously
was
our
reply
o
old
man
are
there
any
tigers
in
your
neighbourhood
the
old
man
flung
up
both
his
hands
to
heaven
and
his
face
became
transfigured
as
in
ecstasy
he
shouted
it
tigers
you
desire
this
then
is
the
place
where
you
will
dwell
content
tigers
i
should
think
so
tigers
everywhere
the
elders
pointed
confidently
to
the
heights
and
men
and
women
even
children
told
us
by
allah
hundreds
thousands
of
them
not
just
one
or
two
as
many
as
the
most
capacious
man
could
possibly
devour
in
forty
years
looks
as
if
we
happened
right
at
last
our
friend
said
smiling
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
we
pitched
our
tent
upon
the
village
the
only
flat
place
except
roofs
of
houses
within
sight
the
village
elders
dined
with
us
and
stayed
till
nearly
midnight
telling
us
about
the
tigers
and
the
way
to
catch
them
some
of
the
stories
they
related
were
incredible
but
not
much
more
so
than
is
usual
in
that
kind
of
narrative
it
seemed
unnecessary
for
one
old
man
to
warn
us
gravely
on
no
account
to
take
them
by
their
tails
snakes
it
is
the
proper
way
he
said
sagaciously
snakes
can
only
double
half
their
length
but
tigers
double
their
whole
length
and
they
object
to
it
to
every
creature
its
own
proper
treatment
but
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
our
instructors
nor
of
their
eagerness
to
be
of
use
to
us
in
any
way
next
morning
when
we
started
out
the
headman
came
with
us
some
distance
on
purpose
to
instruct
the
guide
he
had
assigned
to
us
a
youth
who
seemed
afraid
he
told
him
first
over
there
among
the
boulders
and
when
you
have
exhausted
that
resort
go
down
to
the
ravine
and
thence
beat
upwards
to
the
please
god
your
honours
will
return
with
half
a
hundred
of
those
tigers
which
devour
our
crops
thus
sped
with
hope
we
set
out
in
good
spirits
expecting
not
a
bag
of
fifty
tigers
to
speak
truly
but
the
final
settlement
of
a
dispute
which
had
long
raged
among
us
as
to
what
those
famous
tigers
really
were
rashîd
would
have
it
they
were
leopards
i
said
lynxes
and
our
english
friend
in
moments
of
depression
thought
of
polecats
but
though
we
scoured
the
mountain
all
that
day
advancing
with
the
utmost
caution
and
in
open
order
as
our
guide
enjoined
we
saw
no
creature
of
the
feline
tribe
lizards
basking
motionless
upon
the
rocks
slid
off
like
lightning
when
aware
of
our
approach
two
splendid
eagles
from
an
eyrie
on
the
crags
above
hovered
and
wheeled
observing
us
their
shadows
like
two
moving
spots
of
ink
upon
the
a
drowsy
owl
was
put
up
from
a
cave
and
one
of
our
adherents
swore
he
heard
a
partridge
calling
no
other
living
creature
larger
than
a
beetle
did
we
come
across
that
day
returning
to
the
camp
at
evening
out
of
temper
we
were
met
by
all
the
village
headed
by
the
sheykh
who
loudly
hoped
that
we
had
had
good
sport
and
brought
home
many
tigers
to
provide
a
feast
when
he
heard
that
we
had
not
so
much
as
seen
a
single
one
he
fell
upon
the
luckless
youth
who
had
been
told
off
to
conduct
us
and
would
have
slain
him
i
believe
had
we
not
intervened
seek
in
all
the
haunts
whereof
i
told
thee
well
i
know
thou
didst
not
since
they
saw
no
tiger
behold
our
faces
blackened
through
thy
sloth
and
folly
o
abandoned
beast
restrained
by
force
by
two
of
our
adherents
the
sheykh
spat
venomously
at
the
weeping
guide
who
swore
by
allah
that
he
had
obeyed
instructions
to
the
letter
our
english
friend
was
much
too
angry
to
talk
arabic
he
bade
me
tell
the
sheykh
he
was
a
liar
and
that
the
country
was
as
bare
of
tigers
as
his
soul
of
truth
some
of
our
fellâh
adherents
seconded
my
speech
the
sheykh
appeared
amazed
and
greatly
horrified
are
tigers
he
assured
us
all
that
you
desire
go
and
find
them
for
us
said
our
friend
vindictively
my
head
replied
the
complaisant
old
man
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
turban
reverently
hear
is
to
obey
we
regarded
this
reply
as
mere
politeness
the
affair
as
ended
what
was
our
surprise
next
morning
to
see
the
sheykh
and
all
the
able
men
accompanied
by
many
children
set
off
up
the
mountain
armed
with
staves
and
scimitars
and
all
the
antique
armament
the
village
boasted
it
had
been
our
purpose
to
depart
that
day
but
we
remained
to
watch
the
outcome
of
that
wondrous
hunting
the
villagers
spread
out
and
the
mountain
all
day
long
we
heard
their
shouts
far
off
among
the
upper
heights
if
any
tiger
had
been
there
they
must
assuredly
have
roused
him
but
they
returned
at
evening
and
as
truly
crestfallen
as
if
they
had
indeed
expected
to
bring
home
a
bag
of
fifty
tigers
one
man
presented
me
with
a

owl
the

i
think
which
we
had
startled
on
the
day
before
as
if
to
show
that
their
display
had
not
been
quite
in

the
sheykh
as
though
his
heart
were
broken

have
caused
them
all
to
go
away
unhappy
day
a
lamentable
wail
went
up
from
the
whole

grievous
disappointment

the
world
is
thus

pride
and
a
fall
there
was
to
be
a
grand
fantasia
at
the
castle
of
the
greatest
of
druze
sheykhs
in
honour
of
a
visit
from
the
english
in
syria
and
as
an
englishman
i
was
invited
to
be
there
it
was
a
journey
of
a
day
and
a
half
upon
the
second
morning
rashîd
and
i
had
not
gone
far
ere
we
fell
in
with
other
horsemen
wending
in
the
same
direction
as
ourselves
well
mounted
and
in
holiday
attire
all
greeted
us
politely
but
we
kept
apart
because
they
nearly
all
rode
mares
while
we
rode
stallions
a
fruitful
source
of
trouble
and
a
cause
of
war
at
length
a
young
man
mounted
on
a
stallion
overtook
us
with
most
cordial
greetings
i
had
met
him
often
he
was
the
son
of
a
rich
landowner
in
a
neighbouring
valley
and
i
think
the
most
beautiful
human
creature
i
ever
saw
that
day
he
was
particularly
good
to
look
at
his
complexion
of
clear
olive
slightly
flushed
his
violet
eyes
beneath
their
long
dark
lashes
dancing
his
perfect
white
teeth
gleaming
with
excitement
and
delight
he
wore
a
cloak
broad
striped
of
white
and
crimson
a
white
frilled
shirt
of
lawn
showing
above
a
vest
of
crimson
velvet
baggy
trousers
and
soft
sheepskin
boots
a
turban
crowned
his
whole
appearance
his
horse
was
thoroughbred
and
young
and
he
controlled
its
ceaseless
dance
to
admiration
he
told
me
that
the
stallion
was
his
own
an
uncle
gift
and
quite
the
best
in
all
the
mountains
although
mine
he
added
out
of
mere
politeness
was
undoubtedly
a
pearl
of
breeding
and
high
spirit
he
hoped
with
such
a
steed
to
gain
renown
in
that
day
horsemanship
and
if
it
might
be
win
the
notice
of
the
and
his
lady
father
wished
me
to
take
out
another
horse
he
said
i
love
this
one
and
am
used
to
all
his
ways
i
could
not
do
myself
full
justice
on
another
nor
would
rustem
do
his
best
for
any
other
rider
he
proceeded
to
discuss
the
horses
which
we
saw
before
us
on
the
road
pointing
out
in
each
of
them
some
defect
and
exclaiming
shall
excel
them
all
in
sh
allah
does
not
your
honour
also
think
my
horse
the
best
i
assured
him
that
i
did
indeed
and
all
my
wishes
were
for
his
success
said
i
know
and
like
you
and
i
do
not
know
the
others
some
thou
knowest
for
a
certainty
for
all
the
mountain
will
be
there
come
let
me
name
them
to
thee
one
by
one
and
some
of
those
he
named
were
certainly
well
known
to
me
thou
seest
hasan
son
of
ali
nicely
mounted
wilt
thou
not
think
he
is
the
better
man
no
by
allah
i
disclaimed
such
fickleness
sure
that
if
good
wishes
can
ensure
success
all
mine
are
with
thee
in
event
increase
thy
wealth
he
cried
in
joy
as
if
i
had
bestowed
on
him
a
gift
of
price
there
was
a
crowd
of
many
colours
on
the
road
which
wanders
up
through
orchards
to
the
village
and
ends
on
the
meydân
before
the
castle
gate
there
the
crowd
halted
making
fast
their
horses
to
the
many
rings
and
which
were
in
the
walls
rashîd
took
charge
of
my
horse
and
his
own
while
i
went
on
up
steps
on
to
a
higher
platform
intersected
by
a
stream
of
water
plunging
down
into
the
valley
in
a
fine
cascade
whose
spray
and
murmur
cooled
the
air
that
rush
of
water
was
the
greatest
luxury
in
such
a
land
and
the
lord
of
the
castle
took
much
pride
in
its
contrivance
i
went
up
to
a
door
where
soldiers
and
domestics
lounged
but
was
informed
lord
is
out
of
doors
a
soldier
pointed
to
a
bunch
of
trees
above
the
waterfall
and
overlooking
the
meydân
where
many
notables
in
black
frock
coat
and
fez
sat
out
on
chairs
he
ran
on
to
announce
my
coming
i
was
soon
a
member
of
the
formal
group
replying
to
the
usual
compliments
and
kind
inquiries
coffee
was
handed
round
then
came
a
tray
of
different
kinds
of
sherbet
then
a
tray
of
eatables
the
chiefs
around
me
talked
of
harvests
and
the
price
of
land
but
most
of
all
of
horses
since
it
was
a
horsey
day
the
screaming
of
a
stallion
came
persistently
from
the
meydân
a
naughty
screaming
which
foreboded
mischief
i
recognised
the
voice
the
culprit
was
my
own
sheytân
the
screams
were
so
disturbing
so
indecent
that
several
of
the
great
ones
round
me
frowned
and
asked
horse
is
that
in
accents
of
displeasure
i
was
ashamed
to
own
him
at
length
the
lord
of
the
castle
called
a
servant
to
his
side
and
whispered
pointing
with
his
hand
in
the
direction
whence
the
screams
proceeded
the
servant
hurried
off
but
presently
returned
and
whispered
something
in
his
master
ear
his
master
looked
at
me
and
nodded
gravely
he
then
addressed
me
in
a
deprecating
tone
remarking
honour
horse
is
too
the
crowd
excites
him
will
you
allow
him
to
be
tethered
in
some
other
place
from
the
excessive
smoothness
of
his
manner
i
could
guess
that
had
i
been
a
native
of
the
land
he
would
have
told
me
to
remove
the
vicious
brute
and
myself
likewise
i
rose
at
once
to
go
and
see
to
it
do
not
give
yourself
the
trouble
he
exclaimed
distressed
the
servant
went
along
with
me
and
when
we
got
to
the
meydân
rashîd
came
running
sheytân
was
then
indeed
a
terrifying
sight
with
streaming
tail
mane
bristling
and
a
wicked
bloodshot
eye
tearing
at
his
one
minute
pawing
at
the
wall
as
if
to
climb
it
the
next
kicking
wildly
with
his
head
down
i
know
little
of
horses
in
general
but
i
knew
that
particular
horse
and
he
knew
me
i
went
up
quietly
and
talked
to
him
then
loosed
the
rope
and
led
sheytân
away
without
much
difficulty
rashîd
meanwhile
explaining
to
the
servant
of
the
house
that
no
one
else
could
possibly
have
done
it
we
tied
him
at
the
further
end
of
the
meydân
then
i
went
back
on
to
the
terrace
where
the
notables
had
risen
and
were
looking
at
the
youths
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
fantasia
among
them
my
companion
of
the
road
the
young
sheykh
abdul
hamid
these
were
now
on
the
with
their
horses
my
neighbour
in
the
group
of
great
ones
said
politely
honour
should
go
with
them
it
is
only
proper
since
their
going
is
to
compliment
the
representative
of
england
and
you
are
i
see
a
very
skilful
cavalier
the
way
you
quieted
that
horse
of
yours
was
wonderful
we
have
all
been
talking
of
it
ride
with
them
i
begged
to
be
excused
the
essence
of
the
fantasia
is
to
show
off
one
own
prowess
and
one
horse
paces
while
careering
madly
in
a
widish
circle
round
some
given
object
an
open
carriage
with
some
great
one
in
it
or
a
bridal
pair
taking
no
note
of
obstacles
dashing
over
rocks
and
gulleys
and
down
breakneck
slopes
loading
and
firing
off
a
gun
at
intervals
in
full
career
i
had
tried
the
feeling
of
it
once
at
a
friend
wedding
and
had
been
far
from
happy
though
my
horse
enjoyed
the
romp
and
often
tried
to
start
it
afterwards
when
there
was
no
occasion
remembering
abdul
hamid
and
his
desire
for
praise
that
day
i
said
is
only
one
good
horseman
here
abdul
hamid
the
son
of
the
sheykh
mustafa
all
the
rest
of
us
compared
with
him
are
mere
pedestrians
i
pointed
out
the
youth
in
question
to
my
neighbour
who
was
a
man
of
power
in
the
mountains
and
he
praised
the
beauty
of
his
form
on
horseback
allah
right
is
with
thee
he
assented
is
none
but
he
away
they
went
jinblâts
talhûks
and
abdul
meliks
all
in
clean
white
turbans
with
coloured
cloaks
upon
the
breeze
on
horses
gorgeously
caparisoned
we
waited
half
an
hour
in
silence
as
it
seemed
and
then
we
heard
the
noise
of
their
return
the
shouts
the
firing
i
swear
i
saw
a
horse
and
man
surmount
a
housetop
in
the
village
and
then
leap
down
upon
the
other
side
at
last
with
yells
and
reckless
gunshots
and
a
whirl
of
dust
the
crowd
of
horsemen
came
full
tilt
on
the
meydân
their
leader
in
appearance
a
mad
angel
was
my
friend
abdul
hamid
suddenly
he
drew
his
rein
flinging
the
steed
right
back
upon
his
haunches
in
so
doing
looking
up
at
me
with
a
triumphant
smile
he
somehow
missed
his
balance
and
pitched
clear
over
his
horse
head
just
at
the
very
moment
when
a
carriage
and
pair
containing
the
beaming
and
his
lady
with
a
glorious
cawwâs
upon
the
box
arrived
upon
the
scene
i
ran
to
help
him
but
another
person
was
before
me
a
tall
old
man
whose
garb
bespoke
him
an
initiated
druze
rushed
out
among
the
horses
and
the
dust
and
beat
the
wretched
lad
about
the
shoulders
heaping
curses
on
that
lovely
head
for
bringing
shame
upon
an
honoured
house
before
such
company
it
was
the
lad
own
father
the
sheykh
mustafa
i
helped
to
drag
the
old
man
off
and
would
have
gone
on
to
console
the
son
but
just
then
i
beheld
sheytân
approaching
with
a
broken
i
contrived
to
catch
him
and
to
mount
without
attending
to
the
girths
and
once
on
horseback
i
was
glad
to
be
there
for
quite
fifty
of
the
tethered
steeds
had
broken
loose
in
the
excitement
and
were
rushing
here
and
there
and
fighting
in
a
most
alarming
way
i
have
always
had
a
dread
of
and
this
was
not
a
single
fight
it
was
a
mêlée
fresh
horses
every
minute
breaking
loose
to
join
it
right
in
my
way
two
angry
stallions
rose
up
boxing
one
another
like
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
and
a
little
boy
of
ten
or
thereabouts
ran
in
between
and
jumping
caught
their
i
escaped
at
last
and
rode
down
through
the
village
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
where
a
grove
of
walnut
trees
cast
pleasant
shade
beside
a
stream
there
rashîd
found
me
later
in
the
day
he
told
me
that
my
disappearance
had
caused
consternation
and
alarm
the
and
his
lady
having
asked
for
me
bidding
him
remain
with
the
two
horses
i
went
back
on
foot
to
the
castle
where
i
stayed
only
the
time
necessary
to
pay
my
respects
as
i
was
returning
towards
the
valley
a
litter
borne
between
two
mules
was
leaving
the
meydân
beside
it
walked
the
stern
sheykh
mustafa
and
in
it
i
had
little
doubt
reclined
the
beautiful
abdul
hamid
i
asked
the
who
led
the
foremost
mule
if
his
young
lord
was
seriously
hurt
he
answered
for
he
has
broken
his
elbow
and
his
shoulder
and
his
but
that
is
nothing
since
he
has
disgraced
our
house
a
bitter
wail
of
the
day
came
from
within
the
palanquin
chapter
xvii
tragedy
the
sun
was
sinking
down
over
the
sea
the
mountain
wall
with
all
its
clefts
and
promontories
wore
a
cloak
of
many
colours
when
we
saw
before
us
on
a
rock
a
ruined
tower
we
were
looking
for
some
human
habitation
where
we
might
get
food
and
shelter
for
the
night
but
we
should
have
passed
by
that
building
taking
it
to
be
deserted
had
not
we
espied
a
woman
figure
sitting
out
before
it
in
the
evening
light
experience
of
late
had
taught
us
to
shun
villages
belonging
thereabouts
to
a
peculiar
sect
whose
members
made
a
virtue
of
inhospitality
at
noon
that
day
when
wishing
to
buy
food
we
had
been
met
with
such
amazing
insults
that
rashîd
my
henchman
had
not
yet
recovered
from
his
indignation
and
still
brooded
on
revenge
on
seeing
that
the
ruined
tower
had
occupants
he
said
these
refuse
us
we
will
force
an
entrance
mercilessly
for
see
they
dwell
alone
with
none
to
help
them
he
rode
before
me
towards
the
tower
with
shoulders
squared
and
whip
upraised
it
surprised
me
that
the
woman
sitting
out
before
the
door
appeared
indifferent
to
his
approach
until
upon
a
closer
view
i
saw
that
she
was
old
and
blind
she
must
i
thought
be
deaf
as
well
since
she
had
failed
to
move
at
sound
of
hoof
beats
which
sound
brought
out
an
aged
man
who
shattered
rashîd
plan
of
vengeance
by
exclaiming
perform
a
kindness
that
is
is
thou
who
doest
kindness
i
replied
by
rote
are
thy
suppliants
for
food
and
rest
this
night
mine
is
thine
the
old
man
answered
coming
to
hold
my
head
while
i
dismounted
his
wrinkled
face
was
moulded
to
a
patient
sad
expression
which
became
more
noticeable
when
he
smiled
and
he
was
always
smiling
i
went
into
the
tower
and
down
a
flight
of
steps
which
ended
in
a
heap
of
fallen
masonry
to
proceed
called
out
the
tenant
from
behind
me
when
climbing
over
the
obstruction
i
found
myself
in
a
large
room
of
which
the
only
furniture
consisted
in
a
heap
of
bedding
and
some
cooking
things
rather
to
my
surprise
the
place
was
clean
the
old
man
flung
himself
upon
the
ground
and
blew
upon
the
mass
of
charcoal
in
a
brazier
and
presently
a
smell
of
coffee
stewing
filled
the
dungeon
for
such
it
doubtless
had
been
in
the
past
its
only
window
being
high
above
our
heads
yet
only
just
above
the
level
of
the
rock
as
i
discovered
when
i
went
to
seek
rashîd
who
by
our
host
direction
had
bestowed
the
horses
in
a
cavern
by
the
sea
the
blind
old
woman
still
sat
out
before
the
door
i
walked
all
round
the
tower
and
noticed
small
fields
neatly
fenced
below
it
on
the
landward
side
and
a
few
hobbled
goats
upon
a
strip
of
herbage
near
the
shore
which
with
some
spread
out
upon
the
rocks
to
dry
informed
me
how
our
host
obtained
a
livelihood
as
i
went
back
towards
the
door
i
met
rashîd
bringing
our
saddlebags
he
nodded
to
the
woman
who
still
sat
there
motionless
and
told
me
is
mad
the
poor
old
creature
but
not
dangerous
fear
nothing
they
are
quite
good
people
it
is
strange
but
he
informs
me
she
is
not
his
mother
nor
his
wife
nor
anyone
by
birth
allied
to
him
and
yet
he
waits
upon
her
helpless
as
she
is
just
then
the
master
of
the
tower
appeared
and
going
to
the
woman
took
her
hand
and
raised
her
he
said
with
just
the
same
polite
alacrity
with
which
he
welcomed
us
on
our
arrival
as
if
she
too
had
been
an
honoured
guest
we
all
went
down
the
broken
steps
into
the
dungeon
a
meal
of
fish
and
bread
was
set
before
us
the
woman
took
her
food
apart
the
master
of
the
house
did
not
sit
down
till
she
was
satisfied
and
after
supper
he
set
out
a
bed
for
her
and
then
washed
out
the
vessels
before
he
came
again
and
sat
with
us
by
that
time
the
old
woman
was
asleep
two
lighted
wicks
passed
through
a
piece
of
cork
which
floated
in
a
bowl
of
oil
and
water
roused
the
shadows
of
the
vault
a
sudden
outcry
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
made
us
both
jump
nothing
said
our
entertainer
is
dreaming
ah
poor
lady
our
lord
repay
her
goodness
in
the
next
life
for
all
the
evil
she
has
borne
in
this
it
permissible
to
ask
to
hear
her
story
said
rashîd
the
old
man
looked
at
me
with
a
reluctant
smile
as
who
should
say
is
a
sad
tale
would
you
really
care
to
hear
it
i
nodded
gravely
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
began
years
ago
how
many
it
is
now
impossible
for
me
to
say
for
dwelling
here
i
have
lost
count
of
time
a
certain
chieftain
of
the
desert
arabs
had
a
son
who
loved
the
daughter
of
his
father
enemy
there
was
no
intercourse
between
the
houses
but
the
young
prince
of
whom
i
speak
contrived
to
see
the
maiden
and
to
meet
her
stealthily
even
riding
in
among
the
dwellings
of
her
people
at
risk
of
his
own
life
and
mine
for
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
his
though
not
by
blood
a
scion
of
the
desert
and
so
i
served
him
as
was
usual
with
us
in
the
quality
of
an
esquire
tribes
were
of
those
arabs
which
have
villages
for
their
headquarters
without
renouncing
the
old
life
of
war
and
wandering
our
village
was
upon
the
borders
of
the
belka
and
hers
far
north
towards
the
hauran
in
those
days
there
were
no
turkish
military
posts
beyond
the
jordan
the
feuds
and
customs
of
the
tribes
were
then
the
only
law
though
now
they
tell
me
that
that
country
is
made
safe
for
travel
was
no
means
to
bridge
the
gulf
which
custom
fixed
between
the
lovers
and
so
my
being
mad
with
longing
for
the
maid
decided
to
abduct
her
and
escape
into
the
settled
country
i
loving
him
applauded
all
his
schemes
the
princess
amîneh
for
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
sovereign
chief
was
of
a
spirit
equal
to
his
own
she
rode
out
from
her
father
town
by
night
upon
the
best
mare
of
the
tribe
with
but
one
girl
attendant
my
lord
and
i
were
waiting
by
a
certain
well
and
then
we
rode
well
knowing
that
both
tribes
would
hunt
us
towards
the
wilâyet
where
there
was
law
and
turkish
power
to
protect
us
the
princess
amîneh
lacked
a
man
endurance
and
her
woman
suffered
greatly
from
fatigue
their
weakness
had
to
be
considered
and
there
came
a
time
when
it
was
evident
that
they
could
go
no
further
without
rest
were
then
within
a
short
day
journey
of
the
nearest
government
post
attaining
which
we
should
have
been
in
safety
we
took
refuge
in
a
ruined
sheepcote
i
was
keeping
the
while
all
the
others
slept
when
i
noticed
a
small
cloud
of
dust
uprising
in
the
distance
i
roused
my
lord
and
told
him
the
pursuers
come
he
looked
upon
the
princess
and
her
maiden
they
lay
fast
asleep
exhausted
by
fatigue
let
be
he
said
there
is
no
hope
for
us
in
flight
lie
low
perhaps
they
will
pass
by
without
perceiving
us
so
they
might
have
done
god
knows
had
not
our
horses
neighed
winding
the
other
horses
the
old
man
wrung
his
hands
then
hid
his
eyes
with
them
never
can
i
tell
the
details
of
what
followed
we
fought
and
the
princess
fought
beside
us
snatching
a
scimitar
which
i
was
wearing
from
my
side
her
boldness
helped
us
somewhat
to
delay
the
end
for
our
assailants
were
her
father
people
and
they
feared
to
hurt
her
but
the
end
came
it
was
from
the
first
inevitable
i
was
lying
helpless
on
the
ground
wounded
but
fully
conscious
when
they
slew
my
lord
at
once
they
hewed
his
body
into
fragments
each
of
which
was
soon
exalted
on
a
spear
the
princess
wounded
in
the
face
and
pinioned
witnessed
that
her
damsel
lay
inanimate
and
at
the
time
i
thought
her
dead
she
was
my
promised
bride
then
the
emir
approached
with
a
great
spear
as
i
suppose
to
kill
his
daughter
but
just
then
there
were
loud
shouts
and
then
another
battle
in
which
i
heard
the
of
our
tribe
the
father
of
my
lord
pursuing
also
with
intent
to
punish
us
had
come
upon
his
ancient
enemy
at
unawares
he
won
the
day
the
other
arabs
broke
and
fled
the
noblest
of
our
braves
pursued
them
but
several
of
the
lewder
sort
remained
behind
to
torture
and
dishonour
my
unhappy
lady
i
tried
to
rise
and
rescue
her
but
with
the
effort
my
spirit
left
my
body
and
i
lay
as
dead
the
praise
to
allah
which
is
the
reason
why
i
am
alive
great
a
fight
could
not
take
place
so
near
the
guarded
country
without
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
government
ten
turkish
soldiers
armed
with
carbines
and
an
ombashi
coming
to
the
spot
next
day
discovered
us
and
carried
the
survivors
to
a
place
of
safety
the
princess
was
then
as
you
yourselves
have
seen
her
except
that
she
was
young
and
now
is
old
her
damsel
had
survived
the
fight
without
much
hurt
by
god
protection
having
lain
upon
the
ground
so
still
that
she
was
left
for
dead
when
i
recovered
from
my
wounds
i
married
her
tragic
was
our
tale
that
all
men
pitied
us
the
governor
himself
protected
the
princess
and
placed
her
with
the
women
of
his
household
but
she
could
not
be
happy
in
the
city
in
that
kind
of
life
her
soul
grew
restless
pining
my
wife
who
visited
her
every
day
was
grieved
for
her
and
when
i
found
that
it
was
as
she
said
i
went
and
asked
the
governor
permission
to
support
our
lady
perceiving
that
she
was
not
happy
in
his
house
he
yielded
and
we
three
wandered
through
the
settled
country
for
long
months
the
people
showing
kindness
to
us
through
compassion
for
our
tale
was
known
at
last
we
reached
this
ruin
by
the
sea
which
pleased
our
lady
because
my
wife
believed
the
mountains
are
so
like
a
wall
raised
up
between
her
and
the
country
of
her
grief
that
must
be
thirty
years
ago
but
she
has
never
wandered
since
wife
died
and
i
buried
her
beside
the
shore
for
years
i
have
performed
her
duties
to
our
lady
the
people
of
these
parts
are
wicked
but
they
let
us
be
because
they
think
that
we
are
under
some
enchantment
my
prayer
is
always
that
i
may
survive
my
lady
for
how
could
she
poor
creature
fare
alone
so
far
we
have
been
very
fortunate
praise
be
to
allah
rashîd
was
loud
in
his
expressions
of
amazement
at
the
story
his
mind
intent
upon
the
central
tragedy
he
said
no
word
of
praise
or
wonder
at
our
host
that
he
accepted
as
a
thing
of
course
this
attitude
of
his
which
i
observed
prevented
me
from
uttering
the
words
of
pity
and
condolence
which
were
on
my
tongue
and
i
am
glad
those
words
were
never
uttered
for
they
were
impertinent
and
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
orientals
who
have
not
our
sentiment
so
after
the
conclusion
of
the
tale
we
went
to
bed
chapter
xviii
bastirma
the
moon
began
to
shine
upon
the
gardens
of
damascus
casting
pale
shadows
though
the
daylight
had
not
quite
departed
and
the
sky
behind
the
trees
to
westward
was
still
green
we
were
sitting
out
on
stools
under
the
walnut
trees
beside
a
stream
which
made
a
pleasant
murmur
the
air
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
unseen
roses
behind
us
was
a
little
tavern
with
a
lantern
lighted
in
its
entrance
arch
a
solitary
yellow
eye
amid
the
twilight
we
were
the
centre
of
a
crowd
as
usual
when
suleymân
was
with
us
his
voice
attracted
people
like
a
drum
and
the
matter
of
his
talk
had
power
to
hold
them
it
was
a
weighty
voice
of
studied
modulations
which
promised
wisdom
on
the
brink
of
laughter
he
generally
chose
some
moral
or
religious
subject
for
discourse
and
illustrated
it
by
what
we
call
rare
things
selected
from
his
vast
experience
of
life
by
his
own
account
he
had
journeyed
to
the
rim
and
had
associated
not
alone
with
men
but
also
with
jinn
and
ghouls
on
the
other
hand
he
had
been
to
europe
several
times
and
knew
the
streets
of
paris
and
of
london
somehow
one
never
doubted
any
of
his
stories
while
he
was
telling
them
the
accents
of
his
voice
had
such
conviction
one
was
conscious
that
his
tales
even
the
most
extravagant
were
true
in
some
mysterious
intrinsic
way
this
time
he
chose
to
speak
to
us
of
guilt
and
innocence
of
good
and
evil
works
and
their
effect
on
man
salvation
he
aired
the
theory
which
roused
approving
murmurs
in
the
listening
circle
that
to
have
a
good
intention
was
the
chief
desideratum
for
every
son
of
adam
on
his
journey
through
the
world
no
matter
though
his
works
might
turn
out
bad
or
unsuccessful
lie
with
good
intention
is
better
than
to
tell
the
truth
with
bad
intention
he
declared
lie
is
the
salt
of
a
man
the
shame
is
to
him
who
believes
put
in
rashîd
my
servant
who
was
great
at
proverbs
suleymân
paid
no
heed
to
the
interruption
sin
committed
thoughtlessly
said
he
light
compared
with
one
which
thou
hast
hatched
and
planned
o
beloved
a
sin
is
a
sin
appointed
so
by
the
most
high
and
the
duty
of
a
man
is
to
avoid
it
the
hurt
to
man
salvation
is
the
same
however
he
approach
it
said
an
old
man
in
the
audience
i
cut
my
hand
is
the
wound
less
is
it
not
rather
likely
to
be
more
for
being
thoughtless
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
as
all
eyes
turned
on
this
objector
whose
likeness
could
not
be
distinguished
in
the
gloaming
i
spoke
in
approbation
of
the
view
expressed
and
the
old
man
emboldened
laughed
lie
is
bad
to
kill
is
bad
to
steal
is
bad
our
lord
destroy
this
rogue
of
an
intention
which
plain
men
can
not
catch
nor
understand
listen
suleymân
became
persuasive
and
profoundly
earnest
as
was
his
manner
always
under
opposition
hast
not
altogether
caught
my
meaning
i
say
a
man
should
trust
in
the
most
high
not
think
too
much
beforehand
of
his
ways
by
thinking
beforehand
he
may
form
a
bad
intention
since
man
thoughts
are
naturally
fallible
let
him
think
afterwards
thus
he
will
learn
to
shun
such
snares
in
future
and
by
repentance
place
a
good
work
to
his
credit
men
learn
wisdom
from
their
sins
not
from
their
righteous
deeds
and
the
consciousness
of
sin
the
knowledge
that
they
may
at
any
moment
fall
into
it
preserves
them
from
the
arrogance
of
goodness
may
be
some
small
grain
of
sense
in
what
thou
sayest
chuckled
the
objector
not
enough
to
make
sin
righteous
nor
yet
to
abrogate
the
sacred
law
suleymân
pursued
unheeding
have
a
rare
thing
which
will
show
you
what
i
mean
new
judge
had
been
appointed
to
the
holy
city
he
was
departing
from
stambûl
by
ship
to
take
up
his
appointment
on
the
quay
a
jew
of
his
acquaintance
came
to
him
with
reverence
and
begged
him
kindly
to
convey
a
basket
of
bastirma
to
his
the
jew
son
at
the
holy
city
which
the
jews
in
their
own
language
call
jerusalem
you
all
know
what
bastirma
is
it
is
dried
and
salted
mutton
very
tasty
a
dish
of
which
the
turks
are
most
inordinately
fond
the
cadi
graciously
consented
bidding
his
take
the
basket
and
bestow
it
carefully
among
the
things
the
jew
departed
the
cadi
and
his
party
journeyed
till
they
reached
their
destination
where
upon
arrival
they
discovered
a
young
jew
inquiring
earnestly
about
a
basket
of
bastirma
the
cadi
had
forgotten
its
existence
ah
to
be
sure
he
cried
i
gave
it
my
for
safe
keeping
called
that
servant
and
commanded
him
to
give
the
basket
of
bastirma
to
the
jew
there
waiting
the
bowed
his
head
folded
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
said
i
ask
forgiveness
o
my
lord
the
basket
still
remains
but
the
bastirma
was
so
excellent
that
having
tasted
but
a
piece
of
it
i
wanted
more
so
that
in
fact
i
ate
it
all
upon
the
journey
i
wish
to
pay
the
price
of
it
to
this
young
jew
cadi
thought
his
servant
offer
fair
enough
but
the
young
jew
went
mad
flying
at
the
throat
of
the
he
flung
him
to
the
ground
and
tried
to
tear
the
soul
out
of
his
body
with
his
teeth
and
nails
the
cadi
called
upon
the
bystanders
for
help
the
jew
was
dragged
with
difficulty
from
his
victim
then
the
cadi
asked
why
pray
did
you
attack
my
servant
in
that
savage
way
that
man
said
the
jew
still
white
with
rage
and
pointing
with
his
tallow
finger
at
the
who
had
risen
from
the
ground
that
man
contains
my
grandfather
what
words
are
these
explain
yourself
the
cadi
cried
three
weeks
ago
o
gracious
excellency
my
grandfather
died
in
stambûl
it
had
ever
been
his
dearest
wish
to
be
buried
in
the
holy
city
near
the
scene
of
judgment
and
that
wish
of
his
was
law
on
us
his
offspring
but
how
could
we
fulfil
it
how
i
ask
no
skipper
whether
nazarene
or
muslim
would
receive
a
dead
jew
on
his
ship
for
less
than
the
in
gold
and
we
are
poor
to
take
him
overland
was
quite
impossible
and
so
my
father
and
my
mother
in
stambûl
cured
his
dead
limbs
and
made
of
them
bastirma
and
sent
him
hither
in
the
way
thou
knowest
it
follows
that
thy
servant
has
committed
a
most
dreadful
crime
let
him
be
killed
i
pray
and
buried
in
the
tomb
we
have
prepared
that
so
my
grandfather
great
wish
may
be
fulfilled
was
more
dead
than
living
as
he
heard
that
story
he
rent
his
clothes
and
fell
down
on
the
ground
insensible
cadi
answered
the
young
jew
with
wisdom
saying
thou
art
entitled
to
the
price
of
one
basket
of
bastirma
and
no
more
from
this
my
servant
but
he
on
his
side
has
a
right
to
all
thou
ownest
what
wealth
can
ever
compensate
him
for
the
haunting
fear
that
on
the
last
day
he
may
rise
inextricably
mingled
with
thy
worthy
grandfather
go
i
say
and
never
venture
to
approach
him
any
more
or
i
shall
surely
act
upon
this
judgment
and
denude
thee
quite
the
cries
of
miskîn
poor
fellow
interrupted
the
narrative
one
said
once
ate
pig
flesh
by
mistake
but
this
man
plight
is
much
more
horrible
suleymân
opponent
cried
was
a
judgment
on
him
evidently
for
his
theft
of
the
bastirma
say
what
became
of
him
thereafter
o
narrator
who
till
then
had
been
a
precious
rogue
i
knew
him
intimately
from
a
child
and
so
can
vouch
for
it
became
from
that
day
forth
the
saintliest
of
men
he
thought
about
his
crime
and
mourned
for
it
and
deemed
himself
an
unclean
beast
until
he
died
may
god
have
mercy
on
him
and
was
buried
in
the
holy
city
as
the
jew
desired
he
thought
of
nothing
but
good
deeds
yet
without
seeking
merit
knowing
that
nothing
he
could
do
would
ever
cleanse
him
he
became
the
humblest
and
the
best
of
men
who
had
before
been
arrogant
and
very
wicked
therefore
i
say
that
it
is
well
for
men
to
think
of
their
sins
after
rather
than
before
committing
them
the
intention
what
of
the
intention
o
my
master
his
intention
was
not
good
he
stole
intention
went
no
further
than
a
basket
of
bastirma
the
jew
was
only
an
unpleasant
accident
in
respect
whereof
no
guilt
attached
to
him
the
case
is
clear
and
yet
although
i
used
to
argue
with
him
on
the
subject
i
never
could
contrive
to
make
him
see
it
one
thing
is
certain
and
will
prove
to
you
the
worth
of
good
intentions
he
only
meant
to
eat
a
basket
of
bastirma
therefore
he
felt
great
remorse
when
he
devoured
a
jew
and
so
became
a
saint
for
paradise
had
he
intended
to
devour
a
jew
he
could
not
possibly
have
felt
such
great
remorse
what
say
you
and
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
so
chapter
xix
the
of
suleymân
in
his
capacity
of
dragoman
i
saw
little
but
heard
much
both
from
himself
and
others
the
english
residents
in
palestine
and
syria
those
who
knew
of
him
regarded
him
as
but
a
doubtful
character
if
one
may
judge
from
their
repeated
warnings
to
me
not
to
trust
him
out
of
sight
his
wisdom
and
his
independent
way
of
airing
it
did
not
please
everybody
as
they
did
me
and
reverence
in
dealing
with
a
was
not
his
strong
point
by
travellers
i
gather
from
innumerable
testimonials
which
he
showed
me
he
was
either
much
beloved
or
the
reverse
though
none
could
say
he
did
not
know
his
business
his
english
though
voluminous
and
comprehensive
was
sometimes
strange
to
native
english
ears
he
had
read
the
bible
in
a
german
mission
school
and
spoke
of
donkey
and
mighty
simson
where
we
should
speak
of
balaam
ass
and
samson
he
called
the
goatskins
used
for
carrying
water
skins
and
sometimes
strengthened
a
mild
sentence
with
an
expletive
i
do
not
think
he
ever
went
so
far
in
this
way
as
another
dragoman
who
riding
out
from
haifa
one
fine
morning
with
an
english
lady
pointed
to
mount
carmel
and
observed
fine
hill
madam
he
knew
how
to
adapt
his
language
to
his
audience
but
it
is
curious
that
a
man
whose
speech
in
arabic
was
highly
mannered
in
english
should
have
cultivated
solecisms
that
he
did
cultivate
them
as
an
asset
of
his
i
can
affirm
for
he
would
invent
absurd
mistakes
and
then
rehearse
them
to
me
with
the
question
that
funny
will
that
make
the
english
laugh
for
clergymen
he
kept
a
special
manner
and
a
special
store
of
jokes
when
leading
such
through
palestine
he
always
had
a
bible
up
before
him
on
the
saddle
and
every
night
would
join
them
after
dinner
and
preach
a
sermon
on
the
subject
of
the
next
day
journey
this
he
would
make
as
comical
as
possible
for
their
amusement
for
clergymen
he
often
used
to
say
to
me
are
fond
of
laughter
of
a
certain
kind
one
english
parson
he
bedevilled
utterly
by
telling
him
the
truth
or
the
accepted
legend
in
such
a
form
that
it
seemed
false
or
mad
to
him
as
they
were
riding
out
from
jaffa
towards
jerusalem
he
pointed
to
the
village
of
latrûn
and
said
sir
is
the
place
where
simpson
catch
the
foxes
said
the
clergyman
who
was
simpson
was
a
very
clever
gentleman
and
liked
a
bit
of
sport
he
an
englishman
sir
he
was
a
jew
he
catch
a
lot
of
foxes
with
some
traps
he
kill
them
and
he
take
their
skins
to
jaffa
to
the
tailor
and
he
tell
the
tailor
make
me
one
big
skin
out
of
these
little
ones
the
tailor
make
one
thundering
big
fox
skin
big
enough
for
simpson
to
get
inside
of
it
then
simpson
he
put
on
that
skin
one
night
and
go
and
sit
out
in
the
field
and
make
the
same
noise
what
the
little
foxes
make
the
little
foxes
come
out
of
their
holes
to
look
they
see
one
big
fox
sitting
there
and
they
not
know
it
really
simpson
they
come
quite
near
and
simpson
catch
hold
of
their
tails
and
tie
their
tails
together
then
they
make
the
noise
and
still
more
foxes
come
and
simpson
catch
hold
of
their
tails
and
tie
their
tails
together
till
he
got
hundreds
and
hundreds
did
he
do
with
them
inquired
the
parson
set
fire
to
them
on
earth
did
he
do
that
for
sir
was
to
annoy
his
wife
relations
would
you
believe
it
added
suleymân
when
he
told
me
the
story
foolish
preacher
did
not
know
that
it
is
in
the
bible
he
took
it
all
down
in
his
notebook
as
the
exploit
of
a
jewish
traveller
he
was
the
heavy
one
the
last
remark
was
in
allusion
to
an
arabic
proverb
of
which
suleymân
was
very
fond
the
heavy
one
alights
in
the
territory
of
a
people
there
is
nothing
for
the
inhabitants
except
departure
which
in
its
turn
is
an
allusion
to
the
following
story
a
colony
of
ducks
lived
on
an
island
in
a
river
happily
until
a
certain
day
when
the
carcase
of
an
ox
came
drifting
down
the
current
and
stuck
upon
the
forepoint
of
that
island
they
tried
in
vain
to
lift
it
up
or
push
it
off
it
was
too
heavy
to
be
moved
an
inch
by
all
their
efforts
they
named
it
in
their
speech
the
heavy
one
its
stench
infected
the
whole
island
and
kept
on
increasing
until
the
hapless
ducks
were
forced
to
emigrate
many
heavy
ones
fell
to
the
lot
of
suleymân
as
dragoman
and
he
was
by
temperament
to
endure
their
neighbourhood
upon
the
other
hand
he
sometimes
happened
on
eccentrics
who
rejoiced
his
heart
an
american
admiral
on
shore
in
palestine
for
two
days
asked
only
one
thing
to
be
shown
the
tree
on
which
judas
iscariot
had
hanged
himself
in
order
that
he
might
defile
it
in
a
natural
manner
and
so
attest
his
faith
suleymân
was
able
to
conduct
him
to
the
very
tree
and
to
make
the
journey
occupy
exactly
the
time
specified
the
american
was
satisfied
and
wrote
him
out
a
handsome
testimonial
it
must
have
been
a
hardship
for
suleymân
a
man
by
nature
sensitive
and
independent
to
take
his
orders
from
some
kinds
of
tourists
and
endure
their
rudeness
if
left
alone
to
manage
the
whole
journey
he
was
i
have
been
told
and
i
can
well
believe
it
the
best
guide
in
syria
devoting
all
his
energies
to
make
the
tour
illuminating
and
enjoyable
if
heckled
or
distrusted
he
grew
careless
and
eventually
dangerous
intent
to
play
off
jokes
on
people
whom
he
counted
enemies
one
englishman
with
a
taste
for
management
but
little
knowledge
of
the
country
and
no
common
sense
he
cruelly
obeyed
in
all
things
with
the
natural
result
in
loss
of
time
and
loss
of
luggage
sickness
and
discomfort
that
was
his
way
of
taking
vengeance
on
the
heavy
ones
yet
the
man
was
happy
having
had
things
his
own
way
even
after
the
most
horrid
and
disastrous
journey
ever
made
he
told
me
with
a
sigh
men
are
asses
one
afternoon
when
i
was
riding
round
the
bay
from
akka
towards
the
foot
of
carmel
supposing
suleymân
to
be
a
hundred
miles
away
i
came
upon
a
group
of
tourists
by
the
river
kishon
on
the
outskirts
of
the
palm
grove
they
had
alighted
and
were
grouped
around
a
dragoman
in
gorgeous
raiment
like
gulls
around
a
parrot
the
native
of
the
land
was
holding
forth
to
them
his
voice
was
richly
clerical
in
intonation
which
made
me
notice
that
his
audience
consisted
solely
of
members
of
the
clergy
and
their
patient
women
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
rascal
was
declaiming
like
a
man
inspired
that
ancient
riffer
the
riffer
kishon
it
was
here
that
the
great
brophet
elijah

massycration
gentlemen
the
preacher
was
suleymân
at
struggle
with
the
heavy
ones
he
was
not
at
all
abashed
when
he
caught
sight
of
me
chapter
xx
love
and
the
patriarch
i
was
staying
for
some
weeks
at
howard
hotel
in
jerusalem
iskender
awwad
the
dragoman
had
transformed
himself
into
the
chevalier
alexander
howard
a
worthy
if
choleric
gentleman
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
i
rode
out
every
day
upon
a
decent
pony
which
i
had
discovered
in
the
stables
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
one
afternoon
a
nephew
of
the
who
was
something
of
a
blood
proposed
that
we
should
ride
together
out
towards
bethlehem
his
horse
was
a
superb
and
showy
stallion
quite
beyond
his
power
to
manage
properly
my
modest
steed
was
fired
to
emulation
and
once
beyond
the
outskirts
of
jerusalem
we
tore
away
at
a
corner
where
the
road
was
narrow
between
rocks
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
big
horse
cannoned
into
mine
and
overturned
him
i
pitched
headlong
on
some
stones
my
first
impression
was
that
i
had
struck
a
wet
spot
in
that
arid
wilderness
then
i
saw
my
horse
at
a
great
distance
galloping
and
heard
the
nephew
of
the
owner
saying
that
he
must
pursue
it
while
i
must
mount
his
horse
and
ride
on
slowly
half
a
mile
from
here
upon
that
hill
he
said
katamûn
the
country
seat
of
the
greek
patriarch
there
you
are
certain
to
find
people
who
will
have
compassion
would
god
that
i
had
never
lived
to
see
this
day
would
god
that
i
were
in
the
grave
instead
of
you
he
seemed
beside
himself
with
grief
and
fear
on
my
account
and
yet
the
sense
of
property
remained
supreme
his
first
concern
was
to
retrieve
the
runaway
bewildered
and
unable
to
see
clearly
i
did
not
mount
the
horse
which
would
have
mastered
me
in
that
condition
but
led
him
slowly
up
the
hill
to
katamûn
upon
the
top
there
was
a
grove
of
trees
above
which
peeped
some
flat
roofs
and
a
dome
at
length
i
reached
the
gate
of
this
enclosure
it
was
open
and
i
led
the
horse
along
a
sort
of
drive
on
which
were
many
chickens
and
a
tethered
sheep
which
bolting
round
a
tree
at
our
approach
became
inextricably
tangled
in
its
rope
in
a
court
between
a
little
church
and
other
buildings
a
grim
old
woman
in
a
coloured
looked
at
me
out
of
a
doorway
i
called
to
her
that
i
had
had
an
accident
and
asked
the
favour
of
some
and
a
bandage
she
stared
at
me
in
doleful
wise
and
shook
her
head
bring
me
water
i
insisted
she
went
indoors
and
fetched
a
man
of
the
same
breed
whose
eyes
grew
large
and
dull
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
me
again
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
wash
my
head
and
face
i
heard
the
woman
whisper
i
bring
it
and
the
man
reply
be
this
form
is
half
a
corpse
already
he
will
surely
die
the
horse
perhaps
is
stolen
there
has
been
a
fight
if
we
should
touch
him
we
might
be
concerned
in
it
wait
till
the
end
then
we
will
summon
his
beatitude
and
have
our
testimony
written
down
to
prove
our
innocence
amazed
at
their
stupidity
i
took
a
step
towards
them
arguing
they
vanished
headlong
when
i
realised
for
the
first
time
that
my
appearance
was
in
truth
alarming
perceiving
the
advantage
that
appearance
gave
me
i
pursued
them
promising
them
plagues
in
this
world
and
perdition
in
the
next
unless
they
brought
some
water
instantly
the
horse
which
i
was
leading
all
this
while
had
been
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
but
frightened
by
my
shouts
and
gestures
he
became
unmanageable
i
was
struggling
with
him
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
when
a
large
and
dignified
ecclesiastic
came
upon
the
scene
the
jewelled
cross
upon
his
cassock
flashing
in
the
sun
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
subdued
the
horse
and
tied
him
to
a
ring
in
the
wall
which
i
in
my
bewilderment
had
failed
to
see
had
seized
me
by
the
collar
of
my
coat
and
driven
me
before
him
through
a
kind
of
tunnel
to
a
second
court
in
which
there
was
a
cistern
and
a
pump
he
worked
that
pump
and
held
my
head
beneath
it
cursing
the
servants
for
a
pack
of
imbeciles
the
man
and
woman
reappeared
completely
tamed
he
sent
them
running
one
for
stuff
to
make
a
bandage
the
other
for
medicaments
but
said
no
word
to
me
until
the
work
was
ended
when
he
grinned
and
asked
happy
now
i
told
him
that
i
felt
a
great
deal
better
he
said
and
led
me
by
the
hand
into
an
upper
chamber
richly
carpeted
and
furnished
with
a
cushioned
divan
of
which
the
windows
framed
a
wide
view
eastward
over
the
judæan
wilderness
there
sitting
comfortably
he
asked
who
i
was
and
of
what
country
and
hearing
that
i
came
from
england
questioned
me
about
the
high
church
and
the
low
church
in
that
land
and
whether
they
formed
one
communion
or
were
separate
a
problem
which
he
seemed
to
think
of
great
importance
he
was
glad
he
said
that
i
was
not
a
roman
catholic
a
sect
which
he
regarded
as
the
worst
of
heretics
but
his
concern
with
all
these
matters
seemed
perfunctory
compared
with
the
delight
he
took
in
farming
for
when
i
noticed
from
the
window
some
sleek
cows
munching
in
a
small
enclosure
he
brightened
up
and
told
me
they
were
recent
purchases
he
talked
about
his
poultry
and
his
sheep
and
goats
all
of
which
he
would
be
pleased
to
show
me
if
i
cared
to
see
them
accordingly
when
we
had
drunk
some
coffee
which
completed
my
revival
he
took
me
out
and
showed
me
round
his
small
demesne
we
were
standing
in
the
shade
of
trees
discussing
turkeys
when
my
companion
of
the
road
arrived
upon
the
truant
horse
he
was
a
member
of
the
orthodox
greek
church
what
was
my
amazement
when
having
tied
up
the
horse
he
came
with
reverent
haste
and
knelt
at
my
companion
feet
kissing
his
hand
with
pious
and
devoted
fervour
the
priest
with
full
brown
eyes
and
hair
that
curled
below
the
tall
black
like
a
trimming
of
grey
astrakhan
with
whom
i
had
been
talking
so
familiarly
was
no
other
than
the
successor
of
james
the
orthodox
patriarch
of
jerusalem
i
had
supposed
him
some
or
domestic
chaplain
his
beatitude
acknowledged
my
surprise
by
an
ironic
grin
the
new
arrival
still
upon
his
knees
embarked
on
a
long
story
told
in
lamentable
tones
about
a
man
who
was
in
love
and
like
to
die
of
it
with
a
young
girl
who
was
the
sister
of
his
brother
wife
it
is
forbidden
by
the
canons
of
the
eastern
church
for
two
brothers
to
marry
two
sisters
there
no
way
by
which
he
may
obtain
her
lawfully
the
suppliant
asked
the
patriarch
assumed
an
air
of
weariness
and
shook
his
head
he
were
a
catholic
or
a
protestant
he
could
obtain
her
lawfully
the
patriarch
assumed
an
air
of
pitying
scorn
case
is
very
hard
the
suppliant
moaned
as
he
rose
up
from
the
ground
at
last
and
cleaned
his
knees
the
patriarch
with
a
shrug
remarked
that
it
was
so
the
young
man
should
not
have
cast
eyes
upon
a
maid
unlawful
to
him
only
way
he
said
to
obtain
annulment
of
the
marriage
by
proving
it
to
be
illegal
in
some
way
with
that
he
left
the
subject
and
resumed
his
talk
concerning
poultry
my
companion
of
the
road
was
plucking
at
my
sleeve
i
took
leave
of
the
patriarch
respectfully
with
many
thanks
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
saying
again
and
never
seek
to
wed
the
sister
of
thy
brother
wife
your
church
does
not
forbid
such
marriage
does
it
being
still
tainted
with
the
latin
heresy
why
does
the
orthodox
church
forbid
it
because
it
brings
confusion
into
families
and
is
indecent
he
seemed
to
jest
but
the
look
he
gave
to
my
companion
as
we
rode
away
was
stern
i
thought
and
more
than
excepting
that
my
head
was
bandaged
i
felt
well
again
so
we
rode
on
as
we
had
first
intended
towards
bethlehem
over
a
rocky
land
with
patches
of
pink
cyclamen
black
crows
were
wheeling
in
a
sky
of
vivid
blue
we
came
into
the
olive
groves
beneath
the
hill
on
which
stands
the
greek
priory
of
mâr
elias
when
my
companion
said
ingratiatingly
you
please
we
will
call
at
the
monastery
and
take
refreshment
the
monks
are
friends
of
mine
it
was
with
the
object
of
this
visit
that
i
led
our
ride
in
this
direction
as
i
raised
no
objection
we
tied
up
our
horses
in
the
garden
of
the
monastery
and
went
in
we
found
the
prior
in
the
middle
of
a
a
number
of
greek
neighbours
of
both
sexes
being
gathered
in
a
very
room
my
friend
ere
entering
implored
me
in
a
whisper
not
to
tell
them
that
my
accident
was
owing
to
his
clumsy
horsemanship
instead
he
put
about
some
story
which
i
did
not
clearly
overhear
something
about
a
fight
with
desert
arabs
redounding
to
my
credit
i
conclude
from
the
solicitude
which
everyone
expressed
on
my
account
when
he
had
told
it
some
of
the
ladies
present
insisted
on
a
second
washing
of
my
wounds
with
and
a
second
bandaging
with
finer
linen
than
the
patriarch
had
used
some
monks
their
long
hair
frizzed
coquettishly
and
tied
with
ribbon
helped
in
the
work
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
them
my
friend
meanwhile
was
talking
to
some
pretty
girls
when
we
rode
off
again
towards
jerusalem
he
asked
me
questions
about
the
anglican
and
roman
churches
and
seemed
to
think
it
a
sad
defect
in
the
former
that
it
lacked
the
faculty
of
dispensation
with
regard
to
marriage
after
a
space
of
silence
as
we
were
riding
down
the
hill
by
the
ophthalmic
hospital
with
the
tower
of
david
and
the
city
walls
crowning
the
steep
before
us
he
inquired
you
observe
those
girls
with
whom
i
was
conversing
especially
the
one
with
ribbons
it
is
her
i
love
and
when
i
complimented
him
on
his
good
taste
he
added
think
i
shall
become
a
catholic
and
started
weeping
i
then
learnt
from
his
broken
speech
that
he
was
himself
the
hapless
lover
of
his
story
to
the
patriarch
the
girl
whom
i
had
seen
at
mâr
elias
was
the
sister
of
his
brother
wife
i
was
as
sympathetic
in
appearance
as
i
could
be
but
somehow
all
my
sympathy
was
with
the
patriarch
who
seemed
to
me
the
only
man
whom
i
had
seen
that
day
chapter
xxi
the
unpopular
landowner
i
had
decided
to
buy
land
and
settle
down
in
syria
and
had
obtained
consent
from
home
upon
condition
that
i
did
not
spend
more
than
a
certain
sum
of
money
not
a
large
one
which
suleymân
had
told
me
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
the
purpose
he
pointed
out
how
lands
at
present
desert
and
to
be
bought
for
a
mere
song
could
be
rendered
profitable
for
the
cost
of
bringing
water
to
them
there
was
such
a
tract
of
land
adjacent
to
the
village
where
he
had
a
house
with
water
running
under
it
at
no
great
depth
rashîd
my
servant
did
not
like
this
notion
of
converting
deserts
into
gardens
he
called
it
simple
waste
of
time
and
labour
when
gardens
ready
made
were
going
cheap
there
was
a
nice
estate
with
two
perennial
springs
within
its
boundaries
near
his
village
in
the
north
his
people
would
be
proud
and
gratified
if
i
would
honour
their
poor
dwelling
while
inspecting
it
suleymân
lamented
that
his
house
was
quite
unworthy
of
my
occupation
but
proposed
to
have
a
fine
pavilion
pitched
outside
it
if
i
would
deign
to
grace
the
village
as
his
guest
upon
it
said
an
englishman
whom
i
consulted
on
one
of
my
rare
visits
to
the
city
land
they
recommend
belongs
to
their
relations
they
will
sell
it
you
for
twenty
times
the
market
value
and
then
adhere
to
you
like
leeches
till
they
sucked
you
dry
he
added
advise
you
to
give
up
the
whole
idea
but
i
was
used
to
that
advice
and
firm
against
it
his
warning
against
native
counsellors
however
weighed
with
me
to
this
extent
that
i
determined
to
ignore
the
lands
they
recommended
in
their
neighbourhood
each
was
at
first
cast
down
when
i
announced
this
resolution
but
presently
rashîd
exclaimed
matter
where
we
dwell
i
still
shall
serve
thee
and
suleymân
after
smoking
his
narghîleh
a
long
while
in
silence
said
summer
i
will
visit
thee
and
give
advice
all
three
of
us
then
set
to
work
upon
inquiries
innumerable
were
the
sheykhs
who
seemed
to
be
in
money
difficulties
and
wished
to
sell
their
land
some
owners
journeyed
forty
miles
to
come
and
see
me
and
explain
the
great
advantage
of
their
property
but
knowing
something
of
the
land
code
i
inquired
about
the
tenure
i
wanted
only
or
freehold
land
and
land
held
in
tail
or
mortmain
of
various
and
awful
kinds
is
much
more
common
at
last
a
sheykh
came
who
declared
his
land
was
and
certain
of
our
neighbours
men
of
worth
testified
of
their
certain
knowledge
that
he
spoke
the
truth
the
village
where
the
property
was
situated
was
a
long
day
journey
from
our
own
a
fortnight
after
my
discussion
with
the
owner
suleymân
and
i
set
out
on
our
way
thither
having
sent
rashîd
ahead
of
us
to
find
a
decent
lodging
since
it
was
our
intention
to
remain
there
several
days
the
village
was
arranged
in
steps
upon
a
mountain
side
the
roofs
of
houses
on
the
lower
level
serving
as
approach
to
those
above
on
all
the
steep
slopes
round
about
it
there
were
orchards
with
now
and
then
a
house
among
the
trees
rashîd
came
out
to
meet
us
accompanied
by
certain
of
the
elders
among
whom
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
owner
of
the
land
we
were
to
visit
my
first
inquiry
was
for
him
rashîd
replied
is
unpopular
i
went
to
the
chief
people
of
the
village
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
persons
who
escorted
him
they
have
set
apart
a
house
and
stable
for
your
honour
use
the
house
turned
out
to
be
a
single
room
and
furnished
only
with
some
matting
the
stable
part
of
the
same
building
was
exactly
like
it
except
that
it
was
open
at
one
end
we
had
our
supper
at
a
tavern
by
the
village
spring
surrounded
by
a
friendly
crowd
of
fellâhîn
again
i
looked
for
the
old
gentleman
whom
i
had
come
to
see
and
whispered
my
surprise
at
not
beholding
him
rashîd
again
replied
is
unpopular
returning
to
the
house
with
me
rashîd
arranged
my
bed
put
candle
matches
cigarettes
within
my
reach
fastened
the
shutters
of
two
windows
and
retired
informing
me
that
he
and
suleymân
were
sleeping
at
the
dwelling
of
the
headman
of
the
place
i
had
got
into
my
bed
upon
the
floor
when
there
came
a
knocking
on
the
solid
wooden
shutters
which
rashîd
had
closed
i
went
and
opened
one
of
them
a
little
way
it
was
moonlight
but
the
window
looked
into
the
gloom
of
olive
trees
a
voice
out
of
the
shadows
questioned
it
thou
the
englishman
it
was
the
owner
of
the
land
who
then
reproached
me
in
heartbroken
tones
because
i
had
not
let
him
know
the
hour
of
my
arrival
that
he
and
his
three
sons
might
have
gone
forth
upon
the
road
to
meet
me
the
owners
of
the
place
where
now
i
lodged
were
his
chief
enemies
he
begged
me
to
steal
forth
at
once
and
come
with
him
when
i
refused
he
groaned
despairingly
and
left
me
with
the
words
not
anything
they
say
about
us
or
the
property
i
closed
the
shutter
and
went
back
to
bed
but
it
was
hot
i
rose
again
and
opened
both
the
windows
so
as
to
secure
whatever
breeze
there
was
and
after
a
long
spell
of
angry
tossing
due
to
sandflies
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
the
room
was
full
of
daylight
and
a
murmur
which
i
first
mistook
for
that
of
insects
but
soon
found
out
to
be
the
voice
of
a
considerable
crowd
of
human
beings
at
every
window
was
a
press
of
faces
and
of
women
and
children
raised
upon
their
mothers
shoulders
i
heard
a
child
sad
wail
mother
lift
me
up
that
i
too
may
behold
the
unbeliever
i
made
haste
to
cover
myself
somehow
for
in
my
sleep
i
had
kicked
off
the
bedclothes
and
commanded
all
those
women
to
be
gone
immediately
they
merely
grinned
and
wished
me
a
good
day
and
then
discussed
my
personal
appearance
the
whiteness
of
my
skin
and
more
particularly
my
pyjamas
with
much
interest
this
went
on
till
rashîd
appeared
upon
the
scene
bringing
my
bath
and
a
kerosene
tin
full
of
water
he
closed
and
bolted
all
the
shutters
firmly
with
stern
reflections
on
the
lack
of
shame
of
my
admirers
i
told
him
of
the
visit
of
the
owner
of
the
land
he
answered
as
before
is
unpopular
i
asked
the
reason
and
he
told
me
are
in
this
part
of
the
country
two
factions
which
have
existed
from
old
time
all
the
people
in
this
village
are
adherents
of
one
faction
except
that
old
man
and
his
children
who
uphold
the
other
the
people
would
not
mind
so
much
if
he
kept
silent
but
he
gibes
at
them
and
vaunts
his
party
upon
all
occasions
they
intend
to
kill
him
that
is
why
he
wants
to
sell
it
is
good
to
know
this
since
it
gives
us
an
advantage
suleymân
arrived
we
all
three
breakfasted
on
slabs
of
country
bread
and
a
great
bowl
of
curds
and
then
went
out
to
view
that
old
land
the
sheykh
whose
name
was
yûsuf
and
his
sons
were
there
to
show
us
round
and
though
the
property
was
not
extensive
they
contrived
to
keep
us
there
till
noon
when
a
round
meal
was
spread
for
us
beneath
some
trees
and
after
that
was
finished
the
sheykh
availed
himself
of
some
remark
of
mine
to
start
the
whole
perambulation
once
again
at
last
it
came
to
mention
of
the
price
which
seemed
to
me
excessive
and
i
said
so
to
my
friends
rashîd
replied
course
the
business
has
not
yet
begun
and
the
next
day
we
shall
view
the
land
again
and
after
that
we
shall
arrange
for
the
appointment
of
two
valuers
one
for
us
and
one
for
him
who
will
inspect
the
land
first
separately
then
together
and
after
that
we
shall
appoint
an
arbiter
who
will
remonstrate
with
the
owner
of
the
land
and
after
that
the
business
will
take
months
is
the
proper
way
unless
your
honour
wishes
to
be
cheated
is
your
opinion
i
inquired
of
suleymân
land
is
good
and
capable
of
much
improvement
he
replied
all
the
trees
go
with
it
which
is
an
advantage
also
the
source
of
water
will
be
all
our
own
suleymân
repeated
this
remark
in
presence
of
the
crowd
of
villagers
whom
we
found
awaiting
our
return
before
my
house
at
once
there
rose
a
cry
yûsuf
is
a
liar
some
of
the
trees
do
not
belong
to
him
the
water
too
does
not
originate
upon
his
property
but
on
the
hill
above
so
can
be
cut
from
him
suleymân
was
talking
with
the
village
headman
when
he
returned
to
me
his
face
was
grave
is
it
i
inquired
the
sheykh
yûsuf
been
deceiving
us
he
shook
his
head
with
a
disgusted
frown
before
replying
it
is
these
others
who
are
lying
through
dislike
of
him
is
your
heart
set
upon
the
purchase
of
that
land
no
means
is
good
because
this
village
is
a
nest
of
hornets
the
headman
has
long
marked
that
land
out
for
his
own
were
we
to
pay
sheykh
yûsuf
a
good
price
for
it
enabling
him
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
with
honour
they
would
hate
us
and
work
for
our
discomfort
in
a
multitude
of
little
ways
we
will
call
upon
the
sheykh
and
cry
off
the
bargain
because
your
honour
caught
a
touch
of
fever
from
the
land
that
is
a
fair
excuse
we
proffered
it
upon
the
morrow
when
the
sheykh
yûsuf
received
it
with
a
scarce
veiled
sneer
seeming
extremely
mortified
directly
after
we
had
left
him
we
heard
later
he
went
down
to
the
tavern
by
the
village
spring
and
cursed
the
elders
who
had
turned
my
mind
against
him
in
unmeasured
terms
annoying
people
so
that
they
determined
there
and
then
to
make
an
end
of
him
next
morning
when
we
started
on
our
homeward
way
there
was
a
noise
of
firing
in
the
village
and
coming
round
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
in
single
file
we
saw
sheykh
yûsuf
seated
on
a
chair
against
the
wall
of
his
house
and
screened
by
a
great
olive
tree
the
slits
in
whose
old
trunk
made
perfect
loopholes
blazing
away
at
a
large
crowd
of
hostile
fellâhîn
he
used
in
turn
three
rifles
which
his
sons
kept
loading
for
him
he
was
seated
as
we
afterwards
found
out
because
he
had
been
shot
in
the
leg
i
was
for
dashing
to
his
rescue
and
rashîd
was
following
we
should
both
have
lost
our
lives
most
probably
if
suleymân
had
not
shouted
at
that
moment
in
stentorian
tones
in
the
name
of
the
sultan
and
all
the
powers
of
europe
desist
or
every
one
of
you
shall
surely
hang
such
words
aroused
the
people
curiosity
the
firing
ceased
while
we
rode
in
between
them
and
their
object
and
suleymân
assured
the
villagers
politely
that
i
was
the
right
hand
and
peculiar
agent
of
the
english
with
absolutely
boundless
power
to
hang
and
massacre
upon
the
other
hand
we
all
three
argued
with
sheykh
yûsuf
that
he
should
leave
the
place
at
once
and
lay
his
case
before
the
governor
will
go
with
him
said
suleymân
to
me
order
that
your
honour
may
be
made
acquainted
with
the
governor
a
person
whom
you
ought
to
know
his
property
will
not
be
damaged
in
his
absence
for
they
fear
the
law
the
heat
of
war
is
one
thing
and
malice
is
another
it
is
the
sight
and
sound
of
him
that
irritates
them
and
so
drives
them
to
excess
at
length
we
got
the
sheykh
on
horseback
and
upon
the
road
but
he
was
far
from
grateful
wishing
always
to
go
back
and
fight
we
could
not
get
a
civil
word
from
him
on
the
long
ride
and
just
before
we
reached
the
town
where
lived
the
governor
he
managed
to
escape
rashîd
flung
up
his
hands
when
we
first
noticed
his
defection
wonder
that
he
is
unpopular
he
cried
disgustedly
flee
from
us
his
benefactors
after
we
have
come
so
far
out
of
our
way
through
kindness
upon
his
account
it
is
abominable
who
under
allah
could
feel
love
for
such
a
man
chapter
xxii
the
caïmmacâm
though
the
reason
of
our
coming
the
sheykh
yûsuf
had
deserted
us
we
rode
into
the
town
and
spent
the
night
there
finding
lodgings
at
a
khan
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
place
of
which
the
yard
was
shaded
by
a
fine
old
carob
tree
while
we
were
having
breakfast
the
next
morning
in
a
kind
of
gallery
which
looked
into
the
branches
of
that
tree
and
through
them
and
a
ruined
archway
to
the
road
crowded
just
then
with
peasants
in
grey
clothing
coming
in
to
market
suleymân
proposed
that
he
and
i
should
go
and
call
upon
the
caïmmacâm
the
local
governor
i
had
spent
a
wretched
night
the
place
was
noisy
and
malodorous
my
one
desire
was
to
be
gone
as
soon
as
possible
and
so
i
answered
will
call
on
no
one
my
only
wish
to
see
him
was
upon
account
of
that
old
rogue
who
ran
away
from
us
man
was
certainly
ungrateful
curse
his
father
said
rashîd
man
is
to
be
pitied
being
ignorant
said
suleymân
one
idea
was
to
defend
his
house
and
land
by
combat
he
did
not
perceive
that
by
the
course
of
law
and
influence
he
might
defend
them
more
effectually
and
for
ever
he
probably
did
not
imagine
that
your
honour
would
yourself
approach
the
governor
and
plead
with
him
shall
see
nobody
i
answered
crossly
return
at
once
said
rashîd
get
the
horses
ready
yet
said
our
preceptor
thoughtfully
excellency
is
they
say
a
charming
man
and
this
would
be
a
golden
opportunity
for
us
to
get
acquainted
with
him
and
bespeak
his
favour
thus
the
sheykh
yûsuf
though
himself
contemptible
may
be
of
service
to
us
already
i
have
told
the
people
here
that
we
have
come
on
an
important
errand
to
the
governor
rashîd
too
as
i
know
has
spoken
of
the
matter
in
a
boastful
way
if
after
that
we
should
depart
in
dudgeon
without
seeing
him
there
would
be
gossip
and
perhaps
god
knows
even
political
disturbance
the
governor
coming
to
hear
of
it
might
reasonably
feel
aggrieved
he
argued
so
ridiculously
yet
so
gravely
that
in
the
end
i
was
obliged
to
yield
and
so
a
little
before
ten
we
sauntered
through
the
narrow
streets
to
the
government
offices
a
whitewashed
building
near
which
soldiers
loitered
in
a
dusty
square
there
we
waited
for
a
long
while
in
an
spacious
but
rather
dingy
with
cushionless
divans
around
the
walls
on
which
a
strange
variety
of
suitors
sat
or
squatted
some
of
these
appeared
so
poor
that
i
admired
their
boldness
in
demanding
audience
of
the
governor
yet
it
was
one
of
the
most
wretched
in
appearance
who
was
called
first
by
the
turbaned
usher
he
passed
into
an
inner
room
the
door
was
shut
then
suleymân
went
over
to
the
usher
who
kept
guard
upon
that
door
and
held
a
whispered
conversation
with
him
i
know
not
what
he
said
but
when
the
man
came
out
again
the
usher
slipped
into
the
inner
room
with
reverence
and
presently
returning
bowed
to
us
and
bade
us
enter
i
went
in
followed
by
suleymân
who
swelled
and
strutted
like
a
pouter
pigeon
in
his
flowing
robes
the
caïmmacâm
was
a
turk
of
extremely
neat
in
his
apparel
and
methodical
in
his
surroundings
he
might
have
been
an
englishman
but
for
the
crimson
fez
upon
his
brow
and
a
chaplet
of
red
beads
with
which
he
toyed
perpetually
he
gazed
into
my
eyes
with
kind
inquiry
i
told
him
that
i
came
with
tidings
of
a
grave
disturbance
in
his
district
and
then
left
suleymân
to
tell
the
story
of
sheykh
yûsuf
and
his
neighbours
and
the
battle
we
had
witnessed
in
the
olive
grove
before
his
house
suleymân
exhausted
all
his
powers
of
language
and
of
wit
making
a
veritable
poem
of
the
episode
the
governor
did
not
appear
profoundly
interested
yûsuf
who
is
he
he
asked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
tale
i
explained
that
the
sheykh
yûsuf
was
a
landowner
whose
acquaintance
we
had
made
through
my
desire
to
buy
some
property
honour
thinks
of
settling
here
among
us
cried
his
excellency
with
sudden
zest
appearing
quite
enraptured
with
the
notion
he
asked
then
if
the
french
tongue
was
intelligible
to
me
and
hearing
that
it
was
talked
long
in
french
about
my
project
which
seemed
to
please
him
greatly
he
said
that
it
would
be
a
blessing
for
his
district
to
have
a
highly
civilised
enlightened
being
like
myself
established
in
it
as
the
sun
and
centre
of
improvement
and
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
him
particularly
to
have
an
educated
man
at
hand
to
talk
to
he
hoped
that
when
i
had
set
up
my
model
farm
for
a
model
it
would
be
in
every
way
he
felt
quite
sure
of
that
from
my
appearance
and
my
conversation
i
would
not
limit
my
attention
solely
to
the
work
of
agriculture
but
would
go
on
to
improve
the
native
breeds
of
sheep
and
oxen
he
heard
that
splendid
strains
of
both
were
found
in
england
he
wished
me
to
import
a
lot
of
english
bulls
and
rams
assuring
me
of
the
assistance
of
the
government
in
all
that
i
might
do
in
that
direction
since
the
sultan
imperial
he
called
him
always
took
the
greatest
interest
in
such
experiments
all
this
was
very
far
from
my
original
design
which
was
to
lead
as
far
as
possible
a
quiet
life
but
i
promised
to
give
thought
to
all
his
excellency
counsels
he
made
me
smoke
two
cigarettes
and
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
which
his
secretary
had
prepared
upon
a
brazier
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
then
with
a
sweet
smile
and
deprecating
gestures
of
the
hands
he
begged
me
to
excuse
him
if
he
closed
the
interview
it
was
a
grief
to
him
to
let
me
go
but
he
was
very
busy
i
rose
at
once
and
so
did
suleymân
what
of
the
sheykh
yûsuf
i
exclaimed
reminding
him
to
be
sure
rejoined
the
governor
with
a
slight
frown
what
religion
is
he
suppose
a
druze
the
people
who
attacked
him
so
unmercifully
druzes
too
then
it
is
all
in
the
family
as
the
saying
goes
and
unless
some
deputation
from
the
druze
community
appeals
to
me
i
should
be
to
interfere
in
its
affairs
our
way
of
government
is
not
identical
with
that
which
is
pursued
with
such
conspicuous
success
in
highly
civilised
and
settled
countries
like
your
own
we
leave
the
various
communities
and
tribes
alone
to
settle
their
internal
differences
it
is
only
where
tribe
wars
on
tribe
religion
on
religion
or
their
quarrels
stop
the
traffic
on
the
sultan
highway
that
we
intervene
what
would
you
have
mon
ami
we
are
here
in
asia
with
these
words
and
a
smile
of
quite
ineffable
indulgence
for
my
young
illusions
his
excellency
bowed
me
out
in
the
suleymân
drew
close
to
my
left
ear
and
whispered
sharply
me
four
mejîdis
for
i
asked
in
deep
amazement
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
the
need
is
instant
i
produced
the
four
mejîdis
from
a
and
receiving
them
he
went
back
to
the
door
by
which
the
usher
stood
and
whispered
to
the
man
who
went
inside
a
moment
and
came
back
with
the
private
secretary
of
the
caïmmacâm
the
compliments
which
passed
between
them
seemed
to
me
interminable
i
paced
the
pavement
of
the
the
only
figure
in
the
crowd
whose
attitude
bespoke
impatience
the
others
sat
or
squatted
round
the
walls
in
perfect
resignation
some
of
them
smoking
others
munching
nuts
of
various
kinds
of
which
the
shells
began
to
hide
the
floor
adjacent
to
them
a
few
of
the
suppliants
had
even
had
the
forethought
to
bring
with
them
bags
full
of
provisions
as
if
anticipating
that
their
time
of
waiting
might
endure
for
several
days
at
last
when
i
was
growing
really
angry
with
him
suleymân
returned
and
told
me
is
well
and
we
can
now
be
going
if
your
honour
pleases
do
please
i
rejoined
indignantly
have
you
kept
me
waiting
all
this
while
i
never
wished
to
come
at
all
into
this
place
and
allah
knows
that
we
have
done
no
good
by
coming
we
have
spoilt
a
morning
which
we
might
have
spent
upon
the
road
allah
sighed
suleymân
honour
is
extremely
hard
to
please
did
not
his
excellency
talk
to
you
exclusively
with
every
sign
of
the
most
lively
pleasure
for
quite
half
an
hour
whereas
he
scarcely
deigned
to
throw
a
word
to
me
although
i
wooed
his
ear
with
language
calculated
to
seduce
the
mind
of
kings
i
have
some
cause
to
be
dejected
at
neglect
from
one
so
powerful
but
you
have
every
cause
to
be
elated
he
is
now
your
friend
shall
never
see
him
in
my
life
again
most
likely
i
objected
that
you
can
not
tell
replied
my
mentor
suavely
be
acquainted
with
a
person
in
authority
is
always
well
chapter
xxiii
concerning
bribes
did
you
want
those
four
mejîdis
i
inquired
severely
suleymân
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
replied
had
to
pay
the
proper
fees
since
you
yourself
showed
not
a
sign
of
doing
so
to
save
our
carefully
established
honour
and
good
name
do
mean
that
you
gave
them
to
the
caïmmacâm
forbid
consider
o
beloved
my
position
in
this
matter
to
put
it
in
the
form
of
parables
suppose
a
king
and
his
vizier
should
pay
a
visit
to
another
king
and
his
vizier
if
there
were
presents
to
be
made
i
ask
you
would
not
those
intended
for
the
king
be
offered
personally
by
the
king
and
those
for
the
vizier
by
the
vizier
it
will
be
obvious
to
your
honour
upon
slight
reflection
that
if
in
our
adventure
of
this
morning
a
present
to
the
governor
was
necessary
or
desirable
you
personally
and
no
other
creature
should
have
made
it
allah
i
exclaimed
would
have
knocked
me
down
would
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
being
completely
civilised
he
would
merely
have
pushed
back
your
hand
with
an
indulgent
smile
pressing
it
tenderly
as
who
should
say
thou
art
a
child
in
these
things
and
dost
not
know
our
ways
being
a
stranger
yet
undoubtedly
upon
the
whole
your
offer
of
a
gift
however
small
would
have
confirmed
the
good
opinion
which
he
formed
at
sight
of
you
let
that
pass
out
of
the
four
mejîdis
which
you
gave
me
so
reluctantly
since
you
ask
for
an
account
i
presented
one
to
the
usher
and
three
to
his
excellency
private
secretary
in
your
name
and
i
have
procured
it
of
the
secretary
kindness
that
he
will
urge
his
lord
to
take
some
measures
to
protect
that
ancient
malefactor
the
sheykh
yûsuf
i
had
tipped
the
governor
as
you
suggest
that
i
ought
to
have
done
i
interrupted
vehemently
you
mean
to
say
he
would
have
taken
measures
to
protect
sheykh
yûsuf
i
say
not
that
but
he
would
at
least
have
had
complete
conviction
that
your
honour
takes
a
lively
interest
in
that
old
churl
a
person
in
himself
unpleasant
and
unworthy
of
a
single
thought
from
any
thinking
or
individual
thus
even
though
he
scorned
the
money
as
he
would
no
doubt
have
done
the
offer
would
have
told
him
we
were
earnest
in
our
application
and
he
might
conceivably
have
taken
action
from
desire
to
do
a
pleasure
to
one
whom
as
i
said
before
he
loved
at
sight
whole
system
is
corrupt
i
said
what
is
worse
unreasonable
say
the
franks
replied
suleymân
shrugging
his
shoulders
up
and
spreading
wide
his
hands
as
though
before
a
wall
of
blind
stupidity
which
he
knew
well
could
never
be
cast
down
nor
yet
surmounted
governors
our
judges
and
the
crowd
of
small
officials
are
not
highly
paid
and
what
they
do
receive
is
paid
irregularly
then
all
whether
high
or
low
must
live
and
it
is
customary
in
our
land
to
offer
gifts
to
persons
in
authority
because
a
smile
god
knows
is
always
better
than
a
frown
from
such
an
one
we
are
not
like
the
franks
who
barter
everything
even
their
most
sacred
feelings
even
love
it
gives
us
pleasure
to
make
gifts
and
see
them
welcomed
even
when
the
recipient
is
someone
who
can
not
in
any
way
repay
us
for
our
trouble
as
a
frank
would
say
to
sell
justice
for
it
comes
to
that
i
cried
indignant
talks
of
selling
justice
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
i
have
to
go
before
a
judge
i
make
a
gift
beforehand
to
his
honour
whose
acceptance
tells
me
not
that
he
will
give
a
verdict
in
my
favour
do
not
think
it
but
merely
that
his
mind
contains
no
grudge
against
me
if
he
refused
the
gift
i
should
be
terrified
since
i
should
think
he
had
been
won
completely
by
the
other
side
to
take
gifts
from
both
parties
without
preference
making
allowance
when
there
is
occasion
for
the
man
who
is
too
poor
to
give
and
then
to
judge
entirely
on
the
merits
of
the
case
that
is
the
way
of
upright
judges
in
an
eastern
country
the
gifts
we
make
are
usually
small
whereas
the
fees
which
lawyers
charge
in
western
countries
are
exorbitant
as
you
yourself
have
told
me
more
than
once
and
i
have
heard
from
others
and
even
after
paying
those
enormous
fees
the
inoffensive
righteous
person
is
as
like
to
suffer
as
the
guilty
here
for
altogether
harmless
men
to
suffer
punishment
in
place
of
rogues
is
quite
though
occasionally
one
notorious
evildoer
may
be
punished
for
crime
when
this
is
great
and
the
real
criminal
can
not
be
found
and
there
is
call
for
an
example
to
be
made
upon
the
instant
this
generally
happens
when
a
foreign
consul
interferes
demanding
vengeance
for
some
slight
offence
against
his
nationals
things
like
that
take
place
occasionally
when
the
court
is
flustered
but
in
its
natural
course
believe
me
turkish
justice
if
is
as
good
as
that
of
europe
and
infinitely
less
expensive
than
your
english
law
i
made
no
answer
feeling
quite
bewildered
suleymân
was
always
serious
in
manner
which
made
it
very
hard
to
tell
when
he
was
joking
or
in
earnest
among
the
natives
of
the
land
i
knew
he
had
the
reputation
of
a
mighty
joker
but
i
had
learnt
the
fact
from
the
applause
of
others
i
never
should
have
guessed
from
his
demeanour
that
he
jested
consciously
he
also
held
his
peace
until
we
reached
our
hostelry
there
some
later
when
i
had
given
orders
for
our
horses
to
be
ready
for
a
start
directly
after
luncheon
a
decision
against
which
suleymân
protested
unsuccessfully
declaring
it
would
be
too
hot
for
riding
i
overheard
him
telling
the
whole
story
of
our
visit
including
the
donation
of
the
four
mejîdis
to
rashîd
who
was
lazily
engaged
in
polishing
my
horse
withers
secretary
is
a
man
of
breeding
he
was
saying
in
a
tone
of
warm
approval
i
noticed
he
was
careful
to
receive
the
present
in
his
left
hand
which
he
placed
behind
his
back
in
readiness
with
great
decorum
nor
did
he
thank
me
or
give
any
token
of
acknowledgment
beyond
a
little
friendly
twinkle
of
the
eyes
at
once
i
pounced
on
this
admission
crying
shows
that
he
regarded
the
transaction
as
unlawful
and
your
remark
upon
it
shows
that
you
too
think
it
so
suleymân
looked
slowly
round
until
his
eyes
met
mine
not
one
whit
disconcerted
though
until
i
spoke
he
had
not
known
that
i
was
anywhere
in
earshot
honour
is
incorrigible
he
replied
with
a
grave
smile
never
knew
your
like
for
obstinacy
in
a
false
opinion
which
shows
that
you
were
born
to
fill
some
high
position
in
the
world
of
course
they
all
these
fine
officials
great
and
small
regard
it
as
beneath
their
dignity
to
take
a
present
which
they
sorely
need
to
take
such
presents
greedily
would
be
to
advertise
their
poverty
to
all
the
world
and
government
appointments
swell
a
man
with
pride
if
nothing
else
a
pride
which
makes
them
anxious
to
be
thought
above
all
fear
of
want
for
that
cause
they
are
of
taking
gifts
but
no
one
in
this
country
thinks
it
wrong
of
them
to
do
so
nor
to
oblige
the
giver
if
they
can
in
little
ways
it
would
be
wrong
if
they
betrayed
the
trust
reposed
in
them
by
their
superiors
or
were
seduced
into
some
act
against
their
loyalty
or
their
religion
but
that
praise
be
to
god
you
will
not
find
it
is
only
in
small
matters
such
as
acts
of
commerce
or
politeness
which
hardly
come
within
the
sphere
of
a
man
conscience
that
they
are
procurable
and
no
one
in
this
country
thinks
the
worse
of
them
whatever
people
say
to
you
a
foreigner
by
way
of
flattery
it
is
very
difficult
for
foreigners
to
learn
the
truth
your
honour
should
be
thankful
that
you
have
suleymân
for
an
instructor
and
rashîd
too
he
added
as
an
seeing
that
my
bodyservant
stood
close
by
expecting
mention
and
after
more
than
twenty
years
experience
of
eastern
matters
i
know
now
that
he
was
right
chapter
xxiv
the
battlefield
our
road
the
merest
which
sometimes
altogether
disappeared
and
had
to
be
retrieved
by
guesswork
meandered
on
the
side
of
a
ravine
down
in
the
depths
of
which
in
groves
of
oleander
there
flowed
a
stream
of
which
we
caught
the
murmur
the
forest
was
continuous
on
our
side
of
the
wadi
it
consisted
of
dense
olive
groves
around
the
villages
and
a
much
thinner
growth
of
ilex
in
the
tracts
between
the
shade
was
pleasant
in
the
daytime
but
as
night
came
on
its
gloom
oppressed
our
spirits
with
extreme
concern
for
we
were
still
a
long
way
off
our
destination
and
uncertain
of
the
way
the
gloom
increased
from
open
places
here
and
there
we
saw
the
stars
but
gloom
filled
the
ravine
and
there
was
little
difference
between
the
darkness
underneath
the
trees
and
that
outside
in
open
spaces
of
the
grove
we
trusted
to
our
horses
to
make
out
the
path
which
sometimes
ran
along
the
verge
of
precipices
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
happy
in
my
mind
rashîd
made
matters
worse
by
dwelling
on
the
risks
we
ran
not
only
from
abandoned
men
but
ghouls
and
jinnis
the
lugubrious
call
of
a
hyæna
in
the
distance
moved
him
to
remark
that
ghouls
assume
that
shape
at
night
to
murder
travellers
they
come
up
close
and
rub
against
them
like
a
loving
cat
which
contact
robs
the
victims
of
their
intellect
and
causes
them
to
follow
the
hyæna
to
its
den
where
the
ghoul
kills
them
and
inters
their
bodies
till
the
flesh
is
ripe
he
next
expressed
a
fear
lest
we
might
come
upon
some
ruin
lighted
up
and
be
deceived
into
supposing
it
a
haunt
of
men
as
had
happened
to
a
worthy
cousin
of
his
own
when
on
a
journey
this
individual
whose
name
was
ali
had
been
transported
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
by
jinnis
from
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hamá
to
the
wilds
of
jebel
câf
mount
caucasus
and
had
escaped
a
hideous
and
painful
death
only
by
recollection
of
the
name
of
god
he
told
me
too
how
he
himself
when
stationed
at
mersîn
had
met
a
company
of
demons
one
fine
evening
in
returning
from
an
errand
and
other
tales
which
caused
my
flesh
to
creep
the
groves
receded
we
were
in
an
open
place
where
only
a
low
kind
of
brushwood
grew
when
suddenly
my
horse
shied
gave
a
fearful
snort
and
sturdily
refused
to
budge
another
inch
i
let
him
stand
until
rashîd
came
up
he
thought
to
pass
me
but
his
horse
refused
as
mine
had
done
is
no
doubt
some
jinni
in
the
way
he
whispered
in
a
frightened
tone
then
calling
out
ya
mubârak
permission
blessed
one
he
tried
to
urge
his
horse
which
still
demurred
so
there
we
were
arrested
by
some
unseen
hand
and
this
became
the
more
unpleasant
because
a
pestilential
smell
was
in
the
place
return
muttered
rashîd
with
chattering
teeth
me
a
match
i
said
distractedly
box
is
empty
return
he
pleaded
match
do
you
hear
i
cried
made
cross
by
terror
he
gave
the
match
and
i
believe
i
shouted
as
i
struck
it
for
a
brief
space
it
made
a
dazzle
in
my
eyes
preventing
me
from
seeing
anything
and
then
went
out
is
something
lying
in
the
path
rashîd
was
gibbering
i
got
down
off
my
horse
and
lit
a
second
match
which
i
took
care
to
shelter
till
the
flame
was
strong
a
human
arm
lay
in
the
path
before
us
my
horror
was
extreme
and
grew
uncanny
when
the
match
expired
but
the
ghastly
object
had
restored
his
courage
to
rashîd
who
even
laughed
aloud
as
he
exclaimed
praise
to
allah
it
is
nothing
which
can
hurt
us
no
doubt
some
murder
has
been
here
committed
all
unknown
the
lord
have
mercy
on
the
owner
of
that
arm
we
will
report
the
matter
to
some
high
official
at
our
journey
end
we
turned
our
horses
to
the
right
and
made
a
long
detour
but
scarcely
had
they
found
the
path
again
when
mine
which
led
the
way
demurred
once
more
piece
exclaimed
rashîd
excitedly
he
got
down
off
his
horse
to
look
many
pieces
this
by
allah
is
no
other
than
a
battlefield
unknown
to
fame
can
a
battle
take
place
without
public
knowledge
i
inquired
incredulous
thing
may
happen
when
two
factions
quarrel
for
unlawful
cause
it
may
be
over
stolen
gains
or
for
some
deadly
wrong
which
can
not
be
avowed
without
dishonour
and
when
each
side
exterminates
the
other
can
that
happen
i
exclaimed
again
rashîd
could
not
at
once
reply
because
in
our
avoidance
of
those
human
relics
we
found
ourselves
on
broken
ground
and
among
trunks
of
trees
which
called
for
the
address
of
all
our
wits
but
when
the
horses
once
more
plodded
steadily
he
assured
me
that
the
thing
could
happen
and
had
happened
often
in
that
country
where
men
blood
is
hot
he
told
me
how
a
band
of
brigands
once
in
had
fought
over
their
spoils
till
the
majority
on
both
sides
had
been
slain
and
the
survivors
were
so
badly
wounded
that
they
could
not
move
but
lay
and
died
upon
the
battlefield
and
how
the
people
of
two
villages
both
men
and
women
being
mad
with
envy
had
held
a
battle
with
the
same
result
i
interrupted
him
with
questions
both
of
us
were
glad
to
talk
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
remembrance
of
our
former
fear
we
gave
the
rein
to
our
imaginations
speaking
eagerly
reverting
to
the
severed
limbs
which
we
had
seen
rashîd
exclaimed
i
will
tell
your
honour
how
it
happened
a
deadly
insult
had
been
offered
to
a
family
in
a
young
girl
dishonour
her
father
and
her
brothers
killed
her
to
wipe
out
the
shame
as
is
the
custom
here
among
the
fellâhîn
and
then
with
all
their
relatives
waylaid
the
men
of
the
insulter
house
when
these
were
cutting
wood
here
in
the
forest
there
was
a
furious
battle
lasting
many
hours
the
combatants
fought
with
rustic
weapons
and
in
some
cases
tore
each
other
limb
from
limb
when
all
was
done
the
victors
were
themselves
so
sorely
wounded
that
they
were
able
to
do
nothing
but
lie
down
and
die
many
do
you
think
there
were
i
asked
believing
judge
by
scent
alone
not
one
or
two
but
allah
knows
perhaps
a
hundred
said
rashîd
reflectively
is
strange
they
should
have
lain
there
undiscovered
strange
when
one
remembers
that
the
spot
is
far
from
any
village
and
probably
as
far
from
the
right
road
was
his
reply
this
last
conjecture
was
disquieting
but
we
were
both
too
much
excited
for
anxiety
is
an
event
to
be
set
down
in
histories
rashîd
exclaimed
shall
be
famous
people
when
we
reach
the
village
such
news
is
heard
but
once
in
every
hundred
years
wish
that
we
could
reach
that
village
was
my
answer
and
again
we
fell
to
picturing
the
strange
event
at
length
we
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
in
the
far
distance
and
gave
praise
to
allah
a
later
we
saw
lights
ahead
of
us
but
that
did
not
mean
that
the
village
was
awake
rashîd
explained
to
me
for
among
the
people
of
that
country
sleep
without
a
light
is
to
be
destitute
a
little
later
rashîd
hammered
at
a
door
while
savage
dogs
bayed
round
us
making
rushes
at
his
heels
o
sons
of
honour
was
his
cry
great
calamity
and
when
the
door
was
opened
he
detailed
the
story
of
an
awful
fight
in
which
both
parties
of
belligerents
had
been
exterminated
are
torn
limb
from
limb
we
saw
the
relics
he
explained
you
have
any
doubt
question
my
lord
who
is
out
here
behind
me
a
great
one
of
the
english
famed
for
his
veracity
and
i
was
ready
to
confirm
each
word
he
said
in
a
very
little
while
that
village
was
astir
it
was
the
seat
of
a
mudîr
who
had
two
soldiers
at
his
beck
and
call
the
great
man
was
aroused
from
sleep
he
questioned
us
and
as
the
result
of
the
inquiry
sent
the
soldiers
with
us
to
survey
the
battlefield
a
crowd
of
peasants
armed
with
and
carrying
lanterns
came
with
the
party
out
of
curiosity
our
horses
having
had
enough
of
travel
we
went
back
on
foot
amid
the
noisy
crowd
who
questioned
us
incessantly
about
the
strange
event
the
murmur
of
our
going
filled
the
wood
and
echoed
from
the
rocks
above
by
the
time
we
reached
the
place
where
we
had
seen
the
human
limbs
the
dawn
was
up
to
make
our
lanterns
useless
rashîd
and
i
were
certain
of
the
spot
we
came
upon
it
with
a
thrill
of
apprehension
but
there
was
nothing
there
seek
refuge
in
allah
gasped
rashîd
in
pious
awe
swear
by
my
salvation
it
was
here
we
saw
them
the
name
of
god
be
round
about
us
it
is
devilry
our
escort
was
divided
in
opinion
some
thinking
we
had
been
indeed
the
sport
of
devils
others
that
we
lied
but
someone
sniffed
and
said
is
a
smell
of
death
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
smell
at
any
rate
then
one
of
the
mudîr
two
soldiers
searching
in
the
brushwood
cried
have
the
remnant
of
an
arm
and
then
an
old
man
of
the
village
smote
his
leg
and
cried
my
friends
i
see
it
here
is
neither
lies
nor
devilry
laughing
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
bade
me
come
with
him
we
went
a
little
way
into
the
wood
and
there
he
showed
me
three
druze
tombs
deep
in
the
shade
of
ilex
trees
small
buildings
made
of
stone
and
mud
like
little
houses
each
with
an
opening
level
with
the
ground
and
a
much
smaller
opening
like
a
window
at
the
height
of
a
elbow
seest
cried
my
tutor
are
graves
the
openings
on
the
ground
were
made
too
large
and
jackals
have
got
in
and
pulled
the
bodies
out
the
men
who
made
those
graves
are
foolish
people
who
have
wandered
from
the
truth
they
think
the
spirits
of
the
dead
have
need
of
food
and
light
and
also
of
a
hole
for
crawling
in
and
out
i
heard
thee
ask
thy
servant
for
a
match
just
now
come
i
will
show
thee
where
to
find
one
always
he
led
me
to
the
nearest
tomb
and
thrust
my
hand
into
the
little
hole
which
served
as
window
it
touched
a
heap
of
matches
which
he
bade
me
take
and
put
into
my
pocket
saying
is
not
a
theft
for
the
matches
have
been
thrown
away
as
you
might
say
those
foolish
people
will
suppose
the
dead
have
struck
them
they
used
to
put
wax
candles
and
with
them
in
the
niches
but
when
these
sulphur
matches
came
in
fashion
they
preferred
them
for
economy
when
i
am
working
in
this
wood
i
take
no
fire
with
me
being
quite
sure
to
find
the
means
of
lighting
one
praise
be
to
allah
for
some
people
folly
i
thanked
him
for
the
wrinkle
and
went
back
to
join
rashîd
who
was
exclaiming
with
the
others
over
our
deception
but
everyone
agreed
that
the
mistake
was
natural
for
men
bewildered
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
chapter
xxv
murderers
rashîd
and
i
were
riding
down
to
tripoli
and
had
long
been
looking
for
a
certain
or
refreshment
booth
beside
the
road
which
an
enterprising
christian
of
that
town
had
opened
in
the
summer
months
for
the
relief
of
travellers
when
at
length
we
came
in
sight
of
it
we
saw
a
crowd
of
men
reposing
on
the
ground
before
its
awning
we
soon
lost
sight
of
them
again
in
a
ravine
and
it
was
not
till
we
were
close
upon
them
climbing
up
the
other
bank
that
i
remarked
that
most
of
them
were
shackled
and
in
charge
of
a
small
guard
of
turkish
soldiers
upon
their
way
to
the
hard
labour
prison
said
rashîd
have
they
done
i
asked
as
we
dismounted
he
strolled
across
and
put
a
question
to
their
escort
then
returned
and
told
me
are
murderers
after
that
information
it
surprised
me
while
we
ate
our
luncheon
to
observe
their
open
faces
and
to
hear
them
laugh
and
chatter
with
their
guards
already
i
had
learnt
that
crime
in
eastern
countries
is
not
regarded
altogether
as
it
is
with
us
that
orientals
do
not
know
that
shrinking
from
contamination
which
marks
the
behaviour
towards
a
breaker
of
his
country
law
but
i
was
unprepared
for
this
indulgence
towards
a
gang
of
murderers
it
interested
me
and
seeing
that
rashîd
was
talking
with
them
in
a
friendly
way
i
gathered
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
their
proximity
and
myself
drew
near
when
i
had
finished
eating
and
gave
them
cigarettes
they
thanked
me
loudly
the
smile
of
pleasure
on
each
face
expressed
a
childlike
innocence
one
only
sat
apart
in
gloom
conforming
in
some
measure
to
my
preconceived
idea
of
what
a
murderer
upon
his
way
to
prison
ought
to
look
like
i
noticed
with
surprise
that
this
one
wore
no
chain
i
went
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
it
was
only
then
that
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
i
was
wishing
him
to
take
a
cigarette
he
did
so
quickly
and
saluted
me
without
a
word
one
of
the
others
said
in
tender
tones
him
not
o
my
lord
for
he
is
mad
with
sorrow
he
is
more
luckless
than
the
rest
of
us
may
allah
help
him
he
killed
the
person
he
loved
best
on
earth
his
only
brother
it
is
true
that
you
are
murderers
i
asked
still
allah
it
is
true
alas
and
we
are
paying
for
it
by
a
enslavement
year
no
more
than
that
i
cried
killing
men
is
it
not
enough
o
lord
of
kindness
it
is
not
as
if
we
had
killed
men
from
malice
or
desire
of
gain
we
killed
in
sudden
anger
or
in
the
case
of
three
among
us
in
a
it
is
from
allah
and
we
ask
forgiveness
did
that
man
kill
i
questioned
pointing
to
the
apathetic
figure
of
the
fratricide
which
attracted
my
imagination
by
its
loneliness
suffered
persecutions
from
a
rich
man
of
his
village
who
was
his
rival
for
the
favour
of
a
certain
girl
so
it
is
said
those
persecutions
maddened
him
at
times
one
day
when
he
was
mad
like
that
his
brother
came
to
him
and
spoke
some
word
of
blame
upon
another
matter
he
killed
him
as
he
might
have
killed
his
wife
and
children
or
himself
being
in
that
state
of
mind
devoid
of
reason
when
he
awoke
and
saw
what
he
had
done
he
wished
to
kill
himself
is
from
allah
his
remorse
is
punishment
exclaimed
rashîd
should
he
go
to
prison
he
has
had
enough
of
this
country
would
have
thought
of
punishment
for
him
replied
the
spokesman
of
the
murderers
with
rueful
smile
his
brother
was
the
servant
of
a
foreign
merchant
a
greek
from
overseas
i
think
it
was
who
put
the
business
in
his
consul
hands
and
so
the
speaker
clicked
his
thumbnail
on
his
white
front
teeth
to
signify
finality
the
poor
man
himself
does
not
object
it
seems
indeed
that
he
is
glad
to
go
with
us
perhaps
by
labour
and
harsh
treatment
he
may
be
relieved
as
there
were
still
provisions
in
our
rashîd
by
my
command
divided
them
among
the
company
the
soldiers
and
the
murderers
alike
who
were
delighted
it
was
a
merry
party
which
we
left
behind
with
the
exception
of
the
fratricide
who
ate
the
food
when
it
was
set
before
him
ravenously
but
said
not
a
word
allah
heal
him
sighed
the
other
murderers
lord
remove
this
shadow
from
his
mind
rashîd
and
i
pursued
our
way
on
an
interminable
path
meandering
in
down
through
brushwood
which
smelt
sweet
of
myrtle
and
wild
incense
i
tried
to
make
him
understand
that
he
had
quite
misled
me
by
the
term
he
had
applied
to
men
who
had
been
guilty
of
no
more
than
manslaughter
the
distinction
had
to
be
explained
with
much
periphrasis
because
the
arabic
word
means
a
slayer
and
is
given
indiscriminately
to
all
who
kill
he
caught
my
meaning
sooner
than
i
had
expected
he
said
honour
thought
from
what
i
said
that
they
were
cutters
of
the
road
or
hired
assassins
who
kill
men
for
gain
those
are
the
greater
criminals
whose
punishment
is
death
few
such
exist
among
us
here
a
robber
will
seldom
kill
a
man
unless
that
man
kills
him
i
translate
literally
it
is
just
retaliation
and
as
for
hired
assassins
i
have
known
several
of
them
in
my
time
and
they
are
not
bad
people
but
unfortunate
having
fallen
early
in
the
power
of
cruel
and
ambitious
men
most
of
the
killing
in
this
country
is
done
without
a
thought
in
anger
or
mad
jealousy
it
for
man
to
judge
them
he
exclaimed
with
a
high
shrug
when
i
remarked
upon
their
friendly
treatment
by
the
turkish
guards
are
punished
by
authority
down
here
so
we
are
better
but
afterwards
when
comes
the
judgment
of
the
lord
we
may
be
worse
it
is
hard
upon
those
men
we
met
just
now
they
go
to
prison
most
of
them
because
they
were
not
rich
enough
to
pay
the
sum
demanded
as
the
price
of
blood
for
men
of
wealth
or
who
have
rich
relations
it
is
easy
to
compound
the
matter
for
a
sum
of
money
in
return
for
which
the
dead
man
relatives
regard
his
death
as
due
to
natural
causes
and
forswear
revenge
it
is
hard
i
say
upon
those
men
we
met
just
now
and
especially
upon
the
man
who
slew
his
brother
may
our
lord
console
him
a
few
days
later
i
was
strolling
in
the
town
and
happened
to
pass
by
the
public
gaol
in
the
middle
of
the
gate
behind
some
iron
bars
a
wretched
man
stood
shaking
a
tin
can
in
which
some
small
coins
rattled
and
calling
on
the
for
alms
for
the
poor
prisoners
a
little
group
of
english
tourists
a
gentleman
and
two
fair
ladies
came
that
way
led
on
by
a
resplendent
dragoman
they
stared
at
the
wild
figure
at
the
prison
gate
like
to
give
a
trifle
to
the
brisoners
inquired
the
guide
are
they
in
for
asked
the
gentleman
i
guess
mostly
shrugged
the
dragoman
not
replied
the
gentleman
with
indignation
i
ventured
to
approach
and
tell
him
that
they
were
not
murderers
in
our
sense
of
the
word
and
that
they
depended
for
a
bare
subsistence
upon
public
charity
the
only
thanks
i
got
were
a
cold
stare
from
the
man
a
fastidious
grimace
from
the
two
ladies
and
an
indeed
so
arrogant
in
tone
that
i
retired
discomfited
my
may
be
attributable
to
the
fact
that
i
was
wearing
a
and
and
so
appeared
to
them
as
what
is
called
a
i
myself
have
always
since
that
day
felt
it
my
duty
to
give
alms
to
murderers

xxvi
the
trees
on
the
land
my
search
for
an
estate
provided
us
with
an
excuse
for
visiting
all
sorts
of
places
and
scraping
acquaintance
with
all
sorts
of
curious
people
in
some
villages
we
were
greeted
with
unbounded
glee
in
others
with
a
sullen
gruff
endurance
far
from
welcome
but
though
the
flavour
of
reception
varied
we
were
everywhere
received
with
some
degree
of
hospitality
and
shown
what
we
desired
to
see
thus
we
surveyed
a
great
variety
of
properties
none
of
which
fulfilled
my
chief
requirements
i
wanted
both
a
house
in
which
i
should
not
feel
ashamed
to
live
and
cultivable
land
enough
to
yield
a
revenue
and
the
two
together
seemed
impossible
to
find
at
least
for
the
sum
of
money
which
was
placed
at
my
disposal
one
piece
of
land
attracted
us
so
much
that
we
remained
in
the
adjacent
village
a
full
week
returning
every
day
to
wander
over
it
trying
to
see
if
it
could
not
be
made
to
fit
my
needs
it
consisted
of
a
grove
of
fine
old
olive
trees
with
terraces
of
fig
and
mulberry
trees
and
vegetables
spread
out
to
catch
the
morning
sun
upon
a
mountain
side
sloping
to
a
wooded
valley
walled
by
rocky
heights
water
was
there
in
plenty
but
no
house
to
speak
of
the
three
small
houses
on
the
property
being
in
the
occupation
which
amounts
to
ownership
of
workers
of
the
land
who
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
would
become
my
partners
upon
the
other
hand
the
land
was
fairly
cheap
and
after
paying
for
it
i
should
have
a
balance
with
which
i
might
begin
to
build
a
proper
house
for
as
suleymân
remarked
all
things
are
done
gradually
no
one
will
expect
to
see
a
palace
all
at
once
begin
with
two
rooms
and
a
stable
and
add
a
fresh
room
every
time
that
you
have
forty
pounds
to
spare
the
price
of
building
appeared
fixed
in
all
that
countryside
at
forty
pounds
a
vault
which
in
ordinary
buildings
means
a
room
since
every
room
is
vaulted
the
trouble
was
to
see
just
where
to
put
the
house
without
encroaching
upon
profitable
land
at
last
i
hit
on
a
position
in
the
middle
of
the
highest
terrace
on
which
grew
olive
trees
so
very
old
that
they
could
well
be
sacrificed
having
arrived
at
this
decision
i
sat
down
among
those
trees
and
gazed
in
rapture
at
the
view
across
the
valley
it
was
indeed
a
grand
position
for
a
house
rashîd
exclaimed
dwelling
will
be
seen
afar
the
traveller
on
distant
roads
will
see
its
windows
flashing
and
will
certainly
inquire
the
owner
name
yet
would
i
rather
it
had
faced
the
evening
sun
because
more
people
are
abroad
at
sunset
than
at
dawn
morning
sun
is
better
for
the
growth
of
plants
and
it
comports
the
evening
shadow
which
is
most
agreeable
murmured
suleymân
who
stretched
his
length
upon
the
ground
before
us
chewing
a
with
an
air
of
wisdom
as
we
were
there
conversing
lazily
one
of
the
in
the
land
came
through
the
trees
bringing
a
tray
with
cups
of
coffee
which
he
had
prepared
for
our
refreshment
lord
preserve
thy
hands
o
câsim
sighed
suleymân
comest
at
the
very
moment
when
my
soul
said
coffee
the
peasant
câsim
beamed
with
pleasure
at
the
thanks
we
showered
on
him
and
squatting
down
inquired
if
we
had
yet
decided
anything
i
replied
we
shall
cut
down
these
three
olive
trees
and
put
the
house
instead
of
them
at
that
his
smile
gave
place
to
grave
concern
he
said
may
not
be
not
i
asked
we
have
no
right
to
touch
these
trees
the
sheykh
ali
told
me
that
this
terrace
was
his
property
is
so
as
to
the
land
the
trees
are
different
whom
then
do
these
trees
belong
different
people
can
i
know
which
trees
are
ours
which
theirs
honour
need
not
trouble
they
are
able
to
distinguish
they
must
walk
upon
our
land
to
reach
their
trees
a
doubt
it
is
unheard
of
but
it
has
been
the
way
since
noah
flood
your
honour
condescends
to
read
the
bible
he
will
notice
that
in
the
bargain
which
our
lord
abraham
made
for
the
cave
of
machpelah
the
trees
upon
the
land
are
mentioned
separately
put
in
suleymân
who
had
a
mind
i
took
no
notice
but
continued
my
alarmed
inquiries
many
people
own
these
trees
or
thirty
they
trample
on
our
land
case
is
so
is
their
chief
know
not
but
the
largest
share
they
say
is
vested
in
muhammad
abu
hasan
his
share
of
all
the
trees
is
twelve
kîrâts
as
much
as
all
the
others
put
together
they
say
so
only
allah
knows
the
truth
should
like
to
speak
to
this
muhammad
abu
hasan
my
head
i
go
to
fetch
him
answered
câsim
touching
his
brow
in
token
of
obedience
when
he
was
gone
suleymân
observed
significantly
naught
to
do
with
all
these
fathers
of
kîrâts
when
once
the
word
kîrât
is
mentioned
flee
the
place
for
you
may
be
assured
that
it
is
the
abode
of
all
bedevilment
when
once
a
man
is
father
of
but
one
or
two
kîrâts
he
has
the
power
of
forty
thousand
for
unreasoning
annoyance
what
in
mercy
name
is
a
kîrât
i
questioned
kîrât
replied
rashîd
as
usual
eager
to
explain
that
term
into
which
all
things
visible
and
invisible
are
resolved
and
subdivided
secretly
or
may
be
subdivided
at
a
person
pleasure
a
kîrât
is
that
which
has
no
real
existence
unless
a
group
of
men
agree
together
saying
it
is
here
or
there
a
kîrât
suleymân
cut
short
his
explanation
saying
simply
kîrât
is
the
part
of
anything
if
my
soul
is
sick
i
ask
the
doctor
how
many
kîrâts
of
hope
and
according
to
his
answer
four
or
twenty
i
feel
gladness
or
despair
to
own
but
one
kîrât
in
this
concern
of
property
is
sometimes
better
than
to
own
all
the
remaining
as
witness
the
affair
of
johha
the
greatest
wiseacre
this
country
has
produced
johha
owned
a
house
consisting
of
a
single
room
wishing
to
make
a
little
money
he
let
his
house
to
people
for
a
yearly
rent
which
they
paid
in
advance
reserving
to
himself
the
use
of
only
one
kîrât
of
it
to
show
where
his
kîrât
was
situated
johha
drove
a
peg
into
the
wall
inside
after
the
tenants
had
been
in
a
week
he
brought
a
bag
of
beans
and
hung
it
on
his
peg
no
one
objected
he
was
exercising
his
free
right
a
few
days
later
he
removed
the
bag
of
beans
and
hung
up
garlic
in
its
place
again
a
few
days
and
he
came
with
an
old
cat
which
had
been
some
time
dead
and
so
on
bringing
ever
more
offensive
things
until
the
tenants
were
obliged
to
leave
the
house
and
forfeit
their
year
rent
without
redress
since
johha
was
within
his
rights
therefore
i
say
to
you
beware
these
fathers
of
kîrâts
will
spoil
the
property
rashîd
gave
an
appreciative
chuckle
and
was
going
to
relate
some
story
of
his
own
but
just
then
câsim
reappeared
attended
not
by
one
man
only
but
a
score
of
men
the
owners
of
the
trees
as
it
immediately
appeared
for
they
cried
out
as
they
came
up
that
it
would
be
a
sin
for
us
to
cut
them
down
i
asked
them
to
elect
a
spokesman
as
i
could
not
deal
with
all
at
once
and
muhammad
abu
hasan
was
pushed
forward
he
squatted
facing
me
upon
the
ground
his
men
behind
him
the
twigs
and
leaves
of
olives
overhead
spread
a
filigree
of
moving
shade
upon
their
puckered
faces
they
were
evidently
much
perturbed
in
mind
i
asked
them
for
how
much
they
would
consent
to
sell
those
trees
showing
the
three
i
wished
to
fell
to
clear
a
space
for
building
freehold
meanest
thou
inquired
their
spokesman
anxiously
for
five
hundred
pounds
but
we
would
sell
a
share
want
no
share
i
want
to
cut
them
down
at
that
there
was
a
general
outcry
that
it
must
not
be
trees
would
remain
yours
until
the
end
i
told
them
i
would
let
you
have
the
wood
for
your
own
purposes
and
in
addition
you
would
have
a
pretty
sum
of
money
there
ensued
a
long
and
whispered
consultation
before
muhammad
abu
hasan
answered
me
at
length
he
said
may
not
be
behold
we
all
are
the
descendants
of
one
man
who
owned
these
trees
in
ancient
days
but
we
are
not
brothers
nor
yet
uncles
children
and
there
is
jealousy
among
us
we
quarrel
near
to
fighting
every
year
about
the
produce
of
these
trees
each
man
perceiving
that
he
has
been
cheated
of
his
proper
share
but
that
is
not
so
very
serious
for
each
man
hopes
that
next
year
he
will
get
a
larger
share
in
compensation
suppose
instead
of
trees
which
bear
fruit
every
year
we
had
a
sum
of
money
in
that
case
the
division
would
admit
of
no
redress
and
those
who
thought
themselves
defrauded
would
bear
lifelong
malice
therefore
i
say
we
will
not
have
those
trees
cut
down
but
we
are
prepared
upon
the
other
hand
to
sell
you
all
our
trees
upon
this
terrace
if
you
on
your
side
will
assign
to
us
but
two
kîrâts
of
all
your
trees
these
trees
included
destroy
the
dwelling
of
your
two
kîrâts
i
cried
out
angrily
will
have
none
of
them
nor
will
i
make
my
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
men
so
foolish
i
shall
seek
elsewhere
the
peasants
chuckled
at
my
curse
on
the
kîrâts
they
murmured
an
apology
but
seemed
relieved
as
they
went
off
suleymân
who
had
to
leave
us
on
the
following
day
then
gave
me
good
advice
he
said
is
no
use
for
thee
to
deal
with
little
people
who
wish
to
make
the
most
of
their
small
lands
who
have
mean
dirty
houses
thou
hast
a
friend
among
the
great
sheykhs
of
the
drûz
go
to
him
in
his
castle
and
explain
thy
wish
he
owns
a
score
of
noble
houses
which
he
does
not
use
and
for
the
love
of
thee
he
will
not
count
the
price
too
closely
moreover
he
will
think
that
showing
favour
to
an
englishman
he
will
earn
the
good
opinion
of
the
british
government
he
has
political
ambitions
all
great
men
are
fools
or
malefactors
is
the
best
of
counsel
said
rashîd
and
having
nothing
else
in
mind
we
acted
on
it
chapter
xxvii
buying
a
house
even
great
men
in
the
east
rise
early
so
when
i
arrived
before
the
castle
of
the
great
druze
chief
at
six
of
a
summer
morning
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
a
crowd
of
and
mountaineers
already
waiting
for
an
audience
of
his
grace
nor
yet
when
i
had
gained
admittance
as
a
favoured
person
to
find
the
chief
himself
afoot
and
wide
awake
what
did
surprise
me
was
to
see
him
clad
in
stambûli
and
all
its
stiff
accompaniments
at
an
hour
when
even
the
most
civilised
of
pashas
still
wears
native
dress
he
heard
of
my
desire
to
settle
in
his
country
with
surprise
and
seeming
pleasure
and
made
me
sit
beside
him
on
a
sofa
in
an
upper
chamber
of
magnificent
proportions
spoilt
to
my
taste
by
gaudy
frankish
furniture
and
certain
oleographs
of
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
which
adorned
its
walls
he
thought
as
is
the
way
of
orientals
visibly
with
finger
pressed
to
brow
then
he
exclaimed
have
a
house
close
by
across
the
glen
a
little
ruinous
perhaps
but
we
can
soon
repair
it
come
to
the
window
you
can
see
the
place
from
here
he
pointed
out
a
kind
of
thickset
tower
which
crowned
a
pretty
village
set
in
orchards
you
care
to
see
it
we
will
go
there
when
i
have
received
my
people
he
invited
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
reception
but
having
seen
the
crowd
outside
i
thought
it
wisdom
to
go
back
rather
to
the
village
khan
where
i
had
left
my
horse
to
warn
rashîd
to
have
things
ready
for
a
start
and
get
some
breakfast
i
returned
in
two
hours
time
to
find
the
chief
already
mounted
on
a
splendid
charger
led
by
a
no
less
splendid
servant
setting
forth
in
search
of
me
half
the
world
for
tail
as
rashîd
put
it
it
was
in
truth
a
long
procession
which
meandered
down
the
steep
and
rocky
pathway
deep
in
the
shade
of
walls
and
overhanging
trees
to
the
ravine
forded
the
stream
and
climbed
the
other
bank
the
village
when
we
reached
it
was
in
great
commotion
all
its
people
crowding
to
the
wide
meydân
or
levelled
ground
for
horsemanship
spread
out
before
the
house
which
might
be
mine
in
the
midst
of
this
meydân
there
was
a
fine
old
carob
tree
with
a
stone
bench
all
round
the
foot
of
its
enormous
trunk
the
house
itself
was
an
old
fortress
built
of
solid
stone
with
arrow
slits
as
well
as
modern
windows
and
an
arched
doorway
at
the
top
of
wide
stone
steps
against
it
nestled
lesser
houses
of
the
village
which
seemed
to
climb
up
towards
it
for
protection
some
men
of
consequence
came
forth
to
greet
the
chief
who
then
dismounted
with
their
servile
aid
he
introduced
me
to
a
turbaned
druze
of
reverend
appearance
who
he
said
at
present
occupied
the
house
and
also
to
the
son
of
the
said
turbaned
druze
who
knew
a
little
french
and
longed
to
air
it
the
turbaned
one
whose
name
was
sheykh
huseyn
was
called
on
to
refresh
his
chieftain
memory
with
regard
to
various
details
of
the
house
and
property
and
all
the
feudal
rights
and
privileges
appertaining
thereunto
he
did
so
as
in
duty
bound
but
in
a
very
mournful
tone
his
son
explained
tu
fiens
habiter
nous
defons
quitter
mon
bère
bas
quitter
très
bon
marché
from
which
i
guessed
that
they
had
occupied
the
house
till
they
had
come
to
look
upon
it
as
their
own
leaving
aside
the
land
which
we
should
visit
presently
the
owner
of
the
house
i
was
informed
had
jurisdiction
over
the
meydân
which
was
in
times
of
peace
the
village
square
and
owned
part
of
the
great
tree
in
its
midst
he
also
owned
a
fifth
of
all
the
water
flowing
or
to
flow
from
the
great
village
spring
and
had
the
right
to
call
upon
the
fellâhîn
for
one
day
work
a
year
in
return
for
his
protection
of
their
land
from
enemies
when
i
inquired
by
what
means
i
could
possibly
secure
my
fifth
share
of
the
water
from
the
spring
the
chief
informed
me
that
the
stipulation
was
in
case
the
source
diminished
in
dry
seasons
which
thank
the
lord
it
never
yet
had
done
we
viewed
the
house
and
i
was
pleased
with
the
great
vaulted
rooms
in
which
the
pots
and
pans
and
bedding
of
the
sheykh
huseyn
appeared
like
nothing
and
the
women
of
the
family
of
sheykh
huseyn
against
our
inroad
made
themselves
exceeding
small
and
then
remounting
we
went
off
to
view
the
land
this
was
scattered
all
about
the
mountain
side
a
terrace
here
a
terrace
there
it
took
us
a
long
while
to
see
the
whole
of
it
the
chief
fatigued
alighted
and
sat
down
beneath
some
walnut
trees
he
ordered
sheykh
huseyn
to
cause
refreshments
to
appear
the
latter
shouted
and
a
dozen
villagers
went
tearing
off
in
a
very
little
time
a
meal
of
honeyed
cakes
and
fruit
was
set
before
us
and
the
ceremony
of
making
coffee
was
in
progress
on
a
brazier
near
us
in
the
shade
allah
sighed
the
sheykh
huseyn
telling
his
beads
bère
est
triste
tu
vois
il
aime
bas
quitter
murmured
his
hopeful
son
in
tones
of
high
delight
the
feeling
proper
to
express
before
a
new
acquaintance
of
my
quality
the
religion
of
these
flies
it
is
extremely
hot
exclaimed
the
chief
in
momentary
irritation
the
trees
went
with
the
land
without
exception
i
was
glad
to
hear
of
all
the
produce
of
that
land
of
any
kind
whatever
would
be
mine
the
rest
belonging
to
the
husbandmen
by
immemorial
right
there
was
never
such
a
thing
as
wages
for
the
cultivation
of
the
land
the
sheykh
huseyn
implored
us
to
return
to
luncheon
at
his
house
protesting
that
he
had
commanded
a
great
feast
to
be
prepared
but
the
chief
declared
we
were
too
busy
to
allow
ourselves
that
pleasure
as
we
were
then
some
way
below
the
village
we
did
not
go
back
thither
but
rode
off
along
a
path
through
orchards
till
we
found
the
road
to
the
ravine
at
taking
leave
the
eyes
of
sheykh
huseyn
met
mine
a
moment
they
were
large
benevolent
brown
eyes
and
they
expressed
much
inward
sorrow
while
on
his
lips
there
broke
the
smile
demanded
of
politeness
refoir
mon
cher
au
blaisir
cried
his
hopeful
son
rashîd
came
up
behind
me
as
we
rode
along
and
poured
into
my
ear
a
wondrous
tale
of
how
the
sheykh
huseyn
was
our
and
would
do
his
best
to
make
things
lively
for
us
if
we
took
the
place
he
had
conversed
with
people
of
the
village
while
we
viewed
the
house
the
majority
are
in
our
favour
he
assured
me
with
grave
satisfaction
do
not
love
the
sheykh
huseyn
who
is
a
miser
and
a
hypocrite
they
say
please
god
we
shall
humiliate
him
to
the
very
depth
of
shame
he
spoke
as
if
we
were
at
war
and
within
sight
of
victory
as
if
we
were
already
settled
in
the
place
and
i
was
glad
because
it
augured
well
for
my
content
if
i
should
buy
the
place
which
i
was
now
resolved
to
do
if
i
could
anyhow
afford
it
price
will
be
too
great
i
fear
was
my
reply
whereat
he
sighed
observing
that
the
place
was
of
a
nature
to
exalt
our
honour
returning
to
the
castle
of
the
chieftain
i
was
ushered
to
his
private
chamber
where
i
broached
at
once
the
burning
question
of
the
price
he
said
knows
i
wish
to
give
thee
house
and
land
since
thou
desirest
them
but
i
have
a
mortgage
on
some
other
lands
of
mine
which
vexes
me
because
though
i
can
find
the
interest
which
is
exorbitant
each
year
i
can
not
in
this
country
lay
my
hands
upon
the
principal
discharge
that
debt
for
me
and
god
reward
thee
take
the
house
and
land
he
named
a
sum
of
money
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
it
was
so
little
as
compared
with
what
i
judged
to
be
the
value
of
the
property
it
was
well
within
the
sum
at
my
disposal
i
wished
to
write
a
cheque
out
there
and
then
but
he
forbade
me
saying
knows
i
might
mislay
the
paper
or
destroy
it
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
do
thou
in
kindness
pay
my
creditor
and
bring
me
the
discharge
he
named
an
armenian
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
an
amiable
learned
man
of
modest
means
the
last
person
in
the
country
whom
i
should
have
thought
a
usurer
nor
was
he
one
habitually
for
he
himself
informed
me
that
this
loan
to
the
druze
chieftain
was
his
sole
investment
of
the
kind
i
called
on
him
one
afternoon
in
the
city
and
handed
him
my
cheque
explaining
how
the
matter
stood
do
me
a
bad
turn
unlucky
day
he
sighed
as
he
received
it
little
fortune
was
more
safe
with
him
than
in
a
bank
and
every
year
it
brought
me
in
a
pretty
income
where
can
i
find
another
such
investment
with
groans
he
wrote
out
the
receipt
which
in
due
time
i
carried
to
the
chief
who
thanked
me
and
assured
me
that
the
house
was
mine
and
should
be
made
so
formally
i
then
rode
over
to
the
house
again
and
with
rashîd
planned
out
the
changes
we
desired
to
make
the
sheykh
huseyn
following
us
about
gloomily
and
his
cheerful
son
bestowing
on
us
his
advice
in
broken
french
they
knew
their
tenancy
was
at
an
end
the
sheykh
resigned
at
length
to
the
inevitable
sought
to
establish
good
relations
with
me
and
he
also
gave
us
counsel
which
rashîd
who
viewed
him
as
our
deadly
foe
at
once
rejected
under
these
rebuffs
the
old
man
became
quite
obsequious
his
son
exclaimed
excitedly
bère
est
heureux
tu
vois
if
feut
bas
quitter
il
feut
rester
afec
toi
comme
chef
de
serfice
chapter
xxviii
a
disappointment
considering
that
i
had
bought
a
house
and
land
exactly
to
my
taste
and
likely
as
rashîd
declared
to
raise
our
honour
in
the
country
i
felt
that
i
had
earned
the
right
to
take
a
holiday
whenever
i
have
done
anything
decisive
it
is
my
instinct
to
withdraw
myself
a
little
from
the
scene
of
action
and
inure
myself
by
contemplation
to
the
new
position
of
affairs
accordingly
having
surveyed
the
house
and
land
as
owner
i
set
off
with
rashîd
upon
a
ten
days
journey
beyond
the
reach
of
telegrams
and
letters
at
the
end
of
the
ten
days
we
rode
into
beyrout
and
put
up
at
a
little
hostelry
which
we
frequented
built
out
on
piers
above
the
sea
there
i
found
two
letters
waiting
for
me
one
from
the
great
druze
chief
who
sold
to
me
my
house
and
land
he
wrote
i
had
to
endure
such
disrespect
and
ignominy
it
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
your
friendship
in
obedience
to
the
consul
order
i
wrote
express
to
the
khawâjah
my
creditor
informing
him
that
there
had
been
some
error
and
entreating
him
to
send
your
cheque
in
to
the
british
consulate
i
hope
to
god
you
have
received
it
safely
before
this
my
health
has
suffered
from
this
huge
indignity
i
shall
not
long
survive
this
cruel
shame
the
second
letter
was
from
her
britannic
majesty
enclosing
my
cheque
written
to
the
order
of
the
armenian
gentleman
for
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
which
he
held
upon
my
druze
property
and
adjuring
me
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
consulate
without
delay
i
went
that
afternoon
the
outer
office
was
crowded
with
the
usual
set
of
english
and
english
persons
who
went
there
for
gossip
my
appearance
called
forth
more
or
less
derisive
shouts
i
was
a
nice
young
man
to
go
and
buy
a
village
from
a
native
too
without
the
forethought
to
secure
a
title
to
the
property
it
was
plain
that
they
knew
more
about
the
matter
than
i
did
myself
i
felt
ashamed
and
must
have
looked
dejected
i
suppose
for
they
changed
their
tone
for
one
more
genial
crying
up
man
we
all
been
through
it
you
know
now
what
these
devils
really
are
they
always
do
you
if
they
can
it
no
shame
to
you
at
your
age
they
so
devilish
clever
i
did
not
know
then
nor
do
i
know
that
i
had
ever
been
defrauded
seriously
or
deceived
by
any
native
of
the
country
but
the
legend
ran
and
doubtless
runs
to
that
effect
then
i
was
called
into
the
consul
presence
and
strongly
blamed
by
him
for
running
off
just
at
the
moment
when
my
presence
was
most
needed
i
had
written
joyously
to
tell
him
of
my
purchase
i
now
heard
that
i
should
have
waited
for
his
reply
before
concluding
it
a
man
does
not
buy
tracts
of
land
like
that
i
was
severely
told
and
as
i
was
so
very
young
and
he
implied
it
idiotic
he
had
intervened
to
stop
the
sale
pending
inquiries
and
the
discharge
of
certain
formalities
which
were
legally
required
if
the
seller
went
into
the
court
and
had
the
transfer
registered
and
a
proper
deed
of
sale
made
out
then
well
and
good
but
he
understood
that
there
was
some
objection
on
the
seller
part
if
not
then
he
advised
me
to
give
up
the
whole
idea
profoundly
conscious
of
my
youth
and
mindful
of
past
kindness
on
the
consul
part
i
was
of
course
impressed
i
thought
i
had
indeed
been
foolish
even
mad
and
promised
to
do
all
that
he
required
of
me
as
i
went
through
the
outer
office
looking
more
than
ever
downcast
i
was
hailed
with
further
adjurations
to
cheer
up
for
they
had
all
been
through
it
rashîd
was
more
depressed
than
even
i
was
when
i
told
him
of
the
sudden
downfall
of
our
hopes
he
cursed
the
consul
and
the
druzes
indiscriminately
but
on
our
journey
up
into
the
mountains
his
reconstructive
mind
transfigured
my
misfortunes
making
of
them
an
event
well
calculated
to
our
honour
so
great
was
my
consideration
in
my
native
country
that
the
queen
herself
had
written
to
the
to
take
care
of
me
and
see
that
i
was
not
defrauded
when
i
bought
my
land
the
consul
who
had
been
neglectful
of
me
and
knew
nothing
of
the
land
i
wished
to
buy
had
been
afraid
of
the
queen
anger
hence
his
mad
activity
i
did
not
hear
that
version
at
the
time
nor
from
rashîd
own
lips
but
it
came
to
my
ears
eventually
after
its
vogue
was
past
we
both
hoped
however
that
the
house
and
land
would
yet
be
ours
i
found
the
druze
chief
prostrate
with
humiliation
and
bewilderment
he
greeted
me
with
monstrous
sighs
and
told
me
how
ashamed
he
was
how
very
his
eyes
reproached
me
what
had
he
ever
done
to
me
that
i
should
loose
upon
him
such
a
swarm
of
ignominies
i
felt
humiliated
and
ashamed
before
him
an
honourable
man
who
had
been
treated
like
a
rogue
on
my
account
shall
not
survive
these
insults
well
i
know
it
i
shall
die
he
kept
lamenting
my
people
know
the
way
i
have
been
treated
like
a
dog
i
told
him
that
there
had
been
a
misunderstanding
and
that
the
shame
which
he
had
suffered
had
been
all
my
fault
because
i
had
been
absent
for
my
selfish
pleasure
at
the
moment
when
i
might
have
saved
him
by
a
simple
statement
of
the
facts
shall
not
easily
recover
the
chief
groaned
then
that
debt
which
i
was
so
delighted
to
pay
off
is
once
again
upon
my
shoulders
i
explained
then
that
the
consul
stopping
of
the
sale
was
not
conclusive
but
provisional
his
only
stipulation
being
that
before
i
paid
all
the
legal
formalities
necessary
to
the
transfer
should
have
been
fulfilled
asks
no
more
than
that
your
excellency
will
condescend
to
go
before
the
caïmmacâm
with
witnesses
and
have
a
proper
made
out
at
those
words
uttered
in
all
innocence
the
great
man
shuddered
violently
and
his
face
went
green
i
feared
that
he
would
have
a
fit
but
he
recovered
gradually
and
at
last
he
said
is
a
cruel
thought
and
one
which
must
have
been
suggested
to
him
by
my
enemies
know
that
the
caïmmacâm
at
present
is
my
rival
and
most
deadly
foe
we
have
not
met
on
terms
of
speech
for
many
years
our
servants
fight
at
chance
encounters
on
the
road
it
is
but
five
years
since
i
held
the
post
of
governor
which
he
now
occupies
when
by
means
of
calumny
and
foul
intrigue
against
me
at
stamboul
he
managed
to
supplant
me
i
swore
a
solemn
oath
that
i
would
never
recognise
the
government
nor
seek
its
sanction
so
long
as
he
remained
its
representative
and
now
the
consul
bids
me
have
recourse
to
him
by
allah
i
would
sooner
be
impaled
alive
he
paused
a
moment
swallowing
his
rage
then
added
however
i
will
do
i
will
summon
all
the
chiefs
of
all
my
people
every
head
of
every
family
hither
to
your
presence
and
command
them
all
to
witness
that
the
property
is
yours
i
will
make
them
swear
to
defend
you
and
your
successors
in
possession
of
it
with
their
lives
if
need
be
and
to
leave
the
obligation
as
a
sacred
charge
to
their
descendants
that
i
think
would
be
sufficient
to
assure
you
undisturbed
possession
if
i
die
as
well
i
may
of
this
treatment
and
if
i
live
till
happier
times
that
is
to
see
the
downfall
of
my
enemy
then
you
shall
have
the
government
certificate
which
the
consul
deems
of
such
immense
importance
i
now
know
that
the
kind
of
treaty
which
he
thus
proposed
laying
a
solemn
charge
on
all
his
people
who
would
have
been
of
course
my
neighbours
to
defend
my
right
would
have
been
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
any
legal
document
in
that
wild
country
the
armenian
gentleman
who
was
delighted
that
his
mortgage
still
held
good
told
me
as
much
when
next
i
saw
him
in
the
city
he
thought
me
foolish
not
to
jump
at
it
particularly
when
the
land
was
offered
to
me
for
a
song
but
the
consul
prohibition
and
the
warnings
of
the
english
colony
possessed
more
weight
with
me
just
then
than
his
opinion
or
indeed
my
own
for
i
was
very
young
i
told
the
chieftain
it
was
not
enough
i
am
truly
sorry
he
replied
with
dignity
there
the
matter
ends
i
have
told
your
honour
the
reason
why
i
can
not
go
to
court
at
present
rashîd
was
sad
when
i
informed
him
of
my
failure
once
more
he
cursed
the
druzes
and
all
consuls
and
as
we
rode
back
through
the
mountains
he
was
wrapped
in
thought
he
came
at
length
to
the
conclusion
that
this
too
redounded
to
our
honour
since
anybody
less
exalted
than
ourselves
would
certainly
have
jumped
at
such
an
offer
as
the
chief
had
made
to
me
but
everything
for
us
must
be
performed
in
the
most
perfect
manner
we
were
tremendous
sticklers
for
formality
there
was
only
one
thing
he
could
not
get
over
is
the
triumph
of
our
enemy
that
sheykh
huseyn
he
told
me
hate
to
think
of
him
in
comfort
in
our
house
chapter
xxix
concerning
crime
and
punishment
if
we
wished
to
stay
in
any
place
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
rashîd
upon
arrival
wandered
through
the
markets
and
inquired
what
dwellings
were
to
let
while
i
sat
down
and
waited
in
some
within
an
hour
he
would
return
with
tidings
of
a
decent
lodging
whither
we
at
once
repaired
with
our
belongings
stabling
our
horses
at
the
nearest
khan
my
servant
was
an
expert
in
the
art
of
borrowing
so
much
so
that
no
sound
of
disputation
on
that
subject
reached
my
ears
it
seemed
as
if
the
neighbours
came
delighted
of
their
own
accord
to
lend
us
pots
and
pans
and
other
necessaries
he
also
did
the
cooking
and
the
marketing
without
a
hitch
giving
a
taste
of
home
to
the
small
whitewashed
chamber
which
we
had
rented
for
a
week
it
might
be
or
a
month
at
most
when
obliged
to
go
out
upon
any
errand
rashîd
was
always
worried
about
leaving
me
alone
regarding
me
as
careless
of
my
property
and
so
untrusty
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
who
idolised
it
your
honour
should
be
seized
with
a
desire
to
smell
the
air
when
i
am
absent
he
would
say
not
forget
to
lock
the
door
and
place
the
key
in
the
appointed
where
i
can
find
it
there
are
wicked
people
in
the
world
and
while
you
sit
alone
keep
our
revolver
handy
he
told
me
that
in
cities
robberies
of
private
dwellings
are
oftener
committed
at
high
noon
when
many
houses
are
left
empty
than
at
night
when
they
are
full
of
snoring
folk
i
did
not
doubt
the
truth
of
this
assertion
but
differed
from
him
in
believing
that
we
harboured
nothing
likely
to
attract
a
thief
would
not
lose
the
buckle
of
a
strap
a
single
grain
of
sesame
by
such
foul
means
he
would
reply
with
vehemence
one
morning
it
was
in
damascus
he
went
out
after
imploring
me
as
usual
to
take
care
of
everything
the
room
we
occupied
was
at
the
end
of
a
blind
alley
up
a
flight
of
nine
stone
steps
the
alley
led
into
a
crowded
narrow
street
bordered
with
shops
of
wares
which
at
that
point
was
partly
shaded
by
a
fine
old
ilex
tree
from
where
i
sprawled
upon
a
bed
of
borrowed
cushions
in
the
room
reading
a
i
had
lately
purchased
rare
things
of
abu
i
saw
the
colour
and
the
movement
of
that
street
as
at
the
far
end
of
a
dark
kaleidoscope
for
all
the
space
between
was
in
deep
shadow
when
a
man
turned
up
our
alley
a
most
rare
occurrence
i
noticed
his
appearance
it
was
rather
strange
he
wore
an
old
blue
shirt
and
on
his
head
a
kind
of
turban
but
of
many
colours
and
unlike
any
i
had
ever
seen
upon
the
natives
of
the
country
with
an
end
or
streamer
hanging
loose
upon
one
side
in
complexion
too
he
was
a
good
deal
darker
than
a
syrian
and
yet
had
nothing
of
the
negro
in
his
looks
something
furtive
in
his
manner
of
approach
amused
me
as
suggestive
of
the
thief
of
rashîd
nightmares
i
moved
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
lay
quite
still
he
climbed
our
steps
and
filled
the
doorway
looking
in
it
happened
that
rashîd
had
left
a
bag
of
lentils
bought
that
morning
just
inside
the
thief
seized
that
and
thinking
he
was
unobserved
was
going
to
look
round
for
other
spoil
when
i
sat
up
and
asked
to
know
his
business
he
gave
one
jump
replied
is
no
matter
and
was
gone
immediately
i
watched
him
running
till
he
vanished
in
the
crowded
street
rashîd
returned
i
told
him
what
had
happened
in
his
absence
but
he
did
not
smile
he
asked
me
gravely
to
describe
the
man
appearance
and
when
i
did
so
groaned
is
a
nûri
gipsy
who
knows
their
had
it
been
a
townsman
or
a
villager
i
might
perhaps
have
caught
him
and
obtained
redress
he
said
this
in
a
manner
of
soliloquy
before
he
turned
to
me
and
with
reproachful
face
exclaimed
stole
our
bag
of
lentils
and
you
watched
him
steal
it
you
had
at
hand
our
good
revolver
yet
you
did
not
shoot
should
i
shoot
a
man
for
such
a
trifle
is
not
the
dimensions
or
the
value
of
the
object
stolen
that
your
honour
ought
to
have
considered
but
the
crime
the
man
who
steals
a
bag
of
lentils
thus
deliberately
is
a
wicked
man
and
when
a
man
is
wicked
he
deserves
to
die
and
he
expects
it
i
told
him
that
the
gipsy
was
quite
welcome
to
the
lentils
but
he
would
not
entertain
that
point
of
view
after
trying
vainly
to
convince
me
of
my
failure
to
perform
a
social
duty
he
went
out
to
the
establishment
of
a
across
the
street
who
kept
his
cups
and
brazier
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
the
old
ilex
tree
and
set
stools
for
his
customers
beneath
its
shade
encroaching
on
the
public
street
thither
i
followed
after
a
few
minutes
and
found
him
telling
everybody
of
the
theft
those
idlers
all
agreed
with
him
that
it
was
right
to
shoot
a
thief
for
a
bag
of
lentils
i
retorted
loftily
knows
i
do
not
grudge
as
much
to
any
man
at
that
there
rose
a
general
cry
of
forbid
while
one
explained
were
a
sin
to
refuse
such
a
thing
to
a
poor
man
in
need
who
came
and
begged
for
it
in
allah
name
but
men
who
take
by
stealth
or
force
are
different
think
if
your
honour
had
destroyed
that
thief
the
rascal
would
not
now
be
robbing
poorer
folk
less
able
to
sustain
the
loss
suppose
that
bag
of
lentils
had
been
all
you
had
there
may
be
people
in
the
world
as
poor
as
that
should
i
kill
a
man
who
offered
me
no
violence
i
asked
defiantly
should
you
not
do
so
when
the
man
is
evidently
wicked
do
the
franks
object
to
killing
wicked
people
asked
the
with
a
laugh
do
they
nourish
good
and
bad
in
their
society
is
because
they
are
without
religion
muttered
one
man
in
his
beard
an
elder
of
superior
rank
who
overheard
agreed
with
him
pronouncing
in
a
tone
of
gentle
pity
is
because
they
lose
belief
in
allah
and
the
life
to
come
they
deem
this
fleeting
life
the
only
one
vouchsafed
to
man
and
death
the
last
and
worst
catastrophe
that
can
befall
him
when
they
have
killed
a
man
they
think
they
have
destroyed
him
quite
and
as
each
one
of
them
fears
such
destruction
for
himself
if
it
became
the
mode
they
condemn
killing
in
their
laws
and
high
assemblies
we
when
we
kill
a
person
know
that
it
is
not
the
end
both
killed
and
killer
will
be
judged
by
one
who
knows
the
secrets
of
men
breasts
the
killed
is
not
deprived
of
every
hope
for
us
death
is
an
incident
for
them
the
end
moreover
they
have
no
idea
of
sacrifice
killing
with
them
is
always
the
result
of
hate
does
your
honour
mean
by
that
last
saying
i
inquired
with
warmth
the
old
man
smiled
on
me
indulgently
as
he
made
answer
sadly
not
offended
if
we
speak
our
mind
before
you
we
should
not
do
so
if
we
wished
you
ill
here
among
us
it
is
not
an
thing
for
men
to
kill
the
creatures
they
love
best
on
earth
nor
do
men
blame
them
when
by
so
doing
they
have
served
the
cause
of
god
which
is
the
welfare
of
mankind
thus
it
was
of
old
the
rule
approved
of
all
the
world
that
every
sultan
of
the
line
of
othman
had
to
kill
his
brothers
lest
they
should
rise
against
him
and
disturb
the
peace
of
all
the
realm
was
it
not
like
depriving
life
of
all
its
sweetness
thus
to
destroy
their
youth
companions
and
their
nearest
kin
yet
though
their
hearts
were
in
the
bodies
of
their
victims
they
achieved
it
and
the
victims
met
their
death
with
the
like
fortitude
all
save
a
few
of
less
heroic
mould
i
have
read
some
histories
written
by
the
europeans
they
do
not
understand
these
things
at
all
they
think
us
merely
cruel
just
as
we
in
the
same
unperceiving
manner
think
them
merely
covetous
yet
i
disagree
with
your
good
servant
in
the
present
case
i
think
that
you
were
right
to
spare
that
nûri
rashîd
who
with
the
rest
of
the
assembly
had
listened
to
the
old
man
speech
with
reverence
exclaimed
is
not
just
this
nûri
or
that
bag
of
lentils
o
my
lord
my
master
is
thus
careless
always
he
never
locks
the
door
when
he
goes
out
during
my
absence
though
all
that
we
possess
is
in
that
room
lord
is
young
the
old
man
smiled
upon
me
kindly
and
proceeded
then
to
read
me
a
mild
lecture
on
my
carelessness
detailing
to
me
the
precautions
which
he
took
himself
habitually
when
shutting
up
his
house
or
place
of
business
including
pious
formulas
which
he
made
me
repeat
after
him
while
he
was
thus
instructing
me
rashîd
went
off
returning
in
about
three
minutes
with
a
face
of
indignation
strangely
and
incongruously
mixed
with
triumph
taking
his
stand
before
me
in
the
very
middle
of
the
seated
crowd
he
said
left
the
door
wide
open
even
after
you
had
seen
that
nûri
steal
the
bag
of
lentils
i
have
this
minute
been
to
look
and
i
have
seen
with
our
revolver
lying
in
the
full
light
of
the
doorway
merciful
allah
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
the
old
man
my
preceptor
laughed
aloud
and
at
the
sound
rashîd
whose
desperation
was
not
acted
wept
real
tears
the
people
round
us
tried
in
vain
to
comfort
him
chapter
xxx
the
unwalled
vineyard
one
morning
as
we
rode
along
we
came
to
vineyards
on
a
rashîd
dismounted
and
began
to
pick
the
grapes
suleymân
dismounted
likewise
and
invited
me
to
do
the
same
it
is
stealing
i
objected
allah
moaned
suleymân
as
one
past
patience
he
hung
his
head
a
moment
limp
all
over
as
if
the
spirit
had
been
taken
out
of
him
then
called
out
to
rashîd
who
was
devouring
grapes
o
malefactor
o
most
wicked
robber
thou
art
guilty
of
a
fearful
crime
thy
master
says
so
rashîd
came
back
to
us
immediately
bringing
a
purple
bunch
which
he
was
going
to
give
to
me
when
suleymân
prevented
him
exclaiming
dishonour
our
good
lord
by
placing
in
his
hands
the
fruit
of
infamy
as
if
he
were
a
vile
accomplice
of
thy
crime
for
shame
o
sinful
depredator
o
defrauder
of
the
poor
rashîd
gaped
at
him
and
then
looked
at
me
i
held
out
my
hand
for
the
grapes
them
not
for
they
are
stolen
cried
suleymân
know
not
what
thou
wouldst
be
at
o
evil
joker
said
rashîd
with
warmth
if
thou
callest
me
a
thief
again
i
break
thy
head
call
thee
thief
thou
art
mistaken
o
my
soul
by
allah
i
am
but
the
mouthpiece
of
thy
master
here
who
says
that
to
pluck
grapes
out
of
this
vineyard
is
to
steal
rashîd
looked
towards
me
half
incredulous
and
seeing
that
i
ate
the
grapes
with
gusto
answered
with
a
laugh
does
not
understand
our
customs
that
is
all
by
allah
there
is
no
man
in
this
land
so
churlish
or
so
covetous
as
to
begrudge
to
thirsty
wayfarers
a
bunch
of
grapes
out
of
his
vineyard
or
figs
or
apricots
from
trees
beside
the
road
to
go
into
the
middle
of
the
vineyard
and
pick
fruit
there
would
be
wrong
but
to
gather
from
the
edge
is
quite
allowable
if
we
were
to
come
with
and
load
them
with
the
grapes
that
would
be
robbery
but
who
but
the
most
miserly
would
blame
us
for
picking
for
our
own
refreshment
as
we
pass
any
more
than
he
would
stop
the
needy
from
gleaning
in
the
fields
when
corn
is
cut
what
your
honour
thinks
a
crime
with
us
is
reckoned
as
a
kindness
done
and
taken
said
suleymân
whose
gift
was
for
interpretations
in
the
same
way
other
matters
which
your
honour
blames
in
us
as
faults
are
in
reality
but
laudable
and
pious
uses
thus
it
is
customary
here
among
us
to
allow
the
servant
to
help
himself
a
little
to
his
plenty
in
so
far
as
food
and
means
of
living
are
concerned
the
servant
being
wholly
given
to
his
master
service
having
no
other
means
of
living
still
must
live
aye
and
support
a
wife
and
children
if
he
have
them
and
it
is
the
custom
of
our
great
ones
to
pay
little
wages
because
they
have
but
little
ready
money
upon
the
other
hand
they
have
possessions
and
wide
influence
in
which
each
servant
is
their
partner
to
a
small
extent
no
one
among
them
would
object
to
such
small
profits
as
that
cook
of
yours
whom
you
condemned
so
fiercely
made
while
in
your
service
if
the
master
does
not
care
to
let
the
servant
gain
beyond
his
wages
he
must
pay
him
wages
high
enough
for
his
existence
certainly
higher
wages
than
you
paid
that
cook
paid
him
what
he
asked
i
said
indignantly
he
asked
what
he
thought
sufficient
in
consideration
of
the
profits
he
felt
sure
of
making
in
your
service
a
foreigner
and
a
young
man
of
many
wants
had
told
him
that
thou
art
of
all
men
living
the
most
generous
put
in
rashîd
my
dismissal
of
that
cook
had
long
been
rankling
in
his
mind
is
the
custom
of
the
country
he
subjoined
defiantly
is
a
custom
which
i
very
heartily
dislike
i
answered
seems
to
me
that
people
here
are
always
grasping
look
at
the
prices
which
the
merchants
ask
the
way
they
bargain
they
fight
for
each
para
as
if
it
were
their
soul
salvation
they
are
mad
for
gain
you
are
mistaken
answered
suleymân
do
not
ask
too
much
from
avarice
but
for
the
sake
of
pastime
indeed
you
will
find
sometimes
that
the
price
they
ask
is
less
than
the
real
value
of
the
object
and
still
they
let
the
buyer
beat
it
down
for
mere
amusement
of
the
argument
and
for
the
sake
of
seeing
what
devices
he
will
use
in
addition
they
will
give
the
buyer
a
nice
cup
of
coffee
sometimes
two
cups
of
coffee
if
the
argument
is
long
and
as
many
glasses
full
of
sherbet
as
he
cares
to
drink
if
the
buyer
will
not
pay
the
price
though
much
reduced
the
merchant
often
will
present
the
object
to
him
as
happened
to
your
honour
in
aleppo
only
the
other
day
put
in
rashîd
was
only
a
device
to
shame
me
into
buying
it
by
your
honour
leave
may
well
be
right
said
suleymân
i
can
not
judge
of
the
peculiar
instance
since
i
was
not
present
just
then
we
came
around
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
saw
some
people
men
and
women
harvesting
the
grapes
in
a
much
larger
vineyard
you
shall
see
exclaimed
rashîd
exultantly
he
got
down
off
his
horse
and
stooped
over
the
nearest
vines
the
workers
seeing
him
set
up
a
shout
of
perform
a
kindness
the
usual
form
of
hospitable
invitation
since
we
refused
to
join
them
in
the
middle
of
the
vineyard
a
man
came
wading
towards
us
bearing
on
his
head
a
basket
tray
piled
up
with
grapes
suleymân
picked
out
three
monstrous
clusters
one
for
each
of
us
with
blessings
on
the
giver
to
my
offer
of
payment
the
fellâh
opposed
a
serious
refusal
saying
would
be
a
shame
for
me
see
now
said
rashîd
as
we
resumed
our
way
is
not
robbery
for
wayfarers
to
take
refreshment
as
for
the
custom
of
the
merchants
added
suleymân
asking
a
much
higher
price
than
that
which
they
at
last
accept
what
would
you
have
those
merchants
are
rich
men
who
have
enough
for
all
their
needs
their
aim
is
not
that
of
the
frankish
traders
to
increase
their
wealth
by
all
means
and
outdistance
rivals
their
object
is
to
pass
the
time
agreeably
and
to
that
end
detain
the
customer
as
long
as
possible
the
more
so
if
he
be
a
person
like
your
honour
who
loves
jokes
and
laughter
the
greatest
disappointment
to
our
merchants
is
for
the
customer
to
pay
the
price
first
asked
and
so
depart
immediately
i
have
a
rare
thing
in
my
memory
which
hits
the
case
has
heard
of
abdu
the
great
egyptian
singer
who
died
recently
his
only
daughter
met
her
death
in
a
distressing
way
it
was
her
wedding
night
and
bride
and
bridegroom
died
of
suffocation
owing
to
the
scent
of
flowers
and
perfumes
in
the
bedroom
where
they
lay
at
sight
of
the
two
corpses
abdu
broke
his
lute
and
swore
a
solemn
oath
never
to
sing
again
was
rich
for
he
had
earned
much
by
his
singing
often
as
much
as
a
hundred
pounds
a
night
and
he
sought
some
means
to
pass
the
time
till
death
should
come
for
him
he
took
a
shop
in
cairo
and
hoped
for
pleasant
conversation
in
the
course
of
bargaining
but
the
egyptians
wished
to
hear
him
sing
again
and
men
of
wealth
among
them
planned
together
to
buy
up
his
whole
immediately
this
happened
thrice
to
the
despair
of
abdu
who
saw
his
hope
of
pastime
taken
from
him
in
the
end
he
was
compelled
to
get
the
câdi
to
release
him
from
his
vow
and
sing
again
although
he
would
have
much
preferred
to
be
a
merchant
that
shows
the
difference
between
a
trader
in
our
cities
and
one
in
any
city
of
the
franks
whose
sole
desire
is
to
sell
quickly
and
repeatedly
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
was
my
reply
my
part
i
detest
this
bargaining
that
is
understood
by
decent
merchants
they
will
not
afflict
thee
they
will
ask
thee
a
fair
price
and
let
thee
go
though
with
regret
for
they
would
rather
spend
an
hour
in
talk
with
thee
said
suleymân
indulgently
is
a
game
of
wits
which
most
men
like
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
honour
was
relating
yesterday
observed
rashîd
with
grievance
in
his
tone
an
englishman
of
your
acquaintance
in
our
country
accused
his
servants
of
dishonesty
doubtless
he
distrusted
them
and
locked
things
up
which
is
the
same
as
saying
to
them
it
is
my
locks
and
my
vigilance
against
your
wits
few
men
of
spirit
could
resist
a
challenge
such
as
that
which
is
indeed
to
urge
men
on
to
robbery
but
where
the
master
trusts
his
servants
and
leaves
all
things
to
their
care
only
a
son
of
infamy
would
dream
of
robbing
him
me
propound
the
matter
otherwise
for
understanding
seeing
that
open
vineyard
with
a
wall
but
two
stones
high
no
man
would
think
of
plundering
the
crop
of
grapes
but
surround
that
vineyard
with
a
high
strong
wall
and
every
son
of
adam
will
conceive
the
project
of
clearing
it
of
every
cluster
should
never
think
of
such
a
thing
is
because
your
honour
is
accustomed
to
restraints
and
barriers
said
suleymân
in
the
sultan
dominions
have
more
freedom
praise
to
allah
for
us
a
high
wall
is
an
insult
save
in
cities
chapter
xxxi
the
atheist
though
i
had
known
suleymân
for
nearly
two
years
and
had
had
him
with
me
for
some
six
months
of
that
time
i
had
never
seen
him
in
his
function
of
a
dragoman
by
which
he
earned
enough
in
two
months
of
the
year
to
keep
a
wife
and
children
in
a
village
of
the
coasts
of
tyre
and
sidon
of
which
he
spoke
with
affection
though
he
seldom
went
there
it
was
only
after
much
insistence
that
he
allowed
us
to
conduct
him
thither
on
one
memorable
occasion
when
i
could
not
but
admire
his
perfect
manners
as
a
despot
when
first
i
met
him
he
had
been
a
gentleman
at
large
and
it
was
as
that
and
a
familiar
friend
that
he
repaired
to
me
whenever
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
judging
from
his
gifts
of
conversation
which
we
all
admired
and
his
unbounded
knowledge
of
the
country
i
thought
that
as
a
guide
for
tourists
he
would
be
invaluable
so
when
i
heard
that
english
friends
of
mine
were
coming
out
to
palestine
i
wrote
advising
them
to
ask
for
him
him
only
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
soon
afterwards
that
he
was
with
them
when
they
came
north
i
joined
the
party
at
damascus
and
travelled
with
them
for
their
last
fortnight
it
did
not
take
me
many
minutes
in
the
camp
to
see
that
suleymân
was
not
himself
and
that
my
friends
were
not
so
charmed
with
him
as
i
had
thought
they
would
be
on
the
first
evening
in
their
tent
i
heard
complaints
they
told
me
he
was
most
unconscionably
lazy
and
would
not
take
them
to
the
places
they
desired
to
visit
the
trouble
was
as
i
soon
learnt
that
they
possessed
a
map
and
guidebook
which
they
studied
reverently
every
night
finding
out
places
said
therein
to
be
of
interest
suleymân
on
his
side
had
at
setting
out
possessed
a
plan
to
make
their
tour
the
most
delightful
one
imaginable
he
hoped
by
visiting
selected
spots
and
people
to
give
it
sequence
and
significance
in
a
word
he
was
an
artist
in
travel
wishing
to
provide
them
with
delicious
memories
while
they
were
english
and
omnivorous
of
facts
and
scenes
when
he
learnt
from
various
rebuffs
that
they
would
not
confide
themselves
to
him
he
lost
all
pleasure
in
the
tour
it
was
a
listless
and
disgusted
upper
servant
most
unlike
the
man
i
knew
whom
i
found
in
gorgeous
raiment
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
gardens
of
damascus
which
were
then
a
wilderness
of
roses
he
did
not
explain
matters
to
me
all
at
once
when
i
reproached
him
for
neglecting
friends
of
mine
he
answered
only
is
the
will
of
allah
who
made
men
of
different
kinds
some
sweet
some
loathsome
but
my
arrival
mended
things
a
little
at
least
my
english
friends
professed
to
see
a
great
improvement
in
the
conduct
of
suleymân
and
all
the
servants
i
think
it
was
because
the
poor
souls
knew
that
they
had
someone
now
to
whom
they
could
express
their
grievances
someone
who
would
condescend
to
talk
with
them
for
nothing
is
more
foreign
to
the
oriental
scheme
of
life
than
the
distance
at
which
english
people
keep
their
servants
in
the
democratic
east
all
men
are
equal
as
far
as
rights
of
conversation
are
concerned
it
is
a
hardship
for
the
oriental
to
serve
europeans
and
only
the
much
higher
and
more
certain
wages
bring
him
to
it
my
english
friends
had
few
good
words
to
say
for
any
of
their
arab
servants
but
i
found
they
had
conceived
a
perfect
hatred
for
the
cook
who
had
undoubtedly
a
villainous
appearance
he
was
a
man
with
a
strong
cast
in
his
surviving
eye
a
which
had
once
been
white
concealed
his
shaven
poll
and
his
long
pointed
ears
stood
out
upon
it
he
wore
a
shirt
of
indigo
impaired
by
time
over
which
when
riding
he
would
throw
an
ancient
frankish
coat
or
if
it
chanced
to
rain
a
piece
of
sacking
his
legs
were
bare
and
he
wore
scarlet
slippers
to
see
him
riding
on
an
ass
hung
round
with
cooking
tins
at
the
head
of
the
procession
of
the
beasts
of
burden
suggested
to
the
uninformed
spectator
that
those
beasts
of
burden
and
their
loads
had
all
been
stolen
i
spoke
about
him
to
suleymân
one
day
when
in
my
company
he
had
regained
his
wonted
spirits
telling
him
of
the
extreme
dislike
my
friends
had
taken
to
the
man
are
foolish
he
replied
grumble
at
the
figure
of
a
mill
which
grinds
good
flour
they
profit
by
his
cooking
which
is
excellent
indeed
he
is
the
best
cook
in
the
world
and
most
particular
i
took
great
trouble
to
secure
him
for
this
expedition
knowing
that
the
khawâjât
were
friends
of
yours
the
tone
of
grievance
in
his
voice
became
acute
i
feared
that
he
was
going
to
cry
so
answered
quickly
is
not
that
they
like
his
cooking
but
his
manners
know
they
of
his
manners
has
he
ever
entered
the
saloon
or
to
defile
them
has
he
ever
spoken
insult
in
their
hearing
inform
me
of
his
crime
and
i
will
beat
him
bloody
but
well
i
know
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
for
i
have
kept
him
in
the
strictest
order
all
these
days
it
is
only
his
appearance
they
object
to
and
that
is
god
affair
not
theirs
the
lord
repay
them
say
that
you
have
kept
him
in
strict
order
is
that
necessary
course
it
is
for
the
poor
man
is
mad
i
thought
his
madness
would
amuse
them
it
is
very
funny
but
allah
knows
that
there
is
not
a
laugh
in
all
their
bodies
so
i
have
kept
him
from
approaching
them
the
word
which
i
have
here
translated
has
often
as
i
knew
a
complimentary
value
and
i
gathered
from
suleymân
way
of
speaking
that
the
cook
was
not
a
raving
maniac
but
rather
what
in
english
we
should
call
character
i
cultivated
his
acquaintance
after
that
and
was
astonished
by
his
powers
of
and
of
mimicry
still
more
perhaps
by
a
curious
dry
scepticism
expressed
facetiously
and
sometimes
with
profanity
which
was
evident
in
almost
everything
he
said
this
it
was
which
chiefly
pleased
the
waiter
and
the
muleteers
who
were
his
usual
listeners
since
they
were
together
on
the
road
they
would
laugh
and
curse
him
in
religious
terms
for
a
blasphemer
and
a
wicked
atheist
reproofs
which
he
received
as
high
applause
it
was
his
custom
to
salute
his
friends
with
insults
which
they
took
kindly
from
him
being
what
he
was
they
told
me
in
low
tones
of
awe
yet
with
a
chuckle
that
he
had
even
sold
his
father
grave
in
a
facetious
way
but
i
could
never
get
them
to
relate
that
story
clearly
i
could
understand
then
why
suleymân
had
kept
him
in
strict
order
on
the
journey
for
my
english
friends
were
quite
incapable
of
seeing
any
fun
in
such
a
character
nor
did
i
ever
tell
them
of
the
great
adventure
of
that
journey
in
which
their
cook
was
very
nearly
done
to
death
it
happened
near
the
village
of
mejdel
down
in
the
valley
underneath
mount
hermon
we
remained
in
camp
there
over
sunday
and
on
sunday
afternoon
my
friends
were
resting
in
their
tent
suleymân
and
i
had
seized
that
opportunity
to
go
off
for
a
ramble
by
ourselves
which
did
us
good
we
were
returning
to
the
camp
in
time
for
tea
when
a
crowd
of
fellâhîn
came
hurrying
from
the
direction
of
our
tents
waving
their
arms
and
shouting
seeming
very
angry
suleymân
called
out
to
them
to
learn
the
matter
an
atheist
they
cried
zandîq
i
asked
eagerly
in
yonder
tent
an
old
man
informed
me
with
wide
eyes
of
horror
he
pointed
to
the
canvas
windscreen
against
which
our
famous
cook
sat
gazing
at
the
kettle
he
had
set
to
boil
for
tea
go
to
fetch
the
wherewithal
to
kill
him
properly
said
suleymân
peremptorily
are
mistaken
that
is
our
cook
a
good
religious
man
but
mad
occasionally
there
is
no
mistake
o
lords
of
honour
cried
a
score
of
voices
while
the
old
man
who
had
pointed
out
the
cook
to
me
explained
said
may
god
protect
us
from
the
blame
of
it
he
said
you
see
that
mountain
it
is
i
who
made
it
prostrate
yourselves
before
me
for
i
made
the
world
we
had
been
standing
round
him
inoffensively
asking
him
questions
as
the
custom
is
about
his
parentage
his
trade
and
so
forth
but
when
we
heard
that
awful
blasphemy
we
rent
our
clothes
and
ran
in
haste
to
fetch
our
weapons
as
thou
seest
delay
us
not
for
he
must
surely
die
not
such
a
wickedness
the
man
is
mad
he
is
sane
mad
i
do
assure
you
return
with
us
and
i
will
prove
it
to
your
understanding
cried
suleymân
i
added
my
assurance
they
came
back
with
us
but
murmuring
and
in
two
minds
i
could
not
but
admire
the
simple
piety
which
prompted
them
at
once
to
kill
a
man
whose
speech
betrayed
him
as
an
atheist
but
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
what
might
happen
and
of
the
sad
impression
it
would
make
upon
my
english
friends
and
everything
depended
on
the
cook
behaviour
tell
you
he
is
mad
said
suleymân
advancing
towards
the
fire
were
a
sin
for
you
to
slay
a
thus
afflicted
come
hither
o
mansûr
he
cried
as
to
a
dog
the
cook
rose
up
and
came
towards
us
with
a
foolish
air
down
before
my
horse
i
would
ride
over
thee
the
cook
fell
prostrate
then
turned
over
on
his
back
his
mouth
hung
open
idiotically
his
tongue
lolled
out
rise
and
kiss
my
boot
the
cook
obeyed
by
that
time
there
were
murmurs
of
compassion
from
the
slayers
i
not
truly
asked
suleymân
o
sun
of
verity
he
is
quite
mad
the
poor
one
said
the
old
man
who
had
acted
spokesman
were
a
sin
for
us
to
kill
him
being
in
that
state
his
manner
at
the
first
deceived
us
allah
heal
him
how
came
the
dreadful
malady
upon
him
came
upon
him
through
the
pangs
of
unrequited
love
the
poor
one
ah
the
misery
of
men
may
allah
heal
him
cried
the
women
as
the
group
of
villagers
moved
off
contented
just
when
the
last
of
them
passed
out
of
sight
the
longest
tongue
i
ever
saw
in
man
emerged
from
the
cook
mouth
and
the
rascal
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
in
a
derisive
gesture
those
portents
were
succeeded
by
a
realistic
makes
the
cook
like
that
devoid
of
reverence
i
asked
of
suleymân
is
because
he
was
born
in
jerusalem
was
the
astonishing
reply

chapter
xxxii
the
selling
of
our
gun
i
had
been
ill
with
typhoid
fever
just
before
my
illness
the
son
of
a
sheykh
in
our
neighbourhood
had
asked
me
to
lend
him
my
gun
for
a
few
days
since
i
never
used
it
there
was
nothing
really
which
i
cared
to
shoot
the
village
people
rushed
out
in
pursuit
of
every
little
bird
whose
tweet
was
heard
however
distant
in
the
olive
groves
or
up
the
mountain
side
jackals
there
were
besides
and
an
occasional
hyæna
and
in
the
higher
mountains
tigers
so
the
people
still
persisted
in
declaring
meaning
leopards
i
suppose
or
lynxes
for
ignorant
arabs
lump
together
a
whole
genus
under
one
specific
name
in
the
same
way
that
they
call
all
wild
plants
which
have
neither
scent
nor
grass
it
was
after
we
had
sought
those
tigers
vainly
that
i
put
away
my
gun
the
sheykh
son
asked
me
for
the
loan
of
it
and
i
consented
in
the
absence
of
rashîd
who
when
he
heard
what
i
had
done
defiled
his
face
with
dust
and
wailed
aloud
suleymân
who
happened
to
be
with
us
at
the
moment
also
blamed
me
looking
as
black
as
if
i
had
committed
some
sin
it
is
unlucky
for
a
man
to
lend
his
gun
to
anybody
even
to
the
greatest
friend
he
has
on
earth
they
told
me
sadly
and
that
for
no
superstitious
reason
but
because
according
to
the
law
if
murder
be
committed
with
that
weapon
the
owner
of
the
gun
will
be
considered
guilty
no
matter
by
whose
hand
the
shot
was
fired
do
they
know
the
owner
of
the
gun
i
answered
scoffing
every
gun
there
is
a
tezkereh
answered
rashîd
he
who
holds
the
tezkereh
is
held
responsible
for
every
use
to
which
that
gun
is
put
it
was
in
fact
a
way
of
saying
that
the
gun
licence
was
not
transferable
i
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
i
had
no
tezkereh
but
that
did
not
appear
to
reassure
them
in
the
least
they
still
were
of
opinion
harm
might
come
of
it
then
i
fell
ill
and
knew
no
more
of
daily
life
until
i
found
myself
in
a
hospital
of
the
german
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
where
the
good
sisters
nursed
me
back
to
health
among
the
arab
visitors
from
far
and
near
who
came
to
see
me
as
i
lay
in
bed
was
the
youth
who
had
borrowed
my
gun
together
with
his
father
and
his
brethren
who
wept
real
tears
and
prayed
for
my
complete
recovery
talking
as
if
they
were
beholden
to
me
in
some
signal
way
their
manner
puzzled
me
a
little
at
the
time
but
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
perplexity
when
discharged
at
last
from
hospital
i
travelled
back
into
the
mountains
with
rashîd
on
the
very
day
of
my
return
i
got
an
invitation
from
that
young
father
to
dine
with
him
at
noon
upon
the
morrow
rashîd
made
a
grimace
at
hearing
of
it
and
when
i
asked
him
why
looked
down
his
nose
and
said
has
our
gun
to
be
sure
and
so
he
has
i
said
i
must
not
forget
to
ask
him
for
it
rashîd
looked
big
with
tidings
but
restrained
himself
and
merely
growled
will
not
ask
for
it
i
know
your
honour
nor
will
that
rogue
return
it
of
his
own
accord
at
the
sheykh
house
next
day
i
found
a
largeish
company
assembled
in
my
honour
as
it
seemed
innumerable
were
the
compliments
on
my
recovery
the
pretty
speeches
and
remarks
to
which
i
made
reply
as
best
i
could
the
meal
consisted
of
some
thirty
courses
and
was
set
on
trays
upon
the
floor
in
the
old
country
fashion
everybody
eating
with
his
fingers
from
the
dish
when
it
drew
near
an
end
the
son
of
the
house
glanced
at
his
father
meaningly
and
getting
in
return
a
nod
rose
up
and
left
the
room
he
soon
came
back
carrying
my
gun
which
he
brought
first
to
me
as
if
for
benediction
then
handed
round
for
the
inspection
of
the
other
guests
there
were
cries
of
while
they
all
praised
its
workmanship
one
man
opining
that
it
must
have
cost
a
mint
of
money
another
wishing
he
possessed
its
brother
and
so
forth
these
exclamations
and
asides
were
evidently
aimed
at
me
and
it
was
somehow
carried
to
my
understanding
that
this
exhibition
of
the
gun
and
not
the
public
joy
on
my
recovery
was
the
true
reason
of
the
feast
and
all
attending
it
though
why
it
should
be
so
i
could
not
think
thing
that
is
remarkable
about
this
gun
explained
the
master
of
the
house
that
it
can
not
miss
the
object
aimed
at
we
have
tried
it
at
a
target
nailed
upon
a
tree
i
and
my
sons
at
fifty
and
a
hundred
paces
aye
and
more
and
by
the
lord
the
bullet
always
strikes
exactly
on
the
spot
at
which
the
gun
is
pointed
even
though
that
spot
be
not
much
bigger
than
a
gnat
and
then
quite
unaccountably
the
whole
assembly
rose
and
tried
to
kiss
my
hands
as
if
the
virtues
of
my
gun
were
due
to
me
it
was
obviously
not
the
moment
to
reclaim
the
weapon
when
i
got
home
after
that
strange
ovation
rashîd
received
me
coldly
and
observed
do
not
bring
our
gun
you
feared
to
ask
for
it
did
not
i
know
how
it
would
be
oh
allah
allah
had
no
opportunity
i
told
him
i
am
going
now
to
write
and
ask
him
to
return
it
be
ready
for
the
letter
you
will
have
to
take
it
my
head
and
eye
with
all
alacrity
rashîd
replied
did
i
rejoice
so
much
in
any
errand
that
rascal
has
been
telling
everybody
that
it
is
your
gift
to
him
and
boasting
of
his
gun
through
all
the
mountains
no
doubt
he
counts
upon
your
illness
having
dimmed
remembrance
and
hopes
that
you
yourself
may
be
deluded
into
thinking
that
it
was
a
gift
and
not
a
loan
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
i
asked
it
my
business
till
the
question
rose
i
wrote
a
civil
note
to
the
young
man
asking
him
to
let
me
have
the
gun
in
a
few
days
as
i
was
collecting
my
belongings
for
the
journey
back
to
england
i
thanked
him
for
the
care
which
he
had
taken
of
my
property
which
was
much
better
kept
than
when
i
lent
it
to
him
as
i
had
remarked
that
day
rashîd
received
the
missive
and
went
off
exulting
within
an
hour
that
young
man
came
to
me
without
the
gun
and
in
a
state
of
most
profound
affliction
and
despair
having
shut
the
door
with
great
precaution
to
make
sure
we
were
alone
he
fell
upon
the
ground
and
burst
out
crying
confessing
that
his
passion
for
the
gun
had
made
him
dream
that
it
was
his
each
night
as
he
lay
thinking
ere
he
fell
asleep
i
did
not
tell
a
soul
that
it
was
mine
did
but
dream
it
until
i
knew
your
honour
was
abed
and
like
to
die
he
told
me
naively
as
something
which
might
make
his
fault
seem
natural
thought
that
you
would
die
and
leave
it
with
me
so
thinking
me
as
good
as
dead
he
had
told
his
father
and
his
brothers
that
it
was
a
gift
from
me
or
as
it
were
a
legacy
and
now
the
fame
of
my
munificence
my
love
for
him
had
gone
abroad
an
hour
ago
when
he
received
my
letter
he
had
confessed
the
truth
at
last
and
privately
to
his
beloved
father
who
while
strongly
blaming
him
for
his
deceit
was
willing
to
pay
any
price
i
chose
to
put
upon
the
weapon
to
save
him
from
the
horrid
scandal
of
exposure
if
the
story
became
public
in
the
country
he
would
die
of
grief
the
honour
of
a
noble
house
was
at
my
mercy
the
gun
so
much
admired
was
quite
a
cheap
one
in
reality
i
had
bought
it
for
ten
pounds
three
years
before
in
london
on
the
advice
of
an
uncle
skilled
in
all
such
matters
after
a
moment
thought
i
said
english
pounds
never
in
my
life
before
or
since
have
i
beheld
such
transports
of
relief
and
gratitude
nor
heard
such
heartfelt
praises
of
my
generosity
he
told
the
money
out
before
me
there
and
then
insisted
on
embracing
me
repeatedly
and
then
rushed
out
intent
to
tell
his
father
when
he
had
gone
rashîd
appeared
before
me
stern
and
aloof
as
the
recording
angel
is
a
crime
you
have
committed
he
exclaimed
indignantly
rascal
told
me
as
we
came
along
together
that
his
father
was
prepared
to
pay
a
hundred
pounds
to
save
their
honour
he
had
sinned
it
is
but
right
his
house
should
bear
the
punishment
would
have
done
as
i
have
done
in
my
position
i
assured
him
laughing
the
position
of
your
honour
was
the
dignified
reply
should
either
have
made
him
pay
a
hundred
pounds
for
our
gun
or
else
persuaded
him
that
it
was
worth
a
hundred
pounds
and
then
presented
it
in
either
case
i
should
have
crushed
those
people
utterly
but
for
a
man
in
your
position
to
accept
eight
pounds
for
such
a
weapon
and
proclaim
it
worth
no
more
that
is
a
shame
if
your
desire
was
money
you
should
not
have
touched
the
matter
personally
but
have
left
it
altogether
in
the
hands
of
me
your
servant
who
am
always
careful
of
your
honour
which
is
mine
as
well
he
sulked
with
me
thereafter
for
two
days
footnotes
licence
chapter
xxxiii
my
benefactor
when
i
knew
at
length
that
i
was
going
to
leave
syria
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
buy
all
kinds
of
notions
of
the
country
to
show
to
my
people
at
home
a
very
foolish
way
of
spending
money
i
am
now
aware
for
such
things
lose
significance
when
taken
from
their
proper
setting
in
after
days
when
leaving
syria
for
england
the
one
thing
i
would
purchase
for
myself
was
a
supply
of
reed
pens
for
arabic
writing
but
on
that
first
occasion
i
wished
to
carry
the
whole
country
with
me
there
was
an
old
learned
christian
of
beyrout
who
had
given
me
lessons
in
arabic
at
various
times
and
always
waited
on
me
honourably
whenever
i
alighted
in
that
loveliest
and
most
detestable
of
seaport
towns
he
wore
the
baggiest
of
baggy
trousers
looking
just
like
petticoats
a
short
fez
with
enormous
hanging
tassel
a
black
alpaca
coat
of
french
design
a
crimson
vest
white
cotton
stockings
and
boots
convenient
to
pull
off
ere
entering
a
room
he
always
carried
in
the
street
a
cane
which
he
would
lean
with
care
against
the
wall
of
any
room
he
chanced
to
enter
never
laying
it
upon
the
ground
or
on
a
chair
or
table
in
all
the
time
of
my
acquaintance
with
him
i
never
that
i
can
remember
saw
him
really
smile
though
something
like
a
twinkle
would
occasionally
touch
his
eyes
beneath
great
bushy
eyebrows
between
black
and
grey
an
extraordinarily
strong
and
heavy
grey
moustache
with
drooping
ends
gave
him
a
likeness
to
some
aged
walrus
so
that
some
of
the
common
people
actually
called
him
el
the
old
man
of
the
sea
which
is
the
proper
arabic
designation
of
a
walrus
he
came
to
see
me
after
i
had
left
the
hospital
and
was
staying
with
some
english
friends
for
a
few
days
before
returning
to
the
wilds
for
a
farewell
and
repeatedly
praised
allah
for
my
safe
recovery
there
never
was
a
man
more
thoroughly
respectable
more
perfectly
correct
in
every
word
and
movement
he
disapproved
of
poor
rashîd
as
a
companion
for
me
because
the
latter
dealt
in
vulgar
language
and
i
feel
certain
that
he
would
have
disapproved
of
suleymân
if
he
had
ever
seen
that
sun
of
wisdom
in
my
company
for
pandering
to
my
desire
for
foolish
stories
he
was
known
as
the
costantîn
a
worthy
man
with
his
usual
ceremonious
salutation
suggestive
of
his
high
position
as
a
representative
of
learning
he
placed
himself
at
my
command
for
any
purchases
i
wished
to
make
knowing
he
said
that
i
was
likely
to
be
busy
in
the
weeks
before
departure
and
his
offer
was
extremely
welcome
to
me
at
the
time
i
wished
as
i
have
said
already
to
buy
lots
of
things
among
others
why
i
can
not
now
imagine
the
whole
costume
of
natives
of
the
country
the
costantîn
praised
my
intention
gravely
declaring
that
it
could
not
fail
to
interest
my
honoured
relatives
and
lovers
and
enlarge
their
minds
to
know
the
details
of
a
dress
the
most
becoming
in
the
world
in
order
that
a
full
idea
of
syrian
raiment
might
be
given
two
suits
and
two
long
garments
corresponding
to
two
other
suits
were
necessary
he
pronounced
these
with
the
various
articles
of
clothing
which
i
then
possessed
and
had
grown
used
to
wearing
in
the
country
would
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
exhibition
upon
the
following
day
as
i
was
dressing
about
ten
for
i
was
still
to
some
extent
an
invalid
there
came
a
light
knock
at
the
door
and
the
costantîn
appeared
ushering
in
a
friend
of
his
who
was
a
tailor
a
man
as
grave
and
worthy
as
himself
who
there
and
then
proceeded
to
take
measurements
praising
the
proportions
with
which
nature
had
endowed
me
and
asking
allah
to
fill
out
those
parts
which
now
were
lean
through
illness
the
moment
of
a
man
uprising
is
or
was
at
that
time
for
old
customs
are
now
dying
out
the
one
which
servants
tradesmen
pedlars
and
all
who
wished
to
ask
a
favour
chose
for
visiting
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
in
an
eastern
city
where
i
happened
to
be
known
i
have
had
as
many
as
twelve
persons
squatting
round
upon
the
floor
watching
a
barber
shave
me
while
a
little
boy
the
barber
bearing
towels
jug
and
basin
waited
upon
him
like
an
acolyte
the
tailor
having
made
the
necessary
notes
withdrew
with
many
compliments
the
costantîn
remained
behind
a
moment
to
assure
me
in
a
loud
that
the
said
tailor
was
a
man
whom
i
could
trust
to
do
the
best
for
me
and
that
i
might
think
myself
extremely
fortunate
to
have
secured
his
services
as
being
much
sought
after
by
the
fashionables
he
generally
had
more
work
than
he
could
really
do
but
that
having
taken
as
he
said
a
fancy
to
me
he
would
certainly
turn
out
a
set
of
garments
to
enslave
the
heart
having
said
this
in
the
finest
classic
phraseology
he
went
out
to
rejoin
the
tailor
in
the
passage
nor
did
i
see
him
any
more
until
the
very
day
of
my
departure
when
at
the
english
hospitable
house
i
was
waiting
for
the
carriage
which
would
take
me
to
the
quay
i
was
told
that
someone
wished
to
see
me
upon
urgent
business
and
going
to
the
great
liwân
or
i
found
my
friend
his
cane
leaned
carefully
against
the
wall
as
usual
he
carried
underneath
his
arm
a
number
of
large
books
these
he
presented
to
me
with
a
solemn
bow
occurred
to
me
he
said
as
your
honour
has
a
predilection
for
all
those
curious
and
often
foolish
tales
which
circulate
among
the
common
people
you
might
not
perhaps
disdain
these
four
poor
volumes
which
i
chance
to
have
in
my
possession
deign
to
accept
them
as
a
parting
gift
from
me
i
thanked
him
kindly
though
in
truth
i
was
embarrassed
not
knowing
where
to
stow
the
books
since
all
my
things
were
packed
and
then
he
handed
me
the
tailor
bill
which
with
the
clothes
which
i
had
ordered
had
escaped
my
memory
are
the
clothes
i
asked
had
forgotten
them
he
pointed
to
a
bundle
pinned
up
honourably
in
a
silken
wrapper
reposing
on
the
floor
hard
by
the
cane
i
tore
the
envelope
and
opened
out
the
bill
it
came
to
twenty
pounds
and
i
had
got
my
money
ready
for
my
journey
i
was
going
to
visit
some
of
the
greek
islands
smyrna
and
constantinople
on
my
way
to
england
and
had
hoped
besides
to
see
a
little
of
the
balkan
states
to
pay
out
twenty
pounds
was
to
reduce
that
journey
by
at
least
a
fortnight
and
as
i
said
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
clothes
regarding
all
my
syrian
debts
as
fully
paid
the
hall
was
empty
we
were
quite
alone
i
fear
i
stormed
at
the
costantîn
reminding
him
that
he
had
promised
that
the
clothes
should
not
be
dear
he
persisted
are
very
cheap
for
the
materials
if
your
honour
wish
was
to
pay
less
you
ought
not
to
have
chosen
fabrics
three
parts
silk
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
counting
money
he
was
right
throughout
my
stay
in
syria
until
that
moment
i
had
never
counted
money
compared
with
england
living
in
the
country
was
absurdly
cheap
and
on
my
small
allowance
i
had
lived
at
ease
he
might
quite
reasonably
have
supposed
me
to
be
very
wealthy
but
i
was
not
in
reasonable
mood
just
then
i
paid
the
bill
but
in
an
angry
manner
and
while
i
was
still
talking
to
him
the
cawwâs
arrived
and
close
upon
his
heels
rashîd
in
tears
to
tell
me
that
the
carriage
was
in
waiting
the
grief
i
felt
at
leaving
syria
at
parting
from
rashîd
and
our
sheytân
and
many
friends
took
hold
of
me
hurriedly
i
said
goodbye
to
the
costantîn
and
i
am
glad
to
say
i
changed
my
tone
at
that
last
moment
and
had
the
grace
to
bid
him
think
no
more
of
the
whole
matter
but
i
shall
carry
to
my
grave
the
recollection
of
his
face
of
horror
while
i
scolded
the
look
that
told
his
grief
that
he
had
been
deceived
in
me
i
went
and
shoved
the
books
into
my
luggage
here
and
there
gave
rashîd
orders
to
send
on
the
clothes
took
leave
of
my
kind
hosts
and
drove
down
in
a
hurry
to
the
quay
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
i
arrived
in
england
that
i
realised
that
the
volumes
which
he
had
presented
to
me
were
a
complete
bûlâc
edition
of
the
and
one
a
valuable
book
which
is
my
greatest
treasure
nor
have
i
ever
had
the
chance
of
thanking
the
giver
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
gift
and
wiping
out
the
bad
impression
left
by
my
for
a
letter
which
i
wrote
from
england
never
reached
him
i
am
told
and
when
i
next
was
in
his
country
the
costantîn
had
gone
where
kindness
patience
courtesy
and
all
his
other
virtues
are
i
hope
rewarded
