a

inquired

job
does

hold
down
you
an
awful
ignorant
young
man
bob
replied
the
wounded
bad
man
reproachfully
a
godfather
is
a
sort
of
reserve
parent
who
promises
to
renounce
the
devil
with
all
his
works
an
youngest
bad

the
three
godfathers
the
daylight
raid
on
the
wickenburg
national
bank
had
not
been
a
success
it
had
been
well
planned
boldly
and
cleverly
executed
and
the
four
bandits
had
gathered
unto
themselves
quite
a
fortune
in
paper
money
the
job
had
been
singularly
free
from
fuss
and
feathers
nevertheless
as
has
already
been
stated
the
raid
was
not
a
success
the
assistant
cashier
returning
from
luncheon
had
from
a
distance
of
half
a
block
observed
two
strangers
in
town
both
strangers
were
mounted
and
stood
on
guard
in
front
of
the
wickenburg
national
in
an
alley
just
back
of
the
bank
two
saddle
horses
were
standing
and
as
the
assistant
cashier
paused
irresolute
two
men
came
out
of
the
bank
mounted
the
two
horses
waiting
in
the
alley
and
followed
by
the
men
who
had
been
standing
on
watch
in
front
of
the
bank
rode
out
of
wickenburg
in
rather
a
suspicious
hurry
the
assistant
cashier
had
an
inspiration
thieves
robbers
stop
he
yelled
his
hue
and
cry
aroused
to
action
an
apparently
inoffensive
and
elderly
citizen
who
was
taking
his
siesta
in
front
of
the
three
deuces
saloon
now
this
man
in
front
of
the
three
deuces
was
not
the
sheriff
he
was
not
even
the
city
marshal
rather
he
inclined
one
to
the
belief
that
he
might
be
a
minister
of
the
gospel
a
on
guard
at
the
portals
of
the
three
deuces
within
which
judging
by
the
subdued
rattle
of
poker
chips
ivory
balls
and
an
occasional
hoarse
shout
of
keno
one
could
be
reasonably
certain
of
a
plethora
of
brands
ripe
for
the
burning
the
aged
citizen
asleep
in
the
chair
outside
was
arrayed
in
somber
black
with
a
collar
and
white
lawn
tie
a
biled
shirt
with
a
ruby
stud
in
it
and
patriarchial
white
whiskers
but
his
coat
of
a
clerical
cut
effectually
concealed
two
pieces
of
artillery
of
a
style
and
caliber
popularized
by
time
and
tradition
in
the
fair
state
of
arizona
the
four
galloping
horsemen
were
abreast
the
three
deuces
when
the
cry
of
robbers
aroused
all
wickenburg
it
awoke
the
man
in
the
chair
and
he
came
to
his
feet
with
the
suddenness
of
a
ferocious
old
dog
filled
both
hands
and
cut
loose
at
one
of
the
four
horsemen
there
was
a
reason
for
this
the
elderly
citizen
had
a
deposit
of
three
dollars
and
seventeen
cents
in
the
wickenburg
national
also
he
possessed
a
fair
proportion
of
civic
pride
and
the
horseman
upon
whom
he
trained
his
hardware
was
carrying
a
containing
a
pro
rata
of
the
said
elderly
citizen
four
bad
men
had
ridden
into
wickenburg
that
december
afternoon
but
only
three
rode
out
one
of
the
three
had
a
bullet
hole
through
his
left
shoulder
the
man
who
stayed
lay
thoroughly
and
effectually
defunct
on
top
of
a
bulging
in
front
of
the
three
deuces
came
presently
the
paying
teller
of
the
wickenburg
national
and
removed
the
came
half
an
hour
later
the
coroner
of
wickenburg
and
removed
the
body
as
for
the
elderly
citizen
of
deceptive
appearance
he
walked
uptown
to
a
hardware
store
replenished
his
supply
of
ammunition
and
returned
to
the
three
deuces
in
a
highly
cheerful
frame
of
mind
here
let
us
leave
him
for
with
this
story
he
has
nothing
further
to
do
from
now
on
our
interest
must
center
on
the
three
bad
men
who
rode
out
of
wickenburg
headed
for
the
california
line
which
happens
to
be
the
colorado
river
they
made
their
first
halt
at
granite
tanks
miles
from
wickenburg
here
they
watered
their
horses
and
then
pressed
onward
toward
the
river
at
the
river
they
found
a
boat
thoughtfully
provided
for
just
such
an
emergency
as
the
present
darkness
had
already
settled
over
the
land
when
the
three
bad
men
came
to
the
colorado
river
it
would
have
been
wise
on
their
part
to
have
waited
until
the
rising
of
the
moon
but
our
story
does
not
deal
with
the
three
wise
men
within
the
hour
a
posse
might
appear
and
moreover
the
three
bad
men
were
of
that
breed
that
prefers
to
take
a
they
rode
their
jaded
horses
into
the
flood
until
the
yellow
waters
lapped
their
bellies
then
they
shot
them
and
shoved
the
carcasses
off
into
the
current
an
hour
later
the
three
bad
men
landed
on
the
california
side
near
bill
williams
mountain
filled
their
boat
with
stones
and
sank
it
and
shouldering
a
supply
of
food
and
water
sufficient
to
last
them
four
days
headed
up
a
long
box
canon
that
led
north
to
the
colorado
desert
they
made
fair
time
after
the
moon
came
up
all
night
long
they
trudged
through
the
box
canon
and
at
daylight
it
opened
out
into
the
waste
well
boys
i
guess
we
remarked
the
worst
bad
man
who
was
the
leader
of
the
trio
it
cooler
in
the
canon
so
suppose
we
camp
here
i
feel
like
breakfast
and
some
sleep
how
your
shoulder
bill
the
wounded
bad
man
shrugged
the
wounded
member
disdainfully
high
up
missed
the
bone
and
do
amount
to
much
tom
but
i
bled
like
a
stuck
pig
and
it
weakened
me
a
i
heat
some
water
and
wash
it
up
bill
said
the
youngest
bad
man
much
concerned
they
made
a
very
small
fire
of
and
ironwood
brewed
a
pot
of
coffee
breakfasted
washed
and
dressed
the
wounded
bad
man
shoulder
and
slept
until
late
afternoon
they
awoke
much
refreshed
ate
an
early
supper
and
struck
out
across
the
desert
to
the
north
where
in
time
they
would
come
to
the
santa
fe
tracks
there
were
lonely
stations
out
there
in
the
sands
they
might
be
worth
investigation
then
on
to
the
new
mining
camp
at
old
woman
mountain
a
camp
which
following
the
whimsical
and
fantastic
system
of
desert
nomenclature
which
seems
to
trend
toward
such
names
as
mecca
cadiz
bagdad
bengal
and
siam
had
had
bestowed
upon
it
the
not
inappropriate
name
of
new
jerusalem
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
three
bad
men
preferred
to
travel
by
night
primarily
they
were
prowlers
and
preferred
it
secondly
although
one
may
encounter
torrid
weather
by
day
on
the
colorado
desert
even
in
december
the
nights
on
the
contrary
are
bitterly
cold
and
the
three
bad
men
had
no
blankets
also
there
was
this
advantage
about
traveling
at
night
and
sleeping
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
by
day
they
would
not
meet
other
wanderers
and
there
would
he
no
embarrassing
questions
to
answer
respecting
the
hole
in
the
wounded
bad
man
shoulder
consequently
the
three
bad
men
traveled
by
night
from
mojave
tanks
they
swung
west
to
avoid
the
mining
operations
there
although
more
than
once
they
glanced
back
wistfully
at
the
little
cluster
of
yellow
lights
shining
across
the
sands
the
wounded
bad
man
shoulder
was
in
a
bad
way
and
needed
medical
attention
also
they
needed
water
but
they
were
and
could
last
until
they
came
to
malapai
springs
so
they
turned
their
backs
on
mojave
tanks
and
tramped
onward
now
they
were
in
the
ghostly
moonlight
of
the
open
desert
with
the
outlines
of
the
mountain
ranges
on
each
side
looming
dim
and
shadowy
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
away
now
they
were
picking
their
way
carefully
through
clusters
of
murderous
catclaw
through
tangles
of
mesquit
and
ironwood
up
dark
lonely
arroyos
they
went
down
long
alleys
between
the
outstretched
arms
of
the
ocatillas
with
their
pendulous
blossoms
passing
dried
withered
joshua
trees
twisted
into
fantastic
shapes
as
if
their
fearful
surroundings
had
caused
them
to
writhe
in
horror
through
solitude
and
desolation
so
vast
and
profound
as
to
inspire
one
with
the
thought
that
the
creator
appalled
at
the
magnitude
of
this
abortion
of
nature
had
set
it
apart
as
an
eternal
heritage
of
the
damned
in
the
forenoon
of
the
fifth
day
they
came
to
malapai
springs
here
the
three
bad
men
drank
deeply
bathed
filled
their
canteens
and
stepped
blithely
out
for
terrapin
tanks
the
next
a
and
consequently
unfrequented
spot
where
they
could
rest
for
a
few
days
before
attempting
the
last
desperate
leg
of
their
journey
to
the
railroad
do
stint
yourself
on
the
water
bill
the
worst
bad
man
advised
as
they
departed
from
malapai
springs
there
always
water
at
terrapin
nevertheless
with
the
instinct
of
the
the
worst
bad
man
and
the
youngest
bad
man
were
sparing
with
the
water
themselves
although
careful
to
conceal
this
fact
from
the
wounded
bad
man
the
latter
shoulder
was
swollen
and
inflamed
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
if
the
bandages
were
kept
wet
the
worst
bad
man
who
knew
the
country
better
than
his
companions
had
timed
their
arrival
at
terrapin
tanks
almost
to
the
hour
the
sun
was
just
coming
up
over
the
low
red
hummocks
of
hematite
to
the
eastward
when
the
three
bad
men
plodded
wearily
up
a
long
dry
canon
turned
a
sharp
rocky
promontory
into
an
arroyo
and
paused
borne
on
the
slight
desert
breeze
a
sound
came
to
them
from
up
the
arroyo
it
was
a
mournful
wailing
cry
and
ended
in
a
sob
a
sound
that
bespoke
pain
and
fear
and
misery
the
three
bad
men
looked
at
one
another
each
held
up
an
index
finger
enjoining
silence
a
second
a
third
time
the
sound
was
repeated
it
a
human
voice
announced
the
worst
bad
man
an
there
death
in
it
wait
here
i
goin
in
to
see
what
when
he
had
gone
the
youngest
bad
man
after
the
restless
and
inquisitive
manner
of
youth
climbed
a
tall
rock
and
gazed
up
the
arroyo
i
see
the
top
of
a
covered
wagon
he
announced
then
said
the
wounded
bad
man
it
a
tenderfoot
outfit
an
a
woman
cryin
no
desert
rat
come
here
with
a
wagon
fools
drive
in
where
burros
fear
to
tread
bob
they
that
right
agreed
the
youngest
bad
man
some
nester
come
in
over
the
trail
from
imperial
valley
and
bound
for
new
jerusalem
i
bet
a
new
whoever
doin
that
whimperin
is
sure
bound
for
new
jerusalem
the
wounded
bad
man
replied
with
a
grim
attempt
at
humor
an
if
i
let
a
doctor
look
at
this
shoulder
o
mine
before
long
i
head
that
way
the
worst
bad
man
was
gone
about
ten
minutes
presently
the
others
saw
him
returning
on
his
hard
sunscorched
face
deep
concern
showed
plainly
and
as
he
trotted
down
the
arroyo
he
scratched
his
unkempt
head
as
if
in
search
of
an
idea
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
cope
with
a
grave
situation
when
he
reached
his
comrades
he
sat
down
on
a
chunk
of
black
lava
and
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
there
a
fine
old
state
of
affairs
at
the
tanks
he
said
huskily
they
ai
dry
are
they
fright
showed
in
the
wide
blue
eyes
of
the
youngest
bad
man
the
wounded
bad
man
sat
down
very
suddenly
and
gulped
the
worst
bad
man
replied
to
the
question
the
wounded
bad
man
sighed
it
ca
be
he
said
there
a
wagon
at
the
tanks
continued
the
worst
bad
man
but
no
horses
it
a
tenderfoot
outfit
a
man
an
his
woman
an
they
come
in
from
salton
via
canon
springs
and
boulder
headed
for
new
jerusalem
some
o
their
kin
has
started
a
boardin
tent
in
the
new
camp
an
these
two
misfortunates
were
aimin
to
go
in
with
the
rush
an
clean
up
a
stake
they
make
terrapin
tanks
all
right
but
the
water
a
little
low
an
the
man
ai
got
sense
enough
to
dig
out
the
sand
an
let
the
water
run
in
he
one
of
these
nervous
city
fellers
i
guess
and
it
just
naturally
hurts
him
to
set
down
an
wait
till
that
fills
up
besides
he
do
take
kindly
to
usin
a
shovel
so
he
sticks
in
a
shot
o
dynamite
to
clean
out
th
tanks
an
start
the
water
runnin
the
wounded
bad
man
sprang
to
his
feet
cursing
horribly
the
damned
crazy
fool
he
raved
i
kill
him
i
will
i
kill
him
just
as
sure
as
i
the
worst
bad
man
paid
no
attention
to
the
other
outburst
so
he
stuck
in
his
stick
o
dynamite
an
it
only
a
fool
luck
he
did
blow
himself
up
doin
it
i
wisht
he
had
but
he
did
he
just
put
terrapin
tanks
out
o
business
forever
cracked
the
granite
floor
that
an
busted
down
the
sides
an
the
water
run
out
into
the
sand
an
the
tanks
run
dry
they
stay
dry
we
can
have
cloudbursts
in
this
country
from
now
until
i
get
religion
but
them
tanks
never
hold
another
drop
o
water
that
fool
tenderfoot
dead
i
guess
but
he
goin
to
keep
right
on
killin
people
just
the
same
men
keep
comin
here
bankin
on
water
an
in
five
years
there
be
a
dozen
skeletons
round
that
busted
but
all
that
ai
what
bitin
me
half
as
hard
as
what
he
went
done
next
he
went
an
let
his
stock
nose
round
an
lick
up
that
alkali
slop
below
the
tanks
an
drove
they
took
off
up
the
canon
huntin
water
with
man
after
that
was
four
days
ago
an
he
ai
come
back
yet
so
we
do
need
to
waste
no
time
speculatin
on
his
case
an
feelin
sorry
for
him
it
would
been
so
bad
but
he
went
an
left
his
woman
alone
at
th
tanks
she
had
a
little
water
left
so
she
was
so
bad
off
until
yesterday
when
it
give
out
it
been
pretty
hard
on
her

alone

the
worst

by
a
long
shot
she

to
have
a
the
youngest
bad
man
and
the
wounded
bad
man
voiced
the
horrified
exclamation
in
unison
then
the
wounded
bad
man
sank
back
against
a
rock
yes
the
worst
bad
man
affirmed
huskily

baby

for
her
an
she
cryin
an
prayin
and
askin
for
help
an
i
do
know
the
worst
bad
man
choked
and
hid
his
hard
face
in
his
hands
he
shook
like
a
hooked
fish
silence
while
the
worst
bad
man
fought
for
control
of
himself
i
a
tough
old
bird
he
said
presently
i
an
awful
tough
old
bird
but
i
ca
go
back
there

to
come
with
me

hopefully
to

wounded
bad

said
pleadingly

about
such
cases

a
girl

rio

the
wounded
bad
man
was
on
the
defensive
instantly
yes

true
he
admitted
with
some
show
of
reluctance
but
then
tom
you
know
as
well
as
me
that
injuns

different
they
an
this
here
a
white
woman

of
the
wisdom
of
his
summers
hastened
to
bill
assistance
an
with
a
white
woman
means
doctors
an
nurses

the
wounded
bad
man

woman

them

into

world
one
day

livin
for
the
well
retorted
the
bedeviled
worst
bad
man
i
was
tryin
to
pass
the
buck
just
around
for
he
rose
wearily
come
on
he
growled
and
led
the
way
the
three
bad
men
walked
up
the
draw
to
terrapin
tanks
in
reverential
awe
they
stood
beside
the
covered
wagon
parted
the
side
curtains
and
looked
in
on
a
straw
tick
covered
with
blankets
lay
a
woman
she
was
young
with
great
brown
eyes
alight
with
fever
and
with
the
luster
of
approaching
motherhood
a
long
braid
of
brown
hair
lay
across
her
white
breast
she
moaned
in
her
pain
and
terror
and
wretchedness
the
wounded
bad
man
found
a
tin
cup
and
gave
her
generously
of
his
all
too
scant
supply
of
water
the
youngest
bad
man
got
a
clean
towel
out
of
the
wet
it
and
washed
her
burning
face
and
hands
the
worst
bad
man
whose
courage
for
all
his
deviltry
had
its
limitations
went
and
sat
down
on
the
tongue
of
the
wagon
and
tried
to
think
but
scourged
with
the
horror
of
this
most
terrible
of
human
travail
he
fled
up
the
arroyo
out
of
hearing
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
little
black
volcanic
hills
from
which
eminence
he
could
look
down
on
the
wagon
he
stood
active
alert
like
a
mountain
sheep
on
guard
and
beckoned
to
his
friends
to
join
him
the
youngest
bad
man
obeyed
his
frantic
signals
but
the
wounded
bad
man
stayed
at
the
wagon
you
got
to
be
easy
on
me
son
at
a
time
like
this
said
the
worst
bad
man
humbly
i
an
awful
tough
old
bird
but
i
ca
stand
that
it
ai
no
place
for
the
likes
o
me
what
to

done
nothin
much
i
the
youngest
bad
man
threw
out
his
hands
in
desperation
bill
says
she
ai
got
a
he
took
his
canteen
in
both
hands
and
shook
it
gently
seeing
which
the
worst
bad
man
did
the
same
with
his
how
much
has
bill
got
left
he
asked
anxiously
nary
drop
he
been
right
feverish
along
o
that
hole
in
his
wing
hittin
his
canteen
heavy
expectin
to
find
water
in
the
well
we
got
about
two
gallons
left
announced
the
worst
bad
man
philosophically
but
i
see
us
cuttin
niggerhead
cactus
before
we
hit
another
tank
once
in
san
berdoo
i
heard
a
preachin
he
that
the
way
o
the
transgressor
bound
to
be
hard
but
dogged
if
i
looked
for
anythin
half
as
hard
as
this
bill
you
son
better
lope
back
to
the
wagon
i
i
guess
i
wait
he
waited
half
an
hour
watching
with
anxious
and
paternal
eyes
the
activities
of
his
fellows
at
the
wagon
once
the
sounds
of
woe
drifted
up
to
him
and
he
moved
farther
up
the
canon
here
he
waited
and
presently
the
wounded
bad
man
joined
him
what
luck
bill
he
demanded
a
boy
responded
the
wounded
bad
man
come
on
down
an
look
at
him
tom
he
worth
it
he
man
how
about
that
misfortunate
girl
she
ai
to
last
long
tom
she
fast
an
she
wants
to
see
you
all
of
us
together
she
quiet
thus
reassured
the
worst
bad
man
returned
with
the
wounded
bad
man
to
the
tanks
with
uncovered
head
he
approached
the
wagon
dreading
to
gaze
upon
that
tragic
face
drawn
with
agony
but
lo
as
he
parted
the
curtains
he
gazed
upon
the
miracle
of
motherhood
gone
were
the
lines
of
suffering
the
girl
face
was
transfigured
with
the
light
of
that
joy
and
peace
and
pride
that
god
gives
to
mothers
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
hard
life
the
worst
bad
man
was
permitted
to
glimpse
something
of
the
glory
of
his
creator
the
babe
wrapped
in
a
coarse
crash
towel
lay
in
the
hollow
of
the
little
mother
arm
its
red
puckered
little
face
rested
on
her
snowy
bosom
the
while
she
gazed
downward
at
her
treasure
it
came
to
the
worst
bad
man
very
suddenly
that
once
upon
a
time
a
woman
had
gazed
upon
him
with
that
same
look
of
yearning
and
joy
ineffable
and
with
the
thought
he
reached
for
the
mother
left
hand
and
carried
it
to
his
cracked
and
blistered
lips
he
spoke
no
word
but
as
he
bowed
his
reckless
head
reverently
over
that
fevered
hand
he
seemed
to
cry
aloud
here
is
my
wasted
and
worthless
life
i
offer
it
in
exchange
for
the
girl
mother
calm
benevolent
eyes
beamed
their
gratitude
she
understood
and
like
a
true
mother
she
accepted
his
tribute
only
the
sacrifice
could
not
be
for
her
what
is
your
name
she
asked
wearily
tom
and
yours
turning
to
the
wounded
bad
man
bill
she
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
youngest
bad
man
bob
sangster
he
replied
will
you
save
my
baby
slowly
searchingly
the
wonderful
eyes
confronted
each
bad
man
in
turn
i
save
him
promised
the
youngest
bad
man
with
all
the
rashness
the
unthinking
unreasoning
confidence
and
generosity
of
youth
he
passed
his
word
he
recked
not
of
the
long
trail
ahead
with
death
for
the
pacemaker
he
only
knew
that
this
woman
of
sorrow
had
gazed
longest
upon
him
estimating
the
strength
in
his
lithe
big
body
searching
for
his
manhood
in
the
face
where
sin
had
not
yet
laid
its
devastating
hand
so
he
passed
his
word
and
passing
it
in
all
the
regal
simplicity
of
the
brave
the
mother
knew
that
he
would
keep
it
i
help
croaked
the
wounded
bad
man
humbly
he
glanced
at
the
worst
bad
man
who
bowed
his
head
once
more
over
the
little
hand
i
help
i
want
you
all
of
you
to
be
my
baby
godfathers
poor
little
son
he
be
all
alone
in
this
big
world
when
his
mamma
leaves
him
and
going
to
miss
her
so
are
you
sweetheart
nobody
to
tuck
you
into
bed
at
night
nobody
to
teach
you
your
prayers
nobody
to
kiss
the
little
sore
spots
when
you
fall
and
hurt
yourself
nobody
to
tell
your
little
secrets
to
she
closed
her
eyes
a
tear
stole
through
between
the
long
lashes
and
the
wounded
bad
man
turned
away
the
youngest
bad
man
went
and
sat
down
on
the
wagon
tongue
and
wept
for
he
was
young
only
the
worst
bad
man
stayed
watching
waiting
and
presently
the
mother
spoke
again
are
you
all
here
it
getting
dark
and
we
must
be
moving
on
to
the
next
waterhole
you

sangster

him
did
you
and
bill
kearny
and
tom
gibbons
will

be
his
godfathers
and
help
bob
sangster
on
the
trail
will
you
promise
me
again
and
his
name
call
him
robert
william
thomas
sangster
and
when
he
a
fine
big
brave
man
like
his
godfathers
you
tell
him
about
his
little
mother
who
wanted
to
live
for
him
so
lift
him
up
godfathers
and
let
me
kiss
my
the
worst
bad
man
waited
until
the
last
fluttering
little
sigh
was
finished
before
he
removed
the
infant
the
wounded
bad
man
closed
the
mother
eyes
and
folded
her
hands
across
her
pulseless
breast
the
youngest
bad
man
stood
grasping
the
until
his
knuckles
showed
white
with
the
strain
of
the
grip
long
he
stood
there
gazing
at
that
calm
spiritual
face
with
its
halo
of
glistening
brown
hair
pondering
deeply
on
the
mysteries
of
birth
and
life
and
death
to
him
it
all
seemed
a
monstrous
thing
and
when
the
worst
bad
man
came
to
him
with
a
shovel
he
wept
aloud
death
is
a
terrible
thing
tom
he
sobbed
life
worse
said
the
wounded
bad
man
gently
he
was
seated
apart
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
shielding
it
from
the
sun
with
his
broad
sombrero
death
can
only
get
you
once
but
life
is
a
ghost
dance
i
wonder
what
it
has
in
store
for
you
kidlets
i
the
youngest
bad
man
departed
down
the
arroyo
with
the
shovel
and
the
worst
bad
man
discovering
a
hammer
and
nails
in
the
toolbox
under
the
scat
removed
the
side
boards
and
some
strips
from
the
wagon
bed
and
fell
briskly
to
work
when
the
wounded
bad
man
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
youngest
bad
man
was
nor
within
hearing
he
spoke
i
say
tom
did
you
notice
her
when
she
asked
us
to
save
the
baby
she
picked
on
bob
seems
as
if
she
i
noticed
i
guess
she
knew
they
say
angels
always
does
know
miles
to
new
jerusalem
bill
and
you
ca
make
it
and
i
i
too
old
for
a
long
stretch
without
that
why
i
said
i
same
we
got
to
do
the
first
two
heats
tom
we
got
to
save
young
strength
for
the
final
dash
i
carry
the
baby
an
you
carry
the
grub
an
things
tonight
an
tomorrow
night
i
carry
everything
tomorrow
night
after
that
it
be
up
to
bob
he
young
and
hard
and
game
he
ought
to
make
late
in
the
afternoon
with
clumsy
tenderness
they
buried
the
martyred
mother
there
by
the
terrapin
tanks
built
a
cairn
over
the
grave
and
crowned
it
with
a
cross
then
they
returned
to
the
dismantled
wagon
to
hold
a
consultation
the
wounded
bad
man
was
the
first
to
broach
the
subject
closest
to
the
hearts
of
all
three
with
characteristic
directness
he
shot
his
query
at
them
all
his
wicked
life
he
had
been
facing
desperate
issues
long
since
he
had
learned
to
face
them
unblinkingly
robert
william
thomas
got
to
have
a
bath
ai
he
the
youngest
bad
man
took
hold
of
the
brake
rod
again
and
steadied
himself
the
worst
bad
man
looked
at
the
wounded
godfather
in
vague
surprise
i
never
figgered
on
that
at
all
he
said
simply
i
was
thinkin
about
how
we
to
feed
him
i
for
tubbin
him
all
right
but
he
held
up
the
two
canteens
his
pause
was
eloquent
but
he
such
a
little
feller
it
wo
take
much
protested
the
wounded
bad
man
he
fit
nice
in
a
i
wish
he
was
old
enough
to
stagger
along
a
few
days
without
bathin
mourned
the
youngest
bad
man
maybe
he
can
i
do
know
a
thing
about
infants
but
if
he
must
be
bathed
why
i
guess
we
better
i
to
ask
his
mother
a
few
questions
regardin
his
and
interrupted
the
wounded
bad
man
apologetically
but
i
clean
the
worst
bad
man
wagged
his
head
as
if
to
convey
the
impression
that
this
was
a
pardonable
oversight
indeed
he
was
thinking
it
stands
to
reason
he
announced
presently
that
this
mother
naturally
made
some
provision
for
his
reception
into
camp
my
opinion
that
gettin
a
bath
is
the
least
o
the
troubles
our
godson
he
just
naturally
got
to
eat
an
wear
somethin
a
towel
that
plum
scratch
the
hide
him
there
ought
to
be
somethin
for
robert
boy
in
that
so
they
searched
the
tailbox
and
discovered
many
things
condensed
milk
a
carton
of
soda
crackers
a
quart
bottle
of
olive
oil
a
feeding
bottle
two
bluffers
with
real
ivory
rings
and
an
assortment
of
baby
clothes
many
of
them
hemstitched
and
worked
through
long
months
of
loving
anticipation
the
silence
was
pregnant
of
tears
as
the
worst
bad
man
held
up
a
wee
woolen
undershirt
and
two
little
stockings
that
might
have
been
cut
from
the
index
fingers
of
a
pair
of
woolen
mittens
the
trio
surveyed
them
wonderingly
before
returning
to
the
search
of
the
tailbox
ah
here
we
are
tom
all
fine
and
dandy
announced
the
wounded
bad
man
fishing
up
a
book
from
the
recesses
of
the
tailbox
meecham
on
carin
for
the
baby
let
see
what
the
doc
has
to
say
about
here
another
said
the
worst
bad
man
picking
up
another
book
and
skimming
through
the
first
few
pages
but
it
do
say
about
it
a
bible
he
tossed
it
from
him
contemptuously
and
the
youngest
bad
man
still
under
the
spell
of
his
youth
and
its
resultant
curiosity
retrieved
the
bible
the
worst
bad
man
in
the
mean
time
peered
over
the
shoulder
of
the
wounded
bad
man
turn
to
the
part
on
bathin
the
baby
bill
he
commanded
hum
let
me
see
all
right
bathin
the
baby
too
much
care
can
not
be
exercised
in
performin
this
most
important
part
of
the
baby
toilette
what
in
blazes
is
a
toilette
demanded
the
worst
bad
man
the
wounded
ban
man
thereupon
looked
into
the
tailbox
as
if
in
search
of
it
i
guess
our
baby
ai
got
no
toilette
in
his
war
bags
he
replied
sadly
a
toilette
he
continued
is
a
little
green
tin
bathtub
about
as
long
as
my
arm
cost
about
in
any
hardware
you
bob
you
hear
that
admonished
the
worst
bad
man
when
you
get
to
new
jerusalem
you
send
out
to
an
round
up
the
best
toilette
money
can
buy
remember
that
bob
crack
right
along
bill
what
does
the
doc
say
next
the
first
bath
the
first
bath
should
not
be
administered
until
the
baby
is
at
least
three
days
old
bill
said
the
worst
bad
man
looking
solemnly
at
his
companion
if
i
had
a
sick
tomcat
i
would
send
for
doc
meecham
three
days
without
a
bath
that
all
right
when
the
boy
a
an
ai
supposed
to
bathe
between
waterholes
when
he
in
the
desert
or
every
saturday
night
when
he
in
town
but
with
new
babies
i
lay
you
my
silver
spurs
tis
different
the
doc
wrong
bill
but
come
thus
encouraged
the
wounded
bad
man
read
immediately
after
birth
the
nurse
should
rub
the
entire
body
with
olive
oil
or
if
that
is
not
available
with
some
clean
pure
grease
or
the
wounded
bad
man
closed
the
book
but
kept
his
finger
in
to
mark
the
place
it
do
sound
regular
tom
i
admit
but
there
a
bottle
of
olive
oil
in
the
tailbox
so
it
looks
like
robert
william
thomas
was
due
for
a
greasin
up
in
accordance
with
the
doctor
the
worst
bad
man
pondered
well
i
ai
convinced
nohow
he
said
presently
this
godson
o
ours
is
startin
life
slippery
enough
with
us
for
his
he
pondered
a
moment
or
two
longer
still
it
we
follow
the
book
it
may
save
robert
from
chafin
an
gettin
saddle
galls
on
him
hand
over
the
ile
bob
an
we
slick
the
young
feller
up
a
mite
it
just
the
tenderness
o
hell
we
do
have
to
use
the
wounded
bad
man
held
the
naked
babe
in
his
lap
across
which
he
had
spread
the
towel
and
the
worst
bad
man
applied
the
oil
roll
him
over
the
wounded
bad
man
rolled
him
over
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
task
was
completed
dressing
the
infant
however
was
infinitely
more
laborious
the
godfathers
knowing
something
of
the
biting
chill
of
the
desert
nights
were
grateful
for
the
profusion
of
woolen
clothing
and
delicate
woolen
baby
blankets
which
their
search
of
the
tailbox
had
netted
and
when
in
due
course
the
youngest
bad
man
had
succeeded
in
dressing
the
infant
after
a
nondescript
fashion
of
his
own
the
worst
bad
man
corked
the
olive
oil
bottle
wiped
his
hands
on
his
trousers
and
beamed
with
the
consciousness
of
a
duty
well
performed
next
the
wounded
bad
man
ran
his
horny
thumb
down
the
index
of
doctor
meecham
on
caring
for
the
baby
until
he
came
to
the
chapter
entitled
feeding
the
this
chapter
he
real
aloud
this
is
comfortin
he
remarked
turning
down
the
leaf
to
mark
the
page
doctor
meecham
says
that
there
times
when
a
baby
wo
thrive
on
nothin
else
but
condensed
milk
we
got
plenty
o
yes
an
we
can
maul
up
some
o
them
sody
crackers
an
make
some
pap
for
him
replied
the
worst
bad
man
an

proceeded
to

from
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
and
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
jerusalem
and
were
come
to
bethphage
unto
the
mount
of
olives
then
sent
jesus
two
disciples
saying
unto
them
go
into
the
village
over
against
you
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
tied
and
a
colt
with

unto
you
ye
shall
say
the
lord
hath
need
of
them
and
straightway
he
will
send

the
worst
bad
man
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
try
swipin
a
man
jacks
with
or
without
a
colt
in
this
country
an
see
what
happens
if
you
say
the
lord
hath
need
of
them
the
lord
wo
save
you
nohow
but
cut
out
this
religious
talk
bob
an
rustle
up
some
sagebrush
for
a
fire
we
heat
some
of
this
airtight
milk
and
feed
our
godson
before
we
the
fire
was
lit
forthwith
and
the
condensed
milk
prepared
according
to
the
instructions
laid
down
by
doctor
meecham
the
worst
bad
man
poured
the
water
while
the
other
two
godfathers
guarded
jealously
every
drop
he
heated
the
mixture
to
the
proper
temperature
warmed
the
feeding
bottle
in
it
and
then
filled
the
bottle
the
wounded
bad
man
sat
with
the
baby
in
his
lap
and
pressed
the
feeding
bottle
to
the
little
stranger
lips
it
was
an
anxious
moment
to
the
three
godfathers
would
he
or
would
he
not
take
hold
he
did
promptly
with
a
gusto
that
brought
a
howl
of
delight
from
the
worst
bad

admire
to
see
the
way
that
young

hills
toward

springing
up

the
thirsty
godfathers
not

double
blanket
reposing
in

hollow
of
the

sound
arm
the

was
drawn

very
haggard
and

staggered
slightly
from

once
or
twice
in

forehead
with

great
sunburnt
nose
now
he
raised
his
head
quickly
and
his
face
was
terrible
to
behold

o

greasewood
that
helps
some
the
wounded

man
growled
out
the
words
again
they
walked
on
in
silence
hour
after
hour
presently
as
they
trudged
along
the
worst
bad
man
began
lighting
matches
nine
he
announced
third
for
robert
william
thomas
we
make
a
dry
camp
an
heat
some
more
milk
listen
from
a
draw
to
the
right
there
came
borne
on
the
night
wind
the
sound
of
savage
growling
and
yelping
as
of
dogs
quarreling
ever
a
bone
coyotes
the
youngest
bad
man
elucidated
they
got
move
along
out
o
here
cried
the
wounded
bad
man
irritably
i
want
to
listen
to
that
they
get
me
soon
they
moved
farther
up
the
draw
and
camped
for
half
an
hour
again
the
wounded
bad
man
fed
the
baby
and
once
more
they
swung
away
on
their
sorry
road
to
new
jerusalem
toward
morning
the
baby
awoke
and
whimpered
and
the
wounded
bad
man
who
never
once
during
the
long
night
had
relinquished
his
trust
sought
to
soothe
it
with
song
i
oh
ella
ree
so
kind
an
true
in
th
little
churchyard
lies
her
grave
is
bright
with
drops
o
dew
but
brighter
were
her
eyes
then
carry
me
back
to
tennessee
there
let
me
it
was
a
melody
of
his
childhood
his
mother
had
sung
it
to
him
in
the
old
lost
days
of
his
youth
and
innocence
and
the
plaintive
ballad
came
cracked
and
quavering
through
lips
swollen
with
suffering
it
was
a
mournful
song
but
it
seemed
appropriate
for
the
wounded
bad
man
was
thinking
of
the
little
mother
away
off
there
in
the
silence
at
terrapin
tanks
whether
from
this
or
physical
inability
to
proceed
farther
his
voice
broke
in
the
second
line
of
the
chorus
dog
my
cats
he
gasped
feebly
i
ca
sing
a
lick
no
more
i

volunteered
the
youngest
bad
man
give
him
yeller
rose
o
they
made
fifteen
miles
that
first
night
and
at
they
emerged
from
the
black
volcanic
hills
out
on
to
a
great
white
shimmering
dry
salt
lake
a
mile
away
a
little
cabin
dazzling
white
in
the
glint
of
the
rising
sun
flared
against
the
horizon
and
far
to
the
northeast
the
witch
of
old
woman
mountain
sat
watching
them
over
there
on
the
southeast
spur
of
old
woman
you
find
new
jerusalem
bob
the
worst
bad
man
explained
that

the
witch
bob

the
youngest

with
him
till

across
with
reluctantly
the
wounded
bad
man
surrendered
the
child
to
the
youngest
bad
man
the
latter
was
drawn
and
weary
himself
but
he
had
what
neither
of
his
comrades
possessed
he
had
glorious
youth
he
would
still
be
on
his
feet
and
traveling
with
his
godson
when
the
coyotes
would
be
quarreling
over
the
others
he
trotted
off
now
in
a
hurry
to
reach
the
lone
cabin
before
the
heat
became
too
oppressive
the
worst
bad
man
looked
after
him
enviously
what
a
man
he
muttered
lean
an
long
an
tough
if
we
strike
some
niggerhead
cactus
he
get
through
he
can
last
two
days
but
i
do
see
no
niggerhead
cactus
complained
the
wounded
bad
man
it
ten
miles
across
this
salt
lake
an
he
swayed
and
fell
on
his
hands
and
knees
the
worst
bad
man
helped
him
up
they
stood
for
a
moment
leaning
against
each
other
resting
then
plodded
weakly
on
the
worst
bad
man
was
the
first
to
speak
his
tongue
was
dry
and
swollen
but
he
could
still
speak
plainly
d
remember
bill
that
yarn
that
bob
read
us
outen
that
bible
last
night
about
christ
ridin
into
jerusalem
an
him
two
men
over
to
the
nearest
camp
for
a
jinny
with
a
colt
it
kinder
set
me
thinkin
an
i
been
wonderin
all
night
bill
do
you
believe
in
god
i
dunno
the
wounded
bad
man
replied
thickly
i
use
to
but
i
dunno
now
i
seen
things
yesterday
in
that
woman
eyes
when
she
talked
about
the
baby
not
havin
anybody
to
teach
him
his
prayers
him
growin
up
a
fine
good
man
i
been
wonderin
too
tom
you
do
suppose
tom
that
the
bible
wrong
and
that
christ
sent
three
disciples
instead
o
two
why
because
the
wounded
bad
man
paused
and
looked
at
his
companion
very
impressively
i
kinder
feel
like
me
an
you
an
bob
was
disciples
since
i
seen
that
girl
an
held
that
little
mite
of
a
kid
in
my
arms
i
been
figgerin
it
out
tom
an
i
allow
that
bob
ought
to
make
jerusalem
with
robert
william
thomas
some
time
christmas
mornin
the
thought
comforted
me
a
heap
somehow
i
sorter
got
the
notion
that
there
ca
no
hard
luck
come
to
a
christmas
baby
an
christ
just
naturally
ca
go
back
on
us
if
we
play
the
game
fair
by
that
the
worst
bad
man
nodded
grave
approval
to
these
sentiments
the
wounded
bad
man
continued
it
sorter
sets
my
mind
back
years
my
folks
used
to
take
me
to
church
when
i
was
a
kid
i
was
a
churchgoer
by
nature
but
there
was
one
picture
on
the
wall
of
that
church
of
a
naked
baby
lyin
in
his
mother
lap
an
when
the
sun
come
streamin
in
through
them
windows
it
used
to
light
up
their
faces
kinder
beautiful
an
yesterday
mornin
when
the
sun
here
the
wounded
had
man
stumbled
and
fell
once
more
he
picked
himself
up
and
continued
wearily
and
when
the
sun
come
streakin
over
the
terrapin
tanks
an
shone
into
that
wagon
i
swear
to
god
tom
it
was
the
same
two
faces
the
worst
bad
man
made
no
reply
privately
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
his
companion
was
delirious
the
latter
next
remark
however
precluded
this
idea
we
ai
done
right
by
young
bob
he
complained
we
a
pair
o
hard
old
skunks
tom
an
we
kinder
influenced
that
boy
he
ai
bad
there
ai
nothin
naturally
crooked
in
bob
just
young
an
thinks
he
havin
adventures
an
makin
a
big
man
of
himself
that
job
at
wickenburg
was
the
first
trick
he
ever
turned
before
you
boys
leave
me
i
goin
to
talk
to
bob
i
going
to
talk
while
i
got
my
voice
because
by
noon
my
tongue
be
out
of
kilter
i
talk
to
him
too
assented
the
worst
bad
man
eagerly
i
was
thinkin
the
same
thoughts
as
you
bill
the
last
o
the
godfathers
ca
be
no
crook
bill
he
got
to
do
his
duty
by
the
an
hour
later
they
arrived
at
the
white
cabin
on
the
dry
salt
lake
it
was
not
the
kind
of
house
one
sees
in
cities
for
it
was
built
entirely
of
blocks
of
rock
salt
of
such
crystal
clearness
that
as
the
two
godfathers
approached
they
could
discern
the
vague
outlines
of
boh
sangster
sitting
inside
with
the
baby
the
roof
of
the
house
was
of
canvas
rotten
and
filled
with
holes
evidently
the
strange
habitation
had
been
the
abode
of
some
desert
visionary
who
planned
to
file
on
the
salt
lake
and
sell
his
concession
to
the
salt
trust
the
youngest
bad
man
gave
the
baby
into
the
keeping
of
the
wounded
bad
man
once
more
while
he
and
the
worst
bad
man
busied
themselves
spreading
the
double
blanket
over
the
ruined
canvas
roofing
to
keep
out
the
sun
next
they
prepared
some
condensed
milk
and
set
the
feeding
bottle
out
in
the
hot
salt
gravel
until
it
should
be
heated
to
the
right
temperature
and
while
they
waited
sitting
there
in
silence
the
wounded
bad
man
leaned
back
against
the
salt
wall
and
closed
his
tired
eyes
the
worst
bad
man
stooped
and
took
the
baby
from
him
yet
he
did
not
seem
to
be
aware
of
this
action
this
was
a
bad
sign
the
youngest
bad
man
shook
his
head
dubiously
presently
the
wounded
bad
man
spoke
his
speech

very
thick
and
labored
like
that
of
a
paralyzed

and
jesus
called

little
child
unto

and
set
him
in
the
midst
of

and
said

it
again
the
wounded

man
commanded
the
youngest
bad
man
opened
it
at
random
and
read
from
the
gospel
according
to
luke
and
one
of
the
malefactors
which
were
hanged
railed
on
him
saying
if
thou
be
christ
save
thyself
and
us
but
the
other
answering
rebuked
him
saying
dost
not
thou
fear
god
seeing
thou
art
in
the
same
condemnation
and
we
indeed
justly
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
deeds
but
this
man
hath
done
nothing
amiss
and
he
said
unto
jesus
lord

me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom
and
jesus
said
unto
him
verily

say
unto
thee

they
bent
over
the
wounded
bad
man
and
listened
intently
for
it
seemed
to
them
he
was
wandering
far
afield
in
his
delirium
he
was
bill
kearny
body
was
dying
but
his
soul
was
wandering
adown
the
wild
and
checkered
path
of

dim
and
distant
starting
point

amen
the
worst
bad
man
face
twitched
a
little
good
jesus
christ
he
murmured
the
words
were
not
a
blasphemy
they
fell
from
his
blackened
lips
like
a
benediction
in
his
fierce
eyes
a
soft
and
human
light
was
beaming
jesus
christ
good
he
slippin
it
easy
to
old
bill
he
made
him
a
child
throughout
the
long
stifling
day
they
sat
and
watched
him
and
when
he
became
delirious
the
youngest
bad
man
took
the
baby
in
hand
in
case
the
wounded
bad
man
should
suddenly
become
violent
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
baby
had
been
fed
and
wrapped
again
in
the
blanket
preparatory
to
taking
the
trail
once
more
the
dying
godfather
rolled
over
and
opened
his
eyes
they
bent
to
hear
his
last
message
it
was
almost
unintelligible
it
a
christmas
baby
it
belongs
in
jerus
alem
stick
it
out
to
finish
good
boys
let
my
godson
die
between
two
thieves
they
pressed
his
hand
the
worst
bad
man
had
the
pack
ready
and
slipped
it
over
his
weary
shoulders
he
reached
for
the
baby
gim
me
the
kid
he
cried
thickly
i
got
ten
miles
left
in
me
yet
see
you
across
the
dry
the
youngest
bad
man
understood
now
he
handed
over
the
baby
and
together
the
two
godfathers
passed
out
of
the
shack
into
the
great
salt
desert
and
some
time
during
the
night
the
angels
came
and
led
bill
kearny
into
paradise
after
leaving
the
cabin
the
worst
bad
man
realizing
that
the
next
ten
miles
of
their
journey
across
the
salt
lake
offered
free
smooth
footing
resolved
to
make
the
pace
while
the
going
was
good
they
were
no
longer
hampered
by
being
forced
to
suit
their
gait
to
that
of
bill
kearny
and
the
worst
bad
man
was
resolved
to
see
his
godson
safe
across
the
dry
lake
before
surrendering
he
swayed
considerably
as
he
walked
but
the
youngest
bad
man
strode
beside
him
with
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
helped
to
hold
him
steady
and
as
they
proceeded
the
worst
bad
man
talked
to
bob
sangster
it
was
a
short
sermon
evolved
in
terse
eloquent
sentences
from
out
the
bitterness
of
the
worst
bad
man
dark
past
and
still
darker
future
bill
kearny
never
went
back
on
a

two
men
died
to
make
a
man
outer
him
that
all
i
ai
goin
to
try
to
talk
no
at
midnight
the
worst
bad
man
was
very
weak
he
swayed
and
staggered
and
stopped
every
few
hundred
yards
to
rest
but
he
would
not
give
up
the
baby
i
last
till
he
told
himself
i
got
to
i
ai
the
quittin
about
two
in
the
morning
the
moon
came
out
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
coyote
gave
tongue
and
the
worst
bad
man
shivered
a
little
at
three
they
came
out
of
the
dry
salt
lake
into
the
sands
again
and
the
youngest
bad
man
held
out
his
arms
for
the
baby
he
needs
grub
mighty
bad
was
what
the
worst
bad
man
tried
to
say
but
the
words
came
only
as
an
unintelligible
mumble
there
had
been
no
sage
on
the
dry
lake
and
they
had
been
unable
to
make
a
fire
for
two
hours
the
baby
had
been
whimpering
with
hunger
and
cold
the
worst
bad
man
slipped
out
of
his
pack
gathered
some
dry
sagebrush
and
lit
a
roaring
fire
while
his
youthful
companion
ministered
to
the
baby
and
when
bob
had
finished
the
worst
bad
man
smoothed
a
area
in
the
sand
and
by
the
light
of
the
campfire
he
wrote
with
his
finger
the
words
that
he
could
not
speak
you
carry
baby
i
good
two
three
miles
more
with
pack
i
leave
you
twelve
miles
from
new
jerusalem
do
lay
up
today
keep
moving
put
baby
half
rations
the
youngest
bad
man
nodded
when
dawn
began
to
show
in
the
east
they
resumed
the
journey
after
the
first
mile
the
worst
bad
man
gave
signs
that
the
end
was
coming
very
soon
he
fell
more
frequently
barking
his
hands
and
knees
filling
his
mouth
and
eyes
with
sand
tearing
his
flesh
in
the
catclaws
weary
monotonous
gasps
came
from
his
constricted
throat
but
still
he
staggered
along
although
his
strength
had
been
gone
for
hours
he
was
traveling
on
his
nerve
now
slowly
the
dawnlight
crept
over
the
desert
softening
with
its
magic
beauty
the
harsh
empire
of
death
the
worst
bad
man
saw
the
rosy
glow
lighting
up
the
saturnine
face
of
the
witch
of
old
woman
mountain
and
was
content
he
had
promised
himself
to
last
till
dawn
he
had
kept
his
word
he
sank
to
his
knees
in
the
sand
bob
sangster
stooped
and
lifted
him
to
his
feet
he
staggered
along
a
few
yards
and
fell
again
and
when
bob
sangster
would
fain
have
lifted
him
once
more
the
worst
bad
man
motioned
him
back
with
an
imperious
wave
of
his
hand
for
he
did
not
want
the
boy
to
waste
his
strength
he
tried
to
protest
verbally
but
a
horrible
sound
was
all
that
came
from
his
swollen
mouth
the
youngest
bad
man
tarried
for
a
moment
irresolute
standing
over
him
the
worst
bad
man
deliberately
removed
his
hat
and
handed
it
to
the
young
godfather
who
took
it
fitted
a
branch
of
sagebrush
with
three
forks
at
one
end
into
the
crown
of
the
hat
and
thus
constructed
a
sort
of
crude
parasol
wherewith
to
keep
the
sun
from
the
baby
the
worst
bad
man
nodded
his
approbation
and
bob
sangster
lowered
the
baby
until
its
soft
little
face
brushed
the
bloody
bristles
on
the
worst
bad
man
cheek
a
handclasp
and
the
last
of
the
godfathers
turned
his
young
face
toward
new
jerusalem
and
departed
into
the
eye
of
the
coming
day
the
worst
bad
man
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
into
the
neutrals
of
the
desert
before
he
turned
his
head
to
glance
back
along
the
trail
by
which
they
had
come
away
off
to
the
southwest
forty
miles
away
the
cathedral
peaks
lifted
their
castellated
spires
and
the
gaze
of
the
stricken
godfather
went
no
farther
the
cathedral
peaks
how
like
a
church
they
seemed
standing
there
in
the
solitude
sublime
indestructible
eternal
gazing
down
the
centuries
the
worst
bad
man
was
moved
to
solemn
thought
he
who
had
so
little
time
for
thought
now
his
mind
harkened
back
to
the
scene
in
the
salt
house
on
the
dry
lake
to
bill
kearny
challenge
to
the
omnipotent
to
the
answers
that
came
to
that
anguished
soul
crying
in
the
wilderness
of
doubt
and
unbelief
and
suddenly
a
great
desire
came
over
the
worst
bad
man
he
too
wanted
to
know
he
too
would
ask
a
sign
and
if
there
was
a
god
he
stretched
forth
his
arms
toward
the
cathedral
peaks
lord
give
me
a
sign
he
gobbled
let
me
have
the
light
and
as
if
in
answer
to
his
cry
the
sun
burst
over
the
crest
of
the
panimints
a
long
shaft
of
light
shot
across
the
desert
and
painted
in
colors
designed
by
the
master
artist
the
distant
spires
of
the
cathedral
peaks
they
flamed
in
crimson
in
gold
in
flashes
of
silver
light
fading
away
into
turquoise
and
deep
maroon
and
in
that
light
the
worst
bad
man
read
the
answer
to
his
riddle
lord
i
the
horrid
gobbling
broke
the
silence
once
more
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
and
then
the
desert
madness
smote
his
brain
and
with
the
sudden
terrible
strength
of
the
maniac
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
started
across
the
waste
toward
the
peaks
over
the
long
trail
to
the
great
divide
he
ran
with
arms
outstretched
and
as
he
ran
the
peaks
flamed
and
flickered
in
heliograph
flashes
perhaps
they
carried
a
message
a
message
that
only
the
worst
bad
man
could
understand
the
message
of
hope
eternal
sounding
down
the
ages
today
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
presently
the
worst
bad
man
fell
it
was
the
end
he
had
kept
the
faith
but
bob
sangster
could
not
wait
and
watch
and
speculate
time
pressed
at
terrapin
tanks
he
had
passed
his
word
and
he
must
be
moving
on
if
he
would
save
his
godson
he
had
one
can
of
condensed
milk
and
half
a
quart
of
water
left
it
behooved
him
to
hurry
when
the
sun
was
an
hour
high
and
the
desolate
landscape
lay
baking
and
shimmering
round
him
he
crept
into
the
meager
shadow
of
a
tree
undressed
the
infant
rubbed
him
with
the
last
of
the
olive
oil
and
threw
the
bottle
away
then
with
new
fresh
garments
carried
from
terrapin
tanks
he
dressed
the
baby
he
wet
his
bandana
handkerchief
and
washed
the
little
red
face
he
was
preparing
for
the
final
dash
he
abandoned
the
supply
of
bread
and
jerked
beef
the
bible
and
doctor
meecham
invaluable
work
on
caring
for
the
baby
he
considered
a
moment
and
decided
to
abandon
also
the
heavy
woolen
blanket
in
which
they
had
been
carrying
the
baby
it
six
pounds
less
weight
and
unless
they
made
new
jerusalem
before
sundown
robert
william
thomas
would
not
need
it
with
or
without
blankets
they
would
both
sleep
cold
under
the
stars
tonight
for
bob
was
once
more
confronted
by
the
primal
necessity
of
his
calling
he
had
to
take
a
he
was
about
to
discard
his
and
belt
but
a
stealthy
crackle
in
the
sagebrush
caused
him
to
reconsider
he
watched
the
spot
whence
the
sounds
came
and
presently
he
made
out
the
form
of
a
coyote
the
brute
was
sitting
on
his
hunkers
his
red
tongue
lolling
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
his
glance
fixed
in
lazy
appraisal
upon
the
last
of
the
godfathers
and
the
bundle
that
he
carried
the
boldness
of
the
beast
was
an
insult
in
itself
it
drove
bob
sangster
wild
with
anger
with
marvelous
brute
intelligence
the
coyote
had
sensed
the
weakness
of
the
man
and
patiently
he
had
set
himself
the
task
of
shadowing
him
to
the
finish
he
sat
there
now
waiting
in
his
contempt
for
the
hereditary
enemy
the
gray
skulker
did
not
even
trouble
to
conceal
his
intentions
so
you
hangin
round
for
the
pickin
already
snarled
bob
sangster
and
fired
the
coyote
turned
a
somersault
and
crawled
away
through
the
sage
dragging
its
hindlegs
after
it
and
two
more
coyotes
sprang
up
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
and
scurried
out
of
range
you
think
i
drop
this
boy
do
you
raved
the
godfather
blazing
away
at
the
fleeing
enemy
long
after
it
was
out
of
range
he
seized
robert
william
thomas
and
holding
his
hat
parasol
over
the
child
hurried
along
toward
the
mouth
of
a
draw
he
was
getting
in
among
the
low
black
volcanic
hills
and
lava
beds
again
and
the
reflected
heat
was
terrible
cautiously
he
made
his
way
along
the
shady
side
of
the
canon
and
for
an
hour
he
progressed
thus
until
the
sun
having
risen
higher
sought
him
out
horned
toads
and
lizards
scuttled
out
of
his
path
in
fright
chuckwallas
blinked
their
eyes
at
him
a
desert
terrapin
waddled
leisurely
by
and
once
gazing
back
over
the
trail
he
saw
that
the
coyotes
had
recovered
from
their
fright
and
were
following
him
again
he
commenced
to
see
mirages
wonderfully
beautiful
little
lakes
fringed
with
palms
and
rushes
distinctly
he
heard
the
pleasant
murmur
of
water
tumbling
over
rocks
he
was
tempted
to
pause
and
search
for
this
purling
brook
but
his
warned
that
it
was
all
a
delusion
of
the
heat
and
his
own
imagination
he
knew
that
the
sun
was
getting
him
fast
that
he
was
drying
up
cactus
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
as
if
in
that
one
word
he
held
the
open
sesame
of
life
just
one
niggerhead
but
the
niggerhead
cactus
with
its
scanty
supply
of
vegetable
juices
did
not
grow
in
the
country
through
which
he
was
traveling
and
as
the
slow
miles
slipped
behind
him
and
his
eager
glance
revealed
the
entire
absence
of
the
shrub
that
meant
life
to
him
and
robert
william
thomas
the
terrible
uselessness
of
his
struggle
the
horrible
forlornness
of
his
forlorn
hope
became
more
and
more
apparent
the
baby
was
whimpering
continually
now
and
faint
blue
rings
had
appeared
under
the
little
sufferer
eyes
he
was
sick
and
tired
and
hot
and
itchy
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
godfathers
had
done
their
best
bob
sangster
knew
that
the
child
could
not
last
a
day
longer
without
proper
attention
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
had
survived
thus
far
a
miracle
only
accounted
for
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
healthy
hearty
at
birth
the
last
of
the
godfathers
tried
vainly
to
soothe
him
with
the
yeller
rose
o
texas
but
he
was
beyond
singing
now
and
in
the
knowledge
that
both
were
going
swiftly
he
mingled
his
tears
with
those
of
his
godson
yet
they
were
manly
tears
and
no
taint
of
selfpity
brought
them
forth
only
it
broke
bob
sangster
heart
to
think
of
his
helpless
godson
and
of
the
gray
scavengers
skulking
behind
suddenly
the
godfather
thrilled
with
a
great
feeling
of
relief
and
joy
he
had
come
to
an
indian
water
sign
he
read
it
at
a
glance
five
little
rock
monuments
in
a
circle
with
a
sixth
standing
off
to
the
right
about
thirty
feet
from
the
others
in
that
direction
the
water
lay
and
bearing
due
southwest
bob
sangster
saw
a
draw
opening
up
the
journey
would
take
him
a
mile
or
two
out
of
his
way
but
what
mattered
a
mile
or
ten
miles
provided
he
found
water
the
prospect
gave
him
renewed
hope
and
strength
he
forged
steadily
ahead
and
when
the
canon
narrowed
he
knew
he
was
coming
to
a
up
the
wash
he
ran
and
sank
sobbing
on
the
edge
of
the
it
was
quite
dry
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
gather
his
courage
together
and
depart
down
the
canon
again
he
had
traveled
two
miles
for
nothing
he
wept
anew
at
the
thought
marveling
the
while
that
there
should
be
so
much
moisture
still
in
his
wretched
body
at
the
mouth
of
the
canon
he
halted
and
prepared
the
last
of
his
condensed
milk
and
water
for
the
baby
when
he
proffered
it
however
the
child
screamed
and
refused
the
horrid
draught
and
as
he
lay
on
the
man
knees
with
his
little
mouth
open
bob
sangster
dropped
in
the
last
dregs
of
his
canteen
you
need
water
too
son
he
mumbled
sadly
this
sweet
dope
is
killin
he
replaced
the
feeding
bottle
in
his
pocket
paused
long
enough
to
kill
another
coyote
that
had
ventured
too
close
and
resumed
his
journey
toward
new
jerusalem
he
had
left
the
dry
tank
at
noon
at
one
he
was
two
miles
nearer
new
jerusalem
at
three
he
was
within
five
miles
of
the
camp
and
had
fallen
for
the
first
time
but
even
as
he
fell
he
had
thrust
out
his
left
hand
thus
fending
his
weight
from
the
baby
and
the
child
had
not
been
injured
so
the
godfather
merely
covered
the
child
tender
head
with
tom
gibbons
old
hat
and
together
they
lay
for
a
while
prone
in
the
sand
the
man
was
not
yet
done
but
he
was
exhausted
and
half
blind
and
very
weak
he
was
striving
to
get
his
courage
in
hand
once
more
and
he
needed
a
rest
so
badly
so
he
lay
there
trying
to
think
until
presently
the
whimpering
of
the
infant
aroused
him
and
he
sat
up
suddenly
seated
in
a
circle
of
which
bob
sangster
and
the
baby
formed
the
axis
were
half
a
dozen
coyotes
they
were
closer
now
too
close
for
comfort
and
cowardly
as
he
knew
them
to
be
there
were
enough
of
them
present
to
fan
their
courage
to
the
point
where
a
single
rush
would
end
it
he
fired
at
them
and
they
scampered
away
unharmed
i
ca
shoot
any
more
the
man
wailed
i
goin
blind
come
son
we
must
move
on
or
they
get
us
he
picked
the
child
up
and
plodded
on
and
once
more
the
coyotes
fell
into
line
behind
him
the
godfather
began
to
feel
afraid
of
them
he
was
obsessed
with
a
horrible
fear
that
they
might
sneak
up
and
snap
at
him
from
behind
or
rush
him
en
masse
and
tear
the
baby
out
of
his
arms
he
kept
glancing
back
and
firing
at
them
but
all
of
his
shots
went
wild
and
gradually
the
tracing
brutes
grew
bolder
whenever
he
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
to
rest
they
surrounded
him
and
it
seemed
to
the
godfather
that
each
time
they
edged
in
closer
he
decided
to
save
his
cartridges
until
the
final
rush
he
tottered
along
until
four
before
he
fell
again
this
time
he
twisted
in
time
to
land
on
his
back
with
the
baby
uppermost
and
as
he
lay
there
stunned
and
shaken
the
godfather
was
almost
proud
of
himself
for
his
forethought
he
closed
his
eyes
to
rid
his
vision
of
the
myriads
of
red
yellow
and
blue
spots
that
came
dancing
out
of
the
sand
and
shooting
into
the
air
like
skyrockets
the
spots
still
persisted
however
for
the
skyrockets
were
in
his
brain
and
as
he
lay
there
it
came
to
him
that
this
was
to
be
the
end
after
all
he
was
too
weak
to
carry
the
baby
further
sooner
or
later
he
would
fall
upon
it
and
kill
it
so
why
struggle
further
the
baby
was
leaving
him
he
could
feel
it
being
slowly
dragged
from
his
protecting
arm
and
with
a
moan
that
was
intended
for
a
shriek
he
sat
up
and
reached
for
his
gun
so
close
to
him
was
the
coyote
dragging
gingerly
at
the
infant
clothing
that
the
godfather
dared
not
fire
he
merely
threw
up
his
arms
to
frighten
the
beast
away
and
reluctantly
it
trotted
back
and
rejoined
its
companions
of
the
slavering
circle
the
godfather
knelt
in
the
sands
beside
the
baby
and
searched
for
the
marks
of
teeth
but
found
none
the
horror
of
their
situation
was
brought
forcefully
home
to
him
now
he
had
hoped
before
but
hope
was
vanished
new
jerusalem
could
not
be
more
than
three
miles
away
but
it
might
as
well
be
three
hundred
for
bob
sangster
could
never
make
it
with
the
baby
he
thought
no
longer
of
life
he
wanted
to
cheat
the
coyotes
and
in
his
agony
he
forgot
that
he
was
a
bad
man
and
cried
aloud
to
a
supreme
being
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
o
god
save
me
save
me
not
for
myself
but
for
this
poor
little
baby
i
old
and
tough
lord
but
save
the
baby
you
were
a
baby
yourself
once
lord
if
the
bible
do
lie
now
save
my
baby
do
go
back
on
me
lord
help
me
help
me
to
keep
my
word
to
raise
him
right
he
clasped
the
child
in
his
arms
and
kissed
it
passionately
for
the
first
time
since
his
assumption
of
the
duties
of
a
godfather
and
then
because
he
was
a
fighter
and
could
not
quit
while
there
was
life
within
him
he
reeled
onward
with
dogged
persistence
he
fixed
his
fading
glance
on
some
unimportant
landmark
ana
nerved
himself
to
last
until
he
should
reach
it
queer
thoughts
kept
obtruding
themselves
upon
him
once
he
thought
a
chuckwalla
addressed
him
saying
hello
bob
what
are
you
runnin
away
from
you
ca
dodge
them
coyotes
goin
to
get
that
infant
sure
better
chuck
the
kid
an
see
if
you
ca
make
it
alone
to
new
jerusalem
that
baby
weight
is
killin
you
boy
after
all
what
is
he
to
you
he
only
a
baby
why
do
you
drop
him
an
beat
it
in
to
new
jerusalem
you
can
make
it
without
the
he
had
cursed
the
chuckwalla
and
stamped
it
into
the
earth
for
the
insult
but
a
moment
later
a
horned
toad
advised
him
to
drink
the
milk
that
still
remained
in
the
feeding
bottle
of
course
it
none
o
my
business
remarked
the
horned
toad
but
if
the
baby
wo
drink
it
you
should
it
foolish
to
let
it
go
to
waste
it
only
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
but
it
give
you
strength
to
make
that
black
lava
point
a
mile
horned
toad
replied
the
godfather
you
a
sensible
little
critter
an
i
take
your
advice
it
ai
manly
to
do
it
but
nothin
matters
any
he
drank
the
milk
that
the
baby
had
refused
tossed
the
bottle
aside
and
nerved
himself
to
last
until
he
should
reach
the
black
lava
point
that
was
to
be
the
last
goal
if
he
fell
before
he
reached
it
he
resolved
to
climb
into
a
tree
wedge
himself
and
the
baby
in
between
the
limbs
kill
the
baby
and
himself
and
thus
dying
have
the
laugh
on
the
coyotes
he
fell
for
the
third
time
the
child
escaped
being
crushed
the
tree
was
only
fifty
yards
away
the
black
lava
point
yards
but
when
the
godfather
could
scramble
to
his
feet
again
he
made
for
the
tree
here
to
his
disgust
he
found
himself
too
weak
to
climb
the
tree
so
he
leaned
against
it
and
wept
with
rage
and
horror
and
disappointment
the
horned
toad
had
followed
and
now
offered
more
advice
sangster
you
a
chump
why
climb
the
tree
the
buzzards
will
get
you
so
what
the
difference
i
make
the
lava
point
replied
the
godfather
they
ca
come
at
me
in
back
there
an
i
can
keep
away
for
a
while
he
lurched
away
foot
by
foot
he
approached
the
black
lava
point
he
resolved
to
round
it
there
was
shade
on
the
other
side
staggering
reeling
muttering
incoherently
he
rounded
the
lava
rock
and
collided
with
something
soft
and
hairy
he
leaned
against
it
for
a
moment
resting
while
something
soft
and
warm
and
animallike
nuzzled
him
and
nickered
softly
in
the
joy
of
the
meeting
when
bob
sangster
opened
his
eyes
he
found
himself
leaning
against
a
trembling
old
white
burro
with
a
pack
on
his
back
water
thought
the
godfather
water
there
ought
to
be
a
canvas
waterbag
and
he
went
clawing
along
the
burro
side
feeling
for
the
waterbag
but
unable
to
find
it
the
little
animal
was
standing
patiently
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
and
bob
sangster
stood
off
and
looked
at
him
the
burro
eyes
were
red
and
evidently
he
had
traveled
far
his
legs
trembled
his
tongue
dry
and
black
protruded
from
his
mouth
the
burro
too
was
dying
of
thirst
you
poor
devil
mused
bob
sangster
he
gazed
at
the
pitiable
little
animal
the
while
his
memory
strove
to
recall
some
other
incident
in
which
a
burro
had
figured
there
had
been
some
talk
of
burros
recently
with
bill
kearny
and
tom
gibbons
what
was
it
well
never
mind
it
did
make
any
difference
this
burro
was
dying
and
useless
there
was
no
water
bag
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
jerusalem
then
sent
jesus
two
disciples
saying
unto
them
go
into
the
village
over
against
you
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
tied
the
words
of
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
flamed
in
letters
of
fire
across
the
failing
vision
of
the
last
godfather
he
remembered
now
he
had
read
a
chapter
from
the
bible
to
bill
kearny
and
tom
gibbons
back
there
at
terrapin
tanks
and
it
was
all
about
christ
riding
into
jerusalem
on
an
ass
here
in
the
shadow
of
this
black
lava
he
had
found
a
burro
waiting
bill
kearny
had
asked
for
a
sign
the
last
of
the
godfathers
thought
of
his
frenzied
prayer
of
an
hour
before
he
had
asked
for
help
could
it
be
possible
that
here
stood
the
answer
there
a
chance
he
mumbled
this
critter
has
stampeded
from
some
prospector
pack
outfit
he
been
lookin
for
water
and
the
lord
sent
him
our
way
sonny
he
sure
sent
with
his
free
hand
the
godfather
clawed
desperately
at
the
diamond
hitch
swept
the
load
from
the
packsaddle
ripped
it
apart
and
found
a
can
of
tomatoes
he
slashed
the
can
open
drank
some
himself
and
gave
the
balance
to
the
burro
then
lifting
his
godson
into
the
packsaddle
he
lashed
him
in
securely
after
which
he
took
his
open
pocket
knife
in
hand
and
prodded
the
jaded
burro
until
it
consented
to
move
away
across
the
desert
at
a
crawling
shuffling
gait
bob
sangster
walked
beside
the
burro
one
hand
busy
with
the
point
of
the
knife
the
other
clinging
desperately
to
the
rear
cross
of
the
packsaddle
his
strength
had
in
a
measure
returned
after
drinking
the
canned
tomatoes
and
he
fancied
that
the
burro
too
seemed
rejuvenated
bob
sangster
wished
he
had
another
can
of
tomatoes
to
offer
the
little
beast
for
the
lives
of
himself
and
his
godson
depended
on
the
burro
he
leaned
heavily
against
the
animal
which
half
led
half
dragged
him
along
thus
an
hour
passed
they
were
ascending
the
upraise
that
led
to
the
crest
of
the
southeast
spur
of
old
woman
mountain
now
and
through
the
sunset
haze
the
demoniac
face
leered
down
at
them
from
the
heights
above
slowly
haltingly
they
progressed
up
the
slope
the
burro
was
almost
spent
and
time
and
again
he
balked
and
groaned
a
feeble
protest
he
welcomed
the
occasions
when
the
godfather
weak
clasp
of
the
packsaddle
was
broken
and
he
fell
headlong
to
earth
but
if
he
fell
the
godfather
rose
again
moaning
praying
raving
and
still
the
awful
cavalcade
pressed
on
the
shadows
grew
long
the
sun
disappeared
and
evening
settled
over
the
desert
but
still
the
sorry
pilgrimage
continued
up
the
slope
now
they
were
half
a
mile
from
it
a
quarter
two
hundred
yards
a
hundred
from
the
summit
the
burro
grunted
shivered
and
lay
down
in
the
gathering
gloom
bob
sangster
felt
for
the
ropes
which
bound
the
baby
to
the
pack
cut
them
and
stood
clear
of
the
dying
beast
you
pulled
me
up
the
slope
in
the
heat
old
fellow
he
tried
to
say
with
lips
that
were
split
and
parched
and
cut
and
bleeding
i
never
could
have
made
it
new
jerusalem
ca
be
far
away
now
i
get
there
but
he
pressed
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
into
the
suffering
animal
ear
and
pulled
i
owed
you
that
kindness
he
mumbled
and
passed
on
to
the
crest
of
the
slope
at
the
summit
he
paused
swaying
gently
with
his
precious
burden
and
gazed
down
the
other
side
of
the
spur
in
a
hollow
a
few
hundred
yards
below
him
the
lights
of
new
jerusalem
gleamed
brightly
through
the
gathering
gloom
of
that
lonely
christmas
eve
and
the
godfather
recalled
the
words
of
bill
kearny
it
a
christmas
baby
god
wo
go
back
on
bob
sangster
tongue
hung
from
his
mouth
long
and
black
and
withered
like
the
tongue
of
a
dead
beef
as
he
stood
there
on
the
outskirts
of
new
jerusalem
and
thought
of
many
things
bill
kearny
had
been
right
it
was
a
christmas
baby
it
would
pull
through
all
right
he
drew
the
baby
to
him
until
their
faces
were
very
close
so
close
that
a
little
hand
crept
up
and
closed
tightly
over
the
godfather
nose
this
was
to
be
their
last
supreme
moment
together
for
after
tonight
some
woman
must
enter
into
robert
william
thomas
life
and
bob
sangster
could
only
be
a
partner
in
his
godson
love
he
recalled
that
the
mother
had
told
the
worst
bad
man
they
had
kin
in
new
jerusalem
and
bob
sangster
wondered
if
she
had
intended
that

thought

him
and
his
hot
tears
fell
fast
on
the

white
face
as
he
staggered
down
the

a
battered
bleeding
raving
wreck
of
a

his
uncertain
way
