dennis
hanks
as
he
hurried
up
the
path
he
was
going
to
like
having
a
boy
cousin
they
could
go
swimming
together

they
could
play
indian
dennis
pushed
open
the
cabin
door
where
is
he
he
shouted
where
is
he
sh
a
neighbor
who
had
come
in
to
help
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
the
baby
is
asleep
nancy
lincoln
was
lying
on
the
pole
bed
in
a
corner
of
the
house
she
looked
very
white
under
the
dark
bearskin
covering
but
when
she
heard
dennis
she
raised
her
head
it
all
right
denny
she
said
you
can
see
him
now
dennis
tiptoed
over
to
the
bed
a
small
bundle
wrapped
in
a
homespun
shawl
rested
in
the
curve
of
nancy
arm
when
she
pulled
back
the
shawl
dennis
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
the
baby
was
so
wrinkled
and
so
red
it
looked
just
like
a
cherry
after
the
juice
had
been
squeezed
out
nancy
touched
one
of
the
tiny
hands
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
see
his
wee
red
fists
and
the
way
he
throws
them
around
she
said
what
his
name
dennis
asked
at
last
we
calling
him
after
his
grandpappy
abraham
lincoln
that
great
big
name
for
that
scrawny
little
mite
nancy
sounded
hurt
give
him
a
chance
to
grow
will
you
then
she
saw
that
dennis
was
only
teasing
you
wait
she
went
on
it
wo
be
long
before
abe
will
be
running
around
in
buckskin
breeches
and
a
coonskin
cap
well
maybe
the
door
opened
and
tom
lincoln
the
baby
father
came
in
with
him
was
aunt
betsy
sparrow
she
kissed
nancy
and
carried
the
baby
over
to
a
stool
by
the
fireplace
making
little
cooing
noises
under
her
breath
she
dressed
him
in
a
white
shirt
and
a
yellow
flannel
petticoat
sally
lincoln
two
years
old
who
did
not
know
quite
what
to
make
of
the
new
brother
came
over
and
stood
beside
her
dennis
drew
up
another
stool
and
watched
aunt
betsy
looked
across
at
him
and
smiled
dennis
an
orphan
lived
with
her
and
she
knew
that
he
was
often
lonely
there
were
many
people
living
in
kentucky
in
the
year
and
dennis
had
no
boys
to
play
with
i
reckon
you
mighty
tickled
to
have
a
new
cousin
she
said
i
i
guess
so
said
dennis
slowly
want
to
hold
him
dennis
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
did
or
not
before
he
could
answer
aunt
betsy
laid
the
baby
in
his
arms
sally
edged
closer
she
started
to
put
out
her
hand
but
pulled
it
back
abraham
was
so
small
that
she
was
afraid
to
touch
him
do
you
fret
sally
said
dennis
cousin
nancy
said
that
he
is
going
to
grow
and
when
he
does
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
going
to
teach
him
to
swim
illustration
looking
down
into
the
tiny
red
face
dennis
felt
a
sudden
warm
glow
in
his
heart
yes
and
we
can
go
fishing
down
at
the
creek
when
i
go
to
the
mill
to
get
the
corn
ground
he
can
come
along
he
can
ride
behind
me
on
the
horse
and
when
it
goes
dennis
swung
the
baby
back
and
forth
it
puckered
up
its
face
and
began
to
cry
dennis
caught
his
breath
in
dismay
how
could
such
a
large
noise
come
out
of
such
a
small
body
here
aunt
take
him
quick
he
looked
at
cousin
nancy
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
i
reckon
never
come
to
much
now
dennis
hanks
i
want
you
to
behave
said
aunt
betsy
but
this
time
nancy
paid
no
attention
to
his
teasing
she
held
out
her
arms
for
her
son
and
cuddled
him
against
her
breast
as
i
told
you
she
said
gaily
you
have
to
give
him
a
chance
to
grow
it
was
almost
dark
by
the
time
aunt
betsy
had
tidied
the
cabin
she
cooked
some
dried
berries
for
nancy
and
fed
sally
dennis
begged
to
spend
the
night
after
his
aunt
had
put
on
her
shawl
and
left
for
her
own
cabin
he
curled
up
in
a
bearskin
on
the
floor
denny
asked
nancy
what
day
is
this
it
sunday
i
mean
what
day
of
the
month
i
do
rightly
know
cousin
nancy
i
remember
now
she
went
on
it
is
the
twelfth
day
of
february
february
little
abe
birthday
outside
the
wind
rose
whistling
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
there
was
a
blast
of
cold
air
as
the
door
opened
tom
came
in
his
arms
piled
high
with
wood
he
knelt
on
the
dirt
floor
to
build
up
the
fire
and
the
rising
flames
lit
the
log
walls
with
a
faint
red
glow
are
you
glad
it
a
boy
tom
nancy
asked
as
he
lay
down
beside
her
i
am
yes
said
tom
but
when
she
spoke
to
him
again
he
did
not
answer
he
was
asleep
she
could
see
his
tired
face
in
the
firelight
life
had
been
hard
for
tom
it
was
hard
for
most
pioneers
she
hoped
that
their
children
would
have
things
a
little
easier
the
baby
whimpered
and
she
held
him
closer
denny
voice
piped
up
cousin
nancy
will
abe
ever
grow
to
be
as
big
as
me
you
are
now
she
told
him
will
he
grow
as
big
as
cousin
tom
anybody
maybe
nancy
looked
down
at
her
son
now
peacefully
asleep
she
made
a
song
for
him
a
song
so
soft
it
was
almost
a
whisper
abe
abe
she
crooned
abe
lincoln
you
be
going
to
grow
and
grow
and
grow
illustration
abraham
lincoln
did
grow
he
seemed
to
grow
bigger
every
day
by
the
time
he
was
seven
he
was
as
tall
as
his
sister
although
sally
was
two
years
older
that
fall
their
father
made
a
trip
up
to
indiana
why
did
pappy
go
so
far
away
sally
asked
one
afternoon
when
is
he
coming
home
asked
abe
pretty
soon
most
likely
nancy
laid
down
her
sewing
and
tried
to
explain
their
pa
had
had
a
hard
time
making
a
living
for
them
he
was
looking
for
a
better
farm
tom
was
also
a
carpenter
maybe
some
of
the
new
settlers
who
were
going
to
indiana
to
live
would
give
him
work
anyway
he
thought
that
poor
folks
were
better
off
up
there
abe
looked
surprised
he
had
never
thought
about
being
poor
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
liked
to
do
in
kentucky
he
liked
to
go
swimming
with
dennis
after
his
chores
were
done
there
were
fish
to
be
caught
and
caves
to
explore
he
and
sally
had
had
a
chance
to
go
to
school
for
a
few
weeks
abe
could
write
his
name
just
like
his
father
he
could
read
much
better
tom
knew
a
few
words
but
his
children
could
read
whole
sentences
illustration
abe
leaned
up
against
his
mother
tell
us
the
story
with
our
names
he
begged
nancy
put
her
arm
around
him
she
often
told
the
children
stories
from
the
bible
one
of
their
favorites
was
about
abraham
and
sarah
now
the
lord
said
unto
abraham
she
began
and
stopped
to
listen
the
door
opened
and
tom
lincoln
stood
grinning
down
at
them
well
folks
he
said
we
moving
to
indiany
nancy
and
the
children
taken
by
surprise
asked
questions
faster
than
tom
could
answer
them
he
had
staked
out
a
claim
about
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
at
a
place
called
pigeon
creek
he
was
buying
the
land
from
the
government
and
could
take
his
time
to
pay
for
it
he
wanted
to
start
for
indiana
at
once
before
the
weather
got
any
colder
illustration
it
did
not
take
long
to
get
ready
a
few
possessions
a
skillet
several
pans
the
water
buckets
the
fire
shovel
a
few
clothes
a
homespun
blanket
a
patchwork
quilt
and
several
bearskins
were
packed
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
horses
nancy
and
sally
rode
on
the
other
horse
abe
and
his
father
walked
at
night
they
camped
along
the
way
when
at
last
they
reached
the
ohio
river
abe
stared
in
surprise
it
was
so
blue
so
wide
so
much
bigger
than
the
creek
where
he
and
dennis
had
gone
swimming
there
were
so
many
boats
one
of
them
a
long
low
raft
was
called
a
ferry
the
lincolns
went
right
on
board
with
their
pack
horses
and
it
carried
them
across
the
shining
water
to
the
wooded
shores
of
indiana
indiana
was
a
much
wilder
place
than
kentucky
there
was
no
road
leading
to
pigeon
creek
only
a
path
through
the
forest
it
was
so
narrow
that
sometimes
tom
had
to
clear
away
some
underbrush
before
they
could
go
on
or
else
he
had
to
stop
to
cut
down
a
tree
that
stood
in
their
way
abe
who
was
big
and
strong
for
his
age
had
his
own
little
ax
he
helped
his
father
all
he
could
fourteen
miles
north
of
the
river
they
came
to
a
cleared
place
in
the
forest
tom
called
it
his
farm
he
hastily
put
up
a
shelter
a
camp
made
of
poles
and
brush
and
leaves
where
they
could
stay
until
he
had
time
to
build
a
cabin
it
had
only
three
walls
the
fourth
side
was
left
open
and
in
this
open
space
tom
built
a
fire
the
children
helped
their
mother
to
unpack
and
she
mixed
batter
for
cornbread
in
a
big
iron
skillet
she
cut
up
a
squirrel
that
tom
had
shot
earlier
in
the
day
and
cooked
it
over
the
campfire
now
if
you
will
fetch
me
your
plates
she
said
we
have
our
supper
the
plates
were
only
slabs
of
bark
on
each
slab
nancy
put
a
piece
of
fried
squirrel
and
a
hunk
of
cornbread
the
children
sank
down
on
one
of
the
bearskins
to
eat
their
first
meal
in
their
new
home
by
this
time
it
was
quite
dark
they
could
see
only
a
few
feet
beyond
the
circle
of
light
made
by
their
campfire
nancy
shivered
she
knew
that
they
had
neighbors
tom
had
told
her
there
were
seven
other
families
living
at
pigeon
creek
but
the
trees
were
so
tall
the
night
so
black
that
she
had
a
strange
feeling
that
they
were
the
only
people
alive
for
miles
around
do
you
like
it
here
mammy
abe
asked
to
him
this
camping
out
was
an
adventure
but
he
wanted
his
mother
to
like
it
too
i
just
feeling
a
little
cold
she
told
him
i
like
it
said
sally
decidedly
but
it
is
sort
of
scary
are
you
scared
abe
me
abe
stuck
out
his
chest
what
is
there
to
be
scared
of
at
that
moment
a
howl
came
from
the
forest
another
seemed
to
come
from
just
beyond
their
campfire
then
another
and
another
each
howl
louder
and
closer
the
black
curtain
of
the
night
was
pierced
by
two
green
spots
of
light
the
children
huddled
against
their
mother
but
tom
lincoln
laughed
i
reckon
i
know
what
you
scared
of
a
wolf
a
wolf
sally
shrieked
yep
see
its
green
eyes
but
it
wo
come
near
our
fire
he
got
up
and
threw
on
another
log
as
the
flames
blazed
higher
the
green
lights
disappeared
there
was
a
crashing
sound
in
the
underbrush
hear
him
running
away
cowardly
varmint
tom
sat
down
again
no
wolf
will
hurt
us
if
we
keep
our
fire
going
it
was
a
busy
winter
abe
worked
side
by
side
with
his
father
how
that
boy
can
chop
thought
nancy
as
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
ax
biting
into
wood
tree
after
tree
had
to
be
cut
down
before
crops
could
be
planted
with
the
coming
of
spring
he
helped
his
father
to
plow
the
stumpy
ground
he
learned
to
plow
a
straight
furrow
he
planted
seeds
in
the
furrows
in
the
meantime
some
of
the
neighbors
helped
tom
build
a
cabin
it
had
one
room
with
a
tiny
loft
above
the
floor
was
dirt
there
were
no
windows
the
only
door
was
a
long
hole
cut
in
one
wall
and
covered
by
a
bearskin
but
tom
had
made
a
table
and
several
stools
and
there
was
a
pole
bed
in
one
corner
nancy
was
glad
to
be
living
in
a
real
house
again
and
she
kept
it
neat
and
clean
she
was
no
longer
lonely
aunt
betsy
and
her
husband
uncle
thomas
brought
dennis
with
them
from
kentucky
to
live
in
the
shelter
near
the
lincoln
cabin
several
other
new
settlers
arrived
settlers
with
children
a
schoolmaster
andrew
crawford
decided
to
start
a
school
maybe
you
have
a
chance
to
go
abe
nancy
told
him
you
know
what
the
schoolmaster
down
in
kentucky
said
he
said
you
were
a
learner
abe
looked
up
at
her
and
smiled
he
was
going
to
like
living
in
indiana
illustration
but
sad
days
were
coming
to
pigeon
creek
there
was
a
terrible
sickness
aunt
betsy
and
uncle
thomas
died
and
dennis
came
to
live
with
the
lincolns
then
nancy
was
taken
after
she
died
her
family
felt
that
nothing
would
ever
be
the
same
again
sally
tried
to
keep
house
but
she
was
only
twelve
the
one
little
room
and
the
loft
above
looked
dirtier
and
more
and
more
gloomy
as
the
weeks
went
by
sally
found
that
cooking
for
four
people
was
not
easy
the
smoke
from
the
fireplace
got
into
her
eyes
some
days
tom
brought
home
a
rabbit
or
a
squirrel
for
her
to
fry
on
other
days
it
was
too
cold
to
go
hunting
then
there
was
only
cornbread
to
eat
and
sally
cornbread
was
very
good
it
was
hard
to
know
who
missed
nancy
more
tom
or
the
children
he
sat
around
the
cabin
looking
cross
and
glum
the
ground
was
frozen
so
very
little
work
could
be
done
on
the
farm
he
decided
when
andrew
crawford
started
his
school
that
abe
and
sally
might
as
well
go
there
was
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
and
nancy
would
have
wanted
it
for
the
first
time
since
his
mother
death
abe
seemed
to
cheer
up
every
morning
except
when
there
were
chores
to
do
at
home
he
and
sally
took
a
path
through
the
woods
to
the
log
schoolhouse
master
crawford
kept
a
blab
school
the
scholars
as
he
called
his
pupils
studied
their
lessons
out
loud
the
louder
they
shouted
the
better
he
liked
it
if
a
scholar
did
know
his
lesson
he
had
to
stand
in
the
corner
with
a
long
pointed
cap
on
his
head
this
was
called
a
dunce
cap
one
boy
who
never
had
to
wear
a
dunce
cap
was
abe
lincoln
he
was
too
smart
his
side
won
nearly
every
spelling
match
he
was
good
at
figuring
and
he
had
the
best
handwriting
of
anyone
at
school
master
crawford
taught
reading
from
the
bible
but
he
had
several
other
books
from
which
he
read
aloud
among
abe
favorite
stories
were
the
ones
about
some
wise
animals
that
talked
they
were
by
a
man
named
aesop
who
had
lived
hundreds
of
years
before
abe
even
made
up
compositions
of
his
own
he
called
them
sentences
one
day
he
found
some
of
the
boys
being
cruel
to
a
terrapin
or
turtle
he
made
them
stop
then
he
wrote
a
composition
in
which
he
said
that
animals
had
feelings
the
same
as
folks
sometimes
abe
sentences
rhymed
there
was
one
rhyme
that
the
children
thought
was
a
great
joke
abe
lincoln
his
hand
and
pen
he
will
be
good
but
god
knows
when
that
abe
lincoln
is
funny
enough
to
make
a
cat
laugh
they
said
they
always
had
a
good
time
watching
abe
during
the
class
in
manners
once
a
week
master
crawford
had
them
practice
being
ladies
and
gentlemen
one
scholar
would
pretend
to
be
a
stranger
who
had
just
arrived
in
pigeon
creek
he
would
leave
the
schoolhouse
come
back
and
knock
at
the
door
another
scholar
would
greet
the
stranger
lead
him
around
the
room
and
introduce
him
one
day
it
was
abe
turn
to
do
the
introducing
he
opened
the
door
to
find
his
best
friend
nat
grigsby
waiting
outside
nat
bowed
low
from
the
waist
abe
bowed
his
buckskin
trousers
already
too
short
slipped
up
still
farther
showing
several
inches
of
his
bare
leg
he
looked
so
solemn
that
some
of
the
girls
giggled
the
schoolmaster
frowned
and
pounded
on
his
desk
the
giggling
stopped
master
crawford
said
abe
this
here
is
grigsby
his
pa
just
moved
to
these
parts
he
figures
on
coming
to
your
school
andrew
crawford
rose
and
bowed
welcome
he
said
lincoln
introduce
grigsby
to
the
other
scholars
illustration
the
children
sat
on
two
long
benches
made
of
split
logs
abe
led
nat
down
the
length
of
the
front
bench
each
girl
rose
and
made
a
curtsy
nat
bowed
each
boy
rose
and
bowed
nat
returned
the
bow
abe
kept
saying
funny
things
under
his
breath
that
the
schoolmaster
could
not
hear
but
the
children
heard
and
they
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
out
loud
sally
sat
on
the
second
bench
lincoln
said
abe
in
a
high
falsetto
voice
this
here
be
mr
grigsby
while
she
was
making
her
curtsy
sally
cheeks
suddenly
grew
red
do
let
on
i
told
you
grigsby
abe
whispered
but
lincoln
bakes
the
worst
cornbread
of
anyone
in
pigeon
creek
sally
forgot
that
they
were
having
a
lesson
in
manners
do
you
dare
talk
about
my
cornbread
she
said
angrily
the
little
log
room
rocked
with
laughter
this
time
master
crawford
had
also
heard
abe
remark
he
walked
over
to
the
corner
where
he
kept
a
bundle
of
switches
he
picked
one
up
and
laid
it
across
his
desk
we
have
no
more
monkeyshines
he
said
severely
go
on
with
the
introducing
one
day
abe
almost
got
into
real
trouble
he
had
started
for
school
early
as
he
often
did
so
that
he
could
read
one
of
master
books
he
was
feeling
sad
as
he
walked
through
the
woods
he
seemed
to
miss
his
mother
more
each
day
when
he
went
into
the
schoolhouse
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
pair
of
deer
antlers
master
crawford
had
gone
hunting
he
had
shot
a
deer
and
nailed
the
antlers
above
the
door
what
a
wonderful
place
to
swing
thought
abe
he
leaped
up
and
caught
hold
of
the
prongs
he
began
swinging
back
and
forth
crash
one
prong
came
off
in
his
hand
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
he
hurried
to
his
seat
hoping
that
the
master
would
not
notice
but
master
crawford
was
proud
of
those
antlers
when
he
saw
what
had
happened
he
picked
up
the
switch
on
his
desk
it
made
a
swishing
sound
as
he
swung
it
back
and
forth
who
broke
my
deer
antlers
he
shouted
no
one
answered
abe
hunched
down
as
far
as
he
could
on
the
bench
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
hide
inside
his
buckskin
shirt
master
crawford
repeated
his
question
who
broke
my
deer
antlers
i
aim
to
find
out
if
i
have
to
thrash
every
scholar
in
this
school
all
of
the
children
looked
scared
abe
most
of
all
but
he
stood
up
he
marched
up
to
master
crawford
desk
and
held
out
the
broken
prong
that
he
had
been
hiding
in
his
hand
i
did
it
sir
he
said
i
did
mean
to
do
it
but
i
hung
on
the
antlers
and
they
broke
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
thought
a
broke
the
other
scholars
thought
that
abe
would
get
a
licking
instead
master
crawford
told
him
to
stay
in
after
school
they
had
a
long
talk
he
liked
abe
honesty
in
owning
up
to
what
he
had
done
he
knew
how
much
he
missed
his
mother
perhaps
he
understood
that
sometimes
a
boy
cuts
up
to
try
to
forget
how
sad
he
feels
abe
felt
sadder
than
ever
after
master
crawford
moved
away
from
pigeon
creek
then
tom
lincoln
left
one
morning
he
rode
off
on
horseback
without
telling
anyone
where
he
was
going
several
days
went
by
even
dennis
was
worried
when
tom
did
not
return
abe
did
most
of
the
chores
in
the
evening
he
practiced
his
sums
master
crawford
had
taught
him
to
do
easy
problems
in
arithmetic
and
he
did
not
want
to
forget
what
he
had
learned
he
had
no
pen
no
ink
not
even
a
piece
of
paper
he
took
a
burnt
stick
from
the
fireplace
and
worked
his
sums
on
a
flat
board
he
wished
that
he
had
a
book
to
read
instead
he
tried
to
remember
the
stories
that
the
schoolmaster
had
told
he
repeated
them
to
sally
and
dennis
as
they
huddled
close
to
the
fire
to
keep
warm
he
said
them
again
to
himself
after
he
went
to
bed
in
the
loft
there
were
words
in
some
of
the
stories
that
abe
did
not
understand
he
tried
to
figure
out
what
the
words
meant
he
thought
about
the
people
in
the
stories
he
thought
about
the
places
mentioned
and
wondered
what
they
were
like
there
were
thoughts
inside
abraham
lincoln
head
that
even
sally
did
not
know
anything
about
illustration
abe
took
another
bite
of
cornbread
and
swallowed
hard
do
you
like
it
asked
sally
anxiously
i
know
it
does
taste
like
the
cornbread
mammy
used
to
make
she
looked
around
the
room
the
furniture
was
the
same
as
their
mother
had
used
a
homemade
table
and
a
few
stools
the
same
bearskin
hung
before
the
hole
in
the
wall
that
was
their
only
door
but
nancy
had
kept
the
cabin
clean
she
had
known
how
to
build
a
fire
that
did
smoke
sally
glanced
down
at
her
faded
dress
soiled
with
soot
the
dirt
floor
felt
cold
to
her
bare
feet
her
last
pair
of
moccasins
had
worn
out
weeks
ago
i
do
mind
the
cornbread
at
least
not
much
abe
finished
his
piece
down
to
the
last
crumb
if
i
seem
down
in
the
mouth
sally
it
is
just
because
illustration
he
walked
over
to
the
fireplace
where
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
room
he
misses
nancy
said
dennis
bluntly
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
then
tom
has
been
gone
for
quite
a
spell
sally
put
her
hand
on
abe
shoulder
i
scared
do
you
reckon
something
has
happened
to
pappy
is
he
ever
coming
back
abe
stared
into
the
fire
he
was
thinking
of
the
wolves
and
panthers
loose
in
the
woods
there
were
many
dangers
for
a
man
riding
alone
over
the
rough
forest
paths
the
boy
wanted
to
say
something
to
comfort
sally
but
he
had
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
know
i
he
stopped
to
listen
few
travelers
passed
by
their
cabin
in
the
winter
but
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
a
faint
noise
in
the
distance
it
sounded
like
the
creak
of
wheels
the
noise
came
again
this
time
much
closer
a
man
voice
was
shouting
maybe
it
pappy
abe
pushed
aside
the
bearskin
and
rushed
outside
sally
and
dennis
were
right
behind
him
it
pappy
sally
cried
but
look
tom
lincoln
had
left
pigeon
creek
on
horseback
he
was
returning
in
a
wagon
drawn
by
four
horses
he
was
not
alone
a
strange
woman
sat
beside
him
holding
a
small
boy
in
her
lap
two
girls
one
about
sally
age
the
other
about
eight
stood
behind
her
the
wagon
was
piled
high
with
furniture
more
furniture
than
the
lincoln
children
had
ever
seen
whoa
there
tom
lincoln
pulled
at
the
reins
and
brought
the
wagon
to
a
stop
before
the
door
here
we
are
sarah
he
jumped
down
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
the
woman
she
was
very
neat
looking
tall
and
straight
with
neat
little
curls
showing
at
the
edge
of
her
brown
hood
she
said
tsch
tsch
when
she
saw
tom
children
she
stared
at
their
soiled
clothing
their
matted
hair
their
faces
smudged
with
soot
tsch
tsch
she
said
again
and
abe
felt
hot
all
over
in
spite
of
the
cold
wind
he
dug
the
toe
of
his
moccasin
into
the
frozen
ground
abe
sally
their
father
said
i
brought
you
a
new
mammy
this
here
is
the
widow
johnston
that
is
she
was
the
widow
johnston
he
cleared
his
throat
she
is
lincoln
now
i
been
back
to
kentucky
to
get
myself
a
wife
howdy
the
new
lincoln
was
trying
to
sound
cheerful
she
beckoned
to
the
children
in
the
wagon
they
jumped
down
and
stood
beside
her
these
here
are
my
young
ones
she
went
on
the
big
gal
is
betsy
the
other
one
is
mathilda
this
little
shaver
is
johnny
dennis
came
forward
to
be
introduced
but
he
had
eyes
only
for
betsy
she
gave
him
a
coy
look
out
of
her
eyes
tilda
smiled
shyly
at
sally
both
of
the
johnston
girls
wore
pretty
dresses
under
their
shawls
and
neat
moccasins
on
their
feet
sally
looking
down
at
her
own
soiled
dress
and
bare
toes
wished
that
she
could
run
away
and
hide
abe
said
howdy
somewhere
down
inside
his
stomach
sarah
tom
new
wife
looked
around
the
littered
yard
then
at
the
cabin
it
did
not
even
have
a
window
it
did
not
have
a
door
that
would
open
and
shut
only
a
ragged
bearskin
flapping
in
the
wind
she
had
known
tom
since
he
was
a
boy
and
had
always
liked
him
her
first
husband
johnston
had
died
some
time
before
and
when
tom
had
returned
to
kentucky
and
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
had
said
yes
he
had
told
her
that
his
children
needed
a
mother
care
and
he
was
right
poor
young
ones
she
thought
aloud
she
said
well
let
not
all
stand
out
here
and
freeze
ca
we
go
inside
and
get
warm
the
inside
of
the
cabin
seemed
almost
as
cold
as
the
outdoors
and
even
more
untidy
johnny
clung
to
his
mother
skirt
and
started
to
cry
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
kentucky
his
sisters
peered
through
the
gloom
trying
to
see
in
the
dim
light
sally
was
sure
that
they
were
looking
at
her
she
sat
down
hastily
and
tucked
her
feet
as
far
back
as
she
could
under
the
stool
abe
stood
quite
still
watching
this
strange
woman
who
had
come
without
warning
to
take
his
mother
place
she
smiled
at
him
he
did
not
smile
back
slowly
she
turned
and
looked
around
her
clear
gray
eyes
took
in
every
nook
every
crack
of
the
miserable
little
house
she
noticed
the
dirty
bearskins
piled
on
the
pole
bed
in
the
corner
she
saw
the
pegs
in
the
wall
that
led
to
the
loft
the
fire
smoldering
in
the
fireplace
gave
out
more
smoke
than
heat
the
first
thing
we
better
do
she
said
taking
off
her
bonnet
is
to
build
up
that
fire
then
we
get
some
victuals
ready
i
reckon
everybody
will
feel
better
when
we
had
a
bite
to
eat
from
that
moment
things
began
to
happen
in
the
lincoln
cabin
tom
went
out
to
the
wagon
to
unhitch
the
horses
dennis
brought
in
more
firewood
abe
and
mathilda
started
for
the
spring
swinging
the
water
pail
between
them
betsy
mixed
a
fresh
batch
of
cornbread
in
the
iron
skillet
and
sally
set
it
on
the
hearth
to
bake
tom
came
back
from
the
wagon
carrying
a
comb
of
honey
and
a
slab
of
bacon
and
soon
the
magic
smell
of
frying
bacon
filled
the
air
there
were
no
dishes
but
sally
kept
large
pieces
of
bark
in
the
cupboard
eight
people
sat
down
at
the
one
little
table
but
no
one
seemed
to
mind
that
it
was
crowded
the
lincoln
children
had
almost
forgotten
how
good
bacon
could
taste
abe
ate
in
silence
his
eyes
on
his
plate
sally
seemed
to
feel
much
better
sitting
between
her
stepsisters
she
was
soon
chattering
with
them
as
though
they
were
old
friends
once
she
called
the
new
lincoln
mamma
just
as
her
own
daughters
did
dennis
sat
on
the
other
side
of
betsy
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
most
of
all
he
sopped
up
his
last
drop
of
golden
honey
on
his
last
piece
of
cornbread
illustration
i
declare
he
said
grinning
we
ai
had
a
meal
like
this
since
nancy
died
abe
jumped
up
at
the
mention
of
his
mother
name
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
cry
he
had
started
for
the
door
when
he
felt
his
rough
hand
on
his
shoulder
abe
lincoln
you
set
right
down
there
and
finish
your
cornbread
abe
looked
up
at
tom
out
of
frightened
gray
eyes
but
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
a
nice
way
to
treat
your
new
ma
tom
lincoln
sounded
both
angry
and
embarrassed
you
clean
up
your
plate
or
i
give
you
a
good
hiding
the
young
johnstons
gasped
abe
could
hear
sally
whisper
please
abe
do
as
pa
says
then
he
heard
another
voice
let
the
boy
be
tom
it
was
sarah
lincoln
speaking
there
was
something
about
the
way
she
said
it
that
made
abe
decide
to
come
back
and
sit
down
he
managed
somehow
to
eat
the
rest
of
his
cornbread
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
she
was
smiling
at
him
again
he
almost
smiled
back
sarah
looked
relieved
abe
and
i
she
said
are
going
to
have
plenty
of
chance
to
get
acquainted
illustration
sarah
rose
from
the
table
there
a
lot
of
work
to
be
done
here
she
announced
before
we
can
bring
in
my
plunder
she
meant
her
furniture
and
other
possessions
in
the
wagon
first
we
need
plenty
of
hot
water
who
wants
to
go
to
the
spring
she
was
looking
at
abe
i
go
he
grabbed
the
water
bucket
and
hurried
through
the
door
abe
made
several
trips
to
the
spring
that
afternoon
each
bucket
full
of
water
that
he
brought
back
was
poured
into
the
big
iron
kettle
over
the
fireplace
higher
and
higher
roared
the
flames
when
sarah
was
asking
for
more
water
she
was
asking
for
more
wood
the
steady
of
tom
ax
could
be
heard
from
the
wood
lot
everyone
was
working
even
dennis
sarah
gave
him
a
pan
of
soap
and
hot
water
and
told
him
to
wash
the
cabin
walls
the
girls
scrubbed
the
table
the
stools
and
the
corner
cupboard
inside
and
out
sarah
climbed
the
peg
ladder
to
peer
into
the
loft
tsch
tsch
she
said
when
she
saw
the
corn
husks
and
dirty
bearskins
on
which
the
boys
had
been
sleeping
take
them
out
and
burn
them
tom
burn
them
he
protested
yes
and
burn
the
covers
on
the
downstairs
bed
too
i
reckon
i
have
enough
feather
beds
and
blankets
to
go
around
we
starting
fresh
in
this
house
we
soon
have
it
looking
like
a
different
place
not
since
nancy
died
had
the
cabin
had
such
a
thorough
cleaning
then
came
the
most
remarkable
part
of
that
remarkable
afternoon
the
unloading
of
the
wagon
sarah
pots
and
pans
shone
from
much
scouring
her
wooden
platters
and
dishes
were
spotless
and
the
furniture
she
had
chairs
with
real
backs
a
table
and
a
big
chest
filled
with
clothes
there
was
one
bureau
that
had
cost
dollars
abe
ran
his
finger
over
the
shining
dark
wood
sarah
hung
a
small
mirror
above
it
and
he
gasped
when
he
looked
at
his
reflection
this
was
the
first
looking
glass
that
he
had
ever
seen
most
remarkable
of
all
were
the
feather
beds
one
was
laid
on
the
pole
bed
downstairs
another
was
placed
on
a
clean
bearskin
in
the
opposite
corner
to
provide
a
sleeping
place
for
the
girls
the
third
was
carried
to
the
loft
for
the
three
boys
when
abe
went
to
bed
that
night
he
sank
down
gratefully
into
the
comfortable
feathers
the
homespun
blanket
that
covered
him
was
soft
and
warm
on
either
side
dennis
and
johnny
were
asleep
abe
lay
between
them
wide
awake
staring
into
the
darkness
the
new
lincoln
was
good
and
kind
he
knew
that
she
had
seemed
pleased
when
sally
called
her
mamma
somehow
he
could
there
was
still
a
lonesome
place
in
his
heart
for
his
own
mother
something
else
was
worrying
him
before
going
to
bed
sarah
lincoln
had
looked
at
him
and
sally
out
of
her
calm
gray
eyes
tomorrow
i
aim
to
make
you
young
ones
look
more
human
she
said
abe
wondered
what
she
meant
he
found
out
the
next
morning
tom
and
dennis
left
early
to
go
hunting
abe
went
out
to
chop
wood
for
the
fireplace
when
he
came
back
he
met
the
three
girls
going
down
the
path
sally
was
walking
between
her
two
stepsisters
but
what
a
different
sally
she
wore
a
neat
pretty
dress
that
had
belonged
to
betsy
she
had
on
sarah
shawl
her
hair
was
combed
in
two
neat
pigtails
her
face
had
a
clean
scrubbed
look
her
eyes
were
sparkling
she
was
taking
betsy
and
mathilda
to
call
on
one
of
the
neighbors
mamma
she
called
sarah
stood
in
the
doorway
waving
to
the
girls
then
she
saw
abe
his
arms
piled
high
with
wood
come
in
she
said
sally

terrified
i
do
aim
to
pluck
your
feathers
without

new

sarah
laughed
i
sat
up
late
last
night
cutting
down
a
pair
of
johnston
old
pants
i
got
a
shirt
too
laid
out
here
on
the
bed
slowly
abe
started
taking
off
his
shirt
he
looked
fearfully
at
the
tub
of
hot
water
there
no
call
to
be
scared
said
sarah
that
tub
wo

down
to
the
spring

the
time

all
over
abe
stuck
one
toe
into
the
water
he
said
ouch
and
drew
it
out
he
then
tried
again
and
put
in
his
whole
foot
he
put
in
his
other
foot
he
sat
down
in
the
tub
by
the
time
sarah
returned
he
was
standing
before
the
fire
dressed
in
the
trousers
and
shirt
of
the
late
johnston
sarah
seemed
pleased
you
look
like
a
different
boy
she
said
those
trousers
are
a
mite
too
big
but
you
soon
grow
into
them
abe
was
surprised
how
good
it
felt
to
be
clean
again
thank
you

i

in
some
more
wood

plenty
of
wood
said
sarah
you
see
that
stool
you
sit
down
and
let
me
get
at
your
hair
it
looks
like
a
heap
of
underbrush
abe
watched
anxiously
when
she
opened
the
top
drawer
of
the
bureau
and
took
out
a
haw
comb
and
a
pair
of
scissors
i
stand
for
it
this
time
he
thought
because
she
been
so
good
to
us
but
if
she
pulls
too
hard
lincoln
pull
but
when
abe
said
ouch
she
patted
his
shoulder
and
waited
a
moment
he
closed
his
eyes
and
screwed
up
his
face
but
he
said
nothing
more
perhaps
she
could
help
pulling
he
decided
lock
after
lock
she
snipped
off
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
was
going
to
have
any
hair
left
by
the
time
she
got
through
i
been
watching
you
abe
you

abe
looked
at
her
amazed
you
have
sarah
nodded
but
said
nothing
more
until
she
had
finished
cutting
his
hair
then
she
led
him
over
to
the
bureau
now
see
if
you
do
like
yourself
better
without
that
brush
heap
on
top
of
your
head
she
asked
him
a
boy
with
short
neat
hair
gazed
back
at
abe
from
the
mirror
i
still
ai
the
prettiest
boy
in
pigeon
creek
he
drawled
but
there
ai
quite
so
much
left
to
be
ugly
i
right
glad
you
cleared
away
the
brush
heap
was
he
joking
he
looked
so
solemn
that
sarah
could
not
be
sure
then
he
grinned
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
seen
him
smile
you
a
caution
abe
she
said
now

yourself
down
over
there
at
the
table
and
i
show
you
my
books
she
opened
the
top
drawer
of
the
bureau
and
took
out
four
worn
little
volumes
although
she
could
not
read
she
knew
the
titles
here
they
are
the
and
oh
this
book
by
aesop
is
one
the
schoolmaster
had
the
stories
are
all
about
some
smart
talking
animals
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
as
he
bent
his
neat
shorn
head
down
over
the
pages
he
chuckled
when
he
read
something
that
amused
him
sarah
watched
him
curiously
he
was
not
like
her
john
he
was
not
like
any
boy
that
she
had
ever
known
but
the
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
went
straight
to
her
heart
illustration
he
looked
up
at
her
shyly
he
said
will
you
let
me
read
these
books
sometimes
why
abe
you
can
read
them
any
time

like
i
giving
them

a
feeling
that
nancy
his
own
mother
had
never
gone

many
changes
were
taking
place
in
the
lincoln
cabin
sarah
persuaded
tom
to
cut
two
holes
in
the
walls
for
windows
and
she
covered
them
with
greased
paper
to
let
in
the
light
he
made
a
wooden
door
that
could
be
shut
against
the
cold
winter
winds
abe
and
dennis
gave
the
walls
and
low
ceiling
a
coat
of
whitewash
and
sarah
spread
her
bright
rag
rugs
on
the
new
wooden
floor
aunt
sairy
dennis
told
her
you
some
punkins
one
just
naturally
has
to
be
somebody
when
you
around
abe
smiled
up
at
her
shyly
it
is
sort
of
like
the
magic
in
that
story
of
sinbad
you
gave
me
the
other
children
were
asleep
abe
sprawled
on
the
floor
making
marks
on
a
wooden
shovel
with
a
pointed
stick
tom
seated
in
one
of
his
wife
chairs
was
dozing
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
sarah
put
down
her
knitting
and
looked
around
the
cabin
the
place
does
look
right
cozy
she
replied
what
is
that
you
doing
abe
working
my
sums
tom
opened
his
eyes
you
know
how
to
figure
enough
already
put
that
shovel
up
and
go
to
bed
abe
took
a
knife
and
scraped
the
figures
from
the
wooden
shovel
he
placed
it
against
one
side
of
the
fireplace
good
night
mamma
he
said
good
night
abe
sarah
eyes
were
troubled
she
waited
until
dennis
had
joined
abe
in
the
loft
then
turned
to
her
husband
i
been
meaning
to
tell
you
tom
what
a
good
pa

to
my
young
ones
she
saw
that
he
was
pleased
i
tried
to
be
a
good
mother
to
abe
and
sally
too
she
went
on
you
have
been
sairy
they
took
to
you
right

i
right
glad
but
there
something
else
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
tom
he
was
nodding
again
in
his
chair
and
she
paused
to
make
sure
that
he
was
listening
abe
a
smart
boy
i
told
him
the
next
time
a
school
keeps
in
these
parts
i
ask
you
to
let
him
and
the
other
children
go
humph
tom
grunted
there
ai
any
school
for
him
to
go
to
anyway
he
wastes
enough
time
as
is
he
always
got
his
nose
buried
in
those
books
you
brought
that
bothers
me
too
i
saw
you
cuff
him
the
other
day
because
he
was
reading
i
had
to
sairy
i
told
him
to
come
out
and
chop
some
wood
but
he
up
and
laughed
in
my
face
he
was
laughing
at
you
tom
he
was
laughing
at
sinbad
who
in
tarnation
is
sinbad
a
fellow
in
one
of
his
books
abe
said
that
sinbad
sailed
his
flatboat
up
to
a
rock
and
the
rock
was
magnetized
and
pulled
all
the
nails
out
of
his
boat
then
sinbad
fell
into
the
water
that
what
i
mean
tom
exploded
dennis
told
him
that
book
was
most
likely
lies
but
abe
keeps
on
reading
it
where
is
all
this
book
learning
going
to
get
him
i
ever
had
maybe
the
lord
meant
for
young
ones
to
be
smarter
than
their
parents
said
sarah
or
the
world
might
never
get
any
better
tom
shook
his
head
in
dismay
women
and
their
fool
notions
if
i
watch
out
you
be
spoiling
the
boy
his
own
mammy
did
sarah
cheeks
were
red
as
she
bent
over
her
knitting
tom
was
right
about
one
thing
there
was
no
school
for
abe
to
go
to
but
some
day
there
would
be
every
few
weeks
another
clearing
was
made
in
the
forest
and
the
neighbors
gathered
for
a
house
raising
to
help
put
up
a
cabin
then
smoke
would
rise
from
a
new
chimney
and
another
new
home
would
be
started
in
the
wilderness
with
so
many
new
settlers
there
was
usually
plenty
of
work
for
abe
whenever
tom
did
not
need
him
at
home
he
hired
out
at
cents
a
day
he
gave
this
money
to
his
father
that
was
the
law
tom
said
not
until
abe
was
would
he
be
allowed
to
keep
his
wages
for
himself
as
a
hired
boy
he
plowed
corn
chopped
wood
and
did
all
kinds
of
chores
he
did
not
like
farming
but
he
managed
to
have
fun
pa
taught
me
to
work
abe
told
one
farmer
who
had
hired
him
but
he
never
taught
me
to
love
it
the
farmer
scratched
his
head
he
could
understand
a
boy
who
was
always
reading
and
if
abe
was
reading
he
was
telling
jokes
the
farmer
thought
that
abe
was
lazy
sometimes
the
farmer
said
i
get
awful
mad
at
you
abe
lincoln
you
crack
your
jokes
and
spin
your
yarns
if
you
want
to
while
the
men
are
eating
their
dinner
but
do
you
keep
them
from
working
the
other
farm
hands
liked
to
gather
around
abe
when
they
stopped
to
eat
their
noon
meal
sometimes
he
would
stand
on
a
tree
stump
and
speechify
the
men
would
become
so
interested
that
they
would
be
late
getting
back
to
the
fields
other
times
he
would
tell
them
stories
that
he
had
read
in
books
or
that
he
had
heard
from
some
traveler
who
had
passed
through
pigeon
creek
he
nearly
always
had
a
funny
story
to
tell
illustration
yet
there
was
something
peculiarsome
about
abe
as
dennis
hanks
once
said
he
would
be
laughing
one
minute
the
next
minute
he
would
look
solemn
and
sad
he
would
walk
along
the
narrow
forest
trails
a
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
someone
would
say
howdy
abe
then
he
would
grin
and
start
cracking
jokes
again
although
he
worked
such
long
hours
abe
still
found
time
to
read
he
sat
up
late
and
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
sarah
made
the
children
keep
quiet
when
he
wanted
to
study
sometimes
he
took
a
book
to
work
with
him
instead
of
talking
to
the
other
farm
hands
at
noon
he
go
off
by
himself
and
read
a
few
pages
while
he
ate
his
dinner
people
for
miles
around
loaned
him
books
sometimes
he
walked
fifteen
miles
to
rockport
the
county
seat
to
borrow
books
from
john
pitcher
the
town
lawyer
everything
i
want
to
know
is
in
books
he
told
dennis
my
best
friend
is
a
man
who
can
give
me
a
book
i
ai
read
late
one
afternoon
about
two
years
after
sarah
had
arrived
abe
came
home
with
a
new
book
under
his
arm
tom
and
dennis
had
joined
several
of
their
neighbors
in
a
big
bear
hunt
and
planned
to
be
gone
for
several
days
abe
planned
to
read
and
read
and
read
what
do
you
think
mamma
he
asked
i
have
a
chance
to
read
the
declaration
of
independence
sarah
smiled
into
his
eager
eyes
now
is
that
nice
he
showed
her
the
book
it
belonged
to
david
turnham
the
constable
turnham
had
said
that
abe
might
borrow
it
for
several
days
if
he
promised
to
be
careful
what
is
it
about
sarah
asked
it
has
the
laws
of
indiana
in
it
and
it
tells
how
the
government
of
our
country
was
started
abe
voice
took
on
a
new
tone
of
excitement
it
has
the
declaration
of
independence
in
it
and
the
constitution
too
he
pulled
a
stool
up
to
the
fire
and
began
to
read
there
was
no
sound
in
the
little
cabin
except
the
steady
of
sarah
knitting
needles
she
glanced
at
him
now
and
then
this
tall
awkward
boy
had
become
very
dear
to
her
as
dear
as
her
own
children
perhaps
even
dearer
but
he
was
harder
to
understand
no
matter
how
much
he
learned
he
wanted
to
learn
more
he
was
always
hungry
hungry
for
knowledge
not
hungry
for
bacon
and
cornbread
the
way
johnny
was
the
idea
made
her
chuckle
abe
did
not
hear
he
laid
the
book
on
his
knee
and
stared
into
the
flames
his
lips
were
moving
although
he
made
no
sound
what
are
you
saying
to
yourself
sarah
asked
you
look
so
far
away
why
mamma
abe
looked
up
with
a
start
i
was
just
recollecting
some
of
the
words
out
of
the
declaration
of
independence
it
says
all
men
are
created
equal
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
sarah
was
pleased
because
abe
was
i
going
to
learn
as
much
of
the
declaration
as
i
can
by
heart
before
i
take
the
book
back
he
said
that
way
i
can
always
keep
the
words
i
declare
said
sarah
you
grow
new
ideas
inside
your
head
as
fast
as
you
add
inches
on
top
of
it
illustration
abe
went
right
on
adding
inches
by
the
time
he
was
fourteen
he
was
as
tall
as
his
father
sally
was
working
as
a
hired
girl
that
summer
for
and
josiah
crawford
abe
worked
for
them
off
and
on
one
afternoon
he
finished
his
chores
early
and
crawford
sent
him
home
abe
was
glad
josiah
had
lent
him
a
new
book
a
life
of
george
washington
and
he
wanted
to
start
reading
it
when
he
reached
the
lincoln
cabin
he
found
betsy
and
mathilda
waiting
outside
for
their
mother
she
stood
before
the
mirror
in
the
cabin
putting
on
her
sunbonnet
your
pa
and
dennis
have
gone
squirrel
hunting
she
said
as
she
tied
the
strings
in
a
neat
bow
beneath
her
chin
the
gals
and
i
are
going
to
visit
a
new
neighbor
will
you
keep
an
eye
on
johnny
and
put
some
on
to
boil
for
supper
oh
ma

will
be
right
tasty
with
a
mess
of
squirrel
before
you
put
the
on
abe
patted
the
book
inside
his
shirt
front
i
can
read
he
asked
you
can
after
you
go
down
to
the
horse
trough
and
wash
your
head
wash
my
head
how
come
abe
wailed
take
a
look
at
that
ceiling
and
you
know
how
come
see
that
dark
spot
your
head
made
that
you
getting
so
tall
you
bump
into
the
ceiling
every
time
you
climb
into
the
loft
abe
rolled
his
eyes
upward
if
some
of
that
learning
i
got
cooped
up
in
my
head
starts
leaking
out
how
can
i
help
it
sarah
refused
to
be
put
off
by
any
of
his
foolishness
when
you
track
dirt
into
the
house
i
can
wash
the
floor
she
said
but
i
ca
get
to
the
ceiling
so
easy
it
needs
a
new
coat
of
whitewash
but
there
no
use
in
doing
it
if
your
head
ai
clean
all
right
said
abe
meekly
take
a
gourdful
of
soap
with
you
said
sarah
and
mind
you
no
reading
until
you
finish
washing
your
hair
he
grumbled
under
his
breath
as
he
walked
down
to
the
horse
trough
with
a
new
book
waiting
to
be
read
washing
his
hair
seemed
a
waste
of
time
but
if
that
was
what
sarah
wanted
he
would
do
it
he
lathered
his
head
with
soap
and
ducked
it
into
the
water
some
of
the
soap
got
into
his
eyes
and
he
began
to
sputter
he
heard
a
giggle
hey
johnny
is
that
you
he
said
get
a
bucket
of
water
quick
johnny
the
stepbrother
was
glad
to
oblige
he
poured
bucket
after
bucket
of
water
over
abe
head
finally
all
of
the
soap
was
rinsed
out
of
his
hair
abe
took
the
tail
of
his
shirt
and
wiped
the
soap
out
of
his
eyes
both
boys
were
covered
with
water
the
ground
around
the
horse
trough
was
like
a
muddy
little
swamp
johnny
was
delighted
he
liked
to
feel
the
mud
squish
up
between
his
toes
illustration
look
at
me
abe
he
shouted
ai
we
having
fun
abe
took
his
young
stepbrother
by
the
hand
his
eyes
were
twinkling
i
thought
of
something
else
that
fun
come
on
we
going
to
play
a
joke
on
mamma
when
sarah
returned
to
the
cabin
late
that
afternoon
she
noticed
that
abe
hair
was
still
damp
he
was
very
quiet
as
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
and
swung
the
big
kettle
outward
he
dipped
out
the
potatoes
with
an
iron
spoon
tom
and
dennis
came
in
both
somewhat
grumpy
they
had
not
brought
back
a
single
squirrel
only
johnny
seemed
in
good
spirits
he
whispered
in
mathilda
ear
they
both
began
to
giggle
by
the
time
the
family
had
gathered
around
the
table
betsy
and
dennis
had
been
let
in
on
the
secret
whatever
it
was
they
were
red
in
the
face
from
trying
not
to
laugh
quiet
said
tom
quiet
while
i
say
the
blessing
we
thank
thee
lord
he
began
tom
usually
gave
thanks
for
each
kind
of
food
on
the
table
but
today
there
was
only
a
dish
of
potatoes
we
thank
thee
lord
he
went
on
for
all
these
blessings
mighty
poor
blessings
said
abe
the
girls
giggled
again
dennis
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
johnny
was
laughing
so
hard
that
he
fell
off
his
stool
he
lay
on
the
floor
rolling
and
shrieking
i
wish
you
young
ones
would
stop
carrying
on
said
sarah
and
tell
me
what
you
carrying
on
about
illustration
oh
mamma
ca
you
see
said
betsy
look
up
sarah
gasped
marching
across
the
cabin
ceiling
were
the
muddy
marks
of
two
bare
feet
do
they
look
like
johnny
feet
mathilda
asked
johnny
johnston
you
come
right
here
said
sarah
sternly
johnny
picked
himself
up
from
the
rag
rug
before
the
fireplace
he
went
over
and
stood
before
his
mother
his
blue
eyes
danced
this
was
one
scolding
that
he
looked
forward
to
now
tell
me
the
truth
what
do
you
mean
by
sarah
paused
she
could
hardly
scold
her
son
for
walking
on
the
ceiling
johnny
had
been
told
exactly
what
to
say
i
got
my
feet
all
muddy
down
at
the
horse
trough
he
explained
then
i
walked
on
the
ceiling
you
walked
on
the
ceiling
johnny
johnston
you
know
it
wicked
to
lie
i
not
lying
those
are
my
footprints
sarah
looked
again
the
footprints
were
too
small
to
belong
to
anyone
but
johnny
she
looked
at
abe
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
sudden
liking
for
boiled
potatoes
and
kept
his
eyes
on
his
plate
abe
lincoln
is
this
some
of
your
tomfoolery
i
i
reckon
so
but
how
it
was
easy
johnny
interrupted
i
held
my
legs
stiff
and
abe
held
me
upside
down
and
i
walked
abe
stood
up
pushing
back
his
stool
he
glanced
toward
the
door
sarah
was
not
often
angry
when
she
was
she
reminded
her
children
of
a
mother
hen
ruffling
its
feathers
well
abe
have
you
got
anything
to
say
for
yourself
abe
shook
his
head
suddenly
his
joke
did
not
seem
quite
so
funny
i
declare
said
sarah
a
big
boy
like
you
you
ought
to
be
spanked
the
children
looked
at
tall
lanky
abe
towering
over
their
mother
they
burst
out
laughing
again
mamma
going
to
spank
abe
they
chanted
mamma
going
to
spank
abe
dennis
brought
both
hands
down
on
the
table
with
a
loud
whack
that
a
good
one
that
is
he
roared
sarah
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
the
children
watched
the
peculiar
way
the
apron
began
to
shake
when
she
took
it
down
they
saw
that
she
was
laughing
she
was
laughing
so
hard
that
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
i
reckon
i
have
to
let
you
off
abe
she
said
you
be
a
mite
too
big
for
me
to
handle
tom
jumped
up
he
ai
too
big
for
me
he
ai
too
big
for
a
hickory
switch
sarah
bit
her
lip
her
own
brief
anger
forgotten
now
tom
she
protested
you

going
to
talk
me
out
of
it
this
time
i
i
was
aiming
to
whitewash
the
ceiling
pa

abe

sarah
looked
relieved
that
is
exactly
what
he
can
do

ceiling
he
can
after
i
given
him
a
licking
sarah
put
out
her
hand

walls
too
that

sarah
pulled
down
her
mouth
trying
to
look
stern
tom
sat
down
and
started
to
eat
his
potato
you
a
good
one
sairy
he
chuckled
you
sure
know
how
to
get
work
out
of
him
abe
looked
at
her
gratefully
at
the
same
time
he
was
disappointed
he
had
been
thinking
about
that
book
all
afternoon
the
next
morning
sarah
shooed
everyone
out
of
the
cabin
abe
was
down
by
the
horse
trough
mixing
the
whitewash
in
a
big
tub
by
the
time
he
returned
she
had
a
bucket
of
hot
water
and
a
gourdful
of
soft
soap
ready
after
washing
the
inside
of
the
cabin
he
got
busy
with
the
whitewash
first
he
did
the
walls
then
he
did
the
rafters
and
the
ceiling
he
cocked
his
head
gazing
at
the
muddy
footprints
they
make
a
right
pretty
picture
shall
i
leave
them
on
for
decoration
sarah
seated
on
a
stool
by
the
fireplace
looked
up
from
her
sewing
abe

big
scamp

get
that
ceiling
nice
and
white
or
i
be
carrying
out
my
threat
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
twitching
abe
grinned
glad
to
be
at
peace
with
her
again
after
i
finish
here
he
asked
do
you
have
any
more
chores

abe
i
reckon
there
will
be
time
for
you
to
do
some
reading
but
first

your
whitewashing
then
there
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
abe
dipped
his
brush
into
the
whitewash
again
and
again
until
he
had
covered
up
the
last
telltale
mark
of
johnny
feet
the
cabin
was
bright
and
shining
when
he
finished
he
pulled
another
stool
up
to
the
fireplace
and
sat
facing
sarah
i
was
meaning
to
tell
you
just
yet
she
said
leastways
until
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
your
what
is
it
mamma
there

new
neighbor
come
to
pigeon
creek
she
said
man

the
name
of
james
swaney
he
is
farming
now
but
he
is
fixing
to
keep
a
school
next
winter
abe
jumped
up
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
do
you
reckon
that
pa
your
pa
is
worried
sarah
interrupted
he
may
have
to
sell
some
of
his
land
that
why
he
gets
riled
so
easy
like
yesterday
abe
flushed
i
want
you
to
be
careful
said
sarah
try
not
to
get
his
dander
up
i
try
not
to
maybe
you
recollect
what
i
promised
you
when
i
first
came
i
said
ask
your
pa
to
let
you
go
to
school
again
now
i
a
body
that
believes
in
keeping
my
promises
i
just
want
to
wait
till
he
feels
good
sarah
sewing
basket
spilled
to
the
floor
as
abe
pulled
her
to
her
feet
he
put
his
long
arms
around
her
waist
and
gave
her
a
good
bear
hug
abe
lincoln
you
most
choking
me
she
said
breathlessly
here
i
was
thinking
how
grown
up
you
were
getting
to
be
now
you
be
acting
like
a
young
one
again
abe
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
illustration
abe
sat
up
late
holding
his
book
close
to
the
flickering
flames
in
the
fireplace
as
the
rain
drummed
on
the
roof
his
thoughts
were
far
away
he
was
with
general
washington
in
a
small
boat
crossing
the
delaware
river
on
a
cold
christmas
night
many
years
before
he
was
fighting
the
battle
of
trenton
with
a
handful
of
brave
american
soldiers
they
must
have
wanted
very
much
to
be
free
he
decided
to
be
willing
to
fight
so
hard
and
suffer
so
much
is
it
getting
too
dark
for
you
to
see
sarah
called
sleepily
yes
mamma
carefully
abe
placed
the
precious
little
volume
between
two
logs
in
the
wall
of
the
cabin
this
was
his
bookcase
as
he
climbed
into
the
loft
he
wondered
if
the
book
told
about
the
time
george
washington
became
president
he
would
have
to
wait
until
morning
to
find
out
he
was
up
early
but
his
face
grew
pale
when
he
reached
for
the
book
during
the
night
the
rain
had
leaked
in
on
it
through
a
crack
in
the
logs
the
pages
were
wet
and
stuck
together
the
binding
was
warped
sally
was
starting
down
the
path
toward
the
crawford
cabin
when
abe
called
after
her
wait
i
coming
with
you
he
thrust
the
book
inside
his
buckskin
shirt
sally
tried
to
comfort
him
but
abe
kept
wondering
what
crawford
was
going
to
say
he
was
a
little
scared
of
josiah
some
of
the
boys
called
him
old
bluenose
because
of
the
large
purple
vein
on
the
side
of
his
nose
it
made
him
look
rather
cross
he
probably
would
want
abe
to
pay
for
the
book
and
abe
had
no
money
he
opened
the
crawford
gate
and
marched
up
to
the
kitchen
door
josiah
his
wife
elizabeth
and
sammy
their
little
boy
were
having
breakfast
when
abe
explained
what
had
happened
crawford
patted
his
shoulder
he
liked
her
she
was
always
nice
to
him
but
he
knew
that
her
husband
was
the
one
who
would
decide
about
the
book
josiah
took
it
in
his
big
hands
and
looked
at
the
stained
pages
well
abe
he
said
slowly
i
wo
be
hard
on
you
if
you
want
to
pull
fodder
three
days
for
me
that
ought
to
pay
for
the
book
starting
right
now
yep
starting
right
now
josiah
was
actually
smiling
then
you
can
have
the
book
to
keep
abe
caught
his
breath
what
a
lucky
boy
he
was
three
days
work
and
he
could
keep
the
book
he
would
have
a
chance
to
read
about
george
washington
any
time
he
wanted
to
never
had
he
worked
harder
or
faster
than
he
did
that
morning
when
the
noon
dinner
bell
rang
he
seemed
to
be
walking
on
air
as
he
followed
josiah
into
the
cabin
sally
was
putting
dinner
on
the
table
abe
slipped
up
behind
her
and
pulled
one
of
her
pigtails
taken
by
surprise
she
jumped
and
dropped
a
pitcher
of
cream
the
pitcher
did
not
break
but
the
cream
spilled
and
spread
over
the
kitchen
floor
illustration
abe
lincoln
look
what
you
made
me
do
cried
sally
i
just
washed
that
floor
and
look
at
that
good
cream
going
to
waste
going
to
waste
abe
pointed
to
elizabeth
crawford
cat
which
was
lapping
up
the
delicious
yellow
stream
then
he
began
to
sing
cat
in
the
cream
jar
shoo
shoo
shoo
stop
trying
to
show
off
said
sally
she
was
angry
but
sammy
elizabeth
little
boy
shouted
with
delight
that
was
all
the
encouragement
abe
needed
the
fact
that
he
could
not
carry
a
tune
did
not
seem
to
bother
him
cat
in
the
cream
jar
shoo
shoo
shoo
cat
in
the
cream
jar
shoo
shoo
shoo
skip
to
my
lou
my
darling
sally
was
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
wiping
up
the
cream
stop
singing
that
silly
song
and
help
me
instead
abe
danced
a
jig
he
leaned
down
and
pulled
her
other
pigtail
illustration
sally
in
the
cream
jar
shoo
shoo
shoo
that
enough
abe
said
elizabeth
crawford
skip
to
my
lou
my
darling
he
whirled
around
on
his
bare
feet
and
made
a
sweeping
bow
sally
was
close
to
tears
abe
i
told
you
to
stop
said
elizabeth
crawford
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
teasing
your
sister
if
you
keep
on
acting
that
way
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
become
of
you
me
abe
drew
himself
up
what
going
to
become
of
me
i
going
to
be
president
elizabeth
looked
at
him
a
lanky
barefoot
boy
with
trousers
too
short
his
shirt
was
in
rags
his
black
hair
was
tousled
she
sank
into
a
chair
shaking
with
laughter
a
pretty
president
you
make
now
would
you
she
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
she
wanted
to
take
back
the
words
all
of
the
joy
went
out
of
his
face
sally
was
too
angry
to
notice
maybe
you
going
to
be
president
she
said
but
first
you
better
learn
to
behave
i
i
was
just
funning
sally
something
in
his
voice
made
sally
look
up
she
saw
the
hurt
expression
in
his
eyes
i
know
you
were
she
said
hastily
i
not
mad
any
more
abe
ate
his
dinner
in
silence
he
did
not
seem
to
be
the
same
boy
who
had
been
cutting
up
only
a
few
minutes
before
elizabeth
kept
telling
herself
that
she
should
not
have
laughed
at
him
he
did
try
to
show
off
sometimes
but
he
was
a
good
boy
she
thought
more
of
him
than
of
any
of
the
other
young
folks
in
pigeon
creek
not
for
anything
would
she
have
hurt
his
feelings
when
he
pushed
back
his
stool
she
followed
him
out
into
the
yard
about
your
being
president
she
said
i
was
aiming
to
make
fun
of
you
i
just
meant
that
you
with
all
your
tricks
and
jokes
i
reckon
i
know
what
you
meant
said
abe
quietly
all
the
same
crawford
i
do
always
mean
to
delve
and
grub
and
such
like
there
was
a
look
of
determination
on
his
face
that
she
had
not
seen
before
i
think
a
heap
of
you
she
went
on
and
i
do
want
to
see
you
disappointed
it
a
fine
thing
to
be
ambitious
but
do
let
reading
about
george
washington
give
you
notions
that
ca
come
to
anything
abe
threw
back
his
shoulders
i
aim
to
study
and
get
ready
and
then
the
chance
will
come
he
lifted
his
battered
straw
hat
and
started
down
the
path
toward
the
field
he
walked

i
tell

what
the
preacher
said
sarah
smiled
at
him
fondly
abe

listen
to
a
sermon
then
come
home
and
repeat
it
almost
word
for
word
i
rather
hear
you
preachify
she
said
than
the
preacher
himself
tom
and
his
family
walked
single
file
into
the
log
meeting
house
and
took
their
places
on
one
of
the
long
wooden
benches
john
carter
sitting
on
the
bench
in
front
of
them
turned
and
nodded
carter
had
promised
to
buy
the
lincolns
south
field
he
would
have
the
papers
ready
for
tom
to
sign
on
monday
tom
needed
the
money
but
the
very
thought
of
selling
any
of
his
land
made
him
grumpy
he
twisted
and
turned
on
the
hard
wooden
bench
during
the
long
sermon
he
hardly
heard
a
word
that
the
preacher
was
saying
abe
leaned
forward
and
listened
eagerly
the
preacher
was
a
tall
thin
man
he
flung
his
arms
about
his
voice
grew
louder
and
hoarser
as
the
morning
passed
he
paused
only
to
catch
his
breath
or
when
the
members
of
the
congregation
shouted
amen
after
the
final
hymn
he
stood
at
the
door
shaking
hands
brother
lincoln
he
said
i
want
you
to
meet
up
with
a
new
neighbor
this
here
is
mr
swaney
tom
shook
hands
then
the
preacher
introduced
abe
are
you
the
new
schoolmaster
abe
asked
i
do
figure
on
starting
school
till
after
harvest
swaney
replied
will
you
be
one
of
my
scholars
i
sure
like
to
come
abe
glanced
at
his
father
i
reckon
not
said
tom
stiffly
abe
has
had
as
much
schooling
as
he
needs
back
at
the
cabin
sarah
had
dinner
on
the
table
tom
cheered
up
as
he
and
dennis
started
swapping
yarns
both
were
good
storytellers
and
each
tried
to
tell
a
better
story
than
the
other
abe
did
not
like
being
left
out
of
the
conversation
pa
he
asked
can
you
answer
me
a
question
about
something
in
the
bible
i
figure
i
can
answer
any
question
you
got
sense
enough
to
ask
johnny
and
mathilda
nudged
each
other
they
knew
what
was
coming
one
day
when
the
preacher
stopped
by
abe
had
asked
him
the
same
question
the
preacher
had
been
downright
flustered
when
he
could
answer
it
just
this
pa
abe
went
on
who
was
the
father
of
children
tom
flushed
any
uppity
young
one
can
ask
a
question
but
can
he
answer
it
suppose
tell
who
was
the
father
of
zebedee
children
i
sort
of
figured
said
abe
that
zebedee
was
everyone
was
laughing
except
tom
then
he
laughed
too
sarah
was
glad
abe
had
told
her
that
swaney
was
at
church
she
was
going
to
talk
to
her
husband
that
very
afternoon
about
sending
the
children
to
school
and
she
wanted
him
to
be
in
a
good
humor
what
did
the
preacher
have
to
say
she
asked
well
tom
was
trying
to
remember
what
he
said
sort
of
got
lost
in
the
way
he
was
saying
it
how
some
of
those
preachers
do
hop
and
skip
about
i
like
to
hear
a
preacher
who
acts
like
he
fighting
bees
said
abe
sarah
nodded
the
description
fitted
the
preacher
like
his
own
moccasin
she
said
you
menfolks
wait
outside
she
added
soon
as
the
gals
and
i
get
the
dishes
done
we
be
out
to
hear
abe
preachify
illustration
the
afternoon
was
warm
sarah
fanned
herself
with
her
apron
as
she
sat
down
at
one
end
of
a
fallen
log
near
the
door
the
rest
of
the
family
lined
up
beside
her
abe
stood
before
them
his
arms
folded
as
he
repeated
the
sermon
he
had
heard
that
morning
now
and
then
he
paused
and
shook
his
finger
in
the
faces
of
his
congregation
he
pounded
with
one
fist
on
the
palm
of
his
other
hand
brethern
and
sisters
said
abe
there
ai
no
chore
too
big
for
the
lord
no
chore
too
small
the
good
book
says
he
knows
when
a
sparrow
falls
yet
he
had
time
to
turn
this
great
big
wilderness
into
this
here
land
where
we
have
our
homes
just
think
folks
this
pigeon
creek
had
no
one
but
indians
living
here
a
few
years
back
and
today
we
got
cabins
with
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimneys
we
got
crops
agrowing
we
got
a
meeting
house
where
we
can
come
together
and
praise
the
lord
abe
paused
amen
said
tom
amen
said
the
others
do
forget
abe
went
on
all
of
this
was
the
lord
doing
let
us
praise
him
for
his
goodness
he
reached
down
plucked
a
fistful
of
grass
and
mopped
his
forehead
in
much
the
same
way
had
the
preacher
used
his
bandanna
handkerchief
the
lincoln
family
rose
sang
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
and
church
was
over
the
young
folks
drifted
away
tom
stretched
out
on
the
grass
for
his
sunday
afternoon
nap
abe
tells
me
that
new
swaney

sarah
said
tom

tom
cautiously

and
stalked
across

grass
he
lay
down
under

tree
out

sarah
sat
on
the
log
for
a
long
time

down
beside

looking
at
her
that
she
had
been
talking
to
his
father
about

him
go
to

stopped
embarrassed
sarah
was
soaking
a
cloth
in
a
basin
of
cold
water
she
laid
it
on
his
eye
what
started
it
all
you
tell
them
abe
said
tom
that
carter
ai
as
smart
as
he
thinks
he
is
abe
explained
he
had
a
paper
for
pa
to
sign
and
tried
to
make
out
it
was
for
just
the
south
field
and
do
you
know
what
mamma
when
pa
asked
me
to
read
it
why
it
was
for
almost
our
whole
farm
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
said
sarah
carter
said
he
have
a
new
paper
made
out
but
i
told
him
tom
added
with
a
touch
of
pride
i
could
do
without
his
money
good
for
you
sarah
said
beaming
do
you
fret
we
squeak
through
somehow
but
what
if
you
had
signed
that
paper
the
farm
would
have
been
sold
right
out
from
under
us
i
reckon
we
can
feel
mighty
proud
of
abe
well
tom
admitted
it
did
hurt
that
he
knew
how
to
read
when
did
you
say
swaney
aims
to
start
his
school
right
after
harvest
said
abe
before
his
stepmother
had
a
chance
to
answer
tom
ignored
him
and
went
on
talking
to
his
wife
now
mind
you
sairy
i
ai
saying
abe
needs
any
more
eddication
i
ai
saying
it
is
fitting
a
son
should
know
his
pa
but
if
you
think
the
young
ones
should
go
to
this
new
school
for
a
spell
i
wo
say
no
he
rose
and
stalked
out
of
the
cabin
then
he
came
back
and
stuck
his
head
in
at
the
door
mind
you
abe
you
forget
to
do
your
chores
just
one
time
and
that
schoolmaster
wo
be
seeing
you
again
come
back
in
and
sit
down
tom
said
sarah
supper
is
nearly
ready
besides
abe
has
something
that
needs
saying
abe
looked
at
his
stepmother
in
surprise
then
he
looked
at
his
father
i
much
obliged
pa
he
said
illustration
after
a
few
weeks
at
master
swaney
school
abe
had
to
stop
and
go
to
work
again
when
he
was
seventeen
he
had
a
chance
to
attend
another
school
kept
by
azel
dorsey
nearly
every
friday
afternoon
there
were
special
exercises
and
the
scholars
spoke
pieces
for
the
final
program
on
the
last
day
of
school
the
boys
had
built
a
platform
outside
the
log
schoolhouse
parents
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
found
seats
on
fallen
logs
and
on
the
grass
they
listened
proudly
as
one
by
one
the
children
came
forward
and
each
recited
a
poem
or
a
speech
master
dorsey
walked
to
the
front
of
the
platform
he
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
we
come
to
the
last
number
on
our
program
years
ago
thomas
jefferson
became
president
of
these
united
states
we
shall
now
hear
the
speech
he
made
that
day
abraham
lincoln
will
recite
it
for
us
sarah
lincoln
from
under
her
pink
sunbonnet
stole
a
glance
at
tom
i
hope
that
abe
does
well
she
whispered
abe
did
do
well
he
forgot
that
he
was
growing
too
fast
that
his
hands
were
too
big
and
that
his
trousers
were
too
short
for
a
few
minutes
he
made
his
audience
forget
it
master
dorsey
seemed
to
swell
with
pride
if
that
boy
lives
he
thought
he
is
going
to
be
a
noted
man
some
day
elizabeth
crawford
sitting
in
the
front
row
remembered
what
he
had
said
about
being
president
if
she
closed
her
eyes
she
could
almost
imagine
that
thomas
jefferson
was
speaking
when
abe
finished
and
made
an
awkward
bow
she
joined
in
the
hearty
burst
of
applause
do
you
know
where
he
got
that
piece
she
asked
her
husband
in
a
low
voice
from
kentucky
one
of
the
books
you
loaned
him
it
makes
a
body
feel
good
to
think
we
helped
him
look
at
lincoln
she
could
be
more
pleased
if
abe
was
her
own
son
sarah
waited
to
walk
home
with
him
i
was
mighty
proud
of
you
today
she
said
why
what
the
matter
you
look
mighty
for
a
boy
who
spoke
his
piece
so
well
on
the
last
day
i
was
thinking
that
this
is
the
last
day
he
answered
the
last
day
i
ever
go
to
school
most
likely
well
you
seventeen
now
yes
i
seventeen
and
i
ai
had
a
year
schooling
all
told
i
ca
even
talk
proper
i
forget
and
say
though
i
know
it
ai
i
mean
is
right
it
seems
to
me
you
educating
yourself
with
all
those
books
you
read
said
sarah
cheerfully
i
already
read
all
the
books
for
miles
around
besides
i
want
to
see
places
i
ca
help
it
ma
i
want
to
get
away
sarah
looked
at
him
fondly
she
wished
that
she
could
find
some
way
to
help
him
abe
found
ways
to
help
himself
he
was
never
to
go
to
school
again
but
he
could
walk
to
rockport
to
attend
trials
in
the
log
courthouse
he
liked
to
listen
to
the
lawyers
argue
their
cases
sometimes
he
would
write
down
what
they
said
on
a
piece
of
paper
now
and
then
he
had
a
chance
to
borrow
a
book
that
he
had
not
read
before
from
some
new
settler
he
read
the
old
books
over
and
over
again
he
liked
to
read
the
newspapers
to
which
gentry
allen
father
subscribed
the
papers
told
what
was
going
on
in
the
big
world
outside
of
pigeon
creek
james
gentry
owned
the
log
store
at
the
crossroads
where
the
little
town
gentryville
had
grown
up
his
partner
william
jones
was
one
of
abe
best
friends
and
abe
spent
nearly
every
evening
at
the
store
it
became
the
favorite
meeting
place
for
the
men
and
boys
who
lived
close
by
howdy
abe
everyone
seemed
to
be
saying
it
at
once
when
he
came
in
the
louisville
paper
came
today
william
jones
might
add
here
you
are
the
fellows
have
been
waiting
for
you
to
holler
out
the
news
illustration
abe
sat
on
the
counter
swinging
his
long
legs
as
he
read
the
newspaper
out
loud
the
men
sat
quietly
except
when
william
got
up
to
throw
another
log
on
the
fire
or
to
light
another
candle
abe
read
on
and
on
after
he
finished
the
paper
they
talked
about
what
he
had
read
they
argued
about
many
things
from
politics
to
religion
they
always
wanted
to
know
what
abe
thought
many
times
they
stayed
until
nearly
midnight
listening
to
him
one
evening
not
long
after
abe
nineteenth
birthday
he
walked
home
from
the
store
in
great
excitement
he
had
been
very
sad
since
his
sister
sally
had
died
in
january
but
tonight
he
seemed
more
cheerful
sarah
looked
up
to
find
him
standing
in
the
doorway
what
do
you
think
has
happened
ma
he
asked
i
am
going
to
new
orleans
how
come
abe
sarah
knew
that
prosperous
farmers
sometimes
loaded
their
corn
and
other
farm
products
on
big
flatboats
these
flatboats
were
floated
down
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
to
new
orleans
where
the
cargoes
were
sold
but
the
lincolns
raised
only
enough
for
their
own
use
they
never
had
anything
left
over
to
sell
nor
could
they
afford
to
build
a
flatboat
for
the
long
trip
down
the
rivers
how
come
sarah
asked
again
abe
seized
her
around
the
waist
and
danced
her
across
the
floor
she
was
out
of
breath
but
laughing
when
he
let
her
go
allen
gentry
is
taking
a
cargo
of
farm
truck
down
to
new
orleans
to
sell
he
explained
his
pa
has
hired
me
to
help
on
the
flatboat
gentry
will
pay
me
eight
dollars
a
month
i
reckon
pa
will
be
pleased
about
that
abe
himself
was
pleased
because
he
was
going
to
see
something
of
the
world
new
orleans
was
seven
hundred
miles
away
it
was
a
big
and
important
city
sarah
was
pleased
because
this
was
the
chance
that
abe
had
been
wanting
he
had
grown
so
tall
that
she
had
to
throw
back
her
head
to
look
up
at
him
i
right
glad
for
you
she
said
illustration
to
a
boy
brought
up
in
the
backwoods
the
trip
down
the
rivers
was
one
long
adventure
abe
sat
at
the
forward
oar
guiding
the
big
flatboat
through
the
calm
blue
waters
of
the
ohio
while
allen
cooked
supper
on
deck
afterwards
abe
told
stories
after
they
had
reached
the
southern
tip
of
illinois
where
the
ohio
emptied
into
the
yellow
waters
of
the
mississippi
there
was
little
time
for
stories
the
boys
never
knew
what
to
expect
next
one
minute
the
river
would
be
quiet
and
calm
the
next
it
would
rise
in
the
fury
of
a
sudden
storm
the
waves
rose
in
a
yellow
flood
that
poured
over
the
deck
allen
at
the
back
oar
abe
at
the
front
oar
had
a
hard
time
keeping
the
big
flatboat
from
turning
over
at
the
end
of
each
day
the
boys
tied
up
the
boat
at
some
place
along
the
shore
one
night
after
they
had
gone
to
sleep
several
robbers
crept
on
board
abe
and
allen
awoke
just
in
time
after
a
long
hard
fight
the
robbers
turned
and
fled
illustration
these
dangers
only
made
their
adventures
seem
more
exciting
it
was
exciting
too
to
be
a
part
of
the
traffic
of
the
river
they
saw
many
other
flatboats
like
their
own
the
biggest
thrill
was
in
watching
the
steamboats
with
giant
paddle
wheels
that
turned
the
water
into
foam
their
decks
were
painted
a
gleaming
white
and
their
brass
rails
shone
in
the
sun
no
wonder
they
were
called
floating
palaces
thought
abe
sometimes
passengers
standing
by
the
rail
waved
to
the
boys
each
day
of
their
journey
brought
gentler
breezes
warmer
weather
cottonwood
and
magnolia
trees
grew
on
the
low
swampy
banks
of
both
shores
the
boys
passed
cotton
fields
where
gangs
of
negro
slaves
were
at
work
some
of
them
were
singing
as
they
bent
to
pick
the
snowy
white
balls
of
cotton
a
snatch
of
song
came
floating
over
the
water
oh
brother
do
get
weary
oh
brother
do
get
weary
oh
brother
do
get
weary
we
waiting
for
the
lord
illustration
abe
leaned
on
his
oar
to
listen
a
few
minutes
later
he
pointed
to
a
big
house
with
tall
white
pillars
in
the
middle
of
a
beautiful
garden
nice
little
cabin
those
folks
have
he
said
drily
do
recollect
seeing
anything
like
that
up
in
pigeon
creek
why
abe
you
have
seen
anything
yet
just
wait
till
you
get
to
new
orleans
this
was
allen
second
trip
and
he
was
eager
to
show
abe
the
sights
a
few
days
later
they
were
walking
along
the
new
orleans
waterfront
ships
from
many
different
countries
were
tied
up
at
the
wharves
negro
slaves
were
rolling
bales
of
cotton
onto
a
steamboat
other
negroes
toting
huge
baskets
on
their
heads
passed
by
sailors
from
many
lands
speaking
strange
tongues
rubbed
elbows
with
fur
trappers
dressed
in
buckskins
from
the
far
northwest
a
cotton
planter
in
a
white
suit
glanced
at
the
two
youths
from
pigeon
creek
he
seemed
amused
abe
looked
down
at
his
homespun
blue
jeans
he
had
not
realized
that
all
young
men
did
not
wear
them
reckon
we
do
look
different
from
some
of
the
folks
down
here
he
said
as
he
and
allen
turned
into
a
narrow
street
here
there
were
more
people
always
more
people
the
public
square
was
crowded
abe
gazed
in
awe
at
the
cathedral
this
tall
spanish
church
with
its
two
graceful
towers
was
so
different
from
the
log
meeting
house
that
the
lincolns
attended
nor
was
there
anything
back
in
pigeon
creek
like
the
tall
plaster
houses
faded
by
time
and
weather
into
warm
tones
of
pink
and
lavender
and
yellow
the
balconies
or
porches
on
the
upper
floors
had
wrought
iron
railings
of
such
delicate
design
that
they
looked
like
iron
lace
once
the
boys
paused
before
a
wrought
iron
gate
at
the
end
of
a
long
passageway
they
could
see
a
courtyard
where
flowers
bloomed
and
a
fountain
splashed
in
the
sunshine
abe
turned
to
watch
a
handsome
carriage
roll
by
over
the
cobblestones
he
looked
down
the
street
toward
the
river
which
sheltered
ships
from
all
over
the
world
all
this
makes
me
feel
a
little
like
sinbad
he
said
but
i
reckon
even
sinbad
never
visited
new
orleans
i
sure
do
like
it
here
but
soon
abe
began
to
see
other
sights
that
made
him
sick
at
heart
he
and
allen
passed
a
warehouse
where
slaves
were
being
sold
at
auction
a
crowd
had
gathered
inside
several
negroes
were
standing
on
a
platform
called
an
auction
block
one
by
one
they
stepped
forward
a
man
called
an
auctioneer
asked
in
a
loud
voice
what
am
i
offered
who
will
make
the
first
bid
five
hundred
called
one
man
six
hundred
called
another
the
bids
mounted
higher
each
slave
was
sold
to
the
man
who
bid
or
offered
to
pay
the
most
money
one
field
hand
and
his
wife
were
sold
to
different
bidders
there
were
tears
in
the
woman
dark
eyes
as
he
was
led
away
she
knew
that
she
would
never
see
her
husband
again
let
get
out
of
here
said
abe
i
ca
stand
any
more
they
walked
back
to
their
own
flatboat
tied
up
at
one
of
the
wharves
allen
got
supper
but
abe
could
not
eat
do
look
like
that
said
allen
many
of
the
folks
down
here
inherited
their
slaves
same
as
their
land
slavery
ai
their
fault
i
never
said
it
was
anybody
fault
at
least
not
anybody
who
living
now
but
it
just
ai
right
for
one
man
to
own
another
well
stop
worrying
there
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
maybe
not
said
abe
gloomily
but
i
mighty
glad
there
are
any
slaves
in
indiana
allen
stayed
on
in
new
orleans
for
several
days
to
sell
his
cargo
it
brought
a
good
price
he
then
sold
his
flatboat
which
would
be
broken
up
and
used
for
lumber
flatboats
could
not
travel
upstream
he
and
abe
would
either
have
to
walk
back
to
indiana
or
they
could
take
a
steamboat
we
better
not
walk
carrying
all
this
money
said
allen
pretty
lonely
country
going
home
we
might
get
robbed
the
steamboat
trip
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
abe
had
not
expected
he
enjoyed
talking
with
the
other
passengers
the
speed
at
which
they
traveled
seemed
a
miracle
it
had
taken
the
boys
a
month
to
make
the
trip
downstream
by
flatboat
they
were
returning
upstream
in
little
more
than
a
week
they
were
standing
together
by
the
rail
when
the
cabins
of
rockport
perched
on
a
high
wooded
bluff
came
into
view
it
sure
was
good
of
your
pa
to
give
me
this
chance
said
abe
seen
some
sights
i
wish
i
had
but
the
trip
has
done
me
good
sort
of
stretched
my
eyes
and
ears
stretched
me
all
over
inside
i
mean
he
laughed
i
do
need
any
stretching
on
the
outside
allen
looked
at
his
tall
friend
they
had
been
together
most
of
the
time
they
had
talked
with
the
same
people
visited
the
same
places
seen
the
same
sights
already
allen
was
beginning
to
forget
them
now
that
he
was
almost
home
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
been
away
but
abe
seemed
different
somehow
he
had
changed
i
ca
figure
it
out
allen
told
him
you
do
seem
the
same
maybe
i
not
said
abe
i
keep
thinking
about
some
of
the
things
i
saw
illustration
the
lincolns
were
leaving
pigeon
creek
one
day
a
letter
had
arrived
from
john
hanks
a
cousin
who
had
gone
to
illinois
to
live
the
soil
was
richer
there
the
letter
said
why
did
tom
come
too
and
bring
his
family
he
would
find
it
easier
to
make
a
living
even
the
name
of
the
river
near
john
home
had
a
pleasant
sound
it
was
called
the
sangamon
an
indian
word
meaning
plenty
to
eat
we
going
tom
decided
i
going
to
sell
this
farm
and
buy
another
do
you
want
to
come
with
us
abe
two
years
had
passed
since
abe

welcome
then
took
them
to
see
the
place
that
he
had
selected
for
their
farm
in
the
cold
winter
light

almost
as
desolate
as

sarah
said
nothing
for
a
moment
if
abe
went
away
to
stay
the
cabin

seem
mighty
lonesome
she
would
miss
him
terribly
but
she
wanted
him
to
do
whatever
was
best
for
him
offut
said
he

that

keep
his
wages
for
himself
i
reckon

aloud

high
time
that
i
start
out
on
my
own
sarah
set
to
work
to
get
his
clothes
ready
he
was
wearing
his
only
pair
of
jeans
and
there
was
much
else
for
him
to
take
she
washed
his
shirts
and
the
extra
pair
of
socks
that
she
had
knit
for
him
he
wrapped
these
up
in
a
big
cloth
and
tied
the
bundle
to
the
end
of
a
long
stick
the
next
morning
he
was
up
early
after
he
told
the
rest
of
the
family
sarah
walked
with
him
to
the
gate
abe
thrust
the
stick
with
his
bundle
over
his
shoulder
he
had
looked
forward
to
starting
out
on
his
own
and
now
he
was
scared
almost
as
scared
as
he
had
felt
on
that
cold
winter
afternoon
when
his
new
mother
had
first
arrived
in
pigeon
creek
because
she
had
believed
in
him
he
had
started
believing
in
himself
her
faith
in
him
was
still
shining
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
up
at
him
and
tried
to
smile
he
gave
her
a
quick
hug
and
hurried
down
the
path
it
was
a
long
long
walk
to
new
salem
where
abe
arrived
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
this
village
on
a
high
bluff
overlooking
the
sangamon
river
was
bigger
than
gentryville
bigger
even
than
rockport
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
one
street
bordered
on
both
sides
by
a
row
of
neat
log
houses
he
counted
more
than
buildings
there
were
several
stores
and
he
could
see
the
mill
down
by
the
river
illustration
he
pushed
his
way
through
a
crowd
that
had
gathered
before
one
of
the
houses
a
man
about
ten
years
older
than
abe
sat
behind
a
table
on
the
little
porch
he
was
writing
in
a
big
book
howdy
mister
said
abe
what

excitement
about
this
is
election
day
the
man
replied
and

clerk

i
one
of
the
clerks
he
stopped
to
write
down
the
name
of
one
of
the
men
who
stood
in
line
he
wrote
the
names
of
several
other
voters
in
his
big
book
before
he
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
abe
again
then
he
explained
that
the
other
clerk
who
was
supposed
to
help
him
was
sick
i
mighty
busy
he
went
on
say
listen
stranger
do
you
know
how
to
write
i
can
make
a
few
rabbit
tracks
abe
said
grinning
maybe
i
can
hire
you
to
help
me
keep
a
record
of
the
votes
the
man
rose
and
shook
hands
my
name
is
mentor
graham
by
evening
the
younger
man
and
the
older
one
had
become
good
friends
graham
was
a
schoolmaster
and
he
promised
to
help
abe
with
his
studies
soon
abe
began
to
make
other
friends
jack
kelso
took
him
fishing
abe
did
not
care
much
about
fishing
but
he
liked
to
hear
jack
recite
poetry
by
robert
burns
and
william
shakespeare
they
were
favorite
poets
and
they
became
abe
favorites
too
at
the
rutledge
tavern
where
abe
lived
for
a
while
he
met
the
daughter
ann
rutledge
ann
was
sweet
and
pretty
with
a
glint
of
sunshine
in
her
hair
they
took
long
walks
beside
the
river
it
was
easy
to
talk
to
ann
and
abe
told
her
some
of
his
secret
hopes
she
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
great
man
some
day
her
father
james
rutledge
also
took
an
interest
in
him
abe
was
invited
to
join
the
new
salem
debating
society
the
first
time
that
he
got
up
to
talk
the
other
members
expected
him
to
spend
the
time
telling
funny
stories
instead
he
made
a
serious
speech
and
a
very
good
one
that
young
man
has
more
than
wit
and
fun
in
his
head
rutledge
told
his
wife
that
night
abe
liked
to
make
speeches
but
he
knew
that
he
did
not
always
speak
correctly
one
morning
he
was
having
breakfast
at
mentor
graham
house
i
have
a
notion
to
study
english
grammar
he
said
if
you
expect
to
go
before
the
public
mentor
answered
i
think
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
if
i
had
a
grammar
i
would
commence
now
mentor
thought
for
a
moment
there
is
no
one
in
town
who
owns
a
grammar
he
said
finally
but
vaner
out
in
the
country
has
one
he
might
lend
you
his
copy
abe
got
up
from
the
table
and
walked
six
miles
to
the
vaner
farm
when
he
returned
he
carried
an
open
book
in
his
hands
he
was
studying
grammar
as
he
walked
meanwhile
he
worked
as
a
clerk
in
denton
offut
store
customers
could
buy
all
sorts
of
things
there
tools
and
nails
needles
and
thread
mittens
and
calico
and
tallow
for
making
candles
one
day
a
woman
bought
several
yards
of
calico
after
she
left
abe
discovered
that
he
had
charged
her
six
cents
too
much
that
evening
he
walked
six
miles
to
give
her
the
money
he
was
always
doing
things
like
that
and
people
began
to
call
him
honest
abe
denton
was
so
proud
of
his
clerk
that
he
could
not
help
boasting
abe
is
the
smartest
man
in
the
united
states
he
said
yes
and
he
can
beat
any
man
in
the
country
running
jumping
or
wrastling
a
bunch
of
young
roughnecks
lived
a
few
miles
away
in
another
settlement
called
clary
grove
that
denton
offut
talks
too
much
with
his
mouth
they
said
angrily
they
did
not
mind
abe
being
called
smart
but
they
declared
that
no
one
could
their
leader
jack
armstrong
one
day
they
rushed
into
the
store
and
dared
abe
to
fight
with
jack
abe
laid
down
the
book
that
he
had
been
reading
i
do
hold
with
wooling
and
pulling
he
said
but
if
you
want
to
fight
come
on
outside
the
clary
grove
boys
soon
realized
that
denton
clerk
was
a
good
wrestler
jack
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
lose
the
fight
stepped
on
abe
foot
with
the
sharp
heel
of
his
boot
the
sudden
pain
made
abe
angry
the
next
thing
that
jack
knew
he
was
being
shaken
back
and
forth
until
his
teeth
rattled
then
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
the
dust
jack
friends
let
out
a
howl
of
rage
several
of
them
rushed
at
abe
all
trying
to
fight
him
at
the
same
time
he
stood
with
his
back
against
the
store
his
fists
doubled
up
he
dared
them
to
come
closer
jack
picked
himself
up
stop
it
fellows
he
said
i
was
beaten
in
a
fair
fight
if
you
ask
me
this
abe
lincoln
is
the
cleverest
fellow
that
ever
broke
into
the
settlement
from
then
on
jack
was
one
of
abe
best
friends
a
short
time
later
abe
enlisted
as
a
soldier
in
the
black
hawk
war
to
help
drive
the
indians
out
of
illinois
the
clary
grove
boys
were
in
his
company
and
abe
was
elected
captain
before
his
company
had
a
chance
to
do
any
fighting
blackhawk
was
captured
in
another
part
of
illinois
and
the
war
was
over
when
abe
came
back
to
new
salem
he
found
himself
out
of
a
job
denton
offut
had
left
the
store
had
winked
out
later
abe
and
another
young
man
william
berry
decided
to
become
partners
they
borrowed
money
and
started
a
store
of
their
own
one
day
a
wagon
piled
high
with
furniture
stopped
out
in
front
a
man
jumped
down
and
explained
that
he
and
his
family
were
moving
west
the
wagon
was
too
crowded
and
he
had
a
barrel
of
odds
and
ends
that
he
wanted
to
sell
abe
always
glad
to
oblige
agreed
to
pay
fifty
cents
for
it
later
when
he
opened
it
he
had
a
wonderful
surprise
the
barrel
contained
a
set
of
famous
law
books
he
had
seen
those
same
books
in
pitcher
law
office
in
rockport
now
that
he
owned
a
set
of
his
own
he
could
read
it
any
time
he
wished
customers
coming
into
the
store
usually
found
abe
lying
on
the
counter
his
nose
buried
in
one
of
the
new
books
the
more
he
read
the
more
interested
he
became
perhaps
he
spent
too
much
time
reading
instead
of
attending
to
business
william
berry
was
lazy
and
not
a
very
satisfactory
partner
the
store
of
lincoln
and
berry
did
so
little
business
that
it
had
to
close
the
partners
were
left
with
many
debts
to
pay
then
berry
died
and
honest
abe
announced
that
he
would
pay
all
of
the
debts
himself
no
matter
how
long
it
took
for
a
while
he
was
postmaster
a
man
on
horseback
brought
the
mail
twice
a
week
and
there
were
so
few
letters
that
abe
often
carried
them
around
in
his
hat
until
he
could
deliver
them
he
liked
the
job
because
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
read
the
newspapers
to
which
the
people
in
new
salem
subscribed
but
the
pay
was
small
and
he
had
to
do
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
to
earn
enough
to
eat
on
many
days
he
would
have
gone
hungry
if
jack
armstrong
and
his
wife
hannah
had
not
invited
him
to
dinner
when
work
was
scarce
he
stayed
with
them
two
or
three
weeks
at
a
time
he
knew
that
he
had
to
find
a
way
to
earn
more
money
and
he
decided
to
study
surveying
it
was
a
hard
subject
but
he
borrowed
some
books
and
read
them
carefully
he
studied
so
hard
that
in
six
weeks
time
he
took
his
first
job
as
a
surveyor
sometimes
when
he
was
measuring
a
farm
or
laying
out
a
new
road
he
would
be
gone
for
several
weeks
people
miles
from
new
salem
knew
who
abe
lincoln
was
they
laughed
at
him
because
he
was
so
tall
and
awkward
they
thought
it
funny
that
his
trousers
were
always
too
short
but
they
also
laughed
at
his
jokes
and
they
liked
him
he
made
so
many
new
friends
that
he
decided
to
be
a
candidate
for
the
illinois
legislature
one
day
during
the
campaign
he
had
a
long
talk
with
major
john
stuart
major
stuart
had
been
abe
commander
in
the
black
hawk
war
he
was
now
a
lawyer
in
springfield
a
larger
town
twenty
miles
away
why
do
you
study
law
he
asked
abe
pursed
his
lips
i
sure
like
to
he
drawled
then
added
with
a
grin
but
i
do
know
if
i
have
enough
sense
major
stuart
paid
no
attention
to
this
last
remark
you
have
been
reading
law
for
pleasure
he
went
on
now
go
at
it
in
earnest
lend
you
the
books
you
need
this
was
a
chance
that
abe
could
not
afford
to
miss
every
few
days
he
walked
or
rode
on
horseback
to
springfield
to
borrow
another
volume
sometimes
he
read
forty
pages
on
the
way
home
he
was
years
old
and
there
was
no
time
to
waste
meanwhile
he
was
making
many
speeches
he
asked
the
voters
in
his
part
of
illinois
to
elect
him
to
the
legislature
which
made
the
laws
for
the
state
they
felt
that
honest
abe
was
a
man
to
be
trusted
and
he
was
elected
late
in
november
abe
boarded
the
stagecoach
for
the
ride
to
vandalia
then
the
capital
of
the
state
he
looked
very
dignified
in
a
new
suit
and
high
plug
hat
in
the
crowd
that
gathered
to
tell
him
he
could
see
many
of
his
friends
there
stood
coleman
smoot
who
had
lent
him
money
to
buy
his
new
clothes
farther
back
he
could
see
rutledge
and
ann
hannah
and
jack
armstrong
mentor
graham
and
others
who
had
encouraged
and
helped
him
and
now
he
was
on
his
way
to
represent
them
in
the
legislature
there
was
a
chorus
of
abe
then
like
an
echo
the
words
came
again
in
ann
high
sweet
voice
abe
he
leaned
far
out
the
window
and
waved
he
was
thinking
of
ann
as
the
coach
rolled
over
the
rough
road
he
was
thinking
also
of
sarah
if
only
she
could
see
him
now
he
thought
as
he
glanced
at
the
new
hat
resting
on
his
knee
illustration
illustration
the
legislature
met
for
several
weeks
at
a
time
between
sessions
abe
worked
at
various
jobs
in
new
salem
and
read
his
law
books
most
of
his
studying
was
done
early
in
the
morning
and
late
at
night
he
still
found
time
to
see
a
great
deal
of
ann
rutledge
and
something
of
her
gentle
sweetness
was
to
live
on
forever
in
his
heart
after
ann
died
he
tried
to
forget
his
grief
by
studying
harder
than
ever
the
year
that
he
was
he
took
his
examination
and
was
granted
a
lawyer
license
he
decided
to
move
to
springfield
which
had
recently
been
made
the
capital
of
the
state
it
was
a
cold
march
day
when
he
rode
into
this
thriving
little
town
he
hitched
his
horse
to
the
hitching
rack
in
the
public
square
and
entered
one
of
the
stores
joshua
speed
the
owner
a
young
man
about
abe
age
looked
up
with
a
friendly
smile
howdy
abe
he
said
so
you
are
going
to
be
one
of
us
i
reckon
so
abe
answered
say
speed
i
just
bought
myself
a
bedstead
how
much
would
it
cost
me
for
a
mattress
and
some
pillows
and
blankets
joshua
took
a
pencil
from
behind
his
ear
he
did
some
figuring
on
a
piece
of
paper
i
can
fix
you
up
for
about
seventeen
dollars
abe
felt
the
money
in
his
pocket
he
had
only
seven
dollars
his
horse
was
borrowed
and
he
was
still
a
thousand
dollars
in
debt
joshua
saw
that
he
was
disappointed
he
had
heard
abe
make
speeches
and
abe
was
called
one
of
the
most
promising
young
men
in
the
legislature
joshua
liked
him
and
wanted
to
know
him
better
why
do
you
stay
with
me
until
you
can
do
better
he
suggested
i
have
a
room
over
the
store
and
a
bed
big
enough
for
two
a
grin
broke
over
abe
homely
features
good
he
said
where
is
it
you
find
some
stairs
over
there
behind
that
pile
of
barrels
go
on
up
and
make
yourself
at
home
abe
enjoyed
living
with
joshua
speed
and
he
enjoyed
living
in
springfield
he
soon
became
as
popular
as
he
had
once
been
in
pigeon
creek
and
in
new
salem
as
the
months
and
years
went
by
more
and
more
people
came
to
him
whenever
they
needed
a
lawyer
to
advise
them
for
a
long
time
he
was
poor
but
little
by
little
he
paid
off
his
debts
with
his
first
big
fee
he
bought
a
quarter
section
of
land
for
his
stepmother
who
had
been
so
good
to
him
the
part
of
his
work
that
abe
liked
best
was
riding
the
circuit
in
the
spring
and
again
in
the
fall
he
saddled
old
buck
his
horse
and
set
out
with
a
judge
and
several
other
lawyers
to
visit
some
of
the
towns
close
by
these
towns
on
the
circuit
were
too
small
to
have
law
courts
of
their
own
in
each
town
the
lawyers
argued
the
cases
and
the
judge
settled
the
disputes
that
had
come
up
during
the
past
six
months
after
supper
they
liked
to
gather
at
the
inn
to
listen
to
abe
tell
funny
stories
i
laughed
until
i
shook
my
ribs
loose
said
one
dignified
judge
the
other
lawyers
often
teased
abe
you
ought
to
charge
your
clients
more
money
they
said
or
you
will
always
be
as
poor
as
job
turkey
one
evening
they
held
a
mock
trial
abe
was
accused
of
charging
such
small
fees
that
the
other
lawyers
could
not
charge
as
much
as
they
should
the
judge
looked
as
solemn
as
he
did
at
a
real
trial
you
are
guilty
of
an
awful
crime
against
the
pockets
of
your
brother
lawyers
he
said
severely
i
hereby
sentence
you
to
pay
a
fine
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
i
pay
the
fine
said
abe
but
my
own
firm
is
never
going
to
be
known
as
catchem
cheatem
meanwhile
a
young
lady
named
mary
todd
had
come
to
springfield
to
live
her
father
was
a
rich
and
important
man
in
kentucky
mary
was
pretty
and
well
educated
abe
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
but
one
night
at
a
party
he
screwed
up
his
courage
to
ask
her
for
a
dance
illustration
miss
todd
he
said
i
would
like
to
dance
with
you
the
worst
way
as
he
swept
her
around
the
dance
floor
he
bumped
into
other
couples
he
stepped
on
her
toes
lincoln
said
mary
as
she
limped
over
to
a
chair
you
did
dance
with
me
the
worst
way
the
very
worst
she
did
not
mind
that
he
was
not
a
good
dancer
as
she
looked
up
into
abe
homely
face
she
decided
that
he
had
a
great
future
ahead
of
him
she
remembered
something
she
had
once
said
as
a
little
girl
when
i
grow
up
i
want
to
marry
a
man
who
will
be
president
of
the
united
states
abe
was
not
the
only
one
who
liked
mary
todd
among
the
other
young
men
who
came
to
see
her
was
another
lawyer
stephen
douglas
he
was
no
taller
than
mary
herself
but
he
had
such
a
large
head
and
shoulders
that
he
had
been
nicknamed
the
little
giant
he
was
handsome
and
rich
and
brilliant
his
friends
thought
that
he
might
be
president
some
day
no
said
mary
abe
lincoln
has
the
better
chance
to
succeed
anyway
abe
was
the
man
she
loved
the
next
year
they
were
married
i
mean
to
make
him
president
of
the
united
states
she
wrote
to
a
friend
in
kentucky
you
will
see
that
as
i
always
told
you
i
will
yet
be
the
president
wife
at
first
mary
thought
that
her
dream
was
coming
true
in
abe
was
elected
a
member
of
the
united
states
congress
in
washington
he
had
made
a
good
start
as
a
political
leader
and
she
was
disappointed
when
he
did
not
run
for
a
second
term
back
he
came
to
springfield
to
practice
law
again
by
there
were
three
lively
boys
romping
through
the
rooms
of
the
comfortable
white
house
that
he
had
bought
for
his
family
robert
was
eleven
willie
was
four
and
tad
was
still
a
baby
the
neighbors
used
to
smile
to
see
lawyer
lincoln
walking
down
the
street
carrying
tad
on
his
shoulders
while
willie
clung
to
his
coattails
the
boys
adored
their
father
mary
did
too
but
she
wished
that
abe
would
be
more
dignified
he
sat
reading
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
he
got
down
on
the
floor
to
play
with
the
boys
his
wife
did
not
think
that
was
any
way
for
a
successful
lawyer
to
act
it
also
worried
her
that
he
was
no
longer
interested
in
politics
and
then
something
happened
that
neither
mary
nor
abe
had
ever
expected
their
old
friend
stephen
douglas
who
was
now
a
senator
in
washington
suggested
a
new
law
thousands
of
settlers
were
going
west
to
live
and
in
time
they
would
form
new
states
the
new
law
would
make
it
possible
for
the
people
in
each
new
state
to
own
slaves
if
most
of
the
voters
wanted
to
abraham
lincoln
was
so
aroused
and
indignant
that
he
almost
forgot
his
law
practice
he
traveled
around
illinois
making
speeches
there
were
no
laws
against
having
slaves
in
the
south
but
slavery
must
be
kept
out
of
territory
that
was
still
free
he
said
the
new
states
should
be
places
for
poor
people
to
go
to
better
their
condition
not
only
that
but
it
was
wrong
for
one
man
to
own
another
terribly
wrong
if
the
negro
is
a
man
he
told
one
audience
then
my
ancient
faith
teaches
me
that
all
men
are
created
equal
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
first
time
he
had
visited
a
slave
market
he
was
remembering
the
words
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
had
thrilled
him
as
a
boy
two
years
later
abraham
lincoln
was
asked
to
be
a
candidate
for
the
united
states
senate
he
would
be
running
against
douglas
abe
wanted
very
much
to
be
a
senator
even
more
he
wanted
to
keep
slavery
out
of
the
new
states
taking
part
in
the
political
campaign
would
give
him
a
chance
to
say
the
things
that
he
felt
so
deeply
i
am
convinced
i
am
good
enough
for
it
he
told
a
friend
but
in
spite
of
it
all
i
am
saying
to
myself
every
day
is
too
big
a
thing
for
you
you
will
never
get
it
mary
insists
however
that
i
am
going
to
be
senator
and
president
of
the
united
states
too
perhaps
it
was
his
wife
faith
in
him
that
gave
him
the
courage
to
try
never
was
there
a
more
exciting
campaign
never
had
the
people
of
illinois
been
so
stirred
as
during
that
hot
summer
of
a
series
of
debates
was
held
in
seven
different
towns
the
two
candidates
douglas
the
little
giant
and
old
abe
the
giant
killer
as
his
friends
called
him
argued
about
slavery
people
came
from
miles
around
to
hear
them
on
the
day
of
a
debate
an
open
platform
for
the
speakers
was
decorated
with
bunting
flags
flew
from
the
housetops
when
senator
douglas
arrived
at
the
railroad
station
his
friends
and
admirers
met
him
with
a
brass
band
he
drove
to
his
hotel
in
a
fine
carriage
abe
had
admirers
too
sometimes
a
long
procession
met
him
at
the
station
then
abe
would
be
embarrassed
he
did
not
like
what
he
called
fizzlegigs
and
fireworks
but
he
laughed
when
his
friends
in
one
town
drove
him
to
his
hotel
in
a
hay
wagon
this
was
their
way
of
making
fun
of
douglas
and
his
fine
manners
senator
douglas
was
an
eloquent
orator
while
he
was
talking
some
of
abe
friends
would
worry
would
old
abe
be
able
to
answer
would
he
be
able
to
hold
his
own
then
abe
would
unfold
his
long
legs
and
stand
up
the
giant
killer
towered
so
high
above
the
little
giant
that
a
titter
ran
through
the
crowd
when
he
came
to
the
serious
part
of
his
speech
there
was
silence
his
voice
reached
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
crowd
as
he
reminded
them
what
slavery
really
meant
he
summed
it
up
in
a
few
words
you
work
and
toil
and
earn
bread
and
i
eat
it
both
men
worked
hard
to
be
elected
and
douglas
won
i
feel
like
the
boy
said
abe
who
stubbed
his
toe
it
hurts
too
bad
to
laugh
and
i
am
too
big
to
cry
all
of
those
who
loved
him
mary
his
wife
in
her
neat
white
house
sarah
his
stepmother
in
her
little
cabin
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
and
his
many
friends
were
disappointed
but
not
for
long
the
part
he
took
in
the
debates
made
his
name
known
throughout
the
united
states
abe
lincoln
chance
was
coming
illustration
during
the
next
two
years
abraham
lincoln
was
asked
to
make
many
speeches
let
us
have
faith
that
right
makes
might
he
told
one
audience
in
new
york
and
in
that
faith
let
us
to
the
end
dare
to
do
our
duty
as
we
understand
it
at
the
end
of
the
speech
several
thousand
people
rose
to
their
feet
cheering
and
waving
their
handkerchiefs
his
words
were
printed
in
newspapers
throughout
the
northern
states
men
and
women
began
to
think
of
him
as
the
friend
of
freedom
by
he
was
so
well
known
that
he
was
nominated
for
president
of
the
united
states
stephen
douglas
was
nominated
by
another
political
party
once
more
the
two
rivals
were
running
for
the
same
office
several
thousands
of
abraham
lincoln
admirers
called
themselves
wide
awakes
there
were
wide
awake
clubs
in
near
every
northern
town
night
after
night
they
marched
in
parades
carrying
flaming
torches
and
colored
lanterns
and
as
they
marched
they
sang
hurrah
for
our
cause
of
all
causes
the
best
hurrah
for
old
abe
honest
abe
of
the
west
no
one
enjoyed
the
campaign
excitement
more
than
did
willie
and
tad
lincoln
they
did
their
marching
around
the
parlor
carpet
singing
another
song
old
abe
lincoln
came
out
of
the
wilderness
out
of
the
wilderness
out
of
the
wilderness
old
abe
lincoln
came
out
of
the
wilderness
down
in
illinois
people
everywhere
were
talking
about
old
abe
and
he
received
a
great
deal
of
mail
some
of
the
letters
came
from
pigeon
creek
nat
grigsby
his
old
schoolmate
wrote
that
his
indiana
friends
were
thinking
of
him
dave
turnham
wrote
it
was
in
dave
book
that
abe
had
first
read
the
declaration
of
independence
a
package
arrived
from
josiah
crawford
who
had
given
him
his
of
the
package
contained
a
piece
of
white
oak
wood
it
was
part
of
a
rail
that
abe
had
split
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
josiah
thought
that
he
might
like
to
have
it
made
into
a
cane
hundreds
of
other
letters
came
from
people
he
had
never
seen
one
from
new
york
state
made
him
smile
i
am
a
little
girl
only
eleven
years
old
the
letter
read
but
want
you
should
be
president
of
the
united
states
very
much
so
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
very
bold
to
write
to
such
a
great
man
as
you
are
i
have
got
four
brothers
and
part
of
them
will
vote
for
you
anyway
and
if
you
will
let
your
whiskers
grow
i
will
try
to
get
the
rest
of
them
to
vote
for
you
you
would
look
a
great
deal
better
for
your
face
is
so
thin
all
the
ladies
like
whiskers
and
they
would
tease
their
husbands
to
vote
for
you
and
then
you
would
be
president
the
letter
was
signed
grace
bedell
in
less
than
two
weeks
she
received
an
answer
abraham
lincoln
who
loved
children
took
her
advice
by
election
day
on
november
he
had
started
to
grow
a
beard
he
spent
the
evening
of
election
day
in
the
telegraph
office
report
after
report
came
in
from
different
parts
of
the
country
he
was
gaining
he
was
winning
after
a
while
he
knew
his
friends
knew
all
springfield
knew
that
abraham
lincoln
was
to
be
the
next
president
of
the
united
states
outside
in
the
streets
the
crowds
were
celebrating
they
were
singing
shouting
shooting
off
cannons
abe
told
his
friends
that
he
was
upset
with
joy
i
guess
i
better
go
home
now
he
added
there
is
a
little
woman
there
who
would
like
to
hear
the
news
mary
was
asleep
when
he
entered
their
bedroom
her
husband
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
mary
mary
he
said
with
a
low
chuckle
we
are
elected
by
february
the
lincolns
were
ready
to
move
abe
tied
up
the
trunks
and
addressed
them
to
lincoln
the
white
house
washington
before
he
left
illinois
there
was
a
visit
he
wanted
to
make
to
a
log
farmhouse
a
hundred
and
miles
southeast
of
springfield
his
father
had
been
dead
for
ten
years
but
his
stepmother
was
still
living
there
illustration
travel
was
slow
in
those
days
and
he
had
to
change
trains
several
times
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
think
he
knew
that
hard
days
lay
ahead
there
were
many
southerners
who
said
that
they
were
afraid
to
live
under
a
president
who
was
against
slavery
several
southern
states
had
left
the
union
and
were
starting
a
country
of
their
own
for
the
united
states
to
be
broken
up
into
two
different
nations
seemed
to
him
the
saddest
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
as
president
abraham
lincoln
would
have
a
chance
he
must
make
the
chance
to
preserve
the
union
he
could
not
know
then
that
he
would
also
have
a
chance
to
free
the
slaves
a
chance
to
serve
his
country
as
had
no
other
president
since
george
washington
his
thoughts
went
back
to
his
boyhood
even
then
he
had
wanted
to
be
president
what
had
once
seemed
an
impossible
dream
was
coming
true
he
thought
of
all
the
people
who
had
encouraged
and
helped
him
he
thought
of
his
mother
who
more
than
any
one
person
had
given
him
a
chance
to
get
ahead
mother
whenever
abe
said
the
word
he
was
thinking
of
both
nancy
and
sarah
sarah
was
waiting
by
the
window
a
tall
man
in
a
high
silk
hat
came
striding
up
the
path
abe
you
come
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
up
into
the
sad
wise
face
of
course
mother
he
gave
her
the
kind
of
good
bear
hug
he
had
given
her
when
he
was
a
boy
i
am
leaving
soon
for
washington
did
you
think
i
could
go
so
far
away
without
saying
the
word
spread
rapidly
that
he
was
there
one
after
another
the
neighbors
dropped
in
until
the
little
room
was
crowded
as
he
sat
before
the
fireplace
talking
with
all
who
came
sarah
seemed
to
see
not
a
man
about
to
become
president
but
a
little
boy
she
had
loved
that
little
boy
from
the
moment
she
first
saw
him
he
had
always
been
a
good
son
to
her
a
better
son
than
her
own
john
when
the
last
visitor
had
gone
she
drew
her
chair
closer
it
was
good
to
have
a
few
minutes
alone
together
abe
she
told
him
i
can
say
what
scarcely
one
mother
in
a
thousand
can
say
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
you
never
gave
me
a
cross
word
in
your
life
i
reckon
your
mind
and
mine
that
is
she
laughed
embarrassed
what
little
mind
i
had
seemed
to
run
together
he
reached
over
and
laid
a
big
hand
on
her
knee
she
put
her
wrinkled
hand
on
his
when
the
time
came
to
say
she
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
will
i
ever
see
you
again
she
asked
what
if
something
should
happen
to
you
abe
i
feel
