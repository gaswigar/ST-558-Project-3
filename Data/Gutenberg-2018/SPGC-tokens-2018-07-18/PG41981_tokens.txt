printed
in
the
waves
flung
up
against
the
purple
glow
of
double
sleeplessness
along
the
piers
the
ships
return
but
sailing
i
would
go
through
double
rings
of
fire
double
fears
so
therefore
let
your
bright
vaults
heave
the
night
about
with
ropes
of
wind
and
points
of
light
and
say
as
all
the
rolling
stars
go
i
have
stood
my
feet
on
rock
and
seen
the
sky
these
are
the
opening
lines
from
by
the
poet
geo
the
epic
of
the
conflicts
of
leptar
and
aptor
prologue
afterwards
she
was
taken
down
to
the
sea
she
did
feel
too
well
so
she
sat
on
a
rock
down
where
the
sand
was
wet
and
scrunched
her
bare
toes
in
and
out
of
the
cool
surface
she
turned
away
looked
toward
the
water
and
hunched
her
shoulders
a
little
i
think
it
was
awful
she
said
i
think
it
was
pretty
terrible
why
did
you
show
it
to
me
he
was
just
a
little
boy
what
reason
could
they
have
possibly
had
for
doing
that
to
him
it
was
just
a
film
he
said
we
showed
it
to
you
so
you
would
learn
but
it
was
a
film
of
something
that
really
happened
it
happened
several
years
ago
several
hundred
miles
away
but
it
did
happen
you
used
a
tight
beam
to
spy
on
them
and
when
the
image
came
in
on
the
vision
screen
you
made
a
film
of
it
and
but
why
did
you
show
it
to
me
what
have
we
been
teaching
you
but
she
could
think
and
only
had
the
picture
in
her
mind
vivid
movements
scarlets
and
bright
agony
he
was
just
a
child
she
said
he
could
have
been
more
than
eleven
or
twelve
you
are
just
a
child
he
said
you
are
not
sixteen
yet
what
was
i
supposed
to
learn
look
around
you
he
said
you
should
see
something
but
the
picture
in
her
mind
was
still
too
vivid
too
bright
you
should
be
able
to
learn
it
right
here
on
this
beach
in
the
trees
back
there
in
the
rocks
in
the
bleached
shells
around
your
feet
you
do
see
it
you
just
do
recognize
it
suddenly
he
changed
his
tone
actually
you
a
very
fine
student
you
learn
quickly
do
you
remember
anything
about
telepathy
you
studied
it
months
ago
a
method
similar
to
radio
broadcast
and
reception
she
recited
synapse
patterns
of
conscious
thoughts
are
read
from
one
cranial
cortex
and
duplicated
in
another
resulting
in
similar
sensual
impressions
experienced
suddenly
she
broke
off
but
i
ca
do
it
so
it
does
help
me
any
what
about
history
then
he
said
you
did
extremely
well
during
the
examination
what
good
does
knowing
about
all
the
happenings
in
the
world
before
and
after
the
great
fire
do
you
well
it
she
started
it
just
interesting
the
film
you
saw
he
said
was
in
a
way
history
that
is
it
happened
in
the
past
but
it
was
so
again
she
horrible
does
history
fascinate
you
because
it
just
interesting
he
asked
or
does
it
do
something
else
do
you
ever
want
to
know
what
the
reason
is
behind
some
of
the
things
these
people
do
in
the
pages
of
the
books
yes
i
want
to
know
the
reasons
she
said
like
i
want
to
know
the
reason
they
nailed
that
man
to
the
oaken
cross
i
want
to
know
why
they
did
that
to
him
a
good
question
he
mused
which
reminds
me
at
about
the
same
time
as
they
were
nailing
him
to
that
cross
it
was
decided
in
china
that
the
forces
of
the
universe
were
to
be
represented
by
a
circle
half
black
half
white
but
to
remind
themselves
that
there
was
no
pure
force
no
purely
unique
reason
they
put
a
spot
of
white
paint
in
the
black
half
and
a
spot
of
black
paint
in
the
white
is
that
interesting
she
looked
at
him
and
wondered
how
he
had
gotten
from
one
to
the
other
but
he
was
going
on
and
do
you
remember
the
goldsmith
the
lover
how
he
recorded
in
his
autobiography
that
at
age
four
he
and
his
father
saw
the
fabulous
salamander
on
their
hearth
by
the
fire
and
his
father
suddenly
smacked
the
boy
ten
feet
across
the
room
into
a
rack
of
kettles
saying
something
to
the
effect
that
little
cellini
was
too
young
to
remember
the
incident
unless
some
pain
accompanied
it
i
remember
that
story
she
said
and
i
remember
that
cellini
said
that
he
was
sure
if
the
smack
was
the
reason
he
remembered
the
salamander
or
the
salamander
the
reason
he
remembered
the
smack
yes
yes
he
cried
that
it
the
reason
the
reasons
do
you
see
the
pattern
only
i
do
know
what
a
salamander
is
she
told
him
well
it
like
the
blue
lizards
that
sing
outside
your
window
sometimes
he
explained
only
it
is
blue
and
it
does
sing
then
why
should
anyone
want
to
remember
it
she
grinned
it
was
an
attempt
to
annoy
him
but
he
was
not
looking
at
her
and
was
talking
of
something
else
and
the
painter
he
was
saying
he
was
a
friend
of
cellini
you
remember
in
florence
he
was
painting
a
picture
of
la
gioconda
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
to
take
time
from
the
already
crumbling
picture
of
the
last
supper
of
the
man
who
was
nailed
to
the
cross
of
oak
to
paint
her
and
he
put
a
smile
on
her
face
of
which
men
asked
for
centuries
is
the
reason
she
smiles
so
strangely
yes
the
reason
do
you
see
just
look
around
what
about
the
great
fire
she
asked
when
they
dropped
flames
from
the
skies
and
the
harbors
boiled
that
was
reasonless
that
was
like
what
they
did
to
that
boy
oh
no
he
said
to
her
not
reasonless
true
when
the
great
fire
came
people
all
over
the
earth
screamed
why
how
can
man
do
this
to
man
what
is
the
reason
but
just
look
around
you
right
here
on
this
beach
i
guess
i
ca
see
it
yet
she
said
i
can
just
see
what
they
did
to
him
and
it
was
awful
well
said
the
man
in
the
dark
robe
perhaps
when
you
stop
seeing
what
they
did
so
vividly
you
will
start
seeing
why
they
did
it
i
think
it
time
for
us
to
go
back
now
as
she
slid
off
the
rock
and
started
walking
beside
him
barefooted
in
the
sand
she
asked
that
boy
i
was
sure
he
was
all
tied
up
but
he
had
four
arms
did
he
he
did
you
know
i
ca
just
go
around
saying
it
was
awful
i
think
i
going
to
write
a
poem
or
make
something
or
both
i
got
to
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
would
be
a
bad
idea
he
mumbled
as
they
approached
the
trees
in
front
of
the
river
not
at
all
and
several
days
later
and
several
hundred
miles
away
chapter
i
waves
flung
themselves
at
the
blue
evening
low
light
burned
on
the
wet
hulks
of
ships
that
slipped
by
mossy
pilings
into
the
docks
as
water
sloshed
at
the
rotten
stone
embankment
of
the
city
gangplanks
chained
from
wooden
pullies
scraped
into
place
on
concrete
blocks
and
the
crew
after
the
slow
captain
and
the
tall
mate
descended
raffishly
along
the
wooden
boards
which
sagged
with
the
pounding
of
bare
feet
in
bawling
groups
pairs
or
singly
they
howled
into
the
narrow
waterfront
streets
into
the
yellow
light
from
open
inn
doors
the
purple
shadowed
portals
leading
to
dim
rooms
full
of
blue
smoke
and
stench
of
burnt
poppies
the
captain
with
eyes
the
color
of
sea
under
fog
touched
his
sword
hilt
with
his
fist
and
said
quietly
to
the
mate
well
they
gone
we
better
start
collecting
new
sailors
for
the
ten
we
lost
at
aptor
ten
good
men
jordde
i
sick
when
i
think
of
the
bone
and
broken
meat
they
became
ten
for
the
dead
sneered
the
mate
and
twenty
for
the
living
never
see
again
any
sailor
that
would
want
to
continue
this
trip
with
us
is
insane
we
do
well
if
we
only
lose
that
many
he
was
a
tall
wire
bound
man
which
made
the
green
tunic
he
wore
look
baggy
i
never
forgive
her
for
ordering
us
to
that
monstrous
island
said
the
captain
i
would
speak
too
loudly
mumbled
the
mate
yours
is
to
forgive
her
besides
she
went
with
them
and
was
in
as
much
danger
as
they
were
it
only
luck
she
came
back
suddenly
the
captain
asked
do
you
believe
the
sailor
stories
of
magic
they
tell
of
her
why
sir
asked
the
mate
do
you
no
i
do
said
the
captain
with
a
certainty
that
came
too
quickly
still
with
three
survivors
out
of
thirteen
that
she
should
be
among
them
with
hardly
a
robe
torn
perhaps
they
would
touch
a
woman
suggested
the
mate
jordde
perhaps
said
the
captain
and
she
been
strange
continued
jordde
ever
since
then
she
walks
at
night
i
seen
her
going
by
the
rails
looking
from
the
to
the
stars
and
then
back
ten
good
men
mused
the
captain
hacked
up
torn
in
bits
i
have
believed
that
much
barbarity
in
the
world
if
i
had
seen
that
arm
floating
on
the
water
it
gives
me
chills
now
the
way
the
men
ran
to
the
rail
to
see
pointed
at
it
and
it
just
raised
itself
up
like
a
beckoning
a
signal
and
then
sank
in
a
wash
of
foam
and
green
water
well
said
the
mate
we
have
men
to
get
i
wonder
if
she
come
ashore
she
come
if
she
wants
captain
her
doing
is
no
concern
of
yours
your
job
is
the
ship
and
to
do
what
she
says
i
have
more
of
a
job
than
that
and
he
looked
back
at
his
still
craft
the
mate
touched
the
captain
shoulder
if
you
going
to
speak
things
like
that
speak
them
softly
and
only
to
me
i
have
more
of
a
job
than
that
the
captain
repeated
then
suddenly
he
started
away
and
the
mate
was
following
him
down
the
darkening
dockside
street
the
dock
was
still
for
a
moment
then
a
barrel
toppled
from
a
pile
of
barrels
and
a
figure
moved
like
a
bird
shadow
across
the
opening
between
mounds
of
cargo
set
about
the
pier
at
the
same
time
two
men
approached
down
a
narrow
street
filled
with
the
day
last
light
the
bigger
one
threw
a
great
shadow
that
aped
his
gesticulating
arms
behind
him
on
the
greenish
faces
of
the
buildings
bare
feet
like
halved
hams
shins
bound
with
thongs
and
pelts
he
waved
one
hand
in
explanation
while
he
rubbed
the
back
of
the
other
on
his
short
mahogany
beard
you
going
to
ship
out
eh
friend
you
think
they
take
your
rhymes
and
jingles
instead
of
muscles
and
rope
pulling
the
smaller
in
a
white
tunic
looped
with
a
thick
leather
belt
laughed
beneath
his
friend
rantings
fifteen
minutes
ago
you
thought
it
was
a
fine
idea
said
it
would
make
me
a
man
oh
it
a
life
to
make
his
hand
went
up
and
it
a
life
to
break
men
and
it
fell
the
slighter
one
pushed
back
black
hair
from
his
forehead
stopped
and
looked
at
the
ships
you
still
have
told
me
why
no
ship
has
taken
you
on
in
the
past
three
months
he
said
absently
following
the
rope
rigging
against
the
sky
like
black
knife
slashes
on
blue
silk
a
year
ago
i
never
see
you
in
for
more
than
three
days
at
once
the
gesticulating
arm
suddenly
encircled
the
smaller
man
waist
and
lifted
a
leather
pouch
from
the
wide
belt
are
you
sure
friend
geo
began
the
giant
that
we
could
use
up
some
of
this
silver
on
wine
before
we
go
if
you
want
to
do
this
right
then
right
is
how
it
should
be
done
when
you
sign
up
on
a
ship
you
supposed
to
be
broke
and
a
little
tight
it
shows
that
you
capable
of
getting
along
without
the
inconvenience
of
money
and
can
hold
your
liquor
too
urson
get
your
paw
off
that
geo
snatched
the
purse
away
now
here
countered
urson
reaching
for
it
once
more
you
do
have
to
grab
look
i
kept
you
drunk
five
nights
now
and
it
time
to
sober
up
and
suppose
they
do
take
us
who
going
but
urson
the
idea
having
taken
the
glow
of
a
game
made
another
swipe
with
his
big
hand
geo
leapt
back
with
the
purse
now
cut
that
out
he
began
but
in
leaping
his
feet
struck
the
fallen
barrel
and
he
fell
backwards
to
the
wet
cobbles
the
pouch
splattered
away
jingling
both
of
them
scrambled
then
the
bird
shadow
moved
in
the
opening
between
the
cargo
piles
a
slight
figure
bounded
forward
swept
the
purse
up
with
one
hand
pushed
himself
away
from
the
pile
of
cargo
with
another
and
there
were
two
more
fists
pumping
at
his
side
as
he
ran
what
the
devil
began
urson
and
then
what
the
hey
you
called
geo
lurching
to
his
feet
come
back
and
urson
had
already
loped
a
couple
of
steps
after
the
fleeting
mutant
now
halfway
down
the
block
suddenly
from
behind
them
like
a
stem
snapping
only
twenty
times
as
loud
a
voice
called
stop
little
thief
stop
the
running
form
stopped
as
though
it
had
hit
a
wall
come
back
now
come
back
the
figure
turned
and
docilely
started
back
the
movements
so
lithe
and
swift
a
moment
ago
now
mechanical
it
just
a
kid
urson
said
he
was
a
boy
naked
except
for
a
ragged
breech
he
approached
staring
fixedly
beyond
them
toward
the
boats
and
he
had
four
arms
now
they
turned
and
looked
also
she
stood
at
the
base
of
the
ship
gangplank
against
what
sun
still
washed
the
horizon
one
hand
held
something
close
at
her
throat
and
wind
caught
in
a
veil
held
the
purple
gauze
against
the
red
swath
at
the
world
edge
and
then
dropped
it
the
boy
like
an
automaton
approached
her
give
that
to
me
little
thief
she
said
he
handed
her
the
purse
she
took
it
and
then
suddenly
dropped
her
other
hand
from
her
neck
the
moment
she
did
so
the
boy
staggered
backwards
turned
and
ran
straight
into
urson
who
said
ooof
and
then
god
damn
little
spider
the
boy
struggled
to
get
away
like
a
hydra
in
furious
silence
but
urson
held
you
stick
around
owww
to
get
yourself
thrashed
there
the
boy
got
turned
his
back
to
the
giant
one
arm
locked
across
his
neck
and
the
other
hand
holding
all
four
wrists
lifted
up
hard
enough
so
that
the
body
shook
like
wires
jerked
taut
but
he
was
still
silent
now
the
woman
came
across
the
dock
this
belongs
to
you
gentlemen
she
asked
extending
the
purse
thank
you
grunted
urson
reaching
forward
i
take
it
said
geo
intercepting
then
he
recited
melt
in
light
of
sacred
laughter
hands
and
houses
shall
be
one
many
thanks
he
added
beneath
the
veil
on
her
shadowed
face
her
eyebrows
raised
you
have
been
schooled
in
courtly
rites
she
observed
him
are
you
perhaps
a
student
at
the
university
geo
smiled
i
was
until
a
short
time
ago
but
funds
are
low
and
i
have
to
get
through
the
summer
somehow
i
going
to
sea
honorable
but
perhaps
foolish
i
am
a
poet
they
say
poets
are
fools
besides
my
friend
here
says
the
sea
will
make
a
man
of
me
to
be
a
good
poet
one
must
be
a
good
man
more
honorable
less
foolish
what
sort
of
a
man
is
your
friend
my
name
is
urson
said
the
giant
stepping
up
i
been
the
best
hand
on
any
ship
i
sailed
on
urson
said
the
woman
musing
the
bear
i
thought
bears
did
not
like
water
except
polar
bears
it
makes
them
mad
i
believe
there
was
an
old
spell
in
antiquity
for
taming
angry
bears
brother
bear
geo
began
to
recite
the
winter
sleep
fire
shall
not
harm
water
not
alarm
while
the
current
grows
amber
honey
flaws
golden
salmon
hey
said
urson
i
not
a
bear
your
name
means
bear
geo
said
then
to
the
lady
you
see
i
have
been
well
trained
i
afraid
i
have
not
she
replied
poetry
and
rituals
were
a
hobby
of
a
year
passing
interest
when
i
was
younger
but
that
was
all
now
she
looked
down
at
the
boy
whom
urson
still
held
you
two
look
alike
dark
eyes
dark
hair
she
laughed
are
there
other
things
in
common
between
poets
and
thieves
well
complained
urson
with
a
jerk
of
his
chin
this
one
here
spare
a
few
silvers
for
a
drink
of
good
wine
to
wet
his
best
throat
and
that
a
sort
of
thievery
if
you
ask
me
i
did
not
ask
said
the
woman
quietly
urson
huffed
little
thief
the
woman
said
little
four
arms
what
is
your
name
silence
and
the
dark
eyes
narrowed
i
can
make
you
tell
me
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
throat
again
now
the
eyes
opened
wide
and
the
boy
pushed
back
against
urson
belly
geo
reached
toward
the
boy
neck
where
a
ceramic
disk
hung
from
a
leather
thong
glazed
on
the
white
enamel
was
a
wriggle
of
black
with
a
small
dot
of
green
for
an
eye
at
one
end
this
will
do
for
a
name
geo
said
no
need
to
harm
him
snake
is
his
symbol
snake
shall
be
his
name
little
snake
she
said
dropping
her
threatening
hand
how
good
a
thief
are
you
she
looked
at
urson
let
him
go
and
miss
thrashing
his
backside
objected
urson
he
will
not
run
away
urson
released
him
and
four
hands
came
from
behind
the
boy
back
and
began
massaging
one
another
wrists
but
the
dark
eyes
watched
her
until
she
repeated
how
good
a
thief
are
you
with
only
a
second
indecision
he
reached
into
his
clout
and
drew
out
what
seemed
another
leather
thong
similar
to
the
one
around
his
neck
he
held
up
the
fist
from
which
it
dangled
and
the
fingers
opened
slowly
to
a
cage
what
is
it
urson
asked
peering
over
snake
shoulder
the
woman
gazed
forward
then
suddenly
stood
straight
you
she
began
snake
fist
closed
like
a
you
are
a
fine
thief
indeed
what
is
it
urson
asked
i
did
see
anything
show
them
she
said
snake
opened
his
hand
and
on
the
dirty
palm
in
coiled
leather
held
by
a
clumsy
wire
cage
was
a
milky
sphere
the
size
of
a
man
eye
lucent
through
the
shadow
a
very
fine
thief
indeed
repeated
the
woman
in
a
low
voice
tautened
strangely
from
its
previous
brittle
clarity
she
had
pulled
her
veil
aside
now
and
geo
saw
where
her
hand
had
again
raised
to
her
throat
the
tips
of
her
slim
fingers
held
an
identical
jewel
only
this
one
in
a
platinum
claw
hung
from
a
wrought
gold
chain
her
eyes
unveiled
black
as
obsidian
raised
to
meet
geo
a
slight
smile
lifted
her
pale
mouth
and
then
fell
again
no
she
said
not
quite
so
clever
as
i
thought
at
first
i
believed
he
had
taken
mine
but
clever
enough
clever
enough
you
schooled
in
the
antiquity
of
rituals
are
you
clever
enough
to
tell
me
what
these
baubles
mean
geo
shook
his
head
a
breath
passed
her
pale
mouth
now
and
though
her
eyes
still
fixed
his
she
seemed
to
draw
away
blown
into
some
past
shadow
by
her
own
sigh
no
she
said
it
has
all
been
lost
or
destroyed
by
the
old
priests
and
priestesses
the
old
poets
the
drop
in
the
hand
and
break
the
earth
with
singing
hail
the
height
of
a
man
and
also
the
height
of
a
eyes
have
imprisoned
a
she
spoke
the
lines
almost
reverently
do
you
recognize
any
of
this
can
you
tell
me
where
they
are
from
only
one
stanza
of
it
said
geo
and
that
in
a
slightly
different
form
he
recited
the
grain
speck
in
the
hand
and
batter
the
stars
with
singing
hail
the
height
of
a
man
and
also
the
height
of
a
well
said
the
woman
you
have
done
better
than
all
the
priests
and
priestesses
of
leptar
what
about
this
fragment
where
is
it
from
it
is
a
stanza
of
the
discarded
rituals
of
the
goddess
argo
the
ones
banned
and
destroyed
five
hundred
years
ago
the
rest
of
the
poem
is
completely
lost
explained
geo
i
found
that
stanza
when
i
peeled
away
the
binding
paper
of
an
ancient
tome
that
i
found
in
the
antiquity
collection
in
the
temple
library
at
acedia
apparently
a
page
from
an
even
older
book
had
been
used
in
the
binding
of
this
one
i
assume
these
are
fragments
of
the
rituals
before
leptar
purged
her
litanies
i
know
at
least
my
variant
stanza
belongs
to
that
period
perhaps
you
have
received
a
misquoted
rendition
for
i
will
vouch
for
the
authenticity
of
mine
no
she
said
almost
regretfully
mine
is
the
authentic
version
so
you
too
are
not
that
clever
she
turned
back
to
the
boy
but
i
have
need
of
a
good
thief
will
you
come
with
me
and
you
poet
i
have
need
of
one
who
thinks
so
meticulously
and
who
delves
into
places
where
even
my
priests
and
priestesses
do
not
go
will
you
come
with
me
where
are
we
going
aboard
that
ship
she
said
smiling
toward
the
vessel
that
a
good
boat
said
urson
i
be
proud
to
sail
on
her
geo
the
captain
is
in
my
service
the
woman
told
geo
he
will
take
you
on
perhaps
you
will
get
a
chance
to
see
the
world
and
become
the
man
you
wish
to
be
geo
saw
that
urson
was
beginning
to
look
uneasy
and
said
my
friend
goes
on
whatever
ship
i
do
this
we
promised
each
other
besides
he
is
a
good
sailor
while
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
sea
on
our
last
journey
the
woman
explained
we
lost
men
i
do
not
think
your
friend
will
have
trouble
getting
a
berth
then
we
be
honored
to
come
said
geo
under
whose
service
shall
we
be
then
for
we
still
do
know
who
you
are
now
the
veil
fell
across
her
face
again
i
am
a
high
priestess
of
the
goddess
argo
now
who
are
you
my
name
is
geo
geo
told
her
of
the
earth
then
your
name
she
said
and
you
urson
the
bear
and
lamio
the
little
snake
i
welcome
you
aboard
our
ship
just
then
from
down
the
street
came
the
captain
and
the
mate
jordde
they
emerged
from
the
diagonal
of
shadow
that
lanced
over
the
cobbles
slowly
heavily
the
captain
squinted
out
across
the
ships
toward
the
horizon
the
copper
light
filling
his
deepening
wrinkles
and
burnishing
the
planes
of
flesh
around
his
gray
eyes
as
they
approached
the
priestess
turned
to
them
captain
i
have
three
men
as
a
token
replacement
at
least
for
the
ones
my
folly
helped
lose
urson
geo
and
snake
looked
at
each
other
and
then
toward
the
captain
jordde
looked
at
all
three
you
seem
strong
the
captain
said
to
urson
a
man
but
this
one
and
he
looked
at
snake
now
one
of
the
strange
ones
they
bad
luck
on
a
ship
interrupted
the
mate
most
ships
take
them
at
all
this
one
just
a
boy
and
for
all
his
spindles
there
could
haul
rope
or
reef
sails
he
be
no
good
to
us
at
all
and
we
had
too
much
bad
luck
already
he
not
for
rope
pulling
laughed
the
priestess
the
little
snake
is
my
guest
the
others
you
can
put
to
ship
work
i
know
you
are
short
of
men
but
i
have
my
own
plans
for
this
one
as
you
say
said
the
captain
but
priestess
began
jordde
as
you
say
repeated
the
captain
and
the
mate
stepped
back
quieted
the
captain
turned
to
geo
now
and
who
are
you
he
asked
i
geo
before
and
still
a
poet
but
i
do
what
work
you
set
me
sir
and
you
jordde
asked
urson
i
a
good
of
the
waves
can
stand
triple
watch
without
flagging
and
i
believe
i
already
hired
he
looked
to
the
captain
but
what
do
they
call
you
jordde
asked
you
have
a
familiar
look
like
one
i
had
under
me
before
they
call
me
the
handsome
sailor
the
fastest
rope
reeler
the
quickest
line
hauler
the
speediest
sheaf
reefer
your
name
man
your
name
jordde
demanded
some
call
me
urson
that
the
name
i
knew
you
by
before
do
you
think
i
sail
with
you
again
when
i
myself
put
it
in
black
and
white
and
sent
it
to
every
captain
and
mate
in
the
dock
for
three
months
now
you
had
no
berth
and
if
you
had
none
for
three
hundred
years
it
would
be
too
soon
jordde
turned
to
the
captain
now
he
a
troublemaker
sir
a
though
he
as
wild
as
waves
and
with
the
strength
of
mizzen
spars
spirit
in
a
man
is
one
thing
and
a
fight
or
two
the
same
but
good
sailor
though
he
be
i
sworn
not
to
have
him
on
ship
with
me
sir
he
nearly
murdered
half
a
dozen
men
and
probably
has
murdered
half
a
dozen
more
no
mate
who
knows
the
men
of
this
harbor
will
take
him
on
the
priestess
of
argo
laughed
captain
take
him
now
she
looked
at
geo
the
words
for
calming
the
angry
bear
have
been
recited
before
him
now
geo
we
will
see
how
good
a
poet
you
are
and
if
the
spell
works
at
last
she
turned
toward
urson
have
you
ever
killed
a
man
urson
was
silent
a
moment
i
have
had
you
told
me
that
said
the
priestess
i
would
have
chosen
you
first
i
have
need
of
you
also
captain
you
must
take
him
if
he
is
a
good
sailor
then
we
can
not
spare
him
i
will
channel
what
special
talents
he
may
have
geo
since
you
said
the
spell
and
are
his
friend
i
charge
you
with
his
control
also
i
wish
to
talk
with
you
poet
student
of
rituals
come
you
all
may
stay
on
board
ship
tonight
chapter
ii
an
oil
lamp
leaked
yellow
light
on
the
wooden
walls
of
the
forecastle
geo
wrinkled
his
nose
then
shrugged
well
said
urson
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
hole
he
climbed
one
of
the
tiers
of
bunked
beds
and
pounded
the
ticking
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
here
i
take
this
one
little
wriggly
arms
you
look
like
you
have
a
strong
stomach
so
you
take
the
middle
and
geo
sling
yourself
down
in
the
bottom
there
he
clumped
to
the
floor
again
the
lower
down
you
are
he
explained
the
better
you
sleep
because
of
the
rocking
well
what
do
you
think
of
your
first
forecastle
geo
the
poet
was
silent
as
he
turned
his
head
double
pins
of
light
struck
yellow
dots
in
his
dark
eyes
and
then
went
out
as
he
turned
from
the
lamp
i
put
you
in
the
bottom
because
a
little
rough
weather
can
unseat
your
belly
pretty
fast
if
you
up
near
the
ceiling
and
not
used
to
it
urson
expanded
dropping
his
hand
heavily
on
geo
shoulder
i
told
you
i
look
out
for
you
did
i
friend
but
geo
turned
away
and
seemed
to
examine
something
else
urson
looked
at
snake
now
who
was
watching
him
from
against
one
wall
urson
glance
was
puzzled
snake
only
silent
hey
urson
spoke
to
geo
once
more
let
you
and
me
take
a
run
around
this
ship
and
see
what
tied
down
where
a
good
sailor
does
that
first
thing
unless
he
too
drunk
but
that
lets
the
captain
and
the
mate
know
he
got
an
alert
eye
out
and
sometimes
he
can
learn
something
that
will
ease
some
later
on
what
do
you
say
not
now
urson
interrupted
geo
you
go
and
would
you
please
tell
me
why
my
company
suddenly
is
good
enough
for
you
this
sudden
silence
is
a
bilgy
way
to
treat
somebody
sworn
himself
to
see
that
you
make
the
best
first
voyage
that
a
man
could
have
why
i
think
when
did
you
kill
a
man
geo
suddenly
turned
the
giant
stood
still
his
hands
twisting
into
double
knots
of
bone
and
muscle
then
they
opened
maybe
it
was
a
year
ago
he
said
softly
and
maybe
it
was
a
year
two
months
and
five
days
on
a
thursday
morning
at
eight
in
the
brig
of
a
heaving
ship
which
would
make
it
about
five
days
and
ten
hours
how
could
you
kill
a
man
geo
asked
how
could
you
go
for
a
year
and
not
tell
me
about
it
and
then
admit
it
to
a
stranger
just
like
that
you
were
my
friend
we
slept
under
the
same
blanket
drank
from
the
same
wineskin
but
what
sort
of
a
person
are
you
and
what
sort
of
a
person
are
you
said
the
giant
a
nosy
bastard
that
i
break
in
seven
pieces
if
he
heaved
in
a
breadth
if
i
had
promised
i
make
no
trouble
i
never
broken
a
promise
to
anyone
alive
or
dead
the
fists
formed
relaxed
again
suddenly
he
raised
one
hand
flung
it
away
and
spat
on
the
floor
then
he
turned
toward
the
steps
to
the
door
then
the
noise
hit
them
they
both
turned
toward
snake
the
boy
black
eyes
darted
under
twin
spots
of
light
from
the
lamp
to
urson
to
geo
then
back
the
noise
came
again
quieter
this
time
and
recognizable
as
the
word
only
it
was
no
sound
but
like
the
fading
hum
of
a
tuning
fork
inside
their
skulls
immediate
yet
fuzzy
you
help
me
came
the
words
once
more
indistinct
and
blurring
into
one
another
hey
urson
said
is
that
you
do
not
came
the
words
we
not
angry
geo
said
what
are
you
doing
were
the
words
that
seemed
to
generate
from
the
boy
now
what
sort
of
a
way
to
think
is
that
if
everyone
can
hear
it
demanded
urson
snake
tried
to
explain
everyone
just
you
you
think
i
hear
came
the
sound
again
think
you
i
know
we
hear
urson
said
it
just
like
you
were
talking
that
not
what
he
means
geo
said
he
means
he
hears
what
we
think
just
like
we
hear
him
is
that
right
snake
you
think
loud
i
i
may
just
have
been
doing
some
pretty
loud
thinking
urson
said
and
if
i
thought
something
i
was
supposed
to
well
i
apologize
snake
did
seem
interested
in
the
apology
but
asked
again
help
me
what
sort
of
help
do
you
want
geo
asked
and
what
sort
of
trouble
are
you
in
that
you
need
help
out
of
it
added
urson
do
have
good
snake
said
what
that
supposed
to
mean
urson
asked
our
minds
are
as
good
as
any
in
leptar
you
heard
the
way
the
priestess
talked
to
my
friend
the
poet
here
i
think
he
means
we
do
hear
very
well
said
geo
snake
nodded
oh
urson
said
well
then
you
just
have
to
go
slow
and
be
patient
with
us
snake
shook
his
head
hoarse
when
shout
so
suddenly
he
went
over
to
the
bunks
hear
better
see
too
if
sleep
is
sort
of
far
from
me
urson
said
rubbing
his
beard
with
the
back
of
his
wrist
me
too
geo
admitted
ca
you
tell
us
something
more
snake
said
what
about
talking
like
an
ordinary
human
being
suggested
urson
still
somewhat
perplexed
snake
told
them
you
say
you
could
speak
once
asked
geo
what
happened
here
the
boy
opened
his
mouth
and
pointed
geo
stepped
forward
held
the
boy
chin
in
his
hand
and
examined
the
face
and
peered
into
the
mouth
by
the
goddess
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
urson
asked
geo
came
away
now
his
face
lined
in
a
sickly
frown
his
tongue
has
been
hacked
out
he
told
the
giant
and
not
too
neatly
either
who
on
the
seven
seas
and
six
continents
did
a
thing
like
that
to
you
boy
urson
demanded
snake
shook
his
head
now
come
on
snake
he
urged
you
ca
keep
secrets
like
that
from
friends
and
expect
them
to
rescue
you
from
i
do
know
what
now
who
was
it
hacked
your
voice
away
man
you
kill
came
the
sound
urson
stopped
and
then
he
laughed
all
right
he
said
i
see
his
voice
rose
once
more
but
if
you
can
hear
thoughts
you
know
the
man
already
and
you
know
the
reason
and
this
is
what
we
find
out
of
you
and
only
for
help
and
friendship
sake
know
the
snake
said
geo
and
urson
exchanged
puzzled
frowns
said
snake
sleep
maybe
we
ought
to
try
said
geo
and
find
out
what
going
on
he
crossed
to
his
bunk
and
slipped
in
urson
followed
and
hoisted
himself
onto
the
upper
berth
dangling
his
feet
against
the
wooden
support
it
going
to
be
a
long
time
before
sleep
gets
to
me
tonight
he
said
you
know
the
rituals
and
about
magic
are
the
strange
ones
some
sort
of
magic
the
only
mention
of
them
in
rituals
says
that
they
are
ashes
of
the
great
fire
the
great
fire
was
back
before
the
purges
the
ones
i
spoke
to
the
priestess
about
so
i
do
know
anything
more
about
them
sailors
have
stories
of
the
great
fire
urson
said
they
say
the
sea
boiled
great
birds
spat
fire
from
the
sky
and
beasts
rose
up
from
the
waves
and
destroyed
the
harbors
but
what
were
the
purges
you
mentioned
about
five
hundred
years
ago
geo
explained
all
the
rituals
of
the
goddess
argo
were
destroyed
a
completely
new
set
were
initiated
into
the
temple
practices
all
references
to
them
were
destroyed
also
and
with
them
much
of
leptar
history
stories
have
it
that
the
rituals
and
incantations
were
too
powerful
but
this
is
just
a
guess
and
most
priests
are
very
uncomfortable
about
speculating
that
was
after
the
great
fire
urson
asked
nearly
a
thousand
years
after
geo
said
it
must
have
been
a
great
fire
indeed
if
ashes
from
it
are
still
falling
from
the
wombs
of
healthy
women
he
looked
down
at
snake
is
it
true
that
a
drop
of
your
blood
in
vinegar
will
cure
gout
if
one
of
you
kisses
a
female
baby
will
she
have
only
girl
children
he
laughed
you
know
those
are
only
tales
geo
said
there
used
to
be
a
one
with
two
heads
that
sat
outside
the
blue
tavern
and
spun
a
top
all
day
it
was
an
idiot
though
but
the
dwarfs
and
the
legless
ones
that
wheel
about
the
city
and
do
tricks
they
are
clever
but
strange
and
quiet
usually
you
oaf
chided
geo
you
could
be
one
too
how
many
men
do
you
know
who
reach
your
size
and
strength
by
normal
means
you
a
crazy
liar
said
urson
then
he
scrunched
his
eyebrows
together
in
thought
and
at
last
shrugged
well
anyway
i
never
heard
of
one
who
could
hear
what
you
thought
it
would
make
me
uncomfortable
walking
down
the
street
he
looked
down
at
snake
between
his
legs
can
you
all
do
that
snake
from
the
middle
bunk
shook
his
head
urson
stretched
out
on
his
back
but
then
suddenly
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
berth
toward
geo
hey
geo
what
about
those
little
baubles
she
had
do
you
know
what
they
are
no
i
do
geo
said
but
she
was
concerned
over
them
enough
he
looked
up
over
the
bunk
bottom
between
himself
and
urson
snake
will
you
give
me
another
look
at
that
thing
snake
held
out
the
thong
and
the
jewel
where
did
you
get
it
urson
asked
oh
never
mind
i
guess
we
learn
that
when
we
go
to
sleep
geo
reached
for
it
but
snake
one
hand
closed
and
three
others
sprang
around
it
i
was
going
to
take
it
explained
geo
i
just
wanted
to
see
suddenly
the
door
of
the
forecastle
opened
and
the
tall
mate
was
silhouetted
against
the
brighter
light
behind
him
poet
he
called
she
wants
to
see
you
then
he
was
gone
geo
looked
at
the
other
two
shrugged
and
then
swung
off
the
berth
made
his
way
up
the
steps
and
into
the
hall
on
deck
it
was
completely
dark
as
he
walked
a
door
before
him
opened
and
a
blade
of
illumination
sliced
the
deck
he
jumped
come
in
summoned
the
priestess
of
argo
and
he
turned
into
a
windowless
cabin
and
stopped
one
step
beyond
the
threshold
the
walls
rippled
tapestries
lucent
green
scarlet
golden
braziers
perched
on
tapering
legged
tripods
beneath
plumes
of
pale
blue
smoke
that
lent
thin
incense
in
the
room
pierced
faintly
but
cleanly
into
his
nostrils
like
knives
light
lashed
the
polished
wooden
newels
of
a
great
bed
on
which
sat
swirls
of
silk
damasked
satin
brocade
a
huge
desk
cornered
with
wooden
eagles
was
spread
with
papers
meticulous
instruments
of
cartography
sextants
rules
compasses
and
great
shabby
books
were
piled
on
one
corner
above
from
the
beamed
ceiling
hung
by
thick
chains
swayed
a
branching
candelabra
of
oil
cups
some
in
the
hands
of
demons
the
mouths
of
monkeys
burning
in
the
bellies
of
nymphs
or
between
the
horns
of
satyrs
heads
red
clear
green
or
come
in
repeated
the
priestess
close
the
door
geo
obeyed
she
walked
behind
her
desk
sat
down
and
folded
her
hands
in
front
of
her
veiled
face
what
do
you
know
of
the
real
world
outside
leptar
that
there
is
much
water
some
land
and
mostly
ignorance
what
tales
have
you
heard
from
your
bear
friend
urson
he
is
a
traveled
man
and
should
know
some
of
what
there
is
of
the
earth
the
stories
of
sailors
said
geo
are
menageries
of
beasts
that
no
one
has
ever
seen
of
lands
for
which
no
maps
exist
and
of
peoples
whom
no
man
has
met
she
smiled
since
i
boarded
this
ship
i
have
heard
many
tales
from
sailors
and
i
have
learned
more
from
them
than
from
all
my
priests
you
on
the
docks
there
this
evening
have
been
the
only
man
to
give
me
another
scrap
of
the
puzzle
except
a
few
drunken
seamen
misremembering
old
fantasies
she
paused
what
do
you
know
of
the
jewels
you
saw
tonight
nothing
a
common
thief
hiding
on
the
docks
had
one
i
a
priestess
of
argo
possess
another
and
if
you
had
one
you
would
probably
exchange
it
for
a
kiss
with
some
tavern
maid
what
do
you
know
of
the
god
hama
i
know
of
no
such
god
you
she
said
who
can
spout
all
the
rituals
and
incantations
of
the
white
goddess
argo
you
do
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
dark
god
hama
what
do
you
know
of
the
island
of
aptor
nothing
this
boat
has
been
to
aptor
once
and
now
will
return
again
ask
your
ignorant
friend
the
bear
to
tell
you
tales
of
aptor
and
blind
wise
poet
you
will
laugh
and
probably
he
will
too
but
i
will
tell
you
his
tales
his
legends
and
his
fantasies
are
not
a
tithe
of
the
truth
not
a
tithe
perhaps
you
will
be
no
help
after
all
i
am
thinking
of
dismissing
you
but
geo
began
the
priestess
looked
up
having
been
about
to
begin
some
work
geo
regained
himself
what
can
you
tell
me
about
these
things
you
have
scattered
only
crumbs
i
have
extensive
knowledge
of
incantation
poetry
magic
and
i
know
these
concern
your
problem
give
me
what
information
you
have
and
i
will
be
able
to
render
mine
in
full
i
am
familiar
with
many
sailors
tales
true
none
of
aptor
or
hama
but
i
may
be
able
to
collate
fragments
i
have
learned
the
legends
and
jargon
of
thieves
through
a
broad
life
this
is
more
than
your
priests
have
i
wager
i
have
had
teachers
who
were
afraid
to
touch
books
i
have
opened
and
i
fear
no
secret
you
might
hold
no
you
are
not
afraid
admitted
the
priestess
you
are
honorable
and
foolish
and
a
poet
i
hope
the
first
and
last
will
wipe
out
the
middle
one
in
time
nevertheless
i
will
tell
you
some
she
stood
up
now
and
drew
out
a
map
here
is
leptar
she
pointed
to
one
island
then
her
finger
moved
over
water
to
another
this
is
aptor
now
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
any
ordinary
person
in
leptar
might
aptor
is
a
barbaric
land
uncivilized
yet
they
occasionally
show
some
insidious
organization
tell
me
what
legends
of
the
great
fire
have
you
heard
i
know
that
beasts
are
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
sea
and
destroyed
the
world
harbors
and
that
birds
spat
fire
from
the
sky
the
older
sailors
said
the
priestess
will
tell
you
that
these
were
beasts
and
birds
of
aptor
of
course
there
is
fifteen
hundred
years
of
retelling
and
distortion
in
a
tradition
never
written
down
and
perhaps
aptor
has
simply
become
a
synonym
for
everything
evil
but
these
stories
still
give
you
some
idea
chronicles
which
only
three
or
four
people
have
had
access
to
tell
me
that
once
five
hundred
years
ago
the
forces
of
aptor
actually
attempted
to
invade
leptar
the
references
to
it
are
vague
i
do
not
know
how
far
it
went
nor
how
successful
it
was
but
its
methods
were
insidious
and
very
unlike
any
invasion
you
may
have
read
of
in
history
so
unlike
that
records
of
it
were
destroyed
and
no
mention
of
it
is
made
in
the
histories
given
to
school
children
only
recently
have
i
had
a
chance
to
learn
how
strange
and
inhuman
they
were
and
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
forces
of
aptor
are
congealing
once
more
a
sluggish
but
huge
amoeba
of
horror
once
fully
awake
once
launched
it
will
be
irrevocable
tendrils
have
reached
into
us
for
the
past
few
years
probed
and
then
withdrawn
before
they
were
recognized
sometimes
they
dealt
catastrophic
blows
to
the
center
of
leptar
government
and
religion
all
this
has
been
assiduously
kept
from
the
people
i
have
been
sent
to
clear
perhaps
just
one
more
veil
from
our
ignorance
and
if
you
can
help
me
in
that
you
are
welcome
what
of
the
jewels
and
of
hama
inquired
geo
is
he
a
god
of
aptor
under
whom
these
forces
are
being
marshaled
and
are
these
jewels
sacred
to
him
in
some
way
both
are
true
and
both
are
not
true
enough
replied
the
priestess
and
one
more
thing
you
say
the
last
attempted
invasion
by
aptor
into
leptar
was
five
hundred
years
ago
it
was
five
hundred
years
ago
that
the
religion
of
argo
in
leptar
purged
all
her
rituals
and
instituted
new
ones
was
there
some
connection
between
the
invasion
and
the
purge
i
am
sure
of
it
declared
the
priestess
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
however
let
me
now
tell
you
the
story
of
the
jewels
the
one
i
wear
at
my
neck
was
captured
somehow
from
aptor
during
that
first
invasion
that
we
captured
it
may
well
be
the
reason
that
we
are
still
a
free
nation
today
since
then
it
has
been
guarded
carefully
in
the
temple
of
the
goddess
argo
its
secrets
well
protected
along
with
those
few
chronicles
which
mention
the
invasion
which
ended
incidentally
only
a
month
before
the
purges
then
about
a
year
ago
a
small
hoard
of
horror
reached
our
shore
from
aptor
i
can
not
describe
it
i
did
not
see
any
of
what
transpired
but
they
made
their
way
inland
and
managed
to
kidnap
argo
herself
you
mean
argo
incarnate
the
highest
priestess
yes
each
generation
as
you
know
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
past
generation
highest
priestess
is
chosen
as
the
living
incarnation
of
the
white
goddess
argo
she
is
reared
and
taught
by
the
wisest
priests
and
priestesses
her
youngest
daughter
when
she
dies
becomes
argo
at
any
rate
she
was
kidnaped
one
of
the
assailants
was
hacked
down
instantly
it
decayed
rotted
on
the
floor
of
the
convent
corridor
but
from
the
putrescent
mass
of
flesh
we
salvaged
a
second
jewel
from
aptor
and
before
it
died
it
was
heard
to
utter
the
lines
i
quoted
to
you
before
so
i
have
been
sent
then
to
find
what
i
can
of
the
enemy
and
to
rescue
or
to
find
the
fate
of
my
sister
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
said
geo
to
help
save
leptar
and
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
your
sister
priestess
more
than
my
sister
priestess
said
the
woman
softly
my
sister
in
blood
i
am
the
other
daughter
of
the
last
argo
that
is
why
this
task
fell
to
me
and
until
she
is
found
dead
or
returned
alive
here
she
rose
from
her
bench
i
am
the
white
goddess
argo
incarnate
geo
dropped
his
eyes
as
argo
lifted
her
veil
once
more
that
evening
she
held
forth
the
jewel
there
are
three
of
these
she
said
hama
sign
is
a
black
disk
with
three
white
eyes
each
eye
represents
a
jewel
with
the
first
invasion
they
probably
carried
all
three
jewels
for
they
are
the
center
of
their
power
without
them
they
would
have
been
turned
back
immediately
with
them
they
thought
themselves
invincible
but
we
captured
one
and
very
soon
unlocked
its
secrets
i
have
no
guards
with
me
with
this
jewel
i
need
none
i
am
as
safe
as
i
would
be
with
an
army
and
capable
of
nearly
as
much
destruction
when
they
came
to
kidnap
my
sister
a
year
ago
i
am
convinced
they
carried
both
of
their
remaining
jewels
thinking
that
we
had
either
lost
or
did
not
know
the
power
of
the
first
anyway
they
reasoned
they
had
two
to
our
one
but
now
we
have
two
and
they
are
left
with
only
one
through
some
complete
carelessness
your
little
thief
stole
one
from
me
as
i
was
about
to
board
when
we
first
departed
two
months
ago
today
he
probably
recognized
me
and
intended
to
exact
some
fee
for
its
return
but
now
he
will
be
put
to
a
true
thief
task
he
must
steal
for
me
the
third
and
final
jewel
from
hama
for
me
then
we
shall
have
aptor
and
be
rid
of
their
evil
and
where
is
this
third
jewel
asked
geo
perhaps
said
the
woman
perhaps
it
is
lodged
in
the
forehead
of
the
statue
of
the
dark
god
hama
that
sits
in
the
guarded
palace
somewhere
in
the
center
of
the
jungles
of
aptor
do
you
think
your
thief
will
find
himself
challenged
enough
i
think
so
answered
geo
somewhere
in
that
same
palace
is
my
sister
or
her
remains
you
are
to
find
them
and
if
she
is
alive
bring
her
back
with
you
and
what
of
the
jewels
asked
geo
when
will
you
show
us
their
power
so
that
we
may
use
them
to
penetrate
the
palace
of
hama
i
will
show
you
their
power
said
argo
smiling
with
one
hand
she
held
up
the
map
over
which
she
had
spoken
with
the
other
she
tapped
the
white
jewel
with
her
pale
fingernail
the
map
suddenly
blackened
at
one
edge
and
then
flared
argo
walked
to
a
brazier
and
deposited
the
flaming
paper
then
she
turned
again
to
geo
i
can
fog
the
brain
of
a
single
person
as
i
did
with
snake
or
i
can
bewilder
a
hundred
men
as
easily
as
i
can
fire
a
dried
worn
map
i
can
raze
a
city
with
those
to
help
smiled
geo
i
think
we
have
a
fair
chance
to
reach
this
hama
and
return
but
the
smile
with
which
she
answered
his
was
strange
and
then
suddenly
it
was
completely
gone
do
you
think
she
said
that
i
would
put
such
temptation
in
your
hands
you
might
be
captured
and
if
so
then
the
jewels
would
be
in
the
hands
of
aptor
once
more
but
with
them
we
would
be
so
powerful
they
have
been
captured
once
we
can
not
take
the
chance
that
they
be
captured
again
if
you
reach
the
palace
if
you
can
steal
the
third
jewel
if
my
sister
is
alive
and
if
you
can
rescue
her
then
she
will
know
how
to
employ
its
power
to
manipulate
your
escape
however
if
you
and
your
friends
do
not
accomplish
these
things
the
trip
will
be
useless
and
so
perhaps
death
would
be
better
than
a
return
to
watch
the
wrath
of
argo
in
her
dying
struggle
for
you
would
feel
it
more
horribly
than
even
the
most
malicious
torture
of
aptor
evil
geo
did
not
speak
why
do
you
look
so
strangely
asked
argo
you
have
your
poetry
your
spells
your
scholarship
do
you
believe
in
their
power
go
back
to
your
berth
and
send
the
thief
to
me
the
last
words
were
a
sharp
order
and
geo
turned
from
the
room
into
the
night
darkness
chapter
iii
geo
walked
down
into
the
forecastle
still
deserted
except
for
urson
and
snake
well
asked
urson
sitting
up
on
the
edge
of
his
berth
what
did
she
tell
you
why
are
you
asleep
geo
said
heavily
he
touched
snake
on
the
shoulder
she
wants
to
see
you
now
snake
stood
up
started
for
the
door
but
then
turned
around
what
is
it
geo
asked
snake
dug
into
his
clout
again
and
pulled
out
the
thong
with
the
jewel
he
walked
over
to
geo
hesitated
and
then
placed
the
thong
around
the
older
boy
neck
you
want
me
to
keep
it
for
you
geo
asked
but
snake
turned
around
and
was
gone
i
wonder
what
they
do
said
urson
or
did
you
find
out
come
on
geo
give
up
what
she
told
you
did
snake
say
anything
to
you
while
i
was
gone
not
a
peep
answered
urson
i
came
no
nearer
sleep
than
i
came
to
the
moon
now
come
on
what
this
about
geo
told
him
when
he
finished
urson
said
you
crazy
both
you
and
her
i
do
think
so
geo
said
he
concluded
his
story
by
recounting
argo
demonstration
of
the
jewel
power
urson
fingered
the
stone
on
geo
chest
all
that
in
this
little
thing
tell
me
do
you
think
you
can
figure
out
how
it
works
i
do
know
if
i
want
to
geo
said
it
does
sound
right
you
damn
straight
it
does
sound
right
urson
reiterated
the
point
of
sending
us
in
there
with
no
protection
to
do
something
that
would
be
crazy
with
a
whole
army
what
she
got
against
us
i
do
think
she
has
anything
against
us
geo
said
urson
what
stories
do
you
know
about
aptor
she
said
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
something
i
know
that
no
one
trades
with
it
everyone
curses
by
it
and
the
rest
is
a
lot
of
rubbish
not
worth
saying
what
rubbish
believe
me
it
just
bilge
water
insisted
urson
do
you
think
you
could
figure
out
that
little
stone
there
if
you
had
long
enough
i
mean
she
said
that
the
priests
five
hundred
years
ago
could
and
she
seems
to
think
you
as
smart
as
some
of
them
i
would
doubt
if
you
could
work
it
you
tell
me
some
stories
first
said
geo
oh
they
talk
about
cannibals
women
who
drink
blood
things
neither
man
nor
animal
and
cities
inhabited
only
by
death
sailors
avoid
it
save
to
curse
by
do
you
know
anything
more
than
that
there
nothing
more
to
know
shrugged
urson
she
said
the
stories
you
tell
would
not
be
one
tenth
of
the
truth
she
must
have
meant
that
there
was
even
a
tenth
part
of
the
truth
in
them
and
i
sure
she
right
you
just
misunderstood
no
i
heard
her
correctly
geo
assured
him
then
i
just
do
believe
it
there
are
half
a
dozen
things
that
match
up
in
all
this
first
how
that
little
fellow
happened
to
be
at
the
pier
after
two
months
just
when
she
was
coming
in
and
to
have
the
jewel
still
not
have
traded
it
or
sold
it
already
maybe
suggested
geo
he
read
her
mind
too
when
he
first
stole
it
the
same
way
he
read
ours
and
if
he
did
maybe
he
knows
how
to
work
the
things
i
say
let
find
out
when
he
comes
back
and
i
wonder
who
cut
his
tongue
out
strange
one
or
not
that
makes
me
sick
said
the
big
man
about
that
geo
started
do
you
remember
he
said
you
knew
the
man
it
was
i
know
many
men
said
urson
but
which
one
of
the
many
i
know
is
it
you
really
do
know
geo
asked
quietly
you
say
that
in
a
strange
way
urson
said
frowning
i
say
the
same
thing
he
said
went
on
geo
what
man
did
you
kill
urson
looked
at
his
hands
for
a
moment
stretched
the
fingers
turned
them
over
in
his
lap
like
meat
he
was
examining
then
without
looking
up
he
said
it
was
a
long
time
ago
friend
but
the
closeness
of
it
shivers
in
my
eyes
i
should
have
told
you
yes
but
it
comes
to
me
sometimes
not
like
a
memory
but
something
i
can
feel
as
hard
as
metal
taste
as
sharp
as
salt
and
the
wind
brings
back
my
voice
his
words
so
clearly
that
i
shake
like
a
mirror
where
the
figure
on
the
inside
pounds
his
fists
on
the
fists
of
the
man
outside
each
one
trying
to
break
free
we
were
reefing
sails
in
a
rain
when
it
began
his
name
was
cat
the
two
of
us
were
the
two
biggest
men
aboard
and
that
we
had
been
put
on
the
reefing
team
together
meant
that
this
was
an
important
job
and
one
to
be
done
well
and
right
water
washed
our
eyes
our
hands
slipped
on
wet
ropes
it
was
no
wonder
my
cloth
suddenly
flung
away
from
me
in
a
gust
billowing
down
in
the
rain
flapping
against
half
a
dozen
ropes
and
breaking
two
small
stays
clumsy
bawled
the
mate
from
the
deck
sort
of
sailor
are
you
and
through
the
rain
i
heard
cat
laugh
from
his
own
spar
the
way
luck
goes
he
cried
catching
at
his
own
cloth
that
threatened
to
pull
loose
i
pulled
mine
in
and
bound
her
tight
the
competition
that
goes
rightly
between
two
fine
sailors
drove
a
seed
of
fury
into
my
flesh
that
should
have
bloomed
as
a
curse
or
a
returned
jibe
but
the
rain
rained
too
hard
and
the
wind
was
too
strong
so
i
bound
my
sail
with
silence
i
was
last
down
of
course
and
with
only
a
few
lads
below
on
deck
when
i
saw
why
my
sail
had
come
loose
a
worn
mast
ring
had
broken
caused
a
main
rope
to
fly
and
my
canvas
to
come
tumbling
but
the
ring
also
had
held
the
nearly
broken
aft
mast
together
and
in
the
wind
a
split
twice
the
length
of
my
arm
pulled
open
and
snapped
to
again
and
again
like
a
child
noise
clapper
there
was
a
rope
near
and
inch
thick
line
coiled
on
a
spike
holding
myself
to
a
rat
line
by
not
much
more
than
my
toes
i
secured
the
rope
and
bound
the
base
of
the
broken
pole
each
time
it
snapped
to
i
looped
it
once
around
and
pulled
the
wet
line
tight
they
call
this
whipping
a
mast
and
i
whipped
it
till
the
collar
of
rope
was
three
feet
long
to
the
top
of
the
cleft
and
she
could
snap
any
more
then
i
hung
the
broken
ring
on
a
peg
near
by
so
i
could
point
it
out
to
the
ship
smith
and
get
him
to
replace
the
rope
with
a
metal
band
that
evening
at
mess
with
the
day
incidents
out
of
my
mind
and
hot
soup
in
my
mouth
i
was
laughing
over
some
sailor
tale
about
another
sailor
and
another
sailor
woman
when
the
mate
strode
into
the
hall
you
sea
scoundrels
he
bellowed
there
was
silence
of
you
bound
up
that
broken
mast
aft
i
was
about
to
call
out
it
was
me
when
another
man
beat
me
by
bawling
was
the
big
sailor
sir
that
was
a
name
both
cat
and
i
were
often
hailed
by
snarled
the
mate
captain
says
that
such
good
thinking
in
times
so
hard
as
these
should
be
rewarded
he
seen
the
job
and
approved
he
took
a
gold
coin
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
cat
you
go
big
sailor
but
i
think
it
as
much
as
any
man
should
do
and
then
he
turned
and
clomped
from
the
mess
hall
a
cheer
went
up
for
cat
as
he
pocketed
the
coin
i
could
see
his
face
the
anger
in
me
started
now
but
without
direction
should
it
go
to
the
sailor
who
called
out
the
name
of
the
hero
naw
for
he
had
been
down
on
deck
and
through
rain
and
darkness
probably
he
could
not
have
told
me
from
my
rival
anyway
at
that
distance
at
cat
but
he
was
already
getting
up
to
leave
the
table
and
the
first
mate
the
same
first
mate
of
this
ship
here
friend
that
we
on
now
he
was
out
stomping
somewhere
on
deck
perhaps
it
was
this
that
caused
my
anger
to
break
out
the
next
morning
when
we
were
in
calmer
weather
a
careless
salt
jarred
me
in
a
passage
way
and
suddenly
i
was
all
fists
and
fire
we
scuffled
we
banged
we
cursed
we
rolled
in
fact
we
rolled
right
under
the
feet
of
the
mate
who
was
coming
down
the
steps
at
the
time
he
sent
a
boot
into
us
and
eight
different
curses
and
when
he
recognized
me
he
sneered
the
clumsy
one
now
i
had
a
fiery
record
before
fights
on
ship
are
a
breach
few
captains
will
allow
this
was
my
third
and
one
too
many
and
the
mate
prompted
by
his
own
opinion
of
me
got
the
captain
to
order
me
flogged
so
like
a
carcass
to
be
sliced
and
bid
on
i
was
lead
out
before
the
assembled
sailors
at
the
next
sunrise
and
bound
to
the
main
mast
i
thought
my
wrath
went
all
toward
the
first
mate
now
but
black
turned
white
in
my
head
into
something
that
i
could
bite
into
when
he
flung
the
whip
to
cat
and
cried
big
sailor
you
done
your
ship
one
good
turn
now
rub
sleep
off
your
face
and
do
it
another
i
want
ten
stripes
on
that
one
back
deep
enough
to
count
easily
with
a
finger
dipped
in
salt
they
fell
and
i
did
breathe
the
whole
time
ten
lashes
is
a
whipping
a
man
can
recover
from
in
a
week
most
go
down
to
their
knees
with
the
first
one
if
their
rope
is
slack
enough
i
did
fall
until
they
finally
cut
the
ropes
from
my
wrists
nor
was
it
till
i
heard
a
second
gold
coin
rattle
down
on
the
deck
from
the
first
mate
hand
and
the
words
to
the
crew
how
a
good
sailor
gets
rich
that
i
made
a
sound
and
it
was
lost
in
the
cheer
which
sprung
from
the
other
men
cat
and
one
other
lugged
me
to
the
brig
as
i
fell
forward
hands
scudding
into
straw
i
heard
cat
voice
come
brother
the
way
the
luck
goes
then
the
pain
made
me
faint
a
day
later
when
i
could
pull
myself
up
to
the
window
and
look
out
on
the
back
of
the
ship
we
caught
the
worst
storm
i
ever
seen
and
the
slices
in
my
back
made
it
no
easier
on
me
pegs
threatened
to
pull
from
their
holes
boards
to
part
themselves
one
wave
washed
four
men
overboard
and
while
others
ran
to
save
them
another
came
and
swept
off
six
more
it
had
come
so
suddenly
that
not
a
sail
had
been
raised
and
now
the
remaining
men
were
swarming
to
the
ratlines
from
my
place
at
the
brig
window
i
saw
it
start
to
go
and
i
howled
like
an
animal
tried
to
pull
the
bars
away
but
legs
passed
my
window
running
and
none
stopped
i
screamed
at
them
and
i
screamed
again
the
ship
smith
had
not
yet
gotten
to
fix
my
makeshift
repair
on
the
aft
mast
with
another
metal
band
nor
with
my
anger
had
i
yet
even
pointed
it
out
to
him
as
i
had
intended
it
did
hold
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
it
gave
there
was
a
snap
like
thunder
under
the
tugging
of
half
furled
sails
ropes
popped
like
threads
men
were
whipped
off
like
drops
of
water
shaken
from
a
wet
hand
the
mast
raked
across
the
sky
above
me
like
a
claw
and
then
fell
against
the
high
mizzen
snapping
more
ropes
and
scraping
men
from
their
perches
as
you
scrape
ants
from
a
tree
the
crew
number
was
halved
and
when
somehow
we
crawled
from
under
the
sheets
of
rain
one
mast
fallen
and
one
more
ruined
the
broken
bodies
with
still
some
life
numbered
eleven
a
ship
infirmary
holds
ten
and
the
overflow
goes
to
the
brig
the
choice
of
who
became
my
mate
was
between
the
man
most
likely
to
live
figuring
that
he
could
take
the
harder
situation
more
easily
than
the
others
and
the
man
most
likely
to
die
figuring
that
it
would
probably
make
no
difference
to
some
one
that
far
gone
the
choice
was
made
the
latter
choice
and
the
next
morning
they
carried
cat
in
and
laid
him
beside
me
on
the
straw
while
i
slept
his
spine
had
been
crushed
at
the
pelvis
and
a
spar
had
pierced
his
side
with
a
hole
big
enough
to
put
your
hand
into
when
he
came
to
all
he
did
was
cry
not
with
the
agonized
howls
i
had
given
the
day
before
when
i
watched
the
mast
topple
but
with
a
little
sound
that
escaped
from
clenched
teeth
like
a
child
who
does
want
to
show
the
pain
it
did
stop
for
hours
and
such
a
soft
sound
it
burned
into
my
gut
and
my
tongue
deeper
than
any
animal
wailing
would
the
next
dawn
stretched
copper
foil
across
the
window
and
reddish
light
fell
on
the
straw
the
board
floor
and
the
filthy
crumpled
blanket
they
had
laid
him
in
the
crying
had
stopped
and
was
replaced
now
by
a
gasped
breath
sharp
every
few
seconds
irregular
loud
i
thought
he
must
be
unconscious
but
when
i
kneeled
to
look
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
stared
straight
into
my
face
he
said
to
me
with
the
next
gasp
hurts
you
still
i
said
be
still
the
next
word
i
thought
i
heard
was
water
but
there
was
any
in
the
cell
i
should
have
realized
that
the
ship
supplies
had
probably
gone
for
the
most
part
overboard
but
by
now
hungry
and
thirsty
myself
i
could
see
it
as
nothing
less
than
a
stupendous
joke
when
one
slice
of
bread
and
a
single
tin
cup
of
water
were
finally
brought
and
embarrassedly
and
silently
handed
in
to
us
about
seven
that
morning
nevertheless
i
opened
his
mouth
and
tried
to
pour
some
of
it
down
his
throat
they
say
a
man
mouth
and
tongue
turn
black
from
fever
and
thirst
after
a
while
it
not
true
the
color
is
the
deep
purple
of
rotten
shriveled
meat
and
every
taste
bud
on
the
dead
flesh
was
tipped
with
that
white
stuff
that
gets
in
your
mouth
when
your
bowels
are
upset
he
could
swallow
the
water
it
just
dribbled
over
the
side
of
his
mouth
that
was
scabbed
with
purple
crust
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
once
more
got
out
you
please
and
then
he
began
to
cry
again
is
it
i
asked
suddenly
he
began
to
struggle
and
got
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
torn
tunic
and
pulled
out
a
fist
he
held
it
out
toward
me
and
said
please
the
fingers
opened
and
i
saw
three
gold
coins
two
of
whose
histories
suddenly
leapt
into
my
mind
like
stories
of
living
men
i
moved
back
as
if
burned
then
i
leaned
forward
again
do
you
want
i
asked
he
said
moving
his
hand
toward
me
kill
and
then
he
was
crying
once
more
hurts
so
bad
i
got
up
i
walked
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
cell
i
came
back
then
i
broke
his
neck
with
my
knee
and
my
two
hands
i
took
my
pay
up
later
i
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
rest
of
the
water
then
i
went
to
sleep
they
took
him
away
without
question
and
two
days
later
when
the
next
food
came
i
realized
sort
of
absently
that
without
all
of
that
first
bread
and
water
i
would
have
starved
to
death
they
finally
let
me
out
because
they
needed
the
muscle
what
was
left
of
it
and
the
only
thing
i
sometimes
think
about
the
only
thing
i
let
myself
think
about
is
whether
or
not
i
earned
my
pay
i
guess
two
of
them
were
mine
anyway
but
sometimes
i
take
them
out
and
look
at
them
and
wonder
where
he
got
the
third
one
from
urson
put
his
hand
in
his
tunic
and
brought
out
three
gold
coins
never
been
able
to
spend
them
though
he
said
he
tossed
the
little
pile
into
the
air
and
then
whipped
them
back
into
his
fist
again
and
laughed
never
was
able
to
spend
them
on
anything
i
sorry
geo
said
after
a
moment
urson
looked
up
why
i
guess
these
are
my
jewels
huh
maybe
everyone
has
theirs
some
place
you
think
it
was
old
cat
maybe
sometimes
when
i
was
in
the
brig
perhaps
earning
that
third
coin
slicing
out
that
little
monster
tongue
somehow
i
doubt
it
look
i
said
i
was
sorry
urson
i
know
urson
said
i
know
i
guess
i
met
a
hell
full
of
people
in
my
short
wet
life
and
it
could
be
any
one
of
them
he
sighed
though
i
wish
i
knew
which
but
i
do
think
that
the
answer
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
mouth
now
and
gnawed
at
his
thumb
nail
i
hope
that
kid
does
get
as
nervous
as
i
do
he
laughed
he
have
such
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
nails
to
bite
then
their
skulls
nearly
split
apart
hey
said
geo
that
snake
and
he
in
trouble
too
said
urson
he
leaped
onto
the
floor
and
started
up
the
passageway
geo
came
after
him
let
me
go
first
geo
said
i
know
where
he
is
they
reached
the
deck
raced
along
the
side
of
the
cabins
until
they
reached
the
door
move
ordered
urson
then
he
rammed
against
the
door
and
it
flew
open
inside
behind
her
desk
argo
whirled
her
hand
on
her
jewel
what
is
the
but
the
moment
her
concentration
turned
snake
who
had
been
immobile
against
the
opposite
wall
suddenly
vaulted
across
the
table
toward
geo
geo
grabbed
the
boy
to
steady
him
and
immediately
one
of
snake
hands
was
at
geo
chest
where
the
jewel
hung
you
fools
hissed
argo
do
you
understand
he
a
spy
for
aptor
there
was
a
sudden
silence
then
argo
said
close
the
door
urson
closed
it
snake
still
held
geo
and
the
jewel
well
she
said
it
is
too
late
now
what
do
you
mean
asked
geo
that
had
you
not
come
blundering
in
one
more
of
aptor
spies
would
have
yielded
up
his
secrets
and
then
been
reduced
to
ashes
she
breathed
deeply
but
he
has
his
jewel
now
and
i
have
mine
well
little
thief
there
a
stalemate
the
forces
are
balanced
now
she
looked
at
geo
how
do
you
think
he
came
so
easily
by
the
jewel
how
do
you
think
he
knew
when
i
would
be
at
the
shore
oh
he
a
clever
one
with
all
the
intelligence
of
aptor
working
behind
him
he
probably
even
had
you
planted
without
your
knowing
it
to
interrupt
us
at
just
that
time
no
he
began
urson
we
were
walking
by
your
door
geo
interrupted
when
we
heard
a
noise
and
thought
there
might
be
trouble
your
concern
may
have
cost
us
all
our
lives
if
he
a
spy
i
gather
that
means
he
knows
how
this
thing
works
said
geo
let
urson
and
i
take
him
take
him
anywhere
you
wish
hissed
argo
get
out
just
then
the
door
opened
i
heard
a
sound
priestess
argo
and
i
thought
you
might
be
in
danger
it
was
the
first
mate
the
goddess
incarnate
breathed
deeply
i
am
in
no
danger
she
said
evenly
will
you
please
leave
me
alone
all
of
you
what
the
snake
doing
here
jordde
suddenly
asked
seeing
geo
still
holding
the
boy
i
said
leave
me
geo
turned
away
from
jordde
and
stepped
past
him
onto
the
deck
and
urson
followed
him
ten
steps
farther
on
he
glanced
back
and
seeing
that
jordde
had
emerged
from
the
cabin
and
was
walking
in
the
other
direction
he
set
snake
down
on
his
feet
all
right
little
one
march
in
the
passage
to
the
forecastle
urson
asked
hey
what
going
on
well
for
one
thing
our
little
friend
here
is
no
spy
said
geo
how
do
you
know
asked
urson
because
she
does
know
he
can
read
minds
how
do
you
mean
urson
asked
first
of
all
i
was
beginning
to
think
something
was
wrong
when
i
came
back
from
talking
to
the
priestess
you
were
too
and
it
lay
in
the
same
vein
you
were
talking
about
why
would
our
task
be
completely
useless
unless
we
accomplished
all
parts
of
her
mission
would
there
be
some
value
in
just
returning
her
sister
the
rightful
head
of
leptar
to
her
former
position
and
i
sure
her
sister
may
well
have
collected
some
useful
information
that
could
be
used
against
aptor
so
that
would
be
some
value
even
if
we
did
find
the
jewel
it
does
sound
too
sisterly
a
thing
to
me
to
forsake
the
young
priestess
if
there
is
no
jewel
in
it
for
her
and
her
tone
the
way
she
refers
to
the
jewel
as
there
an
old
saying
from
before
the
great
fire
even
power
corrupts
and
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely
and
i
think
she
has
not
a
little
of
the
desire
for
power
first
peace
afterwards
but
that
does
mean
this
one
is
an
aptor
spy
said
urson
wait
a
minute
i
getting
there
at
first
i
thought
he
was
too
the
idea
occurred
to
me
first
when
i
was
talking
to
the
priestess
and
she
first
mentioned
that
there
were
spies
from
aptor
the
coincidence
of
his
appearance
that
he
had
even
managed
to
steal
the
jewel
in
the
first
place
that
he
would
present
it
to
her
the
way
he
did
all
this
hinted
something
so
strange
that
spy
was
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
and
sure
it
was
the
first
thing
she
thought
as
well
and
she
especially
would
think
this
if
she
did
not
know
that
snake
could
read
minds
and
broadcast
mentally
because
ignorance
of
his
telepathy
removes
the
one
other
possible
explanation
of
the
coincidences
but
urson
why
did
he
leave
the
jewel
with
us
before
he
went
to
see
her
because
he
thought
she
was
going
to
try
and
take
it
away
from
him
exactly
when
she
told
me
to
send
him
up
to
her
i
was
fairly
sure
that
was
the
main
reason
she
wanted
him
but
if
he
was
a
spy
and
knew
how
to
work
the
jewel
then
why
not
take
it
with
him
present
himself
to
argo
with
the
jewel
showing
himself
as
an
equal
force
and
then
come
calmly
back
leaving
her
in
silence
and
us
still
on
his
side
especially
since
he
would
be
revealing
to
her
something
of
which
she
was
aware
of
already
and
would
watch
him
no
more
carefully
than
she
would
were
it
not
confirmed
all
right
said
urson
why
not
because
he
was
not
a
spy
and
did
know
how
to
work
the
jewel
yes
he
had
felt
its
power
once
perhaps
he
was
going
to
pretend
he
had
it
hidden
on
his
person
but
he
did
not
want
her
to
get
her
hands
on
it
for
reasons
that
were
strong
but
not
selfish
here
snake
said
geo
you
know
how
to
work
the
jewel
now
do
you
but
you
learned
from
argo
just
now
the
boy
nodded
here
then
why
do
you
take
it
geo
lifted
the
jewel
from
his
neck
and
held
it
out
to
him
snake
drew
back
and
shook
his
head
violently
urson
looked
puzzled
snake
has
seen
into
human
minds
urson
he
seen
things
directly
which
the
rest
of
us
only
learn
from
a
sort
of
second
hand
observation
he
knows
that
the
power
of
this
little
bead
is
more
dangerous
to
the
mind
of
the
person
who
wields
it
than
it
is
to
the
cities
it
may
destroy
well
said
urson
as
long
as
she
thinks
he
a
spy
at
least
have
one
of
them
little
beads
and
someone
who
knows
how
to
use
it
i
mean
if
we
have
to
i
do
think
she
thinks
he
a
spy
any
more
urson
huh
i
give
her
credit
for
being
able
to
reason
at
least
as
well
as
i
can
once
she
found
out
he
had
no
jewel
on
him
she
knew
that
he
was
as
innocent
as
you
and
i
are
but
her
only
thought
was
to
get
it
in
any
way
she
could
when
we
came
in
just
when
she
was
going
to
put
snake
under
the
jewel
control
guilt
made
her
leap
backwards
to
her
first
and
seemingly
logical
accusation
for
our
benefit
evil
likes
to
cloak
itself
as
good
they
stepped
down
into
the
forecastle
by
now
a
handful
of
sailors
had
come
into
the
room
mostly
drunk
and
snoring
on
berths
around
the
walls
one
had
wrapped
himself
completely
up
in
a
blanket
in
the
middle
berth
of
the
tier
that
urson
had
chosen
for
the
three
well
said
urson
to
snake
it
looks
like
you
have
to
move
snake
scrambled
to
the
top
bunk
now
look
that
one
was
mine
snake
motioned
him
up
huh
two
of
us
in
one
of
those
demanded
urson
look
if
you
want
someone
to
keep
warm
against
go
down
and
sleep
with
geo
there
more
room
and
you
wo
get
squashed
against
the
wall
i
a
thrasher
when
i
sleep
snake
did
move
maybe
you
better
do
what
he
says
geo
said
i
have
an
idea
that
you
got
another
idea
now
asked
urson
oh
damn
i
too
tired
to
argue
he
vaulted
up
to
the
top
bunk
now
move
over
and
be
very
small
he
stretched
out
and
snake
slight
body
was
completely
hidden
hey
get
your
elbows
out
of
there
geo
heard
urson
mutter
before
there
was
only
a
gentle
thundering
of
his
snore
mist
suffused
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
wet
lines
glowed
a
phosphorescent
silver
the
sky
was
pale
as
ice
pricks
of
stars
dotted
over
the
whole
bowl
the
sea
once
green
seemed
bleached
to
blowing
clouds
of
white
powder
the
door
of
a
cabin
opened
and
white
veils
flung
forward
from
the
form
of
argo
who
emerged
like
silver
from
the
door
the
whole
movement
of
the
scene
made
it
look
like
a
picture
imagination
fastens
in
the
slow
ripplings
of
gauze
under
breeze
one
dark
spot
was
at
her
throat
pulsing
darkly
like
a
heart
like
a
black
flame
she
walked
to
the
railing
peered
over
in
the
white
washing
a
skeletal
hand
appeared
it
raised
on
a
beckoning
arm
then
fell
forward
in
the
water
another
arm
raised
now
a
few
feet
away
beckoning
gesturing
then
three
at
once
then
two
voice
as
pale
as
the
vision
spoke
i
am
coming
we
sail
in
a
hour
the
mate
has
been
ordered
to
put
the
ship
out
before
dawn
you
must
tell
me
now
creatures
of
the
water
glowing
arms
raised
up
and
then
an
almost
featureless
face
chest
high
in
the
water
it
listed
backwards
and
sank
are
you
of
aptor
or
leptar
spoke
the
apparitional
figure
of
argo
again
in
the
thinned
voice
are
your
allegiances
to
argo
or
hama
i
have
followed
thus
far
you
must
tell
me
before
i
follow
farther
was
a
whirling
of
sound
which
seemed
to
be
the
wind
attempting
to
say
the
sea
the
sea
the
sea
argo
did
not
hear
for
she
turned
away
and
walked
from
the
rail
back
to
her
the
scene
moved
turned
toward
the
door
of
the
forecastle
it
opened
moved
through
the
hall
the
walls
more
like
polished
steel
than
weathered
wood
and
went
on
in
the
forecastle
the
yellow
oil
lamp
seemed
a
white
flaring
of
movement
stopped
in
front
of
a
tier
of
three
berths
on
the
bottom
one
lay
a
young
man
with
a
starved
pallid
face
his
mop
of
hair
was
bleached
white
on
his
chest
was
a
pulsing
darkness
a
black
flame
a
dark
heart
shimmering
with
the
indistinctness
of
absolute
shadow
on
the
top
bunk
a
great
form
like
a
bloated
corpse
lay
one
huge
arm
hung
over
the
bunk
flabbed
puffy
without
the
center
berth
was
an
anonymous
bundle
of
blankets
completely
covering
the
figure
inside
on
this
the
scene
fixed
drew
closer
and
the
paleness
suddenly
faded
before
darkness
into
shadow
into
geo
sat
up
and
knuckled
his
eyes
the
dark
forecastle
was
relieved
by
the
yellow
glow
of
the
lamp
the
gaunt
mate
stood
across
the
room
hey
you
he
was
saying
to
a
man
in
one
of
the
bunks
up
and
out
we
sailing
the
figure
roused
itself
from
the
tangle
of
bedding
the
mate
moved
to
another
up
you
dog
face
up
you
fish
fodder
sailing
turning
around
he
saw
geo
watching
him
and
what
wrong
with
you
he
demanded
we
sailing
did
you
hear
naw
you
go
back
to
sleep
your
turn
will
come
but
we
need
experienced
ones
now
he
grinned
briefly
and
then
went
on
to
one
more
eh
you
stink
like
an
old
wine
cask
raise
yourself
out
of
your
fumes
we
sailing
chapter
iv
that
dream
geo
said
to
urson
a
moment
after
the
mate
left
urson
looked
down
from
his
bunk
you
had
it
too
both
turned
to
snake
i
guess
that
was
your
doing
eh
urson
said
snake
scrambled
down
from
the
upper
bunk
did
you
go
wandering
around
the
deck
last
night
and
do
some
spying
geo
asked
by
now
most
of
the
other
sailors
had
risen
and
one
suddenly
stepped
between
urson
and
geo
me
mate
he
said
and
shook
the
figure
in
the
second
berth
hey
whitey
come
on
you
ca
be
that
soused
from
last
night
get
up
or
you
miss
mess
the
young
sailor
shook
the
figure
again
hey
whitey
the
figure
in
the
blankets
was
unresponsive
the
sailor
gave
him
one
more
good
shake
and
as
he
rolled
over
the
blanket
fell
away
from
the
blond
head
the
eyes
were
wide
and
dull
the
mouth
half
open
hey
whitey
the
black
sailor
said
again
and
then
he
stepped
back
slowly
mist
enveloped
the
ship
three
hours
out
from
port
urson
was
called
for
duty
right
after
breakfast
but
no
one
bothered
either
snake
or
geo
that
first
morning
snake
would
slip
off
somewhere
and
geo
would
be
left
to
wander
the
ship
alone
he
was
walking
beneath
the
dories
when
the
heavy
slap
of
bare
feet
on
the
wet
deck
materialized
in
urson
hey
greeted
his
friend
what
are
you
doing
under
here
nothing
much
geo
said
urson
was
carrying
a
coil
of
rope
about
his
shoulder
now
he
slung
it
down
into
his
hand
and
leaned
against
the
support
shaft
and
looked
out
toward
the
fog
it
a
bad
beginning
this
trip
has
had
he
said
what
few
sailors
i
talked
to
do
like
it
at
all
urson
said
geo
have
you
any
idea
what
actually
happened
this
morning
maybe
i
have
and
maybe
i
have
urson
said
what
ones
have
you
do
you
remember
the
dream
he
asked
urson
scrunched
his
shoulders
as
if
suddenly
cold
i
do
he
said
it
was
like
we
were
seeing
through
somebody
else
eyes
almost
our
little
friend
sees
things
in
a
strange
way
if
that
the
case
urson
that
was
snake
eyes
we
saw
through
i
asked
him
just
before
he
went
off
exploring
the
ship
it
was
somebody
else
all
he
did
was
get
the
pictures
and
relay
them
into
our
minds
and
what
was
the
last
thing
you
saw
as
a
matter
of
fact
urson
said
turning
i
think
he
was
looking
at
poor
whitey
bunk
and
who
was
supposed
to
be
sleeping
in
poor
whitey
bunk
snake
exactly
do
you
think
perhaps
white
was
killed
could
be
i
guess
but
how
and
why
and
who
somebody
who
wanted
snake
killed
maybe
the
same
person
who
cut
his
tongue
out
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
thought
we
decided
that
we
did
know
who
that
was
a
man
you
know
urson
geo
said
what
man
on
this
ship
have
you
sailed
with
before
do
you
think
i
been
looking
urson
asked
there
not
a
familiar
face
on
deck
other
than
maybe
one
i
seen
in
a
dockside
bar
but
never
one
whose
name
i
known
think
urson
who
on
this
ship
you
sailed
with
before
geo
asked
again
more
intently
suddenly
urson
turned
you
mean
the
mate
that
just
who
i
mean
said
geo
and
you
think
he
tried
to
kill
snake
why
did
snake
tell
us
because
he
thought
if
we
knew
we
get
in
trouble
with
it
and
he
may
be
right
how
come
asked
urson
look
we
know
something
is
fishy
about
argo
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
less
i
can
put
my
hands
on
it
but
if
something
is
fishy
about
the
mate
too
then
perhaps
he
in
cahoots
with
her
what
about
when
he
came
into
argo
cabin
last
night
when
we
were
there
maybe
he
was
just
doing
what
we
said
we
were
walking
by
when
he
heard
a
noise
if
it
was
his
eyes
we
were
seeing
through
then
he
sees
things
awfully
funny
then
maybe
he
a
strange
one
too
like
snake
who
things
funny
not
all
strangeness
shows
geo
reminded
him
you
could
be
right
said
urson
you
could
be
right
he
stood
up
from
where
he
had
leaned
against
a
lifeboat
support
well
you
think
some
more
friend
and
i
listen
i
see
you
later
he
hauled
up
his
rope
again
and
started
off
in
the
mist
geo
decided
to
search
for
snake
a
ladder
led
to
the
upper
deck
and
climbing
it
he
saw
across
the
deck
a
tall
figure
he
paused
and
then
started
forward
hello
he
said
the
captain
turned
from
the
railing
and
looked
at
him
good
morning
sir
geo
said
i
thought
you
might
be
the
mate
the
captain
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
said
good
morning
what
do
you
want
i
did
mean
to
disturb
you
if
you
were
no
disturbance
said
the
captain
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
get
to
aptor
another
three
weeks
shorter
if
this
wind
keeps
up
i
see
said
geo
have
you
any
idea
of
the
geography
of
aptor
the
mate
is
the
only
one
on
board
that
has
ever
set
foot
on
aptor
and
come
off
it
alive
except
priestess
argo
the
mate
sir
when
on
a
previous
voyage
he
was
wrecked
there
he
made
a
raft
and
drifted
into
the
open
sea
where
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
picked
up
by
a
ship
then
he
will
lead
whatever
party
goes
to
the
place
not
him
said
the
captain
he
sworn
never
to
set
foot
on
the
place
again
do
even
ask
him
to
talk
about
it
imagine
what
sort
of
a
place
it
must
be
if
probable
death
on
the
open
sea
is
better
than
struggling
on
its
land
no
he
pilot
us
through
the
bay
to
the
river
estuary
but
other
than
that
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
place
two
other
men
we
had
on
board
who
been
there
and
returned
they
went
with
the
priestess
argo
in
a
boat
of
thirteen
ten
were
dismembered
and
the
pieces
of
their
bodies
were
thrown
in
the
water
two
survived
to
row
the
priestess
back
to
the
boat
one
was
the
sailor
who
died
in
the
forecastle
this
morning
not
half
an
hour
ago
i
received
news
that
the
other
one
went
overboard
from
the
rigging
and
was
lost
in
the
sea
this
is
not
a
good
trip
men
are
not
to
be
lost
like
coins
in
a
game
life
is
too
valuable
i
see
said
geo
thank
you
for
your
information
and
time
sir
you
are
welcome
the
captain
said
then
he
turned
away
geo
descended
the
ladder
again
and
walked
slowly
forward
something
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
whirled
snake
god
damn
it
do
do
that
the
boy
looked
embarrassed
i
did
mean
to
yell
geo
said
putting
his
arm
around
the
shoulder
come
on
though
what
did
you
find
i
trade
you
what
i
know
for
what
you
do
came
from
snake
i
sorry
friend
laughed
geo
but
i
could
take
a
nap
now
if
you
paid
me
now
tell
me
whose
eyes
were
we
seeing
through
last
night
the
captain
snake
shook
his
head
the
mate
snake
nodded
i
thought
so
now
did
he
want
to
kill
wait
a
minute
said
geo
can
the
mate
read
minds
too
is
that
why
you
keeping
things
from
us
snake
shrugged
come
on
now
geo
said
do
a
little
yelling
and
explain
snake
thought
out
loud
see
what
he
sees
hear
what
he
hears
but
no
hear
thoughts
i
see
look
take
a
chance
that
he
ca
read
minds
and
tell
me
did
he
kill
the
man
in
the
bed
you
should
have
been
in
snake
paused
for
a
minute
then
nodded
do
you
think
he
was
trying
to
kill
you
snake
nodded
again
did
you
know
that
the
man
killed
this
morning
in
your
place
was
one
of
the
two
men
who
came
back
from
aptor
with
the
priestess
snake
looked
surprised
and
that
the
other
one
drowned
this
morning
fell
overboard
and
was
lost
snake
nearly
jumped
what
is
it
for
him
all
morning
he
not
dead
hear
thoughts
dim
who
not
dead
geo
asked
which
one
did
you
find
him
geo
asked
snake
said
alive
i
one
other
question
geo
raised
the
jewel
from
where
it
hung
against
his
chest
how
do
you
work
this
silly
thing
through
said
snake
geo
frowned
what
do
you
mean
can
you
tell
me
how
it
works
have
no
snake
said
electricity
diode
radio
electricity
diode
repeated
geo
the
sounds
coming
unfamiliarly
to
his
tongue
what
are
they
snake
shrugged
geo
got
a
chance
to
report
his
findings
to
urson
that
evening
and
the
big
man
was
puzzled
can
you
add
anything
geo
asked
all
i
had
a
chance
to
do
is
work
grumbled
urson
they
were
standing
by
the
edge
of
the
rail
beyond
which
the
mist
steeped
thickly
making
sky
and
water
indistinguishable
and
grave
hey
urson
suddenly
asked
what
are
you
looking
at
snake
stared
at
the
water
but
said
nothing
maybe
he
listening
to
something
suggested
geo
you
think
there
were
better
things
to
eavesdrop
on
than
fishes
said
urson
i
guess
argo
given
special
orders
that
you
two
get
no
work
some
people
let
go
eat
as
they
started
toward
the
convergence
of
sailors
at
the
entrance
of
the
mess
hall
urson
said
oh
guess
what
he
turned
to
geo
and
picked
up
the
jewel
from
the
boy
chest
all
you
people
are
going
around
with
such
finery
i
took
my
coins
to
the
smithy
and
had
him
put
chains
on
them
now
i
strut
with
the
best
of
you
he
laughed
and
then
went
through
the
narrow
way
crowding
with
the
other
sailors
into
the
wide
hall
for
two
weeks
nights
without
dreams
left
them
early
and
the
boat
rolled
from
beneath
the
fog
dawn
was
gray
but
clear
then
by
one
breakfast
time
the
ragged
slip
of
aptor
beach
hemmed
the
horizon
on
the
wheel
deck
the
sailors
clustered
to
the
rail
and
before
them
rocks
struck
like
broken
teeth
from
the
water
urson
in
his
new
triple
neckchain
joined
snake
and
geo
at
the
rail
whew
he
said
getting
through
them
is
going
to
be
fun
suddenly
heads
turned
behind
them
now
argo
dark
veils
bloated
with
the
breeze
filled
about
her
as
she
mounted
the
steps
to
the
wheel
deck
the
sailors
moved
away
from
her
then
one
hand
on
a
stay
rope
she
stared
across
the
gray
water
to
the
dark
tongue
of
land
from
the
wheel
the
captain
spoke
jordde
disperse
the
men
and
take
over
the
wheel
aye
sir
said
the
mate
you
you
and
you
to
the
tops
he
pointed
among
the
men
you
also
and
you
hey
did
you
hear
me
me
sir
geo
turned
around
yes
you
up
to
the
top
spar
there
you
ca
send
him
up
urson
called
out
he
never
been
topside
at
all
before
it
too
choppy
for
any
lad
first
time
up
he
does
even
know
and
who
asked
you
demanded
the
mate
nobody
asked
me
sir
said
urson
but
then
you
get
below
before
i
have
you
brigged
for
insubordination
and
fine
you
your
three
gold
baubles
do
you
think
i
recognize
dead
gold
now
look
here
urson
roared
geo
glanced
from
argo
to
the
captain
the
bewilderment
that
flooded
the
face
of
the
priestess
shocked
him
jordde
suddenly
seized
up
a
marlin
pin
raised
it
and
shouted
at
urson
get
down
below
before
i
break
your
skull
open
urson
fists
sprang
up
calmly
brother
bear
geo
began
in
a
bitch
ass
snarled
urson
and
swung
his
huge
arm
forward
something
leaped
on
jordde
from
behind
snake
the
marlin
pin
veered
inches
away
from
urson
shoulder
the
flung
fist
sunk
into
the
stomach
and
he
reeled
forward
passing
urson
with
snake
still
clawing
at
his
back
he
reached
the
rail
bent
double
over
it
and
snake
legs
flipped
up
when
jordde
rose
he
was
free
of
encumbrance
geo
rushed
to
the
edge
and
saw
snake
head
emerge
in
the
churning
water
behind
him
urson
yelled
look
out
jordde
marlin
made
an
inch
of
splinters
in
the
length
of
wood
against
which
he
had
been
leaning
not
him
cried
argo
no
no
not
him
but
jordde
had
seized
geo
shoulder
and
whirled
him
back
against
the
rail
geo
saw
urson
grab
a
loose
rope
behind
them
and
suddenly
swing
forward
intending
to
knock
jordde
away
with
his
feet
but
suddenly
argo
moved
in
the
way
of
his
flying
body
turned
saw
him
and
raised
her
hands
to
push
him
aside
so
that
he
swung
wide
of
them
and
landed
on
the
railing
a
yard
from
where
they
struggled
geo
feet
slipped
on
the
wet
boards
and
he
felt
his
body
suddenly
hurled
backwards
onto
the
air
then
his
back
slapped
water
as
he
broke
surface
urson
still
on
the
rail
called
to
him
hang
on
friend
geo
i
coming
urson
arms
swung
back
and
then
forward
as
he
dove
into
the
sea
now
geo
could
see
only
argo
and
jordde
at
the
rail
but
they
were
struggling
urson
and
snake
were
near
him
in
the
water
the
last
thing
he
saw
was
jordde
suddenly
wrest
something
from
argo
neck
and
then
fling
it
out
into
the
sea
the
priestess
hands
reached
for
the
flying
jewel
followed
its
arc
as
she
screamed
toward
the
water
then
hands
were
at
his
body
geo
turned
in
the
water
as
snake
disappeared
from
beside
him
and
urson
suddenly
cried
out
hands
were
pulling
him
down
roughness
of
sand
beneath
one
of
his
sides
and
the
flare
of
sun
on
the
other
his
eyes
were
hot
and
his
lids
were
orange
over
them
then
there
was
a
breeze
he
opened
his
eyes
and
shut
them
quick
because
of
the
light
then
he
turned
over
thought
about
pillows
and
stiff
new
sheets
reaching
out
he
grabbed
sand
he
opened
his
eyes
and
pushed
himself
up
from
the
beach
with
both
hands
spread
in
warm
soft
crumblings
over
there
were
rocks
and
thick
vegetation
behind
them
he
swayed
to
his
knees
the
sand
grating
under
his
kneecaps
he
looked
at
his
arm
in
the
sun
flecked
with
grains
then
he
touched
his
chest
his
hand
came
to
one
bead
moved
on
and
came
to
another
he
looked
down
both
the
chain
with
the
platinum
claw
and
the
thong
with
the
wire
cage
hung
around
his
neck
bewildered
he
heaved
to
his
feet
and
immediately
sat
down
again
as
the
beach
went
red
with
the
wash
of
blood
behind
his
eyeballs
he
got
up
again
slowly
carefully
geo
started
down
the
beach
looking
toward
the
land
when
he
turned
to
look
at
the
water
he
stopped
at
the
horizon
beyond
the
rocks
was
a
boat
with
lowered
sails
so
they
had
left
yet
he
swung
his
eyes
back
to
the
beach
fifty
feet
away
was
another
figure
lying
in
the
sun
he
ran
forward
now
the
sand
splashing
around
his
feet
sinking
under
his
toes
so
that
it
was
like
the
slow
motion
running
of
dreams
ten
feet
from
the
figure
he
stopped
it
was
a
young
black
very
dark
skin
the
color
of
richly
humused
soil
the
long
skull
was
shaved
like
geo
he
was
almost
naked
there
was
a
clot
of
seaweed
at
his
wrist
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
one
palm
were
grayish
and
shriveled
geo
frowned
and
stood
for
a
full
minute
he
looked
up
and
down
the
beach
once
more
there
was
no
one
else
just
then
the
man
arm
shifted
across
the
sand
immediately
geo
fell
to
his
knees
beside
the
figure
rolled
him
over
and
lifted
his
head
the
eyes
opened
squinted
in
the
light
and
the
man
said
who
are
you
my
name
is
geo
the
man
sat
up
and
caught
himself
from
falling
forward
by
jamming
his
hands
into
the
sand
he
shook
his
head
and
then
looked
up
at
geo
again
yes
he
said
i
remember
you
what
happened
did
we
founder
did
the
ship
go
down
remember
me
from
where
geo
asked
from
the
ship
you
were
on
the
ship
were
you
i
was
on
the
ship
geo
said
and
i
got
thrown
overboard
by
that
damned
first
mate
in
a
fight
but
nothing
happened
to
the
ship
still
out
there
you
can
see
it
suddenly
geo
stopped
then
he
said
you
the
guy
who
discovered
whitey
body
that
morning
that
right
he
shook
his
head
again
my
name
is
iimmi
now
he
looked
out
to
the
horizon
i
see
them
he
said
there
the
ship
but
where
are
we
on
the
beach
of
aptor
geo
told
him
iimmi
screwed
his
face
up
into
a
mask
of
dark
horror
no
he
said
softly
we
could
be
we
were
days
away
from
her
how
did
you
fall
in
it
was
blowing
up
a
little
iimmi
explained
i
was
in
the
rig
when
suddenly
something
struck
me
from
behind
and
i
went
toppling
in
all
the
mist
they
did
see
me
and
the
current
was
too
strong
for
me
and
he
looked
around
you
been
on
this
beach
once
before
have
you
geo
asked
once
said
iimmi
yes
once
do
you
realize
how
long
you
been
in
the
water
geo
asked
iimmi
looked
up
over
two
weeks
geo
said
come
on
see
if
you
can
walk
i
got
a
lot
of
things
to
explain
if
i
can
and
we
got
some
hunting
to
do
iimmi
steadied
himself
once
more
and
together
they
started
up
the
beach
what
are
you
looking
for
iimmi
asked
friends
geo
said
two
hundred
feet
up
the
rocks
and
torpid
vegetation
came
down
to
the
water
cutting
off
the
beach
scrambling
over
boulders
and
through
vines
they
emerged
on
a
rock
embankment
that
dropped
fifteen
feet
into
the
wide
estuary
of
a
ribbon
of
water
that
wound
back
into
the
jungle
twenty
feet
further
the
bank
dropped
to
the
river
surface
and
they
both
fell
flat
at
the
edge
of
a
wet
table
of
rock
and
sucked
in
cool
liquid
watching
blue
stones
and
the
white
and
red
pebbles
shivering
six
feet
below
clear
ripples
there
was
a
sound
both
sprang
back
from
the
water
turned
and
crouched
on
the
rock
hey
urson
said
through
leaves
i
was
wondering
when
i
find
you
light
through
branches
lay
on
the
gold
coins
hung
against
his
hairy
chest
have
you
seen
snake
i
was
hoping
he
was
with
you
said
geo
oh
urson
this
is
iimmi
the
other
sailor
who
died
two
weeks
ago
both
iimmi
and
urson
looked
puzzled
have
a
drink
of
water
geo
said
and
i
explain
as
best
i
can
do
mind
if
i
do
said
urson
while
the
bear
man
lay
down
to
drink
geo
began
the
story
of
aptor
and
leptar
for
iimmi
when
he
finished
iimmi
asked
you
mean
those
fish
things
in
the
water
carried
us
here
whose
side
are
they
on
apparently
argo
is
sure
either
geo
said
perhaps
neutral
and
the
mate
asked
iimmi
you
think
he
pushed
me
overboard
after
he
killed
whitey
i
thought
you
said
he
was
trying
to
kill
snake
said
urson
who
had
finished
drinking
he
was
explained
geo
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
all
three
probably
snake
first
and
then
whitey
and
iimmi
he
was
counting
on
our
fishy
friends
though
i
think
it
was
just
luck
that
it
was
whitey
he
got
rather
than
snake
if
he
ca
read
minds
which
i
pretty
sure
he
ca
he
probably
overheard
you
assigning
the
bunks
for
us
to
sleep
in
urson
when
he
found
out
he
had
killed
whitey
instead
it
just
urged
him
to
get
iimmi
out
of
the
way
more
quickly
i
could
easily
have
been
pushed
iimmi
agreed
but
i
still
do
see
why
if
there
is
a
spy
from
aptor
on
the
ship
then
jordde
is
it
said
geo
the
captain
told
me
he
had
been
to
aptor
once
before
it
must
have
been
then
that
he
was
enjoined
into
their
forces
iimmi
both
you
and
whitey
had
also
been
on
aptor
shore
if
only
for
a
few
hours
there
must
be
something
that
jordde
learned
from
the
island
that
he
was
afraid
you
might
learn
something
you
might
see
something
dangerous
dangerous
for
aptor
something
you
might
see
just
from
being
on
the
beach
probably
it
was
something
you
would
even
recognize
something
you
maybe
not
see
the
significance
of
until
much
later
but
probably
something
very
obvious
now
urson
spoke
what
did
happen
when
you
were
on
aptor
how
were
those
ten
men
killed
though
the
sun
was
warm
iimmi
shivered
he
waited
for
a
moment
and
then
he
began
we
took
a
skiff
out
from
the
ship
and
managed
to
get
through
the
rocks
somehow
it
was
evening
when
we
started
and
the
moon
i
remember
had
risen
just
above
the
horizon
though
the
sky
was
still
deep
blue
light
of
the
full
moon
is
propitious
to
the
white
goddess
argo
she
said
from
her
place
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
by
the
time
we
landed
the
sky
was
black
behind
her
and
the
beach
was
all
silvered
by
the
light
up
and
down
whitey
and
i
were
left
to
guard
the
skiff
at
the
water
edge
and
sitting
on
the
gunwales
shoulders
hunched
in
the
slight
chill
we
watched
the
others
go
up
the
beach
five
and
five
with
argo
behind
them
suddenly
there
was
a
scream
and
the
first
man
fell
they
came
from
the
air
like
vultures
the
moon
was
overhead
by
now
and
a
cloud
of
them
darkened
the
white
disk
with
their
wings
they
scurried
after
the
fleeing
men
over
the
sand
all
we
could
really
make
out
was
a
dark
battling
against
the
silver
there
were
swords
raised
in
the
white
light
screams
and
howls
that
nearly
sent
us
back
into
the
ocean
but
argo
and
a
handful
of
those
men
left
began
to
run
toward
the
boat
they
followed
them
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
loping
behind
them
half
flying
half
running
hacking
one
after
another
down
with
swords
i
saw
one
man
fall
forward
and
his
head
roll
from
his
body
while
blood
squirted
ten
feet
along
the
sand
crimson
under
the
moon
one
actually
caught
at
her
veils
but
she
screamed
and
slipped
from
it
into
the
water
now
and
climbed
back
into
the
boat
panting
you
would
think
a
woman
would
collapse
but
no
she
stood
in
the
bow
while
we
rowed
our
arms
off
they
would
not
come
over
the
water
apparently
and
somehow
we
managed
to
get
the
skiff
back
to
the
ship
without
foundering
against
the
rocks
our
aquatic
friends
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
that
said
geo
iimmi
you
say
her
veils
were
pulled
off
tell
me
do
you
remember
if
she
were
wearing
any
jewelry
or
not
she
certainly
was
iimmi
said
she
stood
there
in
only
her
dark
robe
her
throat
as
bare
as
ivory
she
was
going
to
bring
the
jewel
to
aptor
where
those
monsters
could
get
their
hands
on
it
again
said
urson
but
geo
if
jordde
the
spy
why
did
he
throw
the
jewel
in
the
sea
whatever
reason
he
had
said
geo
our
friends
have
given
it
to
me
now
you
said
argo
did
know
whose
side
these
sea
creatures
were
on
leptar
or
aptor
said
iimmi
but
perhaps
jordde
knows
and
why
he
threw
it
to
them
he
paused
for
a
moment
friend
i
think
you
have
made
an
error
you
tell
me
you
are
a
poet
and
it
is
a
error
the
hinge
in
your
argument
that
snake
is
no
spy
is
that
argo
must
have
dubious
motives
to
send
you
on
such
an
impossible
task
without
protection
saying
that
it
would
be
meaningful
only
if
all
its
goals
were
accomplished
you
reasoned
how
could
an
honest
woman
place
the
life
of
her
sister
below
the
value
of
a
jewel
not
just
her
sister
interrupted
geo
but
goddess
argo
incarnate
be
patient
said
iimmi
only
if
she
wished
to
make
permanent
her
temporary
condition
you
thought
could
she
set
such
an
impossible
task
there
may
be
some
truth
in
what
you
say
but
she
herself
would
not
bring
the
jewel
to
the
shores
of
aptor
though
it
was
for
her
own
protection
thanks
to
you
all
three
jewels
are
now
in
aptor
and
if
any
part
of
her
story
is
true
leptar
is
now
in
more
danger
than
it
has
been
in
five
hundred
years
you
have
the
jewels
two
of
them
and
you
can
not
use
them
where
is
your
friend
snake
who
can
both
snake
and
jordde
could
easily
be
spies
and
the
enmity
between
them
feigned
so
that
while
you
focused
on
one
you
could
be
misled
by
the
other
you
say
he
can
move
into
men
minds
perhaps
he
clouded
yours
they
sat
silent
for
the
lapsing
of
a
minute
argo
may
be
torn
by
many
things
continued
iimmi
but
you
in
watching
some
may
have
been
deluded
by
others
light
from
the
river
quivered
on
the
undersides
of
leaves
urson
spoke
now
i
think
his
story
is
better
than
yours
geo
then
what
shall
we
do
now
asked
geo
softly
do
what
the
goddess
requests
as
best
we
can
said
iimmi
find
the
temple
of
hama
secure
the
stone
rescue
the
young
goddess
and
die
before
we
let
the
jewels
fall
into
hands
of
aptor
from
the
way
you
describe
this
place
muttered
urson
that
may
not
be
far
off
still
mused
geo
there
are
things
that
do
mesh
like
why
were
you
saved
too
iimmi
why
were
we
brought
here
at
all
and
why
did
jordde
want
to
kill
you
and
the
other
sailor
perhaps
said
iimmi
the
god
hama
has
a
strange
sense
of
humor
and
we
shall
be
allowed
to
carry
the
jewels
up
to
the
temple
door
before
we
are
slaughtered
dropping
them
at
his
feet
he
smiled
then
again
perhaps
your
theory
is
the
correct
one
geo
and
i
am
the
spy
sent
to
sway
your
reason
urson
and
geo
glanced
at
each
other
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
theories
for
every
set
of
facts
said
the
negro
rule
number
one
assume
the
simplest
that
includes
all
the
known
conditions
to
be
true
until
more
conditions
arise
for
which
your
theory
no
longer
holds
rule
number
two
then
and
not
until
change
it
then
we
go
on
into
the
jungle
geo
said
i
guess
we
do
said
urson
since
we
got
this
job
we
got
to
trust
ourselves
and
do
it
right
let
see
if
we
can
put
one
more
of
those
things
around
your
neck
before
we
through
he
pointed
to
the
two
jewels
hanging
at
geo
chest
then
he
laughed
one
more
and
you
be
all
the
way
up
to
me
and
he
rattled
his
own
triple
necklace
chapter
v
light
lowered
in
the
sky
as
they
walked
beside
the
river
keeping
close
to
the
rocky
edge
and
brushing
away
vines
that
strung
into
the
water
from
hanging
limbs
urson
broke
down
a
branch
as
thick
as
his
wrist
and
as
tall
as
himself
and
smote
the
water
with
it
playfully
that
should
put
a
welt
on
anyone
head
who
wants
to
bother
us
he
raised
the
stick
from
the
water
and
drops
ran
along
the
bark
moving
sparks
at
the
ends
of
dark
lines
we
have
to
turn
into
the
woods
for
food
soon
said
iimmi
unless
we
wait
for
animals
who
come
down
to
drink
urson
tugged
at
another
branch
and
it
twisted
loose
from
fibrous
white
pulp
here
he
handed
it
to
iimmi
i
have
one
for
you
in
a
moment
geo
and
maybe
we
could
explore
a
little
before
it
gets
dark
geo
suggested
urson
handed
him
the
third
staff
there
not
much
here
i
want
to
see
he
muttered
well
we
ca
sleep
on
the
bank
we
got
to
find
a
place
hidden
in
the
trees
can
you
see
what
that
is
through
there
iimmi
asked
where
asked
geo
huh
through
the
thick
growth
was
a
rising
shadow
a
rock
or
a
cliff
he
suggested
maybe
mused
urson
but
it
awfully
regular
geo
started
off
into
the
underbrush
and
the
others
followed
their
goal
was
further
and
larger
than
it
had
looked
from
the
river
once
they
passed
across
a
section
of
ten
or
twelve
stones
rectangular
and
side
by
side
like
paving
small
trees
had
pushed
up
between
some
of
them
but
for
thirty
feet
before
the
edge
sank
beneath
the
soft
jungle
floor
it
was
easier
going
suddenly
the
growth
became
thin
again
and
they
were
at
the
edge
of
a
relatively
clear
area
before
them
loomed
the
ruins
of
a
great
building
six
girders
cleared
the
highest
wall
implying
an
original
height
of
eighteen
or
twenty
stories
one
wall
was
completely
sheared
away
and
fragments
of
it
chunked
the
ground
the
revealed
dark
caves
of
broken
rooms
and
cubicles
suggested
an
injured
granite
hive
they
approached
slowly
to
one
side
a
great
metal
cylinder
lay
askew
a
heap
of
rubbish
a
flat
blade
of
metal
transversed
it
one
side
twisting
into
the
ground
where
skeletal
girders
shown
beneath
ripped
plating
a
row
of
windows
like
dark
eyes
lined
the
body
and
a
door
gaped
in
an
idiotic
oval
halfway
along
its
length
fascinated
they
turned
toward
the
injured
wreck
as
they
neared
a
sound
came
from
inside
the
door
they
stopped
and
their
staves
leapt
a
protective
inch
from
the
ground
in
the
shadow
of
the
door
ten
feet
from
the
ground
another
shadow
moved
resolving
itself
into
an
animal
head
long
muzzled
gray
then
they
could
see
the
forelegs
it
looked
like
an
immense
dog
and
it
was
carrying
a
smaller
animal
obviously
dead
in
its
mouth
it
saw
them
watched
them
was
still
dinner
urson
said
softly
come
on
they
moved
forward
again
then
they
stopped
suddenly
the
beast
sprang
from
the
doorway
shadow
and
distance
had
made
them
completely
underestimate
its
size
along
the
sprung
arc
flowed
a
canine
body
nearly
five
feet
long
urson
struck
up
at
it
and
knocked
it
from
its
flight
with
his
stick
as
it
fell
iimmi
and
geo
were
upon
it
with
theirs
clubbing
its
chest
and
head
for
six
blows
it
staggered
and
could
not
gain
its
feet
then
as
it
threatened
to
heave
to
standing
urson
rushed
forward
and
brought
his
stave
straight
down
on
the
chest
bones
snapped
and
tore
through
the
brown
pelt
only
to
have
their
blue
sheen
covered
a
moment
later
by
a
well
of
blood
it
howled
kicked
its
hind
feet
at
the
stake
with
which
urson
held
it
to
the
ground
and
then
stretched
out
its
limbs
and
quivered
the
front
legs
stretched
and
stretched
while
the
torso
seemed
to
pull
in
on
itself
shrinking
in
the
death
agonies
the
long
mouth
which
had
dropped
its
prey
gaped
open
as
the
head
flopped
from
side
to
side
the
pink
tongue
lolling
shrinking
my
god
said
geo
the
sharp
muzzle
blunted
now
and
the
claws
in
the
padded
paw
stretched
opened
into
human
fingers
and
a
thumb
the
hairlessness
of
the
had
spread
to
the
entire
carcass
hind
legs
lengthened
joints
reversed
themselves
and
bare
knees
bent
as
human
feet
dragged
themselves
through
fragments
of
brown
leaves
over
the
ground
and
a
human
thigh
gave
a
final
contraction
stilled
and
then
one
leg
fell
out
straight
again
a
shaggy
man
lay
still
on
the
ground
his
chest
caved
and
bloody
in
one
last
throw
he
flung
his
hands
up
to
grasp
the
stake
and
pull
it
from
his
chest
but
too
weak
they
slipped
down
as
his
lips
curled
back
from
his
mouth
revealing
a
row
of
perfectly
white
blunt
teeth
urson
stepped
back
and
then
back
again
the
stave
fell
pulled
loose
with
a
sucking
explosion
from
the
ruined
mess
of
lung
the
bear
man
had
raised
his
hand
to
his
own
chest
and
seized
his
triple
gold
token
in
the
name
of
the
goddess
he
finally
said
iimmi
walked
forward
now
picked
up
the
carcass
of
the
smaller
animal
that
had
been
dropped
and
turned
away
well
he
said
i
guess
dinner
is
going
to
be
as
big
as
we
thought
i
guess
not
geo
said
they
walked
back
to
the
ruined
building
away
from
the
corpse
hey
urson
geo
said
at
last
to
the
big
man
who
was
still
holding
his
coins
snap
out
of
it
what
the
matter
the
only
man
i
ever
seen
whose
body
was
that
broken
in
that
way
he
said
slowly
was
one
whose
side
struck
into
by
a
ship
spar
they
decided
to
settle
that
evening
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
building
ruined
walls
they
produced
fire
with
a
rock
against
a
section
of
slightly
rusted
girder
and
after
much
sawing
on
a
jagged
metal
blade
protruding
from
a
pile
of
rubble
they
managed
to
quarter
the
animal
and
rip
most
of
the
pelt
from
its
red
body
with
thin
branches
to
hold
the
meat
they
did
a
passable
job
of
roasting
although
partially
burned
partially
raw
and
without
seasoning
they
ate
it
and
their
hunger
ceased
as
they
sat
huddled
by
the
wall
ripping
red
juicy
fibers
from
the
last
bones
with
their
teeth
night
swelled
through
the
jungle
imprisoning
them
in
the
shell
of
orange
flicking
from
their
fire
shall
we
leave
it
going
asked
urson
fire
keeps
animals
away
iimmi
said
on
leaves
piled
together
now
they
stretched
out
by
the
wall
of
the
broken
building
there
was
quiet
an
insect
hum
no
chitterings
except
for
the
comforting
rush
of
the
river
water
geo
was
first
to
awake
his
eyes
filled
with
silver
the
entire
clearing
had
been
flooded
by
white
light
from
the
huge
disk
of
the
moon
that
sat
on
the
rim
of
the
trees
iimmi
and
urson
beside
him
looked
uncomfortably
and
he
was
about
to
reach
over
and
touch
outstretched
arm
when
there
was
a
noise
behind
him
like
beaten
cloth
he
jerked
his
head
around
and
was
staring
at
the
gray
wall
by
which
they
had
camped
he
looked
up
at
the
spreading
plane
that
tore
off
raggedly
against
the
night
fatigue
had
washed
into
something
unpleasant
and
hard
in
his
belly
that
had
little
to
do
with
tiredness
he
stretched
his
arm
in
the
leaves
once
more
and
put
his
cheek
down
on
the
cool
flesh
of
his
shoulder
the
beating
sound
came
again
and
continued
for
a
few
seconds
he
rolled
his
face
up
and
stared
at
the
sky
something
crossed
on
the
moon
it
seemed
to
expand
a
moment
spread
its
wings
and
draw
them
in
again
he
reached
out
his
arm
over
the
leaves
like
thunder
and
grabbed
iimmi
black
shoulder
iimmi
grunted
started
then
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
opened
his
eyes
geo
saw
the
black
chest
drop
with
expelled
breath
the
only
recognition
given
a
few
seconds
later
the
chest
rose
again
iimmi
turned
his
face
to
geo
and
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
then
he
turned
his
face
back
up
to
the
night
three
more
times
the
flapping
sounded
behind
them
behind
the
wall
geo
realized
once
he
glanced
down
again
and
saw
that
iimmi
had
raised
his
arm
and
put
it
over
his
eyes
they
passed
years
that
way
then
a
flock
suddenly
leapt
from
the
wall
some
of
them
fell
twenty
feet
before
their
wings
filled
with
air
and
they
rose
again
they
circled
wider
and
before
they
returned
another
flock
dropped
off
into
the
night
as
they
fell
this
time
geo
suddenly
grabbed
iimmi
arm
and
pulled
it
down
from
his
eyes
the
figures
dropped
through
the
dark
like
kites
sixty
feet
above
them
forty
feet
thirty
then
there
was
a
thin
piercing
shriek
iimmi
was
up
on
his
feet
in
a
second
and
geo
beside
him
their
staffs
in
hand
here
it
comes
breathed
iimmi
he
kicked
at
urson
but
the
big
man
was
already
on
his
knees
and
then
feet
the
wings
beat
insistently
and
darkly
before
them
as
they
stood
against
the
wall
the
figures
flew
toward
them
and
at
the
terrifying
distance
of
five
feet
reversed
i
do
think
they
can
get
in
at
the
wall
said
iimmi
i
hope
the
hell
they
ca
urson
said
the
figures
dropped
to
the
ground
black
wings
crumpling
to
their
bodies
in
the
moonlight
in
the
growing
hoard
of
shadow
in
front
of
them
light
snagged
on
a
metal
blade
then
two
of
the
creatures
detached
from
the
others
and
hurled
themselves
forward
swords
arcing
suddenly
above
their
heads
they
swung
their
staffs
as
hard
as
they
could
catching
both
beasts
on
the
chest
they
fell
backwards
in
a
sudden
expansion
of
rubbery
wings
as
though
they
had
stumbled
into
billowing
dark
canvas
three
more
now
leapt
over
the
fallen
ones
shrieking
as
they
came
urson
looked
up
and
jammed
his
staff
into
the
belly
of
a
fourth
monster
who
was
about
to
fall
on
them
from
above
one
got
past
iimmi
whistling
staff
and
geo
had
to
stop
swinging
and
grab
a
furry
arm
he
pulled
it
to
the
side
overbalancing
the
huge
sailed
creature
it
dropped
its
sword
as
it
lay
for
a
moment
struggling
on
its
back
geo
grabbed
the
blade
and
brought
it
straight
from
the
ground
up
into
the
gut
of
another
of
the
creatures
who
spread
open
its
wings
and
staggered
back
he
wrested
the
blade
free
and
then
turned
it
down
into
the
body
of
the
fallen
one
it
made
a
thick
sound
like
a
crushed
sponge
as
the
blade
came
out
again
and
he
hacked
into
a
shadow
on
his
left
a
voice
suddenly
sounded
but
inside
his
head
jewels
snake
bawled
geo
where
the
hell
are
you
he
was
still
holding
his
staff
and
now
he
flung
it
forward
into
the
face
of
an
advancing
beast
struck
it
opened
up
like
a
black
parachute
knocking
away
three
of
its
companions
before
it
fell
in
the
view
cleared
for
an
instant
geo
saw
a
slight
spidery
form
dart
from
the
jungle
edge
into
the
clearing
with
his
free
hand
geo
ripped
the
jewels
from
his
neck
and
flung
the
confused
handful
of
thong
and
chain
over
the
heads
of
the
shrieking
beasts
the
beads
made
a
double
eye
in
the
light
at
the
top
of
their
arc
before
they
fell
on
the
leaves
beyond
snake
picked
them
up
and
held
them
above
his
head
fire
leapt
from
the
boy
hands
in
a
double
bolt
that
converged
in
the
center
of
the
dark
bodies
a
red
flair
silhouetted
the
jagged
edge
of
a
wing
a
wing
flamed
waved
flame
and
the
burning
beast
tried
to
take
air
before
it
fell
splashing
fire
about
it
orange
light
caught
sharp
on
brown
faces
chiseled
with
shadow
caught
in
the
terrified
red
bead
of
an
eye
or
along
double
fangs
behind
dark
lips
burning
wings
withered
on
the
ground
dead
leaves
had
sparked
now
and
whips
of
light
ran
on
the
clearing
floor
the
beasts
retreated
and
the
three
men
stood
against
the
wall
panting
watch
out
iimmi
suddenly
called
snake
looked
up
as
the
great
wings
tented
over
him
hiding
him
momentarily
red
flared
beneath
them
and
suddenly
the
beasts
fell
away
their
sails
sweeping
over
the
dead
leaves
moved
by
wind
or
life
geo
could
tell
dark
flappings
rose
on
the
moon
grew
further
away
and
were
gone
away
from
the
wall
they
saw
the
fire
had
blown
up
against
the
wall
and
was
dying
they
ran
quickly
toward
the
edge
of
the
forest
snake
said
geo
when
they
stopped
this
is
iimmi
this
is
snake
we
told
you
about
him
iimmi
extended
his
hand
glad
to
meet
you
look
said
geo
he
can
read
your
mind
so
if
you
still
think
he
a
spy
iimmi
grinned
remember
the
general
rule
if
he
is
a
spy
it
going
to
get
much
too
complicated
trying
to
figure
why
he
saved
us
like
that
urson
scratched
his
head
if
it
a
choice
between
snake
and
nothing
we
better
take
snake
hey
four
arms
i
owe
you
a
thrashing
he
paused
then
laughed
i
hope
some
day
i
get
a
chance
to
give
it
to
you
where
have
you
been
anyway
geo
asked
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
you
wet
our
water
friends
again
suggested
urson
probably
said
geo
snake
now
held
one
hand
toward
geo
what
that
oh
you
do
want
to
keep
them
snake
shook
his
head
all
right
said
geo
he
took
one
jewel
and
put
it
around
his
neck
geo
took
the
wrought
chain
with
the
platinum
claw
from
his
neck
and
hung
it
around
iimmi
the
white
eye
shown
on
his
dark
chest
in
the
moonlight
now
snake
beckoned
them
to
follow
him
back
across
the
clearing
they
came
stopping
to
pick
up
swords
from
the
shriveled
darknesses
on
the
ground
about
the
clearing
as
they
passed
around
the
edge
of
the
broken
building
geo
looked
for
the
corpse
they
had
left
there
but
it
was
gone
where
are
we
going
asked
urson
snake
only
motioned
them
onward
they
neared
the
broken
cylinder
and
snake
scrambled
up
the
rubble
under
the
dark
hole
through
which
the
had
leaped
earlier
that
evening
at
the
door
snake
turned
and
lifted
the
jewel
from
geo
neck
and
held
it
aloft
the
jewel
glowed
now
with
a
light
that
seeped
into
the
corners
and
crevices
of
the
ruined
entrance
shreds
of
cloth
hung
at
the
windows
most
of
which
were
broken
twigs
and
rubbish
littered
the
metal
floor
they
walked
between
double
seats
toward
a
door
at
the
far
end
effaced
signs
still
hung
on
the
walls
n
sm
k
g
the
door
at
the
end
was
ajar
and
snake
opened
it
all
the
way
something
scuttered
through
a
cracked
window
the
jewel
light
showed
two
seats
broken
from
their
fixtures
vines
covered
the
front
window
in
which
only
a
few
splinters
of
glass
hung
on
the
rim
draped
in
rotten
fabric
a
few
metal
rings
about
wrists
and
ankles
two
skeletons
with
silver
helmets
had
fallen
from
the
seats
snake
pointed
to
a
row
of
smashed
glass
disks
in
front
of
the
broken
seats
they
heard
in
their
minds
now
he
reached
down
into
the
mess
on
the
floor
and
dislodged
a
chunk
of
rusted
metal
he
said
showing
it
to
geo
the
three
men
examined
it
what
it
good
for
asked
urson
snake
shrugged
are
there
any
electricities
or
diodes
around
asked
geo
remembering
the
words
from
before
snake
shrugged
again
why
did
you
want
to
show
us
all
this
geo
asked
the
boy
only
turned
and
started
back
toward
the
door
when
they
were
standing
in
the
oval
entrance
about
to
climb
down
iimmi
pointed
to
the
ruins
of
the
building
ahead
of
them
do
you
know
what
that
building
was
called
snake
said
i
know
that
word
said
geo
so
do
i
said
iimmi
it
means
a
place
where
they
used
to
keep
soldiers
all
together
it
from
one
of
the
old
languages
where
to
now
urson
asked
snake
the
boy
climbed
back
down
into
the
clearing
and
they
followed
him
into
the
denser
wood
where
only
pearls
of
light
scattered
through
the
trees
they
emerged
at
a
broad
ribbon
of
silver
the
river
broken
by
rocks
we
were
right
the
first
time
geo
said
we
should
have
stayed
here
the
sound
of
rippling
sloshing
the
full
whisper
of
leaves
and
foliage
along
the
edges
of
the
forest
these
accompanied
them
as
they
lay
down
on
the
dried
moss
behind
the
larger
rocks
and
with
the
heaviness
of
release
on
them
they
dropped
like
stones
down
a
well
the
bright
pool
of
sleep
bright
pool
of
silver
grew
and
spread
and
wrinkled
into
the
familiar
shapes
of
mast
the
rail
of
the
deck
and
the
whiteness
of
the
sea
beyond
the
ship
the
scene
moved
down
the
deck
until
another
gaunt
figure
approached
from
the
other
direction
the
features
though
strangely
distorted
by
whiteness
and
pulled
to
grotesquerie
were
recognizable
as
those
of
the
captain
as
he
drew
oh
mate
said
the
while
the
mate
gave
an
answer
they
could
yes
answered
the
captain
i
wonder
what
she
wants
too
his
voice
was
hollow
etiolated
like
a
flower
grown
in
darkness
the
captain
turned
and
knocked
on
argo
cabin
door
it
opened
and
they
stepped
hand
that
opened
the
door
for
them
was
thin
as
winter
twigs
the
walls
of
the
room
seemed
draped
in
spider
webs
and
hangings
insubstantial
as
layered
dust
the
great
desk
seemed
spindly
grotesque
and
the
papers
on
top
of
it
were
tissue
thin
threatening
to
scutter
and
crumble
with
a
breath
the
chandelier
above
gave
more
languishing
white
smoke
than
light
and
the
arms
branches
and
complexed
array
of
oil
cups
looked
like
a
convocation
of
spoke
in
a
pale
white
voice
that
sounded
like
the
whisper
of
thin
fingers
tearing
so
she
said
we
will
stay
at
least
another
seven
days
but
why
asked
the
i
have
received
a
sign
from
the
sea
i
do
not
wish
to
question
your
authority
priestess
began
the
then
do
not
interrupted
my
mate
has
raised
the
objection
that
your
mate
has
raised
his
hand
to
me
once
stated
the
priestess
it
is
only
in
my
benevolence
here
she
paused
and
her
voice
became
more
unsure
that
i
do
not
destroy
him
where
he
stands
beneath
her
veil
a
face
could
be
made
out
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
dried
but
began
the
we
wait
here
by
the
island
of
aptor
another
seven
days
commanded
argo
she
looked
away
from
the
captain
now
in
a
direction
that
must
have
been
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
mate
from
behind
the
veil
hate
welled
like
living
liquid
from
the
seemingly
empty
sockets
they
turned
to
go
and
once
more
on
deck
they
stopped
to
watch
the
sea
near
the
indistinct
horizon
a
sharp
tongue
of
land
outlined
itself
with
mountains
the
cliffs
were
chalky
on
one
side
then
streaked
with
red
and
blue
clays
on
the
other
there
was
a
reddish
glow
beyond
one
mountain
like
the
shimmering
of
a
volcano
and
dark
as
most
of
it
was
it
was
a
distinct
darkness
backed
with
purple
or
broken
by
the
warm
differing
grays
of
individual
rocks
even
through
the
night
at
this
distance
beyond
the
silver
crescent
of
the
beach
the
jungle
looked
rich
green
even
in
the
darkness
redolently
full
and
quiveringly
heavy
with
and
then
the
thin
screams
chapter
vi
geo
rolled
over
and
out
of
sleep
stones
and
moss
beneath
his
shoulder
he
grabbed
his
sword
and
was
on
his
feet
instantly
iimmi
was
also
standing
with
raised
blade
the
river
sloshed
coldly
behind
them
the
thin
screaming
came
again
like
a
hot
wire
drawn
down
the
gelid
morning
snake
and
urson
were
also
up
now
the
sounds
came
from
the
direction
of
the
ruined
barracks
geo
started
forward
cautiously
curiosity
drawing
him
toward
the
sound
fear
sending
him
from
the
relatively
unprotected
bank
and
into
the
woods
the
others
followed
him
abruptly
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
forest
wall
beyond
which
was
the
clear
space
before
the
broken
building
they
crouched
now
behind
the
trees
watching
fascinated
between
ape
and
man
it
hovered
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
in
the
shadow
it
was
snake
height
but
more
of
urson
build
an
animal
pelt
wrapped
its
middle
and
went
over
its
shoulder
clothing
it
more
fully
than
either
of
the
four
humans
were
clothed
it
loped
four
steps
into
the
clearing
uttered
its
piercing
shriek
and
fell
on
a
hunk
of
flesh
that
last
night
beasts
had
dropped
from
the
sky
its
head
rocked
back
and
forth
as
it
tore
at
its
food
once
it
raised
its
head
and
a
sliver
of
flesh
shook
from
its
teeth
before
the
face
dropped
again
to
devour
they
watched
the
huge
fingers
upon
broad
flat
palms
tipped
with
claws
convulse
again
and
again
reflexively
into
the
gray
fibrous
meat
while
the
fanged
mouth
ripped
whether
it
was
a
shift
of
breeze
or
a
final
reflex
geo
could
tell
but
one
of
the
membranous
sails
raised
darkly
and
beat
about
the
oblivious
animal
that
fed
on
its
corpse
come
on
urson
said
let
go
a
thin
scream
sounded
behind
them
and
they
whirled
it
crouched
apishly
the
fingers
opened
and
closed
like
breathing
and
the
shaggy
head
was
knotted
with
dirt
and
twigs
the
breath
hissed
from
the
faintly
moving
full
lips
urson
reached
for
his
sword
but
iimmi
saw
him
and
whispered
no
do
the
negro
extended
his
hand
and
moved
slowly
forward
the
hulking
form
took
a
step
back
and
mewed
geo
suddenly
caught
the
idea
coming
up
beside
iimmi
he
made
a
quick
series
of
snaps
with
his
fingers
and
said
in
a
coaxing
baby
voice
come
come
come
he
laughed
softly
to
urson
back
over
his
shoulder
it
wo
hurt
us
he
said
if
we
do
hurt
it
added
iimmi
it
some
sort
of
necrophage
a
what
asked
urson
it
only
eats
dead
things
geo
explained
they
mentioned
in
some
of
the
old
legends
apparently
after
the
great
fire
so
the
story
goes
there
were
more
of
these
things
around
than
anything
else
in
leptar
though
they
became
extinct
come
here
cutie
said
iimmi
nice
little
sweet
little
pretty
little
thing
it
mewed
again
bowed
its
head
came
over
and
rubbed
against
hip
smells
like
hell
the
negro
observed
scratching
behind
its
ear
watch
out
there
big
boy
the
beast
gave
a
particularly
affectionate
rub
that
almost
upset
iimmi
balance
leave
your
pet
alone
said
urson
and
let
get
going
geo
patted
the
skull
so
long
beautiful
he
said
they
turned
toward
the
river
again
as
they
emerged
on
the
rocky
bank
geo
said
well
at
least
we
know
we
have
seven
days
to
get
to
the
temple
of
hama
and
out
again
what
do
you
mean
asked
iimmi
do
you
remember
the
dream
back
on
the
ship
who
was
thinking
that
asked
iimmi
jordde
the
first
mate
he
makes
everybody
look
dead
i
thought
i
was
having
a
nightmare
i
could
hardly
recognize
the
captain
you
see
one
reason
for
believing
he
a
spy
because
of
the
way
he
sees
things
again
he
smiled
a
poet
reason
i
afraid
but
i
see
the
thin
shriek
sounded
behind
them
and
they
turned
to
see
the
hulking
form
crouched
on
the
rocks
above
them
said
urson
there
your
cute
friend
i
hope
we
have
picked
up
a
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
said
geo
it
loped
down
over
the
rocks
and
stopped
just
before
them
what
it
got
iimmi
asked
i
ca
tell
said
geo
reaching
into
the
bib
of
its
animal
skin
it
brought
out
a
gray
hunk
of
meat
and
held
it
toward
them
iimmi
laughed
breakfast
he
said
that
demanded
urson
can
you
suggest
anything
better
geo
asked
he
took
the
meat
from
the
beast
claws
thanks
gorgeous
it
turned
looked
back
and
bounded
up
the
bank
and
into
the
forest
again
with
fire
from
the
jewels
and
wooden
spits
from
the
woods
they
soon
had
the
meat
crackling
and
brown
and
the
grease
bubbling
down
its
sides
and
hissing
onto
the
hot
stones
they
had
used
to
rim
the
flame
urson
sat
apart
sniffed
and
then
moved
closer
and
finally
scratched
his
big
fingers
through
his
hairy
stomach
and
said
damn
it
i
hungry
they
made
room
for
him
at
the
fire
without
comment
sun
struck
the
tops
of
the
trees
for
the
first
time
that
morning
and
a
moment
later
splashed
copper
in
concentric
curves
on
the
water
by
the
rock
edge
staining
it
further
with
dull
gold
you
seem
to
know
your
way
around
awfully
well
have
you
ever
been
on
aptor
before
iimmi
asked
snake
suddenly
snake
paused
for
a
moment
then
he
nodded
slowly
they
were
all
silent
now
finally
geo
asked
what
made
you
ask
that
something
in
your
first
theory
iimmi
said
i
been
thinking
it
for
some
time
and
i
guess
you
knew
i
was
thinking
it
too
four
arms
you
thought
jordde
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
whitey
and
snake
and
that
it
was
just
an
accident
that
he
caught
whitey
first
instead
of
snake
you
thought
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
whitey
and
me
because
of
something
seen
or
might
have
seen
when
we
were
on
aptor
with
argo
i
just
thought
perhaps
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
snake
for
the
same
reason
which
meant
he
might
have
been
on
aptor
before
too
jordde
was
on
aptor
before
said
urson
you
said
that
when
he
became
a
spy
for
them
they
all
turned
to
snake
who
stood
quietly
i
do
think
we
ought
to
ask
him
any
more
questions
said
iimmi
the
answers
are
going
to
do
us
any
good
and
no
matter
what
we
find
out
we
got
a
job
to
do
and
seven
no
six
and
a
half
days
to
do
it
in
snake
quietly
handed
the
metal
chain
with
the
pendant
jewel
back
to
iimmi
the
dark
man
put
it
around
his
neck
once
more
and
they
turned
up
the
river
by
twelve
the
sun
had
parched
the
sky
once
they
stopped
to
swim
and
cool
themselves
chill
water
gave
before
reaching
arms
and
lowered
faces
they
even
dove
in
search
of
their
aquatic
helpers
but
grubbed
the
pebbly
bottom
of
the
river
with
blind
fingers
instead
coming
up
with
dripping
twigs
and
smooth
wet
stones
soon
they
were
in
a
splashing
match
of
which
it
is
fair
to
say
snake
won
hands
down
hunger
thrust
its
sharp
finger
into
their
abdomens
once
more
only
a
mile
on
maybe
we
should
have
saved
some
of
that
stuff
from
breakfast
muttered
urson
iimmi
suddenly
broke
away
from
the
bank
toward
the
forest
come
on
he
said
let
get
some
food
the
building
they
suddenly
came
upon
had
tongues
of
moss
licking
twenty
to
fifty
feet
up
the
loosely
mortared
stones
a
hundred
yards
from
the
water
the
jungle
came
right
to
its
edges
the
whole
edifice
had
sunk
a
bit
to
one
side
in
the
boggy
soil
it
was
a
far
more
stolid
and
primitive
structure
than
the
barracks
they
scraped
and
hacked
in
front
of
the
entrance
where
two
great
columns
of
stone
six
feet
across
at
the
base
rose
fifty
feet
to
a
supported
arch
the
stones
of
the
building
were
rough
and
unfinished
it
a
temple
geo
suddenly
said
and
again
they
fell
back
to
work
what
spots
of
light
spilled
through
the
twisted
net
of
jungle
stopped
at
the
total
shadow
beneath
the
great
arch
a
line
of
blackness
up
one
side
of
the
basalt
door
showed
that
it
was
ajar
now
they
mounted
the
steps
moving
aside
a
fallen
branch
which
chattered
leaves
at
them
geo
iimmi
then
snake
and
at
last
urson
squeezed
through
the
door
ceiling
blocks
had
fallen
from
the
high
vault
so
that
three
shafts
of
sun
struck
through
the
continual
shift
of
dust
to
the
littered
floor
do
you
think
it
hama
temple
urson
asked
his
voice
came
back
in
the
stone
room
small
and
hollow
i
doubt
it
said
iimmi
at
least
not
the
one
we
supposed
to
find
maybe
it
an
abandoned
one
said
geo
and
we
can
find
out
something
useful
from
it
something
large
and
dark
suddenly
flapped
through
a
far
shaft
of
sun
they
stepped
back
after
a
moment
of
silence
geo
handed
his
jewel
to
snake
make
some
light
in
here
he
said
the
blue
green
glow
flowed
from
the
jewel
in
snake
hand
as
the
light
flared
and
flared
brighter
they
saw
that
the
flapping
had
come
from
a
bird
that
was
perched
harmlessly
on
an
arch
that
ran
between
two
columns
it
ducked
its
head
at
them
cawed
harshly
and
then
flapped
from
its
perch
and
out
one
of
the
apertures
in
the
ceiling
the
sound
of
its
wings
still
thrumming
in
echo
seconds
after
it
was
gone
there
were
doors
between
the
columns
and
one
far
wall
had
not
withstood
time
sledge
a
gaping
rent
was
nearly
blocked
with
vines
except
for
a
dim
shimmer
that
broke
in
here
and
there
through
the
uneven
foliage
behind
a
twisted
metal
rail
and
raised
on
steps
of
stone
the
ruins
of
a
huge
statue
sat
carved
from
black
rock
it
represented
a
man
seated
on
a
dais
an
arm
and
shoulder
had
broken
off
and
lay
in
pieces
on
the
altar
steps
the
hand
its
fingers
as
thick
as
thigh
lay
just
behind
the
altar
rail
the
head
was
completely
missing
both
the
hand
still
on
the
statue
and
the
one
in
front
of
them
on
the
steps
looked
as
though
they
had
once
held
something
but
whatever
it
was
had
been
removed
iimmi
was
moving
along
the
rail
to
where
a
set
of
stone
boxes
were
placed
like
foot
stones
along
the
side
of
the
altar
here
snake
he
called
bring
a
light
over
here
snake
obeyed
and
with
geo
and
urson
help
he
loosened
one
of
the
lids
what
in
there
urson
asked
books
said
iimmi
lifting
out
one
dusty
volume
geo
peered
over
his
shoulder
while
the
dark
fingers
turned
the
pages
old
rituals
iimmi
said
look
here
and
he
pointed
to
one
of
them
you
can
still
read
them
let
me
see
geo
said
you
know
i
studied
with
eadnu
at
the
university
of
olcse
olwnh
iimmi
looked
up
and
laughed
i
thought
some
of
your
ideas
sounded
familiar
i
was
a
pupil
of
welis
you
were
at
olcse
olwnh
too
geo
asked
said
iimmi
turning
the
pages
i
signed
aboard
this
ship
as
a
summer
job
if
i
known
where
we
end
up
i
do
think
i
have
gone
though
stomach
pangs
were
forgotten
these
rituals
are
not
at
all
like
those
of
the
goddess
iimmi
observed
apparently
not
agreed
geo
wait
iimmi
had
been
turning
pages
at
random
look
there
geo
pointed
what
is
it
iimmi
asked
the
lines
geo
said
the
ones
argo
recited
he
read
out
loud
in
the
heart
of
the
dark
oak
the
circlet
of
his
sash
rimmed
where
the
eye
of
hama
broke
with
fire
smoke
and
the
drop
in
the
hand
and
break
the
earth
with
singing
hail
the
height
of
a
man
and
also
the
height
of
a
eyes
have
imprisoned
a
vision
the
ash
tree
dribbles
with
blood
thrust
from
the
gates
of
the
prison
smear
the
yew
tree
with
it
the
other
version
of
the
poem
i
found
in
the
rituals
of
argo
i
wonder
if
there
were
any
more
poems
in
the
old
rituals
of
leptar
that
parallel
those
of
aptor
and
hama
probably
iimmi
said
especially
if
the
first
invasion
from
aptor
took
place
just
before
and
probably
caused
the
purges
what
about
food
urson
suddenly
asked
from
where
he
now
sat
on
the
altar
steps
you
two
scholars
have
the
rest
of
time
to
argue
but
we
may
starve
before
you
can
enjoy
the
leisure
he
right
said
iimmi
besides
we
have
to
get
going
would
you
two
consider
it
an
imposition
to
set
your
minds
to
procuring
us
some
food
urson
asked
wait
a
minute
iimmi
said
here
a
section
on
the
burial
of
the
dead
yes
i
thought
so
he
read
out
loud
now
the
bright
dead
with
misgiving
from
the
of
the
living
what
does
that
mean
asked
urson
it
means
that
the
dead
are
buried
with
all
the
accoutrements
of
the
living
that
means
that
they
put
food
in
the
graves
over
here
cried
iimmi
with
snake
following
they
came
to
the
row
of
sealed
doors
behind
the
columns
along
the
wall
iimmi
looked
at
the
inscription
tombs
he
reported
he
turned
the
handles
a
double
set
of
rings
which
he
twisted
in
opposite
directions
in
an
old
temple
like
this
the
lock
mechanisms
must
have
rusted
by
now
if
they
at
all
like
the
ancient
tombs
of
leptar
have
you
studied
the
ancient
tombs
asked
geo
excitedly
professor
eadnu
always
considered
them
a
waste
of
time
that
all
welis
ever
talked
about
laughed
iimmi
here
urson
you
set
your
back
to
this
a
moment
grumbling
urson
came
forward
took
the
rings
and
twisted
one
snapped
off
in
his
hand
the
other
gave
with
a
crumbling
sound
inside
the
door
i
think
that
does
it
iimmi
said
they
all
helped
pull
now
and
suddenly
the
door
gave
an
inch
and
then
on
the
next
tug
swung
free
snake
proceeded
them
into
the
tiny
stone
cell
on
a
rock
table
lying
on
its
side
was
a
bald
shriveled
sexless
body
around
the
floor
were
a
few
sealed
jars
heaps
of
parchment
and
a
few
piles
of
ornaments
iimmi
moved
among
the
jars
this
one
has
grain
he
said
give
me
a
hand
geo
helped
him
lug
the
big
pottery
vessel
to
the
door
suddenly
a
thin
shriek
scarred
the
dusty
air
and
both
boys
stumbled
the
jar
hit
the
ground
split
and
grain
heaped
over
the
floor
the
shriek
came
again
geo
saw
there
on
the
edge
of
the
broken
wall
across
the
temple
from
them
five
of
the
figures
crouched
before
the
thickly
shingled
leaves
just
visible
in
the
uneven
light
one
leapt
from
the
wall
now
and
ran
wailing
across
the
littered
temple
floor
straight
for
the
door
of
the
tomb
two
others
followed
and
then
two
others
more
had
mounted
the
broken
ridge
of
stone
only
a
greenish
rectangle
of
light
fell
through
the
tomb
door
as
the
loping
forms
burst
into
the
room
one
and
then
its
two
companions
claws
and
teeth
closed
on
the
shriveled
skin
the
body
rolled
beneath
the
ripping
hands
and
mouths
for
one
arm
swept
into
the
air
above
their
lowered
heads
and
humped
backs
it
fell
on
the
edge
of
the
rock
table
broke
at
the
and
the
skeletal
hand
fell
to
the
floor
shattering
like
china
into
a
dozen
pieces
they
backed
to
the
temple
door
then
they
turned
and
ran
down
the
temple
steps
the
sunlight
on
the
broad
rocks
touched
them
they
became
still
breathed
deeply
they
walked
quietly
hunger
returned
slowly
after
that
and
occasionally
one
would
look
aside
into
the
faces
of
the
others
in
attempt
to
identify
the
horror
that
still
pulsed
behind
their
eyes
chapter
vii
it
was
urson
who
first
pointed
it
out
look
at
the
far
bank
he
said
across
from
them
they
could
make
out
an
obviously
stone
embankment
a
few
hundred
feet
further
on
iimmi
sighted
the
spires
above
the
trees
still
across
the
river
from
them
they
could
figure
nothing
for
an
explanation
till
suddenly
the
trees
ceased
on
the
opposite
bank
and
the
buildings
and
towers
of
a
great
city
broke
the
sky
elevated
highways
looped
tower
after
tower
many
of
them
broken
their
ends
dangling
colossaly
to
the
streets
the
docks
of
the
city
just
across
from
them
were
completely
deserted
it
was
geo
who
suggested
perhaps
hama
temple
is
in
there
after
all
argo
largest
temple
is
in
leptar
biggest
city
and
what
city
in
leptar
is
big
breathed
urson
awfully
how
do
we
get
across
asked
iimmi
but
snake
had
already
started
down
to
the
water
i
guess
we
follow
him
said
geo
climbing
down
over
the
rocks
snake
dove
into
the
water
iimmi
geo
and
urson
followed
before
he
had
taken
two
strokes
geo
felt
familiar
hands
suddenly
grasp
his
body
from
below
this
time
he
did
not
fight
and
there
was
a
sudden
sense
of
speed
of
sinking
through
consciousness
then
he
was
bobbing
up
through
chill
water
with
the
rising
embankment
of
stones
to
one
side
and
the
broad
river
to
the
other
he
switched
from
skulling
into
a
crawl
now
wondering
how
to
scale
the
stones
when
he
saw
the
rusted
metal
ladder
leading
into
the
water
he
caught
hold
of
the
sides
and
pulled
himself
up
snake
came
up
now
and
then
urson
and
at
last
iimmi
joined
them
on
the
broad
ridge
of
concrete
that
walled
the
flowing
river
together
now
on
the
wharf
they
turned
to
the
city
near
them
piles
of
debris
lay
between
two
taller
buildings
after
a
few
minutes
walk
the
building
walls
had
reached
canyon
size
now
how
are
you
going
to
go
about
looking
for
the
temple
urson
asked
maybe
we
can
take
a
look
from
the
top
of
one
of
these
buildings
geo
suggested
they
turned
toward
a
random
building
a
slab
of
metal
had
torn
away
from
the
wall
and
stepping
through
they
found
themselves
in
a
huge
hollow
room
dim
light
came
from
a
number
of
white
tubes
set
around
the
wall
only
a
quarter
of
them
were
lit
and
one
was
flickering
hung
from
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
metal
sign
which
read
new
edison
electric
company
and
beneath
it
in
smaller
letters
light
down
the
ages
one
of
the
huge
cylinders
across
the
floor
was
buzzing
as
they
mounted
a
spiral
staircase
to
the
next
floor
the
great
room
turned
about
them
sinking
at
last
they
stepped
up
into
a
dark
corridor
a
red
light
glowed
at
the
end
which
said
exit
doors
outlined
themselves
along
the
hall
in
a
red
haze
geo
moved
to
one
at
random
and
opened
it
natural
light
fell
in
on
them
as
the
others
came
to
see
they
entered
a
room
whose
outer
wall
was
torn
away
the
floor
broke
off
irregularly
over
thrusting
girders
what
could
have
happened
to
it
urson
asked
see
iimmi
explained
that
roadway
must
have
crashed
into
the
wall
and
knocked
it
away
a
ribbon
of
road
veered
into
the
room
at
an
insane
angle
the
railing
was
twisted
but
there
were
the
stalks
of
street
lights
still
intact
along
the
edges
do
you
think
we
could
climb
that
asked
geo
it
does
look
too
steep
for
what
urson
wanted
to
know
to
get
some
place
high
enough
to
see
if
there
anything
that
looks
like
a
temple
oh
said
urson
in
a
reconciled
voice
in
general
the
walk
was
in
good
shape
occasional
sections
of
railing
had
twisted
away
but
the
road
itself
mounted
surely
between
the
sheering
faces
of
the
buildings
on
either
side
of
them
through
advancing
sunset
it
branched
before
them
and
they
went
left
it
branched
again
and
again
they
avoided
the
road
a
sign
half
the
length
of
a
three
masted
ship
hung
lopsidedly
above
them
on
a
building
to
one
side
wmth
the
hub
of
world
news
communication
entertainment
as
they
rounded
the
corner
of
the
building
snake
suddenly
stopped
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
what
is
it
asked
geo
snake
took
a
step
backward
then
he
pointed
to
wmth
what
hurts
asked
iimmi
snake
pointed
to
the
building
again
is
there
someone
in
there
thinking
too
loud
snake
said
a
radio
is
a
thinking
machine
and
there
one
in
there
that
hurting
your
head
interpreted
iimmi
tentatively
and
with
a
question
mark
snake
nodded
how
come
the
one
he
showed
us
before
did
hurt
him
urson
wanted
to
know
iimmi
looked
up
at
the
imposing
housing
of
wmth
maybe
this
one
a
lot
bigger
look
geo
said
to
snake
you
stay
here
and
if
we
see
anything
come
back
and
report
all
right
maybe
it
stops
later
on
urson
said
and
if
he
ran
forward
he
could
get
out
the
other
side
it
may
just
stop
after
a
hundred
feet
or
so
why
so
anxious
asked
iimmi
the
jewels
said
urson
who
going
to
get
us
out
of
trouble
if
we
should
meet
up
with
anything
else
they
were
silent
then
their
shadows
faded
over
the
pavement
as
the
yellow
tinge
in
the
sky
turned
blue
i
guess
it
up
to
snake
geo
said
do
you
think
you
can
make
it
snake
paused
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
well
geo
said
to
the
others
come
on
then
around
them
was
a
sudden
click
and
lights
flickered
all
along
the
edges
of
the
road
come
on
geo
said
again
and
once
more
they
started
passing
the
lights
which
wheeled
double
and
triple
shadows
about
them
over
the
road
and
the
opposite
railing
when
they
reached
the
next
turn
off
that
led
to
a
still
higher
ramp
geo
looked
back
snake
miniature
figure
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
road
railing
his
feet
on
the
lower
rung
one
pair
of
arms
folded
one
pair
of
elbows
on
his
knees
the
light
above
him
keep
track
of
the
turns
said
geo
i
keeping
iimmi
assured
him
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
top
of
whatever
we
trying
to
get
to
the
top
of
rumbled
urson
we
wo
be
able
to
see
anything
it
be
too
dark
then
let
hurry
geo
admonished
sunset
stained
one
side
of
the
towers
copper
while
blue
shadows
hugged
the
other
by
way
of
a
stairway
they
mounted
another
eighty
feet
to
a
broader
highway
where
they
could
look
down
on
the
band
of
lights
which
was
the
one
they
had
just
left
they
were
beginning
to
clear
the
roofs
of
the
lower
buildings
now
on
this
road
fewer
lights
were
working
they
were
just
about
to
enter
a
dark
section
when
a
figure
appeared
in
silhouette
at
the
other
end
they
stopped
but
the
figure
was
suddenly
gone
a
little
farther
geo
suddenly
halted
and
said
there
two
hundred
feet
ahead
of
them
what
may
have
been
a
naked
woman
rose
from
the
ground
and
began
to
walk
backwards
until
she
disappeared
into
the
next
dark
length
of
road
do
you
think
she
was
running
away
from
us
iimmi
asked
urson
reached
out
and
touched
iimmi
jewel
i
wish
we
have
some
more
light
around
here
yeah
iimmi
agreed
they
continued
the
skeleton
lay
at
the
twilight
edge
of
the
next
stretch
of
functioning
lights
the
rib
cage
marked
sharp
lines
on
the
pavement
with
shadow
from
the
lamps
glare
do
we
turn
back
now
urson
asked
a
skeleton
ca
hurt
you
iimmi
said
but
what
about
the
live
one
we
saw
countered
urson
and
here
she
comes
now
geo
whispered
in
a
cynical
stage
voice
in
fact
two
figures
approached
them
through
the
shadow
as
urson
geo
and
iimmi
moved
closer
one
stopped
and
then
the
other
a
few
steps
before
the
first
then
they
dropped
geo
could
tell
if
they
fell
or
lay
down
quickly
on
the
roadway
but
they
seemed
to
have
disappeared
go
on
asked
urson
go
on
said
geo
pause
go
on
from
geo
two
more
skeletons
lay
on
the
road
where
the
figures
had
disappeared
a
minute
before
they
do
seem
dangerous
geo
said
but
what
do
they
do
die
every
time
they
see
us
hey
iimmi
said
what
that
listen
it
was
a
sickly
liquid
sound
like
mud
dropping
into
itself
something
was
falling
from
the
sky
no
not
the
sky
but
from
the
roadway
that
crossed
fifty
feet
above
them
looking
down
again
they
saw
that
a
blob
of
something
was
growing
on
the
pavement
ten
feet
from
them
come
on
geo
said
and
they
skirted
the
mess
dripping
from
above
them
and
continued
up
the
road
passing
four
more
skeletons
the
sound
behind
them
turned
into
a
wet
sloshing
turning
they
saw
it
emerge
into
the
light
shapeless
and
under
the
white
flare
impaling
its
membrane
on
the
skeletons
the
mass
flowed
around
them
faster
covering
them
molding
to
them
there
was
a
final
surge
a
shrinking
and
its
shapelessness
contracted
into
limbs
a
head
feet
the
naked
pushed
itself
to
its
knees
and
then
stood
straight
the
flesh
by
now
opaque
eye
sockets
caved
into
the
face
a
mouth
ripped
apart
on
the
skull
and
the
chest
began
to
move
with
a
wet
steamy
sound
in
irregular
gasps
it
began
to
walk
toward
them
raising
its
hands
from
its
sides
then
behind
it
in
the
darkness
they
saw
more
coming
said
urson
what
do
they
one
or
both
of
two
things
iimmi
answered
backing
away
more
meat
or
more
bones
whoops
geo
said
look
back
there
they
whirled
and
saw
seven
more
figures
standing
quietly
behind
them
while
the
ones
in
front
advanced
a
covered
flight
of
stairs
had
its
entrance
nearby
leading
to
the
next
level
of
highway
they
ducked
into
it
and
fled
up
the
steps
geo
glanced
back
once
one
of
the
forms
had
reached
the
entrance
and
had
started
to
climb
he
was
also
he
realized
high
enough
to
get
some
idea
of
the
city
which
stretched
beyond
the
transparent
covering
of
the
steps
away
in
a
web
of
lighted
roadways
rising
looping
descending
two
glows
caught
him
one
beyond
the
river
a
red
haze
that
flickered
behind
the
trees
and
was
reflected
on
the
water
itself
the
other
was
within
the
city
itself
orange
white
nested
among
the
buildings
he
turned
back
up
the
steps
a
gurgling
sound
neared
them
as
they
reached
the
top
entrance
geo
had
only
gotten
half
clear
of
the
entrance
when
he
yelled
yikes
and
then
duck
they
slipped
from
the
doorway
and
nearly
fell
avoiding
a
mass
of
jelly
the
size
of
a
house
which
flopped
against
the
entrance
they
edged
by
its
pulsing
transparent
sides
the
lamp
light
pierced
into
it
a
yard
and
once
a
skull
swirled
toward
the
surface
and
then
sank
again
suddenly
it
sucked
away
from
the
entrance
and
shivered
ponderously
toward
them
something
was
happening
at
the
front
figures
three
or
four
of
them
were
detaching
themselves
from
the
mother
mass
and
preceding
it
they
turned
and
ran
along
the
road
plunging
suddenly
into
an
extended
darkened
section
a
moment
later
there
was
a
glow
in
front
of
them
and
suddenly
urson
yelled
watch
it
abruptly
the
road
sheered
off
in
front
of
them
they
halted
and
then
approached
the
edge
slowly
the
surface
of
the
road
tore
away
and
the
girders
descended
webbing
toward
the
ruined
stump
of
a
building
from
which
the
glow
rose
the
glow
came
from
the
heart
of
the
edifice
what
do
you
think
it
is
asked
geo
i
do
know
said
iimmi
they
looked
and
in
the
shadow
numberless
figures
were
marching
after
them
suddenly
the
figures
fell
to
the
ground
and
flesh
rolled
forward
from
bone
congealed
and
rose
quiveringly
into
the
edge
of
the
light
iimmi
started
out
first
on
the
skeletal
twisted
structure
that
descended
to
the
glowing
pit
you
crazy
geo
said
the
thing
flopped
forward
another
yard
with
a
sick
sound
hurry
up
geo
added
with
urson
in
the
middle
they
started
out
along
the
wide
girder
lit
from
beneath
their
bodies
were
in
the
shadow
of
the
girder
only
their
outstretched
arms
burned
in
the
pale
orange
light
as
they
balanced
themselves
before
them
faintly
legible
on
the
broken
building
into
which
they
were
descending
was
the
sign
atomic
energy
for
the
betterment
of
man
it
was
flanked
by
two
purple
trefoils
the
beam
twisted
sideways
and
then
dropped
iimmi
made
the
turn
dropped
to
his
knees
and
hands
and
then
started
to
let
himself
down
the
four
feet
to
the
next
small
section
of
concrete
once
he
saw
something
let
out
a
low
whistle
but
continued
to
lower
himself
to
the
straightened
girder
urson
made
the
turn
next
while
geo
knelt
in
front
of
him
when
urson
saw
what
iimmi
had
seen
his
hand
shot
to
geo
chest
and
grabbed
the
jewel
geo
took
his
wrist
that
wo
help
us
now
he
said
urson
expelled
a
breath
and
then
continued
down
slowly
quickly
geo
turned
to
drop
now
the
entire
beam
structure
over
which
they
had
just
come
was
coated
with
a
trembling
thickness
of
the
stuff
globs
dripped
from
the
steel
shafts
glowing
in
the
light
from
below
quivering
smoking
splashing
off
into
the
darkness
here
and
there
something
half
human
would
rise
either
to
look
around
or
to
pull
the
collective
mass
further
on
but
then
it
would
fall
back
and
dissolve
it
bulged
forward
smoking
now
bits
of
it
shriveling
off
and
falling
away
geo
was
about
to
descend
but
suddenly
he
called
wait
a
minute
the
others
stayed
still
it
was
making
progress
it
rolled
to
a
certain
point
in
the
pale
light
globbed
up
smoked
and
fell
away
and
smoked
and
dripped
ca
it
get
any
farther
urson
asked
it
does
look
it
said
geo
a
skeleton
stood
up
in
the
orange
light
it
tottered
its
surface
steaming
and
then
fell
with
a
sucking
noise
down
into
the
hundreds
of
feet
of
shadow
geo
was
holding
tight
onto
the
girder
in
front
of
him
the
pale
light
fell
cleanly
over
his
hand
wrist
and
midway
up
his
forearm
what
happened
now
made
him
squeeze
until
sweat
came
the
entire
gargantuan
mass
which
had
only
extended
tentacles
till
now
pulsed
to
the
edge
of
the
jagged
road
draped
itself
over
the
web
of
girders
and
flung
itself
forward
on
the
spindly
metal
threads
it
careened
toward
them
and
the
three
jerked
themselves
back
then
it
stopped
quivering
it
boiled
it
burned
it
writhed
sinking
smoking
through
the
spaces
in
the
naked
girder
work
it
tried
to
crawl
backwards
human
figures
leaped
from
its
mass
toward
the
edge
of
the
road
missed
and
plummetted
like
smoking
bullets
it
hurled
a
great
pseudopod
back
toward
the
safety
of
the
road
it
fell
short
flopped
downward
and
the
whole
mass
shook
beneath
the
smoke
that
rose
from
it
it
pulled
free
of
the
support
tentacles
sliding
across
steel
whipping
into
the
air
then
it
dropped
into
the
shadows
breaking
into
a
half
dozen
pieces
before
they
lost
sight
of
it
below
geo
released
his
hand
my
arm
hurts
he
said
shaking
it
they
climbed
up
to
the
road
again
carefully
any
ideas
what
happened
asked
iimmi
what
ever
it
was
i
glad
it
did
said
urson
something
clattered
before
them
in
the
darkness
what
was
that
asked
urson
stopping
my
foot
hit
something
geo
said
what
was
it
asked
urson
never
mind
said
geo
come
on
fifteen
minutes
brought
them
to
the
stairway
that
went
to
the
lower
highway
iimmi
memory
proved
good
and
for
an
hour
they
went
quickly
iimmi
making
no
hesitation
it
turnings
god
geo
said
rubbing
his
forearm
with
his
other
hand
i
must
have
pulled
hell
out
of
it
back
there
it
hurts
like
the
devil
urson
looked
at
his
hand
and
rubbed
them
together
my
hands
feel
sort
of
funny
too
iimmi
said
like
they
been
nothing
said
geo
this
hurts
twenty
minutes
later
iimmi
said
well
this
should
be
about
it
hey
said
urson
there
snake
as
they
ran
forward
now
the
boy
jumped
off
the
rail
grabbed
their
shoulders
and
grinned
then
he
began
to
tug
them
forward
you
lucky
little
so
and
so
said
urson
i
wish
you
been
with
us
he
probably
was
in
spirit
if
not
in
body
geo
laughed
snake
nodded
what
are
you
pulling
for
urson
asked
say
if
you
going
to
get
headaches
like
that
you
better
teach
us
what
to
do
with
them
beads
there
he
pointed
to
the
jewel
at
iimmi
and
geo
necks
snake
nodded
and
tugged
forward
again
he
wants
us
to
hurry
geo
said
we
better
get
going
the
road
finally
tore
completely
away
and
four
feet
below
them
over
the
twisted
rail
was
the
mouth
of
a
street
that
led
into
the
waterfront
snake
iimmi
and
then
urson
vaulted
over
urson
shook
his
hands
painfully
when
he
landed
give
me
a
hand
will
you
geo
asked
my
arm
is
really
shot
urson
helped
his
friend
over
almost
as
though
it
had
been
in
wait
thick
liquid
gurgling
sounded
behind
them
like
a
wounded
thing
it
emerged
from
behind
the
broken
highway
bulging
up
into
the
light
which
shone
on
the
ripples
in
its
shriveled
membrane
run
it
bawled
urson
and
they
took
off
down
the
street
in
the
moonlight
the
ruined
piers
spread
along
the
waterfront
to
either
side
of
them
some
even
slanting
into
the
silvered
water
turning
once
they
saw
it
bloat
the
entrance
of
the
street
fill
it
and
then
pour
across
the
broken
stones
slipping
across
the
rubble
of
the
smashed
wharf
when
geo
hit
water
he
was
aware
of
two
things
immediately
as
the
hands
reached
for
his
body
first
the
thong
was
yanked
from
around
his
neck
second
pain
seared
his
arm
as
if
the
bones
and
ligaments
were
suddenly
replaced
by
cords
of
steel
and
every
vein
and
capillary
had
become
part
of
a
webbing
of
red
fire
it
was
a
long
time
before
consciousness
once
he
was
lifted
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
white
moon
was
moving
incredibly
fast
above
him
toward
the
dark
shapes
of
leaves
was
he
being
carried
and
his
arm
hurt
there
was
more
drowsy
half
consciousness
and
once
a
great
deal
of
pain
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream
however
darkness
flowed
in
swathed
his
tongue
and
he
swallowed
the
darkness
down
into
his
body
and
into
his
head
and
called
it
sleep
spool
of
copper
wire
unrolled
over
the
black
tile
floor
scoop
it
up
quick
damn
let
me
get
out
of
here
i
run
past
the
black
columns
glimpsing
the
cavernous
room
and
the
black
statue
at
the
other
end
huge
and
rising
into
shadows
men
in
dark
robes
are
walking
around
not
only
could
they
see
this
time
they
could
hear
the
thinking
just
do
feel
up
to
praying
this
afternoon
i
am
before
the
door
and
above
it
a
black
disk
with
three
white
eyes
on
it
through
the
door
up
black
stone
steps
wonder
if
anyone
will
be
up
there
now
just
my
luck
find
the
old
man
himself
another
door
with
a
black
circle
above
it
push
it
open
slowly
cool
on
my
hands
a
man
is
standing
inside
looking
into
a
large
screen
of
glass
figures
moving
on
it
ca
make
them
out
he
in
the
way
oh
there
another
i
do
know
whether
to
call
it
success
or
failure
one
the
jewels
are
safe
or
lost
what
do
you
call
it
the
first
one
asks
i
do
know
any
more
he
sighs
i
do
think
i
taken
my
eyes
off
this
thing
for
more
than
two
hours
since
they
got
to
the
beach
every
mile
they
come
closer
has
made
my
blood
run
colder
what
do
we
report
to
hama
incarnate
it
would
be
silly
to
say
anything
now
we
just
do
know
well
says
the
other
at
least
we
can
do
something
with
the
city
of
new
hope
since
they
got
rid
of
that
are
you
sure
they
really
got
it
after
the
burning
it
received
over
that
naked
atom
pile
it
was
all
it
could
do
to
get
to
the
waterfront
it
just
about
fried
up
and
blown
away
already
and
how
safe
would
you
call
them
the
other
right
now
i
would
call
them
anything
glitters
on
the
table
by

i
have
me
a
coil
by
the
a
harsh
voice
in
the
distance
and
what
do
you
think
doing
rides
again
nothing
sir
as
metal
and
scraps
and
wires
fly
frantically
into
the
paper
voice
all
novices
under
twenty
must
report
to
afternoon
services
without
fail
yes
sir
coming
right
along
sir
paper
bag
jammed
equally
frantically
into
the
folds
of
my
robe
not
a
moment
peace
not
a
moment
through
the
garden
with
lowered
eyes
past
a
priest
with
a
small
paunch
there
are
mirrors
along
the
vestibule
huge
slabs
of
glass
that
rise
thirty
feet
reflecting
the
blue
and
yellow
light
back
and
forth
from
the
colored
windows
of
the
temple
in
the
mirror
i
see
pass
a
priest
proceeded
by
a
smaller
figure
with
short
red
hair
and
a
spray
of
freckles
over
a
flattish
nose
and
as
we
pass
into
prayer
there
is
the
maddening
almost
inaudible
jingling
of
metal
scraps
muffled
by
the
dark
geo
woke
up
and
almost
everything
was
white
chapter
viii
the
pale
woman
with
the
tiny
eyes
rose
from
over
him
her
hair
dropped
like
white
silk
threads
over
her
shoulders
you
are
awake
she
asked
do
you
understand
me
am
i
at
at
hama
temple
he
asked
the
remnants
of
the
dream
still
blowing
in
at
the
edges
of
his
mind
like
shredding
cloth
my
friends
where
are
they
the
woman
laughed
your
friends
are
all
right
you
came
out
the
worst
another
laugh
you
ask
if
this
is
hama
temple
but
you
can
see
can
you
not
you
have
eyes
do
you
recognize
the
color
of
the
white
goddess
argo
geo
looked
around
the
room
it
was
white
marble
and
there
was
no
direct
source
of
light
the
walls
simply
glowed
my
friends
geo
said
again
they
are
fine
we
were
able
to
completely
restore
their
flesh
to
health
they
must
have
exposed
their
hands
to
the
direct
beam
of
the
radiation
for
only
a
few
seconds
but
the
whole
first
half
of
your
arm
had
apparently
lain
in
the
deadly
rays
for
some
minutes
you
were
not
as
lucky
as
they
another
thought
rushed
geo
mind
now
the
jewels
he
started
to
say
but
instead
of
sounding
the
words
he
reached
to
his
throat
with
both
hands
one
fell
on
his
naked
chest
and
there
was
something
very
wrong
with
the
other
he
sat
up
in
the
bed
quickly
and
looked
down
my
arm
he
said
swathed
in
white
bandages
the
limb
ended
some
foot
and
a
half
short
of
where
it
should
have
my
arm
he
asked
again
with
a
child
bewilderment
what
happened
to
my
arm
i
tried
to
tell
you
the
woman
said
softly
we
had
to
amputate
half
of
your
arm
if
we
had
not
you
would
have
died
my
arm
geo
said
again
and
lay
back
in
the
bed
it
is
difficult
the
woman
said
it
is
only
a
little
consolation
i
know
but
we
are
blind
here
what
burned
your
arm
away
took
our
sight
from
us
when
it
was
much
stronger
generations
ago
we
learned
how
to
battle
many
of
its
effects
and
had
we
not
rescued
you
from
the
river
all
of
you
would
have
died
you
are
men
who
know
the
religion
of
argo
and
adhere
to
it
this
another
of
your
party
has
told
us
be
thankful
then
that
you
have
come
under
the
wing
of
the
mother
goddess
again
for
this
is
a
hostile
country
she
paused
do
you
wish
to
talk
geo
shook
his
head
i
hear
the
sheets
rustle
the
woman
said
smiling
which
means
you
either
shook
or
nodded
your
head
i
know
from
my
study
of
the
old
customs
that
one
means
and
the
other
but
you
must
have
patience
with
us
who
can
not
see
we
are
not
used
to
your
people
do
you
wish
to
talk
she
repeated
oh
said
geo
no
no
i
do
very
well
the
woman
said
she
rose
still
smiling
i
will
return
later
she
walked
to
a
wall
in
which
a
door
slipped
open
and
then
it
closed
again
behind
her
he
lay
still
on
the
bed
for
a
long
time
then
he
turned
over
on
his
stomach
once
he
brought
the
stump
under
his
chest
and
held
the
clean
bandages
in
his
other
hand
very
quickly
he
let
go
and
stretched
the
limb
sideways
as
far
as
possible
away
from
him
that
did
work
either
so
he
moved
it
back
down
to
his
side
and
let
it
lay
by
him
under
the
white
sheet
after
a
long
while
he
got
up
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looked
around
the
room
it
was
completely
bare
with
neither
windows
nor
visible
doors
he
went
to
the
spot
through
which
she
had
exited
but
could
find
not
seam
or
crack
his
tunic
he
saw
had
been
washed
pressed
and
laid
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
slipped
it
over
his
head
fumbling
with
only
one
arm
getting
the
belt
together
started
out
to
be
a
problem
but
he
hooked
the
buckle
around
one
finger
and
maneuvered
the
strap
through
with
the
other
he
adjusted
his
leather
purse
now
empty
on
his
side
then
he
saw
that
the
sword
was
gone
an
unreal
feeling
white
like
the
walls
of
the
room
was
beginning
to
fill
him
up
like
a
pale
mixture
of
milk
and
water
he
walked
around
the
edge
of
the
room
once
more
looking
for
some
break
there
was
a
sound
behind
him
and
the
woman
in
her
white
robe
stood
in
a
triangular
doorway
you
dressed
she
smiled
good
are
you
too
tired
to
come
with
me
you
will
eat
and
see
your
friends
if
you
feel
well
enough
or
i
can
have
the
food
brought
i
come
geo
said
she
turned
and
he
followed
her
into
a
hall
of
the
same
luminous
substance
her
heels
touched
the
back
of
her
white
robe
with
each
step
but
she
was
silent
his
own
bare
feet
on
the
cool
stones
seemed
louder
than
those
of
the
blind
woman
before
him
suddenly
he
was
in
a
larger
room
with
benches
it
was
a
chapel
obviously
of
argo
because
of
the
altar
at
the
far
end
but
its
detail
was
strange
everything
was
arranged
with
the
white
simplicity
that
one
would
expect
of
a
people
to
whom
visual
adornment
meant
nothing
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
as
the
woman
said
wait
here
she
disappeared
down
another
hall
suddenly
the
woman
returned
from
the
other
hallway
followed
by
snake
geo
and
the
boy
looked
at
each
other
silently
as
the
woman
disappeared
again
a
wish
like
a
living
thing
suddenly
writhed
into
a
knot
in
geo
stomach
that
the
boy
would
say
something
he
himself
could
not
again
she
returned
this
time
with
urson
the
big
man
stepped
into
the
chapel
saw
geo
and
exclaimed
friend
what
happened
he
came
to
him
quickly
and
placed
his
warm
hands
on
geo
shoulders
what
he
began
and
shook
his
head
geo
grinned
suddenly
and
patted
his
stump
with
his
good
hand
i
guess
got
something
from
me
after
all
urson
held
his
own
forearm
next
to
geo
and
compared
them
there
was
paleness
in
both
i
guess
none
of
us
got
out
completely
all
right
i
woke
up
once
while
they
were
taking
the
scabs
off
it
was
pretty
bad
and
i
went
to
sleep
again
fast
iimmi
came
in
now
well
i
was
wondering
he
stopped
and
let
out
a
low
whistle
i
guess
it
really
got
you
brother
his
own
arms
looked
as
though
they
had
been
dipped
in
bleach
up
to
the
mid
forearms
how
did
this
happen
urson
asked
when
we
were
back
doing
our
tightrope
act
on
those
damn
girders
explained
iimmi
our
bodies
were
in
the
shadow
of
the
girders
and
the
rays
only
got
to
our
arms
i
got
something
you
be
interested
in
too
geo
just
tell
me
where
the
hell
we
are
urson
said
we
in
a
monastery
sacred
to
argo
iimmi
told
him
it
across
the
river
from
the
city
of
new
hope
which
is
where
we
were
that
name
sounds
familiar
in
the
began
urson
snake
gave
him
a
quick
glance
and
he
stopped
and
then
frowned
we
knew
of
your
presence
in
the
city
of
new
hope
explained
the
blind
priestess
and
we
found
you
by
the
riverside
after
you
swam
across
you
managed
to
cling
to
life
long
enough
for
us
to
get
you
back
to
the
monastery
and
apply
what
art
we
could
to
sooth
the
burns
from
the
deadly
fire
geo
suddenly
saw
that
there
was
no
jewel
around
iimmi
neck
either
he
could
almost
feel
the
hands
ripping
it
from
his
neck
in
the
water
iimmi
must
have
made
the
same
discovery
because
his
pale
hand
raised
to
his
own
chest
the
priestess
beckoned
and
started
down
another
hall
and
again
they
followed
they
arrived
at
an
even
larger
room
this
one
set
with
white
marble
benches
and
long
white
tables
this
is
the
main
dining
room
of
the
monastery
their
guide
explained
one
table
has
been
set
up
for
you
you
will
not
eat
with
the
other
priestesses
of
course
why
not
asked
iimmi
surprise
flowed
across
the
blind
face
you
are
men
she
told
them
matter
of
factly
then
she
led
them
to
a
table
where
wine
meat
and
bowls
piled
with
strange
fruit
were
placed
as
they
sat
down
she
disappeared
once
more
geo
reached
for
a
knife
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
at
the
table
as
the
nub
of
the
arm
jutted
over
food
i
guess
i
just
have
to
learn
he
said
after
the
pause
halfway
through
the
meal
urson
said
what
about
the
jewels
did
the
priestess
take
them
from
you
they
came
off
in
the
water
said
iimmi
geo
nodded
corroboration
well
now
we
really
have
a
problem
said
urson
here
we
are
at
a
temple
of
argo
where
we
could
return
the
jewels
and
maybe
even
get
back
to
the
priestess
on
the
ship
and
out
of
the
silly
mess
and
the
jewels
are
gone
i
guess
that
also
means
our
river
friends
are
working
for
hama
said
geo
well
iimmi
said
hama
got
his
jewel
then
and
we
out
of
the
way
perhaps
he
delivered
us
into
argo
hands
as
a
reward
for
bringing
them
this
far
since
we
would
have
died
anyway
said
geo
i
guess
he
was
doing
us
a
favor
and
you
know
what
that
means
iimmi
said
looking
at
snake
now
huh
asked
urson
then
he
said
oh
let
the
boy
speak
for
himself
all
right
four
arms
are
you
or
are
you
not
a
spy
for
hama
a
pained
expression
came
over
snake
face
and
he
shook
his
head
not
in
denial
but
bewilderment
suddenly
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
ran
from
the
room
urson
looked
at
the
others
now
do
tell
me
i
hurt
his
feelings
by
asking
you
did
said
iimmi
but
i
may
have
i
keep
on
forgetting
that
he
can
read
minds
what
do
you
mean
urson
asked
just
when
you
asked
him
that
a
lot
of
things
came
together
in
my
mind
that
would
be
pretty
vicious
for
him
if
any
of
it
were
true
huh
asked
urson
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
said
geo
i
still
it
means
that
he
is
a
spy
explained
iimmi
and
among
other
things
he
was
probably
lying
about
the
radio
back
at
the
city
and
that
cost
geo
his
arm
why
the
began
urson
and
then
looked
down
the
hall
where
snake
had
disappeared
they
did
eat
much
more
when
they
got
up
urson
felt
sleepy
and
was
shown
back
to
his
room
may
i
show
my
friend
what
you
showed
me
iimmi
asked
the
priestess
when
she
returned
he
is
also
a
student
of
rituals
of
course
you
may
smiled
the
priestess
a
door
opened
and
they
entered
another
room
similar
to
the
one
in
which
geo
had
awakened
as
she
was
about
to
leave
iimmi
asked
wait
can
you
tell
us
how
to
leave
the
room
ourselves
why
would
you
want
to
leave
she
asked
for
exercise
offered
geo
and
to
observe
the
working
of
the
monastery
believe
us
we
are
true
students
of
argo
religion
simply
press
the
wall
with
your
hand
level
at
your
waist
and
the
door
will
open
but
you
must
not
wander
about
the
monastery
rites
which
are
not
for
your
eyes
are
being
carried
out
not
for
your
eyes
she
repeated
strange
this
is
a
phrase
that
has
never
left
our
language
suddenly
confronted
by
people
who
can
see
it
makes
me
feel
somehow
she
paused
well
that
is
how
to
leave
the
room
she
stepped
out
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
here
said
iimmi
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
show
you
on
his
bed
were
a
pile
of
books
old
but
legible
geo
flipped
through
a
few
pages
suddenly
he
looked
up
at
iimmi
hey
what
are
they
doing
with
books
question
number
one
said
iimmi
now
for
question
number
two
look
here
he
reached
over
geo
shoulder
and
hastened
him
to
one
page
why
it
the
began
geo
you
darn
right
it
is
said
iimmi
hymn
to
the
goddess
argo
in
the
eye
of
the
bright
ash
there
the
heart
of
argo
broke
and
the
hand
of
the
goddess
would
dash
through
the
head
of
flame
and
the
the
grain
speck
in
the
hand
and
batter
the
stars
with
singing
hail
the
height
of
a
man
and
also
the
height
of
a
eyes
have
imprisoned
a
vision
the
dribbles
with
blood
thrust
from
the
gates
of
the
prison
smear
the
with
that
must
be
the
full
version
of
the
poem
i
found
the
missing
stanza
to
back
in
the
library
at
leptar
as
i
was
saying
said
iimmi
question
number
two
what
is
the
relation
between
the
rituals
of
hama
and
the
old
rituals
of
argo
apparently
this
particular
branch
of
the
religion
of
the
goddess
underwent
no
purge
and
no
one
at
olcse
olwnh
was
supposed
to
know
about
them
i
wonder
why
geo
asked
that
is
question
number
three
how
did
you
get
a
hold
of
them
well
said
iimmi
i
sort
of
suspected
they
might
be
here
so
i
just
asked
for
them
and
i
think
i
got
some
answers
to
those
questions
fine
go
ahead
we
start
from
three
go
back
to
one
and
then
on
to
two
nice
and
orderly
said
iimmi
why
was
anybody
supposed
to
know
about
the
rituals
simply
because
they
were
so
similar
to
the
rituals
of
hama
you
remember
some
of
the
others
we
found
in
the
abandoned
temple
if
you
do
you
can
refresh
your
memory
right
here
the
two
sets
of
rituals
run
almost
parallel
except
for
a
name
changed
here
a
color
switched
from
black
to
white
a
switch
in
the
vegetative
symbolism
i
guess
what
happened
was
that
when
hama
forces
invaded
leptar
five
hundred
years
ago
it
did
take
leptar
long
to
find
out
the
similarity
from
the
looks
of
the
city
of
new
hope
i
think
it
safe
to
assume
that
at
one
time
or
another
say
five
hundred
years
ago
aptor
civilization
was
far
higher
than
leptar
and
probably
would
have
had
too
hard
a
time
beating
her
in
an
invasion
so
when
leptar
captured
the
first
jewel
and
somehow
did
manage
to
repel
aptor
the
priests
of
leptar
assumed
that
the
safest
way
to
avoid
infiltration
by
hama
and
aptor
again
would
be
to
make
the
rituals
of
the
two
as
different
as
possible
from
the
ones
of
their
enemy
hama
the
ghouls
the
bats
they
parallel
the
stories
i
heard
other
sailors
tell
too
closely
to
be
accidents
how
many
people
do
you
think
have
been
shipwrecked
on
aptor
and
gotten
far
enough
into
the
place
to
see
what
we
seen
and
then
gotten
off
again
to
tell
about
it
i
can
think
of
two
said
geo
huh
said
iimmi
snake
and
jordde
answered
geo
remember
that
argo
said
there
had
been
spies
from
aptor
before
and
jordde
is
definitely
one
and
i
guess
so
is
snake
true
enough
said
iimmi
i
guess
that
fits
into
rule
number
one
he
got
up
from
the
bed
come
on
let
take
a
walk
i
want
to
see
some
sunlight
they
went
to
the
wall
geo
pressed
it
and
a
triangular
panel
slipped
back
when
they
had
rounded
four
or
five
turns
of
hallway
geo
said
i
hope
you
can
remember
where
we
been
i
got
a
more
or
less
perfect
memory
for
directions
iimmi
said
suddenly
the
passage
opened
onto
steps
and
they
were
looking
out
upon
a
huge
unrelieved
white
chamber
down
a
set
of
thirty
marble
steps
priestesses
filed
below
them
in
rows
their
heads
fixed
blindly
forward
at
the
far
end
was
a
raised
dais
with
a
mammoth
statue
of
a
kneeling
woman
sculptured
of
the
same
effulgent
agate
material
where
do
these
women
come
from
whispered
geo
and
where
do
they
keep
the
men
iimmi
shrugged
suddenly
the
figure
of
the
blind
priestess
was
beside
them
excuse
me
iimmi
said
sensing
her
disapproval
of
their
presence
we
did
mean
to
be
disrespectful
but
we
are
creatures
who
are
used
to
natural
day
and
night
we
are
used
to
fresh
air
green
things
this
underground
whiteness
is
oppressive
to
us
and
makes
us
restless
is
there
any
way
that
you
could
show
us
a
way
into
the
open
there
is
not
returned
the
blind
priestess
quietly
and
motioned
them
to
follow
her
from
the
chamber
besides
night
is
coming
on
and
you
are
not
creatures
who
relish
darkness
the
night
air
and
the
quiet
of
evening
is
refreshing
to
us
countered
iimmi
what
do
you
know
of
the
night
answered
the
priestess
with
faint
cynicism
in
her
low
voice
now
they
reached
the
chapel
where
the
friends
had
first
met
after
their
rescue
what
can
you
tell
us
about
the
dark
god
hama
geo
asked
the
blind
priestess
shrugged
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
there
is
little
to
say
today
he
is
a
fiction
he
does
not
exist
there
is
only
argo
the
one
white
goddess
but
we
heard
geo
began
you
were
at
his
abandoned
temple
said
the
priestess
you
saw
yourselves
that
is
all
that
is
left
of
hama
ghouls
prey
on
the
dust
of
his
dead
saints
perhaps
somewhere
behind
the
burning
mountain
a
few
of
his
disciples
are
left
but
hama
is
dead
in
aptor
you
have
seen
the
remains
of
his
city
the
city
of
new
hope
you
have
also
been
the
first
ones
to
go
in
and
return
in
nearly
five
hundred
years
is
that
how
long
the
city
has
been
in
ruin
asked
geo
it
is
what
can
you
tell
us
about
the
city
iimmi
said
the
priestess
sighed
again
there
was
a
time
she
began
generations
ago
when
hama
was
a
high
god
in
aptor
he
had
many
temples
monasteries
and
convents
devoted
to
him
we
had
few
except
for
these
religious
sanctuaries
the
land
was
barbaric
wild
uninhabitable
for
the
most
part
there
had
once
been
cities
in
aptor
but
these
had
been
destroyed
even
earlier
by
the
great
fire
all
that
we
had
was
a
fantastic
record
of
an
unbelievable
time
before
the
rain
of
flame
of
tremendous
power
vast
science
and
a
towering
though
degenerate
civilization
these
records
were
extensive
and
entirely
housed
within
the
monasteries
outside
the
monasteries
there
was
only
chaos
where
half
the
children
were
born
dead
and
the
other
half
deformed
and
with
the
monstrous
races
that
sprang
up
over
the
island
now
as
a
reminder
to
us
we
declared
that
the
magic
contained
in
these
chronicles
was
evil
and
must
never
be
released
to
the
world
again
but
the
priests
of
hama
decided
to
use
the
information
in
these
chronicles
spread
it
to
the
people
and
declared
they
would
not
commit
the
same
mistakes
that
had
brought
the
great
fire
they
opened
the
books
and
the
city
of
new
hope
grew
on
the
far
shore
of
the
river
they
made
giant
machines
that
flew
through
the
air
they
constructed
immense
boats
which
could
sink
into
the
sea
and
emerge
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
another
harbor
in
another
land
they
even
harnessed
for
beneficial
use
the
fire
metal
uranium
which
had
brought
such
terror
to
the
world
before
and
had
brought
down
the
flames
but
they
made
the
same
mistake
as
the
people
before
the
great
fire
made
suggested
iimmi
not
exactly
said
the
priestess
that
is
they
were
not
so
stupid
as
to
misuse
the
fire
metal
which
ravaged
the
world
so
harshly
before
history
is
cyclic
not
repetitive
a
new
power
was
discovered
that
dwarfed
the
significance
of
the
fire
metal
it
could
do
all
that
the
fire
metal
could
do
and
more
efficiently
destroy
cities
or
warm
chilly
huts
in
winter
but
it
could
also
work
on
men
minds
they
say
that
before
the
great
fire
men
wandered
the
streets
of
the
cities
terrified
that
flames
would
descend
on
them
any
moment
and
destroy
them
they
panicked
bought
flimsy
useless
contraptions
to
guard
themselves
from
the
fire
geo
iimmi
have
you
any
idea
how
terrifying
it
would
be
to
know
that
while
walking
the
streets
at
any
moment
your
mind
might
be
snatched
from
you
raped
violated
and
left
broken
in
your
own
skull
only
three
of
these
instruments
were
constructed
but
the
moment
their
existence
was
made
known
by
a
few
fantastic
demonstrations
the
city
of
new
hope
began
the
swerve
down
the
arc
of
its
own
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
ended
with
the
broken
wreck
you
escaped
from
last
night
during
that
year
invasions
were
launched
on
the
backward
nations
across
the
sea
with
whom
months
before
there
had
been
friendly
trade
civil
wars
broke
out
and
internal
struggles
caused
the
invasions
to
fall
back
to
the
homeland
the
instruments
were
hopelessly
lost
but
not
before
the
bird
machines
had
even
dropped
bombs
on
the
city
of
new
hope
itself
the
house
of
the
fire
metal
was
broken
open
to
release
its
death
once
more
for
a
hundred
years
after
the
end
say
our
records
the
city
flamed
with
light
from
the
destroyed
power
house
during
the
first
hundred
years
more
and
more
of
our
number
were
born
blind
because
of
the
sinking
fire
in
the
city
at
last
we
moved
underground
but
it
was
too
late
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
so
you
see
hama
destroyed
himself
today
loyal
to
argo
are
all
the
beasts
of
the
air
of
the
land
and
of
the
water
what
about
the
the
three
instruments
geo
asked
what
happened
to
them
the
blind
priestess
turned
to
him
your
guess
she
said
smiling
is
as
good
as
mine
she
turned
again
and
glided
softly
from
the
room
when
she
left
iimmi
said
something
is
fishy
but
what
is
it
said
geo
well
for
one
thing
said
iimmi
we
know
there
is
a
hama
from
the
dream
i
would
say
that
it
just
about
the
size
and
organization
of
this
place
just
how
big
is
this
place
anyway
geo
asked
want
to
do
some
more
exploring
sure
he
answered
do
you
think
she
does
know
about
hama
but
was
just
pretending
could
be
said
iimmi
they
started
off
down
another
corridor
that
bit
about
going
into
men
minds
with
the
jewels
iimmi
went
on
it
gives
me
the
creeps
it
a
creepy
thing
to
watch
said
geo
argo
used
it
on
snake
the
first
time
we
saw
her
it
just
turns
you
into
an
automaton
then
it
really
is
our
jewels
she
was
talking
about
stairs
cut
a
white
tunnel
into
the
wall
before
them
and
they
mounted
upward
coming
finally
to
another
corridor
they
turned
down
it
and
for
the
first
time
saw
recognizable
doors
in
the
wall
hey
said
iimmi
maybe
one
of
these
goes
outside
fine
said
geo
this
place
is
beginning
to
get
me
he
pushed
open
a
door
and
stepped
in
except
for
the
flowing
white
walls
it
duplicated
in
miniature
the
basement
of
the
new
edison
building
twin
dynamos
whirred
and
the
walls
were
laced
with
pipes
nothing
in
here
said
iimmi
they
tried
a
door
across
the
hall
now
in
this
one
sat
a
white
porcelain
table
and
floor
to
ceiling
cases
of
glittering
instruments
i
bet
this
is
the
room
your
arm
came
off
in
iimmi
said
probably
replied
geo
they
came
out
and
continued
even
farther
in
the
next
room
the
glow
was
dimmer
and
there
was
dust
on
the
walls
iimmi
ran
his
finger
over
it
and
looked
at
the
gray
crescent
left
on
the
bleached
flesh
two
huge
screens
leaned
out
from
the
face
of
a
metal
machine
a
few
dials
and
a
glass
meter
hung
beneath
each
two
yard
of
opaque
glass
in
front
of
each
was
a
stand
which
held
something
like
a
set
of
binoculars
and
what
looked
like
a
pair
of
ear
muffs
i
bet
this
place
has
been
used
since
before
these
girls
went
blind
said
geo
it
looks
it
iimmi
said
he
stepped
up
to
one
of
the
screens
the
one
with
the
fewer
dials
on
it
and
turned
a
switch
what
did
you
do
that
for
geo
asked
why
not
said
iimmi
suddenly
a
flickering
of
colored
lights
ran
over
the
screen
swellings
of
blue
green
shiny
scarlets
they
blinked
that
the
first
color
i
seen
since
i
been
here
iimmi
said
the
colors
grayed
dimmed
congealed
into
forms
and
in
a
moment
they
were
looking
at
a
bare
white
room
in
which
stood
two
barefoot
young
men
one
was
a
dark
negro
with
pale
hands
the
other
had
an
unruly
shock
of
black
hair
and
only
one
arm
hey
gestured
iimmi
and
the
figure
on
the
screen
gestured
too
that
us
he
walked
forward
and
the
corresponding
figure
advanced
on
the
screen
he
flicked
a
dial
and
the
figures
exploded
into
colors
and
then
focused
again
what
that
asked
iimmi
in
a
room
stood
three
of
the
blind
women
on
one
wall
was
a
smaller
screen
similar
to
the
one
in
their
own
room
the
women
of
course
were
oblivious
to
the
picture
on
it
but
it
was
the
picture
on
the
screen
that
had
stopped
geo
it
was
a
face
a
man
face
one
of
the
women
had
on
an
ear
muff
apparatus
and
was
talking
into
a
small
metal
rod
which
she
carried
with
her
as
she
paced
but
the
picture
do
you
recognize
him
demanded
geo
it
jordde
exclaimed
iimmi
they
must
have
gotten
in
contact
with
our
ship
and
are
arranging
to
send
us
back
i
wish
i
could
hear
what
they
saying
said
geo
iimmi
looked
around
and
then
picked
up
the
metal
ear
muffs
from
the
stand
in
front
of
the
screen
that
what
she
seems
to
be
listening
through
said
iimmi
referring
to
the
priestess
in
the
picture
try
them
go
on
he
helped
geo
fit
them
over
his
ears
hear
anything
geo
listened
yes
of
course
the
priestess
was
saying
she
is
set
upon
staying
in
the
harbor
for
three
more
days
to
wait
out
the
week
reported
jordde
i
am
sure
she
will
not
remain
any
longer
she
is
still
bewildered
by
me
and
the
men
have
become
uneasy
and
may
well
mutiny
if
she
stays
longer
we
will
dispose
of
the
prisoners
this
evening
there
is
no
chance
of
their
returning
stated
the
priestess
detain
them
for
three
days
and
i
do
not
care
what
you
do
with
them
said
jordde
she
does
not
have
the
jewels
she
does
not
know
my
our
power
she
will
be
sure
to
leave
at
the
end
of
the
week
it
a
pity
we
have
no
jewels
for
all
our
trouble
said
the
priestess
but
at
least
all
three
are
back
in
aptor
and
potentially
within
our
grasp
jordde
laughed
and
hama
never
seems
to
be
able
to
keep
hold
of
them
for
more
then
ten
minutes
before
they
slip
from
him
again
yours
is
not
to
judge
either
hama
or
argo
stated
the
priestess
you
are
kept
on
by
us
only
to
do
your
job
do
it
report
and
do
not
trouble
either
us
or
yourself
with
opinions
they
are
not
appreciated
yes
mistress
returned
jordde
then
farewell
until
next
report
she
flipped
a
switch
and
the
picture
on
the
little
screen
went
gray
geo
turned
from
the
big
screen
now
and
was
just
about
to
remove
the
hearing
apparatus
when
he
heard
the
priestess
say
go
prepare
the
prisoners
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
rising
moon
they
have
seen
enough
the
woman
left
the
room
geo
finished
removing
the
phones
and
iimmi
looked
at
him
what
the
matter
geo
turned
the
switch
that
darkened
the
screen
when
are
they
coming
to
get
us
iimmi
asked
excitedly
right
now
probably
geo
said
then
as
best
he
could
he
repeated
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
to
iimmi
whose
expression
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
as
geo
went
on
at
the
end
the
bewilderment
suddenly
flared
into
frayed
indignation
why
demanded
iimmi
why
should
we
be
sacrificed
what
is
it
seen
too
much
of
what
is
it
we
know
this
is
the
second
time
it
come
close
to
getting
me
killed
and
i
wish
to
hell
i
knew
what
i
was
supposed
to
know
we
got
to
find
urson
and
get
out
of
here
said
geo
hey
wrong
the
indignation
had
turned
into
something
else
now
iimmi
stood
with
his
eyes
shut
tight
and
his
face
screwed
up
suddenly
he
relaxed
i
just
thought
out
a
message
as
loud
as
i
could
for
snake
to
get
up
here
and
to
bring
urson
if
he
anywhere
around
but
snake
a
spy
for
for
hama
said
iimmi
and
you
know
something
i
do
care
he
closed
his
eyes
again
after
a
few
moments
he
opened
them
well
if
he
coming
he
coming
let
get
going
but
why
began
geo
following
iimmi
out
the
door
because
i
have
a
poet
feeling
that
some
fancy
mind
reading
may
come
in
handy
they
hurried
down
the
hall
found
the
stairs
ducked
down
and
ran
along
the
lower
hall
rounding
a
second
corner
they
emerged
into
the
little
chapel
simultaneously
with
urson
and
snake
i
guess
i
got
through
said
iimmi
which
way
do
we
go
gentlemen
gentlemen
came
a
voice
from
behind
them
snake
took
off
down
one
of
the
passages
and
they
followed
urson
looking
particularly
bewildered
the
priestess
glided
behind
them
calling
softly
please
my
friends
come
back
return
with
me
find
out
from
her
how
the
hell
to
get
out
of
this
place
iimmi
bawled
up
to
snake
the
boy
suddenly
darted
up
a
flight
of
stairs
turned
a
corner
and
darted
up
another
they
came
out
on
a
hall
and
followed
snake
to
the
end
all
four
of
the
boy
hands
flew
at
the
door
handle
turning
it
carefully
this
way
and
back
two
three
seconds
geo
glanced
back
and
saw
the
priestess
mount
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
begin
to
come
toward
them
she
seemed
to
float
her
white
robes
flaring
out
from
her
brushing
at
the
walls
the
door
came
open
they
broke
through
leaves
and
were
momentarily
standing
in
a
huge
field
of
grass
surrounded
by
woods
the
night
was
fully
lit
by
the
moon
as
they
ran
through
the
grass
geo
turned
to
look
behind
him
the
blind
priestess
had
slowed
her
white
face
turned
to
the
moon
her
hands
went
to
her
throat
she
unclasped
her
robe
and
the
first
layer
fell
away
behind
her
as
she
came
on
the
second
layer
began
to
unfold
wet
deathly
white
spreading
growing
to
her
arms
articulating
itself
along
the
white
spines
then
with
a
horribly
familiar
shriek
she
leapt
from
the
ground
and
soared
upward
her
white
wings
hammering
the
air
they
fled
and
other
dark
forms
were
shadowing
the
moon
the
priestesses
across
the
field
joined
her
aloft
in
the
sky
she
overtook
the
running
figures
turned
above
them
and
swooped
the
moon
lanced
white
along
bared
fangs
the
night
breeze
touched
pale
furry
breasts
filled
the
bellying
wings
only
the
tiny
darting
blind
eyes
were
red
rubied
in
a
whirl
of
white
they
crashed
into
the
protective
bushes
where
the
winged
things
could
not
follow
branches
raked
his
face
as
he
ran
behind
the
sound
the
others
made
once
he
thought
he
had
lost
them
but
a
second
later
he
bumped
against
iimmi
who
had
stopped
behind
snake
and
urson
in
the
darkness
above
the
trees
was
a
sound
like
beaten
cloth
diminishing
growing
but
constant
as
once
more
they
began
to
trod
through
the
tangled
darkness
what
the
hell
iimmi
finally
breathed
softly
after
a
minute
of
walking
you
know
it
beginning
to
make
sense
geo
said
his
hand
on
shoulder
remember
that
we
met
and
that
blob
in
the
city
the
only
thing
we
met
on
this
place
that
ca
change
shape
is
the
ghouls
i
think
most
animals
on
this
island
undergo
some
sort
of
metamorphosis
what
about
those
first
flying
things
we
met
whispered
urson
they
did
change
into
anything
we
have
probably
just
been
guests
of
the
female
of
the
species
said
geo
you
mean
those
others
could
have
changed
into
men
too
if
they
wanted
urson
asked
if
they
wanted
answered
geo
in
front
of
them
now
appeared
faint
shiftings
of
silver
light
five
minutes
later
they
were
crouching
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
looking
down
over
the
rocks
at
the
white
shimmerings
over
the
river
into
the
water
geo
asked
snake
shook
his
head
came
the
familiar
sound
in
their
heads
suddenly
a
hand
raised
from
the
water
wet
and
green
it
stood
a
foot
or
so
from
the
shore
in
the
silver
ripples
the
chain
and
the
leather
thong
dangled
down
the
wrist
and
swaying
there
were
two
bright
beads
of
light
iimmi
and
geo
froze
urson
said
the
jewels
suddenly
crouched
low
like
an
animal
the
big
man
sprang
onto
the
rocks
and
ran
toward
the
river
edge
three
shadows
one
white
two
dark
converged
above
him
cutting
the
moonlight
away
from
him
if
he
saw
them
he
did
not
stop
iimmi
and
geo
stood
up
from
their
crouched
positions
urson
reached
the
shore
threw
himself
along
the
rock
and
swiped
at
the
hand
instantly
he
was
covered
by
flailing
wings
the
membranous
sails
splashed
in
the
water
two
seconds
later
urson
rolled
from
beneath
the
layers
of
membrane
that
still
struggled
half
on
land
and
half
in
the
water
he
started
forward
up
the
rocks
he
slipped
regained
his
footing
and
then
came
on
nearly
falling
into
geo
and
iimmi
waiting
arms
the
jewels
urson
breathed
the
struggle
continued
a
minute
longer
on
the
water
something
was
holding
them
down
twisting
at
them
then
suddenly
the
creatures
stilled
and
like
great
leaves
the
three
forms
drifted
apart
caught
quietly
in
the
current
and
floated
away
from
the
rocks
then
two
more
forms
bobbed
to
the
surface
faces
down
rocking
gently
backs
slicked
wet
and
green
shiny
under
the
moonlight
but
those
were
the
ones
who
geo
began
are
they
dead
his
face
suddenly
hurt
a
little
with
something
like
the
pain
of
verging
tears
snake
nodded
are
you
sure
asked
iimmi
his
voice
came
slowly
thoughts
have
snake
said
crouched
down
in
front
of
them
urson
opened
his
great
hands
the
globes
blazed
even
in
the
dim
light
through
the
leaves
and
the
chain
and
the
wet
thong
hung
over
his
palm
to
the
ground
i
have
them
he
said
the
jewels
chapter
ix
snake
reached
down
picked
the
beads
up
from
urson
hand
the
sound
of
wings
had
stopped
where
do
we
go
now
urson
asked
follow
the
general
rule
i
guess
said
iimmi
since
we
know
hama
does
have
a
temple
somewhere
we
try
to
find
it
get
the
third
jewel
and
rescue
argo
incarnate
then
get
back
to
the
ship
in
three
days
asked
urson
they
had
related
the
rest
of
what
they
had
found
to
him
by
now
well
where
do
we
start
looking
the
priestess
said
something
about
a
band
of
hama
disciples
behind
the
fire
mountain
that
must
mean
the
volcano
we
saw
from
the
steps
in
the
city
of
new
hope
iimmi
turned
to
snake
did
you
read
her
mind
enough
to
know
if
she
was
telling
the
truth
snake
nodded
iimmi
paused
for
a
moment
well
since
the
river
is
that
way
we
should
head
he
turned
and
pointed
in
that
direction
they
fixed
their
stride
now
and
started
through
the
foliage
i
still
do
understand
what
was
going
on
back
at
the
monastery
geo
said
were
they
really
priestesses
of
argo
and
what
was
jordde
doing
i
say
yes
on
the
first
question
and
guess
that
jordde
was
a
spy
for
them
for
an
answer
to
the
second
but
what
about
argo
i
mean
argo
on
the
ship
asked
geo
and
what
about
snake
here
argo
on
the
ship
apparently
does
know
about
argo
on
aptor
said
iimmi
that
what
jordde
meant
when
he
reported
to
the
priestesses
that
she
was
bewildered
she
probably
thinks
just
like
we
did
that
he
hama
spy
and
this
one
here
he
gestured
to
snake
i
know
i
just
do
know
in
the
distance
was
a
red
glow
in
which
they
could
make
out
the
faint
lines
of
the
volcano
cone
snake
made
lights
with
the
jewels
and
once
more
they
began
to
pick
their
way
over
the
terrain
barer
and
barer
of
vegetation
the
earth
became
cindery
and
the
air
bore
the
acrid
smell
of
old
ashes
soon
the
rim
of
the
crater
hung
close
above
them
iimmi
gazed
up
at
the
red
haze
above
them
i
wonder
what
it
like
to
look
into
that
thing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
twenty
feet
later
snake
light
struck
a
lava
cliff
that
sheered
up
into
the
darkness
going
on
beside
it
they
found
a
ledge
that
made
an
footpath
diagonally
up
the
face
we
not
going
to
climb
that
in
the
dark
are
we
asked
geo
better
than
in
the
light
said
urson
this
way
you
ca
see
how
far
you
have
to
fall
thirty
feet
on
instead
of
petering
out
and
forcing
them
to
go
back
the
lip
of
rock
broadened
into
a
level
stretch
of
ground
and
again
they
could
go
straight
forward
toward
the
red
light
above
them
this
is
changeable
country
urson
muttered
men
change
into
animals
said
geo
jungles
turn
to
mountains
he
reached
around
and
felt
the
stub
of
his
arm
in
the
dark
i
changed
too
i
guess
iimmi
recited
is
neither
merciful
nor
just
they
say
leonard
of
vinci
put
his
trust
in
faulty
paints
christ
supper
turned
to
what
that
from
geo
asked
that
one
of
my
bits
of
original
research
iimmi
explained
it
comes
from
a
poem
dating
back
before
the
great
fire
who
was
leonard
of
vinci
geo
asked
an
artist
another
poet
or
painter
i
suppose
said
iimmi
but
not
really
sure
who
christ
urson
asked
another
god
there
were
more
rocks
now
and
geo
had
to
brace
his
stub
against
the
walls
of
fissures
and
hoist
himself
up
with
his
good
hand
the
igneous
structures
were
sharp
in
his
palm
through
the
night
the
glowing
rim
dropped
toward
them
with
it
came
a
breeze
that
pushed
sulfa
powder
through
their
hair
and
made
the
edges
of
their
nostrils
sting
the
earth
became
scaley
and
rotten
under
their
feet
fatigue
tied
tiny
knots
high
in
their
guts
so
that
their
stomachs
hung
like
stones
i
did
realize
how
big
the
crater
was
iimmi
said
the
red
glow
cut
off
at
the
bottom
and
took
up
a
quarter
of
the
sky
maybe
it
erupt
on
us
urson
muttered
he
added
i
thirsty
they
climbed
on
once
urson
looked
back
and
saw
geo
had
stopped
some
twenty
feet
behind
them
at
a
niche
in
the
ledge
he
turned
around
and
dropped
back
himself
there
was
sweat
on
the
boy
face
as
the
big
man
came
toward
him
he
could
see
it
in
the
red
haze
from
the
rim
here
urson
said
give
me
a
hand
i
ca
geo
said
softly
or
i
fall
urson
reached
down
now
caught
the
boy
around
the
chest
and
hoisted
him
over
the
cropping
of
rock
take
it
easy
urson
instructed
you
do
have
to
race
with
anybody
together
they
made
their
way
after
the
others
iimmi
and
snake
cleared
the
crater
rim
first
then
urson
and
geo
joined
them
on
the
pitted
ledge
together
they
looked
into
the
volcano
as
red
and
yellow
light
fell
over
their
chests
and
faces
gold
dribbled
the
internal
slope
tongues
of
red
rock
lapped
the
sides
and
the
swirling
white
basin
belched
brown
blobs
of
smoke
which
rose
up
the
far
rocks
and
spilled
over
the
brim
a
radion
away
light
leapt
in
wavering
pylons
of
blue
flame
then
sank
back
into
the
pit
winding
trails
of
light
webbed
the
crater
walls
and
at
places
ebon
cavities
jeweled
among
the
light
wind
fingered
the
watchers
hair
iimmi
saw
her
first
two
hundred
feet
along
the
rim
her
drapes
died
red
and
orange
in
the
flame
blew
about
her
as
she
walked
toward
them
iimmi
pointed
to
her
and
the
others
looked
up
as
she
neared
geo
saw
that
though
she
stood
very
straight
she
was
old
her
short
white
hair
snapped
at
the
side
of
her
head
in
the
warm
breeze
firelight
and
shadow
fell
deeply
into
the
wrinkles
of
her
face
as
she
approached
them
light
running
like
liquid
down
the
side
of
her
winded
robe
she
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
who
are
you
geo
suddenly
asked
melt
in
light
of
sacred
laughter
hands
and
houses
shall
be
one
recited
the
woman
in
a
calm
low
voice
she
paused
i
am
argo
incarnate
of
leptar
but
i
thought
iimmi
started
what
did
you
think
inquired
the
elderly
woman
gently
nothing
said
iimmi
he
thought
you
were
a
lot
younger
urson
said
we
supposed
to
take
you
home
suddenly
he
pointed
in
to
the
volcano
say
this
is
any
of
that
funny
light
like
back
in
the
city
that
burned
our
hands
only
this
time
it
made
you
old
she
glanced
at
the
pool
of
light
this
is
natural
fire
she
assured
them
a
severed
artery
of
the
earth
burning
blood
but
wounds
are
natural
enough
geo
shifted
his
feet
and
rubbed
his
stump
we
were
supposed
to
take
the
younger
sister
of
the
present
argo
incarnate
and
return
with
her
to
leptar
iimmi
explained
there
are
many
argos
smiled
the
woman
the
goddess
has
many
faces
you
have
seen
quite
a
few
since
you
arrived
in
this
land
i
guess
we
have
urson
said
are
you
a
prisoner
of
hama
asked
iimmi
i
am
with
hama
said
the
woman
we
are
supposed
to
secure
the
third
jewel
and
bring
it
back
to
the
ship
we
do
have
much
time
yes
said
argo
hey
what
about
that
nest
of
vampires
down
there
urson
said
thumbing
viciously
toward
the
black
behind
them
they
said
they
worshiped
argo
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
them
i
do
trust
anything
on
this
place
very
much
the
nature
of
the
goddess
is
change
said
the
woman
looking
sadly
toward
the
slope
from
birth
through
life
to
death
she
looked
back
up
at
them
to
birth
again
as
i
said
argo
has
many
faces
you
must
be
very
tired
yes
said
geo
then
come
with
me
please
she
turned
and
began
to
walk
back
along
the
rim
snake
and
iimmi
started
after
her
and
then
came
geo
and
urson
i
do
like
any
of
this
the
big
man
whispered
to
geo
as
they
came
along
argo
does
mean
the
same
thing
in
this
land
like
she
means
on
leptar
there
nothing
but
more
evil
to
come
out
of
this
she
leading
us
into
a
trap
i
tell
you
i
say
the
best
thing
to
do
is
take
the
jewels
we
have
turn
around
and
get
the
hell
out
of
here
i
tell
you
geo
urson
geo
said
huh
the
big
man
asked
urson
i
very
tired
they
walked
silently
for
a
few
steps
more
then
urson
heaved
up
a
half
disgusted
breath
and
put
his
arm
around
geo
shoulder
come
on
he
grunted
supporting
geo
against
his
own
great
form
as
they
progressed
along
the
rocky
ledge
following
the
new
argo
at
last
she
turned
down
a
trail
that
dropped
into
the
crater
walk
carefully
here
she
said
as
they
turned
into
the
huge
pit
something
is
not
right
urson
said
softly
it
a
trap
i
tell
you
how
does
that
thing
go
i
could
use
it
now
brother
bear
the
winter
sleep
fire
shall
not
harm
continued
geo
says
who
mumbled
urson
glancing
into
the
bowl
of
flame
geo
went
on
not
alarm
while
the
current
grows
amber
honey
flows
golden
salmon
like
i
once
said
before
mused
urson
in
a
in
here
came
the
voice
of
argo
they
turned
into
the
dark
mouth
of
one
of
the
caves
which
pocked
the
crater
inside
wall
no
she
said
to
snake
who
was
about
to
use
the
jewels
for
illumination
they
have
been
used
too
much
already
with
a
small
stick
taken
from
a
pocket
in
her
robe
she
struck
a
flame
against
the
rock
then
raised
it
to
an
ornate
branching
candelabra
that
hung
from
the
stone
ceiling
by
brass
chains
flame
leapt
from
cast
oil
cup
to
oil
cup
from
the
hand
of
a
demon
to
a
monkey
mouth
from
a
nymph
belly
to
the
horns
of
a
satyr
head
chemicals
in
the
cups
caused
each
flame
to
burn
a
different
color
green
red
blue
and
orange
white
light
filled
the
small
chapel
and
played
across
the
tops
of
the
benches
on
the
altar
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
room
were
two
statues
of
equal
height
a
man
sitting
and
a
woman
kneeling
iimmi
looked
at
the
altar
geo
and
urson
stared
at
the
candelabra
what
is
it
iimmi
asked
when
he
saw
where
their
eyes
were
fixed
there
one
of
those
things
in
argo
cabin
on
board
the
ship
geo
said
and
look
over
there
where
did
we
see
one
of
those
before
it
was
a
machine
with
an
opaque
glass
screen
identical
to
the
one
in
the
monastery
of
argo
sit
down
argo
said
sit
down
they
sank
to
the
benches
the
climb
once
halted
knotting
their
calves
and
the
low
muscles
on
their
backs
hama
has
allowed
you
the
privilege
of
a
chapel
even
in
captivity
commented
iimmi
but
i
see
you
have
to
share
your
altar
with
him
but
i
am
hama
mother
smiled
argo
geo
and
urson
frowned
the
rituals
say
that
argo
is
the
mother
of
all
things
the
begetter
and
bearer
of
all
life
i
am
the
mother
of
all
gods
as
well
those
blind
women
down
in
the
ground
asked
urson
they
are
really
your
priestesses
are
they
they
wanted
to
kill
us
i
bet
they
were
really
dupes
of
hama
it
is
so
simple
replied
argo
they
are
really
worshipers
of
argo
but
as
i
said
i
have
many
faces
death
as
well
as
life
is
my
province
the
dwellers
in
that
convent
from
which
you
escaped
are
a
how
shall
i
say
a
degenerate
branch
of
the
religion
they
were
truly
blinded
by
the
fall
of
the
city
of
new
hope
to
them
argo
is
only
death
the
dominator
of
men
for
not
only
is
argo
the
mother
of
hama
she
is
his
wife
and
daughter
then
it
like
we
figured
said
iimmi
jordde
is
a
spy
for
hama
he
working
for
the
renegade
priestesses
of
argo
yes
returned
argo
except
that
renegade
is
perhaps
the
wrong
word
they
believe
that
their
way
is
correct
and
a
respect
for
belief
is
essential
to
the
understanding
of
man
and
it
is
through
understanding
that
the
mysteries
that
still
remain
in
your
mind
will
be
solved
then
they
must
be
responsible
for
all
that
was
going
on
in
leptar
only
somehow
blaming
it
on
hama
said
iimmi
they
were
probably
just
after
the
jewels
too
you
do
look
like
a
prisoner
that
must
be
the
whole
thing
you
here
in
league
with
hama
to
prevent
the
priestesses
of
argo
from
taking
over
leptar
nothing
could
be
simpler
said
the
goddess
unfortunately
you
are
wrong
in
nearly
every
other
point
but
then
why
did
jordde
throw
the
jewel
after
us
when
he
tore
it
from
argo
i
mean
the
other
argo
throat
when
he
snatched
the
jewel
from
around
my
daughter
neck
added
argo
he
threw
it
to
the
creatures
of
the
sea
because
he
knew
they
would
take
it
back
to
aptor
with
it
once
again
in
the
island
the
priestesses
would
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
it
my
daughter
acting
argo
incarnate
in
my
absence
and
her
sister
does
not
know
that
what
she
is
fighting
is
another
face
of
argo
as
far
as
she
is
concerned
all
her
efforts
are
against
the
mischief
hama
has
caused
and
truly
caused
in
leptar
this
ignorance
is
far
greater
than
you
imagine
for
beyond
these
blind
creatures
is
a
far
greater
enemy
that
she
must
vanquish
hama
began
iimmi
greater
than
hama
said
old
argo
it
is
herself
it
is
hard
for
me
to
watch
her
and
not
occasionally
call
out
a
word
of
guidance
with
the
science
here
in
aptor
it
would
not
be
difficult
but
i
must
refrain
i
suppose
she
has
actually
done
well
but
there
is
so
much
more
to
do
she
has
directed
you
well
and
assigned
your
tasks
properly
and
until
now
you
have
carried
them
out
well
she
said
we
were
to
steal
the
final
jewel
from
hama
and
return
with
you
to
the
ship
said
geo
can
you
help
us
with
either
of
these
things
the
moment
i
compliment
you
laughed
argo
you
completely
confuse
your
mission
once
the
jewel
is
stolen
whom
are
you
supposed
to
take
back
to
leptar
argo
incarnate
urson
said
you
said
that
argo
back
in
the
ship
was
your
daughter
said
geo
but
she
said
you
were
her
younger
sister
she
said
nothing
of
the
sort
argo
corrected
i
have
two
daughters
you
have
already
met
one
now
you
must
rescue
the
other
when
my
youngest
daughter
was
kidnaped
here
to
aptor
i
was
already
here
waiting
for
her
look
she
turned
a
dial
beneath
the
screen
and
lights
flickered
over
the
glass
until
they
formed
a
sleeping
figure
she
had
short
red
hair
a
splash
of
freckles
over
a
blunt
nose
and
her
hand
lay
curled
in
a
loose
fist
near
her
mouth
a
white
sheet
covered
the
gentle
push
of
adolescent
breasts
and
on
the
table
beside
her
bed
was
a
contraption
made
of
a
piece
of
metal
mounted
on
a
board
an
incomplete
coil
of
wire
and
a
few
more
bits
of
metal
all
sitting
on
top
of
a
crumpled
paper
bag
that
is
my
youngest
daughter
argo
said
switching
off
the
picture
she
is
the
one
you
must
take
back
to
the
ship
how
shall
we
steal
the
jewel
asked
geo
argo
turned
to
snake
i
believe
that
was
your
task
then
she
looked
around
at
the
other
three
you
will
need
rest
after
that
you
can
see
about
the
jewel
and
my
daughter
come
with
me
now
pallets
have
been
set
up
for
you
in
the
far
room
where
you
may
sleep
she
rose
and
led
them
to
a
further
chamber
the
blankets
over
the
loose
boughs
seemed
to
pull
them
down
argo
pointed
to
a
trickle
of
water
that
ran
from
a
basin
carved
in
the
rock
wall
this
stream
is
pure
you
may
drink
from
it
she
pointed
to
a
cloth
sack
in
the
corner
there
is
fruit
in
there
if
you
become
hungry
sleep
said
urson
jammed
his
two
fists
in
the
air
and
yawned
as
they
settled
argo
said
poet
yes
answered
geo
i
know
you
are
the
tiredest
but
i
must
talk
to
you
alone
for
a
moment
or
two
as
geo
raised
himself
urson
stood
up
too
look
he
said
to
argo
he
needs
the
rest
more
than
any
of
us
if
you
want
to
question
him
about
rituals
and
spells
take
iimmi
he
knows
just
as
much
as
geo
i
need
a
poet
smiled
argo
not
a
student
i
need
one
who
has
suffered
as
he
has
come
wait
urson
said
he
picked
the
jewel
from
geo
chest
where
snake
had
returned
it
when
they
entered
the
chapel
you
better
leave
this
with
me
geo
frowned
it
still
may
be
a
trap
said
urson
leave
it
with
him
suggested
argo
if
it
eases
him
geo
let
the
great
hand
lift
the
thong
from
his
neck
now
come
with
me
said
argo
they
left
the
room
and
walked
back
through
the
chapel
to
the
door
argo
stood
in
the
entrance
looking
down
at
the
molten
rock
the
light
sifted
through
her
robe
leaving
the
darker
outline
of
her
body
without
turning
she
began
to
speak
the
fire
is
a
splendid
symbol
for
life
do
you
agree
and
for
death
said
geo
one
of
aptor
fires
burned
my
arm
away
yes
she
turned
now
you
and
snake
have
had
the
hardest
time
both
of
you
have
left
your
flesh
to
rot
in
aptor
i
guess
that
gives
you
a
closeness
to
the
land
she
paused
you
know
he
had
a
great
deal
more
pain
than
you
do
you
know
how
he
lost
his
tongue
i
watched
it
all
from
this
same
screen
inside
the
chapel
and
could
not
help
they
jammed
their
knuckles
in
his
jaws
and
when
the
mouth
came
open
jordde
caught
the
red
flesh
with
pincers
that
closed
all
the
way
through
and
stretched
it
out
as
far
as
it
would
go
then
he
looped
the
tongue
with
a
thin
wire
and
then
he
threw
a
switch
you
do
not
know
what
electricity
is
do
you
i
have
heard
the
word
let
me
just
say
that
when
a
great
deal
of
it
is
passed
through
a
thin
wire
the
wire
becomes
very
hot
white
hot
and
the
white
hot
loop
was
tautened
until
the
rope
of
muscle
seared
away
and
just
the
roasted
stump
was
left
but
the
child
had
fainted
already
i
wonder
if
the
young
can
really
bear
more
pain
than
older
people
jordde
and
the
blind
priestess
did
that
to
him
jordde
and
some
men
on
the
boat
that
picked
up
the
two
of
them
from
the
raft
on
which
they
had
left
aptor
who
is
jordde
geo
asked
urson
knew
him
before
this
as
a
first
mate
but
urson
story
told
me
nothing
i
know
the
story
argo
said
and
it
tells
you
something
but
something
you
would
perhaps
rather
not
know
she
sighed
poet
how
well
do
you
know
yourself
what
do
you
mean
geo
asked
how
well
do
you
know
the
workings
of
a
man
how
he
manages
to
function
that
is
what
you
will
sing
of
if
your
songs
are
to
become
great
i
still
do
i
have
a
question
for
you
a
poetic
riddle
will
you
try
to
answer
it
if
you
will
answer
a
not
too
poetic
riddle
for
me
will
you
do
your
best
to
answer
mine
argo
asked
yes
then
i
will
do
my
best
to
answer
yours
what
is
your
question
who
is
jordde
and
why
is
he
doing
what
he
doing
he
was
at
one
time
argo
explained
a
very
promising
novice
for
the
priesthood
of
argo
in
leptar
as
well
as
a
scholar
of
myths
and
rituals
like
iimmi
and
yourself
he
also
took
to
the
sea
to
learn
of
the
world
but
his
boat
was
wrecked
and
he
and
a
few
others
were
cast
on
shore
they
strove
with
aptor
terrors
as
you
did
and
many
succumbed
two
however
a
cabin
boy
whom
you
call
snake
and
jordde
were
each
exposed
to
the
forces
of
argo
and
hama
as
you
have
been
one
in
his
strangeness
could
see
into
men
minds
the
other
could
not
silently
one
swore
allegiance
to
one
force
while
one
swore
allegiance
to
the
other
the
second
part
of
your
question
was
perhaps
if
you
can
answer
my
riddle
you
can
answer
that
part
yourself
i
do
know
that
they
were
the
only
two
who
escaped
i
do
know
that
snake
would
not
tell
jordde
his
choice
and
that
jordde
tried
to
convince
the
child
to
follow
him
when
they
were
rescued
i
know
that
the
argument
continued
and
that
snake
held
back
with
childish
tenacity
both
his
decision
and
his
ability
to
read
minds
even
under
the
hot
wire
and
the
pincers
the
hot
wire
incidentally
was
something
jordde
brought
with
him
from
the
blind
priestesses
according
to
him
to
help
the
people
of
leptar
with
it
could
have
been
a
great
use
but
recently
all
he
has
done
with
the
electricity
is
construct
a
larger
weapon
with
it
however
jordde
became
a
staunch
first
mate
in
a
year
time
snake
became
a
waterfront
thief
both
waited
then
when
the
opportunity
arose
both
acted
why
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
poet
thank
you
for
telling
me
what
you
know
geo
said
what
is
your
question
she
glanced
at
the
flame
through
the
door
once
more
and
then
recited
the
dark
chamber
sits
its
twin
where
the
body
floods
begin
and
the
two
are
twinned
again
turning
out
and
turning
the
bright
chamber
runs
the
line
of
the
division
silver
fine
diminishing
along
the
lanes
of
memory
to
an
inward
floods
in
the
turning
room
love
breaks
in
the
burning
it
is
not
one
that
i
have
heard
before
geo
said
i
not
even
sure
i
know
what
the
question
is
i
familiar
with
neither
its
diction
nor
style
i
doubted
very
much
that
you
would
recognize
it
smiled
argo
is
it
part
of
the
rituals
of
argo
it
was
written
by
my
youngest
daughter
argo
said
the
question
is
can
you
explain
it
oh
said
geo
i
did
realize
he
paused
by
the
dark
chamber
sits
its
twin
moving
in
and
out
and
that
where
the
floods
of
the
body
begin
and
it
twinned
again
the
heart
he
suggested
the
human
heart
that
where
the
body
flood
begins
i
think
that
will
do
for
part
of
the
answer
the
bright
chamber
mused
geo
the
burning
dome
the
human
mind
i
guess
the
line
of
division
running
down
the
lane
of
memory
i
not
sure
you
seem
to
be
doing
fairly
well
could
it
refer
to
something
like
two
sides
of
every
question
geo
asked
or
something
similar
it
could
argo
said
though
i
must
confess
i
had
thought
of
it
in
that
way
but
it
is
the
last
two
lines
that
puzzle
me
floods
in
the
turning
repeated
geo
breaks
in
the
burning
i
guess
that
the
mind
and
the
heart
again
you
usually
think
of
love
with
the
heart
and
fear
with
the
mind
maybe
she
meant
that
they
both
the
heart
and
the
mind
have
control
over
both
love
and
fear
perhaps
she
did
argo
smiled
you
must
ask
her
when
you
rescue
her
from
the
clutches
of
hama
before
turning
back
to
the
room
with
his
companions
he
looked
once
more
out
at
the
fires
of
the
volcano
light
whirled
white
and
red
blue
tongues
licked
at
black
rock
siding
he
turned
away
now
and
went
back
into
the
darkness
chapter
x
dawn
light
lay
the
crater
ridge
argo
pointed
down
the
opposite
slope
a
black
temple
was
visible
at
the
bottom
among
trees
and
lawns
there
is
hama
temple
argo
said
you
have
your
task
good
luck
they
started
down
the
incline
of
cinders
it
took
them
an
hour
to
reach
the
first
trees
that
surrounded
the
dark
buildings
and
the
great
gardens
entering
on
the
first
lip
of
grass
they
heard
a
sudden
cluster
of
notes
from
one
of
the
trees
a
bird
iimmi
said
i
have
heard
one
of
those
since
i
left
leptar
suddenly
bright
blue
and
the
length
of
a
man
forefinger
a
lizard
ran
halfway
down
the
trunk
of
the
tree
it
sapphire
belly
heaved
in
the
early
light
with
indrawn
breath
then
it
opened
its
red
mouth
its
throat
warbled
and
there
was
another
burst
of
music
oh
well
said
iimmi
i
was
close
they
walked
further
until
iimmi
mused
i
wonder
why
you
always
think
things
are
going
to
turn
out
like
you
expect
because
when
something
sounds
like
that
declared
urson
it
usually
is
a
bird
suddenly
he
gave
a
little
shiver
lizards
he
said
it
was
a
pretty
lizard
said
iimmi
going
around
expecting
things
to
be
what
they
seem
can
get
you
in
trouble
especially
on
this
island
geo
commented
the
angle
at
which
they
walked
made
one
of
the
clumps
of
tree
before
them
seem
to
fall
apart
a
man
standing
in
the
center
raised
his
hand
and
said
briskly
stop
they
stopped
he
wore
dark
robes
and
his
short
white
hair
made
a
close
helmet
above
his
brown
face
urson
hand
was
on
his
sword
snake
stood
with
his
feet
wide
his
hands
out
from
his
sides
who
are
you
the
dark
man
declared
who
are
you
urson
parried
i
am
hama
incarnate
they
were
silent
finally
geo
said
we
are
travelers
in
aptor
we
mean
any
harm
as
the
man
moved
forward
splotches
of
light
from
the
trees
slipped
across
his
robe
come
with
me
hama
said
he
turned
and
proceeded
among
the
trees
they
followed
they
passed
into
the
temple
garden
it
was
early
enough
in
the
morning
so
that
the
sunlight
lapped
pink
tongues
over
the
giant
black
urns
that
sat
along
the
edges
of
the
path
now
they
passed
into
the
temple
as
they
passed
hama
turned
looked
at
the
jewels
on
iimmi
and
necks
and
then
looked
up
at
the
gazing
eye
of
the
statue
at
the
end
of
the
altar
he
made
no
other
sign
but
turned
again
and
continued
the
morning
rites
have
not
yet
started
he
said
they
will
begin
in
a
half
an
hour
by
then
i
hope
to
have
divined
your
purpose
in
coming
here
at
the
other
side
of
the
stairway
they
mounted
a
stairway
and
then
entered
a
door
above
which
was
a
black
circle
dotted
with
three
eyes
just
as
they
were
about
to
go
in
geo
looked
around
frowned
and
caught
iimmi
eye
snake
he
mouthed
iimmi
looked
around
and
shrugged
the
man
turned
and
faced
them
apparently
unaware
of
snake
departure
as
he
closed
the
door
now
he
said
you
have
come
to
oppose
the
forces
of
aptor
am
i
right
you
come
to
steal
the
jewel
of
hama
you
have
come
to
kidnap
the
incarnate
argo
is
that
not
your
purpose
keep
your
hand
off
your
sword
urson
i
can
kill
you
in
a
moment
you
are
defenseless
damn
i
sleepy
she
rolled
over
and
cuddled
the
pillow
then
she
opened
her
eyes
one
at
a
time
and
lay
watching
the
nearly
completed
motor
of
metal
bars
and
copper
wire
that
sat
on
the
table
beside
her
bed
she
stood
up
then
she
collapsed
on
the
bed
and
jammed
her
feet
under
the
covers
again
with
thirty
feet
of
one
and
a
half
inch
brass
pipe
she
mused
sleepily
i
could
carry
heat
from
the
main
line
under
the
floor
which
i
would
estimate
to
be
about
the
proper
surface
area
to
keep
these
stones
warm
let
me
see
thirty
feet
of
one
and
a
half
inch
pipe
have
a
surface
area
of
times
times
which
is
divided
by
which
is
then
she
caught
herself
damn
you
thinking
this
to
avoid
thinking
about
getting
up
she
opened
her
eyes
once
more
put
feet
on
the
stone
and
held
them
there
while
she
scratched
vigorously
at
her
uneven
mop
of
red
hair
she
looked
at
the
clock
yikes
she
said
softly
and
ran
out
the
door
and
slammed
it
behind
her
almost
she
whirled
around
caught
it
on
her
palms
before
it
banged
shut
and
then
closed
it
with
gingerly
care
the
final
centimeter
and
a
half
of
the
arc
are
you
trying
to
get
caught
she
asked
herself
as
she
tiptoed
to
the
next
door
she
opened
it
and
looked
in
dunderhead
looks
cute
when
he
asleep
she
thought
there
was
a
cord
on
the
floor
that
ran
from
under
the
table
by
the
priest
bed
over
the
stones
carefully
following
the
zigzag
of
the
crevices
between
them
and
at
last
the
end
lay
in
the
corner
of
the
door
sill
you
really
could
see
it
if
you
were
looking
for
it
which
had
more
or
less
been
the
idea
when
she
had
put
it
there
last
night
before
the
priests
had
come
back
from
vespers
the
far
end
was
tied
in
a
knot
of
her
own
invention
to
the
electric
plug
of
his
alarm
clock
dunderhead
had
an
annoying
habit
of
his
clock
every
evening
making
sure
that
the
red
second
hand
was
still
sweeping
away
the
minutes
in
her
plans
for
this
morning
she
had
catalogued
his
every
habitual
action
and
had
observed
this
one
for
three
nights
running
hanging
upside
down
from
the
bulky
stone
portcullis
above
and
outside
his
window
tugging
on
the
string
she
saw
it
leap
from
the
crevices
into
a
straight
line
and
then
lift
from
the
floor
as
she
drew
it
tauter
and
then
go
slack
as
the
plug
blipped
quietly
onto
the
floor
next
she
pulled
the
string
again
until
the
slack
left
and
raised
her
end
a
few
inches
from
the
floor
with
her
free
hand
now
she
gave
the
string
a
small
twit
and
watched
the
vibration
run
up
and
down
the
string
twice
the
knot
invention
was
an
ingenuous
one
at
the
vibration
two
opposed
loops
shook
away
from
a
third
and
a
four
millimeter
length
of
rubber
band
that
had
been
sewn
in
tautened
and
released
a
fourth
loop
from
around
a
small
length
of
number
four
gauge
wire
with
a
holding
tonsure
of
three
quarters
of
a
gram
and
the
opposing
vibration
returning
up
the
thread
loosed
a
similar
apparatus
on
the
other
side
of
the
plug
the
knot
fell
away
and
she
wound
it
quickly
around
her
hand
she
stood
up
closed
the
door
and
the
oiled
lock
was
perfectly
silent
the
door
knob
was
just
the
slightest
bit
greasy
she
noted
careless
back
in
her
room
it
was
standing
on
the
table
sunlight
from
the
high
window
fell
red
across
the
board
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
she
took
the
parts
of
the
motor
up
in
her
hands
i
guess
we
try
you
out
today
no
she
answered
herself
yes
finally
she
put
the
parts
in
the
paper
bag
strode
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
whirled
around
and
caught
it
once
more
gnnnnnnn
she
said
do
you
want
to
get
caught
for
the
second
time
she
answered
herself
yes
and
remember
that
too
or
you
never
get
through
it
as
she
walked
down
the
hall
she
heard
through
one
of
the
windows
the
chirp
of
a
blue
lizard
from
the
garden
the
sound
i
wanted
to
hear
she
smiled
to
herself
a
good
sign
turning
into
the
temple
she
started
down
the
side
aisle
the
great
black
columns
passed
before
her
something
moved
between
the
columns
along
the
other
side
swift
and
indistinct
as
a
bird
shadow
at
least
she
thought
she
saw
something
remember
she
reminded
herself
you
have
guilt
feelings
about
this
whole
thing
and
you
could
very
easily
be
manufacturing
delusions
to
scare
yourself
out
of
going
through
with
it
she
went
on
passed
two
more
columns
and
saw
it
again
or
she
went
on
with
her
monologue
you
could
be
purposefully
ignoring
the
very
obvious
fact
that
there
is
somebody
over
there
who
is
going
to
see
you
so
watch
it
there
were
mirrors
somewhere
in
the
temple
but
they
were
on
the
opposite
wall
so
she
could
be
seeing
herself
in
fact
the
mirrors
were
out
in
the
vestibule
through
which
she
had
come
and
maybe
this
other
person
had
come
so
maybe
it
was
seeing
her
as
a
reflection
of
unscramble
that
syntax
she
told
herself
you
think
like
that
and
you
never
make
it
but
there
was
somebody
with
no
clothes
on
for
all
practical
purposes
sneaking
between
the
pillars
and
he
had
four
arms
that
made
her
start
to
think
of
something
else
but
the
thought
as
it
arrowed
into
the
past
suddenly
got
deflected
turned
completely
about
and
jammed
into
her
brain
again
because
he
was
staring
directly
at
her
he
starts
walking
toward
she
thought
going
to
be
scared
out
of
my
ears
so
i
better
start
walking
toward
him
besides
i
want
to
see
what
he
looks
she
started
out
from
the
columns
glancing
quickly
both
ways
she
saw
that
the
temple
was
deserted
save
for
them
a
she
thought
three
quarters
of
the
way
across
she
added
and
again
a
foreign
thought
attempted
to
intrude
itself
on
her
but
never
made
it
because
he
was
coming
toward
her
now
at
last
he
stopped
before
her
silent
muscles
like
tight
wire
under
the
brown
skin
black
hair
massing
low
on
his
forehead
his
eyes
deep
beneath
the
black
shrub
of
brows
she
gulped
and
asked
him
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
know
somebody
could
catch
you
in
here
and
get
mad
as
hell
i
know
i
could
possibly
have
but
i
think
i
seen
you
before
some
place
if
somebody
comes
along
they
might
even
think
you
were
trying
to
steal
hama
eye
should
have
said
she
thought
he
moved
you
better
get
out
of
here
because
everybody
will
be
up
here
in
a
half
an
hour
for
morning
services
at
that
news
he
suddenly
darted
forward
passed
her
and
sprinted
down
toward
the
altar
hey
she
called
and
ran
after
him
snake
vaulted
over
the
brass
altar
rail
wait
a
minute
she
called
catching
up
wait
will
you
snake
turned
as
she
slung
her
leg
across
the
brass
bar
look
i
realize
i
gave
away
my
hand
but
that
was
only
guilt
feelings
you
gave
yours
away
too
though
and
if
you
do
think
you
got
guilt
feelings
boy
you
crazy
snake
frowned
tilted
his
head
and
then
grinned
so
we
help
each
other
see
she
said
you
want
it
too
do
you
she
pointed
up
to
the
head
of
the
statue
towering
above
them
so
i
get
it
for
a
little
while
then
you
can
have
it
he
was
listening
she
saw
so
she
guessed
her
strategy
was
working
it
by
ear
she
thought
we
help
each
other
shake
on
it
huh
she
stuck
out
her
hand
all
four
hands
reached
forward
she
thought
hope
he
not
but
the
four
hands
grasped
hers
and
she
added
her
second
to
the
juncture
all
right
she
said
come
on
now
i
had
all
this
figured
out
last
night
and
we
do
have
much
time
let
go
around
but
he
walked
over
to
where
the
stalks
of
wheat
spired
from
the
altar
base
up
through
hama
fist
and
grabbed
a
stalk
with
the
three
hands
and
hand
over
hand
over
hand
began
to
hoist
himself
up
to
where
the
first
broad
sheets
of
metal
leaves
leaned
out
to
form
a
small
platform
at
first
his
dirty
feet
swung
out
but
then
he
caught
the
stem
with
his
toes
and
at
last
hoisted
himself
to
the
front
and
looked
down
at
her
i
ca
climb
up
there
she
said
i
do
have
your
elevation
power
snake
looked
down
and
shrugged
oh
damn
she
said
i
do
it
my
way
she
ran
across
the
altar
to
the
great
foot
of
the
statue
sitting
hama
foot
was
on
his
side
using
the
ridges
made
by
the
toes
as
steps
she
clammered
up
to
the
dark
bulge
of
the
deity
godlike
bunion
she
made
her
way
across
the
ankle
up
the
slanting
shin
back
down
the
black
thigh
until
she
stood
at
the
crevice
where
the
leg
and
torso
met
out
beyond
the
great
knee
snake
regarded
her
from
his
perch
in
the
groin
of
yellow
leaf
they
were
about
equal
height
she
waved
meet
you
at
the
clavicle
then
she
stuck
her
tongue
out
the
bulges
in
the
belly
of
the
god
made
a
treacherous
ledge
along
which
she
inched
until
she
arrived
at
the
cavernous
naval
leaving
wet
handprints
on
the
black
stone
the
god
belly
button
from
this
intimate
distance
revealed
itself
as
a
circular
door
about
five
feet
in
diameter
and
controlled
by
a
combination
lock
she
missed
the
first
number
twice
dried
her
hands
off
and
began
again
according
to
the
plans
in
the
main
safe
of
the
temple
on
which
she
had
first
practiced
combination
breaking
there
was
a
ladder
behind
this
door
which
led
up
into
the
statue
she
remembered
it
clearly
and
saved
her
life
by
doing
so
because
when
she
caught
the
second
number
reversed
the
direction
and
felt
the
telltale
click
of
the
third
she
pulled
on
the
handle
and
was
almost
pushed
from
the
ledge
by
the
swinging
circular
door
she
grabbed
at
a
handle
that
she
hardly
saw
on
the
door
inside
just
as
the
stone
slipped
from
beneath
her
feet
then
she
was
hanging
five
feet
out
in
the
air
over
the
sacred
groin
some
fifty
feet
below
the
first
thing
she
tried
after
closing
her
eyes
and
mumbling
a
few
laws
of
motion
was
to
swing
the
door
to
when
she
swung
out
however
the
door
swung
closed
and
when
she
swung
in
the
door
swung
opened
after
a
while
she
just
hung
she
gave
small
thanks
that
she
had
dried
her
hands
when
her
arms
began
to
ache
she
wished
that
she
had
because
then
it
would
be
over
by
now
she
went
over
what
she
knew
about
taking
judo
falls
then
the
door
swung
closed
and
someone
grabbed
her
around
the
waist
she
did
open
her
eyes
but
felt
her
body
pressed
against
the
tilting
stone
her
arms
fell
tingling
to
her
sides
the
ligaments
flamed
with
pain
then
the
pain
dulled
to
throbbing
and
she
opened
her
eyes
how
the
hell
did
you
get
down
here
she
asked
snake
with
his
help
she
staggered
through
the
open
door
and
stopped
to
rub
her
arms
how
did
you
know
about
the
ladder
they
were
standing
in
the
shaft
now
with
the
ladder
beside
them
running
up
into
the
darkness
he
looked
at
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
what
is
it
she
asked
oh
i
be
able
to
climb
up
there
never
you
worry
hey
can
you
speak
snake
shook
his
head
oh
she
said
something
started
at
the
edge
of
her
mind
again
a
picture
of
something
unpleasant
snake
had
started
up
the
ladder
which
he
had
come
down
so
quickly
a
minute
ago
she
glanced
out
the
door
saw
that
the
temple
was
empty
pulled
the
door
to
and
followed
they
ascended
into
complete
darkness
her
arms
were
beginning
to
ache
again
just
slightly
she
reached
up
for
the
next
rung
and
found
it
in
its
proper
place
then
the
next
and
then
again
the
next
she
started
counting
steps
now
and
when
and
dropped
below
her
there
was
a
missing
rung
she
reached
above
it
but
there
was
none
she
ran
her
hand
up
the
edge
of
the
ladder
and
found
that
it
suddenly
curved
into
the
wall
hey
you
she
said
in
the
darkness
something
touched
her
waist
gnnnnnggggg
she
said
do
that
it
touched
her
on
the
leg
took
hold
of
her
ankle
and
pulled
watch
out
she
said
it
pulled
again
she
raised
her
foot
and
it
was
tugged
sideways
a
good
foot
and
a
half
and
set
on
solid
flooring
then
a
hand
her
foot
was
not
released
took
her
arm
and
another
held
her
waist
and
tugged
she
stiffened
for
one
instant
before
she
remembered
the
number
of
limbs
her
companion
had
then
she
came
off
the
ladder
sideways
into
the
dark
afraid
to
put
her
other
foot
down
lest
she
step
headlong
into
the
foot
plus
shaft
but
he
tugged
again
and
in
losing
her
balance
her
foot
came
down
on
cool
solid
stone
holding
her
arm
now
he
led
her
along
the
tunnel
they
passed
into
a
steep
incline
now
down
the
upper
arm
she
recalled
i
feel
like
eurydice
she
said
aloud
funny
an
echoing
voice
sounded
in
her
skull
hey
she
said
what
was
that
but
the
voice
was
silent
the
wall
turned
abruptly
and
the
floor
leveled
out
they
were
in
a
section
of
the
passage
now
that
corresponded
roughly
to
the
statue
radial
artery
at
the
wrist
there
was
a
light
they
mounted
a
stairway
came
out
a
trap
door
and
found
themselves
standing
high
in
the
temple
below
them
the
great
room
spread
vastly
deep
and
still
empty
beside
them
the
stems
of
the
bronze
wheat
stalks
rose
up
through
the
fist
and
spired
another
fifty
feet
before
breaking
into
clusters
of
golden
grain
and
leaves
across
from
them
over
the
dark
curve
of
gargantuan
chest
in
the
statue
other
hand
the
shaft
of
the
scythe
leaned
away
into
shadow
look
she
said
you
follow
me
now
she
started
back
along
the
top
of
the
forearm
and
then
began
the
tedious
climb
over
the
rippling
biceps
till
at
last
they
reached
the
broad
shoulder
they
walked
across
the
hollow
above
the
collar
bone
until
they
stood
just
below
the
great
scooping
shell
of
the
ear
she
took
the
paper
bag
she
had
stuffed
into
her
belt
tied
one
end
of
the
string
around
the
neck
and
then
holding
the
other
she
heaved
the
bag
up
and
over
the
ear
she
got
the
other
end
of
the
string
knotted
it
as
high
as
she
could
reach
and
gave
it
a
tug
i
hope
this
works
she
said
i
had
it
all
figured
out
yesterday
the
tensile
strength
of
this
stuff
is
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
ought
to
do
for
you
and
me
she
planted
her
foot
on
the
swell
of
the
neck
tendon
and
in
seven
leaps
she
made
it
to
the
lobe
of
the
ear
she
swung
around
into
the
hollow
using
the
frontal
wing
as
a
pivot
crouching
in
the
hollow
trumpet
she
looked
down
at
snake
come
up
she
said
hurry
up
snake
joined
her
a
moment
later
the
ear
was
hollow
too
it
led
back
into
a
cylindrical
chamber
which
went
up
through
the
head
of
the
god
the
architect
who
had
designed
the
statue
had
conveniently
left
the
god
lid
flipped
they
climbed
the
ladder
and
emerged
amid
the
tangle
of
pipes
which
represented
the
hair
of
the
god
they
made
their
way
forward
through
the
mass
of
pipes
to
where
the
forehead
sloped
dangerously
forward
they
could
see
the
foreshortened
nose
and
the
rim
of
the
statue
middle
eye
above
that
there
was
much
of
anything
after
that
for
the
next
thousand
feet
until
the
base
of
the
altar
now
you
can
really
be
some
help
she
told
him
hold
on
to
my
wrist
and
let
me
down
i
get
the
jewel
they
grabbed
wrists
and
snake
three
other
hands
as
well
as
the
joints
of
his
knees
locked
around
the
base
of
five
pipes
that
sprouted
around
them
slowly
she
slid
forward
until
her
free
hand
slipped
on
the
stone
and
she
dropped
the
length
of
their
two
arms
and
swung
just
above
the
statue
nose
the
eye
opened
in
front
of
her
the
lid
arced
above
her
and
the
white
of
either
side
of
the
ebony
iris
shone
faintly
in
the
half
darkness
at
the
center
of
the
iris
in
a
small
hollow
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
metal
support
was
the
jewel
she
reached
her
free
hand
toward
it
as
she
swung
from
somewhere
a
gong
suddenly
sounded
light
flooded
over
her
looking
up
she
saw
white
sockets
of
light
shining
down
into
her
own
eyes
panicking
she
almost
released
snake
wrist
but
a
voice
in
her
head
hers
or
someone
else
she
could
tell
rang
out
on
damn
it
then
she
grabbed
the
jewel
the
metal
shaft
in
which
the
jewel
had
stood
was
not
steady
and
tilted
as
her
hand
came
away
from
it
the
tilting
must
have
set
off
some
clockwork
mechanism
because
the
great
eyelid
was
slowly
lowering
over
the
ivory
and
ebony
eye
she
swung
again
at
the
end
of
the
rope
of
bone
and
flesh
half
blinded
by
the
lights
above
her
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
into
the
temple
below
there
was
singing
the
beginning
of
a
processional
hymn
the
morning
rites
had
started
light
glinted
on
the
stone
limbs
of
the
god
figures
were
pouring
into
the
temple
they
must
have
seen
her
but
the
hymn
sonorous
and
gigantic
rose
like
flood
water
and
she
suddenly
thought
that
if
she
fell
she
would
drown
in
the
sound
of
it
snake
was
pulling
her
up
stone
against
her
arm
against
her
cheek
she
clenched
her
other
fist
tightly
at
her
side
another
hand
came
down
and
helped
pull
her
then
another
then
she
was
lying
among
the
metal
pipes
and
he
was
loosening
her
fingers
from
his
wrist
he
tugged
her
to
her
feet
and
for
a
moment
she
was
looking
out
over
the
now
filled
temple
nervous
energy
contracted
coldly
along
her
body
and
the
sudden
sight
of
the
great
drop
filled
her
eyes
and
her
head
and
she
staggered
snake
caught
her
and
at
last
helped
her
back
to
the
ladder
we
got
it
she
said
to
him
before
they
started
down
she
breathed
deeply
then
she
checked
in
her
palm
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
it
was
and
again
she
looked
out
over
the
people
below
light
on
the
faces
made
them
look
like
scattered
pearls
on
the
dark
floor
an
exaltation
suddenly
burst
in
her
shoulders
flooded
her
legs
and
arms
and
for
a
moment
washed
the
pain
away
snake
with
one
hand
on
her
shoulder
was
grinning
also
we
got
it
she
said
again
they
went
down
the
ladder
into
the
statue
skull
snake
preceded
her
out
the
hollow
ear
he
reached
around
caught
the
cord
and
let
himself
down
to
the
shoulder
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
put
the
jewel
in
her
mouth
and
followed
him
standing
beside
him
once
more
she
removed
it
and
then
rubbed
her
shoulders
boy
am
i
going
to
have
some
charley
horse
by
tomorrow
she
said
do
me
a
favor
and
untie
my
bag
for
me
snake
untied
the
parcel
from
the
end
of
the
cord
and
together
now
they
climbed
down
the
bicep
and
back
over
the
forearm
to
the
trap
door
in
the
wrist
she
glanced
down
at
the
faces
of
the
worshipers
just
before
they
disappeared
into
the
tunnel
snake
was
taking
the
jewel
from
her
hand
she
let
him
have
it
and
watched
him
raise
it
up
above
his
head
immediately
when
he
raised
the
jewel
the
pearls
of
faces
went
out
like
extinguished
flames
as
heads
bent
all
through
the
temple
that
the
ticket
grinned
argo
come
on
but
snake
did
not
go
into
the
tunnel
instead
he
walked
around
the
fist
took
hold
of
one
of
the
bronze
wheat
stems
and
slid
down
through
an
opening
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
that
way
asked
argo
oh
well
i
guess
so
you
know
i
going
to
write
an
epic
about
this
but
snake
had
already
gone
she
followed
him
clutching
her
feet
around
a
great
bunch
of
stems
he
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
plateau
of
leaves
and
nestled
there
they
gazed
out
once
more
at
the
fascinated
congregation
again
snake
held
aloft
the
jewel
and
again
heads
bowed
the
hymn
began
to
repeat
itself
the
individual
words
lost
in
the
sonority
of
the
hall
they
started
down
the
last
length
of
stems
now
coming
quickly
when
they
stood
at
last
on
the
base
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
across
the
brass
altar
rail
the
congregation
pressed
close
although
she
did
not
recognize
an
individual
face
yet
a
mass
of
people
stood
there
enormous
and
familiar
as
snake
started
forward
holding
up
the
jewel
the
people
fell
back
from
the
rail
snake
climbed
over
the
altar
rail
and
then
helped
her
over
her
shoulders
were
beginning
to
hurt
now
and
the
enormity
of
the
theft
ran
chills
up
and
down
up
and
down
her
spine
the
black
marble
altar
step
as
she
put
her
foot
down
was
awfully
cold
they
started
forward
again
and
the
last
note
of
the
hymn
echoed
to
silence
filling
the
hall
with
the
roaring
quiet
of
the
hushed
breathing
of
hundreds
simultaneously
both
she
and
snake
got
the
urge
to
look
back
at
the
great
diminishing
height
of
hama
behind
them
all
three
eyes
were
shut
firmly
now
a
quiet
composed
of
the
rustling
of
a
hundred
dark
robes
upon
another
hundred
hissed
about
them
as
they
started
forward
again
there
was
a
spotlight
on
them
she
suddenly
realized
that
was
why
the
people
hovering
back
from
the
circular
effulgence
over
the
floor
around
them
seemed
so
dim
her
heart
had
become
a
pulse
at
the
bottom
of
her
tongue
they
kept
on
going
forward
into
the
shadowed
faces
into
the
parting
sea
of
dark
cloaks
and
hoods
then
the
last
of
the
figures
stepped
aside
from
the
temple
door
and
she
could
see
the
sunlight
out
in
the
garden
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
snake
holding
high
the
jewel
then
they
burst
forward
out
through
the
door
and
down
over
the
bright
steps
instantly
the
hymn
began
again
behind
them
as
if
their
departure
had
been
a
signal
the
music
flooded
after
them
and
when
they
reached
the
bottom
step
they
both
whirled
crouching
like
animals
expecting
the
congregation
to
come
welling
darkly
out
after
them
but
there
was
only
the
music
flowing
into
the
light
washing
around
them
a
transparent
river
a
sea
the
drop
in
the
hand
and
break
the
earth
with
singing
hail
the
height
of
a
man
and
also
the
height
of
a
over
the
music
came
a
brittle
chirping
from
the
trees
fixed
with
fear
they
watched
the
temple
door
as
the
hymn
progressed
then
snake
suddenly
stood
up
straight
and
grinned
she
scratched
her
red
hair
shifted
her
weight
and
looked
at
snake
i
guess
they
not
coming
she
said
sounding
almost
disappointed
then
she
giggled
well
i
guess
we
got
it
do
move
repeated
hama
incarnate
now
look
began
urson
you
are
perfectly
safe
the
god
continued
unless
you
do
anything
foolish
you
have
shown
great
wisdom
continue
to
show
it
i
have
a
lot
to
explain
to
you
like
what
asked
geo
i
start
with
the
lizards
smiled
the
god
the
what
asked
iimmi
the
singing
lizards
said
hama
you
walked
through
a
grove
of
trees
just
a
few
minutes
ago
you
had
just
been
through
a
series
of
happenings
that
was
probably
the
most
frightening
in
your
life
suddenly
you
heard
a
singing
in
the
trees
what
was
it
i
thought
it
was
a
bird
iimmi
said
but
why
a
bird
asked
the
god
because
that
what
a
bird
sounds
like
stated
urson
impatiently
who
needs
an
old
lizard
singing
to
them
on
a
morning
like
this
your
second
point
is
much
better
than
your
first
said
the
god
you
do
not
need
a
lizard
but
you
did
need
a
bird
a
bird
means
spring
life
good
luck
cheerfulness
you
think
of
a
bird
singing
and
you
think
of
thoughts
that
men
have
been
thinking
for
thousands
upon
thousands
of
years
poets
have
written
of
it
in
every
language
catullus
in
latin
keats
in
english
li
po
in
chinese
darnel
in
new
english
you
expected
a
bird
because
after
what
you
had
been
through
you
needed
to
hear
a
bird
lizards
run
from
under
wet
rocks
scurry
over
gravestones
a
lizard
is
not
what
you
needed
so
what
do
lizards
have
to
do
with
why
we
here
demanded
urson
why
are
you
here
repeated
the
god
subtly
changing
urson
question
there
are
many
reasons
i
am
sure
you
tell
me
some
of
them
you
have
done
wrongs
to
argo
at
least
to
argo
of
leptar
geo
explained
we
have
come
to
undo
them
you
have
kidnaped
the
young
argo
as
well
as
her
mother
apparently
we
have
come
to
take
her
back
you
have
misused
the
jewels
we
have
come
to
take
the
last
one
from
you
hama
smiled
only
a
poet
could
see
the
wisdom
in
such
honesty
i
thought
i
might
have
to
wheedle
to
get
that
much
out
of
you
i
guess
it
was
pretty
certain
that
you
knew
that
much
already
geo
said
true
answered
hama
then
his
tone
changed
do
you
know
how
the
jewels
work
they
shook
their
heads
they
are
basically
very
simple
mechanical
contrivances
which
are
difficult
in
execution
but
simple
in
concept
i
will
explain
human
thoughts
it
was
discovered
after
the
great
fire
during
the
first
glorious
years
of
the
city
of
new
hope
did
not
produce
waves
similar
to
radio
waves
but
the
electrical
synapse
pattern
it
was
found
can
be
read
by
radio
waves
in
the
same
way
a
mine
detector
reads
the
existence
of
metal
radio
geo
said
that
right
hama
said
oh
i
forgot
you
do
know
anything
about
that
at
all
well
i
ca
go
through
the
whole
thing
now
suffice
it
to
say
that
each
of
the
jewels
contains
a
carefully
honed
crystal
which
is
constantly
sending
out
beams
which
can
read
these
thought
patterns
also
the
crystal
acts
like
a
magnifying
glass
or
a
mirror
and
reflects
and
magnifies
the
energy
from
the
brain
into
heat
or
light
or
any
other
kind
of
electromagnetic
radiation
there
i
go
again
so
that
you
can
send
great
bolts
of
heat
with
them
as
you
have
seen
done
but
the
actual
workings
of
them
are
not
important
and
their
ability
to
send
heat
out
is
only
their
secondary
power
their
primary
importance
is
that
they
can
be
used
to
penetrate
the
mind
now
we
come
to
the
lizards
wait
a
minute
geo
said
before
we
get
to
the
lizards
do
you
mean
go
into
minds
like
snake
does
suddenly
he
remembered
that
the
boy
was
not
there
but
the
god
went
on
like
snake
he
said
but
different
snake
was
born
with
the
ability
to
transmute
the
brain
patterns
of
his
thoughts
to
others
in
that
he
has
a
power
something
like
the
jewels
but
nowhere
as
strong
but
with
the
jewels
you
can
jam
a
person
thoughts
just
go
into
his
mind
and
stop
him
from
thinking
asked
iimmi
no
said
the
god
conscious
thought
is
too
powerful
otherwise
you
would
stop
thinking
every
time
snake
spoke
to
you
it
works
another
way
how
many
reasons
does
a
man
have
for
any
single
action
they
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
why
for
example
does
a
man
pull
his
hand
from
a
fire
because
it
hurts
said
urson
why
else
yes
why
else
asked
hama
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
said
iimmi
he
also
pulls
it
out
because
he
knows
that
outside
the
fire
his
hand
is
going
to
hurt
like
the
bird
i
mean
the
lizard
one
reason
we
reacted
like
we
did
was
because
it
sounded
like
a
bird
the
other
reason
was
because
we
wanted
to
hear
a
bird
just
then
the
man
pulls
his
hand
out
because
the
fire
hurts
and
because
he
wants
it
not
to
hurt
in
other
words
geo
summarized
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
for
everything
exactly
explained
hama
and
notice
that
one
of
these
reasons
is
unconscious
but
with
the
jewel
you
can
jam
the
unconscious
reason
so
that
if
a
man
has
his
hand
in
a
fire
you
can
jam
his
unconscious
reason
of
wanting
it
to
stop
hurting
completely
bewildered
and
in
no
less
pain
he
will
stand
there
until
his
wrist
is
a
smoking
nub
geo
reached
over
and
felt
his
severed
arm
dictators
during
the
entire
history
of
this
planet
have
used
similar
techniques
by
not
letting
the
people
of
their
country
know
what
conditions
existed
outside
their
boundaries
they
could
get
the
people
to
fight
to
stay
in
those
conditions
it
was
the
old
adage
convince
a
slave
that
he
free
and
he
will
fight
to
maintain
his
slavery
why
does
a
poet
sing
because
he
likes
music
and
because
silence
frightens
him
why
does
a
thief
steal
to
get
the
goods
from
his
victim
also
to
prove
that
his
victim
can
not
get
him
that
how
argo
got
snake
back
geo
said
to
urson
i
see
now
he
was
just
thinking
of
running
away
and
she
jammed
his
desire
not
to
get
caught
so
he
had
nothing
to
direct
him
in
which
direction
to
run
so
he
ran
where
she
told
him
straight
back
to
her
that
right
hama
said
but
something
else
was
learned
when
these
jewels
were
invented
or
rather
a
lesson
which
history
should
have
taught
us
thousands
of
years
ago
was
finally
driven
home
no
man
can
wield
absolute
power
over
other
men
and
still
retain
his
own
mind
for
no
matter
how
good
his
intentions
are
when
he
takes
up
the
power
his
alternate
reason
is
that
freedom
the
freedom
of
the
people
and
ultimately
his
own
terrifies
him
only
a
man
afraid
of
freedom
would
want
this
power
would
conceive
of
wielding
it
and
that
fear
of
freedom
will
turn
him
into
a
slave
of
this
power
for
this
reason
the
jewels
are
evil
that
is
why
we
have
summoned
you
to
steal
them
from
us
to
steal
them
from
you
asked
geo
why
could
you
have
simply
destroyed
them
when
you
had
them
we
have
already
been
infected
smiled
the
god
we
are
a
small
band
here
on
aptor
to
reach
the
state
of
organization
to
collect
the
scattered
scientific
knowledge
of
the
times
before
the
great
fire
was
not
easy
too
often
the
jewels
have
been
used
and
abused
and
now
we
can
not
destroy
it
we
would
have
to
destroy
ourselves
first
we
kidnaped
argo
and
left
you
the
second
jewel
hoping
that
you
would
come
after
the
third
and
last
one
now
you
have
come
and
now
the
jewel
is
being
stolen
snake
asked
geo
that
right
replied
hama
but
i
thought
he
was
your
spy
geo
said
that
he
is
our
spy
is
his
unconscious
reason
for
his
actions
explained
hama
he
is
aware
only
that
he
is
working
against
the
evil
he
has
seen
in
jordde
spy
is
too
harsh
a
word
for
him
say
rather
little
thief
he
became
a
spy
for
us
quite
unwittingly
when
he
was
on
the
island
as
a
child
with
jordde
i
have
explained
something
to
you
of
how
the
mind
works
we
have
machines
that
can
duplicate
what
snake
does
in
a
similar
way
that
the
jewels
work
this
is
how
the
blind
priestesses
contacted
jordde
and
made
him
their
spy
this
is
how
we
reached
snake
but
he
never
saw
us
never
even
really
talked
to
us
it
was
mainly
because
of
something
he
saw
something
he
saw
when
he
first
got
here
wait
a
minute
iimmi
said
jordde
wanted
to
kill
me
and
did
kill
whitey
because
of
something
we
might
have
seen
i
bet
this
was
the
same
thing
now
what
was
it
hama
smiled
my
telling
you
would
do
no
good
perhaps
you
can
find
out
from
snake
or
my
daughter
argo
incarnate
but
what
do
we
do
now
geo
interrupted
take
the
jewels
back
to
argo
i
mean
argo
on
the
ship
she
already
used
the
jewels
to
control
minds
at
least
snake
so
that
means
she
infected
too
once
you
guessed
the
reason
for
her
infection
said
hama
we
have
been
watching
you
on
our
screens
since
you
landed
do
you
remember
what
the
reason
was
do
you
mean
her
being
jealous
of
her
sister
geo
asked
yes
on
one
side
her
motives
were
truly
patriotic
for
leptar
on
the
other
hand
they
were
selfish
ones
of
power
seeking
but
without
the
selfish
ones
she
would
have
never
gotten
so
far
as
she
did
you
must
bring
young
argo
back
and
give
the
infection
a
chance
to
work
itself
out
but
what
about
the
jewels
asked
geo
all
three
of
them
will
be
together
is
that
a
huge
temptation
someone
must
meet
this
temptation
and
overcome
it
said
hama
you
do
not
know
how
much
danger
they
are
in
while
they
are
here
on
aptor
even
if
the
final
danger
is
only
delayed
that
delay
will
make
it
safer
to
bring
them
to
leptar
suddenly
hama
turned
to
the
screens
and
pushed
a
switch
to
on
position
the
opaque
glass
was
filled
with
a
picture
of
the
interior
of
the
temple
on
the
huge
statue
a
spotlight
was
following
two
microscopic
figures
over
the
statue
shoulder
they
were
climbing
over
the
elbow
hama
increased
the
size
it
was
two
people
not
bugs
climbing
down
the
gigantic
sculptured
figure
they
made
their
way
along
the
forearm
now
to
the
golden
stalks
of
wheat
in
the
god
black
fist
one
and
then
the
other
began
to
shimmy
down
the
stems
they
arrived
at
the
base
and
climbed
over
the
rail
the
screen
enlarged
again
it
snake
said
geo
and
he
got
the
jewel
urson
added
that
argo
with
him
iimmi
put
in
i
mean
one
of
the
argos
they
clustered
around
the
screen
watching
the
congregation
give
way
before
the
two
fearful
children
the
girl
in
the
short
white
tunic
was
holding
onto
snake
shoulder
suddenly
hama
turned
the
picture
off
and
they
looked
away
from
the
screen
now
puzzled
so
you
see
said
the
god
the
jewel
has
already
been
stolen
for
the
sake
of
argo
and
of
hama
carry
the
jewels
back
to
leptar
young
argo
will
help
you
though
her
mother
and
i
are
pained
to
see
her
go
she
is
as
prepared
for
the
journey
as
you
are
if
not
more
will
you
do
it
i
will
iimmi
said
me
too
said
geo
i
guess
so
urson
said
good
smiled
hama
then
come
with
me
he
turned
from
the
screen
and
walked
through
the
door
they
followed
him
down
the
long
stairway
past
the
stone
walls
into
the
hall
and
along
the
back
of
the
church
he
walked
slowly
and
smiled
like
a
man
who
had
waited
long
for
something
finally
arrived
they
turned
out
of
the
temple
and
descended
the
bright
steps
i
wonder
where
the
kids
are
urson
asked
but
hama
led
them
on
across
the
broad
garden
to
where
the
great
black
urns
sat
in
a
row
close
to
a
wall
of
shrubbery
a
woman
old
argo
suddenly
joined
them
she
had
apparently
been
waiting
for
them
she
gave
them
a
silent
smile
of
recognition
and
they
continued
across
the
garden
path
light
fell
through
the
shrubbery
across
her
white
tunic
and
snake
bare
back
as
they
crouched
over
the
contraption
of
coils
and
metal
she
twisted
two
pieces
of
wire
together
in
a
final
connection
as
snake
placed
the
jewel
on
an
improvised
thermocouple
then
they
bent
over
it
and
both
concentrated
their
thoughts
on
the
bead
the
thermocouple
glowed
red
and
electricity
jumped
in
the
copper
veins
turning
the
metal
bone
into
a
magnet
the
armature
tugged
once
around
its
pivot
and
then
tugged
around
once
more
finally
it
was
whipping
around
steadily
the
brushes
on
its
shaft
reversing
the
magnetic
poles
with
each
half
circle
of
the
arc
it
gained
speed
until
it
whirred
into
an
invisible
copper
haze
between
them
hey
she
breathed
look
at
it
go
will
you
just
look
at
it
go
and
the
young
thieves
crouched
over
the
humming
motor
oblivious
to
the
eyes
of
the
elder
gods
that
smiled
at
them
from
the
edge
of
the
green
shift
of
shadow
and
sunlight
by
the
side
of
the
marble
urn
chapter
xi
under
the
trees
she
raised
up
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
the
balding
forehead
of
a
tall
priest
dunderhead
she
said
i
think
cute
then
she
blinked
very
rapidly
and
knuckled
beneath
her
eye
oh
she
added
remembering
i
was
making
yogurt
in
the
biology
laboratory
yesterday
there
two
gallons
of
it
fermenting
under
the
tarantula
cage
remember
to
take
it
out
and
take
care
of
the
hamsters
please
do
forget
the
hamsters
finally
they
started
once
more
around
the
slope
of
the
volcano
and
the
temple
and
grove
fell
black
and
green
away
behind
them
two
days
to
get
to
the
ship
said
geo
squinting
at
the
pale
sky
perhaps
we
had
better
put
the
jewels
together
said
urson
keep
them
out
of
harm
way
since
we
know
their
power
what
do
you
mean
iimmi
asked
urson
took
geo
leather
purse
from
his
belt
then
he
took
the
jewel
from
geo
neck
and
dropped
it
in
the
purse
then
he
held
the
purse
out
for
iimmi
to
do
the
same
i
guess
it
ca
hurt
iimmi
said
dropping
his
chain
into
the
pouch
here
mine
too
argo
said
urson
pulled
the
purse
string
closed
and
tucked
the
pouch
in
at
his
waist
well
said
geo
i
guess
we
head
for
the
river
so
we
can
get
back
to
your
sister
and
jordde
jordde
asked
argo
who
he
he
a
spy
for
the
blind
priestesses
he
also
the
one
who
cut
tongue
out
cut
his
suddenly
she
stopped
that
right
four
arms
his
tongue
i
remember
now
in
the
film
in
the
what
asked
iimmi
what
do
you
remember
argo
turned
to
snake
i
remember
where
i
saw
you
before
you
know
snake
urson
asked
no
i
never
met
him
but
about
a
month
ago
i
saw
a
movie
of
what
happened
it
was
horrible
what
they
did
to
him
what
a
movie
asked
iimmi
huh
said
argo
oh
it
sort
of
like
the
vision
screens
only
you
can
see
things
that
happened
in
the
past
anyway
dunderhead
showed
me
this
film
about
a
month
ago
then
he
took
me
down
to
the
beach
and
said
i
should
have
seen
something
there
because
of
what
i
learned
see
something
iimmi
almost
yelled
what
was
it
he
took
her
shoulder
and
shook
it
what
was
it
you
were
supposed
to
see
why
began
the
girl
startled
because
a
friend
of
mine
was
murdered
and
i
almost
was
too
because
of
something
we
saw
on
that
beach
only
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
began
argo
but
i
do
either
i
could
see
it
so
dunderhead
took
me
back
to
the
temple
snake
geo
asked
do
you
know
what
they
were
supposed
to
see
or
why
argo
was
taken
to
see
it
after
she
was
shown
what
happened
to
you
the
boy
shrugged
iimmi
turned
on
snake
do
you
know
or
are
you
just
not
telling
come
on
now
that
the
only
reason
i
stuck
with
this
so
far
and
i
want
to
know
what
going
on
snake
shook
his
head
i
want
to
know
why
i
was
nearly
killed
shouted
the
negro
you
know
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
iimmi
raised
his
hand
snake
screamed
the
sound
tore
over
the
distended
vocal
cords
then
he
whirled
and
ran
urson
caught
him
and
brought
the
boy
crashing
down
among
leaves
no
you
do
the
giant
growled
you
not
going
to
get
away
from
me
this
time
you
wo
get
away
from
me
again
watch
it
said
argo
you
hurting
him
urson
let
go
hey
ease
up
said
iimmi
snake
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
yell
but
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
very
much
urson
let
the
boy
up
still
mumbling
well
he
not
going
to
get
away
again
when
did
he
get
away
from
you
the
first
time
geo
said
coming
over
to
the
boy
let
him
go
look
snake
do
you
know
what
there
was
about
the
beach
that
was
so
important
snake
nodded
can
you
tell
now
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
glanced
at
urson
you
do
have
to
be
afraid
of
him
geo
said
puzzled
urson
hurt
you
but
snake
shook
his
head
again
well
said
geo
we
ca
make
you
let
get
going
i
bet
i
could
make
him
the
giant
mumbled
no
said
argo
i
do
think
you
could
i
watched
the
last
time
somebody
tried
and
i
do
think
you
could
late
morning
flopped
over
hotly
in
the
sky
and
turned
into
afternoon
the
jungle
became
damp
and
bright
insects
plunged
like
tiny
knives
of
blue
or
scarlet
through
leaves
wet
foliage
brushed
against
their
chests
faces
and
shoulders
why
would
they
show
you
a
film
of
something
awful
before
taking
you
to
the
beach
iimmi
asked
maybe
it
was
supposed
to
have
made
me
more
receptive
to
what
we
saw
said
argo
if
horror
makes
you
receptive
to
what
ever
it
was
said
iimmi
i
should
have
been
about
as
receptive
as
possible
what
do
you
mean
asked
geo
i
just
watched
ten
guys
get
hacked
to
pieces
all
over
the
sand
remember
they
walked
silently
for
a
time
we
come
out
at
the
head
of
the
river
it
a
huge
marsh
that
drains
off
into
the
main
channel
said
argo
presently
late
afternoon
darkened
quickly
i
was
wondering
about
something
geo
said
after
a
little
while
what
asked
argo
hama
said
that
once
the
jewels
had
been
used
to
control
minds
the
person
who
used
them
was
infected
rather
the
infection
was
already
there
corrected
argo
that
just
brought
it
out
yes
said
geo
anyway
hama
also
said
that
he
was
infected
when
did
he
have
to
use
the
jewels
lots
of
times
argo
said
too
many
the
last
time
was
when
i
was
kidnaped
he
used
the
jewel
to
control
pieces
of
that
thing
you
all
killed
in
the
city
of
new
hope
to
come
and
kidnap
me
and
then
leave
the
jewel
in
leptar
a
piece
of
that
monster
geo
exclaimed
no
wonder
it
decayed
so
rapidly
when
it
was
killed
huh
asked
iimmi
argo
i
mean
your
sister
told
me
they
had
managed
to
kill
one
of
the
kidnapers
and
it
melted
the
moment
it
died
we
could
control
the
whole
mass
she
explained
it
really
have
a
mind
but
like
everything
alive
it
has
or
had
the
double
impulse
but
what
did
kidnaping
you
accomplish
anyway
iimmi
asked
argo
grinned
it
brought
you
here
and
now
you
taking
the
jewels
away
is
that
all
asked
iimmi
well
said
argo
is
that
enough
she
paused
for
an
instant
you
know
i
wrote
a
poem
about
all
this
once
the
double
impulse
and
everything
geo
recited
the
dark
chamber
sits
its
twin
where
the
body
floods
begin
and
the
two
are
twinned
again
turning
out
and
turning
how
did
you
know
she
asked
the
dark
chamber
is
hama
temple
geo
said
am
i
right
and
it
twin
is
argo
she
went
on
they
should
be
twins
really
and
then
the
twins
again
are
the
children
the
force
of
age
in
each
one
opposed
to
the
young
force
see
i
see
geo
smiled
and
the
body
floods
turning
in
and
out
that
sort
of
everything
man
does
his
going
and
coming
his
great
ideas
his
achievements
his
little
ideas
too
it
all
comes
from
the
interplay
of
those
four
forces
four
said
urson
i
thought
it
was
just
two
but
it
thousands
argo
explained
the
air
was
drenching
the
leaves
had
been
shiny
before
now
they
dripped
water
on
the
loose
ground
pale
light
lapsed
through
the
branches
shimmered
reflected
from
leaf
to
the
wet
underside
of
leaf
the
ground
became
mud
twice
they
heard
a
sloshing
a
few
feet
away
and
then
the
scuttling
of
an
unseen
animal
i
hope
i
do
step
on
something
that
decides
to
take
a
chunk
out
of
my
foot
i
pretty
good
at
first
aid
argo
said
it
getting
chilly
she
added
just
then
geo
slipped
and
sank
in
a
muddy
pool
urson
raced
to
the
edge
of
the
quicksand
bog
and
grabbed
geo
by
his
good
arm
he
pulled
till
geo
emerged
coated
to
the
thigh
with
gray
mud
you
all
right
urson
asked
you
sure
you
all
right
geo
nodded
rubbing
the
stump
of
his
arm
with
his
good
hand
i
all
right
he
said
the
trees
had
almost
completely
given
out
geo
suddenly
saw
the
whole
swamp
sinking
in
front
of
him
he
splashed
a
step
backwards
but
urson
caught
his
shoulder
the
swamp
was
sinking
though
but
ripples
had
begun
to
appear
over
the
water
spreading
crossing
webbing
the
whole
surface
with
a
net
of
tiny
waves
then
they
began
to
rise
up
green
backs
broke
the
surface
wet
and
slippery
they
were
standing
now
torrents
cascading
their
green
faces
green
chests
three
of
them
now
a
fourth
four
more
and
then
more
and
then
many
more
they
stood
now
these
naked
green
mottled
bodies
geo
felt
a
sudden
tugging
in
his
head
at
his
mind
looking
around
he
saw
that
the
others
felt
it
too
them
urson
started
they
the
ones
who
carried
us
geo
began
the
tug
came
again
and
they
stepped
forward
iimmi
put
his
hand
on
his
head
they
want
us
to
go
with
them
and
suddenly
they
were
going
forward
slipping
into
the
familiar
state
of
which
had
come
when
they
had
crossed
the
river
to
the
city
of
new
hope
or
when
they
had
first
fallen
into
the
sea
wet
hands
fell
on
their
bodies
as
they
were
guided
through
the
swamp
they
were
being
carried
through
deeper
water
now
they
were
walking
over
dry
land
where
the
vegetation
was
thicker
and
slimy
boulders
caught
shards
of
sunset
on
their
wet
flanks
blood
leaking
on
the
gray
the
wet
gray
and
the
green
through
a
rip
in
the
arras
of
vegetation
they
saw
the
moon
push
through
the
clouds
staining
them
silver
a
rock
rose
in
silhouette
against
the
moon
on
the
rock
a
naked
man
stood
staring
at
the
white
disk
white
highlighted
one
side
of
his
body
as
they
passed
he
howled
or
anyway
opened
his
mouth
and
threw
his
head
back
but
their
ears
were
full
of
night
and
could
not
hear
and
dropped
to
all
fours
a
breeze
blew
momentarily
in
the
sudden
plume
of
his
tail
in
the
scraggly
hair
of
the
and
light
lay
white
on
the
points
of
his
ears
his
lengthened
muzzle
his
thinned
hind
legs
the
animal
turned
its
head
once
and
then
scampered
down
the
rock
and
into
the
darkness
as
a
curtain
of
trees
swung
across
the
opened
sky
eyes
of
flame
whipped
ahead
of
them
as
water
swirled
their
knees
once
more
then
the
water
went
down
and
sand
washed
back
under
the
soles
of
their
feet
on
the
dark
beach
the
beating
of
the
sea
the
rush
of
the
river
and
the
odor
of
the
wet
leaves
that
fingered
their
cheeks
prodded
their
shins
and
slapped
against
their
bellies
as
they
moved
forward
all
this
fell
away
red
eyes
wavered
into
flaming
tongues
and
the
tongues
showed
themselves
housed
in
the
mouths
of
a
dozen
caves
light
flickered
on
the
wet
rocks
and
they
entered
the
largest
one
their
eyes
suddenly
focused
once
more
foam
washed
back
and
forth
over
the
sand
floor
and
black
chains
of
weeds
caught
in
crevices
on
the
rock
lengthened
over
the
sand
with
the
inrush
of
water
webbed
hands
released
them
brown
rocks
rose
around
in
the
firelight
they
raised
their
eyes
to
where
the
old
one
sat
the
long
spines
were
strung
with
shrunken
membrane
his
eyes
gray
and
indistinct
were
close
to
the
surface
of
his
broad
nostriled
face
a
film
of
water
trickled
over
the
rock
where
he
sat
others
stood
about
him
on
various
levels
of
the
rock
the
tugging
left
them
and
they
glanced
at
one
another
now
outside
the
cave
it
was
raining
hard
geo
saw
that
argo
hair
had
wet
to
dark
auburn
and
hugged
her
head
now
making
little
streaks
down
her
neck
suddenly
a
voice
boomed
at
them
like
an
echo
more
than
the
reverberation
that
the
cave
would
give
carriers
of
the
jewels
it
began
and
suddenly
geo
realized
that
it
was
the
same
hollowness
that
accompanied
snake
soundless
messages
we
have
brought
you
here
to
give
a
warning
we
are
the
oldest
forms
of
intelligence
on
this
planet
continued
the
old
one
from
the
throne
we
have
watched
from
the
delta
of
the
nile
the
rise
of
the
pyramids
we
have
seen
the
murder
of
caesar
from
the
banks
of
the
tiber
we
watched
the
spanish
armada
destroyed
by
english
and
we
followed
man
great
metal
fish
through
the
ocean
before
the
great
fire
we
have
never
aligned
ourselves
with
either
argo
or
hama
but
rise
in
the
sexless
swell
of
the
ocean
we
can
warn
you
as
we
have
warned
man
before
as
before
some
will
listen
some
will
not
your
minds
are
your
own
now
that
i
pledge
you
now
i
warn
you
cast
the
jewels
into
the
sea
nothing
is
ever
lost
in
the
sea
and
when
the
evil
has
been
washed
from
them
with
time
and
brine
they
will
be
returned
to
man
for
then
time
and
brine
will
have
washed
away
his
imperfections
also
no
living
intelligence
is
free
from
their
infection
nothing
with
the
double
impulse
of
life
but
we
are
old
and
can
hold
them
for
a
million
years
before
we
will
be
so
infected
as
you
are
your
young
race
is
too
condensed
in
its
living
to
tolerate
such
power
at
its
fingers
now
again
i
say
cast
these
into
the
sea
the
knowledge
which
man
needs
to
alleviate
hunger
and
pain
from
the
world
of
men
is
contained
in
two
monasteries
on
this
island
both
have
the
science
to
put
the
jewels
to
use
to
the
good
use
which
is
possible
with
them
both
have
been
infected
in
leptar
however
where
you
carry
these
jewels
there
is
no
way
at
all
to
utilize
them
for
anything
but
evil
there
will
only
be
the
temptation
to
destroy
what
about
me
argo
suddenly
piped
up
i
can
teach
them
all
sorts
of
things
in
leptar
she
took
one
of
snake
hands
we
used
one
for
our
motor
you
will
find
something
else
to
make
your
motor
turn
came
the
voice
you
still
have
to
see
something
that
you
have
not
yet
seen
at
the
beach
demanded
iimmi
yes
nodded
the
old
one
with
something
like
a
sigh
at
the
beach
we
have
a
science
that
allows
us
to
do
things
which
to
you
seem
impossibilities
as
when
we
carried
you
in
the
sea
for
weeks
without
your
body
decaying
we
can
enter
your
mind
as
snake
does
and
we
can
do
much
else
we
have
a
wisdom
which
far
surpasses
even
argo
and
on
aptor
will
you
then
cast
the
jewels
into
the
sea
and
trust
them
with
us
here
urson
interrupted
how
can
we
give
you
the
jewels
he
said
how
can
we
be
sure
you
not
going
to
use
them
against
argo
and
hama
once
you
get
them
you
say
nobody
is
impervious
to
them
and
we
only
got
your
say
so
on
how
long
it
would
take
you
to
fall
victim
you
can
already
influence
minds
that
how
you
got
us
here
and
according
to
hama
that
what
corrupts
and
you
already
done
it
besides
geo
said
there
something
else
we
nearly
messed
this
thing
up
a
dozen
times
trying
to
figure
out
motives
and
counter
motives
and
it
always
comes
back
to
the
same
thing
we
got
a
job
to
do
and
we
ought
to
do
it
we
suppose
to
return
argo
and
the
jewels
to
the
ship
and
that
what
we
doing
he
right
said
iimmi
it
the
general
rule
again
act
on
the
simplest
theory
that
holds
all
the
information
the
old
one
sighed
again
once
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
a
man
who
was
to
maneuver
one
of
the
metal
birds
walked
and
pondered
by
the
sea
he
had
been
given
a
job
to
do
we
tried
to
warn
him
as
we
tried
to
warn
you
but
he
jammed
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
khaki
uniform
and
uttered
to
the
waves
the
words
you
just
uttered
and
the
warning
was
shut
out
of
his
mind
he
scrambled
up
over
the
dunes
on
the
beach
never
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
the
next
morning
at
five
when
the
sun
slanted
red
across
the
air
field
he
climbed
into
his
metal
bird
took
off
flew
for
some
time
over
the
sea
looking
down
on
the
water
like
crinkled
foil
under
the
heightening
sun
until
he
reached
land
again
then
he
did
his
job
he
pressed
a
button
which
released
two
shards
of
fire
metal
in
a
housing
of
cobalt
the
land
flamed
the
sea
boiled
in
the
harbors
and
two
weeks
later
he
was
also
dead
that
which
burned
your
arm
away
poet
burned
away
his
whole
face
boiled
his
lungs
in
his
chest
and
his
brain
in
his
skull
there
was
a
pause
and
then
yes
we
can
control
minds
we
could
have
relieved
the
tiredness
immobilized
the
fear
the
terror
immobilized
all
his
unconscious
reasons
for
doing
what
he
did
just
as
man
can
now
do
with
the
jewels
but
had
we
we
would
have
also
immobilized
the
the
honor
which
he
clung
to
yes
we
can
control
minds
but
we
do
not
now
the
voice
swelled
but
never
since
that
day
on
the
shore
before
the
great
fire
has
the
temptation
to
do
so
been
as
great
as
now
again
the
voice
returned
to
normal
perhaps
and
there
was
almost
humor
in
it
now
the
temptation
is
too
great
even
for
us
perhaps
we
have
reached
the
place
where
the
jewels
would
push
us
just
across
the
line
where
we
have
never
before
gone
make
us
do
those
things
that
we
have
never
done
you
have
heard
our
warning
now
the
choice
i
swear
to
you
is
yours
they
stood
silent
in
the
high
cave
the
fire
on
their
faces
weaving
brightness
and
shadow
geo
turned
to
look
at
the
darkness
outside
the
cave
entrance
out
there
is
the
sea
said
the
voice
again
your
decision
quickly
the
tide
is
coming
in
it
was
snatched
from
their
minds
before
they
could
articulate
it
two
children
saw
a
bright
motor
turning
in
the
shadow
geo
and
iimmi
saw
the
temples
of
argo
in
leptar
then
there
was
something
darker
and
for
a
moment
they
all
saw
all
the
pictures
at
once
a
wave
splashed
across
the
floor
like
twisted
glass
before
the
rock
on
which
the
fire
stood
then
it
flopped
wetly
across
the
burning
driftwood
which
hissed
into
darkness
charred
sticks
turned
glowing
in
the
water
and
were
extinguished
rain
was
buffeting
them
hands
held
them
once
more
pulling
them
into
the
warm
sea
the
darkness
and
then
nothing
snake
was
thinking
again
and
this
time
through
the
captain
eyes
cabin
door
burst
open
in
the
rain
wind
whipped
her
wet
veils
about
her
in
the
door
as
lightning
made
them
transparent
blackening
her
body
outline
jordde
rose
from
his
seat
she
closed
the
door
on
i
have
received
the
signal
from
the
sea
she
said
tomorrow
you
pilot
the
ship
into
the
estuary
captain
voice
but
priestess
argo
i
can
not
take
the
ship
into
aptor
we
already
have
lost
ten
men
i
can
not
sacrifice
and
the
storm
smiled
jordde
if
it
is
like
this
tomorrow
how
can
i
take
her
through
the
rocks
nostrils
flared
as
her
lips
compressed
to
a
chalky
line
she
was
regarding
captain
thoughts
what
is
between
them
this
confused
tension
it
upsets
me
deeply
and
i
am
you
will
pilot
the
boat
to
shore
tomorrow
argo
nearly
hissed
they
have
returned
with
the
jewels
captain
thoughts
they
speak
to
each
other
in
a
code
i
understand
i
am
so
tired
now
i
have
to
protect
my
ship
my
men
that
is
my
job
my
argo
turned
to
the
captain
i
hired
you
to
obey
me
i
order
you
to
pilot
this
ship
to
aptor
shore
tomorrow
morning
captain
thoughts
yes
yes
the
fatigue
and
the
unknowing
but
i
must
fulfill
must
complete
jordde
he
yes
captain
answered
the
mate
anticipating
if
the
weather
is
permitting
sir
i
will
take
the
ship
as
close
as
i
can
get
he
smiled
now
a
thin
curve
over
his
face
and
turned
toward
chapter
xii
roughness
of
sand
beneath
one
of
his
sides
and
the
flare
of
the
sun
on
the
other
his
eyes
were
hot
and
his
lids
were
orange
over
them
he
turned
over
and
reached
out
to
dig
his
fingers
into
the
sand
only
one
hand
closed
then
he
remembered
opening
his
eyes
he
rolled
to
his
knees
the
sand
grated
under
his
knee
caps
looking
out
toward
the
water
he
saw
that
the
sun
hung
only
seeming
inches
above
the
horizon
then
he
saw
the
ship
from
its
course
he
gathered
it
was
heading
toward
the
estuary
of
the
river
down
the
beach
he
began
to
run
toward
where
the
rocks
and
vegetation
cut
off
the
end
of
the
beach
the
sand
under
his
feet
was
cool
a
moment
later
he
saw
iimmi
dark
figure
come
from
the
jungle
he
was
heading
for
the
same
place
geo
hailed
him
and
panting
they
joined
each
other
then
together
they
continued
toward
the
rocks
as
they
broke
through
the
first
sheet
of
foliage
they
bumped
into
the
girl
who
stood
knuckling
her
eyes
in
the
shadow
of
the
broad
palm
fronds
when
she
recognized
them
she
joined
them
silently
finally
they
reached
the
outcropping
of
rock
a
few
hundred
feet
up
the
river
bank
the
rain
had
swelled
the
river
mouth
to
tremendous
violence
it
vomited
surges
of
brown
water
into
the
ocean
frothed
against
rocks
and
boiled
opaquely
below
them
it
was
nearly
half
again
as
wide
as
geo
remembered
it
although
the
sky
was
clear
beyond
the
brown
bile
of
the
river
the
sea
snarled
viciously
and
bared
white
teeth
in
the
sun
it
took
another
fifteen
minutes
for
the
boat
to
maneuver
through
the
granite
spikes
toward
the
rocky
embankment
a
hundred
yards
away
glancing
down
into
the
turbulence
argo
breathed
gee
but
that
was
the
only
human
sound
against
the
water
roaring
the
boat
prow
doffed
in
the
swell
and
then
at
last
her
plank
swung
out
and
bumped
unsteadily
on
the
rocky
bank
figures
were
gathering
on
deck
hey
argo
said
pointing
toward
one
that
sis
where
the
hell
are
snake
and
urson
iimmi
asked
that
snake
down
there
geo
said
look
he
pointed
with
his
nub
they
could
see
snake
crouched
near
the
gangplank
itself
he
was
behind
a
ledge
of
rock
invisible
to
the
people
on
the
ship
apparently
but
plain
to
geo
and
his
companions
watch
it
geo
said
i
going
down
there
you
stay
here
he
ducked
off
through
the
vines
keeping
in
sight
of
the
rocks
edge
and
the
boiling
foam
the
ship
grew
before
him
and
at
last
he
reached
a
sheltered
rise
just
ten
feet
above
the
nest
of
rock
in
which
the
boy
was
crouching
geo
looked
out
at
the
boat
jordde
stood
at
the
head
of
the
gangplank
the
eighteen
feet
of
board
was
unsteady
with
the
roll
of
the
ship
jordde
held
something
like
a
black
whip
in
his
hand
only
the
end
went
to
a
contraption
strapped
to
his
back
with
the
lash
raised
he
stepped
onto
the
shifting
plank
geo
wondered
what
the
whip
contrivance
was
the
answer
came
with
the
hollow
sound
of
snake
thoughts
is
machine
he
use
to
cut
tongue
with
only
on
whip
now
not
wire
so
snake
knew
he
was
just
behind
him
as
he
was
trying
to
figure
exactly
the
implications
of
what
snake
had
said
suddenly
with
the
speed
of
a
bird
shadow
snake
leaped
from
his
hiding
place
and
landed
on
the
shore
end
of
the
plank
he
recovered
from
his
crouch
and
rushed
down
the
plank
toward
jordde
apparently
intending
to
knock
him
from
the
board
jordde
raised
the
lash
and
it
fell
across
the
boy
shoulder
it
land
hard
it
just
dropped
but
snake
suddenly
reeled
and
went
down
on
one
knee
grabbing
the
sides
of
the
plank
geo
was
close
enough
to
hear
the
boy
scream
i
cut
your
tongue
out
once
with
this
thing
jordde
said
matter
of
factly
now
i
going
to
cut
the
rest
of
you
to
pieces
he
adjusted
a
control
at
his
belt
and
raised
the
lash
again
geo
leapt
for
the
plank
he
faced
jordde
over
the
crouching
boy
he
wondered
how
wise
it
had
been
then
he
had
to
stop
wondering
and
try
to
duck
the
falling
lash
he
could
it
landed
with
only
the
weight
of
gravity
brushing
his
cheek
then
dropping
across
his
shoulder
and
down
his
back
he
screamed
the
whole
side
of
his
face
seemed
seared
away
and
an
inch
crevice
burned
into
his
shoulder
and
back
the
length
it
touched
him
he
bit
into
white
fire
trying
not
to
leap
aside
into
the
foaming
chasm
between
rocks
and
boat
as
the
lash
rasped
over
his
shoulder
sweat
flooded
his
eyes
his
good
arm
which
held
the
edge
of
the
plank
was
shaking
like
a
plucked
string
on
a
loose
guitar
snake
lunged
back
against
him
almost
knocking
him
over
when
geo
blinked
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
he
saw
two
bright
welts
over
snake
shoulder
he
also
saw
that
jordde
had
stepped
out
upon
the
plank
and
was
smiling
when
the
line
fell
again
he
was
sure
just
what
happened
he
leaned
in
one
direction
and
suddenly
snake
was
a
dive
of
legs
in
the
other
now
snake
was
just
four
sets
of
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
plank
geo
screamed
again
and
shook
two
sets
of
fingers
disappeared
from
one
side
of
the
board
and
reappeared
on
the
other
as
jordde
raised
the
lash
a
fourth
time
to
rid
the
plank
of
this
last
nuisance
the
fingers
worked
rapidly
forward
toward
jordde
feet
until
suddenly
an
arm
raised
from
beneath
the
plank
grabbed
jordde
foot
and
tugged
the
lash
fell
far
from
geo
who
was
still
trembling
trying
to
move
backwards
off
the
unsteady
plank
and
keep
from
vomiting
at
the
same
time
jordde
tripped
but
turned
in
time
to
grab
the
edge
of
the
ship
gate
and
steady
himself
at
the
same
time
one
leg
and
then
another
came
up
the
other
side
of
the
plank
and
then
snake
rolled
to
a
crouching
position
on
the
board
top
geo
got
his
feet
under
him
now
and
stumbled
backwards
off
the
plank
and
then
sat
down
hard
a
few
feet
back
on
the
rocks
he
clutched
his
good
arm
across
his
stomach
and
without
lowering
his
eyes
leaned
forward
to
cool
his
back
jordde
on
the
board
now
lashed
the
whip
sideways
snake
leaped
a
foot
from
the
plank
as
the
line
swung
beneath
his
feet
all
four
arms
went
spidering
out
to
regain
equilibrium
the
whip
struck
the
side
of
the
boat
left
a
burn
along
the
hull
and
came
swinging
back
again
snake
leapt
once
more
and
made
it
suddenly
there
was
a
shadow
over
him
and
geo
saw
urson
stride
up
to
the
end
of
the
plank
his
back
to
geo
he
crouched
at
the
head
all
right
now
try
someone
a
little
bigger
than
you
come
on
kid
get
off
there
i
want
my
turn
urson
sword
was
drawn
snake
turned
grabbed
at
something
on
urson
but
the
big
man
knocked
him
away
as
he
leapt
diagonally
onto
the
shore
urson
laughed
over
his
shoulder
you
do
want
the
ones
around
my
neck
he
called
back
here
keep
these
for
me
he
tossed
the
leather
purse
from
his
belt
back
to
the
shore
snake
landed
just
as
jordde
flung
the
lash
out
again
urson
must
have
caught
the
line
across
his
chest
because
they
saw
his
back
suddenly
stiffen
then
he
leapt
forward
and
came
down
with
his
sword
so
hard
that
had
jordde
still
been
there
his
leg
would
have
come
off
jordde
leapt
back
onto
the
edge
of
the
ship
and
the
sword
sliced
three
inches
into
the
plank
as
urson
tried
to
pull
the
blade
out
once
more
jordde
sent
his
whip
singing
again
it
wrapped
urson
like
a
black
serpent
and
it
did
come
loose
urson
howled
he
flung
his
sword
forward
which
probably
only
by
accident
thwunked
seventeen
inches
through
jordde
abdomen
he
bent
forward
grabbed
the
line
with
both
hands
and
tugged
backwards
screaming
jordde
took
two
steps
onto
the
plank
his
mouth
open
his
eyes
closed
and
fell
over
the
side
urson
heaved
backwards
and
toppled
from
the
other
side
for
a
moment
they
hung
with
the
whip
between
them
over
the
board
the
ship
heaved
rolled
to
the
plank
swiveled
came
loose
and
with
the
board
on
top
of
them
they
crashed
into
the
water
geo
and
snake
were
at
the
rocks
edge
iimmi
and
argo
were
coming
up
behind
them
below
them
limbs
and
board
bobbed
through
the
foam
once
the
line
had
somehow
looped
around
urson
neck
and
the
plank
had
turned
up
almost
on
end
then
they
went
under
again
with
nothing
between
it
and
the
rock
wall
of
shore
the
boat
began
to
roll
in
with
each
swell
it
came
in
six
feet
and
then
leaned
out
three
then
it
came
back
another
six
it
took
four
swells
the
time
of
four
very
deep
breaths
until
the
side
of
the
boat
was
grating
up
against
the
rocks
geo
could
hear
the
plank
splintering
down
in
the
water
but
the
sound
of
the
water
blanketed
anything
else
that
was
breaking
down
there
geo
took
two
steps
backwards
clutched
at
his
stubbed
arm
and
threw
up
somebody
the
captain
was
calling
get
her
away
from
the
rocks
away
from
the
rocks
before
she
goes
to
pieces
iimmi
took
geo
arm
come
on
boy
he
said
and
managed
to
haul
him
onto
the
ship
argo
and
snake
leapt
on
behind
them
as
the
boat
floundered
away
from
the
shore
geo
leaned
against
the
rail
below
him
the
water
turned
on
itself
in
the
rocks
thrashed
along
the
river
side
and
then
as
he
raised
his
eyes
stretched
out
along
the
bright
blade
of
the
beach
the
long
sand
that
rimmed
the
island
dropped
away
from
them
a
stately
and
austere
arc
gathering
in
its
curve
all
the
sun
glare
and
throwing
it
back
on
wave
and
on
wave
his
back
hurt
his
stomach
was
shriveled
and
shaken
like
an
old
man
palsied
fist
his
arm
was
gone
and
urson
and
then
argo
said
look
at
the
beach
geo
flung
his
eyes
up
and
tried
in
one
moment
to
envelop
whatever
he
saw
whatever
it
would
be
beneath
the
roar
was
a
tide
of
quiet
the
sand
along
the
naked
crescent
was
dull
at
depressions
mirror
bright
at
rises
at
the
jungle
edge
leaves
and
fronds
sped
rippling
along
the
foliage
each
single
fragment
in
that
green
carpet
hung
up
in
the
sun
was
one
leaf
he
reflected
with
two
sides
and
an
entire
system
of
skeleton
and
veins
as
his
hand
and
arm
had
been
and
maybe
one
day
would
drop
off
too
he
looked
from
rock
to
rock
now
each
was
different
shaped
and
lined
distinctly
but
losing
detail
as
the
ship
floated
out
as
the
memory
of
his
entire
adventure
was
losing
detail
that
one
there
was
like
a
bull
head
half
submerged
those
two
flat
ones
together
on
the
sand
looked
like
the
stretched
wings
of
eagles
the
waves
measured
and
magnificent
followed
one
another
onto
the
sand
like
the
varying
never
duplicated
rhythm
of
a
good
poem
peaceful
ordered
and
calm
he
tried
to
pour
the
chaos
of
urson
drowning
from
his
mind
onto
the
water
it
flowed
into
each
wave
trough
in
which
it
rode
suddenly
quiet
up
to
the
beach
he
spread
the
pain
in
his
own
body
over
the
web
of
foam
and
green
shimmering
and
was
surprised
because
it
fit
easily
hung
there
well
quieted
very
much
quieted
somewhere
at
the
foot
of
his
brain
an
understanding
was
beginning
to
effloresce
with
the
sea
water
under
the
sun
geo
turned
away
from
the
rail
and
with
the
wet
deck
slipping
under
his
bare
feet
he
walked
toward
the
forecastle
he
released
his
broken
limb
and
his
hand
hung
at
his
side
when
snake
came
down
that
evening
geo
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
bunk
following
the
grain
of
the
wood
on
the
bottom
of
the
bed
above
his
he
had
his
good
arm
behind
his
neck
now
snake
touched
his
shoulder
what
is
it
geo
asked
turning
on
his
side
and
sitting
out
from
under
the
bunk
snake
held
out
the
leather
purse
to
geo
huh
geo
asked
did
you
give
them
to
argo
yet
snake
nodded
well
why
did
she
take
them
look
i
do
want
to
see
them
again
snake
pushed
the
purse
toward
him
again
and
added
geo
took
the
purse
opened
the
draw
string
and
turned
the
contents
out
in
his
hand
there
were
three
chains
on
each
of
which
was
a
gold
coin
fastened
by
a
hole
near
the
edge
geo
frowned
how
come
these
are
in
here
he
asked
i
thought
where
are
the
jewels
snake
said
switched
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
geo
what
is
it
want
tell
you
i
do
care
what
you
want
you
little
thief
geo
grabbed
him
by
the
shoulder
tell
me
from
back
with
blind
snake
explained
rapidly
ask
me
how
to
use
when
you
and
iimmi
exploring
and
after
that
no
listen
to
thoughts
bad
thoughts
bad
but
he
geo
started
he
saved
your
life
what
is
snake
said
end
you
saw
his
thoughts
at
the
end
asked
geo
what
did
he
think
sleep
snake
said
of
hate
lot
of
bad
hate
there
was
a
pause
in
the
voice
in
his
head
love
geo
began
to
cry
a
bubble
of
sound
in
the
back
of
his
throat
burst
and
he
turned
onto
the
pillow
and
tried
to
bite
through
the
sound
with
his
teeth
the
tiredness
the
fear
for
urson
for
his
arm
and
the
change
which
hurt
his
whole
body
ached
his
back
hurt
in
two
sharp
lines
and
he
could
stop
crying
iimmi
who
had
now
decided
to
take
the
bunk
above
geo
came
back
a
few
minutes
after
mess
geo
had
just
awakened
geo
laughed
i
found
out
what
it
was
we
saw
on
the
beach
that
made
us
so
dangerous
how
asked
iimmi
when
what
was
it
same
time
you
did
geo
said
i
just
looked
and
then
snake
explained
the
details
of
it
to
me
later
when
iimmi
repeated
i
just
took
a
nap
and
he
went
through
the
whole
thing
with
me
then
what
was
it
you
saw
we
saw
well
first
of
all
do
you
remember
what
jordde
was
before
he
was
shipwrecked
on
aptor
did
argo
say
he
was
studying
to
be
a
priest
old
argo
i
mean
right
said
geo
now
do
you
remember
what
my
theory
was
about
what
we
saw
did
you
have
a
theory
iimmi
asked
about
horror
and
pain
making
you
receptive
to
whatever
it
was
oh
that
iimmi
said
i
remember
yes
i
was
also
right
about
that
now
add
to
all
this
some
theory
from
hama
lecture
on
the
double
impulse
of
life
it
was
a
thing
we
saw
it
was
a
situation
or
rather
an
experience
we
had
also
it
did
have
to
be
on
the
beach
it
could
have
happened
anywhere
man
and
his
constantly
diametric
motivations
is
always
trying
to
reconcile
opposites
in
fact
you
can
say
that
an
action
a
reconciliation
of
the
duality
of
his
motivation
now
take
all
that
we
been
through
the
confusion
the
pain
the
disorder
then
reconcile
that
with
the
great
order
obvious
in
something
like
the
sea
with
its
rhythm
its
tides
and
waves
its
overpowering
calm
or
the
ordering
of
cells
in
a
leaf
or
a
constellation
of
stars
if
you
can
do
it
something
happens
to
you
you
grow
you
become
a
bigger
person
able
to
understand
or
reconcile
more
all
right
said
iimmi
and
that
what
we
saw
or
the
experience
we
had
when
we
looked
at
the
beach
from
the
ship
this
morning
chaos
caught
in
order
the
order
defining
chaos
all
right
again
iimmi
said
and
i
even
assume
that
jordde
knew
that
the
two
impulses
of
this
experience
were
one
something
terrible
and
confused
like
seeing
ten
men
hacked
to
pieces
by
vampires
or
seeing
a
film
of
a
little
boy
getting
his
tongue
pulled
out
or
coming
through
what
we
came
through
since
we
landed
on
aptor
and
two
something
calm
and
ordered
like
the
beach
and
the
sea
now
why
would
he
want
to
kill
someone
simply
because
they
might
have
gone
through
what
amounts
i
guess
to
the
basic
religious
experience
you
picked
just
the
right
word
geo
smiled
now
jordde
was
a
novice
in
the
not
too
liberal
religion
of
argo
jordde
and
snake
had
been
through
nearly
as
much
on
aptor
as
we
had
and
they
survived
and
they
also
emerged
from
that
jungle
of
horror
onto
that
great
arcing
rhythm
of
waves
and
sand
and
they
went
through
just
what
you
and
i
and
argo
went
through
little
argo
i
mean
and
it
was
just
at
that
point
when
the
blind
priestesses
of
argo
made
contact
with
jordde
they
did
so
by
means
of
those
vision
screens
we
saw
them
with
which
can
receive
sound
and
pictures
from
just
about
any
place
but
can
also
project
at
least
sound
to
just
about
anywhere
too
in
other
words
right
in
the
middle
of
this
religious
or
mystic
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
experience
a
voice
materialized
out
of
thin
air
that
claimed
to
the
voice
of
the
goddess
have
you
any
idea
what
this
did
to
his
mind
i
imagine
it
took
all
the
real
significance
out
of
the
whole
thing
iimmi
said
it
would
for
me
it
did
said
geo
jordde
was
what
you
call
stable
before
that
if
anything
this
made
him
more
so
it
also
stopped
his
mental
functioning
from
working
in
the
normal
way
and
snake
who
was
reading
his
mind
at
the
time
suddenly
saw
himself
watching
the
terrifying
sealing
up
process
of
an
active
and
competent
if
not
healthy
mind
he
saw
it
again
in
urson
it
apparently
a
pretty
stiff
thing
to
watch
that
why
he
stopped
reading
urson
thoughts
the
idea
of
stealing
the
jewels
for
himself
was
slowly
eating
away
urson
balance
the
understanding
the
ability
to
reconcile
disparities
like
the
incident
with
the
blue
lizard
things
like
that
all
of
which
were
signs
we
did
get
snake
contacted
hama
by
telepathy
almost
accidentally
and
hama
was
something
to
hold
onto
for
the
boy
still
why
did
jordde
want
to
kill
anybody
who
had
experienced
this
voice
of
god
and
all
because
jordde
had
by
now
managed
to
do
what
a
static
mind
always
does
the
situation
the
beach
the
whole
thing
suddenly
meant
for
him
the
revelation
of
a
concrete
god
now
he
knew
that
snake
had
contacted
something
also
something
which
the
blind
priestesses
told
him
was
thoroughly
evil
an
enemy
a
devil
on
the
raft
on
the
boat
he
religiously
tried
to
snake
till
at
last
in
evangelical
fury
he
cut
the
boy
tongue
out
with
the
electric
generator
and
the
hot
wire
which
the
blind
priestesses
had
given
him
before
he
left
why
did
he
want
to
get
rid
of
anybody
who
had
seen
his
beach
a
sacred
place
to
him
by
now
one
because
the
devils
were
too
strong
and
he
did
want
anybody
else
possessed
by
them
snake
had
been
too
much
trouble
resisting
conversion
and
two
because
he
was
jealous
that
someone
else
might
have
that
moment
of
exaltation
and
hear
the
voice
of
the
goddess
also
in
other
words
summarized
iimmi
he
thought
what
happened
to
him
and
snake
was
something
supernatural
actually
connected
with
the
beach
itself
and
did
want
it
to
happen
to
anybody
else
that
right
said
geo
lying
back
in
his
bunk
which
is
sort
of
understandable
they
did
come
in
contact
with
any
of
the
technology
of
aptor
and
so
it
might
well
have
seemed
that
way
iimmi
leaned
back
also
yeah
he
said
i
can
see
how
the
same
thing
almost
almost
might
have
happened
to
me
if
everything
had
been
the
same
geo
closed
his
eyes
snake
came
down
and
took
the
top
bunk
and
when
he
slept
snake
told
him
of
urson
of
his
last
thoughts
and
surprisingly
things
he
mostly
knew
emerging
from
the
forecastle
the
next
morning
he
felt
bright
sunlight
slice
across
his
face
he
had
to
squint
and
when
he
did
so
he
saw
her
sitting
on
the
stretched
canvas
topping
of
a
suspended
lifeboat
hi
up
there
he
called
hello
she
called
down
how
are
you
feeling
geo
shrugged
argo
slipped
her
feet
over
the
gunwale
and
with
paper
bag
in
hand
dropped
to
the
deck
she
bobbed
up
next
to
his
shoulder
grinned
and
said
hey
come
on
back
with
me
i
want
to
show
you
something
sure
he
followed
her
suddenly
she
looked
serious
your
arm
is
worrying
you
why
geo
shrugged
you
do
feel
like
a
whole
person
i
guess
you
not
really
a
whole
person
do
be
silly
said
argo
besides
maybe
snake
will
let
you
have
one
of
his
how
are
the
medical
facilities
in
leptar
i
do
think
they
up
to
anything
like
that
we
did
grafting
of
limbs
back
in
aptor
argo
said
a
most
interesting
way
we
got
around
the
antibody
problem
too
you
see
but
that
was
back
in
aptor
geo
said
this
is
the
real
world
going
into
now
maybe
i
can
get
a
doctor
from
the
temple
to
come
over
she
shrugged
and
then
maybe
i
wo
be
able
to
it
a
pleasant
thought
geo
said
when
they
reached
the
back
of
the
ship
argo
took
out
a
contraption
from
the
paper
bag
i
salvaged
this
in
my
tunic
hope
i
dried
it
off
well
enough
last
night
it
your
motor
geo
said
said
argo
she
put
it
on
a
low
set
of
lockers
by
the
back
wall
how
are
you
going
to
work
it
he
asked
it
got
to
have
that
stuff
electricity
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
shoe
a
centipede
argo
assured
him
she
reached
behind
the
locker
and
pulled
up
a
strange
gizmo
of
glass
and
wire
i
got
the
lens
from
sis
she
explained
she
awfully
nice
really
she
says
i
can
have
my
own
laboratory
all
to
myself
and
i
said
she
could
have
all
the
politics
which
i
think
was
wise
of
me
considering
do
you
she
bent
over
the
contraption
now
this
lens
here
focuses
the
sunlight
is
it
a
beautiful
day
on
these
thermocouples
i
got
the
extra
metal
from
the
ship
smith

sweet
hey

to
have
to
compare
poems

whole
handful

of
this

it
up
here
she
fastened
two
wires
to
two
other
wires
adjusted
the
lens
and
the
tips
of
the
thermocouple
glowed
red
the
armature
tugged
once
around
its
pivot
and
then
tugged
around
once
more
geo
glanced
up
and
saw
snake
and
iimmi
standing
above
them
looking
over
the
rail
on
the
roof
they
grinned
at
each
other
and
then
geo
looked
back
at
the
motor
it
whipped
around
steadily
gaining
speed
until
it
whirred
into
an
invisible
copper
haze
look
at
that
thing
go
breathed
argo
will
you
just
look
at
that
thing
go
quest
amid
futurity
ruins

strange
impetus
that

different
humans
