into
the
room
pen
in
bought
did
you
say
all
these
things
has
my
little
spendthrift
been
wasting
money
again
yes
but
torvald
this
year
we
really
can
let
ourselves
go
a
little
this
is
the
first
christmas
that
we
have
not
needed
to
economize
still
you
know
we
ca
spend
money
recklessly
yes
torvald
we
may
be
a
wee
bit
more
reckless
now
may
we
just
a
tiny
wee
bit
you
are
going
to
have
a
big
salary
and
earn
lots
and
lots
of
money
yes
after
the
new
year
but
then
it
will
be
a
whole
quarter
before
the
salary
is
due
pooh
we
can
borrow
till
then
nora
up
to
her
and
takes
her
playfully
by
the
the
same
little
featherhead
suppose
now
that
i
borrowed
fifty
pounds
today
and
you
spent
it
all
in
the
christmas
week
and
then
on
new
year
eve
a
slate
fell
on
my
head
and
killed
me
and
her
hands
over
his
oh
do
say
such
horrid
things
still
suppose
that
happened
what
then
if
that
were
to
happen
i
do
suppose
i
should
care
whether
i
owed
money
or
not
yes
but
what
about
the
people
who
had
lent
it
they
who
would
bother
about
them
i
should
not
know
who
they
were
that
is
like
a
woman
but
seriously
nora
you
know
what
i
think
about
that
no
debt
no
borrowing
there
can
be
no
freedom
or
beauty
about
a
home
life
that
depends
on
borrowing
and
debt
we
two
have
kept
bravely
on
the
straight
road
so
far
and
we
will
go
on
the
same
way
for
the
short
time
longer
that
there
need
be
any
struggle
towards
the
as
you
please
torvald
come
come
my
little
skylark
must
not
droop
her
wings
what
is
this
is
my
little
squirrel
out
of
temper
out
his
nora
what
do
you
think
i
have
got
here
round
money
there
you
are
her
some
do
you
think
i
know
what
a
lot
is
wanted
for
housekeeping
at
ten
shillings
a
pound
two
pounds
thank
you
thank
you
torvald
that
will
keep
me
going
for
a
long
time
indeed
it
must
yes
yes
it
will
but
come
here
and
let
me
show
you
what
i
have
bought
and
ah
so
cheap
look
here
is
a
new
suit
for
ivar
and
a
sword
and
a
horse
and
a
trumpet
for
bob
and
a
doll
and
dolly
bedstead
for
they
are
very
plain
but
anyway
she
will
soon
break
them
in
pieces
and
here
are
and
handkerchiefs
for
the
maids
old
anne
ought
really
to
have
something
better
and
what
is
in
this
parcel
no
no
you
must
see
that
till
this
evening
very
well
but
now
tell
me
you
extravagant
little
person
what
would
you
like
for
yourself
for
myself
oh
i
am
sure
i
do
want
anything
yes
but
you
must
tell
me
something
reasonable
that
you
would
particularly
like
to
have
no
i
really
ca
think
of
anything
unless
torvald
well
with
his
coat
buttons
and
without
raising
her
eyes
to
if
you
really
want
to
give
me
something
you
might
you
might
well
out
with
it
you
might
give
me
money
torvald
only
just
as
much
as
you
can
afford
and
then
one
of
these
days
i
will
buy
something
with
it
but
nora
oh
do
dear
torvald
please
please
do
then
i
will
wrap
it
up
in
beautiful
gilt
paper
and
hang
it
on
the
christmas
tree
would
that
be
fun
what
are
little
people
called
that
are
always
wasting
money
spendthrifts
i
know
let
us
do
as
you
suggest
torvald
and
then
i
shall
have
time
to
think
what
i
am
most
in
want
of
that
is
a
very
sensible
plan
is
it
indeed
it
is
that
is
to
say
if
you
were
really
to
save
out
of
the
money
i
give
you
and
then
really
buy
something
for
yourself
but
if
you
spend
it
all
on
the
housekeeping
and
any
number
of
unnecessary
things
then
i
merely
have
to
pay
up
again
oh
but
torvald
you
ca
deny
it
my
dear
little
nora
his
arm
round
her
it
a
sweet
little
spendthrift
but
she
uses
up
a
deal
of
money
one
would
hardly
believe
how
expensive
such
little
persons
are
it
a
shame
to
say
that
i
do
really
save
all
i
can
that
very
true
all
you
can
but
you
save
anything
quietly
and
you
have
any
idea
how
many
expenses
we
skylarks
and
squirrels
have
torvald
you
are
an
odd
little
soul
very
like
your
father
you
always
find
some
new
way
of
wheedling
money
out
of
me
and
as
soon
as
you
have
got
it
it
seems
to
melt
in
your
hands
you
never
know
where
it
has
gone
still
one
must
take
you
as
you
are
it
is
in
the
blood
for
indeed
it
is
true
that
you
can
inherit
these
things
nora
ah
i
wish
i
had
inherited
many
of
papa
qualities
and
i
would
not
wish
you
to
be
anything
but
just
what
you
are
my
sweet
little
skylark
but
do
you
know
it
strikes
me
that
you
are
looking
rather
what
shall
i
say
rather
uneasy
today
do
i
you
do
really
look
straight
at
me
at
well
his
finger
at
has
miss
been
breaking
rules
in
town
today
no
what
makes
you
think
that
has
she
paid
a
visit
to
the
confectioner
no
i
assure
you
torvald
not
been
nibbling
sweets
no
certainly
not
not
even
taken
a
bite
at
a
macaroon
or
two
no
torvald
i
assure
you
really
there
there
of
course
i
was
only
joking
to
the
table
on
the
i
should
not
think
of
going
against
your
wishes
no
i
am
sure
of
that
besides
you
gave
me
your
word
up
to
keep
your
little
christmas
secrets
to
yourself
my
darling
they
will
all
be
revealed
tonight
when
the
christmas
tree
is
lit
no
doubt
did
you
remember
to
invite
doctor
rank
no
but
there
is
no
need
as
a
matter
of
course
he
will
come
to
dinner
with
us
however
i
will
ask
him
when
he
comes
in
this
morning
i
have
ordered
some
good
wine
nora
you
ca
think
how
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
evening
so
am
i
and
how
the
children
will
enjoy
themselves
torvald
it
is
splendid
to
feel
that
one
has
a
perfectly
safe
appointment
and
a
big
enough
income
it
delightful
to
think
of
it
it
wonderful
do
you
remember
last
christmas
for
a
full
three
weeks
beforehand
you
shut
yourself
up
every
evening
till
long
after
midnight
making
ornaments
for
the
christmas
tree
and
all
the
other
fine
things
that
were
to
be
a
surprise
to
us
it
was
the
dullest
three
weeks
i
ever
spent
i
did
find
it
dull
but
there
was
precious
little
result
nora
oh
you
should
tease
me
about
that
again
how
could
i
help
the
cat
going
in
and
tearing
everything
to
pieces
of
course
you
could
poor
little
girl
you
had
the
best
of
intentions
to
please
us
all
and
that
the
main
thing
but
it
is
a
good
thing
that
our
hard
times
are
over
yes
it
is
really
wonderful
this
time
i
need
sit
here
and
be
dull
all
alone
and
you
need
ruin
your
dear
eyes
and
your
pretty
little
hands
her
no
torvald
i
need
any
longer
need
i
it
wonderfully
lovely
to
hear
you
say
so
his
now
i
will
tell
you
how
i
have
been
thinking
we
ought
to
arrange
things
torvald
as
soon
as
christmas
is
over
bell
rings
in
the
there
the
bell
tidies
the
room
a
there
someone
at
the
door
what
a
nuisance
if
it
is
a
caller
remember
i
am
not
at
home
the
a
lady
to
see
you
a
stranger
ask
her
to
come
in
helmer
the
doctor
came
at
the
same
time
sir
did
he
go
straight
into
my
room
yes
sir
helmer
into
his
room
maid
linde
is
in
traveling
dress
and
shuts
the
a
dejected
and
timid
how
do
you
do
nora
how
do
you
do
you
do
recognize
me
i
suppose
no
i
do
know
yes
to
be
sure
i
seem
to
yes
christine
is
it
really
you
yes
it
is
i
christine
to
think
of
my
not
recognising
you
and
yet
how
could
i
a
gentle
how
you
have
altered
christine
yes
i
have
indeed
in
nine
ten
long
years
is
it
so
long
since
we
met
i
suppose
it
is
the
last
eight
years
have
been
a
happy
time
for
me
i
can
tell
you
and
so
now
you
have
come
into
the
town
and
have
taken
this
long
journey
in
winter
that
was
plucky
of
you
i
arrived
by
steamer
this
morning
to
have
some
fun
at
of
course
how
delightful
we
will
have
such
fun
together
but
take
off
your
things
you
are
not
cold
i
hope
now
we
will
sit
down
by
the
stove
and
be
cosy
no
take
this
i
will
sit
here
in
the
her
now
you
look
like
your
old
self
again
it
was
only
the
first
moment
you
are
a
little
paler
christine
and
perhaps
a
little
thinner
and
much
much
older
nora
perhaps
a
little
older
very
very
little
certainly
not
much
suddenly
and
speaks
what
a
thoughtless
creature
i
am
chattering
away
like
this
my
poor
dear
christine
do
forgive
me
what
do
you
mean
nora
poor
christine
you
are
a
widow
yes
it
is
three
years
ago
now
yes
i
knew
i
saw
it
in
the
papers
i
assure
you
christine
i
meant
ever
so
often
to
write
to
you
at
the
time
but
i
always
put
it
off
and
something
always
prevented
me
i
quite
understand
dear
it
was
very
bad
of
me
christine
poor
thing
how
you
must
have
suffered
and
he
left
you
nothing
no
and
no
children
no
nothing
at
all
then
not
even
any
sorrow
or
grief
to
live
upon
incredulously
at
but
christine
is
that
possible
sadly
and
strokes
her
it
sometimes
happens
nora
so
you
are
quite
alone
how
dreadfully
sad
that
must
be
i
have
three
lovely
children
you
ca
see
them
just
now
for
they
are
out
with
their
nurse
but
now
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
no
no
i
want
to
hear
about
you
no
you
must
begin
i
must
be
selfish
today
today
i
must
only
think
of
your
affairs
but
there
is
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
do
you
know
we
have
just
had
a
great
piece
of
good
luck
no
what
is
it
just
fancy
my
husband
has
been
made
manager
of
the
bank
your
husband
what
good
luck
yes
tremendous
a
barrister
profession
is
such
an
uncertain
thing
especially
if
he
wo
undertake
unsavoury
cases
and
naturally
torvald
has
never
been
willing
to
do
that
and
i
quite
agree
with
him
you
may
imagine
how
pleased
we
are
he
is
to
take
up
his
work
in
the
bank
at
the
new
year
and
then
he
will
have
a
big
salary
and
lots
of
commissions
for
the
future
we
can
live
quite
differently
we
can
do
just
as
we
like
i
feel
so
relieved
and
so
happy
christine
it
will
be
splendid
to
have
heaps
of
money
and
not
need
to
have
any
anxiety
it
yes
anyhow
i
think
it
would
be
delightful
to
have
what
one
needs
no
not
only
what
one
needs
but
heaps
and
heaps
of
money
nora
nora
have
you
learnt
sense
yet
in
our
schooldays
you
were
a
great
spendthrift
yes
that
is
what
torvald
says
now
her
finger
at
but
nora
nora
is
not
so
silly
as
you
think
we
have
not
been
in
a
position
for
me
to
waste
money
we
have
both
had
to
work
you
too
yes
odds
and
ends
needlework
embroidery
and
that
kind
of
thing
her
and
other
things
as
well
you
know
torvald
left
his
office
when
we
were
married
there
was
no
prospect
of
promotion
there
and
he
had
to
try
and
earn
more
than
before
but
during
the
first
year
he
overworked
himself
dreadfully
you
see
he
had
to
make
money
every
way
he
could
and
he
worked
early
and
late
but
he
could
stand
it
and
fell
dreadfully
ill
and
the
doctors
said
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
south
you
spent
a
whole
year
in
italy
did
you
yes
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
away
i
can
tell
you
it
was
just
after
ivar
was
born
but
naturally
we
had
to
go
it
was
a
wonderfully
beautiful
journey
and
it
saved
torvald
life
but
it
cost
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
christine
so
i
should
think
it
cost
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
that
a
lot
it
yes
and
in
emergencies
like
that
it
is
lucky
to
have
the
money
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
we
had
it
from
papa
oh
i
see
it
was
just
about
that
time
that
he
died
was
it
yes
and
just
think
of
it
i
could
go
and
nurse
him
i
was
expecting
little
ivar
birth
every
day
and
i
had
my
poor
sick
torvald
to
look
after
my
dear
kind
father
i
never
saw
him
again
christine
that
was
the
saddest
time
i
have
known
since
our
marriage
i
know
how
fond
you
were
of
him
and
then
you
went
off
to
italy
yes
you
see
we
had
money
then
and
the
doctors
insisted
on
our
going
so
we
started
a
month
later
and
your
husband
came
back
quite
well
as
sound
as
a
bell
but
the
doctor
what
doctor
i
thought
your
maid
said
the
gentleman
who
arrived
here
just
as
i
did
was
the
doctor
yes
that
was
doctor
rank
but
he
does
come
here
professionally
he
is
our
greatest
friend
and
comes
in
at
least
once
every
day
no
torvald
has
not
had
an
hour
illness
since
then
and
our
children
are
strong
and
healthy
and
so
am
i
up
and
claps
her
christine
christine
it
good
to
be
alive
and
happy
but
how
horrid
of
me
i
am
talking
of
nothing
but
my
own
affairs
on
a
stool
near
her
and
rests
her
arms
on
her
you
must
be
angry
with
me
tell
me
is
it
really
true
that
you
did
not
love
your
husband
why
did
you
marry
him
my
mother
was
alive
then
and
was
bedridden
and
helpless
and
i
had
to
provide
for
my
two
younger
brothers
so
i
did
not
think
i
was
justified
in
refusing
his
offer
no
perhaps
you
were
quite
right
he
was
rich
at
that
time
then
i
believe
he
was
quite
well
off
but
his
business
was
a
precarious
one
and
when
he
died
it
all
went
to
pieces
and
there
was
nothing
left
and
then
well
i
had
to
turn
my
hand
to
anything
i
could
find
first
a
small
shop
then
a
small
school
and
so
on
the
last
three
years
have
seemed
like
one
long
with
no
rest
now
it
is
at
an
end
nora
my
poor
mother
needs
me
no
more
for
she
is
gone
and
the
boys
do
not
need
me
either
they
have
got
situations
and
can
shift
for
themselves
what
a
relief
you
must
feel
it
no
indeed
i
only
feel
my
life
unspeakably
empty
no
one
to
live
for
any
more
up
that
is
why
i
could
not
stand
the
life
in
my
little
backwater
any
longer
i
hope
it
may
be
easier
here
to
find
something
which
will
busy
me
and
occupy
my
thoughts
if
only
i
could
have
the
good
luck
to
get
some
regular
work
office
work
of
some
kind
but
christine
that
is
so
frightfully
tiring
and
you
look
tired
out
now
you
had
far
better
go
away
to
some
to
the
i
have
no
father
to
give
me
money
for
a
journey
nora
oh
do
be
angry
with
me
up
to
it
is
you
that
must
not
be
angry
with
me
dear
the
worst
of
a
position
like
mine
is
that
it
makes
one
so
bitter
no
one
to
work
for
and
yet
obliged
to
be
always
on
the
for
chances
one
must
live
and
so
one
becomes
selfish
when
you
told
me
of
the
happy
turn
your
fortunes
have
taken
you
will
hardly
believe
it
i
was
delighted
not
so
much
on
your
account
as
on
my
own
how
do
you
mean
oh
i
understand
you
mean
that
perhaps
torvald
could
get
you
something
to
do
yes
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
he
must
christine
just
leave
it
to
me
i
will
broach
the
subject
very
cleverly
i
will
think
of
something
that
will
please
him
very
much
it
will
make
me
so
happy
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
how
kind
you
are
nora
to
be
so
anxious
to
help
me
it
is
doubly
kind
in
you
for
you
know
so
little
of
the
burdens
and
troubles
of
life
i
i
know
so
little
of
them
my
dear
small
household
cares
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
are
a
child
nora
her
head
and
crosses
the
you
ought
not
to
be
so
superior
no
you
are
just
like
all
the
others
they
all
think
that
i
am
incapable
of
anything
really
serious
come
come
that
i
have
gone
through
nothing
in
this
world
of
cares
but
my
dear
nora
you
have
just
told
me
all
your
troubles
pooh
those
were
trifles
her
i
have
not
told
you
the
important
thing
the
important
thing
what
do
you
mean
you
look
down
upon
me
altogether
christine
but
you
ought
not
to
you
are
proud
are
you
of
so
hard
and
so
long
for
your
mother
indeed
i
do
look
down
on
any
one
but
it
is
true
that
i
am
both
proud
and
glad
to
think
that
i
was
privileged
to
make
the
end
of
my
mother
life
almost
free
from
care
and
you
are
proud
to
think
of
what
you
have
done
for
your
brothers
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
be
i
think
so
too
but
now
listen
to
this
i
too
have
something
to
be
proud
and
glad
of
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
but
what
do
you
refer
to
speak
low
suppose
torvald
were
to
hear
he
must
on
any
account
no
one
in
the
world
must
know
christine
except
you
but
what
is
it
come
here
her
down
on
the
sofa
beside
now
i
will
show
you
that
i
too
have
something
to
be
proud
and
glad
of
it
was
i
who
saved
torvald
life
saved
how
i
told
you
about
our
trip
to
italy
torvald
would
never
have
recovered
if
he
had
not
gone
there
yes
but
your
father
gave
you
the
necessary
funds
yes
that
is
what
torvald
and
all
the
others
think
but
papa
did
give
us
a
shilling
it
was
i
who
procured
the
money
you
all
that
large
sum
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
what
do
you
think
of
that
but
nora
how
could
you
possibly
do
it
did
you
win
a
prize
in
the
lottery
in
the
lottery
there
would
have
been
no
credit
in
that
but
where
did
you
get
it
from
then
and
smiling
with
an
air
of
hm
hu
aha
because
you
could
have
borrowed
it
could
i
why
not
no
a
wife
can
not
borrow
without
her
husband
consent
her
oh
if
it
is
a
wife
who
has
any
head
for
business
a
wife
who
has
the
wit
to
be
a
little
bit
clever
i
do
understand
it
at
all
nora
there
is
no
need
you
should
i
never
said
i
had
borrowed
the
money
i
may
have
got
it
some
other
way
back
on
the
perhaps
i
got
it
from
some
other
admirer
when
anyone
is
as
attractive
as
i
am
you
are
a
mad
creature
now
you
know
you
full
of
curiosity
christine
listen
to
me
nora
dear
have
you
been
a
little
bit
imprudent
up
is
it
imprudent
to
save
your
life
it
seems
to
me
imprudent
without
his
knowledge
to
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
not
know
my
goodness
ca
you
understand
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
have
no
idea
what
a
dangerous
condition
he
was
in
it
was
to
me
that
the
doctors
came
and
said
that
his
life
was
in
danger
and
that
the
only
thing
to
save
him
was
to
live
in
the
south
do
you
suppose
i
did
try
first
of
all
to
get
what
i
wanted
as
if
it
were
for
myself
i
told
him
how
much
i
should
love
to
travel
abroad
like
other
young
wives
i
tried
tears
and
entreaties
with
him
i
told
him
that
he
ought
to
remember
the
condition
i
was
in
and
that
he
ought
to
be
kind
and
indulgent
to
me
i
even
hinted
that
he
might
raise
a
loan
that
nearly
made
him
angry
christine
he
said
i
was
thoughtless
and
that
it
was
his
duty
as
my
husband
not
to
indulge
me
in
my
whims
and
caprices
as
i
believe
he
called
them
very
well
i
thought
you
must
be
saved
and
that
was
how
i
came
to
devise
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
did
your
husband
never
get
to
know
from
your
father
that
the
money
had
not
come
from
him
no
never
papa
died
just
at
that
time
i
had
meant
to
let
him
into
the
secret
and
beg
him
never
to
reveal
it
but
he
was
so
ill
then
alas
there
never
was
any
need
to
tell
him
and
since
then
have
you
never
told
your
secret
to
your
husband
good
heavens
no
how
could
you
think
so
a
man
who
has
such
strong
opinions
about
these
things
and
besides
how
painful
and
humiliating
it
would
be
for
torvald
with
his
manly
independence
to
know
that
he
owed
me
anything
it
would
upset
our
mutual
relations
altogether
our
beautiful
happy
home
would
no
longer
be
what
it
is
now
do
you
mean
never
to
tell
him
about
it
and
with
a
half
yes
some
day
perhaps
after
many
years
when
i
am
no
longer
as
as
i
am
now
do
laugh
at
me
i
mean
of
course
when
torvald
is
no
longer
as
devoted
to
me
as
he
is
now
when
my
dancing
and
and
reciting
have
palled
on
him
then
it
may
be
a
good
thing
to
have
something
in
reserve
off
what
nonsense
that
time
will
never
come
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
great
secret
christine
do
you
still
think
i
am
of
no
use
i
can
tell
you
too
that
this
affair
has
caused
me
a
lot
of
worry
it
has
been
by
no
means
easy
for
me
to
meet
my
engagements
punctually
i
may
tell
you
that
there
is
something
that
is
called
in
business
quarterly
interest
and
another
thing
called
payment
in
instalments
and
it
is
always
so
dreadfully
difficult
to
manage
them
i
have
had
to
save
a
little
here
and
there
where
i
could
you
understand
i
have
not
been
able
to
put
aside
much
from
my
housekeeping
money
for
torvald
must
have
a
good
table
i
could
let
my
children
be
shabbily
dressed
i
have
felt
obliged
to
use
up
all
he
gave
me
for
them
the
sweet
little
darlings
so
it
has
all
had
to
come
out
of
your
own
necessaries
of
life
poor
nora
of
course
besides
i
was
the
one
responsible
for
it
whenever
torvald
has
given
me
money
for
new
dresses
and
such
things
i
have
never
spent
more
than
half
of
it
i
have
always
bought
the
simplest
and
cheapest
things
thank
heaven
any
clothes
look
well
on
me
and
so
torvald
has
never
noticed
it
but
it
was
often
very
hard
on
me
christine
because
it
is
delightful
to
be
really
well
dressed
is
it
quite
so
well
then
i
have
found
other
ways
of
earning
money
last
winter
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
lot
of
copying
to
do
so
i
locked
myself
up
and
sat
writing
every
evening
until
quite
late
at
night
many
a
time
i
was
desperately
tired
but
all
the
same
it
was
a
tremendous
pleasure
to
sit
there
working
and
earning
money
it
was
like
being
a
man
how
much
have
you
been
able
to
pay
off
in
that
way
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
you
see
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
an
account
of
a
business
matter
of
that
kind
i
only
know
that
i
have
paid
every
penny
that
i
could
scrape
together
many
a
time
i
was
at
my
wits
end
then
i
used
to
sit
here
and
imagine
that
a
rich
old
gentleman
had
fallen
in
love
with
me
what
who
was
it
be
quiet
that
he
had
died
and
that
when
his
will
was
opened
it
contained
written
in
big
letters
the
instruction
the
lovely
nora
helmer
is
to
have
all
i
possess
paid
over
to
her
at
once
in
cash
but
my
dear
nora
who
could
the
man
be
good
gracious
ca
you
understand
there
was
no
old
gentleman
at
all
it
was
only
something
that
i
used
to
sit
here
and
imagine
when
i
could
think
of
any
way
of
procuring
money
but
it
all
the
same
now
the
tiresome
old
person
can
stay
where
he
is
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
do
care
about
him
or
his
will
either
for
i
am
free
from
care
now
my
goodness
it
delightful
to
think
of
christine
free
from
care
to
be
able
to
be
free
from
care
quite
free
from
care
to
be
able
to
play
and
romp
with
the
children
to
be
able
to
keep
the
house
beautifully
and
have
everything
just
as
torvald
likes
it
and
think
of
it
soon
the
spring
will
come
and
the
big
blue
sky
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
take
a
little
trip
perhaps
i
shall
see
the
sea
again
oh
it
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
alive
and
be
happy
bell
is
heard
in
the
there
is
the
bell
perhaps
i
had
better
go
no
do
go
no
one
will
come
in
here
it
is
sure
to
be
for
torvald
the
hall
excuse
me
there
is
a
gentleman
to
see
the
master
and
as
the
doctor
is
with
him
who
is
it
the
it
is
i
helmer
linde
trembles
and
turns
to
the
a
step
towards
him
and
speaks
in
a
strained
low
you
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
to
see
my
husband
about
bank
business
in
a
way
i
have
a
small
post
in
the
bank
and
i
hear
your
husband
is
to
be
our
chief
now
then
it
is
nothing
but
dry
business
matters
helmers
absolutely
nothing
else
be
so
good
as
to
go
into
the
study
then
bows
indifferently
to
him
and
shuts
the
door
into
the
hall
then
comes
back
and
makes
up
the
fire
in
the
nora
who
was
that
man
a
lawyer
of
the
name
of
krogstad
then
it
really
was
he
do
you
know
the
man
i
used
to
many
years
ago
at
one
time
he
was
a
solicitor
clerk
in
our
town
yes
he
was
he
is
greatly
altered
he
made
a
very
unhappy
marriage
he
is
a
widower
now
is
he
with
several
children
there
now
it
is
burning
up
the
door
of
the
stove
and
moves
the
they
say
he
carries
on
various
kinds
of
business
really
perhaps
he
does
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
do
let
us
think
of
business
it
is
so
tiresome
out
helmer
before
he
shuts
the
door
he
calls
to
no
my
dear
fellow
i
wo
disturb
you
i
would
rather
go
in
to
your
wife
for
a
little
while
the
door
and
mrs
linde
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
afraid
i
am
disturbing
you
too
no
not
at
all
doctor
rank
linde
i
have
often
heard
linde
name
mentioned
here
i
think
i
passed
you
on
the
stairs
when
i
arrived
linde
yes
i
go
up
very
slowly
i
ca
manage
stairs
well
ah
some
slight
internal
weakness
no
the
fact
is
i
have
been
overworking
myself
nothing
more
than
that
then
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
town
to
amuse
yourself
with
our
entertainments
i
have
come
to
look
for
work
is
that
a
good
cure
for
overwork
one
must
live
doctor
rank
yes
the
general
opinion
seems
to
be
that
it
is
necessary
look
here
doctor
rank
you
know
you
want
to
live
certainly
however
wretched
i
may
feel
i
want
to
prolong
the
agony
as
long
as
possible
all
my
patients
are
like
that
and
so
are
those
who
are
morally
diseased
one
of
them
and
a
bad
case
too
is
at
this
very
moment
with
helmer
ah
whom
do
you
mean
a
lawyer
of
the
name
of
krogstad
a
fellow
you
do
know
at
all
he
suffers
from
a
diseased
moral
character
helmer
but
even
he
began
talking
of
its
being
highly
important
that
he
should
live
did
he
what
did
he
want
to
speak
to
torvald
about
i
have
no
idea
i
only
heard
that
it
was
something
about
the
bank
i
did
know
this
what
his
name
krogstad
had
anything
to
do
with
the
bank
yes
he
has
some
sort
of
appointment
there
mrs
linde
i
do
know
whether
you
find
also
in
your
part
of
the
world
that
there
are
certain
people
who
go
zealously
snuffing
about
to
smell
out
moral
corruption
and
as
soon
as
they
have
found
some
put
the
person
concerned
into
some
lucrative
position
where
they
can
keep
their
eye
on
him
healthy
natures
are
left
out
in
the
cold
still
i
think
the
sick
are
those
who
most
need
taking
care
of
his
yes
there
you
are
that
is
the
sentiment
that
is
turning
society
into
a
nora
has
been
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
breaks
out

cloth
and
find
her
shouts
of
laughter
she
crawls
forward
and
pretends
to
frighten

fresh
laughter
meanwhile
there
has
been
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
but
none
of
them

noticed
it
the
door

half
opened
and
krogstad
appears
he
waits

little
the
game
goes
excuse
me
helmer
a
stifled
cry
turns
round
and
gets
up
on
to
her
ah
what
do
you
want
excuse
me
the
outer
door
was
ajar
i
suppose
someone
forgot
to
shut
it
my
husband
is
out
krogstad
i
know
that
what
do
you
want
here
then
a
word
with
you
with
me
the
children
go

we

game
takes
the
children
into
the
room
on

and
shuts

after
you

me
yes
i
do
today
it
is
not
the
first
of
the
month
yet
no
it
is
christmas
eve
and
it
will
depend
on
yourself
what
sort
of
a
christmas
you
will
spend
what
do
you
want
today
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
me
we
wo
talk
about
that
till
later
on
this
is
something
different
i
presume
you
can
give
me
a
moment
yes
yes
i
can
although
good
i
was
in
olsen
restaurant
and
saw
your
husband
going
down
the
street
yes
with
a
lady
what
then
may
i
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
if
it
was
a
linde
it
was
just
arrived
in
town
yes
today
she
is
a
great
friend
of
yours
is
she
she
is
but
i
do
see
i
knew
her
too
once
upon
a
time
i
am
aware
of
that
are
you
so
you
know
all
about
it
i
thought
as
much
then
i
can
ask
you
without
beating
about
the
bush
is
linde
to
have
an
appointment
in
the
bank
what
right
have
you
to
question
me
mr
krogstad
you
one
of
my
husband
subordinates
but
since
you
ask
you
shall
know
yes
linde
to
have
an
appointment
and
it
was
i
who
pleaded
her
cause
krogstad
let
me
tell
you
that
i
was
right
in
what
i
thought
then
up
and
down
the
sometimes
one
has
a
tiny
little
bit
of
influence
i
should
hope
because
one
is
a
woman
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
when
anyone
is
in
a
subordinate
position
krogstad
they
should
really
be
careful
to
avoid
offending
anyone
who
who
who
has
influence
exactly
his
helmer
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
use
your
influence
on
my
behalf
what
what
do
you
mean
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
see
that
i
am
allowed
to
keep
my
subordinate
position
in
the
bank
what
do
you
mean
by
that
who
proposes
to
take
your
post
away
from
you
oh
there
is
no
necessity
to
keep
up
the
pretence
of
ignorance
i
can
quite
understand
that
your
friend
is
not
very
anxious
to
expose
herself
to
the
chance
of
rubbing
shoulders
with
me
and
i
quite
understand
too
whom
i
have
to
thank
for
being
turned
off
but
i
assure
you
very
likely
but
to
come
to
the
point
the
time
has
come
when
i
should
advise
you
to
use
your
influence
to
prevent
that
but
krogstad
i
no
influence
have
you
i
thought
you
said
yourself
just
now
naturally
i
did
not
mean
you
to
put
that
construction
on
it
i
what
should
make
you
think
i
have
any
influence
of
that
kind
with
my
husband
oh
i
have
known
your
husband
from
our
student
days
i
suppose
he
is
any
more
unassailable
than
other
husbands
if
you
speak
slightly
of
my
husband
i
shall
turn
you
out
of
the
house
you
are
bold
helmer
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
any
longer
as
soon
as
the
new
year
comes
i
shall
in
a
very
short
time
be
free
of
the
whole
thing
listen
to
me
helmer
if
necessary
i
am
prepared
to
fight
for
my
small
post
in
the
bank
as
if
i
were
fighting
for
my
life
so
it
seems
it
is
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
money
indeed
that
weighs
least
with
me
in
the
matter
there
is
another
reason
well
i
may
as
well
tell
you
my
position
is
this
i
daresay
you
know
like
everybody
else
that
once
many
years
ago
i
was
guilty
of
an
indiscretion
i
think
i
have
heard
something
of
the
kind
the
matter
never
came
into
court
but
every
way
seemed
to
be
closed
to
me
after
that
so
i
took
to
the
business
that
you
know
of
i
had
to
do
something
and
honestly
do
think
i
been
one
of
the
worst
but
now
i
must
cut
myself
free
from
all
that
my
sons
are
growing
up
for
their
sake
i
must
try
and
win
back
as
much
respect
as
i
can
in
the
town
this
post
in
the
bank
was
like
the
first
step
up
for
me
and
now
your
husband
is
going
to
kick
me
downstairs
again
into
the
mud
but
you
must
believe
me
krogstad
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
help
you
at
all
then
it
is
because
you
have
the
will
but
i
have
means
to
compel
you
you
do
mean
that
you
will
tell
my
husband
that
i
owe
you
money
hm
suppose
i
were
to
tell
him
it
would
be
perfectly
infamous
of
you
to
think
of
his
learning
my
secret
which
has
been
my
joy
and
pride
in
such
an
ugly
clumsy
way
that
he
should
learn
it
from
you
and
it
would
put
me
in
a
horribly
disagreeable
position
only
disagreeable
well
do
it
then
and
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
my
husband
will
see
for
himself
what
a
blackguard
you
are
and
you
certainly
wo
keep
your
post
then
i
asked
you
if
it
was
only
a
disagreeable
scene
at
home
that
you
were
afraid
of
if
my
husband
does
get
to
know
of
it
of
course
he
will
at
once
pay
you
what
is
still
owing
and
we
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
a
step
listen
to
me
helmer
either
you
have
a
very
bad
memory
or
you
know
very
little
of
business
i
shall
be
obliged
to
remind
you
of
a
few
details
what
do
you
mean
when
your
husband
was
ill
you
came
to
me
to
borrow
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
i
did
know
any
one
else
to
go
to
i
promised
to
get
you
that
amount
yes
and
you
did
so
i
promised
to
get
you
that
amount
on
certain
conditions
your
mind
was
so
taken
up
with
your
husband
illness
and
you
were
so
anxious
to
get
the
money
for
your
journey
that
you
seem
to
have
paid
no
attention
to
the
conditions
of
our
bargain
therefore
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
i
remind
you
of
them
now
i
promised
to
get
the
money
on
the
security
of
a
bond
which
i
drew
up
yes
and
which
i
signed
good
but
below
your
signature
there
were
a
few
lines
constituting
your
father
a
surety
for
the
money
those
lines
your
father
should
have
signed
should
he
did
sign
them
i
had
left
the
date
blank
that
is
to
say
your
father
should
himself
have
inserted
the
date
on
which
he
signed
the
paper
do
you
remember
that
yes
i
think
i
remember
then
i
gave
you
the
bond
to
send
by
post
to
your
father
is
that
not
so
yes
and
you
naturally
did
so
at
once
because
five
or
six
days
afterwards
you
brought
me
the
bond
with
your
father
signature
and
then
i
gave
you
the
money
well
have
i
been
paying
it
off
regularly
fairly
so
yes
but
to
come
back
to
the
matter
in
hand
that
must
have
been
a
very
trying
time
for
you
helmer
it
was
indeed
your
father
was
very
ill
was
he
he
was
very
near
his
end
and
died
soon
afterwards
yes
tell
me
helmer
can
you
by
any
chance
remember
what
day
your
father
died
on
what
day
of
the
month
i
mean
papa
died
on
the
of
september
that
is
correct
i
have
ascertained
it
for
myself
and
as
that
is
so
there
is
a
discrepancy
a
paper
from
his
which
i
can
not
account
for
what
discrepancy
i
do
know
the
discrepancy
consists
helmer
in
the
fact
that
your
father
signed
this
bond
three
days
after
his
death
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
your
father
died
on
the
of
september
but
look
here
your
father
dated
his
signature
the
of
october
it
is
a
discrepancy
is
it
nora
can
you
explain
it
to
me
nora
still
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
too
that
the
words
of
october
as
well
as
the
year
are
not
written
in
your
handwriting
but
in
one
that
i
think
i
know
well
of
course
it
can
be
explained
your
father
may
have
forgotten
to
date
his
signature
and
someone
else
may
have
dated
it
haphazard
before
they
knew
of
his
death
there
is
no
harm
in
that
it
all
depends
on
the
signature
of
the
name
and
is
genuine
i
suppose
helmer
it
was
your
father
himself
who
signed
his
name
here
a
short
pause
throws
her
head
up
and
looks
defiantly
at
no
it
was
not
it
was
i
that
wrote
papa
name
are
you
aware
that
is
a
dangerous
confession
in
what
way
you
shall
have
your
money
soon
let
me
ask
you
a
question
why
did
you
not
send
the
paper
to
your
father
it
was
impossible
papa
was
so
ill
if
i
had
asked
him
for
his
signature
i
should
have
had
to
tell
him
what
the
money
was
to
be
used
for
and
when
he
was
so
ill
himself
i
could
tell
him
that
my
husband
life
was
in
danger
it
was
impossible
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
if
you
had
given
up
your
trip
abroad
no
that
was
impossible
that
trip
was
to
save
my
life
i
could
give
that
up
but
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
you
were
committing
a
fraud
on
me
i
could
take
that
into
account
i
did
trouble
myself
about
you
at
all
i
could
bear
you
because
you
put
so
many
heartless
difficulties
in
my
way
although
you
knew
what
a
dangerous
condition
my
husband
was
in
helmer
you
evidently
do
not
realise
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
but
i
can
assure
you
that
my
one
false
step
which
lost
me
all
my
reputation
was
nothing
more
or
nothing
worse
than
what
you
have
done
you
do
you
ask
me
to
believe
that
you
were
brave
enough
to
run
a
risk
to
save
your
wife
life
the
law
cares
nothing
about
motives
then
it
must
be
a
very
foolish
law
foolish
or
not
it
is
the
law
by
which
you
will
be
judged
if
i
produce
this
paper
in
court
i
do
believe
it
is
a
daughter
not
to
be
allowed
to
spare
her
dying
father
anxiety
and
care
is
a
wife
not
to
be
allowed
to
save
her
husband
life
i
do
know
much
about
law
but
i
am
certain
that
there
must
be
laws
permitting
such
things
as
that
have
you
no
knowledge
of
such
laws
you
who
are
a
lawyer
you
must
be
a
very
poor
lawyer
krogstad
maybe
but
matters
of
business
such
business
as
you
and
i
have
had
together
do
you
think
i
do
understand
that
very
well
do
as
you
please
but
let
me
tell
you
this
if
i
lose
my
position
a
second
time
you
shall
lose
yours
with
me
bows
and
goes
out
through
the
buried
in
thought
for
a
short
time
then
tosses
her
head
nonsense
trying
to
frighten
me
like
that
i
am
not
so
silly
as
he
thinks
to
busy
herself
putting
the
children
things
in
and
yet
no
it
impossible
i
did
it
for
love
sake
the
doorway
on
the
left
mother
the
stranger
man
has
gone
out
through
the
gate
yes
dears
i
know
but
do
tell
anyone
about
the
stranger
man
do
you
hear
not
even
papa
no
mother
but
will
you
come
and
play
again
no
no
not
now
but
mother
you
promised
us
yes
but
i
ca
now
run
away
in
i
have
such
a
lot
to
do
run
away
in
sweet
little
darlings
gets
them
into
the
room
by
degrees
and
shuts
the
door
on
them
then
sits
down
on
the
sofa
takes
up
a
piece
of
needlework
and
sews
a
few
stitches
but
soon
no
down
the
work
gets
up
goes
to
the
hall
door
and
calls
helen
bring
the
tree
in
to
the
table
on
the
left
opens
a
drawer
and
stops
no
no
it
is
quite
impossible
in
with
the
where
shall
i
put
it
here
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
shall
i
get
you
anything
else
no
thank
you
i
have
all
i
want
maid
dressing
the
a
candle
here
and
flowers

horrible
man

all
nonsense

wrong

tree

be
splendid
i
will
do
everything
i
can
think
of
to
please
you
torvald
i
will
sing
for
you
dance
for
you
helmer
in
with
some
papers
under
his
oh
are
you
back
already
yes
has
anyone
been
here
here
no
that
is
strange
i
saw
krogstad
going
out
of
the
gate
did
you
oh
yes
i
forgot
krogstad
was
here
for
a
moment
nora
i
can
see
from
your
manner
that
he
has
been
here
begging
you
to
say
a
good
word
for
him
yes
and
you
were
to
appear
to
do
it
of
your
own
accord
you
were
to
conceal
from
me
the
fact
of
his
having
been
here
did
he
beg
that
of
you
too
yes
torvald
but
nora
nora
and
you
would
be
a
party
to
that
sort
of
thing
to
have
any
talk
with
a
man
like
that
and
give
him
any
sort
of
promise
and
to
tell
me
a
lie
into
the
bargain
a
lie
did
you
tell
me
no
one
had
been
here
his
finger
at
my
little
must
never
do
that
again
a
must
have
a
clean
beak
to
chirp
with
no
false
notes
his
arm
round
her
that
is
so
is
it
yes
i
am
sure
it
is
her
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
down
by
the
how
warm
and
snug
it
is
here
over
his
a
short
pause
during
which
she
busies
herself
with
the
christmas
torvald
yes
i
am
looking
forward
tremendously
to
the
fancy
dress
ball
at
the
stensborgs
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
i
am
tremendously
curious
to
see
what
you
are
going
to
surprise
me
with
it
was
very
silly
of
me
to
want
to
do
that
what
do
you
mean
i
ca
hit
upon
anything
that
will
do
everything
i
think
of
seems
so
silly
and
insignificant
does
my
little
nora
acknowledge
that
at
last
behind
his
chair
with
her
arms
on
the
back
of
are
you
very
busy
torvald
well
what
are
all
those
papers
bank
business
already
i
have
got
authority
from
the
retiring
manager
to
undertake
the
necessary
changes
in
the
staff
and
in
the
rearrangement
of
the
work
and
i
must
make
use
of
the
christmas
week
for
that
so
as
to
have
everything
in
order
for
the
new
year
then
that
was
why
this
poor
krogstad
hm
against
the
back
of
his
chair
and
strokes
his
if
you
had
been
so
busy
i
should
have
asked
you
a
tremendously
big
favour
torvald
what
is
that
tell
me
there
is
no
one
has
such
good
taste
as
you
and
i
do
so
want
to
look
nice
at
the
ball
torvald
could
you
take
me
in
hand
and
decide
what
i
shall
go
as
and
what
sort
of
a
dress
i
shall
wear
aha
so
my
obstinate
little
woman
is
obliged
to
get
someone
to
come
to
her
rescue
yes
torvald
i
ca
get
along
a
bit
without
your
help
very
well
i
will
think
it
over
we
shall
manage
to
hit
upon
something
that
nice
of
you
to
the
christmas
tree
a
short
pause
how
pretty
the
red
flowers
look
but
tell
me
was
it
really
something
very
bad
that
this
krogstad
was
guilty
of
he
forged
someone
name
have
you
any
idea
what
that
means
is
it
possible
that
he
was
driven
to
do
it
by
necessity
yes
or
as
in
so
many
cases
by
imprudence
i
am
not
so
heartless
as
to
condemn
a
man
altogether
because
of
a
single
false
step
of
that
kind
no
you
would
would
you
torvald
many
a
man
has
been
able
to
retrieve
his
character
if
he
has
openly
confessed
his
fault
and
taken
his
punishment
punishment
but
krogstad
did
nothing
of
that
sort
he
got
himself
out
of
it
by
a
cunning
trick
and
that
is
why
he
has
gone
under
altogether
but
do
you
think
it
would
just
think
how
a
guilty
man
like
that
has
to
lie
and
play
the
hypocrite
with
everyone
how
he
has
to
wear
a
mask
in
the
presence
of
those
near
and
dear
to
him
even
before
his
own
wife
and
children
and
about
the
children
that
is
the
most
terrible
part
of
it
all
nora
how
because
such
an
atmosphere
of
lies
infects
and
poisons
the
whole
life
of
a
home
each
breath
the
children
take
in
such
a
house
is
full
of
the
germs
of
evil
nearer
are
you
sure
of
that
my
dear
i
have
often
seen
it
in
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
lawyer
almost
everyone
who
has
gone
to
the
bad
early
in
life
has
had
a
deceitful
mother
why
do
you
only
say
mother
it
seems
most
commonly
to
be
the
mother
influence
though
naturally
a
bad
father
would
have
the
same
result
every
lawyer
is
familiar
with
the
fact
this
krogstad
now
has
been
persistently
poisoning
his
own
children
with
lies
and
dissimulation
that
is
why
i
say
he
has
lost
all
moral
character
out
his
hands
to
her
that
is
why
my
sweet
little
nora
must
promise
me
not
to
plead
his
cause
give
me
your
hand
on
it
come
come
what
is
this
give
me
your
hand
there
now
that
settled
i
assure
you
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
work
with
him
i
literally
feel
physically
ill
when
i
am
in
the
company
of
such
people
her
hand
out
of
his
and
goes
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
christmas
how
hot
it
is
in
here
and
i
have
such
a
lot
to
do
up
and
putting
his
papers
in
yes
and
i
must
try
and
read
through
some
of
these
before
dinner
and
i
must
think
about
your
costume
too
and
it
is
just
possible
i
may
have
something
ready
in
gold
paper
to
hang
up
on
the
tree
his
hand
on
her
head
my
precious
little
goes
into
his
room
and
shuts
the
door
after
him
a
pause
no
no
it
is
true
impossible
it
must
be
impossible
nurse
the
door
on
the
the
little
ones
are
begging
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
come
in
to
mamma
no
no
no
do
let
them
come
in
to
me
you
stay
with
them
anne
very
well
the
with
deprave
my
little
children
poison
my
home
short
pause
then
she
tosses
her
it
not
true
it
possibly
be
true
act
ii
the
same
scene
christmas
tree
is
in
the
corner
by
the
piano
stripped
of
its
ornaments
and
with
on
its
dishevelled
nora
and
hat
are
lying
on
the
sofa
she
is
alone
in
the
room
walking
about
uneasily
she
stops
by
the
sofa
and
takes
up
her
the
someone
is
coming
now
to
the
door
and
no
it
is
no
one
of
course
no
one
will
come
today
christmas
day
nor
tomorrow
either
but
perhaps
the
door
and
looks
no
nothing
in
the
it
is
quite
empty
what
rubbish
of
course
he
ca
be
in
earnest
about
it
such
a
thing
could
happen
it
is
impossible
i
have
three
little
children
nurse
the
room
on
the
left
carrying
a
big
cardboard
at
last
i
have
found
the
box
with
the
fancy
dress
thanks
put
it
on
the
table
but
it
is
very
much
in
want
of
mending
i
should
like
to
tear
it
into
a
hundred
thousand
pieces
what
an
idea
it
can
easily
be
put
in
order
just
a
little
patience
yes
i
will
go
and
get
linde
to
come
and
help
me
with
it
what
out
again
in
this
horrible
weather
you
will
catch
cold
and
make
yourself
well
worse
than
that
might
happen
how
are
the
children
the
poor
little
souls
are
playing
with
their
christmas
presents
but
do
they
ask
much
for
me
you
see
they
are
so
accustomed
to
have
their
mamma
with
them
yes
but
nurse
i
shall
not
be
able
to
be
so
much
with
them
now
as
i
was
before
oh
well
young
children
easily
get
accustomed
to
anything
do
you
think
so
do
you
think
they
would
forget
their
mother
if
she
went
away
altogether
good
heavens
went
away
altogether
nurse
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
i
have
often
wondered
about
how
could
you
have
the
heart
to
put
your
own
child
out
among
strangers
i
was
obliged
to
if
i
wanted
to
be
little
nora
nurse
yes
but
how
could
you
be
willing
to
do
it
what
when
i
was
going
to
get
such
a
good
place
by
it
a
poor
girl
who
has
got
into
trouble
should
be
glad
to
besides
that
wicked
man
did
do
a
single
thing
for
me
but
i
suppose
your
daughter
has
quite
forgotten
you
no
indeed
she
has
she
wrote
to
me
when
she
was
confirmed
and
when
she
was
married
her
arms
round
her
dear
old
anne
you
were
a
good
mother
to
me
when
i
was
little
little
nora
poor
dear
had
no
other
mother
but
me
and
if
my
little
ones
had
no
other
mother
i
am
sure
you
would
what
nonsense
i
am
talking
the
go
in
to
them
now
i
must
you
will
see
tomorrow
how
charming
i
shall
look
i
am
sure
there
will
be
no
one
at
the
ball
so
charming
as
you
into
the
room
on
the
to
unpack
the
box
but
soon
pushes
it
away
from
if
only
i
dared
go
out
if
only
no
one
would
come
if
only
i
could
be
sure
nothing
would
happen
here
in
the
meantime
stuff
and
nonsense
no
one
will
come
only
i
must
think
about
it
i
will
brush
my
muff
what
lovely
lovely
gloves
out
of
my
thoughts
out
of
my
thoughts
one
two
three
four
five
six
ah
there
is
someone
coming
a
movement
towards
the
door
but
stands
linde
the
hall
where
she
has
taken
off
her
cloak
and
oh
it
you
christine
there
is
no
one
else
out
there
is
there
how
good
of
you
to
come
i
heard
you
were
up
asking
for
me
yes
i
was
passing
by
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
something
you
could
help
me
with
let
us
sit
down
here
on
the
sofa
look
here
tomorrow
evening
there
is
to
be
a
ball
at
the
stenborgs
who
live
above
us
and
torvald
wants
me
to
go
as
a
neapolitan
and
dance
the
tarantella
that
i
learnt
at
capri
i
see
you
are
going
to
keep
up
the
character
yes
torvald
wants
me
to
look
here
is
the
dress
torvald
had
it
made
for
me
there
but
now
it
is
all
so
torn
and
i
have
any
idea
we
will
easily
put
that
right
it
is
only
some
of
the
trimming
come
unsewn
here
and
there
needle
and
thread
now
then
all
we
want
it
nice
of
you
so
you
are
going
to
be
dressed
up
tomorrow
nora
i
will
tell
you
what
i
shall
come
in
for
a
moment
and
see
you
in
your
fine
feathers
but
i
have
completely
forgotten
to
thank
you
for
a
delightful
evening
yesterday
up
and
crosses
the
well
i
do
think
yesterday
was
as
pleasant
as
usual
you
ought
to
have
come
to
town
a
little
earlier
christine
certainly
torvald
does
understand
how
to
make
a
house
dainty
and
attractive
and
so
do
you
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
your
daughter
for
nothing
but
tell
me
is
doctor
rank
always
as
depressed
as
he
was
yesterday
no
yesterday
it
was
very
noticeable
i
must
tell
you
that
he
suffers
from
a
dangerous
disease
he
has
consumption
of
the
spine
poor
creature
his
father
was
a
horrible
man
who
committed
all
sorts
of
excesses
and
that
is
why
his
son
was
sickly
from
childhood
do
you
understand
her
but
my
dearest
nora
how
do
you
know
anything
about
such
things
pooh
when
you
have
three
children
you
get
visits
now
and
then
from
from
married
women
who
know
something
of
medical
matters
and
they
talk
about
one
thing
and
another
on
sewing
a
short
does
doctor
rank
come
here
every
day
every
day
regularly
he
is
torvald
most
intimate
friend
and
a
great
friend
of
mine
too
he
is
just
like
one
of
the
family
but
tell
me
this
is
he
perfectly
sincere
i
mean
he
the
kind
of
a
man
that
is
very
anxious
to
make
himself
agreeable
not
in
the
least
what
makes
you
think
that
when
you
introduced
him
to
me
yesterday
he
declared
he
had
often
heard
my
name
mentioned
in
this
house
but
afterwards
i
noticed
that
your
husband
had
the
slightest
idea
who
i
was
so
how
could
doctor
rank
that
is
quite
right
christine
torvald
is
so
absurdly
fond
of
me
that
he
wants
me
absolutely
to
himself
as
he
says
at
first
he
used
to
seem
almost
jealous
if
i
mentioned
any
of
the
dear
folk
at
home
so
naturally
i
gave
up
doing
so
but
i
often
talk
about
such
things
with
doctor
rank
because
he
likes
hearing
about
them
listen
to
me
nora
you
are
still
very
like
a
child
in
many
ways
and
i
am
older
than
you
in
many
ways
and
have
a
little
more
experience
let
me
tell
you
this
you
ought
to
make
an
end
of
it
with
doctor
rank
what
ought
i
to
make
an
end
of
of
two
things
i
think
yesterday
you
talked
some
nonsense
about
a
rich
admirer
who
was
to
leave
you
money
an
admirer
who
does
exist
unfortunately
but
what
then
is
doctor
rank
a
man
of
means
yes
he
is
and
has
no
one
to
provide
for
no
no
one
but
and
comes
here
every
day
yes
i
told
you
so
but
how
can
this
man
be
so
tactless
i
do
understand
you
at
all
do
prevaricate
nora
do
you
suppose
i
do
guess
who
lent
you
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
are
you
out
of
your
senses
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
a
friend
of
ours
who
comes
here
every
day
do
you
realise
what
a
horribly
painful
position
that
would
be
then
it
really
is
he
no
certainly
not
it
would
never
have
entered
into
my
head
for
a
moment
besides
he
had
no
money
to
lend
then
he
came
into
his
money
afterwards
well
i
think
that
was
lucky
for
you
my
dear
nora
no
it
would
never
have
come
into
my
head
to
ask
doctor
rank
although
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
i
had
asked
him
but
of
course
you
wo
of
course
not
i
have
no
reason
to
think
it
could
possibly
be
necessary
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
i
told
doctor
rank
behind
your
husband
back
i
must
make
an
end
of
it
with
the
other
one
and
that
will
be
behind
his
back
too
i
make
an
end
of
it
with
him
yes
that
is
what
i
told
you
yesterday
but
up
and
a
man
can
put
a
thing
like
that
straight
much
easier
than
a
woman
one
husband
yes
nonsense
when
you
pay
off
a
debt
you
get
your
bond
back
do
you
yes
as
a
matter
of
course
and
can
tear
it
into
a
hundred
thousand
pieces
and
burn
it
up
the
nasty
dirty
paper
hard
at
her
lays
down
her
sewing
and
gets
up
nora
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
do
i
look
as
if
i
were
something
has
happened
to
you
since
yesterday
morning
nora
what
is
it
nearer
to
christine
hush
torvald
come
home
do
you
mind
going
in
to
the
children
for
the
present
torvald
ca
bear
to
see
dressmaking
going
on
let
anne
help
you
some
of
the
things
certainly
but
i
am
not
going
away
from
here
till
we
have
had
it
out
with
one
another
goes
into
the
room
on
the
left
as
helmer
comes
in
from
the
up
helmar
i
have
wanted
you
so
much
torvald
dear
was
that
the
dressmaker
no
it
was
christine
she
is
helping
me
to
put
my
dress
in
order
you
will
see
i
shall
look
quite
smart
was
that
a
happy
thought
of
mine
now
splendid
but
do
you
think
it
is
nice
of
me
too
to
do
as
you
wish
nice
because
you
do
as
your
husband
wishes
well
well
you
little
rogue
i
am
sure
you
did
not
mean
it
in
that
way
but
i
am
not
going
to
disturb
you
you
will
want
to
be
trying
on
your
dress
i
expect
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
work
yes
her
a
bundle
of
look
at
that
i
have
just
been
into
the
bank
to
go
into
his
torvald
yes
if
your
little
squirrel
were
to
ask
you
for
something
very
very
prettily
what
then
would
you
do
it
i
should
like
to
hear
what
it
is
first
your
squirrel
would
run
about
and
do
all
her
tricks
if
you
would
be
nice
and
do
what
she
wants
speak
plainly
your
skylark
would
chirp
about
in
every
room
with
her
song
rising
and
falling
well
my
skylark
does
that
anyhow
i
would
play
the
fairy
and
dance
for
you
in
the
moonlight
torvald
nora
you
surely
do
mean
that
request
you
made
of
me
this
morning
near
yes
torvald
i
beg
you
so
earnestly
have
you
really
the
courage
to
open
up
that
question
again
yes
dear
you
do
as
i
ask
you
let
krogstad
keep
his
post
in
the
bank
my
dear
nora
it
is
his
post
that
i
have
arranged
linde
shall
have
yes
you
have
been
awfully
kind
about
that
but
you
could
just
as
well
dismiss
some
other
clerk
instead
of
krogstad
this
is
simply
incredible
obstinacy
because
you
chose
to
give
him
a
thoughtless
promise
that
you
would
speak
for
him
i
am
expected
to
that
is
the
reason
torvald
it
is
for
your
own
sake
this
fellow
writes
in
the
most
scurrilous
newspapers
you
have
told
me
so
yourself
he
can
do
you
an
unspeakable
amount
of
harm
i
am
frightened
to
death
of
him
ah
i
understand
it
is
recollections
of
the
past
that
scare
you
what
do
you
mean
naturally
you
are
thinking
of
your
father
yes
yes
of
course
just
recall
to
your
mind
what
these
malicious
creatures
wrote
in
the
papers
about
papa
and
how
horribly
they
slandered
him
i
believe
they
would
have
procured
his
dismissal
if
the
department
had
not
sent
you
over
to
inquire
into
it
and
if
you
had
not
been
so
kindly
disposed
and
helpful
to
him
my
little
nora
there
is
an
important
difference
between
your
father
and
me
your
father
reputation
as
a
public
official
was
not
above
suspicion
mine
is
and
i
hope
it
will
continue
to
be
so
as
long
as
i
hold
my
office
you
never
can
tell
what
mischief
these
men
may
contrive
we
ought
to
be
so
well
off
so
snug
and
happy
here
in
our
peaceful
home
and
have
no
cares
you
and
i
and
the
children
torvald
that
is
why
i
beg
you
so
earnestly
and
it
is
just
by
interceding
for
him
that
you
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
keep
him
it
is
already
known
at
the
bank
that
i
mean
to
dismiss
krogstad
is
it
to
get
about
now
that
the
new
manager
has
changed
his
mind
at
his
wife
bidding
and
what
if
it
did
of
course
if
only
this
obstinate
little
person
can
get
her
way
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
make
myself
ridiculous
before
my
whole
staff
to
let
people
think
that
i
am
a
man
to
be
swayed
by
all
sorts
of
outside
influence
i
should
very
soon
feel
the
consequences
of
it
i
can
tell
you
and
besides
there
is
one
thing
that
makes
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
have
krogstad
in
the
bank
as
long
as
i
am
manager
whatever
is
that
his
moral
failings
i
might
perhaps
have
overlooked
if
necessary
yes
you
could
could
you
and
i
hear
he
is
a
good
worker
too
but
i
knew
him
when
we
were
boys
it
was
one
of
those
rash
friendships
that
so
often
prove
an
incubus
in
after
life
i
may
as
well
tell
you
plainly
we
were
once
on
very
intimate
terms
with
one
another
but
this
tactless
fellow
lays
no
restraint
upon
himself
when
other
people
are
present
on
the
contrary
he
thinks
it
gives
him
the
right
to
adopt
a
familiar
tone
with
me
and
every
minute
it
is
i
say
helmer
old
fellow
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
assure
you
it
is
extremely
painful
to
me
he
would
make
my
position
in
the
bank
intolerable
torvald
i
do
believe
you
mean
that
do
you
why
not
because
it
is
such
a
way
of
looking
at
things
what
are
you
saying
do
you
think
i
am
no
just
the
opposite
dear
and
it
is
exactly
for
that
reason
it
the
same
thing
you
say
my
point
of
view
is
so
i
must
be
so
too
very
well
i
must
put
an
end
to
this
to
the
hall
door
and
calls
helen
what
are
you
going
to
do
among
his
papers
settle
it
maid
look
here
take
this
letter
and
go
downstairs
with
it
at
once
find
a
messenger
and
tell
him
to
deliver
it
and
be
quick
the
address
is
on
it
and
here
is
the
money
very
well
sir
with
the
his
papers
now
then
little
miss
obstinate
torvald
what
was
that
letter
krogstad
dismissal
call
her
back
torvald
there
is
still
time
oh
torvald
call
her
back
do
it
for
my
sake
for
your
own
sake
for
the
children
sake
do
you
hear
me
torvald
call
her
back
you
do
know
what
that
letter
can
bring
upon
us
it
too
late
yes
it
too
late
my
dear
nora
i
can
forgive
the
anxiety
you
are
in
although
really
it
is
an
insult
to
me
it
is
indeed
is
it
an
insult
to
think
that
i
should
be
afraid
of
a
starving
vengeance
but
i
forgive
you
nevertheless
because
it
is
such
eloquent
witness
to
your
great
love
for
me
her
in
his
arms
and
that
is
as
it
should
be
my
own
darling
nora
come
what
will
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
have
both
courage
and
strength
if
they
be
needed
you
will
see
i
am
man
enough
to
take
everything
upon
myself
a
what
do
you
mean
by
that
everything
i
say
you
will
never
have
to
do
that
that
right
well
we
will
share
it
nora
as
man
and
wife
should
that
is
how
it
shall
be
are
you
content
now
there
there
not
these
frightened
dove
eyes
the
whole
thing
is
only
the
wildest
fancy
now
you
must
go
and
play
through
the
tarantella
and
practice
with
your
tambourine
i
shall
go
into
the
inner
office
and
shut
the
door
and
i
shall
hear
nothing
you
can
make
as
much
noise
as
you
please
back
at
the
door
and
when
rank
comes
tell
him
where
he
will
find
me
to
her
takes
his
papers
and
goes
into
his
room
and
shuts
the
door
after
with
anxiety
stands
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
and
he
was
capable
of
doing
it
he
will
do
it
he
will
do
it
in
spite
of
no
not
that
never
never
anything
rather
than
that
oh
for
some
help
some
way
out
of
it
doctor
rank
anything
rather
than
that
anything
whatever
it
is
puts
her
hands
over
her
face
pulls
herself
together
goes
to
the
door
and
opens
it
is
standing
without
hanging
up
his
coat
during
the
following
dialogue
it
begins
to
grow
doctor
rank
i
knew
your
ring
but
you
must
go
into
torvald
now
i
think
he
is
busy
with
something
and
you
him
in
and
shuts
the
door
after
oh
you
know
very
well
i
always
have
time
for
you
thank
you
i
shall
make
use
of
as
much
of
it
as
i
can
what
do
you
mean
by
that
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
well
does
that
alarm
you
it
was
such
a
strange
way
of
putting
it
is
anything
likely
to
happen
nothing
but
what
i
have
long
been
prepared
for
but
i
certainly
did
expect
it
to
happen
so
soon
him
by
the
what
have
you
found
out
doctor
rank
you
must
tell
me
down
by
the
it
is
all
up
with
me
and
it
be
helped
a
sigh
of
is
it
about
yourself
who
else
it
is
no
use
lying
to
one
self
i
am
the
most
wretched
of
all
my
patients
helmer
lately
i
have
been
taking
stock
of
my
internal
economy
bankrupt
probably
within
a
month
i
shall
lie
rotting
in
the
what
an
ugly
thing
to
say
the
thing
itself
is
cursedly
ugly
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
shall
have
to
face
so
much
more
that
is
ugly
before
that
i
shall
only
make
one
more
examination
of
myself
when
i
have
done
that
i
shall
know
pretty
certainly
when
it
will
be
that
the
horrors
of
dissolution
will
begin
there
is
something
i
want
to
tell
you
helmer
refined
nature
gives
him
an
unconquerable
disgust
of
everything
that
is
ugly
i
have
him
in
my
oh
but
doctor
rank
i
wo
have
him
there
not
on
any
account
i
bar
my
door
to
him
as
soon
as
i
am
quite
certain
that
the
worst
has
come
i
shall
send
you
my
card
with
a
black
cross
on
it
and
then
you
will
know
that
the
loathsome
end
has
begun
you
are
quite
absurd
and
i
wanted
you
so
much
to
be
in
a
really
good
humour
with
death
stalking
beside
me
to
have
to
pay
this
penalty
for
another
man
sin
is
there
any
justice
in
that
and
in
every
single
family
in
one
way
or
another
some
such
inexorable
retribution
is
being
exacted
her
hands
over
her
rubbish
do
talk
of
something
cheerful
oh
it
a
mere
laughing
matter
the
whole
thing
my
poor
innocent
spine
has
to
suffer
for
my
father
youthful
amusements
at
the
table
on
the
i
suppose
you
mean
that
he
was
too
partial
to
asparagus
and
pate
de
foie
gras
do
you
yes
and
to
truffles
truffles
yes
and
oysters
too
i
suppose
oysters
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
and
heaps
of
port
and
champagne
it
is
sad
that
all
these
nice
things
should
take
their
revenge
on
our
bones
especially
that
they
should
revenge
themselves
on
the
unlucky
bones
of
those
who
have
not
had
the
satisfaction
of
enjoying
them
yes
that
the
saddest
part
of
it
all
a
searching
look
at
hm
a
short
why
did
you
smile
no
it
was
you
that
laughed
no
it
was
you
that
smiled
doctor
rank
you
are
a
greater
rascal
than
i
thought
i
am
in
a
silly
mood
today
so
it
seems
her
hands
on
his
dear
dear
doctor
rank
death
must
take
you
away
from
torvald
and
me
it
is
a
loss
you
would
easily
recover
from
those
who
are
gone
are
soon
forgotten
at
him
do
you
believe
that
people
form
new
ties
and
then
who
will
form
new
ties
both
you
and
helmer
when
i
am
gone
you
yourself
are
already
on
the
high
road
to
it
i
think
what
did
that
linde
want
here
last
night
oho
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
jealous
of
poor
christine
yes
i
am
she
will
be
my
successor
in
this
house
when
i
am
done
for
this
woman
will
hush
do
speak
so
loud
she
is
in
that
room
again
there
you
see
she
has
only
come
to
sew
my
dress
for
me
bless
my
soul
how
unreasonable
you
are
down
on
the
be
nice
now
doctor
rank
and
you
will
see
how
beautifully
i
shall
dance
and
you
can
imagine
i
am
doing
it
all
for
you
and
for
torvald
too
of
course
various
things
out
of
the
doctor
rank
come
and
sit
down
here
and
i
will
show
you
something
what
is
it
just
look
at
those
silk
stockings
are
they
lovely
it
is
so
dark
here
now
but
no
no
no
you
must
only
look
at
the
feet
oh
well
you
may
have
leave
to
look
at
the
legs
too
hm
why
are
you
looking
so
critical
do
you
think
they
will
fit
me
i
have
no
means
of
forming
an
opinion
about
that
at
him
for
a
for
shame
him
lightly
on
the
ear
with
the
that
to
punish
you
them
up
and
what
other
nice
things
am
i
to
be
allowed
to
see
not
a
single
thing
more
for
being
so
naughty
looks
among
the
things
humming
to
a
short
when
i
am
sitting
here
talking
to
you
as
intimately
as
this
i
can
not
imagine
for
a
moment
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
i
had
never
come
into
this
house
i
believe
you
do
feel
thoroughly
at
home
with
us
a
lower
voice
looking
straight
in
front
of
and
to
be
obliged
to
leave
it
all
nonsense
you
are
not
going
to
leave
it
and
not
be
able
to
leave
behind
one
the
slightest
token
of
one
gratitude
scarcely
even
a
fleeting
regret
nothing
but
an
empty
place
which
the
first
comer
can
fill
as
well
as
any
other
and
if
i
asked
you
now
for
a
no
for
what
for
a
big
proof
of
your
friendship
yes
yes
i
mean
a
tremendously
big
favour
would
you
really
make
me
so
happy
for
once
ah
but
you
do
know
what
it
is
yet
no
but
tell
me
i
really
ca
doctor
rank
it
is
something
out
of
all
reason
it
means
advice
and
help
and
a
favour
the
bigger
a
thing
it
is
the
better
i
ca
conceive
what
it
is
you
mean
do
tell
me
have
i
your
confidence
more
than
anyone
else
i
know
you
are
my
truest
and
best
friend
and
so
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
well
doctor
rank
it
is
something
you
must
help
me
to
prevent
you
know
how
devotedly
how
inexpressibly
deeply
torvald
loves
me
he
would
never
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
give
his
life
for
me
toward
nora
do
you
think
he
is
the
only
one
a
slight
the
only
one
the
only
one
who
would
gladly
give
his
life
for
your
sake
is
that
it
i
was
determined
you
should
know
it
before
i
went
away
and
there
will
never
be
a
better
opportunity
than
this
now
you
know
it
nora
and
now
you
know
too
that
you
can
trust
me
as
you
would
trust
no
one
else
deliberately
and
let
me
pass
room
for
her
to
pass
him
but
sits
nora
the
hall
helen
bring
in
the
lamp
over
to
the
dear
doctor
rank
that
was
really
horrid
of
you
to
have
loved
you
as
much
as
anyone
else
does
was
that
horrid
no
but
to
go
and
tell
me
so
there
was
really
no
need
what
do
you
mean
did
you
know
maid
with
lamp
puts
it
down
on
the
table
and
goes
nora
helmer
tell
me
had
you
any
idea
of
this
oh
how
do
i
know
whether
i
had
or
whether
i
had
i
really
ca
tell
you
to
think
you
could
be
so
clumsy
doctor
rank
we
were
getting
on
so
nicely
well
at
all
events
you
know
now
that
you
can
command
me
body
and
soul
so
wo
you
speak
out
at
after
what
happened
i
beg
you
to
let
me
know
what
it
is
i
ca
tell
you
anything
now
yes
yes
you
must
punish
me
in
that
way
let
me
have
permission
to
do
for
you
whatever
a
man
may
do
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
now
besides
i
really
do
need
any
help
at
all
you
will
find
that
the
whole
thing
is
merely
fancy
on
my
part
it
really
is
so
of
course
it
is
down
in
the
and
looks
at
him
with
a
you
are
a
nice
sort
of
man
doctor
rank
do
you
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
now
the
lamp
has
come
not
a
bit
but
perhaps
i
had
better
go
forever
no
indeed
you
shall
not
of
course
you
must
come
here
just
as
before
you
know
very
well
torvald
ca
do
without
you
yes
but
you
oh
i
am
always
tremendously
pleased
when
you
come
it
is
just
that
that
put
me
on
the
wrong
track
you
are
a
riddle
to
me
i
have
often
thought
that
you
would
almost
as
soon
be
in
my
company
as
in
helmer
yes
you
see
there
are
some
people
one
loves
best
and
others
whom
one
would
almost
always
rather
have
as
companions
yes
there
is
something
in
that
when
i
was
at
home
of
course
i
loved
papa
best
but
i
always
thought
it
tremendous
fun
if
i
could
steal
down
into
the
maids
room
because
they
never
moralized
at
all
and
talked
to
each
other
about
such
entertaining
things
i
see
it
is
their
place
i
have
taken
and
going
to
oh
dear
nice
doctor
rank
i
never
meant
that
at
all
but
surely
you
can
understand
that
being
with
torvald
is
a
little
like
being
with
papa
maid
the
if
you
please
and
hands
her
a
at
the
oh
it
in
her
is
there
anything
wrong
no
no
not
in
the
least
it
is
only
something
it
is
my
new
dress
what
your
dress
is
lying
there
oh
yes
that
one
but
this
is
another
i
ordered
it
torvald
must
know
about
it
oho
then
that
was
the
great
secret
of
course
just
go
in
to
him
he
is
sitting
in
the
inner
room
keep
him
as
long
as
make
your
mind
easy
i
wo
let
him
escape
helmer
maid
and
he
is
standing
waiting
in
the
kitchen
yes
he
came
up
the
back
stairs
but
did
you
tell
him
no
one
was
in
yes
but
it
was
no
good
he
wo
go
away
no
he
says
he
wo
until
he
has
seen
you
well
let
him
come
in
but
quietly
helen
you
must
say
anything
about
it
to
any
one
it
is
a
surprise
for
my
husband
yes
i
quite
understand
this
dreadful
thing
is
going
to
happen
it
will
happen
in
spite
of
me
no
no
no
it
ca
happen
it
sha
happen
bolts
the
door
helmer
maid
the
hall
door
krogstad
shuts
it
after
him
he
is
wearing
a
fur
coat
high
boots
and
a
fur
towards
speak
low
my
husband
is
at
home
no
matter
about
that
what
do
you
want
of
me
an
explanation
of
something
make
haste
then
what
is
it
you
know
i
suppose
that
i
have
got
my
dismissal
i
could
prevent
it
krogstad
i
fought
as
hard
as
i
could
on
your
side
but
it
was
no
good
does
your
husband
love
you
so
little
then
he
knows
what
i
can
expose
you
to
and
yet
he
ventures
how
can
you
suppose
that
he
has
any
knowledge
of
the
sort
i
did
suppose
so
at
all
it
would
not
be
the
least
like
our
dear
torvald
helmer
to
show
so
much
courage
krogstad
a
little
respect
for
my
husband
please
certainly
all
the
respect
he
deserves
but
since
you
have
kept
the
matter
so
carefully
to
yourself
i
make
bold
to
suppose
that
you
have
a
little
clearer
idea
than
you
had
yesterday
of
what
it
actually
is
that
you
have
done
more
than
you
could
ever
teach
me
yes
such
a
bad
lawyer
as
i
am
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
only
to
see
how
you
were
helmer
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
all
day
long
a
mere
cashier
a
a
well
a
man
like
me
even
he
has
a
little
of
what
is
called
feeling
you
know
show
it
then
think
of
my
little
children
have
you
and
your
husband
thought
of
mine
but
never
mind
about
that
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
need
not
take
this
matter
too
seriously
in
the
first
place
there
will
be
no
accusation
made
on
my
part
no
of
course
not
i
was
sure
of
that
the
whole
thing
can
be
arranged
amicably
there
is
no
reason
why
anyone
should
know
anything
about
it
it
will
remain
a
secret
between
us
three
my
husband
must
never
get
to
know
anything
about
it
how
will
you
be
able
to
prevent
it
am
i
to
understand
that
you
can
pay
the
balance
that
is
owing
no
not
just
at
present
or
perhaps
that
you
have
some
expedient
for
raising
the
money
soon
no
expedient
that
i
mean
to
make
use
of
well
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
you
now
if
you
stood
there
with
ever
so
much
money
in
your
hand
i
would
never
part
with
your
bond
tell
me
what
purpose
you
mean
to
put
it
to
i
shall
only
preserve
it
keep
it
in
my
possession
no
one
who
is
not
concerned
in
the
matter
shall
have
the
slightest
hint
of
it
so
that
if
the
thought
of
it
has
driven
you
to
any
desperate
resolution
it
has
if
you
had
it
in
your
mind
to
run
away
from
your
home
i
had
or
even
something
worse
how
could
you
know
that
give
up
the
idea
how
did
you
know
i
had
thought
of
most
of
us
think
of
that
at
first
i
did
too
but
i
the
courage
no
more
had
i
a
tone
of
relief
no
that
it
is
it
you
the
courage
either
no
i
have
i
have
besides
it
would
have
been
a
great
piece
of
folly
once
the
first
storm
at
home
is
over
i
have
a
letter
for
your
husband
in
my
pocket
telling
him
everything
in
as
lenient
a
manner
as
i
possibly
could
he
must
get
the
letter
tear
it
up
i
will
find
some
means
of
getting
money
excuse
me
helmer
but
i
think
i
told
you
just
how
i
am
not
speaking
of
what
i
owe
you
tell
me
what
sum
you
are
asking
my
husband
for
and
i
will
get
the
money
i
am
not
asking
your
husband
for
a
penny
what
do
you
want
then
i
will
tell
you
i
want
to
rehabilitate
myself
helmer
i
want
to
get
on
and
in
that
your
husband
must
help
me
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
i
have
not
had
a
hand
in
anything
dishonourable
and
all
that
time
i
have
been
struggling
in
most
restricted
circumstances
i
was
content
to
work
my
way
up
step
by
step
now
i
am
turned
out
and
i
am
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
merely
being
taken
into
favour
again
i
want
to
get
on
i
tell
you
i
want
to
get
into
the
bank
again
in
a
higher
position
your
husband
must
make
a
place
for
me
that
he
will
never
do
he
will
i
know
him
he
dare
not
protest
and
as
soon
as
i
am
in
there
again
with
him
then
you
will
see
within
a
year
i
shall
be
the
manager
right
hand
it
will
be
nils
krogstad
and
not
torvald
helmer
who
manages
the
bank
that
a
thing
you
will
never
see
do
you
mean
that
you
will
i
have
courage
enough
for
it
now
oh
you
ca
frighten
me
a
fine
spoilt
lady
like
you
you
will
see
you
will
see
under
the
ice
perhaps
down
into
the
cold
water
and
then
in
the
spring
to
float
up
to
the
surface
all
horrible
and
unrecognizable
with
your
hair
fallen
out
you
ca
frighten
me
nor
you
me
people
do
do
such
things
helmer
besides
what
use
would
it
be
i
should
have
him
completely
in
my
power
all
the
same
afterwards
when
i
am
no
longer
have
you
forgot
that
it
is
i
who
have
the
keeping
of
your
reputation
stands
speechlessly
looking
at
him
well
now
i
have
warned
you
do
not
do
anything
foolish
when
helmer
has
had
my
letter
i
shall
expect
a
message
from
him
and
be
sure
you
remember
that
it
is
your
husband
himself
who
has
forced
me
into
such
ways
as
this
again
i
will
never
forgive
him
for
that
helmer
through
the
hall
to
the
hall

stifled

me
anything
for
instance
that
might
prevent
my
being
here
nora
nora

are
quite
out

the
blame

of
my
mind

am
in
my
right
senses

anything
about
it

ask
for

is
it
that
you
are
waiting
for
oh
you
would
understand

in
to
them
i
will
come
in
a
moment
linde
into
the
nora

little
while

hours
till

tarantella

hours

the
where
my
little
skylark
to
him
with
her
arms
here

is

iii
the
same
scene
table
has
been
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
with
chairs
around
it
a
lamp
is
burning
on
the
table
the
door
into
the
hall
stands
open
dance
music
is
heard
in
the
room
linde
sitting
at
the
table
idly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
she
tries
to
read
but
does
not
seem
able
to
collect
her
thoughts
every
now
and
then
she
listens
intently
for
a
sound
at
the
outer
at
her
not
yet
and
the
time
is
nearly
up
if
only
he
does
not
ah
there
he
is
into
the
hall
and
opens
the
outer
door
carefully
light
footsteps
are
heard
on
the
stairs
she
come
in
there
is
no
one
here
the
i
found
a
note
from
you
at
home
what
does
this
mean
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
have
a
talk
with
you
really
and
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
it
should
be
here
it
is
impossible
where
i
live
there
is
no
private
entrance
to
my
rooms
come
in
we
are
quite
alone
the
maid
is
asleep
and
the
helmers
are
at
the
dance
upstairs
into
the
are
the
helmers
really
at
a
dance
tonight
yes
why
not
certainly
why
not
now
nils
let
us
have
a
talk
can
we
two
have
anything
to
talk
about
we
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
i
should
have
thought
so
no
you
have
never
properly
understood
me
was
there
anything
else
to
understand
except
what
was
obvious
to
all
the
world
a
heartless
woman
jilts
a
man
when
a
more
lucrative
chance
turns
up
do
you
believe
i
am
as
absolutely
heartless
as
all
that
and
do
you
believe
that
i
did
it
with
a
light
heart
did
you
nils
did
you
really
think
that
if
it
were
as
you
say
why
did
you
write
to
me
as
you
did
at
the
time
i
could
do
nothing
else
as
i
had
to
break
with
you
it
was
my
duty
also
to
put
an
end
to
all
that
you
felt
for
me
his
so
that
was
it
and
all
this
only
for
the
sake
of
money
you
must
not
forget
that
i
had
a
helpless
mother
and
two
little
brothers
we
could
wait
for
you
nils
your
prospects
seemed
hopeless
then
that
may
be
so
but
you
had
no
right
to
throw
me
over
for
any
one
else
sake
indeed
i
do
know
many
a
time
did
i
ask
myself
if
i
had
a
right
to
do
it
when
i
lost
you
it
was
as
if
all
the
solid
ground
went
from
under
my
feet
look
at
me
now
i
am
a
shipwrecked
man
clinging
to
a
bit
of
wreckage
but
help
may
be
near
it
near
but
then
you
came
and
stood
in
my
way
unintentionally
nils
it
was
only
today
that
i
learnt
it
was
your
place
i
was
going
to
take
in
the
bank
i
believe
you
if
you
say
so
but
now
that
you
know
it
are
you
not
going
to
give
it
up
to
me
no
because
that
would
not
benefit
you
in
the
least
oh
benefit
benefit
i
would
have
done
it
whether
or
no
i
have
learnt
to
act
prudently
life
and
hard
bitter
necessity
have
taught
me
that
and
life
has
taught
me
not
to
believe
in
fine
speeches
then
life
has
taught
you
something
very
reasonable
but
deeds
you
must
believe
in
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
said
you
were
like
a
shipwrecked
man
clinging
to
some
wreckage
i
had
good
reason
to
say
so
well
i
am
like
a
shipwrecked
woman
clinging
to
some
wreckage
no
one
to
mourn
for
no
one
to
care
for
it
was
your
own
choice
there
was
no
other
choice
then
well
what
now
nils
how
would
it
be
if
we
two
shipwrecked
people
could
join
forces
what
are
you
saying
two
on
the
same
piece
of
wreckage
would
stand
a
better
chance
than
each
on
their
own
christine
what
do
you
suppose
brought
me
to
town
do
you
mean
that
you
gave
me
a
thought
i
could
not
endure
life
without
work
all
my
life
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
have
worked
and
it
has
been
my
greatest
and
only
pleasure
but
now
i
am
quite
alone
in
the
world
my
life
is
so
dreadfully
empty
and
i
feel
so
forsaken
there
is
not
the
least
pleasure
in
working
for
one
self
nils
give
me
someone
and
something
to
work
for
i
do
trust
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
woman
overstrained
sense
of
generosity
that
prompts
you
to
make
such
an
offer
of
your
self
have
you
ever
noticed
anything
of
the
sort
in
me
could
you
really
do
it
tell
me
do
you
know
all
about
my
past
life
yes
and
do
you
know
what
they
think
of
me
here
you
seemed
to
me
to
imply
that
with
me
you
might
have
been
quite
another
man
i
am
certain
of
it
is
it
too
late
now
christine
are
you
saying
this
deliberately
yes
i
am
sure
you
are
i
see
it
in
your
face
have
you
really
the
courage
then
i
want
to
be
a
mother
to
someone
and
your
children
need
a
mother
we
two
need
each
other
nils
i
have
faith
in
your
real
character
i
can
dare
anything
together
with
you
her
thanks
thanks
christine
now
i
shall
find
a
way
to
clear
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
ah
but
i
forgot
hush
the
tarantella
go
go
why
what
is
it
do
you
hear
them
up
there
when
that
is
over
we
may
expect
them
back
yes
yes
i
will
go
but
it
is
all
no
use
of
course
you
are
not
aware
what
steps
i
have
taken
in
the
matter
of
the
helmers
yes
i
know
all
about
that
and
in
spite
of
that
have
you
the
courage
to
i
understand
very
well
to
what
lengths
a
man
like
you
might
be
driven
by
despair
if
i
could
only
undo
what
i
have
done
you
can
not
your
letter
is
lying
in
the
now
are
you
sure
of
that
quite
sure
but
a
searching
look
at
is
that
what
it
all
means
that
you
want
to
save
your
friend
at
any
cost
tell
me
frankly
is
that
it
nils
a
woman
who
has
once
sold
herself
for
sake
does
do
it
a
second
time
i
will
ask
for
my
letter
back
no
no
yes
of
course
i
will
i
will
wait
here
till
helmer
comes
i
will
tell
him
he
must
give
me
my
letter
back
that
it
only
concerns
my
dismissal
that
he
is
not
to
read
it
no
nils
you
must
not
recall
your
letter
but
tell
me
was
it
for
that
very
purpose
that
you
asked
me
to
meet
you
here
in
my
first
moment
of
fright
it
was
but
hours
have
elapsed
since
then
and
in
that
time
i
have
witnessed
incredible
things
in
this
house
helmer
must
know
all
about
it
this
unhappy
secret
must
be
enclosed
they
must
have
a
complete
understanding
between
them
which
is
impossible
with
all
this
concealment
and
falsehood
going
on
very
well
if
you
will
take
the
responsibility
but
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
in
any
case
and
i
shall
do
it
at
once
you
must
be
quick
and
go
the
dance
is
over
we
are
not
safe
a
moment
longer
i
will
wait
for
you
below
yes
do
you
must
see
me
back
to
my
door
i
have
never
had
such
an
amazing
piece
of
good
fortune
in
my
life
out
through
the
outer
door
the
door
between
the
room
and
the
hall
remains
up
the
room
and
laying
her
hat
and
cloak
what
a
difference
what
a
difference
someone
to
work
for
and
live
for
a
home
to
bring
comfort
into
that
i
will
do
indeed
i
wish
they
would
be
quick
and
come
ah
there
they
are
now
i
must
put
on
my
things
up
her
hat
and
helmer
are
heard
outside
a
key
is
turned
helmer
nora
by
force
into
the
hall
she
is
in
an
italian
costume
with
a
large
black
shawl
round
her
he
is
in
evening
dress
and
a
black
domino
which
is
flying
back
in
the
doorway
and
struggling
with
no
no
no
do
take
me
in
i
want
to
go
upstairs
again
i
do
want
to
leave
so
early
but
my
dearest
nora
please
torvald
dear
please
only
an
hour
more
not
a
single
minute
my
sweet
nora
you
know
that
was
our
agreement
come
along
into
the
room
you
are
catching
cold
standing
there
brings
her
gently
into
the
room
in
spite
of
her
good
evening
christine
you
here
so
late
linde
yes
you
must
excuse
me
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
nora
in
her
dress
have
you
been
sitting
here
waiting
for
me
yes
unfortunately
i
came
too
late
you
had
already
gone
upstairs
and
i
thought
i
could
go
away
again
without
having
seen
you
nora
yes
take
a
good
look
at
her
i
think
she
is
worth
looking
at
is
she
charming
linde
yes
indeed
she
is
does
she
look
remarkably
pretty
everyone
thought
so
at
the
dance
but
she
is
terribly
this
sweet
little
person
what
are
we
to
do
with
her
you
will
hardly
believe
that
i
had
almost
to
bring
her
away
by
force
torvald
you
will
repent
not
having
let
me
stay
even
if
it
were
only
for
half
an
hour
listen
to
her
linde
she
had
danced
her
tarantella
and
it
had
been
a
tremendous
success
as
it
deserved
although
possibly
the
performance
was
a
trifle
too
realistic
little
more
so
i
mean
than
was
strictly
compatible
with
the
limitations
of
art
but
never
mind
about
that
the
chief
thing
is
she
had
made
a
success
she
had
made
a
tremendous
success
do
you
think
i
was
going
to
let
her
remain
there
after
that
and
spoil
the
effect
no
indeed
i
took
my
charming
little
capri
maiden
my
capricious
little
capri
maiden
i
should
say
on
my
arm
took
one
quick
turn
round
the
room
a
curtsey
on
either
side
and
as
they
say
in
novels
the
beautiful
apparition
disappeared
an
exit
ought
always
to
be
effective
linde
but
that
is
what
i
can
not
make
nora
understand
pooh
this
room
is
hot
his
domino
on
a
chair
and
opens
the
door
of
his
hullo
it
all
dark
in
here
oh
of
course
excuse
me
goes
in
and
lights
some
a
hurried
and
breathless
well
a
low
i
have
had
a
talk
with
him
yes
and
nora
you
must
tell
your
husband
all
about
it
an
expressionless
i
knew
it
you
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
as
far
as
krogstad
is
concerned
but
you
must
tell
him
i
wo
tell
him
then
the
letter
will
thank
you
christine
now
i
know
what
i
must
do
hush
in
well
linde
have
you
admired
her
yes
and
now
i
will
say
what
already
is
this
yours
this
knitting
yes
thank
you
i
had
very
nearly
forgotten
it
so
you
knit
of
course
do
you
know
you
ought
to
embroider
really
why
yes
it
far
more
becoming
let
me
show
you
you
hold
the
embroidery
thus
in
your
left
hand
and
use
the
needle
with
the
right
like
this
with
a
long
easy
sweep
do
you
see
yes
perhaps
but
in
the
case
of
knitting
that
can
never
be
anything
but
ungraceful
look
here
the
arms
close
together
the
going
up
and
down
it
has
a
sort
of
chinese
effect
that
was
really
excellent
champagne
they
gave
us
well
nora
and
do
be
any
more
that
right
linde
helmer
her
to
the
i
hope
you
will
get
home
all
right
i
should
be
very
happy
to
but
you
have
any
great
distance
to
go
goes
out
he
shuts
the
door
after
her
and
comes
in
ah
at
last
we
have
got
rid
of
her
she
is
a
frightful
bore
that
woman
are
you
very
tired
torvald
no
not
in
the
least
nor
sleepy
not
a
bit
on
the
contrary
i
feel
extraordinarily
lively
and
you
you
really
look
both
tired
and
sleepy
yes
i
am
very
tired
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
at
once
there
you
see
it
was
quite
right
of
me
not
to
let
you
stay
there
any
longer
everything
you
do
is
quite
right
torvald
her
on
the
now
my
little
skylark
is
speaking
reasonably
did
you
notice
what
good
spirits
rank
was
in
this
evening
really
was
he
i
did
speak
to
him
at
all
and
i
very
little
but
i
have
not
for
a
long
time

such
good
form

a
while
at
her

be
at
home
by
ourselves
again
to
be
all
alone
with
you
you
fascinating
charming
little
darling
do
look
at
me

torvald

i
look
at
my
dearest
treasure

all
the
beauty
that

mine
all
my
very
own
to
the
other
side
of
the
you

say
things
like
that
to
me
tonight
you
have
still
got
the
tarantella
in
your
blood
i
see
and
it
makes
you
more
captivating
than
ever
listen
the
guests
are
beginning
to
go
now

lower
nora

whole
house
will
be
quiet

my
own
darling
nora
do
you
know
when
i
am
out
at
a
party
with
you
like
this
why
i
speak
so
little
to
you
keep
away
from
you
and
only
send
a
stolen
glance
in
your
direction
now
and
then
do
you
know
why
i
do
that
it
is
because
i
make
believe
to
myself
that
we
are
secretly
in
love
and
you
are
my
secretly
promised
bride
and
that
no
one
suspects
there
is
anything
between
us
yes
yes
i
know
very
well
your
thoughts
are
with
me
all
the
time
and
when
we
are
leaving
and
i
am
putting
the
shawl
over
your
beautiful
young
shoulders
on
your
lovely
neck
then
i
imagine
that
you
are
my
young
bride
and
that
we
have
just
come
from
the
wedding
and
i
am
bringing
you
for
the
first
time
into
our
home
to
be
alone
with
you
for
the
first
time
quite
alone
with
my
shy
little
darling
all
this
evening
i
have
longed
for
nothing
but
you
when
i
watched
the
seductive
figures
of
the
tarantella
my
blood
was
on
fire
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
that
was
why
i
brought
you
down
so
early
go
away
torvald
you
must
let
me
go
i
wo
what
that
you
joking
my
little
nora
you
wo
you
wo
am
i
not
your
husband
knock
is
heard
at
the
outer
did
you
hear
into
the
who
is
it
it
is
i
may
i
come
in
for
a
moment
a
fretful
oh
what
does
he
want
now
wait
a
minute
the
come
that
kind
of
you
not
to
pass
by
our
door
i
thought
i
heard
your
voice
and
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
look
in
a
swift
glance
ah
yes
these
dear
familiar
rooms
you
are
very
happy
and
cosy
in
here
you
two
it
seems
to
me
that
you
looked
after
yourself
pretty
well
upstairs
too
excellently
why
should
i
why
should
one
enjoy
everything
in
this
world
at
any
rate
as
much
as
one
can
and
as
long
as
one
can
the
wine
was
capital
especially
the
champagne
so
you
noticed
that
too
it
is
almost
incredible
how
much
i
managed
to
put
away
torvald
drank
a
great
deal
of
champagne
tonight
too
did
he
yes
and
he
is
always
in
such
good
spirits
afterwards
well
why
should
one
not
enjoy
a
merry
evening
after
a
day
well
spent
i
am
afraid
i
ca
take
credit
for
that
him
on
the
but
i
can
you
know
doctor
rank
you
must
have
been
occupied
with
some
scientific
investigation
today
exactly
just
listen
little
nora
talking
about
scientific
investigations
and
may
i
congratulate
you
on
the
result

may
was
it
favourable
then
the
best
possible
for
both
doctor
and
patient
certainty
and
certainty
absolute
certainty
so
was
i
entitled
to
make
a
merry
evening
of
it
after
that
yes
you
certainly
were
doctor
rank
i
think
so
too
so
long
as
you
do
have
to
pay
for
it
in
the
morning
oh

ca
have
anything
in
this
life
without
paying
for
it
doctor
rank

you
fond
of
balls

a
fine
lot
of
pretty
costumes

really
very
prettily
turned
but

what
you
will
be
yes
my
dear
friend
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
that
well
at
the
next
ball

shall
be
invisible
that
a
good
joke
there
is
a
big
black
hat
have
you
never
heard
of
hats
that
make
you
invisible
if
you
put
one
on
no
one
can
see
you

quite
right
but
i
am
clean

light
nods
to
them

and
goes
a
subdued
he
has
drunk
more
than
he
ought
maybe
helmer
a
bunch
of
keys
out
of
his
pocket
and
goes
into
the
torvald
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
empty
the
it
is
quite
full
there
will
be
no
room
to
put
the
newspaper
in
morning
are
you
going
to
work
you
know
quite
well
i
not
what
is
this
some
one
has
been
at
the
lock
at
the
lock
yes
someone
has
what
can
it
mean
i
should
never
have
thought
the
maid
here
is
a
broken
hairpin
nora
it
is
one
of
yours
then
it
must
have
been
the
children
then
you
must
get
them
out
of
those
ways
there
at
last
i
have
got
it
open
out
the
contents
of
the
and
calls
to
the
helen
helen
put
out
the
light
over
the
front
door
back
into
the
room
and
shuts
the
door
into
the
hall
he
holds
out
his
hand
full
of
look
at
that
look
what
a
heap
of
them
there
are
them
what
on
earth
is
that
the
the
letter
no
torvald
no
two
cards
of
rank
of
doctor
rank
at
doctor
rank
they
were
on
the
top
he
must
have
put
them
in
when
he
went
out
is
there
anything
written
on
them
there
is
a
black
cross
over
the
name
look
there
what
an
uncomfortable
idea
it
looks
as
if
he
were
announcing
his
own
death
it
is
just
what
he
is
doing
what
do
you
know
anything
about
it
has
he
said
anything
to
you
yes
he
told
me
that
when
the
cards
came
it
would
be
his
from
us
he
means
to
shut
himself
up
and
die
my
poor
old
friend
certainly
i
knew
we
should
not
have
him
very
long
with
us
but
so
soon
and
so
he
hides
himself
away
like
a
wounded
animal
if
it
has
to
happen
it
is
best
it
should
be
without
a
word
do
you
think
so
torvald
up
and
he
has
so
grown
into
our
lives
i
ca
think
of
him
as
having
gone
out
of
them
he
with
his
sufferings
and
his
loneliness
was
like
a
cloudy
background
to
our
sunlit
happiness
well
perhaps
it
is
best
so
for
him
anyway
and
perhaps
for
us
too
nora
we
two
are
thrown
quite
upon
each
other
now
his
arms
around
my
darling
wife
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
hold
you
tight
enough
do
you
know
nora
i
have
often
wished
that
you
might
be
threatened
by
some
great
danger
so
that
i
might
risk
my
life
blood
and
everything
for
your
sake
herself
and
says
firmly
and
now
you
must
read
your
letters
torvald
no
no
not
tonight
i
want
to
be
with
you
my
darling
wife
with
the
thought
of
your
friend
death
you
are
right
it
has
affected
us
both
something
ugly
has
come
between
us
the
thought
of
the
horrors
of
death
we
must
try
and
rid
our
minds
of
that
until
then
we
will
each
go
to
our
own
room
on
his
torvald
her
on
the
my
little
sleep
sound
nora
now
i
will
read
my
letters
through
takes
his
letters
and
goes
into
his
room
shutting
the
door
after
distractedly
about
helmer
throws
it
round
her
while
she
says
in
quick
hoarse
spasmodic
never
to
see
him
again
never
never
her
shawl
over
her
never
to
see
my
children
again
either
never
again
never
never
ah
the
icy
black
water
the
unfathomable
depths
if
only
it
were
over
he
has
got
it
now
now
he
is
reading
it
torvald
and
my
children
is
about
to
rush
out
through
the
hall
helmer
his
door
hurriedly
and
stands
with
an
open
letter
in
his
nora
ah

is
this
do
you
know
what
is
in
this
letter
yes
i
know

me
go

me
get
out
her
where
are
you
going
to
get
you
sha
save
me
torvald
true
is
this
true
that
i
read
here
horrible
no
no
it
is
impossible
that
it
can
be
true
it
is
true
i
have
loved
you
above
everything
else
in
the
world
oh
do
let
us
have
any
silly
excuses
a
step
towards
torvald
miserable
creature
what
have
you
done
let
me
go
you
shall
not
suffer
for
my
sake
you
shall
not
take
it
upon
yourself
no
tragedy
airs
please
the
hall
here
you
shall
stay
and
give
me
an
explanation
do
you
understand
what
you
have
done
answer
me
do
you
understand
what
you
have
done
steadily
at
him
and
says
with
a
growing
look
of
coldness
in
her
yes
now
i
am
beginning
to
understand
thoroughly
about
the
what
a
horrible
awakening
all
these
eight
years
she
who
was
my
joy
and
pride
a
hypocrite
a
liar
worse
worse
a
criminal
the
unutterable
ugliness
of
it
all
for
shame
for
shame
nora
silent
and
looks
steadily
at
him
he
stops
in
front
of
i
ought
to
have
suspected
that
something
of
the
sort
would
happen
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
it
all
your
father
want
of
principle
be
silent
all
your
father
want
of
principle
has
come
out
in
you
no
religion
no
morality
no
sense
of
duty
how
i
am
punished
for
having
winked
at
what
he
did
i
did
it
for
your
sake
and
this
is
how
you
repay
me
yes
that
just
it
now
you
have
destroyed
all
my
happiness
you
have
ruined
all
my
future
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
i
am
in
the
power
of
an
unscrupulous
man
he
can
do
what
he
likes
with
me
ask
anything
he
likes
of
me
give
me
any
orders
he
pleases
i
dare
not
refuse
and
i
must
sink
to
such
miserable
depths
because
of
a
thoughtless
woman
when
i
am
out
of
the
way
you
will
be
free
no
fine
speeches
please
your
father
had
always
plenty
of
those
ready
too
what
good
would
it
be
to
me
if
you
were
out
of
the
way
as
you
say
not
the
slightest
he
can
make
the
affair
known
everywhere
and
if
he
does
i
may
be
falsely
suspected
of
having
been
a
party
to
your
criminal
action
very
likely
people
will
think
i
was
behind
it
all
that
it
was
i
who
prompted
you
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
all
this
you
whom
i
have
cherished
during
the
whole
of
our
married
life
do
you
understand
now
what
it
is
you
have
done
for
me
and
yes
it
is
so
incredible
that
i
ca
take
it
in
but
we
must
come
to
some
understanding
take
off
that
shawl
take
it
off
i
tell
you
i
must
try
and
appease
him
some
way
or
another
the
matter
must
be
hushed
up
at
any
cost
and
as
for
you
and
me
it
must
appear
as
if
everything
between
us
were
as
before
but
naturally
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
you
will
still
remain
in
my
house
that
is
a
matter
of
course
but
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
bring
up
the
children
i
dare
not
trust
them
to
you
to
think
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
say
so
to
one
whom
i
have
loved
so
dearly
and
whom
i
still
no
that
is
all
over
from
this
moment
happiness
is
not
the
question
all
that
concerns
us
is
to
save
the
remains
the
fragments
the
appearance
ring
is
heard
at
the
a
what
is
that
so
late
can
the
worst
can
he
hide
yourself
nora
say
you
are
nora
helmer
and
unlocks
the
hall
comes
to
the
a
letter
for
the
mistress
give
it
to
me
the
letter
and
shuts
the
yes
it
is
from
him
you
shall
not
have
it
i
will
read
it
myself
yes
read
it
by
the
i
scarcely
have
the
courage
to
do
it
it
may
mean
ruin
for
both
of
us
no
i
must
know
open
the
letter
runs
his
eye
over
a
few
lines
looks
at
a
paper
enclosed
and
gives
a
shout
of
nora
looks
at
him
nora
no
i
must
read
it
once
again
yes
it
is
true
i
am
saved
nora
i
am
saved
and
i
you
too
of
course
we
are
both
saved
both
saved
both
you
and
i
look
he
sends
you
your
bond
back
he
says
he
regrets
and
repents
that
a
happy
change
in
his
life
never
mind
what
he
says
we
are
saved
nora
no
one
can
do
anything
to
you
oh
nora
nora
no
first
i
must
destroy
these
hateful
things
let
me
see
a
look
at
the
no
no
i
wo
look
at
it
the
whole
thing
shall
be
nothing
but
a
bad
dream
to
me
up
the
bond
and
both
letters
throws
them
all
into
the
stove
and
watches
them
there
now
it
does
exist
any
longer
he
says
that
since
christmas
eve
you
these
must
have
been
three
dreadful
days
for
you
nora
i
have
fought
a
hard
fight
these
three
days
and
suffered
agonies
and
seen
no
way
out
but
no
we
call
any
of
the
horrors
to
mind
we
will
only
shout
with
joy
and
keep
saying
it
all
over
it
all
over
listen
to
me
nora
you
seem
to
realise
that
it
is
all
over
what
is
this
such
a
cold
set
face
my
poor
little
nora
i
quite
understand
you
do
feel
as
if
you
could
believe
that
i
have
forgiven
you
but
it
is
true
nora
i
swear
it
i
have
forgiven
you
everything

know
that

you
did

did
out
of
love
for
me
that
is
true
you
have
loved
me
as
a
wife
ought
to
love
her
husband
only
you
had
not
sufficient
knowledge
to
judge
of
the
means
you
used
but
do
you
suppose
you
are
any
the
less
dear
to
me
because
you
understand
how
to
act
on
your
own
responsibility
no
no
only
lean
on
me
i
will
advise
you
and
direct
you
i
should
not
be
a
man
if
this
womanly
helplessness
did
not
just
give
you
a
double
attractiveness
in
my
eyes
you
must
not
think
any
more
about
the
hard
things
i
said
in
my
first
moment
of
consternation
when
i
thought
everything
was
going
to
overwhelm
me
i
have
forgiven
you
nora
i
swear
to
you
i
have
forgiven
you

you
for
your
forgiveness

upon
it
all
quite
differently
soon
everything
will
be
just
as
it
was
before
very
soon
you
wo
need
me
to
assure
you
that
i
have
forgiven
you
you
will
yourself
feel
the
certainty
that
i
have
done
so
can
you
suppose
i
should
ever
think
of
such
a
thing
as
repudiating
you
or
even
reproaching
you
you
have
no
idea
what
a
true
man
heart
is
like
nora
there
is
something
so
indescribably
sweet
and
satisfying
to
a
man
in
the
knowledge
that
he
has
forgiven
his
wife
forgiven
her
freely
and
with
all
his
heart
it
seems
as
if
that
had
made
her
as
it
were
doubly
his
own
he
has
given
her
a
new
life
so
to
speak
and
she
is
in
a
way
become
both
wife
and
child
to
him
so
you
shall
be
for
me
after
this
my
little
scared
helpless
darling
have
no
anxiety
about
anything
nora
only
be
frank
and
open
with
me
and
i
will
serve
as
will
and
conscience
both
to
you
what
is
this
not
gone
to
bed
have
you
changed
your
things
everyday
yes
torvald
i
have
changed
my
things
now
but
what
for
so
late
as
this
i
shall
not
sleep
tonight
but
my
dear
nora
at
her
it
is
not
so
very
late
sit
down
here
torvald
you
and
i
have
much
to
say
to
one
another
sits
down
at
one
side
of
the
nora
what
is
this
this
cold
set
face
sit
down
it
will
take
some
time
i
have
a
lot
to
talk
over
with
you
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
you
alarm
me
nora
and
i
do
understand
you
no
that
is
just
it
you
do
understand
me
and
i
have
never
understood
you
either
before
tonight
no
you
must
interrupt
me
you
must
simply
listen
to
what
i
say
torvald
this
is
a
settling
of
accounts
what
do
you
mean
by
that
a
short
is
there
one
thing
that
strikes
you
as
strange
in
our
sitting
here
like
this
what
is
that
we
have
been
married
now
eight
years
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
this
is
the
first
time
we
two
you
and
i
husband
and
wife
have
had
a
serious
conversation
what
do
you
mean
by
serious
in
all
these
eight
years
longer
than
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
we
have
never
exchanged
a
word
on
any
serious
subject
was
it
likely
that
i
would
be
continually
and
forever
telling
you
about
worries
that
you
could
not
help
me
to
bear
i
am
not
speaking
about
business
matters
i
say
that
we
have
never
sat
down
in
earnest
together
to
try
and
get
at
the
bottom
of
anything
but
dearest
nora
would
it
have
been
any
good
to
you
that
is
just
it
you
have
never
understood
me
i
have
been
greatly
wronged
torvald
first
by
papa
and
then
by
you
what
by
us
two
by
us
two
who
have
loved
you
better
than
anyone
else
in
in
the
world
her
you
have
never
loved
me
you
have
only
thought
it
pleasant
to
be
in
love
with
me
nora
what
do
i
hear
you
saying
it
is
perfectly
true
torvald
when
i
was
at
home
with
papa
he
told
me
his
opinion
about
everything
and
so
i
had
the
same
opinions
and
if
i
differed
from
him
i
concealed
the
fact
because
he
would
not
have
liked
it
he
called
me
his
and
he
played
with
me
just
as
i
used
to
play
with
my
dolls
and
when
i
came
to
live
with
you
what
sort
of
an
expression
is
that
to
use
about
our
marriage
i
mean
that
i
was
simply
transferred
from
hands
into
yours
you
arranged
everything
according
to
your
own
taste
and
so
i
got
the
same
tastes
as
you
or
else
i
pretended
to
i
am
really
not
quite
sure
which
i
think
sometimes
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
when
i
look
back
on
it
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
living
here
like
a
poor
woman
just
from
hand
to
mouth
i
have
existed
merely
to
perform
tricks
for
you
torvald
but
you
would
have
it
so
you
and
papa
have
committed
a
great
sin
against
me
it
is
your
fault
that
i
have
made
nothing
of
my
life
how
unreasonable
and
how
ungrateful
you
are
nora
have
you
not
been
happy
here
no
i
have
never
been
happy
i
thought
i
was
but
it
has
never
really
been
so
not
not
happy
no
only
merry
and
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
but
our
home
has
been
nothing
but
a
playroom
i
have
been
your
just
as
at
home
i
was
papa
and
here
the
children
have
been
my
dolls
i
thought
it
great
fun
when
you
played
with
me
just
as
they
thought
it
great
fun
when
i
played
with
them
that
is
what
our
marriage
has
been
torvald
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
exaggerated
and
strained
as
your
view
of
it
is
but
for
the
future
it
shall
be
different
playtime
shall
be
over
and
shall
begin
whose
lessons
mine
or
the
children
both
yours
and
the
children
my
darling
nora
alas
torvald
you
are
not
the
man
to
educate
me
into
being
a
proper
wife
for
you
and
you
can
say
that
and
i
how
am
i
fitted
to
bring
up
the
children
nora
did
you
say
so
yourself
a
little
while
ago
that
you
dare
not
trust
me
to
bring
them
up
in
a
moment
of
anger
why
do
you
pay
any
heed
to
that
indeed
you
were
perfectly
right
i
am
not
fit
for
the
task
there
is
another
task
i
must
undertake
first
i
must
try
and
educate
myself
you
are
not
the
man
to
help
me
in
that
i
must
do
that
for
myself
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
leave
you
now
what
do
you
say
i
must
stand
quite
alone
if
i
am
to
understand
myself
and
everything
about
me
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
can
not
remain
with
you
any
longer
nora
nora
i
am
going
away
from
here
now
at
once
i
am
sure
christine
will
take
me
in
for
the
night
you
are
out
of
your
mind
i
wo
allow
it
i
forbid
you
it
is
no
use
forbidding
me
anything
any
longer
i
will
take
with
me
what
belongs
to
myself
i
will
take
nothing
from
you
either
now
or
later
what
sort
of
madness
is
this
tomorrow
i
shall
go
home
i
mean
to
my
old
home
it
will
be
easiest
for
me
to
find
something
to
do
there
you
blind
foolish
woman
i
must
try
and
get
some
sense
torvald
to
desert
your
home
your
husband
and
your
children
and
you
do
consider
what
people
will
say
i
can
not
consider
that
at
all
i
only
know
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
it
shocking
this
is
how
you
would
neglect
your
most
sacred
duties
what
do
you
consider
my
most
sacred
duties
do
i
need
to
tell
you
that
are
they
not
your
duties
to
your
husband
and
your
children
i
have
other
duties
just
as
sacred
that
you
have
not
what
duties
could
those
be
duties
to
myself
before
all
else
you
are
a
wife
and
mother
i
do
believe
that
any
longer
i
believe
that
before
all
else
i
am
a
reasonable
human
being
just
as
you
are
or
at
all
events
that
i
must
try
and
become
one
i
know
quite
well
torvald
that
most
people
would
think
you
right
and
that
views
of
that
kind
are
to
be
found
in
books
but
i
can
no
longer
content
myself
with
what
most
people
say
or
with
what
is
found
in
books
i
must
think
over
things
for
myself
and
get
to
understand
them
can
you
not
understand
your
place
in
your
own
home
have
you
not
a
reliable
guide
in
such
matters
as
that
have
you
no
religion
i
am
afraid
torvald
i
do
not
exactly
know
what
religion
is
what
are
you
saying
i
know
nothing
but
what
the
clergyman
said
when
i
went
to
be
confirmed
he
told
us
that
religion
was
this
and
that
and
the
other
when
i
am
away
from
all
this
and
am
alone
i
will
look
into
that
matter
too
i
will
see
if
what
the
clergyman
said
is
true
or
at
all
events
if
it
is
true
for
me
this
is
unheard
of
in
a
girl
of
your
age
but
if
religion
can
not
lead
you
aright
let
me
try
and
awaken
your
conscience
i
suppose
you
have
some
moral
sense
or
answer
me
am
i
to
think
you
have
none
i
assure
you
torvald
that
is
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
i
really
do
know
the
thing
perplexes
me
altogether
i
only
know
that
you
and
i
look
at
it
in
quite
a
different
light
i
am
learning
too
that
the
law
is
quite
another
thing
from
what
i
supposed
but
i
find
it
impossible
to
convince
myself
that
the
law
is
right
according
to
it
a
woman
has
no
right
to
spare
her
old
dying
father
or
to
save
her
husband
life
i
ca
believe
that
you
talk
like
a
child
you
do
understand
the
conditions
of
the
world
in
which
you
live
no
i
do
but
now
i
am
going
to
try
i
am
going
to
see
if
i
can
make
out
who
is
right
the
world
or
i
you
are
ill
nora
you
are
delirious
i
almost
think
you
are
out
of
your
mind
i
have
never
felt
my
mind
so
clear
and
certain
as
and
is
it
with
a
clear
and
certain
mind
that
you
forsake
your
husband
and
your
children
yes
it
is
then
there
is
only
one
possible
explanation
what
is
that
you
do
not
love
me
any
more
no
that
is
just
it
nora
and
you
can
say
that
it
gives
me
great
pain
torvald
for
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
do
not
love
you
any
more
his
is
that
a
clear
and
certain
conviction
too
yes
absolutely
clear
and
certain
that
is
the
reason
why
i
will
not
stay
here
any
longer
and
can
you
tell
me
what
i
have
done
to
forfeit
your
love
yes
indeed
i
can
it
was
when
the
wonderful
thing
did
not
happen
then
i
saw
you
were
not
the
man
i
had
thought
you
explain
yourself
better
i
do
understand
you
i
have
waited
so
patiently
for
eight
years
for
goodness
knows
i
knew
very
well
that
wonderful
things
do
happen
every
day
then
this
horrible
misfortune
came
upon
me
and
then
i
felt
quite
certain
that
the
wonderful
thing
was
going
to
happen
at
last
when
krogstad
letter
was
lying
out
there
never
for
a
moment
did
i
imagine
that
you
would
consent
to
accept
this
man
conditions
i
was
so
absolutely
certain
that
you
would
say
to
him
publish
the
thing
to
the
whole
world
and
when
that
was
done
yes
what
then
when
i
had
exposed
my
wife
to
shame
and
disgrace
when
that
was
done
i
was
so
absolutely
certain
you
would
come
forward
and
take
everything
upon
yourself
and
say
i
am
the
guilty
one
nora
you
mean
that
i
would
never
have
accepted
such
a
sacrifice
on
your
part
no
of
course
not
but
what
would
my
assurances
have
been
worth
against
yours
that
was
the
wonderful
thing
which
i
hoped
for
and
feared
and
it
was
to
prevent
that
that
i
wanted
to
kill
myself
i
would
gladly
work
night
and
day
for
you
nora
bear
sorrow
and
want
for
your
sake
but
no
man
would
sacrifice
his
honour
for
the
one
he
loves
it
is
a
thing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
have
done
oh
you
think
and
talk
like
a
heedless
child
maybe
but
you
neither
think
nor
talk
like
the
man
i
could
bind
myself
to
as
soon
as
your
fear
was
over
and
it
was
not
fear
for
what
threatened
me
but
for
what
might
happen
to
you
when
the
whole
thing
was
past
as
far
as
you
were
concerned
it
was
exactly
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
exactly
as
before
i
was
your
little
skylark
your
doll
which
you
would
in
future
treat
with
doubly
gentle
care
because
it
was
so
brittle
and
fragile
torvald
it
was
then
it
dawned
upon
me
that
for
eight
years
i
had
been
living
here
with
a
strange
man
and
had
borne
him
three
children
oh
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
i
could
tear
myself
into
little
bits
i
see
i
see
an
abyss
has
opened
between
us
there
is
no
denying
it
but
nora
would
it
not
be
possible
to
fill
it
up
as
i
am
now
i
am
no
wife
for
you
i
have
it
in
me
to
become
a
different
man
perhaps
if
your
doll
is
taken
away
from
you
but
to
part
to
part
from
you
no
no
nora
i
understand
that
idea
out
to
the
that
makes
it
all
the
more
certain
that
it
must
be
done
comes
back
with
her
cloak
and
hat
and
a
small
bag
which
she
puts
on
a
chair

the
nora

till
tomorrow

can
not

night
in
a
strange
man
room

here

know
very
well

would
not
last
long

shawl
round
torvald
i
wo
see
the
little
ones

know
they
are
in
better
hands
than
mine
as
i
am
now
i
can
be
of
no
use
to
them
but
some
day
nora
some
day
how
can
i
tell
i
have
no
idea
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
but
you
are
my
wife
whatever
becomes
of
you
listen
torvald

have
heard
that
when
a
wife
deserts
her
husband
house
as
i
am
doing
now
he
is
legally
freed
from
all
obligations
towards
her
in
any
case

set
you
free
from
all
your
obligations

are
not
to
feel
yourself
bound
in
the
slightest
way

more
than
i
shall

both
sides

over

over

of
me
again

of

more
than
a
stranger
to
you

most
wonderful
thing
of
all
would
have
to
happen

me
what
that
would
be
both

and
i
would
have
to
be
so
changed
that

do
believe
any
longer
in
wonderful
things
happening
but
i
will
believe
in
it

so
changed

that
our
life
together
would
be
a
real
wedlock

wonderful
thing
