introduction
honoré
de
balzac
balzac
short
stories
which
we
call
in
french
are
generally
speaking
not
the
or
the
most
popular
part
of
his
work
nor
are
they
the
part
best
fitted
to
give
a
true
and
complete
idea
of
his
genius
but
some
of
them
are
none
the
less
masterpieces
in
their
kind
they
have
characteristics
and
a
significance
not
always
possessed
by
their
author
long
novels
such
as
or
pons
and
finally
for
this
very
reason
they
hold
in
the
unfinished
structure
of
human
a
place
which
it
will
be
interesting
to
try
to
determine
that
is
all
that
will
be
attempted
in
this
introduction
some
of
the
stories
contained
in
the
present
volume
were
written
under
curious
circumstances
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
noted
that
they
all
date
from
and
and
therefore
precede
the
conception
and
planning
of
human
their
value
is
far
from
being
diminished
by
that
fact
episode
under
the
for
instance
was
composed
as
an
introduction
to
the
of
sanson
that
executioner
who
of
all
executioners
in
the
history
probably
despatched
the
fewest
criminals
and
yet
shed
the
most
blood
and
the
themselves
which
are
entirely
apocryphal
are
also
in
part
balzac
own
work
but
though
composed
in
this
way
to
order
and
as
a
piece
of
hack
work
episode
under
the
is
in
its
artistic
brevity
one
of
balzac
most
tragic
and
most
finished
narratives
grande
was
at
first
only
an
episode
inserted
among
the
more
extended
narratives
of
which
it
made
part
as
in
the
novel
of
tales
within
tales
of
which
is
the
type
and
brief
as
it
is
balzac
nevertheless
rewrote
it
three
or
four
times
it
is
therefore
anything
but
an
improvisation
yet
no
other
of
these
short
stories
can
give
more
vividly
than
grande
the
impression
of
a
work
sprung
at
once
in
full
completeness
from
its
author
brain
and
conceived
from
the
very
first
in
its
indivisible
unity
but
precisely
it
is
one
of
the
characteristic
traits
of
balzac
genius
that
we
hardly
need
to
know
when
or
for
what
purpose
he
wrote
this
or
that
one
of
his
novels
or
stories
he
bore
them
all
within
him
at
once
we
might
say
that
the
germ
of
them
was
preëxistent
in
him
before
he
had
any
conscious
thought
of
objectivising
them
his
characters
were
born
in
him
as
though
from
all
eternity
before
he
knew
them
himself
and
before
he
himself
suspected
it
human
was
alive
was
confusedly
moving
was
slowly
shaping
itself
in
his
brain
this
point
must
be
clearly
seen
before
he
can
be
understood
or
appreciated
at
his
true
value
however
much
interest
a
monograph
on
some
animal
or
plant
may
have
in
itself
and
that
interest
no
doubt
is
often
great
it
has
far
more
through
the
relations
it
bears
to
other
monographs
and
to
the
whole
field
of
knowledge
of
which
its
subject
is
only
a
fragmentary
part
so
it
is
with
balzac
novels
and
stories
their
interest
is
not
limited
to
themselves
they
bring
out
one
another
value
and
significance
they
illustrate
and
give
importance
to
each
other
they
have
outside
themselves
a
justification
for
existence
this
will
become
clear
if
we
compare
mérimée
for
instance
with
seashore
the
subject
is
the
same
in
each
case
it
is
a
father
who
constitutes
himself
justiciary
of
the
honour
of
his
race
but
while
mérimée
work
though
perhaps
better
written
or
at
least
engraved
with
deeper
tooling
is
after
all
nothing
but
an
anecdote
a
sensational
a
story
of
local
manners
balzac
is
bound
up
with
a
whole
mass
of
ideas
not
to
say
a
whole
social
philosophy
of
which
it
is
properly
speaking
only
a
and
of
which
is
another
but
why
did
balzac
confine
some
of
his
subjects
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
while
he
expanded
others
to
the
dimensions
of
epic
we
might
say
or
of
history
it
was
because
though
analogies
are
numerous
between
natural
history
and
what
we
may
call
social
history
or
the
natural
history
of
society
yet
their
resemblance
is
not
complete
nor
their
identity
absolute
there
are
peculiarities
or
variations
of
passion
which
though
physiologically
or
pathologically
interesting
are
insignificant
and
can
be
left
out
of
account
for
instance
passion
in
the
or
unknown
it
is
rare
in
art
for
the
passionate
pursuit
of
progress
to
result
only
as
with
frenhofer
in
jumbling
the
colours
on
a
great
painter
canvas
and
even
were
this
less
rare
artists
are
not
very
numerous
so
if
the
writer
gave
to
his
narrative
of
this
painful
but
infrequent
adventure
as
full
a
development
if
he
diversified
and
complicated
it
with
as
many
episodes
and
details
as
the
adventures
of
baron
hulot
in
or
those
of
madame
de
mortsauf
in
lily
in
the
he
would
thereby
attribute
to
it
or
an
importance
it
does
not
possess
he
would
err
and
would
make
us
err
with
him
regarding
the
true
proportions
of
things
he
would
represent
the
humanity
which
he
was
attempting
to
depict
in
a
manner
far
from
consistent
with
reality
hence
may
be
deduced
the
æsthetics
of
the
and
its
distinction
from
the
and
also
from
the
or
novel
the
differs
from
the
in
that
it
always
claims
to
be
a
picture
of
ordinary
life
and
it
differs
from
the
novel
in
that
it
selects
from
ordinary
life
and
depicts
by
preference
and
almost
exclusively
those
examples
of
the
strange
the
rare
and
the
extraordinary
which
ordinary
life
does
in
spite
of
its
monotony
nevertheless
contain
it
is
neither
strange
nor
rare
for
a
miser
to
make
all
the
people
about
him
including
his
wife
and
children
victims
of
the
passion
to
which
he
is
himself
enslaved
and
that
is
the
subject
of
it
is
nothing
extraordinary
for
parents
of
humble
origin
to
be
almost
disowned
by
their
children
whom
they
have
married
too
far
above
them
in
another
class
of
society
and
that
is
the
subject
of
but
for
a
husband
as
in
grande
to
wall
up
his
wife
lover
in
a
closet
and
that
before
her
very
eyes
and
through
a
combination
of
circumstances
in
themselves
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
for
neither
one
of
them
to
dare
or
be
able
to
make
any
defence
against
his
vengeance
this
is
certainly
somewhat
rare
then
read
or
episode
under
the
terror
the
plot
is
no
ordinary
one
and
perhaps
with
a
little
exaggeration
we
may
say
it
can
have
occurred
but
once
such
then
is
the
field
of
the
let
us
set
off
from
it
the
fantastic
in
the
style
of
hoffmann
or
edgar
allan
poe
even
though
balzac
sometimes
tried
that
also
as
in
wild
ass
for
instance
or
in
converted
for
the
fantastic
belongs
to
the
field
of
the
but
unusual
events
especially
such
as
result
from
an
unforeseen
combination
of
circumstances
and
really
tragic
adventures
which
like
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
in
grande
or
in
seashore
make
human
conscience
hesitate
to
call
the
crime
by
its
name
and
illogical
variations
deviations
or
perversions
of
passion
and
the
pathology
of
feeling
as
in
unknown
masterpiece
and
still
more
generally
if
i
may
so
express
myself
all
those
things
in
life
which
are
out
of
the
usual
run
of
life
which
happen
its
and
so
are
beside
yet
not
outside
it
all
that
makes
its
surprises
its
differences
its
so
to
speak
all
this
is
the
province
of
the
bordering
on
that
of
the
novel
yet
distinct
from
it
out
of
common
life
you
can
not
really
make
but
only
novels
miniature
novels
when
they
are
brief
but
still
novels
in
no
french
writer
of
the
last
century
i
think
is
this
distinction
more
evident
or
more
strictly
observed
than
it
is
in
human
comedy
and
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
this
may
serve
to
solve
or
at
least
to
throw
light
on
the
vexed
question
of
honoré
de
balzac
or
in
the
literal
and
even
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
that
is
without
taking
account
of
the
way
in
which
émile
zola
and
some
other
italians
have
its
no
one
can
question
that
balzac
was
a
naturalist
one
might
as
well
deny
that
victor
hugo
was
a
romanticist
everybody
knows
that
neither
the
freedom
of
his
vocabulary
nor
some
very
detailed
descriptions
in
dame
de
and
especially
in
nor
his
coarse
popular
jokes
often
in
doubtful
taste
if
not
sometimes
worse
nor
yet
the
interest
in
social
questions
which
characterised
him
from
the
very
first
that
nothing
of
all
this
i
say
prevents
victor
hugo
from
having
been
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
romanticist
we
may
rest
assured
that
in
whatever
way
romanticism
shall
be
defined
he
will
always
be
in
the
history
of
french
literature
its
living
incarnation
balzac
on
the
other
hand
will
always
be
the
living
incarnation
of
naturalism
and
surely
if
to
be
a
naturalist
is
to
confine
the
field
of
one
art
to
the
observation
of
contemporary
life
and
to
try
to
give
a
complete
and
adequate
representation
thereof
not
drawing
back
or
hesitating
not
abating
one
tittle
of
the
truth
in
the
depiction
of
ugliness
and
vice
if
to
be
a
naturalist
is
like
a
to
subordinate
every
æsthetic
and
moral
consideration
to
the
law
of
likeness
then
it
is
impossible
to
be
more
of
a
naturalist
than
balzac
but
with
all
this
since
his
imagination
is
unruly
capricious
changeable
with
a
strong
tendency
to
exaggeration
audacious
and
corrupt
since
he
as
much
as
any
of
his
contemporaries
feels
the
need
of
startling
us
since
he
habitually
writes
under
the
dominion
of
a
kind
of
hallucinatory
fever
sufficient
of
itself
to
mark
what
we
may
call
the
romantic
state
of
mind
romanticism
is
certainly
not
absent
from
the
work
of
this
naturalist
but
on
the
contrary
would
fill
and
inspire
the
whole
of
it
were
that
result
not
prevented
by
the
claims
or
conditions
of
observation
a
romantic
imagination
struggling
to
triumph
over
itself
and
succeeding
only
by
confining
itself
to
the
study
of
the
model
such
may
be
the
definition
of
balzac
imagination
or
genius
and
in
a
way
to
justify
this
definition
by
his
work
we
need
only
to
distinguish
clearly
his
from
his
novels
balzac
represent
the
share
of
romanticism
in
his
work
grande
is
the
typical
romantic
narrative
and
we
may
say
as
much
of
unknown
the
observer
shuts
his
eyes
he
now
looks
only
within
himself
he
imagines
what
might
have
been
and
he
writes
episode
under
the
it
is
for
him
a
way
of
escape
from
the
obsession
of
the
real
the
real
is
strait
the
possible
is
vast
his
unbridled
imagination
takes
free
course
he
works
in
dream
and
since
of
course
we
can
never
succeed
in
building
within
ourselves
perfectly
compartments
entirely
separating
dream
from
memory
and
imagination
from
observation
reality
does
find
its
way
into
his
by
way
of
exactness
in
detail
but
their
conception
remains
essentially
or
chiefly
romantic
just
as
in
his
long
novels
grandet
a
bachelor
establishment
un
ménage
de
garçon
césar
birotteau
a
dark
affair
cousin
and
his
observation
remains
naturalistic
and
his
imagination
perverts
it
by
magnifying
or
exaggerating
yet
never
intentionally
or
systematically
or
to
the
extent
of
falsifying
the
true
relations
of
things
shall
i
dare
say
to
english
readers
that
by
this
fact
he
belongs
to
the
family
of
shakespeare
his
long
novels
are
his
his
his
his
and
and
his
his
short
stories
are
his
his
and
his
night
this
comparison
which
really
is
not
a
comparison
but
a
mere
analogy
such
as
might
be
drawn
between
musset
and
byron
may
serve
to
bring
out
one
more
characteristic
of
balzac
they
are
philosophic
in
his
human
it
is
under
the
title
of
that
he
brought
together
whatever
their
origin
such
stories
as
seashore
drama
the
unknown
and
even
by
so
doing
he
no
doubt
meant
to
imply
that
the
sensational
stories
on
which
they
are
based
did
not
contain
their
whole
significance
that
he
was
using
them
merely
as
a
means
of
stating
a
problem
of
fixing
the
reader
attention
for
a
moment
on
the
vastness
of
the
mysterious
or
unknown
by
which
we
are
so
to
speak
enwrapped
about
we
might
add
this
tragic
story
he
writes
at
the
end
of
his
to
the
mass
of
other
observations
on
that
sympathy
which
defies
the
law
of
space
a
body
of
evidence
which
some
few
solitary
scholars
are
collecting
with
scientific
curiosity
and
which
will
one
day
serve
as
basis
for
a
new
science
a
science
which
till
now
has
lacked
only
its
man
of
genius
these
are
large
words
it
would
seem
with
which
to
point
the
moral
of
a
mere
historical
anecdote
but
if
we
consider
them
well
we
shall
see
that
whatever
we
may
think
of
this
new
science
balzac
wrote
his
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ending
it
with
that
sentence
read
too
seashore
it
is
often
said
that
a
fact
is
a
fact
and
i
scarcely
know
a
more
futile
sophism
unless
it
be
the
one
which
consists
in
saying
that
of
tastes
and
colours
there
is
no
disputing
such
is
not
opinion
at
any
rate
he
believes
that
a
fact
is
more
than
a
fact
that
it
is
the
expression
or
manifestation
of
something
other
or
more
than
itself
or
again
that
it
is
a
piece
of
evidence
a
which
it
is
not
enough
to
have
put
on
record
but
in
which
we
must
also
seek
through
contrasts
and
resemblances
its
deep
ulterior
meaning
and
this
is
what
he
has
tried
to
show
in
his
thus
we
see
what
place
they
hold
in
his
human
short
stories
are
not
in
his
work
what
one
might
be
tempted
to
call
somewhat
disdainfully
the
chips
of
his
workshop
nor
are
they
even
in
relation
to
his
long
novels
what
a
painter
sketches
rough
drafts
and
studies
are
to
his
finished
pictures
he
did
not
write
them
by
way
of
practice
or
experiment
they
have
their
own
value
intrinsic
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
also
to
consider
them
as
little
novels
in
briefer
form
which
more
time
or
leisure
might
have
allowed
their
author
to
treat
with
more
fullness
he
conceived
them
for
their
own
sake
he
would
never
have
consented
to
give
them
proportions
which
did
not
befit
them
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
by
reason
of
their
dealing
with
the
exceptional
or
extraordinary
they
are
in
a
way
the
element
of
in
balzac
and
by
reason
of
their
philosophic
or
symbolic
significance
they
add
the
element
of
mystery
to
a
work
which
but
for
them
would
be
somewhat
harshly
illumined
by
the
hard
light
of
reality
once
more
that
is
why
he
did
not
classify
his
with
the
of
political
or
his
seashore
with
the
of
country
that
too
is
what
gives
them
their
interest
and
their
originality
that
is
what
distinguishes
them
from
the
stories
of
prosper
mérimée
or
later
those
of
guy
de
maupassant
so
much
being
made
clear
it
is
not
important
now
to
ask
whether
they
really
have
as
much
depth
of
meaning
as
their
author
claimed
for
them
that
is
another
question
and
i
have
just
indicated
why
i
can
not
treat
it
in
this
brief
introduction
only
in
a
complete
study
of
balzac
could
his
be
adequately
judged
then
their
due
place
would
be
assigned
to
them
in
the
full
scheme
of
human
i
shall
be
happy
if
the
english
reader
remembers
this
and
if
the
reading
of
these
after
having
for
a
moment
charmed
him
shall
also
inspire
him
with
the
wish
to
know
more
closely
and
completely
the
greatest
of
french
novelists

according

first
published
in
the
fourth
edition
of
the
in
but
this
fact
in
no
wise
lessens
the
force
of
ed
the
unknown
masterpiece
to
a
lord
i
gillette
late
in
the
year
one
cold
morning
in
december
a
young
man
whose
garments
seemed
very
thin
was
walking
before
the
door
of
a
house
on
rue
des
paris
after
pacing
that
street
for
a
long
time
with
the
indecision
of
a
lover
who
dares
not
pay
a
visit
to
his
first
mistress
however
kind
she
may
be
he
at
last
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
asked
if
master
françois
porbus
was
at
home
upon
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
from
a
woman
who
was
sweeping
a
room
on
the
lower
floor
the
young
man
went
slowly
hesitating
from
stair
to
stair
like
a
courtier
of
recent
creation
apprehensive
of
the
greeting
which
he
was
to
receive
from
the
king
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
winding
staircase
he
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
landing
uncertain
whether
he
should
lift
the
grotesque
knocker
affixed
to
the
door
of
the
studio
where
the
painter
of
henri
cast
aside
for
rubens
by
marie
de
medici
was
doubtless
at
work
the
young
man
felt
that
profound
emotion
which
must
cause
the
hearts
of
all
great
artists
to
beat
quickly
when
in
the
prime
of
youth
and
of
their
love
for
art
they
approach
a
man
of
genius
or
some
noble
masterpiece
there
exists
in
all
human
sentiments
a
primitive
flower
engendered
by
a
noble
enthusiasm
which
grows
constantly
weaker
and
weaker
until
happiness
ceases
to
be
more
than
a
memory
and
glory
more
than
a
lie
among
these
transitory
sentiments
nothing
bears
so
close
a
resemblance
to
love
as
the
youthful
passion
of
an
artist
just
beginning
to
experience
the
delicious
torture
of
his
destiny
of
renown
and
of
misfortune
a
passion
full
of
audacity
and
shyness
of
vague
beliefs
and
of
certain
discouragement
the
youthful
genius
with
empty
pockets
whose
heart
has
not
throbbed
upon
appearing
before
a
master
will
always
lack
one
chord
in
his
heart
some
indefinable
touch
of
the
brush
some
feeling
in
his
work
some
shade
of
poetical
expression
if
some
boasters
puffed
out
with
conceit
believe
too
early
in
the
future
they
are
considered
people
of
intellect
by
fools
alone
in
this
regard
the
young
stranger
seemed
to
possess
real
merit
if
talent
is
to
be
measured
by
that
early
timidity
that
indescribable
modesty
which
people
destined
to
glory
gradually
lose
in
the
exercise
of
their
art
as
pretty
women
lose
theirs
in
the
manoeuvring
of
coquetry
the
habitude
of
triumph
lessens
doubt
and
modesty
perhaps
is
a
form
of
doubt
overwhelmed
by
surprise
and
distress
at
that
moment
of
his
overweening
presumption
the
poor
neophyte
would
not
have
entered
the
studio
of
the
painter
to
whom
we
owe
the
admirable
portrait
of
henri
except
for
an
extraordinary
reinforcement
sent
him
by
chance
an
old
man
ascended
the
stairs
from
the
oddity
of
his
costume
the
magnificence
of
his
lace
ruff
the
ponderous
of
his
gait
the
young
man
divined
that
he
was
either
the
painter
patron
or
his
friend
he
drew
back
against
the
wall
to
make
room
for
him
and
gazed
at
him
curiously
hoping
to
find
in
him
the
kindly
nature
of
an
artist
or
the
obliging
disposition
of
those
who
love
art
but
he
detected
something
diabolical
in
that
face
and
above
all
that
indefinable
expression
which
artists
dote
upon
imagine
a
bald
prominent
even
protuberant
forehead
overshadowing
a
small
flattened
nose
turned
up
at
the
end
like
rabelais
or
socrates
a
smiling
mouth
wrinkled
at
the
corners
a
short
chin
proudly
raised
and
adorned
with
a
gray
beard
trimmed
to
a
point
eyes
apparently
dulled
by
age
which
however
by
virtue
of
the
contrast
of
the
in
which
the
pupils
swam
sometimes
emitted
magnetic
glances
under
the
spur
of
wrath
or
enthusiasm
the
face
was
woefully
ravaged
by
the
fatigues
of
age
and
even
more
by
the
thoughts
which
tire
mind
and
body
alike
the
eyes
had
no
lashes
and
one
could
barely
detect
a
trace
of
eyebrows
over
their
protruding
arches
place
that
head
upon
a
slender
and
fragile
body
surround
it
with
a
lace
ruff
of
snowy
whiteness
and
of
a
pattern
as
elaborate
as
that
of
a
silver
throw
a
heavy
gold
chain
over
the
old
man
black
doublet
and
you
will
have
an
imperfect
image
of
that
individual
to
whom
the
dim
light
of
the
hall
imparted
an
even
stranger
colouring
you
would
have
said
that
it
was
one
of
rembrandt
canvases
walking
silently
without
a
frame
through
the
dark
atmosphere
which
that
great
painter
made
his
own
the
old
man
cast
a
sagacious
glance
at
the
young
one
tapped
thrice
on
the
door
and
said
to
a
personage
of
about
forty
years
who
opened
it
good
morning
master
porbus
bowed
respectfully
he
admitted
the
young
man
thinking
that
he
had
come
with
the
other
and
paid
the
less
heed
to
him
because
the
neophyte
was
evidently
under
the
spell
which
a
born
painter
inevitably
experiences
at
the
aspect
of
the
first
studio
that
he
sees
where
some
of
the
material
processes
of
art
are
revealed
to
him
a
window
in
the
ceiling
lighted
master
porbus
studio
the
light
concentrated
upon
a
canvas
standing
on
the
easel
which
as
yet
bore
only
a
few
light
strokes
did
not
reach
the
dark
recesses
in
the
corners
of
that
enormous
room
but
a
few
stray
gleams
lighted
up
the
silver
in
the
centre
of
a
cavalryman
cuirass
hanging
on
the
wall
in
the
ruddy
shadow
illuminated
with
a
sudden
beam
the
carved
and
polished
cornice
of
an
sideboard
laden
with
curious
vessels
or
studded
with
dazzling
points
of
light
the
rough
woof
of
certain
old
curtains
of
gold
brocade
with
broad
irregular
folds
scattered
about
as
drapery
plaster
casts
busts
and
fragments
of
antique
goddesses
fondly
polished
by
the
kisses
of
centuries
lay
about
upon
tables
and
consoles
innumerable
sketches
studies
in
coloured
chalk
in
red
lead
or
in
pen
and
ink
covered
the
walls
to
the
ceiling
boxes
of
colours
bottles
of
oil
and
of
essences
and
overturned
stools
left
only
a
narrow
path
to
the
sort
of
halo
projected
by
the
high
window
through
which
the
light
fell
full
upon
porbus
pale
face
and
upon
the
ivory
skull
of
his
strange
visitor
the
young
man
attention
was
soon
exclusively
absorbed
by
a
picture
which
had
already
become
famous
even
in
that
epoch
of
commotion
and
revolution
and
which
was
visited
by
some
of
those
obstinate
enthusiasts
to
whom
we
owe
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
during
evil
days
that
beautiful
canvas
represented
mary
the
preparing
to
pay
for
her
passage
in
the
boat
that
masterpiece
painted
for
marie
de
medici
was
sold
by
her
in
the
days
of
her
destitution
i
like
your
saint
the
old
man
said
to
porbus
and
i
would
give
you
ten
golden
crowns
above
the
price
that
the
queen
is
to
pay
but
meddle
in
her
preserves
the
deuce
you
think
it
is
well
done
do
you
hum
said
the
old
man
well
done
yes
and
no
your
saint
is
not
badly
put
together
but
she
is
not
alive
you
fellows
think
that
you
have
done
everything
when
you
have
drawn
a
figure
correctly
and
put
everything
in
its
place
according
to
the
laws
of
anatomy
you
colour
this
feature
with
a
prepared
beforehand
on
your
palette
taking
care
to
keep
one
side
darker
than
the
other
and
because
you
glance
from
time
to
time
at
a
nude
woman
standing
on
a
table
you
think
that
you
have
copied
nature
you
imagine
that
you
are
painters
and
that
you
have
discovered
god
secret
bah
to
be
a
great
poet
it
is
not
enough
to
know
syntax
and
to
avoid
errors
in
grammar
look
at
your
saint
porbus
at
first
glance
she
seems
admirable
but
at
the
second
one
sees
that
she
is
glued
to
the
canvas
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
walk
about
her
body
she
is
a
silhouette
with
but
a
single
face
a
figure
cut
out
of
canvas
an
image
that
can
neither
turn
nor
change
its
position
i
am
not
conscious
of
the
air
between
that
arm
and
the
background
of
the
picture
space
and
depth
are
lacking
however
everything
is
right
so
far
as
perspective
is
concerned
and
the
gradation
of
light
and
shade
is
scrupulously
observed
but
despite
such
efforts
i
am
unable
to
believe
that
that
beautiful
body
is
animated
with
the
warm
breath
of
life
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
should
put
my
hand
upon
that
firm
round
breast
i
should
find
it
as
cold
as
marble
no
my
friend
the
blood
does
not
flow
beneath
that
ivory
skin
life
does
not
swell
with
its
purple
dew
the
veins
and
fibres
which
intertwine
like
network
beneath
the
transparent
temples
and
breast
this
place
throbs
with
life
but
that
other
place
is
motionless
life
and
death
contend
in
every
detail
here
it
is
a
woman
there
a
statue
and
there
a
corpse
your
creation
is
incomplete
you
have
been
able
to
breathe
only
a
portion
of
your
soul
into
your
cherished
work
the
torch
of
prometheus
has
gone
out
more
than
once
in
your
hands
and
many
parts
of
your
picture
have
not
been
touched
by
the
celestial
flame
but
why
my
dear
master
porbus
respectfully
asked
the
old
man
while
the
young
man
had
difficulty
in
repressing
a
savage
desire
to
strike
him
ah
it
is
this
way
replied
the
little
old
man
you
have
wavered
irresolutely
between
the
two
systems
between
drawing
and
colour
between
the
phlegmatic
minuteness
the
stiff
precision
of
the
old
german
masters
and
the
dazzling
ardour
and
happy
plenitude
of
the
italian
painters
you
have
tried
to
imitate
at
the
same
time
hans
holbein
and
titian
albert
dürer
and
paul
veronese
assuredly
that
was
a
noble
ambition
but
what
has
happened
you
have
achieved
neither
the
severe
charm
of
precision
nor
the
deceitful
magic
of
the
chiaroscuro
in
this
spot
like
melted
bronze
which
bursts
its
too
fragile
mould
the
rich
light
colouring
of
titian
brings
out
too
prominently
the
meagre
outlines
of
albert
dürer
in
which
you
moulded
it
elsewhere
the
features
have
resisted
and
held
in
check
the
superb
polish
of
the
venetian
palette
your
face
is
neither
perfectly
drawn
nor
perfectly
painted
and
bears
everywhere
the
traces
of
that
unfortunate
indecision
if
you
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
melt
together
in
the
flame
of
your
genius
the
two
rival
systems
you
should
have
chosen
frankly
one
or
the
other
in
order
to
obtain
the
unity
which
represents
one
of
the
conditions
of
life
you
are
accurate
only
in
the
surroundings
your
outlines
are
false
do
not
envelop
each
other
and
give
no
promise
of
anything
behind
there
is
a
touch
of
truth
here
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
the
saint
breast
and
here
he
added
indicating
the
point
where
the
shoulder
came
to
an
end
but
here
he
said
reverting
to
the
middle
of
the
throat
all
is
false
let
us
not
attempt
to
analyse
anything
it
would
drive
you
to
despair
the
old
man
seated
himself
on
a
stool
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
said
no
more
master
said
porbus
i
studied
that
throat
very
carefully
in
the
nude
figure
but
unfortunately
for
us
there
are
true
effects
in
nature
which
seem
improbable
upon
canvas
the
mission
of
art
is
not
to
copy
nature
but
to
express
it
you
are
not
a
vile
copyist
but
a
poet
cried
the
old
man
hastily
interrupting
porbus
with
an
imperious
gesture
otherwise
a
sculptor
would
reach
the
end
of
his
labours
by
moulding
a
woman
but
try
to
mould
your
mistress
hand
and
to
place
it
before
you
you
will
find
a
horrible
dead
thing
without
any
resemblance
and
you
will
be
obliged
to
resort
to
the
chisel
of
the
man
who
without
copying
it
exactly
will
impart
motion
and
life
to
it
we
have
to
grasp
the
spirit
the
soul
the
physiognomy
of
things
and
of
creatures
effects
effects
why
they
are
the
accidents
of
life
and
not
life
itself
a
hand
as
i
have
taken
that
example
a
hand
does
not
simply
belong
to
the
body
it
expresses
and
carries
out
a
thought
which
you
must
grasp
and
represent
neither
the
painter
nor
the
poet
nor
the
sculptor
should
separate
the
effect
from
the
cause
for
they
are
inseparably
connected
the
real
struggle
is
there
many
painters
triumph
by
instinct
without
realising
this
axiom
of
art
you
draw
a
woman
but
you
do
not
see
her
that
is
not
the
way
that
one
succeeds
in
forcing
the
secrets
of
nature
your
hand
reproduces
without
your
knowledge
the
model
that
you
have
copied
at
your
master
studio
you
do
not
go
down
sufficiently
into
the
inmost
details
of
form
you
do
not
pursue
it
with
enough
enthusiasm
and
perseverance
in
its
windings
and
its
flights
beauty
is
a
stern
and
exacting
thing
which
does
not
allow
itself
to
be
caught
so
easily
we
must
await
its
pleasure
watch
for
it
seize
it
and
embrace
it
closely
in
order
to
compel
it
to
surrender
form
is
a
proteus
much
more
difficult
to
seize
and
more
fertile
in
evasions
than
the
proteus
of
fable
only
after
long
struggles
can
one
compel
it
to
show
itself
in
its
real
guise
you
are
content
with
the
first
aspect
under
which
it
appears
to
you
or
at
most
with
the
second
or
third
that
is
not
true
of
the
victorious
fighters
the
invincible
painters
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
deceived
by
all
these
subterfuges
they
persevere
until
nature
is
reduced
to
the
point
where
she
must
stand
forth
naked
and
in
her
real
shape
that
was
the
process
adopted
by
raphael
said
the
old
man
removing
his
black
velvet
cap
to
express
the
respect
inspired
by
the
king
of
art
his
great
superiority
comes
from
the
secret
perception
which
in
him
seems
determined
to
shatter
form
in
his
figures
form
is
what
it
really
is
in
us
an
interpreter
for
the
communication
of
ideas
and
sensations
a
vast
poetic
conception
every
figure
is
a
world
a
portrait
whose
model
has
appeared
in
a
sublime
vision
tinged
with
light
indicated
by
an
inward
voice
disrobed
by
a
divine
figure
which
points
out
the
sources
of
expression
in
the
past
of
a
whole
life
you
give
your
women
lovely
robes
of
flesh
lovely
draperies
of
hair
but
where
is
the
blood
which
engenders
tranquillity
or
passion
and
which
causes
special
effects
your
saint
is
a
dark
woman
but
this
one
my
poor
porbus
is
a
blonde
your
figures
are
pale
coloured
spectres
which
you
parade
before
our
eyes
and
you
call
that
painting
and
art
because
you
have
made
something
which
looks
more
like
a
woman
than
like
a
house
you
think
that
you
have
attained
your
end
and
overjoyed
because
you
no
longer
have
to
write
beside
your
figures
or
like
the
first
painters
you
fancy
that
you
are
marvellous
artists
ah
no
you
are
not
that
yet
my
good
fellows
you
will
have
to
use
up
more
pencils
and
cover
many
canvases
before
you
reach
that
point
to
be
sure
a
woman
carries
her
head
like
that
she
wears
her
skirts
as
this
one
does
her
eyes
languish
and
melt
with
that
air
of
mild
resignation
the
quivering
shadow
of
the
eyelashes
trembles
thus
upon
her
cheek
that
is
accurate
and
it
is
not
accurate
what
does
it
lack
a
mere
nothing
but
that
nothing
is
everything
you
produce
the
appearance
of
life
but
you
do
not
express
its
overflow
that
indefinable
something
which
perhaps
is
the
soul
and
which
floats
upon
the
outer
envelope
in
a
word
that
flower
of
life
which
titian
and
raphael
discovered
starting
from
the
farthest
point
that
you
have
reached
an
excellent
painting
might
perhaps
be
executed
but
you
grow
weary
too
soon
the
common
herd
admires
but
the
connoisseur
smiles
o
mabuse
o
my
master
added
this
extraordinary
individual
you
are
a
thief
you
carried
life
away
with
you
however
he
continued
this
canvas
is
worth
more
than
the
painting
of
that
mountebank
of
a
rubens
with
his
mountains
of
flemish
flesh
powdered
with
vermillion
his
waves
of
red
hair
and
his
wilderness
of
colours
at
all
events
you
have
here
colouring
drawing
and
sentiment
the
three
essential
parts
of
art
but
that
saint
is
sublime
my
good
man
cried
the
young
man
in
a
loud
voice
emerging
from
a
profound
reverie
those
two
figures
of
the
saint
and
the
boatman
have
a
delicacy
of
expression
utterly
unknown
to
the
italian
painters
i
do
know
a
single
one
of
them
who
could
have
achieved
the
hesitation
of
the
boatman
does
this
little
knave
belong
to
you
porbus
asked
the
old
man
alas
pray
excuse
my
presumption
master
replied
the
neophyte
blushing
i
am
a
stranger
a
dauber
by
instinct
only
lately
arrived
in
this
city
the
source
of
all
knowledge
to
work
said
porbus
handing
him
a
pencil
and
a
sheet
of
paper
in
a
twinkling
the
stranger
copied
the
cried
the
old
man
your
name
the
young
man
wrote
at
the
foot
of
the
drawing
that
is
not
bad
for
a
beginner
said
the
strange
creature
who
harangued
so
wildly
i
see
that
we
can
safely
talk
painting
before
you
i
do
blame
you
for
admiring
porbus
saint
it
is
a
masterpiece
for
the
world
and
only
those
who
are
initiated
in
the
most
profound
secrets
of
art
can
discover
wherein
it
offends
but
since
you
are
worthy
of
the
lesson
and
capable
of
understanding
i
will
show
you
how
little
is
necessary
to
complete
the
work
be
all
eyes
and
all
attention
such
an
opportunity
for
instruction
will
never
occur
again
your
palette
porbus
porbus
went
to
fetch
palette
and
brushes
the
little
old
man
turned
up
his
sleeves
with
a
convulsive
movement
passed
his
thumb
over
the
palette
laden
with
colours
which
porbus
handed
to
him
and
snatched
rather
than
took
from
his
hands
a
handful
of
brushes
of
all
sizes
his
pointed
beard
twitched
with
the
mighty
efforts
that
denoted
the
concupiscence
of
an
amorous
imagination
as
he
dipped
his
brush
in
the
paint
he
grumbled
between
his
teeth
these
colours
are
good
for
nothing
but
to
throw
out
of
the
window
with
the
man
who
made
them
they
are
disgustingly
crude
and
false
how
can
one
paint
with
such
things
then
with
feverish
vivacity
he
dipped
the
point
of
the
brush
in
different
mounds
of
colour
sometimes
running
through
the
entire
scale
more
rapidly
than
a
cathedral
organist
runs
over
his
keyboard
in
playing
the
at
easter
porbus
and
poussin
stood
like
statues
each
on
one
side
of
the
canvas
absorbed
in
the
most
intense
contemplation
you
see
young
man
said
the
old
man
without
turning
you
see
how
by
means
of
three
or
four
touches
and
a
little
blue
varnish
one
can
make
the
air
circulate
around
the
head
of
the
poor
saint
who
surely
must
be
stifling
and
feel
imprisoned
in
that
dense
atmosphere
see
how
that
drapery
flutters
about
now
and
how
readily
one
can
realise
that
the
wind
is
raising
it
formerly
it
looked
like
starched
linen
held
in
place
by
pins
do
you
see
how
perfectly
the
satinlike
gloss
with
which
i
have
touched
the
breast
represents
the
supple
plumpness
of
a
flesh
and
how
the
mixture
of
reddish
brown
and
ochre
warms
the
gray
coldness
of
that
tall
ghost
in
which
the
blood
congealed
instead
of
flowing
young
man
young
man
what
i
am
showing
you
now
no
master
could
teach
you
mabuse
alone
possessed
the
secret
of
imparting
life
to
figures
mabuse
had
but
one
pupil
and
that
was
i
have
had
none
and
i
am
growing
old
you
have
intelligence
enough
to
guess
the
rest
from
this
glimpse
that
i
give
you
while
he
spoke
the
strange
old
man
touched
all
the
parts
of
the
picture
here
two
strokes
of
the
brush
and
there
only
one
but
always
so
opportunely
that
one
would
have
said
that
it
was
a
new
painting
but
a
painting
drenched
with
light
he
worked
with
such
impassioned
zeal
that
the
perspiration
stood
upon
his
high
forehead
he
moved
so
swiftly
with
such
impatient
jerky
little
movements
that
to
young
poussin
it
seemed
as
if
there
must
be
in
that
strange
man
body
a
demon
acting
through
his
hands
and
guiding
them
erratically
against
his
will
the
superhuman
gleam
of
his
eyes
the
convulsions
which
seemed
to
be
the
effect
of
resistance
gave
to
that
idea
a
semblance
of
truth
which
was
certain
to
act
upon
a
youthful
imagination
the
old
man
worked
on
saying
paff
paff
paff
this
is
how
we
do
it
young
man
come
my
little
touches
warm
up
this
frigid
tone
for
me
come
come
pon
pon
pon
he
said
touching
up
the
points
where
he
had
indicated
a
lack
of
life
effacing
by
a
few
daubs
of
paint
the
differences
of
temperament
and
restoring
the
unity
of
tone
which
a
egyptian
demanded
you
see
my
boy
it
is
only
the
last
stroke
of
the
brush
that
counts
porbus
has
given
a
hundred
but
i
give
only
one
nobody
gives
us
credit
for
what
is
underneath
be
sure
to
remember
that
at
last
the
demon
paused
and
turning
to
porbus
and
poussin
who
were
dumb
with
admiration
he
said
to
them
this
does
come
up
to
my
however
a
man
could
afford
to
put
his
name
at
the
foot
of
such
a
work
yes
i
would
sign
it
he
added
rising
and
taking
a
mirror
in
which
he
looked
at
it
now
let
us
go
to
breakfast
he
said
come
to
my
house
both
of
you
i
have
some
smoked
ham
and
some
good
wine
despite
the
evil
times
we
will
talk
painting
we
are
experts
this
little
man
he
added
tapping
nicolas
poussin
on
the
shoulder
has
a
facile
touch
noticing
the
norman
shabby
jacket
at
that
moment
he
took
from
his
belt
a
purse
opened
it
took
out
two
and
said
offering
them
to
him
i
will
buy
your
sketch
take
it
said
porbus
to
poussin
seeing
him
start
and
blush
with
shame
for
the
young
neophyte
had
all
the
pride
of
the
poor
man
take
it
he
has
the
ransom
of
two
kings
in
his
wallet
all
three
went
down
from
the
studio
and
discoursing
on
art
as
they
walked
bent
their
steps
to
a
handsome
wooden
house
near
pont
the
decorations
of
which
the
knocker
the
and
the
arabesques
aroused
poussin
wondering
admiration
the
painter
in
embryo
suddenly
found
himself
in
a
room
on
the
lower
floor
before
a
bright
fire
beside
a
table
laden
with
appetising
dishes
and
by
incredible
good
fortune
in
the
company
of
two
great
artists
overflowing
with
good
nature
young
man
said
porbus
seeing
that
he
stood
in
admiration
before
a
picture
do
look
at
that
canvas
too
closely
or
you
will
be
driven
to
despair
it
was
the
which
mabuse
painted
in
order
to
obtain
his
release
from
the
prison
in
which
his
creditors
kept
him
so
long
in
truth
that
face
was
of
such
startling
reality
that
nicolas
poussin
began
at
that
moment
to
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
old
man
confused
remarks
the
latter
glanced
at
the
picture
with
a
satisfied
expression
but
without
enthusiasm
and
seemed
to
say
i
have
done
better
than
that
there
is
life
in
it
he
said
my
poor
master
surpassed
himself
but
it
still
lacks
a
little
truth
in
the
background
the
man
is
thoroughly
alive
he
is
about
to
rise
and
walk
towards
us
but
the
air
the
sky
the
wind
which
we
breathe
and
see
and
feel
are
not
there
and
then
there
is
only
a
man
now
the
only
man
that
ever
came
forth
from
the
hands
of
god
ought
to
have
something
of
the
divine
which
he
lacks
mabuse
himself
said
so
with
irritation
when
he
was
not
drunk
poussin
glanced
at
the
old
man
and
porbus
in
turn
with
restless
curiosity
he
approached
the
latter
as
if
to
ask
him
the
name
of
their
host
but
the
painter
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
with
a
mysterious
air
and
the
young
man
intensely
interested
kept
silence
hoping
that
sooner
or
later
some
chance
remark
would
enable
him
to
discover
the
name
of
his
host
whose
wealth
and
talent
were
sufficiently
attested
by
the
respect
which
porbus
manifested
for
him
and
by
the
marvellous
things
collected
in
that
room
seeing
a
superb
portrait
of
a
woman
upon
the
oaken
wainscoting
poussin
exclaimed
what
a
beautiful
giorgione
no
replied
the
old
man
you
are
looking
at
one
of
my
first
daubs
then
i
must
be
in
the
house
of
the
god
of
painting
said
poussin
ingenuously
the
old
man
smiled
like
one
long
familiar
with
such
praise
master
frenhofer
said
porbus
could
you
send
for
a
little
of
your
fine
rhine
wine
for
me
two
casks
replied
the
old
man
one
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
which
i
enjoyed
this
morning
in
seeing
your
pretty
sinner
and
the
other
as
a
friendly
gift
ah
if
i
were
not
always
ill
rejoined
porbus
and
if
you
would
let
me
see
your
i
might
be
able
to
paint
a
picture
high
and
wide
and
deep
in
which
the
figures
would
be
show
my
work
cried
the
old
man
intensely
excited
no
no
i
still
have
to
perfect
it
yesterday
towards
night
he
said
i
thought
that
it
was
finished
the
eyes
seemed
to
me
moist
the
flesh
quivered
the
tresses
of
the
hair
moved
it
breathed
although
i
have
discovered
the
means
of
producing
upon
flat
canvas
the
relief
and
roundness
of
nature
i
realised
my
error
this
morning
by
daylight
ah
to
attain
that
glorious
result
i
have
thoroughly
studied
the
great
masters
of
colouring
i
have
analysed
and
raised
layer
by
layer
the
pictures
of
titian
that
king
of
light
like
that
sovereign
painter
i
have
sketched
my
figure
in
a
light
shade
with
soft
thick
colour
for
shading
is
simply
an
accident
remember
that
my
boy
then
i
returned
to
my
work
and
by
means
of
and
of
varnish
the
transparency
of
which
i
lessened
more
and
more
i
made
the
shadows
more
and
more
pronounced
even
to
the
deepest
blacks
for
the
shadows
of
ordinary
painters
are
of
a
different
nature
from
their
light
tones
they
are
wood
brass
whatever
you
choose
except
flesh
in
shadow
one
feels
that
if
a
figure
should
change
its
posture
the
shaded
places
would
not
brighten
and
would
never
become
light
i
have
avoided
that
fault
into
which
many
of
the
most
illustrious
artists
have
fallen
and
in
my
work
the
whiteness
of
the
flesh
stands
out
under
the
darkness
of
the
deepest
shadow
i
have
not
like
a
multitude
of
ignorant
fools
who
fancy
that
they
draw
correctly
because
they
make
a
carefully
shaded
stroke
marked
distinctly
the
outer
lines
of
my
figure
and
given
prominence
to
the
most
trivial
anatomical
details
for
the
human
body
does
not
end
in
lines
in
that
regard
sculptors
can
approach
the
truth
more
nearly
than
we
can
nature
demands
a
succession
of
rounded
outlines
which
shade
into
one
another
strictly
speaking
drawing
does
not
exist
do
not
laugh
young
man
however
strange
that
remark
may
seem
to
you
you
will
understand
its
meaning
some
the
line
is
the
means
by
which
man
interprets
the
effect
of
light
upon
objects
but
there
are
no
lines
in
nature
where
everything
is
full
it
is
in
modelling
that
one
draws
that
is
to
say
that
one
removes
things
from
the
surroundings
in
which
they
are
the
distribution
of
light
alone
gives
reality
to
the
body
so
that
i
have
not
sharply
outlined
the
features
i
have
spread
over
the
outlines
a
cloud
of
light
warm
the
result
being
that
one
can
not
place
one
finger
upon
the
exact
spot
where
the
outline
ends
and
the
background
begins
seen
at
close
quarters
the
work
seems
cottony
and
to
lack
precision
but
two
yards
away
everything
becomes
distinct
and
stands
out
the
body
moves
the
forms
become
prominent
and
one
can
feel
the
air
circulating
all
about
however
i
am
not
satisfied
yet
i
still
have
doubts
perhaps
i
should
not
have
drawn
a
single
line
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
attack
a
figure
in
the
middle
devoting
one
self
first
to
the
prominences
which
are
most
in
the
light
and
passing
then
to
the
darker
portions
is
not
that
the
way
in
which
the
sun
that
divine
painter
of
the
universe
proceeds
o
nature
nature
who
has
ever
surprised
thee
in
thy
flights
i
tell
you
that
too
much
knowledge
like
ignorance
ends
in
a
negation
i
doubt
my
work
the
old
man
paused
then
continued
for
ten
years
young
man
i
have
been
working
but
what
are
ten
short
years
when
it
is
a
question
of
contending
with
nature
we
have
no
idea
how
long
a
time
pygmalion
employed
in
making
the
only
statue
that
ever
walked
the
old
man
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
and
sat
with
staring
eyes
mechanically
toying
with
his
knife
he
is
conversing
with
his
now
said
porbus
in
an
undertone
at
that
word
nicolas
poussin
became
conscious
of
the
presence
of
an
indefinable
artistic
curiosity
that
old
man
with
the
white
eyes
staring
and
torpid
became
in
his
eyes
more
than
a
man
he
assumed
the
aspect
of
an
unreal
genius
living
in
an
unknown
sphere
he
stirred
a
thousand
confused
ideas
in
his
mind
the
mental
phenomenon
of
that
species
of
fascination
can
no
more
be
defined
than
one
can
define
the
emotion
aroused
by
a
ballad
which
recalls
the
fatherland
to
the
heart
the
contempt
which
that
old
man
affected
to
express
for
the
most
beautiful
works
of
art
his
wealth
his
manners
the
deference
with
which
porbus
treated
him
that
work
kept
secret
so
long
a
work
of
patience
and
of
genius
doubtless
judging
by
the
head
of
a
which
young
poussin
had
so
enthusiastically
admired
and
which
still
beautiful
even
beside
mabuse
bore
witness
to
the
imperial
workmanship
of
one
of
the
princes
of
art
everything
in
short
about
the
old
man
went
beyond
the
bounds
of
human
nature
the
one
point
which
was
perfectly
clear
and
manifest
to
nicolas
poussin
fertile
imagination
was
a
complete
image
of
the
artistic
nature
of
that
irresponsible
nature
to
which
so
many
powers
are
entrusted
and
which
too
often
misuses
them
leading
cold
reason
the
honest
bourgeois
and
even
some
experts
through
innumerable
paths
where
there
is
nothing
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
whereas
that
damsel
unreasoning
in
her
fancies
discovers
these
epic
poems
châteaux
and
works
of
art
a
sardonic
but
kindly
nature
fertile
but
sterile
thus
to
the
enthusiastic
poussin
that
old
man
had
become
by
an
abrupt
transfiguration
art
itself
art
with
its
secrets
its
unruly
impulses
and
its
reveries
yes
my
dear
porbus
frenhofer
resumed
i
have
failed
thus
far
to
meet
an
absolutely
flawless
woman
a
body
the
outlines
of
which
are
perfectly
beautiful
and
whose
colouring
but
where
is
she
to
be
found
in
real
life
he
asked
interrupting
himself
that
undiscoverable
venus
of
the
ancients
so
often
sought
of
whom
we
find
only
a
few
scattered
charms
oh
to
see
for
an
instant
but
a
single
time
that
divine
complete
in
a
word
ideal
nature
i
would
give
my
whole
fortune
aye
i
would
seek
thee
in
the
abode
of
the
dead
o
divine
beauty
like
orpheus
i
would
go
down
into
the
hell
of
art
to
bring
life
back
thence
we
may
go
away
said
porbus
to
poussin
he
neither
hears
nor
sees
us
now
let
us
go
to
his
studio
suggested
the
youth
oh
the
old
fellow
knows
how
to
keep
people
out
his
treasures
are
too
well
guarded
for
us
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
them
i
have
not
awaited
your
suggestion
and
your
longing
before
attacking
the
mystery
so
there
is
a
mystery
yes
porbus
replied
old
frenhofer
is
the
only
pupil
whom
mabuse
would
ever
consent
to
take
having
become
his
friend
his
saviour
his
father
frenhofer
sacrificed
the
greater
part
of
his
property
to
humour
mabuse
passions
in
exchange
mabuse
bequeathed
to
him
the
secret
of
the
power
of
imparting
to
figures
that
extraordinary
appearance
of
life
that
touch
of
nature
which
is
our
despair
but
of
which
he
was
such
a
thorough
master
that
one
day
having
sold
and
drunk
the
flowered
damask
which
he
was
to
wear
on
the
occasion
of
charles
entry
into
paris
he
attended
his
master
in
a
garment
of
paper
painted
to
represent
damask
the
peculiar
brilliancy
of
the
fabric
worn
by
mabuse
surprised
the
emperor
who
when
he
attempted
to
compliment
the
old
drunkard
patron
discovered
the
fraud
frenhofer
is
passionately
devoted
to
our
art
and
he
looks
higher
and
farther
ahead
than
other
painters
he
has
given
much
profound
thought
to
the
subject
of
colouring
and
to
the
absolute
accuracy
of
lines
but
he
has
studied
so
much
that
he
has
reached
the
point
where
he
is
uncertain
of
the
very
object
of
his
studies
in
his
moments
of
despair
he
declares
that
drawing
does
not
exist
and
that
only
geometrical
figures
can
be
made
with
lines
which
is
going
beyond
the
truth
for
with
lines
and
with
black
which
is
not
a
colour
a
human
figure
maybe
drawn
which
proves
that
our
art
like
nature
is
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
elements
drawing
furnishes
a
skeleton
colour
gives
life
but
life
without
the
skeleton
is
much
less
complete
than
the
skeleton
without
life
in
short
there
is
one
thing
which
is
more
true
than
any
of
these
and
that
is
that
practice
and
observation
are
everything
with
a
painter
and
that
if
reason
and
poetic
sense
quarrel
with
the
brush
we
arrive
at
doubt
like
our
excellent
friend
here
who
is
as
much
madman
as
painter
a
sublime
artist
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
born
rich
which
permitted
him
to
go
astray
do
not
imitate
him
work
painters
ought
not
to
meditate
except
with
brush
in
hand
we
will
find
our
way
there
cried
poussin
no
longer
listening
to
porbus
and
undeterred
by
doubts
porbus
smiled
at
the
young
stranger
enthusiasm
and
when
they
parted
invited
him
to
come
to
see
him
nicolas
poussin
walked
slowly
back
to
rue
de
la
harpe
and
passed
unperceiving
the
modest
house
in
which
he
lodged
ascending
his
wretched
staircase
with
anxious
haste
he
reached
a
room
high
up
beneath
a
roof
supported
by
pillars
a
simple
and
airy
style
of
architecture
found
in
the
houses
of
old
paris
beside
the
single
dark
window
of
that
room
sat
a
girl
who
when
she
heard
the
door
sprang
at
once
to
her
feet
with
a
loving
impulse
she
recognised
the
painter
by
the
way
he
raised
the
latch
what
the
matter
she
asked
the
matter
the
matter
he
cried
choking
with
joy
the
matter
is
that
i
have
come
to
feel
that
i
am
a
painter
i
have
always
doubted
myself
before
but
this
morning
i
believe
in
myself
i
tell
you
gillette
we
shall
be
rich
happy
there
is
gold
in
these
brushes
but
suddenly
he
ceased
to
speak
his
strong
and
serious
face
lost
its
joyous
expression
when
he
compared
the
vastness
of
his
hopes
with
the
paucity
of
his
resources
the
walls
were
covered
with
pieces
of
common
paper
on
which
were
sketches
in
pencil
he
owned
no
clean
canvases
paints
commanded
a
high
price
in
those
days
and
the
poor
young
palette
was
almost
bare
in
the
depths
of
his
poverty
he
possessed
and
was
conscious
of
an
incredible
store
of
courage
and
a
superabundance
of
genius
brought
to
paris
by
a
gentleman
who
was
a
friend
of
his
or
perhaps
by
his
own
talent
he
had
almost
immediately
fallen
in
with
a
mistress
one
of
those
noble
and
devoted
souls
who
suffer
beside
a
great
man
espouse
his
troubles
and
try
to
understand
his
caprices
strong
in
poverty
and
love
as
other
women
are
fearless
in
bearing
the
burden
of
luxury
and
in
parading
their
lack
of
feeling
the
smile
that
played
about
gillette
lips
diffused
a
golden
light
through
that
garret
and
overspread
the
sky
with
brightness
the
sun
did
not
always
shine
whereas
she
was
always
there
sedate
in
her
passion
clinging
to
her
happiness
and
her
suffering
encouraging
the
genius
which
overflowed
in
love
before
seizing
upon
art
listen
gillette
come
here
the
obedient
girl
jumped
upon
the
painter
knees
she
was
all
grace
all
beauty
lovely
as
a
spring
day
adorned
by
all
womanly
charms
and
illumining
them
with
the
glow
of
a
lovely
soul
o
god
he
cried
i
shall
never
dare
to
tell
her
a
secret
said
she
i
insist
upon
knowing
it
poussin
seemed
lost
in
thought
speak
i
say
gillette
poor
beloved
darling
ah
you
want
something
of
me
do
you
yes
if
you
want
me
to
pose
for
you
as
i
did
the
other
day
she
said
with
a
little
pout
i
shall
never
consent
for
at
those
times
your
eyes
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
to
me
you
forget
all
about
me
and
yet
you
look
at
me
would
you
prefer
to
see
me
painting
another
woman
perhaps
so
she
said
if
she
was
very
ugly
well
rejoined
poussin
in
a
serious
tone
suppose
that
for
any
future
glory
to
make
me
a
great
painter
it
were
necessary
for
you
to
pose
for
another
artist
you
can
test
me
all
you
choose
she
replied
you
know
that
i
would
not
go
poussin
let
his
head
fall
on
his
breast
like
one
who
surrenders
to
a
joy
or
a
sorrow
that
is
too
great
for
his
heart
listen
said
she
plucking
at
the
sleeve
of
poussin
threadbare
doublet
i
have
told
you
nick
that
i
would
give
my
life
for
you
but
i
never
promised
to
give
up
my
love
while
i
am
alive
give
it
up
cried
the
young
artist
if
i
should
show
myself
like
that
to
another
man
you
would
cease
to
love
me
and
i
should
deem
myself
unworthy
of
you
is
it
not
a
most
simple
and
natural
thing
to
obey
your
whims
in
spite
of
myself
i
am
happy
aye
proud
to
do
your
dear
will
but
for
another
man
ah
no
forgive
me
my
gillette
cried
the
painter
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
i
prefer
to
be
beloved
rather
than
famous
in
my
eyes
you
are
fairer
than
wealth
and
honours
go
throw
away
my
brushes
burn
these
sketches
i
have
made
a
mistake
my
vocation
is
to
love
you
i
am
no
painter
i
am
a
lover
away
with
art
and
all
its
secrets
she
gazed
admiringly
at
him
happy
overjoyed
she
was
queen
she
felt
instinctively
that
art
was
forgotten
for
her
and
cast
at
her
feet
like
a
grain
of
incense
and
yet
it
is
only
an
old
man
continued
poussin
he
could
see
only
the
woman
in
you
you
are
so
perfect
one
must
needs
love
she
cried
ready
to
sacrifice
the
scruples
of
her
love
to
repay
her
lover
for
all
the
sacrifices
that
he
made
for
her
but
she
added
it
would
be
my
ruin
ah
ruin
for
you
yes
that
would
be
very
lovely
but
you
will
forget
me
oh
what
a
wicked
idea
this
is
of
yours
i
conceived
the
idea
and
i
love
you
he
said
with
a
sort
of
contrition
but
am
i
for
that
reason
a
villain
let
us
consult
father
hardouin
she
said
oh
no
let
it
be
a
secret
between
us
very
good
i
will
go
but
do
not
be
there
she
cried
stay
at
the
door
with
your
dagger
drawn
if
i
cry
out
come
in
and
kill
the
painter
with
no
eyes
for
aught
but
his
art
poussin
threw
his
arms
about
gillette
he
no
longer
loves
me
thought
gillette
when
she
was
alone
already
she
repented
her
decision
but
she
was
soon
seized
by
a
terror
more
painful
than
her
regret
she
strove
to
drive
away
a
shocking
thought
that
stole
into
her
mind
she
fancied
that
she
already
loved
the
painter
less
because
she
suspected
that
he
was
less
estimable
than
she
had
hitherto
believed
ii
catherine
lescault
three
months
after
the
meeting
of
poussin
and
porbus
the
latter
went
to
see
master
frenhofer
the
old
man
was
then
in
the
depths
of
one
of
those
periods
of
profound
and
sudden
discouragement
the
cause
of
which
if
we
are
to
believe
the
mathematicians
of
medicine
consists
in
bad
digestion
the
wind
the
heat
or
some
disturbance
in
the
hypochondriac
region
and
according
to
the
spiritualists
in
the
imperfection
of
our
moral
nature
the
good
man
had
simply
tired
himself
out
in
finishing
his
mysterious
picture
he
was
languidly
reclining
in
an
enormous
chair
of
carved
oak
upholstered
in
black
leather
and
without
changing
his
depressed
attitude
he
darted
at
porbus
the
glance
of
a
man
who
had
determined
to
make
the
best
of
his
ennui
well
master
said
porbus
was
the
ultramarine
that
you
went
to
bruges
for
very
bad
have
you
been
able
to
grind
our
new
white
is
your
oil
poor
or
are
your
brushes
unmanageable
alas
cried
the
old
man
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
my
work
was
finished
but
i
certainly
have
gone
astray
in
some
details
and
my
mind
will
not
be
at
rest
until
i
have
solved
my
doubts
i
have
almost
decided
to
travel
to
go
to
turkey
to
greece
and
to
asia
in
search
of
a
model
and
to
compare
my
picture
with
nature
in
different
climes
it
may
be
that
i
have
he
continued
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
nature
herself
sometimes
i
am
almost
afraid
that
a
breath
will
awaken
that
woman
and
that
she
will
disappear
then
he
rose
abruptly
as
if
to
go
ah
replied
porbus
i
have
come
just
in
time
to
save
you
the
expense
and
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
how
so
asked
frenhofer
in
amazement
young
poussin
is
loved
by
a
woman
whose
incomparable
beauty
is
absolutely
without
a
flaw
but
my
dear
master
if
he
consents
to
lend
her
to
you
you
must
at
least
let
us
see
your
picture
the
old
man
stood
perfectly
motionless
in
a
state
of
utter
stupefaction
what
he
cried
at
last
in
a
heartrending
voice
show
my
creation
my
spouse
tear
away
the
veil
with
which
i
have
modestly
covered
my
happiness
why
that
would
be
the
most
shocking
prostitution
for
ten
years
i
have
lived
with
that
woman
she
is
mine
mine
alone
she
loves
me
does
she
not
smile
at
every
stroke
of
the
brush
which
i
give
her
she
has
a
soul
the
soul
with
which
i
have
endowed
her
she
would
blush
if
other
eyes
than
mine
should
rest
upon
her
show
her
where
is
the
husband
the
lover
base
enough
to
lend
his
wife
to
dishonour
when
you
paint
a
picture
for
the
court
you
do
not
put
your
whole
soul
into
it
you
sell
to
the
courtiers
nothing
more
than
coloured
mannikins
my
painting
is
not
a
painting
it
is
a
sentiment
a
passion
born
in
my
studio
it
must
remain
there
unsullied
and
can
not
come
forth
until
it
is
clothed
poesy
and
women
never
abandon
themselves
naked
to
any
but
their
lovers
do
we
possess
raphael
model
ariosto
angelica
or
dante
beatrice
no
we
see
only
their
shapes
very
well
the
work
which
i
have
under
lock
and
key
is
an
exception
in
our
art
it
is
not
a
canvas
it
is
a
woman
a
woman
with
whom
i
weep
and
laugh
and
talk
and
think
do
you
expect
me
suddenly
to
lay
aside
a
joy
that
has
lasted
ten
years
as
one
lays
aside
a
cloak
do
you
expect
me
suddenly
to
cease
to
be
father
lover
and
god
that
woman
is
not
a
creature
she
is
a
creation
let
your
young
man
come
i
will
give
him
my
wealth
i
will
give
him
pictures
by
correggio
michelangelo
or
titian
i
will
kiss
his
footprints
in
the
dust
but
make
him
my
rival
shame
ah
i
am
even
more
lover
than
painter
yes
i
shall
have
the
strength
to
burn
my
when
i
breathe
my
last
but
to
force
her
to
endure
the
glance
of
a
man
of
a
young
man
of
a
painter
no
no
i
would
kill
the
man
who
should
sully
her
with
a
look
i
would
kill
you
on
the
instant
my
friend
if
you
did
not
salute
her
on
your
knees
do
you
expect
me
now
to
subject
my
idol
to
the
insensible
glances
and
absurd
criticisms
of
fools
ah
love
is
a
mystery
it
lives
only
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
heart
and
all
is
lost
when
a
man
says
even
to
his
friend
is
she
whom
i
love
the
old
man
seemed
to
have
become
young
again
his
eyes
gleamed
with
life
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
a
bright
red
and
his
hands
shook
porbus
surprised
by
the
passionate
force
with
which
the
words
were
spoken
did
not
know
what
reply
to
make
to
an
emotion
no
less
novel
than
profound
was
frenhofer
sane
or
mad
was
he
under
the
spell
of
an
artistic
caprice
or
did
the
ideas
which
he
had
expressed
proceed
from
that
strange
fanaticism
produced
in
us
by
the
long
gestation
of
a
great
work
could
one
hope
ever
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
that
extraordinary
passion
engrossed
by
all
these
thoughts
porbus
said
to
the
old
man
but
is
it
not
woman
for
woman
will
not
poussin
abandon
his
mistress
to
your
eyes
what
mistress
rejoined
frenhofer
she
will
betray
him
sooner
or
later
mine
will
always
be
faithful
to
me
very
well
said
porbus
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
but
perhaps
before
you
find
even
in
asia
a
woman
so
lovely
so
perfect
as
is
she
of
whom
i
speak
you
will
die
without
finishing
your
picture
ah
it
is
finished
said
frenhofer
whoever
should
see
it
would
think
that
he
was
looking
at
a
woman
lying
upon
a
velvet
couch
behind
a
curtain
beside
her
is
a
golden
tripod
containing
perfumes
you
would
be
tempted
to
seize
the
tassel
of
the
cords
which
hold
the
curtain
and
you
would
fancy
that
you
saw
the
bosom
of
catherine
lescault
a
beautiful
courtesan
called
belle
rise
and
fall
with
the
movement
of
her
breath
however
i
should
like
to
be
certain
oh
go
to
asia
porbus
replied
as
he
detected
a
sort
of
hesitation
in
frenhofer
expression
and
porbus
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
room
at
that
moment
gillette
and
nicolas
poussin
arrived
at
house
when
the
girl
was
about
to
enter
she
stepped
back
as
if
she
were
oppressed
by
some
sudden
presentiment
why
have
i
come
here
pray
she
asked
her
lover
in
a
deep
voice
gazing
at
him
steadfastly
gillette
i
left
you
entirely
at
liberty
and
i
mean
to
obey
you
in
everything
you
are
my
conscience
and
my
renown
go
back
to
the
house
i
shall
be
happier
perhaps
than
if
you
do
i
belong
to
myself
when
you
speak
to
me
thus
oh
no
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
child
come
she
added
apparently
making
a
mighty
effort
if
our
love
dies
and
if
i
plant
in
my
heart
a
regret
will
not
your
fame
be
the
reward
of
my
compliance
with
your
wishes
let
us
go
in
it
will
be
like
living
again
to
be
always
present
as
a
memory
on
your
palette
as
they
opened
the
door
of
the
house
the
two
lovers
met
porbus
who
startled
by
the
beauty
of
gillette
whose
eyes
were
then
filled
with
tears
seized
her
trembling
from
head
to
foot
as
she
was
and
said
leading
her
into
the
old
man
presence
look
is
she
not
above
all
the
masterpieces
on
earth
frenhofer
started
gillette
stood
there
in
the
ingenuous
and
unaffected
attitude
of
a
young
georgian
girl
innocent
and
timid
abducted
by
brigands
and
offered
for
sale
to
a
a
modest
flush
tinged
her
cheeks
she
lowered
her
eyes
her
hands
were
hanging
at
her
side
her
strength
seemed
to
abandon
her
and
tears
protested
against
the
violence
done
to
her
modesty
at
that
moment
poussin
distressed
beyond
words
because
he
had
taken
that
lovely
pearl
from
his
garret
cursed
himself
he
became
more
lover
than
artist
and
innumerable
scruples
tortured
his
heart
when
he
saw
the
old
man
kindling
eye
as
in
accordance
with
the
habit
of
painters
he
mentally
disrobed
the
girl
so
to
speak
divining
her
most
secret
forms
thereupon
the
young
man
reverted
to
the
savage
jealousy
of
true
love
let
us
go
gillette
he
cried
at
that
tone
at
that
outcry
his
mistress
looked
up
at
him
in
rapture
saw
his
face
and
ran
into
his
arms
ah
you
do
love
me
then
she
replied
melting
into
tears
although
she
had
mustered
energy
to
impose
silence
upon
her
suffering
she
lacked
strength
to
conceal
her
joy
oh
leave
her
with
me
for
a
moment
said
the
old
painter
and
you
may
compare
her
to
my
yes
i
consent
there
was
love
in
frenhofer
cry
too
he
seemed
to
be
acting
the
part
of
a
coquette
for
his
counterfeit
woman
and
to
enjoy
in
advance
the
triumph
which
the
beauty
of
his
creation
would
certainly
win
over
that
of
a
girl
of
flesh
and
blood
do
not
let
him
retract
cried
porbus
bringing
his
hand
down
on
poussin
shoulder
the
fruits
of
love
soon
pass
away
those
of
art
are
immortal
in
his
eyes
retorted
gillette
looking
earnestly
at
poussin
and
porbus
in
his
eyes
am
i
nothing
more
than
a
woman
she
tossed
her
head
proudly
but
when
after
a
flashing
glance
at
frenhofer
she
saw
her
lover
gazing
at
the
portrait
which
he
had
formerly
mistaken
for
a
giorgione
she
said
ah
let
us
go
up
he
never
looked
at
me
like
that
old
man
said
poussin
roused
from
his
meditation
by
voice
look
at
this
sword
i
will
bury
it
in
your
heart
at
the
first
word
of
complaint
that
this
girl
utters
i
will
set
fire
to
your
house
and
no
one
shall
leave
it
do
you
understand
nicolas
poussin
face
was
dark
and
his
voice
was
terrible
the
young
painter
attitude
and
above
all
his
gesture
comforted
gillette
who
almost
forgave
him
for
sacrificing
her
to
painting
and
to
his
glorious
future
porbus
and
poussin
remained
at
the
door
of
the
studio
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
although
at
first
the
painter
of
the
indulged
in
an
exclamation
or
two
ah
she
is
undressing
he
is
telling
her
to
stand
in
the
light
now
he
is
comparing
her
with
the
other
he
soon
held
his
peace
at
the
aspect
of
poussin
whose
face
was
profoundly
wretched
and
although
the
old
painters
had
none
of
those
scruples
which
seem
so
trivial
in
the
presence
of
art
he
admired
them
they
were
so
attractive
and
so
innocent
the
young
man
had
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
and
his
ear
almost
glued
to
the
door
the
two
men
standing
thus
in
the
darkness
resembled
two
conspirators
awaiting
the
moment
to
strike
down
a
tyrant
come
in
come
in
cried
the
old
man
radiant
with
joy
my
work
is
perfect
and
now
i
can
show
it
with
pride
never
will
painter
brushes
colours
canvas
and
light
produce
a
rival
to
catherine
lescault
the
beautiful
courtesan
impelled
by
the
most
intense
curiosity
porbus
and
poussin
hurried
to
the
centre
of
an
enormous
studio
covered
with
dust
where
everything
was
in
disorder
and
where
they
saw
pictures
hanging
on
the
walls
here
and
there
they
paused
at
first
in
front
of
a
figure
of
a
woman
half
nude
which
aroused
their
admiration
oh
do
pay
any
attention
to
that
said
frenhofer
that
is
a
sketch
that
i
dashed
off
to
study
a
pose
it
is
worth
nothing
as
a
picture
there
are
some
of
my
mistakes
he
continued
pointing
to
a
number
of
fascinating
compositions
hanging
on
the
walls
about
them
at
those
words
porbus
and
poussin
thunderstruck
by
his
contempt
for
such
works
looked
about
for
the
famous
portrait
but
could
not
discover
it
well
there
it
is
said
the
old
man
whose
hair
was
dishevelled
whose
face
was
inflamed
by
superhuman
excitement
whose
eyes
sparkled
and
who
panted
like
a
young
man
drunk
with
love
aha
he
cried
you
did
not
expect
such
absolute
perfection
you
are
before
a
woman
and
you
are
looking
for
a
picture
there
is
so
much
depth
on
this
canvas
the
air
is
so
real
that
you
can
not
distinguish
it
from
the
air
that
surrounds
us
where
is
art
lost
vanished
behold
the
actual
form
of
a
young
girl
have
i
not
obtained
to
perfection
the
colour
the
sharpness
of
the
line
which
seems
to
bound
the
body
is
it
not
the
same
phenomenon
presented
by
objects
in
the
atmosphere
as
well
as
by
fishes
in
the
water
observe
how
the
outlines
stand
out
from
the
background
does
it
not
seem
to
you
that
you
could
pass
your
hand
over
that
back
why
for
seven
years
i
studied
the
effects
of
the
conjunction
of
light
and
of
objects
and
that
hair
does
not
the
light
fairly
inundate
it
why
she
actually
breathed
i
believe
look
at
that
bosom
ah
who
would
not
adore
her
on
his
knees
the
flesh
quivers
she
is
going
to
rise
wait
can
you
see
anything
poussin
asked
porbus
no
and
you
nothing
the
two
painters
left
the
old
man
to
his
dreams
and
looked
to
see
whether
the
light
falling
straight
upon
the
canvas
to
which
he
was
pointing
did
not
efface
all
the
lines
they
examined
the
picture
from
the
right
from
the
left
and
in
front
alternately
stooping
and
rising
yes
yes
it
really
canvas
said
frenhofer
mistaking
the
purpose
of
that
careful
scrutiny
see
here
is
the
frame
and
the
easel
and
here
are
my
colours
and
my
brushes
and
he
seized
a
brush
and
handed
it
to
them
with
an
artless
gesture
the
old
villain
is
making
sport
of
us
said
poussin
returning
to
his
position
in
front
of
the
alleged
picture
i
can
see
nothing
but
a
confused
mass
of
colours
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
curious
lines
which
form
a
wall
of
painting
we
were
mistaken
look
replied
porbus
on
going
nearer
they
saw
in
the
corner
of
the
canvas
the
end
of
a
bare
foot
emerging
from
that
chaos
of
vague
colours
and
shades
that
sort
of
shapeless
mist
but
a
most
lovely
a
living
foot
they
stood
speechless
with
admiration
before
that
fragment
which
had
escaped
a
slow
relentless
incomprehensible
destruction
that
foot
was
like
a
bust
of
venus
in
parian
marble
rising
amid
the
ruins
of
a
burned
city
there
is
a
woman
underneath
cried
porbus
calling
attention
to
the
coats
of
paint
which
the
old
painter
had
laid
on
one
after
another
thinking
that
he
was
perfecting
his
work
the
two
artists
turned
impulsively
towards
frenhofer
beginning
to
understand
although
but
vaguely
the
state
of
ecstasy
in
which
he
lived
he
acts
in
perfect
good
faith
said
porbus
yes
my
friend
said
the
old
man
rousing
himself
one
must
have
faith
faith
in
art
and
must
live
a
long
while
with
his
work
to
produce
such
a
creation
some
of
those
shadows
have
cost
me
many
hours
of
toil
see
on
the
cheek
just
below
the
eye
there
is
a
faint
penumbra
which
if
you
notice
it
in
nature
will
seem
to
you
almost
beyond
reproduction
well
do
you
think
that
that
effect
did
not
cost
me
trouble
but
look
closely
at
my
work
my
dear
porbus
and
you
will
understand
better
what
i
said
to
you
as
to
the
method
of
treating
modelling
and
outlines
look
at
the
light
on
the
breast
and
see
how
by
a
succession
of
strongly
emphasised
touches
and
retouches
i
have
succeeded
in
reproducing
the
real
light
and
in
combining
it
with
the
polished
whiteness
of
the
light
tones
and
how
by
the
opposite
means
by
effacing
the
lumps
and
the
roughness
of
the
colours
i
have
been
able
by
softly
retouching
the
outline
of
my
figure
drowned
in
the
to
take
away
even
a
suggestion
of
drawing
and
of
artificial
means
and
to
give
it
the
aspect
and
the
roundness
of
nature
itself
go
nearer
and
you
will
see
the
work
better
at
a
distance
it
is
imperceptible
look
just
here
it
is
very
remarkable
i
think
and
with
the
end
of
his
brush
he
pointed
out
to
the
two
painters
a
layer
of
light
paint
porbus
laid
his
hand
on
the
old
man
shoulder
and
said
turning
to
poussin
do
you
know
that
we
have
before
us
a
very
great
painter
he
is
even
more
poet
than
painter
replied
poussin
gravely
here
rejoined
porbus
pointing
to
the
canvas
here
ends
our
art
on
earth
and
from
here
it
soars
upwards
and
disappears
in
the
skies
said
poussin
how
much
pleasure
is
concentrated
on
this
piece
of
canvas
cried
porbus
the
old
man
completely
distraught
did
not
listen
to
them
he
was
smiling
at
that
ideal
woman
but
sooner
or
later
he
will
discover
that
there
is
nothing
on
his
canvas
exclaimed
poussin
nothing
on
my
canvas
cried
frenhofer
gazing
at
the
two
painters
and
at
his
alleged
picture
in
turn
what
have
you
done
whispered
porbus
to
poussin
the
old
man
grasped
the
young
man
arm
violently
and
said
to
him
you
see
nothing
you
clown
you
boor
you
idiot
you
villain
then
why
did
you
come
up
here
my
dear
porbus
he
continued
turning
towards
the
painter
is
it
possible
that
you
too
would
mock
at
me
i
am
your
friend
tell
me
have
i
spoiled
my
picture
porbus
hesitated
not
daring
to
say
anything
but
the
anxiety
depicted
on
the
old
man
pale
face
was
so
heartrending
that
he
pointed
to
the
canvas
saying
look
frenhofer
gazed
at
his
picture
for
a
moment
and
staggered
nothing
nothing
and
after
working
ten
years
he
sat
down
and
wept
so
i
am
an
idiot
a
madman
i
have
neither
talent
nor
capacity
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
rich
man
who
when
i
walk
do
nothing
but
walk
so
i
have
produced
nothing
he
gazed
at
his
canvas
through
his
tears
suddenly
he
rose
with
a
gesture
of
pride
and
cast
a
flashing
glance
at
the
two
painters
by
the
blood
by
the
body
by
the
head
of
the
christ
you
are
jealous
hounds
who
wish
to
make
me
believe
that
it
is
spoiled
in
order
to
steal
it
from
me
but
i
can
see
her
he
cried
and
she
is
wonderfully
lovely
at
that
moment
poussin
heard
gillette
crying
in
a
corner
where
she
was
cowering
entirely
forgotten
what
is
the
matter
my
angel
asked
the
painter
suddenly
become
the
lover
once
more
kill
me
she
said
i
should
be
a
shameless
creature
to
love
you
still
for
i
despise
you
i
admire
you
and
i
have
a
horror
of
you
i
love
you
and
i
believe
that
i
hate
you
already
while
poussin
listened
to
gillette
frenhofer
covered
his
with
a
green
curtain
with
the
calm
gravity
of
a
jeweller
closing
his
drawers
when
he
thinks
that
he
is
in
the
company
of
clever
thieves
he
bestowed
upon
the
two
painters
a
profoundly
cunning
glance
full
of
contempt
and
suspicion
and
silently
ushered
them
out
of
his
studio
with
convulsive
haste
then
standing
in
his
doorway
he
said
to
them
adieu
my
little
friends
that
adieu
horrified
the
two
painters
the
next
day
porbus
in
his
anxiety
went
again
to
see
frenhofer
and
learned
that
he
had
died
in
the
night
after
burning
all
his
pictures
a
seashore
drama
to
madame
la
princesse
caroline
galitzin
de
genthod
née
comtesse
walewska
author
homage
and
young
men
almost
always
have
a
pair
of
compasses
with
which
they
delight
to
measure
the
future
when
their
will
is
in
accord
with
the
size
of
the
angle
which
they
make
the
world
is
theirs
but
this
phenomenon
of
moral
life
takes
place
only
at
a
certain
age
that
age
which
in
the
case
of
all
men
comes
between
the
years
of
and
is
the
age
of
noble
thoughts
the
age
of
first
conceptions
because
it
is
the
age
of
unbounded
desires
the
age
at
which
one
doubts
nothing
he
who
talks
of
doubt
speaks
of
impotence
after
that
age
which
passes
as
quickly
as
the
season
for
sowing
comes
the
age
of
execution
there
are
in
a
certain
sense
two
youths
one
during
which
one
thinks
the
other
during
which
one
acts
often
they
are
blended
in
men
whom
nature
has
favoured
and
who
like
caesar
newton
and
bonaparte
are
the
greatest
among
great
men
i
was
reckoning
how
much
time
a
thought
needs
to
develop
itself
and
compasses
in
hand
standing
on
a
cliff
a
hundred
fathoms
above
the
ocean
whose
waves
played
among
the
reefs
i
laid
out
my
future
furnishing
it
with
works
as
an
engineer
draws
fortresses
and
palaces
upon
vacant
land
the
sea
was
lovely
i
had
just
dressed
after
bathing
i
was
waiting
for
pauline
my
guardian
angel
who
was
bathing
in
a
granite
bowl
full
of
white
sand
the
daintiest
that
nature
ever
designed
for
any
of
her
we
were
at
the
extreme
point
of
le
croisic
a
tiny
peninsula
of
brittany
we
were
far
from
the
harbour
in
a
spot
which
the
authorities
considered
so
inaccessible
that
the
almost
never
visited
it
to
swim
in
the
air
after
swimming
in
the
sea
ah
who
would
not
have
swum
into
the
future
why
did
i
think
why
does
evil
happen
who
knows
ideas
come
to
your
heart
or
your
brain
without
consulting
you
no
courtesan
was
ever
more
whimsical
or
more
imperious
than
is
conception
in
an
artist
it
must
be
caught
like
fortune
by
the
hair
when
it
comes
clinging
to
my
thought
as
astolphe
clung
to
his
hippogriff
i
galloped
through
the
world
arranging
everything
therein
to
suit
my
pleasure
when
i
looked
about
me
in
search
of
some
omen
favourable
to
the
audacious
schemes
which
my
wild
imagination
advised
me
to
undertake
a
sweet
cry
the
cry
of
a
woman
calling
in
the
silence
of
the
desert
the
cry
of
a
woman
coming
from
the
bath
refreshed
and
joyous
drowned
the
murmur
of
the
fringe
of
foam
tossed
constantly
back
and
forth
by
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
waves
in
the
indentations
of
the
shore
when
i
heard
that
note
uttered
by
the
soul
i
fancied
that
i
had
seen
on
the
cliff
the
foot
of
an
angel
who
as
she
unfolded
her
wings
had
called
to
me
thou
shalt
have
success
i
descended
radiant
with
joy
and
light
as
air
i
went
bounding
down
like
a
stone
down
a
steep
slope
when
she
saw
me
she
said
to
me
what
is
the
matter
i
did
not
answer
but
my
eyes
became
moist
the
day
before
pauline
had
understood
my
pain
as
she
understood
at
that
moment
my
joy
with
the
magical
sensitiveness
of
a
harp
which
follows
the
variations
of
the
atmosphere
the
life
of
man
has
some
glorious
moments
we
walked
silently
along
the
shore
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
sea
without
a
ripple
others
would
have
seen
only
two
blue
plains
one
above
the
other
but
we
who
understood
each
other
without
need
of
speech
we
who
could
discover
between
those
two
of
infinity
the
illusions
with
which
youth
is
nourished
we
pressed
each
other
hand
at
the
slightest
change
which
took
place
either
in
the
sheet
of
water
or
in
the
expanse
of
air
for
we
took
those
trivial
phenomena
for
material
interpretations
of
our
twofold
thought
who
has
not
enjoyed
that
unbounded
bliss
in
pleasure
when
the
soul
seems
to
be
released
from
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
and
to
be
restored
as
it
were
to
the
world
whence
it
came
pleasure
is
not
our
only
guide
in
those
regions
are
there
not
times
when
the
sentiments
embrace
each
other
as
of
their
own
motion
and
fly
thither
like
two
children
who
take
each
other
hands
and
begin
to
run
without
knowing
why
or
whither
we
walked
along
thus
at
the
moment
that
the
roofs
of
the
town
appeared
on
the
horizon
forming
a
grayish
line
we
met
a
poor
fisherman
who
was
returning
to
le
croisic
his
feet
were
bare
his
canvas
trousers
were
ragged
on
the
edges
with
many
holes
imperfectly
mended
he
wore
a
shirt
of
wretched
list
suspenders
and
his
jacket
was
a
mere
rag
the
sight
of
that
misery
distressed
us
a
discord
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
our
harmony
we
looked
at
each
other
to
lament
that
we
had
not
at
that
moment
the
power
to
draw
upon
the
treasury
of
we
saw
a
magnificent
lobster
and
a
crab
hanging
by
a
cord
which
the
fisherman
carried
in
his
right
hand
while
in
the
other
he
had
his
nets
and
his
fishing
apparatus
we
accosted
him
with
the
purpose
of
buying
his
fish
an
idea
which
occurred
to
both
of
us
and
which
expressed
itself
in
a
smile
to
which
i
replied
by
slightly
pressing
the
arm
which
i
held
and
drawing
it
closer
to
my
heart
it
was
one
of
those
nothings
which
the
memory
afterward
transforms
into
a
poem
when
sitting
by
the
fire
we
recall
the
time
when
that
nothing
moved
us
the
place
where
it
happened
and
that
mirage
the
effects
of
which
have
never
been
defined
but
which
often
exerts
an
influence
upon
the
objects
which
surround
us
when
life
is
pleasant
and
our
hearts
are
full
the
loveliest
places
are
simply
what
we
make
them
who
is
the
man
however
little
of
a
poet
he
may
be
who
has
not
in
his
memory
a
bowlder
that
occupies
more
space
than
the
most
famous
landscape
visited
at
great
expense
beside
that
bowlder
what
tempestuous
thoughts
there
a
whole
life
mapped
out
here
fears
banished
there
rays
of
hope
entered
the
heart
at
that
moment
the
sun
sympathising
with
these
thoughts
of
love
and
of
the
future
cast
upon
the
yellowish
sides
of
that
cliff
an
ardent
beam
some
mountain
attracted
the
attention
the
tranquillity
and
silence
magnified
that
uneven
surface
in
reality
dark
of
hue
but
made
brilliant
by
the
dreamer
then
it
was
beautiful
with
its
meagre
vegetation
its
camomile
its
venus
hair
with
the
velvety
leaves
a
prolonged
festivity
superb
decorations
placid
exaltation
of
human
strength
once
before
the
lake
of
bienne
seen
from
île
had
spoken
to
me
thus
perhaps
the
cliff
of
le
croisic
would
be
the
last
of
those
delights
but
in
that
case
what
would
become
of
pauline
you
have
had
fine
luck
this
morning
my
good
man
i
said
to
the
fisherman
yes
monsieur
he
replied
stopping
to
turn
towards
us
the
tanned
face
of
those
who
remain
for
hours
at
a
time
exposed
to
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
the
water
that
face
indicated
endless
resignation
the
patience
of
the
fisherman
and
his
gentle
manners
that
man
had
a
voice
without
trace
of
harshness
kindly
lips
no
ambition
an
indefinably
frail
and
sickly
appearance
any
other
type
of
face
would
have
displeased
us
where
are
you
going
to
sell
your
fish
at
the
town
how
much
will
you
get
for
the
lobster
fifteen
sous
and
for
the
crab
twenty
sous
why
so
much
difference
between
the
lobster
and
the
crab
the
crab
is
much
more
delicate
monsieur
and
then
it
as
cunning
as
a
monkey
and
do
often
allow
itself
to
be
caught
will
you
let
us
have
both
for
a
hundred
sous
said
pauline
the
man
was
thunderstruck
you
have
them
i
said
laughingly
i
will
give
ten
francs
we
must
pay
for
emotions
all
that
they
are
worth
very
well
she
replied
i
propose
to
have
them
i
will
give
ten
francs
two
sous
ten
sous
twelve
francs
fifteen
francs
fifteen
francs
fifty
she
said
one
hundred
francs
one
hundred
and
fifty
i
bowed
at
that
moment
we
were
not
rich
enough
to
carry
the
bidding
any
farther
the
poor
fisherman
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
be
angry
as
at
a
practical
joke
or
to
exult
we
relieved
him
from
his
dilemma
by
giving
him
the
name
of
our
landlady
and
telling
him
to
take
the
lobster
and
the
crab
to
her
house
do
you
earn
a
living
i
asked
him
in
order
to
ascertain
to
what
cause
his
destitution
should
be
attributed
with
much
difficulty
and
many
hardships
he
replied
fishing
on
the
seashore
when
you
have
neither
boat
nor
nets
and
can
fish
only
with
a
line
is
a
risky
trade
you
see
you
have
to
wait
for
the
fish
or
the
to
come
while
the
fishermen
with
boats
can
go
out
to
sea
after
them
it
is
so
hard
to
earn
a
living
this
way
that
i
am
the
only
man
who
fishes
on
the
shore
i
pass
whole
days
without
catching
anything
the
only
way
i
get
anything
is
when
a
crab
forgets
himself
and
goes
to
sleep
as
this
one
did
or
a
lobster
is
fool
enough
to
stay
on
the
rocks
sometimes
after
a
high
sea
the
come
in
and
then
i
grab
them
well
take
one
day
with
another
what
do
you
earn
eleven
or
twelve
sous
i
could
get
along
with
that
if
i
were
alone
but
i
have
my
father
to
support
and
the
poor
man
ca
help
me
for
he
blind
at
that
sentence
uttered
with
perfect
simplicity
pauline
and
i
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
you
have
a
wife
or
a
sweetheart
he
cast
at
us
one
of
the
most
pitiful
glances
that
i
ever
saw
as
he
replied
if
i
had
a
wife
then
i
should
have
to
let
my
father
go
i
support
him
and
a
wife
and
children
too
well
my
poor
fellow
how
is
it
that
you
do
try
to
earn
more
by
carrying
salt
to
the
harbour
or
by
working
in
the
salt
marshes
oh
i
could
do
that
for
three
months
monsieur
i
am
not
strong
enough
and
if
i
should
die
my
father
would
have
to
beg
what
i
must
have
is
a
trade
that
requires
very
little
skill
and
a
great
deal
of
patience
but
how
can
two
people
live
on
twelve
sous
a
day
oh
monsieur
we
eat
buckwheat
cakes
and
barnacles
that
i
take
off
the
rocks
how
old
are
you
have
you
ever
been
away
from
here
i
went
to
guérande
once
to
draw
my
lot
in
the
draft
and
i
went
to
savenay
to
show
myself
to
some
gentlemen
who
measured
me
if
i
had
been
an
inch
taller
i
should
have
been
drafted
i
should
have
died
on
the
first
long
march
and
my
poor
father
would
have
been
asking
alms
i
had
thought
out
many
dramas
pauline
was
accustomed
to
intense
emotions
living
with
a
man
in
my
condition
of
health
but
neither
of
us
had
ever
listened
to
more
touching
words
than
those
of
that
fisherman
we
walked
some
distance
in
silence
both
of
us
measuring
the
silent
depths
of
that
unknown
life
admiring
the
nobility
of
that
which
was
unconscious
of
itself
the
strength
of
his
weakness
surprised
us
that
unconscious
generosity
made
us
small
in
our
own
eyes
i
saw
that
poor
creature
all
instinct
chained
to
that
rock
as
a
is
chained
to
his
ball
watching
for
twenty
years
for
to
support
himself
and
sustained
in
his
patience
by
a
single
sentiment
how
many
hours
passed
on
the
edge
of
that
beach
how
many
hopes
crushed
by
a
squall
by
a
change
of
weather
he
hung
over
the
edge
of
a
granite
shelf
his
arms
stretched
out
like
those
of
an
indian
fakir
while
his
father
sitting
on
a
stool
waited
in
silence
and
darkness
for
him
to
bring
him
the
coarsest
of
and
of
bread
if
the
sea
were
willing
do
you
ever
drink
wine
i
asked
him
three
or
four
times
a
year
well
you
shall
drink
some
you
and
your
father
and
we
will
send
you
a
white
loaf
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
we
will
give
you
your
dinner
if
you
will
guide
us
along
the
shore
as
far
as
batz
where
we
are
going
to
see
the
tower
which
overlooks
the
basin
and
the
coast
between
batz
and
le
croisic
with
pleasure
he
said
go
straight
ahead
follow
the
road
you
are
now
on
i
will
overtake
you
after
i
have
got
rid
of
my
fish
and
my
tackle
we
nodded
simultaneously
and
he
hurried
off
towards
the
town
light
at
heart
that
meeting
held
us
in
the
same
mental
situation
in
which
we
were
previously
but
it
had
lowered
our
spirits
poor
man
said
pauline
with
that
accent
which
takes
away
from
a
woman
compassion
whatever
there
may
be
offensive
in
pity
does
it
not
make
one
feel
ashamed
to
be
happy
when
one
sees
such
misery
nothing
is
more
cruel
than
to
have
impotent
desires
i
replied
those
two
poor
creatures
father
and
son
will
no
more
know
how
keen
our
sympathy
is
than
the
world
knows
how
noble
their
lives
are
for
they
are
laying
up
treasures
in
heaven
what
a
wretched
country
she
said
as
she
pointed
out
to
me
along
a
field
surrounded
by
a
loose
stone
wall
lumps
of
arranged
symmetrically
i
asked
some
one
what
those
were
a
peasant
woman
who
was
putting
them
in
place
answered
that
she
was
just
fancy
my
dear
that
when
these
blocks
of
dung
are
dried
these
poor
people
gather
them
pile
them
up
and
warm
themselves
with
them
during
the
winter
they
are
sold
like
lumps
of
peat
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
best
paid
dressmaker
earns
five
sous
a
day
she
said
after
a
pause
but
she
gets
her
board
see
i
said
to
her
the
winds
from
the
ocean
wither
or
uproot
everything
there
are
no
trees
the
wrecks
of
vessels
that
are
beyond
use
are
sold
to
the
rich
for
the
cost
of
transportation
prevents
them
from
using
the
firewood
in
which
brittany
abounds
this
province
is
beautiful
only
to
great
souls
people
without
courage
could
not
live
here
it
is
no
place
for
anybody
except
poets
or
barnacles
the
storehouse
for
salt
had
to
be
built
on
the
cliff
to
induce
anybody
to
live
in
it
on
one
side
the
sea
on
the
other
the
sands
above
space
we
had
already
passed
the
town
and
were
within
the
species
of
desert
which
separates
le
croisic
from
the
village
of
batz
imagine
my
dear
uncle
a
plain
two
leagues
in
length
covered
by
the
gleaming
sand
that
we
see
on
the
seashore
here
and
there
a
few
rocks
raised
their
heads
and
you
would
have
said
that
they
were
gigantic
beasts
lying
among
the
dunes
along
the
shore
there
is
an
occasional
reef
about
which
the
waves
play
giving
them
the
aspect
of
great
white
roses
floating
on
the
liquid
expanse
and
coming
to
rest
on
the
shore
when
i
saw
that
plain
bounded
by
the
ocean
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
by
the
great
lake
that
flows
in
between
le
croisic
and
the
sandy
heights
of
guérande
at
the
foot
of
which
there
are
salt
marshes
absolutely
without
vegetation
i
glanced
at
pauline
and
asked
her
if
she
had
the
courage
to
defy
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
strength
to
walk
through
the
sand
i
have
on
high
boots
let
us
go
thither
she
said
pointing
to
the
tower
of
batz
which
circumscribed
the
view
by
its
enormous
mass
placed
there
like
a
pyramid
but
a
slender
indented
pyramid
so
poetically
adorned
that
it
allowed
the
imagination
to
see
in
it
the
first
ruins
of
a
great
asiatic
city
we
walked
a
few
yards
and
sat
down
under
a
rock
which
was
still
in
the
shadow
but
it
was
eleven
in
the
morning
and
that
shadow
which
ceased
at
our
feet
rapidly
disappeared
how
beautiful
the
silence
is
she
said
to
me
and
how
its
intensity
is
increased
by
the
regular
plashing
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
if
you
choose
to
abandon
your
understanding
to
the
three
immensities
that
surround
us
the
air
the
water
and
the
sand
listening
solely
to
the
repeated
sound
of
the
flow
and
the
outflow
i
replied
you
will
not
be
able
to
endure
its
language
you
will
fancy
that
you
discover
therein
a
thought
which
will
overwhelm
you
yesterday
at
sunset
i
had
that
sensation
it
prostrated
me
oh
yes
let
us
talk
she
said
after
a
long
pause
no
orator
can
be
more
terrible
than
this
silence
i
fancy
that
i
have
discovered
the
causes
of
the
harmony
which
surrounds
us
she
continued
this
landscape
which
has
only
three
sharp
colours
the
brilliant
yellow
of
the
sand
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
smooth
green
of
the
sea
is
grand
without
being
wild
it
is
immense
without
being
a
desert
it
is
changeless
without
being
monotonous
it
has
only
three
elements
but
it
is
diversified
women
alone
can
express
their
impressions
thus
i
replied
you
would
drive
a
poet
to
despair
dear
heart
whom
i
divined
so
perfectly
the
excessive
noonday
heat
imparts
a
gorgeous
colour
to
those
three
expressions
of
infinity
replied
pauline
laughing
i
can
imagine
here
the
poesy
and
the
passion
of
the
orient
and
i
can
imagine
its
despair
yes
she
said
that
dune
is
a
sublime
cloister
we
heard
the
hurried
step
of
our
guide
he
had
dressed
himself
in
his
best
clothes
we
said
a
few
formal
words
to
him
he
evidently
saw
that
our
frame
of
mind
had
changed
and
with
the
reserve
that
misfortune
imparts
he
kept
silent
although
we
pressed
each
hands
from
time
to
time
to
advise
each
other
of
the
unity
of
our
impressions
we
walked
for
half
an
hour
in
silence
whether
because
we
were
overwhelmed
by
the
heat
which
rose
in
shimmering
waves
from
the
sand
or
because
the
difficulty
of
walking
absorbed
our
attention
we
walked
on
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
we
should
not
have
taken
a
dozen
steps
if
we
had
been
arm
in
arm
the
road
leading
to
batz
was
not
marked
out
a
gust
of
wind
was
enough
to
efface
the
footprints
of
horses
or
the
but
our
guide
practised
eye
recognised
the
road
by
the
droppings
of
cattle
or
of
horses
sometimes
it
went
down
towards
the
sea
sometimes
rose
towards
the
upland
at
the
caprice
of
the
slopes
or
to
skirt
a
rock
at
noon
we
were
only
we
will
rest
there
said
i
pointing
to
a
promontory
formed
of
rocks
high
enough
to
lead
one
to
suppose
that
we
should
find
a
grotto
there
when
i
spoke
the
fisherman
who
had
followed
the
direction
of
my
finger
shook
his
head
and
said
there
some
one
there
people
who
go
from
batz
to
le
croisic
or
from
le
croisic
to
batz
always
make
a
detour
in
order
not
to
pass
that
rock
the
man
said
this
in
a
low
voice
and
we
divined
a
mystery
is
he
a
thief
an
assassin
our
guide
replied
only
by
a
breath
which
increased
our
curiosity
but
will
anything
happen
to
us
if
we
pass
by
there
oh
no
will
you
go
with
us
no
monsieur
we
will
go
then
if
you
assure
us
that
we
shall
be
in
no
danger
i
do
say
that
replied
the
fisherman
hastily
i
say
simply
that
the
man
who
is
there
wo
say
anything
to
you
or
do
any
harm
to
you
oh
bless
my
soul
he
wo
so
much
as
move
from
his
place
who
is
he
pray
a
man
never
were
two
syllables
uttered
in
such
a
tragic
tone
at
that
moment
we
were
twenty
yards
from
that
reef
about
which
the
sea
was
playing
our
guide
took
the
road
which
skirted
the
rocks
we
went
straight
ahead
but
pauline
took
my
arm
our
guide
quickened
his
pace
in
order
to
reach
the
spot
where
the
two
roads
met
again
at
the
same
time
that
we
did
he
evidently
supposed
that
after
seeing
the
man
we
would
quicken
our
pace
that
circumstance
kindled
our
curiosity
which
then
became
so
intense
that
our
hearts
throbbed
as
if
they
had
felt
a
thrill
of
fear
despite
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
fatigue
caused
by
walking
through
the
sand
our
hearts
were
still
abandoned
to
the
indescribable
languor
of
a
blissful
harmony
of
sensations
they
were
filled
with
that
pure
pleasure
which
can
only
be
described
by
comparing
it
to
the
pleasure
which
one
feels
in
listening
to
some
lovely
music
like
mozart
mio
do
not
two
pure
sentiments
which
blend
resemble
two
beautiful
voices
singing
in
order
fully
to
appreciate
the
emotion
which
seized
us
you
must
share
the
semivoluptuous
condition
in
which
the
events
of
that
morning
had
enveloped
us
gaze
for
a
long
while
at
a
perched
on
a
slender
twig
near
a
spring
and
you
will
utter
a
cry
of
pain
when
you
see
a
hawk
pounce
upon
it
bury
its
steel
claws
in
its
heart
and
bear
it
away
with
the
murderous
rapidity
that
powder
communicates
to
the
bullet
when
we
had
walked
a
yard
or
two
across
the
open
space
that
lay
in
front
of
the
grotto
a
sort
of
platform
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ocean
and
sheltered
from
its
rage
by
a
succession
of
steep
rocks
we
were
conscious
of
an
electric
shock
not
unlike
that
caused
by
a
sudden
noise
in
the
midst
of
the
night
we
had
spied
a
man
seated
on
a
bowlder
of
granite
and
he
had
looked
at
us
his
glance
like
the
flash
of
a
cannon
came
from
two
bloodshot
eyes
and
his
stoical
immobility
could
be
compared
only
to
the
unchanging
posture
of
the
masses
of
granite
which
surrounded
him
his
eyes
moved
slowly
his
body
as
if
it
were
petrified
did
not
move
at
all
after
flashing
at
us
that
glance
which
gave
us
such
a
rude
shock
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
vast
expanse
of
the
ocean
and
gazed
at
it
despite
the
dazzling
light
which
rose
therefrom
as
the
eagles
are
said
to
gaze
at
the
sun
without
lowering
the
lids
which
he
did
not
raise
again
try
to
recall
my
dear
uncle
one
of
those
old
druidical
oaks
whose
gnarled
trunk
newly
stripped
of
its
branches
rises
fantastically
above
a
deserted
road
and
you
will
have
an
accurate
image
of
that
man
he
had
one
of
those
shattered
herculean
frames
and
the
face
of
olympian
jove
but
ravaged
by
age
by
the
hard
toil
of
the
seafaring
man
by
grief
by
coarse
food
and
blackened
as
if
struck
by
lightning
as
i
glanced
at
his
calloused
hairy
hands
i
saw
chords
which
resembled
veins
of
iron
however
everything
about
him
indicated
a
robust
constitution
i
noticed
a
large
quantity
of
moss
in
a
corner
of
the
grotto
and
upon
a
rough
table
hewn
out
by
chance
in
the
midst
of
the
granite
a
broken
loaf
covering
an
earthen
jug
never
had
my
imagination
when
it
carried
me
back
to
the
deserts
where
the
first
hermits
of
christianity
lived
conceived
a
face
more
grandly
religious
or
more
appallingly
penitent
than
was
the
face
of
that
man
even
you
who
have
listened
to
confessions
my
dear
uncle
have
perhaps
never
met
with
such
sublime
remorse
but
that
remorse
was
drowned
in
the
waves
of
prayer
the
incessant
prayer
of
silent
despair
that
fisherman
that
sailor
that
rude
breton
was
sublime
by
virtue
of
some
unknown
sentiment
but
had
those
eyes
wept
had
that
statuelike
hand
struck
its
fellow
man
was
that
stern
forehead
instinct
with
pitiless
uprightness
on
which
however
strength
had
left
those
marks
of
gentleness
which
are
the
accompaniment
of
all
true
strength
was
that
forehead
furrowed
by
wrinkles
in
harmony
with
a
noble
heart
why
was
that
man
among
the
granite
why
the
granite
in
that
man
where
was
the
man
where
was
the
granite
a
whole
world
of
thoughts
rushed
through
our
minds
as
our
guide
had
anticipated
we
had
passed
in
silence
rapidly
and
when
he
met
us
we
were
tremulous
with
terror
or
overwhelmed
with
amazement
but
he
did
not
use
the
fulfillment
of
his
prediction
as
a
weapon
against
us
did
you
see
him
he
asked
who
is
that
man
said
i
they
call
him
man
of
the
you
can
imagine
how
quickly
our
two
faces
turned
towards
our
fisherman
at
those
words
he
was
a
man
he
understood
our
silent
question
and
this
is
what
he
said
in
his
own
language
the
popular
tone
of
which
i
shall
try
to
retain
madame
the
people
of
le
croisic
like
the
people
of
batz
believe
that
that
man
is
guilty
of
something
and
that
he
is
doing
a
penance
ordered
by
a
famous
priest
to
whom
he
went
to
confess
a
long
way
beyond
nantes
other
people
think
that
cambremer
that
his
name
has
an
evil
spell
that
he
communicates
to
everybody
who
passes
through
the
air
he
breathes
so
a
good
many
people
before
they
pass
that
rock
look
to
see
what
way
the
wind
is
if
it
from
he
said
pointing
towards
the
west
they
would
go
on
even
if
it
was
a
matter
of
searching
for
a
piece
of
the
true
cross
they
turn
back
because
they
frightened
other
people
the
rich
people
of
le
croisic
say
that
he
made
a
vow
and
that
why
he
called
man
of
the
he
is
always
there
night
and
day
never
comes
out
these
reports
about
him
have
some
appearance
of
sense
you
see
he
added
turning
to
point
out
a
thing
which
we
had
not
noticed
he
has
stuck
up
there
on
the
left
a
wooden
cross
to
show
that
he
has
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
god
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
saints
even
if
he
had
consecrated
himself
like
that
the
fear
everybody
has
of
him
would
make
him
as
safe
there
as
if
he
were
guarded
by
soldiers
he
has
said
a
word
since
he
shut
himself
up
there
in
the
open
air
he
lives
on
bread
and
water
that
his
brother
daughter
brings
him
every
morning
a
little
maid
of
twelve
years
that
he
left
his
property
to
and
she
a
pretty
thing
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
a
nice
little
girl
and
very
clever
she
has
blue
eyes
as
long
as
that
he
said
holding
up
his
thumb
and
a
cherub
head
of
hair
when
any
one
says
to
her
say
pérotte
that
means
pierrette
among
us
he
said
interrupting
himself
she
is
consecrated
to
pierre
name
is
pierre
and
he
was
her
godfather
say
pérotte
what
does
your
uncle
say
to
you
do
say
anything
she
answer
anything
at
all
nothing
then
what
does
he
do
to
you
kisses
me
on
the
forehead
sundays
you
afraid
of
him
no
he
my
godfather
he
wo
let
any
one
else
bring
him
anything
to
eat
pérotte
says
that
he
smiles
when
she
comes
but
that
like
a
sunbeam
in
a
fog
for
they
say
he
as
gloomy
as
a
fog
but
i
said
you
arouse
our
curiosity
without
gratifying
it
do
you
know
what
brought
him
here
was
it
grief
was
it
repentance
was
it
insanity
was
it
a
crime
was
it
oh
only
my
father
and
i
know
the
truth
of
the
thing
monsieur
my
dead
mother
worked
for
a
judge
to
whom
cambremer
told
the
whole
story
by
the
priest
order
for
he
would
give
him
absolution
on
any
other
condition
according
to
what
the
people
at
the
harbour
said
my
poor
mother
overheard
what
cambremer
said
without
meaning
to
because
the
judge
kitchen
was
right
next
to
his
study
and
she
listened
dead
and
the
judge
who
heard
him
is
dead
my
mother
made
father
and
me
promise
never
to
tell
anything
to
the
people
about
here
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
night
my
mother
told
it
to
us
the
hair
on
my
head
turned
gray
well
tell
us
my
fine
fellow
we
will
not
mention
it
to
anybody
the
fisherman
looked
at
us
and
continued
thus
pierre
cambremer
whom
you
saw
yonder
is
the
oldest
of
the
cambremers
who
have
always
been
sailors
from
father
to
son
what
their
name
says
the
sea
has
always
bent
under
them
the
man
you
saw
was
a
boat
fisherman
so
he
had
boats
and
went
he
went
fishing
too
for
the
dealers
he
have
fitted
out
a
vessel
and
gone
after
cod
if
he
had
been
so
fond
of
his
wife
a
fine
woman
she
was
a
brouin
from
guérande
a
magnificent
girl
and
she
had
a
big
heart
she
was
so
fond
of
cambremer
that
she
never
let
her
man
leave
her
any
longer
than
he
had
to
to
go
after
sardines
they
used
to
live
over
there
look
said
the
fisherman
ascending
a
hillock
to
point
to
an
islet
in
the
little
inland
sea
between
the
dunes
across
which
we
were
walking
and
the
salt
marshes
of
guérande
do
you
see
that
house
that
was
his
jacquette
brouin
and
cambremer
never
had
but
one
child
a
boy
and
they
loved
him
like
like
what
shall
i
say
indeed
like
people
love
their
only
child
they
were
mad
over
him
if
their
little
jacques
had
put
dirt
in
the
saucepan
saving
your
presence
they
have
thought
it
was
sugar
how
many
times
we
seen
at
the
fair
buying
the
prettiest
fallals
for
him
it
was
all
nonsense
everybody
told
so
little
cambremer
seeing
that
he
was
allowed
to
do
whatever
he
wanted
to
became
as
big
a
rogue
as
a
red
ass
when
any
one
went
to
the
elder
cambremer
and
told
him
boy
nearly
killed
little
he
laugh
and
say
he
make
a
fine
sailor
he
command
the
king
fleet
and
when
somebody
else
said
cambremer
do
you
know
that
your
boy
put
out
the
little
pougaud
girl
eye
pierre
said
be
fond
of
the
girls
he
thought
everything
was
all
right
so
my
little
scamp
when
he
was
ten
years
old
used
to
be
at
everybody
and
amuse
himself
cutting
off
hens
heads
cutting
pigs
open
in
short
he
rolled
in
blood
like
a
polecat
make
a
famous
soldier
cambremer
would
say
s
got
a
taste
for
blood
i
remembered
all
that
you
see
said
the
fisherman
and
so
did
cambremer
too
he
continued
after
a
pause
when
he
got
to
be
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
jacques
cambremer
was
what
shall
i
say
a
shark
he
used
to
go
to
guérande
to
enjoy
himself
or
to
savenay
to
make
love
to
the
girls
then
he
began
to
steal
from
his
mother
who
did
dare
to
say
anything
to
her
husband
cambremer
was
so
honest
that
he
travel
twenty
leagues
to
pay
back
two
sous
if
he
had
been
overpaid
in
settling
an
account
at
last
the
day
came
when
his
mother
was
stripped
clean
while
his
father
was
away
fishing
the
boy
carried
off
the
sideboard
the
dishes
the
sheets
the
linen
and
left
just
the
four
walls
he
sold
everything
to
get
money
to
go
to
nantes
and
raise
the
devil
the
poor
woman
cried
for
whole
days
and
nights
she
could
help
telling
the
father
about
that
when
he
came
home
and
she
was
afraid
of
the
father
not
for
herself
oh
no
when
pierre
cambremer
came
home
and
found
his
house
furnished
with
things
people
had
lent
his
wife
he
said
does
all
this
mean
the
poor
woman
was
nearer
dead
than
alive
been
robbed
said
she
jacques
is
on
a
spree
no
one
knew
where
the
villain
had
gone
goes
on
too
many
sprees
said
pierre
six
months
later
the
poor
man
learned
that
his
son
was
in
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
justice
at
nantes
he
went
there
on
foot
made
the
journey
faster
than
he
could
have
gone
by
sea
got
hold
of
his
son
and
brought
him
back
here
he
did
ask
him
have
you
been
doing
he
just
said
to
him
you
do
behave
yourself
here
with
your
mother
and
me
for
two
years
going
fishing
and
acting
like
an
honest
man
you
have
an
account
to
settle
with
me
the
idiot
counting
on
his
father
and
mother
stupidity
made
a
face
at
him
at
that
pierre
fetched
him
a
crack
that
laid
master
jacques
up
in
bed
for
six
months
the
poor
mother
almost
died
of
grief
one
night
when
she
was
sleeping
peacefully
by
her
husband
side
she
heard
a
noise
got
out
of
bed
and
got
a
on
her
arm
she
shrieked
and
some
one
brought
a
light
pierre
cambremer
found
his
wife
wounded
he
thought
that
a
robber
did
it
as
if
there
was
any
such
thing
in
our
province
where
you
can
carry
ten
thousand
francs
in
gold
from
le
croisic
to
without
fear
and
without
once
being
asked
what
you
got
under
your
arm
pierre
looked
for
jacques
but
could
find
him
in
the
morning
the
little
monster
had
the
face
to
come
home
and
say
that
he
been
to
batz
i
must
tell
you
that
his
mother
know
where
to
hide
her
money
cambremer
always
left
his
with
monsieur
dupotet
at
le
croisic
their
son
wild
ways
had
eaten
up
crowns
by
the
hundred
francs
by
the
hundred
and
louis
they
were
almost
ruined
and
that
was
pretty
hard
for
folks
who
used
to
have
about
twelve
thousand
francs
including
their
island
no
one
knew
what
cambremer
paid
out
at
nantes
to
clear
his
son
bad
luck
raised
the
deuce
with
the
family
cambremer
brother
was
in
a
bad
way
and
needed
help
to
encourage
him
pierre
told
him
that
jacques
and
pérotte
the
younger
cambremer
daughter
should
marry
then
he
employed
him
in
the
fishing
so
that
he
could
earn
his
living
for
joseph
cambremer
was
reduced
to
living
by
his
work
his
wife
had
died
of
a
fever
and
he
had
had
to
pay
for
a

pérotte
pierre
cambremer

a
hundred
francs
to
different
people

the
little

had
a
good
education

could
write
like
a
clerk
and
she
taught
her
son
to
read
that
was
the
ruin
of
him
no
one
knew
how
it
happened
but
that
scamp
of
a
jacques
scented
the
gold
stole
it
and
went
off
to
le
croisic
on
a
spree
as
luck
would
have
it
goodman
cambremer
came
in
with
his
boat
as
he
approached
the
beach

saw
a
piece
of
paper
floating

picked
it
up
and
took
it
in
to
his
wife
who
fell
flat
when
she
recognised
her
own
written
words
cambremer
did
say
anything
but
he
went
to
le
croisic
and
found
out
that
his

was
playing
billiards

he
sent
for

right
and
went
home

whole
town

about
that
but
something
that
i
know
and
that
other
people
only
suspect
in
a
general
way
he
told
his
wife
to
clean
up
their
room
which
was
on
the
ground
floor
he
made
a
fire
on
the
hearth

side
of
the
fireplace

a
stool
on

the
beaches
this
one
or
the
one
in
front
of
the
guérande
salt
marshes
when
he
thought
that
his
wife
was
dressed
he
went
home
again
loaded
a
gun
and
put
it
out
of
sight
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
jacques
came
at
last
it
was
late
he
had
been
drinking
and
playing
billiards
till
ten
he
had
come
home
by
the
point
of
carnouf
his
uncle
heard
him
hailing
crossed
to
the
beach
in
front
of
the
marsh
to
fetch
him
and
rowed
him
to
the
island
without
a
word
when
he
went
into
the
house
his
father
said
to
him
down
there
pointing
to
the
stool
are
before
your
father
and
mother
whom
you
have
outraged
and
who
have
got
to
try
you
jacques
began
to
bellow
because
cambremer
face
was
working
in
a
strange
way
the
mother
sat
as
stiff
as
an
oar
you
call
out
if
you
move
if
you
do
sit
on
your
stool
as
straight
as
a
mast
i
shoot
you
like
a
dog
said
pierre
pointing
his
gun
at
him
the
son
was
dumb
as
a
fish
the
mother
did
say
anything
said
pierre
to
his
son
a
paper
that
was
wrapped
round
a
spanish
the
was
in
your
mother
bed
nobody
else
knew
where
she
had
put
it
i
found
the
paper
on
the
water
as
i
was
coming
ashore
you
gave
this
spanish
to
mother
fleurant
and
your
mother
ca
find
hers
in
her
bed
explain
yourself
jacques
said
that
he
did
take
the
money
from
his
mother
and
that
he
had
had
the
coin
ever
since
he
went
to
nantes
much
the
better
said
pierre
can
you
prove
it
had
it
before
did
take
your
mother
you
swear
it
by
your
everlasting
life
he
was
going
to
swear
his
mother
looked
up
at
him
and
said
my
child
be
careful
do
swear
if
it
is
true
you
may
mend
your
ways
and
repent
there
time
enough
still
and
she
began
to
cry
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
he
said
you
always
wanted
to
ruin
me
cambremer
turned
pale
and
said
you
just
said
to
your
mother
will
lengthen
your
account
come
to
the
point
will
you
swear
said
pierre
your
piece
have
this
cross
which
the
who
paid
it
to
me
had
made
on
ours
jacques
sobered
off
and
began
to
cry
talk
said
pierre
do
say
anything
about
what
done
before
this
i
do
propose
that
a
cambremer
shall
be
put
to
death
on
the
public
square
at
le
croisic
say
your
prayers
and
make
haste
a
priest
is
coming
to
confess
you
the
mother
went
out
so
that
she
need
hear
her
son
sentence
when
she
had
left
the
room
cambremer
the
uncle
arrived
with
the
rector
of
piriac
but
jacques
would
say
anything
to
him
he
was
sly
he
knew
his
father
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
would
kill
him
without
confession
you
monsieur
excuse
us
said
cambremer
to
the
priest
when
he
saw
that
jacques
was
obstinate
meant
to
give
my
son
a
lesson
and
i
ask
you
not
to
say
anything
about
if
you
do
mend
your
ways
he
said
to
jacques
next
time
will
be
the
last
and
put
an
end
to
it
without
confession
he
sent
him
off
to
bed
the
boy
believed
what
he
had
heard
and
imagined
that
he
could
arrange
matters
with
his
father
he
went
to
sleep
the
father
sat
up
when
he
saw
that
his
son
was
sound
asleep
he
stuffed
his
mouth
with
hemp
and
tied
a
strip
of
canvas
over
it
very
tight
then
he
bound
his
hands
and
feet
jacques
stormed
and
wept
blood
so
cambremer
told
the
judge
what
could
you
expect
the
mother
threw
herself
at
the
father
feet
has
been
tried
he
said
must
help
me
put
him
in
the
boat
she
refused
cambremer
took
him
to
the
boat
all
alone
laid
him
in
the
bottom
tied
a
stone
round
his
neck
and
rowed
abreast
of
the
rock
where
he
is
now
then
the
poor
mother
who
had
got
her
to
bring
her
over
here
cried
all
in
vain
it
had
the
effect
of
a
stone
thrown
at
a
wolf
the
moon
was
shining
she
saw
the
father
throw
their
son
into
the
water
the
son
to
whom
her
heart
still
clung
and
as
there
was
any
wind
she
heard
a
splash
then
nothing
more
not
a
sound
or
a
bubble
the
sea
a
famous
keeper
i
tell
you
when
he
came
ashore
here
to
quiet
his
wife
who
was
groaning
cambremer
found
her
about
the
same
as
dead
the
two
brothers
could
carry
her
so
they
had
to
put
her
in
the
boat
that
had
just
held
the
son
and
they
took
her
home
going
round
through
le
croisic
passage
ah
belle
as
they
called
her
did
last
a
week
she
died
asking
her
husband
to
burn
the
accursed
boat
he
did
it
too
as
for
him
he
was
like
a
crazy
man
he
did
know
what
he
wanted
and
he
staggered
when
he
walked
like
a
man
who
ca
carry
his
wine
then
he
went
off
for
ten
days
and
when
he
came
back
he
planted
himself
where
you
saw
him
and
since
he
been
there
he
has
said
a
word
the
fisherman
took
only
a
moment
or
two
in
telling
us
this
story
and
he
told
it
even
more
simply
than
i
have
written
it
the
common
people
make
few
comments
when
they
tell
a
story
they
select
the
point
that
has
made
an
impression
on
them
and
interpret
it
as
they
feel
it
that
narrative
was
as
sharp
and
incisive
as
a
blow
with
an
axe
i
shall
not
go
to
batz
said
pauline
as
we
reached
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
we
returned
to
le
croisic
by
way
of
the
salt
marshes
guided
through
their
labyrinth
by
a
fisherman
who
had
become
as
silent
as
we
the
current
of
our
thoughts
had
changed
we
were
both
absorbed
by
depressing
reflections
saddened
by
that
drama
which
explained
the
swift
presentiment
that
we
had
felt
at
the
sight
of
cambremer
we
both
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
world
to
divine
all
that
our
guide
had
not
told
us
of
that
triple
life
the
misfortunes
of
those
three
people
were
reproduced
before
us
as
if
we
had
seen
them
in
the
successive
scenes
of
a
drama
to
which
that
father
by
thus
expiating
his
necessary
crime
had
added
the
dénouement
we
dared
not
look
back
at
that
fatal
man
who
terrified
a
whole
province
a
few
clouds
darkened
the
sky
vapours
were
rising
along
the
horizon
we
were
walking
through
the
most
distressingly
desolate
tract
of
land
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
very
soil
beneath
our
feet
seemed
sickly
and
suffering
salt
marshes
which
may
justly
be
termed
the
scrofula
of
the
earth
there
the
ground
is
divided
into
parcels
of
unequal
size
all
enclosed
by
enormous
heaps
of
gray
earth
and
filled
with
brackish
water
to
the
surface
of
which
the
salt
rises
these
ravines
made
by
the
hand
of
man
are
subdivided
by
causeways
along
which
workmen
walk
armed
with
long
rakes
with
which
they
skim
off
the
brine
and
carry
the
salt
to
round
platforms
built
here
and
there
when
it
is
in
condition
to
pile
for
two
hours
we
skirted
that
dismal
where
the
salt
is
so
abundant
that
it
chokes
the
vegetation
and
where
we
saw
no
other
living
beings
than
an
occasional
the
name
given
to
the
men
who
gather
the
salt
these
men
or
rather
this
tribe
of
bretons
wear
a
special
costume
a
white
jacket
not
unlike
that
worn
by
brewers
they
intermarry
and
there
has
never
been
an
instance
of
a
girl
of
that
tribe
marrying
anybody
except
a
the
ghastly
aspect
of
those
swamps
where
the
surface
of
the
mire
is
neatly
raked
and
of
that
grayish
soil
which
the
breton
flora
holds
in
horror
harmonised
with
the
mourning
of
our
hearts
when
we
reached
the
place
where
we
were
to
cross
the
arm
of
the
sea
which
is
formed
by
the
eruption
of
the
water
into
that
basin
and
which
serves
doubtless
to
supply
the
salt
marshes
with
their
staple
we
rejoiced
to
see
the
meagre
vegetation
scattered
along
the
sandy
shore
as
we
crossed
we
saw
in
the
centre
of
the
lake
the
islet
where
the
cambremers
lived
we
looked
the
other
way
when
we
reached
our
hotel
we
noticed
a
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
when
we
learned
that
it
was
the
only
public
in
le
croisic
we
prepared
for
our
departure
that
night
the
next
day
we
were
at
guérande
pauline
was
still
depressed
and
i
could
already
feel
the
coming
of
the
flame
that
is
consuming
my
brain
i
was
so
cruelly
tormented
by
my
visions
of
those
three
lives
that
she
said
to
me
write
the
story
louis
in
that
way
you
will
change
the
nature
of
this
fever
so
i
have
written
it
down
for
you
my
dear
uncle
but
it
has
already
destroyed
the
tranquillity
that
i
owed
to
the
and
to
our
visit
here
an
episode
under
the
terror
to
monsieur
would
it
not
be
well
for
me
my
dear
former
master
to
explain
to
those
people
who
are
curious
to
know
everything
where
i
was
able
to
learn
enough
of
legal
procedure
to
manage
the
business
of
my
little
circle
and
at
the
same
time
to
consecrate
here
the
memory
of
the
amiable
and
intellectual
man
who
said
to
scribe
another
amateur
lawyer
on
meeting
him
at
a
ball
go
to
the
office
i
promise
you
that
there
is
work
enough
there
but
do
you
need
this
public
testimony
in
order
to
be
assured
of
the
affection
de
balzac
on
the
of
january
about
eight
in
the
evening
an
old
lady
was
descending
the
steep
hill
which
ends
in
front
of
the
church
of
on
faubourg
paris
it
had
snowed
so
hard
all
day
that
footfalls
could
scarcely
be
heard
the
streets
were
deserted
the
not
unnatural
dread
inspired
by
the
silence
was
intensified
by
the
terror
under
which
france
was
then
groaning
so
that
the
old
lady
had
not
as
yet
met
anybody
her
sight
which
had
long
been
poor
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
see
in
the
distance
by
the
dim
light
of
the
the
few
people
who
were
scattered
about
like
ghosts
in
the
broad
highway
of
the
faubourg
she
went
her
way
courageously
alone
through
that
solitude
as
if
her
age
were
a
talisman
certain
to
preserve
her
from
all
evil
when
she
had
passed
rue
des
morts
she
fancied
that
she
could
distinguish
the
firm
and
heavy
step
of
a
man
walking
behind
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
heard
that
sound
she
was
terrified
at
the
thought
that
she
had
been
followed
and
she
tried
to
walk
even
faster
in
order
to
reach
a
brightly
lighted
shop
hoping
to
be
able
to
set
at
rest
in
the
light
the
suspicions
which
had
seized
her
as
soon
as
she
had
stepped
beyond
the
horizontal
rays
of
light
that
shone
from
the
shop
she
suddenly
turned
her
head
and
caught
sight
of
a
human
figure
in
the
fog
that
indistinct
glimpse
was
enough
for
her
she
staggered
for
an
instant
under
the
weight
of
the
fear
which
oppressed
her
for
she
no
longer
doubted
that
she
had
been
attended
by
the
stranger
from
the
first
step
that
she
had
taken
outside
of
her
home
and
the
frantic
longing
to
escape
a
spy
gave
her
additional
strength
incapable
of
reasoning
she
quickened
her
pace
as
if
she
could
possibly
elude
a
man
who
was
surely
more
active
than
she
after
running
for
some
minutes
she
reached
a
shop
rushed
in
and
fell
rather
than
sat
down
upon
a
chair
in
front
of
the
counter
the
instant
that
she
rattled
the
latch
of
the
door
a
young
woman
who
was
engaged
in
embroidering
raised
her
eyes
recognised
through
the
glass
door
the
mantle
of
violet
silk
in
which
the
old
lady
was
wrapped
and
hastily
opened
a
drawer
as
if
to
take
out
something
which
she
intended
to
give
her
not
only
did
the
young
woman
movement
and
expression
denote
a
wish
to
be
rid
of
the
stranger
at
once
as
if
she
were
one
of
those
people
whom
one
is
not
glad
to
see
but
she
also
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
when
she
found
the
drawer
empty
then
without
glancing
at
the
lady
she
rushed
from
behind
the
counter
towards
the
and
called
her
husband
who
appeared
instantly
where
have
you
put
she
asked
him
with
a
mysterious
expression
indicating
the
old
lady
by
a
glance
and
not
finishing
her
sentence
although
the
could
see
only
the
enormous
black
silk
bonnet
surrounded
by
violet
ribbons
which
the
stranger
wore
upon
her
head
he
disappeared
after
a
glance
at
his
wife
which
seemed
to
say
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
leave
on
your
counter
amazed
by
the
old
lady
silence
and
immobility
the
walked
towards
her
and
as
she
examined
her
she
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
compassion
and
perhaps
of
curiosity
as
well
although
the
stranger
complexion
was
naturally
sallow
like
that
of
a
person
vowed
to
secret
austerities
it
was
easy
to
see
that
some
recent
emotion
had
made
her
even
paler
than
usual
her
bonnet
was
so
arranged
as
to
conceal
her
hair
which
was
presumably
whitened
by
age
for
the
neatness
of
the
collar
of
her
dress
indicated
that
she
did
not
wear
powder
that
lack
of
adornment
imparted
to
her
face
a
sort
of
religious
asceticism
her
features
were
serious
and
dignified
in
the
old
days
the
manners
and
customs
of
people
of
quality
were
so
different
from
those
of
people
belonging
to
the
lower
classes
that
one
could
easily
distinguish
a
person
of
noble
birth
so
that
the
young
woman
was
convinced
that
the
stranger
was
a
and
that
she
had
belonged
to
the
court
madame
she
said
involuntarily
and
with
respect
forgetting
that
that
title
was
proscribed
the
old
lady
did
not
reply
she
kept
her
eyes
fastened
upon
the
as
if
some
terrifying
object
were
there
apparent
what
the
matter
with
you
citizeness
asked
the
proprietor
who
reappeared
at
that
moment
the
citizen
aroused
the
lady
from
her
revery
by
handing
her
a
little
box
covered
with
blue
paper
nothing
nothing
my
friends
she
replied
in
a
mild
voice
she
looked
up
at
the
as
if
to
bestow
a
grateful
glance
upon
him
but
when
she
saw
a
red
cap
on
his
head
she
uttered
an
exclamation
ah
you
have
betrayed
me
the
young
woman
and
her
husband
replied
by
a
gesture
of
horror
which
made
the
stranger
blush
perhaps
for
having
suspected
them
perhaps
with
pleasure
excuse
me
she
said
with
childlike
gentleness
then
taking
a
louis
from
her
pocket
she
handed
it
to
the
this
is
the
price
agreed
upon
she
added
there
is
a
sort
of
poverty
which
the
poor
are
quick
to
divine
the
and
his
wife
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
the
old
lady
exchanging
the
same
thought
that
louis
was
evidently
the
last
the
lady
hands
trembled
as
she
held
out
that
coin
at
which
she
gazed
sorrowfully
but
without
avarice
but
she
seemed
to
realise
the
full
extent
of
the
sacrifice
fasting
and
poverty
were
written
upon
that
face
in
lines
as
legible
as
those
of
fear
and
ascetic
habits
there
were
vestiges
of
past
splendour
in
her
clothes
they
were
worn
silk
a
neat
though
cloak
and
lace
carefully
mended
in
a
word
the
rags
and
tatters
of
opulence
the
wavering
between
pity
and
began
by
relieving
their
consciences
in
words
but
citizeness
you
seem
very
weak
would
madame
like
something
to
refresh
herself
asked
the
woman
cutting
her
husband
short
we
have
some
very
good
soup
added
the
it
so
cold
perhaps
madame
was
chilled
by
her
walk
but
you
can
rest
here
and
warm
yourself
a
little
the
devil
is
not
as
black
as
he
is
painted
cried
the
won
by
the
kind
tone
of
the
charitable
shopkeeper
words
the
lady
admitted
that
she
had
been
followed
by
a
stranger
and
that
she
was
afraid
to
return
home
alone
is
that
all
replied
the
man
with
the
red
cap
wait
for
me
citizeness
he
gave
the
louis
to
his
wife
then
impelled
by
that
species
of
gratitude
which
finds
its
way
into
the
heart
of
a
tradesman
when
he
receives
an
extravagant
price
for
goods
of
moderate
value
he
went
to
don
his
national
guardsman
uniform
took
his
hat
thrust
his
sabre
into
his
belt
and
reappeared
under
arms
but
his
wife
had
had
time
to
reflect
and
as
in
many
other
hearts
reflection
closed
the
open
hand
of
kindliness
perturbed
in
mind
and
fearing
that
her
husband
might
become
involved
in
some
dangerous
affair
the
wife
tried
to
stop
him
by
pulling
the
skirt
of
his
coat
but
obeying
a
charitable
impulse
the
good
man
at
once
offered
to
escort
the
old
lady
it
seems
that
the
man
who
frightened
the
citizeness
is
still
prowling
about
the
shop
said
the
young
woman
nervously
i
am
afraid
so
the
lady
artlessly
replied
suppose
he
should
be
a
spy
suppose
it
was
a
conspiracy
do
go
with
her
and
take
back
the
box
these
words
whispered
in
the
ear
by
his
wife
congealed
the
impromptu
courage
which
had
moved
him
i
just
go
out
and
say
two
words
to
him
and
rid
you
of
him
in
short
order
cried
the
man
opening
the
door
and
rushing
out
the
old
lady
passive
as
a
child
and
almost
dazed
resumed
her
seat
the
worthy
tradesman
soon
reappeared
his
face
which
was
naturally
red
and
moreover
was
flushed
by
the
heat
of
his
ovens
had
suddenly
become
livid
he
was
so
terribly
frightened
that
his
legs
trembled
and
his
eyes
resembled
a
drunken
man
do
you
mean
to
have
our
heads
cut
off
you
miserable
aristocrat
he
cried
angrily
just
let
us
see
your
heels
do
ever
show
your
face
here
again
and
do
count
on
me
to
supply
you
with
materials
for
a
conspiracy
as
he
spoke
the
tried
to
take
from
the
old
lady
the
small
box
which
she
had
put
in
one
of
her
pockets
but
no
sooner
did
the
man
insolent
hands
touch
her
clothing
than
the
stranger
preferring
to
brave
the
dangers
of
the
street
with
no
other
defender
than
god
rather
than
to
lose
what
she
had
purchased
recovered
the
agility
of
her
youth
she
rushed
to
the
door
opened
it
abruptly
and
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
the
dazed
and
trembling
woman
and
her
husband
as
soon
as
the
stranger
was
out
of
doors
she
walked
rapidly
away
but
her
strength
failed
her
for
she
heard
the
snow
creak
beneath
the
heavy
step
of
the
spy
by
whom
she
was
pitilessly
followed
she
was
obliged
to
stop
and
he
stopped
she
dared
neither
speak
to
him
nor
look
at
him
whether
as
a
result
of
the
fear
which
gripped
her
heart
or
from
lack
of
intelligence
she
continued
her
way
walking
slowly
thereupon
the
man
slackened
his
pace
so
as
to
remain
at
a
distance
which
enabled
him
to
keep
his
eye
upon
her
he
seemed
to
be
the
very
shadow
of
the
old
woman
the
clock
was
striking
nine
when
the
silent
couple
again
passed
the
church
of
it
is
in
the
nature
of
all
souls
even
the
weakest
that
a
feeling
of
tranquillity
should
succeed
violent
agitation
for
although
our
feelings
are
manifold
our
bodily
powers
are
limited
and
so
the
stranger
meeting
with
no
injury
at
the
hands
of
her
supposed
persecutor
chose
to
discover
in
him
a
secret
friend
zealous
to
protect
her
she
recalled
all
the
circumstances
which
had
attended
the
unknown
appearance
as
if
to
find
plausible
arguments
in
favour
of
that
comforting
opinion
and
she
took
pleasure
in
detecting
good
rather
than
evil
intentions
in
his
behaviour
forgetting
the
terror
which
that
man
had
inspired
in
the
she
walked
with
an
assured
step
into
the
upper
parts
of
faubourg
after
half
an
hour
she
reached
a
house
near
the
junction
of
the
main
street
of
the
faubourg
and
that
which
leads
to
the
barrière
de
pantin
even
that
spot
is
one
of
the
most
solitary
in
all
paris
the
north
wind
blowing
over
the
buttes
chaumont
and
from
belleville
whistled
through
the
houses
or
rather
the
hovels
scattered
about
in
that
almost
uninhabited
valley
where
the
dividing
walls
are
built
of
earth
and
bones
that
desolate
spot
seemed
to
be
the
natural
refuge
of
poverty
and
despair
the
man
who
had
persisted
in
following
the
wretched
creature
who
was
bold
enough
to
walk
through
those
silent
streets
at
night
seemed
impressed
by
the
spectacle
presented
to
his
eyes
he
became
thoughtful
and
stood
in
evident
hesitation
in
the
dim
light
of
a
lantern
whose
feeble
rays
barely
pierced
the
mist
fear
gave
eyes
to
the
old
woman
who
fancied
that
she
could
detect
something
sinister
in
the
stranger
features
her
former
terror
reawoke
and
taking
advantage
of
the
uncertainty
which
had
checked
his
advance
to
glide
in
the
darkness
towards
the
door
of
the
solitary
house
she
pressed
a
spring
and
disappeared
with
magical
rapidity
the
stranger
motionless
as
a
statue
gazed
at
that
house
which
was
in
some
measure
the
type
of
the
wretched
dwellings
of
the
faubourg
that
unstable
hovel
built
of
rough
stones
was
covered
with
a
layer
of
yellow
plaster
so
cracked
that
it
seemed
in
danger
of
falling
before
the
slightest
gust
of
wind
the
roof
of
dark
brown
tiles
covered
with
moss
had
sunk
in
several
places
so
that
it
seemed
likely
to
give
way
under
the
weight
of
the
snow
on
each
floor
there
were
three
windows
the
sashes
of
which
rotted
by
the
dampness
and
shrunken
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
made
it
clear
that
the
cold
air
must
find
an
easy
entrance
into
the
rooms
that
isolated
house
resembled
an
old
tower
which
time
had
forgotten
to
destroy
a
faint
light
shone
through
the
irregular
windows
of
the
attic
at
the
top
of
the
structure
while
all
the
rest
of
the
house
was
in
absolute
darkness
the
old
woman
climbed
not
without
difficulty
the
steep
rough
staircase
which
was
supplied
with
a
rope
instead
of
a
baluster
she
knocked
softly
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
in
the
attic
and
dropped
hastily
upon
a
chair
which
an
old
man
offered
her
hide
hide
yourself
she
said
although
we
go
out
very
seldom
everything
that
we
do
is
known
our
footsteps
are
watched
what
is
there
new
pray
asked
another
old
woman
who
was
seated
by
the
fire
the
man
who
was
prowling
around
the
house
last
night
followed
me
at
these
words
the
three
occupants
of
the
attic
looked
at
each
other
with
indications
of
profound
terror
on
their
faces
the
old
man
was
the
least
moved
of
the
three
perhaps
because
he
was
in
the
greatest
danger
under
the
weight
of
a
great
calamity
or
under
the
yoke
of
persecution
a
courageous
man
begins
so
to
speak
by
preparing
to
sacrifice
himself
he
looks
upon
his
days
simply
as
so
many
victories
over
destiny
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
fastened
upon
this
old
man
made
it
easy
to
divine
that
he
was
the
sole
object
of
their
intense
anxiety
why
despair
of
god
my
sisters
he
said
in
a
low
but
powerful
voice
we
sang
his
praises
amid
the
cries
of
the
assassins
and
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
at
the
carmelite
convent
if
he
decreed
that
i
should
be
saved
from
that
butchery
it
was
doubtless
because
he
reserved
me
for
another
destiny
which
i
must
accept
without
a
murmur
god
protects
his
people
he
may
dispose
of
them
at
his
pleasure
it
is
of
you
not
of
me
we
must
think
no
said
one
of
the
old
women
what
are
our
lives
compared
with
that
of
a
priest
when
once
i
found
myself
outside
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
i
looked
upon
myself
as
dead
said
that
one
of
the
two
women
who
had
not
gone
out
here
replied
the
other
handing
the
priest
the
little
box
here
are
the
but
she
cried
i
hear
some
one
coming
up
the
stairs
thereupon
all
three
listened
intently
the
noise
ceased
do
not
be
alarmed
said
the
priest
if
some
one
should
try
to
enter
a
person
upon
whose
fidelity
we
can
rely
has
undoubtedly
taken
all
necessary
measures
to
cross
the
frontier
and
will
come
here
to
get
the
letters
which
i
have
written
to
the
duc
de
langeais
and
to
the
marquis
de
beauséant
asking
them
to
consider
the
means
of
rescuing
you
from
this
terrible
country
from
the
death
or
destitution
which
awaits
you
here
then
you
do
not
mean
to
go
with
us
cried
the
two
nuns
gently
with
manifestations
of
despair
my
place
is
where
there
are
victims
said
the
priest
simply
they
held
their
peace
and
gazed
at
their
companion
with
devout
admiration
sister
martha
he
said
addressing
the
nun
who
had
gone
to
buy
the
wafers
the
messenger
i
speak
of
will
reply
to
the
word
there
is
some
one
on
the
stairs
cried
the
other
nun
opening
the
door
of
a
under
the
lower
part
of
the
roof
this
time
they
could
plainly
hear
amid
the
profound
silence
the
footsteps
of
a
man
upon
the
stairs
which
were
covered
with
ridges
of
hardened
mud
the
priest
crept
with
difficulty
into
a
sort
of
cupboard
and
the
nuns
threw
over
him
a
few
pieces
of
apparel
you
may
close
the
door
sister
agatha
he
said
in
a
muffled
voice
the
priest
was
hardly
hidden
when
three
taps
on
the
door
caused
a
shock
to
the
two
holy
women
who
consulted
each
other
with
their
eyes
afraid
to
utter
a
single
word
each
of
them
seemed
to
be
about
sixty
years
old
secluded
from
the
world
for
forty
years
they
were
like
plants
habituated
to
the
air
of
a
which
wilt
if
they
are
taken
from
it
accustomed
to
the
life
of
a
convent
they
were
unable
to
imagine
any
other
life
one
morning
their
gratings
having
been
shattered
they
shuddered
to
find
themselves
free
one
can
readily
imagine
the
species
of
imbecility
which
the
events
of
the
revolution
had
produced
in
their
innocent
minds
incapable
of
reconciling
their
conventual
ideas
with
the
difficult
problems
of
life
and
not
even
understanding
their
situation
they
resembled
children
who
had
been
zealously
cared
for
hitherto
and
who
deserted
by
their
motherly
protector
prayed
instead
of
weeping
and
so
in
face
of
the
danger
which
they
apprehended
at
that
moment
they
remained
mute
and
passive
having
no
conception
of
any
other
defence
than
christian
resignation
the
man
who
desired
to
enter
interpreted
that
silence
to
suit
himself
he
opened
the
door
and
appeared
abruptly
before
them
the
two
nuns
shuddered
as
they
recognised
the
man
who
had
been
prowling
about
their
house
making
inquiries
about
them
for
some
time
they
did
not
move
but
gazed
at
him
with
anxious
curiosity
after
the
manner
of
the
children
of
savage
tribes
who
examine
strangers
in
silence
he
was
tall
and
stout
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
or
appearance
to
indicate
an
man
he
imitated
the
immobility
of
the
nuns
and
moved
his
eyes
slowly
about
the
room
in
which
he
stood
two
straw
mats
laid
upon
boards
served
the
two
nuns
as
beds
there
was
a
single
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
upon
it
a
copper
candlestick
a
few
plates
three
knives
and
a
round
loaf
the
fire
on
the
hearth
was
very
low
and
a
few
sticks
of
wood
piled
in
a
corner
testified
to
the
poverty
of
the
two
occupants
the
walls
covered
with
an
ancient
layer
of
paint
demonstrated
the
wretched
condition
of
the
roof
for
stains
like
brown
threads
marked
the
intrusion
of
the
a
relic
rescued
doubtless
during
the
pillage
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
adorned
the
mantel
three
chairs
two
chests
and
a
wretched
commode
completed
the
furniture
of
the
room
a
door
beside
the
chimney
indicated
the
existence
of
an
inner
chamber
the
inventory
of
the
cell
was
speedily
made
by
the
person
who
had
thrust
himself
into
the
bosom
of
that
group
under
such
alarming
auspices
a
sentiment
of
compassion
was
expressed
upon
his
face
and
he
cast
a
kindly
glance
upon
the
two
women
but
seemed
at
least
as
embarrassed
as
they
the
strange
silence
preserved
by
all
three
lasted
but
a
short
time
for
the
stranger
at
last
divined
the
mental
weakness
and
the
inexperience
of
the
two
poor
creatures
and
he
said
to
them
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
soften
i
do
not
come
here
as
an
enemy
citizenesses
he
paused
and
then
resumed
my
sisters
if
any
misfortune
should
happen
to
you
be
sure
that
i
have
had
no
part
in
it
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
they
still
remained
silent
if
i
annoy
you
if
i
embarrass
you
tell
me
so
frankly
and
i
will
go
but
understand
that
i
am
entirely
devoted
to
you
that
if
there
is
any
service
that
i
can
do
you
you
may
employ
me
without
fear
that
i
alone
perhaps
am
above
the
law
as
there
is
no
longer
a
king
there
was
such
a
ring
of
truth
in
these
words
that
sister
agatha
the
one
of
the
two
nuns
who
belonged
to
the
family
of
langeais
and
whose
manners
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
had
formerly
been
familiar
with
magnificent
festivities
and
had
breathed
the
air
of
courts
instantly
pointed
to
one
of
the
chairs
as
if
to
request
their
guest
to
be
seated
the
stranger
manifested
a
sort
of
mixture
of
pleasure
and
melancholy
when
he
saw
that
gesture
and
he
waited
until
the
two
venerable
women
were
seated
before
seating
himself
you
have
given
shelter
he
continued
to
a
venerable
unsworn
priest
who
miraculously
escaped
the
massacre
at
the
carmelite
convent
hosanna
said
sister
agatha
interrupting
the
stranger
and
gazing
at
him
with
anxious
interest
i
do
think
that
that
is
his
name
he
replied
but
monsieur
said
sister
martha
hastily
we
have
any
priest
here
and
in
that
case
you
must
be
more
careful
and
more
prudent
retorted
the
stranger
gently
reaching
to
the
table
and
taking
up
a
breviary
i
do
not
believe
that
you
know
latin
and
he
did
not
continue
for
the
extraordinary
emotion
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
unhappy
nuns
made
him
feel
that
he
had
gone
too
far
they
were
trembling
and
their
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
do
not
be
alarmed
he
said
to
them
cheerily
i
know
the
name
of
your
guest
and
your
names
and
three
days
ago
i
was
informed
of
your
destitution
and
of
your
devotion
to
the
venerable
abbé
of
hush
said
sister
agatha
innocently
putting
her
finger
to
her
lips
you
see
my
sisters
that
if
i
had
formed
the
detestable
plan
of
betraying
you
i
might
already
have
done
it
more
than
once
when
he
heard
these
words
the
priest
emerged
from
his
prison
and
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
can
not
believe
monsieur
he
said
to
the
stranger
that
you
are
one
of
our
persecutors
and
i
trust
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
the
priest
saintlike
confidence
the
nobility
of
soul
that
shone
in
all
his
features
would
have
disarmed
an
assassin
the
mysterious
personage
who
had
enlivened
that
scene
of
destitution
and
resignation
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
group
formed
by
those
three
then
he
assumed
a
confidential
tone
and
addressed
the
priest
in
these
words
father
i
have
come
to
implore
you
to
celebrate
a
mortuary
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
a
a
consecrated
person
whose
body
however
will
never
lie
in
holy
ground
the
priest
involuntarily
shuddered
the
two
nuns
not
understanding
as
yet
to
whom
the
stranger
referred
stood
with
necks
outstretched
and
faces
turned
towards
the
two
men
in
an
attitude
of
intense
curiosity
the
priest
scrutinised
the
stranger
unfeigned
anxiety
was
depicted
upon
his
face
and
his
eyes
expressed
the
most
ardent
entreaty
very
well
replied
the
priest
at
midnight
return
here
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
celebrate
the
only
funeral
service
which
we
can
offer
in
expiation
of
the
crime
to
which
you
refer
the
stranger
started
but
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
at
once
grateful
and
solemn
seemed
to
triumph
over
some
secret
grief
having
respectfully
saluted
the
priest
and
the
two
holy
women
he
disappeared
manifesting
a
sort
of
mute
gratitude
which
was
understood
by
those
three
noble
hearts
about
two
hours
after
this
scene
the
stranger
returned
knocked
softly
at
the
attic
door
and
was
admitted
by
mademoiselle
de
beauséant
who
escorted
him
into
the
second
room
of
that
humble
lodging
where
everything
had
been
prepared
for
the
ceremony
between
two
flues
of
the
chimney
the
nuns
had
placed
the
old
commode
whose
antiquated
shape
was
covered
by
a
magnificent
of
green
silk
a
large
crucifix
of
ebony
and
ivory
fastened
upon
the
discoloured
wall
heightened
the
effect
of
its
bareness
and
inevitably
attracted
the
eye
four
slender
little
tapers
which
the
sisters
had
succeeded
in
standing
upon
that
improvised
altar
by
fixing
them
in
cast
a
pale
light
which
the
wall
reflected
dimly
that
faint
gleam
barely
lighted
the
rest
of
the
room
but
in
that
it
confined
its
illumination
to
the
consecrated
objects
it
resembled
a
ray
of
light
from
heaven
upon
that
undecorated
altar
the
floor
was
damp
the
attic
roof
which
sloped
sharply
on
both
sides
had
various
cracks
through
which
a
biting
wind
blew
nothing
less
stately
could
be
imagined
and
yet
perhaps
there
could
be
nothing
more
solemn
than
this
lugubrious
ceremony
a
silence
so
profound
that
it
would
have
enabled
them
to
hear
the
faintest
sound
on
distant
thoroughfares
diffused
a
sort
of
sombre
majesty
over
that
nocturnal
scene
in
short
the
grandeur
of
the
occasion
contrasted
so
strikingly
with
the
poverty
of
the
surroundings
that
the
result
was
a
sensation
of
religious
awe
the
two
old
nuns
kneeling
on
the
damp
floor
on
either
side
of
the
altar
heedless
of
the
deadly
moisture
prayed
in
unison
with
the
priest
who
clad
in
his
pontifical
vestments
prepared
a
golden
chalice
adorned
with
precious
stones
a
consecrated
vessel
rescued
doubtless
from
the
plunderers
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
beside
that
pyx
an
object
of
regal
magnificence
were
the
water
and
wine
destined
for
the
sacrament
in
two
glasses
hardly
worthy
of
the
lowest
tavern
in
default
of
a
missal
the
priest
had
placed
his
breviary
on
a
corner
of
the
altar
a
common
plate
was
provided
for
the
washing
of
those
innocent
hands
pure
of
bloodshed
all
was
majestic
and
yet
paltry
poor
but
noble
profane
and
holy
in
one
the
stranger
knelt
piously
between
the
two
nuns
but
suddenly
when
he
noticed
a
band
of
crape
on
the
chalice
and
on
the
crucifix
for
having
nothing
to
indicate
the
purpose
of
that
mortuary
mass
the
priest
had
draped
god
himself
in
mourning
he
was
assailed
by
such
an
overpowering
memory
that
drops
of
sweat
gathered
upon
his
broad
forehead
the
four
silent
actors
in
that
scene
gazed
at
each
other
mysteriously
then
their
hearts
acting
upon
one
another
communicated
their
sentiments
to
each
other
and
became
blended
into
the
one
emotion
of
religious
pity
it
was
as
if
their
thoughts
had
evoked
the
royal
martyr
whose
remains
had
been
consumed
by
quicklime
but
whose
shade
stood
before
them
in
all
its
royal
majesty
they
celebrated
an
without
the
body
of
the
deceased
beneath
those
disjointed
tiles
and
laths
four
christians
interceded
with
god
for
a
king
of
france
and
performed
his
obsequies
without
a
bier
it
was
the
purest
of
all
possible
devotions
an
amazing
act
of
fidelity
performed
without
one
thought
of
self
doubtless
in
the
eyes
of
god
it
was
like
the
glass
of
water
which
is
equal
to
the
greatest
virtues
the
whole
of
monarchy
was
there
in
the
prayers
of
a
priest
and
of
two
poor
nuns
but
perhaps
the
revolution
too
was
represented
by
that
man
whose
face
betrayed
too
much
remorse
not
to
cause
a
belief
that
he
was
acting
in
obedience
to
an
impulse
of
unbounded
repentance
instead
of
saying
the
latin
words
ad
altare
the
priest
obeying
a
divine
inspiration
looked
at
the
three
persons
who
represented
christian
france
and
said
to
them
in
words
which
effaced
the
poverty
of
that
wretched
place
we
are
about
to
enter
into
god
sanctuary
at
these
words
uttered
with
most
impressive
unction
a
thrill
of
holy
awe
seized
the
stranger
and
the
two
nuns
not
beneath
the
arches
of
peter
at
rome
could
god
have
appeared
with
more
majesty
than
he
then
appeared
in
that
abode
of
poverty
before
the
eyes
of
those
christians
so
true
it
is
that
between
man
and
him
every
intermediary
seems
useless
and
that
he
derives
his
grandeur
from
himself
alone
the
stranger
fervour
was
genuine
so
that
the
sentiment
which
joined
the
prayers
of
those
four
servants
of
god
and
the
king
was
unanimous
the
sacred
words
rang
out
like
celestial
music
amid
the
silence
there
was
a
moment
when
tears
choked
the
stranger
voice
it
was
during
the
paternoster
the
priest
added
to
it
this
latin
prayer
which
the
stranger
evidently
understood
remitte
scelus
regicidis
sicut
ludovicus
eis
remisit
semetipse
and
forgive
the
regicides
even
as
louis
xvi
himself
forgave
them
the
two
nuns
saw
two
great
tears
leave
a
moist
trace
on
the
manly
cheeks
of
the
stranger
and
fall
to
the
floor
the
office
of
the
dead
was
recited
the
salvum
fac
chanted
in
a
low
voice
touched
the
hearts
of
those
faithful
royalists
who
reflected
that
the
infant
king
for
whom
they
were
praying
to
the
most
high
at
that
moment
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
stranger
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
there
might
still
be
committed
a
new
crime
in
which
he
would
doubtless
be
compelled
to
take
part
when
the
service
was
at
an
end
the
priest
motioned
to
the
two
nuns
to
withdraw
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
the
stranger
he
walked
towards
him
with
a
mild
and
melancholy
expression
and
said
to
him
in
a
fatherly
tone
my
son
if
you
have
dipped
your
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
martyr
king
confess
to
me
there
is
no
sin
which
in
god
eyes
may
not
be
effaced
by
repentance
so
touching
and
so
sincere
as
yours
seems
to
be
at
the
first
words
of
the
priest
the
stranger
made
an
involuntary
gesture
of
terror
but
his
face
resumed
its
tranquillity
and
he
met
the
astonished
priest
eye
with
calm
assurance
father
he
said
to
him
in
a
perceptibly
tremulous
voice
no
one
is
more
innocent
than
i
of
bloodshed
i
am
bound
to
believe
you
said
the
priest
there
was
a
pause
during
which
he
examined
the
penitent
more
closely
then
persisting
in
taking
him
for
one
of
those
timid
members
of
the
convention
who
sacrificed
a
consecrated
and
inviolate
head
in
order
to
preserve
their
own
he
continued
in
a
solemn
voice
remember
my
son
that
to
be
absolved
from
that
great
crime
it
is
not
enough
not
to
have
actually
taken
part
in
it
those
who
when
they
might
have
defended
their
king
left
their
swords
in
the
scabbard
will
have
a
very
heavy
account
to
settle
with
the
king
of
heaven
ah
yes
added
the
old
priest
shaking
his
head
with
a
most
expressive
movement
yes
very
heavy
for
by
remaining
idle
they
became
the
involuntary
accomplices
of
that
ghastly
crime
do
you
think
inquired
the
thunderstruck
stranger
that
indirect
participation
will
be
punished
is
the
soldier
guilty
who
is
ordered
to
join
the
the
priest
hesitated
pleased
with
the
dilemma
in
which
he
had
placed
that
puritan
of
royalty
by
planting
him
between
the
dogma
of
passive
obedience
which
according
to
the
partisans
of
monarchy
should
be
predominant
in
all
military
codes
and
the
no
less
important
dogma
which
sanctifies
the
respect
due
to
the
person
of
kings
the
stranger
was
too
quick
to
see
in
the
priest
hesitation
a
favourable
solution
of
the
doubts
by
which
he
seemed
to
be
perturbed
then
in
order
to
give
the
venerable
jansenist
no
longer
time
to
reflect
he
said
to
him
i
should
blush
to
offer
you
any
sort
of
compensation
for
the
funeral
service
which
you
have
just
performed
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
and
for
the
relief
of
my
conscience
a
thing
of
inestimable
value
can
be
paid
for
only
by
an
offering
which
is
beyond
all
price
deign
therefore
to
accept
monsieur
the
gift
that
i
offer
you
of
a
blessed
relic
the
day
will
come
perhaps
when
you
will
realise
its
value
as
he
said
this
the
stranger
handed
the
ecclesiastic
a
small
box
of
light
weight
the
priest
took
it
involuntarily
so
to
speak
for
the
solemnity
of
the
man
words
the
tone
in
which
he
said
them
and
the
respect
with
which
he
handled
the
box
had
surprised
him
beyond
measure
they
returned
then
to
the
room
where
the
two
nuns
were
awaiting
them
you
are
said
the
stranger
in
a
house
whose
owner
mucius
scævola
the
plasterer
who
lives
on
the
first
floor
is
famous
throughout
the
section
for
his
patriotism
but
he
is
secretly
attached
to
the
bourbons
he
used
to
be
a
huntsman
in
the
service
of
monseigneur
le
prince
de
conti
and
he
owes
his
fortune
to
him
if
you
do
not
go
out
of
his
house
you
are
safer
than
in
any
place
in
france
stay
here
devout
hearts
will
attend
to
your
necessities
and
you
may
await
without
danger
less
evil
times
a
year
hence
on
the
of
january
as
he
mentioned
the
date
he
could
not
restrain
an
involuntary
gesture
if
you
continue
to
occupy
this
dismal
apartment
i
will
return
to
celebrate
again
a
mass
of
expiation
he
said
no
more
he
bowed
to
the
silent
occupants
of
the
attic
cast
a
last
glance
upon
the
evidences
of
their
poverty
and
went
away
to
the
two
innocent
nuns
such
an
adventure
had
all
the
interest
of
a
romance
and
so
as
soon
as
the
venerable
abbé
informed
them
of
the
mysterious
gift
so
solemnly
bestowed
upon
him
by
that
man
the
box
was
placed
upon
the
table
and
the
three
anxious
faces
dimly
lighted
by
the
candle
betrayed
an
indescribable
curiosity
mademoiselle
de
langeais
opened
the
box
and
found
therein
a
handkerchief
of
finest
linen
drenched
with
perspiration
and
on
unfolding
it
they
saw
stains
it
is
blood
said
the
priest
it
is
marked
with
the
royal
crown
cried
the
other
nun
the
two
sisters
dropped
the
precious
relic
with
a
gesture
of
horror
to
those
two
ingenuous
souls
the
mystery
in
which
the
stranger
was
enveloped
became
altogether
inexplicable
and
as
for
the
priest
from
that
day
he
did
not
even
seek
an
explanation
of
it
the
three
prisoners
soon
perceived
that
a
powerful
arm
was
stretched
over
them
in
spite
of
the
terror
in
the
first
place
they
received
a
supply
of
wood
and
provisions
then
the
two
nuns
realised
that
a
woman
must
be
associated
with
their
protector
when
some
one
sent
them
linen
and
clothing
which
enabled
them
to
go
out
without
being
noticed
by
reason
of
the
aristocratic
cut
of
the
garments
which
they
had
been
forced
to
retain
and
lastly
mucius
scævola
gave
them
two
cards
of
citizenship
it
often
happened
that
information
essential
to
the
priest
safety
reached
him
by
devious
ways
and
he
found
this
advice
so
opportune
that
it
could
have
been
given
only
by
somebody
initiated
in
state
secrets
despite
the
famine
which
prevailed
in
paris
the
outcasts
found
at
the
door
of
their
lodging
rations
of
white
bread
which
was
brought
there
regularly
by
invisible
hands
they
believed
however
that
they
could
identify
mucius
scævola
as
the
mysterious
agent
of
this
beneficence
which
was
always
as
ingenious
as
it
was
timely
the
noble
occupants
of
the
attic
could
not
doubt
that
their
protector
was
the
person
who
had
come
to
ask
the
priest
to
celebrate
the
mortuary
mass
on
the
evening
of
the
of
january
so
that
he
became
the
object
of
a
peculiar
sort
of
worship
to
those
three
beings
who
had
no
hope
except
in
him
and
lived
only
through
him
they
had
added
special
prayers
for
him
to
their
daily
devotions
night
and
morning
those
pious
souls
offered
up
entreaties
for
his
happiness
for
his
prosperity
for
his
salvation
and
prayed
to
god
to
rescue
him
from
all
snares
to
deliver
him
from
his
enemies
and
to
grant
him
a
long
and
peaceful
life
their
gratitude
being
renewed
every
day
so
to
speak
was
necessarily
accompanied
by
a
feeling
of
curiosity
which
became
more
intense
from
day
to
day
the
circumstances
which
had
attended
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
were
the
subject
of
their
conversation
they
formed
innumerable
conjectures
about
him
and
the
diversion
which
their
preoccupation
with
him
afforded
them
was
a
benefaction
of
a
new
sort
they
were
fully
determined
not
to
allow
the
stranger
to
evade
their
friendship
when
he
should
return
according
to
his
promise
to
commemorate
the
sad
anniversary
of
the
death
of
louis
xvi
that
night
so
impatiently
awaited
came
at
last
at
midnight
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
stranger
heavy
steps
on
the
old
wooden
staircase
the
room
had
been
arrayed
to
receive
him
the
altar
was
in
place
this
time
the
sisters
opened
the
door
beforehand
and
went
forth
eagerly
to
light
the
staircase
mademoiselle
de
langeais
even
went
down
a
few
steps
in
order
to
see
her
benefactor
the
sooner
come
she
said
to
him
in
a
tremulous
and
affectionate
voice
come
we
are
waiting
for
you
the
man
raised
his
head
cast
a
gloomy
glance
upon
the
nun
and
made
no
reply
she
felt
as
if
a
garment
of
ice
had
fallen
upon
her
and
she
said
no
more
at
sight
of
him
gratitude
and
curiosity
expired
in
all
their
hearts
he
may
have
been
less
cold
less
silent
less
than
he
appeared
to
those
poor
souls
whom
the
exaltation
of
their
feeling
inclined
to
an
outpouring
of
friendliness
the
three
unhappy
prisoners
understanding
that
he
proposed
to
remain
a
stranger
to
them
resigned
themselves
to
it
the
priest
fancied
that
he
detected
upon
the
stranger
lips
a
smile
that
was
instantly
repressed
when
he
saw
the
preparations
that
had
been
made
to
receive
him
he
heard
the
mass
and
prayed
but
he
disappeared
after
responding
by
a
few
words
of
negative
courtesy
to
mademoiselle
de
langeais
invitation
to
share
the
little
supper
they
had
prepared
after
the
ninth
of
thermidor
the
nuns
were
able
to
go
about
paris
without
danger
the
old
priest
first
errand
was
to
a
perfumer
shop
at
the
sign
of
reine
des
kept
by
citizen
and
citizeness
ragon
formerly
perfumers
to
the
court
who
had
remained
true
to
the
royal
family
and
of
whose
services
the
vendeans
availed
themselves
to
correspond
with
the
princes
and
the
royalist
committee
in
paris
the
abbé
dressed
according
to
the
style
of
the
period
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
of
that
shop
between
and
rue
des
frondeurs
when
a
crowd
which
filled
rue
prevented
him
from
going
out
what
is
it
he
asked
madame
ragon
oh
it
nothing
she
replied
just
the
tumbril
and
the
executioner
going
to
the
place
louis
xv
ah
we
saw
him
very
often
last
year
but
four
days
after
the
anniversary
of
the
of
january
we
can
look
at
that
horrible
procession
without
distress
why
so
said
the
abbé
what
you
say
is
not
christian
why
it
the
execution
of
robespierre
accomplices
they
defended
themselves
as
long
as
they
could
but
they
going
now
themselves
where
they
have
sent
so
many
innocent
people
the
crowd
passed
like
a
flood
abbé
de
marolles
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
curiosity
saw
over
the
sea
of
heads
standing
on
the
tumbril
the
man
who
three
days
before
had
listened
to
his
mass
who
is
that
he
said
that
man
who
that
is
the
headsman
replied
monsieur
ragon
giving
the
executioner
his
monarchical
name
my
dear
my
dear
cried
madame
ragon
monsieur
is
fainting
and
the
old
woman
seized
a
phial
of
salts
in
order
to
bring
the
old
priest
to
himself
doubtless
said
the
old
priest
he
gave
me
the
handkerchief
with
which
the
king
wiped
his
brow
when
he
went
to
his
martyrdom
poor
man
that
steel
knife
had
a
heart
when
all
france
had
none
the
perfumers
thought
that
the
unfortunate
priest
was
delirious
la
grande
bretèche
about
one
hundred
yards
from
vendôme
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
there
stands
an
old
house
surmounted
by
a
very
high
roof
and
so
completely
isolated
that
there
is
not
in
the
neighbourhood
a
single
tannery
or
wretched
inn
such
as
we
see
in
the
outskirts
of
almost
every
small
town
in
front
of
the
house
is
a
small
garden
bordering
the
river
in
which
the
boxwood
borders
of
the
paths
once
neatly
trimmed
now
grow
at
their
pleasure
a
few
willows
born
in
the
loire
have
grown
as
rapidly
as
the
hedge
which
encloses
the
garden
and
half
conceal
the
house
the
plants
which
we
call
weeds
adorn
the
slope
of
the
bank
with
their
luxuriant
vegetation
the
neglected
for
ten
years
bear
no
fruit
their
offshoots
form
a
dense
undergrowth
the
espaliers
resemble
hornbeam
hedges
the
paths
formerly
gravelled
are
overrun
with
purslane
but
to
tell
the
truth
there
are
no
paths
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
upon
which
hang
the
ruins
of
the
old
château
of
the
dukes
of
vendôme
the
only
spot
from
which
the
eye
can
look
into
this
enclosure
you
would
say
to
yourself
that
at
a
period
which
it
is
difficult
to
determine
that
little
nook
was
the
delight
of
some
gentleman
devoted
to
roses
and
tulips
to
horticulture
in
short
but
especially
fond
of
fine
fruit
you
espy
an
arbour
or
rather
the
ruins
of
an
arbour
beneath
which
a
table
still
stands
not
yet
entirely
consumed
by
time
at
sight
of
that
garden
which
is
no
longer
a
garden
one
may
divine
the
negative
delights
of
the
peaceful
life
which
provincials
lead
as
one
divines
the
existence
of
a
worthy
tradesman
by
reading
the
epitaph
on
his
tombstone
to
round
out
the
melancholy
yet
soothing
thoughts
which
fill
the
mind
there
is
on
one
of
the
walls
a
embellished
with
this
commonplace
christian
inscription
ultimam
cogita
the
roof
of
the
house
is
terribly
dilapidated
the
blinds
are
always
drawn
the
balconies
are
covered
with
the
doors
are
never
opened
tall
weeds
mark
with
green
lines
the
cracks
in
the
steps
the
ironwork
is
covered
with
rust
moon
sun
winter
summer
snow
have
rotted
the
wood
warped
the
boards
and
corroded
the
paint
the
deathly
silence
which
reigns
there
is
disturbed
only
by
the
birds
the
cats
the
martens
the
rats
and
the
mice
which
are
at
liberty
to
run
about
to
fight
and
to
eat
one
another
at
their
will
an
invisible
hand
has
written
everywhere
the
word
mystery
if
impelled
by
curiosity
you
should
go
to
inspect
the
house
on
the
street
side
you
would
see
a
high
gate
arched
at
the
top
in
which
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
have
made
numberless
holes
i
learned
later
that
that
gate
had
been
condemned
ten
years
before
through
these
irregular
breaches
you
would
be
able
to
observe
the
perfect
harmony
between
the
garden
front
and
the
courtyard
front
the
same
disorder
reigns
supreme
in
both
tufts
of
weeds
surround
the
pavements
enormous
cracks
furrow
the
walls
whose
blackened
tops
are
enlaced
by
the
countless
tendrils
of
climbing
plants
the
steps
are
wrenched
apart
the
is
rotten
the
gutters
are
broken
what
fire
from
heaven
has
passed
this
way
what
tribunal
has
ordered
salt
to
be
strewn
upon
this
dwelling
has
god
been
insulted
here
has
france
been
betrayed
such
are
the
questions
which
one
asks
one
self
the
reptiles
crawl
hither
and
thither
without
answering
that
empty
and
deserted
house
is
an
immense
riddle
the
solution
of
which
is
known
to
no
one
it
was
formerly
a
small
feudal
estate
and
bore
the
name
of
la
grande
bretèche
during
my
stay
at
vendôme
where
desplein
had
left
me
to
attend
a
rich
patient
the
aspect
of
that
strange
building
became
one
of
my
keenest
pleasures
was
it
not
more
than
a
mere
ruin
some
souvenirs
of
undeniable
authenticity
are
always
connected
with
a
ruin
but
that
abode
still
standing
although
in
process
of
gradual
demolition
by
an
avenging
hand
concealed
a
secret
an
unknown
thought
at
the
very
least
it
betrayed
a
caprice
more
than
once
in
the
evening
i
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
hedge
now
wild
and
uncared
for
which
surrounded
that
enclosure
i
defied
scratches
and
made
my
way
into
that
ownerless
garden
that
estate
which
was
neither
public
nor
private
and
i
remained
whole
hours
there
contemplating
its
disarray
not
even
to
learn
the
story
which
would
doubtless
account
for
that
extraordinary
spectacle
would
i
have
asked
a
single
question
of
any
vendômese
gossip
straying
about
there
i
composed
delightful
romances
i
abandoned
myself
to
little
orgies
of
melancholy
which
enchanted
me
if
i
had
learned
the
cause
of
that
perhaps
most
commonplace
neglect
i
should
have
lost
the
unspoken
poesy
with
which
i
intoxicated
myself
to
me
that
spot
represented
the
most
diverse
images
of
human
life
darkened
by
its
misfortunes
now
it
was
the
air
of
the
cloister
minus
the
monks
again
the
perfect
peace
of
the
cemetery
minus
the
dead
speaking
their
epitaphic
language
the
house
of
the
leper
that
of
the
fates
but
it
was
above
all
the
image
of
the
province
with
its
meditation
with
its
life
i
have
often
wept
there
but
never
laughed
more
than
once
i
have
felt
an
involuntary
terror
as
i
heard
above
my
head
the
low
rustling
made
by
the
wings
of
some
hurrying
dove
the
ground
is
damp
you
must
beware
of
lizards
snakes
and
toads
which
wander
about
there
with
the
fearless
liberty
of
nature
above
all
you
must
not
fear
the
cold
for
after
a
few
seconds
you
feel
an
icy
cloak
resting
upon
your
shoulders
like
the
hand
of
the
commendator
on
the
neck
of
don
juan
one
evening
i
had
shuddered
there
the
wind
had
twisted
an
old
rusty
weathervane
whose
shrieks
resembled
a
groan
uttered
by
the
house
at
the
moment
that
i
was
finishing
a
rather
dismal
melodrama
by
which
i
sought
to
explain
to
myself
that
species
of
monumental
grief
i
returned
to
my
inn
beset
by
sombre
thoughts
when
i
had
supped
my
hostess
entered
my
room
with
a
mysterious
air
and
said
to
me
here
is
monsieur
regnault
monsieur
who
is
monsieur
regnault
what
monsieur
does
know
monsieur
regnault
that
funny
she
said
as
she
left
the
room
suddenly
i
saw
a
tall
slender
man
dressed
in
black
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
who
entered
the
room
like
a
ram
ready
to
rush
at
his
rival
disclosing
a
retreating
forehead
a
small
pointed
head
and
a
pale
face
not
unlike
a
glass
of
dirty
water
you
would
have
said
that
he
was
the
doorkeeper
of
some
minister
he
wore
an
old
coat
threadbare
at
the
seams
but
he
had
a
diamond
in
his
and
gold
rings
in
his
ears
to
whom
have
i
the
honour
of
speaking
monsieur
i
asked
him
he
took
a
chair
seated
himself
in
front
of
my
fire
placed
his
hat
on
my
table
and
replied
rubbing
his
hands
ah
it
very
cold
i
am
monsieur
regnault
monsieur
i
bowed
saying
to
myself
bondocani
look
for
him
i
am
the
notary
at
vendôme
he
continued
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
monsieur
i
exclaimed
but
i
am
not
ready
to
make
my
will
for
reasons
best
known
to
myself
just
a
minute
he
rejoined
raising
his
hand
as
if
to
impose
silence
upon
me
i
beg
pardon
monsieur
i
beg
pardon
i
have
heard
that
you
go
to
walk
sometimes
in
the
garden
of
la
grande
bretèche
yes
monsieur
just
a
minute
he
said
repeating
his
gesture
that
practice
constitutes
a
downright
trespass
i
have
come
monsieur
in
the
name
and
as
executor
of
the
late
madame
countess
de
merret
to
beg
you
to
discontinue
your
visits
just
a
minute
i
not
a
turk
and
i
propose
to
charge
you
with
a
crime
besides
it
may
well
be
that
you
are
not
aware
of
the
circumstances
which
compel
me
to
allow
the
finest
mansion
in
vendôme
to
fall
to
ruin
however
monsieur
you
seem
to
be
a
man
of
education
and
you
must
know
that
the
law
forbids
entrance
upon
an
enclosed
estate
under
severe
penalties
a
hedge
is
as
good
as
a
wall
but
the
present
condition
of
the
house
may
serve
as
an
excuse
for
your
curiosity
i
would
ask
nothing
better
than
to
allow
you
to
go
and
come
as
you
please
in
that
house
but
as
it
is
my
duty
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
testatrix
i
have
the
honour
monsieur
to
request
you
not
to
go
into
that
garden
again
even
i
myself
monsieur
since
the
opening
of
the
will
have
never
set
foot
inside
that
house
which
as
i
have
had
the
honour
to
tell
you
is
a
part
of
the
estate
of
madame
de
merret
we
simply
reported
the
number
of
doors
and
windows
in
order
to
fix
the
amount
of
the
impost
which
i
pay
annually
from
the
fund
set
aside
for
that
purpose
by
the
late
countess
ah
her
will
made
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
vendôme
monsieur
at
that
he
stopped
to
blow
his
nose
the
excellent
man
i
respected
his
loquacity
understanding
perfectly
that
the
administration
of
madame
de
merret
property
was
the
important
event
of
his
life
his
reputation
his
glory
his
restoration
i
must
needs
bid
adieu
to
my
pleasant
reveries
to
my
romances
so
that
i
was
not
inclined
to
scorn
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
truth
from
an
official
source
would
it
be
indiscreet
monsieur
i
asked
him
to
ask
you
the
reason
of
this
extraordinary
state
of
affairs
at
that
question
an
expression
which
betrayed
all
the
pleasure
that
a
man
feels
who
is
accustomed
to
ride
a
hobby
passed
over
the
face
he
pulled
up
his
shirt
collar
with
a
air
produced
his
opened
it
offered
it
to
me
and
at
my
refusal
took
a
famous
pinch
himself
he
was
happy
the
man
who
has
no
hobby
has
no
idea
of
the
satisfaction
that
can
be
derived
from
life
a
hobby
is
the
precise
mean
between
passion
and
monomania
at
that
moment
i
understood
the
witty
expression
of
sterne
in
all
its
extent
and
i
had
a
perfect
conception
of
the
joy
with
which
uncle
toby
with
trim
assistance
bestrode
his
monsieur
said
monsieur
regnault
i
was
chief
clerk
to
master
roguin
of
paris
an
excellent
office
of
which
you
may
have
heard
no
why
it
was
made
famous
by
a
disastrous
failure
not
having
sufficient
money
to
practise
in
paris
at
the
price
to
which
offices
had
risen
in
i
came
here
and
bought
the
office
of
my
predecessor
i
had
relatives
in
vendôme
among
others
a
very
rich
aunt
who
gave
me
her
daughter
in
marriage
monsieur
he
continued
after
a
brief
pause
three
months
after
being
licensed
by
the
keeper
of
the
seals
i
was
sent
for
one
evening
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
i
was
not
then
married
by
madame
countess
de
merret
to
come
to
her
château
de
merret
her
maid
an
excellent
girl
who
works
in
this
inn
was
at
my
door
with
madame
countess
carriage
but
just
a
minute
i
must
tell
you
monsieur
that
monsieur
count
de
merret
had
gone
to
paris
to
die
two
months
before
i
came
here
he
died
miserably
there
abandoning
himself
to
excesses
of
all
sorts
you
understand
on
the
day
of
his
departure
madame
countess
had
left
la
grande
bretèche
and
had
dismantled
it
indeed
some
people
declare
that
she
burned
the
furniture
and
hangings
and
all
chattels
whatsoever
now
contained
in
the
estate
leased
by
the
said
what
on
earth
am
i
saying
i
beg
pardon
i
thought
i
was
dictating
a
that
she
burned
them
he
continued
in
the
fields
at
merret
have
you
been
to
merret
monsieur
no
he
said
answering
his
own
question
ah
that
is
a
lovely
spot
for
about
three
months
he
continued
after
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
monsieur
count
and
madame
countess
led
a
strange
life
they
received
no
guests
madame
lived
on
the
ground
floor
and
monsieur
on
the
first
floor
when
madame
countess
was
left
alone
she
never
appeared
except
at
church
later
in
her
own
house
at
her
château
she
refused
to
see
the
friends
who
came
to
see
her
she
was
already
much
changed
when
she
left
la
grande
bretèche
to
go
to
merret
the
dear
woman
i
say
because
this
diamond
came
from
her
but
i
actually
only
saw
her
once
the
excellent
lady
then
was
very
ill
she
had
doubtless
despaired
of
her
health
for
she
died
without
calling
a
doctor
so
that
many
of
our
ladies
thought
that
she
was
not
in
full
possession
of
her
wits
my
curiosity
was
therefore
strangely
aroused
monsieur
when
i
learned
that
madame
de
merret
needed
my
services
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
took
an
interest
in
that
story
that
same
evening
although
it
was
late
the
whole
town
knew
that
i
had
gone
to
merret
the
maid
answered
rather
vaguely
the
questions
that
i
asked
her
on
the
road
she
told
me
however
that
her
mistress
had
received
the
sacrament
from
the
curé
of
merret
during
the
day
and
that
she
did
not
seem
likely
to
live
through
the
night
i
reached
the
château
about
eleven
i
mounted
the
main
staircase
after
passing
through
divers
large
rooms
high
and
dark
and
as
cold
and
damp
as
the
devil
i
reached
the
state
bedchamber
where
the
countess
was
according
to
the
reports
that
were
current
concerning
that
lady
i
should
never
end
monsieur
if
i
should
repeat
all
the
stories
that
are
told
about
her
i
had
thought
of
her
as
a
coquette
but
if
you
please
i
had
much
difficulty
in
finding
her
in
the
huge
bed
in
which
she
lay
to
be
sure
to
light
that
enormous
wainscoted
chamber
of
the
old
where
everything
was
so
covered
with
dust
that
it
made
one
sneeze
simply
to
look
at
it
she
had
only
one
of
those
argand
lamps
ah
but
you
have
never
been
to
merret
well
monsieur
the
bed
is
one
of
those
beds
of
the
olden
time
with
a
high
canopy
of
flowered
material
a
small
stood
beside
the
bed
and
i
saw
upon
it
a
copy
of
the
of
jesus
which
by
the
by
i
bought
for
my
wife
as
well
as
the
lamp
there
was
also
a
large
couch
for
the
attendant
and
two
chairs
not
a
spark
of
fire
that
was
all
the
furniture
it
would
have
filled
ten
lines
in
an
inventory
oh
my
dear
monsieur
if
you
had
seen
as
i
then
saw
it
that
huge
room
hung
with
dark
tapestry
you
would
have
imagined
yourself
transported
into
a
genuine
scene
from
a
novel
it
was
icy
cold
and
more
than
that
absolutely
funereal
he
added
raising
his
arm
with
a
theatrical
gesture
and
pausing
for
a
moment
by
looking
hard
and
walking
close
to
the
bed
i
succeeded
in
discovering
madame
de
merret
thanks
to
the
lamp
the
light
of
which
shone
upon
the
pillow
her
face
was
as
yellow
as
wax
and
resembled
two
clasped
hands
she
wore
a
lace
cap
which
revealed
her
lovely
hair
as
white
as
snow
she
was
sitting
up
and
seemed
to
retain
that
position
with
much
difficulty
her
great
black
eyes
dulled
by
fever
no
doubt
and
already
almost
lifeless
hardly
moved
beneath
the
bones
which
the
eyebrows
cover
these
he
said
pointing
to
the
arch
over
his
her
brow
was
moist
her
fleshless
hands
resembled
bones
covered
with
skin
her
veins
and
muscles
could
be
seen
perfectly
she
must
have
been
very
beautiful
but
at
that
moment
i
was
seized
with
an
indefinable
feeling
at
her
aspect
never
before
according
to
those
who
laid
her
out
had
a
living
creature
attained
such
thinness
without
dying
in
short
she
was
horrible
to
look
at
disease
had
so
wasted
that
woman
that
she
was
nothing
more
than
a
phantom
her
pale
violet
lips
seemed
not
to
move
when
she
spoke
to
me
although
my
profession
had
familiarised
me
with
such
spectacles
by
taking
me
sometimes
to
the
pillows
of
dying
persons
to
take
down
their
last
wishes
i
confess
that
the
families
in
tears
and
despair
whom
i
had
seen
were
as
nothing
beside
that
solitary
silent
woman
in
that
enormous
château
i
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
i
could
not
detect
the
movement
which
the
breathing
of
the
sick
woman
should
have
imparted
to
the
sheets
that
covered
her
and
i
stood
quite
still
gazing
at
her
in
a
sort
of
stupor
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
there
now
at
last
her
great
eyes
moved
she
tried
to
raise
her
right
hand
which
fell
back
upon
the
bed
and
these
words
came
from
her
mouth
like
a
breath
for
her
voice
had
already
ceased
to
be
a
voice
have
been
awaiting
you
with
much
impatience
her
cheeks
suddenly
flushed
it
was
a
great
effort
for
her
to
speak
i
said
she
motioned
to
me
to
be
silent
at
that
moment
the
old
nurse
rose
and
whispered
in
my
ear
speak
madame
countess
can
not
bear
to
hear
the
slightest
sound
and
what
you
said
might
excite
her
i
sat
down
a
few
moments
later
madame
de
merret
collected
all
her
remaining
strength
to
move
her
right
arm
and
thrust
it
not
without
infinite
difficulty
beneath
her
bolster
she
paused
for
just
a
moment
then
she
made
a
last
effort
to
withdraw
her
hand
and
when
she
finally
produced
a
sealed
paper
drops
of
sweat
fell
from
her
place
my
will
in
your
hands
she
said
oh
that
was
all
she
grasped
a
crucifix
that
lay
on
her
bed
hastily
put
it
to
her
lips
and
died
the
expression
of
her
staring
eyes
makes
me
shudder
even
now
when
i
think
of
it
she
must
have
suffered
terribly
there
was
a
gleam
of
joy
in
her
last
glance
a
sentiment
which
remained
in
her
dead
eyes
i
carried
the
will
away
and
when
it
was
opened
i
found
that
madame
de
merret
had
appointed
me
her
executor
she
left
all
her
property
to
the
hospital
at
vendôme
with
the
exception
of
a
few
individual
legacies
but
these
were
her
provisions
with
respect
to
la
grande
bretèche
she
directed
me
to
leave
her
house
for
fifty
years
from
the
day
of
her
death
in
the
same
condition
as
at
the
moment
that
she
died
forbidding
any
person
whatsoever
to
enter
the
rooms
forbidding
the
slightest
repairs
to
be
made
and
even
setting
aside
a
sum
in
order
to
hire
keepers
if
it
should
be
found
necessary
to
assure
the
literal
execution
of
her
purpose
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
if
the
desire
of
the
testatrix
has
been
carried
out
the
house
is
to
belong
to
my
heirs
for
monsieur
knows
that
notaries
can
not
accept
legacies
if
not
la
grande
bretèche
is
to
revert
to
whoever
is
entitled
to
it
but
with
the
obligation
to
comply
with
the
conditions
set
forth
in
a
codicil
attached
to
the
will
which
is
not
to
be
opened
until
the
expiration
of
the
said
fifty
years
the
will
was
not
attacked
and
so
at
that
without
finishing
his
sentence
the
elongated
notary
glanced
at
me
with
a
triumphant
air
and
i
made
him
altogether
happy
by
addressing
a
few
compliments
to
him
monsieur
i
said
you
have
made
a
profound
impression
upon
me
so
that
i
think
i
see
that
dying
woman
paler
than
her
sheets
her
gleaming
eyes
terrify
me
and
i
shall
dream
of
her
but
you
must
have
formed
some
conjecture
concerning
the
provisions
of
that
extraordinary
will
monsieur
he
said
with
a
comical
reserve
i
never
allow
myself
to
judge
the
conduct
of
those
persons
who
honour
me
by
giving
me
a
diamond
i
soon
loosened
the
tongue
of
the
scrupulous
vendômese
notary
who
communicated
to
me
not
without
long
digressions
observations
due
to
the
profound
politicians
of
both
sexes
whose
decrees
are
law
in
vendôme
but
those
observations
were
so
contradictory
and
so
diffuse
that
i
almost
fell
asleep
despite
the
interest
i
took
in
that
authentic
narrative
the
dull
and
monotonous
tone
of
the
notary
who
was
accustomed
no
doubt
to
listen
to
himself
and
to
force
his
clients
and
his
fellow
citizens
to
listen
to
him
triumphed
over
my
curiosity
aha
many
people
monsieur
he
said
to
me
on
the
landing
would
like
to
live
years
more
but
just
a
minute
and
with
a
sly
expression
he
placed
his
right
forefinger
on
his
nose
as
if
he
would
have
said
just
mark
what
i
say
but
to
do
that
to
do
that
he
added
a
man
must
be
less
than
sixty
i
closed
my
door
having
been
roused
from
my
apathy
by
this
last
shaft
which
the
notary
considered
very
clever
then
i
seated
myself
in
my
placing
my
feet
on
the
andirons
i
was
soon
absorbed
in
an
imaginary
romance
radcliffe
based
upon
the
judicial
observations
of
monsieur
regnault
when
my
door
under
the
skillful
manipulation
of
a
woman
hand
turned
upon
its
hinges
my
hostess
appeared
a
stout
woman
of
excellent
disposition
who
had
missed
her
vocation
she
was
a
fleming
who
should
have
been
born
in
a
picture
by
teniers
well
monsieur
she
said
no
doubt
monsieur
regnault
has
given
you
his
story
of
la
grande
bretèche
yes
mother
lepas
what
did
he
tell
you
i
repeated
in
a
few
words
the
chilling
and
gloomy
story
of
madame
de
merret
at
each
sentence
my
hostess
thrust
out
her
neck
gazing
at
me
with
the
true
innkeeper
perspicacity
a
sort
of
happy
medium
between
the
instinct
of
the
detective
the
cunning
of
the
spy
and
the
craft
of
the
trader
my
dear
madame
lepas
i
added
as
i
concluded
you
evidently
know
more
eh
if
not
why
should
you
have
come
up
here
oh
on
an
honest
woman
word
as
true
as
my
name
lepas
do
swear
your
eyes
are
big
with
a
secret
you
knew
monsieur
de
merret
what
sort
of
a
man
was
he
bless
my
soul
monsieur
de
merret
was
a
fine
man
whom
you
never
could
see
the
whole
of
he
was
so
long
an
excellent
gentleman
who
came
here
from
picardy
and
who
had
his
brains
very
near
his
cap
as
we
say
here
he
paid
cash
for
everything
in
order
not
to
have
trouble
with
anybody
you
see
he
was
lively
we
women
all
found
him
very
agreeable
because
he
was
lively
i
asked
that
may
be
she
said
you
know
monsieur
that
a
man
must
have
had
something
in
front
of
him
as
they
say
to
marry
madame
de
merret
who
without
saying
anything
against
the
others
was
the
loveliest
and
richest
woman
in
the
whole
province
she
had
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
the
whole
town
went
to
her
wedding
the
bride
was
dainty
and
attractive
a
real
jewel
of
a
woman
ah
they
made
a
handsome
couple
at
that
time
did
they
live
happily
together
oh
dear
oh
dear
yes
and
no
so
far
as
any
one
could
tell
for
as
you
can
imagine
we
folks
did
live
on
intimate
terms
with
them
madame
de
merret
was
a
woman
very
pleasant
who
had
to
suffer
sometimes
perhaps
from
her
husband
quick
temper
but
although
he
was
a
bit
proud
we
liked
him
you
see
it
was
his
business
to
be
like
that
when
a
man
is
noble
you
know
however
some
catastrophe
must
have
happened
to
make
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
separate
so
violently
i
did
say
there
was
any
catastrophe
monsieur
i
do
know
anything
about
it
good
i
am
sure
now
that
you
know
all
about
it
well
monsieur
i
tell
you
all
i
know
when
i
saw
monsieur
regnault
come
up
to
your
room
i
had
an
idea
that
he
would
talk
to
you
about
madame
de
merret
in
connection
with
la
grande
bretèche
that
gave
me
the
idea
of
consulting
with
monsieur
who
seems
to
me
a
man
of
good
judgment
and
incapable
of
playing
false
with
a
poor
woman
like
me
who
never
did
anybody
any
harm
and
yet
who
troubled
by
her
conscience
up
to
this
time
i
never
dared
to
speak
out
to
the
people
of
this
neighbourhood
for
they
all
gossips
and
then
monsieur
i
never
had
a
guest
stay
in
my
inn
so
long
as
you
have
and
to
whom
i
could
tell
the
story
of
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
my
dear
madame
lepas
i
said
arresting
the
flood
of
her
words
if
your
confidence
is
likely
to
compromise
me
i
would
be
burdened
with
it
for
a
moment
for
anything
in
the
world
do
be
afraid
she
said
interrupting
me
you
shall
see
this
eagerness
on
her
part
made
me
think
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
to
whom
my
worthy
hostess
had
communicated
the
secret
of
which
i
dreaded
to
be
the
only
confidant
and
i
listened
monsieur
she
began
when
the
emperor
sent
spanish
or
other
prisoners
of
war
here
i
had
to
board
at
the
expense
of
the
government
a
young
spaniard
who
was
sent
to
vendôme
on
parole
in
spite
of
the
parole
he
went
every
day
to
show
himself
to
the
subprefect
he
was
a
spanish
grandee
nothing
less
he
had
a
name
in
and
something
like
bagos
de
férédia
i
have
his
name
written
on
my
register
you
can
read
it
if
you
wish
he
was
a
fine
young
man
for
a
spaniard
who
they
say
are
all
ugly
he
was
only
five
feet
two
or
three
inches
tall
but
he
was
he
had
little
hands
which
he
took
care
of
oh
you
should
have
seen
he
had
as
many
brushes
for
his
hands
as
a
woman
has
for
all
purposes
he
had
long
black
hair
a
flashing
eye
and
rather
a
skin
which
i
liked
all
the
same
he
wore
such
fine
linen
as
i
never
saw
before
on
any
one
although
i
have
entertained
princesses
and
among
others
general
bertrand
the
duke
and
duchess
monsieur
decazes
and
the
king
of
spain
he
did
eat
much
but
he
had
polite
and
pleasant
manners
so
that
i
could
be
angry
with
him
for
it
oh
i
was
very
fond
of
him
although
he
did
say
four
words
a
day
and
it
was
impossible
to
have
the
slightest
conversation
with
him
if
any
one
spoke
to
him
he
would
answer
it
was
a
fad
a
mania
that
they
all
have
so
they
tell
me
he
read
his
breviary
like
a
priest
he
went
to
mass
and
to
all
the
services
regularly
where
did
he
sit
we
noticed
that
later
about
two
steps
from
madame
de
merret
private
chapel
as
he
took
his
seat
there
the
first
time
that
he
came
to
the
church
nobody
imagined
that
there
was
any
design
in
it
besides
he
never
took
his
face
off
his
the
poor
young
man
in
the
evening
monsieur
he
used
to
walk
on
the
mountain
among
the
ruins
of
the
château
that
was
the
poor
man
only
amusement
he
was
reminded
of
his
own
country
there
they
say
that
there
nothing
but
mountains
in
spain
very
soon
after
he
came
here
he
began
to
stay
out
late
i
was
anxious
when
he
did
come
home
till
midnight
but
we
all
got
used
to
his
whim
he
would
take
the
key
of
the
door
and
we
would
wait
for
him
he
lived
in
a
house
that
we
have
on
rue
de
casernes
then
one
of
our
stablemen
told
us
that
one
night
when
he
took
the
horses
to
drink
he
thought
he
saw
the
spanish
grandee
swimming
far
out
in
the
river
like
a
real
fish
when
he
came
back
i
told
him
to
be
careful
of
the
he
seemed
vexed
that
he
had
been
seen
in
the
water
at
last
monsieur
one
day
or
rather
one
morning
we
did
find
him
in
his
room
he
had
come
home
by
hunting
carefully
everywhere
i
found
a
writing
in
his
table
drawer
where
there
were
fifty
of
the
spanish
which
they
call
and
which
were
worth
about
five
thousand
francs
and
then
there
was
ten
thousand
worth
of
diamonds
in
a
little
sealed
box
his
writing
said
that
in
case
he
did
return
he
left
us
this
money
and
his
diamonds
on
condition
that
we
would
found
masses
to
thank
god
for
his
escape
and
his
salvation
in
those
days
i
still
had
my
man
who
went
out
to
look
for
him
and
here
the
funny
part
of
the
story
he
brought
back
the
spaniard
clothes
which
he
found
under
a
big
stone
in
a
sort
of
shed
by
the
river
on
the
château
side
almost
opposite
la
grande
bretèche
my
husband
went
there
so
early
that
no
one
saw
him
he
burned
the
clothes
after
reading
the
letter
and
we
declared
according
to
count
férédia
wish
that
he
had
escaped
the
subprefect
set
all
the
gendarmerie
on
his
track
but
bless
my
soul
they
never
caught
him
lepas
believed
that
the
spaniard
had
drowned
himself
for
my
part
monsieur
i
do
think
it
i
think
rather
that
he
was
mixed
up
in
madame
de
merret
business
seeing
that
rosalie
told
me
that
the
crucifix
that
her
mistress
thought
so
much
of
that
she
had
it
buried
with
her
was
made
of
ebony
and
silver
now
in
the
early
part
of
his
stay
here
monsieur
férédia
had
one
of
silver
and
ebony
which
i
see
tell
me
now
monsieur
is
it
true
that
i
have
any
remorse
about
the
spaniard
fifteen
thousand
francs
and
that
they
are
fairly
mine
certainly
but
did
you
never
try
to
question
rosalie
i
asked
her
oh
yes
indeed
monsieur
but
would
you
believe
it
that
girl
is
like
a
wall
she
knows
something
but
it
impossible
to
make
her
talk
after
conversing
a
moment
more
with
me
my
hostess
left
me
beset
by
undefined
and
dismal
thoughts
by
a
romantic
sort
of
curiosity
a
religious
terror
not
unlike
the
intense
emotion
that
seizes
us
when
we
enter
a
dark
church
at
night
and
see
a
dim
light
in
the
distance
under
the
lofty
arches
a
vague
figure
gliding
along
or
the
rustling
of
a
dress
or
a
surplice
it
makes
us
shudder
la
grande
bretèche
and
its
tall
weeds
its
condemned
windows
its
rusty
ironwork
its
closed
doors
its
deserted
rooms
suddenly
appeared
before
me
in
fantastic
guise
i
tried
to
penetrate
that
mysterious
abode
seeking
there
the
kernel
of
that
sombre
story
of
that
drama
which
had
caused
the
death
of
three
persons
in
my
eyes
rosalie
was
the
most
interesting
person
in
vendôme
as
i
scrutinised
her
i
detected
traces
of
some
inmost
thought
despite
the
robust
health
that
shone
upon
her
plump
cheeks
there
was
in
her
some
seed
of
remorse
or
of
hope
her
manner
announced
a
secret
as
does
that
of
the
devotee
who
prays
with
excessive
fervour
or
that
of
the
infanticide
who
constantly
hears
her
child
last
cry
however
her
attitude
was
artless
and
natural
her
stupid
smile
had
no
trace
of
criminality
and
you
would
have
voted
her
innocent
simply
by
glancing
at
the
large
handkerchief
with
red
and
blue
squares
which
covered
her
vigorous
bust
confined
by
a
gown
with
white
and
violet
stripes
no
i
thought
i
wo
leave
vendôme
without
learning
the
whole
story
of
la
grande
bretèche
to
obtain
my
end
i
will
become
friend
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
rosalie
i
said
one
evening
what
is
it
monsieur
you
are
not
married
she
started
slightly
oh
i
lack
men
when
i
take
a
fancy
to
be
unhappy
she
said
with
a
laugh
she
speedily
overcame
her
inward
emotion
for
all
women
from
the
great
lady
down
to
the
servant
at
an
inn
have
a
which
is
peculiar
to
them
you
are
fresh
and
appetising
enough
not
to
lack
suitors
but
tell
me
rosalie
why
did
you
go
to
work
in
an
inn
when
you
left
madame
de
merret
did
she
leave
you
some
money
oh
yes
but
my
place
is
the
best
in
vendôme
monsieur
this
reply
was
one
of
those
which
judges
and
lawyers
call
dilatory
rosalie
seemed
to
me
to
occupy
in
that
romantic
story
the
position
of
the
square
in
the
middle
of
the
chessboard
she
was
at
the
very
centre
of
interest
and
of
truth
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
tied
up
in
the
clew
it
was
no
longer
an
ordinary
case
of
attempting
seduction
there
was
in
that
girl
the
last
chapter
of
a
romance
and
so
from
that
moment
rosalie
became
the
object
of
my
attentions
by
dint
of
studying
the
girl
i
observed
in
her
as
in
all
women
to
whom
we
devote
all
our
thoughts
a
multitude
of
good
qualities
she
was
neat
and
clean
and
she
was
that
goes
without
saying
she
had
also
all
the
attractions
which
our
desire
imparts
to
women
in
whatever
station
of
life
they
may
be
a
fortnight
after
the
notary
visit
i
said
to
rosalie
one
evening
or
rather
one
morning
for
it
was
very
early
tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
madame
de
merret
oh
do
ask
me
that
monsieur
horace
she
replied
in
alarm
her
pretty
face
darkened
her
bright
colour
vanished
and
her
eyes
lost
their
humid
innocent
light
but
i
insisted
well
she
rejoined
as
you
insist
upon
it
i
will
tell
you
but
keep
my
secret
of
course
of
course
my
dear
girl
i
will
keep
all
your
secrets
with
the
probity
of
a
thief
and
that
is
the
most
loyal
probity
that
exists
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
she
said
i
prefer
that
it
should
be
with
your
own
thereupon
she
arranged
her
neckerchief
and
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
for
there
certainly
is
an
attitude
of
trust
and
security
essential
to
the
telling
of
a
story
the
best
stories
are
told
at
a
certain
hour
and
at
the
table
as
we
all
are
now
no
one
ever
told
a
story
well
while
standing
or
fasting
but
if
it
were
necessary
to
reproduce
faithfully
rosalie
diffuse
eloquence
a
whole
volume
would
hardly
suffice
now
as
the
event
of
which
she
gave
me
a
confused
account
occupied
between
the
loquacity
of
the
notary
and
that
of
madame
lepas
the
exact
position
of
the
mean
terms
of
an
arithmetical
proportion
between
the
two
extremes
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
repeat
it
to
you
in
a
few
words
therefore
i
abridge
the
room
which
madame
de
merret
occupied
at
la
grande
bretèche
was
on
the
ground
floor
a
small
closet
about
four
feet
deep
in
the
wall
served
as
her
wardrobe
three
months
before
the
evening
the
incidents
of
which
i
am
about
to
narrate
madame
de
merret
had
been
so
seriously
indisposed
that
her
husband
left
her
alone
in
her
room
and
slept
in
a
room
on
the
first
floor
by
one
of
those
chances
which
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
he
returned
home
on
the
evening
in
question
two
hours
later
than
usual
from
the
club
to
which
he
was
accustomed
to
go
to
read
the
newspapers
and
to
talk
politics
with
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
his
wife
supposed
that
he
had
come
home
and
had
gone
to
bed
and
to
sleep
but
the
invasion
of
france
had
given
rise
to
a
lively
discussion
the
game
of
billiards
had
been
very
close
and
he
had
lost
forty
francs
an
enormous
sum
at
vendôme
where
everybody
hoards
money
and
where
manners
are
confined
within
the
limits
of
a
modesty
worthy
of
all
praise
which
perhaps
is
the
source
of
a
true
happiness
of
which
no
parisian
has
a
suspicion
for
some
time
past
monsieur
de
merret
had
contented
himself
with
asking
rosalie
if
his
wife
were
in
bed
at
the
girl
reply
always
in
the
affirmative
he
went
immediately
to
his
own
room
with
the
readiness
born
of
habit
and
confidence
but
on
returning
home
that
evening
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
madame
de
merret
room
to
tell
her
of
his
misadventure
and
perhaps
also
to
console
himself
for
it
during
dinner
he
had
remarked
that
madame
de
merret
was
very
coquettishly
dressed
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
home
from
the
club
that
his
wife
was
no
longer
ill
that
her
convalescence
had
improved
her
but
he
perceived
it
as
husbands
notice
everything
a
little
late
instead
of
calling
rosalie
who
at
that
moment
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
watching
the
cook
and
the
coachman
play
a
difficult
hand
of
monsieur
de
merret
went
to
his
wife
room
lighted
by
his
lantern
which
he
had
placed
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
his
footstep
easily
recognised
resounded
under
the
arches
of
the
corridor
at
the
instant
that
he
turned
the
knob
of
his
wife
door
he
fancied
that
he
heard
the
door
of
the
closet
that
i
have
mentioned
close
but
when
he
entered
madame
de
merret
was
alone
standing
in
front
of
the
hearth
the
husband
naively
concluded
that
rosalie
was
in
the
closet
however
a
suspicion
that
rang
in
his
ears
like
the
striking
of
a
clock
made
him
distrustful
he
looked
at
his
wife
and
detected
in
her
eyes
something
indefinable
of
confusion
and
dismay
you
come
home
very
late
she
said
that
voice
usually
so
pure
and
so
gracious
seemed
to
him
slightly
changed
he
made
no
reply
but
at
that
moment
rosalie
entered
the
room
that
was
a
thunderclap
to
him
he
walked
about
the
room
from
one
window
to
another
with
a
uniform
step
and
with
folded
arms
have
you
learned
anything
distressing
or
are
you
ill
his
wife
timidly
asked
him
while
rosalie
undressed
her
he
made
no
reply
you
may
go
said
madame
de
merret
to
her
maid
i
will
put
on
my
myself
she
divined
some
catastrophe
simply
from
the
expression
of
her
husband
face
and
she
preferred
to
be
alone
with
him
when
rosalie
was
gone
or
was
supposed
to
be
gone
for
she
stayed
for
some
moments
in
the
corridor
monsieur
de
merret
took
his
stand
in
front
of
his
wife
and
said
to
her
coldly
madame
there
is
some
one
in
your
closet
she
looked
at
her
husband
calmly
and
replied
simply
no
monsieur
that
no
tore
monsieur
de
merret
heart
for
he
did
not
believe
it
and
yet
his
wife
had
never
seemed
to
him
purer
and
more
holy
than
she
seemed
at
that
moment
he
rose
to
open
the
closet
door
madame
de
merret
took
his
hand
stopped
him
looked
at
him
with
a
melancholy
expression
and
said
in
a
voice
strangely
moved
if
you
find
no
one
reflect
that
all
is
at
an
end
between
us
the
indescribable
dignity
of
his
wife
attitude
reawoke
the
gentleman
profound
esteem
for
her
and
inspired
in
him
one
of
those
resolutions
which
require
only
a
vaster
theatre
in
order
to
become
immortal
no
he
said
i
will
not
do
it
josephine
in
either
case
we
should
be
separated
forever
listen
i
know
all
the
purity
of
your
soul
and
i
know
that
you
lead
the
life
of
a
saint
and
that
you
would
not
commit
a
mortal
sin
to
save
your
life
at
these
words
madame
de
merret
looked
at
her
husband
with
a
haggard
eye
see
here
is
your
crucifix
swear
to
me
before
god
that
there
is
no
one
there
and
i
will
believe
you
i
will
never
open
that
door
madame
de
merret
took
the
crucifix
and
said
i
swear
it
louder
said
the
husband
and
repeat
after
me
swear
before
god
that
there
is
no
one
in
that
closet
she
repeated
the
words
without
confusion
it
is
well
said
monsieur
de
merret
coldly
after
a
silence
this
is
a
very
beautiful
thing
that
i
did
not
know
you
possessed
he
said
as
he
examined
the
crucifix
of
ebony
encrusted
with
silver
and
beautifully
carved
i
found
it
at
duvivier
when
that
party
of
prisoners
passed
through
vendôme
last
year
he
bought
it
of
a
spanish
monk
ah
said
monsieur
de
merret
replacing
the
crucifix
on
the
nail
and
he
rang
rosalie
did
not
keep
him
waiting
monsieur
de
merret
walked
hastily
to
meet
her
led
her
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
looking
over
the
garden
and
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
i
know
that
gorenflot
wants
to
marry
you
that
poverty
alone
prevents
you
from
coming
together
and
that
you
have
told
him
that
you
would
not
be
his
wife
until
he
found
some
way
to
become
a
master
mason
well
go
to
him
and
tell
him
to
come
here
with
his
trowel
and
his
tools
manage
so
as
not
to
wake
anybody
in
his
house
but
him
his
fortune
will
exceed
your
desires
above
all
go
out
of
this
house
without
chattering
or
he
frowned
rosalie
started
and
he
called
her
back
here
take
my
he
said
jean
shouted
monsieur
de
merret
in
the
corridor
in
a
voice
of
thunder
jean
who
was
both
his
coachman
and
his
confidential
man
left
his
game
of
and
answered
the
summons
go
to
bed
all
of
you
said
his
master
motioning
to
him
to
come
near
and
he
added
but
in
an
undertone
when
they
are
all
asleep
do
you
understand
you
will
come
down
and
let
me
know
monsieur
de
merret
who
had
not
lost
sight
of
his
wife
while
giving
his
orders
calmly
returned
to
her
side
in
front
of
the
fire
and
began
to
tell
her
about
the
game
of
billiards
and
the
discussion
at
the
club
when
rosalie
returned
she
found
monsieur
and
madame
talking
most
amicably
the
gentleman
had
recently
had
plastered
all
the
rooms
which
composed
his
on
the
ground
floor
plaster
is
very
scarce
in
vendôme
and
the
cost
of
transportation
increases
the
price
materially
so
he
had
purchased
quite
a
large
quantity
knowing
that
he
would
readily
find
customers
for
any
that
he
might
have
left
the
circumstance
suggested
the
design
which
he
proceeded
to
carry
out
gorenflot
is
here
monsieur
said
rosalie
in
an
undertone
let
him
come
in
replied
the
picard
gentleman
aloud
madame
de
merret
turned
pale
when
she
saw
the
mason
gorenflot
said
her
husband
go
out
to
the
and
get
some
bricks
and
bring
in
enough
to
wall
up
the
door
of
this
closet
you
can
use
the
plaster
that
i
had
left
to
plaster
the
wall
then
beckoning
rosalie
and
the
workman
to
him
he
said
in
a
low
tone
look
you
gorenflot
you
will
sleep
here
but
morning
you
shall
have
a
passport
to
go
abroad
to
a
city
which
i
will
name
to
you
i
will
give
you
six
thousand
francs
for
your
journey
you
will
remain
ten
years
in
that
city
if
you
are
not
satisfied
there
you
can
settle
in
another
city
provided
that
it
is
in
the
same
country
you
will
go
by
way
of
paris
where
you
will
wait
for
me
there
i
will
give
you
a
guarantee
to
pay
you
six
thousand
francs
more
on
your
return
in
case
you
have
abided
by
the
conditions
of
our
bargain
at
that
price
you
should
be
willing
to
keep
silent
concerning
what
you
have
done
here
as
for
you
rosalie
i
will
give
you
ten
thousand
francs
which
will
be
paid
to
you
on
the
day
of
your
wedding
provided
that
you
marry
gorenflot
but
in
order
to
be
married
you
will
have
to
be
silent
if
not
no
dower
rosalie
said
madame
de
merret
come
here
and
arrange
my
hair
the
husband
walked
tranquilly
back
and
forth
watching
the
door
the
mason
and
his
wife
but
without
any
outward
sign
of
injurious
suspicion
gorenflot
was
obliged
to
make
a
noise
madame
de
merret
seized
an
opportunity
when
the
workman
was
dropping
some
bricks
and
when
her
husband
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
say
to
rosalie
a
thousand
francs
a
year
to
you
my
dear
child
if
you
can
tell
gorenflot
to
leave
a
crack
at
the
go
and
help
him
she
said
coolly
aloud
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
said
not
a
word
while
gorenflot
was
walling
up
the
door
that
silence
was
the
result
of
design
on
the
husband
part
for
he
did
not
choose
to
allow
his
wife
a
pretext
for
uttering
words
of
double
meaning
and
on
madame
de
merret
part
it
was
either
prudence
or
pride
when
the
wall
was
half
built
the
crafty
mason
seized
a
moment
when
the
gentleman
back
was
turned
to
strike
his
pickaxe
through
one
of
the
panes
of
the
glass
door
that
act
gave
madame
de
merret
to
understand
that
rosalie
had
spoken
to
gorenflot
at
that
moment
all
three
saw
a
man
face
dark
and
sombre
with
black
hair
and
fiery
eyes
before
her
husband
had
turned
the
poor
woman
had
time
to
make
a
motion
of
her
head
to
the
stranger
to
whom
that
signal
meant
hope
at
four
about
daybreak
for
it
was
september
the
work
was
finished
the
mason
remained
in
the
house
under
the
eye
of
jean
and
monsieur
de
merret
slept
in
his
wife
chamber
in
the
morning
on
rising
he
said
carelessly
ah
by
the
way
i
must
go
to
the
mayor
office
for
the
passport
he
put
his
hat
on
his
head
walked
towards
the
door
turned
back
and
took
the
crucifix
his
wife
fairly
trembled
with
joy
he
will
go
to
duvivier
she
thought
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
had
left
the
room
madame
de
merret
rang
for
rosalie
then
in
a
terrible
voice
she
cried
the
pickaxe
the
pickaxe
and
to
work
i
saw
how
gorenflot
understood
last
night
we
shall
have
time
to
make
a
hole
and
stop
it
up
in
a
twinkling
rosalie
brought
her
mistress
a
sort
of
small
axe
and
she
with
an
ardour
which
no
words
can
describe
began
to
demolish
the
wall
she
had
already
loosened
several
bricks
when
as
she
stepped
back
to
deal
a
blow
even
harder
than
the
preceding
ones
she
saw
monsieur
de
merret
behind
her
she
fainted
put
madame
on
her
bed
said
the
gentleman
coldly
anticipating
what
was
likely
to
happen
during
his
absence
he
had
laid
a
trap
for
his
wife
he
had
simply
written
to
the
mayor
and
had
sent
a
messenger
to
duvivier
the
jeweller
arrived
just
as
the
disorder
in
the
room
had
been
repaired
duvivier
asked
monsieur
de
merret
did
you
buy
some
crucifixes
from
the
spaniards
who
passed
through
here
no
monsieur
very
well
i
thank
you
he
said
exchanging
with
his
wife
a
tigerlike
jean
he
added
turning
towards
his
confidential
servant
you
will
have
my
meals
served
in
madame
de
merret
room
she
is
ill
and
i
shall
not
leave
her
until
she
is
well
again
the
cruel
man
remained
with
his
wife
twenty
days
during
the
first
days
when
there
was
a
noise
in
the
closet
and
josephine
attempted
to
implore
him
in
behalf
of
the
dying
unknown
he
replied
not
allowing
her
to
utter
a
word
you
have
sworn
on
the
cross
that
there
was
no
one
there
the
conscript
to
my
dear
friend
albert
marchand
de
la
ribellerie
tours
sometimes
they
saw
him
by
a
phenomenon
of
vision
or
of
locomotion
abolish
space
in
its
two
elements
of
time
and
distance
one
of
which
is
intellectual
and
the
other
physical
history
of
louis
on
a
certain
evening
in
the
month
of
november
the
principal
people
of
carentan
were
gathered
in
the
salon
of
madame
de
dey
at
whose
house
the
assembly
was
held
daily
some
circumstances
which
would
not
have
attracted
attention
in
a
large
city
but
which
were
certain
to
cause
a
flutter
in
a
small
one
lent
to
this
customary
meeting
an
unusual
degree
of
interest
two
days
before
madame
de
dey
had
closed
her
door
to
her
guests
whom
she
had
also
excused
herself
from
receiving
on
the
preceding
day
on
the
pretext
of
an
indisposition
in
ordinary
times
these
two
occurrences
would
have
produced
the
same
effect
in
carentan
that
the
closing
of
all
the
theatres
would
produce
in
paris
in
those
days
existence
was
to
a
certain
extent
incomplete
and
in
the
conduct
of
madame
de
dey
might
have
had
the
most
deplorable
results
the
slightest
venturesome
proceeding
almost
always
became
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
the
nobles
of
that
period
in
order
to
understand
the
intense
curiosity
and
the
cunning
which
enlivened
the
norman
countenances
of
all
those
people
during
the
evening
but
especially
in
order
that
we
may
share
the
secret
anxiety
of
madame
de
dey
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
rôle
that
she
played
at
carentan
as
the
critical
position
in
which
she
found
herself
at
that
moment
was
undoubtedly
identical
with
that
of
many
people
during
the
revolution
the
sympathies
of
more
than
one
reader
will
give
the
needed
touch
of
colour
to
this
narrative
madame
de
dey
the
widow
of
a
and
chevalier
of
the
orders
had
left
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
the
emigration
as
she
possessed
considerable
property
in
the
neighbourhood
of
carentan
she
had
taken
refuge
there
hoping
that
the
influence
of
the
terror
would
not
be
much
felt
so
far
from
paris
this
prevision
based
upon
exact
knowledge
of
the
province
proved
to
be
just
the
revolution
did
little
devastation
in
lower
normandy
although
when
madame
de
dey
visited
her
estates
formerly
she
used
to
see
only
the
noble
families
of
the
province
she
had
from
policy
thrown
her
house
open
to
the
leading
of
the
town
and
to
the
new
authorities
striving
to
make
them
proud
of
their
conquest
of
her
without
arousing
either
hatred
or
jealousy
in
their
minds
gracious
and
amiable
endowed
with
that
indescribable
gentleness
of
manner
which
attracts
without
resort
to
or
to
entreaties
she
had
succeeded
in
winning
general
esteem
by
the
most
exquisite
tact
the
wise
promptings
of
which
had
enabled
her
to
maintain
her
stand
on
the
narrow
line
where
she
could
satisfy
the
demands
of
that
mixed
society
without
humiliating
the
of
the
parvenus
or
offending
that
of
her
former
friends
about
years
of
age
she
still
retained
not
that
fresh
and
buxom
beauty
which
distinguishes
the
young
women
of
lower
normandy
but
a
slender
and
so
to
speak
aristocratic
beauty
her
features
were
small
and
refined
her
figure
slender
and
willowy
when
she
spoke
her
pale
face
would
seem
to
brighten
and
to
take
on
life
her
great
black
eyes
were
full
of
suavity
but
their
placid
and
devout
expression
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
active
principle
of
her
existence
had
ceased
to
be
married
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
to
an
old
and
jealous
soldier
the
falseness
of
her
position
in
the
centre
of
a
dissipated
court
contributed
much
no
doubt
to
cast
a
veil
of
serious
melancholy
over
a
face
on
which
the
charm
and
vivacity
of
love
must
formerly
have
shone
bright
constantly
obliged
to
restrain
the
ingenuous
impulses
the
emotions
of
a
woman
at
a
time
when
she
still
feels
instead
of
reflecting
passion
had
remained
unsullied
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
so
it
was
that
her
principal
attraction
was
due
to
the
youthful
simplicity
which
at
intervals
her
face
betrayed
and
which
gave
to
her
ideas
a
naïve
expression
of
desire
her
aspect
imposed
respect
but
there
were
always
in
her
bearing
and
in
her
voice
symptoms
of
an
outreaching
towards
an
unknown
future
as
in
a
young
girl
the
most
unsusceptible
man
soon
found
himself
falling
in
love
with
her
and
nevertheless
retained
a
sort
of
respectful
dread
inspired
by
her
courteous
manners
which
were
most
imposing
her
soul
naturally
great
and
strengthened
by
painful
struggles
seemed
to
be
too
far
removed
from
the
common
herd
and
men
realised
their
limitations
that
soul
necessarily
demanded
an
exalted
passion
so
that
madame
de
dey
affections
were
concentrated
in
a
single
sentiment
the
sentiment
of
maternity
the
happiness
and
pleasures
of
which
her
married
life
had
been
deprived
she
found
in
her
excessive
love
for
her
son
she
loved
him
not
only
with
the
pure
and
profound
devotion
of
a
mother
but
with
the
coquetry
of
a
mistress
the
jealousy
of
a
wife
she
was
unhappy
when
separated
from
him
anxious
during
his
absence
could
never
see
enough
of
him
lived
only
in
him
and
for
him
in
order
to
make
men
understand
the
strength
of
this
feeling
it
will
suffice
to
add
that
this
son
was
not
only
madame
de
dey
only
child
but
her
last
remaining
relative
the
only
living
being
to
whom
she
could
attach
the
fears
the
hopes
and
the
joys
of
her
life
the
late
count
de
dey
was
the
last
scion
of
his
family
as
she
was
the
last
heiress
of
hers
thus
human
schemes
and
interests
were
in
accord
with
the
noblest
cravings
of
the
soul
to
intensify
in
the
countess
heart
a
sentiment
which
is
always
strong
in
women
she
had
brought
up
her
son
only
with
infinite
difficulty
which
had
made
him
dearer
than
ever
to
her
twenty
times
the
doctors
prophesied
his
death
but
trusting
in
her
presentiments
and
her
hopes
she
had
the
inexpressible
joy
of
seeing
him
pass
through
the
dangers
of
childhood
unscathed
and
of
exulting
in
the
upbuilding
of
his
constitution
in
spite
of
the
decrees
of
the
faculty
thanks
to
constant
care
her
son
had
grown
and
had
attained
such
perfect
development
that
at
twenty
years
of
age
he
was
considered
one
of
the
most
accomplished
cavaliers
at
versailles
lastly
a
piece
of
good
fortune
which
does
not
crown
the
efforts
of
all
mothers
she
was
adored
by
her
son
their
hearts
were
bound
together
by
sympathies
that
were
fraternal
even
if
they
had
not
been
connected
by
the
decree
of
nature
they
would
have
felt
instinctively
for
each
other
that
affection
of
one
being
for
another
so
rarely
met
with
in
life
appointed
sublieutenant
of
dragoons
at
eighteen
the
young
man
had
complied
with
the
prevailing
ideas
of
the
requirements
of
honour
at
that
period
by
following
the
princes
when
they
emigrated
thus
madame
de
dey
of
noble
birth
wealthy
and
the
mother
of
an
émigré
was
fully
alive
to
the
dangers
of
her
painful
situation
as
she
had
no
other
aim
than
to
preserve
a
great
fortune
for
her
son
she
had
renounced
the
happiness
of
accompanying
him
but
when
she
read
the
harsh
laws
by
virtue
of
which
the
republic
daily
confiscated
the
property
of
the
émigrés
at
carentan
she
applauded
herself
for
her
courageous
act
was
she
not
guarding
her
son
treasures
at
the
peril
of
her
life
then
when
she
learned
of
the
shocking
executions
ordered
by
the
convention
she
slept
undisturbed
happy
to
know
that
her
only
treasure
was
in
safety
far
from
all
perils
and
all
scaffolds
she
took
pleasure
in
the
belief
that
she
had
adopted
the
best
course
to
save
all
his
fortunes
at
once
making
the
concessions
to
this
secret
thought
which
the
disasters
of
the
time
demanded
without
compromising
her
womanly
dignity
or
her
aristocratic
beliefs
she
enveloped
her
sorrows
in
impenetrable
mystery
she
had
realised
the
difficulties
which
awaited
her
at
carentan
to
go
thither
and
assume
the
first
place
in
society
was
it
not
equivalent
to
defying
the
scaffold
every
day
but
sustained
by
a
mother
courage
she
succeeded
in
winning
the
affection
of
the
poor
by
relieving
all
sorts
of
misery
indiscriminately
and
made
herself
necessary
to
the
rich
by
taking
the
lead
in
their
pleasures
she
received
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
commune
the
mayor
the
president
of
the
district
the
public
accuser
and
even
the
judges
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
first
four
of
these
functionaries
being
unmarried
paid
court
to
her
in
the
hope
of
marrying
her
whether
by
terrifying
her
by
the
injury
which
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
do
her
or
by
offering
her
their
protection
the
public
accuser
formerly
an
attorney
at
caen
where
he
had
been
employed
by
the
countess
tried
to
win
her
love
by
conduct
full
of
devotion
and
generosity
a
dangerous
scheme
he
was
the
most
formidable
of
all
the
suitors
he
alone
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
his
former
client
large
fortune
his
passion
was
inevitably
intensified
by
all
the
cravings
of
an
avarice
which
rested
upon
almost
unlimited
power
upon
the
right
of
life
or
death
throughout
the
district
this
man
who
was
still
young
displayed
so
much
nobility
in
his
behaviour
that
madame
de
dey
had
been
unable
as
yet
to
make
up
her
mind
concerning
him
but
scorning
the
danger
that
lay
in
a
contest
of
wits
with
normans
she
employed
the
inventive
genius
and
the
cunning
which
nature
has
allotted
to
woman
to
play
those
rivals
against
one
another
by
gaining
time
she
hoped
to
arrive
safe
and
sound
at
the
end
of
her
troubles
at
that
time
the
royalists
in
the
interior
of
france
flattered
themselves
that
each
day
would
see
the
close
of
the
revolution
and
that
conviction
was
the
ruin
of
a
great
many
of
them
despite
these
obstacles
the
countess
had
skillfully
maintained
her
independence
down
to
the
day
when
with
incomprehensible
imprudence
she
had
conceived
the
idea
of
closing
her
door
the
interest
which
she
inspired
was
so
profound
and
so
genuine
that
the
people
who
came
to
her
house
that
evening
were
greatly
distressed
when
they
learned
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
receive
them
then
with
the
outspoken
curiosity
which
is
a
part
of
provincial
manners
they
inquired
concerning
the
misfortune
the
sorrow
or
the
disease
which
had
afflicted
madame
de
dey
to
these
questions
an
old
housekeeper
called
brigitte
replied
that
her
mistress
had
shut
herself
into
her
room
and
would
not
see
anybody
not
even
her
servants
the
cloistral
existence
so
to
speak
which
the
people
of
a
small
town
lead
gives
birth
in
them
to
such
an
unconquerable
habit
of
analysing
and
commenting
upon
the
actions
of
other
people
that
after
expressing
their
sympathy
for
madame
de
dey
without
an
idea
whether
she
was
really
happy
or
unhappy
they
all
began
to
speculate
upon
the
causes
of
her
abrupt
seclusion
if
she
were
ill
said
one
curious
individual
she
would
have
sent
for
the
doctor
but
the
doctor
was
at
my
house
all
day
playing
chess
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
in
these
days
there
is
but
one
disease
and
that
is
unfortunately
incurable
this
jest
was
put
forward
apologetically
thereupon
men
women
old
men
and
maidens
began
to
search
the
vast
field
of
conjecture
every
one
fancied
that
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
secret
and
that
secret
engrossed
the
imaginations
of
them
all
the
next
day
the
suspicions
became
embittered
as
life
in
a
small
town
is
open
to
all
the
women
were
the
first
to
learn
that
brigitte
had
laid
in
more
supplies
than
usual
at
the
market
that
fact
could
not
be
denied
brigitte
had
been
seen
in
the
morning
in
the
square
and
a
most
extraordinary
thing
she
had
bought
the
only
hare
that
was
offered
for
sale
now
the
whole
town
knew
that
madame
de
dey
did
not
like
game
the
hare
became
the
for
endless
suppositions
when
taking
their
daily
walk
old
men
observed
in
the
countess
house
a
sort
of
concentrated
activity
which
was
made
manifest
by
the
very
precautions
which
the
servants
took
to
conceal
it
the
valet
was
seen
beating
a
rug
in
the
garden
on
the
day
before
no
one
would
have
paid
any
heed
to
it
but
that
rug
became
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
to
support
the
romances
which
everybody
was
engaged
in
constructing
every
person
had
his
own
on
the
second
day
when
they
learned
that
madame
de
dey
proclaimed
that
she
was
indisposed
the
principal
persons
of
carentan
met
in
the
evening
at
the
house
of
the
mayor
brother
an
a
married
man
of
upright
character
and
generally
esteemed
and
for
whom
the
countess
entertained
a
high
regard
there
all
the
aspirants
to
the
rich
widow
hand
had
a
more
or
less
probable
story
to
tell
and
each
of
them
hoped
to
turn
to
his
advantage
the
secret
circumstances
which
forced
her
to
compromise
herself
thus
the
public
accuser
imagined
a
complete
drama
in
which
madame
de
dey
son
was
brought
to
her
house
by
night
the
mayor
favoured
the
idea
of
a
priest
who
had
not
taken
the
oath
arriving
from
la
vendée
and
asking
her
for
shelter
but
the
purchase
of
a
hare
on
friday
embarrassed
the
mayor
greatly
the
president
of
the
district
was
strong
in
his
conviction
that
it
was
a
leader
of
chouans
or
of
vendeans
hotly
pursued
others
suggested
a
nobleman
escaped
from
one
of
the
prisons
of
paris
in
short
one
and
all
suspected
the
countess
of
being
guilty
of
one
of
those
acts
of
generosity
which
the
laws
of
that
day
stigmatised
as
crimes
and
which
might
lead
to
the
scaffold
the
public
accuser
said
in
an
undertone
that
they
must
hold
their
tongues
and
try
to
snatch
the
unfortunate
woman
from
the
abyss
towards
which
she
was
rapidly
precipitating
herself
if
you
talk
about
this
business
he
added
i
shall
be
obliged
to
interfere
to
search
her
house
and
then
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
they
all
understood
his
reticence
the
countess
sincere
friends
were
so
alarmed
for
her
that
during
the
morning
of
the
third
day
the
of
the
commune
caused
his
wife
to
write
her
a
note
to
urge
her
to
receive
as
usual
that
evening
the
old
merchant
being
bolder
called
at
madame
de
dey
house
in
the
morning
trusting
in
the
service
which
he
proposed
to
render
her
he
demanded
to
be
shown
to
her
presence
and
was
thunderstruck
when
he
saw
her
in
the
garden
engaged
in
cutting
the
last
flowers
from
the
beds
to
supply
her
vases
doubtless
she
has
been
sheltering
her
lover
said
the
old
man
to
himself
seized
with
compassion
for
the
fascinating
woman
the
strange
expression
on
the
countess
face
confirmed
him
in
his
suspicions
deeply
touched
by
that
devotion
so
natural
to
a
woman
and
which
always
moves
our
admiration
because
all
men
are
flattered
by
the
sacrifices
which
a
woman
makes
for
a
man
the
merchant
informed
the
countess
of
the
reports
which
were
current
in
the
town
and
of
the
dangerous
position
in
which
she
stood
but
he
said
as
he
concluded
although
there
are
some
among
our
officials
who
are
not
indisposed
to
forgive
you
for
an
act
of
heroism
of
which
a
priest
is
the
object
no
one
will
pity
you
if
they
discover
that
you
are
sacrificing
yourself
to
the
affections
of
the
heart
at
these
words
madame
de
dey
looked
at
the
old
man
with
an
expression
of
desperation
and
terror
which
made
him
shudder
old
man
though
he
was
come
said
she
taking
his
hand
and
leading
him
to
her
bedroom
where
after
making
sure
that
they
were
alone
she
took
from
her
bosom
a
soiled
and
wrinkled
letter
read
she
cried
making
a
violent
effort
to
pronounce
the
word
she
fell
into
her
chair
as
if
utterly
overwhelmed
while
the
old
gentleman
was
feeling
for
his
spectacles
and
wiping
them
she
fastened
her
eyes
upon
him
and
scrutinised
him
for
the
first
time
with
curiosity
then
she
said
softly
in
an
altered
voice
i
trust
you
am
i
not
sharing
your
crime
replied
the
old
man
simply
she
started
for
the
first
time
her
heart
found
itself
in
sympathy
with
another
heart
in
that
little
town
the
old
merchant
suddenly
understood
both
the
distress
and
the
joy
of
the
countess
her
son
had
taken
part
in
the
granville
expedition
he
wrote
to
his
mother
from
prison
imparting
to
her
one
sad
but
sweet
hope
having
no
doubt
of
his
success
in
escaping
he
mentioned
three
days
in
which
he
might
appear
at
her
house
in
disguise
the
fatal
letter
contained
heartrending
farewells
in
case
he
should
not
be
at
carentan
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
and
he
begged
his
mother
to
hand
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
the
messenger
who
had
undertaken
to
carry
that
letter
to
her
through
innumerable
perils
the
paper
shook
in
the
old
man
hand
and
this
is
the
third
day
cried
madame
de
dey
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
seized
the
letter
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
you
have
been
imprudent
said
the
merchant
why
did
you
lay
in
provisions
why
he
may
arrive
almost
starved
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
she
did
not
finish
i
am
sure
of
my
brother
said
the
old
man
and
i
will
go
and
enlist
him
on
your
side
in
this
emergency
the
old
tradesman
recovered
the
shrewdness
which
he
had
formerly
displayed
in
his
business
and
gave
advice
instinct
with
prudence
and
sagacity
after
agreeing
upon
all
that
they
were
both
to
say
and
to
do
the
old
man
went
about
on
cleverly
devised
pretexts
to
the
principal
houses
of
carentan
where
he
announced
that
madame
de
dey
whom
he
had
just
seen
would
receive
that
evening
in
spite
of
her
indisposition
pitting
his
shrewdness
against
the
inborn
norman
cunning
in
the
examination
to
which
each
family
subjected
him
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
countess
illness
he
succeeded
in
leading
astray
almost
everybody
who
was
interested
in
that
mysterious
affair
his
first
visit
produced
a
marvellous
effect
he
stated
in
the
presence
of
a
gouty
old
lady
that
madame
de
dey
had
nearly
died
of
an
attack
of
gout
in
the
stomach
as
the
famous
tronchin
had
once
recommended
her
in
such
a
case
to
place
on
her
chest
the
skin
of
a
hare
flayed
alive
and
to
stay
in
bed
and
not
move
the
countess
who
had
been
at
death
door
two
days
before
having
followed
scrupulously
tronchin
advice
found
herself
sufficiently
recovered
to
see
those
who
cared
to
call
on
her
that
evening
that
fable
had
a
prodigious
success
and
the
carentan
doctor
a
royalist
in
secret
added
to
its
effect
by
the
air
of
authority
with
which
he
discussed
the
remedy
nevertheless
suspicion
had
taken
too
deep
root
in
the
minds
of
some
obstinate
persons
or
some
philosophers
to
be
entirely
dispelled
so
that
in
the
evening
those
who
were
regular
habitués
of
madame
de
dey
salon
arrived
there
early
some
in
order
to
watch
her
face
others
from
friendly
regard
and
the
majority
were
impressed
by
the
marvellous
nature
of
her
recovery
they
found
the
countess
seated
at
the
corner
of
the
huge
fireplace
of
her
salon
which
was
almost
as
modestly
furnished
as
those
of
the
people
of
carentan
for
in
order
not
to
offend
the
sensitive
of
her
guests
she
denied
herself
the
luxury
to
which
she
had
always
been
accustomed
and
had
changed
nothing
in
her
house
the
floor
of
the
was
not
even
polished
she
left
dark
tapestries
on
the
walls
she
retained
the
native
furniture
burned
tallow
candles
and
followed
the
customs
of
the
town
espousing
provincial
life
and
recoiling
neither
from
the
most
rasping
pettinesses
nor
the
most
unpleasant
privations
but
realising
that
her
guests
would
forgive
her
for
any
display
of
splendour
which
aimed
at
their
personal
comfort
she
neglected
nothing
when
it
was
a
question
of
affording
them
enjoyment
so
that
she
always
gave
them
excellent
dinners
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
make
a
pretence
at
miserliness
to
please
those
calculating
minds
and
after
causing
certain
concessions
in
the
way
of
luxurious
living
to
be
extorted
from
her
she
seemed
to
comply
with
a
good
grace
about
seven
in
the
evening
therefore
the
best
of
the
uninteresting
society
of
carentan
was
assembled
at
her
house
and
formed
a
large
circle
about
the
fireplace
the
mistress
of
the
house
sustained
in
her
misery
by
the
compassionate
glances
which
the
old
tradesman
bestowed
upon
her
submitted
with
extraordinary
courage
to
the
minute
questionings
the
trivial
and
stupid
reasoning
of
her
guests
but
at
every
blow
of
the
knocker
at
her
door
and
whenever
she
heard
footsteps
in
the
street
she
concealed
her
emotion
by
raising
some
question
of
interest
to
the
welfare
of
the
province
she
started
noisy
discussions
concerning
the
quality
of
the
season
cider
and
was
so
well
seconded
by
her
confidant
that
her
company
almost
forgot
to
watch
her
her
manner
was
so
natural
and
her
so
imperturbable
the
public
accuser
and
one
of
the
judges
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
sat
silent
carefully
watching
every
movement
of
her
face
and
listening
to
every
sound
in
the
house
notwithstanding
the
uproar
and
on
several
occasions
they
asked
her
very
embarrassing
questions
which
however
the
countess
answered
with
marvellous
presence
of
mind
mothers
have
such
an
inexhaustible
store
of
courage
when
madame
de
dey
had
arranged
the
placed
everybody
at
a
table
of
boston
reversis
or
whist
she
remained
a
few
moments
talking
with
some
young
people
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
playing
her
part
like
a
consummate
actress
she
suggested
a
game
of
loto
said
that
she
alone
knew
where
it
was
and
disappeared
i
am
suffocating
my
poor
brigitte
she
cried
wiping
away
the
tears
that
gushed
from
her
eyes
which
gleamed
with
fever
anxiety
and
impatience
he
does
not
come
she
continued
looking
about
the
chamber
to
which
she
had
flown
here
i
breathe
again
and
i
live
a
few
moments
more
and
he
will
be
here
for
he
still
lives
i
am
certain
my
heart
tells
me
so
do
you
hear
nothing
brigitte
oh
i
would
give
the
rest
of
my
life
to
know
whether
he
is
in
prison
or
travelling
through
the
country
i
would
like
not
to
think
she
looked
about
again
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
in
order
in
the
room
a
bright
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
the
shutters
were
carefully
closed
the
furniture
glistened
with
cleanliness
the
way
in
which
the
bed
was
made
proved
that
the
countess
had
assisted
brigitte
in
the
smallest
details
and
her
hopes
betrayed
themselves
in
the
scrupulous
care
which
seemed
to
have
been
taken
in
that
room
where
the
sweet
charm
of
love
and
its
most
chaste
caresses
exhaled
in
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
a
mother
alone
could
have
anticipated
the
desires
of
a
soldier
and
have
arranged
to
fulfil
them
all
so
perfectly
a
dainty
meal
choice
wines
clean
linen
and
dry
shoes
in
a
word
all
that
was
likely
to
be
necessary
or
agreeable
to
a
weary
traveller
was
there
set
forth
so
that
he
need
lack
nothing
so
that
the
joy
of
home
might
make
known
to
him
a
mother
love
brigitte
said
the
countess
in
a
heartrending
tone
as
she
placed
a
chair
at
the
table
as
if
to
give
reality
to
her
longings
to
intensify
the
strength
of
her
illusions
oh
he
will
come
madame
he
is
far
away
i
do
doubt
that
alive
and
on
his
way
here
replied
brigitte
i
put
a
key
in
the
bible
and
i
held
it
on
my
fingers
while
cottin
read
the
gospel
of
john
and
madame
the
key
did
turn
is
that
a
sure
sign
asked
the
countess
oh
it
is
certain
madame
i
would
wager
my
salvation
that
he
is
still
alive
god
ca
make
a
mistake
despite
the
danger
that
awaits
him
here
i
would
like
right
well
to
see
him
poor
monsieur
auguste
cried
brigitte
i
suppose
he
is
somewhere
on
the
road
on
foot
and
there
is
the
church
clock
striking
eight
cried
the
countess
in
dismay
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
remained
longer
than
she
ought
in
that
room
where
she
had
faith
in
the
life
of
her
son
because
she
looked
upon
all
that
meant
life
to
him
she
went
but
before
entering
the
salon
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
listening
to
see
if
any
sound
woke
the
silent
echoes
of
the
town
she
smiled
at
brigitte
husband
who
was
on
and
whose
eyes
seemed
dazed
by
dint
of
strained
attention
to
the
murmurs
in
the
square
and
in
the
streets
she
saw
her
son
in
everything
and
everywhere
in
a
moment
she
returned
to
the
salon
affecting
a
jovial
air
and
began
to
play
loto
with
some
young
girls
but
from
time
to
time
she
complained
of
feeling
ill
and
returned
to
her
chair
at
the
fireplace
such
was
the
condition
of
persons
and
things
in
the
house
of
madame
de
dey
while
on
the
road
from
paris
to
cherbourg
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
dark
carmagnole
the
regulation
costume
at
that
period
strode
along
towards
carentan
at
the
beginning
of
the
conscription
there
was
little
or
no
discipline
the
demands
of
the
moment
made
it
impossible
for
the
republic
to
equip
all
of
its
soldiers
at
once
and
it
was
no
rare
thing
to
see
the
roads
covered
with
conscripts
still
wearing
their
civilian
dress
these
young
men
marched
in
advance
of
their
battalions
to
the
or
loitered
behind
for
their
progress
was
regulated
by
their
ability
to
endure
the
fatigue
of
a
long
march
the
traveller
with
whom
we
have
to
do
was
some
distance
in
advance
of
the
column
of
conscripts
on
its
way
to
cherbourg
which
the
mayor
of
carentan
was
momentarily
expecting
in
order
to
distribute
among
them
the
young
man
walked
with
a
heavy
but
still
firm
step
and
his
bearing
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
hardships
of
military
life
although
the
moon
was
shining
on
the
pastures
about
carentan
he
had
noticed
some
great
white
clouds
which
seemed
on
the
point
of
discharging
snow
upon
the
country
and
the
fear
of
being
surprised
by
a
storm
doubtless
quickened
his
gait
which
was
more
rapid
than
his
weariness
made
comfortable
he
had
an
almost
empty
knapsack
on
his
back
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
boxwood
cane
cut
from
one
of
the
high
broad
hedges
formed
by
that
shrub
around
most
of
the
estates
in
lower
normandy
the
solitary
traveller
entered
carentan
whose
towers
of
fantastic
aspect
in
the
moonlight
had
appeared
to
him
a
moment
before
his
steps
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
silent
streets
where
he
met
no
one
he
was
obliged
to
ask
a
weaver
who
was
still
at
work
to
point
out
the
mayor
abode
that
magistrate
lived
only
a
short
distance
away
and
the
conscript
soon
found
himself
safe
under
the
porch
of
his
house
where
he
seated
himself
on
a
stone
bench
waiting
for
the
which
he
had
asked
for
but
being
summoned
by
the
mayor
he
appeared
before
him
and
was
subjected
to
a
careful
examination
the
soldier
was
a
young
man
of
attractive
appearance
who
apparently
belonged
to
some
family
of
distinction
his
manner
indicated
noble
birth
and
the
intelligence
due
to
a
good
education
was
manifest
in
his
features
what
is
your
name
the
mayor
asked
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
him
julien
jussieu
replied
the
conscript
and
you
come
from
said
the
magistrate
with
an
incredulous
smile
from
paris
your
comrades
must
be
far
behind
continued
the
norman
in
a
mocking
tone
i
am
three
leagues
ahead
of
the
battalion
doubtless
some
sentimental
reason
brings
you
to
carentan
citizen
conscript
queried
the
mayor
slyly
it
is
all
right
he
added
imposing
silence
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
upon
the
young
man
who
was
about
to
speak
we
know
where
to
send
you
here
he
said
handing
him
the
here
there
was
a
perceptible
tinge
of
irony
in
the
tone
in
which
the
magistrate
uttered
these
last
two
words
as
he
held
out
a
ticket
upon
which
madame
de
dey
name
was
written
the
young
man
read
the
address
with
an
air
of
curiosity
he
knows
very
well
that
he
has
far
to
go
and
when
he
gets
outside
it
wo
take
him
long
to
cross
the
square
cried
the
mayor
speaking
to
himself
while
the
young
man
went
out
he
a
bold
young
fellow
may
god
protect
him
he
has
an
answer
for
everything
however
if
any
other
than
i
had
asked
to
see
his
papers
he
would
have
been
lost
at
that
moment
the
clock
of
carentan
struck
half
past
nine
the
torches
were
being
lighted
in
madame
de
dey
anteroom
and
the
servants
were
assisting
their
masters
and
mistresses
to
put
on
their
cloaks
their
overcoats
and
their
mantles
the
had
settled
their
accounts
and
were
about
to
withdraw
in
a
body
according
to
the
usual
custom
in
all
small
towns
it
seems
that
the
public
accuser
proposes
to
remain
said
a
lady
observing
that
that
important
functionary
was
missing
when
they
were
about
to
separate
to
seek
their
respective
homes
after
exhausting
all
the
formulas
of
the
redoubtable
magistrate
was
in
fact
alone
with
the
countess
who
waited
in
fear
and
trembling
until
it
should
please
him
to
go
citizeness
he
said
at
length
after
a
long
silence
in
which
there
was
something
horrible
i
am
here
to
see
that
the
laws
of
the
republic
are
observed
madame
de
dey
shuddered
have
you
no
revelations
to
make
to
me
he
demanded
none
she
replied
in
amazement
ah
madame
cried
the
accuser
sitting
down
beside
her
and
changing
his
tone
at
this
moment
for
lack
of
a
word
either
you
or
i
may
bring
our
heads
to
the
scaffold
i
have
observed
your
temperament
your
heart
your
manners
too
closely
to
share
the
error
into
which
you
have
led
your
guests
you
are
expecting
your
son
i
am
absolutely
certain
the
countess
made
a
gesture
of
denial
but
she
had
turned
pale
the
muscles
of
her
face
had
contracted
by
virtue
of
the
overpowering
necessity
to
display
a
deceitful
calmness
and
the
accuser
implacable
eye
lost
none
of
her
movements
very
well
receive
him
continued
the
revolutionary
magistrate
but
do
not
let
him
remain
under
your
roof
later
than
seven
in
the
morning
at
daybreak
i
shall
come
here
armed
with
a
denunciation
which
i
shall
procure
she
gazed
at
him
with
a
stupefied
air
which
would
have
aroused
the
pity
of
a
tigress
i
shall
prove
he
said
in
a
gentle
tone
the
falseness
of
the
denunciation
by
a
thorough
search
and
the
nature
of
my
report
will
place
you
out
of
the
reach
of
any
future
suspicion
i
shall
speak
of
your
patriotic
gifts
of
your
true
citizenship
and
we
shall
be
saved
madame
de
dey
feared
a
trap
she
did
not
move
but
her
face
was
on
fire
and
her
tongue
was
frozen
a
blow
of
the
knocker
rang
through
the
house
ah
cried
the
terrified
mother
falling
on
her
knees
save
him
save
him
yes
let
us
save
him
rejoined
the
public
accuser
with
a
passionate
glance
at
her
let
us
save
him
though
it
cost
our
lives
i
am
lost
she
cried
while
the
accuser
courteously
raised
her
o
madame
he
replied
with
a
grand
oratorical
gesture
i
do
not
choose
to
owe
you
to
any
one
but
yourself
madame
here
he
cried
brigitte
who
thought
that
her
mistress
was
alone
at
sight
of
the
public
accuser
the
old
servant
whose
face
was
flushed
with
joy
became
rigid
and
deathly
pale
what
is
it
brigitte
asked
the
magistrate
in
a
mild
and
meaning
tone
a
conscript
that
the
mayor
has
sent
here
to
lodge
replied
the
servant
showing
the
ticket
that
is
true
said
the
accuser
after
reading
the
paper
a
battalion
is
to
arrive
here
and
he
went
out
the
countess
was
too
anxious
at
that
moment
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
her
former
attorney
to
entertain
the
slightest
suspicion
she
ran
swiftly
having
barely
strength
enough
to
stand
upright
then
she
opened
the
door
of
her
bedroom
saw
her
son
and
rushed
into
his
arms
lifeless
o
my
son
my
son
she
cried
sobbing
and
covering
him
with
frenzied
kisses
madame
said
the
stranger
oh
it
is
he
she
cried
stepping
back
in
dismay
and
standing
before
the
conscript
at
whom
she
gazed
with
a
haggard
expression
blessed
lord
god
what
a
resemblance
said
brigitte
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
the
stranger
himself
shuddered
at
the
aspect
of
madame
de
dey
ah
monsieur
she
said
leaning
upon
brigitte
husband
and
feeling
then
in
all
its
force
the
grief
of
which
the
first
pang
had
almost
killed
her
monsieur
i
can
not
endure
to
see
you
any
longer
allow
my
servants
to
take
my
place
and
to
attend
to
your
wants
she
went
down
to
her
own
apartments
half
carried
by
brigitte
and
her
old
servant
what
madame
cried
the
maid
is
that
man
going
to
sleep
in
monsieur
auguste
bed
wear
monsieur
auguste
slippers
eat
the
pie
that
i
made
for
monsieur
auguste
they
may
guillotine
me
but
i
brigitte
cried
madame
de
dey
hold
your
tongue
chatterbox
said
her
husband
in
a
low
voice
do
you
want
to
kill
madame
at
that
moment
the
conscript
made
a
noise
in
his
room
drawing
his
chair
to
the
table
i
will
not
stay
here
cried
madame
de
dey
i
will
go
to
the
greenhouse
where
i
can
hear
better
what
goes
on
outside
during
the
night
she
was
still
wavering
between
fear
of
having
lost
her
son
and
the
hope
of
seeing
him
appear
the
night
was
disquietingly
silent
there
was
one
ghastly
moment
for
the
countess
when
the
battalion
of
conscripts
marched
into
the
town
and
each
man
repaired
to
his
lodging
there
were
disappointed
hopes
at
every
footstep
and
every
sound
then
nature
resumed
its
terrible
tranquillity
towards
morning
the
countess
was
obliged
to
return
to
her
room
brigitte
who
watched
her
mistress
every
moment
finding
that
she
did
not
come
out
again
went
to
her
room
and
found
the
countess
dead
she
probably
heard
the
conscript
dressing
and
walking
about
in
monsieur
auguste
room
singing
their
d
d
as
if
he
were
in
a
stable
cried
brigitte
it
was
that
which
killed
her
the
countess
death
was
caused
by
a
more
intense
emotion
and
probably
by
some
terrible
vision
at
the
precise
moment
when
madame
de
dey
died
at
carentan
her
son
was
shot
in
le
morbihan
we
might
add
this
tragic
story
to
the
mass
of
other
observations
on
that
sympathy
which
defies
the
law
of
space
documents
which
some
few
solitary
scholars
are
collecting
with
scientific
curiosity
and
which
will
one
day
serve
as
basis
for
a
new
science
a
science
which
till
now
has
lacked
only
its
man
of
genius
a
passion
in
the
desert
the
sight
was
fearful
she
cried
as
we
left
the
menagerie
of
monsieur
martin
she
had
been
watching
that
daring
performer
with
his
hyena
to
speak
in
the
style
of
the
posters
how
on
earth
she
continued
can
he
have
tamed
his
animals
so
as
to
be
sure
enough
of
their
affection
to
that
fact
which
seems
to
you
a
problem
i
replied
interrupting
her
is
however
perfectly
natural
oh
she
exclaimed
while
an
incredulous
smile
flickered
on
her
lip
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
think
that
beasts
are
entirely
devoid
of
passions
i
asked
her
let
me
tell
you
that
we
can
safely
give
them
credit
for
all
the
vices
due
to
our
state
of
civilisation
she
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
astonishment
but
i
continued
when
i
first
saw
monsieur
martin
i
admit
that
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
as
you
did
i
happened
to
be
beside
an
old
soldier
who
had
lost
his
right
leg
and
who
had
gone
into
the
menagerie
with
me
his
face
had
struck
me
it
was
one
of
those
dauntless
faces
stamped
with
the
seal
of
war
upon
which
napoleon
battles
are
written
that
old
trooper
had
above
all
a
frank
and
joyous
manner
which
always
prejudices
me
favourably
doubtless
he
was
one
of
those
fellows
whom
nothing
surprises
who
find
food
for
laughter
in
the
last
contortions
of
a
comrade
whom
they
bury
or
strip
merrily
who
defy
fearlessly
who
never
deliberate
long
and
who
would
fraternise
with
the
devil
after
looking
closely
at
the
proprietor
of
the
menagerie
as
he
came
out
of
the
my
companion
curled
his
lip
expressing
disdain
by
that
sort
of
meaning
glance
which
superior
men
affect
in
order
to
distinguish
themselves
from
dupes
and
so
when
i
waxed
enthusiastic
over
monsieur
martin
courage
he
smiled
and
said
to
me
with
a
knowing
look
shaking
his
head
know
all
about
it
you
do
i
replied
you
will
explain
what
you
mean
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
after
a
few
moments
during
which
we
introduced
ourselves
we
went
to
dine
at
the
first
restaurant
that
we
saw
at
dessert
a
bottle
of
champagne
made
that
interesting
old
soldier
memory
perfectly
clear
he
told
me
his
history
and
i
saw
that
he
was
justified
in
exclaiming
know
all
about
it
when
we
reached
her
house
she
teased
me
so
and
made
me
so
many
promises
that
i
consented
to
repeat
to
her
the
soldier
story
and
so
the
next
day
she
received
this
episode
of
an
epic
which
might
be
entitled
french
in
at
the
time
of
general
desaix
expedition
to
upper
egypt
a
provençal
soldier
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
maugrabins
was
taken
by
those
arabs
to
the
desert
which
lies
beyond
the
cataracts
of
the
nile
in
order
to
place
between
themselves
and
the
french
army
a
sufficient
space
to
ensure
their
safety
the
maugrabins
made
a
forced
march
and
did
not
halt
until
dark
they
camped
about
a
well
concealed
by
near
which
they
had
previously
buried
some
provisions
having
no
idea
that
the
thought
of
flight
would
ever
occur
to
their
prisoner
they
simply
bound
his
hands
and
one
and
all
went
to
sleep
after
eating
a
few
dates
and
giving
their
horses
some
barley
when
the
bold
provençal
saw
that
his
enemies
had
ceased
to
watch
him
he
made
use
of
his
teeth
to
get
possession
of
a
scimitar
then
using
his
knees
to
hold
the
blade
in
place
he
cut
the
cords
which
prevented
him
from
using
his
hands
and
was
free
he
at
once
seized
a
carbine
and
a
poniard
and
took
the
precaution
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
dried
dates
a
small
bag
of
barley
and
some
powder
and
ball
then
he
strapped
a
scimitar
about
his
waist
mounted
a
horse
and
rode
swiftly
away
in
the
direction
in
which
he
supposed
the
french
army
to
be
in
his
haste
to
reach
camp
he
urged
his
already
tired
beast
so
hard
that
the
poor
creature
died
his
flanks
torn
to
shreds
leaving
the
frenchman
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
after
walking
through
the
sand
for
a
long
time
with
the
courage
of
an
escaping
convict
the
soldier
was
obliged
to
stop
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
despite
the
beauty
of
the
sky
of
an
eastern
night
he
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
go
on
luckily
he
had
been
able
to
reach
an
elevation
on
top
of
which
rose
a
few
whose
foliage
seen
long
before
had
aroused
the
sweetest
hope
in
his
heart
his
weariness
was
so
great
that
he
lay
down
upon
a
rock
shaped
like
a
and
fell
asleep
there
without
taking
the
least
precaution
to
protect
himself
while
asleep
the
loss
of
his
life
seemed
inevitable
and
his
last
thought
was
a
regret
he
had
already
repented
of
having
left
the
maugrabins
whose
wandering
life
had
begun
to
seem
delightful
to
him
since
he
was
far
away
from
them
and
helpless
he
was
awakened
by
the
sun
whose
pitiless
rays
falling
perpendicularly
upon
the
granite
caused
an
intolerable
heat
for
the
provençal
had
been
foolish
enough
to
lie
on
the
side
opposite
the
shadow
cast
by
the
majestic
and
verdant
fronds
of
the
he
looked
at
those
solitary
trunks
and
shuddered
they
reminded
him
of
the
graceful
shafts
crowned
with
long
leaves
for
which
the
columns
of
the
saracen
cathedral
at
arles
are
noted
but
when
after
counting
the
he
glanced
about
him
the
most
ghastly
despair
settled
about
his
heart
he
saw
a
boundless
ocean
the
sombre
sands
of
the
desert
stretched
away
in
every
direction
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
glittered
like
a
steel
blade
in
a
bright
light
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
a
sea
of
glass
or
a
succession
of
lakes
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
rising
in
waves
a
fiery
vapour
whirled
above
that
quivering
soil
the
sky
shone
with
a
resplendent
oriental
glare
of
discouraging
purity
for
it
left
nothing
for
the
imagination
to
desire
sky
and
earth
were
aflame
the
silence
terrified
by
its
wild
and
desolate
majesty
the
infinite
vast
expanse
weighed
upon
the
soul
from
every
side
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
not
a
breath
in
the
air
not
a
rift
on
the
surface
of
the
sand
which
seemed
to
move
in
tiny
waves
and
the
horizon
terminated
as
at
sea
in
fine
weather
with
a
line
of
light
as
slender
as
the
edge
of
a
sword
the
provençal
embraced
the
trunk
of
a
as
if
it
were
the
body
of
a
friend
then
sheltered
by
the
straight
slender
shadow
which
the
tree
cast
upon
the
stone
he
wept
seated
himself
anew
and
remained
there
gazing
with
profound
melancholy
at
the
implacable
scene
before
his
eyes
he
shouted
as
if
to
tempt
the
solitude
his
voice
lost
in
the
hollows
of
the
hillock
made
in
the
distance
a
faint
sound
which
awoke
no
echo
the
echo
was
in
his
heart
the
provençal
was
years
old
he
cocked
his
carbine
i
shall
have
time
enough
for
that
he
said
to
himself
as
he
placed
the
weapon
on
the
ground
gazing
alternately
at
the
dark
stretch
of
sand
and
the
blue
expanse
of
the
sky
the
soldier
dreamed
of
france
he
smelt
with
a
thrill
of
rapture
the
gutters
of
paris
he
recalled
the
towns
through
which
he
had
marched
the
faces
of
his
comrades
the
most
trivial
details
of
his
life
in
truth
his
southern
imagination
soon
brought
before
him
the
stones
of
his
dear
provence
in
the
eddying
waves
of
heat
which
shimmered
above
the
vast
sheet
of
the
desert
dreading
all
the
perils
of
that
cruel
mirage
he
descended
the
slope
opposite
that
by
which
he
had
ascended
the
mound
the
night
before
he
was
overjoyed
to
discover
a
sort
of
cave
hollowed
out
by
nature
in
the
huge
fragments
of
granite
which
formed
the
base
of
that
hillock
the
remains
of
a
mat
indicated
that
the
shelter
had
once
been
inhabited
then
a
few
steps
away
he
saw
some
laden
with
dates
at
that
sight
the
instinct
which
attaches
us
to
life
reawoke
in
his
heart
he
hoped
to
live
long
enough
to
await
the
passing
of
some
maugrabins
or
perhaps
he
should
soon
hear
the
roar
of
cannon
for
at
that
moment
bonaparte
was
marching
through
egypt
revived
by
that
thought
the
frenchman
shook
down
several
clusters
of
ripe
fruit
beneath
the
weight
of
which
the
trees
seemed
to
bend
and
he
assured
himself
on
tasting
that
manna
that
the
previous
occupant
of
the
grotto
had
cultivated
the
in
truth
the
fresh
and
toothsome
flesh
of
the
dates
demonstrated
the
care
of
his
predecessor
the
provençal
passed
abruptly
from
the
gloomiest
despair
to
the
most
frantic
joy
he
returned
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
employed
himself
during
the
rest
of
the
day
cutting
down
one
of
the
sterile
which
had
served
him
for
a
roof
the
night
before
a
vague
memory
brought
to
his
mind
the
beasts
of
the
desert
and
anticipating
that
they
might
come
to
drink
at
the
spring
which
gushed
out
of
the
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
bowlders
he
determined
to
guard
himself
against
their
visits
by
placing
a
barrier
against
the
door
of
his
hermitage
despite
his
zeal
despite
the
strength
which
the
fear
of
being
eaten
up
during
his
sleep
gave
him
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
cut
the
into
pieces
during
that
day
but
he
succeeded
in
felling
it
when
towards
evening
that
king
of
the
desert
fell
the
noise
of
its
fall
echoed
in
the
distance
and
the
solitude
uttered
a
sort
of
moan
the
soldier
shuddered
as
if
he
had
heard
a
voice
predicting
disaster
but
like
an
heir
who
does
not
mourn
long
over
the
death
of
his
parent
he
stripped
that
noble
tree
of
the
great
green
leaves
which
are
its
poetic
adornment
and
used
them
to
repair
the
mat
upon
which
he
lay
down
to
sleep
fatigued
by
the
heat
and
hard
work
he
fell
asleep
beneath
the
red
vault
of
the
grotto
in
the
middle
of
the
night
his
slumber
was
disturbed
by
a
peculiar
noise
he
sat
up
and
the
profound
silence
which
prevailed
enabled
him
to
recognise
a
breathing
whose
savage
energy
could
not
belong
to
a
human
being
a
terrible
fear
increased
by
the
dark
the
silence
and
the
bewilderment
of
the
first
waking
moments
froze
his
heart
indeed
he
already
felt
the
painful
contraction
of
his
hair
when
by
dint
of
straining
his
eyes
he
perceived
in
the
darkness
two
faint
amber
lights
at
first
he
attributed
those
lights
to
the
reflection
of
his
own
eyes
but
soon
the
brilliancy
of
the
night
assisting
him
little
by
little
to
distinguish
the
objects
in
the
cavern
he
discovered
a
huge
beast
lying
within
two
yards
of
him
was
it
a
lion
was
it
a
tiger
was
it
a
crocodile
the
provençal
had
not
enough
education
to
know
to
what
species
his
companion
belonged
but
his
terror
was
the
more
violent
in
that
his
ignorance
led
him
to
imagine
all
sorts
of
calamities
at
once
he
endured
the
fiendish
tortures
of
listening
of
noticing
the
irregularities
of
that
breathing
without
losing
a
sound
and
without
daring
to
make
the
slightest
motion
an
odour
as
pungent
as
that
given
forth
by
foxes
but
more
penetrating
more
weighty
so
to
speak
filled
the
cave
and
when
the
provençal
had
smelled
it
his
terror
reached
its
height
for
he
could
no
longer
doubt
the
nature
of
the
terrible
companion
whose
royal
den
he
had
appropriated
for
a
camp
soon
the
reflection
of
the
moon
which
was
sinking
rapidly
towards
the
horizon
lighted
up
the
den
and
little
by
little
illuminated
the
spotted
skin
of
a
panther
the
lion
of
egypt
was
asleep
curled
up
like
a
huge
dog
in
peaceable
possession
of
a
luxuriant
kennel
at
the
door
of
a
palace
its
eyes
which
had
opened
for
a
moment
had
closed
again
its
head
was
turned
towards
the
frenchman
a
thousand
conflicting
thoughts
passed
through
the
mind
of
the
panther
prisoner
at
first
he
thought
of
killing
her
with
his
carbine
but
he
saw
that
there
was
not
room
enough
between
himself
and
the
beast
for
him
to
take
aim
the
end
of
the
barrel
would
have
reached
beyond
the
panther
and
suppose
she
should
wake
that
supposition
kept
him
perfectly
still
as
he
listened
to
his
heart
beat
in
the
silence
he
cursed
the
too
violent
pulsations
caused
by
the
rushing
of
his
blood
fearing
lest
they
should
disturb
that
slumber
which
enabled
him
to
devise
some
plan
of
escape
twice
he
put
his
hand
to
his
scimitar
with
the
idea
of
cutting
off
his
enemy
head
but
the
difficulty
of
cutting
through
the
skin
made
him
abandon
the
bold
project
if
i
missed
it
would
be
sure
death
he
thought
he
preferred
the
chances
of
a
fight
and
determined
to
wait
for
daylight
and
the
day
was
not
long
in
coming
then
the
frenchman
was
able
to
examine
the
beast
its
muzzle
was
stained
with
blood
it
has
eaten
a
good
meal
thought
he
undisturbed
as
to
whether
the
meal
had
been
of
human
flesh
or
not
it
will
not
be
hungry
when
it
wakes
it
was
a
female
the
hair
on
the
stomach
and
thighs
was
a
dazzling
white
a
number
of
little
spots
like
velvet
formed
dainty
bracelets
around
her
paws
the
muscular
tail
was
white
also
but
ended
in
black
rings
the
upper
part
of
the
coat
yellow
as
unpolished
gold
but
very
smooth
and
soft
bore
the
characteristic
marking
of
spots
which
serve
to
distinguish
panthers
from
other
varieties
of
the
feline
family
that
placid
but
formidable
hostess
lay
snoring
in
an
attitude
as
graceful
as
that
of
a
cat
lying
on
the
cushion
of
an
ottoman
her
paws
muscular
and
provided
with
sharp
claws
were
above
her
head
which
rested
on
them
and
from
her
muzzle
projected
a
few
straight
hairs
called
whiskers
like
silver
thread
if
he
had
seen
her
thus
in
a
cage
the
provençal
would
certainly
have
admired
the
grace
and
the
striking
contrast
of
the
bright
colours
which
gave
to
her
coat
an
imperial
gloss
and
splendour
but
at
that
moment
his
eyes
were
bewildered
by
that
terrible
sight
the
presence
of
the
panther
even
though
asleep
produced
upon
him
the
effect
which
the
magnetic
eyes
are
said
to
produce
upon
the
nightingale
for
a
moment
the
soldier
courage
oozed
away
before
that
danger
whereas
it
would
doubtless
have
been
raised
to
its
highest
pitch
before
the
mouths
of
cannon
vomiting
shot
and
shell
however
a
bold
thought
entered
his
mind
and
froze
at
its
source
the
cold
perspiration
which
stood
on
his
brow
acting
like
those
men
who
driven
to
the
wall
by
misfortune
defy
death
and
offer
themselves
defenceless
to
its
blows
he
detected
in
that
adventure
a
tragedy
which
he
could
not
understand
and
resolved
to
play
his
part
with
honour
to
the
last
the
arabs
might
have
killed
me
day
before
yesterday
he
thought
looking
upon
himself
as
dead
he
waited
with
anxious
curiosity
for
his
enemy
to
wake
when
the
sun
appeared
the
panther
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
then
she
stretched
her
paws
as
if
to
limber
them
and
to
rid
herself
of
the
cramp
finally
she
yawned
showing
her
terrifying
arsenal
of
teeth
and
her
cloven
tongue
hard
as
a
file
she
is
like
a
dainty
woman
thought
the
frenchman
as
he
watched
her
roll
about
and
go
through
the
prettiest
and
most
coquettish
movements
she
licked
off
the
blood
which
stained
her
paws
and
her
nose
and
scratched
her
head
again
and
again
with
the
most
graceful
of
gestures
good
give
a
little
attention
to
your
toilet
said
the
frenchman
to
himself
his
gayety
returning
with
his
courage
in
a
moment
we
will
bid
each
other
good
day
and
he
grasped
the
short
poniard
which
he
had
taken
from
the
maugrabins
at
that
moment
the
panther
turned
her
face
towards
the
frenchman
and
gazed
steadfastly
at
him
without
moving
the
rigidity
of
her
steely
eyes
and
their
unendurable
brilliancy
made
the
provençal
shudder
especially
when
the
beast
walked
towards
him
but
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
caressing
expression
and
smiling
at
her
as
if
to
magnetise
her
allowed
her
to
come
close
to
him
then
with
a
touch
as
gentle
and
loving
as
if
he
were
caressing
the
fairest
of
women
he
passed
his
hand
over
her
whole
body
from
head
to
tail
scratching
with
his
nails
the
flexible
vertebrae
which
formed
the
panther
yellow
back
the
animal
stiffened
her
tail
with
pleasure
her
eyes
became
softer
and
when
the
frenchman
performed
that
caress
for
the
third
time
she
began
to
purr
as
cats
do
to
express
pleasure
but
the
sound
came
forth
from
a
throat
so
deep
and
so
powerful
that
it
rang
through
the
grotto
like
the
last
notes
of
an
organ
through
a
church
the
provençal
realising
the
importance
of
his
caresses
repeated
them
in
a
way
to
soothe
to
lull
the
imperious
courtesan
when
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
allayed
the
ferocity
of
his
capricious
companion
whose
hunger
had
certainly
been
sated
the
night
before
he
rose
and
started
to
leave
the
grotto
the
panther
allowed
him
to
go
but
when
he
had
climbed
the
hill
she
bounded
after
him
as
lightly
as
a
sparrow
hops
from
branch
to
branch
and
rubbed
against
his
legs
curving
her
back
after
the
manner
of
a
cat
then
looking
into
her
guest
face
with
an
eye
whose
glare
had
become
less
deadly
she
uttered
that
wild
cry
which
naturalists
liken
to
the
noise
made
by
a
saw
she
is
very
exacting
exclaimed
the
frenchman
with
a
smile
he
tried
playing
with
her
ears
patting
her
sides
and
scratching
her
head
hard
with
his
nails
and
finding
that
he
was
successful
he
tickled
her
skull
with
the
point
of
his
dagger
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
kill
her
but
the
hardness
of
the
bones
made
him
afraid
that
he
might
not
succeed
the
sultana
of
the
desert
approved
her
slave
talents
by
raising
her
head
stretching
out
her
neck
and
demonstrating
her
delight
by
the
tranquillity
of
her
manner
suddenly
the
frenchman
thought
that
to
murder
with
a
single
blow
that
savage
princess
he
would
have
to
stab
her
in
the
throat
and
he
had
already
raised
his
blade
when
the
panther
satiated
no
doubt
gracefully
lay
down
at
his
feet
casting
on
him
from
time
to
time
glances
in
which
despite
their
natural
savagery
there
was
a
vague
expression
of
kindness
the
poor
provençal
ate
his
dates
leaning
against
one
of
the
but
he
gazed
by
turns
at
the
desert
in
search
of
rescuers
and
at
his
terrible
companion
to
observe
the
progress
of
her
uncertain
kindness
the
panther
watched
the
place
where
the
fell
whenever
he
threw
one
away
and
her
eyes
then
expressed
a
most
extraordinary
degree
of
suspicion
she
examined
the
frenchman
with
the
prudent
scrutiny
of
a
tradesman
but
that
scrutiny
was
evidently
favourable
to
him
for
when
he
had
finished
his
meagre
meal
she
licked
his
shoes
and
with
her
rough
strong
tongue
removed
as
by
a
miracle
the
dust
that
had
become
caked
in
the
creases
of
the
leather
but
what
will
happen
when
she
is
hungry
thought
the
provençal
despite
the
shudder
caused
by
that
idea
the
soldier
began
to
observe
with
a
curious
ardour
the
proportions
of
the
panther
certainly
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
species
for
she
was
three
feet
in
height
and
four
feet
long
not
including
the
tail
that
powerful
weapon
as
round
as
a
club
measured
nearly
three
feet
the
face
which
was
as
large
as
a
lioness
was
distinguished
by
an
expression
of
extraordinary
shrewdness
the
unfeeling
cruelty
of
the
tiger
was
predominant
therein
but
there
was
also
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
face
of
an
artful
woman
at
that
moment
that
solitary
queen
features
disclosed
a
sort
of
merriment
like
that
of
nero
in
his
cups
she
had
quenched
her
thirst
in
blood
and
was
inclined
to
play
the
soldier
tried
to
come
and
go
the
panther
allowed
him
to
do
as
he
pleased
contenting
herself
with
following
him
with
her
eyes
resembling
not
so
much
a
faithful
dog
as
a
great
angora
cat
distrustful
of
everything
even
her
master
movements
when
he
turned
he
saw
beside
the
spring
the
remains
of
his
horse
the
panther
had
brought
the
body
all
that
distance
about
of
it
were
consumed
that
spectacle
encouraged
the
frenchman
it
was
easy
then
for
him
to
explain
the
panther
absence
and
the
forbearance
with
which
she
had
treated
him
during
his
sleep
emboldened
by
his
good
fortune
to
tempt
the
future
he
conceived
the
wild
hope
of
living
on
good
terms
with
the
panther
from
day
to
day
neglecting
no
method
of
taming
her
and
of
winning
her
good
graces
he
returned
to
her
side
and
had
the
indescribable
joy
of
seeing
her
move
her
tail
with
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
thereupon
he
sat
down
fearlessly
beside
her
and
they
began
to
play
together
he
patted
her
paws
and
her
nose
twisted
her
ears
threw
her
over
on
her
back
and
scratched
roughly
her
soft
warm
flanks
she
made
no
objection
and
when
the
soldier
attempted
to
smooth
the
hair
on
her
paws
she
carefully
withdrew
her
nails
which
were
curved
like
damascus
blades
the
frenchman
who
had
one
hand
on
his
dagger
was
still
thinking
of
thrusting
it
into
the
side
of
the
too
trustful
panther
but
he
was
afraid
of
being
strangled
in
her
last
convulsions
moreover
he
had
in
his
heart
a
sort
of
remorse
enjoining
upon
him
to
respect
a
harmless
creature
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
found
a
friend
in
that
boundless
desert
involuntarily
he
thought
of
his
first
sweetheart
whom
he
had
nicknamed
mignonne
by
antiphrasis
because
she
was
so
fiendishly
jealous
that
throughout
all
the
time
that
their
intercourse
lasted
he
had
to
be
on
his
guard
against
the
knife
with
which
she
constantly
threatened
him
that
memory
of
his
youth
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
trying
to
make
the
young
panther
answer
to
that
name
he
admired
her
agility
her
grace
and
her
gentleness
with
less
terror
now
towards
the
close
of
the
day
he
had
become
accustomed
to
his
hazardous
situation
and
he
was
almost
in
love
with
its
dangers
his
companion
had
finally
caught
the
habit
of
turning
to
him
when
he
called
in
a
falsetto
voice
mignonne
at
sunset
mignonne
repeated
several
times
a
deep
and
melancholy
cry
she
has
been
well
brought
up
thought
the
soldier
she
is
saying
her
prayers
but
that
unspoken
jest
only
came
into
his
mind
when
he
noticed
the
peaceful
attitude
which
his
companion
maintained
come
my
pretty
blonde
i
will
let
you
go
to
bed
first
he
said
relying
upon
the
agility
of
his
legs
to
escape
as
soon
as
she
slept
and
trusting
to
find
another
for
the
night
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
right
moment
for
his
flight
and
when
it
came
he
walked
rapidly
towards
the
nile
but
he
had
travelled
barely
a
quarter
of
a
league
through
the
sand
when
he
heard
the
panther
bounding
after
him
and
uttering
at
intervals
that
sawlike
cry
which
was
even
more
alarming
than
the
heavy
thud
of
her
bounds
well
well
he
said
she
has
really
taken
a
fancy
to
me
it
may
be
that
this
young
panther
has
never
met
a
man
before
it
is
flattering
to
possess
her
first
love
at
that
moment
he
stepped
into
one
of
those
quicksands
which
are
so
perilous
to
travellers
and
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
extricate
one
self
feeling
that
he
was
caught
he
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
the
panther
seized
him
by
the
collar
with
her
teeth
and
with
a
powerful
backward
leap
rescued
him
from
death
as
if
by
magic
ah
cried
the
soldier
caressing
her
enthusiastically
it
a
matter
of
life
or
death
between
us
now
mignonne
but
no
tricks
then
he
retraced
his
steps
from
that
moment
the
desert
was
as
it
were
peopled
for
him
it
contained
a
living
creature
to
whom
the
frenchman
could
talk
and
whose
ferocity
was
moderated
for
him
without
any
comprehension
on
his
part
of
the
reasons
for
that
extraordinary
friendship
however
desirous
the
soldier
was
to
remain
up
and
on
his
guard
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
saw
nothing
of
mignonne
he
ascended
the
hill
and
saw
her
in
the
far
distance
bounding
along
according
to
the
custom
of
these
animals
which
are
prevented
from
running
by
the
extreme
flexibility
of
their
spinal
column
mignonne
arrived
with
bloody
chops
she
received
her
companion
proffered
caresses
manifesting
her
delight
by
reiterated
and
deep
purrs
her
eyes
full
of
languor
rested
with
even
more
mildness
than
before
on
the
provençal
who
spoke
to
her
as
to
a
domestic
animal
aha
mademoiselle
for
you
are
a
good
girl
are
you
upon
my
word
how
we
like
to
be
patted
are
you
ashamed
have
you
been
eating
up
some
arab
never
mind
they
animals
like
yourself
but
do
go
eating
frenchmen
at
all
events
if
you
do
i
shall
not
love
you
any
more
she
played
as
a
huge
puppy
plays
with
its
master
allowing
him
to
roll
her
over
and
pat
her
by
turns
and
sometimes
she
challenged
him
by
putting
her
paw
upon
him
with
an
appealing
gesture
several
days
passed
thus
that
companionship
enabled
the
provençal
to
admire
the
sublime
beauties
of
the
desert
from
the
moment
that
he
found
there
moments
of
dread
and
of
security
food
to
eat
and
a
creature
of
whom
he
could
think
his
mind
was
excited
by
contrasts
it
was
a
life
full
of
opposing
sensations
solitude
made
manifest
all
its
secrets
to
him
enveloped
him
in
all
its
charm
he
discovered
spectacles
unknown
to
the
world
in
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
he
started
when
he
heard
above
his
head
the
soft
whirring
of
the
wings
of
a
bird
rare
visitant
or
when
he
watched
the
clouds
melt
together
voyagers
during
the
night
he
studied
the
effects
of
the
moon
on
the
ocean
of
sand
where
the
simoom
produced
waves
and
undulations
and
swift
changes
he
lived
in
the
gorgeous
light
of
the
orient
he
admired
its
wonderful
splendours
and
often
after
enjoying
the
awful
spectacle
of
a
storm
on
that
plain
where
the
sand
rose
in
a
dry
red
mist
in
clouds
he
rejoiced
at
the
approach
of
night
for
then
the
delicious
coolness
of
the
stars
fell
upon
the
earth
he
listened
to
imaginary
music
in
the
skies
solitude
taught
him
too
to
seek
the
treasures
of
reverie
he
passed
whole
hours
recalling
trifles
comparing
his
past
life
with
his
present
one
lastly
he
conceived
a
warm
regard
for
his
panther
for
affection
was
a
necessity
to
him
whether
it
was
that
his
will
magnetically
strong
had
changed
his
companion
disposition
or
that
she
found
abundant
food
because
of
the
constant
battles
which
were
taking
place
in
those
deserts
she
spared
the
frenchman
life
and
he
finally
ceased
to
distrust
her
when
he
found
that
she
had
become
so
tame
he
employed
most
of
his
time
in
sleeping
but
he
was
obliged
to
watch
at
times
like
a
spider
in
the
midst
of
its
web
in
order
not
to
allow
the
moment
of
his
deliverance
to
escape
if
any
human
being
should
pass
through
the
circle
described
by
the
horizon
he
had
sacrificed
his
shirt
to
make
a
flag
which
he
had
hoisted
to
the
top
of
a
leafless
advised
by
necessity
he
invented
a
way
to
keep
it
unfolded
by
the
use
of
sticks
for
the
wind
might
not
have
stirred
it
at
the
moment
when
the
expected
traveller
should
look
across
the
desert
but
it
was
during
the
long
hours
when
hope
abandoned
him
that
he
played
with
the
panther
he
had
ended
by
learning
the
different
inflections
of
her
voice
the
different
expressions
of
her
eyes
he
had
studied
all
the
gradations
of
colour
of
her
golden
coat
mignonne
no
longer
even
growled
when
he
seized
the
tuft
of
hair
at
the
end
of
her
redoubtable
tail
to
count
the
black
and
white
rings
a
graceful
ornament
which
shone
in
the
sunlight
like
precious
stones
he
took
pleasure
in
gazing
at
the
graceful
and
voluptuous
lines
of
her
figure
and
the
whiteness
of
her
stomach
as
well
as
the
shapeliness
of
her
head
but
it
was
especially
when
she
was
playing
that
he
delighted
in
watching
her
and
the
youthful
agility
of
her
movements
always
surprised
him
he
admired
her
suppleness
when
she
bounded
crept
glided
crouched
clung
rolled
over
and
over
darted
hither
and
thither
however
swift
her
bound
however
slippery
the
bowlder
she
always
stopped
short
at
the
word
mignonne
one
day
in
the
dazzling
sunlight
an
enormous
bird
hovered
in
the
sky
the
provençal
left
his
panther
to
scrutinise
that
new
guest
but
after
waiting
a
moment
his
neglected
sultana
uttered
a
low
growl
god
forgive
me
i
believe
that
she
is
jealous
he
cried
seeing
that
her
eyes
had
become
steely
once
more
surely
virginie
soul
has
passed
into
that
body
the
eagle
disappeared
while
the
soldier
was
admiring
the
rounded
flank
there
was
so
much
youthful
grace
in
her
outlines
she
was
as
pretty
as
a
woman
the
light
fur
of
her
coat
blended
by
delicate
shades
with
the
of
her
thighs
the
vivid
sunshine
caused
that
living
gold
those
brown
spots
to
gleam
in
such
wise
as
to
make
them
indescribably
charming
the
provençal
and
his
panther
gazed
at
each
other
with
an
air
of
comprehension
the
coquette
started
when
she
felt
her
friend
nails
scratching
her
head
her
eyes
shone
like
flashes
of
lightning
then
she
closed
them
tight
she
has
a
soul
he
cried
as
he
studied
the
tranquil
repose
of
that
queen
of
the
sands
white
as
their
pulsing
light
solitary
and
burning
as
they
well
she
said
to
me
i
have
read
your
argument
in
favour
of
wild
beasts
but
how
did
two
persons
so
well
fitted
to
understand
each
other
finally
come
out
ah
there
you
are
it
ended
as
all
great
passions
do
by
a
misunderstanding
each
believes
in
some
treachery
one
refrains
from
explaining
from
pride
the
other
quarrels
from
obstinacy
and
sometimes
at
the
happiest
moment
she
said
a
glance
an
exclamation
is
enough
well
finish
your
story
it
is
very
difficult
but
you
will
understand
what
the
old
veteran
had
already
confided
to
me
when
as
he
finished
his
bottle
of
champagne
he
exclaimed
do
know
how
i
hurt
her
but
she
turned
as
if
she
had
gone
mad
and
wounded
my
thigh
with
her
sharp
teeth
a
slight
wound
i
thinking
that
she
meant
to
devour
me
plunged
my
dagger
into
her
throat
she
rolled
over
with
a
cry
which
tore
my
soul
i
saw
her
struggle
gazing
at
me
without
a
trace
of
anger
i
would
have
given
anything
in
the
world
even
my
cross
which
i
had
not
then
earned
to
restore
her
to
life
again
it
was
as
if
i
had
murdered
a
human
being
and
the
soldiers
who
had
seen
my
flag
and
who
hurried
to
my
rescue
found
me
weeping
well
monsieur
he
continued
after
a
moment
silence
then
i
have
fought
in
germany
spain
russia
and
france
i
have
marched
my
poor
old
bones
about
but
i
have
seen
nothing
comparable
to
the
desert
ah
that
is
magnificent
i
tell
you
were
your
feelings
there
i
asked
they
can
not
be
told
young
man
besides
i
do
not
always
regret
my
panther
and
my
oasis
i
must
be
very
sad
for
that
but
i
will
tell
you
this
in
the
desert
there
is
all
and
yet
nothing
explain
that
then
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
is
there
and
man
is
not
