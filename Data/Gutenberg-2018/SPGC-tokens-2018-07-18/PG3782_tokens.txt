this
simple

may
give
him
an
hour
of
entertainment
i
offer
it
to
you
because
i
think
you
have
met
my
friend
dickson
mccunn
and
i
dare
to
hope
that
you
may
even
in
your
many
sojournings
in
the
westlands
have
encountered
one
or
other
of
the
gorbals
if
you
share
my
kindly
feeling
for
dickson
you
will
be
interested
in
some
facts
which
i
have
lately
ascertained
about
his
ancestry
in
his
veins
there
flows
a
portion
of
the
redoubtable
blood
of
the
nicol
jarvies
when
the
bailie
you
remember
returned
from
his
journey
to
rob
roy
beyond
the
highland
line
he
espoused
his
housekeeper
mattie
an
honest
man
daughter
and
a
near
cousin
o
the
laird
limmerfield
the
union
was
blessed
with
a
son
who
succeeded
to
the
bailie
business
and
in
due
course
begat
daughters
one
of
whom
married
a
certain
ebenezer
mccunn
of
whom
there
is
record
in
the
archives
of
the
hammermen
of
glasgow
ebenezer
grandson
peter
by
name
was
provost
of
kirkintilloch
and
his
second

of

by
his

with

of

robert

there
are
coloured
threads
in

prologue
the
girl
came
into
the
room
with
a
darting
movement
like
a
swallow
looked
round
her
with
the
same
birdlike
quickness
and
then
ran
across
the
polished
floor
to
where
a
young
man
sat
on
a
sofa
with
one
leg
laid
along
it
i
have
saved
you
this
dance
quentin
she
said
pronouncing
the
name
with
a
pretty
staccato
you
must
be
so
lonely
not
dancing
so
i
will
sit
with
you
what
shall
we
talk
about
the
young
man
did
not
answer
at
once
for
his
gaze
was
held
by
her
face
he
had
never
dreamed
that
the
gawky
and
rather
plain
little
girl
whom
he
had
romped
with
long
ago
in
paris
would
grow
into
such
a
being
the
clean
delicate
lines
of
her
figure
the
exquisite
pure
colouring
of
hair
and
skin
the
charming
young
arrogance
of
the
eyes
this
was
beauty
he
reflected
a
miracle
a
revelation
her
virginal
fineness
and
her
dress
which
was
the
tint
of
pale
fire
gave
her
the
air
of
a
creature
of
ice
and
flame
about
yourself
please
saskia
he
said
are
you
happy
now
that
you
are
a
lady
happy
her
voice
had
a
thrill
in
it
like
music
frosty
music
the
days
are
far
too
short
i
grudge
the
hours
when
i
must
sleep
they
say
it
is
sad
for
me
to
make
my
d√©but
in
a
time
of
war
but
the
world
is
very
kind
to
me
and
after
all
it
is
a
victorious
war
for
our
russia
and
listen
to
this
quentin
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
begin
nursing
at
the
alexander
hospital
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
time
was
january
and
the
place
a
room
in
the
great
nirski
palace
no
hint
of
war
no
breath
from
the
snowy
streets
entered
that
curious
chamber
where
prince
peter
nirski
kept
some
of
the
chief
of
his
famous
treasures
it
was
notable
for
its
lack
of
drapery
and
upholstering
only
a
sofa
or
two
and
a
few
fine
rugs
on
the
cedar
floor
the
walls
were
of
a
green
marble
veined
like
malachite
the
ceiling
was
of
darker
marble
inlaid
with
white
intaglios
scattered
everywhere
were
tables
and
cabinets
laden
with
celadon
china
and
carved
jade
and
ivories
and
shimmering
persian
and
rhodian
vessels
in
all
the
room
there
was
scarcely
anything
of
metal
and
no
touch
of
gilding
or
bright
colour
the
light
came
from
green
alabaster
censers
and
the
place
swam
in
a
cold
green
radiance
like
some
cavern
below
the
sea
the
air
was
warm
and
scented
and
though
it
was
very
quiet
there
a
hum
of
voices
and
the
strains
of
dance
music
drifted
to
it
from
the
pillared
corridor
in
which
could
be
seen
the
glare
of
lights
from
the
great
ballroom
beyond
the
young
man
had
a
thin
face
with
lines
of
suffering
round
the
mouth
and
eyes
the
warm
room
had
given
him
a
high
colour
which
increased
his
air
of
fragility
he
felt
a
little
choked
by
the
place
which
seemed
to
him
for
both
body
and
mind
a
though
he
knew
very
well
that
the
nirski
palace
on
this
gala
evening
was
in
no
way
typical
of
the
land
or
its
masters
only
a
week
ago
he
had
been
eating
black
bread
with
its
owner
in
a
hut
on
the
volhynian
front
you
have
become
amazing
saskia
he
said
i
wo
pay
my
old
playfellow
compliments
besides
you
must
be
tired
of
them
i
wish
you
happiness
all
the
day
long
like
a
princess
but
a
crock
like
me
ca
do
much
to
help
you
to
it
the
service
seems
to
be
the
wrong
way
round
for
here
you
are
wasting
your
time
talking
to
me
she
put
her
hand
on
his
poor
quentin
is
the
leg
very
bad
he
laughed
oh
no
it
mending
famously
i
be
able
to
get
about
without
a
stick
in
another
month
and
then
you
got
to
teach
me
all
the
new
dances
the
jigging
music
of
a
floated
down
the
corridor
it
made
the
young
man
brow
contract
for
it
brought
to
him
a
vision
of
dead
faces
in
the
gloom
of
a
november
dusk
he
had
once
had
a
friend
who
used
to
whistle
that
air
and
he
had
seen
him
die
in
the
hollebeke
mud
there
was
something
in
the
tune
he
was
surely
morbid
this
evening
for
there
seemed
something
about
the
house
the
room
the
dancing
all
russia
these
last
days
he
had
suffered
from
a
sense
of
calamity
impending
of
a
dark
curtain
drawing
down
upon
a
splendid
world
they
did
agree
with
him
at
the
embassy
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
the
girl
saw
his
sudden
abstraction
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
asked
it
had
been
her
favourite
question
as
a
child
i
was
thinking
that
i
rather
wished
you
were
still
in
paris
but
why
because
i
think
you
would
be
safer
oh
what
nonsense
quentin
dear
where
should
i
be
safe
if
not
in
my
own
russia
where
i
have
friends
oh
so
many
and
tribes
and
tribes
of
relations
it
is
france
and
england
that
are
unsafe
with
the
german
guns
grumbling
at
their
doors
my
complaint
is
that
my
life
is
too
cosseted
and
padded
i
am
too
secure
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
secure
the
young
man
lifted
a
heavy
casket
from
a
table
at
his
elbow
it
was
of
dark
green
imperial
jade
with
a
wonderfully
carved
lid
he
took
off
the
lid
and
picked
up
three
small
oddments
of
ivory
a
priest
with
a
beard
a
tiny
soldier
and
a
putting
the
three
in
a
triangle
he
balanced
the
jade
box
on
them
look
saskia
if
you
were
living
inside
that
box
you
would
think
it
very
secure
you
would
note
the
thickness
of
the
walls
and
the
hardness
of
the
stone
and
you
would
dream
away
in
a
peaceful
green
dusk
but
all
the
time
it
would
be
held
up
by
trifles
brittle
trifles
she
shook
her
head
you
do
not
understand
you
can
not
understand
we
are
a
very
old
and
strong
people
with
roots
deep
deep
in
the
earth
please
god
you
are
right
he
said
but
saskia
you
know
that
if
i
can
ever
serve
you
you
have
only
to
command
me
now
i
can
do
no
more
for
you
than
the
mouse
for
the
lion
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
but
the
story
had
an
end
you
remember
and
some
day
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
help
you
promise
to
send
for
me
the
girl
laughed
merrily
the
king
of
spain
daughter
she
quoted
came
to
visit
me
and
all
for
the
love
of
my
little
the
other
laughed
also
as
a
young
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
preobrajenski
guard
approached
to
claim
the
girl
even
a
may
be
a
shelter
in
a
storm
he
said
of
course
i
promise
quentin
she
said
soon
i
will
come
and
take
you
to
supper
and
we
will
talk
of
nothing
but
he
watched
the
two
leave
the
room
her
gown
glowing
like
a
tongue
of
fire
in
the
shadowy
archway
then
he
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
for
he
thought
that
for
a
little
he
would
watch
the
dancing
something
moved
beside
him
and
he
turned
in
time
to
prevent
the
jade
casket
from
crashing
to
the
floor
two
of
the
supports
had
slipped
he
replaced
the
thing
on
its
proper
table
and
stood
silent
for
a
moment
the
priest
and
the
soldier
gone
and
only
the
beast
of
burden
left
if
i
were
inclined
to
be

dickson
mccunn
completed
the
polishing
of
his
smooth
cheeks
with
the
towel
glanced
appreciatively
at
their
reflection
in
the
and
then
permitted
his
eyes
to
stray
out
of
the
window
in
the
little
garden
lilacs
were
budding
and
there
was
a
gold
line
of
daffodils
beside
the
tiny
greenhouse
beyond
the
sooty
wall
a
birch
flaunted
its
new
tassels
and
the
jackdaws
were
circling
about
the
steeple
of
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
a
blackbird
whistled
from
a
and
mccunn
was
inspired
to
follow
its
example
he
began
a
tolerable
version
of
roy
wife
of
aldivalloch
he
felt
singularly
and
the
immediate
cause
was
his
safety
razor
a
week
ago
he
had
bought
the
thing
in
a
sudden
fit
of
enterprise
and
now
he
shaved
in
five
minutes
where
before
he
had
taken
twenty
and
no
longer
confronted
his
fellows
at
least
one
day
in
three
with
a
countenance
ludicrously
mottled
by
calculation
revealed
to
him
the
fact
that
in
his
years
having
begun
to
shave
at
eighteen
he
had
wasted
three
thousand
three
hundred
and
seventy
hours
or
one
hundred
and
forty
days
or
between
four
and
five
months
by
his
neglect
of
this
admirable
invention
now
he
felt
that
he
had
stolen
a
march
on
time
he
had
fallen
heir
thus
late
to
a
fortune
in
unpurchasable
leisure
he
began
to
dress
himself
in
the
sombre
clothes
in
which
he
had
been
accustomed
for
years
and
more
to
go
down
to
the
shop
in
mearns
street
and
then
a
thought
came
to
him
which
made
him
discard
the
trousers
sit
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
muse
since
saturday
the
shop
was
a
thing
of
the
past
on
saturday
at
eleven
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
glass
of
dubious
sherry
he
had
completed
the
arrangements
by
which
the
provision
shop
in
mearns
street
which
had
borne
so
long
the
legend
of
mccunn
together
with
the
branches
in
crossmyloof
and
the
shaws
became
the
property
of
a
company
yclept
the
united
supply
stores
limited
he
had
received
in
payment
cash
debentures
and
preference
shares
and
his
lawyers
and
his
own
acumen
had
acclaimed
the
bargain
but
all
the
he
had
been
a
little
sad
it
was
the
end
of
so
old
a
song
and
he
knew
no
other
tune
to
sing
he
was
comfortably
off
healthy
free
from
any
particular
cares
in
life
but
free
too
from
any
particular
duties
will
i
be
going
to
turn
into
a
useless
old
man
he
asked
himself
but
he
had
woke
up
this
monday
to
the
sound
of
the
blackbird
and
the
world
which
had
seemed
rather
empty
twelve
hours
before
was
now
brisk
and
alluring
his
prowess
in
quick
shaving
assured
him
of
his
youth
i
no
that
dead
old
he
observed
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
to
his
reflection
in
the
big
it
was
not
an
old
face
the
sandy
hair
was
a
little
thin
on
the
top
and
a
little
grey
at
the
temples
the
figure
was
perhaps
a
little
too
full
for
youthful
elegance
and
an
athlete
would
have
censured
the
neck
as
too
fleshy
for
perfect
health
but
the
cheeks
were
rosy
the
skin
clear
and
the
pale
eyes
singularly
childlike
they
were
a
little
weak
those
eyes
and
had
some
difficulty
in
looking
for
long
at
the
same
object
so
that
mccunn
did
not
stare
people
in
the
face
and
had
in
consequence
at
one
time
in
his
career
acquired
a
perfectly
undeserved
reputation
for
cunning
he
shaved
clean
and
looked
uncommonly
like
a
wise
plump
schoolboy
as
he
gazed
at
his
simulacrum
he
stopped
whistling
roy
wife
and
let
his
countenance
harden
into
a
noble
sternness
then
he
laughed
and
observed
in
the
language
of
his
youth
that
there
was
life
in
the
auld
dowg
yet
in
that
moment
the
soul
of
mccunn
conceived
the
great
plan
the
first
sign
of
it
was
that
he
swept
all
his
business
garments
unceremoniously
on
to
the
floor
the
next
that
he
rootled
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
drawer
and
extracted
a
most
disreputable
tweed
suit
it
had
once
been
what
i
believe
is
called
a
lovat
mixture
but
was
now
a
nondescript
with
bright
patches
of
colour
like
moss
on
whinstone
he
regarded
it
lovingly
for
it
had
been
for
twenty
years
his
holiday
wear
emerging
annually
for
a
hallowed
month
to
be
stained
with
salt
and
bleached
with
sun
he
put
it
on
and
stood
shrouded
in
an
odour
of
camphor
a
pair
of
thick
nailed
boots
and
a
flannel
shirt
and
collar
completed
the
equipment
of
the
sportsman
he
had
another
long
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
then
descended
whistling
to
breakfast
this
time
the
tune
was
macgregor
gathering
and
the
sound
of
it
stirred
the
grimy
lips
of
a
man
outside
who
was
delivering
coals
himself
a
macgregor
to
follow
suit
mccunn
was
a
very
fountain
of
music
that
morning
tibby
the
aged
maid
had
his
newspaper
and
letters
waiting
by
his
plate
and
a
dish
of
ham
and
eggs
frizzling
near
the
fire
he
fell
to
ravenously
but
still
musingly
and
he
had
reached
the
stage
of
scones
and
jam
before
he
glanced
at
his
correspondence
there
was
a
letter
from
his
wife
now
holidaying
at
the
neuk
hydropathic
she
reported
that
her
health
was
improving
and
that
she
had
met
various
people
who
had
known
somebody
who
had
known
somebody
else
whom
she
had
once
known
herself
mccunn
read
the
dutiful
pages
and
smiled
mamma
enjoying
herself
fine
he
observed
to
the
teapot
he
knew
that
for
his
wife
the
earthly
paradise
was
a
hydropathic
where
she
put
on
her
afternoon
dress
and
every
jewel
she
possessed
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
ate
large
meals
of
which
the
novelty
atoned
for
the
nastiness
and
collected
an
immense
casual
acquaintance
with
whom
she
discussed
ailments
ministers
sudden
deaths
and
the
intricate
genealogies
of
her
class
for
his
part
he
rancorously
hated
hydropathics
having
once
spent
a
black
week
under
the
roof
of
one
in
his
wife
company
he
detested
the
food
the
turkish
baths
he
had
a
passionate
aversion
to
baring
his
body
before
strangers
the
inability
to
find
anything
to
do
and
the
compulsion
to
endless
small
talk
a
thought
flitted
over
his
mind
which
he
was
too
loyal
to
formulate
once
he
and
his
wife
had
had
similar
likings
but
they
had
taken
different
roads
since
their
child
died
janet
he
saw
again
he
was
never
quite
free
from
the
sight
the
solemn
little
girl
who
had
died
long
ago
in
the
spring
it
may
have
been
the
thought
of
the
neuk
hydropathic
or
more
likely
the
thin
clean
scent
of
the
daffodils
with
which
tibby
had
decked
the
table
but
long
ere
breakfast
was
finished
the
great
plan
had
ceased
to
be
an
airy
vision
and
become
a
sober
structure
mccunn
i
may
confess
it
at
the
start
was
an
incurable
romantic
he
had
had
a
humdrum
life
since
the
day
when
he
had
first
entered
his
uncle
shop
with
the
hope
of
some
day
succeeding
that
honest
grocer
and
his
feet
had
never
strayed
a
yard
from
his
sober
rut
but
his
mind
like
the
dying
gladiator
had
been
far
away
as
a
boy
he
had
voyaged
among
books
and
they
had
given
him
a
world
where
he
could
shape
his
career
according
to
his
whimsical
fancy
not
that
mccunn
was
what
is
known
as
a
great
reader
he
read
slowly
and
fastidiously
and
sought
in
literature
for
one
thing
alone
sir
walter
scott
had
been
his
first
guide
but
he
read
the
novels
not
for
their
insight
into
human
character
or
for
their
historical
pageantry
but
because
they
gave
him
material
wherewith
to
construct
fantastic
journeys
it
was
the
same
with
dickens
a
lit
tavern
a
the
clack
of
hoofs
on
a
frosty
road
went
to
his
head
like
wine
he
was
a
jacobite
not
because
he
had
any
views
on
divine
right
but
because
he
had
always
before
his
eyes
a
picture
of
a
knot
of
adventurers
in
cloaks
new
landed
from
france
among
the
western
heather
on
this
select
basis
he
had
built
up
his
small
library
defoe
hakluyt
hazlitt
and
the
essayists
boswell
some
indifferent
romances
and
a
shelf
of
spirited
poetry
his
tastes
became
known
and
he
acquired
a
reputation
for
a
scholarly
habit
he
was
president
of
the
literary
society
of
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
and
read
to
its
members
a
variety
of
papers
full
of
a
gusto
which
rarely
became
critical
he
had
been
three
times
chairman
at
burns
anniversary
dinners
and
had
delivered
orations
in
eulogy
of
the
national
bard
not
because
he
greatly
admired
him
he
thought
him
rather
vulgar
but
because
he
took
burns
as
an
emblem
of
the
literature
which
he
loved
mccunn
was
no
scholar
and
was
sublimely
unconscious
of
background
he
grew
his
flowers
in
his
small
oblivious
of
their
origin
so
long
as
they
gave
him
the
colour
and
scent
he
sought
scent
i
say
for
he
appreciated
more
than
the
mere
picturesque
he
had
a
passion
for
words
and
cadences
and
would
be
haunted
for
weeks
by
a
cunning
phrase
savouring
it
as
a
connoisseur
savours
a
vintage
wherefore
long
ago
when
he
could
ill
afford
it
he
had
purchased
the
edinburgh
they
were
the
only
large
books
on
his
shelves
for
he
had
a
liking
for
small
volumes
things
he
could
stuff
into
his
pocket
in
that
sudden
journey
which
he
loved
to
contemplate
only
he
had
never
taken
it
the
shop
had
tied
him
up
for
eleven
months
in
the
year
and
the
twelfth
had
always
found
him
settled
decorously
with
his
wife
in
some
seaside
villa
he
had
not
fretted
for
he
was
content
with
dreams
he
was
always
a
little
tired
too
when
the
holidays
came
and
his
wife
told
him
he
was
growing
old
he
consoled
himself
with
tags
from
the
more
philosophic
of
his
authors
but
he
scarcely
needed
consolation
for
he
had
large
stores
of
modest
contentment
but
now
something
had
happened
a
spring
morning
and
a
safety
razor
had
convinced
him
that
he
was
still
young
since
yesterday
he
was
a
man
of
a
large
leisure
providence
had
done
for
him
what
he
would
never
have
done
for
himself
the
rut
in
which
he
had
travelled
so
long
had
given
place
to
open
country
he
repeated
to
himself
one
of
the
quotations
with
which
he
had
been
wont
to
stir
the
literary
young
men
at
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
what
a
man
age
he
must
hurry
more
that
all
cram
in
a
day
what
his
youth
took
a
year
to
hold
when
we
mind
labour
then
only
we
too
old
what
age
had
methusalem
when
he
begat
saul
he
would
go
journeying
who
but
he
pleasantly
it
sounds
a
trivial
resolve
but
it
quickened
mccunn
to
the
depths
of
his
being
a
holiday
and
alone
on
foot
of
course
for
he
must
travel
light
he
would
buckle
on
a
pack
after
the
approved
fashion
he
had
the
very
thing
in
a
drawer
upstairs
which
he
had
bought
some
years
ago
at
a
sale
that
and
a
waterproof
and
a
stick
and
his
outfit
was
complete
a
book
too
and
as
he
lit
his
first
pipe
he
considered
what
it
should
be
poetry
clearly
for
it
was
the
spring
and
besides
poetry
could
be
got
in
pleasantly
small
bulk
he
stood
before
his
bookshelves
trying
to
select
a
volume
rejecting
one
after
another
as
inapposite
browning
keats
shelley
they
seemed
more
suited
for
the
hearth
than
for
the
roadside
he
did
not
want
anything
scots
for
he
was
of
opinion
that
spring
came
more
richly
in
england
and
that
english
people
had
a
better
notion
of
it
he
was
tempted
by
the
oxford
anthology
but
was
deterred
by
its
thickness
for
he
did
not
possess
the
edition
finally
he
selected
izaak
walton
he
had
never
fished
in
his
life
but
compleat
seemed
to
fit
his
mood
it
was
old
and
curious
and
learned
and
fragrant
with
the
youth
of
things
he
remembered
its
falling
cadences
its
country
songs
and
wise
meditations
decidedly
it
was
the
right
scrip
for
his
pilgrimage
characteristically
he
thought
last
of
where
he
was
to
go
every
bit
of
the
world
beyond
his
front
door
had
its
charms
to
the
seeing
eye
there
seemed
nothing
common
or
unclean
that
fresh
morning
even
a
walk
among
had
its
attractions
but
since
he
had
the
right
to
choose
he
lingered
over
it
like
an
epicure
not
the
highlands
for
spring
came
late
among
their
sour
mosses
some
place
where
there
were
fields
and
woods
and
inns
somewhere
too
within
call
of
the
sea
it
must
not
be
too
remote
for
he
had
no
time
to
waste
on
train
journeys
nor
too
near
for
he
wanted
a
countryside
untainted
presently
he
thought
of
carrick
a
good
green
land
as
he
remembered
it
with
purposeful
white
roads
and
sacred
to
the
memory
of
burns
near
the
hills
but
yet
lowland
and
with
a
bright
sea
chafing
on
its
shores
he
decided
on
carrick
found
a
map
and
planned
his
journey
then
he
routed
out
his
knapsack
packed
it
with
a
modest
change
of
raiment
and
sent
out
tibby
to
buy
chocolate
and
tobacco
and
to
cash
a
cheque
at
the
strathclyde
bank
till
tibby
returned
he
occupied
himself
with
delicious
dreams
he
saw
himself
daily
growing
browner
and
leaner
swinging
along
broad
highways
or
wandering
in
bypaths
he
pictured
his
seasons
of
ease
when
he
unslung
his
pack
and
smoked
in
some
clump
of
lilacs
by
a
burnside
he
remembered
a
phrase
of
stevenson
somewhat
like
that
he
would
meet
and
talk
with
all
sorts
of
folk
an
exhilarating
prospect
for
mccunn
loved
his
kind
there
would
be
the
evening
hour
before
he
reached
his
inn
when
pleasantly
tired
he
would
top
some
ridge
and
see
the
welcoming
lights
of
a
little
town
there
would
be
the
time
when
he
would
read
and
reflect
and
the
start
in
the
gay
morning
when
tobacco
tastes
sweetest
and
even
seems
young
it
would
be
holiday
of
the
purest
for
no
business
now
tugged
at
his
he
was
beginning
a
new
life
he
told
himself
when
he
could
cultivate
the
seedling
interests
which
had
withered
beneath
the
shade
of
the
shop
was
ever
a
man
more
fortunate
or
more
free
tibby
was
told
that
he
was
going
off
for
a
week
or
two
no
letters
need
be
forwarded
for
he
would
be
constantly
moving
but
mccunn
at
the
neuk
hydropathic
would
be
kept
informed
of
his
whereabouts
presently
he
stood
on
his
doorstep
a
stocky
figure
in
ancient
tweeds
with
a
bulging
pack
slung
on
his
arm
and
a
stout
hazel
stick
in
his
hand
a
would
have
remarked
an
elderly
shopkeeper
bent
apparently
on
a
day
in
the
country
a
common
little
man
on
a
prosaic
errand
but
the
would
have
been
wrong
for
he
could
not
see
into
the
heart
the
plump
citizen
was
the
eternal
pilgrim
he
was
jason
ulysses
eric
the
red
albuquerque
cortez
starting
out
to
discover
new
worlds
before
he
left
mccunn
had
given
tibby
a
letter
to
post
that
morning
he
had
received
an
epistle
from
a
benevolent
acquaintance
one
mackintosh
regarding
a
group
of
urchins
who
called
themselves
the
gorbals
behind
the
premises
in
mearns
street
lay
a
tract
of
slums
full
of
mischievous
boys
with
whom
his
staff
waged
truceless
war
but
lately
there
had
started
among
them
a
kind
of
unauthorised
and
unofficial
boy
scouts
who
without
uniform
or
badge
or
any
kind
of
paraphernalia
followed
the
banner
of
sir
robert
and
subjected
themselves
to
a
rude
discipline
they
were
far
too
poor
to
join
an
orthodox
troop
but
they
faithfully
copied
what
they
believed
to
be
the
practices
of
more
fortunate
boys
mccunn
had
witnessed
their
pathetic
parades
and
had
even
passed
the
time
of
day
with
their
leader
a
savage
called
dougal
the
philanthropic
mackintosh
had
taken
an
interest
in
the
gang
and
now
desired
subscriptions
to
send
them
to
camp
in
the
country
mccunn
in
his
new
exhilaration
felt
that
he
could
not
deny
to
others
what
he
proposed
for
himself
his
last
act
before
leaving
was
to
send
mackintosh
ten
pounds
chapter
ii
of
john
heritage
and
the
difference
in
points
of
view
dickson
mccunn
was
never
to
forget
the
first
stage
in
that
pilgrimage
a
little
after
midday
he
descended
from
a
grimy
carriage
at
a
little
station
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
in
the
village
he
purchased
some
buns
and
ginger
biscuits
to
which
he
was
partial
and
followed
by
the
shouts
of
urchins
who
admired
his
pack
look
at
the
auld
man
gaun
to
the
schule
he
emerged
into
open
country
the
late
april
noon
gleamed
like
a
frosty
morning
but
the
air
though
tonic
was
kind
the
road
ran
over
sweeps
of
moorland
where
curlews
wailed
and
into
lowland
pastures
dotted
with
very
white
very
vocal
lambs
the
young
grass
had
the
warm
fragrance
of
new
milk
as
he
went
he
munched
his
buns
for
he
had
resolved
to
have
no
plethoric
midday
meal
and
presently
he
found
the
burnside
nook
of
his
fancy
and
halted
to
smoke
on
a
patch
of
turf
close
to
a
grey
stone
bridge
he
had
out
his
walton
and
read
the
chapter
on
the
chavender
or
chub
the
collocation
of
words
delighted
him
and
inspired
him
to
verse
lavender
or
lub
pavender
or
pub
gravender
or
grub
but
the
monosyllables
proved
too
vulgar
for
poetry
regretfully
he
desisted
the
rest
of
the
road
was
as
idyllic
as
the
start
he
would
tramp
steadily
for
a
mile
or
so
and
then
saunter
leaning
over
bridges
to
watch
the
trout
in
the
pools
admiring
from
a
dyke
the
unsteady
gambols
of
lambs
kicking
up
dust
from
strips
of
on
the
heather
once
by
a
he
was
privileged
to
surprise
three
lunatic
hares
waltzing
his
cheeks
glowed
with
the
sun
he
moved
in
an
atmosphere
of
pastoral
serene
and
contented
when
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
he
arrived
at
the
village
of
cloncae
where
he
proposed
to
lie
the
inn
looked
dirty
but
he
found
a
decent
widow
above
whose
door
ran
the
legend
in
lettering
brockie
tea
and
coffee
and
who
was
willing
to
give
him
quarters
there
he
supped
handsomely
off
ham
and
eggs
and
dipped
into
a
work
called
which
garnished
a
table
decorated
with
at
nine
precisely
he
retired
to
bed
and
unhesitating
sleep
next
morning
he
awoke
to
a
changed
world
the
sky
was
grey
and
so
low
that
his
outlook
was
bounded
by
a
cabbage
garden
while
a
surly
wind
prophesied
rain
it
was
chilly
too
and
he
had
his
breakfast
beside
the
kitchen
fire
brockie
could
not
spare
a
capital
letter
for
her
surname
on
the
signboard
but
she
exalted
it
in
her
talk
he
heard
of
a
multitude
of
brockies
ascendant
descendant
and
collateral
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
fair
way
to
inherit
the
earth
dickson
listened
sympathetically
and
lingered
by
the
fire
he
felt
stiff
from
yesterday
exercise
and
the
edge
was
off
his
spirit
the
start
was
not
quite
what
he
had
pictured
his
pack
seemed
heavier
his
boots
tighter
and
his
pipe
drew
badly
the
first
miles
were
all
uphill
with
a
wind
tingling
his
ears
and
no
colours
in
the
landscape
but
brown
and
grey
suddenly
he
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
was
dismal
and
thrust
the
notion
behind
him
he
expanded
his
chest
and
drew
in
long
draughts
of
air
he
told
himself
that
this
sharp
weather
was
better
than
sunshine
he
remembered
that
all
travellers
in
romances
battled
with
mist
and
rain
presently
his
body
recovered
comfort
and
vigour
and
his
mind
worked
itself
into
cheerfulness
he
overtook
a
party
of
tramps
and
fell
into
talk
with
them
he
had
always
had
a
fancy
for
the
class
though
he
had
never
known
anything
nearer
it
than
city
beggars
he
pictured
them
as
philosophic
vagabonds
full
of
quaint
turns
of
speech
unconscious
borrovians
with
these
samples
his
disillusionment
was
speedy
the
party
was
made
up
of
a
man
with
a
red
nose
a
woman
and
a
child
in
a
crazy
perambulator
their
conversation
was
for
it
immediately
resolved
itself
into
a
whining
chronicle
of
misfortunes
and
petitions
for
relief
it
cost
him
half
a
crown
to
be
rid
of
them
the
road
was
alive
with
tramps
that
day
the
next
one
did
the
accosting
hailing
mccunn
as
he
asked
to
be
told
the
way
to
manchester
the
objective
seemed
so
enterprising
that
dickson
was
impelled
to
ask
questions
and
heard
in
what
appeared
to
be
in
the
accents
of
the
colonies
the
tale
of
a
career
of
unvarying
calamity
there
was
nothing
merry
or
philosophic
about
this
adventurer
nay
there
was
something
menacing
he
eyed
his
companion
waterproof
covetously
and
declared
that
he
had
had
one
like
it
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
the
day
before
had
the
place
been
lonely
he
might
have
contemplated
highway
robbery
but
they
were
at
the
entrance
to
a
village
and
the
sight
of
a
awoke
his
thirst
dickson
parted
with
him
at
the
cost
of
sixpence
for
a
drink
he
had
no
more
company
that
morning
except
an
aged
whom
he
convoyed
for
half
a
mile
the
also
was
soured
with
the
world
he
walked
with
a
limp
which
he
said
was
due
to
an
accident
years
before
when
he
had
been
run
into
by
ane
o
thae
damned
velocipeeds
the
word
revived
in
dickson
memories
of
his
youth
and
he
was
prepared
to
be
friendly
but
the
ancient
would
have
none
of
it
he
inquired
morosely
what
he
was
after
and
on
being
told
remarked
that
he
might
have
learned
more
sense
it
a
thing
for
an
auld
man
like
you
to
be
traivellin
the
roads
ye
maun
be
for
a
job
questioned
as
to
himself
he
became
as
the
newspapers
say
reticent
and
having
reached
his
bing
of
stones
turned
rudely
to
his
duties
awa
hame
wi
ye
were
his
parting
words
it
idle
scoondrels
like
you
that
maks
wark
for
honest
folk
like
me
the
morning
was
not
a
success
but
the
strong
air
had
given
dickson
such
an
appetite
that
he
resolved
to
break
his
rule
and
on
reaching
the
little
town
of
kilchrist
he
sought
luncheon
at
the
chief
hotel
there
he
found
that
which
revived
his
spirits
a
solitary
bagman
shared
the
meal
who
revealed
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
grocery
line
there
followed
a
and
most
technical
conversation
he
was
drawn
to
speak
of
the
united
supply
stores
limited
of
their
prospects
and
of
their
predecessor
mccunn
whom
he
knew
well
by
repute
but
had
never
met
yon
the
clever
one
he
observed
i
always
said
there
no
longer
head
in
the
city
of
glasgow
than
mccunn
an
firm
but
it
has
aye
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
times
he
just
retired
they
tell
me
and
in
my
opinion
it
a
big
loss
to
the
provision
trade
dickson
heart
glowed
within
him
here
was
romance
to
be
praised
incognito
to
enter
a
casual
inn
and
find
that
fame
had
preceded
him
he
warmed
to
the
bagman
insisted
on
giving
him
a
liqueur
and
a
cigar
and
finally
revealed
himself
i
dickson
mccunn
he
said
taking
a
bit
holiday
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
when
i
get
back
just
let
me
know
with
mutual
esteem
they
parted
he
had
need
of
all
his
good
spirits
for
he
emerged
into
an
unrelenting
drizzle
the
environs
of
kilchrist
are
at
the
best
unlovely
and
in
the
wet
they
were
as
melancholy
as
a
graveyard
but
the
encounter
with
the
bagman
had
worked
wonders
with
dickson
and
he
strode
lustily
into
the
weather
his
waterproof
collar
buttoned
round
his
chin
the
road
climbed
to
a
bare
moor
where
lagoons
had
formed
in
the
ruts
and
the
mist
showed
on
each
side
only
a
yard
or
two
of
soaking
heather
soon
he
was
wet
presently
every
part
of
him
boots
body
and
pack
was
one
vast
sponge
the
waterproof
was
not
and
the
rain
penetrated
to
his
most
intimate
garments
little
he
cared
he
felt
lighter
younger
than
on
the
idyllic
previous
day
he
enjoyed
the
buffets
of
the
storm
and
one
wet
mile
succeeded
another
to
the
accompaniment
of
shouts
and
laughter
there
was
no
one
abroad
that
afternoon
so
he
could
talk
aloud
to
himself
and
repeat
his
favourite
poems
about
five
in
the
evening
there
presented
himself
at
the
black
bull
inn
at
kirkmichael
a
soaked
disreputable
but
most
cheerful
traveller
now
the
black
bull
at
kirkmichael
is
one
of
the
few
very
good
inns
left
in
the
world
it
is
an
old
place
and
an
hospitable
for
it
has
been
for
generations
a
haunt
of
anglers
who
above
all
other
men
understand
comfort
there
are
always
bright
fires
there
and
hot
water
and
old
soft
leather
armchairs
and
an
aroma
of
good
food
and
good
tobacco
and
giant
trout
in
glass
cases
and
pictures
of
captain
barclay
of
urie
walking
to
london
and
ramsay
of
barnton
winning
a
and
the
edition
of
the
waverley
novels
with
many
volumes
missing
and
indeed
all
those
things
which
an
inn
should
have
also
there
used
to
be
there
may
still
be
sound
vintage
claret
in
the
cellars
the
black
bull
expects
its
guests
to
arrive
in
every
stage
of
dishevelment
and
dickson
was
received
by
a
cordial
landlord
who
offered
dry
garments
as
a
matter
of
course
the
pack
proved
to
have
resisted
the
elements
and
a
suit
of
clothes
and
slippers
were
provided
by
the
house
dickson
after
a
glass
of
toddy
wallowed
in
a
hot
bath
which
washed
all
the
stiffness
out
of
him
he
had
a
fire
in
his
bedroom
beside
which
he
wrote
the
opening
passages
of
that
diary
he
had
vowed
to
keep
descanting
lyrically
upon
the
joys
of
ill
weather
at
seven
warm
and
satisfied
in
soul
and
with
his
body
clad
in
raiment
several
sizes
too
large
for
it
he
descended
to
dinner
at
one
end
of
the
long
table
in
the
sat
a
group
of
anglers
they
looked
jovial
fellows
and
dickson
would
fain
have
joined
them
but
having
been
fishing
all
day
in
the
loch
o
the
threshes
they
were
talking
their
own
talk
and
he
feared
that
his
admiration
for
izaak
walton
did
not
qualify
him
to
butt
into
the
erudite
discussions
of
fishermen
the
landlord
seemed
to
think
likewise
for
he
drew
back
a
chair
for
him
at
the
other
end
where
sat
a
young
man
absorbed
in
a
book
dickson
gave
him
good
evening
and
got
an
abstracted
reply
the
young
man
supped
the
black
bull
excellent
broth
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
turned
the
pages
of
his
volume
a
glance
convinced
dickson
that
the
work
was
french
a
literature
which
did
not
interest
him
he
knew
little
of
the
tongue
and
suspected
it
of
impropriety
another
guest
entered
and
took
the
chair
opposite
the
bookish
young
man
he
was
also
young
not
more
than
and
to
dickson
eye
was
the
kind
of
person
he
would
have
liked
to
resemble
he
was
tall
and
free
from
any
superfluous
flesh
his
face
was
lean
and
deeply
sunburnt
so
that
the
hair
above
showed
oddly
pale
the
hands
were
brown
and
beautifully
shaped
but
the
forearm
revealed
by
the
loose
cuffs
of
his
shirt
was
as
brawny
as
a
blacksmith
he
had
rather
pale
blue
eyes
which
seemed
to
have
looked
much
at
the
sun
and
a
small
moustache
the
colour
of
ripe
hay
his
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
and
he
pronounced
his
words
precisely
like
a
foreigner
he
was
very
ready
to
talk
but
in
defiance
of
johnson
warning
his
talk
was
all
questions
he
wanted
to
know
everything
about
the
neighbourhood
who
lived
in
what
houses
what
were
the
distances
between
the
towns
what
harbours
would
admit
what
class
of
vessel
smiling
agreeably
he
put
dickson
through
a
catechism
to
which
he
knew
none
of
the
answers
the
landlord
was
called
in
and
proved
more
helpful
but
on
one
matter
he
was
fairly
at
a
loss
the
catechist
asked
about
a
house
called
darkwater
and
was
met
with
a
shake
of
the
head
i
know
no
name
in
this
countryside
sir
and
the
catechist
looked
disappointed
the
literary
young
man
said
nothing
but
ate
trout
abstractedly
one
eye
on
his
book
the
fish
had
been
caught
by
the
anglers
in
the
loch
o
the
threshes
and
phrases
describing
their
capture
floated
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
young
man
had
a
second
helping
and
then
refused
the
excellent
hill
mutton
that
followed
contenting
himself
with
cheese
not
so
dickson
and
the
catechist
they
ate
everything
that
was
set
before
them
topping
up
with
a
glass
of
port
then
the
latter
who
had
been
talking
illuminatingly
about
spain
rose
bowed
and
left
the
table
leaving
dickson
who
liked
to
linger
over
his
meals
to
the
society
of
the
ichthyophagous
student
he
nodded
towards
the
book
interesting
he
asked
the
young
man
shook
his
head
and
displayed
the
name
on
the
cover
anatole
france
i
used
to
be
crazy
about
him
but
now
he
seems
rather
a
back
number
then
he
glanced
towards
the
chair
australian
he
said
how
know
ca
mistake
them
there
nothing
else
so
lean
and
fine
produced
on
the
globe
i
was
next
door
to
them
at
pozi√®res
and
saw
them
fight
lord
such
men
now
and
then
you
had
a
freak
but
most
looked
like
phoebus
apollo
dickson
gazed
with
a
new
respect
at
his
neighbour
for
he
had
not
associated
him
with
during
the
war
he
had
been
a
fervent
patriot
but
though
he
had
never
heard
a
shot
himself
so
many
of
his
friends
sons
and
nephews
not
to
mention
cousins
of
his
own
had
seen
service
that
he
had
come
to
regard
the
experience
as
commonplace
lions
in
africa
and
bandits
in
mexico
seemed
to
him
novel
and
romantic
things
but
not
trenches
and
airplanes
which
were
the
whole
world
property
but
he
could
scarcely
fit
his
neighbour
into
even
his
haziest
picture
of
war
the
young
man
was
tall
and
a
little
he
had
rather
prominent
brown
eyes
untidy
black
hair
and
dark
eyebrows
which
came
near
to
meeting
he
wore
a
knickerbocker
suit
of
tweed
a
pale
blue
shirt
a
pale
blue
collar
and
a
dark
blue
tie
a
symphony
of
colour
which
seemed
too
elaborately
considered
to
be
quite
natural
dickson
had
set
him
down
as
an
artist
or
a
newspaper
correspondent
objects
to
him
of
lively
interest
but
now
the
classification
must
be
reconsidered
so
you
were
in
the
war
he
said
encouragingly
four
blasted
years
was
the
savage
reply
and
i
never
want
to
hear
the
name
of
the
beastly
thing
again
you
said
he
was
an
australian
said
dickson
casting
back
but
i
thought
australians
had
a
queer
accent
like
the
english
they
all
kind
of
accents
but
you
can
never
mistake
their
voice
it
got
the
sun
in
it
canadians
have
got
grinding
ice
in
theirs
and
virginians
have
got
butter
so
have
the
irish
in
britain
there
are
no
voices
only
speaking
tubes
it
is
safe
to
judge
men
by
their
accent
only
you
yourself
i
take
to
be
scotch
but
for
all
i
know
you
may
be
a
senator
from
chicago
or
a
boer
general
i
from
glasgow
my
name
dickson
mccunn
he
had
a
faint
hope
that
the
announcement
might
affect
the
other
as
it
had
affected
the
bagman
at
kilchrist
golly
what
a
name
exclaimed
the
young
man
rudely
dickson
was
nettled
it
very
old
highland
he
said
it
means
the
son
of
a
dog
which
christian
name
or
surname
then
the
young
man
appeared
to
think
he
had
gone
too
far
for
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
a
very
good
name
too
mine
is
prosaic
by
comparison
they
call
me
john
heritage
that
said
dickson
mollified
is
like
a
name
out
of
a
book
with
that
name
by
rights
you
should
be
a
poet
gloom
settled
on
the
young
man
countenance
it
a
dashed
sight
too
poetic
it
like
edwin
arnold
and
alfred
austin
and
dante
gabriel
rossetti
great
poets
have
vulgar
monosyllables
for
names
like
keats
the
new
shakespeare
when
he
comes
along
will
probably
be
called
grubb
or
jubber
if
he
is
jones
with
a
name
like
yours
i
might
have
a
chance
should
be
the
poet
i
very
fond
of
reading
said
dickson
modestly
a
slow
smile
crumpled
heritage
face
there
a
fire
in
the
he
observed
as
he
rose
we
better
bag
the
armchairs
before
these
fishing
louts
take
them
dickson
followed
obediently
this
was
the
kind
of
chance
acquaintance
for
whom
he
had
hoped
and
he
was
prepared
to
make
the
most
of
him
the
fire
burned
bright
in
the
little
dusky
lighted
by
one
heritage
flung
himself
into
a
chair
stretched
his
long
legs
and
lit
a
pipe
you
like
reading
he
asked
what
sort
any
use
for
poetry
plenty
said
dickson
i
aye
been
fond
of
learning
it
up
and
repeating
it
to
myself
when
i
had
nothing
to
do
in
church
and
waiting
on
trains
like
it
used
to
be
tennyson
but
now
it
more
browning
i
can
say
a
lot
of
browning
the
other
screwed
his
face
into
an
expression
of
disgust
i
know
the
stuff
cheeks
and
dewy
sister
eyelids
or
else
the
ercles
vein
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
no
good
mccunn
all
back
numbers
poetry
not
a
thing
of
pretty
round
phrases
or
noisy
invocations
it
life
itself
with
the
tang
of
the
raw
world
in
it
not
a
sweetmeat
for
women
in
parlours
are
you
a
poet
mr
heritage
no
dogson
i
a
this
was
a
new
view
to
mccunn
i
just
once
knew
a
he
observed
reflectively
they
called
him
tosh
he
drank
a
bit
well
i
do
drink
said
the
other
i
a
but
for
my
bread
and
butter
some
day
for
my
own
sake
i
may
be
a
poet
have
you
published
anything
the
eager
admiration
in
dickson
tone
gratified
heritage
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
slim
book
my
firstfruits
he
said
rather
shyly
dickson
received
it
with
reverence
it
was
a
small
volume
in
grey
paper
boards
with
a
white
label
on
the
back
and
it
was
lettered
john
heritage
he
turned
the
pages
and
read
a
little
it
a
nice
wee
book
he
observed
at
length
good
god
if
you
call
it
nice
i
must
have
failed
pretty
badly
was
the
irritated
answer
dickson
read
more
deeply
and
was
puzzled
it
seemed
worse
than
the
worst
of
browning
to
understand
he
found
one
poem
about
a
garden
entitled
revue
crimson
and
resonant
clangs
the
dawn
said
the
poet
then
he
went
on
to
describe
noonday
sunflowers
tall
grenadiers
ogle
the
roses
ballet
the
fumes
of
dark
sweet
wine
hidden
in
frail
petals
madden
the
drunkard
bees
this
seemed
to
him
an
odd
way
to
look
at
things
and
he
boggled
over
a
phrase
about
an
epicene
lily
then
came
evening
the
painted
gauze
of
the
stars
flutters
in
a
fold
of
twilight
crape
sang
heritage
and
again
the
moon
pale
leprosy
sloughs
the
fields
dickson
turned
to
other
verses
which
apparently
enshrined
the
memory
of
the
trenches
they
were
largely
compounded
of
oaths
and
rather
horrible
lingering
lovingly
over
sights
and
smells
which
every
one
is
aware
of
but
most
people
contrive
to
forget
he
did
not
like
them
finally
he
skimmed
a
poem
about
a
lady
who
turned
into
a
bird
the
evolution
was
described
with
intimate
anatomical
details
which
scared
the
honest
reader
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
book
for
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
trick
seemed
to
be
to
describe
nature
in
metaphors
mostly
drawn
from
and
haberdashers
shops
and
when
at
a
loss
to
fall
to
cursing
he
thought
it
frankly
very
bad
and
he
laboured
to
find
words
which
would
combine
politeness
and
honesty
well
said
the
poet
there
a
lot
of
fine
things
here
but
but
the
lines
do
just
seem
to
scan
very
well
heritage
laughed
now
i
can
place
you
exactly
you
like
the
meek
rhyme
and
the
conventional
epithet
well
i
do
the
world
has
passed
beyond
that
prettiness
you
want
the
moon
described
as
a
huntress
or
a
gold
disc
or
a
flower
i
say
it
oftener
like
a
beer
barrel
or
a
cheese
you
want
a
wealth
of
jolly
words
and
real
things
ruled
out
as
unfit
for
poetry
i
say
there
nothing
unfit
for
poetry
nothing
dogson
poetry
everywhere
and
the
real
thing
is
commoner
among
drabs
and
and
rubbish
heaps
than
in
your
sunday
parlours
the
poet
business
is
to
distil
it
out
of
rottenness
and
show
that
it
is
all
one
spirit
the
thing
that
keeps
the
stars
in
their
place
i
wanted
to
call
my
book
for
drains
are
sheer
poetry
carrying
off
the
excess
and
discards
of
human
life
to
make
the
fields
green
and
the
corn
ripen
but
the
publishers
kicked
so
i
called
it
to
express
my
view
of
the
exquisite
involution
of
all
things
poetry
is
the
fourth
dimension
of
the
soul
well
let
hear
about
your
taste
in
prose
mccunn
was
much
bewildered
and
a
little
inclined
to
be
cross
he
disliked
being
called
dogson
which
seemed
to
him
an
abuse
of
his
etymological
confidences
but
his
habit
of
politeness
held
he
explained
rather
haltingly
his
preferences
in
prose
heritage
listened
with
wrinkled
brows
you
even
deeper
in
the
mud
than
i
thought
he
remarked
you
live
in
a
world
of
painted
laths
and
shadows
all
this
passion
for
the
picturesque
trash
my
dear
man
like
a
schoolgirl
novelette
heroes
you
make
up
romances
about
gipsies
and
sailors
and
the
blackguards
they
call
pioneers
but
you
know
nothing
about
them
if
you
did
you
would
find
they
had
none
of
the
gilt
and
gloss
you
imagine
but
the
great
things
they
have
got
in
common
with
all
humanity
you
ignore
like
it
like
sentimentalising
about
a
pancake
because
it
looked
like
a
buttercup
and
all
the
while
not
knowing
that
it
was
good
to
eat
at
that
moment
the
australian
entered
the
room
to
get
a
light
for
his
pipe
he
wore
a
overalls
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
take
the
road
he
bade
them
good
night
and
it
seemed
to
dickson
that
his
face
seen
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
was
drawn
and
anxious
unlike
that
of
the
agreeable
companion
at
dinner
there
said
heritage
nodding
after
the
departing
figure
i
dare
say
you
have
been
telling
yourself
stories
about
that
chap
life
in
the
bush
and
the
rest
of
it
but
probably
he
a
from
melbourne
your
romanticism
is
one
vast
and
it
blinds
your
eye
to
the
real
thing
we
have
got
to
clear
it
out
and
with
it
all
the
damnable
humbug
of
the
kelt
mccunn
who
spelt
the
word
with
a
soft
c
was
puzzled
i
thought
a
kelt
was
a
kind
of
a
fish
he
interposed
but
the
other
in
the
of
his
argument
ignored
the
interruption
that
the
value
of
the
war
he
went
on
it
has
burst
up
all
the
old
conventions
and
we
got
to
finish
the
destruction
before
we
can
build
it
is
the
same
with
literature
and
religion
and
society
and
politics
at
them
with
the
axe
say
i
have
no
use
for
priests
and
pedants
i
no
use
for
upper
classes
and
middle
classes
there
only
one
class
that
matters
the
plain
man
the
workers
who
live
close
to
life
the
place
for
you
said
dickson
dryly
is
in
russia
among
the
bolsheviks
heritage
approved
they
are
doing
a
great
work
in
their
own
fashion
we
need
imitate
all
their
methods
they
a
trifle
crude
and
have
too
many
jews
among
them
but
they
got
hold
of
the
right
end
of
the
stick
they
seek
truth
and
reality
mccunn
was
slowly
being
roused
what
brings
you
wandering
hereaways
he
asked
exercise
was
the
answer
i
been
kept
pretty
closely
tied
up
all
winter
and
i
want
leisure
and
quiet
to
think
over
things
well
there
one
subject
you
might
turn
your
attention
to
you
have
been
educated
like
a
gentleman
nine
wasted
years
five
at
harrow
four
at
cambridge
see
here
then
you
daft
about
the
and
have
no
use
for
any
other
but
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
do
you
know
about
i
come
out
of
them
myself
and
have
lived
next
door
to
them
all
my
days
take
them
one
way
and
another
they
a
decent
sort
good
and
bad
like
the
rest
of
us
but
there
a
wheen
daft
folk
that
would
set
them
up
as
models
close
to
truth
and
reality
says
you
sheer
ignorance
for
you
about
as
well
acquaint
with
the
as
with
king
solomon
you
say
i
make
up
fine
stories
about
tinklers
and
because
i
know
nothing
about
them
that
maybe
true
but
you
at
the
same
job
yourself
you
ideelise
the
you
and
your
kind
because
you
ignorant
you
say
that
he
seeking
for
truth
when
he
only
looking
for
a
drink
and
a
rise
in
wages
you
tell
me
near
reality
but
i
tell
you
that
his
notion
of
reality
is
often
just
a
short
working
day
and
looking
on
at
a
on
saturday
and
when
you
run
down
what
you
call
the
that
do
of
the
world
work
and
keep
the
machine
going
and
the
working
man
in
a
job
then
i
tell
you
you
talking
havers
havers
mccunn
having
delivered
his
defence
of
the
bourgeoisie
rose
abruptly
and
went
to
bed
he
felt
jarred
and
irritated
his
innocent
little
private
domain
had
been
badly
trampled
by
this
stray
bull
of
a
poet
but
as
he
lay
in
bed
before
blowing
out
his
candle
he
had
recourse
to
walton
and
found
a
passage
on
which
as
on
a
pillow
he
went
peacefully
to
sleep
as
i
left
this
place
and
entered
into
the
next
field
a
second
pleasure
entertained
me
was
a
handsome
milkmaid
that
had
not
yet
attained
so
much
age
and
wisdom
as
to
load
her
mind
with
any
fears
of
many
things
that
will
never
be
as
too
many
men
too
often
do
but
she
cast
away
all
care
and
sang
like
a
nightingale
her
voice
was
good
and
the
ditty
fitted
for
it
it
was
the
smooth
song
that
was
made
by
now
at
least
fifty
years
ago
and
the
milkmaid
mother
sung
an
answer
to
it
which
was
made
by
walter
in
his
younger
days
they
were
poetry
but
choicely
good
i
think
much
better
than
the
strong
lines
that
are
now
in
fashion
in
this
critical
age
chapter
iii
how
childe
roland
and
another
came
to
the
dark
tower
dickson
woke
with
a
vague
sense
of
irritation
as
his
recollections
took
form
they
produced
a
very
unpleasant
picture
of
john
heritage
the
poet
had
loosened
all
his
placid
idols
so
that
they
shook
and
rattled
in
the
niches
where
they
had
been
erstwhile
so
secure
mccunn
had
a
mind
of
a
singular
candour
and
was
prepared
most
honestly
at
all
times
to
revise
his
views
but
by
this
iconoclast
he
had
been
only
irritated
and
in
no
way
convinced
poetry
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
shivered
in
his
bath
a
daily
cold
tub
instead
of
his
customary
hot
one
on
saturday
night
being
part
of
the
discipline
of
his
holiday
and
yon
blethers
about
the
he
ingeminated
as
he
shaved
he
breakfasted
alone
having
outstripped
even
the
fishermen
and
as
he
ate
he
arrived
at
conclusions
he
had
a
great
respect
for
youth
but
a
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere
the
man
a
child
he
decided
and
not
like
to
grow
up
the
way
he
besotted
on
everything
daftlike
if
it
only
and
he
no
rightly
young
either
speaks
like
an
auld
dominie
whiles
and
he
rather
impident
he
concluded
with
memories
of
he
was
very
clear
that
he
never
wanted
to
see
him
again
that
was
the
reason
of
his
early
breakfast
having
clarified
his
mind
by
definitions
dickson
felt
comforted
he
paid
his
bill
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
landlord
and
at
precisely
stepped
out
into
the
gleaming
morning
it
was
such
a
day
as
only
a
scots
april
can
show
the
cobbled
streets
of
kirkmichael
still
shone
with
the
night
rain
but
the
storm
clouds
had
fled
before
a
mild
south
wind
and
the
whole
circumference
of
the
sky
was
a
delicate
translucent
blue
homely
breakfast
smells
came
from
the
houses
and
delighted
mccunn
nostrils
a
squalling
child
was
a
pleasant
reminder
of
an
awakening
world
the
urban
counterpart
to
the
morning
song
of
birds
even
the
sanitary
cart
seemed
a
picturesque
vehicle
he
bought
his
ration
of
buns
and
ginger
biscuits
at
a
shop
whence
various
ragamuffin
boys
were
preparing
to
distribute
the
householders
bread
and
took
his
way
up
the
gallows
hill
to
the
burgh
muir
almost
with
regret
at
leaving
so
pleasant
a
habitation
a
chronicle
of
ripe
vintages
must
pass
lightly
over
small
beer
i
will
not
dwell
on
his
leisurely
progress
in
the
bright
weather
or
on
his
luncheon
in
a
coppice
of
young
firs
or
on
his
thoughts
which
had
returned
to
the
idyllic
i
take
up
the
narrative
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
he
is
revealed
seated
on
a
milestone
examining
his
map
for
he
had
come
all
unwitting
to
a
turning
of
the
ways
and
his
choice
is
the
cause
of
this
veracious
history
the
place
was
high
up
on
a
bare
moor
which
showed
a
white
lodge
among
pines
a
white
cottage
in
a
green
nook
by
a
burnside
and
no
other
marks
of
human
dwelling
to
his
left
which
was
the
east
the
heather
rose
to
a
low
ridge
of
hill
much
scarred
with
behind
which
appeared
the
blue
shoulder
of
a
considerable
mountain
before
him
the
road
was
lost
momentarily
in
the
woods
of
a
but
reappeared
at
a
great
distance
climbing
a
swell
of
upland
which
seemed
to
be
the
glacis
of
a
jumble
of
bold
summits
there
was
a
pass
there
the
map
told
him
which
led
into
galloway
it
was
the
road
he
had
meant
to
follow
but
as
he
sat
on
the
milestone
his
purpose
wavered
for
there
seemed
greater
attractions
in
the
country
which
lay
to
the
westward
mccunn
be
it
remembered
was
not
in
search
of
brown
heath
and
shaggy
wood
he
wanted
greenery
and
the
spring
westward
there
ran
out
a
peninsula
in
the
shape
of
an
isosceles
triangle
of
which
his
present
highroad
was
the
base
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
so
a
railway
ran
parallel
to
the
road
and
he
could
see
the
smoke
of
a
goods
train
waiting
at
a
tiny
station
islanded
in
acres
of
bog
thence
the
moor
swept
down
to
meadows
and
scattered
copses
above
which
hung
a
thin
haze
of
smoke
which
betokened
a
village
beyond
it
were
further
woodlands
not
firs
but
old
shady
trees
and
as
they
narrowed
to
a
point
the
gleam
of
two
tiny
estuaries
appeared
on
either
side
he
could
not
see
the
final
cape
but
he
saw
the
sea
beyond
it
flawed
with
catspaws
gold
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
on
it
a
small
herring
smack
flapping
listless
sails
something
in
the
view
caught
and
held
his
fancy
he
conned
his
map
and
made
out
the
names
the
peninsula
was
called
the
cruives
an
old
name
apparently
for
it
was
in
antique
lettering
he
vaguely
remembered
that
cruives
had
something
to
do
with
fishing
doubtless
in
the
two
streams
which
flanked
it
one
he
had
already
crossed
the
laver
a
clear
tumbling
water
springing
from
green
hills
the
other
the
garple
descended
from
the
rougher
mountains
to
the
south
the
hidden
village
bore
the
name
of
dalquharter
and
the
uncouth
syllables
awoke
some
vague
recollection
in
his
mind
the
great
house
in
the
trees
beyond
it
must
be
a
great
house
for
the
map
showed
large
policies
was
huntingtower
the
last
name
fascinated
and
almost
decided
him
he
pictured
an
ancient
keep
by
the
sea
defended
by
converging
rivers
which
some
old
comyn
lord
of
galloway
had
built
to
command
the
shore
road
and
from
which
he
had
sallied
to
hunt
in
his
wild
hills
he
liked
the
way
the
moor
dropped
down
to
green
meadows
and
the
mystery
of
the
dark
woods
beyond
he
wanted
to
explore
the
twin
waters
and
see
how
they
entered
that
strange
shimmering
sea
the
odd
names
the
odd
of
a
peninsula
powerfully
attracted
him
why
should
he
not
spend
a
night
there
for
the
map
showed
clearly
that
dalquharter
had
an
inn
he
must
decide
promptly
for
before
him
a
left
the
highway
and
the
signpost
bore
the
legend
dalquharter
and
huntingtower
mccunn
being
a
cautious
and
pious
man
took
the
omens
he
tossed
a
penny
heads
go
on
tails
turn
aside
it
fell
tails
he
knew
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
three
steps
down
the
that
he
was
doing
something
momentous
and
the
exhilaration
of
enterprise
stole
into
his
soul
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
was
the
kind
of
landscape
that
he
had
always
especially
hankered
after
and
had
made
pictures
of
when
he
had
a
longing
for
the
country
on
him
a
wooded
cape
between
streams
with
meadows
inland
and
then
a
long
lift
of
heather
he
had
the
same
feeling
of
expectancy
of
something
most
interesting
and
curious
on
the
eve
of
happening
that
he
had
had
long
ago
when
he
waited
on
the
curtain
rising
at
his
first
play
his
spirits
soared
like
the
lark
and
he
took
to
singing
if
only
the
inn
at
dalquharter
were
snug
and
empty
this
was
going
to
be
a
day
in
ten
thousand
thus
mirthfully
he
swung
down
the
rough
road
past
the
railway
till
he
came
to
a
point
where
heath
began
to
merge
in
pasture
and
walls
split
the
moor
into
fields
suddenly
his
pace
slackened
and
song
died
on
his
lips
for
approaching
from
the
right
by
a
tributary
path
was
the
poet
heritage
saw
him
afar
off
and
waved
a
friendly
hand
in
spite
of
his
chagrin
dickson
could
not
but
confess
that
he
had
misjudged
his
critic
striding
with
long
steps
over
the
heather
his
jacket
open
to
the
wind
his
face
and
his
capless
head
like
a
for
disorder
he
cut
a
more
wholesome
and
picturesque
figure
than
in
the
the
night
before
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
companionable
mood
for
he
brandished
his
stick
and
shouted
greetings
well
met
he
cried
i
was
hoping
to
fall
in
with
you
again
you
must
have
thought
me
a
pretty
fair
cub
last
night
i
did
that
was
the
dry
answer
well
i
want
to
apologise
god
knows
what
made
me
treat
you
to
a
lecture
i
may
not
agree
with
you
but
every
entitled
to
his
own
views
and
it
was
dashed
poor
form
for
me
to
start
jawing
you
mccunn
had
no
gift
of
nursing
anger
and
was
very
susceptible
to
apologies
that
all
right
he
murmured
do
mention
it
i
wondering
what
brought
you
down
here
for
it
off
the
road
caprice
pure
caprice
i
liked
the
look
of
this
of
nowhere
same
here
i
aye
thought
there
was
something
terrible
nice
about
a
wee
cape
with
a
village
at
the
neck
of
it
and
a
burn
each
side
now
that
interesting
said
heritage
you
obsessed
by
a
particular
type
of
landscape
ever
read
freud
dickson
shook
his
head
well
you
got
an
odd
complex
somewhere
i
wonder
where
the
key
lies
cape
woods
two

moor
behind

in

dogson
mccunn
was
startled
love
was
a
word
rarely
mentioned
in
his
circle
except
on
i
been
a
married
man
for
thirty
years
he
said
hurriedly
that
wo
do
it
should
have
been
a
hopeless
affair
the
last
sight
of
the
lady
on
a
spur
of
coast
with
water
on
three
sides
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
or
it
might
have
happened
to
an
ancestor
but
you
do
look
the
kind
of
breed
for
hopeless
attachments
more
likely
some
scoundrelly
old
dogson
long
ago
found
sanctuary
in
this
sort
of
place
do
you
dream
about
it
not
exactly
well
i
do
the
queer
thing
is
that
i
got
the
same
prepossession
as
you
as
soon
as
i
spotted
this
cruives
place
on
the
map
this
morning
i
saw
it
was
what
i
was
after
when
i
came
in
sight
of
it
i
almost
shouted
i
do
very
often
dream
but
when
i
do
that
the
place
i
frequent
odd
is
it
mccunn
was
deeply
interested
at
this
unexpected
revelation
of
romance
maybe
it
being
in
love
he
daringly
observed
the
poet
demurred
no
i
not
a
connoisseur
of
obvious
sentiment
that
explanation
might
fit
your
case
but
not
mine
i
pretty
certain
there
something
hideous
at
the
back
of
complex
some
grim
old
business
tucked
away
back
in
the
ages
for
though
i
attracted
by
the
place
i
frightened
too
there
seemed
no
room
for
fear
in
the
delicate
landscape
now
opening
before
them
in
front
in
groves
of
birch
and
rowans
smoked
the
first
houses
of
a
tiny
village
the
road
had
become
a
green
loaning
on
the
ample
margin
of
which
cattle
grazed
the
moorland
still
showed
itself
in
spits
of
heather
and
some
distance
off
where
a
rivulet
ran
in
a
hollow
there
were
signs
of
a
fire
and
figures
near
it
these
last
heritage
regarded
with
disapproval
some
infernal
trippers
he
murmured
or
boy
scouts
they
desecrate
everything
why
ca
the
keep
away
from
a
paradise
like
this
dickson
a
democrat
who
felt
nothing
incongruous
in
the
presence
of
other
was
meditating
a
sharp
rejoinder
when
heritage
tone
changed
ye
gods
what
a
village
he
cried
as
they
turned
a
corner
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
whitewashed
houses
all
set
in
little
gardens
of
wallflower
and
daffodil
and
early
fruit
blossom
a
triangle
of
green
filled
the
intervening
space
and
in
it
stood
an
ancient
wooden
pump
there
was
no
schoolhouse
or
kirk
not
even
a
only
a
red
box
in
a
cottage
side
beyond
rose
the
high
wall
and
the
dark
trees
of
the
demesne
and
to
the
right
up
a
which
clung
to
the
park
edge
stood
a
building
which
bore
the
legend
the
cruives
inn
the
poet
became
lyrical
at
last
he
cried
the
village
of
my
dreams
not
a
sign
of
commerce
no
church
or
school
or
beastly
recreation
hall
nothing
but
these
divine
little
cottages
and
an
ancient
pub
dogson
i
warn
you
i
going
to
have
the
devil
of
a
tea
and
he
declaimed
thou
shalt
hear
a
song
after
a
while
which
gods
may
listen
to
but
place
the
flask
upon
the
board
and
wait
until
the
stranger
hath
allayed
his
thirst
for
poets
grasshoppers
and
nightingales
sing
cheerily
but
when
the
throat
is
moist
dickson
too
longed
with
sensual
gusto
for
tea
but
as
they
drew
nearer
the
inn
lost
its
hospitable
look
the
cobbles
of
the
yard
were
weedy
as
if
rarely
visited
by
traffic
a
pane
in
a
window
was
broken
and
the
blinds
hung
tattered
the
garden
was
a
wilderness
and
the
doorstep
had
not
been
scoured
for
weeks
but
the
place
had
a
landlord
for
he
had
seen
them
approach
and
was
waiting
at
the
door
to
meet
them
he
was
a
big
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
wearing
old
riding
breeches
unbuttoned
at
the
knees
and
thick
ploughman
boots
he
had
no
leggings
and
his
fleshy
calves
were
imperfectly
covered
with
woollen
socks
his
face
was
large
and
pale
his
neck
bulged
and
he
had
a
gross
unshaven
jowl
he
was
a
type
familiar
to
students
of
society
not
the
innkeeper
which
is
a
thing
consistent
with
good
breeding
and
all
the
refinements
a
type
not
unknown
in
the
house
of
lords
especially
among
recent
creations
common
enough
in
the
house
of
commons
and
the
city
of
london
and
by
no
means
infrequent
in
the
governing
circles
of
labour
the
type
known
to
the
discerning
as
the
licensed
victualler
his
face
was
wrinkled
in
official
smiles
and
he
gave
the
travellers
a
hearty
good
afternoon
can
we
stop
here
for
the
night
dickson
asked
the
landlord
looked
sharply
at
him
and
then
replied
to
heritage
his
expression
passed
from
official
bonhomie
to
official
contrition
impossible
gentlemen
quite
impossible
ye
could
have
come
at
a
worse
time
i
only
been
here
a
fortnight
myself
and
we
have
got
right
shaken
down
yet
even
then
i
might
have
made
shift
to
do
with
ye
but
the
fact
is
we
illness
in
the
house
and
i
fair
at
my
end
it
breaks
my
heart
to
turn
gentlemen
away
and
me
that
keen
to
get
the
business
started
but
there
it
is
he
spat
vigorously
as
if
to
emphasise
the
desperation
of
his
quandary
the
man
was
clearly
scots
but
his
native
speech
was
overlaid
with
something
alien
something
which
might
have
been
acquired
in
america
or
in
going
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
he
hitched
his
breeches
too
with
a
nautical
air
is
there
nowhere
else
we
can
put
up
dickson
asked
not
in
this
place
just
a
wheen
auld
wives
that
packed
thegether
they
have
room
for
an
extra
hen
but
it
grand
weather
and
it
not
above
seven
miles
to
auchenlochan
say
the
word
and
yoke
the
horse
and
drive
ye
there
thank
you
we
prefer
to
walk
said
heritage
dickson
would
have
tarried
to
inquire
after
the
illness
in
the
house
but
his
companion
hurried
him
off
once
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
landlord
still
on
the
doorstep
gazing
after
them
that
fellow
a
swine
said
heritage
sourly
i
would
trust
my
neck
in
his
pothouse
now
dogson
i
hanged
if
i
going
to
leave
this
place
we
find
a
corner
in
the
village
somehow
besides
determined
on
tea
the
little
street
slept
in
the
clear
pure
light
of
an
early
april
evening
blue
shadows
lay
on
the
white
road
and
a
delicate
aroma
of
cooking
tantalised
hungry
nostrils
the
near
meadows
shone
like
pale
gold
against
the
dark
lift
of
the
moor
a
light
wind
had
begun
to
blow
from
the
west
and
carried
the
faintest
tang
of
salt
the
village
at
that
hour
was
pure
paradise
and
dickson
was
of
the
poet
opinion
at
all
costs
they
must
spend
the
night
there
they
selected
a
cottage
whiter
and
neater
than
the
others
which
stood
at
a
corner
where
a
narrow
lane
turned
southward
its
thatched
roof
had
been
lately
repaired
and
starched
curtains
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
decorated
the
small
windows
likewise
it
had
a
green
door
and
a
polished
brass
knocker
tacitly
the
duty
of
envoy
was
entrusted
to
mccunn
leaving
the
other
at
the
gate
he
advanced
up
the
little
path
lined
with
quartz
stones
and
politely
but
firmly
dropped
the
brass
knocker
he
must
have
been
observed
for
ere
the
noise
had
ceased
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
before
him
she
had
a
face
the
rudiments
of
a
beard
big
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
an
lace
cap
on
her
smooth
white
hair
a
little
grim
she
looked
at
first
sight
because
of
her
thin
lips
and
roman
nose
but
her
mild
curious
eyes
corrected
the
impression
and
gave
the
envoy
confidence
good
afternoon
mistress
he
said
broadening
his
voice
to
something
more
rustical
than
his
normal
glasgow
speech
me
and
my
friend
are
paying
our
first
visit
here
and
we
terrible
taken
up
with
the
place
we
would
like

his
most
ingratiating
smile
but

and
we

much
just
our
tea
and
maybe
an
egg
to
it
and
a
bowl
of
porridge
in
the
morning
the
woman
seemed
to
relent
whaur
your
freend
she
asked
peering
over
her
spectacles
towards
the
garden
gate
the
waiting
heritage
seeing
her
eyes
moving
in
his
direction
took
off
his
cap
with
a
brave
gesture
and
advanced
glorious
weather
madam
he
declared
english
whispered
dickson
to
the
woman
in
explanation
she
examined
the
poet
neat
clothes
and
mccunn
homely
garments
and
apparently
found
them
reassuring
come
in
she
said
shortly
i
see
ye
wilfu
folk
and
i
hae
to
dae
my
best
for
ye
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
two
travellers
having
been
introduced
to
two
spotless
beds
in
the
loft
and
having
washed
luxuriously
at
the
pump
in
the
back
yard
were
seated
in
morran
kitchen
before
a
meal
which
fulfilled
their
wildest
dreams
she
had
been
baking
that
morning
so
there
were
white
scones
and
barley
scones
and
oaten
farles
and
russet
pancakes
there
were
three
boiled
eggs
for
each
of
them
there
was
a
segment
of
an
immense
currant
cake
a
present
from
my
guid
brither
last
hogmanay
there
was
cheese

remained
and
the
travellers
had
that
impulse
to
activity
which
comes
to
all
men
who
after
a
day
of
exercise
and
emptiness
are
stayed
with
a
satisfying
tea
you
should
be
happy
dogson
said
the
poet
here
we
have
all
the
materials
for
your
blessed
romance
old
mansion
extinct
family
village
deserted
of
men
and
an
innkeeper
whom
i
suspect
of
being
a
villain
i
feel
almost
a
convert
to
your
nonsense
myself
we
have
a
look
at
the
house
they
turned
down
the
road
which
ran
north
by
the
park
wall
past
the
inn
which
looked
more
abandoned
than
ever
till
they
came
to
an
entrance
which
was
clearly
the
west
lodge
it
had
once
been
a
pretty
modish
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
and
dormer
windows
but
now
it
was
badly
in
need
of
repair
a
was
broken
and
stuffed
with
a
sack
the
posts
of
the
porch
were
giving
inwards
and
the
thatch
was
crumbling
under
the
attentions
of
a
colony
of
starlings
the
great
iron
gates
were
rusty
and
on
the
coat
of
arms
above
them
the
gilding
was
patchy
and
tarnished
apparently
the
gates
were
locked
and
even
the
side
wicket
failed
to
open
to
heritage
vigorous
shaking
inside
a
weedy
drive
disappeared
among
ragged
rhododendrons
the
noise
brought
a
man
to
the
lodge
door
he
was
a
sturdy
fellow
in
a
suit
of
black
clothes
which
had
not
been
made
for
him
he
might
have
been
a
butler
but
for
the
presence
of
a
pair
of
field
boots
into
which
he
had
tucked
the
ends
of
his
trousers
the
curious
thing
about
him
was
his
face
which
was
decorated
with
features
so
tiny
as
to
give
the
impression
of
a
monstrous
child
each
in
itself
was
well
enough
formed
but
eyes
nose
mouth
chin
were
of
a
smallness
curiously
out
of
proportion
to
the
head
and
body
such
an
anomaly
might
have
been
redeemed
by
the
expression
would
have
invested
it
with
an
air
of
agreeable
farce
but
there
was
no
friendliness
in
the
man
face
it
was
set
like
a
judge
in
a
stony
impassiveness
may
we
walk
up
to
the
house
heritage
asked
we
are
here
for
a
night
and
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
the
man
advanced
a
step
he
had
either
a
bad
cold
or
a
voice
comparable
in
size
to
his
features
there
no
entrance
here
he
said
huskily
i
have
strict
orders
oh
come
now
said
heritage
it
can
do
nobody
any
harm
if
you
let
us
in
for
half
an
hour
the
man
advanced
another
step
you
shall
not
come
in
go
away
from
here
go
away
i
tell
you
it
is
private
the
words
spoken
by
the
small
mouth
in
the
small
voice
had
a
kind
of
childish
ferocity
the
travellers
turned
their
back
on
him
and
continued
their
way
sich
a
curmudgeon
dickson
commented
his
face
had
flushed
for
he
was
susceptible
to
rudeness
did
you
notice
that
man
a
foreigner
he
a
brute
said
heritage
but
i
not
going
to
be
done
in
by
that
class
of
lad
there
can
be
no
gates
on
the
sea
side
so
we
work
round
that
way
for
i
wo
sleep
till
i
seen
the
place
presently
the
trees
grew
thinner
and
the
road
plunged
through
thickets
of
hazel
till
it
came
to
a
sudden
stop
in
a
field
there
the
cover
ceased
wholly
and
below
them
lay
the
glen
of
the
laver
steep
green
banks
descended
to
a
stream
which
swept
in
coils
of
gold
into
the
eye
of
the
sunset
a
little
further
down
the
channel
broadened
the
slopes
fell
back
a
little
and
a
tongue
of
glittering
sea
ran
up
to
meet
the
hill
waters
the
laver
is
a
gentle
stream
after
it
leaves
its
cradle
heights
a
stream
of
clear
pools
and
long
bright
shallows
winding
by
moorland
steadings
and
upland
meadows
but
in
its
last
it
goes
mad
and
imitates
its
childhood
when
it
tumbled
over
granite
shelves
down
in
that
green
place
the
crystal
water
gushed
and
frolicked
as
if
determined
on
one
hour
of
rapturous
life
before
joining
the
sedater
sea
heritage
flung
himself
on
the
turf
this
is
a
good
place
ye
gods
what
a
good
place
dogson
are
you
glad
you
came
i
think
everything
bewitched
that
village
is
bewitched
and
that
old
woman
tea
good
white
magic
and
that
foul
innkeeper
and
that
brigand
at
the
gate
black
magic
and
now
here
is
the
home
of
all
enchantment
valley
of
avilion
that
listen
for
lovers
all
the
rest
of
it
dickson
observed
and
marvelled
i
ca
make
you
out
heritage
you
were
saying
last
night
you
were
a
great
democrat
and
yet
you
were
objecting
to
yon
laddies
camping
on
the
moor
and
you
very
near
bit
the
neb
off
me
when
i
said
i
liked
tennyson
and
now
mccunn
command
of
language
was
inadequate
to
describe
the
transformation
you
a
precise
pragmatical
scot
was
the
answer
hang
it
man
do
remind
me
that
i
inconsistent
i
a
poet
licence
to
play
the
fool
and
if
you
do
understand
me
i
do
in
the
least
understand
myself
all
i
know
is
that
i
feeling
young
and
jolly
and
that
it
the
spring
heritage
was
assuredly
in
a
strange
mood
he
began
to
whistle
with
a
look
in
his
eye
do
you
know
what
that
is
he
asked
suddenly
dickson
who
could
not
detect
any
tune
said
no
it
an
from
a
russian
opera
that
came
out
just
before
the
war
i
forgotten
the
name
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
it
jolly
thing
it
i
always
remind
myself
of
it
when
i
in
this
mood
for
it
is
linked
with
the
greatest
experience
of
my
life
you
said
i
think
that
you
had
never
been
in
love
dickson
replied
in
the
native
fashion
have
you
he
asked
i
have
and
i
am
been
for
two
years
i
was
down
with
my
battalion
on
the
italian
front
early
in
and
because
i
could
speak
the
language
they
hoicked
me
out
and
sent
me
to
rome
on
a
liaison
job
it
was
easter
time
and
fine
weather
and
being
glad
to
get
out
of
the
trenches
i
was
pretty
well
pleased
with
myself
and
enjoying
life
in
the
place
where
i
stayed
there
was
a
girl
she
was
a
russian
a
princess
of
a
great
family
but
a
refugee
and
of
course
as
poor
as
sin
i
remember
how
badly
dressed
she
was
among
all
the
romans
but
my
god
what
a
beauty
there
was
never
anything
in
the
world
like
her
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
and
she
used
to
sing
that
air
in
the
morning
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
they
sent
me
back
to
the
front
before
i
had
a
chance
of
getting
to
know
her
but
she
used
to
give
me
little
timid
good
mornings
and
her
voice
and
eyes
were
like
an
angel
over
my
head
in
love
but
it
hopeless
quite
hopeless
i
shall
never
see
her
again
i
sure
i
honoured
by
your
confidence
said
dickson
reverently
the
poet
who
seemed
to
draw
exhilaration
from
the
memory
of
his
sorrows
arose
and
fetched
him
a
clout
on
the
back
do
talk
of
confidence
as
if
you
were
a
reporter
he
said
what
about
that
house
if
we
to
see
it
before
the
dark
comes
we
better
hustle
the
green
slopes
on
their
left
as
they
ran
seaward
were
clothed
towards
their
summit
with
a
tangle
of
broom
and
light
scrub
the
two
forced
their
way
through
this
and
found
to
their
surprise
that
on
this
side
there
were
no
defences
of
the
huntingtower
demesne
along
the
crest
ran
a
path
which
had
once
been
gravelled
and
trimmed
beyond
through
a
thicket
of
laurels
and
rhododendrons
they
came
on
a
long
unkempt
aisle
of
grass
which
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
side
avenues
often
found
in
connection
with
old
scots
dwellings
keeping
along
this
they
reached
a
grove
of
beech
and
holly
through
which
showed
a
dim
shape
of
masonry
by
a
common
impulse
they
moved
stealthily
crouching
in
cover
till
at
the
far
side
of
the
wood
they
found
a
sunk
fence
and
looked
over
an
acre
or
two
of
what
had
once
been
lawn
and
to
the
front
of
the
mansion
the
outline
of
the
building
was
clearly
silhouetted
against
the
glowing
west
but
since
they
were
looking
at
the
east
face
the
detail
was
all
in
shadow
but
dim
as
it
was
the
sight
was
enough
to
give
dickson
the
surprise
of
his
life
he
had
expected
something
old
and
baronial
but
this
was
new
raw
and
new
not
twenty
years
built
some
madness
had
prompted
its
creator
to
set
up
a
replica
of
a
tudor
house
in
a
countryside
where
the
thing
was
unheard
of
all
the
tricks
were
there
oriel
windows
lozenged
panes
high
twisted
chimney
stacks
the
very
stone
was
red
as
if
to
imitate
the
mellow
brick
of
some
ancient
kentish
manor
it
was
new
but
it
was
also
decaying
the
creepers
had
fallen
from
the
walls
the
pilasters
on
the
terrace
were
tumbling
down
lichen
and
moss
were
on
the
doorsteps
shuttered
silent
abandoned
it
stood
like
a
harsh
of
human
hopes
dickson
had
never
before
been
affected
by
an
inanimate
thing
with
so
strong
a
sense
of
disquiet
he
had
pictured
an
old
stone
tower
on
a
bright
headland
he
found
instead
this
raw
thing
among
trees
the
decadence
of
the
repels
as
something
against
nature
and
this
new
thing
was
decadent
but
there
was
a
mysterious
life
in
it
for
though
not
a
chimney
smoked
it
seemed
to
enshrine
a
personality
and
to
wear
a
sinister
he
felt
a
lively
distaste
which
was
almost
fear
he
wanted
to
get
far
away
from
it
as
fast
as
possible
the
sun
now
sinking
very
low
sent
up
rays
which
kindled
the
crests
of
a
group
of
firs
to
the
left
of
the
front
door
he
had
the
absurd
fancy
that
they
were
torches
flaming
before
a
bier
it
was
well
that
the
two
had
moved
quietly
and
kept
in
shadow
footsteps
fell
on
their
ears
on
the
path
which
threaded
the
lawn
just
beyond
the
it
was
the
keeper
of
the
west
lodge
and
he
carried
something
on
his
back
but
both
that
and
his
face
were
indistinct
in
the
other
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
a
man
shod
feet
rang
on
the
stone
of
a
flagged
path
and
from
their
irregular
fall
it
was
plain
that
he
was
lame
the
two
men
met
near
the
door
and
spoke
together
then
they
separated
and
moved
one
down
each
side
of
the
house
to
the
two
watchers
they
had
the
air
of
a
patrol
or
of
warders
pacing
the
corridors
of
a
prison
let
get
out
of
this
said
dickson
and
turned
to
go
the
air
had
the
curious
stillness
which
precedes
the
moment
of
sunset
when
the
birds
of
day
have
stopped
their
noises
and
the
sounds
of
night
have
not
begun
but
suddenly
in
the
silence
fell
notes
of
music
they
seemed
to
come
from
the
house
a
voice
singing
softly
but
with
great
beauty
and
clearness
dickson
halted
in
his
steps
the
tune
whatever
it
was
was
like
a
fresh
wind
to
blow
aside
his
depression
the
house
no
longer
looked
sepulchral
he
saw
that
the
two
men
had
hurried
back
from
their
patrol
had
met
and
exchanged
some
message
and
made
off
again
as
if
alarmed
by
the
music
then
he
noticed
his
companion
heritage
was
on
one
knee
with
his
face
rapt
and
listening
he
got
to
his
feet
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
make
for
the
house
dickson
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
into
the
bushes
and
he
followed
unresistingly
like
a
man
in
a
dream
they
ploughed
through
the
thicket
recrossed
the
grass
avenue
and
scrambled
down
the
hillside
to
the
banks
of
the
stream
then
for
the
first
time
dickson
observed
that
his
companion
face
was
very
white
and
that
sweat
stood
on
his
temples
heritage
lay
down
and
lapped
up
water
like
a
dog
then
he
turned
a
wild
eye
on
the
other
i
am
going
back
he
said
that
is
the
voice
of
the
girl
i
saw
in
rome
and
it
is
singing
her
song
chapter
iv
dougal
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
dickson
you
coming
home
to
your
supper
it
was
to
be
on
the
chap
of
nine
i
going
back
to
that
place
the
man
was
clearly
demented
and
must
be
humoured
well
you
must
wait
till
the
morn
morning
it
very
near
dark
now
and
those
are
two
ugly
customers
wandering
about
yonder
you
better
sleep
the
night
on
it
heritage
seemed
to
be
persuaded
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
up
the
now
dusky
slopes
to
the
gate
where
the
road
from
the
village
ended
he
walked
listlessly
like
a
man
engaged
in
painful
reflection
once
only
he
broke
the
silence
you
heard
the
singing
he
asked
dickson
was
a
very
poor
hand
at
a
lie
i
heard
something
he
admitted
you
heard
a
girl
voice
singing
it
sounded
like
that
was
the
admission
but
i
thinking
it
might
have
been
a
seagull
you
a
fool
said
the
poet
rudely
the
return
was
a
melancholy
business
compared
to
the
bright
speed
of
the
outward
journey
dickson
mind
was
a
chaos
of
feelings
all
of
them
unpleasant
he
had
run
up
against
something
which
he
violently
blindly
detested
and
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
not
tell
why
it
was
all
perfectly
absurd
for
why
on
earth
should
an
ugly
house
some
overgrown
trees
and
a
couple
of
servants
so
malignly
affect
him
yet
this
was
the
fact
he
had
strayed
out
of
arcady
into
a
sphere
that
filled
him
with
revolt
and
a
nameless
fear
never
in
his
experience
had
he
felt
like
this
this
foolish
childish
panic
which
took
all
the
colour
and
zest
out
of
life
he
tried
to
laugh
at
himself
but
failed
heritage
stumbling
alone
by
his
side
effectually
crushed
his
effort
to
discover
humour
in
the
situation
some
exhalation
from
that
infernal
place
had
driven
the
poet
mad
and
then
that
voice
singing
a
seagull
he
had
said
more
like
a
nightingale
he
reflected
a
bird
which
in
the
flesh
he
had
never
met
morran
had
the
lamp
lit
and
a
fire
burning
in
her
cheerful
kitchen
the
sight
of
it
somewhat
restored
dickson
equanimity
and
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
he
had
an
appetite
for
supper
there
was
new
milk
thick
with
cream
and
most
of
the
dainties
which
had
appeared
at
tea
supplemented
by
a
noble
dish
of
shimmering
the
hostess
did
not
share
their
meal
being
engaged
in
some
duties
in
the
little
known
as
the
back
kitchen
heritage
drank
a
glass
of
milk
but
would
not
touch
food
i
called
this
place
paradise
four
hours
ago
he
said
so
it
is
but
i
fancy
it
is
next
door
to
hell
there
is
something
devilish
going
on
inside
that
park
wall
and
i
mean
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
hoots
nonsense
dickson
replied
with
affected
cheerfulness
you
and
me
will
take
the
road
for
auchenlochan
we
trouble
ourselves
about
an
ugly
old
house
and
a
wheen
impident
i
going
to
get
inside
the
place
do
come
unless
you
like
but
it
no
use
arguing
with
me
my
mind
is
made
up
heritage
cleared
a
space
on
the
table
and
spread
out
a
section
of
a
ordnance
map
i
must
clear
my
head
about
the
topography
the
same
as
if
this
were
a
look
here
dogson
the
road
past
the
inn
that
we
went
by
runs
north
and
south
he
tore
a
page
from
a
and
proceeded
to
make
a
rough
one
end
we
know
abuts
on
the
laver
glen
and
the
other
stops
at
the
south
lodge
inside
the
wall
which
follows
the
road
is
a
long
belt
of
plantation
mostly
beeches
and
ash
then
to
the
west
a
kind
of
park
and
beyond
that
the
lawns
of
the
house
strips
of
plantation
with
avenues
between
follow
the
north
and
south
sides
of
the
park
on
the
sea
side
of
the
house
are
the
stables
and
what
looks
like
a
walled
garden
and
beyond
them
what
seems
to
be
open
ground
with
an
old
dovecot
marked
and
the
ruins
of
huntingtower
keep
beyond
that
there
is
more
open
ground
till
you
come
to
the
cliffs
of
the
cape
have
you
got
that
it
looks
possible
from
the
contouring
to
get
on
to
the
sea
cliffs
by
following
the
laver
for
all
that
side
is
broken
up
into
ravines
but
look
at
the
other
side
the
garple
glen
it
evidently
a
gully
and
at
the
bottom
it
opens
out
into
a
little
harbour
there
deep
water
there
you
observe
now
the
house
on
the
south
side
the
garple
side
is
built
fairly
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
is
that
all
clear
in
your
head
we
ca
reconnoitre
unless
we
got
a
working
notion
of
the
lie
of
the
land
footnote

reader

referred
to
the
improved
version
of
heritage
sketch
reproduced
as
a
frontispiece
dickson
was
about
to
protest
that
he
had
no
intention
of
reconnoitring
when
a
hubbub
arose
in
the
back
kitchen
morran
voice
was
heard
in
shrill
protest

muckle
lee
but
there
the
gentlemen
to
answer
ye
theirsels
morran
brandishing
a
dishclout
dramatically
flung
open
the
door
and
with
a
vigorous
push
propelled
into
the
kitchen
a
singular
figure
it
was
a
stunted
boy
who
from
his
face
might
have
been
fifteen
years
old
but
had
the
stature
of
a
child
of
twelve
he
had
a
thatch
of
fiery
red
hair
above
a
pale
freckled
countenance
his
nose
was
snub
his
eyes
a
sulky
and
his
wide
mouth
disclosed
large
and
damaged
teeth
but
remarkable
as
was
his
visage
his
clothing
was
still
stranger
on
his
head
was
the
regulation
boy
scout
hat
but
it
was
several
sizes
too
big
and
was
squashed
down
upon
his
immense
red
ears
he
wore
a
very
ancient
khaki
shirt
which
had
once
belonged
to
a
soldier
and
the
spacious
sleeves
were
rolled
up
at
the
shoulders
and
tied
with
string
revealing
a
pair
of
skinny
arms
round
his
middle
hung
what
was
meant
to
be
a
kilt
a
kilt
of
home
manufacture
which
may
once
have
been
a
tablecloth
for
its
bold
pattern
suggested
no
known
clan
tartan
he
had
a
massive
belt
in
which
was
stuck
a
broken
and
round
his
neck
was
knotted
the
remnant
of
what
had
once
been
a
silk
bandana
his
legs
and
feet
were
bare
blue
scratched
and
very
dirty
and
his
toes
had
the
prehensile
look
common
to
monkeys
and
small
boys
who
summer
and
winter
go
bootless
in
his
hand
was
a
long
new
cut
from
some
coppice
the
apparition
stood
glum
and
lowering
on
the
kitchen
floor
as
dickson
stared
at
it
he
recalled
mearns
street
and
the
band
of
irregular
boy
scouts
who
paraded
to
the
roll
of
tin
cans
before
him
stood
dougal
chieftain
of
the
gorbals
suddenly
he
remembered
the
philanthropic
mackintosh
and
his
own
subscription
of
ten
pounds
to
the
camp
fund
it
pleased
him
to
find
the
rascals
here
for
in
the
unpleasant
affairs
on
the
verge
of
which
he
felt
himself
they
were
a
comforting
reminder
of
the
peace
of
home
i
glad
to
see
you
dougal
he
said
pleasantly
how
are
you
all
getting
on
and
then
with
a
vague
reminiscence
of
the
code
have
you
been
minding
to
perform
a
good
deed
every
day
the
chieftain
brow
darkened
deeds
he
repeated
bitterly
i
tell
ye
i
fair
wore
out
good
deeds
yon
man
mackintosh
me
this
was
going
to
be
a
grand
holiday
holiday
govey
dick
it
been
like
a
setterday
night
in
main
street
a
fechtin
fechtin
no
collocation
of
letters
could
reproduce
dougal
accent
and
i
will
not
attempt
it
there
was
a
touch
of
irish
in
it
a
spice
of
patter
as
well
as
the
odd
lilt
of
the
glasgow
vernacular
he
was
strong
in
vowels
but
the
consonants
especially
the
letter
t
were
only
aspirations
sit
down
and
let
hear
about
things
said
dickson
the
boy
turned
his
head
to
the
still
open
back
door
where
morran
could
be
heard
at
her
labours
he
stepped
across
and
shut
it
i
wantin
that
auld
wife
to
hear
he
said
then
he
squatted
down
on
the
patchwork
rug
by
the
hearth
and
warmed
his
shins
looking
into
the
glow
of
the
fire
he
observed
i
seen
you
two
up
by
the
big
hoose
the
night
the
devil
you
did
said
heritage
roused
to
a
sudden
attention
and
where

seven
feet
from
your
head
up
a
tree

shot

dickson
exclaimed
and
dougal
with
morose
pride
showed
a
rent
in
his
kilt
if

had
had

he
ha
got

to

crackin
thegither
but
what

did
the
man

the
scandalised
dickson
what

because
they
frightened

death

onybody

auld

pair
of
deevils

as
soon
as
i
seen
the
man

i
once
seen
the
same
kind
o
scoondrel
at
the
picters
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
swear
i
kenned
he
was
a
foreigner
like
the
lads
down
at
the
broomielaw
that
looked
black
but
i
had
got
at
the
worst
of
it
then
he
loosed
off
at
me
wi
his
gun
were
you

dickson
ay

but
ye
no
choke
off
the
gorbals
wi
a
gun
we
held
a
meetin
round
the
camp
fire
and
we
resolved
to
get
to
the
bottom
o
the
business
me
bein
their
chief
it
was
my
duty
to
make
what
they
ca
a
reckonissince
for
that
was
the
dangerous
job
so
this
day
i
been
going
on
my
belly
about
thae
policies
i
found
out
some
queer
things
heritage
had
risen
and
was
staring
down
at
the
small
squatting
figure
what
have
you
found
out
quick
tell
me
at
once
his
voice
was
sharp
and
excited

a
wee

the
unwinking
dougal
i
no

let
ye
into
this
business
till
i
ken
that

far
bigger
job
than
i
thought
there
more
in
it
than
lean
and
spittal
there
the
big
man
that
keeps
the
public
dobson
they
ca
him
he
a
namerican
which
looks
bad
and
there
tinklers
campin
down
in
the
garple
dean
they
in
it
for
dobson
was
colloguin
wi
them
a
mornin
when
i

thought

gang
till
i
mindit
that
one
ye
was
auld
mccunn
that

the
shop
in

look
o
lean
and
i
followed
ye
here
for
i
was
i
needit

heritage
plucked
dougal
by
the
shoulder
and
lifted
him
to
his
feet
for
god
sake
boy
he
cried
tell
us
what
you
know
will
ye
help
of
course
you
little
fool
then
swear
said
the
ritualist
from
a
grimy
wallet
he
extracted
a
limp
little
volume
which
proved
to
be
a
damaged
copy
of
a
work
entitled
songs
and
here
take
that
in
your
right
hand
and
put
your
left
hand
on
my
pole
and
say
after
me
swear
no
to
blab
what
is
telled
me
in
secret
and
to
be
swift
and
sure
in
obeyin
orders
me
god
syne
kiss
the
bookie
dickson
at
first
refused
declaring
it
was
all
havers
but
docility
persuaded
him
to
follow
suit
the
two
were
sworn
now
said
heritage
dougal
squatted
again
on
the
and
gathered
the
eyes
of
his
audience
he
was
enjoying
himself
this
day
he
said
slowly
i
got
inside
the
hoose
stout
fellow
said
heritage
and
what
did
you
find
there
i
got
inside
that
hoose
but
it
was
once
or
twice
i
tried
i
found
a
corner
where
i
was
out
o
sight
o
anybody
unless
they
had
come
there
seekin
me
and
i
sklimmed
up
a
rone
pipe
but
a
the
windies
were
lockit
and
i
verra
near
broke
my
neck
syne
i
tried
the
roof
and
a
sore
sklim
i
had
but
when
i
got
there
there
were
no
skylights
at
the
end
i
got
in
by
the
that
why
ye
maybe
thinkin
i
no
very
clean
heritage
patience
was
nearly
exhausted
i
do
want
to
hear
how
you
got
in
what
did
you
find
you
little
devil
inside
the
hoose
said
dougal
slowly
and
there
was
a
melancholy
sense
of
in
his
voice
as
of
one
who
had
hoped
to
speak
of
gold
and
jewels
and
armed
men
inside
that
hoose
there
nothing
but
two
women
heritage
sat
down
before
him
with
a
stern
face
describe
them
he
commanded
one
o
them
is
dead
auld
as
auld
as
the
wife
here
she
did
look
to
me
very
right
in
the
head
and
the
other
oh
just
a
lassie
what
was
she
like
dougal
seemed
to
be
searching
for
adequate
words
she
is
he
began
then
a
popular
song
gave
him
inspiration
she
pure
as
the
lully
in
the
dell
in
no
way
discomposed
by
heritage
fierce
interrogatory
air
he
continued
she
either
foreign
or
english
for
she
could
understand
what
i
said
and
i
could
make
nothing
o
her
clippit
tongue
but
i
could
see
she
had
been
greetin
she
looked
feared
yet
kind
o
determined
i
speired
if
i
could
do
anything
for
her
and
when
she
got
my
meaning
she
was
terrible
anxious
to
ken
if
i
had
seen
a
man
a
big
man
she
said
wi
a
yellow
beard
she
did
seem
to
ken
his
name
or
else
she
would
tell
me
the
auld
wife
was
mortal
feared
and
was
aye
in
a
foreign
langwidge
i
seen
at
once
that
what
frightened
them
was
lean
and
his
friends
and
i
was
just
starting
to
speir
about
them
when
there
came
a
sound
like
a
man
walkin
along
the
passage
she
was
for
hidin
me
in
behind
a
sofy
but
i
was
going
to
be
trapped
like
that
so
i
got
out
by
the
other
door
and
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
into
the
gosh
it
was
a
near
thing
the
boy
was
on
his
feet
i
must
be
off
to
the
camp
to
give
out
the
orders
for
the
morn
i
going
back
to
that
hoose
for
it
a
fight
atween
the
gorbals
and
the
scoundrels
that
are
thae
women
the
question
is
are
ye
comin
with
me
mind
ye
sworn
but
if
ye
no
i
going
mysel
though
i
no
deny
i
be
glad
company
anyway
he
added
nodding
at
heritage
maybe
auld
mccunn
would
get
through
the
you
an
impident
laddie
said
the
outraged
dickson
it
no
likely
we
coming
with
you
breaking
into
other
folks
houses
it
a
job
for
the
police
please
yersel
said
the
chieftain
and
looked
at
heritage
i
on
said
that
gentleman
well
just
you
set
out
the
morn
as
if
ye
were
for
a
walk
up
the
garple
glen
i
be
on
the
road
and
i
have
orders
for
ye
without
more
ado
dougal
left
by
way
of
the
back
kitchen
there
was
a
brief
denunciation
from
morran
then
the
outer
door
banged
and
he
was
gone
the
poet
sat
still
with
his
head
in
his
hands
while
dickson
acutely
uneasy
prowled
about
the
floor
he
had
forgotten
even
to
light
his
pipe
you
not
be
thinking
of
heeding
that
ragamuffin
boy
he
ventured
i
certainly
going
to
get
into
the
house
heritage
answered
and
if
he
can
show
me
a
way
so
much
the
better
he
a
spirited
youth
do
you
breed
many
like
him
in
glasgow
plenty
said
dickson
sourly
see
here
heritage
you
expect
me
to
be
going
about
burgling
houses
on
the
word
of
a
blagyird
laddie
i
a
respectable
man
aye
been
besides
i
here
for
a
holiday
and
i
no
call
to
be
mixing
myself
up
in
strangers
affairs
you
have
only
you
see
i
think
there
a
friend
of
mine
in
that
place
and
anyhow
there
are
women
in
trouble
if
you
like
we
say
after
breakfast
and
you
can
continue
as
if
you
had
never
turned
aside
to
this
damned
peninsula
but
i
got
to
stay
dickson
groaned
what
had
become
of
his
dream
of
idylls
his
gentle
bookish
romance
vanished
before
a
reality
which
smacked
horribly
of
crude
melodrama
and
possibly
of
sordid
crime
his
gorge
rose
at
the
picture
but
a
thought
troubled
him
perhaps
all
romance
in
its
hour
of
happening
was
rough
and
ugly
like
this
and
only
shone
rosy
in
the
retrospect
was
he
being
false
to
his
deepest
faith
let
have
morran
in
he
ventured
she
a
wise
old
body
and
like
to
hear
her
opinion
of
this
business
we
get
common
sense
from
her
i
do
object
said
heritage
but
no
amount
of
common
sense
will
change
my
mind
their
hostess
forestalled
them
by
returning
at
that
moment
to
the
kitchen
we
want
your
advice
mistress
dickson
told
her
and
accordingly
like
a
barrister
with
a
client
she
seated
herself
carefully
in
the
big
easy
chair
found
and
adjusted
her
spectacles
and
waited
with
hands
folded
on
her
lap
to
hear
the
business
dickson
narrated
their
doings
and
gave
a
sketch
of
dougal
evidence
his
exposition
was
cautious
and
colourless
and
without
conviction
he
seemed
to
expect
a
robust
incredulity
in
his
hearer
morran
listened
with
the
gravity
of
one
in
church
when
dickson
finished
she
seemed
to
meditate
there
no
blagyird
trick
that
would
surprise
me
in
thae
new
folk
what
that
ye
ca
them
lean
and
spittal
eppie
home
threepit
to
me
they
were
furriners
and
these
are
no
furrin
names
what
i
want
to
hear
from
you
morran
said
dickson
impressively
is
whether
you
think
there
anything
in
that
boy
story
i
think
it
maist
likely
true
he
a
terrible
impident
callant
but
he
no
a
leear
then
you
think
that
a
gang
of
ruffians
have
got
two
lone
women
shut
up
in
that
house
for
their
own
purposes
i
wadna
wonder
but
it
ridiculous
this
is
a
christian
and
country
what
would
the
police
say
they
never
troubled
dalquharter
muckle
there
no
a
polisman
nearer
than
knockraw
yin
johnnie
trummle
and
he
as
useless
as
a
frostit
tattie
the
wiselike
thing
as
i
think
said
dickson
would
be
to
turn
the
on
to
the
job
it
his
business
no
ours
weel
i
wadna
say
but
ye
richt
said
the
lady
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
us
dickson
tone
was
subtly
confidential
my
friend
here
wants
to
get
into
the
house
the
morn
with
that
laddie
to
satisfy
himself
about
the
facts
i

crooked
smile

young
and
yauld
like
you
i

speired
my

sirs
and
gotten
it
now
i
maun
clear
awa
your
supper
dickson
asked
for
a
candle
and
as
on
the
previous
night
went
abruptly
to
bed
the
oracle
of
prudence
to
which
he
had
appealed
had
betrayed
him
and
counselled
folly
but
was
it
folly
for
him
assuredly
for
dickson
mccunn
late
of
mearns
street
glasgow
wholesale
and
retail
provision
merchant
elder
in
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
and
years
of
age
ay
that
was
the
rub
he
was
getting
old
the
woman
had
seen
it
and
had
advised
him
to
go
home
yet
the
plea
was
curiously
irksome
though
it
gave
him
the
excuse
he
needed
if
you
played
at
being
young
you
had
to
take
up
the
obligations
of
youth
and
he
thought
derisively
of
his
boyish
exhilaration
of
the
past
days
derisively
but
also
sadly
what
had
become
of
that
innocent
joviality
he
had
dreamed
of
that
happy
morning
pilgrimage
of
spring
enlivened
by
tags
from
the
poets
his
goddess
had
played
him
false
romance
had
put
upon
him
too
hard
a
trial
he
lay
long
awake
torn
between
common
sense
and
a
desire
to
be
loyal
to
some
vague
whimsical
standard
heritage
a
yard
distant
appeared
also
to
be
sleepless
for
the
bed
creaked
with
his
turning
dickson
found
himself
envying
one
whose
troubles
whatever
they
might
be
were
not
those
of
a
divided
mind
chapter
v
of
the
princess
in
the
tower
very
early
next
morning
while
morran
was
still
cooking
breakfast
dickson
and
heritage
might
have
been
observed
taking
the
air
in
the
village
street
it
was
the
poet
who
had
insisted
upon
this
walk
and
he
had
his
own
purpose
they
looked
at
the
spires
of
smoke
piercing
the
windless
air
and
studied
the
daffodils
in
the
cottage
gardens
dickson
was
glum
but
heritage
seemed
in
high
spirits
he
varied
his
garrulity
with
spells
of
cheerful
whistling
they
strode
along
the
road
by
the
park
wall
till
they
reached
the
inn
there
heritage
music
waxed
peculiarly
loud
presently
from
the
yard
unshaven
and
looking
as
if
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
came
dobson
the
innkeeper
good
morning
said
the
poet
i
hope
the
sickness
in
your
house
is
on
the
mend
thank
ye
it
no
worse
was
the
reply
but
in
the
man
heavy
face
there
was
little
civility
his
small
grey
eyes
searched
their
faces
we
just
waiting
on
breakfast
to
get
on
the
road
again
i
jolly
glad
we
spent
the
night
here
we
found
quarters
after
all
you
know
so
i
see
whereabouts
may
i
ask
morran
we
could
always
have
got
in
there
but
we
did
want
to
fuss
an
old
lady
so
we
thought
we
try
the
inn
first
she
my
friend
aunt
at
this
amazing
falsehood
dickson
started
and
the
man
observed
his
surprise
the
eyes
were
turned
on
him
like
a
searchlight
they
roused
antagonism
in
his
peaceful
soul
and
with
that
antagonism
came
an
impulse
to
back
up
the
poet
ay
he
said
she
my
auntie
phemie
my
mother
the
man
turned
on
heritage
where
are
ye
for
the
day
auchenlochan
said
dickson
hastily
he
was
still
determined
to
shake
the
dust
of
dalquharter
from
his
feet
the
innkeeper
sensibly
brightened
well
ye
have
a
fine
walk
i
must
go
in
and
see
about
my
own
breakfast
good
day
to
ye
gentlemen
that
said
heritage
as
they
entered
the
village
street
again
is
the
first
step
in
camouflage
to
put
the
enemy
off
his
guard
it
was
an
abominable
lie
said
dickson
crossly
not
at
all
it
was
a
necessary
and
proper
de
it
explained
why
we
spent
the
night
here
and
now
dobson
and
his
friends
can
get
about
their
day
work
with
an
easy
mind
their
suspicions
are
temporarily
allayed
and
that
will
make
our
job
easier
i
not
coming
with
you
i
never
said
you
were
by
i
refer
to
myself
and
the
boy
mistress
you
my
auntie
dickson
informed
morran
as
she
set
the
porridge
on
the
table
this
gentleman
has
just
been
telling
the
man
at
the
inn
that
you
my
auntie
phemie
for
a
second
their
hostess
looked
bewildered
then
the
corners
of
her
prim
mouth
moved
upwards
in
a
slow
smile
i
see
she
said
weel
maybe
it
was
weel
done
but
if
ye
my
nevoy
ye
hae
to
keep
up
my
credit
for
we
a
bauld
and
siccar
lot
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
furious
dissension
when
dickson
attempted
to
pay
for
the
night
entertainment
morran
would
have
none
of
it
ye
no
awa
yet
she
said
tartly
and
the
matter
was
complicated
by
heritage
refusal
to
take
part
in
the
debate
he
stood
aside
and
grinned
till
dickson
in
despair
returned
his
to
his
pocket
murmuring
darkly
that
he
would
send
it
from
glasgow
the
road
to
auchenlochan
left
the
main
village
street
at
right
angles
by
the
side
of
morran
cottage
it
was
a
better
road
than
that
which
they
had
come
yesterday
for
by
it
twice
daily
the
travelled
to
the
it
ran
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
and
on
the
lip
of
the
garple
glen
till
it
crossed
that
stream
and
keeping
near
the
coast
emerged
after
five
miles
into
the
cultivated
flats
of
the
lochan
valley
the
morning
was
fine
the
keen
air
invited
to
high
spirits
plovers
piped
entrancingly
over
the
bent
and
linnets
sang
in
the
whins
there
was
a
solid
breakfast
behind
him
and
the
promise
of
a
cheerful
road
till
luncheon
the
stage
was
set
for
good
humour
but
dickson
heart
which
should
have
been
ascending
with
the
larks
stuck
leadenly
in
his
boots
he
was
not
even
relieved
at
putting
dalquharter
behind
him
the
atmosphere
of
that
unhallowed
place
lay
still
on
his
soul
he
hated
it
but
he
hated
himself
more
here
was
one
who
had
hugged
himself
all
his
days
as
an
adventurer
waiting
his
chance
running
away
at
the
first
challenge
of
adventure
a
lover
of
romance
who
fled
from
the
earliest
overture
of
his
goddess
he
was
ashamed
and
angry
but
what
else
was
there
to
do
burglary
in
the
company
of
a
queer
poet
and
a
queerer
urchin
it
was
unthinkable
presently
as
they
tramped
silently
on
they
came
to
the
bridge
beneath
which
the
peaty
waters
of
the
garple
ran
in
pools
and
tawny
cascades
from
a
clump
of
elders
on
the
other
side
dougal
emerged
a
barefoot
boy
dressed
in
much
the
same
parody
of
a
boy
uniform
but
with
corduroy
shorts
instead
of
a
kilt
stood
before
him
at
rigid
attention
some
command
was
issued
the
child
saluted
and
trotted
back
past
the
travellers
with
never
a
look
at
them
discipline
was
strong
among
the
gorbals
no
chief
of
staff
ever
conversed
with
his
general
under
a
stricter
etiquette
dougal
received
the
travellers
with
the
condescension
of
a
regular
towards
civilians
they
off
their
gawrd
he
announced
thomas
yownie
has
been
shadowin
them
since
skreigh
o
day
and
he
reports
that
dobson
and
lean
followed
ye
till
ye
were
out
o
sight
o
the
houses
and
syne
lean
got
a
and
watched
ye
till
the
road
turned
in
among
the
trees
that
satisfied
them
and
they
both
away
back
to
their
jobs
thomas
yownie
the
fell
yin
ye
no
fickle
thomas
yownie
dougal
extricated
from
his
pouch
the
fag
of
a
cigarette
lit
it
and
puffed
meditatively
i
did
a
reckonissince
mysel
this
morning
i
was
up
at
the
hoose
afore
it
was
light
and
tried
the
door
o
the
i
doot
they
gotten
on
our
tracks
for
it
was
lockit
ay
and
wedged
from
the
inside
dickson
brightened
was
the
insane
venture
off
for
a
wee
bit
i
was
fair
beat
but
i
mindit
that
the
lassie
was
allowed
to
walk
in
a
kind
o
a
glass
hoose
on
the
side
farthest
away
from
the
garple
that
was
where
she
was
singin
so
i
reckonissinced
in
that
direction
and
i
fund
a
queer
place
songs
and
was
requisitioned
and
on
a
page
of
it
dougal
proceeded
to
make
marks
with
the
stump
of
a
carpenter
pencil
see
here
he
commanded
the
glass
place
wi
a
door
into
the
hoose
that
door
must
be
open
or
the
lassie
must
have
the
key
for
she
comes
there
whenever
she
likes
now
at
each
end
o
the
place
the
doors
are
lockit
but
the
front
that
looks
on
the
garden
is
open
wi
muckle
posts
and
the
trouble
is
that
that
side
there
maybe
twenty
feet
o
a
wall
between
the
pawrapet
and
the
ground
it
an
auld
wall
wi
cracks
and
holes
in
it
and
it
would
be
ill
to
sklim
that
why
they
let
her
gang
there
when
she
wants
for
a
lassie
could
get
away
without
breakin
her
neck
could
we
climb
it
heritage
asked
the
boy
wrinkled
his
brows
i
could
manage
it
mysel
i
think
and
maybe
you
i
doubt
if
auld
mccunn
could
get
up
ye
have
to
be
mighty
carefu
that
nobody
saw
ye
for
your
hinder
end
as
ye
were
sklimmin
wad
be
a
grand
mark
for
a
gun
lead
on
said
heritage
we
try
the
verandah
they
both
looked
at
dickson
and
dickson
scarlet
in
the
face
looked
back
at
them
he
had
suddenly
found
the
thought
of
a
solitary
march
to
auchenlochan
intolerable
once
again
he
was
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
once
more
caprice
determined
his
decision
that
the
was
out
of
the
question
had
worked
a
change
in
his
views
somehow
it
seemed
to
him
less
burglarious
to
enter
by
a
verandah
he
felt
very
frightened
but
for
the
moment
quite
resolute
i
coming
with
you
he
said
sportsman
said
heritage
and
held
out
his
hand
well
done
the
auld
yin
said
the
chieftain
of
the
gorbals
dickson
quaking
heart
experienced
a
momentary
bound
as
he
followed
heritage
down
the
track
into
the
garple
dean
the
track
wound
through
a
thick
covert
of
hazels
now
close
to
the
rushing
water
now
high
upon
the
bank
so
that
clear
sky
showed
through
the
fringes
of
the
wood
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
dougal
halted
them
it
a
ticklish
job
he
whispered
there
the
tinklers
mind
campin
in
the
dean
if
they
still
in
their
camp
we
can
get
by
easy
enough
but
they
maybe
wanderin
about
the
wud
after
rabbits
then
we
must
ford
the
water
for
ye
no
cross
it
lower
down
where
deep
our
road
is
on
the
hoose
side
o
the
dean
and
it
awfu
public
if
there
onybody
on
the
other
side
though
it
hid
well
enough
from
folk
up
in
the
policies
ye
must
do
exactly
what
i
tell
ye
when
we
get
near
danger
i
scout
on
ahead
and
i
daur
ye
to
move
a
hair
your
head
till
i
give
the
word
presently
when
they
were
at
the
edge
of
the
water
dougal
announced
his
intention
of
crossing
three
boulders
in
the
stream
made
a
bridge
for
an
active
man
and
heritage
hopped
lightly
over
not
so
dickson
who
stuck
fast
on
the
second
stone
and
would
certainly
have
fallen
in
had
not
dougal
plunged
into
the
current
and
steadied
him
with
a
grimy
hand
the
leap
was
at
last
successfully
taken
and
the
three
scrambled
up
a
rough
scaur
all
reddened
with
iron
springs
till
they
struck
a
slender
track
running
down
the
dean
on
its
northern
side
here
the
undergrowth
was
very
thick
and
they
had
gone
the
better
part
of
half
a
mile
before
the
covert
thinned
sufficiently
to
show
them
the
stream
beneath
then
dougal
halted
them
with
a
finger
on
his
lips
and
crept
forward
alone
he
returned
in
three
minutes
coast
clear
he
whispered
the
tinklers
are
eatin
their
breakfast
they
late
at
their
meat
though
they
up
early
seekin
it
progress
was
now
very
slow
and
secret
and
mainly
on
all
fours
at
one
point
dougal
nodded
downward
and
the
other
two
saw
on
a
patch
of
turf
where
the
garple
began
to
widen
into
its
estuary
a
group
of
figures
round
a
small
fire
there
were
four
of
them
all
men
and
dickson
thought
he
had
never
seen
such
customers
after
that
they
moved
high
up
the
slope
in
a
shallow
glade
of
a
tributary
burn
till
they
came
out
of
the
trees
and
found
themselves
looking
seaward
on
one
side
was
the
house
a
hundred
yards
or
so
back
from
the
edge
the
roof
showing
above
the
precipitous
scarp
down
the
slope
became
easier
a
jumble
of
boulders
and
till
it
reached
the
waters
of
the
small
haven
which
lay
calm
as
a
in
the
windless
forenoon
the
haven
broadened
out
at
its
foot
and
revealed
a
segment
of
blue
sea
the
opposite
shore
was
flatter
and
showed
what
looked
like
an
old
wharf
and
the
ruins
of
buildings
behind
which
rose
a
bank
clad
with
scrub
and
surmounted
by
some
gnarled
and
firs
there
dashed
little
cover
here
said
heritage
there
no
muckle
dougal
assented
but
they
canna
see
us
from
the
policies
and
it
no
like
there
anybody
watchin
from
the
hoose
the
danger
is
somebody
on
the
other
side
but
we
have
to
risk
it
once
among
thae
big
stones
we
safe
are
ye
ready
five
minutes
later
dickson
found
himself
gasping
in
the
lee
of
a
boulder
while
dougal
was
making
a
cast
forward
the
scout
returned
with
a
hopeful
report
i
think
we
safe
till
we
get
into
the
policies
there
a
road
that
the
auld
folk
made
when
ships
used
to
come
here
down
there
it
deeper
than
clyde
at
the
broomilaw
has
the
auld
yin
got
his
wind
yet
there
no
time
to
waste
up
that
broken
hillside
they
crawled
well
in
the
cover
of
the
tumbled
stones
till
they
reached
a
low
wall
which
was
the
boundary
of
the
garden
the
house
was
now
behind
them
on
their
right
rear
and
as
they
topped
the
crest
they
had
a
glimpse
of
an
ancient
dovecot
and
the
ruins
of
the
old
huntingtower
on
the
short
thymy
turf
which
ran
seaward
to
the
cliffs
dougal
led
them
along
a
sunk
fence
which
divided
the
downs
from
the
lawns
behind
the
house
and
avoiding
the
stables
brought
them
by
devious
ways
to
a
thicket
of
rhododendrons
and
broom
on
all
fours
they
travelled
the
length
of
the
place
and
came
to
the
edge
where
some
forgotten
gardeners
had
once
tended
a
herbaceous
border
the
border
was
now
rank
and
wild
and
lying
flat
under
the
shade
of
an
azalea
and
peering
through
the
young
spears
of
iris
dickson
and
heritage
regarded
the
fa√ßade
of
the
house
the
ground
before
them
had
been
a
sunken
garden
from
which
a
steep
wall
once
covered
with
creepers
and
rock
plants
rose
to
a
long
verandah
which
was
pillared
and
open
on
that
side
but
at
each
end
built
up
and
glazed
for
the
rest
there
was
a
glass
roof
and
inside
untended
shrubs
sprawled
in
broken
plaster
vases
ye
must
bide
here
said
dougal
and
no
cheep
above
your
breath
afore
we
dare
to
try
that
wall
i
must
ken
where
lean
and
spittal
and
dobson
are
i
off
to
spy
the
policies
he
glided
out
of
sight
behind
a
clump
of
pampas
grass
for
hours
so
it
seemed
dickson
was
left
to
his
own
unpleasant
reflections
his
body
prone
on
the
moist
earth
was
fairly
comfortable
but
his
mind
was
ill
at
ease
the
scramble
up
the
hillside
had
convinced
him
that
he
was
growing
old
and
there
was
no
rebound
in
his
soul
to
counter
the
conviction
he
felt
listless
spiritless
an
apathy
with
fright
trembling
somewhere
at
the
back
of
it
he
regarded
the
verandah
wall
with
foreboding
how
on
earth
could
he
climb
that
and
if
he
did
there
would
be
his
exposed
inviting
a
shot
from
some
malevolent
gentleman
among
the
trees
he
reflected
that
he
would
give
a
large
sum
of
money
to
be
out
of
this
preposterous
adventure
heritage
hand
was
stretched
towards
him
containing
two
of
morran
jellied
scones
of
which
the
poet
had
been
wise
enough
to
bring
a
supply
in
his
pocket
the
food
cheered
him
for
he
was
growing
very
hungry
and
he
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
scene
before
him
instead
of
his
own
thoughts
he
observed
every
detail
of
the
verandah
there
was
a
door
at
one
end
he
noted
giving
on
a
path
which
wound
down
to
the
sunk
garden
as
he
looked
he
heard
a
sound
of
steps
and
saw
a
man
ascending
this
path
it
was
the
lame
man
whom
dougal
had
called
spittal
the
dweller
in
the
south
lodge
seen
at
closer
quarters
he
was
an
being
lean
as
a
heron
but
amazingly
quick
on
his
feet
had
not
morran
said
that
he
hobbled
as
fast
as
other
folk
ran
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
as
he
went
but
he
was
alert
enough
for
the
dropping
of
a
twig
from
a
dying
magnolia
transferred
him
in
an
instant
into
a
figure
of
active
vigilance
no
risks
could
be
run
with
that
watcher
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
opened
the
garden
door
and
entered
the
verandah
for
a
moment
his
shuffle
sounded
on
its
tiled
floor
and
then
he
entered
the
door
admitting
from
the
verandah
to
the
house
it
was
clearly
unlocked
for
there
came
no
sound
of
a
turning
key
dickson
had
finished
the
last
crumbs
of
his
scones
before
the
man
emerged
again
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
greater
hurry
than
ever
as
he
locked
the
garden
door
behind
him
and
hobbled
along
the
west
front
of
the
house
till
he
was
lost
to
sight
after
that
the
time
passed
slowly
a
pair
of
yellow
wagtails
arrived
and
played
at
among
the
stuccoed
pillars
the
little
dry
scratch
of
their
claws
was
heard
clearly
in
the
still
air
dickson
had
almost
fallen
asleep
when
a
smothered
exclamation
from
heritage
woke
him
to
attention
a
girl
had
appeared
in
the
verandah
above
the
parapet
he
saw
only
her
body
from
the
waist
up
she
seemed
to
be
clad
in
bright
colours
for
something
red
was
round
her
shoulders
and
her
hair
was
bound
with
an
orange
scarf
she
was
tall
that
he
could
tell
tall
and
slim
and
very
young
her
face
was
turned
seaward
and
she
stood
for
a
little
scanning
the
broad
channel
shading
her
eyes
as
if
to
search
for
something
on
the
extreme
horizon
the
air
was
very
quiet
and
he
thought
that
he
could
hear
her
sigh
then
she
turned
and
the
house
while
heritage
by
his
side
began
to
curse
under
his
breath
with
a
shocking
fervour
one
of
dickson
troubles
had
been
that
he
did
not
really
believe
dougal
story
and
the
sight
of
the
girl
removed
one
doubt
that
bright
exotic
thing
did
not
belong
to
the
cruives
or
to
scotland
at
all
and
that
she
should
be
in
the
house
removed
the
place
from
the
conventional
dwelling
to
which
the
laws
against
burglary
applied
there
was
a
rustle
among
the
rhododendrons
and
the
fiery
face
of
dougal
appeared
he
lay
between
the
other
two
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
grunted
out
his
report
after
they
had
their
dinner
dobson
and
lean
yokit
a
horse
and
went
off
to
auchenlochan
i
seen
them
pass
the
garple
brig
so
that
two
accounted
for
has
spittal
been
round
here
half
an
hour
ago
said
heritage
consulting
a
wrist
watch
it
was
him
that
keepit
me
waitin
so
long
but
he
safe
enough
now
for
five
minutes
syne
he
was
splittin
firewood
at
the
back
door
o
his
hoose
i
found
a
ladder
an
auld
yin
in
ahint
yon
lot
o
bushes
it
help
wi
the
wall
there
i
gotten
my
breath
again
and
we
can
start
the
ladder
was
fetched
by
heritage
and
proved
to
be
ancient
and
wanting
many
rungs
but
sufficient
in
length
the
three
stood
silent
for
a
moment
listening
like
stags
and
then
ran
across
the
intervening
lawn
to
the
foot
of
the
verandah
wall
dougal
went
up
first
then
heritage
and
lastly
dickson
stiff
and
giddy
from
his
long
lie
under
the
bushes
below
the
parapet
the
verandah
floor
was
heaped
with
old
garden
litter
rotten
matting
dead
or
derelict
bulbs
fibre
withies
and
strawberry
nets
it
was
dougal
intention
to
pull
up
the
ladder
and
hide
it
among
the
rubbish
against
the
hour
of
departure
but
dickson
had
barely
put
his
foot
on
the
parapet
when
there
was
a
sound
of
steps
within
the
house
approaching
the
verandah
door
the
ladder
was
left
alone
dougal
hand
brought
dickson
summarily
to
the
floor
where
he
was
fairly
well
concealed
by
a
mess
of
matting
unfortunately
his
head
was
in
the
vicinity
of
some
upturned
so
that
a
cactus
ticked
his
brow
and
a
spike
of
aloe
supported
painfully
the
back
of
his
neck
heritage
was
prone
behind
two
old
and
dougal
was
in
a
hamper
which
had
once
contained
seed
potatoes
the
house
door
had
panels
of
opaque
glass
so
the
could
not
see
the
doings
of
the
three
till
it
was
opened
and
by
that
time
all
were
in
cover
the
man
it
was
spittal
walked
rapidly
along
the
verandah
and
out
of
the
garden
door
he
was
talking
to
himself
again
and
dickson
who
had
a
glimpse
of
his
face
thought
he
looked
both
evil
and
furious
then
came
some
anxious
moments
for
had
the
man
glanced
back
when
he
was
once
outside
he
must
have
seen
the
ladder
but
he
seemed
immersed
in
his
own
reflections
for
he
hobbled
steadily
along
the
house
front
till
he
was
lost
to
sight
that
be
the
end
o
them
the
night
said
dougal
as
he
helped
heritage
to
pull
up
the
ladder
and
stow
it
away
we
got
the
place
to
oursels
now
forward
men
forward
he
tried
the
handle
of
the
house
door
and
led
the
way
in
a
narrow
paved
passage
took
them
into
what
had
once
been
the
garden
room
where
the
lady
of
the
house
had
arranged
her
flowers
and
the
tennis
racquets
and
croquet
mallets
had
been
kept
it
was
very
dusty
and
on
the
cobwebbed
walls
still
hung
a
few
soiled
garden
overalls
a
door
beyond
opened
into
a
huge
murky
hall
murky
for
the
windows
were
shuttered
and
the
only
light
came
through
things
like
far
up
in
the
wall
dougal
who
seemed
to
know
his
way
about
halted
them
stop
here
till
i
scout
a
bit
the
women
bide
in
a
wee
room
through
that
muckle
door
bare
feet
stole
across
the
oak
flooring
there
was
the
sound
of
a
door
swinging
on
its
hinges
and
then
silence
and
darkness
dickson
put
out
a
hand
for
companionship
and
clutched
heritage
to
his
surprise
it
was
cold
and
all
they
listened
for
voices
and
thought
they
could
detect
a
sob
it
was
some
minutes
before
dougal
returned
a
bonny
kettle
o
fish
he
whispered
they
both
greetin
we
just
in
time
come
on
the
pair
o
ye
through
a
green
baize
door
they
entered
a
passage
which
led
to
the
kitchen
regions
and
turned
in
at
the
first
door
on
their
right
from
its
situation
dickson
calculated
that
the
room
lay
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
house
next
to
the
verandah
the
light
was
bad
for
the
two
windows
were
partially
shuttered
but
it
had
plainly
been
a
for
there
were
by
the
hearth
and
on
the
walls
a
number
of
old
school
and
college
photographs
a
couple
of
oars
with
emblazoned
names
and
a
variety
of
stags
and
roebucks
heads
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
but
a
small
burned
inside
the
fender
in
a
chair
sat
an
elderly
woman
who
seemed
to
feel
the
cold
for
she
was
muffled
to
the
neck
in
a
fur
coat
beside
her
so
that
the
late
afternoon
light
caught
her
face
and
head
stood
a
girl
dickson
first
impression
was
of
a
tall
child
the
pose
startled
and
wild
and
yet
curiously
stiff
and
was
that
of
a
child
striving
to
remember
a
forgotten
lesson
one
hand
clutched
a
handkerchief
the
other
was
closing
and
unclosing
on
a
knob
of
the
chair
back
she
was
staring
at
dougal
who
stood
like
a
gnome
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
here
the
gentlemen
i
was
tellin
ye
about
was
his
introduction
but
her
eyes
did
not
move
then
heritage
stepped
forward
we
have
met
before
mademoiselle
he
said
do
you
remember
easter
in
in
the
house
in
the
trinit√°
dei
monte
the
girl
looked
at
him
i
do
not
remember
she
said
slowly
but
i
was
the
english
officer
who
had
the
apartments
on
the
floor
below
you
i
saw
you
every
morning
you
spoke
to
me
sometimes
you
are
a
soldier
she
asked
with
a
new
note
in
her
voice
i
was
then
till
the
war
finished
and
now
why
have
you
come
here
to
offer
you
help
if
you
need
it
if
not
to
ask
your
pardon
and
go
away
the
shrouded
figure
in
the
chair
burst
suddenly
into
rapid
hysterical
talk
in
some
foreign
tongue
which
dickson
suspected
of
being
french
heritage
replied
in
the
same
language
and
the
girl
joined
in
with
sharp
questions
then
the
poet
turned
to
dickson
this
is
my
friend
if
you
will
trust
us
we
will
do
our
best
to
save
you
the
eyes
rested
on
dickson
face
and
he
realised
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
something
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
met
in
his
life
before
it
was
a
loveliness
greater
than
he
had
imagined
was
permitted
by
the
almighty
to
his
creatures
the
little
face
was
more
square
than
oval
with
a
low
broad
brow
and
proud
exquisite
eyebrows
the
eyes
were
of
a
colour
which
he
could
never
decide
on
afterwards
he
used
to
allege
obscurely
that
they
were
the
colour
of
everything
in
spring
there
was
a
delicate
pallor
in
the
cheeks
and
the
face
bore
signs
of
suffering
and
care
possibly
even
of
hunger
but
for
all
that
there
was
youth
there
eternal
and
triumphant
not
youth
such
as
he
had
known
it
but
youth
with
all
history
behind
it
youth
with
centuries
of
command
in
its
blood
and
the
world
treasures
of
beauty
and
pride
in
its
ancestry
strange
he
thought
that
a
thing
so
fine
should
be
so
masterful
he
felt
abashed
in
every
inch
of
him
as
the
eyes
rested
on
him
their
sorrowfulness
seemed
to
be
shot
with
humour
a
ghost
of
a
smile
lurked
there
to
which
dickson
promptly
responded
he
grinned
and
bowed
very
pleased
to
meet
you
mem
i
mccunn
from
glasgow
you
do
even
know
my
name
she
said
we
do
said
heritage
they
call
me
saskia
this
nodding
to
the
chair
is
my
cousin
eug√®nie
we
are
in
very
great
trouble
but
why
should
i
tell
you
i
do
not
know
you
you
can
not
help
me
we
can
try
said
heritage
part
of
your
trouble
we
know
already
through
that
boy
you
are
imprisoned
in
this
place
by
scoundrels
we
are
here
to
help
you
to
get
out
we
want
to
ask
no
questions
only
to
do
what
you
bid
us
you
are
not
strong
enough
she
said
sadly
a
young
man
an
old
man
and
a
little
boy
there
are
many
against
us
and
any
moment
there
may
be
more
it
was
dougal
turn
to
break
in
there
lean
and
spittal
and
dobson
and
four
tinklers
in
the
dean
that
seven
but
there
us
three
and
five
more
gorbals
that
eight
there
was
something
in
the
boy
truculent
courage
that
cheered
her
i
wonder
she
said
and
her
eyes
fell
on
each
in
turn
dickson
felt
impelled
to
intervene
i
think
this
is
a
perfectly
simple
business
here
a
lady
shut
up
in
this
house
against
her
will
by
a
wheen
blagyirds
this
is
a
free
country
and
the
law
does
permit
that
my
advice
is
for
one
of
us
to
inform
the
police
at
auchenlochan
and
get
dobson
and
his
friends
took
up
and
the
lady
set
free
to
do
what
she
likes
that
is
if
these
folks
are
really
molesting
her
which
is
not
yet
quite
clear
to
my
mind
alas
it
is
not
so
simple
as
that
she
said
i
dare
not
invoke
your
english
law
for
perhaps
in
the
eyes
of
that
law
i
am
a
thief
deary
me
that
a
bad
business
said
the
startled
dickson
the
two
women
talked
together
in
some
strange
tongue
and
the
elder
appeared
to
be
pleading
and
the
younger
objecting
then
saskia
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
i
will
tell
you
all
and
she
looked
straight
at
heritage
i
do
not
think
you
would
be
cruel
or
false
for
you
have
honourable
faces
listen
then
i
am
a
russian
and
for
two
years
have
been
an
exile
i
will
not
speak
of
my
house
for
it
is
no
more
or
how
i
escaped
for
it
is
the
common
tale
of
all
of
us
i
have
seen
things
more
terrible
than
any
dream
and
yet
lived
but
i
have
paid
a
price
for
such
experience
first
i
went
to
italy
where
there
were
friends
and
i
wished
only
to
have
peace
among
kindly
people
about
poverty
i
do
not
care
for
to
us
who
have
lost
all
the
great
things
the
want
of
bread
is
a
little
matter
but
peace
was
forbidden
me
for
i
learned
that
we
russians
had
to
win
back
our
fatherland
again
and
that
the
weakest
must
work
in
that
cause
so
i
was
set
my
task
and
it
was
very
hard
there
were
jewels
which
once
belonged
to
my
emperor
they
had
been
stolen
by
the
brigands
and
must
be
recovered
there
were
others
still
hidden
in
russia
which
must
be
brought
to
a
safe
place
in
that
work
i
was
ordered
to
share
she
spoke
in
almost
perfect
english
with
a
certain
foreign
precision
suddenly
she
changed
to
french
and
talked
rapidly
to
heritage
she
has
told
me
about
her
family
he
said
turning
to
dickson
it
is
among
the
greatest
in
russia
the
very
greatest
after
the
throne
dickson
could
only
stare
our
enemies
soon
discovered
me
she
went
on
oh
but
they
are
very
clever
these
enemies
and
they
have
all
the
criminals
of
the
world
to
aid
them
here
you
do
not
understand
what
they
are
you
good
people
in
england
think
they
are
dreamers
who
are
forced
into
violence
by
the
persecution
of
western
europe
but
you
are
wrong
some
honest
fools
there
are
among
them
but
the
power
the
true
power
lies
with
madmen
and
degenerates
and
they
have
for
allies
the
special
devil
that
dwells
in
each
country
that
is
why
they
cast
their
net
as
wide
as
mankind
she
shivered
and
for
a
second
her
face
wore
a
look
which
dickson
never
forgot
the
look
of
one
who
has
looked
over
the
edge
of
life
into
the
outer
dark
there
were
certain
jewels
of
great
price
which
were
about
to
be
turned
into
guns
and
armies
for
our
enemies
these
our
people
recovered
and
the
charge
of
them
was
laid
on
me
who
would
suspect
they
said
a
foolish
girl
but
our
enemies
were
very
clever
and
soon
the
hunt
was
cried
against
me
they
tried
to
rob
me
of
them
but
they
failed
for
i
too
had
become
clever
then
they
asked
the
help
of
the
law
first
in
italy
and
then
in
france
oh
it
was
subtly
done
respectable
bourgeois
who
hated
the
bolsheviki
but
had
bought
long
ago
the
bonds
of
my
country
desired
to
be
repaid
their
debts
out
of
the
property
of
the
russian
crown
which
might
be
found
in
the
west
but
behind
them
were
the
jews
and
behind
the
jews
our
unsleeping
enemies
once
i
was
enmeshed
in
the
law
i
would
be
safe
for
them
and
presently
they
would
find
the
of
the
treasure
and
while
the
bourgeois
were
clamouring
in
the
courts
it
would
be
safe
in
their
pockets
so
i
fled
for
months
i
have
been
fleeing
and
hiding
they
have
tried
to
kidnap
me
many
times
and
once
they
have
tried
to
kill
me
but
i
too
have
become
very
clever
oh
very
clever
and
i
have
learned
not
to
fear
this
simple
recital
affected
dickson
honest
soul
with
the
liveliest
indignation
sich
doings
he
exclaimed
and
he
could
not
forbear
from
whispering
to
heritage
an
extract
from
that
gentleman
conversation
the
first
night
at
kirkmichael
we
need
imitate
all
their
methods
but
they
got
hold
of
the
right
end
of
the
stick
they
seek
truth
and
reality
the
reply
from
the
poet
was
an
angry
shrug
why
and
how
did
you
come
here
he
asked
i
always
meant
to
come
to
england
for
i
thought
it
the
sanest
place
in
a
mad
world
also
it
is
a
good
country
to
hide
in
for
it
is
apart
from
europe
and
your
police
as
i
thought
do
not
permit
evil
men
to
be
their
own
law
but
especially
i
had
a
friend
a
scottish
gentleman
whom
i
knew
in
the
days
when
we
russians
were
still
a
nation
i
saw
him
again
in
italy
and
since
he
was
kind
and
brave
i
told
him
some
part
of
my
troubles
he
was
called
quentin
kennedy
and
now
he
is
dead
he
told
me
that
in
scotland
he
had
a
lonely
ch√¢teau
where
i
could
hide
secretly
and
safely
and
against
the
day
when
i
might
be
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
his
steward
bidding
him
welcome
me
as
a
guest
when
i
made
application
at
that
time
i
did
not
think
i
would
need
such
sanctuary
but
a
month
ago
the
need
became
urgent
for
the
hunt
in
france
was
very
close
on
me
so
i
sent
a
message
to
the
steward
as
captain
kennedy
told
me
what
is
his
name
heritage
asked
she
spelt
it
monsieur
loudon
in
the
town
of
auchenlochan
the
factor
said
dickson
and
what
then
some
spy
must
have
found
me
out
i
had
a
letter
from
this
loudon
bidding
me
come
to
auchenlochan
there
i
found
no
steward
to
receive
me
but
another
letter
saying
that
that
night
a
carriage
would
be
in
waiting
to
bring
me
here
it
was
midnight
when
we
arrived
and
we
were
brought
in
by
strange
ways
to
this
house
with
no
light
but
a
single
candle
here
we
were
welcomed
indeed
but
by
an
enemy
which
asked
heritage
dobson
or
lean
or
spittal
dobson
i
do
not
know
l√©on
was
there
he
is
no
russian
but
a
belgian
who
was
a
valet
in
my
father
service
till
he
joined
the
bolsheviki
next
day
the
lett
spidel
came
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
very
truth
entrapped
for
of
all
our
enemies
he
is
save
one
the
most
subtle
and
unwearied
her
voice
had
trailed
off
into
flat
weariness
again
dickson
was
reminded
of
a
child
for
her
arms
hung
limp
by
her
side
and
her
slim
figure
in
its
odd
clothes
was
curiously
like
that
of
a
boy
in
a
school
blazer
another
resemblance
perplexed
him
she
had
a
hint
of
janet
about
the
mouth
janet
that
solemn
little
girl
those
twenty
years
in
her
grave
heritage
was
wrinkling
his
brows
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
the
jewels
you
have
them
with
you
she
nodded
these
men
wanted
to
rob
you
why
did
they
do
it
between
here
and
auchenlochan
you
had
no
chance
to
hide
them
on
the
journey
why
did
they
let
you
come
here
where
you
were
in
a
better
position
to
baffle
them
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
explain
except
perhaps
that
spidel
had
not
arrived
that
night
and
l√©on
may
have
been
waiting
instructions
the
other
still
looked
dissatisfied
they
are
either
clumsier
villains
than
i
take
them
to
be
or
there
is
something
deeper
in
the
business
than
we
understand
these
jewels
are
they
here
his
tone
was
so
sharp
that
she
looked
startled
almost
suspicious
then
she
saw
that
in
his
face
which
reassured
her
i
have
them
hidden
here
i
have
grown
very
skilful
in
hiding
things
have
they
searched
for
them
the
first
day
they
demanded
them
of
me
i
denied
all
knowledge
then
they
ransacked
this
house
i
think
they
ransack
it
daily
but
i
am
too
clever
for
them
i
am
not
allowed
to
go
beyond
the
verandah
and
when
at
first
i
disobeyed
there
was
always
one
of
them
in
wait
to
force
me
back
with
a
pistol
behind
my
head
every
morning
l√©on
brings
us
food
for
the
day
good
food
but
not
enough
so
that
cousin
eug√®nie
is
always
hungry
and
each
day
he
and
spidel
question
and
threaten
me
this
afternoon
spidel
has
told
me
that
their
patience
is
at
an
end
he
has
given
me
till
at
noon
to
produce
the
jewels
if
not
he
says
i
will
die
mercy
on
us
dickson
exclaimed
there
will
be
no
mercy
for
us
she
said
solemnly
he
and
his
kind
think
as
little
of
shedding
blood
as
of
spilling
water
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
kill
me
i
think
i
will
kill
him
first
but
after
that
i
shall
surely
die
as
for
cousin
eug√®nie
i
do
not
know
her
level
tone
seemed
to
dickson
most
shocking
for
he
could
not
treat
it
as
mere
melodrama
it
carried
a
horrid
conviction
we
must
get
you
out
of
this
at
once
he
declared
i
can
not
leave
i
will
tell
you
why
when
i
came
to
this
country
i
appointed
one
to
meet
me
here
he
is
a
kinsman
who
knows
england
well
for
he
fought
in
your
army
with
him
by
my
side
i
have
no
fear
it
is
altogether
needful
that
i
wait
for
him
then
there
is
something
more
which
you
have
told
us
heritage
asked
was
there
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
blush
on
her
cheek
there
is
something
more
she
said
she
spoke
to
heritage
in
french
and
dickson
caught
the
name
alexis
and
a
word
which
sounded
like
prance
the
poet
listened
eagerly
and
nodded
i
have
heard
of
him
he
said
but
have
you
not
seen
him
a
tall
man
with
a
yellow
beard
who
bears
himself
proudly
being
of
my
mother
race
he
has
eyes
like
mine
that
the
man
she
was
askin
me
about
yesterday
said
dougal
who
had
squatted
on
the
floor
heritage
shook
his
head
we
only
came
here
last
night
when
did
you
expect
prince
your
friend
i
hoped
to
find
him
here
before
me
oh
it
is
his
not
coming
that
terrifies
me
i
must
wait
and
hope
but
if
he
does
not
come
in
time
another
may
come
before
him
the
ones
already
here
are
not
all
the
enemies
that
threaten
you
indeed
no
the
worst
has
still
to
come
and
till
i
know
he
is
here
i
do
not
greatly
fear
spidel
or
l√©on
they
receive
orders
and
do
not
give
them
heritage
ran
a
perplexed
hand
through
his
hair
the
sunset
which
had
been
flaming
for
some
time
in
the
unshuttered
panes
was
now
passing
into
the
dark
the
girl
lit
a
lamp
after
first
shuttering
the
rest
of
the
windows
as
she
turned
it
up
the
odd
dusty
room
and
its
strange
company
were
revealed
more
clearly
and
dickson
saw
with
a
shock
how
haggard
was
the
beautiful
face
a
great
pity
seized
him
and
almost
conquered
his
timidity
it
is
very
difficult
to
help
you
heritage
was
saying
you
leave
this
place
and
you
wo
claim
the
protection
of
the
law
you
are
very
independent
mademoiselle
but
it
ca
go
on
for
ever
the
man
you
fear
may
arrive
at
any
moment
at
any
moment
too
your
treasure
may
be
discovered
it
is
that
that
weighs
on
me
she
cried
the
jewels
they
are
my
solemn
trust
but
they
burden
me
terribly
if
i
were
only
rid
of
them
and
knew
them
to
be
safe
i
should
face
the
rest
with
a
braver
mind
if
you
take
my
advice
said
dickson
slowly
you
get
them
deposited
in
a
bank
and
take
a
receipt
for
them
a
scotch
bank
is
no
in
a
hurry
to
surrender
a
deposit
without
it
gets
the
proper
authority
heritage
brought
his
hands
together
with
a
smack
that
an
idea
will
you
trust
us
to
take
these
things
and
deposit
them
safely
for
a
little
she
was
silent
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
each
of
the
trio
in
turn
i
will
trust
you
she
said
at
last
i
think
you
will
not
betray
me
by
god
we
wo
said
the
poet
fervently
dogson
it
up
to
you
you
march
off
to
glasgow
in
double
quick
time
and
place
the
stuff
in
your
own
name
in
your
own
bank
there
not
a
moment
to
lose
hear
i
will
that
to
his
own
surprise
dickson
spoke
without
hesitation
partly
it
was
because
of
his
merchant
sense
of
property
which
made
him
hate
the
thought
that
miscreants
should
acquire
that
to
which
they
had
no
title
but
mainly
it
was
the
appeal
in
those
haggard
childish
eyes
but
i
not
going
to
be
tramping
the
country
in
the
night
carrying
a
fortune
and
seeking
for
trains
that
are
there
i
go
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
where
are
they
heritage
asked
that
i
do
not
tell
but
i
will
fetch
them
she
left
the
room
and
presently
returned
with
three
odd
little
parcels
wrapped
in
leather
and
tied
with
thongs
of
raw
hide
she
gave
them
to
heritage
who
held
them
appraisingly
in
his
hand
and
then
passed
them
to
dickson
i
do
not
ask
about
their
contents
we
take
them
from
you
as
they
are
and
please
god
when
the
moment
comes
they
will
be
returned
to
you
as
you
gave
them
you
trust
us
mademoiselle
i
trust
you
for
you
are
a
soldier
oh
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
my
friends
she
held
out
a
hand
to
each
which
caused
heritage
to
grow
suddenly
very
red
i
will
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
to
await
developments
he
said
we
had
better
leave
you
now
dougal
lead
on
before
going
he
took
the
girl
hand
again
and
with
a
sudden
movement
bent
and
kissed
it
dickson
shook
it
heartily
cheer
up
mem
he
observed
there
a
better
time
coming
his
last
recollection
of
her
eyes
was
of
a
soft
mistiness
not
far
from
tears
his
pouch
and
pipe
had
strange
company
jostling
them
in
his
pocket
as
he
followed
the
others
down
the
ladder
into
the
night
dougal
insisted
that
they
must
return
by
the
road
of
the
morning
we
dare
go
by
the
laver
for
that
would
bring
us
by
the
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
we
fall
in
wi
any
of
the
deevils
they
must
think
ye
changed
your
mind
and
come
back
from
auchenlochan
the
night
smelt
fresh
and
moist
as
if
a
break
in
the
weather
were
imminent
as
they
scrambled
along
the
garple
dean
a
pinprick
of
light
below
showed
where
the
tinklers
were
busy
by
their
fire
spirits
suffered
a
sharp
fall
and
he
began
to
marvel
at
his
temerity
what
in
heaven
name
had
he
undertaken
to
carry
very
precious
things
to
which
certainly
he
had
no
right
through
the
enemy
to
distant
glasgow
how
could
he
escape
the
notice
of
the
watchers
he
was
already
suspect
and
the
sight
of
him
back
again
in
dalquharter
would
double
that
suspicion
he
must
brazen
it
out
but
he
distrusted
his
powers
with
such
stuff
in
his
pockets
they
might
murder
him
anywhere
on
the
moor
road
or
in
an
empty
railway
carriage
an
unpleasant
memory
of
various
novels
he
had
read
in
which
such
things
happened
haunted
his
mind
there
was
just
one
consolation
this
job
over
he
would
be
quit
of
the
whole
business
and
honourably
quit
too
for
he
would
have
played
a
manly
part
in
a
most
unpleasant
affair
he
could
retire
to
the
idyllic
with
the
knowledge
that
he
had
not
been
wanting
when
romance
called
not
a
soul
should
ever
hear
of
it
but
he
saw
himself
in
the
future
tramping
green
roads
or
sitting
by
his
winter
fireside
pleasantly
retelling
himself
the
tale
before
they
came
to
the
garple
bridge
dougal
insisted
that
they
should
separate
remarking
that
it
would
never
do
if
we
were
seen
thegither
heritage
was
despatched
by
a
short
cut
over
fields
to
the
left
which
eventually
after
one
or
two
plunges
into
ditches
landed
him
safely
in
morran
back
yard
dickson
and
dougal
crossed
the
bridge
and
tramped
by
the
highway
there
was
no
sign
of
human
life
in
that
quiet
place
with
owls
hooting
and
rabbits
rustling
in
the
undergrowth
beyond
the
woods
they
came
in
sight
of
the
light
in
the
back
kitchen
and
both
seemed
to
relax
their
watchfulness
when
it
was
most
needed
dougal
sniffed
the
air
and
looked
seaward
it
coming
on
to
rain
he
observed
there
should
be
a
muckle
star
there
and
when
you
ca
see
it
it
means
wet
weather
wi
this
wind
what
star
dickson
asked
the
one
wi
the
name
what
that
they
call
it
and
he
pointed
to
where
the
constellation
of
the
hunter
should
have
been
declining
on
the
western
horizon
there
was
a
bend
of
the
road
behind
them
and
suddenly
round
it
came
a
dogcart
driven
rapidly
dougal
slipped
like
a
weasel
into
a
bush
and
presently
dickson
stood
revealed
in
the
glare
of
a
lamp
the
horse
was
pulled
up
sharply
and
the
driver
called
out
to
him
he
saw
that
it
was
dobson
the
innkeeper
with
l√©on
beside
him
who
is
it
cried
the
voice
oh
you
i
thought
ye
were
off
the
day
dickson
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
i
thought
myself
i
was
but
i
did
think
much
of
auchenlochan
and
i
took
a
fancy
to
come
back
and
spend
the
last
night
of
my
holiday
with
my
auntie
i
off
to
glasgow
first
thing
the
morn
morn
so
said
the
voice
queer
thing
i
never
saw
ye
on
the
auchenlochan
road
where
ye
can
see
three
mile
before
ye
i
left
early
and
took
it
easy
along
the
shore
did
ye
so
well
to
ye
five
minutes
later
dickson
walked
into
morran
kitchen
where
heritage
was
busy
making
up
for
a
day
of
short
provender
i
for
glasgow
auntie
phemie
he
cried
i
want
you
to
loan
me
a
wee
trunk
with
a
key
and
steek
the
doors
and
windows
for
i
a
lot
to
tell
you
chapter
vi
how
mccunn
departed
with
relief
and
returned
with
resolution
at
seven
on
the
following
morning
the
summoned
by
an
early
message
from
morran
appeared
outside
the
cottage
in
it
sat
the
ancient
postman
whose
real
home
was
auchenlochan
but
who
slept
alternate
nights
in
dalquharter
and
beside
him
dobson
the
innkeeper
dickson
and
his
hostess
stood
at
the
the
former
with
his
pack
on
his
back
and
at
his
feet
a
small
stout
wooden
box
of
the
kind
in
which
cheeses
are
transported
garnished
with
an
immense
padlock
heritage
for
obvious
reasons
did
not
appear
at
the
moment
he
was
crouched
on
the
floor
of
the
loft
watching
the
departure
through
a
gap
in
the
dimity
curtains
the
traveller
after
making
sure
that
dobson
was
looking
furtively
slipped
the
key
of
the
trunk
into
his
knapsack
well
auntie
phemie
he
said
i
sure
you
been
awful
kind
to
me
and
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
all
you
sending
tuts
dickson
my
man
they
hungry
folk
about
glesca
that
be
glad
o
my
scones
and
jeelie
tell
mirren
i
rale
pleased
wi
her
man
and
haste
ye
back
soon
the
trunk
was
deposited
on
the
floor
of
the
cart
and
dickson
clambered
into
the
back
seat
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
not
to
sit
next
to
dobson
for
he
had
stuff
on
his
person
the
morning
was
wet
so
he
wore
his
waterproof
which
concealed
his
odd
tendency
to
stoutness
about
the
middle
morran
played
her
part
well
with
all
the
becoming
gravity
of
an
affectionate
aunt
but
so
soon
as
the
turned
the
bend
of
the
road
her
demeanour
changed
she
was
torn
with
convulsions
of
silent
laughter
she
retreated
to
the
kitchen
sank
into
a
chair
wrapped
her
face
in
her
apron
and
rocked
heritage
descending
found
her
struggling
to
regain
composure
d
ken
his
wife
name
she
gasped
i
her
mirren
and
maybe
the
body
no
mairried
hech
sirs
hech
sirs
meantime
dickson
was
bumping
along
the
on
the
back
of
the
he
had
worked
out
a
plan
just
as
he
had
been
used
aforetime
to
devise
a
deal
in
foodstuffs
he
had
expected
one
of
the
watchers
to
turn
up
and
was
rather
relieved
that
it
should
be
dobson
whom
he
regarded
as
the
most
natural
beast
of
the
three
somehow
he
did
not
think
that
he
would
be
molested
before
he
reached
the
station
since
his
enemies
would
still
be
undecided
in
their
minds
probably
they
only
wanted
to
make
sure
that
he
had
really
departed
to
forget
all
about
him
but
if
not
he
had
his
plan
ready
are
you
travelling
he
asked
the
innkeeper
just
as
far
as
the
station
to
see
about
some
i
expectin
what
in
your
wee
kist
ye
came
here
wi
nothing
but
the
bag
on
your
back
ay
the
kist
is
no
mine
it
my
auntie
she
a
kind
body
and
nothing
would
serve
but
she
must
pack
a
box
for
me
to
take
back
let
me
see
there
a
baking
of
scones
three
pots
of
honey
and
one
of
rhubarb
jam
she
was
aye
famous
for
her
rhubarb
jam
a
mutton
ham
which
you
ca
get
for
love
or
money
in
glasgow
some
black
puddings
and
a
wee
cheese
i
doubt
i
have
to
take
a
cab
from
the
station
dobson
appeared
satisfied
lit
a
short
pipe
and
relapsed
into
meditation
the
long
uphill
road
ever
climbing
to
where
far
off
showed
the
tiny
whitewashed
buildings
which
were
the
railway
station
seemed
interminable
this
morning
the
aged
postman
addressed
strange
objurgations
to
his
aged
horse
and
muttered
reflections
to
himself
the
innkeeper
smoked
and
dickson
stared
back
into
the
misty
hollow
where
lay
dalquharter
the
wind
had
brought
up
a
screen
of
rain
clouds
and
washed
all
the
countryside
in
a
soft
wet
grey
but
the
eye
could
still
travel
a
fair
distance
and
dickson
thought
he
had
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
on
a
bicycle
leaving
the
village
two
miles
back
he
wondered
who
it
could
be
not
heritage
who
had
no
bicycle
perhaps
some
woman
who
was
conspicuously
late
for
the
train
women
were
the
chief
cyclists
nowadays
in
country
places
then
he
forgot
about
the
bicycle
and
twisted
his
neck
to
watch
the
station
it
was
less
than
a
mile
off
now
and
they
had
no
time
to
spare
for
away
to
the
south
among
the
hummocks
of
the
bog
he
saw
the
smoke
of
the
train
coming
from
auchenlochan
the
postman
also
saw
it
and
whipped
up
his
beast
into
a
clumsy
canter
dickson
always
nervous
about
being
late
for
trains
forced
his
eyes
away
and
regarded
again
the
road
behind
them
suddenly
the
cyclist
had
become
quite
plain
a
little
more
than
a
mile
behind
a
man
and
pedalling
furiously
in
spite
of
the
stiff
ascent
it
could
only
be
one
person
l√©on
he
must
have
discovered
their
visit
to
the
house
yesterday
and
be
on
the
way
to
warn
dobson
if
he
reached
the
station
before
the
train
there
would
be
no
journey
to
glasgow
that
day
for
one
respectable
citizen
dickson
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
and
fright
he
dared
not
abjure
the
postman
to
hurry
lest
dobson
should
turn
his
head
and
descry
his
colleague
but
that
ancient
man
had
begun
to
realise
the
shortness
of
time
and
was
urging
the
cart
along
at
a
fair
pace
since
they
were
now
on
the
flatter
shelf
of
land
which
carried
the
railway
dickson
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
bicycle
and
his
teeth
shut
tight
on
his
lower
lip
now
it
was
hidden
by
the
last
dip
of
hill
now
it
emerged
into
view
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
and
its
rider
gave
vent
to
a
shrill
call
luckily
the
innkeeper
did
not
hear
for
at
that
moment
with
a
jolt
the
cart
pulled
up
at
the
station
door
accompanied
by
the
roar
of
the
incoming
train
dickson
whipped
down
from
the
back
seat
and
seized
the
solitary
porter
label
the
box
for
glasgow
and
into
the
van
with
it
quick
man
and
there
be
a
shilling
for
you
he
had
been
doing
some
rapid
thinking
these
last
minutes
and
had
made
up
his
mind
if
dobson
and
he
were
alone
in
a
carriage
he
could
not
have
the
box
there
that
must
be
elsewhere
so
that
dobson
could
not
examine
it
if
he
were
set
on
violence
somewhere
in
which
it
could
still
be
a
focus
of
suspicion
and
attract
attention
from
his
person
he
took
his
ticket
and
rushed
on
to
the
platform
to
find
the
porter
and
the
box
at
the
door
of
the
guard
van
dobson
was
not
there
with
the
vigour
of
a
fussy
traveller
he
shouted
directions
to
the
guard
to
take
good
care
of
his
luggage
hurled
a
shilling
at
the
porter
and
ran
for
a
carriage
at
that
moment
he
became
aware
of
dobson
hurrying
through
the
entrance
he
must
have
met
l√©on
and
heard
news
from
him
for
his
face
was
red
and
his
ugly
brows
darkening
the
train
was
in
motion
here
you
dobson
voice
shouted
stop
i
want
a
word
wi
ye
dickson
plunged
at
a
carriage
for
he
saw
faces
behind
the
misty
panes
and
above
all
things
then
he
feared
an
empty
compartment
he
clambered
on
to
the
step
but
the
handle
would
not
turn
and
with
a
sharp
pang
of
fear
he
felt
the
innkeeper
grip
on
his
arm
then
some
samaritan
from
within
let
down
the
window
opened
the
door
and
pulled
him
up
he
fell
on
a
seat
and
a
second
later
dobson
staggered
in
beside
him
thank
heaven
the
dirty
little
carriage
was
nearly
full
there
were
two
herds
each
with
a
dog
and
a
long
hazel
crook
and
an
elderly
woman
who
looked
like
a
ploughman
wife
out
for
a
day
marketing
and
there
was
one
other
whom
dickson
recognised
with
a
peculiar
joy
the
bagman
in
the
provision
line
of
business
whom
he
had
met
three
days
before
at
kilchrist
the
recognition
was
mutual
mr
mccunn
the
bagman
exclaimed
my
but
that
was
running
it
fine
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
holiday
sir
very
pleasant
i
been
spending
two
nights
with
friends
down
hereaways
i
been
very
fortunate
in
the
weather
for
it
has
broke
just
when
i
leaving
dickson
sank
back
on
the
hard
cushions
it
had
been
a
near
thing
but
so
far
he
had
won
he
wished
his
heart
did
not
beat
so
fast
and
he
hoped
he
did
not
betray
his
disorder
in
his
face
very
deliberately
he
hunted
for
his
pipe
and
filled
it
slowly
then
he
turned
to
dobson
i
know
you
were
travelling
the
day
what
about
your
i
changed
my
mind
was
the
gruff
answer
was
that
you
i
heard
crying
on
me
when
we
were
running
for
the
train
ay
i
thought
ye
had
forgot
about
your
kist
no
fear
said
dickson
i
no
likely
to
forget
my
auntie
scones
he
laughed
pleasantly
and
then
turned
to
the
bagman
thereafter
the
compartment
hummed
with
the
technicalities
of
the
grocery
trade
he
exerted
himself
to
draw
out
his
companion
to
have
him
refer
to
the
great
firm
of
mccunn
so
that
the
innkeeper
might
be
ashamed
of
his
suspicions
what
nonsense
to
imagine
that
a
noted
and
wealthy
glasgow
merchant
the
bagman
tone
was
almost
reverential
would
concern
himself
with
the
affairs
of
a
forgotten
village
and
a
tumbledown
house
presently
the
train
drew
up
at
kirkmichael
station
the
woman
descended
and
dobson
after
making
sure
that
no
one
else
meant
to
follow
her
example
also
left
the
carriage
a
porter
was
shouting
fast
train
to
glasgow
glasgow
next
stop
dickson
watched
the
innkeeper
shoulder
his
way
through
the
crowd
in
the
direction
of
the
booking
office
he
off
to
send
a
telegram
he
decided
there
be
trouble
waiting
for
me
at
the
other
end
when
the
train
moved
on
he
found
himself
disinclined
for
further
talk
he
had
suddenly
become
meditative
and
curled
up
in
a
corner
with
his
head
hard
against
the
window
pane
watching
the
wet
fields
and
glistening
roads
as
they
slipped
past
he
had
his
plans
made
for
his
conduct
at
glasgow
but
lord
how
he
loathed
the
whole
business
last
night
he
had
had
a
kind
of
gusto
in
his
desire
to
circumvent
villainy
at
dalquharter
station
he
had
enjoyed
a
momentary
sense
of
triumph
now
he
felt
very
small
lonely
and
forlorn
only
one
thought
far
at
the
back
of
his
mind
cropped
up
now
and
then
to
give
him
comfort
he
was
entering
on
the
last
lap
once
get
this
detestable
errand
done
and
he
would
be
a
free
man
free
to
go
back
to
the
kindly
humdrum
life
from
which
he
should
never
have
strayed
never
again
he
vowed
never
again
rather
would
he
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
hydropathics
than
come
within
the
pale
of
such
horrible
adventures
romance
forsooth
this
was
not
the
mild
goddess
he
had
sought
but
an
awful
harpy
who
battened
on
the
souls
of
men
he
had
some
bad
minutes
as
the
train
passed
through
the
suburbs
and
along
the
grimy
embankment
by
which
the
southern
lines
enter
the
city
but
as
it
rumbled
over
the
river
bridge
and
slowed
down
before
the
terminus
his
vitality
suddenly
revived
he
was
a
business
man
and
there
was
now
something
for
him
to
do
after
a
rapid
farewell
to
the
bagman
he
found
a
porter
and
hustled
his
box
out
of
the
van
in
the
direction
of
the
office
spies
summoned
by
dobson
telegram
were
he
was
convinced
watching
his
every
movement
and
he
meant
to
see
that
they
missed
nothing
he
received
his
ticket
for
the
box
and
slowly
and
ostentatiously
stowed
it
away
in
his
pack
swinging
the
said
pack
on
his
arm
he
sauntered
through
the
entrance
hall
to
the
row
of
waiting
and
selected
that
one
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
the
oldest
and
most
doddering
driver
he
deposited
the
pack
inside
on
the
seat
and
then
stood
still
as
if
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
i
breakfasted
terrible
early
he
told
the
driver
i
think
i
have
a
bite
to
eat
will
you
wait
ay
said
the
man
who
was
reading
a
grubby
sheet
of
newspaper
wait
as
long
as
ye
like
for
it
you
that
pays
dickson
left
his
pack
in
the
cab
and
oddly
enough
for
a
careful
man
he
did
not
shut
the
door
he
the
station
strolled
to
the
bookstall
and
bought
a
his
steps
then
tended
to
the
refreshment
room
where
he
ordered
a
cup
of
coffee
and
two
bath
buns
and
seated
himself
at
a
small
table
there
he
was
soon
immersed
in
the
financial
news
and
though
he
sipped
his
coffee
he
left
the
buns
untasted
he
took
out
a
penknife
and
cut
various
extracts
from
the
bestowing
them
carefully
in
his
pocket
an
observer
would
have
seen
an
elderly
gentleman
absorbed
in
market
quotations
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
been
spent
in
this
performance
he
happened
to
glance
at
the
clock
and
rose
with
an
exclamation
he
bustled
out
to
his
taxi
and
found
the
driver
still
intent
upon
his
reading
here
i
am
at
last
he
said
cheerily
and
had
a
foot
on
the
step
when
he
stopped
suddenly
with
a
cry
it
was
a
cry
of
alarm
but
also
of
satisfaction
what
become
of
my
pack
i
left
it
on
the
seat
and
now
it
gone
there
been
a
thief
here
the
driver
roused
from
his
lethargy
protested
in
the
name
of
his
gods
that
no
one
had
been
near
it
ye
took
it
into
the
station
wi
ye
he
urged
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
just
you
wait
here
till
i
see
the
inspector
a
bonny
watch
keep
on
a
gentleman
things
but
dickson
did
not
interview
the
railway
authorities
instead
he
hurried
to
the
office
i
deposited
a
small
box
here
a
short
time
ago
i
mind
the
number
is
it
there
still
the
attendant
glanced
at
a
shelf
a
wee
deal
box
with
iron
bands
it
was
took
out
ten
minutes
syne
a
man
brought
the
ticket
and
took
it
away
on
his
shoulder
thank
you
there
been
a
mistake
but
the
blame
mine
my
man
mistook
my
orders
then
he
returned
to
the
now
nervous
i
taken
it
up
with
the
and
he
putting
the
police
on
you
likely
be
wanted
so
i
gave
him
your
number
it
a
fair
disgrace
that
there
should
be
so
many
thieves
about
this
station
it
not
the
first
time
i
lost
things
drive
me
to
west
george
street
and
look
sharp
and
he
slammed
the
door
with
the
violence
of
an
angry
man
but
his
reflections
were
not
violent
for
he
smiled
to
himself
that
was
pretty
neat
they
take
some
time
to
get
the
kist
open
for
i
dropped
the
key
out
of
the
train
after
we
left
kirkmichael
that
gives
me
a
fair
start
if
i
had
thought
of
that
they
have
found
some
way
to
grip
me
and
ripe
me
long
before
i
got
to
the
bank
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
the
dangers
he
had
escaped
as
it
is
they
off
the
track
for
half
an
hour
at
least
while
they
rummaging
among
auntie
phemie
scones
at
the
thought
he
laughed
heartily
and
when
he
brought
the
to
a
standstill
by
rapping
on
the
front
window
he
left
it
with
a
temper
apparently
restored
obviously
he
had
no
grudge
against
the
driver
who
to
his
immense
surprise
was
rewarded
with
ten
shillings
three
minutes
later
mccunn
might
have
been
seen
entering
the
head
office
of
the
strathclyde
bank
and
inquiring
for
the
manager
there
was
no
hesitation
about
him
now
for
his
foot
was
on
his
native
heath
the
chief
cashier
received
him
with
deference
in
spite
of
his
unorthodox
garb
for
he
was
not
the
least
honoured
of
the
customers
as
it
chanced
he
had
been
talking
about
him
that
very
morning
to
a
gentleman
from
london
the
strength
of
this
city
he
had
said
tapping
his
eyeglasses
on
his
knuckles
does
not
lie
in
its
dozen
very
rich
men
but
in
the
hundred
or
two
homely
folk
who
make
no
parade
of
wealth
men
like
dickson
mccunn
for
example
who
live
all
their
life
in
a
villa
and
die
worth
half
a
million
and
the
londoner
had
cordially
assented
so
dickson
was
ushered
promptly
into
an
inner
room
and
was
warmly
greeted
by
mackintosh
the
patron
of
the
gorbals
i
must
thank
you
for
your
generous
donation
mccunn
those
boys
will
get
a
little
fresh
air
and
quiet
after
the
smoke
and
din
of
glasgow
a
little
country
peace
to
smooth
out
the
creases
in
their
poor
little
souls
maybe
said
dickson
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
dougal
as
he
had
last
seen
him
somehow
he
did
not
think
that
peace
was
likely
to
be
the
portion
of
that
devoted
band
but
i
not
come
here
to
speak
about
that
he
took
off
his
waterproof
then
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
showed
himself
a
strange
figure
with
sundry
bulges
about
the
middle
the
manager
eyes
grew
very
round
presently
these
excrescences
were
revealed
as
linen
bags
sewn
on
to
his
shirt
and
fitting
into
the
hollow
between
ribs
and
hip
with
some
difficulty
he
slit
the
bags
and
extracted
three
packages
see
here
mackintosh
he
said
solemnly
i
hand
you
over
these
parcels
and
you
to
put
them
in
the
innermost
corner
of
your
strong
room
you
need
open
them
just
put
them
away
as
they
are
and
write
me
a
receipt
for
them
write
it
now
mackintosh
obediently
took
pen
in
hand
what
i
call
them
he
asked
just
the
three
leather
parcels
handed
to
you
by
dickson
mccunn
naming
the
date
mackintosh
wrote
he
signed
his
name
with
his
usual
flourish
and
handed
the
slip
to
his
client
now
said
dickson
you
put
that
receipt
in
the
strong
box
where
you
keep
my
securities
and
you
give
it
up
to
nobody
but
me
in
person
and
you
surrender
the
parcels
only
on
presentation
of
the
receipt
understand
perfectly
may
i
ask
any
questions
you
better
not
if
you
do
want
to
hear
lees
what
in
the
packages
mackintosh
weighed
them
in
his
hand
that
asking
said
dickson
but
i
tell
ye
this
much
it
jools
your
own
no
but
i
their
trustee
valuable
i
was
hearing
they
were
worth
more
than
a
million
pounds
god
bless
my
soul
said
the
startled
manager
i
do
like
this
kind
of
business
mccunn
no
more
do
i
but
you
do
it
to
oblige
an
old
friend
and
a
good
customer
if
you
do
know
much
about
the
packages
you
know
all
about
me
now
mind
i
trust
you
mackintosh
forced
himself
to
a
joke
did
you
maybe
steal
them
dickson
grinned
just
what
i
did
and
that
being
so
i
want
you
to
let
me
out
by
the
back
door
when
he
found
himself
in
the
street
he
felt
the
huge
relief
of
a
boy
who
had
emerged
with
credit
from
the
dentist
chair
remembering
that
there
would
be
no
midday
dinner
for
him
at
home
his
first
step
was
to
feed
heavily
at
a
restaurant
he
had
so
far
as
he
could
see
surmounted
all
his
troubles
his
one
regret
being
that
he
had
lost
his
pack
which
contained
among
other
things
his
and
his
safety
razor
he
bought
another
razor
and
a
new
walton
and
mounted
an
electric
for
home
very
contented
with
himself
he
felt
as
the
car
swung
across
the
clyde
bridge
he
had
done
well
but
of
that
he
did
not
want
to
think
for
the
whole
beastly
thing
was
over
he
was
going
to
bury
that
memory
to
be
resurrected
perhaps
on
a
later
day
when
the
unpleasantness
had
been
forgotten
heritage
had
his
address
and
knew
where
to
come
when
it
was
time
to
claim
the
jewels
as
for
the
watchers
they
must
have
ceased
to
suspect
him
when
they
discovered
the
innocent
contents
of
his
knapsack
and
morran
box
home
for
him
and
a
luxurious
tea
by
his
own
fireside
and
then
an
evening
with
his
books
for
heritage
nonsense
had
stimulated
his
literary
fervour
he
would
dip
into
his
old
favourites
again
to
confirm
his
faith
he
would
go
for
a
jaunt
somewhere
perhaps
down
the
clyde
or
to
the
south
of
england
which
he
had
heard
was
a
pleasant
thickly
peopled
country
no
more
lonely
inns
and
deserted
villages
for
him
henceforth
he
would
make
certain
of
comfort
and
peace
the
rain
had
stopped
and
as
the
car
moved
down
the
dreary
vista
of
eglinton
street
the
sky
opened
into
fields
of
blue
and
the
april
sun
silvered
the
puddles
it
was
in
such
place
and
under
such
weather
that
dickson
suffered
an
overwhelming
experience
it
is
beyond
my
skill
being
all
unlearned
in
the
game
of
to
explain
how
this
thing
happened
i
concern
myself
only
with
facts
suddenly
the
pretty
veil
of
was
rent
from
top
to
bottom
and
dickson
saw
a
figure
of
himself
within
a
smug
leaden
little
figure
which
simpered
and
preened
itself
and
was
hollow
as
a
rotten
nut
and
he
hated
it
the
horrid
truth
burst
on
him
that
heritage
had
been
right
he
only
played
with
life
that
imbecile
image
was
a
mere
spectator
content
to
applaud
but
shrinking
from
the
contact
of
reality
it
had
been
all
right
as
a
provision
merchant
but
when
it
fancied
itself
capable
of
higher
things
it
had
deceived
itself
foolish
little
image
with
its
brave
dreams
and
its
swelling
words
from
browning
all
of
the
feeblest
he
was
a
coward
running
away
at
the
first
threat
of
danger
it
was
as
if
he
were
watching
a
tall
stranger
with
a
wand
pointing
to
the
embarrassed
phantom
that
was
himself
and
ruthlessly
exposing
its
frailties
and
yet
the
pitiless
showman
was
himself
too
himself
as
he
wanted
to
be
cheerful
brave
resourceful
indomitable
dickson
suffered
a
spasm
of
mortal
agony
oh
i
surely
not
so
bad
as
all
that
he
groaned
but
the
hurt
was
not
only
in
his
pride
he
saw
himself
being
forced
to
new
decisions
and
each
alternative
was
of
the
blackest
he
fairly
shivered
with
the
horror
of
it
the
car
slipped
past
a
suburban
station
from
which
passengers
were
emerging
comfortable
men
such
as
he
had
once
been
he
was
bitterly
angry
with
providence
for
picking
him
out
of
the
great
crowd
of
sedentary
folk
for
this
sore
ordeal
why
was
i
tethered
to
sich
a
conscience
was
his
moan
but
there
was
that
stern
inquisitor
with
his
pointer
exploring
his
soul
you
flatter
yourself
you
have
done
your
share
he
was
saying
you
will
make
pretty
stories
about
it
to
yourself
and
some
day
you
may
tell
your
friends
modestly
disclaiming
any
special
credit
but
you
will
be
a
liar
for
you
know
you
are
afraid
you
are
running
away
when
the
work
is
scarcely
begun
and
leaving
it
to
a
few
boys
and
a
poet
whom
you
had
the
impudence
the
other
day
to
despise
i
think
you
are
worse
than
a
coward
i
think
you
are
a
cad
his
on
the
top
of
the
car
saw
an
absorbed
gentleman
who
seemed
to
have
something
the
matter
with
his
bronchial
tubes
they
could
not
guess
at
the
tortured
soul
the
decision
was
coming
nearer
the
alternatives
loomed
up
dark
and
inevitable
on
one
side
was
submission
to
ignominy
on
the
other
a
return
to
that
place
which
he
detested
and
yet
loathed
himself
for
detesting
it
seems
not
likely
to
have
much
peace
either
way
he
reflected
dismally
how
the
conflict
would
have
ended
had
it
continued
on
these
lines
i
can
not
say
the
soul
of
mccunn
was
being
assailed
by
moral
and
metaphysical
adversaries
with
which
he
had
not
been
trained
to
deal
but
suddenly
it
leapt
from
negatives
to
positives
he
saw
the
face
of
the
girl
in
the
shuttered
house
so
fair
and
young
and
yet
so
haggard
it
seemed
to
be
appealing
to
him
to
rescue
it
from
a
great
loneliness
and
fear
yes
he
had
been
right
it
had
a
strange
look
of
his
janet
the
eyes
the
solemn
mouth
what
was
to
become
of
that
child
if
he
failed
her
in
her
great
need
now
dickson
was
a
practical
man
and
this
view
of
the
case
brought
him
into
a
world
which
he
understood
it
fair
ridiculous
he
reflected
nobody
there
to
take
a
grip
of
things
just
a
wheen
gorbals
keelies
and
the
lad
heritage
not
a
business
man
among
the
lot
the
alternatives
which
hove
before
him
like
two
great
banks
of
cloud
were
altering
their
appearance
one
was
becoming
faint
and
tenuous
the
other
solid
as
ever
was
just
a
shade
less
black
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
in
the
near
distance
the
corner
of
the
road
which
led
to
his
home
i
must
decide
before
i
reach
that
corner
he
told
himself
then
his
mind
became
apathetic
he
began
to
whistle
dismally
through
his
teeth
watching
the
corner
as
it
came
nearer
the
car
stopped
with
a
jerk
i
go
back
he
said
aloud
clambering
down
the
steps
the
truth
was
he
had
decided
five
minutes
before
when
he
first
saw
face
he
walked
briskly
to
his
house
entirely
refusing
to
waste
any
more
energy
on
reflection
this
is
a
business
proposition
he
told
himself
and
i
going
to
handle
it
as
sich
tibby
was
surprised
to
see
him
and
offered
him
tea
in
vain
i
just
back
for
a
few
minutes
let
see
the
letters
there
was
one
from
his
wife
she
proposed
to
stay
another
week
at
the
neuk
hydropathic
and
suggested
that
he
might
join
her
and
bring
her
home
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
affectionate
reply
declining
but
expressing
his
delight
that
she
was
soon
returning
that
very
likely
the
last
time
mamma
will
hear
from
me
he
reflected
but
oddly
enough
without
any
great
fluttering
of
the
heart
then
he
proceeded
to
be
furiously
busy
he
sent
out
tibby
to
buy
another
knapsack
and
to
order
a
cab
and
to
cash
a
considerable
cheque
in
the
knapsack
he
packed
a
fresh
change
of
clothing
and
the
new
safety
razor
but
no
books
for
he
was
past
the
need
of
them
that
done
he
drove
to
his
solicitors
what
like
a
firm
are
glendonan
and
speirs
in
edinburgh
he
asked
the
senior
partner
oh

respectable

lot

factoring

want

near
the
village
of
dalquharter
i
understand
it
to
let
and
i
thinking
of
taking
a
lease
of
it
the
senior
partner
after
some
delay
got
through
to
edinburgh
and
was
presently
engaged
in
the
feverish
dialectic
which
the
telephone
involves
i
want
to
speak
to
glendonan
himself
yes
yes
caw
of

but
my
client
is
positive
that

made

morning

inquire
oh

actual
factoring

by
your
local
agent
james
loudon
in
auchenlochan
you
think
my
client
had
better
get
into
touch
with
him
at
once
just
wait
a
minute
please
he
put
his
hand
over
the
receiver
usual
edinburgh
way
of
doing
business
he
observed
caustically
what
do
you
want
done
i
run
down
and
see
this
loudon
tell
glendonan
and
speirs
to
advise
him
to
expect
me
for
i
go
this
very
day
caw
resumed
his
conversation
my
client
would
like
a
telegram
sent
at
once
to
loudon
introducing
him
he
dickson
mccunn
of
mearns
street
the
great
provision
merchant
you
know
oh
yes
good

any
rent
refer
if
you
like
to
the
strathclyde
bank
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
thank
you
then
that
settled
dickson
next
visit
was
to
a
gunmaker
who
was
a
with
him
in
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
i
want
a
pistol
and
a
lot
of
cartridges
he
announced
i
not
caring
what
kind
it
is
so
long
as
it
is
a
good
one
and
not
too
big
for
yourself
the
gunmaker
asked
you
must
have
a
licence
i
doubt
and
there
a
lot
of
new
regulations
i
ca
wait
on
a
licence
it
for
a
cousin
of
mine
who
off
to
mexico
at
once
you
got
to
find
some
way
of
obliging
an
old
friend
mr
mcnair
mcnair
scratched
his
head
i
do
see
how
i
can
sell
you
one
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
lend
you
one
it
belongs
to
my
nephew
peter
tait
and
has
been
lying
in
a
drawer
ever
since
he
came
back
from
the
front
he
has
no
use
for
it
now
that
he
a
placed
minister
so
dickson
bestowed
in
the
pockets
of
his
waterproof
a
service
revolver
and
fifty
cartridges
and
bade
his
cab
take
him
to
the
shop
in
mearns
street
for
a
moment
the
sight
of
the
familiar
place
struck
a
pang
to
his
breast
but
he
choked
down
unavailing
regrets
he
ordered
a
great
hamper
of
foodstuffs
the
most
delicate
kind
of
tinned
goods
two
perfect
hams
tongues
strassburg
pies
chocolate
cakes
biscuits
and
as
a
last
thought
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
old
liqueur
brandy
it
was
to
be
carefully
packed
addressed
to
morran
dalquharter
station
and
delivered
in
time
for
him
to
take
down
by
the
train
then
he
drove
to
the
terminus
and
dined
with
something
like
a
desperate
peace
in
his
heart
on
this
occasion
he
took
a
ticket
for
he
wanted
to
be
alone
as
the
lights
began
to
be
lit
in
the
wayside
stations
and
the
clear
april
dusk
darkened
into
night
his
thoughts
were
sombre
yet
resigned
he
opened
the
window
and
let
the
sharp
air
of
the
renfrewshire
uplands
fill
the
carriage
it
was
fine
weather
again
after
the
rain
and
a
bright
constellation
perhaps
dougal
friend
hung
in
the
western
sky
how
happy
he
would
have
been
a
week
ago
had
he
been
starting
thus
for
a
country
holiday
he
could
sniff
the
faint
scent
of
and
ploughed
earth
which
had
always
been
his
first
reminder
of
spring
but
he
had
been
pitchforked
out
of
that
old
happy
world
and
could
never
enter
it
again
alas
for
the
roadside
fire
the
cosy
inn
the
the
chavender
or
chub
and
yet
and
yet
he
had
done
the
right
thing
though
the
lord
alone
knew
how
it
would
end
he
began
to
pluck
courage
from
his
very
melancholy
and
hope
from
his
reflections
upon
the
transitoriness
of
life
he
was
austerely
following
romance
as
he
conceived
it
and
if
that
capricious
lady
had
taken
one
dream
from
him
she
might
yet
reward
him
with
a
better
tags
of
poetry
came
into
his
head
which
seemed
to
favour
this
philosophy
particularly
some
lines
of
browning
on
which
he
used
to
discourse
to
his
kirk
literary
society
uncommon
silly
he
considered
these
homilies
of
his
must
have
been
mere
twitterings
of
the
unfledged
but
now
he
saw
more
in
the
lines
a
deeper
interpretation
which
he
had
earned
the
right
to
make
oh
world
where
all
things
change
and
nought
abides
oh
life
the
long
mutation
is
it
so
is
it
with
life
as
with
the
body
change
where
tho
better
follow
good
must
pass
that
was
as
far
as
he
could
get
though
he
cudgelled
his
memory
to
continue
moralising
thus
he
became
drowsy
and
was
almost
asleep
when
the
train
drew
up
at
the
station
of
kirkmichael
chapter
vii
sundry
doings
in
the
mirk
from
kirkmichael
on
the
train
stopped
at
every
station
but
no
passenger
seemed
to
leave
or
arrive
at
the
little
platforms
white
in
the
moon
at
dalquharter
the
case
of
provisions
was
safely
transferred
to
the
porter
with
instructions
to
take
charge
of
it
till
it
was
sent
for
during
the
next
ten
minutes
dickson
mind
began
to
work
upon
his
problem
with
a
certain
briskness
it
was
all
nonsense
that
the
law
of
scotland
could
not
be
summoned
to
the
defence
the
jewels
had
been
safely
got
rid
of
and
who
was
to
dispute
their
possession
not
dobson
and
his
crew
who
had
no
sort
of
title
and
were
out
for
naked
robbery
the
girl
had
spoken
of
greater
dangers
from
new
enemies
kidnapping
perhaps
well
that
was
felony
and
the
police
must
be
brought
in
probably
if
all
were
known
the
three
watchers
had
criminal
records
pages
long
filed
at
scotland
yard
the
man
to
deal
with
that
side
of
the
business
was
loudon
the
factor
and
to
him
he
was
bound
in
the
first
place
he
had
made
a
clear
picture
in
his
head
of
this
loudon
a
derelict
old
country
writer
formal
pedantic
lazy
anxious
only
to
get
an
unprofitable
business
off
his
hands
with
the
least
possible
trouble
never
going
near
the
place
himself
and
ably
supported
in
his
lethargy
by
conceited
edinburgh
writers
to
the
signet
sich
notions
of
business
he
murmured
i
wonder
that
there
a
single
county
family
in
scotland
no
in
the
bankruptcy
court
it
was
his
mission
to
wake
up
james
loudon
arrived
at
auchenlochan
he
went
first
to
the
salutation
hotel
a
pretentious
place
sacred
to
golfers
there
he
engaged
a
bedroom
for
the
night
and
having
certain
scruples
paid
for
it
in
advance
he
also
had
some
sandwiches
prepared
which
he
stowed
in
his
pack
and
filled
his
flask
with
whisky
i
going
home
to
glasgow
by
the
first
train
he
told
the
landlady
and
now
i
got
to
see
a
friend
i
not
be
back
till
late
he
was
assured
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
his
admittance
at
any
hour
and
directed
how
to
find
loudon
dwelling
it
was
an
old
house
fronting
direct
on
the
street
with
a
fanlight
above
the
door
and
a
neat
brass
plate
bearing
the
legend
james
loudon
writer
a
lane
ran
up
one
side
leading
apparently
to
a
garden
for
the
moonlight
showed
the
dusk
of
trees
in
front
was
the
main
street
of
auchenlochan
now
deserted
save
for
a
single
roysterer
and
opposite
stood
the
ancient
town
house
with
arches
where
the
country
folk
came
at
the
spring
and
autumn
hiring
fairs
dickson
rang
the
antiquated
bell
and
was
presently
admitted
to
a
dark
hall
floored
with
where
a
single
showed
that
on
one
side
was
the
business
office
and
on
the
other
the
loudon
was
at
supper
he
was
told
and
he
sent
in
his
card
almost
at
once
the
door
at
the
end
on
the
left
side
was
flung
open
and
a
large
figure
appeared
flourishing
a
napkin
come
in
sir
come
in
it
cried
i
just
finished
a
bite
of
meat
very
glad
to
see
you
here
maggie
what
mean
by
keeping
the
gentleman
standing
in
that
outer
darkness
the
room
into
which
dickson
was
ushered
was
small
and
bright
with
a
red
paper
on
the
walls
a
fire
burning
and
a
big
oil
lamp
in
the
centre
of
a
table
clearly
loudon
had
no
wife
for
it
was
a
bachelor
den
in
every
line
of
it
a
cloth
was
laid
on
a
corner
of
the
table
on
which
stood
the
remnants
of
a
meal
loudon
seemed
to
have
been
about
to
make
a
brew
of
punch
for
a
kettle
simmered
by
the
fire
and
lemons
and
sugar
flanked
a
whisky
decanter
of
the
type
that
used
to
be
known
as
a
mason
mell
the
sight
of
the
lawyer
was
a
surprise
to
dickson
and
dissipated
his
notions
of
an
aged
and
lethargic
incompetent
loudon
was
a
strongly
built
man
who
could
not
be
a
year
over
fifty
he
had
a
ruddy
face
except
for
a
grizzled
moustache
his
grizzled
hair
was
thinning
round
the
temples
but
his
skin
was
unwrinkled
and
his
eyes
had
all
the
vigour
of
youth
his
tweed
suit
was
well
cut
and
the
buff
waistcoat
with
flaps
and
pockets
and
the
plain
leather
watchguard
hinted
at
the
sportsman
as
did
the
racing
prints
on
the
wall
a
pleasant
figure
he
made
his
voice
had
the
frank
ring
due
to
much
use
out
of
doors
and
his
expression
had
the
singular
candour
which
comes
from
grey
eyes
with
large
pupils
and
a
narrow
iris
sit
down
mccunn
take
the
by
the
fire
i
had
a
wire
from
glendonan
and
speirs
about
you
i
was
just
going
to
have
a
glass
of
toddy
a
grand
thing
for
these
uncertain
april
nights
you
join
me
no
well
you
smoke
anyway
there
cigars
at
your
elbow
certainly
a
pipe
if
you
like
this
is
liberty
hall
dickson
found
some
difficulty
in
the
part
for
which
he
had
cast
himself
he
had
expected
to
condescend
upon
an
elderly
inept
and
give
him
sharp
instructions
instead
he
found
himself
faced
with
a
jovial
virile
figure
which
certainly
did
not
suggest
incompetence
it
has
been
mentioned
already
that
he
had
always
great
difficulty
in
looking
any
one
in
the
face
and
this
difficulty
was
intensified
when
he
found
himself
confronted
with
bold
and
candid
eyes
he
felt
abashed
and
a
little
nervous
i
come
to
see
you
about
huntingtower
house
he
began
i
know
so
glendonan
informed
me
well
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
the
place
has
been
standing
empty
far
too
long
and
that
is
worse
for
a
new
house
than
an
old
house
there
not
much
money
to
spend
on
it
either
unless
we
can
make
sure
of
a
good
tenant
how
did
you
hear
about
it
i
was
taking
a
bit
holiday
and
i
spent
a
night
at
dalquharter
with
an
old
auntie
of
mine
you
must
understand
i
just
retired
from
business
and
i
thinking
of
finding
a
country
place
i
used
to
have
the
big
provision
shop
in
mearns
street
now
the
united
supply
stores
limited
you
maybe
heard
of
it
the
other
bowed
and
smiled
who
has
the
name
of
dickson
mccunn
is
known
far
beyond
the
city
of
glasgow
dickson
was
not
insensible
of
the
flattery
and
he
continued
with
more
freedom
i
took
a
walk
and
got
a
glisk
of
the
house
and
i
liked
the
look
of
it
you
see
i
want
a
quiet
bit
a
good
long
way
from
a
town
and
at
the
same
time
a
house
with
all
modern
conveniences
i
suppose
huntingtower
has
that
when
it
was
built
fifteen
years
ago
it
was
considered
a
model
six
bathrooms
its
own
electric
light
plant
steam
heating
an
independent
boiler
for
hot
water
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
i
wo
say
but
what
some
of
these
contrivances
will
want
looking
to
for
the
place
has
been
some
time
empty
but
there
can
be
nothing
very
far
wrong
and
i
can
guarantee
that
the
bones
of
the
house
are
good
well
that
all
right
said
dickson
i
do
mind
spending
a
little
money
myself
if
the
place
suits
me
but
of
that
of
course
i
not
yet
certain
for
i
only
had
a
glimpse
of
the
outside
i
wanted
to
get
into
the
policies
but
a
man
at
the
lodge
would
let
me
they
a
mighty
uncivil
lot
down
there
i
very
sorry
to
hear
that
said
loudon
in
a
tone
of
concern
ay
and
if
i
take
the
place
i
stipulate
that
you
get
rid
of
the
lodgekeepers
there
wo
be
the
slightest
difficulty
about
that
for
they
are
only
weekly
tenants
but
i
vexed
to
hear
they
were
uncivil
i
was
glad
to
get
any
tenant
that
offered
and
they
were
well
recommended
to
me
they
foreigners
one
of
them
is
a
belgian
refugee
that
lady
morewood
took
an
interest
in
but
the
other
spittal
they
call
him
i
thought
he
was
scotch
he
not
that
and
i
do
like
the
innkeeper
either
i
would
want
him
shifted
loudon
laughed
i
dare
say
dobson
is
a
rough
diamond
there
worse
folk
in
the
world
all
the
same
but
i
do
think
he
will
want
to
stay
he
only
went
there
to
pass
the
time
till
he
heard
from
his
brother
in
vancouver
he
a
roving
spirit
and
will
be
off
overseas
again
that
all
right
said
dickson
who
was
beginning
to
have
horrid
suspicions
that
he
might
be
on
a
chase
after
all
well
the
next
thing
is
for
me
to
see
over
the
house
certainly
i
like
to
go
with
you
myself
what
day
would
suit
you
let
me
see
this
is
friday
what
about
this
day
week
i
was
thinking
of
since
i
down
in
these
parts
i
may
as
well
get
the
job
done
loudon
looked
puzzled
i
quite
see
that
but
i
do
think
possible
you
see
i
have
to
consult
the
owners
and
get
their
consent
to
a
lease
of
course
they
have
the
general
purpose
of
letting
but
well
they
queer
folk
the
kennedys
and
his
face
wore
the
smile
of
an
honest
man
preparing
to
make
confidences
when
poor
quentin
died
the
place
went
to
his
two
sisters
in
joint
ownership
a
very
bad
arrangement
as
you
can
imagine
it
is
entailed
and
always
been
pressing
them
to
sell
but
so
far
they
wo
hear
of
it
they
both
married
englishmen
so
it
will
take
a
day
or
two
to
get
in
touch
with
them
one
stukely
lives
in
devonshire
the
other
miss
katie
that
was
married
sir
francis
morewood
the
general
and
i
hear
that
she
expected
back
in
london
next
monday
from
the
riviera
wire
and
write
first
thing
morning
but
you
must
give
me
a
day
or
two
dickson
felt
himself
waking
up
his
doubts
about
his
own
sanity
were
dissolving
for
as
his
mind
reasoned
the
factor
was
prepared
to
do
anything
he
asked
but
only
after
a
week
had
gone
what
he
was
concerned
with
was
the
next
few
days
all
the
same
i
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
even
if
nothing
comes
of
it
loudon
looked
seriously
perplexed
you
will
think
me
absurdly
fussy
mccunn
but
i
must
really
beg
of
you
to
give
up
the
idea
the
kennedys
as
i
have
said
are
well
not
exactly
like
other
people
and
i
have
the
strictest
orders
not
to
let
any
one
visit
the
house
without
their
express
leave
it
sounds
a
ridiculous
rule
but
i
assure
you
as
much
as
my
job
is
worth
to
disregard
it
mean
to
say
not
a
soul
is
allowed
inside
the
house
not
a
soul
well
loudon
i
going
to
tell
you
a
queer
thing
which
i
think
you
ought
to
know
when
i
was
taking
a
walk
the
other
night
your
belgian
would
let
me
into
the
policies
but
i
went
down
the
glen
what
that
they
call
it
the
garple
dean
i
got
round
the
back
where
the
old
ruin
stands
and
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
house
i
tell
you
there
was
somebody
in
it
it
would
be
spittal
who
acts
as
caretaker
it
was
not
it
was
a
woman
i
saw
her
on
the
verandah
the
candid
grey
eyes
were
looking
straight
at
dickson
who
managed
to
bring
his
own
shy
orbs
to
meet
them
he
thought
that
he
detected
a
shade
of
hesitation
then
loudon
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
looking
down
at
his
visitor
he
laughed
with
some
embarrassment
but
ever
so
pleasantly
i
really
do
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
mccunn
here
are
you
coming
to
do
us
all
a
kindness
and
lease
that
infernal
white
elephant
and
here
have
i
been
steadily
hoaxing
you
for
the
last
five
minutes
i
humbly
ask
your
pardon
set
it
down
to
the
loyalty
of
an
old
family
lawyer
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
and
take
you
into
our
confidence
for
i
know
we
are
safe
with
you
the
kennedys
are
always
have
been
just
a
wee
bit
queer
old
inbred
stock
you
know
they
will
produce
somebody
like
poor
quentin
who
was
as
sane
as
you
or
me
but
as
a
rule
in
every
generation
there
is
one
member
of
the
family
or
more
who
is
just
a
little
bit
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
nothing
violent
you
understand
but
just
not
quite
and
as
the
old
folk
say
well
there
a
certain
old
lady
an
aunt
of
quentin
and
his
sisters
who
has
always
been
about
tenpence
in
the
shilling
usually
she
lives
at
bournemouth
but
one
of
her
crazes
is
a
passion
for
huntingtower
and
the
kennedys
have
always
humoured
her
and
had
her
to
stay
every
spring
when
the
house
was
shut
up
that
became
impossible
but
this
year
she
took
such
a
craving
to
come
back
that
lady
morewood
asked
me
to
arrange
it
it
had
to
be
kept
very
quiet
but
the
poor
old
thing
is
perfectly
harmless
and
just
sits
and
knits
with
her
maid
and
looks
out
of
the
seaward
windows
now
you
see
why
i
take
you
there
i
have
to
get
rid
of
the
old
lady
who
in
any
case
was
travelling
south
early
next
week
do
you
understand
perfectly
said
dickson
with
some
fervour
he
had
learned
exactly
what
he
wanted
the
factor
was
telling
him
lies
now
he
knew
where
to
place
loudon
he
always
looked
back
upon
what
followed
as
a
very
creditable
piece
of
for
a
man
who
had
small
experience
in
that
line
is
the
old
lady
a
wee
wizened
body
with
a
black
cap
and
something
like
a
white
cashmere
shawl
round
her
shoulders
you
describe
her
exactly
loudon
replied
eagerly
that
would
explain
the
foreigners
of
course
we
could
have
natives
who
would
make
the
thing
the
clash
of
the
countryside
of
course
not
but
it
must
be
a
difficult
job
to
keep
a
business
like
that
quiet
any
wandering
policeman
might
start
inquiries
and
supposing
the
lady
became
violent
oh
there
no
fear
of
that
besides
i
a
position
in
this
county
deputy
fiscal
and
so
forth
and
a
friend
of
the
chief
constable
i
think
i
may
be
trusted
to
do
a
little
private
explaining
if
the
need
arose
i
see
said
dickson
he
saw
indeed
a
great
deal
which
would
give
him
food
for
furious
thought
well
i
must
just
possess
my
soul
in
patience
here
my
glasgow
address
and
i
look
to
you
to
send
me
a
telegram
whenever
you
ready
for
me
i
at
the
salutation
and
go
home
with
the
first
train
wait
a
minute
and
he
pulled
out
his
watch
there
a
train
stops
at
auchenlochan
at
i
think
i
catch
that
well
loudon
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
i
glad
to
think
that
it
no
be
long
till
we
renew
our
acquaintance
the
factor
accompanied
him
to
the
door
diffusing
geniality
very
pleased
indeed
to
have
met
you
a
pleasant
journey
and
a
quick
return
the
street
was
still
empty
into
a
corner
of
the
arches
opposite
the
moon
was
shining
and
dickson
retired
thither
to
consult
his
map
of
the
neighbourhood
he
found
what
he
wanted
and
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
man
coming
down
the
causeway
promptly
he
retired
into
the
shadow
and
watched
the
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
figure
the
bulk
the
walk
the
carriage
of
the
head
marked
it
for
dobson
the
went
slowly
past
the
factor
house
then
halted
and
retraced
his
steps
then
making
sure
that
the
street
was
empty
turned
into
the
side
lane
which
led
to
the
garden
this
was
what
sailors
call
a
and
strengthened
conviction
he
delayed
no
longer
but
hurried
down
the
side
street
by
which
the
north
road
leaves
the
town
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
of
lochan
and
was
climbing
the
steep
ascent
which
led
to
the
heathy
plateau
separating
that
stream
from
the
garple
before
he
had
got
his
mind
quite
clear
on
the
case
loudon
was
in
the
plot
whatever
it
was
responsible
for
the
details
of
the
imprisonment
but
not
the
main
author
that
must
be
the
unknown
who
was
still
to
come
from
whom
spidel
took
his
orders
dobson
was
probably
loudon
special
henchman
working
directly
under
him
the
immediate
object
had
been
the
jewels
and
they
were
happily
safe
in
the
vaults
of
the
incorruptible
mackintosh
but
and
this
only
on
saskia
evidence
the
worst
danger
to
her
began
with
the
arrival
of
the
unknown
what
could
that
be
probably
kidnapping
he
was
prepared
to
believe
anything
of
people
like
bolsheviks
and
this
danger
was
due
within
the
next
day
or
two
loudon
had
been
quite
willing
to
let
him
into
the
house
and
to
sack
all
the
watchers
within
a
week
from
that
date
the
natural
and
right
thing
was
to
summon
the
aid
of
the
law
but
that
would
be
a
slow
business
with
loudon
able
to
put
spokes
in
the
wheels
and
befog
the
authorities
and
the
mischief
would
be
done
before
a
single
policeman
showed
his
face
in
dalquharter
therefore
he
and
heritage
must
hold
the
fort
in
the
meantime
and
he
would
send
a
wire
to
his
lawyer
caw
to
get
to
work
with
the
constabulary
he
himself
was
probably
free
from
suspicion
in
both
loudon
and
dobson
minds
as
a
harmless
fool
but
that
freedom
would
not
survive
his
reappearance
in
dalquharter
he
could
say
to
be
sure
that
he
had
come
back
to
see
his
auntie
but
that
would
not
satisfy
the
watchers
since
so
far
as
they
knew
he
was
the
only
man
outside
the
gang
who
was
aware
that
people
were
dwelling
in
the
house
they
would
not
tolerate
his
presence
in
the
neighbourhood
he
formulated
his
conclusions
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
business
deal
and
rather
to
his
surprise
was
not
conscious
of
any
fear
as
he
pulled
together
the
belt
of
his
waterproof
he
felt
the
reassuring
bulges
in
its
pockets
which
were
his
pistol
and
cartridges
he
reflected
that
it
must
be
very
difficult
to
miss
with
a
pistol
if
you
fired
it
at
say
three
yards
and
if
there
was
to
be
shooting
that
would
be
his
range
mccunn
had
stumbled
on
the
precious
truth
that
the
best
way
to
be
rid
of
quaking
knees
is
to
keep
a
busy
mind
he
crossed
the
ridge
of
the
plateau
and
looked
down
on
the
garple
glen
there
were
the
lights
of
dalquharter
or
rather
a
single
light
for
the
inhabitants
went
early
to
bed
his
intention
was
to
seek
quarters
with
morran
when
his
eye
caught
a
gleam
in
a
hollow
of
the
moor
a
little
to
the
east
he
knew
it
for
the
around
which
warriors
bivouacked
the
notion
came
to
him
to
go
there
instead
and
hear
the
news
of
the
day
before
entering
the
cottage
so
he
crossed
the
bridge
skirted
a
plantation
of
firs
and
scrambled
through
the
broom
and
heather
in
what
he
took
to
be
the
right
direction
the
moon
had
gone
down
and
the
quest
was
not
easy
dickson
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
road
when
he
was
summoned
by
a
voice
which
seemed
to
arise
out
of
the
ground
who
goes
there
what
that
you
say
who
goes
there
the
point
of
a
pole
was
held
firmly
against
his
chest
i
mccunn
a
friend
of
dougal
stand
friend
the
shadow
before
him
whistled
and
another
shadow
appeared
report
to
the
chief
that
there
a
man
here
name
o
mccunn
seekin
for
him
presently
the
messenger
returned
with
dougal
and
a
cheap
lantern
which
he
flashed
in
dickson
face
oh
it
you
said
that
leader
who
had
his
jaw
bound
up
as
if
he
had
the
toothache
what
are
ye
doing
back
here
to
tell
the
truth
dougal
was
the
answer
i
could
stay
away
i
was
fair
miserable
when
i
thought
of
heritage
and
you
laddies
left
to
yourselves
my
conscience
simply
would
let
me
stop
at
home
so
here
i
am
dougal
grunted
but
clearly
he
approved
for
from
that
moment
he
treated
dickson
with
a
new
respect
formerly
when
he
had
referred
to
him
at
all
it
had
been
as
auld
mccunn
now
it
was
mister
mccunn
he
was
given
rank
as
a
worthy
civilian
ally
the
bivouac
was
a
cheerful
place
in
the
wet
night
a
great
fire
of
pine
roots
and
old
paling
posts
hissed
in
the
fine
rain
and
around
it
crouched
several
urchins
busy
making
oatmeal
cakes
in
the
embers
on
one
side
a
respectable
had
been
constructed
by
nailing
a
plank
to
two
running
sloping
poles
thence
to
the
ground
and
thatching
the
whole
with
spruce
branches
and
heather
on
the
other
side
two
small
dilapidated
tents
were
pitched
dougal
motioned
his
companion
into
the
where
they
had
some
privacy
from
the
rest
of
the
band
well
what
your
news
dickson
asked
he
noticed
that
the
chieftain
seemed
to
have
been
comprehensively
in
the
wars
for
apart
from
the
bandage
on
his
jaw
he
had
numerous
small
cuts
on
his
brow
and
a
great
rent
in
one
of
his
shirt
sleeves
also
he
appeared
to
be
going
lame
and
when
he
spoke
a
new
gap
was
revealed
in
his
large
teeth
things
said
dougal
solemnly
has
come
to
a
bonny
cripus
this
very
night
we
been
in
a
battle
he
spat
fiercely
and
the
light
of
war
burned
in
his
eyes
it
was
the
tinklers
from
the
garple
dean
they
yokit
on
us
about
seven
just
at
the
darkenin
first
they
tried
to
bounce
us
we
were
wanted
here
they
said
so
we
better
clear
i
telled
them
that
it
was
them
that
was
wanted
to
finnick
says
i
d
think
we
take
our
orders
from
dirty
like
you
god
says
they
cut
your
lights
out
and
then
the
battle
started
what
happened
dickson
asked
excitedly
they
were
four
muckle
men
against
six
laddies
and
they
thought
they
had
an
easy
job
little
they
kenned
the
gorbals
i
had
been
expectin
something
of
the
kind
and
had
made
my
plans
they
first
tried
to
pu
down
our
tents
and
burn
them
i
let
them
get
within
five
yards
reservin
my
fire
the
first
volley
stones
from
our
hands
and
our
catties
halted
them
and
before
they
could
recover
three
of
us
had
got
hold
o
burnin
sticks
frae
the
fire
and
were
lammin
into
them
we
kinnled
their
claes
and
they
fell
back
swearin
and
stampin
to
get
the
fire
out
then
i
gave
the
word
and
we
were
on
them
wi
our
poles
the
points
accordin
to
instructions
my
orders
was
to
keep
a
good
distance
for
if
they
had
grippit
one
o
us
he
ha
been
done
for
they
were
roarin
mad
by
now
and
twae
had
out
their
knives
but
they
could
do
muckle
for
it
was
gettin
dark
and
they
did
ken
the
ground
like
us
and
were
aye
trippin
and
tumblin
but
they
pressed
us
hard
and
one
o
them
landed
me
an
awful
clype
on
the
jaw
they
were
still
aiming
at
our
tents
and
i
saw
that
if
they
got
near
the
fire
again
it
would
be
the
end
o
us
so
i
blew
my
whistle
for
thomas
yownie
who
was
in
command
o
the
other
half
of
us
with
instructions
to
fall
upon
their
rear
that
brought
thomas
up
and
the
tinklers
had
to
face
round
about
and
fight
a
battle
on
two
fronts
we
charged
them
and
they
broke
and
the
last
seen
o
them
they
were
coolin
their
burns
in
the
garple
well
done
man
had
you
many
casualties
we
a
a
wee
thing
battered
but
nothing
to
hurt
i
the
worst
for
one
o
them
had
a
grip
o
me
for
about
three
seconds
and
gosh
he
was
fierce
they
beaten
off
for
the
night
anyway
ay
for
the
night
but
they
come
back
never
fear
that
why
i
said
that
things
had
come
to
a
cripus
what
the
news
from
the
house
a
quiet
day
and
no
word
o
lean
or
dobson
dickson
nodded
they
were
hunting
me
heritage
has
gone
to
bide
in
the
hoose
they
were
watchin
the
garple
dean
so
i
took
him
round
by
the
laver
foot
and
up
the
rocks
he
a
grand
climber
yon
we
fund
a
road
up
the
rocks
and
got
in
by
the
verandy
did
ye
ken
that
the
lassie
had
a
pistol
well
she
has
and
it
seems
that
heritage
is
a
good
shot
wi
a
pistol
so
there
some
hope
thereaways
are
the
jools
safe
safe
in
the
bank
but
the
jools
were
not
the
main
thing
dougal
nodded
so
i
was
thinkin
the
lassie
was
muckle
the
easier
for
gettin
rid
o
them
i
did
just
quite
understand
what
she
said
to
heritage
for
they
were
aye
wanderin
into
foreign
langwidges
but
it
seems
she
terrible
feared
o
somebody
that
may
turn
up
any
moment
what
the
reason
i
ca
say
she
maybe
got
a
secret
or
maybe
just
that
she
ower
bonny
that
the
trouble
said
dickson
and
proceeded
to
recount
his
interview
with
the
factor
to
which
dougal
gave
close
attention
now
the
way
i
read
the
thing
is
this
there
a
plot
to
kidnap
that
lady
for
some
infernal
purpose
and
it
depends
on
the
arrival
of
some
person
or
persons
and
it
due
to
happen
in
the
next
day
or
two
if
we
try
to
work
it
through
the
police
alone
they
beat
us
for
loudon
will
manage
to
hang
the
business
up
till
it
too
late
so
we
must
take
up
the
job
ourselves
we
must
stand
a
siege
heritage
and
me
and
you
laddies
and
for
that
purpose
we
better
all
keep
together
it
wo
be
extra
easy
to
carry
her
off
from
all
of
us
and
if
they
do
manage
it
we
stick
to
their
heels
man
dougal
is
it
a
queer
thing
that
whiles
folk
have
to
make
their
own
laws
so
my
plan
is
that
the
lot
of
us
get
into
the
house
and
form
a
garrison
if
you
do
the
tinklers
will
come
back
and
you
no
beat
them
in
the
daylight
i
doubt
no
said
dougal
but
what
about
our
meat
we
must
lay
in
provisions
we
get
what
we
can
from
morran
and
i
left
a
big
box
of
fancy
things
at
dalquharter
station
can
you
laddies
manage
to
get
it
down
here
dougal
reflected
ay
we
can
hire
sempill
powny
the
same
that
fetched
our
kit
well
that
your
job
see
i
write
you
a
line
to
the
and
will
you
undertake
to
get
it
some
way
into
the
house
there
just
the
one
road
open
by
the
rocks
it
have
to
be
done
it
be
done
and
i
another
job
i
writing
this
telegram
to
a
friend
in
glasgow
who
will
put
a
spoke
in
loudon
wheel
i
want
one
of
you
to
go
to
kirkmichael
to
send
it
from
the
telegraph
office
there
dougal
placed
the
wire
to
caw
in
his
bosom
what
about
yourself
we
want
somebody
outside
to
keep
his
eyes
open
it
bad
strawtegy
to
cut
off
your
communications
dickson
thought
for
a
moment
i
believe
you
right
i
believe
the
best
plan
for
me
is
to
go
back
to
morran
as
soon
as
the
old
body
like
to
be
awake
you
can
always
get
at
me
there
for
it
easy
to
slip
into
her
back
kitchen
without
anybody
in
the
village
seeing
you
yes
i
do
that
and
you
come
and
report
developments
to
me
and
now
i
for
a
bite
and
a
pipe
it
hungry
work
travelling
the
country
in
the
small
hours
i
going
to
introjuice
ye
to
the
rest
o
us
said
dougal
here
men
he
called
and
four
figures
rose
from
the
side
of
the
fire
as
dickson
munched
a
sandwich
he
passed
in
review
the
whole
company
of
the
gorbals
for
the
pickets
were
also
brought
in
two
others
taking
their
places
there
was
thomas
yownie
the
chief
of
staff
with
a
wrist
wound
up
in
the
handkerchief
which
he
had
borrowed
from
his
neck
there
was
a
burly
lad
who
wore
trousers
much
too
large
for
him
and
who
was
known
as
peer
pairson
a
contraction
presumably
for
peter
paterson
after
him
came
a
lean
tall
boy
who
answered
to
the
name
of
napoleon
there
was
a
midget
of
a
child
desperately
sooty
in
the
face
either
from
battle
or
from
who
was
presented
as
wee
jaikie
last
came
the
picket
who
had
held
his
pole
at
dickson
chest
a
warrior
with
a
snub
nose
and
the
mouth
and
jaw
of
a
he
was
old
bill
or
in
dougal
parlance
auld
bull
the
chieftain
viewed
his
scarred
following
with
a
grim
content
a
tough
lot
for
ye
mccunn
used
a
their
days
wi
sleepin
in
coalrees
and
dunnies
and
dodgin
the
polis
ye
no
beat
the
gorbals
you
right
dougal
said
dickson
there
just
the
six
of
you
if
there
were
a
dozen
i
think
this
country
would
be
needing
some
new
kind
of
a
government
chapter
viii
how
a
crusader
accepted
a
challenge
the
first
cocks
had
just
begun
to
crow
and
the
clocks
had
not
yet
struck
five
when
dickson
presented
himself
at
morran
back
door
that
active
woman
had
already
been
half
an
hour
out
of
bed
and
was
drinking
her
morning
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
she
received
him
with
cordiality
nay
with
relief
eh
sirs
but
i
glad
to
see
ye
back
guid
kens
what
gaun
on
at
the
hoose
thae
days
heritage
left
here
yestreen
creepin
round
by
and
like
a
wheasel
it
a
mercy
to
get
a
responsible
man
in
the
place
i
aye
had
a
notion
ye
wad
come
back
for
thinks
i
nevoy
dickson
is
no
the
yin
to
desert
folk
in
trouble
whaur
my
wee
kist
lost
ye
say
that
a
peety
for
it
been
my
thae
thirty
year
dickson
ascended
to
the
loft
having
announced
his
need
of
at
least
three
hours
sleep
as
he
rolled
into
bed
his
mind
was
curiously
at
ease
he
felt
equipped
for
any
call
that
might
be
made
on
him
that
morran
should
welcome
him
back
as
a
resource
in
need
gave
him
a
new
assurance
of
manhood
he
woke
between
nine
and
ten
to
the
sound
of
rain
lashing
against
the
garret
window
as
he
picked
his
way
out
of
the
mazes
of
sleep
and
recovered
the
skein
of
his
immediate
past
he
found
to
his
disgust
that
he
had
lost
his
composure
all
the
flock
of
fears
that
had
left
him
when
on
the
top
of
the
glasgow
he
had
made
the
great
decision
had
flown
back
again
and
settled
like
black
crows
on
his
spirit
he
was
running
a
horrible
risk
and
all
for
a
whim
what
business
had
he
to
be
mixing
himself
up
in
things
he
did
not
understand
it
might
be
a
huge
mistake
and
then
he
would
be
a
laughing
stock
for
a
moment
he
repented
his
telegram
to
caw
then
he
recanted
that
suspicion
there
could
be
no
mistake
except
the
fatal
one
that
he
had
taken
on
a
job
too
big
for
him
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
shivered
with
his
eyes
on
the
grey
drift
of
rain
he
would
have
felt
more
had
the
sun
been
shining
he
shuffled
to
the
window
and
looked
out
there
in
the
village
street
was
dobson
and
dobson
saw
him
that
was
a
bad
blunder
for
his
reason
told
him
that
he
should
have
kept
his
presence
in
dalquharter
hid
as
long
as
possible
there
was
a
knock
at
the
cottage
door
and
presently
morran
appeared
it
the
man
frae
the
inn
she
announced
he
wantin
a
word
wi
ye
speakin
verra
ceevil
too
tell
him
to
come
up
said
dickson
he
might
as
well
get
the
interview
over
dobson
had
seen
loudon
and
must
know
of
their
conversation
the
sight
of
himself
back
again
when
he
had
pretended
to
be
off
to
glasgow
would
remove
him
effectually
from
the
class
of
the
unsuspected
he
wondered
just
what
line
dobson
would
take
the
innkeeper
obtruded
his
bulk
through
the
low
door
his
face
was
wrinkled
into
a
smile
which
nevertheless
left
the
small
eyes
ungenial
his
voice
had
a
loud
vulgar
cordiality
suddenly
dickson
was
conscious
of
a
resemblance
a
resemblance
to
somebody
whom
he
had
recently
seen
it
was
loudon
there
was
the
same
thrusting
of
the
chin
forward
the
same
odd
the
same
unctuous
heartiness
of
speech
the
innkeeper
well
washed
and
polished
and
dressed
would
be
no
bad
copy
of
the
factor
they
must
be
near
kin
perhaps
brothers
good
morning
to
you
mccunn
man
it
pitifu
weather
and
just
when
the
farmers
are
wanting
a
dry
what
brings
ye
back
here
ye
travel
the
country
like
a
drover
oh
i
a
free
man
now
and
i
took
a
fancy
to
this
place
an
idle
body
has
nothing
to
do
but
please
himself
i
hear
ye
taking
a
lease
of
huntingtower
now
who
told
you
that
just
the
clash
of
the
place
is
it
true
dickson
looked
sly
and
a
little
annoyed
i
maybe
had
half
a
thought
of
it
but
i
thank
you
not
to
repeat
the
story
it
a
big
house
for
a
plain
man
like
me
and
i
have
properly
inspected
it
oh
i
keep
mum
never
fear
but
if
ye
that
sort
of
notion
i
can
understand
you
not
being
able
to
keep
away
from
the
place
that
maybe
the
fact
dickson
admitted
well
it
just
on
that
point
i
want
a
word
with
you
the
innkeeper
seated
himself
unbidden
on
the
chair
which
held
dickson
modest
raiment
he
leaned
forward
and
with
a
coarse
forefinger
tapped
knees
i
ca
have
ye
wandering
about
the
place
i
very
sorry
but
i
got
my
orders
from
loudon
so
if
you
think
that
by
bidin
here
ye
can
see
more
of
the
house
and
the
policies
ye
wrong
mccunn
it
ca
be
allowed
for
we
no
ready
for
ye
yet
d
understand
that
loudon
orders
now
would
it
not
be
a
far
better
plan
if
ye
went
back
to
glasgow
and
came
back
in
a
week
time
i
thinking
of
your
own
comfort
mr
mccunn
dickson
was
cogitating
hard
this
man
was
clearly
instructed
to
get
rid
of
him
at
all
costs
for
the
next
few
days
the
neighbourhood
had
to
be
cleared
for
some
black
business
the
tinklers
had
been
deputed
to
drive
out
the
gorbals
and
as
for
heritage
they
seemed
to
have
lost
track
of
him
he
dickson
was
now
the
chief
object
of
their
care
but
what
could
dobson
do
if
he
refused
he
dared
not
show
his
true
hand
yet
he
might
if
sufficiently
irritated
it
became
dickson
immediate
object
to
get
the
innkeeper
to
reveal
himself
by
rousing
his
temper
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
the
policy
of
this
course
he
imperatively
wanted
things
cleared
up
and
the
issue
made
plain
i
sure
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
thinking
so
much
about
my
comfort
he
said
in
a
voice
into
which
he
hoped
he
had
insinuated
a
sneer
but
i
bound
to
say
you
awful
suspicious
folk
about
here
you
need
be
feared
for
your
old
policies
there
plenty
of
nice
walks
about
the
roads
and
i
want
to
explore
the
the
last
words
seemed
to
annoy
the
innkeeper
that
no
allowed
either
he
said
the
shore
as
private
as
the
policies
well
i
wish
ye
joy
tramping
the
roads
in
the
glaur
it
a
queer
thing
said
dickson
meditatively
that
you
should
keep
an
hotel
and
yet
be
set
on
discouraging
people
from
visiting
this
neighbourhood
i
tell
you
what
i
believe
that
hotel
of
yours
is
all
sham
you
some
other
business
you
and
these
lodgekeepers
and
in
my
opinion
it
not
a
very
creditable
one
what
d
mean
asked
dobson
sharply
just
what
i
say
you
must
expect
a
body
to
be
suspicious
if
you
treat
him
as
you
treating
me
loudon
must
have
told
this
man
the
story
with
which
he
had
been
fobbed
off
about
the
kennedy
relative
would
dobson
refer
to
that
the
innkeeper
had
an
ugly
look
on
his
face
but
he
controlled
his
temper
with
an
effort
there
no
cause
for
suspicion
he
said
as
far
as
i
concerned
it
all
honest
and
aboveboard
it
does
look
like
it
it
looks
as
if
you
were
hiding
something
up
in
the
house
which
you
do
want
me
to
see
dobson
jumped
from
his
chair
his
face
pale
with
anger
a
man
in
pyjamas
on
a
raw
morning
does
not
feel
at
his
bravest
and
dickson
quailed
under
the
expectation
of
assault
but
even
in
his
fright
he
realised
that
loudon
could
not
have
told
dobson
the
tale
of
the
lady
the
last
remark
had
cut
clean
through
all
camouflage
and
reached
the
quick
what
the
hell
d
ye
mean
he
cried
ye
a
spy
are
ye
ye
fat
little
fool
for
two
cents
i
wring
your
neck
now
it
is
an
odd
trait
of
certain
mild
people
that
a
suspicion
of
threat
a
hint
of
bullying
will
rouse
some
unsuspected
obstinacy
deep
down
in
their
souls
the
insolence
of
the
man
speech
woke
a
quiet
but
efficient
little
devil
in
dickson
that
a
bonny
tone
to
adopt
in
addressing
a
gentleman
if
nothing
to
hide
what
way
are
you
so
touchy
i
ca
be
a
spy
unless
there
something
to
spy
on
the
innkeeper
pulled
himself
together
he
was
apparently
acting
on
instructions
and
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
them
he
made
an
attempt
at
a
smile
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
spoke
too
hot
but
it
nettled
me
to
hear
ye
say
that
i
be
quite
frank
with
ye
mccunn
and
believe
me
i
speaking
in
your
best
interests
i
give
ye
my
word
there
nothing
wrong
up
at
the
house
i
on
the
side
of
the
law
and
when
i
tell
ye
the
whole
story
ye
admit
it
but
i
ca
tell
it
ye
yet
this
is
a
wild
lonely
bit
and
very
few
folk
bide
in
it
and
these
are
wild
times
when
a
lot
of
queer
things
happen
that
never
get
into
the
papers
i
tell
ye
it
for
your
own
good
to
leave
dalquharter
for
the
present
more
i
ca
say
but
i
ask
ye
to
look
at
it
as
a
sensible
man
ye
one
that
accustomed
to
a
quiet
life
and
no
meant
for
rough
work
ye
do
no
good
if
you
stay
and
maybe
ye
land
yourself
in
bad
trouble
mercy
on
us
dickson
exclaimed
what
is
it
you
expecting
sinn
fein
the
innkeeper
nodded
something
like
that
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
i
never
did
think
much
of
the
irish
then
ye
take
my
advice
and
go
home
tell
ye
what
i
drive
ye
to
the
station
dickson
got
up
from
the
bed
found
his
new
and
began
to
strop
it
no
i
think
i
bide
if
you
right
there
be
more
to
see
than
glaury
roads
i
warning
ye
fair
and
honest
ye
ca
be
allowed
to
stay
here
well
i
never
said
dickson
is
there
any
law
in
scotland
think
you
that
forbids
a
man
to
stop
a
day
or
two
with
his
auntie
ye
stay
ay
i
stay
by
god
we
see
about
that
for
a
moment
dickson
thought
that
he
would
be
attacked
and
he
measured
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
peg
whence
hung
his
waterproof
with
the
pistol
in
its
pocket
but
the
man
restrained
himself
and
moved
to
the
door
there
he
stood
and
cursed
him
with
a
violence
and
a
venom
which
dickson
had
not
believed
possible
the
full
hand
was
on
the
table
now
ye
wee
glasgow
grocer
i
paraphrase
would
set
up
to
defy
me
i
tell
ye
i
make
ye
rue
the
day
ye
were
born
his
parting
words
were
a
brilliant
sketch
of
the
maltreatment
in
store
for
the
body
of
the
defiant
one
impident
dog
said
dickson
without
heat
he
noted
with
pleasure
that
the
innkeeper
hit
his
head
violently
against
the
low
lintel
and
missing
a
step
fell
down
the
loft
stairs
into
the
kitchen
where
morran
tongue
could
be
heard
speeding
him
trenchantly
from
the
premises
left
to
himself
dickson
dressed
leisurely
and
by
and
by
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
watched
his
hostess
making
broth
the
fracas
with
dobson
had
done
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
for
it
had
cleared
the
problem
of
dubieties
and
had
put
an
edge
on
his
temper
but
he
realised
that
it
made
his
continued
stay
in
the
cottage
undesirable
he
was
now
the
focus
of
all
suspicion
and
the
innkeeper
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
and
try
to
drive
him
out
of
the
place
by
force
kidnapping
most
likely
and
that
would
be
highly
unpleasant
besides
putting
an
end
to
his
usefulness
clearly
he
must
join
the
others
the
soul
of
dickson
hungered
at
the
moment
for
human
companionship
he
felt
that
his
courage
would
be
sufficient
for
any
but
might
waver
again
if
he
were
left
to
play
a
lone
hand
he
lunched
nobly
off
three
plates
of
morran
kail
an
early
lunch
for
that
lady
having
breakfasted
at
five
partook
of
the
midday
meal
about
eleven
then
he
explored
her
library
and
settled
himself
by
the
fire
with
a
volume
of
covenanting
tales
entitled
among
the
it
was
a
most
practical
work
for
one
in
his
position
for
it
told
how
various
eminent
saints
of
that
era
escaped
the
attention
of
claverhouse
dragoons
dickson
stored
up
in
his
memory
several
of
the
incidents
in
case
they
should
come
in
handy
he
wondered
if
any
of
his
forbears
had
been
covenanters
it
comforted
him
to
think
that
some
old
progenitor
might
have
hunkered
behind
turf
walls
and
been
chased
for
his
life
in
the
heather
just
like
me
he
reflected
but
the
dragoons
were
foreigners
and
there
was
a
kind
of
decency
about
claverhouse
too
about
four
dougal
presented
himself
in
the
back
kitchen
he
was
an
even
wilder
figure
than
usual
for
his
bare
legs
were
mud
to
the
knees
his
kilt
and
shirt
clung
sopping
to
his
body
and
having
lost
his
hat
his
wet
hair
was
plastered
over
his
eyes
morran
said
not
unkindly
that
he
looked
like
a
glowerin
through
a
whin
buss
how
are
you
dougal
dickson
asked
genially
is
the
peace
of
nature
smoothing
out
the
creases
in
your
poor
little
soul
what
that
ye
say
oh
just
what
i
heard
a
man
say
in
glasgow
how
have
you
got
on
not
so
bad
your
telegram
was
sent
this
mornin
old
bill
took
it
in
to
kirkmichael
that
the
first
thing
second
thomas
yownie
has
took
a
party
to
get
down
the
box
from
the
station
he
got
sempill
powny
and
he
took
the
box
ayont
the
laver
by
the
ford
at
the
herd
hoose
and
got
it
on
to
the
shore
maybe
a
mile
ayont
laverfoot
he
managed
to
get
the
machine
up
as
far
as
the
water
but
he
could
get
no
farther
for
ye
no
get
a
machine
over
the
wee
waterfa
just
before
the
laver
ends
in
the
sea
so
he
sent
one
o
the
men
back
with
it
to
sempill
and
since
the
box
was
ower
heavy
to
carry
he
opened
it
and
took
the
stuff
across
in
bits
it
a
safe
in
the
hole
at
the
foot
o
the
huntingtower
rocks
and
he
reports
that
the
rain
has
done
it
no
harm
thomas
has
made
a
good
job
of
it
ye
no
fickle
thomas
yownie
and
what
about
your
camp
on
the
moor
it
was
broke
up
afore
daylight
some
of
our
things
we
got
with
us
and
most
is
hid
near
at
hand
the
tents
are
in
the
auld
henhoose
and
he
jerked
his
disreputable
head
in
the
direction
of
the
back
door
have
the
tinklers
been
back
ay
they
turned
up
about
ten
no
doubt
intendin
murder
i
left
wee
jaikie
to
watch
developments
they
fund
him
sittin
on
a
stone
greetin
sore
when
he
saw
them
he
up
and
started
to
run
and
they
cried
on
him
to
stop
but
he
would
listen
then
they
cried
out
where
were
the
rest
and
he
telled
them
they
were
feared
for
their
lives
and
had
run
away
after
that
they
offered
to
catch
him
but
ye
no
catch
jaikie
in
a
hurry
when
he
had
run
round
about
them
till
they
were
wappit
he
out
wi
his
catty
and
got
one
o
them
on
the
lug
syne
he
made
for
the
laverfoot
and
reported
man
dougal
you
managed
fine
now
i
something
to
tell
you
and
dickson
recounted
his
interview
with
the
innkeeper
i
do
think
safe
for
me
to
bide
here
and
if
i
did
i
would
be
any
use
hiding
in
cellars
and
such
like
and
not
daring
to
stir
a
foot
i
coming
with
you
to
the
house
now
tell
me
how
to
get
there
dougal
agreed
to
this
view
there
been
nothing
doing
at
the
hoose
the
day
but
they
keepin
a
close
watch
on
the
policies
the
cripus
may
come
any
moment
there
no
doubt
mccunn
that
ye
in
danger
for
they
serve
you
as
the
tinklers
tried
to
serve
us
listen
to
me
walk
up
the
station
road
and
take
the
second
turn
on
your
left
a
wee
grass
road
that
bring
ye
to
the
ford
at
the
herd
hoose
cross
the
laver
there
a
plank
bridge
and
take
straight
across
the
moor
in
the
direction
of
the
peakit
hill
they
call
grey
carrick
ye
come
to
a
big
burn
which
ye
must
follow
till
ye
get
to
the
shore
then
turn
south
keepin
the
water
edge
till
ye
reach
the
laver
where
you
find
one
o
us
to
show
ye
the
rest
of
the
road
i
must
be
off
now
and
i
advise
ye
not
to
be
slow
of
startin
for
wi
this
rain
the
risin
quick
it
a
mercy
it
such
coarse
weather
for
it
spoils
the
veesibility
auntie
phemie
said
dickson
a
few
minutes
later
will
you
oblige
me
by
coming
for
a
short
walk
the
man
daft
was
the
answer
i
not
i
explain
if
you
listen
you
see
he
concluded
the
dangerous
bit
for
me
is
just
the
mile
out
of
the
village
they
no
be
so
likely
to
try
violence
if
there
somebody
with
me
that
could
be
a
witness
besides
they
maybe
suspect
less
if
they
just
see
a
decent
body
out
for
a
breath
of
air
with
his
auntie
morran
said
nothing
but
retired
and
returned
presently
equipped
for
the
road
she
had
indued
her
feet
with
goloshes
and
pinned
up
her
skirts
till
they
looked
like
some
demented
paris
mode
an
ancient
bonnet
was
tied
under
her
chin
with
strings
and
her
equipment
was
completed
by
an
exceedingly
smart
umbrella
which
she
explained
had
been
a
christmas
present
from
her
son
i
convoy
ye
as
far
as
the
laverfoot
herd
she
announced
the
wife
a
freend
o
mine
and
will
set
me
a
bit
on
the
road
back
ye
needna
fash
for
me
i
used
to
a
weathers
the
rain
had
declined
to
a
fine
drizzle
but
a
tearing
wind
from
the
scoured
the
land
beyond
the
shelter
of
the
trees
the
moor
was
a
of
gusts
which
swept
the
puddles
into
spindrift
and
gave
to
the
stagnant
the
appearance
of
running
water
the
wind
was
behind
the
travellers
and
morran
like
a
ship
was
hustled
before
it
so
that
dickson
who
had
linked
arms
with
her
was
sometimes
compelled
to
trot
however
will
you
get
home
mistress
he
murmured
anxiously
fine
the
wind
will
fa
at
the
darkenin
this
be
a
sair
time
for
ships
at
sea
not
a
soul
was
about
as
they
breasted
the
ascent
of
the
station
road
and
turned
down
the
grassy
bypath
to
the
laverfoot
herd
the
wife
saw
them
from
afar
and
was
at
the
door
to
receive
them
megsty
phemie
morran
she
shrilled
wha
wad
ettle
to
see

on
a
day
like
this
john
awa
at
dumfries
buyin
tups
come
in
the
baith
ye
the
kettle
on
the
boil
this
is
my
nevoy
dickson
said
morran
he
gaun
to
stretch
his
legs
ayont
the
burn
and
come
back
by
the
ayr
road
but
i
be
blithe
to
tak
my
tea
wi
ye
elspeth
now
dickson
i
expect
ye
back
on
the
chap
o
seeven
he
crossed
the
rising
stream
on
a
swaying
plank
and
struck
into
the
moorland
as
dougal
had
ordered
keeping
the
bald
top
of
grey
carrick
before
him
in
that
wild
place
with
the
tempest
battling
overhead
he
had
no
fear
of
human
enemies
steadily
he
covered
the
ground
till
he
reached
the
burn
that
was
to
lead
him
to
the
shore
he
found
it
an
entertaining
companion
swirling
into
black
pools
foaming
over
little
falls
and
lying
in
dark
stretches
in
the
flats
presently
it
began
to
descend
steeply
in
a
narrow
green
gully
where
the
going
was
bad
and
dickson
weighted
with
pack
and
waterproof
had
much
ado
to
keep
his
feet
on
the
sodden
slopes
then
as
he
rounded
a
crook
of
hill
the
ground
fell
away
from
his
feet
the
burn
swept
in
a
to
the
boulders
of
the
shore
and
the
sea
lay
before
him
it
was
now
that
he
began
to
feel
nervous
being
on
the
coast
again
seemed
to
bring
him
inside
his
enemies
territory
and
had
not
dobson
specifically
forbidden
the
shore
it
was
here
that
they
might
be
looking
for
him
he
felt
himself
out
of
condition
very
wet
and
very
warm
but
he
attained
a
creditable
pace
for
he
struck
a
road
which
had
been
used
by
collecting
seaweed
there
were
faint
marks
on
it
which
he
took
to
be
the
wheels
of
dougal
machine
carrying
the
yes
on
a
patch
of
gravel
there
was
a
double
set
of
tracks
which
showed
how
it
had
returned
to
sempill
he
was
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
the
wind
and
the
strenuousness
of
his
bodily
exertions
kept
his
fears
quiescent
till
the
cliffs
on
his
left
sunk
suddenly
and
the
valley
of
the
laver
lay
before
him
a
small
figure
rose
from
the
shelter
of
a
boulder
the
warrior
who
bore
the
name
of
old
bill
he
saluted
gravely
ye
just
in
time
the
water
has
rose
three
inches
since
i
been
here
ye
better
strip
dickson
removed
his
boots
and
socks
breeks
too
commanded
the
boy
there
deep
holes
ayont
thae
stanes
dickson
obeyed
feeling
very
chilly
and
rather
improper
now
follow
me
said
the
guide
the
next
moment
he
was
stepping
delicately
on
very
sharp
pebbles
holding
on
to
the
end
of
the
scout
pole
while
an
icy
stream
ran
to
his
knees
the
laver
as
it
reaches
the
sea
broadens
out
to
the
width
of
fifty
or
sixty
yards
and
tumbles
over
little
shelves
of
rock
to
meet
the
waves
usually
it
is
shallow
but
now
it
was
swollen
to
an
average
depth
of
a
foot
or
more
and
there
were
deeper
pockets
dickson
made
the
passage
slowly
and
miserably
sometimes
crying
out
with
pain
as
his
toes
struck
a
sharper
flint
once
or
twice
sitting
down
on
a
boulder
to
blow
like
a
whale
once
slipping
on
his
knees
and
wetting
the
strange
excrescence
about
his
middle
which
was
his
waterproof
but
the
crossing
was
at
length
achieved
and
on
a
patch
of
he
dried
himself
perfunctorily
and
hastily
put
on
his
garments
old
bill
who
seemed
to
be
regardless
of
wind
or
water
squatted
beside
him
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
above
them
hung
the
sheer
cliffs
of
the
huntingtower
cape
so
sheer
that
a
man
below
was
completely
hidden
from
any
watcher
on
the
top
heart
fell
for
he
did
not
profess
to
be
a
cragsman
and
had
indeed
a
horror
of
precipitous
places
but
as
the
two
scrambled
along
the
foot
they
passed
gullies
and
fissures
most
of
them
unclimbable
but
offering
something
more
hopeful
than
the
face
at
one
of
these
old
bill
halted
and
led
the
way
up
and
over
a
chaos
of
fallen
rock
and
loose
sand
the
grey
weather
had
brought
on
the
dark
prematurely
and
in
the
it
seemed
that
this
ravine
was
blocked
by
an
unscalable
mass
of
rock
here
old
bill
whistled
and
there
was
a
reply
from
above
round
the
corner
of
the
mass
came
dougal
up
here
he
commanded
it
was
heritage
that
fund
this
road
dickson
and
his
guide
squeezed
themselves
between
the
mass
and
the
cliff
up
a
spout
of
stones
and
found
themselves
in
an
upper
storey
of
the
gulley
very
steep
but
practicable
even
for
one
who
was
no
cragsman
this
in
turn
ran
out
against
a
wall
up
which
there
led
only
a
narrow
chimney
at
the
foot
of
this
were
two
of
the
and
there
were
others
above
for
a
rope
hung
down
by
the
aid
of
which
a
package
was
even
now
ascending
that
the
top
said
dougal
pointing
to
the
rim
of
sky
and
the
last
o
the
supplies
dickson
noticed
that
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
and
that
all
the
movements
of
the
were
judicious
and
stealthy
now
it
your
turn
take
a
good
grip
o
the
rope
and
ye
find
plenty
holes
for
your
feet
it
no
more
than
ten
yards
and
ye
well
held
above
dickson
made
the
attempt
and
found
it
easier
than
he
expected
the
only
trouble
was
his
pack
and
waterproof
which
had
a
tendency
to
catch
on
jags
of
rock
a
hand
was
reached
out
to
him
he
was
pulled
over
the
edge
and
then
pushed
down
on
his
face
when
he
lifted
his
head
dougal
and
the
others
had
joined
him
and
the
whole
company
of
the
was
assembled
on
a
patch
of
grass
which
was
concealed
from
the
landward
view
by
a
thicket
of
hazels
another
whom
he
recognised
as
heritage
was
coiling
up
the
rope
we
better
get
all
the
stuff
into
the
old
tower
for
the
present
heritage
was
saying
it
too
risky
to
move
it
into
the
house
now
we
need
the
thickest
darkness
for
that
after
the
moon
is
down
quick
for
the
beastly
thing
will
be
rising
soon
and
before
that
we
must
all
be
indoors
then
he
turned
to
dickson
and
gripped
his
hand
you
a
high
class
of
sportsman
dogson
and
i
think
you
just
in
time
are
they
due
dickson
asked
in
an
excited
whisper
faint
against
the
wind
i
do
know
about
they
but
i
got
a
notion
that
some
devilish
queer
things
will
happen
before
morning
chapter
ix
the
first
battle
of
the
cruives
the
old
keep
of
huntingtower
stood
some
three
hundred
yards
from
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
a
gnarled
wood
of
hazels
and
oaks
protecting
it
from
the
it
was
still
in
fair
preservation
having
till
twenty
years
before
been
an
adjunct
of
the
house
of
dalquharter
and
used
as
kitchen
buttery
and
servants
quarters
there
had
been
residential
wings
attached
dating
from
the
century
but
these
had
been
pulled
down
and
used
for
the
foundations
of
the
new
mansion
now
it
stood
a
lonely
shell
its
three
storeys
each
a
single
great
room
connected
by
a
spiral
stone
staircase
being
dedicated
to
lumber
and
the
storage
of
produce
but
it
was
dry
and
intact
its
massive
oak
doors
defied
any
weapon
short
of
artillery
its
narrow
unglazed
windows
would
scarcely
have
admitted
a
cat
a
place
portentously
strong
gloomy
but
yet
habitable
dougal
opened
the
main
door
with
a
massy
key
the
lassie
fund
it
he
whispered
to
dickson
somewhere
about
the
kitchen
and
i
guessed
it
was
the
key
o
this
castle
i
was
thinkin
that
if
things
got
ower
hot
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
flit
here
change
our
base
like
the
chieftain
occasional
studies
in
war
had
trained
his
tongue
to
a
military
jargon
in
the
ground
room
lay
a
fine
assortment
of
oddments
including
old
bedsteads
and
servants
furniture
and
what
looked
like
ancient
discarded
rugs
dust
lay
thick
over
everything
and
they
heard
the
scurry
of
rats
a
dismal
place
indeed
but
dickson
felt
only
its
strangeness
the
comfort
of
being
back
again
among
allies
had
quickened
his
spirit
to
an
adventurous
mood
the
old
lords
of
huntingtower
had
once
quarrelled
and
revelled
and
plotted
here
and
now
here
he
was
at
the
same
game
present
and
past
joined
hands
over
the
gulf
of
years
the
saga
of
huntingtower
was
not
ended
the
had
brought
with
them
their
scanty
bedding
their
lanterns
and
camp
kettles
these
and
the
provisions
from
mearns
street
were
stowed
away
in
a
corner
now
for
the
hoose
men
said
dougal
they
stole
over
the
downs
to
the
shrubbery
and
dickson
found
himself
almost
in
the
same
place
as
he
had
lain
in
three
days
before
watching
a
dusky
lawn
while
the
wet
earth
soaked
through
his
trouser
knees
and
the
drip
from
the
azaleas
trickled
over
his
spine
two
of
the
boys
fetched
the
ladder
and
placed
it
against
the
verandah
wall
heritage
first
then
dickson
darted
across
the
lawn
and
made
the
ascent
the
six
scouts
followed
and
the
ladder
was
pulled
up
and
hidden
among
the
verandah
litter
for
a
second
the
whole
eight
stood
still
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
except
the
murmur
of
the
now
falling
wind
and
the
melancholy
hooting
of
owls
the
garrison
had
entered
the
dark
tower
a
council
in
whispers
was
held
in
the
garden
room
nobody
must
show
a
light
heritage
observed
it
must
be
known
that
we
here
only
the
princess
will
have
a
lamp
yes
this
in
answer
to
dickson
she
knows
that
we
coming
you
too
we
hunt
for
quarters
later
upstairs
you
scouts
you
must
picket
every
possible
entrance
the
windows
are
safe
i
think
for
they
are
locked
from
the
inside
so
is
the
main
door
but
there
the
verandah
door
of
which
they
have
a
key
and
the
back
door
beside
the
kitchen
and
i
not
at
all
sure
that
there
not
a
way
in
by
the
you
understand
we
holding
this
place
against
all
comers
we
must
barricade
the
danger
points
the
headquarters
of
the
garrison
will
be
in
the
hall
where
a
scout
must
be
always
on
duty
you
all
got
whistles
well
if
there
an
attempt
on
the
verandah
door
the
picket
will
whistle
once
if
at
the
back
door
twice
if
anywhere
else
three
times
and
it
everybody
duty
except
the
picket
who
whistles
to
get
back
to
the
hall
for
orders
that
so
assented
dougal
if
the
enemy
forces
an
entrance
we
must
overpower
him
any
means
you
like
sticks
or
fists
and
remember
that
if
it
a
scrap
in
the
dark
make
for
the
man
throat
i
expect
you
little
devils
have
eyes
like
cats
the
scoundrels
must
be
kept
away
from
the
ladies
at
all
costs
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
the
princess
has
a
revolver
so
have
i
said
dickson
i
got
it
in
glasgow
the
deuce
you
have
can
you
use
it
i
do
know
well
you
can
hand
it
over
to
me
if
you
like
but
it
ought
to
come
to
shooting
if
it
only
the
three
of
them
the
eight
of
us
should
be
able
to
manage
three
and
one
of
them
lame
if
the
others
turn
up
well
god
help
us
all
but
we
got
to
make
sure
of
one
thing
that
no
one
lays
hands
on
the
princess
so
long
as
there
one
of
us
left
alive
to
hit
out
ye
need
be
feared
for
that
said
dougal
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
but
dickson
was
certain
that
the
morose
face
of
the
chieftain
was
lit
with
unholy
joy
then
off
with
you
mccunn
and
i
will
explain
matters
to
the
ladies
when
they
were
alone
heritage
voice
took
a
different
key
we
in
for
it
dogson
old
man
there
no
doubt
these
three
scoundrels
expect
reinforcements
at
any
moment
and
with
them
will
be
one
who
is
the
devil
incarnate
he
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
that
brave
girl
fears
it
seems
he
is
in
love
with
her
and
has
pestered
her
for
years
she
hated
the
sight
of
him
but
he
would
take
no
and
being
a
powerful
man
rich
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
had
a
desperate
time
i
gather
he
was
pretty
high
in
favour
with
the
old
court
then
when
the
bolsheviks
started
he
went
over
to
them
like
plenty
of
other
grandees
and
now
he
one
of
their
chief
brains
none
of
your
callow
revolutionaries
but
a
man
of
the
world
a
kind
of
genius
she
says
who
can
hold
his
own
anywhere
she
believes
him
to
be
in
this
country
and
only
waiting
the
right
moment
to
turn
up
oh
it
sounds
ridiculous
i
know
in
britain
in
the
twentieth
century
but
i
learned
in
the
war
that
civilisation
anywhere
is
a
very
thin
crust
there
are
a
hundred
ways
by
which
that
kind
of
fellow
could
bamboozle
all
our
law
and
police
and
spirit
her
away
that
the
kind
of
crowd
we
have
to
face
did
she
say
what
he
was
like
in
appearance
a
face
like
an
angel
a
lost
angel
she
says
dickson
suddenly
had
an
inspiration
mind
the
man
you
said
was
an
australian
at
kirkmichael
i
thought
myself
he
was
a
foreigner
well
he
was
asking
for
a
place
he
called
darkwater
and
there
no
sich
place
in
the
countryside
i
believe
he
meant
dalquharter
i
believe
he
the
man
she
feared
of
a
gasped
by
jove
came
from
the
darkness
dogson
you
hit
it
that
was
five
days
ago
and
he
must
have
got
on
the
right
trail
by
this
time
he
be
here
that
why
the
three
have
been
lying
so
quiet
well
we
go
through
with
it
even
if
we
have
a
chance
only
i
sorry
that
you
should
be
mixed
up
in
such
a
hopeless
business
why
me
more
than
you
because
it
all
pure
pride
and
joy
for
me
to
be
here
good
god
i
would
be
elsewhere
for
worlds
it
the
great
hour
of
my
life
i
would
gladly
die
for
her
tuts
that
no
the
way
to
talk
man
time
enough
to
speak
about
dying
when
there
no
other
way
out
i
looking
at
this
thing
in
a
business
way
we
better
be
seeing
the
ladies
they
groped
into
the
pitchy
hall
somewhere
in
which
a
was
on
picket
and
down
the
passage
to
the
dickson
blinked
in
the
light
of
a
very
feeble
lamp
and
heritage
saw
that
his
hands
were
cumbered
with
packages
he
deposited
them
on
a
sofa
and
made
a
ducking
bow
i
come
back
mem
and
glad
to
be
back
your
jools
are
in
safe
keeping
and
not
all
the
blagyirds
in
creation
could
get
at
them
come
to
tell
you
to
cheer
up
a
stout
heart
to
a
stey
brae
as
the
old
folk
say
i
handling
this
affair
as
a
business
proposition
so
be
feared
mem
if
there
are
enemies
seeking
you
there
friends
on
the
road
too
now
you
have
had
your
dinner
but
you
maybe
like
a
little
dessert
he
spread
before
them
a
huge
box
of
chocolates
the
best
that
mearns
street
could
produce
a
box
of
candied
fruits
and
another
of
salted
almonds
then
from
his
hideously
overcrowded
pockets
he
took
another
box
which
he
offered
rather
shyly
that
some
powder
for
your
complexion
they
tell
me
that
ladies
find
it
useful
whiles
the
girl
strained
face
watched
him
at
first
in
mystification
and
then
broke
slowly
into
a
smile
youth
came
back
to
it
the
smile
changed
to
a
laugh
a
low
rippling
laugh
like
bells
she
took
both
his
hands
you
are
kind
she
said
you
are
kind
and
brave
you
are
a
and
then
she
kissed
him
now
as
far
as
dickson
could
remember
no
one
had
ever
kissed
him
except
his
wife
the
light
touch
of
her
lips
on
his
forehead
was
like
the
pressing
of
an
electric
button
which
explodes
some
powerful
charge
and
alters
the
face
of
a
countryside
he
blushed
scarlet
then
he
wanted
to
cry
then
he
wanted
to
sing
an
immense
exhilaration
seized
him
and
i
am
certain
that
if
at
that
moment
the
serried
ranks
of
bolshevism
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
dickson
would
have
hurled
himself
upon
them
with
a
joyful
shout
cousin
eug√®nie
was
earnestly
eating
chocolates
but
saskia
had
other
business
you
will
hold
the
house
she
asked
please
god
yes
said
heritage
i
look
at
it
this
way
the
time
is
very
near
when
your
three
gaolers
expect
the
others
their
masters
they
have
not
troubled
you
in
the
past
two
days
as
they
threatened
because
it
was
not
worth
while
but
they
wo
want
to
let
you
out
of
their
sight
in
the
final
hours
so
they
will
almost
certainly
come
here
to
be
on
the
spot
our
object
is
to
keep
them
out
and
confuse
their
plans
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
probably
very
near
is
the
man
you
fear
most
if
we
nonplus
the
three
watchers
they
have
to
revise
their
policy
and
that
means
a
delay
and
every
hour
delay
is
a
gain
mccunn
has
found
out
that
the
factor
loudon
is
in
the
plot
and
he
has
purchase
enough
it
seems
to
blanket
for
a
time
any
appeal
to
the
law
but
mccunn
has
taken
steps
to
circumvent
him
and
in
hours
we
should
have
help
here
i
do
not
want
the
help
of
your
law
the
girl
interrupted
it
will
entangle
me
not
a
bit
of
it
said
dickson
cheerfully
you
see
mem
they
clean
lost
track
of
the
jools
and
nobody
knows
where
they
are
but
me
i
a
truthful
man
but
i
lie
like
a
packman
if
i
asked
questions
for
the
rest
it
a
question
of
kidnapping
i
understand
and
that
a
thing
that
not
to
be
allowed
my
advice
is
to
go
to
our
beds
and
get
a
little
sleep
while
there
a
chance
of
it
the
gorbals
are
grand
this
view
sounded
so
reasonable
that
it
was
at
once
acted
upon
the
ladies
chamber
was
next
door
to
the
what
had
been
the
old
schoolroom
heritage
arranged
with
saskia
that
the
lamp
was
to
be
kept
burning
low
and
that
on
no
account
were
they
to
move
unless
summoned
by
him
then
he
and
dickson
made
their
way
to
the
hall
where
there
was
a
faint
glimmer
from
the
moon
in
the
upper
unshuttered
windows
enough
to
reveal
the
figure
of
wee
jaikie
on
duty
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
they
ascended
to
the
second
floor
where
in
a
large
room
above
the
hall
heritage
had
bestowed
his
pack
he
had
managed
to
open
a
fold
of
the
shutters
and
there
was
sufficient
light
to
see
two
big
mahogany
bedsteads
without
mattresses
or
bedclothes
and
wardrobes
and
chests
of
drawers
sheeted
in
holland
outside
the
wind
was
rising
again
but
the
rain
had
stopped
angry
watery
clouds
scurried
across
the
heavens
dickson
made
a
pillow
of
his
waterproof
stretched
himself
on
one
of
the
bedsteads
and
so
quiet
was
his
conscience
and
so
weary
his
body
from
the
buffetings
of
the
past
days
was
almost
instantly
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
when
he
was
awakened
by
dougal
hand
pinching
his
shoulder
he
gathered
that
the
moon
was
setting
for
the
room
was
pitchy
dark
the
three
o
them
is
approachin
the
kitchen
door
whispered
the
chieftain
i
seen
them
from
a
i
made
out
o
a
ventilator
is
it
barricaded
asked
heritage
who
had
apparently
not
been
asleep
ay
but
i
thought
o
a
far
better
plan
why
should
we
keep
them
out
they
be
safer
inside
listen
we
might
manage
to
get
them
in
one
at
a
time
if
they
ca
get
in
at
the
kitchen
door
they
send
one
o
them
round
to
get
in
by
another
door
and
open
to
them
that
gives
us
a
chance
to
get
them
separated
and
lock
them
up
there
walth
o
closets
and
all
over
the
place
each
with
good
doors
and
good
keys
to
them
supposin
we
get
the
three
o
them
shut
up
the
others
when
they
come
will
have
nobody
to
guide
them
of
course
some
time
or
other
the
three
will
break
out
but
it
may
be
ower
late
for
them
at
present
besieged
and
they
roamin
the
country
would
it
no
be
far
better
if
they
were
the
ones
lockit
up
and
we
were
goin
loose
supposing
they
do
come
in
one
at
a
time
dickson
objected
we
make
them
said
dougal
firmly
there
no
time
to
waste
are
ye
for
it
yes
said
heritage
who
at
the
kitchen
door
peter
paterson
i
told
him
no
to
whistle
but
to
wait
on
me
keep
your
boots
off
ye
better
in
your
stockin
feet
wait
you
in
the
hall
and
see
ye
well
hidden
for
likely
whoever
comes
in
will
have
a
lantern
just
you
keep
quiet
unless
i
give
ye
a
cry
i
planned
it
out
and
we
ready
for
them
dougal
disappeared
and
dickson
and
heritage
with
their
boots
tied
round
their
necks
by
their
laces
crept
out
to
the
upper
landing
the
hall
was
impenetrably
dark
but
full
of
voices
for
the
wind
was
talking
in
the
ceiling
beams
and
murmuring
through
the
long
passages
the
walls
creaked
and
muttered
and
little
bits
of
plaster
fluttered
down
the
noise
was
an
advantage
for
the
game
of
they
proposed
to
play
but
it
made
it
hard
to
detect
the
enemy
approach
dickson
in
order
to
get
properly
wakened
adventured
as
far
as
the
it
was
black
with
night
but
below
the
door
of
the
adjacent
room
a
faint
line
of
light
showed
where
the
princess
lamp
was
burning
he
advanced
to
the
window
and
heard
distinctly
a
foot
on
the
gravel
path
that
led
to
the
verandah
this
sent
him
back
to
the
hall
in
search
of
dougal
whom
he
encountered
in
the
passage
that
boy
could
certainly
see
in
the
dark
for
he
caught
dickson
wrist
without
hesitation
we
got
spittal
in
the
he
whispered
triumphantly
the
kitchen
door
was
barricaded
and
when
they
tried
it
it
would
open
here
says
dobson
to
spittal
we
go
round
by
another
door
and
come
back
and
open
to
ye
so
off
they
went
and
by
that
time
peter
paterson
and
me
had
the
barricade
down
as
we
expected
spittal
tried
the
key
again
and
it
opens
quite
easy
he
comes
in
and
locks
it
behind
him
and
dobson
having
took
away
the
lantern
he
gropes
his
way
very
carefu
towards
the
kitchen
there
a
point
where
the
door
and
the
scullery
door
are
aside
each
other
he
should
have
taken
the
second
but
i
had
it
shut
so
he
takes
the
first
peter
paterson
gave
him
a
wee
shove
and
he
fell
down
the
steps
into
the
cellar
and
we
turned
the
key
on
him
yon
cellar
has
a
grand
door
and
no
windies
and
dobson
and
l√©on
are
at
the
verandah
door
with
a
light
thomas
yownie
on
duty
there
ye
can
trust
him
ye
no
fickle
thomas
yownie
the
next
minutes
were
for
dickson
a
delirium
of
excitement
not
unpleasantly
shot
with
flashes
of
doubt
and
fear
as
a
child
he
had
played
and
his
memory
had
always
cherished
the
delights
of
the
game
but
how
marvellous
to
play
it
thus
in
a
great
empty
house
at
dark
of
night
with
the
heaven
filled
with
tempest
and
with
death
or
wounds
as
the
stakes
he
took
refuge
in
a
corner
where
a
tapestry
curtain
and
the
side
of
a
dutch
awmry
gave
him
shelter
and
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
and
the
beginning
of
the
tiled
passage
which
led
to
the
verandah
door
that
is
to
say
he
could
have
seen
these
things
if
there
had
been
any
light
which
there
was
not
he
heard
the
soft
flitting
of
bare
feet
for
a
delicate
sound
is
often
audible
in
a
din
when
a
loud
noise
is
obscured
then
a
gale
of
wind
blew
towards
him
as
from
an
open
door
and
far
away
gleamed
the
flickering
light
of
a
lantern
suddenly
the
light
disappeared
and
there
was
a
clatter
on
the
floor
and
a
breaking
of
glass
either
the
wind
or
thomas
yownie
the
verandah
door
was
shut
a
match
spluttered
and
the
lantern
was
relit
dobson
and
l√©on
came
into
the
hall
both
clad
in
long
mackintoshes
which
glistened
from
the
weather
dobson
halted
and
listened
to
the
wind
howling
in
the
upper
spaces
he
cursed
it
bitterly
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
made
an
observation
which
woke
the
liveliest
interest
in
dickson
lurking
beside
the
awmry
and
heritage
ensconced
in
the
shadow
of
a
he
late
he
should
have
been
here
five
minutes
syne
it
would
be
a
dirty
road
for
his
car
so
the
unknown
was
coming
that
night
the
news
made
dickson
the
more
resolved
to
get
the
watchers
under
lock
and
key
before
reinforcements
arrived
and
so
put
grit
in
their
wheels
then
his
party
must
escape
flee
anywhere
so
long
as
it
was
far
from
dalquharter
you
stop
here
said
dobson
i
go
down
and
let
spidel
in
we
want
another
lamp
get
the
one
that
the
women
use
and
for
god
sake
get
a
move
on
the
sound
of
his
feet
died
in
the
kitchen
passage
and
then
rung
again
on
the
stone
stairs
dickson
ear
of
faith
heard
also
the
soft
patter
of
naked
feet
as
the
preceded
and
followed
him
he
was
delivering
himself
blind
and
bound
into
their
hands
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
sound
but
the
wind
which
had
found
a
loose
chimney
cowl
on
the
roof
and
screwed
out
of
it
an
odd
sound
like
the
drone
of
a
bagpipe
dickson
unable
to
remain
any
longer
in
one
place
moved
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
believing
that
l√©on
had
gone
to
the
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
for
suddenly
a
match
was
lit
a
yard
from
him
he
had
the
sense
to
drop
low
and
so
was
out
of
the
main
glare
of
the
light
the
man
with
the
match
apparently
had
no
more
judging
by
his
execrations
dickson
stood
stock
still
longing
for
the
wind
to
fall
so
that
he
might
hear
the
sound
of
the
fellow
boots
on
the
stone
floor
he
gathered
that
they
were
moving
towards
the
heritage
he
whispered
as
loud
as
he
dared
but
there
was
no
answer
then
suddenly
a
moving
body
collided
with
him
he
jumped
a
step
back
and
then
stood
at
attention
is
that
you
dobson
a
voice
asked
now
behold
the
occasional
advantage
of
a
nickname
dickson
thought
he
was
being
addressed
as
dogson
after
the
poet
fashion
had
he
dreamed
it
was
l√©on
he
would
not
have
replied
but
fluttered
off
into
the
shadows
and
so
missed
a
piece
of
vital
news
ay
it
me
he
whispered
his
voice
and
accent
were
scotch
like
dobson
and
l√©on
suspected
nothing
i
do
not
like
this
wind
he
grumbled
the
captain
letter
said
at
dawn
but
there
is
no
chance
of
the
danish
brig
making
your
little
harbour
in
this
weather
she
must
lie
off
and
land
the
men
by
boats
that
i
do
not
like
it
is
too
public
the
news
tremendous
news
for
it
told
that
the
would
come
by
sea
which
had
never
before
entered
dickson
head
so
interested
him
that
he
stood
dumb
and
ruminating
the
silence
made
the
belgian
suspect
he
put
out
a
hand
and
felt
a
waterproofed
arm
which
might
have
been
dobson
but
the
height
of
the
shoulder
proved
that
it
was
not
the
burly
innkeeper
there
was
an
oath
a
quick
movement
and
dickson
went
down
with
a
knee
on
his
chest
and
two
hands
at
his
throat
heritage
he
gasped
help
there
was
a
sound
of
furniture
scraped
violently
on
the
floor
a
gurgle
from
dickson
served
as
a
guide
and
the
poet
suddenly
cascaded
over
the
combatants
he
felt
for
a
head
found
l√©on
and
gripped
the
neck
so
savagely
that
the
owner
loosened
his
hold
on
dickson
the
found
himself
being
buffeted
violently
by
feet
which
seemed
to
be
manoeuvring
before
an
unseen
enemy
he
rolled
out
of
the
road
and
encountered
another
pair
of
feet
this
time
unshod
then
came
a
sound
of
a
concussion
as
if
metal
or
wood
had
struck
some
part
of
a
human
frame
and
then
a
stumble
and
fall
after
that
a
good
many
things
all
seemed
to
happen
at
once
there
was
a
sudden
light
which
showed
l√©on
blinking
with
a
short
loaded
in
his
hand
and
heritage
prone
in
front
of
him
on
the
floor
it
also
showed
dickson
the
figure
of
dougal
and
more
than
one
in
the
background
the
light
went
out
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
there
was
a
whistle
and
a
hoarse
come
on
men
and
then
for
two
seconds
there
was
a
desperate
silent
combat
it
ended
with
head
meeting
the
floor
so
violently
that
its
possessor
became
oblivious
of
further
proceedings
he
was
dragged
into
a
which
had
once
been
used
for
coats
and
rugs
and
the
door
locked
on
him
then
the
light
sprang
forth
again
it
revealed
dougal
and
five
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
it
revealed
also
dickson
squatted
with
outspread
waterproof
very
like
a
sitting
hen
where
dobson
he
asked
in
the
and
for
once
dougal
gravity
had
laughter
in
it
govey
dick
but
yon
was
a
fecht
me
and
peter
paterson
and
wee
jaikie
started
it
but
it
was
the
whole
company
afore
the
end
are
ye
better
jaikie
ay
i
better
said
a
pallid
midget
he
kickit
jaikie
in
the
stomach
and
jaikie
was
seeck
dougal
explained
that
the
three
accounted
for
now
they
safe
for
five
hours
at
the
least
i
think
mysel
that
dobson
will
be
the
first
to
get
out
but
he
have
his
work
letting
out
the
others
now
i
for
flittin
to
the
old
tower
they
no
ken
where
we
are
for
a
long
time
and
anyway
yon
place
will
be
far
easier
to
defend
without
they
kindle
a
fire
and
smoke
us
out
i
do
see
how
they
beat
us
our
provisions
are
a
there
and
there
a
grand
well
o
water
inside
forbye
the
road
down
the
rocks
that
keep
our
communications
open
but
what
come
to
mr
heritage
dickson
to
his
shame
had
forgotten
all
about
his
friend
the
poet
lay
very
quiet
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
legs
crooked
limply
blood
trickled
over
his
eyes
from
an
ugly
scar
on
his
forehead
dickson
felt
his
heart
and
pulse
and
found
them
faint
but
regular
the
man
had
got
a
swinging
blow
and
might
have
a
slight
concussion
for
the
present
he
was
unconscious
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
flit
said
dougal
what
d
say
mr
mccunn
flit
of
course
but
further
than
the
old
tower
what
the
time
he
lifted
heritage
wrist
and
saw
from
his
watch
that
it
was
three
mercy
it
nearly
morning
afore
we
put
these
blagyirds
away
they
were
conversing
at
least
l√©on
and
dobson
were
they
said
that
they
expected
somebody
every
moment
but
that
the
car
would
be
late
still
got
that
somebody
to
tackle
then
l√©on
spoke
to
me
in
the
dark
thinking
i
was
dobson
and
cursed
the
wind
saying
it
would
keep
the
danish
brig
from
getting
in
at
dawn
as
had
been
intended
see
what
that
means
the
worst
of
the
lot
the
ones
the
ladies
are
in
terror
of
are
coming
by
sea
ay
and
they
can
return
by
sea
we
thought
that
the
attack
would
be
by
land
and
that
even
if
they
succeeded
we
could
hang
on
to
their
heels
and
follow
them
till
we
got
them
stopped
but
impossible
if
they
come
in
from
the
water
they
can
go
out
by
the
water
and
there
never
be
more
heard
tell
of
the
ladies
or
of
you
or
me
dougal
face
was
once
again
sunk
in
gloom
what
your
plan
then
we
must
get
the
ladies
away
from
here
away
inland
far
from
the
sea
the
rest
of
us
must
stand
a
siege
in
the
old
tower
so
that
the
enemy
will
think
we
all
there
please
god
we
hold
out
long
enough
for
help
to
arrive
but
we
must
hang
about
here
there
the
man
dobson
mentioned
he
may
come
any
second
and
we
want
to
be
away
first
get
the
ladder
dougal
four
of
you
take
heritage
and
two
come
with
me
and
carry
the
ladies
things
it
no
raining
but
the
wind
enough
to
take
the
wings
off
a
seagull
dickson
roused
saskia
and
her
cousin
bidding
them
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
then
with
the
help
of
the
he
proceeded
to
transport
the
necessary
supplies
the
stove
oil
dishes
clothes
and
wraps
more
than
one
journey
was
needed
of
small
boys
hidden
under
clouds
of
baggage
when
everything
had
gone
he
collected
the
keys
behind
which
in
various
quarters
of
the
house
three
gaolers
fumed
impotently
and
gave
them
to
wee
jaikie
to
dispose
of
in
some
secret
nook
then
he
led
the
two
ladies
to
the
verandah
the
elder
cross
and
sleepy
the
younger
alert
at
the
prospect
of
movement
tell
me
again
she
said
you
have
locked
all
the
three
up
and
they
are
now
the
imprisoned
well
it
was
the
boys
that
properly
speaking
did
the
locking
up
it
is
a
great
how
do
you
say
a
turning
of
the
tables
ah
what
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
verandah
there
was
a
clattering
down
of
pots
which
could
not
be
due
to
the
wind
since
the
place
was
sheltered
there
was
still
only
the
faintest
hint
of
light
and
black
night
still
lurked
in
the
crannies
followed
another
fall
of
pots
as
from
a
clumsy
intruder
and
then
a
man
appeared
clear
against
the
glass
door
by
which
the
path
descended
to
the
rock
garden
it
was
the
fourth
man
whom
the
three
prisoners
had
awaited
dickson
had
no
doubt
at
all
about
his
identity
he
was
that
villain
from
whom
all
the
others
took
their
orders
the
man
whom
the
princess
shuddered
at
before
starting
he
had
loaded
his
pistol
now
he
tugged
it
from
his
waterproof
pocket
pointed
it
at
the
other
and
fired
the
man
seemed
to
be
hit
for
he
spun
round
and
clapped
a
hand
to
his
left
arm
then
he
fled
through
the
door
which
he
left
open
dickson
was
after
him
like
a
hound
at
the
door
he
saw
him
running
and
raised
his
pistol
for
another
shot
then
he
dropped
it
for
he
saw
something
in
the
crouching
dodging
figure
which
was
familiar
a
mistake
he
explained
to
jaikie
when
he
returned
but
the
shot
was
wasted
i
just
had
a
good
try
at
killing
the
factor
chapter
x
deals
with
an
escape
and
a
journey
five
scouts
lanterns
burned
smokily
in
the
ground
room
of
the
keep
when
dickson
ushered
his
charges
through
its
cavernous
door
the
lights
flickered
in
the
gusts
that
swept
after
them
and
whistled
through
the
slits
of
window
so
that
the
place
was
full
of
monstrous
shadows
and
its
accustomed
odour
of
mould
and
disuse
was
changed
to
a
salty
freshness
upstairs
on
the
first
floor
thomas
yownie
had
deposited
the
ladies
baggage
and
was
busy
making
beds
out
of
derelict
iron
bedsteads
and
the
wraps
brought
from
their
room
on
the
ground
floor
on
a
heap
of
litter
covered
by
an
old
scout
blanket
lay
heritage
with
dougal
in
attendance
the
chieftain
had
washed
the
blood
from
the
poet
brow
and
the
touch
of
cold
water
was
bringing
back
his
senses
saskia
with
a
cry
flew
to
him
and
waved
off
dickson
who
had
fetched
one
of
the
bottles
of
liqueur
brandy
she
slipped
a
hand
inside
his
shirt
and
felt
the
beating
of
his
heart
then
her
slim
fingers
ran
over
his
forehead
a
bad
blow
she
muttered
but
i
do
not
think
he
is
ill
there
is
no
fracture
when
i
nursed
in
the
alexander
hospital
i
learnt
much
about
head
wounds
do
not
give
him
cognac
if
you
value
his
life
heritage
was
talking
now
and
with
strange
tongues
phrases
like
lined
digesters
and
free
sulphurous
acid
came
from
his
lips
he
implored
some
one
to
tell
him
if
the
first
cook
was
finished
and
he
upbraided
some
one
else
for
cooling
off
too
fast
the
girl
raised
her
head
but
i
fear
he
has
become
mad
she
said
wheesht
mem
said
dickson
who
recognised
the
jargon
he
a
paper
maker
saskia
sat
down
on
the
litter
and
lifted
his
head
so
that
it
rested
on
her
breast
dougal
at
her
bidding
brought
a
certain
case
from
her
baggage
and
with
swift
capable
hands
she
made
a
bandage
and
rubbed
the
wound
with
ointment
before
tying
it
up
then
her
fingers
seemed
to
play
about
his
temples
and
along
his
cheeks
and
neck
she
was
the
professional
nurse
now
absorbed
sexless
heritage
ceased
to
babble
his
eyes
shut
and
he
was
asleep
she
remained
where
she
was
so
that
the
poet
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
woke
found
himself
lying
with
his
head
in
her
lap
she
spoke
first
in
an
imperative
tone
you
are
well
now
your
head
does
not
ache
you
are
strong
again
no
yes
he
murmured
then
more
clearly
where
am
i
oh
i
remember
i
caught
a
lick
on
the
head
what
become
of
the
brutes
dickson
who
had
extracted
food
from
the
mearns
street
box
and
was
pressing
it
on
the
others
replied
through
a
mouthful
of
biscuit
in
the
old
tower
the
three
are
lockit
up
in
the
house
are
you
feeling
better
mr
heritage
the
poet
suddenly
realised
saskia
position
and
the
blood
came
to
his
pale
face
he
got
to
his
feet
with
an
effort
and
held
out
a
hand
to
the
girl
i
all
right
now
i
think
only
a
little
dicky
on
my
legs
a
thousand
thanks
princess
i
given
you
a
lot
of
trouble
she
smiled
at
him
tenderly
you
say
that
when
you
have
risked
your
life
for
me
there
no
time
to
waste
the
relentless
dougal
broke
in
comin
over
here
i
heard
a
shot
what
was
it
it
was
me
said
dickson
i
was
shootin
at
the
factor
did
ye
hit
him
i
think
so
but
i
sorry
to
say
not
badly
when
i
last
saw
him
he
was
running
too
quick
for
a
sore
hurt
man
when
i
fired
i
thought
it
was
the
other
man
the
one
they
were
expecting
dickson
marvelled
at
himself
yet
his
speech
was
not
bravado
but
the
honest
expression
of
his
mind
he
was
keyed
up
to
a
mood
in
which
he
feared
nothing
very
much
certainly
not
the
laws
of
his
country
if
he
fell
in
with
the
unknown
he
was
entirely
resolved
if
his
maker
permitted
him
to
do
murder
as
being
the
simplest
and
justest
solution
and
if
in
the
pursuit
of
this
laudable
intention
he
happened
to
wing
lesser
game
it
was
no
fault
of
his
well
it
a
pity
ye
did
get
him
said
dougal
him
being
what
we
ken
him
to
be
i
for
holding
a
council
o
war
and
considerin
the
whole
position
so
far
we
have
done
that
badly
we
shifted
our
base
without
serious
casualties
we
got
a
far
better
position
to
hold
for
there
too
many
ways
into
yon
hoose
and
here
there
just
one
besides
we
fickled
the
enemy
they
take
some
time
to
find
out
where
we
gone
but
mind
you
we
ca
count
on
their
staying
long
shut
up
dobson
no
safe
in
the
for
there
a
skylight
far
up
and
he
see
it
when
the
light
comes
and
maybe
before
so
we
better
get
our
plans
ready
a
word
with
ye
mccunn
and
he
led
dickson
aside
d
ken
what
these
blagyirds
were
up
to
he
whispered
fiercely
in
dickson
ear
they
were
goin
to
pushion
the
lassie
how
do
i
ken
says
you
because
thomas
yownie
heard
dobson
say
to
lean
at
the
scullery
door
ye
got
the
dope
he
says
and
lean
says
thomas
mindit
the
word
for
he
had
heard
about
it
at
the
picters
dickson
exclaimed
in
horror
what
d
make
o
that
i
tell
ye
they
wanted
to
make
sure
of
her
but
they
would
have
thought
o
dope
unless
the
men
they
expectit
were
due
to
arrive
any
moment
as
i
see
it
we
to
face
a
siege
not
by
the
three
but
by
a
dozen
or
more
and
it
no
be
long
till
it
starts
now
is
it
a
mercy
we
safe
in
here
dickson
returned
to
the
others
with
a
grave
face
where
think
the
new
folk
are
coming
from
he
asked
heritage
answered
from
auchenlochan
i
suppose
or
perhaps
down
from
the
hills
you
wrong
and
he
told
of
l√©on
mistaken
confidences
to
him
in
the
darkness
they
are
coming
from
the
sea
just
like
the
old
pirates
the
sea
heritage
repeated
in
a
dazed
voice
ay
the
sea
think
what
that
means
if
they
had
been
coming
by
the
roads
we
could
have
kept
track
of
them
even
if
they
beat
us
and
some
of
these
laddies
could
have
stuck
to
them
and
followed
them
up
till
help
came
it
ca
be
such
an
easy
job
to
carry
a
young
lady
against
her
will
along
scotch
roads
but
the
sea
a
different
matter
if
got
a
fast
boat
they
could
be
out
of
the
firth
and
away
beyond
the
law
before
we
could
wake
up
a
single
policeman
ay
and
even
if
the
government
took
it
up
and
warned
all
the
ports
and
ships
at
sea
to
hinder
them
to
find
a
about
ireland
or
norway
i
tell
you
it
a
far
more
desperate
business
than
i
thought
and
it
no
do
to
wait
on
and
trust
that
the
chief
constable
will
turn
up
afore
the
mischief
done
the
moral
said
heritage
is
that
there
can
be
no
surrender
got
to
stick
it
out
in
this
old
place
at
all
costs
no
said
dickson
emphatically
the
moral
is
that
we
must
shift
the
ladies
we
got
the
chance
while
dobson
and
his
friends
are
locked
up
let
get
them
as
far
away
as
we
can
from
the
sea
they
far
safer
tramping
the
moors
and
it
no
likely
the
new
folk
will
dare
to
follow
us
but
i
can
not
go
saskia
who
had
been
listening
intently
shook
her
head
i
promised
to
wait
here
till
my
friend
came
if
i
leave
i
shall
never
find
him
if
you
stay
you
certainly
never
will
for
you
be
away
with
the
ruffians
take
a
sensible
view
mem
you
be
no
good
to
your
friend
or
your
friend
to
you
if
before
night
you
rocking
in
a
ship
the
girl
shook
her
head
again
gently
but
decisively
it
was
our
arrangement
i
can
not
break
it
besides
i
am
sure
that
he
will
come
in
time
for
he
has
never
failed
there
was
a
desperate
finality
about
the
quiet
tones
and
the
weary
face
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
it
then
heritage
spoke
i
do
think
your
plan
will
quite
do
dogson
supposing
we
all
break
for
the
hinterland
and
the
danish
brig
finds
the
birds
flown
that
wo
end
the
trouble
they
will
get
on
the
trail
and
the
whole
persecution
will
start
again
i
want
to
see
things
brought
to
a
head
here
and
now
if
we
can
stick
it
out
here
long
enough
we
may
trap
the
whole
push
and
rid
the
world
of
a
pretty
gang
of
miscreants
once
let
them
show
their
hand
and
then
if
the
police
are
here
by
that
time
we
can
jug
the
lot
for
piracy
or
something
worse
that
all
right
said
dougal
but
we
put
up
a
better
fight
if
we
had
the
women
off
our
mind
i
aye
read
that
when
a
castle
was
going
to
be
besieged
the
first
thing
was
to
rid
get
of
the
civilians
sensible
to
the
last
dougal
said
dickson
approvingly
that
just
what
i
saying
i
strong
for
a
fight
but
put
the
ladies
in
a
safe
bit
first
for
they
our
weak
point
do
you
think
that
if
you
were
fighting
my
enemies
i
would
consent
to
be
absent
came
saskia
reproachful
question
no
mem
said
dickson
heartily
his
martial
spirit
was
with
heritage
but
his
prudence
did
not
sleep
and
he
suddenly
saw
a
way
of
placating
both
just
you
listen
to
what
i
propose
what
do
we
amount
to
heritage
six
laddies
and
myself
and
i
no
more
used
to
fighting
than
an
old
wife
we
seven
desperate
villains
against
us
and
afore
night
they
may
be
seventy
we
a
fine
old
castle
here
but
for
defence
we
want
more
than
stone
walls
we
want
a
garrison
i
tell
you
we
must
get
help
somewhere
ay
but
how
says
you
well
coming
here
i
noticed
a
gentleman
house
away
up
ayont
the
railway
and
close
to
the
hills
the
laird
maybe
not
at
home
but
there
will
be
men
there
of
some
kind
gamekeepers
and
woodmen
and
such
like
my
plan
is
to
go
there
at
once
and
ask
for
help
now
it
useless
me
going
alone
for
nobody
would
listen
to
me
they
tell
me
to
go
back
to
the
shop
or
think
me
demented
but
with
you
mem
it
would
be
a
different
matter
they
would
disbelieve
you
so
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
and
to
come
at
once
for
god
knows
how
soon
our
need
will
be
sore
we
leave
your
cousin
with
morran
in
the
village
for
bed
the
place
for
her
and
then
you
and
me
will
be
off
on
our
business
the
girl
looked
at
heritage
who
nodded
it
the
only
way
he
said
get
every
man
jack
you
can
raise
and
if
it
humanly
possible
get
a
gun
or
two
i
believe
there
time
enough
for
i
do
see
the
brig
arriving
in
broad
daylight
not
dickson
asked
rudely
have
you
considered
what
day
this
is
it
the
sabbath
the
best
of
days
for
an
ill
deed
there
no
kirk
hereaways
and
everybody
in
the
parish
will
be
sitting
indoors
by
the
fire
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
half
an
hour
it
be
light
haste
you
mem
and
get
ready
dougal
what
the
weather
the
chieftain
swung
open
the
door
and
sniffed
the
air
the
wind
had
fallen
for
the
time
being
and
the
surge
of
the
tides
below
the
rocks
rose
like
the
clamour
of
a
mob
with
the
lull
mist
and
a
thin
drizzle
had
cloaked
the
world
again
to
dickson
surprise
dougal
seemed
to
be
in
good
spirits
he
began
to
sing
to
a
hymn
tune
a
strange
ditty
we
are
and
wull
be
till
our
fit
on
the
neck
o
the
boorjoyzee
what
on
earth
are
you
singing
dickson
inquired
dougal

wee
jaikie
went
to
a
socialist
sunday
school
last
winter
because
he
heard
they
were
for
fechtin
battles
ay
and
they
telled
him
he
was
to
jine
a
thing
called
an
international
and
jaikie
thought
it
was
a
fitba
club
but
when
he
fund
out
there
was
no
magic
lantern
or
swaree
at
christmas
he
gie
it
the
chuck
they
learned
him
a
heap
o
queer
songs
that
one
what
does
the
last
word
mean
i
do
ken
jaikie
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
a
draigon
it
a
thing
anyway
when
high
water
dougal
answered
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
it
fell
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
then
that
when
we
may
expect
the
foreign
gentry
if
they
think
to
bring
their
boat
in
to
the
garple
foot
dougal
lad
i
trust
you
to
keep
a
most
careful
and
prayerful
watch
you
had
better
get
the
out
of
the
tower
and
all
round
the
place
afore
dobson
and
get
loose
or
you
no
get
a
chance
later
do
lose
your
mobility
as
the
sodgers
say
heritage
can
hold
the
fort
but
you
laddies
should
be
spread
out
like
a
screen
that
was
my
notion
said
dougal
i
detail
two
thomas
yownie
and
wee
jaikie
to
keep
in
touch
with
ye
and
watch
for
ye
back
thomas
ye
ken
already
ye
no
fickle
thomas
yownie
but
do
be
mistook
about
wee
jaikie
he
terrible
fond
of
greetin
but
it
no
fright
with
him
but
excitement
it
just
a
habit
he
gotten
when
ye
see
jaikie
begin
to
greet
ye
may
be
sure
that
jaikie
dangerous
the
door
shut
behind
them
and
dickson
found
himself
with
his
two
charges
in
a
world
dim
with
fog
and
rain
and
the
still
lingering
darkness
the
air
was
raw
and
had
the
sour
smell
which
comes
from
soaked
earth
and
wet
boughs
when
the
leaves
are
not
yet
fledged
both
the
women
were
miserably
equipped
for
such
an
expedition
cousin
eug√®nie
trailed
heavy
furs
saskia
only
wrap
was
a
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
both
wore
thin
foreign
shoes
dickson
insisted
on
stripping
off
his
trusty
waterproof
and
forcing
it
on
the
princess
on
whose
slim
body
it
hung
very
loose
and
very
short
the
elder
woman
stumbled
and
whimpered
and
needed
the
constant
support
of
his
arm
walking
like
a
townswoman
from
the
knees
but
saskia
swung
from
the
hips
like
a
free
woman
and
dickson
had
much
ado
to
keep
up
with
her
she
seemed
to
delight
in
the
bitter
freshness
of
the
dawn
inhaling
deep
breaths
of
it
and
humming
fragments
of
a
tune
guided
by
thomas
yownie
they
took
the
road
which
dickson
and
heritage
had
travelled
the
first
evening
through
the
shrubberies
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
and
the
side
avenue
beyond
which
the
ground
fell
to
the
laver
glen
on
their
right
the
house
rose
like
a
dark
cloud
but
dickson
had
lost
his
terror
of
it
there
were
three
angry
men
inside
it
he
remembered
long
let
them
stay
there
he
marvelled
at
his
mood
and
also
rejoiced
for
his
worst
fear
had
always
been
that
he
might
prove
a
coward
now
he
was
puzzled
to
think
how
he
could
ever
be
frightened
again
for
his
one
object
was
to
succeed
and
in
that
absorption
fear
seemed
to
him
merely
a
waste
of
time
it
all
comes
of
treating
the
thing
as
a
business
proposition
he
told
himself
but
there
was
far
more
in
his
heart
than
this
sober
resolution
he
was
intoxicated
with
the
resurgence
of
youth
and
felt
a
rapture
of
audacity
which
he
never
remembered
in
his
decorous
boyhood
i
have
been
doing
badly
for
an
old
man
he
reflected
with
glee
what
oh
what
had
become
of
the
pillar
of
commerce
the
man
who
might
have
been
a
bailie
had
he
sought
municipal
honours
the
elder
in
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
the
instructor
of
literary
young
men
in
the
past
three
days
he
had
levanted
with
jewels
which
had
once
been
an
emperor
and
certainly
were
not
his
he
had
burglariously
entered
and
made
free
of
a
strange
house
he
had
played
at
the
risk
of
his
neck
and
had
wrestled
in
the
dark
with
a
foreign
miscreant
he
had
shot
at
an
eminent
solicitor
with
intent
to
kill
and
he
was
now
engaged
in
tramping
the
world
with
a
princess
i
blush
to
confess
that
of
each
of
his
doings
he
was
unashamedly
proud
and
thirsted
for
many
more
in
the
same
line
gosh
but
i
seeing
life
was
his
unregenerate
conclusion
without
sight
or
sound
of
a
human
being
they
descended
to
the
laver
climbed
again
by
the
cart
track
and
passed
the
deserted
west
lodge
and
inn
to
the
village
it
was
almost
full
dawn
when
the
three
stood
in
morran
kitchen
i
brought
you
two
ladies
auntie
phemie
said
dickson
they
made
an
odd
group
in
that
cheerful
place
where
the
fire
was
crackling
in
the
big
grate
the
wet
undignified
form
of
dickson
unshaven
of
cheek
and
chin
and
disreputable
in
garb
the
shrouded
figure
of
cousin
eug√®nie
who
had
sunk
into
the
and
closed
her
eyes
the
slim
girl
into
whose
face
the
weather
had
whipped
a
glow
like
blossom
and
the
hostess
with
her
petticoats
kilted
and
an
ancient
mutch
on
her
head
morran
looked
once
at
saskia
and
then
did
a
thing
which
she
had
not
done
since
her
girlhood
she
curtseyed
i
proud
to
see
ye
here
mem
off
wi
your
things
and
i
get
ye
dry
claes
losh
ye
fair
soppin
and

to
the
loft
and
dinna
you
stir
till
i
give

a
cry
the
leddies
will
change
by
the
fire
and
you

place

a
jiffy
and
syne

breakfast
ye
hae
a
cup
tea
wi
me
now
for
the
kettle
just
on
the
boil
awa
wi
ye
dickson
and
she
stamped
her
foot
dickson
departed
and
in
the
loft
washed
his
face
and
smoked
a
pipe
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
watching
the
mist
eddying
up
the
village
street
from
below
rose
the
sounds
of
hospitable
bustle
and
when
after
some
twenty
minutes
vigil
he
descended
he
found
saskia
toasting
stockinged
toes
by
the
fire
in
the
great
and
morran
setting
the
table
auntie
phemie
hearken
to
me
we
taken
on
too
big
a
job
for
two
men
and
six
laddies
and
help
we
got
to
get
and
that
this
very
morning
mind
the
big
white
house
away
up
near
the
hills
ayont
the
station
and
east
of
the
ayr
road
it
looked
like
a
gentleman
shooting
lodge
i
was
thinking
of
trying
there
mercy
the
exclamation
was
wrung
from
him
by
his
eyes
settling
on
saskia
and
noting
her
apparel
gone
were
her
thin
foreign
clothes
and
in
their
place
she
wore
a
heavy
tweed
skirt
cut
very
short
and
thick
homespun
stockings
which
had
been
made
for
some
one
with
larger
feet
than
hers
a
pair
of
the
coarse
shoes
which
country
folk
wear
in
the
farmyard
stood
warming
by
the
hearth
she
still
had
her
russet
jumper
but
round
her
neck
hung
a
grey
wool
scarf
of
the
kind
known
as
a
comforter
amazingly
pretty
she
looked
in
dickson
eyes
but
with
a
different
kind
of
prettiness
the
sense
of
fragility
had
fled
and
he
saw
how
nobly
built
she
was
for
all
her
exquisiteness
she
looked
like
a
queen
he
thought
but
a
queen
to
go
gipsying
through
the
world
with
ay
they
some
o
elspeth
things
rale
guid
furthy
claes
said
morran
complacently
and
the
shoon
are
what
she
used
to
gang
about
the
byres
wi
when
she
was
in
the
castlewham
dairy
the
leddy
was
tellin
me
she
was
for
trampin
the
hills
and
thae
things
will
keep
her
dry
and
warm
i
ken
the
hoose
ye
mean
they
ca
it
the
mains
of
garple
and
i
ken
the
man
that
bides
in
it
he
yin
sir
erchibald
roylance
english
but
his
mither
was
a
dalziel
i
no
weel
acquaint
wi
his
forbears
but
i
weel
eneuch
acquaint
wi
sir
erchie
and
a
guid
coo
than
a
coo
o
a
guid
kind
as
my
mither
used
to
say
he
used
to
be
an
awfu
wild
callant
a
freend
o
puir
maister
quentin
and
up
to
ony
deevilry
but
they
tell
me

quieter
lad
since
the
war
and
sair
lamed
by
oot
o
an
airyplane
will
he
be
at
the
mains
just
now
dickson
asked
i
wadna
wonder
he
has
a
muckle
place
in
england
but
he
aye
used
to
come
here
in
the
for
the
shootin
and
in
aprile
for
birds
clean
daft
about
birds
he
be
out
a
day
at
the
craig
solans
or
lyin
a
mornin
i
the
moss
lookin
at
will
he
help
think
you
i
wager
he
help
onyway
it
your
best
chance
and
better
a
wee
bush
than
nae
beild
now
sit
in
to
your
breakfast
it
was
a
merry
meal
morran
dispensed
tea
and
gnomic
wisdom
saskia
ate
heartily
speaking
little
but
once
or
twice
laying
her
hand
softly
on
her
hostess
gnarled
fingers
dickson
was
in
such
spirits
that
he
gobbled
shamelessly
being
both
hungry
and
hurried
and
he
spoke
of
the
still
unconquered
enemy
with
ease
and
disrespect
so
that
morran
was
moved
to
observe
that
there
was
naething
sae
bauld
as
a
blind
mear
but
when
in
a
sudden
return
of
modesty
he
belittled
his
usefulness
and
talked
sombrely
of
his
mature
years
he
was
told
that
he
wad
never
be
auld
wi
sae
muckle
honesty
indeed
it
was
very
clear
that
morran
approved
of
her
nephew
they
did
not
linger
over
breakfast
for
both
were
impatient
to
be
on
the
road
morran
assisted
saskia
to
put
on
elspeth
shoes
a
young
fit
finds
comfort
in
an
auld
bauchle
as
my
mother
honest
woman
used
to
say
dickson
waterproof
was
restored
to
him
and
for
saskia
an
old
raincoat
belonging
to
the
son
in
south
africa
was
discovered
which
fitted
her
better
siccan
weather
said
the
hostess
as
she
opened
the
door
to
let
in
a
swirl
of
wind
the
deil
aye
kind
to
his
ain
haste
ye
back
mem
and
be
sure
i
tak
guid
care
o
your
leddy
cousin
the
proper
way
to
the
mains
of
garple
was
either
by
the
station
and
the
ayr
road
or
by
the
auchenlochan
highway
branching
off
half
a
mile
beyond
the
garple
bridge
but
dickson
who
had
been
studying
the
map
and
fancied
himself
as
a
pathfinder
chose
the
direct
route
across
the
long
muir
as
being
at
once
shorter
and
more
sequestered
with
the
dawn
the
wind
had
risen
again
but
it
had
shifted
towards
the
and
was
many
degrees
colder
the
mist
was
furling
on
the
hills
like
sails
the
rain
had
ceased
and
out
at
sea
the
eye
covered
a
mile
or
two
of
wild
water
the
moor
was
drenching
wet
and
the
peat
bogs
were
brimming
with
inky
pools
so
that
soon
the
travellers
were
soaked
to
the
knees
dickson
had
no
fear
of
pursuit
for
he
calculated
that
dobson
and
his
friends
even
if
they
had
got
out
would
be
busy
looking
for
the
truants
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
and
would
presently
be
engaged
with
the
old
tower
but
he
realised
too
that
speed
on
his
errand
was
vital
for
at
any
moment
the
unknown
might
arrive
from
the
sea
so
he
kept
up
a
good
pace
till
they
had
passed
the
railway
and
he
found
himself
gasping
with
a
stitch
in
his
side
and
compelled
to
rest
in
the
lee
of
what
had
once
been
a
sheepfold
saskia
amazed
him
she
moved
over
the
rough
heather
like
a
deer
and
it
was
her
hand
that
helped
him
across
the
deeper
hags
before
such
youth
and
vigour
he
felt
clumsy
and
old
she
stood
looking
down
at
him
as
he
recovered
his
breath
cool
unruffled
alert
as
diana
his
mind
fled
to
heritage
and
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
the
poet
had
set
his
affections
very
high
loyalty
drove
him
to
speak
a
word
for
his
friend
i
got
the
easy
job
he
said
heritage
will
have
the
whole
pack
on
him
in
that
old
tower
and
him
with
such
a
sore
clout
on
his
head
i
left
him
my
pistol
he
a
terrible
brave
man
she
smiled
ay
and
he
a
poet
too
so
she
said
i
did
not
know
he
is
very
young
he
a
man
of
very
high
ideels
she
puzzled
at
the
word
and
then
smiled
i
know
him
he
is
like
many
of
our
young
men
in
russia
the
students
his
mind
is
in
a
ferment
and
he
does
not
know
what
he
wants
but
he
is
brave
this
seemed
to
dickson
loyal
soul
but
a
chilly
tribute
i
think
he
is
in
love
with
me
she
continued
he
looked
up
startled
and
saw
in
her
face
that
which
gave
him
a
view
into
a
strange
new
world
he
had
thought
that
women
blushed
when
they
talked
of
love
but
her
eyes
were
as
grave
and
candid
as
a
boy
here
was
one
who
had
gone
through
waters
so
deep
that
she
had
lost
the
foibles
of
sex
love
to
her
was
only
a
word
of
ill
omen
a
threat
on
the
lips
of
brutes
an
extra
battalion
of
peril
in
an
army
of
perplexities
he
felt
like
some
homely
rustic
who
finds
himself
swept
unwittingly
into
the
moonlight
hunt
of
artemis
and
her
maidens
he
is
a
romantic
she
said
i
have
known
so
many
like
him
he
no
that
said
dickson
shortly
why
he
used
to
be
aye
laughing
at
me
for
being
romantic
he
one
that
looking
for
truth
and
reality
he
says
and
he
terrible
down
on
the
kind
of
poetry
i
like
myself
she
smiled
they
all
talk
so
but
you
my
friend
dickson
she
pronounced
the
name
in
two
staccato
syllables
ever
so
prettily
you
are
different
tell
me
about
yourself
i
just
what
you
see
a
retired
grocer
grocer
she
queried
ah
yes
but
you
are
a
very
remarkable
heritage
i
understand
but
you
and
those
little
boys
no
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
you
are
not
a
romantic
you
are
too
humorous
and
and
i
think
you
are
like
ulysses
for
it
would
not
be
easy
to
defeat
you
her
eyes
were
kind
nay
affectionate
and
dickson
experienced
a
preposterous
rapture
in
his
soul
followed
by
a
sinking
as
he
realised
how
far
the
job
was
still
from
being
completed
we
must
be
getting
on
mem
he
said
hastily
and
the
two
plunged
again
into
the
heather
the
ayr
road
was
crossed
and
the
fir
wood
around
the
mains
became
visible
and
presently
the
white
gates
of
the
entrance
a
spire
of
smoke
beyond
the
trees
proclaimed
that
the
house
was
not
untenanted
as
they
entered
the
drive
the
scots
firs
were
tossing
in
the
gale
which
blew
fiercely
at
this
altitude
but
the
dwelling
itself
being
more
in
the
hollow
the
daffodil
clumps
on
the
lawn
were
but
mildly
fluttered
the
door
was
opened
by
a
butler
who
bore
all
the
marks
of
the
old
regular
soldier
dickson
produced
a
card
and
asked
to
see
his
master
on
urgent
business
sir
archibald
was
at
home
he
was
told
and
had
just
finished
breakfast
the
two
were
led
into
a
large
bare
chamber
which
had
all
the
chill
and
mustiness
of
a
bachelor
the
butler
returned
and
said
sir
archibald
would
see
him
i
better
go
myself
first
and
prepare
the
way
mem
dickson
whispered
and
followed
the
man
across
the
hall
he
found
himself
ushered
into
a
room
where
a
bright
fire
was
burning
on
a
table
lay
the
remains
of
breakfast
and
the
odour
of
food
mingled
pleasantly
with
the
scent
of
peat
the
horns
and
heads
of
big
game
foxes
masks
the
model
of
a
gigantic
salmon
and
several
bookcases
adorned
the
wall
and
books
and
maps
were
mixed
with
decanters
and
on
the
long
sideboard
after
the
wild
out
of
doors
the
place
seemed
the
very
shrine
of
comfort
a
young
man
sat
in
an
armchair
by
the
fire
with
a
leg
on
a
stool
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
and
reading
the
and
on
another
stool
at
his
elbow
was
a
pile
of
new
novels
he
was
a
pleasant
young
man
with
remarkably
smooth
hair
and
a
roving
humorous
eye

lady
ay
a
princess
she
in

next

the
young
man

wildly
at
him
and
waved
the
book
he
had
been
reading
excuse

time
of
day
it
more
absurd
than
this
shocker
i
been
readin
all
the
same
it
a
fact
she
tell
you
the
story
herself
and
believe
her
quick
enough
but
to
prepare
your
mind
i
just
give
you
a
sketch
of
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
before
the
sketch
was
concluded
the
young
man
had
violently
rung
the
bell
sime
he
shouted
to
the
servant
clear
away
this
mess
and
lay
the
table
again
order
more
breakfast
all
the
breakfast
you
can
get
open
the
windows
and
get
the
tobacco
smoke
out
of
the
air
tidy
up
the
place
for
there
a
lady
comin
quick
you
juggins
he
was
on
his
feet
now
and
with
his
arm
in
dickson
was
heading
for
the
door
my
sainted
aunt
and
you
topped
off
with
pottin
at
the
factor
seen
a
few
things
in
my
day
but
i
blessed
if
i
ever
met
a
bird
like
you
chapter
xi
gravity
out
of
bed
it
is
probable
that
sir
archibald
roylance
did
not
altogether
believe
dickson
tale
it
may
be
that
he
considered
him
an
agreeable
romancer
or
a
little
mad
or
no
more
than
a
relief
to
the
tedium
of
a
wet
sunday
morning
but
his
incredulity
did
not
survive
one
glance
at
saskia
as
she
stood
in
that
bleak
among
victorian
and
faded
chintzes
the
young
man
boyishness
deserted
him
he
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
and
made
a
profound
and
awkward
bow
i
am
at
your
service
mademoiselle
he
said
amazed
at
himself
the
words
seemed
to
have
come
out
of
a
confused
memory
of
plays
and
novels
she
inclined
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
looked
towards
dickson
sir
archibald
going
to
do
his
best
for
us
said
that
squire
of
dames
i
was
telling
him
that
we
had
had
our
breakfast
let
get
out
of
this
sepulchre
said
their
host
who
was
recovering
himself
there
a
roasting
fire
in
my
den
of
course
you
have
something
to
eat
hot
coffee
anyhow
i
trained
my
cook
to
make
coffee
like
a
frenchwoman
the
housekeeper
will
take
charge
of
you
if
you
want
to
tidy
up
and
you
must
excuse
our
ramshackle
ways
please
i
do
believe
there
ever
been
a
lady
in
this
house
before
you
know
he
led
her
to
the
and
ensconced
her
in
the
great
chair
by
the
fire
smilingly
she
refused
a
series
of
offers
which
ranged
from
a
sheepskin
mantle
which
he
had
got
in
the
pamirs
and
which
he
thought
might
fit
her
to
hot
whisky
and
water
as
a
specific
against
a
chill
but
she
accepted
a
pair
of
slippers
and
deftly
kicked
off
the
brogues
provided
by
morran
also
while
dickson
started
rapaciously
on
a
second
breakfast
she
allowed
him
to
pour
her
out
a
cup
of
coffee
you
are
a
soldier
she
asked
two
years
infantry
battalion
lennox
highlanders
and
then
flying
corps
time
i
had
too
till
the
day
before
the
armistice
when
my
luck
gave
out
and
i
took
a
nasty
toss
consequently
i
not
as
fast
on
my
legs
now
as
i
like
to
be
you
were
a
friend
of
captain
kennedy
his
oldest
we
were
at
the
same
private
school
and
he
was
at
tutor
and
we
were
never
much
separated
till
he
went
abroad
to
cram
for
the
diplomatic
and
i
started
east
to
shoot
things
then
i
will
tell
you
what
i
told
captain
kennedy
saskia
looking
into
the
heart
of
the
peats
began
the
story
of
which
we
have
already
heard
a
version
but
she
told
it
differently
for
she
was
telling
it
to
one
who
more
or
less
belonged
to
her
own
world
she
mentioned
names
at
which
the
other
nodded
she
spoke
of
a
certain
paul
abreskov
i
heard
of
him
at
bokhara
in
said
sir
archie
and
his
face
grew
solemn
sometimes
she
lapsed
into
french
and
her
hearer
brow
wrinkled
but
he
appeared
to
follow
when
she
had
finished
he
drew
a
long
breath
my
aunt
what
a
time
you
been
through
i
seen
pluck
in
my
day
but
yours
it
not
thinkable
mind
if
i
ask
a
question
princess
bolshevism
we
know
all
about
and
i
admit
trotsky
and
his
friends
are
a
pretty
effective
push
but
how
on
earth
have
they
got
a
graft
going
in
the
time
so
that
they
can
stretch
their
net
to
an
spot
like
this
it
looks
as
if
they
had
struck
a
napoleon
somewhere
you
do
not
understand
she
said
i
can
not
make
any
one
understand
except
a
russian
my
country
has
been
broken
to
pieces
and
there
is
no
law
in
it
therefore
it
is
a
nursery
of
crime
so
would
england
be
or
france
if
you
had
suffered
the
same
misfortunes
my
people
are
not
wickeder
than
others
but
for
the
moment
they
are
sick
and
have
no
strength
as
for
the
government
of
the
bolsheviki
it
matters
little
for
it
will
pass
some
parts
of
it
may
remain
but
it
is
a
government
of
the
sick
and
fevered
and
can
not
endure
in
health
lenin
may
be
a
good
man
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
do
not
know
but
if
he
were
an
archangel
he
could
not
alter
things
russia
is
mortally
sick
and
therefore
all
evil
is
unchained
and
the
criminals
have
no
one
to
check
them
there
is
crime
everywhere
in
the
world
and
the
unfettered
crime
in
russia
is
so
powerful
that
it
stretches
its
hand
to
crime
throughout
the
globe
and
there
is
a
great
mobilising
everywhere
of
wicked
men
once
you
boasted
that
law
was
international
and
that
the
police
in
one
land
worked
with
the
police
of
all
others
that
is
true
about
criminals
after
a
war
evil
passions
are
loosed
and
since
russia
is
broken
in
her
they
can
make
their
headquarters
it
is
not
bolshevism
the
theory
you
need
fear
for
that
is
a
weak
and
dying
thing
it
is
crime
which
finds
its
seat
in
my
country
but
is
not
only
russian
it
has
no
fatherland
it
is
as
old
as
human
nature
and
as
wide
as
the
earth
i
see
said
sir
archie
gad
here
have
i
been
vegetatin
and
that
all
excitement
had
gone
out
of
life
with
the
war
and
sometimes
even
regrettin
that
the
beastly
old
thing
was
over
and
all
the
while
the
world
fairly
hummin
with
interest
and
loudon
too
i
would
like
your
candid
opinion
on
yon
factor
sir
archibald
said
dickson
i
ca
say
i
ever
liked
him
and
i
once
or
twice
had
a
row
with
him
for
he
used
to
bring
his
pals
to
shoot
over
dalquharter
and
he
did
quite
play
the
game
by
me
but
i
know
dashed
little
about
him
for
i
been
a
lot
away
bit
hairy
about
the
heels
of
course
a
great
figure
at
local
and
used
to
toady
old
carforth
and
the
huntin
crowd
he
has
a
pretty
big
reputation
as
a
sharp
lawyer
and
some
of
the
lairds
swear
by
him
but
quentin
never
could
stick
him
it
quite
likely
he
been
gettin
into
queer
street
for
he
was
always
speculatin
in
and
i
fancy
he
plunged
a
bit
on
the
turf
but
i
ca
think
how
he
got
mixed
up
in
this
show
i
positive
dobson
his
brother
and
put
this
business
in
his
way
that
would
explain
it
all
right
he
must
be
runnin
for
pretty
big
stakes
for
that
kind
of
lad
dabble
in
crime
for
now
for
the
layout
got
three
men
shut
up
in
dalquharter
house
who
by
this
time
have
probably
escaped
one
of
you
what
his
name
heritage
is
in
the
old
tower
and
you
think
that
think
the
princess
is
still
there
and
will
sit
round
the
place
like
terriers
sometime
the
danish
brig
will
arrive
with
reinforcements
and
then
there
will
be
a
hefty
fight
well
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
get
rid
of
loudon
stymie
with
the
authorities
princess
i
going
to
carry
you
off
in
my
car
to
the
chief
constable
the
second
thing
is
for
you
after
that
to
stay
on
here
it
a
deadly
place
on
a
wet
day
but
it
safe
enough
saskia
shook
her
head
and
dickson
spoke
for
her
you
no
get
her
to
stop
here
i
done
my
best
but
determined
to
be
back
at
dalquharter
you
see
she
expecting
a
friend
and
besides
if
there
going
to
be
a
battle
she
like
to
be
in
it
is
that
so
mem
sir
archie
looked
helplessly
around
him
and
the
sight
of
the
face
convinced
him
that
argument
would
be
fruitless
anyhow
she
must
come
with
me
to
the
chief
constable
lethington
a
slow
bird
on
the
wing
and
i
do
see
myself
convincin
him
that
he
must
get
busy
unless
i
can
produce
the
princess
even
then
it
may
be
a
tough
job
for
sunday
and
in
these
parts
people
go
to
sleep
till
monday
mornin
that
just
what
i
trying
to
get
at
said
dickson
by
all
means
go
to
the
chief
constable
and
tell
him
it
life
or
death
my
lawyer
in
glasgow
caw
will
have
been
stirring
him
up
yesterday
and
you
two
should
complete
the
job
but
what
i
feared
is
that
he
not
be
in
time
as
you
say
it
the
sabbath
day
and
the
police
are
terrible
slow
now
any
moment
that
brig
may
be
here
and
the
trouble
will
start
i
wanting
to
save
the
princess
but
i
wanting
too
to
give
these
blagyirds
the
roughest
handling
they
ever
got
in
their
lives
therefore
i
say
there
no
time
to
lose
we
far
ower
few
to
put
up
a
fight
and
we
want
every
man
you
got
about
this
place
to
hold
the
fort
till
the
police
come
sir
archibald
looked
upon
the
earnest
flushed
face
of
dickson
with
admiration
i
blessed
if
you
not
the
most
brigand
i
ever
struck
i
not
i
just
a
business
man
do
you
realise
that
you
levying
a
private
war
and
breaking
every
law
of
the
land
hoots
said
dickson
i
do
care
a
docken
about
the
law
i
for
seeing
this
job
through
what
force
can
you
produce
only
cripples
i
afraid
there
sime
my
butler
he
was
a
fusilier
jock
and
as
you
saw
has
lost
an
arm
then
mcguffog
the
keeper
is
a
good
man
but
he
still
got
a
turkish
bullet
in
his
thigh
the
chauffeur
carfrae
was
in
the
yeomanry
and
lost
half
a
foot
and
there
myself
as
lame
as
a
duck
the
herds
on
the
home
farm
are
no
good
for
one
seventy
and
the
other
is
in
bed
with
jaundice
the
mains
can
produce
four
men
but
they
rather
a
job
lot
they
do
fine
said
dickson
heartily
all
sodgers
and
no
doubt
all
good
shots
have
you
plenty
guns
sir
archie
burst
into
uproarious
laughter
mccunn
you
a
man
after
my
own
heart
i
under
your
orders
if
i
had
a
boy
i
put
him
into
the
provision
trade
for
it
the
place
to
see
fightin
yes
no
end
of
guns
i
advise
for
they
more
stoppin
power
in
a
rush
than
a
rifle
and
i
take
it
it
a
we
for
right
said
dickson
i
saw
a
bicycle
in
the
hall
i
want
you
to
lend
it
me
for
i
must
be
getting
back
you
take
the
princess
and
do
the
best
you
can
with
the
chief
constable
and
then
then
you
load
up
your
car
with
your
folk
and
come
down
the
hill
to
dalquharter
there
be
a
laddie
or
maybe
more
than
one
waiting
for
you
on
this
side
the
village
to
give
you
instructions
take
your
orders
from
them
if
it
a
ruffian
called
dougal
you
be
wise
to
heed
what
he
says
for
he
has
a
grand
head
for
battles
five
minutes
later
dickson
was
pursuing
a
quavering
course
like
a
snipe
down
the
avenue
he
was
a
miserable
performer
on
a
bicycle
not
for
twenty
years
had
he
bestridden
one
and
he
did
not
understand
such
new
devices
as
and
change
of
gears
the
mounting
had
been
the
worst
part
and
it
had
only
been
achieved
by
the
help
of
a
rockery
he
had
begun
by
cutting
into
two
and
missing
a
birch
tree
by
inches
but
he
clung
on
desperately
well
knowing
that
if
he
fell
off
it
would
be
hard
to
remount
and
at
length
he
gained
the
avenue
when
he
passed
the
lodge
gates
he
was
riding
fairly
straight
and
when
he
turned
off
the
ayr
highway
to
the
side
road
that
led
to
dalquharter
he
was
more
or
less
master
of
his
machine
he
crossed
the
garple
by
an
ancient
bridge
observing
even
in
his
absorption
with
the
that
the
stream
was
in
roaring
spate
he
wrestled
up
the
further
hill
with
aching
and
got
to
the
top
just
before
his
strength
gave
out
then
as
the
road
turned
seaward
he
had
the
slope
with
him
and
enjoyed
some
respite
it
was
no
case
for
putting
up
his
feet
for
the
gale
was
blowing
hard
on
his
right
cheek
but
the
downward
grade
enabled
him
to
keep
his
course
with
little
exertion
his
anxiety
to
get
back
to
the
scene
of
action
was
for
the
moment
appeased
since
he
knew
he
was
making
as
good
speed
as
the
weather
allowed
so
he
had
leisure
for
thought
but
the
mind
of
this
preposterous
being
was
not
on
the
business
before
him
he
dallied
with
irrelevant
things
with
the
problems
of
youth
and
love
he
was
beginning
to
be
very
nervous
about
heritage
not
as
the
solitary
garrison
of
the
old
tower
but
as
the
lover
of
saskia
that
everybody
should
be
in
love
with
her
appeared
to
him
only
proper
for
he
had
never
met
her
like
and
assumed
that
it
did
not
exist
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
seemed
to
him
a
reasonable
thing
since
hopeless
loyalty
and
unrequited
passion
were
the
eternal
of
romance
he
wished
he
were
himself
to
have
the
chance
of
indulging
in
such
sentimentality
for
such
a
lady
but
heritage
was
not
like
him
and
would
never
be
content
with
a
romantic
folly
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
for
two
years
a
long
time
he
spoke
about
wanting
to
die
for
her
which
was
a
flight
beyond
dickson
himself
i
doubt
it
will
be
what
they
call
a
passion
he
reflected
with
reverence
but
it
was
hopeless
he
saw
quite
clearly
that
it
was
hopeless
why
he
could
not
have
explained
for
dickson
instincts
were
subtler
than
his
intelligence
he
recognised
that
the
two
belonged
to
different
circles
of
being
which
nowhere
intersected
that
mysterious
lady
whose
eyes
had
looked
through
life
to
the
other
side
was
no
mate
for
the
poet
his
faithful
soul
was
agitated
for
he
had
developed
for
heritage
a
sincere
affection
it
would
break
his
heart
poor
man
there
was
he
holding
the
fort
alone
and
cheering
himself
with
delightful
fancies
about
one
remoter
than
the
moon
dickson
wanted
happy
endings
and
here
there
was
no
hope
of
such
he
hated
to
admit
that
life
could
be
crooked
but
the
optimist
in
him
was
now
fairly
dashed
sir
archie
might
be
the
fortunate
man
for
of
course
he
would
soon
be
in
love
with
her
if
he
were
not
so
already
dickson
like
all
his
class
had
a
profound
regard
for
the
country
gentry
the
business
scot
does
not
usually
revere
wealth
though
he
may
pursue
it
earnestly
nor
does
he
specially
admire
rank
in
the
common
sense
but
for
ancient
race
he
has
respect
in
his
bones
though
it
may
happen
that
in
public
he
denies
it
and
the
laird
has
for
him
a
secular
association
with
good
family
sir
archie
might
do
he
was
young
obviously
gallant
but
no
he
was
not
quite
right
either
just
a
trifle
too
light
in
weight
too
boyish
and
callow
the
princess
must
have
youth
but
it
should
be
mighty
youth
the
youth
of
a
napoleon
or
a
c√¶sar
he
reflected
that
the
great
montrose
for
whom
he
had
a
special
veneration
might
have
filled
the
bill
or
young
harry
with
his
beaver
up
or
claverhouse
in
the
picture
with
the
flush
of
temper
on
his
cheek
the
meditations
of
the
dickson
came
to
an
abrupt
end
he
had
been
riding
negligently
his
head
bent
against
the
wind
and
his
eyes
vaguely
fixed
on
the
wet
of
the
road
of
his
immediate
environs
he
was
pretty
well
unconscious
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
figures
on
each
side
of
him
who
advanced
menacingly
stung
to
activity
he
attempted
to
increase
his
pace
which
was
already
good
for
the
road
at
this
point
descended
steeply
then
before
he
could
prevent
it
a
stick
was
thrust
into
his
front
wheel
and
the
next
second
he
was
describing
a
curve
through
the
air
his
head
took
the
ground
he
felt
a
spasm
of
blinding
pain
and
then
a
sense
of
horrible
suffocation
before
his
wits
left
him
are
ye
sure
it
the
richt
man
ecky
said
a
voice
which
he
did
not
hear

said
the
one
called
ecky
he
be
deid
onyway
long
afore
the
morn
morran
all
forenoon
was
in
a
state
of
disquiet
after
she
had
seen
saskia
and
dickson
start
she
finished
her
housewifely
duties
took
cousin
eug√®nie
her
breakfast
and
made
preparation
for
the
midday
dinner
the
invalid
in
the
bed
in
the
parlour
was
not
a
repaying
subject
cousin
eug√®nie
belonged
to
that
type
of
elderly
women
who
having
been
spoiled
in
youth
find
the
rest
of
life
fall
far
short
of
their
expectations
her
voice
had
acquired
a
perpetual
wail
and
the
corners
of
what
had
once
been
a
pretty
mouth
drooped
in
an
eternal
peevishness
she
found
herself
in
a
morass
of
misery
and
shabby
discomfort
but
had
her
days
continued
in
an
even
tenor
she
would
still
have
lamented
a
dingy
body
was
morran
comment
but
she
laboured
in
kindness
unhappily
they
had
no
common
language
and
it
was
only
by
signs
that
the
hostess
could
discover
her
wants
and
show
her
goodwill
she
fed
her
and
bathed
her
face
saw
to
the
fire
and
left
her
to
sleep
i
boilin
a
hen
to
mak
broth
for
your
denner
mem
try
and
get
a
bit
sleep
now
the
purport
of
the
advice
was
clear
and
cousin
eug√®nie
turned
obediently
on
her
pillow
it
was
morran
custom
of
a
sunday
to
spend
the
morning
in
devout
meditation
some
years
before
she
had
given
up
tramping
the
five
miles
to
kirk
on
the
ground
that
having
been
a
regular
attendant
for
fifty
years
she
had
got
all
the
good
out
of
it
that
was
probable
instead
she
read
slowly
aloud
to
herself
the
sermon
printed
in
a
certain
religious
weekly
which
reached
her
every
saturday
and
concluded
with
a
chapter
or
two
of
the
bible
but
something
had
gone
wrong
with
her
mind
she
could
not
follow
the
thread
of
the
reverend
doctor
discourse
she
could
not
fix
her
attention
on
the
wanderings
and
misdeeds
of
israel
as
recorded
in
the
book
of
exodus
she
must
always
be
getting
up
to
look
at
the
pot
on
the
fire
or
to
open
the
back
door
and
study
the
weather
for
a
little
she
fought
against
her
unrest
and
then
she
gave
up
the
attempt
at
concentration
she
took
the
big
pot
off
the
fire
and
allowed
it
to
simmer
and
presently
she
fetched
her
boots
and
umbrella
and
kilted
her
petticoats
i
be
none
the
waur
o
a
breath
o
caller
air
she
decided
the
wind
was
blowing
great
guns
but
there
was
only
the
thinnest
sprinkle
of
rain
sitting
on
the
roof
and
munching
a
raw
turnip
was
a
figure
which
she
recognised
as
the
smallest
of
the
between
bites
he
was
singing
dolefully
to
the
tune
of
annie
laurie
one
of
the
ditties
of
his
quondam

she
cried
that
cauld
food
for
the
stamach
come
indoors
about
midday
and
i
gie
ye
a
plate
o
broth
the
saluted
and
continued
on
the
turnip
she
took
the
auchenlochan
road
across
the
garple
bridge
for
that
was
the
best
road
to
the
mains
and
by
it
dickson
and
the
others
might
be
returning
her
equanimity
at
all
seasons
was
like
a
turk
and
she
would
not
have
admitted
that
anything
mortal
had
power
to
upset
or
excite
her
nevertheless
it
was
a
heart
that
she
now
bore
beneath
her
sunday
jacket
great
events
she
felt
were
on
the
eve
of
happening
and
of
them
she
was
a
part
dickson
anxiety
was
hers
to
bring
things
to
a
conclusion
the
honour
of
huntingtower
was
at
stake
and
of
the
old
kennedys
she
was
carrying
out
commands
the
dead
boy
who
used
to
clamour
for
her
treacle
scones
and
there
was
more
than
duty
in
it
for
youth
was
not
dead
in
her
old
heart
and
adventure
had
still
power
to
quicken
it
morran
walked
well
with
the
steady
long
paces
of
the
scots
countrywoman
she
left
the
auchenlochan
road
and
took
the
side
path
along
the
tableland
to
the
mains
but
for
the
surge
of
the
gale
and
the
boom
of
the
furious
sea
there
was
little
noise
not
a
bird
cried
in
the
uneasy
air
with
the
wind
behind
her
morran
breasted
the
ascent
till
she
had
on
her
right
the
moorland
running
south
to
the
lochan
valley
and
on
her
left
garple
chafing
in
its
deep
forested
gorges
her
eyes
were
quick
and
she
noted
with
interest
a
weasel
creeping
from
a
cairn
a
little
way
on
she
passed
an
old
ewe
in
difficulties
and
assisted
it
to
rise
but
for
me
my
wumman
hae
been
braxy
ere
nicht
she
told
it
as
it
departed
bleating
then
she
realised
that
she
had
come
a
certain
distance
losh
i
maun
be
back
or
the
hen
will
be
spiled
she
cried
and
was
on
the
verge
of
turning
but
something
caught
her
eye
a
hundred
yards
further
on
the
road
it
was
something
which
moved
with
the
wind
like
a
wounded
bird
fluttering
from
the
roadside
to
a
puddle
and
then
back
to
the
rushes
she
advanced
to
it
missed
it
and
caught
it
it
was
an
old
dingy
green
felt
hat
and
she
recognised
it
as
dickson
morran
brain
after
a
second
of
confusion
worked
fast
and
clearly
she
examined
the
road
and
saw
that
a
little
way
on
the
gravel
had
been
violently
agitated
she
detected
several
prints
of
hobnailed
boots
there
were
prints
too
on
a
patch
of
peat
on
the
south
side
behind
a
tall
bank
of
sods
that
where
they
were
hidin
she
concluded
then
she
explored
on
the
other
side
in
a
thicket
of
hazels
and
wild
raspberries
and
presently
her
perseverance
was
rewarded
the
scrub
was
all
crushed
and
pressed
as
if
several
persons
had
been
forcing
a
passage
in
a
hollow
was
a
gleam
of
something
white
she
moved
towards
it
with
a
quaking
heart
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
it
was
only
a
new
and
expensive
bicycle
with
the
front
wheel
badly
buckled
morran
delayed
no
longer
if
she
had
walked
well
on
her
out
journey
she
beat
all
records
on
the
return
sometimes
she
would
run
till
her
breath
failed
then
she
would
slow
down
till
anxiety
once
more
quickened
her
pace
to
her
joy
on
the
dalquharter
side
of
the
garple
bridge
she
observed
the
figure
of
a
breathless
flushed
with
her
bonnet
awry
and
her
umbrella
held
like
a
scimitar
she
seized
on
the
boy

the

jaikie
did
not
delay
his
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
at
her
news
which
we
know
to
have
been
his
habit
when
morran
after
indulging
in
a
moment
of
barbaric
keening
looked
back
the
road
she
had
come
she
saw
a
small
figure
trotting
up
the
hill
like
a
terrier
who
has
been
left
behind
as
he
trotted
he
wept
bitterly
jaikie
was
getting
dangerous
chapter
xii
how
mccunn
committed
an
assault
upon
an
ally
dickson
always
maintained
that
his
senses
did
not
leave
him
for
more
than
a
second
or
two
but
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
remember
very
clearly
the
events
of
the
next
few
hours
he
was
conscious
of
a
bad
pain
above
his
eyes
and
something
wet
trickling
down
his
cheek
there
was
a
perpetual
sound
of
water
in
his
ears
and
of
men
voices
he
found
himself
dropped
roughly
on
the
ground
and
forced
to
walk
and
was
aware
that
his
legs
were
inclined
to
wobble
somebody
had
a
grip
on
each
arm
so
that
he
could
not
defend
his
face
from
the
brambles
and
that
worried
him
for
his
whole
head
seemed
one
aching
bruise
and
he
dreaded
anything
touching
it
but
all
the
time
he
did
not
open
his
mouth
for
silence
was
the
one
duty
that
his
muddled
wits
enforced
he
felt
that
he
was
not
the
master
of
his
mind
and
he
dreaded
what
he
might
disclose
if
he
began
to
babble
presently
there
came
a
blank
space
of
which
he
had
no
recollection
at
all
the
movement
had
stopped
and
he
was
allowed
to
sprawl
on
the
ground
he
thought
that
his
head
had
got
another
whack
from
a
bough
and
that
the
pain
put
him
into
a
stupor
when
he
awoke
he
was
alone
he
discovered
that
he
was
strapped
very
tightly
to
a
young
scotch
fir
his
arms
were
bent
behind
him
and
his
wrists
tied
together
with
cords
knotted
at
the
back
of
the
tree
his
legs
were
shackled
and
further
cords
fastened
them
to
the
bole
also
there
was
a
halter
round
the
trunk
and
just
under
his
chin
so
that
while
he
breathed
freely
enough
he
could
not
move
his
head
before
him
was
a
tangle
of
bracken
and
scrub
and
beyond
that
the
gloom
of
dense
pines
but
as
he
could
only
see
directly
in
front
his
prospect
was
strictly
circumscribed
very
slowly
he
began
to
take
his
bearings
the
pain
in
his
head
was
now
dulled
and
quite
bearable
and
the
flow
of
blood
had
stopped
for
he
felt
the
incrustation
of
it
beginning
on
his
cheeks
there
was
a
tremendous
noise
all
around
him
and
he
traced
this
to
the
swaying
of
in
the
gale
but
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
deeper
sound
water
surely
water
churning
among
rocks
it
was
a
stream
the
garple
of
course
and
then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
what
had
happened
i
do
not
wish
to
portray
dickson
as
a
hero
for
nothing
would
annoy
him
more
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
his
first
clear
thought
was
not
of
his
own
danger
it
was
intense
exasperation
at
the
miscarriage
of
his
plans
long
ago
he
should
have
been
with
dougal
arranging
operations
giving
him
news
of
sir
archie
finding
out
how
heritage
was
faring
deciding
how
to
use
the
coming
reinforcements
instead
he
was
trussed
up
in
a
wood
a
prisoner
of
the
enemy
and
utterly
useless
to
his
side
he
tugged
at
his
bonds
and
nearly
throttled
himself
but
they
were
of
good
tarry
cord
and
did
not
give
a
fraction
of
an
inch
tears
of
bitter
rage
filled
his
eyes
and
made
furrows
on
his
encrusted
cheeks
idiot
that
he
had
been
he
had
wrecked
everything
what
would
saskia
and
dougal
and
sir
archie
do
without
a
business
man
by
their
side
there
would
be
a
muddle
and
the
little
party
would
walk
into
a
trap
he
saw
it
all
very
clearly
the
men
from
the
sea
would
overpower
them
there
would
be
murder
done
and
an
easy
capture
of
the
princess
and
the
police
would
turn
up
at
long
last
to
find
an
empty
headland
he
had
also
most
comprehensively
wrecked
himself
and
at
the
thought
the
most
genuine
panic
seized
him
there
was
no
earthly
chance
of
escape
for
he
was
tucked
away
in
this
infernal
jungle
till
such
time
as
his
enemies
had
time
to
deal
with
him
as
to
what
that
dealing
would
be
like
he
had
no
doubts
for
they
knew
that
he
had
been
their
chief
opponent
those
desperate
ruffians
would
not
scruple
to
put
an
end
to
him
his
mind
dwelt
with
horrible
fascination
upon
no
doubt
because
of
the
presence
of
the
cord
below
his
chin
he
had
heard
it
was
not
a
painful
death
at
any
rate
he
remembered
a
clerk
he
had
once
had
a
feeble
timid
creature
who
had
twice
attempted
suicide
that
way
surely
it
could
not
be
very
bad
and
it
would
soon
be
over
but
another
thought
came
to
him
they
would
carry
him
off
in
the
ship
and
settle
with
him
at
their
leisure
no
swift
merciful
death
for
him
he
had
read
dreadful
tales
of
the
bolsheviks
skill
in
torture
and
now
they
all
came
back
to
him
stories
of
chinese
mercenaries
and
men
buried
alive
and
death
by
agonising
inches
he
felt
suddenly
very
cold
and
sick
and
hung
in
his
bonds
for
he
had
no
strength
in
his
limbs
then
the
pressure
on
his
throat
braced
him
and
also
quickened
his
numb
mind
the
liveliest
terror
ran
like
quicksilver
through
his
veins
he
endured
some
moments
of
this
anguish
till
after
many
despairing
clutches
at
his
wits
he
managed
to
attain
a
measure
of
he
certainly
was
going
to
allow
himself
to
become
mad
death
was
death
whatever
form
it
took
and
he
had
to
face
death
as
many
better
men
had
done
before
him
he
had
often
thought
about
it
and
wondered
how
he
should
behave
if
the
thing
came
to
him
respectably
he
had
hoped
heroically
he
had
sworn
in
his
moments
of
confidence
but
he
had
never
for
an
instant
dreamed
of
this
cold
lonely
dreadful
business
last
sunday
he
remembered
he
had
been
basking
in
the
afternoon
sun
in
his
little
garden
and
reading
about
the
end
of
fergus
macivor
in
and
thrilling
to
the
romance
of
it
and
then
tibby
had
come
out
and
summoned
him
in
to
tea
then
he
had
rather
wanted
to
be
a
jacobite
in
the
and
in
peril
of
his
neck
and
now
providence
had
taken
him
most
terribly
at
his
word
a
week
ago
he
groaned
at
the
remembrance
of
that
sunny
garden
in
seven
days
he
had
found
a
new
world
and
tried
a
new
life
and
had
come
now
to
the
end
of
it
he
did
not
want
to
die
less
now
than
ever
with
such
wide
horizons
opening
before
him
but
that
was
the
worst
of
it
he
reflected
for
to
have
a
great
life
great
hazards
must
be
taken
and
there
was
always
the
risk
of
this
sudden
extinguisher
had
he
to
choose
again
far
better
the
smooth
sheltered
bypath
than
this
accursed
romantic
highway
on
to
which
he
had
blundered
no
by
heaven
no
confound
it
if
he
had
to
choose
he
would
do
it
all
again
something
stiff
and
indomitable
in
his
soul
was
bracing
him
to
a
manlier
humour
there
was
no
one
to
see
the
figure
strapped
to
the
fir
but
had
there
been
a
witness
he
would
have
noted
that
at
this
stage
dickson
shut
his
teeth
and
that
his
troubled
eyes
looked
very
steadily
before
him
his
business
he
felt
was
to
keep
from
thinking
for
if
he
thought
at
all
there
would
be
a
flow
of
memories
of
his
wife
his
home
his
books
his
friends
to
unman
him
so
he
steeled
himself
to
blankness
like
a
sleepless
man
imagining
white
sheep
in
a
gate
he
noted
a
robin
below
the
hazels
strutting
impudently
and
there
was
a
tit
on
a
bracken
frond
which
made
the
thing
sway
like
one
of
the
he
used
to
play
with
as
a
boy
there
was
no
wind
in
that
undergrowth
and
any
movement
must
be
due
to
bird
or
beast
the
tit
flew
off
and
the
oscillations
of
the
bracken
slowly
died
away
then
they
began
again
but
more
violently
and
dickson
could
not
see
the
bird
that
caused
them
it
must
be
something
down
at
the
roots
of
the
covert
a
rabbit
perhaps
or
a
fox
or
a
weasel
he
watched
for
the
first
sign
of
the
beast
and
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
tawny
fur
yes
there
it
was
pale
dirty
yellow
a
weasel
clearly
then
suddenly
the
patch
grew
larger
and
to
his
amazement
he
looked
at
a
human
face
the
face
of
a
pallid
small
boy
a
head
disentangled
itself
followed
by
thin
shoulders
and
then
by
a
pair
of
very
dirty
bare
legs
the
figure
raised
itself
and
looked
sharply
round
to
make
certain
that
the
coast
was
clear
then
it
stood
up
and
saluted
revealing
the
lineaments
of
wee
jaikie
at
the
sight
dickson
knew
that
he
was
safe
by
that
certainty
of
instinct
which
is
independent
of
proof
like
the
man
who
prays
for
a
sign
and
has
his
prayer
answered
he
observed
that
the
boy
was
quietly
sobbing
jaikie
surveyed
the
position
for
an
instant
with
eyes
and
then
unclasped
a
knife
feeling
the
edge
of
the
blade
on
his
thumb
he
darted
behind
the
fir
and
a
second
later
dickson
wrists
were
free
then
he
sawed
at
the
legs
and
cut
the
shackles
which
tied
them
together
and
then
most
circumspectly
assaulted
the
cord
which
bound
dickson
neck
to
the
trunk
there
now
remained
only
the
two
bonds
which
fastened
the
legs
and
the
body
to
the
tree
there
was
a
sound
in
the
wood
different
from
the
wind
and
stream
jaikie
listened
like
a
startled
hind
they
comin
back
he
gasped
just
you
bide
where
ye
are
and
let
on
ye
still
tied
up
he
disappeared
in
the
scrub
as
inconspicuously
as
a
rat
while
two
of
the
tinklers
came
up
the
slope
from
the
waterside
dickson
in
a
fever
of
impatience
cursed
wee
jaikie
for
not
cutting
his
remaining
bonds
so
that
he
could
at
least
have
made
a
dash
for
freedom
and
then
he
realised
that
the
boy
had
been
right
feeble
and
cramped
as
he
was
he
would
have
stood
no
chance
in
a
race
one
of
the
tinklers
was
the
man
called
ecky
he
had
been
running
hard
and
was
mopping
his
brow
hob
seen
the
brig
he
said
it

and

meet
the
boats
at
the
garplefit
the
other
cast
a
glance
towards
dickson
what
about
him
he
asked
the
two
scrutinised
their
prisoner
from
a
distance
of
a
few
paces
dickson
well
aware
of
his
peril
held
himself
as
stiff
as
if
every
bond
had
been
in
place
the
thought
flashed
on
him
that
if
he
were
too
immobile
they
might
think
he
was
dying
or
dead
and
come
close
to
examine
him
if
they
only
kept
their
distance
the
dusk
of
the
wood
would
prevent
them
detecting
jaikie
handiwork
what
you
take
to
let
me
go
he
asked
plaintively
naething

you
could
offer

and
ye

some
queer
things
ere
nicht
davie
the
two
set
off
at
a
good
pace
down
the
stream
while
dickson
pulsing
heart
returned
to
its
normal
rhythm
as
the
sound
of
their
feet
died
away
wee
jaikie
crawled
out
from
cover
now
and
very
he
slit
the
last
thongs
and
dickson
fell
limply
on
his
face
losh
laddie
i
awful
stiff
he
groaned
now
listen
away
all
your
pith
to
dougal
and
tell
him
that
the
brig
in
and
the
men
will
be
landing
inside
the
hour
tell
him
i
coming
as
fast
as
my
legs
will
let
me
the
princess
will
likely
be
there
already
and
sir
archibald
and
his
men
but
if
they
no
tell
dougal
they
coming
haste
you
jaikie
and
see
here
i
never
forget
what
you
done
for
me
the
day
a
fine
wee
laddie
the
obedient
disappeared
and
dickson
painfully
and
laboriously
set
himself
to
climb
the
slope
he
decided
that
his
quickest
and
safest
route
lay
by
the
highroad
and
he
had
also
some
hopes
of
recovering
his
bicycle
on
examining
his
body
he
seemed
to
have
sustained
no
very
great
damage
except
a
painful
cramping
of
legs
and
arms
and
a
certain
dizziness
in
the
head
his
pockets
had
been
thoroughly
rifled
and
he
reflected
with
amusement
that
he
the
mccunn
did
not
possess
at
the
moment
a
single
copper
but
his
spirits
were
soaring
for
somehow
his
escape
had
given
him
an
assurance
of
ultimate
success
providence
had
directly
interfered
on
his
behalf
by
the
hand
of
wee
jaikie
and
that
surely
meant
that
it
would
see
him
through
but
his
chief
emotion
was
an
ardour
of
impatience
to
get
to
the
scene
of
action
he
must
be
at
dalquharter
before
the
men
from
the
sea
he
must
find
dougal
and
discover
his
dispositions
heritage
would
be
on
guard
in
the
tower
and
in
a
very
little
the
enemy
would
be
round
it
it
would
be
just
like
the
princess
to
try
and
enter
there
but
at
all
costs
that
must
be
hindered
she
and
sir
archie
must
not
be
cornered
in
stone
walls
but
must
keep
their
communications
open
and
fall
on
the
enemy
flank
oh
if
the
police
would
only
come
in
time
what
a
of
miscreants
that
day
would
see
as
the
trees
thinned
on
the
brow
of
the
slope
and
he
saw
the
sky
he
realised
that
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
it
must
be
well
on
for
five
the
wind
still
blew
furiously
and
the
oaks
on
the
fringes
of
the
wood
were
whipped
like
saplings
ruefully
he
admitted
that
the
gale
would
not
defeat
the
enemy
if
the
brig
found
a
sheltered
anchorage
on
the
south
side
of
the
headland
beyond
the
garple
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
boats
to
make
the
garple
mouth
though
it
might
be
a
difficult
job
to
get
out
again
the
thought
quickened
his
steps
and
he
came
out
of
cover
on
to
the
public
road
without
a
prior
reconnaissance
just
in
front
of
him
stood
a
something
had
gone
wrong
with
it
for
its
owner
was
tinkering
at
it
on
the
side
farthest
from
dickson
a
wild
hope
seized
him
that
this
might
be
the
vanguard
of
the
police
and
he
went
boldly
towards
it
the
owner
who
was
kneeling
raised
his
face
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
dickson
looked
into
his
eyes
he
recognised
them
only
too
well
they
belonged
to
the
man
he
had
seen
in
the
inn
at
kirkmichael
the
man
whom
heritage
had
decided
was
an
australian
but
whom
they
now
knew
to
be
their
the
man
called
paul
who
had
persecuted
the
princess
for
years
and
whom
alone
of
all
beings
on
earth
she
feared
he
had
been
expected
before
but
had
arrived
now
in
the
nick
of
time
while
the
brig
was
casting
anchor
saskia
had
said
that
he
had
a
devil
brain
and
dickson
as
he
stared
at
him
saw
a
fiendish
cleverness
in
his
straight
brows
and
a
remorseless
cruelty
in
his
stiff
jaw
and
his
pale
eyes
he
achieved
the
bravest
act
of
his
life
shaky
and
dizzy
as
he
was
with
freedom
newly
opened
to
him
and
the
mental
torments
of
his
captivity
still
an
awful
recollection
he
did
not
hesitate
he
saw
before
him
the
villain
of
the
drama
the
one
man
that
stood
between
the
princess
and
peace
of
mind
he
regarded
no
consequences
gave
no
heed
to
his
own
fate
and
thought
only
how
to
put
his
enemy
out
of
action
there
was
a
big
spanner
lying
on
the
ground
he
seized
it
and
with
all
his
strength
smote
at
the
man
face
the
kneeling
and
working
hard
at
his
machine
had
raised
his
head
at
dickson
approach
and
beheld
a
wild
apparition
a
short
man
in
ragged
tweeds
with
a
bloody
brow
and
long
smears
of
blood
on
his
cheeks
the
next
second
he
observed
the
threat
of
attack
and
ducked
his
head
so
that
the
spanner
only
grazed
his
scalp
the
toppled
over
its
owner
sprang
to
his
feet
and
found
the
short
man
very
pale
and
gasping
about
to
renew
the
assault
in
such
a
crisis
there
was
no
time
for
inquiry
and
the
cyclist
was
well
trained
in
he
leaped
the
prostrate
bicycle
and
before
his
assailant
could
get
in
a
blow
brought
his
left
fist
into
violent
contact
with
his
chin
dickson
tottered
back
a
step
or
two
and
then
subsided
among
the
bracken
he
did
not
lose
his
senses
but
he
had
no
more
strength
in
him
he
felt
horribly
ill
and
struggled
in
vain
to
get
up
the
cyclist
a
gigantic
figure
towered
above
him
who
the
devil
are
you
he
was
asking
what
do
you
mean
by
it
dickson
had
no
breath
for
words
and
knew
that
if
he
tried
to
speak
he
would
be
very
sick
he
could
only
stare
up
like
a
dog
at
the
angry
eyes
angry
beyond
question
they
were
but
surely
not
malevolent
indeed
as
they
looked
at
the
shameful
figure
on
the
ground
amusement
filled
them
the
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
who
on
earth
are
you
the
voice
repeated
and
then
into
it
came
recognition
i
seen
you
before
i
believe
you
the
little
man
i
saw
last
week
at
the
black
bull
be
so
good
as
to
explain
why
you
want
to
murder
me
explanation
was
beyond
dickson
but
his
conviction
was
being
wofully
shaken
saskia
had
said
her
enemy
was
as
beautiful
as
a
devil
he
remembered
the
phrase
for
he
had
thought
it
ridiculous
this
man
was
magnificent
but
there
was
nothing
devilish
in
his
lean
grave
face
what
your
name
the
voice
was
asking
tell
me
yours
first
dickson
essayed
to
stutter
between
spasms
of
nausea
my
name
is
alexander
nicholson
was
the
answer
then
you
no
the
man
it
was
a
cry
of
wrath
and
despair
you
a
very
desperate
little
chap
for
whom
had
i
the
honour
to
be
mistaken
dickson
had
now
wriggled
into
a
sitting
position
and
had
clasped
his
hands
above
his
aching
head
i
thought
you
were
a
russian
name
of
paul
he
groaned
paul
paul
who
just
paul
a
bolshevik
and
an
awful
bad
lot
dickson
could
not
see
the
change
which
his
words
wrought
in
the
face
he
found
himself
picked
up
in
strong
arms
and
carried
to
a
where
his
battered
face
was
carefully
washed
his
throbbing
brows
laved
and
a
wet
handkerchief
bound
over
them
then
he
was
given
brandy
in
the
socket
of
a
flask
which
eased
his
nausea
the
cyclist
ran
his
bicycle
to
the
roadside
and
found
a
seat
for
dickson
behind
the
of
the
old
bucht
now
you
are
going
to
tell
me
everything
he
said
if
the
paul
who
is
your
enemy
is
the
paul
i
think
him
then
we
are
allies
but
dickson
did
not
need
this
assurance
his
mind
had
suddenly
received
a
revelation
the
princess
had
expected
an
enemy
but
also
a
friend
might
not
this
be
the
friend
for
whose
sake
she
was
rooted
to
huntingtower
with
all
its
terrors
are
you
sure
you
name
no
alexis
he
asked
in
my
own
country
i
was
called
alexis
nicolaevitch
for
i
am
a
russian
but
for
some
years
i
have
made
my
home
with
your
folk
and
i
call
myself
alexander
nicholson
which
is
the
english
form
who
told
you
about
alexis
give
me
your
hand
said
dickson
shamefacedly
man
she
been
looking
for
you
for
weeks
you
terribly
behind
the
fair
she
he
cried
for
god
sake
tell
me
all
you
know
ay
she
the
princess
but
what
are
we
havering
here
for
i
tell
you
at
this
moment
she
somewhere
down
about
the
old
tower
and
boatloads
of
blagyirds
landing
from
the
sea
help
me
up
man
for
i
must
be
off
the
story
will
keep
losh
it
very
near
the
darkening
if
you
alexis
you
just
about
in
time
for
a
battle
but
dickson
on
his
feet
was
but
a
frail
creature
he
was
still
deplorably
giddy
and
his
legs
showed
an
unpleasing
tendency
to
crumple
i
fair
done
he
moaned
you
see
i
been
tied
up
all
day
to
a
tree
and
had
two
sore
bashes
on

and

about

village

and
never

we

together
said
the
other
quietly
you
can
sit
behind
me
and
hang
on
to
my
waist
before
you
turned
up
i
had
pretty
well
got
the
thing
in
order
dickson
in
a
fever
of
impatience
sat
by
while
the
russian
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
machine
and
as
well
as
his
anxiety
allowed
put
him
in
possession
of
the
main
facts
of
the
story
he
told
of
how
he
and
heritage
had
come
to
dalquharter
of
the
first
meeting
with
saskia
of
the
trip
to
glasgow
with
the
jewels
of
the
exposure
of
loudon
the
factor
of
last
night
doings
in
the
house
and
of
the
journey
that
morning
to
the
mains
of
garple
he
sketched
the
figures
on
the
scene
heritage
and
sir
archie
dobson
and
his
gang
the
gorbals
he
told
of
the
enemy
plans
so
far
as
he
knew
them
looked
at
from
a
business
point
of
view
he
said
the
like
this
there
heritage
in
the
tower
with
dobson
l√©on
and
spidel
sitting
round
him
somewhere
about
the
place
there
the
princess
and
sir
archibald
and
three
men
with
guns
from
the
mains
dougal
and
his
five
laddies
are
running
loose
in
the
policies
and
there
four
tinklers
and
god
knows
how
many
foreign
ruffians
pushing
up
from
the
garplefoot
and
a
brig
lying
waiting
to
carry
off
the
ladies
likewise
there
the
police
somewhere
on
the
road
though
the
dear
kens
when
they
turn
up
it
awful
the
incompetence
of
our
government
and
the
rates
and
taxes
that
high
and
there
you
and
me
by
this
roadside
and
i
no
more
use
than
a
that
the
situation
and
the
question
is
what
our
plan
to
be
we
must
keep
the
blagyirds
in
play
till
the
police
come
and
at
the
same
time
we
must
keep
the
princess
out
of
danger
that
why
i
wanting
back
for
they
sore
need
of
a
business
head
yon
sir
archibald
a
fine
fellow
but
i
doubt
he
be
a
bit
rash
and
the
princess
is
no
to
hold
or
bind
our
first
job
is
to
find
dougal
and
get
a
grip
of
the
facts
i
am
going
to
the
princess
said
the
russian
ay
that
be
best
you
be
maybe
able
to
manage
her
for
you
be
well
acquaint
she
is
my
kinswoman
she
is
also
my
affianced
wife
keep
us
dickson
exclaimed
with
a
doleful
thought
of
heritage
what
ailed
you
then
no
to
look
after
her
better
we
have
been
long
separated
because
it
was
her
will
she
had
work
to
do
and
disappeared
from
me
though
i
searched
all
europe
for
her
then
she
sent
me
word
when
the
danger
became
extreme
and
summoned
me
to
her
aid
but
she
gave
me
poor
directions
for
she
did
not
know
her
own
plans
very
clearly
she
spoke
of
a
place
called
darkwater
and
i
have
been
hunting
half
scotland
for
it
it
was
only
last
night
that
i
heard
of
dalquharter
and
guessed
that
that
might
be
the
name
but
i
was
far
down
in
galloway
and
have
ridden
fifty
miles
it
a
queer
thing
but
i
would
take
you
for
a
russian
alexis
finished
his
work
and
put
away
his
tools
for
the
present
he
said
i
am
an
englishman
till
my
country
comes
again
to
her
senses
ten
years
ago
i
left
russia
for
i
was
sick
of
the
foolishness
of
my
class
and
wanted
a
free
life
in
a
new
world
i
went
to
australia
and
made
good
as
an
engineer
i
am
a
partner
in
a
firm
which
is
pretty
well
known
even
in
britain
when
war
broke
out
i
returned
to
fight
for
my
people
and
when
russia
fell
out
of
the
war
i
joined
the
australians
in
france
and
fought
with
them
till
the
armistice
and
now
i
have
only
one
duty
left
to
save
the
princess
and
take
her
with
me
to
my
new
home
till
russia
is
a
nation
once
more
dickson
whistled
joyfully
so
heritage
was
right
he
aye
said
you
were
an
australian
and
you
a
business
man
that
grand
hearing
and
puts
my
mind
at
rest
you
must
take
charge
of
the
party
at
the
house
for
sir
archibald
a
daft
young
lad
and
heritage
is
a
poet
i
thought
i
would
have
to
go
myself
but
i
doubt
i
would
just
be
a
hindrance
with
my
dwaibly
legs
i
be
better
outside
watching
for
the
police
are
you
ready
sir
dickson
not
without
difficulty
perched
himself
astride
the
luggage
carrier
firmly
grasping
the
rider
round
the
middle
the
machine
started
but
it
was
evidently
in
a
bad
way
for
it
made
poor
going
till
the
descent
towards
the
main
auchenlochan
road
on
the
slope
it
warmed
up
and
they
crossed
the
garple
bridge
at
a
fair
pace
there
was
to
be
no
pleasant
april
twilight
for
the
stormy
sky
had
already
made
dusk
and
in
a
very
little
the
dark
would
fall
so
sombre
was
the
evening
that
dickson
did
not
notice
a
figure
in
the
shadow
of
the
roadside
pines
till
it
whistled
shrilly
on
its
fingers
he
cried
on
alexis
to
stop
and
this
being
accomplished
with
some
suddenness
fell
off
at
dougal
feet
what
the
news
he
demanded
dougal
glanced
at
alexis
and
seemed
to
approve
his
looks
napoleon
has
just
reported
that
three
boatloads

either

were

the
man

terrible

and
slow

convertit
him
but
he
threepit
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
collect
his

and
that
there
was
no
danger
o
the
brig
landin
afore

he
wrong
there
onyway
for
they
landit
dougal
said
dickson

nick
of
time

there
no
other
way
i
must
be
in
the
hoose
mysel
thomas
yownie
headquarters
is
the
auld
wife
at
that
moment
in
a
pause
of
the
gale
came
the
echo
of
a
shot
pistol
said
alexis
heritage
said
dougal
trade
will
be
gettin
brisk
with
him
start
your
machine
and
i
hang
on
ahint
we
try
the
road
by
the
west
lodge
presently
the
pair
disappeared
in
the
dusk
the
noise
of
the
engine
was
swallowed
up
in
the
wild
orchestra
of
the
wind
and
dickson
hobbled
towards
the
village
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
made
him
oblivious
of
his
wounds
that
lonely
pistol
shot
was
he
felt
the
bell
to
ring
up
the
curtain
on
the
last
act
of
the
play
chapter
xiii
the
coming
of
the
danish
brig
john
heritage
solitary
in
the
old
tower
found
much
to
occupy
his
mind
his
giddiness
was
passing
though
the
dregs
of
a
headache
remained
and
his
spirits
rose
with
his
responsibilities
at
daybreak
he
breakfasted
out
of
the
mearns
street
provision
box
and
made
tea
in
one
of
the
camp
kettles
next
he
gave
some
attention
to
his
toilet
necessary
after
the
of
the
night
he
made
shift
to
bathe
in
icy
water
from
the
tower
well
shaved
tidied
up
his
clothes
and
found
a
clean
shirt
from
his
pack
he
carefully
brushed
his
hair
reminding
himself
that
thus
had
the
spartans
done
before
thermopyl√¶
the
neat
and
somewhat
pallid
young
man
that
emerged
from
these
rites
then
ascended
to
the
first
floor
to
reconnoitre
the
landscape
from
the
narrow
unglazed
windows
if
any
one
had
told
him
a
week
ago
that
he
would
be
in
so
strange
a
world
he
would
have
quarrelled
violently
with
his
informant
a
week
ago
he
was
a
cynical
modern
a
contemner
of
illusions
a
swallower
of
formulas
a
breaker
of
shams
one
who
had
seen
through
the
heroical
and
found
it
silly
romance
and
toys
were
playthings
for
fatted
not
for
strenuous
and
youth
but
the
truth
was
that
now
he
was
altogether
spellbound
by
these
toys
to
think
that
he
was
serving
his
lady
was
rapture
ecstasy
that
for
her
he
was
venturing
all
he
rejoiced
to
be
alone
with
his
private
fancies
his
one
fear
was
that
the
part
he
had
cast
himself
for
should
be
needless
that
the
men
from
the
sea
should
not
come
or
that
reinforcements
would
arrive
before
he
should
be
called
upon
he
hoped
alone
to
make
a
stand
against
thousands
what
the
upshot
might
be
he
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
of
course
the
princess
would
be
saved
but
first
he
must
glut
his
appetite
for
the
heroic
he
made
a
diary
of
events
that
day
just
as
he
used
to
do
at
the
front
at
twenty
minutes
past
eight
he
saw
the
first
figure
coming
from
the
house
it
was
spidel
who
limped
round
the
tower
tried
the
door
and
came
to
a
halt
below
the
window
heritage
stuck
out
his
head
and
wished
him
good
morning
getting
in
reply
an
amazed
stare
the
man
was
not
disposed
to
talk
though
heritage
made
some
interesting
observations
on
the
weather
but
departed
quicker
than
he
came
in
the
direction
of
the
west
lodge
just
before
nine
he
returned
with
dobson
and
l√©on
they
made
a
very
complete
reconnaissance
of
the
tower
and
for
a
moment
heritage
thought
that
they
were
about
to
try
to
force
an
entrance
they
tugged
and
hammered
at
the
great
oak
door
which
he
had
further
strengthened
by
erecting
behind
it
a
pile
of
the
heaviest
lumber
he
could
find
in
the
place
it
was
imperative
that
they
should
not
get
in
and
he
got
dickson
pistol
ready
with
the
firm
intention
of
shooting
them
if
necessary
but
they
did
nothing
except
to
hold
a
conference
in
the
hazel
clump
a
hundred
yards
to
the
north
when
dobson
seemed
to
be
laying
down
the
law
and
l√©on
spoke
rapidly
with
a
great
fluttering
of
hands
they
were
obviously
puzzled
by
the
sight
of
heritage
whom
they
believed
to
have
left
the
neighbourhood
then
dobson
went
off
leaving
l√©on
and
spidel
on
guard
one
at
the
edge
of
the
shrubberies
between
the
tower
and
the
house
the
other
on
the
side
nearest
the
laver
glen
these
were
their
posts
but
they
did
around
the
building
and
passed
so
close
to
heritage
window
that
he
could
have
tossed
a
cigarette
on
their
heads
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
get
busy
with
camouflage
they
must
be
convinced
that
the
princess
was
in
the
place
for
he
wanted
their
whole
mind
to
be
devoted
to
the
siege
he
rummaged
among
the
baggage
and
extracted
a
skirt
and
a
coloured
scarf
the
latter
he
managed
to
flutter
so
that
it
could
be
seen
at
the
window
the
next
time
one
of
the
watchers
came
within
sight
he
also
fixed
up
the
skirt
so
that
the
fringe
of
it
could
be
seen
and
when
l√©on
appeared
below
he
was
in
the
shadow
talking
rapid
french
in
a
very
fair
imitation
of
the
tones
of
cousin
eug√®nie
the
ruse
had
its
effect
for
l√©on
promptly
went
off
to
tell
spidel
and
when
dobson
appeared
he
too
was
given
the
news
this
seemed
to
settle
their
plans
for
all
three
remained
on
guard
dobson
nearest
to
the
tower
seated
on
an
outcrop
of
rock
with
his
mackintosh
collar
turned
up
and
his
eyes
usually
turned
to
the
misty
sea
by
this
time
it
was
eleven
and
the
next
three
hours
passed
slowly
with
heritage
he
fell
to
picturing
the
fortunes
of
his
friends
dickson
and
the
princess
should
by
this
time
be
far
inland
out
of
danger
and
in
the
way
of
finding
succour
he
was
confident
that
they
would
return
but
he
trusted
not
too
soon
for
he
hoped
for
a
run
for
his
money
as
horatius
in
the
gate
after
that
he
was
a
little
torn
in
his
mind
he
wanted
the
princess
to
come
back
and
to
be
somewhere
near
if
there
was
a
fight
going
so
that
she
might
be
a
witness
of
his
devotion
but
she
must
not
herself
run
any
risk
and
he
became
anxious
when
he
remembered
her
terrible
sangfroid
dickson
could
no
more
restrain
her
than
a
child
could
hold
a
greyhound
but
of
course
it
would
never
come
to
that
the
police
would
turn
up
long
before
the
brig
appeared
dougal
had
thought
that
would
not
be
till
high
tide
between
four
and
five
and
the
only
danger
would
be
to
the
pirates
the
three
watchers
would
be
put
in
the
bag
and
the
men
from
the
sea
would
walk
into
a
neat
trap
this
reflection
seemed
to
take
all
the
colour
out
of
heritage
prospect
peril
and
heroism
were
not
to
be
his
lot
only
boredom
a
little
after
twelve
two
of
the
tinklers
appeared
with
some
news
which
made
dobson
laugh
and
pat
them
on
the
shoulder
he
seemed
to
be
giving
them
directions
pointing
seaward
and
southward
he
nodded
to
the
tower
where
heritage
took
the
opportunity
of
again
fluttering
saskia
scarf
athwart
the
window
the
tinklers
departed
at
a
trot
and
dobson
lit
his
pipe
as
if
well
pleased
he
had
some
trouble
with
it
in
the
wind
which
had
risen
to
an
uncanny
violence
even
the
solid
tower
rocked
with
it
and
the
sea
was
a
waste
of
spindrift
and
low
scurrying
cloud
heritage
discovered
a
new
anxiety
this
time
about
the
possibility
of
the
brig
landing
at
all
he
wanted
a
complete
bag
and
it
would
be
tragic
if
they
got
only
the
three
seedy
ruffians
now
circumambulating
his
fortress
about
one
he
was
greatly
cheered
by
the
sight
of
dougal
at
the
moment
dobson
was
lunching
off
a
hunk
of
bread
and
cheese
directly
between
the
tower
and
the
house
just
short
of
the
crest
of
the
ridge
on
the
other
side
of
which
lay
the
stables
and
the
shrubberies
l√©on
was
on
the
north
side
opposite
the
tower
door
and
spidel
was
at
the
south
end
near
the
edge
of
the
garple
glen
heritage
watching
the
ridge
behind
dobson
and
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
which
appeared
over
it
saw
on
the
very
crest
something
like
a
tuft
of
rusty
bracken
which
he
had
not
noticed
before
presently
the
tuft
moved
and
a
hand
shot
up
from
it
waving
a
rag
of
some
sort
dobson
at
the
moment
was
engaged
with
a
bottle
of
porter
and
heritage
could
safely
wave
a
hand
in
reply
he
could
now
make
out
clearly
the
red
head
of
dougal
the
chieftain
having
located
the
three
watchers
proceeded
to
give
an
exhibition
of
his
prowess
for
the
benefit
of
the
lonely
inmate
of
the
tower
using
as
cover
a
drift
of
bracken
he
wormed
his
way
down
till
he
was
not
six
yards
from
dobson
and
heritage
had
the
privilege
of
seeing
his
grinning
countenance
a
very
little
way
above
the
head
then
he
crawled
back
and
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
l√©on
who
was
sitting
on
a
fallen
scotch
fir
at
that
moment
it
occurred
to
the
belgian
to
visit
dobson
heritage
breath
stopped
but
dougal
was
ready
and
froze
into
a
motionless
blur
in
the
shadow
of
a
hazel
bush
then
he
crawled
very
fast
into
the
hollow
where
l√©on
had
been
sitting
seized
something
which
looked
like
a
bottle
and
scrambled
back
to
the
ridge
at
the
top
he
waved
the
object
whatever
it
was
but
heritage
could
not
reply
for
dobson
happened
to
be
looking
towards
the
window
that
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
chieftain
but
presently
he
realised
what
was
the
booty
he
had
annexed
it
must
be
l√©on
which
the
night
before
had
broken
heritage
head
after
that
cheering
episode
boredom
again
set
in
he
collected
some
food
from
the
mearns
street
box
and
indulged
himself
with
a
glass
of
liqueur
brandy
he
was
beginning
to
feel
miserably
cold
so
he
carried
up
some
broken
wood
and
made
a
fire
on
the
immense
hearth
in
the
upper
chamber
anxiety
was
clouding
his
mind
again
for
it
was
now
two
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
reinforcements
which
dickson
and
the
princess
had
gone
to
find
the
minutes
passed
and
soon
it
was
three
and
from
the
window
he
saw
only
the
top
of
the
gaunt
shuttered
house
now
and
then
hidden
by
squalls
of
sleet
and
dobson
squatted
like
an
eskimo
and
trees
dancing
like
a
in
the
gale
all
the
vigour
of
the
morning
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
blood
he
felt
lonely
and
apprehensive
and
puzzled
he
wished
he
had
dickson
beside
him
for
that
little
man
cheerful
voice
and
complacent
triviality
would
be
a
comfort
also
he
was
abominably
cold
he
put
on
his
waterproof
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
fire
it
needed
and
he
hunted
in
his
pockets
for
paper
finding
only
the
slim
volume
lettered
i
set
it
down
as
the
most
significant
commentary
on
his
state
of
mind
he
regarded
the
book
with
intense
disfavour
tore
it
in
two
and
used
a
handful
of
its
fine
leaves
to
get
the
fire
going
they
burned
well
and
presently
the
rest
followed
well
for
dickson
peace
of
mind
that
he
was
not
a
witness
of
such
vandalism
a
little
warmer
but
in
no
way
more
cheerful
he
resumed
his
watch
near
the
window
the
day
was
getting
darker
and
promised
an
early
dusk
his
watch
told
him
that
it
was
after
four
and
still
nothing
had
happened
where
on
earth
were
dickson
and
the
princess
where
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
holy
were
the
police
any
minute
now
the
brig
might
arrive
and
land
its
men
and
he
would
be
left
there
as
a
to
their
wrath
there
must
have
been
an
infernal
muddle
somewhere
anyhow
the
princess
was
out
of
the
trouble
but
where
the
lord
alone
knew
perhaps
the
reinforcements
were
lying
in
wait
for
the
boats
at
the
garplefoot
that
struck
him
as
a
likely
explanation
and
comforted
him
very
soon
he
might
hear
the
sound
of
an
engagement
to
the
south
and
the
next
thing
would
be
dobson
and
his
crew
in
flight
he
was
determined
to
be
in
the
show
somehow
and
would
be
very
close
on
their
heels
he
felt
a
peculiar
dislike
to
all
three
but
especially
to
l√©on
the
small
baby
features
had
for
four
days
set
him
clenching
his
fists
when
he
thought
of
them
the
next
thing
he
saw
was
one
of
the
tinklers
running
hard
towards
the
tower
he
cried
something
to
dobson
which
heritage
could
not
catch
but
which
woke
the
latter
to
activity
the
innkeeper
shouted
to
l√©on
and
spidel
and
the
tinkler
was
excitedly
questioned
dobson
laughed
and
slapped
his
thigh
he
gave
orders
to
the
others
and
himself
joined
the
tinkler
and
hurried
off
in
the
direction
of
the
garplefoot
something
was
happening
there
something
of
ill
omen
for
the
man
face
and
manner
had
been
triumphant
were
the
boats
landing
as
heritage
puzzled
over
this
event
another
figure
appeared
on
the
scene
it
was
a
big
man
in
knickerbockers
and
mackintosh
who
came
round
the
end
of
the
house
from
the
direction
of
the
south
lodge
at
first
he
thought
it
was
the
from
his
own
side
the
help
which
dickson
had
gone
to
find
and
he
only
restrained
himself
in
time
from
shouting
a
welcome
but
surely
their
supports
would
not
advance
so
confidently
in
enemy
country
the
man
strode
over
the
slopes
as
if
looking
for
somebody
then
he
caught
sight
of
l√©on
and
waved
him
to
come
l√©on
must
have
known
him
for
he
hastened
to
obey
the
two
were
about
thirty
yards
from
heritage
window
l√©on
was
telling
some
story
volubly
pointing
now
to
the
tower
and
now
towards
the
sea
the
big
man
nodded
as
if
satisfied
heritage
noted
that
his
right
arm
was
tied
up
and
that
the
mackintosh
sleeve
was
empty
and
that
brought
him
enlightenment
it
was
loudon
the
factor
whom
dickson
had
winged
the
night
before
the
two
of
them
passed
out
of
view
in
the
direction
of
spidel
the
sight
awoke
heritage
to
the
supreme
unpleasantness
of
his
position
he
was
utterly
alone
on
the
headland
and
his
allies
had
vanished
into
space
while
the
enemy
plans
moving
like
were
approaching
their
consummation
for
a
second
he
thought
of
leaving
the
tower
and
hiding
somewhere
in
the
cliffs
he
dismissed
the
notion
unwillingly
for
he
remembered
the
task
that
had
been
set
him
he
was
there
to
hold
the
fort
to
the
last
to
gain
time
though
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
see
what
use
time
was
to
be
when
all
the
strategy
of
his
own
side
seemed
to
have
miscarried
anyhow
the
blackguards
would
be
sold
for
they
would
not
find
the
princess
but
he
felt
a
horrid
void
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
a
looseness
about
his
knees
the
moments
passed
more
quickly
as
he
wrestled
with
his
fears
the
next
he
knew
the
empty
space
below
his
window
was
filling
with
figures
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
them
rough
fellows
with
seamen
coats
still
dripping
as
if
they
had
had
a
wet
landing
dobson
was
with
them
but
for
the
rest
they
were
strange
figures
now
that
the
expected
had
come
at
last
heritage
nerves
grew
calmer
he
made
out
that
the
newcomers
were
trying
the
door
and
he
waited
to
hear
it
fall
for
such
a
mob
could
soon
force
it
but
instead
a
voice
called
from
beneath
will
you
please
open
to
us
it
said
he
stuck
his
head
out
and
saw
a
little
group
with
one
man
at
the
head
of
it
a
young
man
clad
in
oilskins
whose
face
was
dim
in
the
murky
evening
the
voice
was
that
of
a
gentleman
i
have
orders
to
open
to
no
one
heritage
replied
then
i
fear
we
must
force
an
entrance
said
the
voice
you
can
go
to
the
devil
said
heritage
that
defiance
was
the
screw
which
his
nerves
needed
his
temper
had
risen
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
princess
he
did
not
even
remember
his
isolation
his
job
was
to
make
a
fight
for
it
he
ran
up
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
attics
of
the
tower
for
he
recollected
that
there
was
a
window
there
which
looked
over
the
ground
before
the
door
the
place
was
ruinous
the
floor
filled
with
holes
and
a
part
of
the
roof
sagged
down
in
a
corner
the
stones
around
the
window
were
loose
and
crumbling
and
he
managed
to
pull
several
out
so
that
the
slit
was
enlarged
he
found
himself
looking
down
on
a
crowd
of
men
who
had
lifted
the
fallen
tree
on
which
l√©on
had
perched
and
were
about
to
use
it
as
a
battering
ram
the
first
fellow
who
comes
within
six
yards
of
the
door
i
shoot
he
shouted
there
was
a
white
wave
below
as
every
face
was
turned
to
him
he
ducked
back
his
head
in
time
as
a
bullet
chipped
the
side
of
the
window
but
his
position
was
a
good
one
for
he
had
a
hole
in
the
broken
wall
through
which
he
could
see
and
could
shoot
with
his
hand
at
the
edge
of
the
window
while
keeping
his
body
in
cover
the
battering
party
resumed
their
task
and
as
the
tree
swung
nearer
he
fired
at
the
foremost
of
them
he
missed
but
the
shot
for
a
moment
suspended
operations
again
they
came
on
and
again
he
fired
this
time
he
damaged
somebody
for
the
trunk
was
dropped
a
voice
gave
orders
a
sharp
authoritative
voice
the
battering
squad
dissolved
and
there
was
a
general
withdrawal
out
of
the
line
of
fire
from
the
window
was
it
possible
that
he
had
intimidated
them
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
and
then
a
single
figure
came
into
sight
again
holding
something
in
its
hand
he
did
not
fire
for
he
recognised
the
futility
of
his
efforts
the
baseball
swing
of
the
figure
below
could
not
be
mistaken
there
was
a
roar
beneath
and
a
flash
of
fire
as
the
bomb
exploded
on
the
door
then
came
a
rush
of
men
and
the
tower
had
fallen
heritage
clambered
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
gained
the
topmost
parapet
he
had
still
a
pocketful
of
cartridges
and
there
in
a
coign
of
the
old
battlements
he
would
prove
an
ugly
customer
to
the
pursuit
only
one
at
a
time
could
reach
that
siege
perilous
they
would
not
take
long
to
search
the
lower
rooms
and
then
would
be
hot
on
the
trail
of
the
man
who
had
fooled
them
he
had
not
a
scrap
of
fear
left
or
even
of
anger
only
triumph
at
the
thought
of
how
properly
those
ruffians
had
been
sold
like
schoolboys
they
who
unaware
instead
of
two
women
they
had
found
a
man
with
a
gun
and
the
princess
was
miles
off
and
forever
beyond
their
reach
when
they
had
settled
with
him
they
would
no
doubt
burn
the
house
down
but
that
would
serve
them
little
from
his
airy
pinnacle
he
could
see
the
whole
of
huntingtower
a
blur
in
the
dusk
but
for
the
ghostly
eyes
of
its
windows
something
was
coming
from
it
running
lightly
over
the
lawns
lost
for
an
instant
in
the
trees
and
then
appearing
clear
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
where
some
hours
earlier
dougal
had
lain
with
horror
he
saw
that
it
was
a
girl
she
stood
with
the
wind
plucking
at
her
skirts
and
hair
and
she
cried
in
a
high
clear
voice
which
pierced
even
the
confusion
of
the
gale
what
she
cried
he
could
not
tell
for
it
was
in
a
strange
tongue
but
it
reached
the
besiegers
there
was
a
sudden
silence
in
the
din
below
him
and
then
a
confusion
of
shouting
the
men
seemed
to
be
pouring
out
of
the
gap
which
had
been
the
doorway
and
as
he
peered
over
the
parapet
first
one
and
then
another
entered
his
area
of
vision
the
girl
on
the
ridge
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
she
had
attracted
attention
turned
and
ran
back
and
after
her
up
the
slopes
went
the
pursuit
bunched
like
hounds
on
a
good
scent
john
heritage
swearing
terribly
started
to
retrace
his
steps
chapter
xiv
the
second
battle
of
the
cruives
the
military
historian
must
often
make
shift
to
write
of
battles
with
slender
data
but
he
can
pad
out
his
deficiencies
by
learned
parallels
if
his
were
the
talented
pen
describing
this
the
latest
action
fought
on
british
soil
against
a
foreign
foe
he
would
no
doubt
be
crippled
by
the
absence
of
written
orders
and
war
diaries
but
how
eloquently
he
would
discant
on
the
resemblance
between
dougal
and
gouraud
how
the
plan
of
leaving
the
enemy
to
waste
his
strength
upon
a
deserted
position
was
that
which
on
the
of
july
the
french
general
had
used
with
decisive
effect
in
champagne
but
dougal
had
never
heard
of
gouraud
and
i
can
not
claim
that
like
the
happy
warrior
he
through
the
heat
of
conflict
kept
the
law
in
calmness
made
and
saw
what
he
foresaw
i
have
had
the
benefit
of
discussing
the
affair
with
him
and
his
colleagues
but
i
should
offend
against
historic
truth
if
i
represented
the
main
action
as
anything
but
a
scrimmage
a
soldiers
battle
the
historian
would
say
a
malplaquet
an
albuera
just
after
three
that
afternoon
the
was
revealed
in
a
very
bad
temper
he
had
intercepted
sir
archie
car
and
since
l√©on
was
known
to
be
fully
occupied
had
brought
it
in
by
the
west
lodge
and
hidden
it
behind
a
clump
of
laurels
there
he
had
held
a
hoarse
council
of
war
he
had
cast
an
appraising
eye
over
sime
the
butler
carfrae
the
chauffeur
and
mcguffog
the
gamekeeper
and
his
brows
had
lightened
when
he
beheld
sir
archie
with
an
armful
of
guns
and
two
big
but
they
had
darkened
again
at
the
first
words
of
the
leader
of
the
reinforcements
now
for
the
tower
sir
archie
had
observed
cheerfully
we
should
be
a
match
for
the
three
watchers
my
lad
and
it
time
that
poor
devil
was
relieved
a
plan
that
would
be
said
dougal
man
ye
would
be
walkin
into
the
very
trap
they
want
in
an
hour
or
maybe
two
the
rest
will
turn
up
from
the
sea
and
they
have
ye
tight
by
the
neck
na
na
it
time
we
wantin
and
the
longer
they
think
we
a
in
the
auld
tower
the
better
for
us
what
news
o
the
polis
he
listened
to
sir
archie
report
with
a
gloomy
face
not
afore
the
darkenin
they
be
ower
late
the
polis
are
aye
ower
late
it
looks
as
if
we
had
the
job
to
do
oursels
what
notion
god
knows
said
the
baronet
whose
eyes
were
on
saskia
what
yours
the
deference
conciliated
dougal
there
just
the
one
plan
worth
a
docken
there
five
o
us
here
and
there
plenty
weapons
besides
there
five
somewhere
about
and
though
never
tried
it
afore
they
can
be
trusted
to
loose
off
a
gun
my
advice
is
to
hide
at
the
garplefoot
and
stop
the
boats
landin
we
have
the
tinklers
on
our
flank
no
doubt
but
i
not
muckle
feared
o
them
it
would
be
easy
for
the
boats
to
get
in
wi
this
tearin
wind
and
us
firin
volleys
from
the
shore
sir
archie
stared
at
him
with
admiration
you
a
hearty
young
but
great
scott
we
ca
go
pottin
at
strangers
before
we
find
out
their
business
this
is
a
country
and
we
not
entitled
to
start
shootin
except
in
you
can
wash
that
plan
out
for
it
ai
feasible
dougal
spat
cynically
for
all
that
it
the
right
strawtegy
man
we
might
sink
the
lot
and
then
turn
and
settle
wi
dobson
and
all
afore
the
first
polisman
showed
his
neb
it
would
be
a
grand
performance
but
i
was
feared
ye
would
be
for
it
well
there
just
the
one
other
thing
to
do
we
must
get
inside
the
hoose
and
put
it
in
a
state
of
defence
heritage
has
mccunn
pistol
and
he
keep
them
busy
for
a
bit
when
they
finished
wi
him
and
find
the
place
is
empty
try
the
hoose
and
we
give
them
a
warm
reception
that
should
keep
us
goin
till
the
polis
arrive
unless
they
comin
wi
the
blind
carrier
sir
archie
nodded
but
why
put
ourselves
in
their
power
at
all
at
present
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
let
them
bark
up
another
wrong
why
should
the
house
remain
empty
i
take
it
we
here
to
protect
the
princess
well
we
have
done
that
if
they
go
off
dougal
looked
up
to
the
heavens
i
wish
mccunn
was
here
he
sighed
ay
we
got
to
protect
the
princess
and
there
just
the
one
way
to
do
it
and
that
to
put
an
end
to
this
crowd
o
blagyirds
if
they
gang
they
come
again
another
day
either
here
or
somewhere
else
and
it
wo
be
long
afore
they
get
the
lassie
but
if
we
finish
with
them
now
she
can
sit
down
wi
an
easy
mind
that
why
we
got
to
hang
on
to
them
till
the
polis
comes
there
no
way
out
o
this
business
but
a
battle
he
found
an
ally
dougal
is
right
said
saskia
if
i
am
to
have
peace
by
some
way
or
other
the
fangs
of
my
enemies
must
be
drawn
for
ever
he
swung
round
and
addressed
her
formally
mem
i
askin
ye
for
the
last
time
will
ye
keep
out
of
this
business
will
ye
gang
back
and
sit
doun
aside
morran
fire
and
have
your
tea
and
wait
till
we
come
for
ye
ye
can
do
no
good
and
ye
puttin
yourself
terrible
in
the
enemy
power
if
we
beat
and
ye
no
there
they
get
very
little
satisfaction
but
if
they
get
they
get
what
they
come
seekin
i
tell
ye
straight
ye
an
encumbrance
she
laughed
mischievously
i
can
shoot
better
than
you
she
said
he
ignored
the
taunt
will
ye
listen
to
sense
and
fall
to
the
rear
i
will
not
she
said
then
gang
your
own
gait
i
ower
wise
to
wi
women
the
hoose
be
it
it
was
a
journey
which
sorely
tried
dougal
temper
the
only
way
in
was
by
the
verandah
but
the
door
at
the
west
end
had
been
locked
and
the
ladder
had
disappeared
now
of
his
party
three
were
lame
one
lacked
an
arm
and
one
was
a
girl
besides
there
were
the
guns
and
cartridges
to
transport
moreover
at
more
than
one
point
before
the
verandah
was
reached
the
route
was
commanded
by
a
point
on
the
ridge
near
the
old
tower
and
that
had
been
spidel
position
when
dougal
made
his
last
reconnaissance
it
behoved
to
pass
these
points
swiftly
and
unobtrusively
and
his
company
was
neither
swift
nor
unobtrusive
mcguffog
had
a
genius
for
tripping
over
obstacles
and
sir
archie
was
for
ever
proffering
his
aid
to
saskia
who
was
in
a
position
to
give
rather
than
to
receive
being
far
the
most
active
of
the
party
once
dougal
had
to
take
the
gamekeeper
head
and
force
it
down
a
performance
which
would
have
led
to
an
immediate
assault
but
for
sir
archie
presence
nor
did
the
latter
escape
will
ye
stop
heedin
the
lassie
and
attend
to
your
own
job
the
chieftain
growled
makin
as
much
noise
as
a
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
verandah
wall
there
remained
the
problem
of
the
escalade
dougal
clambered
up
like
a
squirrel
by
the
help
of
cracks
in
the
stones
and
he
could
be
heard
trying
the
handle
of
the
door
into
the
house
he
was
absent
for
about
five
minutes
and
then
his
head
peeped
over
the
edge
accompanied
by
the
hooks
of
an
iron
ladder
from
the
he
informed
them
as
they
stood
clear
for
the
thing
to
drop
it
proved
to
be
little
more
than
half
the
height
of
the
wall
saskia
ascended
first
and
had
no
difficulty
in
pulling
herself
over
the
parapet
then
came
the
guns
and
ammunition
and
then
the
sime
who
turned
out
to
be
an
athlete
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
getting
up
the
last
three
sir
archie
anathematised
his
frailties
nice
old
crock
to
go
with
he
told
the
princess
but
set
me
to
something
where
my
confounded
leg
do
get
in
the
way
and
i
still
pretty
useful
dougal
mopping
his
brow
with
the
rag
he
called
his
handkerchief
observed
sourly
that
he
objected
to
going
scouting
with
a
herd
of
elephants
once
indoors
his
spirits
rose
the
party
from
the
mains
had
brought
several
electric
torches
and
the
one
lamp
was
presently
found
and
lit
we
ca
count
on
the
polis
dougal
announced
and
when
the
foreigners
is
finished
wi
the
tower
they
come
on
here
if
no
we
must
make
them
what
is
it
the
sodgers
call
it
forcin
a
battle
now
see
here
there
the
two
roads
into
this
place
the
back
door
and
the
verandy
leavin
out
the
front
door
which
is
chained
and
lockit
try
those
two
roads
first
and
we
must
get
them
well
barricaded
in
time
but
mind
if
there
a
good
few
o
them
it
be
an
easy
job
to
batter
in
the
front
door
or
the
windies
so
we
maun
be
ready
for
that
he
told
off
a
fatigue
party
the
princess
sir
archie
and
mcguffog
to
help
in
moving
furniture
to
the
several
doors
sime
and
carfrae
attended
to
the
kitchen
entrance
while
he
himself
made
a
tour
of
the
windows
for
half
an
hour
the
empty
house
was
loud
with
strange
sounds
mcguffog
who
was
a
giant
in
strength
filled
the
passage
at
the
verandah
end
with
an
assortment
of
furniture
ranging
from
a
grand
piano
to
a
vast
mahogany
sofa
while
saskia
and
sir
archie
pillaged
the
bedrooms
and
packed
up
the
interstices
with
mattresses
in
lieu
of
sandbags
dougal
on
his
return
saw
fit
to
approve
their
work
that
fickle
the
blagyirds
down
at
the
kitchen
door
we
got
a
mangle
five
and
the
best
part
of
a
ton
o
coal
it
the
windies
i
anxious
about
for
they
ower
big
to
fill
up
but
gotten
tubs
o
water
below
them
and
a
lot
o
i
fund
in
the
cellar
sir
archie
morosely
wiped
his
brow
i
ca
say
i
ever
hated
a
job
more
he
told
saskia
it
seems
pretty
cool
to
march
into
somebody
else
house
and
make
free
with
his
furniture
i
hope
to
goodness
our
friends
from
the
sea
do
turn
up
or
we
look
pretty
foolish
loudon
will
have
a
score
against
me
he
wo
forget
ye
no
weakenin
asked
dougal
fiercely
not
a
bit
only
hopin
somebody
has
made
a
mighty
big
mistake
ye
need
be
feared
for
that
now
you
listen
to
your
instructions
we
terrible
few
for
such
a
big
place
but
we
maun
make
up
for
shortness
o
numbers
by
extra
mobility
the
gemkeeper
will
keep
the
windy
that
looks
on
the
verandy
and
fell
any
man
that
gets
through
you
hold
the
verandy
door
and
the
ither
lame
man
carfrae
ye
call
him
will
keep
the
back
door
i
telled
the
man
who
has
some
kind
of
a
head
on
him
that
he
maun
keep
on
the
move
to
see
if
they
try
the
front
door
or
any
o
the
other
windies
if
they
do
he
takes
his
station
there
d
follow
sir
archie
nodded
gloomily
what
is
my
post
saskia
asked
i
appointed
ye
my
chief
of
staff
was
the
answer
ye
see
we
no
reserves
if
this
door
the
dangerous
bit
it
maun
be
reinforced
from
elsewhere
and
that
want
savage
thinkin
ye
have
to
be
ay
on
the
move
mem
and
keep
me
informed
if
they
break
in
at
two
bits
beat
and
there
be
nothin
for
it
but
to
retire
to
our
last
position
ye
ken
the
room
ayont
the
hall
where
they
keep
the
coats
that
our
last
trench
and
at
the
worst
we
fall
back
there
and
stick
it
out
it
has
a
strong
door
and
a
wee
windy
so
they
no
be
able
to
get
in
on
our
rear
we
should
be
able
to
put
up
a
good
defence
there
unless
they
fire
the
place
over
our
heads
now
we
better
give
out
the
guns
we
do
want
any
shootin
if
we
can
avoid
it
said
sir
archie
who
found
his
distaste
for
dougal
growing
though
he
was
under
the
spell
of
the
one
being
there
who
knew
precisely
his
own
mind
just
what
i
was
goin
to
say
my
instructions
is
reserve
your
fire
and
do
loose
off
till
you
have
a
man
up
against
the
end
o
your
barrel
good
lord
we
get
into
a
horrible
row
the
whole
thing
may
be
a
mistake
and
we
be
had
up
for
wholesale
homicide
no
man
shall
fire
unless
i
give
the
word
the
looked
at
him
darkly
some
bitter
retort
was
on
his
tongue
but
he
restrained
himself
it
appears
he
said
that
ye
think
i
doin
all
this
for
fun
no
wi
ye
there
can
be
just
the
one
general
in
a
battle
but
give
ye
permission
to
say
the
word
when
to
fire
macgreegor
he
muttered
a
strange
expletive
only
used
in
moments
of
deep
emotion
i
wager
ye
be
for
sayin
the
word
afore
i
say
it
mysel
he
turned
to
the
princess
i
hand
over
to
you
till
i
am
back
for
i
maun
be
off
and
see
to
the
i
wish
i
could
bring
them
in
here
but
i
dare
lose
my
communications
i
likely
get
in
by
the
skylight
when
i
come
back
but
it
might
be
as
well
to
keep
a
road
open
here
unless
ye
actually
attacked
dougal
clambered
over
the
mattresses
and
the
grand
piano
a
flicker
of
waning
daylight
appeared
for
a
second
as
he
squeezed
through
the
door
and
sir
archie
was
left
staring
at
the
wrathful
countenance
of
mcguffog
he
laughed
ruefully
i
been
in
about
forty
battles
and
here
that
little
devil
rather
worried
about
my
pluck
and
talkin
to
me
like
a
corps
commander
to
a
newly
joined
all
the
same
he
a
remarkable
child
and
we
better
behave
as
if
we
were
in
for
a
real
shindy
what
do
you
think
princess
i
think
we
are
in
for
what
you
call
a
shindy
i
am
in
command
remember
i
order
you
to
serve
out
the
guns
this
was
done
a
and
a
hundred
cartridges
to
each
while
mcguffog
who
was
a
marksman
was
also
given
a
sporting
mannlicher
and
two
other
rifles
a
and
a
holland
were
kept
in
reserve
in
the
hall
sir
archie
free
from
dougal
compelling
presence
gave
the
gamekeeper
peremptory
orders
not
to
shoot
till
he
was
bidden
and
carfrae
at
the
kitchen
door
was
warned
to
the
same
effect
the
shuttered
house
where
the
only
light
apart
from
the
was
the
feeble
spark
of
the
electric
torches
had
the
most
disastrous
effect
upon
his
spirits
the
gale
which
roared
in
the
chimney
and
eddied
among
the
rafters
of
the
hall
seemed
an
infernal
commotion
in
a
tomb
let
go
upstairs
he
told
saskia
there
must
be
a
view
from
the
upper
windows
you
can
see
the
top
of
the
old
tower
and
part
of
the
sea
she
said
i
know
it
well
for
it
was
my
only
amusement
to
look
at
it
on
clear
days
too
one
could
see
high
mountains
far
in
the
west
his
depression
seemed
to
have
affected
her
for
she
spoke
listlessly
unlike
the
vivid
creature
who
had
led
the
way
in
in
a
gaunt
bedroom
the
one
in
which
heritage
and
dickson
had
camped
the
night
before
they
opened
a
fold
of
the
shutters
and
looked
out
into
a
world
of
grey
wrack
and
driving
rain
the
tower
roof
showed
mistily
beyond
the
ridge
of
down
but
its
environs
were
not
in
their
prospect
the
lower
regions
of
the
house
had
been
gloomy
enough
but
this
bleak
place
with
its
drab
outlook
struck
a
chill
to
sir
archie
soul
he
dolefully
lit
a
cigarette
this
is
a
pretty
rotten
show
for
you
he
told
her
it
strikes
me
as
a
rather
unpleasant
brand
of
nightmare
i
have
been
living
with
nightmares
for
three
years
she
said
wearily
he
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
i
think
the
kennedys
were
mad
to
build
this
confounded
barrack
i
always
disliked
it
and
old
quentin
any
use
for
it
either
cold
cheerless
raw
monstrosity
it
has
been
a
very
giddy
place
for
you
princess
it
has
been
my
prison
when
i
hoped
it
would
be
a
sanctuary
but
it
may
yet
be
my
salvation
i
sure
i
hope
so
i
say
you
must
be
jolly
hungry
i
do
suppose
there
any
chance
of
tea
for
you
she
shook
her
head
she
was
looking
fixedly
at
the
tower
as
if
she
expected
something
to
appear
there
and
he
followed
her
eyes
rum
old
shell
that
quentin
used
to
keep
all
kinds
of
live
stock
there
and
when
we
were
boys
it
was
our
castle
where
we
played
at
robber
chiefs
it
be
dashed
queer
if
the
real
thing
should
turn
up
this
time
i
suppose
mccunn
poet
is
roostin
there
all
by
his
lone
ca
say
i
envy
him
his
job
suddenly
she
caught
his
arm
i
see
a
man
she
whispered
there
he
is
behind
those
far
bushes
there
is
his
head
again
it
was
clearly
a
man
but
he
presently
disappeared
for
he
had
come
round
by
the
south
end
of
the
house
past
the
stables
and
had
now
gone
over
the
ridge
the
cut
of
his
jib
is
uncommonly
like
loudon
the
factor
i
thought
mccunn
had
stretched
him
on
a
bed
of
pain
lord
if
this
thing
should
turn
out
a
farce
i
simply
ca
face
loudon
i
say
princess
you
do
suppose
by
any
chance
that
mccunn
a
little
bit
wrong
in
the
head
she
turned
her
candid
eyes
on
him
you
are
in
a
very
doubting
mood
my
feet
are
cold
and
i
do
mind
admittin
it
hanged
if
i
know
what
it
is
but
i
do
feel
this
show
a
bit
real
if
it
is
we
in
a
fair
way
to
make
howlin
idiots
of
ourselves
and
get
pretty
well
embroiled
with
the
law
it
all
right
for
the
boy
for
he
can
take
everything
seriously
even
play
i
could
do
the
same
thing
myself
when
i
was
a
kid
i
do
mind
runnin
some
kinds
of
risk
had
a
few
in
my
time
but
this
is
so
infernally
outlandish
and
i
i
do
quite
believe
in
it
that
is
to
say
i
believe
in
it
right
enough
when
i
look
at
you
or
listen
to
mccunn
but
as
soon
as
my
eyes
are
off
you
i
begin
to
doubt
again
i
gettin
old
and
i
a
stake
in
the
country
and
i
daresay
i
gettin
a
bit
of
a
prig
anyway
i
do
want
to
make
a
jackass
of
myself
besides
there
this
foul
weather
and
this
beastly
house
to
ice
my
feet
he
broke
off
with
an
exclamation
for
on
the
grey
stage
in
which
the
roof
of
the
tower
was
the
central
feature
actors
had
appeared
dim
hurrying
shapes
showed
through
the
mist
dipping
over
the
ridge
as
if
coming
from
the
garplefoot
she
seized
his
arm
and
he
saw
that
her
listlessness
was
gone
her
eyes
were
shining
it
is
they
she
cried
the
nightmare
is
real
at
last
do
you
doubt
now
he
could
only
stare
for
these
shapes
arriving
and
vanishing
like
wisps
of
fog
still
seemed
to
him
phantasmal
the
girl
held
his
arm
tightly
clutched
and
craned
towards
the
window
space
he
tried
to
open
the
frame
and
succeeded
in
smashing
the
glass
a
swirl
of
wind
drove
inwards
and
blew
a
loose
lock
of
saskia
hair
across
his
brow
i
wish
dougal
were
back
he
muttered
and
then
came
the
crack
of
a
shot
the
pressure
on
his
arm
slackened
and
a
pale
face
was
turned
to
him
he
is
alone
heritage
he
has
no
chance
they
will
kill
him
like
a
dog
they
never
get
in
he
assured
her
dougal
said
the
place
could
hold
out
for
hours
another
shot
followed
and
presently
a
third
she
twined
her
hands
and
her
eyes
were
wild
we
ca
leave
him
to
be
killed
she
gasped
it
the
only
game
we
playin
for
time
remember
besides
he
be
killed
great
scott
as
he
spoke
a
sudden
explosion
cleft
the
drone
of
the
wind
and
a
patch
of
gloom
flashed
into
yellow
light
bomb
he
cried
lord
i
might
have
thought
of
that
the
girl
had
sprung
back
from
the
window
i
can
not
bear
it
i
will
not
see
him
murdered
in
sight
of
his
friends
i
am
going
to
show
myself
and
when
they
see
me
they
will
leave
him
no
you
must
stay
here
presently
they
will
be
round
this
house
do
be
afraid
for
me
i
am
very
quick
of
foot
for
god
sake
do

princess
stop
and
he
clutched
at
her
skirt
look
here
i
go
you
ca
you
have
been
wounded
i
am
in
command
you
know
keep
the
door
open
till
i
come
back
he
hobbled
after
her
but
she
easily
eluded
him
she
was
smiling
now
and
blew
a
kiss
to
him
la
la
la
she
trilled
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
he
heard
her
voice
below
admonishing
mcguffog
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
back
to
the
window
he
had
brought
the
little
holland
with
him
and
he
poked
its
barrel
through
the
hole
in
the
glass
curse
my
game
leg
he
said
almost
cheerfully
for
the
situation
was
now
becoming
one
with
which
he
could
cope
i
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
up
the
pursuit
a
bit
my
aunt
what
a
girl
with
the
rifle
cuddled
to
his
shoulder
he
watched
a
slim
figure
come
into
sight
on
the
lawn
running
towards
the
ridge
he
reflected
that
she
must
have
dropped
from
the
high
verandah
wall
that
reminded
him
that
something
must
be
done
to
make
the
wall
climbable
for
her
return
so
he
went
down
to
mcguffog
and
the
two
squeezed
through
the
barricaded
door
to
the
verandah
the
ladder
was
still
in
position
but
it
did
not
reach
half
the
height
so
mcguffog
was
adjured
to
stand
by
to
help
and
in
the
meantime
to
wait
on
duty
by
the
wall
then
he
hurried
upstairs
to
his
the
girl
was
in
sight
almost
on
the
crest
of
the
high
ground
there
she
stood
for
a
moment
one
hand
clutching
at
her
errant
hair
the
other
shielding
her
eyes
from
the
sting
of
the
rain
he
heard
her
cry
as
heritage
had
heard
her
but
since
the
wind
was
blowing
towards
him
the
sound
came
louder
and
fuller
again
she
cried
and
then
stood
motionless
with
her
hands
above
her
head
it
was
only
for
an
instant
for
the
next
he
saw
she
had
turned
and
was
racing
down
the
slope
jumping
the
little
scrogs
of
hazel
like
a
deer
on
the
ridge
appeared
faces
and
then
over
it
swept
a
mob
of
men
she
had
a
start
of
some
fifty
yards
and
laboured
to
increase
it
having
doubtless
the
verandah
wall
in
mind
sir
archie
sick
with
anxiety
nevertheless
spared
time
to
admire
her
prowess
gad
she
a
miler
he
ejaculated
she
do
it
i
hanged
if
she
do
do
it
against
men
in
seaman
boots
and
heavy
clothing
she
had
a
clear
advantage
but
two
shook
themselves
loose
from
the
pack
and
began
to
gain
on
her
at
the
main
shrubbery
they
were
not
thirty
yards
behind
and
in
her
passage
through
it
her
skirts
must
have
delayed
her
for
when
she
emerged
the
pursuit
had
halved
the
distance
he
got
the
sights
of
the
rifle
on
the
first
man
but
the
lawns
sloped
up
towards
the
house
and
to
his
consternation
he
found
that
the
girl
was
in
the
line
of
fire
madly
he
ran
to
the
other
window
of
the
room
tore
back
the
shutters
shivered
the
glass
and
flung
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
the
fellow
was
within
three
yards
of
her
but
thank
god
he
had
now
a
clear
field
he
fired
low
and
just
ahead
of
him
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
him
drop
like
a
rabbit
shot
in
the
leg
his
companion
stumbled
over
him
and
for
a
moment
the
girl
was
safe
but
her
speed
was
failing
she
passed
out
of
sight
on
the
verandah
side
of
the
house
and
the
rest
of
the
pack
had
gained
ominously
over
the
easier
ground
of
the
lawn
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
trying
to
stop
them
by
his
fire
but
realised
that
if
every
shot
told
there
would
still
be
enough
of
them
left
to
make
sure
of
her
capture
the
only
chance
was
at
the
verandah
and
he
went
downstairs
at
a
pace
undreamed
of
since
the
days
when
he
had
two
whole
legs
mcguffog
mannlicher
in
hand
was
poking
his
neck
over
the
wall
the
pursuit
had
turned
the
corner
and
were
about
twenty
yards
off
the
girl
was
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
breathless
drooping
with
fatigue
she
tried
to
climb
limply
and
feebly
and
very
slowly
as
if
she
were
too
giddy
to
see
clear
above
were
two
cripples
and
at
her
back
the
van
of
the
now
triumphant
pack
sir
archie
game
leg
or
no
was
on
the
parapet
preparing
to
drop
down
and
hold
off
the
pursuit
were
it
only
for
seconds
but
at
that
moment
he
was
aware
that
the
situation
had
changed
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
a
tall
man
seemed
to
have
sprung
out
of
the
ground
he
caught
the
girl
in
his
arms
climbed
the
ladder
and
mcguffog
great
hands
reached
down
and
seized
her
and
swung
her
into
safety
up
the
wall
by
means
of
cracks
and
tufts
was
shinning
a
small
boy
the
stranger
coolly
faced
the
pursuers
and
at
the
sight
of
him
they
checked
those
behind
stumbling
against
those
in
front
he
was
speaking
to
them
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
to
sir
archie
ear
the
words
were
like
the
crack
of
a
lash
the
hesitation
was
only
for
a
moment
for
a
voice
among
them
cried
out
and
the
whole
pack
gave
tongue
shrilly
and
surged
on
again
but
that
instant
of
check
had
given
the
stranger
his
chance
he
was
up
the
ladder
and
gripping
the
parapet
found
rest
for
his
feet
in
a
fissure
then
he
bent
down
drew
up
the
ladder
handed
it
to
mcguffog
and
with
a
mighty
heave
pulled
himself
over
the
top
he
seemed
to
hope
to
defend
the
verandah
but
the
door
at
the
west
end
was
being
assailed
by
a
contingent
of
the
enemy
and
he
saw
that
its
thin
woodwork
was
yielding
into
the
house
he
cried
as
he
picked
up
the
ladder
and
tossed
it
over
the
wall
on
the
pack
surging
below
he
was
only
just
in
time
for
the
west
door
yielded
in
two
steps
he
had
followed
mcguffog
through
the
chink
into
the
passage
and
the
concussion
of
the
grand
piano
pushed
hard
against
the
verandah
door
from
within
coincided
with
the
first
battering
on
the
said
door
from
without
in
the
the
feeble
lamp
showed
a
strange
grouping
saskia
had
sunk
into
a
chair
to
get
her
breath
and
seemed
too
dazed
to
be
aware
of
her
surroundings
dougal
was
manfully
striving
to
appear
at
his
ease
but
his
lip
was
quivering
a
near
thing
that
time
he
observed
it
was
the
blame
of
that
auld
the
stranger
cast
sharp
eyes
around
the
place
and
company
an
awkward
corner
gentlemen
he
said
how
many
are
there
of
you
four
men
and
a
boy
and
you
have
placed
guards
at
all
the
entrances
they
have
bombs
sir
archie
reminded
him
no
doubt
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
use
them
here
or
their
guns
unless
there
is
no
other
way
their
purpose
is
kidnapping
and
they
hope
to
do
it
secretly
and
slip
off
without
leaving
a
trace
if
they
slaughter
us
as
they
easily
can
the
cry
will
be
out
against
them
and
their
vessel
will
be
unpleasantly
hunted
half
their
purpose
is
already
spoiled
for
it
is
no
longer
secret
they
may
break
us
by
sheer
weight
and
i
fancy
the
first
shooting
will
be
done
by
us
it
the
windows
i
afraid
of
some
tone
in
his
quiet
voice
reached
the
girl
in
the
wicker
chair
she
looked
up
wildly
saw
him
and
with
a
cry
of
alesha
ran
to
his
arms
there
she
hung
while
his
hand
fondled
her
hair
like
a
mother
with
a
scared
child
sir
archie
watching
the
whole
thing
in
some
stupefaction
thought
he
had
never
in
his
days
seen
more
nobly
matched
human
creatures
it
is
my
friend
she
cried
triumphantly
the
friend
whom
i
appointed
to
meet
me
here
oh
i
did
well
to
trust
him
now
we
need
not
fear
anything
as
if
in
ironical
answer
came
a
great
crashing
at
the
verandah
door
and
the
twanging
of
chords
cruelly
mishandled
the
grand
piano
was
suffering
internally
from
the
assaults
of
the
ladder
wull
i
gie
them
a
shot
was
mcguffog
hoarse
inquiry
action
stations
alexis
ordered
for
the
command
seemed
to
have
shifted
to
him
from
dougal
the
windows
are
the
danger
the
boy
will
patrol
the
ground
floor
and
give
us
warning
and
i
and
this
man
pointing
to
sime
will
be
ready
at
the
threatened
point
and
for
sake
no
shooting
unless
i
give
the
word
if
we
take
them
on
at
that
game
we
have
a
chance
he
said
something
to
saskia
in
russian
and
she
smiled
assent
and
went
to
sir
archie
side
you
and
i
must
keep
this
door
she
said
sir
archie
was
never
very
clear
afterwards
about
the
events
of
the
next
hour
the
princess
was
in
the
maddest
spirits
as
if
the
burden
of
three
years
had
slipped
from
her
and
she
was
back
in
her
first
girlhood
she
sang
as
she
carried
more
lumber
to
the
pile
perhaps
the
song
which
had
once
entranced
heritage
but
sir
archie
had
no
ear
for
music
she
mocked
at
the
furious
blows
which
rained
at
the
other
end
for
the
door
had
gone
now
and
in
the
windy
gap
could
be
seen
a
blur
of
dark
faces
oddly
enough
he
found
his
own
spirits
mounting
to
meet
hers
it
was
real
business
at
last
the
qualms
of
the
civilian
had
been
forgotten
and
there
was
rising
in
him
that
joy
in
a
scrap
which
had
once
made
him
one
of
the
most
daring
airmen
on
the
western
front
the
only
thing
that
worried
him
now
was
the
coyness
about
shooting
what
on
earth
were
his
rifles
and
for
unless
to
be
used
he
had
seen
the
enemy
from
the
verandah
wall
and
a
more
ruffianly
crew
he
had
never
dreamed
of
they
meant
the
uttermost
business
and
against
such
it
was
surely
the
duty
of
good
citizens
to
wage
war
the
princess
was
humming
to
herself
a
nursery
rhyme
the
king
of
spain
daughter
she
crooned
came
to
visit
me
and
all
for
the
sake
oh
that
poor
piano
in
her
clear
voice
she
cried
something
in
russian
and
the
wind
carried
a
laugh
from
the
verandah
at
the
sound
of
it
she
stopped
i
had
forgotten
she
said
paul
is
there
i
had
forgotten
after
that
she
was
very
quiet
but
she
redoubled
her
labours
at
the
barricade
to
the
man
it
seemed
that
the
pressure
from
without
was
slackening
he
called
to
mcguffog
to
ask
about
the
window
and
the
reply
was
reassuring
the
gamekeeper
was
gloomily
contemplating
dougal
tubs
of
water
and
as
he
might
have
contemplated
a
vermin
trap
sir
archie
was
growing
acutely
anxious
the
anxiety
of
the
defender
of
a
straggling
fortress
which
is
vulnerable
at
a
dozen
points
it
seemed
to
him
that
strange
noises
were
coming
from
the
rooms
beyond
the
hall
did
the
back
door
lie
that
way
and
was
not
there
a
smell
of
smoke
in
the
air
if
they
tried
fire
in
such
a
gale
the
place
would
burn
like
matchwood
he
left
his
post
and
in
the
hall
found
dougal
all
quiet
the
chieftain
reported
far
ower
quiet
i
do
like
it
the
enemy
no
puttin
out
his
strength
yet
the
russian
says
a
the
west
windies
are
terrible
dangerous
him
and
the
chauffeur
doin
their
best
but
ye
ca
block
thae
muckle
glass
panes
he
returned
to
the
princess
and
found
that
the
attack
had
indeed
languished
on
that
particular
barricade
the
withers
of
the
grand
piano
were
left
unwrung
and
only
a
faint
scuffling
informed
him
that
the
verandah
was
not
empty
they
gathering
for
an
attack
elsewhere
he
told
himself
but
what
if
that
attack
were
a
feint
he
and
mcguffog
must
stick
to
their
post
for
in
his
belief
the
verandah
door
and
the
window
were
the
easiest
places
where
an
entry
in
mass
could
be
forced
suddenly
dougal
whistle
blew
and
with
it
came
a
most
almighty
crash
somewhere
towards
the
west
side
with
a
shout
of
hold
tight
mcguffog
sir
archie
bolted
into
the
hall
and
led
by
the
sound
reached
what
had
once
been
the
ladies
bedroom
a
strange
sight
met
his
eyes
for
the
whole
framework
of
one
window
seemed
to
have
been
thrust
inward
and
in
the
gap
alexis
was
swinging
a
fender
three
of
the
enemy
were
in
the
room
one
senseless
on
the
floor
one
in
the
grip
of
sime
whose
single
hand
was
tightly
clenched
on
his
throat
and
one
engaged
with
dougal
in
a
corner
the
leader
was
sore
pressed
and
to
his
help
sir
archie
went
the
fresh
assault
made
the
seaman
duck
his
head
and
dougal
seized
the
occasion
to
smite
him
hard
with
something
which
caused
him
to
roll
over
it
was
spidel
which
he
had
annexed
that
afternoon
alexis
at
the
window
seemed
to
have
for
a
moment
daunted
the
attack
bring
that
table
he
cried
and
the
thing
was
jammed
into
the
gap
now
you
this
to
sime
get
the
man
from
the
back
door
to
hold
this
place
with
his
gun
there
no
attack
there
it
about
time
for
shooting
now
or
we
have
them
in
our
rear
what
in
heaven
is
that
it
was
mcguffog
whose
great
bellow
resounded
down
the
corridor
sir
archie
turned
and
shuffled
back
to
be
met
by
a
distressing
spectacle
the
lamp
burning
as
peacefully
as
it
might
have
burned
on
an
old
revealed
the
window
of
the
driven
bodily
inward
shutters
and
all
and
now
forming
an
inclined
bridge
over
ineffectual
tubs
in
front
of
it
stood
mcguffog
swinging
his
gun
by
the
barrel
and
yelling
curses
which
being
mainly
couched
in
the
vernacular
were
happily
meaningless
to
saskia
she
herself
stood
at
the
hall
door
plucking
at
something
hidden
in
her
breast
he
saw
that
it
was
a
little
pistol
the
enemy
feint
had
succeeded
for
even
as
sir
archie
looked
three
men
leaped
into
the
room
on
the
neck
of
one
the
butt
of
mcguffog
gun
crashed
but
two
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
made
for
the
girl
sir
archie
met
the
first
with
his
fist
a
clean
drive
on
the
jaw
followed
by
a
damaging
hook
with
his
left
that
put
him
out
of
action
the
other
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
was
lost
for
mcguffog
caught
him
by
the
waist
from
behind
and
sent
him
through
the
broken
frame
to
join
his
comrades
without
up
the
stairs
dougal
was
shouting
for
the
little
room
beyond
the
hall
was
clearly
impossible
our
flank
turned
they
through
the
other
windy
out
of
a
corner
of
his
eye
sir
archie
caught
sight
of
alexis
with
sime
and
carfrae
in
support
being
slowly
forced
towards
them
along
the
corridor
upstairs
he
shouted
come
on
mcguffog
lead
on
princess
he
dashed
out
the
lamp
and
the
place
was
in
darkness
with
this
retreat
from
the
forward
trench
line
ended
the
opening
phase
of
the
battle
it
was
achieved
in
good
order
and
position
was
taken
up
on
the
landing
dominating
the
main
staircase
and
the
passage
that
led
to
the
back
stairs
at
their
back
was
a
short
corridor
ending
in
a
window
which
gave
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
above
the
verandah
and
from
which
an
active
man
might
descend
to
the
verandah
roof
it
had
been
carefully
reconnoitred
beforehand
by
dougal
and
his
were
the
dispositions
the
odd
thing
was
that
the
retreating
force
were
in
good
heart
the
three
men
from
the
mains
were
warming
to
their
work
and
mcguffog
wore
an
air
of
genial
ferocity
dashed
fine
position
i
call
this
said
sir
archie
only
alexis
was
silent
and
preoccupied
we
are
still
at
their
mercy
he
said
pray
god
your
police
come
soon
he
forbade
shooting
yet
awhile
the
lady
is
our
strong
card
he
said
they
wo
use
their
guns
while
she
is
with
us
but
if
it
ever
comes
to
shooting
they
can
wipe
us
out
in
a
couple
of
minutes
one
of
you
watch
that
window
for
paul
abreskov
is
no
fool
their
exhilaration
was
below
in
the
hall
it
was
black
darkness
save
for
a
greyness
at
the
entrance
of
the
verandah
passage
but
the
defence
was
soon
aware
that
the
place
was
thick
with
men
presently
there
came
a
scuffling
from
carfrae
post
towards
the
back
stairs
and
a
cry
as
of
some
one
choking
and
at
the
same
moment
a
flare
was
lit
below
which
brought
the
whole
hall
from
floor
to
rafters
into
blinding
light
it
revealed
a
crowd
of
figures
some
still
in
the
hall
and
some
up
the
stairs
and
it
revealed
too
more
figures
at
the
end
of
the
upper
landing
where
carfrae
had
been
stationed
the
shapes
were
motionless
like
mannequins
in
a
shop
window
they
got
us
treed
all
right
sir
archie
groaned
what
the
devil
are
they
waiting
for
they
wait
for
their
leader
said
alexis
no
one
of
the
party
will
ever
forget
the
ensuing
minutes
after
the
hubbub
of
the
barricades
the
ominous
silence
was
like
icy
water
chilling
and
petrifying
with
an
indefinable
fear
there
was
no
sound
but
the
wind
but
presently
mingled
with
it
came
odd
wild
voices
hear
to
the
whaups
mcguffog
whispered
sir
archie
who
found
the
tension
unbearable
sought
relief
in
contradiction
you
an
unscientific
brute
mcguffog
he
told
his
henchman
it
a
disgrace
that
a
gamekeeper
should
be
such
a
rotten
naturalist
what
would
whaups
be
doin
here
at
this
time
of
year
a
the
same
i
could
swear
it
whaups
sir
erchibald
then
dougal
broke
in
and
his
voice
was
excited
it
no
whaups
our
patrol
signal
man
there
hope
for
us
yet
i
believe
it
the
polis
his
words
were
unheeded
for
the
figures
below
drew
apart
and
a
young
man
came
through
them
his
dark
head
was
bare
and
as
he
moved
he
unbuttoned
his
oilskins
and
showed
the
trim
garb
of
the
yachtsman
he
walked
confidently
up
the
stairs
an
odd
elegant
figure
among
his
heavy
companions
good
afternoon
alexis
he
said
in
english
i
think
we
may
now
regard
this
interesting
episode
as
closed
i
take
it
that
you
surrender
saskia
dear
you
are
coming
with
me
on
a
little
journey
will
you
tell
my
men
where
to
find
your
baggage
the
reply
was
in
russian
alexis
voice
was
as
cool
as
the
other
and
it
seemed
to
wake
him
to
anger
he
replied
in
a
rapid
torrent
of
words
and
appealed
to
the
men
below
who
shouted
back
the
flare
was
dying
down
and
shadows
again
hid
most
of
the
hall
dougal
crept
up
behind
sir
archie
here
i
think
it
the
polis
they
whistlin
outbye
and
i
hear
folk
cryin
to
each
other
no
the
foreigners
again
alexis
spoke
and
then
saskia
joined
in
what
she
said
rang
sharp
with
contempt
and
her
fingers
played
with
her
little
pistol
suddenly
before
the
young
man
could
answer
dobson
bustled
towards
him
the
innkeeper
was
labouring
under
some
strong
emotion
for
he
seemed
to
be
pleading
and
pointing
urgently
towards
the
door
i
tell
ye
it
the
polis
whispered
dougal
they
nickit
there
was
a
swaying
in
the
crowd
and
anxious
faces
men
surged
in
whispered
and
went
out
and
a
clamour
arose
which
the
leader
stilled
with
a
fierce
gesture
you
there
he
cried
looking
up
you
english
we
mean
you
no
ill
but
i
require
you
to
hand
over
to
me
the
lady
and
the
russian
who
is
with
her
i
give
you
a
minute
by
my
watch
to
decide
if
you
refuse
my
men
are
behind
you
and
around
you
and
you
go
with
me
to
be
punished
at
my
leisure
i
warn
you
cried
sir
archie
we
are
armed
and
will
shoot
down
any
one
who
dares
to
lay
a
hand
on
us
you
fool
came
the
answer
i
can
send
you
all
to
eternity
before
you
touch
a
trigger
l√©on
was
by
his
side
now
l√©on
and
spidel
imploring
him
to
do
something
which
he
angrily
refused
outside
there
was
a
new
clamour
faces
showing
at
the
door
and
then
vanishing
and
an
anxious
hum
filled
the
hall
dobson
appeared
again
and
this
time
he
was
a
figure
of
fury
are
ye
daft
man
he
cried
i
tell
ye
the
polis
are
closin
round
us
and
there
no
a
moment
to
lose
if
we
would
get
back
to
the
boats
if
ye
no
think
o
your
own
neck
i
thinkin
o
mine
the
whole
thing
a
bloody
misfire
come
on
lads
if
ye
no
besotted
on
destruction
l√©on
laid
a
hand
on
the
leader
arm
and
was
roughly
shaken
off
spidel
fared
no
better
and
the
little
group
on
the
upper
landing
saw
the
two
shrug
their
shoulders
and
make
for
the
door
the
hall
was
emptying
fast
and
the
watchers
had
gone
from
the
back
stairs
the
young
man
voice
rose
to
a
scream
he
commanded
threatened
cursed
but
panic
was
in
the
air
and
he
had
lost
his
mastery
quick
croaked
dougal
now
the
time
for
the
but
the
figure
on
the
stairs
held
them
motionless
they
could
not
see
his
face
but
by
instinct
they
knew
that
it
was
distraught
with
fury
and
defeat
the
flare
blazed
up
again
as
the
flame
caught
a
knot
of
fresh
powder
and
once
more
the
place
was
bright
with
the
uncanny
light
the
hall
was
empty
save
for
the
pale
man
who
was
in
the
act
of
turning
he
looked
back
if
i
go
now
i
will
return
the
world
is
not
wide
enough
to
hide
you
from
me
saskia
you
will
never
get
her
said
alexis
a
sudden
devil
flamed
into
his
eyes
the
devil
of
some
ancestral
savagery
which
would
destroy
what
is
desired
but
unattainable
he
swung
round
his
hand
went
to
his
pocket
something
clicked
and
his
arm
shot
out
like
a
baseball
pitcher
so
intent
was
the
gaze
of
the
others
on
him
that
they
did
not
see
a
second
figure
ascending
the
stairs
just
as
alexis
flung
himself
before
the
princess
the
caught
the
young
man
outstretched
arm
and
wrenched
something
from
his
hand
the
next
second
he
had
hurled
it
into
a
far
corner
where
stood
the
great
fireplace
there
was
a
blinding
sheet
of
flame
a
dull
roar
and
then
billow
upon
billow
of
acrid
smoke
as
it
cleared
they
saw
that
the
fine
italian
chimneypiece
the
pride
of
the
builder
of
the
house
was
a
mass
of
splinters
and
that
a
great
hole
had
been
blown
through
the
wall
into
what
had
been
the
a
figure
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
step
feeling
its
bruises
the
last
enemy
had
gone
when
john
heritage
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
the
princess
with
a
very
pale
face
in
the
arms
of
a
tall
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
if
he
was
surprised
at
the
sight
he
did
not
show
it
nasty
little
bomb
that
time
fuse
i
remember
we
struck
the
brand
first
in
july
are
they
rounded
up
sir
archie
asked
they
bolted
whether
they
get
away
is
another
matter
i
left
half
the
mounted
police
a
minute
ago
at
the
top
of
the
west
lodge
avenue
the
other
lot
went
to
the
garplefoot
to
cut
off
the
boats
good
lord
man
sir
archie
cried
the
police
have
been
here
for
the
last
ten
minutes
you
wrong
they
came
with
me
then
what
on
earth
began
the
astonished
baronet
he
stopped
short
for
he
suddenly
got
his
answer
into
the
hall
from
the
verandah
limped
a
boy
never
was
there
seen
so
ruinous
a
child
he
was
dripping
wet
his
shirt
was
all
but
torn
off
his
back
his
bleeding
nose
was
poorly
staunched
by
a
wisp
of
handkerchief
his
breeches
were
in
ribbons
and
his
poor
bare
legs
looked
as
if
they
had
been
comprehensively
kicked
and
scratched
limpingly
he
entered
yet
with
a
kind
of
pride
like
some
small
who
has
lost
most
of
his
plumage
but
has
vanquished
his
adversary
with
a
yell
dougal
went
down
the
stairs
the
boy
saluted
him
and
they
gravely
shook
hands
it
was
the
meeting
of
wellington
and
bl√ºcher
the
chieftain
voice
shrilled
in
triumph
but
there
was
a
break
in
it
the
glory
was
almost
too
great
to
be
borne
i
kenned
it
he
cried
it
was
the
gorbals
there
stands
the
man
that
done

chapter
xv
the
gorbals
go
into
action
we
left
mccunn
full
of
aches
but
desperately
resolute
in
spirit
hobbling
by
the
auchenlochan
road
into
the
village
of
dalquharter
his
goal
was
morran
which
was
thomas
yownie
de

come
on
again
and
though
in
other
weather
there
would
have
been
a
slow
twilight
already
the
shadow
of
night
had
the
world
in
its
grip
the
sea
even
from
the
high
ground
was
invisible
and
all
to
westward
and
windward
was
a
ragged
screen
of
dark
cloud
it
was
foul
weather
for
foul
deeds
thomas
yownie
was
not
in
the
but
in
morran
kitchen
and
with
him
were
the
boy
known
as
old
bill
and
the
sturdy
figure
of
peter
paterson
but
the
floor
was
held
by
the
hostess
she
still
wore
her
big
boots
her
petticoats
were
still
kilted
and
round
her
venerable
head
in

of

was
drawn
a
tartan
shawl

morran
attention
was
distracted
by
dickson
who
suddenly
felt
very
faint
and
sat
down
heavily
on
a
kitchen
chair
man
ye
as
white
as

exclaimed
with
compunction

a
cup
o

she
proved
to
be
in
the
right
for
as
soon
as
dickson
had
swallowed
some
mouthfuls
of
her
strong
scalding
brew
the
colour
came
back
to
his
cheeks
and
he
announced
that
he
felt
better
ye
fortify
it
wi
a
dram
she
told
him
and
produced
a
black
bottle
from
her
cupboard

back
door
opened
and
napoleon
entered
his
thin
shanks
blue
with
cold
he
saluted
and
made
his
report
in
a
voice
shrill
with
excitement
the
tower
has
fallen
they
blown
in
the
big
door
and
the
feck
them
inside
and
mr
heritage
was
dickson
anxious
inquiry
when
i
last
saw
him
he
was
up
at
a
windy
shootin
i
think
he
gotten
on
to
the
roof
i
wouldna
wonder
but
the
place
is
on
fire
here
this
is
awful
dickson
groaned
we
ca
let
heritage
be
killed
that
way
what
strength
is
the
enemy
i
counted
and
there
stragglers
comin
up
from
the
boats
and
there
me
and
you
five
laddies
here
and
dougal
and
the
others
shut
up
in
the
house
he
stopped
in
sheer
despair
it
was
a
fix
from
which
the
most
enlightened
business
mind
showed
no
escape
prudence
inventiveness
were
no
longer
in
question
only
some
desperate
course
of
violence
we
must
create
a
diversion
he
said
i
for
the
tower
and
you
laddies
must
come
with
me
we
maybe
see
a
chance
oh
but
i
wish
i
had
my
wee
pistol
if
ye
gaun
there
dickson
i
comin
wi
ye
morran
announced
her
words
revealed
to
dickson
the
preposterousness
of
the
whole
situation
and
for
all
his
anxiety
he
laughed
five
laddies
a
man
and
an
auld
wife
he
cried
dod
it
pretty
hopeless
it
like
the
thing
in
the
bible
about
the
weak
things
of
the
world
trying
to
confound
the
strong
the
bible
whiles
richt
morran
answered
drily
come
on
for
there
no
time
to
lose
the
door
opened
again
to
admit
the
figure
of
wee
jaikie
there
were
no
tears
in
his
eyes
and
his
face
was
very
white

be
away
with
the
princess
they
beaten
all
dougal
plans
and
it
a
straight
fight
with
odds
of
six
to
one
not
possible
morran
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
lose
hope
eh
the
puir
lassie
she
wailed
and
sinking
on
a
chair
covered
her
face
with
her
shawl
laddies
can
you
no
think
of
a
plan
asked
dickson
his
voice
flat
with
despair
then
thomas
yownie
spoke
so
far
he
had
been
silent
but
under
his
tangled
thatch
of
hair
his
mind
had
been
busy
jaikie
report
seemed
to
bring
him
to
a
decision
it
gey
dark
he
said
and
it
gettin
darker
there
was
that
in
his
voice
which
promised
something
and
dickson
listened
the
enemy
mostly
foreigners
but
dobson
there
and
i
think
he
a
kind
of
guide
to
them
dobson
feared
of
the
polis
and
if
we
can
terrify
dobson
he
terrify
the
rest
ay
but
where
are
the
police
they
no
here
yet
but
they
comin
the
fear
o
them
is
aye
in
dobson
mind
if
he
thinks
the
polis
has
arrived
he
put
the
wind
up
the
lot
maun
be
the
polis
dickson
could
only
stare
while
the
chief
of
staff
unfolded
his
scheme
i
do
not
know
to
whom
the
muse
of
history
will
give
the
credit
of
the
tactics
of
infiltration
whether
to
ludendorff
or
von
hutier
or
some
other
proud
captain
of
germany
or
to
foch
who
revised
and
perfected
them
but
i
know
that
the
same
notion
was
at
this
moment
of
crisis
conceived
by
thomas
yownie
whom
no
parents
acknowledged
who
slept
usually
in
a
coal
cellar
and
who
had
picked
up
his
education
among
gorbals
closes
and
along
the
wharves
of
clyde
it
gettin
dark
he
said
and
the
enemy
are
that
busy
tryin
to
break
into
the
hoose
that
they
no
be
thinkin
o
their
rear
the
five
o
us
is
grand
at
dodgin
and
keepin
out
of
sight
and
what
hinders
us
to
get
in
among
them
so
that
they
hear
us
but
never
see
us
we
used
to
the
ways
o
the
polis
and
can
imitate
them
fine
forbye
we
all
got
our
whistles
which
are
the
same
as
a
birl
and
old
bill
and
peter
are
grand
at
copyin
a
man
voice
since
the
captain
is
shut
up
in
the
hoose
the
command
falls
to
me
and
my
plan
with
a
piece
of
chalk
he
drew
on
the
kitchen
floor
a
rough
sketch
of
the
environs
of
huntingtower
peter
paterson
was
to
move
from
the
shrubberies
beyond
the
verandah
napoleon
from
the
stables
old
bill
from
the
tower
while
wee
jaikie
and
thomas
himself
were
to
advance
as
if
from
the
garplefoot
so
that
the
enemy
might
fear
for
his
communications
as
soon
as
one
o
ye
gets
into
position
he
to
gie
the
patrol
cry
and
when
each
o
ye
has
heard
five
cries
he
to
advance
begin
birlin
and
roarin
afore
ye
get
among
them
and
keep
it
up
till
ye
at
the
hoose
wall
if
they
gotten
inside
in
ye
go
after
them
i
trust
each
to
use
his
judgment
and
above
all
to
keep
out
sight
and
no
let
himsel
be
grippit
the
plan
like
all
great
tactics
was
simple
and
no
sooner
was
it
expounded
than
it
was
put
into
action
the
faded
out
of
the
kitchen
like
and
dickson
and
morran
were
left
looking
at
each
other
they
did
not
look
long
the
bare
feet
of
wee
jaikie
had
not
crossed
the
threshold
fifty
seconds
before
they
were
followed
by
morran
boots
and
dickson
tackets
arm
in
arm
the
two
hobbled
down
the
back
path
behind
the
village
which
led
to
the
south
lodge
the
gate
was
unlocked
for
the
warder
was
busy
elsewhere
and
they
hastened
up
the
avenue
far
off
dickson
thought
he
saw
shapes
fleeting
across
the
park
which
he
took
to
be
the
of
his
own
side
and
he
seemed
to
hear
snatches
of
song
jaikie
was
giving
tongue
and
this
was
what
he
sang
proley
tarians
arise
wave
the
red
flag
to
the
skies
heed
nae
mair
the
fat
man
lees
stap
them
doun
his
throat
nocht
to
loss
except
our
chains
we
maun
drain
oor
dearest
veins
a
the
worrld
shall
be
our
gains
but
he
tripped
over
a
rabbit
wire
and
thereafter
conserved
his
breath
the
wind
was
so
loud
that
no
sound
reached
them
from
the
house
which
blank
and
immense
now
loomed
before
them
dickson
ears
were
alert
for
the
noise
of
shots
or
the
dull
crash
of
bombs
hearing
nothing
he
feared
the
worst
and
hurried
morran
at
a
pace
which
endangered
her
life
he
had
no
fear
for
himself
arguing
that
his
foes
were
seeking
higher
game
and
judging
too
that
the
main
battle
must
be
round
the
verandah
at
the
other
end
the
two
passed
the
shrubbery
where
the
road
forked
one
path
running
to
the
back
door
and
one
to
the
stables
they
took
the
latter
and
presently
came
out
on
the
downs
with
the
ravine
of
the
garple
on
their
left
the
stables
in
front
and
on
the
right
the
hollow
of
a
formal
garden
running
along
the
west
side
of
the
house
the
gale
was
so
fierce
now
that
they
had
no
between
them
and
the
ocean
that
morran
could
wrestle
with
it
no
longer
and
found
shelter
in
the
lee
of
a
clump
of
rhododendrons
darkness
had
all
but
fallen
and
the
house
was
a
black
shadow
against
the
dusky
sky
while
a
confused
greyness
marked
the
sea
the
old
tower
showed
a
tooth
of
masonry
there
was
no
glow
from
it
so
the
fire
which
jaikie
had
reported
must
have
died
down
a
whaup
cried
loudly
and
very
eerily
then
another
the
birds
stirred
up
morran
that
the
laddies
patrol
she
gasped
count
the
cries
dickson
another
bird
wailed
this
time
very
near
then
there
was
perhaps
three
minutes
silence
till
a
fainter
wheeple
came
from
the
direction
of
the
tower
four
said
dickson
but
he
waited
in
vain
on
the
fifth
he
had
not
the
acute
hearing
of
the
boys
and
could
not
catch
the
faint
echo
of
peter
paterson
signal
beyond
the
verandah
the
next
he
heard
was
a
shrill
whistle
cutting
into
the
wind
and
then
others
in
rapid
succession
from
different
quarters
and
something
which
might
have
been
the
hoarse
shouting
of
angry
men
the
gorbals
had
gone
into
action
dull
prose
is
no
medium
to
tell
of
that
wild
adventure
the
sober
sequence
of
the
military
historian
is
out
of
place
in
recording
deeds
that
knew
not
sequence
or
sobriety
were
i
a
bard
i
would
cast
this
tale
in
excited
verse
with
a
lilt
which
would
catch
the
speed
of
the
reality
i
would
sing
of
napoleon
not
unworthy
of
his
great
namesake
who
penetrated
to
the
very
window
of
the
ladies
bedroom
where
the
framework
had
been
driven
in
and
men
were
pouring
through
of
how
there
he
made
such
pandemonium
with
his
whistle
that
men
tumbled
back
and
ran
about
blindly
seeking
for
guidance
of
how
in
the
long
run
his
pugnacity
mastered
him
so
that
he
engaged
in
combat
with
an
unknown
figure
and
the
two
rolled
into
what
had
once
been
a
fountain
i
would
hymn
peter
paterson
who
across
tracts
of
darkness
engaged
old
bill
in
a
conversation
which
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
a
gallogate
policeman
he
pretended
to
be
making
reports
and
seeking
orders
gotten
three
o
the
deevils
sir
what
we
dae
wi
them
he
shouted
and
back
would
come
the
reply
in
a
slightly
more
genteel
voice
fall
them
to
the
rear
tamson
has
charge
of
the
prisoners
or
it
would
be
they
gotten
pistols
sir
what
the
orders
and
the
answer
would
be
stick
to
your
batons
the
guns
are
posted
on
the
knowe
so
we
need
hurry
and
over
all
the
din
there
would
be
a
perpetual
whistling
and
a
yelling
of
hands
up
i
would
sing
too
of
wee
jaikie
who
was
having
the
hour
of
his
life
his
fragile
form
moved
like
a
lizard
in
places
where
no
mortal
could
be
expected
and
he
varied
his
duties
with
impish
assaults
upon
the
persons
of
such
as
came
in
his
way
his
whistle
blew
in
a
man
ear
one
second
and
the
next
yards
away
sometimes
he
was
moved
to
song
and
unearthly
fragments
of
we
are
or
proley
tarians
arise
mingled
with
the
din
like
the
cry
of
seagulls
in
a
storm
he
saw
a
bright
light
flare
up
within
the
house
which
warned
him
not
to
enter
but
he
got
as
far
as
the
in
whose
dark
corners
he
made
havoc
indeed
he
was
almost
too
successful
for
he
created
panic
where
he
went
and
one
or
two
fired
blindly
at
the
quarter
where
he
had
last
been
heard
these
shots
were
followed
by
frenzied
prohibitions
from
spidel
and
were
not
repeated
presently
he
felt
that
aimless
surge
of
men
that
is
the
prelude
to
flight
and
heard
dobson
great
voice
roaring
in
the
hall
convinced
that
the
crisis
had
come
he
made
his
way
outside
prepared
to
harass
the
rear
of
any
retirement
tears
now
flowed
down
his
face
and
he
could
not
have
spoken
for
sobs
but
he
had
never
been
so
happy
but
chiefly
would
i
celebrate
thomas
yownie
for
it
was
he
who
brought
fear
into
the
heart
of
dobson
he
had
a
voice
of
singular
compass
and
from
the
verandah
he
made
it
echo
round
the
house
the
efforts
of
old
bill
and
peter
paterson
had
been
skilful
indeed
but
those
of
thomas
yownie
were
deadly
to
some
leader
beyond
he
shouted
news
just
about
finished
wi
his
lot
and
then
he
get
the
boats
a
furious
charge
upset
him
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
been
discovered
but
it
was
only
dobson
rushing
to
l√©on
who
was
leading
the
men
in
the
doorway
thomas
fled
to
the
far
end
of
the
verandah
and
again
lifted
up
his
voice
all
foreigners
he
shouted
except
the
man
dobson
ay
ay
ye
got
loudon
well
done
it
must
have
been
this
last
performance
which
broke
dobson
nerve
and
convinced
him
that
the
one
hope
lay
in
a
rapid
retreat
to
the
garplefoot
there
was
a
tumbling
of
men
in
the
doorway
a
muttering
of
strange
tongues
and
the
vision
of
the
innkeeper
shouting
to
l√©on
and
spidel
for
a
second
he
was
seen
in
the
faint
reflection
that
the
light
in
the
hall
cast
as
far
as
the
verandah
a
wild
figure
urging
the
retreat
with
a
pistol
clapped
to
the
head
of
those
who
were
too
confused
by
the
hurricane
of
events
to
grasp
the
situation
some
of
them
dropped
over
the
wall
but
most
huddled
like
sheep
through
the
door
on
the
west
side
a
jumble
of
struggling
mortality
thomas
yownie
staggered
at
the
success
of
his
tactics
yet
kept
his
head
and
did
his
utmost
to
confuse
the
retreat
and
the
triumphant
shouts
and
whistles
of
the
other
showed
that
they
were
not
unmindful
of
this
final
duty
the
verandah
was
empty
and
he
was
just
about
to
enter
the
house
when
through
the
west
door
came
a
figure
breathing
hard
and
bent
apparently
on
the
same
errand
thomas
prepared
for
battle
determined
that
no
straggler
of
the
enemy
should
now
wrest
from
him
victory
but
as
the
figure
came
into
the
faint
glow
at
the
doorway
he
recognised
it
as
heritage
and
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
something
which
made
his
tense
nerves
relax
away
on
the
right
came
sounds
a
thud
of
galloping
horses
on
grass
and
the
jingle
of
bridle
reins
and
the
voices
of
men
it
was
the
real
thing
at
last
it
is
a
sad
commentary
on
his
career
but
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
brief
existence
thomas
yownie
felt
charitably
disposed
towards
the
police
the
poet
since
we
left
him
blaspheming
on
the
roof
of
the
tower
had
been
having
a
crowded
hour
of
most
inglorious
life
he
had
started
to
descend
at
a
furious
pace
and
his
first
misadventure
was
that
he
stumbled
and
dropped
dickson
pistol
over
the
parapet
he
tried
to
mark
where
it
might
have
fallen
in
the
gloom
below
and
this
lost
him
precious
minutes
when
he
slithered
through
the
trap
into
the
attic
room
where
he
had
tried
to
hold
up
the
attack
he
discovered
that
it
was
full
of
smoke
which
sought
in
vain
to
escape
by
the
narrow
window
volumes
of
it
were
pouring
up
the
stairs
and
when
he
attempted
to
descend
he
found
himself
choked
and
blinded
he
rushed
gasping
to
the
window
filled
his
lungs
with
fresh
air
and
tried
again
but
he
got
no
further
than
the
first
turn
from
which
he
could
see
through
the
cloud
red
tongues
of
flame
in
the
ground
room
this
was
solemn
indeed
so
he
sought
another
way
out
he
got
on
the
roof
for
he
remembered
a
cloaked
with
ivy
which
was
built
straight
from
the
ground
and
he
thought
he
might
climb
down
it
he
found
the
chimney
and
began
the
descent
confidently
for
he
had
once
borne
a
good
reputation
at
the
montanvert
and
cortina
at
first
all
went
well
for
stones
stuck
out
at
decent
intervals
like
the
rungs
of
a
ladder
and
roots
of
ivy
supplemented
their
deficiencies
but
presently
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
masonry
had
crumbled
into
a
cave
and
left
a
gap
some
twenty
feet
high
below
it
he
could
dimly
see
a
thick
mass
of
ivy
which
would
enable
him
to
cover
the
further
forty
feet
to
the
ground
but
at
that
cave
he
stuck
most
finally
all
round
the
lime
and
stone
had
lapsed
into
debris
and
he
could
find
no
safe
foothold
worse
still
the
block
on
which
he
relied
proved
loose
and
only
by
a
dangerous
traverse
did
he
avert
disaster
there
he
hung
for
a
minute
or
two
with
a
cold
void
in
his
stomach
he
had
always
distrusted
the
handiwork
of
man
as
a
place
to
scramble
on
and
now
he
was
planted
in
the
dark
on
a
decomposing
wall
with
an
excellent
chance
of
breaking
his
neck
and
with
the
most
urgent
need
for
haste
he
could
see
the
windows
of
the
house
and
since
he
was
sheltered
from
the
gale
he
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
blows
on
woodwork
there
was
clearly
the
devil
to
pay
there
and
yet
here
he
was
helplessly
stuck
setting
his
teeth
he
started
to
ascend
again
better
the
fire
than
this
cold
breakneck
emptiness
it
took
him
the
better
part
of
half
an
hour
to
get
back
and
he
passed
through
many
moments
of
acute
fear
footholds
which
had
seemed
secure
enough
in
the
descent
now
proved
impossible
and
more
than
once
he
had
his
heart
in
his
mouth
when
a
rotten
ivy
stump
or
a
wedge
of
stone
gave
in
his
hands
and
dropped
dully
into
the
pit
of
night
leaving
him
crazily
when
at
last
he
reached
the
top
he
rolled
on
his
back
and
felt
very
sick
then
as
he
realised
his
safety
his
impatience
revived
at
all
costs
he
would
force
his
way
out
though
he
should
be
grilled
like
a
herring
the
smoke
was
less
thick
in
the
attic
and
with
his
handkerchief
wet
with
the
rain
and
bound
across
his
mouth
he
made
a
dash
for
the
ground
room
it
was
as
hot
as
a
furnace
for
everything
inflammable
in
it
seemed
to
have
caught
fire
and
the
lumber
glowed
in
piles
of
hot
ashes
but
the
floor
and
walls
were
stone
and
only
the
blazing
jambs
of
the
door
stood
between
him
and
the
outer
air
he
had
burned
himself
considerably
as
he
stumbled
downwards
and
the
pain
drove
him
to
a
wild
leap
through
the
broken
arch
where
he
miscalculated
the
distance
charred
his
shins
and
brought
down
a
fragment
of
the
lintel
on
his
head
but
the
thing
was
done
and
a
minute
later
he
was
rolling
like
a
dog
in
the
wet
bracken
to
cool
his
burns
and
put
out
various
smouldering
patches
on
his
raiment
then
he
started
running
for
the
house
but
confused
by
the
darkness
he
bore
too
much
to
the
north
and
came
out
in
the
side
avenue
from
which
he
and
dickson
had
reconnoitred
on
the
first
evening
he
saw
on
the
right
a
glow
in
the
verandah
which
as
we
know
was
the
reflection
of
the
flare
in
the
hall
and
he
heard
a
babble
of
voices
but
he
heard
something
more
for
away
on
his
left
was
the
sound
which
thomas
yownie
was
soon
to
hear
the
trampling
of
horses
it
was
the
police
at
last
and
his
task
was
to
guide
them
at
once
to
the
critical
point
of
action
three
minutes
later
a
figure
like
a
scarecrow
was
admonishing
a
bewildered
sergeant
while
his
hands
plucked
feverishly
at
a
bridle
it
is
time
to
return
to
dickson
in
his
clump
of
rhododendrons
tragically
aware
of
his
impotence
he
listened
to
the
tumult
of
the
hopeful
when
it
was
loud
despairing
when
there
came
a
moment
lull
while
morran
like
a
greek
chorus
drew
loudly
upon
her
store
of
proverbial
philosophy
and
her
memory
of
scripture
texts
twice
he
tried
to
reconnoitre
towards
the
scene
of
battle
but
only
blundered
into
sunken
plots
and
pits
in
the
dutch
garden
finally
he
squatted
beside
morran
lit
his
pipe
and
took
a
firm
hold
on
his
patience
it
was
not
tested
for
long
presently
he
was
aware
that
a
change
had
come
over
the
scene
that
the
whistles
and
shouts
were
being
drowned
in
another
sound
the
cries
of
panicky
men
dobson
bellow
was
wafted
to
him
auntie
phemie
he
shouted
the
innkeeper
getting
rattled
dod
i
believe
they
running
for
at
that
moment
twenty
paces
on
his
left
the
van
of
the
retreat
crashed
through
the
creepers
on
the
garden
edge
and
leaped
the
wall
that
separated
it
from
the
cliffs
of
the
garplefoot
the
old
woman
was
on
her
feet
god
be
thankit
the
polis
maybe
maybe
no
but
they
running
another
bunch
of
men
raced
past
and
he
heard
dobson
voice
i
tell
you
they
broke
listen
it
horses
ay
it
the
police
but
it
was
the
that
did
the
job
here
they
must
escape
have
the
police
had
the
sense
to
send
men
to
the
garplefoot
morran
a
figure
like
an
ancient
prophetess
with
her
tartan
shawl
lashing
in
the
gale
clutched
him
by
the
shoulder
doun
to
the
waterside
and
stop
them
ye
no
be
beat
by
wee
laddies
on
wi
ye
and
i
follow
there
gaun
to
be
a
juidgment
on
this
nicht
dickson
needed
no
urging
his
heart
was
hot
within
him
and
the
weariness
and
stiffness
had
gone
from
his
limbs
he
too
tumbled
over
the
wall
and
made
for
what
he
thought
was
the
route
by
which
he
had
originally
ascended
from
the
stream
as
he
ran
he
made
ridiculous
efforts
to
cry
like
a
whaup
in
the
hope
of
summoning
the
one
indeed
he
found
napoleon
who
had
suffered
a
grievous
pounding
in
the
fountain
and
had
only
escaped
by
an
agility
which
had
aforetime
served
him
in
good
stead
with
the
law
of
his
native
city
lucky
for
dickson
was
the
meeting
for
he
had
forgotten
the
road
and
would
certainly
have
broken
his
neck
led
by
the
he
slid
forty
feet
over
screes
and
with
the
gale
plucking
at
him
found
a
path
lost
it
and
then
tumbled
down
a
raw
bank
of
earth
to
the
flat
ground
beside
the
harbour
during
all
this
performance
he
has
told
me
he
had
no
thought
of
fear
nor
any
clear
notion
what
he
meant
to
do
he
just
wanted
to
be
in
at
the
finish
of
the
job
through
the
narrow
entrance
the
gale
blew
as
through
a
funnel
and
the
usually
placid
waters
of
the
harbour
were
a
mass
of
angry
waves
two
boats
had
been
launched
and
were
plunging
furiously
and
on
one
of
them
a
lantern
dipped
and
fell
by
its
light
he
could
see
men
holding
a
further
boat
by
the
shore
there
was
no
sign
of
the
police
he
reflected
that
probably
they
had
become
tangled
in
the
garple
dean
the
third
boat
was
waiting
for
some
one
dickson
a
new
ajax
by
the
ships
divined
who
this
some
one
must
be
and
realised
his
duty
it
was
the
leader
the
the
man
whose
escape
must
at
all
costs
be
stopped
perhaps
he
had
the
princess
with
him
thus
snatching
victory
from
apparent
defeat
in
any
case
he
must
be
tackled
and
a
fierce
anxiety
gripped
his
heart
aye
finish
a
job
he
told
himself
and
peered
up
into
the
darkness
of
the
cliffs
wondering
just
how
he
should
set
about
it
for
except
in
the
last
few
days
he
had
never
engaged
in
combat
with
a
when
he
comes
you
grip
his
legs
he
told
napoleon
and
get
him
down
he
have
a
pistol
and
we
done
if
he
on
his
feet
there
was
a
cry
from
the
boats
a
shout
of
guidance
and
the
light
on
the
water
was
waved
madly
they
must
have
good
eyesight
thought
dickson
for
he
could
see
nothing
and
then
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
steps
in
front
of
him
and
a
shape
like
a
man
rising
out
of
the
void
at
his
left
hand
in
the
darkness
napoleon
missed
his
tackle
and
the
full
shock
came
on
dickson
he
aimed
at
what
he
thought
was
the
enemy
throat
found
only
an
arm
and
was
shaken
off
as
a
mastiff
might
shake
off
a
toy
terrier
he
made
another
clutch
fell
and
in
falling
caught
his
opponent
leg
so
that
he
brought
him
down
the
man
was
immensely
agile
for
he
was
up
in
a
second
and
something
hot
and
bright
blew
into
dickson
face
the
pistol
bullet
had
passed
through
the
collar
of
his
faithful
waterproof
slightly
singeing
his
neck
but
it
served
its
purpose
for
dickson
paused
gasping
to
consider
where
he
had
been
hit
and
before
he
could
resume
the
chase
the
last
boat
had
pushed
off
into
deep
water
to
be
shot
at
from
close
quarters
is
always
irritating
and
the
novelty
of
the
experience
increased
dickson
natural
wrath
he
fumed
on
the
shore
like
a
deerhound
when
the
stag
has
taken
to
the
sea
so
hot
was
his
blood
that
he
would
have
cheerfully
assaulted
the
whole
crew
had
they
been
within
his
reach
napoleon
who
had
been
incapacitated
for
speed
by
having
his
stomach
and
bare
shanks
savagely
trampled
upon
joined
him
and
together
they
watched
the
bobbing
black
specks
as
they
crawled
out
of
the
estuary
into
the
grey
spindrift
which
marked
the
harbour
mouth
but
as
he
looked
the
wrath
died
out
of
dickson
soul
for
he
saw
that
the
boats
had
indeed
sailed
on
a
desperate
venture
and
that
a
pursuer
was
on
their
track
more
potent
than
his
breathless
the
tide
was
on
the
ebb
and
the
gale
was
driving
the
atlantic
breakers
shoreward
and
in
the
jaws
of
the
entrance
the
two
waters
met
in
an
unearthly
turmoil
above
the
noise
of
the
wind
came
the
roar
of
the
flooded
garple
and
the
fret
of
the
harbour
and
far
beyond
all
the
crashing
thunder
of
the
conflict
at
the
harbour
mouth
even
in
the
darkness
against
the
still
faintly
grey
western
sky
the
spume
could
be
seen
rising
like
waterspouts
but
it
was
the
ear
rather
than
the
eye
which
made
certain
presage
of
disaster
no
boat
could
face
the
challenge
of
that
loud
portal
as
dickson
struggled
against
the
wind
and
stared
his
heart
melted
and
a
great
awe
fell
upon
him
he
may
have
wept
it
is
certain
that
he
prayed
poor
souls
poor
souls
he
repeated
i
doubt
the
last
hour
or
two
has
been
a
poor
preparation
for
eternity
the
tide
next
day
brought
the
dead
ashore
among
them
was
a
young
man
different
in
dress
and
appearance
from
the
rest
a
young
man
with
a
noble
head
and
a
classic
face
which
was
not
marred
like
the
others
from
pounding
among
the
garple
rocks
his
dark
hair
was
washed
back
from
his
brow
and
the
mouth
which
had
been
hard
in
life
was
now
relaxed
in
the
strange
innocence
of
death
dickson
gazed
at
the
body
and
observed
that
there
was
a
slight
deformation
between
the
shoulders
poor
fellow
he
said
that
explains
a
lot
as
my
father
used
to
say
cripples
have
a
right
to
be
cankered
chapter
xvi
in
which
a
princess
leaves
a
dark
tower
and
a
provision
merchant
returns
to
his
family
the
three
days
of
storm
ended
in
the
night
and
with
the
wild
weather
there
departed
from
the
cruives
something
which
had
weighed
on
spirits
since
he
first
saw
the
place
monday
only
a
week
from
the
morning
when
he
had
conceived
his
plan
of
holiday
saw
the
return
of
the
sun
and
the
bland
airs
of
spring
beyond
the
blue
of
the
yet
restless
waters
rose
dim
mountains
tipped
with
snow
like
some
mediterranean
seascape
nesting
birds
were
busy
on
the
laver
banks
and
in
the
huntingtower
thickets
the
village
smoked
peacefully
to
the
clear
skies
even
the
house
looked
cheerful
if
dishevelled
the
garple
dean
was
a
garden
of
swaying
larches
linnets
and
wild
anemones
assuredly
thought
dickson
there
had
come
a
mighty
change
in
the
countryside
and
he
meditated
a
future
discourse
to
the
literary
society
of
the
guthrie
memorial
kirk
on
natural
beauty
in
relation
to
the
mind
of
man
it
remains
for
the
chronicler
to
gather
up
the
loose
ends
of
his
tale
there
was
no
newspaper
story
with
bold
headlines
of
this
the
most
recent
assault
on
the
shores
of
britain
alexis
nicolaevitch
once
a
prince
of
muscovy
and
now
alexander
nicholson
of
the
rising
firm
of
sprot
and
nicholson
of
melbourne
had
interest
enough
to
prevent
it
for
it
was
clear
that
if
saskia
was
to
be
saved
from
persecution
her
enemies
must
disappear
without
trace
from
the
world
and
no
story
be
told
of
the
wild
venture
which
was
their
undoing
the
constabulary
of
carrick
and
scotland
yard
were
indisposed
to
ask
questions
under
a
hint
from
their
superiors
the
more
so
as
no
serious
damage
had
been
done
to
the
persons
of
his
majesty
lieges
and
no
lives
had
been
lost
except
by
the
violence
of
nature
the
investigated
the
case
of
the
drowned
men
and
reported
that
so
many
foreign
sailors
names
and
origins
unknown
had
perished
in
attempting
to
return
to
their
ship
at
the
garplefoot
the
danish
brig
had
vanished
into
the
mist
of
the
northern
seas
but
one
signal
calamity
the
had
to
record
the
body
of
loudon
the
factor
was
found
on
the
monday
morning
below
the
cliffs
his
neck
broken
by
a
fall
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
he
must
have
tried
to
escape
in
that
direction
and
he
had
chosen
an
impracticable
road
or
had
slipped
on
the
edge
it
was
returned
as
death
by
misadventure
and
the
and
the
excelled
themselves
in
eulogy
loudon
they
said
had
been
widely
known
in
the
of
scotland
as
an
able
and
trusted
lawyer
an
assiduous
public
servant
and
not
least
as
a
good
sportsman
it
was
the
last
trait
which
had
led
to
his
death
for
in
his
enthusiasm
for
wild
nature
he
had
been
studying
bird
life
on
the
cliffs
of
the
cruives
during
the
storm
and
had
made
that
fatal
slip
which
had
deprived
the
shire
of
a
wise
counsellor
and
the
best
of
good
fellows
the
tinklers
of
the
garplefoot
took
themselves
off
and
where
they
may
now
be
pursuing
their
devious
courses
is
unknown
to
the
chronicler
dobson
too
disappeared
for
he
was
not
among
the
dead
from
the
boats
he
knew
the
neighbourhood
and
probably
made
his
way
to
some
port
from
which
he
took
passage
to
one
or
other
of
those
foreign
lands
which
had
formerly
been
honoured
by
his
patronage
nor
did
all
the
russians
perish
three
were
found
skulking
next
morning
in
the
woods
starving
and
ignorant
of
any
tongue
but
their
own
and
five
more
came
ashore
much
battered
but
alive
alexis
took
charge
of
the
eight
survivors
and
arranged
to
pay
their
passage
to
one
of
the
british
dominions
and
to
give
them
a
start
in
a
new
life
they
were
broken
creatures
with
the
dazed
look
of
lost
animals
and
four
of
them
had
been
peasants
on
saskia
estates
alexis
spoke
to
them
in
their
own
language
in
my
grandfather
time
he
said
you
were
serfs
then
there
came
a
change
and
for
some
time
you
were
free
men
now
you
have
slipped
back
into
being
slaves
again
the
worst
of
slaveries
for
you
have
been
the
serfs
of
fools
and
scoundrels
and
the
black
passion
of
your
own
hearts
i
give
you
a
chance
of
becoming
free
men
once
more
you
have
the
task
before
you
of
working
out
your
own
salvation
go
and
god
be
with
you
before
we
take
leave
of
these
companions
of
a
single
week
i
would
present
them
to
you
again
as
they
appeared
on
a
certain
sunny
afternoon
when
the
episode
of
huntingtower
was
on
the
eve
of
closing
first
we
see
saskia
and
alexis
walking
on
the
thymy
sward
of
the
looking
out
to
the
fretted
blue
of
the
sea
it
is
a
fitting
place
for
lovers
above
all
for
lovers
who
have
turned
the
page
on
a
dark
preface
and
have
before
them
still
the
long
bright
volume
of
life
the
girl
has
her
arm
linked
with
the
man
but
as
they
walk
she
breaks
often
away
from
him
to
dart
into
copses
to
gather
flowers
or
to
peer
over
the
brink
where
the
gulls
wheel
and
pipe
among
the
shingle
she
is
no
more
the
tragic
muse
of
the
past
week
but
a
laughing
child
again
full
of
snatches
of
song
her
eyes
bright
with
expectation
they
talk
of
the
new
world
which
lies
before
them
and
her
voice
is
happy
then
her
brows
contract
and
as
she
flings
herself
down
on
a
patch
of
young
heather
her
air
is
thoughtful
i
have
been
back
among
fairy
tales
she
says
i
do
not
quite
understand
alesha
those
gallant
little
boys
they
are
youth
and
youth
is
always
full
of
strangeness
heritage
he
is
youth
too
and
poetry
perhaps
and
a
soldier
tradition
i
think
i
know
him
but
what
about
dickson
he
is
the
the
the
class
which
the
world
ridicules
he
is
unbelievable
the
others
with
good
fortune
i
might
find
elsewhere
in
russia
perhaps
but
not
dickson
no
is
the
answer
you
will
not
find
him
in
russia
he
is
what
we
call
the
which
we
who
were
foolish
used
to
laugh
at
but
he
is
the
stuff
which
above
all
others
makes
a
great
people
he
will
endure
when
aristocracies
crack
and
proletariats
crumble
in
our
own
land
we
have
never
known
him
but
till
we
create
him
our
land
will
not
be
a
nation
half
a
mile
away
on
the
edge
of
the
laver
glen
dickson
and
heritage
are
together
dickson
placidly
smoking
on
a
and
heritage
walking
excitedly
about
and
cutting
with
his
stick
at
the
bracken
sundry
bandages
and
strips
of
sticking
plaster
still
adorn
the
poet
but
his
clothes
have
been
tidied
up
by
morran
and
he
has
recovered
something
of
his
old
precision
of
garb
the
eyes
of
both
are
fixed
on
the
two
figures
on
the
dickson
feels
acutely
uneasy
it
is
the
first
time
that
he
has
been
alone
with
heritage
since
the
arrival
of
alexis
shivered
the
poet
dream
he
looks
to
see
a
tragic
grief
to
his
amazement
he
beholds
something
very
like
exultation
the
trouble
about
you
dogson
says
heritage
is
that
you
a
bit
of
an
anarchist
all
you
false
romantics
are
you
do
see
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
conventions
which
time
has
consecrated
you
always
want
novelty
you
know
and
the
novel
is
usually
the
ugly
and
rarely
the
true
i
am
for
romance
but
upon
the
old
noble
classic
lines
dickson
is
scarcely
listening
his
eyes
are
on
the
distant
lovers
and
he
longs
to
say
something
which
will
gently
and
graciously
express
his
sympathy
with
his
friend
i
afraid
he
begins
hesitatingly
i
afraid
you
had
a
bad
blow
heritage
you
taking
it
awful
well
and
i
honour
you
for
it
the
poet
flings
back
his
head
i
am
reconciled
he
says
after
all
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
never
to
have
loved
at
all
it
has
been
a
great
experience
and
has
shown
me
my
own
heart
i
love
her
i
shall
always
love
her
but
i
realise
that
she
was
never
meant
for
me
thank
god
i
been
able
to
serve
her
that
is
all
a
moth
can
ask
of
a
star
i
a
better
man
for
it
dogson
she
will
be
a
glorious
memory
and
lord
what
poetry
i
shall
write
i
give
her
up
joyfully
for
she
has
found
her
true
mate
us
not
to
the
marriage
of
true
minds
admit
impediments
the
thing
too
perfect
to
grieve
about
look
there
is
romance
incarnate
he
points
to
the
figures
now
silhouetted
against
the
further
sea
how
does
it
go
dogson
he
cries
on
her
lover
arm
she
leant
what
next
you
know
the
thing
dickson
assists
and
heritage
declaims
and
on
her
lover
arm
she
leant
and
round
her
waist
she
felt
it
fold
and
far
across
the
hills
they
went
in
that
new
world
which
is
the
old
across
the
hills
and
far
away
beyond
their
utmost
purple
rim
and
deep
into
the
dying
day
the
happy
princess
followed
him
he
repeats
the
last
two
lines
twice
and
draws
a
deep
breath
how
right
he
cries
how
absolutely
right
lord
it
astonishing
how
that
old
bird
tennyson
got
the
goods
after
that
dickson
leaves
him
and
wanders
among
the
thickets
on
the
edge
of
the
huntingtower
policies
above
the
laver
glen
he
feels
childishly
happy
wonderfully
young
and
at
the
same
time
supernaturally
wise
sometimes
he
thinks
the
past
week
has
been
a
dream
till
he
touches
the
on
his
brow
and
finds
that
his
left
thigh
is
still
a
mass
of
bruises
and
that
his
right
leg
is
wofully
stiff
with
that
the
past
becomes
very
real
again
and
he
sees
the
garple
dean
in
that
stormy
afternoon
he
wrestles
again
at
midnight
in
the
dark
house
he
stands
with
quaking
heart
by
the
boats
to
cut
off
the
retreat
he
sees
it
all
but
without
terror
in
the
recollection
rather
with
gusto
and
a
modest
pride
i
surely
had
a
remarkable
time
he
tells
himself
and
then
romance
the
goddess
whom
he
has
worshipped
so
long
marries
that
furious
week
with
the
idyllic
he
is
supremely
content
for
he
knows
that
in
his
humble
way
he
has
not
been
found
wanting
once
more
for
him
the
chavender
or
chub
and
long
dreams
among
summer
hills
his
mind
flies
to
the
days
ahead
of
him
when
he
will
go
wandering
with
his
pack
in
many
green
places
happy
days
they
will
be
the
prospect
with
which
he
has
always
charmed
his
mind
yes
but
they
will
be
different
from
what
he
had
fancied
for
he
is
another
man
than
the
complacent
little
fellow
who
set
out
a
week
ago
on
his
travels
he
has
now
assurance
of
himself
assurance
of
his
faith
romance
he
sees
is
one
and
indivisible
below
him
by
the
edge
of
the
stream
he
sees
the
encampment
of
the
gorbals
he
calls
and
waves
a
hand
and
his
signal
is
answered
it
seems
to
be
washing
day
for
some
scanty
and
tattered
raiment
is
drying
on
the
sward
the
band
is
evidently
in
session
for
it
is
sitting
in
a
circle
deep
in
talk
as
he
looks
at
the
ancient
tents
the
humble
equipment
the
ring
of
small
shockheads
a
great
tenderness
comes
over
him
the
are
so
tiny
so
poor
so
pitifully
handicapped
and
yet
so
bold
in
their
meagreness
not
one
of
them
has
had
anything
that
might
be
called
a
chance
their
few
years
have
been
spent
in
kennels
and
closes
always
hungry
and
hunted
with
none
to
care
for
them
their
childish
ears
have
been
habituated
to
every
coarseness
their
small
minds
filled
with
the
desperate
shifts
of
living
and
yet
what
a
heavenly
spark
was
in
them
he
had
always
thought
nobly
of
the
soul
now
he
wants
to
get
on
his
knees
before
the
queer
greatness
of
humanity
a
figure
disengages
itself
from
the
group
and
dougal
makes
his
way
up
the
hill
towards
him
the
chieftain
is
not
more
reputable
in
garb
than
when
we
first
saw
him
nor
is
he
more
cheerful
of
countenance
he
has
one
arm
in
a
sling
made
out
of
his
neckerchief
and
his
scraggy
little
throat
rises
bare
from
his
voluminous
shirt
all
that
can
be
said
for
him
is
that
he
is
appreciably
cleaner
he
comes
to
a
standstill
and
salutes
with
a
special
formality
dougal
says
dickson
i
been
thinking
you
the
grandest
lot
of
wee
laddies
i
ever
heard
tell
of

forbye

on
in
years

dead
old

not
a
poor
man
and
i
have
chick
or
child
to
look
after
none
of
you

had
a
proper
chance

one
thing

and
prime
ministers
and
dod

my
blame
if

get
out
dougal
listens
gravely
and
again
salutes
i
brought
ye
a
message
he
says
we
just
had
a
meetin
and
to
report
that
ye
been
unanimously
eleckit
chief
we
hopin
ye
accept
i
accept
dickson
replies
proudly
and
gratefully
i
accept
the
last
scene
is
some
days
later
in
a
certain
southern
suburb
of
glasgow
ulysses
has
come
back
to
ithaca
and
is
sitting
by
his
fireside
waiting
on
the
return
of
penelope
from
the
neuk
hydropathic
there
is
a
chill
in
the
air
so
a
fire
is
burning
in
the
grate
but
the
laden
is
bright
with
the
first
blooms
of
lilac
dickson
in
a
new
suit
with
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
looks
none
the
worse
for
his
travels
save
that
there
is
still
on
his
deeply
sunburnt
brow
he
waits
impatiently
with
his
eye
on
the
black
marble
timepiece
and
he
fingers
something
in
his
pocket
presently
the
sound
of
wheels
is
heard
and
the
peahen
voice
of
tibby
announces
the
arrival
of
penelope
dickson
rushes
to
the
door
and
at
the
threshold
welcomes
his
wife
with
a
resounding
kiss
he
leads
her
into
the
parlour
and
settles
her
in
her
own
chair
my
but
it
nice
to
be
home
again
she
says
and
everything
that
comfortable
i
had
a
fine
time
but
there
no
place
like
your
own
fireside
you
looking
awful
well
dickson
but
losh
what
have
you
been
doing
to
your
head
just
a
small
tumble
it
very
near
mended
already
ay
i
had
a
grand
walking
tour
but
the
weather
was
a
wee
bit
thrawn
it
nice
to
see
you
back
again
mamma
now
that
i
an
idle
man
you
and
me
must
take
a
lot
of
jaunts
together
she
beams
on
him
as
she
stays
herself
with
tibby
scones
and
when
the
meal
is
ended
dickson
draws
from
his
pocket
a
slim
case
the
jewels
have
been
restored
to
saskia
but
this
is
one
of
her
own
which
she
has
bestowed
upon
dickson
as
a
parting
memento
he
opens
the
case
and
reveals
a
necklet
of
emeralds
any
one
of
which
is
worth
half
the
street
this
is
a
present
for
you
he
says
bashfully
mccunn
eyes
open
wide
you
far
too
kind
she
gasps
it
must
have
cost
an
awful
lot
of
money
it
did
cost
me
that
much
is
the
truthful
answer
she
fingers
the
trinket
and
then
clasps
it
round
her
neck
where
the
green
depths
of
the
stones
glow
against
the
black
satin
of
her
bodice
her
eyes
are
moist
as
she
looks
at
him
you
been
a
kind
man
to
me
she
says
and
she
kisses
him
as
she
has
not
done
since
janet
death
she
stands
up
and
admires
the
necklet
in
the
mirror
romance
once
more
thinks
dickson
that
which
has
graced
the
slim
throats
of
princesses
in
courts
now
adorns
an
elderly
matron
in
a
villa
the
jewels
of
the
wild
nausicaa
have
fallen
to
the
housewife
penelope
mccunn
preens
herself
before
the
glass
i
call
it
very
genteel
she
says
real
stylish
it
might
be
worn
by
a
queen
i
would
say
but
it
has
says
dickson
the
end
