appeared
in

columns
of
frederick
paper
rochester
and
the
aliened
american
published
and
edited
by
william
howard
day
at
cleveland
ohio
which
continued
in
those
papers
every
issue
until
the
meeting
of
the
convention
call
for
a
national
emigration
convention
of
colored
men
be
held
in
cleveland
ohio
on
the
and
of
august
men
and
brethren
the
time
has
fully
come
when
we
as
an
oppressed
people
should
do
something
effectively
and
use
those
means
adequate
to
the
attainment
of
the
great
and
long
desired
end
do
something
to
meet
the
actual
demands
of
the
present
and
prospective
necessities
of
the
rising
generation
of
our
people
in
this
country
to
do
this
we
must
occupy
a
position
of
entire
of
rights
composing
in
fact
an
acknowledged
part
of
the
of
society
in
which
we
live
the
policy
to
the
of
this
must
be
our
if
ever
we
expect
the
enjoyment
freedom
sovereignty
and
equality
of
rights
anywhere
for
this
purpose
and
to
this
end
then
all
colored
men
in
favor
of
emigration
out
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
american
colonization
scheme
of
leaving
the
western
hemisphere
are
requested
to
meet
in
cleveland
ohio
tuesday
the
day
of
august
in
a
great
national
convention
then
and
there
to
consider
and
decide
upon
the
great
and
important
subject
of
emigration
from
the
united
states
no
person
will
be
admitted
to
a
seat
in
the
convention
who
would
introduce
the
subject
of
emigration
to
the
eastern
hemisphere
either
to
asia
africa
or
europe
as
our
object
and
determination
are
to
consider
our
claims
to
the
west
indies
central
and
south
america
and
the
canadas
this
restriction
has
no
reference
to
preference
or
enterprise
but
to
the
great
question
of
national
claims
to
come
before
the
convention
all
persons
coming
to
the
convention
must
bring
credentials
properly
authenticated
or
bring
verbal
assurance
to
the
committee
on
credentials
appointed
for
the
purpose
of
their
fidelity
to
the
measures
and
objects
set
forth
in
this
call
as
the
convention
is
specifically
by
and
for
the
friends
of
emigration
and
none
others
and
no
opposition
to
them
will
be
entertained
the
question
is
not
whether
our
condition
can
be
bettered
by
emigration
but
whether
it
can
be
made
worse
if
not
then
there
is
no
part
of
the
wide
spread
universe
where
our
social
and
political
condition
are
not
better
than
here
in
our
native
country
and
nowhere
in
the
world
as
here
proscribed
on
account
of
color
we
are
friends
to
and
ever
will
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
by
our
brethren
and
all
our
friends
in
all
good
measures
adopted
by
them
for
the
bettering
of
our
condition
in
this
country
and
surrender
no
rights
but
with
our
last
breath
but
as
the
subject
of
emigration
is
of
vital
importance
and
has
ever
been
shunned
by
all
delegated
assemblages
of
our
people
as
heretofore
met
we
can
not
longer
delay
and
will
not
be
farther
baffled
and
deny
the
right
of
our
most
sanguine
friend
or
dearest
brother
to
prevent
an
intelligent
inquiry
into
and
the
carrying
out
of
these
measures
when
this
can
be
done
to
our
entire
advantage
as
we
propose
to
show
in
convention
as
the
west
indies
central
and
south
america
the
majority
of
which
are
peopled
our
brethren
or
those
identified
with
us
in
race
and
what
is
more
on
this
continent
all
stand
with
open
arms
and
yearning
hearts
importuning
us
in
the
name
of
suffering
humanity
to
come
to
make
common
cause
and
share
one
common
fate
on
the
continent
the
convention
will
meet
without
fail
at
the
time
fixed
for
assembling
as
none
but
those
favorable
to
emigration
are
admissible
therefore
no
other
gathering
may
prevent
it
the
number
of
delegates
will
not
be
restricted
except
in
the
town
where
the
convention
may
be
held
and
there
the
number
will
be
decided
by
the
convention
when
assembled
that
they
may
not
too
far
exceed
the
other
delegations
the
time
and
place
fixed
for
holding
the
conventions
are
ample
affording
sufficient
time
and
a
leisure
season
generally
and
as
cleveland
is
now
the
centre
of
all
directions
a
good
and
favorable
opportunity
to
all
who
desire
to
attend
therefore
it
may
reasonably
be
the
greatest
gathering
of
the
colored
people
ever
before
assembled
in
a
convention
in
the
united
states
colonizationists
are
advised
that
no
favors
will
be
shown
to
them
or
their
expatriating
scheme
as
we
have
no
sympathy
with
the
enemies
of
our
race
all
colored
men
east
west
north
and
south
favorable
to
the
measures
set
forth
in
this
call
will
send
in
their
names
to
delany
or
rev
wm
webb
pittsburgh
that
there
may
be
arranged
and
attached
to
the
call
names
from
each
state
we
must
make
an
issue
create
an
event
and
establish
a
position
it
is
glorious
to
think
of
but
far
more
glorious
to
carry
out

iii
history
of
the
project
in
the
winter
of
being
then
but
a
youth
i
formed
the
design
of
going
to
africa
the
land
of
my
ancestry
when
in
the
succeeding
winter
of
having
then
fully
commenced
to
study
i
entered
into
a
solemn
promise
with
the
rev
molliston
madison
clark
then
a
student
in
jefferson
college
at
cannonsburg
washington
county
pennsylvania
being
but
seventeen
miles
from
pittsburgh
where
i
resided
his
vacations
being
spent
in
the
latter
place
to
complete
an
education
and
go
on
an
independent
and
voluntary
mission
to
travel
in
africa
i
as
a
physician
and
he
as
a
clergyman
for
which
he
was
then
preparing
during
these
vacations
of
about
seven
weeks
each
clark
was
of
great
advantage
to
me
in
my
studies
he
being
then
a
man
of
probably
thirty
years
of
age
or
more
and
in
his
senior
year
i
think
at
college
this
design
i
never
abandoned
although
in
common
with
my
race
in
america
i
espoused
the
cause
and
contended
for
our
political
and
moral
elevation
on
equality
with
the
whites
believing
then
as
i
do
now
that
merit
alone
should
be
the
test
of
individual
claims
in
the
body
politic
this
cause
i
never
have
nor
will
abandon
believing
that
no
man
should
hesitate
or
put
off
any
duty
for
another
time
or
place
but
act
act
in
the
act
or
this
has
been
the
rule
of
my
life
and
i
hope
ever
shall
be
in
i
had
fully
matured
a
plan
for
an
adventure
and
to
a
number
of
select
intelligent
gentlemen
of
african
descent
of
course
fully
committed
myself
in
favor
of
it
they
all
agreed
that
the
scheme
was
good
and
although
neither
of
them
entered
personally
into
it
all
fully
sanctioned
it
bidding
me
in
my
new
adventure
as
a
powerful
handmaid
to
their
efforts
in
contending
for
our
rights
in
america
in
at
the
great
emigration
convention
in
cleveland
my
paper
read
and
adopted
as
a
report
on
the
political
destiny
of
the
colored
race
on
the
american
continent
set
forth
fully
my
views
on
the
advantages
of
emigration
although
the
call
itself
strictly
prohibits
the
introduction
of
the
question
of
emigration
from
the
american
continent
or
western
hemisphere
the
qualification
which
directly
follows
this
restriction
has
no
reference
to
preference
or
enterprise
may
readily
be
understood
it
was
a
mere
policy
on
the
part
of
the
authors
of
those
documents
to
confine
their
scheme
to
america
including
the
west
indies
whilst
they
were
the
leading
advocates
of
the
regeneration
of
africa
lest
they
compromised
themselves
and
their
people
to
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
race
the
convention
at
cleveland
in
its
secret
sessions
made
africa
with
its
rich
inexhaustible
productions
and
great
facilities
for
checking
the
abominable
slave
trade
its
most
important
point
of
dependence
though
each
individual
was
left
to
take
the
direction
which
in
his
judgment
best
suited
him
though
our
great
gun
was
leveled
and
the
first
shell
thrown
at
the
american
continent
driving
a
slaveholding
faction
into
despair
and
a
political
confusion
from
which
they
have
been
utterly
unable
to
extricate
themselves
but
become
more
and
more
complicated
every
year
was
held
in
reserve
until
by
the
help
of
an
providence
we
could
effect
what
has
just
been
accomplished
with
signal
a
work
which
the
most
sanguine
friend
of
the
cause
believed
would
require
at
least
the
half
of
a
century
it
is
a
curious
and
not
less
singular
historical
fact
that
a
leading
political
journal
and
the
first
newspaper
which
nominated
james
buchanan
many
years
ago
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
and
at
a
time
whilst
he
was
yet
at
the
court
of
james
as
envoy
extraordinary
this
paper
was
strongly
urging
his
claims
as
such
thus
expresses
itself
which
gives
a
fair
idea
of
the
political
press
generally
especially
in
pennsylvania
buchanan
native
state
i
intended
to
give
the
article
entire
as
alarm
will
be
seen
even
at
the
commencement
but
pressure
for
space
will
prevent
my
quoting
but
a
few
sentences
it
is
from
the
pittsburgh
morning
wednesday
october
a
grand
scheme
for
the
colored
race
in
august
last
a
national
convention
of
colored
people
was
held
at
cleveland
ohio
it
was
composed
of
delegates
from
most
of
the
states
it
was
called
the
emigration
convention
and
its
objects
were
to
consider
the
political
destinies
of
the
black
race
and
recommend
a
plan
of
emigration
to
countries
where
they
can
enjoy
political
liberty
and
form
nations
and
independent
the
committee
then
proceeds
to
mark
out
a
grand
scheme
by
which
the
negro
race
may
be
regenerated
and
formed
into
free
intelligent
and
prosperous
nations
the
west
india
islands
central
america
and
all
the
northern
and
middle
portions
of
south
america
including
the
whole
of
brazil
are
designated
as
the
regions
desired
and
that
can
be
obtained
as
the
seat
of
negro
civilization
and
empire
these
regions
and
islands
together
are
represented
as
containing
and
a
half
millions
of
population
but
of
which
some
three
and
a
half
millions
are
whites
of
pure
european
extraction
and
the
remainder
nearly
millions
are
colored
people
of
african
and
indian
origin
this
immense
preponderance
of
the
colored
races
in
those
regions
it
is
supposed
will
enable
them
with
the
aid
of
emigration
from
the
united
states
to
take
possession
of
all
those
countries
and
islands
and
become
the
ruling
race
in
the
empires
to
be
formed
out
of
those
wide
and
fruitful
realms
the
committee
expresses
full
confidence
in
the
practicability
of
this
great
undertaking
and
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
its
success
at
no
distant
day
but
unanimity
of
sentiment
and
action
among
the
masses
of
the
colored
people
the
climate
of
those
regions
is
represented
as
entirely
congenial
to
the
colored
race
while
to
the
european
races
it
is
enervating
and
destructive
and
this
fact
added
to
the
present
immense
superiority
of
numbers
on
the
part
of
the
negroes
is
relied
on
as
a
sure
guarantee
of
the
success
of
the
great
enterprise
and
that
their
race
could
forever
maintain
the
possession
and
control
of
those
regions
other
great
events
it
is
supposed
will
follow
in
the
train
of
this
mighty
movement
with
the
west
india
islands
and
central
and
south
america
composing
free
negro
nations
slavery
in
the
united
states
would
they
suppose
soon
be
at
an
end
the
facility
of
escape
the
near
neighborhood
of
friends
and
aid
it
is
urged
would
rapidly
drain
off
from
the
southern
states
all
the
most
intelligent
robust
and
bold
of
their
slaves
delany
of
pittsburgh
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
made
this
report
to
the
convention
it
was
of
course
adopted
if
drafted
this
report
it
certainly
does
him
much
credit
for
learning
and
ability
and
can
not
fail
to
establish
for
him
a
reputation
for
vigor
and
brilliancy
of
imagination
never
yet
surpassed
it
is
a
vast
conception
of
impossible
birth
the
committee
seem
to
have
entirely
overlooked
the
strength
of
the
on
earth
that
would
oppose
the
africanization
of
more
than
half
the
western
hemisphere
we
have
no
motive
in
noticing
this
gorgeous
dream
of
committee
except
to
show
its
fallacy
its
impracticability
in
fact
its
absurdity
no
sensible
man
whatever
his
color
should
be
for
a
moment
deceived
by
such
impracticable
theories
on
the
african
coast
already
exists
a
thriving
and
prosperous
republic
it
is
the
native
home
of
the
african
race
and
there
he
can
enjoy
the
dignity
of
manhood
the

civilization
and
freedom
every
colored
man
in
this
country
will
be
welcomed
there
as
a
free
citizen
and
there
he
can
not
only
prosper
and
secure
his
own
comfort
and
happiness
but
become
a
teacher
and
benefactor
of
his
kindred
races
and
become
an
agent
in
carrying
civilization
and
christianity
to
a
benighted
continent
that
any
one
will
be
turned
aside
from
so
noble
a
mission
by
the
delusive
dream
of
conquest
and
empire
in
the
western
hemisphere
is
an
absurdity
too
monstrous
and
mischievous

immediately
after

commenced
a
general
correspondence
with
individuals
imparting
to

the
basis
of
my
adventure
to
africa
to
obtain
intelligent
colleagues
during
this
time
the

published
giving
an
interesting
and
intelligent
account
of
that
extensive
portion
of

known
on
the
large

of
that
continent
as

still
more
encouraged
to
carry
out
my
scheme
at
this
juncture

great
work
on

made
its
appearance
which
seemed
to
have
stimulated

in
many
directions
among

from
whom
jonathan

a
very
respectable

was
delegated
as

chairman
to
counsel
me
on
the
subject
in
the
several
councils
held
between
myers
and
myself
it
was
agreed
and
understood
that
i
was
to
embody
their
cause
and
interests
in
my
mission
to
africa
they
accepting
of
the
policy
of
my
scheme
at
this
time
i
made
vigorous
efforts
to
accomplish
my
design
and
for
this
purpose
among

endeavored
to
obtain
goods
in

to
embark
for

i
think
very
highly
of
the
intended
expedition
to
the
of

niger
i
would
be
pleased
to
accompany
it
professionally
if
i
were
to
receive
a
proper
outfit
and
salary
wilson
declines
but
robert
campbell
of
the
for
colored

a
very
accomplished
chemist
says
he
will
gladly
accompany
the
expedition
if
a
proper
support
for
his
family
in
his
absence
were
assured
rev
william
douglass
in
conversation
with
me
has
expressed
very
favorable
views
hoping
you
may
be
very
successful
i
remain
in
expectation
of
receiving
more
detailed
accounts
of
the
plan
its
prospects
and
progress
your
friend
and
robert
douglass
thirteenth
up
to
this
time
i
had
never
before
known
or
heard
of
campbell
who
is
a
west
india
gentleman
native
bred
in
jamaica
but
the
recommendation
of
douglass
an
old
acquaintance
and
gentleman
of
unsullied
integrity
accompanied
as
it
was
by
the
following
note
from
wilson
also
an
accomplished
gentleman
of
equal
integrity
a
physician
surgeon
and
chemist
who
being
selected
by
me
as
surgeon
and
naturalist
of
the
party
also
recommended
campbell
in
a
detached
note
which
has
been
mislaid
was
sufficient
at
the
time
delany
philadelphia
june
dear
sir
i
received
your
note
of
may
through
the
kindness
of
douglass
and
can
truly
say
i
am
highly
gratified
to
learn
of
so
laudable
an
enterprise
and
expedition
and
would
be
happy
and
proud
to
be
numbered
with
the
noble
hearts
and
brilliant
minds
identified
with
it
yet
whilst
i
acknowledge
and
feel
myself
flattered
by
the
honor
conferred
upon
me
in
being
selected
for
so
important
and
honorable
position
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
it
will
be
wholly
out
of
my
power
to
accept
very
respectfully
james
wilson
lombard
i
have
been
the
more
induced
to
give
the
letters
of
douglass
and
wilson
in
favor
of
campbell
because
some
of
my
friends
were
disposed
to
think
that
i
went
out
of
the
way
to
make
choice
of
an
entire
stranger
unknown
to
us
instead
of
old
and
tried
acquaintances
as
they
were
pleased
to
express
it
i
had
but
one
object
in
view
the
moral
social
and
political
elevation
of
ourselves
and
the
regeneration
of
africa
for
which
i
desired
as
a
and
indeed
the
only
and
means
by
which
it
is
to
be
accomplished
men
of
african
descent
properly
qualified
and
of
pure
and
fixed
principles
these
i
endeavored
to
select
by
corresponding
only
with
such
of
my
acquaintances
at
the
council
which
appointed
me
commissioner
to
africa
having
presented
the
names
of
douglass
and
campbell
asking
that
they
also
might
be
chosen
at
a
subsequent
meeting
the
following
action
took
place
whereas
martin
delany
commissioner
to

presented
the

that

that

and
is
to

from

pecuniary
responsibility
of
sending
out
this
expedition
dated
at
the
office
of

chatham
county
of

province
of

this
thirtieth
day
of

in

year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
by
the
president
william
howard
day
isaac
shadd
george
brodie
secretary
so
soon
as
these
names
with
their
destined
mission
were
officially
published
there
arose
at
once
from
mistaken
persons
in
philadelphia
a
torrent
of
opposition
who
presuming
to
know
more
about
us
the
blacks
and
our
own
business
than
we
did
ourselves
went
even
so
far
as
to
speak
to
one
of
our
party
and
tell
him
that
we
were
for
any
such
undertaking
nor
could
be
in
years
yet
to
of
course
as
necessary
to
sustain
this
it
was
followed
up
with
a
dissertation
on
the
of
the
chief
of
the
party
mentally
and
physically
appearances
and
all
so
effectually
was
this
opposition
prosecuted
that
colored
people
in
many
directions
in
the
united
states
and
the
canadas
were
not
only
affected
by
it
but
a
party
of
three
had
already
been
chosen
and
appointed
to
supersede
us
even
without
any
knowledge
on
my
part
claims
were
made
in
england
in
behalf
of
the
niger
valley
exploring
party
solely
through
the
instrumentality
of
these
philadelphians
such
were
the
effects
of
this
that
our
preparatory
progress
was
not
only
seriously
retarded
i
having
to
spend
eight
months
in
new
york
city
to
counteract
the
influence
where
six
weeks
only
would
have
been
required
but
three
years
originally
intended
to
be
spent
in
exploring
had
to
be
reduced
to
one
and
the
number
of
commissioners
from
five
to
two
thereby
depriving
robert
douglass
from
going
an
old
friend
and
most
excellent
gentleman
whose
life
as
well
as
that
of
his
father
before
him
had
been
spent
in
efforts
not
only
of
but
the
elevation
also
of
his
people
many
years
ago
the
accomplished
articles
of
robert
douglass
jun
to
the
states
and
other
public
journals
forced
those
periodicals
to
respect
at
least
the
writer
if
not
his
race
aray
also
an
excellent
gentleman
who
had
given
up
business
to
join
the
party
was
doomed
to
disappointment
and
of
jas
purnell
who
met
me
in
new
york
two
weeks
after
my
arrival
and
through
the
whole
eight
months
of
adversity
and
doubtful
progress
stood
by
me
performing
the
duty
of
secretary
writing
in
every
direction
copying
and
from
dictation
for
hours
at
a
time
i
can
not
say
too
much
for
a
young
gentleman
inexperienced
in
such
matters
he
has
no
superior
and
for
integrity
true
heartedness
and
trustworthiness
in
my
estimation
he
has
few
if
any
rivals
to
his
great
and
good
uncle
under
whom
he
was
brought
up
much
of
his
character
is
to
be
credited
as
an
expression
of
the
feelings
of
the
most
intelligent
emigrationists
with
whom
i
corresponded
generally
in
america
i
give
below
two
extracts
from
letters
of
professor
freeman
the
professor
is
now
as
he
then
was
the
principal
of
avery
college
alleghany
city
april
my
dear
friend
your
letter
of
condolence
was
duly
received
for
which
we
tender
you
our
warmest
thanks
i
have
read
bowen
work
and
shall
purchase
livingstone
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
africa
is
the
country
to
which
all
colored
men
who
wish
to
attain
the
full
stature
of
manhood
and
bring
up
their
children
to
be
men
and
not
creeping
things
should
turn
their
steps
and
i
feel
more
and
more
every
day
that
i
made
a
great
mistake
in
not
going
there
when
i
was
untrammelled
by
family
ties
and
had
the
opportunity
respectfully
yours
freeman
again
the
professor
says
i
see
that
emigration
has
broken
out
in
the
east
and
that
can
notice
one
now
without
scoffing
at
which
he
could
not
in
well
people
can
grow
wondrously
wise
in
four
years
but
it
will
take
several
more
to
bring
the
leaders
among
us
up
to
the
old
cleveland
platform
of
all
the
fault
of
that
movement
was
this
that
it
was
at
least
one
generation
ahead
of
the
colored
heads
of
our
people
we
may
if
we
please
refuse
to
emigrate
and
crouch
like
spaniels
to
lick
the
hand
that
beats
us
but
children
children
at
the
farthest
will
have
outgrown
such
pitiful
meanness
and
will
dare
to
do
all
that
others
have
dared
and
done
for
the
sake
of
freedom
and
independence
then
all
this
cowardly
cant
about
the
unhealthy
climate
the
voracious
beasts
and
venomous
reptiles
of
africa
will
be
at
a
discount
instead
of
passing
current
as
now
for
wisdom
and
prudence
campbell
who
finally
agreed
voluntarily
to
be
one
of
the
niger
valley
exploring
party
spent
some
time
with
us
in
new
york
and
some
time
in
philadelphia
but
finally
in
consequence
of
the
doubtful
prospects
of
my
success
left
it
would
seem
at
the
suggestion
and
with
the
advice
and
recommendation
of
parties
in
philadelphia
disconnected
with
and
unknown
to
me
from
whom
he
received
letters
of
introduction
for
england
in
justice
to
myself
and
party
as
organized
as
well
as
the
great
cause
and
people
whom
i
represent
i
here
simply
remark
that
this
was
no
arrangement
of
mine
nor
our
party
as
such
at
the
time
and
whatever
of
success
the
visit
was
attended
with
and
benefit
thereby
accrued
mutually
to
us
in
africa
i
as
frankly
decline
any
authority
in
the
matter
and
credit
to
myself
as
i
should
had
the
result
proved
what
it
might
have
done
otherwise
i
am
only
willing
to
claim
that
which
is
legitimately
mine
and
be
responsible
for
my
own
doings
whether
good
or
bad
but
this
act
the
integrity
of
the
party
was
forced
to
acknowledge
as
the
following
circular
published
in
england
will
show
expedition
to
africa
to
promote
the
cultivation
of
cotton
and
other
products
of
by
emigrants
from
america
a
party
consisting
of
martin
delany
robert
campbell
purnell
robert
douglass
and
amos
aray
the
last
two
subsequently
omitted
has
been
commissioned
by
a
convention
of
colored
persons
held
at
chatham
to
proceed
to
africa
and
select
a
location
for
the
establishment
of
an
industrial
colony
while
such
an
enterprise
is
of
importance
in
the
evangelization
and
civilization
of
africa
and
in
affording
an
asylum
in
which
the
oppressed
descendants
of
that
country
may
find
the
means
of
developing
their
mental
and
moral
faculties
unimpeded
by
unjust
restrictions
it
is
regarded
as
of
still
greater
importance
in
facilitating
the
production
of
those
staples
particularly
cotton
which
now
are
supplied
to
the
world
chiefly
by
slave
labor
the
effect
of
this
would
be
to
lessen
the
profits
of
slavery
to
render
in
time
the
slave
a
burden
to
his
owner
and
thus
furnish
an
irresistible
motive
to
emancipation
africa
possesses
resources
which
properly
developed
must
doubtless
render
her
eventually
a
great
if
not
the
greatest
producer
of
all
the
products
of
slave
labor
and
how
would
all
good
men
rejoice
to
see
the
blow
which
shall
effectually
prostrate
the
giant
slavery
struck
by
the
black
man
arm
it
is
necessary
however
that
civilized
influences
be
diffused
in
her
midst
or
at
least
that
facilities
for
rendering
available
her
products
be
supplied
equal
to
the
demand
for
them
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
party
to
proceed
to
lagos
thence
through
abbeokuta
to
rabba
on
the
niger
about
miles
from
the
coast
to
study
the
agricultural
and
commercial
facilities
of
the
country
and
the
disposition
of
the
natives
towards
strangers
as
settlers
also
to
negotiate
for
the
grant
or
purchase
of
land
and
to
ascertain
the
conditions
on
which
we
might
be
protected
in
the
usages
of
civilized
life
these
objects
being
accomplished
the
party
will
return
and
report
the
result
of
their
labors
when
a
considerable
number
of
intelligent
and
enterprising
persons
from
the
united
states
and
canada
many
of
them
intimately
acquainted
with
the
production
of
cotton
and
its
preparation
for
market
will
be
prepared
to
emigrate
towards
defraying
the
expenses
of
this
undertaking
has
been
subscribed
in
america
this
amount
has
been
expended
in
providing
for

the

will
take
the
liberty
of
calling
upon
you
personally
at
an
early
day
to
solicit
your
aid
in
this
enterprise
manchester
may
robert
campbell
grant
for
charity
sake
that
it
was
done
with
the
best
of
motives
it
was
flagrantly
and
fatally
at
variance
with
every
principle
of
intelligent
to
say
nothing
of
enlightened
organizations
among
civilized
men
and
in
perfect
harmony
with
that
mischievous
interference
by
which
the
enemies
of
our
race
have
ever
sought
to
sow
discord
among
us
to
prove
a
natural
contempt
for
the
negro
and
repugnance
to
his
leadership
then
taunt
us
with
incapacity
for
these
flambeaus
and
rockets
directed
with
unerring
precision
taking
effect
in
the
very
centre
of
our
magazine
did
not
cause
in
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
a
falter
nor
a
wince
in
their
course
but
steadily
and
determinedly
they
pressed
their
way
to
the
completion
of
their
object
under
prosecution
in
this
design
the
enemy
was
thwarted
i
drop
every
reflection
and
feeling
of
unpleasantness
towards
my
young
brother
campbell
who
being
a
west
indian
probably
did
not
understand
those
and
formed
his
opinion
of
american
and
their
capacity
to
lead
from
the
estimate
they
set
upon
them
i
owe
it
to
posterity
the
destiny
of
my
race
the
great
adventure
into
which
i
am
embarked
and
the
position
i
sustain
to
it
to
make
this
record
with
all
christian
or
if
you
please
forgiveness
against
this
most
glaring
and
determined
act
of
theirs
to
blast
the
negro
prospects
in
this
his
first
effort
in
the
christian
era
to
work
out
his
own
moral
and
political
salvation
by
the
regeneration
of
his
fatherland
through
the
medium
of
a
scheme
and
thereby
take
the
credit
to
themselves
it
was
too
great
an
undertaking
for
negroes
to
have
the
credit
of
and
therefore
they
go
the
auspices
of
some
white
american
christians
to
be
black
it
would
seem
was
necessarily
to
be
ungodly
and
to
be
white
was
necessarily
to
be
godly
or
christian
in
the
estimation
of
some
with
a
grateful
heart
i
here
as
freely
record
as
an
equal
duty
i
owe
to
posterity
my
unfeigned
thanks
to
all
those
gentlemen
who
took
an
active
part
and
in
any
way
aided
the
mission
on
my
behalf
either
from
the
pulpit
by
the
contribution
of
books
stationery
charts
instruments
or
otherwise
especially
those
who
made
each
the
hundred
dollar
and
the
two
in
new
york
through
whose
instrumentality
and
influence
these
were
obtained
those
disinterested
and
voluntary
acts
of
kindness
i
never
shall
forget
whilst
reason
occupies
her
throne
and
would
here
willingly
record
their
names
had
i
their
consent
to
do
so
i
sailed
from
new
york
may
in
the
fine
captain
vessel
and
cargo
owned
by
johnson
turpin
and
dunbar
three
enterprising
colored
gentlemen
of

all
formerly
of

in
the
name
of

board
of

for

promotion
of
the
political
and
other
interest
of
the
colored
people
of

and
the
canadas
by
i
thank
them
i
can
not
close
this
section
without
expressing
my
obligations
to
captain
for
his
personal
kindness
to
me
and
also
to
his
first
officer
captain
vernon
locke
himself
a
who
took
the
position
of
first
officer
for
the
voyage
and
who
had
been
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
collecting
scientific
information
by
astronomical
meteorological
and
other
observations
for
lieutenant
maury
director
of
the
observatory
at
washington
i
am
greatly
indebted
for
many
acts
of
kindness
in
facilitating
my
microscopic
and
other
examinations
and
inquiries
during
the
voyage
concerning
the
and
i
learned
more
through
this
accomplished
seaman
than
i
had
ever
learned
before
the
first
by
examination
of
the
mollusca
which
were
frequently
caught
by
captain
for
my
accommodation
and
of
the
latter
by
oral
information
received
from
him
who
had
been
a
great
whaler
on
frequently
observing
those
huge
monsters
during
the
voyage
footnotes
shadd
was
elected
in
the
place
of
bailey
who
left
the
province
for
new
caledonia
on
the
day
of
june
lat
deg
long
deg
a
very
large
school
the
largest
captain
locke
said
that
he
had
ever
seen
or
read
of
probably
of
sperm
whales
made
their
appearance
in
the
segment
of
a
circle
to
windward
and
leeward
of
the
vessel
about
noon
continuing
in
sight
blowing
and
spouting
filling
the
air
with
spray
for
a
long
time
to
our
amusement
and
delight
the
captain
said
though
an
old
whaler
he
had
never
known
of
sperm
whales
in
that
latitude
before
and
from
the
immense
number
and
as
they
were
frequently
seen
as
we
approached
africa
many
times
on
different
days
afterwards
that
he
thought
a
new
whaling
point
had
been
discovered
other
whales
were
also
seen
frequently
in
these
latitudes
lazy
shy
old
bulls
which
floated
with
their
huge
backs
and
part
of
their
heads
out
of
water
so
as
to
expose
their
eyes
when
they
would
suddenly
disappear
and
as
quickly
appear
again
but
the
great
quantity
of
the
peculiar
upon
which
the
sperm
whale
feeds
made
it
ominous
according
to
the
opinion
of
captain
locke
that
a
great
new
sperm
whale
fishery
had
been
discovered
the
spawn
being
seen
during
several
days
sail
before
and
after
observing
the
great
school
i
should
not
close
this
part
of
my
report
without
stating
that
during
the
year
myers
wrote
to
the
royal
geographical
society
london
thomas
clegg
manchester
livingstone
and
perhaps
others
all
over
as

and
himself

the
letters
referred
to
were
written
without
my
knowledge
by
a
son
of

i
only
mention
the
fact
here
because

are

supposed

given

which
are
common
to
and
natives
of
this
part

which
i
shall
classify
as
the
pronounced

handsome
and
comparing
favorably
in

though
neither
so
nor
with
the
small
cattle
in
the
interior
counties
of
pennsylvania
where
no
attention
is
paid
scientifically
to
the
breeding
of
cattle
though
the
liberia
or
bassa
are
much
the
heaviest
and
handsomely
made
like
the
or
hereafter
to

described
resembling
the
durham

of

swine

are
plentiful
horses
none
why
i
saw
but
one
horse
in
liberia
and
that
on
the
gaudilla
farm
of
anderson
and
though
as
the
liberians
themselves
informed
me
they
have
been
taken
there
by
the
mandingo
and
golah
traders
they
never
lived
and
why
if
they
live
in
other
parts
of
africa
on
the
western
coast
which
they
do
even
near
the
as
will
hereafter
be
shown
do
they
not
live
in
liberia
the
civilized
settlements
of
which
as
yet
except
on
the
paul
and
at
careysburg
are
confined
to
the
coast
there
are
certainly
causes
for
this
which
i
will
proceed
to
show
horse
feed
pasturage
hay
in
the
first
place
horses
like
all
other
animals
must
have
feed
naturally
adapted
to
their
sustenance
this
consists
mainly
of
grass
herbage
and
grains
especially
the
latter
when
the
animal
is
domesticated
secondly
adequate
shelter
from
sun
and
weather
as
in
the
wild
state
by
instinct
they
obtain
these
necessary
comforts
for
themselves
no
cultivated
farms
no
shelter
for
horses
up
to
the
time
then
when
the
liberians
ceased
the
experiment
of
keeping
horses
they
had
not
commenced
in
any
extensive
manner
to
cultivate
farms
consequently
did
not
produce
either
maize
indian
corn
guinea
corn
an
excellent
article
for
horses
in
africa
resembling
the
american
broom
corn
both
in
the
stock
blade
and
grain
the
latter
being
larger
and
browner
than
those
of
the
broom
corn
and
more
nutritious
than
oats
peas
nor
any
other
grain
upon
which
those
animals
are
fed
and
the
great
heavy
rich
rank
pseudo
of
the
country
was
totally
unfit
for
them
there
being
no
grass
suited
either
for
pasturage
or
hay
again
i
was
informed
by
intelligent
respectable
liberians
that
to
their
knowledge
there
never
had
been
a
stable
or
proper
shelter
prepared
for
a
horse
but
that
they
had
in
one
or
more
instances
known
horses
to
be
kept
standing
in
the
sun
the
entire
day
and
in
the
open
air
and
weather
during
the
entire
night
while
their
owners
had
them
no
horses
why
and
why
not
it
is
very
evident
from
this
that
horses
could
not
live
in
liberia
and
since
the
fly
introduced
to
the
notice
of
the
scientific
world
recently
by
doctor
livingstone
the
african
explorer
has
never
been
seen
nor
heard
of
in
this
part
of
the
continent
nor
any
other
insect
that
tormented
them
those
must
have
been
the
prime
causes
of
fatality
to
these
noble
and
most
useful
domestic
creatures
i
have
been
thus
explicit
in
justice
to
liberia
even
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
some
very
intelligent
and
highly
qualified
gentlemen
in
that
country
among
whom
is
my
excellent
friend
doctor
roberts
i
think
because
i
believe
that
horses
can
live
there
as
well
as
in
other
parts
of
africa
when
fairly
and
scientifically
inquired
into
and
tested
proper
feed
and
care
i
have
no
doubt
will
verify
my
opinion
and
should
i
but
be
instrumental
by
calling
the
attention
of
my
brethren
in
liberia
to
these
facts
in
causing
them
to
test
the
matter
it
will
be
but
another
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
black
race
should
take
their
affairs
in
their
own
hands
instead
of
placing
them
in
the
hands
of
others
exploration
farms
sugar
coffee
my
explorations
in
liberia
extended
to
every
civilized
settlement
in
the
republic
except
careysburg
and
much
beyond
these
limits
up
the
kavalla
river
there
is
much
improvement
recently
up
the
paul
river
by
the
opening
up
of
fine
and
in
some
cases
extensive
farms
of
coffee
and
sugar
also
producing
rice
ginger
arrowroot
and
pepper
many
of
which
have
erected
upon
them
handsome
and
dwellings
also
sugar
mills
and
machinery
for
the
manufacture
of
sugar
and
molasses
which
articles
manufactured
compare
favorably
with
the
best
produced
in
other
countries
there
has
as
yet
been
no
improvement
introduced
in
the
hulling
and
drying
of
coffee
there
being
probably
not
enough
produced
to
induce
the
introduction
of
machinery
i
am
informed
that
there
have
also
been
commenced
several
good
farms
on
the
junk
river
which
district
farther
than
the
settlement
at
the
mouth
i
did
not
visit
the
people
are
willing
and
anxious
for
improvement
and
on
introducing
to
many
of
the
farmers
the
utility
of
cutting
off
the
centre
of
each
young
so
soon
as
it
grew
above
the
reach
of
a
man
of
ordinary
height
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
immediately
commence
the
execution
of
the
work
the
branches
of
the
tree
spread
in
proportion
to
the
checking
of
the
height
hence
instead
of
eight
feet
apart
as
some
of
the
farmers
have
done
the
trees
should
be
planted
at
least
twenty
feet
apart
thus
leaving
ample
space
between
for
the
spreading
of
the
branches
the
tree
should
never
be
permitted
to
grow
too
high
to
admit
of
the
berry
being
picked
from
the
ground
or
at
least
from
a
stand
which
may
be
stepped
upon
without
climbing
schools
the
schools
are
generally
good
every
settlement
being
amply
accommodated
with
them
and
in
monrovia
and
at
cape
palmas
the
classics
are
being
rigidly
prosecuted
churches
missionaries
churches
are
many
and
commodious
of
every
christian
denomination
except
i
believe
the
roman
catholic
the
missionaries
seem
to
be
doing
a
good
work
there
being
many
earnest
and
faithful
laborers
among
them
of
both
sexes
black
and
white
and
many
native
catechists
and
teachers
as
well
as
some
few
preachers
business
professions
theology
medicine
law
the
principal
business
carried
on
in
liberia
is
that
of
trading
in
native
and
foreign
produce
the
greater
part
being
at
the
capital
the
greater
part
of
merchants
here
are
liberians
but
there
are
also
three
white
houses
two
german
and
one
american
and
along
the
coast
there
are
a
number
of
native
the
proprietors
of
which
are
white
foreigners
with
black
agents
many
of
the
liberian
clergy
of
all
denominations
are
well
educated
gentlemen
and
the
medical
profession
is
well
represented
by
highly
accomplished
physicians
but
of
all
the
professions
the
law
is
the
most
poorly
represented
there
being
as
i
learnt
when
there
but
one
young
gentlemen
at
the
bar
who
had
been
bred
to
the
profession
and
not
a
judge
on
the
bench
who
was
learned
in
the
law
this
i
do
not
mention
in
disparagement
of
the
gentlemen
who
fill
those
honorable
positions
of
presiding
over
the
legal
investigations
of
their
country
as
many
indeed
i
believe
the
majority
of
them
are
clergymen
who
from
necessity
have
accepted
those
positions
and
fill
their
own
legitimate
callings
with
credit
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
liberia
will
have
her
learned
counsellors
and
jurists
dispensing
law
disseminating
legal
opinions
and
framing
digests
as
well
as
other
countries
for
the
benefit
of
nations
council
at
grand
bassa
i
held
a
council
with
some
of
the
most
eminent
liberians
among
whom
were
several
members
of
the
national
legislature
the
venerable
judge
hanson
in
the
chair
several
able
speeches
were
made
the
objects
of
my
mission
and
policy
approved
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
profound
sensation
produced
at
that
council
and
one
of
the
most
happy
hours
of
my
life
when
the
honored
old
judge
and
sage
sanctioning
my
adventure
declared
that
rather
than
it
should
fail
he
would
join
it
himself
and
with
emotion
rose
to
his
feet
the
effect
was
inexpressible
each
person
being
as
motionless
as
a
statue
public
affairs
municipal
and
public
improvements
the
laws
of
liberia
seem
to
be
well
constructed
and
framed
to
suit
the
wants
of
the
people
and
their
public
affairs
are
quite
well
and
creditably
conducted
but
there
is
a
great
deficiency
in
public
improvements
and
as
i
learned
and
facts
from
actual
observation
verified
until
comparatively
recent
also
in
public
spirit
there
are
no
public
buildings
of
note
or
respectable
architectural
designs
no
harbor
improvements
except
a
lighthouse
each
on
the
beautiful
summit
of
cape
messurado
and
cape
palmas
not
even
a
buoy
to
indicate
the
shoal
no
pier
except
a
little
one
at
palmas
nor
an
attempt
at
a
respectable
wharfage
for
canoes
and
lighters
the
large
keels
owned
by
every
trading
vessel
home
and
foreign
which
touches
there
and
with
the
exception
of
a
handsome
three
and
a
half
miles
out
from
harper
cape
palmas
beyond
mount
vaughan
there
is
not
a
public
or
municipal
road
in
all
liberia
neither
have
i
seen
a
town
which
has
a
paved
street
in
it
although
the
facilities
for
paving
in
almost
all
the
towns
are
very
great
owing
to
the
large
quantities
of
stone
everywhere
to
be
had
the
capital
no
city
and
what
is
surprising
monrovia
although
the
capital
has
not
a
city
municipality
to
give
it
respectability
as
such
hence
there
is
neither
mayor
nor
council
city
council
i
mean
to
give
character
to
any
public
occasion
but
his
excellency
the
president
the
chief
executive
of
the
nation
must
always
be
dragged
down
from
his
reserved
and
elevated
position
and
made
as
common
as
a
common
policeman
to
head
every
little
petty
affair
among
the
people
the
town
was
once
by
the
wisdom
of
some
legislators
chartered
into
a
city
and
chosen
mayor
who
by
his
high
intelligence
and
fitness
for
the
office
had
commenced
the
most
useful
and
commendable
improvements
but
the
wisdom
of
other
legislators
after
a
year
duration
in
consequence
of
the
heavy
expenses
incurred
to
make
monrovia
where
big
folks
lived
a
fine
place
repealed
the
act
degrading
their
capital
to
a
town
that
is
the
same
as
declaring
that
a
court
shall
not
have
a
judge
the
nation
a
president
or
executive
or
there
shall
be
no
head
at
all
hence
to
reduce
the
judge
to
the
grade
of
a
lawyer
the
lawyer
to
that
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
president
of
the
nation
to
that
of
the
county
magistrate
and
the
county
magistrate
to
that
of
a
constable
how
much
respect
would
a
people
be
entitled
to
who
would
act
thus
they
must
understand
that
nothing
is
greater
than
its
head
and
the
people
of
a
nation
can
not
rise
above
the
level
of
the
head
of
their
nation
any
more
than
the
body
of
the
individual
in
its
natural
position
can
be
raised
above
the
head
it
is
just
so
with
a
town
population
a
villager
is
a
villager
a
citizen
is
a
citizen
and
a
metropolitan
is
a
metropolitan
each
of
which
is
always
expected
to
have
a
standing
commensurate
with
his
opportunities
ways
and
means
one
word
as
a
suggestion
in
political
economy
to
the
young
politician
of
liberia
always
bear
in
mind
that
the
fundamental
principle
of
every
nation
is
with
the
to
create
their
own
ways
and
without
this
there
is
no
capacity
for
in
this
short
review
of
public
affairs
it
is
done
neither
to
disparage
nor
the
gentlemen
of
liberia
with
whom
from
the
acquaintance
i
have
made
with
them
in
the
great
stride
for
black
nationality
i
can
make
common
cause
and
hesitate
not
to
regard
them

there
has
been
much
progress
made
in
the
various
industrial
vocations
within
a
few
years
past
by
the

like
his
predecessor
president
roberts
in
pressing
the
claims
of
his
country
before
the
nations
of

president
benson
has
spared
no
authority
which
he
possessed
in
developing
the
agricultural
resources
of
his
country
every
man
has
his
and
in
his
turn
probably
becomes
a
for
the
time
being
according
to
his
faculty
consequently
my
opinion
is
that
the
and
mission
of
president
roberts
for
the
time
being
were
the
establishment
of
a
nationality
and
that
of
president
benson
the
development
of
its
resources
especially
the
agricultural
neither
of
these
gentlemen
therefore
might
be
as
each
may

my
mission
settlement
and
sites
of
towns
i
conclude
this
section
by
remarking
that
monrovia
is
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
eligible
sites
for
a
city
that
i
ever
saw
and
only
lacks
the
population
and
will
of
the
people
to
make
it
a
most
beautiful
place
and
how
much
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
charter
was
repealed
and
mayor
and
the
city
council
cut
off
in
the
beginning
of
the
first
steps
towards
a
national
pride
which
was
to
have
a
capital
city
in
reality
as
well
as
name
how
unsightly
to
a
stranger
as
he
steps
from
the
boat
at
the
mouth
of
stockton
creek
on
the
messurado
river
is
the
rude
and
rugged
steep
leading
by
simple
pathways
in
true
native
style
from
the
warehouses
up
to
the
town
which
if
improved
as
it
might
and
should
be
would
be
one
of
the
most
pleasing
as
well
as
attractive
approaches
to
any
city
in
the
world
not
even
is
there
a
respectable
public
or
market
space
in
town
but
wisdom
decreed
it
otherwise
and
for
the
present
it
must
be
so
wisdom
in
this
case
hath
built
her
house
neither
hath
she
hewn
out
the
stone
pillars
leading
from
the
beach
another
good
site
for
a
city
is
edina
on
the
northeast
side
of
the
john
river
opposite
buchanan
grand
bassa
which
doubtless
in
time
buchanan
will
include
this
is
also
a
handsome
place
from
the
gradually
rising
elevation
edina
is
the
residence
of
that
good
old
gentleman
judge
hanson
junk
little
bassa
and
sinou
are
also
good
but
each
of
these
are
low
and
consequently
not
so
imposing
next
to
monrovia
is
cape
palmas
for
beauty
of
location
and
scenery
and
a
stranger
will
more
readily
be
pleased
at
first
sight
with
harper
than
the
capital
a
beautiful
city
will
in
time
occupy
the
extensive
cape
for
several
miles
back
including
mount
vaughan
and
the
country
around
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
this
place
presents
greater
evidences
of
public
improvement
than
any
town
in
liberia
and
the
only
place
in
the
country
which
has
a
regular
wagon
road
with
running
upon
it
buildings
the
private
buildings
in
liberia
are
generally
good
and
substantial
and
especially
those
of
monrovia
built
of
brick
many
of
them
are
handsome
and
quite
extensive
mansions
the
warehouses
mostly
being
built
of
stone
the
wooden
houses
generally
are
frames
and
and
not
as
some
romancers
and
would
have
it
being
either
log
bamboo
or
mud
huts
to
take
the
settlers
generally
there
can
not
be
much
fault
found
with
their
style
of
living
except
perhaps
in
some
instances
rather
a
little
too
much
extravagance
caldwell

millsburg

pleasant
and
prospectively
promising
villages
and
deserve
a
notice
in
this
place

the
residence
of

whom
i
am
indebted
for
personal
favors
and
much
useful
information

a
fact
to
which
my
attention
was
called
by

hereafter
account

that

am
happy

recently
received
from

that
monrovia
has
again
been
created

organized

diseases
cause
remedy
first
symptoms
the
first
sight
and
impressions
of
the
coast
of
africa
are
always
inspiring
producing
the
most
pleasant
emotions
these
pleasing
sensations
continue
for
several
days
more
or
less
until
they
gradually
merge
into
feelings
of
almost
intense
excitement
not
only
mentally
but
the
entire
physical
system
share
largely
in
it
so
that
it
might
be
termed
a
hilarity
of
feeling
almost
akin
to
approaching
intoxication
or
as
i
imagine
like
the
sensation
produced
by
the
beverage
of
champagne
wine
never
having
enjoyed
the
taste
for
it
i
can
not
say
from
experience
second
stage
of
symptoms
the
first
symptoms
are
succeeded
by
a
relaxity
of
feelings
in
which
there
is
a
disposition
to
stretch
gape
and
yawn
with
fatigue
third
stage
of
symptoms
the
second
may
or
may
not
be
succeeded
by
actual
febrile
attacks
with
nausea
chills
or
violent
headache
but
whether
or
not
such
symptoms
ensue
there
is
one
most
remarkable
as
almost
and
i
think
quite
a
necessary
affection
attendant
upon
the
acclimation
at
this
incipient
stage
feeling
of
regret
that
you
left
your
native
country
for
a
strange
one
an
almost
frantic
desire
to
see
friends
and
nativity
a
despondency
and
loss
of
the
hope
of
ever
seeing
those
you
love
at
home
these
feelings
of
course
must
be
resisted
and
as
a
mere
morbid
affection
of
the
at
the
time
arising
from
an
approaching
disease
which
is
not
necessarily
serious
and
may
soon
pass
off
which
is
really
the
case
its
effects
it
is
generally
while
laboring
under
this
symptom
that
persons
send
from
africa
such
despairing
accounts
of
their
disappointments
and
sufferings
with
horrible
feelings
of
dread
for
the
worst
to
come
recovery
when
an
entire
recovery
takes
place
the
love
of
the
country
is
most
ardent
and
abiding
i
have
given
the
symptoms
to
make
a
proper
impression
first
diseases
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
give
a
section
in
my
report
entirely
to
the
diseases
of
liberia
which
are
the
same
as
those
in
other
parts
of
africa
with
their
complication
with
diseases
carried
from
america
by
the
settlers
native
diseases
peculiar
character
in
liberia
the
native
diseases
are
mainly
the
native
fever
which
is
nothing
but
the
of
america
known
in
different
parts
as
and
and
with
its
varied
forms
of
and
its
worst
form
of
when
it
most
generally
assumes
the
type
of
the
american
southern
states
in
this
condition
the
typhoid
symptoms
with
give
unmistakable
evidence
of
the
character
of
the
malady
the
native
fever
which
is
common
to
all
parts
of
africa
in
liberia
while
to
my
judgment
not
necessarily
fatal
and
in
by
far
the
greater
percentage
of
cases
in
the
hands
of
an
intelligent
skilful
physician
quite
manageable
is
generally
much
worse
in
its
character
there
than
in
the
yoruba
country
where
i
have
been
the
symptoms
appear
to
be
much
more
aggravated
and
the
patient
to
suffer
more
intensely
the
density
and
rankness
of
the
vegetable
growth
the
saturation
of
the
air
continually
with
fragrance
and
other
and
the
from
the
mangrove
swamps
i
assign
as
the
cause
of
difference
in
the
character
of
the
same
disease
in
different
parts
of
the
continent
the
habits
also
of
the
settlers
have
much
to
do
with
the
character
of
the
disease
a
free
indulgence
in
improper
food
and
drink
which
doubtless
is
the
case
in
many
instances
are
exciting
causes
to
take
the
malady
and
aggravating
when
suffering
under
it
there
are
several
other
diseases
that
might
be
named
which
i
reserve
for
a
section
on
another
part
of
africa
and
confine
my
remarks
simply
to
the
complication
of
the
native
with
foreign
all
or
persons
where
the
affection
has
not
been
fully
suppressed
may
become
easy
victims
to
the
fever
in
liberia
or
lingering
sufferers
from
or
a
frightful
enlargement
of
the
limbs
is
another
horrible
type
that
disease
in
such
chronically
affected
persons
may
assume
but
any
chronic
affection
especially
lung
liver
kidney
and
rheumatic
when
not
too
deeply
seated
may
by
favorable
acclimation
become
eliminated
and
the
ailing
person
entirely
recover
from
the
disease
natural
and
the
natural
remedy
for
the
permanent
decrease
of
the
native
fever
is
the
clearing
up
and
cultivation
of
the
land
which
will
be
for
some
time
yet
to
come
tardy
as
emigration
to
liberia
is
very
slow
and
the
natives
very
unlike
those
of
yoruba
cultivate
little
or
nothing
but
rice
cassaba
and
yams
and
these
in
comparative
small
patches
so
that
there
is
very
little
need
for
clearing
off
the
forest
neither
have
they
in
this
part
of
africa
any
large
towns
of
substantial
houses
all
of
which
would
necessitate
a
great
deal
of
clearing
but
instead
they
consist
of
small
clusters
of
reed
or
bamboo
huts
in
a
circle
always
in
the
densest
of
the
forest
which
can
scarcely
ever
be
seen
except
they
be
situated
on
a
high
hill
until
you
are
right
upon
them
the
clearing
away
of
the
mangrove
swamps
which
is
practicable
will
add
greatly
to
the
sanitary
condition
of
liberia
but
this
also
will
take
time
as
it
must
be
the
work
of
a
general
improvement
in
the
country
brought
about
by
populating
and
civilizing
progress
the
treatment
of
the
native
fever
must
be
active
and
prudential
but
the
remedies
are
simple
and
easily
obtained
being
such
as
may
be
had
at
any
apothecary
shop
the
of
in
moderate
doses
three
or
four
times
a
day

the
usual
attention
to
the
febrile
changes

and
drinks
taking
care
to
prevent
acridness

persons
going
to

shall
speak
more
pointedly

the
domestic
or
social
customs

be
avoided

observed
that
all
elevated
places

monrovia

i
reached
on

the
of
november
explorations
abbeokuta
here
i
met
for
the
first
time
with
my
colleague
and
assistant
commissioner
robert
campbell
from
whom
at
lagos
i
found
a
letter
waiting
for
my
arrival
in
the
hands
of
acting
consul
lieut
edward
lodder
of
her
majesty
war
vessel
brun
which
continually
lies
in
the
harbor
directly
opposite
and
near
to
the
consulate
consul
campbell
since
deceased
had
paid
an
official
visit
to
england
and
lieut
lodder
was
supplying
his
place
towns
from
abbeokuta
from
abbeokuta
population
we
proceeded
to
ijaye
population
reckoned
by
the
white
missionaries
and
officers
of
the
niger
expedition
of
her
majesty
service
who
passed
through
once
at
oyo
population
ogbomoso
population
illorin
population
returning
back
ogbomoso
to
oyo
when
by
arrangement
campbell
leaving
me
at
oyo
returned
to
abbeokuta
by
a
new
route
through
isen
and
small
places
whence
i
a
week
later
also
by
another
strange
route
returned
passing
through
iwo
population
and
ibaddan
population
an
immense
city
the
estimated
number
of
inhabitants
by
the
civil
corps
who
passed
through
being
it
will
be
seen
that
i
have
made
a
liberal
deduction
of
or
from
this
estimate
still
the
population
is
immense
and
the
city
extensive
the
walls
embracing
an
outline
of
at
least
miles
return
to
lagos
from
abbeokuta
the
water
being
very
low
it
was
thought
advisable
that
campbell
take
charge
of
all
our
luggage
and
proceed
by
way
of
the
ogun
to
lagos
he
having
disposed
of
his
horse
at
abbeokuta
whilst
i
on
horseback
with
william
johnson
our
cook
the
only
servant
we
retained
a
civilized
native
as
guide
and

proceeded

some

the
first

or
low
land
from

extends
about
or
forty
miles
interiorly
with
but
occasionally
small
rugged
or
rocky
elevations
breaking
the

when
it
almost

rises
into
elevated

the
soil
of

for
ten

is
moist

incorporating
with
a
dark

earth
which
extending
quite
through
the
second

continually
varies
in
quality
consistence
and
color
from
a
sandy

and
iron

appearance
to
a
and
rich
alluvial
color
and

the
whole
being
exceedingly
fertile
and
productive
as
no
district
through
which
we
traveled
was
without
cultivation
more

that
always
in
a
high

whatever
the

the

throughout
these

consist
of
primitive
granite
quartz

conglomerates
with
occasionally
strata
of

which
are
found
mainly
in
the
beautiful

which

the
minerals
consist
of
iron
in
the
greatest
abundance
which
at
present
is
smelted
by
the
natives
from
the
clay
and
every
town
of
any
note
or
size
has
not
only
its
blacksmiths
shops
but
the
largest
all
have
iron
smelting
works
at
ijaye
there
is
quite
an
extensive
and
interesting
establishment
of
the
kind
and
as
they
manufacture
there
must
be
also
zinc
and
copper
found
there
indications
of
the

often
seen
by
the
color
of
certain
little

but
more

the

and
for
the

all
the
fruits
common
to
the
tropics
are
found
in
these
regions
in
fact
so
redundant
is
africa
with
these
productions
that
she
combines
the
whole
within
herself
that
is
there
are
some
fruits
found
in
the
tropical
parts
of
asia
south
america
the
asiatic
and
west
india
islands
common
or
peculiar
to
one
which
may
not
be
found
in
the
other
but
all
of
which
it
may
safely
be
said
can
be
found
in
africa
pineapples
the
most
delicious
in
flavor
and
taste
conceivable
oranges

same
bananas
the
finest

equally
so
mangrove
plums
a
peculiar
but
delightful
and
wholesome
fruit
said
by
the
natives
to
be
a
guavas
and
soursops
a
delightful
of
pure
without
the
least
acridness
as
well
as
a
hundred
others
which
i
can
not
now
name
the
papaw
or
also
grows
very
finely
here
and
is
a
very
useful
and
wholesome
fruit
when
green
stewed
and
mashed
and
with
the
usual
culinary
spices
it
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
best
green
for
which
reason
it
makes
excellent
pies
when
fully
ripe
it
can
not
be
told
from
the
finest
muskmelon
or
cantelope
agricultural
products
the
agricultural
labor
of
this
part
of
africa
is
certainly
very
great
and
merits
the
attention
of
every
intelligent
inquirer
from
the
simple
fact
that
so
far
as
it
exhibits
the
industry
of
the
inhabitants
it
shows
the
means
which
may
be
depended
upon
for
a
development
of
the
commercial
resources
of
the
country
palm
oil
palm
oil
is
produced
in
great
abundance
as
a
staple
commodity
among
themselves
as
well
as
for
exportation
since
the
common
light
for
houses
consists
of
palm
oil
burnt
in
native
manufactured
lamps
some
constructed
of
iron
and
others
of
earthenware
the
oil
of
the
nut
is
the
most
general
in
use
among
the
natives
both
for
light
and
cooking
because
it
is
the
richest
being
the
most
unctuous
this
use
of
the
is
certainly
an
antiquated
custom
among
the
people
of
this
region
whilst
those
contiguous
to
liberia
have
recently
learned
that
the
kernels
could
be
put
to
commercial
use
by
the
discovery
or
rather
practical
application
by
herron
of
grand
bassa
liberia
and
subsequent
demand
by
the
french
traders
the
fact
that
the
yorubas
generally
produce
their
charcoal
from
the
hull
of
the
palm
nut
is
an
evidence
of
the
and
abundant
use
of
the
latter
article
for
the
manufacture
of
oil
they
have
regular
establishments
for
the
manufacture
of
the
palm
oil
with
vats
and
apparatus
simple
though
they
be
places
and
persons
for
each
process
as
bruising
the
fruit
from
the
nut
boiling
carrying
the
pulp
to
a
vat
where
it
is
pressed
and
washed
to
extract
the
oil
one
to
skim
it
off
from
the
top
of
the
liquid
another
to
carry
off
the
fiber
of
the
pulp
or
bruised
fruit
which
fiber
is
also
appropriated
to
kindling
and
other
uses
there
is
no
such
method
of
extracting
the
oil
as
the
mistaken
idea
so
frequently
reported
by
african
traders
from
europe
and
america
that
the
natives
bruise
the
nut
with
stones
in
holes
made
in
the
ground
thereby
losing
a
large
percentage
of
the
oil
even
among
the
crudest
they
know
better
than
this
and
many
use
shallow
troughs
made
of
wood
in
some
parts
of
africa
as
the
grebo
golah
and
some
other
peoples
on
the
western
coast
adjacent
to
liberia
palm
trees
cultivated
camwood
ivory
all
through
the
yoruba
country
the
palm
tree
is
cultivated
being
regularly
trimmed
and
pruned
and
never
cut
down
in
clearing
a
farm
except
when
from
age
the
tree
has
ceased
to
bear
or
is
of
the
male
species
when
it
is
cut
down
for
the
wine
which
is
the
sap
extracted
from
the
trunk
in
a
horizontal
position
by
boring
a
hole
near
the
top
and
catching
it
in
a
vessel
when
it
is
drunk
either
before
during
or
after
fermentation
camwood
is
also
very
plentiful
but
owing
to
its
great
weight
and
the
inconvenience
at
present
of
transportation
it
does
not
enter
extensively
into
the
commerce
of
these
parts
except
as
dyestuffs
in
the
native
markets

and
many

and
i
am
certain
that
beets
parsnips

carrots
which
we
did
not
see
under
cultivation
could
be
successfully
raised
if
desired

grows
freely
in

of

if
planted
in
the
right
season
potatoes
none
whether
or
not
the
common
potato
of
america
and
europe
can
be
propagated
here
has
not
been
tested
but
such
is
the
excellence
of
the
yam
that
served
up
in
the
same
manner
there
is
little
or
no
difference
between
them
and
potatoes
and
i
am
certain
that
when
well
cooked
mashed
and
seasoned
the
best
judge
could
not
tell
them
from
good
potatoes
i
mean
good
yams
because
they
differ
in
quality
like
potatoes
manufactories
iron
brass
glass
crockeryware
is
manufactured
very
extensively
of
almost
every
conceivable
size
and
kind
of

for
various
purposes
some
of
them
are
quite
handsome
and
all
nearly
of
the
ancient
oriental
mould
the
largest
earthen
vessels
i
ever
saw
are
made
by
these
people
some
of
them
being
large
enough
for
small
cisterns
iron
implements
for
agricultural
and
military
as
well
as
other
domestic
purposes
are
made
by
them
in
every
large
city
they
make
excellent
razors
which
shave
quite
well
as
also
other
knives
which
prove
that
they
have
the
art
of
tempering
iron
brass
as
well
as
glass
ornaments
and
trinkets
are
made
in
considerable
quantities
inhabitants
the
people
are
of
fine
physical
structure
and
anatomical
conformation
well
and
regularly
featured
not
varying
more
in
this
particular
from
the
best
specimen
of
their
own
race
than
the
caucasian
or
from
that
of
theirs
they
are
very
polite
their
language
abounding
in
vowels
and
consequently
euphonious
and
agreeable
affable
sociable
and
tractable
seeking
information
with
readiness
and
evincing
willingness
to
be
taught
they
are
shrewd
intelligent
and
industrious
with
high
conceptions
of
the
supreme
being
only
using
their
images
generally
as
mediators
so
soon
said
an
intelligent
missionary
as
you
can
convince
them
that
there
is
a
mediator
to
whom
you
talk
but
can
not
just
so
soon
can
you
make
christians
of
them
their
idea
being
that
god
is
too
great
to
be
directly
approached
therefore
there
must
be
a
mediator
to
whom
they
must
talk
that
they
can
see
when
god
will
listen
and
answer
if
pleased
how
received
by
them
after
my
arrival
at
abbeokuta
not
going
out
for
two
days
they
expecting
me
through
information
from
campbell
the
third
day
the
chief
atambala
called
upon
me
inviting
me
in
turn
to
call
and
see
him
in
a
few
days
after
the
king
had
a
popular
religious
festival
in
the
great
public
space
where
there
were
assembled
many
chiefs
and
elders
but
on
our
approach
the
old
king
sent
his
messenger
to
escort
us
to
the
porch
of
the
piazza
upon
which
he
was
seated
eagerly
grasping
me
by
the
hand
bidding
me
welcome
to
abbeokuta
and
his
court
telling
me
pointing
to
campbell
that
he
was
acquainted
with
him
and
had
heard
of
me
through
him
native
estimate
of
civilized
educated
men
in
december
a
meeting
of
the
native
chiefs
and
others
was
held
at
the
residence
of
the
great
chief
ogubonna
concerning
the
price
of
cotton
on
the
meeting
assembling
and
finding
that
we
were
not
present
the
chief
at
once
despatched
a
messenger
requesting
our
immediate
attendance
as
we
knew
how
things
ought
to
be
done
on
going
down
we
found
a
large
assemblage
waiting
among
whom
were
samuel
and
josiah
crowther
robbing
during
rebeiro
and

civilized
native
gentlemen
also

the
chief
ogubonna
was
chosen
chairman
and
upon
a
motion
by
campbell
seconded
by
hughes
robbing
was
chosen
the
meeting
went
off
well
we
making
many
suggestions
during
the
proceedings
which
were
always
received
with
approbation
the
following
from
the
native
minister
being
his
own
writing
and
composition
will
explain
itself
abbeokuta
igbore
delany
esq
dear
sir
a
meeting
of
the
wesleyan
missionary
society

affectionately
edwd
bickersteth
wesleyan
minister
an
early
answer
will
be
much
obliged
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
to
this
kind
invitation
the
copy
of
reply
is
now
mislaid
when
at
the
appointed
time
a
crowded
house
was
assembled
influence
of
civilization
native
demonstration
in
a
simple
and
comprehensive
address
made
to
them
being
interpreted
by
the
minister
as
i
proceeded
such
was
the
effect
that
it
not
only
produced
their
unanimous
applause
but
aroused
during
a
native
civilized
merchant
who
had
never
before
spoken
in
public
to
his
feet
who
approved
of
what
i
had
said
with
such
an
appeal
of
native
eloquence
that
when
he
ceased
sixty
bags
of
cowries
or
estimating
them
at
or
a
bag
the
then
current
value
of
cowries
were
paid
down
on
the
spot
to
aid
the
spread
of
civilization
through
the
gospel
and
education
many
very
many
were
the
thanks
given
me
that
day
by
these
my
native
kinsmen
and
women
several
other
gentlemen
among
them
surgeon
samuel
crowther
the
pastor
rebeiro
and
campbell
my
colleague
also
addressed
them
official
transactions
many
had
been
the
social
friendly
and
official
interchanges
between
us
and
the
king
and
chiefs
during
our
stay
in
abbeokuta
when
on
the
the
day
after
the
missionary
meeting
the
following
document
was
duly
executed
with
the
express
understanding
that
no
heterogeneous
nor
promiscuous
masses
or
companies
but
select
and
intelligent
people
of
high
moral
as
well
as
religious
character
were
to
be
induced
to
go
out
and
i
am
sure
that
every
good
and
upright
person

for
carrying
on

that

was

had

obtained
her
fullest
confidence
as
an

a

a

she
had
previously
expressed
to
a

of
mine
that
she
had
more
hope
of

of
africa
through
me
than
ever
before
she
had
promised
to
place
the
entire

of

extensive

in

as
much
advantage
was
taken
of
her
by

about
sixty
persons
and
keeps
constantly
employed
about
three
hundred
and
sixty

bringing

she
had
come
with
a
private
retinue
of
six
or
seven
persons
her
secretary
a
man
and
several
to
counsel
and
give
me
a
written
statement
of
what
she
desired
me
to
do
having
conversed
for
some
time
after
receiving
my
admonition
concerning
the
part
which
i
had
learned
she
had
taken
with
arie
of

she
sat
some
time
after
positively
negativing
the
accusation
when
bidding
me
farewell
and
saying
that
she
would
me
a
letter
retired
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
her

charles

a
native
came
to
the
house
and
presenting
his
mistress
compliments
with
her
final
adieu
handed
me
a
written
paper
from
which
i
take
the
following
extracts
simply
to
show
the
general
feeling
and
frankness
of
these
people
as
well
as
the
hopes
and
confidence
they
have
in

going

april
sir
this
is
to
certify
you
that
it
is
with
a
willing
mind
i
come
to
you
for
help
and
i
trust
you
will
do
according
to
your
promise
i
return
you
my
sincere
gratitude
for
your
kind
information
gave
me
while
at
your
house
and
can
assure
you
that
all
what
you
heard
is
false
respecting
my
sending
guns
and
powder
to
arie
the
chief
of
ijaye
i
beg
to
say
you
must
not
forget
to
find
the
clerk
who
will
stop
at
lagos
to
ship
my
cargo
and
make
agreement
with
him
before
you
send
him
here
i
need
not
say
much
more
about
the
affairs
as
you
yourself
have
known
my
statements
with
hopes
that
you
are
well
i
am
dear
sir
your
humble
servant
tinuba
you
must
not
forget
to
send
the
two
i
beg
you
yours
tinuba
per
charles
jones
i
have
preferred
to
give
these
extracts
just
as
they
were
written
without
correcting
the
composition
in
any
way
royal
deference
to
black
men
the
liberality
which
is
here
accorded
to
the
people
of
abbeokuta
may
be
also
accorded
to
most
other
places
the
king
of
illorin
sat
in
his
court
exposed
to
our
view
because
he
said
we
were
his
people
a
privilege
which
he
never
allowed
a
strange
white
man
who
was
never
permitted
to
look
upon
his
royal
black
face
publicly
he
also
sent
with
us
an
escort
of
a
horseman
and
five
footmen
with
sword
and
spear
as
a
guard
of
honor
sending
us
cowries
to
pay
the
expenses
the
king
of
oyo
paid
us
distinguished
honors
through
his
great
arie
kufu
calling
me
a
relative
and
sending
the
chief
to
inquire
after
our
health
on
my
leaving
oyo
finally
he
sent
with
me
a
very
large
escort
at
the
head
of
whom
was
his
kufu
as
a
guard
of
honor
and
three
native
gentlemen
high
in
rank
as
my
special
carriers
these
gentle
men
complained
to
the
missioners
and
hinderer
at
ibaddan
that
i
was
quite
mistaken
as
to
their
true
social
position
at
home
to
this
i
plead
guilty
as
they
were
quite
right

as
well
as
the
fine

are
abundant
the
swine
consist
of
two
distinct
classes
the
common
descended
from
the
wild
a
long
lean
gaunt
brute
like
the
american
hog
and
the
guinea
a
animal
closely
resembling
the
berkshire
of
english
breeding
goats
sheep
the
goats
are
the
most
beautiful
shiny
plump
active
saucy
creatures
the
mutton
being
most
excellent
flesh
and
the
sheep
though
hairy
instead
of
woolly
in
every
other
particular
are
like
other
sheep
and
the
mutton
frequently
equaling
english
mutton
in
flavor
and
sweetness
i
suspect
the
common
sheep
of
this
country
to
be
of
another
genus
as
there
are
some
very
fine
woolly
sheep
in
the
interior
we
intend
testing
the
woolly
sheep
when
we
get
settled
there

but
must
be
regarded
as
among
the
most

as
well

are
bred
in
bornou
where
great
attention
is
paid
to
the

taken
by

as
a
few
years
since

probably
up
to
the
present
day
mules
were
reared
in
great
numbers
in

purchased
by
ohio
and
kentucky
muleteers
who
sold
them
in
the
eastern
and
northern
states
of
america
where
for
years
the
people
supposed
and
really
believed
that
they
were
bred
in
the
western
states
from
whence
they
were
purported
to
come
the
fine

as

long

forty

that
part
of

it
is
said
that
bornou
can
muster
fifteen
thousand
shonaas

mounted
they
are
the
greatest
breeders
of
cattle
in
the
country
and
annually
supply
soudan
with
from
two
to
three
thousand
horses
these
animals
are
used
for
riding

well
exercised

markets
and
domestic
habits
of
the
people
the
markets
are
also
worthy
of
note
and
by
their
regular
establishment
and
arrangement
indicate
to
a
certain
extent
the
element
and
organized
condition
of
the
people
every
town
has
its
regular
or
general
bazaar
and
everything
to
be
had
in
the
town
may
be
found
in
more
or
less
quantities
in
these
in
describing
the
large
cities
through
which
campbell
my
colleague
and
i
passed
and
those
through
which
i
passed
alone
none
of
which
were
under
seventy
thousand
of
a
population
there
were
numerous
smaller
places
of
various
sizes
from
very
small
villages
of
one
hundred
to
two
thousand
inhabitants
which
were
not
mentioned
in
the
enumerated
towns
of
these
i
may
mention
that
illorin
has
five
the
area
of
the
largest
comprising
about
ten
acres
and
the
general
market
of
abbeokuta
comprising
more
than
twelve
altogether
whilst
that
of
ijaye
contains
fully
twenty
acres
or
more
in
which
like
the
markets
generally
everything
may
be
obtained
these
markets
are
systematically
regulated
and
orderly
arranged
there
being
parts
and
places
for
everything
and
everything
in
their
places
with
officially
appointed
and
excellent
managing
the
cattle
department
of
the
abbeokuta
and
ijaye
markets
as
well
as
illorin
are
particularly
attractive
there
being
as
many
as
eight
hundred
sheep
at
one
time
in
either
of
the
two
former
and
horses
and
mules
as
well
as
sheep
and
goats
exhibited
in
the
latter
when
approaching
the
city
of
ibaddan
i
saw
at
a
brook
where
they
had
been
let
out
of
their
cages
or
coops
to
drink
and
wash
themselves
as
many
as
three
thousand
pigeons
and
squabs
going
to
the
ibaddan
market
the
following
description
of
the
illorin
market
extracted
from
central
africa
is
truthful
as
far
as
it
goes
and
will
give
a
general
idea
of
markets
in
the
great
cities
of
africa
the
most
attractive
object
next
to
the
curious
old
town
itself
and
it
is
always
old
is
the
market
here
the
women
sit
and
chat
all
day
from
early
morn
till
nine
at
night
to
sell
their
various
merchandise
some
of
the
sheds
however
are
occupied
by
barbers
who
shave
people
heads
and
faces
and
by
leather
dressers
who
make
charms
like
jewish
phylacteries
and
bridle
reins
shoes
sandals
and
by
dozens
and
scores
of
men
who
earn
an
honest
living
by
dressing
calabashes
and
ornamenting
them
with
various
neat
engravings
the
principal
market
hour
and
proper
time
to
see
all
the
wonders
is
in
the
evening
as
the
shades
of
evening
deepen
if
the
weather
allow
the
market
to
continue
and
there
is
no
moon
every
woman
lights
her
little
lamp
and
presently
the
market
presents
to
the
distant
observer
the
beautiful
appearance
of
innumerable
stars
the
commodities
sold
in
market
are
too
tedious
to
mention
even
if
all
could
be
remembered
besides
home
productions
there
are
frequently
imported
articles
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
various
kinds
of
meat
fowls
sheep
goats

and
no
one
knows
what
all
this
description
was
given
by
bowen
in
his
in
many
respects
admirable
work
published
in
after
a
missionary
residence
and
tour
of
seven
years
from
to
the
time
of
writing
among
the
people
of
whom
he
wrote
native
houses
and
cities
the
houses
are
built
of
unburnt
clay
which
hardens
in
the
sun
covered
with
a
beautiful
peculiar
grass
exhibiting
only
the
walls
to
the
streets
the
doors
all
opening
inside
of
these
walls
which
are
entered
by
a
gate
or
large
doorway
the
streets
generally
irregular
and
narrow
but
frequently
agreeably
relieved
by
wider
ones
or
large
open
spaces
or
parks
shaded
with
trees
all
presenting
a
scene
so
romantic
and
antiquated
in
appearance
that
you
can
not
resist
the
association
with
babylon
nineveh
tyre
and
thebais
the
buildings
are
heavy
and
substantial
for
their
kind
many
of
which
are
very
extensive
these
towns
and
cities
are
all
entrenched
and
walled
extending
entirely
around
them
that
of
abbeokuta
with
the
new
addition
being
miles
though
the
population
is
less
by
forty
thousand
than
ibaddan
which
embraces
about
miles
conjugal
and
filial
affection
activity
of
children
great
affection
exists
between
husband
and
wife
the
women
being
mostly
restricted
to
household
work
trading
and
gathering
in
the
fields
and
aiding
in
carrying
whilst
the
men
principally
do
the
digging
planting
chopping
and
other
hard
work
the
children
are
also
passionately
beloved
by
their
parents
sometimes
with
too
much
indulgence
they
are
very
active
and
every
day
some
of
them
of
all
sizes
may
be
seen
dashing
along
a
road
or
over
a
plain
at
fearful
speed
on
horseback
they
are
great
vaulters
and
and
boys
may
frequently
be
seen
to
spring
from
the
ground

before
lighting
on
their

population
of
monrovia
and
the
state
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
add
that
the
population
of
the
capital
of
liberia
is
certainly
not
above
three
thousand
though
they
claim
for
it
five
thousand
and
what
has
been
said
of
the
lack
and
seeming
paucity
of
public
improvement
may
be
much
extenuated
when
it
is
considered
that
the
entire
population
of
settlers
only
number
at
present
some
souls
the
native
population
being
or
as
now
incorporated
canine
and
feline
as
the
enquiry
has
been
frequently
made
of
me
as
to
whether
there
are
really
dogs
and
cats
in
africa
and
if
so
whether
they
are
like
other
dogs
and
cats
and
since
a
very
intelligent
american
clergyman
said
to
me
that
he
had
read
it
somewhere
as
a
fact
in
natural
history
that
dogs
in
africa
could
not
bark
i
simply
here
inform
the
curious
enquirer
that
there
are
dogs
and
cats
plentifully
in
africa
which
look
like
other
dogs
and
cats
and
assure
them
that
the
dogs
bark
eat
and
just
like
other
dogs
slavery
a
word
about
slavery
it
is
simply
preposterous
to
talk
about
slavery
as
that
term
is
understood
either
being
legalized
or
existing
in
this
part
of
africa
it
is
nonsense
the
system
is
a
patriarchal
one
there
being
no
actual
difference
socially
between
the
slave
called
by
their
protector
or
and
the
children
of
the
person
with
whom
they
live
such
persons
intermarry
and
frequently
become
the
heads
of
state
indeed
generally
so
as
i
do
not
remember
at
present
a
king
or
chief
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
whose
entire
members
of
the
household
from
the
lowest
domestic
to
the
highest
official
did
not
sustain
this
relation
to
him
they
calling
him
or
father
and
he
treating
them
as
children
and
where
this
is
not
the
case
it
either
arises
from
some
innovation
among
them
or
those
exceptional
cases
of
despotism
to
be
found
in
every
country
indeed
the
term
slave
is
unknown
to
them
only
as
it
has
been
introduced
among
them
by
whites
from
europe
and
america
so
far
from
abject
slavery
not
even
the
old
feudal
system
as
known
to
exist
until
comparatively
recent
in
enlightened
and
christian
europe
exists
in
this
part
of
africa
criminals
and
prisoners
of
war
are
into
slavery
among
themselves
just
as
was
the
custom
in
almost
every
civilized
country
in
the
world
till
very
lately
when
nothing
but
advanced
intelligence
and
progressive
christianity
among
the
people
put
a
stop
to
it
there
is
no
place
however
but
illorin
a
mohammedan
kingdom
where
we
ever
witnessed
any
exhibition
of
these
facts
how
slaves
are
obtained
slaves
are
abducted
by
marauding
kidnapping
depraved
natives
who
like
the
organized
bands
and
gangs
of
robbers
in
europe
and
america
go
through
the
country
thieving
and
stealing
helpless
women
and
children
and
men
who
may
be
overpowered
by
numbers
whole
villages
in
this
way
sometimes
fall
victims
to
these
human
monsters
especially
when
the
strong
young
men
are
out
in
the
fields
at
work
the
old
of
both
sexes
in
such
cases
being
put
to
death
whilst
the
young
are
hurried
through
some
private
way
down
to
the
slave
factories
usually
kept
by
europeans
generally
portuguese
and
spaniards
and
americans
on
some
secluded
part
of
the
coast

in
no
instances
are
the
parents
and
relatives
known
to
sell
their

people
into
slavery

indeed
in
cases
of
base
depravity
and

such
miserable
despots

the
kings
of

and

neither

the
diseases
in
this
part
of
africa
are
still
more
simple
than
those
of
liberia
and
even
the
for
known
causes
generally
is
much
less
severe
in
liberia
and
all
that
part
of
africa
the
entire
country
except
the
cleared
farms
in
the
republic
and
the
limited
of
the
natives
is
a
dense
forest
rank
with
the
growth
and
putrified
vegetation
of
a
thousand
ages
but
the
entire
aku
country
throughout
the
second
plateau
presents
a
very
different
phase
here
one
is
struck
with
the
beautiful
clear
country
which
continually
spreads
out
in
every
direction
around
and
except
the
thickets
or
forests
left
as
defences
ambuscades
and
arbors
of
rest
rugged
hilltops
and
gullies
there
is
nothing
but
recent
timber
to
be
found
growing
on
the
lands
timber
in
africa
is
reproduced
very
speedily
hence
may
be
found
in
some
parts
designedly
left
very
heavy
timber
but
the
greatest
unbroken
forest
through
which
we
passed
at
any
one
time
of
this
description
never
exceeded
i
think
ten
miles
all
the
spring
shallow
wells
generally
and
other
living
water
as
perennial
streams
is
both
and
if
the
constant
use
of
running
stream
water
be
a
fair
test
i
would
decide
as
wholesome
there
are
some
good
springs
in
africa
and
good
water
doubtless
may
everywhere
be
obtained
by
digging
suitable
wells
to
keep
water
cool
kind
of
vessels
drinking
water
in
the
tropics
should
always
be
kept
in
large
vessels
of
crockery

usually
termed
stone
and
earthen
ware
and
smaller

or
jugs
or

if
earthen
or
crockery
ware
can
not
be
obtained
for

use
by
all

use

wrap
around
it
a
cloth
or
any
kind

especially
flannel

being
the
best
which
keep
simply

the
water
in
the
vessel
by
from
the

be
made
or
kept
almost

the
cloth
wet
apparatus
a
most
simple
method
by
which
the
cloth
may
be
kept
wet
and
evaporation
thereby
kept
up
is
to
have
a
large
vessel
with
the
water
in
for
common
use
so
placed
that
a
small
vessel
with
water
can
be
suspended
over
it
in
such
a
manner
that
a
can
be
kept
constantly
on
the
cloth
the
cloth
being
first
saturated
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
a
very
small
drip
is
required
to
keep
up
the
dampness
the
drip
may
be
arranged
where
convenient
with
a
small
so
as
to
regulate
the
drop
or
the
more
primitive
method
of
a
little

put
into
a
hole
made
in
the
vessel
so
regulated
as
to
keep
up
a
sufficient
dripping
to
keep
the
cloth
of
sufficient
dampness
simple
as
this
may
appear
to
the
reader
it
is
an
important
sanitary
measure

immediate
comfort
of

the
atmosphere
in
this

of
the
continent
is
much
purer
than
that
of
liberia
and
the

round
about

although
incorporated
with

and

the

is
little
comparatively
of
the

sends
up

the
immense
fields
and
plains
of
grass
not
under

at
the
time
are
burnt
down
during

bringing
to

probably
unawares
to
them
a

throughout

kinds

subdue

a

rational
treatment

and
sometimes
but
not
frequently

the
principal

the
opthalmia
i
suspected
as
originating
from
taint
probably
having
been
primarily
carried
from
the
coast
as
it
was
not
so
frequently
met
with
as
to
warrant
the
idea
of
its
being
either
a
contagion
or
the
effects
of
poisonous

or

supposed

is
fearfully
common
all
through

i
having
frequently
seen
persons
especially
females
with
the
hernial
tumor
as
large
as
their
own
head
and
those
of
little
children
fully
as
large
as
the
head
of
an
infant
a
month
old
guinea
worm
a
singular
disease
affects
some
persons
though
i
have
never
seen
this
upon
a
native
and
believe
it
to
be
peculiar
to
the
region
round
about
liberia
the
person
whose
case
i
examined
had
formerly
resided
in
liberia
where
doubtless
the
disease
commenced
but
for
the
last
three
years
previously
had
resided
at
ijaye
in
the
capacity
of
cook
for
the
american
baptist
missionaries
revs
phillips
and
stone
and
lady
and
then
resided
at
abbeokuta
this
is
a
peculiar
ulceration
of
the
leg
immediately
above
the
where
they
say
it
usually
commences
the
edges
of
the
ulcer
and
the
cuticle
quite
up
to
the
edge
and
all
the
surrounding
parts
having
a
healthy
appearance
as
though
a
portion
of
the
flesh
had
been
recently
torn
out
leaving
the
cavity
as
it
then
was
the
most
peculiar
feature
of
this
singular
disease
is
a
which
coming
out
from
the
integuments
of
the
muscles
of
the
leg
above
hangs
suspended
in
the
cavity
ulcer
the
lower
end
loose
and
somewhat
inclined
to
coil
and
when
out
resuming
again
the
serpentine
curves
of
course
from
the
with
is
supposed
to
be
a
hence
its
name
the
fibre
seems
in
color
and
texture
to
be
in
a
normal
condition
indeed
there
appear
to
be
little
or
no
pathological
symptoms
about
the
parts
at
all
except
a
slight
appearance
of
inflammation
over
the
surface
of
the
ulcer
which
is
more
apparent
sometimes
than
others
what
is
guinea
worm
i
have
examined
closely
this
fibre
and
from
its
appearance
color
size
and
texture
especially
as
it
is
sensibly
felt
high
up
in
the
leg
near
the
tuberosity
of
the
tibia
when
pulled
by
the
dangling
end
my
own
impression
is
that
the
guinea
worm
is
nothing
more
than
the
or
nerve
exposed
in
a
peculiar
manner
probably
by
a
disease
which
by
a
curious
pathological
process
absorbs
away
the
muscular
parts
leaving
the
bare
nerve
detached
at
its
lower
extremity
suspended
loose
in
this
unnatural
space
i
have
never
seen
but
this
one
case
of
guinea
worm
but
had
frequent
opportunities
of
examining
it
indeed
the
patient
consulted
me
concerning
it
and
by
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
very
clever
native
gentleman
samuel
crowther
who
received
his
professional
education
at
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
lincoln
inn
fields
london
insisted
on
my
taking
the
case
which
i
declined
partly
for
the
want
of
time
to
do
justice
to
the
patient
and
aside
from
courtesy
and
equity
to
the
surgeon
who
had
the
case
in
hand
mainly
because
i
nothing
about
the
best
reason
of
all
the
patient
was
an
american
quadroon
black
nearly
in
complexion
of
white
blood
from
north
carolina
this
of
course
was
a
black
quadroon
i
should
add
that
the
fiber
at
times
entirely
from
the
cavity
by
of
course
when
again
it
is
seen
suspended
as
before
this
is

reason
why
it
is

to
be

will
admit
as
often
as
thought
advisable
under

circumstances
i
have
thus
thought
proper
to
simplify
this
treatment
that
it
may
be
in
the
reach
of
every
person
going
to
the
tropics
as
i
am
certain
that
there
has
been
a
great
deficiency
in
the
treatment
and
discovery
of
remedies
in
diseases
of
that
continent
especially
these
prescriptions
as
compounded
are
entirely
new
originating
with
the
writer
who
has
only
to
add
that
he
is
in
hopes
that
they
prove
as
advantageous
and
successful
in
other
hands
as
they
have
been
in
his
regimen
persons
laboring
under
fever
should
eat
moderately
of
such
food
as
best
agrees
with
their
appetite
but
frequently
if
required
or
desired
that
the
system
may
be
well
supported
when
there
is
or
present
there
should
be
no
solid
food
taken
but
the
patient
or
ailing
person
should
be
confined
strictly
to
a
thin
milk
porridge
of
fine
flour
which
is
always
obtainable
in
africa
crumbled
crackers
or
soda
biscuits
light
leavened
wheat
bread
if
to
be
had
or
rice
boiled
to

the
as
a
porridge
with
milk
rather
aggravates
the
bowels
of
most
persons
therefore
whenever
it
is
found
to
have
this
effect
its
use
should
be
immediately
abandoned
in
many
instances
where
there
is
either
diarrhoea
or
dysentery
present
without
other
prominent
symptoms
i
have
found
the
mere
use
of
cooked
milk
merely
scalded
as
women
usually
term
it
being
heated
to
the
boiling
point
without
permitting
it
to
boil
taken
as
food
alone
to
be
the
only
remedy
required
hygiene
eating
the
laws
of
health
should
be
particularly
observed
in
going
to
africa
in
respect
to
eating
there
need
be
no
material
change
of
food
but
each
individual
observing
those
nourishments
which
best
agree
with
him
or
her
when
there
is
little
inclination
to
eat
eat
but
little
and
when
there
is
none
eat
nothing
i
am
certain
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
mortality
which
occurs
may
be
attributed
to
too
free
and
too
frequent
indulgence
in
eating
as
was
the
case
with
the
lewis
family
of
five
at
in
liberia
all
of
whom
died
from
that
cause
as
well
as
others
that
might
be
mentioned
coffee
air
fruits
so
soon
as
you
have
taken
your
bath
and
put
your
morning
wrapper
even
before
dressing
you
may
eat
one
or
more
sweet
oranges
then
take
a
cup
of
coffee
creamed
and
sweetened
or
not
to
your
taste
make
your
toilet
and
walk
out
and
take
the
cool
air
always
taking
your
umbrella
or
parasol
because
no
foreigner
until
by
a
long
residence
more
or
less
acclimated
can
expose
himself
with
impunity
to
a
tropical
sun
if
preferred
coffee
should
always
be
taken
with
cream
or
milk
and
sugar
because
it
is
then
less
irritating
to
the
stomach
one
of
the
symptoms
of
native
fever
is
said
to
be
irritability
of
the
hence
all
exciting
causes
to
irritation
of
that
part
should
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
such
fruits
as
best
agree
with
each
individual
should
be
most
indulged
in
indeed
all
others
for
the
time
should
be
dispensed
with
and
when
it
can
be
done
without
any
apparent
risk
to
the
person
a
little
fruit
of
some
kind
might
be
taken
every
day
by
each
new
comer
except
oranges
taken
as
directed
above
all
fruits
should
be
eaten
and
before
breakfast
the
fruits
of
the
country
have
been
described
in
another

let
your
habits
be
strictly
temperate

for
human
nature
sake
abstain
from
the
erroneous
idea
that
some
sort
of
malt
or
spirituous
drink
is
necessary
this
is
not
the
case
and
i
am
certain
that
much
of
the
disease
and
dire
mortality
charged
against
africa
as
a
land
of
pestilence
and
death
should
be
charged
against
the
christian
lands

produce

bad

destroy
those
who
go
to
africa
whenever
wine
brandy
whisky
gin
rum
or
pure
alcohol
are
required
as

no
one
will
object
to
its
use
but
in
all
cases
in
which
they
are
used
as
a

in
africa
i
have
no
hesitation
in
pronouncing
them
deleterious
to
the
system
the
best
british
porter
and
ale
may
in
convalescence
from
fever
be
used
to
advantage
as
a
tonic
because
of
the
bitter

farinaceous
substances
they
contain
not
otherwise
is
it
beneficial

the

this
wise
and
beneficent
arrangement
of

makes
this

beautifully
in

delightfully
pleasant

i
have
no
doubt
but
in

few

so

as
scientific

take

and
sanitary
measures
of

there
will
be
no
more
contingency
in
going
to
africa
than
any
other
known
foreign
country
i
am
certain
even
now
that
the
native
fever
of
africa
is
not
more
trying
upon
the
system
when
properly
treated
than
the
native
fever
of
canada
the
western
and
southern
states
and

of
the
united

of
america
dress
avoid
getting
wet
dress
should
be
regulated
according
to
the
feeling
with
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
clothing
but
i
think
it
advisable
that
adults
should
wear
flannel
thin
next
to
their
person
always
when
first
going
to
africa
it
gradually
absorbs
the
moisture
and
retaining
a
proper
degree
of
heat
thus
prevents
any
sudden
change
of
temperature
from
affecting
the
system
avoid
getting
wet
at
first
and
should
this
accidentally
happen
take
a
thoroughly
good
bath
rub
the
skin
dry
and
put
on
dry
clothes
and
for
two
or
three
hours
that
day
keep
out
of
the
sun
but
if
at
night
go
to
bed
but
when
it
so
happens
that
you
are
out
from
home
and
can
not
change
clothing
continue
to
exercise
until
the
clothes
dry
on
your
person
it
is
the
abstraction
of
heat
from
the
system
by
evaporation
of
water
from
the
clothing
which
does
the
mischief
in
such
cases
i
have
frequently
been
wet
to
saturation
in
africa
and
nothing
ever
occurred
from
it
by
pursuing
the
course
here
laid
down
always
sleep
in
clean
clothes
sanitary
measures
i
am
sure
i
need
inform
no
one
however
ignorant
that
all
measures
of
cleanliness
of
person
places
and
things
about
the
residences
contribute
largely
to
health
in
africa
as
in
other
countries
ventilation
of
houses
all
dwellings
should
be
during
the
as
well
as
day
and
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
as
in
liberia
where
every
settler
sleeps
with
every
part
of
his
house
closely
shut
doors
windows
and
all
that
it
is
deletereous
to
have
the
house
ventilated
during
the
evening
although
they
go
out
to
night
meetings
visit
each
other
in
the
evening
and
frequently
sit
on
their
porches
and
piazzas
till
a
late
hour
in
the
night
conversing
without
any
injurious
effects
whatever
roberts
and
i
think
mcgill
and
a
few
other
gentlemen
informed
me
that
their
sleeping
apartments
were
exceptions
to
the
custom
generally
in
liberia
this
stifling
custom
to
save
themselves
does
not
prevail
among
the
natives
of
africa
anywhere
nor
among
the
foreigners
anywhere
in
the
yoruba
country
that
i
am
aware
of
and
i
am
under
the
impression
that
it
was
the
result
of
fear
or
precaution
not
against
the
night
air
but
against
the
imaginary
and
sometimes
real
creeping
things
as
insects
and
reptiles
which
might
find
their
way
into
the
houses
at
night
test
of
night
air
while
in
liberia
i
have
traversed
rivers
in
an
open
boat
at
night
slept
beyond
the
kavalla
falls
in
open
native
houses
and
at
the
residence
of
rev
alexander
crummel
mount
vaughan
cape
palmas
i
slept
every
evening
while
there
with
both
window
and
door
as
ventilators
the
window
was
out
and
the
door
inside
in
abbeokuta
ijaye
oyo
and
ogbomoso
we
slept
every
night
with
ventilated
doors
and
windows
when
we
slept
at
all
in
a
house
but
in
illorin
we
always
slept
out
of
doors
by
preference
and
only
retired
to
repose
which
were
always
open
when
it
was
too
cool
to
sleep
out
as
our
bedding
consisted
only
of
a
native
mat
on
the
ground
and
a
calico
sheet
spread
over
us
and
i
should
here
make
acknowledgments
to
my
young
colleague
campbell
for
the
use
of
his
large
scotch
shawl
when
i
was
unwell
and
indeed
almost
during
our
entire
travel
it
being
to
me
a
great
accommodation
a
comfort
and
convenience
which
i
did
not
possess
test
of
exposure
i
have
started
two
and
three
hours
before
daybreak
laying
on
my
bed
in
an
open
canoe
ascending
the
ogun
river
at
different
times
during
the
six
days
journey
up
to
abbeokuta
campbell
and
myself
have
frequently
slept
out
in
open
courts
and
public
without
shed
or
piazza
covering
and
when
journeying
from
oyo
to
ibaddan
for
three
successive
evenings
i
lay
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
or
forest
on
a
single
native
mat
without
covering
the
entire
night
and
many
times
during
our
travels
we
arose
at
midnight
to
commence
our
journey
and
neither
of
us
ever
experienced
any
serious
inconvenience
from
it
improved
window
and
door
ventilation
that
houses
in
africa
may
be
properly
ventilated
during
the
night
without
annoyance
or
what
is
equally
as
bad
if
not
worse
the
continual
fear
and
imagination
of
the
approach
of
venomous
insects
creeping
things
and
reptiles
the
residents
should
adapt
them
to
the
place
and
circumstances
without
that
rigid
imitation
of
european
and
american
order
of
building
every
house
should
be
well
ventilated
with
windows
on
opposite
sides
of
the
rooms
when
and
wherever
this
is
practicable
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
doors
and
where
the
room
will
not
admit
of
opposite
windows
or
windows
at
least
on
two
sides
of
a
room
whether
opposite
or
otherwise
a
chimney
or
ventilating
flue
should
be
constructed
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
window
which
window
should
always
be
to
the
windward
so
as
to
have
a
continual
draught
or
current
of
fresh
air
persons
however
should
always
avoid
sitting
in
a
though
a
free
circulation
of
air
should
be
allowed
in
each
room
of
every
house
instead
of
with
glass
as
in
common
use
i
would
suggest
that
the
windows
have
a
sash
of
four
or
but
two
if
preferred
panels
to
each
window
two
upper
and
two
lower
or
one
upper
and
one
lower
or
one
lower
and
two
upper
which
would
make
a
neat
and
handsome
window
each
panel
or
space
for
panes
being
neatly
constructed
with
a
such
as
is
now
used
as
screens
during
summer
season
in
the
lower
part
of
parlor
windows
to
prevent
too
great
oxydization
or
too
rapid
decay
of
so
delicate
a
structure
as
the
wire
must
be
it
should
be
made
of
brass
copper
or
some
composition
which
would
not
readily
corrode
inside
or
outside
doors
of
the
same
material
made
to
close
and
open
like
the
venetian
jalousies
now
in
use
in
civilized
countries
would
be
found
very
convenient
and
add
much
to
the
comfort
and
health
of
dwellings
as
a
sanitary
measure
the
frames
of
the
panels
or
sashes
should
be
constructed
of
maple
cherry
walnut
or
mahogany
according
to
the
means
of
the
builder
and
elegance
of
the
building
as
these
articles
seasoned
are
not
only
more
neat
and
durable
but
from
their
solidity
are
less
liable
to
warp
or
shrink
this
would
afford
such
a
beautiful
and
safe
protection
to
every
dwelling
against
the
intrusion
of
all
and
every
living
thing
even
the
smallest
insect
while
a
full
and
free
circulation
of
fresh
air
would
be
allowed
that
a
residence
in
africa
would
become
attractive
and
desirable
instead
of
as
now
from
imagination
objectionable
sanitary
effects
of
ants
termites
and
drivers
a
word
about
ants
in
africa
so
much
talked
of
and
so
much
dreaded
will
legitimately
be
in
place
here
regarding
them
as
a
sanitary
means
provided
by
divine
providence
the
or
white
double
ant
shaped
like
two
ovals
somewhat
flattened
joined
together
by
a
cylinder
somewhat
smaller
in
the
middle
with
a
head
at
one
end
of
one
of
the
ovals
is
an
herbivorous
insect
and
much
abused
as
the
reputed
destroyers
of
books
papers
and
all
linen
or
muslin
clothing
they
feed
mainly
on
such
vegetable
matter
as
is
most
subject
to
decay
as
soft
wood
and
many
other
such
when
void
of
vitality
and
there
is
living
herbage
upon
which
they
feed
and
thereby
prove
a
blessing
to
a
country
with
a
superabundance
of
rank
vegetable
matter
it
is
often
asserted
that
they
destroy
whole
buildings
yet
i
have
never
seen
a
person
who
knew
of
such
a
disaster
by
them
although
they
may
attack
and
do
as
much
mischief
in
such
cases
at
times
as
the
of
america
and
in
regard
to
clothing
though
doubtless
there
have
been
instances
of
their
attack
upon
and
destruction
of
clothing
yet
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
there
is
no
one
piece
of
clothing
attacked
and
destroyed
by
these
creatures
to
ten
thousand
by
the
moths
which
get
into
the
factories
and
houses
in
civilized
countries
where
woolen
goods
are
kept
in
all
my
travels
in
africa
i
never
had
anything
attacked
by
the
termite
but
during
my
stay
of
seven
months
in
great
britain
i
had
a
suit
of
woolen
clothes
completely
eaten
up
by
moths
in
liverpool
drivers
drivers
as
every
person
already
knows
are
black
ants
whose
reputation
is
as
bad
for
attacking
living
animals
and
even
human
beings
as
the
termites
for
attacking
clothing
this
creature
like
its
white
cousin
is
also
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
as
a
sanitary
means
and
to
the
reverse
of
the
other
is
carnivorous
feeding
upon
all
flesh
whether
fresh
or
putrified
like
the
white
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
superabundance
of
vegetable
certainly
these
black
ants
were
designed
by
providence
to
destroy
the
excess
of
animal
life
which
in
the
nature
of
things
would
be
brought
forth
with
little
or
no
destruction
without
them
and
although
much
is
said
about
their
attacking
persons
i
will
venture
the
opinion
that
there
is
not
one
of
these
attacks
a
person
to
every
ten
thousand
musquitoes
in
america
as
it
is
only
by
chance
and
by
search
after
that
drivers
attack
persons
how
they
travel
they
usually
go
in
search
of
food
in
narrow
rows
say
from
half
an
inch
to
a
hand
breadth
as
swiftly
as
a
running
stream
of
water
and
may
in
their
search
enter
a
house
in
their
course
if
nothing
attract
them
around
it
when
in
such
cases
they
spread
over
the
floor
walls
and
ceiling
and
finding
no
insect
or
creeping
thing
to
destroy
they
gather
again
on
the
floor
and
leave
the
premises
in
the
regular
order
in
which
they
entered
should
they
encounter
a
person
when
on
these
excursions
though
in
bed
does
he
but
lie
still
and
not
disturb
them
the
negro
insects
will
even
pass
over
the
person
without
harm
or
molestation
but
if
disturbed
they
will
retaliate
by
a
sting
as
readily
as
a
bee
when
the
hive
is
disturbed
though
their
sting
so
far
from
being
either
dangerous
or
severe
is
simply
like
the
severe
sting
of
a
musquito
an
aged
missionary
gentleman
of
experience
informed
me
that
an
entire
myriad
this
term
is
given
to
a
multitude
of
drivers
as
their
number
can
never
be
less
than
ten
thousand
and
i
am
sure
that
i
have
seen
as
many
millions
together
passed
over
him
one
night
in
bed
without
one
stinging
him
indeed
both
the
black
and
white
ants
are
quite
harmless
as
to
personal
injury
and
very
beneficial
in
a
sanitary
point
how
to
drive
them
out
of
the
houses
there
is
much
more
in
the
imagination
than
the
reality
about
these
things
and
one
important
fact
i
must
not
omit
that
however
great
the
number
of
drivers
a
simple
set
in
the
middle
of
the
will
clear
the
room
of
them
in
ten
minutes
in
this
case
they
do
not
form
in
column
but
go
out
in
hasty
confusion
each
effecting
as
quick
retreat
and
safe
escape
for
himself
as
possible
forming
their
line
of
march
outside
of
the
house
where
they
meet
from
all
quarters
of
their
points
of
escape
how
to
destroy
them
of
or
common
salt
fine
slightly
damped
will
entirely
destroy
the
termites
and
or
vinegar
or
either
will
destroy
or
chase
off
the
drivers
these
means
are
simple
and
within
the
reach
of
every
person
but
aside
from
this
both
classes
or
races
of
these
creatures
disappear
before
the
approach
of
civilization
in
a
word
moths
mice
roaches
and
musquitoes
are
much
greater
domestic
annoyances
and
certainly
much
more
destructive
in
america
and
europe
than
the
or
driver
is
in
africa
their
pugnacious
and
martial
character
i
can
not
endorse
the
statement
from
personal
knowledge
of
the
desperate
hostility
which
the
drivers
manifest
towards
the
termites
as
given
by
livingstone
who
calling
them
black
rascals
says
they
stand
deliberately
and
watch
for
the
whites
which
on
coming
out
of
their
holes
they
instantly
seize
putting
them
to
death
perhaps
the
whites
were
in
which
case
they
served
the
white
right
though
i
have
never
seen
an
encounter
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
blacks
do
subdue
the
whites
whenever
they
meet
in
fact
they
go
as
do
no
other
creatures
known
to
natural
science
in
immense
incalculable
numbers
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
exaggerate
if
i
say
that
i
have
more
than
once
seen
more
than
six
hogsheads
of
them
traveling
together
had
they
been
measured
and
along
the
entire
line
of
march
stationed
on
each
side
of
the
columns
there
are
warriors
or
soldiers
to
guard
them
who
stand
sentry
closely
packed
side
by
side
with
their
heads
towards
the
column
which
passes
on
as
rapidly
as
a
flowing
stream
of
water
i
have
traced
a
column
for
more
than
a
mile
whose
greatest
breadth
was
more
than
a
yard
and
the
least
not
less
than
a
foot
it
is
inconceivable
the
distance
these
creatures
travel
in
a
short
time
should
anything
disturb
the
lines
the
soldiers
sally
out
a
few
feet
in
pursuit
of
the
cause
quickly
returning
to
their
post
when
meeting
no
foe
the
guards
are
much
larger
than
the
common
drivers
being
about
the
length
of
a
and
armed
with
a
pair
of
curved
horns
like
those
of
the
large
american
black
beetle
called
pinching
bug
there
are
no
here
cesspools
one
important
fact
never
referred
to
by
travellers
as
such
is
that
the
health
of
large
towns
in
africa
will
certainly
be
improved
by
the
erection
of
whereas
now
they
have
none
with
the
exception
of
the
residences
of
missionaries
and
other
civilized
people
there
is
no
such
thing
in
africa
every
family
as
in
civilized
countries
should
have
such
conveniences
our
senses
are
great
and
good
faculties
seeing
hearing
tasting
smelling
and
feeling
god
has
so
created
them
and
designed
them
for
such
purposes
therefore
they
should
neither
be
perverted
nor
marred
when
this
can
be
avoided
hence
we
should
beautify
when
required
and
make
pleasing
to
the
sight
modify
and
make
pleasant
to
the
hearing
and
to
make
to
the
smelling
improve
and
make
good
to
the
taste
and
never
violate
the
feelings
whenever
any
or
all
of
these
are
at
our
will
or
control
wild
beasts
and
reptiles
a
single
remark
about
these
the
wild
beasts
are
driven
back
before
the
march
of
civilization
i
having
seen
none
save
one
leopard
and
but
four
serpents
during
my
entire
travels
one
three
and
a
half
feet
long
a
water
snake
one
fourteen
inches
long
and
another
ten
inches
long
the
two
last
being
killed
by
natives
and
a
tame
one
around
the
neck
of
a
charmer
at
oyo
during
the
time
i
never
saw
a
centipede
and
but
two
tarantulas
x
missionary
influence
to
deny
or
overlook
the
fact
the
fact
that
the
missionary
influence
had
done
much
good
in
africa
would
be
simply
to
do
injustice
a
gross
injustice
to
a
good
cause
protestant
missionaries
the
advent
of
the
protestant
missionaries
into
africa
has
doubtless
been
effective
of
much
good
though
it
may
reasonably
be
expected
that
many
have
had
their
short
comings
by
protestant
i
mean
all
other
christian
denominations
than
the
roman
catholic
i
would
not
be
regarded
either
a
bigot
or
partialist
so
far
as
the
rights
of
humanity
are
concerned
but
facts
are
tenable
in
all
cases
and
whilst
i
readily
admit
that
a
protestant
monarch
granted
the
first
to
steal
africans
from
their
homes
to
be
enslaved
by
a
protestant
people
and
subsequently
a
protestant
nation
has
been
among
the
most
cruel
oppressors
of
the
african
race
my
numerous
friends
among
whom
are
many
roman
catholics
black
as
well
as
white
must
bear
the
test
of
truth
as
i
shall
apply
it
in
the
case
of
the
missionaries
as
my
object
in
visiting
my
fatherland
was
to
enquire
into
and
learn
every
fact
which
should
have
a
bearing
on
this
the
grandest
prospect
for
the
regeneration
of
a
people
that
ever
was
presented
in
the
history
of
the
world
influence
of
roman
catholic
religion
in
favor
of
slavery
in
my
entire
travels
in
africa
either
alone
or
after
meeting
with
campbell
at
abbeokuta
i
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
any
roman
catholic
missionaries
but
the
most
surprising
and
startling
fact
is
that
every
point
on
the
coast
at
present
which
ports
are
mainly
situated
south
and
east
where
the
traffic
is
carried
on
are
either
roman
catholic
or
native
agencies
protected
by
roman
catholics
as
canot
formerly
at
grand
cape
mount
pedro
blanco
and
domingo
at
wydah
in
dahomi
and
still
more
it
is
a
remarkable
and
very
suggestive
reality
that
at
all
of
those
places
where
the
jesuits
or
roman
catholic
missionaries
once
were
stationed
the
is
not
only
still
carried
on
in
its
worst
form
as
far
as
practicable
but
slaves
are
held
in
africa
by
these
white
foreigners
at
the
old
portuguese
settlements
along
the
southern
and
eastern
coasts
of
loango
and
mozambique
for
instance
and
although
some
three
years
have
elapsed
since
the
king
of
portugal
proclaimed
or
pretended
to
proclaim
liberty
to
all
the
people
throughout
his
dominions
yet
i
will
venture
an
opinion
that
not
one
in
every
hundred
of
native
africans
thus
held
in
bondage
on
their
own
soil
are
aware
of
any
such
proclamation
livingstone
tells
us
that
he
came
across
many
ruins
of
roman
catholic
missionary
stations
in
his
travels
especially
those
in
loando
de
paul
a
city
of
some
eighteen
or
twenty
thousand
of
a
population
all
deserted
and
the
buildings
appropriated
to
other
uses
as
and
the
like
does
not
this
seem
as
though
slavery
were
the
legitimate
successor
of
roman
catholicism
or
and
holders
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
and
missionaries
it
certainly
has
that
appearance
to
me
and
a
fact
still
more
glaring
is
that
the
only
professing
christian
government
which
in
the
light
of
the
present
period
of
human
elevation
and
national
reform
has
attempted
such
a
thing
is
that
of
roman
catholic
spain
still
persisting
in
holding
cuba
for
the
wealth
accruing
from
african
slaves
stolen
from
their
native
land
which
recently
expelled
every
protestant
missionary
from
the
african
island
of
fernando
po
that
they
might
command
it
unmolested
by
christian
influence
as
an
export
mart
for
the
african
to
these
facts
i
call
the
attention
of
the
christian
world
that
no
one
may
murmur
when
the
day
of
retribution
in
africa
comes
which
come
it
must
and
is
fast
hastening
when
must
flee
influence
of
protestant
religion
against
slavery
and
in
favor
of
civilization
wherever
the
protestant
missionaries
are
found
or
have
been
there
are
visible
evidences
of
a
purer
and
higher
civilization
by
the
high
estimate
set
upon
the
christian
religion
by
the
natives
the
deference
paid
to
the
missionaries
themselves
and
the
idea
which
generally
obtains
among
them
that
all
missionaries
are
opposed
to
slavery
and
the
faith
they
have
in
the
moral
integrity
of
these
militant
ambassadors
of
the
living
god
wherever
there
are
missionaries
there
are
schools
both
sabbath
and
secular
and
the
arts
and
sciences
and
manners
and
customs
more
or
less
of
civilized
life
are
imparted
i
have
not
as
yet
visited
a
missionary
station
in
any
part
of
africa
where
there
were
not
some
and
frequently
many
natives
both
adult
and
children
who
could
speak
read
and
write
english
as
well
as
read
their
own
language
as
all
of
them
whether
episcopalian
wesleyan
baptist
or
presbyterian
in
the
yoruba
country
have
crowther
editions
of
religious
and
secular
books
in
the
schools
and
churches
and
all
have
native
agents
interpreters
teachers
assistants
and
catechists
or
readers
in
the
mission
these
facts
prove
indisputably
great
progress
and
i
here
take
much
pleasure
in
recording
them
in
testimony
of
those
faithful
laborers
in
that
distant
vineyard
of
our
heavenly
father
in
my
fatherland
both
male
and
female
missionaries
all
seemed
much
devoted
to
their
work
and
anxiously
desirous
of
doing
more
indeed
the
very
fact
of
there
being
as
many
native
missionaries
as
there
are
now
to
be
found
holding
responsible
positions
as
elders
deacons
preachers
and
priests
among
whom
there
are
many
finely
educated
and
several
of
them
authors
of
works
not
only
in
their
own
but
the
english
language
as
revs
crowther
king
taylor
and
samuel
crowther
surgeon
all
show
that
there
is
an
advancement
for
these
people
beyond
the
point
to
which
missionary
duty
can
carry
them
kindness
of
missionaries
and
personal
acknowledgments
i
am
indebted
to
the
missionaries
generally
wherever
met
with
whether
in
liberia
or
central
africa
for
their
uniform
kindness
and
hospitality

a

but
a
desirable
one
hints
to
those
to
whom
they
apply
i
would
suggest
for
the
benefit
of
missionaries
in
general
and
those
to
whom
it
applies
in
particular
that
there
are
other
measures
and
ways
by
which
civilization
may
be
imparted
than
preaching
and
praying
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
means
if
all
persons
who
settle
among
the
natives
would
as
far
as
it
is
in
their
power
and
comes
within
their
province
induce
by
making
it
a
rule
of
their
house
or
family
every
native
servant
to
sit
on
a
stool
or
chair
eat
at
a
table
instead
of
on
the
ground
eat
with
a
knife
and
fork
or
with
a
spoon
instead
of
with
their
fingers
eat
in
the
house
instead
of
going
out
in
the
yard
garden
or
somewhere
else
under
a
tree
or
shed
and
sleep
on
a
bed
instead
of
on
a
bare
mat
on
the
ground
and
have
them
to
wear
some
sort
of
a
garment
to
cover
the
entire
person
above
the
knees
should
it
be
but
a
single
shirt
or
chemise
instead
of
a
loose
native
cloth
thrown
around
them
to
be
dropped
at
pleasure
at
any
moment
exposing
the
entire
upper
part
of
the
person
or
as
in
liberia
where
that
part
of
the
person
is
entirely
uncovered
i
am
certain
that
it
would
go
far
toward
impressing
them
with
some
of
the
habits
of
civilized
life
as
being
adapted
to
them
as
well
as
the
white
man
whom
they
so
faithfully
serve
with
a
will
i
know
that
some
may
say
this
is
difficult
to
do
it
certainly
could
not
have
been
with
those
who
never
tried
it
let
each
henceforth
resolve
for
himself
like
the
son
of
nun
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
changing
names
i
would
also
suggest
that
i
can
not
see
the
utility
of
the
custom
on
the
part
of
missionaries
in
the
names
of
native
children
and
even
adults
so
soon
as
they
go
into
their
families
to
live
as
though
their
own
were
not
good
enough
for
them
these
native
names
are
generally
much
more
significant
and
euphonious
than
the
saxon
gaelic
or
celtic
thus
adenigi
means
crowns
have
their
shadow
this
was
the
name
of
a
servant
boy
of
ours
whose
father
was
a
native
cotton
trader
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
custom
among
missionaries
and
other
christian
settlers
of
changing
the
names
of
the
natives
will
be
stopped
thereby
relieving
them
of
the
impression
that
to
embrace
the
christian
faith
implies
a
loss
of
name
and
so
far
loss
of
identity
xi
what
africa
now
requires
what
missionary
labor
has
done
from
the
foregoing
it
is
very
evident
that
missionary
duty
has
reached
its
by
this
i
mean
that
the
native
has
received
all
that
the
missionary
was
sent
to
teach
and
is
now
really
ready
for
more
than
he
can
or
may
receive
he
sees
and
knows
that
the
white
man
who
first
carried
him
the
gospel
which
he
has
learned
to
a
great
extent
to
believe
a
reality
is
of
an
entirely
different
race
to
himself
and
has
learned
to
look
upon
everything
which
he
has
knows
and
does
which
has
not
yet
been
imparted
to
him
especially
when
he
is
told
by
the
missionaries
which
frequently
must
be
the
case
to
relieve
themselves
of
the
endless
teasing
enquiries
which
persons
in
their
position
are
subject
to
concerning
all
and
every
temporal
and
secular
matter
law
government
commerce
military
and
other
matters
foreign
to
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
that
these
things
he
is
not
sent
to
teach
but
simply
the
gospel
as
peculiarly
adapted
and
belonging
to
the
white
man
of
course
there
are
exceptions
to
this
hence
having
reached
what
he
conceives
to
be
the
of
the
black
man
or
attainments
there
must
be
a
in
some
direction
and
if
not
progressive
it
will
be
retrogressive
how
it
was
done
the
missionary
has
informed
him
that
the
white
man
country
is
great
he
builds
and
resides
in
great
houses
lives
in
great
towns
and
cities
with
great
churches
and
public
and
legislative
halls
rides
in
great
carriages
manufactures
great
and
beautiful
things
has
great
ships
which
go
to
sea
to
all
parts
of
the
world
instead
of
little
canoes
such
as
he
has
paddling
up
and
down
the
rivers
and
on
the
coast
that
the
wisdom
power
strength
courage
and
wealth
of
the
white
man
and
his
country
are
as
much
greater
than
him
and
his
as
the
big
ships
are
larger
and
stronger
than
the
little
frail
canoes
all
of
which
he
is
made
sensible
of
either
by
the
exhibition
of
pictures
or
the
reality
the
result
if
not
timely
aided
by
legitimate
means
he
at
once
comes
to
a
stand
of
what
use
is
the
white
man
religion
and
knowledge
to
me
since
it
does
not
give
me
the
knowledge
and
wisdom
nor
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
white
man
as
all
these
things
belong
only
to
him
our
young
men
and
women
learn
their
book
and
talk
on
paper
write
and
talk
to
god
like
white
man
worship
but
god
no
hear
like
he
hear
white
man
dis
religion
no
use
to
black
man
and
so
the
african
reasons
when
he
sees
that
despite
his
having
yielded
up
customs
the
laws
of
his
fathers
and
almost
his
entire
social
authority
and
the
rule
of
his
household
to
the
care
and
guardianship
of
the
missionary
for
the
sake
of
acquiring
his
knowledge
and
power
when
after
having
learned
all
that
his
children
can
he
is
doomed
to
see
them
sink
right
back
into
their
old
habits
the
country
continue
in
the
same
condition
without
the
beautiful
improvements
of
the
white
man
and
if
a
change
take
place
at
all
he
is
doomed
to
witness
what
he
never
expected
to
see
and
dies
regretting
himself
and
people
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
the
government
of
a
people
foreign
in
kith
kin
and
sympathy
when
he
and
his
are
entirely
shoved
aside
and
compelled
to
take
subordinate
and
inferior
positions
if
not
indeed
reduced
to
menialism
and
bondage
i
am
justified
in
asserting
that
this
state
of
things
has
brought
missionary
efforts
to
their
and
native
progress
to
a
pause
missionary
aid
christianity
and
law
or
government
must
harmonize
to
be
effective
of
good
religion
has
done
its
work
and
now
requires
temporal
and
secular
aid
to
give
it
another
impulse
the
improved
arts
of
civilized
life
must
now
be
brought
to
bear
and
go
hand
in
hand
in
aid
of
the
missionary
efforts
which
are
purely
religious
in
character
and
teaching
i
would
not
have
the
standard
of
religion
lowered
a
single
stratum
of
the
common
breeze
of
heaven
no
let
it
rather
be
raised
if
indeed
higher
it
can
be
christianity
certainly
is
the
most
advanced
civilization
that
man
ever
attained
to
and
wherever
propagated
in
its
purity
to
be
effective
law
and
government
must
be
brought
in
harmony
with
it
otherwise
it
becomes
corrupted
and
a
corresponding
degeneracy
ensues
placing
its
votaries
even
in
a
worse
condition
than
the
primitive
this
was
exemplified
by
the
author
of
our
faith
who
so
soon
as
he
began
to
teach
commenced
by
admonishing
the
people
to
a
modification
of
their
laws
or
rather
himself
to
condemn
them
but
it
is
very
evident
that
the
social
must
keep
pace
with
the
religious
and
the
political
with
the
social
relations
of
society
to
carry
out
the
great
measures
of
the
higher
civilization
like
seeks
like
of
what
avail
then
is
advanced
intelligence
to
the
african
without
improved
social
relations
acquirements
and
refinement
without
an
opportunity
of
a
practical
application
of
them
society
in
which
they
are
appreciated
it
requires
not
the
most
astute
reformer
and
political
philosopher
to
see
natives
desire
higher
social
relations
the
native
sees
at
once
that
all
the
higher
social
relations
are
the
legitimate
result
and
requirements
of
a
higher
intelligence
and
naturally
enough
expects
that
when
he
has
attained
it
to
enjoy
the
same
privileges
and
blessings
but
how
sadly
mistaken
what
dire
disappointment
native
doubts
respecting
the
eventual
good
effects
of
missionary
labor
the
habits
manners
and
customs
of
his
people
and
the
social
relations
all
around
him
are
the
same
improvements
of
towns
cities
roads
and
methods
of
travel
are
the
same
implements
of
husbandry
and
industry
are
the
same
the
methods
of
conveyance
and
price
of
produce
with
comparative
trifling
variation
are
the
same
all
seem
dark
and
gloomy
for
the
future
and
he
has
his
doubts
and
fears
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
committed
a
fatal
error
in
leaving
his
native
social
relations
for
those
of
foreigners
whom
he
can
not
hope
to
emulate
and
who
he
thinks
will
not
assimilate
themselves
to
him
the
proper
element
as
progressive
missionary
agencies
it
is
clear
then
that
essential
to
the
success
of
civilization
is
the
establishment
of
all
those
social
relations
and
organizations
without
which
enlightened
communities
can
not
exist
to
be
successful
these
must
be
carried
out
by
proper
agencies
and
these
agencies
must
be
a
introduced
into
their
midst
possessing
all
the
attainments
socially
and
politically
morally
and
religiously
adequate
to
so
important
an
end
this
element
must
be
in
all
the
characteristics

sentiments
and
sympathies
the
of
being
the
only
element
that
can
effect
it
to
this
end

of

to
carry
out
these
most
desirable
measures
by
the

at
once
to
introduce
in
an
effective
manner
all
the

of

life
precaution
against
error
in
the
first
steps
that
no
be
taken
and
fatal
error
committed
at
the
commencement
we
have
determined
that
the
persons
to
compose
this
new
element
to
be
introduced
into
africa
shall
be
well
and
most
carefully
selected
in
regard
to
moral
integrity
intelligence
acquired
attainments
fitness
adaptation
and
as
far
as
practicable
religious
sentiments
and
professions
we
are
serious
in
this
and
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
as
an
individual
it
shall
be
restricted
to
the
letter
and
we
will
most
strenuously
oppose
and
set
our
face
against
any
attempt
from
any
quarter
to
infringe
upon
this
arrangement
and
design
africa
is
our
fatherland
and
we
its
legitimate
descendants
and
we
will
never
agree
nor
consent
to
see
this
the
first
voluntary
step
that
has
ever
been
taken
for
her
regeneration
by
her
own
descendants
blasted
by
a
disinterested
or
renegade
set
whose
only
object
might
be
in
the
one
case
to
get
rid
of
a
portion
of
the
colored
population
and
in
the
other
make
money
though
it
be
done
upon
the
destruction
of
every
hope
entertained
and
measure
introduced
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
great
and
prospectively
glorious
undertaking
we
can
not
and
will
not
permit
or
agree
that
the
result
of
years
of
labor
and
anxiety
shall
be
blasted
at
one
reckless
blow
by
those
who
have
never
spent
a
day
in
the
cause
of
our
race
or
know
nothing
about
our
wants
and
requirements
the
descendants
of
africa
in
north
america
will
doubtless
by
the
census

five

number
two

have
outgrown
long
since
the

and
with
them

also
outgrown
the
boundaries
of
their
claims
i
therefore
can
not
consent
to
sacrifice
the
prospects
of
two
hundred
millions
that
a
fraction
of
five
millions
may
be
benefitted
especially
since
the
measures
adopted
for
the
many
must
necessarily
benefit
the
few

to
the

africa
to
become
regenerated
must
have
a
national
character
and
her
position
among
the
existing
nations
of
the
earth
will
depend
mainly
upon
the
high
standard
she
may
gain
compared
with
them

the

the

palm

are
among
the
great

of
this

but
as
every
nation
to
be
potent
must
have
some
great
source
of
wealth
which
if
not
natural
must
be
artificial
so
africa
has
that
without
which
the
workshops
of
great
britain
would
become
deserted
and
the
general
commerce
of
the

materially
reduced
and
lagos
must
not

become

the
trade
of

now
amounts
to
more

two

ten

there
having
been

all
that
we
require
to
make
lagos
a
desirable
seaport
with
one
of
the
safest
harbors
in
the

for

the

in

are
very
fine

in

are
generally
of
good
size
frequently
large
and
finely
flavored
religious
and
philanthropic
means
as
a
religious
means
such
a
position
must
most
largely
contribute
by
not
only
giving
security
to
the
missionary
cause
but
by
the
actual
infusion
of
a
religious
social
element
permanently
among
the
natives
of
the
country
and
as
a
philanthropic
by
a
permanent
check
to
the
and
also
by
its
reflex
influence
on
american
slavery
not
only
thus
far
cutting
off
the
supply
but
also
by
superseding
slavery
in
the
growth
and
supply
of
those
articles
which
comprise
its
great
staple
and
source
of
wealth
thereby
tendering
slave
labor
and
as
the
succeeding
section
will
show
stopping
the
slave
trade
as
to
the
possibility
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
i
have
only
to
say
that
we
do
not
leave
america
and
go
to
africa
to
be
passive
spectators
of
such
a
policy
as
traffic
in
the
flesh
and
blood
of
our
kindred
nor
any
other
species
of
the
human
race
more
we
might
say
that
we
will
not
live
there
and
permit
it
is
the
first
law
of
nature
and
we
go
to
africa
to
be
otherwise
we
have
no
business
there
or
anywhere
else
in
my
opinion
we
will
bide
our
time
the
shall
not
continue
means
of
doing
it
another
important
point
of
attention
that
is
the
ceases
in
africa
wherever
enlightened
christian
civilization
gains
an
influence
and
as
to
the
strength
and
power
necessary
we
have
only
to
add
that
liberia
with
a
coast
frontier
of
seven
hundred
miles
and
a
sparse
population
which
at
the
present
only
numbers
fifteen
thousand
settlers
has
been
effective
in
putting
a
stop
to
that
infamous
traffic
along
her
entire
coast
and
i
here
record
with
pleasure
and
state
what
i
know
to
be
the
fact
and
but
simple
justice
to
as
antagonists
to
slavery
as
live
that
the
liberians
are
uncompromising
in
their
opposition
to
oppression
and
the
enslavement
of
their
race
or
any
other
part
of
the
human
family
i
speak
of
them
as
a
nation
or
people
and
ignore
entirely
their
iscariots
if
any
there
be
what
they
have
accomplished
with
less
means
we
by
the
help
of
providence
may
reasonably
expect
to
effect
with
more
what
they
did
with
little
we
may
do
with
much
and
i
speak
with
confidence
when
i
assert
that
if
we
in
this
new
position
but
do
and
act
as
we
are
fondly
looked
to
and
expected
as
i
most
fondly
hope
and
pray
god
that
by
a
prudent
discretionate
and
course
dependant
upon
him
we
may
nay
i
am
certain
we
will
do
i
am
sure
that
there
is
nothing
that
may
be
required
to
aid
in
the
prosecution
and
accomplishment
of
this
important
and
end
that
may
not
be
obtained
from
the
greatest
and
most
potent
christian
people
and
nation
that
ever
graced
the
world
there
is
no
aid
that
might
be
wanted
which
may
not
be
obtained
through
a
responsible
just
and
equitable
negotiation
subsidizing
the
king
of
dahomi
there
is
some
talk
by
christians
and
philanthropists
in
great
britain
of
subsidizing
the
king
of
dahomi
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
humanity
our
race
and
the
cause
of
progressive
civilization
this
most
injurious
measure
of
compensation
for
wrong
never
will
be
resorted
to
nor
attempted
to
make
such
an
offering
just
at
a
time
when
we
are
about
to
establish
a
policy
of
in
africa
which
may
by
example
and
precept
effectually
check
forever
the
nefarious
system
and
reform
the
character
of
these
people
would
be
to
offer
inducements
to
that
monster
to
continue
and
a
license
to
other
petty
chiefs
to
commence
the
traffic
in
human
beings
to
get
a
reward
of
subsidy

xiii
cotton
staple
natural
elements
to
produce
cotton
cotton
grows
profusely
in
all
this
part
of
africa
and
is
not
only
produced
naturally
but
extensively
cultivated
throughout
the
yoruba
country
the
soil
climate
and
the
people
are
the
three
natural
elements
combined
to
produce
this
indispensible
commodity
and
with
these
three
natural
agencies
no
other
part
of
the
world
can
compete
africans
the
only
reliable
producers
in
india
there
is
a
difficulty
and
great
expense
and
outlay
of
capital
required
to
obtain
it
in
australia
it
is
an
experiment
and
though
it
may
eventually
be
obtained
it
must
also
involve
an
immense
outlay
of
capital
and
a
long
time
before
an
adequate
supply
can
be
had
as
it
must
be
admitted
however
reluctantly
by
those
desirous
it
should
be
otherwise
that
the
african
as
has
been
justly
said
by
a
manchester
merchant
has
in
all
ages
in
all
parts
of
the
world
been
sought
to
raise
cotton
wherever
it
has
been
produced
serious
contingencies
and
uncertainty
in
american
cotton
supply
in
america
there
are
several
serious
contingencies
which
must
always
render
a
supply
of
cotton
from
that
quarter
problematical
and
doubtful
and
always
expensive
and
subject
to
sudden
unexpected
and
unjust
advances
in
prices
in
the
first
place
the
land
is
purchased
at
large
prices
secondly
the
people
to
work
it
thirdly
the
expense
of
supporting
the
people
with
the
contingencies
of
sickness
and
death
fourthly
the
uncertainty
of
climate
and
contingencies
of
frost
and
a
backward
season
and
consequent
late
or
unmatured
crop
fifthly
insubordination
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
which
is
not
improbable
at
any
time
sixthly
suspension
of
friendly
relations
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
lastly
a
rupture
between
the
american
states
themselves
which
i
think
no
one
will
be
disposed
now
to
consider
impossible
all
or
any
of
these
circumstances
combined
render
it
impossible
for
america
to
compete
with
africa
in
the
growth
and
sale
of
cotton
for
the
following
reasons
superior
advantages
of
africa
over
all
other
countries
in
the
production
of
cotton
firstly
landed
tenure
in
africa
is
free
the
occupant
selecting
as
much
as
he
can
cultivate
holding
it
so
long
as
he
uses
it
but
can
not
convey
it
to
another
secondly
the
people
all
being
free
can
be
hired
at
a
price
less
than
the
of
the
capital
invested
in
land
and
people
to
work
it
they
finding
their
own
food
which
is
the
custom
of
the
country
thirdly
there
are
no
contingencies
of
frost
or
irregular
weather
to
mar
or
blight
the
crop
and
fourthly
we
have
two
regular
crops
a
year
or
rather
one
continuous
crop
as
while
the
trees
are
full
of
pods
of
ripe
cotton
they
are
at
the
same
time
blooming
with
fresh
flowers
and
african
cotton
is
planted
only
every
seven
years
whilst
the
american
is
replanted
every
season
lastly
the
average
product
per
acre
on
the
best
mississippi
and
louisiana
cotton
plantations
in
america
is
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
the
average
per
acre
in
africa
a
hundred
per
cent
more
or
seven
hundred
pounds
as
the
african
soil
produces
two
crops
a
year
to
one
in
america
then
we
in

cost
of

at

cotton
as
before
stated
is
the
great

importance
of
the
african
race
in
the
social
and
political
relations
of
the
world
by
this
it
will
be
seen
and
admitted
that
the
african
occupies
a
much
more
important
place
in
the
social
and
political
element
of
the
world
than
that
which
has
heretofore
been
assigned
him
holding
the
balance
of
commercial
power
the
source
of
the
wealth
of
nations
in
his
hands
this
is
indisputably
true
undeniable
that
cotton
can
not
be
produced
without
negro
labor
and
skill
in
raising
it
the
african
race
sustains
great
britain
great
britain
alone
has
directly
engaged
in

manufacture
of
pure
fabrics
from
the
raw
material
five
millions
of
persons
more
of
the
population
depend
upon
this
commodity
indirectly
for
a
livelihood
the
population
i
include
in
this
calculation
ireland
being
estimated
at
we
have
then

or
of
the

of
this
great
nation
depending
upon
the
article
cotton
alone
for
subsistence
and
the
black
man
is
the
producer
of
the
raw
material
and
the
source
from
whence
it
comes
what
an
important
fact
to
impart
to
the
heretofore
despised
and
negro
race
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
other
great
nations
of
europe
as
france
for

with
her
extensive
manufactures
of
muslin
delaines
which
simply

more
or

and

of

the
negro

the
whites
able
to
sustain
themselves
if
the
negro
race
as

can
produce
cotton
as

in

enrich
white

who

they

home
trade
the
liberians
must
as
a
policy
as
much
as
possible
patronise
home
manufactured
and
home
produced
articles
instead
of
using
foreign
they
should
prefer
their
own
sugar
molasses
and
coffee
which
is
equal
to
that
produced
in
any
other
country
and
if
not
it
is
the
only
way
to
encourage
the
farmers
and
manufacturers
to
improve
them
the
coffee
of
liberia
is
equal
to
any
in
the
world
and
i
have
drunk
some
of
the
native
article
superior
in
strength
and
flavor
to
java
or
mocca
and
i
rather
solicit
competition
in
judgment
of
the
article
of
coffee
and
singular
as
it
may
appear
they
are
even
supplied
from
abroad
with
spices
and
condiments
although
their
own
country
as
also
all
africa
is
prolific
in
the
production
of
all
other
articles
as
allspice
ginger
pepper
black
and
red
mustard
and
everything
else
coast
trade
they
must
also
turn
their
attention
to
supplying
the
coast
settlements
with
sugar
and
molasses
and
everything
else
of
their
own
production
which
may
be
in
demand
lagos
and
the
missionary
stations
in
the
interior
now
consume
much
of
these
articles
the
greater
part
of
which
sugar
and
molasses
are
imported
from
england
and
america
this
trade
they
might
secure
in
a
short
time
without
successful
competition
because
many
of
the
liberia
merchants
now
own
vessels
and
the
firm
of
johnson
turpin
and
dunbar
own
a
fine
little
coasting
steamer
and
soon
they
will
be
able
to
undersell
the
foreigners
whilst
at
present
their
trade
of
these
articles
in
america
is
a
mere
through
the
benevolence
of
some
good
hearted
gentlemen
personal
of
theirs
who
receive
and
dispose
of
them
sugar
and
molasses
at
a
price
much
above
the
market
value
to
encourage
them
this
can
only
last
while
these
friends
continue
when
it
must
then
cease
to
succeed
as
a
state
or
nation
we
must
become

not
that

desired

not

that
we
did
not
desire

nothing
eleemosynary

that

to
such

went
so
that
it
was
to
some

the

was
mainly
colored
as
that
was
our

letting
each
choose

decide
that
which
was
for
primary
objects
of
the

society
to
these
sentiments
the
noblemen

gentlemen
all
cordially

heartily
agreed
establishing
their

as
we
understand
it
expressly
to
aid
the
emigration
of

our

the

with

of
friends
to
this

have
already
assisted

and
professor

two
colored
gentlemen
from

with
funds
to
enable

to
continue
their
labors
and
to
lay

pioneer
exploration
expedition
into

from
which

the
assistance
of
all
friends
to

as
opposed
to

and
slavery
is
earnestly
solicited
cotton

king
in
america
cotton

in
england
the
free
colored
people
of
america
are
said
to
be
looking
forward
to
their
ultimate
removal
from
the
united
states
and
are
anxiously
seeking
for
locations
suitable
for
their
final
settlement
in
africa
or
other
intertropical
regions
where
they
may
obtain
that
freedom
which
is
the
inherent
right
of
man
and
by
their
industry
acquire
adequate
independence
the
african
aid
society
has
been
formed
to
assist
this
movement
and
to
annihilate
the
slave
trade
by
encouraging
the
development
of
the
resources
of
those
countries
inhabited
by
the
african
races
generally
as
well
as
to
cause
african
free
labor
to
supersede
african
slavery
and
degradation
in
canada
west
no
less
than
colored
persons
flying
from
slavery
have
now
taken
refuge
willing
to
meet
the
rigors
of
the
climate
so
that
they
are
assured
of
personal
freedom
under
the
aegis
of
the
british
flag
from
the
enactments
lately
made
in
some
states
of
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
all
the
free
people
of
color
either
to
leave
the
country
or
to
be
again
reduced
to
a
state
of
slavery
a
considerable
addition
will
no
doubt
shortly
be
made
to
the
number
of
those
who
have
already
found
their
way
to
canada
while
from
physical
causes
canada
can
be
looked
upon
by
the
colored
only
as
a
city
of
refuge
great
britain
has
for
half
a
century
been
employing
physical
force
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
which
after
the
expenditure
of
upwards
of
forty
millions
sterling
and
the
noble
sacrifice
of
the
lives
of
some
of
the
best
and
bravest
of
her
sons
still
exists
it
is
but
just
to
state
that
the
exportation
of
slaves
from
africa
has
been
reduced
from
to
per
annum
by
the
persevering
effort
of
those
who
are
opposed
to
a
traffic
disgraceful
to
christianity
is
the
ultimate
object
of
those
who
are
opposed
to
this
traffic
its
suppression
or
its
annihilation
the
annihilation
of
the
slave
trade
and
slavery
in
africa
was
unquestionably
the
aim
of
the
philanthropists
who
originated
this
great
movement
the
experience
of
half
a
century
has
proved
that
physical
force
can
not
destroy
the
traffic
while
there
is
a
demand
for
slave
labor
diplomacy
must
be
baffled
in
its
efforts
to
oppose
this
traffic
while
the
profits
for
carrying
each
slave
from
the
continent
of
africa
to
the
island
of
cuba
amount
to
the
enormous
return
of
fourteen
hundred
percent
it
is
a
fact
that
the
same
quality
of
cotton
may
be
obtained
from
africa
for
twenty
millions
of
money
for
which
great
britain
pays
the
slaveholders
in
america
thirty
millions
per
annum
if
cotton
can
be
sold
in
the
liverpool
market
at
anything
less
than
per
the
slaveholders
in
america
will
cease
to
grow
what
under
altered
circumstances
would
be
unprofitable
cotton
of
middling
quality
which
is
in
the
greatest
demand
may
be
obtained
in
west
and
eastern
africa
at
per
lb
and
already
cotton
from
western
africa
liberia
has
been
sent
to
liverpool
there
and
sold
at
boston
in
the
united
states
at
a
less
cost
than
cotton
of
a
similar
quality
could
be
supplied
from
the
southern
states
of
the
union
the
executive
committee
feel
assured
that
the
peaceful
means
adopted
by
this
society
for
the
christian
civilization
of
the
african
races
require
only
the
advocacy
of
and
the
generally
to
be
responded
to
by
the
people
of
great
britain
the
horrors
of
the
slave
trade
as
perpetrated
on
the
continent
of
africa
and
during
the
middle
passage
can
only
be
put
an
end
to
by
the
establishment
of
a
lawful
and
a
lucrative
a
powerful
and
a
permanent
trade
between
this
country
and
africa
which
will
have
the
effect
of
destroying
the
slave
trade
spreading
the
gospel
of
christ
and
civilizing
the
african
races
for
this
purpose
the
support
of
the
mercantile
class
is
earnestly
solicited
for
a
movement
which
commenced
by
the
colored
people
of
america
flying
from
oppression
bids
fair
to
open
new
cotton
fields
for
the
supply
of
british
industry
and
new
markets
for
our
commerce
realizing
the
sublime
promise
of
scripture
cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
and
after
many
days
it
shall
return
unto
thee
alarmists
point
to
the
sparks
in
the
cotton
fields
of
america
while
thoughtful
men
reflect
that
the
commercial
prosperity
of
this
great
country
hangs
upon
a
thread
of
cotton
which
a
blight
of
the
plant
an
insurrection
among
the
slaves
an
untimely
frost
or
an
increased
demand
in
the
northern
states
of
the
union
might
destroy
bringing
to
lancashire
first
and
then
to
the
whole
kingdom
a
return
of
the
irish
famine
of
which
reduced
the
population
of
that
portion
of
the
kingdom
from
eight
to
six
millions
the
southern
states
of
the
american
union
are
following
the
example
of
the
infatuated
louis
the
fourteenth
of
france
as
he
drove
into
exile
thousands
of
his
subjects
engaged
in
manufactures
and
trade
who
sought
refuge
in
england
and
laid
the
foundation
of
our
manufacturing
supremacy
so
are
the
slave
states
now
driving
from
their
confines
thousands
of
freed
colored
men
where
are
the
exiles
to
go
the
free
states
are
too
crowded
and
canada
too
cold
for
them
can
we
not
offer
them
an
asylum
in
jamaica
and
other
colonies
they
are
the
cream
the
best
of
their
race
for
it
is
by
industry
and
economy
that
they
have
been
enabled
to
purchase
their
freedom
and
joyfully
will
they
seize
the
hand
of
deliverance
which
great
britain
holds
out
to
them
we
only
want
additional
labor
give
us
that
and
we
shall
very
soon
cultivate
our
own
society
in
canada
at
a
meeting
held
in
the
town
hall
manchester
on
the
of
august
the
following
remarks
were
made
by
thomas
clegg
who
presided
on
the
occasion
the
chairman
said
that
they
held
but
one
opinion
as
to
the
horrors
and
evils
of
slavery
and
he
thought
that
most
of
them
believed
that
one
of
the
great
benefits
which
would
result
from
africans
trained
in
canada
being
sent
to
africa
would
be
that
they
could
there
for
the
advantage
of
themselves
and
their
country
grow
cotton
sugar
and
fifty
other
articles
which
we
much
needed
during
his
first
year
operations
in
getting
cotton
from
africa
all
his
efforts
only
purchased
lbs
but
in
he
got
lbs
and
he
saw
from
one
of
the
london
papers
of
the
previous
day
that
not
less
than
bales
or
were
received
from
the
west
coast
during
this
rapid
increase
in
the
early
history
of
the
movement
showed
that
africa
was
the
place
that
could
grow
cotton
and
that
africans
were
the
men
who
ought
to
grow
it
hear
hear
there
was
no
part
of
africa
of
which
he
had
heard
where
cotton
did
not
grow
wild
there
was
no
part
of
the
world
except
india
perhaps
in
which
cotton
was
cultivated
where
it
was
not
sought
to
obtain
africans
as
cultivators
wild
african
cotton
was
worth
from
to
a
pound
more
than
the
wild
produce
of
india
cultivated
cotton
from
the
west
coast
was
worth
on
an
average
as
much
as
new
orleans
possibly
could
be
hear
hear
he
would
undertake
that
good
african
cotton
could
be
laid
down
free
in
liverpool
at
per
pound
that
it
should
be
equal
to
new
orleans
and
at
this
moment
such
cotton
was
worth
probably
per
pound
hear
hear
he
looked
upon
this
question
as
affecting
not
only
the
success
of
missions
but
as
affecting
also
the
eternal
welfare
of
the
africans
and
the
temporal
welfare
of
our
people

i
received
while
at
brighton
the
following
letter
which
indicates
somewhat
the
importance
of
our
project
and
shows
in
a
measure
the
superiority
of
the
people
in
our
part
of
africa
and
what
may
be
expected
of
them
compared
with
some
in
other

and
how
the
portuguese
influence
has
ruined
them

was
then
on
a
visit
to
his
relatives
delaney
brighton
august
my
dear
sir
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
obliged
to
leave
brighton
before
you
deliver
your
lectures
and
as
we
may
not
meet
again
i
thought
i
would
write
you
a
few
lines
just
to
revive
the
subject
that
was
passing
our
minds
yesterday
i
can
not
but
think
if
it
were
practicable
for
a
few
thousands
or
even
hundreds
of
your
west
coast
men
to
come
round
to
the
east
coast
that
is
to
port
natal
an
immense
amount
of
good
would
be
derived
therefrom
not
only
in
assisting
to
abolish
the
barbarous
customs
of
our
natives
in
showing
them
that
labor
is
honorable
for
man
but
that
the
english
population
would
appreciate
their
services
and
that
they
would
be
able
to
get
good
wages
what
we
want
is
constant
and
reliable
laborers
not
those
who
come
by
fits
and
starts
just
to
work
for
a
month
and
then
be
off
they
must
select
their
masters
and
then
make
an
engagement
for
twelve
months
or
it
might
be
after
a
month
on
approval
good
laborers
could
get
fifteen
shillings
per
month
and
as
their
services
increased
in
value
they
would
get
twenty
shillings
and
their
allowance
of
food
which
is
always
abundant
i
have
thought
that
some
might
work
their
passage
down
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
some
of
her
majesty
and
from
there
they
might
work
their
passage
in
some
of
the
coasting
vessels
that
are
continually
plying
backwards
and
forwards
my
farm
is
only
five
miles
from
the
port
should
any
ever
come
from
your
representations
direct
them
to
me
and
should
i
not
require
them
myself
i
will
give
them
such
information
as
may
lead
them
to
find
good
masters
i
have
always
said
that
natal
is
the
key
to
the
civilization
of
south
africa
but
however
there
are
sometimes
two
keys
to
a
door
and
yours
on
the
west
though
a
little
north
of
the
line
may
be
the
other
and
by
god
blessing
i
trust
that
the
nations
of
the
east
and
west
may
before
long
meet
in
central
africa
not
in
hostile
array
as
african
nations
always
have
done
but
in
the
bonds
of
christian
fellowship
wishing
you
every
success
in
your
enterprize
believe
me
dear
sir
yours
most
sincerely

as

informed
me
that
those

think

be

worse

the
deficiency
of

could
be

but
the
destruction

remarks
in
the

upon

were

by
a
great
knowledge

genuine
modesty
he

a
physician
of

educated
in

who
has
revisited
the
lands
of
his
ancestry
and
proposes
a
most
reasonable
and
feasible
plan
to
destroy
the
slave
trade
by
creating
a
or
fringe
of
native
civilization
through
which

by
specimens
of

highly
curious
of
his

at

and
other
places
we
have
read
lengthy
reports
which
represent
the
influence
these
addresses
have
produced
and
which
speak
in
eulogistic
terms
of
delany
matter
and
manner
the
subject
is
one
of
vast
importance
to
england
and
we
trust
that
we
may
witness
ere
long
a
proper
appreciation
of
it
from

all
this
betokens
a
considerable

in

for
opening
out
the
resources
of
a
vast
portion
of
the
continent
of
africa
has
been
made
by
some
of
the
most
intelligent
colored
people
of
the
united
states
and
canada
having
formed
a
society
with
this
object
in
view
among
others
delany
and

campbell
were
commissioned
to
go
out
and
explore
a
considerable
portion
of
western
africa
near
to
the
mouths
of
the
niger
and
not
far
from
the
equator
a
report
of
this
expedition
is
in
progress
by
delany
who
is
himself
so
fully
convinced
of
the
advantages
which
the
rich
resources
of
that
part
of
africa
offer
that
he
has
concluded
to
remove
his
family
there
immediately
a
meeting
of
the
leeds
committee
was
held
on
wednesday
night
wm
scholefield
in
the
chair
when
valuable
information
was
communicated
by
delany
and
william
howard
day
from
canada
who
is
connected
with
this
movement
the
following
summary
of
their
remarks
will
be
found
of
deep
interest
wm
howard
day
having
been
called
upon
pointed
out
the
necessity
for
an
active
organization
in
this
country
as
was
so
well
expressed
by
the
chairman
to
keep
the
heart
of
the
english
people
warm
upon
the
subject
of
human
bondage
by
the
production
of
cotton
slavery
began
to
be
a
power
so
that
as
the
cotton
interest
increased
the
testimony
of
the
church
decreased
cotton
now
is
of
the
production
of
the
south
so
that
the
hon
amasa
walker
formerly
republican
secretary
of
state
for
the
state
of
massachusetts
at
the
meeting
held
in
london
august
and
presided
over
by
lord
brougham
really
expressed
the
whole
truth
when
he
said
while
cotton
is
fourteen
cents
per
pound
slavery
will
never
end
now
we
propose
to
break
the
back
of
this
monopoly
in
america
by
raising
in
africa
in
the
african
own
home
as
well
as
in
the
west
indies
cotton
of
the
same
quality
as
the
american
and
at
a
cheaper
rate
it
had
been
demonstrated
by
clegg
of
manchester
that
cotton
of
superior
quality
could
be
laid
down
at
liverpool
cheaper
from
africa
than
america
we
have
sent
my
friend
delany
to
see
what
africa
is
and
he
will
tell
you
the
results
so
very
favorable
of
his
exploration
then
we
feel
that
we
have
in
canada
the
colored
men
to
pioneer
the
way
men
reared
among
the
cotton
of
the
united
states
and
who
have
found
an
asylum
among
us
the
bone
and
sinew
is
in
africa
we
wish
to
give
it
direction
we
wish
thereby
to
save
to
england
millions
of
pounds
by
the
difference
in
price
between
the
two
cottons
we
wish
to
ward
off
the
blow
to
england
which
must
be
felt
by
four
millions
of
people
interested
in
the
article
to
be
produced
if
an
untimely
frost
or
an
insurrection
should
take
place
and
above
all
to
lift
up
africa
by
means
of
her
own
children
after
speaking
of
the
organization
among
the
colored
people
which
sent
out
delany
and
of
which
day
is
president
he
said
one
of
the
means
to
secure
these
ends
was
the
establishment
of
a
press
upon
a
proper
footing
in
canada
among
the
fugitive
slaves
and
to
collect
for
that
is
now
his
especial
work
it
would
aid
powerfully
it
was
hoped
in
another
way
already
american
prejudice
has
rolled
in
upon
the
borders
of
canada
so
that
schoolhouse
doors
are
closed
in
the
faces
of
colored
children
and
colored
men
denied
a
place
upon
juries
merely
because
of
their
color
it
was
with
difficulty
that
last
year
even
in
canada
they
were
able
to
secure
the
freedom
of
a
kidnapped
little
boy
who
was
being
dragged
through
the
province
to
be
sold
in
the
of
louis
in
view
of
all
these
points
hastily
presented
he
asked
the
good
will
and
active
aid
of
all
the
friends
of
liberty
delany
whose
name
has
become
so
celebrated
in
connection
with
the
statistical
congress
was
invited
to
state
what
he
had
contemplated
in
going
to
africa
and
if
he
would
kindly
do
so
what
he
had
discovered
there
delany
first
dwelt
upon
the
expectation
which
had
been
raised
in
his
mind
when
a
young
man
and
in
the
minds
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
by
the
beginning
of
the
work
there
by
william
lloyd
garrison
and
his
coadjutors
they
had
found
however
that
all
the
people
were
not
of
the
stamp
of
garrison
who
he
was
proud
to
say
believed
in
giving
to
colored
men
just
the
same
rights
and
privileges
as
to
others
and
that
garrison
idea
had
not
by
the
professed
friends
of
the
black
man
been
reduced
to
practice
and
finding
that
was
the
best
dependence
he
and
others
had
struck
out
a
path
for
themselves
after
speaking
of
the
convention
of
colored
people
which
he
and
others
called
in
to
consider
this
subject
of
and
of
the
general
organization
which
began
then
and
in
which
day
succeeded
him
as
president
he
said
he
went
to
africa
to
find
a
locality
suitable
for
a
select
emigration
of
colored
people
if
possible
a
large
region
and
with
a
situation
accessible
by
civilization
all
this
he
had
found
with
in
addition
a
and
industrious
people
the
facts
which
delany
grouped
together
as
to
the
climate
and
soil
as
to
productions
and
trade
as
to
the
readiness
of
the
people
to
take
hold
of
these
higher
ideas
and
as
to
the
anxiety
of
the
people
to
have
him
and
his
party
return
were
new
and
thrilling
an
interesting
conversation
ensued
on
the
points
brought
forward
and
the
following
minute
moved
by
wilson
armistead
and
seconded
by
the
rev
dr
brewer
was
unanimously
passed
that
the
thanks
of
this
meeting
be
tendered
to
delany
and
wm
howard
day
for
the
valuable
information
received
from
them
with
an
ardent
desire
that
their
plans
for
the
elevation
of
their
race
may
be
crowned
with
success
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
they
be
made
materially
to
hasten
the
extinction
of
the
and
slavery
character
of
commercial
relations
the
commercial
relations
entered
into
in
scotland
are
with

in

among
whom
are
henry
dunlop

of

i
have
negotiated
for
an
immediate
active
and
practical
prosecution
of
our
enterprise
and
whose
agency
in
europe
for
any
or
all
of
our
produce
may
be
fully
relied
on
i
speak
from
personal
acquaintance
with
these
gentlemen
reliable
arrangements
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
such
an
adventure
as
this
is
to
have
reliable
foreign
agencies
and
these
have
been
fully
secured
as
whilst
these
gentlemen
as
should
all
business
men
deal
with
us
only
on
business
terms
yet
they
have
entered
into
the
matter
as
much
as
christians
and
philanthropists
to
see
truth
and
right
prevail
whereby
humanity
may
be
elevated
as
for
anything
else
because
they
are
already
wealthy
and
had
they
been
seeking
after
wealth
they
certainly
could
and
would
have
sought
some
more
certainly
immediate

commences
about
the
middle
or
last
of
april
ending
near
or
about
the
first
of
november
by
going
during
this
period
it
will
be
observed
that
you
have
no
sudden
transition
from
cold
to
heat
as
would
be
the
case
did
you
leave
in
cold
weather
for
that
country
but
the
most
favorable
time
to
avoid
the
at
lagos
is
from
the
first
of
october
to
the
first
of
april
when
the
surges
in
the
roadstead
are
comparatively
small
and
not
imminently
dangerous
and
i
here
advise
and
caution
all
persons
intending
to
land
there
not
to
venture
over
the
surf
of
the
bar
in
one
of
those
native
canoes
safety
in
landing
yet
persons
can
land
with
safety
at
any
season
of
the
year
but
for
this
there
must
be
a
proper
boat
any
person
going
there
at
present
ought
not
to
land
if
the
surf
is
high
without
davies
large
which
is
as
safe
as
a
tug
and
rides
the
sea
like
a
swan
send
him
word
to
send
his
boat
at
the
best
hour
for
the
captain
is
a
native
merchant
and
most
obliging
gentleman
a
tender
so
soon
as
we
get
a
tender
called
in
america
and
which
will
be
one
of
the
first
things
done
so
soon
as
we
get
to
lagos
landing
will
be
as
safe
at
any
and
all
times
there
as
in
the
harbor
at
new
york
or
liverpool
for
the
information
of
many
intelligent
persons
who
are
not
aware
of
it
i
would
state
that
a
pilot
or
tender
has
to
take
vessels
into
both
of
these
great
seaports
on
account
of
shoal
water
rainy
season
the
rainy
season
usually
thought
by
foreigners
to
be
wet
muddy
and
disagreeable
weather
so
far
from
this
is
the
most
agreeable
season
of
the
year
instead
of
steady
rains
for
several
days
incessantly
as
is
common
during
rainy
weather
in
the
temperate
zones
there
is
seldom
or
never
rain
during
a
whole
day
but
every
day
to
a
certainty
during
this
season
it
rains
sometimes
by
showers
at
intervals
and
sometimes
a
heavy
rain
for
one
two
or
three
hours
at
a
time
but
seldom
so
long
as
three
hours
when
it
clears
up
beautifully
leaving
an
almost
cloudless
sky
the
rains
usually
come
up
very
suddenly
and
as
quickly
cease
when
done
drizzling
rain
sudden
showers
there
is
seldom
or
never
such
a
thing
in
this
part
of
africa
as
a
drizzling
or
mizzling
rain
all
suddenly
coming
on
and
as
suddenly
passing
off
and
should
one
be
out
and
see
indications
of
an
approaching
rain
they
must
hurry
to
a
near
shelter
so
suddenly
does
the
shower
come
on
tornadoes
tornadoes
are
sudden
gusts
or
violent
storms
of
wind
and
rain
which
are
more
or
less
feared
but
which
may
always
be
known
from
other
storms
on
their
approach
by
the
blackness
of
the
clouds
above
with
the
of
a
circle
of
lighter
just
beneath
the
dark
and
above
the
horizon
summer
the
entire
season
may
be
justly
termed
the
instead
of
winter
as
the
old
writers
have
it
and
it
is
observable
that
at
the
commencement
of
spring
in
the
temperate
zones
march
vegetation
starts
forth
in
africa
with
renewed
vigor
winter
is
during
the
season
and
not
the
wet
for
the
above
reason
and
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
during
autumn
in
the
temperate
zone
from
october
to
the
last
of
november
the
foliage
in
africa
begins
to
fade
and
fall
from
the
trees
in
large
quantities
harmattans
it
is
during
this
season
that
the
prevail
from
two
to
three
weeks
in
december
which
consist
of
a
and
a
dry
hot
wind
as
we
have
been
taught
when
furniture
and
and
for
want
of
moisture
and
the
thermometer
frequently
rates
as
low
as
deg
fahr
in
the
evening
and
early
in
the
morning
when
blankets
on
the
bed
will
not
be
out
of
place
and
an
evening
and
morning
fire
may
add
to
your
comfort
footnotes
i
have
received
information
from
london
that
an
iron
steam
tender
has
already
been
sent
out
to
lagos
by
an
english
house
xvii
concluding
suggestions
native
mariners
it
may
not
be
generally
known
as
a
fact
which
is
of
no
little
importance
in
the
industrial
economy
of
africa
that
vessels
of
every
class
of
all
foreign
nations
are
manned
and
managed
by
native
africans
so
soon
as
they
enter
african
waters
the
krumen
are
the
watermen
or
marines
generally
of
africa
going
in
companies
of
greater
or
less
numbers
with
one
in
the
lead
called
headman
who
hiring
all
the
others
makes
contracts
with
a
vessel
which
is
met
outside
of
the
roadsteads
or
harbors
to
supply
a
certain
number
of
men
to
manage
it
during
her
coasting
voyage
they
usually
bring
with
them
the
recommendations
of
all
the
commanders
whose
vessels
they
have
managed
on
the
coast
these
are
generally
carried
in
the
hat
to
prevent
getting
wet
and
sometimes
in
calabashes
stopped
up
like
a
bottle
or
in
a
tin
can
or
case
when
such
can
be
obtained
suspended
by
a
string
like
a
great
square
medal
around
the
neck
so
expert
have
these
people
become
in
marine
affairs
that
with
the
exception
of
navigation
a
vessel
at
sea
might
be
managed
entirely
by
many
of
those
companies
of
krumen
everything
that
is
to
be
done
as
the
common
work
of
seamen
is
done
by
them
during
their
engagement
on
the
coasting
vessels
the
agility
with
which
they
scale
the
shrouds
and
rigging
mounting
frequently
to
the
very
pinnacle
of
the
head
or
going
out
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
yard
arms
is
truly
surprising
in
these
feats
they
are
far
more
dextrous
than
the
white
civilians
the
fever
stages
of
in
cases
of
real
intermittent
fever
fever
and
ague
or
chills
and
fever
there
are
usually
three
distinct
stages
when
the
attack
comes
on
on
what
is
usually
termed
the
or
shivering
stage
the
or
burning
stage
succeeded
by
the
so
soon
as
there
are
symptoms
of
a
chill
a
cup
of
quite
hot
ginger
or
cinnamon
tea
not
too
strong
may
be
taken
the
person
keeping
out
of
the
sun
and
if
inclined
going
to
bed
and
covering
warmly
he
should
always
undress
putting
on
a
or
gown
for
the
convenience
of
changing
when
required
a
hot
cup
of
tea
of
any
kind
is
better
than
nothing
when
neither
cinnamon
nor
ginger
is
convenient
or
hot
during
the
hot
stage
the
person
must
be
kept
as
cool
as
possible
and
when
the
fever
is
at
its
height
and
indeed
it
is
well
to
commence
long
before
this
the
entire
person
from
head
to
foot
should
be
continually
bathed
by
a
free
application
of
cold
water
used
and
during
the
application
with
a
large
sponge
napkin
or
cloth
of
some
kind
an
excellent
addition
to
the
water
is
the
juice
of
limes
or
lemons
and
of
the
first
lime
than
the
last
is
required
because
of
the
superior
strength
of
the
one
to
the
other
soda
may
also
be
used
in
the
bath
as
an
adjuvant
to
the
water
not
with
the
lime
juice
of
course
because
they
would
effervesce
or
disagree
when
lime
or
lemon
juice
is
used
care
should
be
taken
in
the
use
of
it
that
it
be
not
too
strong
say
use
two
lemons
or
one
and
a
half
limes
if
large
to
a
pail
of
water
as
it
will
produce
irritation
on
all
of
the
tender
parts
of
the
person
and
even
over
the
general
surface
a
lime
bath
once
or
twice
a
week
in
the
absence
of
all
fever
is
said
to
be
an
excellent
hygeian
or
prophylactic
treatment
but
by
all
means
do
neglect
the
cold
water
application
during
the
hot
stage
so
soon
as
the
sweating
commences
the
patient
must
have
sufficient
covering
to
prevent
taking
cold
which
is
then
very
readily
done
in
consequence
of
the
general
relaxation
of
the
system
and
open
state
of
the
pores
when
the
sweating
ceases
the
shirt
or
gown
must
be
immediately
taken
off
the
entire
person
sponged
off
in
clear
lukewarm
or
water
fresh
clean
clothes
put
on
the
sheets
and
wet
removed
by
clean
ones
supplying
their
places
and
in
no
case
must
a
person
ever
be
permitted
to
keep
on
the
same
clothes
after
the
sweating
stage
as
the
or
is
expelled
through
the
medium
of
the
sweat
and
pores
and
consequently
absorbed
by
the
clothing
the
clothes
should
be
changed
whether
there
be
perspiration
or
not
the
either
of
these
symptoms
is
to
be
treated
as
advised
independently
of
the
other
in
the
order
of
arrangement
caution
persons
should
be
careful
not
to
sleep
in
sweaty
clothes
especially
those
in
which
they
have
traveled
and
they
should
be
cautious
not
to
sleep
in
the
same
clothes
worn
on
any
day
as
before
but
slightly
alluded
to
clean
unsoiled
should
be
put
on
every
evening
and
those
which
may
be
worn
again
should
be
well
aired
and
sunned
during
the
day
colonization
an
error
in
philanthropy
the
colonization
society
has
committed
a
great
error
in
its
philanthropic
arrangements
of
providing
for
months
after
going
to
africa
the
for
those
who
require
i
do
not
object
to
but
the
is
fatally
injurious
activity
conducive
to
health
instead
of
going
to
africa
and
quietly
sitting
down
in
utter
idleness
in
anticipation
in
anxious
expectation
for
the
fever
to
in
which
cases
the
person
becomes
much
more
susceptible
did
they
go
directly
about
some
active
employment
to
keep
both
mind
and
body
properly
exercised
i
am
certain
that
there
would
not
be
of
the
mortality
that
there
is
even
now
which
is
comparatively
little
evidences
of
the
fact
this
will
account
for
the
reason
that
among
the
numerous
travelers
and
explorers
who
visit
such
countries
there
is
so
much
less
nay
so
seldom
any
mortality
from
disease
compared
with
the
missionaries
whose
lives
are
rather
easy
and
inactive
except
the
really
energetic
ones
who
generally
are
they
who
survive
and
i
have
the
testimony
of
my
friends

industrious

who
corroborate
my
opinion
on
this
important
subject
indeed
the
people
generally
seem
to
have
been
long
conscious
of
this
fact
since
among
them
they
have
an
adage
the
work
the
fever
but
no
one
should
infer
that
it
meant
that
they
should
exercise
without

to
care
