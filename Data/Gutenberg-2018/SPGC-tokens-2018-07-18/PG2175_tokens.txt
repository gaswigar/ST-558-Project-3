you
never
can
tell
by
george
bernard
shaw
act
i
in
a
dentist
operating
room
on
a
fine
august
morning
in
not
the
usual
tiny
london
den
but
the
best
sitting
room
of
a
furnished
lodging
in
a
terrace
on
the
sea
front
at
a
fashionable
watering
place
the
operating
chair
with
a
gas
pump
and
cylinder
beside
it
is
half
way
between
the
centre
of
the
room
and
one
of
the
corners
if
you
look
into
the
room
through
the
window
which
lights
it
you
will
see
the
fireplace
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
opposite
you
with
the
door
beside
it
to
your
left
an
diploma
in
a
frame
hung
on
the
chimneypiece
an
easy
chair
covered
in
black
leather
on
the
hearth
a
neat
stool
and
bench
with
vice
tools
and
a
mortar
and
pestle
in
the
corner
to
the
right
near
this
bench
stands
a
slender
machine
like
a
whip
provided
with
a
stand
a
pedal
and
an
exaggerated
winch
recognising
this
as
a
dental
drill
you
shudder
and
look
away
to
your
left
where
you
can
see
another
window
underneath
which
stands
a
writing
table
with
a
blotter
and
a
diary
on
it
and
a
chair
next
the
writing
table
towards
the
door
is
a
leather
covered
sofa
the
opposite
wall
close
on
your
right
is
occupied
mostly
by
a
bookcase
the
operating
chair
is
under
your
nose
facing
you
with
the
cabinet
of
instruments
handy
to
it
on
your
left
you
observe
that
the
professional
furniture
and
apparatus
are
new
and
that
the
wall
paper
designed
with
the
taste
of
an
undertaker
in
festoons
and
urns
the
carpet
with
its
symmetrical
plans
of
rich
cabbagy
nosegays
the
glass
gasalier
with
lustres
the
ornamental
gilt
rimmed
blue
candlesticks
on
the
ends
of
the
mantelshelf
also
glass
draped
with
lustres
and
the
ormolu
clock
under
a
in
the
middle
between
them
its
uselessness
emphasized
by
a
cheap
american
clock
disrespectfully
placed
beside
it
and
now
indicating
noon
all
combine
with
the
black
marble
which
gives
the
fireplace
the
air
of
a
miniature
family
vault
to
suggest
early
victorian
commercial
respectability
belief
in
money
bible
fetichism
fear
of
hell
always
at
war
with
fear
of
poverty
instinctive
horror
of
the
passionate
character
of
art
love
and
roman
catholic
religion
and
all
the
first
fruits
of
plutocracy
in
the
early
generations
of
the
industrial
revolution
there
is
no
shadow
of
this
on
the
two
persons
who
are
occupying
the
room
just
now
one
of
them
a
very
pretty
woman
in
miniature
her
tiny
figure
dressed
with
the
daintiest
gaiety
is
of
a
later
generation
being
hardly
eighteen
yet
this
darling
little
creature
clearly
does
not
belong
to
the
room
or
even
to
the
country
for
her
complexion
though
very
delicate
has
been
burnt
biscuit
color
by
some
warmer
sun
than
england
and
yet
there
is
for
a
very
subtle
observer
a
link
between
them
for
she
has
a
glass
of
water
in
her
hand
and
a
rapidly
clearing
cloud
of
spartan
obstinacy
on
her
tiny
firm
set
mouth
and
quaintly
squared
eyebrows
if
the
least
line
of
conscience
could
be
traced
between
those
eyebrows
an
evangelical
might
cherish
some
faint
hope
of
finding
her
a
sheep
in
wolf
clothing
for
her
frock
is
recklessly
pretty
but
as
the
cloud
vanishes
it
leaves
her
frontal
sinus
as
smoothly
free
from
conviction
of
sin
as
a
kitten
the
dentist
contemplating
her
with
the
of
a
successful
operator
is
a
young
man
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
he
does
not
give
the
impression
of
being
much
of
a
workman
his
professional
manner
evidently
strikes
him
as
being
a
joke
and
is
underlain
by
a
thoughtless
pleasantry
which
betrays
the
young
gentleman
still
unsettled
and
in
search
of
amusing
adventures
behind
the
newly
dentist
in
search
of
patients
he
is
not
without
gravity
of
demeanor
but
the
strained
nostrils
stamp
it
as
the
gravity
of
the
humorist
his
eyes
are
clear
alert
of
sceptically
moderate
size
and
yet
a
little
rash
his
forehead
is
an
excellent
one
with
plenty
of
room
behind
it
his
nose
and
chin
cavalierly
handsome
on
the
whole
an
attractive
noticeable
beginner
of
whose
prospects
a
man
of
business
might
form
a
tolerably
favorable
estimate
the
young
lady
handing
him
the
glass
thank
you
in
spite
of
the
biscuit
complexion
she
has
not
the
slightest
foreign
accent
the
dentist
putting
it
down
on
the
ledge
of
his
cabinet
of
instruments
that
was
my
first
tooth
the
young
lady
aghast
your
first
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
began
practising
on
me
the
dentist
every
dentist
has
to
begin
on
somebody
the
young
lady
yes
somebody
in
a
hospital
not
people
who
pay
the
dentist
laughing
oh
the
hospital
does
count
i
only
meant
my
first
tooth
in
private
practice
why
did
you
let
me
give
you
gas
the
young
lady
because
you
said
it
would
be
five
shillings
extra
the
dentist
shocked
oh
do
say
that
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
hurt
you
for
the
sake
of
five
shillings
the
young
lady
with
cool
insolence
well
so
you
have
she
gets
up
why
should
you
it
your
business
to
hurt
people
it
amuses
him
to
be
treated
in
this
fashion
he
chuckles
secretly
as
he
proceeds
to
clean
and
replace
his
instruments
she
shakes
her
dress
into
order
looks
inquisitively
about
her
and
goes
to
the
window
you
have
a
good
view
of
the
sea
from
these
rooms
are
they
expensive
the
dentist
yes
the
young
lady
you
do
own
the
whole
house
do
you
the
dentist
no
the
young
lady
taking
the
chair
which
stands
at
the
and
looking
critically
at
it
as
she
spins
it
round
on
one
leg
your
furniture
is
quite
the
latest
thing
is
it
the
dentist
it
my
landlord
the
young
lady
does
he
own
that
nice
comfortable
bath
chair
pointing
to
the
operating
chair
the
dentist
no
i
have
that
on
the
system
the
young
lady
disparagingly
i
thought
so
looking
about
her
again
in
search
of
further
conclusions
i
suppose
you
have
been
here
long
the
dentist
six
weeks
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
to
know
the
young
lady
the
hint
quite
lost
on
her
any
family
the
dentist
i
am
not
married
the
young
lady
of
course
not
anybody
can
see
that
i
meant
sisters
and
mother
and
that
sort
of
thing
the
dentist
not
on
the
premises
the
young
lady
hm
if
you
been
here
six
weeks
and
mine
was
your
first
tooth
the
practice
ca
be
very
large
can
it
the
dentist
not
as
yet
he
shuts
the
cabinet
having
tidied
up
everything
the
young
lady
well
good
luck
she
takes
our
her
purse
five
shillings
you
said
it
would
be
the
dentist
five
shillings
the
young
lady
producing
a
crown
piece
do
you
charge
five
shillings
for
everything
the
dentist
yes
the
young
lady
why
the
dentist
it
my
system
i
what
called
a
five
shilling
dentist
the
young
lady
how
nice
well
here
holding
up
the
crown
piece
a
nice
new
five
shilling
piece
your
first
fee
make
a
hole
in
it
with
the
thing
you
drill
people
teeth
with
and
wear
it
on
your
the
dentist
thank
you
the
parlor
maid
appearing
at
the
door
the
young
lady
brother
sir
a
handsome
man
in
miniature
obviously
the
young
lady
twin
comes
in
eagerly
he
wears
a
suit
of
cashmere
the
elegantly
cut
frock
coat
lined
in
brown
silk
and
carries
in
his
hand
a
brown
tall
hat
and
tan
gloves
to
match
he
has
his
sister
delicate
biscuit
complexion
and
is
built
on
the
same
small
scale
but
he
is
elastic
and
strong
in
muscle
decisive
in
movement
unexpectedly
deeptoned
and
trenchant
in
speech
and
with
perfect
manners
and
a
finished
personal
style
which
might
be
envied
by
a
man
twice
his
age
suavity
and
are
points
of
honor
with
him
and
though
this
rightly
considered
is
only
the
modern
mode
of
boyish
its
effect
is
none
the
less
staggering
to
his
elders
and
would
be
insufferable
in
a
less
prepossessing
youth
he
is
promptitude
itself
and
has
a
question
ready
the
moment
he
enters
the
young
gentleman
am
i
on
time
the
young
lady
no
it
all
over

young
gentleman

bewildered
by
the
leaps
and
bounds
with
which
their
acquaintanceship
is
proceeding
gasps
but
he
has
no
opportunity
of
speaking
as
the
conversation
of

swift
and
continuous
the
young
lady

like
cutting
a
sheet
of
silk
in
two
with
a
flash
of
lightning
it
is
the
result
of
long
practice
in
checking
dolly
indiscretions
the
fact

the
children

celebrated
lanfrey

anticipating

our
appearance
dolly
our
manners
valentine
ad
misericordiam
oh
do
let
me
speak
dolly
the
old
story
we
talk
too
much
philip
we

shut

he
seats
himself
on
the
arm
of
the
opposing
chair
dolly
mum
she
sits
down
in
the
chair
and
closes
her
lips
tight
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
valentine
thank
you
he
brings
the
stool
from
the
bench
in
the
corner
places
it
between
them
and
sits
down
with
a
judicial
air
they
attend
to
him
with
extreme
gravity
he
addresses
himself
first
to
dolly
now
may
i
ask
to
begin
with
have
you
ever
been
in
an
english
seaside
resort
before
she
shakes
her
head
slowly
and
solemnly
he
turns
to
phil
who
shakes
his
head
quickly
and
expressively
i
thought
so
well
clandon
our
acquaintance
has
been
short
but
it
has
been
voluble
and
i
have
gathered
enough
to
convince
me
that
you
are
neither
of
you
capable
of
conceiving
what
life
in
an
english
seaside
resort
is
believe
me
it
not
a
question
of
manners
and
appearance
in
those
respects
we
enjoy
a
freedom
unknown
in
madeira
dolly
shakes
her
head
vehemently
oh
yes
i
assure
you
lord
de
cresci
sister
bicycles
in
knickerbockers
and
the
rector
wife
advocates
dress
reform
and
wears
hygienic
boots
dolly
furtively
looks
at
her
own
shoe
valentine
catches
her
in
the
act
and
deftly
adds
no
that
not
the
sort
of
boot
i
mean
dolly
shoe
vanishes
we
do
bother
much
about
dress
and
manners
in
england
because
as
a
nation
we
do
dress
well
and
no
manners
but
and
now
will
you
excuse
my
frankness
they
nod
thank
you
well
in
a
seaside
resort
there
one
thing
you
must
have
before
anybody
can
afford
to
be
seen
going
about
with
you
and
that
a
father
alive
or
dead
he
looks
at
them
alternately
with
emphasis
they
meet
his
gaze
like
martyrs
am
i
to
infer
that
you
have
omitted
that
indispensable
part
of
your
social
equipment
they
confirm
him
by
melancholy
nods
them
i
sorry
to
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
stay
here
for
any
length
of
time
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
accept
your
kind
invitation
to
lunch
he
rises
with
an
air
of
finality
and
replaces
the
stool
by
the
bench
philip
rising
with
grave
politeness
come
dolly
he
gives
her
his
arm
dolly
good
morning
they
go
together
to
the
door
with
perfect
dignity
valentine
overwhelmed
with
remorse
oh
stop
stop
they
halt
and
turn
arm
in
arm
you
make
me
feel
a
perfect
beast
dolly
that
your
conscience
not
us
valentine
energetically
throwing
off
all
pretence
of
a
professional
manner
my
conscience
my
conscience
has
been
my
ruin
listen
to
me
twice
before
i
have
set
up
as
a
respectable
medical
practitioner
in
various
parts
of
england
on
both
occasions
i
acted
conscientiously
and
told
my
patients
the
brute
truth
instead
of
what
they
wanted
to
be
told
result
ruin
now
i
set
up
as
a
dentist
a
five
shilling
dentist
and
i
done
with
conscience
forever
this
is
my
last
chance
i
spent
my
last
sovereign
on
moving
in
and
i
have
paid
a
shilling
of
rent
yet
i
eating
and
drinking
on
credit
my
landlord
is
as
rich
as
a
jew
and
as
hard
as
nails
and
i
made
five
shillings
in
six
weeks
if
i
swerve
by
a
hair
breadth
from
the
straight
line
of
the
most
rigid
respectability
i
done
for
under
such
a
circumstance
is
it
fair
to
ask
me
to
lunch
with
you
when
you
do
know
your
own
father
dolly
after
all
our
grandfather
is
a
canon
of
lincoln
cathedral
valentine
like
a
castaway
mariner
who
sees
a
sail
on
the
horizon
what
have
you
a
grandfather
dolly
only
one
valentine
my
dear
good
young
friends
why
on
earth
did
you
tell
me
that
before
a
cannon
of
lincoln
that
makes
it
all
right
of
course
just
excuse
me
while
i
change
my
coat
he
reaches
the
door
in
a
bound
and
vanishes
dolly
and
phil
stare
after
him
and
then
stare
at
one
another
missing
their
audience
they
droop
and
become
commonplace
at
once
philip
throwing
away
dolly
arm
and
coming
towards
the
operating
chair
that
wretched
bankrupt
ivory
snatcher
makes
a
compliment
of
allowing
us
to
stand
him
a
lunch
probably
the
first
square
meal
he
has
had
for
months
he
gives
the
chair
a
kick
as
if
it
were
valentine
dolly
it
too
beastly
i
wo
stand
it
any
longer
phil
here
in
england
everybody
asks
whether
you
have
a
father
the
very
first
thing
philip
i
wo
stand
it
either
mamma
must
tell
us
who
he
was
dolly
or
who
he
is
he
may
be
alive
philip
i
hope
not
no
man
alive
shall
father
me
dolly
he
might
have
a
lot
of
money
though
philip
i
doubt
it
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
leads
me
to
believe
that
if
he
had
a
lot
of
money
he
would
have
got
rid
of
his
affectionate
family
so
easily
anyhow
let
look
at
the
bright
side
of
things
depend
on
it
he
dead
he
goes
to
the
hearth
and
stands
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
spreading
himself
the
parlor
maid
appears
the
twins
under
observation
instantly
shine
out
again
with
their
former
brilliancy
the
parlor
maid
two
ladies
for
you
miss
your
mother
and
sister
miss
i
think
clandon
and
gloria
come
in
clandon
is
between
forty
and
fifty
with
a
slight
tendency
to
soft
sedentary
fat
and
a
fair
remainder
of
good
looks
none
the
worse
preserved
because
she
has
evidently
followed
the
old
tribal
matronly
fashion
of
making
no
pretension
in
that
direction
after
her
marriage
and
might
almost
be
suspected
of
wearing
a
cap
at
home
she
carries
herself
artificially
well
as
women
were
taught
to
do
as
a
part
of
good
manners
by
dancing
masters
and
reclining
boards
before
these
were
superseded
by
the
modern
artistic
cult
of
beauty
and
health
her
hair
a
flaxen
hazel
fading
into
white
is
crimped
and
parted
in
the
middle
with
the
ends
plaited
and
made
into
a
knot
from
which
observant
people
of
a
certain
age
infer
that
clandon
had
sufficient
individuality
and
good
taste
to
stand
out
resolutely
against
the
now
forgotten
chignon
in
her
girlhood
in
short
she
is
distinctly
old
fashioned
for
her
age
in
dress
and
manners
but
she
belongs
to
the
forefront
of
her
own
period
say
in
a
jealously
assertive
attitude
of
character
and
intellect
and
in
being
a
woman
of
cultivated
interests
rather
than
passionately
developed
personal
affections
her
voice
and
ways
are
entirely
kindly
and
humane
and
she
lends
herself
conscientiously
to
the
occasional
demonstrations
of
fondness
by
which
her
children
mark
their
esteem
for
her
but
displays
of
personal
sentiment
secretly
embarrass
her
passion
in
her
is
humanitarian
rather
than
human
she
feels
strongly
about
social
questions
and
principles
not
about
persons
only
one
observes
that
this
reasonableness
and
intense
personal
privacy
which
leaves
her
relations
with
gloria
and
phil
much
as
they
might
be
between
her
and
the
children
of
any
other
woman
breaks
down
in
the
case
of
dolly
though
almost
every
word
she
addresses
to
her
is
necessarily
in
the
nature
of
a
remonstrance
for
some
breach
of
decorum
the
tenderness
in
her
voice
is
unmistakable
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
years
of
such
remonstrance
have
left
dolly
hopelessly
spoiled
gloria
who
is
hardly
past
twenty
is
a
much
more
formidable
person
than
her
mother
she
is
the
incarnation
of
haughty
highmindedness
raging
with
the
impatience
of
an
impetuous
dominative
character
paralyzed
by
the
impotence
of
her
youth
and
unwillingly
disciplined
by
the
constant
danger
of
ridicule
from
her
juniors
unlike
her
mother
she
is
all
passion
and
the
conflict
of
her
passion
with
her
obstinate
pride
and
intense
fastidiousness
results
in
a
freezing
coldness
of
manner
in
an
ugly
woman
all
this
would
be
repulsive
but
gloria
is
an
attractive
woman
her
deep
chestnut
hair
olive
brown
skin
long
eyelashes
shaded
grey
eyes
that
often
flash
like
stars
delicately
turned
full
lips
and
compact
and
supple
but
muscularly
plump
figure
appeal
with
disdainful
frankness
to
the
senses
and
imagination
a
very
dangerous
girl
one
would
say
if
the
moral
passions
were
not
also
marked
and
even
nobly
marked
in
a
fine
brow
her
dress
of
saffron
brown
cloth
seems
conventional
when
her
back
is
turned
but
it
displays
in
front
a
blouse
of
silk
which
upsets
its
conventionality
with
one
stroke
and
sets
her
apart
as
effectually
as
the
twins
from
the
ordinary
run
of
fashionable
seaside
humanity
clandon
comes
a
little
way
into
the
room
looking
round
to
see
who
is
present
gloria
who
studiously
avoids
encouraging
the
twins
by
betraying
any
interest
in
them
wanders
to
the
window
and
looks
out
with
her
thoughts
far
away
the
parlor
maid
instead
of
withdrawing
shuts
the
door
and
waits
at
it
clandon
well
children
how
is
the
toothache
dolly
dolly
cured
thank
heaven
i
had
it
out
she
sits
down
on
the
step
of
the
operating
chair
clandon
takes
the
chair
philip
striking
in
gravely
from
the
hearth
and
the
dentist
a
professional
man
of
the
highest
standing
is
coming
to
lunch
with
us
clandon
looking
round
apprehensively
at
the
servant
phil
the
parlor
maid
beg
pardon
i
waiting
for
valentine
i
have
a
message
for
him
dolly
who
from
clandon
shocked
dolly
dolly
catches
her
lips
with
her
finger
tips
suppressing
a
little
splutter
of
mirth
the
parlor
maid
only
the
landlord
valentine
in
a
blue
serge
suit
with
a
straw
hat
in
his
hand
comes
back
in
high
spirits
out
of
breath
with
the
haste
he
has
made
gloria
turns
from
the
window
and
studies
him
with
freezing
attention
philip
let
me
introduce
you
valentine
my
mother
lanfrey
clandon
clandon
bows
valentine
bows
and
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
my
sister
gloria
gloria
bows
with
cold
dignity
and
sits
down
on
the
sofa
valentine
falls
in
love
at
first
sight
and
is
miserably
confused
he
fingers
his
hat
nervously
and
makes
her
a
sneaking
bow
clandon
i
understand
that
we
are
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
luncheon
valentine
valentine
thank
you
er
if
you
do
mind
i
mean
if
you
will
be
so
kind
to
the
parlor
maid
testily
what
is
it
the
parlor
maid
the
landlord
sir
wishes
to
speak
to
you
before
you
go
out
valentine
oh
tell
him
i
have
four
patients
here
the
clandons
look
surprised
except
phil
who
is
imperturbable
if
he
would
mind
waiting
just
two
minutes
i
i
slip
down
and
see
him
for
a
moment
throwing
himself
confidentially
on
her
sense
of
the
position
say
busy
but
that
i
want
to
see
him
the
parlor
maid
reassuringly
yes
sir
she
goes
clandon
on
the
point
of
rising
we
are
detaining
you
i
am
afraid
valentine
not
at
all
not
at
all
your
presence
here
will
be
the
greatest
help
to
me
the
fact
is
i
owe
six
week
rent
and
i
had
no
patients
until
my
interview
with
my
landlord
will
be
considerably
smoothed
by
the
apparent
boom
in
my
business
dolly
vexed
oh
how
tiresome
of
you
to
let
it
all
out
and
just
been
pretending
that
you
were
a
respectable
professional
man
in
a
position
clandon
horrified
oh
dolly
dolly
my
dearest
how
can
you
be
so
rude
to
valentine
will
you
excuse
these
barbarian
children
of
mine
valentine
valentine
thank
you
i
used
to
them
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
you
to
wait
five
minutes
while
i
get
rid
of
my
landlord
downstairs
dolly
do
be
long
we
hungry
clandon
again
remonstrating
dolly
dear
valentine
to
dolly
all
right
to
mrs
clandon
thank
you
i
be
long
he
steals
a
look
at
gloria
as
he
turns
to
go
she
is
looking
gravely
at
him
he
falls
into
confusion
i
er
er
yes
thank
you
he
succeeds
at
last
in
blundering
himself
out
of
the
room
but
the
exhibition
is
a
pitiful
one
philip
did
you
observe
pointing
to
gloria
love
at
first
sight
you
can
add
his
scalp
to
your
collection
gloria
clandon
sh
sh
pray
phil
he
may
have
heard
you
philip
not
he
bracing
himself
for
a
scene
and
now
look
here
mamma
he
takes
the
stool
from
the
bench
and
seats
himself
majestically
in
the
middle
of
the
room
taking
a
leaf
out
of
valentine
book
dolly
feeling
that
her
position
on
the
step
of
the
operating
chair
is
unworthy
of
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
rises
looking
important
and
determined
crosses
to
the
window
and
stands
with
her
back
to
the
end
of
the
her
hands
behind
her
and
on
the
table
clandon
looks
at
them
wondering
what
is
coming
gloria
becomes
attentive
philip
straightens
his
back
places
his
knuckles
symmetrically
on
his
knees
and
opens
his
case
dolly
and
i
have
been
talking
over
things
a
good
deal
lately
and
i
do
think
judging
from
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
we
do
think
that
you
speaking
very
staccato
with
the
words
detached
quite
appreciate
the
fact
dolly
seating
herself
on
the
end
of
the
table
with
a
spring
that
we
grown
up
clandon
indeed
in
what
way
have
i
given
you
any
reason
to
complain
philip
well
there
are
certain
matters
upon
which
we
are
beginning
to
feel
that
you
might
take
us
a
little
more
into
your
confidence
clandon
rising
with
all
the
placidity
of
her
age
suddenly
broken
up
and
a
curious
hard
excitement
dignified
but
dogged
ladylike
but
implacable
the
manner
of
the
old
guard
of
the
women
rights
movement
coming
upon
her
phil
take
care
remember
what
i
have
always
taught
you
there
are
two
sorts
of
family
life
phil
and
your
experience
of
human
nature
only
extends
so
far
to
one
of
them
rhetorically
the
sort
you
know
is
based
on
mutual
respect
on
recognition
of
the
right
of
every
member
of
the
household
to
independence
and
privacy
her
emphasis
on
privacy
is
intense
in
their
personal
concerns
and
because
you
have
always
enjoyed
that
it
seems
such
a
matter
of
course
to
you
that
you
do
value
it
but
with
biting
acrimony
there
is
another
sort
of
family
life
a
life
in
which
husbands
open
their
wives
letters
and
call
on
them
to
account
for
every
farthing
of
their
expenditure
and
every
moment
of
their
time
in
which
women
do
the
same
to
their
children
in
which
no
room
is
private
and
no
hour
sacred
in
which
duty
obedience
affection
home
morality
and
religion
are
detestable
tyrannies
and
life
is
a
vulgar
round
of
punishments
and
lies
coercion
and
rebellion
jealousy
suspicion
recrimination
oh
i
can
not
describe
it
to
you
fortunately
for
you
you
know
nothing
about
it
she
sits
down
panting
gloria
has
listened
to
her
with
flashing
eyes
sharing
all
her
indignation
dolly
inaccessible
to
rhetoric
see
twentieth
century
parents
chapter
on
liberty
passim
clandon
touching
her
shoulder
affectionately
soothed
even
by
a
gibe
from
her
my
dear
dolly
if
you
only
knew
how
glad
i
am
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
joke
to
you
though
it
is
such
bitter
earnest
to
me
more
resolutely
turning
to
philip
phil
i
never
ask
you
questions
about
your
private
concerns
you
are
not
going
to
question
me
are
you
philip
i
think
it
due
to
ourselves
to
say
that
the
question
we
wanted
to
ask
is
as
much
our
business
as
yours
dolly
besides
it
ca
be
good
to
keep
a
lot
of
questions
bottled
up
inside
you
you
did
it
mamma
but
see
how
awfully
it
broken
out
again
in
me
clandon
i
see
you
want
to
ask
your
question
ask
it
dolly
and
philip
beginning
simultaneously
who
they
stop
philip
now
look
here
dolly
am
i
going
to
conduct
this
business
or
are
you
dolly
you
philip
then
hold
your
mouth
dolly
does
so
literally
the
question
is
a
simple
one
when
the
ivory
snatcher
clandon
remonstrating
phil
philip
dentist
is
an
ugly
word
the
man
of
ivory
and
gold
asked
us
whether
we
were
the
children
of
densmore
clandon
of
newbury
hall
in
pursuance
of
the
precepts
in
your
treatise
on
twentieth
century
conduct
and
your
repeated
personal
exhortations
to
us
to
curtail
the
number
of
unnecessary
lies
we
tell
we
replied
truthfully
the
we
did
know
dolly
neither
did
we
philip
sh
the
result
was
that
the
gum
architect
made
considerable
difficulties
about
accepting
our
invitation
to
lunch
although
i
doubt
if
he
has
had
anything
but
tea
and
bread
and
butter
for
a
fortnight
past
now
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
leads
me
to
believe
that
we
had
a
father
and
that
you
probably
know
who
he
was
clandon
her
agitation
returning
stop
phil
your
father
is
nothing
to
you
nor
to
me
vehemently
that
is
enough
the
twins
are
silenced
but
not
satisfied
their
faces
fall
but
gloria
who
has
been
following
the
altercation
attentively
suddenly
intervenes
gloria
advancing
mother
we
have
a
right
to
know
clandon
rising
and
facing
her
gloria
we
who
is
we
gloria
steadfastly
we
three
her
tone
is
unmistakable
she
is
pitting
her
strength
against
her
mother
for
the
first
time
the
twins
instantly
go
over
to
the
enemy
clandon
wounded
in
your
mouth
we
used
to
mean
you
and
i
gloria
philip
rising
decisively
and
putting
away
the
stool
we
hurting
you
let
drop
it
we
did
think
you
mind
i
do
want
to
know
dolly
coming
off
the
table
i
sure
i
do
oh
do
look
like
that
mamma
she
looks
angrily
at
gloria
clandon
touching
her
eyes
hastily
with
her
handkerchief
and
sitting
down
again
thank
you
my
dear
thanks
phil
gloria
inexorably
we
have
a
right
to
know
mother
clandon
indignantly
ah
you
insist
gloria
do
you
intend
that
we
shall
never
know
dolly
oh
gloria
do
it
barbarous
gloria
with
quiet
scorn
what
is
the
use
of
being
weak
you
see
what
has
happened
with
this
gentleman
here
mother
the
same
thing
has
happened
to
me
clandon
all
what
do
you
mean
dolly
together
oh
tell
us
philip
what
happened
to
you
gloria
oh
nothing
of
any
consequence
she
turns
away
from
them
and
goes
up
to
the
easy
chair
at
the
fireplace
where
she
sits
down
almost
with
her
back
to
them
as
they
wait
expectantly
she
adds
over
her
shoulder
with
studied
indifference
on
board
the
steamer
the
first
officer
did
me
the
honor
to
propose
to
me
dolly
no
it
was
to
me
clandon
the
first
officer
are
you
serious
gloria
what
did
you
say
to
him
correcting
herself
excuse
me
i
have
no
right
to
ask
that
gloria
the
answer
is
pretty
obvious
a
woman
who
does
not
know
who
her
father
was
can
not
accept
such
an
offer
clandon
surely
you
did
not
want
to
accept
it
gloria
turning
a
little
and
raising
her
voice
no
but
suppose
i
had
wanted
to
philip
did
that
difficulty
strike
you
dolly
dolly
no
i
accepted
him

out
dolly
philip
together
oh
i
say
dolly
naively
he
did
look
such
a
fool
clandon
but
why
did
you
do
such
a
thing
dolly
dolly
for
fun
i
suppose
he
had
to
measure
my
finger
for
a
ring
have
done
the
same
thing
yourself
clandon
no
dolly
i
would
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
first
officer
did
propose
to
me
and
i
told
him
to
keep
that
sort
of
thing
for
women
were
young
enough
to
be
amused
by
it
he
appears
to
have
acted
on
my
advice
she
rises
and
goes
to
the
hearth
gloria
i
am
sorry
you
think
me
weak
but
i
can
not
tell
you
what
you
want
you
are
all
too
young
philip
this
is
rather
a
startling
departure
from
twentieth
century
principles
dolly
quoting
answer
all
your
children
questions
and
answer
them
truthfully

soon
as
they
are

clandon
my
dears
i
did
not
say
that
you
were
too
young
to
know
i
said
you
were
too
young
to
be
taken
into
my
confidence
you
are
very
bright
children
all
of
you
but
i
am
glad
for
your
sakes
that
you
are
still
very
inexperienced
and
consequently
very
unsympathetic
there
are
some
experiences
of
mine
that
i
can
not
bear
to
speak
of
except
to
those
who
have
gone
through
what
i
have
gone
through
i
hope
you
will
never
be
qualified
for
such
confidences
but
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
learn
all
you
want
to
know
will
that
satisfy
you

another
grievance

up
at

i
did

course
not

do
you

i
understand

rising
but
mother
clandon
drawing
back
a
little
yes
gloria
obstinately
it
is
nonsense
to
tell
us
that
our
father
is
nothing
to
us
clandon
provoked
to
sudden
resolution
do
you
remember
your
father
gloria
meditatively
as
if
the
recollection
were
a
tender
one
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
think
so
clandon
grimly
you
are
not

you
purposely
deliberately
with
the
intention
of
hurting
you
with
a
whip
bought
for
the
purpose
would
you
remember
that
do
you
think
gloria
utters
an
exclamation
of
indignant
repulsion
that
would
have
been
your
last
recollection
of
your
father
gloria
if
i
had
not
taken
you
away
from
him
i
have
kept
him
out
of

now
out
of

by
never

him
to

again
gloria
with
a
shudder
covers
her
face
with
her
hands
until
hearing
someone
at
the
door
she
turns
away
and
pretends
to
occupy
herself
looking
at

troubled

phil
can
you
believe
such
a
horrible
thing
as
that
about
our
father
what
mother
said
just
now
philip
oh
there
are
lots
of
people
of
that
kind
old
chalice
used
to
thrash
his
wife
and
daughters
with
a
cartwhip
dolly
contemptuously
yes
a
portuguese
philip
when
you
come
to

there
is

and

nature
he
resumes
his
position
on
the
hearthrug
with
an
elderly
and
responsible
air
gloria
with
angered
remorse
i
do
think
we
shall
ever
play
again
at
our
old
game
of
guessing
what
our
father
was
to
be
like
dolly
are
you
sorry
for
your
father
the
father
with
lots
of
money
dolly
oh
come
what
about
your
father
the
lonely
old
man
with
the
tender
aching
heart
he
pretty
well
burst
up
i
think
philip
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
governor
is
an
exploded
superstition
valentine
is
heard
talking
to
somebody
outside
the
door
but
hark
he
comes
gloria
nervously
who
dolly
chalkstones
philip
sh
attention
they
put
on
their
best
manners
philip
adds
in
a
lower
voice
to
gloria
if
he
good
enough
for
the
lunch
i
nod
to
dolly
and
if
she
nods
to
you
invite
him
straight
away
valentine
comes
back
with
his
landlord
fergus
crampton
is
a
man
of
about
sixty
tall
hard
and
stringy
with
an
atrociously
obstinate
ill
tempered
grasping
mouth
and
a
querulously
dogmatic
voice
withal
he
is
highly
nervous
and
sensitive
judging
by
his
thin
transparent
skin
marked
with
multitudinous
lines
and
his
slender
fingers
his
consequent
capacity
for
suffering
acutely
from
all
the
dislike
that
his
temper
and
obstinacy
can
bring
upon
him
is
proved
by
his
wistful
wounded
eyes
by
a
plaintive
note
in
his
voice
a
painful
want
of
confidence
in
his
welcome
and
a
constant
but
indifferently
successful
effort
to
correct
his
natural
incivility
of
manner
and
proneness
to
take
offence
by
his
keen
brows
and
forehead
he
is
clearly
a
shrewd
man
and
there
is
no
sign
of
straitened
means
or
commercial
diffidence
about
him
he
is
well
dressed
and
would
be
classed
at
a
guess
as
a
prosperous
master
manufacturer
in
a
business
inherited
from
an
old
family
in
the
aristocracy
of
trade
his
navy
blue
coat
is
not
of
the
usual
fashionable
pattern
it
is
not
exactly
a
pilot
coat
but
it
is
cut
that
way
double
breasted
and
with
stout
buttons
and
broad
lapels
a
coat
for
a
shipyard
rather
than
a
counting
house
he
has
taken
a
fancy
to
valentine
who
cares
nothing
for
his
crossness
of
grain
and
treats
him
with
a
sort
of
disrespectful
humanity
for
which
he
is
secretly
grateful
valentine
may
i
introduce
this
is
crampton
miss
dorothy

clandon
miss

crampton
stands
nervously
bowing

the
most
comfortable
chair

well
perhaps
as
i
am
considerably
the
oldest
person
present
i
he
finishes
the
sentence
by
sitting
down
a
little
rheumatically
in
the
operating
chair
meanwhile
philip
having
studied
him
critically
during
his
passage
across
the
room
nods
to
dolly
and
dolly
nods
to
gloria
gloria
crampton
we
understand
that
we
are
preventing
valentine
from
lunching
with
you
by
taking
him
away
ourselves
my
mother

be
very
glad
indeed
if
you
would
come

much
er

at
one
another
then
at
valentine
and
philip
valentine
and
philip
unequal
to
the
occasion
look
away
from
them
at
one
another
and
are
instantly
so
disconcerted
by
catching
one
another
eye
that
they
look
back
again
and
catch
the
eyes
of
gloria
and
dolly
thus
catching
one
another
all
round
they
all
look
at
nothing
and
are
quite
at
a
loss
crampton
looks
about
him
waiting
for
them
to
begin
the
silence
becomes
unbearable
dolly
suddenly
to
keep
things
going
how
old
are
you
crampton
gloria
hastily
i
am
afraid

that

she

to
the

he
rings
the
bell
many
thanks
he
follows
gloria
and
philip
to
the
door
and
goes
out
with
them
dolly
who
has
meanwhile
stolen
across
to
crampton
make
him
give
you
gas
it
five
shillings
extra
but

crampton
amused
very
well
looking
more
earnestly
at
her
so

to
know
my
age
do
you
i
dolly
with
conviction

crampton
grimly

looking
at
me
so
hard
for
anything
wrong
she
feels
whether
her
hat
is
right
crampton

somebody
dolly
who
crampton

have
a
curious
look
of
my
mother

incredulously
your
mother

sure
you
do
mean
your
daughter
crampton
suddenly
blackening
with
hate
yes

i
mean
my
daughter

a
twinge
of

not
of

dolly
have

from
the
memory
a
rooted
sorrow
with
gas
five
shillings
extra
crampton
vindictively
no
not
a
sorrow
an
injury
that
was
done
me
once
that
all
i
do
forget
injuries
and
i
do
want
to
forget
them
his
features
settle
into
an
implacable
frown
philip
to
look
for
dolly
he
comes
down
behind
her
unobserved
dolly
looking
critically
at
crampton
expression
i
do
think
we
shall
like
you
when
you
are
brooding
over
your
sorrows
philip
who
has
entered
the
room
unobserved
and
stolen
behind
her
my
sister
means
well
crampton
but
she
is
indiscreet
now
dolly
outside
he
takes
her
towards
the
door
dolly
in
a
perfectly
audible
undertone
he
says
he
only
and
he
thinks
me
the
image
of
his
mother
and
he
hates
his
daughter
and
she
is
interrupted
by
the
return
of
valentine
valentine
miss
clandon
has
gone
on

past

crampton
with
enough
teeth
to
eat
with
they
go
out
valentine
comes
down
to
his
cabinet
and
opens
it
crampton
that
a
spoiled
child
valentine
that
one
of
your
modern
products
when
i
was
her
age
i
had
many
a
good
hiding
fresh
in
my
memory
to
teach
me
manners
valentine
taking
up
his
dental
mirror
and
probe
from
the
shelf
in
front
of
the
cabinet
what
did
you
think
of
her
sister
crampton
you
liked
her
better
eh
valentine
rhapsodically
she
struck
me
as
being
he
checks
himself
and
adds
prosaically
however
that
not
business
he
places
himself
behind
crampton
right
shoulder
and
assumes
his
professional
tone
open
please
crampton
opens
his
mouth
valentine
puts
the
mirror
in
and
examines
his
teeth
hm
you
have
broken
that
one
what
a
pity
to
spoil
such
a
splendid
set
of
teeth
why
do
you
crack
nuts
with
them
he
withdraws
the
mirror
and
comes
forward
to
converse
with
crampton
crampton
i
always
cracked
nuts
with
them
what
else
are
they
for
dogmatically
the
proper
way
to
keep
teeth
good
is
to
give
them
plenty
of
use
on
bones
and
nuts
and
wash
them
every
day
with
soap
plain
yellow
soap
valentine
soap
why
soap
crampton
i
began
using
it
as
a
boy
because
i
was
made
to
and
i
used
it
ever
since
and
i
never
had
toothache
in
my
life
valentine
do
you
find
it
rather
nasty
crampton
i
found
that
most
things
that
were
good
for
me
were
nasty
but
i
was
taught
to
put
up
with
them
and
made
to
put
up
with
them
i
used
to
it
now
in
fact
i
like
the
taste
when
the
soap
is
really
good
valentine
making
a
wry
face
in
spite
of
himself
you
seem
to
have
been
very
carefully
educated
crampton
crampton
grimly
i
was
spoiled

all
events
valentine

a
little
to

to

ledge
of
cabinet
and

of
the
chair

converse

as
much
as

beneficial
effect
on
your
character
crampton
rising
and
glaring
at
him
young
man
you
owe
me
six
rent
valentine
i
do
crampton
can
you
pay
me
valentine
no
crampton
satisfied
with
his
advantage
i
thought
not
how
soon
think
you
be
able
to
pay
me
if
you
have
no
better
manners
than
to
make
game
of
your
patients
he
sits
down
again
valentine
my
good
sir
my
patients
have
all
formed
their
characters
on
kitchen
soap
crampton
suddenly
gripping
him
by
the
arm
as
he
turns
away
again
to
the
cabinet
so
much
the
worse
for
them
i
tell
you
you
do
understand
my
character
if
i
could
spare
all
my
teeth
i
make
you
pull
them
all
out
one
after
another
to
shew
you
what
a
properly
hardened
man
can
go
through
with
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
it
he
nods
at
him
to
enforce
the
effect
of
this
declaration
and
releases
him
valentine
his
careless
pleasantry
quite
unruffled
and
you
want
to
be
more
hardened
do
you
crampton
yes
valentine
strolling
away
to
the
bell
well
you
quite
hard
enough
for
me
already
as
a
landlord
crampton
receives
this
with
a
growl
of
grim
humor
valentine
rings
the
bell
and
remarks
in
a
cheerful
casual
way
whilst
waiting

of

carries
on

conversation

a
forceps

to
his
hand

a
gag
and
a
drinking
glass

devil
that

to
me

have
an
idea
of
getting

crampton
with
grumbling
irony

when

young

hours
of

furniture

upon
by
his

jug
of
hot
water
valentine

he
takes
the
jug
from

brings

to

cabinet

in
the
same
idle
strain

should
like
to
know
your
family

maid
goes
out
and
he
pours
some
hot
water

out
of
my
way
valentine
with
a
hitch
of
his
eyebrows
and
shoulders
drops
the
forceps
with
a
clink
into
the
glass
of
hot
water
you
need
warm
that
thing
to
use
on
me
i
not
afraid
of
the
cold
steel

stoops
to
arrange

gas
pump
and
cylinder
beside
the
chair
that
heavy
thing

necessary
purchase
for

good
pull
crampton
looks
alarmed
in
spite
of
himself
valentine
stands
upright
and
places
the
glass
with
the
forceps
in
it
ready
to
his
hand
chatting
on
with
provoking
indifference
and
so
you
advise
me
not
to
get
married
crampton
he
stoops
to
fit
the
handle
on
the
apparatus
by
which
the
chair
is
raised
and
lowered
crampton
irritably
i
advise
you
to
get
my
tooth
out
and
have
done
reminding
me
of
my
wife
come
along
man
he
grips
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
braces
himself
valentine
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
lever
to
look
up
at
him
and
say
what
do
you
bet
that
i
do
get
that
tooth
out
without
your
feeling
it
crampton
your
six
week
rent
young
man
do
you
gammon
me
valentine
jumping
at
the
bet
and
winding
him
aloft
vigorously
done
are
you
ready
crampton
who
has
lost
his
grip
of
the
chair
in
his
alarm
at
its
sudden
ascent
folds
his
arms
sits
stiffly
upright
and
prepares
for
the
worst
valentine
lets
down
the
back
of
the
chair
to
an
obtuse
angle
crampton
clutching
at
the
arms
of
the
chair
as
he
falls
back
take
care
man
i
quite
helpless
in
this
po
valentine
deftly
stopping
him
with
the
gag
and
snatching
up
the
mouthpiece
of
the
gas
machine
you
be
more
helpless
presently
he
presses
the
mouthpiece
over
crampton
mouth
and
nose
leaning
over
his
chest
so
as
to
hold
his
head
and
shoulders
well
down
on
the
chair
crampton
makes
an
inarticulate
sound
in
the
mouthpiece
and
tries
to
lay
hands
on
valentine
whom
he
supposes
to
be
in
front
of
him
after
a
moment
his
arms
wave
aimlessly
then
subside
and
drop
he
is
quite
insensible
valentine
with
an
exclamation
of
somewhat
preoccupied
triumph
throws
aside
the
mouthpiece
quickly
picks
up
the
forceps
adroitly
from
the
glass
and
the
curtain
falls
end
of

i
act
ii
on
the
terrace
at
the
marine
hotel
it
is
a
square
flagged
platform
with
a
parapet
of
heavy
oil
jar
pilasters
supporting
a
broad
stone
coping
on
the
outer
edge
which
stands
up
over
the
sea
like
a
cliff
the
head
waiter
of
the
establishment
busy
laying
napkins
on
a
luncheon
table
with
his
back
to
the
sea
has
the
hotel
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
in
the
corner
nearest
the
sea
the
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
beach
when
he
looks
down
the
terrace
in
front
of
him
he
sees
a
little
to
his
left
a
solitary
guest
a
gentleman
sitting
on
a
chair
of
iron
laths
at
a
little
iron
table
with
a
bowl
of
lump
sugar
and
three
wasps
on
it
reading
the
standard
with
his
umbrella
up
to
defend
him
from
the
sun
which
in
august
and
at
less
than
an
hour
after
noon
is
toasting
his
protended
insteps
just
opposite
him
at
the
hotel
side
of
the
terrace
there
is
a
garden
seat
of
the
ordinary
esplanade
pattern
access
to
the
hotel
for
visitors
is
by
an
entrance
in
the
middle
of
its
facade
reached
by
a
couple
of
steps
on
a
broad
square
of
raised
pavement
nearer
the
parapet
there
lurks
a
way
to
the
kitchen
masked
by
a
little
trellis
porch
the
table
at
which
the
waiter
is
occupied
is
a
long
one
set
across
the
terrace
with
covers
and
chairs
for
five
two
at
each
side
and
one
at
the
end
next
the
hotel
against
the
parapet
another
table
is
prepared
as
a
buffet
to
serve
from
the
waiter
is
a
remarkable
person
in
his
way
a
silky
old
man
and
delicate
looking
but
so
cheerful
and
contented
that
in
his
encouraging
presence
ambition
stands
rebuked
as
vulgarity
and
imagination
as
treason
to
the
abounding
sufficiency
and
interest
of
the
actual
he
has
a
certain
expression
peculiar
to
men
who
have
been
extraordinarily
successful
in
their
calling
and
who
whilst
aware
of
the
vanity
of
success
are
untouched
by
envy
the
gentleman
at
the
iron
table
is
not
dressed
for
the
seaside
he
wears
his
london
frock
coat
and
gloves
and
his
tall
silk
hat
is
on
the
table
beside
the
sugar
bowl
the
excellent
condition
and
quality
of
these
garments
the
folding
spectacles
through
which
he
is
reading
the
standard
and
the
times
at
his
elbow
overlaying
the
local
paper
all
testify
to
his
respectability
he
is
about
fifty
clean
shaven
and
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
down
purposely
as
if
he
suspected
them
of
wanting
to
turn
up
and
was
determined
not
to
let
them
have
their
way
he
has
large
expansive
ears
cod
colored
eyes
and
a
brow
kept
resolutely
wide
open
as
if
again
he
had
resolved
in
his
youth
to
be
truthful
magnanimous
and
incorruptible
but
had
never
succeeded
in
making
that
habit
of
mind
automatic
and
unconscious
still
he
is
by
no
means
to
be
laughed
at
there
is
no
sign
of
stupidity
or
infirmity
of
will
about
him
on
the
contrary
he
would
pass
anywhere
at
sight
as
a
man
of
more
than
average
professional
capacity
and
responsibility
just
at
present
he
is
enjoying
the
weather
and
the
sea
too
much
to
be
out
of
patience
but
he
has
exhausted
all
the
news
in
his
papers
and
is
at
present
reduced
to
the
advertisements
which
are
not
sufficiently
succulent
to
induce
him
to
persevere
with
them
the
gentleman
yawning
and
giving
up
the
paper
as
a
bad
job
waiter
waiter
sir
coming
down
the
gentleman
are
you
quite
sure
clandon
is
coming
back
before
lunch
waiter
quite
sure
sir
she
expects
you
at
a
quarter
to
one
sir
the
gentleman
soothed
at
once
by
the
waiter
voice
looks
at
him
with
a
lazy
smile
it
is
a
quiet
voice
with
a
gentle
melody
in
it
that
gives
sympathetic
interest
to
his
most
commonplace
remark
and
he
speaks
with
the
sweetest
propriety
neither
dropping
his
aitches
nor
misplacing
them
nor
committing
any
other
vulgarism
he
looks
at
his
watch
as
he
continues
not
that
yet
sir
is
it
sir
only
two
minutes
more
to
wait
sir
nice

gentleman

the
young
lady
and
gentleman
the
gentleman
miss
dorothea
and
philip
i
suppose
waiter
yes
sir
the
young
lady
in
giving
an
order
or
the
like
of
that
will
say
remember
william
we
came
to
this
hotel
on
your
account
having
heard
what
a
perfect
waiter
you
are
the
young
gentleman
will
tell
me
that
i
remind
him
strongly
of
his
father
the
gentleman
starts
at
this
and
that
he
expects
me
to
act
by
him
as
such
soothing
sunny
cadence
oh
very
pleasant
sir
very
affable
and
pleasant
indeed
the
gentleman
you
like
his
father
he
laughs
at
the
notion
waiter
oh
we
must
not
take
what
they
say
too
seriously
sir
of
course
sir
if
it
were
true
the
young
lady
would
have
seen
the
resemblance
too
sir
the
gentleman
did
she
waiter
no
sir
she
thought
me
like
the
bust
of
shakespear
in
stratford
church
sir
that
is
why
she
calls
me
william
sir
my
real
name
is
walter
sir
he
turns
to
go
back
to
the
table
and
sees
clandon
coming
up
to
the
terrace
from
the
beach
by
the
steps
here
is
clandon
sir
to
clandon
in
an
unobtrusively
confidential
tone
gentleman
for
you
clandon
we
shall
have
two
more
gentlemen
at
lunch
william
waiter
right
thank
you
he
withdraws
into
the
hotel
clandon
comes
forward
looking
round
for
her
visitor
but
passes
over
the
gentleman
without
any
sign
of
recognition
the
gentleman
peering
at
her
quaintly
from
under
the
umbrella
you
know
me
clandon
incredulously
looking
hard
at
him
are
you
finch
mccomas
mccomas
ca
you
guess
he
shuts
the
umbrella
puts
it
aside
and
jocularly
plants
himself
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
to
be
inspected
clandon
i
believe
you
are
she
gives
him
her
hand
the
shake
that
ensues
is
that
of
old
friends
after
a
long
separation
where
your
beard
mccomas
with
humorous
solemnity
would
you
employ
a
solicitor
with
a
beard
clandon
pointing
to
the
silk
hat
on
the
table
is
that
your
hat
mccomas
would
you
employ
a
solicitor
with
a
sombrero
clandon
i
have
thought
of
you
all
these
eighteen
years
with
the
beard
and
the
sombrero
she
sits
down
on
the
garden
seat
mccomas
takes
his
chair
again
do
you
go
to
the
meetings
of
the
dialectical
society
still
mccomas
gravely
i
do
not
frequent
meetings
now
clandon
finch
i
see
what
has
happened
you
have
become
respectable
mccomas
have
you
clandon
not
a
bit
mccomas
you
hold
to
your
old
opinions
still
clandon
as
firmly
as
ever
mccomas
bless
me
and
you
are
still
ready
to
make
speeches
in
public
in
spite
of
your
sex
clandon
nods
to
insist
on
a
married
woman
right
to
her
own
separate
property
she
nods
again
to
champion
darwin
view
of
the
origin
of
species
and
john
stuart
mill
essay
on
liberty
nod
to
read
huxley
tyndall
and
george
eliot
three
nods
and
to
demand
university
degrees
the
opening
of
the
professions
and
the
parliamentary
franchise
for
women
as
well
as
men
clandon
resolutely
yes
i
have
not
gone
back
one
inch
and
i
have
educated
gloria
to
take
up
my
work
where
i
left
it
that
is
what
has
brought
me
back
to
england
i
felt
that
i
had
no
right
to
bury
her
alive
in
madeira
my
helena
finch
i
suppose
she
will
be
howled
at
as
i
was
but
she
is
prepared
for
that
mccomas
howled
at
my
dear
good
lady
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
those
views
to
prevent
her
from
marrying
a
bishop
you
reproached
me
just
now
for
having
become
respectable
you
were
wrong
i
hold
to
our
old
opinions
as
strongly
as
ever
i
do
go
to
church
and
i
pretend
i
do
i
call
myself
what
i
am
a
philosophic
radical
standing
for
liberty
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
as
i
learnt
to
do
from
my
master
herbert
spencer
am
i
howled
at
no
i
indulged
as
an
old
fogey
i
out
of
everything
because
i
refused
to
bow
the
knee
to
socialism
clandon
shocked
socialism
mccomas
yes
socialism
that
what
miss
gloria
will
be
up
to
her
ears
in
before
the
end
of
the
month
if
you
let
her
loose
here
clandon
emphatically
but
i
can
prove
to
her
that
socialism
is
a
fallacy
mccomas
touchingly
it
is
by
proving
that
clandon
that
i
have
lost
all
my
young
disciples
be
careful
what
you
do
let
her
go
her
own
way
with
some
bitterness
we
the
world
thinks
it
has
left
us
behind
there
is
only
one
place
in
all
england
where
your
opinions
would
still
pass
as
advanced
clandon
scornfully
unconvinced
the
church
perhaps
mccomas
no
the
theatre
and
now
to
business
why
have
you
made
me
come
down
here
clandon
well
partly
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
mccomas
with
irony
thanks
clandon
and
partly
because
i
want
you
to
explain
everything
to
the
children
they
know
nothing
and
now
that
we
have
come
back
to
england
it
is
impossible
to
leave
them
in
ignorance
any
longer
agitated
finch
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
tell
them
i
she
is
interrupted
by
the
twins
and
gloria
dolly
comes
tearing
up
the
steps
racing
philip
who
combines
a
terrific
speed
with
unhurried
propriety
of
bearing
which
however
costs
him
the
race
as
dolly
reaches
her
mother
first
and
almost
upsets
the
garden
seat
by
the
precipitancy
of
her
arrival
dolly
breathless
it
all
right
mamma
the
dentist
is
coming
and
he
bringing
his
old
man
clandon
dolly
dear
do
you
see
mccomas
mccomas
rises
smilingly
dolly
her
face
falling
with
the
most
disparagingly
obvious
disappointment
this
where
are
the
flowing
locks
philip
seconding
her
warmly
where
the
beard
the
cloak
the
poetic
exterior
dolly
oh
mccomas
you
gone
and
spoiled
yourself
why
did
you
wait
till
we
seen
you
mccomas
taken
aback
but
rallying
his
humor
to
meet
the
emergency
because
eighteen
years
is
too
long
for
a
solicitor
to
go
without
having
his
hair
cut
gloria
at
the
other
side
of
mccomas
how
do
you
do
mccomas
he
turns
and
she
takes
his
hand
and
presses
it
with
a
frank
straight
look
into
his
eyes
we
are
glad
to
meet
you
at
last
mccomas
miss
gloria
i
presume
gloria
smiles
assent
and
releases
his
hand
after
a
final
pressure
she
then
retires
behind
the
garden
seat
leaning
over
the
back
beside
mrs
clandon
and
this
young
gentleman
philip
i
was
christened
in
a
comparatively
prosaic
mood
my
name
is
dolly
completing
his
sentence
for
him
declamatorily
norval
on
the
grampian
hills
philip
declaiming
gravely
my
father
feeds
his
flock
a
frugal
swain
clandon
remonstrating
dear
dear
children
do
be
silly
everything
is
so
new
to
them
here
finch
that
they
are
in
the
wildest
spirits
they
think
every
englishman
they
meet
is
a
joke
dolly
well
so
he
is
it
not
our
fault
philip
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
fairly
extensive
mccomas
but
i
find
it
impossible
to
take
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
seriously
mccomas
i
presume
sir
you
are
master
philip
offering
his
hand
philip
taking
mccomas
hand
and
looking
solemnly
at
him
i
was
master
philip
was
so
for
many
years
just
as
you
were
once
master
finch
he
gives
his
hand
a
single
shake
and
drops
it
then
turns
away
exclaiming
meditatively
how
strange
it
is
to

profound
mock
gravity

it
between
the
little
table
and
the
garden
seat
with
dolly
on
his
right
and
philip
on
his
left
and
settles
himself
in
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
about
to
begin
a
long
communication
the
clandons
match
him
expectantly
mccomas
ahem
your

dolly
mccomas
stopping
her
let

answer
that
clandon
the
answer
will
surprise
you
considerably
he
lives
in
this
town
clandon
rises
she
and

at
one
another
in
the
greatest
consternation
dolly
with
conviction
i
knew
it
phil
chalkstones
is
our
father
mccomas
chalkstones
dolly
oh
crampstones
or
whatever
it
is
he
said
i
was
like
his
mother
i
knew
he
must
mean
his
daughter
philip
very
seriously
mccomas
i
desire
to
consider
your
feelings
in
every
possible
way
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
stretch
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
to
the
length
of
telling
me
that
crampton
of
this
town
is
my
father
i
shall
decline
to
entertain
the
information
for
a
moment
mccomas
and
pray
why
philip
because
i
have
seen
the
gentleman
and
he
is
entirely
unfit
to
be
my
father
or
dolly
father
or
gloria
father
or
my
husband
mccomas
oh
indeed
well
sir
let
me
tell

you
to
say
to
that
dolly
whimpering
you
need
be
so
cross
crampton

your
father
philip
mccomas
your
conduct
is
heartless
here
you
find
a
family
enjoying
the
unspeakable
peace
and
freedom
of
being
orphans
we
have
never
seen
the
face
of
a
relative
never
known
a
claim
except
the
claim
of
freely
chosen
friendship
and
now
you
wish
to
thrust
into
the
most
intimate
relationship
with
us
a
man
whom
we
do
know
dolly
vehemently
an
awful
old
man
reproachfully
and
you
began
as
if
you
had
quite
a
nice
father
for
us
mccomas
angrily
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
not
nice
and
what
right
have
you
to
choose
your
own
father
raising
his
voice
let
me
tell
you
miss
clandon
that
you
are
too
young
to
dolly
interrupting
him
suddenly
and
eagerly
stop
i
forgot
has
he
any
money
mccomas
he
has
a
great
deal
of
money
dolly
delighted
oh
what
did
i
always
say
phil
philip

have
perhaps
been
condemning
the
old
man
too
hastily

mccomas
mccomas
i
shall
not
proceed
sir
i
am
too
hurt
too
shocked
to
proceed
clandon
urgently

a
few
moments
mccomas
completely

out
slowly
and
carefully
he
coming
coming
to

which
of

steps
and
the
other
so
as

and
marches

valentine
comes
lightly
up
the
steps
from
the
beach
followed
doggedly
by
crampton
valentine
carries
a
walking
stick
crampton
either
because
he
is
old
and
chilly
or
with
some
idea
of
extenuating
the
unfashionableness
of
his
reefer
jacket
wears
a
light
overcoat
he
stops
at
the
chair
left
by
mccomas
in
the
middle
of
the
terrace
and
steadies
himself
for
a
moment
by
placing
his
hand
on
the
back
of
it
crampton
those
steps
make
me
giddy
he
passes
his
hand
over
his
forehead
i
have
not
got
over
that
infernal
gas
yet
he
goes
to
the
iron
chair
so
that
he
can
lean
his
elbows
on
the
little
table
to
prop
his
head
as
he
sits
he
soon
recovers
and
begins
to
unbutton
his
overcoat

smoothly

to
crampton
who

risen
to
get
the
overcoat
off

down
again
and
the

resumes
the
broken
melody
the
young
gentleman

father
sir
crampton
what
waiter
only
his
joke
sir
his
favourite
joke
yesterday
i
was
to
be
his
father
as
soon
as
he
knew
you
were
coming
sir
he
tried
to
put
it
up
on
me
that
you
were
his
father
his
long
lost
father
not
seen
you
for
eighteen
years
he
said
crampton
startled
eighteen
years
waiter
yes
sir
with
gentle
archness
but
i
was
up
to
his
tricks
sir
i
saw
the
idea
coming
into
his
head
as
he
stood
there
thinking
what
new
joke
he
have
with
me
yes
sir
that
the
sort
he
is
very
pleasant
ve
ry
off
hand
and
affable
indeed
sir
again
changing
his
tempo
to
say
to
valentine
who
is
putting
his
stick
down
against
the
corner
of
the
garden
seat
if
you
allow
me
sir
taking
stick
thank
you
sir
valentine
strolls
up
to
the
luncheon
table
and
looks
at
the
menu
the
waiter
turns
to
crampton
and
resumes
his
lay
even
the
solicitor
took
up
the
joke
although
he
was
in
a
manner
of
speaking
in
my
confidence
about
the
young
gentleman
sir
yes
sir
i
assure
you
sir
you
would
never
imagine
what
respectable
professional
gentlemen
from
london
will
do
on
an
outing
when
the
sea
air
takes
them
sir
crampton
oh

a
solicitor
with
them
is
there
waiter
the
family
solicitor
sir
yes
sir
name
of
mccomas
sir
he
goes
towards
hotel
entrance
with
coat
and
stick
happily
unconscious
of
the
bomblike
effect
the
name
has
produced
on
crampton
crampton
rising
in
angry
alarm
mccomas
calls
to
valentine
valentine
again
fiercely
valentine
valentine
turns
this
is
a
plant
a
conspiracy
this
is
my
family
my
children
my
infernal
wife
valentine
coolly
on
indeed
interesting
meeting
he
resumes
his
study
of
the
menu
crampton
meeting

out
of
this
calling
to
the
waiter
give
me
that
coat
waiter
yes
sir
he
comes
back
puts
valentine
stick
carefully
down
against
the
luncheon
table
and
delicately
shakes
the
coat
out
and
holds
it
for
crampton
to
put
on
i
seem
to
have
done
the
young
gentleman
an
injustice
sir
have
i
sir
crampton
rrrh
he
stops
on
the
point
of
putting
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
and
turns
to
valentine
with
sudden
suspicion
valentine
you
are
in
this
you
made
this
plot
you
valentine
decisively
bosh
he
throws
the
menu
down
and
goes
round
the
table
to
look
out
unconcernedly
over
the
parapet
crampton
angrily
what
d
mccomas
followed
by
philip
and
dolly
comes
out
he
vacillates
for
a
moment
on
seeing
crampton
waiter
softly
interrupting
crampton
steady
sir
here
they
come
sir
he
takes
up
the
stick
and
makes
for
the
hotel
throwing
the
coat
across
his
arm
mccomas
turns
the
corners
of
his
mouth
resolutely
down
and
crosses
to
crampton
who
draws
back
and
glares
with
his
hands
behind
him
mccomas
with
his
brow
opener
than
ever
confronts
him
in
the
majesty
of
a
spotless
conscience
waiter
aside
as
he
passes
philip
on
his
way
out
i
broke
it
to
him
sir
philip
invaluable
william
he
passes
on
to
the
table
dolly
aside
to
the
waiter
how
did
he
take
it
waiter
aside
to
her
startled
at
first
miss
but
resigned
very
resigned
indeed
miss
he
takes
the
stick
and
coat
into
the
hotel
mccomas
having
stared
crampton
out
of
countenance
so
here
you
are
crampton
crampton
yes
here
caught
in
a
trap
a
mean
trap
are
those
my
children
philip
with
deadly
politeness
is
this
our
father
mccomas
mccomas
yes
er
he
loses
countenance
himself
and
stops
dolly
conventionally
pleased
to
meet
you
again
she
wanders
idly
round
the
table
exchanging
a
smile
and
a
word
of
greeting
with
valentine
on
the
way
philip
allow
me
to
discharge
my
first
duty
as
host
by
ordering
your
wine
he
takes
the
wine
list
from
the
table
his
polite
attention
and
dolly
unconcerned
indifference
leave
crampton
on
the
footing
of
the
casual
acquaintance
picked
up
that
morning
at
the
dentist
the
consciousness
of
it
goes
through
the
father
with
so
keen
a
pang
that
he
trembles
all
over
his
brow
becomes
wet
and
he
stares
dumbly
at
his
son
who
just
conscious
enough
of
his
own
callousness
to
intensely
enjoy
the
humor
and
adroitness
of
it
proceeds
pleasantly
finch
some
crusted
old
port
for
you
as
a
respectable
family
solicitor
eh
mccomas
firmly
apollinaris
only
i
prefer
to
take
nothing
heating
he
walks
away
to
the
side
of
the
terrace
like
a
man
putting
temptation
behind
him
philip
valentine
valentine
would
lager
be
considered
vulgar
philip
probably
we
order
some
dolly
takes
it
turning
to
crampton
with
cheerful
politeness
and
now
crampton
what
can
we
do
for
you
crampton
what
d
mean
boy
philip
boy
very
solemnly
whose
fault
is
it
that
i
am
a
boy
crampton
snatches
the
wine
list
rudely
from
him
and
irresolutely
pretends
to
read
it
philip
abandons
it
to
him
with
perfect
politeness
dolly
looking
over
crampton

the
whisky

slips
her

through

had
respect
from
them
aye
kindness
would
one
of
them
have
spoken
to
me
as
that
girl
spoke
would
one
of
them
have
laughed
at
me
as
that
boy
was
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
frantically
my
own
children
m
i
s
t
e
r
crampton
my
valentine
come
come
they
only
children
the
only
one
of
them
that
worth
anything
called
you
father
crampton
wildly
yes
father
oh
yes
she
got
at
my
feelings
with
a
stab
valentine
taking
this
in
very
bad
part
now
look
here
crampton
you
just
let
her
alone
she
treated
you
very
well
i
had
a
much
worse
time
of
it
at
lunch
than
you
crampton
you
valentine
with
growing
impetuosity
yes
i
sat
next
to
her
and
i
never
said
a
single
thing
to
her
the
whole
time
could
think
of
a
blessed
word
and
not
a
word
did
she
say
to
me
crampton
well
valentine
well
well
tackling
him
very
seriously
and
talking
faster
and
faster
crampton
do
you
know
what
been
the
matter
with
me
you
do
suppose
do
you
that
i
in
the
habit
of
playing
such
tricks
on
my
patients
as
i
played
on
you
crampton
i
hope
not
valentine
the
explanation
is
that
i
stark
mad
or
rather
that
never
been
in
my
real
senses
before
i
capable
of
anything
i
grown
up
at
last
i
a
man
and
it
your
daughter
that
made
a
man
of
me
crampton
incredulously
are
you
in
love
with
my
daughter
valentine
his
words
now
coming
in
a
perfect
torrent
love
nonsense
it
something
far
above
and
beyond
that
it
life
it
faith
strength
certainty
paradise
crampton
interrupting
him
with
acrid
contempt
rubbish
man
what
have
you
to
keep
a
wife
on
you
ca
marry
her
valentine
who
wants
to
marry
her
i
kiss
her
hands
i
kneel
at
her
feet
i
live
for
her
i
die
for
her
and
that
be
enough
for
me
look
at
her
book
see
he
kisses
the
handkerchief
if
you
offered
me
all
your
money
for
this
excuse
for
going
down
to
the
beach
and
speaking
to
her
again
i
only
laugh
at
you
he
rushes
buoyantly
off
to
the
steps
where
he
bounces
right
into
the
arms
of
the
waiter
who
is
coming
up
form
the
beach
the
two
save
themselves
from
falling
by
clutching
one
another
tightly
round
the
waist
and
whirling
one
another
around
waiter
delicately
steady
sir
steady
valentine
shocked
at
his
own
violence
i
beg
your
pardon
waiter
not
at
all
sir
not
at
all
very
natural
sir
i
sure
sir
at
your
age
the
lady
has
sent
me
for
her
book
sir
might
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
to
let
her
have
it
at
once
sir
valentine
with
pleasure
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
present
you
with
a
professional
man
earnings
for
six
weeks
offering
him
dolly
crown
piece
waiter
as
if
the
sum
were
beyond
his
utmost
expectations
thank
you
sir
much
obliged
valentine
dashes
down
the
steps
very
young
gentleman
sir
very
manly
and
straight
set
up
crampton
in
grumbling
disparagement
and
making
his
fortune
in
a
hurry
no
doubt
i
know
what
his
six
weeks
earnings
come
to
he
crosses
the
terrace
to
the
iron
table
and
sits
down
waiter
philosophically
well
sir
you
never
can
tell
that
a
principle
in
life
with
me
sir
if
you
excuse
my
having
such
a
thing
sir
delicately
sinking
the
philosopher
in
the
waiter
for
a
moment
perhaps
you
have
noticed
that
you
had
touched
that
seltzer
and
irish
sir
when
the
party
broke
up
he
takes
the
tumbler
from
the
luncheon
table
and
sets
if
before
crampton
yes
sir
you
never
can
tell
there
was
my
son
sir
who
ever
thought
that
he
would
rise
to
wear
a
silk
gown
sir
and
yet
sir
nothing
less
than
fifty
guineas
sir
what
a
lesson
sir
crampton
well
i
hope
he
is
grateful
to
you
and
recognizes
what
he
owes
you
waiter
we
get
on
together
very
well
very
well
indeed
sir
considering
the
difference
in
our
stations
with
another
of
his
irresistible
transitions
a
small
lump
of
sugar
sir
will
take
the
flatness
out
of
the
seltzer
without
noticeably
sweetening
the
drink
sir
allow
me
sir
he
drops
a
lump
of
sugar
into
the
tumbler
but
as
i
say
to
him
where
the
difference
after
all
if
i
must
put
on
a
dress
coat
to
show
what
i
am
sir
he
must
put
on
a
wig
and
gown
to
show
what
he
is
if
my
income
is
mostly
tips
and
there
a
pretence
that
i
do
get
them
why
his
income
is
mostly
fees
sir
and
i
understand
there
a
pretence
that
he
do
get
them
if
he
likes
society
and
his
profession
brings
him
into
contact
with
all
ranks
so
does
mine
too
sir
if
it
a
little
against
a
barrister
to
have
a
waiter
for
his
father
sir
a
little
against
a
waiter
to
have
a
barrister
for
a
son
many
people
consider
it
a
great
liberty
sir
i
assure
you
sir
can
i
get
you
anything
else
sir
crampton
no
thank
you
with
bitter
humility
i
suppose
that
no
objection
to
my
sitting
here
for
a
while
i
ca
disturb
the
party
on
the
beach
here
waiter
with
emotion
very
kind
of
you
sir
to
put
it
as
if
it
was
not
a
compliment
and
an
honour
to
us
crampton
very
kind
indeed
the
more
you
are
at
home
here
sir
the
better
for
us
crampton
in
poignant
irony
home
waiter
reflectively
well
yes
sir
that
a
way
of
looking
at
it
too
sir
i
have
always
said
that
the
great
advantage
of
a
hotel
is
that
it
a
refuge
from
home
life
sir
crampton
i
missed
that
advantage
i
think
waiter
you
did
sir
you
did
dear
me
it
the
unexpected
that
always
happens
is
it
shaking
his
head
you
never
can
tell
sir
you
never
can
tell
he
goes
into
the
hotel
crampton
his
eyes
shining
hardly
as
he
props
his
drawn
miserable
face
on
his
hands
home
home
he
drops
his
arms
on
the
table
and
bows
his
head
on
them
but
presently
hears
someone
approaching
and
hastily
sits
bolt
upright
it
is
gloria
who
has
come
up
the
steps
alone
with
her
sunshade
and
her
book
in
her
hands
he
looks
defiantly
at
her
with
the
brutal
obstinacy
of
his
mouth
and
the
wistfulness
of
his
eyes
contradicting
each
other
pathetically
she
comes
to
the
corner
of
the
garden
seat
and
stands
with
her
back
to
it
leaning
against
the
end
of
it
and
looking
down
at
him
as
if
wondering
at
his
weakness
too
curious
about
him
to
be
cold
but
supremely
indifferent
to
their
kinship
well
gloria
i
want
to
speak
with
you
for
a
moment
crampton
looking
steadily
at
her
indeed
that
surprising
you
meet
your
father
after
eighteen
years
and
you
actually
want
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
that
touching
is
it
he
rests
his
head
on
his
hands
and
looks
down
and
away
from
her
in
gloomy
reflection
gloria
all
that
is
what
seems
to
me
so
nonsensical
so
uncalled
for
what
do
you
expect
us
to
feel
for
you
to
do
for
you
what
is
it
you
want
why
are
you
less
civil
to
us
than
other
people
are
you
are
evidently
not
very
fond
of
us
why
should
you
be
but
surely
we
can
meet
without
quarrelling
crampton
a
dreadful
grey
shade
passing
over
his
face
do
you
realize
that
i
am
your
father
gloria
perfectly
crampton
do
you
know
what
is
due
to
me
as
your
father
gloria
for
instance
crampton
rising
as
if
to
combat
a
monster
for
instance
for
instance
for
instance
duty
affection
respect
obedience
gloria
quitting
her
careless
leaning
attitude
and
confronting
him
promptly
and
proudly
i
obey
nothing
but
my
sense
of
what
is
right
i
respect
nothing
that
is
not
noble
that
is
my
duty
she
adds
less
firmly
as
to
affection
it
is
not
within
my
control
i
am
not
sure
that
i
quite
know
what
affection
means
she
turns
away
with
an
evident
distaste
for
that
part
of
the
subject
and
goes
to
the
luncheon
table
for
a
comfortable
chair
putting
down
her
book
and
sunshade
crampton
following
her
with
his
eyes
do
you
really
mean
what
you
are
saying
gloria
turning
on
him
quickly
and
severely
excuse
me
that
is
an
uncivil
question
i
am
speaking
seriously
to
you
and
i
expect
you
to
take
me
seriously
she
takes
one
of
the
luncheon
chairs
turns
it
away
from
the
table
and
sits
down
a
little
wearily
saying
can
you
not
discuss
this
matter
coolly
and
rationally
crampton
coolly
and
rationally
no
i
ca
do
you
understand
that
i
ca
gloria
emphatically
no
that
i
c
a
n
n
o
t
understand
i
have
no
sympathy
with
crampton
shrinking
nervously
stop
do
say
anything
more
yet
you
do
know
what
you
doing
do
you
want
to
drive
me
mad
she
frowns
finding
such
petulance
intolerable
he
adds
hastily
no
i
not
angry
indeed
i
not
wait
wait
give
me
a
little
time
to
think
he
stands
for
a
moment
screwing
and
clinching
his
brows
and
hands
in
his
perplexity
then
takes
the
end
chair
from
the
luncheon
table
and
sits
down
beside
her
saying
with
a
touching
effort
to
be
gentle
and
patient
now
i
think
i
have
it
at
least
i
try
gloria
firmly
you
see
everything
comes
right
if
we
only
think
it
resolutely
out
crampton
in
sudden
dread
no
do
think
i
want
you
to
feel
the
only
thing
that
can
help
us
listen
do
you
but
first
i
forgot
what
your
name
i
mean
you
pet
name
they
ca
very
well
call
you
sophronia
gloria
with
astonished
disgust
sophronia
my
name
is
gloria
i
am
always
called
by
it
crampton
his
temper
rising
again
your
name
is
sophronia
girl
you
were
called
after
your
aunt
sophronia
my
sister
she
gave
you
your
first
bible
with
your
name
written
in
it
gloria
then
my
mother
gave
me
a
new
name
crampton
angrily
she
had
no
right
to
do
it
i
will
not
allow
this
gloria
you
had
no
right
to
give
me
your
sister
name
i
do
know
her
crampton
you
talking
nonsense
there
are
bounds
to
what
i
will
put
up
with
i
will
not
have
it
do
you
hear
that
gloria
rising
warningly
are
you
resolved
to
quarrel
crampton
terrified
pleading
no
no
sit
down
sit
down
wo
you
she
looks
at
him
keeping
him
in
suspense
he
forces
himself
to
utter
the
obnoxious
name
gloria
she
marks
her
satisfaction
with
a
slight
tightening
of
the
lips
and
sits
down
there
you
see
i
only
want
to
shew
you
that
i
am
your
father
my
my
dear
child
the
endearment
is
so
plaintively
inept
that
she
smiles
in
spite
of
herself
and
resigns
herself
to
indulge
him
a
little
listen
now
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this
do
you
remember
me
at
all
you
were
only
a
tiny
child
when
you
were
taken
away
from
me
but
you
took
plenty
of
notice
of
things
you
remember
someone
whom
you
loved
or
shyly
at
least
liked
in
a
childish
way
come
someone
who
let
you
stay
in
his
study
and
look
at
his
toy
boats
as
you
thought
them
he
looks
anxiously
into
her
face
for
some
response
and
continues
less
hopefully
and
more
urgently
someone
who
let
you
do
as
you
liked
there
and
never
said
a
word
to
you
except
to
tell
you
that
you
must
sit
still
and
not
speak
someone
who
was
something
that
no
one
else
was
to
you
who
was
your
father
gloria
unmoved
if
you
describe
things
to
me
no
doubt
i
shall
presently
imagine
that
i
remember
them
but
i
really
remember
nothing
crampton
wistfully
has
your
mother
never
told
you
anything
about
me
gloria
she
has
never
mentioned
your
name
to
me
he
groans
involuntarily
she
looks
at
him
rather
contemptuously
and
continues
except
once
and
then
she
did
remind
me
of
something
i
had
forgotten
crampton
looking
up
hopefully
what
was
that
gloria
mercilessly
the
whip
you
bought
to
beat
me
with
crampton
gnashing
his
teeth
oh
to
bring
that
up
against
me
to
turn
from
me
when
you
need
never
have
known
under
a
grinding
agonized
breath
curse
her
gloria
springing
up
you
wretch
with
intense
emphasis
you
wretch
you
dare
curse
my
mother
crampton
stop
or
you
be
sorry
afterwards
i
your
father
gloria
how
i
hate
the
name
how
i
love
the
name
of
mother
you
had
better
go
crampton
i
i
choking
you
want
to
kill
me
some
i
his
voice
stifles
he
is
almost
in
a
fit
gloria
going
up
to
the
balustrade
with
cool
quick
resourcefulness
and
calling
over
to
the
beach
valentine
valentine
answering
from
below
yes
gloria
come
here
a
moment
please
crampton
wants
you
she
returns
to
the
table
and
pours
out
a
glass
of
water
crampton
recovering
his
speech
no
let
me
alone
i
do
want
him
i
all
right
i
tell
you
i
need
neither
his
help
nor
yours
he
rises
and
pulls
himself
together
as
you
say
i
had
better
go
he
puts
on
his
hat
is
that
your
last
word
gloria
i
hope
so
he
looks
stubbornly
at
her
for
a
moment
nods
grimly
as
if
he
agreed
to
that
and
goes
into
the
hotel
she
looks
at
him
with
equal
steadiness
until
he
disappears
when
she
makes
a
gesture
of
relief
and
turns
to
speak
to
valentine
who
comes
running
up
the
steps
valentine
panting
what
the
matter
looking
round
crampton
gloria
gone
valentine
face
lights
up
with
sudden
joy
dread
and
mischief
he
has
just
realized
that
he
is
alone
with
gloria
she
continues
indifferently
i
thought
he
was
ill
but
he
recovered
himself
he
would
wait
for
you
i
am
sorry
she
goes
for
her
book
and
parasol
valentine
so
much
the
better
he
gets
on
my
nerves
after
a
while
pretending
to
forget
himself
how
could
that
man
have
so
beautiful
a
daughter
gloria
taken
aback
for
a
moment
then
answering
him
with
polite
but
intentional
contempt
that
seems
to
be
an
attempt
at
what
is
called
a
pretty
speech
let
me
say
at
once
valentine
that
pretty
speeches
make
very
sickly
conversation
pray
let
us
be
friends
if
we
are
to
be
friends
in
a
sensible
and
wholesome
way
i
have
no
intention
of
getting
married
and
unless
you
are
content
to
accept
that
state
of
things
we
had
much
better
not
cultivate
each
other
acquaintance
valentine
cautiously
i
see
may
i
ask
just
this
one
question
is
your
objection
an
objection
to
marriage
as
an
institution
or
merely
an
objection
to
marrying
me
personally
gloria
i
do
not
know
you
well
enough
valentine
to
have
any
opinion
on
the
subject
of
your
personal
merits
she
turns
away
from
him
with
infinite
indifference
and
sits
down
with
her
book
on
the
garden
seat
i
do
not
think
the
conditions
of
marriage
at
present
are
such
as
any
woman
can
accept
valentine
instantly
changing
his
tone
for
one
of
cordial
sincerity
as
if
he
frankly
accepted
her
terms
and
was
delighted
and
reassured
by
her
principles
oh
then
that
a
point
of
sympathy
between
us
already
i
quite
agree
with
you
the
conditions
are
most
unfair
he
takes
off
his
hat
and
throws
it
gaily
on
the
iron
table
no
what
i
want
is
to
get
rid
of
all
that
nonsense
he
sits
down
beside
her
so
naturally
that
she
does
not
think
of
objecting
and
proceeds
with
enthusiasm
you
think
it
a
horrible
thing
that
a
man
and
a
woman
can
hardly
know
one
another
without
being
supposed
to
have
designs
of
that
kind
as
if
there
were
no
other
interests
no
other
subjects
of
conversation
as
if
women
were
capable
of
nothing
better
gloria
interested
ah
now
you
are
beginning
to
talk
humanly
and
sensibly
valentine
valentine
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
at
the
success
of
his
guile
of
course
two
intelligent
people
like
us
is
it
pleasant
in
this
stupid
world
to
meet
with
someone
on
the
same
plane
someone
with
an
unprejudiced
enlightened
mind
gloria
earnestly
i
hope
to
meet
many
such
people
in
england
valentine
dubiously
hm
there
are
a
good
many
people
here
nearly
forty
millions
they
not
all
consumptive
members
of
the
highly
educated
classes
like
the
people
in
madeira
gloria
now
full
of
her
subject
oh
everybody
is
stupid
and
prejudiced
in
madeira
weak
sentimental
creatures
i
hate
weakness
and
i
hate
sentiment
valentine
that
what
makes
you
so
inspiring
gloria
with
a
slight
laugh
am
i
inspiring
valentine
yes
strength
infectious
gloria
weakness
is
i
know
valentine
with
conviction
y
o
u
strong
do
you
know
that
you
changed
the
world
for
me
this
morning
i
was
in
the
dumps
thinking
of
my
unpaid
rent
frightened
about
the
future
when
you
came
in
i
was
dazzled
her
brow
clouds
a
little
he
goes
on
quickly
that
was
silly
of
course
but
really
and
truly
something
happened
to
me
explain
it
how
you
will
my
blood
got
he
hesitates
trying
to
think
of
a
sufficiently
unimpassioned
word
oxygenated
my
muscles
braced
my
mind
cleared
my
courage
rose
that
odd
is
it
considering
that
i
am
not
at
all
a
sentimental
man
gloria
uneasily
rising
let
us
go
back
to
the
beach
valentine
darkly
looking
up
at
her
what
you
feel
it
too
gloria
feel
what
valentine
dread
gloria
dread
valentine
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
it
came
over
me
suddenly
just
before
you
proposed
that
we
should
run
away
to
the
others
gloria
amazed
that
strange
very
strange
i
had
the
same
presentiment
valentine
how
extraordinary
rising
well
shall
we
run
away
gloria
run
away
oh
no
that
would
be
childish
she
sits
down
again
he
resumes
his
seat
beside
her
and
watches
her
with
a
gravely
sympathetic
air
she
is
thoughtful
and
a
little
troubled
as
she
adds
i
wonder
what
is
the
scientific
explanation
of
those
fancies
that
cross
us
occasionally
valentine
ah
i
wonder
it
a
curiously
helpless
sensation
is
it
gloria
rebelling
against
the
word
helpless
valentine
yes
as
if
nature
after
allowing
us
to
belong
to
ourselves
and
do
what
we
judged
right
and
reasonable
for
all
these
years
were
suddenly
lifting
her
great
hand
to
take
us
her
two
little
children
by
the
scruff
of
our
little
necks
and
use
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
for
her
own
purposes
in
her
own
way
gloria
is
that
rather
fanciful
valentine
with
a
new
and
startling
transition
to
a
tone
of
utter
recklessness
i
do
know
i
do
care
bursting
out
reproachfully
oh
miss
clandon
miss
clandon
how
could
you
gloria
what
have
i
done
valentine
thrown
this
enchantment
on
me
i
honestly
trying
to
be
sensible
scientific
everything
that
you
wish
me
to
be
but
but
oh
do
you
see
what
you
have
set
to
work
in
my
imagination
gloria
with
indignant
scornful
sternness
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
be
so
foolish
so
vulgar
as
to
say
love
valentine
with
ironical
haste
to
disclaim
such
a
weakness
no
no
no
not
love
we
know
better
than
that
let
call
it
chemistry
you
deny
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
chemical
action
chemical
affinity
chemical
combination
the
most
irresistible
of
all
natural
forces
well
you
attracting
me
irresistibly
chemically
gloria
contemptuously
nonsense
valentine
of
course
it
nonsense
you
stupid
girl
gloria
recoils
in
outraged
surprise
yes
stupid
girl
t
h
a
t
a
scientific
fact
anyhow
you
a
prig
a
feminine
prig
that
what
you
are
rising
now
i
suppose
you
done
with
me
for
ever
he
goes
to
the
iron
table
and
takes
up
his
hat
gloria
with
elaborate
calm
sitting
up
like
a
posing
to
be
photographed
that
shows
how
very
little
you
understand
my
real
character
i
am
not
in
the
least
offended
he
pauses
and
puts
his
hat
down
again
i
am
always
willing
to
be
told
of
my
own
defects
valentine
by
my
friends
even
when
they
are
as
absurdly
mistaken
about
me
as
you
are
i
have
many
faults
very
serious
faults
of
character
and
temper
but
if
there
is
one
thing
that
i
am
not
it
is
what
you
call
a
prig
she
closes
her
lips
trimly
and
looks
steadily
and
challengingly
at
him
as
she
sits
more
collectedly
than
ever
valentine
returning
to
the
end
of
the
garden
seat
to
confront
her
more
emphatically
oh
yes
you
are
my
reason
tells
me
so
my
knowledge
tells
me
so
my
experience
tells
me
so
gloria
excuse
my
reminding
you
that
your
reason
and
your
knowledge
and
your
experience
are
not
infallible
at
least
i
hope
not
valentine
i
must
believe
them
unless
you
wish
me
to
believe
my
eyes
my
heart
my
instincts
my
imagination
which
are
all
telling
me
the
most
monstrous
lies
about
you
gloria
the
collectedness
beginning
to
relax
lies
valentine
obstinately
yes
lies
he
sits
down
again
beside
her
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
gloria
that
is
ridiculous
and
rather
personal
valentine
of
course
it
ridiculous
well
that
what
my
eyes
tell
me
gloria
makes
a
movement
of
contemptuous
protest
no
i
not
flattering
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
it
she
is
ashamed
to
find
that
this
does
not
quite
please
her
either
do
you
think
that
if
you
were
to
turn
away
in
disgust
from
my
weakness
i
should
sit
down
here
and
cry
like
a
child
gloria
beginning
to
find
that
she
must
speak
shortly
and
pointedly
to
keep
her
voice
steady
why
should
you
pray
valentine
with
a
stir
of
feeling
beginning
to
agitate
his
voice
of
course
not
i
not
such
an
idiot
and
yet
my
heart
tells
me
i
should
my
fool
of
a
heart
but
i
argue
with
my
heart
and
bring
it
to
reason
if
i
loved
you
a
thousand
times
i
force
myself
to
look
the
truth
steadily
in
the
face
after
all
it
easy
to
be
sensible
the
facts
are
the
facts
what
this
place
it
not
heaven
it
the
marine
hotel
what
the
time
it
not
eternity
it
about
half
past
one
in
the
afternoon
what
am
i
a
dentist
a
five
shilling
dentist
gloria
and
i
am
a
feminine
prig
valentine
passionately
no
no
i
ca
face
that
i
must
have
one
illusion
left
the
illusion
about
you
i
love
you
he
turns
towards
her
as
if
the
impulse
to
touch
her
were
ungovernable
she
rises
and
stands
on
her
guard
wrathfully
he
springs
up
impatiently
and
retreats
a
step
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
an
idiot
you
do
understand
i
might
as
well
talk
to
the
stones
on
the
beach
he
turns
away
discouraged
gloria
reassured
by
his
withdrawal
and
a
little
remorseful
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
mean
to
be
unsympathetic
valentine
but
what
can
i
say
valentine
returning
to
her
with
all
his
recklessness
of
manner
replaced
by
an
engaging
and
chivalrous
respect
you
can
say
nothing
miss
clandon
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
my
own
fault
or
rather
my
own
bad
luck
you
see
it
all
depended
on
your
naturally
liking
me
she
is
about
to
speak
he
stops
her
deprecatingly
oh
i
know
you
must
tell
me
whether
you
like
me
or
not
but
gloria
her
principles
up
in
arms
at
once
must
not
why
not
i
am
a
free
woman
why
should
i
not
tell
you
valentine
pleading
in
terror
and
retreating
do
i
afraid
to
hear
gloria
no
longer
scornful
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
think
you
are
sentimental
and
a
little
foolish
but
i
like
you
valentine
dropping
into
the
iron
chair
as
if
crushed
then
it
all
over
he
becomes
the
picture
of
despair
gloria
puzzled
approaching
him
but
why
valentine
because
liking
is
not
enough
now
that
i
think
down
into
it
seriously
i
do
know
whether
i
like
you
or
not
gloria
looking
down
at
him
with
wondering
concern
i
sorry
valentine
in
an
agony
of
restrained
passion
oh
do
pity
me
your
voice
is
tearing
my
heart
to
pieces
let
me
alone
gloria
you
go
down
into
the
very
depths
of
me
troubling
and
stirring
me
i
ca
struggle
with
it
i
ca
tell
you
gloria
breaking
down
suddenly
oh
stop
telling
me
what
you
feel
i
ca
bear
it
valentine
springing
up
triumphantly
the
agonized
voice
now
solid
ringing
and
jubilant
ah
it
come
at
last
my
moment
of
courage
he
seizes
her
hands
she
looks
at
him
in
terror
our
moment
of
courage
he
draws
her
to
him
kisses
her
with
impetuous
strength
and
laughs
boyishly
now
you
done
it
gloria
it
all
over
we
in

at

gloria
returning
yes
clandon
you

i
never

almost
passionately

smiling
but
embarrassed
my

you
are
getting
quite
sentimental

crouching
there
with

face
averted
waiter
placing
the

thought
so
curious
how
the
nerves

to
give
out
in
the
afternoon
without
a
cup
of
tea
he
fetches
the
tea
table
and
places
it
in

have
been
out
in

pleasant
on

fine

couple
of
chairs

one
at

extent

her
scorn
dolly
but
he
was
philip
she
appeared
to
like
it
dolly
as
far
as
we
could
judge
stopping
phil
who
is
about
to
pour
out
another
cup
no
you
sworn
off
two
cups
clandon
much
troubled
children
you
must
not
be
here
when
valentine
comes
i
must
speak
very
seriously
to
him
about
this
philip
to
ask
him
his
intentions
what
a
violation
of
twentieth
century
principles
dolly
quite
right
mamma
bring
him
to
book
make
the
most
of
the
nineteenth
century
while
it
lasts
philip
sh
here
he
is
valentine
comes
in
valentine
very
sorry
to
be
late
for
tea
clandon
she
takes
up
the
no
thank
you
i
never
take
any
no
doubt
miss
dolly
and
phil
have
explained
what
happened
to
me
philip
momentously
rising
yes
valentine
we
have
explained
dolly
significantly
also
rising
we
have
explained
very
thoroughly
philip
it
was
our
duty
very
seriously
come
dolly
he
offers
dolly
his
arm
which
she
takes
they
look
sadly
at
him
and
go
out
gravely
arm
in
arm
valentine
stares
after
them
puzzled
then
looks
at
clandon
for
an
explanation
clandon
rising
and
leaving
the
tea
table
will
you
sit
down
valentine
i
want
to
speak
to
you
a
little
if
you
will
allow
me
valentine
sits
down
slowly
on
the
ottoman
his
conscience
presaging
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
clandon
takes
phil
chair
and
seats
herself
deliberately
at
a
convenient
distance
from
him
i
must
begin
by
throwing
myself
somewhat
at
your
consideration
i
am
going
to
speak
of
a
subject
of
which
i
know
very
little
perhaps
nothing
i
mean
love
valentine
love
clandon
yes
love
oh
you
need
not
look
so
alarmed
as
that
valentine
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
valentine
overwhelmed
oh
really
recovering
himself
i
should
be
only
too
proud
if
you
were
clandon
thank
you
valentine
but
i
am
too
old
to
begin
valentine
begin
have
you
never
clandon
never
my
case
is
a
very
common
one
valentine
i
married
before
i
was
old
enough
to
know
what
i
was
doing
as
you
have
seen
for
yourself
the
result
was
a
bitter
disappointment
for
both
my
husband
and
myself
so
you
see
though
i
am
a
married
woman
i
have
never
been
in
love
i
have
never
had
a
love
affair
and
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
valentine
what
i
have
seen
of
the
love
affairs
of
other
people
has
not
led
me
to
regret
that
deficiency
in
my
experience
valentine
looking
very
glum
glances
sceptically
at
her
and
says
nothing
her
color
rises
a
little
and
she
adds
with
restrained
anger
you
do
not
believe
me
valentine
confused
at
having
his
thought
read
oh
why
not
why
not
clandon
let
me
tell
you
valentine
that
a
life
devoted
to
the
cause
of
humanity
has
enthusiasms
and
passions
to
offer
which
far
transcend
the
selfish
personal
infatuations
and
sentimentalities
of
romance
those
are
not
your
enthusiasms
and
passions
i
take
it
valentine
quite
aware
that
she
despises
him
for
it
answers
in
the
negative
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
i
thought
not
well
i
am
equally
at
a
disadvantage
in
discussing
those
affairs
of
the
heart
in
which
you
appear
to
be
an
expert
valentine
restlessly
what
are
you
driving
at
clandon
clandon
i
think
you
know
valentine
gloria
clandon
yes
gloria
valentine
surrendering
well
yes
i
in
love
with
gloria
interposing
as
she
is
about
to
speak
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
i
no
money
clandon
i
care
very
little
about
money
valentine
valentine
then
you
very
different
to
all
the
other
mothers
who
have
interviewed
me
clandon
ah
now
we
are
coming
to
it
valentine
you
are
an
old
hand
at
this
he
opens
his
mouth
to
protest
she
cuts
him
short
with
some
indignation
oh
do
you
think
little
as
i
understand
these
matters
that
i
have
not
common
sense
enough
to
know
that
a
man
who
could
make
as
much
way
in
one
interview
with
such
a
woman
as
my
daughter
can
hardly
be
a
novice
valentine
i
assure
you
clandon
stopping
him
i
am
not
blaming
you
valentine
it
is
gloria
business
to
take
care
of
herself
and
you
have
a
right
to
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
but
valentine
protesting
amuse
myself
oh
clandon
clandon
relentlessly
on
your
honor
valentine
are
you
in
earnest
valentine
desperately
on
my
honor
i
am
in
earnest
she
looks
searchingly
at
him
his
sense
of
humor
gets
the
better
of
him
and
he
adds
quaintly
only
i
always
have
been
in
earnest
and
yet
here
i
am
you
see
clandon
this
is
just
what
i
suspected
severely
valentine
you
are
one
of
those
men
who
play
with
women
affections
valentine
well
why
not
if
the
cause
of
humanity
is
the
only
thing
worth
being
serious
about
however
i
understand
rising
and
taking
his
hat
with
formal
politeness
you
wish
me
to
discontinue
my
visits
clandon
no
i
am
sensible
enough
to
be
well
aware
that
best
chance
of
escape
from
you
now
is
to
become
better
acquainted
with
you
valentine
unaffectedly
alarmed
oh
do
say
that
clandon
you
do
think
that
do
you
clandon
i
have
great
faith
valentine
in
the
sound
training
gloria
mind
has
had
since
she
was
a
child
valentine
amazingly
relieved
oh
that
all
right
he
sits
down
again
and
throws
his
hat
flippantly
aside
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
no
longer
anything
to
fear
clandon
indignant
at
his
assurance
what
do
you
mean
valentine
turning
confidentially
to
her
come
shall
i
teach
you
something
clandon
clandon
stiffly
i
am
always
willing
to
learn
valentine
have
you
ever
studied
the
subject
of
gunnery
artillery
cannons
and
and
so
on
clandon
has
gunnery
anything
to
do
with
gloria
valentine
a
great
deal
by
way
of
illustration
during
this
whole
century
my
dear
clandon
the
progress
of
artillery
has
been
a
duel
between
the
maker
of
cannons
and
the
maker
of
armor
plates
to
keep
the
cannon
balls
out
you
build
a
ship
proof
against
the
best
gun
known
somebody
makes
a
better
gun
and
sinks
your
ship
you
build
a
heavier
ship
proof
against
that
gun
somebody
makes
a
heavier
gun
and
sinks
you
again
and
so
on
well
the
duel
of
sex
is
just
like
that
clandon
the
duel
of
sex
valentine
yes
you
heard
of
the
duel
of
sex
have
you
oh
i
forgot
you
been
in
madeira
the
expression
has
come
up
since
your
time
need
i
explain
it
clandon
contemptuously
no
valentine
of
course
not
now
what
happens
in
the
duel
of
sex
the
old
fashioned
mother
received
an
old
fashioned
education
to
protect
her
against
the
wiles
of
man
well
you
know
the
result
the
old
fashioned
man
got
round
her
the
old
fashioned
woman
resolved
to
protect
her
daughter
more
effectually
to
find
some
armor
too
strong
for
the
old
fashioned
man
so
she
gave
her
daughter
a
scientific
education
your
plan
that
was
a
corker
for
the
old
fashioned
man
he
said
it
fair
unwomanly
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
that
did
do
him
any
good
so
he
had
to
give
up
his
old
fashioned
plan
of
attack
you
know
going
down
on
his
knees
and
swearing
to
love
honor
and
obey
and
so
on
clandon
excuse
me
that
was
what
the
woman
swore
valentine
was
it
ah
perhaps
you
right
yes
of
course
it
was
well
what
did
the
man
do
just
what
the
artillery
man
does
went
one
better
than
the
woman
educated
himself
scientifically
and
beat
her
at
that
game
just
as
he
had
beaten
her
at
the
old
game
i
learnt
how
to
circumvent
the
women
rights
woman
before
i
was
three
it
all
been
found
out
long
ago
you
see
my
methods
are
thoroughly
modern
clandon
with
quiet
disgust
no
doubt
valentine
but
for
that
very
reason
there
one
sort
of
girl
against
whom
they
are
of
no
use
clandon
pray
which
sort
valentine
the
thoroughly
old
fashioned
girl
if
you
had
brought
up
gloria
in
the
old
way
it
would
have
taken
me
eighteen
months
to
get
to
the
point
i
got
to
this
afternoon
in
eighteen
minutes
yes
clandon
the
higher
education
of
women
delivered
gloria
into
my
hands
and
it
was
you
who
taught
her
to
believe
in
the
higher
education
of
women
clandon
rising
valentine
you
are
very
clever
valentine
rising
also
oh
clandon
clandon
and
you
have
taught
me
n
o
t
h
i
n
valentine
horrified
oh
may
i
see
her
before
i
go
clandon
i
am
afraid
she
will
not
return
until
you
have
gone
valentine
she
left
the
room
expressly
to
avoid
you
valentine
thoughtfully
that
a
good
sign
he
bows
and
makes
for
the
door
apparently
well
satisfied
clandon
alarmed
why
do
you
think
it
a
good
sign
valentine
turning
near
the
door
because
i
am
mortally
afraid
of
her
and
it
looks
as
if
she
were
mortally
afraid
of
me
he
turns
to
go
and
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
gloria
who
has
just
entered
she
looks
steadfastly
at
him
he
stares
helplessly
at
her
then
round
at
clandon
then
at
gloria
again
completely
at
a
loss
gloria
white
and
controlling
herself
with
difficulty
mother
is
what
dolly
told
me
true
clandon
what
did
she
tell
you
dear
gloria
that
you
have
been
speaking
about
me
to
this
gentleman
valentine
murmuring
this
gentleman
oh
clandon
sharply
valentine
can
you
hold
your
tongue
for
a
moment
he
looks
piteously
at
them
then
with
a
despairing
shrug
goes
back
to
the
ottoman
and
throws
his
hat
on
it
gloria
confronting
her
mother
with
deep
reproach
mother
what
right
had
you
to
do
it
clandon
i
do
think
i
have
said
anything
i
have
no
right
to
say
gloria
valentine
confirming
her
officiously
nothing
nothing
whatever
gloria
looks
at
him
with
unspeakable
indignation
i
beg
your
pardon
he
sits
down
ignominiously
on
the
ottoman
gloria
i
can
not
believe
that
any
one
has
any
right
even
to
think
about
things
that
concern
me
only
she
turns
away
from
them
to
conceal
a
painful
struggle
with
her
emotion
clandon
my
dear
if
i
have
wounded
your
pride
gloria
turning
on
them
for
a
moment
my
p
r
i
d
e
my
pride
oh
gone
i
have
learnt
now
that
i
have
no
strength
to
be
proud
of
turning
away
again
but
if
a
woman
can
not
protect
herself
no
one
can
protect
her
no
one
has
any
right
to
try
not
even
her
mother
i
know
i
have
lost
your
confidence
just
as
i
have
lost
this
man
respect
she
stops
to
master
a
sob
valentine
under
his
breath
this
man
murmuring
again
oh
clandon
in
an
undertone
pray
be
silent
sir
gloria
continuing
but
i
have
at
least
the
right
to
be
left
alone
in
my
disgrace
i
am
one
of
those
weak
creatures
born
to
be
mastered
by
the
first
man
whose
eye
is
caught
by
them
and
i
must
fulfill
my
destiny
i
suppose
at
least
spare
me
the
humiliation
of
trying
to
save
me
she
sits
down
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
valentine
jumping
up
look
here
clandon
va
valentine
recklessly
no
i
will
speak
i
been
silent
for
nearly
thirty
seconds
he
goes
up
to
gloria
miss
clandon
gloria
bitterly
oh
not
miss
clandon
you
have
found
that
it
is
quite
safe
to
call
me
gloria
valentine
no
i
wo
you
throw
it
in
my
teeth
afterwards
and
accuse
me
of
disrespect
i
say
it
a
heartbreaking
falsehood
that
i
do
respect
you
it
true
that
i
did
respect
your
old
pride
why
should
i
it
was
nothing
but
cowardice
i
did
respect
your
intellect
i
a
better
one
myself
it
a
masculine
specialty
but
when
the
depths
stirred
when
my
moment
came
when
you
made
me
brave
ah
then
then
t
h
e
n
gloria
then
you
respected
me
i
suppose
valentine
no
i
did
i
adored
you
she
rises
quickly
and
turns
her
back
on
him
and
you
can
never
take
that
moment
away
from
me
so
now
i
do
care
what
happens
he
comes
down
the
room
addressing
a
cheerful
explanation
to
nobody
in
particular
i
perfectly
aware
that
talking
nonsense
i
ca
help
it
to
mrs
clandon
i
love
gloria
and
there
an
end
of
it
clandon
emphatically
valentine
you
are
a
most
dangerous
man
gloria
come
here
gloria
wondering
a
little
at
the
command
obeys
and
stands
with
drooping
head
on
her
mother
right
hand
valentine
being
on
the
opposite
side
clandon
then
begins
with
intense
scorn
ask
this
man
whom
you
have
inspired
and
made
brave
how
many
women
have
inspired
him
before
gloria
looks
up
suddenly
with
a
flash
of
jealous
anger
and
amazement
how
many
times
he
has
laid
the
trap
in
which
he
has
caught
you
how
often
he
has
baited
it
with
the
same
speeches
how
much
practice
it
has
taken
to
make
him
perfect
in
his
chosen
part
in
life
as
the
duellist
of
sex
valentine
this
is
fair
you
abusing
my
confidence
clandon
clandon
ask
him
gloria
gloria
in
a
flush
of
rage
going
over
to
him
with
her
fists
clenched
is
that
true
valentine
do
be
angry
gloria
interrupting
him
implacably
is
it
true
did
you
ever
say
that
before
did
you
ever
feel
that
before
for
another
woman
valentine
bluntly
yes
gloria
raises
her
clenched
hands
clandon
horrified
springing
to
her
side
and
catching
her
uplifted
arm
gloria
my
dear
you
forgetting
yourself
gloria
with
a
deep
expiration
slowly
relaxes
her
threatening
attitude
valentine
remember
a
man
power
of
love
and
admiration
is
like
any
other
of
his
powers
he
has
to
throw
it
away
many
times
before
he
learns
what
is
really
worthy
of
it
clandon
another
of
the
old
speeches
gloria
take
care
valentine
remonstrating
oh
gloria
to
clandon
with
contemptuous
do
you
think
i
need
to
be
warned
now
to
valentine
you
have
tried
to
make
me
love
you
valentine
i
have
gloria
well
you
have
succeeded
in
making
me
hate
you
passionately
valentine
philosophically
it
surprising
how
little
difference
there
is
between
the
two
gloria
turns
indignantly
away
from
him
he
continues
to
clandon
i
know
men
whose
wives
love
them
and
they
go
on
exactly
like
that
clandon
excuse
me
valentine
but
had
you
not
better
go
gloria
you
need
not
send
him
away
on
my
account
mother
he
is
nothing
to
me
now
and
he
will
amuse
dolly
and
phil
she
sits
down
with
slighting
indifference
at
the
end
of
the
table
nearest
the
window
valentine
gaily
of
course
that
the
sensible
way
of
looking
at
it
come
clandon
you
ca
quarrel
with
a
mere
butterfly
like
me
clandon
i
very
greatly
mistrust
you
valentine
but
i
do
not
like
to
think
that
your
unfortunate
levity
of
disposition
is
mere
shamelessness
and
worthlessness
gloria
to
herself
but
aloud
it
is
shameless
and
it
is
worthless
clandon
so
perhaps
we
had
better
send
for
phil
and
dolly
and
allow
you
to
end
your
visit
in
the
ordinary
way
valentine
as
if
she
had
paid
him
the
highest
compliment
you
overwhelm
me
clandon
thank
you
the
waiter
enters
waiter
mccomas
clandon
oh
certainly
bring
him
in
waiter
he
wishes
to
see
you
in
the
clandon
why
not
here
waiter
well
if
you
will
excuse
my
mentioning
it
i
think
mccomas
feels
that
he
would
get
fairer
play
if
he
could
speak
to
you
away
from
the
younger
members
of
your
family
clandon
tell
him
they
are
not
here
waiter
they
are
within
sight
of
the
door
and
very
watchful
for
some
reason
or
other
clandon
going
oh
very
well
i
go
to
him
waiter
holding
the
door
open
for
her
thank
you
she
goes
out
he
comes
back
into
the
room
and
meets
the
eye
of
valentine
who
wants
him
to
go
all
right
sir
only
the
sir
taking
the
tray
excuse
me
sir
thank
you
sir
he
goes
out
valentine
to
gloria
look
here
you
will

now
begin
a
new
chapter
in
your
life
dolly
chapter
seventeen
or
thereabouts
i
should
imagine
valentine
much
put
out
by
this
pleasantry
no
do
say
things
like
that
that
just
the
sort
of
thoughtless
remark
that
makes
a
lot
of
mischief
dolly
oh
indeed
hmhm
philip
ahah
he
goes
to
the
hearth
and
plants
himself
there
in
his
best
attitude
mccomas
looking
very
serious
comes
in
quickly
with
clandon
whose
first
anxiety
is
about
gloria
she
looks
round
to
see
where
she
is
and
is
going
to
join
her
at
the
window
when
gloria
comes
down
to
meet
her
with
a
marked
air
of
trust
and
affection
finally
clandon
takes
her
former
seat
and
gloria
posts
herself
behind
it
mccomas
on
his
way
to
the
ottoman
is
hailed
by
dolly
dolly
what
cheer
finch
mccomas
sternly
very
serious
news
from
your
father
miss
clandon
very
serious
news
indeed
he
crosses
to
the
ottoman
and
sits
down
dolly
looking
deeply
impressed
follows
him
and
sits
beside
him
on
his
right
valentine
perhaps
i
had
better
go
mccomas
by
no
means
valentine
you
are
deeply
concerned
in
this
valentine
takes
a
chair
from
the
table
and
sits
astride
of
it
leaning
over
the
back
near
the
ottoman
clandon
your
husband
demands
the
custody
of
his
two
younger
children
who
are
not
of
age
clandon
in
quick
alarm
looks
instinctively
to
see
if
dolly
is
safe
dolly
touched
oh
how
nice
of
him
he
likes
us
mamma
mccomas
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
disabuse
you
of
any
such
idea
miss
dorothea
dolly
cooing
ecstatically
nestling
against
his
shoulder
quite
overcome
oh
finch
mccomas
nervously
moving
away
no
no
no
no
clandon
remonstrating
d
e
a
r
e
s
t
dolly
to
mccomas
the
deed
of
separation
gives
me
the
custody
of
the
children
mccomas
it
also
contains
a
covenant
that
you
are
not
to
approach
or
molest
him
in
any
way
clandon
well
have
i
done
so
mccomas
whether
the
behavior
of
your
younger
children
amounts
to
legal
molestation
is
a
question
on
which
it
may
be
necessary
to
take
opinion
at
all
events
crampton
not
only
claims
to
have
been
molested
but
he
believes
that
he
was
brought
here
by
a
plot
in
which
valentine
acted
as
your
agent
valentine
what
that
eh
mccomas
he
alleges
that
you
drugged
him
valentine
valentine
so
i
did
they
are
astonished
mccomas
but
what
did
you
do
that
for
dolly
five
shillings
extra
mccomas
to
dolly
i
must
really
ask
you
miss
clandon
not
to
interrupt
this
very
serious
conversation
with
irrelevant
interjections
vehemently
i
insist
on
having
earnest
matters
earnestly
and
reverently
discussed
this
outburst
produces
an
apologetic
silence
and
puts
mccomas
himself
out
of
countenance
he
coughs
and
starts
afresh
addressing
himself
to
gloria
miss
clandon
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
your
father
has
also
persuaded
himself
that
valentine
wishes
to
marry
you
valentine
interposing
adroitly
i
do
mccomas
offended
in
that
case
sir
you
must
not
be
surprised
to
find
yourself
regarded
by
the
young
lady
father
as
a
fortune
hunter
valentine
so
i
am
do
you
expect
my
wife
to
live
on
what
i
earn
a
week
mccomas
revolted
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
sir
i
shall
return
and
tell
crampton
that
this
family
is
no
place
for
a
father
he
makes
for
the
door
clandon
with
quiet
authority
finch
he
halts
if
valentine
can
not
be
serious
you
can
sit
down
mccomas
after
a
brief
struggle
between
his
dignity
and
his
friendship
succumbs
seating
himself
this
time
midway
between
dolly
and
mrs
clandon
you
know
that
all
this
is
a
made
up
case
that
fergus
does
not
believe
in
it
any
more
than
you
do
now
give
me
your
real
advice
your
sincere
friendly
advice
you
know
i
have
always
trusted
your
judgment
i
promise
you
the
children
will
be
quiet
mccomas
resigning
himself
well
well
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
in
the
old
arrangement
with
your
husband
clandon
you
had
him
at
a
terrible
disadvantage
clandon
how
so
pray
mccomas
well
you
were
an
advanced
woman
accustomed
to
defy
public
opinion
and
with
no
regard
for
what
the
world
might
say
of
you
clandon
proud
of
it
yes
that
is
true
gloria
behind
the
chair
stoops
and
kisses
her
mother
hair
a
demonstration
which
disconcerts
her
extremely
mccomas
on
the
other
hand
clandon
your
husband
had
a
great
horror
of
anything
getting
into
the
papers
there
was
his
business
to
be
considered
as
well
as
the
prejudices
of
an
family
clandon
not
to
mention
his
own
prejudices
mccomas
now
no
doubt
he
behaved
badly
clandon
clandon
scornfully
no
doubt
mccomas
but
was
it
altogether
his
fault
clandon
was
it
mine
mccomas
hastily
no
of
course
not
gloria
observing
him
attentively
you
do
not
mean
that
mccomas
mccomas
my
dear
young
lady
you
pick
me
up
very
sharply
but
let
me
just
put
this
to
you
when
a
man
makes
an
unsuitable
marriage
fault
you
know
but
purely
accidental
incompatibility
of
tastes
when
he
is
deprived
by
that
misfortune
of
the
domestic
sympathy
which
i
take
it
is
what
a
man
marries
for
when
in
short
his
wife
is
rather
worse
than
no
wife
at
all
through
no
fault
of
his
own
of
course
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
if
he
makes
matters
worse
at
first
by
blaming
her
and
even
in
his
desperation
by
occasionally
drinking
himself
into
a
violent
condition
or
seeking
sympathy
elsewhere
clandon
i
did
not
blame
him
i
simply
rescued
myself
and
the
children
from
him
mccomas
yes
but
you
made
hard
terms
clandon
you
had
him
at
your
mercy
you
brought
him
to
his
knees
when
you
threatened
to
make
the
matter
public
by
applying
to
the
courts
for
a
judicial
separation
suppose
he
had
had
that
power
over
you
and
used
it
to
take
your
children
away
from
you
and
bring
them
up
in
ignorance
of
your
very
name
how
would
you
feel
what
would
you
do
well
wo
you
make
some
allowance
for
his
feelings
in
common
humanity
clandon
i
never
discovered
his
feelings
i
discovered
his
temper
and
his
she
shivers
the
rest
of
his
common
humanity
mccomas
wistfully
women
can
be
very
hard
clandon
valentine
that
true
gloria
angrily
be
silent
he
subsides
mccomas
rallying
all
his
forces
let
me
make
one
last
appeal
clandon
believe
me
there
are
men
who
have
a
good
deal
of
feeling
and
kind
feeling
too
which
they
are
not
able
to
express
what
you
miss
in
crampton
is
that
mere
veneer
of
civilization
the
art
of
shewing
worthless
attentions
and
paying
insincere
compliments
in
a
kindly
charming
way
if
you
lived
in
london
where
the
whole
system
is
one
of
false
and
you
may
know
a
man
for
twenty
years
without
finding
out
that
he
hates
you
like
poison
you
would
soon
have
your
eyes
opened
there
we
do
unkind
things
in
a
kind
way
we
say
bitter
things
in
a
sweet
voice
we
always
give
our
friends
chloroform
when
we
tear
them
to
pieces
but
think
of
the
other
side
of
it
think
of
the
people
who
do
kind
things
in
an
unkind
way
people
whose
touch
hurts
whose
voices
jar
whose
tempers
play
them
false
who
wound
and
worry
the
people
they
love
in
the
very
act
of
trying
to
conciliate
them
and
yet
who
need
affection
as
much
as
the
rest
of
us
crampton
has
an
abominable
temper
i
admit
he
has
no
manners
no
tact
no
grace
he
never
be
able
to
gain
anyone
affection
unless
they
will
take
his
desire
for
it
on
trust
is
he
to
have
none
not
even
pity
from
his
own
flesh
and
blood
dolly
quite
melted
oh
how
beautiful
finch
how
nice
of
you
philip
with
conviction
finch
this
is
eloquence
positive
eloquence
dolly
oh
mamma
let
us
give
him
another
chance
let
us
have
him
to
dinner
clandon
unmoved
no
dolly
i
hardly
got
any
lunch
my
dear
finch
there
is
not
the
least
use
in
talking
to
me
about
fergus
you
have
never
been
married
to
him
i
have
mccomas
to
gloria
miss
clandon
i
have
hitherto
refrained
from
appealing
to
you
because
if
what
crampton
told
me
to
be
true
you
have
been
more
merciless
even
than
your
mother
gloria
defiantly
you
appeal
from
her
strength
to
my
weakness
mccomas
not
your
weakness
miss
clandon
i
appeal
from
her
intellect
to
your
heart
gloria
i
have
learnt
to
mistrust
my
heart
with
an
angry
glance
at
valentine
i
would
tear
my
heart
and
throw
it
away
if
i
could
my
answer
to
you
is
my
mother
answer
she
goes
to
clandon
and
stands
with
her
arm
about
her
but
clandon
unable
to
endure
this
sort
of
demonstrativeness
disengages
herself
as
soon
as
she
can
without
hurting
gloria
feelings
mccomas
defeated
well
i
am
very
sorry
very
sorry
i
have
done
my
best
he
rises
and
prepares
to
go
deeply
dissatisfied
clandon
but
what
did
you
expect
finch
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
mccomas
the
first
step
for
both
you
and
crampton
is
to
obtain
opinion
as
to
whether
he
is
bound
by
the
deed
of
separation
or
not
now
why
not
obtain
this
opinion
at
once
and
have
a
friendly
meeting
her
face
hardens
or
shall
we
say
a
neutral
meeting
to
settle
the
difficulty
here
in
this
hotel
what
do
you
say
clandon
but
where
is
the
counsel
opinion
to
come
from
mccomas
it
has
dropped
down
on
us
out
of
the
clouds
on
my
way
back
here
from
crampton
i
met
a
most
eminent
a
man
whom
i
briefed
in
the
case
that
made
his
name
for
him
he
has
come
down
here
from
saturday
to
monday
for
the
sea
air
and
to
visit
a
relative
of
his
who
lives
here
he
has
been
good
enough
to
say
that
if
i
can
arrange
a
meeting
of
the
parties
he
will
come
and
help
us
with
his
opinion
now
do
let
us
seize
this
chance
of
a
quiet
friendly
family
adjustment
let
me
bring
my
friend
here
and
try
to
persuade
crampton
to
come
too
come
consent
clandon
rather
ominously
after
a
moment
consideration
finch
i
do
want
counsel
opinion
because
i
intend
to
be
guided
by
my
own
opinion
i
do
want
to
meet
fergus
again
because
i
do
like
him
and
do
believe
the
meeting
will
do
any
good
however
rising
you
have
persuaded
the
children
that
he
is
not
quite
hopeless
do
as
you
please
mccomas
taking
her
hand
and
shaking
it
thank
you
clandon
will
nine
suit
you
clandon
perfectly
phil
will
you
ring
please
phil
rings
the
bell
but
if
i
am
to
be
accused
of
conspiring
with
valentine
i
think
he
had
better
be
present
valentine
rising
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
think
it
most
important
mccomas
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that
i
think
i
have
the
greatest
hopes
of
a
happy
settlement
for
the
present
he
goes
out
meeting
the
waiter
who
holds
the
door
for
him
to
pass
through
clandon
we
expect
some
visitors
at
nine
william
can
we
have
dinner
at
seven
instead
of
waiter
at
the
door
seven
certainly
it
will
be
a
convenience
to
us
this
busy
evening
there
will
be
the
band
and
the
arranging
of
the
fairy
lights
and
one
thing
or
another
dolly

fairy

oh
yes
sir

by
the
regatta
committee
for
the
benefit
of
the
sir
to
mrs
clandon
we
often
have
them
chinese
lanterns
in
the
garden
very
bright
and
pleasant
very
gay
and
innocent
indeed
to
phil
tickets
downstairs
at

dolly
breathlessly
seizing
his
other
arm
quick
before
they
all
sold
they
rush
him
out
of
the
room
between
them
clandon
what
on
earth
are
they
going
to
do
going
out
i
really
must
go
and
stop
this
she
follows
them
speaking
as
she
disappears
gloria
stares
coolly
at
valentine
and
then
deliberately
looks
at
her
watch
valentine
i
understand
i
stayed
too
long
i
going
gloria
with
disdainful
punctiliousness
i
owe
you
some
apology
valentine
i
am
conscious
of
having
spoken
somewhat
sharply
perhaps
rudely
to
you
valentine
not
at
all
gloria
my
only
excuse
is
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
consideration
and
respect
when
there
is
no
dignity
of
character
on
the
other
side
to
command
it
valentine
prosaically
how
is
a
man
to
look
dignified
when
infatuated
gloria
effectually
unstilted
do
say
those
things
to
me
i
forbid
you
they
are
insults
valentine
no
they
only
follies
i
ca
help
them
gloria
if
you
were
really
in
love
it
would
not
make
you
foolish
it
would
give
you
dignity
earnestness
even
beauty
valentine
do
you
really
think
it
would
make
me
beautiful
she
turns
her
back
on
him
with
the
coldest
contempt
ah
you
see
you
not
in
earnest
love
ca
give
any
man
new
gifts
it
can
only
heighten
the
gifts
he
was
born
with
gloria
sweeping
round
at
him
again
what
gifts
were
you
born
with
pray
valentine
lightness
of
heart
gloria
and
lightness
of
head
and
lightness
of
faith
and
lightness
of
everything
that
makes
a
man
valentine
yes
the
whole
world
is
like
a
feather
dancing
in
the
light
now
and
gloria
is
the
sun
she
rears
her
head
angrily
i
beg
your
pardon
i
off
back

waiter
enters
shewing
in
crampton
and
mccomas
crampton
looks
cowed
and
anxious
he
sits
down
wearily
and
timidly
on
the
ottoman
waiter
the
ladies
have
gone
for
a
turn
through
the
grounds
to
see
the
fancy
dresses
sir
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
take
seats
gentlemen
i
shall
tell
them
he
is
about
to
go
into
the
garden
through
the
window
when
mccomas
stops
him
mccomas
one
moment
if
another
gentleman
comes
shew
him
in
without
any
delay
we
are
expecting
him
waiter
right
sir
what
name
sir
mccomas
boon
mr
boon
he
is
a
stranger
to
clandon
so
he
may
give
you
a
card
if
so
the
name
is
spelt
you
will
not
forget
waiter
smiling
you
may
depend
on
me
for
that
sir
my
own
name
is
boon
sir
though
i
am
best
known
down
here
as
balmy
walters
sir
by
rights
i
should
spell
it
with
the
aitch
you
sir
but
i
think
it
best
not
to
take
that
liberty
sir
there
is
norman
blood
in
it
sir
and
norman
blood
is
not
a
recommendation
to
a
waiter
mccomas
well
well
true
hearts
are
more
than
coronets
and
simple
faith
than
norman
blood
waiter
that
depends
a
good
deal
on
one
station
in
life
sir
if
you
were
a
waiter
sir
you
find
that
simple
faith
would
leave
you
just
as
short
as
norman
blood
i
find
it
best
to
spell
myself
b
and
to
keep
my
wits
pretty
sharp
about
me
but
i
taking
up
your
time
sir
you
excuse
me
sir
your
own
fault
for
being
so
affable
sir
i
tell
the
ladies
you
here
sir
he
goes
out
into
the
garden
through
the
window
mccomas
crampton
i
can
depend
on
you
ca
i
crampton
yes
yes
i
be
quiet
i
be
patient
i
do
my
best
mccomas
remember
i
not
given
you
away
i
told
them
it
was
all
their
fault
crampton
you
told
me
that
it
was
all
my
fault
mccomas
i
told
you
the
truth
crampton
plaintively
if
they
will
only
be
fair
to
me
mccomas
my
dear
crampton
they
wo
be
fair
to
you
it
not
to
be
expected
from
them
at
their
age
if
you
going
to
make
impossible
conditions
of
this
kind
we
may
as
well
go
back
home
at
once
crampton
but
surely
i
have
a
right
mccomas
intolerantly
you
wo
get
your
rights
now
once
for
all
crampton
did
your
promises
of
good
behavior
only
mean
that
you
complain
if
there
nothing
to
complain
of
because
if
so
he
moves
as
if
to
go
crampton
miserably
no
no
let
me
alone
ca
you
i
been
bullied
enough
i
been
tormented
enough
i
tell
you
i
do
my
best
but
if
that
girl
begins
to
talk
to
me
like
that
and
to
look
at
me
like
he
breaks
off
and
buries
his
head
in
his
hands
mccomas
relenting
there
there
it
be
all
right
if
you
will
only
bear
and
forbear
come
pull
yourself
together
there
someone
coming
crampton
too
dejected
to
care
much
hardly
changes
his
attitude
gloria
enters
from
the
garden
mccomas
goes
to
meet
her
at
the
window
so
that
he
can
speak
to
her
without
being
heard
by
crampton
there
he
is
miss
clandon
be
kind
to
him
i
leave
you
with
him
for
a
moment
he
goes
into
the
garden
gloria
comes
in
and
strolls
coolly
down
the
middle
of
the
room
crampton
looking
round
in
alarm
where
mccomas
gloria
listlessly
but
not
unsympathetically
gone
out
to
leave
us
together
delicacy
on
his
part
i
suppose
she
stops
beside
him
and
looks
quaintly
down
at
him
well
father
crampton
a
quaint
jocosity
breaking
through
his
forlornness
well
daughter
they
look
at
one
another
for
a
moment
with
a
melancholy
sense
of
humor
gloria
shake
hands
they
shake
hands
crampton
holding
her
hand
my
dear
i
afraid
i
spoke
very
improperly
of
your
mother
this
afternoon
gloria
oh
do
apologize
i
was
very
high
and
mighty
myself
but
come
down
since
oh
yes
i
been
brought
down
she
sits
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
crampton
what
has
happened
to
you
my
child
gloria
oh
never
mind
i
was
playing
the
part
of
my
mother
daughter
then
but
i
not
i
my
father
daughter
looking
at
him
funnily
that
a
come
down
is
it
crampton
angry
what
her
odd
expression
does
not
alter
he
surrenders
well
yes
my
dear
i
suppose
it
is
i
suppose
it
is
she
nods
sympathetically
i
afraid
i
sometimes
a
little
irritable
but
i
know
what
right
and
reasonable
all
the
time
even
when
i
do
act
on
it
can
you
believe
that
gloria
believe
it
why
that
myself
myself
all
over
i
know
right
and
dignified
and
strong
and
noble
just
as
well
as
she
does
but
oh
the
things
i
do
the
things
i
do
the
things
i
let
other
people
do
crampton
a
little
grudgingly
in
spite
of
himself
as
well
as
she
does
you
mean
your
mother
gloria
quickly
yes
mother
she
turns
to
him
on
her
knees
and
seizes
his
hands
now
listen
no
treason
to
her
no
word
no
thought
against
her
she
is
our
superior
yours
and
mine
high
heavens
above
us
is
that
agreed
crampton
yes
yes
just
as
you
please
my
dear
gloria
not
satisfied
letting
go
his
hands
and
drawing
back
from
him
you
do
like
her
crampton
my
child
you
have
been
married
to
her
i
have
she
raises
herself
slowly
to
her
feet
looking
at
him
with
growing
coldness
she
did
me
a
great
wrong
in
marrying
me
without
really
caring
for
me
but
after
that
the
wrong
was
all
on
my
side
i
dare
say
he
offers
her
his
hand
again
gloria
taking
it
firmly
and
warningly
take
care
that
a
dangerous
subject
my
feelings
my
miserable
cowardly
womanly
feelings
may
be
on
your
side
but
my
conscience
is
on
hers
crampton
i
very
well
content
with
that
division
my
dear
thank
you
valentine
arrives
gloria
immediately
becomes
deliberately
haughty
valentine
excuse
me
but
it
impossible
to
find
a
servant
to
announce
one
even
the
never
failing
william
seems
to
be
at
the
ball
i
should
have
gone
myself
only
i
have
five
shillings
to
buy
a
ticket
how
are
you
getting
on
crampton
better
eh
crampton
i
am
myself
again
valentine
no
thanks
to
you
valentine
look
at
this
ungrateful
parent
of
yours
miss
clandon
i
saved
him
from
an
excruciating
pang
and
he
reviles
me
gloria
coldly
i
am
sorry
my
mother
is
not
here
to
receive
you
valentine
it
is
not
quite
nine
and
the
gentleman
of
whom
mccomas
spoke
the
lawyer
is
not
yet
come
valentine
oh
yes
he
is
i
met
him
and
talked
to
him
with
gay
malice
you
like
him
miss
clandon
he
the
very
incarnation
of
intellect
you
can
hear
his
mind
working
gloria
ignoring
the
jibe
where
is
he
valentine
bought
a
false
nose
and
gone
into
the
fancy
ball
crampton
crustily
looking
at
his
watch
it
seems
that
everybody
has
gone
to
this
fancy
ball
instead
of
keeping
to
our
appointment
here
valentine
oh
he
come
all
right
enough
that
was
half
an
hour
ago
i
did
like
to
borrow
five
shillings
from
him
and
go
in
with
him
so
i
joined
the
mob
and
looked
through
the
railings
until
miss
clandon
disappeared
into
the
hotel
through
the
window
gloria
so
it
has
come
to
this
that
you
follow
me
about
in
public
to
stare
at
me
valentine
yes
somebody
ought
to
chain
me
up
gloria
turns
her
back
on
him
and
goes
to
the
fireplace
he
takes
the
snub
very
philosophically
and
goes
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
the
waiter
appears
at
the
window
ushering
in
clandon
and
mccomas
clandon
hurrying
in
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
a
grotesquely
majestic
stranger
in
a
domino
and
false
nose
with
goggles
appears
at
the
window
waiter
to
the
stranger
beg
pardon
sir
but
this
is
a
private
apartment
sir
if
you
will
allow
me
sir
i
will
shew
you
to
the
american
bar
and
supper
rooms
sir
this
way
sir
he
goes
into
the
gardens
leading
the
way
under
the
impression
that
the
stranger
is
following
him
the
majestic
one
however
comes
straight
into
the
room
to
the
end
of
the
table
where
with
impressive
deliberation
he
takes
off
the
false
nose
and
then
the
domino
rolling
up
the
nose
into
the
domino
and
throwing
the
bundle
on
the
table
like
a
champion
throwing
down
his
glove
he
is
now
seen
to
be
a
stout
tall
man
between
forty
and
fifty
clean
shaven
with
a
midnight
oil
pallor
emphasized
by
stiff
black
hair
cropped
short
and
oiled
and
eyebrows
like
early
victorian
horsehair
upholstery
physically
and
spiritually
a
coarsened
man
in
cunning
and
logic
a
ruthlessly
sharpened
one
his
bearing
as
he
enters
is
sufficiently
imposing
and
disquieting
but
when
he
speaks
his
powerful
menacing
voice
impressively
articulated
speech
strong
inexorable
manner
and
a
terrifying
power
of
intensely
critical
listening
raise
the
impression
produced
by
him
to
absolute
tremendousness
the
stranger
my
name
is
bohun
general
awe
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
clandon
clandon
bows
bohun
bows
miss
clandon
gloria
bows
bohun
bows
clandon
crampton
insisting
on
his
rightful
name
as
angrily
as
he
dares
my
name
is
crampton
sir
bohun
oh
indeed
passing
him
over
without
further
notice
and
turning
to
valentine
are
you
clandon
valentine
making
it
a
point
of
honor
not
to
be
impressed
by
him
do
i
look
like
it
my
name
is
valentine
i
did
the
drugging
bohun
ah
quite
so
then
clandon
has
not
yet
arrived
waiter
entering
anxiously
through
the
window
beg
pardon
but
can
you
tell
me
what
became
of
that
he
recognizes
bohun
and
loses
all
his
bohun
waits
rigidly
for
him
to
pull
himself
together
after
a
pathetic
exhibition
of
confusion
he
recovers
himself
sufficiently
to
address
bohun
weakly
but
coherently
beg
pardon
sir
i
sure
sir
was
was
it
you
sir
bohun
ruthlessly
it
was
waiter
brokenly
yes
sir
unable
to
restrain
his
tears
you
in
a
false
nose
walter
he
sinks
faintly
into
a
chair
at
the
table
i
beg
pardon
i
sure
a
little
giddiness
bohun
commandingly
you
will
excuse
him
clandon
when
i
inform
you
that
he
is
my
father
waiter
heartbroken
oh
no
no
walter
a
waiter
for
your
father
on
the
top
of
a
false
nose
what
will
they
think
of
you
clandon
going
to
the
waiter
chair
in
her
kindest
manner
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
bohun
your
father
has
been
an
excellent
friend
to
us
since
we
came
here
bohun
bows
gravely
waiter
shaking
his
head
oh
no
it
very
kind
of
you
very
ladylike
and
affable
indeed
but
i
should
feel
at
a
great
disadvantage
off
my
own
proper
footing
never
mind
my
being
the
gentleman
father
it
is
only
the
accident
of
birth
after
all
he
gets
up
feebly
you
all
excuse
me
i
sure
having
interrupted
your
business
he
begins
to
make
his
way
along
the
table
supporting
himself
from
chair
to
chair
with
his
eye
on
the
door
bohun
one
moment
the
waiter
stops
with
a
sinking
heart
my
father
was
a
witness
of
what
passed
was
he
not
clandon
clandon
yes
most
of
it
i
think
bohun
in
that
case
we
shall
want
him
waiter
pleading
i
hope
it
may
not
be
necessary
sir
busy
evening
for
me
sir
with
that
ball
very
busy
evening
indeed
sir
bohun
inexorably
we
shall
want
you
clandon
politely
sit
down
wo
you
waiter
earnestly
oh
if
you
please
i
really
must
draw
the
line
at
sitting
down
i
could
let
myself
be
seen
doing
such
a
thing
thank
you
i
am
sure
all
the
same
he
looks
round
from
face
to
face
wretchedly
with
an
expression
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
gloria
do
let
us
waste
time
william
only
wants
to
go
on
taking
care
of
us
i
should
like
a
cup
of
coffee
waiter
brightening
perceptibly
coffee
miss
he
gives
a
little
gasp
of
hope
certainly
miss
thank
you
miss
very
timely
miss
very
thoughtful
and
considerate
indeed
to
clandon
timidly
but
expectantly
anything
for
you
clandon
er
oh
yes
it
so
hot
i
think
we
might
have
a
jug
of
claret
cup
waiter
beaming
claret
cup
certainly
gloria
oh
well
i
have
a
claret
cup
instead
of
coffee
put
some
cucumber
in
it
waiter
delighted
cucumber
miss
yes
miss
to
bohun
anything
special
for
you
sir
you
do
like
cucumber
sir
bohun
if
clandon
will
allow
me
syphon
scotch
waiter
right
sir
to
crampton
irish
for
you
sir
i
think
sir
crampton
assents
with
a
grunt
the
waiter
looks
enquiringly
at
valentine
valentine
i
like
the
cucumber
waiter
right
sir
summing
up
claret
cup
syphon
one
scotch
and
one
irish
clandon
i
think
that
right
waiter
perfectly
happy
right
directly
thank
you
he
ambles
off
through
the
window
having
sounded
the
whole
gamut
of
human
happiness
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
in
a
little
over
two
minutes
mccomas
we
can
begin
now
i
suppose
bohun
we
had
better
wait
until
clandon
husband
arrives
crampton
what
mean
i
her
husband
bohun
instantly
pouncing
on
the
inconsistency
between
this
and
his
previous
statement
you
said
just
now
your
name
was
crampton
crampton
so
it
is
clandon
all
four
i
gloria
speaking
my
mccomas
valentine
taneously
you
bohun
drowning
them
in
two
thunderous
words
one
moment
dead
silence
pray
allow
me
sit
down
everybody
they
obey
humbly
gloria
takes
the
chair
on
the
hearth
valentine
slips
around
to
her
side
of
the
room
and
sits
on
the
ottoman
facing
the
window
so
that
he
can
look
at
her
crampton
sits
on
the
ottoman
with
his
back
to
valentine
clandon
who
has
all
along
kept
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
in
order
to
avoid
crampton
as
much
as
possible
sits
near
the
door
with
mccomas
beside
her
on
her
left
bohun
places
himself
magisterially
in
the
centre
of
the
group
near
the
corner
of
the
table
on
clandon
side
when
they
are
settled
he
fixes
crampton
with
his
eye
and
begins
in
this
family
it
appears
the
husband
name
is
crampton
the
wife
clandon
thus
we
have
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
case
an
element
of
confusion
valentine
getting
up
and
speaking
across
to
him
with
one
knee
on
the
ottoman
but
it
perfectly
simple
bohun
annihilating
him
with
a
vocal
thunderbolt
it
is
clandon
has
adopted
another
name
that
is
the
obvious
explanation
which
you
feared
i
could
not
find
out
for
myself
you
mistrust
my
intelligence
valentine
stopping
him
as
he
is
about
to
protest
no
i
want
you
to
answer
that
i
want
you
to
think
over
it
when
you
feel
your
next
impulse
to
interrupt
me
valentine
dazed
this
is
simply
breaking
a
butterfly
on
a
wheel
what
does
it
matter
he
sits
down
again
bohun
i
will
tell
you
what
it
matters
sir
it
matters
that
if
this
family
difference
is
to
be
smoothed
over
as
we
all
hope
it
may
be
clandon
as
a
matter
of
social
convenience
and
decency
will
have
to
resume
her
husband
name
clandon
assumes
an
expression
of
the
most
determined
obstinacy
or
else
crampton
will
have
to
call
himself
clandon
crampton
looks
indomitably
resolved
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
no
doubt
you
think
that
an
easy
matter
valentine
he
looks
pointedly
at
clandon
then
at
crampton
i
differ
from
you
he
throws
himself
back
in
his
chair
frowning
heavily
mccomas
timidly
i
think
bohun
we
had
perhaps
better
dispose
of
the
important
questions
first
bohun
mccomas
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
the
important
questions
there
never
is
it
is
the
trifles
that
will
wreck
you
at
the
harbor
mouth
mccomas
looks
as
if
he
considered
this
a
paradox
you
do
agree
with
me
eh
mccomas
flatteringly
if
i
did
bohun
interrupting
him
if
you
did
you
would
be
me
instead
of
being
what
you
are
mccomas
fawning
on
him
of
course
bohun
your
specialty
bohun
again
interrupting
him
my
specialty
is
being
right
when
other
people
are
wrong
if
you
agreed
with
me
i
should
be
of
no
use
here
he
nods
at
him
to
drive
the
point
home
then
turns
suddenly
and
forcibly
on
crampton
now
you
crampton
what
point
in
this
business
have
you
most
at
heart
crampton
beginning
slowly
i
wish
to
put
all
considerations
of
self
aside
in
this
matter
bohun
interrupting
him
so
do
we
all
crampton
to
mrs
clandon
y
o
u
wish
to
put
self
aside
clandon
clandon
yes
i
am
not
consulting
my
own
feelings
in
being
here
bohun
so
do
you
miss
clandon
gloria
yes
bohun
i
thought
so
we
all
do
valentine
except
me
my
aims
are
selfish
bohun
that
because
you
think
an
impression
of
sincerity
will
produce
a
better
effect
on
miss
clandon
than
an
impression
of
disinterestedness
valentine
utterly
dismantled
and
destroyed
by
this
just
remark
takes
refuge
in
a
feeble
speechless
smile
bohun
satisfied
at
having
now
effectually
crushed
all
rebellion
throws
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
being
prepared
to
listen
tolerantly
to
their
grievances
now
crampton
go
on
it
understood
that
self
is
put
aside
human
nature
always
begins
by
saying
that
crampton
but
i
mean
it
sir
bohun
quite
so
now
for
your
point
crampton
every
reasonable
person
will
admit
that
it
an
unselfish
one
the
children
bohun
well
what
about
the
children
crampton
with
emotion
they
have
bohun
pouncing
forward
again
stop
you
going
to
tell
me
about
your
feelings
crampton
do
i
sympathize
with
them
but
they
not
my
business
tell
us
exactly
what
you
want
that
what
we
have
to
get
at
crampton
uneasily
it
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
bohun
bohun
come
i
help
you
out
what
do
you
object
to
in
the
present
circumstances
of
the
children
crampton
i
object
to
the
way
they
have
been
brought
up
bohun
how
do
you
propose
to
alter
that
now
crampton
i
think
they
ought
to
dress
more
quietly
valentine
nonsense
bohun
instantly
flinging
himself
back
in
his
chair
outraged
by
the
interruption
when
you
are
done
valentine
when
you
are
quite
done
valentine
what
wrong
with
miss
clandon
dress
crampton
hotly
to
valentine
my
opinion
is
as
good
as
yours
gloria
warningly
father
crampton
subsiding
piteously
i
did
mean
you
my
dear
pleading
earnestly
to
bohun
but
the
two
younger
ones
you
have
not
seen
them
bohun
and
indeed
i
think
you
would
agree
with
me
that
there
is
something
very
noticeable
something
almost
gay
and
frivolous
in
their
style
of
dressing
clandon
impatiently
do
you
suppose
i
choose
their
clothes
for
them
really
this
is
childish
crampton
furious
rising
childish
clandon
rises
indignantly
mccomas
all
crampton
you
promised
valentine
ing
and
ridiculous
they
dress
speaking
charmingly
gloria
together
pray
let
us
behave
reasonably
tumult
suddenly
they
hear
a
chime
of
glasses
in
the
room
behind
them
they
turn
in
silent
surprise
and
find
that
the
waiter
has
just
come
back
from
the
bar
in
the
garden
and
is
jingling
his
tray
warningly
as
he
comes
softly
to
the
table
with
it
waiter
to
crampton
setting
a
tumbler
apart
on
the
table
irish
for
you
sir
crampton
sits
down
a
little
shamefacedly
the
waiter
sets
another
tumbler
and
a
syphon
apart
saying
to
bohun
scotch
and
syphon
for
you
sir
bohun
waves
his
hand
impatiently
the
waiter
places
a
large
glass
jug
in
the
middle
and
claret
cup
all
subside
into
their
seats
peace
reigns
clandon
humbly
to
bohun
i
am
afraid
we
interrupted
you
bohun
bohun
calmly
you
did
to
the
waiter
who
is
going
out
just
wait
a
bit
waiter
yes
sir
certainly
sir
he
takes
his
stand
behind
chair
clandon
to
the
waiter
you
do
mind
our
detaining
you
i
hope
bohun
wishes
it
waiter
now
quite
at
his
ease
oh
no
not
at
all
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
watch
the
working
of
his
trained
and
powerful
mind
very
stimulating
very
entertaining
and
instructive
indeed
bohun
resuming
command
of
the
proceedings
now
crampton
we
are
waiting
for
you
do
you
give
up
your
objection
to
the
dressing
or
do
you
stick
to
it
crampton
pleading
bohun
consider
my
position
for
a
moment
i
have
got
myself
alone
to
consider
there
my
sister
sophronia
and
my
and
all
their
circle
they
have
a
great
horror
of
anything
that
is
at
all
at
all
well
bohun
out
with
it
fast
loud
gay
crampton
not
in
any
unprincipled
sense
of
course
but
but
blurting
it
out
desperately
those
two
children
would
shock
them
they
not
fit
to
mix
with
their
own
people
that
what
i
complain
of
clandon
with
suppressed
impatience
valentine
do
you
think
there
is
anything
fast
or
loud
about
phil
and
dolly
valentine
certainly
not
it
utter
bosh
nothing
can
be
in
better
taste
crampton
oh
yes
of
course
you
say
so
clandon
william
you
see
a
great
deal
of
good
english
society
are
my
children
overdressed
waiter
reassuringly
oh
dear
no
persuasively
oh
no
sir
not
at
all
a
little
pretty
and
tasty
no
doubt
but
very
choice
and
classy
very
genteel
and
high
toned
indeed
might
be
the
son
and
daughter
of
a
dean
sir
i
assure
you
sir
you
have
only
to
look
at
them
sir
to
at
this
moment
a
harlequin
and
columbine
dancing
to
the
music
of
the
band
in
the
garden
which
has
just
reached
the
coda
of
a
waltz
whirl
one
another
into
the
room
the
harlequin
dress
is
made
of
lozenges
an
inch
square
of
turquoise
blue
silk
and
gold
alternately
his
hat
is
gilt
and
his
mask
turned
up
the
petticoats
are
the
epitome
of
a
harvest
field
golden
orange
and
poppy
crimson
with
a
tiny
velvet
jacket
for
the
poppy
stamens
they
pass
an
exquisite
and
dazzling
apparition
between
mccomas
and
bohun
and
then
back
in
a
circle
to
the
end
of
the
table
where
as
the
final
chord
of
the
waltz
is
struck
they
make
a
tableau
in
the
middle
of
the
company
the
harlequin
down
on
his
left
knee
and
the
columbine
standing
on
his
right
knee
with
her
arms
curved
over
her
head
unlike
their
dancing
which
is
charmingly
graceful
their
attitudinizing
is
hardly
a
success
and
threatens
to
end
in
a
catastrophe
the
columbine
screaming
lift
me
down
somebody
i
going
to
fall
papa
lift
me
down
crampton
anxiously
running
to
her
and
taking
her
hands
my
child
dolly
jumping
down
with
his
help
thanks
so
nice
of
you
phil
putting
his
hat
into
his
belt
sits
on
the
side
of
the
table
and
pours
out
some
claret
cup
crampton
returns
to
his
place
on
the
ottoman
in
great
perplexity
oh

seats
herself
with
a
vault

dolly
i
well
finch
calls
me
by
my
christian
name
mccomas

naturally
as
an
old
friend
of
her
mother
dolly
yes
you
call
me
dolly
as
an
old
friend
of
my

your
temper
mccomas
do
let

quarrel

patient
mccomas
i
will

patient
you

monstrous
dolly
bohun
please

finch
for

bohun
i
will
mccomas
you

sit
down
mccomas
i
bohun
waving

mccomas
sits
down
sulkily
and
crampton
much
relieved
follows
his
example
dolly
to
bohun
meekly
thank
you
bohun
now
listen
to
me
all
of
you
i
give
no
opinion
mccomas
as
to
how
far
you
may
or
may
not
have
committed
yourself
in
the
direction
indicated
by
this
young
lady
mccomas
is
about
to
protest
no
interrupt
me
if
she
does
marry
you
she
will
marry
somebody
else
that
is
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
as
to
her
not
bearing
her
father
name
the
other
lady
intends
to
get
married
gloria
flushing
bohun
bohun
oh
yes
you
do
you

know
it
but
you

gloria
rising
stop
i
warn
you
bohun
not
to
answer
for
my
intentions
bohun
rising
it
no
use
miss
clandon
you
ca
put
me
down
i
tell
you
your
name
will
soon
be
neither
clandon
nor
crampton
and
i
could
tell
you
what
it
will
be
if
i
chose
he
goes
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
where
he
unrolls
his
domino
and
puts
the
false
nose
on
the
table
when
he
moves
they
all
rise
and
phil
goes
to
the
window
bohun
with
a
gesture
summons
the
waiter
to
help
him
in
robing
crampton
your
notion
of
going
to
law
is
all
nonsense
your
children
will
be
of
age
before
you
could
get
the
point
decided
allowing
the
waiter
to
put
the
domino
on
his
shoulders
you
can
do
nothing
but
make
a
friendly
arrangement
if
you
want
your
family
more
than
they
want
you
you
get
the
worse
of
the
arrangement
if
they
want
you
more
than
you
want
them
you
get
the
better
of
it
he
shakes
the
domino
into
becoming
folds
and
takes
up
the
false
nose
dolly
gazes
admiringly
at
him
the
strength
of
their
position
lies
in
their
being
very
agreeable
people
personally
the
strength
of
your
position
lies
in
your
income
he
claps
on
the
false
nose
and
is
again
grotesquely
transfigured
dolly
running
to
him
oh
now
you
look
quite
like
a
human
being
may
i
have
just
one
dance
with
you
c
a
n
you
dance
phil
resuming
his
part
of
harlequin
waves
his
hat
as
if
casting
a
spell
on
them
bohun
thunderously
yes
you
think
i
ca
but
i
can
come
along
he
seizes
her
and
dances
off
with
her
through
the
window
in
a
most
powerful
manner
but
with
studied
propriety
and
grace
the
waiter
is
meanwhile
busy
putting
the
chairs
back
in
their
customary
places
philip
on
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unconfined
william
waiter
yes

a
couple
of
dominos
and
false
noses

my
father
and
mccomas

what
harm

for
once
mccomas

mccomas
crampton
you
are
not
the
man
i
took
you
for
pointedly
bullies

always
cowards
he
goes
disgustedly
towards
the
window
crampton
following
him
well
never
mind
we
must
indulge
them
a
little
can
you
get
us
something
to
wear
waiter
waiter
certainly
sir
he
precedes
them
to
the
window
and
stands
aside
there
to
let
them
pass
out
before
him
this
way
sir
dominos
and
noses
sir
mccomas
angrily
on
his
way
out
i
shall
wear
my
own
nose
waiter
suavely
oh

yes
sir
the
false
one
will
fit
over
it
quite
easily
sir
plenty
of
room
sir
plenty
of
room
he
goes
out
after
mccomas
crampton
turning
at
the
window
to
phil
with
an
attempt
at
genial
fatherliness
come
along
my
boy
come
along
he
goes
philip
cheerily
following
him
coming
dad
coming
on
the
window
threshold
he
stops
looking
after
crampton
then
turns
fantastically
with
his
bat
bent
into
a
halo
round
his
head
and
says
with
a
lowered
voice
to
clandon
and
gloria
did
you
feel
the
pathos
of
that
he
vanishes
clandon
left
alone
with
gloria
why
did
valentine
go
away
so
suddenly
i
wonder
gloria
petulantly
i
do
know
yes
i
d
o
know
let
us
go
and
see
the
dancing
they
go
towards
the
window
and
are
met
by
valentine
who
comes
in
from
the
garden
walking
quickly
with
his
face
set
and
sulky
valentine
stiffly
excuse
me
i
thought
the
party
had
quite
broken
up
gloria
nagging
then
why
did
you
come
back
valentine
i
came
back
because
i
am
penniless
i
ca
get
out
that
way
without
a
five
shilling
ticket
clandon
has
anything
annoyed
you
valentine
gloria
never
mind
him
mother
this
is
a
fresh
insult
to
me
that
is
all
clandon
hardly
able
to
realize
that
gloria
is
deliberately
provoking
an
altercation
gloria
valentine
clandon
have
i
said
anything
insulting
have
i
done
anything
insulting
gloria
you
have
implied
that
my
past
has
been
like
yours
that
is
the
worst
of
insults
valentine
i
imply
nothing
of
the
sort
i
declare
that
my
past
has
been
blameless
in
comparison
with
yours
clandon
most
indignantly
valentine
valentine
well
what
am
i
to
think
when
i
learn
that
miss
clandon
has
made
exactly
the
same
speeches
to
other
men
that
she
has
made
to
me
when
i
hear
of
at
least
five
former
lovers
with
a
tame
naval
lieutenant
thrown
in
oh
it
too
bad
clandon
but
you
surely
do
not
believe
that
these
affairs
mere
jokes
of
the
children
were
serious
valentine
valentine
not
to
you
not
to
her
perhaps
but
i
know
what
the
men
felt
with
ludicrously
genuine
earnestness
have
you
ever
thought
of
the
wrecked
lives
the
marriages
contracted
in
the
recklessness
of
despair
the
suicides
the
the
the
gloria
interrupting
him
contemptuously
mother
this
man
is
a
sentimental
idiot
she
sweeps
away
to
the
fireplace
clandon
shocked
oh
my
d
e
a
r
e
s
t
gloria
valentine
will
think
that
rude
valentine
i
am
not
a
sentimental
idiot
i
am
cured
of
sentiment
for
ever
he
sits
down
in
dudgeon
clandon
valentine
you
must
excuse
us
all
women
have
to
unlearn
the
false
good
manners
of
their
slavery
before
they
acquire
the
genuine
good
manners
of
their
freedom
do
think
gloria
vulgar
gloria
turns
astonished
she
is
not
really
so
gloria
mother
you
apologize
for
me
to
h
i
m
clandon
my
dear
you
have
some
of
the
faults
of
youth
as
well
as
its
qualities
and
valentine
seems
rather
too
old
fashioned
in
his
ideas
about
his
own
sex
to
like
being
called
an
idiot
and
now
had
we
not
better
go
and
see
what
dolly
is
doing
she
goes
towards
the
window
valentine
rises
gloria
do
you
go
mother
i
wish
to
speak
to
valentine
alone
clandon
startled
into
a
remonstrance
my
dear
recollecting
herself
i
beg
your
pardon
gloria
certainly
if
you
wish
she
bows
to
valentine
and
goes
out
valentine
oh
if
your
mother
were
only
a
widow
she
worth
six
of
you
gloria
that
is
the
first
thing
i
have
heard
you
say
that
does
you
honor
valentine
stuff
come
say
what
you
want
to
say
and
let
me
go
gloria
i
have
only
this
to
say
you
dragged
me
down
to
your
level
for
a
moment
this
afternoon
do
you
think
if
that
had
ever
happened
before
that
i
should
not
have
been
on
my
guard
that
i
should
not
have
known
what
was
coming
and
known
my
own
miserable
weakness
valentine
scolding
at
her
passionately
do
talk
of
it
in
that
way
what
do
i
care
for
anything
in
you
but
your
weakness
as
you
call
it
you
thought
yourself
very
safe
did
you
behind
your
advanced
ideas
i
amused
myself
by
upsetting
t
h
e
m
pretty
easily
gloria
insolently
feeling
that
now
she
can
do
as
she
likes
with
him
indeed
valentine
but
why
did
i
do
it
because
i
was
being
tempted
to
awaken
your
heart
to
stir
the
depths
in
you
why
was
i
tempted
because
nature
was
in
deadly
earnest
with
me
when
i
was
in
jest
with
her
when
the
great
moment
came
who
was
awakened
who
was
stirred
in
whom
did
the
depths
break
up
in
myself
m
y
s
e
l
f
i
was
transported
you
were
only
offended
shocked
you
were
only
an
ordinary
young
lady
too
ordinary
to
allow
tame
lieutenants
to
go
as
far
as
i
went
that
all
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
conventional
apologies
he
makes
resolutely
for
the
door
gloria
stop
he
hesitates
oh
will
you
understand
if
i
tell
you
the
truth
that
i
am
not
making
an
advance
to
you
valentine
pooh
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
you
think
you
not
ordinary
that
i
was
right
that
you
really
have
those
depths
in
your
nature
it
flatters
you
to
believe
it
she
recoils
well
i
grant
that
you
are
not
ordinary
in
some
ways
you
are
a
clever
girl
gloria
stifles
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
takes
a
threatening
step
towards
him
but
you
not
been
awakened
yet
you
did
care
you
do
care
it
was
my
tragedy
not
yours
he
turns
to
the
door
she
watches
him
appalled
to
see
him
slipping
from
her
grasp
as
he
turns
the
handle
he
pauses
then
turns
again
to
her
offering
his
hand
let
us
part
kindly
gloria
enormously
relieved
and
immediately
turning
her
back
on
him
deliberately
i
trust
you
will
soon
recover
from
the
wound
valentine
brightening
up
as
it
flashes
on
him
that
he
is
master
of
the
situation
after
all
i
shall
recover
such
wounds
heal
more
than
they
harm
after
all
i
still
have
my
own
gloria
gloria
facing
him
quickly
what
do
you
mean
valentine
the
gloria
of
my
imagination
gloria
proudly
keep
your
own
gloria
the
gloria
of
your
imagination
her
emotion
begins
to
break
through
her
pride
the
real
gloria
the
gloria
who
was
shocked
offended
horrified
oh
yes
quite
truly
who
was
driven
almost
mad
with
shame
by
the
feeling
that
all
her
power
over
herself
had
been
broken
down
at
her
first
real
encounter
with
with
the
color
rushes
over
her
face
again
she
covers
it
with
her
left
hand
and
puts
her
right
on
his
left
arm
to
support
herself
valentine
take
care
i
losing
my
senses
again
summoning
all
her
courage
she
takes
away
her
hand
from
her
face
and
puts
it
on
his
right
shoulder
turning
him
towards
her
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
he
begins
to
protest
agitatedly
gloria
be
sensible
it
no
use
i
have
a
penny
in
the
world
gloria
ca
you
earn
one
other
people
do
valentine
half
delighted
half
frightened
i
never
could
be
unhappy
my
dearest
love
i
should
be
the
merest
adventurer
if
her
grip
on
his
arms
tightens
and
she
kisses
him
oh
lord
breathless
oh
i
he
gasps
i
do
know
anything
about
women
twelve
years
experience
is
not
enough
in
a
gust
of
jealousy
she
throws
him
away
from
her
and
he
reels
her
back
into
the
chair
like
a
leaf
before
the
wind
as
dolly
dances
in
waltzing
with
the
waiter
followed
by

us
have
no
false
delicacy
tell
my
mother
that
we
have
agreed
to
marry
one
another
a
silence
of
stupefaction
ensues

with
panic

at
them
with
an
obvious
impulse
to
run
away

the
silence

comes
between
gloria
and
valentine
valentine
the
point
is
bohun
mccomas
interrupting
from
the
hearthrug
excuse
me
sir
the
point
must
be
put
to
him
by
a
solicitor
the
question
is
one
of
an
engagement
between
these
two
young
people
the
lady
has
some
property
and
looking
at
crampton
will
probably
have
a
good
deal
more
crampton
possibly
i
hope
so
valentine
and
the
gentleman
has
a
rap
bohun
nailing
valentine
to
the
point
instantly
then
insist
on
a
settlement
that
shocks
your
delicacy
