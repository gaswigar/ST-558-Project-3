day

this
etext
was
produced
from
astounding
science
fiction
september
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this

was
renewed
natural
to

the
unproven
word
of
the
fellow
who
on
my
side
but
the
emotional
moron
is
on
no
one
side
not
even
his
own
once
such
an
emotional
moron
could
at
worst
hurt
a
few
but
with
the
mighty
leashed
forces
man
employs
now
there
were
still
in
a
few
people
who
were
afraid
of
the
nuclear
power
plant
oldsters
in
whom
the
term
atomic
energy
produced
semantic
reactions
associated
with
hiroshima
those
who
saw
in
the
towering
above
it
a
tempting
target
for
enemy
which
still
meant
soviet
bombers
and
guided
missiles
some
of
the
central
intelligence
and
people
who
realized
how
futile
even
the
most
elaborate
security
measures
were
against
a
resourceful
and
suicidally
determined
saboteur
and
a
minority
of
engineers
and
nuclear
physicists
who
remained
unpersuaded
that
accidental
blowups
at
plants
were
impossible
scott
melroy
was
among
these
last
he
knew
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
had
been
several
nasty
meticulously
unpublicized
at
the
long
island
nuclear
reaction
plant
all
involving
the
new
and
that
there
had
been
considerable
acrimony
before
the
melroy
engineering
corporation
had
been
given
the
contract
to
install
the
fully
cybernetic
control
system
intended
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
such
incidents
that
had
been
three
months
ago
melroy
and
his
people
had
moved
in
been
assigned
sections
of
a
couple
of
machine
shops
set
up
an
assembly
shop
and
a
set
of
offices
in
a
vacant
warehouse
just
outside
the
reactor
area
and
tried
to
start
work
only
to
run
into
the
almost
interminable
procedural
disputes
and
jurisdictional
wranglings
of
the
sort
which
he
privately
labeled
bureau
bunk
it
was
only
now
that
he
was
ready
to
begin
work
on
the
reactors
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
inner
of
three
successively
smaller
offices
on
the
second
floor
of
the
converted
warehouse
checking
over
a
analysis
of
a
relay
system
and
at
the
same
time
sharpening
a
pencil
his
knife
paring
off
tiny
feathery
shavings
of
wood
he
was
a
tall
man
of
indeterminate
age
with
thinning
sandy
hair
a
long
gaelic
upper
lip
and
a
wide
mouth
he
wore
an
shirt
and
an
old
and
shabby
leather
jacket
to
the
left
shoulder
of
which
a
few
clinging
flecks
of
paint
showed
where
some
military
emblem
had
been
long
ago
while
his
fingers
worked
with
the
jackknife
and
his
eyes
traveled
over
the
page
of
symbols
his
mind
was
reviewing
the
eight
different
ways
in
which
one
of
the
efficient
but
treacherous
reactors
could
be
allowed
to
reach
critical
mass
and
he
was
wondering
if
there
might
not
be
some
unsuspected
ninth
way
that
was
a
possibility
which
always
lurked
in
the
back
of
his
mind
and
lately
it
had
been
giving
him
surrealistic
nightmares
mr
melroy
the
box
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
said
suddenly
in
a
feminine
voice
melroy
rives
is
here
melroy
picked
up
the
handphone
thumbing
on
the
switch
dr
rives
he
repeated
the
psychologist
who
subbing
for
von
heydenreich
the
box
told
him
patiently
oh
yes
show
him
in
melroy
said
right
away
melroy
the
box
replied
replacing
the
handphone
melroy
wondered
for
a
moment
why
there
had
been
a
hint
of
suppressed
amusement
in
his
secretary
voice
then
the
door
opened
and
he
stopped
wondering
rives
was
a
him
she
was
a
her
very
attractive
looking
her
too
dark
hair
and
eyes
rather
features
clear
lightly
tanned
complexion
bright
red
lipstick
put
on
with
a
micrometric
exactitude
that
any
engineer
could
appreciate
she
was
tall
within
four
inches
of
his
own
mark
and
she
wore
a
black
tailored
outfit
perfectly
plain
which
had
probably
cost
around
five
hundred
dollars
and
would
have
looked
severe
and
mannish
except
that
the
figure
under
it
curved
and
bulged
in
just
the
right
places
and
to
just
the
right
degree
melroy
rose
laying
down
knife
and
pencil
and
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
good
afternoon
he
greeted
von
heydenreich
gave
me
quite
a
favorable
account
of
you
as
far
as
it
went
he
might
have
included
a
few
more
data
and
made
it
more
so
wo
you
sit
down
the
woman
laid
her
handbag
on
the
desk
and
took
the
visitor
chair
impish
mirth
sparking
in
her
eyes
he
probably
omitted
mentioning
that
the
is
for
doris
she
suggested
suppose
i
been
an
englishman
with
a
name
like
evelyn
or
vivian
melroy
tried
to
visualize
her
as
a
male
englishman
named
vivian
gave
up
and
grinned
at
her
let
this
be
a
lesson
he
said
inferences
are
to
be
drawn
from
objects
or
descriptions
of
objects
never
from
verbal
labels
do
you
initial
your
first
name
just
to
see
how
people
react
when
they
meet
you
well
no
though
that
an
amusing
and
sometimes
instructive
it
started
when
i
began
contributing
to
some
of
the
professional
journals
there
still
a
little
of
what
used
to
be
called
male
among
my
colleagues
and
some
who
would
be
favorably
impressed
with
an
article
signed
warren
rives
might
snort
in
contempt
at
the
same
article
signed
doris
rives
well
fortunately
von
heydenreich
is
one
of
those
melroy
said
how
is
the
herr
doktor
by
the
way
and
just
what
happened
to
him
miss
kourtakides
merely
told
me
that
he
been
injured
and
was
in
a
hospital
in
pittsburgh
the
herr
doktor
got
shot
doris
rives
informed
him
with
a
charge
of
bb
in
a
most
indelicate
portion
of
his
anatomy
he
was
out
hunting
the
last
day
of
season
and
somebody
mistook
him
for
a
turkey
nothing
really
serious
but
he
face
down
in
bed
cursing
hideously
in
german
english
russian
italian
and
french
mainly
because
he
missing
deer
hunting
i
might
have
known
it
melroy
said
in
disgust
the
ubiquitous
with
a
dangerous
mechanism
i
suppose
he
briefed
you
on
what
i
want
done
here
well
not
too
completely
i
gathered
that
you
want
me
to
give
intelligence
tests
or
aptitude
tests
or
something
of
the
sort
to
some
of
your
employees
i
not
really
one
of
these
industrial
anthropologists
she
explained
most
of
my
work
for
the
past
few
years
has
been
for
organizations
with
subnormal
persons
i
told
him
that
and
he
said
that
was
why
he
selected
me
he
said
one
other
thing
he
said
used
to
think
melroy
had
an
obsession
about
fools
well
after
stopping
this
load
of
shot
i
beginning
to
think
it
a
good
subject
to
be
obsessed
about
melroy
nodded
will
probably
do
would
be
more
exact
i
afraid
of
fools
and
the
chance
that
i
have
one
working
for
me
here
affects
me
like
having
a
cobra
crawling
around
my
bedroom
in
the
dark
i
want
you
to
locate
any
who
might
be
in
a
gang
of
new
men
i
had
to
hire
so
that
i
can
get
rid
of
them
and
just
how
do
you
define
the
term
mr
melroy
she
asked
remember
it
has
no
standard
meaning
republicans
apply
it
to
democrats
and
vice
versa
well
i
apply
it
to
people
who
do
things
without
considering
possible
consequences
people
who
pepper
distinguished
austrian
psychologists
in
the
with
for
a
starter
or
people
who
push
buttons
to
see
what
happen
or
turn
valves
and
twiddle
with
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
with
their
hands
or
shoot
insulators
off
power
lines
to
see
if
they
can
hit
them
people
who
do
know
it
loaded
people
who
think
warning
signs
are
purely
ornamental
people
who
play
practical
jokes
people
who
i
know
what
you
mean
just
i
saw
a
woman
toss
a
cocktail
into
an
electric
heater
she
did
want
to
drink
it
and
she
thought
it
would
just
go
up
in
steam
the
result
was
slightly
spectacular
next
time
she
wo
do
that
she
probably
throw
her
drink
into
a
if
there
one
around
well
on
a
statistical
basis
judge
that
i
have
three
or
four
such
dud
rounds
among
this
new
gang
hired
i
want
you
to
put
the
finger
on
them
so
i
can
bounce
them
before
they
blow
the
whole
plant
up
which
could
happen
quite
easily
that
doris
rives
said
is
not
going
to
be
as
easy
as
it
sounds
ordinary
wo
be
enough
the
woman
i
was
speaking
of
has
an
well
inside
the
meaning
of
normal
intelligence
she
just
does
use
it
sure
melroy
got
a
thick
folder
out
of
his
desk
and
handed
it
across
heydenreich
thought
of
that
too
he
got
this
up
for
me
about
five
years
ago
the
intelligence
test
is
based
on
the
new
french
sûreté
test
for
mentally
deficient
criminals
then
there
a
memory
test
and
tests
for
judgment
and
discrimination
semantic
reactions
temperamental
and
emotional
makeup
and
general
mental
attitude
she
took
the
folder
and
leafed
through
it
yes
i
see
i
always
liked
this
sûreté
test
and
this
memory
test
is
a
honey
hen
two
ducks
three
squawking
geese
four
corpulent
porpoises
five
limerick
oysters
six
pairs
of
don
alfonso
tweezers
i
like
to
see
some
of
these
boys
trying
to
make
visual
images
of
six
pairs
of
don
alfonso
tweezers
and
i
going
to
make
a
copy
of
this
list
it
really
a
semantic
reaction
test
korzybski
would
have
loved
it
and
of
course
our
old
friend
the
rorschach
i
always
harbored
the
impious
suspicion
that
you
can
prove
almost
anything
you
want
to
with
that
but
these
for
personal
interview
are
really
crafty
did
heydenreich
get
them
up
himself
yes
and
we
have
stacks
and
stacks
of
printed
forms
for
the
written
portion
of
the
test
and
big
cards
to
summarize
each
subject
on
and
we
have
a
to
use
in
the
oral
tests
there
have
to
be
a
pretty
complete
record
of
each
test
in
case
the
office
door
opened
and
a
bulky
man
with
a
black
mustache
entered
beating
the
snow
from
his
overcoat
with
a
battered
porkpie
hat
and
commenting
blasphemously
on
the
weather
he
advanced
into
the
room
until
he
saw
the
woman
in
the
chair
beside
the
desk
and
then
started
to
back
out
come
on
in
sid
melroy
told
him
rives
this
is
our
general
foreman
sid
keating
sid
rives
the
new
dimwit
detector
sid
in
direct
charge
of
personnel
he
continued
so
you
two
be
working
together
quite
a
bit
glad
to
know
you
doctor
keating
said
then
he
turned
to
melroy
scott
you
really
going
through
with
this
then
he
asked
afraid
we
have
trouble
then
look
sid
melroy
said
we
been
all
over
that
once
we
start
work
on
the
reactors
you
and
ned
puryear
and
joe
ricci
and
steve
chalmers
ca
be
everywhere
at
once
a
cybernetic
system
will
only
do
what
been
assembled
to
do
and
if
some
assembles
one
of
these
things
wrong
he
left
the
sentence
dangling
both
men
knew
what
he
meant
keating
shook
his
head
this
union
going
to
bawl
like
a
branded
calf
about
it
he
predicted
and
if
any
of
the
dear
sirs
and
brothers
get
washed
out
that
sentence
did
need
to
be
completed
either
we
have
a
right
melroy
said
to
discharge
any
worker
who
is
quote
of
unsound
mind
deficient
mentality
or
emotional
instability
unquote
it
says
so
right
in
our
union
contract
in
nice
big
print
then
they
claim
the
tests
are
wrong
i
ca
see
how
they
can
do
that
doris
rives
put
in
faintly
scandalized
neither
can
i
and
they
probably
wo
either
keating
told
her
but
they
go
ahead
and
do
it
why
scott
they
pulling
the
number
one
tonight
by
it
ought
to
be
cool
enough
to
work
on
where
will
we
hold
the
tests
here
we
have
to
unless
we
can
get
rives
melroy
turned
to
her
were
you
ever
by
any
government
agency
oh
yes
i
was
with
armed
forces
medical
psychiatric
division
in
indonesia
in
and
and
i
did
some
work
with
mental
fatigue
cases
at
tonto
basin
research
establishment
in
melroy
looked
at
her
sharply
keating
whistled
if
she
could
get
into
tonto
basin
she
can
get
in
here
he
declared
i
should
think
so
i
call
colonel
bradshaw
the
security
officer
that
way
we
can
test
them
right
on
the
job
keating
was
saying
take
them
in
relays
i
talk
to
ben
about
it
and
we
work
up
some
kind
of
a
schedule
he
turned
to
doris
rives
you
need
a
and
a
dosimeter
we
furnish
them
he
told
her
i
hope
they
try
to
make
you
carry
a
pistol
too
a
pistol
for
a
moment
she
must
have
thought
he
was
using
some
term
and
then
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
was
you
mean
she
cocked
her
thumb
and
crooked
her
index
finger
yeah
a
rod
roscoe
the
equalizer
we
all
have
to
he
one
out
of
his
side
pocket
we
all
united
states
deputy
marshals
they
do
bother
much
with
counterespionage
here
but
they
do
fool
when
it
comes
to
countersabotage
well
i
get
an
order
cut
and
posted
be
seeing
you
doctor
you
think
the
union
will
make
trouble
about
these
tests
she
asked
after
the
general
foreman
had
gone
out
they
sure
to
melroy
replied
here
the
situation
i
have
about
fifty
of
my
own
men
from
pittsburgh
here
but
they
ca
work
on
the
reactors
because
they
do
belong
to
the
industrial
federation
of
atomic
workers
and
i
ca
just
pay
their
initiation
fees
and
union
dues
and
get
union
cards
for
them
because
admission
to
this
union
is
on
an
annual
quota
basis
and
this
is
december
and
the
quota
full
so
i
have
to
use
them
outside
the
reactor
area
on
fabrication
and
assembly
work
and
i
have
to
hire
through
the
union
and
that
handled
on
a
membership
seniority
basis
so
i
have
to
take
what
thrown
at
me
that
why
i
was
careful
to
get
that
clause
i
was
quoting
to
sid
written
into
my
contract
now
here
what
going
to
happen
most
of
the
men
take
the
test
without
protest
but
a
few
of
them
raise
the
roof
about
it
nothing
burns
a
moron
worse
than
to
have
somebody
question
his
fractional
intelligence
the
odds
are
that
the
ones
that
yell
the
loudest
about
taking
the
test
will
be
the
ones
who
get
scrubbed
out
and
when
the
test
shows
that
they
deficient
they
wo
believe
it
a
moron
simply
can
not
conceive
of
his
being
anything
less
than
perfectly
intelligent
any
more
than
a
lunatic
can
conceive
of
his
being
less
than
perfectly
sane
so
they
claim
we
framing
them
for
an
excuse
to
fire
them
and
the
union
will
have
to
back
them
up
right
or
wrong
at
least
on
the
local
level
that
goes
without
saying
in
any
dispute
the
employer
is
always
wrong
and
the
worker
is
always
right
until
proven
otherwise
and
that
takes
a
lot
of
doing
believe
me
well
if
they
hired
through
the
union
on
a
seniority
basis
would
they
be
likely
to
be
experienced
and
competent
workers
she
asked
experienced
yes
that
is
none
of
them
has
ever
been
caught
doing
anything
downright
calamitous
yet
melroy
replied
the
moron
afraid
of
can
go
on
for
years
doing
routine
work
under
supervision
and
nothing
happen
then
some
day
he
does
something
on
his
own
initiative
and
when
he
does
it
only
at
the
whim
of
whatever
gods
there
be
that
the
result
is
a
wholesale
catastrophe
and
people
like
that
are
the
most
serious
threat
facing
our
civilization
today
atomic
war
not
excepted
doris
rives
lifted
a
delicately
penciled
eyebrow
over
that
melroy
pausing
to
relight
his
pipe
grinned
at
her
you
think
that
the
old
obsession
talking
he
asked
could
be
but
look
at
this
plant
here
it
generates
every
kilowatt
of
current
used
between
trenton
and
albany
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
included
except
for
a
few
little
or
diesel
generator
systems
that
could
handle
one
tenth
of
one
per
cent
of
the
barest
minimum
load
it
been
the
only
source
of
electric
current
here
since
when
the
last
power
plant
was
dismantled
knock
this
plant
out
and
you
darken
every
house
and
office
and
factory
and
street
in
the
area
you
immobilize
the
elevators
think
what
that
would
mean
in
lower
and
midtown
manhattan
alone
and
the
subways
and
the
new
conveyors
that
handle
eighty
per
cent
of
the
city
freight
traffic
and
the
railroads
there
are
a
dozen
steam
or
diesel
locomotives
left
in
the
whole
area
and
the
pump
stations
for
water
and
gas
and
fuel
oil
and
seventy
per

of
the
is
electric
now
why
you
ca
imagine
what
it
be
like
it
too
gigantic
but
what
you
can
imagine
would
be
a
nightmare
you
know
it
was
so
long
ago
when
every
home
lighted
and
heated
itself
and
every
little
industry
was
a
unit
that
a
fool
could
do
great
damage
unless
he
inherited
a
throne
or
was
placed
in
command
of
an
army
and
that
did
happen
nearly
as
often
as
our
leftist
social
historians
would
like
us
to
think
but
today
everything
we
depend
upon
is
centralized
and
vulnerable
to
even
our
food
remember
that
poisoned
horror
in
chicago
in
three
thousand
hospitalized
and
six
hundred
dead
because
of
one
stupid
mistake
at
a
bottling
plant
he
shook
himself
slightly
as
though
to
throw
off
some
shadow
that
had
fallen
over
him
and
looked
at
his
watch
sixteen
hundred
how
did
you
get
here
fly
your
own
plane
no
i
came
by
from
pittsburgh
i
have
a
room
at
the
new
midtown
city
hotel
on
street
i
had
my
luggage
sent
on
there
from
the
airport
and
came
out
on
the
long
island
subway
fine
i
have
a
room
at
midtown
city
myself
though
i
sleep
here
about
half
the
time
he
nodded
toward
a
door
on
the
left
suppose
we
go
in
and
have
dinner
together
this
cafeteria
here
is
a
horrible
place
it
run
by
a
dietitian
instead
of
a
chef
and
everything
so
antiseptic
that
i
swear
i
smell
ointment
every
time
i
go
in
the
place
wait
here
till
i
change
clothes
at
the
long
island
plant
no
one
was
concerned
about
espionage
neither
the
processes
nor
the
equipment
used
there
were
secret
but
the
countersabotage
security
was
fantastically
thorough
every
person
or
scrap
of
material
entering
the
reactor
area
was
searched
the
of
every
man
and
woman
employed
there
was
known
back
to
the
cradle
a
broad
highway
encircled
it
outside
the
fence
patrolled
night
and
day
by
twenty

stuart
there
were
a
thousand
soldiers
and
three
hundred

only
god
knew
how
many

central

every

nobody
outside

knew
how
much

protection
the

had

the

extended
from

as
far
inland
as

the

nuclear

melroy
thought
had
all
the
invulnerability
of
achilles
and
no
more
the
six
new
clustered
in
a
circle
inside
a
windowless
concrete
building
at
the
center
of
the

beside
their
primary
purpose
of
plutonium
production
they
furnished

for

finally
pumped

mains
of

safe
outside
the
shielding
in
a
corner
of
a
room
was
the
office
of
the
melroy
engineering
corporation
timekeepers
and
foremen
beyond
along
the
far
wall
were
the
washroom
and
locker
room
and
lunch
room
of
the
workmen
sixty
or
seventy
men
mostly
in
white
coveralls
and
all
wearing
identification
badges
and
carrying
dosimeters
in
their
breast
pockets
and
midget
geigers
strapped
to
their
wrists
were
crowded
about
the
in
front
of
the
makeshift
office
there
was
a
hum
of
voices
some
perplexed
or
angry
but
mostly
and
bantering
as
melroy
and
doris
rives
approached
the
talking
died
out
and
the
men
turned
in
the
sudden
silence
one
voice
harshly
strident
continued
do
they
think
this
is
anyhow
we
do
hafta
take
none
of
that
somebody
must
have
nudged
the
speaker
trying
without
success
to
hush
him
the
bellicose
voice
continued
and
melroy
spotted
the
speaker
short
his
arms
jutting
out
at
an
angle
from
his
body
his
heavy
features
soured
with
anger
like
we
was
a
lotta
halfwits
nuts
well
we
do
hafta
stand
for
this
they
ai
got
no
right
doris
rives
clung
tighter
to
melroy
arm
as
he
pushed
a
way
for
himself
and
her
through
the
crowd
and
into
the
temporary
office
inside
they
were
met
by
a
young
man
with
a
deputy
marshal
badge
on
his
flannel
shirt
and
a
revolver
on
his
hip
ben
puryear
rives
melroy
introduced
who
the
mouthy
character
outside
one
of
the
roustabouts
name
burris
puryear
replied
lawyer
melroy
nodded
you
always
get
one
or
two
like
that
how
the
rest
taking
it
puryear
shrugged
about
how
you
expect
a
lot
of
kidding
about
got
any
intelligence
to
test
burris
seems
to
be
the
only
one
trying
to
make
an
issue
out
of
it
well
what
are
they
doing
ganged
up
here
melroy
wanted
to
know
past
why
are
they
at
work
reactor
still
too
hot
temperature
and
radioactivity
both
too
high
radioactivity
still
up
around
eight
hundred
rem
well
then
we
give
them
all
the
written
portion
of
the
test
together
and
start
the
personal
interviews
and
oral
tests
as
soon
as
they
through
he
turned
to
doris
rives
can
you
give
all
of
them
the
written
test
together
he
asked
and
can
ben
help
you
distributing
forms
timing
the
test
seeing
that
there
no
fudging
and
collecting
the
forms
when
they
done
oh
yes
all
they
have
to
do
is
follow
the
printed
instructions
she
looked
around
i
need
a
desk
and
an
extra
chair
for
the
interview
subject
right
over
here
doctor
puryear
said
and
here
are
the
forms
and
cards
and
the
and
blank
sound
disks
yes
melroy
added
be
sure
you
get
a
recording
of
every
interview
and
oral
test
we
may
need
them
for
evidence
he
broke
off
as
a
man
in
white
coveralls
came
pushing
into
the
office
he
was
a
scrawny
little
fellow
with
a
wide
mouth
and
a
protuberant
adam
apple
beside
his
identity
badge
he
wore
a
celluloid
button
lettered
steward
wanta
use
the
phone
he
said
union
business
melroy
gestured
toward
a
telephone
on
the
desk
beside
him
the
newcomer
shook
his
head
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
smirk
not
that
one
the
one
with
the
whisper
mouthpiece
he
said
this
is
private
union
business
melroy
shrugged
and
indicated
another
phone
the
man
with
the
union
steward
badge
picked
it
up
dialed
and
held
a
lengthy
conversation
into
it
turning
his
head
away
in
case
melroy
might
happen
to
be
a
lip
reader
finally
he
turned
crandall
wants
to
talk
to
you
he
said
grinning
triumphantly
the
phone
extended
to
melroy
the
engineer
picked
up
another
phone
snapping
a
button
on
the
base
of
it
melroy
here
he
said
something
on
the
line
started
going
softly
crandall
executive
secretary
the
man
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
identified
himself
is
there
a
recorder
going
on
this
line
naturally
melroy
replied
i
record
all
business
conversations
office
routine
melroy
i
been
informed
that
you
propose
forcing
our
members
in
your
employ
to
submit
to
some
kind
of
a
mental
test
is
that
correct
not
exactly
i
not
able
to
force
anybody
to
submit
to
anything
against
his
will
if
anybody
objects
to
taking
these
tests
he
can
say
so
and
i
have
his
time
made
out
and
pay
him
off
that
the
same
thing
a
threat
of
dismissal
is
coercion
and
if
these
men
want
to
keep
their
jobs
they
have
to
take
this
test
well
that
stated
more
or
less
correctly
melroy
conceded
just
put
it
that
taking
and
passing
this
test
is
a
condition
of
employment
my
contract
with
your
union
recognizes
my
right
to
establish
standards
of
intelligence
that
implied
by
my
recognized
right
to
dismiss
any
person
of
mind
deficient
mentality
or
emotional
instability
psychological
testing
is
the
only
means
of
determining
whether
or
not
a
person
is
classifiable
in
those
terms
then
in
case
the
test
purports
to
show
that
one
of
these
men
is
say
mentally
deficient
you
intend
dismissing
him
with
the
customary
two
weeks
yes
well
if
you
do
dismiss
anybody
on
those
grounds
the
union
will
have
to
insist
on
reviewing
the
grounds
for
dismissal
my
contract
with
your
union
says
nothing
whatever
about
any
right
of
review
being
reserved
by
the
union
in
such
cases
only
in
cases
of
disciplinary
dismissal
which
this
is
not
i
take
the
position
that
certain
minimum
standards
of
intelligence
and
mental
stability
are
essentials
in
this
sort
of
work
just
as
say
certain
minimum
standards
of
literacy
are
essential
in
clerical
work
then
you
going
to
make
these
men
take
these
tests
whatever
they
are
if
they
want
to
work
for
me
yes
and
anybody
who
fails
to
pass
them
will
be
dropped
from
my
payroll
and
who
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
these
men
have
successfully
passed
these
tests
crandall
asked
you
good
lord
no
i
an
electronics
engineer
not
a
psychologist
the
tests
are
being
given
and
will
be
evaluated
by
a
graduate
psychologist
warren
rives
who
has
a
diploma
from
the
american
board
of
psychiatry
and
neurology
and
is
a
member
of
the
american
psychological
association
rives
will
be
the
final
arbiter
on
who
is
or
is
not
disqualified
by
these
tests
well
our
man
koffler
says
you
have
some
girl
there
to
give
the
tests
crandall
accused
i
suppose
he
means
rives
melroy
replied
i
can
assure
you
she
is
an
extremely
competent
psychologist
however
she
came
to
me
most
highly
recommended
by
karl
von
heydenreich
who
is
not
inclined
to
be
careless
with
his
recommendations
well
melroy
we
do
want
any
more
trouble
with
you
than
we
have
to
have
crandall
told
him
but
we
will
insist
on
reviewing
any
dismissals
which
occur
as
a
result
of
these
tests
you
can
do
that
i
advise
first
that
you
read
over
the
contract
you
signed
with
me
get
a
qualified
lawyer
to
tell
you
what
we
agreed
to
and
what
we
have
was
there
anything
else
you
wanted
to
talk
about
no
then
good
morning
mr
crandall
he
hung
up
all
right
let
get
on
with
it
he
said
ben
you
get
them
into
the
lunch
room
there
are
enough
tables
and
benches
in
there
for
everybody
to
take
the
written
test
in
two
relays
the
union
got
ta
be
represented
while
these
tests
is
going
on
the
union
steward
announced
crandall
says
i
to
stay
here
an
watch
what
you
do
to
these
guys
this
man
working
for
us
melroy
asked
puryear
yes
koffler
julius
electrical
fitter
joe
ricci
gang
all
right
see
to
it
that
he
gets
placed
in
the
first
relay
for
the
written
test
and
gets
first
turn
for
the
orals
that
way
he
can
spend
the
rest
of
his
time
on
duty
here
for
the
union
and
will
know
in
advance
what
the
test
is
like
he
turned
to
koffler
but
understand
this
you
keep
your
mouth
out
of
it
if
you
see
anything
that
looks
objectionable
make
a
note
of
it
but
do
try
to
interfere
the
written
tests
done
on
printed
forms
required
about
twenty
minutes
melroy
watched
the
process
of
oral
testing
and
personal
interviewing
for
a
while
then
picked
up
a
big
flashlight
and
dropped
it
into
his
overcoat
pocket
preparatory
to
going
out
to
inspect
some
equipment
that
had
been
assembled
outside
the
reactor
area
and
brought
in
as
he
went
out
koffler
was
straddling
a
chair
glowering
at
doris
rives
and
making
occasional
ostentatious
notes
on
a
pad
for
about
an
hour
he
poked
around
the
newly
assembled
apparatus
checking
the
wiring
and
peering
into
it
when
he
returned
to
the
temporary
office
the
oral
testing
was
still
going
on
koffler
was
still
on
duty
as
watcher
for
the
union
but
the
sport
had
evidently
palled
on
him
for
he
was
now
studying
a
comic
book
melroy
left
the
reactor
area
and
returned
to
the
office
in
the
converted
area
during
the
midafternoon
somebody
named
leighton
called
him
from
the
atomic
power
authority
executive
office
wanting
to
know
what
was
the
trouble
between
him
and
the
and
saying
that
a
protest
against
his
alleged
and
arbitrary
conduct
had
been
received
from
the
union
melroy
explained
at
length
he
finished
you
people
have
twenty
stuart
tanks
and
a
couple
of
thousand
soldiers
and
cops
and
here
guarding
against
sabotage
do
you
realize
that
a
workman
who
makes
stupid
or
careless
or
impulsive
mistakes
is
just
as
dangerous
to
the
plant
as
any
saboteur
if
somebody
shoots
you
through
the
head
it
does
matter
whether
he
planned
to
murder
you
for
a
year
or
just
did
know
the
gun
was
loaded
you
as
dead
one
way
as
the
other
i
should
think
you
thank
me
for
trying
to
eliminate
a
serious
source
of
danger
now
do
misunderstand
my
position
melroy
the
other
man
hastened
to
say
i
sympathize
with
your
attitude
entirely
but
these
people
are
going
to
make
trouble
if
they
do
it
be
my
trouble
i
under
contract
to
install
this
cybernetic
system
for
you
you
are
responsible
for
my
labor
policy
melroy
replied
oh
have
you
had
much
to
do
with
this
man
crandall
yourself
have
i
had
leighton
sputtered
for
a
moment
i
in
charge
of
personnel
here
that
makes
me
his
target
all
the
time
well
what
sort
of
a
character
is
he
anyhow
when
i
contracted
with
the
my
lawyer
and
their
lawyer
handled
everything
i
never
even
met
him
well
he
has
his
job
to
do
the
same
as
i
have
leighton
said
he
does
it
conscientiously
but
it
like
this
anything
a
workman
tells
him
is
the
truth
and
anything
an
employer
tells
him
is
a
dirty
lie
until
proven
differently
of
course
but
that
takes
a
lot
of
doing
and
he
goes
off
a
lot
of
times
he
does
stop
to
analyze
situations
very
closely
that
what
i
was
afraid
of
well
you
tell
him
you
do
have
any
control
over
my
labor
relations
tell
him
to
bring
his
gripes
to
me
at
doris
rives
came
in
finding
him
still
at
his
desk
i
have
the
written
tests
all
finished
and
i
have
about
twenty
of
the
tests
and
interviews
completed
she
said
i
have
to
evaluate
the
results
though
i
wonder
if
there
a
vacant
desk
around
here
anywhere
and
a
record
player
yes
sure
ask
joan
to
fix
you
up
she
find
a
place
for
you
to
work
and
if
you
going
to
be
working
late
i
order
some
dinner
for
you
from
the
cafeteria
i
going
to
be
here
all
evening
myself
sid
keating
came
in
a
short
while
later
peeling
out
of
his
overcoat
jacket
and
shoulder
holster
i
do
think
they
got
everything
out
of
that
reactor
he
said
radioactivity
still
almost
about
eight
hundred
rem
and
the
temperature
away
up
too
that
is
lingering
radiation
that
prompt
radiation
radioactivity
has
dropped
since
morning
i
think
so
too
melroy
said
what
are
they
getting
on
the
breakdown
counter
mostly
neutrons
and
i
talked
to
fred
hausinger
the
maintenance
boss
he
does
like
it
either
well
i
no
nuclear
physicist
melroy
disclaimed
but
all
that
alpha
stuff
looks
like
a
big
chunk
of
left
inside
what
fred
doing
about
it
oh
poking
around
inside
the
reactor
with
telemetered
scanners
and
equipment
when
i
left
he
had
a
gang
pulling
out
graphite
blocks
with
we
probably
wo
get
a
chance
to
work
on
it
much
before
tomorrow
he
unzipped
a
bulky
brief
case
he
had
brought
in
under
his
arm
and
dumped
papers
onto
his
desk
i
still
have
this
stuff
to
get
straightened
out
too
had
anything
to
eat
then
call
the
cafeteria
and
have
them
send
up
three
dinners
rives
is
eating
here
too
find
out
what
she
wants
i
want
pork
chops
abner
melroy
chops
unless
otherwise
specified
keating
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
middle
office
as
he
opened
the
door
melroy
could
hear
a
recording
of
somebody
being
given
a
test
half
an
hour
later
when
the
food
arrived
they
spread
their
table
on
a
relatively
clear
desk
in
the
middle
office
doris
rives
had
finished
evaluating
the
completed
tests
after
dinner
she
intended
going
over
the
written
portions
of
the
uncompleted
tests
how
the
finished
tests
come
out
melroy
asked
her
better
than
i
expected
only
two
washouts
she
replied
harvey
burris
and
julius
koffler
oh
keating
wailed
the
steward
and
the
boy
on
the
job
well
was
that
to
be
expected
melroy
asked
if
you
seen
the
act
those
two
put
on
they
both
inherently
stupid
infantile
and
deficient
in
reasoning
ability
and
judgment
doris
said
koffler
is
a
typical
adolescent
type
and
burris
is
an
almost
perfect
schoolyard
bully
they
both
have
inferiority
complexes
long
enough
to
step
on
if
the
purpose
of
this
test
is
what
i
led
to
believe
it
is
i
ca
in
professional
good
conscience
recommend
anything
but
that
you
get
rid
of
both
of
them
what
bob
getting
at
is
that
they
the
very
ones
who
can
claim
with
the
best
show
of
plausibility
that
the
test
is
just
a
pretext
to
fire
them
for
union
activities
melroy
explained
and
the
worst
of
it
is
they
the
only
ones
maybe
we
can
scrub
out
a
couple
more
on
the
written
tests
alone
then
they
have
company
keating
suggested
no
i
ca
do
that
doris
was
firm
on
the
point
the
written
part
of
the
test
was
solely
for
ability
to
reason
logically
just
among
the
three
of
us
i
know
some
university
professors
who
flunk
on
that
but
if
the
rest
of
the
tests
show
stability
sense
of
responsibility
good
judgment
and
a
tendency
to
think
before
acting
the
subject
can
be
classified
as
a
safe
and
reliable
workman
well
then
let
do
say
anything
till
we
have
the
tests
all
finished
keating
proposed
no
melroy
cried
every
minute
those
two
are
on
the
job
there
a
chance
they
may
do
something
disastrous
i
fire
them
at
tomorrow
all
right
keating
shook
his
head
i
only
work
here
but
do
say
i
did
warn
you
by
the
next
morning
keating
forebodings
began
to
be
realized
the
first
intimation
came
with
a
phone
call
to
melroy
from
crandall
who
accused
him
of
having
used
the
psychological
tests
as
a
fraudulent
pretext
for
discharging
koffler
and
burris
for
union
activities
when
melroy
rejected
his
demand
that
the
two
men
be
reinstated
crandall
demanded
to
see
the
records
of
the
tests
they
here
at
my
office
melroy
told
him
you
welcome
to
look
at
them
and
hear
recordings
of
the
oral
portions
of
the
tests
but
advise
you
to
bring
a
professional
psychologist
along
because
unless
you
a
trained
psychologist
yourself
they
not
likely
to
mean
much
to
you
oh
sure
crandall
retorted
they
have
to
be
unintelligible
to
ordinary
people
or
you
could
get
away
with
this
well
do
worry
i
be
along
to
see
them
within
ten
minutes
the
phone
rang
again
this
time
it
was
leighton
the
atomic
power
authority
man
we
much
disturbed
about
this
dispute
between
your
company
and
the
he
began
well
frankly
so
am
i
melroy
admitted
i
here
to
do
a
job
not
play
hatfields
and
mccoys
with
this
union
i
had
union
trouble
before
and
it
is
fun
you
the
gentleman
who
called
me
last
evening
are
you
then
you
understand
my
position
in
the
matter
certainly
melroy
i
was
talking
to
colonel
bradshaw
the
security
officer
last
evening
he
agrees
that
a
stupid
or
careless
workman
is
under
some
circumstances
a
more
serious
threat
to
security
than
any
saboteur
and
we
realize
fully
how
dangerous
those
are
and
how
much
more
dangerous
they
be
if
these
cybernetic
controls
were
improperly
assembled
but
this
man
crandall
is
talking
about
calling
a
strike
well
let
him
in
the
first
place
it
be
against
me
not
against
the
atomic
power
authority
and
in
the
second
place
if
he
does
and
it
goes
to
federal
mediation
his
demand
for
the
reinstatement
of
those
men
will
be
thrown
out
and
his
own
organization
will
have
to
disavow
his
action
because
he
be
calling
the
strike
against
his
own
contract
well
i
hope
so
leighton
tone
indicated
that
the
hope
was
rather
dim
i
wish
you
luck
you
going
to
need
it
within
the
hour
crandall
arrived
at
melroy
office
he
was
a
young
man
he
gave
melroy
the
impression
of
having
recently
seen
military
service
probably
in
the
indonesian
campaign
of
and
he
also
seemed
a
little
cocky
and
of
himself
melroy
we
not
going
to
stand
for
this
he
began
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
room
you
using
these
tests
as
a
pretext
for
getting
rid
of
koffler
and
burris
because
of
their
legitimate
union
activities
who
gave
you
that
idea
melroy
wanted
to
know
koffler
and
burris
that
the
complaint
they
made
to
me
and
it
borne
out
by
the
facts
crandall
replied
we
have
on
record
at
least
half
a
dozen
complaints
that
koffler
has
made
to
us
about
different
unfair
improper
working
conditions
inequities
in
allotting
overtime
work
and
other
infractions
of
conditions
on
behalf
of
burris
so
you
decided
to
get
rid
of
both
of
them
and
you
think
you
can
use
this
clause
in
our
contract
with
your
company
about
persons
of
deficient
intelligence
the
fact
is
you
known
to
have
threatened
on
several
occasions
to
get
rid
of
both
of
them
i
am
melroy
looked
at
crandall
curiously
wondering
if
the
latter
were
serious
and
deciding
that
he
was
you
must
believe
those
people
tell
you
well
they
lied
to
you
if
they
told
you
that
naturally
that
what
you
say
crandall
replied
but
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
those
two
men
and
only
those
two
men
were
dismissed
for
alleged
deficient
intelligence
the
tests
are
all
made
melroy
replied
until
they
are
you
say
that
they
are
the
only
ones
disqualified
and
if
you
look
over
the
records
of
the
tests
you
see
where
koffler
and
burris
failed
and
the
others
passed
here
he
laid
the
pile
of
forms
and
the
summary
and
evaluation
sheets
on
the
desk
here
koffler
and
burris
these
are
the
ones
of
the
men
who
passed
the
test
look
them
over
if
you
want
to
crandall
examined
the
forms
and
summaries
for
the
two
men
who
had
been
discharged
and
compared
them
with
several
random
samples
from
the
satisfactory
pile
why
this
stuff
a
lot
of
gibberish
he
exclaimed
indignantly
this
thing
here
five
limerick
oysters
six
pairs
of
don
alfonso
tweezers
seven
hundred
macedonian
warriors
in
full
battle
array
eight
golden
crowns
from
the
ancient
secret
crypts
of
egypt
nine
lymphatic
sympathetic
peripatetic
old
men
on
crutches
and
ten
revolving
heliotropes
from
the
institute
great
lord
do
you
actually
mean
that
you
using
this
stuff
as
an
excuse
for
depriving
men
of
their
jobs
i
warned
you
that
you
should
have
brought
a
professional
psychologist
along
melroy
reminded
him
and
maybe
you
ought
to
get
koffler
and
burris
to
repeat
their
complaints
on
a
while
you
at
it
they
took
the
same
tests
in
the
same
manner
as
any
of
the
others
they
just
did
have
the
mental
equipment
to
cope
with
them
and
the
others
did
and
for
that
reason
i
wo
run
the
risk
of
having
them
working
on
this
job
that
just
your
word
against
theirs
crandall
insisted
obstinately
their
complaint
is
that
you
framed
this
whole
thing
up
to
get
rid
of
them
why
i
did
even
know
who
either
of
them
were
until
yesterday
morning
that
not
the
way
they
tell
it
crandall
retorted
they
say
you
and
keating
have
been
out
to
get
them
ever
since
they
were
hired
you
and
your
supervisors
have
been
persecuting
both
of
those
men
systematically
the
fact
that
burris
has
had
grounds
for
all
these
previous
complaints
proves
that
it
proves
that
burris
has
a
persecution
complex
and
that
credulous
enough
to
believe
him
melroy
replied
and
that
tends
to
confirm
the
results
of
the
tests
they
failed
to
pass
oh
so
that
the
line
you
taking
you
persecute
a
man
and
then
say
he
has
a
persecution
complex
if
he
recognizes
the
fact
well
you
not
going
to
get
away
with
it
that
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
crandall
flung
the
he
had
been
holding
on
to
the
desk
that
not
worth
the
paper
it
scribbled
on
he
turned
on
his
heel
in
an
automatically
correct
and
strode
out
of
the
office
melroy
straightened
out
the
papers
and
put
them
away
then
sat
down
at
his
desk
filling
and
lighting
his
pipe
he
was
still
working
at
when
ben
puryear
called
him
they
walked
out
on
us
he
reported
harry
crandall
was
out
here
talking
to
them
and
at
noon
the
whole
gang
handed
in
their
and
dosimeters
and
cleared
out
their
lockers
they
say
they
are
coming
back
till
burris
and
koffler
come
back
to
work
with
them
then
they
are
coming
back
period
melroy
replied
crandall
was
to
see
me
a
couple
of
hours
ago
he
tells
me
that
burris
and
koffler
told
him
that
we
been
persecuting
burris
discriminating
against
him
you
know
of
anything
that
really
happened
that
might
make
them
think
anything
like
that
no
burris
is
always
yelling
about
not
getting
enough
overtime
work
but
you
know
how
it
is
he
just
a
roustabout
a
common
laborer
any
overtime
work
that
has
to
be
done
is
usually
skilled
labor
on
this
job
we
generally
have
a
few
roustabouts
to
help
out
but
he
been
allowed
to
make
overtime
as
much
as
any
of
the
others
will
the
show
that
they
ought
to
i
do
know
what
he
and
koffler
told
crandall
but
whatever
it
was
i
bet
they
were
lying
that
all
right
then
how
the
reactor
now
hausinger
says
the
count
down
to
safe
limits
and
the
down
to
inactive
normal
he
and
his
gang
found
a
big
chunk
of
plutonium
about
cm
inside
he
got
it
out
all
right
tell
rives
to
gather
up
all
her
completed
or
partially
completed
test
records
and
come
out
to
the
office
you
and
the
others
stay
on
the
job
we
may
have
some
men
for
you
by
this
afternoon
tomorrow
morning
certainly
he
hung
up
then
picked
up
the
communicator
phone
and
called
his
secretary
joan
is
sid
keating
out
there
send
him
in
will
you
keating
when
he
entered
was
wearing
the
lugubriously
gratified
expression
appropriate
to
the
successful
prophet
of
disaster
all
right
cassandra
melroy
greeted
him
i
not
going
to
say
you
did
warn
me
look
this
strike
is
illegal
it
a
violation
of
the
federal
labor
act
of
being
called
without
due
notice
of
intention
without
preliminary
negotiation
and
without
two
weeks
they
going
to
claim
that
it
is
a
strike
they
going
to
call
it
a
aah
i
hope
i
can
get
crandall
on
record
to
that
effect
i
fire
every
one
of
those
men
for
leaving
their
work
without
permission
and
absence
from
duty
without
leave
how
many
of
our
own
men
from
pittsburgh
do
we
have
working
in
these
machine
shops
and
in
the
assembly
shop
here
about
sixty
why
you
not
going
to
use
them
to
work
on
the
reactor
are
you
i
just
am
they
all
qualified
cybernetics
technicians
they
can
do
this
work
better
than
this
gang
we
had
to
hire
here
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
promoting
all
of
them
as
of
this
morning
to
assistant
on
salaries
that
take
them
outside
union
jurisdiction
but
how
about
our
contract
with
the
that
been
voided
by
crandall
own
act
in
interfering
with
the
execution
of
our
contract
with
the
atomic
power
authority
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
the
front
office
is
going
to
have
to
disavow
this
it
hurt
them
to
do
it
but
they
have
to
crandall
put
them
in
the
middle
on
this
how
about
security
clearance
for
our
own
men
nothing
to
that
melroy
said
most
of
them
are
already
from
the
work
we
did
installing
that
control
system
on
the
and
the
work
we
did
on
that
computer
for
the
philadelphia
project
it
may
take
all
day
to
get
the
red
tape
unwound
but
i
think
we
can
be
ready
to
start
by
tomorrow
by
the
time
keating
had
rounded
up
all
the
regular
melroy
engineering
corporation
employees
and
melroy
had
talked
to
colonel
bradshaw
about
it
was
a
little
later
he
was
called
on
the
phone
by
leighton
the
atomic
power
authority
man
melroy
what
are
you
trying
to
do
the
power
authority
man
demanded
get
this
whole
plant
struck
shut
the
madder
than
a
bobcat
they
claim
you
going
to
bring
in
they
talking
about
picketing
the
whole
reactor
area
news
gets
around
fast
here
does
it
melroy
commented
he
told
leighton
what
he
had
in
mind
the
power
authority
man
was
considerably
shaken
before
he
had
finished
but
they
call
a
strike
on
the
whole
plant
have
you
any
idea
what
that
would
mean
certainly
i
have
they
either
call
it
in
legal
form
in
which
case
the
whole
thing
will
go
to
mediation
and
get
aired
which
is
what
i
want
or
they
pull
a
pearl
harbor
on
you
the
way
they
did
on
me
and
in
that
case
the
president
will
have
to
intervene
and
they
fly
in
technicians
from
some
of
the
armed
forces
plants
to
keep
this
place
running
and
in
that
case
things
get
settled
that
much
quicker
this
crandall
thinks
these
men
i
fired
are
martyrs
and
he
preaching
a
crusade
he
ought
to
carry
an
on
his
payroll
to
scrutinize
the
qualifications
of
his
martyrs
before
he
starts
canonizing
them
a
little
later
doris
rives
came
into
the
office
her
hands
full
of
papers
and
cards
i
have
twelve
more
tests
completed
she
reported
only
one
washout
melroy
laughed
doctor
they
all
washed
out
he
told
her
it
seems
there
was
an
additional
test
and
they
all
flunked
it
evinced
willingness
to
follow
unwise
leadership
and
allow
themselves
to
be
talked
into
improper
courses
of
action
you
go
on
in
to
new
york
and
take
all
the
including
sound
records
with
you
stay
at
the
hotel
your
pay
will
go
on
till
i
need
you
there
be
a
federal
mediation
hearing
in
a
day
or
so
he
had
two
more
telephone
calls
the
first
at
was
from
leighton
melroy
suspected
that
the
latter
had
been
medicating
his
morale
with
a
couple
of
stiff
drinks
his
voice
was
almost
jaunty
well
the
war
on
he
announced
the
walking
out
on
the
whole
plant
at
tomorrow
in
violation
of
the
federal
labor
act
section
eight
paragraphs
four
and
five
melroy
supplemented
crandall
really
has
stuck
his
neck
in
the
guillotine
what
washington
doing
president
hartley
is
ordering
navy
personnel
flown
in
from
kennebunkport
reaction
lab
they
will
be
here
by
about
tomorrow
and
a
couple
of
federal
mediators
are
coming
in
to
la
guardia
at
seventeen
hundred
they
going
to
hold
preliminary
hearings
at
the
new
federal
building
on
washington
square
beginning
twenty
hundred
a
couple
of
negotiators
are
coming
in
from
the
national
union
headquarters
at
oak
ridge
they
should
be
getting
in
about
the
same
time
you
better
be
on
hand
and
have
rives
there
with
you
there
a
good
chance
this
thing
may
get
cleared
up
in
a
day
or
so
i
will
undoubtedly
be
there
complete
with
rives
melroy
replied
it
will
be
a
pleasure
an
hour
later
ben
puryear
called
from
the
reactor
area
his
voice
strained
with
anger
scott
do
you
know
what
those
he
gargled
obscenities
for
a
moment
you
know
what
they
done
they
the
number
one
got
a
started
again
who
fred
hausinger
gang
apparently
at
harry
crandall
orders
the
excuse
was
that
it
would
be
unsafe
to
leave
the
reactor
in
its
dismantled
condition
during
a
prolonged
shutdown
they
were
assuming
i
suppose
that
the
strike
would
be
allowed
to
proceed
unopposed
but
of
course
the
real
reason
was
that
they
wanted
to
get
a
started
to
keep
our
people
from
working
on
the
reactor
well
did
hausinger
try
to
stop
them
not
very
hard
i
asked
him
what
he
had
that
deputy
marshal
badge
on
his
shirt
and
that
luger
on
his
hip
for
but
he
said
he
had
orders
not
to
use
force
for
fear
of
prejudicing
the
mediators
melroy
swore
disgustedly
all
right
gather
up
all
our
private
papers
and
get
steve
and
joe
and
come
on
out
we
only
work
here
when
able
doris
rives
was
waiting
on
the
street
level
when
melroy
reached
the
new
federal
building
in
what
had
formerly
been
the
greenwich
village
district
of
manhattan
that
evening
she
had
a
heavy
brief
case
with
her
which
he
took
i
was
afraid
i
keep
you
waiting
she
said
i
came
down
from
the
hotel
by
cab
and
there
was
a
frightful
jam
at
fortieth
street
and
another
one
just
below
madison
square
yes
it
gets
worse
every
year
pardon
my
obsession
but
nine
times
out
of
ten
out
of
a
hundred
it
the
fault
of
some
fool
doing
something
stupid
speaking
about
doing
stupid
things
though
i
did
one
forgot
to
take
that
gun
out
of
my
overcoat
pocket
and
did
notice
that
i
had
it
till
i
was
on
the
subway
coming
in
have
a
big
flashlight
in
the
other
pocket
but
that
does
matter
what
i
worried
about
is
that
somebody
find
out
i
have
a
gun
and
raise
a
howl
about
my
coming
armed
to
a
mediation
hearing
the
hearing
was
to
be
held
in
one
of
the
big
conference
rooms
on
the
floor
melroy
was
careful
to
remove
his
overcoat
and
lay
it
on
a
table
in
the
corner
and
then
help
doris
off
with
hers
and
lay
it
on
top
of
his
own
there
were
three
men
in
the
room
when
they
arrived
kenneth
leighton
the
atomic
power
authority
man
fiftyish
acquiring
a
waistline
bulge
and
losing
his
hair
a
lyons
tall
and
slender
with
white
hair
and
a
quillen
considerably
younger
with
glasses
the
latter
two
were
the
federal
mediators
all
three
had
been
lounging
in
talking
about
the
new
plays
on
broadway
they
all
rose
when
melroy
and
doris
rives
came
over
to
join
them
we
must
discuss
business
until
the
others
get
here
leighton
warned
it
bad
enough
that
all
three
of
us
got
here
ahead
of
them
they
be
sure
to
think
we
trying
to
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
them
i
suppose
neither
of
you
have
had
time
to
see
any
of
the
new
plays
fortunately
doris
and
melroy
had
gone
to
the
theater
after
dinner
the
they
were
able
to
join
the
conversation
young
quillen
wanted
doris
rives
opinion
as
a
psychologist
of
the
mental
processes
of
the
heroine
of
the
play
they
had
seen
as
nearly
as
she
could
determine
doris
replied
the
heroine
in
question
had
exhibited
nothing
even
loosely
describable
as
mental
processes
of
any
sort
they
were
still
on
the
subject
when
the
two
labor
negotiators
cronnin
and
fields
arrived
cronnin
was
in
his
sixties
with
the
nearsighted
squint
and
compressed
look
of
concentration
of
an
precision
machinist
fields
was
much
younger
and
sported
a
phi
beta
kappa
key
lyons
who
seemed
to
be
the
senior
mediator
thereupon
called
the
meeting
to
order
and
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
now
gentlemen
and
rives
this
will
be
simply
an
informal
discussion
so
that
everybody
can
see
what
everybody
else
position
in
the
matter
is
we
wo
bother
to
make
a
sound
recording
then
if
we
have
managed
to
reach
some
common
understanding
of
the
question
this
evening
we
can
start
the
regular
hearing
say
at
thirteen
hundred
tomorrow
is
that
agreeable
it
was
the
younger
mediator
quillen
cleared
his
throat
it
seems
from
our
information
that
this
entire
dispute
arises
from
the
discharge
by
melroy
of
two
of
his
employees
named
koffler
and
burris
is
that
correct
well
there
also
the
question
of
the
melroy
engineering
attempting
to
use
and
the
long
island
atomic
power
authority
having
condoned
this
unfair
employment
practice
cronnin
said
acidly
and
there
also
the
question
of
the
calling
a
pearl
harbor
strike
on
my
company
melroy
added
we
resent
that
characterization
cronnin
retorted
it
a
term
in
common
usage
it
denotes
a
strike
called
without
warning
or
declaration
of
intention
which
this
was
melroy
told
him
and
there
also
the
question
of
the
calling
a
general
strike
in
illegal
manner
at
the
long
island
reaction
plant
leighton
spoke
up
on
sixteen
hours
notice
well
that
was
the
fault
of
the
as
an
organization
fields
argued
cronnin
and
i
are
agreed
that
the
date
should
be
postponed
for
two
weeks
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
labor
act
well
how
about
my
company
melroy
wanted
to
know
your
members
walked
out
on
me
without
any
notice
whatever
at
twelve
hundred
today
am
i
to
consider
that
an
act
of
your
union
or
will
you
disavow
it
so
that
i
can
fire
all
of
them
for
quitting
without
permission
and
how
about
the
action
of
members
of
your
union
acting
on
instructions
from
harry
crandall
in
the
number
one
at
our
plant
after
the
plutonium
and
the
and
the
containers
had
been
removed
in
order
to
a
chain
reaction
to
prevent
melroy
employees
from
working
on
the
reactor
leighton
demanded
am
i
to
understand
that
the
union
sustains
that
action
too
i
had
known
about
that
fields
said
somewhat
startled
neither
had
i
cronnin
added
when
did
it
happen
about
sixteen
hundred
today
melroy
told
him
we
were
on
the
plane
from
oak
ridge
then
fields
declared
we
know
nothing
about
that
well
are
you
going
to
take
the
responsibility
for
it
or
are
you
leighton
insisted
lyons
who
had
been
toying
with
a
small
metal
paperweight
rapped
on
the
table
with
it
gentlemen
he
interrupted
we
trying
to
cover
too
many
subjects
at
once
i
suggest
that
we
confine
ourselves
at
the
beginning
to
the
question
of
the
dismissal
of
these
men
burris
and
koffler
if
we
find
that
the
has
a
legitimate
grievance
in
what
we
may
call
the
question
we
can
settle
that
and
then
go
on
to
these
other
questions
i
agreeable
to
that
melroy
said
so
are
we
cronnin
nodded
all
right
then
since
the
is
the
complaining
party
in
this
question
perhaps
you
gentlemen
should
state
the
grounds
for
your
complaints
fields
and
cronnin
exchanged
glances
cronnin
nodded
to
fields
and
the
latter
rose
the
two
employees
in
question
he
stated
had
been
the
victims
of
discrimination
and
persecution
because
of
union
activities
koffler
was
the
union
for
the
men
employed
by
the
melroy
engineering
corporation
and
burris
had
been
active
in
bringing
complaints
about
unfair
employment
practices
furthermore
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
that
the
psychological
tests
imposed
on
their
members
had
been
a
fraudulent
pretext
for
dismissing
these
two
men
and
in
any
case
the
practice
of
compelling
workers
to
submit
to
such
tests
was
insulting
degrading
and
not
a
customary
condition
of
employment
with
that
he
sat
down
melroy
was
on
his
feet
at
once
i
deny
those
statements
categorically
and
seriatim
he
replied
they
are
based
entirely
upon
misrepresentations
made
by
the
two
men
who
were
disqualified
by
the
tests
and
dropped
from
my
payroll
because
of
being
in
the
words
of
my
contract
with
your
union
of
unsound
mind
deficient
intelligence
emotional
instability
what
happened
is
that
your
local
official
crandall
accepted
everything
they
told
him
uncritically
and
you
accepted
everything
crandall
told
you
in
the
same
spirit
before
i
go
on
melroy
continued
turning
to
lyons
have
i
your
permission
to
let
rives
explain
about
these
tests
herself
and
tell
how
they
were
given
and
evaluated
permission
granted
by
lyons
doris
rives
rose
at
some
length
she
explained
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
tests
and
her
method
of
scoring
and
correlating
them
well
did
melroy
suggest
to
you
that
any
specific
employee
or
employees
of
his
were
undesirable
and
ought
to
be
eliminated
fields
asked
certainly
not
doris
rives
became
angry
and
if
he
had
i
have
taken
the
first
plane
out
of
here
that
suggestion
is
insulting
and
for
your
information
i
never
met
melroy
before
afternoon
i
am
not
dependent
upon
him
for
anything
i
took
this
job
as
an
accommodation
to
karl
von
heydenreich
who
ordinarily
does
such
work
for
the
melroy
company
and
i
losing
money
by
remaining
here
does
that
satisfy
you
yes
it
does
fields
admitted
he
was
obviously
impressed
by
mention
of
the
distinguished
austrian
psychologist
name
if
i
may
ask
melroy
a
question
i
gather
that
these
tests
are
given
to
all
your
employees
why
do
you
demand
such
an
extraordinary
level
of
intelligence
from
your
employees
even
common
laborers
extraordinary
melroy
echoed
if
the
standards
established
by
those
tests
are
extraordinary
then
god
help
this
country
we
are
becoming
a
race
of
morons
i
leave
that
statement
to
rives
for
confirmation
she
already
pointed
out
that
all
that
is
required
to
pass
those
tests
is
ordinary
adult
mental
capacity
my
company
specializes
in
systems
he
continued
in
spite
of
a
lot
of
misleading
colloquial
jargon
about
machines
and
brains
a
cybernetic
system
does
really
think
it
only
does
what
it
been
designed
to
do
and
if
somebody
builds
a
mistake
into
it
it
will
automatically
and
infallibly
repeat
that
mistake
in
practice
he
right
cronnin
said
the
men
that
build
a
machine
like
that
have
got
to
be
as
smart
as
the
machine
supposed
to
be
or
the
machine
be
as
dumb
as
they
are
fields
turned
on
him
angrily
which
side
are
you
supposed
to
be
on
anyhow
he
demanded
you
probably
a
lawyer
melroy
said
but
i
bet
cronnin
an
old
man
cronnin
nodded
unthinkingly
in
confirmation
all
right
then
ask
him
what
those
are
like
and
then
let
me
ask
you
suppose
some
moron
fixed
up
something
that
would
go
wrong
or
made
the
wrong
kind
of
a
mistake
himself
around
one
of
those
reactors
it
was
purely
a
rhetorical
question
but
much
later
when
he
would
have
time
to
think
about
it
scott
melroy
was
to
wonder
if
ever
in
history
such
a
question
had
been
answered
so
promptly
and
with
such
dramatic
calamitousness
three
seconds
after
he
stopped
speaking
the
lights
went
out
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
and
motionless
then
somebody
across
the
table
from
melroy
began
to
say
what
the
devil
doris
rives
beside
him
clutched
his
arm
at
the
head
of
the
table
lyons
was
fuming
impatiently
and
kenneth
leighton
snapped
a
and
held
it
up
the
windows
across
the
room
faced
east
in
the
flicker
of
the
lighter
melroy
made
his
way
around
to
them
and
drew
open
the
slats
of
one
looking
out
except
for
the
headlights
of
cars
far
down
in
the
street
and
the
lights
of
ships
in
the
harbor
the
city
was
completely
blacked
out
but
there
was
one
other
horrible
light
far
away
at
the
distant
tip
of
long
island
a
huge
ball
of
flame
floating
upward
at
the
tip
of
a
column
of
fiery
gas
as
he
watched
there
were
twinkles
of
unbearable
brightness
at
the
base
of
the
pillar
of
fire
spreading
into
awesome
and
other
fireballs
soared
up
then
the
sound
and
the
of
the
first
blast
reached
them
the
main
too
melroy
said
to
himself
not
realizing
that
he
spoke
audibly
too
well
shielded
for
the
blast
to
get
them
but
the
heat
melted
the
fissionables
down
to
critical
mass
leighton
the
lighter
still
burning
was
beside
him
now
that
not
god
it
ca
be
anything
else
why
the
whole
gone
there
are
enough
other
generators
in
this
area
to
handle
a
hundredth
of
the
demand
and
do
blame
that
on
my
alleged
melroy
warned
they
had
got
to
enter
the
reactor
area
when
this
happened
what
do
you
think
happened
cronnin
asked
one
of
the
let
go
yes
your
man
crandall
if
he
survived
that
it
his
bad
luck
melroy
said
grimly
last
night
while
fred
hausinger
was
pulling
the
fissionables
and
radioactives
out
of
the
number
one
breeder
he
found
a
big
nugget
of
about
cm
i
do
know
what
was
done
with
it
but
i
do
know
that
crandall
had
the
maintenance
gang
repack
that
reactor
to
keep
my
people
from
working
on
it
nobody
ever
find
out
just
what
happened
but
they
were
in
a
hurry
they
probably
shoved
things
in
any
old
way
somehow
that
big
subcritical
nugget
must
have
got
back
in
and
the
which
were
pretty
ripe
by
that
time
must
have
been
shoved
in
too
close
to
it
and
to
one
another
you
know
how
fast
those
work
it
just
took
this
long
to
build
up
cm
for
a
reaction
you
remember
what
i
was
saying
before
the
lights
went
out
well
it
happened
some
moron
some
untested
and
undetected
moron
made
the
wrong
kind
of
a
mistake
too
bad
about
crandall
he
was
a
good
kid
only
he
did
stop
to
think
often
enough
cronnin
said
well
i
guess
the
strike
off
now
that
one
thing
but
all
those
people
out
there
womanlike
doris
rives
was
thinking
particularly
rather
than
generally
and
of
humans
rather
than
abstractions
it
must
have
killed
everybody
for
miles
around
sid
keating
melroy
thought
and
joe
ricci
and
ben
puryear
and
steve
chalmers
and
all
the
workmen
whom
he
had
brought
here
from
pittsburgh
to
their
death
then
he
stopped
thinking
about
them
it
did
do
any
good
to
think
of
men
who
been
killed
he
learned
that
years
ago
as
a
kid
second
lieutenant
in
korea
the
people
to
think
about
were
the
millions
in
greater
new
york
and
up
the
hudson
valley
to
albany
and
as
far
south
as
trenton
caught
without
light
in
the
darkness
without
heat
in
the
dead
of
winter
without
power
in
subways
and
skyscrapers
and
on
railroads
and
interurban
lines
he
turned
to
the
woman
beside
him
doris
before
you
could
get
your
board
of
psychiatry
and
neurology
diploma
you
had
to
qualify
as
a
regular
did
you
he
asked
why
yes
then
you
better
report
to
the
nearest
hospital
any
doctor
at
all
is
going
to
be
desperately
needed
for
the
next
day
or
so
me
i
still
have
a
reserve
major
commission
in
the
army
corps
of
engineers
probably
calling
up
reserve
officers
with
any
radios
that
are
still
working
until
i
hear
differently
i
ordering
myself
on
active
duty
as
of
now
he
looked
around
anybody
know
where
the
nearest
army
headquarters
is
there
a
recruiting
station
down
on
the
floor
quillen
said
it
probably
closed
now
though
ground
defense
command
midtown
city
leighton
said
they
have
a
medical
section
of
their
own
they
be
glad
to
get
rives
too
melroy
helped
her
on
with
her
coat
and
handed
her
her
handbag
then
shrugged
into
his
own
overcoat
and
belted
it
about
him
the
weight
of
the
flashlight
and
the
automatic
sagging
the
pockets
he
need
both
the
gun
as
much
as
the
light
new
york
had
more
than
its
share
of
vicious
criminals
to
whom
this
would
be
a
perfect
devilsend
handing
doris
the
light
he
let
her
take
his
left
arm
together
they
left
the
room
and
went
down
the
hallway
to
the
stairs
and
the
long
walk
to
the
darkened
