to
the
english
protestant
some
apology
is
perhaps
needed
when
a
protestant
thus
brings
before
protestant
readers
the
works
of
a
consistent
roman
catholic
author
the
plea
must
be
that
the
doctrine
and
experience
described
are
essentially
protestant
and
so
far
from
their
receiving
the
assent
of
the
roman
catholic
church
their
author
was
persecuted
for
holding
and
disseminating
them
of
the
experience
of
madame
guyon
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
though
the
glorious
heights
of
communion
with
god
to
which
she
attained
may
be
scaled
by
the
feeblest
of
god
chosen
ones
yet
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
they
should
be
reached
by
the
same
apparently
arduous
and
protracted
path
along
which
she
was
led
the
torrents
especially
needs
to
be
regarded
rather
as
an
account
of
the
personal
experience
of
the
author
than
as
the
plan
which
god
invariably
or
even
usually
adopts
in
bringing
the
soul
into
a
state
of
union
with
himself
it
is
true
that
in
order
that
we
may
live
unto
righteousness
we
must
be
dead
indeed
unto
sin
and
that
there
must
be
a
crucifixion
of
self
before
the
life
of
christ
can
be
made
manifest
in
us
it
is
only
when
we
can
say
i
am
crucified
with
christ
that
we
are
able
to
add
nevertheless
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
but
it
does
not
follow
that
this
inward
death
must
always
be
as
lingering
as
in
the
case
of
madame
guyon
she
tells
us
herself
that
the
reason
was
that
she
was
not
wholly
resigned
to
the
divine
will
and
willing
to
be
deprived
of
the
gifts
of
god
that
she
might
enjoy
the
possession
of
the
giver
this
resistance
to
the
will
of
god
implies
suffering
on
the
part
of
the
creature
and
chastisement
on
the
part
of
god
in
order
that
he
may
subdue
to
himself
what
is
not
voluntarily
yielded
to
him
of
the
joy
of
a
complete
surrender
to
god
it
is
not
necessary
to
speak
here
thousands
of
god
children
are
realising
its
blessedness
for
themselves
and
proving
that
it
is
no
hardship
but
a
joy
unspeakable
to
present
themselves
a
living
sacrifice
to
god
to
live
no
longer
to
themselves
but
to
him
that
died
for
them
and
rose
again
a
simple
trust
in
a
living
personal
saviour
a
putting
away
by
his
grace
of
all
that
is
known
to
be
in
opposition
to
his
will
and
an
entire
to
him
that
his
designs
may
be
worked
out
in

gen
xvii
i
did
not
write
this
little
work
with
the
thought
of
its
being
given
to
the
public
it
was
prepared
for
the
help
of
a
few
christians
who
were
desirous
of
loving
god
with
the
whole
heart
but
so
many
have
requested
copies
of
it
because
of
the
benefit
they
have
derived
from
its
perusal
that
i
have
been
asked
to
publish
it
i
have
left
it
in
its
natural
simplicity
i
do
not
condemn
the
opinions
of
any
on
the
contrary
i
esteem
those
which
are
held
by
others
and
submit
all
that
i
have
written
to
the
censure
of
persons
of
experience
and
learning
i
only
ask
of
all
that
they
will
not
be
content
with
examining
the
outside
but
that
they
will
penetrate
the
design
of
the
writer
which
is
only
to
lead
others
to
love
god
and
to
serve
him
with
greater
happiness
and
success
by
enabling
them
to
do
it
in
a
simple
and
easy
way
fit
for
the
little
ones
who
are
not
capable
of
extraordinary
things
but
who
truly
desire
to
themselves
to
i
ask
all
who
may
read
it
to
read
without
prejudice
and
they
will
discover
under
common
expressions
a
hidden
unction
which
will
lead
them
to
seek
for
a
happiness
which
all
ought
to
expect
to
possess
i
use
the
word
saying
that
perfection
is
easy
because
it
is
easy
to
find
god
we
seek
him
within
the
passage
may
be
quoted
which
says
ye
shall
seek
me
and
shall
not
find
me
john
vii
yet
this
need
not
occasion
any
difficulty
because
the
same
god
who
can
not
contradict
himself
has
said
he
that
seeketh
findeth
matt
vii
who
seeks
god
and
who
yet
is
unwilling
to
forsake
sin
will
not
find
him
because
he
is
seeking
him
where
he
can
not
be
therefore
it
is
added
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins
he
who
sincerely
desires
to
forsake
sin
that
he
may
draw
near
to
god
will
find
him
many
people
imagine
religion
so
frightful
and
prayer
so
extraordinary
that
they
are
not
willing
to
strive
after
them
never
expecting
to
attain
to
them
but
as
the
difficulty
which
we
see
in
a
thing
causes
us
to
despair
of
succeeding
in
it
and
at
the
same
time
removes
the
desire
to
undertake
it
and
as
when
a
thing
appears
both
desirable
and
easy
to
be
attained
we
give
ourselves
to
it
with
pleasure
and
pursue
it
boldly
i
have
been
constrained
to
set
forth
the
advantage
and
the
of
this
way
oh
if
we
were
persuaded
of
the
goodness
of
god
toward
his
poor
creatures
and
of
the
desire
which
he
has
to
communicate
himself
to
them
we
should
not
imagine
so
many
obstacles
and
despair
so
easily
of
obtaining
a
good
which
he
is
so
infinitely
desirous
of
imparting
to
us
and
if
he
has
not
spared
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all
is
there
anything
he
can
refuse
us
assuredly
not
we
only
need
a
little
courage
and
perseverance
we
have
so
much
of
both
for
trifling
temporal
interests
and
we
have
none
for
the
thing
as
for
those
who
find
a
difficulty
in
believing
that
it
is
easy
to
find
god
in
this
way
let
them
not
believe
all
that
they
are
told
but
rather
let
them
make
trial
of
it
that
they
may
judge
for
themselves
and
they
will
find
that
i
say
very
little
in
comparison
with
that
which
is
dear
reader
study
this
little
work
with
a
simple
and
sincere
heart
with
lowliness
of
mind
without
wishing
to
criticise
it
and
you
will
find
it
of
good
to
you
receive
it
with
the
same
spirit
as
that
in
which
it
is
given
which
is
no
other
than
the
longing
that
you
may
be
led
to
yourself
unreservedly
to
my
desire
is
that
it
may
be
the
means
of
leading
the
simple
ones
and
the
children
to
their
father
who
loves
their
humble
confidence
and
to
whom
distrust
is
so
displeasing
seek
nothing
but
love
of
have
a
sincere
desire
for
your
salvation
and
you
will
assuredly
find
it
following
this
little
unmethodical
method
i
do
not
pretend
to
elevate
my
sentiments
above
those
of
others
but
i
relate
simply
what
has
been
my
own
experience
as
well
as
that
of
others
and
the
advantage
which
i
have
found
in
this
simple
and
natural
manner
of
going
to
god
if
this
book
treats
of
nothing
else
but
the
and
easy
method
of
it
is
because
being
written
only
for
that
it
can
not
speak
of
other
things
it
is
certain
that
if
it
be
read
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
has
been
written
there
will
be
found
nothing
in
it
to
shock
the
mind
those
who
will
make
the
experience
of
it
will
be
the
most
certain
of
the
truth
which
it
contains
it
is
to
thee
o
holy
child
jesus
who
lovest
simplicity
and
innocence
and
who
findest
thy
delight
in
the
children
of
men
that
is
to
say
with
those
amongst
men
who
are
willing
to
become
children
it
is
to
thee
i
say
to
give
worth
and
value
to
this
little
work
impressing
it
on
the
heart
and
leading
those
who
read
it
to
seek
thee
within
themselves
where
thou
wilt
take
thy
rest
receiving
the
tokens
of
their
love
and
giving
them
proofs
of
thine
it
is
thy
work
o
divine
child
o
uncreated
love
o
silent
word
to
make
thyself
beloved
tasted
and
heard
thou
art
able
to
do
it
and
i
even
dare
to
say
that
thou
wilt
do
it
by
means
of
this
little
work
which
is
all
to
thee
all
of
thee
and
all
for
thee
a

chapter
i
all
are
commanded
to
pray

the
great
means
of
salvation
and
possible
at
all
times
by
the
most
simple
prayer
is
nothing
else
but
the
of
the
heart
to
and
the
interior
exercise
of
love
st
paul
commands
us
to
pray
without
ceasing

our
lord
says
take
ye
heed
watch
and
pray
and
what
i
say
unto
you
i
say
unto
all
mark
xiii
all
then
are
capable
of
prayer
and
it
is
the
duty
of
all
to
engage
in
it
but
i
do
not
think
that
all
are
fit
for
meditation
and
therefore
it
is
not
that
sort
of
prayer
which
god
demands
or
desires
of
them
my
dear
friends
whoever
you
may
be
who
desire
to
be
saved
come

christ
calls
you
all
let
those
only
refuse
to
come
who
have
no
heart
the
invitation
is
not
for
them
for
we
must
have
a
heart
in
order
to
love
but
who
is
indeed
without
heart
oh
come
and
give
that
heart
to
god
and
learn
in
the
place
of
prayer
how
to
do
it
all
those
who
long
for
prayer
are
capable
of
it
who
have
ordinary
grace
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
which
is
freely
promised
to
all
who
ask
it
prayer
is
the
key
of
perfection
and
of
sovereign
happiness
it
is
the
efficacious
means
of
getting
rid
of
all
vices
and
of
acquiring
all
virtues
for
the
way
to
become
perfect
is
to
live
in
the
presence
of
god
he
tells
us
this
himself
walk
before
me
and
be
thou
perfect
xvii
prayer
alone
can
bring
you
into
his
presence
and
keep
you
there
continually
what
we
need
then
is
an
attitude
of
prayer
in
which
we
can
abide
and
out
of
which
exterior
occupations
can
not
draw
us
a
prayer
which
can
be
offered
alike
by
princes
kings
prelates
magistrates
soldiers
children
artisans
labourers
women
and
the
sick
this
prayer
is
not
mental
but
the
it
is
not
a
prayer
of
thought
alone
because
the
mind
of
man
is
so
limited
that
while
it
is
occupied
with
one
thing
it
can
not
be
thinking
of
another
but
it
is
the
prayer
of
the
heart
which
can
not
be
interrupted
by
the
occupations
of
the
mind
nothing
can
interrupt
the
prayer
of
the
heart
but
unruly
affections
and
when
once
we
have
tasted
of
the
love
of
god
it
is
impossible
to
find
our
delight
in
anything
but
himself
nothing
is
easier
than
to
have
god
and
to
live
upon
him
he
is
more
truly
in
us
than
we
are
in
ourselves
he
is
more
anxious
to
give
himself
to
us
than
we
are
to
possess
him
all
that
we
want
is
to
know
the
way
to
seek
him
which
is
so
easy
and
so
natural
that
breathing
itself
is
not
more
so
oh
you
who
imagine
yourselves
incapable
of
religious
feeling
you
may
live
in
prayer
and
in
god
as
easily
and
as
continuously
as
you
live
by
the
air
you
breathe
will
you
not
then
be
inexcusable
if
you
neglect
to
do
it
after
you
have
learned
the
way
chapter
ii
first
degree
of
prayer
meditation
and
meditative
reading
the
prayer
passage
from
the
first
degree
to
the
second
there
are
two
means
by
which
we
may
be
led
into
the
higher
forms
of
prayer
one
is
the
other
is
by
meditative
reading
i
mean
the
taking
of
some
truths
either
doctrinal
or
practical
the
latter
rather
than
the
former
and
reading
them
in
this
way
take
the
truth
which
has
presented
itself
to
you
and
read
two
or
three
lines
seeking
to
enter
into
the
full
meaning
of
the
words
and
go
on
no
further
so
long
as
you
find
satisfaction
in
them
leave
the
place
only
when
it
becomes
insipid
after
that
take
another
passage
and
do
the
same
not
reading
more
than
half
a
page
at
once
it
is
not
so
much
from
the
amount
read
that
we
derive
profit
as
from
the
manner
of
reading
those
people
who
get
through
so
much
do
not
profit
from
it
the
bees
can
only
draw
the
juice
from
the
flowers
by
resting
on
them
not
by
flying
round
them
much
reading
is
more
for
scholastic
than
for
spiritual
science
but
in
order
to
derive
profit
from
spiritual
books
we
should
read
them
in
this
way
and
i
am
sure
that
this
manner
of
reading
accustoms
us
gradually
to
prayer
and
gives
us
a
deeper
desire
for
it
the
other
way
is
in
which
we
should
engage
at
a
chosen
time
and
not
in
the
hour
given
to
reading
i
think
the
way
to
enter
into
it
is
this
after
having
brought
ourselves
into
the
presence
of
god
by
a
definite
act
of
faith
we
should
read
something
substantial
not
so
much
to
reason
upon
it
as
to
fix
the
attention
observing
that
the
principal
exercise
should
be
the
presence
of
god
and
that
the
subject
should
rather
fix
the
attention
than
exercise
reason
this
in
the
presence
of
god
within
our
must
lead
us
to
enter
within
ourselves
collecting
our
thoughts
and
preventing
their
wandering
this
is
an
effectual
way
of
getting
rid
of
distracting
thoughts
and
of
losing
sight
of
outward
things
in
order
to
draw
near
to
god
who
can
only
be
found
in
the
secret
place
of
our
hearts
which
is
the
in
which
he
dwells
he
has
promised
that
if
any
one
keeps
his
commandments
he
will
come
to
him
and
his
with
him
john
xiv
st
augustine
reproaches
himself
for
the
time
he
lost
through
not
having
sought
god
at
first
in
this
way
when
then
we
are
thus
buried
in
ourselves
and
deeply
penetrated
with
the
presence
of
god
within
us
when
the
senses
are
all
drawn
from
the
circumference
to
the
centre
which
though
it
is
not
easily
accomplished
at
first
becomes
quite
natural
afterwards
when
the
soul
is
thus
gathered
up
within
itself
and
is
sweetly
occupied
with
the
truth
read
not
in
reasoning
upon
it
but
in
feeding
upon
it
and
exciting
the
will
by
the
affection
rather
than
the
understanding
by
consideration
the
being
thus
touched
must
be
suffered
to
sweetly
and
at
peace
what
it
has
tasted
as
a
person
who
only
masticated
an
excellent
meat
would
not
be
nourished
by
it
although
he
would
be
sensible
of
its
taste
unless
he
ceased
this
movement
in
order
to
swallow
it
so
when
the
affection
is
stirred
if
we
seek
continually
to
stir
it
we
extinguish
its
fire
and
thus
deprive
the
soul
of
its
nourishment
we
must
swallow
by
a
full
of
respect
and
confidence
what
we
have
masticated
and
tasted
this
method
is
very
necessary
and
would
advance
the
soul
in
a
short
time
more
than
any
other
would
do
in
several
years
but
as
i
said
that
the
direct
and
principal
exercise
should
be
the
of
the
presence
of
we
must
most
faithfully
the
when
they
wander
this
is
a
short
and
efficacious
way
of
fighting
with
distractions
because
those
who
endeavour
directly
to
oppose
them
irritate
and
increase
them
but
by
losing
ourselves
in
the
thought
of
a
present
god
and
suffering
our
thoughts
to
be
drawn
to
him
we
combat
them
indirectly
and
without
thinking
of
them
but
in
an
effectual
manner
and
here
let
me
warn
beginners
not
to
run
from
one
truth
to
another
from
one
subject
to
another
but
to
keep
themselves
to
one
so
long
as
they
feel
a
taste
for
it
this
is
the
way
to
enter
deeply
into
truths
to
taste
them
and
to
have
them
impressed
upon
us
i
say
it
is
difficult
at
first
thus
to
retire
within
ourselves
because
of
the
habits
which
are
natural
to
us
of
being
taken
up
with
the
outside
but
when
we
are
a
little
accustomed
to
it
it
becomes
exceedingly
easy
both
because
we
have
formed
the
habit
of
it
and
because
god
who
only
desires
to
communicate
himself
to
us
sends
us
abundant
grace
and
an
experimental
sense
of
his
presence
which
renders
it
easy
let
us
apply
this
method
to
the
lord
prayer
we
say
our
father
thinking
that
god
is
within
us
and
will
indeed
be
our
father
after
having
pronounced
this
word
we
remain
a
few
moments
in
silence
waiting
for
this
heavenly
father
to
make
known
his
will
to
us
then
we
ask
this
king
of
glory
within
us
abandoning
ourselves
to
him
that
he
may
do
it
and
yielding
to
him
the
right
that
he
has
over
us
if
we
feel
here
an
inclination
to
peace
and
silence
we
should
not
continue
but
remain
thus
so
long
as
the
condition
may
last
after
which
we
proceed
to
the
second
petition
thy
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
we
then
desire
that
god
may
accomplish
in
us
and
by
us
all
his
will
we
give
up
to
god
our
heart
and
our
liberty
that
he
may
dispose
of
them
at
his
pleasure
then
seeing
that
the
occupation
of
the
will
should
be
love
we
desire
to
love
and
we
ask
god
to
give
us
but
all
this
is
done
quietly
peacefully
and
so
on
with
the
rest
of
the
prayer
at
other
times
we
hold
ourselves
in
the
position
of
sheep
near
to
the
shepherd
asking
of
him
our
true
food
o
divine
shepherd
thou
feedest
thy
sheep
with
thine
own
hand
and
thou
art
their
food
from
day
to
day
we
may
also
bring
before
him
our
family
desires
but
it
must
all
be
done
with
the
remembrance
by
faith
of
the
presence
of
god
within
us
we
can
form
no
imagination
of
what
god
is
a
lively
faith
in
his
presence
is
sufficient
for
we
can
conceive
no
image
of
god
though
we
may
of
christ
regarding
him
as
crucified
or
as
a
child
or
in
some
other
condition
provided
that
we
always
seek
him
within
ourselves
at
other
times
we
come
to
him
as
to
a
physician
bringing
our
maladies
to
him
that
he
may
heal
them
but
always
without
effort
with
a
short
silence
from
time
to
time
that
the
silence
may
be
mingled
with
the
action
gradually
lengthening
the
silence
and
shortening
the
spoken
prayer
until
at
length
as
we
yield
to
the
operation
of
god
he
gains
the
supremacy
when
the
presence
of
god
is
given
and
the
soul
begins
to
taste
of
silence
and
repose
this
experimental
sense
of
the
presence
of
god
introduces
it
to
the
second
degree
of
prayer
chapter
iii
second
degree
of
prayer
called
here
the
prayer
of
simplicity
the
second
degree
has
been
variously
termed
prayer
of
and
while
others
again
have
called
it
the
of
and
it
is
of
this
last
term
that
i
shall
make
use
here
being
more
appropriate
than
that
of
which
signifies
a
degree
of
prayer
more
advanced
than
that
of
which
i
speak
after
a
time
as
i
have
said
the
soul
becomes
sensible
of
a
facility
in
recognising
the
presence
of
god
it
collects
itself
more
easily
prayer
becomes
natural
and
pleasant
it
knows
that
it
leads
to
god
and
it
perceives
the
smell
of
his
perfumes
then
it
must
change
its
method
and
observe
carefully
what
i
am
about
to
say
without
being
astonished
at
its
apparent
implausibility
first
of
all
when
you
bring
yourself
into
the
presence
of
god
by
faith
remain
a
short
time
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
silence
if
from
the
beginning
in
making
this
act
of
faith
you
are
sensible
of
a
little
taste
of
the
presence
of
god
remain
as
you
are
without
troubling
yourself
on
any
subject
and
keep
that
which
has
been
given
you
so
long
as
it
may
remain
if
it
leaves
you
excite
your
will
by
means
of
some
tender
affection
and
if
you
then
find
that
your
former
state
of
peace
has
returned
remain
in
it
the
fire
must
be
blown
softly
and
as
soon
as
it
is
lighted
cease
to
blow
it
or
you
will
put
it
out
it
is
also
necessary
that
you
should
go
to
god
not
so
much
to
obtain
something
from
him
as
to
please
him
and
to
do
his
will
for
a
servant
who
only
serves
his
master
in
proportion
to
the
recompense
he
receives
is
unworthy
of
any
remuneration
go
then
to
prayer
not
only
to
enjoy
god
but
to
be
as
he
wills
this
will
keep
you
equal
in
times
of
barrenness
and
in
times
of
abundance
and
you
will
not
be
dismayed
by
the
repulses
of
god
nor
by
his
apparent
indifference
chapter

on

dryness
as
god
only
desire
is
to
give
himself
to
the
loving
soul
who
desires
to
seek
him
he
often
hides
himself
in
order
to
arouse
it
and
compel
it
to
seek
him
with
love
and
fidelity
but
how
does
he
reward
the
faithfulness
of
his
beloved
and
how
are
his
apparent
flights
followed
by
loving
caresses
the
soul
imagines
that
it
is
a
proof
of
its
fidelity
and
of
its
increased
love
that
it
seeks
god
with
an
effort
or
that
at
least
such
seeking
will
soon
lead
to
his
return
but
no
this
is
not
the
way
in
this

with
a
loving
impatience
with
deep
humility
and
abasement
with
an
affection
deep
and
yet
restful
with
a
respectful
silence
you
must
await
the
return
of
your
beloved
you
will
thus
show
him
that
it
is
alone
that
you
love

his
good
pleasure

not
the
pleasure
that
you
find
in
loving
him

not

cleave
unto

abandonment
to
god
its
fruit
and
its
irrevocability
in
what
it
consists
god
exhorts
us
to
it
it
is
here
that
true
and
consecration
to
god
should
commence
by
our
being
deeply
convinced
that
all
which
happens
to
us
moment
by
moment
is
the
will
of
god
and
therefore
all
that
is
necessary
to
us
this
conviction
will
render
us
contented
with
everything
and
will
make
us
see
the
commonest
events
in
god
and
not
in
the
creature
i
beg
of
you
whoever
you
may
be
who
are
desirous
of
giving
yourselves
to
god
not
to
take
yourselves
back
when
once
you
are
given
to
him
and
to
remember
that
a
thing
once
given
away
is
no
longer
at
your
disposal
is
the
key
to
the
inner
life
he
who
is
thoroughly
abandoned
will
soon
be
perfect
you
must
then
hold
firmly
to
your
abandonment
without
listening
to
reason
or
to

a

makes
a

abandonment
then
ought
to
be
an
utter
leaving
of
ourselves
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
in
the
hands
of
god
forgetting
ourselves
and
thinking
only
of
god
by
this
means
the

kept
always
free

practically
it
should
be
a
continual
loss

our
own

of
god
a
renunciation
of
all
natural
inclinations
however
good
they
may
appear
in
order
that
we
may
be
left
free
to
choose
only
as
god
chooses
we
should
be
indifferent
to
all
things
whether
temporal
or
spiritual
for
the
body
or
the
soul
leaving
the
past
in
forgetfulness

those
people
who
give

at

take
themselves
back
at

they
give
themselves
to
be
caressed
and
take
themselves
back
when
they
are
crucified
or
else
they
seek
for
consolation
in

you
can
only
find
consolation
in
the
love
of
the
cross
and
in
complete
abandonment
he
who
has
no
love
for
the

has
no
love
for

see

it
is
impossible
to
love
god
without
loving
the
cross
and
a
heart
which
has
learned
to
love
the
cross
finds
sweetness
joy
and
pleasure
even
in
the
bitterest
things
to
the
hungry
soul
every
bitter
thing
is
sweet
prov

because
it
is
as
hungry
for
the
cross
as
it
is
hungry
for
god
the
cross
gives
god
and
god
gives
the
cross
abandonment
and
the
cross
go
together
as
soon
as
you
are
sensible
that
something
is
repugnant
to
you
which
presents
itself
to
you
in
the
light
of
suffering
abandon
yourself
at
once
to
god
for
that
very
thing
and
present
yourself
as
a
sacrifice
to
him
you
will
see
that
when
the
cross
comes
it
will
have
lost
much
of
its
weight
because
you
will
desire
it
this
will
not
prevent
your
being
sensible
of
its
weight
some
people
imagine
that
it
is
not
suffering
to
feel
the
cross
the
feeling
of
suffering
is
one
of
the
principal
parts
of
suffering
itself
jesus
himself
was
willing
to
suffer
it
in
its
intensity
often
the
cross
is
borne
with
weakness
at
other
times
with
strength
all
should
be
equal
in
the
will
of
god
chapter
vii
on
mysteries
god
gives
them
here
in
reality
it
will
be
objected
that
by
this
way
mysteries
will
not
be
made
known
it
is
just
the
contrary
they
are
given
to
the
soul
in
reality
jesus
christ
to
whom
it
is
abandoned
and
whom
it
follows
as
the
whom
it
hears
as
the
and
who
animates
it
as
the
impressing
himself
upon
it
imparts
to
it
his
own
condition
to
bear
the
conditions
of
christ
is
something
far
greater
than
merely
to
consider
those
conditions
paul
bore
the
conditions
of
christ
on
his
body
i
bear
in
my
body
he
says
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
gal
vi
but
he
does
not
say
that
he
reasoned
about
them
often
christ
gives
in
this
state
of
abandonment
views
of
his
conditions
in
a
striking
manner
we
must
receive
equally
all
the
dispositions
in
which
he
may
be
pleased
to
place
us
choosing
for
ourselves
to
abide
near
to
him
and
to
be
annihilated
before
him
but
receiving
equally
all
that
he
gives
us
light
or
darkness
facility
or
barrenness
strength
or
weakness
sweetness
or
bitterness
temptations
or
distractions
sorrow
care
uncertainty
none
of
these
things
ought
to
move
us
there
are
some
persons
to
whom
god
is
continually
revealing
his
mysteries
let
them
be
faithful
to
them
but
when
god
sees
fit
to
remove
them
let
them
suffer
them
to
be
taken
others
are
troubled
because
no
mysteries
are
made
known
to
them
this
is
needless
since
a
loving
attention
to
god
includes
all
particular
devotion
and
that
which
is
united
to
god
alone
by
its
rest
in
him
is
instructed
in
a
most
excellent
manner
in
all
mysteries
he
who
loves
god
loves
all
that
is
of
him
chapter
viii
on
virtue
all
virtues
given
with
god
in
this
degree
of
the
prayer
of
the
heart
this
is
the
short
and
the
sure
way
of
acquiring
virtue
because
god
being
the
principle
of
all
virtue
we
possess
all
virtue
in
possessing
god
more
than
this
i
say
that
all
virtue
which
is
not
given
inwardly
is
a
mask
of
virtue
and
like
a
garment
that
can
be
taken
off
and
will
wear
out
but
virtue
communicated
fundamentally
is
essential
true
and
permanent
the
king
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
ps
xlv
and
there
are
none
who
practise
virtue
more
constantly
than
those
who
acquire
it
in
this
way
though
virtue
is
not
a
distinct
subject
of
their
thought
how
hungry
these
loving
ones
are
after
suffering
they
think
only
of
what
can
please
their
beloved
and
they
begin
to
neglect
themselves
and
to
think
less
of
themselves
the
more
they
love
god
the
more
they
hate
themselves
oh
if
all
could
learn
this
method
so
easy
that
it
is
suited
for
all
for
the
most
ignorant

for
the

chapter
ix
of
perfect
conversion
which
is
an
effect
of
this
method
of
prayer
two
of
its
aids
the
attraction
of
god
and
the
central
inclination
of
the
soul
turn
ye
unto
him
from
whom
the
children
of
israel
have
deeply
revolted
isa
xxxi
conversion
is
nothing
else
but
a
turning
from
the
creature
to
god
conversion
is
not
perfect
though
it
is
necessary
for
salvation
when
it
is
merely
a
turning
from
sin
to
grace
to
be
complete
it
must
be
a
turning
from
without
to
within
the
soul
being
turned
in
the
direction
of
god
has
a
great
facility
for
remaining
converted
to
him
the
longer
it
is
converted
the
nearer
it
approaches
to
god
and
attaches
itself
to
him
and
the
nearer
it
approaches
to
god
the
more
it
becomes
necessarily
drawn
from
the
creature
which
is
opposed
to
god
but
this
can
not
be
done
by
a
violent
effort
of
the
creature
all
that
it
can
do
is
to
remain
turned
in
the
direction
of
god
in
a
perpetual
adherence
god
has
an
which
draws
the
soul
more
strongly
towards
himself
and
in
attracting
it
he
purifies
it
as
we
see
the
sun
attracting
a
dense
vapour
and
gradually
without
any
other
effort
on
the
part
of
the
vapour
than
that
of
letting
itself
be
drawn
the
sun
by
bringing
it
near
to
himself
refines
and
purifies
it
there
is
however
this
difference
that
the
vapour
is
not
drawn
freely
and
does
not
follow
willingly
as
is
the
case
with
the
soul
this
manner
of
turning
within
is
very
simple
and
makes
the
soul
advance
naturally
and
without
effort
because
god
is
its
centre
the
centre
has
always
a
strong
attractive
power
and
the
larger
the
centre
the
stronger
is
its
attractive
force
besides
this
attraction
of
the
centre
there
is
given
to
all
natural
objects
a
strong
tendency
to
become
united
with
their
centre
as
soon
as
anything
is
turned
in
the
direction
of
its
centre
unless
it
be
stopped
by
some
invincible
obstacle
it
rushes
towards
it
with
extreme
velocity
a
stone
in
the
air
is
no
sooner
let
loose
and
turned
towards
the
earth
than
it
tends
to
it
by
its
own
weight
as
its
centre
it
is
the
same
with
fire
and
water
which
being
no
longer
arrested
run
incessantly
towards
their
centre
now
i
say
that
the
soul
by
the
effort
it
has
made
in
inward
recollection
being
turned
towards
its
centre
without
any
other
effort
but
simply
by
the
weight
of
love
falls
towards
its
centre
and
the
more
it
remains
quiet
and
at
rest
making
no
movement
of
its
own
the
more
rapidly
it
will
advance
because
it
thus
allows
that
attractive
virtue
to
draw
it
all
the
care
then
that
we
need
have
is
to
promote
this
inward
recollection
as
much
as
possible
not
being
astonished
at
the
difficulty
we
may
find
in
this
exercise
which
will
soon
be
recompensed
with
a
wonderful
on
the
part
of
god
which
will
render
it
very
easy
when
the
passions
rise
a
look
towards
god
who
is
present
within
us
easily
deadens
them
any
other
resistance
would
irritate
rather
than
appease
them
chapter
x
higher
degree
of
prayer
which
is
that
of
the
simple
presence
of
god
or
active
contemplation
the
soul
faithfully
exercising
itself
in
the
affection
and
love
of
its
god
is
astonished
to
find
him
taking
complete
possession
of
it
his
presence
becomes
so
natural
that
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
have
it
it
becomes
habitual
to
the
soul
which
is
also
conscious
of
a
great
calm
spreading
over
it
its
prayer
is
all
silence
and
god
imparts
to
it
an
intrinsic
love
which
is
the
commencement
of
ineffable
happiness
oh
if
i
could
describe
the
infinite
degrees
which
follow
but
i
must
stop
here
since
i
am
writing
for
beginners
and
wait
till
god
shall
bring
to
light
what
may
be
useful
to
those
more
advanced
i
can
only
say
that
at
this
point
it
is
most
important
that
all
natural
operation
should
cease
that
god
may
act
alone
be
still
and
know
that
i
am
god
is
his
own
word
by
david
ps
xlvi
this
subject
is
pursued
in
the
treatise
entitled
spiritual
torrents
but
man
is
so
attached
to
his
own
works
that
he
can
not
believe
god
is
working
unless
he
can
feel
know
and
distinguish
his
operation
he
does
not
see
that
it
is
the
speed
of
his
course
which
prevents
his
seeing
the
extent
of
his
advancement
and
that
the
operation
of
god
becoming
more
abundant
absorbs
that
of
the
creature
as
we
see
that
the
sun
in
proportion
as
he
rises
absorbs
the
light
of
the
stars
which
were
easily
distinguishable
before
he
appeared
it
is
not
the
want
of
light
but
an
excess
of
light
which
prevents
our
distinguishing
the
stars
it
is
the
same
here
man
can
no
longer
distinguish
his
own
operation
because
the
strong
light
absorbs
all
his
little
distinct
lights
and
makes
them
fade
away
entirely
because
god
excess
surpasses
them
all
so
that
those
who
accuse
this
degree
of
prayer
of
being
a
state
of
are
greatly
deceived
and
only
speak
thus
from
want
of
experience
oh
if
they
would
only
prove
it
in
how
short
a
time
they
would
become
experimentally
acquainted
with
this
matter
i
say
then
that
this
failure
of
work
does
not
spring
from
scarcity
but
from
abundance
two
classes
of
persons
are
silent
the
one
because
they
have
nothing
to
say
the
other
because
they
have
too
much
it
is
thus
in
this
degree
we
are
silent
from
excess
not
from
want
water
causes
death
to
two
persons
in
very
different
ways
one
dies
of
thirst
another
is
drowned
the
one
dies
from
want
the
other
from
abundance
so
here
it
is
abundance
which
causes
the
cessation
of
natural
operation
it
is
therefore
important
in
this
degree
to
remain
as
much
as
possible
in
stillness
at
the
commencement
of
this
prayer
a
movement
of
affection
is
necessary
but
when
grace
begins
to
flow
into
us
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
remain
at
rest
and
take
all
that
god
gives
any
other
movement
would
prevent
our
profiting
by
this
grace
which
is
given
in
order
to
draw
us
into
the
of
the
soul
in
this
peaceful
attitude
of
prayer
falls
into
a
mystic
sleep
in
which
all
its
natural
powers
are
silenced
until
that
which
had
been
temporary
becomes
its
permanent
condition
you
see
that
the
soul
is
thus
led
without
effort
without
study
without
artifice
the
heart
is
not
a
fortified
place
which
must
be
taken
by
cannonading
and
violence
it
is
a
kingdom
of
peace
which
is
possessed
by
love
gently
following
in
his
train
you
will
soon
reach
the
degree
of
prayer
god
asks
nothing
extraordinary
and
difficult
on
the
contrary
he
is
most
pleased
with
childlike
simplicity
the
grandest
part
of
religion
is
the
most
simple
it
is
the
same
with
natural
things
do
you
wish
to
get
to
the
sea
embark
upon
a
river
and
insensibly
and
without
effort
you
will
be
taken
to
it
do
you
wish
to
get
to
god
take
his
way
so
quiet
so
easy
and
in
a
little
while
you
will
be
taken
to
him
in
a
manner
that
will
surprise
you
oh
if
only
you
would
try
it
how
soon
you
would
see
that
i
am
telling
you
only
too
little
and
that
the
experience
would
far
surpass
any
description
that
could
be
given
what
do
you
fear
why
do
you
not
throw
yourself
at
once
into
the
arms
of
love
who
only
stretched
them
out
upon
the
cross
in
order
to
take
you
in
what
risk
can
there
be
in
trusting
god
and
abandoning
yourself
to
him
oh
he
will
not
deceive
you
unless
it
be
by
giving
you
far
more
than
you
ever
expected
while
those
who
expect
everything
from
themselves
may
well
take
to
themselves
the
reproach
which
god
utters
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
thou
art
wearied
in
the
greatness
of
thy
way
yet
saidst
thou
not
there
is

lvii
chapter
xi
of
rest
in
the
presence
of
god
its
fruits
inward
silence
god
commands
it
outward
silence
the
soul
being
brought
to
this
place
needs
no
other
preparation
than
that
of
repose
for
presence
of
during
the
day
which
is
the
great
result
of
prayer
or
rather
prayer
itself
begins
to
be
and
the
soul
is
conscious
of
a
deep
inward
happiness
and
feels
that
god
is
in
it
more
truly
than
it
is
in
itself
it
has
only
one
thing
to
do
in
order
to
find
god
which
is
to
retire
within
itself
as
soon
as
the
eyes
are
closed
it
finds
itself
in
prayer
it
is
astonished
at
this
infinite
happiness
there
is
carried
on
within
it
a
conversation
which
outward
things
can
not
interrupt
it
might
be
said
of
this
method
of
prayer
as
was
said
of
wisdom
all
good
things
together
come
to
me
with
her
wisdom
of
solomon
vii
for
virtue
flows
naturally
into
the
soul
and
is
practised
so
easily
that
it
seems
to
be
quite
natural
to
it
it
has
within
it
a
germ
of
life
and
fruitfulness
which
gives
it
a
facility
for
all
good
and
an
insensibility
to
all
evil
let
it
then
remain
faithful
and
seek
no
other
frame
of
mind
than
that
of
simple
rest
it
has
only
to
suffer
itself
to
be
filled
with
this
divine
effusion
the
lord
is
in
his
holy
temple
let
all
the
earth
keep
silence
before
him
hab
ii
the
reason
why
inward
silence
is
so
necessary
is
that
christ
being
the
eternal
and
essential
word
in
order
that
he
may
be
received
into
the
soul
there
must
be
a
disposition
corresponding
with
what
he
is
now
it
is
certain
that
in
order
to
receive
words
we
must
listen
hearing
is
the
sense
given
to
enable
us
to
receive
the
words
which
are
communicated
to
us
hearing
is
rather
a
passive
than
an
active
sense
receiving
and
not
communicating
christ
being
the
word
which
is
to
be
communicated
the
soul
must
be
attentive
to
this
word
which
speaks
within
it
this
is
why
we
are
so
often
exhorted
to
listen
to
god
and
to
be
attentive
to
his
voice
many
passages
might
be
quoted
i
will
be
content
to
mention
a
few
hearken

me
o
my
people

give
ear

ps

we
must
to
god
and
be
attentive
to
him
and
all
these
two
actions
or
rather
passions
for
this
condition
is
essentially
a
passive
one
arouse
in
god
a
desire
towards
the
beauty
he
has
himself
communicated
outward
silence
is
extremely
necessary
for
the
cultivation
of
inward
silence
and
it
is
impossible
to
acquire
inward
silence
without
having
a
love
for
silence
and
solitude
god
tells
us

the
mouth
of
his
prophet

reading
of

to
be
inwardly
occupied
with
god
and
outwardly
occupied
with
countless
trifles
this
is
impossible
it
will
be
a
small
matter
to
pray
and
to
retire
within
ourselves
for
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
if
we
do
not
retain
the
unction
and
the
spirit
of
prayer
during
the
day
chapter
xii
and
confession
should
always
precede
confession
those
who
arrive
at
this
degree
should
expose
themselves
to
god
who
will
not
fail
to
enlighten
them
and
to
make
known
to
them
the
nature
of
their
faults
this
examination
must
be
conducted
in
peace
and
tranquillity
expecting
more
from
god
than
from
our
own
research
the
knowledge
of
our
sins
when
we
examine
ourselves
with
an
effort
we
easily
make
mistakes
we
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
and
easily
deceives
us
but
when
we
remain
exposed
to
the
searching
gaze
of
god
that
divine
sun
brings
to
light
even
the
smallest
atoms
we
must
then
for
abandon
ourselves
utterly
to
god
when
we
are
in
this
degree
of
prayer
god
is
not
slow
to
reveal
to
us
all
the
faults
we
commit
we
have
no
sooner
sinned
than
we
feel
a
burning
reproach
it
is
god
himself
who
conducts
an
examination
which
nothing
escapes
and
we
have
only
to
turn
towards
god
and
suffer
the
pain
and
the
correction
which
he
gives
as
this
examination
by
god
is
continual
we
can
no
longer
examine
ourselves
and
if
we
are
faithful
to
our
abandonment
to
god
we
shall
soon
be
better
examined
by
the
divine
light
than
we
could
be
by
all
our
own
efforts
experience
will
make
this
known
one
thing
which
often
causes
astonishment
to
the
soul
is
that
when
it
is
conscious
of
a
sin
and
comes
to
confess
it
to
god
instead
of
feeling
regret
and
contrition
such
as
it
formerly
felt
a
sweet
and
gentle
love
takes
possession
of
it
not
having
experienced
this
before
it
supposes
that
it
ought
to
draw
itself
out
of
this
condition
to
make
a
definite
act
of
contrition
but
it
does
not
see
that
by
doing
this
it
would
lose
true
contrition
which
is
this
infinitely
greater
than
anything
it
could
create
for
itself
it
is
a
higher
action
which
includes
the
others
with
greater
perfection
though
these
are
not
possessed
distinctly
we
should
not
seek
to
do
anything
for
ourselves
when
god
acts
more
excellently
in
us
and
for
us
it
is
hating
sin
as
god
hates
it
to
hate
it
in
this
way
this
love
which
is
the
operation
of
god
in
the
soul
is
the
purest
of
all
love
all
we
have
to
do
then
is
to
remain
as
we
are
another
remarkable
thing
is
that
we
often
forget
our
faults
and
find
it
difficult
to
remember
them
but
this
must
not
trouble
us
for
two
reasons
the
first
that
this
very
forgetfulness
is
a
proof
that
the
sin
has
been
atoned
for
and
it
is
better
to
forget
all
that
concerns
ourselves
that
we
may
remember
god
alone
the
second
reason
is
that
god
does
not
fail
whenever
confession
is
needful
to
show
to
the
soul
its
greatest
faults
for
then
it
is
he
himself
who
examines
it
chapter

on
reading
vocal
prayer
requests
the
proper
manner
of
reading
in
this
degree
is
as
soon
as
we
feel
attracted
to
meditation
to
cease
reading
and
remain
at
rest
the
soul
is
no
sooner
called
to
inward
silence
than
it
should
cease
to
utter
vocal
prayers
saying
but
little
at
any
time
and
when
it
does
say
them
if
it
finds
any
difficulty
or
feels
itself
drawn
to
silence
it
should
remain
silent
and
make
no
effort
to
pray
leaving
itself
to
the
guidance
of
the
spirit
of

will
find
that
it
can
not
as
formerly
present
definite
requests
to
god
this
need
not
surprise
it
for
it
is
now
that
the
spirit
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
god
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
rom

we
must
second
the
designs
of
god
which
are
to
strip
the
soul
of
its
own
works
to
substitute
his
in
their
place
let
him
work
then
and
bind
yourself
to
nothing
of
your
own
however
good
it
may
appear
to
you
it
can
not
be
so
if
it
comes
in
the
way
of
god
will
for
you
the
will
of
god
is
preferable
to
all
other
good
seek
not
your
own
interests
but
live
by
abandonment
and
by
faith
it
is
here
that
begins
to
operate
wonderfully
in
the
soul
chapter

the
faults
committed
in
this
degree
distractions
temptations
the
course
to
be
pursued
respecting
them
as
soon
as
we
fall
into
a
fault
or
have
wandered
we
must
turn
again
within
ourselves
because
this
fault
having
turned
us
from
god
we
should
as
soon
as
possible
turn
towards
him
and
suffer
the
penitence
which
he
himself
will
give
it
is
of
great
importance
that
we
should
not
be
anxious
about
these
faults
because
the
anxiety
only
springs
from
a
secret
pride
and
a
love
of
our
own
excellence
we
are
troubled
at
feeling
what
we
are
if
we
become
discouraged
we
shall
grow
weaker
yet
and
reflection
upon
our
faults
produces
a
vexation
which
is
worse
than
the
sin
itself
a
truly
humble
soul
does
not
marvel
at
its
weakness
and
the
more
it
perceives
its
wretchedness
the
more
it
abandons
itself
to
god
and
seeks
to
remain
near
to
him
knowing
how
deeply
it
needs
his
help
god
own
word
to
us
is
i
will
instruct
thee
and
teach
thee
in
the
way
which
thou
shalt
go
i
will
guide
thee
with
mine
eye

in
distractions
or
temptations
instead
of
combating
them
directly
which
would
only
serve
to
augment
them
and
to
wean
us
from
god
with
whom
alone
we
ought
to
be
occupied
we
should
simply
turn
away
from
them
and
draw
nearer
to
god
as
a
little
child
seeing
a
fierce
animal
approaching
it
would
not
stay
to
fight
it
nor
even
to
look
at
it
but
would
run
for
shelter
to
its
mother
arms
where
it
would
be
safe
god
is
in
the
midst
of
her
she
shall
not
be
moved
god
shall
help
her
and
that
right
early
ps
xlvi
if
we
adopt
any
other
course
of
action
if
we
attempt
to
attack
our
enemies
in
our
weakness
we
shall
be
wounded
even
if
we
are
not
entirely
defeated
but
remaining
in
the
simple
presence
of
god
we
find
ourselves
immediately
fortified
this
was
what
david
did
he
says
i
have
set
the
lord
always
before
me
because
he
is
at
my
right
hand
i
shall
not
be
moved
therefore
my
heart
is
glad
and
my
glory
rejoiceth
my
flesh
also
shall
rest
in
hope
it
is
also

by
moses

shall
fight
for
you

shall

prayer
and
sacrifice
explained
by
the
similitude
of
a
perfume
our
annihilation
in
this
sacrifice
solidity
and
fruitfulness
of
this
prayer
as
set
forth
in
the
gospel
prayer
ought
to
be
both
petition
and
sacrifice
prayer
according
to
the
testimony
of
st
john
is
an
incense
whose
perfume
rises
to
god
therefore
it
is
said
in
the
revelation
chap
viii
that
an
angel
held
a
censer
which
contained
the
incense
of
the
prayers
of
saints
prayer
is
an
outpouring
of
the
heart
in
the
presence
of
god
i
have
poured
out
my
soul
before
the
lord
said
the
mother
of
samuel
sam
i
thus
the
prayers
of
the
magi
at
the
feet
of
the
infant
jesus
in
the
stable
of
bethlehem
were
signified
by
the
incense
which
they
offered
prayer
is
the
heat
of
love
which
melts
and
dissolves
the
soul
and
carries
it
to
god
in
proportion
as
it
melts
it
gives
out
its
odour
and
this
odour
comes
from
the
love
which
burns
it
this
is
what
the
bride
meant
when
she
said
while
the
king
sitteth
at
his
table
my
spikenard
sendeth
forth
the
smell
thereof
cant
i
the
table
is
the
heart
when
god
is
there
and
we
are
kept
near
to
him
in
his
presence
this
presence
of
god
melts
and
dissolves
the
hardness
of
our
hearts
and
as
they
melt
they
give
forth
their
perfume
therefore
the
bridegroom
seeing
his
bride
thus
melted
by
the
speech
of
her
beloved
says
who
is
this
that
cometh
out
of
the
wilderness
perfumed
with
myrrh
and
frankincense
cant
iii
thus
the
soul
rises
up
towards
its
god
but
in
order
to
this
it
must
suffer
itself
to
be
destroyed
and
annihilated
by
the
force
of
love
this
is
a
state
of
essential
to
the
christian
religion
by
which
the
soul
suffers
itself
to
be
destroyed
and
annihilated
to
render
homage
to
the
sovereignty
of
god
as
it
is
written
the
power
of
the
lord
is
great
and
he
is
honoured
of
the
lowly
ecclus
iii
and
the
destruction
of
our
own
being
confesses
the
sovereign
being
of
god
we
must
cease
to
be
so
that
the
spirit
of
the
word
may
be
in
us
in
order
that
he
may
come
to
us
we
must
yield
our
life
to
him
and
die
to
self
that
he
may
live
in
us
and
that
we
being
dead
our
life
may
be
hidden
with
christ
in
god
iii
come
unto
me
says
god
all
ye
that
be
desirous
of
me
and
fill
yourselves
with
my
fruits
ecclus
xxiv
but
how
can
we
be
filled
with
god
only
by
being
emptied
of
self
and
going
out
of
ourselves
in
order
to
be
lost
in
him
now
this
can
never
be
brought
about
except
by
our
becoming
nothing
nothingness
is
true
prayer
which
renders
to
god
honour
and
glory
and
power
for
ever
and
ever
rev
this
prayer
is
the
prayer
of
truth
it
is
worshipping
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
in
because
we
are
by
it
drawn
out
of
our
human
and
carnal
action
to
enter
into
the
purity
of
the
spirit
who
prays
in
us
and
in
because
the
soul
is
led
into
the
truth
of
the
all
of
god
and
the
nothing
of
the
creature
there
are
but
these
two
truths
the
all
and
the
nothing
all
the
rest
is
untruth
we
can
only
honour
the
all
of
god
by
our
nothingness
and
we
have
no
sooner
become
nothing
than
god
who
will
not
suffer
us
to
be
empty
fills
us
with
himself
oh
if
all
knew
the
blessings
which
come
to
the
soul
by
this
prayer
they
would
be
satisfied
with
no
others
it
is
the
pearl
of
great
price
it
is
the
hidden
treasure
he
who
finds
it
gladly
sells
all
that
he
has
to
buy
it
matt

it
is
the
well
of

water
which
springs
up
into
everlasting
life
john
iv
it
is
the
practice
of
the
pure
maxims
of
the
gospel
does
not
christ
himself
tell
us
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
luke
xvii
this
kingdom
is
set
up
in
two
ways
the
first
is
when
god
is
so
thoroughly
master
of
us
that
nothing
resists
him
then
our
heart
is
truly
his
kingdom
the
other
way
is
that
by
possessing
god
who
is
the
sovereign
lord
we
possess
the
kingdom
of
god
which
is
the
height
of
felicity
and
the
end
for
which
we
were
created
as
it
has
been
said
serve
god
is
to
the
end
for
which
we
were
created
is
to
enjoy
god
in
this
life
and
men
do
not
believe
it
chapter
xvi
this
state
of
prayer
not
one
of
idleness
but
of
noble
action
wrought
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
in
dependence
upon
him
the
communication
of
his
life
and
union
some
people
hearing
of
the
prayer
of
silence
have
wrongly
imagined
that
the
soul
remains
and
but
the
truth
is
that
its
action
is
more
noble
and
more
extensive
than
it
ever
was
before
it
entered
this
degree
since
it
is
moved
by
god
himself
and
acted
upon
by
his
spirit
st
paul
desires
that
we
should
be
by
the
spirit
of
rom
viii
i
do
not
say
that
there
must
be
no
action
but
that
we
must
act
in
dependence
upon
the
divine
movement
this
is
admirably
set
forth
by
ezekiel
the
prophet
saw
wheels
which
had
the
spirit
of
life
and
wherever
this
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
they
went
on
or
stood
or
were
lifted
up
as
they
were
moved
for
the
spirit
of
life
was
in
them
but
they
never
went
back
see
ezek
i
it
should
be
the
same
with
the
soul
it
should
suffer
itself
to
be
moved
and
guided
by
the
living
spirit
who
is
in
it
following
his
direction
and
no
other
now
this
spirit
will
never
lead
it
to
go
backwards
that
is
to
reflect
upon
the
creature
or
to
lean
upon
itself
but
always
to
go
forward
pressing
continually
towards
the
mark
this
action
of
the
soul
is
a
restful
action
when
it
acts
of
itself
it
acts
with
effort
and
is
therefore
more
conscious
of
its
action
but
when
it
acts
in
dependence
upon
the
spirit
of
grace
its
action
is
so
free
so
easy
so
natural
that
it
does
not
seem
to
act
at
all
he
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place
he
delivered
me
because
he
delighted
in
me
ps
xviii
as
soon
as
the
soul
has
commenced
its
course
towards
its
centre
from
that
moment
its
action
becomes
vigorous
that
is
its
course
towards
the
centre
which
attracts
it
which
infinitely
surpasses
the
velocity
of
any
other
movement
see
chap
ix
it
is
action
then
but
an
action
so
so
so
that
it
seems
to
the
soul
as
though
it
were
not
acting
at
all
because
it
rests
as
it
were
naturally
when
a
wheel
is
only
turning
with
a
moderate
speed
it
can
easily
be
distinguished
but
when
it
goes
quickly
no
part
of
it
can
be
distinctly
seen
so
the
soul
which
remains
at
rest
in
god
has
an
action
infinitely
noble
and
exalted
yet
very
peaceful
the
greater
its
peace
the
greater
is
its
velocity
because
it
is
abandoned
to
the
spirit
who
moves
it
and
makes
it
act
this
spirit
is
god
himself
who
draws
us
and
in
drawing
makes
us
run
to
him
as
the
bride
well
knew
when
she
said
draw
me
we
will
run
cant
i
draw
me
o
my
divine
centre
by
my
inmost
heart
my
powers
and
my
sensibilities
will
run
at
thy
attraction
this
attraction
alone
is
a
balm
which
heals
me
and
a
perfume
which
draws
we
will
run
she
says
because
of
the
savour
of
thy
good
ointments
this
attracting
virtue
is
but
the
soul
follows
it
and
as
it
is
equally
strong
and
sweet
it
attracts
by
its
strength
and
delights
by
its
sweetness
the
bride
says
draw
me
we
will
run
she
speaks
of
herself
and
to
herself
draw
there
is
the
unity
of
the
object
which
is
attracted
will
run
there
is
the
correspondence
of
all
the
powers
and
sensibilities
which
follow
in
the
train
of
the
centre
of
the
heart
it
is
not
then
a
question
of
remaining
in
idleness
but
of
acting
dependence
upon
the
spirit
of
who
animates
us
since
it
is
in
him
that
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
acts
xvii
this
calm
dependence
upon
the
spirit
of
god
is
absolutely
necessary
and
causes
the
soul
in
a
short
time
to
attain
the
simplicity
and
unity
in
which
it
was
created
it
was
created
one
and
simple
like
god
in
order
then
to
answer
the
end
of
our
creation
we
must
quit
the
multiplicity
of
our
own
actions
to
enter
into
the
simplicity
and
unity
of
god
in
whose
image
we
were
created
i
the
spirit
of
god
is
one
only
yet
manifold
wisdom
of
solomon
vii
and
its
unity
does
not
prevent
its
multiplicity
we
enter
into
god
unity
when
we
are
united
to
his
spirit
because
then
we
have
the
same
spirit
that
he
has
and
we
are
multiplied
outwardly
as
regards
his
dispositions
without
leaving
the
unity
so
that
as
god
acts
infinitely
and
we
are
of
one
spirit
with
him
we
act
much
more
than
we
could
do
by
our
own
action
we
must
suffer
ourselves
to
be
guided
by
wisdom
this
wisdom
is
more
moving
than
any
motion
wisdom
of
solomon
vii
let
us
then
remain
in
dependence
upon
his
action
and
our
action
will
be
vigorous
indeed
all
things
were
made
by
the
word
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
john
i
god
in
creating
us
created
us
in
his
image
after
his
likeness
i
he
gave
to
us
the
spirit
of
the
word
by
the
breath
of
life
ii
which
he
breathed
into
us
when
we
were
created
in
the
image
of
god
by
the
participation
of
the
life
of
the
word
who
is
the
image
of
his
father
now
this
life
is
one
simple
pure
intimate
and
fruitful
the
devil
having
disfigured
this
beautiful
image
it
became
necessary
that
this
same
word
whose
breath
had
been
breathed
into
us
at
our
creation
should
come
to
restore
it
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
he
because
he
is
the
image
of
the
father
and
a
defaced
image
can
not
be
repaired
by
its
own
action
but
by
the
action
of
him
who
seeks
to
restore
it
our
then
should
be
to
into
a
position
to
suffer
the
action
of
god
and
to
allow
the
word
to
retrace
his
image
in
us
an
image
if
it
could
move
would
by
its
movement
prevent
the
sculptor
perfecting
it
every
movement
of
our
own
hinders
the
work
of
the
heavenly
sculptor
and
produces
false
features
we
must
then
remain
silent
and
only
move
as
he
moves
us
jesus
christ
has
in
john
and
he
must
communicate
life
to
all
who
live
that
this
action
is
the
most
noble
can
not
be
denied
things
are
only
of
value
as
the
principle
in
which
they
originate
is
noble
grand
and
elevated
actions
committed
by
a
divine
principle
are
whereas
the
actions
of
the
creature
however
good
they
may
appear
are
or
at
best
they
are
virtuous
actions
if
they
are
done
with
the
help
of
grace
jesus
says
that
he
has
life
in
himself
all
other
beings
have
but
a
borrowed
life
but
the
word
has
life
in
himself
and
as
he
is
communicative
he
desires
to
communicate
this
life
to
men
we
must
then
give
place
to
this
life
that
it
may
flow
in
us
which
can
only
be
done
by
evacuation
and
the
loss
of
the
life
of
adam
and
of
our
own
action
as
st
paul
assures
us
if
any
man
be
in
christ
he
is
a
new
creature
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
all
things
are
become
new
cor
this
can
only
be
brought
about
by
the
death
of
ourselves
and
of
our
own
action
that
the
action
of
god
may
be
substituted
for
it
we
do
not
profess
then
to
be
without
action
but
only
to
act
in
dependence
upon
the
spirit
of
god
suffering
his
action
to
take
the
place
of
our
own
jesus
shows
us
this
in
the
gospel
martha
did
good
things
but
because
she
did
them
of
her
own
spirit
christ
reproved
her
for
them
the
spirit
of
man
is
turbulent
and
boisterous
therefore
it
does
little
though
it
appears
to
do
much
martha
martha
said
jesus
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
luke

what
had
she
chosen
this

ceased
to
act
that
she
might
be
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
she
ceased
to
live
that
christ
might
live
in
her
this
is
why
it
is
so
necessary
to
renounce
ourselves
and
all
our
own
works
to
follow
jesus
for
we
can
not
follow
him
unless
we
are
animated
with
his
spirit
in
order
that
the
spirit
of
christ
may
dwell
in
us
our
own
spirit
must
give
place
to
him
he
that
is
joined
to
the
lord
says
st
paul
is
one
spirit
cor
vi
it
is
good
for
me
to
draw
near
to
god
i
have
put
my
trust
in
the
lord
god
ps
lxxiii
what
is
this
drawing
near
it
is
the
beginning
of
union
union
has
its
beginning
its
continuation
its
completion
and
its
consummation
the
commencement
of
union
is
an
inclination
towards
god
when
the
soul
is
converted
in
the
manner
i
have
described
it
has
an
inclination
to
its
centre
and
a
strong
tendency
to
union
this
tendency
is
the
commencement
then
it
adheres
which
happens
when
it
approaches
nearer
to
god
then
it
is
united
to
him
and
finally
becomes
one
with
him
that
is
it
becomes
one
spirit
with
him
and
it
is
then
that
this
spirit
which
proceeded
from
god
returns
to
him
as
its
end
it
is
then
necessary
that
we
should
enter
this
way
which
is
the
divine
motion
and
the
spirit
of
jesus
christ
st
paul
says
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
rom
viii
to
be
christ
then
we
must
suffer
ourselves
to
be
filled
with
his
spirit
and
emptied
of
our
own
our
hearts
must
be
evacuated
st
paul
in
the
same
place
proves
to
us
the
necessity
of
this
divine
motion
he
says
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
they
are
the
sons
of
god
rom
viii
the
spirit
is
the
spirit
of
divine
sonship
therefore
the
same
apostle
continues
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
fear
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
we
cry
abba
father
rom
viii
this
spirit
is
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
christ
by
whom
we
participate
in
his
sonship
and
this
spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit
that
we
are
the
sons
of
god
as
soon
as
the
soul
leaves
itself
to
be
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
it
experiences
the
witness
of
this
divine
sonship
and
this
witness
serves
the
more
to
increase
its
joy
as
it
makes
it
know
it
is
called
to
the
liberty
of
the
sons
of
and
that
the
spirit
it
has
received
is
not
a
spirit
of
bondage
but
of
liberty
the
spirit
of
the
divine
motion
is
so
necessary
for
all
things
that
paul
founds
this
necessity
upon
our
ignorance
of
the
things
that
we
ask
for
the
spirit
he
says
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
this
is
conclusive
if
we
do
not
know
what
to
pray
for
nor
how
to
ask
as
we
ought
for
what
is
necessary
for
us
and
if
it
is
needful
that
the
spirit
who
is
in
us
to
whose
motion
we
abandon
ourselves
should
ask
it
for
us
ought
we
not
to
leave
him
to
do
it
he
does
it
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
this
spirit
is
the
spirit
of
the
word
who
is
always
heard
as
he
says
himself
i
know
that
thou
hearest
me
always
john
xi
if
we
leave
it
to
the
spirit
within
us
to
ask
and
to
pray
we
shall
always
be
answered
why
so
o
great
apostle
mystic
teacher
so
deeply
taught
in
the
inner
life
teach
us
why
it
is
he
adds
because
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
spirit
because
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
god
that
is
to
say
this
spirit
only
asks
that
which
it
is
god
will
to
give
it
is
god
will
that
we
should
be
saved
and
that
we
should
be
perfect
he
asks
then
for
all
that
is
necessary
to
our
perfection
why
after
this
should
we
be
burdened
with
superfluous
cares
and
be
wearied
in
the
greatness
of
our
way
without
ever
saying
there
is
no
hope
in
ourselves
and
therefore
resting
in
god
god
himself
invites
us
to
cast
all
our
care
upon
him
and
he
complains
in
inconceivable
goodness
that
we
employ
our
strength
our
riches
and
our
treasure
in
countless
exterior
things
although
there
is
so
little
joy
to
be
found
in
them
all
wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
your
labour
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
hearken
diligently
unto
me
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
fatness
isa
lv
oh
if
it
were
known
what
happiness
there
is
in
thus
hearkening
unto
god
and
how
the
soul
is
strengthened
by
it
all
flesh
must
be
silent
before

ii
all
must
cease
when
he
appears
in
order
still
further
to
induce
us
to
abandon
ourselves
to
him
without
reserve
god
assures
us
that
we
need
fear
nothing
from
such
abandonment
because
he
has
a
special
individual
care
over
each
of
us
he
says

distinction
between
exterior
and
interior
actions
those
of
the
soul
in
this
condition
are
interior
but
habitual
continued
direct
profound
simple
and
imperceptible
being
a
continual
sinking
in
the
ocean
of
divinity
similitude
of
a
vessel
how
to
act
in
the
absence
of
sensible
supports
the
actions
of
men
are
either
exterior
or
interior
the
are
those
which
appear
outwardly
and
have
a
sensible
object
possessing
neither
good
nor
evil
qualities
excepting
as
they
receive
them
from
the
interior
principle
in
which
they
originate
it
is
not
of
these
that
i
intend
to
speak
but
only
of
interior
actions
which
are
those
actions
of
the
soul
by
which
it
inwardly
to
some
object
or
from
some
other
when
being
applied
to
god
i
desire
to
commit
an
action
of
a
different
nature
from
those
which
he
would
prompt
i
turn
away
from
god
and
i
turn
towards
created
things
more
or
less
according
to
the
strength
or
weakness
of
my
action
if
being
turned
towards
the
creature
i
wish
to
return
to
god
i
must
commit
the
action
of
turning
away
from
the
creature
and
turning
towards
god
and
thus
the
more
perfect
is
this
action
the
more
complete
will
be
the
conversion
until
i
am
perfectly
converted
i
need
several
actions
to
turn
me
towards
god
some
are
done
all
at
once
others
gradually
but
my
action
ought
to
lead
me
to
turn
to
god
employing
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
for
him
as
it
is
written
therefore
even
now
saith
the
lord
turn
ye
even
to
me
with
all
your
heart
joel

thou
shalt
return
unto
the
lord

god

all
thine

with

god
only
asks
for
our
heart
my
son
give
me
thy
heart
and
let
thine
eyes
observe
my
ways
prov
xxiii
to
give
the
heart
to
god
is
to
have
its
gaze
its
strength
and
its
vigour
all
centred
in
him
to
follow
his
will
we
must
then
after
we
have
applied
to
god
remain
always
turned
towards
him
but
as
the
mind
of
man
is
weak
and
the
soul
being
accustomed
to
turn
towards
earthly
things
is
easily
turned
away
from
god
it
must
as
soon
as
it
perceives
that
it
is
turned
towards
outward
things
resume
its
former
position
in
god
by
a
simple
act
of
return
to
him
and
as
several
repeated
acts
form
a
habit
the
soul
contracts
a
habit
of
conversion
and
from
action
it
passes
to
a
habitual
condition
the
soul
then
must
not
seek
by
means
of
any
efforts
or
works
of
its
own
to
come
near
to
god
this
is
seeking
to
perform
one
action
by
means
of
others
instead
of
by
a
simple
action
remaining
attached
to
god
alone
if
we
believe
that
we
must
commit
no
actions
we
are
mistaken
for
are
always
but
each
one
must
act
according
to
his
degree
i
will
endeavour
to
make
this
point
clear
as
for
want
of
understanding
it
it
presents
a
difficulty
to
many
christians
there
are
and
actions
and
actions
acts
and
acts
all
can
not
perform
the
first
and
all
are
not
in
a
condition
to
perform
the
others
the
first
actions
should
be
committed
by
those
who
are
turned
away
from
god
they
ought
to
turn
to
him
by
a
distinct
action
more
or
less
strong
according
to
their
distance
from
him
by
a
action
i
understand
that
by
which
the
soul
is
completely
turned
towards
its
god
by
a
action
which
it
does
not
renew
unless
it
has
been
interrupted
but
which
exists
the
soul
being
altogether
turned
in
this
way
is
in
love
and
remains
there
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
god
john
iv
then
the
soul
may
be
said
to
be
in
a
habitual
act
resting
even
in
this
action
but
its
rest
is
not
idle
for
it
has
an
action
in
gentle
sinking
in
in
which
god
attracts
it
more
and
more
strongly
and
following
this
attraction
and
resting
in
love
it
sinks
more
and
more
in
this
love
and
has
an
action
infinitely
stronger
more
vigorous
and
more
prompt
than
that
action
which
forms
only
the
return
now
the
soul
which
is
in
this
and
strong
being
turned
towards
its
god
does
not
perceive
this
action
because
it
is
direct
and
not
reflex
so
that
persons
in
this
condition
not
knowing
how
rightly
to
describe
it
say
that
have
no
but
they
are
mistaken
they
were
never
more
active
it
would
be
better
to
say
they
do
not
distinguish
any
action
than
that
they
do
not
commit
any
the
soul
does
not
act
of
itself
i
admit
but
it
is
drawn
and
it
follows
the
attracting
power
love
is
the
weight
which
sinks
it
as
a
person
who
falls
in
the
sea
sinks
and
would
sink
to
infinity
if
the
sea
were
infinite
and
without
perceiving
its
sinking
it
would
sink
to
the
most
profound
depths
with
an
incredible
speed
it
is
then
incorrect
to
say
that
no
actions
are
committed
all
commit
actions
but
all
do
not
commit
them
in
the
same
manner
and
the
abuse
arises
from
the
fact
that
those
who
know
that
action
is
inevitable
wish
it
to
be
and
but
sensible
action
is
for
beginners
and
the
other
for
those
more
advanced
to
stop
with
the
first
would
be
to
deprive
ourselves
of
the
last
and
to
wish
to
commit
the
last
before
having
passed
the
first
would
be
an
equal
abuse
everything
must
be
done
in
its
season
each
state
has
its
commencement
its
progress
and
its
end
there
is
no
act
which
has
not
its
beginning
at
first
we
must
work
with
but
afterwards
we
enjoy
the
fruit
of
our
labour
when
a
vessel
is
in
the
harbour
the
sailors
have
a
difficulty
in
bringing
it
into
the
open
sea
but
once
there
they
easily
turn
it
in
the
direction
in
which
they
wish
to
navigate
so
when
the
soul
is
in
sin
it
needs
an
effort
to
drag
it
out
the
cords
which
bind
it
must
be
loosened
then
by
means
of
strong
and
vigorous
action
it
must
be
drawn
within
itself
little
by
little
leaving
the
harbour
and
being
turned
within
which
is
the
place
to
which
its
voyage
should
be
directed
when
the
vessel
is
thus
turned
in
proportion
as
it
advances
in
the
sea
it
leaves
the
land
behind
it
and
the
further
it
goes
from
the
land
the
less
effort
is
needed
to
carry
it
along
at
last
it
begins
to
sail
gently
and
the
vessel
goes
on
so
rapidly
that
the
oars
become
useless
what
does
the
pilot
do
then
he
is
contented
with
spreading
the
sails
and
sitting
at
the
helm
the
is
simply
laying
ourselves
before
god
to
be
moved
by
his
spirit
at
the
is
preventing
our
heart
from
leaving
the
right
way
rowing
it
gently
and
leading
it
according
to
the
movement
of
the
spirit
of
god
who
gradually
takes
possession
of
it
as
the
wind
gradually
fills
the
sails
and
impels
the
vessel
forward
so
long
as
the
vessel
sails
before
the
wind
the
mariners
rest
from
their
labour
they
voyage
farther
in
an
hour
while
they
rest
in
this
manner
and
leave
the
ship
to
be
carried
along
by
the
wind
than
they
would
in
a
much
longer
time
by
their
own
efforts
and
if
they
wished
to
row
besides
the
fatigue
which
would
result
from
it
their
labour
would
be
useless
and
would
only
serve
to
retard
the
vessel
this
is
the
conduct
we
should
pursue
in
our
inner
life
and
in
acting
thus
we
shall
advance
more
in
a
short
time
by
the
divine
guidance
than
we
ever
could
do
by
our
own
efforts
if
only
you
will
try
this
way
you
will
find
it
the
easiest
possible
when
the
wind
is
contrary
if
the
wind
and
the
tempest
are
violent
the
anchor
must
be
thrown
in
the
sea
to
stop
the
vessel
this
is
trust
in
god
and
hope
in
his
goodness
waiting
in
patience
for
the
tempest
to
cease
and
for
a
favourable
wind
to
return
as
david
did
i
waited
patiently
for
the
lord
he
says
and
he
inclined
unto
me

the
dryness
of

various
evils
which
arise
from

failing
to
teach
exhortation
to
pastors
to
lead
people
towards
this
form
of
prayer
without
amusing
them
with
studied
and
methodical
devotion
if
all
those
who
are
working
for
the
conquest
of
souls
sought
to
win
them
the
leading
them
first
of
all
to
prayer
and
to
the
inner
life
they
would
see
many
and
lasting
conversions
but
so
long
as
they
only
address
themselves
to
the
outside
and
instead
of
drawing
people
to
christ
by
occupying
their
hearts
with
him
they
only
give
them
a
thousand
precepts
for
outward
observances
they
will
see
but
little
fruit
and
that
will
not
be
lasting
when
once
the
heart
is
won
other
defects
are

is

asks

by
this
means
alone
would
be
prevented

drunkenness
blasphemy
lewdness
enmity
and

which
are

and
the
church
everywhere
would
be
revived

only
takes
possession
of
the
soul
in
the
absence
of
faith
and
prayer
if
men
could
be
taught
to
and
to
instead
of
disputing
amongst
themselves
they
would
be
gently
led
to
christ
oh
how
inestimable
is
the
loss
of
those
who
neglect
the
inner
life
oh
what
an
account
will
they
have
to
render
to
god
who
have
the
charge
of
souls
for
not
having
discovered
this
hidden
treasure
to
all
those
whom
they
serve
in
the
ministry
of
the
word
the
excuse
given
is
that
there
is
in
this
way
or
that
ignorant
people
are
incapable
of
spiritual
things
the
oracle
of
truth
assures
us
that
god
has
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
has
revealed
them
to
babes
and
what
danger
can
there
be
in
walking
in
the
only
true
way
which
is
jesus
christ
in
giving
ourselves
to
him
looking
to
him
continually
putting
all
our
trust
in
his
grace
and
tending
with
all
the
forces
of
our
souls
to
his
pure
love
far
from
the
simple
ones
being
of
this
perfection
they
are
the
most
suitable
for
it
because
they
are
more
docile
more
humble
and
more
innocent
and
as
they
do
not
reason
they
are
not

to

the

others
who
are

in
their

resist

jesus
only
said
this
to
his

because
they
wished
to
keep
the
children
away
from
him
often
the
remedy
is
applied
to
the
body
when
the
disease
is
at
the
the
reason
why
we
have
so
little
success
in
seeking
to
reform
men
is
that
we
direct
our
efforts
to
the
outside
and
all
that
we
can
do
there
soon
passes
off
but
if
we
were
to
give
them
first
key
of
the
the
outside
would
be
reformed
at
once
with
a
natural
facility
and
this
is
very
easy
to
teach
them
to
seek
god
in
their
heart
to
think
of
him
to
return
to
him
when
they
find
they
have
turned
away
to
do
all
and
suffer
all
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
him
this
is
to
direct
them
to
the
source
of
all
grace
and
to
make
them
find
there
all
that
is
necessary
for
their
sanctification
o
you
who
serve
souls
i
conjure
you
to
put
them
first
of
all
into
this
way
which
is
jesus

it
is

who
conjures
you
to
do
this

shed

as
it

alone
which
can
oppose
his
empire
it
is
by
the
subjection
of
the
heart
that
his
sovereignty
is
most
honoured
alas
we
seek
to
make
prayers
and
by
wishing
to
arrange
them
too
much
we
render
them
impossible
we
have
alienated
children
from
the
best
of
fathers
in
seeking
to
teach
them
a
polished
language
go
poor
children
and
speak
to
your
heavenly
father
in
your
natural
language
however
uncultivated
it
may
be
it
is
not
so
to
him
a
father
loves
best
the
speech
which
is
put
in
disorder
by
love
and
respect
because
he
sees
that
it
comes
from
the
heart
it
is
more
to
him
than
a
dry
harangue
vain
and
unfruitful
though
well
studied
oh
how
certain
glances
of
love
charm
and
ravish
him
they
express
infinitely
more
than
all
language
and
reason
by
wishing
to
teach
how
to
love
love
himself
with
method
much
of
this
love
has
been
lost
oh
it
is
not
necessary
to
teach
the
art
of
loving
the
language
of
love
is
barbarous
to
him
who
does
not
love
and
we
can
not
learn
to
love
god
better
than
by
loving
him
the
spirit
of
god
does
not
need
our
arrangements
he
takes
shepherds
at
his
pleasure
to
make
them
prophets
and
far
from
closing
the
palace
of
prayer
to
any
as
it
is
imagined
he
leaves
the
doors
open
to
all
and

chapter
xix
after
the
preceding
ways
there
remains
an
after
way
preparatory
to
divine
union
in
which
wisdom
and
justice
make
the
passive
purification
of
the
soul
all
which
is
treated
in
detail
in
the
following
treatise
entitled
spiritual
torrents
it
is
impossible
to
attain
divine
union
by
the
way
of
meditation
alone
or
even
by
the
affections
or
by
any
luminous
or
understood
prayer
there
are
several
reasons
these
are
the
principal
first
according
to
scripture
no
man
shall
see
god
and
live
exod
xxxiii
now
all
discursive
exercises
of
prayer
or
even
of
regarded
as
an
end
and
not
as
a
preparation
for
the
are
exercises
of
life
by
which
we
can
not
see
god
that
is
become
united
to
him
all
that
is
of
man
and
of
his
own
industry
however
noble
and
elevated
it
may
be
must
die
st
john
tells
us
that
there
was
silence
in
heaven
heaven
represents
the
depths
and
centre
of
the
soul
where
all
must
be
in
silence
when
the
majesty
of
god
appears
all
that
belongs
to
our
own
efforts
or
to
ourselves
in
any
way
must
be
destroyed
because
nothing
is
opposed
to
god
but
appropriation
and
all
the
malignity
of
man
is
in
this
appropriation
which
is
the
source
of
his
evil
so
that
the
more
a
soul
loses
its
appropriation
the
more
it
becomes
pure
secondly
in
order
to
unite
two
things
so
opposed
as
the
purity
of
god
and
the
impurity
of
the
creature
the
simplicity
of
god
and
the
multiplicity
of
the
creature
god
must
operate
alone
for
this
can
never
be
done
by
the
effort
of
the
creature
since
two
things
can
not
be
united
unless
there
is
some
relation
or
resemblance
between
them
as
an
impure
metal
would
never
unite
with
one
that
was
pure
and
refined
what
does
god
do
then
he
sends
before
him
his
own
wisdom
as
fire
will
be
sent
upon
the
earth
to
consume
by
its
activity
all
the
impurity
that
is
there
fire
consumes
all
things
and
nothing
resists
its
activity
it
is
the
same
with
wisdom
it
consumes
all
impurity
in
the
creature
to
prepare
him
for
divine
union
this
impurity
so
opposed
to
union
is
appropriation
and
activity
because
it
is
the
source
of
the
real
impurity
which
can
never
be
united
to
essential
purity
as
the
sun
rays
may
touch
the
mud
but
can
not
unite
with
it
because
god
being
in
an
infinite
repose
in
order
that
the
soul
may
be
united
to
him
it
must
participate
in
his
repose
without
which
there
can
be
no
union
because
of
the
dissemblance
and
to
unite
two
things
they
must
be
in
a
proportionate
rest
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
soul
can
only
attain
divine
union
by
the
rest
of
its
will
and
it
can
only
be
united
to
god
when
it
is
in
a
and
in
the
purity
of
its
creation
to
purify
the
soul
god
makes
use
of
wisdom
as
fire
is
used
for
the
purification
of
gold
it
is
certain
that
gold
can
only
be
purified
by
fire
which
gradually
consumes
all
that
is
earthly
and
foreign
and
separates
it
from
the
gold
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
earth
should
be
changed
into
gold
it
is
necessary
that
the
fire
should
melt
and
dissolve
it
to
remove
from
it
all
that
is
earthly
and
this
gold
is
put
in
the
fire
so
many
times
that
it
loses
its
impurity
and
all
necessity
of
purification
then
it
is
fit
to
be
employed
in
the
most
excellent
workmanship
and
if
this
gold
is
impure
in
the
end
it
is
because
it
has
contracted
fresh
defilement
by
coming
in
contact
with
other
bodies
but
this
impurity
is
only
superficial
and
does
not
prevent
its
being
used
whereas
its
former
impurity
was
hidden
within
it
and
as
it
were
identified
with
its
nature
in
addition
to
this
you
will
remark
that
gold
of
an
inferior
degree
of
purity
can
not
mix
with
that
of
a
superior
purity
the
one
must
contract
the
impurity
of
the
other
or
else
impart
its
own
purity
to
it
put
a
refined
gold
with
an
unrefined
one
what
can
the
goldsmith
ever
do
with
it
he
will
have
all
the
impurity
taken
from
the
second
piece
that
it
may
be
able
to
mix
with
the
first
this
is
what
st
paul
tells
us
that
the
fire
shall
try
every
man
work
of
what
sort
it
is
he
adds
that
if
any
man
work
should
be
found
to
deserve
burning
he
should
be
saved
so
as
by
fire
cor
iii
that
means
that
though
there
are
some
works
which
are
good
and
which
god
receives
yet
so
that
he
who
has
done
them
may
be
pure
they
too
must
pass
through
the
fire
in
order
that
all
appropriation
that
is
all
that
was
his
own
may
be
taken
from
them
god
will
judge
our
righteousness
because
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
but
by
the
righteousness
of
god
which
is
by
faith
rom
iii
this
being
understood
i
say
that
in
order
that
man
may
be
united
to
his
god
wisdom
and
divine
justice
like
a
pitiless
and
devouring
fire
must
take
from
him
all
appropriation
all
that
is
terrestrial
carnal
and
of
his
own
activity
and
having
taken
all
this
from
him
they
must
unite
him
to
god
this
is
never
brought
about
by
the
labours
of
the
creature
on
the
contrary
it
even
causes
him
regret
because
as
i
have
said
man
so
loves
what
is
his
own
and
is
so
fearful
of
its
destruction
that
if
god
did
not
accomplish
it
himself
and
by
his
own
authority
man
would
never
consent
to
it
it
will
be
objected
to
this
that
god
never
deprives
man
of
his
liberty
and
that
therefore
he
can
always
resist
god
for
which
reason
i
ought
not
to
say
that
acts
absolutely
without
the
consent
of
in
explanation
i
say
that
it
is
sufficient
that
man
should
give
a
that
he
may
have
entire
and
full
liberty
because
having
at
the
beginning
given
himself
to
god
that
he
may
do
as
he
will
both
with
him
and
in
him
he
gave
from
that
time
an
and
general
assent
to
all
that
god
might
do
but
when
god
destroys
burns
and
purifies
the
soul
does
not
see
that
all
this
is
for
its
advantage
it
rather
believes
the
contrary
and
as
at
first
the
fire
seems
to
tarnish
the
gold
so
this
operation
seems
to
despoil
the
soul
of
its
purity
so
that
if
an
and
consent
were
required
the
soul
would
find
a
difficulty
in
giving
it
and
often
would
not
give
it
all
that
it
does
is
to
remain
in
a
passive
contentment
enduring
this
operation
as
well
as
it
can
being
neither
able
nor
willing
to
prevent
it
god
then
so
purifies
this
soul
of
all
natural
distinct
and
perceived
operations
that
at
last
he
makes
it
more
and
more
to
himself
and
then
raising
the
passive
capacity
of
the
creature
enlarging
it
and
ennobling
it
though
in
a
hidden
and
unperceived
manner
which
is
termed
mystical
but
in
all
these
operations
the
soul
must
concur
passively
and
in
proportion
as
the
working
of
god
becomes
stronger
the
soul
must
continually
yield
to
him
until
he
absorbs
it
altogether
we
do
not
say
then
as
some
assert
that
there
must
be
no
since
on
the
contrary
this
is
but
only
that
must
not
remain
in
seeing
that
man
should
tend
towards
the
perfection
of
his
end
and
that
he
can
never
reach
it
without
quitting
the
first
means
which
though
they
were
necessary
to
introduce
him
into
the
way
would
greatly
hinder
him
afterwards
if
he
attached
himself
obstinately
to
them
this
is
what
paul
said
i
forget
those
things
which
are
behind
and
reach
forth
unto
those
things
which
are
before
i
press
toward
the
mark
phil
iii
should
we
not
consider
a
person
destitute
of
reason
who
after
undertaking
a
journey
stopped
at
the
first
inn
because
he
was
assured
that
several
had
passed
it
that
a
few
had
lodged
there
and
that
the
landlord
lived
there
what
the
soul
is
required
to
do
then
is
advance
towards
its
to
take
the
shortest
road
not
to
stop
at
the
first
point
and
following
the
advice
of
st
paul
to
suffer
itself
to
be
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
rom
viii
who
will
lead
it
to
the
end
for
which
it
was
created
which
is
the
enjoyment
of
god
it
is
well
known
that
the
sovereign
good
is
god
that
essential
blessedness
consists
in
union
with
god
and
that
this
union
can
not
be
the
result
of
our
own
efforts
since
god
only
communicates
himself
to
the
soul
according
to
its
capacity
we
can
not
be
united
to
god
without
passivity
and
simplicity
and
this
union
being
bliss
the
way
which
leads
to
it
must
be
the
best
and
there
can
be
no
risk
in
walking
in
it
this
way
is
not
if
it
were
christ
would
not
have
represented
it
as
the
most
perfect
and
necessary
of
all
ways
all
can
walk
in
it
and
as
all
are
called
to
blessedness
all
are
called
to
the
enjoyment
of
god
both
in
this
life
and
in
that
which
is
to
come
since
the
enjoyment
of
god
is
blessedness
i
say
the
enjoyment
of
god
himself
not
of
his
gifts
which
can
never
impart
essential
blessedness
not
being
able
fully
to
satisfy
the
soul
which
is
so
constituted
that
even
the
richest
gifts
of
god
can
not
thoroughly
content
it
the
desire
of
god
is
to
give
himself
to
us
according
to
the
capacity
with
which
he
has
endowed
us
and
yet
we
fear
to
leave
ourselves
to
god
we
fear
to
possess
him
and
to
be
prepared
for
divine
union
you
say
must
not
bring
ourselves
to
this
i
agree
to
that
but
i
say
too
that
no
one
ever
could
bring
himself
to
it
since
no
man
could
ever
unite
himself
to
god
by
his
own
efforts
and
god
himself
must
do
the
work
you
say
that
some
pretend
to
have
attained
it
i
say
that
this
state
can
not
be
feigned
any
more
than
a
man
dying
of
hunger
can
for
any
length
of
time
pretend
to
be
satisfied
it
will
soon
be
known
whether
or
no
men
have
attained
this
end
since
then
none
can
arrive
at
the
end
unless
he
be
brought
there
it
is
not
a
question
of
introducing
people
to
it
but
of
showing
them
the
way
which
leads
to
it
and
begging
them
not
to
rest
in
those
practices
which
must
be
relinquished
at
god
command
would
it
not
be
cruelty
to
show
a
fountain
to
a
thirsty
man
and
then
hold
him
bound
and
prevent
his
going
to
it
leaving
him
to
die
of
thirst
that
is
what
is
being
done
now
let
us
all
be
agreed
both
as
to
the
way
and
the
end
the
way
has
its
commencement
its
progress
and
its
terminus
the
more
we
advance
towards
the
terminus
the
farther
we
go
from
the
commencement
and
it
is
impossible
to
reach
the
terminus
but
by
constantly
going
farther
from
the
being
unable
to
go
from
one
place
to
another
without
passing
through
all
that
comes
between
them
this
is
incontestable
oh
how
blind
are
the
majority
of
men
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
learning
and
talent
o
lord
how
true
it
is
that
thou
hast
hidden
thy
secrets
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
