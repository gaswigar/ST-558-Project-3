introduction
my
publisher
wants
me
to
apologize
for
introduce
was
the
kindly
word
he
used
this
collection
of
articles
and
verses
from
i
do
so
with
pleasure
the
many
interests
of
a
long
and
varied
no
i
do
think
i
shall
begin
like
that
was
early
in
nor
like
that
really
it
is
very
difficult
you
know
i
wrote
these
things
for
a
number
of
years
and
well
here
they
are
but
just
to
say
here
they
are
is
to
be
too
informal
for
my
publisher
he
wants
not
a
casual
introduction
but
a
presentation
let
me
tell
you
a
little
story
instead
when
war
broke
out
i
had
published
three
of
these
books
in
england
the
gleanings
of
nine
years
regular
work
for
there
are
i
understand
a
few
americans
who
read
and
it
was
suggested
to
me
that
a
suitable
collection
of
articles
from
these
three
books
might
have
some
sort
of
american
sale
so
i
made
such
a
collection
leaving
out
the
more
topical
and
allusive
sketches
and
including
those
with
a
more
general
appeal
i
called
the
result
happy
days
an
attractive
title
you
will
agree
and
in
a
new
york
publisher
was
found
for
it
this
is
a
funny
story
at
least
it
appeals
to
so
i
wo
remind
myself
of
the
number
of
copies
which
we
sold
that
was
tragedy
not
comedy
the
joke
lay
in
one
of
the
few
notices
which
the
book
received
from
the
press
for
a
new
york
critic
ended
his
review
of
happy
days
with
these
immortal
words
milne
is
at
present
in
the
trenches
facing
the
german
bullets
so
this
will
probably
be
his
last
you
see
now
why
an
apology
is
necessary
here
we
are
seven
years
later
and
i
am
still
at
it
but
at
any
rate
it
is
the
last
of
this
sort
of
book
as
i
said
in
a
foreword
to
the
english
edition
it
is
the
last
time
because
this
sort
of
writing
depends
largely
upon
the
irresponsibility
and
high
spirits
of
youth
for
its
success
and
i
want
to
stop
before
may
i
say
the
high
spirits
become
mechanical
and
the
irresponsibility
a
trick
perhaps
the
fact
that
this
collection
is
final
will
excuse
its
air
of
scrappiness
odd
verses
have
crept
in
on
the
unanswerable
plea
that
if
they
did
do
it
now
they
never
would
war
sketches
protested
that
i
should
have
a
book
at
all
if
i
left
them
out
an
early
article
omitted
from
three
previous
volumes
paraded
for
the
fourth
time
with
such
a
pathetic
suppose
you
do
want
in
its
eye
that
it
could
not
decently
be
rejected
so
here
they
all
are
one
further
word
of
explanation
you
may
find
the
first
section
of
this
book
oranges
and
lemons
a
little
difficult
the
characters
of
it
are
old
friends
to
that
limited
public
which
reads
my
books
in
england
their
earlier
adventures
have
been
told
in
those
previous
volumes
and
purposely
omitted
from
happy
days
as
being
a
little
too
insular
i
feel
somehow
that
strangers
will
not
be
on
such
easy
terms
with
them
and
i
would
recommend
that
you
approach
them
last
by
that
time
you
will
have
discovered
whether
you
are
in
a
mood
to
stop
and
listen
to
their
chatter
or
prefer
to
pass
them
by
with
a
nod
the
sunny
side
oranges
and
lemons
i
the
invitation
dear
myra
wrote
simpson
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
have
an
important
suggestion
to
make
to
you
both
and
i
am
coming
round
night
after
dinner
about
nine
as
time
is
so
short
i
have
asked
dahlia
and
archie
to
meet
me
there
and
if
by
any
chance
you
have
gone
out
we
shall
wait
till
you
come
back
yours
ever
samuel
i
have
asked
thomas
too
well
said
myra
eagerly
as
i
gave
her
back
the
letter
in
deep
thought
i
buttered
a
piece
of
toast
we
could
stop
thomas
i
said
we
might
ring
up
the
admiralty
and
ask
them
to
give
him
something
to
do
this
evening
i
do
know
about
archie
is
he
oh
what
do
you
think
it
is
are
you
excited
she
sighed
and
added
of
course
i
know
what
samuel
yes
probably
he
wants
us
all
to
go
to
the
zoo
together
or
discovered
a
new
way
of
putting
or
i
say
i
did
know
archie
and
dahlia
were
in
town
they
are
but
i
expect
samuel
telegraphed
to
them
to
meet
him
under
the
clock
at
charing
cross
disguised
when
they
would
hear
of
something
to
their
advantage
oh
i
wonder
what
it
is
it
be
something
real
this
time
since
the
day
when
simpson
woke
me
up
at
six
in
the
morning
to
show
me
his
shot
i
have
distrusted
his
enthusiasms
but
myra
loves
him
as
a
mother
and
i
i
could
do
without
him
and
when
a
man
like
that
invites
a
whole
crowd
of
people
to
come
to
your
flat
just
about
the
time
when
you
are
wondering
what
has
happened
to
the
sardines
on
toast
well
it
is
polite
to
put
the
chain
on
the
door
and
explain
through
the
that
you
have
gone
away
for
a
week
we
better
have
dinner
a
bit
earlier
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
said
as
myra
gave
me
a
parting
brush
down
in
the
hall
if
any
further
developments
occur
in
the
course
of
the
day
ring
me
up
at
the
office
by
the
way
simpson
does
seem
to
have
invited
peter
i
wonder
why
not
he
nearly
two
and
he
ought
to
be
in
it
myra
i
sure
i
tidy
now
pipe
tobacco
matches
keys
money
everything
i
said
bless
you
goodbye
said
myra
lingeringly
what
do
you
think
he
meant
by
time
is
so
short
i
do
know
at
least
i
added
looking
at
my
watch
i
do
know
i
shall
be
horribly
late
i
fled
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
waved
to
myra
at
the
window
and
then
came
cautiously
up
again
for
my
pipe
life
is
very
difficult
on
the
mornings
when
you
are
in
a
hurry
at
dinner
that
night
myra
could
hardly
eat
for
excitement
you
be
sorry
afterwards
i
warned
her
when
it
turns
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
that
he
has
had
his
hair
cut
but
even
if
it
is
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
excited
at
seeing
my
only
brother
again
not
to
mention
then
let
move
i
said
they
be
here
directly
archie
and
dahlia
came
first
we
besieged
them
with
questions
as
soon
as
they
appeared
have
an
idea
said
archie
i
wanted
to
bring
a
revolver
in
case
it
was
anything
really
desperate
but
dahlia
would
let
me
it
would
have
been
useful
too
i
said
if
it
turned
out
to
be
something
merely
futile
you
not
going
to
hurt
my
samuel
however
futile
it
is
said
myra
dahlia
how
peter
and
will
you
have
some
coffee
peter
lovely
you
had
coffee
have
you
archie
better
have
some
more
i
suggested
in
case
simpson
is
merely
soporific
we
anticipate
a
slumbering
audience
and
samuel
explaining
a
new
kind
of
googlie
he
invented
entered
thomas
lazily
hallo
he
said
in
his
slow
voice
what
it
all
about
it
a
raid
on
the
begum
palace
explained
archie
rapidly
dahlia
decoys
the
chief
mucilage
you
thomas
drive
the
submarine
myra
has
charge
of
the
clockwork
mouse
and
we
others
hang
about
and
sing
to
say
more
at
this
stage
would
be
to
bring
about
a
european
conflict
coffee
thomas
said
myra
i
bet
he
having
us
on
said
thomas
gloomily
as
he
stirred
his
coffee
there
was
a
hurricane
in
the
hall
chairs
were
swept
over
coats
and
hats
fell
to
the
ground
a
high
voice
offered
continuous
apologies
and
simpson
came
in
hallo
myra
he
said
eagerly
hallo
old
chap
hallo
dahlia
hallo
archie
hallo
thomas
old
boy
he
fixed
his
spectacles
firmly
on
his
nose
and
beamed
round
the
room
we
all
here
thanking
you
very
much
for
inviting
us
i
said
have
a
cigar
if
you
brought
any
with
you
fortunately
he
had
brought
several
with
him
now
then
i
give
any
of
you
three
guesses
what
it
all
about
no
you
do
we
all
waiting
and
you
can
begin
your
apology
right
away
simpson
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
i
been
lent
a
villa
he
said
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
archie
got
up
he
said
to
myra
holding
out
his
hand
thanks
for
a
very
jolly
evening
come
along
dahlia
but
i
say
old
chap
protested
simpson
i
sorry
simpson
but
the
fact
that
you
moving
from
the
temple
to
cricklewood
or
wherever
it
is
and
that
somebody
else
is
paying
the
thirty
pounds
a
year
is
jolly
interesting
but
it
was
good
enough
to
drag
us
up
from
the
country
to
tell
us
about
it
you
could
have
written
however
thank
you
for
the
cigar
my
dear
fellow
it
is
cricklewood
it
the
riviera
archie
sat
down
again
samuel
cried
myra
how
she
must
love
you
i
should
never
lend
simpson
a
villa
of
mine
i
said
he
only
lose
it
they
some
very
old
friends
who
live
there
and
they
going
away
for
a
month
and
the
servants
are
staying
on
and
they
suggested
that
if
i
was
going
abroad
again
this
year
how
did
the
servants
know
you
been
abroad
last
year
asked
archie
do
interrupt
dear
said
dahlia
i
see
what
he
means
how
very
jolly
for
you
samuel
for
all
of
us
dahlia
you
are
suggesting
we
shall
all
crowd
in
growled
thomas
of
course
my
dear
old
chap
i
told
them
and
they
delighted
we
can
share
housekeeping
expenses
and
it
will
be
as
cheap
as
anything
but
to
go
into
a
stranger
house
said
dahlia
anxiously
it
house
dahlia
for
the
time
i
invite
you
he
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
large
gesture
of
welcome
and
knocked
his
on
to
the
carpet
begged
myra
pardon
several
times
and
then
sat
down
again
and
wiped
his
spectacles
vigorously
archie
looked
doubtfully
at
thomas
duty
thomas
duty
he
said
thumping
his
chest
you
ca
desert
the
navy
at
this
moment
of
crisis
might
said
thomas
puffing
at
his
pipe
archie
looked
at
me
i
looked
hopefully
at
myra
said
myra
entranced
archie
looked
at
dahlia
dahlia
frowned
it
is
till
february
said
simpson
eagerly
it
very
kind
of
you
samuel
said
dahlia
but
i
do
think
archie
nodded
to
simpson
you
leave
this
to
me
he
said
confidentially
we
going
ii
on
the
way
toulon
announced
archie
as
the
train
came
to
a
stop
and
gave
out
its
plaintive
dying
whistle
naval
port
of
our
dear
allies
the
french
this
would
interest
thomas
if
he
were
asleep
i
said
he
be
here
directly
said
simpson
from
the
little
table
for
two
on
the
other
side
of
the
gangway
i
afraid
he
had
a
bad
night
here
er
du
café
but
the
waiter
had
slipped
past
him
again
the
fifth
time
have
some
of
ours
said
myra
kindly
holding
out
the
pot
thanks
very
much
myra
but
i
may
as
well
wait
for
thomas
and
du
café
i
do
think
he
be
cafés
garçon
it
going
to
be
a
lovely
day
thomas
came
in
quietly
sat
down
opposite
simpson
and
ordered
breakfast
samuel
wants
some
too
said
myra
thomas
looked
surprised
grunted
and
ordered
another
breakfast
you
see
how
easy
it
is
said
archie
thomas
we
at
toulon
where
the
come
from
you
ought
to
have
been
up
long
ago
taking
notes
for
the
admiralty
i
had
a
rotten
night
said
thomas
simpson
fell
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
it
oh
poor
samuel
you
do
mean
to
say
you
gave
him
the
top
berth
i
asked
in
surprise
you
must
have
known
he
fall
out
but
thomas
dear
surely
samuel
just
noise
wake
you
up
said
myra
i
always
thought
you
slept
so
well
he
tried
to
get
back
into
bed
i
was
a
little
dazed
explained
simpson
hastily
and
i
had
got
my
spectacles
still
you
ought
to
have
been
able
to
see
thomas
there
of
course
i
did
see
him
as
soon
as
i
got
in
and
then
i
remembered
i
was
up
above
so
i
climbed
up
it
must
be
rather
difficult
climbing
up
at
night
thought
dahlia
not
if
you
get
a
good
dahlia
said
simpson
earnestly
simpson
got
a
good
one
off
my
face
explained
thomas
my
dear
old
chap
i
was
frightfully
sorry
i
did
come
down
at
once
and
tell
you
how
sorry
i
was
did
i
you
stepped
back
on
to
it
said
thomas
shortly
and
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
coffee
our
table
had
finished
breakfast
dahlia
and
myra
got
up
slowly
and
archie
and
i
filled
our
pipes
and
followed
them
out
well
we
leave
you
to
it
said
archie
to
the
other
table
personally
i
think
it
thomas
turn
to
step
on
simpson
but
do
be
long
because
there
a
good
view
coming
the
good
view
came
and
then
another
and
another
and
they
merged
together
and
became
one
long
moving
panorama
of
beauty
we
stood
in
the
corridor
and
drank
it
in
and
at
intervals
we
said
and
oh
i
say
and
oh
i
say
and
there
was
one
particular
spot
i
wish
i
could
remember
where
so
that
it
might
be
marked
by
a
suitable
tablet
at
the
sight
of
which
simpson
was
overheard
to
say
for
probably
the
first
time
in
his
life
you
know
all
these
are
olive
trees
you
chaps
he
said
every
five
minutes
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
olives
growing
on
them
too
early
said
archie
it
the
sardine
season
now
it
was
at
cannes
that
we
saw
the
first
oranges
that
does
it
i
said
to
myra
we
really
here
and
look
there
a
lemon
tree
give
me
the
oranges
and
lemons
and
you
can
have
all
the
palms
and
the
cactuses
and
the
olives
like
polar
bears
in
the
arctic
regions
said
myra
i
thought
for
a
moment
superficially
there
is
very
little
resemblance
between
an
orange
and
a
polar
bear
like
polar
bears
i
said
hopefully
i
mean
luckily
she
went
on
polar
bears
do
it
for
you
in
the
polar
regions
you
really
know
you
there
then
give
me
the
polar
bears
i
always
say
and
you
can
keep
the
seals
and
the
walruses
and
the
penguins
it
the
hallmark
right
i
knew
you
meant
something
in
london
i
went
on
it
is
raining
looking
out
of
my
window
i
see
a
not
in
flower
beneath
a
low
grey
sky
here
we
see
oranges
against
a
blue
sky
a
million
miles
deep
what
a
blend
myra
let
go
to
a
ball
when
we
get
back
you
go
as
an
orange
and
i
go
as
a
very
blue
blue
sky
and
you
shall
lean
against
me
and
we
dance
the
tangerine
said
myra
but
now
observe
us
approaching
monte
carlo
for
an
hour
past
simpson
has
been
collecting
his
belongings
two
bags
two
coats
a
camera
a
rug
thomas
books
his
compartment
is
full
of
things
which
have
to
be
kept
under
his
eye
lest
they
should
evade
him
at
the
last
moment
as
the
train
leaves
monaco
his
excitement
is
intense
i
think
old
chap
he
says
to
thomas
i
wear
the
coats
after
all
and
the
bags
says
thomas
and
then
you
have
a
suit
simpson
puts
on
the
two
coats
and
appears
very
big
and
hot
i
better
have
my
hands
free
he
says
and
straps
the
camera
and
the
on
to
himself
then
if
you
nip
out
and
get
a
porter
i
can
hand
the
bags
out
to
him
through
the
window
all
right
says
thomas
he
is
deep
in
his
book
and
looks
as
if
he
were
settled
in
his
corner
of
the
carriage
for
the
day
the
train
stops
there
is
bustle
noise
confusion
thomas
in
some
magical
way
has
disappeared
a
porter
appears
at
the
open
window
and
speaks
voluble
french
to
simpson
simpson
looks
round
wildly
for
thomas
thomas
he
cries
he
says
to
the
porter
thomas
ami
it
i
say
thomas
old
chap
where
are
you
un
moment
mon
er
he
is
very
hot
he
is
wearing
in
addition
to
what
one
does
mention
an
ordinary
waistcoat
a
woolly
waistcoat
for
steamer
use
a
tweed
coat
an
aquascutum
an
ulster
a
camera
and
a
bag
of
golfclubs
the
porter
with
many
gesticulations
is
still
hurling
french
at
him
it
is
too
much
for
simpson
he
puts
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
observing
in
the
distance
a
figure
of
such
immense
dignity
that
it
can
only
belong
to
the
utters
to
him
across
the
a
wild
call
for
help
cooks
he
cries
iii
settling
down
the
villa
was
high
up
on
the
hill
having
as
simpson
was
to
point
out
several
times
later
mentone
on
its
left
hand
and
monte
carlo
on
its
right
a
long
winding
path
led
up
through
its
garden
of
olives
to
the
front
door
and
through
the
mimosa
trees
which
flanked
this
door
we
could
see
already
a
flutter
of
white
aprons
the
staff
was
on
the
loggia
waiting
to
greet
us
we
halted
a
moment
out
of
sight
of
the
ladies
above
and
considered
ourselves
it
came
to
us
with
a
sudden
shock
that
we
were
a
very
large
party
i
suppose
said
archie
to
simpson
they
do
expect
all
of
us
and
not
only
you
you
told
them
that
about
half
london
was
coming
we
only
six
said
myra
because
i
just
counted
again
but
we
seem
about
twenty
it
quite
all
right
said
simpson
cheerfully
i
said
we
be
six
but
six
in
a
letter
is
much
smaller
than
six
of
us
like
this
and
when
they
see
our
luggage
let
go
back
i
suggested
suddenly
nervous
to
be
five
guests
of
the
guest
of
a
man
you
have
never
met
is
delicate
work
at
this
critical
moment
archie
assumed
command
he
is
a
captain
in
the
yeomanry
and
has
tackled
bigger
jobs
than
this
in
his
time
we
must
get
ourselves
into
proper
order
he
said
simpson
the
villa
has
been
lent
to
you
must
go
first
dahlia
and
i
come
next
when
we
arrive
you
will
introduce
us
as
your
friends
and
mannering
then
turning
to
myra
you
say
mannering
sister
and
this
you
add
her
husband
then
er
thomas
it
will
be
difficult
to
account
for
thomas
i
said
thomas
comes
at
the
end
he
hangs
back
a
little
at
first
and
then
if
he
sees
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
awkwardness
about
him
he
can
pretend
he
come
on
the
wrong
night
and
apologize
and
go
home
again
if
thomas
goes
i
go
said
myra
dramatically
i
have
another
idea
i
said
thomas
hides
here
for
a
bit
we
introduce
ourselves
and
settle
in
and
have
lunch
and
after
lunch
we
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
and
to
our
great
surprise
discover
thomas
we
say
here
dear
old
chap
we
thought
you
were
in
england
how
splendid
where
are
you
staying
oh
but
you
must
stop
with
we
can
easily
have
a
bed
put
up
for
you
in
the
garage
and
then
not
after
lunch
said
thomas
before
lunch
do
all
be
so
silly
smiled
dahlia
they
wonder
what
has
happened
to
us
if
we
wait
any
longer
besides
the
men
will
be
here
with
the
luggage
directly
come
along
samuel
said
archie
forward
in
our
new
formation
we
marched
up
simpson
excited
and
rehearsing
to
himself
the
words
of
introduction
we
others
outwardly
calm
at
a
range
of
ten
yards
he
opened
fire
how
do
you
do
he
beamed
here
we
all
are
is
it
a
lovely
the
majestic
but
kindly
came
forward
with
outstretched
hand
and
welcomed
him
volubly
in
french
the
other
three
ladies
added
their
french
to
hers
there
was
only
one
english
body
on
the
loggia
it
belonged
to
a
the
barked
loudly
at
simpson
in
english
there
was
no
cook
homme
to
save
simpson
this
time
but
he
rose
to
the
occasion
nobly
the
scent
of
the
mimosa
inspired
him
he
said
oui
ce
delightful
er
these
are
sont
mes
er
dahlia
come
along
er
et
madame
er
myra
soeur
de
er
where
are
you
old
chap
mari
de
la
soeur
de
er
thomas
er
he
was
carried
away
by
memories
of
his
schoolboy
french
frère
du
er
he
wheeled
round
and
saw
me
introduced
me
again
introduced
myra
as
my
wife
archie
as
her
brother
and
dahlia
as
wife
and
then
with
a
sudden
inspiration
presented
thomas
grandly
as
du
petit
fils
de
mes
amis
monsieur
et
madame
thomas
seemed
more
assured
of
his
place
as
peter
godfather
than
as
the
brother
of
the
gardener
there
were
four
ladies
we
shook
hands
with
all
of
them
it
took
us
a
long
time
and
i
doubt
if
we
got
it
all
in
even
so
for
twice
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
with
simpson
but
these
may
have
been
additional
ones
thrown
in
it
was
over
at
last
and
we
followed
the
staff
indoors
and
then
we
had
another
surprise
it
was
broken
to
us
by
dahlia
who
at
simpson
urgent
request
took
up
the
position
of
lady
of
the
house
and
forthwith
received
the
flowing
confidences
of
the
housekeeper
two
of
us
have
to
sleep
outside
she
said
where
we
all
asked
blankly
we
went
on
to
the
loggia
again
and
she
pointed
to
a
little
house
almost
hidden
by
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
below
us
oh
well
that
all
right
said
archie
it
on
the
estate
thomas
you
and
simpson
wo
mind
that
a
bit
will
you
we
ca
turn
samuel
out
of
his
own
house
said
myra
indignantly
we
are
turning
him
he
wants
to
go
but
of
course
if
you
and
your
young
man
would
like
to
live
there
instead
myra
looked
at
me
eagerly
it
would
be
rather
fun
she
said
we
have
another
little
honeymoon
all
to
ourselves
it
would
really
be
a
honeymoon
i
objected
we
should
always
be
knocking
up
against
trippers
in
the
garden
archies
and
samuels
and
thomases
and
what
not
they
be
all
over
the
place
dahlia
explained
the
domestic
arrangements
the
honeymooners
had
their
little
breakfast
in
their
own
little
house
and
then
joined
the
others
for
the
day
at
about
ten
or
eleven
said
thomas
it
would
be
rather
lovely
said
myra
thoughtfully
yes
i
agreed
but
have
you
considered
that
come
over
this
way
a
moment
where
thomas
and
simpson
ca
hear
while
i
tell
you
some
of
the
disadvantages
i
led
her
into
a
quiet
corner
and
suggested
a
few
things
to
her
which
i
hoped
would
not
occur
to
the
other
two
that
if
it
was
raining
hard
at
night
it
would
be
beastly
that
if
you
suddenly
found
you
left
your
pipe
behind
it
would
be
rotten
that
if
as
was
probable
there
was
a
proper
bathroom
in
the
little
house
it
would
be
sickening
that
if
she
had
to
walk
on
muddy
paths
in
her
evening
shoes
it
would
be
at
this
point
myra
suddenly
caught
the
thread
of
the
argument
we
went
back
to
the
others
we
think
said
myra
it
would
be
perfectly
heavenly
in
the
little
house
but
she
hesitated
but
at
the
same
time
i
said
we
think
it
up
to
simpson
and
thomas
to
be
english
gentlemen
samuel
it
your
honour
there
was
a
moment
silence
come
along
said
thomas
to
simpson
let
go
and
look
at
it
after
lunch
clean
and
and
happy
we
lay
in
on
the
loggia
and
looked
lazily
down
at
the
mediterranean
thank
you
samuel
for
bringing
us
said
dahlia
gently
your
friends
must
be
very
fond
of
you
to
have
lent
you
this
lovely
place
not
fonder
than
we
are
said
myra
smiling
at
him
iv
before
lunch
i
found
myra
in
the
hammock
at
the
end
of
the
loggia
hallo
i
said
hallo
she
looked
up
from
her
book
and
waved
her
hand
mentone
on
the
left
monte
carlo
on
the
right
she
said
and
returned
to
her
book
again
simpson
had
mentioned
the
situation
so
many
times
that
it
had
become
a
with
us
fancy
reading
on
a
lovely
morning
like
this
i
complained
but
that
why
it
a
very
gloomy
play
by
ibsen
and
whenever
simply
more
than
i
can
bear
i
look
up
and
see
mentone
on
the
left
monte
carlo
on
the
right
i
mean
i
see
all
the
loveliness
round
me
and
then
i
know
the
world
is
so
bad
after
all
she
put
her
book
down
are
you
alone
i
gripped
her
wrist
suddenly
and
put
the
to
her
throat
are
alone
i
hissed
or
whatever
you
do
to
a
sentence
without
any
s
in
it
to
make
it
dramatic
your
friends
can
not
save
you
now
prepare
to
er
come
a
walk
up
the
hill
with
me
help
help
whispered
myra
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
swung
herself
out
of
the
hammock
and
went
in
for
her
hat
we
climbed
up
a
steep
path
which
led
to
the
above
us
simpson
had
told
us
that
we
must
see
the
village
still
more
earnestly
he
had
begged
us
to
see
corsica
the
view
of
corsica
was
to
be
obtained
from
a
point
some
miles
up
too
far
to
go
before
lunch
however
we
can
always
say
we
saw
it
i
reassured
myra
from
this
distance
you
ca
be
certain
of
recognizing
an
island
you
do
know
any
small
cloud
on
the
horizon
will
do
i
know
it
on
the
map
yes
but
it
looks
quite
different
in
real
life
the
great
thing
is
to
be
able
to
assure
simpson
at
lunch
that
the
corsican
question
is
now
closed
when
we
a
little
higher
up
i
shall
say
that
corsica
and
you
say
as
though
you
rather
expected
the
isle
of
wight
and
then
it
be
all
over
hallo
we
had
just
passed
the
narrow
archway
leading
into
the
courtyard
of
the
village
and
were
following
the
path
up
the
hill
but
in
that
moment
of
passing
we
had
been
observed
behind
us
a
dozen
village
children
now
trailed
eagerly
oh
the
dears
cried
myra
but
i
think
we
made
a
mistake
to
bring
them
i
said
severely
no
one
is
fonder
of
our
one
two
three
i
make
it
eleven
our
eleven
children
than
i
am
but
there
are
times
when
father
and
mother
want
to
be
alone
i
sorry
dear
i
thought
you
be
so
proud
to
have
them
all
with
you
i
proud
of
them
to
reflect
that
all
the
one
two
i
make
it
thirteen
all
these
thirteen
are
ours
is
very
inspiring
but
i
like
people
to
think
that
we
can
not
afford
our
youngest
our
little
philomene
shoes
and
stockings
and
giuseppe
should
have
washed
his
face
since
last
friday
these
are
small
matters
but
they
are
very
trying
to
a
father
have
you
any
coppers
asked
myra
suddenly
you
forget
their
last
week
one
two
three
i
can
not
possibly
afford
one
two
three
four
myra
i
do
wish
you
count
them
definitely
and
tell
me
how
many
we
have
one
likes
to
know
i
can
not
afford
for
more
than
a
dozen
ten
she
took
a
franc
from
me
and
gave
it
to
the
biggest
girl
our
first
and
getting
on
so
nicely
with
her
french
rapidly
she
explained
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
look
of
intense
rapture
slowly
straightening
itself
to
one
of
ordinary
gratitude
as
the
financial
standing
of
the
other
nine
in
the
business
became
clear
then
we
waved
farewell
to
our
family
and
went
on
high
above
the
village
a
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
we
rested
and
looked
down
upon
the
silvery
olives
stretching
into
the
blue
and
more
particularly
upon
one
red
roof
which
stood
up
amid
the
trees
that
the
cardews
villa
i
said
myra
was
silent
when
myra
married
me
she
promised
to
love
honour
and
write
all
my
letters
for
me
for
we
agreed
before
the
ceremony
that
the
word
obey
should
mean
nothing
more
than
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
letters
the
thank
you
very
much
for
asking
us
we
shall
be
delighted
to
come
and
the
thank
you
very
much
for
having
us
we
enjoyed
it
immensely
with
these
off
my
mind
i
could
really
concentrate
on
my
work
or
my
short
mashie
shots
or
whatever
was
of
importance
but
there
was
now
a
new
kind
of
letter
to
write
and
one
rather
outside
the
terms
of
our
original
understanding
a
friend
of
mine
had
told
his
friends
the
cardews
that
we
were
going
out
to
the
riviera
and
would
let
them
know
when
we
arrived
and
we
had
arrived
a
week
ago
it
is
at
all
an
easy
letter
to
write
said
myra
it
practically
asking
a
stranger
for
hospitality
let
us
say
our
readiness
to
accept
it
it
sounds
better
myra
smiled
slowly
to
herself
cardew
she
said
are
ready
for
lunch
when
you
are
yours
sincerely
well
that
the
idea
and
then
what
about
the
others
if
the
cardews
are
going
to
be
nice
we
do
want
to
leave
dahlia
and
all
of
them
out
of
it
i
thought
it
over
carefully
for
a
little
what
you
want
to
do
i
said
at
last
is
to
write
a
really
long
letter
to
cardew
acquainting
her
with
all
the
facts
keep
nothing
back
from
her
i
should
begin
by
dwelling
on
the
personnel
of
our
little
company
husband
and
i
you
should
say
not
alone
we
have
also
with
us
and
archibald
mannering
a
delightful
couple
mannering
is
something
in
the
territorials
when
he
is
not
looking
after
his
estate
his
wife
is
a
great
favourite
in
the
county
next
i
have
to
introduce
to
you
thomas
todd
an
agreeable
young
bachelor
thomas
todd
is
in
the
department
of
the
admiralty
by
whose
exertions
so
long
as
we
preserve
the
todds
to
formula
or
excluding
canadian
todds
to
britannia
rules
the
waves
lastly
there
is
samuel
simpson
short
of
sight
but
warm
of
heart
and
with
on
a
bad
pitch
a
nasty
break
from
the
off
simpson
is
a
of
some
eminence
but
little
circulation
combining
on
the
cornet
intense
with
no
execution
and
on
the
golf
course
an
endless
enthusiasm
with
only
an
occasional
contact
this
dear
cardew
is
our
little
party
i
say
nothing
of
my
husband
go
on
smiled
myra
you
have
still
to
explain
how
we
invite
ourselves
to
lunch
we
do
we
leave
that
to
her
all
we
do
is
to
give
a
list
of
the
meals
in
which
in
the
ordinary
course
we
are
wont
to
indulge
together
with
a
few
notes
on
our
relative
capacities
at
each
you
wind
up
is
at
luncheon
time
that
as
a
party
we
show
to
the
best
advantage
some
day
my
dear
cardew
we
must
all
meet
at
lunch
you
will
then
see
that
i
have
exaggerated
neither
my
husband
appetite
nor
the
light
conversation
of
my
brother
nor
the
power
of
apology
should
any
little
occur
of
samuel
simpson
let
us
i
say
meet
at
lunch
let
us
i
took
out
my
watch
suddenly
come
on
i
said
getting
up
and
giving
a
hand
to
myra
we
shall
only
just
be
in
time
for
it
the
gamesters
it
about
time
said
simpson
one
evening
that
we
went
to
the
tables
and
er
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
had
a
little
flutter
we
all
looked
at
him
in
silent
admiration
oh
samuel
sighed
myra
and
i
promised
your
aunt
that
you
gamble
while
you
were
away
but
my
dear
myra
it
the
first
thing
the
fellows
at
the
club
ask
you
when
you
been
to
the
riviera
if
you
had
any
luck
well
you
had
a
lot
of
luck
said
archie
several
times
when
been
standing
on
the
heights
and
calling
attention
to
the
beautiful
view
below
i
said
to
myself
push
and
he
a
deader
but
something
some
mysterious
agency
within
has
kept
me
back
all
the
fellows
at
the
club
simpson
is
popularly
supposed
to
belong
to
a
fleet
street
toilet
and
hairdressing
club
where
for
three
guineas
a
year
he
gets
shaved
every
day
and
has
his
hair
cut
whenever
myra
insists
on
the
many
occasions
when
he
authorizes
a
startling
story
of
some
statesman
with
the
words
my
dear
old
chap
i
know
it
for
a
fact
i
heard
it
at
the
club
from
a
friend
of
his
then
we
know
that
once
again
the
barber
assistant
has
been
gossiping
over
the
lather
do
think
samuel
i
interrupted
how
much
more
splendid
if
you
could
be
the
only
man
who
had
seen
monte
carlo
without
going
inside
the
rooms
and
then
when
the
hairdresser
when
your
friends
at
the
club
ask
if
you
had
any
luck
at
the
tables
you
just
say
coldly
tables
preferably
in
latin
said
archie
but
it
was
obviously
no
good
arguing
with
him
besides
we
were
all
keen
enough
to
go
we
need
lose
said
myra
we
might
win
good
idea
said
thomas
he
lit
his
pipe
and
added
simpson
was
telling
me
about
his
system
last
night
at
least
he
was
just
beginning
when
i
went
to
sleep
he
applied
another
match
to
his
pipe
and
went
on
as
if
the
idea
had
suddenly
struck
him
perhaps
it
was
only
his
internal
system
he
meant
i
did
wait
samuel
you
quite
well
inside
are
you
quite
myra
but
i
invented
a
sort
of
system
for
which
we
might
there
only
one
system
which
is
any
good
pronounced
archie
it
the
system
by
which
when
you
lost
all
your
own
money
you
turn
to
the
man
next
to
you
and
say
me
a
louis
dear
old
chap
till
christmas
i
forgotten
my
purse
no
systems
said
dahlia
let
make
a
collection
and
put
it
all
on
one
number
and
hope
it
will
win
dahlia
had
obviously
been
reading
novels
about
people
who
break
the
bank
it
as
good
a
way
of
losing
as
any
other
said
archie
let
do
it
for
our
first
gamble
anyway
simpson
as
our
host
shall
put
the
money
on
i
as
his
oldest
friend
shall
watch
him
to
see
that
he
does
it
what
the
number
to
be
we
all
thought
hard
for
several
moments
samuel
what
your
age
asked
myra
at
last
right
off
the
board
said
thomas
you
not
really
more
than
myra
whispered
to
him
tell
me
as
a
secret
peter
nearly
two
said
dahlia
do
you
think
you
could
nearly
put
our
money
on
asked
archie
i
once
made
seventeen
i
said
on
that
day
when
i
went
in
first
with
archie
that
settles
it
here
to
the
highest
score
of
the
afternoon
we
put
our
money
on
seventeen
simpson
you
have
between
now
and
to
perfect
your
french
delivery
of
the
magic
word
i
went
to
bed
a
proud
but
anxious
man
that
night
it
was
famous
score
which
had
decided
the
figure
that
was
to
bring
us
fortune
and
yet
and
yet
suppose
eighteen
turned
up
the
remorse
the
bitterness
if
only
i
should
tell
myself
if
only
we
had
run
three
instead
of
two
for
that
cut
to
suppose
it
were
sixteen
why
oh
why
i
should
groan
did
i
make
the
scorer
put
that
bye
down
as
a
hit
suppose
it
were
but
there
my
responsibility
ended
if
it
were
going
to
be
they
should
have
used
one
of
archie
scores
and
made
a
good
job
of
it
at
next
day
we
were
in
the
fatal
building
i
should
like
to
pause
here
and
describe
my
costume
to
you
which
was
a
quiet
grey
in
the
best
of
taste
but
myra
says
that
if
i
do
this
i
must
describe
hers
too
a
feat
beyond
me
sufficient
that
she
looked
dazzling
that
as
a
party
we
were
remarkably
and
that
simpson
murmuring
to
himself
at
intervals
led
the
way
through
the
rooms
till
he
found
a
table
to
his
liking
are
you
excited
whispered
myra
to
me
frightfully
i
said
and
left
my
mouth
well
open
i
do
quite
know
what
picture
of
the
event
myra
and
i
had
conjured
up
in
our
minds
but
i
fancy
it
was
one
something
like
this
at
the
entrance
into
the
rooms
of
such
a
large
and
obviously
distinguished
party
there
would
be
a
slight
sensation
among
the
crowd
and
way
would
be
made
for
us
at
the
most
important
table
it
would
then
leak
out
that
chevalier
simpson
the
tall
gentleman
in
the
middle
my
dear
had
brought
with
him
no
less
a
sum
than
thirty
francs
with
which
to
break
the
bank
and
that
he
proposed
to
do
this
in
one
daring
at
this
news
the
players
at
the
other
tables
would
hastily
leave
their
winnings
or
losings
and
crowd
round
us
chevalier
simpson
pale
but
controlled
would
then
place
his
money
on
seventeen
he
would
say
to
the
croupier
to
make
it
quite
clear
and
the
ball
would
be
spun
as
it
slowed
down
the
tension
in
the
crowd
would
increase
a
woman
would
cry
in
a
shrill
voice
there
would
be
guttural
exclamations
from
germans
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
strong
men
would
swoon
at
last
a
sudden
shriek
and
the
croupier
voice
trembling
for
the
first
time
for
thirty
years
then
gold
and
notes
would
be
pushed
at
the
chevalier
he
would
stuff
his
pockets
with
them
he
would
fill
his
hat
with
them
we
others
we
would
stuff
our
pockets
too
the
bank
would
send
out
for
more
money
there
would
be
loud
cheers
from
all
the
company
with
the
exception
of
one
man
who
had
put
five
francs
on
sixteen
and
had
shot
himself
and
we
should
be
carried
that
is
to
say
we
four
men
shoulder
high
to
the
door
while
by
the
deserted
table
myra
and
dahlia
clung
to
each
other
weeping
tears
of
happiness
something
like
that
what
happened
was
different
as
far
as
i
could
follow
it
was
this
over
the
heads
of
an
enormous
and
utterly
indifferent
crowd
simpson
handed
his
thirty
francs
to
the
croupier
he
said
the
croupier
with
his
rake
pushed
the
money
on
to
seventeen
another
croupier
with
his
rake
pulled
it
off
again
and
stuck
to
it
the
day
fun
was
over
what
win
asked
myra
some
minutes
later
when
the
fact
that
we
should
never
see
our
money
again
had
been
brought
home
to
her
zero
said
archie
i
sighed
heavily
my
usual
score
i
said
not
my
highest
vi
the
record
of
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
peter
again
said
dahlia
as
she
folded
up
her
letter
from
home
peter
previous
letter
dictated
to
his
had
according
to
archie
been
full
of
good
things
of
the
proud
father
however
had
failed
to
reveal
anything
more
stirring
than
i
love
mummy
and
er
so
on
we
were
sitting
in
the
loggia
after
what
i
do
call
breakfast
all
of
us
except
simpson
who
was
busy
with
a
mysterious
package
we
had
not
many
days
left
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
that
personally
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
see
things
like
porridge
again
each
to
his
taste
the
time
has
passed
absurdly
quickly
said
myra
we
do
seem
to
have
done
except
enjoy
ourselves
i
mean
anything
specially
rivierish
but
it
been
heavenly
we
done
lots
of
rivierish
things
i
protested
if
you
be
quiet
a
moment
i
tell
you
some
these
were
some
of
the
things
we
had
been
to
the
riviera
nothing
could
take
away
from
that
we
had
the
labels
on
our
luggage
we
had
lost
heavily
thirty
francs
at
the
tables
this
alone
justified
the
journey
myra
had
sat
next
to
a
prince
at
lunch
of
course
she
might
have
done
this
in
london
but
so
far
there
has
been
no
great
rush
of
princes
to
our
little
flat
dukes
mayors
companions
of
michael
and
george
certainly
but
somehow
not
princes
simpson
had
done
the
short
third
hole
at
mt
agel
in
three
his
first
had
cleverly
dislodged
the
ball
from
the
tee
his
second
a
sudden
nick
had
set
it
rolling
down
the
hill
to
the
green
and
the
third
an
accidental
putt
had
sunk
it
myra
and
i
had
seen
corsica
question
and
finally
and
best
of
all
we
had
sat
in
the
sun
under
a
blue
sky
above
a
blue
sea
and
watched
the
oranges
and
lemons
grow
so
though
we
had
been
to
but
few
of
the
famous
beauty
spots
around
we
had
had
a
delightfully
lazy
time
and
as
proof
that
we
had
not
really
been
at
brighton
there
were
as
i
have
said
the
luggage
labels
but
we
were
to
be
able
to
show
further
proof
at
this
moment
simpson
came
out
of
the
house
his
face
beaming
with
excitement
his
hands
carefully
concealing
something
behind
his
back
guess
what
i
got
he
said
eagerly
the
sack
said
thomas
your
new
bests
said
archie
something
that
will
interest
us
all
helped
simpson
i
withdraw
my
suggestion
said
archie
something
we
ought
to
have
brought
with
us
all
along
more
money
said
myra
the
tension
was
extreme
it
was
obvious
that
our
consuming
anxiety
would
have
to
be
relieved
very
speedily
to
avoid
a
riot
thomas
went
behind
simpson
back
and
took
his
surprise
away
from
him
a
camera
he
said
good
idea
simpson
was
all
over
himself
with
i
suddenly
thought
of
it
the
other
night
he
said
smiling
round
at
all
of
us
in
his
happiness
and
i
was
just
going
to
wake
thomas
up
to
tell
him
when
i
thought
i
keep
it
a
secret
so
i
wrote
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
asked
him
to
send
me
out
one
and
some
films
and
things
just
as
a
surprise
for
you
samuel
you
a
dear
said
myra
looking
at
him
lovingly
you
see
i
thought
myra
you
like
to
have
some
records
of
the
place
because
they
so
jolly
to
look
back
on
and
er
i
not
quite
sure
how
you
work
it
but
i
expect
some
of
you
know
and
er
come
on
said
myra
i
show
you
she
retired
with
simpson
to
a
secluded
part
of
the
loggia
and
helped
him
put
the
films
in
nothing
can
save
us
said
archie
we
are
going
to
be
taken
together
in
a
group
simpson
will
send
it
to
one
of
the
picture
papers
and
we
shall
appear
as
merry
little
party
of
names
from
left
to
right
blank
blank
archibald
mannering
blank
blank
i
better
go
and
brush
my
hair
simpson
returned
to
us
nervous
and
fully
charged
with
advice
right
myra
i
see
that
be
all
right
oh
look
here
do
you
oh
yes
i
see
right
now
then
wait
a
bit
oh
yes
i
got
it
now
then
what
shall
we
have
first
a
group
take
the
house
and
the
garden
and
the
village
said
thomas
you
see
plenty
of
afterwards
the
first
one
is
bound
to
be
a
failure
i
pointed
out
rather
let
him
fail
at
us
who
are
known
to
be
beautiful
than
at
the
garden
which
has
its
reputation
yet
to
make
afterwards
when
he
has
got
the
knack
he
will
be
able
to
do
justice
to
the
scenery
archie
joined
us
again
followed
by
the
we
grouped
ourselves
picturesquely
that
looks
ripping
said
simpson
oh
look
here
myra
do
you
no
do
come
you
spoil
the
picture
i
suppose
you
have
to
oh
it
all
right
i
think
i
got
it
i
sha
try
to
look
handsome
this
time
said
archie
it
not
worth
it
i
shall
just
put
an
ordinary
blurred
expression
on
now
are
you
ready
do
move
quite
still
please
quite
it
instantaneous
you
know
said
myra
gently
this
so
unnerved
simpson
that
he
let
the
thing
off
without
any
further
warning
before
we
had
time
to
get
our
expressions
natural
that
was
all
right
myra
was
it
he
said
proudly
i
i
afraid
you
had
your
hand
over
the
lens
samuel
dear
our
new
photographic
series
of
the
great
no
simpson
murmured
archie
it
would
have
been
a
very
good
one
anyhow
i
said
encouragingly
it
was
typical
dahlia
should
have
had
an
orange
in
her
hand
and
myra
might
have
been
resting
her
cheek
against
a
cactus
try
it
again
simpson
and
get
a
little
more
colour
into
it
he
tried
again
and
got
a
lot
more
colour
into
it
strictly
speaking
said
myra
sadly
you
ought
to
have
got
it
on
to
a
new
film
simpson
looked
in
horror
at
the
back
of
his
camera
found
that
he
had
forgotten
to
turn
the
handle
apologized
profusely
and
wound
up
very
gingerly
till
the
number
approached
now
then
he
said
looking
up
and
found
himself
alone
as
i
write
this
in
london
i
have
simpson
album
in
front
of
me
should
you
ever
do
us
the
honour
of
dining
with
us
as
i
hope
you
will
and
which
seems
impossible
should
there
ever
come
a
moment
when
the
conversation
runs
low
and
you
are
revolving
in
your
mind
whether
it
is
worth
while
asking
us
if
we
have
been
to
any
theatres
lately
then
i
shall
produce
the
album
and
you
will
be
left
in
no
doubt
that
we
are
just
back
from
the
riviera
you
will
see
oranges
and
lemons
and
olives
and
cactuses
and
palms
blue
sky
if
you
have
enough
imagination
and
still
bluer
sea
picturesque
villas
curious
effects
of
rocks
distant
backgrounds
of
mountain
and
on
the
last
page
the
clever
kindly
face
of
simpson
the
whole
affair
will
probably
bore
you
to
tears
but
with
myra
and
me
the
case
of
course
is
different
we
find
these
things
as
simpson
said
very
jolly
to
look
back
on
ii
men
of
letters
men
of
letters
john
penquarto
a
tale
of
literary
life
in
london
on
the
hundred
best
i
john
penquarto
looked
round
his
diminutive
with
a
feeling
of
excitement
not
unmixed
with
awe
so
this
was
london
the
new
life
had
begun
with
a
beating
heart
he
unpacked
his
bag
and
set
out
his
simple
belongings
first
his
books
his
treasured
books
where
should
he
put
them
it
was
comforting
to
think
that
wherever
they
stood
they
would
be
within
reach
of
his
hand
as
he
lay
in
bed
he
placed
them
on
the
and
read
their
titles
again
reverently
with
our
the
fretworker
companion
and
strenuous
days
in
simla
he
owed
everything
to
them
and
what
an
air
they
gave
the
room
but
not
such
an
air
as
was
given
by
his
other
treasure
the
photograph
of
mary
mary
he
had
only
met
her
once
and
that
was
twenty
years
ago
at
his
native
polwollop
he
had
gone
to
the
big
house
with
a
message
for
trevena
her
ladyship
butler
mother
respects
and
she
has
found
the
other
and
will
send
it
up
as
soon
as
it
is
dry
he
had
often
taken
a
similar
message
for
penquarto
did
the
washing
for
the
upper
servants
at
the
hall
but
somehow
he
had
known
that
was
going
to
be
different
there
just
inside
the
gates
was
mary
he
was
only
six
but
even
then
he
knew
that
never
would
he
see
again
anything
so
beautiful
she
was
five
but
there
was
something
in
her
manner
of
holding
herself
and
the
imperious
tilt
of
her
head
which
made
her
seem
almost
i
mary
she
said
he
wanted
to
say
that
he
was
john
but
could
not
he
stood
there
i
love
you
she
went
on
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
he
felt
suffocated
he
longed
to
say
so
do
i
but
was
afraid
that
it
was
not
good
english
even
then
he
knew
that
he
must
be
a
writer
when
he
grew
up
she
leant
forward
and
kissed
him
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
in
love
the
need
for
was
strong
upon
him
shyly
he
brought
out
his
last
and
shared
it
with
her
he
had
never
seen
her
since
but
even
now
twenty
years
after
he
could
not
eat
an
without
emotion
and
a
whole
bag
of
them
brought
the
scene
back
so
visibly
as
to
be
almost
a
pain
yes
he
was
to
be
a
writer
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
everybody
had
noticed
it
the
vicar
had
said
johnny
will
never
do
any
good
at
polwollop
i
fear
and
the
farmer
for
whom
john
scared
rooks
had
said
thiccy
seems
and
one
after
another
of
friends
had
given
similar
testimony
and
now
here
he
was
at
in
the
little
in
bloomsbury
ready
to
write
the
great
novel
which
should
take
london
by
storm
polwollop
seemed
a
hundred
years
away
feverishly
he
seized
pen
and
paper
and
began
to
wonder
what
to
write
ii
it
was
near
the
albert
memorial
that
the
great
inspiration
came
to
him
some
weeks
later
those
had
been
weeks
of
mingled
hope
and
despair
of
hope
as
he
had
fondled
again
his
treasured
books
and
read
their
titles
or
gazed
at
the
photograph
of
mary
of
despair
as
he
had
taken
off
his
belt
and
counted
out
his
stock
of
money
or
reflected
that
he
was
as
far
from
completing
his
novel
as
ever
sometimes
in
the
search
for
an
idea
he
had
frequented
the
restaurants
where
the
great
samuel
johnson
himself
had
eaten
and
sometimes
he
had
frequented
other
restaurants
where
even
the
great
samuel
johnson
himself
had
been
unable
to
eat
often
he
had
gone
into
the
british
museum
and
leant
against
a
or
taken
a
to
chelsea
and
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
which
marked
carlyle
house
but
no
inspiration
had
come
and
then
suddenly
quite
close
to
the
albert
memorial
he
knew
he
would
write
a
novel
about
a
boy
called
william
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
who
came
to
london
and
wrote
a
novel
a
novel
of
which
the
westminster
gazette
said
this
novel
undoubtedly
places
the
author
in
the
front
rank
of
living
novelists
william
novel
would
be
a
realistic
account
of
yes
that
was
it
of
a
boy
called
henry
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
who
came
to
london
and
wrote
a
novel
a
novel
of
which
the
morning
post
said
by
this
novel
the
author
has
indubitably
established
his
claim
to
be
reckoned
among
the
few
living
novelists
who
count
but
stay
what
should
this
novel
of
henry
be
about
it
would
be
necessary
to
describe
it
for
an
hour
he
wrestled
with
the
problem
and
then
he
had
another
inspiration
henry
novel
would
be
about
a
boy
called
thomas
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
who
came
to
london
and
wrote
a
novel
about
a
boy
called
stephen
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
who
came
to
london
and
wrote
a
novel
about
a
boy
called
michael
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
who
came
to
london
and
wrote
a
novel
about
a
boy
called
peter
who
had
lived
in
cornwall
and
and
so
on
and
every
one
of
the
novels
would
establish
the
author
right
to
be
reckoned
and
place
him
undoubtedly
in
the
very
front
rank
it
was
a
stupendous
idea
for
a
moment
john
was
almost
paralysed
at
contemplation
of
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
his
novel
as
he
had
planned
it
was
it
too
much
for
his
powers
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
out
he
hurried
back
to
his
seized
a
pen
and
began
to
write
iii
it
was
two
years
later
for
the
last
fortnight
john
penquarto
had
stopped
counting
the
money
in
his
belt
there
was
none
left
for
a
fortnight
now
he
had
been
living
on
the
belt
itself
but
a
great
hope
had
always
sustained
him
one
day
he
would
hear
from
the
publisher
to
whom
he
had
sent
his
novel
a
year
ago
and
now
at
last
the
letter
had
come
and
he
was
seated
in
the
office
of
the
great
pump
himself
his
heart
beat
rapidly
he
felt
suffocated
well
penquarto
said
the
smiling
publisher
i
may
say
at
once
that
we
like
your
novel
we
should
have
written
before
but
we
have
only
just
finished
reading
it
it
is
a
little
long
about
two
million
eight
hundred
thousand
words
i
reckon
it
but
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
which
will
meet
that
difficulty
i
suggest
that
we
publish
it
in
half
a
dozen
volumes
stopping
for
the
first
volume
at
the
press
notices
of
say
peter
novel
we
find
that
the
public
likes
these
continuous
books
about
terms
we
will
send
an
agreement
along
naturally
as
this
is
a
first
book
we
can
only
pay
a
nominal
sum
on
account
of
royalties
say
ten
thousand
pounds
how
will
that
suit
you
with
a
heart
still
beating
john
left
the
office
five
minutes
later
and
bought
a
new
belt
then
he
went
to
a
restaurant
where
goldsmith
had
never
been
and
ordered
a
joint
and
two
veg
success
had
come
iv
i
should
like
to
dwell
upon
the
weeks
which
followed
i
should
like
to
tell
of
john
emotion
when
he
saw
his
first
proofs
and
of
the
emotion
when
he
saw
what
a
mess
john
had
made
of
them
i
should
like
to
describe
how
my
hero
heart
beat
during
the
anxious
days
of
waiting
to
picture
to
you
his
pride
at
the
arrival
of
his
six
free
copies
and
his
landlady
surprise
when
he
presented
her
with
one
above
all
i
should
like
to
bring
home
to
you
the
eagerness
with
which
he
bought
and
opened
the
times
literary
supplement
and
read
his
first
review
trewulliam
the
first
phase
by
john
penquarto
by
albert
pump
i
have
no
time
to
go
into
these
matters
nor
have
i
time
in
which
to
give
at
length
his
later
press
cuttings
in
which
there
was
displayed
a
unanimity
of
opinion
that
john
penquarto
was
now
in
the
front
rank
of
living
novelists
one
of
the
limited
number
whose
work
really
counted
i
must
hurry
on
it
was
a
week
after
the
publication
of
william
trewulliam
the
novel
which
had
taken
all
london
by
storm
in
all
the
of
mayfair
in
all
the
clubs
of
pall
mall
people
were
asking
each
other
who
is
john
penquarto
nobody
knew
save
one
lady
mary
knew
it
was
not
the
name
penquarto
which
had
told
her
it
was
yes
you
have
guessed
the
scene
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
when
william
trewulliam
meets
the
little
anne
and
shares
his
last
with
her
even
under
this
disguise
she
recognized
that
early
meeting
she
pierced
beneath
the
imagination
of
the
novelist
to
the
recollection
of
the
man
john
penquarto
of
course
now
she
remembered
the
name
it
had
always
been
a
mystery
to
her
friends
why
lady
mary
had
never
married
no
girl
in
society
had
been
more
eagerly
courted
it
was
whispered
that
already
she
had
refused
more
than
one
archbishop
three
newspaper
proprietors
and
a
couple
of
dukes
something
she
scarcely
knew
what
told
her
that
this
was
not
love
she
must
wait
as
she
dressed
to
go
to
the
duchess
of
bilberry
at
home
she
wondered
if
she
would
ever
meet
john
penquarto
again
and
if
he
had
altered
mary
it
was
john
speaking
he
had
seen
her
the
moment
she
came
in
at
the
door
something
was
it
the
duchess
champagne
at
dinner
had
reminded
him
of
the
they
had
eaten
together
and
this
had
brought
back
his
memories
in
a
flood
he
would
meet
her
again
he
knew
it
instinctively
besides
it
was
like
this
that
william
trewulliam
had
met
anne
again
and
henry
polhenery
had
met
sarah
and
thomas
pentummas
had
met
alice
and
well
anyhow
he
knew
john
it
was
mary
speaking
perhaps
you
had
guessed
you
knew
me
this
is
john
it
was
his
turn
i
knew
you
said
mary
do
you
remember
mary
blushed
and
john
did
not
deviate
from
the
healthy
red
colour
which
he
had
maintained
throughout
the
conversation
in
spite
of
his
success
he
was
never
quite
at
ease
in
society
at
this
period
of
his
life
nor
were
henry
polhenery
and
thomas
pentummas
they
remained
handsome
but
awkward
which
was
why
women
loved
them
so
i
love
you
john
speaking
i
think
i
must
have
always
loved
you
mary
going
it
he
took
her
hand
in
his
nobody
noticed
them
they
were
as
much
alone
as
if
they
had
been
at
the
national
gallery
together
many
of
the
guests
were
going
through
similar
scenes
of
recognition
and
others
were
asking
each
other
if
they
had
read
william
trewulliam
yet
and
lying
about
it
others
again
were
making
for
the
buffet
john
and
mary
had
the
world
to
themselves
v
they
were
married
a
month
later
john
who
did
not
look
his
best
in
a
had
pleaded
for
a
quiet
wedding
and
only
the
duchess
of
bilberry
and
pump
were
present
at
the
simple
ceremony
which
took
place
at
the
bloomsbury
then
the
happy
couple
drove
away
and
where
are
they
spending
the
honeymoon
ah
do
you
need
to
ask
at
greenwich
no
fathead
not
at
greenwich
at
look
here
i
do
believe
you
trying
have
another
shot
yes
dear
reader
you
are
right
they
are
going
back
to
polwollop
it
might
be
a
good
plan
to
leave
them
there
the
complete
dramatist
i
take
it
that
every
man
and
woman
in
this
country
wants
to
write
a
play
since
the
news
first
got
about
that
orlando
made
out
of
the
crimson
sponge
there
has
been
a
feeling
that
only
through
the
medium
of
the
stage
can
literary
art
find
its
true
expression
the
successful
playwright
is
indeed
a
man
to
be
envied
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
the
prizes
which
fall
to
his
lot
are
worth
something
of
an
effort
he
sees
his
name
correctly
spelt
on
which
go
to
such
different
spots
as
hammersmith
and
west
norwood
and
his
name
spelt
incorrectly
beneath
the
photograph
of
somebody
else
in
the
illustrated
butler
he
is
a
welcome
figure
at
the
of
the
elect
who
are
always
ready
to
encourage
him
by
accepting
free
seats
for
his
play
nod
to
him
editors
allow
him
to
contribute
without
charge
to
a
symposium
on
the
price
of
golf
balls
in
short
he
becomes
a
prominent
figure
in
london
society
and
if
he
is
not
careful
somebody
will
say
so
but
even
the
unsuccessful
dramatist
has
his
moments
i
knew
a
young
man
who
married
somebody
else
mother
and
was
allowed
by
her
fourteen
gardeners
to
amuse
himself
sometimes
by
rolling
the
it
was
an
unsatisfying
life
and
when
rash
acquaintances
asked
him
what
he
did
he
used
to
say
that
he
was
for
the
bar
now
he
says
he
is
writing
a
play
and
we
look
round
the
spacious
lawns
and
terraces
and
marvel
at
the
run
his
last
one
must
have
had
however
i
assume
that
you
who
read
this
are
actually
in
need
of
the
dibs
your
play
must
be
not
merely
a
good
play
but
a
successful
one
how
shall
this
success
be
achieved
frankly
i
can
not
always
say
if
you
came
to
me
and
said
i
am
on
the
stock
exchange
and
bulls
are
going
down
or
up
or
sideways
or
whatever
it
might
be
there
no
money
to
be
made
in
the
city
nowadays
and
i
want
to
write
a
play
instead
how
shall
i
do
it
well
i
help
you
but
suppose
you
said
i
fond
of
writing
my
people
always
say
my
letters
home
are
good
enough
for
i
got
a
little
idea
for
a
play
about
a
man
and
a
woman
and
another
woman
and
but
perhaps
i
better
keep
the
plot
a
secret
for
the
moment
anyhow
it
jolly
exciting
and
i
can
do
the
dialogue
all
right
the
only
thing
is
i
know
anything
about
technique
and
stagecraft
and
the
three
unities
and
that
sort
of
rot
can
you
give
me
a
few
hints
suppose
you
spoke
to
me
like
this
then
i
could
do
something
for
you
my
dear
sir
i
should
reply
or
madam
you
have
come
to
the
right
shop
lend
me
your
ear
for
ten
minutes
and
you
shall
learn
just
what
stagecraft
is
and
i
should
begin
with
a
short
homily
on
soliloquy
if
you
ever
read
your
shakespeare
and
no
dramatist
should
despise
the
works
of
another
dramatist
he
may
always
pick
up
something
in
them
which
may
be
useful
for
his
next
play
if
you
ever
read
your
shakespeare
it
is
possible
that
you
have
come
across
this
passage
hamlet
to
be
or
not
to
be
and
so
on
in
the
same
vein
for
some
thirty
lines
these
few
remarks
are
called
a
soliloquy
being
addressed
rather
to
the
world
in
general
than
to
any
particular
person
on
the
stage
now
the
object
of
this
soliloquy
is
plain
the
dramatist
wished
us
to
know
the
thoughts
which
were
passing
through
hamlet
mind
and
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
think
of
in
which
to
do
it
of
course
a
really
good
actor
can
often
give
a
clue
to
the
feelings
of
a
character
simply
by
facial
expression
there
are
ways
of
shifting
the
eyebrows
distending
the
nostrils
and
exploring
the
lower
molars
with
the
tongue
by
which
it
is
possible
to
denote
respectively
surprise
defiance
and
doubt
indeed
irresolution
being
the
keynote
of
hamlet
soliloquy
a
clever
player
could
to
some
extent
indicate
the
whole
thirty
lines
by
a
silent
working
of
the
jaw
but
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
he
would
miss
the
finer
shades
of
the
dramatist
meaning
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
to
take
only
one
line
would
tax
the
most
elastic
face
so
the
soliloquy
came
into
being
we
moderns
however
see
the
absurdity
of
it
in
real
life
no
one
thinks
aloud
or
in
an
empty
room
the
dramatist
must
certainly
avoid
this
hallmark
of
the
play
what
then
is
to
be
done
if
it
be
granted
first
that
the
thoughts
of
a
certain
character
should
be
known
to
the
audience
and
secondly
that
soliloquy
or
the
habit
of
thinking
aloud
is
in
opposition
to
modern
stage
technique
how
shall
a
soliloquy
be
avoided
without
damage
to
the
play
well
there
are
more
ways
than
one
and
now
we
come
to
what
is
meant
by
stagecraft
stagecraft
is
the
art
of
getting
over
these
and
other
difficulties
and
if
possible
getting
over
them
in
a
showy
manner
so
that
people
will
say
how
remarkable
his
stagecraft
is
for
so
young
a
writer
when
otherwise
they
might
have
noticed
it
at
all
thus
in
this
play
we
have
been
talking
about
an
easy
way
of
avoiding
soliloquy
would
be
for
ophelia
to
speak
first
what
are
you
thinking
about
my
lord
i
am
wondering
whether
to
be
or
not
to
be
whether
is
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
and
so
on
till
you
get
to
the
end
when
ophelia
might
say
ah
yes
or
something
of
that
sort
this
would
be
an
easy
way
of
doing
it
but
it
would
not
be
the
best
way
for
the
reason
that
it
is
too
easy
to
call
attention
to
itself
what
you
want
is
to
make
it
clear
that
you
are
conveying
hamlet
thoughts
to
the
audience
in
rather
a
clever
manner
that
this
can
now
be
done
we
have
to
thank
the
inventor
of
the
telephone
i
forget
his
name
the
telephone
has
revolutionized
the
stage
with
its
aid
you
can
convey
anything
you
like
across
the
footlights
in
the
old
play
it
was
frequently
necessary
for
one
of
the
characters
to
take
the
audience
into
his
confidence
having
disposed
of
my
uncle
body
he
would
say
to
the
stout
lady
in
the
third
row
of
the
stalls
i
now
have
leisure
in
which
to
search
for
the
will
but
first
to
lock
the
door
lest
i
should
be
interrupted
by
harold
wotnott
in
the
modern
play
he
simply
rings
up
an
imaginary
confederate
and
tells
him
what
he
is
going
to
do
could
anything
be
more
natural
let
us
to
give
an
example
of
how
this
method
works
go
back
again
to
the
play
we
have
been
discussing
hamlet
walks
quickly
across
the
room
to
the
telephone
and
takes
up
the
receiver
hallo
hallo
i
want
i
want
two
two
three
elsinore
yes
hallo
is
that
you
horatio
hamlet
speaking
i
say
i
been
wondering
about
this
business
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
is
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
what
no
hamlet
speaking
are
you
horatio
i
want
two
three
sorry
is
that
you
exchange
you
gave
me
i
want
hallo
is
that
you
horatio
hamlet
speaking
i
been
wondering
about
this
business
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
what
no
i
said
to
or
to
be
no
be
yes
that
right
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
is
nobler
and
so
on
you
see
how
effective
it
is
but
there
is
still
another
way
of
avoiding
the
soliloquy
which
is
sometimes
used
with
good
results
it
is
to
let
hamlet
if
that
happen
to
be
the
name
of
your
character
enter
with
a
small
dog
pet
falcon
mongoose
tame
bear
or
whatever
animal
is
most
in
keeping
with
the
part
and
confide
in
this
animal
such
sorrows
hopes
or
secret
history
as
the
audience
has
got
to
know
this
has
the
additional
advantage
of
putting
the
audience
immediately
in
sympathy
with
your
hero
how
of
him
all
the
ladies
say
to
tell
his
little
bantam
about
it
if
you
are
not
yet
tired
as
i
am
of
the
prince
of
denmark
i
will
explain
for
the
last
time
how
a
modern
author
might
his
speech
hamlet
his
to
to
be
or
not
to
be
ah
fido
fido
that
is
the
question
eh
old
fido
boy
whether
is
nobler
in
how
now
a
rat
rats
fido
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
sir
arrows
put
it
down
arrows
of
it
fido
good
old
dog
and
so
on
which
strikes
me
as
rather
sweet
and
natural
let
us
now
pass
on
to
the
very
important
question
of
exits
and
entrances
to
the
young
playwright
the
difficulty
of
getting
his
characters
on
to
the
stage
would
seem
much
less
than
the
difficulty
of
finding
them
something
to
say
when
they
are
there
he
writes
gaily
and
without
hesitation
lord
arthur
fluffinose
and
only
then
begins
to
bite
the
end
of
his
penholder
and
gaze
round
his
library
for
inspiration
yet
it
is
on
that
one
word
enter
that
his
reputation
for
dramatic
technique
will
hang
why
did
lord
arthur
fluffinose
enter
the
obvious
answer
that
the
firm
which
is
mentioned
in
the
programme
as
supplying
his
trousers
would
be
annoyed
if
he
did
is
not
enough
nor
is
it
enough
to
say
that
the
whole
plot
of
the
piece
hinges
on
him
and
that
without
him
the
drama
would
languish
what
the
critic
wants
to
know
is
why
lord
arthur
chose
that
very
moment
to
come
in
the
very
moment
when
lady
larkspur
was
left
alone
in
the
hall
of
larkspur
towers
was
it
only
a
coincidence
and
if
the
young
dramatist
answers
callously
yes
it
simply
shows
that
he
has
no
feeling
for
the
stage
whatever
in
that
case
i
need
go
on
with
this
article
however
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
assume
dear
reader
that
in
your
play
lord
arthur
had
a
good
reason
for
coming
in
if
that
be
so
he
must
explain
it
it
wo
do
to
write
like
this
lord
arthur
lady
larkspur
suddenly
and
turns
towards
arthur
here
gives
a
nod
of
confirmation
she
pauses
a
moment
and
then
with
a
sudden
passionate
movement
flings
herself
into
his
take
me
away
arthur
i
ca
bear
this
life
any
longer
larkspur
bit
me
again
this
morning
for
the
time
i
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
the
subsequent
scene
may
be
so
pathetic
that
on
the
hundredth
night
it
is
still
bringing
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
fireman
but
you
must
not
expect
to
be
treated
as
a
serious
dramatist
you
will
see
this
for
yourself
if
you
consider
the
passage
as
it
should
properly
have
been
written
lord
arthur
fluffinose
lady
larkspur
at
him
with
arthur
what
are
doing
here
i
caught
the
from
town
it
gets
in
at
and
i
walked
over
from
the
station
it
only
a
mile
at
this
point
he
looks
at
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
corner
and
the
audience
following
his
eyes
sees
that
it
is
seven
minutes
to
four
which
appears
delightfully
natural
i
came
to
tell
larkspur
to
sell
bungoes
they
are
going
down
larkspur
folding
her
hands
over
her
chest
and
gazing
broodingly
at
the
footlights
larkspur
arthur
anxiously
what
is
it
suddenly
has
he
been
you
again
larkspur
flinging
herself
into
his
arms
oh
arthur
arthur
take
me
away
and
so
on
but
it
may
well
be
that
lord
larkspur
has
an
intrigue
of
his
own
with
his
secretary
miss
devereux
and
if
their
big
scene
is
to
take
place
on
the
stage
too
the
hall
has
got
to
be
cleared
for
them
in
some
way
your
natural
instinct
will
be
to
say
fluffinose
lady
larkspur
lord
larkspur
miss
devereux
this
is
very
immature
even
if
you
are
quite
clear
as
to
which
side
of
the
stage
is
and
which
is
you
make
the
evolutions
seem
natural
thus
from
the
miss
devereux
stops
in
surprise
at
lord
arthur
holds
out
her
why
lord
arthur
whatever
how
do
i
just
run
down
to
tell
lord
larkspur
to
he
in
the
library
at
least
he
a
taking
out
his
ah
then
perhaps
i
better
by
door
on
lady
have
you
seen
the
times
about
here
there
is
a
set
of
verses
in
the
financial
supplement
which
lord
larkspur
wanted
to
wanders
vaguely
round
the
room
lord
larkspur
door
at
why
here
you
are
i
just
sent
lord
arthur
into
the
library
to
i
went
out
to
speak
to
the
gardener
about
ah
then
i
go
and
tell
arthur
exit
to
library
miss
devereux
lord
larkspur
and
there
you
are
you
will
of
course
appreciate
that
the
unfinished
sentences
not
only
save
time
but
also
make
the
manoeuvring
very
much
more
natural
so
far
i
have
been
writing
as
if
you
were
already
in
the
thick
of
your
play
but
it
may
well
be
that
the
enormous
difficulty
of
getting
the
first
character
on
has
been
too
much
for
you
how
you
may
be
wondering
are
you
to
begin
your
masterpiece
the
answer
to
this
will
depend
upon
the
length
of
the
play
for
upon
the
length
depends
the
hour
at
which
the
curtain
rises
if
yours
is
an
play
you
may
be
sure
that
the
stalls
will
not
fill
up
till
and
you
should
therefore
let
loose
the
members
of
the
cast
on
the
opening
scene
keeping
your
in
reserve
in
an
play
the
audience
may
be
plunged
into
the
drama
at
once
but
this
is
much
the
more
difficult
thing
to
do
and
for
the
beginner
i
should
certainly
recommend
the
play
for
which
the
recipe
is
simple
as
soon
as
the
lights
go
down
and
while
the
bald
stout
gentleman
is
kicking
our
out
of
his
way
treading
heavily
on
our
toes
and
wheezing
sorry
sorry
as
he
struggles
to
his
seat
a
buzz
begins
behind
the
curtain
what
the
players
are
saying
is
not
distinguishable
but
a
merry
girlish
laugh
rings
out
now
and
then
followed
by
the
short
sardonic
chuckle
of
an
obvious
man
of
the
world
then
the
curtain
rises
and
it
is
apparent
that
we
are
assisting
at
an
at
home
of
considerable
splendour
most
of
the
characters
seem
to
be
on
the
stage
and
for
once
we
do
not
ask
how
they
got
there
we
presume
they
have
all
been
invited
thus
you
have
had
no
difficulty
with
your
entrances
the
chatter
dies
down
a
chord
is
struck
on
the
bishop
of
charming
quite
one
of
my
favourites
do
play
it
again
relapses
into
silence
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
duchess
of
southbridge
lord
reggie
oh
reggie
what
you
say
reggie
putting
up
his
eyeglass
said
i
bally
well
what
evangeline
lady
violet
as
walk
across
the
stage
oh
i
tell
you
what
that
funny
danby
said
lady
violet
the
less
trills
with
happy
laughter
von
ichdien
the
ambassador
loudly
to
an
unnamed
gentleman
what
your
country
ought
to
do
he
finishes
his
remarks
in
the
which
the
unnamed
gentleman
seems
to
understand
at
any
rate
he
nods
several
times
is
more
girlish
laughter
more
buzz
and
more
language
well
what
about
auction
murmurs
you
play
auction
archbishop
crowd
drifts
off
leaving
the
hero
and
heroine
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
and
then
you
can
begin
but
now
i
must
give
you
a
warning
you
will
never
be
a
dramatist
until
you
have
learnt
the
technique
of
meals
in
spite
of
all
you
can
do
in
the
way
of
avoiding
soililoquies
and
getting
your
characters
on
and
off
the
stage
in
a
dramatic
manner
a
time
will
come
when
you
realize
sadly
that
your
play
is
not
a
bit
like
life
after
all
then
is
the
time
to
introduce
a
meal
on
the
stage
a
stage
meal
is
popular
because
it
proves
to
the
audience
that
the
actors
even
when
called
charles
hawtrey
or
owen
nares
are
real
people
just
like
you
and
me
look
at
bourchier
eating
we
say
excitedly
to
each
other
in
the
pit
having
had
a
vague
idea
up
till
then
that
an
actor
lived
like
a
god
on
praise
and
greasepaint
and
his
photograph
in
the
papers
another
cup
wo
you
says
miss
gladys
cooper
no
thank
you
says
dennis
eadie
dash
it
it
exactly
what
we
do
at
home
ourselves
and
when
to
clinch
matters
the
dramatist
makes
gerald
du
maurier
light
a
real
cigarette
in
the
third
act
then
he
can
flatter
himself
that
he
has
indeed
achieved
the
ambition
of
every
stage
writer
and
brought
the
actual
scent
of
the
hay
across
the
footlights
but
there
is
a
technique
to
be
acquired
in
this
matter
as
in
everything
else
within
the
theatre
the
great
art
of
the
as
i
have
already
shown
is
to
seem
natural
rather
than
to
be
natural
let
your
actors
have
tea
by
all
means
but
see
that
it
is
a
properly
histrionic
tea
this
is
how
it
should
go
how
do
you
do
you
have
some
tea
wo
you
rings
bell
thank
you
butler
tea
please
matthews
impassively
yes
this
is
all
he
says
during
the
play
so
he
must
try
and
get
a
little
character
into
it
in
order
the
era
remark
thompson
was
excellent
matthews
his
part
is
not
over
yet
for
he
returns
immediately
followed
by
three
footmen
just
as
it
happened
when
you
last
called
on
duchess
sets
out
the
tea
holding
up
the
property
lump
of
sugar
in
the
tongs
sugar
luckily
no
thanks
replaces
lump
and
inclines
empty
teapot
over
tray
for
a
moment
then
hands
him
a
cup
painted
brown
inside
thus
deceiving
the
gentleman
with
the
telescope
in
the
upper
touching
his
lips
with
the
cup
and
then
returning
it
to
its
saucer
well
i
must
be
going
butler
footmen
remove
the
guest
so
glad
you
could
come
guest
his
visit
has
been
short
but
it
has
been
very
thrilling
while
it
lasted
tea
is
the
most
usual
meal
on
the
stage
for
the
reason
that
it
is
the
least
expensive
the
property
lump
of
sugar
being
dusted
and
used
again
on
the
next
night
for
a
stage
dinner
a
certain
amount
of
genuine
has
to
be
made
up
to
look
like
fish
chicken
or
cutlet
in
novels
the
hero
has
often
pushed
his
meals
away
untasted
but
no
stage
hero
would
do
anything
so
unnatural
as
this
the
etiquette
is
to
have
two
bites
before
the
butler
and
the
three
footmen
whisk
away
the
plate
two
bites
are
made
and
the
bread
is
crumbled
with
an
air
of
great
eagerness
indeed
one
feels
that
in
real
life
the
guest
would
clutch
hold
of
the
footman
and
say
half
a
mo
old
chap
i
have
finished
but
the
actor
is
better
schooled
than
this
besides
the
thing
is
coming
back
again
as
chicken
directly
but
it
is
the
cigarette
which
chiefly
has
brought
the
modern
drama
to
its
present
state
of
perfection
without
the
stage
cigarette
many
an
epigram
would
pass
unnoticed
many
an
actor
hands
would
be
much
more
noticeable
and
the
man
who
works
the
fireproof
safety
curtain
would
lose
even
the
small
amount
of
excitement
which
at
present
attaches
to
his
job
now
although
it
is
possible
in
the
case
of
a
few
men
at
the
top
of
the
profession
to
leave
the
conduct
of
the
cigarette
entirely
to
the
actor
you
will
find
it
much
more
satisfactory
to
insert
in
the
stage
directions
the
particular
movements
with
match
and
so
forth
that
you
wish
carried
out
let
us
assume
that
lord
arthur
asks
lord
john
what
a
cynic
is
the
question
of
what
a
cynic
is
having
arisen
quite
naturally
in
the
course
of
the
plot
let
us
assume
further
that
you
wish
lord
john
to
reply
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
knows
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing
it
has
been
said
before
but
you
may
feel
that
it
is
quite
time
it
was
said
again
besides
for
all
the
audience
knows
lord
john
may
simply
be
quoting
now
this
answer
even
if
it
comes
quite
fresh
to
the
stalls
will
lose
much
of
its
effect
if
it
is
said
without
the
assistance
of
a
cigarette
try
it
for
yourself
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
etc
rotten
now
try
again
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
etc
lights
cigarette
no
even
that
is
not
good
once
more
john
lighting
cigarette
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
etc
better
but
leaves
too
much
to
the
actor
well
i
see
i
must
tell
you
john
taking
out
gold
cigarette
case
from
his
upper
waistcoat
pocket
a
cynic
my
dear
arthur
opens
case
deliberately
puts
cigarette
in
mouth
and
extracts
gold
from
is
a
man
who
knows
the
price
of
everything
and
with
match
in
one
hand
and
cigarette
in
the
the
value
of
out
of
deeply
from
cigarette
and
blows
out
a
cloud
of
nothing
it
makes
a
different
thing
of
it
altogether
of
course
on
the
actual
night
the
match
may
refuse
to
strike
and
lord
john
may
have
to
go
on
saying
a
man
who
a
man
who
a
man
who
until
the
ignition
occurs
but
even
so
it
will
still
seem
delightfully
natural
to
the
audience
as
if
he
were
making
up
the
epigram
as
he
went
along
while
as
for
blowing
the
match
out
he
can
hardly
fail
to
do
in
one
the
cigarette
of
course
will
be
smoked
at
other
moments
than
epigrammatic
ones
but
on
these
other
occasions
you
will
not
need
to
deal
so
fully
with
it
in
the
stage
directions
lighting
i
trust
perkins
that
is
enough
you
do
not
want
to
say
dropping
ash
on
it
seems
to
me
my
love
or
removing
stray
piece
of
tobacco
from
what
ireland
needs
is
still
less
throwing
away
end
of
show
him
in
for
this
must
remain
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
stage
what
happens
to
the
stage
cigarette
when
it
has
been
puffed
four
times
the
stage
tea
of
which
a
second
cup
is
always
refused
the
stage
cutlet
which
is
removed
with
the
connivance
of
the
guest
after
two
mouthfuls
the
stage
cigarette
which
nobody
ever
seems
to
want
to
smoke
to
the
end
thinking
of
these
as
they
make
their
appearances
in
the
houses
of
the
titled
one
would
say
that
the
hospitality
of
the
peerage
was
not
a
thing
to
make
any
great
rush
for
but
that
would
be
to
forget
the
butler
and
the
three
footmen
even
a
duke
can
not
have
everything
and
what
his
may
lack
in
skill
his
butler
more
than
makes
up
for
in
impassivity
a
poetry
recital
it
has
always
been
the
privilege
of
art
to
be
patronized
by
wealth
and
rank
indeed
if
we
literary
and
artistic
strugglers
were
not
asked
out
to
afternoon
tea
sometimes
by
our
millionaire
acquaintances
it
is
doubtful
if
we
should
be
able
to
continue
the
struggle
recently
a
new
and
less
expensive
method
of
entertaining
genius
has
become
fashionable
in
the
best
circles
and
the
aspiring
poet
is
now
invited
to
the
house
of
the
great
not
for
the
purpose
of
partaking
of
bodily
refreshment
himself
but
in
order
that
he
may
afford
spiritual
refreshment
to
others
in
short
he
is
given
an
opportunity
of
reciting
his
own
works
in
front
of
the
fair
the
rich
and
the
highly
born
and
making
what
he
can
out
of
it
in
the
way
of
advertisement
let
us
imagine
that
we
have
been
lucky
enough
to
secure
an
invitation
to
one
of
lady
poldoodle
poetry
at
her
charming
little
house
in
berkeley
square
the
guests
are
all
waiting
their
eyes
fixed
in
eager
anticipation
on
the
throne
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
whereon
each
poet
will
sit
to
declaim
his
masterpiece
when
suddenly
lord
poldoodle
is
observed
to
be
making
his
way
cautiously
towards
a
fortunately
he
is
stopped
in
time
and
dragged
back
to
his
seat
next
to
the
throne
from
which
he
rises
a
moment
later
to
open
the
proceeding
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
says
we
are
met
here
this
afternoon
in
order
to
listen
to
some
of
our
younger
poets
who
will
recite
from
their
own
works
so
far
i
have
always
managed
to
avoid
so
far
i
have
been
unavoidably
prevented
from
attending
on
these
occasions
but
i
understand
that
the
procedure
is
as
follows
each
poet
will
recite
a
short
sample
of
his
poetry
after
which
no
doubt
you
will
go
home
and
order
from
your
bookseller
a
complete
set
of
his
works
lady
poldoodle
goes
quickly
over
to
him
and
whispers
vigorously
i
find
i
am
wrong
says
our
host
full
sets
of
the
works
can
be
obtained
on
the
way
out
there
is
however
no
compulsion
in
the
matter
and
if
you
take
my
advice
well
well
let
us
get
on
our
first
poet
here
he
puts
on
his
glasses
and
reads
from
a
paper
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
is
sydney
worple
of
whom
you
er
have
er
doubtless
all
heard
at
any
rate
you
will
hear
him
now
sydney
worple
tall
and
thin
wearing
the
sort
of
tie
which
makes
you
think
you
must
have
seen
him
before
steps
forward
amidst
applause
he
falls
back
into
the
throne
as
if
deep
in
thought
and
passes
a
hand
across
his
hair
worple
dawn
at
surbiton
where
says
a
frightened
voice
at
the
back
says
lady
poldoodle
in
a
whisper
surbiton
surbiton
is
passed
round
the
back
seats
not
that
it
is
going
to
matter
in
the
least
worple
repeats
the
title
and
then
recites
in
an
intense
voice
these
lines
out
of
the
nethermost
bonds
of
night
out
of
the
gloom
where
the
bats
wings
brush
me
free
from
the
crepitous
doubts
which
crush
me
forth
i
fare
to
the
cool
sunlight
forth
to
a
world
where
the
wind
sweeps
clean
where
the
ash
to
the
blue
stands
bare
and
the
gossamer
spreads
her
opalled
ware
and
jones
is
catching
the
after
several
more
verses
like
this
he
bows
and
retires
lady
poldoodle
still
mechanically
clapping
says
to
her
neighbour
how
beautiful
dawn
at
surbiton
such
a
beautiful
idea
i
think
was
it
sublime
answers
the
neighbour
the
wonderful
contrast
between
the
great
pageant
of
nature
and
poor
jones
catching
always
catching
the
but
lord
poldoodle
is
rising
again
our
next
poet
he
says
is
miss
miranda
herrick
whose
work
is
so
distinguished
for
its
er
its
er
distinction
miss
herrick
dressed
in
pale
green
and
wearing
pincenez
flutters
in
girlishly
she
gives
a
nervous
little
giggle
pushes
out
her
foot
withdraws
it
and
begins
when
i
take
my
bath
in
the
morning
the
audience
wakes
up
with
a
start
when
you
take
your
says
lord
poldoodle
miss
herrick
begins
again
starting
this
time
with
the
title
life
when
i
take
my
bath
in
the
morning
when
i
strip
for
the
cool
delight
and
the
housemaid
brings
me
towels
and
things
do
i
reck
of
the
coming
night
a
man
whispers
to
his
neighbour
that
always
wonders
what
for
breakfast
she
says
for
there
is
another
verse
to
come
when
my
hair
comes
down
in
the
evening
and
my
tired
clothes
swoon
to
the
ground
do
i
bother
my
head
as
i
leap
in
bed
of
the
truth
which
the
dawn
brings
round
in
the
uncomfortable
pause
which
follows
a
voice
is
heard
saying
does
she
and
lady
poldoodle
asks
kindly
is
that
all
dear
what
more
could
there
be
says
miss
herrick
with
a
sigh
what
more
is
there
to
say
it
is
life
life
how
true
says
the
hostess
but
wo
you
give
us
something
else
that
one
ended
so
very
suddenly
after
much
inward
and
outward
wrestling
miss
herrick
announces
a
thought
the
music
falls
across
the
vale
from
nightingale
to
nightingale
the
owl
within
the
ivied
tree
makes
love
to
me
makes
love
to
me
but
all
the
tadpoles
in
the
pond
are
dumb
however
fond
i
begin
to
think
that
there
is
something
in
a
tadpole
after
all
murmurs
lord
poldoodle
to
himself
as
the
author
wriggles
her
way
out
after
all
says
one
guest
to
another
why
should
a
tadpole
make
love
as
much
as
anybody
else
i
think
says
her
neighbour
that
the
idea
is
of
youth
trying
vainly
to
express
itself
or
am
i
thinking
of
caterpillars
lord
poldoodle
what
is
a
tadpole
exactly
a
tadpole
he
answers
decisively
is
an
extremely
immature
wriggling
creature
which
is
quite
rightly
dumb
now
steps
forward
horatio
bullfinch
full
of
simple
enthusiasm
one
of
the
london
school
he
gives
us
his
famous
poem
berkeley
square
the
men
who
come
from
the
north
country
are
tall
and
very
fair
the
men
who
come
from
the
south
country
have
hardly
any
hair
but
the
only
men
in
the
world
for
me
are
the
men
of
berkeley
square
the
sun
may
shine
at
colchester
the
rain
may
rain
at
penge
from
skies
the
dawn
may
rise
broodingly
on
stonehenge
in
clover
the
lambs
at
dover
nibble
awhile
and
stare
but
there
only
one
place
in
the
world
for
me
berkeley
berkeley
square
and
so
on
down
to
that
magnificent
last
verse
the
skylark
triumphs
from
the
blue
above
the
barley
fields
at
loo
the
blackbird
whistles
loud
and
clear
upon
the
hills
at
windermere
but
oh
i
simply
love
the
way
our
plays
all
day
lord
poldoodle
rises
to
introduce
montagu
mott
mott
he
says
is
i
am
told
our
leading
exponent
of
what
is
called
which
means
well
you
will
see
what
it
means
directly
mott
a
very
ugly
little
man
who
tries
to
give
you
the
impression
that
he
is
being
ugly
on
purpose
and
could
easily
be
beautiful
if
he
were
not
above
all
that
sort
of
thing
announces
the
title
of
his
masterpiece
it
is
called
why
is
the
fat
woman
face
so
red
well
what
else
you
call
it
why
is
the
fat
woman
face
so
red
is
it
because
her
stays
are
too
tight
or
because
she
wants
to
sneeze
and
has
lost
her
pocket
handkerchief
or
only
because
her
second
son
the
engineer
is
dying
of
cancer
i
can
not
be
certain
yet
i
sit
here
and
ask
myself
wonderingly
why
is
the
fat
woman
face
so
red
it
is
generally
recognized
that
in
mott
we
have
a
real
poet
there
are
loud
cries
of
encore
mott
shakes
his
head
i
have
written
no
more
he
says
in
a
deep
voice
i
have
given
you
the
result
of
three
years
work
perhaps
in
another
three
years
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
walks
gloomingly
out
such
a
sweet
idea
says
lady
poldoodle
i
sit
here
and
ask
myself
wonderingly
how
true
how
very
true
i
could
quite
follow
it
dear
says
her
neighbour
frankly
did
he
marry
her
after
all
lord
poldoodle
looking
slightly
more
cheerful
gets
once
more
on
to
his
legs
you
will
all
be
very
glad
to
hear
ah
you
will
all
be
sorry
to
hear
that
we
have
only
one
more
poet
on
our
list
this
afternoon
cecil
willow
the
er
poet
willow
a
young
man
fair
and
rather
stout
and
a
credit
to
any
announces
the
subject
of
his
poem
liberty
liberty
what
crimes
have
been
committed
in
thy
name
murmurs
lord
poldoodle
to
himself
liberty
there
were
two
thrushes
in
a
tree
the
one
was
tamed
the
other
free
because
his
wings
were
clipped
so
small
the
tame
one
did
not
fly
at
all
but
sang
to
heaven
all
the
day
the
other
shortly
after
flew
away
there
were
two
women
in
a
town
the
one
was
blonde
the
other
brown
the
brown
one
pleased
a
viscount
son
not
richard
but
the
other
one
he
gave
her
a
delightful
flat
the
blonde
one
loved
a
man
called
alfred
spratt
there
were
two
kings
on
thrones
of
gold
the
one
was
young
the
other
old
the
young
one
laws
were
wisely
made
till
someone
took
a
and
threw
it
shouting
down
with
kings
the
old
one
laid
foundation
stones
and
things
how
delightful
says
everybody
how
very
delightful
thank
you
lady
poldoodle
for
such
a
delightful
afternoon
the
perils
of
reviewing
a
most
unfortunate
thing
has
happened
to
a
friend
of
mine
called
to
a
friend
of
to
a
well
i
suppose
the
truth
will
have
to
come
out
it
happened
to
me
only
do
tell
anybody
i
reviewed
a
book
the
other
day
it
is
not
often
i
do
this
because
before
one
can
review
a
book
one
has
to
or
is
supposed
to
read
it
which
wastes
a
good
deal
of
time
even
that
is
an
end
of
the
trouble
the
article
which
follows
is
not
really
one
own
for
the
wretched
fellow
who
wrote
the
book
is
always
trying
to
push
his
way
in
with
his
views
on
matrimony
or
the
sussex
downs
or
whatever
his
ridiculous
subject
is
he
expects
one
to
say
blank
treatment
of
relations
with
her
husband
is
masterly
whereas
what
one
wants
to
say
is
putting
blank
book
on
one
side
we
may
consider
the
larger
question
whether
and
so
consider
it
alone
to
the
end
of
the
column
well
i
reviewed
blank
book
rotundity
as
i
expected
the
first
draft
had
to
be
a
corner
of
old
london
and
used
elsewhere
blank
did
get
into
it
at
all
i
kept
promising
myself
a
sentence
take
for
instance
the
new
novel
by
william
blank
which
etc
but
before
i
was
ready
for
it
the
article
was
finished
in
my
second
draft
realizing
the
dangers
of
delay
i
began
at
once
this
remarkable
novel
and
continued
so
for
a
couple
of
sentences
but
on
reading
it
through
afterwards
i
saw
at
once
that
the
first
two
sentences
were
out
of
place
in
an
article
that
obviously
ought
to
be
called
the
last
swallow
so
i
cut
them
out
sent
the
last
swallow
a
reverie
to
another
editor
and
began
again
the
third
time
i
was
successful
of
course
in
my
review
i
said
all
the
usual
things
i
said
that
blank
attitude
to
life
was
subjective
rather
than
objective
and
a
little
lower
down
that
it
was
objective
rather
than
subjective
i
pointed
out
that
in
his
treatment
of
the
major
theme
he
was
a
but
i
suggested
that
on
the
other
hand
he
had
nothing
to
learn
from
the
russians
or
the
russians
had
nothing
to
learn
from
him
i
forget
which
and
finally
i
said
and
this
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
that
antoine
vaurelle
classic
and
i
looked
it
up
in
the
encyclopedia
classic
je
comprends
tout
had
been
not
without
its
influence
on
blank
it
was
a
good
review
and
the
editor
was
pleased
about
it
a
few
days
later
blank
wrote
to
say
that
curiously
enough
he
had
never
read
je
comprends
tout
it
did
seem
to
me
very
curious
because
i
had
never
read
it
either
but
i
thought
it
rather
odd
of
him
to
confess
as
much
to
a
stranger
the
only
book
of
vaurelle
which
i
had
read
was
consolatrice
in
an
english
translation
however
one
say
these
things
in
a
review
now
i
have
a
french
friend
henri
one
of
those
annoying
frenchmen
who
talk
english
much
better
than
i
do
and
henri
for
some
extraordinary
reason
had
seen
my
review
he
has
to
live
in
london
now
but
his
heart
is
in
paris
and
i
imagine
that
every
word
of
his
beloved
language
which
appears
however
casually
in
an
english
paper
mysteriously
catches
his
eye
and
brings
the
scent
and
sounds
of
the
boulevards
to
him
across
the
so
the
next
time
i
met
him
he
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
and
told
me
how
glad
he
was
that
i
was
an
admirer
of
antoine
novels
who
is
i
said
with
a
shrug
and
to
get
the
conversation
on
to
safer
ground
i
added
hastily
that
in
some
ways
i
almost
liked
consolatrice
best
he
shook
my
hand
again
so
did
he
a
great
book
but
of
course
he
said
one
must
read
it
in
the
original
french
it
is
the
book
of
all
others
which
loses
by
translation
of
course
i
agreed
really
i
do
see
what
else
i
could
have
done
do
you
remember
that
wonderful
phrase
and
he
rattled
it
off
magnificent
is
it
not
magnificent
i
said
remembering
an
appointment
instead
well
i
must
be
getting
on
and
as
i
walked
off
i
patted
my
forehead
with
my
handkerchief
and
wondered
why
the
day
had
grown
so
warm
suddenly
however
the
next
day
was
even
warmer
henri
came
to
see
me
with
a
book
under
his
arm
we
all
have
one
special
book
of
our
own
which
we
recommend
to
our
acquaintances
regarding
the
love
of
it
as
perhaps
the
best
passport
to
our
friendship
this
was
henri
he
was
about
to
test
me
i
had
read
and
admired
his
favourite
vaurelle
in
the
original
french
would
i
love
his
darling
laforgue
my
reputation
as
a
man
as
a
writer
as
a
critic
depended
on
it
he
handed
me
the
book
in
french
it
is
all
there
he
said
reverently
as
he
gave
it
to
me
all
your
english
masters
they
all
come
from
him
perhaps
most
of
all
your
but
you
shall
tell
me
when
you
have
read
it
you
shall
tell
me
whom
most
you
seem
to
see
there
your
meredith
your
shaw
your
but
you
shall
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
i
said
faintly
and
i
got
to
tell
him
do
think
that
i
shall
have
any
difficulty
in
reading
the
book
glancing
through
it
just
now
i
came
across
this
soupé
avant
le
je
guère
le
coeur
à
well
that
easy
enough
but
i
doubt
if
it
is
one
of
the
most
characteristic
passages
it
does
give
you
a
clue
to
laforgue
manner
any
more
than
i
sit
here
mother
without
a
doubt
you
must
tells
you
all
that
you
want
to
know
about
meredith
there
more
in
it
than
that
and
i
got
to
tell
him
but
fancy
holding
forth
on
an
author
style
after
reading
him
laboriously
with
a
dictionary
however
i
must
do
my
best
and
in
my
more
hopeful
moments
i
see
the
conversation
going
like
this
well
oh
wonderful
really
wonderful
you
see
them
all
there
yes
yes
it
really
wonderful
meredith
i
mean
well
simply
a
wonderful
you
see
meredith
there
most
sometimes
and
then
sometimes
i
i
do
difficult
to
say
sometimes
i
er
shaw
er
well
it
a
gesture
somewhat
how
can
i
put
it
not
thackeray
at
all
he
says
watching
me
eagerly
i
decide
to
risk
it
oh
but
of
course
i
mean
thackeray
when
i
said
meredith
i
was
thinking
of
the
but
thackeray
i
mean
thackeray
er
forgotten
the
author
name
for
the
moment
and
go
on
i
mean
er
thackeray
obviously
he
shakes
me
by
the
hand
i
am
his
friend
but
this
conversation
only
takes
place
in
my
more
hopeful
moments
in
my
less
hopeful
ones
i
see
myself
going
into
the
country
for
quite
a
long
time
iii
summer
days
a
song
for
the
summer
it
never
mind
think
how
much
the
birdies
love
it
see
them
in
their
dozens
drawn
dancing
to
the
croquet
lawn
could
our
little
friends
have
dined
if
there
been
no
worms
above
it
it
what
of
that
if
the
owls
are
fairly
perky
just
imagine
you
were
one
would
you
the
sun
i
pretending
i
a
bat
and
i
know
i
it
murky
it
after
all
we
must
not
forget
the
poodle
if
the
days
were
really
hot
could
he
wear
woolly
spot
could
he
even
keep
his
shawl
no
he
shave
the
whole
caboodle
the
season
prospects
the
great
question
in
the
mallory
family
just
now
is
whether
dick
will
get
into
the
eleven
this
year
confident
as
he
is
himself
he
is
taking
no
risks
we
going
to
put
the
net
up
he
said
to
me
as
soon
as
i
arrived
and
then
you
be
able
to
bowl
to
me
how
long
are
you
staying
till
i
said
quickly
rot
you
fixed
up
here
till
tuesday
any
how
my
dear
dick
i
come
down
for
a
few
days
rest
if
the
weather
permits
i
may
have
the
croquet
things
out
one
afternoon
and
try
a
round
or
possibly
i
do
believe
you
bowl
said
bobby
rudely
bobby
is
twelve
five
years
younger
than
dick
it
is
not
my
place
to
smack
head
but
might
do
it
for
him
then
that
just
shows
how
little
you
know
about
it
i
retorted
in
a
match
last
september
i
went
on
to
bowl
why
i
knew
the
captain
i
explained
well
as
i
say
he
asked
me
to
go
on
to
bowl
and
i
took
four
wickets
for
thirteen
runs
there
good
man
said
dick
was
it
against
a
girls
school
said
bobby
you
know
bobby
is
simply
for
it
it
was
not
nor
were
children
of
twelve
allowed
in
without
their
perambulators
well
anyhow
said
bobby
i
bet
phyllis
can
bowl
better
than
you
is
this
true
i
said
to
phyllis
i
asked
her
because
in
a
general
way
my
bowling
is
held
to
be
superior
to
that
of
girls
of
fifteen
of
course
she
might
be
something
special
i
can
bowl
bobby
out
she
said
modestly
i
looked
at
bobby
in
surprise
and
then
shook
my
head
sadly
you
jolly
well
shut
up
he
said
turning
indignantly
to
his
sister
just
because
you
did
it
once
when
the
sun
was
in
my
eyes
bobby
bobby
i
said
this
is
painful
hearing
let
us
be
thankful
that
we
do
have
to
play
against
girls
schools
let
us
but
bobby
was
gone
goaded
to
anger
he
had
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
made
the
general
observation
an
observation
inoffensive
enough
to
a
stranger
but
evidently
of
such
deep
private
significance
to
phyllis
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
head
a
pursuit
into
the
shrubbery
without
further
delay
the
children
are
gone
i
said
to
dick
now
we
can
discuss
the
prospects
for
the
season
in
peace
i
took
up
the
sportsman
again
i
see
that
kent
is
going
to
the
prospects
are
all
right
said
dick
if
only
i
can
get
into
form
soon
enough
last
year
i
did
get
going
till
the
end
of
june
by
the
way
what
sort
of
stuff
do
you
bowl
ordinary
sort
of
stuff
i
said
with
one
or
two
bounces
in
it
do
you
see
that
surrey
fast
or
slow
slow
that
is
you
know
when
i
bowl
at
all
i
not
quite
sure
this
season
whether
i
had
better
slow
said
dick
thoughtfully
that
really
what
i
want
i
want
lots
of
that
you
must
get
phyllis
to
bowl
to
you
i
said
with
detachment
you
know
i
should
be
surprised
if
lancashire
my
dear
man
girls
ca
bowl
she
fields
jolly
well
though
what
about
your
father
his
bowling
days
are
rather
over
he
was
in
the
eleven
you
know
thirty
years
ago
so
there
really
nobody
but
one
bowling
days
soon
get
over
i
hastened
to
agree
but
i
know
now
exactly
what
the
prospects
of
the
season
or
at
any
rate
of
the
first
week
of
it
are
mallory
the
prospects
here
are
on
the
whole
encouraging
to
dwell
upon
the
bright
side
first
there
will
be
casual
bowling
and
an
hour
and
a
half
miscellaneous
coaching
every
day
on
the
other
hand
some
of
his
best
plants
will
be
disturbed
while
there
is
more
than
a
chance
that
he
may
lose
the
services
of
a
library
window
mallory
the
prospects
here
are
much
as
last
year
except
that
her
youngest
born
joan
is
now
five
and
consequently
rather
more
likely
to
wander
in
the
way
of
a
cricket
ball
or
fall
down
in
front
of
the
roller
than
she
was
twelve
months
ago
otherwise
mallory
faces
the
approaching
season
with
calm
if
not
with
complete
appreciation
dick
of
dick
prospects
there
is
no
need
to
speak
at
length
he
will
have
two
hours
batting
every
day
against
from
a
batsman
point
of
view
ideal
bowling
and
in
addition
the
admiration
of
all
of
us
in
short
the
outlook
here
is
distinctly
hopeful
phyllis
the
prospects
of
this
player
are
from
her
own
point
of
view
bright
as
she
will
be
allowed
to
field
for
two
hours
a
day
to
the
beloved
dick
she
is
also
fully
qualified
now
to
help
with
the
heavy
roller
a
new
experiment
is
to
be
tried
this
season
and
she
will
be
allowed
to
bowl
for
an
odd
at
the
end
of
dick
innings
to
bobby
enters
upon
the
coming
season
with
confidence
as
he
thinks
there
is
a
chance
of
my
bowling
to
him
too
but
he
is
mistaken
as
before
he
will
be
in
charge
of
the
heavy
roller
and
he
will
also
be
required
to
slacken
the
ropes
of
the
net
at
the
end
of
the
day
his
prospects
however
are
certainly
improved
this
season
as
he
will
be
qualified
to
bowl
for
the
whole
two
hours
but
only
on
the
distinct
understanding
with
phyllis
that
he
does
his
own
fielding
for
himself
of
the
prospects
of
joan
i
have
already
spoken
above
there
remain
only
the
prospects
of
myself
which
are
frankly
rotten
they
consist
chiefly
of
two
hours
bowling
to
the
batting
of
dick
who
hits
them
back
very
hard
and
ten
batting
to
the
bowling
of
phyllis
slow
mild
and
bobby
fast
wides
for
dick
having
been
ordered
by
the
captain
not
to
strain
himself
by
trying
to
bowl
is
not
going
to
try
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
bobby
will
approve
of
my
action
while
if
he
or
phyllis
should
by
an
unlucky
accident
get
me
out
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
in
this
case
however
there
must
be
added
to
bobby
prospects
the
possibility
of
getting
his
head
definitely
smacked
fortunately
it
is
my
only
consolation
the
season
will
be
a
short
one
it
ends
on
tuesday
the
first
game
there
comes
a
day
i
can
hear
it
coming
one
of
those
glorious
deep
blue
days
when
larks
are
singing
and
bees
are
humming
and
earth
gives
voice
in
a
thousand
ways
then
i
my
friends
i
too
shall
sing
and
hum
a
foolish
little
thing
and
whistle
like
but
not
too
like
a
blackbird
in
the
spring
there
looms
a
day
i
can
feel
it
looming
yes
it
will
be
in
a
month
or
less
when
all
the
flowers
in
the
world
are
blooming
and
nature
flutters
her
fairest
dress
then
i
my
friends
i
too
shall
wear
a
blazer
that
will
make
them
stare
and
brush
this
is
official
i
shall
also
brush
my
hair
it
is
the
day
that
i
watch
for
yearly
never
before
has
it
come
so
late
but
now
i
only
a
month
no
merely
a
couple
of
fortnights
left
to
wait
and
then
to
make
the
matter
plain
i
hold
at
last
a
bat
again
dear
hobbs
the
weeks
this
summer
think
the
i
lived
in
vain
i
see
already
the
first
ball
twisting
over
the
green
as
i
take
my
stand
i
hear
already
insisting
it
was
a
chance
that
came
to
hand
or
no
i
see
it
miss
the
bat
and
strike
me
on
the
knee
whereat
some
fool
some
silly
fool
at
point
says
blandly
how
was
that
then
scouting
later
i
hold
a
at
deep
from
the
local
fry
and
at
short
to
the
village
scotton
i
snap
a
skimmer
some
six
foot
high
or
else
perhaps
i
get
the
ball
upon
the
thumb
or
not
at
all
or
right
into
the
hands
and
then
lorblessme
let
it
fall
but
what
care
i
it
the
game
that
calls
me
simply
to
be
on
the
field
of
play
how
can
it
matter
what
fate
befalls
me
with
ten
good
fellows
and
one
good
day
but
still
i
rather
hope
spectators
will
observing
any
lack
or
skill
remark
this
is
his
first
appearance
yes
i
they
will
the
competition
spirit
about
six
weeks
ago
a
canadian
gentleman
named
smith
arrived
in
the
old
country
england
he
knew
a
man
who
knew
a
man
who
knew
a
man
and
so
on
for
a
bit
who
knew
a
man
who
knew
a
man
who
knew
me
letters
passed
negotiations
ensued
and
about
a
week
after
he
had
first
set
foot
in
the
mother
city
london
smith
and
i
met
at
my
club
for
lunch
i
may
confess
now
that
i
was
nervous
i
think
i
expected
a
man
in
a
brown
shirt
and
leggings
who
would
ask
me
to
put
it
right
there
and
tell
me
i
was
some
englishman
however
he
turned
out
to
be
exactly
like
anybody
else
in
london
whether
he
found
me
exactly
like
anybody
else
in
canada
i
do
know
anyway
we
had
a
very
pleasant
lunch
and
arranged
to
play
golf
together
on
the
next
day
whatever
else
is
true
of
canada
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
turns
out
delightful
golfers
smith
proved
to
be
just
the
best
golfer
i
had
ever
met
being
when
at
the
top
of
his
form
almost
exactly
as
good
as
i
was
hole
after
hole
we
halved
in
a
mechanical
eight
if
by
means
of
a
raking
drive
and
four
perfect
brassies
at
the
sixth
he
managed
to
get
one
up
for
a
moment
then
at
the
short
seventh
a
screaming
iron
and
three
consummate
approaches
would
make
me
square
again
occasionally
he
would
by
superhuman
play
do
a
hole
in
bogey
but
only
to
crack
at
the
next
and
leave
me
at
the
edge
of
the
green
to
play
one
off
eleven
it
was
in
fact
a
struggle
all
the
way
and
for
his
victory
in
the
morning
i
had
my
revenge
with
a
victory
in
the
afternoon
by
the
end
of
a
month
we
must
have
played
a
dozen
rounds
of
this
nature
i
always
had
a
feeling
that
i
was
really
a
better
golfer
than
he
and
this
made
me
friendly
towards
his
game
i
would
concede
him
short
putts
which
i
should
have
had
no
difficulty
in
missing
myself
if
he
lost
his
ball
i
would
beg
him
to
drop
another
and
go
on
with
the
hole
if
he
got
into
a
bad
place
in
a
bunker
i
would
assure
him
it
was
ground
under
repair
he
was
just
as
friendly
in
refusing
to
take
these
advantages
just
as
pleasant
in
offering
similar
indulgences
to
me
i
thought
at
first
it
was
part
of
his
sporting
way
but
it
turned
out
that
absurdly
enough
he
also
was
convinced
that
he
was
really
the
better
golfer
of
the
two
and
could
afford
these
amenities
one
day
he
announced
that
he
was
going
back
to
canada
we
must
have
a
last
game
he
said
and
this
one
must
be
decisive
for
the
championship
of
the
empire
i
agreed
let
buy
a
little
cup
and
play
for
it
i
never
won
anything
at
golf
yet
and
i
should
love
to
see
a
little
cup
on
the
every
night
you
ca
come
to
dinner
in
canada
night
he
pointed
out
it
would
be
so
expensive
for
you
well
the
cup
was
bought
engraved
the
empire
challenge
cup
and
played
for
last
monday
this
said
smith
is
a
serious
game
and
we
must
play
all
out
no
giving
away
anything
no
waiving
the
rules
the
empire
is
at
stake
the
effeteness
of
the
mother
country
is
about
to
be
put
to
the
proof
proceed
it
was
the
most
pleasant
of
our
games
the
spirit
of
the
cup
hung
over
it
and
depressed
us
at
the
third
hole
i
had
an
putt
for
a
half
that
all
right
said
smith
forgetfully
and
then
added
perhaps
you
better
put
it
in
though
of
course
i
missed
on
the
fifth
green
he
was
about
to
brush
away
a
leaf
that
illegal
i
said
sharply
you
must
pick
it
up
you
may
brush
it
away
and
after
a
fierce
argument
on
the
point
he
putted
hastily
and
badly
at
the
eighteenth
tee
we
were
all
square
and
hardly
on
speaking
terms
the
fate
of
the
mother
country
depended
upon
the
result
of
this
hole
i
drove
a
long
one
the
longest
of
the
day
slightly
hooked
good
shot
said
smith
with
an
effort
he
pressed
and
foozled
badly
i
tried
not
to
look
pleased
we
found
his
ball
in
a
thick
clump
of
heather
with
a
grim
look
on
his
face
he
took
out
his
niblick
i
stayed
by
him
and
helped
him
count
up
to
eight
where
your
ball
he
growled
a
long
way
on
i
said
reproachfully
i
wish
you
hurry
up
the
poor
thing
will
be
getting
cold
he
got
to
work
again
we
had
another
count
together
up
to
fifteen
sometimes
there
would
be
a
gleam
of
white
at
the
top
of
the
heather
for
a
moment
and
then
it
would
fade
away
how
many
i
asked
some
minutes
later
about
thirty
but
i
do
care
i
going
to
get
the
little
beast
into
the
hole
if
it
takes
me
all
night
he
went
on
hacking
i
had
lost
interest
in
the
performance
for
the
cup
was
mine
but
i
did
admire
his
colonial
grit
got
it
he
cried
suddenly
and
the
ball
sailed
out
on
to
the
pretty
another
shot
put
him
level
with
me
i
asked
about
he
said
coldly
i
began
to
look
for
my
ball
it
had
got
tired
of
waiting
and
had
hidden
itself
smith
joined
gloomily
in
the
search
this
is
absurd
i
said
after
three
or
four
minutes
by
jove
said
smith
suddenly
brightening
up
if
your
ball
lost
i
win
after
all
nonsense
you
given
the
hole
up
i
protested
you
do
know
how
many
you
played
according
to
the
rules
if
i
ask
you
how
many
and
you
give
wrong
information
it
he
said
promptly
i
do
believe
you
counted
call
it
then
there
nothing
to
prevent
my
calling
it
more
than
it
really
is
if
it
was
really
only
forty
then
i
counting
five
occasions
when
the
ball
rolled
over
as
i
was
addressing
it
that
very
generous
of
me
actually
i
doubtful
if
the
ball
did
roll
over
five
times
but
i
say
it
did
in
order
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
if
you
do
find
your
ball
in
thirty
seconds
you
lose
the
hole
it
was
ingenious
but
the
mother
country
can
be
ingenious
too
how
many
have
you
played
exactly
i
asked
be
careful
he
said
exactly
right
i
took
my
niblick
and
swung
at
the
heather
bother
i
said
missed
it
two
hallo
have
you
found
it
i
have
it
somewhere
in
this
field
there
no
rule
which
insists
that
you
shall
hit
the
ball
or
even
that
you
shall
hit
near
the
ball
or
even
that
you
shall
see
the
ball
when
you
hit
at
it
lots
of
old
gentlemen
shut
their
eyes
and
miss
the
sphere
i
missed
in
five
minutes
i
shall
miss
again
but
what
the
point
the
point
dear
friend
i
smiled
is
that
after
each
stroke
one
is
allowed
five
minutes
in
which
to
find
the
ball
i
have
strokes
in
hand
that
gives
me
three
hours
and
minutes
in
which
to
look
for
it
at
regular
intervals
of
five
minutes
i
shall
swing
my
club
and
probably
miss
it
now
at
eight
unless
i
find
my
ball
before
i
shall
be
playing
the
like
and
if
you
are
a
sportsman
i
added
you
will
bring
me
out
some
tea
in
half
an
hour
at
i
was
still
looking
and
swinging
smith
then
came
to
terms
and
agreed
to
share
the
cup
with
me
for
the
first
year
he
goes
back
to
canada
and
will
spread
the
good
news
there
that
the
old
country
can
still
hold
its
own
in
resource
determination
and
staying
power
but
next
year
we
are
going
to
play
friendly
golf

little
days
in
which

caddie
give

my
driver
caddie

day

here
is
the
day
to
seize
yes
that

jiggered
and
likewise
what
ho
i
not
going
back
till
i
jolly
well
got
to
caddie
my
driver
please
the
enchanted
castle
there
are
warm
days
in
london
when
even
a
fails
to
charm
and
one
longs
for
the
more
open
spaces
of
the
country
besides
one
wants
to
see
how
the
other
flowers
are
getting
on
it
is
on
these
days
that
we
travel
to
our
castle
of
stopes
as
the
crow
flies
fifteen
miles
away
indeed
that
is
the
way
we
get
to
it
for
it
is
a
castle
in
the
air
and
when
we
are
come
to
it
celia
is
always
in
a
pink
sunbonnet
gathering
roses
lovingly
and
i
not
very
far
off
am
speaking
strongly
to
somebody
or
other
about
something
i
want
done
i
shall
go
into
the
library
and
work
with
an
occasional
glance
through
the
open
window
at
celia
to
think
that
a
month
ago
we
were
quite
happy
with
a
few
pink
geraniums
sunday
a
month
ago
was
hot
let
take
train
somewhere
said
celia
and
have
lunch
under
a
hedge
i
know
a
lovely
place
for
hedges
i
said
i
know
a
lovely
tin
of
potted
grouse
said
celia
and
she
went
off
to
cut
some
sandwiches
by
twelve
we
were
getting
out
of
the
train
the
first
thing
we
came
to
was
a
golf
course
and
celia
had
to
drag
me
past
it
then
we
came
to
a
wood
and
i
had
to
drag
her
through
it
another
mile
along
a
lane
and
then
we
both
stopped
together
oh
we
said
it
was
a
cottage
the
cottage
of
a
dream
and
by
a
cottage
i
mean
not
four
plain
rooms
and
a
kitchen
but
one
surprising
room
opening
into
another
rooms
all
on
different
levels
and
of
different
shapes
with
delightful
places
to
bump
your
head
on
open
fireplaces
a
large
square
hall
where
your
guests
can
hang
about
after
breakfast
while
deciding
whether
to
play
golf
or
sit
in
the
garden
yet
all
so
cunningly
disposed
that
from
outside
it
looks
only
a
cottage
or
at
most
two
cottages
persuaded
into
one
and
of
course
we
only
saw
it
from
outside
the
little
drive
determined
to
get
there
as
soon
as
possible
pushed
its
way
straight
through
an
old
barn
and
arrived
at
the
door
simultaneously
with
the
flagged
lavender
walk
for
the
humble
who
came
on
foot
the
rhododendrons
were
ablaze
beneath
the
south
windows
a
little
orchard
was
running
wild
on
the
west
there
was
a
hint
at
the
back
of
a
lawn
also
you
remember
there
was
a
golf
course
less
than
two
miles
away
oh
said
celia
with
a
deep
sigh
but
we
must
live
here
an
irish
terrier
ran
out
to
inspect
us
i
bent
down
and
patted
it
with
a
dog
i
added
is
it
all
lovely
i
wonder
who
it
belongs
to
and
if
if
he
like
to
give
it
to
us
perhaps
he
would
if
he
saw
us
and
admired
us
very
much
said
celia
hopefully
i
do
think
barlow
is
that
sort
of
man
i
said
an
excellent
fellow
but
not
one
to
take
these
sudden
fancies
barlow
how
do
you
know
his
name
i
have
these
surprising
intuitions
i
said
modestly
the
way
the
chimneys
stand
up
i
know
cried
celia
the
dog
collar
right
watson
and
the
name
of
the
house
is
stopes
she
repeated
it
to
herself
with
a
frown
what
a
disappointing
name
she
said
just
stopes
stopes
i
said
stopes
stopes
if
you
keep
on
saying
it
a
certain
charm
seems
to
gather
round
it
stopes
stopes
said
celia
it
rather
jolly
we
said
it
ten
more
times
each
and
it
seemed
the
only
possible
name
for
it
stopes
of
course
well
i
asked
we
must
write
to
barlow
said
celia
decisively
barlow
er
dear
barlow
we
yes
it
will
be
rather
difficult
what
do
we
want
to
say
exactly
barlow
may
we
have
your
house
yes
smiled
celia
but
i
afraid
we
can
hardly
ask
for
it
but
we
might
rent
it
when
when
he
does
want
it
any
more
barlow
i
amended
you
any
idea
when
you
going
to
die
no
that
would
do
either
and
there
another
thing
we
know
his
initials
or
even
if
he
a
perhaps
he
a
knight
or
a
a
duke
think
how
offended
duke
barlow
would
be
if
we
put
barlow
esq
on
the
envelope
we
could
telegraph
after
you
with
stopes
perhaps
there
a
young
barlow
a
barlowette
or
two
with
expectations
it
may
have
been
in
the
family
for
years
then
we
oh
let
have
lunch
she
sat
down
and
began
to
undo
the
sandwiches
dear
o
stopes
she
said
with
her
mouth
full
we
lunched
outside
stopes
surely
if
earl
barlow
had
seen
us
he
would
have
asked
us
in
but
no
doubt
his
looked
the
other
way
towards
the
east
and
north
as
i
pointed
out
to
celia
thus
being
pleasantly
cool
at
ha
barlow
i
said
dramatically
a
time
will
come
when
shall
be
lunching
in
there
and
bah
and
i
tossed
a
sandwich
to
his
dog
however
that
did
get
us
any
nearer
will
you
said
celia
that
we
shall
have
lunch
in
there
one
day
i
promise
i
said
readily
that
gave
me
about
sixty
years
to
do
something
in
i
like
who
was
it
who
saw
something
of
another
man
and
would
be
happy
till
he
got
it
the
baby
in
the
soap
advertisement
no
no
some
king
in
history
i
believe
you
are
thinking
of
ahab
but
you
are
a
bit
like
him
really
besides
we
not
coveting
stopes
all
we
want
to
know
is
does
barlow
ever
let
it
in
the
summer
that
it
said
celia
eagerly
and
if
so
i
went
on
will
he
lend
us
the
money
to
pay
the
rent
with
er
yes
said
celia
that
it
so
for
a
month
we
have
lived
in
our
castle
of
stopes
i
see
celia
there
in
her
pink
gathering
the
flowers
lovingly
bringing
an
armful
of
them
into
the
hall
disturbing
me
sometimes
in
the
library
with
they
beauties
no
i
only
just
looked
in
good
luck
to
you
and
she
sees
me
ordering
a
man
about
importantly
or
waving
my
hand
to
her
as
i
ride
through
the
old
barn
on
my
road
to
the
golf
course
but
this
morning
she
had
an
idea
suppose
she
said
timidly
you
about
stopes
and
barlow
happened
to
see
it
and
knew
how
much
we
wanted
it
and
well
then
said
celia
firmly
if
he
were
a
gentleman
he
would
give
it
to
us
very
well
now
we
shall
see
if
barlow
is
a
gentleman
the
sands
of
pleasure
ladies
first
so
we
will
start
with
jenny
jenny
is
only
nine
but
she
has
been
to
the
seaside
before
and
knows
all
about
it
she
wears
the
fashionable
de
which
consists
of
a
white
linen
hat
a
jersey
and
an
overcrowded
pair
of
into
which
not
only
jenny
but
the
rest
of
her
wardrobe
has
had
to
fit
itself
two
slim
brown
legs
emerge
to
bear
the
burden
and
one
feels
that
if
she
fell
over
she
would
have
to
stay
there
until
somebody
picked
her
up
she
is
holding
richard
henry
by
the
hand
richard
henry
is
four
and
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
seen
the
sea
jenny
is
showing
it
to
him
privately
he
thinks
that
it
has
been
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
it
in
his
suburb
particularly
from
jenny
who
had
been
there
before
and
naturally
one
expected
something
rather
well
rather
more
like
what
they
had
been
saying
it
was
like
however
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
keep
in
with
jenny
and
not
to
let
her
see
that
he
is
disappointed
so
every
time
she
says
is
the
sea
lovely
he
echoes
lovely
and
now
and
then
he
adds
just
to
humour
her
is
the
sea
and
then
she
has
the
chance
to
say
again
yes
that
the
sea
darling
is
it
lovely
it
is
obvious
that
she
is
proud
of
it
apparently
she
put
it
there
anyway
it
seems
to
be
hers
now
jenny
has
brought
father
and
mother
as
well
as
richard
henry
there
they
are
over
there
when
she
came
before
she
had
to
leave
them
behind
much
to
their
disappointment
father
was
saying
form
fours
left
before
going
off
to
france
again
and
mother
was
buying
wool
to
make
him
some
more
socks
it
was
a
great
relief
to
them
to
know
that
they
were
being
taken
this
time
and
that
they
would
have
jenny
to
tell
them
all
about
it
father
is
lying
in
a
smoking
his
pipe
there
has
been
an
interesting
discussion
this
afternoon
as
to
whether
he
is
a
coward
or
not
father
thought
he
was
but
mother
was
quite
so
sure
jenny
said
that
of
course
he
could
really
be
because
the
king
gave
him
a
medal
for
not
being
one
but
mother
explained
that
it
was
only
a
medal
he
had
over
and
father
happened
to
be
passing
by
the
window
i
do
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
it
said
father
i
simply
prefer
bathing
in
the
morning
oo
you
said
this
morning
you
preferred
bathing
in
the
afternoon
says
jenny
like
a
flash
i
know
but
since
then
i
had
time
to
think
it
over
and
i
see
that
i
was
hasty
the
morning
is
the
best
time
i
afraid
he
a
coward
said
mother
sadly
wondering
why
she
had
married
him
the
whole
point
is
why
did
jenny
bring
me
here
to
enjoy
yourself
said
jenny
promptly
well
i
am
said
father
closing
his
eyes
but
we
do
not
feel
so
sure
that
mother
is
enjoying
herself
she
has
just
read
in
the
paper
about
a
mine
that
floated
ashore
and
exploded
nobody
was
near
at
the
time
but
supposing
one
of
the
children
had
been
playing
with
it
which
one
said
father
lazily
jenny
then
we
should
have
lost
jenny
this
being
so
jenny
promises
solemnly
not
to
play
with
any
mine
that
comes
ashore
nor
to
let
richard
henry
play
with
it
nor
to
allow
it
to
play
with
richard
henry
nor
i
suppose
i
may
just
point
it
out
to
him
and
say
that
a
mine
says
jenny
wistfully
if
she
ca
do
this
it
does
seem
to
be
much
use
coming
to
the
seaside
at
all
i
do
think
there
would
be
any
harm
in
that
says
father
but
engage
it
in
conversation
thank
you
very
much
says
jenny
and
she
and
richard
henry
go
off
together
mother
watches
them
anxiously
father
closes
his
eyes
now
says
jenny
eagerly
i
going
to
show
you
a
darling
little
crab
wo
that
be
lovely
richard
henry
having
been
deceived
as
he
feels
about
the
sea
is
not
too
hopeful
about
that
crab
however
he
asks
politely
what
a
crab
you
see
directly
darling
says
jenny
and
he
has
to
be
content
with
that
crab
he
murmurs
to
himself
suddenly
an
idea
occurs
to
him
he
lets
go
of
jenny
hand
and
trots
up
to
an
old
gentleman
with
white
whiskers
going
to
see
a
crab
he
announces
going
to
see
a
crab
are
you
my
little
man
says
the
old
gentleman
kindly
going
to
see
a
crab
says
richard
henry
determined
to
keep
up
his
end
of
the
conversation
well
i
never
so
you
going
to
see
a
crab
says
the
old
gentleman
doing
his
best
with
it
richard
henry
nods
two
or
three
times
going
to
see
a
crab
he
says
firmly
luckily
jenny
comes
up
and
rescues
him
otherwise
they
would
still
be
at
it
come
along
darling
and
see
the
crab
she
says
picking
up
his
hand
and
richard
henry
looks
triumphantly
at
the
old
gentleman
there
you
are
perhaps
he
will
believe
a
fellow
another
time
jenny
has
evidently
made
an
arrangement
with
a
particular
crab
for
this
afternoon
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
appointment
will
be
kept
for
she
has
hurried
richard
henry
past
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
which
he
wanted
to
stop
with
for
a
little
but
the
thought
of
this
lovely
crab
which
jenny
thinks
so
much
of
forbids
protest
quite
right
not
to
keep
it
waiting
what
will
it
be
like
will
it
be
bigger
than
the
sea
we
have
reached
the
rendezvous
we
see
now
that
we
need
not
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
there
says
jenny
excitedly
is
he
a
darling
little
crab
asleep
that
why
we
need
not
have
hurried
richard
henry
says
nothing
he
ca
think
of
the
words
for
what
he
is
feeling
what
he
wants
to
say
is
that
jenny
has
let
him
down
again
they
passed
a
lot
of
these
funny
little
things
on
their
way
here
but
jenny
would
stop
because
she
was
going
to
show
him
a
crab
a
great
big
enormous
darling
little
crab
which
might
have
been
anything
and
now
it
only
just
this
no
wonder
the
old
gentleman
did
believe
him
swindled
that
the
word
he
wants
however
he
ca
think
of
it
for
the
moment
so
he
tries
something
else
darling
little
crab
he
says
they
leave
the
dead
crab
there
and
hurry
back
what
shall
i
show
you
says
jenny
golden
memories
when
memory
with
its
scorn
of
ages
its
predilection
for
the
past
turns
back
about
a
billion
pages
and
lands
us
by
the
cam
at
last
is
it
the
thought
of
granta
once
our
daughter
the
freshers
match
the
second
in
our
mays
that
makes
our
mouth
our
very
soul
to
water
ah
no
ah
no
it
is
the
salmon
mayonnaise
the
work
we
did
was
rarely
reckoned
worthy
a
tutor
kindly
word
for
when
i
said
we
got
a
second
i
really
meant
we
got
a
third
the
games
we
played
were
often
tinged
with
bitter
amidst
the
damns
no
faintest
hint
of
praise
greeted
us
when
we
missed
the
authentic
sitter
but
thou
wert
always
kind
o
salmon
mayonnaise
even
our
nights
with
granta
even
the
style
that
week
by
blessed
week
mixed
calverley
and
stephen
with
much
that
was
i
hold
unique
even
our
parodies
of
the
rubáiyát
were
disappointing
yes
in
certain
ways
what
genius
loves
i
mean
the
people
shy
at
yet
no
one
ever
shied
at
salmon
mayonnaise
alas
no
restaurant
in
london
can
make
us
feel
that
thrill
again
though
what
they
do
or
what
leave
undone
i
often
ask
and
ask
in
vain
is
it
the
sauce
which
puts
the
brand
of
cam
on
each
maddening
dish
the
egg
the
yellow
glaze
the
cucumber
the
special
breed
of
salmon
i
only
know
we
loved
we
that
mayonnaise
did
beauty
some
may
ask
severely
visit
him
in
no
other
guise
it
can
not
be
that
salmon
merely
should
bring
the
mist
before
his
eyes
what
of
the
river
there
where
byron
pool
lay
the
warm
blue
morning
shimmering
in
the
haze
not
this
i
say
yet
something
else
ye
gods
to
think
of
that
salmon
mayonnaise
the
problem
of
life
the
noise
of
the
retreating
sea
came
pleasantly
to
us
from
a
distance
celia
was
lying
on
her
i
never
know
how
to
put
this
nicely
well
she
was
lying
face
downwards
on
a
rock
and
gazing
into
a
little
pool
which
the
tide
had
forgotten
about
and
left
behind
i
sat
beside
her
and
annoyed
a
limpet
three
minutes
ago
i
had
taken
it
suddenly
by
surprise
and
with
an
herculean
effort
moved
it
an
eighteenth
of
a
millimetre
westwards
my
silence
since
then
was
lulling
it
into
a
false
security
and
in
another
two
minutes
i
hoped
to
get
a
move
on
it
again
do
you
know
said
celia
with
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face
sometimes
i
think
i
quite
an
ordinary
person
after
all
you
are
a
little
bit
i
said
lazily
you
just
like
nobody
else
in
the
world
well
of
course
you
had
to
say
that
no
i
had
lots
of
husbands
would
merely
have
yawned
i
felt
one
coming
and
stopped
it
just
in
time
waiting
for
limpets
to
go
to
sleep
is
drowsy
work
but
why
are
you
so
morbid
about
yourself
suddenly
i
do
know
she
said
only
every
now
and
then
i
find
myself
thinking
the
most
thoughts
we
all
do
i
answered
as
i
stroked
my
limpet
gently
the
noise
of
our
conversation
had
roused
it
but
a
gentle
stroking
motion
i
am
told
by
those
to
whom
it
has
confided
will
frequently
cause
its
muscles
to
relax
the
great
thing
is
not
to
speak
them
still
you
better
tell
me
now
what
is
it
well
she
said
her
cheeks
perhaps
a
little
pinker
than
usual
i
was
just
thinking
that
life
was
very
wonderful
but
it
a
thing
to
say
it
holiday
time
i
reminded
her
the
need
for
sprinkling
our
remarks
with
thoughtful
words
like
and
is
over
for
a
bit
let
us
be
silly
i
scratched
in
the
rock
the
goal
to
which
i
was
urging
my
limpet
and
took
out
my
watch
three
i
shall
get
him
there
by
four
celia
was
gazing
at
two
baby
fishes
who
played
in
and
out
a
bunch
of
above
the
seaweed
an
anemone
sat
fatly
i
suppose
they
all
just
as
much
alive
as
we
are
she
said
thoughtfully
they
marry
i
looked
at
my
limpet
with
a
new
interest
and
bring
up
families
and
go
about
their
business
and
it
all
means
just
as
much
to
them
as
it
does
to
us
my
limpet
business
affairs
mean
nothing
to
me
i
said
firmly
i
am
only
wrapped
up
in
him
as
a
sprinter
are
you
going
to
try
to
move
him
again
he
not
quite
ready
yet
he
still
has
his
suspicions
celia
dropped
into
silence
her
next
question
showed
that
she
had
left
the
pool
for
a
moment
are
there
any
people
in
mars
she
asked
people
down
here
say
that
there
are
a
man
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
knew
this
for
a
fact
on
the
other
hand
people
in
mars
know
for
a
fact
that
there
is
anybody
on
the
earth
probably
they
are
both
wrong
i
should
like
to
know
a
lot
about
things
sighed
celia
do
you
know
anything
about
limpets
only
that
they
stick
like
i
suppose
more
about
them
known
than
that
i
suppose
so
by
people
who
have
made
a
specialty
of
them
for
one
who
has
preferred
to
amass
general
knowledge
rather
than
to
specialize
it
is
considered
enough
to
know
that
they
stick
like
you
have
specialized
in
anything
have
you
only
in
wives
celia
smiled
and
went
on
how
do
you
make
a
specialty
of
limpets
well
i
suppose
you
er
study
them
you
sit
down
and
and
watch
them
probably
after
dark
they
get
up
and
do
something
and
of
course
in
any
case
you
can
always
dissect
one
and
see
what
he
had
for
breakfast
one
way
and
another
you
get
to
know
things
about
them
they
must
have
a
lot
of
time
for
thinking
said
celia
regarding
my
limpet
with
her
head
on
one
side
tell
me
how
do
they
know
that
there
are
no
men
in
mars
i
sat
up
with
a
sigh
celia
you
do
dodge
about
so
i
have
barely
brought
together
and
classified
my
array
of
facts
about
things
in
this
world
when
dashed
up
to
another
one
what
is
the
connexion
between
mars
and
limpets
if
there
are
any
limpets
in
mars
they
are
freshwater
ones
in
the
canals
oh
i
just
wondered
she
said
i
mean
she
wrinkled
her
forehead
in
the
effort
to
find
words
for
her
thoughts
i
wondering
what
everything
means
and
why
we
all
here
and
what
limpets
are
for
and
supposing
there
are
people
in
mars
if
we
the
real
people
whom
the
world
was
made
for
or
if
are
she
stopped
and
added
one
evening
after
dinner
when
we
get
home
you
must
tell
me
all
about
celia
has
a
beautiful
idea
that
i
can
explain
everything
to
her
i
suppose
i
must
have
explained
a
stymie
or
a
very
cleverly
once
well
i
said
i
can
tell
you
what
limpets
are
for
now
they
like
sheep
and
cows
and
horses
and
pheasants
and
and
any
other
animal
they
just
for
at
least
so
the
wise
people
say
but
we
do
eat
limpets
no
but
they
can
amuse
us
this
one
and
with
a
sudden
leap
i
was
behind
him
as
he
dozed
and
i
had
dashed
him
forward
another
eighteenth
of
a
millimetre
this
one
has
amused
perhaps
said
celia
thoughtfully
and
i
do
think
it
was
quite
a
nice
thing
for
a
young
woman
to
say
perhaps
we
only
meant
to
amuse
the
people
in
mars
then
i
said
lazily
let
hope
that
they
amused
ten
days
later
the
great
war
began
celia
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
she
used
to
look
at
me
curiously
sometimes
and
i
fear
that
the
problem
of
life
left
her
more
puzzled
than
ever
at
the
risk
of
betraying
myself
to
her
as
quite
an
ordinary
person
after
all
i
confess
that
there
are
times
when
it
leaves
me
puzzled
too
iv
i
know
a
captain
of
industry
who
made
big
bombs
for
the
and
collared
a
lot
of
and
he
thank
god
has
the
i
know
a
lady
of
pedigree
who
asked
some
soldiers
out
to
tea
and
said
dear
me
and
yes
i
see
and
she
thank
god
has
the
i
know
a
fellow
of
who
got
a
job
with
a
fat
not
caring
much
for
the
infantry
and
he
thank
god
has
the
i
had
a
friend
a
friend
and
he
just
held
the
line
for
you
and
me
and
kept
the
germans
from
the
sea
and
died
without
the
thank
god
he
died
without
the
armageddon
the
conversation
had
turned
as
it
always
does
in
the
of
golf
clubs
to
the
state
of
poor
old
england
and
porkins
had
summed
the
matter
up
he
had
marched
round
in
that
morning
followed
by
a
small
child
with
an
umbrella
and
an
arsenal
of
weapons
and
he
felt
in
form
with
himself
what
england
wants
he
said
leaning
back
and
puffing
at
his
cigar
what
england
wants
is
a
war
another
whisky
and
soda
waiter
we
getting
flabby
all
this
pampering
of
the
poor
is
playing
the
very
deuce
with
the
country
a
bit
of
a
scrap
with
a
foreign
power
would
do
us
all
the
good
in
the
world
he
disposed
of
his
whisky
at
a
draught
we
flabby
he
repeated
the
lower
classes
seem
to
have
no
sense
of
discipline
nowadays
we
want
a
war
to
brace
us
up
it
is
well
understood
in
olympus
that
porkins
must
not
be
disappointed
what
will
happen
to
him
in
the
next
world
i
do
not
know
but
it
will
be
something
extremely
humorous
in
this
world
however
he
is
to
have
all
that
he
wants
accordingly
the
gods
got
to
work
in
the
little
village
of
ospovat
which
is
in
the
southeastern
corner
of
ruritania
there
lived
a
maiden
called
maria
strultz
who
was
engaged
to
marry
captain
tomsk
i
fancy
said
one
of
the
gods
that
it
might
be
rather
funny
if
maria
jilted
the
captain
i
have
an
idea
that
it
would
please
porkins
whatever
has
maria
began
a
very
young
god
but
he
was
immediately
suppressed
really
said
the
other
i
should
have
thought
it
was
sufficiently
obvious
you
know
what
these
mortals
are
he
looked
round
to
them
all
is
it
agreed
then
it
was
agreed
so
maria
strultz
jilted
the
captain
now
this
as
you
may
imagine
annoyed
captain
tomsk
he
commanded
a
frontier
fort
on
the
boundary
between
ruritania
and
essenland
and
his
chief
amusement
in
a
dull
life
was
to
play
cards
with
the
essenland
captain
who
commanded
the
fort
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
when
maria
letter
came
he
felt
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
drown
himself
on
second
thoughts
he
decided
to
drown
his
sorrows
first
he
did
this
so
successfully
that
at
the
end
of
the
evening
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
not
maria
who
had
jilted
him
but
the
essenland
captain
who
had
jilted
maria
whereupon
he
rowed
across
the
river
and
poured
his
revolver
into
the
essenland
flag
which
was
flying
over
the
fort
maria
thus
revenged
he
went
home
to
bed
and
woke
next
morning
with
a
bad
headache
we
off
said
the
gods
in
in
diedeldorf
the
capital
of
essenland
the
proceeded
to
remove
their
coats
the
blood
of
every
true
essenlander
said
the
of
the
diedeldorf
patriot
after
sending
out
for
another
pot
of
beer
will
boil
when
it
hears
of
this
fresh
insult
to
our
beloved
flag
an
insult
which
can
only
be
wiped
out
with
blood
then
seeing
that
he
had
two
bloods
in
one
sentence
he
crossed
the
second
one
out
substituted
the
sword
and
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
for
years
essenland
has
writhed
under
the
provocations
of
ruritania
but
has
preserved
a
dignified
silence
this
last
insult
is
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
stand
another
blood
had
got
in
but
it
was
a
new
sentence
and
he
thought
it
might
be
allowed
to
remain
we
shall
not
be
accused
of
exaggeration
if
we
say
that
essenland
would
lose
and
rightly
lose
her
prestige
in
the
eyes
of
europe
if
she
let
this
affront
pass
unnoticed
in
a
day
she
would
sink
from
a
to
a
power
but
he
did
say
how
the
chancellor
of
essenland
in
a
speech
gravely
applauded
by
both
sides
of
the
house
announced
the
steps
he
had
taken
an
ultimatum
had
been
sent
to
ruritania
demanding
an
apology
an
indemnity
of
a
hundred
thousand
marks
and
the
public
degradation
of
captain
tomsk
whose
epaulettes
were
to
be
torn
off
by
the
of
the
essenland
army
in
the
presence
of
a
full
corps
of
cinematograph
artists
failing
this
war
would
be
declared
ruritania
offered
the
apology
the
indemnity
and
the
public
degradation
of
captain
tomsk
but
urged
that
this
last
ceremony
would
be
better
performed
by
the
of
the
ruritanian
army
otherwise
ruritania
might
as
well
cease
to
be
a
sovereign
state
for
she
would
lose
her
prestige
in
the
eyes
of
europe
and
sink
to
the
level
of
a
power
there
was
only
one
possible
reply
to
this
and
essenland
made
it
she
invaded
ruritania
are
they
wonderful
said
the
gods
in
olympus
to
each
have
you
made
a
mistake
asked
the
very
young
god
porkins
lives
in
england
not
a
moment
said
the
others
in
the
capital
of
borovia
the
of
the
borovian
patriot
got
to
work
how
does
borovia
stand
he
asked
if
essenland
occupies
ruritania
can
any
thinking
man
in
borovia
feel
safe
with
the
enemy
at
his
gates
the
borovian
peasant
earning
five
marks
a
week
would
have
felt
no
less
safe
than
usual
but
then
he
could
hardly
be
described
as
a
thinking
man
it
is
vital
to
the
prestige
of
borovia
that
the
integrity
of
ruritania
should
be
preserved
otherwise
we
may
resign
ourselves
at
once
to
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
power
in
the
eyes
of
europe
and
in
a
speech
gravely
applauded
by
all
parties
the
borovian
chancellor
said
the
same
thing
so
the
imperial
army
was
mobilized
and
amidst
a
wonderful
display
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
by
those
who
were
remaining
behind
the
borovian
troops
marched
to
the
front
and
there
you
are
said
the
gods
in
olympus
but
even
now
began
the
very
young
god
doubtfully
silly
is
felicia
the
ally
of
essenland
is
marksland
the
ally
of
borovia
is
england
the
ally
of
the
ally
of
the
ally
of
the
country
which
holds
the
balance
of
power
between
marksland
and
felicia
but
if
any
of
them
thought
the
whole
thing
stupid
or
unjust
or
their
prestige
said
the
gods
gravely
trying
not
to
laugh
oh
i
see
said
the
very
young
god
and
when
a
year
later
the
english
mother
woke
up
to
read
that
her
boy
had
been
shot
i
am
afraid
she
shed
foolish
tears
and
thought
that
the
world
had
come
to
an
end
poor
creature
she
did
realize
that
porkins
who
had
marched
round
in
the
day
before
was
now
thoroughly
braced
up
what
babies
they
all
are
said
the
very
young

and
me
out
again
to
be
up
by
loos
i
got
me
first
i
just
dropped
gently
crawled
a
yard
and
rested
sickish
with
a
thirst
the
i
thought
and
smoking
then
someone
me
out
a
drink
what
poets
call
the
cooling
draft
and
seeing
i
done
a
think
i
thinks
and
laughed
i
not
a
soldier
nacheral
no
more
than
most
of
us
i
runs
a
business
with
a
pal
meaning
the
missis
fulham
way
greengrocery
the
cabbages
and
fruit
and
things
i
take
meself
and
she
has
dafts
and
crocuses
on
a
shelf
blighty
i
thinks
the
doctor
knows
talks
of
punctured
it
me
for
blighty
down
i
goes
i
ai
a
singer
but
i
sings
oh
goes
i
sort
of
oh
for
dear
old
england
shores
and
southampton
comes
blighty
i
says
and
roars
i
i
thort
i
done
my
bit
i
i
thort
the
war
would
stop
i
saw
meself
fit
with
missis
at
the
little
shop
the
same
like
as
it
used
to
be
the
same
old
markets
same
old
crowd
the
same
old
marrers
same
old
me
but
as
proud
as
proud
the
regiment
is
where
it
was
i
in
the
same
old
ninth
platoon
new
faces
most
and
keen
becos
they
thinks
the
thing
is
ending
soon
i
ai
complaining
mind
but
still
when
later
on
some
newish
bloke
stops
one
and
laughs
a
blighty
bill
i
wonder
where
the
joke
same
old
trenches
same
old
view
same
old
rats
as
blooming
tame
same
old
nothing
new
same
old
smell
the
very
same
same
old
bodies
out
in
front
same
old
from
till
same
old
scratching
same
old
same
old
bloody
war
lor
it
is
a
dream
it
just
as
it
used
to
be
every
bit
same
old
whistle
and
same
old
bang
and
me
to
stay
till
i
toby
it
will
save
trouble
if
i
say
at
once
that
i
know
nothing
about
horses
this
will
be
quite
apparent
to
you
of
course
before
i
have
finished
but
i
do
want
you
to
suppose
that
it
is
not
also
quite
apparent
to
me
i
have
no
illusions
on
the
subject
neither
i
imagine
has
toby
to
me
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
horse
chestnuts
roans
bay
rums
i
know
nothing
of
all
these
i
can
only
describe
a
horse
simply
as
a
nice
horse
or
a
nasty
horse
toby
is
a
nice
horse
toby
of
course
knows
much
more
about
men
than
i
do
about
horses
and
no
doubt
he
describes
me
professionally
to
his
colleagues
as
a
fellow
standing
about
eighteen
hoofs
but
when
he
is
not
being
technical
i
like
to
think
that
he
sums
me
up
to
himself
as
a
nice
man
at
any
rate
i
am
not
allowed
to
wear
spurs
and
that
must
weigh
with
a
horse
a
good
deal
i
have
no
real
right
to
toby
the
signalling
officer
official
mount
is
a
bicycle
but
a
bicycle
in
this
weather
and
there
toby
and
somebody
must
ride
him
and
as
i
point
out
to
the
other
subalterns
it
would
only
cause
jealousy
if
one
of
rode
him
and
why
would
it
create
more
jealousy
than
if
do
asked
one
of
them
well
i
said
you
the
officer
commanding
platoon
number
fifteen
fifteen
now
why
should
the
officer
commanding
the
fifteenth
platoon
ride
a
horse
when
the
officer
commanding
the
nineteenth
he
reminded
me
that
there
were
only
sixteen
platoons
in
a
battalion
such
a
long
time
since
i
had
anything
to
do
with
platoons
that
i
forget
all
right
we
say
the
sixteenth
why
should
have
a
horse
of
all
the
unjust
well
you
see
what
recriminations
it
would
lead
to
now
i
do
say
i
more
valuable
than
a
or
more
effective
on
a
horse
but
at
any
rate
there
are
sixteen
of
me
there
only
one
signalling
officer
and
if
there
a
spare
horse
over
what
about
the
bombing
officer
said
platoon
carelessly
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
bombing
officer
of
course
he
is
a
specialist
too
yes
quite
so
but
if
you
would
only
think
a
little
i
said
thinking
hard
all
the
time
you
would
well
put
it
this
way
the
range
of
a
mills
bomb
is
about
fifty
yards
the
range
of
a
field
telephone
is
several
miles
which
of
us
is
more
likely
to
require
a
horse
the
sniping
officer
he
went
on
dreamily
this
annoyed
me
you
do
shoot
snipe
from
horseback
i
said
sharply
you
mixing
up
shooting
and
hunting
my
lad
and
in
any
case
there
are
reasons
special
reasons
why
i
ride
toby
reasons
of
which
you
know
nothing
here
are
the
reasons
i
think
i
have
more
claim
to
a
horse
called
toby
than
has
a
contributor
to
our
feathered
friends
or
whatever
paper
the
sniping
officer
writes
for
when
i
joined
the
army
celia
was
inconsolable
i
begged
her
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
to
which
she
replied
that
she
could
do
it
better
if
i
promised
not
to
keep
a
bristly
one
i
pointed
out
that
the
country
wanted
bristles
and
though
between
ourselves
we
might
regard
it
as
a
promising
face
spoilt
for
a
tradition
still
discipline
was
discipline
and
so
the
bristles
came
and
remained
until
the
happy
day
when
the
war
office
at
the
risk
of
losing
the
war
made
them
optional
immediately
they
were
uprooted
now
the
colonel
has
only
one
fault
i
have
been
definitely
promised
my
second
star
in
so
he
wo
think
i
am
flattering
him
with
a
purpose
he
likes
moustaches
his
own
is
admirable
and
i
have
no
wish
for
him
to
remove
it
but
i
think
he
should
be
equally
about
mine
you
are
really
more
beautiful
without
it
he
said
a
moustache
suits
you
my
wife
does
think
so
i
said
firmly
i
had
the
war
office
on
my
side
so
i
could
afford
to
be
firm
the
colonel
looked
at
me
and
then
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
made
the
following
remarkable
statement
toby
he
said
gently
to
himself
does
like
officers
this
had
occurred
to
me
i
let
it
sink
in
of
course
i
said
at
last
one
must
consider
one
horse
i
quite
see
that
with
a
bicycle
he
said
it
different
and
so
there
you
have
the
second
reason
if
the
bombing
officer
rode
toby
i
should
shave
again
and
then
where
would
the
battalion
be
ruined
so
toby
and
i
go
off
together
up
till
now
he
has
been
good
to
me
he
has
bitten
one
company
commander
removed
another
and
led
the
colonel
a
chase
across
country
after
him
so
if
any
misunderstanding
occurs
between
us
there
will
be
good
precedent
for
it
so
far
my
only
real
trouble
has
been
once
when
billeting
billeting
is
delightful
fun
you
start
three
hours
in
advance
of
the
battalion
which
means
that
if
the
battalion
leaves
at
eight
in
the
morning
you
are
up
in
the
fresh
of
the
day
when
the
birds
are
singing
you
arrive
at
the
village
and
get
from
the
mayor
or
the
town
major
a
list
of
possible
hostesses
entering
the
first
house
labeled
officers
you
say
avez
un
lit
pour
un
officier
ici
pas
vive
la
she
answers
un
and
you
go
to
the
next
house
avez
place
pour
cent
hommes
oui
says
she
and
so
on
the
battalion
arrives
and
everybody
surrounds
you
where
are
men
going
where
is
billet
where
company
mess
have
you
found
anything
for
the
pioneers
and
so
one
knows
what
it
is
to
be
popular
well
the
other
day
the
major
thought
he
come
with
me
just
to
give
me
an
idea
how
it
ought
to
be
done
i
say
nothing
of
the
result
but
for
reasons
connected
with
toby
i
hope
he
wo
come
again
for
in
the
middle
of
a
narrow
street
crowded
with
lorries
he
jumped
off
his
horse
flung
i
think
that
the
expression
flung
me
the
reins
and
said
just
wait
here
while
i
see
the
mayor
a
moment
the
major
horse
i
can
describe
quite
shortly
a
nasty
big
black
horse
toby
i
have
already
described
as
a
nice
horse
but
he
had
been
in
mud
inspecting
huts
for
nearly
half
an
hour
and
was
sick
of
billeting
i
need
not
describe
to
you
and
so
seeing
that
you
know
the
constituents
i
must
let
you
imagine
how
they
all
mixed
this
is
a
beastly
war
but
it
has
its
times
and
when
our
own
particular
bit
of
the
battle
is
over
and
what
is
left
of
the
battalion
is
marching
back
to
rest
i
doubt
if
even
in
england
which
seems
very
far
off
you
will
find
two
people
more
contented
with
the
morning
than
toby
and
i
as
we
jog
along
together
common
seated
in
your
comfortable
club
my
very
dear
sir
or
in
your
delightful
madam
you
may
smile
pityingly
at
the
idea
of
a
mascot
saving
anybody
life
what
will
be
will
be
you
say
to
yourself
or
in
italian
to
your
friends
and
to
suppose
that
a
charm
round
the
neck
of
a
soldier
will
divert
a
german
shell
is
ridiculous
but
out
there
through
the
crumps
things
look
otherwise
common
had
sat
on
the
mantelpiece
at
home
an
ugly
little
ginger
dog
with
a
bit
of
red
tape
for
his
tongue
and
two
black
beads
for
his
eyes
he
viewed
his
limited
world
with
an
air
of
innocent
impertinence
very
attractive
to
visitors
common
he
looked
and
common
he
was
called
with
a
christian
name
of
howard
for
registration
for
six
months
he
sat
there
and
no
doubt
he
thought
that
he
had
seen
all
that
there
was
to
see
of
the
world
when
the
summons
came
which
was
to
give
him
so
different
an
outlook
on
life
for
that
summons
meant
the
breaking
up
of
his
home
master
was
going
wandering
from
trench
to
trench
mistress
from
one
person
house
to
another
person
house
she
no
doubt
would
take
common
with
her
or
perhaps
she
could
be
bothered
with
an
ugly
little
ginger
dog
and
he
would
be
stored
in
some
repository
boarded
out
in
some
olympic
kennel
or
do
you
think
master
might
he
looked
very
wistful
that
last
morning
so
wistful
that
mistress
could
bear
it
and
she
slipped
him
in
hastily
between
the
revolver
and
the
boracic
powder
just
to
look
after
you
she
said
so
common
came
with
me
to
france
his
first
view
of
the
country
was
at
rouen
when
he
sat
at
the
entrance
to
my
tent
and
hooshed
the
early
morning
flies
away
his
next
at
a
village
behind
the
lines
where
he
met
stout
fellows
of
d
company
and
took
the
centre
of
the
table
at
mess
in
the
apple
orchard
and
moreover
was
introduced
to
a
french
maiden
of
two
with
whom
at
the
instigation
of
the
seconds
in
the
business
her
mother
and
myself
a
prolonged
but
monotonous
conversation
in
the
french
tongue
ensued
common
under
suitable
pressure
barking
idiomatically
and
the
maiden
carefully
prompted
replying
with
the
native
for
a
pretty
greenwood
scene
beneath
the
and
in
any
decent
civilization
the
great
adventure
would
have
ended
there
but
common
knew
that
it
was
not
only
for
this
that
he
had
been
brought
out
and
that
there
was
more
arduous
work
to
come
once
more
he
retired
to
the
valise
for
we
were
making
now
for
a
vill
for
a
heap
of
bricks
near
the
river
you
may
guess
the
river
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
made
a
little
rhyme
for
him
there
was
a
young
puppy
called
howard
who
at
fighting
was
rather
a
coward
he
never
quite
ran
when
the
battle
began
but
he
started
at
once
to
hard
a
good
poet
is
supposed
to
be
superior
to
the
exigencies
of
rhyme
but
i
am
afraid
that
in
any
case
common
reputation
had
to
be
sacrificed
to
them
to
be
lyrical
over
anybody
called
howard
common
without
hinting
that
he
well
try
for
yourself
anyhow
it
was
a
lie
as
so
much
good
poetry
is
there
came
a
time
when
valises
were
left
behind
and
life
for
a
fortnight
had
to
be
sustained
on
a
pack
one
seems
to
want
very
many
things
but
there
was
no
hesitation
about
common
right
to
a
place
so
he
came
to
see
his
first
german
and
to
get
a
proper
understanding
of
this
dead
bleached
land
and
the
great
work
which
awaited
him
there
it
was
to
blow
away
shells
and
bullets
when
they
came
too
near
the
master
in
whose
pocket
he
sat
in
this
he
was
successful
but
i
think
that
the
feat
in
which
he
takes
most
pride
was
performed
one
very
early
summer
morning
a
telephone
line
had
to
be
laid
and
for
reasons
obvious
to
common
rather
rapidly
it
was
laid
safely
a
mere
nothing
to
him
by
this
time
but
when
it
was
joined
up
to
the
telephone
in
the
front
line
then
he
realized
that
he
was
called
upon
to
be
not
only
a
personal
mascot
but
a
mascot
to
the
battalion
and
he
sat
himself
upon
the
telephone
and
called
down
a
blessing
on
that
cable
so
that
it
remained
whole
for
two
days
and
a
night
when
by
all
the
rules
it
should
have
been
in
a
thousand
pieces
and
even
if
i
did
do
it
all
myself
he
said
anyhow
i
make
some
of
the
men
in
the
trench
smile
a
little
that
morning
and
there
was
so
much
smiling
going
on
just
then
you
know
after
that
morning
he
lived
in
my
pocket
sometimes
sniffing
at
an
empty
pipe
sometimes
trying
to
read
letters
from
mistress
which
joined
him
every
day
we
had
gone
north
to
a
more
gentlemanly
part
of
the
line
and
his
duties
took
but
little
of
his
time
so
that
anything
novel
like
a
pair
of
pliers
or
an
order
from
the
director
of
army
signals
was
always
welcome
to
begin
with
he
took
up
rather
more
than
his
fair
share
of
the
pocket
but
he
rapidly
thinned
down
alas
in
the
rigours
of
the
campaign
he
also
lost
his
voice
and
his
little
black
collar
his
only
kit
disappeared
then
just
when
we
seemed
settled
for
the
winter
we
were
ordered
south
again
common
knew
what
that
meant
a
busy
time
for
him
we
moved
down
slowly
and
he
sampled
billet
after
billet
but
we
arrived
at
last
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
day
and
then
he
began
to
get
nervous
always
he
was
present
when
the
operations
were
discussed
he
had
seen
all
the
maps
he
knew
exactly
what
was
expected
of
us
and
he
did
like
it
it
more
than
a
fellow
can
do
he
said
at
least
to
be
certain
of
i
can
blow
away
the
shells
in
front
and
the
shells
from
the
right
but
if
master
map
is
correct
we
going
to
get
enfiladed
from
the
left
as
well
and
one
ca
be
this
wants
thinking
about
so
he
dived
head
downwards
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
my
pocket
and
abandoned
himself
to
thought
a
little
later
he
came
up
with
a
smile
next
morning
i
stayed
in
bed
and
the
doctor
came
common
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
read
the
thermometer
a
hundred
and
four
said
common
golly
i
hope
i
have
it
he
came
with
me
to
the
clearing
station
i
only
just
blowed
a
germ
at
him
he
said
wistfully
one
i
found
in
his
pocket
i
only
just
blowed
it
at
him
we
went
down
to
the
base
hospital
together
we
went
back
to
england
and
in
the
hospital
in
england
common
suddenly
saw
his
mistress
again
i
brought
him
back
missis
he
said
here
he
is
have
i
done
well
he
sits
now
in
a
little
basket
lined
with
flannel
a
hero
returned
from
the
war
round
his
neck
he
wears
the
regimental
colours
and
on
his
chest
will
be
sewn
whatever
medal
is
given
to
those
who
have
served
faithfully
on
the
western
front
seated
in
your
comfortable
club
my
very
dear
sir
or
in
your
delightful
madam
you
smile
pityingly
or
perhaps
you
do
george
the
last
of
the
war
stories
i
the
colonel
of
the
nth
blankshires
was
seated
in
his
office
it
was
not
an
imposing
room
to
look
at
furnished
simply
but
tastefully
with
a
table
officers
for
use
of
one
and
a
chair
ditto
one
it
gave
little
evidence
of
the
distressing
scenes
which
had
been
enacted
in
it
and
still
less
evidence
of
the
terrible
scene
which
was
to
come
within
these
walls
the
colonel
was
accustomed
to
deal
out
stern
justice
to
offenders
and
many
a
hardened
criminal
had
been
carried
out
fainting
upon
hearing
the
terrible
verdict
one
day
but
the
colonel
was
not
holding
the
scales
of
justice
now
for
it
was
late
afternoon
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
anxiety
upon
his
face
he
read
and
the
document
which
he
held
in
his
hand
even
the
photograph
of
the
signed
yours
ever
henry
which
stood
upon
his
desk
brought
him
no
comfort
the
door
opened
and
major
murgatroyd
second
in
command
of
the
famous
blankshires
came
in
come
in
said
colonel
blowhard
the
major
saluted
impressively
and
the
colonel
rose
and
returned
his
salute
with
the
politeness
typical
of
the
british
army
you
wished
to
see
me
colonel
i
did
major
they
saluted
each
other
again
a
secret
document
of
enormous
importance
went
on
the
colonel
has
just
reached
me
from
the
war
office
it
concerns
the
regiment
the
dear
old
regiment
both
men
saluted
and
the
colonel
went
on
hoarsely
were
the
news
in
this
document
to
become
public
property
before
its
time
nothing
could
avert
the
defeat
of
england
in
the
present
cataclysm
is
it
as
important
as
that
colonel
said
the
major
even
more
hoarsely
if
anything
it
is
major
the
major
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
what
would
not
hindenburg
give
to
see
it
he
muttered
ay
said
the
colonel
i
say
that
to
myself
day
and
night
not
what
what
would
what
well
i
say
it
to
myself
day
and
night
for
this
reason
major
i
have
decided
to
entrust
the
news
to
no
one
but
yourself
our
officers
are
good
lads
and
a
credit
to
the
dear
old
regiment
they
saluted
as
before
but
in
a
matter
of
this
sort
one
can
not
be
too
discreet
you
are
right
colonel
the
colonel
looked
round
the
room
apprehensively
and
brought
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
the
major
the
secret
contained
in
this
document
are
we
alone
except
for
each
other
colonel
the
secret
went
on
the
colonel
is
this
that
on
and
after
the
of
the
month
men
in
category
are
to
be
included
in
category
my
god
gasped
the
major
if
hindenburg
knew
he
must
not
know
major
said
the
colonel
simply
i
can
trust
you
not
to
disclose
this
until
the
time
is
ripe
you
can
trust
me
colonel
they
grasped
hands
and
saluted
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
an
orderly
came
in
you
wanted
by
the
sir
he
told
the
colonel
ah
excuse
me
a
moment
said
the
latter
to
his
second
in
command
knowing
how
much
it
annoys
a
to
be
kept
waiting
he
saluted
and
hurried
out
just
a
moment
orderly
said
the
major
the
orderly
came
back
yes
sir
he
said
did
you
give
that
message
to
miss
blowhard
yes
sir
she
says
she
can
not
play
golf
with
you
because
she
is
playing
with
lord
smith
he
saluted
and
withdrew
left
alone
the
major
gave
vent
to
his
rage
lord
smith
he
stormed
curse
him
what
can
she
see
in
that
puppy
thrice
have
i
used
my
influence
to
send
him
away
on
a
musketry
course
and
thrice
has
he
returned
could
i
but
turn
him
out
of
the
regiment
for
good
i
might
win
the
love
of
the
fair
miss
blowhard
the
colonel
daughter
in
a
sudden
passion
he
picked
up
the
manual
of
military
law
and
flung
it
to
the
ground
all
at
once
an
idea
struck
him
and
a
crafty
look
came
into
his
eyes
by
jove
he
cried
the
secret
document
the
very
thing
to
put
the
document
into
an
envelope
was
the
work
of
a
moment
taking
up
a
pen
he
printed
on
the
outside
in
large
capitals
these
words
for
hindenburg
germany
with
a
diabolical
smile
he
sealed
the
envelope
up
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
lord
smith
to
be
brought
before
him
you
wanted
me
sir
said
lord
smith
on
his
arrival
of
all
the
distinguished
officers
in
the
nth
battalion
lord
smith
was
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
although
he
had
held
his
commission
for
three
years
he
had
only
been
arrested
twice
by
the
the
first
time
for
wearing
a
soft
cap
when
as
an
officer
and
gentleman
he
should
have
worn
a
hard
one
and
the
second
time
three
months
later
for
wearing
a
hard
cap
when
as
an
officer
and
gentleman
he
should
have
worn
a
soft
one
nobody
can
deny
that
these
were
serious
blots
on
his
career
but
it
was
felt
in
the
trenches
that
his
skill
with
the
rifle
partially
atoned
for
them
ah
smith
my
boy
said
the
major
genially
i
just
wanted
to
know
the
address
of
your
tailor
wonderfully
tunic
this
of
yours
he
went
over
to
him
and
under
pretence
of
examining
the
cut
of
his
tunic
dropped
the
envelope
cautiously
into
one
of
the
pockets
somewhat
surprised
at
the
compliment
paid
to
his
tailor
but
entirely
unsuspicious
lord
smith
gave
him
the
required
address
thanks
said
the
major
by
the
way
i
got
to
go
out
now
would
you
mind
waiting
here
till
the
colonel
comes
back
he
has
left
an
extremely
important
document
on
his
table
and
i
do
not
like
to
leave
the
room
unoccupied
certainly
sir
said
lord
smith
left
alone
our
hero
gave
himself
up
to
thought
for
some
reason
he
distrusted
the
major
he
felt
that
they
were
rivals
for
the
hand
of
rosamund
blowhard
on
ten
sundays
in
succession
he
had
been
forced
to
attend
church
parade
what
time
the
major
and
rosamund
were
disporting
themselves
on
the
golf
links
it
was
only
on
saturday
afternoons
that
he
had
a
chance
of
seeing
her
alone
and
yet
he
felt
somehow
that
she
loved
him
ah
smith
my
boy
said
the
colonel
as
he
bustled
in
always
glad
to
see
you
my
favourite
subaltern
he
went
on
with
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
the
best
officer
who
ever
formed
a
four
at
bridge
i
mean
who
ever
formed
fours
and
a
holder
of
no
fewer
than
three
musketry
certificates
lord
smith
smiled
modestly
there
i
must
get
on
with
my
work
went
on
the
colonel
sitting
down
at
his
table
and
turning
over
his
papers
you
find
me
very
you
find
me
you
find
good
heavens
what
is
it
sir
i
find
it
i
lost
it
the
secret
document
was
it
very
important
sir
important
cried
the
colonel
if
hindenburg
but
we
must
get
to
work
summon
the
guard
blow
the
send
for
the
orderly
sergeant
in
less
than
a
minute
the
room
was
full
of
armed
men
including
the
major
men
of
the
nth
blankshires
said
the
colonel
addressing
them
a
document
of
enormous
importance
has
been
stolen
from
this
room
unless
that
document
is
recovered
the
fair
name
of
the
regiment
will
be
irretrievably
tarnished
never
cried
a
corporal
of
the
signalling
section
and
there
was
a
deep
murmur
of
applause
may
i
suggest
sir
said
the
major
that
the
pockets
of
all
should
be
searched
i
myself
am
quite
ready
to
set
the
example
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
out
three
receipted
bills
and
a
price
list
of
tomatoes
and
placed
them
before
the
colonel
one
by
one
they
followed
his
example
suddenly
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
lord
smith
as
with
horror
and
amazement
upon
his
face
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
envelope
i
swear
i
never
put
it
there
sir
he
gasped
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
sir
said
the
major
that
i
asked
lord
smith
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
document
during
my
absence
no
doubt
he
placed
it
in
his
pocket
for
safety
several
men
applauded
this
suggestion
for
lord
smith
was
a
general
favourite
the
colonel
gave
one
glance
at
the
envelope
and
then
with
fire
flashing
from
his
eyes
held
it
up
for
all
to
see
how
do
you
account
for
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
with
a
gasp
of
horror
they
read
the
fatal
words
for
hindenburg
germany
the
colonel
and
the
other
officers
drew
their
swords
the
rank
and
file
fixed
bayonets
they
hacked
the
buttons
off
lord
smith
tunic
they
dug
the
stars
out
of
his
sleeves
they
tore
the
regimental
badge
from
his
cap
they
tore
his
collar
they
tore
his
tie
they
took
his
gold
and
still
he
stood
there
saying
proudly
i
am
innocent
go
said
the
colonel
pointing
with
his
sword
to
the
door
suddenly
there
was
a
commotion
outside
and
a
breathless
figure
pushed
its
way
into
the
room
father
cried
rosamund
blowhard
spare
him
he
is
innocent
rosamund
said
george
for
so
we
must
call
him
now
i
am
innocent
some
day
the
truth
will
be
known
then
he
took
a
tender
farewell
of
her
and
casting
a
glance
of
mingled
suspicion
and
hatred
at
the
major
he
strode
from
the
room
ii
the
patient
in
the
xth
bed
at
the
yth
base
hospital
stirred
restlessly
water
he
murmured
water
a
nurse
rose
and
poured
some
over
him
rosamund
he
breathed
and
with
a
smile
of
content
dropped
peacefully
asleep
again
who
was
he
this
mysterious
patient
in
number
x
bed
obviously
a
gentleman
from
the
colour
of
his
pyjamas
his
identity
disc
proclaimed
him
to
be
private
smithlord
of
the
qth
blankshires
there
was
something
strange
about
him
only
that
morning
he
had
received
the
from
sir
douglas
haig
the
from
general
pétain
the
order
of
the
golden
elephant
from
our
japanese
allies
the
order
of
the
split
haddock
from
the
president
of
nicaragua
and
the
order
of
the
neutral
nut
from
brazil
yet
he
cared
for
none
of
these
things
he
only
murmured
rosamund
who
was
private
smithlord
though
so
little
was
known
of
him
the
story
of
his
prowess
was
on
every
lip
an
officer
from
his
regiment
who
had
gone
out
alone
to
an
observation
post
had
been
surrounded
and
cut
off
by
the
enemy
threatened
on
all
sides
by
guns
and
bombs
of
every
calibre
he
had
prepared
to
sell
his
life
dearly
to
attempt
a
rescue
would
have
been
madness
even
the
most
reckless
town
major
would
have
blenched
at
the
idea
and
the
regiment
in
the
comparative
safety
of
their
trench
could
only
look
on
helplessly
all
but
private
smithlord
hastily
borrowing
the
colonel
horse
he
urged
the
gallant
animal
up
the
trench
and
away
over
the
top
and
then
began
a
race
such
as
had
never
been
seen
at
epsom
or
melton
mowbray
gad
said
a
sporting
subaltern
who
in
peace
days
had
frequently
entered
for
a
derby
sweepstake
at
the
national
liberal
club
the
beggar
can
ride
what
an
answering
cheer
rang
out
from
all
ranks
over
wire
entanglements
and
across
shell
holes
dashed
private
smithlord
firing
rapidly
with
his
revolver
all
the
while
nearer
to
the
officer
he
drew
and
then
suddenly
he
was
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
lashing
out
right
and
left
he
fought
his
way
to
the
man
he
had
come
to
rescue
pulled
him
up
behind
him
and
amidst
a
hurricane
of
bullets
charged
back
to
the
british
lines
nor
did
he
pause
till
he
arrived
at
the
colonel
i
have
brought
him
back
sir
he
said
and
fainted
when
he
awoke
it
was
to
find
himself
in
the
xth
bed
of
the
yth
base
hospital
and
who
is
it
in
the
next
bed
it
is
the
officer
whom
he
rescued
do
we
recognize
him
alas
no
although
unwounded
by
the
enemy
the
exposure
of
that
terrible
day
had
brought
on
a
severe
attack
of
mumps
we
can
not
recognize
him
but
the
nurse
assures
us
that
it
is
our
old
friend
major
murgatroyd
a
visitor
to
see
you
said
the
nurse
coming
in
and
waking
private
smithlord
up
ca
you
say
i
out
said
smithlord
expecting
it
was
another
foreign
decoration
and
wondering
what
language
he
would
have
to
speak
this
time
it
an
english
colonel
said
the
nurse
smithlord
saluted
and
begged
the
nurse
to
show
him
up
at
once
in
another
minute
colonel
blowhard
had
entered
i
want
to
thank
you
said
the
colonel
for
so
gallantly
rescuing
an
old
friend
of
mine
major
murgatroyd
belonging
to
the
nth
battalion
blankshires
but
now
attached
to
the
qth
smithlord
could
hardly
repress
a
start
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
not
recognized
the
features
of
the
man
he
had
saved
it
was
his
old
rival
it
is
curious
went
on
the
colonel
that
in
features
you
resemble
another
old
friend
of
mine
lord
smith
my
name
is
smithlord
sir
ah
any
relation
none
said
smithlord
crossing
his
thumbs
under
the
bedclothes
do
you
mind
ringing
the
bell
he
went
on
feeling
that
at
all
costs
he
must
turn
the
conversation
i
think
it
is
time
for
my
medicine
in
answer
to
the
colonel
ring
a
nurse
appeared
nurse
brown
has
just
gone
out
she
said
can
i
do
anything
for
you
good
heavens
rosamund
cried
the
colonel
yes
father
it
is
i
she
replied
simply
i
have
come
to
france
to
find
the
man
i
love
murgatroyd
said
the
colonel
but
this
gallant
fellow
was
the
man
who
by
the
way
let
me
introduce
you
private
smithlord
my
daughter
rosamund
the
two
looked
at
each
other
face
to
face
the
intuition
and
ready
wit
of
the
woman
pierced
the
disguise
which
had
baffled
the
soldier
father
she
cried
it
not
smithlord
it
lord
smith
george
rosamund
cried
george
we
can
not
keep
the
secret
any
longer
from
our
readers
it
lord
smith
tut
tut
sir
what
is
this
said
the
colonel
i
turned
you
out
of
the
regiment
three
weeks
ago
what
the
deuce
he
said
for
like
all
military
men
he
was
addicted
to
strong
language
what
the
deuce
does
this
mean
i
was
innocent
sir
father
he
was
innocent
he
was
innocent
said
a
hollow
voice
from
the
next
bed
in
amazement
they
all
looked
at
the
officer
lying
there
rosamund
he
cried
am
i
so
greatly
changed
the
colonel
handed
him
his
pocket
mirror
yes
sighed
the
major
i
understand
but
i
am
major
murgatroyd
major
murgatroyd
they
all
cried
this
gallant
fellow
here
whom
i
now
know
to
be
lord
smith
saved
my
life
i
can
not
let
him
suffer
any
longer
it
was
i
who
hid
the
secret
document
in
his
pocket
i
did
it
for
love
of
you
rosamund
he
held
out
his
hand
say
you
forgive
me
my
dear
lord
smith
lord
smith
shook
his
hand
warmly
but
little
more
remains
to
tell
a
month
later
our
hero
was
back
in
england
fortunately
the
quartermaster
had
kept
his
buttons
and
in
a
very
short
time
he
was
back
in
the
dear
old
uniform
and
the
wedding
of
lord
smith
to
rosamund
blowhard
was
one
of
the
events
of
the
season
and
what
of
major
murgatroyd
he
has
learnt
his
lesson
and
as
commandant
of
a
rest
camp
on
the
french
coast
he
is
the
soul
of
geniality
to
all
who
meet
him
the
ballad
of
private
chadd
i
sing
of
george
augustus
chadd
who
always
from
a
baby
had
a
deep
affection
for
his
dad
in
other
words
his
father
contrariwise
the
father
one
and
only
treasure
was
his
son
yes
even
when
he
gone
and
done
things
which
annoyed
him
rather
for
instance
if
at
christmas
say
or
on
his
parent
natal
day
the
thoughtless
lad
forgot
to
pay
the
customary
greeting
his
father
visage
only
took
that
dignified
reproachful
look
which
dying
beetles
give
the
cook
above
the
clouds
of
keating
as
years
went
on
such
looks
were
rare
the
younger
chadd
was
always
there
to
greet
his
father
and
to
share
his
father
birthday
party
the
pink
for
auld
acquaintance
sake
engraved
in
sugar
on
the
cake
was
his
the
speech
he
used
to
make
was
reverent
but
hearty
the
younger
chadd
was
twentyish
when
war
broke
out
but
did
not
wish
to
get
an
commish
or
be
a
sailor
just
private
chadd
he
was
and
went
to
join
his
dad
old
regiment
while
dad
the
dear
old
sent
for
red
tabs
from
the
tailor
to
those
inured
to
war
alarms
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
charms
of
raw
recruits
when
sloping
arms
nor
tell
why
chadd
was
hoping
that
if
his
increased
they
give
him
two
days
leave
at
least
to
join
his
father
birthday
feast
and
so
resumed
his
sloping
one
morning
on
the
training
ground
when
fixing
bayonets
he
found
the
fatal
day
already
round
and
even
as
he
fixed
he
decided
then
and
there
to
state
to
sergeant
brown
at
any
rate
his
longing
to
congratulate
his
sire
on
being
sixty
sergeant
he
said
we
on
the
eve
of
father
birthday
grant
me
leave
and
here
his
bosom
gave
a
heave
to
offer
him
my
blessing
and
if
a
private
tender
thanks
nay
do
not
blank
my
blanky
blanks
i
could
not
help
but
leave
the
ranks
birthdays
are
more
than
dressing
the
sergeant
was
a
kindly
soul
he
loved
his
men
upon
the
whole
he
also
had
a
father
pressed
on
him
fairly
lately
brave
chadd
he
said
thou
speakest
sooth
o
happy
day
o
pious
youth
great
he
extemporized
is
truth
and
it
shall
flourish
greatly
the
sergeant
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
captain
and
the
captain
tried
to
understand
and
more
or
less
succeeded
correct
me
if
you
do
agree
but
one
of
you
wants
said
he
and
george
augustus
chadd
said
me
meaning
of
course
that
did
the
captain
took
him
by
the
ear
and
gradually
brought
him
near
the
colonel
who
was
far
from
clear
but
heard
it
all
politely
and
asked
him
twice
you
want
a
the
captain
said
that
did
not
and
chadd
saluted
quite
a
lot
and
put
the
matter
rightly
the
colonel
took
him
by
the
hair
and
furtively
conveyed
him
where
the
general
inhaled
the
air
immaculately
booted
then
said
unless
i
greatly
err
this
private
wishes
to
prefer
a
small
petition
to
you
sir
and
so
again
saluted
the
general
inclined
his
head
towards
the
two
of
them
and
said
speak
slowly
please
or
shout
instead
i
hard
of
hearing
rather
so
chadd
that
promising
recruit
stood
to
attention
clicked
his
boot
and
bellowed
with
his
best
salute
happy
birthday
the
visitors
book
as
man
of
the
world
said
blake
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
of
five
foot
three
and
speaking
with
the
wisdom
of
nineteen
years
i
say
that
it
ca
be
done
in
any
other
company
certainly
at
headquarters
possibly
but
not
in
d
company
d
company
has
a
reputation
all
i
say
said
rogers
is
that
if
you
ca
run
any
mess
in
the
trenches
on
four
francs
a
day
you
a
rotten
mess
president
blake
turned
dramatically
to
his
company
commander
did
you
hear
that
billy
he
asked
yes
said
billy
i
was
just
going
to
say
it
myself
then
in
that
case
i
have
the
honour
to
resign
the
mess
presidency
nothing
doing
old
boy
you
detailed
you
ca
be
detailed
to
be
a
president
presidents
are
elected
by
popular
acclamation
they
resign
they
resign
to
avoid
being
shot
well
anyhow
they
resign
i
shall
send
my
resignation
in
to
the
army
council
it
will
appear
in
gazette
in
due
course
lieut
blake
resigns
his
mess
presidency
owing
to
the
enormous
price
of
sardines
per
thousand
and
the
amount
of
lime
juice
consumed
by
casual
visitors
i
tell
you
what
i
run
the
mess
on
four
francs
if
you
bar
guests
rot
it
nothing
to
do
with
guests
we
never
have
any
never
have
any
said
blake
indignantly
then
i
shall
keep
a
book
just
to
show
you
so
that
was
how
the
d
company
visitors
book
was
inaugurated
i
had
the
honour
of
opening
it
i
happened
to
be
mending
a
telephone
line
in
this
particular
trench
one
thirsty
day
and
there
was
the
and
well
there
was
i
dropped
in
hallo
said
blake
have
a
drink
i
had
a
lime
juice
then
i
had
another
and
then
very
reluctantly
i
got
up
to
go
army
form
book
was
handed
to
me
the
visitors
book
said
blake
you
can
just
write
your
name
in
it
or
you
can
be
funny
whichever
you
like
what
do
they
usually
do
i
asked
well
you
the
first
so
you
set
the
tone
for
god
sake
do
be
too
funny
it
was
an
alarming
responsibility
however
as
it
happened
i
had
something
which
i
wanted
to
say
thursday
i
wrote
pleasantly
entertained
as
usual
by
d
company
refused
a
pressing
invitation
to
stay
to
lunch
although
it
was
a
hot
day
and
i
had
a
long
walk
back
to
my
own
mess
i
handed
the
book
back
to
blake
he
read
it
and
with
one
foot
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
dugout
i
waited
anxiously
oh
i
say
do
stay
to
lunch
he
said
i
gave
a
start
of
surprise
oh
thanks
very
much
i
said
and
i
took
my
foot
off
the
step
it
would
be
rather
i
think
perhaps
well
thanks
very
much
once
begun
the
book
filled
up
rapidly
subalterns
from
other
companies
used
to
call
round
for
the
purpose
of
being
funny
i
suppose
that
unconsciously
i
had
been
too
humorous
anyway
the
tone
had
been
set
the
bombing
officer
i
remember
vowed
that
blake
hospitality
was
so
charming
that
he
would
bring
his
wife
and
family
next
time
a
gunner
officer
broke
into
verse
a
painful
business
one
way
and
another
it
was
not
long
before
the
last
page
was
reached
we
must
get
the
general
for
the
last
page
said
blake
do
be
an
ass
said
rogers
whatever
the
matter
do
you
think
he
do
it
you
would
have
the
cheek
to
ask
him
good
lord
you
do
stop
being
a
human
being
because
you
command
a
brigade
why
on
earth
should
i
ask
him
i
happened
to
turn
up
just
then
the
telephone
line
from
headquarters
to
d
company
always
seemed
to
want
attention
whatever
part
of
the
line
we
were
in
hallo
said
blake
have
a
drink
well
i
am
rather
thirsty
i
said
and
i
took
out
a
pencil
pass
the
visitors
book
and
let
get
it
over
no
you
do
said
blake
snatching
it
away
from
me
that
for
the
general
this
way
sir
said
a
voice
above
and
down
came
billy
followed
by
the
brigadier
we
jumped
up
you
have
a
drink
sir
said
billy
oh
thanks
very
much
what
will
you
have
sir
asked
blake
looking
round
wildly
lime
juice
or
or
lime
juice
i
have
lime
juice
thank
you
said
the
general
after
consideration
blake
produced
the
book
nervously
i
wonder
if
you
mind
he
began
the
general
looked
inquiring
and
started
feeling
for
his
glasses
he
was
just
feeling
in
his
fifth
pocket
when
billy
came
to
the
rescue
it
only
some
nonsense
of
blake
sir
he
said
he
keeps
a
book
ah
well
said
the
general
getting
up
another
day
perhaps
when
we
were
alone
again
blake
turned
on
billy
you
are
a
silly
ass
he
said
if
you
had
interfered
he
have
done
it
well
i
shall
fill
it
in
myself
now
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
monday
hospitably
received
by
company
and
much
enjoyed
the
mess
president
amusing
conversation
the
company
commander
and
a
subaltern
named
rogers
struck
me
as
rather
lacking
in
intelligence
blake
i
had
been
out
of
it
for
a
long
time
and
when
quite
accidentally
i
met
an
officer
of
the
battalion
in
london
i
was
nearly
a
year
behind
the
news
and
blake
i
said
after
he
told
me
some
of
it
that
nice
child
in
company
what
happened
to
him
did
you
hear
he
had
rather
a
funny
experience
he
went
into
that
last
show
as
senior
subaltern
of
billy
was
knocked
out
pretty
early
and
blake
took
on
after
that
we
had
a
lot
of
casualties
and
finally
we
were
cut
off
from
headquarters
altogether
and
had
to
carry
on
on
our
own
billy
was
the
senior
company
commander
and
took
charge
of
the
battalion
i
do
quite
know
how
it
happened
after
that
we
all
got
rather
mixed
up
i
suppose
anyway
at
one
time
blake
was
actually
commanding
the
brigade
he
was
splendid
simply
all
over
the
place
he
got
the
he
rather
bucked
with
himself
young
blake
as
a
brigadier
funny
it
not
so
very
i
said
from
a
full
heart
in
days
of
peace
my
rightly
regarded
me
as
more
like
a
bishop
than
a
and
nothing
since
has
made
me
warlike
but
when
this
struggle
ends
and
i
have
seen
the
allies
dish
up
the
goose
of
hindenburg
oh
friends
i
shall
the
mildest
bishop
the
war
is
over
and
the
kaiser
out
of
print
i
going
to
buy
some
tortoises
and
watch
the
beggars
sprint
when
the
war
is
over
and
the
sword
at
last
we
sheathe
i
going
to
keep
a
and
listen
to
it
i
never
really
longed
for
gore
and
any
taste
for
red
corpuscles
that
lingered
with
me
left
before
the
german
troops
had
entered
brussels
in
early
days
the
colonel
shun
froze
me
and
as
the
war
grew
older
the
noise
of
someone
else
gun
left
me
considerably
colder
the
war
is
over
and
the
battle
has
been
won
i
going
to
buy
a
barnacle
and
take
it
for
a
run
when
the
war
is
over
and
the
german
fleet
we
sink
i
going
to
keep
a
egg
and
listen
to
it
the
captains
and
the
kings
depart
it
may
be
so
but
not
lieutenants
dawn
after
weary
dawn
i
start
the
round
of
penance
one
rock
amid
the
welter
stands
on
which
my
gaze
is
fixed
intently
an
in
quiet
lands
lived
very
lazily
and
gently
the
war
is
over
and
we
done
the
belgians
proud
i
going
to
keep
a
chrysalis
and
read
to
it
aloud
when
the
war
is
over
and
we
finished
up
the
show
i
going
to
plant
a
and
listen
to
it
oh
i
tired
of
the
noise
and
the
turmoil
of
battle
and
i
even
upset
by
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
the
clang
of
the
bluebells
is
death
to
my
liver
and
the
roar
of
the
dandelion
gives
me
a
shiver
and
a
glacier
in
movement
is
much
too
exciting
and
i
nervous
when
standing
on
one
of
alighting
give
me
peace
that
is
all
that
is
all
that
i
seek
say
starting
on
saturday
week
one
star
occasionally
i
receive
letters
from
friends
whom
i
have
not
seen
lately
addressed
to
lieutenant
m
and
apologizing
prettily
inside
in
case
i
am
by
now
a
colonel
in
i
am
sometimes
called
and
up
at
the
fort
the
other
day
a
sentry
of
the
royal
defence
corps
wearing
the
créçy
medal
mistook
me
for
a
major
and
presented
crossbows
to
me
this
is
all
wrong
as
garvin
well
points
out
it
is
important
that
we
should
not
have
a
false
perspective
of
the
war
let
me
then
make
it
perfectly
plain
i
am
a
second
lieutenant
when
i
first
became
a
second
lieutenant
i
was
rather
proud
i
was
a
second
lieutenant
on
probation
on
my
right
sleeve
i
wore
a
single
star
so
on
probation
of
course
on
my
left
sleeve
i
wore
another
star
so
also
on
probation
they
were
good
stars
none
better
in
the
service
and
as
we
did
like
the
sound
of
on
probation
celia
put
a
few
stitches
in
them
to
make
them
more
permanent
this
proved
effective
six
months
later
i
had
a
very
pleasant
note
from
the
king
telling
me
that
the
days
of
probation
were
now
over
and
making
it
clear
that
he
and
i
were
friends
i
was
now
a
real
second
lieutenant
on
my
right
sleeve
i
had
a
single
star
thus
not
on
probation
on
my
left
sleeve
i
also
had
a
single
star
in
this
manner
this
star
also
was
now
a
fixed
one
from
that
time
forward
my
thoughts
dwelt
naturally
on
promotion
there
were
exalted
persons
in
the
regiment
called
lieutenants
they
had
two
stars
on
each
sleeve
so
i
decided
to
become
a
lieutenant
promotion
in
our
regiment
was
difficult
after
giving
the
matter
every
consideration
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
to
win
my
second
star
was
to
save
the
colonel
life
i
used
to
follow
him
about
affectionately
in
the
hope
that
he
would
fall
into
the
sea
he
was
a
big
strong
man
and
a
powerful
swimmer
but
once
in
the
water
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
cling
round
his
neck
and
give
an
impression
that
i
was
rescuing
him
however
he
refused
to
fall
in
i
fancy
that
he
wore
somebody
military
soles
which
prevent
slipping
years
rolled
on
i
used
to
look
at
my
stars
sometimes
one
on
each
sleeve
they
seemed
very
lonely
at
times
they
came
close
together
but
at
other
times
as
for
instance
when
i
was
semaphoring
they
were
very
far
apart
to
prevent
these
occasional
separations
celia
took
them
off
my
sleeves
and
put
them
on
my
shoulders
one
on
each
shoulder
so
and
so
there
they
stayed
and
more
years
rolled
on
one
day
celia
came
to
me
in
great
excitement
have
you
seen
this
in
the
paper
about
promotion
she
said
eagerly
no
what
is
it
i
asked
are
they
making
more
generals
i
do
know
about
generals
it
second
lieutenants
being
lieutenants
you
joking
on
a
very
grave
subject
i
said
seriously
you
expect
to
win
the
war
if
you
go
on
like
that
well
you
read
it
she
said
handing
me
the
paper
i
took
the
paper
with
a
trembling
hand
and
read
she
was
right
if
the
paper
was
to
be
believed
all
second
lieutenants
were
to
become
lieutenants
after
eighteen
years
service
at
last
my
chance
had
come
my
dear
this
is
wonderful
i
said
in
another
fifteen
years
we
shall
be
there
you
might
buy
two
more
stars
this
afternoon
and
practise
sewing
them
on
in
order
to
be
ready
you
must
be
taken
by
surprise
when
the
actual
moment
comes
but
you
a
lieutenant
she
said
if
that
true
it
says
that
eighteen
months
i
snatched
up
the
paper
again
good
heavens
it
was
eighteen
not
years
then
i
a
lieutenant
i
said
we
had
a
bottle
of
champagne
for
dinner
that
night
and
celia
got
the
paper
and
read
it
aloud
to
my
tunic
and
just
for
practice
she
took
the
two
stars
off
my
other
tunic
and
sewed
them
on
this
one
thus
and
we
had
a
very
happy
evening
i
suppose
it
will
be
a
few
days
before
it
officially
announced
i
said
bother
i
suppose
it
will
said
celia
and
very
reluctantly
she
took
one
star
off
each
shoulder
leaving
the
matter
so
and
the
years
rolled
on
and
i
am
still
a
second
lieutenant
i
do
not
complain
indeed
i
am
even
rather
proud
of
it
if
i
am
not
gaining
on
my
original
one
star
at
least
i
am
keeping
pace
with
it
i
might
so
easily
have
been
a
corporal
by
now
but
i
should
like
to
have
seen
a
little
more
notice
taken
of
me
in
the
gazette
i
scan
it
every
day
hoping
for
some
such
announcement
as
this
lieutenant
remain
a
second
or
this
lieutenant
be
seconded
and
to
retain
his
present
rank
of
second
or
even
this
lieutenant
the
rank
of
acting
second
lieutenant
on
ceasing
to
command
a
battalion
and
reverts
to
the
rank
of
second
failing
this
i
have
thought
sometimes
of
making
an
announcement
in
the
personal
column
of
the
times
second
lieutenant
m
regrets
that
his
duties
as
a
second
lieutenant
prevent
him
from
replying
personally
to
the
many
kind
inquiries
he
has
received
and
begs
to
take
this
opportunity
of
announcing
that
he
still
retains
a
star
on
each
shoulder
both
doing
well
but
perhaps
that
is
unnecessary
now
i
think
that
by
this
time
i
have
made
it
clear
just
how
many
stars
i
possess
one
on
the
right
shoulder
so
and
one
on
the
left
shoulder
so
that
is
all
the
joke
a
tragedy
chapter
i
the
joke
was
born
one
october
day
in
the
trench
called
mechanics
not
so
far
from
loos
we
had
just
come
back
into
the
line
after
six
days
in
reserve
and
the
afternoon
being
quiet
i
was
writing
my
daily
letter
to
celia
i
was
telling
her
about
our
cat
imported
into
our
in
the
hope
that
it
would
keep
the
rats
down
when
suddenly
the
joke
came
i
was
so
surprised
by
it
that
i
added
in
brackets
this
is
quite
my
own
only
just
thought
of
it
later
on
the
came
and
the
joke
started
on
its
way
to
england
chapter
ii
chapter
ii
finds
me
some
months
later
at
home
again
do
you
remember
that
joke
about
the
rats
in
one
of
your
letters
said
celia
one
evening
yes
you
never
told
me
if
you
liked
it
i
simply
loved
it
you
are
going
to
waste
it
are
you
if
you
simply
loved
it
it
was
wasted
but
i
want
everybody
else
could
you
use
it
in
the
revue
i
was
supposed
to
be
writing
a
revue
at
this
time
for
a
certain
impresario
i
was
getting
on
very
fast
because
whenever
i
suggested
a
scene
to
him
he
either
said
oh
that
been
done
which
killed
it
or
else
he
said
oh
but
that
never
been
done
which
killed
it
even
more
completely
good
idea
i
said
to
celia
we
have
a
trench
scene
i
suggested
it
to
the
impresario
when
next
i
saw
him
oh
that
been
done
he
said
mine
will
be
quite
different
from
anybody
else
i
said
firmly
he
brightened
up
a
little
all
right
try
it
he
said
i
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
secret
of
successful
the
trench
scene
was
written
it
was
written
round
the
joke
whose
bright
beams
like
a
perfect
jewel
in
a
perfect
setting
however
i
said
all
that
to
celia
at
the
time
she
was
just
going
to
have
said
it
herself
she
told
me
so
far
so
good
but
a
month
later
the
revue
collapsed
the
impresario
and
i
agreed
upon
many
things
as
for
instance
that
the
war
would
be
a
long
one
and
that
hindenburg
was
no
fool
but
there
were
two
points
upon
which
we
could
never
quite
agree
what
was
funny
and
which
of
us
was
writing
the
revue
so
with
mutual
expressions
of
goodwill
and
hopes
that
one
day
we
might
write
a
tragedy
together
we
parted
that
ended
the
revue
it
ended
the
trench
scene
and
for
the
moment
it
ended
the
joke
chapter
iii
chapter
iii
finds
the
war
over
and
celia
still
at
it
you
have
got
that
joke
in
yet
she
had
just
read
an
article
of
mine
called
autumn
in
a
country
vicarage
it
would
go
in
there
very
well
i
said
it
would
go
in
anywhere
where
there
were
rats
there
might
easily
be
rats
in
a
vicarage
not
in
this
one
you
talk
about
as
a
church
mouse
i
am
an
artist
i
said
thumping
my
heart
and
forehead
and
other
seats
of
the
emotions
i
do
happen
to
rats
there
and
if
i
do
see
them
i
ca
write
about
them
anyhow
they
would
be
secular
rats
like
the
ones
i
made
my
joke
about
i
do
mind
whether
the
rats
are
secular
or
circular
said
celia
but
do
get
them
in
soon
well
i
tried
i
really
did
try
but
for
months
i
could
get
those
rats
in
it
was
a
near
thing
sometimes
and
i
would
think
that
i
had
them
but
at
the
last
moment
they
would
whisk
off
and
back
into
their
holes
again
i
even
wrote
an
article
about
cooking
in
the
great
war
feeling
that
that
would
surely
tempt
them
but
they
were
not
to
be
drawn
chapter
iv
but
at
last
the
perfect
opportunity
came
i
received
a
letter
from
a
botanical
paper
asking
for
an
article
on
the
flora
of
trench
life
horray
said
celia
there
you
are
i
sat
down
and
wrote
the
article
working
up
gradually
to
the
subject
of
rats
and
even
more
gradually
intertwining
it
so
to
speak
with
the
subject
of
cats
i
brought
off
in
one
perfect
climax
the
great
joke
lovely
said
celia
excitedly
there
is
one
small
point
which
has
occurred
to
me
rats
are
not
i
just
remembered
oh
does
it
matter
for
a
botanical
paper
yes
and
then
celia
had
a
brilliant
inspiration
send
it
to
another
paper
she
said
i
did
two
days
later
it
appeared
considering
that
i
had
had
a
proof
it
came
out
extraordinarily
well
there
was
only
one
misprint
it
was
at
the
critical
word
of
the
joke
chapter
v
that
torn
it
i
said
to
celia
i
suppose
it
has
she
said
sadly
the
world
will
never
hear
the
joke
now
it
had
it
wrong
but
still
it
had
it
and
i
ca
repeat
it
celia
began
to
smile
it
sickening
she
said
but
it
really
rather
funny
you
know
and
then
she
had
another
brilliant
inspiration
in
fact
you
might
write
an
article
about
it
and
as
you
see
i
have
epilogue
having
read
thus
far
celia
says
but
you
still
have
got
the
joke
in
oh
well
here
goes
from
we
came
back
to
the
line
to
find
that
the
cat
had
kittened
however
as
all
the
rats
seem
to
have
rottened
we
are
much
as
we
were
rottened
was
misprinted
rattened
which
seems
to
me
to
spoil
the
joke
yet
i
must
confess
that
there
are
times
now
when
i
feel
that
perhaps
after
all
i
may
have
overrated
it
but
it
was
a
pleasant
joke
in
its
day
the
last
pot
let
others
hymn
the
weariness
and
pain
or
if
they
will
the
glory
and
the
glamour
of
holding
fast
from
flanders
to
lorraine
the
thin
brown
line
at
which
the
germans
hammer
my
muse
a
more
domesticated
maid
aspires
to
sing
a
song
of
marmalade
o
marmalade
i
do
not
mean
the
sort
sweet
for
babes
and
maidens
fitter
but
that
wherein
the
golden
fishes
sport
on
oranges
seas
with
just
a
dash
of
bitter
not
falsely
coy
but
eager
to
parade
their
southern
birth
in
short
o
marmalade
much
have
i
sacrificed
my
happy
home
my
faith
in
experts
figures
half
my
money
the
fortnight
that
i
meant
to
spend
in
rome
my
weekly
effort
to
be
fairly
funny
but
these
are
trifles
light
as
air
when
weighed
against
this
other
breakfast
marmalade
fair
was
the
porridge
in
the
days
of
peace
and
still
more
fair
the
cream
and
sugar
taken
plump
were
the
twin
poached
eggs
yet
not
obese
upon
their
thrones
of
toast
and
crisp
the
bacon
i
face
their
loss
undaunted
unafraid
if
only
i
may
keep
my
marmalade
an
evening
press
without
callisthenes
a
tables
staff
an
immobile
spaghetti
a
shaw
with
whom
the
common
man
agrees
a
zambra
searching
vainly
for
negretti
when
spades
are
trumps
a
hand
without
a
spade
so
is
my
breakfast
lacking
marmalade
o
northcliffe
lord
o
keiller
o
dundee
o
crosse
and
blackwell
limited
o
seville
o
orange
groves
along
the
middle
sea
o
jaffa
for
example
o
the
devil
let
beef
and
butter
rolls
and
rabbits
fade
but
give
me
back
my
love
my
marmalade
the
story
that
went
west
why
do
you
write
a
war
story
said
celia
one
autumn
day
when
that
sort
of
story
was
popular
because
everybody
else
does
i
said
i
forget
how
many
bayonets
we
have
on
the
western
front
but
there
must
be
at
least
twice
as
many
it
need
be
about
the
western
front
unfortunately
that
the
only
front
i
know
anything
about
i
thought
writers
used
their
imagination
sometimes
said
celia
to
anybody
who
might
happen
to
be
listening
oh
well
if
you
put
it
like
that
i
said
i
suppose
i
must
so
i
settled
down
to
a
story
about
the
salonica
front
the
scene
of
my
story
was
laid
in
an
old
clay
hut
amid
the
wattles
what
are
wattles
asked
celia
when
i
told
her
the
good
news
local
colour
i
explained
they
grow
in
bulgaria
are
you
sure
i
sure
that
these
ones
did
i
do
know
about
any
others
of
course
more
local
colour
was
wanted
than
a
mere
wattle
or
two
it
was
necessary
therefore
for
my
bulgarians
always
to
go
about
in
celia
thought
that
these
were
a
kind
of
native
trouser
laced
at
the
knee
she
may
be
right
my
own
impression
is
that
they
are
a
species
of
platoon
anyhow
the
bulgars
always
went
about
in
them
there
was
a
fierce
fight
which
raged
round
the
old
clay
hut
in
the
wattles
the
greeks
shouted
greek
tuptô
tuptomai
the
serbs
for
reasons
into
which
i
need
not
enter
were
inarticulate
with
rage
with
the
french
and
british
i
had
of
course
no
difficulty
and
the
bulgars
fortunately
were
content
with
hoarse
guttural
noises
it
was
a
fierce
fight
while
it
lasted
and
i
was
sorry
when
it
was
over
because
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
feel
at
home
with
my
story
i
need
not
say
that
many
a
bulgar
had
licked
the
wattles
before
i
had
finished
unfortunately
something
else
happened
before
i
had
finished
what
do
you
think
cried
celia
bursting
into
my
room
one
evening
just
when
i
was
wondering
whether
my
readers
would
expect
to
know
more
of
the
heroine
native
costume
than
that
it
was
simple
yet
becoming
wait
a
moment
i
said
it
too
good
to
wait
said
celia
excitedly
bulgaria
has
surrendered
celia
may
be
a
good
patriot
but
she
lacks
the
artistic
temperament
oh
has
she
i
said
bitterly
then
she
jolly
well
spoilt
my
story
the
one
about
the
wattles
yes
said
celia
frivolously
well
i
was
going
to
waste
my
wattles
with
great
presence
of
mind
i
decided
to
transfer
my
story
to
the
palestine
front
under
a
hard
blue
sky
of
intense
brilliance
the
old
clay
hut
stood
among
the
wattles
a
ran
by
the
side
of
it
not
a
small
turkish
dog
as
celia
thought
but
well
everybody
knows
what
a
is
the
battle
went
on
much
as
before
except
that
the
turks
were
naturally
more
outspoken
than
the
bulgars
calling
freely
upon
allah
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
and
reconciling
themselves
to
the
end
of
it
with
kismet
i
also
turned
some
of
the
horses
into
camels
and
for
the
sake
of
the
indian
troops
several
pairs
of
puttees
into
it
was
a
good
story
while
it
lasted
however
nobody
seems
to
care
about
art
nowadays
what
do
you
think
cried
celia
bursting
into
my
room
i
held
up
a
delaying
hand
i
had
suddenly
thought
of
the
word
adobe
my
story
seemed
to
need
it
somewhere
if
possible
among
the
wattles
but
listen
she
read
out
the
headline
surrenders
at
discretion
discretion
i
said
indignantly
i
have
never
heard
of
anything
so
tactless
and
it
is
as
though
i
could
even
move
on
to
mesopotamia
could
there
be
a
little
local
rising
in
persia
suggested
celia
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
it
i
said
thoughtfully
you
ca
do
much
with
just
wattles
and
a
little
sherbet
i
mean
you
ca
expect
the
public
to
be
interested
in
persia
at
such
a
moment
as
this
no
we
shall
have
to
step
westward
we
must
see
what
we
can
do
with
the
italian
front
but
i
had
very
little
hope
a
curious
foreboding
of
evil
came
over
me
as
i
placed
those
wattles
tenderly
along
the
west
bank
of
the
piave
the
old
clay
hut
still
stood
proudly
amid
them
the
bersaglieri
advanced
impetuously
with
cries
of
no
that
wrong
with
cries
of
well
anyhow
they
advanced
they
advanced
and
as
i
shut
my
eyes
i
seemed
to
see
no
not
that
old
clay
hut
amid
the
wattles
nor
yet
the
adobe
edifice
on
the
heights
of
asiago
but
celia
coming
into
the
library
with
another
paper
announcing
that
yet
another
country
was
deaf
to
the
call
of
art
if
anybody
wants
a
really
good
story
about
the
peninsular
war
and
will
drop
me
a
line
i
shall
be
glad
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
him
the
scene
is
laid
in
the
neighbourhood
of
badajoz
and
the
chief
interest
centres
round
an
old
yes
you
have
guessed
it
an
old
clay
hut
in
the
wattles
the
two
visits
areas
crystal
it
was
i
think
in
that
luck
or
providence
or
fate
assumed
the
more
material
state
of
aunt
or
alice
and
took
the
weather
being
fine
and
bill
the
eldest
only
nine
three
of
us
by
the
brighton
line
to
see
the
crystal
palace
observe
us
then
an
eager
four
advancing
on
the
western
door
or
possibly
the
northern
or
well
anyhow
advancing
aunt
alice
bending
from
the
hips
and
bill
in
little
runs
and
trips
and
john
with
frequent
hops
and
skips
while
i
was
fairly
dancing
aunt
alice
pays
the
turnstile
clicks
and
with
the
happy
crowds
we
mix
to
gaze
upon
well
i
was
six
say
getting
on
for
seven
and
looking
back
on
it
the
memories
have
passed
away
i
find
that
i
can
only
say
roughly
to
gaze
on
heaven
heaven
it
was
which
came
to
pass
within
those
magic
walls
of
glass
though
william
like
a
silly
ass
had
lost
my
bag
of
the
wonders
of
that
the
all
the
things
i
ca
recall
and
dominating
over
all
the
statues
more
than
adam
and
niobe
were
there
disraeli
much
the
worse
for
wear
samson
before
he
cut
his
hair
lord
byron
and
apollo
a
female
group
surrounded
by
a
camel
though
i
do
know
why
and
all
of
them
were
ten
feet
high
and
all
i
think
were
hollow
these
gods
looked
down
on
us
and
smiled
to
see
how
utterly
a
child
by
simple
things
may
be
beguiled
to
happiness
and
laughter
it
warmed
their
kindly
hearts
to
see
the
joy
of
bill
and
john
and
me
from
ten
to
lunch
from
lunch
to
tea
from
tea
to
six
or
after
that
evening
when
the
day
was
dead
they
tucked
a
babe
of
six
in
bed
arranged
the
pillows
for
his
head
and
saw
the
lights
were
shaded
too
sleepy
for
the
kiss
his
only
conscious
thought
was
this
no
man
shall
ever
taste
the
bliss
that
i
this
blessed
day
did
when
one
is
six
one
can
not
tell
and
john
who
at
the
palace
fell
a
victim
to
the
blondin
belle
is
wedded
to
another
and
i
my
intimates
allow
have
lost
the
taste
for
now
and
baldness
decorates
the
brow
of
bill
our
elder
brother
well
more
than
thirty
years
have
passed
but
all
the
same
on
thursday
last
my
heart
was
beating
just
as
fast
within
that
hall
of
wonder
my
bliss
was
every
bit
as
great
as
what
it
was
in
impossible
to
look
sedate
or
keep
my
feelings
under
the
gods
of
old
still
gazed
upon
the
scene
where
thirty
years
agone
the
lines
of
bill
and
me
and
john
were
cast
in
pleasant
places
and
friends
i
murmured
what
the
odds
if
you
are
rather
battered
gods
this
is
no
time
for
ichabods
and
er
ah
no
i
did
not
mourn
the
fell
work
upon
those
poor
old
dears
nor
pitt
nor
venus
drew
my
tears
and
set
me
slowly
sobbing
i
hailed
them
with
a
happy
laugh
and
slapped
old
samson
on
the
calf
and
asked
a
member
of
the
staff
for
officers
demobbing
that
evening
being
then
dispersed
i
swore
as
i
had
sworn
it
first
when
three
of
us
went
on
the
burst
with
aunt
or
alice
although
one
finds
as
man
or
boy
a
thousand
pleasures
to
enjoy
for
happiness
without
alloy
give
me
the
crystal
palace
home
notes
the
way
down
sydney
smith
or
napoleon
or
marcus
aurelius
somebody
about
that
time
said
that
after
ten
days
any
letter
would
answer
itself
you
see
what
he
meant
left
to
itself
your
invitation
from
the
duchess
to
lunch
next
tuesday
is
no
longer
a
matter
to
worry
about
by
wednesday
morning
you
were
either
there
or
not
there
it
is
unnecessary
to
write
now
and
say
that
a
previous
invitation
from
the
prime
minister
and
so
on
it
was
napoleon
idea
or
johnson
or
mark
antony
one
of
that
circle
that
all
correspondence
can
be
treated
in
this
manner
i
have
followed
these
early
masters
or
whichever
one
it
was
to
the
best
of
my
ability
at
any
given
moment
in
the
last
few
years
there
have
been
ten
letters
that
i
absolutely
write
thirty
which
i
to
write
and
fifty
which
any
other
person
in
my
position
have
written
probably
i
have
written
two
after
all
when
your
profession
is
writing
you
have
some
excuse
for
demanding
a
change
of
occupation
in
your
leisure
hours
no
doubt
if
i
were
a
by
day
my
wife
would
see
to
the
fire
after
dinner
while
i
wrote
letters
as
it
is
she
does
the
correspondence
while
i
gaze
into
the
fire
and
think
about
things
you
will
say
no
doubt
that
this
was
all
very
well
before
the
war
but
that
in
the
army
a
little
writing
would
be
a
pleasant
change
after
the
day
duties
allow
me
to
disillusion
you
if
years
ago
i
had
ever
conceived
a
glorious
future
in
which
my
autograph
might
be
of
value
to
the
more
promiscuous
collectors
that
conception
has
now
been
shattered
four
years
in
the
army
has
absolutely
spoilt
the
market
even
were
i
revered
in
the
year
as
shakespeare
is
revered
now
my
autographs
scattered
so
lavishly
on
passes
chits
requisitions
indents
and
applications
would
keep
the
price
at
a
dead
level
of
about
ten
a
penny
no
i
have
had
enough
of
writing
in
the
army
and
i
never
want
to
sign
my
own
name
again
yours
sincerely
herbert
asquith
faithfully
yours
jellicoe
these
by
all
means
but
not
my
own
however
i
wrote
a
letter
in
the
third
year
of
the
war
it
was
to
the
bank
it
informed
the
manager
that
i
had
arrived
in
london
from
france
and
should
be
troubling
them
again
shortly
london
being
to
all
appearances
an
expensive
place
it
also
called
attention
to
my
new
address
a
small
furnished
flat
in
which
celia
and
i
could
just
turn
round
if
we
did
it
separately
when
it
was
written
then
came
the
question
of
posting
it
i
was
all
for
waiting
till
the
next
morning
but
celia
explained
that
there
was
actually
a
letterbox
on
our
own
floor
twenty
yards
down
the
passage
i
took
the
letter
along
and
dropped
it
into
the
slit
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
it
went
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
i
listened
intently
hoping
for
more
but
that
was
all
deeply
disappointed
that
it
was
over
but
absolutely
thrilled
with
my
discovery
i
hurried
back
to
celia
any
letters
you
want
posted
i
said
in
an
way
no
thank
you
she
said
have
you
written
any
while
we
been
here
i
do
think
i
had
anything
to
write
i
think
i
said
reproachfully
it
quite
time
you
wrote
to
your
your
bank
or
your
mother
or
somebody
she
looked
at
me
and
seemed
to
be
struggling
for
words
i
know
exactly
what
you
going
to
say
i
said
but
do
say
it
write
a
little
letter
instead
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
just
write
a
note
to
the
laundress
to
the
laundress
i
said
of
course
just
a
note
when
it
was
written
i
insisted
on
her
coming
with
me
to
post
it
with
great
generosity
i
allowed
her
to
place
it
in
the
slit
a
delightful
thing
happened
it
went
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
right
down
to
the
in
the
hall
two
flipperties
a
floor
a
simple
calculation
shows
that
we
are
perched
on
the
fifth
floor
i
am
glad
now
that
we
live
so
high
it
must
be
very
dull
to
be
on
the
fourth
floor
with
only
eight
flipperties
unbearable
to
be
on
the
first
with
only
two
how
said
celia
now
do
you
think
you
ought
to
write
to
your
mother
oh
i
she
wrote
we
posted
it
it
went
however
you
know
all
about
that
now
since
this
great
discovery
of
mine
life
has
been
a
more
pleasurable
business
we
feel
now
that
there
are
romantic
possibilities
about
letters
setting
forth
on
their
journey
from
our
floor
to
start
life
with
so
many
flipperties
might
lead
to
anything
each
time
that
we
send
a
letter
off
we
listen
in
a
tremble
of
excitement
for
the
final
flop
and
when
it
comes
i
think
we
both
feel
vaguely
that
we
are
still
waiting
for
something
we
are
waiting
to
hear
some
magic
letter
go
flipperty
flipperty
and
behold
there
is
no
flop
and
still
it
goes
on
flipperty
flipperty
growing
fainter
in
the
distance
until
it
arrives
at
some
wonderland
of
its
own
one
day
it
must
happen
so
for
we
can
not
listen
always
for
that
flop
and
hear
it
always
nothing
in
this
world
is
as
inevitable
as
that
one
day
we
shall
look
at
each
other
with
awe
in
our
faces
and
say
but
it
still
flipperting
and
from
that
time
forward
the
hill
of
campden
will
be
a
place
holy
and
enchanted
perhaps
on
midsummer
eve
at
any
rate
i
am
sure
that
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
to
post
a
letter
to
father
christmas
well
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
if
i
have
been
a
bad
correspondent
in
the
past
i
am
a
good
one
now
and
celia
who
was
always
a
good
one
is
a
better
one
it
takes
at
least
ten
letters
a
day
to
satisfy
us
and
we
prefer
to
catch
ten
different
posts
with
the
ten
in
your
hand
together
there
is
always
a
temptation
to
waste
them
in
one
wild
rush
of
flipperties
all
catching
each
other
up
it
would
be
a
great
moment
but
i
do
not
think
we
can
afford
it
yet
we
must
wait
until
we
get
more
practised
at
and
even
then
i
am
doubtful
for
it
might
be
that
lost
in
the
confusion
of
that
one
wild
rush
the
magic
letter
would
start
on
its
way
to
the
and
we
should
forever
have
missed
it
so
friends
acquaintances
yes
and
even
strangers
i
beg
you
now
to
give
me
another
chance
i
will
answer
your
letters
how
gladly
i
still
think
that
napoleon
or
canute
or
the
younger
pliny
one
of
the
took
a
perfectly
correct
view
of
his
correspondence
but
then
never
had
a
which
went
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
flipperty
heavy
work
every
now
and
then
doctors
slap
me
about
and
ask
me
if
i
was
always
as
thin
as
this
as
thin
as
what
i
say
with
as
much
dignity
as
is
possible
to
a
man
who
has
had
his
shirt
taken
away
from
him
as
thin
as
this
says
the
doctor
hooking
his
stethoscope
on
to
one
of
my
ribs
and
then
going
round
to
the
other
side
to
see
how
i
am
getting
on
there
i
am
slightly
better
on
the
other
side
but
he
runs
his
pencil
up
and
down
me
and
produces
that
pleasing
noise
which
small
boys
get
by
dragging
a
stick
along
railings
i
explain
that
i
was
always
delicately
slender
but
that
latterly
my
ribs
have
been
overdoing
it
you
must
put
on
more
flesh
he
says
sternly
running
his
pencil
up
and
down
them
again
he
must
have
been
a
great
nuisance
as
a
small
boy
i
will
i
say
fervently
i
will
satisfied
by
my
promise
he
gives
me
back
my
shirt
but
it
is
not
only
the
doctor
who
complains
celia
is
even
more
upset
by
it
she
says
tearfully
that
i
remind
her
of
a
herring
unfortunately
she
does
not
like
herrings
it
is
my
hope
some
day
to
remind
her
of
a
turbot
and
make
her
happy
she
too
has
my
promise
that
i
will
put
on
flesh
we
had
a
fortnight
leave
a
little
while
ago
which
seemed
to
give
me
a
good
opportunity
of
putting
some
on
so
we
retired
to
a
house
in
the
country
where
there
is
a
in
the
bathroom
we
felt
that
the
mere
sight
of
this
twice
daily
would
stimulate
the
gaps
between
my
ribs
they
would
realize
that
they
had
been
brought
down
there
on
business
the
first
morning
i
weighed
myself
just
before
stepping
into
the
water
when
i
got
down
to
breakfast
i
told
celia
the
result
you
a
herring
she
said
sadly
but
think
what
an
opportunity
it
gives
me
if
i
started
the
right
weight
the
rest
of
the
fortnight
would
be
practically
wasted
by
the
way
the
doctor
talks
about
putting
on
flesh
but
he
did
say
how
much
he
wanted
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
nice
amount
about
another
stone
said
celia
you
were
just
a
nice
size
before
the
war
all
right
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
the
this
is
a
job
i
ca
do
it
all
myself
the
next
morning
i
was
the
same
as
before
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
really
said
celia
pathetically
we
might
just
as
well
have
gone
to
a
house
where
there
was
a
at
all
i
do
believe
trying
are
you
sure
you
stand
on
it
long
enough
long
enough
for
me
it
a
bit
cold
you
know
well
make
quite
sure
i
must
have
you
not
quite
so
herringy
i
made
quite
sure
the
next
morning
i
had
eight
stone
and
a
half
on
the
weight
part
and
was
on
the
notch
and
the
bar
balanced
midway
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
to
have
had
a
crowd
in
to
see
would
have
been
quite
unnecessary
the
whole
machine
was
shouting
as
loudly
as
it
could
i
expect
it
got
used
to
you
said
celia
when
i
told
her
the
sad
state
of
affairs
it
likes
people
we
will
give
it
i
said
one
more
chance
next
morning
the
weights
were
as
i
had
left
them
and
i
stepped
on
without
much
hope
expecting
that
the
bar
would
come
slowly
up
to
its
midway
position
of
rest
to
my
immense
delight
however
it
never
hesitated
but
went
straight
up
to
the
top
at
last
i
had
put
on
flesh
very
delicately
i
moved
to
its
next
notch
still
the
bar
stayed
at
the
top
i
had
put
on
at
least
another
ounce
of
flesh
i
continued
to
put
on
more
ounces
still
the
bar
remained
up
i
was
good
heavens
i
was
i
pushed
back
to
the
zero
position
and
exchanged
the
weight
for
a
stone
one
excited
but
a
trifle
cold
for
it
was
a
fresh
morning
and
the
upper
part
of
the
window
was
wide
open
i
went
up
from
nine
stone
ounce
by
ounce
at
i
jumped
off
for
a
moment
and
shut
the
window
at
i
had
to
get
off
again
in
order
to
attend
to
the
bath
which
was
in
danger
of
overflowing
at
the
breakfast
gong
went
at
i
realized
that
i
had
overdone
it
however
i
decided
to
know
the
worst
the
worst
that
the
machine
could
tell
me
was
at
i
left
it
celia
who
had
nearly
finished
breakfast
looked
up
eagerly
as
i
came
in
well
she
said
i
am
sorry
i
am
late
i
apologized
but
i
have
been
putting
on
flesh
have
you
really
gone
up
she
asked
excitedly
yes
i
began
mechanically
to
help
myself
to
porridge
and
then
stopped
no
perhaps
not
i
said
thoughtfully
have
you
gone
up
much
much
i
said
quite
much
how
much
quick
celia
i
said
sadly
i
am
i
may
be
more
the
gave
out
then
oh
but
darling
that
much
too
much
still
it
what
we
came
here
for
i
pointed
out
no
no
bacon
thanks
a
small
piece
of
dry
toast
i
suppose
the
machine
could
have
made
a
mistake
it
seemed
very
decided
about
it
it
did
hesitate
at
all
just
try
again
after
breakfast
to
make
sure
perhaps
i
better
try
now
i
said
getting
up
because
if
i
turned
out
to
be
only
i
might
venture
on
a
little
porridge
after
all
i
sha
be
long
i
went
upstairs
i
did
dare
face
that
in
my
clothes
after
the
way
in
which
i
had
already
strained
it
without
them
i
took
them
off
hurriedly
and
stepped
on
to
my
joy
the
bar
stayed
in
its
downward
position
i
took
off
an
ounce
then
another
ounce
the
bar
remained
down
at
i
jumped
off
for
a
moment
in
order
to
shut
the
window
which
some
careless
housemaid
had
opened
again
at
i
shouted
through
the
door
to
celia
that
i
should
be
long
and
that
i
should
want
the
porridge
after
all
at
i
said
that
i
had
better
have
an
egg
or
two
as
well
at
three
ounces
i
stepped
off
feeling
rather
shaken
i
have
not
used
the
since
partly
because
i
do
not
believe
it
is
trustworthy
partly
because
i
spent
the
rest
of
my
leave
in
bed
with
a
severe
cold
we
are
now
in
london
again
where
i
am
putting
on
flesh
at
least
the
doctor
who
slapped
me
about
yesterday
said
that
i
must
and
i
promised
him
that
i
would
the
patriot
this
is
a
true
story
unless
you
promise
to
believe
me
it
is
not
much
good
my
going
on
you
promise
very
well
years
ago
i
bought
a
pianola
i
went
into
the
shop
to
buy
a
gramophone
record
and
i
came
out
with
a
pianola
so
was
the
manager
you
would
think
that
one
could
then
retire
into
private
life
for
a
little
but
it
is
only
the
beginning
there
is
the
to
be
purchased
the
library
subscription
the
tuner
fee
four
visits
a
year
if
you
please
the
cabinet
for
the
rolls
the
man
to
oil
the
pedals
the
however
one
gets
out
of
the
shop
at
last
nor
do
i
regret
my
venture
it
is
common
talk
that
my
pianola
was
the
chief
thing
about
me
which
attracted
celia
i
marry
a
man
with
a
pianola
she
said
and
there
was
i
and
here
in
fact
we
are
my
blessings
then
on
the
golden
tongue
of
the
manager
now
there
is
something
very
charming
in
a
proper
modesty
about
attainments
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
attainments
should
be
generally
recognized
first
it
was
admirable
in
stephenson
to
have
said
as
i
am
sure
he
did
when
they
congratulated
him
on
his
first
it
nothing
but
he
could
only
say
this
so
long
as
the
others
were
in
a
position
to
offer
the
congratulations
in
order
to
place
you
in
that
position
i
must
let
you
know
how
extraordinarily
well
i
played
the
pianola
i
brought
to
my
interpretation
of
different
ops
an
a
a
ne
sais
and
several
other
french
words
which
were
the
astonishment
of
all
who
listened
to
me
but
chiefly
i
was
famous
for
my
playing
of
one
piece
the
charge
of
the
uhlans
by
karl
bohm
others
may
have
seen
venice
by
moonlight
or
heard
the
vicar
daughter
recite
little
jim
but
the
favoured
few
who
have
been
present
when
bohm
and
i
were
collaborating
are
the
ones
who
have
really
lived
indeed
even
the
coldest
professional
critic
would
have
spoken
of
it
as
a
noteworthy
rendition
the
charge
of
the
uhlans
if
you
came
to
see
me
you
had
to
hear
it
as
arranged
for
the
pianola
it
was
marked
to
be
played
throughout
at
a
lightning
pace
and
with
the
loudest
pedal
on
so
one
would
play
it
if
one
wished
to
annoy
the
man
in
the
flat
below
but
a
true
musician
has
i
take
it
a
higher
aim
i
disregarded
the
ff
and
the
other
on
the
way
and
gave
it
my
own
interpretation
as
played
by
me
the
charge
of
the
uhlans
became
a
whole
battle
scene
indeed
it
was
necessary
before
i
began
that
i
should
turn
to
my
audience
and
describe
the
scene
to
them
in
the
manner
but
not
in
the
words
of
a
queen
hall
programme
er
first
of
all
you
hear
the
cavalry
galloping
past
and
then
there
a
short
hymn
before
action
while
they
form
up
and
then
comes
the
charge
and
then
there
a
slow
bit
while
they
er
pick
up
the
wounded
and
then
they
trot
slowly
back
again
and
if
you
listen
carefully
to
the
last
bit
you
actually
hear
the
horses
limping
something
like
that
i
would
say
and
it
might
happen
that
an
insufferable
guest
who
never
got
asked
again
would
object
that
the
hymn
part
was
unusual
in
real
warfare
they
sang
it
in
this
piece
anyhow
i
would
say
stiffly
and
turn
my
back
on
him
and
begin
but
the
war
put
a
stop
to
music
as
to
many
other
things
for
years
the
pianola
was
not
played
by
either
of
us
we
had
other
things
to
do
and
in
our
case
curiously
enough
absence
from
the
pianola
did
not
make
the
heart
grow
fonder
on
the
contrary
we
seemed
to
lose
our
taste
for
music
and
when
at
last
we
were
restored
to
our
pianola
we
found
that
we
had
grown
out
of
it
it
very
ugly
announced
celia
we
ca
help
our
looks
i
said
in
my
grandmother
voice
a
would
be
much
prettier
there
but
not
so
tuneful
a
pianola
is
tuneful
if
you
never
play
it
true
i
said
celia
then
became
very
alluring
and
suggested
that
i
might
find
somebody
who
would
like
to
be
lent
a
delightful
pianola
by
somebody
whose
delightful
wife
had
her
eye
on
a
delightful
bookcase
i
might
i
said
somebody
said
celia
who
is
supplied
with
music
from
below
i
found
john
he
was
quite
pleased
with
the
idea
and
promised
to
return
the
pianola
when
he
got
sick
of
it
so
on
wednesday
it
went
i
was
not
sorry
because
in
its
silence
it
was
far
from
beautiful
and
we
wanted
another
badly
but
on
tuesday
evening
its
last
hours
with
us
i
had
to
confess
to
a
certain
melancholy
it
is
sad
to
part
with
an
old
and
friend
particularly
when
that
friend
is
almost
entirely
responsible
for
your
marriage
i
looked
at
the
pianola
and
then
i
said
to
celia
i
must
play
it
once
again
please
said
celia
the
old
masterpiece
i
suppose
i
said
as
i
got
it
out
do
you
think
you
ought
to
now
i
do
think
i
want
to
hear
a
charge
of
the
uhlans
beasts
i
want
a
charge
of
our
own
men
art
i
said
grandly
knows
no
frontiers
i
suppose
this
has
been
said
by
several
people
several
times
already
but
for
the
moment
both
celia
and
i
thought
it
was
rather
clever
so
i
placed
the
roll
in
the
pianola
sat
down
and
began
to
play
ah
the
dear
old
tune
dash
it
all
what
happened
said
celia
breaking
a
silence
which
had
become
alarming
i
must
have
put
it
in
wrong
i
said
i
wound
the
roll
off
put
it
in
again
and
tried
a
second
time
pedalling
vigorously
dead
silence
hush
a
note
another
silence
and
then
another
note
i
pedalled
through
to
the
end
about
five
notes
sounded
celia
i
said
this
is
wonderful
it
really
was
wonderful
for
the
first
time
in
its
life
my
pianola
refused
to
play
the
charge
of
the
uhlans
it
had
played
it
a
hundred
times
before
the
war
but
now
no
we
had
to
have
a
farewell
piece
i
put
in
a
waltz
and
it
played
it
perfectly
then
we
said
to
our
pianola
feeling
a
reverence
for
it
which
we
had
never
felt
before
you
do
believe
this
yet
you
promised
you
would
and
i
still
assure
you
that
it
is
true
but
i
admit
that
the
truth
is
sometimes
hard
to
believe
and
the
first
six
persons
to
whom
i
told
the
story
assured
me
frankly
that
i
was
a
liar
if
one
is
to
be
called
a
liar
one
may
as
well
make
an
effort
to
deserve
the
name
i
made
an
effort
therefore
with
the
seventh
person
i
put
in
charge
of
the
uhlans
i
said
and
it
played
save
the
king
unfortunately
he
was
a
very
patriotic
man
and
he
believed
it
so
that
is
how
the
story
is
now
going
about
but
you
who
read
this
know
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
a
question
of
light
as
soon
as
celia
had
got
a
of
her
own
and
i
had
explained
the
mysteries
of
to
her
she
looked
round
for
a
safe
investment
of
her
balance
which
amounted
to
several
pounds
my
offers
first
of
an
old
stocking
and
afterwards
of
mines
mortgages
and
aerated
breads
were
rejected
at
once
i
leave
a
little
in
the
bank
in
case
of
accidents
she
said
and
the
rest
must
go
somewhere
absolutely
safe
and
earn
me
five
per
cent
otherwise
they
sha
have
it
we
did
what
we
could
for
her
we
offered
the
money
to
archdeacons
and
other
men
of
pronounced
probity
and
finally
we
invested
it
in
the
blanktown
electric
light
company
blanktown
is
not
its
real
name
of
course
but
i
do
not
like
to
let
out
any
information
which
may
be
of
value
to
celia
enemies
the
wicked
ones
who
are
trying
to
snatch
her
little
fortune
from
her
the
world
we
feel
is
a
dangerous
place
for
a
young
woman
with
money
ca
i
lose
it
now
she
asked
only
in
two
ways
i
said
blanktown
might
disappear
in
the
night
or
the
inhabitants
might
give
up
using
electric
light
it
seemed
safe
enough
at
the
same
time
we
watched
the
newspapers
anxiously
for
details
of
the
latest
inventions
and
anybody
who
happened
to
mention
when
dining
with
us
that
he
was
experimenting
with
a
new
and
powerful
illuminant
was
handed
his
hat
at
once
you
have
blanktown
then
as
the
depository
of
celia
fortune
now
it
comes
on
the
scene
in
another
guise
i
made
the
announcement
with
some
pride
at
breakfast
yesterday
my
dear
i
said
i
have
been
asked
to
deliver
a
lecture
whatever
on
asked
celia
anything
i
like
the
last
person
lectured
on
minor
satellites
of
jupiter
and
the
one
who
comes
after
me
is
doing
architecture
of
the
byzantine
period
so
i
can
take
something
in
between
like
said
celia
helpfully
but
i
do
quite
understand
where
is
it
and
why
the
blanktown
literary
and
philosophical
society
ask
me
to
lecture
to
them
at
blanktown
the
man
who
was
coming
is
but
why
particularly
one
comes
down
to
me
in
the
end
i
said
modestly
i
expect
it
because
of
my
electric
lights
do
they
give
you
any
money
for
it
they
ask
me
to
name
my
fee
then
say
a
thousand
pounds
and
lecture
on
the
need
for
more
electric
light
fancy
if
i
got
six
per
cent
this
is
a
very
sordid
conversation
i
said
if
i
agree
to
lecture
at
all
it
will
be
simply
because
i
feel
that
i
have
a
message
to
deliver
i
will
now
retire
into
the
library
and
consider
what
that
message
is
to
be
i
placed
the
encyclopaedia
handy
and
sat
down
at
my
desk
i
had
already
grasped
the
fact
that
the
title
of
my
discourse
was
the
important
thing
in
the
list
of
the
society
lectures
sent
to
me
there
was
hardly
one
whose
title
did
not
impress
the
imagination
in
advance
i
must
be
equally
impressive
after
a
little
thought
i
began
to
write
wasps
and
their
young
delivered
before
the
blanktown
literary
and
philosophical
society
tuesday
december
and
well
said
celia
drifting
in
how
it
going
i
showed
her
how
far
i
had
got
i
thought
you
always
began
lord
mayor
ladies
and
gentlemen
she
said
only
if
the
lord
mayor
there
but
how
will
you
know
yes
that
rather
awkward
i
shall
have
to
ask
the
secretary
beforehand
i
began
again
wasps
and
their
young
delivered
lord
mayor
my
lords
ladies
and
it
looked
much
better
what
about
baronets
said
celia
there
sure
to
be
lots
yes
this
is
going
to
be
difficult
i
shall
have
to
have
a
long
talk
with
the
secretary
how
this
lord
mayor
lords
baronets
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
sundries
that
got
in
everybody
that
all
right
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
have
you
got
any
lantern
slides
they
not
necessary
but
they
much
more
fun
perhaps
they
have
some
old
ones
of
vesuvius
you
can
work
in
well
and
she
drifted
out
i
went
on
thinking
no
i
said
to
myself
i
on
the
wrong
tack
so
i
began
again
some
yorkshire
delivered
before
the
blanktown
literary
and
philosophical
society
tuesday
december
lord
mayor
my
i
do
want
to
interrupt
said
celia
coming
in
suddenly
but
oh
what
a
a
curious
underground
cavern
sometimes
found
in
the
north
are
caverns
always
underground
but
you
busy
will
you
be
in
for
lunch
i
shall
be
writing
my
lecture
all
day
i
said
busily
at
lunch
i
decided
to
have
a
little
financial
talk
with
celia
what
i
feel
is
this
i
said
at
most
i
can
ask
ten
guineas
for
my
lecture
now
my
expense
all
the
way
to
the
north
with
a
night
at
an
hotel
will
be
at
least
five
pounds
profit
said
celia
not
bad
ah
but
wait
i
have
never
spoken
in
public
before
in
an
immense
hall
whose
acoustics
who
are
they
well
never
mind
what
i
mean
is
that
i
shall
want
some
elocution
lessons
say
five
at
a
guinea
each
that
still
leaves
five
shillings
if
only
it
left
that
it
might
be
worth
it
but
there
a
new
white
waistcoat
an
audience
soon
gets
tired
of
a
lecture
and
then
nothing
for
the
wakeful
ones
to
concentrate
on
but
the
white
waistcoat
of
the
lecturer
it
must
be
of
a
virgin
whiteness
say
shillings
so
i
lose
thirty
shillings
by
it
can
i
afford
so
much
but
you
gain
the
acoustics
and
the
waistcoat
true
of
course
if
you
insist
oh
you
said
celia
so
i
returned
to
the
library
by
i
had
got
as
far
as
this
adventures
with
a
camera
in
somaliland
delivered
before
the
blanktown
literary
and
and
then
i
had
an
idea
this
time
a
brilliant
one
celia
i
said
at
tea
i
have
been
wondering
whether
i
ought
to
take
advantage
of
your
generosity
what
generosity
in
letting
me
deliver
this
lecture
it
is
generosity
it
swank
i
want
to
be
able
to
tell
everybody
ah
but
the
sacrifices
you
are
making
am
i
said
celia
with
interest
of
course
you
are
consider
i
ask
a
fee
of
ten
guineas
they
can
not
possibly
charge
more
than
a
shilling
a
head
to
listen
to
me
it
would
be
robbery
so
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
profit
at
all
as
presumably
they
anticipate
i
shall
have
a
gate
of
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
i
should
so
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
at
on
the
night
of
december
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
residents
of
blanktown
will
out
the
electric
lights
in
their
perhaps
even
in
their
halls
and
proceed
to
the
true
the
will
be
lit
up
a
small
compensation
but
not
for
long
when
the
slides
of
vesuvius
are
thrown
upon
the
screen
celia
was
going
pale
but
if
it
not
you
she
faltered
it
will
be
somebody
else
no
if
i
refuse
it
will
be
too
late
then
to
get
a
substitute
besides
they
must
have
tried
everybody
else
before
they
got
down
to
me
celia
it
is
noble
of
you
to
sacrifice
do
go
she
cried
in
anguish
i
gave
a
deep
sigh
for
your
sake
i
said
i
wo
so
that
settles
it
if
my
lecture
on
first
principles
in
homoeopathy
is
ever
to
be
delivered
it
must
be
delivered
elsewhere
enter
bingo
before
i
introduce
bingo
i
must
say
a
word
for
humphrey
his
sparring
partner
humphrey
found
himself
on
the
top
of
my
stocking
last
december
put
there
i
fancy
by
celia
though
she
says
it
was
father
christmas
he
is
a
small
yellow
dog
with
glass
optics
and
the
label
round
his
neck
said
his
eyes
move
when
i
had
finished
the
oranges
and
sweets
and
nuts
when
celia
and
i
had
pulled
the
crackers
humphrey
remained
over
to
sit
on
the
with
the
air
of
one
playing
the
pianola
in
this
position
he
found
his
uses
there
are
times
when
a
husband
may
legitimately
be
annoyed
at
these
times
it
was
pleasant
to
kick
humphrey
off
his
stool
on
to
the
divan
to
stand
on
the
divan
and
kick
him
on
to
the
sofa
to
stand
on
the
sofa
and
kick
him
on
to
the
bookcase
and
then
feeling
another
man
to
replace
him
on
the
and
apologize
to
celia
it
was
thus
that
he
lost
his
tail
here
we
say
to
humphrey
for
the
present
bingo
claims
our
attention
bingo
arrived
as
an
absurd
little
black
tub
of
puppiness
warranted
by
a
pedigree
as
long
as
your
arm
to
grow
into
a
pekinese
it
was
celia
idea
to
call
him
bingo
because
a
ridiculous
reason
as
a
child
she
had
had
a
poodle
called
bingo
the
less
said
about
poodles
the
better
why
rake
up
the
past
if
there
is
the
slightest
chance
of
bingo
of
this
animal
growing
up
into
a
poodle
i
said
he
leaves
my
house
at
once
poodle
said
celia
was
a
lovely
dog
of
course
she
was
only
a
child
then
she
would
know
the
point
is
this
i
said
firmly
our
puppy
is
meant
for
a
pekinese
the
pedigree
says
so
from
the
look
of
him
it
will
be
touch
and
go
whether
he
pulls
it
off
to
call
him
by
the
name
of
a
late
poodle
may
just
be
the
deciding
factor
now
i
hate
poodles
i
hate
pet
dogs
a
pekinese
is
not
a
pet
dog
he
is
an
undersized
lion
our
puppy
may
grow
into
a
small
lion
or
a
mastiff
or
anything
like
that
but
i
will
have
him
a
poodle
if
we
call
him
bingo
will
you
promise
never
to
mention
in
his
presence
that
you
once
had
a
a
you
know
what
i
mean
called
bingo
she
promised
i
have
forgiven
her
for
having
once
loved
a
poodle
i
beg
you
to
forget
about
it
there
is
now
only
one
bingo
and
he
is
a
pekinese
puppy
however
after
we
had
decided
to
call
him
bingo
a
difficulty
arose
bingo
pedigree
is
full
of
names
like
li
hung
chang
and
sun
yat
sen
had
we
chosen
a
sufficiently
chinese
name
for
him
apart
from
what
was
due
to
his
ancestors
were
we
encouraging
him
enough
to
grow
into
a
pekinese
what
was
there
oriental
about
bingo
in
itself
apparently
little
and
bingo
himself
must
have
felt
this
for
his
tail
continued
to
be
nothing
but
a
rat
tail
and
his
body
to
be
nothing
but
a
fat
tub
and
his
head
to
be
almost
the
head
of
any
little
puppy
in
the
world
he
felt
it
deeply
when
i
ragged
him
about
it
he
tried
to
eat
my
ankles
i
had
only
to
go
into
the
room
in
which
he
was
and
murmur
rat
tail
to
myself
or
more
offensive
still
chewed
string
for
him
to
rush
at
me
where
o
bingo
is
that
delicate
feather
curling
gracefully
over
the
back
which
was
the
pride
and
glory
of
thy
is
the
caudal
affix
of
the
rodent
thy
apology
for
it
and
bingo
would
whimper
with
shame
then
we
began
to
look
him
up
in
the
map
i
found
a
chinese
town
called
which
strikes
me
as
very
much
like
and
celia
found
another
one
called
which
might
just
as
well
be
the
obvious
name
of
bingo
heir
when
he
has
one
these
facts
being
communicated
to
bingo
his
nose
immediately
began
to
go
back
a
little
and
his
tub
to
develop
something
of
a
waist
but
what
finally
decided
him
was
a
discovery
of
mine
made
only
yesterday
is
a
japanese
province
called
japanese
not
chinese
it
is
true
but
at
least
it
is
oriental
in
any
case
conceive
one
pride
in
realizing
suddenly
that
one
has
been
called
after
a
province
and
not
after
a
poodle
it
has
determined
bingo
unalterably
to
grow
up
in
the
right
way
you
have
bingo
now
definitely
a
pekinese
that
being
so
i
may
refer
to
his
ancestors
always
an
object
of
veneration
among
these
easterns
i
speak
of
hats
off
please
ch
goodwood
lo
of
course
you
know
i
did
myself
till
last
week
that
ch
stands
for
champion
on
the
male
side
champion
goodwood
lo
is
on
the
female
side
the
same
animal
is
one
could
be
a
poodle
after
that
a
fortnight
after
bingo
came
to
us
we
found
in
a
pekinese
book
a
photograph
of
goodwood
lo
how
proud
we
all
were
then
we
saw
above
it
celebrities
of
the
past
the
late
champion
goodwood
lo
was
no
more
in
one
moment
bingo
had
lost
both
his
and
his
we
broke
it
to
him
as
gently
as
possible
but
the
double
shock
was
too
much
and
he
passed
the
evening
in
acute
depression
annoyed
with
my
tactlessness
in
letting
him
know
anything
about
it
i
kicked
humphrey
off
his
stool
humphrey
i
forgot
to
say
has
a
squeak
if
kicked
in
the
right
place
he
squeaked
bingo
at
that
time
still
uncertain
of
his
destiny
had
at
least
the
courage
of
the
lion
just
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
with
a
pounce
he
was
upon
humphrey
till
then
i
had
regarded
humphrey
save
for
his
power
of
rolling
the
eyes
and
his
habit
of
taking
long
jumps
from
the
to
the
as
rather
a
sedentary
character
but
in
the
fight
which
followed
he
put
up
an
amazingly
good
resistance
at
one
time
he
was
underneath
bingo
the
next
moment
he
had
bingo
down
first
one
then
the
other
seemed
to
gain
the
advantage
but
blood
will
tell
ancestry
is
unknown
i
blush
to
say
that
it
may
possibly
be
german
bingo
had
goodwood
lo
to
support
him
in
two
places
gradually
he
got
the
upper
hand
and
at
last
taking
the
reluctant
humphrey
by
the
ear
he
dragged
him
laboriously
beneath
the
sofa
he
emerged
alone
with
tail
wagging
and
was
taken
on
to
his
mistress
lap
there
he
slept
his
grief
forgotten
so
humphrey
was
found
a
job
whenever
bingo
wants
exercise
humphrey
plants
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
eyes
cast
upwards
in
an
affectation
of
innocence
i
just
sitting
here
says
humphrey
i
believe
there
a
fly
on
the
ceiling
it
is
a
challenge
which
no
of
goodwood
lo
could
resist
with
a
rush
bingo
is
at
him
i
learn
you
to
stand
in
my
way
he
splutters
and
the
great
begins
brave
little
bingo
i
do
wonder
that
so
warlike
a
race
as
the
japanese
has
called
a
province
after
him
a
warm
whatever
the
papers
say
it
was
the
hottest
afternoon
of
the
year
at
i
had
just
finished
dressing
after
my
third
cold
bath
since
lunch
when
celia
tapped
on
the
door
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
she
said
it
a
shame
to
ask
you
on
a
day
like
this
it
rather
a
shame
i
agreed
but
i
can
always
refuse
oh
but
you
must
we
have
got
any
ice
and
the
thompsons
are
coming
to
dinner
do
you
think
you
could
go
and
buy
threepennyworth
jane
busy
and
i
busy
and
and
i
busy
i
said
opening
and
shutting
a
drawer
with
great
rapidity
just
threepennyworth
she
pleaded
nice
cool
ice
think
of
sliding
home
on
it
well
of
course
it
had
to
be
done
i
took
my
hat
and
staggered
out
on
an
ordinary
cool
day
it
is
about
half
a
mile
to
the
fishmonger
it
was
about
two
miles
and
a
quarter
i
arrived
exhausted
and
with
only
just
strength
enough
to
kneel
down
and
press
my
forehead
against
the
large
block
of
ice
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
round
which
the
lobsters
nestled
here
you
must
do
that
said
the
fishmonger
waving
me
away
i
got
up
slightly
refreshed
i
want
i
said
some
and
then
a
thought
occurred
to
me
after
all
fishmongers
sell
ice
probably
the
large
block
in
front
of
me
was
just
a
trade
sign
like
the
coloured
bottles
at
the
chemist
suppose
i
said
to
a
fellow
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
i
want
some
of
that
green
stuff
in
the
window
he
would
only
laugh
the
tactful
thing
to
do
would
be
to
buy
a
pint
or
two
of
laudanum
first
and
having
established
pleasant
relations
ask
him
as
a
friend
to
lend
me
his
green
bottle
for
a
bit
so
i
said
to
the
fishmonger
i
want
some
some
nice
lobsters
how
many
would
you
like
one
i
said
we
selected
a
nice
one
between
us
and
he
wrapped
a
piece
of
daily
mail
round
it
leaving
only
the
whiskers
visible
and
gave
it
to
me
the
ice
being
now
broken
i
mean
the
ice
being
now
well
you
see
what
i
mean
i
was
now
in
a
position
to
ask
for
some
of
his
ice
i
wonder
if
you
could
let
me
have
a
little
piece
of
your
ice
i
ventured
how
much
ice
do
you
want
he
said
promptly
sixpennyworth
i
said
feeling
suddenly
that
celia
threepennyworth
sounded
rather
paltry
six
of
ice
bill
he
shouted
to
an
inferior
at
the
back
and
bill
tottered
up
with
a
block
about
the
size
of
one
of
the
lions
in
trafalgar
square
he
wrapped
a
piece
of
daily
news
round
it
and
gave
it
to
me
is
that
all
asked
the
fishmonger
that
is
all
i
said
faintly
and
with
algernon
the
overwhiskered
crustacean
firmly
clutched
in
the
right
hand
and
stonehenge
supported
on
the
palm
of
the
left
hand
i
retired
the
flat
seemed
a
very
long
way
away
but
having
bought
twice
as
much
ice
as
i
wanted
and
an
entirely
unnecessary
lobster
i
was
not
going
to
waste
still
more
money
in
taxis
hot
though
it
was
i
would
walk
for
some
miles
all
went
well
then
the
ice
began
to
drip
through
the
paper
and
in
a
little
while
the
underneath
part
of
the
daily
news
had
disappeared
altogether
tucking
the
lobster
under
my
arm
i
turned
the
block
over
so
that
it
rested
on
another
part
of
the
paper
soon
that
had
dissolved
too
by
the
time
i
had
got
our
radical
contemporary
had
been
entirely
eaten
fortunately
the
daily
mail
remained
but
to
get
it
i
had
to
disentangle
algernon
first
and
i
had
no
hand
available
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
i
put
the
block
of
ice
down
on
the
pavement
unwrapped
the
lobster
put
the
lobster
next
to
the
ice
spread
its
daily
mail
out
lifted
the
ice
on
to
the
paper
and
looked
up
and
saw
thompson
approaching
she
was
the
last
person
i
wanted
at
that
moment
in
an
hour
and
a
half
she
would
be
dining
with
us
algernon
would
not
be
dining
with
us
if
algernon
and
thompson
were
to
meet
now
would
she
not
be
expecting
him
to
turn
up
at
every
course
think
of
the
long
disappointment
for
her
not
even
lobster
sauce
there
was
no
time
to
lose
i
decided
to
abandon
the
ice
leaving
it
on
the
pavement
i
clutched
the
lobster
and
walked
hastily
back
the
way
i
had
come
by
the
time
i
had
shaken
off
thompson
i
was
almost
at
the
fishmonger
that
decided
me
i
would
begin
all
over
again
and
would
do
it
properly
this
time
i
want
three
of
ice
i
said
with
an
air
three
of
ice
bill
said
the
fishmonger
and
bill
gave
me
quite
a
respectable
segment
in
the
morning
post
and
i
want
a
taxi
i
said
and
i
waved
my
lobster
at
one
we
drove
quickly
home
but
as
we
neared
the
flat
i
suddenly
became
nervous
about
algernon
i
could
not
take
him
red
and
undraped
past
the
past
all
the
other
residents
who
might
spring
out
at
me
on
the
stairs
accordingly
i
placed
the
block
of
ice
on
the
seat
took
off
some
of
its
morning
post
and
wrapped
algernon
up
decently
then
i
sprang
out
gave
the
man
a
coin
and
hastened
into
the
building
bless
you
said
celia
have
you
got
it
how
sweet
of
you
and
she
took
my
parcel
from
me
now
we
shall
be
able
why
what
this
i
looked
at
it
closely
it
it
a
lobster
i
said
did
you
say
lobster
i
said
ice
oh
i
said
oh
i
did
understand
i
thought
you
said
lobster
you
ca
put
lobster
in
cider
cup
said
celia
severely
of
course
i
quite
see
that
it
was
foolish
of
me
however
it
pleasant
to
think
that
the
taxi
must
have
been
nice
and
cool
for
the
next
man
wrongly
attributed
you
heard
of
willy
ferrero
the
boy
conductor
a
musical
prodigy
seven
years
old
who
will
order
the
fifth
oboe
out
of
the
albert
hall
as
soon
as
look
at
him
well
he
has
a
rival
willy
as
perhaps
you
know
does
not
play
any
instrument
himself
he
only
conducts
his
rival
johnny
as
i
think
of
him
does
not
conduct
as
yet
at
least
not
audibly
his
line
is
the
actual
manipulation
of
the
pianoforte
the
paderewski
touch
johnny
lives
in
the
flat
below
and
i
hear
him
touching
on
certain
mornings
in
the
week
no
need
to
specify
them
i
enter
my
library
and
give
myself
up
to
literary
composition
on
the
same
mornings
little
johnny
enters
his
underneath
and
gives
himself
up
to
musical
composition
thus
we
are
at
work
together
the
worst
of
literary
composition
is
this
that
when
you
have
got
hold
of
what
you
feel
is
a
really
powerful
idea
you
find
suddenly
that
you
have
been
forestalled
by
some
earlier
writer
sophocles
or
shakespeare
or
george
sims
then
you
have
to
think
again
this
frequently
happens
to
me
upstairs
and
downstairs
poor
johnny
will
find
to
his
horror
one
day
that
his
great
work
has
already
been
given
to
the
world
by
another
a
certain
john
bull
johnny
in
fact
is
discovering
god
save
the
king
with
one
finger
as
i
dip
my
pen
in
the
ink
and
begin
to
write
johnny
strikes
up
on
the
first
day
when
this
happened
some
three
months
ago
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
stood
stiffly
through
the
performance
an
affair
of
some
minutes
owing
to
a
little
difficulty
with
send
him
victorious
a
line
which
always
bothers
johnny
however
he
got
right
through
it
at
last
after
harking
back
no
more
than
twice
and
i
sat
down
to
my
work
again
generally
speaking
god
save
the
king
ends
a
show
it
would
be
disloyal
to
play
any
other
tune
after
that
johnny
quite
saw
this
and
so
began
to
play
god
save
the
king
again
i
hope
that
his
majesty
the
lord
chamberlain
the
late
bull
or
whoever
is
most
concerned
will
sympathize
with
me
when
i
say
that
this
time
i
remained
seated
i
have
my
living
to
earn
from
that
day
johnny
has
interpreted
john
bull
favourite
composition
nine
times
every
morning
as
this
has
been
going
on
for
three
months
and
as
the
line
i
mentioned
has
two
special
rehearsals
to
itself
before
coming
out
right
you
can
easily
work
out
how
many
johnny
and
i
have
collaborated
in
about
two
thousand
very
well
now
you
ask
yourself
why
did
i
not
send
a
polite
note
to
johnny
father
asking
him
to
restrain
his
little
boy
from
begging
him
not
to
force
the
child
musical
genius
too
quickly
imploring
him
in
short
to
lock
up
the
piano
and
lose
the
key
what
kept
me
from
this
course
the
answer
is
patriotism
those
deep
feelings
for
his
country
which
one
man
will
express
glibly
by
rising
nine
times
during
the
morning
at
the
sound
of
the
national
anthem
another
will
direct
to
more
solid
uses
it
was
my
duty
i
felt
not
to
discourage
johnny
he
was
showing
qualities
which
could
not
fail
when
he
grew
up
to
be
of
value
to
the
nation
loyalty
musical
genius
determination
patience
industry
never
before
have
these
qualities
been
so
finely
united
in
a
child
of
six
was
i
to
say
a
single
word
to
disturb
the
delicate
balance
of
such
a
boy
mind
at
six
one
is
extraordinarily
susceptible
to
outside
influence
a
word
from
his
father
to
the
effect
that
the
gentleman
above
was
getting
sick
of
it
and
johnny
whole
life
might
be
altered
no
i
would
bear
it
grimly
and
then
yesterday
who
should
write
to
me
but
johnny
father
himself
this
was
the
letter
dear
sir
i
do
not
wish
to
interfere
unduly
in
the
affairs
of
the
other
occupants
of
these
flats
but
i
feel
bound
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
for
many
weeks
now
there
has
been
a
flow
of
water
from
your
bathroom
which
has
penetrated
through
the
ceiling
of
my
bathroom
particularly
after
you
have
been
using
the
room
in
the
mornings
may
i
therefore
beg
you
to
be
more
careful
in
future
not
to
splash
or
spill
water
on
your
floor
seeing
that
it
causes
inconvenience
to
the
tenants
beneath
you
yours
faithfully
jno
mcandrew
you
can
understand
how
i
felt
about
this
for
months
i
had
been
suffering
johnny
in
silence
yet
at
the
first
little
drop
of
water
from
above
johnny
father
must
break
out
into
violent
abuse
of
me
a
fine
reward
well
johnny
future
could
look
after
itself
now
anyhow
he
was
doomed
with
a
selfish
father
like
that
dear
sir
i
answered
defiantly
now
that
we
are
writing
to
each
other
i
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
for
many
months
past
there
has
been
a
constant
flow
of
music
from
your
little
boy
which
penetrates
through
the
floor
of
my
library
and
makes
all
work
impossible
may
i
beg
you
therefore
to
see
that
your
child
is
taught
a
new
tune
immediately
seeing
that
the
national
anthem
has
lost
its
first
freshness
for
the
tenants
above
him
his
reply
to
this
came
dear
sir
i
have
no
child
yours
faithfully
jno
mcandrew
i
was
so
staggered
that
i
could
only
think
of
one
adequate
retort
dear
sir
i
wrote
i
never
have
a
bath
so
that
the
end
of
johnny
my
boy
prodigy
for
whom
i
have
suffered
so
long
it
is
not
johnny
but
jno
who
struggles
with
the
national
anthem
he
will
give
up
music
now
for
he
knows
i
have
the
bulge
on
him
i
can
flood
his
bathroom
whenever
i
like
probably
he
will
learn
something
quieter
like
painting
anyway
john
bull
masterpiece
will
rise
no
more
through
the
ceiling
of
the
flat
below
on
referring
to
my
encyclopedia
i
see
that
according
to
some
authorities
god
save
the
king
is
wrongly
attributed
to
bull
well
i
wrongly
attributed
it
to
johnny
it
is
easy
to
make
these
mistakes
a
hanging
garden
in
babylon
are
you
taking
me
to
the
flower
show
this
afternoon
asked
celia
at
breakfast
no
i
said
thoughtfully
no
well
that
that
what
other
breakfast
conversation
have
i
have
you
been
to
any
theatres
lately
do
you
really
want
to
go
to
the
flower
show
i
asked
because
i
believe
i
could
bear
it
i
saved
up
two
shillings
it
is
that
not
only
that
but
there
be
thousands
of
people
there
all
with
gardens
of
their
own
all
pointing
to
things
and
saying
got
one
of
those
in
the
east
bed
or
that
look
nice
in
the
south
orchid
house
and
you
and
i
will
be
quite
quite
out
of
it
i
sighed
and
helped
myself
from
the
west
it
is
very
delightful
to
have
a
flat
in
london
but
there
are
times
in
the
summer
when
i
long
for
a
garden
of
my
own
i
show
people
round
our
little
place
and
i
point
out
hopefully
the
hot
tap
doultonii
in
the
scullery
and
the
dorothy
perkins
doormat
but
it
is
the
same
thing
as
taking
your
guest
round
your
garden
and
telling
him
that
what
you
really
want
is
rain
until
i
can
do
that
the
chelsea
flower
show
is
no
place
for
us
then
i
have
told
you
the
good
news
said
celia
we
gardeners
she
paused
a
moment
for
effect
i
have
ordered
a
i
dropped
the
marmalade
and
jumped
up
eagerly
but
this
is
glorious
news
i
have
been
so
excited
since
i
recognized
a
calceolaria
last
year
and
told
my
host
it
was
a
calceolaria
just
before
he
told
me
a
what
in
it
pink
geraniums
and
and
pink
geraniums
and
er
pink
geraniums
i
suggested
yes
they
very
pretty
you
know
i
know
but
i
could
have
wished
for
something
more
difficult
if
we
had
something
like
well
i
do
want
to
seem
to
harp
on
it
but
say
calceolarias
then
quite
a
lot
of
people
might
recognize
them
and
i
should
be
able
to
tell
them
what
they
were
i
should
be
able
to
show
them
the
calceolarias
you
ca
show
people
the
geraniums
you
can
say
do
you
think
of
for
a
geranium
said
celia
anyhow
she
added
you
got
to
take
me
to
the
flower
show
now
of
course
i
will
it
is
not
only
a
pleasure
but
a
duty
as
gardeners
we
must
keep
up
with
floricultural
progress
even
though
we
start
with
pink
geraniums
now
we
may
have
er
calceolarias
next
year
rotation
of
crops
and
what
not
accordingly
we
made
our
way
in
the
afternoon
to
the
show
i
think
we
a
little
i
said
as
we
paid
our
shillings
we
ought
to
look
as
if
we
just
run
up
from
our
little
in
the
country
and
were
going
back
by
the
last
train
i
should
be
in
gaiters
really
our
little
is
not
in
the
country
objected
celia
it
what
you
might
call
a
de
in
town
french
joke
she
added
kindly
much
more
difficult
than
the
ordinary
sort
do
forget
it
we
can
always
use
it
again
on
visitors
now
what
shall
we
look
at
first
the
flowers
first
then
the
tea
i
had
bought
a
catalogue
and
was
scanning
it
rapidly
we
do
want
flowers
i
said
our
our
garden
is
already
full
it
may
be
that
james
the
head
boxer
has
overdone
the
pink
geraniums
this
year
but
there
it
is
we
can
sack
him
and
promote
thomas
but
the
mischief
is
done
luckily
there
are
other
things
we
want
what
about
a
i
should
like
to
see
doves
cooing
round
our
geraniums
are
very
big
for
a
we
could
get
a
small
one
for
small
doves
do
you
have
to
buy
the
doves
too
or
do
they
just
come
i
never
know
or
there
i
broke
off
suddenly
my
dear
that
just
the
thing
and
i
pointed
with
my
stick
we
have
seven
clocks
already
said
celia
but
a
how
romantic
particularly
as
only
two
of
the
clocks
go
celia
if
you
let
me
have
a
in
my
i
would
meet
you
by
it
alone
sometimes
it
sounds
lovely
she
said
doubtfully
you
do
want
to
make
this
a
success
do
you
i
asked
as
we
wandered
on
well
then
help
me
to
buy
something
for
it
i
suggest
one
of
those
and
i
pointed
to
a
or
even
a
but
we
must
do
something
now
we
here
for
instance
what
about
one
of
these
patent
extension
ladders
in
case
the
geraniums
grow
very
tall
and
you
want
to
climb
up
and
smell
them
or
would
you
rather
have
some
mushroom
spawn
i
would
get
up
early
and
pick
the
mushrooms
for
breakfast
what
do
you
think
i
think
it
too
hot
for
anything
and
i
must
sit
down
is
this
seat
an
exhibit
or
is
it
meant
for
sitting
on
it
an
exhibit
but
we
might
easily
want
to
buy
one
some
day
when
our
gets
bigger
let
try
it
it
was
so
hot
that
i
think
if
the
man
in
charge
of
the
rustic
bench
section
had
tried
to
move
us
on
we
should
have
bought
the
seat
at
once
but
nobody
bothered
us
indeed
it
was
quite
obvious
that
the
news
that
we
owned
a
large
had
not
yet
got
about
i
shall
leave
you
here
i
said
after
i
had
smoked
a
cigarette
and
dipped
into
the
catalogue
again
and
make
my
purchase
it
will
be
quite
inexpensive
indeed
it
is
marked
in
the
catalogue
at
which
means
that
they
will
probably
offer
me
the
size
first
but
i
shall
be
firm
i
went
and
bought
one
and
returned
to
her
with
it
no
not
now
i
said
as
she
held
out
her
hand
eagerly
wait
till
we
get
home
it
was
cooler
now
and
we
wandered
through
the
tents
chatting
patronizingly
to
the
whenever
we
came
to
pink
geraniums
at
the
orchids
we
were
contemptuously
sniffy
of
course
i
said
for
those
who
orchids
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
geraniums
again
it
was
an
interesting
afternoon
and
to
our
great
joy
the
was
in
position
when
we
got
home
again
now
i
said
dramatically
and
i
unwrapped
my
purchase
and
placed
it
in
the
middle
of
our
garden
whatever
a
i
explained
proudly
but
how
could
slugs
get
up
here
asked
celia
in
surprise
how
do
slugs
get
anywhere
they
climb
up
the
walls
or
they
come
up
in
the
lift
or
they
get
blown
about
by
the
wind
i
do
know
they
can
fly
up
if
they
like
but
however
it
be
when
they
do
come
i
mean
to
be
ready
for
them
still
though
our
will
no
doubt
come
in
usefully
it
is
not
what
we
really
want
what
we
gardeners
really
want
is
rain
sisterly
assistance
i
was
talking
to
a
very
stupid
man
the
other
day
he
was
the
stupidest
man
i
have
come
across
for
many
years
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
any
man
but
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
entirely
lacking
in
intellect
it
was
celia
who
introduced
me
to
him
she
had
rung
up
her
brother
at
the
flat
where
he
was
staying
and
finding
that
he
was
out
she
gave
a
message
for
him
to
the
porter
it
was
simply
that
he
was
to
ring
her
up
as
soon
as
he
came
in
ring
up
who
said
the
porter
at
least
i
suppose
he
did
for
celia
repeated
her
name
and
mine
very
slowly
and
distinctly
mrs
who
said
the
porter
what
or
i
ca
hear
or
something
equally
foolish
celia
then
repeated
our
name
again
there
followed
a
long
conversation
between
the
two
of
them
the
audible
part
of
it
that
is
celia
consisting
of
my
name
given
forth
in
a
variety
of
intonations
in
the
manner
of
one
who
sings
an
anthem
hopefully
pathetically
dramatically
despairingly
up
to
this
moment
i
had
been
rather
attached
to
my
name
true
it
wants
a
little
explaining
to
shopkeepers
there
are
certain
consonants
in
it
which
require
to
be
elided
or
swallowed
or
swivelled
round
the
glottis
in
order
to
give
the
name
its
proper
due
but
after
five
or
six
applications
the
shopkeeper
grasps
one
meaning
well
as
i
say
i
was
attached
to
my
name
but
after
listening
to
celia
for
five
minutes
i
realized
that
there
had
been
some
horrible
mistake
people
were
called
that
just
wait
a
moment
i
said
to
her
rather
anxiously
and
picked
up
the
telephone
book
to
my
great
relief
i
found
that
celia
was
right
there
a
person
of
that
name
living
at
my
address
you
quite
right
i
said
go
on
i
wish
i
had
married
somebody
called
jones
said
celia
looking
up
at
me
rather
reproachfully
no
no
not
jones
she
added
hastily
down
the
telephone
and
once
more
she
repeated
the
unhappy
name
it
is
my
fault
i
protested
you
did
have
a
choice
i
had
none
try
spelling
it
it
spells
all
right
celia
tried
spelling
it
i
going
to
spell
it
she
announced
very
distinctly
down
the
telephone
are
you
ready
m
no
m
for
mother
that
gave
me
an
idea
come
away
i
said
seizing
the
telephone
leave
it
to
me
now
then
i
called
to
the
porter
never
mind
about
the
name
just
tell
him
to
ring
up
his
and
i
looked
at
celia
triumphantly
ask
him
to
ring
up
his
mother
said
the
porter
very
well
sir
no
not
the
mother
that
was
something
else
forget
all
about
that
mother
he
to
ring
up
his
sister
sister
you
have
to
spell
it
said
celia
i
going
to
spell
it
i
shouted
are
you
ready
for
for
sister
now
you
going
to
muddle
him
murmured
celia
s
for
sister
have
you
got
that
no
idiot
i
for
idiot
i
added
quickly
s
for
sister
this
is
another
sister
of
course
t
for
two
got
that
no
two
anything
two
more
sisters
if
you
like
e
for
e
for
i
turned
helplessly
to
celia
quick
a
word
to
begin
with
e
i
got
him
moving
now
e
for
quick
before
his
tympanum
runs
down
er
er
desperately
she
tried
to
think
e
for
er
i
shouted
that
be
another
sister
i
expect
celia
i
believe
we
ought
to
spell
it
with
an
ca
you
think
of
a
better
word
enny
said
celia
having
quite
lost
her
nerve
by
this
time
e
for
enny
i
shouted
any
anything
any
of
the
sisters
i
been
telling
you
about
r
for
quick
celia
rose
she
said
hastily
r
for
rose
i
shouted
rose
the
flower
or
the
sister
if
you
like
there
you
are
that
the
whole
word
now
then
i
just
spell
it
to
you
over
again
celia
i
want
another
word
for
that
last
was
a
bad
one
edith
good
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
s
for
sister
i
for
isabel
isabel
is
the
name
of
the
sister
s
for
another
sister
i
tell
you
name
directly
t
for
two
sisters
these
two
that
we
talking
about
e
for
edith
that
the
second
sister
whose
name
i
was
going
to
tell
you
r
for
rose
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
rose
she
was
the
sister
whom
these
two
sisters
were
sisters
of
got
that
i
turned
to
celia
i
going
to
get
the
sister
idea
into
his
head
if
i
die
for
it
just
a
moment
sir
said
the
dazed
voice
of
the
porter
what
the
matter
did
i
make
it
clear
about
rose
she
was
the
sister
whom
the
just
hold
the
line
a
moment
sir
implored
the
porter
here
the
gentleman
himself
coming
in
i
handed
the
telephone
to
celia
here
he
is
i
said
but
i
was
quite
sorry
to
go
for
i
was
getting
interested
in
those
sisters
rose
i
think
will
always
be
my
favourite
her
life
though
short
was
full
of
incident
and
there
were
many
things
about
her
which
i
could
have
told
that
porter
but
perhaps
he
would
not
have
appreciated
them
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
any
man
but
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
entirely
lacking
in
intellect
the
obvious
celia
had
been
calling
on
a
newly
married
friend
of
hers
they
had
been
schoolgirls
together
they
had
looked
over
the
same
algebra
book
or
whatever
it
was
that
celia
learnt
at
school
i
have
never
been
quite
certain
they
had
done
their
calisthenics
side
by
side
they
had
compared
picture
post
cards
of
lewis
waller
ah
me
the
fairy
princes
they
had
imagined
together
in
those
days
and
here
am
i
and
somewhere
in
the
city
i
believe
he
is
a
stockbroker
is
ermyntrude
husband
and
we
play
our
golf
on
saturday
afternoons
and
go
to
sleep
after
dinner
and
well
anyhow
they
were
both
married
and
celia
had
been
calling
on
ermyntrude
i
hope
you
did
all
the
right
things
i
said
asked
to
see
the
and
admired
the
charming
little
house
and
gave
a
few
hints
on
the
proper
way
to
manage
a
husband
rather
said
celia
but
it
did
seem
funny
because
she
used
to
be
older
than
me
at
school
is
she
still
oh
i
ever
so
much
older
now
talking
about
she
went
on
as
she
twisted
her
own
round
and
round
she
got
all
sorts
of
things
written
inside
hers
the
date
and
their
initials
and
i
know
what
else
there
ca
be
much
else
unless
perhaps
she
has
a
very
large
finger
well
i
have
got
in
mine
said
celia
mournfully
she
took
off
the
offending
ring
and
gave
it
to
me
on
the
day
when
i
first
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
celia
swore
an
oath
that
nothing
but
death
extreme
poverty
or
brigands
should
ever
remove
it
i
swore
too
unfortunately
it
fell
off
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
which
seemed
to
break
the
spell
somehow
so
now
it
goes
off
and
on
just
like
any
other
ring
i
took
it
from
her
and
looked
inside
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
here
too
i
said
really
you
do
seem
to
have
read
your
at
all
or
anyhow
you
been
skipping
there
nothing
said
celia
in
the
same
mournful
voice
i
do
think
you
might
have
put
something
i
went
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
held
the
ring
up
you
an
ungrateful
wife
i
said
after
all
the
trouble
i
took
now
look
there
and
i
pointed
with
a
pencil
what
the
first
thing
you
see
that
only
the
that
was
your
age
when
you
married
me
i
had
it
put
in
at
enormous
expense
if
you
had
been
eighteen
the
man
said
or
or
nine
it
would
have
come
much
cheaper
but
no
i
would
have
your
exact
age
you
were
and
that
what
i
had
engraved
on
it
very
well
now
what
do
you
see
next
to
it
a
crown
yes
and
what
does
that
mean
in
the
language
of
er
crowns
it
means
are
my
queen
i
insisted
on
a
crown
it
would
have
been
cheaper
to
have
had
a
lion
which
means
er
lions
but
i
was
determined
not
to
spare
myself
for
i
thought
i
went
on
pathetically
i
quite
thought
you
would
like
a
crown
oh
i
do
cried
celia
quickly
if
it
really
means
that
she
took
the
ring
in
her
hands
and
looked
at
it
lovingly
and
what
that
there
sort
of
a
man
head
i
gazed
at
her
sadly
you
do
recognize
it
has
a
year
of
marriage
so
greatly
changed
me
celia
it
is
your
ronald
i
sat
for
that
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
for
your
sake
celia
it
is
not
a
perfect
likeness
in
the
small
space
allotted
to
him
the
sculptor
has
hardly
done
me
justice
and
there
i
added
is
his
initial
oh
woman
the
amount
of
thought
i
spent
on
that
ring
she
came
a
little
closer
and
slipped
the
ring
on
my
finger
spend
a
little
more
she
pleaded
there
plenty
of
room
just
have
something
nice
written
in
it
something
about
you
and
me
like
what
does
that
mean
i
do
know
perhaps
it
or
or
sure
there
a
word
you
put
on
rings
i
expect
they
know
at
the
shop
but
i
do
want
what
they
know
at
shops
it
must
be
something
quite
private
and
special
but
the
shop
has
got
to
know
about
it
when
i
tell
them
and
i
do
like
telling
strange
men
in
shops
private
and
special
things
about
ourselves
i
love
you
celia
but
that
would
be
a
lovely
thing
she
said
clasping
her
hands
eagerly
what
love
you
celia
i
looked
at
her
aghast
do
you
want
me
to
order
that
in
cold
blood
from
the
shopman
he
would
mind
besides
if
he
saw
us
together
he
probably
know
you
are
afraid
of
a
goldsmith
are
you
i
not
afraid
of
any
goldsmith
living
or
goldfish
either
if
it
come
to
that
but
i
should
prefer
to
be
sentimental
in
some
other
language
than
plain
english
i
could
order
or
or
or
anything
like
that
without
a
tremor
but
of
course
you
shall
put
just
whatever
you
like
only
only
let
it
be
original
not
mizpahs
right
i
said
for
three
days
i
wandered
past
gold
and
silversmiths
with
the
ring
in
my
pocket
and
for
three
days
celia
went
about
without
a
and
for
all
i
know
without
even
her
in
her
muff
and
on
the
fourth
day
i
walked
boldly
in
i
want
i
said
a
engraved
and
i
felt
in
my
pockets
not
initials
i
said
and
i
felt
in
some
more
pockets
but
but
i
tried
the
trousers
pockets
again
well
look
here
i
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
er
want
i
fumbled
in
my
i
want
love
you
on
it
and
i
went
through
the
waistcoat
pockets
a
third
time
er
love
you
me
said
the
shopman
surprised
i
love
you
i
repeated
mechanically
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
well
look
here
perhaps
i
better
go
back
and
get
the
ring
on
the
next
day
i
was
there
again
but
there
was
a
different
man
behind
the
counter
i
want
this
ring
engraved
i
said
certainly
what
shall
we
put
i
had
felt
the
question
coming
i
had
a
sort
of
instinct
that
he
would
ask
me
that
but
i
could
get
the
words
out
again
well
i
hesitated
i
er
well
ladies
often
like
the
date
put
in
when
is
it
to
be
when
is
what
to
be
the
wedding
he
smiled
it
has
been
i
said
it
all
over
you
too
late
for
it
i
gave
myself
up
to
thought
at
all
costs
i
must
be
original
there
must
be
something
on
celia
that
had
never
been
in
any
other
there
was
only
one
thing
i
could
think
of
the
engraved
ring
arrived
as
we
were
at
tea
a
few
days
later
and
i
had
a
sudden
overwhelming
fear
that
celia
would
not
be
pleased
i
saw
that
i
must
explain
it
to
her
after
all
there
was
a
distinguished
precedent
come
into
the
a
moment
i
said
and
i
led
the
way
she
followed
wondering
what
is
that
i
asked
pointing
to
a
blue
thing
on
the
floor
the
she
said
surprised
and
what
is
written
on
it
why
of
course
of
course
i
said
and
i
handed
her
the
vi
a
few
guests
bad
lord
blight
a
moral
story
for
the
i
seated
in
the
library
of
blight
hall
john
blighter
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
and
gave
himself
up
to
despair
the
day
of
reckoning
had
come
were
appearances
not
so
deceptive
one
would
have
said
that
lord
blight
blight
as
he
was
known
familiarly
to
his
friends
was
a
man
to
be
envied
in
a
revolving
in
the
middle
of
the
spacious
library
were
countless
treasured
volumes
including
a
complete
edition
of
thackeray
outside
in
the
grounds
of
the
estate
was
a
new
a
bottle
of
sherry
freshly
uncorked
stood
upon
the
sideboard
in
the
but
worldly
possessions
are
not
everything
an
untroubled
mind
as
shakespeare
knew
even
if
he
did
actually
say
it
is
more
to
be
valued
than
riches
the
seventeenth
earl
of
mind
was
not
untroubled
his
conscience
was
gnawing
him
some
people
would
say
no
doubt
that
his
conscience
was
too
sensitive
true
there
were
episodes
in
his
past
life
of
which
in
later
years
he
could
not
wholly
approve
but
is
not
this
the
case
with
every
one
of
us
far
better
as
must
often
have
occurred
to
milton
to
strive
for
the
future
than
to
regret
the
past
ten
years
ago
lord
blight
had
been
plain
john
blighter
with
no
prospects
in
front
of
him
realizing
that
he
could
expect
little
help
from
others
he
decided
to
push
for
himself
he
began
by
pushing
three
cousins
over
the
cliffs
at
scarborough
thus
becoming
second
heir
to
the
earldom
a
week
later
he
pushed
an
elder
brother
over
the
same
cliff
and
was
openly
referred
to
in
the
press
as
the
next
bearer
of
the
title
barely
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
before
a
final
push
diverted
the
last
member
of
the
family
a
valued
uncle
into
the
sea
the
venue
in
this
case
being
whitby
presumably
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
but
all
this
had
happened
ten
years
ago
the
past
is
the
past
as
wordsworth
probably
said
to
coleridge
more
than
once
it
was
time
for
lord
blight
to
forget
these
incidents
of
his
eager
and
impetuous
youth
yet
somehow
he
could
not
within
the
last
few
days
his
conscience
had
begun
to
gnaw
him
and
in
his
despair
he
told
himself
that
at
last
the
day
of
reckoning
had
come
poor
blight
it
is
difficult
to
withhold
our
sympathy
from
him
the
door
opened
and
his
wife
the
countess
of
blight
came
into
the
library
blight
she
whispered
my
poor
blight
what
has
happened
he
looked
up
haggardly
gertie
he
said
for
that
was
her
name
it
is
all
over
my
sins
have
found
me
out
not
sins
she
said
gently
mistakes
mistakes
yes
you
are
right
he
stretched
out
a
hand
took
a
letter
from
the
desk
in
front
of
him
and
gave
it
to
her
read
that
with
a
groan
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
again
she
took
it
and
read
slowly
and
wonderingly
these
words
to
as
delivered
lord
blight
looked
up
with
an
impatient
ejaculation
give
it
to
me
he
said
in
some
annoyance
snatching
it
away
from
her
and
throwing
it
into
the
basket
here
this
is
the
one
read
it
read
it
quickly
for
we
must
decide
what
to
do
she
read
it
with
starting
eyes
dear
sir
i
am
prepared
to
lend
you
anything
from
to
on
your
alone
should
you
wish
d
n
said
the
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
here
where
is
the
blessed
thing
he
felt
in
his
pockets
i
must
have
i
only
had
it
a
ah
here
it
is
perhaps
i
had
better
read
it
to
you
this
time
he
put
on
his
spectacles
a
present
from
an
aunt
and
read
as
follows
my
lord
we
regret
to
inform
you
that
a
claimant
to
the
title
has
arisen
it
seems
that
soon
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
the
sixteenth
earl
of
blight
contracted
a
second
and
secret
marriage
to
ellen
podby
by
whom
he
had
eleven
sons
the
eldest
of
whom
is
now
asserting
his
right
to
the
earldom
and
estates
trusting
to
be
favoured
with
your
instructions
in
the
matter
we
are
my
lord
yours
faithfully
billings
billings
billings
gertie
countess
of
blight
looked
at
her
husband
in
horror
eleven
she
cried
eleven
said
the
earl
gloomily
then
a
look
of
grim
determination
came
into
his
eyes
with
the
air
of
one
who
might
have
been
quoting
keats
but
possibly
was
he
said
firmly
what
man
has
done
man
can
do
that
evening
the
countess
of
blight
gave
orders
for
eleven
spare
bedrooms
to
be
got
ready
ii
on
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
the
eleven
podbys
as
they
had
been
taught
to
call
themselves
john
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
spoke
quite
frankly
to
algernon
the
eldest
after
all
my
dear
algernon
he
said
we
are
cousins
there
is
no
need
for
harsh
words
between
us
all
i
ask
is
that
you
should
forbear
to
make
your
claim
until
i
have
delivered
my
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
on
the
coast
erosion
bill
upon
which
i
feel
deeply
once
the
bill
is
through
i
shall
be
prepared
to
retire
in
your
favour
meanwhile
let
us
all
enjoy
together
the
simple
pleasures
of
blight
hall
algernon
a
fair
young
man
with
a
meaningless
expression
replied
suitably
so
for
some
days
the
eleven
podbys
gave
themselves
up
to
pleasure
percy
the
youngest
though
hardly
of
an
age
to
appreciate
the
mechanism
of
it
was
allowed
to
push
the
lancelot
and
herbert
who
had
inherited
the
podby
intellect
were
encouraged
to
browse
around
the
revolving
bookcase
from
which
they
frequently
extracted
one
of
the
works
of
thackeray
replacing
it
again
after
a
glance
at
the
title
page
while
on
one
notable
occasion
the
earl
of
blight
took
algernon
into
the
at
about
in
the
morning
and
helped
him
to
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
slice
of
sultana
cake
in
this
way
the
days
passed
happily
and
confidence
between
the
eleven
podbys
and
their
cousin
was
established
it
was
on
a
fair
spring
morning
just
a
week
after
their
arrival
that
the
countess
of
blight
came
into
the
where
algernon
was
humming
a
tune
and
said
ah
algernon
my
husband
was
looking
for
you
i
think
he
has
some
little
excursion
to
propose
what
a
charming
day
is
it
not
you
will
find
him
in
the
library
as
algernon
entered
the
library
lord
blight
looked
up
from
the
map
he
was
studying
and
nodded
i
thought
he
said
coming
to
the
point
at
once
that
it
might
amuse
you
to
drive
over
with
me
to
flamborough
head
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
is
considered
well
worth
a
visit
i
do
know
if
your
tastes
lie
in
that
direction
at
all
algernon
was
delighted
at
the
idea
and
replied
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
pleasure
than
to
accompany
lord
blight
excellent
perhaps
we
had
better
take
some
sandwiches
and
make
a
day
of
it
greatly
elated
at
the
thought
of
a
day
by
the
sea
lord
blight
went
out
and
gave
instructions
to
the
countess
for
sandwiches
to
be
cut
in
two
packets
my
love
he
added
in
case
algernon
and
i
get
separated
half
an
hour
later
they
started
off
together
in
high
spirits
it
was
dark
before
the
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
returned
to
the
house
and
joined
the
others
at
the
his
face
wore
a
slightly
worried
expression
the
fact
is
my
dear
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
countess
i
am
a
little
upset
about
algernon
i
fear
we
have
lost
him
algernon
said
the
countess
in
surprise
yes
we
were
standing
at
the
top
of
flamborough
head
looking
down
into
the
sea
when
he
paused
and
tapped
his
glass
sherry
jenkins
he
said
catching
the
butler
eye
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
when
poor
algernon
stumbled
and
do
any
of
you
boys
know
if
your
brother
can
swim
everard
the
ninth
said
that
algernon
had
floated
once
in
the
paddington
baths
but
could
swim
ah
i
was
hoping
but
in
any
case
coming
into
the
water
from
that
height
well
well
we
must
face
our
troubles
bravely
another
glass
of
sherry
jenkins
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
on
their
way
to
the
lord
blight
stopped
a
moment
at
the
aneroid
barometer
and
gave
it
an
encouraging
tap
it
looks
like
another
fine
day
he
said
to
cuthbert
the
second
podby
the
panorama
from
the
scalby
cliffs
is
unrivalled
we
might
drive
over
and
have
a
look
at
it
iii
fortunately
the
weather
held
up
a
week
later
the
podby
family
had
been
thinned
down
to
five
and
the
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
was
beginning
to
regain
his
usual
equanimity
his
health
too
was
benefiting
by
the
constant
sea
air
and
change
for
in
order
that
no
melancholy
associations
should
cast
a
gloom
over
their
little
outings
he
took
care
to
visit
a
different
each
time
feeling
that
no
expense
or
trouble
should
be
spared
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
it
was
wonderful
with
what
vigour
and
alertness
of
mind
he
sat
down
in
the
evenings
to
the
preparation
of
his
speech
on
the
coast
erosion
bill
one
night
after
dinner
when
all
the
podby
family
basil
and
percy
had
retired
to
bed
gertie
countess
of
blight
came
into
her
library
and
twirling
the
revolving
bookcase
with
restless
fingers
asked
if
she
could
interrupt
him
for
a
moment
yes
he
said
looking
up
at
her
i
am
anxious
blight
she
answered
anxious
about
percy
so
am
i
my
love
he
responded
gravely
i
fear
that
he
consulted
a
leather
no
the
day
after
something
may
happen
to
him
i
have
an
uneasy
feeling
it
may
be
that
i
am
superstitious
yet
something
tells
me
that
in
the
book
of
fate
the
names
of
percy
and
bridlington
he
consulted
his
diary
again
yes
bridlington
the
names
as
i
was
saying
of
she
interrupted
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
you
misunderstand
me
she
said
that
is
not
why
i
am
anxious
i
am
anxious
because
of
something
i
have
just
learnt
about
percy
i
am
afraid
he
is
going
to
be
troublesome
suggested
lord
blight
she
nodded
i
have
learnt
she
explained
that
he
has
a
horror
of
high
places
you
mean
that
on
the
cliffs
of
as
it
might
be
bridlington
some
sudden
unbridled
terror
may
cause
him
to
hurl
himself
you
will
never
get
him
to
the
cliffs
of
bridlington
he
ca
even
look
out
of
a
window
he
wo
walk
up
the
gentlest
slope
that
is
why
he
is
always
playing
with
the
the
earl
frowned
and
tapped
on
his
desk
with
a
penholder
this
is
very
grave
news
gertie
he
said
how
is
it
that
the
boy
comes
to
have
this
unmanly
weakness
it
seems
he
has
always
had
it
he
should
have
been
taken
in
hand
even
now
perhaps
it
is
not
too
late
it
is
our
duty
to
wean
him
from
these
womanish
apprehensions
too
late
unless
you
carried
him
up
there
in
a
sack
no
no
protested
the
earl
vigorously
my
dear
the
seventeenth
earl
of
blight
carrying
a
sack
impossible
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
while
they
brooded
over
the
tragic
news
perhaps
said
the
countess
at
last
there
are
other
ways
it
may
be
that
percy
is
fond
of
fishing
lord
blight
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
seat
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
curiously
apologetic
air
i
am
afraid
my
dear
he
said
that
you
will
think
me
foolish
no
doubt
i
am
you
must
put
it
down
to
the
artistic
temperament
but
i
tell
you
quite
candidly
that
it
is
as
impossible
for
me
to
lose
percy
in
a
boating
accident
as
it
would
be
for
shall
i
say
sargent
to
appear
as
or
a
violinist
to
wish
to
exhibit
at
the
royal
academy
one
has
one
art
one
medium
of
expression
it
is
at
the
top
of
the
high
cliff
with
an
open
view
of
the
sea
that
i
express
myself
best
also
he
added
with
some
heat
i
feel
strongly
that
what
was
good
enough
for
father
ten
brothers
three
not
to
mention
his
cousin
should
be
good
enough
for
percy
the
countess
of
blight
moved
sadly
from
the
room
well
she
said
as
she
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
door
we
must
hope
for
the
best
perhaps
percy
will
overcome
this
aversion
in
time
you
might
talk
seriously
to
him
about
it
said
the
earl
referring
once
more
to
his
diary
basil
and
i
are
visiting
the
romantic
scarps
of
filey
iv
on
the
day
following
the
unfortunate
accident
at
filey
the
earl
and
countess
of
blight
reclined
together
upon
the
cliffs
of
bridlington
if
we
only
had
had
percy
here
sighed
the
earl
it
was
something
to
have
got
him
as
far
as
the
beach
said
the
countess
hopefully
perhaps
in
time
a
little
higher
every
day
the
earl
sighed
again
the
need
for
comes
strongly
upon
the
artist
at
a
time
like
this
he
said
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
that
i
have
genius
it
is
for
me
to
say
it
dear
said
his
wife
well
well
perhaps
in
my
own
line
and
at
the
full
height
of
powers
to
be
baulked
by
the
morbidity
for
i
can
call
it
nothing
else
of
a
percy
podby
gertie
he
went
on
dreamily
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
something
of
the
fascination
which
an
artist
finds
in
his
medium
to
be
lying
here
at
the
top
of
the
world
with
the
lazy
sea
crawling
beneath
us
so
many
feet
below
look
said
the
countess
suddenly
she
pointed
to
the
beach
the
earl
rose
stretched
his
head
over
the
edge
and
gazed
down
percy
he
said
yes
almost
exactly
beneath
us
if
anything
fell
upon
him
from
here
said
the
earl
thoughtfully
it
is
quite
possible
that
suddenly
the
fascination
whereof
he
had
spoken
to
her
came
irresistibly
home
to
the
countess
yes
she
said
as
if
in
a
trance
if
anything
fell
upon
him
from
here
and
she
gave
her
husband
a
thoughtful
push
it
is
quite
possible
that
at
the
word
that
the
earl
reached
percy
and
simultaneously
the
title
expired
poor
blight
or
perhaps
since
the
title
was
never
really
his
we
should
say
poor
blighter
it
is
difficult
to
withhold
our
sympathy
from
him
high
jinks
at
hall
inevitable
article
in
any
decent
magazine
at
read
it
carefully
and
then
have
an
uproarious
time
in
your
own
little
it
was
a
merry
party
assembled
at
hall
for
christmas
the
squire
liked
company
and
the
friends
whom
he
had
asked
down
for
the
festive
season
had
all
stayed
at
hall
before
and
were
therefore
well
acquainted
with
each
other
no
wonder
then
that
the
wit
flowed
fast
and
furious
and
that
the
guests
all
agreed
afterwards
that
they
had
never
spent
such
a
jolly
christmas
and
that
the
best
of
all
possible
hosts
was
squire
tregarthen
first
we
must
introduce
some
of
the
squire
guests
to
our
readers
the
reverend
arthur
manley
a
clever
young
clergyman
with
a
taste
for
gardening
was
talking
in
one
corner
to
miss
phipps
a
pretty
girl
of
some
twenty
summers
captain
bolsover
a
smart
cavalry
officer
together
with
professor
and
from
oxford
formed
a
small
party
in
another
corner
handsome
jack
ellison
was
as
usual
in
deep
conversation
with
the
beautiful
miss
holden
who
it
was
agreed
among
the
ladies
of
the
party
was
not
altogether
indifferent
to
his
fine
figure
and
remarkable
prospects
there
were
other
guests
but
as
they
chiefly
played
the
part
of
audience
in
the
events
which
followed
their
names
will
not
be
of
any
special
interest
to
our
readers
suffice
it
to
say
that
they
were
all
intelligent
and
ready
for
any
sort
of
fun
thank
heaven
we
can
a
burst
of
laughter
from
captain
bolsover
attracted
general
attention
and
everybody
turned
in
his
direction
by
jove
professor
that
good
he
said
as
he
slapped
his
knee
you
must
tell
the
others
that
it
was
just
a
little
incident
that
happened
to
me
as
i
was
coming
down
here
said
the
professor
as
he
beamed
round
on
the
company
i
happened
to
be
rather
late
for
my
train
and
as
i
bought
my
ticket
i
asked
the
clerk
what
time
it
was
he
replied
it
takes
six
seconds
for
a
clock
to
strike
six
how
long
will
it
take
to
strike
twelve
i
said
twelve
seconds
but
it
seems
i
was
wrong
the
others
all
said
twelve
seconds
too
but
they
were
all
wrong
can
guess
the
right
answer
when
the
laughter
had
died
down
the
reverend
arthur
manley
said
that
reminds
me
of
an
amusing
experience
which
occurred
to
my
housekeeper
last
friday
she
was
ordering
a
little
fish
for
my
lunch
and
the
fishmonger
when
asked
the
price
of
herrings
replied
for
one
and
a
half
to
which
my
housekeeper
said
i
will
have
twelve
how
much
did
she
pay
he
smiled
happily
at
the
company
one
and
sixpence
of
course
said
miss
phipps
no
no
ninepence
cried
the
squire
with
a
hearty
laugh
captain
bolsover
made
it
come
to
and
the
professor
thought
fourpence
but
once
again
they
were
all
wrong
what
do
make
it
come
to
it
was
now
captain
bolsover
turn
for
an
amusing
puzzle
and
the
others
turned
eagerly
towards
him
what
was
that
one
about
a
door
said
the
squire
you
were
telling
me
when
we
were
out
shooting
yesterday
bolsover
captain
bolsover
looked
surprised
ah
no
it
was
young
reggie
worlock
said
the
squire
with
a
hearty
laugh
oh
do
tell
us
squire
said
everybody
it
was
just
a
little
riddle
my
dear
said
the
squire
to
miss
phipps
always
a
favourite
of
his
when
is
a
door
not
a
door
miss
phipps
said
when
it
was
a
cucumber
but
she
was
wrong
so
were
the
others
see
if
can
be
more
successful
yes
that
very
good
said
captain
bolsover
it
reminds
me
of
something
which
occurred
during
the
boer
war
everybody
listened
eagerly
we
were
just
going
into
action
and
i
happened
to
turn
round
to
my
men
and
say
then
boys
give
beans
to
my
amusement
one
of
them
replied
smartly
many
blue
beans
make
five
we
were
all
so
interested
in
working
it
out
that
we
never
got
into
action
at
all
but
that
easy
said
the
professor
five
four
said
miss
phipps
she
would
silly
kid
six
said
the
squire
which
was
right
jack
ellison
had
been
silent
during
the
laughter
and
jollity
always
such
a
feature
of
hall
at
but
now
he
contributed
an
ingenious
puzzle
to
the
amusement
of
the
company
i
met
a
man
in
a
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
who
told
me
that
he
had
four
sons
the
eldest
son
abraham
had
a
dog
who
used
to
go
and
visit
the
three
brothers
occasionally
the
dog
my
informant
told
me
was
very
unwilling
to
go
over
the
same
ground
twice
and
yet
being
in
a
hurry
wished
to
take
the
shortest
journey
possible
how
did
he
manage
it
for
a
little
while
the
company
was
puzzled
then
after
deep
thought
the
professor
said
it
depends
on
where
they
lived
yes
said
ellison
i
forgot
to
say
that
my
acquaintance
drew
me
a
map
he
produced
a
paper
from
his
pocket
here
it
is
the
others
immediately
began
to
puzzle
over
the
answer
miss
phipps
being
unusually
foolish
even
for
her
it
was
some
time
before
they
discovered
the
correct
route
what
do
think
it
is
well
said
the
squire
with
a
hearty
laugh
it
time
for
bed
one
by
one
they
filed
off
saying
what
a
delightful
evening
they
had
had
jack
ellison
was
particularly
emphatic
for
the
beautiful
miss
holden
had
promised
to
be
his
wife
he
for
one
will
never
forget
christmas
at
hall
the
arrival
of
blackman
warbler
i
am
become
an
authority
on
birds
it
happened
in
this
way
the
other
day
we
heard
the
cuckoo
in
hampshire
the
next
morning
the
papers
announced
that
the
cuckoo
had
been
heard
in
devonshire
possibly
a
different
one
but
in
no
way
superior
to
ours
except
in
the
matter
of
its
press
agent
well
everybody
in
the
house
said
did
you
hear
the
cuckoo
to
everybody
else
until
i
began
to
get
rather
tired
of
it
and
having
told
everybody
several
times
that
i
heard
it
i
tried
to
make
the
conversation
more
interesting
so
after
my
tenth
yes
i
added
quite
casually
but
i
have
heard
the
tufted
pipit
yet
it
funny
why
it
should
be
so
late
this
year
is
that
the
same
as
the
tree
pipit
said
my
hostess
who
seemed
to
know
more
about
birds
than
i
had
hoped
oh
no
i
said
quickly
what
the
difference
exactly
well
one
is
tufted
i
said
doing
my
best
and
the
other
er
climbs
trees
oh
i
see
and
of
course
the
eggs
are
more
speckled
i
added
gradually
acquiring
confidence
i
often
wish
i
knew
more
about
birds
she
said
regretfully
you
must
tell
us
something
about
them
now
we
got
you
here
and
all
this
because
of
one
miserable
cuckoo
by
all
means
i
said
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
book
about
birds
down
from
london
however
it
was
easier
than
i
thought
we
had
tea
in
the
garden
that
afternoon
and
a
bird
of
some
kind
struck
up
in
the
there
now
said
my
hostess
what
that
i
listened
with
my
head
on
one
side
the
bird
said
it
again
that
the
lesser
bunting
i
said
hopefully
the
lesser
bunting
said
an
girl
i
shall
always
remember
that
i
hoped
she
would
but
i
could
hardly
say
so
fortunately
the
bird
again
and
i
seized
the
opportunity
of
playing
for
safety
or
is
it
the
sardinian
i
wondered
they
have
very
much
the
same
note
during
the
breeding
season
but
of
course
the
eggs
are
more
speckled
i
added
casually
and
so
on
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
you
see
how
easy
it
is
however
the
next
afternoon
a
more
unfortunate
occurrence
occurred
a
real
bird
authority
came
to
tea
as
soon
as
the
information
leaked
out
i
sent
up
a
hasty
prayer
for
until
we
had
got
him
safely
out
of
the
place
but
it
was
not
granted
our
feathered
songster
in
the
broke
into
his
little
piece
there
said
my
hostess
there
that
bird
again
she
turned
to
me
what
did
you
say
it
was
i
hoped
that
the
authority
would
speak
first
and
that
the
others
would
then
accept
my
assurance
that
they
had
misunderstood
me
the
day
before
but
he
was
entangled
at
that
moment
in
a
watercress
sandwich
the
loose
ends
of
which
were
still
waiting
to
be
tucked
away
i
looked
anxiously
at
the
girl
who
had
promised
to
remember
in
case
she
wanted
to
say
something
but
she
also
was
silent
everybody
was
silent
except
that
miserable
bird
well
i
had
to
have
another
go
at
it
blackman
warbler
i
said
firmly
oh
yes
said
my
hostess
blackman
warbler
i
shall
always
remember
that
lied
the
girl
the
authority
who
was
free
by
this
time
looked
at
me
indignantly
nonsense
he
said
it
the
everybody
else
looked
at
me
reproachfully
i
was
about
to
say
that
blackman
warbler
was
the
local
name
for
the
in
our
part
of
somerset
when
the
authority
spoke
again
the
he
said
to
our
hostess
with
an
insufferable
air
of
knowledge
i
was
going
to
stand
that
so
thought
when
i
heard
it
first
i
said
giving
him
a
gentle
smile
it
was
now
the
authority
turn
to
get
the
reproachful
looks
are
they
very
much
alike
my
hostess
asked
me
much
impressed
very
much
blackmail
warbler
is
often
mistaken
for
the
even
by
experts
and
i
turned
to
the
authority
and
added
have
another
sandwich
wo
you
particularly
so
of
course
during
the
breeding
season
it
is
true
that
the
eggs
are
more
speckled
but
bless
my
soul
said
the
authority
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
shaken
i
should
think
i
know
a
when
i
hear
one
ah
but
do
you
know
a
blackman
warbler
one
does
often
hear
them
in
this
country
now
in
algiers
the
bird
said
again
with
an
almost
indecent
plainness
of
speech
there
you
are
i
said
triumphantly
listen
and
i
held
up
a
finger
you
notice
the
difference
a
blackman
warbler
everybody
looked
at
the
authority
he
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
book
about
birds
down
from
london
and
deciding
that
it
could
be
done
that
afternoon
meanwhile
he
did
not
dare
to
repudiate
me
for
all
he
had
caught
of
our
mumbled
introduction
i
might
have
been
blackman
myself
possibly
you
right
he
said
reluctantly
another
bird
said
from
another
tree
and
i
thought
it
wise
to
be
generous
there
i
said
now
that
a
the
girl
remarked
silly
creature
that
it
sounded
just
like
the
other
one
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
her
they
were
all
busy
admiring
me
of
course
i
must
meet
the
authority
again
because
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
when
he
got
back
to
his
books
he
looked
up
blackman
warbler
and
found
that
there
was
no
such
animal
but
if
you
mix
in
the
right
society
and
only
see
the
wrong
people
once
it
is
really
quite
easy
to
be
an
authority
on
birds
or
i
imagine
on
anything
else
the
last
straw
it
was
one
of
those
summer
evenings
with
the
chill
on
so
after
dinner
we
lit
the
fire
and
wondered
what
to
do
there
were
eight
of
us
just
the
right
number
for
two
bridge
tables
or
four
picquet
pairs
or
eight
patience
singles
oh
no
not
cards
said
celia
quickly
they
so
dull
not
when
you
get
a
grand
slam
said
our
host
thinking
of
an
accident
which
had
happened
to
him
the
night
before
even
then
i
do
suppose
anybody
laughed
peter
and
i
who
were
partners
on
that
occasion
admitted
that
we
laughed
well
there
you
are
said
celia
triumphantly
let
play
proverbs
i
do
think
i
know
it
said
herbert
he
would
oh
it
quite
easy
first
you
think
of
a
proverb
like
burnt
camel
spoils
the
moss
i
explained
you
mean
burnt
child
dreads
the
fire
corrected
herbert
celia
caught
my
eye
and
went
on
hurriedly
well
then
somebody
goes
outside
and
then
he
asks
questions
from
outside
asked
herbert
from
inside
i
assured
her
generally
from
very
near
the
fire
because
he
has
got
so
cold
waiting
in
the
hall
oh
yes
i
see
and
then
he
asks
questions
and
we
each
have
to
get
one
of
the
words
of
the
proverb
into
our
answer
without
letting
him
know
what
the
proverb
is
it
rather
fun
peter
and
his
wife
who
knew
the
game
agreed
herbert
seemed
resigned
to
the
worst
but
herbert
though
faint
was
still
pursuing
but
does
he
what
the
proverb
is
he
asked
sometimes
i
admitted
but
sometimes
if
we
are
very
very
clever
he
does
that
in
fact
is
the
game
our
host
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
i
think
i
see
he
said
and
i
want
my
pipe
anyhow
so
i
go
out
first
now
then
said
celia
when
the
door
was
safely
closed
what
shall
we
have
of
course
you
know
this
game
and
you
know
the
difficulty
of
thinking
of
a
proverb
which
has
no
moss
or
or
glasshouses
in
it
all
of
them
words
which
it
is
impossible
to
include
naturally
in
an
answer
to
an
ordinary
question
the
proverbs
which
herbert
suggested
were
full
of
moss
what
about
never
too
late
to
mend
said
peter
the
only
difficult
word
is
we
must
have
less
than
seven
words
one
for
each
of
us
ca
we
get
something
from
solomon
for
a
change
said
peter
roaring
lion
is
a
calamity
to
its
father
but
the
cautious
man
cometh
not
again
that
sort
of
thing
we
might
try
it
said
celia
doubtfully
not
feeling
quite
sure
if
it
were
a
real
proverb
but
would
be
difficult
i
do
see
why
said
herbert
one
could
always
work
it
in
somehow
well
of
course
if
he
asked
you
what
train
cometh
thou
up
in
the
mornings
you
could
answer
cometh
up
by
the
only
you
do
get
that
sort
of
question
as
a
rule
oh
i
see
said
herbert
i
did
quite
understand
after
all
its
really
much
more
fun
having
camels
and
things
said
celia
the
last
straw
that
breaks
the
camel
back
who
do
you
better
she
added
kindly
to
me
everybody
but
myself
seemed
to
think
that
this
was
much
more
fun
i
do
said
peter
generously
whereupon
celia
volunteered
for
breaks
there
were
seven
of
us
for
nine
words
we
gave
herbert
the
second
the
fearing
to
trust
her
with
anything
more
alarming
and
in
order
to
keep
it
in
the
family
we
gave
the
other
the
to
herbert
who
was
also
responsible
for
back
our
hostess
had
last
and
peter
had
that
all
this
being
settled
our
host
was
admitted
into
his
again
you
begin
with
me
i
said
and
i
was
promptly
asked
how
many
blue
beans
make
five
when
i
had
made
a
suitable
answer
into
which
it
came
without
much
difficulty
our
host
turned
to
herbert
herbert
face
had
already
assumed
a
look
of
strained
expectancy
well
herbert
what
do
you
think
of
lloyd
george
yes
said
herbert
yes
er
yes
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
he
er
that
is
to
say
er
lloyd
george
yes
is
that
the
answer
said
our
host
rather
surprised
herbert
explained
hastily
that
he
had
really
begun
yet
and
with
the
aid
of
an
anecdote
about
a
cousin
of
his
who
had
met
winston
churchill
at
dieppe
once
he
managed
to
get
the
in
several
times
before
blowing
his
nose
vigorously
and
announcing
that
he
had
finished
i
believe
he
playing
a
different
game
murmured
celia
to
peter
the
next
three
words
were
disposed
of
easily
enough
a
lucky
question
to
peter
about
the
weather
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
refer
to
his
straw
hat
it
was
now
celia
turn
for
breaks
nervous
i
asked
her
all
of
a
twitter
she
said
well
celia
said
our
host
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
with
us
oh
a
long
time
yet
said
celia
confidently
till
wednesday
anyhow
i
interrupted
thinking
it
a
good
opportunity
to
clinch
the
matter
we
generally
stay
explained
celia
until
our
host
breaks
it
to
us
that
he
ca
stick
us
any
longer
not
that
that
often
happens
i
added
look
here
which
of
you
is
answering
the
question
i
am
said
celia
firmly
well
have
you
answered
it
yet
to
tell
the
truth
i
quite
forgotten
the
word
that
oh
i
remember
now
yes
she
went
on
very
distinctly
and
slowly
i
hope
to
remain
under
your
roof
until
next
wednesday
morn
whew
and
she
fanned
herself
with
her
handkerchief
herbert
repeated
her
husband
triumph
with
the
and
then
it
was
my
turn
again
for
these
horrible
camels
my
only
hope
was
that
our
host
would
ask
me
if
i
had
been
to
the
zoo
lately
but
i
did
see
why
he
should
he
did
would
it
surprise
you
to
hear
he
asked
that
the
president
of
has
a
very
long
beard
if
it
had
only
been
i
murmured
to
myself
aloud
i
said
what
in
the
hope
of
gaining
a
little
more
time
he
repeated
his
question
no
i
said
slowly
no
it
would
and
i
telegraphed
an
appeal
to
celia
for
help
she
nodded
back
at
me
have
you
finished
asked
our
host
good
lord
no
i
shall
be
half
an
hour
yet
the
fact
is
you
asked
the
wrong
question
you
see
i
got
to
get
in
i
thought
it
was
said
celia
carelessly
no
now
if
you
only
asked
me
a
question
about
gardening
you
see
the
proverb
we
wanted
to
have
first
of
all
was
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
throw
stones
only
was
so
difficult
almost
as
difficult
as
i
turned
to
celia
what
was
it
you
said
just
now
oh
yes
camels
or
stable
doors
or
however
there
it
is
and
i
enlarged
a
little
more
on
the
difficulty
of
getting
in
these
difficult
words
thank
you
very
much
said
our
host
faintly
when
i
had
finished
it
was
the
last
straw
which
broke
the
camel
back
and
it
was
herbert
who
stepped
forward
blithely
with
the
last
straw
our
host
as
he
admitted
afterwards
was
still
quite
in
the
dark
and
with
his
last
question
he
presented
herbert
with
an
absolute
gift
when
do
you
go
back
to
devonshire
he
asked
we
er
return
next
month
answered
herbert
i
should
say
he
added
hastily
we
go
next
month
my
own
private
opinion
was
that
the
sooner
he
returned
to
devonshire
the
better
disillusioned
the
card
was
just
an
ordinary
card
the
letter
just
an
ordinary
letter
the
letter
simply
said
dear
brown
i
asked
by
phipp
to
send
you
this
the
card
said
philby
phipp
at
home
and
in
a
corner
dancing
no
more
except
a
date
a
hint
in
french
that
a
reply
would
not
be
deemed
offensive
and
most
important
phipp
address
destiny
as
the
poets
have
observed
or
will
do
shortly
is
a
mighty
thing
it
takes
us
by
the
ear
and
lugs
us
firmly
down
different
paths
towards
one
common
goal
paths
not
of
our
own
choosing
or
sometimes
throws
two
travellers
together
marches
them
side
by
side
for
half
a
mile
then
snatches
them
apart
and
hauls
them
onward
thus
happened
it
that
phipp
and
i
had
never
met
to
any
great
extent
had
never
met
as
far
as
i
remembered
at
all
and
yet
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
she
and
i
were
very
near
together
when
some
one
told
her
is
brown
or
introduced
us
is
brown
or
asked
her
if
she
heard
of
brown
i
know
not
what
i
only
know
that
now
she
stood
at
home
in
need
of
brown
and
i
had
pledged
myself
to
her
assistance
behold
me
on
the
night
the
latest
word
in
all
that
separates
the
gentleman
and
waiters
from
the
mob
and
graced
moreover
by
the
latest
word
in
waistcoats
such
as
mark
one
from
the
waiters
my
shirt
i
must
not
speak
about
my
shirt
my
tie
i
can
not
dwell
upon
my
tie
enough
that
all
was
neat
harmonious
and
suitable
to
philby
phipp
behold
me
then
complete
a
hasty
search
to
find
the
card
and
reassure
myself
that
this
is
certainly
the
day
it
is
and
the
hour
not
not
after
breakfast
good
and
then
outside
to
jump
into
a
cab
and
take
the
winds
the
cold
east
winds
of
march
with
beauty
so
let
us
get
on
more
quickly
looms
ahead
tragedy
let
us
on
and
have
it
over
i
hung
with
men
and
women
on
the
stairs
and
watched
the
tall
white
footman
take
the
names
and
heard
him
shout
them
out
and
there
i
shaped
my
own
name
ready
for
him
mr
brown
and
philby
phipp
hearing
the
name
would
i
imagined
brighten
suddenly
and
smile
and
say
how
you
mr
brown
and
in
an
instant
i
remember
her
and
where
we
met
and
who
was
phipp
and
all
the
jolly
time
at
grindelwald
if
that
was
where
it
was
and
she
and
i
would
talk
of
art
and
politics
and
things
as
we
had
talked
these
many
years
ago
so
brown
i
murmured
to
the
man
and
he
the
fool
he
took
a
mighty
breath
and
shouted
mr
brownie
brownie
yes
he
shouted
brownie
to
the
roof
and
philby
phipp
hearing
the
name
brightened
up
suddenly
and
smiled
and
said
how
you
mr
brownie
brownie
lord
and
while
my
mouth
was
open
to
protest
do
you
do
to
some
one
at
the
back
so
i
was
passed
along
into
the
crowd
as
brownie
who
on
earth
is
brownie
did
he
i
wonder
he
and
phipp
talk
art
and
politics
at
grindelwald
or
did
one
simply
point
him
out
to
her
with
is
mr
brownie
were
they
friends
dear
friends
or
casual
acquaintances
she
brightened
at
his
name
some
memory
came
back
to
her
that
brought
a
happy
smile
why
surely
they
were
friends
but
am
brown
a
stranger
all
unknown
to
phipp
as
she
to
me
a
common
interloper
i
see
it
now
an
uninvited
guest
whose
card
was
clearly
meant
for
brownie
soft
music
fell
and
the
kaleidoscope
of
lovely
woman
glided
swayed
and
turned
beneath
the
shaded
lights
but
brownie
brown
not
brownie
stood
upon
one
side
and
brooded
silently
some
spoke
to
him
whether
to
brown
or
brownie
mattered
not
he
did
not
answer
did
not
notice
them
just
stood
and
brooded
then
went
home
to
bed
a
few
tricks
for
christmas
the
manner
of
many
now
that
the
festive
season
is
approaching
it
behoves
us
all
to
prepare
ourselves
in
some
way
to
contribute
to
the
gaiety
of
the
christmas
a
clever
conjurer
is
welcome
anywhere
and
those
of
us
whose
powers
of
entertainment
are
limited
to
the
setting
of
or
the
arranging
of
beds
must
view
with
envy
the
much
greater
tribute
of
laughter
and
applause
which
is
the
lot
of
the
prestidigitator
with
some
natural
gift
for
legerdemain
fortunately
there
are
a
few
simple
conjuring
tricks
which
are
within
the
reach
of
us
all
with
practice
even
the
clumsiest
of
us
can
obtain
sufficient
dexterity
in
the
art
of
illusion
to
puzzle
the
most
observant
of
our
the
few
simple
tricks
which
i
am
about
to
explain
if
studied
diligently
for
a
few
days
before
christmas
will
make
a
genuine
addition
to
the
gaiety
of
any
gathering
and
the
amateur
prestidigitator
if
i
may
use
that
word
again
will
find
that
he
is
amply
repaying
the
hospitality
of
his
host
and
hostess
by
his
contribution
to
the
general
festivity
so
much
by
way
of
introduction
it
is
a
difficult
style
of
writing
to
keep
up
particularly
when
the
number
of
synonyms
for
conjuring
is
so
strictly
limited
let
me
now
get
to
the
tricks
i
call
the
first
holding
the
lemon
for
this
trick
you
want
a
lemon
and
a
pack
of
ordinary
cutting
the
lemon
in
two
you
hand
half
to
one
member
of
your
audience
and
half
to
another
asking
them
to
hold
the
halves
up
in
full
view
of
the
company
then
taking
the
pack
of
cards
in
your
own
hands
you
offer
it
to
a
third
member
of
the
party
requesting
him
to
select
a
card
and
examine
it
carefully
when
he
has
done
this
he
puts
it
back
in
the
pack
and
you
seize
this
opportunity
to
look
hurriedly
at
the
face
of
it
discovering
let
us
say
that
it
is
the
five
of
spades
once
more
you
shuffle
the
pack
and
then
going
through
the
cards
one
by
one
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
locating
the
five
of
spades
which
you
will
hold
up
to
the
company
with
the
words
i
think
this
is
your
card
sir
whereupon
the
audience
will
testify
by
its
surprise
and
appreciation
that
you
have
guessed
correctly
it
will
be
noticed
that
strictly
speaking
the
lemon
is
not
a
necessary
adjunct
of
this
trick
but
the
employment
of
it
certainly
adds
an
air
of
mystery
to
the
initial
stages
of
the
illusion
and
this
air
of
mystery
is
after
all
the
chief
of
the
successful
conjurer
for
my
next
trick
which
i
call
the
illusory
egg
and
which
is
most
complicated
you
require
a
sponge
two
tablecloths
a
handful
of
nuts
a
rabbit
five
yards
of
coloured
ribbon
a
with
a
hole
in
it
a
egg
two
florins
and
a
gentleman
watch
having
obtained
all
these
things
which
may
take
some
time
you
put
the
two
tablecloths
aside
and
separate
the
other
articles
into
two
heaps
the
rabbit
the
the
egg
and
the
handful
of
nuts
being
in
one
heap
and
the
ribbon
the
sponge
the
gentleman
watch
and
the
two
florins
in
the
other
this
being
done
you
cover
each
heap
with
a
tablecloth
so
that
none
of
the
objects
beneath
is
in
any
way
visible
then
you
invite
any
gentleman
in
the
audience
to
think
of
a
number
let
us
suppose
he
thinks
of
in
that
case
you
ask
any
lady
in
the
audience
to
think
of
an
odd
number
and
she
suggests
shall
we
say
then
asking
the
company
to
watch
you
carefully
you
you
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
forgotten
just
what
it
is
you
do
but
i
know
that
it
is
a
very
good
trick
and
never
fails
to
create
laughter
and
bewilderment
it
is
distinctly
an
illusion
worth
trying
and
if
you
begin
it
in
the
manner
i
have
described
quite
possibly
some
way
of
finishing
it
up
will
occur
to
you
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
multiplying
the
two
numbers
together
and
passing
the
egg
through
the
sponge
and
then
taking
the
or
is
it
the
anyway
i
certain
you
have
to
have
a
piece
of
elastic
up
the
sleeve
and
i
know
one
of
the
florins
has
to
no
it
no
good
i
ca
remember
it
but
mention
of
the
two
numbers
reminds
me
of
a
trick
which
i
forgotten
it
is
a
illusion
and
always
creates
the
of
wonderment
amongst
the
audience
it
is
called
the
three
questions
as
before
you
ask
a
gentleman
in
the
company
to
write
down
a
number
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
lady
to
write
down
another
number
these
numbers
they
show
to
the
other
guests
you
then
inform
the
company
that
you
will
ask
any
one
of
them
three
questions
and
by
the
way
they
are
answered
you
will
guess
what
the
product
of
the
two
numbers
is
for
instance
if
the
numbers
were
and
then
multiplied
by
is
let
see
thirteen
sevens
are
thirteen
sevens
seven
threes
are
seven
times
one
is
well
look
here
let
suppose
the
numbers
are
and
then
the
product
is
and
is
the
number
you
have
got
to
guess
well
the
company
selects
a
lady
to
answer
your
questions
and
the
first
thing
you
ask
her
is
when
was
magna
charta
signed
probably
she
says
that
she
does
know
then
you
say
what
is
the
capital
of
persia
she
answers
timbuctoo
or
omar
khayyam
according
to
how
well
informed
she
is
then
comes
your
last
question
what
makes
lightning
she
is
practically
certain
to
say
oh
the
thunder
then
you
tell
her
that
the
two
numbers
multiplied
together
come
to
how
is
this
remarkable
trick
performed
it
is
quite
simple
the
two
people
whom
you
asked
to
think
of
the
numbers
are
confederates
and
you
arranged
with
them
beforehand
that
they
should
write
down
and
of
course
it
would
be
a
much
better
trick
if
they
were
confederates
but
in
that
case
i
do
quite
know
how
you
would
do
it
i
shall
end
up
this
interesting
and
instructive
article
with
a
rather
more
difficult
illusion
for
the
tricks
i
have
already
explained
it
was
sufficient
that
the
amateur
prestidigitator
i
shall
only
say
this
once
more
should
know
how
it
was
done
for
my
last
trick
he
will
also
require
a
certain
aptitude
for
legerdemain
in
order
to
do
it
but
a
week
quiet
practice
at
home
will
give
him
all
the
skill
that
is
necessary
the
mysterious
pudding
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
popular
illusions
you
begin
by
borrowing
a
gold
watch
from
one
of
your
audience
having
removed
the
works
you
wrap
the
empty
case
up
in
a
handkerchief
and
hand
it
back
to
him
asking
him
to
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
the
works
you
place
in
an
ordinary
pudding
basin
and
proceed
to
pound
up
with
a
hammer
having
reduced
them
to
powder
you
cover
the
basin
with
another
handkerchief
which
you
borrow
from
a
member
of
the
company
and
announce
that
you
are
about
to
make
a
cutting
a
small
hole
in
the
top
of
the
handkerchief
you
drop
a
lighted
match
through
the
aperture
whereupon
the
handkerchief
flares
up
when
the
flames
have
died
down
you
exhibit
the
basin
wherein
to
the
surprise
of
all
is
to
be
seen
an
excellent
christmas
pudding
which
you
may
ask
your
audience
to
sample
at
the
same
time
you
tell
the
owner
of
the
watch
that
if
he
feels
in
his
pockets
he
will
find
his
property
restored
to
him
intact
and
to
his
amazement
he
discovers
that
the
works
in
some
mysterious
way
have
got
back
into
his
watch
and
that
the
handkerchief
in
which
it
was
wrapped
up
has
gone
now
for
the
explanation
of
this
ingenious
illusion
the
secret
of
it
is
that
you
have
a
second
basin
with
a
pudding
in
it
concealed
in
the
palm
of
your
right
hand
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
handkerchief
flares
up
you
take
advantage
of
the
excitement
produced
to
substitute
the
one
basin
for
the
other
the
watch
from
which
you
extract
the
works
is
not
the
borrowed
one
but
one
which
you
have
had
concealed
between
the
third
and
fourth
fingers
of
the
left
hand
you
show
the
empty
case
of
this
watch
to
the
company
before
wrapping
the
watch
in
the
handkerchief
and
handing
it
back
to
its
owner
meanwhile
with
the
aid
of
a
little
wax
you
have
attached
an
invisible
hair
to
the
handkerchief
the
other
end
of
it
being
fastened
to
the
palm
of
your
left
hand
with
a
little
practice
it
is
not
difficult
to
withdraw
the
handkerchief
by
a
series
of
trifling
jerks
from
the
pocket
of
your
to
its
resting
place
between
the
first
and
second
finger
of
your
left
hand
one
word
more
i
am
afraid
that
the
borrowed
handkerchief
to
which
you
applied
the
match
really
did
get
burnt
and
you
will
probably
have
to
offer
the
owner
one
of
your
own
instead
that
is
the
only
weak
spot
in
one
of
the
most
baffling
tricks
ever
practised
by
the
amateur
prestidigitator
to
use
the
word
for
the
last
time
it
will
make
a
fitting
climax
to
your
evening
entertainment
an
entertainment
which
will
ensure
you
another
warm
invitation
next
year
when
the
festive
season
comes

us

again

manager
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
pick
up
for
a
mere
song
or
to
be
more
accurate
for
a
few
notes
several
thousand
miles
of
discarded
cinema

up
in
your
safe
no
one
need
ever
know
that
you
were
married
in
cornwall
years
ago
without
a
moment
hesitation
bellingham
took
a
handful
of
bank
notes
from
his
pocketbook
and
the
exchange
was
made
at
all
costs
he
must
preserve
his
little
hyacinth
from
shame
now
she
need
never
know
with
a
forced
smile
he
bowed
jasper
out
placed
the
packet
in
his
safe
and
returned
to
his
desk
but
his
mysterious
visitor
was
not
done
with
yet
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
jasper
softly
drugged
andrew
hastily
and
took
possession
again
of
the
compromising
documents
by
the
time
bellingham
had
regained
his
senses
the
thief
was
away
a
was
raised
police
whistles
were
blown
and
richard
harrington
bellingham
private
secretary
was
smartly
arrested
at
the
trial
things
looked
black
against
richard
he
was
poor
and
he
was
in
love
with
hyacinth
the
chain
of
evidence
was
complete
in
spite
of
his
impassioned
protest
from
the
dock
in
spite
of
hyacinth
dramatic
swoon
in
front
of
the
solicitor
table
the
judge
with
great
solemnity
passed
sentence
of
twenty
years
penal
servitude
a
loud
hear
hear
from
the
gallery
rang
through
the
court
and
looking
up
bellingham
caught
the
sardonic
eye
of
the
mysterious
jasper
ii
richard
had
been
in
prison
a
month
before
the
opportunity
for
his
escape
occurred
for
a
month
he
had
been
hewing
stone
in
portland
black
despair
at
his
heart
then
like
lightning
he
saw
his
chance
and
took
it
the
warders
were
off
guard
for
a
moment
hastily
lifting
his
pickaxe
manager
but
it
a
spade
in
the
only
prison
film
we
hastily
borrowing
a
spade
from
a
comrade
who
was
digging
potatoes
he
struck
several
of
his
gaolers
down
and
dodging
the
shots
of
others
who
hurried
to
the
scene
he
climbed
the
prison
wall
and
dashed
for
freedom
reaching
weymouth
at
nightfall
he
made
his
way
to
the
house
which
hyacinth
had
taken
in
order
to
be
near
him
and
suitably
disguised
travelled
up
to
london
with
her
in
the
powerful
motor
which
she
had
kept
ready
at
last
my
love
we
are
together
he
murmured
as
they
neared
wimbledon
but
he
had
spoken
a
moment
too
soon
an
aeroplane
swooped
down
upon
them
and
hyacinth
was
snatched
from
his
arms
and
disappeared
with
her
captors
into
the
clouds
iii
richard
first
act
on
arriving
in
london
was
to
go
to
house
andrew
was
out
but
a
note
lying
on
his
study
carpet
me
at
the
old
windmill
gave
him
a
clue
on
receipt
of
this
note
andrew
had
gone
to
the
rendezvous
and
it
was
no
surprise
to
him
when
jasper
stepped
out
and
offered
to
sell
him
a
packet
containing
a
marriage
certificate
a
photograph
of
an
old
gentleman
dipping
a
sheep
a
peppermint
lozenge
with
jess
on
it
and
various
other
documents
for
a
thousand
pounds
you
villain
cried
andrew
even
at
the
trial
i
suspected
you
and
he
rushed
at
him
fiercely
a
desperate
struggle
ensued
breaking
free
for
a
moment
from
the
grip
of
the
other
jasper
leapt
with
the
spring
of
a
panther
at
one
of
the
sails
of
the
windmill
as
it
came
round
and
was
whirled
upwards
with
the
spring
of
another
panther
andrew
leapt
on
to
the
next
sail
and
was
whirled
after
him
at
that
moment
the
wind
dropped
and
the
combatants
were
suspended
in
it
was
upon
this
terrible
scene
that
richard
arrived
already
a
crowd
was
collecting
and
though
at
present
it
did
not
seem
greatly
alarmed
feeling
convinced
that
it
was
only
assisting
at
another
cinematograph
rehearsal
its
suspicions
might
at
any
moment
be
aroused
with
a
shout
he
dashed
into
the
mill
seeing
him
coming
jasper
dropped
his
revolver
and
slid
down
the
sail
into
the
window
in
a
moment
he
reappeared
at
the
door
of
the
mill
with
hyacinth
under
his
arm
stop
him
cried
richard
from
underneath
a
sack
of
flour
it
was
no
good
jasper
had
leapt
with
his
fair
burden
upon
the
back
of
his
mustang
and
was
gone
the
usual
pursuit
followed
iv
it
was
the
gala
night
at
the
royal
circus
ricardo
harringtoni
the
wonderful
new
acrobat
of
whom
everybody
was
talking
stood
high
above
the
crowd
on
his
platform
his
marvellous
performance
on
the
swinging
horizontal
bar
was
about
to
begin
richard
harrington
for
it
was
he
was
troubled
since
he
had
entered
on
his
new
profession
as
a
disguise
from
the
police
who
were
still
searching
for
him
he
had
had
a
vague
suspicion
that
the
was
dogging
him
was
the
could
it
be
jasper
at
that
moment
the
band
struck
up
and
richard
leapt
lightly
on
to
the
swinging
bar
with
a
movement
full
of
grace
he
let
go
of
the
bar
and
swung
on
to
the
opposite
platform
and
then
even
as
he
was
in
he
realized
what
was
happening
jasper
had
let
the
lion
loose
was
waiting
for
with
a
gasping
cry
ricardo
harringtoni
fainted
v
when
he
recovered
consciousness
richard
found
himself
on
the
boracic
which
was
forging
her
way
through
the
manager
where
there
are
the
indian
ocean
bellingham
was
bathing
his
forehead
with
cooling
drinks
forgive
me
my
boy
said
bellingham
for
the
wrong

did

was
jasper
who
stole
the
compromising
documents

refuses
to
give
them
back
unless

richard

away

one

and
she
is
yours
at
that
moment
a
terrible
cry
rang
through
the
ship
man
overboard
pushing
over
bellingham
and
running
on
deck
richard
saw
that
a
woman
and
her
baby
were
battling
for
life
in
the
waters
in
an
instant
he
had
plunged
in
and
rescued
them
as
they
were
dragged
together
up
the
ship
side
he
heard
her
murmur
is
little
jasper
safe
jasper
cried
richard

after
his
daddy
where

richard
hoarsely
in
america

the
likeness
whispered
richard
to
bellingham
it
must
be
the
villain

married
to
another
but
now
i
will
pursue
him
and
get
back
the
papers
and
he
left
the
boat
at
the
next
port
and
boarded
one
for
america
the
search
through
north
and
south
america
for
jasper
was
protracted
accompanied
sometimes
by
a
band
of
cowboys
sometimes
by
a
tribe
of
indians
richard
scoured
the
continent
for
his
enemy
there
were
hours
when
he
would
rest
awhile
and
amuse
himself
by
watching
the
antics
of
the
common
mosquito
manager
or
he
would
lie
at
full
length
and
gaze
at
a
bud
bursting
into
flower
manager
then
he
would
leap
on
to
his
steed
and
pursue
the
trail
relentlessly
once
more
one
night
he
was
dozing
by
his
when
he
was
awakened
roughly
by
strong
arms
around
his
neck
and
jasper
hot
breath
in
his
ear
at
last
cried
jasper
and
knocking
richard
heavily
on
the
head
with
a
boot
he
picked
up
his
unconscious
enemy
and
carried
him
to
a
tributary
of
the
amazon
noted
for
its
alligators
once
there
he
tied
him
to
a
post
in
and
rode
hastily
off
to
the
nearest
town
where
he
spent
the
evening
witnessing
the
first
half
of
the
merchant
of
venice
manager
but
in
the
morning
a
surprise
awaited
him
as
he
was
proceeding
along
the
top
of
a
lonely
cliff
he
was
confronted
suddenly
by
the
enemy
whom
he
had
thought
to
kill
richard
he
cried
escaped
again
now
jasper
i
have
you
with
a
triumphant
cry
they
rushed
at
each
other
a
terrible
contest
ensued
and
then
jasper
with
one
blow
of
his
palm
hurled
his
adversary
over
the
precipice
vi
how
many
times
the
two
made
an
end
of
each
other
after
this
the
pictures
will
show
sometimes
jasper
sealed
richard
in
a
barrel
and
pushed
him
over
niagara
sometimes
richard
tied
jasper
to
a
stake
and
set
light
to
him
sometimes
they
would
both
fall
out
of
a
balloon
together
but
the
day
of
reckoning
was
at
hand
manager
only
got
the
burning
house
and
the
derby
author
it
is
the
evening
of
the
of
june
a
cry
rends
the
air
suddenly
whistles
are
blowing
there
is
a
rattling
of
horses
hoofs
fire
fire
richard
who
was
passing
soho
square
at
the
time
heard
the
cry
and
dashed
into
the
burning
house
in
a
room
full
of
smoke
he
perceived
a
cowering
woman
hyacinth
to
pick
her
up
was
the
work
of
a
moment
but
how
shall
he
save
her
stay
the
telegraph
wire
his
training
at
the
royal
circus
stood
him
in
good
stead
treading
lightly
on
the
swaying
wire
he
carried
hyacinth
across
to
the
house
opposite
at
last
my
love
he
breathed
but
the
papers
she
cried
you
must
get
them
or
father
will
not
let
you
marry
me
once
more
he
treads
the
rocking
wire
once
more
he
with
the
papers
on
his
back
then
the
house
behind
him
crumbles
to
the
ground
with
the
wicked
jasper
in
its
ruins
excellent
said
bellingham
at
dinner
that
evening
not
only
are
the
papers
here
but
a
full
confession
by
jasper
my
first
wife
was
drowned
all
the
time
he
stole
the
documents
from
her
father
richard
my
boy
when
the
home
secretary
knows
everything
he
will
give
you
a
free
pardon
and
then
you
can
marry
my
daughter
at
these
words
hyacinth
and
richard
were
locked
in
a
close
embrace
on
the
next
day
they
all
went
to
the
derby
together
the
fatal
gift
people
say
to
me
sometimes
oh
know
woolman
do
you
i
acknowledge
that
i
do
and
after
the
silence
that
always
ensues
i
add
if
you
want
to
say
anything
against
him
please
go
on
you
can
almost
hear
the
sigh
of
relief
that
goes
up
i
thought
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
they
say
cheerfully
but
of
course
if
and
then
they
begin
i
think
it
is
time
i
explained
my
supposed
friendship
for
ernest
merrowby
woolman
confound
him
the
affair
began
in
a
taxicab
two
years
ago
andrew
had
been
dining
with
me
that
night
we
walked
out
to
the
together
i
told
the
driver
where
to
go
and
andrew
stepped
in
waved
to
me
from
the
window
and
sat
down
suddenly
upon
something
hard
he
drew
it
from
beneath
him
and
found
it
was
an
extremely
massive
and
quite
new
silver
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
with
the
intention
of
giving
it
to
the
driver
when
he
got
out
but
quite
naturally
forgot
next
morning
he
found
it
on
his
so
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
again
meaning
to
leave
it
at
scotland
yard
on
his
way
to
the
city
next
morning
it
was
on
his
again
this
went
on
for
some
days
after
a
week
or
so
andrew
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
get
a
back
to
scotland
yard
in
this
casual
sort
of
way
it
must
be
taken
there
deliberately
by
somebody
who
had
a
morning
to
spare
and
was
willing
to
devote
it
to
this
special
purpose
he
placed
the
case
therefore
prominently
on
a
small
table
in
the
to
await
the
occasion
calling
also
the
attention
of
his
family
to
it
as
an
excuse
for
an
outing
when
they
were
not
otherwise
engaged
at
times
he
used
to
say
i
must
really
take
that
to
scotland
yard
at
other
times
he
would
say
somebody
must
really
take
that
to
scotland
yard
and
so
the
weeks
rolled
on
it
was
about
a
year
later
that
i
first
got
mixed
up
with
the
thing
i
must
have
dined
with
the
andrews
several
times
without
noticing
the
but
on
this
occasion
it
caught
my
eye
as
we
wandered
out
to
join
the
ladies
and
i
picked
it
up
carelessly
well
not
exactly
carelessly
it
was
too
heavy
for
that
why
did
you
tell
me
i
said
that
you
had
stood
for
parliament
and
that
your
supporters
had
consoled
you
with
a
large
piece
of
plate
hallo
they
put
the
wrong
initials
on
it
how
oh
said
andrew
is
it
still
there
why
not
it
quite
a
solid
little
table
but
you
have
explained
why
your
constituents
who
must
have
seen
your
name
on
hundreds
of
posters
thought
your
initials
were
andrew
explained
then
it
is
yours
at
all
i
said
in
amazement
of
course
not
but
my
dear
man
this
is
theft
stealing
by
finding
they
call
it
you
could
get
i
looked
at
him
almost
with
admiration
you
could
get
two
years
for
this
and
i
weighed
the
in
my
hand
i
believe
you
the
only
one
of
my
friends
who
could
be
certain
of
two
years
i
went
on
musingly
let
see
there
nonsense
said
andrew
uneasily
but
still
perhaps
i
better
take
it
back
to
scotland
yard
and
tell
them
you
kept
it
for
a
year
they
run
you
in
at
once
no
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
get
rid
of
it
without
their
knowledge
but
how
that
the
question
you
ca
give
it
away
because
of
the
initials
it
easy
enough
i
can
leave
it
in
another
cab
or
drop
it
in
the
river
andrew
andrew
i
cried
you
determined
to
go
to
prison
do
you
know
from
all
the
humorous
articles
you
ever
read
that
if
you
to
lose
anything
then
you
never
can
it
one
of
the
stock
remarks
one
makes
to
women
in
the
endeavour
to
keep
them
amused
no
you
must
think
of
some
more
subtle
way
of
disposing
of
it
i
pretend
it
yours
said
andrew
more
subtly
and
he
placed
it
in
my
pocket
no
you
do
i
said
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
take
it
for
a
week
and
see
if
i
can
get
rid
of
it
if
i
ca
i
shall
give
it
you
back
and
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
business
except
of
course
for
the
monthly
letter
or
whatever
it
is
they
allow
you
at
the
scrubbs
you
may
still
count
on
me
for
that
and
then
the
extraordinary
thing
happened
the
next
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
a
stranger
asking
for
some
simple
information
which
i
could
have
given
him
on
a
and
so
i
should
have
done
or
possibly
i
am
afraid
have
forgotten
to
answer
at
all
but
for
the
way
that
the
letter
ended
up
yours
very
truly
ernest
m
woolman
the
magic
initials
it
was
a
chance
not
to
be
missed
i
wrote
enthusiastically
back
and
asked
him
to
lunch
he
came
i
gave
him
all
the
information
he
wanted
and
more
whether
he
was
a
pleasant
sort
of
person
or
not
i
hardly
noticed
i
was
so
very
pleasant
myself
he
returned
my
enthusiasm
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
the
following
week
a
little
party
at
the
savoy
his
birthday
you
know
i
accepted
gladly
i
rolled
up
at
the
party
with
my
little
present
a
massive
silver
suitably
engraved
so
there
you
are
he
clings
to
me
he
seems
to
have
formed
the
absurd
idea
that
i
am
fond
of
him
a
few
months
after
that
evening
at
the
savoy
he
was
married
i
was
invited
to
the
wedding
confound
him
of
course
i
had
to
live
up
to
my
birthday
present
the
least
i
could
do
was
an
enormous
silver
not
engraved
which
bound
me
to
him
still
more
strongly
by
that
time
i
realized
that
i
hated
him
he
was
pushing
familiar
everything
that
i
disliked
all
my
friends
wondered
how
i
had
become
so
intimate
with
him
well
now
they
know
and
the
original
if
he
has
the
sense
to
read
this
also
knows
if
he
cares
to
prosecute
ernest
merrowby
woolman
for
being
in
possession
of
stolen
goods
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
him
any
information
woolman
is
generally
to
be
found
leaving
my
rooms
at
about
in
the
evening
and
a
smart
detective
could
easily
nab
him
as
he
steps
out
a
midsummer
madness
the
girl
who
shared
herbert
meringue
at
dinner
a
brittle
one
which
exploded
just
as
he
was
getting
into
it
was
kind
and
tactful
it
does
matter
a
bit
she
said
removing
fragments
of
shell
from
her
lap
and
to
put
him
at
his
ease
again
went
on
are
you
interested
in
little
problems
at
all
herbert
who
would
have
been
interested
even
in
a
photograph
album
just
then
emerged
from
his
apologies
and
swore
that
he
was
we
all
worrying
about
one
which
father
saw
in
a
paper
i
do
wish
you
could
solve
it
for
us
it
goes
like
this
and
she
proceeded
to
explain
it
herbert
decided
that
the
small
piece
of
meringue
still
in
her
hair
was
not
worth
mentioning
and
he
listened
to
her
with
interest
on
the
next
morning
i
happened
to
drop
in
at
herbert
office
and
that
in
short
is
how
i
was
entangled
in
the
business
look
here
said
herbert
you
used
to
be
mathematical
here
something
for
you
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
i
implored
i
am
now
quite
respectable
it
goes
like
this
he
said
ignoring
my
appeal
he
then
gave
me
the
problem
which
i
hand
on
to
you
a
subaltern
riding
at
the
rear
of
a
column
of
soldiers
trotted
up
to
the
captain
in
front
and
challenged
him
to
a
game
of
billiards
for
half
a
crown
a
side
the
loser
to
pay
for
the
table
having
lost
he
played
another
hundred
double
or
quits
and
then
rode
back
the
column
by
this
time
having
travelled
twice
its
own
length
and
a
distance
equal
to
the
distance
it
would
have
travelled
if
it
had
been
going
in
the
other
direction
what
was
the
captain
name
perhaps
i
have
not
got
it
quite
right
for
i
have
had
an
eventful
week
since
then
or
perhaps
herbert
did
get
it
quite
right
or
perhaps
the
girl
with
the
meringue
in
her
hair
did
get
it
quite
right
but
anyhow
that
was
the
idea
of
it
and
the
answer
said
herbert
ought
to
be
cows
but
i
keep
on
making
it
and
tuppence
just
have
a
shot
at
it
there
a
good
fellow
i
promised
the
girl
you
know
i
sat
down
worked
it
out
hastily
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
made
it
a
yard
and
a
half
no
said
herbert
i
know
it
cows
but
i
ca
get
it
sorry
i
said
how
stupid
of
me
i
left
out
the
i
did
it
hastily
again
and
made
it
three
minutes
seconds
it
difficult
is
it
said
herbert
i
thought
as
you
used
to
be
mathematical
and
as
i
promised
the
girl
wait
a
moment
i
said
still
busy
with
my
envelope
i
forgot
the
subaltern
ah
that
right
the
answer
is
a
hundred
and
men
no
that
wrong
i
never
doubled
the
er
oh
look
here
herbert
i
rather
busy
this
morning
i
send
it
to
you
right
said
herbert
i
know
i
can
depend
on
you
because
mathematical
and
he
opened
the
door
for
me
i
had
meant
to
do
a
very
important
piece
of
work
that
day
but
i
get
my
mind
off
herbert
wretched
problem
happening
to
see
carey
at
teatime
i
mentioned
it
to
him
ah
said
carey
profoundly
h
have
you
tried
it
with
an
of
course
yes
it
looks
as
though
it
wants
a
bit
of
an
somewhere
you
stick
to
it
with
an
and
you
ought
to
do
it
let
be
the
subaltern
that
the
way
i
say
i
did
know
you
were
interested
in
problems
well
because
i
got
rather
a
tricky
chess
problem
here
i
ca
do
he
produced
his
pocket
white
mates
in
four
moves
i
looked
at
it
carelessly
black
had
only
left
himself
with
a
pawn
and
a
king
while
white
had
a
queen
and
a
couple
of
knights
about
now
i
know
very
little
about
chess
but
i
do
understand
the
theory
of
chess
problems
have
you
tried
letting
the
queen
be
taken
by
black
pawn
then
sacrificing
the
knights
and
finally
mating
him
with
the
king
alone
yes
said
carey
then
i
was
baffled
if
one
ca
solve
a
chess
problem
by
starting
off
with
the
most
thing
on
the
board
one
ca
solve
it
at
all
however
i
copied
down
the
position
and
said
i
glance
at
it
at
eleven
that
night
i
rose
from
my
glance
decided
that
herbert
problem
was
the
more
immediately
pressing
and
took
it
to
bed
with
me
i
was
lunching
with
william
next
day
and
i
told
him
about
the
subaltern
he
dashed
at
it
lightheartedly
and
made
the
answer
seventeen
seventeen
what
i
said
well
whatever
we
talking
about
i
think
you
find
it
seventeen
all
right
but
look
here
my
son
here
a
golf
problem
for
you
a
is
playing
b
at
the
fifth
hole
a
falls
off
the
tee
into
a
pond
i
forget
how
it
went
on
when
i
got
home
to
dinner
after
a
hard
day
with
the
subaltern
i
found
a
letter
from
norah
waiting
for
me
i
hear
from
carey
she
wrote
that
you
keen
on
problems
one
i
have
cut
out
of
our
local
paper
do
have
a
shot
at
it
the
answer
ought
to
be
eight
miles
an
hour
luckily
however
she
forgot
to
enclose
the
problem
for
by
this
time
what
with
herbert
subaltern
carey
pawn
and
a
cistern
left
me
by
an
uncle
who
was
dining
with
us
that
night
i
had
more
than
enough
to
distract
me
and
so
the
business
has
gone
on
the
news
that
i
am
preparing
a
collection
of
interesting
and
tricky
problems
for
a
new
encyclopaedia
has
got
about
among
my
friends
everybody
who
writes
to
me
tells
me
of
a
relation
of
his
who
has
been
shearing
sheep
or
rowing
against
the
stream
or
dealing
himself
four
aces
people
who
come
to
tea
borrow
a
box
of
wooden
matches
and
beg
me
to
remove
one
match
and
leave
a
perfect
square
i
am
asked
to
do
absurd
things
with
pennies
meanwhile
herbert
has
forgotten
both
the
problem
and
the
girl
three
evenings
later
he
shared
his
hollandaise
sauce
with
somebody
in
yellow
as
luck
would
have
it
and
she
changed
the
subject
by
wondering
if
he
read
dickens
he
is
now
going
manfully
through
bleak
house
a
chapter
a
night
and
when
he
came
to
visit
me
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
heard
of
the
man
however
i
was
not
angry
with
him
for
i
had
just
made
it
come
to
three
cows
it
is
a
cow
short
but
it
is
nearer
than
i
have
ever
been
before
and
i
think
i
shall
leave
it
at
that
indeed
both
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
say
that
i
had
better
leave
it
at
that
to
the
death
in
the
twentieth
century
cauliflower
shrieked
gaspard
volauvent
across
the
little
table
in
the
his
face
bristled
with
rage
serpent
replied
jacques
rissole
bristling
with
equal
dexterity
the
two
stout
little
men
glared
ferociously
at
each
other
then
jacques
picked
up
his
glass
and
poured
the
wine
of
the
country
over
his
head
drown
serpent
he
said
magnificently
he
beckoned
to
the
waiter
another
bottle
he
said
my
friend
has
drunk
all
this
gaspard
removed
the
wine
from
his
whiskers
with
the
local
paper
and
leant
over
the
table
towards
jacques
this
must
be
wiped
out
in
blood
he
said
slowly
you
understand
perfectly
replied
the
other
the
only
question
is
whose
name
your
weapons
said
gaspard
volauvent
grandly
aeroplanes
replied
jacques
rissole
after
a
moment
thought
bah
i
can
not
fly
then
i
win
said
jacques
simply
the
other
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
what
you
fly
no
but
i
can
learn
then
i
will
learn
too
said
gaspard
with
dignity
we
meet
in
six
months
good
jacques
pointed
to
the
ceiling
say
three
thousand
feet
up
three
thousand
four
hundred
said
gaspard
for
the
sake
of
disagreeing
after
all
that
is
for
our
seconds
to
arrange
my
friend
epinard
of
the
roullens
aerodrome
will
act
for
me
he
will
also
instruct
me
how
to
bring
serpents
to
the
ground
with
the
idea
of
cleansing
the
sky
of
cauliflowers
said
gaspard
i
shall
proceed
to
the
at
dormancourt
blanchaille
the
instructor
there
will
receive
your
friend
he
bowed
and
walked
out
details
were
soon
settled
on
a
date
six
months
ahead
the
two
combatants
would
meet
three
thousand
two
hundred
feet
above
the
little
town
in
which
they
lived
and
fight
to
the
death
in
the
event
of
both
crashing
the
one
who
crashed
last
would
be
deemed
the
victor
it
was
gaspard
second
who
insisted
on
this
clause
gaspard
himself
felt
that
it
did
not
matter
greatly
the
first
month
of
instruction
went
by
at
the
end
of
it
jacques
rissole
had
only
one
hope
it
was
that
when
he
crashed
he
should
crash
on
some
of
gaspard
family
gaspard
had
no
hope
but
one
consolation
it
was
that
no
crash
could
involve
his
stomach
which
he
invariably
left
behind
him
as
soon
as
the
aeroplane
rose
at
the
end
of
the
second
month
gaspard
wrote
to
jacques
my
friend
he
wrote
the
hatred
of
you
which
i
nurse
in
my
bosom
and
which
fills
me
with
the
desire
to
purge
you
from
the
sky
is
in
danger
of
being
transferred
to
my
instructor
let
us
therefore
meet
and
renew
our
enmity
jacques
rissole
wrote
back
to
gaspard
my
enemy
he
wrote
there
is
nobody
in
the
whole
of
the
roullens
aerodrome
whom
i
do
not
detest
with
a
detestation
beside
which
my
hatred
for
you
seems
as
maudlin
adoration
this
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
make
the
most
marvellous
progress
in
the
art
of
flying
it
is
merely
something
in
their
faces
which
annoys
me
let
me
therefore
see
yours
again
in
the
hope
that
it
will
make
me
think
more
kindly
of
theirs
they
met
poured
wine
over
each
other
and
parted
after
another
month
the
need
of
a
further
stimulant
was
felt
they
met
again
and
agreed
to
insult
each
other
weekly
on
the
last
day
of
his
training
gaspard
spoke
seriously
to
his
instructor
you
see
that
i
make
nothing
of
it
he
said
my
thoughts
are
ever
with
the
stomach
that
i
leave
behind
not
once
have
i
been
in
a
position
to
take
control
how
then
can
i
fight
my
friend
i
arrange
it
all
you
shall
take
my
place
is
that
quite
fair
to
rissole
asked
blanchaille
doubtfully
do
not
think
that
i
want
you
to
hurt
him
that
is
not
necessary
he
will
hurt
himself
keep
out
of
his
way
until
he
has
finished
with
himself
and
then
fly
back
here
it
is
easy
it
seemed
the
best
way
indeed
the
only
way
gaspard
volauvent
could
never
get
to
the
rendezvous
alone
and
it
would
be
fatal
to
his
honour
if
jacques
arrived
there
and
found
nobody
to
meet
him
reluctantly
blanchaille
agreed
at
the
appointed
hour
gaspard
put
his
head
cautiously
out
of
his
bedroom
window
and
gazed
up
into
the
heavens
he
saw
two
aeroplanes
straight
above
him
at
the
thought
that
he
might
have
been
in
one
of
them
he
shuddered
violently
indeed
he
felt
so
unwell
that
the
need
for
some
slight
restorative
became
pressing
he
tripped
off
to
the
it
was
empty
save
for
one
table
gaspard
walked
towards
it
hoping
for
a
little
conversation
the
occupant
lowered
the
newspaper
from
in
front
of
his
face
and
looked
up
it
was
too
much
for
gaspard
coward
he
shrieked
jacques
who
had
been
going
to
say
the
same
thing
hastily
substituted
serpent
i
know
you
cried
gaspard
you
send
your
instructor
up
in
your
place
poltroon
jacques
picked
up
his
glass
and
poured
the
wine
of
the
country
over
his
friend
head
drown
serpent
he
said
magnificently
he
beckoned
to
the
waiter
another
bottle
he
said
my
friend
has
drunk
all
this
gaspard
removed
the
wine
from
his
whiskers
with
jacques
paper
and
leant
over
him
this
must
be
wiped
out
in
blood
he
said
slowly
name
your
weapons
submarines
said
jacques
after
a
moment
thought
the
handicap
of
sex
i
found
myself
in
the
same
with
anne
the
other
day
so
i
offered
her
one
of
my
favourite
sandwiches
i
had
seen
her
for
some
time
and
there
were
plenty
in
the
plate
if
you
are
coming
to
talk
to
me
she
said
i
think
i
had
better
warn
you
that
i
am
a
bolshevist
then
you
wo
want
a
sandwich
i
said
gladly
and
i
withdrew
the
plate
i
suppose
said
anne
that
what
i
really
want
is
a
vote
have
you
got
one
sorry
i
mean
of
course
you
have
got
one
but
it
is
only
that
i
want
to
see
the
whole
position
of
women
altered
i
want
to
see
i
looked
round
for
her
mother
tell
me
i
said
gently
when
did
this
come
over
you
in
the
last
few
weeks
said
anne
and
i
do
wonder
i
settled
down
with
the
sandwiches
to
listen
anne
first
noted
symptoms
of
it
at
a
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
she
had
asked
the
young
man
on
her
right
if
she
could
have
some
of
his
salt
and
as
he
passed
it
to
her
he
covered
up
any
embarrassment
she
might
be
feeling
by
saying
genially
well
and
how
long
is
this
coal
strike
going
to
last
i
do
know
said
anne
truthfully
i
suppose
you
ready
for
the
revolution
the
and
all
the
spare
bedrooms
well
stocked
anne
saw
that
this
was
meant
humorously
and
she
laughed
i
expect
we
shall
be
all
right
she
said
you
have
to
give
a
and
invite
all
your
friends
what
a
lovely
idea
said
anne
smiling
from
sheer
habit
mind
you
come
she
got
her
face
straight
again
with
a
jerk
and
turned
to
the
solemn
old
gentleman
on
her
other
side
he
was
ready
for
her
this
is
a
terrible
disaster
for
the
country
this
coal
strike
he
said
is
it
said
anne
and
feeling
that
that
was
inadequate
added
terrible
i
do
know
what
happening
to
the
country
anne
crumbled
her
bread
and
having
reviewed
a
succession
of
possible
replies
each
more
fatuous
than
the
last
decided
to
remain
silent
everything
will
be
at
a
standstill
directly
her
companion
went
on
already
trade
is
leaving
the
country
america
i
suppose
so
said
anne
gloomily
once
stop
the
supplies
of
coal
you
see
and
you
drain
the
of
the
country
of
said
anne
and
looked
very
serious
after
lunch
an
extremely
brisk
little
man
took
her
in
hand
have
you
been
studying
this
coal
strike
question
at
all
he
began
i
read
the
papers
said
anne
ah
but
you
do
it
there
they
do
you
they
you
now
i
know
a
man
who
is
actually
it
and
he
and
he
knows
this
for
a
that
from
the
when
the
downed
tools
from
the
very
moment
when
he
anne
edged
away
from
him
nervously
her
face
had
assumed
an
expression
of
wild
interest
which
she
was
certain
could
last
much
longer
now
take
coal
at
the
pit
mouth
he
went
on
at
the
he
shook
a
forefinger
at
her
at
the
and
i
know
this
for
a
the
the
royalties
are
it
awful
said
anne
i
she
went
home
feeling
a
little
disturbed
there
was
something
in
her
mind
a
dim
sense
of
foreboding
which
kept
casting
its
shadow
across
her
pleasanter
thoughts
just
as
you
feel
she
said
when
you
you
got
to
go
to
the
dentist
but
they
had
a
big
that
evening
and
anne
full
of
the
joy
of
life
was
not
going
to
let
anything
stand
in
the
way
of
her
enjoyment
of
it
her
man
began
on
the
stairs
well
he
said
what
about
the
coal
strike
when
are
you
going
to
start
your
they
say
that
that
going
to
be
the
new
rage
he
smiled
reassuringly
at
her
he
was
giving
the
impression
that
he
have
been
very
very
serious
over
this
terrible
business
but
that
for
her
sake
he
was
wearing
the
mask
in
the
presence
of
women
a
man
must
make
light
of
danger
anne
understood
then
what
was
troubling
her
and
as
through
dinner
the
man
on
her
other
side
turned
to
talk
to
her
she
shot
an
urgent
question
at
him
at
any
cost
she
must
know
the
worst
long
will
the
strike
last
she
said
earnestly
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
he
said
i
fear
it
may
be
months
anne
sighed
deeply
i
took
the
last
sandwich
and
put
down
the
plate
and
that
said
anne
was
three
weeks
ago
it
has
been
the
same
ever
since
i
asked
beginning
on
a
new
plate
every
day
i
tired
of
it
i
shrink
from
every
new
man
i
meet
i
wait
nervously
for
the
word
feeling
that
i
shall
scream
when
it
comes
oh
i
want
a
vote
or
something
i
do
know
what
i
want
but
i
men
why
should
they
think
that
everything
they
say
to
us
is
funny
or
clever
or
important
why
should
they
talk
to
us
as
if
we
were
children
why
should
they
take
it
for
granted
that
it
our
duty
to
always
i
rose
with
dignity
dash
it
all
who
had
been
doing
the
listening
for
the
last
you
are
run
down
i
said
what
you
want
is
a
tonic
quite
between
ourselves
though
i
really
think
but
no
we
men
must
stick
together
the
legend
of
i
in
the
days
of
good
king
carraway
dead
now
poor
fellow
but
he
had
a
pleasant
time
while
he
lasted
there
lived
a
certain
swineherd
commonly
called
it
was
the
duty
of
to
bring
up
one
hundred
and
pigs
for
his
master
and
this
he
did
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
the
work
permitted
but
there
were
times
when
his
profession
failed
him
in
the
blue
days
of
summer
princes
and
princesses
lords
and
ladies
chamberlains
and
enchanters
would
ride
past
him
and
leave
him
vaguely
dissatisfied
with
his
company
so
that
he
would
remove
the
straw
from
his
mouth
and
gaze
after
them
wondering
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
as
little
regard
for
a
swineherd
as
they
but
when
they
were
out
of
sight
he
would
replace
the
straw
in
his
mouth
and
fall
with
great
diligence
to
the
counting
of
his
herd
and
such
other
duties
as
are
required
of
the
expert
pigtender
assuring
himself
that
if
a
man
could
not
be
lively
with
one
hundred
and
companions
he
must
indeed
be
a
sort
of
fellow
now
there
was
one
little
black
pig
for
whom
had
a
special
tenderness
just
so
he
often
used
to
think
would
he
have
felt
towards
a
brother
if
this
had
been
granted
to
him
it
was
not
the
colour
of
the
little
pig
nor
the
curliness
of
his
tail
endearing
though
this
was
nor
even
the
melting
expression
in
his
eyes
which
warmed
the
heart
but
the
feeling
that
intellectually
this
pig
was
as
solitary
among
the
hundred
and
forty
others
as
himself
frederick
for
this
was
the
name
which
he
had
given
to
it
shared
their
food
their
sleeping
apartments
much
indeed
as
did
but
he
lived
or
so
it
seemed
to
the
other
an
inner
life
of
his
own
in
short
frederick
was
a
soulful
pig
there
could
be
only
one
reason
for
this
frederick
was
a
prince
in
disguise
some
enchanter
it
was
a
common
enough
happening
in
those
days
annoyed
by
frederick
father
or
his
uncle
or
even
by
frederick
himself
had
turned
him
into
a
small
black
pig
until
such
time
as
the
feeling
between
them
had
passed
away
there
was
a
prince
frederick
of
milvania
who
had
disappeared
suddenly
probably
this
was
he
his
complexion
was
darker
now
his
tail
more
curly
but
the
royal
bearing
was
unmistakable
it
was
natural
then
that
having
little
in
common
with
his
other
hundred
and
forty
charges
should
find
himself
drawn
into
ever
closer
companionship
with
frederick
they
would
talk
together
in
the
intervals
of
frederick
share
of
the
conversation
limited
to
humphs
unintelligible
at
first
but
as
the
days
went
on
seeming
more
and
more
charged
with
an
inner
meaning
to
until
at
last
he
could
interpret
every
variation
of
grunt
with
which
his
small
black
friend
responded
and
indeed
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
them
sitting
together
on
the
top
of
a
hill
the
world
at
their
feet
discussing
at
one
time
the
political
situation
of
milvania
at
another
the
latest
ballad
of
the
countryside
or
even
in
their
more
hopeful
moments
planning
what
they
should
do
when
frederick
at
last
was
restored
to
public
life
ii
now
it
chanced
that
one
morning
when
frederick
and
were
arguing
together
in
a
friendly
manner
over
the
new
uniforms
of
the
town
guard
to
the
colours
of
which
frederick
took
exception
king
carraway
himself
passed
that
way
and
being
in
a
good
humour
stood
for
a
moment
listening
to
them
well
well
he
said
at
last
well
well
well
in
great
surprise
looked
up
and
then
seeing
that
it
was
the
king
jumped
to
his
feet
and
bowed
several
times
pardon
your
majesty
he
stammered
i
did
not
see
your
majesty
i
was
i
was
talking
to
a
pig
laughed
the
king
to
his
royal
highness
prince
frederick
of
milvania
said
proudly
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
king
could
i
trouble
you
to
say
that
again
his
royal
highness
prince
frederick
of
milvania
yes
that
was
what
it
sounded
like
last
time
frederick
murmured
in
his
friend
ear
this
is
his
majesty
king
carraway
he
lets
me
call
him
frederick
he
added
to
the
king
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
said
his
majesty
pointing
to
the
pig
that
is
prince
frederick
it
is
indeed
sire
such
distressing
incidents
must
often
have
occurred
within
your
majesty
recollection
they
have
yes
dear
me
dear
me
humph
remarked
frederick
feeling
it
was
time
he
said
something
his
royal
highness
says
that
he
is
very
proud
to
meet
so
distinguished
a
monarch
as
your
majesty
did
he
say
that
asked
the
king
surprised
undoubtedly
your
majesty
very
good
of
him
i
sure
humph
said
frederick
again
he
adds
explained
that
your
majesty
great
valour
is
only
excelled
by
the
distinction
of
your
majesty
appearance
dear
me
said
the
king
i
thought
he
was
merely
repeating
himself
it
seems
to
me
very
clever
of
you
to
understand
so
exactly
what
he
is
saying
humph
said
frederick
feeling
that
it
was
about
acorn
time
again
his
royal
highness
is
kind
enough
to
say
that
we
are
very
old
friends
yes
of
course
that
must
make
a
difference
one
soon
picks
it
up
no
doubt
but
we
must
not
be
inhospitable
to
so
distinguished
a
visitor
certainly
he
must
stay
with
us
at
the
palace
and
you
had
better
come
along
too
my
man
for
it
may
well
be
that
without
your
aid
some
of
his
royal
highness
conversation
would
escape
us
prince
frederick
of
milvania
dear
me
dear
me
this
will
be
news
for
her
royal
highness
so
leaving
the
rest
of
the
herd
to
look
after
itself
as
it
was
quite
capable
of
doing
frederick
and
went
to
the
palace
now
her
royal
highness
princess
amaril
was
of
an
age
to
be
married
many
princes
had
sought
her
hand
but
in
vain
for
she
was
as
proud
as
she
was
beautiful
indeed
her
beauty
was
so
great
that
those
who
looked
upon
it
were
blinded
as
if
they
had
gazed
upon
the
sun
at
noonday
or
so
the
court
poet
said
and
he
would
not
be
likely
to
exaggerate
wherefore
was
filled
with
a
great
apprehension
as
he
walked
to
the
palace
and
frederick
to
whom
the
matter
had
been
explained
was
it
may
be
presumed
equally
stirred
within
although
outwardly
impassive
and
as
they
went
murmured
to
his
companion
that
it
was
quite
all
right
for
that
in
any
event
she
could
not
eat
them
the
which
assurance
frederick
no
doubt
was
peculiarly
glad
to
receive
ah
said
the
king
as
they
were
shown
into
the
royal
library
right
he
turned
to
the
princess
my
dear
prepare
for
a
surprise
yes
father
said
amaril
dutifully
this
said
his
majesty
dramatically
throwing
out
a
hand
is
a
prince
in
disguise
which
one
father
said
amaril
the
small
black
one
of
course
said
the
king
crossly
the
other
is
merely
his
attendant
hi
you
what
your
name
the
swineherd
hastened
to
explain
that
his
majesty
with
his
unfailing
memory
for
names
had
graciously
mentioned
it
you
do
say
anything
said
the
king
to
his
daughter
princess
amaril
sighed
he
is
very
handsome
father
she
said
looking
at
said
the
king
regarding
frederick
who
was
combing
himself
thoughtfully
behind
the
left
ear
with
considerable
doubt
but
the
real
beauty
of
prince
frederick
character
does
not
lie
upon
the
surface
or
anyhow
er
not
at
the
moment
no
father
sighed
amaril
and
she
looked
at
again
now
the
swineherd
who
with
instinctive
good
breeding
had
taken
the
straw
from
his
mouth
on
entering
the
palace
was
a
young
fellow
such
as
might
please
even
a
princess
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
in
the
royal
library
until
frederick
realized
that
it
was
his
turn
to
speak
humph
said
frederick
there
said
the
king
in
great
good
humour
now
my
dear
let
me
tell
you
what
that
means
that
means
that
his
royal
highness
is
delighted
to
meet
so
beautiful
and
distinguished
a
princess
he
turned
to
is
that
right
my
man
perfectly
correct
your
majesty
you
see
my
dear
said
the
king
complacently
one
soon
picks
it
up
now
in
a
few
days
humph
said
frederick
again
what
did
that
one
mean
father
asked
amaril
that
meant
er
that
meant
well
it
a
little
hard
to
put
it
colloquially
but
roughly
it
means
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
that
we
have
er
been
having
very
charming
weather
lately
he
frowned
vigorously
at
the
swineherd
exactly
your
majesty
said
charming
weather
for
the
time
of
year
for
the
time
of
year
of
course
said
the
king
hastily
one
naturally
assumes
that
well
my
dear
he
went
on
to
his
daughter
i
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
prince
frederick
has
consented
to
stay
with
us
for
a
little
you
will
give
orders
that
suitable
apartments
are
to
be
prepared
yes
father
what
suitable
apartments
the
king
pulled
at
his
beard
and
regarded
frederick
doubtfully
perhaps
it
would
be
better
the
princess
went
on
looking
at
if
this
gentleman
of
course
my
dear
of
course
naturally
his
royal
highness
would
wish
to
retain
his
suite
humph
said
frederick
meaning
i
imagine
that
things
were
looking
up
iii
of
all
the
princes
who
from
time
to
time
had
visited
the
court
none
endeared
himself
so
rapidly
to
the
people
as
did
frederick
of
milvania
his
complete
lack
of
vanity
his
thoughtfulness
the
intense
reserve
which
so
obviously
indicated
a
strong
character
his
power
of
listening
placidly
to
even
the
most
tedious
of
local
dignitaries
all
these
were
virtues
of
which
previous
royal
visitors
had
given
no
sign
moreover
on
set
occasions
prince
frederick
could
make
a
very
pretty
speech
true
this
was
read
for
him
owing
to
a
slight
affection
of
the
throat
from
which
as
the
chancellor
pointed
out
his
royal
highness
was
temporarily
suffering
but
it
would
be
couched
in
the
most
perfect
taste
and
seasoned
at
suitable
functions
such
for
instance
as
the
opening
of
the
first
public
baths
with
a
pleasantly
restrained
humour
nor
was
there
any
doubt
that
the
words
were
indeed
the
prince
own
as
dictated
to
and
by
him
put
on
paper
for
the
chancellor
but
himself
never
left
the
palace
my
dear
said
the
king
to
his
daughter
one
day
have
you
ever
thought
of
marriage
often
father
said
amaril
i
understand
from
the
chancellor
that
the
people
are
expecting
an
announcement
on
the
subject
shortly
we
have
got
anything
to
announce
have
we
it
a
pity
that
you
were
so
hasty
with
your
other
suitors
said
the
king
thoughtfully
there
is
hardly
a
prince
left
who
is
in
any
way
eligible
except
prince
frederick
said
amaril
gently
the
king
looked
at
her
suspiciously
and
then
looked
away
again
pulling
at
his
beard
of
course
went
on
amaril
i
do
know
what
your
loving
subjects
would
say
about
it
my
loving
subjects
said
the
king
grimly
have
been
properly
brought
up
they
believe
they
have
my
authority
for
believing
that
they
are
suffering
from
a
disability
of
the
eyesight
laid
upon
them
by
a
wicked
enchanter
under
which
they
see
princes
as
er
pigs
that
if
you
remember
was
this
fellow
suggestion
and
a
very
sensible
one
but
do
you
want
frederick
as
a
well
that
the
question
in
his
present
shape
he
is
perhaps
not
quite
not
quite
well
how
shall
i
put
it
not
quite
suggested
amaril
exactly
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
the
announcement
of
a
betrothal
the
marriage
of
course
would
not
be
announced
until
until
the
enchanter
had
removed
his
spell
from
the
eyes
of
the
people
quite
so
you
have
no
objection
to
that
my
dear
i
am
his
majesty
subject
said
amaril
dutifully
that
a
good
girl
he
patted
the
top
of
her
head
and
dismissed
her
so
the
betrothal
of
his
royal
highness
frederick
of
milvania
to
the
princess
amaril
was
announced
to
the
great
joy
of
the
people
and
in
the
depths
of
the
palace
the
swineherd
was
hard
at
work
compounding
a
potion
which
he
assured
the
king
would
restore
frederick
to
his
own
princely
form
and
sometimes
the
princess
amaril
would
help
him
at
his
work
iv
a
month
went
by
and
then
came
to
the
king
with
news
he
had
compounded
the
magic
potion
a
few
drops
sprinkled
discriminately
on
frederick
would
restore
him
to
his
earlier
shape
and
the
wedding
could
then
be
announced
well
my
man
said
his
majesty
genially
this
is
indeed
pleasant
hearing
we
will
sprinkle
frederick
really
i
am
very
much
in
your
debt
remind
me
after
the
ceremony
to
speak
to
the
lord
treasurer
about
the
matter
say
no
more
begged
all
i
ask
is
to
be
allowed
to
depart
in
peace
let
me
have
a
few
hours
alone
with
his
royal
highness
in
the
form
in
which
i
have
known
him
so
long
and
then
when
he
is
himself
again
let
me
go
for
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
remain
here
as
a
perpetual
reminder
to
his
royal
highness
of
what
he
would
fain
forget
well
that
very
handsome
of
you
very
handsome
indeed
i
see
your
point
yes
it
is
better
that
you
should
go
but
before
you
go
there
is
just
one
thing
the
people
are
under
the
impression
that
er
an
enchanter
has
er
well
you
remember
what
you
yourself
suggested
i
have
thought
of
that
said
who
seemed
to
have
thought
of
everything
and
i
venture
to
propose
that
your
majesty
should
announce
that
a
great
alchemist
has
been
compounding
a
potion
to
relieve
their
blindness
a
few
drops
of
this
will
be
introduced
into
the
water
of
the
public
baths
and
all
those
bathing
therein
will
be
healed
a
striking
notion
said
the
king
indeed
it
was
just
about
to
occur
to
me
i
will
proclaim
a
public
holiday
and
give
orders
that
it
be
celebrated
in
the
baths
then
in
the
evening
when
they
are
all
clean
i
should
say
we
will
present
their
prince
to
them
so
it
happened
even
as
had
said
and
in
the
evening
the
prince
a
model
now
of
manly
beauty
was
presented
to
them
and
they
acclaimed
him
with
cheers
and
all
noticed
how
lovingly
the
princess
regarded
him
and
how
he
smiled
upon
her
but
the
king
gazed
upon
the
prince
as
one
fascinated
seven
times
he
cleared
his
throat
and
seven
times
he
failed
to
speak
and
the
eighth
time
he
said
your
face
is
strangely
familiar
to
me
perchance
we
met
in
milvania
said
the
prince
pleasantly
now
the
king
had
never
been
in
milvania
wherefore
he
still
gazed
at
the
prince
and
at
length
he
said
what
has
happened
to
that
fellow
you
will
never
hear
of
him
again
said
the
prince
pleasantly
oh
said
the
king
and
after
that
they
feasted
and
some
say
that
they
feasted
upon
roast
pig
but
i
say
not
and
some
say
that
had
planned
it
all
from
the
beginning
but
i
say
not
and
some
say
that
it
was
the
princess
amaril
who
planned
it
from
the
day
when
first
she
saw
and
with
them
i
agree
for
indeed
i
am
very
sure
that
when
was
a
swineherd
upon
the
hills
he
believed
truly
that
the
little
black
pig
with
the
curly
tail
was
a
prince
and
though
events
in
the
end
were
too
much
for
him
i
like
to
think
that
remained
loyal
to
his
friend
and
that
in
his
sty
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
palace
grounds
frederick
passed
a
gentle
old
age
cheered
from
time
to
time
by
the
visits
of
amaril
children
