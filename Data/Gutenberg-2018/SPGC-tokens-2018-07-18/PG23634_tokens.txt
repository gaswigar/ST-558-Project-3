preface
the
growing
interest
in
the
popular
tales
of
europe
has
led
me
to
believe
that
a
selection
from
those
of
italy
would
be
entertaining
to
the
general
reader
and
valuable
to
the
student
of
comparative
the
stories
which
with
but
few
exceptions
are
here
presented
for
the
first
time
to
the
english
reader
have
been
translated
from
recent
italian
collections
and
are
given
exactly
as
they
were
taken
down
from
the
mouths
of
the
people
and
it
is
in
this
sense
belonging
to
the
people
that
the
word
popular
is
used
in
the
title
of
this
work
i
have
occasionally
changed
the
present
to
the
past
tense
and
slightly
condensed
by
the
omission
of
tiresome
repetitions
a
but
otherwise
my
versions
follow
the
original
closely
too
closely
perhaps
in
the
case
of
the
sicilian
tales
which
when
recited
are
very
dramatic
but
seem
disjointed
and
abrupt
when
read
footnote
a
other
condensations
are
indicated
by
brackets
the
notes
are
intended
to
supplement
those
of
pitrè
and
köhler
by
citing
the
stories
published
since
the
novelle
e
and
the
and
also
to
furnish
easy
reference
to
the
parallel
stories
of
the
rest
of
europe
as
the
notes
are
primarily
intended
for
students
i
have
simply
pointed
out
the
most
convenient
sources
of
information
and
those
to
which
i
have
had
access
my
space
has
obliged
me
to
restrict
my
notes
to
what
seemed
to
me
the
most
important
and
i
have
as
a
rule
given
only
references
which
i
have
verified
myself
my
object
has
been
simply
to
present
to
the
reader
and
student
unacquainted
with
the
italian
dialects
a
tolerably
complete
collection
of
italian
popular
tales
with
theories
as
to
the
origin
and
diffusion
of
popular
tales
in
general
or
of
italian
popular
tales
in
particular
i
have
nothing
to
do
at
present
either
in
the
text
or
notes
it
is
for
others
to
draw
such
inferences
as
this
collection
seems
to
warrant
it
was
of
course
impossible
in
my
limited
space
to
do
more
than
give
a
small
selection
from
the
class
of
fairy
tales
numbering
several
hundred
of
the
other
classes
nearly
everything
has
been
given
that
has
been
published
down
to
the
present
date
the
fairy
tales
were
selected
to
represent
as
well
as
possible
typical
stories
or
classes
and
i
have
followed
in
my
arrangement
with
some
modification
and
condensation
hahn

und
albanesische
vol
an
english
version
of
which
may
be
found
in
henderson
on
the
of
the
northern
counties
of
england
and
the
borders
with
an
appendix
on
household
by
london
in
conclusion
i
must
express
my
many
obligations
to
giuseppe
pitrè
of
palermo
without
whose
admirable
collection
this
work
would
hardly
have
been
undertaken
and
to
the
library
of

so
generously
throws
open
its
treasures

favored

introduction
by
popular
tales
we
mean
the
stories
that
are
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
from
one
generation
to
another
of
the
illiterate
people
serving
almost
exclusively
to
amuse
and
but
seldom
to
instruct
these
stories
may
be
roughly
divided
into
three
classes
nursery
tales
fairy
stories
and
jests
in
countries
where
the
people
are
generally
educated
the
first
two
classes
form
but
one
where
on
the
other
hand
the
people
still
retain
the
credulity
and
simplicity
of
childhood
the
stories
which
with
us
are
confined
to
the
nursery
amuse
the
fathers
and
mothers
as
well
as
the
children
these
stories
were
regarded
with
contempt
by
the
learned
until
the
famous
scholars
the
brothers
grimm
went
about
germany
some
sixty
years
ago
collecting
this
fast
disappearing
literature
of
the
people
the
interesting
character
of
these
tales
and
the
scientific
value
attributed
to
them
by
their
collectors
led
others
to
follow
their
footsteps
and
there
is
now
scarcely
a
province
of
germany
that
has
not
one
or
more
volumes
devoted
to
its
local
popular
tales
the
impulse
given
by
the
grimms
was
not
confined
to
their
own
country
but
extended
over
all
europe
and
within
the
last
twenty
years
more
than
fifty
volumes
have
been
published
containing
the
popular
tales
of
iceland
greenland
norway
sweden
russia
germany
england
scotland
france
biscay
spain
portugal
and
greece
asia
and
africa
have
contributed
stories
from
india
china
japan
and
south
africa
in
addition
to
these
we
have
now
to
mention
what
has
been
done
in
this
field
in
italy
from
their
very
nature
the
stories
we
are
now
considering
were
long
confined
to
the
common
people
and
were
preserved
and
transmitted
solely
by
oral
tradition
it
did
not
occur
to
any
one
to
write
them
down
from
the
lips
of
the
people
until
within
the
present
century
the
existence
of
these
stories
is
however
revealed
by
occasional
references
and
many
of
them
have
been
preserved
but
not
in
their
original
form
in
books
designed
to
entertain
more
cultivated
readers
the
earliest
literary
collection
of
stories
having
a
popular
origin
was
made
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
an
italian
giovan
francesco
straparola
of
caravaggio
it
is
astonishing
that
a
person
of
popularity
should
have
left
behind
him
nothing
but
a
name
we
only
know
that
he
was
born
near
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
at
caravaggio
now
a
small
town
half
way
between
milan
and
cremona
but
during
the
middle
ages
an
important
city
belonging
to
the
duchy
of
milan
in
he
published
at
venice
a
collection
of
stories
in
the
style
of
the
which
was
received
with
the
greatest
favor
it
passed
through
sixteen
editions
in
twenty
years
was
translated
into
french
and
often
printed
in
that
language
and
before
the
end
of
the
century
was
turned
into
german
the
author
feigns
that
francesca
gonzaga
daughter
of
ottaviano
sforza
duke
of
milan
on
account
of
commotions
in
that
city
retires
to
the
island
of
murano
near
venice
and
surrounded
by
a
number
of
distinguished
ladies
and
gentlemen
passes
the
time
in
listening
to
stories
related
by
the
company
thirteen
nights
are
spent
in
this
way
and
stories
are
told
when
the
approach
of
lent
cuts
short
the
diversion
these
stories
are
of
the
most
varied
form
and
origin
many
are
borrowed
without
acknowledgment
from
other
writers
for
example
from
the
little
known
morlini
fifteen
from
boccaccio
sachetti
brevio
ser
giovanni
the
the
golden
legend
and
the
of
six
others
are
of
oriental
origin
and
may
be
found
in
the
and
and
one
there
remain
then
stories
the
property
of
straparola
of
which
are
or
popular
tales
we
say
the
property
of
straparola
we
mean
they
had
never
appeared
before
in
the
of
europe
but
they
were
in
no
sense
original
with
straparola
being
the
common
property
which
the
occident
has
inherited
from
the
orient
there
is
no
need
of
mentioning
in
detail
here
these
stories
as
they
are
frequently
cited
in
the
notes
of
the
present
work
and
one
the
original
of
the
various
modern
versions
of
puss
in
boots
is
given
at
length
in
the
notes
to
chapter
i
two
of
straparola
stories
have
survived
their
author
oblivion
and
still
live
in
perrault
and
chat
while
others
in
the
witty
versions
of
madame
delighted
the
french
society
of
the
seventeenth
century
straparola
work
had
no
influence
on
contemporary
italian
literature
and
was
soon
forgotten
an
unjust
oblivion
for
to
him
belongs
the
honor
of
having
introduced
the
fairy
tale
into
modern
european
literature
he
has
been
criticised
for
his
style
and
blamed
for
his
immorality
the
former
it
seems
to
us
is
not
bad
and
the
latter
no
worse
than
that
of
many
contemporaneous
writers
who
have
escaped
the
severe
judgment
meted
out
to
straparola
we
find
no
further
traces
of
popular
tales
until
nearly
a
century
later
when
the
first
edition
of
the
celebrated
appeared
at
naples
in
its
author
giambattista
basile
known
as
a
writer
by
the
anagram
of
his
name
gian
alesio
abbattutis
is
but
little
better
known
to
us
than
straparola
he
spent
his
youth
in
crete
became
known
to
the
venetians
and
was
received
into
the
degli
he
followed
his
sister
adriana
a
celebrated
cantatrice
to
mantua
enjoyed
the
duke
favor
roamed
much
over
italy
and
finally
returned
to
naples
near
where
he
died
in
the
as
its
title
implies
is
a
collection
of
fifty
stories
in
the
neapolitan
dialect
supposed
to
be
narrated
during
five
days
by
ten
old
women
for
the
entertainment
of
the
person
moorish
slave
who
has
usurped
the
place
of
the
rightful
princess
basile
work
enjoyed
the
greatest
popularity
in
italy
and
was
translated
into
italian
and
into
the
dialect
of
bologna
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
the
first
fairy
tale
which
appeared
in
france
and
was
the
of
the
host
that
soon
followed
under
the
lead
of
charles
perrault
is
found
in
the
we
know
nothing
of
the
sources
of
basile
work
but
it
contains
the
most
popular
and
extended
of
all
european
tales
and
must
have
been
in
a
great
measure
drawn
directly
from
popular
tradition
the
style
is
a
wonderful
mass
of
conceits
which
do
not
however
impair
the
interest
in
the
material
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
people
in
europe
possesses
such
a
monument
of
its
popular
tales
as
the
its
influence
on
italian
literature
was
not
greater
than
that
of
straparola
from
the
lorenzo
lippi
took
the
materials
for
the
second
of
his
and
carlo
gozzi
drew
on
it
for
his
curious
the
earliest
dramatizations
of
fairy
tales
which
in
our
day
after
amusing
the
nursery
have
again
become
the
vehicles
of
spectacular
dramas
although
there
is
no
proof
that
mlle
lhéritier
and
perrault
took
their
stories
from
straparola
and
the
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
french
translation
of
the
former
which
was
very
popular
jannet
mentions
fourteen
editions
between
and
awakened
an
interest
in
this
class
of
stories
and
was
thus
the
origin
of
that
copious
french
fairy
literature
which
besides
the
names
mentioned
above
includes
such
writers
as
mde
the
countess
murat
mlle
de
la
force
and
count
caylus
all
of
whom
drew
on
their
italian
prototypes
more
or
less
popular
as
were
the
two
collections
above
mentioned
they
produced
but
one
imitation
a
collection
of
five
stories
in
the
neapolitan
dialect
and
in
the
style
of
the
by
pompeo
sarnelli
bishop
of
bisceglie
whose
anagram
is
masillo
reppone
the
first
edition
appeared
at
naples
in
and
it
has
been
republished
twice
since
then
at
the
same
place
the
work
is
exceedingly
coarse
and
has
fallen
into
oblivion
nearly
two
centuries
elapsed
before
another
collection
of
italian
tales
made
its
appearance
the
interest
that
the
brothers
grimm
aroused
in
germany
for
the
collection
and
preservation
of
popular
traditions
did
not
for
obvious
reasons
extend
to
italy
a
people
must
first
have
a
consciousness
of
its
own
nationality
before
it
can
take
sufficient
interest
in
its
literature
to
inspire
even
its
scholars
to
collect
its
traditions
for
the
sake
of
science
to
say
nothing
of
collections
for
entertainment
in
temistocle
gradi
of
siena
published
in
his
di
pasqua
di
eight
and
in
his
di
letterature
four
popular
tales
as
related
in
siena
these
were
collected
without
any
other
aim
than
that
of
entertainment
but
are
valuable
for
purposes
of
comparison
no
attempt
at
a
scientific
collection
of
tales
was
made
until
when
professor
de
gubernatis
published
the
di
santo
containing
stories
preceded
by
an
introduction
on
the
relationship
of
the
myth
to
the
popular
tale
this
was
the
forerunner
of
numerous
collections
from
the
various
provinces
of
italy
which
will
be
found
noted
in
the
bibliography
the
attention
of
strangers
was
early
directed
to
italian
tales
and
the
earliest
scientific
collection
was
the
work
of
two
germans
georg
widter
and
adam
wolf
who
published
a
translation
of
venetian
tales
in
the
für
romanische
und
englische
vol
vii
pp
with
comparative
notes
by
köhler
in
the
same
volume
were
published
pp
twelve
tales
from
leghorn
collected
by
hermann
knust
and
finally
the
eighth
volume
of
the
same
periodical
pp
contains
three
stories
from
the
neighborhood
of
sora
in
naples
in
schneller
published
at
innsbruck
a
german
translation
of
tales
collected
by
him
in
the
italian
tyrol
of
much
greater
interest
and
importance
than
any
of
the
above
are
the
two
volumes
of
sicilian
tales
collected
and
translated
into
german
by
laura
gonzenbach
afterwards
the
wife
of
the
italian
general
la
racine
there
are
but
two
other
collections
of
italian
stories
by
foreigners
miss
of
and
the
anonymous
fairy
recently
published
the
number
of
stories
published
in
german
and
english
is
about
twice
as
many
as
those
published
in
italian
before
pitrè
collection
being
over
four
hundred
pitrè
contains
more
than
all
the
previous
italian
publications
together
embracing
over
three
hundred
tales
besides
those
previously
published
by
him
in
periodicals
and
elsewhere
since
pitrè
collection
the
three
works
of
comparetti
visentini
and
nerucci
have
added
one
hundred
and
eighty
tales
not
to
speak
of
wedding
publications
containing
from
one
to
five
stories
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
examine
separately
all
these
collections
we
will
mention
briefly
the
most
important
to
imbriani
is
due
the
first
collection
of
tales
taken
down
from
the
mouths
of
the
people
and
compared
with
previously
published
italian
popular
tales
in
appeared
his
and
in
the
following
year
the
these
two
have
been
combined
and
published
as
a
second
edition
of
the
containing
fifty
florentine
and
milanese
tales
besides
a
number
of
stories
from
straparola
the
and
the
italian
novelists
given
by
way
of
illustration
the
stories
are
accompanied
by
copious
references
to
the
rest
of
italy
and
liebrecht
references
to
other
european
parallels
it
is
an
admirable
work
but
one
on
which
we
have
drawn
but
seldom
restricting
ourselves
to
the
stories
in
the
various
dialects
as
much
as
possible
the
milanese
stories
are
in
general
very
poor
versions
of
the
typical
tales
being
distorted
and
fragmentary
in
giuseppe
pitrè
of
palermo
well
known
for
his
collection
of
popular
sicilian
songs
published
three
specimens
of
a
collection
of
sicilian
popular
tales
and
two
years
later
gave
to
the
world
his
admirable
work
novelle
e
forming
vols
of
the
delle
tradizioni
populari
per
cura
di
giuseppe
pitrè
it
is
not
however
numerically
that
pitrè
collection
surpasses
all
that
has
previously
been
done
in
this
field
it
is
a
monument
of
patient
thorough
research
and
profound
study
its
arrangement
is
almost
faultless
the
explanatory
notes
full
while
the
grammar
and
glossary
constitute
valuable
contributions
to
the
philology
of
the
italian
dialects
in
the
introduction
the
author
probably
for
the
first
time
makes
the
sicilian
public
acquainted
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
comparative
mythology
and
its
relation
to
and
gives
a
good
account
of
the
oriental
sources
of
the
novel
he
has
it
seems
to
us
very
properly
confined
his
notes
and
comparisons
entirely
to
italy
with
references
of
course
to
gonzenbach
and
köhler
notes
to
when
necessary
in
other
words
his
work
is
a
contribution
to
and
the
student
of
comparative
aryan
must
make
his
own
comparisons
a
task
no
longer
difficult
thanks
to
the
works
of
grimm
hahn
köhler
cox
de
gubernatis
etc
the
only
other
collection
that
need
be
mentioned
here
is
the
one
in
the
e
racconti
del
popolo
consisting
of
the
first
volume
of
the
pop
pub
ed
da
dom
comparetti
and
of
visentini
the
stories
in
both
of
the
above
works
are
translated
into
italian
in
the
first
there
is
no
arrangement
by
locality
or
subject
and
the
annotations
instead
of
being
given
with
each
story
are
reserved
for
one
of
the
future
volumes
an
unhandy
arrangement
which
detracts
from
the
value
of
the
work
we
will
now
turn
our
attention
from
the
collections
themselves
to
the
stories
they
contain
and
examine
these
first
as
to
their
form
and
secondly
as
to
their
contents
the
name
applied
to
the
popular
tale
differs
in
various
provinces
being
generally
a
derivative
of
the
latin
so
these
stories
are
termed
and
in
parts
of
sicily
in
rome
in
venice
in
liguria
and
in
bologna
in
palermo
and
naples
they
are
named
and
in
tuscany
in
milan
and
in
piedmont
there
are
few
peculiarities
of
form
and
they
refer
almost
exclusively
to
the
beginning
and
ending
of
the
stories
those
from
sicily
begin
either
with
the
simple
there
was
or
vota
there
was
one
time
or
raccunta
vota
it
is
related
that
there
was
one
time
sometimes
the
formula
is
repeated
as
cunta
e
s
it
is
related
and
related
again
with
the
addition
at
times
of
lor
to
your
worships
or
the
story
about
to
be
told
is
qualified
as
bellissimu
this
very
fine
story
ordinarily
they
begin
as
do
our
own
with
the
formula
once
upon
a
time
there
was
the
ending
is
also
a
variable
formula
often
a
couplet
referring
to
the
happy
termination
of
the
tale
and
the
relatively
unenviable
condition
of
the
listeners
the
sicilian
ending
usually
is
iddi
arristaru
filici
e
cuntenti
e
nuàtri
semu
senza
nenti
they
remained
happy
and
contented
and
we
are
without
anything
the
last
line
often
is
nui
semu
ccà
munnamu
li
and
here
we
are
picking
our
teeth
or
a
nui
ni
dèsinu
but
to
us
they
gave
nothing
which
corresponds
to
a
tuscan
ending
se
ne
stettero
e
se
la
goderono
e
a
me
nulla
mi
diedero
they
stayed
and
enjoyed
it
and
gave
nothing
to
me
a
common
tuscan
ending
is
in
santa
pace
pia
dite
la
vostra
detto
la
mia
in
holy
pious
peace
tell
yours
for
i
have
told
mine
in
some
parts
of
sicily
polizzi
a
similar
conclusion
is
found
favula

ditta
diciti
la
vostra
ca
la
mia

story

curta
la
mia
conta
la
tua
chè
la
mia
xè
finìa
long
yours
short
mine
tell
yours
for
mine
is
ended
the
first
line
is
sometimes
as
follows
stretto
il
viuolo
stretta
la
via
dite
la
vostra
detto
la
mia
narrow
the
path
narrow
the
way
tell
yours
for
i
have
told
mine
the
most
common
form
of
the
above
tuscan
ending
is
stretta
è
la
foglia
è
larga
è
la
via
dite
la
vostra
chè
ho
detto
la
mia
narrow
is
the
leaf
broad
is
the
way
etc
this
same
ending
is
also
found
in
rome
these
endings
have
been
omitted
in
the
present
work
as
they
do
not
constitute
an
integral
part
of
the
story
and
are
often
left
off
by
the
narrators
themselves
the
narrative
is
usually
given
in
the
present
tense
and
in
most
of
the
collections
is
animated
and
dramatic
very
primitive
expedients
are
employed
to
indicate
the
lapse
of
time
either
the
verb
indicating
the
action
is
repeated
as
he
walked
and
walked
and
walked
a
proceeding
not
unknown
to
our
own
stories
or
such
expressions
as
the
following
are
used
porta
or
cuntu
metti
or
li
cunti
nun
which
are
all
equivalent
to
the
story
takes
no
note
of
time
these
sicilian
expressions
are
replaced
in
tuscany
by
the
similar
one
tempo
delle
novelle
passa
time
passes
quickly
in
stories
sometimes
the
narrator
will
bring
himself
or
herself
into
the
story
in
a
very
naive
manner
as
for
example
when
a
name
is
wanted
so
in
telling
a
sicilian
story
which
is
another
version
of
the
fair
angiola
given
in
our
text
the
narrator
gna
sabbedda
continues
the
old
woman
met
her
once
and
said
little
girl
whose
daughter
are
you
sabbedda
for
example
i
mention
myself
but
however
i
was
not
there
if
we
turn
our
attention
now
to
the
contents
of
our
stories
we
shall
find
that
they
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
of
the
rest
of
europe
and
the
same
story
is
found
with
trifling
variations
all
over
italy
there
is
but
little
local
coloring
in
the
fairy
tales
and
they
are
chiefly
interesting
for
purposes
of
comparison
we
have
given
in
our
text
such
a
copious
selection
from
all
parts
of
the
country
that
the
reader
can
easily
compare
them
for
himself
with
the
tales
of
other
lands
in
their
more
general
features
if
they
are
not
strikingly
original
they
will
still
we
trust
be
found
interesting
variations
of
familiar
themes
and
we
shall
perhaps
deem
less
strange
to
us
a
people
whose
children
are
still
amused
with
the
same
tales

popular
tales
chapter
i
fairy
tales
the
most
and
interesting
class
of
fairy
tales
is
the
one
in
which
a
wife
endeavors
to
behold
the
face
of
her
husband
who
comes
to
her
only
at
night
she
succeeds
but
her
husband
disappears
and
she
is
not
reunited
to
him
until
she
has
expiated
her
indiscretion
by
weary
journeys
and
the
performance
of
difficult
tasks
this
class
which
is
evidently
the
popular
form
of
the
classic
myth
of
cupid
and
psyche
may
for
convenience
be
divided
into
four
classes
the
first
turns
on
the
punishment
of
the
wife
curiosity
the
second
on
the
melusina
in
the
third
the
heroine
is
married
to
a
monster
is
separated
from
him
by
her
disobedience
but
finally
is
the
means
of
his
recovering
his
human
form
the
fourth
class
is
a
variant
of
the
first
and
third
the
husband
being
an
animal
in
form
and
parted
from
his
wife
by
the
curiosity
or
disobedience
of
the
latter
or
of
her
envious
sisters
to
illustrate
the
first
class
we
select
from
the
large
number
of
stories
before
us
a
sicilian
tale
pitrè
no
entitled
i
the
king
of
love
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
man
with
three
daughters
who
earned
his
living
by
gathering
wild
herbs
one
day
he
took
his
youngest
daughter
with
him
they
came
to
a
garden
and
began
to
gather
vegetables
the
daughter
saw
a
fine
radish
and
began
to
pull
it
up
when
suddenly
a
turk
appeared
and
said
why
have
you
opened
my
master
door
you
must
come
in
now
and
he
will
decide
on
your
punishment
they
went
down
into
the
ground
more
dead
than
alive
and
when
they
were
seated
they
saw
a
green
bird
come
in
and
bathe
in
a
pan
of
milk
then
dry
itself
and
become
a
handsome
youth
he
said
to
the
turk
what
do
these
persons
want
your
worship
they
pulled
up
a
radish
and
opened
the
door
of
the
cave
how
did
we
know
said
the
father
that
this
was
your
excellency
house
my
daughter
saw
a
fine
radish
it
pleased
her
and
she
pulled
it
up
well
if
that
the
case
said
the
master
your
daughter
shall
stay
here
as
my
wife
take
this
sack
of
gold
and
go
when
you
want
to
see
your
daughter
come
and
make
yourself
at
home
the
father
took
leave
of
his
daughter
and
went
away
when
the
master
was
alone
with
her
he
said
you
see
rosella
rusidda
you
are
now
mistress
here
and
gave
her
all
the
keys
she
was
perfectly
happy
literally
was
happy
to
the
hairs
of
her
head
one
day
while
the
green
bird
was
away
her
sisters
took
it
into
their
heads
to
visit
her
and
asked
her
about
her
husband
rosella
said
she
did
not
know
for
he
had
made
her
promise
not
to
try
to
find
out
who
he
was
her
sisters
however
persuaded
her
and
when
the
bird
returned
and
became
a
man
rosella
put
on
a
downcast
air
what
is
the
matter
asked
her
husband
nothing
you
had
better
tell
me
she
let
him
question
her
a
while
and
at
last
said
well
then
if
you
want
to
know
why
i
am
out
of
sorts
it
is
because
i
wish
to
know
your
name
her
husband
told
her
that
it
would
be
the
worse
for
her
but
she
insisted
on
knowing
his
name
so
he
made
her
put
the
gold
basins
on
a
chair
and
began
to
bathe
his
feet
rosella
do
you
really
want
to
know
my
name
yes
and
the
water
came
up
to
his
waist
for
he
had
become
a
bird
and
had
got
into
the
basin
then
he
asked
her
the
same
question
again
and
again
she
answered
yes
and
the
water
was
up
to
his
mouth
rosella
do
you
really
want
to
know
my
name
yes
yes
yes
then
know
that
i
am
called
the
king
of
love
and
saying
this
he
disappeared
and
the
basins
and
the
palace
disappeared
likewise
and
rosella
found
herself
alone
out
in
an
open
plain
without
a
soul
to
help
her
she
called
her
servants
but
no
one
answered
her
then
she
said
since
my
husband
has
disappeared
i
must
wander
about
alone
and
forlorn
to
seek
him
the
poor
woman
who
expected
before
long
to
become
a
mother
began
her
wanderings
and
at
night
arrived
at
another
lonely
plain
then
she
felt
her
heart
sink
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
she
cried
out
ah
king
of
love
you
did
it
and
said
it
you
disappeared
from
me
in
a
golden
basin
and
who
will
shelter
this
poor
unfortunate
one
when
she
had
uttered
these
words
an
ogress
appeared
and
said
ah
wretch
how
dare
you
go
about
seeking
my
nephew
and
was
going
to
eat
her
up
but
she
took
pity
on
her
miserable
state
and
gave
her
shelter
for
the
night
the
next
morning
she
gave
her
a
piece
of
bread
and
said
we
are
seven
sisters
all
ogresses
and
the
worst
of
all
is
your
look
out
for
her
to
be
brief
the
poor
girl
wandered
about
six
days
and
met
all
six
of
the
ogresses
who
treated
her
in
the
same
way
the
seventh
day
in
great
distress
she
uttered
her
usual
lament
and
the
sister
of
the
king
of
love
appeared
and
said
rosella
while
my
mother
is
out
come
up
and
she
lowered
the
braids
of
her
hair
and
pulled
her
up
then
she
gave
her
something
to
eat
and
told
her
how
to
seize
and
pinch
her
mother
until
she
cried
out

me
alone
for
the
sake
of
my
son
the
king
of
love

did
as
she
was
told
but
the
ogress
was
so
angry
she
was
going
to
eat
her
but
her
daughters
threatened
to
abandon
her
if
she
did
well
then
i
will
write
a
letter
and
rosella
must
carry
it
to
my
friend
poor
rosella
was
disheartened
when
she
saw
the
letter
and
descending
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
she
uttered
her
usual
complaint
when
the
king
of
love
appeared
and
said
you
see
your
curiosity
has
brought
you
to
this
point
poor
thing
when
she
saw
him
she
began
to
cry
and
begged
his
pardon
for
what
she
had
done
he
took
pity
on
her
and
said
now
listen
to
what
you
must
do
on
your
way
you
will
come
to
a
river
of
blood
you
must
bend
down
and
take
some
up
in
your
hands
and
say
beautiful
is
this
crystal
water

water
as
this
i
have
never
drunk
then
you
will
come
to
another
stream
of
turbid
water
and
do
the
same
there
then
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
garden
where
there
is
a
great
quantity
of
fruit

some
and
eat
it
saying
fine
pears
i
have
never
eaten
such
pears
as

will
come
to
an
oven
that
bakes
bread

and
night
and
no
one
buys
any
when
you
come
there
say
what
fine
bread
bread
like
this
i
have
never
eaten
and
eat
some
then
you
will
come
to
an
entrance
guarded
by
two
hungry
dogs
give
them
a
piece
of
bread
to
eat
then
you
will
come
to
a
doorway
all
dirty
and
full
of
cobwebs
take
a
broom
and
sweep
it
clean
up
the
stairs
you
will
find
two
giants
each
with
a
dirty
piece
of
meat
by
his
side

a
brush
and
clean
it
for
them

house

when
she
wants
to
make
you
enter

up
a
little
box
on
the
table
and
run
away
take
care
to
do
all
the
things
i
have
told
you
or
else
you
will
never
escape
alive
rosella
did
as
she
was
told
and
while
the
ogress
was
reading
the
letter
rosella
seized
the
box
and
ran
for
her
life
when
the
ogress
had
finished
reading
her
letter
she
called
rosella
rosella
when
she
received
no
answer
she
perceived
that
she
had
been
betrayed
and
cried
out
razor
scissors
knife
cut
her
in
pieces
they
answered
as
long
as
we
have
been
razor
scissors
and
knife
when
did
you
ever
deign
to
polish
us
rosella
came
and
brightened
us
up
the
ogress
enraged
exclaimed
stairs
swallow
her
up
as
long
as
i
have
been
stairs
when
did
you
ever
deign
to
sweep
me
rosella
came
and
swept
me
the
ogress
cried
in
a
passion
giants
crush
her
as
long
as
we
have
been
giants
when
did
you
ever
deign
to
clean
our
food
for
us
rosella
came
and
did
it
then
the
furious
ogress
called
on
the
entrance
to
bury
her
alive
the
dogs
to
devour
her
the
furnace
to
burn
her
the
to
fall
on
her
and
the
rivers
to
drown
her
but
they
all
remembered
kindness
and
refused
to
injure
her
meanwhile
rosella
continued
her
way
and
at
last
became
curious
to
know
what
was
in
the
box
she
was
carrying
so
she
opened
it
and
a
great
quantity
of
little
puppets
came
out
some
danced
some
sang
and
some
played
on
musical
instruments
she
amused
herself
some
time
with
them
but
when
she
was
ready
to
go
on
the
little
figures
would
not
return
to
the
box
night
approached
and
she
exclaimed
as
she
had
so
often
before
ah
king
of
love
etc
then
her
husband
appeared
and
said
oh
your
curiosity
will
be
the
death
of
you
and
commanded
the
puppets
to
enter
the
box
again
then
rosella
went
her
way
and
arrived
safely
at
her
when
the
ogress
saw
her
she
exclaimed
you
owe
this
luck
to
my
son
the
king
of
love
and
was
going
to
devour
poor
rosella
but
her
daughters
said
poor
child
she
has
brought
you
the
box
why
do
you
want
to
eat
her
well
and
good
you
want
to
marry
my
son
the
king
of
love
then
take
these
six
mattresses
and
go
and
fill
them
with
birds
feathers
rosella
descended
and
began
to
wander
about
uttering
her
usual
lament
when
her
husband
appeared
rosella
told
him
what
had
happened
he
whistled
and
the
king
of
the
birds
appeared
and
commanded
all
the
birds
to
come
and
drop
their
feathers
fill
the
six
beds
and
carry
them
back
to
the
ogress
who
again
said
that
her
son
had
helped
rosella
however
she
went
and
made
up
her
son
bed
with
the
six
mattresses
and
that
very
day
she
made
him
marry
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
portugal
then
she
called
rosella
and
telling
her
that
her
son
was
married
bade
her
kneel
before
the
nuptial
bed
holding
two
lighted
torches
rosella
obeyed
but
soon
the
king
of
love
under
the
plea
that
rosella
was
not
in
a
condition
to
hold
the
torches
any
longer
persuaded
his
bride
to
change
places
with
her
just
as
the
queen
took
the
torches
in
her
hands
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
her
up
and
the
king
remained
happy
with
rosella
when
the
ogress
heard
what
had
happened
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
head
and
declared
that
rosella
child
should
not
be
born
until
she
unclasped
her
hands
then
the
king
of
love
had
a
catafalque
erected
and
stretched
himself
on
it
as
though
he
were
dead
and
had
all
the
bells
tolled
and
made
the
people
cry
how
did
the
king
of
love
die
the
ogress
heard
it
and
asked
what
is
that
noise
her
daughters
told
her
that
their
brother
was
dead
from
her
fault
when
the
ogress
heard
this
she
unclasped
her
hands
saying
how
did
my
son
die
at
that
moment
rosella
child
was
born
when
the
ogress
heard
it
she
burst
a
in
her
heart
and
died
then
the
king
of
love
took
his
wife
and
sisters
and
they
remained
happy
and
contented
there
is
another
version
of
this
story
in
pitrè
no
entitled
the
crystal
king
which
resembles
more
closely
the
classic
myth
a
father
marries
the
youngest
of
his
three
daughters
to
a
cavalier
the
enchanted
son
of
a
king
who
comes
to
his
wife
at
night
only
the
cavalier
once
permits
his
wife
to
visit
her
sisters
and
they
learn
from
her
that
she
has
never
seen
her
husband
face
the
eldest
gives
her
a
wax
candle
and
tells
her
to
light
it
when
her
husband
is
asleep
and
then
she
can
see
him
and
tell
them
what
he
is
like
she
did
so
and
beheld
at
her
side
a
handsome
youth
but
while
she
was
gazing
at
him
some
of
the
melted
wax
fell
on
his
nose
he
awoke
crying
treason
treason
and
drove
his
wife
from
the
house
on
her
wanderings
she
meets
a
hermit
and
tells
him
her
story
he
advises
her
to
have
made
a
pair
of
iron
shoes
and
when
she
has
worn
them
out
in
her
travels
she
will
come
to
a
palace
where
they
will
give
her
shelter
and
where
she
will
find
her
husband
the
remainder
of
the
story
is
of
no
interest
here
in
the
second
class
of
stories
belonging
to
this
myth
it
is
the
curiosity
of
the
husband
which
is
punished
the
best
known
example
of
this
class
out
of
italy
being
the
beautiful
french
legend
of
melusina
a
sicilian
story
in
gonzenbach
no
the
story
of
the
merchant
son
peppino
is
a
very
close
counterpart
of
the
king
of
love
above
given
peppino
is
wrecked
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
the
rock
opens
fair
maidens
come
out
and
conduct
peppino
to
a
beautiful
castle
in
the
cave
there
a
maiden
visits
him
at
night
only
after
a
time
peppino
wishes
to
see
his
parents
and
his
wife
allows
him
to
depart
with
the
promise
to
return
at
a
certain
date
his
parents
after
hearing
his
story
give
him
a
candle
with
which
to
see
his
wife
everything
happens
as
in
the
first
story
the
castle
disappears
and
peppino
finds
himself
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
he
recovers
his
wife
only
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
and
the
accomplishment
of
many
difficult
tasks
the
third
class
generally
known
by
the
title
of
beauty
and
the
beast
is
best
represented
by
a
story
from
montale
near
pistoja
called
ii
zelinda
and
the
monster
there
was
once
a
poor
man
who
had
three
daughters
and
as
the
youngest
was
the
fairest
and
most
civil
and
had
the
best
disposition
her
other
two
sisters
envied
her
with
a
deadly
envy
although
her
father
on
the
contrary
loved
her
dearly
it
happened
that
in
a
neighboring
town
in
the
month
of
january
there
was
a
great
fair
and
that
poor
man
was
obliged
to
go
there
to
lay
in
the
provisions
necessary
for
the
support
of
his
family
and
before
departing
he
asked
his
three
daughters
if
they
would
like
some
small
presents
in
proportion
you
understand
to
his
means
rosina
wished
a
dress
marietta
asked
him
for
a
shawl
but
zelinda
was
satisfied
with
a
handsome
rose
the
poor
man
set
out
on
his
journey
early
the
next
day
and
when
he
arrived
at
the
fair
quickly
bought
what
he
needed
and
afterward
easily
found
rosina
dress
and
marietta
shawl
but
at
that
season
he
could
not
find
a
rose
for
his
zelinda
although
he
took
great
pains
in
looking
everywhere
for
one
however
anxious
to
please
his
dear
zelinda
he
took
the
first
road
he
came
to
and
after
journeying
a
while
arrived
at
a
handsome
garden
inclosed
by
high
walls
but
as
the
gate
was
partly
open
he
entered
softly
he
found
the
garden
filled
with
every
kind
of
flowers
and
plants
and
in
a
corner
was
a
tall
full
of
beautiful
wherever
he
looked
no
living
soul
appeared
from
whom
he
might
ask
a
rose
as
a
gift
or
for
money
so
the
poor
man
without
thinking
stretched
out
his
hand
and
picked
a
rose
for
his
zelinda
mercy
scarcely
had
he
pulled
the
flower
from
the
stalk
when
there
arose
a
great
noise
and
flames
darted
from
the
earth
and
all
at
once
there
appeared
a
terrible
monster
with
the
figure
of
a
dragon
and
hissed
with
all
his
might
and
cried
out
enraged
at
that
poor
christian
rash
man
what
have
you
done
now
you
must
die
at
once
for
you
have
had
the
audacity
to
touch
and
destroy
my
the
poor
man
more
than
half
dead
with
terror
began
to
weep
and
beg
for
mercy
on
his
knees
asking
pardon
for
the
fault
he
had
committed
and
told
why
he
had
picked
the
rose
and
then
he
added
let
me
depart
i
have
a
family
and
if
i
am
killed
they
will
go
to
destruction
but
the
monster
more
wicked
than
ever
responded
listen
one
must
die
either
bring
me
the
girl
that
asked
for
the
rose
or
i
will
kill
you
this
very
moment
it
was
impossible
to
move
him
by
prayers
or
lamentations
the
monster
persisted
in
his
decision
and
did
not
let
the
poor
man
go
until
he
had
sworn
to
bring
him
there
in
the
garden
his
daughter
zelinda
imagine
how
downhearted
that
poor
man
returned
home
he
gave
his
oldest
daughters
their
presents
and
zelinda
her
rose
but
his
face
was
distorted
and
as
white
as
though
he
had
arisen
from
the
dead
so
that
the
girls
in
terror
asked
him
what
had
happened
and
whether
he
had
met
with
any
misfortune
they
were
urgent
and
at
last
the
poor
man
weeping
bitterly
related
the
misfortunes
of
that
unhappy
journey
and
on
what
condition
he
had
been
able
finally
to
return
home
in
short
he
exclaimed
either
zelinda
or
i
must
be
eaten
alive
by
the
monster
then
the
two
sisters
emptied
the
vials
of
their
wrath
on
zelinda
just
see
they
said
that
affected
capricious
girl
she
shall
go
to
the
monster
she
who
wanted
roses
at
this
season
no
indeed
papa
must
stay
with
us
the
stupid
creature
at
all
these
taunts
zelinda
without
growing
angry
simply
said
it
is
right
that
the
one
who
has
caused
the
misfortune
should
pay
for
it
i
will
go
to
the
monster
yes
papa
take
me
to
the
garden
and
the
lord
will
be
done
the
next
day
zelinda
and
her
sorrowful
father
began
their
journey
and
at
nightfall
arrived
at
the
garden
gate
when
they
entered
they
saw
as
usual
no
one
but
they
beheld
a
lordly
palace
all
lighted
and
the
doors
wide
open
when
the
two
travellers
entered
the
vestibule
suddenly
four
marble
statues
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
descended
from
their
pedestals
and
accompanied
them
up
the
stairs
to
a
large
hall
where
a
table
was
lavishly
spread
the
travellers
who
were
very
hungry
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
without
ceremony
and
when
they
had
finished
the
same
statues
conducted
them
to
two
handsome
chambers
for
the
night
zelinda
and
her
father
were
so
weary
that
they
slept
like
dormice
all
night
at
daybreak
zelinda
and
her
father
arose
and
were
served
with
everything
for
breakfast
by
invisible
hands
then
they
descended
to
the
garden
and
began
to
seek
the
monster
when
they
came
to
the
he
appeared
in
all
his
frightful
ugliness
zelinda
on
seeing
him
became
pale
with
fear
and
her
limbs
trembled
but
the
monster
regarded
her
attentively
with
his
great
fiery
eyes
and
afterward
said
to
the
poor
man
very
well
you
have
kept
your
word
and
i
am
satisfied
now
depart
and
leave
me
alone
here
with
the
young
girl
at
this
command
the
old
man
thought
he
should
die
and
zelinda
too
stood
there
half
stupefied
and
her
eyes
full
of
tears
but
entreaties
were
of
no
avail
the
monster
remained
as
obdurate
as
a
stone
and
the
poor
man
was
obliged
to
depart
leaving
his
dear
zelinda
in
the
monster
power
when
the
monster
was
alone
with
zelinda
he
began
to
caress
her
and
make
loving
speeches
to
her
and
managed
to
appear
quite
civil
there
was
no
danger
of
his
forgetting
her
and
he
saw
that
she
wanted
nothing
and
every
day
talking
with
her
in
the
garden
he
asked
her
do
you
love
me
zelinda
will
you
be
my
wife
the
young
girl
always
answered
him
in
the
same
way
i
like
you
sir
but
i
will
never
be
your
wife
then
the
monster
appeared
very
sorrowful
and
redoubled
his
caresses
and
attentions
and
sighing
deeply
said
but
you
see
zelinda
if
you
should
marry
me
wonderful
things
would
happen
what
they
are
i
can
not
tell
you
until
you
will
be
my
wife
zelinda
although
in
her
heart
not
dissatisfied
with
that
beautiful
place
and
with
being
treated
like
a
queen
still
did
not
feel
at
all
like
marrying
the
monster
because
he
was
too
ugly
and
looked
like
a
beast
and
always
answered
his
requests
in
the
same
manner
one
day
however
the
monster
called
zelinda
in
haste
and
said
listen
zelinda
if
you
do
not
consent
to
marry
me
it
is
fated
that
your
father
must
die
he
is
ill
and
near
the
end
of
his
life
and
you
will
not
be
able
even
to
see
him
again
see
whether
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
and
drawing
out
an
enchanted
mirror
the
monster
showed
zelinda
her
father
on
his
at
that
spectacle
zelinda
in
despair
and
half
mad
with
grief
cried
oh
save
my
father
for
mercy
sake

me
be
able
to
embrace
him
once
more
before
he
dies
yes
yes
i
promise
you
i
will
be
your
faithful
and
constant
wife
and
that
without
delay
but
save
my
father
from
death
scarcely
had
zelinda
uttered
these
words
when
suddenly
the
monster
was
transformed
into
a
very
handsome
youth
zelinda
was
astounded
by
this
unexpected
change
and
the
young
man
took
her
by
the
hand
and
said
know
dear
zelinda
that
i
am
the
son
of
the
king
of
the
oranges
an
old
witch
touching
me
changed
me
into
the
terrible
monster
i
was
and
condemned
me
to
be
hidden
in
this
until
a
beautiful
girl
consented
to
become
my
wife
the
remainder
of
the
story
has
no
interest
here
zelinda
and
her
husband
strive
to
obtain
his
parents
consent
to
his
marriage
they
refuse
and
the
young
couple
run
away
from
the
royal
palace
and
fall
into
the
power
of
an
ogre
and
his
wife
from
whom
they
at
last
escape
a
characteristic
trait
of
this
class
of
stories
is
omitted
in
the
above
version
but
found
in
a
number
of
others
in
a
sicilian
version
pitrè
no
the
empress
rosina
the
monster
permits
rosina
to
visit
her
family
but
warns
her
that
if
she
does
not
return
at
the
end
of
nine
days
he
will
die
he
gives
her
a
ring
the
stone
of
which
will
grow
black
in
that
event
the
nine
days
pass
unheeded
and
when
rosina
looks
at
her
ring
it
is
as
black
as
pitch
she
returns
in
haste
and
finds
the
monster
writhing
in
the
last
agony
under
the
four
days
she
rubbed
him
with
some
ointment
she
found
in
the
palace
and
the
monster
recovered
as
in
the
last
story
he
resumes
his
shape
when
rosina
consents
to
marry
him
in
one
of
pitrè
variants
the
monster
allows
elizabeth
to
visit
her
dying
father
if
she
will
promise
not
to
tear
her
hair
when
her
father
dies
she
forgets
in
her
grief
her
promise
and
tears
out
her
hair
when
she
returns
to
the
palace
the
monster
has
disappeared
she
seeks
him
exclaiming
fierce
animal
mine
if
i
find
thee
alive
i
will
marry
thee
although
an
animal
she
finds
him
at
last
and
he
resumes
his
form
the
fourth
class
consists
of
stories
more
or
less
distantly
connected
with
the
first
and
third
classes
above
mentioned
and
which
turn
on
the
heroine
separation
from
and
search
after
her
lost
husband
usually
an
animal
in
form
the
example
we
have
selected
from
this
class
is
from
venice
bernoni
xvii
and
is
as
follows
iii
king
bean
there
was
once
an
old
man
who
had
three
daughters
one
day
the
youngest
called
her
father
into
her
room
and
requested
him
to
go
to
king
bean
and
ask
him
whether
he
wished
her
for
his
wife
the
poor
old
man
said
you
want
me
to
go
but
what
shall
i
do
i
have
never
been
there
no
matter
she
answered
i
wish
you
to
obey
me
and
go
then
he
started
on
his
way
and
asked
for
he
did
not
know
where
the
king
lived
and
they
pointed
out
the
palace
to
him
when
he
was
in
the
king
presence
he
said
your
majesty
servant
the
king
replied
what
do
you
want
of
me
my
good
old
man
then
he
told
him
that
his
daughter
was
in
love
with
him
and
wanted
to
marry
him
the
king
answered
how
can
she
be
in
love
with
me
when
she
has
never
seen
or
known
me
she
is
killing
herself
with
weeping
and
can
not
stand
it
much
longer
the
king
replied
here
is
a
white
handkerchief
let
her
dry
her
tears
with
it
the
old
man
took
back
the
handkerchief
and
the
message
to
his
daughter
who
said
well
after
three
or
four
days
you
must
go
back
again
and
tell
him
that
i
will
kill
myself
or
hang
myself
if
he
will
not
marry
me
the
old
man
went
back
and
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
do
me
the
favor
to
marry
my
daughter
if
not
she
will
make
a
great
spectacle
of
herself
the
king
replied
behold
how
many
handsome
portraits
i
have
here
and
how
many
beautiful
young
girls
i
have
and
not
one
of
them
suits
me
the
old
man
said
she
told
me
also
to
say
to
you
that
if
you
did
not
marry
her
she
would
kill
herself
or
hang
herself
then
the
king
gave
him
a
knife
and
a
rope
and
said
here
is
a
knife
if
she
wants
to
kill
herself
and
here
is
a
rope
if
she
wants
to
hang
herself
the
old
man
bore
this
message
back
to
his
daughter
who
told
her
father
that
he
must
go
back
to
the
king
again
and
not
leave
him
until
he
obtained
his
consent
the
old
man
returned
once
more
and
falling
on
his
knees
before
the
king
said
do
me
this
great
favor
take
my
daughter
for
your
wife
do
not
say
no
for
the
poor
girl
is
beside
herself
the
king
answered
rise
good
old
man
and
i
will
consent
for
i
am
sorry
for
your
long
journeys
but
hear
what
your
daughter
must
do
first
she
must
prepare
three
vessels
one
of
milk
and
water
one
of
milk
and
one
of
and
here
is
a
bean
when
she
wants
to
speak
with
me
let
her
go
out
on
the
balcony
and
open
the
bean
and
i
will
come
the
old
man
returned
home
this
time
more
satisfied
and
told
his
daughter
what
she
must
do
she
prepared
the
three
vessels
as
directed
and
then
opened
the
bean
on
the
balcony
and
saw
at
once
something
flying
from
a
distance
towards
her
it
flew
into
the
room
by
the
balcony
and
entered
the
vessel
of
water
and
milk
to
bathe
then
it
hastened
into
the
vessel
of
milk
and
finally
into
that
containing
the
and
then
there
came
out
the
handsomest
youth
that
was
ever
seen
and
made
love
to
the
young
girl
afterward
when
they
were
tired
of
their
he
bade
her
and
flew
away
after
a
time
when
her
sisters
saw
that
she
was
always
shut
up
in
her
room
the
oldest
said
why
does
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
all
the
time
the
other
sister
replied
because
she
has
king
bean
who
is
making
love
to
her
the
oldest
said
wait
until
she
goes
to
church
and
then
we
will
see
what
there
is
in
her
room
one
day
the
youngest
locked
her
door
and
went
to
church
then
the
two
sisters
broke
open
the
door
and
saw
the
three
vessels
prepared
and
said
this
is
the
vessel
in
which
the
king
goes
to
bathe
the
oldest
said
let
us
go
down
into
the
store
and
get
some
broken
glass
and
put
a
little
in
each
of
the
three
vessels
and
when
the
king
bathes
in
them
the
glass
will
pierce
him
and
cut
all
his
body
they
did
so
and
then
left
the
room
looking
as
it
did
first
when
the
youngest
sister
returned
she
went
to
her
room
and
wished
to
talk
with
her
husband
she
opened
the
balcony
and
then
she
opened
the
bean
and
saw
at
once
her
husband
come
flying
from
a
distance
with
his
arms
open
to
embrace
her
he
flew
on
to
the
balcony
and
threw
himself
into
the
vessel
of
milk
and
water
and
the
pieces
of
glass
pierced
his
body
then
he
entered
the
vessel
of
milk
and
that
of
and
his
body
was
filled
with
the
fragments
of
glass
when
he
came
out
of
the
he
flew
away
then
his
wife
hastened
out
on
the
balcony
and
saw
a
streak
of
blood
wherever
he
had
flown
then
she
looked
into
the
vessels
and
saw
all
three
full
of
blood
and
cried
i
have
been
betrayed
i
have
been
betrayed
she
called
her
father
and
told
him
that
she
had
been
betrayed
by
her
sisters
and
that
she
wished
to
go
away
and
see
whether
she
could
cure
her
husband
she
departed
and
had
not
gone
far
when
she
found
herself
in
a
forest
there
she
saw
a
little
house
with
a
little
bit
of
a
door
at
which
she
knocked
and
heard
a
voice
saying
are
you
christians
she
replied
yes
then
the
door
opened
and
she
saw
a
holy
hermit
who
said
blessed
one
how
did
you
get
here
in
a
moment
the
witches
will
come
who
might
bewitch
you
she
replied
father

is
the
hermit
said
i

nothing
about
him
climb
that
tree
the
witches
will
soon
come
and
you
will
learn
something
from
them
if
you
want
anything
afterward
come
to
me
and
i
will
give
it
to
you
when
she
was
up
the
tree
she
heard
a
loud
noise
and
the
words
here
we
are
here
we
are
and
all
the
witches
run
and
seat
themselves
on
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
and
begin
to
say
the
cripple
is
not
here
where
has
that
cursed
cripple
gone
some
one
answered
here
she
is
coming
another
said
you
cursed
cripple
where
have
you
been
the
cripple
answered
be
still
i
will
tell
you
now
but
wait
a
moment
until
i
shake
this
tree
to
see
whether
there
is
any
one
in
it
the
poor
girl
held
on
firmly
so
as
not
to
fall
down
after
she
had
shaken
it
this
cripple
said
to
her
companions
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
something
king
bean
has
only
two
hours
to
live
another
witch
said
what
is
the
matter
with
him
the
cripple
answered
he
had
a
wife
and
she
put
some
broken
glass
in
the
three
vessels
and
he
filled
his
body
with
it
another
witch
asked
is
there
nothing
that
can
cure
him
the
cripple
replied
it
is
very
difficult
another
said
what
would
be
necessary
the
cripple
said
listen
to
what
it
needs
one
of
us
must
be
killed
and
her
blood
put
in
a
kettle
and
have
added
to
it
the
blood
of
one
of
these
doves
flying
about
here
when
this
blood
is
well
mixed
it
must
be
heated
and
with
this
blood
the
whole
body
of
the
king
must
be
anointed
another
thing
yet
is
necessary
under
the
stone
you
see
there
is
a
flask
of
water
the
stone
must
be
removed
a
bottle
of
the
water
must
be
poured
over
the
king
and
all
the
bits
of
glass
will
come
out
of
him
and
in
five
minutes
he
will
be
safe
and
sound
then
the
witches
ate
and
drank
until
they
were
intoxicated
and
tired
and
then
threw
themselves
down
on
the
ground
to
sleep
when
the
young
girl
saw
that
they
were
asleep
she
descended
quietly
from
the
tree
knocked
at
the
hermit
door
told
him
what
the
witches
had
said
and
asked
him
for
a
kettle
knife
and
bottle
he
gave
them
to
her
and
caught
a
dove
which
he
killed
bled
and
put
the
blood
in
a
kettle
the
young
girl
did
not
know
which
one
of
the
witches
to
kill
but
finally
she
decided
to
kill
the
cripple
who
had
spoken
and
put
her
blood
in
the
kettle
afterward
she
lifted
the
stone
found
the
flask
of
water
and
filled
her
bottle
with
it
she
then
returned
to
the
hermit
and
told
him
all
she
had
done
he
gave
her
a
physician
dress
which
she
put
on
and
went
to
the
palace
of
king
bean
there
she
asked
the
guards
to
let
her
pass
for
she
was
going
she
said
to
see
about
curing
the
king
the
guards
refused
at
first
but
seeing
her
so
confident
allowed
her
to
enter
the
king
mother
went
to
her
at
once
and
said
my
good
physician
if
you
can
cure
my
son
you
shall
mount
the
throne
and
i
will
give
you
my
crown
i
have
come
in
haste
from
a
distance
said
the
physician
and
will
cure
him
then
the
physician
went
to
the
kitchen
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
afterward
entered
the
room
of
the
king
who
had
but
a
few
minutes
to
live
anointed
his
whole
body
with
the
blood
and
then
poured
the
bottle
of
water
all
over
him
then
the
glass
came
out
of
his
body
and
in
five
minutes
he
was
safe
and
sound
the
king
said
here
physician

my
crown
i
wish
to
put
it
on
your
head
the
physician
answered
how
did
your
majesty
come
to
have
this
slight
trouble
the
king
said
on
account
of
my
wife
i
went
to
make
love
to
her
and
she
prepared
for
me
three
vessels
of
water
and
milk
of
milk
and
of
and
put
broken
glass
in
them
so
that
i
had
my
body
full
of
it
said
the
physician
see
whether
it
was
your
wife
who
worked
you
this
treason
could
it
not
have
been
some
one
else
that
is
impossible
said
the
king
for
no
one
entered
her
room
and
what
would
you
do
said
the
physician
if
you
had
her
now
in
your
hands
i
would
kill
her
with
a
knife
you
are
right
said
the
physician
because
if
it
is
true
that
she
has
acted
thus
she
deserves
nothing
but
death
then
the
physician
said
he
must
depart
but
the
king
mother
said
no

never
be
said
that
after
saving
my
son

of
the
promise

the
palm
of
one
of
my
hands
my
name
and
surname
and
on
the
other
his
name
and
surname
the
king
did
so
and
the
physician
said
now
i
am
going
to
make
some
visits
then
i
will
return
instead
of
returning
the
pretended
physician
went
to
her
own
home
and
threw
away
the
water
and
milk
in
the
three
vessels
and
put
in
other
pure
water
and
milk
and
then
she
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
opened
the
bean
the
king
who
felt
his
heart
opened
seized
his
dagger
and
hastened
to
his
wife
to
kill
her
when
she
saw
the
dagger
she
raised
her
hands
and
the
king
beheld
his
name
and
hers
then
he
threw
his
dagger
away
bathed
in
the
three
vessels
and
then
threw
his
arms
about
his
wife
neck
and
exclaimed
if
you
are
the
one
who
did
me
so
much
harm
you
are
also
the
one
who
cured
me
she
answered
it
was
not
i
was
betrayed
by
my
sisters
if
that
is
so
said
he
come
at
once
to
my
parents
house
and
we
will
be
married
there
when
she
arrived
at
the
king
palace
she
related
everything
to
his
parents
and
showed
them
her
hands
with
her
name
and
surname
then
the
parents
embraced
her
and
gave
her
a
wedding
and
she
and
the
king
loved
each
other
as
long
as
they
lived
the
next
class
to
which
we
shall
direct
our
attention
is
the
one
in
which
jealous
relatives
usually
envious
sisters
or
steal
a
mother
children
who
are
exposed
and
afterwards
rescued
and
brought
up
far
from
their
home
by
some
childless
person
or
the
mother
is
accused
of
having
devoured
them
and
is
repudiated
or
punished
and
finally
delivered
and
restored
to
her
former
position
by
her
children
who
are
discovered
by
their
father
the
following
story
belonging
to
this
class
is
from
pitrè
no
slightly
condensed
iv
the
dancing
water
the
singing
apple
and
the
speaking
bird
there
was
once
an
who
had
three
daughters
who
earned
their
living
by
spinning
one
day
their
father
died
and
left
them
all
alone
in
the
world
now
the
king
had
a
habit
of
going
about
the
streets
at
night
and
listening
at
the
doors
to
hear
what
the
people
said
of
him
one
night
he
listened
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
three
sisters
lived
and
heard
them
disputing
about
something
the

straightway
he
married

soon
the
two

began
to
be
envious
of
the
youngest
look
said
they
she
is
going
to
be
queen
and
we
must
be
servants
and
they
began
to
hate
her
a
few
months
before
the
queen
children
were
to
be
born
the
king
declared
war
and
was
obliged
to
depart
but
he
left
word
that
if
the
queen
had
three
children
two
sons
with
apples
in
their
hands
and
a
girl
with
a
star
on
her
brow
the
mother
was
to
be
respected
as
queen
if
not
he
was
to
be
informed
of
it
and
would
tell
his
servants
what
to
do
then
he
departed
for
the
war
when
the
queen
children
were
born
as
she
had
promised
the
envious
sisters
bribed
the
nurse
to
put
little
dogs
in
the
place
of
the
children
and
sent
word
to
the
king
that
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
three
puppies
he
wrote
back
that
she
should
be
taken
care
of
for
two
weeks
and
then
put
into
a
meanwhile
the
nurse
took
the
little
babies
and
carried
them
out
of
doors
saying
i
will
make
the
dogs
eat
them
up
and
she
left
them
alone
while
they
were
thus
exposed
three
fairies
passed
by
and
exclaimed
oh
how
beautiful
these
children
are
and
one
of
the
fairies
said
what
present
shall
we
make
these
children
one
answered
i
will
give
them
a
deer
to
nurse
them
and
i
a
purse
always
full
of
money
and
i
said
the
third
fairy
will
give
them
a
ring
which
will
change
color
when
any
misfortune
happens
to
one
of
them
the
deer
nursed
and
took
care
of
the
children
until
they
grew
up
then
the
fairy
who
had
given
them
the
deer
came
and
said
now
that
you
have
grown
up
how
can
you
stay
here
any
longer
very
well
said
one
of
the
brothers
i
will
go
to
the
city
and
hire
a
house
take
care
said
the
deer
that
you
hire
one
opposite
the
royal
palace
so
they
all
went
to
the
city
and
hired
a
palace
as
directed
and
furnished
it
as
if
they
had
been
royal
personages
when
the
aunts
saw
these
three
youths
imagine
their
terror
they
are
alive
they
said
they
could
not
be
mistaken
for
there
were
the
apples
in
their
hands
and
the
star
on
the
girl
brow
they
called
the
nurse
and
said
to
her
nurse
what
does
this
mean
are
our
nephews
and
niece
alive
the
nurse
watched
at
the
window
until
she
saw
the
two
brothers
go
out
and
then
she
went
over
as
if
to
make
a
visit
to
the
new
house
she
entered
and
said
what
is
the
matter
my
daughter
how
do
you
do
are
you
perfectly
happy
you
lack
nothing
but
do
you
know
what
is
necessary
to
make
you
really
happy
it
is
the
dancing
water
if
your
brothers
love
you
they
will
get
it
for
you
she
remained
a
moment
longer
and
then
departed
when
one
of
the
brothers
returned
his
sister
said
to
him
ah
my
brother
if
you
love
me
go
and
get
me
the
dancing
water
he
consented
and
next
morning
saddled
a
fine
horse
and
departed
on
his
way
he
met
a
hermit
who
asked
him
where
are
you
going
cavalier
i
am
going
for
the
dancing
water
you
are
going
to
your
death
my
son
but
keep
on
until
you
find
a
hermit
older
than
i
he
continued
his
journey
until
he
met
another
hermit
who
asked
him
the
same
question
and
gave
him
the
same
direction
finally
he
met
a
third
hermit
older
than
the
other
two
with
a
white
beard
that
came
down
to
his
feet
who
gave
him
the
following
directions
you
must
climb
yonder
mountain
on
top
of
it
you
will
find
a
great
plain
and
a
house
with
a
beautiful
gate
before
the
gate
you
will
see
four
giants
with
swords
in
their
hands
take
heed
do
not
make
a
mistake
for
if
you
do
that
is
the
end
of
you
when
the
giants
have
their
eyes
closed
do
not
enter
when
they
have
their
eyes
open
enter
then
you
will
come
to
a
door
if
you
find
it
open
do
not
enter
if
you
find
it
shut
push
it
open
and
enter
then
you
will
find
four
lions
when
they
have
their
eyes
shut
do
not
enter
when
their
eyes
are
open
enter
and
you
will
see
the
dancing
water
the
youth
took
leave
of
the
hermit
and
hastened
on
his
way
meanwhile
the
sister
kept
looking
at
the
ring
constantly
to
see
whether
the
stone
in
it
changed
color
but
as
it
did
not
she
remained
undisturbed
a
few
days
after
leaving
the
hermit
the
youth
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
saw
the
palace
with
the
four
giants
before
it
they
had
their
eyes
shut
and
the
door
was
open
no
said
the
youth
that
wo
do
and
so
he
remained
on
the
lookout
a
while
when
the
giants
opened
their
eyes
and
the
door
closed
he
entered
waited
until
the
lions
opened
their
eyes
and
passed
in
there
he
found
the
dancing
water
and
filled
his
bottles
with
it
and
escaped
when
the
lions
again
opened
their
eyes
the
aunts
meanwhile
were
delighted
because
their
nephew
did
not
return
but
in
a
few
days
he
appeared
and
embraced
his
sister
then
they
had
two
golden
basins
made
and
put
into
them
the
dancing
water
which
leaped
from
one
basin
to
the
other
when
the
aunts
saw
it
they
exclaimed
ah
how
did
he
manage
to
get
that
water
and
called
the
nurse
who
again
waited
until
the
sister
was
alone
and
then
visited
her
you
see
said
she
how
beautiful
the
dancing
water
is
but
do
you
know
what
you
want
now
the
singing
apple
then
she
departed
when
the
brother
who
had
brought
the
dancing
water
returned
his
sister
said
to
him
if
you
love
me
you
must
get
for
me
the
singing
apple
yes
my
sister
i
will
go
and
get
it
next
morning
he
mounted
his
horse
and
set
out
after
a
time
he
met
the
first
hermit
who
sent
him
to
an
older
one
he
asked
the
youth
where
he
was
going
and
said
it
is
a
difficult
task
to
get
the
singing
apple
but
hear
what
you
must
do
climb
the
mountain
beware
of
the
giants
the
door
and
the
lions
then
you
will
find
a
little
door
and
a
pair
of
shears
in
it
if
the
shears
are
open
enter
if
closed
do
not
risk
it
the
youth
continued
his
way
found
the
palace
entered
and
found
everything
favorable
when
he
saw
the
shears
open
he
went
in
a
room
and
saw
a
wonderful
tree
on
top
of
which
was
an
apple
he
climbed
up
and
tried
to
pick
the
apple
but
the
top
of
the
tree
swayed
now
this
way
now
that
he
waited
until
it
was
still
a
moment
seized
the
branch
and
picked
the
apple
he
succeeded
in
getting
safely
out
of
the
palace
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
home
and
all
the
time
he
was
carrying
the
apple
it
kept
making
a
sound
the
aunts
were
again
delighted
because
their
nephew
was
so
long
absent
but
when
they
saw
him
return
they
felt
as
though
the
house
had
fallen
on
them
again
they
summoned
the
nurse
and
again
she
visited
the
young
girl
and
said
see
how
beautiful
they
are
the
dancing
water
and
the
singing
apple
but
should
you
see
the
speaking
bird
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
you
to
see
very
well
said
the
young
girl
we
will
see
whether
my
brother
will
get
it
for
me
when
her
brother
came
she
asked
him
for
the
speaking
bird
and
he
promised
to
get
it
for
her
he
met
as
usual
on
his
journey
the
first
hermit
who
sent
him
to
the
second
who
sent
him
on
to
a
third
one
who
said
to
him
climb
the
mountain
and
enter
the
palace
you
will
find
many
statues
then
you
will
come
to
a
garden
in
the
midst
of
which
is
a
fountain
and
on
the
basin
is
the
speaking
bird
if
it
should
say
anything
to
you
do
not
answer
pick
a
feather
from
the
bird
wing
dip
it
into
a
jar
you
will
find
there
and
anoint
all
the
statues
keep
your
eyes
open
and
all
will
go
well
the
youth
already
knew
well
the
way
and
soon
was
in
the
palace
he
found
the
garden
and
the
bird
which
as
soon
as
it
saw
him
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
noble
sir
have
you
come
for
me
you
have
missed
it
your
aunts
have
sent
you
to
your
death
and
you
must
remain
here
your
mother
has
been
sent
to
the
my
mother
in
the
cried
the
youth
and
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
became
a
statue
like
all
the
others
when
the
sister
looked
at
her
ring
she
saw
that
it
had
changed
its
color
to
blue
ah
she
exclaimed
and
sent
her
other
brother
after
the
first
everything
happened
to
him
as
to
the
first
he
met
the
three
hermits
received
his
instructions
and
soon
found
himself
in
the
palace
where
he
discovered
the
garden
with
the
statues
the
fountain
and
the
speaking
bird
meanwhile
the
aunts
who
saw
that
both
their
nephews
were
missing
were
delighted
and
the
sister
on
looking
at
her
ring
saw
that
it
had
become
clear
again
now
when
the
speaking
bird
saw
the
youth
appear
in
the
garden
it
said
to
him
what
has
become
of
your
brother
your
mother
has
been
sent
to
the
alas
my
mother
in
the
and
when
he
had
spoken
these
words
he
became
a
statue
the
sister
looked
at
her
ring
and
it
had
become
black
poor
child
not
having
anything
else
to
do
she
dressed
herself
like
a
page
and
set
out
like
her
brothers
she
met
the
three
hermits
and
received
their
instructions
the
third
concluded
thus
beware
for
if
you
answer
when
the
bird
speaks
you
will
lose
your
life
she
continued
her
way
followed
exactly
the
hermit
directions
and
reached
the
garden
in
safety
when
the
bird
saw
her
it
exclaimed
ah
you
here
too
now
you
will
meet
the
same
fate
as
your
brothers
do
you
see
them
one
two
and
you
make
three
your
father
is
at
the
war
your
mother
is
in
the
your
aunts
are
rejoicing
she
did
not
reply
but
let
the
bird
sing
on
when
it
had
nothing
more
to
say
it
flew
down
and
the
young
girl
caught
it
pulled
a
feather
from
its
wing
dipped
it
into
the
jar
and
anointed
her
brothers
nostrils
and
they
at
once
came
to
life
again
then
she
did
the
same
with
all
the
other
statues
with
the
lions
and
the
giants
until
all
became
alive
again
then
she
departed
with
her
brothers
and
all
the
noblemen
princes
barons
and
kings
sons
rejoiced
greatly
now
when
they
had
all
come
to
life
again
the
palace
disappeared
and
the
hermits
disappeared
for
they
were
the
three
fairies
the
day
after
the
brothers
and
sister
reached
the
city
where
they
lived
they
summoned
a
goldsmith
and
had
him
make
a
gold
chain
and
fasten
the
bird
with
it
the
next
time
the
aunts
looked
out
they
saw
in
the
window
of
the
palace
opposite
the
dancing
water
the
singing
apple
and
the
speaking
bird
well
said
they
the
real
trouble
is
coming
now
the
bird
directed
the
brothers
and
sister
to
procure
a
carriage
finer
than
the
king
with
attendants
and
to
have
the
service
of
their
palace
cooks
and
servants
more
numerous
and
better
than
the
king
all
of
which
the
brothers
did
at
once
and
when
the
aunts
saw
these
things
they
were
ready
to
die
of
rage
at
last
the
king
returned
from
the
war
and
his
subjects
told
him
all
the
news
of
the
kingdom
and
the
thing
they
talked
about
the
least
was
his
wife
and
children
one
day
the
king
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
palace
opposite
furnished
in
a
magnificent
manner
who
lives
there
he
asked
but
no
one
could
answer
him
he
looked
again
and
saw
the
brothers
and
sister
the
former
with
the
apples
in
their
hands
and
the
latter
with
the
star
on
her
brow
gracious
if
i
did
not
know
that
my
wife
had
given
birth
to
three
puppies
i
should
say
that
those
were
my
children
exclaimed
the
king
another
day
he
stood
by
the
window
and
enjoyed
the
dancing
water
and
the
singing
apple
but
the
bird
was
silent
after
the
king
had
heard
all
the
music
the
bird
said
what
does
your
majesty
think
of
it
the
king
was
astonished
at
hearing
the
speaking
bird
and
answered
what
should
i
think
it
is
marvellous
there
is
something
more
marvellous
said
the
bird
just
wait
then
the
bird
told
his
mistress
to
call
her
brothers
and
said
there
is
the
king
let
us
invite
him
to
dinner
on
sunday
shall
we
not
yes
yes
they
all
said
so
the
king
was
invited
and
accepted
and
on
sunday
the
bird
had
a
grand
dinner
prepared
and
the
king
came
when
he
saw
the
young
people
he
clapped
his
hands
and
said
i
can
not
persuade
myself
they
seem
my
children
he
went
over
the
palace
and
was
astonished
at
its
richness
then
they
went
to
dinner
and
while
they
were
eating
the
king
said
bird
every
one
is
talking
you
alone
are
silent
ah
your
majesty
i
am
ill
but
next
sunday
i
shall
be
well
and
able
to
talk
and
will
come
and
dine
at
your
palace
with
this
lady
and
these
gentlemen
the
next
sunday
the
bird
directed
his
mistress
and
her
brothers
to
put
on
their
finest
clothes
so
they
dressed
in
royal
style
and
took
the
bird
with
them
the
king
showed
them
through
his
palace
and
treated
them
with
the
greatest
ceremony
the
aunts
were
nearly
dead
with
fear
when
they
had
seated
themselves
at
the
table
the
king
said
come
bird
you
promised
me
you
would
speak
have
you
nothing
to
say
then
the
bird
began
and
related
all
that
had
happened
from
the
time
the
king
had
listened
at
the
door
until
his
poor
wife
had
been
sent
to
the
then
the
bird
added
these
are
your
children
and
your
wife
was
sent
to
the
mill
and
is
dying
when
the
king
heard
all
this
he
hastened
to
embrace
his
children
and
then
went
to
find
his
poor
wife
who
was
reduced
to
skin
and
bones
and
was
at
the
point
of
death
he
knelt
before
her
and
begged
her
pardon
and
then
summoned
her
sisters
and
the
nurse
and
when
they
were
in
his
presence
he
said
to
the
bird
bird
you
who
have
told
me
everything
now
pronounce
their
sentence
then
the
bird
sentenced
the
nurse
to
be
thrown
out
of
the
window
and
the
sisters
to
be
cast
into
a
cauldron
of
boiling
oil
this
was
at
once
done
the
king
was
never
tired
of
embracing
his
wife
then
the
bird
departed
and
the
king
and
his
wife
and
children
lived
together
in
peace
we
next
pass
to
the
class
of
stories
in
which
children
are
promised
by
their
parents
to
witches
or
the
evil
one
the
children
who
are
thus
promised
are
often
unborn
and
the
promise
is
made
by
the
parents
either
to
escape
some
danger
with
which
they
are
threatened
by
witch
or
demon
or
in
return
for
money
sometimes
there
is
a
misunderstanding
as
in
grimm
story
of
the
handless
maiden
where
the
miller
in
return
for
riches
promises
the
evil
one
to
give
him
what
stands
behind
his
mill
the
miller
supposes
his
is
meant
but
it
is
his
daughter
who
happened
to
be
behind
the
mill
when
the
compact
was
made
the
most
usual
form
of
the
story
in
italian
is
this
a
woman
who
expects
to
give
birth
to
a
child
is
seized
with
a
great
longing
for
some
herb
or
fruit
generally
parsley
growing
in
the
witch
garden
the
witch
ogress
catches
her
picking
it
and
only
releases
her
on
condition
that
she
shall
give
her
the
child
after
it
is
born
and
has
reached
a
definite
age
the
following
sicilian
story
from
gonzenbach
no
will
illustrate
this
class
sufficiently
the
fair
angiola
once
upon
a
time
there
were
seven
women
neighbors
all
of
whom
were
seized
with
a
great
longing
for
some
jujubes
which
only
grew
in
a
garden
opposite
the
place
where
they
all
lived
and
which
belonged
to
a
witch
now
this
witch
had
a
donkey
that
watched
the
garden
and
told
the
old
witch
when
any
one
entered
the
seven
neighbors
however
had
such
a
desire
for
the
jujubes
that
they
entered
the
garden
and
threw
the
donkey
some
nice
soft
grass
and
while
he
was
eating
it
they
filled
their
aprons
with
jujubes
and
escaped
before
the
witch
appeared
this
they
did
several
times
until
at
last
the
witch
noticed
that
some
one
had
been
in
her
garden
for
many
of
the
jujubes
were
gone
she
questioned
the
donkey
but
he
had
eaten
the
nice
grass
and
noticed
nothing
then
she
resolved
the
third
day
to
remain
in
the
garden
herself
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
hole
in
which
she
hid
and
covered
herself
with
leaves
and
branches
leaving
only
one
of
her
long
ears
sticking
out
the
seven
neighbors
once
more
went
into
the
garden
and
began
picking
jujubes
when
one
of
them
noticed
the
witch
ear
sticking
out
of
the
leaves
and
thought
it
was
a
mushroom
and
tried
to
pick
it
then
the
witch
jumped
out
of
the
hole
and
ran
after
the
women
all
of
whom
escaped
but
one
the
witch
was
going
to
eat
her
but
she
begged
hard
for
pardon
and
promised
never
to
enter
the
garden
again
the
witch
finally
forgave
her
on
the
condition
that
she
would
give
her
her
child
yet
unborn
whether
a
boy
or
girl
when
it
was
seven
years
old
the
poor
woman
promised
in
her
distress
and
the
witch
let
her
go
some
time
after
the
woman
had
a
beautiful
little
girl
whom
she
named
angiola
when
angiola
was
six
years
old
her
mother
sent
her
to
school
to
learn
to
sew
and
knit
on
her
way
to
school
she
had
to
pass
the
garden
where
the
witch
lived
one
day
when
she
was
almost
seven
she
saw
the
witch
standing
in
front
of
her
garden
she
beckoned
to
angiola
and
gave
her
some
fine
fruits
and
said
you
see
fair
angiola
i
am
your
aunt
tell
your
mother
you
have
seen
your
aunt
and
she
sends
her
word
not
to
forget
her
promise
angiola
went
home
and
told
her
mother
who
was
frightened
and
said
to
herself
ah
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
give
up
my
angiola
then
she
said
to
the
child
when
your
aunt
asks
you
for
an
answer
tell
her
you
forgot
her
errand
the
next
day
she
told
the
witch
as
she
was
directed
very
well
she
replied
tell
her
but
do
forget
thus
several
days
passed
the
witch
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
angiola
when
she
went
to
school
and
wanted
to
know
her
mother
answer
but
angiola
always
declared
that
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
her
one
day
however
the
witch
became
angry
and
said
since
you
are
so
forgetful
i
must
give
you
some
token
to
remind
you
of
your
errand
then
she
bit
angiola
little
finger
so
hard
that
she
bit
a
piece
out
angiola
went
home
in
tears
and
showed
her
mother
her
finger
ah
thought
her
mother
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
must
give
my
poor
child
to
the
witch
or
else
she
will
eat
her
up
in
her
anger
the
next
morning
as
angiola
was
going
to
school
her
mother
said
to
her
tell
your
aunt
to
do
with
you
as
she
thinks
best
angiola
did
so
and
the
witch
said
very
well
then
come
with
me
for
you
are
mine
so
the
witch
took
the
fair
angiola
with
her
and
led
her
away
to
a
tower
which
had
no
door
and
but
one
small
window
there
angiola
lived
with
the
witch
who
treated
her
very
kindly
for
she
loved
her
as
her
own
child
when
the
witch
came
home
after
her
excursions
she
stood
under
the
window
and
cried
angiola
fair
angiola
let
down
your
pretty
tresses
and
pull
me
up
now
angiola
had
beautiful
long
hair
which
she
let
down
and
with
which
she
pulled
the
witch
up
now
it
happened
one
day
when
angiola
had
grown
to
be
a
large
and
beautiful
maiden
that
the
king
son
went
hunting
and
chanced
to
come
where
the
tower
was
he
was
astonished
at
seeing
the
house
without
any
door
and
wondered
how
the
people
got
in
just
then
the
old
witch
returned
home
stood
under
the
window
and
called
angiola
fair
angiola
let
down
your
beautiful
tresses
and
pull
me
up
immediately
the
beautiful
tresses
fell
down
and
the
witch
climbed
up
by
them
this
pleased
the
prince
greatly
and
he
hid
himself
near
by
until
the
witch
went
away
again
then
he
went
and
stood
under
the
window
and
called
angiola
fair
angiola
let
down
your
beautiful
tresses
and
pull
me
up
then
angiola
let
down
her
tresses
and
drew
up
the
prince
for
she
believed
it
was
the
witch
when
she
saw
the
prince
she
was
much
frightened
at
first
but
he
addressed
her
in
a
friendly
manner
and
begged
her
to
fly
with
him
and
become
his
wife
she
finally
consented
and
in
order
that
the
witch
should
not
know
where
she
had
gone
she
gave
all
the
chairs
tables
and
cupboards
in
the
house
something
to
eat
for
they
were
all
living
beings
and
might
betray
her
the
broom
however
stood
behind
the
door
so
she
did
not
notice
it
and
gave
it
nothing
to
eat
then
she
took
from
the
witch
chamber
three
magic
balls
of
yarn
and
fled
with
the
prince
the
witch
had
a
little
dog
that
loved
the
fair
angiola
so
dearly
that
it
followed
her
soon
after
they
had
fled
the
witch
came
back
and
called
angiola
fair
angiola
let
down
your
beautiful
tresses
and
draw
me
up
but
the
tresses
were
not
let
down
for
all
she
called
and
at
last
she
had
to
get
a
long
ladder
and
climb
in
at
the
window
when
she
could
not
find
angiola
she
asked
the
tables
and
chairs
and
cupboards
where
has
she
fled
but
they
answered
we
do
not
know
the
broom
however
called
out
from
the
corner
the
fair
angiola
has
fled
with
the
king
son
who
is
going
to
marry
her
then
the
witch
started
in
pursuit
of
them
and
nearly
overtook
them
but
angiola
threw
down
behind
her
one
of
the
magic
balls
of
yarn
and
there
arose
a
great
mountain
of
soap
when
the
witch
tried
to
climb
it
she
slipped
back
but
she
persevered
until
at
last
she
succeeded
in
getting
over
it
and
hastened
after
the
fugitives
then
angiola
threw
down
the
second
ball
of
yarn
and
there
arose
a
great
mountain
covered
all
over
with
nails
small
and
large
again
the
witch
had
to
struggle
hard
to
cross
it
when
she
did
she
was
almost
flayed
when
angiola
saw
that
the
witch
had
almost
overtaken
them
again
she
threw
down
the
third
ball
and
there
arose
a
mighty
torrent
the
witch
tried
to
swim
across
it
but
the
stream
kept
increasing
in
size
until
she
had
at
last
to
turn
back
then
in
her
anger
she
cursed
the
fair
angiola
saying
may
your
beautiful
face
be
turned
into
the
face
of
a
dog
and
instantly
angiola
face
became
a
dog
face
the
prince
was
very
sorrowful
and
said
how
can
i
take
you
home
to
my
parents
they
would
never
allow
me
to
marry
a
maiden
with
a
dog
face
so
he
took
her
to
a
little
house
where
she
was
to
live
until
the
enchantment
was
removed
he
himself
returned
to
his
parents
but
whenever
he
went
hunting
he
visited
poor
angiola
she
often
wept
bitterly
over
her
misfortunes
until
one
day
the
little
dog
that
had
followed
her
from
the
witch
said
do
not
weep
fair
angiola
i
will
go
to
the
witch
and
beg
her
to
remove
the
enchantment
then
the
little
dog
started
off
and
returned
to
the
witch
and
sprang
up
on
her
and
caressed
her
are
you
here
again
you
ungrateful
beast
cried
the
witch
and
pushed
the
dog
away
did
you
leave
me
to
follow
the
ungrateful
angiola
but
the
little
dog
caressed
her
until
she
grew
friendly
again
and
took
him
up
on
her
lap
mother
said
the
little
dog
angiola
sends
you
greeting
she
is
very
sad
for
she
can
not
go
to
the
palace
with
her
dog
face
and
can
not
marry
the
prince
that
serves
her
right
said
the
witch
why
did
she
deceive
me
she
can
keep
her
dog
face
now
but
the
dog
begged
her
so
earnestly
saying
that
poor
angiola
was
sufficiently
punished
that
at
last
the
witch
gave
the
dog
a
flask
of
water
and
said
take
that
to
her
and
she
will
become
the
fair
angiola
again
the
dog
thanked
her
ran
off
with
the
flask
and
brought
it
safely
to
poor
angiola
as
soon
as
she
washed
in
the
water
her
dog
face
disappeared
and
she
became
beautiful
again
more
beautiful
even
than
she
had
been
before
the
prince
full
of
joy
took
her
to
the
palace
and
the
king
and
queen
were
so
pleased
with
her
beauty
that
they
welcomed
her
and
gave
her
a
splendid
wedding
and
all
remained
happy
and
contented
an
interesting
class
of
stories
is
the
one
in
which
the
heroes
are
twin
brothers
sometimes
three
born
at
the
same
time
or
a
larger
number
who
are
born
in
some
unusual
manner
generally
in
consequence
of
the
mother
partaking
of
some
magic
fruit
or
fish
one
of
the
brothers
undertakes
some
difficult
task
liberation
of
princess
etc
and
falls
into
great
danger
the
other
brother
discovers
the
fact
from
some
sympathetic
object
and
proceeds
to
rescue
him
the
following
story
from
pisa
comparetti
no
will
give
a
good
idea
of
the
italian
stories
of
this
class
vi
the
cloud
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
fisherman
who
had
a
wife
and
many
children
now
it
happened
that
the
fisherman
did
not
catch
any
fish
for
a
time
and
did
not
know
how
to
support
his
family
one
day
he
cast
his
net
and
drew
out
a
large
fish
which
began
to
talk
let
me
go
and
cast
in
your
net
again
and
you
will
catch
as
many
fish
as
you
wish
the
fisherman
did
so
and
caught
more
fish
than
he
remembered
to
have
taken
before
but
in
a
few
days
the
fish
were
gone
and
the
fisherman
cast
his
net
again
and
again
caught
the
big
fish
which
said
i
see
clearly
that
i
must
die
so
kill
me
now
and
cut
me
into
pieces
give
half
to
the
king
a
piece
to
your
wife
one
to
your
dog
and
one
to
your
horse
the
bones
you
will
tie
to
the
kitchen
rafters
your
wife
will
bear
sons
and
when
anything
happens
to
one
of
them
the
will
sweat
drops
of
blood
the
fisherman
did
as
he
was
told
and
in
due
time
his
wife
gave
birth
to
three
sons
the
dog
to
three
puppies
and
the
horse
to
three
colts
the
boys
grew
up
and
went
to
school
and
learned
much
and
prospered
one
day
the
oldest
said
i
want
to
go
and
see
a
little
of
the
world
and
took
one
of
the
dogs
one
of
the
horses
and
some
money
and
set
out
after
receiving
his
father
and
mother
blessing
he
arrived
at
a
forest
and
there
saw
a
lion
an
eagle
and
an
ant
which
had
found
a
dead
ass
that
they
wanted
to
divide
among
themselves
but
could
not
agree
and
so
were
quarrelling
they
saw
the
youth
and
called
on
him
to
make
the
division
he
was
afraid
at
first
but
took
heart
and
gave
the
lean
meat
to
the
eagle
the
brains
to
the
ant
and
the
rest
to
the
lion
they
were
all
satisfied
and
the
youth
continued
his
way
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
the
animals
called
him
back
and
the
lion
said
you
have
settled
our
dispute
and
we
wish
to
reward
you
when
you
wish
to
become
a
lion
you
have
only
to
say
more
a
man
a
lion
with
the
strength
of
a
hundred
lions
the
eagle
said
when
you
wish
to
become
an
eagle
say
more
a
man
an
eagle
with
the
strength
of
a
hundred
eagles
the
ant
also
gave
him
power
to
transform
himself
into
an
ant
in
the
same
way
the
youth
thanked
them
and
departed
as
he
was
passing
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
he
saw
a
that
was
out
of
the
water
he
put
it
back
into
the
sea
the
fish
said
when
you
need
me
come
to
the
sea
and
cry
help
me
the
youth
continued
his
way
and
arrived
at
a
city
all
hung
with
mourning
what
is
the
matter
the
young
man
asked
there
is
here
they
told
him
a
big
cloud
it
was
a
fairy
that
every
year
must
have
a
young
girl
this
year
the
lot
has
fallen
on
the
king
daughter
if
they
do
not
give
her
up
the
cloud
will
throw
so
many
things
into
the
city
that
we
shall
all
be
killed
the
youth
asked
if
he
could
see
how
the
thing
went
and
they
told
him
he
could
the
ceremony
began
with
muffled
drums
and
an
escort
of
soldiers
the
king
and
queen
in
tears
accompanied
their
daughter
who
was
taken
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
placed
in
a
chair
and
left
alone
the
youth
who
had
followed
them
hid
himself
behind
a
bush
then
the
cloud
came
took
the
young
girl
in
her
lap
took
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
began
to
suck
her
blood
this
was
what
the
cloud
lived
on
the
princess
remained
half
dead
like
a
log
and
then
the
cloud
carried
her
away
the
youth
who
had
seen
all
this
cried
no
more
a
man
an
eagle
with
the
strength
of
a
hundred
eagles
then
he
became
an
eagle
and
flew
after
the
cloud
they
arrived
at
a
palace
the
doors
flew
open
and
the
cloud
entered
and
carried
the
princess
the
eagle
alighted
on
a
tree
opposite
and
saw
a
large
room
all
full
of
young
girls
in
bed
when
the
cloud
entered
they
exclaimed
mamma
here
is
our
mamma
the
poor
girls
were
always
in
bed
because
the
fairy
half
killed
them
she
put
the
princess
in
a
bed
and
said
to
the
girls
i
am
going
to
leave
you
for
a
few
days
she
went
away
and
left
the
girls
the
youth
was
near
and
heard
everything
he
said
no
more
an
eagle
an
ant
with
the
force
of
a
hundred
ants
he
became
an
ant
entered
the
palace
unseen
and
went
to
the
room
where
the
young
girls
were
there
he
resumed
his
shape
and
the
girls
were
astonished
at
seeing
a
man
appear
so
suddenly
and
one
of
them
said
to
him
take
care
there
is
a
fairy
here
if
she
finds
you
on
her
return
she
will
kill
you
do
not
be
troubled
he
answered
for
i
wish
to
see
about
setting
you
all
free
then
he
went
to
the
bed
of
the
king
daughter
and
asked
her
if
she
had
some
token
to
send
her
mother
she
gave
him
a
ring
and
the
youth
took
it
and
went
to
the
queen
told
her
where
her
daughter
was
and
asked
her
to
send
some
food
to
the
poor
girl
she
did
so
and
the
youth
retraced
his
steps
reached
the
palace
informed
the
girls
and
drew
up
the
food
with
ropes
he
then
said
to
the
girls
when
the
fairy
returns
ask
her
what
you
shall
do
when
she
dies
thus
you
will
find
out
how
to
kill
her
then
he
hid
himself
and
when
the
fairy
returned
the
girls
asked
her
the
question
but
she
answered
i
shall
never
die
they
urged
her
to
tell
them
and
the
next
day
she
took
them
out
on
a
terrace
and
said
do
you
see
that
mountain
far
off
there
on
that
mountain
is
a
tigress
with
seven
heads
if
you
wish
me
to
die
a
lion
must
fight
that
tigress
and
tear
off
all
seven
of
her
heads
in
her
body
is
an
egg
and
if
any
one
hits
me
with
it
in
the
middle
of
my
forehead
i
shall
die
but
if
that
egg
falls
into
my
hands
the
tigress
will
come
to
life
again
resume
her
seven
heads
and
i
shall
live
good
said
the
young
girls
certainly
our
mamma
can
never
die
but
in
their
hearts
they
were
discouraged
when
the
fairy
had
departed
the
youth
came
forth
and
they
told
him
all
do
not
be
disheartened
he
said
and
straightway
went
to
the
princess
father
asked
him
for
a
room
a
pan
of
bread
a
barrel
of
good
wine
and
a
child
seven
years
old
he
took
all
these
things
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
room
and
said
to
the
child
do
you
want
to
see
something
my
child
i
am
going
to
turn
into
a
lion
then
he
turned
into
a
lion
and
the
child
was
afraid
but
the
youth
persuaded
him
that
it
was
only
himself
after
all
and
the
child
fed
him
and
was
no
longer
frightened
as
soon
as
he
had
instructed
the
child
he
took
all
the
things
and
went
to
the
mountain
where
the
tigress
was
then
he
filled
the
pan
with
bread
and
wine
and
said
to
the
child
i
am
going
to
become
a
lion
when
i
return
give
me
something
to
eat
then
he
became
a
lion
and
went
to
fight
the
tigress
meanwhile
the
fairy
returned
home
saying
alas
i
feel
ill
the
young
girls
said
to
themselves
in
delight
good
the
youth
fought
until
night
and
tore
off
one
of
the
tigress
heads
the
second
day
another
and
so
on
until
six
heads
were
gone
the
fairy
kept
losing
her
strength
all
the
time
the
youth
rested
two
days
before
tearing
off
the
last
head
and
then
resumed
the
fight
at
evening
the
last
head
was
torn
off
and
the
dead
tigress
disappeared
but
the
youth
was
not
quick
enough
to
catch
the
egg
which
rolled
from
her
body
into
the
sea
and
was
swallowed
by
the
then
the
youth
went
to
the
sea
help
me
the
fish
appeared
what
do
you
want
have
you
found
an
egg
yes
give
it
to
me
and
the
fish
gave
him
the
egg
he
took
it
and
went
in
search
of
the
fairy
and
suddenly
appeared
before
her
with
the
egg
in
his
hand
the
fairy
wanted
him
to
give
her
the
egg
but
he
made
her
first
restore
all
the
young
girls
to
health
and
send
them
home
in
handsome
carriages
then
the
youth
took
the
egg
struck
it
on
the
fairy
forehead
and
she
fell
down
dead
when
the
youth
saw
that
she
was
really
dead
he
entered
a
carriage
with
the
king
daughter
and
drove
to
the
palace
when
the
king
and
queen
saw
their
daughter
again
they
wept
for
joy
and
married
her
to
her
deliverer
the
wedding
took
place
with
great
magnificence
and
there
were
great
festivities
and
rejoicings
in
the
city
a
few
days
after
the
husband
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
dense
fog
he
said
to
his
wife
i
will
go
and
see
what
that
fog
is
so
he
dressed
for
the
chase
and
went
away
with
his
dog
and
horse
after
he
had
passed
through
the
mist
he
saw
a
mountain
on
which
were
two
beautiful
ladies
they
came
to
meet
him
and
invited
him
to
their
palace
he
accepted
and
they
showed
him
into
a
room
and
one
of
the
ladies
asked
would
you
like
to
play
a
game
of
chess
very
well
he
answered
and
began
to
play
and
lost
then
they
took
him
into
a
garden
where
there
were
many
marble
statues
and
turned
him
into
one
together
with
his
dog
and
horse
these
ladies
were
sisters
of
the
fairy
and
this
was
the
way
they
avenged
her
death
meanwhile
the
princess
waited
and
her
husband
did
not
return
one
morning
the
father
and
brothers
of
the
youth
found
the
kitchen
full
of
blood
which
dropped
from
the
something
has
happened
to
him
they
said
and
the
second
brother
started
in
search
of
him
with
another
one
of
the
dogs
and
horses
he
passed
by
the
palace
of
the
princess
who
was
at
the
window
and
those
brothers
looked
so
much
alike
that
when
she
saw
him
she
thought
it
was
her
husband
and
called
him
he
entered
and
she
spoke
to
him
of
the
fog
but
he
did
not
understand
her
he
let
her
talk
on
however
imagining
that
his
brother
was
mixed
up
in
that
affair
the
next
morning
he
arose
and
went
to
see
the
fog
with
his
dog
and
horse
he
passed
through
the
fog
found
the
mountain
and
the
two
ladies
and
to
make
the
story
short
the
same
thing
happened
to
him
that
happened
to
his
brother
and
he
became
stone
and
the
queen
waited
and
in
the
father
kitchen
the
bone
dropped
blood
faster
than
ever
the
third
brother
too
set
out
with
his
dog
and
horse
when
he
came
to
the
palace
the
princess
saw
him
from
the
window
took
him
for
her
husband
and
called
him
in
he
entered
and
she
reproved
him
for
having
made
her
wait
so
long
and
spoke
of
the
mist
but
he
did
not
understand
her
and
said
i
did
not
see
very
clearly
what
was
in
the
mist
and
i
wish
to
go
there
again
he
departed
and
when
he
had
passed
through
the
mist
he
met
an
old
man
who
said
to
him
where
are
you
going
take
care
your
brothers
have
been
turned
into
statues
you
will
meet
two
ladies
if
they
ask
you
to
play
chess
with
them
here
are
two
pawns
say
that
you
can
not
play
except
with
your
own
pawns
then
make
an
agreement
with
them
that
if
you
win
you
can
do
with
them
what
you
please
if
they
win
they
can
do
what
they
please
with
you
if
you
win
and
they
beg
for
mercy
command
them
to
restore
to
life
all
the
stone
statues
with
which
the
palace
is
filled
and
when
they
have
done
so
you
can
do
what
you
will
with
these
ladies
the
youth
thanked
the
old
man
departed
followed
his
directions
and
won
the
two
ladies
begged
for
their
lives
and
he
granted
their
prayer
on
condition
of
restoring
to
life
all
those
stone
statues
they
took
a
wand
touched
the
statues
and
they
became
animated
but
no
sooner
were
they
all
restored
to
life
than
they
fell
on
the
two
ladies
and
cut
them
into
bits
no
larger
than
their
ears
thus
the
three
brothers
were
reunited
they
related
their
adventures
and
returned
to
the
palace
the
princess
was
astonished
when
she
saw
them
and
did
not
know
which
was
her
husband
but
he
made
himself
known
told
her
that
these
were
his
brothers
and
they
had
their
parents
come
there
and
they
all
lived
happily
together
and
thus
the
story
is
ended
we
now
pass
to
the
class
of
stories
in
which
one
of
several
brothers
succeeds
in
some
undertaking
where
the
others
fail
and
thereby
draws
down
on
himself
the
hatred
of
the
others
who
either
abandon
him
in
a
cavern
or
kill
him
and
hide
his
body
which
is
afterwards
discovered
by
a
musical
instrument
made
of
one
of
the
bones
or
of
the
reeds
growing
over
the
grave
the
former
treatment
is
illustrated
by
a
sicilian
tale
pitrè
no
called
vii
the
cistern

were
once
three

a
man
with
a
rope
and
a
bell
and
took
them
with
them
when
they
reached
the
cistern
they
lowered

the

and
said
to

your
brothers
will
leave
you

he
said
he
would

finally
he
prevailed
and
she
ascended
when
she
appeared
the
two
brothers
took
her
and
left
salvatore
in
the
cistern
and
returned
to
the
palace
when
they
arrived
there
they
said
to
their
father
we
have
looked
for
salvatore
but
we
could
not
find
him
but
we
have
found
these
three
young
girls
and

take
this
one
and
i
said
the
second
take
this
one
the
other
sister
we
will
marry
to
some
other
youth
now
let
us
return
to
salvatore
who
when
he
found
himself
alone
and
disconsolate
felt
in
his
pockets
and
touched
the
apple
o
my
apple
get
me
out
of
this
place
and
at
once
he
found
himself
out
of
the
cistern
he
went
to
the
city
where
he
lived
and
met
a
silversmith
who
took
him
as
an
apprentice
feeding
and
clothing
him
while
he
was
with
the
silversmith
the
king
commanded
the
latter
to
make
a
crown
for
his
oldest
son
who
was
to
be
married
you
must
make
me
a
royal
crown
for
my
son
and
evening
you
must
bring
it
to
me
he
gave
him
ten
ounces
and
dismissed
him
when
he
reached
home
the
silversmith
was
greatly
disturbed
for
he
had
such
a
short
time
to
make
the
crown
in
salvatore
said
grandfather
why
are
you
so
disturbed
the
master
replied
take
these
ten
ounces
for
now
i
am
going
to
seek
refuge
in
a
church
for
there
is
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
for
in
olden
times
the
church
had
the
privilege
that
whoever
robbed
or
killed
fled
to
the
church
and
they
could
not
do
anything
with
him
the
apprentice
replied
now
i
will
see
if
i
can
make
this
crown
my
master
would
take
refuge
in
a
church
for
a
trifle
so
he
began
to
make
the
crown
what
did
he
do
he
took
out
the
apple
and
commanded
it
to
make
a
very
beautiful
crown
he
hammered
away
but
the
apple
made
the
crown
when
it
was
finished
he
gave
it
to
the
wife
of
the
silversmith
who
took
it
to
her
husband
when
the
latter
saw
that
he
need
not
flee
to
the
church
he
went
to
the
king
who
well
pleased
invited
him
to
the
feast
in
the
evening
when
he
told
this
at
home
the
apprentice
said
take
me
to
the
feast
how
can
i
take
you
when
you
have
no
clothes
fit
to
wear
i
will
buy
you
some
and
when
there
is
another
feast
i
will
take
you
when
it
struck
two
the
silversmith
departed
and
salvatore
took
the
apple
and
said
o
my
apple
give
me
clothes
and
carriages
and
footmen
for
i
am
going
to
see
my
brother
married
immediately
he
was
dressed
like
a
prince
and
went
to
the
palace
where
he
hid
in
the
kitchen
saw
his
brother
married
and
then
took
a
big
stick
and
gave
the
silversmith
a
sound
beating
when
the
latter
reached
home
he
cried
i
am
dying
i
am
dying
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
apprentice
and
when
he
learned
what
had
happened
he
said
if
you
had
taken
me
with
you
to
the
feast
this
would
not
have
happened
a
few
days
after
the
king
summoned
the
silversmith
again
to
make
another
crown
within
hours
everything
happened
as
before
the
apprentice
made
a
crown
handsomer
than
the
first
with
the
aid
of
the
pomegranate
the
smith
took
it
to
the
king
but
after
the
feast
came
home
with
his
shoulders
black
and
blue
from
the
beating
he
received
after
a
time
they
wanted
to
marry
the
third
sister
but
she
said
who
wishes
me
must
wait
a
year
a
month
and
a
day
and
she
had
no
peace
wondering
why
salvatore
did
not
appear
for
all
he
had
the
apple
the
pomegranate
and
the
crown
after
a
year
a
month
and
a
day
the
wedding
was
arranged
and
the
smith
had
orders
to
make
another
crown
more
beautiful
than
the
first
two
this
was
so
that
no
one
could
say
that
because
the
young
girl
was
a
foreigner
they
treated
her
worse
than
the
others
again
the
smith
was
in
despair
and
the
apprentice
had
to
make
by
the
aid
of
his
magic
crown
a
better
and
larger
crown
than
the
others
the
king
was
astonished
when
he
saw
the
beautiful
crown
and
again
invited
the
silversmith
to
the
feast
the
smith
returned
home
sorrowful
for
fear
that
he
should
again
receive
a
beating
but
he
would
not
take
his
apprentice
with
him
after
salvatore
had
seen
him
depart
he
took
his
magic
crown
and
ordered
splendid
clothes
and
carriages
when
he
reached
the
palace
he
did
not
go
to
the
kitchen
but
before
the
bride
and
groom
could
say
yes
stop
said
salvatore
he
took
the
apple
and
said
who
gave
me
this
i
did
replied
the
wife
of
the
oldest
brother
and
this
showing
the
pomegranate
i
my
said
the
wife
of
the
second
brother
then
he
took
out
the
crown
who
gave
me
that
i
my
husband
said
the
young
girl
whom
they
were
marrying
and
at
once
she
married
salvatore
for
said
she
he
freed
me
from
the
magician
the
bridegroom
was
fooled
and
had
to
go
away
and
the
astonished
silversmith
fell
on
his
knees
begging
for
pity
and
mercy
in
some
of
the
versions
of
the
above
story
the
hero
after
he
is
abandoned
by
his
brothers
in
the
cistern
or
cave
is
borne
into
the
upper
world
by
an
eagle
the
rapacious
bird
on
the
journey
demands
from
the
young
man
flesh
from
time
to
time
at
last
the
stock
of
flesh
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
is
exhausted
and
he
is
obliged
to
cut
off
and
give
the
eagle
a
piece
of
his
own
flesh
in
one
version
pitrè
ii
he
gives
the
eagle
his
leg
and
when
the
journey
is
concluded
the
bird
casts
it
up
and
the
hero
attaches
it
again
to
his
body
and
becomes
as
sound
as
ever
the
class
of
stories
in
which
the
brother
is
killed
and
his
death
made
known
by
a
musical
instrument
fashioned
from
his
body
is
sufficiently
illustrated
by
a
short
neapolitan
story
imbriani
entitled
viii
the
griffin
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
three
sons
his
eyes
were
diseased
and
he
called
in
a
physician
who
said
that
to
cure
them
he
needed
a
feather
of
the
griffin
then
the
king
said
to
his
sons
he
who
finds
this
feather
for
me
shall
have
my
crown
the
sons
set
out
in
search
of
it
the
youngest
met
an
old
man
who
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
he
replied
papa
is
to
cure
him
a
feather
of
the
griffin
is
necessary
and
papa
has
said
that
whoever
finds
the
feather
shall
have
his
crown
the
old
man
said
well
here
is
some
corn
when
you
reach
a
certain
place
put
it
in
your
hat
the
griffin
will
come
and
eat
it
seize
him
pull
out
a
feather
and
carry
it
to
papa
the
youth
did
so
and
for
fear
that
some
one
should
steal
it
from
him
he
put
it
into
his
shoe
and
started
all
joyful
to
carry
it
to
his
father
on
his
way
he
met
his
brothers
who
asked
him
if
he
had
found
the
feather
he
said
no
but
his
brothers
did
not
believe
him
and
wanted
to
search
him
they
looked
everywhere
but
did
not
find
it
finally
they
looked
in
his
shoe
and
got
it
then
they
killed
the
youngest
brother
and
buried
him
and
took
the
feather
to
their
father
saying
that
they
had
found
it
the
king
healed
his
eyes
with
it
a
shepherd
one
day
while
feeding
his
sheep
saw
that
his
dog
was
always
digging
in
the
same
place
and
went
to
see
what
it
was
and
found
a
bone
he
put
it
to
his
mouth
and
saw
that
it
sounded
and
said
shepherd
keep
me
in
your
mouth
hold
me
tight
and
do
not
let
me
go
for
a
feather
of
the
griffin
my
brother
has
played
the
traitor
my
brother
has
played
the
traitor
one
day
the
shepherd
with
this
whistle
in
his
mouth
was
passing
by
the
king
palace
and
the
king
heard
him
and
called
him
to
see
what
it
was
the
shepherd
told
him
the
story
and
how
he
had
found
it
the
king
put
it
to
his
mouth
and
the
whistle
said
papa

a
feather
of
the
griffin
you
have
played
the
traitor
you
have
played
the
traitor
then
the
king
understood
the
story
and
had
his
two
sons
put
to
death
and
thus
they
killed
their
brother
and
afterwards
were
killed

captivates
the

recognizes
her
by

there
are
two
branches
of

one
just
mentioned
and
one
where
the
heroine
assumes
a
repulsive
disguise
in
order
to
escape
the
importunities
of
a
father

branch
may

had
repeated
it
three
or
four
times
it
answered

and
she
became
homely
and
the
bird
continued

are
discovered
she
began
to
weep
in
earnest
when
her
sisters
returned

cried

imagine
that
she
did
not

times

for

but

the
girl

to
call

but
she
did
not

a
time
she
said

the
matter

went
to
the
little
bird

then
she
was
dressed
as

and
stars
and
in

great
chains
all
of

bosom
she
puts
the
bird
in
her
bosom
and
begins
to
descend

said
the
father
do

her
she
is
dragging
with
her
the
chains
from

imagine
how
frightful
she
will
look
when
she
reached
the
last
step
and
they
saw
her
ah
they
exclaimed
and
recognized
the
lady
of
the
ball
you
can
imagine
how
her
father
and
sisters
were
vexed
they
made
her
sit
down
and
tried
on
the
slipper
and
it
fitted
her
then
they
made
her
enter
the
carriage
and
took
her
to
his
majesty
who
recognized
the
lady
of
the
other
evenings
and
you
can
imagine
that
all
in
love
as
he
was
he
said
to
her
will
you
really
be
my
wife
you
may
believe
she
consents
she
sends
for
her
father
and
sisters
and
makes
them
all
come
to
the
palace
they
celebrate
the
marriage
imagine
what
fine
festivals
were
given
at
this
wedding
the
servants
who
had
discovered
where
cinderella
lived
were
promoted
to
the
highest
positions
in
the
palace
as
a
reward
in
the
second
class
of
stories
alluded
to
above
the
heroine
flees
in
disguise
from
her
home
to
avoid
a
marriage
with
her
father
or
brother
the
remainder
of
the
story
resembles
cinderella
the
heroine
reveals
herself
from
time
to
time
in
her
true
form
and
finally
throws
off
her
disguise
the
following
story
which
illustrates
this
class
is
from
the
province
of
vicenza
corazzini
and
is
entitled
x
fair
maria
wood
there
was
once
a
husband
and
wife
who
had
but
one
child
a
daughter
now
it
happened
that
the
wife
fell
ill
and
was
at
the
point
of
death
before
dying
she
called
her
husband
and
said
to
him
weeping
i
am
dying
you
are
still
young
if
you
ever
wish
to
marry
again
be
mindful
to
choose
a
wife
whom
my
wedding
ring
fits
and
if
you
can
not
find
a
lady
whom
it
fits
well
do
not
marry
her
husband
promised
that
he
would
do
so
when
she
was
dead
he
took
off
her
wedding
ring
and
kept
it
until
he
desired
to
marry
again
then
he
sought
for
some
one
to
please
him
he
went
from
one
to
another
but
the
ring
fitted
no
one
he
tried
so
many
but
in
vain
one
day
he
thought
of
calling
his
daughter
and
trying
the
ring
on
her
to
see
whether
it
fitted
her
the
daughter
said
it
is
useless
dear
father
you
can
not
marry
me
because
you
are
my
father
he
did
not
heed
her
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
saw
that
it
fitted
her
well
and
wanted
to
marry
his
daughter
she
did
not
oppose
him
but
consented
the
day
of
the
wedding
he
asked
her
what
she
wanted
she
said
that
she
wished
four
silk
dresses
the
most
beautiful
that
could
be
seen
he
who
was
a
gentleman
gratified
her
wish
and
took
her
the
four
dresses
one
handsomer
than
the
other
and
all
the
handsomest
that
had
ever
been
seen
now
what
else
do
you
want
said
he
i
want
another
dress
made
of
wood
so
that
i
can
conceal
myself
in
it
and
at
once
he
had
this
wooden
dress
made
she
was
well
pleased
she
waited
one
day
until
her
husband
was
out
of
sight
put
on
the
wooden
dress
and
under
it
the
four
silk
dresses
and
went
away
to
a
certain
river
not
far
off
and
threw
herself
in
it
instead
of
sinking
and
drowning
she
floated
for
the
wooden
dress
kept
her
up
the
water
carried
her
a
long
way
when
she
saw
on
the
bank
a
gentleman
and
began
to
cry
who
wants
the
fair
maria
wood
that
gentleman
who
saw
her
on
the
water
and
whom
she
addressed
called
her
and
she
came
to
the
bank
and
saluted
him
how
is
it
that
you
are
thus
dressed
in
wood
and
come
floating
on
the
water
without
drowning
she
told
him
that
she
was
a
poor
girl
who
had
only
that
dress
of
wood
and
that
she
wanted
to
go
out
to
service
what
can
you
do
i
can
do
all
that
is
needed
in
a
house
and
if
you
would
only
take
me
for
a
servant
you
would
be
satisfied
he
took
her
to
his
house
where
his
mother
was
and
told
her
all
that
had
happened
saying
if
you
dear
mother
will
take
her
as
a
servant
we
can
try
her
in
short
she
took
her
and
was
pleased
with
this
woman
dressed
in
wood
it
happened
that
there
were
balls
at
that
place
which
the
best
ladies
and
gentlemen
attended
the
gentleman
who
had
the
servant
dressed
in
wood
prepared
to
go
to
the
ball
and
after
he
had
departed
the
servant
said
to
his
mother
do
me
this
kindness
mistress
let
me
go
to
the
ball
too
for
i
have
never
seen
any
dancing
what
you
wish
to
go
to
the
ball
so
badly
dressed
that
they
would
drive
you
away
as
soon
as
they
saw
you
the
servant
was
silent
and
when
the
mistress
was
in
bed
dressed
herself
in
one
of
her
silk
dresses
and
became
the
most
beautiful
woman
that
was
ever
seen
she
went
to
the
ball
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
had
entered
the
room
all
were
dazzled
she
sat
down
near
her
master
who
asked
her
to
dance
and
would
dance
with
no
one
but
her
she
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
fell
in
love
with
her
he
asked
her
who
she
was
and
where
she
came
from
she
replied
that
she
came
from
a
distance
but
told
him
nothing
more
at
a
certain
hour
without
any
one
perceiving
it
she
went
out
and
disappeared
she
returned
home
and
put
on
her
wooden
dress
again
in
the
morning
the
master
returned
from
the
ball
and
said
to
his
mother
oh
if
you
had
only
seen
what
a
beautiful
lady
there
was
at
the
ball
she
appeared
like
the
sun
she
was
so
beautiful
and
well
dressed
she
sat
down
near
me
and
would
not
dance
with
any
one
but
me
his
mother
then
said
did
you
not
ask
her
who
she
was
and
where
she
came
from
she
would
only
tell
me
that
she
came
from
a
distance
but
i
thought
i
should
die
i
wish
to
go
again
this
evening
the
servant
heard
all
this
dialogue
but
kept
silent
pretending
that
the
matter
did
not
concern
her
in
the
evening
he
prepared
himself
again
for
the
ball
and
the
servant
said
to
him
master
yesterday
evening
i
asked
your
mamma
to
let
me
too
go
to
the
ball
for
i
have
never
seen
dancing
but
she
would
not
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
let
me
go
this
evening
be
still
you
ugly
creature
the
ball
is
no
place
for
you
do
me
this
favor
she
said
weeping
i
will
stand
out
of
doors
or
under
a
bench
or
in
a
corner
so
no
one
shall
see
me
but
let
me
go
he
grew
angry
then
and
took
a
stick
and
began
to
beat
the
poor
servant
she
wept
and
remained
silent
after
he
had
gone
she
waited
until
his
mother
was
in
bed
and
put
on
a
dress
finer
than
the
first
and
so
rich
as
to
astonish
and
away
to
the
ball
when
she
arrived
all
began
to
gaze
at
her
for
they
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
all
the
handsomest
young
men
surround
her
and
ask
her
to
dance
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
one
but
her
master
he
again
asked
her
who
she
was
and
she
said
she
would
tell
him
later
they
danced
and
danced
and
all
at
once
she
disappeared
her
master
ran
here
and
there
asked
one
and
another
but
no
one
could
tell
him
where
she
had
gone
he
returned
home
and
told
his
mother
all
that
had
passed
she
said
to
him
do
you
know
what
you
must
do
take
this
diamond
ring
and
when
she
dances
with
you
give
it
to
her
and
if
she
takes
it
it
is
a
sign
that
she
loves
you
she
gave
him
the
ring
the
servant
listened
saw
everything
and
was
silent
in
the
evening
the
master
prepared
for
the
ball
and
the
servant
again
asked
him
to
take
her
and
again
he
beat
her
he
went
to
the
ball
and
after
midnight
as
before
the
beautiful
lady
returned
more
beautiful
than
before
and
as
usual
would
dance
only
with
her
master
at
the
right
moment
he
took
out
the
diamond
ring
and
asked
her
if
she
would
accept
it
she
took
it
and
thanked
him
and
he
was
happy
and
satisfied
afterward
he
asked
her
again
who
she
was
and
where
from
she
said
that
she
was
of
that
country
that
when
they
speak
of
going
to
a
ball
they
are
beaten
on
the
head
and
said
no
more
at
the
usual
hour
she
stopped
dancing
and
departed
he
ran
after
her
but
she
went
like
the
wind
and
reached
home
without
his
finding
out
where
she
went
but
he
ran
so
in
all
directions
and
was
in
such
suffering
that
when
he
reached
home
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
more
dead
than
alive
then
he
fell
ill
and
grew
worse
every
day
so
that
all
said
he
would
die
he
did
nothing
but
ask
his
mother
and
every
one
if
they
knew
anything
of
that
lady
and
that
he
would
die
if
he
did
not
see
her
the
servant
heard
everything
and
one
day
when
he
was
very
ill
what
did
she
think
of
she
waited
until
her
mistress
eye
was
turned
and
dropped
the
diamond
ring
in
the
broth
her
master
was
to
eat
no
one
saw
her
and
his
mother
took
him
the
broth
he
began
to
eat
it
when
he
felt
something
hard
saw
something
shine
and
took
it
out
you
can
imagine
how
he
looked
at
it
and
recognized
the
diamond
ring
they
thought
he
would
go
mad
he
asked
his
mother
if
that
was
the
ring
and
she
swore
that
it
was
and
all
happy
she
said
that
now
he
would
see
her
again
meanwhile
the
servant
went
to
her
room
took
off
her
wooden
dress
and
put
on
one
all
of
silk
so
that
she
appeared
a
beauty
and
went
to
the
room
of
the
sick
man
his
mother
saw
her
and
began
to
cry
here
she
is
here
she
is
she
went
in
and
saluted
him
smiling
and
he
was
so
beside
himself
that
he
became
well
at
once
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
her
story
who
she
was
where
she
came
from
how
she
came
and
how
she
knew
that
he
was
she
replied
i
am
the
woman
dressed
in
wood
who
was
your
servant
it
is
not
true
that
i
was
a
poor
girl
but
i
had
that
dress
to
conceal
myself
in
for
underneath
it
i
was
the
same
that
i
am
now
i
am
a
lady
and
although
you
treated
me
so
badly
when
i
asked
to
go
to
the
ball
i
saw
that
you
loved
me
and
now
i
have
come
to
save
you
from
death
you
can
believe
that
they
stayed
to
hear
her
story
they
were
married
and
have
always
been
happy
and
still
are
in
the
various
stories
thus
far
mentioned
which
involve
the
family
relations
we
have
had
examples
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
brothers
of
etc
it
remains
now
to
notice
the
trait
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
sister
or
mother
towards
brother
or
son
the
formula
as
given
by
hahn
no
is
as
follows
the
hero
who
is
fleeing
with
his
sister
or
mother
overcomes
a
number
of
dragons
or
giants
the
only
survivor
makes
love
to
the
sister
or
mother
and
causes
her
for
fear
of
discovery
to
send
her
brother
in
order
to
destroy
him
on
dangerous
adventures
under
the
pretence
of
obtaining
a
cure
for
her
illness
the
hero
survives
the
dangers
discovers
the
deception
and
punishes
the
guilty
ones
traces
of
this
formula
are
found
in
several
italian
stories
but
it
constitutes
only
two
entire
stories
one
in
pitrè
no
the
other
in
comparetti
no
the
golden
hair
from
monferrato
piedmont
the
latter
is
in
substance
as
follows
a
king
with
three
sons
marries
again
in
his
old
age
the
youngest
son
falls
in
love
with
his
and
the
jealous
father
tries
to
poison
her
the
son
and
wife
flee
together
and
fall
in
with
some
robbers
whom
they
kill
and
set
at
liberty
a
princess
who
has
the
gift
of
curing
blindness
and
other
diseases
they
afterward
find
a
cave
containing
rooms
and
all
the
necessaries
of
life
but
see
no
one
they
spend
the
night
there
and
the
next
morning
the
youth
goes
hunting
and
as
soon
as
he
has
departed
a
giant
appears
and
solicits
the
love
saying
that
if
she
will
marry
him
she
will
always
be
healthy
and
never
lose
her
youth
but
first
it
will
be
necessary
to
remove
from
her
head
a
golden
hair
and
then
he
will
become
so
weak
that
he
can
be
killed
by
a
blow
she
was
unwilling
at
first
because
he
had
saved
her
life
but
finally
yielded
first
she
tried
to
get
rid
of
him
by
pretending
to
be
ill
and
sending
him
for
some
water
from
a
fountain
near
which
was
a
lion
he
obtained
the
water
safely
then
his
pretending
to
comb
his
hair
cut
off
the
golden
hair
and
the
giant
dragged
him
by
the
feet
fifty
miles
and
let
him
fall
first
in
the
bushes
and
then
on
the
ground
from
the
wounds
in
his
head
he
became
blind
but
recovered
his
sight
by
means
of
the
princess
mentioned
in
the
first
part
of
the
story
whom
he
married
after
his
golden
lock
had
grown
out
again
he
returned
to
the
cave
and
killed
the
giant
punishing
his
by
leaving
her
there
without
even
looking
at
her
the
story
in
pitrè
no
the
cyclops
is
more
detailed
a
queen
who
has
been
unfaithful
to
her
husband
is
put
in
confinement
gives
birth
to
a
son
and
afterward
through
his
aid
escapes
they
encounter
some
cyclops
a
number
of
whom
the
son
kills
but
one
becomes
secretly
the
mother
lover
to
get
rid
of
her
son
she
sends
him
for
the
water
of
a
certain
fountain
which
he
brings
back
safely
finally
the
mother
binds
the
son
fast
under
the
pretence
of
playing
a
game
and
delivers
him
to
the
cyclops
who
kills
him
and
cuts
him
into
small
bits
which
he
loads
on
his
horse
and
turns
him
loose
the
youth
is
however
restored
to
life
by
the
same
water
that
he
had
brought
back
and
kills
the
cyclops
and
his
mother
finally
marrying
the
princess
to
whom
he
owes
his
life
in
marked
contrast
to
the
above
class
is
the
one
in
which
a
number
of
brothers
owe
their
deliverance
from
enchantment
to
the
of
a
sister
generally
the
sister
is
the
innocent
cause
of
her
transformation
they
live
far
from
home
and
their
sister
is
not
aware
for
a
long
time
of
their
existence
when
she
learns
it
she
departs
in
search
of
them
finds
them
and
after
great
risk
to
herself
delivers
them
but
two
versions
of
this
story
have
yet
been
published
in
italy
one
from
naples
pent
iv
the
other
from
bologna
no
the
latter
version
we
give
at
length
xi
the
curse
of
the
seven
children
there
was
once
a
king
and
a
queen
who
had
six
children
all
sons
the
queen
was
about
to
give
birth
to
another
child
and
the
king
said
that
if
it
was
not
a
daughter
all
seven
children
would
be
cursed
now
it
happened
that
the
king
had
to
go
away
to
war
and
before
departing
he
said
to
the
queen
listen
if
you
have
a
son
hang
a
lance
out
of
the
window
if
a
daughter
a
distaff
so
that
i
can
see
as
soon
as
i
arrive
which
it
is
after
the
king
had
been
gone
a
month
the
queen
gave
birth
to
the
most
beautiful
girl
that
was
ever
seen
imagine
how
pleased
the
queen
was
at
having
a
girl
she
could
scarcely
contain
herself
for
joy
and
immediately
gave
orders
to
hang
the
distaff
out
of
the
window
but
in
the
midst
of
the
joyful
confusion
a
mistake
was
made
and
they
put
out
a
lance
shortly
after
the
king
returned
and
saw
the
sign
at
the
window
and
cursed
all
his
seven
sons
but
when
he
entered
the
house
and
the
servants
crowded
around
him
to
congratulate
him
and
tell
him
about
his
beautiful
daughter
then
the
king
was
amazed
and
became
very
melancholy
he
entered
the
queen
room
and
looked
at
the
child
who
seemed
exactly
like
one
of
those
wax
dolls
to
be
kept
in
a
box
then
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
nothing
of
his
sons
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
for
those
poor
youths
had
wandered
out
into
the
world
meanwhile
the
girl
grew
and
when
she
was
large
she
saw
that
her
parents
caressed
her
but
always
with
tears
in
their
eyes
one
day
she
said
to
her
mother
what
is
the
matter
with
you
mother
that
i
always
see
you
crying
then
the
queen
told
her
the
story
and
said
that
she
was
afraid
that
some
day
she
would
see
her
disappear
too
when
the
girl
heard
how
it
was
what
did
she
do
one
night
she
rose
softly
and
left
the
palace
with
the
intention
of
going
to
find
her
brothers
she
walked
and
walked
and
at
last
met
a
little
old
man
who
said
to
her
where
are
you
going
at
this
time
of
the
night
she
answered
i
am
in
search
of
my
brothers
the
old
man
said
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
them
for
you
must
not
speak
for
seven
years
seven
months
seven
weeks
seven
days
seven
hours
and
seven
minutes
she
said
i
will
try
then
she
took
a
bit
of
paper
which
she
found
on
the
ground
wrote
on
it
the
day
and
the
hour
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
and
left
the
old
man
and
hastened
on
her
way
after
she
had
run
a
long
time
she
saw
a
light
and
went
towards
it
and
when
she
was
near
it
she
saw
that
it
was
over
the
door
of
a
palace
where
a
king
lived
she
entered
and
sat
down
on
the
stairway
and
fell
asleep
the
servants
came
later
to
put
out
the
light
and
saw
the
pretty
girl
asleep
on
the
stone
steps
they
awakened
her
asking
her
what
she
was
doing
there
she
began
to
make
signs
asking
them
to
give
her
a
lodging
they
understood
her
and
said
they
would
ask
the
king
they
returned
shortly
to
tell
her
to
enter
for
the
king
wished
to
see
her
before
she
was
shown
to
her
room
when
the
king
saw
the
beautiful
girl
with
hair
like
gold
flesh
like
milk
and
wine
teeth
white
as
pearls
and
little
hands
that
an
artist
could
not
paint
as
beautiful
as
they
were
he
suddenly
imagined
that
she
must
be
the
daughter
of
some
lord
and
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
treated
with
all
possible
respect
they
showed
her
to
a
beautiful
room
then
a
maid
came
and
undressed
her
and
put
her
to
bed
next
morning
diana
for
so
she
was
called
arose
saw
a
frame
with
a
piece
of
embroidery
in
it
and
began
to
work
at
it
the
king
visited
her
and
asked
if
she
needed
anything
and
she
made
signs
that
she
did
not
the
king
was
so
pleased
with
the
young
girl
that
he
ended
by
falling
in
love
with
her
and
after
a
year
had
passed
he
thought
of
marrying
her
the
who
was
an
envious
person
was
not
content
with
the
match
because
said
she
no
one
knows
where
she
came
from
and
besides
she
is
dumb
something
that
would
make
people
wonder
if
a
king
should
marry
her
but
the
king
was
so
obstinate
that
he
married
her
and
when
his
mother
saw
that
there
was
no
help
she
pretended
to
be
satisfied
shortly
after
the
put
into
the
king
hands
a
letter
which
informed
him
of
an
imminent
war
in
which
if
he
did
not
take
part
he
would
run
the
risk
of
losing
his
realm
the
king
went
to
the
war
in
fact
with
great
grief
at
leaving
his
wife
and
before
departing
he
commended
her
earnestly
to
his
mother
who
said
do
not
be
anxious
my
son
i
shall
do
all
that
i
can
to
make
her
happy
the
king
embraced
his
wife
and
mother
and
departed
scarcely
had
the
king
gone
when
the
sent
for
a
mason
and
made
him
build
a
wall
near
the
so
that
it
formed
a
sort
of
box
now
you
must
know
that
diana
expected
soon
to
become
a
mother
and
this
afforded
the
a
pretext
to
write
to
her
son
that
his
wife
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
child
she
took
her
and
put
her
in
the
wall
she
had
had
built
where
there
was
neither
light
nor
air
and
where
the
wicked
woman
hoped
that
she
would
die
but
it
was
not
so
the
scullion
went
every
day
to
wash
the
dishes
at
the
sink
near
where
poor
diana
was
buried
alive
while
attending
to
his
business
he
heard
a
lamentation
and
listened
to
see
where
it
could
come
from
he
listened
and
listened
until
at
last
he
perceived
that
the
voice
came
from
the
wall
that
had
been
newly
built
what
did
he
do
then
he
made
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
saw
that
the
queen
was
there
the
scullion
asked
how
she
came
there
but
she
only
made
signs
that
she
was
about
to
give
birth
to
a
child
the
poor
scullion
had
his
wife
make
a
fine
cushion
on
which
diana
reposed
as
well
as
she
could
and
gave
birth
to
the
most
beautiful
boy
that
could
be
seen
the
scullion
wife
went
to
see
her
every
moment
and
carried
her
broth
and
cared
for
the
child
in
short
this
poor
woman
as
well
as
her
husband
did
everything
she
could
to
alleviate
the
poor
queen
who
tried
to
make
them
understand
by
signs
what
she
needed
one
day
it
came
into
diana
head
to
look
into
her
memorandum
book
and
see
how
long
she
still
had
to
keep
silent
and
she
saw
that
only
two
minutes
yet
remained
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
she
told
the
scullion
all
that
had
happened
at
that
moment
the
king
arrived
and
the
scullion
drew
the
queen
from
out
the
hole
and
showed
her
to
the
king
you
can
imagine
how
delighted
he
was
to
see
again
his
diana
whom
he
believed
to
be
dead
he
embraced
her
and
kissed
her
and
the
child
in
short
such
was
his
joy
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
go
mad
diana
related
everything
to
him
why
she
had
left
her
home
and
why
she
had
played
dumb
so
long
and
finally
how
she
had
been
treated
by
the
and
what
she
had
suffered
and
how
kind
those
poor
people
had
been
to
her
when
he
had
heard
all
this
he
said
leave
the
matter
to
me
i
will
arrange
it
the
next
day
the
king
invited
all
the
nobles
and
princes
of
his
realm
to
a
great
banquet
now
it
happened
that
in
setting
the
tables
the
servants
laid
six
plates
besides
the
others
and
when
the
guests
sat
down
six
handsome
youths
entered
who
advanced
and
asked
what
should
be
given
to
a
sister
who
had
done
so
and
so
for
her
brothers
then
the
king
sprang
up
and
said
and
i
ask
what
shall
be
done
to
a
mother
who
did
so
and
so
to
her
son
wife
and
he
explained
everything
one
said
burn
her
alive
another
put
her
in
the
pillory
another
fry
her
in
oil
in
the
public
square
this
was
agreed
to
the
youths
had
been
informed
by
that
same
old
man
whom
diana
had
met
and
who
was
a
magician
where
their
sister
was
and
what
she
had
done
for
them
then
they
made
themselves
known
and
embraced
diana
and
their
the
king
and
after
the
greatest
joy
they
all
started
off
to
see
their
parents
imagine
the
satisfaction
of
the
king
and
queen
at
seeing
again
all
their
seven
children
they
gave
the
warmest
reception
to
the
king
husband
and
after
they
had
spent
some
days
together
diana
returned
with
her
husband
to
their
city
and
all
lived
there
afterward
in
peace
and
contentment
we
shall
now
turn
our
attention
to
another
story
which
may
be
termed
the
true
bride
although
the
grimm
story
of
that
name
is
not
a
representative
of
it
one
of
the
simplest
versions
is
grimm
the
in
which
a
queen
daughter
is
betrothed
to
a
king
son
who
lives
far
away
when
the
daughter
grew
up
she
was
sent
to
the
bridegroom
with
a
maid
to
wait
upon
her
on
the
journey
the
maid
takes
the
place
of
the
princess
who
becomes
a
poor
the
true
bride
is
of
course
discovered
at
last
and
the
false
one
duly
punished
the
white
and
the
black
bride
of
the
same
collection
is
a
more
complicated
version
of
the
same
theme
the
first
part
is
the
story
of
two
sisters
who
receive
different
gifts
from
fairies
etc
the
second
part
that
of
the
brother
who
paints
his
portrait
which
the
king
sees
and
desires
to
marry
the
original
the
sister
is
sent
for
but
on
the
journey
the
ugly
pushes
the
bride
into
a
river
or
the
sea
and
takes
her
place
the
true
bride
is
changed
into
a
swan
or
otherwise
miraculously
preserved
and
at
last
resumes
her
lawful
place
in
the
above
stories
the
substitution
of
the
false
bride
is
the
main
incident
in
the
story
but
there
are
many
other
tales
in
which
the
same
incident
occurs
but
it
is
subordinate
to
the
others
examples
of
this
latter
class
will
be
given
as
soon
as
we
reach
the
story
of
the
forgotten
bride
the
first
class
mentioned
is
represented
in
italy
by
two
versions
also
the
first
is
composed
of
the
two
traits
two
sisters
and
true
bride
the
second
of
brother
who
shows
beautiful
sister
portrait
to
king
this
second
version
sometimes
shows
traces
of
the
first
it
is
with
this
second
version
that
we
now
have
to
do
as
in
it
only
is
the
substitution
of
the
false
bride
the
main
incident
examples
of
the
first
version
will
be
found
in
the
notes
the
story
we
have
selected
to
illustrate
the
second
version
of
this
story
is
from
florence
and
is
entitled
xii
oraggio
and
bianchinetta
there
was
once
a
lady
who
had
two
children
the
boy
was
called
oraggio
the
girl
bianchinetta
by
misfortunes
they
were
reduced
from
great
wealth
to
poverty
it
was
decided
that
oraggio
should
go
out
to
service
and
indeed
he
found
a
situation
as
de
to
a
prince
after
a
time
the
prince
satisfied
with
his
service
changed
it
and
set
him
to
work
cleaning
the
pictures
in
his
gallery
among
the
various
paintings
was
one
of
a
very
beautiful
lady
which
was
constantly
oraggio
admiration
the
prince
often
surprised
him
admiring
the
portrait
one
day
he
asked
him
why
he
spent
so
much
time
before
that
picture
oraggio
replied
that
it
was
the
very
image
of
his
sister
and
having
been
away
from
her
some
time
he
felt
the
need
of
seeing
her
again
the
prince
answered
that
he
did
not
believe
that
picture
resembled
his
sister
because
he
had
a
search
made
and
it
had
not
been
possible
to
find
any
lady
like
the
portrait
he
added
have
her
come
here
and
if
she
is
as
beautiful
as
you
say
i
will
make
her
my
wife
oraggio
wrote
at
once
to
bianchinetta
who
immediately
set
out
on
her
journey
oraggio
went
to
the
harbor
to
await
her
and
when
he
perceived
the
ship
at
a
distance
he
called
out
at
intervals
mariners
of
the
high
sea
guard
my
sister
bianchina
so
that
the
sun
shall
not
brown
her
now
on
the
ship
where
bianchinetta
was
was
also
another
young
girl
with
her
mother
both
very
homely
when
they
were
near
the
harbor
the
daughter
gave
bianchinetta
a
blow
and
pushed
her
into
the
sea
when
they
landed
oraggio
could
not
recognize
his
sister
and
that
homely
girl
presented
herself
saying
that
the
sun
had
made
her
so
dark
that
she
could
no
longer
be
recognized
the
prince
was
surprised
at
seeing
such
a
homely
woman
and
reproved
oraggio
removing
him
from
his
position
and
setting
him
to
watch
the
geese
every
day
he
led
the
geese
to
the
sea
and
every
day
bianchinetta
came
forth
and
adorned
them
with
tassels
of
various
colors
when
the
geese
returned
home
they
said
crò
crò
from
the
sea
we
come
we
feed
on
gold
and
pearls
oraggio
sister
is
fair
she
is
fair
as
the
sun
she
would
suit
our
master
well
the
prince
asked
oraggio
how
the
geese
came
to
repeat
those
words
every
day
he
told
him
that
his
sister
thrown
into
the
sea
had
been
seized
by
a
fish
which
had
taken
her
to
a
beautiful
palace
under
the
water
where
she
was
in
chains
but
that
attached
to
a
long
chain
she
was
permitted
to
come
to
the
shore
when
he
drove
the
geese
there
the
prince
said
if
what
you
relate
is
true
ask
her
what
is
required
to
liberate
her
from
that
prison
the
next
day
oraggio
asked
bianchinetta
how
it
would
be
possible
to
take
her
from
there
and
conduct
her
to
the
prince
she
replied
it
is
impossible
to
take
me
from
here
at
least
the
monster
always
says
to
me
would
require
a
sword
that
cuts
like
a
hundred
and
a
horse
that
runs
like
the
wind
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
these
two
things
you
see
therefore
it
is
my
fate
to
remain
here
always
oraggio
returned
to
the
palace
and
informed
the
prince
of
his
sister
answer
the
latter
made
every
effort
and
succeeded
in
finding
the
horse
that
ran
like
the
wind
and
the
sword
that
cut
like
a
hundred
they
went
to
the
sea
found
bianchinetta
who
was
awaiting
them
she
led
them
to
her
palace
with
the
sword
the
chain
was
cut
she
mounted
the
horse
and
thus
was
able
to
escape
when
they
reached
the
palace
the
prince
found
her
as
beautiful
as
the
portrait
oraggio
was
always
gazing
at
and
married
her
the
other
homely
one
was
burned
in
the
public
square
with
the
accustomed
and
they
lived
content
and
happy
we
have
already
encountered
the
trait
of
thankful
animals
who
assist
the
hero
in
return
for
kindness
he
has
shown
them
what
is
merely
an
incident
in
the
stories
above
alluded
to
constitutes
the
main
feature
of
a
class
of
stories
which
may
be
termed
animal
the
usual
formula
in
these
stories
is
as
follows
three
princes
transformed
into
animals
marry
the
hero
sisters
the
hero
visits
them
in
turn
they
assist
him
in
the
performance
of
difficult
tasks
and
are
by
him
freed
from
their
enchantment
this
formula
varies
of
course
sometimes
there
are
but
two
sisters
and
the
are
freed
from
their
enchantment
in
some
other
way
than
by
the
hero
a
good
specimen
of
this
class
is
from
the
south
of
italy
basilicata
comparetti
no
and
is
called
xiii
the
fair
fiorita
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
four
children
three
daughters
and
a
son
who
was
the
heir
to
the
throne
one
day
the
king
said
to
the
prince
my
son
i
have
decided
to
marry
your
three
sisters
to
the
first
persons
who
pass
our
palace
at
noon
at
that
time
there
first
passed
a
then
a
huntsman
and
finally
a
the
king
had
them
all
three
summoned
to
his
presence
and
told
the
that
he
wished
to
give
him
his
oldest
daughter
for
a
wife
the
second
to
the
huntsman
and
the
third
to
the
those
poor
creatures
thought
they
were
dreaming
but
they
saw
that
the
king
spoke
seriously
or
rather
commanded
then
all
confused
but
well
pleased
they
said
let
your
majesty
will
be
done
the
prince
who
loved
his
youngest
sister
dearly
was
deeply
grieved
that
she
should
become
a
wife
he
begged
the
king
not
to
make
this
match
but
the
king
would
not
listen
to
him
the
prince
grieved
at
his
father
caprice
would
not
be
present
at
his
sisters
wedding
but
took
a
walk
in
the
garden
at
the
foot
of
the
palace
now
while
the
priest
in
the
marriage
hall
was
blessing
the
three
brides
the
garden
suddenly
bloomed
with
the
fairest
flowers
and
there
came
forth
from
a
white
cloud
a
voice
which
said
happy
he
who
shall
have
a
kiss
from
the
lips
of
the
fair
fiorita
the
prince
trembled
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
and
afterward
leaning
against
an
he
began
to
weep
for
the
sisters
he
had
lost
and
remained
buried
in
thought
many
hours
then
he
started
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
and
said
to
himself
i
must
flee
from
my
father
house
i
will
wander
about
the
world
and
will
not
rest
until
i
have
a
kiss
from
the
lips
of
the
fair
fiorita
he
travelled
over
land
and
sea
over
mountains
and
plains
and
found
no
living
soul
that
could
give
him
word
of
the
fair
fiorita
three
years
had
elapsed
when
one
day
leaving
a
wood
and
journeying
through
a
beautiful
plain
he
arrived
at
a
palace
before
which
was
a
fountain
and
drew
near
to
drink
a
child
two
years
old
who
was
playing
by
the
fountain
seeing
him
approach
began
to
cry
and
call
its
mother
the
mother
when
she
saw
the
prince
ran
to
meet
him
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
crying
welcome
welcome
my
brother
the
prince
at
first
did
not
recognize
her
but
looking
at
her
closely
in
the
face
he
saw
that
it
was
his
oldest
sister
and
embracing
her
in
turn
exclaimed
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
my
sister
and
they
rejoiced
greatly
the
sister
invited
him
to
enter
the
palace
which
was
hers
and
led
him
to
her
husband
who
was
much
pleased
to
see
him
and
all
three
overwhelmed
with
caresses
the
child
who
by
calling
his
mother
had
been
the
cause
of
all
that
joy
the
prince
then
asked
about
his
other
two
sisters
and
his
replied
that
they
were
well
and
lived
in
a
lordly
way
with
their
husbands
the
prince
was
surprised
and
his
added
that
the
fortunes
of
the
three
husbands
of
his
sisters
had
changed
since
they
had
been
enchanted
by
a
magician
and
can
not
i
see
my
other
two
sisters
asked
the
prince
the
replied
direct
your
journey
towards
sunrise
after
a
day
you
will
find
your
second
sister
after
two
days
the
third
but
i
must
seek
the
way
to
the
fair
fiorita
and
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
towards
sunrise
or
sunset
it
is
precisely
towards
sunrise
and
you
are
doubly
fortunate
first
because
you
will
see
your
two
sisters
again
secondly
because
from
the
last
you
can
receive
information
about
the
fair
fiorita
but
before
departing
i
wish
to
give
you
a
remembrance
take
these
hog
bristles
the
first
time
you
encounter
any
danger
from
which
you
can
not
extricate
yourself
throw
them
on
the
ground
and
i
will
free
you
from
the
danger
the
prince
took
the
bristles
and
after
he
had
thanked
his
resumed
his
journey
the
next
day
he
arrived
at
the
palace
of
his
second
sister
was
received
there
also
with
great
joy
and
this
too
wished
to
give
him
a
memento
before
he
departed
and
because
he
had
been
a
huntsman
presented
him
with
a
bunch
of
birds
feathers
telling
him
the
same
thing
that
the
other
had
he
thanked
him
and
departed
the
third
day
he
came
to
his
youngest
sister
who
seeing
the
brother
who
had
always
loved
her
more
dearly
than
his
other
sisters
welcomed
him
more
warmly
as
did
also
her
husband
the
latter
gave
him
a
little
human
bone
giving
him
the
same
advice
as
the
other
had
his
sister
then
told
him
that
the
fair
fiorita
lived
a
day
journey
from
there
and
that
he
could
learn
more
about
her
from
an
old
woman
who
was
indebted
to
her
and
to
whom
she
sent
him
as
soon
as
the
prince
arrived
at
the
fair
fiorita
country
she
was
the
king
daughter
he
went
to
the
old
woman
when
she
heard
that
he
was
the
brother
of
the
one
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
she
received
him
like
a
son
fortunately
the
old
woman
house
was
exactly
opposite
that
side
of
the
king
palace
where
there
was
a
window
to
which
the
fair
fiorita
came
every
day
at
dawn
now
one
morning
at
that
hour
she
appeared
at
the
window
scarcely
covered
by
a
white
veil
when
the
prince
saw
that
flower
of
beauty
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
would
have
fallen
had
not
the
old
woman
supported
him
the
old
woman
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
the
idea
of
marrying
the
fair
fiorita
saying
that
the
king
would
give
his
daughter
only
to
him
who
should
discover
a
hidden
place
and
that
he
killed
him
who
could
not
find
it
and
that
already
many
princes
had
lost
their
lives
for
her
but
notwithstanding
he
answered
that
he
should
die
if
he
could
not
obtain
possession
of
the
fair
fiorita
having
learned
afterward
from
the
old
woman
that
the
king
bought
for
his
daughter
the
rarest
musical
instruments
hear
what
he
devised
he
went
to
a
and
said
i
want
a
cymbal
that
will
play
three
tunes
and
each
tune
to
last
a
day
and
to
be
made
in
such
a
way
that
a
man
can
be
hidden
inside
of
it
and
i
will
pay
you
a
thousand
ducats
for
it
when
it
is
finished
i
will
get
in
it
and
you
must
go
and
play
it
in
front
of
the
king
palace
and
if
the
king
wishes
to
buy
it
you
will
sell
it
to
him
on
condition
that
you
shall
take
it
every
three
days
to
fix
it
the
consented
and
did
all
that
the
prince
commanded
him
the
king
purchased
the
cymbal
with
the
condition
had
it
carried
to
his
daughter
and
said
to
her
see
my
daughter
i
do
not
wish
you
to
lack
any
diversion
even
when
you
are
in
bed
and
can
not
sleep
next
to
the
fair
fiorita
chamber
slept
her
maids
of
honor
in
the
night
when
all
were
asleep
the
prince
who
was
hidden
in
the
cymbal
came
out
and
called
fair
fiorita
fair
fiorita
she
awoke
in
a
fright
and
cried
come
my
maids
of
honor
i
hear
some
one
calling
me
the
maids
of
honor
came
quickly
but
found
no
one
for
the
prince
hid
himself
suddenly
in
the
instrument
the
same
thing
happened
twice
and
the
maids
coming
and
finding
no
one
the
fair
fiorita
said
well
it
must
be
my
fancy
if
i
call
you
again
do
not
come
i
command
you
the
prince
within
the
cymbal
heard
this
scarcely
had
the
maids
of
honor
fallen
asleep
again
when
the
prince
approached
the
fair
one
bed
and
said
fair
fiorita
give
me
i
beg
you
a
kiss
from
your
lips
if
you
do
not
i
shall
die
she
all
trembling
called
her
maids
but
obeying
her
command
they
did
not
come
then
she
said
to
the
prince
you
are
fortunate
and
have
won
draw
near
and
she
gave
him
the
kiss
and
on
the
prince
lips
there
remained
a
beautiful
rose
take
this
rose
she
said
and
keep
it
on
your
heart
for
it
will
bring
you
good
luck
the
prince
placed
it
on
his
heart
and
then
told
his
fair
one
all
his
history
from
the
time
he
had
left
his
father
palace
until
he
had
introduced
himself
into
her
chamber
by
the
trick
with
the
cymbal
the
fair
fiorita
was
well
pleased
and
said
that
she
would
willingly
marry
him
but
to
succeed
he
must
perform
many
difficult
tasks
which
the
king
would
lay
upon
him
first
he
must
discover
the
way
to
a
where
the
king
had
concealed
her
with
a
hundred
damsels
then
he
must
recognize
her
among
the
hundred
damsels
all
dressed
alike
and
veiled
but
she
said
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
these
difficulties
for
the
rose
you
have
taken
from
my
lips
and
which
you
will
always
wear
over
your
heart
will
draw
you
like
the
loadstone
first
to
the
and
afterward
to
my
arms
but
the
king
will
set
you
other
tasks
and
perhaps
terrible
ones
these
you
must
think
of
yourself
let
us
leave
it
to
god
and
fortune
the
prince
went
at
once
to
the
king
and
asked
for
the
fair
hand
the
king
did
not
refuse
it
but
made
the
same
conditions
that
the
princess
had
told
him
of
he
consented
and
by
the
help
of
the
rose
quickly
performed
the
first
tasks
bravo
exclaimed
the
king
when
the
prince
recognized
the
fair
fiorita
among
the
other
damsels
but
this
is
not
enough
then
he
shut
him
up
in
a
large
room
all
full
of
fruit
and
commanded
him
under
pain
of
death
to
eat
it
all
up
in
a
day
the
prince
was
in
despair
but
fortunately
he
remembered
the
hog
bristles
and
the
advice
which
his
first
had
given
him
he
threw
the
bristles
on
the
ground
and
there
suddenly
came
forth
a
great
herd
of
swine
which
ate
up
all
the
fruit
and
then
disappeared
this
task
was
accomplished
but
the
king
proposed
another
he
wished
the
prince
to
retire
with
his
bride
and
cause
her
to
fall
asleep
at
the
singing
of
the
birds
which
are
the
sweetest
to
hear
and
the
most
beautiful
to
see
the
prince
remembered
the
bunch
of
feathers
given
him
by
his
the
huntsman
and
threw
them
on
the
ground
suddenly
there
appeared
the
most
beautiful
birds
in
the
world
and
sang
so
sweetly
that
the
king
himself
fell
asleep
but
a
servant
awakened
him
at
once
because
he
had
commanded
it
and
he
said
to
the
prince
and
his
daughter
now
you
can
enjoy
your
love
at
liberty
but
on
arising
you
must
present
me
with
a
child
two
years
old
who
can
speak
and
call
you
by
name
if
not
you
will
both
be
killed
now
let
us
retire
my
dear
wife
said
the
prince
to
the
fair
fiorita
between
now
and
some
saint
will
aid
us
the
next
morning
the
prince
remembered
the
bone
which
his
the
had
given
him
he
rose
and
threw
it
to
the
ground
and
lo
a
beautiful
child
with
a
golden
apple
in
his
right
hand
who
cried
papa
and
mamma
the
king
entered
the
room
and
the
child
ran
to
meet
him
and
wished
to
put
the
golden
apple
on
the
crown
which
the
king
wore
the
king
then
kissed
the
child
blessed
the
pair
and
taking
the
crown
from
his
head
put
it
on
his
saying
this
is
now
yours
then
they
gave
a
great
feast
at
the
court
for
the
wedding
and
they
invited
the
prince
three
sisters
with
their
husbands
and
the
prince
father
receiving
such
good
news
of
the
son
whom
he
believed
lost
hastened
to
embrace
him
and
gave
him
his
crown
too
so
the
prince
and
the
fair
fiorita
became
king
and
queen
of
two
realms
and
from
that
time
on
were
always
happy
in
the
above
story
the
wife
is
won
by
the
performance
of
difficult
tasks
by
the
suitor
a
somewhat
similar
class
of
stories
is
the
one
in
which
the
bride
is
won
by
the
solution
of
a
riddle
the
riddle
or
difficult
question
is
either
proposed
by
the
bride
herself
and
the
suitor
who
fails
to
answer
it
is
killed
or
the
suitor
is
obliged
to
propose
one
himself
and
if
the
bride
fails
to
solve
it
she
marries
him
if
she
succeeds
the
suitor
is
killed
the
first
of
the
above
two
forms
is
found
in
three
italian
stories
two
of
which
resemble
each
other
quite
closely
in
the
pentamerone
i
the
flea
the
king
of
being
bitten
by
a
flea
caught
him
by
a
wonderful
feat
of
dexterity
and
seeing
how
handsome
and
stately
he
was
he
could
not
in
conscience
pass
sentence
on
him
upon
the
bed
of
his
nail
so
he
put
him
into
a
bottle
and
feeding
him
every
day
with
the
blood
of
his
own
arm
the
little
beast
grew
at
such
a
rate
that
at
the
end
of
seven
months
it
was
necessary
to
shift
his
quarters
for
he
was
grown
bigger
than
a
sheep
when
the
king
saw
this
he
had
him
flayed
and
the
skin
dressed
then
he
issued
a
proclamation
that
whoever
could
tell
to
what
animal
this
skin
had
belonged
should
have
his
daughter
to
wife
the
question
is
answered
by
an
ogre
to
whom
the
king
gives
his
daughter
rather
than
break
his
promise
the
hapless
wife
is
afterward
rescued
by
an
old
woman
seven
sons
who
possess
remarkable
gifts

kills
for
the
same
reason
and
marries
the
youngest
she
is
more
discreet
and
the
witch
head
can
only
praise
her
one
day
she
finds
the
head
and
throws
it
in
the
oven
and
the
robber
whose
life
was
in
some
way
connected
with
it
died
the
wife
then
anointed
her
sisters
with
a
salve
and
all
three
returned
to
their
father
house
and
afterward
married
three
handsome
princes
the
third
story
from
the
tyrol
schneller
no
the
devil
wife
is
connected
with
the
bluebeard
story
which
will
be
mentioned
later
a
king
and
queen
had
an
only
daughter
who
was
very
pretty
and
fond
of
dress
one
day
she
found
a
louse
and
as
she
did
not
know
what
kind
of
an
animal
it
was
she
ran
to
her
mother
and
asked
her
her
mother
told
her
and
said
shut
the
louse
up
in
a
box
and
feed
it
as
soon
as
it
is
very
large
we
will
have
a
pair
of
gloves
made
of
its
skin
these
we
will
exhibit
and
whoever
of
your
suitors
guesses
from
the
skin
of
what
animal
they
are
made
shall
be
your
husband
the
successful
suitor
is
no
other
than
the
devil
who
takes
his
wife
home
and
forbids
her
to
open
a
certain
room
one
day
while
he
is
absent
she
opens
the
door
of
the
forbidden
chamber
and
sees
from
the
flames
and
condemned
souls
who
her
husband
is

is
so
frightened
that
she
becomes
ill
but
manages
to
send
word
to
her
father
by
means
of
a
the
king
sets
out
with
many
brave
men
to
deliver
her
on
the
way
he
meets
three
men
who
possess
wonderful
gifts
far
seeing
sharp
ear
great
strength
and
with
their
aid
rescues
his
daughter
more
frequently
however
this
class
of
stories
turns
on
a
riddle
proposed
by
the
suitor
himself
and
which
the
bride
is
unable
to
solve
the
following
story
which
illustrates
the
latter
version
is
from
istria
ive
and
is
entitled
xiv
bierde
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
mother
who
had
a
son
who
went
to
school
one
day
he
came
home
and
said
to
his
mother

want
to

he
had
a
dog
whose
name
was
bierde
he
said
morning

into
a
bag

a
pair
of
iron
shoes

fortune
his
mother
said

and
she
wept
him
as
dead
after
she
was
quieted
she
said
to
him

will
bake

she
made
the
and
put
some
poison
in
it
she
put
the
bread
and
the
in
the
bag
and
he
went
away
he
walked
and
walked
and
walked
until
he
felt
hungry
and
said
to
the
dog
ah
poor
bierde
how
tired
you
are
and
how
hungry
too
wait
until
we
have
gone
a
little
farther
and
then
we
will
eat
he
went
on
tired
as
he
was
and
at
last
seated
himself
under
a
tree
with
the
dog
near
him
he
said
oh

we
are
now
we
will
eat
wait
bierde
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
the
so
that
you
too
can
eat
he
broke
off
a
piece
of
the
cake
and
gave
it
to
him
to
eat
the
dog
was
so
hungry
that
he
ate
it
greedily
after
he
had
eaten
it
he
took
two
or
three
turns
and
fell
dead
on
the
ground
with
his
tongue
sticking
out
ah
poor
bierde
said
his
master
you
have
been
poisoned
my
mother
has
done
it
the
wretch
she
has
put
poison
in
the
cake
in
order
to
kill
me
he
kept
weeping
and
saying
poor
bierde
you
are
dead
but
you
have
saved
my
life
while
he
was
weeping
three
crows
passed
alighted
and
pecked
at
the
tongue
of
the
dog
and
all
three
died
then
he
said
well
well
dead
has
killed
three
crows
i
will
take
them
with
me
so
he
took
them
and
continued
his
journey
he
saw
at
a
distance
a
large
fire
he
approached
and
heard
talking
and
singing
and
beheld
seven
highwaymen
who
had
eaten
a
great
many
birds
and
who
had
a
great
deal
of
meat
still
left
he
said
to
himself
poor
me
now
i
shall
have
to
die
there
is
no
escape
they
will
certainly
take
me
and
kill
me
then
he
said
enough
i
will
go
ahead
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
they
cried
stop
your
money
or
your
life
the
poor
fellow
said
brothers
what
would
you
have
me
give
you
money
i
have
not
i
am
very
hungry
i
have
nothing
but
these
three
birds
if
you
want
them
i
will
give
them
to
you
very
well
they
said
eat
and
drink
we
will
eat
the
birds
they
took
the
birds
picked
them
skinned
them
roasted
them
over
the
coals
and
said
to
the
youth
we
will
not
give
you
any
of
these
you
can
eat
the
others
they
ate
them
and
all
seven
fell
down
dead
when
the
youth
saw
that
they
did
not
stir
but
were
dead
he
said
well
well
dead
has
killed
three
and
these
three
have
killed
seven
he
rose
and
went
away
after
he
had
made
a
good
meal
on
the
way
he
felt
hungry
again
and
sat
down
under
a
tree
and
began
to
eat
when
he
got
up
he
saw
a
beautiful
on
the
top
of
another
tree
he
took
up
a
stone
and
threw
at
it
the
bird
flew
away
now
behind
this
tree
was
a
hare
big
with
young
and
it
happened
that
the
stone
fell
on
it
and
killed
it
the
youth
went
to
see
where
the
stone
fell
and
when
he
saw
the
dead
hare
he
said
well
well
threw
it
at
the
and
the
stone
killed
the
hare
i
will
take
it
with
me
if
i
had
the
fire
that
those
robbers
left
i
would
cook
it
he
went
on
until
he
came
to
a
church
in
which
he
found
a
lighted
lamp
and
a
missal
so
he
skinned
the
hare
and
made
a
fire
with
the
missal
and
roasted
and
ate
the
hare
then
he
continued
his
journey
until
he
came
to
the
foot
of
a
mountain
where
the
sea
was
on
the
shore
he
saw
two
persons
with
a
boat
who
ferried
over
those
who
wished
to
reach
the
other
shore
because
one
could
not
go
on
foot
on
account
of
the
great
dust
which
was
suffocating
the
price
for
crossing
was
three
the
youth
said
to
the
owners
of
the
bark
how
much
do
you
want
to
set
me
down
on
the
other
bank
three
take
me
across
brothers
i
will
give
you
two
for
i
have
no
more
they
replied
do
not
enter
if
there
are
not
he
repeated
his
offer
and
they
made
the
same
answer
then
he
said
very
well
i
will
stay
here
and
he
remained
there
in
a
moment
however
there
came
up
a
shower
and
laid
the
dust
and
he
went
on
he
reached
a
city
and
found
it
in
great
confusion
he
asked
what
is
the
matter
here
that
there
are
so
many
people
they
answered
it
is
the
governor
daughter
who
guesses
everything
he
whose
riddle
she
can
not
guess
is
to
marry
her
but
he
whose
riddle
she
guesses
is
put
to
death
he
asked
could
i
too
go
there
what
you
go
who
are
a
foolish
boy
so
many
students
have
abstained
and
you
so
ignorant
wish
to
go
you
will
certainly
go
to
your
death
well
he
said
my
mother
told
me
that
she
would
never
see
me
again
so
i
will
go
he
presented
himself
to
the
governor
and
said
sir
governor
i
wish
to
go
to
your
daughter
and
see
whether
she
can
guess
what
i
have
to
tell
her
do
you
wish
he
replied
to
go
to
your
death
so
many
have
lost
their
lives
do
you
also
wish
to
lose
yours
he
answered
let
me
go
and
try
he
wished
to
go
and
see
for
himself
he
entered
the
hall
where
the
daughter
was
the
governor
summoned
many
gentlemen
to
hear
when
they
were
all
there
the
governor
again
said
that
the
youth
should
reflect
that
if
she
guessed
what
he
had
to
say
that
he
would
lose
his
life
he
replied
that
he
had
thought
of
that
the
room
was
full
of
persons
of
talent
and
the
youth
presented
himself
and
said
bierde
dead
has
killed
three
she
said
to
herself
how
can
it
be
that
one
dead
should
kill
three
and
three
have
killed
seven
she
said
here
is
nothing
but
dead
and
killed
what
shall
i
do
she
was
puzzled
at
once
and
felt
herself
perplexed
he
continued
i
threw
where
i
saw
and
reached
where
i
did
not
expect
to
i
have
eaten
that
which
was
born
and
that
which
was
not
born
it
was
cooked
with
words
two
do
not
enter
if
there
are
not
three
but
the
hard
passes
over
the
soft
when
she
heard
this
the
governor
daughter
could
not
answer
all
the
others
were
astonished
likewise
and
said
that
she
must
marry
him
then
he
told
them
all
that
had
happened
and
the
marriage
took
place
we
shall
now
direct
our
attention
to
a
class
of
stories
found
in
all
lands
and
which
may
from
one
of
its
most
important
episodes
be
called
the
forgotten
bride
in
the
ordinary
version
the
hero
in
consequence
of
some
imprecation
sets
out
in
search
of
the
heroine
who
is
either
the
daughter
or
in
the
custody
of
ogre
or
ogress
the
hero
by
the
help
of
the
heroine
performs
difficult
tasks
imposed
upon
him
by
her
father
or
mother
and
finally
elopes
with
her
the
pursuit
of
father
or
mother
is
avoided
by
magic
obstacles
raised
in
their
way
or
by
transformations
of
the
fugitives
the
hero
leaves
his
bride
to
prepare
his
parents
to
receive
her
but
at
a
kiss
usually
from
his
mother
he
entirely
forgets
his
bride
until
she
recalls
herself
to
his
memory
and
they
are
both
united
the
trait
of
difficult
tasks
performed
by
the
hero
is
sometimes
omitted
as
well
as
flight
with
magic
obstacles
or
transformations
all
the
episodes
of
the
above
story
down
to
the
forgetting
bride
at
mother
kiss
are
found
in
many
stories
notably
in
the
class
true
bride
already
mentioned
a
sicilian
story
pitrè
no
will
best
illustrate
this
class
it
is
entitled
xv
there
was
once
a
king
and
queen
who
had
no
son
and
they
were
always
making
vows
to
obtain
one
and
they
promised
that
if
they
had
a
son
or
even
a
daughter
they
would
maintain
two
fountains
for
seven
years
one
running
wine
the
other
oil
after
this
vow
the
queen
gave
birth
to
a
handsome
boy
as
soon
as
the
child
was
born
the
two
fountains
were
erected
and
everybody
went
and
took
oil
and
wine
at
the
end
of
seven
years
the
fountains
began
to
dry
up
an
ogress
wishing
to
collect
the
drops
that
still
fell
from
the
fountain
went
there
with
a
sponge
and
pitcher
she
sopped
up
the
drops
with
the
sponge
and
then
squeezed
it
in
the
pitcher
after
she
had
worked
so
hard
to
fill
this
pitcher
the
little
son
of
the
king
who
was
playing
ball
from
caprice
threw
a
ball
and
broke
the
pitcher
when
the
old
woman
saw
this
she
said
listen
i
can
do
nothing
to
you
for
you
are
the
king
son
but
i
can
bestow
upon
you
an
imprecation
may
you
be
unable
to
marry
until
you
find
the
cunning
child
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
down
the
old
woman
words
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
and
said
nothing
about
it
when
he
was
eighteen
the
king
and
queen
wished
him
to
marry
then
he
remembered
the
old
woman
imprecation
took
the
piece
of
paper
and
said
ah
if
i
do
not
find
i
can
not
marry
when
it
seemed
fit
he
took
leave
of
his
father
and
mother
and
began
his
journey
entirely
alone
months
passed
without
meeting
any
one
one
evening
night
overtook
him
tired
and
discouraged
in
a
plain
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
large
house
at
daybreak
he
saw
an
ogress
coming
frightfully
tall
and
stout
who
cried
lower
your
tresses
for
me
to
climb
up
when
the
prince
heard
this
he
took
heart
and
said
there
she
is
lowered
her
tresses
which
seemed
never
to
end
and
the
ogress
climbed
up
by
them
the
next
day
the
ogress
descended
and
when
the
prince
saw
her
depart
he
came
from
under
the
tree
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
cried
lower
your
tresses
for
me
to
climb
up
she
believing
it
was
her
mother
for
she
called
the
ogress
mother
lowered
her
tresses
and
the
prince
climbed
boldly
up
when
he
was
up
he
said
ah
my
dear
little
sister
how
i
have
labored
to
find
you
and
he
told
her
of
the
old
imprecation
when
he
was
seven
years
old
she
gave
him
some
refreshments
and
then
said
you
see
if
the
ogress
returns
and
finds
you
here
she
will
devour
you
hide
yourself
the
ogress
returned
and
the
prince
concealed
himself
after
the
ogress
had
eaten
her
daughter
gave
her
wine
to
drink
and
made
her
drunk
then
she
said
my
mother
what
must
i
do
to
get
away
from
here
not
that
i
want
to
go
for
i
wish
to
stay
with
you
but
i
want
to
know
just
out
of
curiosity
tell
me
what
you
must
do
to
get
away
from
here
said
the
ogress
you
must
enchant
everything
that
there
is
here
so
that
i
shall
lose
time
i
shall
call
and
instead
of
you
the
chair
the
cupboard
the
chest
of
drawers
will
answer
for
you
when
you
do
not
appear
i
will
ascend
you
must
take
the
seven
balls
of
yarn
that
i
have
laid
away
when
i
come
and
do
not
find
you
i
shall
pursue
you
when
you
see
yourself
pursued
throw
down
the
first
ball
and
then
the
others
i
shall
always
overtake
you
until
you
throw
down
the
last
ball
her
daughter
heard
all
that
she
said
and
remembered
it
the
next
day
the
ogress
went
out
and
and
the
prince
did
what
they
had
to
do
they
went
about
the
whole
house
saying
table
you
answer
if
my
mother
comes
chairs
answer
if
my
mother
comes
chest
of
drawers
answer
if
my
mother
comes
and
so
she
enchanted
the
whole
house
then
she
and
the
prince
departed
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
seemed
to
fly
when
the
ogress
returned
she
called
let
down
your
tresses
that
i
may
climb
up
the
table
answered
come
come
mother
she
waited
a
while
and
when
no
one
appeared
to
draw
her
up
she
called
again
lower
your
tresses
for
me
to
climb
up
the
chair
answered
come
come
mother
she
waited
a
while
but
no
one
appeared
then
she
called
again
and
the
chest
of
drawers
replied
come
come
mother
meanwhile
the
lovers
were
fleeing
when
there
was
nothing
left
to
answer
the
ogress
cried
out
treason
treason
then
she
got
a
ladder
and
climbed
up
when
she
saw
that
her
daughter
and
the
balls
of
yarn
were
gone
she
cried
ah
wretch
i
will
drink
your
blood
then
she
hastened
after
the
fugitives
following
their
scent
they
saw
her
afar
off
and
when
she
saw
them
she
cried
turn
around
so
that
i
can
see
you
if
she
had
turned
around
she
would
have
been
enchanted
when
the
ogress
had
nearly
overtaken
them
threw
down
the
first
ball
and
suddenly
there
arose
a
lofty
mountain
the
ogress
was
not
disturbed
she
climbed
and
climbed
until
she
almost
overtook
the
two
again
then
seeing
her
near
at
hand
threw
down
the
second
ball
and
there
suddenly
appeared
a
plain
covered
with
razors
and
knives
the
ogress
all
cut
and
torn
followed
after
the
lovers
dripping
with
blood
when
saw
her
near
again
she
threw
down
the
third
ball
and
there
arose
a
terrible
river
the
ogress
threw
herself
into
the
river
and
continued
her
pursuit
although
she
was
half
dead
then
another
ball
and
there
appeared
a
fountain
of
vipers
and
many
other
things
at
last
dying
and
worn
out
the
ogress
stopped
and
cursed
saying
the
first
kiss
that
the
queen
gives
her
son
may
the
prince
forget
you
then
the
ogress
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
died
in
great
anguish
the
lovers
continued
their
journey
and
came
to
a
town
near
where
the
prince
lived
he
said
to
you
remain
here
for
you
are
not
provided
with
proper
clothes
and
i
will
go
and
get
what
you
need
and
then
you
can
appear
before
my
father
and
mother
she
consented
and
remained
when
the
queen
beheld
her
son
she
threw
herself
on
him
to
kiss
him
mother
said
he
i
have
made
a
vow
not
to
allow
myself
to
be
kissed
the
poor
mother
was
petrified
at
night
while
he
was
asleep
his
mother
who
was
dying
to
kiss
him
went
and
did
so
from
that
moment
he
forgot
all
about
let
us
leave
the
prince
with
his
mother
and
return
to
the
poor
girl
who
was
left
in
the
street
without
knowing
where
she
was
an
old
woman
met
her
and
saw
the
poor
girl
as
beautiful
as
the
sun
weeping
what
is
the
matter
my
daughter
i
do
not
know
how
i
came
here
my
daughter
do
not
despair
come
with
me
and
she
took
her
to
her
house
the
young
girl
was
deft
with
her
hands
and
could
work
enchantment
she
made
things
and
the
old
woman
sold
them
and
so
they
both
lived
one
day
the
maiden
said
to
the
old
woman
that
she
wanted
two
bits
of
old
cloth
from
the
palace
for
some
work
she
had
to
do
the
old
woman
went
to
the
palace
and
began
to
ask
for
the
bits
and
said
so
much
that
at
last
she
obtained
them
now
the
old
woman
had
two
doves
a
male
and
a
female
and
with
these
bits
of
cloth
dressed
the
doves
so
prettily
that
all
who
saw
them
marvelled
the
young
girl
took
these
doves
and
whispered
in
their
ears
you
are
the
prince
and
you
are
the
king
is
at
the
table
eating
fly
and
relate
all
that
you
have
undergone
while
the
king
queen
prince
and
many
others
were
at
the
table
the
beautiful
doves
flew
in
and
alighted
on
the
table
how
beautiful
you
are
and
all
were
greatly
pleased
then
the
dove
which
represented
began
do
you
remember
when
you
were
young
how
your
father
promised
a
fountain
of
oil
and
one
of
wine
for
your
birth
the
other
dove
answered
yes
i
remember
do
you
remember
the
old
woman
whose
pitcher
of
oil
you
broke
do
you
remember
yes
i
remember
do
you
remember
the
imprecation
she
pronounced
on
you
that
you
could
not
marry
until
you
found
i
remember
replied
the
other
dove
in
short
the
first
dove
recalled
all
that
had
passed
and
finally
said
do
you
remember
how
you
had
the
ogress
at
your
heels
and
how
she
cursed
you
saying
that
at
your
mother
first
kiss
you
must
forget
when
the
dove
came
to
the
kiss
the
prince
remembered
everything
and
the
king
and
queen
were
astounded
at
hearing
the
doves
speak
when
they
had
ended
their
discourse
the
doves
made
a
low
bow
and
flew
away
the
prince
cried
ho
there
ho
there
see
where
those
doves
go
see
where
they
go
the
servants
looked
and
saw
the
doves
alight
on
a
country
house
the
prince
hastened
and
entered
it
and
found
when
he
saw
her
he
threw
his
arms
about
her
neck
exclaiming
ah
my
sister
how
much
you
have
suffered
for
me
straightway
they
dressed
her
beautifully
and
conducted
her
to
the
palace
when
the
queen
saw
her
there
she
said
what
a
beauty
things
were
soon
settled
and
the
lovers
were
married
as
we
have
remarked
above
this
story
is
often
found
incomplete
the
ending
forgetfulness
of
bride
being
wanting
several
of
these
versions
are
from
milan
pp
in
the
first
the
king
of
the
sun
a
trait
occurs
that
is
of
some
interest
the
hero
plays
billiards
with
the
king
of
the
sun
and
wins
his
daughter
he
goes
in
search
of
his
bride
and
at
last
finds
an
old
man
who
tells
him
where
the
king
of
the
sun
lives
and
adds
in
a
wood
near
by
is
a
pond
where
in
the
afternoon
the
king
three
daughters
bathe
go
and
carry
away
their
clothes
and
when
they
come
and
ask
for
them
give
them
back
on
condition
that
they
will
take
you
to
their
father
the
hero
does
as
he
is
told
is
taken
to
the
king
and
obliged
to
choose
his
bride
from
among
the
three
with
his
eyes
blindfolded
the
remainder
of
the
story
consists
of
the
usual
flight
with
the
transformations
of
the
lovers
the
incident
of
the
maidens
who
bathe
and
whose
clothes
the
hero
steals
is
clearly
an
example
of
the
myth
and
occurs
in
a
few
other
italian
tales
in
a
story
from
the
north
of
italy
monferrato
comparetti
no
the
isle
of
happiness
a
poor
boy
goes
to
seek
his
fortune
he
encounters
an
old
man
who
tells
him
that
fortune
appears
but
once
in
a
hundred
years
and
if
not
taken
then
never
is
he
adds
that
this
is
the
very
time
for
fortune
to
appear
that
day
or
the
next
and
advises
the
youth
to
hide
himself
in
a
wood
near
the
bank
of
a
stream
and
when
three
beautiful
girls
come
and
bathe
to
carry
away
the
clothes
of
the
middle
one
he
does
so
and
compels
the
owner
who
is
none
other
than
fortune
to
marry
him
by
his
mother
fault
he
loses
his
bride
as
in
the
cupid
and
psyche
stories
and
is
obliged
to
go
in
search
of
her
to
the
isle
of
happiness
the
same
incident
occurs
in
several
sicilian
stories
in
one
pitrè
no
give
me
the
veil
the
hero
a
poor
youth
goes
in
search
of
his
fortune
as
in
the
last
story
and
meets
an
old
woman
who
tells
him
to
go
to
a
certain
fountain
where
twelve
doves
will
come
to
drink
and
become
twelve
maidens
as
beautiful
as
the
sun
with
veils
over
their
faces
and
advises
the
youth
to
seize
the
veil
of
the
most
beautiful
girl
and
keep
it
for
if
she
obtains
it
she
will
become
a
dove
again
the
youth
does
as
he
is
commanded
and
takes
his
wife
home
giving
the
veil
to
his
mother
to
keep
for
him
she
gives
it
to
the
wife
who
becomes
a
dove
again
and
disappears
the
same
thing
happens
twice
the
third
time
the
veil
is
burned
and
the
wife
who
turns
out
to
be
the
enchanted
daughter
of
the
king
of
spain
remains
with
her
husband
there
yet
remains
a
large
and
interesting
class
of
stories
to
be
examined
the
class
may
conveniently
be
termed
bluebeard
although
as
we
shall
see
there
are
three
versions
of
this
story
to
only
one
of
which
the
above
name
properly
belongs
these
three
versions
are
well
represented
by
the
three
grimm
stories
of
the
feather
bird
no
the
robber
bridegroom
no
and
the
child
no
in
the
first
version
which
is
properly
speaking
the
bluebeard
story
two
sisters
are
married
in
turn
and
killed
by
their
husband
because
they
open
the
forbidden
chamber
the
youngest
sister
although
she
opens
the
forbidden
door
manages
to
escape
and
deliver
her
sisters
whom
she
restores
to
life
in
the
second
version
a
robber
marries
several
sisters
whom
he
kills
for
disobeying
his
commands
the
trait
of
forbidden
chamber
is
usually
wanting
the
youngest
sister
again
manages
to
escape
and
restores
her
dead
sisters
to
life
generally
in
this
version
the
husband
makes
a
desperate
effort
to
be
revenged
on
the
sister
who
has
escaped
from
him
but
fails
in
this
also
in
the
third
version
a
young
girl
is
under
the
guardianship
of
some
supernatural
being
who
forbids
her
to
open
a
certain
door
the
child
disobeys
denies
her
fault
and
is
sent
away
in
disgrace
she
afterward
marries
and
her
children
are
taken
from
her
one
by
one
until
she
confesses
her
fault
or
as
is
the
case
in
an
italian
version
persists
in
her
denial
to
the
very
end
we
shall
examine
these
three
versions
separately
and
first
give
an
example
of
the
first
or
bluebeard
class
it
is
from
venice
no
vii
and
is
entitled
xvi
how
the
devil
married
three
sisters
once
upon
a
time
the
devil
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
marry
he
therefore
left
hell
took
the
form
of
a
handsome
young
man
and
built
a
fine
large
house
when
it
was
completed
and
furnished
in
the
most
fashionable
style
he
introduced
himself
to
a
family
where
there
were
three
pretty
daughters
and
paid
his
addresses
to
the
eldest
of
them
the
handsome
man
pleased
the
maiden
her
parents
were
glad
to
see
a
daughter
so
well
provided
for
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
wedding
was
celebrated
when
he
had
taken
his
bride
home
he
presented
her
with
a
very
tastefully
arranged
bouquet
led
her
through
all
the
rooms
of
the
house
and
finally
to
a
closed
door
the
whole
house
is
at
your
disposal
said
he
only
i
must
request
one
thing
of
you
that
is
that
you
do
not
on
any
account
open
this
door
of
course
the
young
wife
promised
faithfully
but
equally
of
course
she
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
moment
to
come
when
she
might
break
her
promise
when
the
devil
had
left
the
house
the
next
morning
under
pretence
of
going
hunting
she
ran
hastily
to
the
forbidden
door
opened
it
and
saw
a
terrible
abyss
full
of
fire
that
shot
up
towards
her
and
singed
the
flowers
on
her
bosom
when
her
husband
came
home
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
kept
her
promise
she
unhesitatingly
said
yes
but
he
saw
by
the
flowers
that
she
was
telling
a
lie
and
said
now
i
will
not
put
your
curiosity
to
the
test
any
longer
come
with
me
i
will
show
you
myself
what
is
behind
the
door
thereupon
he
led
her
to
the
door
opened
it
gave
her
such
a
push
that
she
fell
down
into
hell
and
shut
the
door
again
a
few
months
after
he
wooed
the
next
sister
for
his
wife
and
won
her
but
with
her
everything
that
had
happened
with
the
first
wife
was
exactly
repeated
finally
he
courted
the
third
sister
she
was
a
prudent
maiden
and
said
to
herself
he
has
certainly
murdered
my
two
sisters
but
then
it
is
a
splendid
match
for
me
so
i
will
try
and
see
whether
i
can
not
be
more
fortunate
than
they
and
accordingly
she
consented
after
the
wedding
the
bridegroom
gave
her
a
beautiful
bouquet
but
forbade
her
also
to
open
the
door
which
he
pointed
out
not
a
whit
less
curious
than
her
sisters
she
too
opened
the
forbidden
door
when
the
devil
had
gone
hunting
but
she
had
previously
put
her
flowers
in
water
then
she
saw
behind
the
door
the
fatal
abyss
and
her
sisters
therein
ah
she
exclaimed
poor
creature
that
i
am
i
thought
i
had
married
an
ordinary
man
and
instead
of
that
he
is
the
devil
how
can
i
get
away
from
him
she
carefully
pulled
her
two
sisters
out
of
hell
and
hid
them
when
the
devil
came
home
he
immediately
looked
at
the
bouquet
which
she
again
wore
on
her
bosom
and
when
he
found
the
flowers
so
fresh
he
asked
no
questions
but
reassured
as
to
his
secret
he
now
for
the
first
time
really
loved
her
after
a
few
days
she
asked
him
if
he
would
carry
three
chests
for
her
to
her
parents
house
without
putting
them
down
or
resting
on
the
way
but
she
added
you
must
keep
your
word
for
i
shall
be
watching
you
the
devil
promised
to
do
exactly
as
she
wished
so
the
next
morning
she
put
one
of
her
sisters
in
a
chest
and
laid
it
on
her
husband
shoulders
the
devil
who
is
very
strong
but
also
very
lazy
and
unaccustomed
to
work
soon
got
tired
of
carrying
the
heavy
chest
and
wanted
to
rest
before
he
was
out
of
the
street
on
which
he
lived
but
his
wife
called
out
to
him
do
put
it
down
i
see
you
the
devil
went
reluctantly
on
with
the
chest
until
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
then
said
to
himself
she
can
not
see
me
here
i
will
rest
a
little
but
scarcely
had
he
begun
to
put
the
chest
down
when
the
sister
inside
cried
out
do
put
it
down
i
see
you
still
cursing
he
dragged
the
chest
on
into
another
street
and
was
going
to
lay
it
down
on
a
doorstep
but
he
again
heard
the
voice
do
lay
it
down
you
rascal
i
see
you
still
what
kind
of
eyes
must
my
wife
have
he
thought
to
see
around
corners
as
well
as
straight
ahead
and
through
walls
as
if
they
were
made
of
glass
and
thus
thinking
he
arrived
all
in
a
perspiration
and
quite
tired
out
at
the
house
of
his
to
whom
he
hastily
delivered
the
chest
and
then
hurried
home
to
strengthen
himself
with
a
good
breakfast
the
same
thing
was
repeated
the
next
day
with
the
second
chest
on
the
third
day
she
herself
was
to
be
taken
home
in
the
chest
she
therefore
prepared
a
figure
which
she
dressed
in
her
own
clothes
and
placed
on
the
balcony
under
the
pretext
of
being
able
to
watch
him
better
slipped
quickly
into
the
chest
and
had
the
maid
put
it
on
the
back
the
deuce
said
he
this
chest
is
a
great
deal
heavier
than
the
others
and
when
she
is
sitting
on
the
balcony
i
shall
have
so
much
the
less
chance
to
rest
so
by
dint
of
the
greatest
exertions
he
carried
it
without
stopping
to
his
and
then
hastened
home
to
breakfast
scolding
and
with
his
back
almost
broken
but
quite
contrary
to
custom
his
wife
did
not
come
out
to
meet
him
and
there
was
no
breakfast
ready
margerita
where
are
you
he
cried
but
received
no
answer
as
he
was
running
through
the
corridors
he
at
length
looked
out
of
a
window
and
saw
the
figure
on
the
balcony
margerita
have
you
gone
to
sleep
come
down
i
am
as
tired
as
a
dog
and
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
but
there
was
no
reply
if
you
do
not
come
down
instantly
i
will
go
up
and
bring
you
down
he
cried
angrily
but
margerita
did
not
stir
enraged
he
hastened
up
to
the
balcony
and
gave
her
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
her
head
flew
off
and
he
saw
that
the
head
was
nothing
but
a
milliner
form
and
the
body
a
bundle
of
rags
raging
he
rushed
down
and
rummaged
through
the
whole
house
but
in
vain
he
found
only
his
wife
empty
ha
he
cried
she
has
been
stolen
from
me
and
her
jewels
too
and
he
immediately
ran
to
inform
her
parents
of
the
misfortune
but
when
he
came
near
the
house
to
his
great
surprise
he
saw
on
the
balcony
above
the
door
all
three
sisters
his
wives
who
were
looking
down
on
him
with
scornful
laughter
three
wives
at
once
terrified
the
devil
so
much
that
he
took
his
flight
with
all
possible
speed
since
that
time
he
has
lost
his
taste
for
marrying
we
have
already
mentioned
in
the
class
of
bride
won
by
solving
riddle
the
story
in
gonzenbach
of
the
robber
who
had
a
witch
head
in
this
story
after
the
robber
has
married
the
first
princess

in
a
basket
what
his
wife
says
of
him
in
his
absence
the
counterpart
of
the
witch
head
is
found
in
several
very
curious
italian
stories
in
these
a
magician
is
substituted
for

again
so
that

would
not
notice

then
she
extracted
from
her
husband
the
secret
of
his
life
i
can
not
be
killed
but
if
any
one
sticks
a

in
my
ears

as
soon
as
possible
into

restores
the

flies
with
him
and
marries
him
some
years
after
the
branch
in
the
magician
ears
withered
and
fell
out
and
he
awakened
then
he
desired
to
be
revenged
and
travelled
about
until
he
found
where
his
wife
lived
then
he
had
a
silver
statue
made
in
which
he
could
conceal
himself
and
in
which
he
placed
some
musical
instruments
he
shut
himself
up
in
it
and
had
himself
and
the
statue
taken
to
the
palace
where
maruzza
and
her
husband
lived
in
the
night
when
all
were
asleep
the
magician
came
out
of
the
statue
carried
maruzza
to
the
kitchen
kindled
a
fire
and
put
on
some
oil
to
boil
into
which
he
intended
to
throw
poor
maruzza
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
do
it
the
flask
which
he
had
laid
on
the
king
bed
and
which
had
thrown
him
into
a
magic
sleep
rolled
off
and
the
king
awoke
heard
maruzza
cries
saved
her
and
threw
the
magician
into
the
boiling
oil
in
spite
of
his
assurances
he
seems
to
have
been
very
thoroughly
killed
a
florentine
story
called
the
baker
three
daughters
is
a
combination
of
the
bluebeard
and
robber
bridegroom
stories
the
husband
forbids
his
wife
to
open
a
certain
door
with
a
gold
key
saying
you
can
not
deceive
me
the
little
dog
will
tell
me
and
besides
i
will
leave
you
a
bouquet
of
flowers
which
you
must
give
me
on
my
return
and
which
will
wither
if
you
enter
that
room
the
two
sisters
yield
to
their
curiosity
and
are
killed
the
third
sister
kills
the
treacherous
little
dog
delivers
the
prince
as
in
the
last
story
flies
with
him
and
the
story
ends
much
as
the
last
does
in
a
milanese
version
of
this
story
with
the
same
title
the
robber
bridegroom
takes
his
wife
home
and
informs
her
that
it
is
her
duty
to
watch
at
night
and
open
the
door
to
the
robbers
when
they
return
the
poor
wife
falls
asleep
and
is
murdered
so
with
the
second
sister
the
third
remains
awake
rescues
the
prince
and
flies
with
him
the
rest
of
the
story
is
as
above
of
the
third
version
of
the
bluebeard
story
there
are
but
two
italian
examples
one
from
sicily
gonz
no
and
one
from
pisa
comparetti
no
the
former
is
entitled
the
godchild
of
francis
of
paula
and
is
briefly
as
follows
a
queen
through
the
intercession
of
francis
of
paula
has
a
girl
whom
she
names
pauline
from
the
saint
the
saint
is
in
the
habit
of
meeting
the
child
on
her
way
to
school
and
giving
her
candy
one
day
the
saint
tells
her
to
ask
her
mother
whether
it
is
best
to
suffer
in
youth
or
old
age
the
mother
replies
that
it
is
better
to
suffer
in
youth
thereupon
the
saint
carries
away
pauline
and
shuts
her
up
in
a
tower
climbing
up
and
down
by
her
tresses
as
in
other
stories
we
have
already
mentioned
in
the
tower
the
saint
instructed
pauline
in
all
that
belonged
to
her
rank
one
day
a
king
climbs
up
by
the
hair
and
persuades
pauline
to
fly
with
him
she
consents
and
becomes
his
bride
when
her
first
child
was
born
francis
came
and
took
it
away
rubbed
the
mother
mouth
with
blood
and
deprived
her
of
speech
three
times
this
happened
and
then
the
queen
was
repudiated
and
confined
in
a
remote
room
where
she
spent
her
time
in
praying
to
francis
meanwhile
the
arranged
another
marriage
for
her
son
but
during
the
banquet
the
saint
brought
pauline
royal
robes
and
restored
her
three
children
to
her
then
he
led
all
four
to
the
and
the
happy
family
lived
thereafter
in
peace
and
happpiness
the
forbidden
chamber
is
omitted
in
the
above
version
but
is
found
in
the
pisan
story
the
woodman
the
main
idea
of
the
story
however
is
curiously
distorted
a
woodman
had
three
daughters
whom
he
can
not
support
one
day
a
lady
met
him
in
the
wood
and
offered
to
take
one
of
his
daughters
for
a
companion
giving
him
a
purse
of
money
and
assuring
him
that
he
would
always
find
enough
wood
the
lady
took
her
home
and
told
her
she
must
not
open
a
certain
door
during
her
absence
the
girl
did
so
however
and
saw
her
mistress
in
a
bath
with
two
damsels
reading
a
book
she
closed
the
door
at
once
but
when
the
mistress
returned
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
disobeyed
and
what
she
had
seen
she
confessed
her
fault
and
told
what
she
saw
then
the
lady
cut
her
head
off
hung
it
by
the
hair
to
a
beam
and
buried
the
body
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
second
sister
who
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
lady
sitting
at
a
table
with
gentlemen
the
lady
killed
her
too
and
then
took
the
third
sister
who
in
spite
of
having
seen
her
two
sisters
heads
could
not
control
her
curiosity
and
opened
the
door
she
saw
her
mistress
reclining
in
a
beautiful
bed
in
the
evening
the
lady
returned
and
asked
her
what
she
had
seen
but
she
answered
i
have
seen
nothing
the
lady
could
extort
no
other
answer
from
her
and
finally
clothed
her
in
her
peasant
dress
and
took
her
back
to
the
wood
and
left
her
the
king
of
the
neighboring
city
happened
to
pass
by
and
fell
in
love
with
her
and
married
her
when
her
first
child
was
born
the
lady
appeared
at
her
bedside
and
said
now
it
is
time
to
tell
me
what
you
saw
i
saw
nothing
replied
the
young
queen
then
the
lady
carried
away
the
child
having
first
rubbed
the
mother
mouth
with
blood
this
happened
a
second
time
and
then
the
king
put
her
away
and
prepared
to
marry
again
the
first
wife
was
invited
to
the
wedding
feast
while
at
the
table
the
lady
appeared
under
it
and
pulled
the
first
wife
dress
and
said
will
you
tell
what
you
saw
the
reply
was
twice
nothing
then
the
queen
fainted
at
that
moment
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
palace
with
a
great
lady
in
it
who
asked
to
see
the
king
she
told
him
that
it
was
she
who
had
carried
away
his
children
and
added
that
from
her
childhood
she
had
been
subjected
to
an
enchantment
that
was
to
end
when
she
found
a
person
who
should
say
that
she
had
seen
nothing
in
that
room
she
then
brought
back
the
children
and
all
lived
together
in
peace
and
joy
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
touching
of
all
fairy
tales
is
the
one
known
to
the
readers
of
grimm
collection
by
the
title
of
faithful
john
and
which
has
such
a
charming
parallel
in
the
story
of
rama
and
luxman
in
miss
frere
old
deccan
days
there
are
seven
italian
versions
of
this
interesting
story
which
we
shall
mention
briefly
giving
first
the
shortest
entire
as
a
point
of
departure
it
is
from
the
north
of
italy
comparetti
monferrato
no
and
is
called
xvii
in
love
with
a
statue
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
two
sons
the
eldest
did
not
wish
to
marry
and
the
youngest
although
he
went
about
everywhere
found
no
lady
to
his
taste
now
it
happened
that
he
once
went
to
a
certain
city
and
there
saw
a
statue
with
which
he
fell
in
love
he
bought
it
had
it
carried
to
his
room
and
every
day
embraced
and
kissed
it
one
day
his
father
became
aware
of
this
and
said
to
him
what
are
you
doing
if
you
want
a
wife
take
one
of
flesh
and
bones
and
not
one
of
marble
he
answered
that
he
would
take
one
exactly
like
the
statue
or
none
at
all
his
older
brother
who
at
this
time
had
nothing
to
do
went
out
into
the
world
to
seek
her
on
his
way
he
saw
in
a
city
a
man
who
had
a
mouse
which
danced
so
that
it
seemed
like
a
human
being
he
said
to
himself
i
will
take
it
home
to
my
brother
to
amuse
himself
with
he
continued
his
journey
and
arrived
in
a
more
distant
town
where
he
found
a
bird
that
sang
like
an
angel
and
bought
that
too
for
his
brother
he
was
on
the
point
of
returning
home
and
was
passing
through
a
street
when
he
saw
a
beggar
knocking
at
a
door
a
very
beautiful
girl
appeared
at
the
window
who
resembled
in
every
respect
the
prince
statue
and
suddenly
withdrew
then
he
told
the
beggar
to
ask
alms
again
but
the
beggar
refused
because
he
feared
that
the
magician
who
was
then
absent
would
return
home
and
eat
him
up
but
the
prince
gave
him
so
much
money
and
other
things
that
he
knocked
again
and
the
young
girl
appeared
again
and
suddenly
withdrew
then
the
prince
went
through
the
streets
saying
that
he
mended
and
sold
the
servant
of
the
young
girl
who
heard
him
told
her
mistress
to
go
and
see
the
mirrors
she
went
but
he
told
her
that
if
she
wanted
to
select
the
mirrors
she
would
have
to
go
on
board
his
ship
when
she
was
there
he
carried
her
away
and
she
wept
bitterly
and
sighed
so
that
he
would
let
her
return
home
but
it
was
like
speaking
to
the
wall
when
they
were
out
at
sea
there
was
heard
the
voice
of
a
large
black
bird
saying
ciriù
what
a
handsome
mouse
you
have
you
will
take
it
to
your
brother
you
will
turn
his
head
and
if
you
tell
him
of
it
you
will
become
marble
ciriù
a
fine
bird
you
have
you
will
take
it
to
your
brother
you
will
turn
his
head
and
if
you
tell
him
you
will
become
marble
ciriù
a
fine
lady
you
have
you
will
take
her
to
your
brother
you
will
turn
his
head
and
if
you
tell
him
of
it
you
will
become
marble
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
tell
his
brother
because
he
was
afraid
of
becoming
marble
he
landed
and
took
the
mouse
to
his
brother
and
when
he
had
seen
it
and
wanted
it
the
elder
brother
cut
off
its
head
then
he
showed
him
the
bird
that
sang
like
an
angel
and
his
brother
wanted
it
but
the
elder
brother
again
cut
off
its
head
then
he
said
i
have
something
handsomer
and
he
produced
the
beautiful
girl
who
looked
like
the
statue
and
as
the
brother
who
had
brought
her
said
nothing
the
other
feared
that
he
would
take
her
away
from
him
and
had
him
thrown
into
prison
where
he
was
a
long
time
and
because
he
continued
to
keep
silence
he
was
condemned
to
death
three
days
before
he
was
to
die
he
asked
his
brother
to
come
and
see
him
and
he
consented
although
unwillingly
then
the
condemned
brother
said
a
large
black
bird
told
me
that
if
i
brought
you
back
the
dancing
mouse
and
spoke
i
should
become
a
statue
and
saying
this
he
became
a
statue
to
the
waist
and
if
bringing
you
the
singing
bird
i
spoke
it
would
be
the
same
then
he
became
a
statue
to
his
breast
and
if
bringing
you
the
lady
i
spoke
i
should
become
a
statue
then
he
became
a
statue
all
over
and
his
brother
began
to
lament
in
despair
and
tried
to
restore
him
to
life
all
kinds
of
physicians
came
but
none
succeeded
finally
there
came
one
who
said
that
he
was
capable
of
turning
the
statue
into
a
man
provided
they
gave
him
what
he
needed
the
king
said
he
would
do
so
and
the
physician
demanded
the
blood
of
the
king
two
children
but
the
mother
would
on
no
account
consent
then
the
king
gave
a
ball
and
while
his
wife
was
dancing
he
had
the
two
children
killed
and
bathed
with
their
blood
the
statue
of
his
brother
and
the
statue
straightway
became
a
man
and
went
to
the
ball
the
mother
when
she
beheld
him
suddenly
thought
of
her
children
she
ran
to
them
and
found
them
half
dead
and
fainted
away
all
around
sought
to
console
and
encourage
her
but
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
the
physician
she
cried
out
of
my
sight
ugly
wretch
it
is
you
who
have
caused
my
children
to
be
killed
he
answered
pardon
me
my
lady
i
have
done
no
harm
go
and
see
whether
your
children
are
there
she
ran
to
see
and
found
them
alive
and
making
a
great
noise
then
the
physician
said
i
am
the
magician
your
father
whom
you
forsook
and
i
have
wished
to
show
you
what
it
is
to
love
one
children
then
they
made
peace
and
remained
happy
and
contented
in
the
venetian
version
teza
trad
dei
sette
called
mela
and
buccia
from
the
names
of
the
prince
and
his
friend
while
the
two
friends
are
spending
the
night
in
a
deserted
castle
buccia
hears
a
voice
foretelling
the
dangers
to
which
mela
will
be
exposed
his
horse
will
throw
him
if
buccia
does
not
kill
it
a
dragon
will
devour
him
on
his
wedding
night
if
buccia
does
not
kill
it
and
finally
the
queen
pet
dog
will
mortally
wound
him
if
buccia
does
not
kill
it
if
however
buccia
reveals
what
he
has
heard
he
will
turn
to
stone
buccia
acts
accordingly
and
the
king
forgives
him
everything
but
killing
the
queen
pet
dog
for
that
buccia
is
condemned
to
be
hung
then
he
relates
all
and
gradually
turns
to
stone
from
his
feet
up
the
king
queen
and
buccia
mother
are
inconsolable
until
they
are
informed
by
an
old
woman
that
the
blood
of
the
little
prince
will
bring
the
statue
back
to
life
the
faithful
friend
is
by
that
means
restored
and
the
child
also
saved
in
this
version
the
abduction
is
wanting
and
the
last
danger
is
not
the
one
usually
threatened
in
a
version
from
siena
gradi
one
of
two
brothers
goes
in
search
of
the
princess
with
blonde
tresses
he
also
buys
a
parrot
and
a
horse
and
the
dangers
are
he
who
touches
the
parrot
will
have
his
eyes
put
out
he
who
mounts
the
horse
will
be
thrown
he
who
marries
the
fair
one
will
be
devoured
by
a
dragon
and
he
who
reveals
these
dangers
will
become
stone
the
remainder
of
the
story
is
like
the
last
version
the
florentine
version
is
mixed
up
with
a
number
of
other
incidents
the
dangers
from
which
the
prince
is
saved
by
his
faithful
servant
are
poisoned
apples
poisoned
pastry
and
a
lion
in
the
royal
chamber
the
servant
is
turned
to
stone
and
restored
as
in
the
other
versions
in
a
mantuan
story
no
the
dangers
are
parrot
horse
and
bride
whoever
touches
these
will
be
devoured
by
a
dragon
whoever
reveals
these
dangers
will
become
stone
the
conclusion
is
the
same
as
above
the
last
version
we
shall
mention
here
is
in
the
pentamerone
iv
and
resembles
the
one
from
monferrato
the
elder
brother
who
goes
in
search
of
a
bride
for
his
younger
brother
buys
a
falcon
and
a
horse
the
first
will
pick
out
the
younger
brother
eyes
the
horse
will
throw
him
and
finally
a
dragon
will
devour
him
on
his
wedding
night
the
remainder
of
the
story
is
as
usual
we
shall
conclude
this
chapter
with
the
class
of
stories
in
which
giants
are
outwitted
by
men
the
simplest
form
is
found
in
two
stories
which
are
interesting
examples
of
the
survival
of
classic
myths
both
stories
are
from
sicily
and
one
was
told
to
pitrè
by
a
girl
eight
years
old
pitrè
no
it
is
entitled
the
little
monk
and
is
in
substance
as
follows
there
were
once
two
monks
who
went
begging
for
the
church
every
year
one
was
large
and
the
other
small
they
lost
their
way
once
and
came
to
a
large
cave
in
which
was
a
monster
lit
animal
who
was
building
a
fire
the
two
monks
however
did
not
believe
it
was
a
monster
but
said
let
us
go
and
rest
there
they
entered
and
saw
the
monster
killing
a
sheep
and
roasting
it
he
had
already
killed
and
cooked
twenty
eat
said
the
monster
to
them
we
do
want
to
eat
we
are
not
hungry
eat
i
tell
you
after
they
had
eaten
the
sheep
they
lay
down
and
the
monster
closed
the
entrance
to
the
cave
with
a
great
stone
then
he
took
a
sharp
iron
heated
it
in
the
fire
and
stuck
it
in
the
throat
of
the
larger
of
the
two
monks
roasted
the
body
and
wanted
the
other
monk
to
help
eat
it
i
do
want
to
eat
said
he
i
am
full
get
up
said
the
monster
if
you
do
i
will
kill
you
the
wretched
monk
arose
in
fright
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
pretended
to
eat
but
threw
the
flesh
away
in
the
night
the
good
man
took
the
iron
heated
it
and
plunged
it
in
the
monster
eyes
then
the
monk
in
his
terror
slipped
into
the
skin
of
a
sheep
the
monster
felt
his
way
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
removed
the
stone
and
let
the
sheep
out
one
by
one
and
so
the
good
man
escaped
and
returned
to
trapani
and
told
his
story
to
some
fishermen
the
monster
went
fishing
and
being
blind
stumbled
against
a
rock
and
broke
his
head
the
other
version
is
from
the
albanian
colony
of
piana
de
greci
comparetti
no
in
sicily
and
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
story
just
given
generally
however
the
stories
in
which
giants
are
outwitted
by
men
are
more
complicated
and
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
one
where
the
giant
is
outwitted
by
superior
cunning
the
other
where
the
stupidity
is
deceived
by
the
man
braggadocio
the
first
class
may
be
represented
by
a
sicilian
story
pitrè
no
entitled
xviii
thirteenth
there
was
once
a
father
who
had
thirteen
sons
the
youngest
of
whom
was
named
thirteenth
the
father
had
hard
work
to
support
his
children
but
made
what
he
could
gathering
herbs
the
mother
to
make
the
children
quick
said
to
them
the
one
who
comes
home
first
shall
have
herb
soup
thirteenth
always
returned
the
first
and
the
soup
always
fell
to
his
share
on
which
account
his
brothers
hated
him
and
sought
to
get
rid
of
him
the
king
issued
a
proclamation
in
the
city
that
he
who
was
bold
enough
to
go
and
steal
the
ogre
coverlet
should
receive
a
measure
of
gold
thirteenth
brothers
went
to
the
king
and
said
majesty
we
have
a
brother
named
thirteenth
who
is
confident
that
he
can
do
that
and
other
things
too
the
king
said
bring
him
to
me
at
once
they
brought
thirteenth
who
said
majesty
how
is
it
possible
to
steal
the
ogre
coverlet
if
he
sees
me
he
will
eat
me
no
matter
you
must
go
said
the
king
i
know
that
you
are
bold
and
this
act
of
bravery
you
must
perform
thirteenth
departed
and
went
to
the
house
of
the
ogre
who
was
away
the
ogress
was
in
the
kitchen
thirteenth
entered
quietly
and
hid
himself
under
the
bed
at
night
the
ogre
returned
he
ate
his
supper
and
went
to
bed
saying
as
he
did
so
i
smell
the
smell
of
human
flesh
where
i
see
it
i
will
swallow
it
the
ogress
replied
be
still
no
one
has
entered
here
the
ogre
began
to
snore
and
thirteenth
pulled
the
coverlet
a
little
the
ogre
awoke
and
cried
what
is
that
thirteenth
began
to
mew
like
a
cat
the
ogress
said
scat
scat
and
clapped
her
hands
and
then
fell
asleep
again
with
the
ogre
then
thirteenth
gave
a
hard
pull
seized
the
coverlet
and
ran
away
the
ogre
heard
him
running
recognized
him
in
the
dark
and
said
i
know
you
you
are
thirteenth
without
doubt
after
a
time
the
king
issued
another
proclamation
that
whoever
would
steal
the
ogre
horse
and
bring
it
to
the
king
should
receive
a
measure
of
gold
thirteenth
again
presented
himself
and
asked
for
a
silk
ladder
and
a
bag
of
cakes
with
these
things
he
departed
and
went
at
night
to
the
ogre
climbed
up
without
being
heard
and
descended
to
the
stable
the
horse
neighed
on
seeing
him
but
he
offered
it
a
cake
saying
do
you
see
how
sweet
it
is
if
you
will
come
with
me
my
master
will
give
you
these
always
then
he
gave
it
another
saying
let
me
mount
you
and
see
how
we
go
so
he
mounted
it
kept
feeding
it
with
cakes
and
brought
it
to
the
king
stable
the
king
issued
another
proclamation
that
he
would
give
a
measure
of
gold
to
whoever
would
bring
him
the
ogre
bolster
thirteenth
said
majesty
how
is
that
possible
the
bolster
is
full
of
little
bells
and
you
must
know
that
the
ogre
awakens
at
a
breath
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
the
king
i
wish
it
at
any
cost
thirteenth
departed
and
went
and
crept
under
the
ogre
bed
at
midnight
he
stretched
out
his
hand
very
softly
but
the
little
bells
all
sounded
what
is
that
said
the
ogre
nothing
replied
the
ogress
perhaps
it
is
the
wind
that
makes
them
ring
but
the
ogre
who
was
suspicious
pretended
to
sleep
but
kept
his
ears
open
thirteenth
stretched
out
his
hand
again
alack
the
ogre
put
out
his
arm
and
seized
him
now
you
are
caught
just
wait
i
will
make
you
cry
for
your
first
trick
for
your
second
and
for
your
third
after
this
he
put
thirteenth
in
a
barrel
and
began
to
feed
him
on
raisins
and
figs
after
a
time
he
said
stick
out
your
finger
little
thirteenth
so
that
i
can
see
whether
you
are
fat
thirteenth
saw
there
a
mouse
tail
and
stuck
that
out
ah
how
thin
you
are
said
the
ogre
and
besides
you
do
smell
good
eat
my
son
take
the
raisins
and
figs
and
get
fat
soon
after
some
days
the
ogre
told
him
again
to
put
out
his
finger
and
thirteenth
stuck
out
a
spindle
eh
wretch
are
you
still
lean
eat
eat
and
get
fat
soon
at
the
end
of
a
month
thirteenth
had
nothing
more
to
stick
out
and
was
obliged
to
show
his
finger
the
ogre
cried
out
in
joy
he
is
fat
he
is
fat
the
ogress
hastened
to
the
spot
quick
my
ogress
heat
the
oven
three
nights
and
three
days
for
i
am
going
to
invite
our
relatives
and
we
will
make
a
fine
banquet
of
thirteenth
the
ogress
heated
the
oven
three
days
and
three
nights
and
then
released
thirteenth
from
the
barrel
and
said
to
him
come
here
thirteenth
we
have
got
to
put
the
lamb
in
the
oven
but
thirteenth
caught
her
meaning
and
when
he
approached
the
oven
he
said
ah
mother
ogress
what
is
that
black
thing
in
the
corner
of
the
oven
the
ogress
stooped
down
a
little
but
saw
nothing
stoop
down
again
said
thirteenth
so
that
you
can
see
it
when
she
stooped
down
again
thirteenth
seized
her
by
the
feet
and
threw
her
into
the
oven
and
then
closed
the
oven
door
when
she
was
cooked
he
took
her
out
carefully
cut
her
in
two
divided
her
legs
into
pieces
and
put
them
on
the
table
and
placed
her
trunk
with
her
head
and
arms
in
the
bed
under
the
sheet
and
tied
a
string
to
the
chin
and
another
to
the
back
of
her
head
when
the
ogre
arrived
with
his
guests
he
found
the
dishes
on
the
table
then
he
went
to
his
wife
bed
and
asked
mother
ogress
do
you
want
to
dine
thirteenth
pulled
the
string
and
the
ogress
shook
her
head
how
are
you
tired
and
thirteenth
who
was
hidden
under
the
bed
pulled
the
other
string
and
made
her
nod
now
it
happened
that
one
of
her
relatives
moved
something
and
saw
that
the
ogress
was
dead
and
only
half
of
her
was
there
she
cried
in
a
loud
voice
treason
treason
and
all
hastened
to
the
bed
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
thirteenth
escaped
from
under
the
bed
and
ran
away
to
the
king
with
the
bolster
and
the
ogre
most
valuable
things
after
this
the
king
said
to
thirteenth
listen
thirteenth
to
complete
your
valiant
exploits
i
wish
you
to
bring
me
the
ogre
himself
in
person
alive
and
well
how
can
i
your
majesty
said
thirteenth
then
he
roused
himself
and
added
i
see
how
now
then
he
had
a
very
strong
chest
made
and
disguised
himself
as
a
monk
with
a
long
false
beard
and
went
to
the
ogre
house
and
called
out
to
him
do
you
know
thirteenth
the
wretch
he
has
killed
our
superior
but
if
i
catch
him
if
i
catch
him
i
will
shut
him
up
in
this
chest
at
these
words
the
ogre
drew
near
and
said
i
too
would
like
to
help
you
against
that
wretch
of
an
assassin
for
you
do
know
what
he
has
done
to
me
and
he
began
to
tell
his
story
but
what
shall
we
do
said
the
pretended
monk
i
do
not
know
thirteenth
do
you
know
him
yes
sir
then
tell
me
father
ogre
how
tall
is
he
as
tall
as
i
am
if
that
is
so
said
thirteenth
let
us
see
whether
this
chest
will
hold
you
if
it
will
hold
you
it
will
hold
him
oh
good
said
the
ogre
and
got
into
the
chest
then
thirteenth
shut
the
chest
and
said
look
carefully
father
ogre
and
see
whether
there
is
any
hole
in
the
chest
there
is
none
just
wait
let
us
see
whether
it
shuts
well
and
is
heavy
to
carry
meanwhile
thirteenth
shut
and
nailed
up
the
chest
took
it
on
his
back
and
hastened
to
the
city
when
the
ogre
cried
enough
now
thirteenth
ran
all
the
faster
and
laughing
sang
this
song
to
taunt
the
ogre
i
am
thirteenth
who
carry
you
on
my
back
i
have
tricked
you
and
am
going
to
trick
you
i
must
deliver
you
to
the
king
when
he
reached
the
king
the
king
had
an
iron
chain
attached
to
the
ogre
hands
and
feet
and
made
him
gnaw
bones
the
rest
of
his
miserable
life
the
king
gave
thirteenth
all
the
riches
and
treasures
he
could
bestow
on
him
and
always
wished
him
at
his
side
as
a
man
of
the
highest
valor
the
second
version
of
the
above
story
in
which
the
giant
is
deceived
by
the
hero
braggadocio
is
represented
by
several
italian
stories
the
simplest
are
some
milanese
versions
pp
one
of
which
is
as
follows
xix
the
cobbler
there
was
once
a
cobbler
who
one
day
was
so
tired
of
cobbling
that
he
said
now
i
will
go
and
seek
my
fortune
he
bought
a
little
cheese
and
put
it
on
the
table
it
got
full
of
flies
and
he
took
an
old
shoe
and
hit
the
cheese
and
killed
all
the
flies
he
afterward
counted
them
and
five
hundred
were
killed
and
four
hundred
wounded
he
then
girded
on
a
sword
and
put
on
a
cocked
hat
and
went
to
the
court
and
said
to
the
king
i
am
the
chief
warrior
of
the
flies
four
hundred
i
have
killed
and
five
hundred
i
have
wounded
the
king
answered
since
you
are
a
warrior
you
will
be
brave
enough
to
climb
that
mountain
there
where
there
are
two
magicians
and
kill
them
if
you
kill
them
you
shall
marry
my
daughter
then
he
gave
him
a
white
flag
to
wave
when
he
had
killed
them
and
sound
the
trumpet
you
will
put
his
head
in
a
bag
both
the
heads
to
show
me
the
cobbler
then
departed
and
found
a
house
which
was
an
inn
and
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
were
none
other
than
the
magician
and
his
wife
he
asked
for
lodging
and
food
and
all
he
needed
afterward
he
went
to
his
room
but
before
going
to
bed
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
there
he
saw
a
great
stone
over
the
bed
instead
of
getting
into
bed
he
got
into
a
corner
when
a
certain
hour
struck
the
magicians
let
the
stone
drop
and
it
crushed
the
whole
bed
the
next
morning
the
cobbler
went
down
and
said
that
he
could
not
sleep
for
the
noise
they
told
him
they
would
change
his
room
the
same
thing
happened
the
next
night
and
in
the
morning
they
told
him
they
would
give
him
another
room
when
it
was
a
certain
hour
the
husband
and
wife
went
to
the
forest
to
cut
a
bundle
of
fagots
then
the
magician
went
home
and
the
cobbler
who
had
made
ready
a
sickle
said
wait
until
i
help
you
to
take
the
bundle
off
your
back
then
he
gave
the
magician
a
blow
with
the
sickle
and
cut
off
his
head
he
did
the
same
thing
when
the
magician
wife
returned
then
he
unfurled
his
flag
and
sounded
his
trumpet
and
the
band
went
out
to
meet
him
after
he
had
arrived
at
the
court
the
king
said
to
him
now
that
you
have
killed
the
two
magicians
you
shall
marry
my
daughter
but
the
cobbler
had
got
so
used
to
drawing
the
thread
that
he
did
so
in
his
sleep
and
kept
hitting
his
wife
so
that
she
could
not
rest
then
the
king
gave
him
a
great
deal
of
money
and
sent
him
home
a
more
detailed
version
is
found
in
a
sicilian
story
in
gonzenbach
the
brave
shoemaker
no
the
first
part
of
which
is
like
the
milanese
version
on
his
way
to
the
giant
the
cobbler
makes
some
balls
of
plaster
of
paris
and
and
puts
them
in
his
pocket
when
he
heard
the
giant
coming
through
the
woods
he
climbed
a
tree
but
the
giant
scented
him
and
told
him
to
come
down
the
cobbler
answered
that
if
he
did
not
leave
him
alone
he
would
twist
his
neck
and
to
show
him
how
strong
he
was
he
crushed
the
balls
of
plaster
of
paris
in
his
hands
telling
the
giant
they
were
marble
the
giant
was
frightened
and
invited
the
cobbler
to
remain
with
him
and
took
him
home
after
a
while
the
giant
asked
him
to
bring
some
water
in
a
pitcher
from
the
well
the
cobbler
said
that
if
the
giant
would
give
him
a
strong
rope
he
would
bring
the
well
itself
the
giant
in
terror
took
the
pitcher
and
drew
the
water
himself
then
the
giant
asked
the
cobbler
to
cut
some
wood
but
the
latter
asked
for
a
strong
rope
to
drag
a
whole
tree
to
the
house
with
then
the
giant
proposed
a
trial
of
strength
to
see
which
could
carry
a
heavy
stick
the
longer
the
cobbler
said
that
the
giant
had
better
wind
something
about
the
thick
end
for
when
he
the
cobbler
turned
a
somersault
with
it
he
might
hit
the
giant
when
they
went
to
bed
the
giant
made
the
cobbler
sleep
with
him
but
the
latter
crept
under
the
bed
leaving
a
pumpkin
in
his
place
the
giant
who
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
cobbler
took
an
iron
bar
and
struck
at
the
pumpkin
all
night
believing
it
the
cobbler
head
after
he
had
beaten
the
pumpkin
to
pieces
the
cobbler
under
the
bed
gave
a
sigh
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
the
terrified
giant
a
flea
has
just
bitten
my
ear
answered
the
cobbler
the
next
day
the
cobbler
proposed
to
the
giant
to
cook
a
great
kettle
of
macaroni
and
after
they
had
eaten
it
he
would
cut
open
his
stomach
to
show
the
giant
that
he
had
eaten
it
without
chewing
it
the
giant
was
to
do
the
same
afterward
the
cobbler
of
course
secretly
tied
a
sack
about
his
neck
and
put
his
macaroni
in
it
then
he
took
a
knife
and
ripped
open
the
bag
and
the
macaroni
fell
out
the
giant
in
attempting
to
follow
the
cobbler
example
killed
himself
then
the
cobbler
cut
his
head
off
carried
it
to
the
king
and
claimed
his
daughter
hand
the
stories
given
in
this
chapter
constitute
as
we
have
already
said
in
the
introduction
but
a
small
part
of
italian
fairy
tales
they
represent
however
as
well
as
our
space
will
allow
the
great
fairy
cycles
so
to
speak
as
our
purpose
has
been
to
give
only
those
stories
which
have
been
taken
down
from
the
mouths
of
the
people
we
have
not
drawn
except
for
purposes
of
reference
upon
the
pentamerone
one
of
the
most
original
and
charming
collections
of
fairy
tales
in
any
language
enough
has
been
given
we
trust
to
show
how
the
italians
have
treated
the
themes
familiar
to
us
from
childhood
and
to
furnish
the
scholar
with
additional
material
for
comparison
chapter
ii
fairy
tales
continued
the
fairy
tales
given
in
the
last
chapter
belong
to
what
may
be
called
the
great
fairy
tale
cycles
that
is
to
extensive
classes
that
are
typical
forms
it
remains
to
notice
in
this
chapter
those
stories
which
do
not
belong
to
any
of
these
typical
classes
but
constitute
so
to
speak
independent
forms
the
reader
has
perhaps
noticed
in
the
fairy
tales
of
the
first
chapter
the
conspicuous
absence
of
the
fairies
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
german
or
celtic
stories
we
have
met
ogres
and
magicians
with
magic
powers
old
men
and
women
and
hermits
who
have
aided
the
hero
and
heroine
and
played
the
rôle
of
the
good
fairy
but
the
fairy
in
the
bright
shape
in
which
we
see
her
in
french
and
irish
stories
for
example
has
been
wanting
it
will
not
be
amiss
then
to
give
a
few
stories
in
which
the
fairies
play
a
more
important
part
we
shall
first
mention
a
curious
story
in
which
the
fairies
are
represented
in
one
of
their
most
usual
rôles
that
of
bestowing
good
gifts
the
story
is
from
sicily
gonz
no
and
is
entitled
xxv
the
king
who
wanted
a
beautiful
wife
there
was
once
a
king
who
wanted
to
marry
but
his
wife
must
be
more
beautiful
than
the
sun
and
no
matter
how
many
maidens
he
saw
none
was
beautiful
enough
to
suit
him
then
he
called
his
trusty
servant
and
commanded
him
to
seek
everywhere
and
see
whether
he
could
find
a
beautiful
girl
the
servant
set
out
and
wandered
through
the
whole
land
but
found
none
who
seemed
handsome
enough
to
him
one
day
however
after
he
had
run
about
a
great
deal
and
was
very
thirsty
he
came
to
a
little
house
he
knocked
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
now
there
dwelt
in
the
house
two
very
old
women
one
eighty
and
the
other
ninety
years
old
who
supported
themselves
by
spinning
when
the
servant
asked
for
water
the
one
eighty
years
old
rose
opened
a
little
wicket
in
the
shutter
and
handed
him
out
the
water
from
spinning
so
much
her
hands
were
very
white
and
delicate
and
when
the
servant
saw
them
he
thought
it
must
be
a
handsome
maiden
for
she
has
such
a
delicate
white
hand
so
he
hastened
to
the
king
and
said
your
royal
majesty
i
have
found
what
you
seek
so
and
so
has
happened
to
me
very
well
answered
the
king
go
once
more
and
try
to
see
her
the
servant
returned
to
the
little
house
knocked
and
asked
again
for
some
water
the
old
woman
did
not
open
the
window
but
handed
him
the
pitcher
through
the
little
opening
in
the
shutter
do
you
live
here
all
alone
asked
the
servant
no
she
answered
i
live
here
with
my
sister
we
are
poor
girls
and
support
ourselves
by
the
work
of
our
hands
how
old
are
you
then
i
am
fifteen
and
my
sister
twenty
the
servant
went
back
to
the
king
and
told
him
all
and
the
king
said
i
will
take
the
one
who
is
fifteen
go
and
bring
her
to
me
when
the
servant
returned
to
the
two
old
women
and
told
them
that
the
king
wished
to
elevate
the
younger
to
the
position
of
his
wife
she
answered
tell
the
king
i
am
ready
to
do
his
will
since
my
birth
no
ray
of
the
sun
has
ever
struck
me
and
if
a
ray
of
the
sun
or
a
beam
of
light
should
strike
me
now
i
would
become
perfectly
black
ask
the
king
therefore
to
send
a
closed
carriage
for
me
at
night
and
i
will
come
to
his
palace
when
the
king
heard
this
he
sent
royal
apparel
and
a
closed
carriage
and
at
night
the
old
woman
covered
her
face
with
a
thick
veil
and
rode
to
the
palace
the
king
received
her
joyfully
and
begged
her
to
lay
aside
the
veil
she
replied
there
are
too
many
lighted
candles
here
their
light
would
make
me
black
so
the
king
married
her
without
having
seen
her
face
when
they
came
into
the
king
chamber
however
and
she
removed
her
veil
the
king
saw
for
the
first
time
what
an
ugly
old
woman
he
had
married
and
in
his
rage
he
opened
the
window
and
threw
her
out
fortunately
there
was
a
nail
in
the
wall
on
which
she
caught
by
her
clothes
and
remained
hanging
between
heaven
and
earth
four
fairies
chanced
to
pass
by
and
when
they
saw
the
old
woman
hanging
there
one
of
them
cried
see
sisters
there
is
the
old
woman
who
cheated
the
king
shall
we
wish
her
dress
to
tear
and
let
her
fall
oh
no
let
us
not
do
that
cried
the
youngest
and
most
beautiful
of
the
fairies
let
us
rather
wish
her
something
good
i
wish
her
youth
and
i
beauty
and
i
prudence
and
i
a
good
heart
thus
the
fairies
cried
and
while
they
were
yet
speaking
the
old
woman
became
a
wondrous
fair
maiden
the
next
morning
when
the
king
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
beautiful
girl
hanging
there
he
was
terrified
and
thought
unhappy
man
what
have
i
done
had
i
no
eyes
last
night
then
he
had
her
carefully
taken
down
with
long
ladders
and
begged
her
pardon
saying
now
we
will
have
a
great
festival
and
be
right
happy
so
they
celebrated
a
splendid
feast
and
the
young
queen
was
the
fairest
in
the
whole
city
but
one
day
the
sister
ninety
years
old
came
to
the
palace
to
visit
the
queen
her
sister
who
is
this
ugly
creature
asked
the
king
an
old
neighbor
of
mine
who
is
replied
the
queen
quickly
the
old
woman
kept
looking
at
her
rejuvenated
sister
and
asked
what
did
you
do
to
become
so
young
and
lovely
i
too
would
like
to
be
young
and
pretty
again
she
kept
asking
this
the
whole
day
until
the
queen
finally
lost
her
patience
and
said
i
had
my
old
skin
taken
off
and
this
new
smooth
skin
came
to
light
the
old
woman
went
to
a
barber
and
said
i
will
give
you
what
you
will
to
remove
my
old
skin
so
that
i
may
become
young
and
handsome
again
but
good
old
woman
you
will
surely
die
if
i
skin
you
the
old
woman
would
not
listen
to
him
and
at
last
he
had
to
do
her
will
he
took
his
knife
and
made
a
cut
in
her
forehead
oh
cried
the
old
woman
who
will
look
fair
must
grief
and
pain
bear
answered
the
barber
then
skin
away
master
said
the
old
woman
the
barber
kept
cutting
on
until
all
at
once
the
old
woman
fell
down
dead
this
story
leads
quite
naturally
to
the
class
in
which
gifts
good
and
bad
are
bestowed
by
the
fairies
on
two
persons
one
of
whom
is
deserving
of
good
fortune
the
other
of
punishment
or
reproof
the
simplest
form
of
this
story
is
found
in
a
milanese
tale
xxvi
the
bucket
there
was
once
a
mother
who
had
two
daughters
one
was
bad
and
the
other
was
very
good
but
the
mother
loved
the
bad
one
more
than
the
good
one
she
said
one
day
to
the
bad
one
go
and
draw
a
bucket
of
water
the
bad
one
did
not
want
to
go
and
so
she
would
not
obey
her
mother
the
good
daughter
however
said
i
will
go
and
draw
it
she
went
to
draw
the
water
and
the
bucket
fell
down
the
well
she
said
if
i
go
home
now
without
the
bucket
who
knows
what
my
mother
will
do
to
me
so
she
climbed
down
the
well
and
at
the
bottom
found
a
narrow
passage
with
a
door
she
knocked
at
the
door
have
you
not
found
a
cord
and
bucket
there
was
a
saint
there
who
answered

my
child

continued
her
way
and
found
another
door
have
you
not
found
a
cord
and
bucket

was
the
devil
there
he
answered
her
angrily
because

good
girl
he
did
not
say

child
she
knocked
at
another
door
have
you
not
found
a

was
the
madonna

the
madonna
went
away
and
the
good
girl
put
the
house
in
order
gave
the
child
his
broth
swept
the
house
and
while
she
was
sweeping
instead
of
finding
dirt
she
found
coral
and
other
beautiful
things
she
saw
that
it
was
not
dirt
and
put
it
aside
to
give
the
madonna
when
she
returned
when
the
madonna
came
back
she
asked

dress
of
calico
or

girl

of
that
the
madonna
gave
her
the
silk
one

silver
one

brass

silver

here
is
the
bucket
and
your
cord

you
reach
the
end
of
this
passage

up
in
the
air
the
girl
did
so
and
a
beautiful
star
fell
on
her
brow
she
went
home
and
her
mother
ran
to
meet
her
to
scold
her
for
being
away
so
long
and
was
about
to
strike
her
when
she
saw
the
star
on
her
brow
which
shone
so
that
it
was
beautiful
to
see
and
said
where
have
you
been
until
now
who
put
that
thing
on
your
forehead
the
girl
answered
i
do
know
what
there
is
there
her
mother
tried
to
wash
it
away
but
instead
of
disappearing
it
shone
more
beautiful
than
ever
then
the
girl
told
what
had
happened
to
her
and
the
other
sister
wished
to
go
there
too
she
went
and
did
the
same
as
her
sister

looked
up
into
the
air
and
there
fell
on
her
forehead
a
lump
of
dirt
that
soiled
her
whole
face
she
went
home
in
a
rage
to
weep
and
scold
her
sister
because
she
had
had
the
star
while
she
had
that
dirt
on
her
face
her
mother
began
to
wash
her
face
and
rub
it
and
the
more
she
did
so
the
less
the
dirt
went
away
then
the
mother
said
i
understand
the
madonna
has
done
this
to
show
me
that
i
loved
the
bad
girl
and
neglected
the
good
one
in
other
versions
mentioned
in
the
note
to
the
above
story
the
two
sisters
receive
different
gifts
from
the
fairies
in
a
sicilian
tale
pitrè

washes
the
water
becomes
full
of

are
like

and
finally

can
finish
her
work
in
a
short
time
the
cousin

course
gifts
the
very
reverse
of
the
above
the
story
ends
with
the
trait
of
true
bride
mentioned
at
length
in
chapter
i
there
is
still
a
third
version
of
the
above
story
which
is
popular
in
many
lands
the
following
example
is
from
florence
and
is
entitled
xxvii
the
two
humpbacks
there
were
once
two
companions
who
were
humpbacks
but
one
more
so
than
the
other
they
were
both
so
poor
that
they
had
not
a
penny
to
their
names
one
of
them
said
i
will
go
out
into
the
world
for
here
there
is
nothing
to
eat
we
are
dying
of
hunger
i
want
to
see
whether
i
can
make
my
fortune
go
said
the
other
if
you
make
your
fortune
return
and
i
will
go
and
see
if
i
can
make
mine
so
the
humpback
set
off
on
his
journey
now
these
two
humpbacks
were
from
parma
when
the
humpback
had
gone
a
long
way
he
came
to
a
square
where
there
was
a
fair
at
which
everything
was
sold
there
was
a
person
selling
cheese
who
cried
out
eat
the
little
parmesan
the
poor
humpback
thought
he
meant
him
so
he
ran
away
and
hid
himself
in
a
when
it
was
one
he
heard
a
clanking
of
chains
and
the
words
saturday
and
sunday
repeated
several
times
then
he
answered
and
monday
oh
heavens
said
they
who
were
singing
who
is
this
who
has
harmonized
with
our
choir
they
searched
and
found
the
poor
humpback
hidden
o
gentlemen
he
said
i
have
not
come
here
to
do
any
harm
you
know
well
we
have
come
to
reward
you
you
have
harmonized
our
choir
come
with
us
they
put
him
on
a
table
and
removed
his
hump
healed
him
and
gave
him
two
bags
of
money
now
they
said
you
can
go
he
thanked
them
and
went
away
without
his
hump
he
liked
it
better
you
can
believe
he
returned
to
his
place
at
parma
and
when
the
other
humpback
saw
him
he
exclaimed
does
not
that
look
just
like
my
friend
but
he
had
a
hump

is
not
he
listen

are
not

friend

and
so
are
you
yes

am
he
replied

not
a
humpback

have
removed
my
hump
and
given
me
two
bags
of
money
i
will
tell
you
why
i
reached
he
continued
such
and
such
a
place
and
i
heard
them
beginning
to
say
the
little
parmesan
eat
the
little
parmesan
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
hid
myself
he
mentioned
the
place
in
a
at
a
certain
hour
i
heard
a
noise
of
chains
and
a
chorus
singing
and
after
two
or
three
times
i
said
they
came
and
found
me
saying
that
i
had
harmonized
their
chorus
and
they
wanted
to
reward
me
they
took
me
removed
my
hump
and
gave
me
two
bags
of
money
oh
heavens
said
the
other
humpback
i
want
to
go
there
too
go
poor
fellow
go
farewell
the
humpback
reached
the
place
and
hid
himself
precisely
where
his
companion
had
after
a
while
he
heard
a
noise
of
chains
and
the
chorus
saturday
and
sunday
then
another
chorus
and
monday
after
the
humpback
had
heard
them
repeat
saturday
and
sunday
and
monday
several
times
he
added
and
tuesday
where
they
exclaimed
is
he
who
has
spoiled
our
chorus
if
we
find
him
we
will
tear
him
in
pieces
just
think
they
struck
and
beat
this
poor
humpback
until
they
were
tired
then
they
put
him
on
the
same
table
on
which
they
had
placed
his
companion
and
said
take
that
hump
and
put
it
on
him
in
front
so
they
took
the
other
hump
and
fastened
it
to
his
breast
and
then
drove
him
away
with
blows
he
went
home
and
found
his
friend
who
cried
mercy
is
not
that
my
friend
but
it
can
not
be
for
this
one
is
humpbacked
in
front
listen
he
said
are
you
not
my
friend
the
same
he
answered
weeping
i
did
not
want
to
bear
my
own
hump
and
now
i
have
to
carry
mine
and
yours
and
so
beaten
and
reduced
you
see
come
said
his
friend
come
home
with
me
and
we
will
eat
a
mouthful
together
and
do
be
disheartened
and
so
every
day
he
dined
with
his
friend
and
afterward
they
died
i
imagine
there
are
a
number
of
sicilian
stories
in
which
one
fate
is
personified
and
appears
in
the
rôle
of
a
guardian
angel
or
good
and
bad
fairy
in
the
same
way
fortune
is
personified
in
several
stories
the
best
example
of
the
former
class
which
has
also
a
point
of
contact
with
the
latter
is
found
in
gonzenbach
no
and
is
entitled
xxviii
the
story
of
catherine
and
her
fate
there
was
once
a
merchant
who
was
very
rich
and
had
greater
treasures
than
the
king
in
his
reception
room
stood
three
wonderfully
beautiful
seats
one
was
of
silver
the
second
of
gold
and
the
third
of
diamonds
this
merchant
had
an
only
daughter
whose
name
was
catherine
and
who
was
fairer
than
the
sun
one
day
as
catherine
was
sitting
in
her
chamber
the
door
suddenly
opened
of
itself
and
there
entered
a
tall
beautiful
lady
who
held
in
her
hand
a
wheel
catherine
said
she
when
would
you
rather
enjoy
your
life
in
youth
or
in
old
age
catherine
gazed
at
her
in
amazement
and
could
make
no
answer
the
beautiful
lady
again
asked
catherine
when
would
you
rather
enjoy
your
life
in
youth
or
in
old
age
then
thought
catherine
if
i
say
in
youth
i
must
suffer
for
it
in
old
age
wherefore
i
will
rather
enjoy
my
life
in
old
age
and
in
youth
will
be
done
so
she
answered
in
old
age
be
it
as
you
have
wished
said
the
beautiful
woman
turned
her
wheel
once
and
disappeared
now
this
beautiful
tall
lady
was
poor
catherine
fate
a
few
days
later
her
father
suddenly
received
news
that
some
of
his
ships
had
been
wrecked
in
a
storm
a
few
days
after
he
learned
that
several
more
of
his
ships
had
foundered
and
to
cut
the
matter
short
scarcely
a
month
had
passed
when
he
was
himself
deprived
of
all
his
riches
he
had
to
sell
all
that
he
had
and
this
too
he
lost
until
at
last
he
remained
poor
and
wretched
from
grief
he
fell
ill
and
died
so
poor
catherine
remained
all
alone
in
the
world
without
a
penny
and
with
no
one
to
give
her
shelter
she
thought
i
will
go
to
another
city
and
seek
me
a
place
there
so
she
set
out
and
walked
until
she
came
to
another
city
as
she
was
going
through
the
streets
a
noble
lady
happened
to
be
standing
by
the
window
and
asked
her
where
are
you
going
all
alone
pretty
maiden
ah
noble
lady
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
would
like
to
find
a
place
to
earn
my
bread
can
you
not
find
use
for
me
so
the
noble
lady
received
her
and
catherine
served
her
faithfully
some
days
later
the
lady
said
one
evening
catherine
i
must
go
out
for
a
time
and
will
lock
the
house
door
very
well
said
catherine
and
after
her
mistress
had
gone
she
took
her
work
and
sat
down
and
sewed
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
her
fate
entered
so
she
cried
are
you
here
catherine
and
do
you
think
now
that
i
am
going
to
leave
you
in
peace
with
these
words
her
fate
ran
to
all
the
cupboards
dragged
out
the
linen
and
clothes
of
catherine
mistress
and
tore
everything
into
a
thousand
pieces
catherine
thought
woe
is
me
if
my
mistress
returns
and
finds
everything
in
this
condition
she
will
certainly
kill
me
and
in
her
anguish
she
opened
the
door
and
fled
her
fate
however
gathered
up
all
the
torn
and
ruined
things
made
them
whole
and
laid
them
away
in
their
places
when
the
mistress
returned
she
called
catherine
but
catherine
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
can
she
have
robbed
me
she
thought
but
when
she
looked
about
nothing
was
gone
she
was
very
much
astonished
but
catherine
did
not
return
but
hastened
on
until
she
came
to
another
city
as
she
was
passing
through
the
streets
another
lady
standing
by
the
window
asked
her
where
are
you
going
all
alone
pretty
maiden
ah
noble
lady
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
would
like
a
place
to
earn
my
bread
can
you
not
make
use
of
me
then
the
lady
took
her
in
and
catherine
served
her
and
thought
now
she
could
rest
in
peace
it
lasted
however
but
a
few
days
one
evening
when
her
mistress
was
out
her
fate
appeared
again
and
addressed
her
harshly
so
here
you
are
now
do
you
think
you
can
escape
me
then
the
fate
tore
and
destroyed
everything
that
it
found
so
that
poor
catherine
again
fled
in
her
anguish
of
heart
to
cut
the
matter
short
poor
catherine
led
this
frightful
life
seven
years
flying
from
one
city
to
another
and
everywhere
attempting
to
find
a
place
her
fate
always
appeared
after
a
few
days
and
tore
and
destroyed
her
employers
things
so
that
the
poor
girl
had
to
flee
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
house
the
fate
restored
everything
and
put
it
in
its
place
finally
after
seven
years
her
fate
seemed
weary
of
always
persecuting
the
unfortunate
catherine
one
day
catherine
came
again
to
a
city
and
saw
a
lady
standing
at
a
window
who
asked
her
where
are
you
going
all
alone
pretty
girl
ah
noble
lady
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
would
like
to
find
a
place
to
earn
my
bread
can
you
not
find
use
for
me
the
lady
answered
i
will
give
you
a
place
willingly
but
you
must
perform
daily
a
service
and
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
strength
for
it
tell
me
what
it
is
said
catherine
and
if
i
can
i
will
do
it
do
you
see
yonder
high
mountain
asked
the
lady
every
morning
you
must
carry
up
there
a
large
board
covered
with
fresh
bread
and
cry
with
a
loud
voice
my
mistress
fate
o
my
mistress
fate
o
my
fate
thrice
then
my
fate
will
appear
and
receive
the
bread
i
will
do
that
willingly
said
catherine
and
the
lady
took
her
into
her
service
now
catherine
remained
years
with
this
lady
and
every
morning
she
took
a
board
with
fresh
bread
and
carried
it
up
the
mountain
and
when
she
had
called
three
times
o
my
mistress
fate
there
appeared
a
beautiful
tall
lady
who
received
the
bread
catherine
often
wept
when
she
thought
that
she
who
had
once
been
so
rich
must
now
serve
like
a
poor
maid
one
day
her
mistress
said
to
her
catherine
why
do
you
weep
so
much
then
catherine
told
her
how
ill
it
had
fared
with
her
and
her
mistress
said
i
will
tell
you
what
catherine
when
you
take
the
bread
to
the
mountain
ask
my
fate
to
try
and
persuade
your
fate
to
leave
you
now
in
peace
perhaps
that
will
do
some
good
this
advice
pleased
poor
catherine
and
the
next
morning
after
she
had
taken
the
bread
to
her
mistress
fate
she
disclosed
her
trouble
to
her
and
said
o
my
mistress
fate
beg
my
fate
to
persecute
me
no
longer
then
the
fate
answered
ah
poor
girl
your
fate
is
just
now
covered
with
seven
coverlets
so
that
she
can
not
hear
you
but
when
you
come
i
will
take
you
to
her
after
catherine
had
returned
home
her
fate
went
to
the
young
girl
fate
and
said
dear
sister
why
are
you
never
weary
of
making
poor
catherine
suffer
permit
her
again
to
see
some
happy
days
the
fate
answered
bring
her
to
me
and
i
will
give
her
something
that
will
help
her
out
of
all
her
trouble
when
catherine
brought
the
bread
the
next
morning
her
mistress
fate
conducted
her
to
her
own
fate
who
was
covered
with
seven
coverlets
her
fate
gave
her
a
small
skein
of
silk
and
said
preserve
it
carefully
it
will
be
of
use
to
you
then
catherine
went
home
and
said
to
her
mistress
my
fate
has
given
me
a
little
skein
of
silk
what
shall
i
do
with
it
it
is
not
worth
three
well
said
her
mistress
preserve
it
who
knows
of
what
use
it
may
be
now
it
happened
some
time
after
this
that
the
young
king
was
to
marry
and
on
that
account
had
royal
garments
made
for
himself
as
the
tailor
was
about
to
sew
a
beautiful
dress
there
was
no
silk
of
the
same
color
to
be
found
so
the
king
proclaimed
throughout
the
whole
land
that
whoever
had
such
silk
should
bring
it
to
the
court
and
would
be
well
rewarded
catherine
said
her
mistress
your
skein
is
of
that
color
take
it
to
the
king
so
that
he
may
make
you
a
handsome
present
then
catherine
put
on
her
best
clothes
and
went
to
the
court
and
when
she
appeared
before
the
king
she
was
so
beautiful
that
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
her
royal
majesty
said
she
i
have
brought
you
a
little
skein
of
silk
of
the
color
that
could
not
be
found
i
will
tell
you
what
royal
majesty
cried
one
of
his
ministers
we
will
pay
the
maiden
for
the
silk
with
its
weight
in
gold
the
king
was
satisfied
and
they
brought
a
balance
in
one
scale
the
king
laid
the
silk
in
the
other
a
gold
coin
now
just
imagine
what
happened
no
matter
how
many
gold
coins
the
king
laid
in
the
scale
the
silk
was
always
heavier
then
the
king
had
a
larger
balance
brought
and
threw
all
his
treasures
into
the
scale
but
the
silk
still
weighed
the
more
then
the
king
at
last
took
his
crown
from
his
head
and
placed
it
with
all
the
other
treasures
and
behold
the
scale
with
gold
sank
and
weighed
exactly
as
much
as
the
silk
where
did
you
get
this
silk
asked
the
king
royal
majesty
it
was
a
present
from
my
mistress
answered
catherine
no
that
is
impossible
cried
the
king
if
you
do
not
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
have
your
head
cut
off
then
catherine
related
all
that
had
happened
to
her
since
she
was
a
rich
maiden
now
there
lived
at
the
court
a
wise
lady
who
said
catherine
you
have
suffered
much
but
you
will
now
see
happy
days
and
that
it
was
not
until
the
golden
crown
was
put
in
the
scale
that
the
balance
was
even
is
a
sign
that
you
will
be
a
queen
if
she
is
to
be
a
queen
cried
the
king
i
will
make
her
one
for
catherine
and
none
other
shall
be
my
wife
and
so
it
was
the
king
informed
his
betrothed
that
he
no
longer
wished
her
and
married
the
fair
catherine
and
after
catherine
in
her
youth
had
suffered
so
much
she
enjoyed
nothing
but
happiness
in
her
old
age
and
was
happy
and
contented
in
the
class
of
stories
of
which
the
bucket
is
an
example
we
have
seen
the
good
sister
rewarded
and
the
naughty
one
punished
another
moral
story
is
the
one
in
which
a
king
daughter
is
punished
for
her
pride
in
refusing
to
marry
a
suitable
lover
by
being
made
to
marry
the
first
one
who
asks
her
hand
this
is
the
case
in
the
grimm
story
king
or
rather
the
king
gives
his
proud
daughter
to
the
first
beggar
who
comes
to
the
palace
gate
the
same
occurs
in
one
of
the
italian
versions
of
this
story
but
usually
the
haughty
princess
after
refusing
a
noble
suitor
either
falls
in
love
with
the
same
suitor
who
has
disguised
himself
as
a
person
of
ignoble
rank
or
she
sells
herself
to
the
disguised
lover
for
some
finery
with
which
he
tempts
her
at
all
events
her
pride
is
thoroughly
humbled
an
example
of
the
more
common
version
is
found
in
bolognese
tales
no
and
is
as
follows
xxix
the
crumb
in
the
beard
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
a
daughter
whose
name
was
stella
she
was
indescribably
beautiful
but
was
so
whimsical
and
hard
to
please
that
she
drove
her
father
to
despair
there
had
been
princes
and
kings
who
had
sought
her
in
marriage
but
she
had
found
defects
in
them
all
and
would
have
none
of
them
she
kept
advancing
in
years
and
her
father
began
to
despair
of
knowing
to
whom
he
should
leave
his
crown
so
he
summoned
his
council
and
discussed
the
matter
and
was
advised
to
give
a
great
banquet
to
which
he
should
invite
all
the
princes
and
kings
of
the
surrounding
countries
for
as
they
said
there
can
not
fail
to
be
among
so
many
some
one
who
should
please
the
princess
who
was
to
hide
behind
a
door
so
that
she
could
examine
them
all
as
she
pleased
when
the
king
heard
this
advice
he
gave
the
orders
necessary
for
the
banquet
and
then
called
his
daughter
and
said
listen
my
little
stella
i
have
thought
to
do
so
and
so
to
see
if
i
can
find
any
one
to
please
you
behold
my
daughter
my
hair
is
white
and
i
must
have
some
one
to
leave
my
crown
to
stella
bowed
her
head
saying
that
she
would
take
care
to
please
him
princes
and
kings
then
began
to
arrive
at
the
court
and
when
it
was
time
for
the
banquet
they
all
seated
themselves
at
the
table
you
can
imagine
what
sort
of
a
banquet
that
was
and
how
the
hall
was
adorned
gold
and
silver
shone
from
all
their
necks
in
the
four
corners
of
the
room
were
four
fountains
which
continually
sent
forth
wine
and
the
most
exquisite
perfumes
while
the
gentlemen
were
eating
stella
was
behind
a
door
as
has
been
said
and
one
of
her
maids
who
was
near
by
pointed
out
to
her
now
this
one
now
that
one
see
your
majesty
what
a
handsome
youth
that
is
there
yes
but
he
has
too
large
a
nose
and
the
one
near
your
father
he
has
eyes
that
look
like
saucers
and
that
other
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
has
too
large
a
mouth
he
looks
as
if
he
liked
to
eat
in
short
she
found
fault
with
all
but
one
who
she
said
pleased
her
but
that
he
must
be
a
very
dirty
fellow
for
he
had
a
crumb
on
his
beard
after
eating
the
youth
heard
her
say
this
and
swore
vengeance
you
must
know
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
king
of
green
hill
and
the
handsomest
youth
that
could
be
seen
when
the
banquet
was
finished
and
the
guests
had
departed
the
king
called
stella
and
asked
what
news
have
you
my
child
she
replied
that
the
only
one
who
pleased
her
was
the
one
with
the
crumb
in
his
beard
but
that
she
believed
him
to
be
a
dirty
fellow
and
did
not
want
him
take
care
my
daughter
you
will
repent
it
answered
her
father
and
turned
away
you
must
know
that
stella
chamber
looked
into
a
into
which
opened
the
shop
of
a
baker
one
night
while
she
was
preparing
to
retire
she
heard
in
the
room
where
they
sifted
the
meal
some
one
singing
so
well
and
with
so
much
grace
that
it
went
to
her
heart
she
ran
to
the
window
and
listened
until
he
finished
then
she
began
to
ask
her
maid
who
the
person
with
the
beautiful
voice
could
be
saying
she
would
like
to
know
leave
it
to
me
your
majesty
said
the
maid
i
will
inform
you
stella
could
not
wait
for
the
next
day
and
indeed
early
the
next
day
she
learned
that
the
one
who
sang
was
the
sifter
that
evening
she
heard
him
sing
again
and
stood
by
the
window
until
everything
became
quiet
but
that
voice
had
so
touched
her
heart
that
she
told
her
maid
that
the
next
day
she
would
try
and
see
who
had
that
fine
voice
in
the
morning
she
placed
herself
by
the
window
and
soon
saw
the
youth
come
forth
she
was
enchanted
by
his
beauty
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
and
fell
desperately
in
love
with
him
now
you
must
know
that
this
was
none
other
than
the
prince
who
was
at
the
banquet
and
whom
stella
had
called
dirty
so
he
had
disguised
himself
in
such
a
way
that
she
could
not
recognize
him
and
was
meanwhile
preparing
his
revenge
after
he
had
seen
her
once
or
twice
he
began
to
take
off
his
hat
and
salute
her
she
smiled
at
him
and
appeared
at
the
window
every
moment
then
they
began
to
exchange
words
and
in
the
evening
he
sang
under
her
window
in
short
they
began
to
make
love
in
good
earnest
and
when
he
learned
that
she
was
free
he
began
to
talk
about
marrying
her
she
consented
at
once
but
asked
him
what
he
had
to
live
on
i
have
a
penny
said
he
the
little
i
earn
is
hardly
enough
to
feed
me
stella
encouraged
him
saying
that
she
would
give
him
all
the
money
and
things
he
wanted
to
punish
stella
for
her
pride
her
father
and
the
prince
father
had
an
understanding
and
pretended
not
to
know
about
this
love
affair
and
let
her
carry
away
from
the
palace
all
she
owned
during
the
day
stella
did
nothing
but
make
a
great
bundle
of
clothes
of
silver
and
of
money
and
at
night
the
disguised
prince
came
under
the
balcony
and
she
threw
it
down
to
him
things
went
on
in
this
manner
some
time
and
finally
one
evening
he
said
to
her
listen
the
time
has
come
to
elope
stella
could
not
wait
for
the
hour
and
the
next
night
she
quietly
tied
a
cord
about
her
and
let
herself
down
from
the
window
the
prince
aided
her
to
the
ground
and
then
took
her
arm
and
hastened
away
he
led
her
a
long
ways
to
another
city
where
he
turned
down
a
street
and
opened
the
first
door
he
met
they
went
down
a
long
passage
finally
they
reached
a
little
door
which
he
opened
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
hole
of
a
place
which
had
only
one
window
high
up
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
straw
bed
a
bench
and
a
dirty
table
you
can
imagine
that
when
stella
saw
herself
in
this
place
she
thought
she
should
die
when
the
prince
saw
her
so
amazed
he
said
what
is
the
matter
does
the
house
not
please
you
do
you
not
know
that
i
am
a
poor
man
have
you
been
deceived
what
have
you
done
with
all
the
things
i
gave
you
oh
i
had
many
debts
and
i
have
paid
them
and
then
i
have
done
with
the
rest
what
seemed
good
to
me
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
work
and
gain
your
bread
as
i
have
done
you
must
know
that
i
am
a
porter
of
the
king
of
this
city
and
i
often
go
and
work
at
the
palace
they
have
told
me
the
washing
is
to
be
done
so
you
must
rise
early
and
go
with
me
there
i
will
set
you
to
work
with
the
other
women
and
when
it
is
time
for
them
to
go
home
to
dinner
you
will
say
that
you
are
not
hungry
and
while
you
are
alone
steal
two
shirts
conceal
them
under
your
skirt
and
carry
them
home
to
me
poor
stella
wept
bitterly
saying
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
do
that
but
her
husband
replied
do
what
i
say
or
i
shall
beat
you
the
next
morning
her
husband
rose
with
the
dawn
and
made
her
get
up
too
he
had
bought
her
a
striped
skirt
and
a
pair
of
coarse
shoes
which
he
made
her
put
on
and
then
took
her
to
the
palace
with
him
conducted
her
to
the
laundry
and
left
her
after
he
had
introduced
her
as
his
wife
saying
that
she
should
remember
what
awaited
her
at
home
then
the
prince
ran
and
dressed
himself
like
a
king
and
waited
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
until
it
was
time
for
his
wife
to
come
meanwhile
poor
stella
did
as
her
husband
had
commanded
and
stole
the
shirts
as
she
was
leaving
the
palace
she
met
the
king
who
said
pretty
girl
you
are
our
porter
wife
are
you
not
then
he
asked
her
what
she
had
under
her
skirt
and
shook
her
until
the
shirts
dropped
out
and
the
king
cried
see
there
the
porter
wife
is
a
thief
she
has
stolen
some
shirts
poor
stella
ran
home
in
tears
and
her
husband
followed
her
when
he
had
put
on
his
disguise
again
when
he
reached
home
stella
told
him
all
that
had
happened
and
begged
him
not
to
send
her
to
the
palace
again
but
he
told
her
that
the
next
day
they
were
to
bake
and
she
must
go
into
the
kitchen
and
help
and
steal
a
piece
of
dough
everything
happened
as
on
the
previous
day
stella
theft
was
discovered
and
when
her
husband
returned
he
found
her
crying
like
a
condemned
soul
and
swearing
that
she
had
rather
be
killed
than
go
to
the
palace
again
he
told
her
however
that
the
king
son
was
to
be
married
the
next
day
and
that
there
was
to
be
a
great
banquet
and
she
must
go
into
the
kitchen
and
wash
the
dishes
he
added
that
when
she
had
the
chance
she
must
steal
a
pot
of
broth
and
hide
it
about
her
so
that
no
one
should
see
it
she
had
to
do
as
she
was
told
and
had
scarcely
concealed
the
pot
when
the
king
son
came
into
the
kitchen
and
told
his
wife
she
must
come
to
the
ball
that
had
followed
the
banquet
she
did
not
wish
to
go
but
he
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
into
the
midst
of
the
festival
imagine
how
the
poor
woman
felt
at
that
ball
dressed
as
she
was
and
with
the
pot
of
broth
the
king
began
to
poke
his
sword
at
her
in
jest
until
he
hit
the
pot
and
all
the
broth
ran
on
the
floor
then
all
began
to
jeer
her
and
laugh
until
poor
stella
fainted
away
from
shame
and
they
had
to
go
and
get
some
vinegar
to
revive
her
at
last
the
king
mother
came
forward
and
said
enough
you
have
revenged
yourself
sufficiently
then
turning
to
stella
know
that
this
is
your
mother
and
that
he
has
done
this
to
correct
your
pride
and
to
be
avenged
on
you
for
calling
him
dirty
then
she
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
to
another
room
where
her
maids
dressed
her
as
a
queen
her
father
and
mother
then
appeared
and
kissed
and
embraced
her
her
husband
begged
her
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
and
they
made
peace
and
always
lived
in
harmony
from
that
day
on
she
was
never
haughty
and
had
learned
to
her
cost
that
pride
is
the
greatest
fault
a
curious
feature
in
italian
stories
is
the
part
played
by
dolls
or
puppets
they
sometimes
serve
to
represent
an
absent
mistress
or
to
take
her
place
and
receive
the
brunt
of
the
husband
anger
the
most
peculiar
of
these
are
found
in
the
south
of
italy
the
one
that
follows
is
from
naples
and
is
entitled
xxx
the
fairy
orlanda
there
was
once
a
merchant
who
had
no
children
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
for
merchandise
his
wife
said
to
him
here
is
a
ring

it
on
your
finger

must
bring
me
a
doll
as
large
as

continued
its
way
on

arrival

and
elegant
it
seemed
like
a
very
handsome
young
girl
his
wife
well
pleased
talked
to
the
doll
and
they
both
worked
near
the
balcony

beautiful
that

enamored

with
the
king
and
queen
but
did
not
speak
to
the
prince
the
mortified
prince
thought
she
speaks
to
papa
she
speaks
to
mamma
but
not
to
me
what
does
it
mean
perhaps
she
does
not
speak
to
me
from
embarrassment
they
were
married
but
even
then
she
did
not
speak
to
him
so
the
prince
was
obliged
to
separate
from
her
and
they
lived
in
two
rooms
apart
the
prince
meanwhile
courted
another
princess
one
morning
while
he
was
breakfasting
with
his
sweetheart
his
wife
called
a
servant

cut
off
her
two

the
servant
replied

put
them
in
the
oven
she
amazed
me
enough
said
the
prince

his
sweetheart
said

do
it
too
so
she
cut
off
her
hands
and
put
them
in
the
oven
but
they
were
burned
and
she
died
oh

have

to
me

said
the
prince
after
a
time
he
made
love
to
another
the
first
time
he
sat
at
table
with
her
the
princess
called
another
servant

i
do

but

me

you
well

so
the
servant
told
how
the
princess
had
cut
off
her
arms
which
had
grown
out
again
and
put
them
in
the
oven
and
the
roast
and
puddings
had
come
out
the
second
sweetheart
tried
to
do
the
same
and
died
after
a
while
the
prince
fell
in
love
with
another
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
the
princess
cut
off
her
legs
and
put
them
in
the
oven
and
a
large
roast
came
out
with
two
larded
hams
the
third
sweetheart
tried
to
do
the
same
and
died
like
the
others
then
the
prince
said
ah
she
has
done
it
to
three
for
me
unhappy
me
i
will
not
make
love
to
any
more
during
the
night
when
the
princess
had
gone
to
bed
the
lamp
said
lady
i
want
to
drink
give
the
lamp
a
drink
lady
it
has
hurt
me
why
did
you
hurt
the
lamp
how
beautiful
is
the
fairy
orlanda
how
beautiful
is
the
fairy
orlanda
how
beautiful
is
the
fairy
orlanda
so
she
did
all
night
until
day
all
these
things
were
enchanted
the
lamp
and
the
the
prince
who
heard
it
said
one
day
to
a
servant
this
evening
you
must
enter
the
room
you
must
spend
the
night
under
her
bed
you
must
see
what
she
does
in
the
night
the
servant
did
so
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
with
the
lamp
and
the
the
servant
told
the
prince
who
said
i
will
go
at
night
he
crept
under
his
wife
bed
the
same
thing
was
repeated
the
lamp
said
lady
i
want
to
drink
give
the
lamp
a
drink
lady
it
has
hurt
me
why
have
you
hurt
the
lamp
how
beautiful
is
the
fairy
orlanda
the
whole
night
she
repeated
how
beautiful
is
the
fairy
orlanda
the
prince
responded
blessed
be
the
fairy
orlanda
ah
said
the
princess
did
it
need
so
much
to
say
a
word
then
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
and
remained
contented
and
happy
we
now
pass
to
an
amusing
class
of
stories
in
which
the
hero
comes
in
possession
of
enchanted
objects
and
loses
them
finally
regaining
them
in
various
ways
there
are
three
versions
of
this
class
in
the
first
the
hero
loses
the
objects
by
the
cunning
of
a
woman
and
regains
them
by
means
of
two
kinds
of
fruits
one
of
which
produces
some
bodily
defect
and
the
other
cures
it
in
the
second
the
episode
of
the
fruits
is
wanting
and
the
owner
regains
his
property
either
by
preventing
the
princess
from
cheating
him
at
play
or
by
making
her
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
third
a
person
usually
a
landlord
substitutes
worthless
objects
for
two
enchanted
ones
which
are
recovered
by
means
of
a
third
magic
object
usually
a
stick
which
beats
until
the
stolen
property
is
restored
to
illustrate
the
first
version
we
will
give
a
sicilian
story
from
gonzenbach
no
which
is
entitled
xxxi
the
shepherd
who
made
the
king
daughter
laugh
there
was
once
a
king
and
a
queen
who
had
an
only
daughter
whom
they
loved
very
dearly
when
she
was
fifteen
years
old
she
became
suddenly
very
sad
and
would
not
laugh
any
more
so
the
king
issued
a
proclamation
that
whoever
made
his
daughter
laugh
whether
he
were
a
prince
peasant
or
beggar
should
become
her
husband
many
made
the
attempt
but
none
succeeded
now
there
was
a
poor
woman
who
had
an
only
son
who
was
idle
and
would
not
learn
any
trade
so
finally
his
mother
sent
him
to
a
farmer
to
keep
his
sheep
one
day
as
he
was
driving
the
sheep
over
the
fields
he
came
to
a
well
and
bent
over
it
to
drink
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
handsome
ring
on
the
wheel
and
as
it
pleased
him
he
put
it
on
the
ring
finger
of
his
right
hand
he
had
scarcely
put
it
on
however
when
he
began
to
sneeze
violently
and
could
not
stop
until
he
had
accidentally
removed
the
ring
then
his
sneezing
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
oh
thought
he
if
the
ring
has
this
virtue
i
had
better
try
my
fortune
with
it
and
see
whether
it
will
not
make
the
king
daughter
laugh
so
he
put
the
ring
on
his
left
hand
and
no
longer
had
to
sneeze
then
he
drove
the
sheep
home
took
leave
of
his
master
and
set
out
toward
the
city
where
the
king
lived
he
was
obliged
however
to
pass
through
a
dense
forest
which
was
so
extensive
that
it
grew
dark
before
he
left
it
he
thought
if
the
robbers
find
me
here
they
will
take
away
my
ring
and
then
i
should
be
a
ruined
man
i
would
rather
climb
a
tree
and
spend
the
night
there
so
he
climbed
a
tree
tied
himself
fast
with
his
belt
and
soon
fell
asleep
before
long
thirteen
robbers
came
and
sat
down
under
the
tree
and
talked
so
loud
that
the
shepherd
awoke
the
captain
of
the
robbers
said
let
each
relate
what
he
has
accomplished
and
each
exhibited
what
he
had
taken
the
thirteenth
however
pulled
out
a
tablecloth
a
purse
and
a
whistle
and
said
i
have
gained
the
greatest
treasures
for
these
three
things
i
have
taken
from
a
monk
and
each
of
them
has
a
particular
virtue
if
any
one
spreads
out
the
tablecloth
and
says
little
tablecloth
give
me
macaroni
or
roast
meat
or
whatever
one
will
he
will
find
everything
there
immediately
likewise
the
purse
will
give
all
the
money
one
wants
and
whoever
hears
the
whistle
must
dance
whether
he
will
or
no
the
robbers
at
once
put
the
power
of
the
tablecloth
to
the
test
and
then
went
to
sleep
the
captain
laying
the
precious
articles
near
himself
when
they
were
all
snoring
hard
the
shepherd
descended
took
the
three
articles
and
crept
away
the
next
day
he
came
to
the
city
where
the
king
lived
and
went
straight
to
the
palace
announce
me
to
the
king
said
he
to
the
servants
i
will
try
to
make
the
king
daughter
laugh
the
servants
tried
to
dissuade
him
but
he
insisted
on
being
led
before
the
king
who
took
him
into
a
large
room
in
which
was
the
king
daughter
sitting
on
a
splendid
throne
and
surrounded
by
the
whole
court
if
i
am
to
make
the
princess
laugh
said
the
shepherd
to
the
king
you
must
first
do
me
the
kindness
to
put
this
ring
on
the
of
your
right
hand
the
king
had
scarcely
done
so
when
he
began
to
sneeze
violently
and
could
not
stop
but
ran
up
and
down
the
room
sneezing
all
the
time
the
entire
court
began
to
laugh
and
the
king
daughter
could
not
stay
sober
but
had
to
run
away
laughing
then
the
shepherd
went
up
to
the
king
took
off
the
ring
and
said
your
majesty
i
have
made
the
princess
laugh
to
me
belongs
the
reward
what
you
worthless
shepherd
cried
the
king
you
have
not
only
made
me
the
of
the
whole
court
but
now
you
want
my
daughter
for
your
wife
quick
take
the
ring
from
him
and
throw
him
into
prison
while
there
the
wonderful
tablecloth
provides
him
and
his
companions
with
plenty
to
eat
and
when
it
is
discovered
and
taken
from
him
by
the
king
orders
the
purse
enables
them
all
to
live
in
comfort
that
is
also
discovered
and
nothing
is
left
but
the
whistle
well
thought
the
shepherd
if
we
ca
eat
any
more
we
will
at
least
dance
and
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
began
to
play
on
it
and
all
the
prisoners
began
to
dance
and
the
guards
with
them
and
between
them
all
they
made
a
great
noise
when
the
king
heard
it
he
came
running
there
with
his
servants
and
had
to
dance
like
all
the
rest
but
found
breath
enough
to
order
the
pipe
to
be
taken
away
from
the
shepherd
and
all
became
quiet
again
so
now
the
shepherd
had
nothing
left
and
remained
in
prison
some
time
until
he
found
an
old
file
and
one
night
filed
through
the
iron
bars
and
escaped
he
wandered
about
all
day
and
at
last
came
to
the
same
forest
where
he
had
formerly
been
all
at
once
he
saw
a
large
bearing
the
most
beautiful
fruit
on
one
side
black
figs
on
the
other
white
ones
that
is
something
i
have
never
seen
thought
the
shepherd
a
that
bears
black
and
white
figs
at
the
same
time
i
must
try
them
scarcely
had
he
tasted
them
when
he
felt
something
move
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
putting
his
hand
up
found
he
had
two
long
horns
unhappy
man
he
cried
what
shall
i
do
however
as
he
was
very
hungry
he
picked
some
of
the
white
figs
and
ate
them
and
immediately
one
of
the
horns
disappeared
and
also
the
other
after
he
had
eaten
a
few
more
white
figs
my
fortune
is
made
he
thought
the
king
will
have
to
give
me
all
my
things
back
and
his
daughter
in
the
bargain
the
shepherd
disguised
himself
and
went
to
the
city
with
two
baskets
of
figs
one
of
the
black
and
one
of
the
white
kind
the
former
of
which
he
sold
to
the
king
cook
whom
he
met
in
the
market
place
while
the
king
was
at
the
table
the
servant
put
the
figs
before
him
and
he
was
much
pleased
with
them
and
gave
some
to
his
wife
and
daughter
the
rest
he
ate
himself
scarcely
had
they
eaten
them
when
they
saw
with
terror
the
long
horns
that
had
grown
from
their
heads
the
queen
and
her
daughter
began
to
weep
and
the
king
in
a
rage
called
the
cook
and
asked
him
who
had
sold
him
the
figs
a
peasant
in
the
market
answered
the
cook
go
at
once
and
bring
him
here
cried
the
king
the
shepherd
had
remained
near
the
palace
and
as
the
cook
came
out
he
went
up
to
him
with
the
basket
of
white
figs
in
his
hand
what
miserable
figs
did
you
sell
me
this
morning
cried
out
the
cook
to
him
as
soon
as
the
king
queen
and
princess
had
eaten
your
figs
great
horns
grew
on
their
heads
be
quiet
said
the
shepherd
i
have
a
remedy
here
and
can
soon
remove
the
horns
take
me
to
the
king
he
was
led
before
the
king
who
asked
him
what
kind
of
figs
he
had
sold
be
quiet
your
majesty
said
the
shepherd
and
eat
these
figs
at
the
same
time
giving
him
a
white
one
and
as
soon
as
the
king
had
eaten
it
one
of
the
horns
disappeared
now
said
the
shepherd
before
i
give
you
any
more
of
my
figs
you
must
give
me
back
my
whistle
if
not
you
may
keep
your
horn
the
king
in
his
terror
gave
up
the
whistle
and
the
shepherd
handed
the
queen
a
fig
when
one
of
the
queen
horns
had
disappeared
he
said
now
give
me
my
purse
back
or
else
i
will
take
my
figs
away
so
the
king
gave
him
his
purse
and
the
shepherd
removed
one
of
the
princess
horns
then
he
demanded
his
tablecloth
and
when
he
had
received
it
he
gave
the
king
another
fig
so
that
the
second
horn
disappeared
now
give
me
my
ring
he
said
and
the
king
had
to
give
him
his
ring
before
he
would
remove
the
queen
horn
the
only
one
left
now
was
the
princess
and
the
shepherd
said
now
fulfil
your
promise
and
marry
me
to
the
princess
otherwise
she
may
keep
her
horn
as
long
as
she
lives
so
the
princess
had
to
marry
him
and
after
the
wedding
he
gave
her
another
fig
to
eat
so
that
her
last
horn
also
disappeared
they
had
a
merry
wedding
and
when
the
old
king
died
the
shepherd
became
king
and
so
they
remained
contented
and
happy
and
were
like
a
bundle
of
roots
the
second
version
of
this
story
is
represented
by
but
three
examples
none
of
them
worth
giving
at
length
in
one
the
princess
wins
the
magic
objects
purse
cloak
that
renders
invisible
and
horn
that
blows
out
soldiers
at
play
the
loser
disguises
himself
as
a
priest
and
confesses
the
princess
when
she
is
ill
and
makes
her
give
back
the
objects
she
has
won
or
stolen
in
a
florentine
version
the
owner
of
the
objects
a
poor
shepherd
son
pretends
to
be
the
son
of
the
king
of
portugal
he
plays
with
the
princess
and
wins
but
his
true
origin
is
discovered
and
he
is
thrown
into
prison
there
he
makes
use
of
the
magic
tablecloth
which
he
sells
to
the
king
for
the
privilege
of
passing
a
night
in
the
princess
room
the
same
payment
is
asked
for
the
box
that
fills
itself
with
money
and
the
little
organ
that
makes
every
one
dance
the
shepherd
of
course
becomes
the
princess
husband
and
inherits
the
kingdom
when
the
king
dies
in
the
sicilian
story
pitrè
no
the
fairies
give
peter
the
purse
tablecloth
and
violin
and
he
goes
to
play
chess
with
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
spain
who
is
to
marry
whoever
beats
her
at
the
game
she
cheats
and
wins
and
peter
is
thrown
into
prison
there
he
uses
the
tablecloth
and
when
the
princess
hears
of
it
she
proposes
to
play
for
it
again
she
cheats
by
changing
a
chessman
while
peter
is
looking
away
and
the
loser
is
thrown
into
prison
again
they
play
again
for
the
magic
violin
and
peter
who
has
been
warned
in
prison
by
other
losers
of
the
princess
tricks
keeps
a
sharp
lookout
detects
and
defeats
her
they
are
married
and
peter
releases
all
the
defeated
players
from
jail
and
afterward
gets
rid
of
them
by
means
of
the
violin
the
third
version
is
the
most
popular
one
the
following
example
of
it
is
from
nerucci
collection
of
montalese
tales
no

for
we
are
your
relatives
the
steward
answered
why
not
you
should
have
come
sooner
and
i
would
have
helped
you
the
sooner
but
now
i
will
give
you
something
to
support
you
always
without
need
of
anything
more
i
will
give
you
this
little
ass
that
lays
money
you
have
only
to
put
a
cloth
under
him
and
he
will
fill
it
for
you
with
handsome
coins
but
take
care
do
tell
it
and
do
leave
this
animal
with
any
one
the
youth
departed
in
joy
and
after
he
had
travelled
a
long
way
he
stopped
at
an
inn
to
sleep
for
his
house
was
distant
he
said
to
the
landlord
give
me
a
lodging
but
look
my
ass
spends
the
night
with
me
what
said
the
landlord
what
are
you
thinking
about
it
can
not
be
the
youth
replied
yes
it
can
be
because
my
ass
does
not
leave
my
side
they
disputed
a
while
but
the
landlord
finally
consented
but
he
had
some
suspicions
and
when
the
boy
and
his
beast
were
shut
in
the
room
he
looked
through
the
and
saw
that
wonder
of
an
ass
that
laid
money
in
abundance
bless
me
cried
the
host
i
should
be
a
fool
indeed
if
i
let
this
piece
of
good
fortune
escape
my
hands
he
at
once
looked
for
another
ass
of
the
same
color
and
size
and
while
the
lad
was
asleep
exchanged
them
in
the
morning
the
boy
paid
his
bill
and
departed
but
on
the
way
the
ass
no
longer
laid
any
money
the
stupefied
child
did
not
know
what
to
think
at
first
but
afterward
examining
it
more
closely
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
ass
was
not
his
and
straightway
he
returned
to
the
innkeeper
to
complain
of
his
deception
the
landlord
cried
out
i
wonder
at
your
saying
such
a
thing
we
are
all
honest
people
here
and
do
steal
anything
from
anybody
go
away
blockhead
or
you
will
find
something
to
remember
a
while
the
child
weeping
had
to
depart
with
his
ass
and
he
went
back
to
his
uncle
farm
and
told
him
what
had
happened
the
uncle
said
if
you
had
not
stopped
at
the
innkeeper
you
could
not
have
met
with
this
misfortune
however
i
have
another
present
to
help
you
and
your
mother
but
take
care
do
not
mention
it
to
any
one
and
take
good
care
of
it
here
it
is
i
give
you
a
tablecloth
and
whenever
you
say
make
after
having
spread
it
out
you
will
see
a
fine
repast
at
your
pleasure
the
youth
took
the
tablecloth
in
delight
thanked
his
uncle
and
departed
but
like
the
fool
he
was
he
stopped
again
at
the
same
inn
he
said
to
the
landlord
give
me
a
room
and
you
need
not
prepare
anything
to
eat
i
have
all
i
want
with
me
the
crafty
innkeeper
suspected
that
there
was
something
beneath
this
and
when
the
lad
was
in
his
room
he
looked
through
the
and
saw
the
tablecloth
preparing
the
supper
the
host
exclaimed
what
good
luck
for
my
inn
i
will
not
let
it
escape
me
he
quickly
looked
for
another
tablecloth
like
this
one
with
the
same
embroidery
and
fringe
and
while
the
child
was
sleeping
he
exchanged
it
for
the
magic
one
so
that
in
the
morning
the
lad
did
not
perceive
the
knavery
not
until
he
had
reached
a
forest
where
he
was
hungry
did
he
want
to
make
use
of
the
tablecloth
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
spread
it
out
and
cried
make
the
tablecloth
was
not
the
same
one
and
made
nothing
ready
for
him
in
despair
the
boy
went
back
to
the
innkeeper
to
complain
and
the
landlord
would
have
thrashed
him
if
he
had
not
run
away
and
he
ran
until
he
reached
his
uncle
his
uncle
when
he
saw
him
in
such
a
plight
said
oh
what
is
the
matter
uncle
said
the
boy
the
same
innkeeper
has
changed
the
tablecloth
too
for
me
the
uncle
was
on
the
point
of
giving
the
dunce
a
good
thrashing
but
afterward
seeing
that
it
was
a
child
he
calmed
his
anger
and
said
i
understand
but
i
will
give
you
a
remedy
by
which
you
can
get
back
everything
from
that
thief
of
a
landlord
here
it
is
it
is
a
stick
hide
it
under
your
bolster
and
if
any
one
comes
to
rob
you
of
it
say
to
it
in
a
low
voice
beat
and
it
will
continue
to
do
so
until
you
say
to
it
imagine
how
joyfully
the
boy
took
the
stick
it
was
a
handsome
polished
stick
with
a
gold
handle
and
delighted
one
only
to
see
it
so
the
boy
thanked
his
uncle
for
his
kindness
and
after
he
had
journeyed
a
while
he
came
to
the
same
inn
he
said
landlord
i
wish
to
lodge
here
the
landlord
at
once
drew
his
conclusions
about
the
stick
which
the
boy
carried
openly
in
his
hands
and
at
night
when
the
lad
appeared
to
be
sound
asleep
but
really
was
on
the
watch
the
landlord
felt
softly
under
the
bolster
and
drew
out
the
stick
the
boy
although
it
was
dark
perceived
the
theft
and
said
in
a
low
voice
beat
beat
suddenly
blows
were
rained
down
without
mercy
everything
broken
to
pieces
the
chest
of
drawers
the
all
the
chairs
the
glass
in
the
windows
and
the
landlord
and
those
that
came
at
the
noise
beaten
nearly
to
death
the
landlord
screamed
to
split
his
throat
save
me
boy
i
am
dead
the
boy
answered
what
i
will
not
deliver
you
if
you
do
not
give
me
back
my
property
the
ass
that
lays
gold
and
the
tablecloth
that
prepares
dinner
and
if
the
landlord
did
not
want
to
die
of
the
blows
he
had
to
consent
to
the
boy
wishes
when
he
had
his
things
back
the
boy
went
home
to
his
mother
and
told
her
what
had
happened
to
him
and
then
said
now
we
do
not
need
anything
more
i
have
an
ass
that
lays
money
a
tablecloth
that
prepares
food
at
my
will
and
a
stick
to
defend
me
from
whoever
annoys
me
so
that
woman
and
her
son
who
from
want
had
become
rich
enough
to
cause
every
one
envy
wished
from
pride
to
invite
their
relatives
to
a
banquet
to
make
them
acquainted
with
their
wealth
on
the
appointed
day
the
relatives
came
to
the
woman
new
house
but
noon
strikes
one
strikes
it
is
almost
two
and
in
the
kitchen
the
fire
is
seen
extinguished
and
there
were
no
provisions
anywhere
are
they
playing
a
joke
on
us
said
the
relatives
we
shall
have
to
depart
with
dry
teeth
at
that
moment
however
the
clock
struck
two
and
the
lad
after
spreading
the
cloth
on
the
table
commanded
tablecloth
prepare
a
grand
banquet
in
short
those
people
had
a
fine
dinner
and
many
presents
in
money
and
the
boy
and
his
mother
remained
in
triumph
and
joy
the
next
story
to
which
we
shall
direct
our
attention
is
puss
in
boots
which
in
the
form
known
to
our
children
is
of
french
origin
being
one
of
the
tales
which
perrault
made
so
popular
by
his
versions
before
perrault
however
two
literary
versions
of
this
story
existed
one
in
straparola
and
one
in
the
pentamerone
there
are
besides
several
popular
versions
of
this
story
which
are
somewhat
peculiar
the
one
that
follows
is
from
sicily

went
to

and
heap
up

and
silver
when

the
king
gave
him
some
money
the
fox
kept
about
ten
paces
before

in
a

replied
softly

joseph
and
leave
it
to
me
they
went
on
and
on
and
the
fox
saw
another
farm
of
cattle
with
the
herdsman

thing
happened
there

wealth
gave
the
herdsman
a
piece
of
gold

pleased
on
the
one
hand
but
on
the
other
was
perplexed
and
did
not
know
how
it
was
to
turn
out
when
the
fox
turned
around
joseph
said
where
are
you
taking
me
fox

are
ruining
me
the
fox
kept
on
as
if
she
had
nothing
to

with
the
matter
then
she
came
to
another
farm
of
horses
and
mares
the
boy
who
was
tending
them
threw
a
stone
at
the

frightened
him
and
he
told
the
king
when
the
king
asked
him
that
the
farm
was

on
and

fox
told
his
wife
everything
so
he
took
an
earthen
jar
and
threw
it
at
the
fox
head
and
so
got
rid
of
her
thus
the
ungrateful
fellow
that
he
was
he
killed
the
one
who
had
done
him
so
much
kindness
but
nevertheless
he
enjoyed
all
his
wealth
with
his
wife
the
story
we
shall
next
consider
is
in
some
of
its
versions
legendary
in
its
nature
and
might
more
properly
perhaps
have
been
treated
in
chapter
iv
its
legendary
character
however
is
only
accidental
and
it
really
belongs
to
the
class
of
stories
discussed
in
the
present
chapter
the
story
in
general
maybe
termed
the
thankful
dead
from
the
most
important
episode
in
it
the
hero
shows
some
respect
to
a
corpse
paying
the
debts
it
incurred
when
alive
and
so
obtaining
the
right
of
burial
for
it
the
soul
of
which
becomes
the
hero
good
fairy
and
assists
him
when
in
danger
and
finally
brings
about
his
good
fortune
around
this
nucleus
have
gathered
various
episodes
which
will
be
mentioned
in
the
notes
as
an
example
of
this
story
we
give
on
account
of
its
rarity
the
istrian
version
ive
iii
xxxv
fair
brow
there
was
once
a
father
who
had
a
son
after
this
son
had
passed
through
school
his
father
said
to
him
son
now
that
you
have
finished
your
studies
you
are
of
an
age
to
travel
i
will
give
you
a
vessel
in
order
that
you
may
load
it
and
unload
it
buy
and
sell
be
careful
what
you
do
take
care
to
make
gains
he
gave
him
six
thousand
to
buy
merchandise
and
the
son
started
on
his
voyage
on
his
journey
without
having
yet
purchased
anything
he
arrived
at
a
town
and
on
the
he
saw
a
bier
and
noticed
that
those
who
passed
by
left
there
some
a
penny
some
two
they
bestowed
alms
on
the
corpse
the
traveller
went
there
and
asked
why
do
you
keep
this
dead
man
here
the
dead
desires
the
they
replied
because
he
owed
a
world
of
debts
and
it
is
the
custom
here
bury
no
one
until
his
debts
are
until
this
man
debts
are
paid
by
charity
we
can
not
bury
him
what
is
the
use
of
keeping
him
here
he
said
proclaim
that
all
those
whom
he
owed
shall
come
to
me
and
be
paid
then
they
issued
the
proclamation
and
he
paid
the
debts
and
poor
fellow
he
did
not
have
a
farthing
left
not
a
penny
of
his
capital
so
he
returned
to
his
father
house
what
news
son
what
means
your
return
so
soon
he
replied
on
crossing
the
sea
we
encountered
pirates
they
have
robbed
me
of
all
my
capital
his
father
said
no
matter
son
it
is
enough
that
they
have
left
you
your
life
behold
i
will
give
you
more
money
but
you
must
not
go
again
in
that
direction
he
gave
him
another
six
thousand
the
son
replied
yes
father
do
worry
i
will
change
my
course
he
departed
and
began
his
journey
when
he
was
well
out
at
sea
he
saw
a
turkish
vessel
he
said
to
himself
now
it
is
better
for
me
to
summon
them
on
board
than
for
them
to
summon
us
they
came
on
board
he
said
to
them
whence
do
you
come
they
answered
we
come
from
the
levant
what
is
your
cargo
nothing
but
a
beautiful
girl
how
do
you
come
to
have
this
girl
for
her
beauty
to
sell
her
again
we
have
stolen
her
from
the
sultan
she
is
so
beautiful
let
me
see
this
girl
when
he
saw
her
he
said
how
much
do
you
want
for
her
we
want
six
thousand
the
money
which
his
father
gave
him
he
gave
to
those
corsairs
and
took
the
girl
and
carried
her
away
to
his
ship
but
he
at
once
had
her
become
a
christian
and
married
her
he
returned
to
his
father
house
he
went
up
and
his
father
said
to
him
welcome
o
my
handsome
son
what
merchandise
of
women
have
you
made
my
father
i
bring
you
a
handsome
ring
i
bring
it
for
your
reward
it
cost
me
neither
city
nor
castle
but
the
most
beautiful
woman
you
have
ever
seen
the
daughter
of
the
sultan
who
is
in
turkey
her
i
bring
for
my
first
cargo
ah

miserable
knave
cried
his
father
is
this
the
cargo
you
have
brought
he
them
both
and
drove
them
from
the
house
those
poor
unfortunate
ones
did
not
know
where
to
find
shelter
they
went
away
and
at
a
short
distance
from
their
town
there
were
some
rooms
at
a
villa
they
went
to
live
in
one
of
those
he
said
what
shall
we
do
here
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
anything
i
have
no
profession
or
business
she
said
now
i
can
paint
beautiful
pictures
i
will
paint
them
and
you
shall
go
and
sell
them
he
said
very
well
but
remember
you
must
tell
no
one
that
i
paint
them
no
no
he
said
now
let
us
go
to
turkey
the
sultan
meanwhile
had
sent
out
many
vessels
in
search
of
his
daughter
these
ships
went
here
and
there
in
quest
of
her
now
it
happened
that
one
of
these
vessels
arrived
in
the
town
near
where
she
lived
and
many
of
the
sailors
went
on
land
now
one
day
the
husband
said
to
his
wife
make
many
pictures
for
we
shall
sell
them
she
made
them
and
said
to
him
that
he
should
not
sell
them
for
less
than
twenty
apiece
she
made
a
great
many
and
he
carried
them
to
the
public
square
some
of
the
turks
came
there
they
gave
a
glance
at
the
paintings
and
said
to
themselves
surely
it
must
be
the
sultan
daughter
who
has
painted
these
they
came
nearer
and
asked
the
young
man
how
he
sold
them
he
said
they
were
dear
that
he
could
not
let
them
go
for
less
than
twenty
they
said
very
well
we
will
buy
them
but
we
want
some
more
he
answered
come
to
the
house
of
my
wife
who
makes
them
they
went
there
and
when
they
saw
the
sultan
daughter
they
seized
her
bound
her
and
carried
her
far
away
to
turkey
this
husband
then
unhappy
without
wife
without
a
trade
alone
in
that
house
what
could
he
do
every
day
he
walked
along
the
beach
to
see
if
he
could
find
a
ship
that
would
take
him
on
board
but
he
never
saw
any
one
day
he
saw
an
old
man
fishing
in
a
little
boat
he
cried
good
old
man
how
much
better
off
you
are
than
i
the
old
man
asked
why
my
dear
son
he
said
good
old
man
will
you
take
me
to
fish
with
you
yes
my
son
said
he
if
you
wish
to
come
with
me
in
this
boat
i
will
take
you
thank
heaven
said
he
good
said
the
old
man
you
with
the
rod
and
i
with
the
boat
perhaps
we
shall
catch
some
fish
i
will
go
and
sell
the
fish
for
i
am
not
ashamed
and
we
will
live
together
they
ate
and
afterward
went
to
sleep
without
knowing
it
there
arose
in
the
night
a
severe
storm
and
the
wind
carried
them
to
turkey
the
turks
seeing
this
boat
arrive
went
on
board
seized
them
made
slaves
of
them
and
took
them
before
the
sultan
he
said
let
one
of
them
make
bouquets
let
the
other
plant
flowers
put
them
in
the
garden
they
placed
the
old
man
there
as
gardener
and
the
young
man
to
carry
flowers
to
the
sultan
daughter
who
with
her
maids
was
shut
up
in
a
very
high
tower
for
punishment
they
were
very
comfortable
there
every
day
they
went
into
the
garden
and
made
friends
with
the
other
gardeners
as
time
went
on
the
old
man
made
some
fine
guitars
violins
flutes
clarionets
piccolos
all
sorts
of
instruments
he
made
the
young
man
played
them
beautifully
when
he
had
time
one
day
his
wife
who
was
in
the
tower
hearing
his
fine
songs
fair
brow
had
a
voice
which
surpassed
all
instruments
said
who
is
playing
who
is
singing
so
beautifully
they
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
when
she
saw
fair
brow
she
thought
at
once
of
having
him
come
up
the
sultan
daughter
said
to
one
of
those
who
filled
the
basket
with
flowers
put
that
young
man
in
the
basket
and
cover
him
with
flowers
he
put
him
in
and
the
maids
drew
him
up
when
he
was
up
he
came
out
of
the
basket
and
beheld
his
wife
he
embraced
and
kissed
her
and
thought
about
escaping
from
there
then
she
told
her
damsels
that
she
wished
to
depart
without
any
one
knowing
it
so
they
loaded
a
large
ship
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
with
rods
of
gold
and
jewels
then
they
let
down
fair
brow
first
then
his
wife
finally
the
damsels
they
embarked
and
departed
when
they
were
out
at
sea
the
husband
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
the
old
man
and
left
him
on
shore
fair
brow
said
my
sister
even
if
i
thought
i
should
lose
my
life
i
would
turn
back
for
word
which
i
have
given
him
is
the
mother
of
so
they
turned
back
and
saw
the
old
man
who
was
still
awaiting
them
in
a
cave
they
took
him
with
them
and
put
to
sea
again
when
they
were
near
home
the
old
man
said
now
my
son
it
is
fitting
for
us
to
settle
our
accounts
and
divide
things
know
good
old
man
said
fair
brow
to
him
that
all
the
wealth
that
i
have
belongs
half
to
you
and
half
to
me
your
wife
too
belongs
half
to
me
he
said
good
old
man
i
will
leave
you
three
quarters
and
i
will
take
one
only
but
leave
me
my
wife
do
you
want
me
to
divide
her
in
two
then
the
old
man
said
you
must
know
that
i
am
the
soul
of
him
whom
you
had
buried
and
you
have
had
all
this
good
fortune
because
you
did
that
good
action
and
converted
and
baptized
your
wife
then
he
gave
him
his
blessing
and
disappeared
fair
brow
when
he
heard
this
as
you
can
imagine
came
near
dying
of
joy
when
they
reached
his
city
they
fired
a
salute
for
fair
brow
had
arrived
with
his
wife
the
wealthiest
gentleman
in
the
world
he
sent
for
his
father
and
told
him
all
that
had
happened
to
him
he
went
to
live
with
them
and
as
he
was
old
he
died
soon
and
all
his
riches
went
to
fair
brow
we
have
already
stated
in
the
preface
that
it
was
not
our
design
to
admit
into
this
work
except
for
occasional
reference
any
stories
that
were
literary
in
their
character
for
this
reason
we
have
not
drawn
on
the
treasures
of
straparola
or
basile
or
even
on
the
more
popular
of
which
there
are
in
italy
as
elsewhere
a
great
profusion
of
some
of
the
stories
contained
in
the
last
named
class
of
works
there
are
purely
popular
versions
as
an
example
of
the
class
and
for
purposes
of
comparison
we
give
the
story
of
leombruno
or
lionbruno
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
popular
of
its
kind
the
most
complete
version
is
the
one
from
the
basilicata
given
by
comparetti
no
which
is
as
follows
xxxvi
lionbruno
there
was
once
a
mariner
who
had
a
wife
and
three
or
four
children
he
followed
the
business
of
a
fisherman
and
he
and
his
family
lived
on
his
fishing
for
three
or
four
years
there
had
been
a
dearth
of
fish
so
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
catch
even
a
sardine
poor
mariner
from
this
misfortune
he
had
been
obliged
to
sell
little
by
little
all
he
possessed
to
live
and
was
reduced
almost
to
beggary
one
day
he
was
fishing
and
as
you
can
imagine
poor
fellow
he
did
not
haul
in
even
a
shell
he
cursed
madonnas
and
saints
all
at
once
a
certain
person
it
was
the
enemy
rose
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
before
his
bark
what
is
the
matter
mariner
that
you
are
so
angry
what
should
the
matter
be
my
bad
luck
for
three
or
four
years
i
have
been
ruining
myself
body
and
soul
in
this
sea
with
these
nets
and
i
can
not
catch
even
a
string
to
hang
myself
with
listen
said
the
enemy
if
you
will
agree
to
give
me
your
wife
next
child
in
thirteen
years
from
now
until
you
deliver
it
to
me
i
will
cause
you
to
catch
so
much
fish
that
you
shall
become
the
richest
of
men
by
selling
it
then
the
mariner
understood
that
this
was
the
enemy
and
said
to
himself
my
wife
has
had
no
children
for
some
years
will
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
have
another
just
now
when
i
make
this
agreement
with
the
enemy
oh
come
she
is
old
now
she
will
have
no
more
then
turning
to
the
enemy
he
said
well
since
you
wish
to
make
this
contract
let
us
make
it
but
remember
you
must
make
me
rich
do
fear
said
the
enemy
let
us
make
the
agreement
and
then
leave
the
matter
to
me
softly
we
must
settle
another
matter
first
then
we
will
make
the
contract
what
is
it
listen
suppose
my
wife
should
have
no
children
during
these
thirteen
years
then
you
will
remain
rich
and
give
me
nothing
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know
now
we
can
make
the
contract
and
they
settled
everything
at
once
then
the
enemy
disappeared
the
mariner
began
to
draw
in
his
nets
and
they
were
full
to
overflowing
of
all
kinds
of
fish
and
he
became
richer
from
day
to
day
in
great
joy
he
said
i
have
played
a
trick
on
the
devil
and
poor
man
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
devil
who
had
played
a
trick
on
him
now
you
must
know
that
just
when
they
were
making
the
contract
the
mariner
wife
old
as
she
was
expected
to
become
a
mother
again
and
the
enemy
knew
it
in
due
time
the
wife
gave
birth
to
a
boy
so
handsome
that
he
seemed
a
flower
his
parents
named
him
lionbruno
the
enemy
suddenly
appeared
mariner
mariner
how
can
i
serve
you
replied
the
poor
man
all
trembling
the
promise
is
due
lionbruno
is
mine
yes
you
are
right
but
you
must
obey
the
contract
remember
that
it
is
in
thirteen
years
now
only
a
few
months
have
passed
that
is
true
replied
the
enemy
farewell
then
until
the
end
of
the
thirteen
years
then
he
vanished
meanwhile
lionbruno
grew
every
day
and
became
constantly
handsomer
and
his
parents
sent
him
to
school
but
time
passes
and
behold
the
end
of
the
thirteen
years
draws
near
one
day
before
the
time
agreed
upon
the
enemy
appeared
mariner
mariner
oh
poor
me
said
the
wretched
man
who
recognized
him
by
his
horrid
voice
but
he
had
to
answer
and
what
could
he
do
the
contract
was
clear
and
the
time
come
the
poor
mariner
willingly
or
unwillingly
was
obliged
to
promise
to
send
the
boy
the
next
day
alone
to
the
sea
the
next
day
the
mother
sent
her
son
when
he
returned
from
school
to
carry
something
to
eat
to
his
father
the
unhappy
father
had
however
gone
far
out
to
sea
so
that
his
son
could
not
find
him
the
poor
boy
sat
down
on
the
beach
and
to
pass
the
time
took
pieces
of
wood
and
made
little
crosses
of
them
and
stuck
them
in
the
sand
around
him
so
that
he
was
surrounded
by
them
and
held
one
also
in
his
hand
singing
all
the
time
behold
the
enemy
comes
to
take
him
and
says
to
him
what
are
you
doing
boy
i
am
waiting
for
my
father
he
replied
the
enemy
looked
and
saw
that
he
could
not
take
him
because
he
was
seated
in
the
midst
of
all
those
little
crosses
and
moreover
had
one
in
his
hand
he
regarded
the
boy
with
an
ugly
look
and
cried
destroy
those
crosses
miserable
boy
no
i
will
not
destroy
them
destroy
them
at
once
or
or
and
he
threatened
him
and
frightened
him
with
his
ugly
face
then
the
poor
child
destroyed
the
little
crosses
around
him
but
still
held
one
in
his
hand
destroy
the
other
quick
cried
the
enemy
more
enraged
than
ever
no
no
the
poor
child
replied
all
in
tears
i
will
not
destroy
this
little
cross
the
enemy
threatened
him
again
and
terrified
him
with
his
rolling
eyes
but
the
child
was
firm
and
then
a
bright
light
appeared
in
the
air
the
fairy
colina
queen
of
the
fairies
came
down
took
the
good
boy
by
the
hair
and
delivered
him
from
the
enemy
then
if
you
had
seen
what
lightnings
and
thunder
what
darts
the
enemy
shot
fire
from
his
eyes
mouth
nose
ears
everywhere
but
with
all
his
flames
he
remained
duped
and
the
fairy
carried
the
good
boy
away
to
her
splendid
palace
there
lionbruno
grew
up
in
the
midst
of
the
fairies
imagine
how
well
off
he
was
there
he
lacked
nothing
increasing
always
in
beauty
he
became
a
youth
whom
you
should
have
seen
some
years
passed
one
day
lionbruno
said
to
the
fairy
colina
listen
i
want
to
go
and
see
my
mother
and
father
a
little
you
will
not
refuse
me
your
permission
will
you
no
i
will
not
refuse
you
it
said
the
fairy
i
will
give
you
twenty
days
to
go
and
see
your
family
but
do
not
stay
any
longer
remember
that
i
have
saved
you
from
the
enemy
and
have
brought
you
up
in
the
midst
of
great
wealth
now
this
wealth
we
are
to
enjoy
together
for
you
lionbruno
are
to
be
my
husband
you
can
imagine
whether
the
youth
wished
to
say
no
he
replied
at
once
i
will
do
your
will
in
all
things
then
the
fairy
said
my
lionbruno
take
this
ruby
all
that
you
ask
of
it
you
shall
have
he
took
the
ruby
then
all
the
fairies
gave
him
in
turn
some
token
he
took
them
and
thanked
them
all
then
he
embraced
his
bride
and
departed
lionbruno
travelled
better
than
a
prince
magnificently
dressed
on
a
superb
horse
with
guards
before
him
he
arrived
at
his
town
went
to
the
square
and
a
crowd
of
people
surrounded
him
out
of
curiosity
he
asked
his
way
to
the
house
of
the
mariner
who
was
his
father
he
did
not
reveal
himself
to
his
parents
but
asked
them
for
a
lodging
that
night
at
midnight
lionbruno
changed
by
virtue
of
the
ruby
the
wretched
hovel
into
a
magnificent
palace
and
the
next
day
he
changed
himself
into
the
lionbruno
and
revealed
himself
to
his
parents
telling
them
how
the
fairy
colina
had
liberated
him
from
the
enemy
brought
him
up
and
made
him
her
husband
for
this
reason
dear
father
and
mother
said
he
i
can
not
remain
with
you
i
have
come
to
see
you
to
embrace
you
to
make
you
rich
but
i
can
stay
with
you
a
few
days
only
and
then
i
must
leave
you
his
father
and
mother
saw
that
they
could
do
nothing
and
had
to
be
contented
one
fine
morning
lionbruno
by
an
order
to
the
ruby
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
brought
together
a
great
mass
of
riches
and
then
called
his
parents
and
said
i
leave
you
masters
of
all
this
wealth
and
of
this
palace
you
will
no
longer
need
anything
now
give
me
your
blessing
for
i
wish
to
go
the
poor
people
began
to
weep
and
said
bless
you
my
son
they
embraced
each
other
in
tears
and
he
departed
he
arrived
at
a
great
city
like
naples
for
example
and
went
to
lodge
at
the
finest
inn
then
he
went
out
to
walk
and
heard
a
proclamation
which
declared
whatever
prince
or
knight
on
horse
with
spear
in
hand
shall
pierce
and
carry
away
a
gold
star
shall
marry
the
king
daughter
imagine
how
many
princes
and
knights
entered
the
lists
lionbruno
more
for
braggadocio
than
for
anything
else
said
to
himself
i
wish
to
go
and
carry
away
the
star
and
he
commanded
the
ruby
my
ruby
i
wish
to
carry
away
the
golden
star
the
princes
and
knights
began
to
assemble
and
try
their
skill
every
one
reached
the
star
and
touched
it
with
his
spear
but
there
was
no
talk
of
their
carrying
it
away
lionbruno
came
and
with
a
carried
off
the
star
then
he
quickly
escaped
with
his
horse
to
the
inn
so
that
no
one
should
see
him
who
is
he
where
is
the
winner
no
one
can
give
any
news
of
him
the
king
was
about
it
and
issued
the
proclamation
again
for
the
next
day
but
to
cut
the
matter
short
the
same
thing
occurred
the
next
day
lionbruno
duped
them
a
second
time
imagine
how
angry
the
king
was
he
issued
a
third
proclamation
but
this
time
what
does
the
crafty
king
do
he
posts
a
large
number
of
soldiers
at
all
the
places
by
which
one
could
escape
the
princes
and
knights
begin
their
courses
as
usual
no
one
carries
away
the
star
and
lionbruno
carries
it
off
and
rides
away
but
the
soldiers
quicker
than
he
seize
him
arrest
him
and
carry
him
to
the
king
what
do
you
take
me
for
that
not
satisfied
with
duping
me
twice
you
wish
to
dupe
me
a
third
time
thus
spoke
the
king
who
was
seated
on
the
throne
pardon
majesty
i
did
not
dare
to
enter
your
presence
then
you
ought
not
to
have
undertaken
to
carry
away
the
star
now
you
have
done
so
and
must
become
my
daughter
husband
lionbruno
was
obliged
to
marry
the
princess
the
king
prepared
a
magnificent
feast
for
the
wedding
and
invited
all
the
princes
counts
and
barons
all
sorts
of
persons
when
the
hall
was
filled
with
these
gentlemen
lionbruno
before
marrying
the
princess
said
to
the
king
majesty
it
is
true
that
your
daughter
is
a
very
beautiful
girl
but
i
had
a
bride
by
whose
side
your
daughter
could
not
stand
for
beauty
grace
everything
imagine
how
the
king
felt
when
he
heard
these
words
the
poor
princess
at
this
affront
in
the
presence
of
so
many
noblemen
became
as
red
as
fire
the
king
greatly
disturbed
said
well
if
it
is
so
we
wish
to
see
your
wife
if
she
is
as
beautiful
as
you
say
yes
yes
cried
all
the
noblemen
we
too
wish
to
see
her
we
wish
to
see
her
poor
lionbruno
was
in
a
tight
place
what
could
he
do
he
had
recourse
to
the
ruby
ruby
mine
make
fairy
colina
come
here
but
this
time
he
was
mistaken
the
ruby
could
do
everything
but
it
could
not
compel
the
fairy
to
come
for
it
was
she
who
had
given
it
its
magic
power
the
summons
however
reached
the
fairy
colina
but
she
did
not
go
my
friend
has
done
a
pretty
thing
said
she
bravo
good
now
i
will
fix
him
as
he
deserves
she
called
the
lowest
of
her
servants
and
made
her
suddenly
appear
in
the
great
hall
of
the
king
where
all
were
assembled
for
the
wedding
how
beautiful
she
is
how
beautiful
she
is
all
said
as
soon
as
they
saw
her
is
this
then
your
first
bride
what
answered
lionbruno
my
first
bride
this
is
the
lowest
of
the
servants
of
my
first
bride
gracious
exclaimed
the
noblemen
if
this
is
the
lowest
of
the
servants
and
is
so
beautiful
imagine
what
the
mistress
must
be
then
said
the
king
if
this
is
not
your
first
bride
i
wish
you
to
make
her
come
herself
yes
yes
herself
cried
the
others
likewise
poor
lionbruno
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
ring
but
this
time
also
the
fairy
did
not
go
but
sent
instead
her
next
servant
scarcely
had
they
seen
her
when
they
all
said
this
one
oh
this
one
is
really
beautiful
this
now
is
certainly
your
first
bride
is
she
not
lionbruno
no
no
replied
lionbruno
my
first
bride
is
a
marvel
of
beauty
different
from
this
one
this
one
is
only
the
second
servant
then
the
king
in
a
threatening
tone
said
to
him
lionbruno
let
us
put
an
end
to
this
i
command
you
to
cause
your
first
wife
to
come
here
instantly
the
matter
was
growing
serious
poor
lionbruno
had
recourse
for
the
third
time
to
the
ruby
and
said
to
it
ruby
mine
if
you
really
wish
to
help
me
now
is
the
moment
you
must
cause
the
fairy
colina
herself
to
come
here
the
summons
reached
her
at
once
and
this
time
she
went
when
all
those
great
lords
and
the
king
and
his
daughter
saw
that
marvel
of
beauty
they
became
as
so
many
statues
but
the
fairy
colina
approached
lionbruno
pretended
to
take
his
hand
and
drew
off
his
ring
saying
traitor
you
can
not
find
me
until
you
have
worn
out
seven
pairs
of
iron
shoes
then
she
vanished
the
king
in
fury
said
to
lionbruno
i
understand
the
power
of
carrying
off
the
star
was
not
yours
but
your
ruby
leave
my
palace
he
had
him
seized
and
well
beaten
and
sent
away
and
so
poor
lionbruno
was
left
without
the
fairy
colina
and
the
daughter
and
departed
from
the
city
in
great
grief
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
he
heard
a
great
noise
it
was
a
smithy
he
entered
and
called
the
blacksmith
master
i
want
seven
pairs
of
iron
shoes
i
will
make
you
twelve
if
you
wish
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
have
some
agreement
with
the
eternal
to
live
who
knows
how
many
hundred
years
to
wear
out
all
these
shoes
what
does
that
matter
to
you
it
is
enough
if
i
pay
you
make
me
the
shoes
and
hold
your
tongue
he
made
them
for
him
at
once
lionbruno
paid
him
put
on
one
pair
and
stuck
three
in
one
side
of
his
travelling
sack
and
three
in
the
other
and
set
out
after
walking
a
long
time
he
arrived
late
at
night
in
a
forest
all
at
once
three
robbers
came
there
good
man
said
they
to
lionbruno
how
did
you
happen
here
i
am
a
poor
pilgrim
he
replied
it
grew
dark
and
i
stopped
here
to
rest
and
who
are
you
gentlemen
we
are
travellers
and
they
all
stopped
there
to
rest
the
next
day
lionbruno
arose
took
leave
of
the
three
robbers
and
departed
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
a
few
steps
when
he
heard
them
quarrelling
now
you
must
know
that
those
robbers
had
stolen
three
objects
of
great
value
and
were
now
disputing
as
to
how
they
should
divide
them
one
of
them
said
fools
that
we
are
we
had
here
that
pilgrim
who
could
have
acted
as
judge
and
made
the
division
and
we
have
let
him
go
let
us
call
him
back
yes
yes
let
us
call
him
said
the
others
they
called
him
and
he
came
back
how
can
i
serve
you
gentlemen
said
he
listen
good
man
we
have
three
objects
of
great
value
to
divide
you
must
be
the
judge
and
give
to
each
one
what
belongs
to
him
very
well
but
what
objects
are
you
talking
of
here
is
a
pair
of
boots
a
purse
and
a
cloak
the
boots
have
this
virtue
that
he
who
has
them
on
runs
faster
than
the
wind
if
you
say
to
the
purse
and
shut
it
at
once
gives
you
a
hundred
ducats
finally
he
who
puts
on
the
cloak
and
buttons
it
up
can
see
and
yet
not
be
seen
very
good
but
to
act
the
judge
well
i
must
first
examine
these
three
objects
carefully
certainly
that
is
right
lionbruno
put
on
the
boots
tried
to
run
and
went
marvellously
what
do
you
think
of
these
boots
asked
the
thieves
excellent
indeed
replied
lionbruno
and
kept
them
on
then
he
said
now
let
us
see
the
purse
he
took
it
and
said
purse
open
and
shut
and
at
once
there
came
forth
a
hundred
silver
ducats
now
let
us
see
what
this
cloak
is
he
said
at
last
he
put
it
on
and
began
to
button
it
up
while
he
was
doing
so
he
asked
the
robbers
do
you
see
me
now
they
answered
yes
he
kept
on
buttoning
it
and
asked
again
now
do
you
see
me
yes
finally
he
reached
the
last
button
now
do
you
see
me
no
if
you
do
see
me
now
you
never
will
see
me
again
he
threw
away
the
iron
shoes
and
cried
now
for
you
boots
and
away
faster
than
the
wind
when
the
three
robbers
saw
themselves
duped
in
that
way
what
a
rage
they
were
in
they
thrashed
each
other
soundly
and
especially
the
one
who
had
called
lionbruno
back
and
at
last
they
all
found
themselves
with
broken
bones
lionbruno
after
having
cheated
the
robbers
thus
continued
his
way
joyfully
after
a
long
journey
he
arrived
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
he
saw
at
a
distance
a
slight
smoke
and
among
frightful
rocks
a
little
old
hovel
all
surrounded
by
dense
wild
shrubs
with
a
little
door
entirely
covered
with
ivy
so
that
it
could
scarcely
be
seen
lionbruno
approached
the
door
and
knocked
softly
who
is
knocking
asked
from
within
an
old
woman
voice
i
am
a
poor
christian
replied
lionbruno
night
has
overtaken
me
here
and
i
am
seeking
a
lodging
if
it
can
be
had
the
door
opened
and
lionbruno
entered
oh
poor
youth
how
have
you
been
tempted
to
come
and
ruin
yourself
in
this
remote
place
demanded
in
great
wonder
the
old
woman
who
was
within
and
who
was
borea
do
you
know
who
borea
is
no
less
a
person
than
the
mother
of
the
winds
oh
dear
little
old
lady
my
aunt
replied
lionbruno
i
am
lost
in
this
great
forest
for
i
have
been
travelling
a
long
time
to
find
my
dear
bride
the
fairy
colina
and
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
any
trace
of
her
my
son
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
what
shall
we
do
now
that
my
sons
are
coming
home
perhaps
god
help
you
they
will
want
to
eat
you
oh
wretched
me
cried
lionbruno
then
all
trembling
who
my
aunt
are
these
sons
of
yours
who
so
devour
christians
my
son
replied
borea
you
do
not
know
where
you
are
do
you
not
know
that
this
house
in
the
midst
of
these
precipices
is
the
house
of
the
winds
and
i
you
do
not
recognize
me
i
my
son
am
borea
the
mother
of
all
the
winds
what
shall
i
do
now
oh
my
dear
aunt
help
me
do
not
let
your
sons
eat
me
up
the
old
woman
finally
concealed
him
in
a
chest
telling
him
not
to
make
the
slightest
noise
when
her
sons
returned
soon
a
loud
noise
was
heard
at
a
distance
it
was
the
winds
returning
home
the
nearer
they
approached
the
louder
the
noise
grew
and
a
sound
of
branches
and
trees
broken
off
was
heard
at
last
the
winds
arrived
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
good
evening
mamma
welcome
my
sons
replied
their
mother
all
smiling
and
so
one
after
the
other
all
the
winds
entered
and
the
last
to
enter
was
sirocco
for
you
must
know
that
sirocco
is
the
youngest
of
sons
scarcely
had
they
entered
when
they
began
to
say
what
smell
of
human
flesh
is
here
here
christians
christians
oh
bad
luck
to
you
what
fools
you
are
where
is
there
any
smell
of
human
flesh
here
who
do
you
think
would
risk
their
lives
by
coming
here
but
her
sons
would
not
be
convinced
especially
that
obstinate
sirocco
lionbruno
commended
his
soul
to
god
for
he
saw
death
at
his
heels
but
finally
borea
succeeded
in
convincing
her
sons
oh
mamma
what
is
there
to
eat
we
have
travelled
so
far
and
are
so
hungry
here
my
sons
the
mother
answered
come
here
for
a
nice
polenta
is
cooking
for
you
i
will
finish
cooking
it
soon
and
put
it
at
once
on
the
table
the
next
day
borea
said
to
her
sons
my
sons
when
you
came
you
said
you
smelled
human
flesh
tell
me
should
you
really
see
a
man
now
what
would
you
do
to
him
now
we
would
not
do
anything
to
him
last
night
we
should
have
torn
him
in
pieces
but
you
would
not
do
anything
to
him
truly
truly
well
if
you
will
give
me
your
promise
by
john
not
to
harm
him
i
will
show
you
a
live
man
oh
just
see
a
man
here
yes
yes
mamma
show
him
to
us
at
once
we
swear
by
john
we
will
not
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
then
their
mother
opened
the
chest
and
made
lionbruno
come
forth
if
you
had
heard
the
winds
then
they
puffed
and
blowed
around
him
and
asked
him
first
of
all
how
he
had
come
to
that
place
where
no
living
soul
had
ever
penetrated
lionbruno
said
would
to
heaven
that
my
journey
ended
here
i
must
go
to
the
palace
of
the
fairy
colina
perhaps
one
of
you
can
tell
me
where
it
is
then
borea
asked
her
sons
one
by
one
and
each
replied
that
he
knew
nothing
of
it
finally
she
questioned
her
youngest
son
and
you
sirocco
do
you
not
know
anything
about
it
i
should
i
not
know
something
about
it
am
i
perchance
like
my
brothers
who
never
can
find
a
the
fairy
colina
is
she
says
that
her
lover
has
betrayed
her
and
continually
weeps
and
is
so
reduced
by
her
grief
that
she
can
live
but
little
longer
and
i
deserve
to
be
hanged
for
i
have
seen
her
in
this
condition
and
yet
i
have
annoyed
her
so
that
i
have
driven
her
to
despair
i
amused
myself
by
making
a
noise
about
her
palace
and
more
than
once
i
burst
open
windows
and
turned
things
upside
down
even
the
bed
she
was
resting
on
oh
my
dear
sirocco
said
lionbruno
my
good
sirocco
you
must
aid
me
since
you
have
given
me
news
of
her
you
must
also
do
me
the
favor
to
show
me
the
way
to
my
bride
palace
i
dear
sirocco
am
the
betrothed
of
the
fairy
colina
and
it
is
not
true
that
i
have
betrayed
her
on
the
contrary
if
i
do
not
find
her
i
shall
die
of
grief
my
son
said
sirocco
listen
for
my
part
i
would
take
you
there
with
all
my
heart
but
i
should
have
to
carry
you
about
my
neck
and
the
trouble
is
i
can
not
do
so
for
i
am
wind
i
am
air
and
you
would
slip
off
were
you
like
me
the
matter
would
go
very
well
worry
about
that
said
lionbruno
show
me
the
way
and
i
will
not
lag
behind
he
is
crazy
said
sirocco
to
himself
then
he
said
to
lionbruno
very
well
since
you
feel
so
strong
we
will
make
the
trial
meanwhile
let
us
go
to
bed
for
it
is
late
and
god
willing
we
will
rise
early
and
all
went
to
sleep
in
the
morning
early
sirocco
arose
and
cried
lionbruno
lionbruno
get
up
quickly
and
lionbruno
put
on
his
boots
in
a
hurry
seized
his
purse
fixed
his
cloak
carefully
and
left
the
house
with
sirocco
there
said
sirocco
is
the
way
we
must
take
be
careful
do
let
me
out
of
your
sight
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
if
a
few
hours
after
sunset
i
make
you
find
your
beauty
you
may
call
me
an
ass
they
started
they
ran
like
the
wind
every
little
while
sirocco
called
out
lionbruno
and
he
who
was
ahead
answered
at
once
oh
do
think
i
am
going
to
lag
behind
and
with
these
questions
and
answers
they
finally
reached
the
palace
of
the
fairy
colina
about
two
hours
after
sunset
here
we
are
said
sirocco
here
is
your
fair
one
balcony
see
how
i
am
going
to
blow
open
the
window
for
you
attention
now
as
soon
as
it
is
opened
you
give
a
jump
and
spring
in
and
so
he
did
before
the
servants
could
run
and
shut
the
balcony
window
lionbruno
was
already
under
the
fairy
colina
bed
afterwards
one
of
the
maids
said
to
the
fairy
my
mistress
how
do
you
feel
now
do
you
not
feel
a
little
better
better
i
am
half
dead
that
cursed
wind
has
nearly
killed
me
but
mistress
will
you
not
take
something
this
evening
a
little
coffee
or
chocolate
or
broth
i
wish
nothing
at
all
take
something
if
you
do
you
will
not
rest
you
have
eaten
nothing
for
three
or
four
days
really
you
must
take
something
and
the
servant
said
so
much
that
to
get
rid
of
her
importunity
the
fairy
said
well
bring
something
if
i
want
it
i
will
take
it
the
servant
brought
a
little
coffee
and
left
it
by
the
side
of
the
bed
lionbruno
in
his
cloak
so
that
no
one
could
see
him
came
from
under
the
bed
and
drank
the
coffee
himself
the
servant
believing
her
mistress
had
drunk
it
brought
the
chocolate
too
and
lionbruno
drank
that
as
before
then
the
servant
brought
the
fairy
some
broth
and
a
pigeon
mistress
said
she
since
thank
god
you
have
taken
the
coffee
and
the
chocolate
take
this
broth
and
a
bit
of
pigeon
and
so
you
will
gain
strength
and
be
better
the
mistress
on
hearing
all
this
believed
that
the
servants
were
making
fun
of
her
oh
stupid
blockheads
what
are
you
saying
are
not
the
cups
still
here
with
the
coffee
and
the
chocolate
i
have
touched
nothing
the
servants
thought
that
their
mistress
was
out
of
her
mind
then
lionbruno
took
off
his
cloak
came
out
from
under
the
bed
and
said
my
bride
do
you
know
me
lionbruno
mine
is
it
you
and
she
rose
from
the
bed
and
embraced
him
then
it
is
not
true
my
lionbruno
that
you
have
forgotten
me
if
i
had
forgotten
you
i
should
not
have
suffered
so
much
to
find
you
but
do
you
still
love
me
my
lionbruno
if
i
had
not
always
loved
you
you
would
not
have
found
me
at
the
point
of
death
and
now
you
see
i
am
cured
only
because
i
have
seen
you
then
they
ate
and
drank
together
and
summoned
the
servants
and
made
a
great
festival
the
next
day
they
arranged
everything
for
the
wedding
and
were
married
with
great
splendor
and
joy
in
the
evening
they
gave
a
grand
ball
and
a
fine
banquet
which
you
should
have
seen
the
above
story
is
extremely
popular
and
has
long
circulated
among
the
people
as
an
independent
work
in
the
shape
of
a
we
have
however
given
the
form
which
is
handed
down
by
oral
tradition
purposely
avoiding
the
use
of
any
literary
materials
many
similar
tales
might
be
added
to
this
chapter
but
the
most
important
and
best
known
have
been
given
to
give
those
tales
which
can
not
be
described
as
fairy
tales
and
which
are
usually
found
in
the
shape
of
in
prose
and
poetry
would
fall
without
the
scope
of
the
present
volume
and
would
belong
more
appropriately
to
a
work
on
italian
popular
literature
chapter
iii
stories
of
oriental
origin
the
geographical
situation
of
italy
and
its
commercial
connections
during
the
middle
ages
would
lead
us
to
expect
a
large
foreign
element
in
its
popular
tales
this
foreign
element
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
is
almost
exclusively
oriental
and
was
introduced
either
by
direct
communication
with
the
east
or
indirectly
from
france
which
received
it
from
spain
whither
it
was
brought
by
the
saracens
although
this
oriental
element
is
now
perfectly
popular
it
is
as
far
as
its
origin
is
concerned
purely
literary
that
is
to
say
the
stories
we
are
about
to
examine
are
to
be
found
in
the
great
oriental
collections
of
tales
which
were
early
translated
into
all
the
languages
of
europe
and
either
passed
directly
from
these
translations
into
circulation
among
the
people
or
became
familiar
to
them
from
the
novelists
who
made
such
frequent
use
of
this
element
a
few
stories
may
have
been
taken
from
the
french
or
from
the
french
translations
of
the
as
we
shall
afterwards
see
the
pentamerone
and
especially
straparola
tales
may
finally
be
mentioned
as
the
source
from
which
many
oriental
stories
have
flowed
into
popular
circulation
in
this
chapter
it
is
proposed
to
notice
briefly
only
those
stories
the
oriental
origin
of
which
is
undoubted
and
which
may
be
found
in
the
great
collections
above
mentioned
and
in
some
others
less
known
for
convenience
some
stories
of
this
class
have
been
referred
to
chapter
vi
the
first
of
this
class
which
we
shall
mention
is
well
known
from
the
version
in
lafontaine
ix
dépositaire
the
only
italian
version
we
have
found
is
pitrè
no
which
is
as
follows
xxxvii
the
peasant
and
the
master
a
peasant
one
day
conversing
in
the
farmhouse
with
his
master
and
others
happened
while
speaking
of
sheep
and
cheese
to
say
that
he
had
had
a
present
of
a
little
cheese
but
the
mice
had
eaten
it
all
up
then
the
master
who
was
rich
proud
and
fat
called
him
a
fool
and
said
that
it
was
not
possible
that
the
mice
could
have
eaten
the
cheese
and
all
present
said
the
master
was
right
and
the
peasant
wrong
what
more
could
the
poor
man
say
talk
makes
talk
after
a
while
the
master
said
that
having
taken
the
precaution
to
rub
with
oil
his
ploughshares
to
keep
them
from
rusting
the
mice
had
eaten
off
all
the
points
then
the
friend
of
the
cheese
broke
forth
but
master
how
can
it
be
that
the
mice
can
not
eat
my
cheese
if
they
can
eat
the
points
of
your
ploughshares
but
the
master
and
all
the
others
began
to
cry
out
be
silent
you
fool
be
silent
you
fool
the
master
is
right
the
above
story
really
belongs
to
the
class
of
fables
of
which
there
are
but
few
of
oriental
origin
in
the
italian
collections
the
following
version
of
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
eastern
apologues
is
from
monferrato
comparetti
no
it
is
called
xxxviii
the
ingrates
there
was
once
a
man
who
went
into
the
forest
to
gather
wood
and
saw
a
snake
crushed
under
a
large
stone
he
raised
the
stone
a
little
with
the
handle
of
his
axe
and
the
snake
crawled
out
when
it
was
at
liberty
it
said
to
the
man
i
am
going
to
eat
you
the
man
answered
softly
first
let
us
hear
the
judgment
of
some
one
and
if
i
am
condemned
then
you
shall
eat
me
the
first
one
they
met
was
a
horse
as
thin
as
a
stick
tied
to
an
he
had
eaten
the
leaves
as
far
as
he
could
reach
for
he
was
famished
the
snake
said
to
him
is
it
right
for
me
to
eat
this
man
who
has
saved
my
life
the
nag
answered
more
than
right
just
look
at
me
i
was
one
of
the
finest
horses
i
have
carried
my
master
so
many
years
and
what
have
i
gained
now
that
i
am
so
badly
off
that
i
can
no
longer
work
they
have
tied
me
to
this
oak
and
after
i
have
eaten
these
few
leaves
i
shall
die
of
hunger
eat
the
man
then
for
he
who
does
good
is
ill
rewarded
and
he
who
does
evil
must
be
well
rewarded
eat
him
for
you
will
be
doing
a
good
day
work
they
afterwards
happened
to
find
a
all
holes
for
it
was
eaten
by
old
age
and
the
snake
asked
it
if
it
was
right
to
eat
the
man
who
had
saved
its
life
yes
the
tree
answered
at
once
for
i
have
given
my
master
so
many
leaves
that
he
has
raised
from
them
the
finest
in
the
world
now
that
i
can
no
longer
stand
upright
he
has
said
that
he
is
going
to
throw
me
into
the
fire
eat
him
then
for
you
will
do
well
afterwards
they
met
the
fox
the
man
took
her
aside
and
begged
her
to
pronounce
in
his
favor
the
fox
said
the
better
to
render
judgment
i
must
see
just
how
the
matter
has
happened
they
all
returned
to
the
spot
and
arranged
matters
as
they
were
at
first
but
as
soon
as
the
man
saw
the
snake
under
the
stone
he
cried
out
where
you
are
there
i
will
leave
you
and
there
the
snake
remained
the
fox
wished
in
payment
a
bag
of
hens
and
the
man
promised
them
to
her
for
the
next
morning
the
fox
went
there
in
the
morning
and
when
the
man
saw
her
he
put
some
dogs
in
the
bag
and
told
the
fox
not
to
eat
the
hens
close
by
for
fear
the
mistress
of
the
house
would
hear
it
so
the
fox
did
not
open
the
bag
until
she
had
reached
a
distant
valley
then
the
dogs
came
out
and
ate
her
and
so
it
is
in
the
world
for
who
does
good
is
ill
rewarded
and
who
does
evil
is
well
rewarded
it
would
be
surprising
if
we
did
not
find
the
fascinating
stories
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
naturalized
among
the
people
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
tell
whether
they
were
communicated
to
the
people
directly
from
a
literary
source
or
whether
the
separate
stories
came
to
italy
from
the
orient
by
way
of
oral
transmission
these
stories
have
circulated
among
the
people
long
enough
to
be
treated
as
their
own
property
and
changed
to
suit
their
taste
incidents
from
other
stories
have
been
added
and
the
original
story
remodelled
until
it
is
hardly
recognizable
the
story
of
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
for
instance
is
found
from
sicily
to
lombardy
but
in
no
one
version
are
all
the
features
of
the
original
story
preserved
in
one
of
the
sicilian
versions
messina
aladdin
does
not
lose
his
lamp
in
another
palermo
after
aladdin
has
lost
his
lamp
he
goes
in
search
of
it
and
on
his
journey
settles
the
quarrel
of
an
ant
an
eagle
and
a
lion
who
give
him
the
power
to
transform
himself
into
any
one
of
them
he
finally
discovers
the
magician
who
has
his
life
elsewhere
than
in
his
own
body
and
who
is
killed
after
the
usual
complicated
process
in
the
roman
version
the
point
of
the
unfinished
window
in
aladdin
palace
is
missed
the
magician
requires
to
be
killed
as
in
the
version
from
palermo
and
there
are
some
additional
incidents
not
in
the
oriental
original
in
the
mantuan
story
instead
of
a
lamp
we
have
a
rusty
ring
which
the
youngest
brother
finds
inside
of
a
dead
cock
bequeathed
to
three
brothers
by
their
father
after
the
ring
has
fallen
into
the
possession
of
the
magician
and
the
palace
has
disappeared
the
hero
goes
in
search
of
his
wife
and
ring
on
his
way
he
is
assisted
by
the
king
of
the
fishes
and
the
king
of
the
birds
the
eagle
carries
a
letter
to
the
captive
princess
who
obtains
the
ring
from
the
magician
rubs
it
on
a
stone
and
when
it
asks
what
she
wishes
answers
i
wish
this
palace
to
return
where
it
first
was
and
the
magician
to
be
drowned
in
the
sea
of
almost
equal
popularity
is
the
story
of
the
forty
thieves
who
are
however
in
the
italian
versions
reduced
to
thirteen
twelve
or
six
in
number
the
versions
in
pitrè
no
and
variants
contain
but
one
incident
of
the
original
story
where
the
robbers
are
detected
in
the
and
killed
by
pouring
boiling
oil
over
them
in
one
of
versions
the
robbers
are
hidden
in
sacks
of
charcoal
and
the
cunning
daughter
pierces
the
bags
with
a
spit
in
another
they
are
hidden
in
and
sold
to
the
abbess
of
a
certain
convent
for
oil
one
of
the
nuns
has
some
suspicion
of
the
trick
and
invites
her
companions
to
tap
the
skins
with
irons

and
as
it
is
also
the
subject
of

it
may
have
been
borrowed
from
the
french
or
what
is
more
likely
both
french
and
italians
took
it
from
a
common
source
the
fable
of
the

and
the
magic
grapes

the
italian
version
follows
closely
the
oriental
original
the
same
may
be
said
of
another
story
in
the
same
collection
no
the
traveller
from
turin
which
is
nothing
but
sindbad
fourth
voyage
the
last
story
taken
from
the
arabian
nights
which
we
shall
mention
is
that
of
the
second
royal
mendicant
found
in

happiness

the
basilicata
and
in
the
collection
of
mantuan
stories
the
latter
no
is
entitled
there
is
no
longer
any
devil
the
magician
is
the
devil
and
the
story
concludes
after
the
transformations
in
which
the
peasant
son
kills
the
devil
in
the
shape
of
a
hen
with
the
words
and
this
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
longer
any
devil
the
first
collection
of
oriental
tales
known
in
europe
as
a
collection
was
the
that
is
instruction
or
teaching
for
clerks
or
clergymen
it
was
the
work
of
a
converted
spanish
jew
petrus
alphonsi
and
was
composed
before
the
date
of
the
baptism
of
the
author
the
time
and
place
of
whose
death
are
not
known
the
was
early
translated
into
french
prose
and
poetry
and
was
the
storehouse
from
which
all
subsequent
drew
abundant
material
precisely
how
the
became
known
in
italy
we
can
not
tell
but
the
separate
stories
must
have
become
popular
and
diffused
by
word
of
mouth
at
a
very
early
date
one
of
the
stories
of
this
collection
is
found
in
italian
literature
as
early
as
the
novelle
four
of
the
stories
in
the
are
found
in
pitrè
and
other
collections
of
popular
tales
and
although
belonging
with
one
exception
to
the
class
of
jests
they
are
mentioned
here
for
the
sake
of
completeness
in
one
of
the
stories
of
the
two
citizens
of
a
certain
town
and
a
countryman
were
making
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
together
and
on
the
way
ran
so
short
of
food
that
they
had
only
flour
enough
left
to
make
one
small
loaf
the
two
citizens
in
order
to
cheat
the
countryman
out
of
his
share
devised
the
following
scheme
while
the
bread
was
baking
they
proposed
that
all
three
should
sleep
and
whoever
should
have
the
most
remarkable
dream
should
have
the
whole
loaf
while
the
citizens
were
asleep
the
countryman
who
had
divined
their
plan
stole
the
bread
from
the
fire
ate
it
and
then
threw
himself
down
again
one
of
the
other
two
pretended
to
wake
up
in
a
fright
and
told
his
companion
that
he
had
dreamed
that
two
angels
had
led
him
through
the
gates
of
heaven
into
the
presence
of
god
the
other
declared
that
he
had
been
led
by
two
angels
into
the
the
countryman
heard
all
this
and
still
pretended
to
sleep
when
his
companions
aroused
him
he
asked
in
amazement
who
are
those
calling
me
they
answered
we
are
your
companions
what
said
he
have
you
got
back
already
where
have
we
been
to
in
order
to
return
the
countryman
replied
it
seemed
to
me
that
two
angels
led
one
of
you
to
heaven
and
afterwards
two
others
conducted
the
other
to
hell
from
this
i
imagined
that
neither
of
you
would
return
so
i
got
up
and
ate
the
bread
the
same
story
is
told
in
pitrè
no
of
a
monk
who
was
an
itinerant
preacher
and
who
was
accompanied
on
his
journey
by
a
very
cunning
lay
brother
one
day
the
monk
received
a
present
of
some
fish
which
he
wished
to
eat
himself
alone
and
therefore
proposed
to
the
brother
that
the
one
of
them
who
dreamed
the
best
dream
should
have
all
the
fish
the
dreams
and
the
conclusion
are
the
same
as
in
the
original
the
next
story
is
well
known
from
the
use
made
of
it
by
cervantes
in
don
quixote
part
chap
xx
where
sancho
relates
it
to
beguile
the
hours
of
the
memorable
night
when
the
noise
of
the
so
terrified
the
doughty
knight
and
his
squire
the
version
in
the
is
as
follows
a
certain
king
had
a
who
told
him
five
stories
every
night
it
happened
once
that
the
king
oppressed
by
cares
of
state
was
unable
to
sleep
and
asked
for
more
than
the
usual
number
of
stories
the
related
three
short
ones
the
king
wished
for
more
still
and
when
the
demurred
said
you
have
told
me
several
very
short
ones
i
want
something
long
and
then
you
may
go
to
sleep
the
yielded
and
began
thus
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
certain
countryman
who
went
to
market
and
bought
two
thousand
sheep
on
his
way
home
a
great
inundation
took
place
so
that
he
was
unable
to
cross
a
certain
river
by
the
ford
or
bridge
after
anxiously
seeking
some
means
of
getting
across
with
his
flock
he
found
at
length
a
little
boat
in
which
he
could
convey
two
sheep
over
after
the
had
got
thus
far
he
went
to
sleep
the
king
roused
him
and
ordered
him
to
finish
the
story
he
had
begun
the
answered
the
flood
is
great
the
boat
small
and
the
flock
innumerable
let
the
aforesaid
countryman
get
his
sheep
over
and
i
will
finish
the
story
i
have
begun
the
version
in
pitrè
no
lacks
all
connection
and
is
poor
but
we
give
it
here
as
it
is
very
brief
xxxix
the
treasure
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
prince
who
studied
and
racked
his
brains
so
much
that
he
learned
magic
and
the
art
of
finding
hidden
treasures
one
day
he
discovered
a
treasure
in
a
bank
let
us
say
the
bank
of
ddisisa
oh
he
says
now
i
am
going
to
get
it
out
but
to
get
it
out
it
was
necessary
that
ten
million
million
ants
should
cross
one
by
one
the
river
gianquadara
let
us
suppose
it
was
that
one
in
a
bark
made
of
the
half
shell
of
a
nut
the
prince
puts
the
bark
in
the
river
and
begins
to
make
the
ants
pass
over
one
two
three
and
he
is
still
doing
it
here
the
person
who
is
telling
the
story
pauses
and
says
we
will
finish
this
story
when
the
ants
have
finished
passing
over
the
version
from
milan
is
still
shorter
xl
the
shepherd
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
shepherd
who
went
to
feed
his
sheep
in
the
fields
and
he
had
to
cross
a
stream
and
he
took
the
sheep
up
one
by
one
to
carry
them
over
what
then
go
on
when
the
sheep
are
over
i
will
finish
the
story
in
chapter
we
shall
meet
two
popular
figures
in
sicilian
tales
whose
jokes
are
repeated
elsewhere
as
detached
stories
one
of
these
persons
is
firrazzanu
the
practical
joker
and
knave
who
is
cunning
enough
to
make
others
bear
the
penalty
of
his
own
boldness
in
the
story
in
pitrè
no
var
firrazzanu
master
wants
a
tailor
for
some
work
and
firrazzanu
tells
him
he
knows
of
one
who
is
good
but
subject
to
fits
which
always
make
their
approach
known
by
a
twitching
of
the
mouth
and
the
only
remedy
for
them
is
a
sound
beating
of
course
when
the
unlucky
tailor
begins
to
cut
his
cloth
he
twists
his
mouth
and
receives
to
his
amazement
a
sudden
beating
in
this
version
there
is
no
reason
given
why
firrazzanu
should
play
such
a
joke
on
the
innocent
tailor
in
the
original
however
a
motive
is
given
for
the
trick
the
last
story
we
shall
mention
from
the
is
the
one
known
in
pitrè
no
as
xli
the
three
admonitions
a
man
once
left
his
country
to
go
to
foreign
parts
and
there
entered
the
service
of
an
abbot
after
he
had
spent
some
time
in
faithful
service
he
desired
to
see
his
wife
and
native
land
he
said
to
the
abbot
sir
i
have
served
you
thus
long
but
now
i
wish
to
return
to
my
country
yes
my
son
said
the
abbot
but
before
departing
i
must
give
you
the
three
hundred
ounces
c
that
i
have
put
together
for
you
will
you
be
satisfied
with
three
admonitions
or
with
the
three
hundred
ounces
the
servant
answered
i
will
be
satisfied
with
the
three
admonitions
then
listen
first
when
you
change
the
old
road
for
the
new
you
will
find
troubles
which
you
have
not
looked
for
second
see
much
and
say
little
third
think
over
a
thing
before
you
do
it
for
a
thing
deliberated
is
very
fine
take
this
loaf
of
bread
and
break
it
when
you
are
truly
happy
footnote
c
the
ounce
is
equivalent
to
nearly
thirteen
francs
the
good
man
departed
and
on
his
journey
met
other
travellers
these
said
to
him
we
are
going
to
take
the
will
you
come
with
us
but
he
remembering
the
three
admonitions
of
his
master
answered
no
my
friends
i
will
keep
on
this
road
when
he
had
gone
half
way
bang
bang
he
heard
some
shots
what
was
that
my
sons
the
robbers
had
killed
his
companions
i
have
gained
the
first
hundred
ounces
he
said
and
continued
his
journey
on
his
way
he
arrived
at
an
inn
as
hungry
as
a
dog
and
called
for
something
to
eat
a
large
dish
of
meat
was
brought
which
seemed
to
say
eat
me
eat
me
he
stuck
his
fork
in
it
and
turned
it
over
and
was
frightened
out
of
his
wits
for
it
was
human
flesh
he
wanted
to
ask
the
meaning
of
such
food
and
give
the
innkeeper
a
lecture
but
just
then
he
thought
see
much
and
say
little
so
he
remained
silent
the
innkeeper
came
he
settled
his
bill
and
took
leave
but
the
innkeeper
stopped
him
and
said
bravo
bravo
you
have
saved
your
life
all
those
who
have
questioned
me
about
my
food
have
been
soundly
beaten
killed
and
nicely
cooked
i
have
gained
the
second
hundred
ounces
said
the
good
man
who
did
not
think
his
skin
was
safe
until
then
when
he
reached
his
own
country
he
remembered
his
house
saw
the
door
ajar
and
slipped
in
he
looked
about
and
saw
no
one
only
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
table
well
set
with
two
glasses
two
forks
two
seats
service
for
two
how
is
this
he
said
i
left
my
wife
alone
and
here
i
find
things
arranged
for
two
there
is
some
trouble
so
he
hid
himself
under
the
bed
to
see
what
went
on
a
moment
after
he
saw
his
wife
enter
who
had
gone
out
a
short
time
before
for
a
pitcher
of
water
a
little
after
he
saw
a
sprucely
dressed
young
priest
come
in
and
seat
himself
at
the
table
ah
is
that
he
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
coming
forth
and
giving
him
a
sound
beating
but
there
came
to
his
mind
the
final
admonition
of
the
abbot
think
over
a
thing
before
you
do
it
for
a
thing
deliberated
is
very
fine
and
he
refrained
he
saw
them
both
sit
down
at
the
table
but
before
eating
his
wife
turned
to
the
young
priest
and
said
my
son
let
us
say
our
accustomed
paternoster
for
your
father
when
he
heard
this
he
came
from
under
the
bed
crying
and
laughing
for
joy
and
embraced
and
kissed
them
both
so
that
it
was
affecting
to
see
him
then
he
remembered
the
loaf
his
master
had
given
him
and
told
him
to
eat
in
his
happiness
he
broke
the
loaf
and
there
fell
on
the
table
all
the
three
hundred
ounces
which
the
master
had
secretly
put
in
the
loaf
we
now
turn
to
some
stories
taken
from
a
collection
more
famous
in
some
respects
than
those
previously
mentioned
the
seven
wise
masters
which
enjoyed
during
the
middle
ages
a
popularity
second
only
to
that
of
the
bible
of
this
collection
there
are
several
italian
translations
reaching
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
from
one
of
these
or
possibly
from
oral
tradition
the
stories
about
to
be
mentioned
passed
into
the
popular
tales
of
italy
the
first
story
we
shall
cite
is
interesting
because
popular
tradition
has
connected
it
with
pier
delle
vigne
the
famous
chancellor
of
the
emperor
frederick
the
second
the
venetian
version
bernoni
pop
punt
is
in
substance
as
follows
xlii
vineyard
i
was
and
vineyard
i
am
a
king
averse
to
marriage
commanded
his
steward
to
remain
single
the
latter
however
one
day
saw
a
beautiful
girl
named
vigna
and
married
her
secretly
although
he
kept
her
closely
confined
in
her
chamber
the
king
became
suspicious
and
sent
the
steward
off
on
an
embassy
after
his
departure
the
king
entered
the
apartment
occupied
by
him
and
saw
his
officer
wife
sleeping
he
did
not
disturb
her
but
in
leaving
the
room
dropped
one
of
his
gloves
accidentally
on
the
bed
when
the
husband
returned
he
found
it
but
kept
a
discreet
silence
ceasing
however
all
demonstrations
of
affection
believing
his
wife
had
been
faithless
the
king
anxious
to
see
again
the
beautiful
woman
made
a
feast
and
ordered
the
steward
to
bring
his
wife
he
denied
in
vain
that
he
had
one
but
brought
her
at
last
and
while
every
one
else
was
talking
gayly
at
the
feast
she
was
silent
the
king
observed
it
and
asked
her
the
cause
of
her
silence
and
she
answered
with
a
pun
on
her
name
vineyard
i
was
and
vineyard
i
am
i
was
loved
and
no
longer
am
i
know
not
for
what
reason
the
vineyard
has
lost
its
season
her
husband
who
heard
this
replied
vineyard
thou
wast
and
vineyard
thou
art
loved
thou
wast
and
no
longer
art
the
vineyard
has
lost
its
season
for
the
lion
claw
the
king
who
understood
what
he
meant
answered
i
entered
the
vineyard
i
touched
the
leaves
but
i
swear
by
my
crown
that
i
have
not
tasted
the
fruit
then
the
steward
understood
that
his
wife
was
innocent
and
the
two
made
peace
and
always
after
lived
happy
and
contented
this
story
is
found
only
in
the
greek
and
hebrew
versions
of
the
seven
wise
masters
and
in
the
arabic
seven
viziers
it
did
not
pass
into
any
of
the
occidental
versions
although
it
was
known
to
boccaccio
who
based
on
it
the
fifth
novel
of
the
first
day
of
the
decameron
either
then
the
story
is
a
late
adaptation
of
the
oriental
tale
which
is
unlikely
or
it
comes
from
some
now
lost
but
once
popular
italian
version
of
the
oriental
form
of
the
seven
wise
masters
the
three
following
stories
are
found
only
in
the
western
or
european
versions
of
the
collection
the
first
technically
called
or
the
prophecy
relates
that
a
son
who
understood
the
language
of
birds
heard
the
prediction
that
his
father
and
mother
should
come
to
such
want
that
they
would
not
have
bread
to
eat
but
that
he
the
son
should
rise
so
high
that
his
father
should
offer
him
water
to
wash
his
hands
with
the
father
enraged
at
this
prediction
threw
his
son
into
the
sea
he
was
rescued
and
after
many
adventures
married
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
sicily
one
day
while
riding
through
messina
he
saw
his
father
and
mother
meanly
dressed
sitting
at
the
door
of
an
inn
he
alighted
from
his
horse
entered
their
house
and
asked
for
food
after
his
father
and
mother
had
brought
him
water
to
wash
his
hands
he
revealed
himself
to
them
and
forgave
his
father
for
his
cruelty

only
italian
version
and
disfigured
by
some
extraneous
details

the
mantuan
tales

no
fortune
aid
me
here
the
son
does
not
hear
the
prophecy
from
the
birds
but
an
angel
tells
a
king
who
has
long
desired
a
son
that
he
shall
have
one
whom
he
shall
one
day
serve
when
the
child
was
ten
years
old
the
king
was
so
vexed
by
the
prediction
that
he
exposed
his
son
in
a
wood
the
child
was
found
by
a
magician
who
brought
him
up
and
from
whom
he
afterwards
escaped
he
went
to
the
court
of
the
king
his
father
and
won
the
hand
of
the
princess
his
own
sister
by
leaping
his
horse
over
a
broad
ditch
at
the
marriage
banquet
the
king
handed
his
son
a
glass
of
wine
and
the
latter
recognized
him
and
exclaimed
behold
the
father
serves
the
son
the
marriage
was
of
course
given
up
and
the
previous
aversion
of
the
sister
explained
closely
connected
with
the
original
story
in
the
seven
wise
masters
is
the
class
of
stories
where
the
hero
is
acquainted
with
the
language
of
animals
and
attains
by
means
of
it
some
high
position
generally
becoming
pope
after
he
has
been
driven
from
home
by
his
father
the
following
version
is
from
monferrato
comparetti
no
and
is
entitled
xliii
the
language
of
animals
a
father
once
had
a
son
who
spent
ten
years
in
school
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
teacher
wrote
the
father
to
take
away
his
son
because
he
could
not
teach
him
anything
more
the
father
took
the
boy
home
and
gave
a
grand
banquet
in
his
honor
to
which
he
invited
the
most
noble
gentlemen
of
the
country
after
many
speeches
by
those
gentlemen
one
of
the
guests
said
to
the
host
son
just
tell
us
some
fine
thing
that
you
have
learned
i
have
learned
the
language
of
dogs
of
frogs
and
of
birds
there
was
universal
laughter
on
hearing
this
and
all
went
away
ridiculing
the
pride
of
the
father
and
the
foolishness
of
the
son
the
former
was
so
ashamed
at
his
son
answer
and
so
angry
at
him
that
he
gave
him
up
to
two
servants
with
orders
to
take
him
into
a
wood
and
kill
him
and
to
bring
back
his
heart
the
two
servants
did
not
dare
to
obey
this
command
and
instead
of
the
lad
they
killed
a
dog
and
carried
its
heart
to
their
master
the
youth
fled
from
the
country
and
came
to
a
castle
a
long
way
off
where
lived
the
treasurer
of
the
prince
who
had
immense
treasures
there
he
asked
for
and
obtained
a
lodging
but
scarcely
had
he
entered
the
house
when
a
multitude
of
dogs
collected
about
the
castle
the
treasurer
asked
the
young
man
why
so
many
dogs
had
come
and
as
the
latter
understood
their
language
he
answered
that
it
meant
that
a
hundred
assassins
would
attack
the
castle
that
very
evening
and
that
the
treasurer
should
take
his
precautions
the
castellan
made
two
hundred
soldiers
place
themselves
in
ambush
about
the
castle
and
at
night
they
arrested
the
assassins
the
treasurer
was
so
grateful
to
the
youth
that
he
wished
to
give
him
his
daughter
but
he
replied
that
he
could
not
remain
now
but
that
he
would
return
within
a
year
and
three
days
after
he
left
that
castle
he
arrived
at
a
city
where
the
king
daughter
was
very
ill
because
the
frogs
which
were
in
a
fountain
near
the
palace
gave
her
no
rest
with
their
croaking
the
lad
perceived
that
the
frogs
croaked
because
the
princess
had
thrown
a
cross
into
the
fountain
and
as
soon
as
it
was
removed
the
girl
recovered
the
king
too
wished
the
lad
to
marry
her
but
he
again
said
that
he
would
return
within
a
year
and
three
days
after
leaving
the
king
he
set
out
for
rome
and
on
the
way
met
three
young
men
who
became
his
companions
one
day
it
was
very
warm
and
all
three
lay
down
to
sleep
under
an
oak
immediately
a
great
flock
of
birds
flew
into
the
oak
and
awakened
the
pilgrims
by
their
loud
singing
one
of
them
asked
why
are
these
birds
singing
so
joyfully
the
youth
answered
they
are
rejoicing
with
the
new
pope
who
is
to
be
one
of
us
and
suddenly
a
dove
alighted
on
his
head
and
in
truth
shortly
after
he
was
made
pope
then
he
sent
for
his
father
the
treasurer
and
the
king
all
presented
themselves
trembling
for
they
knew
that
they
had
committed
some
sin
but
the
pope
made
them
all
relate
their
deeds
and
then
turned
to
his
father
and
said
i
am
the
son
whom
you
sent
to
be
killed
because
i
said
i
understood
the
language
of
birds
of
dogs
and
of
frogs
you
have
treated
me
thus
and
on
the
other
hand
a
treasurer
and
a
king
have
been
very
grateful
for
this
knowledge
of
mine
the
father
repenting
his
fault
wept
bitterly
and
his
son
pardoned
him
and
kept
him
with
him
while
he
lived
the
next
story
is
doubly
interesting
because
it
is
found
not
only
in
the
mediæval
collection
last
mentioned
but
also
in
greek
literature
being
told
of
rampsinitus
king
of
egypt
by
herodotus
ii
and
by
pausanias
of
the
two
architects
agamedes
and
trophonius
who
robbed
the
treasury
of
hyrieus

we
give
a
translation
of
the
last
named
version
which
is
called
xliv
the
mason
and
his
son
there
was
once
a
mason
who
had
a
wife
and
son
one
day
the
king
sent
for
the
mason
to
build
a
in
which
to
put
his
money
for
he
was
very
rich
and
had
no
place
to
keep
it
the
mason
set
to
work
with
his
son
in
one
corner
they
put
in
a
stone
that
could
be
taken
out
and
put
back
large
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
when
the
house
was
finished
the
king
paid
them
and
they
went
home
the
king
then
had
his
money
carted
to
the
house
and
put
guards
around
it
after
a
few
days
he
saw
that
no
one
went
there
and
took
away
the
guard
let
us
leave
the
king
who
took
away
the
guard
and
return
to
the
mason
when
his
money
was
gone
he
said
to
his
son
shall
we
go
to
the
they
took
a
sack
and
went
there
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
they
took
out
the
stone
and
the
father
entered
and
filled
the
bag
with
gold
when
he
came
out
he
put
the
stone
back
as
it
was
before
and
they
departed
the
next
day
the
king
rode
out
to
his
house
and
saw
that
his
pile
of
gold
had
diminished
he
said
to
his
servants
who
has
been
taking
the
money
the
servants
answered
it
is
not
possible
your
majesty
for
who
comes
here
where
could
they
get
in
it
may
be
that
the
house
has
settled
being
newly
built
so
they
took
and
repaired
it
after
a
while
the
mason
said
again
to
his
son
let
us
go
back
there
they
took
the
accustomed
sack
and
went
there
arriving
as
usual
they
took
out
the
stone
and
the
father
entered
filled
the
sack
and
they
departed
the
same
night
they
made
another
trip
filled
the
same
sack
again
and
went
away
the
next
day
the
king
visited
the
house
with
his
soldiers
and
councillors
when
he
entered
he
went
to
see
the
money
and
it
was
very
greatly
diminished
he
turned
to
his
councillors
and
said
some
one
comes
here
and
takes
the
money
the
councillors
said
but
your
majesty
while
you
are
saying
so
one
thing
can
be
done
take
a
few
tubs
fill
them
with
melted
pitch
and
place
them
around
the
walls
on
the
inside
whoever
enters
will
fall
in
them
and
the
thief
is
found
they
took
the
tubs
and
put
them
inside
and
the
king
left
sentinels
and
returned
to
the
city
the
sentinels
remained
there
a
week
but
as
they
saw
no
one
they
too
left
let
us
leave
the
sentinels
who
have
departed
and
return
to
the
mason
he
said
to
his
son
let
us
go
to
the
accustomed
place
they
took
the
sack
and
went
arriving
there
they
took
out
the
stone
and
the
father
entered
as
he
entered
he
stuck
fast
in
the
pitch
he
tried
to
help
himself
and
get
his
feet
loose
but
his
hands
stuck
fast
then
he
said
to
his
son
do
you
hear
what
i
tell
you
my
son
cut
off
my
head
tear
my
coat
to
pieces
put
back
the
stone
as
it
was
and
throw
my
head
in
the
river
so
that
i
shall
not
be
known
the
son
did
as
he
was
told
and
returned
home
when
he
told
his
mother
what
had
become
of
his
father
she
began
to
tear
her
hair
after
a
few
days
the
son
who
did
not
know
any
trade
entered
the
service
of
a
carpenter
and
told
his
mother
not
to
say
anything
as
if
nothing
had
happened
let
us
leave
these
and
return
to
the
king
who
went
the
next
day
with
his
councillors
to
the
they
entered
and
saw
the
body
and
the
king
said
but
it
has
no
head
how
shall
we
find
out
who
it
is
the
councillors
said
take
him
and
carry
him
through
the
streets
three
days
where
you
see
weeping
you
will
know
who
it
is
they
took
the
body
and
called
filippu
carruba
and
brasi
vutùru
d
and
made
them
carry
it
about
when
they
passed
through
the
street
where
the
widow
lived
she
began
to
weep
the
son
whose
shop
was
near
by
heard
it
and
gave
himself
a
blow
in
the
hand
with
an
axe
and
cut
off
his
fingers
the
police
arrested
the
mother
saying
we
have
found
out
who
it
is
meanwhile
the
son
arrived
there
and
said
she
is
not
weeping
for
that
she
is
weeping
because
i
have
cut
off
my
fingers
and
can
no
longer
work
and
earn
my
bread
the
police
saw
it
was
so
believed
him
and
departed
at
night
they
carried
the
body
to
the
palace
and
built
outside
a
scaffold
to
put
the
body
on
because
they
had
to
carry
it
around
three
days
about
the
scaffold
they
placed
nine
sentinels
eight
soldiers
and
a
corporal
now
it
was
in
the
winter
and
was
very
cold
so
the
son
took
a
mule
and
loaded
it
with
drugged
wine
and
passed
up
and
down
when
the
soldiers
saw
him
they
cried
friend
are
you
selling
that
wine
he
said
i
am
wait
until
we
drink
for
we
are
trembling
with
the
cold
after
they
had
drunk
they
threw
themselves
down
and
went
to
sleep

the
son
took
the
body

he
had
buried
it

a
talking
bird
that
is
a
spy
upon
his
actions
in
order
to
impair
his
confidence
in
the
bird
one
night
while
he
is
absent
the
wife
orders
a
servant
to
shower
water
over
the
cage
to
make
a
heavy
sound
like
thunder
and
to
imitate
the
flashing
of
lightning
with
candles
the
bird
on
its
master
return
tells
him
of
the
terrific
storm
the
night
before
and
is
killed
for
its
supposed
falsehood
this
story
is
found
in
both
the
eastern
and
western
versions
of
the
seven
wise
masters
and
practically
constitutes
the
framework
of
another
famous
oriental
collection
the
çukasaptati
from
a
parrot
and
seventy
the
seventy
tales
of
a
parrot
better
known
by
its
persian
and
turkish
name
tales
of
a
parrot
the
frame
or
groundwork
of
the
various
oriental
versions
is
substantially
the
same
a
husband
is
obliged
to
leave
home
on
business
and
while
he
is
absent
his
wife
engages
in
a
love
affair
with
a
stranger
a
parrot
which
the
husband
has
left
behind
prevents
the
wife
meeting
her
lover
by
telling
her
stories
which
interest
her
so
much
that
she
keeps
putting
off
her
appointment
until
her
husband
returns
in
the
turkish
version
the
parrot
reconciles
the
husband
and
wife
in
the
persian
versions
the
parrot
relates
what
has
happened
and
the
faithless
wife
is
killed
the
italian
versions
as
will
soon
be
seen
are
not
derived
from
the
seven
wise
masters
but
from
the
çukasaptati
and
what
is
very
curious
the
framework
has
been
retained
and
filled
with
stories
that
are
not
in
the
original
the
most
simple
version
is
from
pisa
comparetti
no
and
is
called
xlv
the
parrot
first
version
there
was
once
a
merchant
who
had
a
beautiful
daughter
with
whom
the
king
and
the
viceroy
were
both
in
love
the
former
knew
that
the
merchant
would
soon
have
to
depart
on
business
and
he
would
then
have
a
chance
to
speak
with
the
girl
the
viceroy
knew
it
too
and
pondered
on
how
he
could
prevent
the
king
succeeding
in
his
plan
he
was
acquainted
with
a
witch
and
promised
her
immunity
and
a
large
sum
of
money
if
she
would
teach
him
how
to
change
himself
into
a
parrot
this
she
did
and
of
course
the
merchant
bought
him
for
his
daughter
and
departed
when
the
parrot
thought
it
was
about
time
for
the
king
to
come
he
said
to
the
girl
now
to
amuse
you
i
will
tell
you
a
story
but
you
must
attend
to
me
and
not
see
any
one
while
i
am
telling
it
then
he
began
his
story
and
after
he
had
gone
a
little
way
in
it
a
servant
entered
and
told
her
mistress
that
there
was
a
letter
for
her
tell
her
to
bring
it
later
said
the
parrot
and
now
listen
to
me
i
do
not
receive
letters
while
my
father
is
away
said
the
mistress
and
the
parrot
continued
after
a
while
another
interruption
a
servant
announces
the
visit
of
an
aunt
it
was
not
an
aunt
but
a
woman
who
came
from
the
king
the
parrot
said
do
not
receive
her
we
are
in
the
finest
part
of
our
story
and
the
young
girl
sent
word
that
she
did
not
receive
any
visits
while
her
father
was
absent
and
the
parrot
went
on
when
his
story
was
ended
the
girl
was
so
pleased
that
she
would
listen
to
no
one
else
until
her
father
returned
then
the
parrot
disappeared
and
the
viceroy
visited
the
merchant
and
asked
his
daughter
hand
he
consented
and
the
marriage
took
place
that
very
day
the
wedding
was
scarcely
over
when
a
gentleman
came
to
ask
the
girl
hand
for
the
king
but
it
was
too
late
and
the
poor
king
who
was
much
in
love
with
her
died
of
a
broken
heart
and
the
girl
remained
the
wife
of
the
viceroy
who
had
been
more
cunning
than
the
king
we
have
omitted
the
story
told
by
the
parrot
because
we
shall
meet
it
again
in
the
sicilian
version
and
substantially
in
the
following
version
from
florence
which
we
give
entire
on
account
of
the
rarity
of
the
work
in
which
it
is
found
and
for
its
own
merits
it
is
also
entitled
xlvi
the
parrot
second
version
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
merchant
who
having
to
go
on
a
journey
gave
his
wife
a
parrot
to
amuse
her
in
her
loneliness
the
wife
vexed
that
her
husband
should
leave
her
so
soon
threw
the
bird
in
a
corner
and
thought
no
more
about
it
at
evening
she
went
to
the
window
and
saw
pass
a
young
man
who
fell
in
love
with
her
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
on
the
first
floor
there
lived
a
woman
who
sold
coals
and
the
young
man
began
to
tempt
her
to
help
him
in
his
love
affair
she
would
not
promise
because
the
merchant
wife
had
been
married
but
a
few
days
and
was
an
honest
woman
she
added
however
that
there
was
a
way
her
daughter
was
to
be
married
shortly
she
would
invite
the
young
wife
to
the
wedding
and
the
young
man
being
there
too
could
manage
the
rest
the
wife
accepted
the
invitation
dressed
herself
in
her
finest
clothes
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
when
the
parrot
cried
from
its
corner
o
mistress
where
are
you
going
i
wished
to
tell
you
a
story
but
suit
yourself
the
wife
then
dismissed
the
who
not
to
spoil
matters
promised
to
put
off
the
wedding
and
return
for
her
the
next
day
then
the
parrot
began
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
son
whose
master
was
so
learned
in
magic
that
with
certain
words
he
could
change
himself
into
various
animals
the
prince
wanted
to
learn
these
words
too
but
the
magician
hesitated
and
refused
although
he
had
to
yield
at
last
then
the
prince
became
a
crow
and
flew
far
away
to
a
distant
country
and
into
the
garden
of
a
king
where
he
saw
a
beautiful
girl
with
a
mirror
in
which
was
set
her
portrait
the
crow
in
wonder
snatched
the
glass
from
her
hands
and
flew
home
and
resumed
his
own
form
but
he
fell
so
deeply
in
love
with
the
unknown
girl
that
he
became
she
meanwhile
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
king
seeing
the
glass
taken
from
her
no
longer
had
any
peace
of
mind
and
begged
her
father
until
he
gave
her
permission
to
go
in
search
of
it
she
dressed
herself
like
a
physician
and
departed
she
came
to
a
city
and
heard
a
proclamation
by
the
king
that
whatever
physician
should
pass
that
way
should
be
obliged
to
visit
and
try
to
cure
his
daughter
then
the
new
physician
had
to
go
to
the
palace
but
she
could
not
discover
any
remedy
for
the
grave
disease
at
night
while
sitting
by
the
princess
bed
the
light
went
out
and
she
left
the
room
to
light
it
and
saw
in
a
little
cottage
three
old
women
sitting
around
a
cauldron
boiling
over
a

she
remained
there
some
time
and
promised
to
return

brighter
the
fire
burned
the
nearer
the
princess
came
to
death
the
physician
consoled
the
king
and
had
a
fine
supper

the
second
night

carried
food
and
a
great
deal
of
wine
to
the
old
women
and
when
they
were
drunk
threw
them
into
the
fire
and
lifted
off
the
cauldron
with
the
boiling
heads
the
princess
recovered
and
the
king
wished
to
give
her
to
the
physician
and
reward
him
with
gems
and
gold
but
the
physician
would
take
nothing
and
departed

know
mistress
it
is
late
and
i
am
tired
interrupted
the
parrot
i
will
tell
you

again
and
the
wife
was
on
the
point
of
accompanying
her
but
the
parrot
detained
her
promising
to
finish
the
story
so
the
woman
went
away
in
anger
and
the
parrot
continued

as
a

until
she
came
to
another
city
and

sitting
at
the
bedside
of
the
prince
she
heard
a
loud
noise
in
the
next
room

to

door
and
saw

old
women

were
preparing
a
banquet
afterwards
they
approached
the
invalid

him
from
head
to
foot
and
carried
him
healed
to
the
table
then
when
they
were
full
of
wine
and
merry
they
anointed
him
again
and
replaced
him
on
his
bed
worse
than
before
the
physician
comforted
the
king
and
the
second
night
allowed
the

but
the

at

made
the
invalid
disclose
the
secret
of

and
he
told

and
showed
the
portrait
of

and
as
she
appeared
before
the
prince
he
leaped
from

embracing
his

of
rejoicings
but
here
the
lady
hears

enters
and
inquires
about

bird
sees
the
parrot
hurt
upon
the
neighboring
roof
and
picks
it
up
kindly
the
parrot
narrates
to
him
the
wiles
of

assures
the
husband
that
his
wife
is
innocent
but
complains
of

being
so
ungrateful

had
promised
him
a
gold

has

the
sicilian

well
as
the
most
complete
of
all
the

continental
versions
has
been
expanded
into
three
and
the
frame

third

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
rich

as
good
as
the
day
was
long
and
who
loved
her
husband
desperately
one
day
she
saw
him
a

said
her
husband
and
he
laid
in
at
once
a
large
provision
of
bread
flour
oil
coals
and
everything
had
all
the
doors
and
windows
closed
up

remained
with
her

next
day
a
servant

at
the
wicket
to

what
was
necessary

ten
days
the
lady
began
to
be
oppressed
and

the
lady
perceived
them
and
withdrew
from

about
the
bet
and
had
no
rest
running
here
and
there
and
trying
to
speak
with
the
lady
at
last
the
notary
in
despair
went
out
into
the
fields
and
began
to
call
his
demon
the
demon
appeared
and
the
notary
told
him
everything
saying
and
this
cavalier
wishes
to
have
the
advantage
of
speaking

to
get

of
her
he
told
her
all
about
the
wager
the
old
woman
said
i

able
to
make
you
speak
with
the
lady
you
must
have
prepared
for
me
two
handsome
baskets
of
early
fruit
the
cavalier
was
so
anxious
to
see
the
lady
that
he
had
the
baskets
of
early
fruit
prepared
and
given
to
her
with
these
things
the
old
woman
went
to
the
wicket
pretending
that
she
was
the
lady

the
lady
believed
her
one
word

while
the
lady
was
being
persuaded
the
parrot
began
to
lament
when
its
mistress
opened
the
clothespress
the
parrot
said
my
pretty
mamma
do
go
for
the
old
woman
will
betray
you
if
you
do
go
i
will
tell
you
a
story
the
lady
took
an
idea
into
her
head
now
my
grandmother
she
said
go
away
for
i
can
not
come
and
the
old
woman
went
away
when
she
had
gone
the
lady
went
to
the
parrot
which
related
to
her
this
story
first
story
of
the
parrot
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
an
only
daughter
who
was
very
fond
of
dolls
and
had
one
that
was
her
delight
she
dressed
her
and
undressed
her
and
put
her
to
bed
in
short
did
for
her
what
is
done
for
children
one
day
the
king
wished
to
go
into
the
country
and
the
princess
wished
to
take
the
doll
while
they
were
walking
about
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
she
left
her
doll
on
a
hedge
it
was
meal
time
and
after
they
had
eaten
they
got
into
the
carriage
and
returned
to
the
royal
palace
what
do
you
suppose
the
princess
forgot
the
doll
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
palace
the
princess
remembered
the
doll
what
did
she
do
instead
of
going
she
turned
round
and
went
to
look
for
the
doll
when
she
got
outdoors
she
became
lost
and
wandered
about
like
a
person
bereft
of
her
senses
after
a
time
she
came
to
a
royal
palace
and
asked
who
was
the
king
of
that
palace
the
king
of
spain
they
said
she
asked
for
a
lodging
she
entered
the
king
gave
her
lodging
and
treated
her
like
a
daughter
she
made
herself
at
home
in
the
palace
and
began
to
be
the
mistress
the
king
had
no
daughters
and
gave
her
liberty
to
do
as
she
pleased
in
spite
of
twelve
royal
damsels
now
as
there
is
envy
among
equals
the
damsels
began
to
oppose
her
said
they
just
see
who
knows
who
she
is
and
is
she
to
be
our
princess
now
this
thing
must
stop
the
next
day
they
said
to
the
princess
will
you
come
with
us
no
because
papa
does
not
wish
it
if
he
is
willing
i
will
come
do
you
know
what
you
must
do
to
make
him
let
you
come
tell
him
the
soul
of
his
daughter
he
must
let
you
go
when
he
hears
that
he
will
let
you
go
at
once
the
princess
did
so
but
when
the
king
heard
her
say
by
the
soul
of
his
daughter
ah
wretch
exclaimed
the
king
quick
throw
her
down
the
when
the
princess
fell
down
the
she
found
a
door
then
another
and
another
always
feeling
her
way
along
at
a
certain
point
she
felt
with
her
hands
like
the
blind
and
found
tinder
and
matches
she
then
lighted
a
candle
which
she
found
there
and
saw
a
beautiful
young
girl
with
a
padlock
on
her
mouth
so
that
she
could
not
speak
but
she
made
signs
that
the
key
to
open
it
with
was
under
the
pillow
of
the
bed
the
princess
got
it
and
opened
the
padlock
then
the
young
girl
spoke
and
said
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
king
whom
a
magician
had
stolen
this
magician
brought
her
every
day
something
to
eat
and
then
locked
up
her
mouth
and
she
had
to
wait
until
the
next
day
to
open
it
again
but
tell
me
said
the
princess
what
way
is
there
to
free
you
how
do
i
know
i
can
do
nothing
but
ask
the
magician
when
he
opens
my
mouth
you
hide
under
the
bed
and
listen
and
afterwards
think
what
has
to
be
done
good
good
the
princess
locked
her
mouth
put
the
key
under
the
pillow
and
crawled
under
the
bed
but
at
midnight
a
great
noise
was
heard
the
earth
opened
lightning
smoke
and
smell
of
sulphur
and
the
magician
appeared
in
a
magician
robe
with
the
magician
was
a
giant
with
a
bowl
of
food
and
two
servants
with
two
torches
the
magician
sent
away
the
servants
and
locked
the
doors
took
the
key
and
opened
the
mouth
of
the
king
daughter
while
they
were
eating
she
said
magician
i
have
a
thought
out
of
curiosity
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
do
to
escape
from
here
you
want
to
know
a
great
deal
my
daughter
never
mind
i
do
care
to
know
however
i
will
tell
you
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
a
mine
all
around
the
palace
and
precisely
at
midnight
when
i
am
on
the
point
of
entering
to
explode
the
mine
you
will
find
yourself
with
your
father
and
i
will
fly
up
in
the
air
it
as
if
you
had
not
told
any
one
said
the
young
girl
the
magician
dressed
himself
and
went
away
after
a
few
hours
the
princess
came
out
from
under
the
bed
took
leave
of
her
little
sister
for
she
already
called
her
little
sister
and
departed
she
went
back
to
the
and
at
a
certain
point
stopped
and
called
for
help
the
king
heard
her
and
had
a
rope
lowered
the
princess
climbed
up
and
related
everything
to
the
king
he
was
astounded
and
began
the
mine
which
he
had
filled
with
shot
powder
and
balls
when
it
was
full
to
the
brim
the
princess
descended
with
a
watch
and
went
to
the
king
daughter
either
both
dead
or
both
alive
when
she
entered
the
room
she
said
it
is
i
took
the
lock
from
her
mouth
talked
with
her
and
then
concealed
herself
under
the
bed
at
midnight
the
magician
came
and
the
king
was
on
the
lookout
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
princess
fired
the
mine
boom
and
a
great
noise
was
heard
the
magician
vanished
and
the
two
young
girls
found
themselves
free
and
in
each
other
arms
when
the
king
saw
them
he
exclaimed
ah
my
daughters
your
misfortune
was
your
good
fortune
my
crown
belongs
to
you
said
he
to
the
princess
whom
he
had
adopted
no
your
majesty
for
i
am
a
king
daughter
and
i
too
have
a
crown
this
matter
spread
over
the
world
and
her
fame
passed
through
all
the
kingdoms
and
every
one
talked
of
nothing
but
the
great
courage
and
goodness
of
this
princess
who
had
delivered
the
other
princess
from
the
magician
and
they
remained
happy
and
always
enjoyed
holy
peace

once
upon
a
time

evening
there
was
great
confusion
the
young
girl
did
not
wish
to
knock
and
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
she
saw
a
light
at
a
distance
so
she
descended
by
a
ladder
of
silk
taking
with
her
a
candle
when
she
drew
near
the
light
she
saw
a
large
cauldron
placed
on
some
stones
and
a
furnace
under
it
and
a
turk
who
was
stirring
it
with
a

she

and
found
the

fainted
on
the
floor
she
brought
her
to

d
and
in
three
days
she
had

then
she
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
king
entered
beside
himself
at
finding
his
daughter
cured

said
to

she
closed
the
wicket
and
the
old
woman
went
away
grumbling
and
cursing
the
lady
then
seated
herself
near
the
parrot
which
told
this
story
third
story
of
the
parrot
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
and
a
queen
who
had
an
only
son
whose
sole
diversion
was
the
chase
once
he
wished
to
go
hunting
at
a
distance
and
took
with
him
his
attendants
where
do
you
think
he
happened
to
go
to
the
country
where
the
doll
was
i
when
he
saw
the
doll
he
said
i
have
finished
my
hunt
let
us
return
home
he
took
the
doll
and
placed
it
before
him
on
the
horse
and
exclaimed
every
few
minutes
how
beautiful
this
doll
is
think
of
its
mistress
when
he
reached
the
palace
he
had
a
glass
case
made
in
the
wall
and
put
the
doll
in
it
and
kept
looking
at
it
continually
and
saying
how
beautiful
the
doll
is
think
of
the
mistress
footnote
i
the
doll
of
the
first
story
the
young
man
would
not
see
any
one
and
became
so
melancholy
that
his
father
summoned
the
physicians
who
said
your
majesty
we
know
nothing
of
this
illness
see
what
he
does
with
his
doll
the
king
went
to
see
his
son
and
found
him
gazing
at
the
doll
and
exclaiming
oh
how
beautiful
the
doll
is
think
of
the
mistress
the
physicians
departed
as
wise
as
when
they
came
the
prince
meanwhile
did
nothing
but
sit
and
look
at
the
doll
and
draw
deep
breaths
and
sigh
and
exclaim
how
beautiful
the
doll
is
think
of
the
mistress
the
king
at
last
in
despair
summoned
his
council
and
said
see
how
my
son
is
reduced
he
has
no
fever
or
pain
in
his
head
but
he
is
wasting

her
if
her
father
will
not
let
her
come

war
with
him
the
king
sent
his
ambassadors
with
the
message
that
the
young
girl
should

while
the
ambassadors
were
in
the
presence
his

she
saw
him
drawing
such
deep
breaths
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
swallow
himself
and
always
exclaiming
oh

beautiful
the
doll
is

of
the
mistress
she
said

and
in
a
week
alive
and

or

she
shut
herself
up
with
him
and
listened
to
hear
what
the
prince
said
for
she
had
not
yet
heard
what
he
was
saying
he
was
so
feeble
when
she
heard
him
whisper
oh

is
the
doll
and
saw
the
doll
she
cried
ah

was
you
who
had
my
doll

it
to
me

when
he
heard
these
words
he
came
to
himself
and
said

doll
mistress

think
he
returned
to
life
and
she
began
to
give
him
broth
until
she
had
restored
him
when
he
was
restored
she
said
now

me
how
you
got
the
doll
and
the
prince
told
her
everything
to
make
the
matter
short
in
a
week
the
prince
was
cured
and
they
declared
that
they
would

and
when
the
joy
was
at
its
height
the
bird
threw
some
soup
in
its

the
master
when
he
felt
it
put

hands
to
his
eyes
and
the
parrot
darted
at
his
throat
strangled
him
and
flew
away
he
flew
away
to
the
country
and
saying
i
am
a
parrot
and
i
become
a

he
was
changed
into
a
handsome
cunning
and
man
on

met

said
the
notary
and
went
his
way
without
speaking
of

wager
the
notary
learned
that
the
lady
had
a
mother
and
went
to
her
to
ask
her
daughter
in
marriage
after
hesitating
the
lady
finally
said
yes
and
they
were
married
that
evening
the

the
notary
went

cavalier
to
get
the
four
hundred
ounces
of
the
wager
which
he
enjoyed
with
his
wife
the
three
stories
related
by
the
parrot
are
as
has
been
seen
in
reality
one
story
and
they
are
in
fact
found
as
such
independent
of
the
frame
it
has
also
been
seen
that
the
story
or
stories
related
by
the
parrot
are
substantially
the
same
in
all
the
versions
the
florentine
version
alone
does
not
contain
the
episode
of
the
doll
the
story
as
a
whole
has
no
parallels
although
it
bears
a
slight
resemblance
to
the
story
in
the
pentamerone
ii
green
meadow
the
princess
as
physician
and
the
secret
malady
of
the
prince
or
princess
are
traits
which
abound
in
all
the
popular
tales
of
europe
many
single
stories
of
oriental
origin
will
be
found
in
the
chapters
following
we
shall
close
this
one
with
a
story
which
was
popular
in
europe
during
the
middle
ages
being
found
in
one
of
the
great
collections
of
that
period
the
of
the
various
italian
versions
we
shall
select
one
from
pomigliano
called
xlviii
truthful
joseph
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
mother
who
had
a
son
named
joseph
and
because
he
never
told
a
lie
she
called
him
truthful
joseph
one
day
when
she
was
calling
him
the
king
happened
to
pass
by
and
hearing
her
call
him
thus
asked
her
why
do
you
call
him
truthful
joseph
because
he
never
tells
a
lie
then
the
king
said
that
he
would
like
to
have
him
in
his
service
and
set
him
to
keeping
his
cows
every
morning
joseph
presented
himself
to
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
servant
the
king
answered
good
morning
truthful
joseph
how
are
the
cows
well
and
fat
how
are
the
calves
well
and
handsome
how
is
the
bull
the
same
so
he
did
every
morning
the
king
praised
him
so
highly
in
the
presence
of
all
his
courtiers
that
they
became
angry
at
him
and
one
day
to
make
joseph
a
liar
they
sent
to
him
a
lady
who
was
to
induce
him
by
her
words
to
kill
the
bull
joseph
was
urged
so
strongly
that
he
consented
but
afterwards
he
was
in
great
perplexity
as
to
what
he
should
tell
the
king
so
he
put
his
cloak
on
a
chair
and
pretended
that
it
was
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
servant
good
morning
truthful
joseph
how
are
the
cows
well
and
fat
how
are
the
calves
well
and
handsome
how
is
the
bull
the
same
but
no
that
will
not
do
i
am
telling
a
lie
when
the
king
asks
me
how
the
bull
is
i
will
tell
him
that
it
is
dead
he
presented
himself
to
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
servant
good
morning
truthful
joseph
how
are
the
cows
well
and
fat
how
are
the
calves
well
and
handsome
how
is
the
bull
your
majesty
a
lady
came
and
with
her
manners
made
me
kill
the
bull
pardon
me
the
king
answered
bravo
truthful
joseph
he
summoned
his
courtiers
and
showed
them
that
joseph
had
not
yet
told
any
lie
and
so
joseph
remained
always
with
the
king
and
the
courtiers
were
duped
because
they
gained
nothing
that
they
had
expected
chapter
iv
legends
and
ghost
stories
the
italian
people
possess
an
inexhaustible
store
of
legends
which
they
have
inherited
from
the
middle
ages
with
the
great
mass
of
these
stories
legends
of
the
saints
or
local
legends
we
have
at
present
nothing
to
do
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
do
not
differ
materially
from
the
legends
of
the
other
catholic
peoples
of
europe
the
class
to
which
we
shall
devote
our
attention
in
this
chapter
is
that
of
popular
legendary
stories
which
have
clustered
around
the
person
of
our
lord
and
his
disciples
and
around
other
favorite
characters
of
mediæval
fancy
such
as
pilate
the
wandering
jew
etc
to
these
may
be
added
tales
relating
to
the
other
world
and
stories
which
are
of
a
legendary
nature
the
first
stories
which
we
shall
mention
are
those
referring
to
mythical
journeys
of
our
lord
and
his
apostles
the
first
peter
and
the
robbers
pitrè
no
relates
that
once
while
the
master
was
journeying
with
the
apostles
they
found
themselves
at
night
out
in
the
fields
and
took
shelter
in
a
cabin
belonging
to
some
shepherds
who
received
them
very
inhospitably
and
gave
them
nothing
to
eat
soon
after
a
band
of
robbers
attacked
the
flock
and
robbed
the
shepherds
who
ran
away
the
robbers
came
to
the
cabin
and
when
they
heard
from
the
apostles
how
shabbily
they
had
been
treated
gave
them
the
supper
that
the
shepherds
had
prepared
for
themselves
and
went
their
way
blessed
be
the
robbers
said
peter
for
they
treat
the
hungry
poor
better
than
the
rich
do
blessed
be
the
robbers
said
the
apostles
and
ate
their
fill
this
story
as
can
easily
be
seen
is
a
tradition
of
the
robbers
who
pretend
to
have
been
blessed
by
christ
peter
is
the
hero
of
several
stories
in
which
he
plays
anything
but
a
dignified
rôle
in
one
pitrè
no
he
is
sent
to
buy
some
wine
and
allows
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
the
wine
merchant
to
eat
some
after
this
he
can
not
distinguish
between
good
and
bad
wine
and
purchases
an
inferior
kind
when
the
master
tasted
it
he
said
eh
peter
peter
you
have
let
yourself
be
deceived
j
peter
tasted
it
again
and
saw
that
it
was
sour
another
apostle
was
sent
to
get
some
good
wine
and
hence
it
is
that
when
you
have
to
taste
wine
to
see
whether
it
is
good
you
must
not
eat
footnote
j
this
story
is
an
attempt
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
word
to
impose
on
one
by
the
word
the
lord
peter
and
the
apostles
once
while
the
master
was
on
a
journey
with
the
thirteen
apostles
they
came
to
a
village
where
there
was
no
bread
the
master
said
peter
let
each
one
of
you
carry
a
stone
they
each
took
up
a
stone
peter
a
little
bit
of
a
one
the
others
were
all
loaded
down
but
peter
went
along
very
easily
the
master
said
now
let
us
go
to
another
village
if
there
is
any
bread
there
we
shall
buy
it
if
there
is
none
i
will
give
you
my
blessing
and
the
stones
will
become
bread
they
went
to
another
town
put
the
stones
down
and
rested
the
master
gave
them
his
blessing
and
the
stones
became
bread
peter
who
had
carried
a
little
one
felt
his
heart
grow
faint
master
he
said
how
am
i
going
to
eat
eh
my
brother
why
did
you
carry
a
little
stone
the
others
who
loaded
themselves
down
have
bread
enough
then
they
went
on
and
the
master
made
them
each
carry
another
stone
peter
was
cunning
this
time
and
took
a
large
one
and
all
the
others
carried
small
ones
the
lord
said
to
the
others
little
ones
we
will
have
a
laugh
at
peter
expense
they
arrived
at
another
village
and
all
the
apostles
threw
away
their
stones
because
there
was
bread
there
and
peter
was
bent
double
for
he
had
carried
a
with
him
to
no
purpose
on
their
journey
they
met
a
man
and
as
peter
was
in
advance
of
the
others
he
said
the
lord
is
coming
shortly
ask
him
a
favor
for
your
soul
the
man
drew
near
and
said
lord
my
father
is
ill
with
old
age
cure
him
master
the
lord
said
am
i
a
physician
do
you
know
what
you
must
do
put
him
in
a
hot
oven
and
your
father
will
become
a
boy
again
they
did
so
and
his
father
became
a
little
boy
the
idea
pleased
peter
and
when
he
found
himself
alone
he
went
about
seeking
to
make
some
old
men
young
by
chance
there
met
him
one
who
was
seeking
the
master
because
his
mother
was
at
the
point
of
death
and
he
wanted
her
cured
peter
said
what
do
you
want
i
want
the
master
for
i
have
an
old
mother
who
is
very
ill
and
the
master
alone
can
cure
her
fortunately
peter
is
here
do
you
know
what
you
must
do
heat
an
oven
and
put
her
in
it
and
she
will
be
cured
the
poor
man
believed
him
for
he
knew
that
the
lord
loved
peter
so
he
went
home
and
immediately
put
his
mother
in
the
hot
oven
what
more
could
you
expect
the
old
woman
was
burned
to
a
coal
ah
di
ccà
e
di
ddà
k
cried
the
son
that
scurvy
fellow
has
made
me
kill
my
mother
he
hastened
to
peter
the
master
was
present
and
when
he
heard
the
story
could
not
control
his
laughter
and
said
ah
peter
what
have
you
done
peter
tried
to
excuse
himself
but
the
poor
man
kept
crying
for
his
mother
what
must
the
master
do
he
had
to
go
to
the
house
of
the
dead
and
with
a
blessing
which
he
there
pronounced
he
brought
the
old
woman
to
life
again
a
beautiful
young
girl
and
relieved
peter
of
his
great
embarrassment
footnote
k
this
is
the
strongest
imprecation
in
sicily
the
last
anecdote
is
quite
popular
and
is
found
in
a
number
of
popular
stories
as
well
as
in
the
novelle
a
very
amusing
version
is
from
venice
no
and
is
entitled
li
the
lord
peter
and
the
blacksmith
in
a
little
town
about
as
large
as
sehio
or
thiene
once
lived
a
a
good
industrious
and
skilful
man
but
so
proud
of
his
skill
that
he
would
not
deign
to
reply
to
anyone
who
did
not
address
him
as
professor
this
pride
in
a
man
otherwise
so
blameless
gave
universal
dissatisfaction
one
day
our
lord
appeared
in
the
shop
accompanied
by
peter
whom
he
was
always
in
the
habit
of
taking
with
him
on
such
excursions
professor
said
the
lord
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
permit
me
to
do
a
little
work
at
your
forge
why
not
it
is
at
your
service
replied
the
flattered
smith
what
do
you
wish
to
make
that
you
will
soon
see
said
the
lord
and
took
up
a
pair
of
tongs
with
which
he
seized
peter
and
held
him
in
the
forge
until
he
was
then
he
drew
him
out
and
hammered
him
on
all
sides
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
old
apostle
was
forged
anew
into
a
wonderfully
handsome
youth
with
beautiful
hair
the
blacksmith
stood
speechless
with
astonishment
while
the
lord
and
peter
exchanged
the
most
courteous
thanks
and
compliments
finally
the
recovered
himself
and
ran
straight
up
to
the
second
story
where
his
sick
old
father
lay
in
bed
father
he
cried
come
quickly
i
have
just
learned
how
to
make
a
strong
young
man
of
you
my
son
have
you
lost
your
senses
said
the
old
man
half
terrified
no
only
believe
me
i
have
just
seen
it
myself
finding
that
the
old
man
protested
against
the
attempt
his
son
seized
him
forcibly
carried
him
to
the
shop
and
in
spite
of
his
shrieks
and
entreaties
thrust
him
into
the
forge
but
brought
nothing
out
but
a
piece
of
charred
leg
which
fell
to
pieces
at
the
first
blow
of
the
hammer
then
he
was
seized
with
anguish
and
remorse
he
ran
quickly
in
search
of
the
two
men
and
fortunately
found
them
in
the
sir
he
cried
what
have
you
done
you
have
misled
me
i
wanted
to
imitate
your
skill
and
i
have
burned
my
father
alive
come
with
me
quickly
and
help
me
if
you
can
then
the
lord
smiled
graciously
and
said
go
home
comforted
you
will
find
your
father
alive
and
well
but
an
old
man
again
and
so
he
did
find
him
to
his
great
joy
from
that
time
his
pride
disappeared
and
whenever
any
one
called
him
professor
he
would
exclaim
ah
what
folly
that
is
there
are
gentlemen
in
venice
and
professors
in
padua
but
i
am
a
bungler
the
version
in
knust
is
different
it
is
called
a
journey
of
our
saviour
on
earth
and
is
in
substance
as
follows
a
father
whose
son
is
a
gambler
makes
him
become
a
soldier
the
son
deserts
during
a
stormy
night
and
takes
refuge
in
an
inn
there
he
meets
a
man
who
seems
acquainted
with
his
whole
life
and
whose
name
is
salvatore
saviour
he
knows
that
peter
has
deserted
and
is
pursued
but
he
will
save
him
to
gain
a
livelihood
he
proposes
to
him
to
travel
together
and
heal
the
sick
an
opportunity
to
do
this
is
soon
offered
a
rich
man
is
ill
and
salvatore
promises
to
heal
him
in
three
days
he
makes
every
one
withdraw
prepares
a
potion
from
herbs
and
cures
the
patient
the
relatives
of
the
rich
man
offer
in
their
gratitude
all
manner
of
costly
things
to
salvatore
who
however
accepts
only
enough
to
support
life
such
an
unreasonable
proceeding
enrages
his
companion
to
such
a
degree
that
he
parts
from
him
he
wishes
to
cure
people
independently
and
promises
a
king
to
heal
his
sick
daughter
at
once
but
although
he
does
everything
exactly
like
salvatore
the
only
effect
of
the
potion
is
to
kill
the
princess
as
soon
as
the
king
learns
this
he
has
peter
thrown
into
prison
on
his
way
there
he
meets
salvatore
who
is
ready
to
help
him
at
his
request
the
latter
goes
to
the
king
and
promises
to
raise
his
daughter
if
he
will
release
to
him
the
prisoner
the
king
consents
but
threatens
salvatore
with
death
in
case
of
failure
the
dead
however
comes
to
life
and
in
gratitude
offers
her
hand
through
her
father
to
salvatore
who
declares
that
it
is
his
vocation
to
wander
over
the
earth
he
asks
that
the
maiden
be
given
to
his
companion
in
a
story
from
venice
our
lord
and
peter
are
hospitably
received
by
a
poor
woman
who
has
no
bed
to
offer
them
but
makes
up
one
for
them
from
some
straw
and
five
ells
of
linen
which
she
has
bought
that
day
when
the
lord
departs
the
next
morning
he
bestows
on
the
woman
the
power
of
doing
all
day
the
first
thing
she
does
in
the
morning
she
begins
by
taking
the
linen
from
the
bed
of
her
guests
and
pulls
off
piece
after
piece
of
linen
a
friend
of
hers
learns
this
and
determines
to
do
the
same
but
is
punished
by
the
lord
for
her
selfishness
lii
in
this
world
one
weeps
and
another
laughs
once
the
lord
while
he
was
making
the
world
called
one
of
the
apostles
and
told
him
to
look
and
see
what
the
people
were
doing
the
apostle
looked
and
said
how
curious
the
people
are
weeping
the
lord
answered
it
is
not
the
world
yet
the
next
day
he
bade
the
apostle
look
again
and
see
what
the
people
were
doing
the
apostle
looked
and
saw
the
people
laughing
and
said
the
people
are
laughing
the
lord
answered
it
is
not
the
world
yet
the
third
day
he
made
him
look
again
and
the
apostle
saw
that
some
were
weeping
and
some
were
laughing
and
said
some
of
the
people
are
weeping
and
some
are
laughing
the
lord
said
now
it
is
the
world
because
in
this
world
one
weeps
and
another
laughs
the
next
legend
accounts
for
the
ass
long
ears
liii
the
ass
it
is
related
that
when
the
lord
created
the
world
he
also
made
all
the
animals
and
gave
each
its
name
he
also
created
the
ass
which
said
lord
what
is
my
name
your
name
is
ass
the
ass
went
away
well
pleased
after
a
while
it
forgot
its
name
and
went
back
to
the
lord
lord
what
is
my
name
ass
after
a
while
it
came
back
again
excuse
me
lord
what
is
my
name
ass
ass
the
ass
turned
and
went
away
but
forgot
it
another
time
and
came
back
lord
i
have
forgotten
my
name
the
lord
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
but
seized
its
ears
and
pulled
them
sharply
exclaiming
ass
ass
ass
the
ears
were
pulled
so
hard
that
they
became
long
and
that
is
why
the
ass
has
long
ears
and
why
we
pull
a
person
ears
to
keep
him
from
forgetting
a
thing
another
legend
relates
that
when
christ
was
journeying
through
the
world
he
happened
dying
with
thirst
to
enter
a
town
he
saw
a
woman
combing
her
hair
and
said
will
you
give
me
a
drink
of
water
for
i
am
dying
of
thirst
i
am
busy
it
is
not
the
time
for
water
christ
said
at
once
cursed
be
the
braid
that
is
braided
friday
and
continued
his
journey
after
a
time
he
saw
a
woman
making
dough
for
bread
good
woman
will
you
give
me
a
drink
of
water
as
much
as
you
will
and
went
and
drew
some
water
and
gave
him
christ
said
blessed
be
the
dough
that
is
kneaded
on
friday
hence
it
is
that
certain
women
are
accustomed
not
to
comb
their
hair
on
friday
there
is
a
satirical
legend
called
the
lord
will
which
relates
that
when
christ
came
to
leave
the
world
he
was
in
doubt
as
to
whom
to
leave
all
on
the
earth
if
he
left
it
to
the
gentlemen
what
would
the
nobility
do
if
to
the
nobility
what
would
become
of
the
gentry
and
the
workmen
and
the
peasants
while
he
was
reflecting
the
noblemen
came
and
asked
the
lord
to
give
them
everything
which
he
did
then
the
priests
came
and
when
they
were
told
that
everything
had
been
given
to
the
nobility
oh
the
devil
they
exclaimed
then
i
leave
you
the
devil
said
the
lord
to
the
monks
who
when
they
heard
what
had
been
done
exclaimed
patience
patience
was
left
the
workmen
cried
what
a
fraud
and
received
that
for
their
share
finally
the
peasants
came
and
said
with
resignation
let
us
do
the
will
of
god
and
that
was
their
portion
and
this
is
the
reason
why
in
this
world
the
noblemen
command
the
priests
are
helped
by
the
devil
the
monks
are
patient
workmen
fraudulent
and
the
peasants
have
to
do
many
things
they
want
to
and
are
obliged
to
submit
to
the
will
of
god
peter
mother
is
the
subject
of
a
story
which
has
given
rise
to
a
proverb
she
was
so
runs
the
story
an
avaricious
woman
who
never
was
known
to
do
good
to
any
one
in
fact
during
her
whole
life
she
never
gave
anything
away
except
the
top
of
an
onion
to
a
beggar
woman
after
her
death
peter
mother
went
to
hell
and
the
saint
begged
our
lord
to
release
her
in
consideration
of
her
one
charitable
act
an
angel
was
sent
to
draw
her
from
hell
with
an
the
other
lost
spirits
clutched
hold
of
her
skirts
in
order
to
escape
with
her
but
the
selfish
woman
tried
to
shake
them
off
and
in
her
efforts
to
do
so
broke
the
and
fell
back
into
hell
this
story
has
given
rise
to
the
saying
like
peter
mamma
which
is
found
with
slight
variations
all
over
italy
a
curious
version
of
this
story
is
given
in
bernoni
no
after
the
was
broken
and
peter
mother
had
fallen
back
into
hell
the
story
continues
out
of
regard
however
for
peter
the
lord
permitted
her
once
a
year
on
peter
day
to
leave
hell
and
wander
about
the
earth
a
week
and
indeed
she
does
so
every
year
and
during
this
week
she
plays
all
sorts
of
pranks
and
causes
great
trouble
peter
sisters
are
the
subject
of
a
story
with
a
moral
contained
in
schneller
liv
peter
and
his
sisters
peter
had
two
sisters
one
large
the
other
small
the
little
one
entered
a
convent
and
became
a
nun
peter
was
delighted
at
this
and
tried
to
persuade
his
big
sister
to
become
a
nun
also
she
would
not
listen
to
him
however
and
said
i
would
rather
marry
after
peter
had
suffered
martyrdom
he
became
as
is
well
known
porter
of
heaven
one
day
the
lord
said
to
him
peter
open
the
gate
of
heaven
as
wide
as
you
can
and
get
out
all
the
heavenly
ornaments
and
decorations
for
a
very
deserving
soul
is
going
to
arrive
here
peter
did
as
he
was
told
with
great
joy
and
thought
certainly
my
little
sister
is
dead
and
is
coming
to
heaven
when
everything
was
ready
there
came
the
soul
of
his
big
sister
who
had
died
and
left
many
children
who
bitterly
lamented
her
loss
the
lord
gave
her
an
exalted
place
in
heaven
much
to
the
astonishment
of
peter
who
thought
i
never
should
have
imagined
this
what
shall
i
have
to
do
when
the
soul
of
my
little
sister
comes
not
long
after
the
lord
said
to
him
peter
open
the
gate
of
heaven
a
little
way
but
a
very
little
do
you
hear
peter
did
so
and
wondered
who
is
coming
then
came
the
soul
of
his
little
sister
and
had
so
much
trouble
to
squeeze
through
the
gate
that
she
hurt
herself
and
she
received
a
much
lower
place
in
heaven
than
the
big
sister
at
first
peter
was
amazed
afterwards
he
said
it
has
happened
differently
from
what
i
imagined
but
i
see
now
that
every
profession
has
its
merits
and
every
one
if
he
only
wishes
can
enter
heaven
the
cycle
of
stories
referring
to
our
lord
would
not
be
complete
without
legends
of
pilate
judas
and
the
wandering
jew
a
powerful
story
is
told
of
the
first
in
pitrè
no
which
is
as
follows
lv
pilate
it
is
said
that
the
following
once
took
place
at
rome
a
wagon
loaded
with
stones
was
crossing
a
solitary
spot
in
the
country
when
one
of
the
wheels
sank
into
the
ground
and
it
was
impossible
to
extricate
it
for
some
time
finally
they
got
it
out
but
there
remained
a
large
hole
that
opened
into
a
dark
room
under
ground
who
wishes
to
descend
into
this
hole
i
said
the
carter
they
soon
procured
a
rope
and
lowered
the
carter
into
the
dark
room
we
will
suppose
that
this
carter
name
was
master
francis
well
then
master
francis
when
he
was
let
down
turned
to
the
right
and
saw
a
door
which
he
opened
and
found
himself
in
darkness
that
you
could
cut
he
turned
to
the
left
the
same
he
went
forward
the
same
he
turned
once
more
and
when
he
opened
the
door
what
did
he
see
he
saw
a
man
seated
before
a
table
before
him
pen
ink
and
a
written
paper
that
he
was
reading
and
when
he
finished
it
he
began
over
again
and
never
raised
his
eyes
from
the
paper
master
francis
who
was
of
incomparable
courage
went
up
to
him
and
said
who
are
you
the
man
made
no
answer
but
continued
to
read
who
are
you
said
master
francis
again
but
not
a
word
the
third
time
the
man
said
turn
around
open
your
shirt
and
i
will
write
who
i
am
on
your
back
when
you
leave
this
place
go
to
the
pope
and
make
him
read
who
i
am
remember
however
that
the
pope
alone
must
read
it
master
francis
turned
about
opened
his
shirt
the
man
wrote
on
his
back
and
then
sat
down
again
master
francis
was
courageous
it
is
true
but
he
was
not
made
of
wood
and
in
that
moment
he
was
frightened
to
death
he
fixed
his
shirt
and
then
asked
how
long
have
you
been
here
but
could
get
no
answer
from
him
seeing
that
it
was
time
lost
to
question
him
he
gave
the
signal
to
those
outside
and
was
drawn
up
when
they
saw
him
they
did
not
recognize
him
he
had
grown
entirely
white
and
seemed
like
an
old
man
of
ninety
what
was
it
what
happened
they
all
began
to
say
nothing
nothing
he
replied
take
me
to
the
pope
for
i
must
confess
two
of
those
who
were
present
conducted
him
to
the
pope
when
he
was
with
him
he
related
what
had
happened
and
taking
off
his
shirt
said
to
him
read
your
holiness
his
holiness
read
i
am
pilate
and
as
he
uttered
these
words
the
poor
carter
became
a
statue
and
it
is
said
that
that
man
was
pilate
who
was
condemned
to
stay
in
a
cave
always
reading
the
sentence
that
he
had
pronounced
on
jesus
christ
without
ever
being
able
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
paper
this
is
the
story
of
pilate
who
is
neither
saved
nor
damned
judas
is
believed
to
have
hanged
himself
on
a
which
before
that
time
was
a
tall
beautiful
tree
after
judas
death
it
became
the
diminutive
shapeless
shrub
called
which
is
a
synonym
for
all
that
is
worthless
the
soul
of
the
traitor
is
condemned
to
wander
through
the
air
and
every
time
it
sees
this
shrub
it
pauses
and
imagines
it
sees
its
miserable
body
dangling
from
it
the
prey
of
birds
and
dogs
this
popular
legend
is
told
in
the
following
words
lvi
the
story
of
judas
you
must
know
that
judas
was
the
one
who
betrayed
jesus
christ
now
when
judas
betrayed
him
his
master
said
repent
judas
for
i
pardon
you
but
judas
not
at
all
he
departed
with
his
bag
of
money
in
despair
and
cursing
heaven
and
earth
what
did
he
do
while
he
was
going
along
thus
desperate
he
came
across
a
you
must
know
that
the
tamarind
was
formerly
a
large
tree
like
the
olive
and
walnut
when
he
saw
this
tamarind
a
wild
thought
entered
his
mind
remembering
the
treason
he
had
committed
he
made
a
noose
in
a
rope
and
hung
himself
to
the
tamarind
and
hence
it
is
because
this
traitor
judas
was
cursed
by
god
that
the
dried
up
and
from
that
time
on
it
ceased
growing
up
into
a
tree
and
became
a
short
twisted
and
tangled
bush
and
its
wood
is
good
for
nothing
neither
to
burn
nor
to
make
anything
out
of
and
all
on
account
of
judas
who
hanged
himself
on
it
some
say
that
the
soul
of
judas
went
to
the
lowest
hell
to
suffer
the
most
painful
torments
but
i
have
heard
from
older
persons
who
can
know
that
judas
soul
has
a
severer
sentence
they
say
that
it
is
in
the
air
always
wandering
about
the
world
without
being
able
to
rise
higher
or
fall
lower
and
every
day
on
all
the
tamarind
shrubs
that
it
meets
it
sees
its
body
hanging
and
torn
by
the
dogs
and
birds
of
prey
they
say
that
the
pain
he
suffers
can
not
be
told
and
that
it
makes
the
flesh
creep
to
think
of
it
and
thus
jesus
christ
condemned
him
for
his
great
treason
an
interesting
legend
pitrè
no
is
told
of
the
jew
who
struck
our
lord
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
john
xviii
and
whom
the
popular
imagination
has
identified
with
the
malchus
mentioned
by
john
xviii
it
is
called
lvii
desperate
malchus
this
malchus
was
one
of
those
jews
who
beat
our
lord
a
jew
more
brutal
than
can
be
told
when
christ
was
taken
to
pilate
house
this
malchus
with
an
iron
glove
gave
him
a
blow
so
heavy
that
it
knocked
out
all
his
teeth
for
the
sacrilegious
act
the
lord
condemned
him
to
walk
constantly
without
ever
resting
around
a
column
in
an
underground
room
this
column
is
in
a
round
room
and
malchus
walks
and
walks
without
ever
having
peace
or
rest
they
say
that
he
has
walked
so
much
that
he
has
worn
the
ground
down
many
yards
and
made
the
column
seem
higher
than
it
was
for
this
malchus
has
led
this
life
ever
since
our
lord
passion
and
death
it
is
said
that
this
malchus
is
desperate
from
his
remorse
and
while
he
walks
he
beats
the
column
strikes
his
head
against
the
wall
and
rages
and
laments
but
notwithstanding
he
does
not
die
for
the
sentence
of
god
is
that
he
must
live
until
the
day
of
judgment
the
same
legend
is
found
in
bernoni
as
follows
lviii
malchus
at
the
column
malchus
was
the
head
of
the
jews
who
killed
our
lord
the
lord
pardoned
them
all
and
likewise
the
good
thief
but
he
never
pardoned
malchus
because
it
was
he
who
gave
the
madonna
a
blow
he
is
confined
under
a
mountain
and
condemned
to
walk
around
a
column
without
resting
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
every
time
that
he
walks
about
the
column
he
gives
it
a
blow
in
memory
of
the
blow
he
gave
the
mother
of
our
lord
he
has
walked
around
the
column
so
long
that
he
has
sunk
into
the
ground
he
is
now
up
to
his
neck
when
he
is
under
head
and
all
the
world
will
come
to
an
end
and
god
will
then
send
him
to
the
place
prepared
for
him
he
asks
all
those
who
go
to
see
him
for
there
are
such
whether
children
are
yet
born
and
when
they
say
yes
he
gives
a
deep
sigh
and
resumes
his
walk
saying
the
time
is
not
yet
for
before
the
world
comes
to
an
end
there
will
be
no
children
born
for
seven
years
this
legend
recalls
the
wandering
jew
who
is
known
in
sicilian
tradition
under
the
name
of

thrust
away
and
god
or
more

of
salaparuta
gives
the
following
account
of
her
father
encounter
with

the
story
of

it
was
in
the
winter
and
my
good
father
was
at
scalone
in
the
warehouse
warming
himself
at
the
fire
when
he
saw
a
man
enter

differently
from
the
people
of
that
region
with
breeches
striped
in
yellow
red
and
black
and
his

my

and
while

i
salute
you
farewell
farewell
my
name
is
we
have
only
a
few
legends
of
the
saints
to
mention
undoubtedly
a
large
number
are
current
among
the
people
busk
pp
gives
a
good
many
but
they
do
not
differ
materially
from
the
literary
versions
circulated
by
the
church
those
which
we
shall
cite
are
purely
popular
and
belong
to
the
great
mediæval
the
first
is
the
legend
of
gregory
on
the
stone
which
was
so
popular
in
the
mediæval
epics
there
are
several
italian
versions
but
we
select
as
the
most
complete
the
one
in
gonzenbach
no
called
lx
the
story
of
crivòliu
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
brother
and
sister
who
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
lived
alone
together
they
loved
each
other
so
much
that
they
committed
a
sin
which
they
should
not
have
committed
when
the
time
came
the
sister
gave
birth
to
a
boy
which
the
brother
had
secretly
baptized
then
he
burnt
into
his
shoulders
a
cross
with
these
words
crivòliu
who
is
baptized
son
of
a
brother
and
sister
after
the
child
was
thus
marked
he
put
it
in
a
little
box
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
now
it
happened
that
a
fisherman
had
just
gone
out
to
fish
and
saw
the
box
floating
on
the
waves
a
ship
must
have
sunk
somewhere
he
thought
i
will
get
the
box
perhaps
there
is
something
useful
in
it
so
he
rowed
after
it
and
got
it
when
he
opened
it
and
saw
the
little
child
in
it
he
had
pity
on
the
innocent
child
took
it
home
to
his
wife
and
said
my
dear
wife
our
youngest
child
is
already
old
enough
to
wean
nurse
in
its
place
this
poor
innocent
child
so
his
wife
took
little
crivòliu
and
nursed
him
and
loved
him
as
though
he
were
her
own
child
the
boy
grew
and
thrived
and
became
every
day
larger
and
stronger
the
fisherman
sons
however
were
jealous
because
their
parents
loved
the
little
foundling
as
well
as
them
and
when
they
played
with
crivòliu
and
quarrelled
they
called
him
a
foundling
the
boy
heart
was
saddened
by
this
and
he
went
to
his
and
said
dear
parents
tell
me
am
i
truly
not
your
son
the
fisherman
wife
said
how
should
you
not
be
my
son
have
i
not
nursed
you
when
you
were
a
baby
the
fisherman
forbade
his
children
very
strictly
to
call
little
crivòliu
a
foundling
when
the
child
was
larger
the
fisherman
sent
him
to
school
with
his
sons
the
children
when
they
were
out
of
their
father
hearing
began
again
to
mock
little
crivòliu
and
to
call
him
foundling
and
the
other
children
in
the
school
did
the
same
then
crivòliu
went
again
to
his
and
asked
them
if
he
was
not
their
son
they
persuaded
him
out
of
it
however
and
put
him
off
until
he
was
fourteen
then
he
could
no
longer
stand
being
called
foundling
and
went
to
the
fisherman
and
his
wife
and
said
dear
parents
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
whether
i
am
your
child
or
not
then
the
fisherman
told
him
how
he
had
found
him
and
what
was
written
on
his
shoulders
then
i
will
go
forth
and
do
penance
for
the
sins
of
my
parents
said
crivòliu
the
fisherman
wife
wept
and
lamented
and
would
not
let
him
go
but
crivòliu
would
not
be
detained
and
wandered
out
into
the
wide
world
after
he
had
wandered
about
a
long
time
he
came
one
day
to
a
lonely
place
where
there
was
only
an
inn
he
asked
the
hostess
tell
me
good
woman
is
there
a
cave
near
by
to
which
you
alone
know
the
entrance
she
answered
yes
my
handsome
youth
i
know
such
a
cave
and
will
take
you
to
it
willingly
then
crivòliu
took
two
worth
of
bread
and
a
little
pitcher
of
water
with
him
and
had
the
hostess
show
him
the
cave
it
was
some
distance
from
the
inn
and
the
entrance
was
so
covered
with
thorns
and
bushes
that
he
could
scarcely
penetrate
into
the
cave
he
sent
the
hostess
back
crept
into
the
cave
put
the
bread
and
water
on
the
ground
knelt
with
folded
arms
and
so
did
penance
for
the
sins
of
his
parents
many
many
years
passed
i
know
not
how
many
but
so
many
that
his
knees
took
root
and
he
grew
fast
to
the
ground
now
it
happened
that
the
pope
died
at
rome
and
a
new
one
was
to
be
chosen
the
cardinals
all
assembled
and
a
white
dove
was
let
loose
for
he
on
whom
it
should
alight
was
to
be
pope
the
white
dove
made
several
circles
in
the
air
but
alighted
on
no
one
then
all
the
archbishops
and
bishops
were
summoned
and
the
dove
was
again
let
loose
but
it
did
not
settle
on
any
one
then
all
the
priests
and
monks
and
hermits
were
collected
but
the
white
dove
would
not
choose
any
of
them
the
people
were
in
great
despair
and
the
cardinals
had
to
wander
forth
and
search
the
whole
country
to
see
whether
another
hermit
was
yet
to
be
found
and
a
crowd
of
people
accompanied
them
at
last
they
came
to
the
inn
in
the
lonely
neighborhood
and
asked
the
hostess
whether
she
knew
of
any
hermit
or
penitent
who
was
yet
unknown
to
the
world
the
hostess
answered
many
years
ago
a
sorrowful
youth
came
here
and
made
me
conduct
him
to
a
cave
to
do
penance
he
is
surely
dead
long
ago
for
he
took
with
him
only
two
worth
of
bread
and
a
pitcher
of
water
the
cardinals
said
we
will
look
however
and
see
whether
he
is
still
alive
take
us
to
him
then
the
hostess
conducted
them
to
the
cave
the
entrance
was
scarcely
to
be
recognized
so
overgrown
was
it
with
brambles
and
before
they
could
enter
the
attendants
had
to
cut
away
the
brambles
and
bushes
with
axes
after
they
had
forced
their
way
in
they
saw
crivòliu
kneeling
in
the
cave
with
crossed
arms
and
his
beard
had
grown
so
long
that
it
touched
the
ground
and
before
him
lay
the
bread
and
by
it
the
pitcher
of
water
for
in
all
those
years
he
had
not
eaten
or
drunken
when
they
let
the
white
dove
loose
now
it
flew
about
in
a
circle
for
a
moment
and
then
alighted
on
the
head
of
the
penitent
then
the
cardinals
perceived
that
he
was
a
saint
and
begged
him
to
come
with
them
and
be
their
pope
as
they
were
going
to
raise
him
up
they
noticed
that
his
knees
had
grown
fast
and
they
had
to
cut
the
roots
then
they
took
him
to
rome
with
them
and
he
was
made
pope
now
it
happened
that
at
the
same
time
the
sister
said
to
her
brother
dear
brother
when
we
were
young
we
committed
a
sin
that
we
have
not
yet
confessed
for
the
pope
alone
can
absolve
us
from
it
let
us
go
then
to
rome
before
death
overtakes
us
and
confess
there
our
sin
so
they
started
on
their
journey
to
rome
and
when
they
arrived
there
they
entered
the
church
where
the
pope
sat
in
the
confessional
when
they
had
confessed
in
a
loud
voice
for
one
always
confesses
openly
to
the
pope
the
pope
said
behold
i
am
your
son
for
on
my
shoulder
is
the
mark
you
speak
of
i
have
done
penance
many
years
for
your
sin
until
it
has
been
forgiven
you
i
absolve
you
therefore
from
your
sin
and
you
shall
stay
with
me
and
live
in
comfort
so
they
remained
with
him
and
when
their
time
came
the
lord
called
them
all
three
to
his
kingdom
an
important
episode
of
the
original
legend
is
omitted
in
the
above
version
but
preserved
in
those
in
pitrè
no
and
knust
no
the
youth
after
discovering
his
origin
sets
out
on
his
wanderings
and
comes
by
chance
to
the
country
where
his
mother
is
living
they
meet
and
not
knowing
their
relation
marry
in
the
sicilian
story
this
relationship
is
disclosed
the
day
of
the
marriage
by
the
son
showing
his
mother
the
box
in
which
he
was
exposed
as
a
child
in
the
version
of
knust
from
leghorn
the
child
leaves
his
and
goes
in
search
of
his
parents
he
encounters
them
without
knowing
it
of
course
and
they
supposing
him
to
be
a
beggar
boy
give
him
shelter
and
care
for
him
until
he
has
grown
up
then
he
marries
his
mother
who
recognizes
him
by
a
lock
of
red
hair
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
after
the
pope
has
heard
the
confession
of
his
parents
he
reveals
himself
they
all
three
embrace
and
die
thus
united
the
story
adds
their
tomb
is
still
preserved
in
peter
at
rome
another
pope
silvester
i
is
the
subject
of
a
legend
in
pitrè
no
which
contains
the
myth
of
constantine
leprosy
healed
by
his
baptism
at
the
hands
of
silvester
of
greater
interest
is
a
legend
of
james
the
elder
the
of
spain
a
pilgrimage
to
whose
shrine
at
santiago
in
galicia
was
so
popular
during
the
middle
ages
the
only
popular
version
which
we
have
found
is
in
a
sicilian
story
in
gonzenbach
no
lxi
the
story
of
james
of
galicia
there
was
once
a
king
and
queen
who
had
no
children
and
who
longed
to
have
a
son
or
daughter
the
queen
prayed
to
james
of
galicia
and
said
o
james
if
you
will
grant
me
a
son
he
shall
make
a
pilgrimage
to
your
shrine
when
he
is
eighteen
years
old
after
a
time
the
queen
had
through
the
favor
of
god
and
the
saint
a
beautiful
boy
who
was
as
handsome
as
if
god
had
made
him
the
child
grew
rapidly
and
became
larger
and
fairer
every
day
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
the
king
died
and
the
queen
remained
alone
with
this
son
whom
she
loved
as
dearly
as
her
eyes
many
years
passed
and
the
time
drew
near
when
the
prince
should
be
eighteen
when
the
queen
thought
that
she
must
soon
part
from
him
to
send
him
alone
on
the
long
pilgrimage
she
became
very
sorrowful
and
wept
and
sighed
the
whole
day
one
day
the
prince
said
to
her
mother
why
do
you
sigh
all
day
it
is
nothing
my
son
only
some
cares
of
mine
she
answered
what
are
you
concerned
about
asked
he
are
you
afraid
that
your
farms
in
the
plain
of
catania
are
badly
tilled
let
me
go
and
look
after
them
and
bring
you
news
of
them
the
queen
consented
and
the
prince
rode
to
the
plain
to
the
property
that
belonged
to
them
he
found
everything
in
good
order
and
returned
to
his
mother
and
said
dear
mother
rejoice
and
cease
your
care
for
everything
is
going
well
on
your
property
the
cattle
are
thriving
the
fields
are
tilled
and
the
grain
will
soon
be
ripe
very
well
my
son
answered
the
queen
but
she
was
not
cheerful
and
the
next
day
began
to
sigh
and
weep
again
then
the
prince
said
to
her
dear
mother
if
you
do
not
tell
me
why
you
are
so
sad
i
will
depart
and
wander
out
in
the
wide
world
the
queen
answered
ah
my
dear
son
i
am
sad
because
you
must
now
part
from
me
for
before
you
were
born
when
i
longed
for
you
so
much
i
vowed
to
james
of
galicia
that
if
he
would
grant
you
to
me
you
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
his
shrine
when
you
were
eighteen
years
old
and
now
you
will
soon
be
eighteen
and
i
am
sad
because
you
must
wander
away
alone
and
be
gone
so
many
years
for
to
reach
the
saint
one
must
journey
a
whole
year
is
it
nothing
but
that
dear
mother
asked
her
son
be
not
so
sorrowful
only
the
dead
return
not
if
i
live
i
will
soon
come
back
to
you
so
he
comforted
his
mother
and
when
he
was
eighteen
he
took
leave
of
the
queen
and
said
now
farewell
dear
mother
and
god
willing
we
shall
meet
again
the
queen
wept
bitterly
and
embraced
him
with
many
tears
then
she
gave
him
three
apples
and
said
my
son
take
these
three
apples
and
give
heed
to
my
words
you
shall
not
make
the
long
journey
alone
when
however
a
youth
joins
you
and
wishes
to
accompany
you
take
him
with
you
to
the
inn
and
let
him
eat
with
you
after
the
meal
cut
an
apple
in
two
halves
one
large
and
the
other
small
and
offer
them
to
the
young
man
if
he
takes
the
larger
half
part
from
him
for
he
will
be
no
true
friend
to
you
but
if
he
takes
the
smaller
half
regard
him
as
your
brother
and
share
everything
that
you
have
with
him
after
these
words
she
embraced
her
son
and
blessed
him
and
the
prince
departed
he
had
already
travelled
a
long
time
and
no
one
had
met
him
one
day
however
he
saw
a
youth
coming
along
the
road
who
joined
him
and
asked
where
are
you
going
handsome
youth
i
am
making
a
pilgrimage
to
james
of
galicia
and
he
told
him
of
his
mother
vow
i
must
go
there
too
said
the
other
for
the
same
thing
happened
to
my
mother
as
to
yours
if
we
have
the
same
journey
to
make
we
can
make
it
together
they
continued
their
journey
together
but
the
prince
was
not
confidential
towards
his
companion
for
he
thought
i
must
first
make
the
trial
with
the
apple
as
they
were
passing
an
inn
the
prince
said
i
am
hungry
shall
we
not
have
something
to
eat
the
other
was
willing
so
they
went
in
and
ate
together
after
they
had
eaten
the
prince
took
out
the
apple
cut
it
in
two
unequal
halves
and
offered
them
to
the
other
who
took
the
larger
half
you
are
no
true
friend
thought
the
prince
and
to
get
rid
of
him
he
pretended
to
be
ill
and
obliged
to
remain
there
the
other
said
i
can
not
wait
for
you
for
i
have
far
to
go
yet
so
farewell
farewell
said
the
prince
and
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
when
he
continued
his
journey
again
he
thought
ah
if
god
would
only
send
me
a
true
friend
so
that
i
should
not
have
to
travel
alone
not
long
after
another
youth
joined
him
and
asked
handsome
young
man
where
are
you
going
the
prince
answered
him
as
he
had
done
before
and
everything
happened
the
same
as
with
the
first
young
man
after
the
prince
had
got
rid
of
him
he
resumed
his
journey
and
thought
o
god
let
me
find
a
true
friend
who
shall
be
to
me
a
brother
on
the
long
journey
while
he
was
uttering
this
prayer
he
saw
a
youth
coming
along
the
way
who
was
a
handsome
lad
and
appeared
so
friendly
that
he
liked
him
at
once
and
thought
ah
may
this
be
the
true
friend
the
youth
joined
him
and
everything
passed
as
before
except
that
this
time
the
youth
took
the
smaller
half
of
the
apple
and
the
prince
rejoiced
that
he
had
found
a
true
friend
fair
youth
said
he
to
him
we
must
consider
ourselves
as
brothers
now
what
is
mine
shall
be
yours
also
and
what
is
yours
shall
be
mine
we
will
travel
together
until
we
come
to
the
shrine
of
the
saint
and
if
one
of
us
dies
on
the
way
the
other
must
carry
his
body
there
we
will
both
promise
this
they
did
so
and
regarded
each
other
as
brothers
and
continued
their
journey
together
to
reach
the
shrine
of
the
saint
requires
a
whole
year
imagine
then
how
long
the
two
must
travel
one
day
when
they
came
weary
and
exhausted
to
a
large
beautiful
city
they
said
we
will
stay
here
and
rest
a
few
days
and
afterwards
continue
our
journey
so
they
took
a
small
house
and
dwelt
in
it
now
opposite
it
was
the
royal
palace
and
one
morning
as
the
king
was
standing
on
the
balcony
he
saw
the
two
handsome
youths
and
thought
oh
how
handsome
these
two
youths
are
one
is
however
much
handsomer
than
the
other
i
will
give
him
my
daughter
in
marriage
now
the
prince
was
the
handsomer
of
the
two
in
order
to
attain
his
aim
the
king
invited
them
both
to
dinner
and
when
they
came
to
the
palace
received
them
in
a
very
friendly
manner
and
had
his
daughter
called
who
was
more
beautiful
than
the
sun
and
moon
when
they
retired
for
the
night
the
king
had
a
poisonous
drink
given
to
the
prince
companion
who
fell
down
dead
for
the
king
thought
if
his
friend
dies
the
other
will
remain
here
willingly
and
think
no
more
of
his
pilgrimage
but
marry
my
daughter
the
next
morning
when
the
prince
awoke
he
asked
where
is
my
friend
he
died
suddenly
last
night
and
is
to
be
buried
at
once
answered
the
servants
the
prince
said
if
my
friend
is
dead
i
can
not
remain
here
longer
but
must
depart
this
very
hour
ah
do
remain
here
begged
the
king
i
will
give
you
my
daughter
for
your
wife
no
said
the
prince
i
can
not
stay
here
if
you
will
grant
me
a
wish
give
me
a
horse
and
let
me
depart
in
peace
and
when
i
have
completed
my
pilgrimage
i
will
return
and
marry
your
daughter
the
king
then
gave
him
a
horse
which
the
prince
mounted
and
took
his
dead
friend
before
him
on
the
saddle
and
thus
completed
his
journey
the
young
man
however
was
not
dead
but
lay
only
in
a
deep
sleep
when
the
prince
reached
the
shrine
of
james
of
galicia
he
dismounted
took
his
friend
in
his
arms
like
a
child
and
entered
the
church
and
laid
the
body
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
before
the
saint
and
prayed
o
james
of
galicia
behold
i
have
kept
my
vow
i
have
come
to
you
and
have
brought
you
my
friend
also
i
confide
him
now
to
you
if
you
will
restore
him
to
life
we
will
laud
your
mercy
but
if
he
is
not
to
come
to
life
again
he
has
at
least
kept
his
vow
and
behold
while
he
was
still
praying
his
dead
friend
rose
and
became
again
alive
and
well
both
thanked
the
saint
and
gave
him
costly
presents
and
then
started
on
their
journey
home
when
they
reached
the
city
where
the
king
lived
they
occupied
again
the
little
house
opposite
the
royal
palace
the
king
was
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
the
handsome
prince
there
again
and
much
handsomer
than
before
he
arranged
great
festivities
and
had
a
splendid
marriage
celebrated
and
thus
the
prince
married
the
fair
princess
after
the
wedding
they
remained
several
months
with
her
father
and
then
the
prince
said
my
mother
is
expecting
me
at
home
with
great
anxiety
therefore
i
can
not
stay
longer
here
but
will
return
to
my
mother
with
my
wife
and
my
friend
the
king
consented
and
they
prepared
for
the
journey
now
the
king
had
a
deadly
hatred
against
the
poor
innocent
youth
to
whom
he
had
before
given
the
fatal
drink
and
who
had
nevertheless
returned
alive
and
in
order
to
cause
him
sorrow
he
sent
him
in
great
haste
on
the
morning
of
the
departure
into
the
country
with
an
errand
hasten
he
said
your
friend
will
not
start
until
you
return
the
youth
hastened
away
without
taking
leave
and
performed
the
errand
the
king
meanwhile
said
to
the
prince
hasten
your
departure
otherwise
you
can
not
reach
your
quarters
for
the
night
before
evening
i
can
not
depart
without
my
friend
answered
the
prince
the
king
however
said
set
out
on
your
journey
he
will
be
here
within
an
hour
and
will
soon
overtake
you
on
his
swift
horse
the
prince
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
took
leave
of
his
and
departed
with
his
wife
the
poor
friend
could
not
fulfil
the
king
commission
before
several
hours
and
when
he
finally
returned
the
king
said
to
him
your
friend
is
already
far
from
here
see
how
you
can
overtake
him
so
the
poor
youth
had
to
leave
the
palace
and
did
not
even
receive
a
horse
and
began
to
run
and
ran
day
and
night
until
he
overtook
the
prince
from
his
great
exertions
however
he
contracted
leprosy
so
that
he
looked
ill
wretched
and
dreadful
the
prince
nevertheless
received
him
in
a
friendly
manner
and
cared
for
him
like
a
brother
they
finally
reached
home
where
the
queen
had
awaited
her
son
with
great
anxiety
and
now
embraced
him
with
perfect
joy
the
prince
had
a
bed
prepared
at
once
for
his
sick
friend
and
summoned
all
the
physicians
of
the
town
and
state
but
no
one
could
help
him
when
the
poor
youth
grew
no
better
the
prince
addressed
himself
to
james
of
galicia
and
said
o
james
of
galicia
you
raised
my
friend
from
the
dead
help
him
now
this
time
also
and
let
him
recover
from
his
leprosy
while
he
was
praying
a
servant
entered
and
said
a
strange
physician
is
without
who
will
make
the
poor
youth
well
again
this
physician
was
james
of
galicia
himself
who
had
heard
the
prayer
of
the
prince
and
had
come
to
help
his
friend
you
must
know
now
that
the
prince
wife
had
had
a
little
girl
who
was
a
pretty
lovely
child
when
the
saint
approached
the
bed
of
the
sick
youth
he
first
examined
him
and
then
said
to
the
prince
do
you
really
wish
to
see
your
friend
well
again
at
any
price
at
any
price
answered
the
prince
only
tell
me
what
can
help
him
this
evening
take
your
child
said
the
saint
open
all
her
veins
and
anoint
with
her
blood
your
wounds
and
he
will
be
healed
at
once
the
prince
was
horrified
when
he
heard
that
he
himself
must
kill
his
dear
little
daughter
but
he
answered
i
have
promised
my
friend
to
treat
him
like
my
brother
and
if
there
is
no
other
remedy
i
will
sacrifice
my
child
at
evening
he
took
the
child
and
opened
her
veins
and
anointed
with
the
blood
the
sores
of
the
sick
youth
who
was
at
once
cleansed
from
his
foul
leprosy
the
child
became
pale
and
weak
and
looked
as
if
it
were
dead
then
they
laid
it
in
its
cradle
and
the
poor
parents
were
deeply
grieved
for
they
believed
they
had
lost
their
child
the
next
morning
the
physician
came
and
asked
after
the
patient
he
is
well
and
sound
answered
the
prince
and
where
have
you
put
your
child
asked
the
saint
there
it
lies
dead
in
its
cradle
said
the
poor
father
sadly
just
look
at
her
once
and
see
how
she
is
said
the
saint
and
when
they
hastened
to
the
cradle
they
saw
the
child
in
it
alive
and
well
again
then
the
saint
said
i
am
james
of
galicia
and
have
come
to
help
you
because
i
have
seen
what
true
friendship
you
have
displayed
continue
to
love
one
another
and
when
you
are
in
trouble
turn
to
me
and
i
will
come
to
your
aid
with
these
words
he
blessed
them
and
disappeared
from
their
sight
they
lived
piously
and
did
much
good
to
the
poor
and
were
happy
and
contented
there
are
several
interesting
legends
found
only
in
collection
they
can
be
mentioned
but
briefly
here
the
first
no
is
entitled
the
story
of
onirià
or
nerià
two
huntsmen
lost
their
way
in
a
wood
and
found
at
night
a
hut
in
which
was
a
table
set
for
supper
and
a
fire
which
emitted
a
heavenly
odor
they
examined
it
and
found
in
the
coals
a
heart
which
they
took
with
them
when
they
departed
the
next
morning
after
they
had
travelled
a
while
they
stopped
at
an
inn
and
the
pious
and
virtuous
daughter
of
the
innkeeper
waited
on
them
and
noticed
the
odor
which
came
from
the
jacket
that
one
of
the
huntsmen
had
laid
aside
on
account
of
the
heat
in
the
pocket
she
found
the
heart
which
she
kept
for
a
time
on
a
table
in
her
room
one
day
she
was
seized
with
a
great
longing
to
eat
it
she
did
so
and
it
soon
was
evident
that
she
was
about
to
become
a
mother
her
father
treated
her
cruelly
for
the
shame
she
was
going
to
bring
on
the
family
but
her
godmother
interfered
and
one
night
had
a
strange
dream
there
appeared
to
her
a
saint
who
said
i
am
onirià
and
was
consumed
by
fire
only
my
heart
was
left
so
that
i
might
be
born
again
this
heart
the
host
daughter
has
eaten
and
she
will
in
due
time
give
birth
to
me
the
child
was
born
as
predicted
and
grew
handsomer
every
day
the
grandfather
however
could
not
endure
him
and
him
as
well
as
his
mother
one
day
when
the
child
was
five
years
old
the
grandfather
took
him
to
the
city
on
the
way
they
passed
a
place
where
there
was
much
filth
and
the
child
said
to
his
grandfather
i
wish
you
might
wallow
in
it
afterwards
they
saw
a
poor
man
being
carried
to
the
grave
on
a
ladder
without
any
coffin
the
child
here
wished
that
his
grandfather
when
he
died
might
be
like
this
one
next
they
met
the
long
funeral
procession
of
a
rich
man
and
the
child
wished
that
his
grandfather
might
not
be
like
this
rich
man
the
grandfather
of
course
in
each
case
was
very
angry
and
was
only
restrained
from
beating
the
child
by
the
godfather
who
had
accompanied
them
after
they
had
finished
their
business
in
the
city
they
set
out
for
home
and
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
they
had
met
the
rich
funeral
procession
the
child
made
his
grandfather
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
when
he
heard
a
great
noise
as
if
of
iron
pestles
and
lamentations
the
child
explained
that
what
he
heard
were
the
devils
tormenting
the
rich
man
soul
when
they
came
where
they
had
seen
the
poor
man
on
the
ladder
the
grandfather
listened
again
and
heard
the
rejoicings
of
the
angels
on
receiving
the
poor
man
soul
when
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
filth
was
the
child
made
his
grandfather
dig
and
find
a
pot
of
money
which
he
told
him
to
use
better
than
he
had
done
his
own
the
child
then
said
he
was
onirià
exculpated
his
mother
and
said
his
grandfather
would
see
him
again
when
the
dead
spoke
with
the
living
then
he
was
taken
up
into
heaven
years
after
two
men
spent
the
night
in
the
inn
and
one
murdered
the
other
and
hid
the
body
under
the
straw
where
it
was
afterwards
found
by
other
travellers
and
the
innkeeper
accused
of
the
murder
he
was
condemned
and
was
on
the
scaffold
when
a
beautiful
youth
came
riding
in
hot
haste
crying
pardon
the
youth
led
the
people
into
the
church
before
the
coffin
of
the
murdered
man
and
cried
rise
dead
one
and
speak
with
the
living
and
tell
us
who
murdered
you
the
dead
man
replied
the
innkeeper
is
innocent
my
treacherous
companion
killed
me
then
the
youth
accompanied
the
innkeeper
home
revealed
himself
as
onirià
blessed
them
and
disappeared
another
legend
no
the
story
of
the
hermit
has
as
its
subject
the
mystery
of
god
providence
and
is
familiar
to
english
readers
in
the
form
of
parnell
hermit
the
substance
of
the
sicilian
version
is
as
follows
a
hermit
sees
a
man
wrongfully
accused
of
theft
and
shockingly
maltreated
he
thereupon
concludes
that
god
is
unjust
to
suffer
such
things
and
determines
to
return
to
the
world
on
his
way
back
a
handsome
youth
meets
him
and
they
journey
together
a
muleteer
allows
them
to
ride
his
beasts
and
in
return
the
youth
abstracts
the
muleteer
money
from
his
wallet
and
drops
it
in
the
road
a
woman
who
keeps
an
inn
receives
them
hospitably
and
on
leaving
the
next
morning
the
youth
strangles
her
child
in
the
cradle
all
at
once
the
youth
becomes
a
shining
angel
and
says
to
the
hermit
listen
to
me
o
man
who
has
been
bold
enough
to
murmur
against
god
decrees
and
then
explains
that
the
person
who
had
been
wrongfully
accused
of
theft
had
years
before
murdered
his
father
on
that
very
spot
the
muleteer
money
was
stolen
money
and
the
child
of
the
hostess
had
it
lived
would
have
become
a
robber
and
murderer
then
the
angel
says
now
you
see
that
god
justice
is
more
than
man
return
then
to
your
hermitage
and
repent
if
so
be
that
your
murmuring
be
forgiven
you
the
angel
disappears
and
the
hermit
returns
to
his
mountain
does
severer
penance
and
dies
a
saint
the
legend
in
gonzenbach
no
entitled
joseph
the
just
is
nothing
but
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
taken
from
the
bible
in
the
sicilian
version
joseph
has
only
three
brothers
otherwise
the
story
follows
the
account
in
genesis
very
closely
another
legend
in
the
same
collection
no
the
story
of
tobià
and
tobiòla
is
the
story
of
tobit
and
tobias
taken
from
the
apocryphal
book
of
tobit
the
sicilian
story
differs
in
the
names
only
there
are
several
other
sicilian
legends
the
heroes
of
which
are
pious
simple
youths
the
religious
counterparts
of
giufà
one
pitrè
no
called
the
poor
boy
tells
the
story
of
a
simple
youth
who
asked
the
priest
the
way
to
paradise
and
was
told
he
must
follow
the
strait
and
narrow
way
he
took
the
first
one
he
came
to
and
reached
a
convent
church
during
a
festival
and
imagined
he
had
reached
paradise
he
was
found
in
the
church
when
all
had
departed
but
he
persisted
in
remaining
and
the
superior
sent
him
a
bowl
of
soup
which
he
put
on
the
altar
and
when
he
was
alone
he
began
to
converse
confidentially
with
the
lord
on
the
crucifix
and
said
lord
who
put
you
on
the
cross
your
sins
and
so
the
lord
responded
to
all
his
questions
the
youth
in
tears
promised
he
would
sin
no
more
and
invited
the
lord
to
descend
and
partake
of
his
repast
with
him
the
lord
did
so
and
commanded
him
to
tell
the
monks
in
the
convent
that
they
would
be
damned
unless
they
sold
all
their
property
and
bestowed
it
on
the
poor
if
they
would
do
so
and
come
and
confess
to
the
lord
himself
he
would
hear
their
confession
and
give
them
the
communion
and
when
it
was
finished
they
would
all
die
one
after
the
other
and
enter
the
glory
of
paradise
the
poor
youth
went
to
the
superior
and
gave
him
the
lord
message
the
superior
sold
the
property
of
the
convent
and
everything
turned
out
as
the
lord
had
said
the
monks
all
confessed
and
died
and
all
who
were
present
or
heard
of
the
event
were
converted
and
died
in
the
grace
of
god
this
legend
leads
quite
naturally
to
another
in
which
intercourse
with
the
other
world
is
represented
as
still
occasionally
permitted
to
mortals
it
is
found
only
in
sicily
having
curiously
enough
parallels
in
the
rest
of
europe
but
none
in
italy
it
is
called

the
baker
apprentice
there
was
once
a
baker
who
every
morning
loaded
an
ounceworth
of
bread
on
a
horse
that
came
to
his
shop
one
day
he
said
i
give
this
ounceworth
of
bread
to
this
horse
and
he
renders
me
no
account
of
it
then
he
said
to
his
apprentice
vincenzo
the
horse
will
come
and
i
will
give
him
the
bread
but
you
must
follow
him
and
see
where
he
goes
the
next
day
the
horse
came
and
the
baker
loaded
him
and
gave
the
apprentice
a
piece
of
bread
for
himself
vincenzo
followed
the
horse
and
after
a
while
came
to
a
river
of
milk
and
began
to
eat
bread
and
milk
and
could
not
overtake
the
horse
again
he
then
returned
to
his
master
who
seeing
him
return
to
no
purpose
said
the
horse
will
come
again
if
you
can
not
tell
me
where
he
goes
i
will
no
longer
have
you
for
my
apprentice
the
next
day
the
apprentice
followed
the
horse
again
and
came
to
a
river
of
wine
and
began
to
eat
bread
and
wine
and
lost
sight
of
the
horse
he
returned
to
his
master
in
despair
at
having
lost
the
horse
his
master
said
listen
the
first
time
one
pardons
the
second
time
one
condones
the
third
time
one
beats
if
you
do
not
follow
the
horse
i
will
give
you
a
good
thrashing
and
send
you
home
what
did
poor
vincenzo
do
he
followed
the
horse
the
next
day
with
his
eyes
open
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
river
of
oil
what
shall
i
do
the
horse
will
get
away
from
me
now
so
he
tied
the
horse
reins
to
his
girdle
and
began
to
eat
bread
and
oil
the
horse
pulled
but
vincenzo
said
when
i
finish
the
bread
i
will
come
when
he
had
finished
the
bread
he
followed
the
horse
and
after
a
time
he
came
to
a
where
the
grass
was
long
and
thick
and
the
cattle
so
thin
that
they
could
scarcely
stand
on
their
feet
vincenzo
was
astonished
at
seeing
the
grass
so
long
and
the
cattle
so
lean
then
he
came
to
another
farm
and
saw
that
the
grass
was
dry
and
short
and
the
cattle
fatter
than
you
can
believe
he
said
to
himself
just
see
there
where
the
grass
was
long
the
cattle
were
lean
here
where
you
can
hardly
see
the
grass
the
cattle
are
so
fat
the
horse
kept
on
and
vincenzo
after
him
after
a
while
he
met
a
sow
with
her
tail
full
of
large
knots
and
wondered
why
she
had
such
a
tail
farther
on
he
came
to
a
where
there
was
a
toad
trying
to
reach
a
crumb
of
bread
and
could
not
vincenzo
continued
his
way
and
arrived
at
a
large
gate
the
horse
knocked
at
the
gate
with
his
head
and
the
door
opened
and
a
beautiful
lady
appeared
who
said
she
was
the
madonna
when
she
saw
the
youth
she
asked
and
what
are
you
here
for
vincenzo
replied
this
horse
comes
constantly
to
my
master
to
get
an
ounceworth
of
bread
and
my
master
never
has
been
able
to
find
out
where
he
carries
it
very
well
enter
said
the
lady
i
will
show
you
where
he
carries
it
then
the
lady
began
to
call
all
the
souls
in
purgatory
my
children
come
hither
the
souls
then
descended
and
to
some
she
gave
the
worth
of
a
of
bread
to
some
the
worth
of
a
and
to
others
the
worth
of
five
and
the
bread
was
gone
in
a
moment
when
the
bread
had
disappeared
the
lady
said
to
vincenzo
did
you
see
nothing
on
your
way

the
first
day
that
my
master
sent
me
to

saw
a
river
of
milk
the
lady
said
that

the
milk
i
gave
my
son
the
second
day
i
saw
a
river
of
wine
that
said
the
lady

the
wine
with
which
my
son
was
consecrated
the
third
day
i
saw
a
river
of
oil
that
is
the
oil
that
they
ask
of
me
and
of
my
son
what

did
you

the
third
day
i
saw

vincenzo
a
farm
with

plenty
of
grass
but
the
cattle
were
lean
afterwards
i

another
farm
where
you
could
scarcely

the
grass
and
the
cattle
were
fine
and
fat
these
my
son
are
the
rich
who
are
in
the
midst
of
wealth
and
no
matter
how
much
they
eat
it
does
no
good
and
the
fat
ones
that

no
grass
to
eat
are
the
poor
for
my
son
supports
and
fattens
them
what
else
did
you
see
i
saw
a
sow
with
her
tail
full
of
knots
that
my
son
is
those
who
repeat
their
rosaries
and
do
not
offer
their
prayers
to
me
or
to
my
son
and
my
son
makes
knots
in
them
i
also
saw
a
with
a
toad
that
was
reaching
after
a
crumb
of
bread
and

not
get
it
she
said
a
poor
person
asked
a
woman
for
a
bit
of
bread
and
she
gave
his
hand

a
blow
that
she
made
him
drop
it
and
what
else
did
you
see
my
son
nothing
lady
then
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
something
else
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
hell
when
the
poor
youth
heard
the
clanking
of
chains
and
saw
the
darkness
he
came
near
dying
and
wanted
to
get
out
you
see
said
the
lady
those
who
are
lamenting
and
in
chains
and
darkness
are
those
who
are
in
mortal
sin
now
come
and
i
will
take
you
to
purgatory
there
they
heard
nothing
and
the
darkness
was
so
great
that
they
could
see
nothing
vincenzo
wished
to
depart
for
he
felt
oppressed
by
anguish
now
said
the
lady
i
will
take
you
to
the
church
of
the
holy
fathers
do
you
see
it
my
son
this
is
the
church
of
the
holy
fathers
which
first
was
full
and
now

empty
come
now
i
will
take
you
to
limbo
do
you
see
these
little
ones
these
are
those
who
died
unbaptized
the
lady
wished
to
show
him
paradise
but
he
was
too
confused
so
the
lady
made
him
look
through
a
window
do
you
see
this
great
palace
there
are
three
seats
there
one
for
you
one
for
your
master
and
one
for
your
mistress
after
this
she
took
him
to
the
gate
the
horse
was
no
longer
there
now
said
vincenzo
how
shall
i
find
my
way
back
i
will
follow
the
tracks
of
the
horse
and
so
will
get
home
the
lady
answered
close
your
eyes
vincenzo
closed
his
eyes
and
found
himself
behind
his
master
door
when
he
entered
he
told
all
that
had
occurred
to
his
master
and
mistress
when
he
had
finished
his
story
all
three
died
and
went
to
paradise
the
most
famous
story
of
the
class
we
are
now
considering
is
however
the
one
best
known
by
its
french
title
the
french
version
was
popular
as
a
as
early
as
running
through
fifteen
editions
from
that
date
the
editor
of
the
reprint
referred
to
in
the
note
as
well
as
grimm
ii
believed
the
story
to
be
of
italian
origin
and
that
the
original
would
some
day
be
discovered
this
has
proved
to
be
the
case
and
we
have
now
before
us
a
number
of
versions
these
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
one
independent
the
other
constituting
a
part
only
of
some
other
story
the
latter
class
is
generally
connected
with
the
cycle
of
our
lord
journeys
upon
earth
and
is
represented
by
the
master
thief
and
brother
lustig
in
germany
and
beppo
pipetta
from
venice
the
sicilian
versions
which
we
shall
mention
first
although
independent
stories
are
connected
with
the
cycle
of
our
lord
journeys
upon
earth
we
give
first
two
versions
from
pitrè
nos
lxiii
occasion
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
father
and
a
mother
who
had
a
little
boy
they
died
and
the
child
was
left
in
the
street
one
of
the
neighbors
had
pity
upon
him
and
took
him
in
the
boy
throve
well
and
when
he
had
grown
up
the
one
who
had
sheltered
him
said
come
now
occasion
for
this
was
the
boy
name
you
are
a
man
why
do
you
not
think
about
supporting
yourself
and
relieving
us
from
that
care
so
the
lad
made
up
a
bundle
and
departed
he
journeyed
and
journeyed
until
his
clothes
were
worn
out
and
he
was
almost
dead
from
hunger
one
day
he
saw
an
inn
and
entered
it
and
said
to
the
innkeeper
do
you
want
me
for
a
servant
i
wish
only
a
piece
of
bread
for
my
wages
the
host
said
to
his
wife
what
do
you
say
rosella
we
have
no
children
shall
we
take
this
lad
yes
and
so
they
took
him
the
boy
was
very
attentive
and
did
willingly
whatever
was
commanded
him
and
at
last
his
master
and
mistress
who
had
grown
to
love
him
like
a
son
went
before
the
judge
and
adopted
him
time
passed
and
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
died
and
left
all
their
property
to
the
young
man
who
when
he
saw
himself
in
possession
of
it
made
known
that
whoever
should
come
to
occasion
inn
could
have
food
for
nothing
you
can
imagine
the
people
that
went
there
now
the
master
and
his
apostles
happened
once
to
pass
that
way
and
when
thomas
read
this
announcement
he
said
unless
i
see
and
touch
with
my
hands
i
shall
not
believe
it
let
us
go
to
this
inn
they
went
there
and
ate
and
drank
and
occasion
treated
them
like
gentlemen
before
leaving
thomas
said
occasion
why
do
you
ask
a
favor
of
the
master
then
occasion
said
master
i
have
before
my
door
this
and
the
children
do
not
let
me
eat
one
of
the
figs
whoever
goes
by
climbs
up
and
pulls
off
some
now
i
would
like
this
favor
that
when
any
one
climbs
this
tree
he
must
stay
there
until
i
permit
him
to
come
down
your
request
is
granted
said
the
lord
and
blessed
the
tree
it
was
a
fine
thing
the
first
who
climbed
up
for
figs
stuck
fast
to
the
tree
without
being
able
to
move
another
came
the
same
thing
and
so
on
all
stuck
fast
one
by
the
hand
another
by
the
foot
another
by
the
head
when
occasion
saw
them
he
gave
them
a
sound
scolding
and
let
them
go
the
children
were
frightened
and
touched
the
figs
no
more
years
passed
and
occasion
money
was
coming
to
an
end
so
he
called
a
carpenter
and
told
him
to
cut
up
the
and
make
him
a
bottle
out
of
it
this
bottle
had
the
property
that
occasion
could
shut
up
in
it
whoever
he
wished
one
day
death
went
to
fetch
him
for
occasion
was
now
very
old
occasion
said
at
your
service
we
will
go
but
see
here
death
first
do
me
a
favor
i
have
this
bottle
of
wine
and
there
is
a
fly
in
it
and
i
do
like
to
drink
from
it
just
go
in
there
and
take
it
out
for
me
and
then
we
will
go
death
very
foolishly
entered
the
bottle
when
occasion
corked
it
and
put
it
in
his
wallet
saying
stay
a
bit
with
me
while
death
was
shut
up
no
one
died
and
everywhere
you
might
see
old
men
with
such
long
white
beards
that
it
was
a
sight
the
apostles
seeing
this
went
to
the
master
about
it
several
times
and
at
last
he
visited
occasion
what
is
this
here
you
have
kept
death
shut
up
so
many
years
and
the
people
are
falling
down
from
old
age
without
dying
master
said
occasion
do
you
want
me
to
let
death
out
if
you
will
give
me
a
place
in
paradise
i
will
let
him
out
the
lord
thought
what
shall
i
do
if
i
do
grant
him
this
favor
he
will
not
leave
me
in
peace
so
he
said
your
request
is
granted
at
these
words
death
was
set
at
liberty
occasion
was
permitted
to
live
a
few
years
longer
and
then
death
took
him
hence
it
is
that
there
is
no
death
without
occasion
lxiv
brother
giovannone
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
convent
at
casteltermini
which
contained
many
monks
one
of
whom
was
named
brother
giovannone
at
the
time
when
the
lord
and
all
his
apostles
were
on
their
travels
they
visited
this
convent
and
all
the
monks
asked
the
lord
to
pardon
their
souls
brother
giovannone
asked
nothing
peter
said
to
him
why
do
you
not
ask
pardon
for
your
soul
like
the
others
i
do
wish
anything
peter
said
nothing
when
you
come
to
paradise
we
will
talk
about
it
when
the
master
had
taken
his
departure
and
had
gone
some
distance
brother
giovannone
began
to
cry
out
master
master
wait
i
want
a
favor
and
it
is
that
any
one
i
command
must
get
into
my
pouch
the
master
said
this
request
is
granted
brother
giovannone
was
old
and
one
day
death
came
and
said
to
him
giovannone
you
have
three
hours
to
live
brother
giovannone
replied
when
you
come
for
me
you
must
let
me
know
half
an
hour
before
after
a
while
death
came
and
said
you
are
a
dead
man
brother
giovannone
replied
in
the
name
of
brother
giovannone
into
my
pouch
with
you
death
then
he
carried
his
pouch
to
a
baker
and
asked
him
to
hang
it
up
in
the
chimney
until
he
came
for
it
for
forty
years
no
one
died
at
the
end
of
that
time
brother
giovannone
went
and
set
death
free
so
that
he
might
himself
die
for
he
was
so
old
he
could
do
no
more
the
first
one
that
death
killed
when
he
was
free
was
brother
giovannone
and
then
he
destroyed
all
those
who
had
not
died
in
the
forty
years
after
he
was
dead
brother
giovannone
went
and
knocked
at
the
gate
of
paradise
and
peter
said
to
him
there
is
no
room
for
you
here
where
must
i
go
then
asked
brother
giovannone
to
purgatory
answered
peter
so
he
knocked
at
purgatory
and
they
told
him
there
is
no
place
for
you
here
where
must
i
go
then
to
hell
he
knocked
at
hell
and
lucifer
asked
who
is
there
brother
giovannone
then
lucifer
said
to
his
devils
you
take
the
mace
you
the
hammer
you
the
tongs
brother
giovannone
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
these
instruments
we
are
going
to
beat
you
in
the
name
of
brother
giovannone
into
my
pouch
with
you
all
you
devils
then
he
hung
the
pouch
about
his
neck
and
carried
all
the
devils
to
a
smith
who
had
eight
apprentices
and
the
master
nine
how
much
do
you
want
to
hammer
this
pouch
eight
days
and
nights
they
agreed
upon
forty
ounces
and
hammered
day
and
night
and
the
pouch
was
not
reduced
to
powder
and
brother
giovannone
was
always
present
the
last
day
the
smiths
said
what
the
devil
are
these
for
they
can
not
be
pounded
fine
brother
giovannone
answered
they
are
indeed
devils
pound
hard
after
they
were
through
hammering
he
took
the
pouch
and
emptied
it
out
in
the
plain
the
devils
were
so
bruised
and
mangled
that
they
could
hardly
drag
themselves
back
to
hell
then
brother
giovannone
went
and
knocked
again
at
paradise
who
is
there
brother
giovannone
there
is
no
room
for
you
peter
if
you
do
let
me
in
i
will
call
you
baldhead
now
that
you
have
called
me
baldhead
said
peter
you
shall
not
enter
brother
giovannone
said
ah
what
is
that
you
say
i
will
be
even
with
you
so
he
stood
near
the
gate
of
paradise
and
said
to
all
the
souls
who
were
going
to
enter
in
the
name
of
brother
giovannone
into
my
pouch
all
you
souls
and
no
more
souls
entered
paradise
one
day
peter
said
to
the
master
why
do
no
more
souls
enter
the
lord
answered
because
brother
giovannone
is
behind
the
gate
putting
them
all
in
his
pouch
what
shall
we
do
said
peter
the
lord
answered
see
if
you
can
get
hold
of
the
pouch
and
bring
them
all
in
together
brother
giovannone
heard
all
this
outside
what
did
he
do
he
said
into
the
pouch
with
myself
and
in
a
moment
was
in
his
own
pouch
when
peter
looked
brother
giovannone
was
not
to
be
seen
so
he
seized
the
pouch
and
dragged
it
into
paradise
and
shut
the
gate
at
once
and
opened
the
pouch
the
first
one
who
came
out
was
brother
giovannone
himself
who
began
at
once
to
quarrel
with
peter
because
peter
wished
to
put
him
out
and
brother
giovannone
did
not
want
to
go
then
the
lord
said
when
one
once
enters
the
house
of
jesus
he
does
not
leave
it
again
these
stories
have
close
parallels
in
two
roman
legends
collected
by
miss
busk
in
the
first
the
innkeeper
asks
first
for
the
faculty
of
always
winning
at
cards
and
second
that
any
one
who
climbs
his
must
stay
there
when
death
comes
the
host
asks
her
death
is
feminine
in
italian
to
climb
the
tree
and
pick
him
a
few
figs
when
once
up
the
tree
the
host
refuses
to
let
her
down
until
she
promises
him
four
hundred
years
of
life
death
has
to
consent
and
the
host
in
turn
promises
to
go
quietly
with
her
when
she
comes
again
at
the
end
of
the
four
hundred
years
death
takes
the
host
to
paradise
they
pass
by
hell
on
the
way
and
the
host
proposes
to
the
devil
to
play
for
the
newly
received
souls
the
host
wins
fifteen
thousand
which
he
carries
with
him
to
paradise
peter
objects
to
letting
the
rabble
in
and
jesus
christ
himself
says
the
host
may
come
in
himself
but
he
has
no
business
with
the
others
then
the
host
says
that
he
has
made
no
difficulty
about
numbers
when
christ
has
come
to
his
inn
with
as
many
as
he
pleased
that
is
true
that
is
right
answered
jesus
christ
let
them
all
in
let
them
all
in
in
the
other
story
a
priest
pret
olivo
received
from
the
lord
in
reward
for
his
hospitality
the
favor
of
living
a
hundred
years
and
that
when
death
came
to
fetch
him
he
should
be
able
to
give
her
what
orders
he
pleased
and
that
she
must
obey
him
death
called
at
the
end
of
the
hundred
years
and
pret
olivo
made
her
sit
by
the
fire
while
he
said
a
mass
the
fire
grew
hotter
and
hotter
but
death
could
not
stir
until
pret
olivo
permitted
her
to
on
condition
that
she
should
leave
him
alone
a
hundred
years
the
second
time
death
called
pret
olivo
asked
her
to
gather
him
some
figs
and
commanded
her
to
stay
in
the
tree
so
death
a
second
time
was
obliged
to
promise
him
a
respite
of
a
hundred
years
the
next
time
death
called
pret
olivo
put
on
his
vestments
and
a
cope
and
took
a
pack
of
cards
in
his
hand
and
went
with
death
she
wanted
to
take
him
directly
to
paradise
but
he
insisted
on
going
around
by
the
way
of
hell
and
playing
a
game
of
cards
with
the
devil
the
stakes
were
souls
and
as
fast
as
pret
olivo
won
he
hung
a
soul
on
his
cope
until
it
was
covered
with
them
then
he
hung
them
on
his
beretta
and
at
last
was
obliged
to
stop
for
there
was
no
more
room
to
hang
any
souls
death
objected
to
taking
all
these
souls
to
paradise
but
could
not
take
pret
olivo
without
them
when
they
arrived
at
paradise
peter
made
some
objection
to
admitting
them
but
the
master
gave
his
permission
and
they
all
got
in
the
tuscan
version
which
contains
some
of
the
traits
of
the
last
story
is
as
follows
lxv
godfather
misery
godfather
misery
was
old
god
knows
how
old
one
day
jesus
and
peter
while
wandering
through
the
world
to
name
the
countries
came
to
godfather
misery
who
offered
his
visitors
some
polenta
and
gave
them
his
own
bed
jesus
pleased
with
this
reception
gave
him
some
money
and
granted
him
these
three
favors
that
whoever
sits
on
his
bench
near
the
fire
can
not
get
up
that
whoever
climbs
his
can
not
descend
and
finally
out
of
regard
to
peter
the
salvation
of
his
soul
one
day
death
came
to
godfather
misery
and
wanted
to
carry
him
off
godfather
misery
said
it
is
too
cold
to
travel
death
pressed
him
then
he
asked
her
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
warm
herself
a
moment
and
he
would
soon
be
ready
meanwhile
he
piled
wood
on
the
fire
death
felt
herself
burning
and
tried
to
move
but
could
not
so
she
had
to
grant
godfather
misery
another
hundred
years
of
life
death
was
released
the
hundred
years
passed
and
death
returned
godfather
misery
was
at
the
door
pretending
to
wait
for
her
and
looking
at
his
in
sorrow
he
begged
death
to
pick
him
a
few
figs
for
their
journey
so
death
climbed
up
but
could
not
descend
until
she
granted
godfather
misery
another
hundred
years
even
these
passed
and
death
reappeared
this
time
there
was
no
help
he
must
go
death
gave
him
time
only
to
recite
an
ave
maria
and
a
paternoster
godfather
misery
however
could
not
find
this
time
and
said
to
death
who
was
hurrying
him
you
have
given
me
time
and
i
am
taking
it
then
death
had
recourse
to
a
stratagem
and
disguised
herself
like
a
jesuit
and
went
where
godfather
misery
lived
and
preached
godfather
misery
at
first
did
not
attend
these
sermons
but
his
wife
finally
persuaded
him
to
go
to
the
church
and
hear
a
sermon
just
as
he
entered
the
preacher
cried
out
that
whoever
said
an
ave
maria
should
save
his
soul
godfather
misery
who
recognized
death
answered
from
a
distance
go
away
you
will
not
get
me
then
death
went
away
in
despair
and
never
got
hold
of
him
again
godfather
misery
still
lives
since
misery
never
ends
in
another
tuscan
story
similar
gifts
are
bestowed
upon
a
smith
who
had
always
been
a
good
christian
to
enable
him
to
avoid
a
contract
he
had
made
with
the
devil
to
sell
him
his
soul
for
two
years
of
life
the
first
time
the
devil
comes
he
sits
on
the
bench
near
the
fire
and
can
not
rise
again
until
he
extends
his
contract
two
years
the
next
time
he
comes
he
does
not
enter
the
house
but
looks
in
at
a
window
that
has
the
power
to
detain
any
one
who
looks
through
it
again
the
contract
is
extended
the
third
time
the
devil
is
caught
in
the
and
then
a
new
contract
is
drawn
up
that
the
devil
and
the
smith
are
never
to
see
each
other
again
the
second
class
of
versions
of
the
story
of
is
where
the
legend
is
merely
an
episode
of
some
other
story
this
class
comprises
two
stories
from
the
territory
of
venice
the
first
is
entitled
beppo
pipetta
from
the
hero
who
saved
the
king
life
which
is
threatened
by
some
robbers
the
king
was
in
disguise
and
beppo
did
not
know
who
he
was
until
he
was
summoned
to
the
palace
to
be
rewarded
the
king
told
beppo
that
he
need
not
be
a
soldier
any
longer
but
might
remain
with
him
or
wherever
he
pleased
and
offered
to
pay
for
all
he
needed
for
he
had
saved
his
life
we
give
the
rest
of
the
story
in
the
words
of
the
original
lxvi
beppo
pipetta
when
his
first
joy
at
this
good
fortune
was
over
beppo
decided
to
visit
his
relations
there
he
met
a
man
in
the
street
who
entered
into
conversation
with
him
and
they
chatted
for
a
long
time
until
they
finally
went
into
an
inn
to
refresh
themselves
with
something
to
eat
and
drink
how
happens
it
asked
his
new
friend
who
was
vastly
entertained
by
beppo
conversation
that
you
a
soldier
carry
no
knapsack
hm
said
beppo
i
do
care
to
weigh
myself
down
on
a
march
with
unnecessary
things
i
have
no
effects
and
if
i
need
anything
i
have
a
good
master
who
pays
all
my
bills
now
said
the
stranger
i
will
give
you
a
knapsack
and
a
very
valuable
one
too
for
if
you
say
to
any
one
in
he
will
jump
into
the
sack
with
these
words
the
stranger
took
his
leave
wait
thought
beppo
i
will
put
this
to
the
proof
and
indeed
a
favorable
opportunity
offered
itself
for
just
then
the
landlord
appeared
to
demand
the
payment
of
his
bill
what
do
you
want
asked
beppo
my
money
you
might
know
that
of
yourself
let
me
alone
i
have
no
money
what
you
ragged
soldier
jump
in
said
beppo
and
the
landlord
went
over
his
ears
into
the
sack
only
after
long
entreaty
and
on
condition
that
he
would
never
again
present
his
bill
would
beppo
let
him
out
again
just
wait
fellow
i
teach
you
how
to
insult
soldiers
said
he
to
the
landlord
as
he
went
out
tired
and
hungry
after
a
long
walk
beppo
again
turned
into
an
inn
there
he
saw
a
man
who
was
continually
emptying
a
purse
but
never
finished
for
it
always
became
full
again
he
quickly
snatched
the
purse
out
of
the
man
hand
and
ran
out
of
the
inn
but
no
less
quickly
did
the
owner
run
after
him
and
since
he
had
not
walked
as
far
as
beppo
who
had
been
wandering
about
all
day
he
soon
caught
up
with
him
then
beppo
cried
jump
in
and
the
owner
was
in
the
sack
listen
said
beppo
after
he
had
somewhat
recovered
his
breath
listen
and
be
reasonable
you
have
had
the
purse
long
enough
give
it
to
me
now
or
else
you
shall
always
stay
in
the
sack
what
could
the
man
do
willingly
or
unwillingly
he
had
to
give
up
the
purse
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
accursed
sack
for
two
years
beppo
stayed
at
home
doing
much
good
with
the
purse
and
much
mischief
with
the
sack
until
at
last
he
began
to
long
for
the
capital
again
and
returned
there
but
what
was
his
astonishment
at
seeing
everything
hung
with
black
and
everybody
in
mourning
do
you
not
know
what
the
trouble
is
he
was
asked
in
reply
to
his
questions
as
to
the
cause
of
this
sorrow
do
you
know
that
the
devil
is
going
to
carry
away
the
king
daughter
on
account
of
a
foolish
vow
that
her
father
once
made
then
he
went
directly
to
the
king
in
order
to
console
him
but
the
latter
would
not
put
any
faith
in
him
your
majesty
said
he
you
do
not
know
what
beppo
pipetta
can
do
only
let
me
have
my
own
way
then
he
prepared
in
a
room
of
the
palace
a
large
table
with
paper
pen
and
ink
while
the
princess
in
the
next
room
awaited
her
sad
fate
in
prayer
at
midnight
a
fearful
noise
was
heard
like
the
roaring
of
the
tempest
and
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
the
devil
came
through
the
window
into
the
sack
which
beppo
held
open
for
him
crying
jump
in
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
beppo
of
the
raging
devil
how
does
that
concern
you
i
have
my
reasons
was
the
bold
reply
wait
a
little
you
rascal
cried
beppo
i
teach
you
manners
and
he
seized
a
stick
and
belabored
the
sack
until
the
devil
in
anguish
called
upon
all
the
saints
are
you
going
to
carry
off
the
princess
now
no
no
only
let
me
out
of
this
infamous
sack
do
you
promise
never
to
molest
her
i
promise
only
let
me
out
no
said
beppo
you
must
repeat
your
promise
before
witnesses
and
also
give
it
in
writing
then
he
called
some
gentlemen
of
the
court
into
the
room
had
the
promise
repeated
and
permitted
the
devil
to
stretch
one
hand
out
of
the
sack
in
order
to
write
as
follows
i
the
very
devil
herewith
promise
that
i
will
neither
carry
away
the
princess
nor
ever
molest
her
in
future
satan
spirit
of
hell
good
said
beppo
the
affair
of
the
princess
is
now
ended
but
now
on
account
of
your
previous
impoliteness
allow
me
to
give
you
a
few
blows
that
may
serve
as
reminders
of
me
on
your
journey
when
he
had
done
this
he
opened
the
sack
and
the
devil
went
out
as
he
had
come
in
through
the
window
then
the
king
gave
a
great
feast
at
which
beppo
sat
between
him
and
the
princess
and
there
was
joy
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
after
a
while
beppo
took
a
pleasure
trip
and
came
to
a
place
that
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
decided
to
remain
there
but
the
police
must
needs
go
through
certain
ceremonies
and
wanted
to
know
who
he
was
whence
he
came
and
a
multitude
of
other
things
then
he
answered
i
am
myself
let
that
suffice
you
if
you
want
to
know
anything
more
write
to
the
king
accordingly
they
wrote
to
the
king
but
he
commanded
them
to
treat
him
with
respect
and
not
to
disturb
him
when
he
had
lived
for
many
years
in
this
place
and
had
grown
old
death
came
and
knocked
at
his
door
beppo
opened
it
and
asked
who
are
you
i
am
death
was
the
answer
jump
in
cried
beppo
in
great
haste
and
behold
death
was
in
the
sack
what
he
exclaimed
shall
i
who
have
so
much
to
do
loiter
my
time
away
here
just
stay
where
you
are
you
old
villain
replied
beppo
and
did
not
let
him
out
for
a
year
and
a
half
then
there
was
universal
satisfaction
throughout
the
world
the
physicians
being
especially
jubilant
for
none
of
them
ever
lost
a
patient
then
death
begged
so
humbly
and
represented
so
forcibly
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
this
disorder
that
beppo
agreed
to
let
him
out
on
condition
that
death
should
not
come
back
for
him
unless
he
was
willing
death
departed
and
sought
by
means
of
a
few
wars
and
pestilences
to
make
up
for
lost
time
at
length
beppo
grew
so
old
that
life
became
distasteful
to
him
then
he
sent
for
death
who
however
would
not
come
fearing
that
beppo
might
change
his
mind
so
the
latter
decided
to
go
himself
to
death
death
was
not
at
home
but
remembering
his
vacation
in
the
sack
had
prudently
left
the
order
that
in
case
a
certain
beppo
pipetta
should
come
he
was
to
be
beaten
soundly
an
order
which
was
executed
punctiliously
beaten
and
cast
out
by
death
he
went
sadly
to
hell
but
there
the
devil
had
given
the
porter
orders
to
show
him
the
same
attention
that
he
had
received
at
death
abode
and
that
command
also
was
conscientiously
obeyed
smarting
from
the
blows
he
had
received
and
vexed
that
neither
death
nor
the
devil
wanted
him
he
went
to
paradise
here
he
announced
himself
to
peter
but
the
saint
thought
that
he
had
better
first
consult
the
lord
meanwhile
beppo
threw
his
cap
over
the
wall
into
paradise
after
he
had
waited
a
while
peter
reappeared
and
said
i
am
very
sorry
but
our
lord
does
want
you
here
very
well
said
beppo
but
you
will
at
least
let
me
get
my
cap
and
with
that
he
slipped
through
the
gate
and
sat
down
on
the
cap
when
peter
commanded
him
to
get
up
and
begone
he
replied
composedly
gently
my
dear
sir
at
present
i
am
sitting
on
my
own
property
where
i
do
not
receive
orders
from
any
one
and
so
he
remained
in
paradise
the
story
known
to
our
readers
from
the
grimm

from

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a

his
wife
who
had
a
child
that
they
would
not
baptize
until
they
could
find
a
just
man
for
his
godfather
the
father
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
went
into
the
street
to
look
for
this
just
man
after
he
had
walked
along
a
while
he
met
a
man
who
was
our
lord
and
said
to
him

do
not

to
any
one
who

lord
answered
but
i
do
know
whether
i
am

then
the
peasant
passed
on
and
met
a
woman
who
was
the
madonna
and
said
to
her
i
have
this
child
to

and
do
not
wish

the
madonna
but

way
and
met
another

and
then

then
they
baptized
the
child
and
afterwards
death
led
the
peasant
into
a
very
long
room
where
there
were
many
lights
burning
godmother
said
the
man
astonished
at
seeing
all
the
lights
what
are
all
these
lights
death
said
these
are
the
lights
of
all
the
souls
in
the
world
would
you
like
to
see
friend
this
is
yours
and
this
is
your
son
when
the
peasant
saw
that
his
light
was
about
to
expire
he
said
and
when
the
oil
is
all
consumed
godmother
then
answered
death
you
must
come
with
me
for
i
am
death
oh
for
mercy
sake
cried
the
peasant
let
me
at
least
take
a
little
oil
from
my
son
lamp
and
put
it
in
mine
no
no
godfather
said
death
i
do
do
anything
of
that
sort
you
wished
to
see
a
just
person
and
a
just
person
you
have
found
and
now
go
home
and
arrange
your
affairs
for
i
am
waiting
for
you
we
can
mention
but
briefly
another
venetian
legend
which
like
several
of
those
already
given
reaches
back
to
the
middle
ages
a
wealthy
knight
who
has
led
a
wicked
life
repents
when
he
grows
old
and
his
confessor
enjoins
on
him
a
three
years
penance
the
knight
refuses
for
he
might
die
at
the
end
of
two
years
and
lose
all
that
amount
of
penance
he
refuses
in
turn
a
penance
of
two
years
of
one
year
and
even
of
a
month
but
agrees
to
do
penance
for
one
night
he
mounts
his
horse
takes
leave
of
his
family
and
rides
away
to
the
church
which
is
at
some
distance
after
he
has
ridden
for
a
time
his
daughter
comes
running
after
him
and
calls
him
back
for
robbers
have
attacked
the
castle
he
will
not
be
diverted
from
his
purpose
and
tells
her
that
there
are
servants
and
soldiers
enough
to
defend
the
house
then
a
servant
cries
out
that
the
castle
is
in
flames
and
his
own
wife
calls
for
help
against
violence
the
knight
calmly
continues
his
way
leaving
his
servants
to
act
for
him
and
simply
saying
i
have
no
time
for
it
now
finally
he
enters
the
church
and
begins
his
penance
here
he
is
disturbed
by
the
sexton
who
bids
him
depart
so
that
he
can
close
the
church
a
priest
orders
him
to
leave
as
he
is
not
worthy
to
hear
a
mass
at
midnight
twelve
watchmen
come
and
order
him
to
go
with
them
to
the
judge
but
he
will
not
move
for
any
of
them
at
two
a
band
of
soldiers
surround
him
and
order
him
to
depart
and
at
five
a
wild
throng
of
people
burst
into
the
church
and
cry
let
us
drive
him
out
then
the
church
begins
to
burn
and
the
knight
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
flames
but
still
he
moves
not
at
last
when
the
appointed
hour
comes
he
leaves
the
church
and
rides
home
to
find
that
none
of
his
family
had
left
the
castle
but
the
various
persons
who
had
tried
to
divert
him
from
his
penance
were
emissaries
of
the
devil
then
the
knight
sees
how
great
a
sinner
he
was
and
declares
that
he
will
do
penance
all
the
rest
of
his
life
bernoni
in
his
gives
nine
legends
one
of
which
is
the
story
of
peter
mother
mentioned
above
of
the
remaining
ones
several
may
be
classed
under
ghost
stories
and
two
illustrate
the
great
sanctity
attached
by
the
italian
to
the
spiritual
relationship
contracted
by
godmothers
and
godfathers
and
by
groomsmen
and
the
bride
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
romish
church
a
godfather
or
godmother
contracts
a
spiritual
relationship
with
the
godson
or
goddaughter
and
their
parents
which
would
prevent
marriage
between
the
parties
this
relationship
the
popular
imagination
has
extended
to
the
godfather
and
godmother
and
any
improper
intimacy
between
the
two
is
regarded
as
the
most
deadly
sin
the
first
of
bernoni
legends
is
entitled
lxviii
of
a
godfather
and
a
godmother
of
john
who
made
love
here
in
venice
heaven
knows
how
many
centuries
ago
there
was
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
husband
and
wife
who
were
rich
people
well
there
frequented
their
house
a
godfather
of
john
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
and
his
godmother
the
one
who
had
been
godmother
to
the
same
child
to
which
he
had
been
godfather
the
lady
of
the
house
made
love
to
each
other
in
secret
this
lady
had
a
maid
and
this
maid
knew
everything
so
one
day
this
lady
said
to
the
maid
hold
your
tongue
and
you
see
that
you
will
be
satisfied
with
me
when
i
come
to
die
you
shall
have
an
allowance
of
a
dollar
a
day
so
this
maid
kept
always
on
good
terms
with
the
lady
it
happened
that
the
fell
very
ill
the
lady
was
so
desperately
sorry
that
her
husband
kept
saying
to
her
come
will
you
make
yourself
ill
too
no
use
fretting
for
it
what
we
must
all
come
to
at
last
the
died
and
she
took
it
so
to
heart
that
she
fell
ill
in
earnest
when
her
husband
saw
her
giving
way
to
such
low
spirits
he
began
to
suspect
that
there
had
been
something
between
her
and
the
but
he
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
annoy
her
but
bore
it
like
a
philosopher
the
maid
was
always
by
her
mistress
bedside
and
the
mistress
said
to
her
remember
that
if
i
die
you
must
watch
by
me
quite
alone
for
i
wo
have
any
one
else
and
the
maid
promised
her
that
she
would
well
that
day
went
by
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
the
lady
got
worse
and
worse
until
at
last
she
died
you
can
fancy
how
sorry
her
husband
was
and
the
maid
and
the
other
servants
were
very
sorry
too
for
she
was
a
very
good
lady
the
other
servants
offered
to
sit
up
and
watch
with
the
maid
but
she
said
no
i
must
sit
up
by
myself
for
my
mistress
said
she
would
have
no
others
and
they
said
very
well
if
you
want
anything
ring
the
bell
and
we
shall
be
ready
to
do
anything
you
want
then
the
maid
had
four
tapers
lighted
and
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
she
took
the
office
for
the
dead
in
her
hand
and
began
to
read
it
just
at
midnight
the
door
of
the
room
burst
open
and
she
saw
the
figure
of
the
come
in
directly
she
saw
him
she
felt
her
blood
turn
to
water
she
tried
to
cry
out
but
she
was
so
terrified
that
she
could
make
a
sound
then
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
went
to
ring
the
bell
and
the
dead
man
without
saying
a
word
because
of
course
dead
folks
ca
talk
gave
her
a
sharp
blow
on
the
hand
to
prevent
her
from
ringing
and
he
signed
her
to
take
a
taper
in
her
hand
and
come
with
him
to
her
mistress
bed
she
obeyed
when
the
dead
man
got
to
the
bedside
he
took
the
lady
and
sat
her
up
on
the
bed
and
he
began
to
put
her
stockings
on
her
feet
and
he
dressed
her
from
head
to
foot
when
she
was
dressed
he
pulled
her
out
of
bed
took
her
by
the
arm
and
they
both
went
out
at
the
door
with
the
maid
going
before
them
to
light
the
way
in
this
palace
there
was
an
underground
passage
there
are
many
like
it
in
venice
and
they
went
down
into
it
when
they
got
to
a
certain
part
of
it
he
gave
a
great
knock
to
the
taper
that
the
maid
had
in
her
hand
and
left
her
in
the
dark
the
maid
was
so
terrified
that
she
fell
down
on
the
ground
all
rolled
up
together
like
a
ball
and
there
she
lay
at
daybreak
the
other
servants
thought
they
would
go
and
see
how
the
maid
was
getting
on
as
she
had
not
called
them
all
night
so
they
went
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
saw
nobody
there
at
all
either
living
or
dead
they
were
frightened
out
of
their
wits
and
ran
to
their
master
and
said
oh
mercy
on
us
there
nobody
left
neither
the
dead
woman
nor
the
live
one
the
room
quite
empty
said
the
master
you
do
say
so
then
he
dressed
himself
as
fast
as
he
could
and
went
and
looked
and
found
nobody
and
he
saw
that
the
clothes
his
wife
wore
to
go
out
in
were
gone
too
then
he
called
the
servants
and
said
to
them
here
take
these
torches
and
let
us
go
and
look
in
the
underground
passage
so
all
the
people
went
down
there
with
lighted
torches
and
after
searching
about
a
bit
they
found
the
poor
maid
who
gave
no
sign
of
life
the
servants
took
her
by
one
arm
but
it
was
all
bent
up
stiff
and
would
move
and
they
tried
the
other
arm
and
that
was
the
same
and
all
her
body
was
knotted
together
quite
stiff
then
they
took
up
this
ball
of
a
woman
and
carried
her
and
put
her
on
her
bed
the
master
sent
for
the
doctors
to
see
if
they
could
bring
back
life
to
her
and
by
degrees
she
began
to
open
her
eyes
and
move
her
fingers
but
she
had
had
a
stroke
and
could
speak
but
by
the
movements
of
her
fingers
they
could
make
out
nearly
everything
she
wanted
to
say
then
the
master
had
the
torches
lighted
again
and
went
down
again
into
the
underground
passage
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
trace
of
the
dead
woman
they
looked
and
looked
but
they
could
find
nothing
but
a
deep
hole
and
the
master
understood
directly
that
that
was
where
his
wife
and
her
had
been
swallowed
up
and
upon
that
he
went
again
but
he
would
stay
any
longer
in
that
palace
nor
even
in
venice
and
he
went
away
to
verona
and
in
the
palace
he
left
the
maid
with
her
dollar
a
day
and
people
to
take
care
of
her
and
feed
her
for
to
the
end
of
her
days
she
was
bedridden
and
could
speak
and
the
master
would
have
every
one
free
to
go
and
see
that
sight
that
it
might
be
a
warning
to
all
people
who
had
the
evil
intention
of
not
respecting
the
baptismal
relationship
the
second
of
bernoni
legends
turns
on
the
peculiar
sanctity
of
the
relation
of
a
groomsman
de
to
the
bride
the
full
title
is
about
a
de
who
pressed
the
bride
hand
with
evil
intent
it
is
as
follows
lix
the
groomsman
you
must
know
that
we
venetians
have
a
saying
that
the
groomsman
is
the
godfather
of
the
first
child
well
in
the
parish
of
the
angel
raphael
it
happened
that
there
was
a
young
man
and
woman
who
were
in
love
with
each
other
so
they
agreed
to
be
married
and
the
bridegroom
looked
out
for
his
best
man
according
to
custom
directly
he
had
chosen
his
best
man
he
took
him
to
the
bride
house
and
said
to
her
look
here
this
is
your
groomsman
directly
the
groomsman
saw
the
bride
he
fell
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
he
consented
more
than
willingly
to
be
the
best
man
well
the
wedding
day
came
and
this
man
went
into
the
church
with
evil
thoughts
in
his
heart
when
they
came
out
of
the
church
they
had
a
collation
according
to
custom
and
then
in
the
afternoon
they
had
a
gondola
to
go
to
the
tavern
as
people
used
to
do
on
such
days
first
the
bride
got
into
the
gondola
with
the
best
man
and
then
the
bridegroom
and
the
relations
when
they
were
getting
into
the
boat
the
groomsman
took
the
bride
hand
to
help
her
in
and
he
squeezed
it
and
squeezed
it
so
hard
that
he
hurt
her
severely
as
time
went
on
he
saw
that
the
bride
thought
nothing
about
him
and
he
began
not
to
care
for
her
either
but
by
and
by
he
began
to
have
a
sort
of
scruple
of
conscience
about
what
he
had
done
to
his
on
the
wedding
day
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
felt
this
scruple
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
confession
and
to
tell
his
confessor
what
he
had
done
and
with
what
evil
intention
you
have
committed
a
great
sin
my
son
said
the
priest
i
shall
give
you
a
penance
a
heavy
penance
will
you
do
it
yes
father
said
he
tell
me
what
it
is
the
priest
answered
listen
you
must
make
a
journey
in
the
to
a
place
that
i
shall
tell
you
of
but
mind
whatever
voices
you
hear
you
must
never
turn
back
for
an
instant
and
take
three
apples
with
you
and
you
will
meet
three
noblemen
and
you
must
give
one
apple
to
each
of
them
then
the
priest
told
him
the
place
he
was
to
go
to
and
the
groomsman
left
him
well
he
waited
until
and
then
he
took
his
three
apples
and
set
out
he
walked
and
walked
and
walked
until
at
last
he
came
to
the
place
the
priest
had
told
him
of
and
he
heard
such
a
talking
and
murmuring
you
ca
think
one
voice
said
one
thing
and
one
another
these
were
all
folks
who
had
committed
great
sins
against
john
but
he
knew
nothing
about
that
he
heard
them
calling
out
turn
back
turn
back
but
not
he
no
he
went
straight
on
without
ever
looking
round
let
them
call
ever
so
much
after
he
had
gone
on

an
apple
apiece

cloak
and
the

that
the
gentleman
had
great
difficulty
in
stretching
his
arm
out
to
take
the
apple
at
length
he
pulled
his
arm
from
under
his
cloak
and
showed
a
hand
swelled
up
to
such
a
huge
size
that
the
was
frightened
to
look
at
it
but
he
gave
him
the
apple
the
same
as
to
the
others
and
they
all
three
thanked
him
and
went
away
the
returned
home
again
and
went
to
his
confessor
and
told
him
all
that
had
happened
then
the
priest
said

the
first
of
the
three
noblemen
was
the
lord
the

third
was

what
a
hand
he
had
well
that

day
and
so
instead
of
squeezing
the
hand
you
really
hurt
st
john
the
third
legend
is
entitled
of
two
of

who
swore
by
the

some
time

more
for
his
oath
was
only
to
be
at
that
spot
the
sanctity
of
an
ordinary
oath
is
shown
in
the
fourth
story
of
two
lovers

and
death

know
it
and
the
young
man

continued
to
visit
her
as
usual
and
she
began
to
grow
pale
and
thin
the
father
discovered
the
state
of
the
case
and
consulted
the
priest
who
learned
from
the
girl
in
confession
how
matters
stood
and
came
with
a
black
cat
a
stole
and
book
to
conjure
the
spirit
and
save
the
girl
the

basket
she
finds
in

this
she
does
with
the
words
here
master

your
arm
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
he
took
the
arm
angrily
and
said
you
may
thank
god
you
have
that
cat
in
your
arms
otherwise
what
i
am
that
you
would
be
also
the
sixth
legend
is
of
an
incredulous
priest
who
believes
that
where
the
dead
are
there
they
stay
it
is
as
follows
lxx
the
parish
priest
of
san
marcuola
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
parish
priest
at
san
marcuola
here
in
venice
who
was
a
very
good
man
he
could
bear
to
see
women
in
church
with
hats
or
bonnets
on
their
heads
and
he
had
spirit
enough
to
go
and
make
them
take
them
off
for
said
he
the
church
is
the
house
of
god
and
what
is
not
permitted
to
men
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
women
but
when
a
woman
had
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
he
would
have
her
throw
it
over
her
head
that
she
might
not
be
stared
at
and
ogled
but
this
priest
had
one
fault
he
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
and
one
day
he
was
preaching
a
sermon
and
in
this
sermon
he
said
to
the
people
listen
now
dearly
beloved
brethren
this
morning
when
i
came
into
the
church
here
there
comes
up
to
me
one
of
my
flock
and
she
says
to
me
all
in
a
flutter
father
what
a
fright
i
have
had
this
night
i
was
asleep
in
my
bed
and
the
ghosts
came
and
twitched
away
my
coverlet
but
i
answered
her
daughter
that
is
not
possible
because
the
dead
are
there
they
and
so
he
declared
before
all
the
congregation
that
it
was
not
true
that
the
dead
could
come
back
and
be
seen
and
heard
in
the
evening
the
priest
went
to
bed
as
usual
and
about
midnight
he
heard
the
ring
loudly
the
servant
went
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
saw
a
great
company
of
people
in
the
street
and
she
called
out
who
there
and
they
asked
her
if
the
priest
of
san
marcuola
was
at
home
and
she
said
yes
but
he
was
in
bed
then
they
said
he
must
come
down
but
the
priest
when
he
heard
about
it
refused
to
go
they
then
began
to
ring
the
bell
again
and
tell
the
servant
to
call
her
master
and
the
priest
said
he
would
go
anywhere
then
all
the
doors
burst
open
and
the
whole
company
marched
into
the
priest
bedroom
and
bade
him
get
up
and
dress
himself
and
come
with
them
and
he
was
obliged
to
do
what
they
said
when
they
reached
a
certain
spot
they
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
gave
him
so
many
knocks
and
cuffs
that
he
did
know
which
side
to
turn
himself
and
then
they
said
this
is
for
a
remembrance
of
the
poor
defunct
and
upon
that
they
all
vanished
away
and
were
seen
no
more
and
the
poor
priest
went
back
home
bruised
from
head
to
foot
and
so
the
ghosts
proved
plain
enough
that
it
is
true
to
say
the
dead
are
there
they
the
story
of
don
juan
appears
in
the
seventh
legend
entitled
lxxi
the
gentleman
who
kicked
a
skull
there
was
once
a
youth
who
did
nothing
but
eat
drink
and
amuse
himself
because
he
was
immensely
wealthy
and
had
nothing
to
think
about
he
scoffed
at
every
one
he
dishonored
all
the
young
girls
he
played
all
sorts
of
tricks
and
was
tired
of
everything
one
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
give
a
grand
banquet
and
thereupon
he
invited
all
his
friends
and
many
women
and
all
his
acquaintances
while
they
were
preparing
the
banquet
he
took
a
walk
and
passed
through
a
street
where
there
was
a
cemetery
while
walking
he
noticed
on
the
ground
a
skull
he
gave
it
a
kick
and
then
he
went
up
to
it
and
said
to
it
in
jest
you
too
will
come
will
you
not
to
my
banquet
then
he
went
his
way
and
returned
home
at
the
house
the
banquet
was
ready
and
the
guests
had
all
arrived
they
sat
down
to
the
table
and
ate
and
drank
to
the
sound
of
music
and
diverted
themselves
joyfully
meanwhile
midnight
drew
near
and
when
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
a
ringing
of
bells
was
heard
the
servants
went
to
see
who
it
was
and
beheld
a
great
ghost
who
said
to
them
tell
count
robert
that
i
am
the
one
he
invited
this
morning
to
his
banquet
they
went
to
their
master
and
told
him
what
the
ghost
had
said
the
master
said
i
all
those
whom
i
invited
are
here
and
i
have
invited
no
one
else
they
said
if
you
should
see
him
it
is
a
ghost
that
is
terrifying
then
it
came
into
the
young
man
mind
that
it
might
be
that
dead
man
and
he
said
to
the
servants
quick
quick
close
the
doors
and
balconies
so
that
he
can
not
enter
the
servants
went
to
close
everything
but
hardly
had
they
done
so
when
the
doors
and
balconies
were
thrown
wide
open
and
the
ghost
entered
he
went
up
where
they
were
feasting
and
said
robert
robert
was
it
not
enough
for
you
to
profane
everything
have
you
wished
to
disturb
the
dead
also
the
end
has
come
all
were
terrified
and
fled
here
and
there
some
concealing
themselves
and
some
falling
on
their
knees
then
the
ghost
seized
robert
by
the
throat
and
strangled
him
and
carried
him
away
with
him
and
thus
he
has
left
this
example
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
mock
the
poor
dead
the
ninth
and
last
of
bernoni
legends
is
a
story
about
massariol
the
domestic
spirit
of
the
venetians
a
man
of
family
whose
business
takes
him
out
at
night

in
the
street
a
basket
containing
an
infant
the

is
very
cold
so
the
good
man
carries
the
foundling
home
and
his
wife
who
already
has
a
young
child
makes
the
little
stranger
as
comfortable
as
possible
he
is
cared
for
and
put
in
the
cradle
by
the
side
of
the
other
child
the
husband
and
wife
have
to
leave
the
room
a
moment
when
they
return
the
foundling
has
disappeared
the
husband
asks
in
amazement
what
can
it
mean
she
answers
i
am
sure
i
do
know
can
it
be
massariol
then
he
goes
out
on
the
balcony
and
sees
at
a
distance
one
who
seems
like
a
man
but
is
not
who
is
clapping
his
hands
and
laughing
and
making
all
manner
of
fun
of
him
and
then
suddenly
disappears
the
same
mischievous
spirit
plays
many
other
pranks
sometimes
he
cheats
the
ferrymen
out
of
their
toll
sometimes
he
disguises
himself
like
the
baker
lad
and
calls
at
the
houses
to
take
the
bread
to
the
oven
and
then
carries
it
away
to
some
square
or
bridge
sometimes
when
the
washing
is
hung
out
he
carries
it
off
to
some
distant
place
and
when
the
owners
have
at
last
found
their
property
massariol
laughs
in
their
faces
and
disappears
the
woman
who
related
these
stories
to
bernoni
added
massariol
has
never
done
anything
bad
he
likes
to
laugh
and
joke
and
fool
people
he
too
has
been
shut
up

and
magicians
pitrè
collection
contains
little
that
falls
under
the
second
heading
of
this
chapter
the
following
story
however
is
interesting
from
its
english
parallels
lxxiii
saddaedda
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
girl
called
saddaedda
who
was
crazy
one
day
when
her
mother
had
gone
into
the
country
and
she
was
left
alone
in
the
house
she
went
into
a
church
where
the
funeral
service
was
being
read
over
the
body
of
a
rich
lady
the
girl
hid
herself
in
the
confessional
no
one
knew
she
was
there
so
when
the
other
people
had
gone
she
was
left
alone
with
the
corpse
it
was
dressed
out
in
a
robe
and
everything
else
becoming
and
it
had
in
its
ears
and
rings
on
its
fingers
these
the
girl
took
off
and
then
she
began
to
undress
the
body
when
she
came
to
the
stockings
she
drew
off
one
easily
but
at
the
other
she
had
to
pull
so
hard
that
at
last
the
leg
came
off
with
it
saddaedda
took
the
leg
carried
it
to
her
lonely
home
and
locked
it
up
in
a
box
at
night
came
the
dead
lady
and
knocked
at
the
door
who
there
said
the
girl
it
is
i
answered
the
corpse
give
me
back
my
leg
and
stocking
but
saddaedda
paid
no
heed
to
the
request
next
day
she
prepared
a
feast
and
invited
some
of
her
playfellows
to
spend
the
night
with
her
they
came
feasted
and
went
to
sleep
at
midnight
the
dead
woman
began
to
knock
at
the
door
and
to
repeat
last
night
request
saddaedda
took
no
notice
of
the
noise
but
her
companions
whom
it
awoke
were
horrified
and
as
soon
as
they
could
they
ran
away
on
the
third
night
just
the
same
happened
on
the
fourth
she
could
persuade
only
one
girl
to
keep
her
company
on
the
fifth
she
was
left
entirely
alone
the
corpse
came
forced
open
the
door
strode
up
to
saddaedda
bed
and
strangled
her
then
the
dead
woman
opened
the
box
took
out
her
leg
and
stocking
and
carried
them
off
with
her
to
her
grave
this
chapter
would
be
incomplete
without
reference
to
treasure
stories
a
number
of
these
are
given
by
miss
busk
in
her
interesting
collection
a
few
are
found
in
pitrè
only
one
of
which
needs
mention
here
on
account
of
its
parallels
in
other
countries
it
is
called

was
at
palermo
a
man
who
sold

night

him
and
said

there
you
will
find

he
dreamed
the
same
thing
the
third
time
he
went
under
the
bridge
and
found
a
poor
man
all
in
rags
the
was
frightened
and
was
going
away

the
man
called

the
tales
we
have
thus
far
given
although
they
may
count
many
young
people
among
their
auditors
are
not
distinctly
children
stories
the
few
that
follow
are
and
it
is
greatly
to
be
regretted
that
their
number
is
not
larger
that
many
more
exist
can
not
be
doubted
but
collectors
have
probably
overlooked
this
interesting
class
even
pitrè
in
his
large
collection
gives
but
eleven
nos
and
those
in
the
other
collections
are
mostly
parallels
to
pitrè
we
will
begin
with
those
that
are
advantages
taken
of
children
love
for
stories
the
first
is
from
venice
bernoni
punt

and
is
called

do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
story
of
mr
attentive
tell
me
it
but
you
must
not
say
me
it
for
it
is
the
story
of

which
lasts
a
long
time
which
is
never
explained
do
you
wish

to

king
this
pope
and
this
dwarf
then
the
begins
again
but
it
is
time
to
give
some
of
the
stories
that
are
told
to
the
good
children
the
first
is
from
pitrè
no
and
is
called
lxxvi
don
firriulieddu
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
farmer
who
had
a
daughter
who
used
to
take
his
dinner
to
him
in
the
fields
one
day
he
said
to
her
so
that
you
may
find
me
i
will
sprinkle
bran
along
the
way
you
follow
the
bran
and
you
will
come
to
me
by
chance
the
old
ogre
passed
that
way
and
seeing
the
bran
said
this
means
something
so
he
took
the
bran
and
scattered
it
so
that
it
led
to
his
own
house
when
the
daughter
set
out
to
take
her
father
his
dinner
she
followed
the
bran
until
she
came
to
the
ogre
house
when
the
ogre
saw
the
young
girl
he
said
you
must
be
my
wife
then
she
began
to
weep
when
the
father
saw
that
his
daughter
did
not
appear
he
went
home
in
the
evening
and
began
to
search
for
her
and
not
finding
her
he
asked
god
to
give
him
a
son
or
a
daughter
a
year
after
he
had
a
son
whom
they
called
when
the
child
was
three
days
old
it
spoke
and
said
have
you
made
me
a
cloak
now
give
me
a
little
dog
and
the
cloak
for
i
must
look
for
my
sister
so
he
set
out
and
went
to
seek
his
sister
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
plain
where
he
saw
a
number
of
men
and
asked
whose
cattle
are
these
the
herdsman
replied
they
belong
to
the
ogre
who
fears
neither
god
nor
the
saints
who
fears
who
is
three
days
old
and
is
on
the
way
and
gives
his
dog
bread
and
says
my
dog
and
do
not
bark
for
we
have
fine
things
to
do
afterwards
he
saw
a
flock
of
sheep
and
asked
whose
are
these
sheep
and
received
the
same
answer
as
from
the
herdsman
then
he
arrived
at
the
ogre
house
and
knocked
and
his
sister
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
child
who
are
you
looking
for
she
said
i
am
looking
for
you
for
i
am
your
brother
and
you
must
return
to
mamma
when
the
ogre
heard
that
was
there
he
went
and
hid
himself
asked
his
sister
where
is
the
ogre
said
to
his
dog
go
and
bark
and
i
will
follow
you
the
dog
went
up
and
barked
and
followed
him
and
killed
the
ogre
then
he
took
his
sister
and
a
quantity
of
money
and
they
went
home
to
their
mother
and
are
all
contented
certain
traits
in
the
above
story
as
the
size
of
the
hero
and
the
bran
serving
to
guide
the
girl
to
her
father
recall
somewhat
faintly
it
is
true
our
own
tom
thumb
it
is
only
recently
that
a
tuscan
version
of
tom
thumb
has
been
found
it
is
called
lxxvii
little
l
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
husband
and
wife
who
had
no
children
the
husband
was
a
carpenter
and
when
he
came
home
from
his
shop
he
did
nothing
but
scold
his
wife
because
she
had
no
children
and
the
poor
woman
was
constantly
weeping
and
despairing
she
was
charitable
and
had
festivals
celebrated
in
the
church
but
no
children
one
day
a
woman
knocked
at
her
door
and
asked
for
alms
but
the
carpenter
wife
answered
i
will
not
give
you
any
for
i
have
given
alms
and
had
masses
said
and
festivals
celebrated
for
a
long
time
and
have
no
son
give
me
alms
and
you
will
have
children
good
in
that
case
i
will
do
all
you
wish
you
must
give
me
a
whole
loaf
of
bread
and
i
will
give
you
something
that
will
bring
you
children
if
you
will
i
will
give
you
two
loaves
no
no
now
i
want
only
one
you
can
give
me
the
other
when
you
have
the
children
so
she
gave
her
a
loaf
and
the
woman
said
now
i
will
go
home
and
give
my
children
something
to
eat
and
then
i
will
bring
you
what
will
make
you
have
children
very
well
footnote
l
dim
of
the
woman
went
home
fed
her
children
and
then
took
a
little
bag
filled
it
with
and
carried
it
to
the
carpenter
wife
and
said
this
is
a
bag
of
peas
put
them
in
the
and
they
will
be
as
many
sons
as
there
are
peas
there
were
a
hundred
peas
and
the
carpenter
wife
said
how
can
a
hundred
peas
become
a
hundred
sons
you
will
see
the
carpenter
wife
said
to
herself
i
had
better
say
nothing
about
it
to
my
husband
because
if
by
any
mischance
the
children
should
not
come
he
would
give
me
a
fine
scolding
her
husband
returned
at
night
and
began
to
grumble
as
usual
but
his
wife
said
not
a
word
and
went
to
bed
repeating
to
herself
you
will
see
the
next
morning
the
hundred
peas
had
become
a
hundred
sons
one
cried
papa
i
want
to
drink
another
said
papa
i
want
to
eat
another
papa
take
me
up
he
in
the
midst
of
all
this
tumult
took
a
stick
and
went
to
the
trough
and
began
to
beat
and
killed
them
all
one
fell
out
imagine
how
small
they
were
and
ran
quickly
into
the
bedroom
and
hid
himself
on
the
handle
of
the
pitcher
after
the
carpenter
had
gone
to
his
shop
his
wife
said
what
a
rascal
he
has
grumbled
so
long
about
my
not
having
children
and
now
he
has
killed
them
all
then
the
son
who
had
escaped
said
mamma
has
papa
gone
she
said
yes
my
son
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
where
are
you
hush
i
am
in
the
handle
of
the
pitcher
tell
me
has
papa
gone
yes
yes
yes
come
out
then
the
child
who
had
escaped
came
out
and
his
mamma
exclaimed
oh
how
pretty
you
are
how
shall
i
call
you
the
child
answered
cecino
very
well
bravo
my
cecino
do
you
know
cecino
you
must
go
and
carry
your
papa
dinner
to
him
at
the
shop
yes
you
must
put
the
little
basket
on
my
head
and
i
will
go
and
carry
it
to
papa
the
carpenter
wife
when
it
was
time
put
the
basket
on
cecino
head
and
sent
him
to
carry
her
husband
dinner
to
him
when
cecino
was
near
the
shop
he
began
to
cry
o
papa
come
and
meet
me
i
am
bringing
you
your
dinner
the
carpenter
said
to
himself
oh
did
i
kill
them
all
or
are
there
any
left
he
went
to
meet
cecino
and
said
o
my
good
boy
how
did
you
escape
my
blows
i
fell
down
ran
into
the
room
and
hid
myself
on
the
handle
of
the
pitcher
bravo
cecino
listen
you
must
go
around
among
the
country
people
and
hear
whether
they
have
anything
broken
to
mend
yes
so
the
carpenter
put
cecino
in
his
pocket
and
while
he
went
along
the
way
did
nothing
but
chatter
so
that
every
one
said
he
was
mad
because
they
did
not
know
that
he
had
his
son
in
his
pocket
when
he
saw
some
countrymen
he
asked
have
you
anything
to
mend
yes
there
are
some
things
about
the
oxen
broken
but
we
can
not
let
you
mend
them
for
you
are
mad
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
mad
i
am
wiser
than
you
why
do
you
say
i
am
mad
because
you
do
nothing
but
talk
to
yourself
on
the
road
i
was
talking
with
my
son
and
where
do
you
keep
your
son
in
my
pocket
that
is
a
pretty
place
to
keep
your
son
very
well
i
will
show
him
to
you
and
he
pulls
out
cecino
who
was
so
small
that
he
stood
on
one
of
his
father
fingers
oh
what
a
pretty
child
you
must
sell
him
to
us
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
sell
you
my
son
who
is
so
valuable
to
me
well
then
do
sell
him
to
us
what
does
he
do
then
he
takes
cecino
and
puts
him
on
the
horn
of
an
ox
and
says
stay
there
for
now
i
am
going
to
get
the
things
to
mend
yes
yes
do
be
afraid
i
will
stay
on
my
horn
so
the
carpenter
went
to
get
the
things
to
mend
meanwhile
two
thieves
passed
by
and
seeing
the
oxen
one
said
see
those
two
oxen
there
alone
come
let
us
go
and
steal
them
when
they
drew
near
cecino
cried
out
papa
look
out
there
are
thieves
here
they
are
stealing
your
oxen
ah
where
does
that
voice
come
from
and
they
approached
nearer
to
see
and
cecino
the
nearer
he
saw
them
come
the
more
he
called
out
look
out
for
your
oxen
papa
the
thieves
are
stealing
them
when
the
carpenter
came
the
thieves
said
to
him
good
man
where
does
that
voice
come
from
it
is
my
son
if
he
is
not
here
where
is
he
do
you
see
there
he
is
up
on
the
horn
of
one
of
the
oxen
when
he
showed
him
to
them
they
said
you
must
sell
him
to
us
we
will
give
you
as
much
money
as
you
wish
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
might
sell
him
to
you
but
who
knows
how
much
my
wife
would
grumble
about
it
do
you
know
what
you
must
tell
her
that
he
died
on
the
way
they
tempted
him
so
much
that
at
last
he
gave
him
to
them
for
two
sacks
of
money
they
took
their
cecino
put
him
in
one
of
their
pockets
and
went
away
on
their
journey
they
saw
the
king
stable
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
king
stable
and
see
whether
we
can
steal
a
pair
of
horses
very
good
they
said
to
cecino
do
betray
us
do
be
afraid
i
will
not
betray
you
so
they
went
into
the
stable
and
stole
three
horses
which
they
took
home
and
put
in
their
own
stable
afterwards
they
went
and
said
to
cecino
listen
we
are
so
tired
save
us
the
trouble
go
down
and
give
the
horses
some
oats
cecino
went
to
do
so
but
fell
asleep
on
the
halter
and
one
of
the
horses
swallowed
him
when
he
did
not
return
the
thieves
said
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
stable
so
they
went
there
and
looked
for
him
and
called
cecino
where
are
you
inside
of
the
black
horse
then
they
killed
the
black
horse
but
cecino
was
not
there
cecino
where
are
you
in
the
bay
horse
so
they
killed
the
bay
horse
but
cecino
was
not
there
cecino
where
are
you
but
cecino
answered
no
longer
then
they
said
what
a
pity
that
child
who
was
so
useful
to
us
is
lost
then
they
dragged
out
into
the
fields
the
two
horses
that
they
had
cut
open
a
famished
wolf
passed
that
way
and
saw
the
dead
horses
now
i
will
eat
my
fill
of
horse
and
he
ate
and
ate
until
he
had
finished
and
had
swallowed
cecino
m
then
the
wolf
went
off
until
it
became
hungry
again
and
said
let
us
go
and
eat
a
goat
footnote
m
it
appears
from
this
that
cecino
had
been
in
one
of
the
horses
all
the
time
but
the
thieves
had
not
seen
him
because
he
was
so
small
when
cecino
heard
the
wolf
talk
about
eating
a
goat
he
cried
out
the
wolf
is
coming
to
eat
your
goats
the
wolf
supposes
that
it
has
swallowed
some
wind
that
forms
these
words
hits
itself
against
a
stone
and
after
several
trials
gets
rid
of
the
wind
and
cecino
who
hides
himself
under
a
stone
so
that
he
shall
not
be
seen
three
robbers
passed
that
way
with
a
bag
of
money
one
of
them
said
now
i
will
count
the
money
and
you
others
be
quiet
or
i
will
kill
you
you
can
imagine
whether
they
kept
still
for
they
did
not
want
to
die
so
he
began
to
count
one
two
three
four
and
five
and
cecino
one
two
three
four
and
five
do
you
understand
he
repeats
the
robber
words
i
hear
you
you
will
not
keep
still
well
i
will
kill
you
we
shall
see
whether
you
will
speak
again
he
began
to
count
the
money
again
one
two
three
four
and
five
cecino
repeats
one
two
three
four
and
five
then
you
will
not
keep
quiet
now
i
will
kill
you
and
he
killed
one
of
them
now
we
shall
see
whether
you
will
talk
if
you
do
i
will
kill
you
too
he
began
to
count
one
two
three
four
and
five
cecino
repeats
one
two
three
four
and
five
take
care
if
i
have
to
tell
you
again
i
will
kill
you
do
you
think
i
want
to
speak
i
do
wish
to
be
killed
he
begins
to
count
one
two
three
four
and
five
cecino
repeats
one
two
three
four
and
five
you
will
not
keep
quiet
either
now
i
will
kill
you
and
he
killed
him
now
i
am
alone
and
can
count
by
myself
and
no
one
will
repeat
it
so
he
began
again
to
count
one
two
three
four
and
five
and
cecino
one
two
three
four
and
five
then
the
robber
said
there
is
some
one
hidden
here
i
had
better
run
away
or
he
will
kill
me
so
he
ran
away
and
left
behind
the
sack
of
money
when
cecino
perceived
that
there
was
no
one
there
he
came
out
put
the
bag
of
money
on
his
head
and
started
for
home
when
he
drew
near
his
parents
house
he
cried
oh
mamma
come
and
meet
me
i
have
brought
you
a
bag
of
money
when
his
mother
heard
him
she
went
to
meet
him
and
took
the
money
and
said
take
care
you
do
drown
yourself
in
these
puddles
of
the
mother
went
home
and
turned
back
to
look
for
cecino
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
she
told
her
husband
what
cecino
had
done
and
they
went
and
searched
everywhere
for
him
and
at
last
found
him
drowned
in
a
puddle
the
next
story
is
one
that
has
always
enjoyed
great
popularity
over
the
whole
of
europe
and
is
a
most
interesting
example
of
the
diffusion
of
nursery
tales
it
is
also
interesting
from
the
attempt
to
show
that
it
is
of
comparatively
late
date
and
has
been
borrowed
from
a
people
not
of
european
extraction
the
story
belongs
to
the
class
of
what
may
be
called
accumulative
stories
of
which
the
house
that
jack
built
is
a
good
example
it
is
a
version
of
the
story
so
well
known
in
english
of
the
old
woman
who
found
a
little
crooked
sixpence
and
went
to
market
and
bought
a
little
pig
as
she
was
coming
home
the
pig
would
not
go
over
the
stile
the
old
woman
calls
on
a
dog
to
bite
pig
but
the
dog
will
not
then
she
calls
in
turn
on
a
stick
fire
water
ox
butcher
rope
rat
and
cat
they
all
refuse
to
help
her
except
the
cat
which
promises
help
in
exchange
for
a
saucer
of
milk
so
away
went
the
old
woman
to
the
cow
but
the
cow
said
to
her
you
will
go
to
yonder
and
fetch
me
a
handful
of
hay
i
give
you
the
milk
so
away
went
the
old
woman
to
the
and
she
brought
the
hay
to
the
cow
as
soon
as
the
cow
had
eaten
the
hay
she
gave
the
old
woman
the
milk
and
away
she
went
with
it
in
a
saucer
to
the
cat
as
soon
as
the
cat
had
lapped
up
the
milk
the
cat
began
to
kill
the
rat
the
rat
to
gnaw
the
rope
the
rope
began
to
hang
the
butcher
the
butcher
began
to
kill
the
ox
the
ox
began
to
drink
the
water
the
water
began
to
quench
the
fire
the
fire
began
to
burn
the
stick
the
stick
began
to
beat

the

began
to
bite
the
pig
the
little
pig
in
a
fright
jumped
over
the
stile
and
so
the
old
woman
got
home
that
night
the
italian
versions
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
first
where
the
animals
and
inanimate
objects
are
invoked
to
punish
some
human
being
second
where
all
the
actors
are
animals
the
first
version
of
the
first
class
that
we
shall
give
is
from
sicily
pitrè

and
is
called
lxxviii

upon
a
time
there
was
a

the
italian
story
it
will
be
seen
has
a
moral
the
animals
are
invoked
to
punish
a
disobedient
child
in
the
neapolitan
version
a
mother
sends
her
son
to
gather
some
fodder
for
the
cattle
he
does
not
wish
to
go
until
he
has
had
some
macaroni
that
his
mother
has
just
cooked
she
promises
to
keep
him
some
and
he
departs
while
he
is
gone
the
mother
eats
up
all
the
macaroni
except
a
small
bit
when
her
son
returns
and
sees
how
little
is
left
for
him
he
begins
to
cry
and
refuses
to
eat
and
his
mother
calls
on
stick
fire
water
ox
rope
mouse
and
cat
to
make
her
son
obey
and
eat
the
macaroni
the
disobedient
son
is
also
found
in
two
tuscan
versions
one
from
siena
and
one
from
florence
which
are
almost
identical
in
the
venetian
version
a
naughty
boy
will
not
go
to
school
and
his
mother
invokes

ox
butcher
and
soldier
the
sicilian
story
of
the
sexton
nose
pitrè
no
will
serve
as
the
connecting
link
between
the
two
classes
above
mentioned
properly
speaking
only
the
second
part
of
it
belongs
here
but
we
will
give
a
brief
analysis
of
the
first
also
lxxix
the
sexton
nose
a
sexton
one
day
in
sweeping
the
church
found
a
piece
of
money
it
was
the
fifth
of
a
cent
and
deliberated
with
himself
as
to
what
he
would
buy
with
it
if
he
bought
nuts
or
almonds
he
was
afraid
of
the
mice
so
at
last
he
bought
some
roasted
peas
and
ate
all
but
the
last
pea
this
he
took
to
a
bakery
near
by
and
asked
the
mistress
to
keep
it
for
him
she
told
him
to
leave
it
on
a
bench
and
she
would
take
care
of
it
when
she
went
to
get
it
she
found
that
the
cock
had
eaten
it
the
next
day
the
sexton
came
for
the
roast
pea
and
when
he
heard
what
had
become
of
it
he
said
they
must
either
return
the
roast
pea
or
give
him
the
cock
this
they
did
and
the
sexton
not
having
any
place
to
keep
it
took
it
to
a
miller
wife
who
promised
to
keep
it
for
him
now
she
had
a
pig
which
managed
to
kill
the
cock
the
next
day
the
sexton
came
for
the
cock
and
on
finding
it
dead
demanded
the
pig
and
the
woman
had
to
give
it
to
him
the
pig
he
left
with
a
friend
of
his
a
whose
daughter
was
to
be
married
the
next
day
the
woman
was
mean
and
sly
and
killed
the
pig
for
her
daughter
wedding
meaning
to
tell
the
sexton
that
the
pig
had
run
away
the
sexton
however
when
he
heard
it
made
a
great
fuss
and
declared
that
she
must
give
him
back
his
pig
or
her
daughter
at
last
she
had
to
give
him
her
daughter
whom
he
put
in
a
bag
and
carried
away
he
took
the
bag
to
a
woman
who
kept
a
shop
and
asked
her
to
keep
for
him
this
bag
which
he
said
contained
bran
the
woman
by
chance
kept
chickens
and
she
thought
she
would
take
some
of
the
sexton
bran
and
feed
them
when
she
opened
the
bag
she
found
the
young
girl
who
told
her
how
she
came
there
the
woman
took
her
out
of
the
sack
and
put
in
her
stead
a
dog
the
next
day
the
sexton
came
for
his
bag
and
putting
it
on
his
shoulder
started
for
the
intending
to
throw
the
young
girl
in
the
sea
when
he
reached
the
shore
he
opened
the
bag
and
the
furious
dog
flew
out
and
bit
his
nose
the
sexton
was
in
great
agony
and
cried
out
while
the
blood
ran
down
his
face
in
torrents

there
are
other
versions
from
florence
bologna
and
venice
bernoni
punt
iii
which
do
not
call
for
any
detailed
notice
in
the
florentine
version
a
cock
gives
a
peck
at
a
mouse
head
and
the
mouse
cries
out
where
must
i
go
to
be
cured
then
follow
the
various
objects
which
are
almost
identical
with
those
in
the
other
versions
the
mouse
however
is
killed
by
the
ox
to
which
he
goes
last
the
venetian
version
is
the
most
elaborate
in
it
the
cock
and
mouse
go
nutting
together
and
while
the
former
flies
up
into
the
tree
and
throws
the
nuts
down
the
mouse
eats
them
all
up
when
the
cock
comes
down
he
flies
into
a
passion
and
gives
the
mouse
a
peck
at
his
head
the
mouse
runs
off
in
terror
and
the
rest
of
the
story
is
as
above
until
the
end
the
last
person
the
mouse
calls
on
is
a
cooper
to
make
him
a
bucket
to
give
to
the
well
to
get
water
etc
the
cooper
asks
for
money
which
the
mouse
finds
after
a
while
he
gives
the
money
to
the
cooper
and
says
take
and
count
it
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
drink
for
i
am
dying
of
thirst
as
he
is
going
to
drink
he
sees
friend
cock
coming
along
ah
poor
me
says
he
to
himself
i
am
a
dead
mouse
the
cock
sees
him
and
goes
to
meet
him
and
says
good
day
friend
are
you
still
afraid
of
me
come
let
us
make
peace
the
mouse
then
takes
heart
and
says
oh
yes
yes
let
us
make
peace
so
they
made
peace
and
friend
mouse
said
to
friend
cock
now
that
you
are
here
you
must
do
me
the
favor
to
hold
me
by
the
tail
while
i
hang
over
the
ditch
to
drink
and
when
i
say
pull
me
back
the
cock
said
i
will
do
as
you
wish
then
the
mouse
went
to
the
ditch
and
friend
cock
held
him
by
the
tail
after
the
mouse
had
drunk
his
fill
he
said
friend
the
cock
answered
friend
and
i
let
you
go
by
the
tail
and
in
truth
he
did
let
go
his
tail
and
the
poor
mouse
went
to
the
bottom
and
was
never
seen

godmother
goat
give
godmother
fox
her
house
back
right
away
the
goat
answered
i
am
godmother
goat
i
have
a
sword
at
my
side
and
with
my
fist
and
with
my
horns
i
will
smash
you
the
mouse
answered
at
once
i
am
godfather
mouse
by
my
side
i
have
a
spit
i
will
heat
it
in
the
fire
and
stick
it
in
your
tail
the
inference
of
course
is
that
godmother
goat
gave
back
the
house
the
story
does
not
say
so
but
ends
with
the
usual
formula
story
told
story
written
tell
me
yours
for
mine
is
said
pitrè
no
gives
another
version
in
which
a
goat
gets
under
a
bed
and
she
calls
on
her
neighbors
a
dog
pig
and
cricket
to
put
the
goat
out
the
cricket
alone
succeeds
with
a
threat
similar
to
that
in
the
last
story
in
the
neapolitan
version
imbriani
conti
an
old
woman
in
sweeping
the
church
found
a
piece
of
money
and
like
the
sexton
in
the
story
of
the
sexton
nose
did
not
know
what
to
buy
with
it
at
last
she
bought
some
flour
and
made
a
of
it
she
left
it
on
the
table
and
went
again
to
church
but
forgot
to
close
the
window
while
she
was
gone
a
herd
of
goats
came
along
and
one
smelled
the
pudding
climbed
in
at
the
window
and
ate
it
up
when
the
old
woman
came
back
and
tried
to
open
the
door
she
could
not
for
the
goat
was
behind
it
then
she
began
to
weep
and
various
animals
came
along
and
tried
to
enter
the
house
the
goat
answered
them
all
i
am
the
goat
with
three
horns
on
my
head
and
three
in
my
belly
and
if
you
do
run
away
i
will
eat
you
up
the
mouse
at
last
replied
i
am
godfather
mouse
with
the
halter
and
if
you
do
run
away
i
will
tear
your
eyes
out
the
goat
ran
away
and
the
old
woman
went
in
with
godfather
mouse
whom
she
married
and
they
both
lived
there
together
the
florentine
version
is
called
the
iron
goat
in
it
a
widow
goes
out
to
wash
and
leaves
her
son
at
home
with
orders
not
to
leave
the
door
open
so
that
the
iron
goat
with
the
iron
mouth
and
the
sword
tongue
can
enter
the
boy
after
a
time
wanted
to
go
after
his
mother
and
when
he
had
gone
half
way
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
door
open
and
went
back
when
he
was
going
to
enter
he
saw
there
the
iron
goat
who
is
there
it
is
i
i
am
the
iron
goat
with
the
iron
mouth
and
the
sword
tongue
if
you
enter
i
will
slice
you
like
a
turnip
the
poor
boy
sat
down
on
the
steps
and
wept
a
little
old
woman
passed
by
and
asked
the
cause
of
his
tears
he
told
her
and
she
said
she
would
send
the
goat
away
for
three
bushels
of
grain
the
old
woman
tried
with
the
usual
result
and
finally
said
to
the
boy
listen
my
child
i
do
care
for
those
three
bushels
of
grain
but
i
really
can
not
send
the
goat
away
then
an
old
man
tried
his
luck
with
no
better
success
at
last
a
little
bird
came
by
and
promised
for
three
bushels
of
millet
to
drive
the
goat
away
when
the
goat
made
its
usual
declaration
the
little
bird
replied
and
i
with
my
beak
will
peck
your
brains
out
the
goat
was
frightened
and
ran
away
and
the
boy
had
to
pay
the
little
bird
three
bushels
of
millet
the
next
story
affords
like
pitidda
a
curious
example
of
the
diffusion
of
nursery
tales
our
readers
will
remember
the
grimm
story
of
the
spider
and
the
flea
a
spider
and
a
flea
dwelt
together
in
one
house
and
brewed
their
beer
in
an
one
day
when
the
spider
was
stirring
it
up
she
fell
in
and
scalded
herself
thereupon
the
flea
began
to
scream
and
then
the
door
asked
why
are
you
screaming
flea
because
little
spider
has
scalded
herself
in
the
replied
she
thereupon
the
door
began
to
creak
as
if
it
were
in
pain
and
a
broom
which
stood
in
the
corner
asked
what
are
you
creaking
for
door
may
i
not
creak
it
replied
the
little
spider
scalded
herself
and
the
flea
weeps
so
a
broom
sweeps
a
little
cart
runs
ashes
burn
furiously
a
tree
shakes
off
its
leaves
a
maiden
breaks
her
pitcher
and
a
streamlet
begins
to
flow
until
it
swallows
up
the
little
girl
the
little
tree
the
ashes
the
cart
the
broom
the
door
the
flea
and
last
of
all
the
spider
all
together
the
first
italian
version
of
this
story
which
we
shall
mention
is
from
sicily
pitrè
no
and
is
called
lxxxii
the

replied
the

the
bird
went
and
alighted
on
a
fountain
which
said
bird
why
are
you
plucking
out
your
feathers
so
the
bird
answered
as
the
others

done
and
the
fountain
said
and
i
as
fountain
will

when
the
queen
had
told
him
everything
he
said
and
i
as
king
am
going
to
take
my
coffee
and
thus
the
story
abruptly
ends
in
one
of
pitrè
variants
a
sausage
takes
the
place
of
the
mouse
in
another
a
tortoise
in
the
version
from
pomigliano
imbriani
an
old
woman
who
finds
a
coin
in
sweeping
a
church
hesitates
in
regard
to
what
she
will
spend
it
for
as
in
the
stories
above
mentioned
she
finally
concludes
to
buy
some
paint
for
her
face
after
she
has
put
it
on
she
stations
herself
at
the
window
a
donkey
passes
and
asks
what
she
wants
she
answers
that
she
wishes
to
marry
will
you
take
me
asks
the
donkey
let
me
hear
what
kind
of
a
voice
you
have
ingò
ingò
away
away
you
would
frighten
me
in
the
night
then
a
goat
comes
along
with
the
same
result
then
follows
a
cat
and
all
the
animals
in
the
world
but
none
pleases
the
old
woman
at
last
a
little
mouse
passes
by
and
says
old
aunt
what
are
you
doing
there
i
want
to
marry
will
you
take
me
let
me
hear
your
voice
zivuzì
zivuzì
zivuzì
come
up
for
you
please
me
so
the
mouse
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
stayed
with
her
one
day
the
old
woman
went
to
mass
and
left
the
pot
near
the
fire
and
told
the
mouse
to
be
careful
not
to
fall
in
it
when
she
came
home
she
could
not
find
the
mouse
anywhere
at
last
she
went
to
take
the
soup
from
the
pot
and
there
she
found
the
mouse
dead
she
began
to
lament
and
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
began
to
scatter
and
the
window
asked
what
was
the
matter
the
ashes
answered
ah
you
know
nothing
friend
mouse
is
in
the
pot
the
old
woman
is
weeping
weeping
and
i
the
ashes
have
wished
to
scatter
then
the
window
opens
and
shuts
the
stairs
fall
down
the
bird
plucks
out
its
feathers
the
laurel
shakes
off
its
leaves
the
servant
girl
who
goes
to
the
well
breaks
her
pitcher
the
mistress
who
was
making
bread
throws
the
flour
over
the
balcony
and
finally
the
master
comes
home
and
after
he
hears
the
story
exclaims
and
i
who
am
master
will
break
the
bones
of
both
of
you
and
therewith
he
takes
a
stick
and
gives
the
servant
and
her
mistress
a
sound
beating
there
is
a
curious
class
of
versions
of
the
above
story
in
which
the
principal
actors
are
a
mouse
and
a
sausage
reminding
one
of
the
grimm
story
of
the
little
mouse
the
little
bird
and
the
sausage
in
the
venetian
version
bernoni
punt
iii
the
beginning
is
as
follows
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
mouse
and
a
sausage
and
one
day
the
mouse
said
to
the
sausage
i
am
going
to
mass
meanwhile
get
ready
the
dinner
yes
yes
answered
the
sausage
then
the
mouse
went
to
mass
and
when
he
returned
he
found
everything
ready
the
next
day
the
sausage
went
to
mass
and
the
mouse
prepared
the
dinner
he
put
on
the
pot
threw
in
the
rice
and
then
went
to
taste
if
it
was
well
salted
but
he
fell
in
and
died
the
sausage
returned
home
knocked
at
the
door
for
there
was
no
bell
and
no
one
answered
she
called
mouse
mouse
but
he
does
not
answer
then
the
sausage
went
to
a
smith
and
had
the
door
broken
in
and
called
again
mouse
where
are
you
and
the
mouse
did
not
answer
now
i
will
pour
out
the
rice
and
meanwhile
he
will
come
so
she
went
and
poured
out
the
rice
and
found
the
mouse
dead
in
the
pot
ah
poor
mouse
oh
my
mouse
what
shall
i
do
now
oh
poor
me
and
she
began
to
utter
a
loud
lamentation
then
the
table
began
to
go
around
the
room
the
sideboard
to
throw
down
the
plates
the
door
to
lock
and
unlock
itself
the
fountain
to
dry
up
the
mistress
to
drag
herself
along
the
ground
and
the
master
threw
himself
from
the
balcony
and
broke
his
neck
and
all
this
arose
from
the
death
of
this
mouse
the
version
from
the
marches
gianandrea
resembles
the
above
very
closely
the
conclusion
is
as
follows
the
mouse
the
master
of
this
castle
is
dead
the
sausage
weeps
the
broom
sweeps
the
door
opens
and
shuts
the
cart
runs
the
tree
throws
off
its
leaves
the
bird
plucks
out
its
feathers
the
servant
breaks
her
pitcher
etc
the
version
from
milan
resembles
the
one
from
venice
instead
of
the
mouse
and
the
sausage
we
have
the
big
mouse
and
the
little
mouse
in
the
version
from
leghorn
papanti
called
vezzino
and
lady
sausage
q
the
actors
are
lady
sausage
and
her
son
vezzino
who
falls
into
the
pot
on
the
fire
while
his
mother
is
at
mass
the
rest
of
the
story
does
not
differ
materially
from
the
above
versions
footnote
q
e
madonna
salciccia
is
the
dim
of
delight
pastime
in
the
grimm
story
of
the
golden
goose
the
goose
has
the
power
of
causing
anything
that
touches
it
to
stick
fast
this
same
idea
is
reproduced
in
several
italian
stories
the
best
is
from
venice
bernoni
and
is
called
lxxxiii
a
feast
day
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
husband
and
wife
the
husband
was
a
boatman
one
feast
day
the
boatman
took
it
into
his
head
to
buy
a
fowl
which
he
carried
home
and
said
see
here
wife
is
a
feast
day
i
want
a
good
dinner
cook
it
well
for
my
friend
tony
is
coming
to
dine
with
us
and
has
said
that
he
would
bring
a
tart
very
well
she
said
i
will
prepare
the
fowl
at
once
so
she
cleaned
it
washed
it
put
it
on
the
fire
and
said
while
it
is
boiling
i
will
go
and
hear
a
mass
she
shut
the
kitchen
door
and
left
the
dog
and
the
cat
inside
scarcely
had
she
closed
the
door
when
the
dog
went
to
the
hearth
and
perceived
that
there
was
a
good
odor
there
and
said
oh
what
a
good
smell
he
called
the
cat
also
and
said
cat
you
come
here
too
smell
what
a
good
odor
there
is
see
if
you
can
push
off
the
cover
with
your
paws
the
cat
went
and
scratched
and
scratched
and
down
went
the
cover
now
said
the
dog
see
if
you
can
catch
it
with
your
claws
then
the
cat
seized
the
fowl
and
dragged
it
to
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
the
dog
said
shall
we
eat
half
of
it
the
cat
said
let
us
eat
it
all
so
they
ate
it
all
and
stuffed
themselves
like
pigs
when
they
had
eaten
it
they
said
alas
for
us
what
shall
we
do
when
the
mistress
comes
home
she
will
surely
beat
us
both
so
they
both
ran
all
over
the
house
here
and
there
but
could
find
no
place
in
which
to
hide
they
were
going
to
hide
under
the
bed
no
they
said
for
she
will
see
us
they
were
going
under
the
sofa
but
that
would
not
do
for
she
would
see
them
there
finally
the
cat
looked
up
and
saw
under
the
beams
a
cobweb
he
gave
a
leap
and
jumped
into
it
the
dog
looked
at
him
and
said
run
away

and
she
climbs

of

listening
to
me
the
following
nonsense
story
from
venice
bernoni
punt
will
give
a
good
idea
of
a
class
that
is
not
very
well
represented
in
italy
it
is
called
lxxxiv
the
three
brothers
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
brothers
two
had
no
clothes
and
one
no
shirt
the
weather
was
very
bad
and
they
make
up
their
minds
to
go
shooting
so
they
took
down
three
guns
two
were
broken
and
one
had
no
barrel
and
walked
and
walked
until
they
came
at
last
to
a
meadow
where
they
saw
a
hare
they
began
to
fire
at
it
but
could
not
catch
it
what
shall
we
do
said
one
of
them
they
remembered
that
near
by
a
godmother
of
theirs
lived
so
they
went
and
knocked
at
her
door
and
asked
her
to
lend
them
a
pot
to
cook
the
hare
they
had
not
caught
the
godmother
was
not
at
home
but
nevertheless
she
answered
my
children
go
in
the
kitchen
and
there
you
will
find
three
pots
two
broken
and
one
with
no
bottom
take
whichever
you
wish
thanks
godmother
they
went
into
the
kitchen
and
chose
the
one
without
a
bottom
and
put
the
hare
in
it
to
cook
while
the
hare
was
cooking
one
said
let
us
ask
our
godmother
whether
she
has
anything
in
her
garden
so
they
asked
her
and
she
said
yes
yes
my
children
i
have
three
two
are
dead
and
one
has
never
borne
any
nuts
knock
off
as
many
as
you
wish
one
went
and
shook
the
tree
that
had
never
borne
nuts
and
a
little
nut
fell
on
his
hat
and
broke
his
heel
thereupon
they
picked
up
the
nuts
and
went
to
get
the
hare
which
meanwhile
was
cooked
and
said
what
shall
we
do
with
so
much
stuff
so
they
went
to
a
village
where
there
were
many
ill
and
they
put
up
a
notice
in
the
street
that
whoever
wished
might
at
such
and
such
a
place
get
broth
given
him
in
charity
every
one
went
to
get
some
and
they
took
it
in
the
and
it
was
given
to
them
with
a
skimmer
one
who
did
not
belong
to
the
village
drank
so
much
of
this
broth
that
he
was
at
the
point
of
death
then
they
sent
for
three
physicians
one
was
blind
one
deaf
and
one
dumb
the
blind
man
went
in
and
said
let
me
look
at
your
tongue
the
deaf
man
asked
how
are
you
the
dumb
said
give
me
some
paper
pen
and
ink
they
gave
them
to
him
and
he
said
go
to
the
apothecary
for
he
knows
the
business
buy
two
cents
worth
of
i
know
not
what
put
it
wherever
you
wish
he
will
get
well
i
know
not
when
i
will
leave
and
commend
him
to
you
one
of
the
most
popular
of
italian
tales
as
the
collector
tells
us
is
one
of
which
we
give
the
version
from
leghorn
papanti
it
is
called
lxxxv
buchettino
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
child
whose
name
was
buchettino
one
morning
his
mamma
called
him
and
said
buchettino
will
you
do
me
a
favor
go
and
sweep
the
stairs
buchettino
who
was
very
obedient
did
not
wait
to
be
told
a
second
time
but
went
at
once
to
sweep
the
stairs
all
at
once
he
heard
a
noise
and
after
looking
all
around
he
found
a
penny
then
he
said
to
himself
what
shall
i
do
with
this
penny
i
have
half
a
mind
to
buy
some
dates
but
no
for
i
should
have
to
throw
away
the
stones
i
will
buy
some
apples
no
i
will
not
for
i
should
have
to
throw
away
the
core
i
will
buy
some
nuts
but
no
for
i
should
have
to
throw
away
the
shells
what
shall
i
buy
then
i
will
buy
i
will
buy
enough
i
will
buy
a
pennyworth
of
figs
no
sooner
said
than
done
he
bought
a
pennyworth
of
figs
and
went
to
eat
them
in
a
tree
while
he
was
eating
the
ogre
passed
by
and
seeing
buchettino
eating
figs
in
the
tree
said
buchettino
my
dear
buchettino
give
me
a
little
fig
with
your
dear
little
hand
if
not
i
will
eat
you
buchettino
threw
him
one
but
it
fell
in
the
dirt
then
the
ogre
repeated
buchettino
my
dear
buchettino
give
me
a
little
fig
with
your
dear
little
hand
if
not
i
will
eat
you
then
buchettino
threw
him
another
which
also
fell
in
the
dirt
the
ogre
said
again
buchettino
my
dear
buchettino
give
me
a
little
fig
with
your
dear
little
hand
if
not
i
will
eat
you
poor
buchettino
who
did
not
see
the
trick
and
did
not
know
that
the
ogre
was
doing
everything
to
get
him
into
his
net
and
eat
him
up
what
does
he
do
he
leans
down
and
foolishly
gives
him
a
fig
with
his
little
hand
the
ogre
who
wanted
nothing
better
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
put
him
in
his
bag
then
he
took
him
on
his
back
and
started
for
home
crying
with
all
his
lungs
wife
my
wife
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
for
i
have
caught
buchettino
wife
my
wife
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
for
i
have
caught
buchettino
when
the
ogre
was
near
his
house
he
put
the
bag
on
the
ground
and
went
off
to
attend
to
something
else
buchettino
with
a
knife
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
cut
the
bag
open
in
a
trice
filled
it
with
large
stones
and
then
my
legs
it
is
no
shame
to
run
away
when
there
is
need
when
the
rascal
of
an
ogre
returned
he
picked
up
the
bag
and
scarcely
had
he
arrived
home
when
he
said
to
his
wife
tell
me
my
wife
have
you
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
she
answered
at
once
yes
then
said
the
ogre
we
will
cook
buchettino
come
here
help
me
and
both
taking
the
bag
they
carried
it
to
the
hearth
and
were
going
to
throw
poor
buchettino
into
the
kettle
but
instead
they
found
only
the
stones
imagine
how
cheated
the
ogre
was
he
was
so
angry
that
he
bit
his
hands
he
could
not
swallow
the
trick
played
on
him
by
buchettino
and
swore
to
find
him
again
and
be
revenged
so
the
next
day
he
began
to
go
all
about
the
city
and
to
look
into
all
the
hiding
places
at
last
he
happened
to
raise
his
eyes
and
saw
buchettino
on
a
roof
ridiculing
him
and
laughing
so
hard
that
his
mouth
extended
from
ear
to
ear
the
ogre
thought
he
should
burst
with
rage
but
he
pretended
not
to
see
it
and
in
a
very
sweet
tone
he
said
o
buchettino
just
tell
me
how
did
you
manage
to
climb
up
there
buchettino
answered
do
you
really
want
to
know
then
listen
i
put
dishes
upon
dishes
glasses
upon
glasses
pans
upon
pans
kettles
upon
kettles
afterwards
i
climbed
up
on
them
and
here
i
am
ah
is
that
so
said
the
ogre
wait
a
bit
and
quickly
he
took
so
many
dishes
so
many
glasses
pans
kettles
and
made
a
great
mountain
of
them
then
he
began
to
climb
up
to
go
and
catch
buchettino
but
when
he
was
on
the
top
everything
fell
down
and
that
rascal
of
an
ogre
fell
down
on
the
stones
and
was
cheated
again
then
buchettino
well
pleased
ran
to
his
mamma
who
put
a
piece
of
candy
in
his
little
mouth
see
whether
there
is
any
more
we
will
end
this
chapter
with
two
stories
in
which
the
chief
actors
are
animals
one
of
these
stories
will
doubtless
be
very
familiar
to
our
readers
the
first
is
from
venice
bernoni
punt
iii
lxxxvi
the
three
goslings
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
goslings
who
were
greatly
afraid
of
the
wolf
for
if
he
found
them
he
would
eat
them
one
day
the
largest
said
to
the
other
two
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
we
had
better
build
a
little
house
so
that
the
wolf
shall
not
eat
us
and
meanwhile
let
us
go
and
look
for
something
to
build
the
house
with
then
the
other
two
said
yes
yes
yes
good
let
us
go
so
they
went
and
found
a
man
who
had
a
load
of
straw
and
said
to
him
good
man
do
us
the
favor
to
give
us
a
little
of
that
straw
to
make
a
house
of
so
that
the
wolf
shall
not
eat
us
the
man
said
take
it
take
it
and
he
gave
them
as
much
as
they
wanted
the
goslings
thanked
the
man
and
took
the
straw
and
went
away
to
a
meadow
and
there
they
built
a
lovely
little
house
with
a
door
and
balconies
and
kitchen
with
everything
in
short
when
it
was
finished
the
largest
gosling
said
now
i
want
to
see
whether
one
is
comfortable
in
this
house
so
she
went
in
and
said
oh
how
comfortable
it
is
in
this
house
just
wait
she
went
and
locked
the
door
with
a
padlock
and
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
said
to
the
other
two
goslings
i
am
very
comfortable
alone
here
go
away
for
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
you
the
two
poor
little
goslings
began
to
cry
and
beg
their
sister
to
open
the
door
and
let
them
in
if
she
did
not
the
wolf
would
eat
them
but
she
would
not
listen
to
them
then
the
two
goslings
went
away
and
found
a
man
who
had
a
load
of
hay
they
said
to
him
good
man
do
us
the
kindness
to
give
us
a
little
of
that
hay
to
build
a
house
with
so
that
the
wolf
shall
not
eat
us
yes
yes
yes
take
some
take
some
and
he
gave
them
as
much
as
they
wanted
the
goslings
well
pleased
thanked
the
man
and
carried
the
hay
to
a
meadow
and
built
a
very
pretty
little
house
prettier
than
the
other
the
gosling
said
to
the
smallest
listen
i
am
going
now
to
see
whether
one
is
comfortable
in
this
house
but
i
will
not
act
like
our
sister
you
know
she
entered
the
house
and
said
to
herself
oh
how
comfortable
it
is
here
i
want
my
sister
i
am
very
comfortable
here
alone
so
she
went
and
fastened
the
door
with
a
padlock
and
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
said
to
her
sister
oh
how
comfortable
it
is
in
this
house
i
do
want
you
here
go
away
go
away
the
poor
gosling
began
to
weep
and
beg
her
sister
to
open
to
her
for
she
was
alone
and
did
not
know
where
to
go
and
if
the
wolf
found
her
he
would
eat
her
but
it
did
no
good
she
shut
the
balcony
and
stayed
in
the
house
then
the
gosling
full
of
fear
went
away
and
found
a
man
who
had
a
load
of
iron
and
stones
and
said
to
him
good
man
do
me
the
favor
to
give
me
a
few
of
those
stones
and
a
little
of
that
iron
to
build
me
a
house
with
so
that
the
wolf
shall
not
eat
me
the
man
pitied
the
gosling
so
much
that
he
said
yes
yes
good
gosling
or
rather
i
will
build
your
house
for
you
then
they
went
away
to
a
meadow
and
the
man
built
a
very
pretty
house
with
a
garden
and
everything
necessary
and
very
strong
for
it
was
lined
with
iron
and
the
balcony
and
door
of
iron
also
the
gosling
well
pleased
thanked
the
man
and
went
into
the
house
and
remained
there
now
let
us
go
to
the
wolf
the
wolf
looked
everywhere
for
these
goslings
but
could
not
find
them
after
a
time
he
learned
that
they
had
built
three
houses
good
good
he
said
wait
until
i
find
you
then
he
started
out
and
journeyed
and
journeyed
until
he
came
to
the
meadow
where
the
first
house
was
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
gosling
said
who
is
knocking
at
the
door
come
come
said
the
wolf
open
for
it
is
i
the
gosling
said
i
will
not
open
for
you
because
you
will
eat
me
open
open
i
will
not
eat
you
be
not
afraid
very
well
said
the
wolf
if
you
will
not
open
the
door
i
will
blow
down
your
house
and
indeed
he
did
blow
down
the
house
and
ate
up
the
gosling
now
that
i
have
eaten
one
he
said
i
will
eat
the
others
too
then
he
went
away
and
came
at
last
to
the
house
of
the
second
gosling
and
everything
happened
as
to
the
first
the
wolf
blew
down
the
house
and
ate
the
gosling
then
he
went
in
search
of
the
third
and
when
he
found
her
he
knocked
at
the
door
but
she
would
not
let
him
in
then
he
tried
to
blow
the
house
down
but
could
not
then
he
climbed
on
the
roof
and
tried
to
trample
the
house
down
but
in
vain
very
well
he
said
to
himself
in
one
way
or
another
i
will
eat
you
then
he
came
down
from
the
roof
and
said
to
the
gosling
listen
gosling
do
you
wish
us
to
make
peace
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
you
who
are
so
good
and
i
have
thought
that
we
will
cook
some
macaroni
and
i
will
bring
the
butter
and
cheese
and
you
will
furnish
the
flour
very
good
said
the
gosling
bring
them
then
the
wolf
well
satisfied
saluted
the
gosling
and
went
away
the
next
day
the
gosling
got
up
early
and
went
and
bought
the
meal
and
then
returned
home
and
shut
the
house
a
little
later
the
wolf
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
come
gosling
open
the
door
for
i
have
brought
you
the
butter
and
cheese
very
well
give
it
to
me
here
by
the
balcony
no
indeed
open
the
door
i
will
open
when
all
is
ready
then
the
wolf
gave
her
the
things
by
the
balcony
and
went
away
while
he
was
gone
the
gosling
prepared
the
macaroni
and
put
it
on
the
fire
to
cook
in
a
kettle
full
of
water
when
it
was
two
the
wolf
came
and
said
come
gosling
open
the
door
no
i
will
not
open
for
when
i
am
busy
i
do
want
any
one
in
the
way
when
it
is
cooked
i
will
open
and
you
may
come
in
and
eat
it
a
little
while
after
the
gosling
said
to
the
wolf
would
you
like
to
try
a
bit
of
macaroni
to
see
whether
it
is
well
cooked
open
the
door
that
is
the
better
way
no
no
do
think
you
are
coming
in
put
your
mouth
to
the
hole
in
the
shelf
and
i
will
pour
the
macaroni
down
the
wolf
all
greedy
as
he
was
put
his
mouth
to
the
hole
and
then
the
gosling
took
the
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
poured
the
boiling
water
instead
of
the
macaroni
through
the
hole
into
the
wolf
mouth
and
the
wolf
was
scalded
and
killed
then
the
gosling
took
a
knife
and
cut
open
the
wolf
stomach
and
out
jumped
the
other
goslings
who
were
still
alive
for
the
wolf
was
so
greedy
that
he
had
swallowed
them
whole
then
these
goslings
begged
their
sister
pardon
for
the
mean
way
in
which
they
had
treated
her
and
she
because
she
was
forgave
them
and
took
them
into
her
house
and
there
they
ate
their
macaroni
and
lived
together
happy
and
contented
a
curious
variant
of
the
above
story
is
found
in
the
same
collection
under
the
title
lxxxvii
the
cock
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
cock
and
this
cock
flew
here
and
flew
there
and
flew
on
an
arbor
and
there
he
found
a
letter
he
opened
the
letter
and
saw
cock
steward
and
that
he
was
invited
to
rome
by
the
pope
the
cock
started
on
his
journey
and
after
a
time
met
the
hen
where
are
you
going
friend
cock
said
the
hen
i
flew
said
he
upon
an
arbor
and
found
a
letter
and
this
letter
said
that
i
was
invited
to
rome
by
the
pope
just
see

said
the
hen
whether
i
am
there
too
wait
a
bit
then
he
turned
the
letter
and
saw
written
there
cock

hen
stewardess
come
friend
for
you
are
there
too
very
well
then
the
two
started
off
and
soon
met
the
goose
who
said
where
are
you
going
friend
cock
and
friend
hen
i
flew
said
the
cock
upon
an
arbor
and
i
found
a
letter
and
this
letter
said
that
we
were
invited
to
rome
by
the
pope
just
look
friend
whether
i
am
there
too
then
the
cock
opened
the
letter
read
it
and
saw
that
there
was
written
cock
steward
hen
stewardess
goose
abbess
come
come
friend
you
are
there
too
so
they
took
her
along
and
all
three
went
their
way
after
a
time
they
found
the
duck
and
the
cock
saw
written
in
the
letter
cock
steward
hen
stewardess
goose
abbess
duck
countess
they
next
met
a
little
bird
and
found
he
was
down
in
the
letter
as
little
finally
they
came
across
the
whom
they
found
mentioned
in
the
letter
as
on
their
journey
they
came
to
a
forest
and
saw
a
wolf
at
a
distance
the
cock
hen
goose
and
duck
plucked
out
their
feathers
and
built
houses
to
shelter
themselves
from
the
wolf
the
poor
bug
that
had
no
feathers
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
crept
into
it
the
wolf
came
and
as
in
the
last
story
blew
down
the
four
houses
and
devoured
their
occupants
then
he
tried
to
get
at
the
bug
in
the
same
way
but
blew
so
hard
that
he
burst
and
out
came
the
cock
hen
goose
and
duck
safe
and
sound
and
began
to
make
a
great
noise
the
bug
heard
it
and
came
out
of
her
hole
and
after
they
had
rejoiced
together
they
separated
and
each
returned
home
and
thought
no
more
of
going
to
rome
to
the
pope
there
is
a
version
from
the
marches
gianandrea
called
the
marriage
of
thirteen
the
animals
are
the
same
as
in
the
last
story
on
their
journey
they
meet
the
wolf
who
accompanies
them
although
his
name
is
not
in
the
letter
after
a
time
the
wolf
becomes
hungry
and
exclaims
i
am
hungry
the
cock
answers
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
very
well
then
i
will
eat
you
and
he
swallows
him
whole
and
so
he
devours
one
after
the
other
until
the
bird
only
remains
the
bird
flies
from
tree
to
tree
and
bush
to
bush
and
around
the
wolf
head
until
he
drives
him
wild
with
anger
at
last
along
comes
a
woman
with
a
basket
on
her
head
carrying
food
to
the
reapers
the
bird
says
to
the
wolf
that
if
he
will
spare
his
life
he
will
get
him
something
to
eat
from
the
basket
the
wolf
promises
and
the
bird
alights
near
the
woman
who
tries
to
catch
him
the
bird
flies
on
a
little
way
and
the
woman
puts
down
her
basket
and
runs
after
him
meanwhile
the
wolf
draws
near
the
basket
and
begins
eating
its
contents
when
the
woman
sees
that
she
cries
help
and
the
reapers
run
up
with
sticks
and
scythes
and
kill
the
wolf
and
the
animals
that
he
had
devoured
all
came
out
of
his
stomach
safe
and
sound
there
are
two
sicilian
versions
of
the
story
of
the
cock
one
pitrè
no
the
wolf
and
the
finch
opens
like
the
venetian
the
animals
are
cock
king
hen
queen
viper
chambermaid
wolf
pope
and
finch
keeper
of
the
castle
the
wolf
then
proceeds
to
confess
the
others
and
eats
them
in
turn
until
he
comes
to
the
finch
which
plays
a
joke
on
him
and
flies
away
the
conclusion
of
the
story
is
disfigured
nothing
being
said
of
the
wolf
punishment
or
the
recovery
of
the
other
animals
the
other
sicilian
version
is
in
gonzenbach
no
we
give
it
however
for
completeness
and
because
it
recalls
a
familiar
story
in
grimm
it
is
entitled
lxxxviii
the
cock
that
wished
to
become
pope
it
occurred
once
to
the
cock
to
go
to
rome
and
have
himself
elected
pope
so
he
started
out
and
on
the
way
found
a
letter
which
he
took
with
him
the
hen
met
him
and
asked
cock
where
are
you
going
i
am
going
to
rome
to
be
pope
will
you
take
me
with
you
she
asked
first
i
must
look
in
my
letter
said
the
cock
and
looked
at
his
letter
come
along
if
i
become
pope
you
can
be
the
popess
so
cock
and
hen
continued
their
journey
and
met
a
cat
who
said
cock
and
hen
where
are
you
going
we
are
going
to
rome
and
wish
to
be
pope
and
popess
will
you
take
me
with
you
wait
until
i
look
in
my
letter
said
the
cock
and
glanced
at
it
very
well
come
along
you
can
be
our
after
a
while
they
met
a
weasel
who
asked
where
are
you
going
cock
hen
and
mrs
cat
we
are
going
to
rome
where
i
intend
to
become
pope
answered
the
cock
will
you
take
me
with
you
wait
until
i
look
in
my
letter
said
he
when
the
cock
looked
in
his
letter
he
said
very
well
come
along
so
the
three
animals
continued
their
journey
together
towards
rome
at
they
came
to
a
little
house
where
lived
an
old
witch
who
had
just
gone
out
so
each
animal
chose
a
place
to
suit
him
the
weasel
sat
himself
in
the
cupboard
the
cat
on
the
hearth
in
the
warm
ashes
and
the
cock
and
the
hen
flew
up
on
the
beam
over
the
door
when
the
old
witch
came
home
she
wanted
to
get
a
light
out
of
the
cupboard
and
the
weasel
struck
her
in
the
face
with
his
tail
then
she
wanted
to
light
the
candle
and
went
to
the
hearth
she
took
the
bright
eyes
of
the
cat
for
live
coals
and
tried
to
light
the
match
by
them
and
hit
the
cat
in
the
eyes
the
cat
jumped
in
her
face
and
scratched
her
frightfully
when
the
cock
heard
all
the
noise
he
began
to
crow
loudly
then
the
witch
saw
that
they
were
no
ghosts
but
harmless
domestic
animals
and
took
a
stick
and
drove
all
four
out
of
the
house
the
cat
and
the
weasel
had
no
longer
any
desire
to
prolong
their
journey
but
the
cock
and
hen
continued
their
way
when
they
reached
rome
they
entered
an
open
church
and
the
cock
said
to
the
sexton
have
all
the
bells
rung
for
now
i
will
be
pope
good
answered
the
sexton
that
may
be
but
just
come
in
here
then
he
led
the
cock
and
the
hen
into
the
sacristry
shut
the
door
and
caught
them
both
after
he
had
caught
them
he
twisted
their
necks
and
put
them
in
the
pot
then
he
invited
his
friends
and
they
ate
with
great
glee

chapter
vi
stories
and
jests
until
the
reformation
europe
was
by
its
religion
and
the
culture
growing
out
of
it
a
homogeneous
state
not
only
however
did
the
legends
of
the
church
find
access
to
the
people
everywhere
but
the
stories
imported
from
the
orient
were
equally
popular
and
the
absence
of
other
works
of
entertainment
and
the
monotonous
character
of
the
legends
increased
the
popularity
of
tales
which
were
amusing
and
interesting
we
have
considered
in
other
places
the
fairy
tales
and
those
stories
which
are
of
more
direct
oriental
origin
in
the
present
chapter
we
shall
examine
those
stories
which
are
of
the
character
of
jests
or
amusing
stories
some
of
which
are
also
oriental
but
may
more
appropriately
be
classed
in
this
chapter
the
first
story
we
shall
mention
is
familiar
to
the
reader
from
the
ballad
of
king
john
and
the
abbot
of
canterbury
in
percy
and
bürger
poem
of
kaiser
und
der
there
are
two
popular
versions
in
italian
as
well
as
several
literary
ones
the
shortest
is
from
milan
imbriani
and
is
entitled
xci
the
cook
there
was
once
a
lord
whose
name
was
the
king
went
there
and
saw
this
name
on
the
door
and
said
that
if
he
had
nothing
to
think
of
he
would
give
him
something
to
think
of
he
told
him
that
he
must
do
in
a
week
the
three
things
which
he
told
him
first
to
tell
him
how
many
stars
there
were
in
heaven
how
many
fathoms
of
rope
it
would
take
to
reach
to
heaven
and
what
he
the
king
was
thinking
of
the
cook
saw
that
his
master
was
sad
and
sat
with
his
head
bent
over
the
table
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
and
his
master
told
him
everything
the
cook
promised
to
settle
the
matter
if
he
would
give
him
half
of
his
property
he
also
asked
for
the
skin
of
a
dead
ass
a
of
rope
and
his
master
hat
and
cloak
then
the
cook
went
to
the
king
who
said
to
him
well
how
many
stars
are
there
in
heaven
the
cook
answered
whoever
counts
the
hairs
on
this
ass
skin
will
know
how
many
stars
there
are
in
heaven
then
the
king
told
him
to
count
them
and
he
answered
that
his
share
was
already
counted
and
that
it
was
for
the
king
to
count
now
then
the
king
asked
him
how
many
fathoms
of
rope
it
would
take
to
reach
to
heaven
and
the
cook
replied
take
this
rope
and
go
to
heaven
and
then
come
back
and
count
how
many
fathoms
there
are
finally
the
king
asked
what
am
i
thinking
of
you
are
thinking
that
i
am
the
abbot
instead
of
that
i
am
the
cook
and
i
have
here
the
to
try
the
broth
the
version
in
pitrè
no
is
much
better
it
is
called
xcii
the
thoughtless
abbot
there
was
once
in
a
city
a
priest
who
became
an
abbot
and
who
had
his
carriages
horses
grooms
steward
secretary
valet
and
many
other
persons
on
account
of
the
wealth
that
he
had
this
abbot
thought
only
of
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
all
the
priests
and
laymen
were
jealous
of
him
and
called
him
the
thoughtless
abbot
one
day
the
king
happened
to
pass
that
way
and
stopped
and
all
the
abbot
enemies
went
to
him
straightway
and
accused
the
abbot
saying
your
majesty
in
this
town
there
is
a
person
happier
than
you
very
rich
and
lacking
nothing
in
the
world
and
he
is
called
the
abbot
after
reflection
the
king
said
to
the
accusers
gentlemen
depart
in
peace
for
i
will
soon
make
this
abbot
think
the
king
sent
directly
for
the
abbot
who
had
his
carriage
made
ready
and
went
to
the
king
in
his
coach
and
four
the
king
received
him
kindly
made
him
sit
at
his
side
and
talked
about
various
things
with
him
finally
he
asked
him
why
they
called
him
the
thoughtless
abbot
and
he
replied
that
it
was
because
he
was
free
from
care
and
that
his
servants
attended
to
his
interests
then
the
king
said
well
then
sir
abbot
since
you
have
nothing
to
do
do
me
the
favor
to
count
all
the
stars
in
the
sky
and
this
within
three
days
and
three
nights
otherwise
you
will
surely
be
beheaded
the
poor
thoughtless
abbot
on
hearing
these
words
began
to
tremble
like
a
leaf
and
taking
leave
of
the
king
returned
home
in
mortal
fear
for
his
neck
when
came
he
could
not
eat
on
account
of
his
great
anxiety
and
went
at
once
out
on
the
terrace
to
look
at
the
sky
but
the
poor
man
could
not
see
a
single
star
when
it
grew
dark
and
the
stars
came
out
the
poor
abbot
began
to
count
them
and
write
it
down
but
it
grew
dark
and
light
again
without
the
abbot
succeeding
in
his
task
the
cook
the
steward
the
secretaries
the
grooms
the
coachmen
and
all
the
persons
in
the
house
became
thoughtful
when
they
saw
that
their
master
did
not
eat
or
drink
and
always
watched
the
sky
not
knowing
what
else
to
think
they
believed
that
he
had
gone
mad
to
make
the
matter
short
the
three
days
passed
without
the
abbot
counting
the
stars
and
the
poor
man
did
not
know
how
to
present
himself
to
the
king
for
he
was
sure
he
would
behead
him
finally
the
last
day
an
old
and
trusty
servant
begged
him
so
long
that
he
told
him
the
whole
matter
and
said
i
have
not
been
able
to
count
the
stars
and
the
king
will
cut
my
head
off
this
morning
when
the
servant
had
heard
all
he
said
do
not
fear
leave
it
to
me
i
will
settle
everything
he
went
and
bought
a
large
stretched
it
on
the
ground
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
the
tail
half
an
ear
and
a
small
piece
out
of
the
side
and
then
said
to
the
abbot
now
let
us
go
to
the
king
and
when
he
asks
your
excellency
how
many
stars
there
are
in
heaven
your
excellency
will
call
me
i
will
stretch
the
hide
on
the
ground
and
your
excellency
will
say
stars
in
heaven
are
as
many
as
the
hairs
on
this
hide
and
as
there
are
more
hairs
than
stars
i
have
been
obliged
to
cut
off
part
of
the
hide
after
the
abbot
had
heard
him
he
felt
relieved
ordered
his
carriage
and
took
his
servant
to
the
king
when
the
king
saw
the
abbot
he
saluted
him
and
then
said
have
you
fulfilled
my
command
yes
your
majesty
answered
the
abbot
the
stars
are
all
counted
then
tell
me
how
many
they
are
the
abbot
called
his
servant
who
brought
the
hide
and
spread
it
on
the
ground
while
the
king
not
knowing
how
the
matter
was
going
to
end
continued
his
questioning
when
the
servant
had
stretched
out
the
hide
the
abbot
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
during
these
three
days
i
have
gone
mad
counting
the
stars
and
they
are
all
counted
in
short
how
many
are
they
your
majesty
the
stars
are
as
many
as
the
hairs
of
this
hide
and
those
that
were
in
excess
i
have
had
to
cut
off
and
they
are
so
many
hundreds
of
millions
and
if
you
do
believe
me
have
them
counted
for
i
have
brought
you
the
proof
then
the
king
remained
with
his
mouth
open
and
had
nothing
to
answer
he
only
said
go
and
live
as
long
as
noah
without
thoughts
for
your
mind
is
enough
for
you
and
so
speaking
he
dismissed
him
thanking
him
and
remaining
henceforth
his
best
friend
the
abbot
returned
home
with
his
servant
delighted
and
rejoicing
he
thanked
his
servant
made
him
his
steward
and
intimate
friend
and
gave
him
more
than
an
ounce
of
money
a
day
to
live
on
in
another
sicilian
version
referred
to
by
pitrè
vol
the
pope
instead
of
the
king
wishes
to
know
from
the
abbot
what
is
the
distance
from
heaven
to
earth
what
god
is
doing
in
heaven
what
the
pope
is
thinking
of
the
cook
disguised
as
the
abbot
answers
as
long
as
this
ball
of
thread
rewarding
the
good
and
punishing
the
wicked
he
thinks
he
is
speaking
with
the
abbot
and
on
the
contrary
is
talking
to
the
cook
the
following
story
from
venice
bernoni
no
is
a
combination
of
the
two
stories
in
grimm
clever
alice
and
the
clever
people
it
is
called
xciii
bastianelo
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
husband
and
wife
who
had
a
son
this
son
grew
up
and
said
one
day
to
his
mother
do
you
know
mother
i
would
like
to
marry
very
well
marry
whom
do
you
want
to
take
he
answered
i
want
the
gardener
daughter
she
is
a
good
girl
take
her
i
am
willing
so
he
went
and
asked
for
the
girl
and
her
parents
gave
her
to
him
they
were
married
and
when
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
dinner
the
wine
gave
out
the
husband
said
there
is
no
more
wine
the
bride
to
show
that
she
was
a
good
housekeeper
said
i
will
go
and
get
some
she
took
the
bottles
and
went
to
the
cellar
turned
the
cock
and
began
to
think
suppose
i
should
have
a
son
and
we
should
call
him
bastianelo
and
he
should
die
oh
how
grieved
i
should
be
oh
how
grieved
i
should
be
and
thereupon
she
began
to
weep
and
weep
and
meanwhile
the
wine
was
running
all
over
the
cellar
when
they
saw
that
the
bride
did
not
return
the
mother
said
i
will
go
and
see
what
the
matter
is
so
she
went
into
the
cellar
and
saw
the
bride
with
the
bottle
in
her
hand
and
weeping
while
the
wine
was
running
over
the
cellar
what
is
the
matter
with
you
that
you
are
weeping
ah
my
mother
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
had
a
son
and
should
name
him
bastianelo
and
he
should
die
oh
how
i
should
grieve
oh
how
i
should
grieve
the
mother
too
began
to
weep
and
weep
and
weep
and
meanwhile
the
wine
was
running
over
the
cellar
when
the
people
at
the
table
saw
that
no
one
brought
the
wine
the
groom
father
said
i
will
go
and
see
what
is
the
matter
certainly
something
wrong
has
happened
to
the
bride
he
went
and
saw
the
whole
cellar
full
of
wine
and
the
mother
and
bride
weeping
what
is
the
matter
he
said
has
anything
wrong
happened
to
you
no
said
the
bride
but
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
had
a
son
and
should
call
him
bastianelo
and
he
should
die
oh
how
i
should
grieve
oh
how
i
should
grieve
then
he
too
began
to
weep
and
all
three
wept
and
meanwhile
the
wine
was
running
over
the
cellar
when
the
groom
saw
that
neither
the
bride
nor
the
mother
nor
the
father
came
back
he
said
now
i
will
go
and
see
what
the
matter
is
that
no
one
returns
he
went
into
the
cellar
and
saw
all
the
wine
running
over
the
cellar
he
hastened
and
stopped
the
cask
and
then
asked
what
is
the
matter
that
you
are
all
weeping
and
have
let
the
wine
run
all
over
the
cellar
then
the
bride
said
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
had
a
son
and
called
him
bastianelo
and
he
should
die
oh
how
i
should
grieve
oh
how
i
should
grieve
then
the
groom
said
you
stupid
fools
are
you
weeping
at
this
and
letting
all
the
wine
run
into
the
cellar
have
you
nothing
else
to
think
of
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
remained
with
you
i
will
roam
about
the
world
and
until
i
find
three
fools
greater
than
you
i
will
not
return
home
he
had
a
made
took
a
bottle
of
wine
a
sausage
and
some
linen
and
made
a
bundle
which
he
put
on
a
stick
and
carried
over
his
shoulder
he
journeyed
and
journeyed
but
found
no
fool
at
last
he
said
worn
out
i
must
turn
back
for
i
see
i
can
not
find
a
greater
fool
than
my
wife
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
whether
to
go
on
or
to
turn
back
oh
he
said
it
is
better
to
try
and
go
a
little
farther
so
he
went
on
and
shortly
he
saw
a
man
in
his
at
a
well
all
wet
with
perspiration
and
water
what
are
you
doing
sir
that
you
are
so
covered
with
water
and
in
such
a
sweat
oh
let
me
alone
the
man
answered
for
i
have
been
here
a
long
time
drawing
water
to
fill
this
pail
and
i
can
not
fill
it
what
are
you
drawing
the
water
in
he
asked
him
in
this
sieve
he
said
what
are
you
thinking
about
to
draw
water
in
that
sieve
just
wait
he
went
to
a
house
near
by
and
borrowed
a
bucket
with
which
he
returned
to
the
well
and
filled
the
pail
thank
you
good
man
god
knows
how
long
i
should
have
had
to
remain
here
here
is
one
who
is
a
greater
fool
than
my
wife
he
continued
his
journey
and
after
a
time
he
saw
at
a
distance
a
man
in
his
shirt
who
was
jumping
down
from
a
tree
he
drew
near
and
saw
a
woman
under
the
same
tree
holding
a
pair
of
breeches
he
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
and
they
said
that
they
had
been
there
a
long
time
and
that
the
man
was
trying
on
those
breeches
and
did
not
know
how
to
get
into
them
i
have
jumped
and
jumped
said
the
man
until
i
am
tired
out
and
i
can
not
imagine
how
to
get
into
those
breeches
oh
said
the
traveller
you
might
stay
here
as
long
as
you
wished
for
you
would
never
get
into
them
in
this
way
come
down
and
lean
against
the
tree
then
he
took
his
legs
and
put
them
in
the
breeches
and
after
he
had
put
them
on
he
said
is
that
right
very
good
bless
you
for
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
god
knows
how
long
i
should
have
had
to
jump
then
the
traveller
said
to
himself
i
have
seen
two
greater
fools
than
my
wife
then
he
went
his
way
and
as
he
approached
a
city
he
heard
a
great
noise
when
he
drew
near
he
asked
what
it
was
and
was
told
it
was
a
marriage
and
that
it
was
the
custom
in
that
city
for
the
brides
to
enter
the
city
gate
on
horseback
and
that
there
was
a
great
discussion
on
this
occasion
between
the
groom
and
the
owner
of
the
horse
for
the
bride
was
tall
and
the
horse
high
and
they
could
not
get
through
the
gate
so
that
they
must
either
cut
off
the
bride
head
or
the
horse
legs
the
groom
did
not
wish
his
bride
head
cut
off
and
the
owner
of
the
horse
did
not
wish
his
horse
legs
cut
off
and
hence
this
disturbance
then
the
traveller
said
just
wait
and
came
up
to
the
bride
and
gave
her
a
slap
that
made
her
lower
her
head
and
then
he
gave
the
horse
a
kick
and
so
they
passed
through
the
gate
and
entered
the
city
the
groom
and
the
owner
of
the
horse
asked
the
traveller
what
he
wanted
for
he
had
saved
the
groom
his
bride
and
the
owner
of
the
horse
his
horse
he
answered
that
he
did
not
wish
anything
and
said
to
himself
two
and
one
make
three
that
is
enough
now
i
will
go
home
he
did
so
and
said
to
his
wife
here
i
am
my
wife
i
have
seen
three
greater
fools
then
you
now
let
us
remain
in
peace
and
think
about
nothing
else
they
renewed
the
wedding
and
always
remained
in
peace
after
a
time
the
wife
had
a
son
whom
they
named
bastianelo
and
bastianelo
did
not
die
but
still
lives
with
his
father
and
mother
there
is
a
sicilian
version
of
this
story
pitrè
no
called
the
peasant
of
larcàra
in
which
the
bride
mother
imagines
that
her
daughter
has
a
son
who
falls
into
the
cistern
the
groom
they
are
not
yet
married
is
disgusted
and
sets
out
on
his
travels
with
no
fixed
purpose
of
returning
if
he
finds
some
fools
greater
than
his
as
in
the
venetian
tale
the
first
fool
he
meets
is
a
mother
whose
child
in
playing
the
game
called
r
tries
to
get
his
hand
out
of
the
hole
while
his
fist
is
full
of
stones
he
can
not
of
course
and
the
mother
thinks
they
will
have
to
cut
off
his
hand
the
traveller
tells
the
child
to
drop
the
stones
and
then
he
draws
out
his
hand
easily
enough
next
he
finds
a
bride
who
can
not
enter
the
church
because
she
is
very
tall
and
wears
a
high
comb
the
difficulty
is
settled
as
in
the
former
story
footnote
r
a
game
played
with
which
are
thrown
into
holes
made
in
the
ground
and
to
which
certain
numbers
are
attached
after
a
while
he
comes
to
a
woman
who
is
spinning
and
drops
her
spindle
she
calls
out
to
the
pig
whose
name
is
tony
to
pick
it
up
for
her
the
pig
does
nothing
but
grunt
and
the
woman
in
anger
cries
well
you
wo
pick
it
up
may
your
mother
die
the
traveller
who
had
overheard
all
this
takes
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
folds
up
like
a
letter
and
then
knocks
at
the
door
who
is
there
open
the
door
for
i
have
a
letter
for
you
from
tony
mother
who
is
ill
and
wishes
to
see
her
son
before
she
dies
the
woman
wonders
that
her
imprecation
has
taken
effect
so
soon
and
readily
consents
to
visit
not
only
this
but
she
loads
a
mule
with
everything
necessary
for
the
comfort
of
the
body
and
soul
of
the
dying
pig
the
traveller
leads
away
the
mule
with
tony
and
returns
home
so
pleased
with
having
found
that
the
outside
world
contains
so
many
fools
that
he
marries
as
he
had
first
intended
the
credulity
of
the
woman
in
the
last
version
in
allowing
tony
to
visit
his
sick
mother
finds
a
parallel
in
a
neapolitan
story
imbriani
called
xciv
christmas
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
husband
who
had
a
wife
who
was
a
little
foolish
one
day
he
said
to
her
come
put
the
house
in
order
for
christmas
is
coming
as
soon
as
he
left
the
house
his
wife
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
asked
every
one
who
passed
if
his
name
was
christmas
all
said
no
but
finally
one
to
see
why
she
asked
said
yes
then
she
made
him
come
in
and
gave
him
everything
that
she
had
in
order
to
clean
out
the
house
when
her
husband
returned
he
asked
her
what
she
had
done
with
things
she
responded
that
she
had
given
them
to
christmas
as
he
had
ordered
her
husband
was
so
enraged
at
what
he
heard
that
he
seized
her
and
gave
her
a
good
beating
another
time
she
asked
her
husband
when
he
was
going
to
kill
the
pig
he
answered
at
christmas
the
wife
did
as
before
and
when
she
spied
the
man
called
christmas
she
called
him
and
gave
him
the
pig
which
she
had
adorned
with
her
earrings
and
necklace
saying
that
her
husband
had
so
commanded
her
when
her
husband
returned
and
learned
what
she
had
done
he
gave
her
a
sound
thrashing
and
from
that
time
he
learned
to
say
nothing
more
to
his
wife
in
the
sicilian
version
pitrè
no
long
may
s
the
wife
who
is
very
anxious
to
make
more
room
in
her
house
by
getting
rid
of
the
grain
stored
in
it
asks
her
husband
when
they
shall
clean
out
the
house
he
answers
when
long
may
comes
the
wife
asks
the
if
they
are
long
may
and
at
last
a
swindler
says
he
is
and
receives
as
a
gift
all
the
grain
the
swindler
was
a
potter
and
the
woman
told
him
that
he
ought
to
give
her
a
load
of
pots
he
did
so
and
the
wife
knocked
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
each
and
strung
them
on
a
rope
stretched
across
the
room
it
is
needless
to
say
that
when
the
husband
returned
the
wife
received
a
beating
that
left
her
more
dead
than
alive

there
is
a
sicilian
phrase
long
as
the
month
of
may
to
indicate
what
is
very
long
another
story
about
foolish
people
is
the
following
venetian
tale
bernoni
xiii
entitled
xcv
the
wager
there
was
once
a
husband
and
a
wife
the
former
said
one
day
to
the
latter
let
us
have
some
fritters
she
replied
what
shall
we
do
for
a
go
and
borrow
one
from
my
godmother
you
go
and
get
it
it
is
only
a
little
way
off
go
yourself
i
will
take
it
back
when
we
are
done
with
it
so
she
went
and
borrowed
the
pan
and
when
she
returned
said
to
her
husband
here
is
the
pan
but
you
must
carry
it
back
so
they
cooked
the
fritters
and
after
they
had
eaten
the
husband
said
now
let
us
go
to
work
both
of
us
and
the
one
who
speaks
first
shall
carry
back
the
pan
then
she
began
to
spin
and
he
to
draw
his
thread
for
he
was
a
shoemaker
and
all
the
time
keeping
silence
except
that
when
he
drew
his
thread
he
said
and
she
spinning
answered
picicì
and
they
said
not
another
word
now
there
happened
to
pass
that
way
a
soldier
with
a
horse
and
he
asked
a
woman
if
there
was
any
shoemaker
in
that
street
she
said
that
there
was
one
near
by
and
took
him
to
the
house
the
soldier
asked
the
shoemaker
to
come
and
cut
his
horse
a
girth
and
he
would
pay
him
the
latter
made
no
answer
but
and
his
wife
picicì
then
the
soldier
said
come
and
cut
my
horse
a
girth
or
i
will
cut
your
head
off
the
shoemaker
only
answered
and
his
wife
picicì
then
the
soldier
began
to
grow
angry
and
seized
his
sword
and
said
to
the
shoemaker
either
come
and
cut
my
horse
a
girth
or
i
will
cut
your
head
off
but
to
no
purpose
the
shoemaker
did
not
wish
to
be
the
first
one
to
speak
and
only
replied
and
his
wife
picicì
then
the
soldier
got
mad
in
good
earnest
seized
the
shoemaker
head
and
was
going
to
cut
it
off
when
his
wife
saw
that
she
cried
out
ah
do
for
mercy
sake
good
exclaimed
her
husband
good
now
you
go
and
carry
the
pan
back
to
my
godmother
and
i
will
go
and
cut
the
horse
girth
and
so
he
did
and
won
the
wager
in
a
sicilian
story
with
the
same
title
pitrè
no
the
husband
and
wife
fry
some
fish
and
then
set
about
their
respective
work
shoemaking
and
spinning
and
the
one
who
finishes
first
the
piece
of
work
begun
is
to
eat
the
fish
while
they
were
singing
and
whistling
at
their
work
a
friend
comes
along
who
knocks
at
the
door
but
receives
no
answer
then
he
enters
and
speaks
to
them
but
still
no
reply
finally
in
anger
he
sits
down
at
the
table
and
eats
up
all
the
fish
himself
one
of
our
most
popular
stories
illustrating
woman
obstinacy
is
found
everywhere
in
italy
the
following
is
the
sicilian
version
xcvi
scissors
they
were
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
husband
and
a
wife
the
husband
was
a
tailor
so
was
the
wife
and
in
addition
was
a
good
housekeeper
one
day
the
husband
found
some
things
in
the
kitchen
broken
pots
glasses
plates
he
asked
how
were
they
broken
how
do
i
know
answered
the
wife
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
do
i
know
who
broke
them
who
broke
them
i
with
the
scissors
said
the
wife
in
anger
with
the
scissors
with
the
scissors
are
you
telling
the
truth
i
want
to
know
what
you
broke
them
with
if
you
do
tell
me
i
will
beat
you
with
the
scissors
for
she
had
the
scissors
in
her
hand
scissors
do
you
say
scissors
they
were
ah
what
do
you
mean
wait
a
bit
i
will
make
you
see
whether
it
was
you
with
the
scissors
so
he
tied
a
rope
around
her
and
began
to
lower
her
into
the
well
saying
come
how
did
you
break
them
you
see
i
am
lowering
you
into
the
well
it
was
the
scissors
the
husband
seeing
her
so
obstinate
lowered
her
into
the
well
and
she
for
all
that
did
not
hold
her
tongue
how
did
you
break
them
said
the
husband
it
was
the
scissors
then
her
husband
lowered
her
more
until
she
was
half
way
down
what
did
you
do
it
with
it
was
the
scissors
then
he
lowered
her
until
her
feet
touched
the
water
what
did
you
do
it
with
it
was
the
scissors
then
he
let
her
down
into
the
water
to
her
waist
what
did
you
do
it
with
it
was
the
scissors
take
care
cried
her
husband
enraged
at
seeing
her
so
obstinate
it
will
take
but
little
to
put
you
under
the
water
you
had
better
tell
what
you
did
it
with
it
will
be
better
for
you
how
is
it
possible
to
break
pots
and
dishes
with
the
scissors
what
has
become
of
the
pieces
if
they
were
cut
it
was
the
scissors
the
scissors
then
he
let
go
the
rope
splash
his
wife
is
all
under
the
water
are
you
satisfied
now
do
you
say
any
longer
that
it
was
with
the
scissors
the
wife
could
not
speak
any
more
for
she
was
under
the
water
but
what
did
she
do
she
stuck
her
hand
up
out
of
the
water
and
with
her
fingers
began
to
make
signs
as
if
she
were
cutting
with
the
scissors
what
could
the
poor
husband
do
he
said
i
am
losing
my
wife
and
then
i
shall
have
to
go
after
her
i
will
pull
her
out
now
and
she
may
say
that
it
was
the
scissors
or
the
shears
then
he
pulled
her
out
and
there
was
no
way
of
making
her
tell
with
what
she
had
broken
all
those
things
in
the
kitchen
another
familiar
story
is
xcvii
the
doctor
apprentice
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
doctor
who
took
his
apprentice
with
him
when
he
made
his
visits
one
day
while
visiting
a
patient
the
doctor
said
why
do
you
not
listen
to
my
orders
that
you
are
not
to
eat
anything
the
invalid
said
sir
i
assure
you
that
i
have
eaten
nothing
that
is
not
true
answered
the
doctor
for
i
have
found
your
pulse
beating
like
that
of
a
person
who
has
eaten
grapes
the
patient
convicted
said
it
is
true
that
i
have
eaten
some
grapes
but
it
was
only
a
little
bunch
very
well
do
not
risk
eating
again
and
do
think
you
can
fool
me
the
poor
apprentice
who
was
with
the
doctor
was
amazed
to
see
how
his
master
guessed
from
the
pulse
that
his
patient
had
eaten
grapes
and
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
house
he
asked
master
how
did
you
perceive
that
he
had
eaten
grapes
listen
said
the
doctor
a
person
who
visits
the
sick
must
never
pass
for
a
fool
as
soon
as
you
enter
cast
your
eyes
on
the
bed
and
under
the
bed
too
and
from
the
crumbs
that
you
see
you
can
guess
what
the
patient
has
eaten
i
saw
the
stalk
of
the
grapes
and
from
that
i
inferred
that
he
had
eaten
grapes
the
next
day
there
were
many
patients
in
the
town
and
the
doctor
not
being
able
to
visit
them
all
sent
his
apprentice
to
visit
a
few
among
others
the
apprentice
went
to
see
the
man
who
had
eaten
the
grapes
and
wishing
to
play
the
part
of
an
expert
like
his
master
to
show
that
he
was
a
skilful
physician
when
he
perceived
that
there
were
bits
of
straw
under
the
bed
said
angrily
will
you
not
understand
that
you
must
not
eat
the
invalid
said
i
assure
you
that
i
have
not
even
tasted
a
drop
of
water
yes
sir
you
have
answered
the
apprentice
you
have
been
eating
straw
for
i
see
the
bits
under
the
bed
the
sick
man
replied
at
once
do
you
take
me
for
an
ass
like
yourself
and
so
the
apprentice
cut
the
figure
of
the
fool
that
he
was
there
are
two
figures
in
sicilian
around
whom
many
jokes
have
gathered
which
are
in
other
parts
of
italy
told
of
some
nameless
person
or
attributed
to
the
continental
counterparts
of
the
insular
heroes
these
two
are
firrazzanu
and
giufà
the
former
is
the
practical
joker
the
second
the
typical
booby
found
in
the
popular
literature
of
all
peoples
the
following
stories
of
firrazzanu
unless
otherwise
indicated
are
from
pitrè
no
xcviii
firrazzanu
wife
and
the
queen
firrazzanu
was
the
valet
of
a
prince
in
palermo
on
whom
he
also
played
his
tricks
but
as
firrazzanu
was
known
and
everybody
was
amused
by
him
the
prince
overlooked
them
the
queen
was
once
in
palermo
and
wished
to
know
firrazzanu
he
went
to
see
her
and
amused
her
somewhat
the
queen
said
are
you
married
or
single
married
your
majesty
i
wish
to
make
your
acquaintance
how
can
that
be
your
majesty
for
my
wife
is
deaf
firrazzanu
made
this
up
out
of
his
own
head
for
it
was
not
true
no
matter
when
i
speak
with
her
i
will
scream
go
have
your
wife
come
here
firrazzanu
went
home
fanny
the
queen
wants
to
know
you
but
you
must
remember
that
she
is
a
little
hard
of
hearing
and
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
her
you
must
raise
your
voice
very
well
said
his
wife
let
us
go
when
they
arrived
at
the
palace
she
said
to
the
queen
in
a
loud
voice
at
your
majesty
feet
the
queen
said
to
herself
you
see
because
she
is
deaf
she
screams
as
if
everybody
else
were
deaf
then
she
said
to
her
loudly
good
day
my
friend
how
do
you
do
very
well
your
majesty
answered
wife
still
louder
the
queen
to
make
herself
heard
raised
her
voice
and
screamed
also
and
fanny
for
her
part
cried
out
louder
and
louder
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
quarrelling
firrazzanu
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
began
to
laugh
so
that
the
queen
perceived
the
joke
and
if
firrazzanu
had
not
run
away
perhaps
she
would
have
had
him
arrested
and
who
knows
how
the
matter
had
ended
the
second
story
the
tailor
who
twisted
his
mouth
has
already
been
mentioned
in
chapter
iii
on
one
occasion
no
the
viceroy
gave
a
feast
and
needed
some
partridges
now
the
word
means
both
partridge
and
humpback
so
firrazzanu
said
he
would
get
the
viceroy
as
many
as
he
wanted
although
they
were
very
scarce
the
viceroy
said
twenty
would
do
firrazzanu
then
collected
a
score
of
humpbacks
and
introduced
them
into
the
viceroy
kitchen
sending
word
to
the
viceroy
that
the
were
ready
his
excellency
wished
to
see
them
and
firrazzanu
led
his
troop
to
his
apartment
when
they
were
all
in
firrazzanu
said
here
they
are
the
viceroy
looked
around
and
said
where
here
you
wanted
and
these
are
the
viceroy
laughed
gave
each
of
the
humpbacks
a
present
and
dismissed
them
another
time
while
the
prince
was
at
dinner
firrazzanu
led
a
number
of
asses
under
his
window
and
made
them
bray
so
that
the
poor
prince
was
driven
almost
to
distraction
the
author
of
the
joke
as
usual
took
to
his
heels
and
escaped
once
a
very
wealthy
prince
having
a
great
number
of
rents
to
collect
and
not
succeeding
thought
of
making
firrazzanu
collector
here
said
he
to
him
take
my
authority
and
collect
for
me
and
i
will
give
you
twenty
per
cent
firrazzanu
went
into
the
places
where
the
rents
were
to
be
collected
and
called
together
all
the
debtors
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
he
made
them
pay
his
share
that
is
twenty
per
and
nothing
more
the
rest
he
said
you
can
pay
another
year
to
the
prince
now
you
may
depart
then
he
went
back
to
the
prince
what
have
you
done
firrazzanu
have
you
collected
all
the
rents
what
are
you
talking
about
collecting
i
had
hard
work
to
collect
my
share
what
do
you
mean
i
collected
with
difficulty
the
twenty
per
cent
that
belonged
to
me
your
share
will
be
paid
next
year
the
prince
was
obliged
to
laugh
at
last
and
firrazzanu
went
away
happy
and
satisfied
another
time
the
prince
went
hunting
and
ordered
firrazzanu
when
it
was
convenient
to
tell
the
princess
that
he
should
not
be
home
to
dinner
that
day
firrazzanu
did
not
find
it
convenient
to
deliver
the
message
for
a
week
when
he
said
that
the
prince
would
not
be
home
to
dine
that
day
on
the
first
occasion
of
course
the
princess
waited
for
her
husband
in
great
anxiety
until
midnight
on
the
second
she
went
out
to
pay
visits
and
when
the
prince
returned
he
found
his
wife
out
and
no
dinner
prepared
firrazzanu
when
scolded
excused
himself
by
saying
that
the
prince
told
him
to
deliver
the
message
when
convenient
this
recalls
the
story
in
straparola
xiii
where
a
master
orders
his
lazy
servant
to
go
to
market
and
buy
some
meat
and
says
to
him
sarcastically
go
and
stay
a
year
which
command
the
servant
obeys
to
the
letter
the
viceroy
at
last
angry
at
one
of
firrazzanu
jokes
banished
him
to
the
town
of
murriali
when
firrazzanu
grew
tired
of
the
place
he
had
a
cart
filled
with
the
earth
of
the
town
and
rode
into
palermo
on
it
the
viceroy
had
him
arrested
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
but
firrazzanu
protested
that
he
had
not
broken
the
viceroy
command
for
he
was
still
on
the
earth
of
murriali
the
same
story
is
told
of
gonnella
the
italian
counterpart
of
firrazzanu
by
sacchetti
and
bandello
iv
the
prince
desired
once
to
give
firrazzanu
a
lesson
that
would
correct
him
of
his
fondness
for
jokes
so
he
told
the
commandant
of
the
castle
that
he
would
send
him
one
day
a
servant
of
his
with
a
letter
and
that
he
the
commandant
should
carry
out
the
orders
contained
in
it
a
week
after
the
prince
called
firrazzanu
and
said
go
to
the
commandant
of
the
castle
and
ask
him
to
give
you
what
this
letter
says
firrazzanu
went
turning
over
the
letter
and
in
doubt
about
the
matter
just
then
he
met
another
servant
and
said
to
him
carry
this
letter
for
me
to
the
commandant
of
the
castle
and
tell
him
to
give
you
what
he
has
to
give
you
when
you
return
we
will
have
a
good
drink
of
wine
the
servant
went
and
delivered
the
letter
to
the
commandant
who
opened
it
and
read
the
commandant
will
give
my
servant
who
is
a
rascal
a
hundred
lashes
and
then
send
him
back
to
me
the
order
was
carried
out
and
the
poor
servant
returned
to
the
palace
more
dead
than
alive
when
firrazzanu
saw
him
he
burst
out
laughing
and
said
my
brother
for
me
and
for
you
better
you
than
me
this
story
is
told
in
gonzenbach
no
as
the
way
in
which
the
queen
tried
to
punish
firrazzanu
for
the
joke
he
played
on
her
by
telling
her
his
wife
was
deaf
there
are
other
stories
told
of
firrazzanu
but
they
do
not
deserve
a
place
here
and
we
can
direct
our
attention
at
once
to
giufà
the
typical
booby
who
appears
in
the
various
provinces
of
italy
under
different
names
the
first
story
told
of
him
in
pitrè
collection
no
is
xcix
giufà
and
the
plaster
statue
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
very
poor
woman
who
had
a
son
called
giufà
who
was
stupid
lazy
and
cunning
his
mother
had
a
piece
of
cloth
and
said
one
day
to
giufà
take
this
cloth
and
go
and
sell
it
in
a
distant
town
and
take
care
to
sell
it
to
those
who
talk
little
so
giufà
set
out
with
the
cloth
on
his
shoulder
when
he
came
to
a
town
he
began
to
cry
who
wants
cloth
the
people
called
him
and
began
to
talk
a
great
deal
one
thought
it
coarse
another
dear
giufà
thought
they
talked
too
much
and
would
not
sell
it
to
them
after
walking
a
long
way
he
entered
a
where
he
found
nothing
but
a
plaster
image
giufà
said
to
it
do
you
want
to
buy
the
cloth
the
statue
said
not
a
word
and
giufà
seeing
that
it
spoke
little
said
now
i
must
sell
you
the
cloth
for
you
speak
little
and
he
took
the
cloth
and
hung
it
on
the
statue
and
went
away
saying
i
will
come
for
the
money
the
next
day
he
went
after
the
money
and
found
the
cloth
gone
give
me
the
money
for
the
cloth
the
statue
said
nothing
since
you
will
not
give
me
the
money
i
will
show
you
who
i
am
and
he
borrowed
a
mattock
and
struck
the
statue
until
he
overthrew
it
and
inside
of
it
he
found
a
jar
of
money
he
put
the
money
in
a
bag
and
went
home
to
his
mother
and
told
her
that
he
had
sold
the
cloth
to
a
person
who
did
not
speak
and
gave
him
no
money
that
he
had
killed
him
with
a
mattock
and
thrown
him
down
and
he
had
given
him
the
money
which
he
had
brought
home
his
mother
who
was
wise
said
to
him
say
nothing
about
it
and
we
will
eat
this
money
up
little
by

another
time
his
mother
said
to
him
giufà

piece
of
cloth
to
be
dyed
take
it
and
leave
it
with
the
dyer
the
one
who
dyes
green
and
black
giufà
put
it
on
his
shoulder
and
went
off
on
his
way
he
saw
a
large
beautiful
snake
and
because
it
was
green
he
said
to
it
my
mother
has
sent
me
with
this
cloth
which
she
wants
dyed
i
will
come
for
it
and
there
he
left
it
he
went
home
and
told
his
mother
who
began
to
tear
her
hair
ah
shameless
fellow
how
you
ruin
me
hasten
and
see
whether
it
is
there
still
giufà
went
back
but
the
cloth
had
disappeared
giufà
and
the
judge
one
day
giufà
went
out
to
gather
herbs
and
it
was
night
before
he
returned
on
his
way
back
the
moon
rose
through
the
clouds
and
giufà
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
watched
the
moon
appear
and
disappear
behind
the
clouds
and
he
exclaimed
constantly
it
appears
it
appears
it
sets
it
sets
now
there
were
near
the
way
some
thieves
who
were
skinning
a
calf
which
they
had
stolen
and
when
they
heard
it
appears
it
sets
they
feared
that
the
officers
of
justice
were
coming
so
they
ran
away
and
left
the
meat
when
giufà
saw
the
thieves
running
away
he
went
to
see
what
it
was
and
found
the
calf
skinned
he
took
his
knife
and
cut
off
flesh
enough
to
fill
his
sack
and
went
home
when
he
arrived
there
his
mother
asked
him
why
he
came
so
late
he
said
it
was
because
he
was
bringing
some
meat
which
she
was
to
sell
the
next
day
and
the
money
was
to
be
kept
for
him
the
next
day
his
mother
sent
him
into
the
country
and
sold
the
meat
in
the
evening
giufà
returned
and
asked
his
mother
did
you
sell
the
meat
yes
i
sold
it
to
the
flies
on
credit
when
will
they
give
you
the
money
when
they
get
it
a
week
passed
and
the
flies
brought
no
money
so
giufà
went
to
the
judge
and
said
to
him
sir
i
want
justice
i
sold
the
flies
meat
on
credit
and
they
have
not
come
to
pay
me
the
judge
said
i
pronounce
this
sentence
on
them
wherever
you
see
them
you
may
kill
them
just
then
a
fly
lighted
on
the
judge
nose
and
giufà
dealt
it
such
a
blow
that
he
broke
the
judge
head

the
latter
part
of
the
story
is
found
independently

a
version
from

the
flies
plagued
giufà
and
stung
him
he
went
to
the
judge
and
complained
of
them
the
judge
laughed
and
said
you
see
a
fly
you
can
strike
it
while
the
judge
was
speaking
a
fly
rested
on
his
face
and
giufà
dealt
it
such
a
blow
that
he
broke
the

viii
one
morning
before
giufà
was
up
he
heard
a
whistle
and
asked
his
mother
who
was
passing
she
answered
that
it
was
the
one
day
giufà
tired
of
the
noise
went
out
and
killed
the
man
who
was
blowing
the
whistle
and
came
back
and
told
his
mother
that
he
had
killed
the
his
mother
went
out
and
brought
the
body
into
the
house
and
threw
it
into
the
well
which
happened
to
be
dry
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
a
lamb
which
she
killed
and
also
threw
in
the
well
meanwhile
the
family
of
the
murdered
man
had
learned
of
the
murder
and
had
gone
to
the
judge
with
their
complaint
and
all
together
went
to
giufà
house
to
investigate
the
matter
the
judge
said
to
giufà
where
did
you
put
the
body
giufà
who
was
silly
replied
i
threw
it
in
the
well
then
they
tied
giufà
to
a
rope
and
lowered
him
into
the
well
when
he
reached
the
bottom
he
began
to
feel
around
and
touched
wool
and
cried
out
to
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
did
your
father
have
wool
my
father
did
not
have
wool
this
one
has
wool
he
is
not
your
father
then
he
touched
the
tail
did
your
father
have
a
tail
my
father
did
not
have
a
tail
then
it
not
your
father
then
he
felt
four
feet
and
asked
how
many
feet
did
your
father
have
my
father
had
two
feet
giufà
said
this
one
has
four
feet
he
is
not
your
father
then
he
felt
the
head
and
said
did
your
father
have
horns
my
father
did
not
have
horns
giufà
replied
this
one
has
horns
he
is
not
your
father
then
the
judge
said
giufà
bring
him
up
either
with
the
horns
or
with
the
wool
so
they
drew
up
giufà
with
the
lamb
on
his
shoulder
and
when
the
judge
saw
that
it
was
a
real
lamb
they
set
giufà
at
liberty
in
a
variant
of
the
above
story
giufà
mother
to
get
rid
of
him
one
day
tells
him
to
take
his
gun
and
go
off
and
shoot
a
giufà
asks
what
a
cardinal
is
and
his
mother
tells
him
that
it
is
one
that
has
a
red
head
giufà
of
course
shoots
a
cardinal
and
carries
him
home
the
remainder
of
the
story
is
as
above
in
another
variant
mother
has
a
cock
which
she
cooks
one
day
and
giufà
who
had
never
eaten
anything
of
the
kind
before
likes
it
greatly
and
asks
what
it
is
his
mother
tells
him
it
is
the
one
evening
giufà
saw
a
poor
man
singing
behind
a
door
and
thinking
he
was
a
killed
him
and
carried
him
home
the
rest
of
the
story
is
like
the
first
version
giufà
is
not
without
an
occasional
gleam
of
wit
as
is
shown
in
the
following
story
pitrè
no
entitled
cii
eat
my
clothes
as
giufà
was
half
a
simpleton
no
one
showed
him
any
kindness
such
as
to
invite
him
to
his
house
or
give
him
anything
to
eat
once
giufà
went
to
a
for
something
and
the
farmers
when
they
saw
him
looking
so
ragged
and
poor
came
near
setting
the
dogs
on
him
and
made
him
leave
in
a
hurry
when
his
mother
heard
it
she
procured
for
him
a
fine
coat
a
pair
of
breeches
and
a
velvet
vest
giufà
dressed
up
like
an
overseer
went
to
the
same
and
then
you
should
see
what
great
ceremonies
they
made
they
invited
him
to
dine
with
them
while
at
the
table
all
were
very
attentive
to
him
giufà
on
the
one
hand
filled
his
stomach
and
on
the
other
put
into
his
pockets
coat
and
hat
whatever
was
left
over
saying
eat
my
clothes
for
you
were
invited
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
story
is
told
of
no
less
a
person
than
dante
about
whom
cluster
more
popular
traditions
than
many
are
aware
of
it
is
the
subject
of
one
of
sercambi
novels
and
will
be
found
with
many
other
interesting
traditions
of
the
great
poet
in
papanti
secondo
la
tradizione
e
i
leghorn
giufà
was
not
a
very
safe
person
to
leave
alone
in
the
house
once
his
mother
went
to
church
and
told
him
to
make
some
porridge
for
his
little
sister
giufà
made
a
great
kettle
of
boiling
porridge
and
fed
it
to
the
poor
child
and
burned
her
mouth
so
that
she
died
on
another
occasion
his
mother
on
leaving
home
told
him
to
feed
the
hen
that
was
sitting
and
put
her
back
on
the
nest
so
that
the
eggs
should
not
get
cold
giufà
stuffed
the
hen
with
the
food
until
he
killed
her
and
then
sat
on
the
eggs
himself
until
his
mother
returned
giufà
mother
went
to
mass
once
and
said
to
him
pull
the
door
to
when
his
mother
had
gone
out
giufà
took
hold
of
the
door
and
began
to
pull
it
and
pulled
and
pulled
until
it
came
off
giufà
put
it
on
his
back
and
carried
it
to
the
church
and
threw
it
down
before
his
mother
saying
there
is
the
door
a
number
of
other
stories
about
giufà
are
found
in
gonzenbach
no
which
we
give
here
for
completeness
ciii
giufà
exploits
after
giufà
had
scalded
his
little
sister
to
death
his
mother
drove
him
from
the
house
and
he
entered
the
service
of
a
priest
what
wages
do
you
want
asked
the
priest
one
egg
a
day
and
as
much
bread
as
i
can
eat
with
it
and
you
must
keep
me
in
your
service
until
the
cries
in
the
ivy
the
priest
was
satisfied
and
thought
he
could
not
find
such
a
cheap
servant
again
the
next
morning
giufà
received
his
egg
and
a
loaf
of
bread
he
opened
the
egg
and
ate
it
with
a
pin
and
every
time
he
licked
off
the
pin
he
ate
a
great
piece
of
bread
bring
me
a
little
more
bread
he
cried
this
is
not
enough
and
the
priest
had
to
get
him
a
large
basket
of
bread
so
it
was
every
morning
alas
for
me
cried
the
priest
in
a
few
weeks
he
will
reduce
me
to
beggary
it
was
winter
then
and
would
be
several
months
until
the
cried
in
the
ivy
in
despair
the
priest
said
to
his
mother
this
evening
you
must
hide
in
the
ivy
and
scream
like
an
owl
the
old
woman
did
as
she
was
told
and
began
to
cry
miu
miu
do
you
hear
giufà
said
the
priest
the
is
crying
in
the
ivy
we
must
part
so
giufà
took
his
bundle
and
was
going
to
return
to
his
mother
as
he
was
going
by
the
place
where
the
priest
mother
was
still
crying
miu
miu
he
exclaimed
o
you
cursed
suffer
punishment
and
sorrow
and
threw
stones
into
the
ivy
and
killed
the
old
woman
giufà
mother
would
not
allow
him
to
remain
at
home
and
made
him
take
service
as
a
swineherd
with
a
farmer
who
sent
him
into
the
woods
to
keep
the
swine
until
they
were
fat
and
then
drive
them
back
so
giufà
lived
several
months
in
the
woods
until
the
swine
were
fat
as
he
was
driving
them
home
he
met
a
butcher
and
said
to
him
would
you
like
to
buy
these
swine
i
will
sell
them
to
you
at
half
price
if
you
will
give
me
back
the
ears
and
tails
the
butcher
bought
the
whole
herd
and
paid
giufà
the
money
together
with
the
ears
and
tails
giufà
then
went
to
a
bog
near
by
and
planted
two
ears
close
together
and
three
spans
off
a
tail
and
so
with
all
of
them
then
he
ran
in
great
trouble
to
the
farmer
and
cried
sir
imagine
what
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
to
me
i
had
fattened
your
swine
beautifully
and
was
driving
them
home
when
they
fell
into
a
bog
and
are
all
swallowed
up
in
it
the
ears
and
tails
only
are
still
sticking
out
the
farmer
hastened
with
all
his
people
to
the
bog
where
the
ears
and
tails
still
stuck
out
they
tried
to
pull
the
swine
out
but
whenever
they
seized
an
ear
or
a
tail
it
came
right
off
and
giufà
exclaimed
you
see
how
fat
the
swine
were
they
have
disappeared
in
the
marsh
from
pure
fatness
the
farmer
was
obliged
to
return
home
without
his
swine
while
giufà
took
the
money
home
to
his
mother
and
remained
a
time
with
her
one
day
his
mother
said
to
him
giufà
we
have
nothing
to
eat
what
shall
we
do
leave
it
to
me
said
he
and
went
to
a
butcher
gossip
give
me
half
a
of
meat
i
will
give
you
the
money
the
butcher
gave
him
the
meat
and
he
went
in
the
same
way
to
the
baker
the
the
and
the
and
took
home
to
his
mother
the
meat
macaroni
bread
oil
wine
and
cheese
which
he
had
bought
on
credit
and
they
ate
together
merrily
the
next
day
giufà
pretended
he
was
dead
and
his
mother
wept
and
lamented
my
son
is
dead
my
son
is
dead
he
was
put
in
an
open
coffin
and
carried
to
the
church
and
the
priests
sang
the
mass
for
the
dead
over
him
when
however
every
one
in
the
city
heard
that
giufà
was
dead
the
butcher
the
baker
the
and
the
said
what
we
gave
him
yesterday
is
as
good
as
lost
who
will
pay
us
for
it
now
the
however
thought
giufà
it
is
true
owes
me
only
four
t
but
i
will
not
give
them
to
him
i
will
go
and
take
his
cap
from
him
so
he
crept
into
the
church
but
there
was
still
a
priest
there
praying
over
giufà
coffin
as
long
as
the
priest
is
there
it
is
not
fitting
for
me
to
take
his
cap
thought
the
and
hid
himself
behind
the
altar
when
it
was
night
the
last
priest
departed
and
the
was
on
the
point
of
coming
out
from
his
when
a
band
of
thieves
rushed
into
the
church
they
had
stolen
a
large
bag
of
money
and
were
going
to
divide
it
in
the
dark
church
they
quarrelled
over
the
division
and
began
to
cry
out
and
make
a
noise
thereupon
giufà
sat
up
in
his
coffin
and
exclaimed
out
with
you
the
thieves
were
greatly
frightened
when
the
dead
man
rose
up
and
believed
he
was
calling
to
the
other
dead
so
they
ran
out
in
terror
leaving
the
sack
behind
as
giufà
was
picking
up
the
sack
the
sprang
from
his
and
claimed
his
share
of
the
money
giufà
however
kept
crying
your
share
is
four
the
thieves
outside
thought
he
was
dividing
the
money
among
the
dead
and
said
to
each
other
how
many
he
must
have
called
if
they
receive
but
four
apiece
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
run
giufà
took
the
money
home
to
his
mother
after
he
had
given
the
a
little
to
say
nothing
about
what
had
happened
footnote
t
about
a
cent
and
a
half
giufà
mother
once
bought
a
large
stock
of
flax
and
said
to
her
son
giufà
you
can
surely
spin
a
little
so
as
to
be
doing
something
giufà
took
a
skein
from
time
to
time
and
instead
of
spinning
it
put
it
in
the
fire
and
burned
it
then
his
mother
became
angry
and
beat
him
what
did
giufà
do
then
he
took
a
bundle
of
twigs
and
wound
it
with
flax
like
a
distaff
then
he
took
a
broom
for
a
spindle
and
sat
himself
on
the
roof
and
began
to
spin
while
he
was
sitting
there
three
fairies
came
by
and
said
just
see
how
nicely
giufà
is
sitting
there
and
spinning
shall
we
not
give
him
something
the
first
fairy
said
i
will
enable
him
to
spin
as
much
flax
in
a
night
as
he
touches
the
second
said
i
will
enable
him
to
weave
in
a
night
as
much
yarn
as
he
has
spun
the
third
said
i
will
enable
him
to
bleach
all
the
linen
he
has
woven
in
one
night
giufà
heard
this
and
at
night
when
his
mother
had
gone
to
bed
he
got
behind
her
stock
of
flax
and
as
often
as
he
touched
a
skein
it
was
at
once
spun
when
the
flax
was
all
gone
he
began
to
weave
and
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
loom
the
linen
began
to
roll
from
it
finally
he
spread
the
linen
out
and
had
scarcely
wet
it
a
little
when
it
was
bleached
the
next
morning
giufà
showed
his
mother
the
fine
pieces
of
linen
and
she
sold
them
and
earned
much
money
giufà
continued
this
for
several
nights
finally
he
grew
tired
and
wanted
to
go
out
to
service
again
he
found
a
place
with
a
smith
whose
bellows
he
was
to
blow
he
blew
them
so
hard
however
that
he
put
the
fire
out
the
smith
said
leave
off
blowing
and
hammer
the
iron
on
the
anvil
but
giufà
pounded
on
the
anvil
so
hard
that
the
iron
flew
into
a
thousand
pieces
then
the
smith
became
angry
but
he
could
not
send
him
away
for
he
had
agreed
to
keep
him
a
year
so
he
went
to
a
poor
man
and
said
i
will
make
you
a
handsome
present
if
you
will
tell
giufà
that
you
are
death
and
that
you
have
come
to
take
him
away
the
poor
man
met
giufà
one
day
and
said
what
the
smith
had
told
him
giufà
was
not
slow
what
are
you
death
cried
he
seized
the
poor
man
put
him
in
his
sack
and
carried
him
to
the
smithy
there
he
laid
him
on
the
anvil
and
began
to
hammer
away
on
him
how
many
years
shall
i
yet
live
he
asked
while
he
was
hammering
twenty
years
cried
the
man
in
the
sack
that
is
not
near
enough
thirty
years
forty
years
as
long
as
you
will
screamed
the
man
but
giufà
kept
on
hammering
until
the
poor
man
was
dead
the
bishop
once
announced
to
the
whole
town
that
every
goldsmith
should
make
him
a
crucifix
and
he
would
pay
four
hundred
ounces
for
the
most
beautiful
one
whoever
brought
a
crucifix
that
did
not
please
him
must
lose
his
head
so
a
goldsmith
came
and
brought
him
a
handsome
crucifix
but
the
bishop
said
it
did
not
please
him
and
had
the
poor
man
head
cut
off
but
kept
the
crucifix
the
next
day
a
second
goldsmith
came
who
brought
a
still
handsomer
crucifix
but
it
went
no
better
with
him
than
with
the
first
this
lasted
for
some
time
and
many
a
poor
man
lost
his
head
when
giufà
heard
of
this
he
went
to
a
goldsmith
and
said
master
you
must
make
me
a
crucifix
with
a
very
thick
body
but
otherwise
as
fine
as
you
can
make
it
when
the
crucifix
was
done
giufà
took
it
on
his
arm
and
carried
it
to
the
bishop
scarcely
had
the
bishop
seen
it
when
he
cried
out
what
are
you
thinking
of
to
bring
me
such
a
monster
wait
you
shall
pay
me
for
it
ah
worthy
sir
said
giufà
just
hear
me
and
learn
what
has
happened
to
me
this
crucifix
was
a
model
of
beauty
when
i
started
with
it
on
the
way
it
began
to
swell
with
anger
and
the
nearer
your
house
i
came
the
more
it
swelled
most
of
all
when
i
was
mounting
your
stairs
the
lord
is
angry
with
you
on
account
of
the
innocent
blood
that
you
have
shed
and
if
you
do
not
at
once
give
me
the
four
hundred
ounces
and
an
annuity
to
each
of
the
goldsmiths
widows
you
too
will
swell
in
the
same
way
and
wrath
will
visit
you
the
bishop
was
frightened
and
gave
him
the
four
hundred
ounces
and
bade
him
send
all
the
widows
to
him
so
that
he
could
give
each
of
them
a
yearly
pension
giufà
took
the
money
and
went
to
each
widow
and
said
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
will
procure
you
an
annuity
from
the
bishop
each
gave
him
a
handsome
sum
and
giufà
took
home
to
his
mother
a
great
heap
of
money
one
day
giufà
mother
sent
him
to
another
town
where
there
was
a
fair
on
the
way
some
children
met
him
who
asked
where
are
you
going
giufà
to
the
fair
will
you
bring
me
back
a
whistle
yes
and
me
too
yes
me
too
me
too
asked
one
after
the
other
and
giufà
said
yes
to
all
at
last
there
was
a
child
who
said
giufà
bring
me
a
whistle
too
here
is
a
penny
when
giufà
came
back
from
the
fair
he
brought
one
whistle
only
and
gave
it
to
the
last
boy
giufà
you
promised
each
of
us
one
cried
the
other
children
you
did
not
give
me
a
penny
to
buy
it
with
answered
giufà
the
counterpart
of
giufà
is
found
in
a
venetian
story
bernoni
no
entitled
the
fool
which
is
in
substance
as
follows
civ
the
fool
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
mother
who
had
a
son
with
little
brains
one
morning
she
said
we
must
get
up
early
for
we
have
to
make
bread
so
they
both
rose
early
and
began
to
make
bread
the
mother
made
the
loaves
but
took
no
pains
to
make
them
the
same
size
her
son
said
to
her
finally
how
small
you
have
made
this
loaf
mother
oh
said
she
it
does
not
matter
whether
they
are
big
or
little
for
the
proverb
says
and
small
all
must
go
to
mass
good
good
when
the
bread
was
made
instead
of
carrying
it
to
the
baker
the
son
took
it
to
the
church
for
it
was
the
hour
for
mass
saying
my
mother
said
that
and
small
all
must
go
to
mass
so
he
threw
the
loaves
down
in
the
middle
of
the
church
then
he
went
home
to
his
mother
and
said
i
have
done
what
you
told
me
to
do
good
did
you
take
the
bread
to
the
baker
oh
mother
if
you
had
seen
how
they
all
looked
at
me
you
might
also
have
cast
an
eye
on
them
in
return
said
his
mother
wait
wait
i
will
cast
an
eye
at
them
too
he
exclaimed
and
went
to
the
stable
and
cut
out
the
eyes
of
all
the
animals
and
putting
them
in
a
handkerchief
went
to
the
church
and
when
any
man
or
woman
looked
at
him
he
threw
an
eye
at
them
when
his
mother
learned
what
he
had
done
she
took
to
her
bed
and
sent
her
son
for
a
physician
when
the
doctor
came
he
felt
her
pulse
and
said
oh
how
weak
this
poor
woman
is
then
he
told
the
son
that
he
must
take
good
care
of
his
mother
and
make
her
some
very
thin
broth
and
give
her
a
bowlful
every
minute
the
son
promised
to
obey
him
and
went
to
the
market
and
bought
a
sparrow
and
put
on
the
fire
a
pail
of
water
when
it
boiled
he
put
in
the
sparrow
and
waited
until
it
boiled
up
two
or
three
times
and
then
took
a
bowl
of
the
broth
to
his
mother
and
repeated
the
dose
as
fast
as
he
could
the
next
day
the
physician
found
the
poor
woman
weaker
than
ever
and
told
her
son
he
must
put
something
heavy
on
her
so
as
to
throw
her
into
a
perspiration
when
the
doctor
had
gone
the
son
piled
all
the
heavy
furniture
in
the
room
on
her
and
when
she
could
no
longer
breathe
he
ran
for
the
doctor
again
this
time
the
doctor
saw
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
and
advised
her
son
to
have
her
confess
and
prepare
for
death
so
her
son
dressed
her
and
carried
her
to
church
and
sat
her
in
the
confessional
and
told
the
priest
that
some
one
was
waiting
for
him
and
then
went
home
the
priest
soon
saw
that
the
woman
was
dead
and
went
to
find
her
son
when
the
son
heard
that
his
mother
was
dead
he
declared
that
the
priest
had
killed
her
and
began
to
beat
him
there
are
many
stories
in
italy
which
turn
on
the
tricks
played
by
a
sharper
on
his
credulous
friends
a
good
specimen
of
the
class
is
the
following
from
sicily
pitrè
no
cv
uncle
capriano
there
was
once
a
husband
and
wife
who
had
a
daughter
the
man
name
was
uncle
capriano
and
he
owned
near
the
town
a
piece
of
property
where
he
always
worked
one
day
thirteen
robbers
happened
to
pass
that
way
saw
uncle
capriano
dismounted
and
began
to
talk
with
him
and
soon
formed
a
friendship
for
him
after
this
they
frequently
went
to
divert
themselves
with
him
when
they
arrived
they
always
saluted
him
with
good
day
uncle
capriano
and
he
answered
your
servant
gentlemen
what
are
your
worships
doing
we
have
come
to
amuse
ourselves
go
uncle
capriano
go
and
lunch
for
we
will
do
the
work
meanwhile
so
he
went
and
ate
and
they
did
his
work
for
him
finally
what
do
you
suppose
uncle
capriano
tried
to
do
he
sought
to
invent
some
way
to
get
money
from
the
robbers
when
he
went
home
he
said
to
his
wife
i
am
on
friendly
terms
with
the
robbers
and
i
would
like
to
see
whether
i
can
get
a
little
money
out
of
them
and
i
have
invented
this
story
to
tell
them
that
we
have
a
rabbit
which
i
send
home
alone
every
evening
with
and
things
for
soup
which
my
wife
cooks
then
he
said
to
his
daughter
when
i
come
with
the
thieves
you
bathe
the
rabbit
in
water
and
come
out
of
the
door
to
meet
me
and
say
that
the
way
to
load
the
poor
little
rabbit
so
that
it
comes
home
tired
to
death
when
the
thieves
heard
that
he
had
a
rabbit
that
carried
things
they
wanted
it
saying
if
we
had
it
we
could
send
it
to
carry
money
food
and
other
things
to
our
houses
uncle
capriano
said
to
them
one
day
i
should
like
to
have
you
come
to
my
house
there
were
thirteen
of
the
thieves
one
said
yes
another
said
no
the
captain
said
let
us
go
and
see
the
rabbit
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
the
daughter
came
to
the
door
and
said
is
that
the
way
to
load
the
poor
little
rabbit
so
that
it
comes
home
tired
to
death
when
they
entered
the
house
all
felt
of
the
rabbit
and
exclaimed
poor
little
animal
poor
little
animal
it
is
all
covered
with
sweat
when
the
thieves
saw
this
they
looked
at
each
other
and
said
shall
we
ask
him
to
give
us
this
little
rabbit
then
they
said
uncle
capriano
you
must
give
us
the
rabbit
without
any
words
and
we
will
pay
you
whatever
you
ask
he
answered
ask
me
for
anything
except
this
rabbit
for
if
i
give
you
that
i
shall
be
ruined
they
replied
you
must
give
it
to
us
without
further
words
whether
you
are
ruined
or
not
finally
uncle
capriano
let
them
have
the
rabbit
for
two
hundred
ounces
and
they
gave
him
twenty
besides
to
buy
himself
a
present
with
after
the
thieves
had
got
possession
of
the
rabbit
they
went
to
a
house
in
the
country
to
try
it
they
each
took
a
bag
of
money
and
said
let
us
send
a
bag
to
each
of
our
houses
the
captain
said
first
carry
a
bag
to
mine
so
they
took
the
rabbit
to
load
it
and
after
they
had
put
the
bags
on
it
the
rabbit
could
not
move
and
one
of
the
thieves
struck
it
on
the
haunch
with
a
switch
then
the
rabbit
ran
away
instantly
the
thieves
went
in
great
anger
to
uncle
capriano
and
said
did
you
have
the
boldness
to
play
such
a
trick
on
us
to
sell
us
a
rabbit
that
could
not
stir
when
we
put
a
few
bags
of
money
on
it
but
gentlemen
said
the
old
man
did
you
beat
it
of
course
answered
one
of
the
thieves
my
companion
struck
it
with
a
switch
on
the
haunch
the
old
man
asked
but
where
did
you
strike
it
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
haunch
on
the
left
that
is
why
the
rabbit
ran
away
said
the
old
man
you
should
have
hit
it
on
the
right
if
you
did
not
observe
these
conditions
what
fault
is
it
of
mine
this
is
true
said
the
thieves
uncle
capriano
is
right
so
go
and
eat
and
we
will
attend
to
the
work
and
so
their
friendship
was
not
broken
this
time
after
a
time
uncle
capriano
said
to
his
wife
we
must
get
some
more
money
from
the
thieves
in
what
way
you
must
buy
a
new
pot
and
then
you
must
cook
in
an
old
pot
somewhere
in
the
house
and
at
ave
maria
just
before
i
come
home
you
must
empty
the
old
pot
into
the
new
one
and
put
it
on
the
hearth
without
any
fire
i
will
tell
the
thieves
that
i
have
a
pot
that
cooks
without
any
fire
the
next
evening
uncle
capriano
persuaded
the
thieves
to
go
home
with
him
when
they
saw
the
pot
they
looked
at
one
another
and
said
we
must
ask
him
to
give
it
to
us
after
some
hesitation
he
sold
it
to
them
for
four
hundred
ounces
and
twenty
over
as
before
when
the
thieves
arrived
at
their
house
in
the
country
they
killed
a
fine
kid
put
it
into
the
pot
and
set
it
on
the
hearth
without
any
fire
and
went
away
in
the
evening
they
all
ran
and
tried
to
see
who
would
arrive
first
and
find
the
meat
cooked
the
one
who
arrived
first
took
out
a
piece
of
meat
and
saw
that
it
was
as
they
had
left
it
then
he
gave
the
pot
a
kick
and
broke
it
in
two
when
the
others
came
and
found
the
meat
not
cooked
they
started
for
uncle
capriano
and
complained
to
him
that
he
had
sold
them
a
pot
that
cooked
everything
and
that
they
had
put
meat
into
it
and
found
it
raw
did
you
break
the
pot
asked
uncle
capriano
of
course
we
broke
it
what
kind
of
a
hearth
did
you
have
high
or
low
one
of
the
thieves
answered
rather
high
that
was
why
the
pot
did
not
cook
it
should
have
been
low
you
did
not
observe
the
conditions
and
broke
the
pot
what
fault
is
that
of
mine
the
thieves
said
uncle
capriano
is
right
go
uncle
capriano
and
eat
for
we
will
do
your
work
some
time
after
uncle
capriano
said
again
to
his
wife
we
must
get
some
more
money
out
of
them
but
how
can
we
manage
it
you
know
that
we
have
a
whistle
in
the
chest
have
it
put
in
order
and
go
to
the

a
bladder
of

and
when

sitting
down
and
angry
and
the
candle
not

i
will
bring
my
friends
with

and
when
i
find

candle
not

i
will
begin
to
cry

and
you
will
not
utter
a
word
then
i
will
take
my
knife
and
cut
your
throat
you
will
fall
down
on
the
floor
the
blood
will
run
out
of
the
bladder
and
the
thieves
will
believe
that
you
are
dead
you
turning
to
his
daughter
what
i
say
i
mean
when
i
tell
you

it
and
give
it
to
me
when
i
blow
it
three
times
you
speaking
to

floor
when
the
thieves
see
this
operation
they
will
want
the
whistle
and
we
will
get
another
six
hundred
ounces
from

everything
took
place
as
uncle
capriano
had
arranged
the
thieves
paid
him
six
hundred
ounces
and
twenty
over
as
usual
and
then
went
home
and
killed
their
wives
to
try
the
whistle
on
them
the
rage
of
the
thieves
can
be
imagined
when
they
found
they
had
been
deceived
again
in
order
to
avenge
themselves
they
took
a
sack
and
went
to
uncle
capriano
and
without
any
words
seized
him
put
him
in
it
and
taking
him
on
a
horse
rode
away
they
came
after
a
time
to
a
where
they
stopped
to
eat
leaving
uncle
capriano
outside
in
the
bag
uncle
capriano
who
was
in
the
bag
began
to
cry
they
want
to
give
me
the
king
daughter
and
i
do
want
her
there
happened
to
be
near
by
a
herdsman
who
heard
what
he
was
saying
about
the
king
daughter
and
he
said
to
himself
i
will
go
and
take
her
myself
so
he
went
to
uncle
capriano
and
said
what
is
the
matter

the
king
daughter
and
i
do

we
arrange
it
uncle
capriano
answered
take
me
out
and
get
into
the
bag
yourself

is
a
good
idea
said
the
herdsman
so
he
set
uncle
capriano
at
liberty
and
got
into
the
bag
himself
uncle
capriano
tied
him
fast
took
his
crook
and
went
to

the
sheep

began
to
cry
they
want
to
give
me
the
king
daughter
i
will
take
her
i
will
take
her
in
a
little
while
the
thieves
came
and
put
the
bag
on
a
horse
and
rode
away
to
the
sea
the
herdsman
crying
out
all
the
time
they
want
to
give
me
the
king
daughter
i
will
take
her
i

happened
to
look
up
on
the
mountain
and
exclaimed

now
then
they
went
to
him
and
said
how

this
uncle
capriano

we
throw
you
in
the
sea
oh
you
threw
me
in
near
the
shore
and
i
found
these
sheep
and
oxen
if
you
had
thrown
me
in
farther
out
i
would
have
found
many
more
then
they
asked
uncle
capriano
to
throw
them
all
in
and
they
went
to
the
sea
and
he
began
to
throw
them
in
and
each
said

uncle
capriano
throw
me
in
quickly
before
my
comrades
get
them
all
after
he
had
thrown

all
in

took
the
horses
and
sheep

for
there

there
was
once
a
whimsical
prince
who
thought
he
could
arrange
the
world
and
animals
as
he
pleased
and
overcome
nature
he
taught
his
horse
to
devour
flesh
and
his
dogs
to
eat
grass
he
trained
an
ass
to
dance
and
accompany
himself
by
his
braying
in
short
the
prince
boasted
that
by
means
of
art
one
could
rule
nature
among
other
things
he
trained
a
cat
to
stand
on
the
table
and
hold
a
lighted
candle
while
he
was
eating
no
matter
what
was
brought
on
the
table
the
cat
never
moved
but
held
the
candle
as
if
it
had
been
a
statue
of
wood
the
prince
showed
the
cat
to
his
friends
and
said
boastingly
nature
is
nothing
my
art
is
more
powerful
and
can
do
this
and
other
things
his
friends
often
said
that
everything
must
be
true
to
its
nature
art
departs
and
nature
prevails
the
prince
invited
them
to
make
any
trial
they
wished
asserting
that
the
cat
would
never
forget
the
art
he
had
taught
it
one
of
his
friends
caught
a
mouse
one
day
and
wrapped
it
up
in
a
handkerchief
and
carried
it
with
him
to
the
prince
when
the
cat
heard
and
saw
the
mouse
it
dropped
the
candlestick
and
ran
after
the
mouse
the
friend
began
to
laugh
and
said
to
the
prince
who
stood
with
his
mouth
wide
open
with
amazement
dear
prince
i
always
told
you
art
departs
and
nature
prevails
this
story
is
told
of
dante
and
cecco
d
ascoli
the
former
playing
the
rôle
of
the
prince
to
counterbalance
the
stories
of
foolish
people
which
have
been
related
above
we
will
conclude
this
chapter
with
some
stories
of
clever
people

which
were
popular
as
long
ago
as
the
middle
ages

the
clever
peasant

was
once
a

a
peasant
working
in

and
asked

answered
the
peasant

the
king

second
i
put

at
interest
the
third
i
give

and
the
fourth
i
throw

the
king
rode
on
but
after
a
time
the
peasant
answer
seemed
very
curious
to
him
so
he
returned
and
asked
him

me
what
do
you
mean
by
eating
the
first
putting
the
second
out
to
interest
giving
back
the
third
and
throwing

fourth
the
peasant
answered
with
the

i
feed
my
children
who
must
care
for
me
when
i
am

i
feed
my
father
and
so
repay
him
for
what
he
has
done
for
me
and
with
the
fourth
i
feed
my
wife
and
thus
throw
it
away
because
i
have
no
profit
from
it
yes
said
the
king
you

me
however
that

will
not
tell

until

seen
my

a
hundred
times
the
peasant
promised
and
the
king
rode
home
well
pleased
while
sitting
at
table
with
his
ministers
he
said
i
will
give
you
a
riddle

the
first
he
eats
the
second
he
puts

the
third
he
gives

and
the
fourth
he
throws
away
what
is
that
no
one
was
able
to
answer
it
one
of
the
ministers
remembered
finally
that
the
king
had
spoken
the
day
before
with
the
peasant
and
he
resolved
to
find
the
peasant
and
obtain
from
him
the
answer
when
he
saw
the
peasant
he
asked
him
for
the
answer
to
the
riddle
but
the
peasant
answered
i
can
not
tell
you
for
i
have
promised
the
king
to
tell
no
one
until
i
have
seen
his
face
a
hundred
times
oh
said
the
minister
i
can
show
you
the
king
face
and
drew
a
hundred
coins
from
his
purse
and
gave
them
to
the
peasant
on
every
coin
the
king
face
was
to
be
seen
of
course
after
the
peasant
had
looked
at
each
coin
once
he
said
i
have
now
seen
the
king
face
a
hundred
times
and
can
tell
you
the
answer
to
the
riddle
and
told
him
it
the
minister
went
in
great
glee
to
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
i
have
found
the
answer
to
the
riddle
it
is
so
and
so
the
king
exclaimed
you
can
have
heard
it
only
from
the
peasant
himself
had
the
peasant
summoned
and
took
him
to
task
did
you
not
promise
me
not
to
tell
it
until
you
had
seen
my
face
a
hundred
times
but
your
majesty
answered
the
peasant
your
minister
showed
me
your
picture
a
hundred
times
then
he
showed
him
the
bag
of
money
that
the
minister
had
given
him
the
king
was
so
pleased
with
the
clever
peasant
that
he
rewarded
him
and
made
him
a
rich
man
for
the
rest
of
his
life
cviii
the
clever
girl
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
huntsman
who
had
a
wife
and
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
and
all
lived
together
in
a
wood
where
no
one
ever
came
and
so
they
knew
nothing
about
the
world
the
father
alone
sometimes
went
to
the
city
and
brought
back
the
news
the
king
son
once
went
hunting
and
lost
himself
in
that
wood
and
while
he
was
seeking
his
way
it
became
night
he
was
weary
and
hungry
imagine
how
he
felt
but
all
at
once
he
saw
a
light
shining
at
a
distance
he
followed
it
and
reached
the
huntsman
house
and
asked
for
lodging
and
something
to
eat
the
huntsman
recognized
him
at
once
and
said
highness
we
have
already
supped
on
our
best
but
if
we
can
find
anything
for
you
you
must
be
satisfied
with
it
what
can
we
do
we
are
so
far
from
the
towns
that
we
can
not
procure
what
we
need
every
day
meanwhile
he
had
a
capon
cooked
for
him
the
prince
did
not
wish
to
eat
it
alone
but
called
all
the
huntsman
family
and
gave
the
head
of
the
capon
to
the
father
the
back
to
the
mother
the
legs
to
the
son
and
the
wings
to
the
daughter
and
ate
the
rest
himself
in
the
house
there
were
only
two
beds
in
the
same
room
in
one
the
husband
and
wife
slept
in
the
other
the
brother
and
sister
the
old
people
went
and
slept
in
the
stable
giving
up
their
bed
to
the
prince
when
the
girl
saw
that
the
prince
was
asleep
she
said
to
her
brother
i
will
wager
that
you
do
not
know
why
the
prince
divided
the
capon
among
us
in
the
manner
he
did
do
you
know
tell
me
why
he
gave
the
head
to
papa
because
he
is
the
head
of
the
family
the
back
to
mamma
because
she
has
on
her
shoulders
all
the
affairs
of
the
house
the
legs
to
you
because
you
must
be
quick
in
performing
the
errands
which
are
given
you
and
the
wings
to
me
to
fly
away
and
catch
a
husband
the
prince
pretended
to
be
asleep
but
he
was
awake
and
heard
these
words
and
perceived
that
the
girl
had
much
judgment
and
as
she
was
also
pretty
he
fell
in
love
with
her
the
next
morning
he
left
the
huntsman
and
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
court
he
sent
him
by
a
servant
a
purse
of
money
to
the
young
girl
he
sent
a
cake
in
the
form
of
a
full
moon
thirty
patties
and
a
cooked
capon
with
three
questions
whether
it
was
the
thirtieth
of
the
month
in
the
wood
whether
the
moon
was
full
and
whether
the
capon
crowed
in
the
night
the
servant
although
a
trusty
one
was
overcome
by
his
gluttony
and
ate
fifteen
of
the
patties
and
a
good
slice
of
the
cake
and
the
capon
the
young
girl
who
had
understood
it
all
sent
back
word
to
the
prince
that
the
moon
was
not
full
but
on
the
wane
that
it
was
only
the
fifteenth
of
the
month
and
that
the
capon
had
gone
to
the
mill
and
that
she
asked
him
to
spare
the
pheasant
for
the
sake
of
the
partridge
the
prince
too
understood
the
metaphor
and
having
summoned
the
servant
he
cried
rogue
you
have
eaten
the
capon
fifteen
patties
and
a
good
slice
of
the
cake
thank
that
girl
who
has
interceded
for
you
if
she
had
not
i
would
have
hung
you
a
few
months
after
this
the
huntsman
found
a
gold
mortar
and
wished
to
present
it
to
the
prince
but
his
daughter
said
you
will
be
laughed
at
for
this
present
you
will
see
that
the
prince
will
say
to
you
mortar
is
fine
and
good
but
peasant
where
is
the
pestle
the
father
did
not
listen
to
his
daughter
but
when
he
carried
the
mortar
to
the
prince
he
was
greeted
as
his
daughter
had
foretold
my
daughter
told
me
so
said
the
huntsman
ah
if
i
had
only
listened
to
her
the
prince
heard
these
words
and
said
to
him
your
daughter
who
pretends
to
be
so
wise
must
make
me
a
hundred
ells
of
cloth
out
of
four
ounces
of
flax
if
she
does
not
i
will
hang
you
and
her
the
poor
father
returned
home
weeping
and
sure
that
he
and
his
daughter
must
die
for
who
could
make
a
hundred
ells
of
cloth
with
four
ounces
of
flax
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
and
when
she
learned
why
he
was
weeping
said
is
that
all
you
are
weeping
for
quick
get
me
the
flax
and
i
will
manage
it
she
made
four
small
cords
of
the
flax
and
said
to
her
father
take
these
cords
and
tell
him
that
when
he
makes
me
a
loom
out
of
these
cords
i
will
weave
the
hundred
ells
of
cloth
when
the
prince
heard
this
answer
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
thought
no
more
about
condemning
the
father
or
the
daughter
the
next
day
he
went
to
the
wood
to
visit
the
girl
her
mother
was
dead
and
her
father
was
out
in
the
fields
digging
the
prince
knocked
but
no
one
opened
he
knocked
louder
but
the
same
thing
the
young
girl
was
deaf
to
him
finally
tired
of
waiting
he
broke
open
the
door
and
entered
rude
girl
who
taught
you
not
to
open
to
one
of
my
rank
where
are
your
father
and
mother
who
knew
it
was
you
my
father
is
where
he
should
be
and
my
mother
is
weeping
for
her
sins
you
must
leave
for
i
have
something
else
to
do
than
listen
to
you
the
prince
went
away
in
anger
and
complained
to
the
father
of
his
daughter
rude
manners
but
the
father
excused
her
the
prince
at
last
seeing
how
wise
and
cunning
she
was
married
her
the
wedding
was
celebrated
with
great
splendor
but
an
event
happened
which
came
near
plunging
the
princess
into
misfortune
one
sunday
two
peasants
were
passing
a
church
one
of
them
had
a
and
the
other
was
leading
a
ready
to
foal
the
bell
rang
for
mass
and
they
both
entered
the
church
one
leaving
his
cart
outside
and
the
other
tying
the
ass
to
the
cart
while
they
were
in
the
church
the
ass
foaled
and
the
owner
of
the
ass
and
the
owner
of
the
cart
both
claimed
the
colt
they
appealed
to
the
prince
and
he
decided
that
the
colt
belonged
to
the
owner
of
the
cart
because
he
said
it
was
more
likely
that
the
owner
of
the
ass
would
tie
her
to
the
cart
in
order
to
lay
a
false
claim
to
the
colt
than
that
the
owner
of
the
cart
would
tie
it
to
the
ass
the
owner
of
the
ass
had
right
on
his
side
and
all
the
people
were
in
his
favor
but
the
prince
had
pronounced
sentence
and
there
was
nothing
to
say
the
poor
man
then
applied
to
the
princess
who
advised
him
to
cast
a
net
in
the
square
when
the
prince
passed
when
the
prince
saw
the
net
he
said
what
are
you
doing
you
fool
do
you
expect
to
find
fish
in
the
square
the
peasant
who
had
been
advised
by
the
princess
answered
it
is
easier
for
me
to
find
fish
in
the
square
than
for
a
cart
to
have
foals
the
prince
revoked
the
sentence
but
when
he
returned
to
the
palace
knowing
that
the
princess
had
suggested
the
answer
to
the
peasant
he
said
to
her
prepare
to
return
to
your
own
home
within
an
hour
take
with
you
what
you
like
best
and
depart
she
was
not
at
all
saddened
by
the
prospect
but
ate
a
better
dinner
than
usual
and
made
the
prince
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
in
which
she
had
put
a
sleeping
potion
and
when
he
was
as
sound
asleep
as
a
log
she
had
him
put
in
a
carriage
and
took
him
with
her
to
her
house
in
the
wood
it
was
in
january
and
she
had
the
roof
of
the
house
uncovered
and
it
snowed
on
the
prince
who
awoke
and
called
his
servants
what
do
you
wish
said
the
princess
i
command
here
did
you
not
tell
me
to
take
from
your
house
the
thing
i
liked
best
i
have
taken
you
and
now
you
are
mine
the
prince
laughed
and
they
made
peace
the
next
story
is
the
italian
version
of
the
tale
familiar
to
the
readers
of
grimm
by
the
title
of
doctor
knowall
there
is
a
sicilian
version
in
pitrè
no
in
which
our
story
forms
one
of
several
episodes
it
is
found
however
independently
in
the
mantuan
collection
from
which
we
take
it
changing
the
name
slightly
to
suit
the
conclusion
of
the
story
cix
crab
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
lost
a
valuable
ring
he
looked
for
it
everywhere
but
could
not
find
it
so
he
issued
a
proclamation
that
if
any
astrologer
could
tell
him
where
it
was
he
would
be
richly
rewarded
a
poor
peasant
by
the
name
of
crab
heard
of
the
proclamation
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
wanted
to
be
the
astrologer
to
find
the
king
ring
so
he
went
and
presented
himself
to
the
king
to
whom
he
said
your
majesty
must
know
that
i
am
an
astrologer
although
you
see
me
so
poorly
dressed
i
know
that
you
have
lost
a
ring
and
i
will
try
by
study
to
find
out
where
it
is
very
well
said
the
king
and
when
you
have
found
it
what
reward
must
i
give
you
that
is
at
your
discretion
your
majesty
go
then
study
and
we
shall
see
what
kind
of
an
astrologer
you
turn
out
to
be
he
was
conducted
to
a
room
in
which
he
was
to
be
shut
up
to
study
it
contained
only
a
bed
and
a
table
on
which
were
a
large
book
and
writing
materials
crab
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
did
nothing
but
turn
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
and
scribble
the
paper
so
that
the
servants
who
brought
him
his
food
thought
him
a
great
man
they
were
the
ones
who
had
stolen
the
ring
and
from
the
severe
glances
that
the
peasant
cast
at
them
whenever
they
entered
they
began
to
fear
that
they
would
be
found
out
they
made
him
endless
bows
and
never
opened
their
mouths
without
calling
him
mr
astrologer
crab
who
although
illiterate
was
as
a
peasant
cunning
all
at
once
imagined
that
the
servants
must
know
about
the
ring
and
this
is
the
way
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
he
had
been
shut
up
in
his
room
turning
over
his
big
book
and
scribbling
his
paper
for
a
month
when
his
wife
came
to
visit
him
he
said
to
her
hide
yourself
under
the
bed
and
when
a
servant
enters
say
is
one
when
another
comes
say
is
two
and
so
on
the
woman
hid
herself
the
servants
came
with
the
dinner
and
hardly
had
the
first
one
entered
when
a
voice
from
under
the
bed
said
that
is
one
the
second
one
entered
the
voice
said
that
is
two
and
so
on
the
servants
were
frightened
at
hearing
that
voice
for
they
did
not
know
where
it
came
from
and
held
a
consultation
one
of
them
said
we
are
discovered
if
the
astrologer
denounces
us
to
the
king
as
thieves
we
are
lost
do
you
know
what
we
must
do
said
another
let
us
hear
we
must
go
to
the
astrologer
and
tell
him
frankly
that
we
stole
the
ring
and
ask
him
not
to
betray
us
and
present
him
with
a
purse
of
money
are
you
willing
perfectly
so
they
went
in
harmony
to
the
astrologer
and
making
him
a
lower
bow
than
usual
one
of
them
began
astrologer
you
have
discovered
that
we
stole
the
ring
we
are
poor
people
and
if
you
reveal
it
to
the
king
we
are
undone
so
we
beg
you
not
to
betray
us
and
accept
this
purse
of
money
crab
took
the
purse
and
then
added
i
will
not
betray
you
but
you
must
do
what
i
tell
you
if
you
wish
to
save
your
lives
take
the
ring
and
make
that
turkey
in
the
swallow
it
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
the
servants
were
satisfied
to
do
so
and
departed
with
a
low
bow
the
next
day
crab
went
to
the
king
and
said
to
him
your
majesty
must
know
that
after
having
toiled
over
a
month
i
have
succeeded
in
discovering
where
the
ring
has
gone
to
where
is
it
then
asked
the
king
a
turkey
has
swallowed
it
a
turkey
very
well
let
us
see
they
went
for
the
turkey
opened
it
and
found
the
ring
inside
the
king
amazed
presented
the
astrologer
with
a
large
purse
of
money
and
invited
him
to
a
banquet
among
the
other
dishes
there
was
brought
on
the
table
a
plate
of
crabs
crabs
must
then
have
been
very
rare
because
only
the
king
and
a
few
others
knew
their
name
turning
to
the
peasant
the
king
said
you
who
are
an
astrologer
must
be
able
to
tell
me
the
name
of
these
things
which
are
in
this
dish
the
poor
astrologer
was
very
much
puzzled
and
as
if
speaking
to
himself
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
others
heard
him
he
muttered
ah
crab
crab
what
a
plight
you
are
in
all
who
did
not
know
that
his
name
was
crab
rose
and
proclaimed
him
the
greatest
astrologer

the
world

lead
into
the
vexed
question
of
the
origin
and
diffusion
of
popular
tales
in
general
we
can
not
refrain
however
from
calling
attention
to
a
remark
by
nerucci
in
the
preface
to
his
pop
he
thinks
that
the
italian
popular
tale
will
be
found
to
have
much
the
same
origin
as
the
italian
popular
poetry
that
is
that
very
much
is
of
a
literary
origin
which
has
usually
been
deemed
popular
this
is
undoubtedly
true
of
many
stories
but
may
not
two
versions
of
a
given
story
a
popular
and
a
literary
one
have
had
a
source
common
to
both
a
very
interesting
study
might
be
made
of
the
italian
popular
tales
in
their
relation
to
literary
versions
which
may
be
the
originals
the
most
valuable
contributions
to
the
question
of
the
origin
of
italian
popular
tales
are
those
by
pitrè
in
the
first
volume
of
his
pp
and
in
the

a
thicket
a
large
snake
which
one
day
asked
the
old
man
for
one
of
his
daughters
in
marriage
threatening
him
with
death
if
none
of
them
would
accept
such
an
offer
the
father
told
his
daughters
of
the
snake
offer
and
the
first
and
second
immediately
refused
if
the
third
had
refused
too
there
would
have
been
no
hope
of
salvation
for
the
father
but
for
his
sake
she
declared
at
once
that
snakes
had
always
pleased
her
and
she
thought
the
snake
proposed
by
her
father
very
handsome
at
this
the
snake
shook
his
tail
in
token
of
great
joy
and
making
his
bride
mount
it
carried
her
away
to
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
meadow
where
he
caused
a
splendid
palace
to
arise
while
he
himself
became
a
handsome
man
and
revealed
himself
as
sir
fiorante
with
the
red
and
white
stockings
but
woe
to
her
if
she
ever
disclosed
to
any
one
his
existence
and
name
she
would
lose
him
forever
unless
to
obtain
possession
of
him
again
she
wore
out
a
pair
of
iron
shoes
a
staff
and
a
hat
and
filled
with
her
tears
seven
bottles
the
maiden
promised
but
she
was
a
woman
she
went
to
visit
her
sisters
one
of
them
wished
to
know
her
husband
name
and
was
so
cunning
that
at
last
her
sister
told
her
but
when
the
poor
girl
went
back
to
see
her
husband
she
found
neither
husband
nor
palace
to
find
him
again
she
was
obliged
in
despair
to
do
penance
she
walked
and
walked
and
walked
and
wept
unceasingly
she
had
already
filled
one
bottle
with
tears
when
she
met
an
old
woman
who
gave
her
a
fine
walnut
to
crack
in
time
of
need
and
disappeared
when
she
had
filled
four
bottles
she
met
another
old
woman
who
gave
her
a
to
crack
in
time
of
need
and
disappeared
she
had
filled
all
seven
bottles
when
a
third
old
woman
appeared
to
her
and
left
her
an
almond
to
be
cracked
in
a
third
case
of
need
and
she
too
disappeared
at
last
the
young
girl
reached
the
castle
of
sir
fiorante
who
had
taken
another
wife
the
girl
broke
first
the
walnut
and
found
in
it
a
beautiful
dress
which
the
second
wife
wanted
herself
the
young
girl
said
you
may
have
it
if
you
will
let
me
sleep
with
sir
fiorante
the
second
wife
consented
but
meanwhile
she
gave
sir
fiorante
some
opium
in
the
night
the
young
girl
said
sir
fiorante
with
the
red
and
white
stockings
i
have
worn
out
a
pair
of
iron
shoes
the
staff
and
the
hat
and
filled
seven
bottles
with
tears
wherefore
you
must
recognize
your
first
wife
he
made
no
answer
for
he
had
taken
opium
the
next
day
the
girl
opened
the
and
out
came
a
dress
more
beautiful
than
the
first
sir
fiorante
second
wife
wanted
this
and
obtained
it
on
the
same
condition
as
the
first
but
took
care
that
sir
fiorante
should
take
some
opium
before
going
to
bed
the
third
day
a
faithful
servant
asked
sir
fiorante
if
he
had
not
heard
in
the
night
the
cries
that
were
uttered
near
him
sir
fiorante
replied
no
but
was
careful
not
to
take
any
opium
the
third
night
when
having
broken
the
almond
and
found
in
it
a
dress
of
unapproachable
beauty
the
young
girl
obtained
the
second
wife
consent
to
sleep
anew
with
sir
fiorante
the
latter
pretended
this
time
to
take
the
opium
but
did
not
then
he
feigned
to
be
asleep
but
remained
awake
in
order
to
hear
the
cries
of
his
abandoned
wife
which
he
could
not
resist
and
began
to
embrace
her
the
next
day
they
left
that
palace
to
the
second
wife
and
departed
together
and
went
to
live
in
happiness
at

the
following
story
from
siena
pitrè
scatola
di
will
sufficiently
illustrate
this
class
xxi
the
crystal
casket
there
was
once
a
widower
who
had
a
daughter
this
daughter
was
between
ten
and
twelve
years
old
her
father
sent
her
to
school
and
as
she
was
all
alone
in
the
world
commended
her
always
to
her
teacher
now
the
teacher
seeing
that
the
child
had
no
mother
fell
in
love
with
the
father
and
kept
saying
to
the
girl
ask
your
father
if
he
would
like
me
for
a
wife
this
she
said
to
her
every
day
and
at
last
the
girl
said
papa
the
is
always
asking
me
if
you
will
marry
her
the
father
said
eh
my
daughter
if
i
take
another
wife
you
will
have
great
troubles
but
the
girl
persisted
and
finally
the
father
was
persuaded
to
go
one
evening
to
the
house
when
she
saw
him
she
was
well
pleased
and
they
settled
the
marriage
in
a
few
days
poor
child
how
bitterly
she
had
to
repent
having
found
a
stepmother
so
ungrateful
and
cruel
to
her
she
sent
her
every
day
out
on
a
terrace
to
water
a
pot
of
basil
and
it
was
so
dangerous
that
if
she
fell
she
would
go
into
a
large
river
one
day
there
came
by
a
large
eagle
and
said
to
her
what
are
you
doing
here
she
was
weeping
because
she
saw
how
great
the
danger
was
of
falling
into
the
stream
the
eagle
said
to
her
get
on
my
back
and
i
will
carry
you
away
and
you
will
be
happier
than
with
your
new
mamma
after
a
long
journey
they
reached
a
great
plain
where
they
found
a
beautiful
palace
all
of
crystal
the
eagle
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
open
my
ladies
open
for
i
have
brought
you
a
pretty
girl
when
the
people
in
the
palace
opened
the
door
and
saw
that
lovely
girl
they
were
amazed
and
kissed
and
caressed
her
meanwhile
the
door
was
closed
and
they
remained
peaceful
and
contented
let
us
return
to
the
eagle
who
thought
she
was
doing
a
spite
to
the
stepmother
one
day
the
eagle
flew
away
to
the
terrace
where
the
stepmother
was
watering
the
basil
where
is
your
daughter
asked
the
eagle
eh
she
replied
perhaps
she
fell
from
this
terrace
and
went
into
the
river
i
have
not
heard
from
her
in
ten
days
the
eagle
answered
what
a
fool
you
are
i
carried
her
away
seeing
that
you
treated
her
so
harshly
i
carried
her
away
to
my
fairies
and
she
is
very
well
then
the
eagle
flew
away
the
stepmother
filled
with
rage
and
jealousy
called
a
witch
from
the
city
and
said
to
her
you
see
my
daughter
is
alive
and
is
in
the
house
of
some
fairies
of
an
eagle
which
often
comes
upon
my
terrace
now
you
must
do
me
the
favor
to
find
some
way
to
kill
this
stepdaughter
of
mine
for
i
am
afraid
that
some
day
or
other
she
will
return
and
my
husband
discovering
this
matter
will
certainly
kill
me
the
witch
answered
oh
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
that
leave
it
to
me
what
did
the
witch
do
she
had
made
a
little
basketful
of
sweetmeats
in
which
she
put
a
charm
then
she
wrote
a
letter
pretending
that
it
was
her
father
who
having
learned
where
she
was
wished
to
make
her
this
present
and
the
letter
pretended
that
her
father
was
so
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
with
the
fairies
let
us
leave
the
witch
who
is
arranging
all
this
deception
and
return
to
ermellina
for
so
the
young
girl
was
named
the
fairies
had
said
to
her
see

we
are
going
away
and

be

four
days
now
in

time
take
good
care
not
to
open
the
door
to
any
one
for
some
treachery
is
being
prepared
for
you
by
your
stepmother
she
promised
to
open
the
door
to
no
one
do
not
be
anxious
i
am
well
off
and
my
stepmother
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
it
was
not
so
the
fairies
went
away
and
the
next
day
when
ermellina
was
alone
she
heard
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
said
to
herself
knock
away
i
do
open
to
any
one
but
meanwhile
the
blows
redoubled
and
curiosity
forced
her
to
look
out
of
the
window
what
did
she
see
she
saw
one
of
the
servant
girls
of
her
own
home
for
the
witch

disguised
herself
as
one
of

father
servants
o
my
dear
ermellina

said
your
father
is
shedding
tears
of
sorrow
for
you

really
believed
you
were
dead
but
the
eagle
which
carried
you
off
came
and
told
him
the
good
news
that
you
were
here
with
the
fairies
meanwhile
your
father
not
knowing
what
civility
to
show
you
for
he
understands
very
well
that
you
are
in
need
of
nothing
has
thought
to
send
you
this
little
basket
of
sweetmeats
ermellina
had
not
yet
opened
the
door
the
servant
begged
her
to
come
down
and
take
the
basket
and
the
letter
but
she
said
no
i
wish
nothing
but
finally
since
women
and
especially
young
girls
are
fond
of
sweetmeats
she
descended
and
opened
the
door
when
the
witch
had
given
her
the
basket
she
said
eat
this
and
broke
off
for
her
a
piece
of
the
sweetmeats
which
she
had
poisoned
when
ermellina
took
the
first
mouthful
the
old
woman
disappeared
ermellina
had
scarcely
time
to
close
the
door
when
she
fell
down
on
the
stairs
when
the
fairies
returned
they
knocked
at
the
door
but
no
one
opened
it
for
them
then
they
perceived
that
there
had
been
some
treachery
and
began
to
weep
then
the
chief
of
the
fairies
said
we
must
break
open
the
door
and
so
they
did
and
saw
ermellina
dead
on
the
stairs
her
other
friends
who
loved
her
so
dearly
begged
the
chief
of
the
fairies
to
bring
her
to
life
but
she
would
not
for
said
she
she
has
disobeyed
me
but
one
and
the
other
asked
her
until
she
consented
she
opened
ermellina
mouth
took
out
a
piece
of
the
sweetmeat
which
she
had
not
yet
swallowed
raised
her
up
and
ermellina
came
to
life
again
we
can
imagine
what
a
pleasure
it
was
for
her
friends
but
the
chief
of
the
fairies
reproved
her
for
her
disobedience
and
she
promised
not
to
do
so
again
once
more
the
fairies
were
obliged
to
depart
their
chief
said
remember
ermellina
the
first
time
i
cured
you
but
the
second
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
ermellina
said
they
need
not
worry
that
she
would
not
open
to
any
one
but
it
was
not
so
for
the
eagle
thinking
to
increase
her
stepmother
anger
told
her
again
that
ermellina
was
alive
the
stepmother
denied
it
all
to
the
eagle
but
she
summoned
anew
the
witch
and
told
her
that
her
stepdaughter
was
still
alive
saying
either
you
will
really
kill
her
or
i
will
be
avenged
on
you
the
old
woman
finding
herself
caught
told
her
to
buy
a
very
handsome
dress
one
of
the
handsomest
she
could
find
and
transformed
herself
into
a
tailoress
belonging
to
the
family
took
the
dress
departed
went
to
poor
ermellina
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
open
open
for
i
am
your
tailoress
ermellina
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
her
tailoress
and
was
in
truth
a
little
confused
indeed
anyone
would
have
been
so
the
tailoress
said
come
down
i
must
fit
a
dress
on
you
she
replied
no
no
for
i
have
been
deceived
once
but
i
am
not
the
old
woman
replied
the
tailoress
you
know
me
for
i
have
always
made
your
dresses
poor
ermellina
was
persuaded
and
descended
the
stairs
the
tailoress
took
to
flight
while
ermellina
was
yet
buttoning
up
the
dress
and
disappeared
ermellina
closed
the
door
and
was
mounting
the
stairs
but
it
was
not
permitted
her
to
go
up
for
she
fell
down
dead
let
us
return
to
the
fairies
who
came
home
and
knocked
at
the
door
but
what
good
did
it
do
to
knock
there
was
no
longer
any
one
there
they
began
to
weep
the
chief
of
the
fairies
said
i
told
you
that
she
would
betray
me
again
but
now
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
so
they
broke
open
the
door
and
saw
the
poor
girl
with
that
beautiful
dress
on
but
she
was
dead
they
all
wept
because
they
really
loved
her
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
the
chief
struck
her
enchanted
wand
and
commanded
a
beautiful
rich
casket
all
covered
with
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
to
appear
then
the
others
made
a
beautiful
garland
of
flowers
and
gold
put
it
on
the
young
girl
and
then
laid
her
in
the
casket
which
was
so
rich
and
beautiful
that
it
was
marvellous
to
behold
then
the
old
fairy
struck
her
wand
as
usual
and
commanded
a
handsome
horse
the
like
of
which
not
even
the
king
possessed
then
they
took
the
casket
put
it
on
the
horse
back
and
led
him
into
the
public
square
of
the
city
and
the
chief
of
the
fairies
said
go
and
do
not
stop
until
you
find
some
one
who
says
to
you
for
pity
sake
for
i
have
lost
my
horse
for
you
now
let
us
leave
the
afflicted
fairies
and
turn
our
attention
to
the
horse
which
ran
away
at
full
speed
who
happened
to
pass
at
that
moment
the
son
of
a
king
the
name
of
this
king
is
not
known
and
saw
this
horse
with
that
wonder
on
its
back
then
the
king
began
to
spur
his
horse
and
rode
him
so
hard
that
he
killed
him
and
had
to
leave
him
dead
in
the
road
but
the
king
kept
running
after
the
other
horse
the
poor
king
could
endure
it
no
longer
he
saw
himself
lost
and
exclaimed
stop
for
pity
sake
for
i
have
lost
my
horse
for
you
then
the
horse
stopped
for
those
were
the
words
when
the
king
saw
that
beautiful
girl
dead
in
the
casket
he
thought
no
more
about
his
own
horse
but
took
the
other
to
the
city
the
king
mother
knew
that
her
son
had
gone
hunting
when
she
saw
him
returning
with
this
loaded
horse
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
the
son
had
no
father
wherefore
he
was
all
powerful
he
reached
the
palace
had
the
horse
unloaded
and
the
casket
carried
to
his
chamber
then
he
called
his
mother
and
said
mother
i
went
hunting
but
i
have
found
a
wife
but
what
is
it
a
doll
a
dead
woman
mother
replied
her
son
do
trouble
yourself
about
what
it
is
it
is
my
wife
his
mother
began
to
laugh
and
withdrew
to
her
own
room
what
could
she
do
poor
mother
now
this
poor
king
no
longer
went
hunting
took
no
diversion
did
not
even
go
to
the
table
but
ate
in
his
own
room
by
a
fatality
it
happened
that
war
was
declared
against
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
depart
he
called
his
mother
and
said
mother
i
wish
two
careful
chambermaids
whose
business
it
shall
be
to
guard
this
casket
for
if
on
my
return
i
find
that
anything
has
happened
to
my
casket
i
shall
have
the
chambermaids
killed
his
mother
who
loved
him
said
go
my
son
fear
nothing
for
i
myself
will
watch
over
your
casket
he
wept
several
days
at
being
obliged
to
abandon
this
treasure
of
his
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
had
to
go
after
his
departure
he
did
nothing
but
commend
his
wife
so
he
called
her
to
his
mother
in
his
letters
let
us
return
to
the
mother
who
no
longer
thought
about
the
matter
not
even
to
have
the
casket
dusted
but
all
at
once
there
came
a
letter
which
informed
her
that
the
king
had
been
victorious
and
should
return
to
his
palace
in
a
few
days
the
mother
called
the
chambermaids
and
said
to
them
girls
we
are
ruined
they
replied
why
highness
because
my
son
will
be
back
in
a
few
days
and
how
have
we
taken
care
of
the
doll
they
said
true
true
now
let
us
go
and
wash
the
doll
face
they
went
to
the
room
and
saw
that
the
doll
face
and
hands
were
covered
with
dust
and
so
they
took
a
sponge
and
washed
her
face
but
some
drops
of
water
fell
on
her
dress
and
spotted
it
the
poor
chambermaids
began
to
weep
and
went
to
the
queen
for
advice
the
queen
said
do
you
know
what
to
do
call
a
tailoress
and
have
a
dress
precisely
like
this
bought
and
take
off
this
one
before
my
son
comes
they
did
so
and
the
chambermaids
went
to
the
room
and
began
to
unbutton
the
dress
the
moment
that
they
took
off
the
first
sleeve
ermellina
opened
her
eyes
the
poor
chambermaids
sprang
up
in
terror
but
one
of
the
most
courageous
said
i
am
a
woman
and
so
is
this
one
she
will
not
eat
me
to
cut
the
matter
short
she
took
off
the
dress
and
when
it
was
removed
ermellina
began
to
get
out
of
the
casket
to
walk
about
and
see
where
she
was
the
chambermaids
fell
on
their
knees
before
her
and
begged
her
to
tell
them
who
she
was
she
poor
girl
told
them
the
whole
story
then
she
said
i
wish
to
know
where
i
am
then
the
chambermaids
called
the
king
mother
to
explain
it
to
her
the
mother
did
not
fail
to
tell
her
everything
and
she
poor
girl
did
nothing
but
weep
penitently
thinking
of
what
the
fairies
had
done
for
her
the
king
was
on
the
point
of
arriving
and
his
mother
said
to
the
doll
come
here
put
on
one
of
my
best
dresses
in
short
she
arrayed
her
like
a
queen
then
came
her
son
they
shut
the
doll
up
in
a
small
room
so
that
she
could
not
be
seen
the
king
came
with
great
joy
with
trumpets
blowing
and
banners
flying
for
the
victory
but
he
took
no
interest
in
all
this
and
ran
at
once
to
his
room
to
see
the
doll
the
chambermaids
fell
on
their
knees
before
him
saying
that
the
doll
smelled
so
badly
that
they
could
not
stay
in
the
palace
and
were
obliged
to
bury
her
the
king
would
not
listen
to
this
excuse
but
at
once
called
two
of
the
palace
servants
to
erect
the
gallows
his
mother
comforted
him
in
vain
my
son
it
was
a
dead
woman
no
no
i
will
not
listen
to
any
reasons
dead
or
alive
you
should
have
left
it
for
me
finally
when
his
mother
saw
that
he
was
in
earnest
about
the
gallows
she
rang
a
little
bell
and
there
came
forth
no
longer
the
doll
but
a
very
beautiful
girl
whose
like
was
never
seen
the
king
was
amazed
and
said
what
is
this
then
his
mother
the
chambermaids
and
ermellina
were
obliged
to
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
he
said
mother
since
i
adored
her
when
dead
and
called
her
my
wife
now
i
mean
her
to
be
my
wife
in
truth
yes
my
son
replied
his
mother
do
so
for
i
am
willing
they
arranged
the
wedding
and
in
a
few
days
were
man
and
wife

dear
father
i
came

chance
to
this
villa
and
the
king
son
was
here
and
married
me
the
father
was
greatly
consoled
at
finding
his
daughter
so
well
married
now
my
father
said
she
empty
this
sack
of
fennel
for
i
will
fill
it
with
gold
for
you
and
then
she
begged
him
to

and
the
daughter
blind
of
one
eye
the
father
returned
home
with
his
bag
full
of
money
and
his

asked
in
terror

gave
you
this
money
he
answered
o
wife
do
you
know
that
i
have
found
my
daughter
and
she
is
the
king
wife
and
filled
this
bag
with
money
she
instead
of
being
happy
was
angry
at
hearing
that
her
stepdaughter
was
still
alive
however
she
said
to
her
husband
i
will
go
and
take
my
daughter
so
they
went
the
husband
the
wife
and
the
blind
daughter
and
came
to
the
husband
daughter
who
received
her
stepmother
very
kindly
but
the
latter
seeing
that
the
king
was
away
and
that
her
stepdaughter
was
alone
seized
her
and
threw
her
from
a
window
into
the
sea
and
what
did
she
do
then
she
took
her
blind
daughter
and
dressed
her
in
the
other
clothes
and
said
to
her
when
the
king
comes
and
finds
you
here
weeping
say
to
him
little
calf
has
blinded
me
with
his
horn
and
i
have
only
one
eye
then
the
stepmother
returned
to
her
own
house
the
king
came
and
found
her
daughter
in
bed
weeping
and
said
to
her
why
are
you
weeping
the
little
calf
struck
me
with
his
horn
and
put
out
one
of
my
eyes
the
king
cried
at
once
go
call
the
butcher
to
kill
the
calf
when
the
calf
heard
that
he
was
to
be
killed
he
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
called
to
his
sister
in
the
sea
oh
sister
for
me
the
water
is
heated
and
the
knives
are
sharpened
the
sister
replied
from
the
sea
oh
brother
i
can
not
help
you
i
am
in
the
mouth
when
the
king
heard
the
calf
utter
these
words
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
when
he
saw
his
wife
in
the
sea
he
summoned
two
sailors
and
had
them
take
her
out
and
bring
her
up
and
restore
her
then
he
took
the
blind
girl
and
killed
her
and
cut
her
in
pieces
and
salted
her
like
and
sent
her
to
her
mother
when
her
husband
found
it
out
he
left
her
and
went
to
live
with
his
daughter
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
mention
here
another
class
of
stories
which
come
under
the
formula
of
persecuted
maiden
the
class
resembles
in
some
respects
the
story
of
king
lear
the
youngest
daughter
is
persecuted
by
her
father
because
he
thinks

water

a
very
fine
story
is
related
and
told
to
your
worships
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
with
three
daughters
these
three
daughters
being
at
table
one
day
their
father
said
come
now
let
us
see
which
of
you
three
loves
me
the
oldest
said
papa
i
love
you
as
much
as
my
eyes
the
second
answered
i
love
you
as
much
as
my
heart
the
youngest
said
i
love
you
as
much
as
water
and
salt
the
king
heard
her
with
amazement
do
you
value
me
like
water
and
salt
quick
call
the
executioners
for
i
will
have
her
killed
immediately
the
other
sisters
privately
gave
the
executioners
a
little
dog
and
told
them
to
kill
it
and
rend
one
of
the
youngest
sister
garments
but
to
leave
her
in
a
cave
this
they
did
and
brought
back
to
the
king
the
dog
tongue
and
the
rent
garment
royal
majesty
here
is
her
tongue
and
garment
and
his
majesty
gave
them
a
reward
the
unfortunate
princess
was
found
in
the
forest
by
a
magician
who
took
her
to
his
house
opposite
the
royal
palace
here
the
king
son
saw
her
and
fell
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
the
match
was
soon
agreed
upon
then
the
magician
came
and
said
you
must
kill
me
the
day
before
the
wedding
you
must
invite
three
kings
your
father
the
first
you
must
order
the
servants
to
pass
water
and
salt
to
all
the
guests
except
your
father
now
let
us
return
to
the
father
of
this
young
girl
who
the
longer
he
lived
the
more
his
love
for
her
increased
and
he
was
sick
of
grief
when
he
received
the
invitation
he
said
and
how
can
i
go
with
this
love
for
my
daughter
and
he
would
not
go
then
he
thought
but
this
king
will
be
offended
if
i
do
not
go
and
will
declare
war
against
me
some
time
he
accepted
and
went
the
day
before
the
wedding
they
killed
the
magician
and
quartered
him
and
put
a
quarter
in
each
of
four
rooms
and
sprinkled
his
blood
in
all
the
rooms
and
on
the
stairway
and
the
blood
and
flesh
became
gold
and
precious
stones
when
the
three
kings
came
and
saw
the
golden
stairs
they
did
not
like
to
step
on
them
never
mind
said
the
prince
go
up
this
is
nothing
that
evening
they
were
married
the
next
day
they
had
a
banquet
the
prince
gave
orders
no
salt
and
water
to
that
king
they
sat
down
at
table
and
the
young
queen
was
near
her
father
but
he
did
not
eat
his
daughter
said
royal
majesty
why
do
you
not
eat
does
not
the
food
please
you
what
an
idea
it
is
very
fine
why
do
you
eat
then
i
do
feel
very
well
the
bride
and
groom
helped
him
to
some
bits
of
meat
but
the
king
did
not
want
it
and
chewed
his
food
over
and
over
again
like
a
goat
as
if
he
could
eat
it
without
salt
when
they
finished
eating
they
began
to
tell
stories
and
the
king
told
them
all
about
his
daughter
she
asked
him
if
he
could
still
recognize
her
and
stepping
out
of
the
room
put
on
the
same
dress
she
wore
when
he
sent
her
away
to
be
killed
you
caused
me
to
be
killed
because
i
told
you
i
loved
you
as
much
as
salt
and
water
now
you
have
seen
what
it
is
to
eat
without
salt
and
water
her
father
could
not
say
a
word
but
embraced
her
and
begged
her
pardon

rarity
from
ive
pop
xxiv
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
and
queen
who
had
a
son
the
queen
was
deeply
grieved
at
this
and
she
thought
to
go
to
the
lord
and
ask
counsel
of
him
what
she
was
to
do
with
this
son
the
lord
told
her
to
try
and
do
something
to
make
him
laugh
she
replied
i
have
nothing
but
a
jar
of
oil
unfortunately
for
me
the
lord
said
to
her
well
give
this
oil
away
in
charity
for
there
will
come
many
people
some
bent
some
straight
some
humpbacked
and
it
may
happen
that
your
son
will
laugh
so
the
queen
proclaimed
that
she
had
a
jar
of
oil
and
that
all
could
come
and
take
some
and
everybody
indeed
hurried
there
and
took
the
oil
down
to
the
last
drop
last
of
all
came
an
old
witch
who
begged
the
queen
to
give
her
a
little
saying
give
me
a
little
oil
too
the
queen
replied
ah
it
is
all
gone
there
is
no
more
the
queen
was
angry
and
full
of
spite
because
her
son
had
not
yet
laughed
the
old
witch
said
again
to
the
queen
let
me
look
in
the
jar
the
queen
opened
the
jar
and
the
old
woman
got
inside
of
it
and
was
all
covered
with
the
dregs
of
the
oil
and
the
queen
son
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
the
old
woman
came
out
saw
the
prince
laughing
and
said
to
him
may
you
never
be
happy
until
you
go
and
find
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
the
son
all
eager
said
to
his
mother
ah
mother
i
shall
have
no
more
peace
until
i
go
and
find
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
she
answered
my
dear
son
how
will
you
go
and
find
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
but
he
would
go
so
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
and
rode
and
rode
until
he
came
to
a
large
gate
he
knocked
and
some
one
within
asked
who
is
there
he
replied
a
soul
created
by
god
the
one
within
said
in
all
the
years
that
i
have
been
here
no
one
has
ever
knocked
at
this
gate
the
prince
repeated
open
for
i
am
a
soul
created
by
god
then
an
old
man
came
down
and
opened
the
gate
he
had
eyelids
that
reached
to
his
feet
and
he
said
my
son
take
down
those
little
forks
and
lift
up
my
eyelids
the
prince
did
so
and
the
old
man
asked
where
are
you
going
my
son
in
this
direction
i
am
going
to
find
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
the
old
man
answered
so
many
have
gone
there
and
never
returned
do
you
wish
not
to
return
too
my
son
take
these
twigs
you
will
meet
some
witches
who
are
sweeping
out
their
oven
with
their
hands
give
them
these
twigs
and
they
will
let
you
pass
the
prince
very
gratefully
took
the
twigs
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
he
journeyed
a
long
time
and
at
last
saw
in
the
distance
the
witches
of
immense
size
who
were
coming
towards
him
he
threw
them
the
twigs
and
they
allowed
him
to
pass
he
continued
his
journey
and
arrived
at
a
gate
larger
than
the
first
here
the
same
thing
occurred
as
at
the
first
one
and
the
old
man
said
well
since
you
will
go
too
take
these
ropes
on
your
way
you
will
encounter
some
witches
drawing
water
with
their
tresses
throw
them
these
ropes
and
they
will
let
you
pass
everything
happened
as
the
old
man
said
the
prince
passed
the
witches
continued
his
journey
and
came
to
a
third
gate
larger
than
the
second
here
an
old
man
with
eyelids
longer
than
the
other
two
gave
him
a
bag
of
bread
and
one
of
tallow
saying
take
this
bag
of
bread
you
will
meet
some
large
dogs
throw
them
the
bread
and
they
will
let
you
pass
then
you
will
come
to
a
large
gate
with
many
rusty
padlocks
then
you
will
see
a
tower
and
in
it
the
love
of
the
three
oranges
when
you
reach
that
place
take
this
tallow
and
anoint
well
the
rusty
padlocks
and
when
you
have
ascended
the
tower
you
will
find
the
oranges
hanging
from
a
nail
there
you
will
also
find
an
old
woman
who
has
a
son
who
is
an
ogre
and
has
eaten
all
the
christians
who
have
come
there
you
see
you
must
be
very
careful
the
prince
well
contented
took
the
bag
of
bread
and
the
tallow
and
rode
away
after
a
long
journey
he
saw
at
a
distance
three
great
dogs
with
their
mouths
wide
open
coming
to
eat
him
he
threw
them
the
bread
and
they
let
him
pass
he
journeyed
on
until
he
came
to
another
large
gate
with
many
rusty
padlocks
he
dismounted
tied
his
horse
to
the
gate
and
began
to
anoint
the
locks
with
the
tallow
until
after
much
creaking
they
opened
the
prince
entered
saw
the
tower
went
up
and
met
an
old
woman
who
said
to
him
dear
son
where
are
you
going
what
have
you
come
here
for
i
have
a
son
who
is
an
ogre
and
will
surely
eat
you
up
while
she
was
uttering
these
words
the
son
arrived
the
old
woman
made
the
prince
hide
under
the
bed
but
the
ogre
perceived
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
house
and
when
he
had
entered
he
began
to
cry
i
smell
a
christian
i
smell
a
christian
son
his
mother
said
there
is
no
one
here
but
he
repeated
his
cry
then
his
mother
to
quiet
him
threw
him
a
piece
of
meat
which
he
ate
like
a
madman
and
while
he
was
busy
eating
she
gave
the
three
oranges
to
the
prince
saying
take
them
my
son
and
escape
at
once
for
he
will
soon
finish
eating
his
meat
and
then
he
will
want
to
eat
you
too
after
she
had
given
him
the
three
oranges
she
repented
of
it
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
she
cried
out
stairs
throw
him
down
lock
crush
him
they
answered
we
will
not
for
he
gave
us
tallow
dogs
devour
him
we
will
not
for
he
gave
us
bread
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
and
the
old
woman
cried
after
him
witch
strangle
him
i
will
not
for
he
gave
me
ropes
witch
kill
him
i
will
not
for
he
gave
me
twigs
the
prince
continued
his
journey
and
on
the
way
became
very
thirsty
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
finally
he
thought
of
opening
one
of
the
oranges
he
did
so
and
out
came
a
beautiful
girl
who
said
to
him
love
give
me
to
drink
he
replied
love
i
have
none
and
she
said
love
i
shall
die
and
she
died
at
once
the
prince
threw
away
the
orange
and
continued
his
journey
and
soon
became
thirsty
again
in
despair
he
opened
another
orange
and
out
sprang
another
girl
more
beautiful
than
the
first
she
too
asked
for
water
and
died
when
the
prince
told
her
he
had
none
to
give
her
then
he
continued
his
way
saying
the
next
time
i
surely
do
not
want
to
lose
her
when
he
became
thirsty
again
he
waited
until
he
reached
a
well
then
he
opened
the
last
orange
and
there
appeared
a
girl
more
beautiful
than
the
first
two
when
she
asked
for
water
he
gave
her
the
water
of
the
well
then
took
her
out
of
the
orange
put
her
on
horseback
with
himself
and
started
for
home
when
he
was
nearly
there
he
said
to
her
see
i
will
leave
you
here
for
a
time
under
these
two
trees
one
had
leaves
of
gold
and
silver
fruit
and
the
other
gold
fruit
and
silver
leaves
then
he
made
her
a
nice
couch
and
left
her
resting
between
the
two
trees
now
said
he
i
must
go
to
my
mother
to
tell
her
that
i
have
found
you
then
i
will
come
for
you
and
we
shall
be
married
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
to
his
mother
now
while
he
was
gone
an
old
witch
approached
the
girl
and
said
ah
dear
daughter
let
me
comb
your
hair
the
young
girl
replied
no
the
like
of
me
do
not
wish
it
again
she
said
come
my
dear
daughter
let
me
comb
you
tired
of
being
asked
so
often
by
the
old
woman
the
girl
at
last
allowed
her
to
comb
her
hair
and
what
did
that
monster
of
an
old
witch
take
it
into
her
head
to
do
she
stuck
a
pin
through
the
girl
temples
from
side
to
side
and
the
girl
at
once
was
changed
into
a
dove
what
did
this
wretch
of
an
old
woman
then
do
she
got
into
the
couch
in
the
place
of
the
young
girl
who
flew
away
meanwhile
the
prince
reached
his
mother
house
and
she
said
to
him
dear
son
where
have
you
been
how
have
you
spent
all
this
time
ah
my
mother
said
he
what
a
lovely
girl
i
have
for
my
wife
dear
son
where
have
you
left
her

of
one
are
of
gold
and
the
fruit
is
silver
the
leaves
of
the
other
one
are
silver
and
the
fruit
gold
then
the
queen
gave
a
grand
banquet

many
guests
and
made
ready
many
carriages
to
go
and
bring
the
young
girl

couch
between
the
trees
and
the
white
dove
on

of
them

to
the
heart
and
ashamed
at

the
ugly
old
woman
his
father
and
mother
to

him
took

the
lucky
who
by
virtue
of
a
cat
acquires
a
powerful
kingdom
there
was
once
in
bohemia
a
very
poor
lady
named
soriana
who
had
three
sons
one
was
called
dusolino
the
other
tesifone
and
the
third
constantine
the
lucky
she
owned
nothing
valuable
in
the
world
but
three
things
a
a
and
a
cat
when
soriana
laden
with
years
came
to
die
she
made
her
last
testament
and
left
to
dusolino
her
eldest
son
the
to
tesifone
the
and
to
constantine
the
cat
when
the
mother
was
dead
and
buried
the
neighbors
as
they
had
need
borrowed
now
the
now
the
and
because
they
knew
that
the
owners
were
very
poor
they
made
them
a
cake
which
dusolino
and
tesifone
ate
giving
none
to
constantine
the
youngest
brother
and
if
constantine
asked
them
for
anything
they
told
him
to
go
to
his
cat
which
would
get
it
for
him
wherefore
poor
constantine
and
his
cat
suffered
greatly
now
the
cat
which
was
enchanted
moved
to
compassion
for
constantine
and
angry
at
the
two
brothers
who
treated
him
so
cruelly
said
constantine
do
not
be
downcast
for
i
will
provide
for
your
support
and
my
own
and
leaving
the
house
the
cat
went
out
into
the
fields
and
pretending
to
sleep
caught
a
hare
that
passed
and
killed
it
thence
going
to
the
royal
palace
and
seeing
some
of
the
courtiers
the
cat
said
that
she
wished
to
speak
with
the
king
who
when
he
heard
that
a
cat
wished
to
speak
to
him
had
her
shown
into
his
presence
and
asked
her
what
she
wished
the
cat
replied
that
her
master
constantine
had
sent
him
a
hare
which
he
had
caught
the
king
accepted
the
gift
and
asked
who
this
constantine
was
the
cat
replied
that
he
was
a
man
who
had
no
superior
in
goodness
beauty
and
power
wherefore
the
king
treated
the
cat
very
well
giving
her
to
eat
and
drink
bountifully
when
the
cat
had
satisfied
her
hunger
she
slyly
filled
with
her
paw
unseen
by
any
one
the
bag
that
hung
at
her
side
and
taking
leave
of
the
king
carried
it
to
constantine
when
the
brothers
saw
the
food
over
which
constantine
exulted
they
asked
him
to
share
it
with
them
but
he
refused
rendering
them
tit
for
tat
on
which
account
there
arose
between
them
great
envy
that
continually
gnawed
their
hearts
now
constantine
although
handsome
in
his
face
nevertheless
from
the
privation
he
had
suffered
was
covered
with
scabs
and
scurf
which
caused
him
great
annoyance
but
going
with
his
cat
to
the
river
she
licked
him
carefully
from
head
to
foot
and
combed
his
hair
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
entirely
cured
the
cat
as
we
said
above
continued
to
carry
gifts
to
the
royal
palace
and
thus
supported
her
master
but
after
a
time
she
wearied
of
running
up
and
down
so
much
and
feared
that
she
would
annoy
the
courtiers
so
she
said
to
her
master
sir
if
you
will
do
what
i
order
i
will
make
you
rich
in
a
short
time
how
said
her
master
the
cat
replied
come
with
me
and
do
not
ask
any
more
for
i
am
ready
to
enrich
you
so
they
went
together
to
the
stream
which
was
near
the
royal
palace
and
the
cat
stripped
her
master
and
with
his
agreement
threw
him
into
the
river
and
then
began
to
cry
out
in
a
loud
voice
help
help
messer
constantine
is
drowning
the
king
hearing
this
and
remembering
that
he
had
often
received
presents
from
him
sent
his
people
at
once
to
aid
him
when
messer
constantine
was
taken
out
of
the
water
and
dressed
in
fine
clothes
he
was
taken
to
the
king
who
received
him
cordially
and
asked
him
why
he
had
been
thrown
into
the
river
constantine
could
not
answer
for
grief
but
the
cat
which
was
always
at
his
side
said
know
o
king
that
some
robbers
learned
from
spies
that
my
master
was
loaded
with
jewels
which
he
was
coming
to
present
to
you
they
robbed
him
of
all
and
threw
him
into
the
river
thinking
to
kill
him
but
thanks
to
these
gentlemen
he
has
escaped
from
death
the
king
hearing
this
ordered
that
he
should
be
well
cared
for
and
seeing
that
he
was
handsome
and
knowing
him
to
be
wealthy
he
concluded
to
give
him
elisetta
his
daughter
for
a
wife
endowing
her
with
jewels
and
most
beautiful
garments
after
the
wedding
festivities
had
been
ended
the
king
had
ten
mules
loaded
with
money
and
five
with
costly
apparel
and
sent
his
daughter
to
her
husband
home
accompanied
by
a
great
retinue
constantine
seeing
that
he
had
become
so
wealthy
and
honored
did
not
know
where
to
lead
his
wife
and
took
counsel
with
his
cat
which
said
do
not
fear
my
master
for
we
shall
provide
for
everything
so
they
all
set
out
gayly
on
horseback
and
the
cat
ran
hastily
before
them
and
having
left
the
company
some
distance
behind
met
some
horsemen
to
whom
she
said
what
are
you
doing
here
wretched
men
depart
quickly
for
a
large
band
of
people
are
coming
and
will
take
you
prisoners
they
are
near
by
you
can
hear
the
noise
of
the
neighing
horses
the
horsemen
said
in
terror
what
must
we
do
then
the
cat
replied
do
this
if
you
are
asked
whose
horsemen
you
are
answer
boldly
messer
constantine
and
you
will
not
be
molested
then
the
cat
went
on
and
found
a
large
flock
of
sheep
and
did
the
same
with
their
owners
and
said
the
same
thing
to
all
those
whom
she
found
in
the
road
the
people
who
were
escorting
elisetta
asked
the
horsemen
whose
knights
are
you
and
whose
are
so
many
fine
flocks
and
all
with
one
accord
replied
messer
constantine
then
those
who
accompanied
the
bride
said
so
then
messer
constantine
we
are
beginning
to
enter
your
territory
and
he
nodded
his
head
and
replied
in
like
manner
to
all
that
he
was
asked
wherefore
the
company
judged
him
to
be
very
wealthy
at
last
the
cat
came
to
a
very
fine
castle
and
found
there
but
few
servants
to
whom
she
said
what
are
you
doing
good
men
do
you
not
perceive
the
destruction
which
is
impending
what
asked
the
servants
before
an
hour
passes
a
host
of
soldiers
will
come
here
and
cut
you
to
pieces
do
you
not
hear
the
horses
neighing
do
you
not
see
the
dust
in
the
air
if
you
do
not
wish
to
perish
take
my
advice
and
you
will
be
saved
if
any
one
asks
you
whose
this
castle
is
say
messer
constantine
so
they
did
and
when
the
noble
company
reached
the
handsome
castle
they
asked
the
keepers
whose
it
was
and
all
answered
boldly
messer
constantine
the
lucky
then
they
entered
and
were
honorably
entertained
now
the
castellan
of
that
place
was
signor
valentino
a
brave
soldier
who
a
short
time
before
had
left
the
castle
to
bring
home
the
wife
he
had
lately
married
and
to
his
misfortune
before
he
reached
the
place
where
his
wife
was
he
was
overtaken
on
the
way
by
a
sudden
and
fatal
accident
from
which
he
straightway
died
and
constantine
remained
master
of
the
castle
before
long
morando
king
of
bohemia
died
and
the
people
elected
for
their
king
constantine
the
lucky
because
he
was
the
husband
of
elisetta
the
dead
king
daughter
to
whom
the
kingdom
fell
by
right
of
succession
and
so
constantine
from
being
poor
and
a
beggar
remained
lord
and
king
and
lived
a
long
time
with
his
elisetta
leaving
children
by
her
to
succeed
him

kingdom

where
the
story
is
as
follows
a
certain
tailor
to
the
king
had
among
others
an
apprentice
named
nedui
on
one
occasion
the
king
officers
brought
warm
bread
and
honey
which
the
tailor
and
his
apprentices
ate
without
waiting
for
nedui
who
happened
to
be
absent
when
one
of
the
officers
asked
why
they
did
not
wait
for
nedui
the
tailor
answered
that
he
did
not
like
honey
when
nedui
returned
and
learned
what
had
taken
place
he
determined
to
be
revenged
and
when
he
had
a
chance
he
told
the
officer
who
superintended
the
work
done
for
the
king
that
the
tailor
often
went
into
a
frenzy
and
beat
or
killed
the
bystanders
the
officer
said
that
if
they
could
tell
when
the
attack
was
coming
on
they
would
bind
him
so
that
he
could
not
injure
any
one
nedui
said
it
was
easy
to
tell
the
first
symptoms
were
the
tailor
looking
here
and
there
beating
the
ground
with
his
hands
and
getting
up
and
seizing
his
seat
the
next
day
nedui
securely
hid
his
master
shears
and
when
the
latter
began
to
look
for
them
and
feel
about
on
the
floor
and
lift
up
his
seat
the
officer
called
in
the
guard
and
had
the
tailor
bound
and
for
fear
he
should
beat
any
one
soundly
thrashed
at
last
the
poor
tailor
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
explanation
and
when
he
asked
nedui
when
did
you
know
me
to
be
insane
the
latter
responded
when
did
you
know
me
not
to

up
half
a

always
hit
what

long
steps
that
when

give
his
daughter
to
the
youth
in

called
on
him
to
fulfil
his
promise
to
him
the
youth
gives

half
of
his
treasures
and

half
of
the
crown
he
had
won
the

about
to
cut
his
bride
in
