i

first
english

you
have
stayed
at
miss
worsley
hester
yes
lady
caroline
lady
caroline
you
have
no
country
houses
i
am
told
in
america
hester
we
have
not
many
lady
caroline
have
you
any
country
what
we
should
call
country
hester
we
have
the
largest
country
in
the
world
lady
caroline
they
used
to
tell
us
at
school
that
some
of
our
states
are
as
big
as
france
and
england
put
together
lady
caroline
ah
you
must
find
it
very
draughty
i
should
fancy
sir
john
john
you
should
have
your
muffler
what
is
the
use
of
my
always
knitting
mufflers
for
you
if
you
won
t
wear
them
sir
john
i
am
quite
warm
caroline
i
assure
you
lady
caroline
i
think
not
john
well
you
couldn
t
come
to
a
more
charming
place
than
this
miss
worsley
though
the
house
is
excessively
damp
quite
unpardonably
damp
and
dear
lady
hunstanton
is
sometimes
a
little
lax
about
the
people
she
asks
down
here
sir
john
jane
mixes
too
much
lord
illingworth
of
course
is
a
man
of
high
distinction
it
is
a
privilege
to
meet
him
and
that
member
of
parliament
sir
john
kelvil
my
love
kelvil
lady
caroline
he
must
be
quite
respectable
one
has
never
heard
his
name
before
in
the
whole
course
of
one
s
life
which
speaks
volumes
for
a
man
nowadays
but
allonby
is
hardly
a
very
suitable
person
hester
i
dislike
allonby
i
dislike
her
more
than
i
can
say
lady
caroline
i
am
not
sure
miss
worsley
that
foreigners
like
yourself
should
cultivate
likes
or
dislikes
about
the
people
they
are
invited
to
meet
allonby
is
very
well
born
she
is
a
niece
of
lord
brancaster
s
it
is
said
of
course
that
she
ran
away
twice
before
she
was
married
but
you
know
how
unfair
people
often
are
i
myself
don
t
believe
she
ran
away
more
than
once
hester
arbuthnot
is
very
charming
lady
caroline
ah
yes
the
young
man
who
has
a
post
in
a
bank
lady
hunstanton
is
most
kind
in
asking
him
here
and
lord
illingworth
seems
to
have
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
him
i
am
not
sure
however
that
jane
is
right
in
taking
him
out
of
his
position
in
my
young
days
miss
worsley
one
never
met
any
one
in
society
who
worked
for
their
living
it
was
not
considered
the
thing
hester
in
america
those
are
the
people
we
respect
most
lady
caroline
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
hester
arbuthnot
has
a
beautiful
nature
he
is
so
simple
so
sincere
he
has
one
of
the
most
beautiful
natures
i
have
ever
come
across
it
is
a
privilege
to
meet
lady
caroline
it
is
not
customary
in
england
miss
worsley
for
a
young
lady
to
speak
with
such
enthusiasm
of
any
person
of
the
opposite
sex
english
women
conceal
their
feelings
till
after
they
are
married
they
show
them
then
hester
do
you
in
england
allow
no
friendship
to
exist
between
a
young
man
and
a
young
girl
lady
hunstanton
by
footman
with
shawls
and
a
lady
caroline
we
think
it
very
inadvisable
jane
i
was
just
saying
what
a
pleasant
party
you
have
asked
us
to
meet
you
have
a
wonderful
power
of
selection
it
is
quite
a
gift
lady
hunstanton
dear
caroline
how
kind
of
you
i
think
we
all
do
fit
in
very
nicely
together
and
i
hope
our
charming
american
visitor
will
carry
back
pleasant
recollections
of
our
english
country
life
the
cushion
there
francis
and
my
shawl
the
shetland
get
the
shetland
footman
for
gerald
arbuthnot
gerald
lady
hunstanton
i
have
such
good
news
to
tell
you
lord
illingworth
has
just
offered
to
make
me
his
secretary
lady
hunstanton
his
secretary
that
is
good
news
indeed
gerald
it
means
a
very
brilliant
future
in
store
for
you
your
dear
mother
will
be
delighted
i
really
must
try
and
induce
her
to
come
up
here
do
you
think
she
would
gerald
i
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
her
to
go
anywhere
gerald
oh
i
am
sure
she
would
lady
hunstanton
if
she
knew
lord
illingworth
had
made
me
such
an
offer
footman
with
lady
hunstanton
i
will
write
and
tell
her
about
it
and
ask
her
to
come
up
and
meet
him
just
wait
francis
lady
caroline
that
is
a
very
wonderful
opening
for
so
young
a
man
as
you
are
arbuthnot
gerald
it
is
indeed
lady
caroline
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
show
myself
worthy
of
it
lady
caroline
i
trust
so
gerald
hester
have
not
congratulated
me
yet
miss
worsley
hester
are
you
very
pleased
about
it
gerald
of
course
i
am
it
means
everything
to
that
were
out
of
the
reach
of
hope
before
may
be
within
hope
s
reach
now
hester
nothing
should
be
out
of
the
reach
of
hope
life
is
a
hope
lady
hunstanton
i
fancy
caroline
that
diplomacy
is
what
lord
illingworth
is
aiming
at
i
heard
that
he
was
offered
vienna
but
that
may
not
be
true
lady
caroline
i
don
t
think
that
england
should
be
represented
abroad
by
an
unmarried
man
jane
it
might
lead
to
complications
lady
hunstanton
you
are
too
nervous
caroline
believe
me
you
are
too
nervous
besides
lord
illingworth
may
marry
any
day
i
was
in
hopes
he
would
have
married
lady
kelso
but
i
believe
he
said
her
family
was
too
large
or
was
it
her
feet
i
forget
which
i
regret
it
very
much
she
was
made
to
be
an
ambassador
s
wife
lady
caroline
she
certainly
has
a
wonderful
faculty
of
remembering
people
s
names
and
forgetting
their
faces
lady
hunstanton
well
that
is
very
natural
caroline
is
it
not
tell
henry
to
wait
for
an
answer
i
have
written
a
line
to
your
dear
mother
gerald
to
tell
her
your
good
news
and
to
say
she
really
must
come
to
dinner
gerald
that
is
awfully
kind
of
you
lady
hunstanton
hester
will
you
come
for
a
stroll
miss
worsley
hester
with
pleasure
gerald
lady
hunstanton
i
am
very
much
gratified
at
gerald
arbuthnot
s
good
fortune
he
is
quite
a
of
mine
and
i
am
particularly
pleased
that
lord
illingworth
should
have
made
the
offer
of
his
own
accord
without
my
suggesting
anything
nobody
likes
to
be
asked
favours
i
remember
poor
charlotte
pagden
making
herself
quite
unpopular
one
season
because
she
had
a
french
governess
she
wanted
to
recommend
to
every
one
lady
caroline
i
saw
the
governess
jane
lady
pagden
sent
her
to
me
it
was
before
eleanor
came
out
she
was
far
too
to
be
in
any
respectable
household
i
don
t
wonder
lady
pagden
was
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
lady
hunstanton
ah
that
explains
it
lady
caroline
john
the
grass
is
too
damp
for
you
you
had
better
go
and
put
on
your
overshoes
at
once
sir
john
i
am
quite
comfortable
caroline
i
assure
you
lady
caroline
you
must
allow
me
to
be
the
best
judge
of
that
john
pray
do
as
i
tell
you
sir
john
up
and
goes
lady
hunstanton
you
spoil
him
caroline
you
do
indeed
allonby
lady
stutfield
mrs
allonby
well
dear
i
hope
you
like
the
park
it
is
said
to
be
well
timbered
allonby
the
trees
are
wonderful
lady
hunstanton
lady
stutfield
quite
quite
wonderful
allonby
but
somehow
i
feel
sure
that
if
i
lived
in
the
country
for
six
months
i
should
become
so
unsophisticated
that
no
one
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
me
lady
hunstanton
i
assure
you
dear
that
the
country
has
not
that
effect
at
all
why
it
was
from
melthorpe
which
is
only
two
miles
from
here
that
lady
belton
eloped
with
lord
fethersdale
i
remember
the
occurrence
perfectly
poor
lord
belton
died
three
days
afterwards
of
joy
or
gout
i
forget
which
we
had
a
large
party
staying
here
at
the
time
so
we
were
all
very
much
interested
in
the
whole
affair
allonby
i
think
to
elope
is
cowardly
it
s
running
away
from
danger
and
danger
has
become
so
rare
in
modern
life
lady
caroline
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
young
women
of
the
present
day
seem
to
make
it
the
sole
object
of
their
lives
to
be
always
playing
with
fire
allonby
the
one
advantage
of
playing
with
fire
lady
caroline
is
that
one
never
gets
even
singed
it
is
the
people
who
don
t
know
how
to
play
with
it
who
get
burned
up
lady
stutfield
yes
i
see
that
it
is
very
very
helpful
lady
hunstanton
i
don
t
know
how
the
world
would
get
on
with
such
a
theory
as
that
dear
allonby
lady
stutfield
ah
the
world
was
made
for
men
and
not
for
women
allonby
oh
don
t
say
that
lady
stutfield
we
have
a
much
better
time
than
they
have
there
are
far
more
things
forbidden
to
us
than
are
forbidden
to
them
lady
stutfield
yes
that
is
quite
quite
true
i
had
not
thought
of
that
sir
john
mr
kelvil
lady
hunstanton
well
kelvil
have
you
got
through
your
work
kelvil
i
have
finished
my
writing
for
the
day
lady
hunstanton
it
has
been
an
arduous
task
the
demands
on
the
time
of
a
public
man
are
very
heavy
nowadays
very
heavy
indeed
and
i
don
t
think
they
meet
with
adequate
recognition
lady
caroline
john
have
you
got
your
overshoes
on
sir
john
yes
my
love
lady
caroline
i
think
you
had
better
come
over
here
john
it
is
more
sheltered
sir
john
i
am
quite
comfortable
caroline
lady
caroline
i
think
not
john
you
had
better
sit
beside
me
sir
john
and
goes
lady
stutfield
and
what
have
you
been
writing
about
this
morning
kelvil
kelvil
on
the
usual
subject
lady
stutfield
on
purity
lady
stutfield
that
must
be
such
a
very
very
interesting
thing
to
write
about
kelvil
it
is
the
one
subject
of
really
national
importance
nowadays
lady
stutfield
i
purpose
addressing
my
constituents
on
the
question
before
parliament
meets
i
find
that
the
poorer
classes
of
this
country
display
a
marked
desire
for
a
higher
ethical
standard
lady
stutfield
how
quite
quite
nice
of
them
lady
caroline
are
you
in
favour
of
women
taking
part
in
politics
kettle
sir
john
kelvil
my
love
kelvil
kelvil
the
growing
influence
of
women
is
the
one
reassuring
thing
in
our
political
life
lady
caroline
women
are
always
on
the
side
of
morality
public
and
private
lady
stutfield
it
is
so
very
very
gratifying
to
hear
you
say
that
lady
hunstanton
ah
yes
moral
qualities
in
is
the
important
thing
i
am
afraid
caroline
that
dear
lord
illingworth
doesn
t
value
the
moral
qualities
in
women
as
much
as
he
should
lord
illingworth
lady
stutfield
the
world
says
that
lord
illingworth
is
very
very
wicked
lord
illingworth
but
what
world
says
that
lady
stutfield
it
must
be
the
next
world
this
world
and
i
are
on
excellent
terms
down
mrs
allonby
lady
stutfield
every
one
know
says
you
are
very
very
wicked
lord
illingworth
it
is
perfectly
monstrous
the
way
people
go
about
nowadays
saying
things
against
one
behind
one
s
back
that
are
absolutely
and
entirely
true
lady
hunstanton
dear
lord
illingworth
is
quite
hopeless
lady
stutfield
i
have
given
up
trying
to
reform
him
it
would
take
a
public
company
with
a
board
of
directors
and
a
paid
secretary
to
do
that
but
you
have
the
secretary
already
lord
illingworth
haven
t
you
gerald
arbuthnot
has
told
us
of
his
good
fortune
it
is
really
most
kind
of
you
lord
illingworth
oh
don
t
say
that
lady
hunstanton
kind
is
a
dreadful
word
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
young
arbuthnot
the
moment
i
met
him
and
he
ll
be
of
considerable
use
to
me
in
something
i
am
foolish
enough
to
think
of
doing
lady
hunstanton
he
is
an
admirable
young
man
and
his
mother
is
one
of
my
dearest
friends
he
has
just
gone
for
a
walk
with
our
pretty
american
she
is
very
pretty
is
she
not
lady
caroline
far
too
pretty
these
american
girls
carry
off
all
the
good
matches
why
can
t
they
stay
in
their
own
country
they
are
always
telling
us
it
is
the
paradise
of
women
lord
illingworth
it
is
lady
caroline
that
is
why
like
eve
they
are
so
extremely
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
lady
caroline
who
are
miss
worsley
s
parents
lord
illingworth
american
women
are
wonderfully
clever
in
concealing
their
parents
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
lord
illingworth
what
do
you
mean
miss
worsley
caroline
is
an
orphan
her
father
was
a
very
wealthy
millionaire
or
philanthropist
or
both
i
believe
who
entertained
my
son
quite
hospitably
when
he
visited
boston
i
don
t
know
how
he
made
his
money
originally
kelvil
i
fancy
in
american
dry
goods
lady
hunstanton
what
are
american
dry
goods
lord
illingworth
american
novels
lady
hunstanton
how
very
singular
well
from
whatever
source
her
large
fortune
came
i
have
a
great
esteem
for
miss
worsley
she
dresses
exceedingly
well
all
americans
do
dress
well
they
get
their
clothes
in
paris
allonby
they
say
lady
hunstanton
that
when
good
americans
die
they
go
to
paris
lady
hunstanton
indeed
and
when
bad
americans
die
where
do
they
go
to
lord
illingworth
oh
they
go
to
america
kelvil
i
am
afraid
you
don
t
appreciate
america
lord
illingworth
it
is
a
very
remarkable
country
especially
considering
its
youth
lord
illingworth
the
youth
of
america
is
their
oldest
tradition
it
has
been
going
on
now
for
three
hundred
years
to
hear
them
talk
one
would
imagine
they
were
in
their
first
childhood
as
far
as
civilisation
goes
they
are
in
their
second
kelvil
there
is
undoubtedly
a
great
deal
of
corruption
in
american
politics
i
suppose
you
allude
to
that
lord
illingworth
i
wonder
lady
hunstanton
politics
are
in
a
sad
way
everywhere
i
am
told
they
certainly
are
in
england
dear
cardew
is
ruining
the
country
i
wonder
cardew
allows
him
i
am
sure
lord
illingworth
you
don
t
think
that
uneducated
people
should
be
allowed
to
have
votes
lord
illingworth
i
think
they
are
the
only
people
who
should
kelvil
do
you
take
no
side
then
in
modern
politics
lord
illingworth
lord
illingworth
one
should
never
take
sides
in
anything
kelvil
taking
sides
is
the
beginning
of
sincerity
and
earnestness
follows
shortly
afterwards
and
the
human
being
becomes
a
bore
however
the
house
of
commons
really
does
very
little
harm
you
can
t
make
people
good
by
act
of
parliament
is
something
kelvil
you
can
not
deny
that
the
house
of
commons
has
always
shown
great
sympathy
with
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
lord
illingworth
that
is
its
special
vice
that
is
the
special
vice
of
the
age
one
should
sympathise
with
the
joy
the
beauty
the
colour
of
life
the
less
said
about
life
s
sores
the
better
kelvil
kelvil
still
our
east
end
is
a
very
important
problem
lord
illingworth
quite
so
it
is
the
problem
of
slavery
and
we
are
trying
to
solve
it
by
amusing
the
slaves
lady
hunstanton
certainly
a
great
deal
may
be
done
by
means
of
cheap
entertainments
as
you
say
lord
illingworth
dear
daubeny
our
rector
here
provides
with
the
assistance
of
his
curates
really
admirable
recreations
for
the
poor
during
the
winter
and
much
good
may
be
done
by
means
of
a
magic
lantern
or
a
missionary
or
some
popular
amusement
of
that
kind
lady
caroline
i
am
not
at
all
in
favour
of
amusements
for
the
poor
jane
blankets
and
coals
are
sufficient
there
is
too
much
love
of
pleasure
amongst
the
upper
classes
as
it
is
health
is
what
we
want
in
modern
life
the
tone
is
not
healthy
not
healthy
at
all
kelvil
you
are
quite
right
lady
caroline
lady
caroline
i
believe
i
am
usually
right
allonby
horrid
word
lord
illingworth
silliest
word
in
our
language
and
one
knows
so
well
the
popular
idea
of
health
the
english
country
gentleman
galloping
after
a
unspeakable
in
full
pursuit
of
the
uneatable
kelvil
may
i
ask
lord
illingworth
if
you
regard
the
house
of
lords
as
a
better
institution
than
the
house
of
commons
lord
illingworth
a
much
better
institution
of
course
we
in
the
house
of
lords
are
never
in
touch
with
public
opinion
that
makes
us
a
civilised
body
kelvil
are
you
serious
in
putting
forward
such
a
view
lord
illingworth
quite
serious
kelvil
mrs
allonby
vulgar
habit
that
is
people
have
nowadays
of
asking
one
after
one
has
given
them
an
idea
whether
one
is
serious
or
not
nothing
is
serious
except
passion
the
intellect
is
not
a
serious
thing
and
never
has
been
it
is
an
instrument
on
which
one
plays
that
is
all
the
only
serious
form
of
intellect
i
know
is
the
british
intellect
and
on
the
british
intellect
the
illiterates
play
the
drum
lady
hunstanton
what
are
you
saying
lord
illingworth
about
the
drum
lord
illingworth
i
was
merely
talking
to
allonby
about
the
leading
articles
in
the
london
newspapers
lady
hunstanton
but
do
you
believe
all
that
is
written
in
the
newspapers
lord
illingworth
i
do
nowadays
it
is
only
the
unreadable
that
occurs
mrs
allonby
lady
hunstanton
are
you
going
allonby
allonby
just
as
far
as
the
conservatory
lord
illingworth
told
me
this
morning
that
there
was
an
orchid
there
as
beautiful
as
the
seven
deadly
sins
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
i
hope
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
i
will
certainly
speak
to
the
gardener
allonby
lord
illingworth
lady
caroline
remarkable
type
allonby
lady
hunstanton
she
lets
her
clever
tongue
run
away
with
her
sometimes
lady
caroline
is
that
the
only
thing
jane
allonby
allows
to
run
away
with
her
lady
hunstanton
i
hope
so
caroline
i
am
sure
lord
alfred
dear
lord
alfred
do
join
us
lord
alfred
down
lady
stutfield
lady
caroline
you
believe
good
of
every
one
jane
it
is
a
great
fault
lady
stutfield
do
you
really
really
think
lady
caroline
that
one
should
believe
evil
of
every
one
lady
caroline
i
think
it
is
much
safer
to
do
so
lady
stutfield
until
of
course
people
are
found
out
to
be
good
but
that
requires
a
great
deal
of
investigation
nowadays
lady
stutfield
but
there
is
so
much
unkind
scandal
in
modern
life
lady
caroline
lord
illingworth
remarked
to
me
last
night
at
dinner
that
the
basis
of
every
scandal
is
an
absolutely
immoral
certainty
kelvil
lord
illingworth
is
of
course
a
very
brilliant
man
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
lacking
in
that
fine
faith
in
the
nobility
and
purity
of
life
which
is
so
important
in
this
century
lady
stutfield
yes
quite
quite
important
is
it
not
kelvil
he
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
does
not
appreciate
the
beauty
of
our
english
i
would
say
that
he
was
tainted
with
foreign
ideas
on
the
subject
lady
stutfield
there
is
nothing
nothing
like
the
beauty
of
is
there
kelvil
it
is
the
mainstay
of
our
moral
system
in
england
lady
stutfield
without
it
we
would
become
like
our
neighbours
lady
stutfield
that
would
be
so
so
sad
would
it
not
kelvil
i
am
afraid
too
that
lord
illingworth
regards
woman
simply
as
a
toy
now
i
have
never
regarded
woman
as
a
toy
woman
is
the
intellectual
helpmeet
of
man
in
public
as
in
private
life
without
her
we
should
forget
the
true
ideals
down
lady
stutfield
lady
stutfield
i
am
so
very
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
lady
caroline

married

join
them
later
on
no
doubt
kelvil
if
my
public
engagements
permit
me
lady
caroline
your
public
life
must
be
a
great
source
of
gratification
to
kettle
sir
john
kelvil
my
love
kelvil
lady
stutfield
lord
alfred
how
very
very
charming
those
cigarettes
of
yours

lord

lord
alfred
they
are
awfully
expensive
i
can
only
afford
them
when
i
m
in
debt
lady
stutfield
it
must
be
terribly
terribly
distressing
to
be
in
debt
lord
alfred
one
must
have
some
occupation
nowadays
if
i
hadn
t
my
debts
i
shouldn
t
have
anything
to
think
about
all
the
chaps
i
know
are
in
debt
lady
stutfield
but
don
t
the
people
to
whom
you
owe
the
money
give
you
a
great
great
deal
of
annoyance
lord
alfred
oh
no
they
write
i
don
t
lady
stutfield
how
very
very
strange
lady
hunstanton
ah
here
is
a
letter
caroline
from
dear
arbuthnot
she
won
t
dine
i
am
so
sorry
but
she
will
come
in
the
evening
i
am
very
pleased
indeed
she
is
one
of
the
sweetest
of
women
writes
a
beautiful
hand
too
so
large
so
firm
letter
lady
caroline
lady
caroline
at
a
little
lacking
in
femininity
jane
femininity
is
the
quality
i
admire
most
in
women
lady
hunstanton
back
letter
and
leaving
it
on
oh
she
is
very
feminine
caroline
and
so
good
too
you
should
hear
what
the
archdeacon
says
of
her
he
regards
her
as
his
right
hand
in
the
parish
speaks
to
in
the
yellow
shall
we
all
go
in
lady
stutfield
shall
we
go
in
to
tea
lady
stutfield
with
pleasure
lady
hunstanton
rise
and
proceed
to
go
sir
john
offers
to
carry
lady
stutfield
s
cloak
lady
caroline
john
if
you
would
allow
your
nephew
to
look
after
lady
stutfield
s
cloak
you
might
help
me
with
my
workbasket
lord
illingworth
mrs
allonby
sir
john
certainly
my
love
allonby
curious
thing
plain
women
are
always
jealous
of
their
husbands
beautiful
women
never
are
lord
illingworth
beautiful
women
never
have
time
they
are
always
so
occupied
in
being
jealous
of
other
people
s
husbands
allonby
i
should
have
thought
lady
caroline
would
have
grown
tired
of
conjugal
anxiety
by
this
time
sir
john
is
her
fourth
lord
illingworth
so
much
marriage
is
certainly
not
becoming
twenty
years
of
romance
make
a
woman
look
like
a
ruin
but
twenty
years
of
marriage
make
her
something
like
a
public
building
allonby
twenty
years
of
romance
is
there
such
a
thing
lord
illingworth
not
in
our
day
women
have
become
too
brilliant
nothing
spoils
a
romance
so
much
as
a
sense
of
humour
in
the
woman
allonby
or
the
want
of
it
in
the
man
lord
illingworth
you
are
quite
right
in
a
temple
every
one
should
be
serious
except
the
thing
that
is
worshipped
allonby
and
that
should
be
man
lord
illingworth
women
kneel
so
gracefully
men
don
t
allonby
you
are
thinking
of
lady
stutfield
lord
illingworth
i
assure
you
i
have
not
thought
of
lady
stutfield
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
allonby
is
she
such
a
mystery
lord
illingworth
she
is
more
than
a
is
a
mood
allonby
moods
don
t
last
lord
illingworth
it
is
their
chief
charm
hester
gerald
gerald
lord
illingworth
every
one
has
been
congratulating
me
lady
hunstanton
and
lady
caroline
and
every
one
i
hope
i
shall
make
a
good
secretary
lord
illingworth
you
will
be
the
pattern
secretary
gerald
to
allonby
you
enjoy
country
life
miss
worsley
hester
very
much
indeed
allonby
don
t
find
yourself
longing
for
a
london
hester
i
dislike
london
allonby
i
adore
them
the
clever
people
never
listen
and
the
stupid
people
never
talk
hester
i
think
the
stupid
people
talk
a
great
deal
allonby
ah
i
never
listen
lord
illingworth
my
dear
boy
if
i
didn
t
like
you
i
wouldn
t
have
made
you
the
offer
it
is
because
i
like
you
so
much
that
i
want
to
have
you
with
me
hester
gerald
charming
fellow
gerald
arbuthnot
allonby
he
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
but
i
can
t
stand
the
american
young
lady
lord
illingworth
why
allonby
she
told
me
yesterday
and
in
quite
a
loud
voice
too
that
she
was
only
eighteen
it
was
most
annoying
lord
illingworth
one
should
never
trust
a
woman
who
tells
one
her
real
age
a
woman
who
would
tell
one
that
would
tell
one
anything
allonby
she
is
a
puritan
lord
illingworth
ah
that
is
inexcusable
i
don
t
mind
plain
women
being
puritans
it
is
the
only
excuse
they
have
for
being
plain
but
she
is
decidedly
pretty
i
admire
her
immensely
steadfastly
mrs
allonby
allonby
what
a
thoroughly
bad
man
you
must
be
lord
illingworth
what
do
you
call
a
bad
man
allonby
the
sort
of
man
who
admires
innocence
lord
illingworth
and
a
bad
woman
allonby
oh
the
sort
of
woman
a
man
never
gets
tired
of
lord
illingworth
you
are
yourself
allonby
define
us
as
a
sex
lord
illingworth
sphinxes
without
secrets
allonby
does
that
include
the
puritan
women
lord
illingworth
do
you
know
i
don
t
believe
in
the
existence
of
puritan
women
i
don
t
think
there
is
a
woman
in
the
world
who
would
not
be
a
little
flattered
if
one
made
love
to
her
it
is
that
which
makes
women
so
irresistibly
adorable
allonby
you
think
there
is
no
woman
in
the
world
who
would
object
to
being
kissed
lord
illingworth
very
few
allonby
miss
worsley
would
not
let
you
kiss
her
lord
illingworth
are
you
sure
allonby
quite
lord
illingworth
what
do
you
think
she
d
do
if
i
kissed
her
allonby
either
marry
you
or
strike
you
across
the
face
with
her
glove
what
would
you
do
if
she
struck
you
across
the
face
with
her
glove
lord
illingworth
fall
in
love
with
her
probably
allonby
then
it
is
lucky
you
are
not
going
to
kiss
her
lord
illingworth
is
that
a
challenge
allonby
it
is
an
arrow
shot
into
the
air
lord
illingworth
don
t
you
know
that
i
always
succeed
in
whatever
i
try
allonby
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
we
women
adore
failures
they
lean
on
us
lord
illingworth
you
worship
successes
you
cling
to
them
allonby
we
are
the
laurels
to
hide
their
baldness
lord
illingworth
and
they
need
you
always
except
at
the
moment
of
triumph
allonby
they
are
uninteresting
then
lord
illingworth
how
tantalising
you
are
allonby
lord
illingworth
there
is
one
thing
i
shall
always
like
you
for
lord
illingworth
only
one
thing
and
i
have
so
many
bad
qualities
allonby
ah
don
t
be
too
conceited
about
them
you
may
lose
them
as
you
grow
old
lord
illingworth
i
never
intend
to
grow
old
the
soul
is
born
old
but
grows
young
that
is
the
comedy
of
life
allonby
and
the
body
is
born
young
and
grows
old
that
is
life
s
tragedy
lord
illingworth
its
comedy
also
sometimes
but
what
is
the
mysterious
reason
why
you
will
always
like
me
allonby
it
is
that
you
have
never
made
love
to
me
lord
illingworth
i
have
never
done
anything
else
allonby
really
i
have
not
noticed
it
lord
illingworth
how
fortunate
it
might
have
been
a
tragedy
for
both
of
us
allonby
we
should
each
have
survived
lord
illingworth
one
can
survive
everything
nowadays
except
death
and
live
down
anything
except
a
good
reputation
allonby
have
you
tried
a
good
reputation
lord
illingworth
it
is
one
of
the
many
annoyances
to
which
i
have
never
been
subjected
allonby
it
may
come
lord
illingworth
why
do
you
threaten
me
allonby
i
will
tell
you
when
you
have
kissed
the
puritan
francis
tea
is
served
in
the
yellow
my
lord
lord
illingworth
tell
her
ladyship
we
are
coming
in
francis
yes
my
lord
lord
illingworth
shall
we
go
in
to
tea
allonby
do
you
like
such
simple
pleasures
lord
illingworth
i
adore
simple
pleasures
they
are
the
last
refuge
of
the
complex
but
if
you
wish
let
us
stay
here
yes
let
us
stay
here
the
book
of
life
begins
with
a
man
and
a
woman
in
a
garden
allonby
it
ends
with
revelations
lord
illingworth
you
fence
divinely
but
the
button
has
come
of
your
foil
allonby
i
have
still
the
mask
lord
illingworth
it
makes
your
eyes
lovelier
allonby
thank
you
come
lord
illingworth
arbuthnot
s
on
takes
it
up
and
looks
at
what
a
curious
handwriting
it
reminds
me
of
the
handwriting
of
a
woman
i
used
to
know
years
ago
allonby
who
lord
illingworth
oh
no
one
no
one
in
particular
a
woman
of
no
importance
letter
passes
up
the
steps
of
the
terrace
allonby
smile
at
each
act
drop
second
act
scene
at
seated
on
allonby
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
have
got
rid
of
the
men
for
a
little
lady
stutfield
yes
men
persecute
us
dreadfully
don
t
they
allonby
persecute
us
i
wish
they
did
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
allonby
the
annoying
thing
is
that
the
wretches
can
be
perfectly
happy
without
us
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
every
woman
s
duty
never
to
leave
them
alone
for
a
single
moment
except
during
this
short
breathing
space
after
dinner
without
which
i
believe
we
poor
women
would
be
absolutely
worn
to
shadows
servants
with
lady
hunstanton
worn
to
shadows
dear
allonby
yes
lady
hunstanton
it
is
such
a
strain
keeping
men
up
to
the
mark
they
are
always
trying
to
escape
from
us
lady
stutfield
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
we
who
are
always
trying
to
escape
from
them
men
are
so
very
very
heartless
they
know
their
power
and
use
it
lady
caroline
coffee
from
what
stuff
and
nonsense
all
this
about
men
is
the
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
men
in
their
proper
place
allonby
but
what
is
their
proper
place
lady
caroline
lady
caroline
looking
after
their
wives
allonby
allonby
coffee
from
really
and
if
they
re
not
married
lady
caroline
if
they
are
not
married
they
should
be
looking
after
a
wife
it
s
perfectly
scandalous
the
amount
of
bachelors
who
are
going
about
society
there
should
be
a
law
passed
to
compel
them
all
to
marry
within
twelve
months
lady
stutfield
but
if
they
re
in
love
with
some
one
who
perhaps
is
tied
to
another
lady
caroline
in
that
case
lady
stutfield
they
should
be
married
off
in
a
week
to
some
plain
respectable
girl
in
order
to
teach
them
not
to
meddle
with
other
people
s
property
allonby
i
don
t
think
that
we
should
ever
be
spoken
of
as
other
people
s
property
all
men
are
married
women
s
property
that
is
the
only
true
definition
of
what
married
women
s
property
really
is
but
we
don
t
belong
to
any
one
lady
stutfield
oh
i
am
so
very
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
lady
hunstanton
but
do
you
really
think
dear
caroline
that
legislation
would
improve
matters
in
any
way
i
am
told
that
nowadays
all
the
married
men
live
like
bachelors
and
all
the
bachelors
like
married
men
allonby
i
certainly
never
know
one
from
the
other
lady
stutfield
oh
i
think
one
can
always
know
at
once
whether
a
man
has
home
claims
upon
his
life
or
not
i
have
noticed
a
very
very
sad
expression
in
the
eyes
of
so
many
married
men
allonby
ah
all
that
i
have
noticed
is
that
they
are
horribly
tedious
when
they
are
good
husbands
and
abominably
conceited
when
they
are
not
lady
hunstanton
well
i
suppose
the
type
of
husband
has
completely
changed
since
my
young
days
but
i
m
bound
to
state
that
poor
dear
hunstanton
was
the
most
delightful
of
creatures
and
as
good
as
gold
allonby
ah
my
husband
is
a
sort
of
promissory
note
i
m
tired
of
meeting
him
lady
caroline
but
you
renew
him
from
time
to
time
don
t
you
allonby
oh
no
lady
caroline
i
have
only
had
one
husband
as
yet
i
suppose
you
look
upon
me
as
quite
an
amateur
lady
caroline
with
your
views
on
life
i
wonder
you
married
at
all
allonby
so
do
i
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
child
i
believe
you
are
really
very
happy
in
your
married
life
but
that
you
like
to
hide
your
happiness
from
others
allonby
i
assure
you
i
was
horribly
deceived
in
ernest
lady
hunstanton
oh
i
hope
not
dear
i
knew
his
mother
quite
well
she
was
a
stratton
caroline
one
of
lord
crowland
s
daughters
lady
caroline
victoria
stratton
i
remember
her
perfectly
a
silly
woman
with
no
chin
allonby
ah
ernest
has
a
chin
he
has
a
very
strong
chin
a
square
chin
ernest
s
chin
is
far
too
square
lady
stutfield
but
do
you
really
think
a
man
s
chin
can
be
too
square
i
think
a
man
should
look
very
very
strong
and
that
his
chin
should
be
quite
quite
square
allonby
then
you
should
certainly
know
ernest
lady
stutfield
it
is
only
fair
to
tell
you
beforehand
he
has
got
no
conversation
at
all
lady
stutfield
i
adore
silent
men
allonby
oh
ernest
isn
t
silent
he
talks
the
whole
time
but
he
has
got
no
conversation
what
he
talks
about
i
don
t
know
i
haven
t
listened
to
him
for
years
lady
stutfield
have
you
never
forgiven
him
then
how
sad
that
seems
but
all
life
is
very
very
sad
is
it
not
allonby
life
lady
stutfield
is
simply
a
quart
d
made
up
of
exquisite
moments
lady
stutfield
yes
there
are
moments
certainly
but
was
it
something
very
very
wrong
that
allonby
did
did
he
become
angry
with
you
and
say
anything
that
was
unkind
or
true
allonby
oh
dear
no
ernest
is
invariably
calm
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
he
always
gets
on
my
nerves
nothing
is
so
aggravating
as
calmness
there
is
something
positively
brutal
about
the
good
temper
of
most
modern
men
i
wonder
we
women
stand
it
as
well
as
we
do
lady
stutfield
yes
men
s
good
temper
shows
they
are
not
so
sensitive
as
we
are
not
so
finely
strung
it
makes
a
great
barrier
often
between
husband
and
wife
does
it
not
but
i
would
so
much
like
to
know
what
was
the
wrong
thing
allonby
did
allonby
well
i
will
tell
you
if
you
solemnly
promise
to
tell
everybody
else
lady
stutfield
thank
you
thank
you
i
will
make
a
point
of
repeating
it
allonby
when
ernest
and
i
were
engaged
he
swore
to
me
positively
on
his
knees
that
he
had
never
loved
any
one
before
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
i
was
very
young
at
the
time
so
i
didn
t
believe
him
i
needn
t
tell
you
unfortunately
however
i
made
no
enquiries
of
any
kind
till
after
i
had
been
actually
married
four
or
five
months
i
found
out
then
that
what
he
had
told
me
was
perfectly
true
and
that
sort
of
thing
makes
a
man
so
absolutely
uninteresting
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
allonby
men
always
want
to
be
a
woman
s
first
love
that
is
their
clumsy
vanity
we
women
have
a
more
subtle
instinct
about
things
what
we
like
is
to
be
a
man
s
last
romance
lady
stutfield
i
see
what
you
mean
it
s
very
very
beautiful
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
child
you
don
t
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
won
t
forgive
your
husband
because
he
never
loved
any
one
else
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
thing
caroline
i
am
quite
surprised
lady
caroline
oh
women
have
become
so
highly
educated
jane
that
nothing
should
surprise
us
nowadays
except
happy
marriages
they
apparently
are
getting
remarkably
rare
allonby
oh
they
re
quite
out
of
date
lady
stutfield
except
amongst
the
middle
classes
i
have
been
told
allonby
how
like
the
middle
classes
lady
stutfield
it
not
very
like
them
lady
caroline
if
what
you
tell
us
about
the
middle
classes
is
true
lady
stutfield
it
redounds
greatly
to
their
credit
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
in
our
rank
of
life
the
wife
should
be
so
persistently
frivolous
under
the
impression
apparently
that
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
be
it
is
to
that
i
attribute
the
unhappiness
of
so
many
marriages
we
all
know
of
in
society
allonby
do
you
know
lady
caroline
i
don
t
think
the
frivolity
of
the
wife
has
ever
anything
to
do
with
it
more
marriages
are
ruined
nowadays
by
the
common
sense
of
the
husband
than
by
anything
else
how
can
a
woman
be
expected
to
be
happy
with
a
man
who
insists
on
treating
her
as
if
she
were
a
perfectly
rational
being
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
allonby
man
poor
awkward
reliable
necessary
man
belongs
to
a
sex
that
has
been
rational
for
millions
and
millions
of
years
he
can
t
help
himself
it
is
in
his
race
the
history
of
woman
is
very
different
we
have
always
been
picturesque
protests
against
the
mere
existence
of
common
sense
we
saw
its
dangers
from
the
first
lady
stutfield
yes
the
common
sense
of
husbands
is
certainly
most
most
trying
do
tell
me
your
conception
of
the
ideal
husband
i
think
it
would
be
so
very
very
helpful
allonby
the
ideal
husband
there
couldn
t
be
such
a
thing
the
institution
is
wrong
lady
stutfield
the
ideal
man
then
in
his
relations
to
lady
caroline
he
would
probably
be
extremely
realistic
caroline
the
ideal
man
oh
the
ideal
man
should
talk
to
us
as
if
we
were
goddesses
and
treat
us
as
if
we
were
children
he
should
refuse
all
our
serious
requests
and
gratify
every
one
of
our
whims
he
should
encourage
us
to
have
caprices
and
forbid
us
to
have
missions
he
should
always
say
much
more
than
he
means
and
always
mean
much
more
than
he
says
lady
hunstanton
but
how
could
he
do
both
dear
allonby
he
should
never
run
down
other
pretty
women
that
would
show
he
had
no
taste
or
make
one
suspect
that
he
had
too
much
no
he
should
be
nice
about
them
all
but
say
that
somehow
they
don
t
attract
him
lady
stutfield
yes
that
is
always
very
very
pleasant
to
hear
about
other
women
allonby
if
we
ask
him
a
question
about
anything
he
should
give
us
an
answer
all
about
ourselves
he
should
invariably
praise
us
for
whatever
qualities
he
knows
we
haven
t
got
but
he
should
be
pitiless
quite
pitiless
in
reproaching
us
for
the
virtues
that
we
have
never
dreamed
of
possessing
he
should
never
believe
that
we
know
the
use
of
useful
things
that
would
be
unforgiveable
but
he
should
shower
on
us
everything
we
don
t
want
lady
caroline
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
is
to
do
nothing
but
pay
bills
and
compliments
allonby
he
should
persistently
compromise
us
in
public
and
treat
us
with
absolute
respect
when
we
are
alone
and
yet
he
should
be
always
ready
to
have
a
perfectly
terrible
scene
whenever
we
want
one
and
to
become
miserable
absolutely
miserable
at
a
moment
s
notice
and
to
overwhelm
us
with
just
reproaches
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
and
to
be
positively
violent
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
and
to
leave
us
for
ever
at
a
quarter
to
eight
when
we
have
to
go
and
dress
for
dinner
and
when
after
that
one
has
seen
him
for
really
the
last
time
and
he
has
refused
to
take
back
the
little
things
he
has
given
one
and
promised
never
to
communicate
with
one
again
or
to
write
one
any
foolish
letters
he
should
be
perfectly
and
telegraph
to
one
all
day
long
and
send
one
little
notes
every
by
a
private
hansom
and
dine
quite
alone
at
the
club
so
that
every
one
should
know
how
unhappy
he
was
and
after
a
whole
dreadful
week
during
which
one
has
gone
about
everywhere
with
one
s
husband
just
to
show
how
absolutely
lonely
one
was
he
may
be
given
a
third
last
parting
in
the
evening
and
then
if
his
conduct
has
been
quite
irreproachable
and
one
has
behaved
really
badly
to
him
he
should
be
allowed
to
admit
that
he
has
been
entirely
in
the
wrong
and
when
he
has
admitted
that
it
becomes
a
woman
s
duty
to
forgive
and
one
can
do
it
all
over
again
from
the
beginning
with
variations
lady
hunstanton
how
clever
you
are
my
dear
you
never
mean
a
single
word
you
say
lady
stutfield
thank
you
thank
you
it
has
been
quite
quite
entrancing
i
must
try
and
remember
it
all
there
are
such
a
number
of
details
that
are
so
very
very
important
lady
caroline
but
you
have
not
told
us
yet
what
the
reward
of
the
ideal
man
is
to
be
allonby
his
reward
oh
infinite
expectation
that
is
quite
enough
for
him
lady
stutfield
but
men
are
so
terribly
terribly
exacting
are
they
not
allonby
that
makes
no
matter
one
should
never
surrender
lady
stutfield
not
even
to
the
ideal
man
allonby
certainly
not
to
him
unless
of
course
one
wants
to
grow
tired
of
him
lady
stutfield
oh
yes
i
see
that
it
is
very
very
helpful
do
you
think
allonby
i
shall
ever
meet
the
ideal
man
or
are
there
more
than
one
allonby
there
are
just
four
in
london
lady
stutfield
lady
hunstanton
oh
my
dear
allonby
over
to
what
has
happened
do
tell
me
lady
hunstanton
a
low
i
had
completely
forgotten
that
the
american
young
lady
has
been
in
the
room
all
the
time
i
am
afraid
some
of
this
clever
talk
may
have
shocked
her
a
little
allonby
ah
that
will
do
her
so
much
good
lady
hunstanton
let
us
hope
she
didn
t
understand
much
i
think
i
had
better
go
over
and
talk
to
her
and
goes
across
hester
worsley
well
dear
miss
worsley
down
beside
how
quiet
you
have
been
in
your
nice
little
corner
all
this
time
i
suppose
you
have
been
reading
a
book
there
are
so
many
books
here
in
the
library
hester
no
i
have
been
listening
to
the
conversation
lady
hunstanton
you
mustn
t
believe
everything
that
was
said
you
know
dear
hester
i
didn
t
believe
any
of
it
lady
hunstanton
that
is
quite
right
dear
hester
i
couldn
t
believe
that
any
women
could
really
hold
such
views
of
life
as
i
have
heard
from
some
of
your
guests
awkward
lady
hunstanton
i
hear
you
have
such
pleasant
society
in
america
quite
like
our
own
in
places
my
son
wrote
to
me
hester
there
are
cliques
in
america
as
elsewhere
lady
hunstanton
but
true
american
society
consists
simply
of
all
the
good
women
and
good
men
we
have
in
our
country
lady
hunstanton
what
a
sensible
system
and
i
dare
say
quite
pleasant
too
i
am
afraid
in
england
we
have
too
many
artificial
social
barriers
we
don
t
see
as
much
as
we
should
of
the
middle
and
lower
classes
hester
in
america
we
have
no
lower
classes
lady
hunstanton
really
what
a
very
strange
arrangement
allonby
what
is
that
dreadful
girl
talking
about
lady
stutfield
she
is
painfully
natural
is
she
not
lady
caroline
there
are
a
great
many
things
you
haven
t
got
in
america
i
am
told
miss
worsley
they
say
you
have
no
ruins
and
no
curiosities
allonby
lady
stutfield
what
nonsense
they
have
their
mothers
and
their
manners
hester
the
english
aristocracy
supply
us
with
our
curiosities
lady
caroline
they
are
sent
over
to
us
every
summer
regularly
in
the
steamers
and
propose
to
us
the
day
after
they
land
as
for
ruins
we
are
trying
to
build
up
something
that
will
last
longer
than
brick
or
stone
up
to
take
her
fan
from
lady
hunstanton
what
is
that
dear
ah
yes
an
iron
exhibition
is
it
not
at
that
place
that
has
the
curious
name
hester
by
we
are
trying
to
build
up
life
lady
hunstanton
on
a
better
truer
purer
basis
than
life
rests
on
here
this
sounds
strange
to
you
all
no
doubt
how
could
it
sound
other
than
strange
you
rich
people
in
england
you
don
t
know
how
you
are
living
how
could
you
know
you
shut
out
from
your
society
the
gentle
and
the
good
you
laugh
at
the
simple
and
the
pure
living
as
you
all
do
on
others
and
by
them
you
sneer
at
and
if
you
throw
bread
to
the
poor
it
is
merely
to
keep
them
quiet
for
a
season
with
all
your
pomp
and
wealth
and
art
you
don
t
know
how
to
don
t
even
know
that
you
love
the
beauty
that
you
can
see
and
touch
and
handle
the
beauty
that
you
can
destroy
and
do
destroy
but
of
the
unseen
beauty
of
life
of
the
unseen
beauty
of
a
higher
life
you
know
nothing
you
have
lost
life
s
secret
oh
your
english
society
seems
to
me
shallow
selfish
foolish
it
has
blinded
its
eyes
and
stopped
its
ears
it
lies
like
a
leper
in
purple
it
sits
like
a
dead
thing
smeared
with
gold
it
is
all
wrong
all
wrong
lady
stutfield
i
don
t
think
one
should
know
of
these
things
it
is
not
very
very
nice
is
it
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
miss
worsley
i
thought
you
liked
english
society
so
much
you
were
such
a
success
in
it
and
you
were
so
much
admired
by
the
best
people
i
quite
forget
what
lord
henry
weston
said
of
it
was
most
complimentary
and
you
know
what
an
authority
he
is
on
beauty
hester
lord
henry
weston
i
remember
him
lady
hunstanton
a
man
with
a
hideous
smile
and
a
hideous
past
he
is
asked
everywhere
no
is
complete
without
him
what
of
those
whose
ruin
is
due
to
him
they
are
outcasts
they
are
nameless
if
you
met
them
in
the
street
you
would
turn
your
head
away
i
don
t
complain
of
their
punishment
let
all
women
who
have
sinned
be
punished
arbuthnot
from
terrace
behind
in
a
cloak
with
a
lace
veil
over
her
hears
the
last
words
and
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
young
lady
hester
it
is
right
that
they
should
be
punished
but
don
t
let
them
be
the
only
ones
to
suffer
if
a
man
and
woman
have
sinned
let
them
both
go
forth
into
the
desert
to
love
or
loathe
each
other
there
let
them
both
be
branded
set
a
mark
if
you
wish
on
each
but
don
t
punish
the
one
and
let
the
other
go
free
don
t
have
one
law
for
men
and
another
for
women
you
are
unjust
to
women
in
england
and
till
you
count
what
is
a
shame
in
a
woman
to
be
an
infamy
in
a
man
you
will
always
be
unjust
and
right
that
pillar
of
fire
and
wrong
that
pillar
of
cloud
will
be
made
dim
to
your
eyes
or
be
not
seen
at
all
or
if
seen
not
regarded
lady
caroline
might
i
dear
miss
worsley
as
you
are
standing
up
ask
you
for
my
cotton
that
is
just
behind
you
thank
you
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
arbuthnot
i
am
so
pleased
you
have
come
up
but
i
didn
t
hear
you
announced
allonby
oh
i
came
straight
in
from
the
terrace
lady
hunstanton
just
as
i
was
you
didn
t
tell
me
you
had
a
party
lady
hunstanton
not
a
party
only
a
few
guests
who
are
staying
in
the
house
and
whom
you
must
know
allow
me
to
help
caroline
this
is
arbuthnot
one
of
my
sweetest
friends
lady
caroline
pontefract
lady
stutfield
allonby
and
my
young
american
friend
miss
worsley
who
has
just
been
telling
us
all
how
wicked
we
are
hester
i
am
afraid
you
think
i
spoke
too
strongly
lady
hunstanton
but
there
are
some
things
in
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
young
lady
there
was
a
great
deal
of
truth
i
dare
say
in
what
you
said
and
you
looked
very
pretty
while
you
said
it
which
is
much
more
important
lord
illingworth
would
tell
us
the
only
point
where
i
thought
you
were
a
little
hard
was
about
lady
caroline
s
brother
about
poor
lord
henry
he
is
really
such
good
company
take
arbuthnot
s
things
footman
with
hester
lady
caroline
i
had
no
idea
it
was
your
brother
i
am
sorry
for
the
pain
i
must
have
caused
lady
caroline
my
dear
miss
worsley
the
only
part
of
your
little
speech
if
i
may
so
term
it
with
which
i
thoroughly
agreed
was
the
part
about
my
brother
nothing
that
you
could
possibly
say
could
be
too
bad
for
him
i
regard
henry
as
infamous
absolutely
infamous
but
i
am
bound
to
state
as
you
were
remarking
jane
that
he
is
excellent
company
and
he
has
one
of
the
best
cooks
in
london
and
after
a
good
dinner
one
can
forgive
anybody
even
one
s
own
relations
lady
hunstanton
miss
worsley
now
do
come
dear
and
make
friends
with
arbuthnot
she
is
one
of
the
good
sweet
simple
people
you
told
us
we
never
admitted
into
society
i
am
sorry
to
say
arbuthnot
comes
very
rarely
to
me
but
that
is
not
my
fault
allonby
what
a
bore
it
is
the
men
staying
so
long
after
dinner
i
expect
they
are
saying
the
most
dreadful
things
about
us
lady
stutfield
do
you
really
think
so
allonby
i
was
sure
of
it
lady
stutfield
how
very
very
horrid
of
them
shall
we
go
onto
the
terrace
allonby
oh
anything
to
get
away
from
the
dowagers
and
the
dowdies
and
goes
lady
stutfield
we
are
only
going
to
look
at
the
stars
lady
hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
you
will
find
a
great
many
dear
a
great
many
but
don
t
catch
cold
mrs
arbuthnot
we
shall
all
miss
gerald
so
much
dear
arbuthnot
arbuthnot
but
has
lord
illingworth
really
offered
to
make
gerald
his
secretary
lady
hunstanton
oh
yes
he
has
been
most
charming
about
it
he
has
the
highest
possible
opinion
of
your
boy
you
don
t
know
lord
illingworth
i
believe
dear
arbuthnot
i
have
never
met
him
lady
hunstanton
you
know
him
by
name
no
doubt
arbuthnot
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
i
live
so
much
out
of
the
world
and
see
so
few
people
i
remember
hearing
years
ago
of
an
old
lord
illingworth
who
lived
in
yorkshire
i
think
lady
hunstanton
ah
yes
that
would
be
the
last
earl
but
one
he
was
a
very
curious
man
he
wanted
to
marry
beneath
him
or
wouldn
t
i
believe
there
was
some
scandal
about
it
the
present
lord
illingworth
is
quite
different
he
is
very
distinguished
he
he
does
nothing
which
i
am
afraid
our
pretty
american
visitor
here
thinks
very
wrong
of
anybody
and
i
don
t
know
that
he
cares
much
for
the
subjects
in
which
you
are
so
interested
dear
arbuthnot
do
you
think
caroline
that
lord
illingworth
is
interested
in
the
housing
of
the
poor
lady
caroline
i
should
fancy
not
at
all
jane
lady
hunstanton
we
all
have
our
different
tastes
have
we
not
but
lord
illingworth
has
a
very
high
position
and
there
is
nothing
he
couldn
t
get
if
he
chose
to
ask
for
it
of
course
he
is
comparatively
a
young
man
still
and
he
has
only
come
to
his
title
long
exactly
is
it
caroline
since
lord
illingworth
succeeded
lady
caroline
about
four
years
i
think
jane
i
know
it
was
the
same
year
in
which
my
brother
had
his
last
exposure
in
the
evening
newspapers
lady
hunstanton
ah
i
remember
that
would
be
about
four
years
ago
of
course
there
were
a
great
many
people
between
the
present
lord
illingworth
and
the
title
arbuthnot
there
was
there
caroline
lady
caroline
there
was
poor
margaret
s
baby
you
remember
how
anxious
she
was
to
have
a
boy
and
it
was
a
boy
but
it
died
and
her
husband
died
shortly
afterwards
and
she
married
almost
immediately
one
of
lord
ascot
s
sons
who
i
am
told
beats
her
lady
hunstanton
ah
that
is
in
the
family
dear
that
is
in
the
family
and
there
was
also
i
remember
a
clergyman
who
wanted
to
be
a
lunatic
or
a
lunatic
who
wanted
to
be
a
clergyman
i
forget
which
but
i
know
the
court
of
chancery
investigated
the
matter
and
decided
that
he
was
quite
sane
and
i
saw
him
afterwards
at
poor
lord
plumstead
s
with
straws
in
his
hair
or
something
very
odd
about
him
i
can
t
recall
what
i
often
regret
lady
caroline
that
dear
lady
cecilia
never
lived
to
see
her
son
get
the
title
arbuthnot
lady
cecilia
lady
hunstanton
lord
illingworth
s
mother
dear
arbuthnot
was
one
of
the
duchess
of
jerningham
s
pretty
daughters
and
she
married
sir
thomas
harford
who
wasn
t
considered
a
very
good
match
for
her
at
the
time
though
he
was
said
to
be
the
handsomest
man
in
london
i
knew
them
all
quite
intimately
and
both
the
sons
arthur
and
george
arbuthnot
it
was
the
eldest
son
who
succeeded
of
course
lady
hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
no
dear
he
was
killed
in
the
hunting
field
or
was
it
fishing
caroline
i
forget
but
george
came
in
for
everything
i
always
tell
him
that
no
younger
son
has
ever
had
such
good
luck
as
he
has
had
arbuthnot
lady
hunstanton
i
want
to
speak
to
gerald
at
once
might
i
see
him
can
he
be
sent
for
lady
hunstanton
certainly
dear
i
will
send
one
of
the
servants
into
the
to
fetch
him
i
don
t
know
what
keeps
the
gentlemen
so
long
when
i
knew
lord
illingworth
first
as
plain
george
harford
he
was
simply
a
very
brilliant
young
man
about
town
with
not
a
penny
of
money
except
what
poor
dear
lady
cecilia
gave
him
she
was
quite
devoted
to
him
chiefly
i
fancy
because
he
was
on
bad
terms
with
his
father
oh
here
is
the
dear
archdeacon
it
doesn
t
matter
sir
john
doctor
daubeny
sir
john
over
lady
stutfield
doctor
daubeny
lady
hunstanton
the
archdeacon
lord
illingworth
has
been
most
entertaining
i
have
never
enjoyed
myself
more
mrs
arbuthnot
ah
arbuthnot
lady
hunstanton
doctor
baubeny
you
see
i
have
got
arbuthnot
to
come
to
me
at
last
the
archdeacon
that
is
a
great
honour
lady
hunstanton
daubeny
will
be
quite
jealous
of
you
lady
hunstanton
ah
i
am
so
sorry
daubeny
could
not
come
with
you
headache
as
usual
i
suppose

archdeacon

lady
hunstanton
a
perfect
martyr
but
she
is
happiest
alone
she
is
happiest
alone
lady
caroline
her
john
sir
john
over
to
his
doctor
baubeny
lady
hunstanton
mrs
arbuthnot
arbuthnot
watches
lord
illingworth
the
whole
time
he
has
passed
across
the
room
without
noticing
her
and
approaches
allonby
who
with
lady
stutfield
is
standing
by
the
door
looking
on
to
the
terrace
lord
illingworth
how

most
charming

in
the
world
allonby
taking
lady
stutfield

illingworth

what
a
short
time

as

whole
time

of
thing
there
is
nothing
lord
illingworth
doesn
t
know
lord
illingworth
my
dear

i
have
ever
met
i
feel
an
awful
duffer
when
i
am
with
you
lord
illingworth
of
course
i
have
had
so
few
advantages
i
have
not
been
to
eton
or
oxford
like
other
chaps
but
lord
illingworth
doesn
t
seem
to
mind
that
he
has
been
awfully
good
to
me
mother
arbuthnot
lord
illingworth
may
change
his
mind
he
may
not
really
want
you
as
his
secretary
gerald
mother
arbuthnot
you
must
remember
as
you
said
yourself
you
have
had
so
few
advantages
allonby
lord
illingworth
i
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
do

more

settled
isn
t
it
gerald
i
hope
so
lord
illingworth
across
mrs
arbuthnot
allonby
i
thought
you
were
never
going
to
leave
the
lady
in
black
velvet
lord
illingworth
she
is
excessively
handsome
mrs
arbuthnot
lady
hunstanton
caroline
shall
we
all
make
a
move
to
the
miss
worsley
is
going
to
play
you
ll
come
too
dear
arbuthnot
won
t
you
you
don
t
know
what
a
treat
is
in
store
for
you
doctor
baubeny
i
must
really
take
miss
worsley
down
some
afternoon
to
the
rectory
i
should
so
much
like
dear
daubeny
to
hear
her
on
the
violin
ah
i
forgot
dear
daubeny
s
hearing
is
a
little
defective
is
it
not
the
archdeacon
her
deafness
is
a
great
privation
to
her
she
can
t
even
hear
my
sermons
now
she
reads
them
at
home
but
she
has
many
resources
in
herself
many
resources
lady
hunstanton
she
reads
a
good
deal
i
suppose
the
archdeacon
just
the
very
largest
print
the
eyesight
is
rapidly
going
but
she
s
never
morbid
never
morbid
gerald
lord
illingworth
do
speak
to
my
mother
lord
illingworth
before
you
go
into
the
she
seems
to
think
somehow
you
don
t
mean
what
you
said
to
me
allonby
aren
t
you
coming
lord
illingworth
in
a
few
moments
lady
hunstanton
if
arbuthnot
would
allow
me
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
and
we
will
join
you
later
on
lady
hunstanton
ah
of
course
you
will
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
and
she
will
have
a
great
deal
to
thank
you
for
it
is
not
every
son
who
gets
such
an
offer
arbuthnot
but
i
know
you
appreciate
that
dear
lady
caroline
john
lady
hunstanton
now
don
t
keep
arbuthnot
too
long
lord
illingworth
we
can
t
spare
her
following
the
other
of
violin
heard
from
lord
illingworth
so
that
is
our
son
rachel
well
i
am
very
proud
of
him
he
in
a
harford
every
inch
of
him
by
the
way
why
arbuthnot
rachel
arbuthnot
one
name
is
as
good
as
another
when
one
has
no
right
to
any
name
lord
illingworth
i
suppose
why
gerald
arbuthnot
after
a
man
whose
heart
i
my
father
lord
illingworth
well
rachel
what
in
over
is
over
all
i
have
got
to
say
now
in
that
i
am
very
very
much
pleased
with
our
boy
the
world
will
know
him
merely
as
my
private
secretary
but
to
me
he
will
be
something
very
near
and
very
dear
it
is
a
curious
thing
rachel
my
life
seemed
to
be
quite
complete
it
was
not
so
it
lacked
something
it
lacked
a
son
i
have
found
my
son
now
i
am
glad
i
have
found
him
arbuthnot
you
have
no
right
to
claim
him
or
the
smallest
part
of
him
the
boy
is
entirely
mine
and
shall
remain
mine
lord
illingworth
my
dear
rachel
you
have
had
him
to
yourself
for
over
twenty
years
why
not
let
me
have
him
for
a
little
now
he
is
quite
as
much
mine
as
yours
arbuthnot
are
you
talking
of
the
child
you
abandoned
of
the
child
who
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
might
have
died
of
hunger
and
of
want
lord
illingworth
you
forget
rachel
it
was
you
who
left
me
it
was
not
i
who
left
you
arbuthnot
i
left
you
because
you
refused
to
give
the
child
a
name
before
my
son
was
born
i
implored
you
to
marry
me
lord
illingworth
i
had
no
expectations
then
and
besides
rachel
i
wasn
t
much
older
than
you
were
i
was
only
i
was
i
believe
when
the
whole
thing
began
in
your
father
s
garden
arbuthnot
when
a
man
is
old
enough
to
do
wrong
he
should
be
old
enough
to
do
right
also
lord
illingworth
my
dear
rachel
intellectual
generalities
are
always
interesting
but
generalities
in
morals
mean
absolutely
nothing
as
for
saying
i
left
our
child
to
starve
that
of
course
is
untrue
and
silly
my
mother
offered
you
six
hundred
a
year
but
you
wouldn
t
take
anything
you
simply
disappeared
and
carried
the
child
away
with
you
arbuthnot
i
wouldn
t
have
accepted
a
penny
from
her
your
father
was
different
he
told
you
in
my
presence
when
we
were
in
paris
that
it
was
your
duty
to
marry
me
lord
illingworth
oh
duty
is
what
one
expects
from
others
it
is
not
what
one
does
oneself
of
course
i
was
influenced
by
my
mother
every
man
is
when
he
is
young
arbuthnot
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
gerald
shall
certainly
not
go
away
with
you
lord
illingworth
what
nonsense
rachel
arbuthnot
do
you
think
i
would
allow
my
lord
illingworth
son
arbuthnot
my
son
lord
illingworth
his
go
away
with
the
man
who
spoiled
my
youth
who
ruined
my
life
who
has
tainted
every
moment
of
my
days
you
don
t
realise
what
my
past
has
been
in
suffering
and
in
shame
lord
illingworth
my
dear
rachel
i
must
candidly
say
that
i
think
gerald
s
future
considerably
more
important
than
your
past
arbuthnot
gerald
can
not
separate
his
future
from
my
past
lord
illingworth
that
is
exactly
what
he
should
do
that
is
exactly
what
you
should
help
him
to
do
what
a
typical
woman
you
are
you
talk
sentimentally
and
you
are
thoroughly
selfish
the
whole
time
but
don
t
let
us
have
a
scene
rachel
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
matter
from
the
point
of
view
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
is
best
for
our
son
leaving
you
and
me
out
of
the
question
what
is
our
son
at
present
an
underpaid
clerk
in
a
small
provincial
bank
in
a
english
town
if
you
imagine
he
is
quite
happy
in
such
a
position
you
are
mistaken
he
is
thoroughly
discontented
arbuthnot
he
was
not
discontented
till
he
met
you
you
have
made
him
so
lord
illingworth
of
course
i
made
him
so
discontent
is
the
first
step
in
the
progress
of
a
man
or
a
nation
but
i
did
not
leave
him
with
a
mere
longing
for
things
he
could
not
get
no
i
made
him
a
charming
offer
he
jumped
at
it
i
need
hardly
say
any
young
man
would
and
now
simply
because
it
turns
out
that
i
am
the
boy
s
own
father
and
he
my
own
son
you
propose
practically
to
ruin
his
career
that
is
to
say
if
i
were
a
perfect
stranger
you
would
allow
gerald
to
go
away
with
me
but
as
he
is
my
own
flesh
and
blood
you
won
t
how
utterly
illogical
you
are
arbuthnot
i
will
not
allow
him
to
go
lord
illingworth
how
can
you
prevent
it
what
excuse
can
you
give
to
him
for
making
him
decline
such
an
offer
as
mine
i
won
t
tell
him
in
what
relations
i
stand
to
him
i
need
hardly
say
but
you
daren
t
tell
him
you
know
that
look
how
you
have
brought
him
up
arbuthnot
i
have
brought
him
up
to
be
a
good
man
lord
illingworth
quite
so
and
what
is
the
result
you
have
educated
him
to
be
your
judge
if
he
ever
finds
you
out
and
a
bitter
an
unjust
judge
he
will
be
to
you
don
t
be
deceived
rachel
children
begin
by
loving
their
parents
after
a
time
they
judge
them
rarely
if
ever
do
they
forgive
them
arbuthnot
george
don
t
take
my
son
away
from
me
i
have
had
twenty
years
of
sorrow
and
i
have
only
had
one
thing
to
love
me
only
one
thing
to
love
you
have
had
a
life
of
joy
and
pleasure
and
success
you
have
been
quite
happy
you
have
never
thought
of
us
there
was
no
reason
according
to
your
views
of
life
why
you
should
have
remembered
us
at
all
your
meeting
us
was
a
mere
accident
a
horrible
accident
forget
it
don
t
come
now
and
rob
me
of
of
all
i
have
in
the
whole
world
you
are
so
rich
in
other
things
leave
me
the
little
vineyard
of
my
life
leave
me
the
garden
and
the
well
of
water
the
god
sent
me
in
pity
or
in
wrath
oh
leave
me
that
george
don
t
take
gerald
from
me
lord
illingworth
rachel
at
the
present
moment
you
are
not
necessary
to
gerald
s
career
i
am
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
subject
arbuthnot
i
will
not
let
him
go
lord
illingworth
here
is
gerald
he
has
a
right
to
decide
for
himself
gerald
gerald
well
dear
mother
i
hope
you
have
settled
it
all
with
lord
illingworth
arbuthnot
i
have
not
gerald
lord
illingworth
your
mother
seems
not
to
like
your
coming
with
me
for
some
reason
gerald
why
mother
arbuthnot
i
thought
you
were
quite
happy
here
with
me
gerald
i
didn
t
know
you
were
so
anxious
to
leave
me
gerald
mother
how
can
you
talk
like
that
of
course
i
have
been
quite
happy
with
you
but
a
man
can
t
stay
always
with
his
mother
no
chap
does
i
want
to
make
myself
a
position
to
do
something
i
thought
you
would
have
been
proud
to
see
me
lord
illingworth
s
secretary
arbuthnot
i
do
not
think
you
would
be
suitable
as
a
private
secretary
to
lord
illingworth
you
have
no
qualifications
lord
illingworth
i
don
t
wish
to
seem
to
interfere
for
a
moment
arbuthnot
but
as
far
as
your
last
objection
is
concerned
i
surely
am
the
best
judge
and
i
can
only
tell
you
that
your
son
has
all
the
qualifications
i
had
hoped
for
he
has
more
in
fact
than
i
had
even
thought
of
far
more
arbuthnot
have
you
any
other
reason
arbuthnot
why
you
don
t
wish
your
son
to
accept
this
post
gerald
have
you
mother
do
answer
lord
illingworth
if
you
have
arbuthnot
pray
pray
say
it
we
are
quite
by
ourselves
here
whatever
it
is
i
need
not
say
i
will
not
repeat
it
gerald
mother
lord
illingworth
if
you
would
like
to
be
alone
with
your
son
i
will
leave
you
you
may
have
some
other
reason
you
don
t
wish
me
to
hear
arbuthnot
i
have
no
other
reason
lord
illingworth
then
my
dear
boy
we
may
look
on
the
thing
as
settled
come
you
and
i
will
smoke
a
cigarette
on
the
terrace
together
and
arbuthnot
pray
let
me
tell
you
that
i
think
you
have
acted
very
very
wisely
gerald
arbuthnot
left
stands
immobile
with
a
look
of
unutterable
sorrow

gerald
lord
illingworth
on
a
gerald
a
lord
illingworth
thoroughly
sensible
woman
your
mother
gerald
i
knew
she
would
come
round
in
the
end
gerald
my
mother
is
awfully
conscientious
lord
illingworth
and
i
know
she
doesn
t
think
i
am
educated
enough
to
be
your
secretary
she
is
perfectly
right
too
i
was
fearfully
idle
when
i
was
at
school
and
i
couldn
t
pass
an
examination
now
to
save
my
life
lord
illingworth
my
dear
gerald
examinations
are
of
no
value
whatsoever
if
a
man
is
a
gentleman
he
knows
quite
enough
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman
whatever
he
knows
is
bad
for
him
gerald
but
i
am
so
ignorant
of
the
world
lord
illingworth
lord
illingworth
don
t
be
afraid
gerald
remember
that
you
ve
got
on
your
side
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
there
is
nothing
like
youth
the
are
mortgaged
to
life
the
old
are
in
life
s
but
youth
is
the
lord
of
life
youth
has
a
kingdom
waiting
for
it
every
one
is
born
a
king
and
most
people
die
in
exile
like
most
kings
to
win
back
my
youth
gerald
there
is
nothing
i
wouldn
t
take
exercise
get
up
early
or
be
a
useful
member
of
the
community
gerald
but
you
don
t
call
yourself
old
lord
illingworth
lord
illingworth
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
gerald
gerald
i
don
t
remember
my
father
he
died
years
ago
lord
illingworth
so
lady
hunstanton
told
me
gerald
it
is
very
curious
my
mother
never
talks
to
me
about
my
father
i
sometimes
think
she
must
have
married
beneath
her
lord
illingworth
really
over
and
puts
his
hand
gerald
s
you
have
missed
not
having
a
father
i
suppose
gerald
gerald
oh
no
my
mother
has
been
so
good
to
me
no
one
ever
had
such
a
mother
as
i
have
had
lord
illingworth
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
still
i
should
imagine
that
most
mothers
don
t
quite
understand
their
sons
don
t
realise
i
mean
that
a
son
has
ambitions
a
desire
to
see
life
to
make
himself
a
name
after
all
gerald
you
couldn
t
be
expected
to
pass
all
your
life
in
such
a
hole
as
wrockley
could
you
gerald
oh
no
it
would
be
dreadful
lord
illingworth
a
mother
s
love
is
very
touching
of
course
but
it
is
often
curiously
selfish
i
mean
there
is
a
good
deal
of
selfishness
in
it
gerald
i
suppose
there
is
lord
illingworth
your
mother
is
a
thoroughly
good
woman
but
good
women
have
such
limited
views
of
life
their
horizon
is
so
small
their
interests
are
so
petty
aren
t
they
gerald
they
are
awfully
interested
certainly
in
things
we
don
t
care
much
about
lord
illingworth
i
suppose
your
mother
is
very
religious
and
that
sort
of
thing
gerald
oh
yes
she
s
always
going
to
church
lord
illingworth
ah
she
is
not
modern
and
to
be
modern
is
the
only
thing
worth
being
nowadays
you
want
to
be
modern
don
t
you
gerald
you
want
to
know
life
as
it
really
is
not
to
be
put
of
with
any
theories
about
life
well
what
you
have
to
do
at
present
is
simply
to
fit
yourself
for
the
best
society
a
man
who
can
dominate
a
london
can
dominate
the
world
the
future
belongs
to
the
dandy
it
is
the
exquisites
who
are
going
to
rule
gerald
i
should
like
to
wear
nice
things
awfully
but
i
have
always
been
told
that
a
man
should
not
think
too
much
about
his
clothes
lord
illingworth
people
nowadays
are
so
absolutely
superficial
that
they
don
t
understand
the
philosophy
of
the
superficial
by
the
way
gerald
you
should
learn
how
to
tie
your
tie
better
sentiment
is
all
very
well
for
the
but
the
essential
thing
for
a
necktie
is
style
a
tie
is
the
first
serious
step
in
life
gerald
i
might
be
able
to
learn
how
to
tie
a
tie
lord
illingworth
but
i
should
never
be
able
to
talk
as
you
do
i
don
t
know
how
to
talk
lord
illingworth
oh
talk
to
every
woman
as
if
you
loved
her
and
to
every
man
as
if
he
bored
you
and
at
the
end
of
your
first
season
you
will
have
the
reputation
of
possessing
the
most
perfect
social
tact
gerald
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
into
society
isn
t
it
lord
illingworth
to
get
into
the
best
society
nowadays
one
has
either
to
feed
people
amuse
people
or
shock
is
all
gerald
i
suppose
society
is
wonderfully
delightful
lord
illingworth
to
be
in
it
is
merely
a
bore
but
to
be
out
of
it
simply
a
tragedy
society
is
a
necessary
thing
no
man
has
any
real
success
in
this
world
unless
he
has
got
women
to
back
him
and
women
rule
society
if
you
have
not
got
women
on
your
side
you
are
quite
over
you
might
just
as
well
be
a
barrister
or
a
stockbroker
or
a
journalist
at
once
gerald
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
women
is
it
not
lord
illingworth
you
should
never
try
to
understand
them
women
are
pictures
men
are
problems
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
woman
really
by
the
way
is
always
a
dangerous
thing
to
at
her
don
t
listen
to
her
gerald
but
women
are
awfully
clever
aren
t
they
lord
illingworth
one
should
always
tell
them
so
but
to
the
philosopher
my
dear
gerald
women
represent
the
triumph
of
matter
over
as
men
represent
the
triumph
of
mind
over
morals
gerald
how
then
can
women
have
so
much
power
as
you
say
they
have
lord
illingworth
the
history
of
women
is
the
history
of
the
worst
form
of
tyranny
the
world
has
ever
known
the
tyranny
of
the
weak
over
the
strong
it
is
the
only
tyranny
that
lasts
gerald
but
haven
t
women
got
a
refining
influence
lord
illingworth
nothing
refines
but
the
intellect
gerald
still
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
women
aren
t
there
lord
illingworth
only
two
kinds
in
society
the
plain
and
the
coloured
gerald
but
there
are
good
women
in
society
aren
t
there
lord
illingworth
far
too
many
gerald
but
do
you
think
women
shouldn
t
be
good
lord
illingworth
one
should
never
tell
them
so
they
d
all
become
good
at
once
women
are
a
fascinatingly
wilful
sex
every
woman
is
a
rebel
and
usually
in
wild
revolt
against
herself
gerald
you
have
never
been
married
lord
illingworth
have
you
lord
illingworth
men
marry
because
they
are
tired
women
because
they
are
curious
both
are
disappointed
gerald
but
don
t
you
think
one
can
be
happy
when
one
is
married
lord
illingworth
perfectly
happy
but
the
happiness
of
a
married
man
my
dear
gerald
depends
on
the
people
he
has
not
married
gerald
but
if
one
is
in
love
lord
illingworth
one
should
always
be
in
love
that
is
the
reason
one
should
never
marry
gerald
love
is
a
very
wonderful
thing
isn
t
it
lord
illingworth
when
one
is
in
love
one
begins
by
deceiving
oneself
and
one
ends
by
deceiving
others
that
is
what
the
world
calls
a
romance
but
a
really
is
comparatively
rare
nowadays
it
is
the
privilege
of
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
that
is
the
one
use
of
the
idle
classes
in
a
country
and
the
only
possible
explanation
of
us
harfords
gerald
harfords
lord
illingworth
lord
illingworth
that
is
my
family
name
you
should
study
the
peerage
gerald
it
is
the
one
book
a
young
man
about
town
should
know
thoroughly
and
it
is
the
best
thing
in
fiction
the
english
have
ever
done
and
now
gerald
you
are
going
into
a
perfectly
new
life
with
me
and
i
want
you
to
know
how
to
live

giving
him
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
over
a
pleasant
cigarette

i
have
been
giving
him
the
best
of

lady
hunstanton
and
the
best
of
cigarettes
lady
hunstanton
i
am
so
sorry
i
was
not
here
to
listen
to
you
but
i
suppose
i
am
too
old
now
to
learn
except
from
you
dear
archdeacon
when
you
are
in
your
nice
pulpit
but
then
i
always
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
so
i
don
t
feel
alarmed
mrs
arbuthnot
ah
dear
arbuthnot
do
come
and
join
us
come
dear
mrs
arbuthnot
gerald
has
been
having
such
a
long
talk
with
lord
illingworth
i
am
sure
you
must
feel
very
much
flattered
at
the
pleasant
way
in
which
everything
has
turned
out
for
him
let
us
sit
down
sit
and
how
is
your
beautiful
embroidery
going
on
arbuthnot
i
am
always
at
work
lady
hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
daubeny
embroiders
a
little
too
doesn
t
she
the
archdeacon
she
was
very
deft
with
her
needle
once
quite
a
dorcas
but
the
gout
has
crippled
her
fingers
a
good
deal
she
has
not
touched
the
tambour
frame
for
nine
or
ten
years
but
she
has
many
other
amusements
she
is
very
much
interested
in
her
own
health
lady
hunstanton
ah
that
is
always
a
nice
distraction
in
it
not
now
what
are
you
talking
about
lord
illingworth
do
tell
us
lord
illingworth
i
was
on
the
point
of
explaining
to
gerald
that
the
world
has
always
laughed
at
its
own
tragedies
that
being
the
only
way
in
which
it
has
been
able
to
bear
them
and
that
consequently
whatever
the
world
has
treated
seriously
belongs
to
the
comedy
side
of
things
lady
hunstanton
now
i
am
quite
out
of
my
depth
i
usually
am
when
lord
illingworth
says
anything
and
the
humane
society
is
most
careless
they
never
rescue
me
i
am
left
to
sink
i
have
a
dim
idea
dear
lord
illingworth
that
you
are
always
on
the
side
of
the
sinners
and
i
know
i
always
try
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
saints
but
that
is
as
far
as
i
get
and
after
all
it
may
be
merely
the
fancy
of
a
drowning
person
lord
illingworth
the
only
difference
between
the
saint
and
the
sinner
is
that
every
saint
has
a
past
and
every
sinner
has
a
future
lady
hunstanton
ah
that
quite
does
for
me
i
haven
t
a
word
to
say
you
and
i
dear
arbuthnot
are
behind
the
age
we
can
t
follow
lord
illingworth
too
much
care
was
taken
with
our
education
i
am
afraid
to
have
been
well
brought
up
is
a
great
drawback
nowadays
it
shuts
one
out
from
so
much
arbuthnot
i
should
be
sorry
to
follow
lord
illingworth
in
any
of
his
opinions
lady
hunstanton
you
are
quite
right
dear
gerald
his
shoulders
and
looks
irritably
over
at
his
lady
caroline
lady
caroline
jane
have
you
seen
john
anywhere
lady
hunstanton
you
needn
t
be
anxious
about
him
dear
he
is
with
lady
stutfield
i
saw
them
some
time
ago
in
the
yellow
they
seem
quite
happy
together
you
are
not
going
caroline
pray
sit
down
lady
caroline
i
think
i
had
better
look
after
john
lady
caroline
lady
hunstanton
it
doesn
t
do
to
pay
men
so
much
attention
and
caroline
has
really
nothing
to
be
anxious
about
lady
stutfield
is
very
sympathetic
she
is
just
as
sympathetic
about
one
thing
as
she
is
about
another
a
beautiful
nature
sir
john
mrs
allonby
ah
here
is
sir
john
and
with
allonby
too
i
suppose
it
was
allonby
i
saw
him
with
sir
john
caroline
has
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
allonby
we
have
been
waiting
for
her
in
the
dear
lady
hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
ah
the
of
course
i
thought
it
was
the
yellow
my
memory
is
getting
so
defective
archdeacon
daubeny
has
a
wonderful
memory
hasn
t
she
the
archdeacon
she
used
to
be
quite
remarkable
for
her
memory
but
since
her
last
attack
she
recalls
chiefly
the
events
of
her
early
childhood
but
she
finds
great
pleasure
in
such
retrospections
great
pleasure
lady
stutfield
mr
kelvil
lady
hunstanton
ah
dear
lady
stutfield
and
what
has
kelvil
been
talking
to
you
about
lady
stutfield
about
bimetallism
as
well
as
i
remember
lady
hunstanton
bimetallism
is
that
quite
a
nice
subject
however
i
know
people
discuss
everything
very
freely
nowadays
what
did
sir
john
talk
to
you
about
dear
allonby
allonby
about
patagonia
lady
hunstanton
really
what
a
remote
topic
but
very
improving
i
have
no
doubt
allonby
he
has
been
most
interesting
on
the
subject
of
patagonia
savages
seem
to
have
quite
the
same
views
as
cultured
people
on
almost
all
subjects
they
are
excessively
advanced
lady
hunstanton
what
do
they
do
allonby
apparently
everything
lady
hunstanton
well
it
is
very
gratifying
dear
archdeacon
is
it
not
to
find
that
human
nature
is
permanently
the
whole
the
world
is
the
same
world
is
it
not
lord
illingworth
the
world
is
simply
divided
into
two
who
believe
the
incredible
like
the
those
who
do
the
allonby
like
yourself
lord
illingworth
yes
i
am
always
astonishing
myself
it
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
life
worth
living
lady
stutfield
and
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
that
astonishes
you
lord
illingworth
i
have
been
discovering
all
kinds
of
beautiful
qualities
in
my
own
nature
allonby
ah
don
t
become
quite
perfect
all
at
once
do
it
gradually
lord
illingworth
i
don
t
intend
to
grow
perfect
at
all
at
least
i
hope
i
shan
t
it
would
be
most
inconvenient
women
love
us
for
our
defects
if
we
have
enough
of
them
they
will
forgive
us
everything
even
our
gigantic
intellects
allonby
it
is
premature
to
ask
us
to
forgive
analysis
we
forgive
adoration
that
is
quite
as
much
as
should
be
expected
from
us
lord
alfred
lady
stutfield
lady
hunstanton
ah
we
women
should
forgive
everything
shouldn
t
we
dear
arbuthnot
i
am
sure
you
agree
with
me
in
that
arbuthnot
i
do
not
lady
hunstanton
i
think
there
are
many
things
women
should
never
forgive
lady
hunstanton
what
sort
of
things
arbuthnot
the
ruin
of
another
woman
s
life
slowly
away
to
back
of
lady
hunstanton
ah
those
things
are
very
sad
no
doubt
but
i
believe
there
are
admirable
homes
where
people
of
that
kind
are
looked
after
and
reformed
and
i
think
on
the
whole
that
the
secret
of
life
is
to
take
things
very
very
easily
allonby
the
secret
of
life
is
never
to
have
an
emotion
that
is
unbecoming
lady
stutfield
the
secret
of
life
is
to
appreciate
the
pleasure
of
being
terribly
terribly
deceived
kelvil
the
secret
of
life
is
to
resist
temptation
lady
stutfield
lord
illingworth
there
is
no
secret
of
life
life
s
aim
if
it
has
one
is
simply
to
be
always
looking
for
temptations
there
are
not
nearly
enough
i
sometimes
pass
a
whole
day
without
coming
across
a
single
one
it
is
quite
dreadful
it
makes
one
so
nervous
about
the
future
lady
hunstanton
her
fan
at
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
dear
lord
illingworth
but
everything
you
have
said
seems
to
me
excessively
immoral
it
has
been
most
interesting
listening
to
you
lord
illingworth
all
thought
is
immoral
its
very
essence
is
destruction
if
you
think
of
anything
you
kill
it
nothing
survives
being
thought
of
lady
hunstanton
i
don
t
understand
a
word
lord
illingworth
but
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
all
quite
true
personally
i
have
very
little
to
reproach
myself
with
on
the
score
of
thinking
i
don
t
believe
in
women
thinking
too
much
women
should
think
in
moderation
as
they
should
do
all
things
in
moderation
lord
illingworth
moderation
is
a
fatal
thing
lady
hunstanton
nothing
succeeds
like
excess
lady
hunstanton
i
hope
i
shall
remember
that
it
sounds
an
admirable
maxim
but
i
m
beginning
to
forget
everything
it
s
a
great
misfortune
lord
illingworth
it
is
one
of
your
most
fascinating
qualities
lady
hunstanton
no
woman
should
have
a
memory
memory
in
a
woman
is
the
beginning
of
dowdiness
one
can
always
tell
from
a
woman
s
bonnet
whether
she
has
got
a
memory
or
not
lady
hunstanton
how
charming
you
are
dear
lord
illingworth
you
always
find
out
that
one
s
most
glaring
fault
is
one
s
most
important
virtue
you
have
the
most
comforting
views
of
life

evening
somehow
you
brought
with
you
a
sense
of
what
is
good
and
pure
in
life
i
had
been
foolish
there
are
things
that

may
be
said
at
the
wrong
time
and
to
the
wrong
people

be
allowed

come
into
the
society
of
good

and
the
man

be
punished
in

way

happy
arbuthnot
at

like
that
mother
of
course
i
am
sorry
to
leave
you
why
you
are
the
best
mother
in
the
whole
world
but
after
all
as
lord
illingworth
says
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
such
a
place
as
wrockley
you
don
t
mind
it
but
i
m
ambitions
i
want
something
more
than
that
i
want
to
have
a
career
i
want
to
do
something
that
will
make
you
proud
of
me
and
lord
illingworth
is
going
to
help
me
he
is
going
to
do
everything
for
me
arbuthnot
gerald
don
t
go
away
with
lord
illingworth
i
implore
you
not
to
gerald
i
beg
you
gerald
mother
how
changeable
you
are
you
don
t
seem
to
know
your
own
mind
for
a
single
moment
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
in
the
you
agreed
to
the
whole
thing
now
you
turn
round
and
make
objections
and
try
to
force
me
to
give
up
my
one
chance
in
life
yes
my
one
chance
you
don
t
suppose
that
men
like
lord
illingworth
are
to
be
found
every
day
do
you
mother
it
is
very
strange
that
when
i
have
had
such
a
wonderful
piece
of
good
luck
the
one
person
to
put
difficulties
in
my
way
should
be
my
own
mother
besides
you
know
mother
i
love
hester
worsley
who
could
help
loving
her
i
love
her
more
than
i
have
ever
told
you
far
more
and
if
i
had
a
position
if
i
had
prospects
i
could
ask
her
t
you
understand
now
mother
what
it
means
to
me
to
be
lord
illingworth
s
secretary
to
start
like
that
is
to
find
a
career
ready
for
for
one
if
i
were
lord
illingworth
s
secretary
i
could
ask
hester
to
be
my
wife
as
a
wretched
bank
clerk
with
a
hundred
a
year
it
would
be
an
impertinence
arbuthnot
i
fear
you
need
have
no
hopes
of
miss
worsley
i
know
her
views
on
life
she
has
just
told
them
to
me
gerald
then
i
have
my
ambition
left
at
any
rate
that
is
am
glad
i
have
that
you
have
always
tried
to
crush
my
ambition
t
you
you
have
told
me
that
the
world
is
a
wicked
place
that
success
is
not
worth
having
that
society
is
shallow
and
all
that
sort
of
i
don
t
believe
it
mother
i
think
the
world
must
be
delightful
i
think
society
must
be
exquisite
i
think
success
is
a
thing
worth
having
you
have
been
wrong
in
all
that
you
taught
me
mother
quite
wrong
lord
illingworth
is
a
successful
man
he
is
a
fashionable
man
he
is
a
man
who
lives
in
the
world
and
for
it
well
i
would
give
anything
to
be
just
like
lord
illingworth
arbuthnot
i
would
sooner
see
you
dead
gerald
mother
what
is
your
objection
to
lord
illingworth
tell
me
right
out
what
is
it
arbuthnot
he
is
a
bad
man
gerald
in
what
way
bad
i
don
t
understand
what
you
mean
arbuthnot
i
will
tell
you
gerald
i
suppose
you
think
him
bad
because
he
doesn
t
believe
the
same
things
as
you
do
well
men
are
different
from
women
mother
it
is
natural
that
they
should
have
different
views
arbuthnot
it
is
not
what
lord
illingworth
believes
or
what
he
does
not
believe
that
makes
him
bad
it
is
what
he
is
gerald
mother
is
it
something
you
know
of
him
something
you
actually
know
arbuthnot
it
is
something
i
know
gerald
something
you
are
quite
sure
of
arbuthnot
quite
sure
of
gerald
how
long
have
you
known
it
arbuthnot
for
twenty
years
gerald
is
it
fair
to
go
back
twenty
years
in
any
man
s
career
and
what
have
you
or
i
to
do
with
lord
illingworth
s
early
life
what
business
is
it
of
ours
arbuthnot
what
this
man
has
been
he
is
now
and
will
be
always
gerald
mother
tell
me
what
lord
illingworth
did
if
he
did
anything
shameful
i
will
not
go
away
with
him
surely
you
know
me
well
enough
for
that
arbuthnot
gerald
come
near
to
me
quite
close
to
me
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
little
boy
when
you
were
mother
s
own
boy
gerald
down
betide
his
runs
her
fingers
through
his
strokes
his
gerald
there
was
a
girl
once
she
was
very
young
she
was
little
over
eighteen
at
the
time
george
was
lord
illingworth
s
name
harford
met
her
she
knew
nothing
about
life
everything
he
made
this
girl
love
him
he
made
her
love
him
so
much
that
she
left
her
father
s
house
with
him
one
morning
she
loved
him
so
much
and
he
had
promised
to
marry
her
he
had
solemnly
promised
to
marry
her
and
she
had
believed
him
she
was
very
young
ignorant
of
what
life
really
is
but
he
put
the
marriage
off
from
week
to
week
and
month
to
trusted
in
him
all
the
while
she
loved
her
child
was
she
had
a
implored
him
for
the
child
s
sake
to
marry
her
that
the
child
might
have
a
name
that
her
sin
might
not
be
visited
on
the
child
who
was
innocent
he
refused
after
the
child
was
born
she
left
him
taking
the
child
away
and
her
life
was
ruined
and
her
soul
ruined
and
all
that
was
sweet
and
good
and
pure
in
her
ruined
also
she
suffered
suffers
now
she
will
always
suffer
for
her
there
is
no
joy
no
peace
no
atonement
she
is
a
woman
who
drags
a
chain
like
a
guilty
thing
she
is
a
woman
who
wears
a
mask
like
a
thing
that
is
a
leper
the
fire
can
not
purify
her
the
waters
can
not
quench
her
anguish
nothing
can
heal
her
no
anodyne
can
give
her
sleep
no
poppies
forgetfulness
she
is
lost
she
is
a
lost
soul
is
why
i
call
lord
illingworth
a
bad
man
that
is
why
i
don
t
want
my
boy
to
be
with
him
gerald
my
dear
mother
it
all
sounds
very
tragic
of
course
but
i
dare
say
the
girl
was
just
as
much
to
blame
as
lord
illingworth
all
would
a
really
nice
girl
a
girl
with
any
nice
feelings
at
all
go
away
from
her
home
with
a
man
to
whom
she
was
not
married
and
live
with
him
as
his
wife
no
nice
girl
would
arbuthnot
a
gerald
i
withdraw
all
my
objections
you
are
at
liberty
to
go
away
with
lord
illingworth
when
and
where
you
choose
gerald
dear
mother
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
stand

my
way

are
the
best
woman

anything

allonby
lady
hunstanton
good
morning
gerald
gerald
good
morning
lady
hunstanton
good
morning
allonby
lady
hunstanton
we
came
to
inquire
for
your
dear
mother
gerald
i
hope
she
is
better
gerald
my
mother
has
not
come
down
yet
lady
hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
ah
i
am
afraid
the
heat
was
too
much
for
her
last
night
i
think
there
must
have
been
thunder
in
the
air
or
perhaps
it
was
the
music
music
makes
one
feel
so
least
it
always
gets
on
one
s
nerves
allonby
it
s
the
same
thing
nowadays
lady
hunstanton
i
am
so
glad
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
dear
i
am
afraid
you
mean
something
wrong
ah
i
see
you
re
examining
arbuthnot
s
pretty
room
isn
t
it
nice
and
allonby
the
room
through
her
it
looks
quite
the
happy
english
home
lady
hunstanton
that
s
just
the
word
dear
that
just
describes
it
one
feels
your
mother
s
good
influence
in
everything
she
has
about
her
gerald
allonby
lord
illingworth
says
that
all
influence
is
bad
but
that
a
good
influence
is
the
worst
in
the
world
lady
hunstanton
when
lord
illingworth
knows
arbuthnot
better
he
will
change
his
mind
i
must
certainly
bring
him
here
allonby
i
should
like
to
see
lord
illingworth
in
a
happy
english
home
lady
hunstanton
it
would
do
him
a
great
deal
of
good
dear
most
women
in
london
nowadays
seem
to
furnish
their
rooms
with
nothing
but
orchids
foreigners
and
french
novels
but
here
we
have
the
room
of
a
sweet
saint
fresh
natural
flowers
books
that
don
t
shock
one
pictures
that
one
can
look
at
without
blushing
allonby
but
i
like
blushing
lady
hunstanton
well
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
blushing
if
one
can
do
it
at
the
proper
moment
poor
dear
hunstanton
used
to
tell
me
i
didn
t
blush
nearly
often
enough
but
then
he
was
so
very
particular
he
wouldn
t
let
me
know
any
of
his
men
friends
except
those
who
were
over
seventy
like
poor
lord
ashton
who
afterwards
by
the
way
was
brought
into
the
divorce
court
a
most
unfortunate
case
allonby
i
delight
in
men
over
seventy
they
always
offer
one
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
i
think
seventy
an
ideal
age
for
a
man
lady
hunstanton
she
is
quite
incorrigible
gerald
isn
t
she
gerald
i
hope
your
dear
mother
will
come
and
see
me
more
often
now
you
and
lord
illingworth
start
almost
immediately
don
t
you
gerald
i
have
given
up
my
intention
of
being
lord
illingworth
s
secretary
lady
hunstanton
surely
not
gerald
it
would
be
most
unwise
of
you
what
reason
can
you
have
gerald
i
don
t
think
i
should
be
suitable
for
the
post
allonby
i
wish
lord
illingworth
would
ask
me
to
be
his
secretary
but
he
says
i
am
not
serious
enough
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
you
really
mustn
t
talk
like
that
in
this
house
arbuthnot
doesn
t
know
anything
about
the
wicked
society
in
which
we
all
live
she
won
t
go
into
it
she
is
far
too
good
i
consider
it
was
a
great
honour
her
coming
to
me
last
night
it
gave
quite
an
atmosphere
of
respectability
to
the
party
allonby
ah
that
must
have
been
what
you
thought
was
thunder
in
the
air
lady
hunstanton
my
dear
how
can
you
say
that
there
is
no
resemblance
between
the
two
things
at
all
but
really
gerald
what
do
you
mean
by
not
being
suitable
gerald
lord
illingworth
s
views
of
life
and
mine
are
too
different
lady
hunstanton
but
my
dear
gerald
at
your
age
you
shouldn
t
have
any
views
of
life
they
are
quite
out
of
place
you
must
be
guided
by
others
in
this
matter
lord
illingworth
has
made
you
the
most
flattering
offer
and
travelling
with
him
you
would
see
the
much
of
it
at
least
as
one
should
look
the
best
auspices
possible
and
stay
with
all
the
right
people
which
is
so
important
at
this
solemn
moment
in
your
career
gerald
i
don
t
want
to
see
the
world
i
ve
seen
enough
of
it
allonby
i
hope
you
don
t
think
you
have
exhausted
life
arbuthnot
when
a
man
says
that
one
knows
that
life
has
exhausted
him
gerald
i
don
t
wish
to
leave
my
mother
lady
hunstanton
now
gerald
that
is
pure
laziness
on
your
part
not
leave
your
mother
if
i
were
your
mother
i
would
insist
on
your
going
alice
alice
arbuthnot
s
compliments

lady
but
she
has
a
bad
headache
and
can
not
see
any
one
this
morning

bad
headache

am
so
sorry

her
up
to
hunstanton
this

gerald
i
am
afraid

hunstanton
lady
hunstanton
well
then
ah
if
you
had
a
father
gerald
he
wouldn
t
let
you
waste
your
life
here
he
would
send
you
off
with
lord
illingworth
at
once
but
mothers
are
so
weak
they
give
up
to
their
sons
in
everything
we
are
all
heart
all
heart
come
dear
i
must
call
at
the
rectory
and
inquire
for
daubeny

i
am
afraid
is
far
from
well
it
is
wonderful
how
the
archdeacon
bears
up
quite
wonderful

is
the
most
sympathetic
of
husbands

a
model

fondest

an
indian

indian
shawl
gerald
mother

have
just
written
to
him
arbuthnot
to
whom
gerald
to
my
father
i
have
written
to
tell
him
to
come
here
at
four
o
clock
this
afternoon
arbuthnot
he
shall
not
come
here
he
shall
not
cross
the
threshold
of
my
house
gerald
he
must
come
arbuthnot
gerald
if
you
are
going
away
with
lord
illingworth
go
at
once
go
before
it
kills
me
but
don
t
ask
me
to
meet
him
gerald
mother
you
don
t
understand
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
me
to
go
away
with
lord
illingworth
or
to
leave
you
surely
you
know
me
well
enough
for
that
no
i
have
written
to
him
to
arbuthnot
what
can
you
have
to
say
to
him
gerald
can
t
you
guess
mother
what
i
have
written
in
this
letter
arbuthnot
no
gerald
mother
surely
you
can
think
think
what
must
be
done
now
at
once
within
the
next
few
days
arbuthnot
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
gerald
i
have
written
to
lord
illingworth
to
tell
him
that
he
must
marry
you
arbuthnot
marry
me
gerald
mother
i
will
force
him
to
do
it
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
you
must
be
repaired
atonement
must
be
made
justice
may
be
slow
mother
but
it
comes
in
the
end
in
a
few
days
you
shall
be
lord
illingworth
s
lawful
wife
arbuthnot
but
gerald
i
will
insist
upon
his
doing
it
i
will
make
him
do
it
he
will
not
dare
to
refuse
arbuthnot
but
gerald
it
is
i
who
refuse
i
will
not
marry
lord
illingworth
gerald
not
marry
him
mother
arbuthnot
i
will
not
marry
him
gerald
but
you
don
t
understand
it
is
for
your
sake
i
am
talking
not
for
mine
this
marriage
this
necessary
marriage
this
marriage
which
for
obvious
reasons
must
inevitably
take
place
will
not
help
me
will
not
give
me
a
name
that
will
be
really
rightly
mine
to
bear
but
surely
it
will
be
something
for
you
that
you
my
mother
should
however
late
become
the
wife
of
the
man
who
is
my
father
will
not
that
be
something
arbuthnot
i
will
not
marry
him
gerald
mother
you
must
arbuthnot
i
will
not
you
talk
of
atonement
for
a
wrong
done
what
atonement
can
be
made
to
me
there
is
no
atonement
possible
i
am
disgraced
he
is
not
that
is
all
it
is
the
usual
history
of
a
man
and
a
woman
as
it
usually
happens
as
it
always
happens
and
the
ending
is
the
ordinary
ending
the
woman
suffers
the
man
goes
free
gerald
i
don
t
know
if
that
is
the
ordinary
ending
mother
i
hope
it
is
not
but
your
life
at
any
rate
shall
not
end
like
that
the
man
shall
make
whatever
reparation
is
possible
it
is
not
enough
it
does
not
wipe
out
the
past
i
know
that
but
at
least
it
makes
the
future
better
better
for
you
mother
arbuthnot
i
refuse
to
marry
lord
illingworth
gerald
if
he
came
to
you
himself
and
asked
you
to
be
his
wife
you
would
give
him
a
different
answer
remember
he
is
my
father
arbuthnot
if
he
came
himself
which
he
will
not
do
my
answer
would
be
the
same
remember
i
am
your
mother
gerald
mother
you
make
it
terribly
difficult
for
me
by
talking
like
that
and
i
can
t
understand
why
you
won
t
look
at
this
matter
from
the
right
from
the
only
proper
standpoint
it
is
to
take
away
the
bitterness
out
of
your
life
to
take
away
the
shadow
that
lies
on
your
name
that
this
marriage
must
take
place
there
is
no
alternative
and
after
the
marriage
you
and
i
can
go
away
together
but
the
marriage
must
take
place
first
it
is
a
duty
that
you
owe
not
merely
to
yourself
but
to
all
other
to
all
the
other
women
in
the
world
lest
he
betray
more
arbuthnot
i
owe
nothing
to
other
women
there
is
not
one
of
them
to
help
me
there
is
not
one
woman
in
the
world
to
whom
i
could
go
for
pity
if
i
would
take
it
or
for
sympathy
if
i
could
win
it
women
are
hard
on
each
other
that
girl
last
night
good
though
she
is
fled
from
the
room
as
though
i
were
a
tainted
thing
she
was
right
i
am
a
tainted
thing
but
my
wrongs
are
my
own
and
i
will
bear
them
alone
i
must
bear
them
alone
what
have
women
who
have
not
sinned
to
do
with
me
or
i
with
them
we
do
not
understand
each
other
hester
gerald
i
implore
you
to
do
what
i
ask
you
arbuthnot
what
son
has
ever
asked
of
his
mother
to
make
so
hideous
a
sacrifice
none
gerald
what
mother
has
ever
refused
to
marry
the
father
of
her
own
child
none
arbuthnot
let
me
be
the
first
then
i
will
not
do
it
gerald
mother
you
believe
in
religion
and
you
brought
me
up
to
believe
in
it
also
well
surely
your
religion
the
religion
that
you
taught
me
when
i
was
a
boy
mother
must
tell
you
that
i
am
right
you
know
it
you
feel
it
arbuthnot
i
do
not
know
it
i
do
not
feel
it
nor
will
i
ever
stand
before
god
s
altar
and
ask
god
s
blessing
on
so
hideous
a
mockery
as
a
marriage
between
me
and
george
harford
i
will
not
say
the
words
the
church
bids
us
to
say
i
will
not
say
them
i
dare
not
how
could
i
swear
to
love
the
man
i
loathe
to
honour
him
who
wrought
you
dishonour
to
obey
him
who
in
his
mastery
made
me
to
sin
no
marriage
is
a
sacrament
for
those
who
love
each
other
it
is
not
for
such
as
him
or
such
as
me
gerald
to
save
you
from
the
world
s
sneers
and
taunts
i
have
lied
to
the
world
for
twenty
years
i
have
lied
to
the
world
i
could
not
tell
the
world
the
truth
who
can
ever
but
not
for
my
own
sake
will
i
lie
to
god
and
in
god
s
presence
no
gerald
no
ceremony
or
shall
ever
bind
me
to
george
harford
it
may
be
that
i
am
too
bound
to
him
already
who
robbing
me
yet
left
me
richer
so
that
in
the
mire
of
my
life
i
found
the
pearl
of
price
or
what
i
thought
would
be
so
gerald
i
don
t
understand
you
now
arbuthnot
men
don
t
understand
what
mothers
are
i
am
no
different
from
other
women
except
in
the
wrong
done
me
and
the
wrong
i
did
and
my
very
heavy
punishments
and
great
disgrace
and
yet
to
bear
you
i
had
to
look
on
death
to
nurture
you
i
had
to
wrestle
with
it
death
fought
with
me
for
you
all
women
have
to
fight
with
death
to
keep
their
children
death
being
childless
wants
our
children
from
us
gerald
when
you
were
naked
i
clothed
you
when
you
were
hungry
i
gave
you
food
night
and
day
all
that
long
winter
i
tended
you
no
office
is
too
mean
no
care
too
lowly
for
the
thing
we
women
oh
how
loved
not
hannah
samuel
more
and
you
needed
love
for
you
were
weakly
and
only
love
could
have
kept
you
alive
only
love
can
keep
any
one
alive
and
boys
are
careless
often
and
without
thinking
give
pain
and
we
always
fancy
that
when
they
come
to
man
s
estate
and
know
us
better
they
will
repay
us
but
it
is
not
so
the
world
draws
them
from
our
side
and
they
make
friends
with
whom
they
are
happier
than
they
are
with
us
and
have
amusements
from
which
we
are
barred
and
interests
that
are
not
ours
and
they
are
unjust
to
us
often
for
when
they
find
life
bitter
they
blame
us
for
it
and
when
they
find
it
sweet
we
do
not
taste
its
sweetness
with
them
you
made
many
friends
and
went
into
their
houses
and
were
glad
with
them
and
i
knowing
my
secret
did
not
dare
to
follow
but
stayed
at
home
and
closed
the
door
shut
out
the
sun
and
sat
in
darkness
what
should
i
have
done
in
honest
households
my
past
was
ever
with
me
and
you
thought
i
didn
t
care
for
the
pleasant
things
of
life
i
tell
you
i
longed
for
them
but
did
not
dare
to
touch
them
feeling
i
had
no
right
you
thought
i
was
happier
working
amongst
the
poor
that
was
my
mission
you
imagined
it
was
not
but
where
else
was
i
to
go
the
sick
do
not
ask
if
the
hand
that
smooths
their
pillow
is
pure
nor
the
dying
care
if
the
lips
that
touch
their
brow
have
known
the
kiss
of
sin
it
was
you
i
thought
of
all
the
time
i
gave
to
them
the
love
you
did
not
need
lavished
on
them
a
love
that
was
not
theirs
and
you
thought
i
spent
too
much
of
my
time
in
going
to
church
and
in
church
duties
but
where
else
could
i
turn
god
s
house
is
the
only
house
where
sinners
are
made
welcome
and
you
were
always
in
my
heart
gerald
too
much
in
my
heart
for
though
day
after
day
at
morn
or
evensong
i
have
knelt
in
god
s
house
i
have
never
repented
of
my
sin
how
could
i
repent
of
my
sin
when
you
my
love
were
its
fruit
even
now
that
you
are
bitter
to
me
i
can
not
repent
i
do
not
you
are
more
to
me
than
innocence
i
would
rather
be
your
much
rather
have
been
always
pure
oh
don
t
you
see
don
t
you
understand
it
is
my
dishonour
that
has
made
you
so
dear
to
me
it
is
my
disgrace
that
has
bound
you
so
closely
to
me
it
is
the
price
i
paid
for
price
of
soul
and
makes
me
love
you
as
i
do
oh
don
t
ask
me
to
do
this
horrible
thing
child
of
my
shame
be
still
the
child
of
my
shame
gerald
mother
i
didn
t
know
you
loved
me
so
much
as
that
and
i
will
be
a
better
son
to
you
than
i
have
been
and
you
and
i
must
never
leave
each
other
but
mother
i
can
t
help
it

must
become
my
father
s
wife

must
marry
him

is
your
duty
hester
forwards
and
mrs
arbuthnot
no

shall
not
that
would
be
real
dishonour
the
first

have
ever
known
that
would
be
real
disgrace
the
first
to
touch
you
leave
him
and
come
with
me
there
are
other
countries
than
england

other
countries

very
wide
and
very
big
arbuthnot

garden

gerald
arbuthnot
towards
at
over
mantelpiece
and

into
alice
alice
a
gentleman
to
see
you
ma
am
arbuthnot
say
i
am
not
at
home

me
the
card
card
from
salver
and
looks
at
say
i
will
not
see
him
lord
illingworth
arbuthnot
him
in
the
glass
and
does
not
turn
alice
what
can
you
have
to
say
to
me
george
harford
you
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
you
must
leave
this
house
lord
illingworth
rachel
gerald
knows
everything
about
you
and
me
now
so
some
arrangement
must
be
come
to
that
will
suit
us
all
three
i
assure
you
he
will
find
in
me
the
most
charming
and
generous
of
fathers
arbuthnot
my
son
may
come
in
at
any
moment
i
saved
you
last
night
i
may
not
be
able
to
save
you
again
my
son
feels
my
dishonour
strongly
terribly
strongly
i
beg
you
to
go
lord
illingworth
last
night
was
excessively
unfortunate
that
silly
puritan
girl
making
a
scene
merely
because
i
wanted
to
kiss
her
what
harm
is
there
in
a
kiss
arbuthnot
a
kiss
may
ruin
a
human
life
george
harford
know
that
know
that
too
well
lord
illingworth
we
won
t
discuss
that
at
present
what
is
of
importance
as
yesterday
is
still
our
son
i
am
extremely
fond
of
him
as
you
know
and
odd
though
it
may
seem
to
you
i
admired
his
conduct
last
night
immensely
he
took
up
the
cudgels
for
that
pretty
prude
with
wonderful
promptitude
he
is
just
what
i
should
have
liked
a
son
of
mine
to
be
except
that
no
son
of
mine
should
ever
take
the
side
of
the
puritans
that
is
always
an
error
now
what
i
propose
is
this
arbuthnot
lord
illingworth
no
proposition
of
yours
interests
me
lord
illingworth
according
to
our
ridiculous
english
laws
i
can
t
legitimise
gerald
but
i
can
leave
him
my
property
illingworth
is
entailed
of
course
but
it
is
a
tedious
barrack
of
a
place
he
can
have
ashby
which
is
much
prettier
harborough
which
has
the
best
shooting
in
the
north
of
england
and
the
house
in
james
square
what
more
can
a
gentleman
require
in
this
world
arbuthnot
nothing
more
i
am
quite
sure
lord
illingworth
as
for
a
title
a
title
is
really
rather
a
nuisance
in
these
democratic
days
as
george
harford
i
had
everything
i
wanted
now
i
have
merely
everything
that
other
people
want
which
isn
t
nearly
so
pleasant
well
my
proposal
is
this
arbuthnot
i
told
you
i
was
not
interested
and
i
beg
you
to
go
lord
illingworth
the
boy
is
to
be
with
you
for
six
months
in
the
year
and
with
me
for
the
other
six
that
is
perfectly
fair
is
it
not
you
can
have
whatever
allowance
you
like
and
live
where
you
choose
as
for
your
past
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
except
myself
and
gerald
there
is
the
puritan
of
course
the
puritan
in
white
muslin
but
she
doesn
t
count
she
couldn
t
tell
the
story
without
explaining
that
she
objected
to
being
kissed
could
she
and
all
the
women
would
think
her
a
fool
and
the
men
think
her
a
bore
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
that
gerald
won
t
be
my
heir
i
needn
t
tell
you
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
marrying
arbuthnot
you
come
too
late
my
son
has
no
need
of
you
you
are
not
necessary
lord
illingworth
what
do
you
mean
rachel
arbuthnot
that
you
are
not
necessary
to
gerald
s
career
he
does
not
require
you
lord
illingworth
i
do
not
understand
you
arbuthnot
look
into
the
garden
lord
illingworth
and
goes
towards
you
had
better
not
let
them
see
you
you
bring
unpleasant
memories
lord
illingworth
out
and
she
loves
him
they
love
each
other
we
are
safe
from
you
and
we
are
going
away
lord
illingworth
where
arbuthnot
we
will
not
tell
you
and
if
you
find
us
we
will
not
know
you
you
seem
surprised
what
welcome
would
you
get
from
the
girl
whose
lips
you
tried
to
soil
from
the
boy
whose
life
you
have
shamed
from
the
mother
whose
dishonour
comes
from
you
lord
illingworth
you
have
grown
hard
rachel
arbuthnot
i
was
too
weak
once
it
is
well
for
me
that
i
have
changed
lord
illingworth
i
was
very
young
at
the
time
we
men
know
life
too
early
arbuthnot
and
we
women
know
life
too
late
that
is
the
difference
between
men
and
women
lord
illingworth
rachel
i
want
my
son
my
money
may
be
of
no
use
to
him
now
i
may
be
of
no
use
to
him
but
i
want
my
son
bring
us
together
rachel
you
can
do
it
if
you
choose
letter
on
arbuthnot
there
is
no
room
in
my
boy
s
life
for
you
he
is
not
interested
in
lord
illingworth
then
why
does
he
write
to
me
arbuthnot

do
you
mean
lord
illingworth

letter
is
this
up
arbuthnot
nothing

it
to
me

is
addressed
to

not
to

illingworth
and
in
gerald
s
handwriting

it
was
not
to
have
been
sent
it
is
a
letter
he
wrote
to
you
this
morning
before
he
saw
me
but
he
is
sorry
now

sorry

it
to
me

illingworth
it
belongs
to
me
down
and

all
the
you

read
this
letter

suppose
rachel
arbuthnot

lord
illingworth
you
know
what
is
in
it
arbuthnot
yes
lord
illingworth
i
don
t
admit
for
a
moment
that
the
boy
is
right
in
what
he
says
i
don
t
admit
that
it
is
any
duty
of
mine
to
marry
you
i
deny
it
entirely
but
to
get
my
son
back
i
am
i
