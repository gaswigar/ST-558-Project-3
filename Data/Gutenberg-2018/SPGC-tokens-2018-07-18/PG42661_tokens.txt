preface
with
our
general
discussion
of
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
dying
god
is
brought
to
a
conclusion
the
aspect
of
the
subject
with
which
we
are
here
chiefly
concerned
is
the
use
of
the
dying
god
as
a
scapegoat
to
free
his
worshippers
from
the
troubles
of
all
sorts
with
which
life
on
earth
is
beset
i
have
sought
to
trace
this
curious
usage
to
its
origin
to
decompose
the
idea
of
the
divine
scapegoat
into
the
elements
out
of
which
it
appears
to
be
compounded
if
i
am
right
the
idea
resolves
itself
into
a
simple
confusion
between
the
material
and
the
immaterial
between
the
real
possibility
of
transferring
a
physical
load
to
other
shoulders
and
the
supposed
possibility
of
transferring
our
bodily
and
mental
ailments
to
another
who
will
bear
them
for
us
when
we
survey
the
history
of
this
pathetic
fallacy
from
its
crude
inception
in
savagery
to
its
full
development
in
the
speculative
theology
of
civilized
nations
we
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
singular
power
which
the
human
mind
possesses
of
transmuting
the
leaden
dross
of
superstition
into
a
glittering
semblance
of
gold
certainly
in
nothing
is
this
alchemy
of
thought
more
conspicuous
than
in
the
process
which
has
refined
the
base
and
foolish
custom
of
the
scapegoat
into
the
sublime
conception
of
a
god
who
dies
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
along
with
the
discussion
of
the
scapegoat
i
have
included
in
this
volume
an
account
of
the
remarkable
religious
ritual
of
the
aztecs
in
which
the
theory
of
the
dying
god
found
its
most
systematic
and
most
tragic
expression
there
is
nothing
so
far
as
i
am
aware
to
shew
that
the
men
and
women
who
in
mexico
died
cruel
deaths
in
the
character
of
gods
and
goddesses
were
regarded
as
scapegoats
by
their
worshippers
and
executioners
the
intention
of
slaying
them
seems
rather
to
have
been
to
reinforce
by
a
river
of
human
blood
the
tide
of
life
which
might
else
grow
stagnant
and
stale
in
the
veins
of
the
deities
hence
the
aztec
ritual
which
prescribed
the
slaughter
the
roasting
alive
and
the
flaying
of
men
and
women
in
order
that
the
gods
might
remain
for
ever
young
and
strong
conforms
to
the
general
theory
of
deicide
which
i
have
offered
in
this
work
on
that
theory
death
is
a
portal
through
which
gods
and
men
alike
must
pass
to
escape
the
decrepitude
of
age
and
to
attain
the
vigour
of
eternal
youth
the
conception
may
be
said
to
culminate
in
the
brahmanical
doctrine
that
in
the
daily
sacrifice
the
body
of
the
creator
is
broken
anew
for
the
salvation
of
the
world

i
the
transference
of
evil
the
transference
to
inanimate
objects
in
the
preceding
parts
of
this
work
we
have
traced
the
practice
of
killing
a
god
among
peoples
in
the
hunting
pastoral
and
agricultural
stages
of
society
and
i
have
attempted
to
explain
the
motives
which
led
men
to
adopt
so
curious
a
custom
one
aspect
of
the
custom
still
remains
to
be
noticed
the
accumulated
misfortunes
and
sins
of
the
whole
people
are
sometimes
laid
upon
the
dying
god
who
is
supposed
to
bear
them
away
for
ever
leaving
the
people
innocent
and
happy
the
notion
that
we
can
transfer
our
guilt
and
sufferings
to
some
other
being
who
will
bear
them
for
us
is
familiar
to
the
savage
mind
it
arises
from
a
very
obvious
confusion
between
the
physical
and
the
mental
between
the
material
and
the
immaterial
because
it
is
possible
to
shift
a
load
of
wood
stones
or
what
not
from
our
own
back
to
the
back
of
another
the
savage
fancies
that
it
is
equally
possible
to
shift
the
burden
of
his
pains
and
sorrows
to
another
who
will
suffer
them
in
his
stead
upon
this
idea
he
acts
and
the
result
is
an
endless
number
of
very
unamiable
devices
for
palming
off
upon
some
one
else
the
trouble
which
a
man
shrinks
from
bearing
himself
in
short
the
principle
of
vicarious
suffering
is
commonly
understood
and
practised
by
races
who
stand
on
a
low
level
of
social
and
intellectual
culture
in
the
following
pages
i
shall
illustrate
the
theory
and
the
practice
as
they
are
found
among
savages
in
all
their
naked
simplicity
undisguised
by
the
refinements
of
metaphysics
and
the
subtleties
of
theology
the
devices
to
which
the
cunning
and
selfish
savage
resorts
for
the
sake
of
easing
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
neighbour
are
manifold
only
a
few
typical
examples
out
of
a
multitude
can
be
cited
at
the
outset
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
evil
of
which
a
man
seeks
to
rid
himself
need
not
be
transferred
to
a
person
it
may
equally
well
be
transferred
to
an
animal
or
a
thing
though
in
the
last
case
the
thing
is
often
only
a
vehicle
to
convey
the
trouble
to
the
first
person
who
touches
it
in
some
of
the
east
indian
islands
they
think
that
epilepsy
can
be
cured
by
striking
the
patient
on
the
face
with
the
leaves
of
certain
trees
and
then
throwing
them
away
the
disease
is
believed
to
have
passed
into
the
leaves
and
to
have
been
thrown
away
with
them
in
the
warramunga
and
tjingilli
tribes
of
central
australia
men
who
suffered
from
headache
have
often
been
seen
wearing
women
s
this
was
connected
with
the
belief
that
the
pain
in
the
head
would
pass
into
the
rings
and
that
then
it
could
be
thrown
away
with
them
into
the
bush
and
so
got
rid
of
effectually
the
natives
have
a
very
firm
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
this
treatment
in
the
same
way
when
a
man
suffers
from
internal
pain
usually
brought
on
by
overeating
his
wife
s
are
placed
on
his
stomach
the
evil
magic
which
is
causing
all
the
trouble
passes
into
them
and
they
are
then
thrown
away
into
the
bushes
where
the
magic
is
supposed
to
leave
them
after
a
time
they
are
searched
for
by
the
woman
who
brings
them
back
and
again
wears
them
in
the
ordinary
among
the
sihanaka
of
madagascar
when
a
man
is
very
sick
his
relatives
are
sometimes
bidden
by
the
diviner
to
cast
out
the
evil
by
means
of
a
variety
of
things
such
as
a
stick
of
a
particular
sort
of
tree
a
rag
a
pinch
of
earth
from
an
ant
s
nest
a
little
money
or
what
not
whatever
they
may
be
they
are
brought
to
the
patient
s
house
and
held
by
a
man
near
the
door
while
an
exorcist
stands
in
the
house
and
pronounces
the
formula
necessary
for
casting
out
the
disease
when
he
has
done
the
things
are
thrown
away
in
a
southward
direction
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
including
the
sick
man
if
he
has
strength
enough
shake
their
loose
robes
and
spit
towards
the
door
in
order
to
expedite
the
departure
of
the
malady
when
an
atkhan
of
the
aleutian
islands
had
committed
a
grave
sin
and
desired
to
unburden
himself
of
his
guilt
he
proceeded
as
follows
having
chosen
a
time
when
the
sun
was
clear
and
unclouded
he
picked
up
certain
weeds
and
carried
them
about
his
person
then
he
laid
them
down
and
calling
the
sun
to
witness
cast
his
sins
upon
them
after
which
having
eased
his
heart
of
all
that
weighed
upon
it
he
threw
the
weeds
into
the
fire
and
fancied
that
thus
he
cleansed
himself
of
his
guilt
in
vedic
times
a
younger
brother
who
married
before
his
elder
brother
was
thought
to
have
sinned
in
so
doing
but
there
was
a
ceremony
by
which
he
could
purge
himself
of
his
sin
fetters
of
were
laid
on
him
in
token
of
his
guilt
and
when
they
had
been
washed
and
sprinkled
they
were
flung
into
a
foaming
torrent
which
swept
them
away
while
the
evil
was
bidden
to
vanish
with
the
foam
of
the
stream
the
matse
negroes
of
togoland
think
that
the
river
awo
has
power
to
carry
away
the
sorrows
of
mankind
so
when
one
of
their
friends
has
died
and
their
hearts
are
heavy
they
go
to
the
river
with
leaves
of
the
raphia
palm
tied
round
their
necks
and
drums
in
their
hands
standing
on
the
bank
they
beat
the
drums
and
cast
the
leaves
into
the
stream
as
the
leaves
float
away
out
of
sight
to
the
sound
of
the
rippling
water
and
the
roll
of
the
drums
they
fancy
that
their
sorrow
too
is
lifted
from
them
similarly
the
ancient
greeks
imagined
that
the
pangs
of
love
might
be
healed
by
bathing
in
the
river
selemnus
the
indians
of
peru
sought
to
purify
themselves
from
their
sins
by
plunging
their
heads
in
a
river
they
said
that
the
river
washed
their
sins
away
an
arab
cure
for
melancholy
or
madness
caused
by
love
is
to
put
a
dish
of
water
on
the
sufferer
s
head
drop
melted
lead
into
it
and
then
bury
the
lead
in
an
open
field
thus
the
mischief
that
was
in
the
man
goes
away
amongst
the
miotse
of
china
when
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
attains
the
age
of
seven
years
a
ceremony
called
driving
away
the
devil
takes
place
the
father
makes
a
kite
of
straw
and
lets
it
fly
away
in
the
desert
bearing
away
all
evil
with
it
when
an
indian
of
santiago
tepehuacan
is
ill
he
will
sometimes
attempt
to
rid
himself
of
the
malady
by
baking
thrice
seven
cakes
of
these
he
places
seven
in
the
top
of
the
highest
of
the
forest
seven
he
lays
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
seven
he
casts
into
a
well
with
the
water
of
which
he
then
washes
himself
by
this
means
he
transfers
the
sickness
to
the
water
of
the
well
and
so
is
made
whole
the
baganda
believed
that
plague
was
caused
by
the
god
kaumpuli
who
resided
in
a
deep
hole
in
his
temple
to
prevent
him
from
escaping
and
devastating
the
country
they
battened
him
down
in
the
hole
by
covering
the
top
with
and
piling
over
them
there
was
nothing
like
to
keep
him
down
so
hundreds
of
wild
cats
were
hunted
and
killed
every
year
to
supply
the
necessary
skins
however
sometimes
in
spite
of
these
precautions
the
god
contrived
to
escape
and
then
the
people
died
when
a
garden
or
house
was
the
priests
purified
it
by
transferring
the
disease
to
a
and
then
carrying
away
the
tree
to
a
piece
of
waste
land
the
way
in
which
they
effected
the
transference
of
the
disease
was
this
they
first
made
a
number
of
little
shields
and
spears
out
of
plantain
fibre
and
reeds
and
placed
them
at
intervals
along
the
path
leading
from
the
garden
to
the
main
road
a
young
about
to
bear
fruit
was
then
cut
down
the
stem
was
laid
in
the
path
leading
to
one
of
the
huts
and
it
was
speared
with
not
less
than
twenty
reed
spears
which
were
left
sticking
in
it
while
some
of
the
shields
were
also
fastened
to
it
this
tree
was
then
carried
down
the
path
to
the
waste
land
and
left
there
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
scapegoat
to
make
quite
sure
that
the
plague
after
being
thus
deposited
in
the
wilderness
should
not
return
by
the
way
it
went
the
priests
raised
an
arch
covered
with
barkcloth
over
the
path
at
the
point
where
it
diverged
from
the
main
road
this
arch
was
thought
to
interpose
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
return
of
the
plague
dyak
priestesses
expel
from
a
house
by
hewing
and
slashing
the
air
in
every
corner
of
it
with
wooden
swords
which
they
afterwards
wash
in
the
river
to
let
the
float
away
down
stream
sometimes
they
sweep
misfortune
out
of
the
house
with
brooms
made
of
the
leaves
of
certain
plants
and
sprinkled
with
and
blood
having
swept
it
clean
out
of
every
room
and
into
a
made
of
bamboo
they
set
the
little
house
with
its
load
of
bad
luck
adrift
on
the
river
the
current
carries
it
away
out
to
sea
where
it
shifts
its
baleful
cargo
to
a
certain
ship
which
floats
in
and
receives
in
its
capacious
hold
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
well
would
it
be
with
mankind
if
the
evils
remained
for
ever
tossing
far
away
on
the
billows
but
alas
they
are
dispersed
from
the
ship
to
the
four
winds
and
settle
again
and
yet
again
on
the
weary
dyak
world
on
dyak
rivers
you
may
see
many
of
the
miniature
houses
laden
with
manifold
misfortunes
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
current
or
sticking
fast
in
the
thickets
that
line
the
banks
these
examples
illustrate
the
purely
beneficent
side
of
the
transference
of
evil
they
shew
how
men
seek
to
alleviate
human
sufferings
by
diverting
them
to
material
objects
which
are
then
thrown
away
or
otherwise
disposed
of
so
as
to
render
them
innocuous
often
however
the
transference
of
evil
to
a
material
object
is
only
a
step
towards
foisting
it
upon
a
living
person
this
is
the
maleficent
side
of
such
transferences
it
is
exemplified
in
the
following
cases
to
cure
toothache
some
of
the
australian
blacks
apply
a
heated
to
the
cheek
the
is
then
cast
away
and
the
toothache
goes
with
it
in
the
shape
of
a
black
stone
called
stones
of
this
kind
are
found
in
old
mounds
and
sandhills
they
are
carefully
collected
and
thrown
in
the
direction
of
enemies
in
order
to
give
them
toothache
in
mirzapur
a
mode
of
transferring
disease
is
to
fill
a
pot
with
flowers
and
rice
and
bury
it
in
a
pathway
covered
up
with
a
flat
stone
whoever
touches
this
is
supposed
to
contract
the
disease
the
practice
is
called
or
passing
on
the
malady
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
daily
in
upper
india
often
while
walking
of
a
morning
in
the
bazaar
you
will
see
a
little
pile
of
earth
adorned
with
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
road
such
a
pile
usually
contains
some
scabs
or
scales
from
the
body
of
a
smallpox
patient
which
are
placed
there
in
the
hope
that
some
one
may
touch
them
and
by
catching
the
disease
may
relieve
the
sufferer
the
bahima
a
pastoral
people
of
the
uganda
protectorate
often
suffer
from
abscesses
their
cure
for
this
is
to
transfer
the
disease
to
some
other
person
by
obtaining
herbs
from
the
rubbing
them
over
the
place
where
the
swelling
is
and
burying
them
in
the
road
where
people
continually
pass
the
first
person
who
steps
over
these
buried
herbs
contracts
the
disease
and
the
original
patient
the
practice
of
the
wagogo
of
german
east
africa
is
similar
when
a
man
is
ill
the
native
doctor
will
take
him
to
a
where
he
prepares
his
medicines
uttering
at
the
same
time
the
incantations
which
are
necessary
to
give
the
drugs
their
medical
virtue
part
of
the
dose
is
then
administered
to
the
patient
and
part
is
buried
under
a
pot
turned
upside
down
at
the
it
is
hoped
that
somebody
will
step
over
the
pot
and
catching
the
disease
which
lurks
in
the
pot
will
thereby
relieve
the
original
sufferer
a
variation
of
this
cure
is
to
plaster
some
of
the
medicine
or
a
little
of
the
patient
s
blood
on
a
wooden
peg
and
to
drive
the
peg
into
a
tree
any
one
who
passes
the
tree
and
is
so
imprudent
as
to
draw
out
the
peg
will
carry
away
with
it
the
disease
sometimes
in
case
of
sickness
the
malady
is
transferred
to
an
effigy
as
a
preliminary
to
passing
it
on
to
a
human
being
thus
among
the
baganda
the
would
sometimes
make
a
model
of
his
patient
in
clay
then
a
relative
of
the
sick
man
would
rub
the
image
over
the
sufferer
s
body
and
either
bury
it
in
the
road
or
hide
it
in
the
grass
by
the
wayside
the
first
person
who
stepped
over
the
image
or
passed
by
it
would
catch
the
disease
sometimes
the
effigy
was
made
out
of
a
tied
up
so
as
to
look
like
a
person
it
was
used
in
the
same
way
as
the
clay
figure
but
the
use
of
images
for
this
maleficent
purpose
was
a
capital
crime
any
person
caught
in
the
act
of
burying
one
of
them
in
the
public
road
would
surely
have
been
put
to
death
among
the
people
to
the
north
of
the
zambesi
when
any
one
is
ill
the
doctor
makes
a
little
pig
of
straw
to
which
he
transfers
the
sickness
the
little
pig
is
then
set
on
the
ground
where
two
paths
meet
and
any
who
chances
to
kick
it
over
is
sure
to
absorb
the
illness
and
to
draw
it
away
from
the
patient
among
the
korkus
a
forest
tribe
of
the
central
provinces
in
india
when
a
person
wishes
to
transfer
his
sickness
to
another
he
contrives
to
obtain
the
of
his
intended
victim
and
paints
two
figures
on
it
in
lamp
black
one
upright
and
the
other
upside
down
as
soon
as
the
owner
of
the
puts
it
on
he
falls
a
victim
to
the
ailment
which
afflicted
the
artist
who
drew
the
figures
every
nine
years
a
mongol
celebrates
a
memorial
festival
of
his
birth
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
the
continuance
of
his
life
and
welfare
at
this
solemn
ceremony
two
lambskins
one
black
and
the
other
white
are
spread
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
which
is
further
covered
with
a
felt
carpet
and
on
the
carpet
are
made
nine
little
ridges
of
earth
brought
from
nine
mountains
the
bottom
of
a
river
and
a
sepulchral
mound
the
owner
of
the
hut
for
whose
benefit
the
rite
is
performed
next
seats
himself
on
the
black
lambskin
and
opposite
him
is
set
an
effigy
of
himself
made
of
dough
by
a
lama
the
priest
then
throws
a
black
stone
at
the
effigy
praying
that
the
black
arrow
of
death
may
pierce
it
after
which
he
throws
a
white
stone
at
the
master
of
the
hut
praying
that
the
bright
beam
of
life
may
endow
him
with
wondrous
strength
after
that
the
mongol
gets
up
steps
over
one
of
the
ridges
of
earth
and
says
i
have
overcome
a
mishap
i
have
escaped
a
this
ceremony
he
performs
nine
times
stepping
over
all
the
ridges
one
after
the
other
then
he
sits
down
on
the
white
lambskin
and
the
lama
takes
the
dough
effigy
swings
it
thrice
round
the
man
whom
it
represents
spits
on
it
thrice
and
hands
it
to
attendants
who
carry
it
away
into
the
steppe
a
little
holy
water
sprinkled
over
the
mongol
now
completes
his
protection
against
perils
and
dangers
this
last
is
a
case
of
the
beneficent
transference
of
evil
for
in
it
no
attempt
seems
to
be
made
to
shift
the
burden
of
misfortune
to
anybody
else
the
transference
to
stones
and
sticks
in
the
western
district
of
the
island
of
timor
when
men
or
women
are
making
long
and
tiring
journeys
they
fan
themselves
with
leafy
branches
which
they
afterwards
throw
away
on
particular
spots
where
their
forefathers
did
the
same
before
them
the
fatigue
which
they
felt
is
thus
supposed
to
have
passed
into
the
leaves
and
to
be
left
behind
others
use
stones
instead
of
leaves
similarly
in
the
babar
archipelago
tired
people
will
strike
themselves
with
stones
believing
that
they
thus
transfer
to
the
stones
the
weariness
which
they
felt
in
their
own
bodies
they
then
throw
away
the
stones
in
places
which
are
specially
set
apart
for
the
purpose
a
like
belief
and
practice
in
many
distant
parts
of
the
world
have
given
rise
to
those
cairns
or
heaps
of
sticks
and
leaves
which
travellers
often
observe
beside
the
path
and
to
which
every
passing
native
adds
his
contribution
in
the
shape
of
a
stone
or
stick
or
leaf
thus
in
the
solomon
and
banks
islands
the
natives
are
wont
to
throw
sticks
stones
or
leaves
upon
a
heap
at
a
place
of
steep
descent
or
where
a
difficult
path
begins
saying
there
goes
my
the
act
is
not
a
religious
rite
for
the
thing
thrown
on
the
heap
is
not
an
offering
to
spiritual
powers
and
the
words
which
accompany
the
act
are
not
a
prayer
it
is
nothing
but
a
magical
ceremony
for
getting
rid
of
fatigue
which
the
simple
savage
fancies
he
can
embody
in
a
stick
leaf
or
stone
and
so
cast
it
from
him
an
early
spanish
missionary
to
nicaragua
observing
that
along
the
paths
there
were
heaps
of
stones
on
which
the
indians
as
they
passed
threw
grass
asked
them
why
they
did
so
because
we
think
was
the
answer
that
thereby
we
are
kept
from
weariness
and
hunger
or
at
least
that
we
suffer
less
from
when
the
peruvian
indians
were
climbing
steep
mountains
and
felt
weary
they
used
to
halt
by
the
way
at
certain
points
where
there
were
heaps
of
stones
which
they
called
on
these
heaps
the
weary
men
would
place
other
stones
and
they
said
that
when
they
did
so
their
weariness
left
them
in
the
passes
of
the
eastern
andes
on
the
borders
of
argentina
and
bolivia
large
cairns
are
constantly
found
and
every
puna
indian
on
passing
adds
a
stone
and
a
coca
leaf
so
that
neither
he
nor
his
beast
of
burden
may
tire
on
the
in
the
country
of
the
tarahumares
and
tepehuanes
in
mexico
heaps
of
stones
and
sticks
may
be
observed
on
high
points
where
the
track
leads
over
a
ridge
between
two
or
more
valleys
every
indian
who
passes
such
a
pile
adds
a
stone
or
a
stick
to
it
in
order
to
gain
strength
for
his
journey
among
the
tarahumares
only
the
old
men
observe
this
custom
whenever
the
tepehuanes
carry
a
corpse
they
rest
it
for
some
fifteen
minutes
on
such
a
heap
by
the
wayside
that
the
deceased
may
not
be
fatigued
but
strong
enough
to
finish
his
long
journey
to
the
land
of
the
dead
one
of
my
huichol
companions
stopped
on
reaching
this
pile
pulled
up
some
grass
from
the
ground
and
picked
up
a
stone
as
big
as
his
fist
holding
both
together
he
spat
on
the
grass
and
on
the
stone
and
then
rubbed
them
quickly
over
his
knees
he
also
made
a
couple
of
passes
with
them
over
his
chest
and
shoulders
exclaiming
may
i
not
get
tired
and
then
put
the
grass
on
the
heap
and
the
stone
on
top
of
the
in
guatemala
also
piles
of
stones
may
be
seen
at
the
partings
of
ways
and
on
the
tops
of
cliffs
and
mountains
every
passing
indian
used
to
gather
a
handful
of
grass
rub
his
legs
with
it
spit
on
it
and
deposit
it
with
a
small
stone
on
the
pile
firmly
persuaded
that
by
so
doing
he
would
restore
their
flagging
vigour
to
his
weary
limbs
here
the
rubbing
of
the
limbs
with
the
grass
like
the
babar
custom
of
striking
the
body
with
a
stone
was
doubtless
a
mode
of
extracting
the
fatigue
from
them
as
a
preliminary
to
throwing
it
away
similarly
on
the
plateau
between
lakes
tanganyika
and
nyassa
the
native
carriers
before
they
ascend
a
steep
hill
with
their
loads
will
pick
up
a
stone
spit
on
it
rub
the
calves
of
their
legs
with
it
and
then
deposit
it
on
one
of
those
small
piles
of
stones
which
are
commonly
to
be
found
at
such
spots
in
this
part
of
africa
a
recent
english
traveller
who
noticed
the
custom
was
informed
that
the
carriers
practise
it
to
make
their
legs
light
in
other
words
to
extract
the
fatigue
from
them
on
the
banks
of
the
kei
river
in
southern
africa
another
english
traveller
noticed
some
heaps
of
stones
on
enquiring
what
they
meant
he
was
told
by
his
guides
that
when
a
caffre
felt
weary
he
had
but
to
add
a
stone
to
the
heap
to
regain
fresh
vigour
in
some
parts
of
south
africa
particularly
on
the
zambesi
piles
of
sticks
take
the
place
of
cairns
sometimes
the
natives
will
rub
their
leg
with
a
stick
and
throw
the
stick
on
the
heap
to
get
rid
of
fatigue
they
avow
others
say
that
throwing
a
stone
on
the
heap
gives
one
fresh
vigour
for
the
from
other
accounts
of
the
caffre
custom
we
learn
that
these
cairns
are
generally
on
the
sides
or
tops
of
mountains
and
that
before
a
native
deposits
his
stone
on
the
pile
he
spits
on
it
the
practice
of
spitting
on
the
stone
which
the
weary
wayfarer
lays
on
the
pile
is
probably
a
mode
of
transferring
his
fatigue
the
more
effectually
to
the
material
vehicle
which
is
to
rid
him
of
it
we
have
seen
that
the
practice
prevails
among
the
indians
of
guatemala
and
the
natives
of
the
tanganyika
plateau
and
it
appears
to
be
observed
also
under
similar
circumstances
in
corea
where
the
cairns
are
to
be
found
especially
on
the
tops
of
passes
from
the
primitive
point
of
view
nothing
can
be
more
natural
than
that
the
cairns
or
the
heaps
of
sticks
and
leaves
to
which
the
tired
traveller
adds
his
contribution
should
stand
at
the
top
of
passes
and
in
general
on
the
highest
points
of
the
road
the
wayfarer
who
has
toiled
with
aching
limbs
and
throbbing
temples
up
a
long
and
steep
ascent
is
aware
of
a
sudden
alleviation
as
soon
as
he
has
reached
the
summit
he
feels
as
if
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
him
and
to
the
savage
with
his
concrete
mode
of
thought
it
seems
natural
and
easy
to
cast
the
weight
from
him
in
the
shape
of
a
stone
or
stick
or
a
bunch
of
leaves
or
of
grass
hence
it
is
that
the
piles
which
represent
the
accumulated
weariness
of
many
and
travellers
are
to
be
seen
wherever
the
road
runs
highest
in
the
lofty
regions
of
bolivia
tibet
bhootan
and
burma
in
the
passes
of
the
andes
and
the
himalayas
as
well
as
in
corea
caffraria
guatemala
and
melanesia
while
the
mountaineer
indians
of
south
america
imagine
that
they
can
rid
themselves
of
their
fatigue
in
the
shape
of
a
stick
or
a
stone
other
or
the
same
aborigines
of
that
continent
believe
that
they
can
let
it
out
with
their
blood
a
french
explorer
who
had
seen
much
of
the
south
american
indians
tells
us
that
they
explain
everything
that
they
experience
by
attributing
it
to
sorcery
to
the
influence
of
maleficent
beings
thus
an
indian
on
the
march
when
he
feels
weary
never
fails
to
ascribe
his
weariness
to
the
evil
spirit
and
if
he
has
no
diviner
at
hand
he
wounds
himself
in
the
knees
the
shoulders
and
on
the
arms
in
order
to
let
out
the
evil
with
the
blood
that
is
why
many
indians
especially
the
aucas
araucanians
have
always
their
arms
covered
with
scars
this
custom
differently
applied
is
almost
general
in
america
for
i
found
it
up
to
the
foot
of
the
andes
in
bolivia
among
the
chiriguana
and
yuracares
but
it
is
not
mere
bodily
fatigue
which
the
savage
fancies
he
can
rid
himself
of
by
the
simple
expedient
of
throwing
a
stick
or
a
stone
unable
clearly
to
distinguish
the
immaterial
from
the
material
the
abstract
from
the
concrete
he
is
assailed
by
vague
terrors
he
feels
himself
exposed
to
some
danger
on
the
scene
of
any
great
crime
or
great
misfortune
the
place
to
him
seems
haunted
ground
the
thronging
memories
that
crowd
upon
his
mind
if
they
are
not
mistaken
by
him
for
goblins
and
phantoms
oppress
his
fancy
with
a
leaden
weight
his
impulse
is
to
flee
from
the
dreadful
spot
to
shake
off
the
burden
that
seems
to
cling
to
him
like
a
nightmare
this
in
his
simple
sensuous
way
he
thinks
he
can
do
by
casting
something
at
the
horrid
place
and
hurrying
by
for
will
not
the
contagion
of
misfortune
the
horror
that
clutched
at
his
be
diverted
from
himself
into
the
thing
will
it
not
gather
up
in
itself
all
the
evil
influences
that
threatened
him
and
so
leave
him
to
pursue
his
journey
in
safety
and
peace
some
such
train
of
thought
if
these
gropings
and
fumblings
of
a
mind
in
darkness
deserve
the
name
of
thought
seems
to
explain
the
custom
observed
by
wayfarers
in
many
lands
of
throwing
sticks
or
stones
on
places
where
something
horrible
has
happened
or
evil
deeds
have
been
done
when
sir
francis
younghusband
was
travelling
across
the
great
desert
of
gobi
his
caravan
descended
towards
dusk
on
a
june
evening
into
a
long
depression
between
the
hills
which
was
notorious
as
a
haunt
of
robbers
his
guide
with
a
face
told
how
not
long
before
nine
men
out
of
a
single
caravan
had
been
murdered
and
the
rest
left
in
a
pitiable
state
to
continue
their
journey
on
foot
across
the
awful
desert
a
horseman
too
had
just
been
seen
riding
towards
the
hills
we
had
accordingly
to
keep
a
sharp
and
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
hills
halted
and
taking
the
loads
off
the
camels
wrapped
ourselves
up
in
our
sheepskins
and
watched
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
day
broke
at
last
and
then
we
silently
advanced
and
entered
the
hills
very
weird
and
fantastic
in
their
rugged
outline
were
they
and
here
and
there
a
cairn
of
stones
marked
where
some
caravan
had
been
attacked
and
as
we
passed
these
each
man
threw
one
more
stone
on
the
in
the
norwegian
district
of
tellemarken
a
cairn
is
piled
up
wherever
anything
fearful
has
happened
and
every
must
throw
another
stone
on
it
or
some
evil
will
befall
him
in
sweden
and
the
esthonian
island
of
oesel
the
same
custom
is
practised
on
scenes
of
clandestine
or
illicit
love
with
the
strange
addition
in
oesel
that
when
a
man
has
lost
his
cattle
he
will
go
to
such
a
spot
and
while
he
flings
a
stick
or
stone
on
it
will
say
i
bring
thee
wood
let
me
soon
find
my
lost
far
from
these
northern
lands
the
dyaks
of
batang
lupar
keep
up
an
observance
of
the
same
sort
in
the
forests
of
borneo
beside
their
paths
may
be
seen
heaps
of
sticks
or
stones
which
are
called
lying
each
heap
is
in
memory
of
some
man
who
told
a
stupendous
lie
or
disgracefully
failed
in
carrying
out
an
engagement
and
everybody
who
passes
adds
a
stick
or
stone
to
the
pile
saying
as
he
does
so
for
s
lying
the
dyaks
think
it
a
sacred
duty
to
add
to
every
such
liar
s
mound
which
they
pass
they
imagine
that
the
omission
of
the
duty
would
draw
down
on
them
a
supernatural
punishment
hence
however
pressed
a
dyak
may
be
for
time
he
will
always
stop
to
throw
on
the
pile
some
branches
or
twigs
the
person
to
start
such
a
heap
is
one
of
the
men
who
has
suffered
by
a
malicious
lie
he
takes
a
stick
throws
it
down
on
some
spot
where
people
are
constantly
passing
and
says
let
any
one
who
does
not
add
to
this
liar
s
heap
suffer
from
pains
in
the
others
then
do
likewise
and
every
throws
a
stick
on
the
spot
lest
he
should
suffer
pains
in
this
way
the
heap
often
grows
to
a
large
size
and
the
liar
by
whose
name
it
is
known
is
greatly
ashamed
but
it
is
on
scenes
of
murder
and
sudden
death
that
this
rude
method
of
averting
evil
is
most
commonly
practised
the
custom
that
every
must
cast
a
stone
or
stick
on
the
spot
where
some
one
has
come
to
a
violent
end
whether
by
murder
or
otherwise
has
been
observed
in
practically
the
same
form
in
such
many
and
diverse
parts
of
the
world
as
ireland
france
spain
sweden
germany
bohemia
lesbos
morocco
armenia
palestine
arabia
india
north
america
venezuela
bolivia
celebes
and
new
zealand
in
fiji
for
example
it
was
the
practice
for
every
to
throw
a
leaf
on
the
spot
where
a
man
had
been
clubbed
to
death
this
was
considered
as
an
offering
of
respect
to
him
and
if
not
performed
they
have
a
notion
they
will
soon
be
killed
sometimes
the
scene
of
the
murder
or
death
may
also
be
the
grave
of
the
victim
but
it
need
not
always
be
so
and
in
europe
where
the
dead
are
buried
in
consecrated
ground
the
two
places
would
seldom
coincide
however
the
custom
of
throwing
stones
or
sticks
on
a
grave
has
undoubtedly
been
observed
by
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
that
too
even
when
the
graves
are
not
those
of
persons
who
have
come
to
a
violent
end
thus
we
are
told
that
the
people
of
unalashka
one
of
the
aleutian
islands
bury
their
dead
on
the
summits
of
hills
and
raise
a
little
hillock
over
the
grave
in
a
walk
into
the
country
one
of
the
natives
who
attended
me
pointed
out
several
of
these
receptacles
of
the
dead
there
was
one
of
them
by
the
side
of
the
road
leading
from
the
harbour
to
the
village
over
which
was
raised
a
heap
of
stones
it
was
observed
that
every
one
who
passed
it
added
one
to
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
think
that
a
dying
man
should
have
a
burning
candle
in
his
hand
and
that
any
one
who
dies
without
a
light
has
no
right
to
the
ordinary
funeral
ceremonies
the
body
of
such
an
unfortunate
is
not
laid
in
holy
ground
but
is
buried
wherever
it
may
be
found
his
grave
is
marked
only
by
a
heap
of
dry
branches
to
which
each
is
expected
to
add
a
handful
of
twigs
or
a
thorny
bough
the
hottentot
god
or
hero
died
several
times
and
came
to
life
again
when
the
hottentots
pass
one
of
his
numerous
graves
they
throw
a
stone
a
bush
or
a
fresh
branch
on
it
for
good
luck
near
the
former
of
blydeuitzigt
in
cape
colony
there
was
a
spot
called
devil
s
neck
where
in
the
opinion
of
the
bushmen
the
devil
was
interred
to
hinder
his
resurrection
stones
were
piled
in
heaps
about
the
place
when
a
bushman
travelling
in
the
company
of
a
missionary
came
in
sight
of
the
spot
he
seized
a
stone
and
hurled
it
at
the
grave
remarking
that
if
he
did
not
do
so
his
neck
would
be
twisted
round
so
that
he
would
have
to
look
backwards
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
stones
are
cast
by
on
the
graves
of
murderers
in
some
parts
of
senegambia
in
syria
deceased
robbers
are
not
buried
like
honest
folk
but
left
to
rot
where
they
lie
and
a
pile
of
stones
is
raised
over
the
mouldering
corpse
every
one
who
passes
such
a
pile
must
fling
a
stone
at
it
on
pain
of
incurring
god
s
malison
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
ago
an
englishman
was
travelling
from
sidon
to
tyre
with
a
couple
of
musalmans
when
he
drew
near
tyre
his
companions
picked
up
some
small
stones
armed
him
in
the
same
fashion
and
requested
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
follow
their
example
soon
afterwards
they
came
in
sight
of
a
conical
heap
of
pebbles
and
stones
standing
in
the
road
at
which
the
two
musalmans
hurled
stones
and
curses
with
great
vehemence
and
remarkable
volubility
when
they
had
discharged
this
pious
duty
to
their
satisfaction
they
explained
that
the
missiles
and
maledictions
were
directed
at
a
celebrated
robber
and
murderer
who
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
and
buried
there
some
half
a
century
before
in
these
latter
cases
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
the
sticks
and
stones
serve
no
other
purpose
than
to
keep
off
the
angry
and
dangerous
ghost
who
might
be
supposed
to
haunt
either
the
place
of
death
or
the
grave
this
interpretation
seems
certainly
to
apply
to
some
cases
of
the
custom
for
example
in
pomerania
and
west
prussia
the
ghosts
of
suicides
are
much
feared
such
persons
are
buried
not
in
the
churchyard
but
at
the
place
where
they
took
their
lives
and
every
must
cast
a
stone
or
a
stick
on
the
spot
or
the
ghost
of
the
suicide
will
haunt
him
by
night
and
give
him
no
rest
hence
the
piles
of
sticks
or
stones
accumulated
on
the
graves
of
these
poor
wretches
sometimes
attain
a
considerable
size
similarly
the
baganda
of
central
africa
used
to
stand
in
great
fear
of
the
ghosts
of
suicides
and
they
took
many
precautions
to
disarm
or
even
destroy
these
dangerous
spirits
for
this
purpose
the
bodies
of
suicides
were
removed
to
waste
land
or
and
burned
there
together
with
the
wood
of
the
house
in
which
the
deed
had
been
done
or
of
the
tree
on
which
the
person
had
hanged
himself
by
these
means
they
imagined
that
they
destroyed
the
ghost
so
that
he
could
not
come
and
lure
others
to
follow
his
bad
example
lest
however
the
ghost
should
survive
the
destruction
of
his
body
by
fire
the
baganda
in
passing
any
place
where
a
suicide
had
been
burnt
always
threw
grass
or
sticks
on
the
spot
to
prevent
the
ghost
from
catching
them
and
they
did
the
same
for
the
same
reason
whenever
they
passed
the
places
on
waste
ground
where
persons
accused
of
witchcraft
and
found
guilty
by
the
poison
ordeal
had
been
burnt
to
death
baganda
women
had
a
special
reason
for
dreading
all
graves
which
were
believed
to
be
haunted
by
dangerous
ghosts
for
imagining
that
they
could
conceive
children
without
intercourse
with
the
other
sex
they
feared
to
be
impregnated
by
the
entrance
into
them
of
the
ghosts
of
suicides
and
other
unfortunate
or
uncanny
people
such
as
persons
with
a
light
complexion
twins
and
particularly
all
who
had
the
mishap
to
be
born
feet
foremost
for
that
reason
baganda
women
were
at
pains
whenever
they
passed
the
graves
of
any
such
persons
to
throw
sticks
or
grass
upon
them
for
by
so
doing
they
thought
that
they
could
prevent
the
ghost
of
the
dead
from
entering
into
them
and
being
hence
the
mounds
which
accumulated
over
these
graves
became
in
course
of
time
large
enough
to
deflect
the
path
and
to
attract
the
attention
of
travellers
it
was
not
merely
matrons
who
thus
took
care
not
to
become
mothers
unaware
the
same
fears
were
entertained
and
the
same
precautions
were
adopted
by
all
women
whether
old
or
young
whether
married
or
single
since
they
thought
that
there
was
no
woman
whatever
her
age
or
condition
who
might
not
be
impregnated
by
the
entrance
into
her
of
a
spirit
in
these
cases
therefore
the
throwing
of
sticks
or
grass
at
graves
is
a
purely
defensive
measure
the
missiles
are
intended
to
ward
off
the
assaults
of
dangerous
ghosts
similarly
we
are
told
that
in
madagascar
solitary
graves
by
the
wayside
have
a
sinister
reputation
and
that
without
looking
back
will
throw
stones
or
clods
at
them
to
prevent
the
evil
spirits
from
following
the
maraves
of
south
africa
like
the
baganda
used
to
burn
witches
alive
and
to
throw
stones
on
the
places
of
execution
whenever
they
passed
them
so
that
in
time
regular
cairns
gradually
rose
on
these
spots
no
doubt
with
these
maraves
as
with
the
baganda
the
motive
for
throwing
missiles
at
such
places
is
to
protect
themselves
against
the
ghosts
a
protective
motive
is
also
assigned
for
a
similar
custom
observed
in
chota
nagpur
a
region
of
india
which
is
the
home
of
many
primitive
tribes
there
heaps
of
stones
or
of
leaves
and
branches
may
often
be
seen
beside
the
path
they
are
supposed
to
mark
the
places
where
people
have
been
killed
by
wild
beasts
and
the
natives
think
that
any
who
failed
to
add
a
stone
or
a
stick
to
the
pile
would
himself
be
seized
and
devoured
by
a
wild
animal
here
though
the
ghost
is
not
explicitly
mentioned
we
may
perhaps
suppose
that
out
of
spite
he
is
instrumental
in
causing
others
to
perish
by
the
same
untimely
death
by
which
he
was
himself
carried
off
the
kayans
of
borneo
imagine
that
they
can
put
evil
spirits
to
flight
by
hurling
sticks
or
stones
at
them
so
on
a
journey
they
will
let
fly
volleys
of
such
missiles
at
the
rocks
and
dens
where
demons
are
known
to
reside
hence
whenever
the
throwing
of
stones
at
a
grave
is
regarded
as
an
insult
to
the
dead
we
may
suppose
that
the
missiles
are
intended
to
hit
and
hurt
the
ghost
thus
euripides
represents
the
murderer
aegisthus
as
leaping
on
the
tomb
of
his
victim
agamemnon
and
pelting
it
with
stones
and
propertius
invites
all
lovers
to
discharge
stones
and
curses
at
the
dishonoured
grave
of
an
old
bawd
but
if
this
theory
seems
adequately
to
account
for
some
cases
of
the
custom
with
which
we
are
concerned
it
apparently
fails
to
explain
others
the
view
that
the
sticks
and
stones
hurled
at
certain
places
are
weapons
turned
against
dangerous
or
malignant
spirits
is
plausible
in
cases
where
such
spirits
are
believed
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
but
in
cases
where
no
such
spirits
are
thought
to
be
lurking
we
must
it
would
seem
cast
about
for
some
other
explanation
for
example
we
have
seen
that
it
has
been
customary
to
throw
sticks
or
stones
on
spots
which
have
been
defiled
by
deeds
of
moral
turpitude
without
any
shedding
of
blood
and
again
on
spots
where
weary
travellers
stop
to
rest
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
in
these
latter
cases
the
evil
deeds
or
the
sensations
of
fatigue
are
conceived
in
the
concrete
shape
of
demons
whom
it
is
necessary
to
repel
by
missiles
though
many
south
american
indians
as
we
saw
do
attribute
fatigue
to
a
demon
still
more
difficult
is
it
to
apply
the
purely
defensive
theory
to
cases
where
beneficent
spirits
are
imagined
to
be
hovering
somewhere
near
and
where
the
throwing
of
the
stones
or
sticks
is
apparently
regarded
by
those
who
practise
it
as
a
token
of
respect
rather
than
of
hostility
thus
amongst
the
masai
when
any
one
dies
away
from
the
kraal
his
body
is
left
lying
on
the
spot
where
he
died
and
all
persons
present
throw
bunches
of
grass
or
leaves
on
the
corpse
afterwards
every
casts
a
stone
or
a
handful
of
grass
on
the
place
and
the
more
the
dead
man
was
respected
the
longer
is
the
usage
observed
it
is
especially
the
graves
of
masai
that
are
honoured
in
this
way
in
the
forest
near
avestad
in
sweden
the
traveller
clarke
observed
several
heaps
made
with
sticks
and
stones
upon
which
the
natives
as
they
pass
cast
either
a
stone
or
a
little
earth
or
the
bough
of
a
tree
deeming
it
an
uncharitable
act
to
omit
this
tribute
in
their
journeys
to
and
fro
as
this
custom
appeared
closely
allied
to
the
pious
practice
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
of
casting
a
stone
upon
the
cairn
of
a
deceased
person
we
of
course
concluded
these
heaps
were
places
of
they
were
said
to
be
the
graves
of
a
band
of
robbers
who
had
plundered
merchants
on
their
passage
through
the
forest
but
had
afterwards
been
killed
and
buried
where
they
fell
however
in
all
these
cases
the
practice
of
throwing
stones
on
the
grave
though
interpreted
as
a
mark
of
respect
and
charity
may
really
be
based
on
the
fear
of
the
ghosts
so
that
the
motive
for
observing
the
custom
may
be
merely
that
of
against
a
dangerous
spirit
yet
this
explanation
can
hardly
apply
to
certain
other
cases
thus
in
syria
it
is
a
common
practice
with
pious
moslems
when
they
first
come
in
sight
of
a
very
sacred
place
such
as
hebron
or
the
tomb
of
moses
to
make
a
little
heap
of
stones
or
to
add
a
stone
to
a
heap
which
has
been
already
made
hence
every
here
and
there
the
traveller
passes
a
whole
series
of
such
heaps
by
the
side
of
the
track
in
northern
africa
the
usage
is
similar
cairns
are
commonly
erected
on
spots
from
which
the
devout
pilgrim
first
discerns
the
shrine
of
a
saint
afar
off
hence
they
are
generally
to
be
seen
on
the
top
of
passes
for
example
in
morocco
at
the
point
of
the
road
from
casablanca
to
azemmour
where
you
first
come
in
sight
of
the
white
city
of
the
saint
gleaming
in
the
distance
there
rises
an
enormous
cairn
of
stones
shaped
like
a
pyramid
several
hundreds
of
feet
high
and
beyond
it
on
both
sides
of
the
road
there
is
a
sort
of
avalanche
of
stones
either
standing
singly
or
arranged
in
little
pyramids
every
pious
mohammedan
whose
eyes
are
gladdened
by
the
blessed
sight
of
the
sacred
town
adds
his
stone
to
one
of
the
piles
or
builds
a
little
pile
for
himself
such
a
custom
can
hardly
be
explained
as
a
precaution
adopted
against
a
dangerous
influence
supposed
to
emanate
from
the
saint
and
to
communicate
itself
even
to
people
at
a
distance
on
the
contrary
it
points
rather
to
a
desire
of
communion
with
the
holy
man
than
to
a
wish
to
keep
him
at
bay
the
mode
of
communion
adopted
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
us
is
apparently
quite
in
harmony
with
the
methods
by
which
good
mohammedans
in
northern
africa
attempt
to
appropriate
to
themselves
the
blessed
influence
which
is
supposed
to
radiate
on
all
sides
from
the
person
of
a
living
saint
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
we
are
told
the
extremity
to
which
the
belief
in
the
blessed
influence
of
saints
is
carried
in
north
africa
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
it
you
must
see
a
great
saint
in
the
midst
of
the
faithful
the
people
fling
themselves
down
on
his
path
to
kiss
the
skirt
of
his
robe
to
kiss
his
stirrup
if
he
is
on
horseback
to
kiss
even
his
footprint
if
he
is
on
foot
those
who
are
too
far
from
him
to
be
able
to
touch
his
hand
touch
him
with
their
staff
or
fling
a
stone
at
him
which
they
have
marked
previously
so
as
to
be
able
to
find
it
afterwards
and
to
embrace
it
thus
through
the
channel
of
the
stone
or
the
stick
which
has
been
in
bodily
contact
with
the
living
saint
his
blessed
influence
flows
to
the
devotee
who
has
wielded
the
stick
or
hurled
the
stone
in
like
manner
we
may
perhaps
suppose
that
the
man
who
adds
a
stone
to
a
cairn
in
honour
of
a
dead
saint
hopes
to
benefit
by
the
saintly
effluence
which
distils
in
a
mysterious
fashion
through
the
stone
to
him
when
we
survey
the
many
different
cases
in
which
passing
travellers
are
accustomed
to
add
stones
or
sticks
to
existing
piles
it
seems
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
explain
them
all
on
one
principle
different
and
even
opposite
motives
appear
at
least
at
first
sight
to
have
operated
in
different
cases
to
produce
customs
superficially
alike
sometimes
the
motive
for
throwing
the
stone
is
to
ward
off
a
dangerous
spirit
sometimes
it
is
to
cast
away
an
evil
sometimes
it
is
to
acquire
a
good
yet
perhaps
if
we
could
trace
them
back
to
their
origin
in
the
mind
of
primitive
man
we
might
find
that
they
all
resolve
themselves
more
or
less
exactly
into
the
principle
of
the
transference
of
evil
for
to
rid
ourselves
of
an
evil
and
to
acquire
a
good
are
often
merely
opposite
sides
of
one
and
the
same
operation
for
example
a
convalescent
regains
health
in
exactly
the
same
proportion
as
he
shakes
off
his
malady
and
though
the
practice
of
throwing
stones
at
dangerous
spirits
especially
at
mischievous
and
malignant
ghosts
of
the
dead
appears
to
spring
from
a
different
motive
yet
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
difference
is
really
as
great
to
the
savage
as
it
seems
to
us
to
primitive
man
the
idea
of
spiritual
and
ghostly
powers
is
still
more
indefinite
than
it
is
to
his
civilized
brother
it
fills
him
with
a
vague
uneasiness
and
alarm
and
this
sentiment
of
dread
and
horror
he
in
accordance
with
his
habitual
modes
of
thought
conceives
in
a
concrete
form
as
something
material
which
either
surrounds
and
oppresses
him
like
a
fog
or
has
entered
into
and
taken
temporary
possession
of
his
body
in
either
case
he
imagines
that
he
can
rid
himself
of
the
uncanny
thing
by
stripping
it
from
his
skin
or
wrenching
it
out
of
his
body
and
transferring
it
to
some
material
substance
whether
a
stick
a
stone
or
what
not
which
he
can
cast
from
him
and
so
being
eased
of
his
burden
can
hasten
away
from
the
dreadful
spot
with
a
lighter
heart
thus
the
throwing
of
the
sticks
or
stones
would
be
a
form
of
ceremonial
purification
which
among
primitive
peoples
is
commonly
conceived
as
a
sort
of
physical
rather
than
moral
purgation
a
mode
of
sweeping
or
scouring
away
the
morbid
matter
by
which
the
polluted
person
is
supposed
to
be
infected
this
notion
perhaps
explains
the
rite
of
observed
by
pilgrims
at
mecca
on
the
day
of
sacrifice
every
pilgrim
has
to
cast
seven
stones
on
a
cairn
and
the
rite
is
repeated
thrice
on
the
three
following
days
the
traditional
explanation
of
the
custom
is
that
mohammed
here
drove
away
the
devil
with
a
shower
of
stones
but
the
original
idea
may
perhaps
have
been
that
the
pilgrims
cleanse
themselves
by
transferring
their
ceremonial
impurity
to
the
stones
which
they
fling
on
the
heap
the
theory
that
the
throwing
of
stones
is
practised
in
certain
circumstances
as
a
mode
of
purification
tallies
very
well
with
the
tradition
as
to
the
origin
of
those
cairns
which
were
to
be
seen
by
wayside
images
of
hermes
in
ancient
greece
and
to
which
every
added
a
stone
it
was
said
that
when
hermes
was
tried
by
the
gods
for
the
murder
of
argus
all
the
gods
flung
stones
at
him
as
a
means
of
freeing
themselves
from
the
pollution
contracted
by
bloodshed
the
stones
thus
thrown
made
a
great
heap
and
the
custom
of
rearing
such
heaps
at
wayside
images
of
hermes
continued
ever
afterwards
similarly
plato
recommended
that
if
any
man
had
murdered
his
father
or
mother
his
brother
or
sister
his
son
or
daughter
he
should
be
put
to
death
and
that
his
body
should
be
cast
forth
naked
at
a
outside
of
the
city
there
the
magistrates
should
assemble
on
behalf
of
the
city
each
carrying
in
his
hand
a
stone
which
he
was
to
cast
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
by
way
of
purifying
the
city
from
the
pollution
it
had
contracted
by
the
crime
after
that
the
corpse
was
to
be
carried
away
and
flung
outside
the
boundaries
in
these
cases
it
would
seem
that
the
pollution
incurred
by
the
vicinity
of
a
murderer
is
thought
to
be
gathered
up
in
the
stones
as
a
material
vehicle
and
to
be
thrown
away
with
them
a
sacrificial
custom
of
the
brahmans
prescribed
in
one
of
their
sacred
books
is
susceptible
of
a
like
interpretation
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
ritual
the
sacrificer
is
directed
to
put
a
stone
into
a
and
to
throw
it
away
in
a
direction
because
that
is
the
region
of
nirriti
the
goddess
of
evil
or
destruction
with
the
stone
and
the
pitcher
he
is
supposed
to
cast
away
his
pain
and
evil
and
he
can
transfer
the
pain
to
another
by
saying
as
he
throws
away
the
stone
and
the
pitcher
let
thy
pain
enter
him
whom
we
hate
or
let
thy
pain
enter
naming
his
enemy
but
in
order
to
ensure
the
transference
of
the
pain
to
his
enemy
he
must
take
care
that
the
stone
or
the
pitcher
is
broken
this
mode
of
interpreting
the
custom
of
throwing
sticks
and
stones
on
piles
appears
preferable
to
the
one
which
has
generally
found
favour
with
european
travellers
and
writers
imperfectly
acquainted
for
the
most
part
with
the
notions
which
underlie
primitive
magic
but
very
familiar
with
the
religious
conception
of
a
deity
who
requires
sacrifice
of
his
worshippers
they
are
apt
to
interpret
the
missiles
in
question
as
cheap
and
easy
offerings
presented
by
pious
but
frugal
worshippers
to
ghosts
or
spirits
whose
favour
they
desire
to
win
whether
a
likely
mode
of
conciliating
a
ghost
or
spirit
is
to
throw
sticks
and
stones
at
him
is
a
question
about
which
opinions
might
perhaps
differ
it
is
difficult
to
speak
with
confidence
about
the
tastes
of
spiritual
beings
but
as
a
rule
they
bear
a
remarkable
likeness
to
those
of
mere
ordinary
mortals
and
it
may
be
said
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
few
of
the
latter
would
be
gratified
by
being
set
up
as
a
common
target
to
be
aimed
at
with
sticks
and
stones
by
everybody
who
passed
within
range
yet
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
ceremony
which
at
first
was
purely
magical
may
in
time
have
a
religious
gloss
or
interpretation
put
on
it
even
by
those
who
practise
it
and
this
seems
in
fact
to
have
sometimes
happened
to
the
particular
custom
under
consideration
certainly
some
people
accompany
the
throwing
of
the
stone
on
the
pile
with
the
presentation
of
useful
articles
which
can
hardly
serve
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
propitiating
some
local
spirits
thus
travellers
in
sikhim
and
bhootan
offer
flour
and
wine
as
well
as
stones
at
the
cairns
and
they
also
burn
incense
and
recite
incantations
or
prayers
or
they
tear
strips
from
their
garments
tie
them
to
twigs
or
stones
and
then
lay
them
on
the
cairn
calling
out
to
the
spirit
of
the
mountain
pray
accept
our
offering
the
spirits
are
victorious
the
devils

defeated
indians
of

means
a
little

they
now
burn
copal
and
sometimes
dance
on
the
tops
of
the
passes
where
the
cairns
are
to
be
seen
but
perhaps
these
devotions
may
be
paid
to
the
crosses
which
at
the
present
day
are
generally
set
up
in
such
situations
the
indian
of
bolivia
will
squirt
out
the
juice
of
his
or
throw
the
quid
itself
on
the
cairn
to
which
he
adds
a
stone
occasionally
he
goes
so
far
as
to
stick
feathers
or
a
leathern
sandal
or
two
on
the
pile
in
passing
the
cairns
he
will
sometimes
pull
a
hair
or
two
out
of
his
eyebrows
or
eyelashes
and
puff
them
away

a
little

sometimes
thrown
on
a

instead
of
a

or

the
shrine
of
the
jungle
mother
in
northern

is
usually
a
pile
of
stones
and

to
which

she

she
saves
them

which
marks
the
spot
where
a

and
to
which
each
contributes
a
stone
is
commonly
in
charge
of
a
baiga
or
aboriginal
priest
who
offers
upon
it
a
cock
a
pig
or
some
spirits
and
occasionally
lights
a
little
lamp
at
the
shrine
amongst
the
baganda
members
of
the
bean
clan
worshipped
the
spirit
of
the
river
nakiza
there
was
no
temple
but
they
had
two
large
heaps
of
sticks
and
grass
one
on
either
side
of
the
river
by
the
ford
to
these
heaps
the
members
went
when
they
wished
to
make
an
offering
to
the
spirit
or
to
seek
his
assistance
the
offerings
were
usually
goats
beer
barkcloth
and
fowls
when
people
crossed
the
river
they
threw
a
little
grass
or
some
sticks
on
to
the
heap
before
crossing
and
again
a
little
more
on
to
the
second
heap
after
crossing
this
was
their
offering
to
the
spirit
for
a

there
is
a
ford
on
the
calabar
river
in
west
africa
which
has
an
ill
repute
for
the
stream
is
broad
the
current
rapid
and
there
are
crocodiles
in
the
deep
places
beside
the
ford
is
a
large
stone
which
the
ekoi
regard
as
an
altar
of
nimm
a
powerful
goddess
who
dwells
in
the
depth
of
the
river
kwa
and
manifests
herself
in
the
likeness
now
of
a
crocodile
and
now
of
a
snake
in
order
to
ensure
a
safe
passage
through
the
river
it
is
customary
to
pluck
a
leaf
rub
it
on
the
forehead
over
the
pineal
gland
and
throw
it
on
a
heap
of
leaves
in
front
of
the
stone
as
he
rubs
the
leaf
on
his
forehead
the
person
who
is
about
to
plunge
into
the
river
prays
may
i
be
free
from
danger
may
i
go
through
the
water
to
the
other
side
may
i
see
no
evil
and
when
he
throws
the
leaf
on
the
heap
he
prays
again
saying
i
am
coming
across
the
river
may
the
crocodile
lay
down
his
head
here
the
leaves
appear
to
be
a
propitiatory
offering
presented
to
the
dread
goddess
in
the
hope
that
she
will
suffer
her
worshipper
to
pass
the
ford
unmolested
at
another
but
smaller
stream
called
the
river
of
good
fortune
the
ekoi
similarly
rub
leaves
on
their
foreheads
praying
for
luck
and
throw
them
on
a
heap
before
they
pass
through
the
water
they
think
that
he
who
complies
with
this
custom
will
have
good
luck
throughout
the
year
again
when
the
ekoi
kill
a
chameleon
on
the
road
they
do
not
throw
the
body
away
in
the
forest
but
lay
it
by
the
wayside
and
all
who
pass
by
pluck
a
few
leaves
and
drop
them
on
the
dead
animal
saying
look
here
is
your
in
this
way
heaps
of
leaves
accumulate
over
the
carcases
of
chameleons
the
custom
is
intended
to
appease
the
shade
of
the
chameleon
who
if
he
were
not
pacified
would
go
to
the
obassi
nsi
and
pray
for
vengeance
on
the
race
of
those
who
had
caused
his
death
the
washamba
of
german
east
africa
believe
that
certain
stony
and
dangerous
places
in
the
paths
are
the
abodes
of
spirits
hence
at
any
such
spot
a
traveller
who
would
have
a
prosperous
journey
must
dance
a
little
and
deposit
a
few
small
stones
the
dance
and
the
stones
are
presumably
intended
to
soften
the
heart
of
the
spirits
and
induce
them
to
look
favourably
on
the

in

westray
one
of
the
orkney
islands
there
is
a
ruined
chapel
called
tredwels
at
the
door
of
which
there
is
a
heap
of
stones
which
was
the
superstition
of
the
common
people
who
have
such
a
veneration
for
this
chapel
above
any
other
that
they
never
fail
at
their
coming
to
it
to
throw
a
stone
as
an
offering
before
the
door
and
this
they
reckon
an
indispensable
duty
enjoined
by
their
prayers
too
as
we
have
seen
are
sometimes
offered
at
these
piles
in
laos
heaps
of
stones

be
seen
beside
the
path
on
which
the
passenger
will
deposit

he
beseeches
the

bestow
on
him

districts

provinces

heaps
of
stones
and
sticks
are
often
to
be
seen
on
hills
or
at
they
are
formed
by
the
contributions
of
passing
travellers
each
of
whom
in
adding
his
stone
or

to
the

prays
saying

mutter
a
prayer
at

they
add

by
them
on

places

may
have
strength

accomplish
it

it
is
said
that
sick
bushmen
used
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
the
cairn
called
the
devil
s
neck
and
pray
to
the
spirit
of
the
place
to
heal
them
while
they
rubbed
the
sick
part
of
their
body
and
cried
woe
woe
on
special
occasions
too
they
resorted
thither
and
implored
the
spirit

help
such
customs
seem
to
indicate
the
gradual
transformation
of
an
old
magical
ceremony
into
a
religious
rite
with
its
characteristic
features
of
prayer
and
sacrifice
yet
behind
these
later
accretions
as
we
may
perhaps
regard
them
it
seems
possible
in
many
if
not
in
all
cases
to
discern
the
nucleus
to
which
they
have
attached
themselves
the
original
idea
which
they
tend
to
conceal
and
in
time
to
transmute
that
idea
is
the
transference
of
evil
from
man
to
a
material
substance
which
he
can
cast
from
him

taking
a
goat
into
the
presence
of
a
sick
man
and
confess
the
sins
of
the
kraal
over
the
animal
sometimes
a
few
drops
of
blood
from
the
sick
man
are
allowed
to
fall
on
the
head
of
the
goat
which
is
turned
out
into
an
uninhabited
part
of
the
veldt
the
sickness
is
supposed
to
be
transferred
to
the
animal
and
to
become
lost
in
the
after
an
illness
a
bechuana
king
seated
himself
upon
an
ox
which
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
the
native
doctor
next
poured
water
on
the
king
s
head
till
it
ran
down
over
his
body
then
the
head
of
the
ox
was
held
in
a
vessel
of
water
till
the
animal
expired
whereupon
the
doctor
declared
and
the
people
believed
that
the
ox
died
of
the
king
s
disease
which
had
been
transferred
from
him
to
it
the
baganda
of
central
africa
also
attempted
to
transfer
illness
from
a
person
to
an
animal
the
would
take
the
animal
pass
some
herbs
over
the
sick
man
tie
these
to
the
animal
and
then
drive
it
away
to
some
waste
land
where
he
would
kill
it
taking
the
meat
as
his
perquisite
the
sick
man
would
be
expected
to
the
akikuyu
of
east
africa
think
that
a
man
can
transfer
the
guilt
of
incest
by
means
of
an
ignoble
ceremony
to
a
goat
which
is
then
killed
this
saves
the
life
of
the
culprit
who
otherwise
must
die
when
disease
breaks
out
among
the
cattle
of
the
bahima
a
pastoral
people
of
central
africa
the
priest
collects
herbs
and
other
remedies
to
attract
the
disease
from
the
cattle
an
animal
is
chosen
from
the
herd
in
the
evening
which
is
to
be
the
scapegoat
for
the
herd
the
herbs
are
tied
round
its
neck
with
certain
fetiches
to
ensure
the
illness
leaving
the
other
animals
the
cow
is
driven
round
the
outside
of
the
kraal
several
times
and
afterwards
placed
inside
with
the
herd
for
the
night
early
the
following
morning
the
animal
is
taken
out
and
again
driven
round
the
kraal
the
priest
then
kills
it
in
the
gateway
and
some
of
the
blood
is
sprinkled
over
the
people
belonging
to
the
kraal
and
also
over
the
herd
the
people
next
file
out
each
one
jumping
over
the
carcase
of
the
cow
and
all
the
animals
are
driven
over
it
in
the
same
way
the
disease
is
thus
transferred
to
the
scapegoat
and
the
herd
is
saved
all
the
fetiches
and
herbs
which
were
upon
the
scapegoat
are
fastened
upon
the
and
lintel
of
the
kraal
to
prevent
the
disease
from
entering
when
the
cattle
of
the
huzuls
a
pastoral
people
of
the
carpathians
are
sick
and
the
owner
attributes
the
sickness
to
witchcraft
he
throws
glowing
coals
into
a
vessel
of
water
and
then
pours
the
water
on
a
black
dog
thus
the
sickness
passes
into
the
dog
and
the
cattle
are
made
whole
in
arabia
when
the
plague
is
raging
the
people
will
sometimes
lead
a
camel
through
all
the
quarters
of
the
town
in
order
that
the
animal
may
take
the
pestilence
on
itself
then
they
strangle
it
in
a
sacred
place
and
imagine
that
they
have
rid
themselves
of
the
camel
and
of
the
plague
at
one
blow
in
annam
when
sickness
is
caused
by
the
presence
of
a
demon
in
the
body
of
the
sufferer
a
skilful
exorcist
will
decoy
the
unwary
devil
into
a
fowl
and
then
quick
as
thought
decapitate
the
bird
and
throw
it
out
of
the
door
but
lest
the
fiend
should
survive
this
severe
operation
cabalistic
figures
are
posted
on
the
outside
of
the
door
which
preclude
him
from
entering
the
premises
and
assaulting
the
patient
afresh
it
is
said
that
when
smallpox
is
raging
the
savages
of
formosa
will
drive
the
demon
of
disease
into
a
sow
then
cut
off
the
animal
s
ears
and
burn
them
or
it
believing
that
in
this
way
they
rid
themselves
of
the
plague
when
a
kabyle
child
is
pining
for
jealousy
of
a
younger
brother
or
sister
the
parents
imagine
that
they
can
cure
it
as
follows
they
take
fifteen
grains
of
wheat
wrap
them
up
in
a
packet
and
leave
the
packet
all
night
under
the
head
of
the
jealous
child
then
in
the
morning
they
throw
the
grains
into
an
saying
salutation
to
you
oh
beautiful
beings
clad
in
black
salutation
to
you
who
dig
the
earth
so
well
without
the
aid
of
any
hoe
by
the
help
of
god
and
the
angels
may
each
of
you
take
his
share
of
the
jealousy
attached
to
these
grains
amongst
the
malagasy
the
vehicle
for
carrying
away
evils
is
called

anything
selected

any
hurtful
evils

anything

counts
upon

all
the
evils

it

where
it

it
is
carried
away

on
the

runs
with

mumbling
as
he
goes

in
the
greatest
rage
against
the
faditra
for
the
evils
it
is
bearing
away
if
it
be
a
pumpkin
it
is
carried
on
the
shoulders
to
a
little
distance
and
there
dashed
upon
the
ground
with
every
appearance
of
fury
and
a
malagasy
was
informed
by
a
diviner
that
he
was
doomed
to
a
bloody
death
but
that
possibly
he
might
avert
his
fate
by
performing
a
certain
rite
carrying
a
small
vessel
full
of
blood
upon
his
head
he
was
to
mount
upon
the
back
of
a
bullock
while
thus
mounted
he
was
to
spill
the
blood
upon
the
bullock
s
head
and
then
send
the
animal
away
into
the
wilderness
whence
it
might
never
return
among
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
a
chief
s
daughter
who
suffered
from
kleptomania
was
healed
by
a
wise
woman
who
placed
a
bag
containing
spiders
and
crabs
on
the
patient
s
hands
the
physician
calculated
that
the
prehensile
claws
of
these
creatures
so
suggestive
of
a
thief
s
hands
in
the
act
of
closing
on
his
prey
would
lay
hold
of
the
vicious
propensity
in
the
young
woman
s
mind
and
extract
it
as
neatly
as
a
pair
of
forceps
nips
out
a
thorn
from
the
flesh
the
battas
of
sumatra
have
a
ceremony
which
they
call
making
the
curse
to
fly
when
a
woman
is
childless
a
sacrifice
is
offered
to
the
gods
of
three
grasshoppers
representing
a
head
of
cattle
a
buffalo
and
a
horse
then
a
swallow
is
set
free
with
a
prayer
that
the
curse
may
fall
upon
the
bird
and
fly
away
with
it
the
entrance
into
a
house
of
an
animal
which
does
not
generally
seek
to
share
the
abode
of
man
is
regarded
by
the
malays
as
ominous
of
misfortune
if
a
wild
bird
flies
into
a
house
it
must
be
carefully
caught
and
smeared
with
oil
and
must
then
be
released
in
the
open
air
a
formula
being
recited
in
which
it
is
bidden
to
fly
away
with
all
the
and
misfortunes
of
the
in
antiquity
greek
women
seem
to
have
done
the
same
with
swallows
which
they
caught
in
the
house
they
poured
oil
on
them
and
let
them
fly
away
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
removing
from
the
household
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
imagine
that
they
can
transfer
freckles
to
the
first
swallow
they
see
in
spring
by
washing
their
face
in
flowing
water
and
saying
swallow
swallow
take
my
freckles
and
give
me
rosy
at
the
cleansing
of
a
leper
and
of
a
house
suspected
of
being
tainted
with
leprosy
among
the
hebrews
the
priest
used
to
let
a
living
bird
fly
away
into
the
open
field
no
doubt
in
order
to
carry
away
the
leprosy
with
it
similarly
among
the
ancient
arabs
a
widow
was
expected
to
live
secluded
in
a
small
tent
for
a
year
after
her
husband
s
death
then
a
bird
or
a
sheep
was
brought
to
her
she
made
the
creature
touch
her
person
and
let
it
go
it
was
believed
that
the
bird
or
the
sheep
would
not
live
long
thereafter
doubtless
it
was
supposed
to
suffer
from
the
uncleanness
or
taint
of
death
which
the
widow
had
transferred
to
it
among
the
majhwar
a
dravidian
race
of
south
mirzapur
if
a
man
has
died
of
a
contagious
disease
such
as
cholera
the
village
priest
walks
in
front
of
the
funeral
procession
with
a
chicken
in
his
hands
which
he
lets
loose
in
the
direction
of
some
other
village
as
a
scapegoat
to
carry
the
infection
away
none
but
another
very
experienced
priest
would
afterwards
dare
to
touch
or
eat
such
a
chicken
among
the
badagas
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
southern
india
when
a
death
has
taken
place
the
sins
of
the
deceased
are
laid
upon
a
buffalo
calf
for
this
purpose
the
people
gather
round
the
corpse
and
carry
it
outside
of
the
village
there
an
elder
of
the
tribe
standing
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
recites
or
chants
a
long
list
of
sins
such
as
any
badaga
may
commit
and
the
people
repeat
the
last
words
of
each
line
after
him
the
confession
of
sins
is
thrice
repeated
by
a
conventional
mode
of
expression
the
sum
total
of
sins
a
man
may
do
is
said
to
be
thirteen
hundred
admitting
that
the
deceased
has
committed
them
all
the
performer
cries
aloud
stay
not
their
flight
to
god
s
pure
as
he
closes
the
whole
assembly
chants
aloud
stay
not
their
again
the
performer
enters
into
details
and
cries
he
killed
the
crawling
snake
it
is
a
in
a
moment
the
last
word
is
caught
up
and
all
the
people
cry
it
is
a
as
they
shout
the
performer
lays
his
hand
upon
the
calf
the
sin
is
transferred
to
the
calf
thus
the
whole
catalogue
is
gone
through
in
this
impressive
way
but
this
is
not
enough
as
the
last
shout
let
all
be
well
dies
away
the
performer
gives
place
to
another
and
again
confession
is
made
and
all
the
people
shout
it
is
a
a
third
time
it
is
done
then
still
in
solemn
silence
the
calf
is
let
loose
like
the
jewish
scapegoat
it
may
never
be
used
for
secular
at
a
badaga
funeral
witnessed
by
the
rev
clayton
the
buffalo
calf
was
led
thrice
round
the
bier
and
the
dead
man
s
hand
was
laid
on
its
head
by
this
act
the
calf
was
supposed
to
receive
all
the
sins
of
the
deceased
it
was
then
driven
away
to
a
great
distance
that
it
might
contaminate
no
one
and
it
was
said
that
it
would
never
be
sold
but
looked
on
as
a
dedicated
sacred
the
idea
of
this
ceremony
is
that
the
sins
of
the
deceased
enter
the
calf
or
that
the
task
of
his
absolution
is
laid
on
it
they
say
that
the
calf
very
soon
disappears
and
that
it
is
never
after
heard
some
of
the
todas
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
like
manner
let
loose
a
calf
as
a
funeral
ceremony
the
intention
may
be
to
transfer
the
sins
of
the
deceased
to
the
animal
perhaps
the
todas
have
borrowed
the
ceremony
from
the
badagas
in
kumaon
a
district
of
india
the
custom
of
letting
loose
a
bullock
as
a
scapegoat
at
a
funeral
is
occasionally
observed
a
bell
is
hung
on
the
bullock
s
neck
and
bells
are
tied
to
its
feet
and
the
animal
is
told
that
it
is
to
be
let
go
in
order
to
save
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
from
the
torments
of
hell
sometimes
the
bullock
s
right
quarter
is
branded
with
a
trident
and
the
left
with
a
discus
perhaps
the
original
intention
of
such
customs
was
to
banish
the
contagion
of
death
by
means
of
the
animal
which
carried
it
away
and
so
ensured
the
life
of
the
survivors
the
idea
of
sin
is
not
primitive
the
transference
to
men
again
men
sometimes
play
the
part
of
scapegoat
by
diverting
to
themselves
the
evils
that
threaten
others
an
ancient
hindoo
ritual
describes
how
the
pangs
of
thirst
may
be
transferred
from
a
sick
man
to
another
the
operator
seats
the
pair
on
branches
back
to
back
the
sufferer
with
his
face
to
the
east
and
the
whole
man
with
his
face
to
the
west
then
he
stirs
some
gruel
in
a
vessel
placed
on
the
patient
s
head
and
hands
the
to
the
other
man
to
drink
in
this
way
he
transfers
the
pangs
of
thirst
from
the
thirsty
soul
to
the
other
who
obligingly
receives
them
in
his
stead
there
is
a
painful
telugu
remedy
for
a
fever
it
is
to
embrace
a
brahman
widow
at
the
earliest
streak
of
dawn
by
doing
so
you
get
rid
of
the
fever
and
no
doubt
though
this
is
not
expressly
affirmed
you
at
the
same
time
transfer
it
to
the
widow
when
a
cinghalese
is
dangerously
ill
and
the
physicians
can
do
nothing
a
is
called
in
who
by
making
offerings
to
the
devils
and
dancing
in
the
masks
appropriate
to
them
conjures
these
demons
of
disease
one
after
the
other
out
of
the
sick
man
s
body
and
into
his
own
having
thus
successfully
extracted
the
cause
of
the
malady
the
artful
dancer
lies
down
on
a
bier
and
shamming
death
is
carried
to
an
open
place
outside
the
village
here
being
left
to
himself
he
soon
comes
to
life
again
and
hastens
back
to
claim
his
reward

of
agnes
sampson

convicted
of
curing
a

upon
him
by
a
westland
warlock
when
he
was
at

she
took
upon
herself
and
kept
the

great
groaning
and
torment

was
a

efforts
to
shift
the
disease
by
means
of
clothes
from
herself
to
a

unfortunately
the
attempt
partly
miscarried
the
disease
missed
the
animal

hit

themselves
the
power

neutralizing
bad
omens
so
when
evil
omens
have
alarmed
a
farmer
for
the
safety
of
his

he
takes
a
small
portion
of
his
farm
produce
to
one
of
these
wise

who
eats
it
raw
for
a
small
consideration

thereby
appropriates
to
himself
the
evil
omen

him
becomes
innocuous

thus
delivers
the

from
the
ban
of

in
one
part
of
new

an
expiation
for
sin
was
felt
to
be
necessary
a
service
was
performed
over
an
individual
by
which
all
the
sins
of
the
tribe
were
supposed
to
be

a

into

the

of
gifts
including

basket
of

his
grateful
country
rewards
his
devotion
by
bestowing
many
privileges
on
him
elsewhere
perhaps
if
we
knew
more
about
the
matter
we
might
find
that
eponymous
magistrates
who
give
their
names
to
the
year
have
been
similarly
regarded
as
public
scapegoats
who
bore
on
their
devoted
heads
the
misfortunes
the
sins
and
the
sorrows
of
the
whole
people
in
the
or
collection
of
indian
stories
which
narrate
the
many
transmigrations
of
the
buddha
there
is
an
instructive
tale
which
sets
forth
how
sins
and
misfortunes
can
be
transferred
by
means
of
spittle
to
a
holy
ascetic
a
lady
of
easy
virtue
we
are
told
had
lost
the
favour
of
king
dandaki
and
bethought
herself
how
she
could
recover
it
as
she
walked
in
the
park
revolving
these
things
in
her
mind
she
spied
a
devout
ascetic
named
kisavaccha
a
thought
struck
her
surely
said
she
to
herself
this
must
be
ill
luck
i
will
get
rid
of
my
sin
on
his
person
and
then
go
and
no
sooner
said
than
done
chewing
her
toothpick
she
collected
a
large
clot
of
spittle
in
her
mouth
with
which
she
beslavered
the
matted
locks
of
the
venerable
man
and
having
hurled
her
toothpick
at
his
head
into
the
bargain
she
departed
with
a
mind
at
peace
and
bathed
the
stratagem
was
entirely
successful
for
the
king
took
her
into
his
good
graces
again
not
long
after
it
chanced
that
the
king
deposed
his
domestic
chaplain
from
his
office
naturally
chagrined
at
this
loss
of
royal
favour
the
clergyman
repaired
to
the
king
s
light
o
love
and
enquired
how
she
had
contrived
to
recapture
the
monarch
s
affection
she
told
him
frankly
how
she
had
got
rid
of
her
sin
and
emerged
without
a
stain
on
her
character
by
simply
spitting
on
the
head
of
ill
luck
in
the
royal
park
the
chaplain
took
the
hint
and
hastening
to
the
park
bespattered
in
like
manner
the
sacred
locks
of
the
holy
man
and
in
consequence
he
was
soon
reinstated
in
office
it
would
have
been
well
if
the
thing
had
stopped
there
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
by
and
bye
it
happened
that
there
was
a
disturbance
on
the
king
s
frontier
and
the
king
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
army
to
go
forth
and
fight
an
unhappy
idea
occurred
to
his
domestic
chaplain
elated
by
the
success
of
the
expedient
which
had
restored
him
to
royal
favour
he
asked
the
king
sire
do
you
wish
for
victory
or
defeat
why
for
victory
of
course
replied
the
king
then
you
take
my
advice
said
the
chaplain
just
go
and
spit
on
the
head
of
ill
luck
who
dwells
in
the
royal
park
you
will
thus
transfer
all
your
sin
to
his
it
seemed
to
the
king
a
capital
idea
and
he
improved
on
it
by
proposing
that
the
whole
army
should
accompany
him
and
get
rid
of
their
sins
in
like
manner
they
all
did
so
beginning
with
the
king
and
the
state
of
the
holy
man
s
head
when
they
had
all
done
is
something
frightful
to
contemplate
but
even
this
was
not
the
worst
for
after
the
king
had
gone
up
came
the
and
seeing
the
sad
plight
of
the
pious
ascetic
he
took
pity
on
him
and
had
his
poor
bedabbled
hair
thoroughly
washed
the
fatal
consequences
of
this
but
most
injudicious
shampoo
may
easily
be
anticipated
the
sins
which
had
been
transferred
with
the
saliva
to
the
person
of
the
devotee
were
now
restored
to
their
respective
owners
and
to
punish
them
for
their
guilt
fire
fell
from
heaven
and
destroyed
the
whole
kingdom
for
sixty
leagues
round
about
a
less
harmless
way
of
relieving
an
army
from
guilt
or
misfortune
used
in
former
times
to
be
actually
practised
by
the
baganda
when
an
army
had
returned
from
war
and
the
gods
warned
the
king
by
their
oracles
that
some
evil
had
attached
itself
to
the
soldiers
it
was
customary
to
pick
out
a
woman
slave
from
the
captives
together
with
a
cow
a
goat
a
fowl
and
a
dog
from
the
booty
and
to
send
them
back
under
a
strong
guard
to
the
borders
of
the
country
from
which
they
had
come
there
their
limbs
were
broken
and
they
were
left
to
die
for
they
were
too
crippled
to
crawl
back
to
uganda
in
order
to
ensure
the
transference
of
the
evil
to
these
substitutes
bunches
of
grass
were
rubbed
over
the
people
and
cattle
and
then
tied
to
the
victims
after
that
the
army
was
pronounced
clean
and
was
allowed
to
return
to
the
capital
a
similar
mode
of
transferring
evil
to
human
and
animal
victims
was
practised
by
the
baganda
whenever
the
gods
warned
the
king
that
his
hereditary
foes
the
banyoro
were
working
magic
against
him
and
his
people
in
travancore
when
a
rajah
is
near
his
end
they
seek
out
a
holy
brahman
who
consents
to
take
upon
himself
the
sins
of
the
dying
man
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
rupees
thus
prepared
to
immolate
himself
on
the
altar
of
duty
as
a
vicarious
sacrifice
for
sin
the
saint
is
introduced
into
the
chamber
of
death
and
closely
embraces
the
dying
rajah
saying
to
him
o
king
i
undertake
to
bear
all
your
sins
and
diseases
may
your
highness
live
long
and
reign
having
thus
with
a
noble
devotion
taken
to
himself
the
sins
of
the
sufferer
and
likewise
the
rupees
he
is
sent
away
from
the
country
and
never
more
allowed
to
return
closely
akin
to
this
is
the
old
welsh
custom
known
as
according
to
aubrey
in
the
county
of
hereford
was
an
old
custome
at
funeralls
to
hire
poor
people
who
were
to
take
upon
them
all
the
sinnes
of
the
party
deceased
one
of
them
i
remember
lived
in
a
cottage
on
way
he
was
a
long
leane
ugly
lamentable
poor
raskal
the
manner
was
that
when
the
corps
was
brought
out
of
the
house
and
layd
on
the
biere
a
loafe
of
bread
was
brought
out
and
delivered
to
the
over
the
corps
as
also
a
of
maple
gossips
bowle
full
of
beer
which
he
was
to
drinke
up
and
sixpence
in
money
in
consideration
whereof
he
took
upon
him
ipso
facto
all
the
sinnes
of
the
defunct
and
freed
him
or
her
from
walking
after
they
were
dead
this
custome
though
rarely
used
in
our
dayes
yet
by
some
people
was
observed
even
in
the
strictest
time
of
ye
presbyterian
government
as
at
dynder
volens
nolens
the
parson
of
ye
parish
the
kinred
of
a
woman
deceased
there
had
this
ceremonie
punctually
performed
according
to
her
will
and
also
the
like
was
donne
at
ye
city
of
hereford
in
these
times
when
a
woman
kept
many
yeares
before
her
death
a
for
the
and
the
like
in
other
places
in
this
countie
as
also
in
brecon
at
llangors
where
gwin
the
minister
about
could
no
hinder
ye
performing
of
this
ancient
custome
i
believe
this
custom
was
heretofore
used
over
all
wales
in
north
wales
the
are
frequently
made
use
of
but
there
instead
of
a
bowle
of
beere
they
have
a
bowle
of
according
to
a
letter
dated
february
within
the
memory
of
our
fathers
in
shropshire
in
those
villages
adjoyning
to
wales
when
a
person
dyed
there
was
notice
given
to
an
old
sire
for
so
they
called
him
who
presently
repaired
to
the
place
where
the
deceased
lay
and
stood
before
the
door
of
the
house
when
some
of
the
family
came
out
and
furnished
him
with
a
cricket
on
which
he
sat
down
facing
the
door
then
they
gave
him
a
groat
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
a
crust
of
bread
which
he
eat
and
a
full
bowle
of
ale
which
he
drank
off
at
a
draught
after
this
he
got
up
from
the
cricket
and
pronounced
with
a
composed
gesture
the
ease
and
rest
of
the
soul
departed
for
which
he
would
pawn
his
own
soul
this
i
had
from
the
ingenious
john
aubrey
in
modern
times
some
doubt
has
been
thrown
on
aubrey
s
account
of
the
custom
the
practice
however
is
reported
to
have
prevailed
in
a
valley
not
far
from
llandebie
to
a
recent
period
an
instance
was
said
to
have
occurred
about
sixty
years
ago
aubrey
s
statement
is
moreover
supported
by
the
analogy
of
similar
customs
in
india
when
the
rajah
of
tanjore
died
in
some
of
his
bones
and
the
bones
of
the
two
wives
who
were
burned
with
his
corpse
were
ground
to
powder
and
eaten
mixed
with
boiled
rice
by
twelve
brahmans
it
was
believed
that
the
sins
of
the
deceased
passed
into
the
bodies
of
the
brahmans
who
were
paid
for
the
service
a
brahman
resident
in
a
village
near
raipur
stated
that
he
had
eaten
food
rice
and
milk
out
of
the
hand
of
the
dead
rajah
of
bilaspur
and
that
in
consequence
he
had
been
placed
on
the
throne
for
the
space
of
a
year
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
had
been
given
presents
and
then
turned
out
of
the
territory
and
forbidden
apparently
to
return
he
was
an
outcast
among
his
fellows
for
having
eaten
out
of
a
dead
man
s
hand
a
similar
custom
is
believed
to
obtain
in
the
hill
states
about
kangra
and
to
have
given
rise
to
a
caste
of
outcaste
brahmans
at
the
funeral
of
a
rani
of
chamba
rice
and
ghee
were
eaten
out
of
the
hands
of
the
corpse
by
a
brahman
paid
for
the
purpose
afterwards
a
stranger
who
had
been
caught
outside
the
chamba
territory
was
given
the
costly
wrappings
of
the
corpse
then
told
to
depart
and
never
shew
his
face
in
the
country
again
in
oude
when
an
infant
was
killed
it
used
to
be
buried
in
the
room
where
it
had
been
born
on
the
thirteenth
day
afterwards
the
priest
had
to
cook
and
eat
his
food
in
that
room
by
doing
so
he
was
supposed
to
take
the
whole
sin
upon
himself
and
to
cleanse
the
family
from
it
at
utch
kurgan
in
turkestan
schuyler
saw
an
old
man
who
was
said
to
get
his
living
by
taking
on
himself
the
sins
of
the
dead
and
thenceforth
devoting
his
life
to
prayer
for
their
souls
in
tahiti
where
the
bodies
of
chiefs
and
persons
of
rank
were
embalmed
and
preserved
above
ground
in
special
sheds
or
houses
erected
for
them
a
priest
was
employed
at
the
funeral
rites
who
bore
the
title
of
the
his
office
was
singular
when
the
house
for
the
dead
had
been
prepared
and
the
corpse
placed
on
the
platform
or
bier
the
priest
ordered
a
hole
to
be
made
in
the
floor
near
the
foot
of
the
platform
over
this
he
prayed
to
the
god
by
whom
it
was
supposed
that
the
soul
of
the
deceased
had
been
called
away
the
purport
of
his
prayer
was
that
all
the
dead
man
s
sins
especially
the
one
for
which
his
soul
had
been
required
of
him
might
be
deposited
there
that
they
might
not
attach
in
any
degree
to
the
survivors
and
that
the
anger
of
the
god
might
be
appeased
he
next
addressed
the
corpse
usually
saying
with
you
let
the
guilt
now
the
pillar
or
post
of
the
corpse
as
it
was
called
was
then
planted
in
the
hole
and
the
hole
filled
up
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
of
depositing
the
sins
in
the
hole
was
over
all
who
had
touched
the
body
or
the
garments
of
the
deceased
which
were
buried
or
destroyed
fled
precipitately
into
the
sea
to
cleanse
themselves
from
the
pollution
which
they
had
contracted
by
touching
the
corpse
they
also
cast
into
the
sea
the
garments
they
had
worn
while
they
were
performing
the
last
offices
to
the
dead
having
finished
their
ablutions
they
gathered
a
few
pieces
of
coral
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
returning
with
them
to
the
house
addressed
the
corpse
saying
with
you
may
the
pollution
so
saying
they
threw
down
the
coral
on
the
top
of
the
hole
which
had
been
dug
to
receive
the
sins
and
the
defilement
of
the
dead
in
this
instance
the
sins
of
the
departed
as
well
as
the
pollution
which
the
primitive
mind
commonly
associates
with
death
are
not
borne
by
a
living
person
but
buried
in
a
hole
yet
the
fundamental
of
the
transference
of
the
same
in
the
tahitian
as
in
the
welsh
and
indian
customs
whether
the
vehicle
or
receptacle
destined
to
catch
and
draw
off
the
evil

a
person
an
animal
or
a
thing

for
the
purpose

a
matter
of
little
moment
the
transference
of
evil
in
europe
the
examples
of
the
transference
of
evil
hitherto
adduced
have
been
mostly
drawn
from
the
customs
of
savage
or
barbarous
peoples
but
similar
attempts
to
shift
the
burden
of
disease
misfortune
and
sin
from
one
s
self
to
another
person
or
to
an
animal
or
thing
have
been
common
also
among
the
civilized
nations
of
europe
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
a
roman
cure
for
fever
was
to
pare
the
patient
s
nails
and
stick
the
parings
with
wax
on
a
neighbour
s
door
before
sunrise
the
fever
then
passed
from
the
sick
man
to
his
neighbour
similar
devices
must
have
been
resorted
to
by
the
greeks
for
in
laying
down
laws
for
his
ideal
state
plato
thinks
it
too
much
to
expect
that
men
should
not
be
alarmed
at
finding
certain
wax
figures
adhering
to
their
doors
or
to
the
tombstones
of
their
parents
or
lying
at
among
the
ruins
of
the
great
sanctuary
of
aesculapius
which
were
excavated
not
very
long
ago
in
an
open
valley
among
the
mountains
of
epidaurus
inscriptions
have
been
found
recording
the
miraculous
cures
which
the
god
of
healing
performed
for
his
faithful
worshippers
one
of
them
tells
how
a
certain
pandarus
a
thessalian
was
freed
from
the
letters
which
as
a
former
slave
or
prisoner
of
war
he
bore
tattooed
or
branded
on
his
brow
he
slept
in
the
sanctuary
with
a
fillet
round
his
head
and
in
the
morning
he
discovered
to
his
joy
that
the
marks
of
blue
or
scarlet
been
transferred
from
his
brow
to
the
fillet
by
and
by
there
came
to
the
sanctuary
a
wicked
man
also
with
brands
or
tattoo
marks
on
his
face
who
had
been
charged
by
pandarus
to
pay
his
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
god
and
had
received
the
cash
for
the
purpose
but
the
cunning
fellow
thought
to
cheat
the
god
and
keep
the
money
all
to
himself
so
when
the
god
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
asked
anxiously
after
the
money
he
boldly
denied
that
he
had
it
and
impudently
prayed
the
god
to
remove
the
ugly
marks
from
his
own
brazen
brow
he
was
told
to
tie
the
fillet
of
pandarus
about
his
head
then
to
take
it
off
and
look
at
his
face
in
the
water
of
the
sacred
well
he
did
so
and
sure
enough
he
saw
on
his
forehead
the
marks
of
pandarus
in
addition
to
his
own
in
the
fourth
century
of
our
era
marcellus
of
bordeaux
prescribed
a
cure
for
warts
which
has
still
a
great
vogue
among
the
superstitious
in
various
parts
of
europe
doubtless
it
was
an
old
traditional
remedy
in
the
fourth
and
will
long
survive
the
expiry
of
the
twentieth
century
you
are
to
touch
your
warts
with
as
many
little
stones
as
you
have
warts
then
wrap
the
stones
in
an
ivy
leaf
and
throw
them
away
in
a
thoroughfare
whoever
picks
them
up
will
get
the
warts
and
you
will
be
rid
of
them
a
similar
cure
for
warts
with
such
trifling
variations
as
the
substitution
of
peas
or
barley
for
pebbles
and
a
rag
or
a
piece
of
paper
for
an
ivy
leaf
has
been
prescribed
in
modern
times
in
italy
france
austria
england
and
scotland
another
favourite
way
of
passing
on
your
warts
to
somebody
else
is
to
make
as
many
knots
in
a
string
as
you
have
warts
then
throw
the
string
away
or
place
it
under
a
stone
whoever
treads
on
the
stone
or
picks
up
the
thread
will
get
the
warts
instead
of
you
sometimes
to
complete
the
transference
it
is
thought
necessary
that
he
should
undo
the
knots
or
you
need
only
place
the
knotted
thread
before
sunrise
in
the
spout
of
a
pump
the
next
person
who
works
the
pump
will
be
sure
to
get
your
warts
equally
effective
methods
are
to
rub
the
troublesome
excrescences
with
down
or
fat
or
to
bleed
them
on
a
rag
and
then
throw
away
the
down
the
fat
or
the
bloody
rag
the
person
who
picks
up
one
or
other
of
these
things
will
be
sure
to
release
you
from
your
warts
by
involuntarily
transferring
them
to
himself
people
in
the
orkney
islands
will
sometimes
wash
a
sick
man
and
then
throw
the
water
down
at
a
gateway
in
the
belief
that
the
sickness
will
leave
the
patient
and
be
transferred
to
the
first
person
who
passes
through
the
gate
a
bavarian
cure
for
fever
is
to
write
upon
a
piece
of
paper
fever
stay
away
i
am
not
at
home
and
to
put
the
paper
in
somebody
s
pocket
the
latter
then
catches
the
fever
and
the
patient
is
rid
of
it
or
the
sufferer
may
cure
himself
by
sticking
a
twig
of
the
in
the
ground
without
speaking
the
fever
then
adheres
to
the
twig
and
whoever
pulls
up
the
twig
will
catch
the
disease
a
bohemian
prescription
for
the
same
malady
is
this
take
an
empty
pot
go
with
it
to
a
throw
it
down
and
run
away
the
first
person
who
kicks
against
the
pot
will
catch
your
fever
and
you
will
be
cured
in
oldenburg
they
say
that
when
a
person
lies
sweating
with
fever
he
should
take
a
piece
of
money
to
himself
in
bed
the
money
is
afterwards
thrown
away
on
the
street
and
whoever
picks
it
up
will
catch
the
fever
but
the
original
patient
will
be
rid
of
it
often
in
europe
as
among
savages
an
attempt
is
made
to
transfer
a
pain
or
malady
from
a
man
to
an
animal
grave
writers
of
antiquity
recommended
that
if
a
man
be
stung
by
a
scorpion
he
should
sit
upon
an
ass
with
his
face
to
the
tail
or
whisper
in
the
animal
s
ear
a
scorpion
has
stung
me
in
either
case
they
thought
the
pain
would
be
transferred
from
the
man
to
the
ass
many
cures
of
this
sort
are
recorded
by
marcellus
for
example
he
tells
us
that
the
following
is
a
remedy
for
toothache
standing
booted
under
the
open
sky
on
the
ground
you
catch
a
frog
by
the
head
spit
into
its
mouth
ask
it
to
carry
away
the
ache
and
then
let
it
go
but
the
ceremony
must
be
performed
on
a
lucky
day
and
at
a
lucky
hour
in
cheshire
the
ailment
known
as
aphtha
or
thrush
which
affects
the
mouth
or
throat
of
infants
is
not
uncommonly
treated
in
much
the
same
manner
a
young
frog
is
held
for
a
few
moments
with
its
head
inside
the
mouth
of
the
sufferer
whom
it
is
supposed
to
relieve
by
taking
the
malady
to
itself
i
assure
you
said
an
old
woman
who
had
often
superintended
such
a
cure
we
used
to
hear
the
poor
frog
whooping
and
coughing
mortal
bad
for
days
after
it
would
have
made
your
heart
ache
to
hear
the
poor
creature
coughing
as
it
did
about
the
again
marcellus
tells
us
that
if
the
foam
from
a
mule
s
mouth
mixed
with
warm
water
be
drunk
by
an
asthmatic
patient
he
will
at
once
recover
but
the
mule
will
die
an
ancient
cure
for
the
gripes
recorded
both
by
pliny
and
marcellus
was
to
put
a
live
duck
to
the
belly
of
the
sufferer
the
pains
passed
from
the
man
into
the
bird
to
which
they
proved
fatal
according
to
the
same
writers
a
stomachic
complaint
of
which
the
cause
was
unknown
might
be
cured
by
applying
a
blind
puppy
to
the
suffering
part
for
three
days
the
secret
disorder
thus
passed
into
the
puppy
it
died
and
a
examination
of
its
little
body
revealed
the
cause
of
the
disease
from
which
the
man
had
suffered
and
of
which
the
dog
had
died
once
more
marcellus
advises
that
when
a
man
was
afflicted
with
a
disorder
of
the
intestines
the
physician
should
catch
a
live
hare
take
the
from
one
of
its
feet
and
the
down
from
the
belly
then
let
the
hare
go
pronouncing
as
he
did
so
the
words
run
away
run
away
little
hare
and
take
away
with
you
the
intestine
further
the
doctor
was
to
fashion
the
down
into
thread
with
which
he
was
to
tie
the
to
the
patient
s
body
taking
great
care
that
the
thread
should
not
be
touched
by
any
woman
a
northamptonshire
devonshire
and
welsh
cure
for
a
cough
is
to
put
a
hair
of
the
patient
s
head
between
two
slices
of
buttered
bread
and
give
the
sandwich
to
a
dog
the
animal
will
thereupon
catch
the
cough
and
the
patient
will
lose
it
sometimes
an
ailment
is
transferred
to
an
animal
by
sharing
food
with
it
thus
in
oldenburg
if
you
are
sick
of
a
fever
you
set
a
bowl
of
sweet
milk
before
a
dog
and
say
good
luck
you
hound
may
you
be
sick
and
i
be
sound
then
when
the
dog
has
lapped
some
of
the
milk
you
take
a
swig
at
the
bowl
and
then
the
dog
must
lap
again
and
then
you
must
swig
again
and
when
you
and
the
dog
have
done
it
the
third
time
he
will
have
the
fever
and
you
will
be
quit
of
it
a
peasant
woman
in
abbehausen
told
her
pastor
that
she
suffered
from
fever
for
a
whole
year
and
found
no
relief
at
last
somebody
advised
her
to
give
some
of
her
food
to
a
dog
and
a
cat
she
did
so
and
the
fever
passed
from
her
into
the
animals
but
when
she
saw
the
poor
sick
beasts
always
before
her
she
wished
it
undone
then
the
fever
left
the
cat
and
the
dog
and
returned
to
her
a
bohemian
cure
for
fever
is
to
go
out
into
the
forest
before
the
sun
is
up
and
look
for
a
snipe
s
nest
when
you
have
found
it
take
out
one
of
the
young
birds
and
keep
it
beside
you
for
three
days
then
go
back
into
the
wood
and
set
the
snipe
free
the
fever
will
leave
you
at
once
the
snipe
has
taken
it
away
so
in
vedic
times
the
hindoos
of
old
sent
consumption
away
with
a
blue
jay
they
said
o
consumption
fly
away
fly
away
with
the
blue
jay
with
the
wild
rush
of
the
storm
and
the
whirlwind
oh
vanish
away
in
oldenburg
they
sometimes
hang
up
a
goldfinch
or
a
in
the
room
of
a
consumptive
patient
hoping
that
the
bird
may
draw
away
the
malady
from
the
sufferer
to
itself
a
prescription
for
a
cough
in
sunderland
is
to
shave
the
patient
s
head
and
hang
the
hair
on
a
bush
when
the
birds
carry
the
hair
to
their
nests
they
will
carry
the
cough
with
it
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
a
cure
for
headache
is
to
tie
a
thread
thrice
round
your
head
and
then
hang
it
in
a
loop
from
a
tree
if
a
bird
flies
through
the
loop
it
will
take
your
headache
away
with
it
a
saxon
remedy
for
rupture
in
a
child
is
to
take
a
snail
thrust
it
at
sunset
into
a
hollow
tree
and
stop
up
the
hole
with
clay
then
as
the
snail
perishes
the
child
recovers
but
this
cure
must
be
accompanied
by
the
recitation
of
a
proper
form
of
words
otherwise
it
has
no
effect
a
bohemian
remedy
for
jaundice
is
as
follows
take
a
living
tench
tie
it
to
your
bare
back
and
carry
it
about
with
you
for
a
whole
day
the
tench
will
turn
quite
yellow
and
die
then
throw
it
into
running
water
and
your
jaundice
will
depart
with
it
in
the
village
of
llandegla
in
wales
there
is
a
church
dedicated
to
the
virgin
martyr
tecla
where
the
falling
sickness
is
or
used
to
be
cured
by
being
transferred
to
a
fowl
the
patient
first
washed
his
limbs
in
a
sacred
well
hard
by
dropped
fourpence
into
it
as
an
offering
walked
thrice
round
the
well
and
thrice
repeated
the
lord
s
prayer
then
the
fowl
which
was
a
cock
or
a
hen
according
as
the
patient
was
a
man
or
a
woman
was
put
into
a
basket
and
carried
round
first
the
well
and
afterwards
the
church
next
the
sufferer
entered
the
church
and
lay
down
under
the
communion
table
till
break
of
day
after
that
he
offered
sixpence
and
departed
leaving
the
fowl
in
the
church
if
the
bird
died
the
sickness
was
supposed
to
have
been
transferred
to
it
from
the
man
or
woman
who
was
now
rid
of
the
disorder
as
late
as
the
old
parish
clerk
of
the
village
remembered
quite
well
to
have
seen
the
birds
staggering
about
from
the
effects
of
the
fits
which
had
been
transferred
to
them
in
south
glamorgan
and
west
pembrokeshire
it
is
thought
possible
to
get
rid
of
warts
by
means
of
a
snail
you
take
a
snail
with
a
black
shell
you
rub
it
on
each
wart
and
say
wart
on
the
snail
s
shell
black
away
soon
and
never
come
then
you
put
the
snail
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
bramble
and
you
nail
it
down
with
as
many
thorns
as
you
have
warts
when
the
snail
has
rotted
away
on
the
bough
your
warts
will
have
vanished
another
welsh
cure
for
warts
is
to
impale
a
frog
on
a
stick
and
then
to
rub
the
warts
on
the
creature
the
warts
disappear
as
the
frog
expires
in
both
these
cases
we
may
assume
that
the
warts
are
transferred
from
the
human
sufferer
to
the
suffering
animal
often
the
sufferer
seeks
to
shift
his
burden
of
sickness
or
to
some
inanimate
object
in
athens
there
is
a
little
chapel
of
john
the
baptist
built
against
an
ancient
column
fever
patients
resort
thither
and
by
attaching
a
waxed
thread
to
the
inner
side
of
the
column
believe
that
they
transfer
the
fever
from
themselves
to
the
pillar
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
they
say
that
if
you
suffer
from
giddiness
you
should
strip
yourself
naked
and
run
thrice
round
a
after
sunset
in
that
way
the
flax
will
get
the
giddiness
and
you
will
be
rid
of
it
sometimes
an
attempt
is
made
to
transfer
the
mischief
whatever
it
may
be
to
the
moon
in
oldenburg
a
peasant
related
how
he
rid
himself
of
a
bony
excrescence
by
stroking
it
thrice
crosswise
in
the
name
of
the
trinity
and
then
making
a
gesture
as
if
he
were
seizing
the
deformity
and
hurling
it
towards
the
moon
in
the
same
part
of
germany
a
cure
for
warts
is
to
stand
in
the
light
of
a
waxing
moon
so
that
you
can
not
see
your
own
shadow
then
hold
the
disfigured
hand
towards
the
moon
and
stroke
it
with
the
other
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
luminary
some
say
that
in
doing
this
you
should
pronounce
these
words
moon
free
me
from
these
but
perhaps
the
thing
most
commonly
employed
in
europe
as
a
receptacle
for
sickness
and
trouble
of
all
sorts
is
a
tree
or
bush
the
modes
of
transferring
the
mischief
to
it
are
many
for
example
the
esthonians
say
that
you
ought
not
to
go
out
of
the
house
on
a
spring
morning
before
you
have
eaten
or
drunk
for
if
you
do
you
may
chance
to
hear
one
of
the
sounds
which
are
not
heard
in
winter
such
as
the
song
of
a
bird
and
that
would
be
unlucky
they
think
that
if
you
thus
let
yourself
be
deceived
or
outwitted
as
they
call
it
by
a
bird
you
will
be
visited
by
all
sorts
of
during
the
year
indeed
it
may
very
well
happen
that
you
will
fall
sick
and
die
before
another
spring
comes
round
however
there
is
a
way
of
averting
the
evil
you
have
merely
to
embrace
a
tree
or
go
thrice
round
it
biting
into
the
bark
each
time
or
tearing
away
a
strip
of
the
bark
with
your
teeth
thus
the
bad
luck
passes
from
you
to
the
tree
which
accordingly
withers
away
in
sicily
it
is
believed
that
all
kinds
of
marvellous
cures
can
be
effected
on
the
night
which
precedes
ascension
day
for
example
people
who
suffer
from
goitre
bite
the
bark
of
a
just
at
the
moment
when
the
clocks
are
striking
midnight
thus
the
malady
is
transferred
to
the
sap
of
the
tree
and
its
leaves
wither
away
in
exact
proportion
as
the
patient
recovers
but
in
order
that
the
cure
may
be
successful
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
the
bark
should
be
bitten
at
midnight
precisely
a
bite
before
or
after
that
witching
hour

they
turn
once
more
towards
the
tree
and
call
out
i
leave
you
my
laziness
and
the
same
people
attempt
to
cure
fever
by
transferring
it
to
a
dwarf
having
found
such
a
bush
with
three
shoots
springing
from
the
root
the
patient
grasps
the
points
of
the
three
shoots
in
his
hand
bends
them
down
to
the
ground
and
fastens
them
there
with
a
stone
under
the
arch
thus
formed
he
creeps
thrice
then
he
cuts
off
or
digs
up
the
three
shoots
saying
in
three
shoots
i
cut
three
sicknesses
out
when
these
three
shoots
grow
young
again
may
the
fever
come
a
bulgarian
cure
for
fever
is
to
run
thrice
round
a
at
sunrise
crying
the
fever
shall
shake
thee
and
the
sun
shall
warm
in
the
greek
island
of
karpathos
the
priest
ties
a
red
thread
round
the
neck
of
a
sick
person
next
morning
the
friends
of
the
patient
remove
the
thread
and
go
out
to
the
hillside
where
they
tie
the
thread
to
a
tree
thinking
that
they
thus
transfer
the
sickness
to
the
tree
italians
attempt
to
cure
fever
in
like
manner
by
fastening
it
to
a
tree
the
sufferer
ties
a
thread
round
his
left
wrist
at
night
and
hangs
the
thread
on
a
tree
next
morning
the
fever
is
thus
believed
to
be
tied
up
to
the
tree
and
the
patient
to
be
rid
of
it
but
he
must
be
careful
not
to
pass
by
that
tree
again
otherwise
the
fever
would
break
loose
from
its
bonds
and
attack
him
afresh
an
old
french
remedy
for
fever
was
to
bind
the
patient
himself
to
a
tree
and
leave
him
there
for
a
time
some
said
that
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
fasting
and
early
in
the
morning
that
the
cord
or
straw
rope
with
which
the
person
was
bound
to
the
tree
should
be
left
there
to
rot
and
that
the
sufferer
should
bite
the
bark
of
the
tree
before
returning
home
in
bohemia
the
friends
of
a
fever
patient
will
sometimes
carry
him
head
foremost
by
means
of
straw
ropes
to
a
bush
on
which
they
dump
him
down
then
he
must
jump
up
and
run
home
the
friends
who
carried
him
also
flee
leaving
the
straw
ropes
and
likewise
the
fever
behind
them
on
the
bush
sometimes
the
sickness
is
transferred
to
the
tree
by
making
a
knot
in
one
of
its
boughs
thus
in
mecklenburg
a
remedy
for
fever
is
to
go
before
sunrise
to
a
and
tie
as
many
knots
in
one
of
its
branches
as
the
fever
has
lasted
days
but
going
and
coming
you
must
be
careful
not
to
speak
a
word
a
flemish
cure
for
the
ague
is
to
go
early
in
the
morning
to
an
old
willow
tie
three
knots
in
one
of
its
branches
say
old
one
i
give
thee
the
cold
old
one
then
turn
and
run
away
without
looking
round
in
rhenish
bavaria
the
cure
for
gout
is
similar
the
patient
recites
a
spell
or
prayer
while
he
stands
at
a
holding
one
of
its
boughs
when
the
mystic
words
have
been
spoken
he
ties
a
knot
in
the
bough
and
departs
cured
but
all
his
life
long
he
must
never
go
near
that
again
or
the
gout
will
come
back
to
him
in
sonnenberg
if
you
would
rid
yourself
of
gout
you
should
go
to
a
young
and
tie
a
knot
in
one
of
its
twigs
saying
god
greet
thee
noble
fir
i
bring
thee
my
gout
here
will
i
tie
a
knot
and
bind
my
gout
into
it
in
the
name
etc
not
far
from
marburg
at
a
place
called
neuhof
there
is
a
wood
of
birches
thither
on
a
morning
before
sunrise
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
moon
bands
of
gouty
people
may
often
be
seen
hobbling
in
silence
each
of
them
takes
his
stand
before
a
separate
tree
and
pronounces
these
solemn
words
here
stand
i
before
the
judgment
bar
of
god
and
tie
up
all
my
gout
all
the
disease
in
my
body
shall
remain
tied
up
in
this
meanwhile
the
good
physician
ties
a
knot
in
a
repeating
thrice
in
the
name
of
the
father
etc
another
way
of
transferring
gout
from
a
man
to
a
tree
is
this
pare
the
nails
of
the
sufferer
s
fingers
and
clip
some
hairs
from
his
legs
bore
a
hole
in
an
oak
stuff
the
nails
and
hair
in
the
hole
stop
up
the
hole
again
and
smear
it
with
cow
s
dung
if
for
three
months
thereafter
the
patient
is
free
of
gout
you
may
be
sure
the
oak
has
it
in
his
stead
a
german
cure
for
toothache
is
to
bore
a
hole
in
a
tree
and
cram
some
of
the
sufferer
s
hair
into
it
in
these
cases
though
no
doubt
the
tree
suffers
the
pangs
of
gout
or
toothache
respectively
it
does
so
with
a
sort
of
stoical
equanimity
giving
no
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
pains
that
rack
it
inwardly
it
is
not
always
so
however
the
tree
can
not
invariably
suppress
every
symptom
of
its
suffering
it
may
hide
its
toothache
but
it
can
not
so
easily
hide
its
warts
in
cheshire
if
you
would
be
rid
of
warts
you
have
only
to
rub
them
with
a
piece
of
bacon
cut
a
slit
in
the
bark
of
an
and
slip
the
bacon
under
the
bark
soon
the
warts
will
disappear
from
your
hand
only
however
to
reappear
in
the
shape
of
rough
excrescences
or
knobs
on
the
bark
of
the
tree
again
in
beauce
and
perche
two
provinces
of
france
fever
may
be
transferred
to
a
young
aspen
by
inserting
the
parings
of
the
patient
s
nails
in
the
tree
and
then
plastering
up
the
hole
to
prevent
the
fever
from
getting
out
but
the
operation
must
be
performed
by
night
how
subject
an
aspen
is
to
fever
must
be
obvious
to
the
meanest
capacity
from
the
trembling
of
its
leaves
in
every
breath
of
wind
nothing
therefore
can
be
easier
or
more
natural
than
to
transfer
the
malady
with
its
fits
of
shaking
to
the
tree
at
berkhampstead
in
hertfordshire
there
used
to
be
certain
which
were
long
celebrated
for
the
cure
of
ague
the
transference
of
the
malady
to
the
tree
was
simple
but
painful
a
lock
of
the
sufferer
s
hair
was
pegged
into
an
oak
then
by
a
sudden
wrench
he
left
his
hair
and
his
ague
behind
him
in
the
tree
it
seems
clear
that
though
you
may
stow
away
your
pain
or
sickness
in
a
tree
there
is
a
considerable
risk
of
its
coming
out
again
to
obviate
this
danger
common
prudence
suggests
that
you
should
plug
or
bung
up
the
hole
as
tight
as
you
can
and
this
as
we
should
naturally
expect
is
often
done
a
german
cure
for
toothache
or
headache
is
to
wrap
some
of
the
sufferer
s
cut
hair
and
nails
in
paper
make
a
hole
in
the
tree
stuff
the
parcel
into
it
and
stop
up
the
hole
with
a
plug
made
from
a
tree
which
has
been
struck
by
lightning
in
bohemia
they
say
that
if
you
feel
the
fever
coming
on
you
should
pull
out
some
of
your
hair
tear
off
a
strip
of
a
garment
you
are
wearing
and
bore
a
hole
in
a
having
done
so
you
put
the
hair
and
the
rag
in
the
hole
and
stop
it
up
with
a
wedge
of
hawthorn
then
go
home
without
looking
back
and
if
a
voice
calls
to
you
be
sure
not
to
answer
when
you
have
complied
with
this
prescription
the
fever
will
cease
in
oldenburg
a
common
remedy
for
fever
is
to
bore
a
hole
in
a
tree
breathe
thrice
into
the
hole
and
then
plug
it
up
once
a
man
who
had
thus
shut
up
his
fever
in
a
tree
was
jeered
at
by
a
sceptical
acquaintance
for
his
credulity
so
he
went
secretly
to
the
tree
and
drew
the
stopper
and
out
came
that
fever
and
attacked
the
sceptic
sometimes
they
say
that
the
tree
into
which
you
thus
breathe
your
fever
or
ague
should
be
a
hollow
willow
and
that
in
going
to
the
tree
you
should
be
careful
not
to
utter
a
word
and
not
to
cross
water
again
we
read
of
a
man
who
suffered
acute
pains
in
his
arm
so
they
beat
up
red
corals
with
oaken
leaves
and
having
kept
them
on
the
part
affected
till
suppuration
they
did
in
the
morning
put
this
mixture
into
an
hole
bored
with
an
auger
in
the
root
of
an
oak
respecting
the
east
and
stop
up
this
hole
with
a
peg
made
of
the
same
tree
from
thenceforth
the
pain
did
altogether
cease
and
when
they
took
out
the
amulet
immediately
the
torments
returned
sharper
than
these
facts
seem
to
put
it
beyond
the
reach
of
reasonable
doubt
that
the
pain
or
malady
is
actually
in
the
tree
and
waiting
to
pop
out
if
only
it
gets
the
chance
the
nailing
of
evils
often
the
patient
without
troubling
to
bore
a
hole
in
the
tree
merely
knocks
a
wedge
a
peg
or
a
nail
into
it
believing
that
he
thus
pegs
or
nails
the
sickness
or
pain
into
the
wood
thus
a
bohemian
cure
for
fever
is
to
go
to
a
tree
and
hammer
a
wedge
into
it
with
the
words
there
i
knock
you
in
that
you
may
come
no
more
out
to
a
german
way
of
getting
rid
of
toothache
is
to
go
in
silence
before
sunrise
to
a
tree
especially
a
make
a
slit
in
the
bark
on
the
north
side
of
the
tree
or
on
the
side
that
looks
towards
the
sunrise
cut
out
a
splinter
from
the
place
thus
laid
bare
poke
the
splinter
into
the
aching
tooth
till
blood
comes
then
put
back
the
splinter
in
the
tree
fold
down
the
bark
over
it
and
tie
a
string
round
the
trunk
that
the
splinter
may
grow
into
the
trunk
as
before
as
it
does
so
your
pain
will
vanish
but
you
must
be
careful
not
to
go
near
the
tree
afterwards
or
you
will
get
the
toothache
again
and
any
one
who
pulls
the
splinter
out
will
also
get
the
toothache
he
has
in
fact
uncorked
the
toothache
which
was
safely
bottled
up
in
the
tree
and
he
must
take
the
natural
consequence
of
his
rash
act
a
simpler
plan
practised
in
persia
as
well
as
in
france
and
germany
is
merely
to
scrape
the
aching
tooth
with
a
nail
or
a
twig
till
it
bleeds
and
then
hammer
the
nail
or
the
twig
into
a
tree
in
the
vosges
in
voigtland
and
probably
elsewhere
it
is
believed
that
any
person
who
should
draw
out
such
a
nail
or
twig
would
get
the
toothache
an
old
at
evessen
in
brunswick
is
studded
with
nails
of
various
shapes
including
which
have
been
driven
into
it
by
persons
who
suffered
from
aching
teeth
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
they
say
that
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
when
the
moon
is
on
the
wane
and
that
the
bloody
nail
should
be
knocked
without
a
word
being
spoken
into
the
north
side
of
an
where
the
sun
can
not
shine
on
it
after
that
the
person
will
have
no
more
toothache
so
long
as
the
tree
remains
standing
here
it
is
plainly
implied
that
the
toothache
is
bottled
up
in
the
tree
if
further
proof
were
needed
that
in
such
cases
the
malady
is
actually
transferred
to
the
tree
and
stowed
away
in
its
trunk
it
would
be
afforded
by
the
belief
that
if
the
tree
is
cut
down
the
toothache
will
return
to
the
original
sufferer
rupture
as
well
as
toothache
can
be
nailed
to
an
oak
for
that
purpose
all
that
need
be
done
is
to
take
a
and
touch
with
it
the
injured
part
of
the
patient
then
set
the
sufferer
barefoot
before
an
and
knock
the
nail
into
the
trunk
above
his
head
that
transfers
the
rupture
to
the
tree
and
that
is
why
you
may
often
see
the
boles
of
ancient
oaks
studded
with
nails
such
remedies
are
not
confined
to
europe
at
bilda
in
algeria
there
is
a
sacred
old
in
which
pilgrims
especially
women
knock
nails
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
themselves
of
their
ailments
and
troubles
again
the
majhwars
a
dravidian
tribe
in
the
hill
country
of
south
mirzapur
believe
that
all
disease
is
due
to
ghosts
but
that
ghosts
when
they
become
troublesome
can
be
shut
up
in
a
certain
tree
which
grows
on
a
little
islet
in
a
very
deep
pool
of
the
sukandar
a
tributary
of
the
kanhar
river
accordingly
when
the
country
is
infested
by
ghosts
in
other
words
when
disease
is
raging
a
skilful
wizard
seeks
for
a
piece
of
in
the
jungle
when
he
has
found
it
he
hammers
it
with
a
stone
into
the
tree
and
thus
shuts
up
the
ghost
the
tree
is
covered
with
hundreds
of
such
pieces
of
horn
again
when
a
new
settlement
is
being
made
in
some
parts
of
the
provinces
of
india
it
is
deemed
necessary
to
apprehend
and
lay
by
the
heels
the
local
deities
who
might
otherwise
do
a
deal
of
mischief
to
the
intruders
on
their
domain
a
sorcerer
is
called
in
to
do
the
business
for
days
he
marches
about
the
place
mustering
the
gods
to
the
tuck
of
drum
when
they
are
all
assembled
two
men
known
as
the
earthman
and
the
leafman
who
represent
the
gods
of
the
earth
and
of
the
trees
respectively
become
full
of
the
spirit
being
taken
possession
of
bodily
by
the
local
deities
in
this
exalted
state
they
shout
and
caper
about
in
a
fine
frenzy
and
their
seemingly
disjointed
ejaculations
which
are
really
the
divine
voice
speaking
through
them
are
interpreted
by
the
sorcerer
when
the
critical
moment
has
come
the
wizard
rushes
in
between
the
two
incarnations
of
divinity
clutches
at
the
spirits
which
are
hovering
about
them
in
the
air
and
pours
grains
of
sesame
through
their
hands
into
a
perforated
piece
of
the
wood
of
the
sacred
then
without
a
moment
s
delay
he
plasters
up
the
hole
with
a
mixture
of
clay
and
and
carefully
buries
the
piece
of
wood
on
the
spot
which
is
to
be
the
shrine
of
the
local
deities
needless
to
say
that
the
gods
themselves
are
bunged
up
in
the
wood
and
are
quite
incapable
of
doing
further
mischief
provided
always
that
the
usual
offerings
are
made
to
them
at
the
shrine
where
they
live
in
durance
vile
in
this
case
the
source
of
mischief
is
imprisoned
not
in
a
tree
but
in
a
piece
of
one
but
the
principle
is
clearly
the
same
similarly
in
corea
an
english
lady
observed
at
a
a
small
log
with
several
holes
like
those
of
a
one
of
which
was
plugged
up
doubly
with
bungs
of
wood
she
was
told
that
a
demon
whose
ravages
spread
sickness
in
a
family
had
been
inveigled
by
a
sorceress
into
that
hole
and
securely
bunged
up
it
was
thought
proper
for
all
to
step
over
the
incarcerated
devil
whether
to
express
their
scorn
and
abhorrence
of
him
or
more
probably
as
a
means
of
keeping
him
forcibly
down
in
cochinchina
a
troublesome
ghost
can
be
confined
to
the
grave
by
the
simple
process
of
knocking
a
nail
or
thrusting
a
bar
of
iron
into
the
earth
at
the
point
where
the
head
of
the
corpse
may
be
presumed
to
repose
from
knocking
the
mischief
into
a
tree
or
a
log
it
is
only
a
step
to
knocking
it
into
a
stone
a
a
wall
or
such
like
at
the
head
of
glen
mor
near
port
charlotte
in
islay
there
may
be
seen
a
large
boulder
and
it
is
said
that
whoever
drives
a
nail
into
this
stone
will
thereafter
be
secure
from
attacks
of
toothache
a
farmer
in
islay
told
an
enquirer
some
years
ago
how
a
passing
stranger
once
cured
his
grandmother
of
toothache
by
driving
a
into
the
lintel
of
the
kitchen
door
warning
her
at
the
same
time
to
keep
the
nail
there
and
if
it
should
come
loose
just
to
tap
it
with
a
hammer
till
it
had
a
grip
again
she
had
no
more
toothache
for
the
rest
of
her
life
in
brunswick
it
is
open
to
any
one
to
nail
his
toothache
either
into
a
wall
or
into
a
tree
as
he
thinks
fit
the
pain
is
cured
quite
as
well
in
the
one
way
as
in
the
other
so
in
beauce
and
perche
a
healer
has
been
known
to
place
a
new
nail
on
the
aching
tooth
of
a
sufferer
and
then
knock
the
nail
into
a
door
a
beam
or
a
joist
the
procedure
in
north
africa
is
similar
you
write
certain
arabic
letters
and
numbers
on
the
wall
then
while
the
patient
puts
a
finger
on
the
aching
tooth
you
knock
a
nail
with
a
light
tap
of
a
hammer
into
the
first
letter
on
the
wall
reciting
a
verse
of
the
coran
as
you
do
so
next
you
ask
the
sufferer
whether
the
pain
is
now
abated
and
if
he
says
yes
you
draw
out
the
nail
entirely
but
if
he
says
no
you
shift
the
nail
to
the
next
letter
in
the
wall
and
so
on
till
the
pain
goes
away
which
it
always
does
sooner
or
later
a
bohemian
who
fears
he
is
about
to
have
an
attack
of
fever
will
snatch
up
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
hand
and
nail
it
to
the
wall
that
keeps
the
fever
from
him
as
in
europe
we
nail
toothache
or
fever
to
a
wall
so
in
morocco
they
nail
devils
a
house
in
mogador
having
been
infested
with
devils
who
threw
stones
about
it
in
a
way
that
made
life
a
burden
to
the
inmates
a
holy
man
was
called
in
to
exorcise
them
which
he
did
effectually
by
pronouncing
an
incantation
and
driving
a
nail
into
the
wall
at
every
stroke
of
the
hammer
a
hissing
sound
announced
that
another
devil
had
received
his
quietus
among
the
modern
arabs
the
soul
of
a
murdered
man
must
be
nailed
down
thus
if
a
man
be
murdered
in
egypt
his
ghost
will
rise
from
the
ground
where
his
blood
was
shed
but
it
can
be
prevented
from
doing
so
by
driving
a
new
nail
which
has
never
been
used
into
the
earth
at
the
spot
where
the
murder
was
committed
in
tripoli
the
practice
is
similar
some
years
ago
a
native
was
murdered
close
to
the
door
of
a
little
italian
inn
immediately
the
arabs
of
the
neighbourhood
thronged
thither
and
effectually
laid
the
ghost
with
hammer
and
nail
when
the
innkeeper
rashly
attempted
to
remove
the
nail
he
was
warned
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
set
the
ghost
free
in
modern
egypt
numbers
of
people
afflicted
with
headache
used
to
knock
a
nail
into
the
great
wooden
door
of
the
old
south
gate
of
cairo
for
the
purpose
of
charming
away
the
pain
others
who
suffered
from
toothache
used
to
extract
a
tooth
and
insert
it
in
a
crevice
of
the
door
or
fix
it
in
some
other
way
in
order
to
be
rid
of
toothache
for
the
future
a
holy
and
miraculous
personage
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
was
supposed
to
have
one
of
his
stations
at
this
gate
in
mosul
also
a
sheikh
can
cure
headache
by
first
laying
his
hands
on
the
sufferer
s
head
and
then
hammering
a
nail
into
a
wall
not
far
from
neuenkirchen
in
oldenburg
there
is
a
farmhouse
to
which
while
the
thirty
years
war
was
raging
the
plague
came
lounging
along
from
the
neighbouring
town
in
the
shape
of
a
bluish
vapour
entering
the
house
it
popped
into
a
hole
in
the
of
one
of
the
rooms
the
farmer
saw
his
chance
and
quick
as
thought
he
seized
a
peg
and
hammered
it
into
the
hole
so
that
the
plague
could
not
possibly
get
out
after
a
time
however
thinking
the
danger
was
past
he
drew
out
the
peg
alas
with
the
peg
came
creeping
and
curling
out
of
the
hole
the
blue
vapour
once
more
the
plague
thus
let
loose
seized
on
every
member
of
the
family
in
that
unhappy
house
and
left
not
one
of
them
alive
again
the
great
plague
which
devastated
the
ancient
world
in
the
reign
of
marcus
antoninus
is
said
to
have
originated
in
the
curiosity
and
greed
of
some
roman
soldiers
who
pillaging
the
city
of
seleucia
came
upon
a
narrow
hole
in
a
temple
and
incautiously
enlarged
the
opening
in
the
expectation
of
discovering
treasure
but
that
which
came
forth
from
the
hole
was
not
treasure
but
the
plague
it
had
been
pent
up
in
a
secret
chamber
by
the
magic
art
of
the
chaldeans
but
now
released
from
its
prison
by
the
rash
act
of
the
spoilers
it
stalked
abroad
and
spread
death
and
destruction
from
the
euphrates
to
the
nile
and
the
atlantic
the
simple
ceremony
in
which
to
this
day
the
superstition
of
european
peasants
sees
a
sovereign
remedy
for
plague
and
fever
and
toothache
has
come
down
to
us
from
a
remote
antiquity
for
in
days
when
as
yet
paris
and
london
were
not
when
france
still
revered
the
druids
as
the
masters
of
all
knowledge
human
and
divine
and
when
our
own
country
was
still
covered
with
virgin
forests
the
home
of
savage
beasts
and
savage
men
the
same
ceremony
was
solemnly
performed
from
time
to
time
by
the
highest
magistrate
at
rome
to
stay
the
ravages
of
pestilence
or
retrieve
disaster
that
threatened
the
foundations
of
the
national
life
in
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
the
city
of
rome
was
desolated
by
a
great
plague
which
raged
for
three
years
carrying
off
some
of
the
highest
dignitaries
and
a
great
multitude
of
common
folk
the
historian
who
records
the
calamity
informs
us
that
when
a
banquet
had
been
offered
to
the
gods
in
vain
and
neither
human
counsels
nor
divine
help
availed
to
mitigate
the
violence
of
the
disease
it
was
resolved
for
the
first
time
in
roman
history
to
institute
dramatical
performances
as
an
appropriate
means
of
appeasing
the
wrath
of
the
celestial
powers
accordingly
actors
were
fetched
from
etruria
who
danced
certain
simple
and
decorous
dances
to
the
music
of
a
flute
but
even
this
novel
spectacle
failed
to
amuse
or
touch
to
move
to
tears
or
laughter
the
sullen
gods
the
plague
still
raged
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
actors
were
playing
their
best
in
the
circus
beside
the
tiber
the
yellow
river
rose
in
angry
flood
and
drove
players
and
spectators
wading
and
splashing
through
the
waters
away
from
the
show
it
was
clear
that
the
gods
spurned
plays
as
well
as
prayers
and
banquets
and
in
the
general
consternation
it
was
felt
that
some
more
effectual
measure
should
be
taken
to
put
an
end
to
the
scourge
old
men
remembered
that
a
plague
had
once
been
stayed
by
the
knocking
of
a
nail
into
a
wall
and
accordingly
the
senate
resolved
that
now
in
their
extremity
when
all
other
means
had
failed
a
supreme
magistrate
should
be
appointed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
performing
this
solemn
ceremony
the
appointment
was
made
the
nail
was
knocked
and
the
plague
ceased
sooner
or
later
what
better
proof
could
be
given
of
the
saving
virtue
of
a
nail
twice
more
within
the
same
century
the
roman
people
had
recourse
to
the
same
venerable
ceremony
as
a
cure
for
public
calamities
with
which
the
ordinary
remedies
civil
and
religious
seemed
unable
to
cope
one
of
these
occasions
was
a
pestilence
the
other
was
a
strange
mortality
among
the
leading
men
which
public
opinion
traced
rightly
or
wrongly
to
a
series
of
nefarious
crimes
perpetrated
by
noble
matrons
who
took
their
husbands
off
by
poison
the
crimes
real
or
imaginary
were
set
down
to
frenzy
and
nothing
could
be
thought
of
so
likely
to
minister
to
minds
diseased
as
the
knocking
of
a
nail
into
a
wall
search
among
the
annals
of
the
city
proved
that
in
a
season
of
civil
discord
when
the
state
had
been
rent
by
party
feud
the
same
remedy
the
same
soothing
balm
had
been
applied
with
the
happiest
results
to
the
jarring
interests
and
heated
passions
of
the
disputants
accordingly
the
old
nostrum
was
tried
once
more
and
again
success
appeared
to
justify
the
experiment
if
the
romans
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
thus
deemed
it
possible
to
rid
themselves
of
pestilence
frenzy
and
sedition
by
hammering
them
into
a
wall
even
as
french
and
german
peasants
still
rid
themselves
of
fever
and
toothache
by
knocking
them
into
a
tree
their
prudent
ancestors
appear
to
have
determined
that
so
salutary
a
measure
should
not
be
restricted
in
its
scope
to
meeting
special
and
urgent
emergencies
as
they
arose
but
should
regularly
diffuse
its
benefits
over
the
community
by
anticipating
and
as
it
were
nipping
in
the
bud
evils
which
left
unchecked
might
grow
to
dangerous
proportions
this
we
may
conjecture
was
the
original
intention
of
an
ancient
roman
law
which
ordained
that
the
highest
magistrate
of
the
republic
should
knock
in
a
nail
every
year
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
september
the
law
might
be
seen
couched
in
language
engraved
on
a
tablet
which
was
fastened
to
a
wall
of
the
temple
of
capitoline
jupiter
and
although
the
place
where
the
nails
were
driven
in
is
nowhere
definitely
stated
by
classical
writers
there
are
some
grounds
for
thinking
that
it
may
have
been
the
same
wall
on
which
the
law
that
sanctioned
the
custom
was
exhibited
livy
tells
us
that
the
duty
of
affixing
the
nail
at
one
time
discharged
by
the
consuls
was
afterwards
committed
to
dictators
whose
higher
rank
consorted
better
with
the
dignity
and
importance
of
the
function
at
a
later
time
the
custom
fell
into
abeyance
and
the
ancient
ceremony
was
revived
only
from
time
to
time
in
seasons
of
grave
peril
or
extraordinary
calamity
which
seemed
to
attest
the
displeasure
of
the
gods
at
modern
ways
and
disposed
men
to
bethink
them
of
ancestral
lore
and
to
walk
in
the
old
paths
in
antiquity
the
annual
practice
of
hammering
a
nail
into
a
wall
was
not
confined
to
rome
it
was
observed
also
at
vulsinii
in
etruria
where
the
nails
thus
fixed
in
the
temple
of
the
goddess
nortia
served
as
a
convenient
means
of
recording
and
numbering
the
years
to
roman
antiquaries
of
a
later
period
it
seemed
naturally
enough
that
such
a
practice
had
indeed
no
other
object
than
that
of
marking
the
flight
of
time
in
ages
when
writing
was
but
little
used
yet
a
little
reflection
will
probably
convince
us
that
this
though
it
was
doubtless
a
useful
consequence
of
the
custom
can
hardly
have
been
its
original
intention
for
it
will
scarcely
be
disputed
that
the
annual
observance
of
the
custom
can
not
be
wholly
dissociated
from
its
occasional
observance
in
seasons
of
great
danger
or
calamity
and
that
whatever
explanation
we
give
of
the
one
ought
to
apply
to
the
other
also
now
it
is
plain
that
if
we
start
from
the
annual
observance
and
regard
it
as
no
more
than
a
timekeeper
or
mode
of
recording
the
years
we
shall
never
reach
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
occasional
observance
if
the
nails
were
merely
ready
reckoners
of
the
years
how
could
they
come
to
be
used
as
supreme
remedies
for
pestilence
frenzy
and
sedition
resorted
to
by
the
state
in
desperate
emergencies
when
all
the
ordinary
resources
of
policy
and
religion
had
failed
on
the
other
hand
if
we
start
from
the
occasional
observance
and
view
it
in
accordance
with
modern
analogies
as
a
rude
attempt
to
dispose
of
intangible
evils
as
if
they
were
things
that
could
be
handled
and
put
away
out
of
sight
we
can
readily
understand
how
such
an
attempt
from
being
made
occasionally
might
come
to
be
repeated
annually
for
the
sake
of
wiping
out
all
the
old
troubles
and
misfortunes
of
the
past
year
and
enabling
the
community
to
start
afresh
unencumbered
by
a
fardel
of
ills
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
fortunately
we
can
shew
that
the
analogy
which
is
thus
assumed
to
exist
between
the
roman
custom
and
modern
superstition
is
not
a
merely
fanciful
one
in
other
words
it
can
be
proved
that
the
romans
like
modern
clowns
did
believe
in
the
possibility
of
nailing
down
trouble
in
a
literal
and
physical
sense
into
a
material
substance
pliny
tells
us
that
an
alleged
cure
for
epilepsy
or
the
falling
sickness
was
to
drive
an
iron
nail
into
the
ground
on
the
spot
which
was
first
struck
by
the
patient
s
head
as
he
fell
in
the
light
of
the
modern
instances
which
have
come
before
us
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
cure
was
supposed
to
consist
in
actually
nailing
the
disease
into
the
earth
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
get
up
and
attack
the
sufferer
again
precisely
parallel
is
a
suffolk
cure
for
ague
you
must
go
by
night
alone
to
a
and
just
as
the
clock
strikes
the
midnight
hour
you
must
turn
yourself
about
thrice
and
drive
a
tenpenny
nail
up
to
the
head
into
the
ground
then
walk
away
backwards
from
the
spot
before
the
clock
is
done
striking
twelve
and
you
will
miss
the
ague
but
the
next
person
who
passes
over
the
nail
will
catch
the
malady
in
your
stead
here
it
is
plainly
assumed
that
the
ague
of
which
the
patient
is
relieved
has
been
left
by
him
nailed
down
into
the
earth
at
the
and
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
a
similar
assumption
underlay
the
roman
cure
for
epilepsy
further
we
seem
to
be
now
justified
in
holding
that
originally
when
a
roman
dictator
sought
to
stay
a
plague
to
restore
concord
or
to
terminate
an
epidemic
of
madness
by
knocking
a
nail
into
a
wall
he
was
doing
for
the
commonwealth
exactly
what
any
private
man
might
do
for
an
epileptic
patient
by
knocking
a
nail
into
the
ground
on
the
spot
where
his
poor
friend
had
collapsed
in
other
words
he
was
hammering
the
plague
the
discord
or
the
madness
into
a
hole
from
which
it
could
not
get
out
to
afflict
the
community
again
different
in
principle
from
the
foregoing
customs
appears
to
be
the
loango
practice
of
sticking
nails
into
wooden
idols
or
fetishes
the
intention
of
knocking
a
nail
into
a
worshipful
image
is
said
to
be
simply
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
deity
in
a
forcible
manner
to
the
request
of
his
worshipper
it
is
like
pinching
a
man
or
running
a
pin
into
his
leg
as
a
hint
that
you
desire
to
speak
with
him
hence
in
order
to
be
quite
sure
of
riveting
the
god
s
attention
the
nails
are
sometimes
made
even
the
most
deity
could
hardly
overlook
a
petition
urged
in
so
importunate
a
fashion
the
practice
is
resorted
to
in
many
emergencies
for
example
when
a
man
has
been
robbed
he
will
go
and
get
a
priest
to
knock
a
nail
into
an
idol
the
sharp
pang
naturally
exasperates
the
deity
and
he
seeks
to
wreak
his
wrath
on
the
thief
who
is
the
real
occasion
of
his
suffering
so
when
the
thief
hears
of
what
has
been
done
he
brings
back
the
stolen
goods
in
fear
and
trembling
similarly
a
nail
may
be
knocked
into
an
idol
for
the
purpose
of
making
somebody
fall
ill
and
if
a
sick
man
fancies
that
his
illness
is
due
to
an
enemy
who
has
played
him
this
trick
he
will
send
to
the
priest
of
the
idol
and
pay
him
to
remove
the
nail
this
mode
of
refreshing
the
memory
and
stimulating
the
activity
of
a
supernatural
being
is
not
confined
to
the
negroes
of
loango
it
is
practised
also
by
french
catholics
as
we
learn
from
sir
john
rhys
some
years
ago
he
writes
when
i
was
on
a
visit
at
the
late
ernest
renan
s
house
at
rosmapamon
near
on
the
north
coast
of
brittany
our
genial
host
took
his
friends
one
day
to
see
some
of
the
sights
of
that
neighbourhood
among
other
things
which
he
showed
us
was
a
statue
of
guirec
standing
at
the
head
of
an
open
creek
it
was
of
wood
and
altogether
a
very
rude
work
of
art
if
such
it
might
be
called
but
what
attracted
our
attention
most
was
the
fact
that
it
had
innumerable
pins
stuck
into
it
we
asked
renan
what
the
pins
meant
and
his
explanation
was
exceedingly
quaint
he
said
that
when
any
young
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
made
up
her
mind
that
she
should
marry
she
came
there
and
asked
the
saint
to
provide
her
with
a
husband
and
to
do
so
without
undue
delay
she
had
every
confidence
in
the
willingness
and
ability
of
the
saint
to
oblige
her
but
she
was
haunted
by
the
fear
that
he
might
be
otherwise
engaged
and
forget
her
request
so
she
would
stick
pins
into
him
and
thus
goad
him
as
she
fancied
to
exert
himself
on
her
behalf
this
is
why
the
saint
s
statue
was
full
of
similarly
in
japan
sufferers
from
toothache
sometimes
stick
needles
into
a
believing
that
the
pain
caused
to
the
will
force
it
to
exercise
its
power
to
thus
it
would
seem
that
we
must
distinguish
at
least
two
uses
of
nails
or
pins
in
their
application
to
spirits
and
spiritual
influences
in
one
set
of
cases
the
nails
act
as
corks
or
bungs
to
bottle
up
and
imprison
a
troublesome
spirit
in
the
other
set
of
cases
they
act
as
spurs
or
goads
to
refresh
his
memory
and
stimulate
his
activity
but
so
far
as
the
evidence
which
i
have
cited
allows
us
to
judge
the
use
of
nails
as
spiritual
bungs
appears
to
be
commoner
than
their
use
as
mental
refreshers
chapter
ii
the
omnipresence
of
demons
in
the
foregoing
chapter
the
primitive
principle
of
the
transference
of
ills
to
another
person
animal
or
thing
was
explained
and
illustrated
a
consideration
of
the
means
taken
in
accordance
with
this
principle
to
rid
individuals
of
their
troubles
and
distresses
led
us
to
believe
that
at
rome
similar
means
had
been
adopted
to
free
the
whole
community
at
a
single
blow
of
the
hammer
from
diverse
evils
that
afflicted
it
i
now
propose
to
shew
that
such
attempts
to
dismiss
at
once
the
accumulated
sorrows
of
a
people
are
by
no
means
rare
or
exceptional
but
that
on
the
contrary
they
have
been
made
in
many
lands
and
that
from
being
occasional
they
tend
to
become
periodic
and
annual
it
needs
some
effort
on
our
part
to
realise
the
frame
of
mind
which
prompts
these
attempts
bred
in
a
philosophy
which
strips
nature
of
personality
and
reduces
it
to
the
unknown
cause
of
an
orderly
series
of
impressions
on
our
senses
we
find
it
hard
to
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
the
savage
to
whom
the
same
impressions
appear
in
the
guise
of
spirits
or
the
handiwork
of
spirits
for
ages
the
army
of
spirits
once
so
near
has
been
receding
further
and
further
from
us
banished
by
the
magic
wand
of
science
from
hearth
and
home
from
ruined
cell
and
ivied
tower
from
haunted
glade
and
lonely
mere
from
the
riven
murky
cloud
that
belches
forth
the
lightning
and
from
those
fairer
clouds
that
pillow
the
silver
moon
or
fret
with
flakes
of
burning
red
the
golden
eve
the
spirits
are
gone
even
from
their
last
stronghold
in
the
sky
whose
blue
arch
no
longer
passes
except
with
children
for
the
screen
that
hides
from
mortal
eyes
the
glories
of
the
celestial
world
only
in
poets
dreams
or
impassioned
flights
of
oratory
is
it
given
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
last
flutter
of
the
standards
of
the
retreating
host
to
hear
the
beat
of
their
invisible
wings
the
sound
of
their
mocking
laughter
or
the
swell
of
angel
music
dying
away
in
the
distance
far
otherwise
is
it
with
the
savage
to
his
imagination
the
world
still
teems
with
those
motley
beings
whom
a
more
sober
philosophy
has
discarded
fairies
and
goblins
ghosts
and
demons
still
hover
about
him
both
waking
and
sleeping
they
dog
his
footsteps
dazzle
his
senses
enter
into
him
harass
and
deceive
and
torment
him
in
a
thousand
freakish
and
mischievous
ways
the
mishaps
that
befall
him
the
losses
he
sustains
the
pains
he
has
to
endure
he
commonly
sets
down
if
not
to
the
magic
of
his
enemies
to
the
spite
or
anger
or
caprice
of
the
spirits
their
constant
presence
wearies
him
their
sleepless
malignity
exasperates
him
he
longs
with
an
unspeakable
longing
to
be
rid
of
them
altogether
and
from
time
to
time
driven
to
bay
his
patience
utterly
exhausted
he
turns
fiercely
on
his
persecutors
and
makes
a
desperate
effort
to
chase
the
whole
pack
of
them
from
the
land
to
clear
the
air
of
their
swarming
multitudes
that
he
may
breathe
more
freely
and
go
on
his
way
unmolested
at
least
for
a
time
thus
it
comes
about
that
the
endeavour
of
primitive
people
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
all
their
troubles
generally
takes
the
form
of
a
grand
hunting
out
and
expulsion
of
devils
or
ghosts
they
think
that
if
they
can
only
shake
off
these
their
accursed
tormentors
they
will
make
a
fresh
start
in
life
happy
and
innocent
the
tales
of
eden
and
the
old
poetic
golden
age
will
come
true
again
hence
before
we
review
some
examples
of
these
it
may
be
well
to
adduce
evidence
of
the
deep
hold
which
a
belief
in
the
omnipresence
and
malignity
of
spirits
has
upon
the
primitive
mind
the
reader
will
be
better
able
to
understand
the
savage
remedy
when
he
has
an
inkling
of
the
nature
of
the
evil
which
it
is
designed
to
combat
in
citing
the
evidence
i
shall
for
the
most
part
reproduce
the
exact
words
of
my
authorities
lest
i
should
incur
the
suspicion
of
deepening
unduly
the
shadows
in
a
gloomy
picture
thus
in
regard
to
the
aborigines
of
australia
we
are
told
that
the
number
of
supernatural
beings
feared
if
not
loved
that
they
acknowledge
is
exceedingly
great
for
not
only
are
the
heavens
peopled
with
such
but
the
whole
face
of
the
country
swarms
with
them
every
thicket
most
and
all
rocky
places
abound
with
evil
spirits
in
like
manner
every
natural
phenomenon
is
believed
to
be
the
work
of
demons
none
of
which
seem
of
a
benign
nature
one
and
all
apparently
striving
to
do
all
imaginable
mischief
to
the
poor
the
negro
says
another
writer
is
wont
to
regard
the
whole
world
around
him
as
peopled
with
invisible
beings
to
whom
he
imputes
every
misfortune
that
happens
to
him
and
from
whose
harmful
influence
he
seeks
to
protect
himself
by
all
kinds
of
magic
the
bantu
negroes
of
western
africa
regard
their
god
as
the
creator
of
man
plants
animals
and
the
earth
and
they
hold
that
having
made
them
he
takes
no
further
interest
in
the
affair
but
not
so
the
crowd
of
spirits
with
which
the
universe
is
peopled
they
take
only
too
much
interest
and
the
bantu
wishes
they
would
not
and
is
perpetually
saying
so
in
his
prayers
a
large
percentage
whereof
amounts
to
go
away
we
don
t
want
come
not
into
this
house
this
village
or
its
almost
all
these
subordinate
spirits
are
malevolent
a
similar
but
fuller
account
of
the
west
african
creed
is
given
by
a
german
writer
whose
statements
apply
particularly
to
the
negroes
of
the
slave
coast
he
says
thus
the
term
fetishism
denotes
the
attitude
of
the
ewes
or
of
west
african
negro
tribes
in
general
towards
magic
it
forms
one
of
the
principal
constituents
of
their
religion
the
other
main
constituent
is
their
attitude
to
the
gods
which
is
properly
demonolatry
the
ewe
names
the
gods
that
is
intermediaries
namely
between
a
supreme
being
whom
he
calls
the
unsurpassable
and
mankind
the
drowo
with
whom
the
ewe
has
to
do
to
whom
his
offerings
and
his
respects
are
paid
are
thus
subordinate
deities
who
according
to
the
etymological
meaning
of
the
word
are
conceived
as
judging
composing
disputes
and
mediating
among
men
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
is
by
no
means
unfamiliar
to
the
ewe
he
has
his
often
in
his
mouth
especially
in
talking
with
the
missionary
and
he
willingly
acknowledges
that
created
him
and
the
gods
but
he
can
only
conceive
of
this
supreme
being
on
the
analogy
of
his
own
personality
and
not
as
omnipresent
and
so
forth
it
is
impossible
that
this
mawu
can
trouble
himself
about
details
in
the
creation
or
even
about
every
individual
man
and
his
petty
affairs
what
would
be
the
use
of
the
many
higher
and
lower
spirits
with
which
the
world
is
filled
before
his
eyes
the
west
african
perhaps
conceives
of
god
as
transcendant
but
not
as
immanent
a
creation
he
possibly
apprehends
but
not
an
omnipresent
government
of
the
world
by
the
supreme
being
that
government
is
carried
on
by
mawu
at
a
distance
by
means
of
the
many
spirits
or
subordinate
gods
whom
he
has
created
for
the
purpose
a
portion
of
the
gods
fills
the
air
wherefore
the
forces
and
the
phenomena
of
nature
are
deified
as
their
manifestations
the
elements
are
thought
to
be
moved
by
the
gods
of
the
air
in
the
storm
and
the
wind
in
thunder
and
lightning
the
ewe
sees
the
manifestation
of
particularly
powerful
gods
in
the
mysterious
roll
and
roar
of
the
deep
sea
the
ewe
like
the
negro
in
general
beholds
the
sway
of
a
very
mighty
god
or
of
a
whole
host
of
gods
further
the
earth
itself
is
also
the
abode
of
a
multitude
of
spirits
or
gods
who
have
in
it
their
sphere
of
activity
they
inhabit
certain
great
mountains
great
hollow
trees
caves
rivers
and
especially
woods
in
such
woods
of
the
gods
no
timber
may
be
felled
thus
the
gods
fill
not
only
the
air
and
the
sea
they
also
walk
on
earth
on
all
paths
they
lurk
under
the
trees
they
terrify
the
lonely
wayfarer
they
disquiet
and
plague
even
the
sleeper
when
the
negro
rises
from
the
stool
on
which
he
has
been
sitting
he
never
fails
to
turn
it
upside
down
to
prevent
a
spirit
from
sitting
down
on
it
the
falls
into
two
main
classes
there
are
good
and
kindly
spirits
whose
help
is
eagerly
sought
by
offerings
but
there
are
also
gloomy
and
revengeful
spirits
whose
approach
and
influence
people
eagerly
endeavour
to
avert
and
against
whom
all
possible
means
are
employed
to
ban
them
from
the
houses
and
villages
the
people
are
much
more
zealous
in
their
devotion
to
the
evil
spirits
than
in
their
devotion
to
the
good
the
reason
is
that
the
feeling
of
fear
and
the
consciousness
of
guilt
are
much
stronger
than
the
emotions
of
love
and
gratitude
for
benefits
received
hence
the
worship
of
the
false
gods
or
spirits
among
this
people
and
among
the
west
african
negro
tribes
in
general
is
properly
speaking
a
worship
of
demons
or
again
a
missionary
who
spent
fifteen
years
among
the
boloki
of
the
upper
congo
river
tells
us
that
the
religion
of
the
boloki
has
its
basis
in
their
fear
of
those
numerous
invisible
spirits
which
surround
them
on
every
side
and
are
constantly
trying
to
compass
their
sickness
misfortune
and
death
and
the
boloki
s
sole
object
in
practising
their
religion
is
to
cajole
or
appease
cheat
or
conquer
and
kill
those
spirits
that
trouble
their
their
rites
their
ceremonies
and
their
charms
if
there
were
no
evil
spirits
to
be
circumvented
there
would
be
no
need
of
their
medicine
men
and
their
the
boloki
folk
believe
they
are
surrounded
by
spirits
which
try
to
thwart
them
at
every
twist
and
turn
and
to
harm
them
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
the
rivers
and
creeks
are
crowded
with
the
spirits
of
their
ancestors
and
the
forests
and
bush
are
full
also
of
spirits
ever
seeking
to
injure
the
living
who
are
overtaken
by
night
when
travelling
by
road
or
canoe
i
never
met
among
them
a
man
daring
enough
to
go
at
night
through
the
forest
that
divided
monsembe
from
the
upper
villages
even
though
a
large
reward
was
offered
their
invariable
reply
was
there
are
too
many
spirits
in
the
bush
and
the
spirits
which
these
people
dread
so
much
are
the
or
disembodied
souls
of
the
dead
the
life
of
the
boloki
is
described
as
one
long
drawn
out
fear
of
what
the
may
next
do
to
these
dangerous
beings
dwell
everywhere
land
and
water
are
full
of
them
they
are
ever
ready
to
pounce
on
the
living
and
carry
them
away
or
to
smite
them
with
disease
and
kill
them
though
they
are
invisible
to
common
eyes
the
can
see
them
and
can
cork
them
up
in
calabashes
or
cover
them
up
with
saucepans
indeed
if
it
is
made
worth
his
while
he
can
even
destroy
them
altogether
again
of
the
bantu
tribes
of
south
africa
we
read
that
nearer
than
the
spirits
of
deceased
chiefs
or
of
their
own
ancestors
was
a
whole
host
of
hobgoblins
water
sprites
and
malevolent
demons
who
met
the
bantu
turn
which
way
they
would
there
was
no
beautiful
fairyland
for
them
for
all
the
beings
who
haunted
the
mountains
the
plains
and
the
rivers
were
ministers
of
evil
the
most
feared
of
these
was
a
large
bird
that
made
love
to
women
and
incited
those
who
returned
its
affection
to
cause
the
death
of
those
who
did
not
and
a
little
mischievous
imp
who
was
also
amorously
inclined
many
instances
could
be
gathered
from
the
records
of
magistrates
courts
in
recent
years
of
demented
women
having
admitted
their
acquaintance
with
these
fabulous
creatures
as
well
as
of
whole
communities
living
in
terror
of
however
it
would
be
no
doubt
a
great
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
minds
of
the
bantu
or
indeed
of
any
savages
are
perpetually
occupied
by
a
dread
of
evil
spirits
the
savage
and
indeed
the
civilized
man
is
incapable
at
least
in
his
normal
state
of
such
excessive
preoccupation
with
a
single
idea
which
if
prolonged
could
hardly
fail
to
end
in
insanity
speaking
of
the
spirits
which
the
indians
of
guiana
attribute
to
all
objects
in
nature
sir
everard
im
thurn
observes
that
the
whole
world
of
the
indian
swarms
with
these
beings
if
by
a
mighty
mental
effort
we
could
for
a
moment
revert
to
a
similar
mental
position
we
should
find
ourselves
everywhere
surrounded
by
a
host
of
possibly
hurtful
beings
so
many
in
number
that
to
describe
them
as
innumerable
would
fall
ridiculously
short
of
the
truth
it
is
not
therefore
wonderful
that
the
indian
fears
to
move
beyond
the
light
of
his
after
dark
or
if
he
is
obliged
to
do
so
carries
a
with
him
that
he
may
at
least
see
among
what
enemies
he
walks
nor
is
it
wonderful
that
occasionally
the
air
round
the
settlement
seems
to
the
indian
to
grow
so
full
of
beings
that
a
peaiman
sorcerer
who
is
supposed
to
have
the
power
of
temporarily
driving
them
away
is
employed
to
effect
a
general
clearance
of
these
beings
if
only
for
a
time
that
is
the
main
belief
of
the
kind
that
is
generally
called
religious
of
the
indians
of
the
lengua
indians
of
the
paraguayan
chaco
believe
in
certain
demons
which
they
call
the
are
confined
to
no
particular
place
time
and
distance
do
not
seem
to
affect
them
in
the
least
they
are
held
in
great
awe
by
the
indian
and
whithersoever
he
turns
whether
by
day
or
night
but
particularly
at
night
he
is
subject
to
their
malign
influences
they
live
in
constant
dread
of
these
supernatural
beings
and
if
nothing
else
contributed
to
make
their
life
miserable
this
dread
of
the
would
be
in
itself
quite
sufficient
to
rob
it
of
most
of
its
very
different
from
the
life
of
these
indians
of
the
south
american

the
life
of
the
esquimaux
on
the
desolate
shores
of
labrador
yet
they
too
live
in
like
bondage
to
the
evil
creatures
of
their
own
imagination
all
the
affairs
of
life
are
supposed
to
be
under
the
control
of
spirits
each
of
which
rules
over
a
certain
element
and
all
of
which
are
under
the
direction
of
a
greater
spirit
each
person
is
supposed
to
be
attended
by
a
special
guardian
who
is
malignant
in
character
ever
ready
to
seize
upon
the
least
occasion
to
work
harm
upon
the
individual
whom
it
accompanies
as
this
is
an
evil
spirit
its
good
offices
and
assistance
can
be
obtained
by
propitiation
only
the
person
strives
to
keep
the
of
the
evil
spirit
by
offerings
of
food
water
and
besides
this
class
of
spirits
there
are
the
spirits
of
the
sea
the
land
the
sky
for
be
it
understood
that
the
eskimo
know
nothing
of
the
air
the
winds
the
clouds
and
everything
in
nature
every
cove
of
the
every
point
island
and
prominent
rock
has
its
guardian
spirit
all
are
of
the
malignant
type
and
to
be
propitiated
only
by
acceptable
offerings
from
persons
who
desire
to
visit
the
locality
where
it
is
supposed
to
reside
of
course
some
of
the
spirits
are
more
powerful
than
others
and
these
are
more
to
be
dreaded
than
those
able
to
inflict
less
harm
these
minor
spirits
are
under
the
control
of
the
great
spirit
whose
name
is
tung
ak
this
one
great
spirit
is
more
powerful
than
all
the
rest
besides
the
lesser
spirits
are
immediately
under
his
control
and
ever
ready
to
obey
his
command
the
shaman
or
conjuror
alone
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
deal
with
the
tung
ak
while
the
shaman
does
not
profess
to
be
superior
to
the
tung
ak
he
is
able
to
enlist
his
assistance
and
thus
be
able
to
control
all
the
undertakings
his
profession
may
call
for
this
tung
ak
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
death
which
ever
seeks
to
torment
and
harass
the
lives
of
people
that
their
spirits
may
go
to
dwell
with
brighter
at
first
sight
and
more
pleasing
is
the
mythology
of
the
islanders
of
the
pacific
as
the
picture
of
it
is
drawn
for
us
by
one
who
seems
to
have
felt
the
charm
of
those
beliefs
which
it
was
his
mission
to
destroy
by
their
rude
mythology
he
says
each
lovely
island
was
made
a
sort
of
and
the
spells
of
enchantment
were
thrown
over
its
varied
scenes
the
sentiment
of
the
poet
that
of
spiritual
creatures
walk
the
earth
both
when
we
wake
and
when
we
was
one
familiar
to
their
minds
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
interested
in
a
people
who
were
accustomed
to
consider
themselves
surrounded
by
invisible
intelligences
and
who
recognized
in
the
rising
mild
and
silver
shooting
meteor
s
transient
ocean
s
tempest
s
blast
or
the
evening
movements
of
mighty
spirits
the
mountain

summit
and
the
fleecy
mists
that
hang
upon
its
rocky
foaming
the
lonely
all
regarded
as
the
abode
or
resort
of
these
invisible
yet
the
spiritual
powers
which
compassed
the
life
of
the
islanders
on
every
side
appear
to
have
been
far
from
friendly
to
man
speaking
of
their
beliefs
touching
the
souls
of
the
dead
the
same
writer
says
that
the
polynesians
imagined
they
lived
in
a
world
of
spirits
which
surrounded
them
night
and
day
watching
every
action
of
their
lives
and
ready
to
avenge
the
slightest
neglect
or
the
least
disobedience
to
their
injunctions
as
proclaimed
by
their
priests
these
dreaded
beings
were
seldom
thought
to
resort
to
the
habitations
of
men
on
errands
of
the
tahitians
when
they
were
visited
by
captain

that
sudden
deaths
and
all
other
accidents
are
effected
by
the
immediate
action
of
some
divinity

a

stumble
against
a
stone

hurt
his

impute
it
to
an
so
that
they
may
be
literally

agreeably
to
their
system
to
tread
enchanted
the
maori
gods
says
a
writer
were
demons
whose
evil
designs
could
only
be
counteracted
by
powerful
spells
and
charms
these
proving
effectual
sacrifices
and
offerings
were
made
to
soothe
the
vanquished
spirits
and
appease

themselves
visible
in
the
form
of
lizards
moths
butterflies
spiders
and
even
flies
when
they
spoke
it
was
in
a
low
whistling

we
are
informed
that
the
popular
religion
of
the
pelew
islanders
has
reference
to
the
gods

may
be
useful
or
harmful
to
men

their
doings
their

the
earth
with
numerous
gods
and
whatever
a
man
undertakes
be
it
to
catch
fish
or
fell

tree
he
must
first
propitiate
the
deities
or
rather
guard
himself
against
their
spiteful
anger
which
can
only
be
done
by
means
of
certain
spells
and
incantations
the
knowledge
of
these
incantations
is
limited
to
a
very
few
persons
and
forms
in
fact
the
secret
of
the
arts
and
industries
which
are
plied
in
the
islands
a
master
of
his
craft
is
not
he
who
can
build
a
good
house
or
a
faultless
canoe
but
he
who
possesses
the
or
magic
power
to
ban
the
that
they
may
not
prove

the
workmen
and
to
the
people
who
afterwards
use
the
things
all
these
gods
of
the
earth
the
woods
the
mountains
the
brooks
are
very
mischievous
and
dangerous
and
most
diseases
are
caused
by
them
hence
the
persons
who
possess
the
magic
power
are
dreaded
frequently
employed
and
well
paid
but
in
extreme
cases
they
are
regarded
as
sorcerers
and
treated
accordingly
if
one
of
them
builds
a
house
for
somebody
and
is
dissatisfied
with
his
remuneration
he
stirs
up
the
to
avenge
him
so
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
he
has
built
fall
sick
and
if
help
is
not
forthcoming
they
of
the
mortlock
islanders
we
are
told
that
their
imagination
peopled
the
whole
of
nature
with
spirits
and
deities
of
whom
the
number
was
past
finding
speaking
of
the
natives
of
the
philippine
islands
a
writer
observes
that
the
basis
of
all
the
superstitious
beliefs
of
the
negritos
what
might
else
be
termed
their
religion
is
the
constant
presence
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
near
where
they
lived
when
alive
all
places
are
inhabited
by
the
spirits
all
adverse
circumstances
sickness
failure
of
crops
unsuccessful
hunts
are
attributed
to
as
to
the
melanesians
of
new
britain
we
read
that
another
deeply
rooted
belief
which
exercises
an
extraordinary
influence
on
the
life
and
customs
of
these
people
is
a
belief
in
demons
to
their
thinking
the
demons
a
word
synonymous
with
poor
wretch
sufferer
are
spirits
entirely
perverse
deceitful
maleficent
and
ceaselessly
occupied
in
injuring
us
diseases
death
the
perturbations
of
nature
all
unfortunate
events
are
imputed
to
them
the
demons
exist
in
legions
they
live
everywhere
especially
in
the
forests
desert
places
and
the
depths
of
the
the
beliefs
and
customs
of
one
particular
tribe
of
this
great
livuans
who
occupy
the
eastern
coast
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
been
described
by
a
catholic
missionary
in
similar
terms
the
distrustful
natives
he
tells
us
have
not
attained
to
a
belief
in
a
beneficent
compassionate
deity
all
the
more
numerous
however
are
the
evil
spirits
with
which
they
people
the
universe
these
are
legion
the
power
which
the
natives
ascribe
to
these
spirits
extends
not
merely
to
the
property
of
mankind
but
also
to
life
and
death
the
livuan
always
believes
that
he
can
trace
the
pernicious
influence
of
these
devils
on
his
actions
in
his
conviction
the
whole
thoughts
and
endeavours
of
the
evil
spirits
have
no
other
object
than
to
injure
men
in
every
possible
way
this
dismal
comfortless
superstition
weighs
heavy
on
the
again
another
writer
who
lived
for
thirty
years
among
the
melanesians
of
the
bismarck
archipelago
of
which
new
britain
forms
part
observes
that
we
often
find
the
view
expressed
that
the
native
is
a
being
who
lives
only
for
the
day
without
cares
of
any
kind
the
view
is
very
erroneous
for
in
fact
he
leads
a
life
which
is
plagued
by
cares
of
all
sorts
amongst
the
greatest
plagues
of
his
life
is
his
bottomless
superstition
he
sees
himself
surrounded
at
every
step
by
evil
spirits
and
their
influences
he
trusts
nobody
for
who
knows
whether
his
nearest
neighbour
his
professedly
best
friend
is
not
plotting
to
bring
trouble
sickness
and
even
death
on
him
by
means
of
magic
everywhere
he
sees
snares
set
for
him
everywhere
he
scents
treachery
and
guile
we
need
not
wonder
therefore
that
mistrust
is
a
leading
feature
in
the
character
not
only
of
the
new
britons
but
of
the
melanesians
generally
the
native
is
simply
not
accessible
to
rational
motives
the
only
motive
he
understands
is
sorcery
on
the
part
of
malicious
men
or
the
influence
of
evil
a
dutch
missionary
who
spent
years
among
the
natives
of
dutch
new
guinea
tells
us
that
in
their
ignorance
of
a
living
god
the
papuans
people
earth
and
air
land
and
sea
with
mysterious
malignant
powers
which
take
up
their
abode
in
stones
and
trees
or
in
men
and
cause
all
kinds
of
misfortunes
especially
sickness
and
again
speaking
of
the
bukaua
a
tribe
of
german
new
guinea
a
german
missionary
writes
that
the
bukaua
knows
himself
to
be
surrounded
by
spirits
at
every
step
an
insight
into
the
life
and
mode
of
thought
of
the
natives
as
the
latter
is
expressed
especially
in
their
stories
confirms
this
view
completely
what
wonder
that
the
fear
of
spirits
dominates
the
whole
existence
of
the
bukaua
and
causes
him
to
tremble
even
in
the
hour
of
death
there
are
spirits
of
the
beach
the
water
the
fields
the
forests
spirits
that
reside
in
the
villages
and
particular
places
and
a
sort
of
vagabonds
who
can
take
up
their
abode
even
in
lifeless
then
after
describing
the
demons
of
the
beach
the
water
and
the
field
the
writer
proceeds
as
follows
of
forest
spirits
the
number
is
infinite
for
it
is
above
all
in
the
mysterious
darkness
the
tangled
wildernesses
of
the
virgin
forest
that
the
spirits
love
to
dwell
they
hold
their
meetings
in
what
are
called
evil
places
they
are
never
bent
on
good
especially
at
nightfall
the
native
fancies
he
hears
the
voice
of
the
spirits
in
the
hum
and
chirping
of
the
insects
in
the
forest
they
lure
hunting
dogs
from
the
trail
they
make
wild
boars
rabid
in
the
form
of
snakes
they
make
inroads
into
human
dwellings
they
drive
men
crazy
or
into
fits
they
play
roguish
tricks
of
all
among
the
tribes
who
inhabit
the
coasts
of
new
guinea
a
death
in
a
village
is
the
occasion
of
bringing
plenty
of
ghosts
to
escort
their
new
companion
and
perhaps
fetch
some
one
else
all
night
the
friends
of
the
deceased
sit
up
and
keep
the
drums
going
to
drive
away
the
spirits
when
i
was
sleeping
one
night
at
hood
bay
a
party
of
young
men
and
boys
came
round
with
sticks
striking
the
fences
and
posts
of
houses
all
through
the
village
this
i
found
was
always
done
when
any
one
died
to
drive
back
the
spirits
to
their
own
quarters
on
the
adjacent
mountain
tops
but
it
is
the
spirits
of
the
inland
tribes
the
aborigines
of
the
country
that
the
coast
tribes
most
fear
the
road
from
the
interior
to
port
moresby
passed
close
to
our
house
and
the
natives
told
us
that
the
barking
of
our
english
dog
at
night
had
frightened
the
evil
spirits
so
effectually
that
they
had
had
no
ghostly
visitors
since
we
came
i
was
camping
out
one
night
in
the
bush
with
some
coast
natives
at
a
time
when
a
number
of
the
natives
of
the
interior
were
hunting
in
the
neighbourhood
noticing
that
the
men
with
me
did
not
go
to
sleep
i
asked
if
they
were
afraid
of
the
mountain
men
no
they
replied
but
the
whole
plain
is
full
of
the
spirits
who
come
with
all
calamities
are
attributed
to
the
power
and
malice
of
these
evil
spirits
drought
and
famine
storm
and
flood
disease
and
death
are
all
supposed
to
be
brought
by
vata
and
his
the
inhabitants
of
timor
an
island
to
the
of
new
guinea
revere
the
lord
of
heaven
the
sun
the
mistress
of
the
earth
and
the
spirits
of
the
dead
these
last
dwell
some
with
the
mistress
of
the
earth
under
ground
others
on
graves
others
in
stones
and
springs
and
woods
some
on
mountains
and
some
in
the
habitations
of
their
kinsfolk
where
they
take
up
their
abode
in
the
middle
of
the
principal
post
of
the
house
or
in
copper
cymbals
in
swords
and
pikes
others
again
assume
the
shape
of
pigs
and
deer
and
bees
men
who
have
fallen
in
battle
love
especially
to
turn
into
bees
that
they
may
roam
over
the
earth
at
will
the
ghosts
who
reside
with
the
mistress
of
the
earth
are
male
and
female
and
their
offspring
swarm
by
myriads
in
the
air
so
that
the
people
think
you
can
not
stir
without
striking
against
one
of
them
according
to
their
whim
of
the
moment
the
ghosts
are
good
or
all
diseases
which
are
not
due
to
infection
or
transmitted
by
inheritance
are
ascribed
to
the
mistress
of
the
earth
to
the
ghosts
and
to
their
wicked
offspring
who
inflict
them
as
punishments
for
insults
and
injuries
for
insufficient
food
for
the
killing
of
deer
and
of
wild
pigs
in
which
the
ghosts
take
up
their
abode
temporarily
and
also
for
the
sale
of
cymbals
swords
and
pikes
in
which
a
ghost
had
the
natives
of
amboyna
think
that
woods
mountains
trees
stones
indeed
the
whole
universe
is
inhabited
by
a
multitude
of
spirits
of
whom
many
are
the
souls
of
the
in
bolang
mongondo
a
district
of
celebes
all
calamities
great
and
small
of
whatever
kind
and
by
whatever
name
they
are
called
that
befall
men
and
animals
villages
gardens
and
so
forth
are
attributed
to
evil
or
angry
spirits
the
superstition
is
indescribably
great
the
smallest
wound
the
least
indisposition
the
most
trifling
adversity
in
the
field
at
the
fishing
on
a
journey
or
what
not
is
believed
by
the
natives
to
be
traceable
to
the
anger
of
their
ancestors
the
superstition
cripples
every
effort
to
remedy
the
calamities
except
by
sacrifice
there
is
perhaps
no
country
the
inhabitants
of
which
know
so
little
about
simples
as
bolang
mongondo
what
a
native
of
bolang
mongondo
calls
medicine
is
nothing
but
sacrifice
magic
and
talismans
and
the
method
of
curing
a
sick
man
always
consists
in
the
use
of
magic
or
in
the
propitiation
of
angry
ancestral
spirits
by
means
of
offerings
or
in
the
banishment
of
evil
spirits
the
application
of
one
or
other
of
these
three
methods
depends
again
on
the
decision
of
the
sorcerer
who
plays
a
great
part
in
every
case
of
in
the
island
of
bali
all
the
attention
paid
to
the
sick
has
its
root
solely
in
the
excessive
superstition
of
these
islanders
which
leads
them
to
impute
every
unpleasantness
in
life
every
adversity
to
the
influence
of
evil
spirits
or
of
men
who
are
in
some
way
in
league
with
them
the
belief
in
witches
and
wizards
is
everywhere
great
in
the
indies
but
perhaps
nowhere
is
it
so
universal
and
so
strong
as
in
in
java
we
are
told
it
is
not
merely
great
shady
trees
that
are
believed
to
be
the
abode
of
spirits
in
other
places
also
where
the
vital
energy
of
nature
manifests
itself
strikingly
and
impressively
a
feeling
of
veneration
is
stirred
as
on
the
in
deep
woods
on
steep
mountain
sides
all
such
spots
are
supposed
to
be
the
abode
of
spirits
of
various
kinds
whose
mighty
power
is
regarded
with
reverence
and
awe
whose
anger
is
dreaded
and
whose
favour
is
hoped
for
but
wherever
they
dwell
whether
in
scenes
of
loveliness
that
move
the
heart
or
in
spots
that
affect
the
mind
with
fright
and
horror
the
nature
and
disposition
of
these
spirits
appear
not
to
differ
they
are
a
source
of
fear
and
anxiety
in
the
one
case
just
as
much
as
in
the
other
to
none
of
them
did
i
ever
hear
moral
qualities
ascribed
they
are
mighty
they
are
potentates
and
therefore
it
is
well
with
him
who
has
their
favour
and
ill
with
him
who
has
it
not
this
holds
true
of
them
the
number
of
the
spirits
is
innumerable
and
inconceivable
all
the
phenomena
of
nature
which
we
trace
to
fixed
laws
and
constant
forces
are
supposed
by
the
javanese
to
be
wrought
by
the
natives
of
the
valley
of
the
barito
in
borneo
hold
that
the
air
is
filled
with
countless
spirits
every
object
has
such
a
spirit
which
watches
over
it
and
seeks
to
defend
it
from
danger
it
is
these
spirits
especially
that
bring
sickness
and
misfortune
on
men
and
for
that
reason
offerings
are
often
made
to
them
and
also
to
the
powerful
angels
whereas
the
supreme
god
the
original
fountain
of
all
good
is
of
the
battas
or
bataks
of
sumatra
we
are
told
that
the
of
their
religious
mood
is
fear
of
the
unknown
powers
a
childish
feeling
of
dependence
the
outcome
of
a
belief
in
supernatural
influences
to
which
man
is
constantly
exposed
in
wonders
and
witchcraft
which
hamper
his
free
action
they
feel
themselves
continually
surrounded
by
unseen
beings
and
dependent
on
them
for
every
misfortune
bespeaks
the
of
the
hostile
spirits
the
whole
world
is
a
of
demons
and
most
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
are
an
expression
of
their
power
the
only
means
of
remedying
or
counteracting
their
baleful
influence
is
to
drive
away
the
spirits
by
means
of
certain
words
as
well
as
by
the
use
of
amulets
and
the
offering
of
sacrifices
to
the
guardian
to
the
same
effect
another
authority
on
the
religion
of
the
battas
remarks
that
the
common
man
has
only
a
very
dim
and
misty
notion
of
his
triune
god
and
troubles
himself
far
more
about
the
legions
of
spirits
which
people
the
whole
world
around
him
and
against
which
he
must
always
be
protected
by
magic
again
speaking
of
the
same
people
a
dutch
missionary
observes
that
if
there
is
still
any
adherent
of
rousseau
s
superficial
theories
about
the
idyllically
happy
and
careless
life
of
people
in
a
state
of
nature
he
ought
to
come
and
spend
a
little
time
among
the
bataks
and
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
he
would
soon
be
convinced
of
the
hollowness
and
falsehood
of
these
phrases
and
would
learn
to
feel
a
deep
compassion
for
human
beings
living
in
perpetual
fear
of
evil
the
religion
of
the
nicobar
islanders
is
an
undisguised
animism
and
the
whole
of
their
very
frequent
and
elaborate
ceremonies
and
festivals
are
aimed
at
exorcising
and
scaring
spirits
devils
as
they
have
been
taught
to
call
them
fear
of
spirits
and
ghosts
is
the
guide
to
all
ceremonies
and
the
life
of
the
people
is
largely
taken
up
with
ceremonials
and
feasts
of
all
kinds
these
are
usually
held
at
night
and
whether
directly
religious
or
merely
convivial
seem
all
to
have
an
origin
in
the
overmastering
fear
of
spirits
that
possesses
the
nicobarese
it
has
so
far
proved
ineradicable
for
two
centuries
of
varied
and
almost
continuous
missionary
effort
has
had
no
appreciable
effect
on
the
mantras
an
aboriginal
race
of
the
malay
peninsula
find
or
put
a
spirit
everywhere
in
the
air
they
breathe
in
the
land
they
cultivate
in
the
forests
they
inhabit
in
the
trees
they
cut
down
in
the
caves
of
the
rocks
according
to
them
the
demon
is
the
cause
of
everything
that
turns
out
ill
if
they
are
sick
a
demon
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
if
an
accident
happens
it
is
still
the
spirit
who
is
at
work
thereupon
the
demon
takes
the
name
of
the
particular
evil
of
which
he
is
supposed
to
be
the
cause
hence
the
demon
being
assumed
as
the
author
of
every
ill
all
their
superstitions
resolve
themselves
into
enchantments
and
spells
to
appease
the
evil
spirit
to
render
mild
and
tractable
the
fiercest
to
the
mind
of
the
kamtchatkan
every
corner
of
earth
and
heaven
seemed
full
of
spirits
whom
he
revered
and
dreaded
more
than
god
in
india
from
the
earliest
times
down
to
the
present
day
the
real
religion
of
the
common
folk
appears
always
to
have
been
a
belief
in
a
vast
multitude
of
spirits
of
whom
many
if
not
most
are
mischievous
and
harmful
as
in
europe
beneath
a
superficial
layer
of
christianity
a
faith
in
magic
and
witchcraft
in
ghosts
and
goblins
has
always
survived
and
even
flourished
among
the
weak
and
ignorant
so
it
has
been
and
so
it
is
in
the
east
brahmanism
buddhism
islam
may
come
and
go
but
the
belief
in
magic
and
demons
remains
unshaken
through
them
all
and
if
we
may
judge
of
the
future
from
the
past
is
likely
to
survive
the
rise
and
fall
of
other
historical
religions
for
the
great
faiths
of
the
world
just
in
so
far
as
they
are
the
outcome
of
superior
intelligence
of
purer
morality
of
extraordinary
fervour
of
aspiration
after
the
ideal
fail
to
touch
and
move
the
common
man
they
make
claims
upon
his
intellect
and
his
heart
to
which
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
capable
of
responding
the
philosophy
they
teach
is
too
abstract
the
morality
they
inculcate
too
exalted
for
him
the
keener
minds
embrace
the
new
philosophy
the
more
generous
spirits
are
fired
by
the
new
morality
and
as
the
world
is
led
by
such
men
their
faith
sooner
or
later
becomes
the
professed
faith
of
the
multitude
yet
with
the
common
herd
who
compose
the
great
bulk
of
every
people
the
new
religion
is
accepted
only
in
outward
show
because
it
is
impressed
upon
them
by
their
natural
leaders
whom
they
can
not
choose
but
follow
they
yield
a
dull
assent
to
it
with
their
lips
but
in
their
heart
they
never
really
abandon
their
old
superstitions
in
these
they
cherish
a
faith
such
as
they
can
not
repose
in
the
creed
which
they
nominally
profess
and
to
these
in
the
trials
and
emergencies
of
life
they
have
recourse
as
to
infallible
remedies
when
the
promises
of
the
higher
faith
have
failed
them
as
indeed
such
promises
are
apt
to
do
to
establish
for
india
in
particular
the
truth
of
the
propositions
which
i
have
just
advanced
it
may
be
enough
to
cite
the
evidence
of
two
writers
of
high
authority
one
of
whom
deals
with
the
most
ancient
form
of
indian
religion
known
to
us
while
the
other
describes
the
popular
religion
of
the
hindoos
at
the
present
day
according
to
the
creed
of
the
vedic
ages
says
professor
oldenberg
the
whole
world
in
which
man
lives
is
animated
sky
and
earth
mountain
forest
trees
and
beasts
the
earthly
water
and
the
heavenly
water
of
the
clouds
is
filled
with
living
spiritual
beings
who
are
either
friendly
or
hostile
to
mankind
unseen
or
embodied
in
visible
form
hosts
of
spirits
surround
and
hover
about
human
habitations
or
misshapen
goblins
souls
of
dead
friends
and
souls
of
foes
sometimes
as
kindly
guardians
oftener
as
bringing
disease
and
misfortune
sucking
the
blood
and
strength
of
the
living
a
soul
is
attributed
even
to
the
object
fashioned
by
human
hands
whose
functions
are
felt
to
be
friendly
or
hostile
the
warrior
pays
his
devotion
to
the
divine
the
divine
arrow
the
drum
the
ploughman
to
the
ploughshare
the
gambler
to
the
dice
the
sacrificer
about
whom
naturally
we
have
the
most
exact
information
reveres
the
stone
that
presses
out
the
juice
of
the
soma
the
straw
on
which
the
gods
recline
the
post
to
which
the
sacrificial
victim
is
bound
and
the
divine
doors
through
which
the
gods
come
forth
to
enjoy
the
sacrifice
at
one
time
the
beings
in
whose
presence
man
feels
himself
are
regarded
by
him
as
really
endowed
with
souls
at
another
time
in
harmony
with
a
more
advanced
conception
of
the
world
they
are
imagined
as
substances
or
fluids
invested
with
beneficent
or
maleficent
properties
belief
oscillates
to
and
fro
between
the
one
mode
of
thought
and
the
other
the
art
of
turning
to
account
the
operations
of
these
animated
beings
the
play
of
these
substances
and
forces
is
magic
rather
than
worship
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
the
foundations
of
this
faith
and
of
this
magic
are
an
inheritance
from
the
remotest
past
from
a
period
to
put
it
shortly
of
shamanistic
faith
in
spirits
and
souls
of
shamanistic
magic
such
a
period
has
been
passed
through
by
the
forefathers
of
the
race
as
well
as
by
other
coming
down
to
the
hindoos
of
the
present
day
we
find
that
their
attitude
towards
the
spiritual
world
is
described
as
follows
by
professor
monier
williams
the
plain
fact
undoubtedly
is
that
the
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
india
are
from
the
cradle
to
the
victims
of
a
form
of
mental
disease
which
is
best
expressed
by
the
term
demonophobia
they
are
haunted
and
oppressed
by
a
perpetual
dread
of
demons
they
are
firmly
convinced
that
evil
spirits
of
all
kinds
from
malignant
fiends
to
merely
mischievous
imps
and
elves
are
ever
on
the
watch
to
harm
harass
and
torment
them
to
cause
plague
sickness
famine
and
disaster
to
impede
injure
and
mar
every
good
elsewhere
the
same
writer
has
expressed
the
same
view
somewhat
more
fully
in
fact
he
says
a
belief
in
every
kind
of
demoniacal
influence
has
always
been
from
the
earliest
times
an
essential
ingredient
in
hindu
religious
thought
the
idea
probably
had
its
origin
in
the
supposed
peopling
of
the
air
by
spiritual
personifications
or
companions
of
storm
and
tempest
certainly
no
one
who
has
ever
been
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
hindus
in
their
own
country
can
doubt
the
fact
that
the
worship
of
at
least
ninety
per
cent
of
the
people
of
india
in
the
present
day
is
a
worship
of
fear
not
that
the
existence
of
good
deities
presided
over
by
one
supreme
being
is
doubted
but
that
these
deities
are
believed
to
be
too
absolutely
good
to
need
propitiation
just
as
in
ancient
histories
of
the
slav
races
we
are
told
that
they
believed
in
a
white
god
and
a
black
god
but
paid
adoration
to
the
last
alone
having
as
they
supposed
nothing
to
apprehend
from
the
beneficence
of
the
first
or
white
deity
the
simple
truth
is
that
evil
of
all
kinds
difficulties
dangers
and
disasters
famines
diseases
pestilences
and
death
are
thought
by
an
ordinary
hindu
to
proceed
from
demons
or
more
properly
speaking
from
devils
and
from
devils
alone
these
malignant
beings
are
held
as
we
have
seen
to
possess
varying
degrees
of
rank
power
and
malevolence
some
aim
at
destroying
the
entire
world
and
threaten
the
sovereignty
of
the
gods
themselves
some
delight
in
killing
men
women
and
children
out
of
a
mere
thirst
for
human
blood
some
take
a
mere
mischievous
pleasure
in
tormenting
or
revel
in
the
infliction
of
sickness
injury
and
misfortune
all
make
it
their
business
to
mar
or
impede
the
progress
of
good
works
and
useful
it
would
be
easy
but
tedious
to
illustrate
in
detail
this
general
account
of
the
dread
of
demons
which
prevails
among
the
inhabitants
of
india
at
the
present
day
a
very
few
particular
statements
must
suffice
thus
we
are
told
that
the
oraons
a
dravidian
race
in
bengal
acknowledge
a
supreme
god
adored
as
dharmi
or
dharmesh
the
holy
one
who
is
manifest
in
the
sun
and
they
regard
dharmesh
as
a
perfectly
pure
beneficent
being
who
created
us
and
would
in
his
goodness
and
mercy
preserve
us
but
that
his
benevolent
designs
are
thwarted
by
malignant
spirits
whom
mortals
must
propitiate
as
dharmesh
can
not
or
does
not
interfere
if
the
spirit
of
evil
once
fastens
upon
us
it
is
therefore
of
no
use
to
pray
to
dharmesh
or
to
offer
sacrifices
to
him
so
though
acknowledged
recognised
and
reverenced
he
is
neglected
whilst
the
malignant
spirits
are
again
it
is
said
of
these
oraons
that
as
the
sole
object
of
their
religious
ceremonies
is
the
propitiation
of
the
demons
who
are
ever
thwarting
the
benevolent
intentions
of
dharmesh
they
have
no
notion
of
a
service
of
once
more
after
giving
a
list
of
oraon
demons
the
same
writer
goes
on
besides
this
superstitious
dread
of
the
spirits
above
named
the
oraon
s
imagination
tremblingly
wanders
in
a
world
of
ghosts
every
rock
road
river
and
grove
is
again
a
missionary
who
spent
many
years
among
the
kacharis
of
assam
tells
us
that
the
religion
of
the
kachári
race
is
distinctly
of
the
type
commonly
known
as
animistic
and
its
underlying
principle
is
characteristically
one
of
fear
or
dread
the
statement
fecit
certainly
holds
good
of
this
people
in
its
widest
and
strictest
sense
and
their
religion
thus
stands
in
very
marked
not
to
say
violent
contrast
with
the
teaching
of
the
faith
in
christ
in
the
typical
kachári
village
as
a
rule
neither
idol
nor
place
of
worship
is
to
be
found
but
to
the
kachári
mind
and
imagination
earth
air
and
sky
are
alike
peopled
with
a
vast
number
of
invisible
spiritual
beings
known
usually
as
all
possessing
powers
and
faculties
far
greater
than
those
of
man
and
almost
invariably
inclined
to
use
these
powers
for
malignant
and
malevolent
rather
than
benevolent
purposes
in
a
certain
stage
of
moral
and
spiritual
development
men
are
undoubtedly
influenced
far
more
by
what
they
fear
than
by
what
they
love
and
this
truth
certainly
applies
to
the
kachári
race
in
the
most
unqualified
again
the
siyins
who
inhabit
the
chin
hills
of
india
on
the
borders
of
burma
say
that
there
is
no
supreme
god
and
no
other
world
save
this
which
is
full
of
evil
spirits
who
inhabit
the
fields
infest
the
houses
and
haunt
the
jungles
these
spirits
must
be
propitiated
or
bribed
to
refrain
from
doing
the
particular
harm
of
which
each
is
capable
for
one
can
destroy
crops
another
can
make
women
barren
and
a
third
cause
a
lizard
to
enter
the
stomach
and
devour
the
like
most
mountaineers
the
people
of
sikhim
and
the
tibetans
are
in
every
nook
path
big
tree
rock
spring
waterfall
and
lake
there
lurks
a
devil
for
which
reason
few
individuals
will
venture
out
alone
after
dark
the
sky
the
ground
the
house
the
field
the
country
have
each
their
special
demons
and
sickness
is
always
attributed
to
malign
demoniacal
even
the
purest
of
all
the
lamaist
and
value
buddhism
chiefly
because
it
gives
them
the
over
the
devils
which
everywhere
vex
humanity
with
disease
and
disaster
and
whose
ferocity
weighs
heavily
on
the
lushais
of
assam
believe
in
a
beneficent
spirit
named
pathian
who
made
everything
but
troubles
himself
very
little
about
men
far
more
important
in
ordinary
life
are
the
numerous
demons
who
inhabit
every
stream
mountain
and
forest
and
are
all
malignant
to
their
agency
are
ascribed
all
the
illnesses
and
misfortunes
that
afflict
humanity
and
a
lushai
s
whole
life
is
spent
in
propitiating
them
it
is
the
sorcerer
who
knows
what
demon
is
causing
any
particular
trouble
and
it
is
he
who
can
prescribe
the
sort
of
sacrifice
which
will
appease
the
wrath
of
the
fiend
every
form
of
sickness
is
set
down
to
the
influence
of
some
demon
or
other
and
all
the
tales
about
these
spiritual
foes
begin
or
end
with
the
recurrent
phrase
there
was
much
sickness
in
our
in
travancore
the
minor
superstitions
connected
with
are
innumerable
they
enter
into
all
the
feelings
and
are
associated
with
the
whole
life
of
these
people
every
disease
accident
or
misfortune
is
attributed
to
the
agency
of
the
devils
and
great
caution
is
exercised
to
avoid
arousing
their
with
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
ceylon
we
are
told
that
the
fiends
which
they
conceive
to
be
hovering
around
them
are
without
number
every
disease
or
trouble
that
assails
them
is
produced
by
the
immediate
agency
of
the
demons
sent
to
punish
them
while
on
the
other
hand
every
blessing
or
success
comes
directly
from
the
hands
of
the
beneficent
and
supreme
god
to
screen
themselves
from
the
power
of
the
inferior
deities
who
are
all
represented
as
wicked
spirits
and
whose
power
is
by
no
means
irresistible
they
wear
amulets
of
various
descriptions
and
employ
a
variety
of
charms
and
spells
to
ward
off
the
influence
of
witchcraft
and
enchantments
by
which
they
think
themselves
beset
on
all
it
is
probable
that
by
degrees
intercourse
with
europeans
will
entirely
do
away
these
superstitious
fears
as
the
cinglese
of
the
towns
have
already
made
considerable
progress
in
subduing
their
gloomy
apprehensions
not
so
the
poor
wretched
peasants
who
inhabit
the
more
mountainous
parts
of
the
country
and
live
at
a
distance
from
our
settlements
these
unhappy
people
have
never
for
a
moment
their
minds
free
from
the
terror
of
those
demons
who
seem
perpetually
to
hover
around
them
their
imaginations
are
so
disturbed
by
such
ideas
that
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
many
driven
to
madness
from
this
cause
several
cinglese
lunatics
have
fallen
under
my
own
observation
and
upon
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
which
had
deprived
them
of
their
reason
i
universally
found
that
their
wretched
state
was
to
be
traced
solely
to
the
excess
of
their
superstitious
fears
the
spirits
of
the
wicked
subordinate
demons
are
the
chief
objects
of
fear
among
the
ceylonese
and
impress
their
minds
with
much
more
awe
than
the
more
powerful
divinities
who
dispense
blessings
among
them
they
indeed
think
that
their
country
is
in
a
particular
manner
delivered
over
to
the
dominion
of
evil
in
eastern
as
well
as
southern
asia
the
same
view
of
nature
as
pervaded
by
a
multitude
of
spirits
mostly
mischievous
and
malignant
has
survived
the
nominal
establishment
of
a
higher
faith
in
spite
of
their
long
conversion
their
sincere
belief
in
and
their
pure
form
of
buddhism
which
expressly
repudiates
and
forbids
such
worship
the
burmans
and
taleins
or
mons
have
in
a
great
measure
kept
their
ancient
spirit
or
demon
worship
with
the
taleins
this
is
more
especially
the
case
indeed
with
the
country
population
of
pegu
the
worship
or
it
should
rather
be
said
the
propitiation
of
the
nats
or
spirits
enters
into
every
act
of
their
ordinary
life
and
buddha
s
doctrine
seems
kept
for
sacred
days
and
their
visits
to
the
kyoung
monastery
or
to
the
or
as
another
writer
puts
it
the
propitiating
of
the
nats
is
a
question
of
daily
concern
to
the
lower
class
burman
while
the
worship
at
the
pagoda
is
only
thought
of
once
a
week
for
the
nat
may
prove
destructive
and
hostile
at
any
time
whereas
the
acquisition
of
merit
at
the
pagoda
is
a
thing
which
may
be
set
about
in
a
way
and
at
proper
and
convenient
but
the
term
worship
we
are
informed
hardly
conveys
a
proper
notion
of
the
attitude
of
the
burmese
towards
the
nats
or
spirits
even
the
karens
and
kachins
who
have
no
other
form
of
belief
do
not
regard
them
otherwise
than
as
malevolent
beings
who
must
be
looked
up
to
with
fear
and
propitiated
by
regular
offerings
they
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
nats
all
they
seek
is
to
be
let
alone
the
bamboo
pipes
of
spirit
the
bones
of
sacrificial
animals
the
hatchets
swords
spears
bows
and
arrows
that
line
the
way
to
a
kachin
village
are
placed
there
not
with
the
idea
of
attracting
the
spirits
but
of
preventing
them
from
coming
right
among
the
houses
in
search
of
their
requirements
if
they
want
to
drink
the
rice
spirit
has
been
poured
out
and
the
bamboo
stoup
is
there
in
evidence
of
the
libation
the
skulls
of
oxen
pigs
and
the
feathers
of
fowls
show
that
there
has
been
no
stint
of
meat
offerings
should
the
nats
wax
quarrelsome
and
wish
to
fight
there
are
the
axes
and
dahs
with
which
to
commence
the
fray
only
let
them
be
grateful
and
leave
their
trembling
worshippers
in
peace
and
similarly
the
lao
or
laosians
of
siam
though
they
are
nominally
buddhists
and
have
monks
and
pagodas
with
images
of
buddha
are
said
to
pay
more
respect
to
spirits
or
demons
than
to
these
idols
the
desire
to
propitiate
the
good
spirits
and
to
exorcise
the
bad
ones
is
the
prevailing
influence
upon
the
life
of
a
laosian
with
evil
spirits
to

of
him
to

of
him
in

of
him
behind
him
all
round
him
his
mind
is
haunted
with
a
perpetual
desire
to
make
terms
with
them
and
to
ensure
the
assistance
of
the
great
buddha
so
that
he
may
preserve
both
body
and
soul
from
the
hands
of
the

of
the
demons
who
are
in
hell
the
siamese
recognise
another
sort
of
devils
diffused
in
the
air
they
call
them
these
are
they
say
the
demons
who
do
harm
to
men
and
who
appear
sometimes
in
horrible
shapes
they
put
down
to
the
account
of
these
malign
spirits
all
the
calamities
which
happen
in
the
world
if
a
mother
has
lost
a
child
it
is
a

done

ill
turn

a

is
at
the

of

invoke
him
and
make
him
offerings
which
they
hang
up
in
desert
as
to
the
thay
a
widely
spread
race
of
a
french
missionary
writes
as
follows
it
may
be
said
that
the
thay
lives
in
constant
intercourse
with
the
invisible
world
there
is
hardly
an
act
of
his
life
which
is
not
regulated
by
some
religious
belief
there
are
two
worships
the
worship
of
the
spirits
and
the
worship
of
the
dead
which
however
are
scarcely
distinguishable
from
each
other
since
the
dead
become
spirits
by
the
mere
fact
of
their
death
his
simple
imagination
represents
to
him
the
world
of
spirits
as
a
sort
of
double
of
the
state
of
things
here
below
at
the
summit
is
po

just
as
they
did

in
their
life
on
earth
he
has
to

a
goddess
me
bau
besides
these
heavenly
spirits
the
thay
reckons
a
multitude
of
others
under
the
name
of
his
science
being
not
very
extensive
many
things
seem
extraordinary
to
him
if
he
can
not
explain
a
certain
natural
phenomenon
his
perplexity
does
not
last
long
it
is
the
work
of
a
he
says
and
his
priests
take
care
not
to
dissuade
him
hence
he
sees
spirits
everywhere
there
are
on
the
steep
mountains
in
the
deep
woods
the
who
by
night
on
the
mountain
imitate
the
rain
and
the
storms
and
leave
no
trace
of
their
passage
if
they
shew
themselves
they
appear
in
the
form
of
gigantic
animals
and
cause
terrible
stomach
troubles
such
as
diarrhœa
dysentery
and
so
on
the
large
animals
of
the
forest
wild
oxen
and
buffaloes
rhinoceroses
elephants
and
so
on
have
their
guardian
spirits
hence
the
prudent
hunter
learns
at
the
outset
to
exorcise
them
in
order
that
when
he
has
killed
these
animals
he
may
be
able
to
cut
them
up
and
eat
their
flesh
without
having
to
fear
the
vengeance
of
their
invisible
guardian
spirits
also
guard
the
clearings
whither
the
deer
come
by
night
to
drink
the
hunter
should
sacrifice
a
fowl
to
them
from
time
to
time
if
he
would
bring
down
his
game
with
ease
the
gun
itself
has
a
spirit
who
looks
to
it
that
the
powder
explodes
in
short
the
thay
can
not
take
a
single
step
without
meeting
a
spirit
on
the
thus
the
life
of
the
thay
seems
regulated
down
to
its
smallest
details
by
custom
founded
on
his
belief
in
the
spirits
spirits
perpetually
watch
him
ready
to
punish
his
negligences
and
he
is
afraid
fear
is
not
only
for
him
the
beginning
of
wisdom
it
is
the
whole
of
his
wisdom
love
has
only
a
very
moderate
place
in
it
even
the
respect
in
which
he
holds
his
dead
and
the
honours
which
he
pays
them
on
various
occasions
seem
to
be
dominated
by
a
superstitious
fear
it
seems
that
the
sacrifices
which
he
offers
to
them
aim
rather
at
averting
from
himself
the
evils
which
he
dreads
than
at
honouring
worthily
the
memory
of
his
deceased
kinsfolk
and
at
paying
them
the
tribute
of
his
affection
and
gratitude
once
they
sleep
their
last
sleep
yonder
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
trees
of
the
forest
none
goes
to
shed
a
tear
and
murmur
a
prayer
on
their
grave
nothing
but
calamity
suffices
to
rescue
them
from
the
oblivion
into
which
they
had
fallen
in
the
memory
of
the
the
dogma
prevailing
in
china
from
the
earliest
times
that
the
universe
is
filled
in
all
its
parts
with
and
naturally
implies
that
devils
and
demons
must
also
swarm
about
the
homes
of
men
in
numbers
inestimable
it
is
in
fact
an
axiom
which
constantly
comes
out
in
conversing
with
the
people
that
they
haunt
every
frequented
and
lonely
spot
and
that
no
place
exists
where
man
is
safe
from
the
worship
and
propitiation
of
the
gods
which
is
the
main
part
of
china
s
religion
has
no
higher
purpose
than
that
of
inducing
the
gods
to
protect
man
against
the
world
of
evil
or
by
descending
among
men
to
drive
spectres
away
by
their
intimidating
presence
this
cult
implies
invocation
of
happiness
but
as
happiness
merely
means
absence
of
misfortune
which
the
spectres
cause
such
a
cult
is
tantamount
to
the
disarming
of
spectres
by
means
of
the
gods
taoism
may
then
actually
be
defined
as
exorcising
polytheism
a
cult
of
the
gods
with
which
eastern
asiatic
imagination
has
filled
the
universe
connected
with
a
highly
developed
system
of
magic
consisting
for
a
great
part
in
exorcism
this
cult
and
magic
is
of
course
principally
in
the
hands
of
priests
but
besides
the
lay
world
enslaved
to
the
intense
belief
in
the
perilous
omnipresence
of
spectres
is
engaged
every
day
in
a
restless
defensive
and
offensive
war
against
those
in
corea
among
the
reasons
which
render
the
shaman
a
necessity
are
these

korean
belief

peopled
by

they
haunt
every
umbrageous

in

on

by

they
are

by
of
and
it
has
been
well
said
that
their
ubiquity
is
an
unholy
travesty
of
the
divine
omnipresence
this
belief
and
it
seems
to
be
the
only
one
he
has
keeps
the
korean
in
a
perpetual
state
of
nervous
apprehension
it
surrounds
him
with
indefinite
terrors
and
it
may
truly
be
said
of
him
that
he
passes
the
time
of
his
sojourning
here
in
every
korean
home
is
subject
to
demons
here
there
and
everywhere
they
touch
the
korean
at
every
point
in
life
making
his
depend
on
a
continual
series
of
acts
of
propitiation

they
avenge
every
omission
with
merciless
severity

of
bondage
from

to

attribute
every

bad

transaction
official
malevolence
illness
whether
sudden
or
prolonged
pecuniary
misfortune
and
loss
of
power
or
position
are
due
to
the
malignity
of
demons
it
is
over
such
evils
that
the
shaman
is
supposed
to
have
power
and
to
be
able
to
terminate
them
by
magical
rites
he
being
possessed
by
a
powerful
demon
whose
strength
he
is
able
to
of
the
nomadic
koryaks
of
asia
it
is
said
that
all
their
religious
customs
have
only
reference
to
the
evil
spirits
of
the
earth
their
religion
is
thus
a
cunning
diplomacy
or
negotiation
with
these
spirits
in
order
as
far
as
possible
to
deter
them
from
actions
which
would
be
injurious
to
men
everywhere
on
every
mountain
in
the
sea
by
the
rivers
in
the
forest
and
on
the
plains
their
fancy
sees
demons
lurking
whom
they
picture
to
themselves
as
purely
malignant
and
very
greedy
hence
the
frequent
offerings
by
which
they
seek
to
satisfy
the
greed
of
these
insatiable
beings
and
to
redeem
that
which
they
value
and
hold
dear
those
of
the
people
who
are
believed
to
be
able
to
divine
most
easily
the
wishes
of
the
evil
ones
and
who
enjoy
their
favour
to
a
certain
extent
are
called
shamans
and
the
religious
ceremonies
which
they
perform
are
shamanism
in
every
case
the
shamans
must
give
their
advice
as
to
how
the
devils
are
to
be
got
rid
of
and
must
reveal
the
wishes
of
the
as
to
these
demons
of
the
earth
who
infest
the
koryaks
we
are
told
that
when
visiting
the
houses
to
cause
diseases
and
to
kill
people
they
enter
from
under
ground
through
the
and
return
the
same
way
it
happens
at
times
that
they
steal
people
and
carry
them
away
they
are
invisible
to
human
beings
and
are
capable
of
changing
their
size
they
are
sometimes
so
numerous
in
houses
that
they
sit
on
the
people
and
fill
up
all
corners
with
hammers
and
axes
they
knock
people
over
their
heads
thus
causing
headaches
they
bite
and
cause
swellings
they
shoot
invisible
arrows
which
stick
in
the
body
causing
death
if
a
shaman
does
not
pull
them
out
in
time
the
demons
tear
out
pieces
of
flesh
from
people
thus
causing
sores
and
wounds
to
form
on
their
the
gilyaks
of
the
amoor
valley
in
eastern
asia
believe
that
besides
the
gods
there
are
evil
supernatural
beings
who
do
him
harm
they
are
devils
called
these
beings
appear
in
the
most
varied
forms
and
are
distinguished
according
to
the
degree
of
their
harmfulness
they
appear
now
in
the
form
of
a
gilyak
now
in
the
form
of
an
animal
from
a
bear
down
to
a
toad
and
a
lizard
they
exist
on
the
land
and
in
the
sea
under
the
earth
and
in
the
sky
some
of
them
form
special
tribes
of
treacherous
beings
whose
essential
nature
it
is
to
be
destructive
others
are
isolated
individuals
ruined
beings
lost
sons
of
families
of
beneficent
beings
who
are
exceptional
in
their
hostility
to
man
the
former
class
are
naturally
the
most
dangerous
some
are
wholly
occupied
in
robbing
the
gilyak
on
the
road
the
spirits
of
others
empty
his
barns
his
traps
his
pitfalls
and
so
on
lastly
there
are
such
also
the
most
dreadful
of
all
who
lie
in
wait
for
his
life
and
bring
sickness
and
death
were
there
no
such
beings
men
would
not
die
a
natural
death
is
impossible
death
is
the
result
of
the
wiles
of
these
treacherous
in
the
more
westerly
parts
of
the
old
world
the
same
belief
in
the
omnipresence
and
mischievous
power
of
spirits
has
prevailed
from
antiquity
to
the
present
day
if
we
may
judge
from
the
fragments
of
their
literature
which
have
been
deciphered
few
people
seem
to
have
suffered
more
from
the
persistent
assaults
of
demons
than
the
ancient
babylonians
and
assyrians
and
the
evil
spirits
that
preyed
on
them
were
of
a
peculiarly
cruel
and
malignant
sort
even
the
gods
themselves
were
not
exempt
from
their
attacks
these
baleful
beings
lurked
in
solitary
places
in
graves
in
the
shadow
of
ruins
and
on
the
tops
of
mountains
they
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
in
the
holes
and
dens
of
the
earth
they
issued
from
the
lower
parts
of
the
ground
nothing
could
resist
them
in
heaven
above
nothing
could
withstand
them
on
earth
below
they
roamed
the
streets
they
leaped
from
house
to
house
the
high
and
thick
fences
they
penetrated
like
a
flood
the
door
could
not
stay
them
nor
the
bolt
make
them
turn
back
they
glided
through
the
door
like
a
serpent
they
pierced
through
the
planks
like
the
wind
there
was
no
place
however
small
which
they
could
not
invade
none
so
large
that
they
could
not
fill
and
their
wickedness
was
equal
to
their
power
they
are
wicked
they
are
wicked
says
an
incantation
no
prayers
could
move
them
no
supplications
could
make
them
relent
for
they
knew
no
pity
they
hearkened
not
to
reason
they
knew
no
troth
to
them
all
manner
of
evil
was
ascribed
their
presence
was
felt
not
only
in
the
terrible
winds
that
swept
the
land
in
the
fevers
bred
of
the
marshes
and
in
the
diseases
engendered
by
the
damp
heat
of
summer
all
the
petty
annoyances
of
sudden
fall
an
unlucky
word
a
headache
a
paltry
set
down
to
the
agency
of
fiends
and
all
the
fierce
emotions
that
rend
the
hate
jealousy
and
equally
the
work
of
these
invisible
tormentors
men
and
women
stood
in
constant
danger
of
them
they
tore
the
wife
from
the
bosom
of
her
husband
the
son
from
the
knees
of
his
father
they
ate
the
flesh
and
drank
the
blood
of
men
they
prevented
them
from
sleeping
or
taking
food
and
to
adopt
a
metaphor
from
one
of
the
texts
they
ground
the
country
like
almost
every
part
of
the
human
frame
was
menaced
by
a
special
fiend
one
demon
assailed
the
head
another
the
neck
another
the
hips
and
so
on
they
bound
a
man
s
hands
they
fettered
his
feet
they
spat
poison
and
gall
on
him
day
and
night
must
he
wander
without
rest
sighs
and
lamentations
were
his
food
they
attacked
even
the
animals
they
drove
doves
from
their
dovecotes
and
swallows
from
their
nests
they
smote
the
bull
and
the
ass
they
pursued
the
cattle
to
their
stalls
they
lodged
with
the
horses
in
the
stable
they
caused
the
to
miscarry
and
the
young
ass
at
its
mother
s
dugs
to
pine
away
even
lifeless
things
could
be
possessed
by
them
for
there
were
demons
that
rushed
against
houses
and
took
walls
by
storm
that
shut
themselves
up
in
doors
and
hid
themselves
under
bolts
indeed
they
threatened
the
whole
world
with
destruction
and
there
was
none
that
could
deliver
from
them
save
only
the
mighty
god
marduk
in
the
opinion
of
the
ancient
egyptians
there
were
good
spirits
as
well
as
bad
but
the
of
the
practically
ignores
the
former
and
its
magical
formulae
were
directed
entirely
against
the
operations
of
evil
spirits
though
naturally
of
a
gay
and
disposition
the
egyptian
must
have
lived
in
a
perpetual
state
of
fear
of
spirits
of
all
kinds
spirits
of
calamity
disease
and
sickness
spirits
of
angry
gods
and
ancestors
and
above
all
the
spirit
of
death
his
imagination
filled
the
world
with
spirits
whose
acts
seemed
to
him
to
be
generally
malevolent
and
his
magical
and
religious
literature
and
his
amulets
testify
to
the
very
real
terror
with
which
he
regarded
his
future
existence
in
the
world
of
spirits
escape
from
such
spirits
was
impossible
for
they
could
not
in
modern
egypt
the
jinn
a
class
of
spiritual
beings
intermediate
between
angels
and
men
are
believed
to
pervade
the
solid
matter
of
the
earth
as
well
as
the
firmament
and
they
inhabit
rivers
ruined
houses
wells
baths
ovens
and
so
forth
so
thickly
do
they
swarm
that
in
pouring
water
or
other
liquids
on
the
ground
an
egyptian
will
commonly
exclaim
or
mutter
thereby
asking
the
permission
or
craving
the
pardon
of
any
jinn
who
might
chance
to
be
there
and
who
might
otherwise
resent
being
suddenly
soused
with
water
or
unsavoury
fluids
so
too
when
people
light
a
fire
let
down
a
bucket
into
a
well
or
perform
other
necessary
functions
they
will
say
permission
or
permission
ye
blessed
again
in
egypt
it
is
not
considered
proper
to
sweep
out
a
house
at
night
lest
in
doing
so
you
should
knock
against
a
jinnee
who
might
avenge
the
insult
the
earliest
of
the
greek
philosophers
thales
held
that
the
world
is
full
of
gods
or
spirits
and
the
same
primitive
creed
was
expounded
by
one
of
the
latest
pagan
thinkers
of
antiquity
porphyry
declared
that
demons
appeared
in
the
likeness
of
animals
that
every
house
and
every
body
was
full
of
them
and
that
forms
of
ceremonial
purification
such
as
beating
the
air
and
so
forth
had
no
other
object
but
that
of
driving
away
the
importunate
swarms
of
these
invisible
but
dangerous
beings
he
explained
that
evil
spirits
delighted
in
food
especially
in
blood
and
impurities
that
they
settled
like
flies
on
us
at
meals
and
that
they
could
only
be
kept
at
a
distance
by
ceremonial
observances
which
were
directed
not
to
pleasing
the
gods
but
simply
and
solely
to
beating
off
devils
his
theory
of
religious
purification
seems
faithfully
to
reflect
the
creed
of
the
savage
on
this
subject
but
a
philosopher
is
perhaps
the
last
person
whom
we
should
expect
to
find
acting
as
a
mirror
of
savagery
it
is
less
surprising
to
meet
with
the
same
venerable
doctrine
the
same
superstition
in
the
mouth
of
a
mediaeval
abbot
for
we
know
that
a
belief
in
devils
has
the
authority
of
the
founder
of
christianity
and
is
sanctioned
by
the
teaching
of
the
church
no
esquimau
on
the
frozen
shores
of
labrador
no
indian
in
the
sweltering
forests
of
guiana
no
cowering
hindoo
in
the
jungles
of
bengal
could
well
have
a
more
constant
and
abiding
sense
of
the
presence
of
malignant
demons
everywhere
about
him
than
had
abbot
richalm
who
ruled
over
the
cistercian
monastery
of
schönthal
in
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
curious
work
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
he
set
forth
how
he
was
daily
and
hourly
infested
by
devils
whom
though
he
could
not
see
he
heard
and
to
whom
he
imputed
all
the
ailments
of
his
flesh
and
all
the
frailties
of
his
spirit
if
he
felt
squeamish
he
was
sure
that
the
feeling
was
wrought
in
him
by
demoniacal
agency
if
puckers
appeared
on
his
nose
if
his
lower
lip
drooped
the
devils
had
again
to
answer
for
it
a
cough
a
cold
in
the
head
a
hawking
and
spitting
could
have
none
but
a
supernatural
and
devilish
origin
if
pacing
in
his
orchard
on
a
sunny
autumn
morning
the
portly
abbot
stooped
to
pick
up
the
mellow
fruit
that
had
fallen
in
the
night
the
blood
that
mounted
to
his
purple
face
was
sent
coursing
thither
by
his
invisible
foes
if
the
abbot
tossed
on
his
sleepless
couch
while
the
moonlight
streaming
in
at
the
window
cast
the
shadows
of
the
stanchions
like
black
bars
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
it
was
not
the
fleas
and
so
forth
that
kept
him
no
vermin
said
he
sagely
do
not
really
bite
they
seem
to
bite
indeed
but
it
is
all
the
work
of
devils
if
a
monk
snored
in
the
dormitory
the
unseemly
noise
proceeded
not
from
him
but
from
a
demon
lurking
in
his
person
especially
dangerous
were
the
demons
of
intoxication
these
subtle
fiends
commonly
lodged
at
the
taverns
in
the
neighbouring
town
but
on
feast
days
they
were
apt
to
slip
through
the
monastery
gates
and
glide
unseen
among
the
monks
seated
at
the
refectory
table
or
gathered
round
the
roaring
fire
on
the
hearth
while
the
bleak
wind
whistled
in
the
abbey
towers
and
a
more
generous
vintage
than
usual
glowed
and
sparkled
in
the
flagons
if
at
such
times
a
jolly
brother
appeared
to
the
carnal
eye
and
ear
to
grow
obstreperous
or
maudlin
to
speak
thick
or
to
reel
and
stagger
in
his
gait
be
sure
it
was
not
the
fiery
spirit
of
the
grape
that
moved
the
holy
man
it
was
a
spirit
of
quite
a
different
order
holding
such
views
on
the
source
of
all
bodily
and
mental
indisposition
it
was
natural
enough
that
the
abbot
should
prescribe
remedies
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
pharmacopœia
and
which
would
be
asked
for
in
vain
at
an
apothecary
s
they
consisted
chiefly
of
holy
water
and
the
sign
of
the
cross
this
last
he
recommended
particularly
as
a
specific
for
it
is
easy
to
suggest
that
the
abbot
s
wits
were
unsettled
that
he
suffered
from
hallucinations
and
so
forth
this
may
have
been
so
yet
a
mode
of
thought
like
his
seems
to
be
too
common
over
a
great
part
of
the
world
to
allow
us
to
attribute
it
purely
to
mental
derangement
in
the
middle
ages
when
the
general
level
of
knowledge
was
low
a
state
of
mind
like
richalm
s
may
have
been
shared
by
multitudes
even
of
educated
people
who
have
not
however
like
him
left
a
monument
of
their
folly
to
posterity
at
the
present
day
through
the
advance
and
spread
of
knowledge
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
any
person
of
acknowledged
sanity
holding
the
abbot
s
opinions
on
the
subject
of
demons
but
in
remote
parts
of
europe
a
little
research
might
shew
that
the
creed
of
porphyry
and
richalm
is
still
held
with
but
little
variation
by
the
mass
of
the
people
thus
we
are
told
that
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
believe
themselves
to
be
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
whole
legions
of
evil
spirits
these
devils
are
furthermore
assisted
by
another
sort
of
dragon
witches
and
goblins
and
to
each
of
these
dangerous
beings
are
ascribed
particular
powers
on
particular
days
and
at
certain
places
many
and
curious
are
therefore
the
means
by
which
the
roumanians
endeavour
to
counteract
these
baleful
influences
and
a
whole
complicated
study
about
as
laborious
as
the
mastering
of
an
unknown
language
is
required
in
order
to
teach
an
unfortunate
peasant
to
steer
clear
of
the
dangers
by
which
he
supposes
himself
to
be
beset
on
all
similar
beliefs
are
held
to
this
day
by
the
armenians
who
though
they
are
not
a
european
people
have
basked
in
the
light
of
christianity
from
a
time
when
central
and
northern
europe
was
still
plunged
in
heathen
darkness
all
the
activities
we
are
told
of
these
professing
christians
are
paralyzed
after
sunset
because
at
every
step
they
quake
with
fear
believing
that
the
evil
demons
are
everywhere
present
in
the
air
in
the
water
on
the
earth
by
day
the
evil
ones
are
under
the
earth
therefore
boiling
hot
water
may
not
be
poured
on
the
ground
because
it
sinks
into
the
earth
and
burns
the
feet
of
the
children
of
the
evil
spirits
but
in
the
evening
the
superstitious
armenian
will
pour
no
water
at
all
on
the
earth
because
the
evil
ones
are
everywhere
present
on
the
earth
some
of
them
are
walking
about
others
are
sitting
at
table
and
feasting
so
that
they
might
be
disturbed
by
the
pouring
out
of
water
and
they
would
take
vengeance
for
it
also
by
night
you
should
not
smite
the
ground
with
a
stick
nor
sweep
out
the
house
nor
remove
the
dung
from
the
stable
because
without
knowing
it
you
might
hit
the
evil
spirits
but
if
you
are
compelled
to
sweep
by
night
you
singe
the
tip
of
the
broom
so
as
to
frighten
the
evil
ones
away
in
time
you
must
not
go
out
at
night
bareheaded
for
the
evil
ones
would
smite
you
on
the
head
it
is
also
dangerous
to
drink
water
out
of
a
vessel
in
the
dark
especially
when
the
water
is
drawn
from
a
brook
or
river
for
the
evil
ones
in
the
water
hit
out
or
they
pass
with
the
water
into
a
man
therefore
in
drinking
you
should
hold
a
knife
with
three
blades
or
a
piece
of
iron
in
the
water
the
baleful
influence
of
the
nocturnal
demons
extends
also
to
useful
objects
hence
after
sunset
people
do
not
lend
salt
or
fire
and
do
not
shake
out
the
tablecloth
because
thereby
the
salt
would
lose
its
savour
and
the
welfare
of
the
house
would
chapter
iii
the
public
expulsion
of
evils
the
occasional
expulsion
of
evils
we
can
now
understand
why
those
general
clearances
of
evil
to
which
from
time
to
time
the
savage
resorts
should
commonly
take
the
form
of
a
forcible
expulsion
of
devils
in
these
evil
spirits
primitive
man
sees
the
cause
of
many
if
not
of
most
of
his
troubles
and
he
fancies
that
if
he
can
only
deliver
himself
from
them
things
will
go
better
with
him
the
public
attempts
to
expel
the
accumulated
ills
of
a
whole
community
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
according
as
the
expelled
evils
are
immaterial
and
invisible
or
are
embodied
in
a
material
vehicle
or
scapegoat
the
former
may
be
called
the
direct
or
immediate
expulsion
of
evils
the
latter
the
indirect
or
mediate
expulsion
or
the
expulsion
by
scapegoat
we
begin
with
examples
of
the
former
in
the
island
of
rook
between
new
guinea
and
new
britain
when
any
misfortune
has
happened
all
the
people
run
together
scream
curse
howl
and
beat
the
air
with
sticks
to
drive
away
the
devil
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
author
of
the
mishap
from
the
spot
where
the
mishap
took
place
they
drive
him
step
by
step
to
the
sea
and
on
reaching
the
shore
they
redouble
their
shouts
and
blows
in
order
to
expel
him
from
the
island
he
generally
retires
to
the
sea
or
to
the
island
of
lottin
the
natives
of
new
britain
ascribe
sickness
drought
the
failure
of
crops
and
in
short
all
misfortunes
to
the
influence
of
wicked
spirits
so
at
times
when
many
people
sicken
and
die
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
district
armed
with
branches
and
clubs
go
out
by
moonlight
to
the
fields
where
they
beat
and
stamp
on
the
ground
with
wild
howls
till
morning
believing
that
this
drives
away
the
devils
and
for
the
same
purpose
they
rush
through
the
village
with
burning
torches
the
natives
of
new
caledonia
are
said
to
believe
that
all
evils
are
caused
by
a
powerful
and
malignant
spirit
hence
in
order
to
rid
themselves
of
him
they
will
from
time
to
time
dig
a
great
pit
round
which
the
whole
tribe
gathers
after
cursing
the
demon
they
fill
up
the
pit
with
earth
and
trample
on
the
top
with
loud
shouts
this
they
call
burying
the
evil
spirit
among
the
dieri
tribe
of
central
australia
when
a
serious
illness
occurs
the
expel
cootchie
or
the
devil
by
beating
the
ground
in
and
outside
of
the
camp
with
the
stuffed
tail
of
a
kangaroo
until
they
have
chased
the
demon
away
to
some
distance
from
the
camp
in
some
south
african
tribes
it
is
a
general
rule
that
no
common
man
may
meddle
with
spirits
whether
good
or
bad
except
to
offer
the
customary
sacrifices
demons
may
haunt
him
and
make
his
life
a
burden
to
him
but
he
must
submit
to
their
machinations
until
the
matter
is
taken
up
by
the
proper
authorities
a
baboon
may
be
sent
by
evil
spirits
and
perch
on
a
tree
within
gunshot
or
regale
itself
in
his
but
to
fire
at
the
beast
would
be
worse
than
suicide
so
long
as
a
man
remains
a
solitary
sufferer
he
has
little
chance
of
redress
it
is
supposed
that
he
has
committed
some
crime
and
that
the
ancestors
in
their
wrath
have
sent
a
demon
to
torment
him
but
should
his
neighbours
also
suffer
should
the
baboon
from
choice
or
necessity
for
men
do
sometimes
pluck
up
courage
to
scare
the
brutes
select
a
fresh
field
for
its
depredations
or
the
roof
of
another
man
s
barn
for
its
perch
the
case
begins
to
wear
a
different
complexion
the
magicians
now
deal
with
the
matter
seriously
one
man
may
be
haunted
for
his
sins
by
a
demon
but
a
whole
community
infested
by
devils
is
another
matter
to
shoot
the
baboon
however
would
be
useless
it
would
merely
enrage
the
demon
and
increase
the
danger
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
ascertain
the
permanent
abode
of
the
devil
it
is
generally
a
deep
pool
with
overhanging
banks
and
dark
recesses
there
the
villagers
assemble
with
the
priests
and
magicians
at
their
head
and
set
about
pelting
the
demon
with
stones
men
women
and
children
all
joining
in
the
assault
while
they
load
the
object
of
their
fear
and
hate
with
the
foulest
abuse
drums
too
are
beaten
and
horns
blown
at
intervals
and
when
everybody
has
been
worked
up
to
such
a
frenzy
of
excitement
that
some
even
fancy
they
see
the
imp
dodging
the
missiles
he
suddenly
takes
to
flight
and
the
village
is
rid
of
him
for
a
time
after
that
the
crops
may
be
protected
and
baboons
killed
with
impunity
when
a
village
has
been
visited
by
a
series
of
disasters
or
a
severe
epidemic
the
inhabitants
of
minahassa
in
celebes
lay
the
blame
upon
the
devils
who
are
infesting
the
village
and
who
must
be
expelled
from
it
accordingly
early
one
morning
all
the
people
men
women
and
children
quit
their
homes
carrying
their
household
goods
with
them
and
take
up
their
quarters
in
temporary
huts
which
have
been
erected
outside
the
village
here
they
spend
several
days
offering
sacrifices
and
preparing
for
the
final
ceremony
at
last
the
men
some
wearing
masks
others
with
their
faces
blackened
and
so
on
but
all
armed
with
swords
guns
pikes
or
brooms
steal
cautiously
and
silently
back
to
the
deserted
village
then
at
a
signal
from
the
priest
they
rush
furiously
up
and
down
the
streets
and
into
and
under
the
houses
which
are
raised
on
piles
above
the
ground
yelling
and
striking
on
walls
doors
and
windows
to
drive
away
the
devils
next
the
priests
and
the
rest
of
the
people
come
with
the
holy
fire
and
march
nine
times
round
each
house
and
thrice
round
the
ladder
that
leads
up
to
it
carrying
the
fire
with
them
then
they
take
the
fire
into
the
kitchen
where
it
must
burn
for
three
days
continuously
the
devils
are
now
driven
away
and
great
and
general
is
the
joy
the
alfoors
of
halmahera
attribute
epidemics
to
the
devil
who
comes
from
other
villages
to
carry
them
off
so
in
order
to
rid
the
village
of
the
disease
the
sorcerer
drives
away
the
devil
from
all
the
villagers
he
receives
a
costly
garment
and
places
it
on
four
vessels
which
he
takes
to
the
forest
and
leaves
at
the
spot
where
the
devil
is
supposed
to
be
then
with
mocking
words
he
bids
the
demon
abandon
the
place
in
the
kei
islands
to
the
of
new
guinea
the
evil
spirits
who
are
quite
distinct
from
the
souls
of
the
dead
form
a
mighty
host
almost
every
tree
and
every
cave
is
the
of
one
of
these
fiends
who
are
moreover
extremely
irascible
and
apt
to
fly
out
on
the
smallest
provocation
to
speak
loudly
in
passing
their
abode
to
ease
nature
near
a
haunted
tree
or
cave
is
enough
to
bring
down
their
wrath
on
the
offender
and
he
must
either
appease
them
by
an
offering
or
burn
the
scrapings
of
a
buffalo
s
horn
or
the
hair
of
a
papuan
slave
in
order
that
the
smell
may
drive
the
foul
fiends
away
the
spirits
manifest
their
displeasure
by
sending
sickness
and
other
calamities
hence
in
times
of
public
misfortune
as
when
an
epidemic
is
raging
and
all
other
remedies
have
failed
the
whole
population
go
forth
with
the
priest
at
their
head
to
a
place
at
some
distance
from
the
village
here
at
sunset
they
erect
a
couple
of
poles
with
a
between
them
to
which
they
attach
bags
of
rice
wooden
models
of
gongs
bracelets
and
so
on
then
when
everybody
has
taken
his
place
at
the
poles
and
a
silence
reigns
the
priest
lifts
up
his
voice
and
addresses
the
spirits
in
their
own
language
as
follows
ho
ho
ho
ye
evil
spirits
who
dwell
in
the
trees
ye
evil
spirits
who
live
in
the
grottoes
ye
evil
spirits
who
lodge
in
the
earth
we
give
you
these
these
gongs
etc
let
the
sickness
cease
and
not
so
many
people
die
of
then
everybody
runs
home
as
fast
as
their
legs
can
carry
them
in
the
island
of
nias
when
a
man
is
seriously
ill
and
other
remedies
have
been
tried
in
vain
the
sorcerer
proceeds
to
exorcise
the
devil
who
is
causing
the
illness
a
pole
is
set
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
from
the
top
of
the
pole
a
rope
of
is
stretched
to
the
roof
of
the
house
then
the
sorcerer
mounts
the
roof
with
a
pig
which
he
kills
and
allows
to
roll
from
the
roof
to
the
ground
the
devil
anxious
to
get
the
pig
lets
himself
down
hastily
from
the
roof
by
the
rope
of
and
a
good
spirit
invoked
by
the
sorcerer
prevents
him
from
climbing
up
again
if
this
remedy
fails
it
is
believed
that
other
devils
must
still
be
lurking
in
the
house
so
a
general
hunt
is
made
after
them
all
the
doors
and
windows
in
the
house
are
closed
except
a
single
in
the
roof
the
men
shut
up
in
the
house
hew
and
slash
with
their
swords
right
and
left
to
the
clash
of
gongs
and
the
of
drums
terrified
at
this
onslaught
the
devils
escape
by
the
and
sliding
down
the
rope
of
take
themselves
off
as
all
the
doors
and
windows
except
the
one
in
the
roof
are
shut
the
devils
can
not
get
into
the
house
again
in
the
case
of
an
epidemic
the
proceedings
are
similar
all
the
gates
of
the
village
except
one
are
closed
every
voice
is
raised
every
gong
and
drum
beaten
every
sword
brandished
thus
the
devils
are
driven
out
and
the
last
gate
is
shut
behind
them
for
eight
days
thereafter
the
village
is
in
a
state
of
siege
no
one
being
allowed
to
enter
it
the
means
adopted
in
nias
to
exclude
an
epidemic
from
a
village
which
has
not
yet
been
infected
by
it
are
somewhat
similar
but
as
they
exhibit
an
interesting
combination
of
religious
ritual
with
the
purely
magical
ceremony
of
exorcism
it
may
be
worth
while
to
describe
them
when
it
is
known
that
a
village
is
suffering
from
the
ravages
of
a
dangerous
malady
the
other
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
take
what
they
regard
as
effective
measures
for
securing
immunity
from
the
disease
some
of
these
measures
commend
themselves
to
us
as
rational
and
others
do
not
in
the
first
place
quarantine
is
established
in
each
village
not
only
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
infected
village
but
against
all
strangers
no
person
from
outside
is
allowed
to
enter
in
the
second
place
a
feast
is
made
by
the
people
for
one
of
their
idols
who
goes
by
the
name
of
or
protector
from
sickness
all
the
people
of
the
village
must
participate
in
the
sacrifice
and
bear
a
share
of
the
cost
the
principal
idol
crowned
with
is
set
up
in
front
of
the
chief
s
house
and
all
the
inhabitants
who
can
do
so
gather
about
it
the
names
of
those
who
can
not
attend
are
mentioned
apparently
as
a
substitute
for
their
attendance
in
person
while
the
priest
is
reciting
the
spells
for
the
banishment
of
the
evil
spirits
all
persons
present
come
forward
and
touch
the
image
a
pig
is
then
killed
and
its
flesh
furnishes
a
common
meal
the
mouth
of
the
idol
is
smeared
with
the
bloody
heart
of
the
pig
and
a
dishful
of
the
cooked
pork
is
set
before
him
of
the
flesh
thus
consecrated
to
the
idol
none
but
priests
and
chiefs
may
partake
idols
called
or
branches
of
the
principal
idol
are
also
set
up
in
front
of
all
the
other
houses
in
the
village
moreover
bogies
made
of
black
wood
with
white
eyes
to
which
the
broken
crockery
of
the
inhabitants
has
freely
contributed
are
placed
at
the
entrances
of
the
village
to
scare
the
demon
and
prevent
him
from
entering
all
sorts
of
objects
whitened
with
chalk
are
also
hung
up
in
front
of
the
houses
to
keep
the
devil
out
when
eight
days
have
elapsed
it
is
thought
that
the
sacrifice
has
taken
effect
and
the
priest
puts
an
end
to
the
quarantine
all
boys
and
men
now
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
the
evil
spirit
led
by
the
priest
they
march
four
times
with
a
prodigious
noise
and
uproar
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
slashing
the
air
with
their
knives
and
stabbing
it
with
their
spears
to
frighten
the
devil
away
if
all
these
efforts
prove
vain
and
the
dreaded
sickness
breaks
out
the
people
think
it
must
be
because
they
have
departed
from
the
ways
of
their
fathers
by
raising
the
price
of
victuals
and
pigs
too
high
or
by
enriching
themselves
with
unjust
gain
accordingly
a
new
idol
is
made
and
set
up
in
front
of
the
chief
s
house
and
while
the
priest
engages
in
prayer
the
chief
and
the
magnates
of
the
village
touch
the
image
vowing
as
they
do
so
to
return
to
the
old
ways
and
cursing
all
such
as
may
refuse
their
consent
or
violate
the
new
law
thus
solemnly
enacted
then
all
present
betake
themselves
to
the
river
and
erect
another
idol
on
the
bank
in
presence
of
this
latter
idol
the
weights
and
measures
are
compared
and
any
that
exceed
the
lawful
standard
are
at
once
reduced
to
it
when
this
has
been
done
they
rock
the
image
to
and
fro
to
signify
or
perhaps
rather
to
ensure
thereby
that
he
who
does
not
keep
the
new
law
shall
suffer
misfortune
or
fall
sick
or
be
thwarted
in
some
way
or
other
then
a
pig
is
killed
and
eaten
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
feast
being
over
each
family
contributes
a
certain
sum
in
token
that
they
make
restitution
of
their
unlawful
gains
the
money
thus
collected
is
tied
in
a
bundle
and
the
priest
holds
the
bundle
up
towards
the
sky
and
down
towards
the
earth
to
satisfy
the
god
of
the
upper
and
the
god
of
the
nether
world
that
justice
has
now
been
done
after
that
he
either
flings
the
bag
of
money
into
the
river
or
buries
it
in
the
ground
beside
the
idol
in
the
latter
case
the
money
naturally
disappears
and
the
people
explain
its
disappearance
by
saying
that
the
evil
spirit
has
come
and
fetched
it
a
method
like
that
which
at
the
present
day
the
people
of
nias
adopt
for
the
sake
of
conjuring
the
demon
of
disease
was
employed
in
antiquity
by
the
caunians
of
asia
minor
to
banish
certain
foreign
gods
whom
they
had
imprudently
established
in
their
country
all
the
men
of
military
age
assembled
under
arms
and
with
in
the
air
drove
the
strange
gods
step
by
step
from
the
land
and
across
the
boundaries
the
solomon
islanders
of
bougainville
straits
believe
that
epidemics
are
always
or
nearly
always
caused
by
evil
spirits
and
accordingly
when
the
people
of
a
village
have
been
suffering
generally
from
colds
they
have
been
known
to
blow
beat
tins
shout
and
knock
on
the
houses
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
the
demons
and
so
curing
their
colds
when
cholera
has
broken
out
in
a
burmese
village
the
men
scramble
on
the
roofs
and
lay
about
them
with
bamboos
and
billets
of
wood
while
all
the
rest
of
the
population
old
and
young
stand
below
and
thump
drums
blow
trumpets
yell
scream
beat
floors
walls
tin
pans
everything
to
make
a
din
this
uproar
repeated
on
three
successive
nights
is
thought
to
be
very
effective
in
driving
away
the
cholera
demons
the
shans
of
kengtung
a
province
of
upper
burma
imagine
that
epidemics
are
brought
about
by
the
prowling
ghosts
of
wicked
men
such
as
thieves
and
murderers
who
can
not
rest
but
go
about
doing
all
the
harm
they
can
to
the
living
hence
when
sickness
is
rife
the
people
take
steps
to
expel
these
dangerous
spirits
the
buddhist
priests
exert
themselves
actively
in
the
beneficent
enterprise
they
assemble
in
a
body
at
the
town
court
and
read
the
scriptures
guns
are
fired
and
processions
march
to
the
city
gates
by
which
the
fiends
are
supposed
to
take
their
departure
there
small
trays
of
food
are
left
for
them
but
the
larger
offerings
are
deposited
in
the
middle
of
the
town
when
smallpox
first
appeared
amongst
the
kumis
of
india
they
thought
it
was
a
devil
come
from
aracan
the
villages
were
placed
in
a
state
of
siege
no
one
being
allowed
to
leave
or
enter
them
a
monkey
was
killed
by
being
dashed
on
the
ground
and
its
body
was
hung
at
the
village
gate
its
blood
mixed
with
small
river
pebbles
was
sprinkled
on
the
houses
the
threshold
of
every
house
was
swept
with
the
monkey
s
tail
and
the
fiend
was
adjured
to
depart
during
the
hot
summer
cholera
is
endemic
in
southern
china
and
from
time
to
time
when
the
mortality
is
great
vigorous
attempts
are
made
to
expel
the
demons
who
do
all
the
mischief
for
this
salutary
purpose
processions
parade
the
streets
by
night
images
of
the
gods
are
borne
in
them
torches
waved
gongs
beaten
guns
fired
crackers
popped
swords
brandished
trumpets
blown
and
priests
in
full
canonicals
trot
up
and
down
jingling
winding
blasts
on
buffalo
horns
and
reciting
exorcisms
sometimes
the
deities
are
represented
in
these
processions
by
living
men
who
are
believed
to
be
possessed
by
the
divine
spirit
such
a
may
be
seen
naked
to
the
waist
with
his
dishevelled
hair
streaming
down
his
back
long
daggers
are
stuck
in
his
cheeks
and
arms
so
that
the
blood
drips
from
them
in
his
hand
he
carries
a
sword
with
which
he
deals
doughty
blows
at
the
invisible
foes
in
the
air
but
sometimes
he
inflicts
bloody
wounds
on
his
own
back
with
the
weapon
or
with
a
ball
which
is
studded
with
long
sharp
nails
other
inspired
men
are
carried
in
armchairs
of
which
the
seat
back

and
are
set
with
nails
or
composed
of
rows
of
parallel
that
cut
into
the
flesh
of
the
wretches
seated
on
them
others
are
stretched
at
full
length
on
beds
of
nails
for
hours
these
bleeding
votaries
are
carried
about
the
city
again
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
in
the
procession
a
medium
or
with
a
thick
needle
thrust
through
his
tongue
his
bloody
spittle
drips
on
sheets
of
paper
which
the
crowd
eagerly
scrambles
for
knowing
that
with
the
blood
they
have
absorbed
the
power
inherent
in
the
the
bloody
papers
pasted
on
the
lintel
walls
or
beds
of
a
house
or
on
the
bodies
of
the
family
are
supposed
to
afford
complete
protection
against
cholera
such
are
the
methods
by
which
in
southern
china
the
demons
of
disease
are
banished
the
city
in
japan
the
method
of
staying
an
epidemic
is
to
expel
the
demon
of
the
plague
from
every
house
into
which
he
has
entered
the
treatment
begins
with
the
house
in
which
the
malady
has
appeared
in
the
mildest
form
first
of
all
a
shinto
priest
makes
a
preliminary
visit
to
the
and
extracts
from
the
demon
a
promise
that
he
will
depart
with
him
at
his
next
visit
the
day
after
he
comes
again
and
seating
himself
near
the
patient
beseeches
the
evil
spirit
to
come
away
with
him
meanwhile
red

is
used
only
on
special
occasions
has
been
placed
at
the
sufferer
s
head
a
closed
litter
made
of
pine
boughs
has
been
brought
in
and
four
men
equipped
with
flags
or
weapons
have
taken
post
in
the
four
corners
of
the
room
to
prevent
the
demon
from
seeking
refuge
there
all
are
silent
but
the
priest
the
prayer
being
over
the
sick
man
s
pillow
is
hastily
thrown
into
the
litter
and
the
priest
cries
all
right
now
at
that
the
bearers
double
with
it
into
the
street
the
people
within
and
without
beat
the
air
with
swords
sticks
or
anything
that
comes
to
hand
while
others
assist
in
the
cure
by
banging
away
at
drums
and
gongs
a
procession
is
now
formed
in
which
only
men
take
part
some
of
them
carrying
banners
others
provided
with
a
drum
a
bell
a
flute
a
horn
and
all
of
them
wearing
fillets
and
horns
of
twisted
straw
to
keep
the
demon
away
from
themselves
as
the
procession
starts
an
old
man
chants
what
god
are
you
bearing
away
to
which
the
others
respond
in
chorus
the
god
of
the
pest
we
are
bearing
away
then
to
the
music
of
the
drum
the
bell
the
flute
and
the
horn
the
litter
is
borne
through
the
streets
during
its
passage
all
the
people
in
the
town
who
are
not
taking
part
in
the
ceremony
remain
indoors
every
house
along
the
route
of
the
procession
is
carefully
closed
and
at
the
swordsmen
are
stationed
who
guard
the
street
by
hewing
the
air
to
right
and
left
with
their
blades
lest
the
demon
should
escape
by
that
way
the
litter
is
thus
carried
to
a
retired
spot
between
two
towns
and
left
there
while
all
who
escorted
it
thither
run
away
only
the
priest
remains
behind
for
half
an
hour
to
complete
the
exorcism
and
the
cure
the
bearers
of
the
litter
spend
the
night
praying
in
a
temple
next
day
they
return
home
but
not
until
they
have
plunged
into
a
cold
bath
in
the
open
air
to
prevent
the
demon
from
following
them
the
same
litter
serves
to
convey
the
evil
spirit
from
every
house
in
the
town
in
corea
when
a
patient
is
recovering
from
the
smallpox
a
farewell
dinner
is
given
in
honour
of
the
departing
spirit
of
the
disease
friends
and
relations
are
invited
and
the
spirit
s
share
of
the
good
things
is
packed
on
the
back
of
a
and
despatched
to
the
boundary
of
the
town
or
village
while
respectful
farewells
are
spoken
and
hearty
good
wishes
uttered
for
his
prosperous
journey
to
his
own
place
in
tonquin
also
a
banquet
is
sometimes
given
to
the
demon
of
sickness
to
induce
him
to
go
quietly
away
from
the
house
the
most
honourable
place
at
the
festive
board
is
reserved
for
the
fiend
prayers
caresses
and
presents
are
lavished
on
him
but
if
he
proves
obdurate
they
assail
him
with
coarse
abuse
and
drive
him
from
the
house
with
when
an
epidemic
is
raging
on
the
gold
coast
of
west
africa
the
people
will
sometimes
turn
out
armed
with
clubs
and
torches
to
drive
the
evil
spirits
away
at
a
given
signal
the
whole
population
begin
with
frightful
yells
to
beat
in
every
corner
of
the
houses
then
rush
like
mad
into
the
streets
waving
torches
and
striking
frantically
in
the
empty
air
the
uproar
goes
on
till
somebody
reports
that
the
cowed
and
daunted
demons
have
made
good
their
escape
by
a
gate
of
the
town
or
village
the
people
stream
out
after
them
pursue
them
for
some
distance
into
the
forest
and
warn
them
never
to
return
the
expulsion
of
the
devils
is
followed
by
a
general
massacre
of
all
the
cocks
in
the
village
or
town
lest
by
their
unseasonable
crowing
they
should
betray
to
the
banished
demons
the
direction
they
must
take
to
return
to
their
old
homes
for
in
that
country
the
forest
grows
so
thick
or
the
grass
so
high
that
you
can
seldom
see
a
village
till
you
are
close
upon
it
and
the
first
warning
of
your
approach
to
human
habitations
is
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
at
great
bassam
in
guinea
the
french
traveller
hecquard
witnessed
the
exorcism
of
the
evil
spirit
who
was
believed
to
make
women
barren
the
women
who
wished
to
become
mothers
offered
to
the
fetish
or
statuettes
representing
women
suckling
children
then
being
assembled
in
the
fetish
hut
they
were
sprinkled
with
rum
by
the
priest
while
young
men
fired
guns
and
brandished
swords
to
drive
away
the
demon
when
smallpox
breaks
out
in
a
village
of
the
cameroons
in
west
africa
the
spirit
of
the
disease
is
driven
out
of
the
village
by
a
bushman
or
member
of
the
oppressed
bassa
tribe
the
members
of
which
are
reputed
to
possess
high
magical
powers
the
mode
of
expulsion
consists
in
drumming
and
dancing
for
several
days
then
the
village
is
enclosed
by
ropes
made
of
creepers
in
order
that
the
disease
may
not
return
over
the
principal
paths
arches
of
bent
poles
are
made
and
fowls
are
buried
as
sacrifices
plants
of
various
sorts
and
the
nests
of
termite
ants
are
hung
from
the
arches
and
a
dog
freshly
killed
is
suspended
over
the
middle
of
the
entrance
the
gallas
try
to
drive
away
fever
by
firing
guns
shouting
and
lighting
great
fires
when
sickness
was
prevalent
in
a
huron
village
and
all
other
remedies
had
been
tried
in
vain
the
indians
had
recourse
to
the
ceremony
called
which
is
the
principal
invention
and
most
proper
means
so
they
say
to
expel
from
the
town
or
village
the
devils
and
evil
spirits
which
cause
induce
and
import
all
the
maladies
and
infirmities
which
they
suffer
in
body
and
accordingly
one
evening
the
men
would
begin
to
rush
like
madmen
about
the
village
breaking
and
upsetting
whatever
they
came
across
in
the
wigwams
they
threw
fire
and
burning
brands
about
the
streets
and
all
night
long
they
ran
howling
and
singing
without
cessation
then
they
all
dreamed
of
something
a
knife
dog
skin
or
whatever
it
might
be
and
when
morning
came
they
went
from
wigwam
to
wigwam
asking
for
presents
these
they
received
silently
till
the
particular
thing
was
given
them
which
they
had
dreamed
about
on
receiving
it
they
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
rushed
from
the
hut
amid
the
congratulations
of
all
present
the
health
of
those
who
received
what
they
had
dreamed
of
was
believed
to
be
assured
whereas
those
who
did
not
get
what
they
had
set
their
hearts
upon
regarded
their
fate
as
sealed
sometimes
instead
of
chasing
the
demon
of
disease
from
their
homes
savages
prefer
to
leave
him
in
peaceable
possession
while
they
themselves
take
to
flight
and
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
following
in
their
tracks
thus
when
the
patagonians
were
attacked
by
smallpox
which
they
attributed
to
the
machinations
of
an
evil
spirit
they
used
to
abandon
their
sick
and
flee
slashing
the
air
with
their
weapons
and
throwing
water
about
in
order
to
keep
off
the
dreadful
pursuer
and
when
after
several
days
march
they
reached
a
place
where
they
hoped
to
be
beyond
his
reach
they
used
by
way
of
precaution
to
plant
all
their
cutting
weapons
with
the
sharp
edges
turned
towards
the
quarter
from
which
they
had
come
as
if
they
were
repelling
a
charge
of
cavalry
similarly
when
the
lules
or
tonocotes
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
were
attacked
by
an
epidemic
they
regularly
sought
to
evade
it
by
flight
but
in
so
doing
they
always
followed
a
sinuous
not
a
straight
course
because
they
said
that
when
the
disease
made
after
them
he
would
be
so
exhausted
by
the
turnings
and
windings
of
the
route
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
come
up
with
them
when
the
indians
of
new
mexico
were
decimated
by
smallpox
or
other
infectious
disease
they
used
to
shift
their
quarters
every
day
retreating
into
the
most
sequestered
parts
of
the
mountains
and
choosing
the
thorniest
thickets
they
could
find
in
the
hope
that
the
smallpox
would
be
too
afraid
of
scratching
himself
on
the
thorns
to
follow
them
when
some
chins
on
a
visit
to
rangoon
were
attacked
by
cholera
they
went
about
with
drawn
swords
to
scare
away
the
demon
and
they
spent
the
day
hiding
under
bushes
so
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
them
the
periodic
expulsion
of
evils
the
expulsion
of
evils
from
being
occasional
tends
to
become
periodic
it
comes
to
be
thought
desirable
to
have
a
general
riddance
of
evil
spirits
at
fixed
times
usually
once
a
year
in
order
that
the
people
may
make
a
fresh
start
in
life
freed
from
all
the
malignant
influences
which
have
been
long
accumulating
about
them
some
of
the
australian
blacks
annually
expelled
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
from
their
territory
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
by
the
rev
ridley
on
the
banks
of
the
river
barwan
a
chorus
of
twenty
old
and
young
were
singing
and
beating
time
with
boomerangs
suddenly
from
under
a
sheet
of
bark
darted
a
man
with
his
body
whitened
by
pipeclay
his
head
and
face
coloured
with
lines
of
red
and
yellow
and
a
tuft
of
feathers
fixed
by
means
of
a
stick
two
feet
above
the
crown
of
his
head
he
stood
twenty
minutes
perfectly
still
gazing
upwards
an
aboriginal
who
stood
by
told
me
he
was
looking
for
the
ghosts
of
dead
men
at
last
he
began
to
move
very
slowly
and
soon
rushed
to
and
fro
at
full
speed
flourishing
a
branch
as
if
to
drive
away
some
foes
invisible
to
us
when
i
thought
this
pantomime
must
be
almost
over
ten
more
similarly
adorned
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
the
trees
and
the
whole
party
joined
in
a
brisk
conflict
with
their
mysterious
assailants
at
last
after
some
rapid
evolutions
in
which
they
put
forth
all
their
strength
they
rested
from
the
exciting
toil
which
they
had
kept
up
all
night
and
for
some
hours
after
sunrise
they
seemed
satisfied
that
the
ghosts
were
driven
away
for
twelve
months
they
were
performing
the
same
ceremony
at
every
station
along
the
river
and
i
am
told
it
is
an
annual
certain
seasons
of
the
year
mark
themselves
naturally
out
as
appropriate
moments
for
a
general
expulsion
of
devils
such
a
moment
occurs
towards
the
close
of
an
arctic
winter
when
the
sun
reappears
on
the
horizon
after
an
absence
of
weeks
or
months
accordingly
at
point
barrow
the
most
northerly
extremity
of
alaska
and
nearly
of
america
the
esquimaux
choose
the
moment
of
the
sun
s
reappearance
to
hunt
the
mischievous
spirit
tuña
from
every
house
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
by
the
members
of
the
united
states
polar
expedition
who
wintered
at
point
barrow
a
fire
was
built
in
front
of
the
and
an
old
woman
was
posted
at
the
entrance
to
every
house
the
men
gathered
round
the
while
the
young
women
and
girls
drove
the
spirits
out
of
every
house
with
their
knives
stabbing
viciously
under
the
bunk
and
and
calling
upon
tuña
to
be
gone
when
they
thought
he
had
been
driven
out
of
every
hole
and
corner
they
thrust
him
down
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
and
chased
him
into
the
open
air
with
loud
cries
and
frantic
gestures
meanwhile
the
old
woman
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
made
passes
with
a
long
knife
in
the
air
to
keep
him
from
returning
each
party
drove
the
spirit
towards
the
fire
and
invited
him
to
go
into
it
all
were
by
this
time
drawn
up
in
a
semicircle
round
the
fire
when
several
of
the
leading
men
made
specific
charges
against
the
spirit
and
each
after
his
speech
brushed
his
clothes
violently
calling
on
the
spirit
to
leave
him
and
go
into
the
fire
two
men
now
stepped
forward
with
rifles
loaded
with
blank
cartridges
while
a
third
brought
a
vessel
of
urine
and
flung
it
on
the
flames
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
men
fired
a
shot
into
the
fire
and
as
the
cloud
of
steam
rose
it
received
the
other
shot
which
was
supposed
to
finish
tuña
for
the
time
being
in
late
autumn
when
storms
rage
over
the
land
and
break
the
icy
fetters
by
which
the
frozen
sea
is
as
yet
but
slightly
bound
when
the
loosened
floes
are
driven
against
each
other
and
break
with
loud
crashes
and
when
the
cakes
of
ice
are
piled
in
wild
disorder
one
upon
another
the
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
fancy
they
hear
the
voices
of
the
spirits
who
people
the
air
then
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
knock
wildly
at
the
huts
which
they
can
not
enter
and
woe
to
the
hapless
wight
whom
they
catch
he
soon
sickens
and
dies
then
the
phantom
of
a
huge
hairless
dog
pursues
the
real
dogs
which
expire
in
convulsions
and
cramps
at
sight
of
him
all
the
countless
spirits
of
evil
are
abroad
striving
to
bring
sickness
and
death
foul
weather
and
failure
in
hunting
on
the
esquimaux
most
dreaded
of
all
these
spectral
visitants
are
sedna
mistress
of
the
nether
world
and
her
father
to
whose
share
dead
esquimaux
fall
while
the
other
spirits
fill
the
air
and
the
water
she
rises
from
under
ground
it
is
then
a
busy
season
for
the
wizards
in
every
house
you
may
hear
them
singing
and
praying
while
they
conjure
the
spirits
seated
in
a
mystic
gloom
at
the
back
of
the
hut
which
is
dimly
lit
by
a
lamp
burning
low
the
hardest
task
of
all
is
to
drive
away
sedna
and
this
is
reserved
for
the
most
powerful
enchanter
a
rope
is
coiled
on
the
floor
of
a
large
hut
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
a
small
opening
at
the
top
which
represents
the
breathing
hole
of
a
seal
two
enchanters
stand
beside
it
one
of
them
grasping
a
spear
as
if
he
were
watching
a
in
winter
the
other
holding
the
a
third
sorcerer
sits
at
the
back
of
the
hut
chanting
a
magic
song
to
lure
sedna
to
the
spot
now
she
is
heard
approaching
under
the
floor
of
the
hut
breathing
heavily
now
she
emerges
at
the
hole
now
she
is
harpooned
and
sinks
away
in
angry
haste
dragging
the
harpoon
with
her
while
the
two
men
hold
on
to
the
line
with
all
their
might
the
struggle
is
severe
but
at
last
by
a
desperate
wrench
she
tears
herself
away
and
returns
to
her
dwelling
in
adlivun
when
the
harpoon
is
drawn
up
out
of
the
hole
it
is
found
to
be
splashed
with
blood
which
the
enchanters
proudly
exhibit
as
a
proof
of
their
prowess
thus
sedna
and
the
other
evil
spirits
are
at
last
driven
away
and
next
day
a
great
festival
is
celebrated
by
old
and
young
in
honour
of
the
event
but
they
must
still
be
cautious
for
the
wounded
sedna
is
furious
and
will
seize
any
one
she
may
find
outside
of
his
hut
so
they
all
wear
amulets
on
the
top
of
their
hoods
to
protect
themselves
against
her
these
amulets
consist
of
pieces
of
the
first
garments
that
they
wore
after
birth
the
koryaks
of
the
taigonos
peninsula
in
asia
celebrate
annually
a
festival
after
the
winter
solstice
rich
men
invite
all
their
neighbours
to
the
festival
offer
a
sacrifice
to
and
slaughter
many
reindeer
for
their
guests
if
there
is
a
shaman
present
he
goes
all
round
the
interior
of
the
house
beating
the
drum
and
driving
away
the
demons
he
searches
all
the
people
in
the
house
and
if
he
finds
a
demon
s
arrow
sticking
in
the
body
of
one
of
them
he
pulls
it
out
though
naturally
the
arrow
is
invisible
to
common
eyes
in
this
way
he
protects
them
against
disease
and
death
if
there
is
no
shaman
present
the
demons
may
be
expelled
by
the
host
or
by
a
woman
skilled
in
incantations
the
iroquois
inaugurated
the
new
year
in
january
february
or
march
the
time
varied
with
a
festival
of
dreams
like
that
which
the
hurons
observed
on
special
occasions
the
whole
ceremonies
lasted
several
days
or
even
weeks
and
formed
a
kind
of
saturnalia
men
and
women
variously
disguised
went
from
wigwam
to
wigwam
smashing
and
throwing
down
whatever
they
came
across
it
was
a
time
of
general
license
the
people
were
supposed
to
be
out
of
their
senses
and
therefore
not
to
be
responsible
for
what
they
did
accordingly
many
seized
the
opportunity
of
paying
off
old
scores
by
belabouring
obnoxious
persons
drenching
them
with
water
and
covering
them
with
filth
or
hot
ashes
others
seized
burning
brands
or
coals
and
flung
them
at
the
heads
of
the
first
persons
they
met
the
only
way
of
escaping
from
these
persecutors
was
to
guess
what
they
had
dreamed
of
on
one
day
of
the
festival
the
ceremony
of
driving
away
evil
spirits
from
the
village
took
place
men
clothed
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
their
faces
covered
with
hideous
masks
and
their
hands
with
the
shell
of
the
tortoise
went
from
hut
to
hut
making
frightful
noises
in
every
hut
they
took
the
fuel
from
the
fire
and
scattered
the
embers
and
ashes
about
the
floor
with
their
hands
the
general
confession
of
sins
which
preceded
the
festival
was
probably
a
preparation
for
the
public
expulsion
of
evil
influences
it
was
a
way
of
stripping
the
people
of
their
moral
burdens
that
these
might
be
collected
and
cast
out
this
new
year
festival
is
still
celebrated
by
some
of
the
heathen
iroquois
though
it
has
been
shorn
of
its
former
turbulence
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
ceremony
is
now
the
sacrifice
of
the
white
dog
but
this
appears
to
have
been
added
to
the
festival
in
comparatively
modern
times
and
does
not
figure
in
the
oldest
descriptions
of
the
ceremonies
we
shall
return
to
it
later
on
a
great
annual
festival
of
the
cherokee
indians
was
the
propitiation
cementation
or
purification
festival
it
was
celebrated
shortly
after
the
first
new
moon
of
autumn
and
consisted
of
a
multiplicity
of
rigorous
rites
fastings
ablutions
and
purifications
among
the
most
important
functionaries
on
the
occasion
were
seven
exorcisers
or
cleansers
whose
duty
it
was
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
proceedings
to
drive
away
evil
and
purify
the
town
each
one
bore
in
his
hand
a
white
rod
of
sycamore
the
leader
followed
by
the
others
walked
around
the
national
heptagon
and
coming
to
the
treasure
or
to
the
west
of
it
they
lashed
the
eaves
of
the
roofs
with
their
rods
the
leader
then
went
to
another
house
followed
by
the
others
singing
and
repeated
the
same
ceremony
until
every
house
was
this
ceremony
was
repeated
daily
during
the
continuance
of
the
festival
in
performing
their
ablutions
they
went
into
the
water
and
allowed
their
old
clothes
to
be
carried
away
by
the
stream
by
which
means
they
supposed
their
impurities
in
september
the
incas
of
peru
celebrated
a
festival
called
situa
the
object
of
which
was
to
banish
from
the
capital
and
its
vicinity
all
disease
and
trouble
the
festival
fell
in
september
because
the
rains
begin
about
this
time
and
with
the
first
rains
there
was
generally
much
sickness
and
the
melancholy
begotten
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
the
sickliness
of
the
season
may
well
have
been
heightened
by
the
sternness
of
a
landscape
which
at
all
times
is
fitted
to
oppress
the
mind
with
a
sense
of
desolation
and
gloom
for
cuzco
the
capital
of
the
incas
and
the
scene
of
the
ceremony
lies
in
a
high
upland
valley
bare
and
treeless
shut
in
on
every
side
by
the
most
arid
and
forbidding
mountains
as
a
preparation
for
the
festival
the
people
fasted
on
the
first
day
of
the
moon
after
the
autumnal
equinox
having
fasted
during
the
day
and
the
night
being
come
they
baked
a
coarse
paste
of
maize
this
paste
was
made
of
two
sorts
one
was
kneaded
with
the
blood
of
children
aged
from
five
to
ten
years
the
blood
being
obtained
by
bleeding
the
children
between
the
eyebrows
these
two
kinds
of
paste
were
baked
separately
because
they
were
for
different
uses
each
family
assembled
at
the
house
of
the
eldest
brother
to
celebrate
the
feast
and
those
who
had
no
elder
brother
went
to
the
house
of
their
next
relation
of
greater
age
on
the
same
night
all
who
had
fasted
during
the
day
washed
their
bodies
and
taking
a
little
of
the
paste
rubbed
it
over
their
head
face
breast
shoulders
arms
and
legs
they
did
this
in
order
that
the
paste
might
take
away
all
their
infirmities
after
this
the
head
of
the
family
anointed
the
threshold
with
the
same
paste
and
left
it
there
as
a
token
that
the
inmates
of
the
house
had
performed
their
ablutions
and
cleansed
their
bodies
meantime
the
high
priest
performed
the
same
ceremonies
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
all
the
people
worshipped
and
besought
him
to
drive
all
evils
out
of
the
city
and
then
they
broke
their
fast
with
the
paste
that
had
been
kneaded
without
blood
when
they
had
paid
their
worship
and
broken
their
fast
which
they
did
at
a
stated
hour
in
order
that
all
might
adore
the
sun
as
one
man
an
inca
of
the
blood
royal
came
forth
from
the
fortress
as
a
messenger
of
the
sun
richly
dressed
with
his
mantle
girded
round
his
body
and
a
lance
in
his
hand
the
lance
was
decked
with
feathers
of
many
hues
extending
from
the
blade
to
the
socket
and
fastened
with
rings
of
gold
he
ran
down
the
hill
from
the
fortress
brandishing
his
lance
till
he
reached
the
centre
of
the
great
square
where
stood
the
golden
urn
like
a
fountain
that
was
used
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
fermented
juice
of
the
maize
here
four
other
incas
of
the
blood
royal
awaited
him
each
with
a
lance
in
his
hand
and
his
mantle
girded
up
to
run
the
messenger
touched
their
four
lances
with
his
lance
and
told
them
that
the
sun
bade
them
as
his
messengers
drive
the
evils
out
of
the
city
the
four
incas
then
separated
and
ran
down
the
four
royal
roads
which
led
out
of
the
city
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
while
they
ran
all
the
people
great
and
small
came
to
the
doors
of
their
houses
and
with
great
shouts
of
joy
and
gladness
shook
their
clothes
as
if
they
were
shaking
off
dust
while
they
cried
let
the
evils
be
gone
how
greatly
desired
has
this
festival
been
by
us
o
creator
of
all
things
permit
us
to
reach
another
year
that
we
may
see
another
feast
like
after
they
had
shaken
their
clothes
they
passed
their
hands
over
their
heads
faces
arms
and
legs
as
if
in
the
act
of
washing
all
this
was
done
to
drive
the
evils
out
of
their
houses
that
the
messengers
of
the
sun
might
banish
them
from
the
city
and
it
was
done
not
only
in
the
streets
through
which
the
incas
ran
but
generally
in
all
quarters
of
the
city
moreover
they
all
danced
the
inca
himself
amongst
them
and
bathed
in
the
rivers
and
fountains
saying
that
their
maladies
would
come
out
of
them
then
they
took
great
torches
of
straw
bound
round
with
cords
these
they
lighted
and
passed
from
one
to
the
other
striking
each
other
with
them
and
saying
let
all
harm
go
meanwhile
the
runners
ran
with
their
lances
for
a
quarter
of
a
league
outside
the
city
where
they
found
four
other
incas
ready
who
received
the
lances
from
their
hands
and
ran
with
them
thus
the
lances
were
carried
by
relays
of
runners
for
a
distance
of
five
or
six
leagues
at
the
end
of
which
the
runners
washed
themselves
and
their
weapons
in
rivers
and
set
up
the
lances
in
sign
of
a
boundary
within
which
the
banished
evils
might
not
return
the
negroes
of
guinea
annually
banish
the
devil
from
all
their
towns
with
much
ceremony
at
a
time
set
apart
for
the
purpose
at
axim
on
the
gold
coast
this
annual
expulsion
is
preceded
by
a
feast
of
eight
days
during
which
mirth
and
jollity
skipping
dancing
and
singing
prevail
and
a
perfect
lampooning
liberty
is
allowed
and
scandal
so
highly
exalted
that
they
may
freely
sing
of
all
the
faults
villanies
and
frauds
of
their
superiors
as
well
as
inferiors
without
punishment
or
so
much
as
the
least
on
the
eighth
day
they
hunt
out
the
devil
with
a
dismal
cry
running
after
him
and
pelting
him
with
sticks
stones
and
whatever
comes
to
hand
when
they
have
driven
him
far
enough
out
of
the
town
they
all
return
in
this
way
he
is
expelled
from
more
than
a
hundred
towns
at
the
same
time
to
make
sure
that
he
does
not
return
to
their
houses
the
women
wash
and
scour
all
their
wooden
and
earthen
vessels
to
free
them
from
all
uncleanness
and
the
a
later
writer
tells
us
that
on
the
gold
coast
there
are
stated
occasions
when
the
people
turn
out
generally
at
night
with
clubs
and
torches
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirits
from
their
towns
at
a
given
signal
the
whole
community
start
up
commence
a
most
hideous
howling
beat
about
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
their
dwellings
then
rush
into
the
streets
with
their
torches
and
clubs
like
so
many
frantic
maniacs
beat
the
air
and
scream
at
the
top
of
their
voices
until
some
one
announces
the
departure
of
the
spirits
through
some
gate
of
the
town
when
they
are
pursued
several
miles
into
the
woods
and
warned
not
to
come
back
after
this
the
people
breathe
easier
sleep
more
quietly
have
better
health
and
the
town
is
once
more
cheered
by
an
abundance
of
the
ceremony
as
it
is
practised
at
gatto
in
benin
has
been
described
by
an
english
traveller
he
says
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
witnessed
a
strange
ceremony
peculiar
to
this
people
called
the
time
of
the
grand
eight
men
were
dressed
in
a
most
curious
manner
having
a
dress
made
of
bamboo
about
their
bodies
and
a
cap
on
the
head
of
various
colours
and
ornamented
with
red
feathers
taken
from
the
parrot
s
tail
round
the
legs
were
twisted
strings
of
shells
which
made
a
clattering
noise
as
they
walked
and
the
face
and
hands
of
each
individual
were
covered
with
a
net
these
strange
beings
go
about
the
town
by
day
and
by
night
for
the
term
of
one
month
uttering
the
most
discordant
and
frightful
noises
no
one
durst
venture
out
at
night
for
fear
of
being
killed
or
seriously
maltreated
by
these
fellows
who
are
then
especially
engaged
in
driving
the
evil
spirits
from
the
town
they
go
round
to
all
the
chief
s
houses
and
in
addition
to
the
noise
they
make
perform
some
extraordinary
feats
in
tumbling
and
gymnastics
for
which
they
receive
a
few
at
cape
coast
castle
on
the
gold
coast
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
on
the
ninth
of
october
by
an
englishman
who
has
described
it
as
follows
the
annual
custom
of
driving
the
evil
spirit
abonsam
out
of
the
town
has
taken
place
as
soon
as
the
eight
o
clock
gun
fired
in
the
fort
the
people
began
firing
muskets
in
their
houses
turning
all
their
furniture
out
of
doors
beating
about
in
every
corner
of
the
rooms
with
sticks
and
screaming
as
loudly
as
possible
in
order
to
frighten
the
devil
being
driven
out
of
the
houses
as
they
imagine
they
sallied
forth
into
the
streets
throwing
lighted
torches
about
shouting
screaming
beating
sticks
together
rattling
old
pans
making
the
most
horrid
noise
in
order
to
drive
him
out
of
the
town
into
the
sea
the
custom
is
preceded
by
four
weeks
dead
silence
no
gun
is
allowed
to
be
fired
no
drum
to
be
beaten
no
palaver
to
be
made
between
man
and
man
if
during
these
weeks
two
natives
should
disagree
and
make
a
noise
in
the
town
they
are
immediately
taken
before
the
king
and
fined
heavily
if
a
dog
or
pig
sheep
or
goat
be
found
at
large
in
the
street
it
may
be
killed
or
taken
by
anyone
the
former
owner
not
being
allowed
to
demand
any
compensation
this
silence
is
designed
to
deceive
abonsam
that
being
off
his
guard
he
may
be
taken
by
surprise
and
frightened
out
of
the
place
if
anyone
die
during
the
silence
his
relatives
are
not
allowed
to
weep
until
the
four
weeks
have
been
at
onitsha
on
the
niger
taylor
witnessed
the
celebration
of
new
year
s
day
by
the
negroes
it
fell
on
the
twentieth
of
december
every
family
brought
a
firebrand
out
into
the
street
threw
it
away
and
exclaimed
as
they
returned
the
gods
of
the
new
year
new
year
has
come
round
taylor
adds
the
meaning
of
the
custom
seems
to
be
that
the
fire
is
to
drive
away
the
old
year
with
its
sorrows
and
evils
and
to
embrace
the
new
year
with
hearty
of
all
abyssinian
festivals
that
of
mascal
or
the
cross
is
celebrated
with
the
greatest
pomp
during
the
whole
of
the
interval
between
john
s
day
and
the
feast
a
desultory
warfare
is
waged
betwixt
the
youth
of
opposite
sexes
in
the
towns
they
all
sally
out
in
the
evenings
the
boys
armed
with
nettles
or
thistles
and
the
girls
with
gourds
containing
a
filthy
solution
of
all
sorts
of
abominations
when
any
of
the
hostile
parties
meet
they
begin
by
reviling
each
other
in
the
foulest
language
from
which
they
proceed
to
personal
violence
the
boys
stinging
the
girls
with
their
nettles
while
the
girls
discharge
their
in
the
faces
of
their
adversaries
these
hostilities
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
a
preparation
for
the
festival
of
the
cross
the
eve
of
the
festival
witnesses
a
ceremony
which
doubtless
belongs
to
the
class
of
customs
we
are
dealing
with
at
sunset
a
discharge
of
firearms
takes
place
from
all
the
principal
houses
then
every
one
provides
himself
with
a
torch
and
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
bonfires
are
kindled
and
the
people
parade
the
town
carrying
their
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
they
go
through
their
houses
too
poking
a
light
into
every
dark
corner
in
the
hall
under
the
couches
in
the
stables
kitchen
as
if
looking
for
something
lost
and
calling
out
akho
akhoky
turn
out
the
spinage
and
bring
in
the
porridge
mascal
is
come
after
this
they
play
and
poke
fun
and
torches
at
each
next
morning
while
it
is
still
dark
bonfires
are
kindled
on
the
heights
near
the
towns
and
people
rise
early
to
see
them
the
rising
sun
of
mascal
finds
the
whole
population
of
abyssinia
awake
sometimes
the
date
of
the
annual
expulsion
of
devils
is
fixed
with
reference
to
the
agricultural
seasons
thus
at
kiriwina
in
new
guinea
when
the
new
yams
had
been
harvested
the
people
feasted
and
danced
for
many
days
and
a
great
deal
of
property
such
as
armlets
native
money
and
so
forth
was
displayed
conspicuously
on
a
platform
erected
for
the
purpose
when
the
festivities
were
over
all
the
people
gathered
together
and
expelled
the
spirits
from
the
village
by
shouting
beating
the
posts
of
the
houses
and
overturning
everything
under
which
a
wily
spirit
might
be
supposed
to
lurk
the
explanation
which
the
people
gave
to
a
missionary
was
that
they
had
entertained
and
feasted
the
spirits
and
provided
them
with
riches
and
it
was
now
time
for
them
to
take
their
departure
had
they
not
seen
the
dances
and
heard
the
songs
and
gorged
themselves
on
the
souls
of
the
yams
and
appropriated
the
souls
of
the
money
and
all
the
other
fine
things
set
out
on
the
platform
what
more
could
the
spirits
want
so
out
they
must
go
among
the
hos
of
togoland
in
west
africa
the
expulsion
of
evils
is
performed
annually
before
the
people
eat
the
new
yams
the
chiefs
meet
together
and
summon
the
priests
and
magicians
they
tell
them
that
the
people
are
now
to
eat
the
new
yams
and
to
be
merry
therefore
they
must
cleanse
the
town
and
remove
the
evils
for
that
purpose
they
take
leaves
of
the
and
trees
together
with
creepers
and
ashes
the
leaves
and
creepers
they
bind
fast
to
a
pole
of
an
tree
while
they
pray
that
the
evil
spirits
the
witches
and
all
the
ills
in
the
town
may
pass
into
the
bundle
and
be
bound
then
they
make
a
paste
out
of
the
ashes
and
smear
it
on
the
bundle
saying
we
smear
it
on
the
face
of
all
the
evil
ones
who
are
in
this
bundle
in
order
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
with
that
they
throw
the
bundle
that
is
the
pole
wrapt
in
leaves
and
creepers
on
the
ground
and
they
all
mock
at
it
then
they
prepare
a
medicine
and
take
the
various
poles
into
which
they
have
conjured
and
bound
up
all
mischief
carry
them
out
of
the
town
and
set
them
up
in
the
earth
on
various
roads
leading
into
the
town
when
they
have
done
this
they
say
that
they
have
banished
the
evils
from
the
town
and
shut
the
door
in
their
face
with
the
medicine
which
the
elders
have
prepared
all
men
women
children
and
chiefs
wash
their
faces
after
that
everybody
goes
home
to
sweep
out
his
house
and
homestead
the
ground
in
front
of
the
homesteads
is
also
swept
so
that
the
town
is
thoroughly
cleansed
all
the
stalks
of
grass
and
refuse
of
stock
yams
that
have
been
swept
together
they
cast
out
of
the
town
and
they
rail
at
the
stock
yams
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
elders
assemble
and
bind
a
toad
to
a
young
they
say
that
they
will
now
sweep
out
the
town
and
end
the
ceremony
for
that
purpose
they
drag
the
toad
through
the
whole
town
in
the
direction
of
mount
adaklu
when
that
has
been
done
the
priests
say
that
they
will
now
remove
the
sicknesses
in
the
evening
they
give
public
notice
that
they
are
about
to
go
on
the
road
and
that
therefore
no
one
may
light
a
fire
on
the
hearth
or
eat
food
next
morning
the
women
of
the
town
sweep
out
their
houses
and
hearths
and
deposit
the
sweepings
on
broken
wooden
plates
many
wrap
themselves
in
torn
mats
and
tattered
clothes
others
swathe
themselves
in
grass
and
creepers
while
they
do
so
they
pray
saying
all
ye
sicknesses
that
are
in
our
body
and
plague
us
we
are
come
to
throw
you
when
they
start
to
do
so
the
priest
gives
orders
that
everybody
is
to
scream
once
and
at
the
same
time
to
smite
his
mouth
in
a
moment
they
all
scream
smite
their
mouths
and
run
as
fast
as
they
can
in
the
direction
of
mount
adaklu
as
they
run
they
say
out
out
that
which
kills
anybody
out
ye
evil
spirits
out
and
all
that
causes
our
heads
to
ache
out
anlo
and
adaklu
are
the
places
whither
all
ill
shall
betake
itself
now
on
mount
adaklu
there
grows
a
tree
and
when
the
people
have
come
to
the
tree
they
throw
everything
away
and
return
home
on
their
return
they
wash
themselves
with
the
medicine
which
is
set
forth
in
the
streets
then
they
enter
their
houses
among
the
hos
of
india
the
great
festival
of
the
year
is
the
harvest
home
held
in
january
when
the
granaries
are
full
of
grain
and
the
people
to
use
their
own
expression
are
full
of
devilry
they
have
a
strange
notion
that
at
this
period
men
and
women
are
so
overcharged
with
vicious
propensities
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
person
to
let
off
steam
by
allowing
for
a
time
full
vent
to
the
the
ceremonies
open
with
a
sacrifice
to
the
village
god
of
three
fowls
a
cock
and
two
hens
one
of
which
must
be
black
along
with
them
are
offered
flowers
of
the
palas
tree
bread
made
from
and
sesamum
seeds
these
offerings
are
presented
by
the
village
priest
who
prays
that
during
the
year
about
to
begin
they
and
their
children
may
be
preserved
from
all
misfortune
and
sickness
and
that
they
may
have
seasonable
rain
and
good
crops
prayer
is
also
made
in
some
places
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
at
this
time
an
evil
spirit
is
supposed
to
infest
the
place
and
to
get
rid
of
it
men
women
and
children
go
in
procession
round
and
through
every
part
of
the
village
with
sticks
in
their
hands
as
if
beating
for
game
singing
a
wild
chant
and
shouting
vociferously
till
they
feel
assured
that
the
evil
spirit
must
have
fled
then
they
give
themselves
up
to
feasting
and
drinking
till
they
are
in
a
fit
state
for
the
wild
debauch
which
follows
the
festival
now
becomes
a
saturnale
during
which
servants
forget
their
duty
to
their
masters
children
their
reverence
for
parents
men
their
respect
for
women
and
women
all
notions
of
modesty
delicacy
and
gentleness
they
become
raging
usually
the
hos
are
quiet
and
reserved
in
manner
decorous
and
gentle
to
women
but
during
this
festival
their
natures
appear
to
undergo
a
temporary
change
sons
and
daughters
revile
their
parents
in
gross
language
and
parents
their
children
men
and
women
become
almost
like
animals
in
the
indulgence
of
their
amorous
the
festival
is
not
held
simultaneously
in
all
the
villages
the
time
during
which
it
is
celebrated
in
the
different
villages
of
a
district
may
be
from
a
month
to
six
weeks
and
by
a
preconcerted
arrangement
the
celebration
begins
at
each
village
on
a
different
date
and
lasts
three
or
four
days
so
the
inhabitants
of
each
may
take
part
in
a
long
series
of
orgies
on
these
occasions
the
utmost
liberty
is
given
to
the
girls
who
may
absent
themselves
for
days
with
the
young
men
of
another
village
parents
at
such
times
never
attempt
to
lay
their
daughters
under
any
restraint
the
mundaris
kinsmen
and
neighbours
of
the
hos
keep
the
festival
in
much
the
same
manner
the
resemblance
to
a
saturnale
is
very
complete
as
at
this
festival
the
farm
labourers
are
feasted
by
their
masters
and
allowed
the
utmost
freedom
of
speech
in
addressing
them
it
is
the
festival
of
the
harvest
home
the
termination
of
one
year
s
toil
and
a
slight
respite
from
it
before
they
commence
amongst
some
of
the
hindoo
koosh
tribes
as
among
the
hos
and
mundaris
the
expulsion
of
devils
takes
place
after
harvest
when
the
last
crop
of
autumn
has
been
got
in
it
is
thought
necessary
to
drive
away
evil
spirits
from
the
granaries
a
kind
of
porridge
called
is
eaten
and
the
head
of
the
family
takes
his
matchlock
and
fires
it
into
the
floor
then
going
outside
he
sets
to
work
loading
and
firing
till
his
is
exhausted
while
all
his
neighbours
are
similarly
employed
the
next
day
is
spent
in
rejoicings
in
chitral
this
festival
is
called
on
the
other
hand
the
khonds
of
india
expel
the
devils
at
instead
of
at
harvest
at
this
time
they
worship
pitteri
pennu
the
god
of
increase
and
of
gain
in
every
shape
on
the
first
day
of
the
festival
a
rude
car
is
made
of
a
basket
set
upon
a
few
sticks
tied
upon
bamboo
rollers
for
wheels
the
priest
takes
this
car
first
to
the
house
of
the
lineal
head
of
the
tribe
to
whom
precedence
is
given
in
all
ceremonies
connected
with
agriculture
here
he
receives
a
little
of
each
kind
of
seed
and
some
feathers
he
then
takes
the
car
to
all
the
other
houses
in
the
village
each
of
which
contributes
the
same
things
lastly
the
car
is
conducted
to
a
field
without
the
village
attended
by
all
the
young
men
who
beat
each
other
and
strike
the
air
violently
with
long
sticks
the
seed
thus
carried
out
is
called
the
share
of
the
evil
spirits
spoilers
of
the
these
are
considered
to
be
driven
out
with
the
car
and
when
it
and
its
contents
are
abandoned
to
them
they
are
held
to
have
no
excuse
for
interfering
with
the
rest
of
the
next
day
each
household
kills
a
hog
over
the
seed
for
the
year
and
prays
to
pitteri
pennu
saying
o
pitteri
pennu
this
seed
we
shall
sow
some
of
us
your
suppliants
will
have
a
great
return
some
a
small
return
let
the
least
favoured
have
a
full
basket
let
the
most
favoured
have
many
baskets
give
not
this
seed
to
ant
or
rat
or
hog
let
the
stems
which
shall
spring
from
it
be
so
stout
that
the
earth
shall
tremble
under
them
let
the
rain
find
no
hole
or
outlet
whereby
to
escape
from
our
fields
make
the
earth
soft
like
the
ashes
of
to
him
who
has
no
iron
wherewith
to
shoe
his
plough
make
the
wood
of
the
like
iron
provide
other
food
than
our
seed
for
the
parrot
the
crow
and
all
the
fowls
and
beasts
of
the
jungle
let
not
the
white
ant
destroy
the
roots
nor
the
wild
hog
crush
the
stem
to
get
at
the
fruit
and
make
our
crops
of
all
kinds
have
a
better
flavour
than
that
of
those
of
any
other
the
elders
then
feast
upon
the
hogs
the
young
men
are
excluded
from
the
repast
but
enjoy
the
privilege
of
waylaying
and
pelting
with
their
elders
as
they
return
from
the
feast
upon
the
third
day
the
lineal
head
of
the
tribe
goes
out
and
sows
his
seed
after
which
all
the
rest
may
do
so
in
ranchi
a
district
of
chota
nagpur
in
bengal
a
ceremony
is
performed
every
year
by
one
of
the
clans
to
drive
away
disease
should
it
prove
ineffectual
all
the
villagers
assemble
by
night
and
walk
about
the
village
in
a
body
armed
with
clubs
searching
for
the
disease
everything
they
find
outside
of
the
houses
they
smash
hence
on
that
day
the
people
throw
out
their
chipped
crockery
old
pots
and
pans
and
other
trash
into
the
courtyard
so
that
when
the
search
party
comes
along
they
may
belabour
the
heap
of
rubbish
to
their
heart
s
content
the
crash
of
shattered
crockery
and
the
clatter
of
shivered
pans
indicates
we
are
told
that
the
disease
has
departed
perhaps
it
might
be
more
strictly
accurate
to
say
that
they
have
frightened
it
away
at
all
events
a
very
loud
noise
is
made
so
that
the
disease
may
not
remain
hidden
in
a
village
of
the
mossos
an
aboriginal
tribe
of
china
a
french
traveller
witnessed
the

house
attended
by
a
troop
of
children
their
faces
smeared
with
flour
some
of
whom
carried
torches
and
others
cymbals
while
all
made
a
deafening
noise
after
dancing
a
wild
dance
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
they
entered
the
principal
room
where
the
performers
were
regaled
with
a
draught
of
ardent
spirits
of
which
they
sprinkled
a
few
drops
on
the
floor
then
the
magicians
recited
their
spells
to
oblige
the
evil
spirits
to
quit
the
chamber
and
the
good
spirits
to
enter
it
at
the
end
of
each
phrase
the
children
speaking
for
the
spirits
answered
with
a
shout
we
go
or
we
that
concluded
the
ceremony
in
the
house
and
the
noisy
procession
filed
out
to

upon
a
great
scale
generally
the
time
chosen
for
the
expulsion
is
the
day
of
the
dark
moon
in
the
ninth
month
when
the
demons
have
been
long
unmolested
the
country
is
said
to
be
warm
and
the
priest
issues
orders
to
expel
them
by
force
lest
the
whole
of
bali
should
be
rendered
uninhabitable
on
the
day
appointed

people
of
the
village

principal
temple

at
a
offerings
are
set
out
for
the
devils
after
prayers
have
been
recited
by
the
priests
the
blast
of
a
horn
summons
the
devils
to
partake
of
the
meal
which
has
been
prepared
for
them
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
men
step
forward
and
light
their
torches
at
the
holy
lamp
which
burns
before
the
chief
priest
immediately
afterwards
followed
by
the
bystanders

spread
in
all
directions

through
the
streets
and
lanes

expulsion
of
devils
thus
chased
from
the
houses
the
fiends
flee
to
the
banquet
which
has
been
set
out
for
them
but
here
the
priest
receives
them
with
curses
which
finally
drive
them
from
the
district
when
the
last
devil
has
taken
his
departure
the
uproar
is
succeeded
by
a
dead
silence
which
lasts
during
the
next
day
also
the
devils
it
is
thought
are
anxious
to
return
to
their
old
homes
and
in
order
to
make
them
think
that
bali
is
not
bali
but
some
desert
island
no
one
may
stir
from
his
own
abode

hung
at
all
the

strangers
from

even
then
it

witnessed
by
the
english

sladen
on
the
thirteenth
of
august
bullocks
and
cows
were
slaughtered
in
the
the
meat
was
all
sold

of
it
was
cooked
and
eaten
while
the
rest
was
fired
out
of
guns
at
sundown
the
pieces
of
flesh
which
fell
on
the
land
were
supposed
to
become
mosquitoes
those
which
fell
in
the
water
were
believed
to
turn
into
leeches
in
the
evening
the
chief
s
retainers
beat
gongs
and
blew
trumpets
and
when
darkness
had
set
in
torches
were
lit
and
a
party
preceded
by
the
musicians
searched
the
central
court
for
the
who
is
supposed
to
lurk
about
at
this
season
with
evil
intent
they
then
ransacked
all
the
rooms
and
the
gardens
throwing
the
light
of
the
torches
into
every
nook
and
corner
where
the
evil
spirit
might
find
a
in
some
parts
of
fiji
an
annual
ceremony
took
place
which
has
much
the
aspect
of
an
expulsion
of
devils
the
time
of
its
celebration
was
determined
by
the
appearance
of
a
certain
fish
or
which
swarms
out
in
dense
shoals
from
the
coral
reefs
on
a
single
day
of
the
year
usually
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
moon
in
november
the
appearance
of
the
was
the
signal
for
a
general
feast
at
those
places
where
they
were
taken
an
influential
man
ascended
a
tree
and
prayed
to
the
spirit
of
the
sky
for
good
crops
fair
winds
and
so
on
thereupon
a
tremendous
clatter
with
drumming
and
shouting
was
raised
by
all
the
people
in
their
houses
for
about
half
an
hour
this
was
followed
by
a
dead
quiet
for
four
days
during
which
the
people
feasted
on
the
all
this
time
no
work
of
any
kind
might
be
done
not
even
a
leaf
plucked
nor
the
offal
removed
from
the
houses
if
a
noise
was
made
in
any
house
as
by
a
child
crying
a
forfeit
was
at
once
exacted
by
the
chief
at
daylight
on
the
expiry
of
the
fourth
night
the
whole
town
was
in
an
uproar
men
and
boys
scampered
about
knocking
with
clubs
and
sticks
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
and
crying
sinariba
this
concluded
the
ceremony

at
this
season
they
observe
a
curious
ceremony
which
may
perhaps
be
explained
as
an
expulsion
of
evils
or
demons
the
lads
and
sometimes
grown
men
with
them
go
in
troops
into
the
forest
to
search
for
when
they
have
collected
a
store
of
these
arrows
they
take
sides
and
armed
with
little
bows
engage
in
a
regular
battle
the
arrows
fly
as
thick
as
hail
and
though
no
one
is
killed
many
receive
skin
wounds
and
are
covered
with
blood
the
catholic
missionary
who
reports
the
custom
could
not
ascertain
the
reasons
for
observing
it
perhaps
one
set
of
combatants
represents
the
demons
or
embodied
evils
of
the
year
who
are
defeated
and
driven
away
by
the
champions
of
the
people
the
month
in
which
these
combats
take
place
november
and
the
beginning
of
december
is
sometimes
named
after
the
and
sometimes
after
the
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
there
is
observed
in
most
japanese
houses
a
ceremony
called
the
exorcism
of
the
evil
it
is
performed
by
the
head
of
the
family
clad
in
his
finest
robes
with
a
sword
if
he
has
the
right
of
bearing
one
at
his
waist
he
goes
through
all
the
rooms
at
the
hour
of
midnight
carrying
in
his
left
hand
a
box
of
roasted
beans
on
a
lacquered
stand
from
time
to
time
he
dips
his
right
hand
into
the
box
and
scatters
a
handful
of
beans
on
a
mat
pronouncing
a
cabalistic
form
of
words
of
which
the
meaning
is
go
forth
demons
enter
riches
according
to
another
account
the
ceremony
takes
place
on
the
night
before
the
beginning
of
spring
and
the
roasted
beans
are
flung
against
the
walls
as
well
as
on
the
floors
of
the
houses
while
the
duty
of
expelling
the
devils
should
strictly
speaking
be
discharged
by
the
head
of
the
house
it
is
often
delegated
to
a
servant
whether
master
or
servant
the
performer
goes
by
the
name
of
the
rite
being
properly
performed
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
words
out
with
the
devils
ha
are
pronounced
by
him
in
a
loud
voice
but
the
words
in
with
the
luck
ha
in
a
low
tone
in
the
shogun
s
palace
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
a
specially
appointed
for
the
purpose
who
scattered
parched
beans
in
all
the
principal
rooms
these
beans
were
picked
up
by
the
women
of
the
palace
who
wrapped
as
many
of
them
in
paper
as
they
themselves
were
years
old
and
then
flung
them
backwards
out
of
doors
sometimes
people
who
had
reached
an
unlucky
year
would
gather
these
beans
one
for
each
year
of
their
life
and
one
over
and
wrap
them
in
paper
together
with
a
small
copper
coin
which
had
been
rubbed
over
their
body
to
transfer
the
the
packet
was
afterwards
thrown
away
at
a
this
was
called
flinging
away
according
to
lafcadio
hearn
the
of
devils
from
the
houses
is
performed
by
a
professional
exorciser
for
a
small
fee
and
the
peas
which
he
scatters
about
the
house
are
afterwards
swept
up
and
carefully
kept
until
the
first
peal
of
thunder
is
heard
in
spring
when
it
is
customary
to
cook
and
eat
some
of
them
after
the
demons
have
been
thoroughly
expelled
from
a
house
a
charm
is
set
up
over
the
door
to
prevent
them
from
returning
it
consists
of
a
wooden
skewer
with
a
holly
leaf
and
the
dried
head
of
a
fish
like
a
sardine
stuck
on
it
on
the
third
day
of
the
tenth
month
in
every
year
the
a
native
race
in
the
province
of
canton
sweep
their
houses
and
turn
the
accumulated
filth
out
of
doors
together
with
three
sticks
of
incense
and
some
mock
money
made
of
paper
at
the
same
time
they
call
out
let
the
devil
of
poverty
depart
let
the
devil
of
poverty
depart
by
performing
this
ceremony
they
hope
to
preserve
their
homes
from
penury
among
some
of
the
hindoos
of
the
punjaub
on
the
morning
after
diwali
or
the
festival
of
lamps
at
which
the
souls
of
ancestors
are
believed
to
visit
the
house
the
oldest
woman
of
the
family
takes
a
or
winnowing
basket
and
a
broom
to
both
of
which
magical
virtues
are
ascribed
and
beats
them
in
every
corner
of
the
house
exclaiming
god
abide
and
poverty
depart
the
sieve
is
then
carried
out
of
the
village
generally
to
the
east
or
north
and
being
thrown
away
is
supposed
to
bear
away
with
it
the
poverty
and
distress
of
the
household
or
the
woman
flings
all
the
sweepings
and
rubbish
out
of
doors
saying
let
all
dirt
and
wretchedness
depart
from
here
and
all
good
fortune
come
the
persians
used
annually
to
expel
the
demons
or
goblins
from
their
houses
in
the
month
of
december
for
this
purpose
the
magi
wrote
certain
words
with
saffron
on
a
piece
of
parchment
or
paper
and
then
held
the
writing
over
a
fire
into
which
they
threw
cotton
garlic
grapes
wild
rue
and
the
horn
of
an
animal
that
had
been
killed
on
the
sixteenth
of
september
the
spell
thus
prepared
was
nailed
or
glued
to
the
inside
of
the
door
and
the
door
was
painted
red
next
the
priest
took
some
sand
and
spread
it
out
with
a
knife
while
he
muttered
certain
prayers
after
that
he
strewed
the
sand
on
the
floor
and
the
enchantment
was
complete
the
demons
now
immediately
vanished
or
at
least
were
deprived
of
all
their
malignant
power
for
ages
it
has
been
customary
in
china
to
expel
the
demons
from
house
and
home
from
towns
and
cities
at
the
end
of
every
year
such
general
expulsions
of
devils
go
by
the
name
of
they
are
often
mentioned
and
described
in
chinese
literature
for
example
under
the
han
dynasty
in
the
second
century
of
our
era
it
was
ordered
that
with
four
eyes
of
gold
masked
with
bearskins
and
wearing
black
coats
with
red
skirts
bearing
lances
and
brandishing
shields
should
always
perform
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
the
twelfth
month
the
of
the
season
in
the
rear
of
hundreds
of
official
servants
and
boys
and
search
the
interior
of
the
palace
in
order
to
expel
the
demons
of
plague
with
bows
of
peach
wood
and
arrows
of
the
thorny
jujube
they
shoot
at
the
spectres
and
with
porcelain
drums
they
drum
at
them
moreover
they
throw
red
balls
and
cereals
at
them
in
order
to
remove
disease
and
again
in
a
poem
of
the
same
period
we
read
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
great
takes
place
for
the
purpose
of
driving
off
all
spectres
the
carry
their
spears
and
hold
their
bundles
of
reed
ten
thousand
lads
with
red
heads
and
black
clothes
with
bows
of
peach
wood
and
arrows
of
thorny
jujube
shoot
at
random
all
around
showers
of
potsherds
and
pebbles
come
down
like
rain
infallibly
killing
strong
spectres
as
well
as
the
weak
flaming
torches
run
after
these
beings
so
that
a
sparkling
and
streaming
glare
chases
the
red
plague
to
all
sides
thereupon
they
destroy
them
in
the
imperial
moats
and
break
down
the
suspension
bridges
to
prevent
their
return
at
a
later
period
chinese
historians
inform
us
that
the
house
of
tsi
caused
the
annual
expulsion
of
demons
to
be
performed
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
by
two
groups
each
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
lads
and
twelve
animals
headed
by
drums
and
wind
instruments
the
gates
of
the
wards
and
of
the
city
walls
were
flung
open
and
the
emperor
witnessed
the
ceremony
seated
on
his
throne
in
the
midst
of
his
officers
with
rolling
drums
the
procession
entered
the
palace
through
the
western
gate
and
passed
through
all
parts
of
it
in
two
divisions
even
ascending
the
towers
while
they
hopped
jumped
and
shrieked
and
on
quitting
the
palace
they
spread
out
in
six
directions
till
they
reached
the
city
walls
at
the
present
time
it
is
customary
in
every
part
of
china
to
fire
off
crackers
on
the
last
day
and
night
of
the
year
for
the
purpose
of
terrifying
and
expelling
the
devils
enormous
quantities
of
the
explosives
are
consumed
at
this
season
the
people
seem
to
vie
with
one
another
as
to
who
shall
let
off
the
most
crackers
and
make
the
most
noise
sometimes
long
strings
of
these
fireworks
hang
from
balconies
and
eaves
and
keep
up
a
continuous
crackling
for
half
an
hour
together
or
more
in
great
cities
the
prolonged
and
din
is
very
annoying
to
foreigners
to
the
ears
of
the
chinese
the
noise
appears
to
be
agreeable
if
not
for
its
own
sake
at
least
for
the
beneficial
effect
it
is
supposed
to
produce
by
driving
demons
away
indeed
they
seem
to
be
of
opinion
that
any
noise
provided
it
be
sufficiently
harsh
and
loud
serves
this
useful
purpose
the
sound
of
brass
instruments
is
particularly
terrifying
to
devils
hence
the
great
use
which
the
chinese
make
of
gongs
in
rites
of
exorcism
the
clash
of
gongs
we
are
told
resounds
through
the
chinese
empire
daily
especially
in
summer
when
a
rise
in
the
which
ignorant
europeans
attribute
to
mere
climatic
influences
stimulates
the
people
to
redouble
their
efforts
for
the
banishment
of
the
fiends
who
are
the
real
cause
of
all
the
mischief
at
such
times
you
may
see
and
hear
groups
of
benevolent
and
men
and
women
banging
gongs
clashing
cymbals
and
drubbing
drums
for
hours
together
no
protest
is
made
by
their
neighbours
no
complaint
that
they
disturb
the
night
s
rest
of
the
sick
and
the
tired
people
listen
with
resignation
or
rather
with
gratitude
and
complacency
to
the
deafening
uproar
raised
by
these
generous
philanthropists
who
thus
devote
their
services
gratuitously
to
the
cause
of
the
public
health
in
corea
also
the
devils
are
driven
out
of
the
towns
on
new
year
s
eve
by
the
firing
of
guns
and
the
popping
of
crackers
in
tonquin
a
or
general
expulsion
of
malevolent
spirits
commonly
took
place
once
a
year
especially
if
there
was
a
great
mortality
amongst
men
the
elephants
or
horses
of
the
general
s
stable
or
the
cattle
of
the
country
the
cause
of
which
they
attribute
to
the
malicious
spirits
of
such
men
as
have
been
put
to
death
for
treason
rebellion
and
conspiring
the
death
of
the
king
general
or
princes
and
that
in
revenge
of
the
punishment
they
have
suffered
they
are
bent
to
destroy
everything
and
commit
horrible
violence
to
prevent
which
their
superstition
has
suggested
to
them
the
institution
of
this
as
a
proper
means
to
drive
the
devil
away
and
purge
the
country
of
evil
the
day
appointed
for
the
ceremony
was
generally
the
of
february
one
month
after
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
which
fell
on
the
of
january
the
intermediate
month
was
a
season
of
feasting
of
all
kinds
and
general
licence
during
the
whole
month
the
great
seal
was
kept
shut
up
in
a
box
face
downwards
and
the
law
was
as
it
were
laid
asleep
all
courts
of
justice
were
closed
debtors
could
not
be
seized
small
crimes
such
as
petty
larceny
fighting
and
assault
escaped
with
impunity
only
treason
and
murder
were
taken
account
of
and
the
malefactors
detained
till
the
great
seal
should
come
into
operation
again
at
the
close
of
the
saturnalia
the
wicked
spirits
were
driven
away
great
masses
of
troops
and
artillery
having
been
drawn
up
with
flying
colours
and
all
the
pomp
of
war
the
general
beginneth
then
to
offer
meat
offerings
to
the
criminal
devils
and
malevolent
spirits
for
it
is
usual
and
customary
likewise
amongst
them
to
feast
the
condemned
before
their
execution
inviting
them
to
eat
and
drink
when
presently
he
accuses
them
in
a
strange
language
by
characters
and
figures
of
many
offences
and
crimes
committed
by
them
as
to
their
having
disquieted
the
land
killed
his
elephants
and
horses
for
all
which
they
justly
deserve
to
be
chastised
and
banished
the
country
whereupon
three
great
guns
are
fired
as
the
last
signal
upon
which
all
the
artillery
and
musquets
are
discharged
that
by
their
most
terrible
noise
the
devils
may
be
driven
away
and
they
are
so
blind
as
to
believe
for
certain
that
they
really
and
effectually
put
them
to
in
cambodia
the
expulsion
of
evil
spirits
took
place
in
march
bits
of
broken
statues
and
stones
considered
as
the
abode
of
the
demons
were
collected
and
brought
to
the
capital
here
as
many
elephants
were
collected
as
could
be
got
together
on
the
evening
of
the
full
moon
volleys
of
musketry
were
fired
and
the
elephants
charged
furiously
to
put
the
devils
to
flight
the
ceremony
was
performed
on
three
successive
days
in
siam
the
banishment
of
demons
is
annually
carried
into
effect
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
a
signal
gun
is
fired
from
the
palace
it
is
answered
from
the
next
station
and
so
on
from
station
to
station
till
the
firing
has
reached
the
outer
gate
of
the
city
thus
the
demons
are
driven
out
step
by
step
as
soon
as
this
is
done
a
consecrated
rope
is
fastened
round
the
circuit
of
the
city
walls
to
prevent
the
banished
demons
from
returning
the
rope
is
made
of
tough
and
is
painted
in
alternate
stripes
of
red
yellow
and
blue
according
to
a
more
recent
account
the
siamese
ceremony
takes
place
at
the
new
year
holidays
which
are
three
in
number
beginning
with
the
first
of
april
for
the
feasting
which
accompanies
these
holidays
a
special
kind
of
cake
is
made
which
is
as
much
in
demand
as
our
own
pancakes
or
our
hot
the
temples
are
thronged
with
women
and
children
making
offerings
to
buddha
and
his
priests
the
people
inaugurate
their
new
year
with
numerous
charitable
and
religious
deeds
the
rich
entertain
the
monks
who
recite
appropriate
prayers
and
chants
every
departed
soul
returns
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
during
these
three
days
freed
from
any
fetters
that
may
have
bound
him
in
the
regions
of
indefinable
locality
on
the
third
day
the
religious
observances
terminate
and
the
remaining
hours
are
devoted
to
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
gambling
is
not
confined
to
the
licensed
houses
but
may
be
indulged
in
anywhere
games
of
chance
hold
powerful
sway
in
every
house
as
long
as
the
licence
to
participate
in
them
lasts
priests
in
small
companies
occupy
posts
at
regular
intervals
round
the
city
wall
and
spend
their
time
in
chanting
away
the
evil
spirits
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
the
ghostly
visitors
from
the
lower
realms
lose
the
luxury
of
being
exorcised
with
psalms
every
person
who
has
a
gun
may
fire
it
as
often
as
he
pleases
and
the
noise
thus
made
is
undoubtedly
fearful
enough
in
its
intensity
to
cause
any
wandering
traveller
from
the
fiery
land
to
retrace
his
steps
with
speed
the
bang
and
rattle
of
pistols
muskets
and
rifles
cease
not
till
the
break
of
day
by
which
time
the
city
is
effectually
cleared
of
all
its
infernal
from
this
account
we
learn
that
among
the
spirits
thus
banished
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
revisit
their
living
friends
once
a
year
to
the
same
effect
apparently
bishop
bruguière
writing
from
bangkok
in
tells
us
that
the
three
first
days
of
the
moon
of
april
are
days
of
solemn
festivity
for
the
pious
siamese
that
day
lucifer
opens
all
the
gates
of
the
abyss
the
souls
of
the
dead
which
are
shut
up
there
come
forth
and
partake
of
a
repast
in
the
bosom
of
their
family
they
are
treated
splendidly
one
of
these
three
days
a
monk
repairs
to
the
palace
to
preach
before
the
king
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
a
preconcerted
signal
is
given
and
in
a
moment
the
cannons
are
fired
in
all
the
quarters
of
the
city
to
chase
the
devil
out
of
the
walls
or
to
kill
him
if
he
dares
to
resist
on
the
first
day
a
temporary
king
is
named
who
bears
the
title
of
during
these
three
days
he
enjoys
all
the
royal
prerogatives
the
real
king
remaining
shut
up
in
his
a
similar
belief
and
a
similar
custom
prevail
in
japan
there
too
the
souls
of
the
departed
return
to
their
old
homes
once
a
year
and
a
festival
called
the
feast
of
lanterns
is
made
to
welcome
them
they
come
at
evening
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
seventh
month
of
the
old
calendar
which
falls
towards
the
end
of
august
it
is
needful
to
light
them
on
their
way
accordingly
bamboos
with
pretty
coloured
lanterns
attached
to
them
are
fastened
on
the
tombs
and
being
thickly
set
they
make
an
illumination
on
the
hills
where
the
are
generally
situated
lamps
of
many
hues
or
rows
of
tapers
are
also
lit
and
set
out
in
front
of
the
houses
and
in
the
gardens
and
small
fires
are
kindled
in
the
streets
so
that
the
whole
city
is
in
a
blaze
of
light
after
the
sun
has
set
a
great
multitude
issues
from
the
town
for
every
family
goes
forth
to
meet
its
returning
dead
when
they
come
to
the
spot
where
they
believe
the
souls
to
be
they
welcome
the
unseen
visitors
and
invite
them
to
rest
after
their
journey
and
to
partake
of
refreshments
which
they
offer
to
them
having
allowed
the
souls
time
enough
to
satisfy
their
hunger
and
recover
from
their
fatigue
they
escort
them
by
torchlight
chatting
gaily
with
them
into
the
city
and
to
the
houses
where
they
lived
and
died
these
are
also
illuminated
with
brilliant
lanterns
a
banquet
is
spread
on
the
tables
and
the
places
of
the
dead
who
are
supposed
to
absorb
the
ethereal
essence
of
the
food
are
laid
for
them
as
if
they
were
alive
after
the
repast
the
living
go
from
house
to
house
to
visit
the
souls
of
their
dead
friends
and
neighbours
and
thus
they
spend
the
night
running
about
the
town
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
of
the
festival
which
is
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
the
time
has
come
for
the
souls
to
return
to
their
own
place
fires
again
blaze
in
the
streets
to
light
them
on
the
road
the
people
again
escort
them
ceremoniously
to
the
spot
where
they
met
them
two
days
before
and
in
some
places
they
send
the
lanterns
floating
away
on
rivers
or
the
sea
in
miniature
boats
which
are
laden
with
provisions
for
the
spirits
on
their
way
to
their
long
home
but
there
is
still
a
fear
that
some
poor
souls
may
have
lagged
behind
or
even
concealed
themselves
in
a
nook
or
corner
loth
to
part
from
the
scenes
of
their
former
life
and
from
those
they
love
accordingly
steps
are
taken
to
hunt
out
these
laggards
and
send
them
packing
after
their
with
this
intention
the
people
throw
stones
on
the
roofs
of
their
houses
in
great
profusion
and
going
through
every
room
armed
with
sticks
they
deal
swashing
blows
all
about
them
in
the
empty
air
to
chase
away
the
lingering
souls
this
they
do
we
are
told
out
of
a
regard
for
their
own
comfort
quite
as
much
as
from
the
affection
they
bear
to
the
dead
for
they
fear
to
be
disturbed
by
unseasonable
apparitions
if
they
suffered
the
airy
visitors
to
remain
in
the
house
thus
in
spite
of
the
kindly
welcome
given
to
the
souls
the
fear
which
they
inspire
comes
out
plainly
in
the
pains
taken
to
ensure
their
departure
and
this
fear
justifies
us
in
including
such
forced
departures
among
the
ceremonies
for
the
expulsion
of
evils
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
annual
banishment
of
ghosts
has
been
practised
by
savages
so
low
in
the
scale
of
humanity
as
the
australian
aborigines
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
it
was
observed
in
classical
antiquity
by
the
civilized
greeks
and
romans
the
athenians
believed
that
at
the
festival
of
the
anthesteria
the
souls
of
the
dead
came
back
from
the
nether
world
and
went
about
the
city
accordingly
ropes
were
fastened
round
the
temples
to
keep
out
the
wandering
ghosts
and
with
a
like
intention
the
people
chewed
buckthorn
in
the
morning
and
smeared
the
doors
of
their
houses
with
pitch
apparently
thinking
that
any
rash
spirits
who
might
attempt
to
enter
would
stick
fast
in
the
pitch
and
be
glued
like
so
many
flies
to
the
door
but
at
the
end
of
the
festival
the
souls
were
bidden
to
depart
in
these
words
out
of
the
door
with
you
souls
the
anthesteria
is
yet
for
the
entertainment
of
the
unseen
guests
during
their
short
stay
earthenware
pots
full
of
boiled
food
appear
to
have
been
everywhere
prepared
throughout
the
city
but
probably
these
were
placed
in
the
street
outside
the
houses
in
order
to
give
the
ghosts
no
excuse
for
entering
and
disturbing
the
inmates
no
priest
would
eat
of
the
food
thus
offered
to
the
dead
but
prowling
beggars
probably
had
no
such
scruples
similarly
when
the
sea
dyaks
of
sarawak
celebrate
their
great
festival
of
departed
spirits
at
intervals
which
vary
from
one
to
three
or
four
years
food
is
prepared
for
the
dead
and
they
are
summoned
from
their
home
to
partake
of
it
but
it
is
put
outside
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
and
before
the
general
arrival
of
the
souls
while
the
people
are
busy
brewing
the
drink
for
the
feast
each
family
takes
care
to
hang
an
earthenware
pot
full
of
the
liquor
outside
of
the
single
room
which
it
occupies
in
the
large
common
house
lest
some
thirsty
soul
should
arrive
prematurely
from
the
other
world
and
forcing
his
way
into
the
domestic
circle
should
not
merely
slake
his
thirst
but
carry
off
one
of
the
living
during
three
days
in
may
the
romans
held
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
ghosts
the
temples
were
shut
doubtless
to
keep
out
the
ghostly
swarms
but
as
in
japan
every
house
seems
to
have
been
thrown
open
to
receive
the
spirits
of
its
own
departed
when
the
reception
was
over
each
head
of
a
family
arose
at
dead
of
night
washed
his
hands
and
having
made
with
fingers
and
thumb
certain
magic
signs
to
ward
off
ghosts
he
proceeded
to
throw
black
beans
over
his
shoulder
without
looking
behind
him
as
he
did
so
he
said
nine
times
with
these
beans
i
redeem
me
and
mine
and
the
ghosts
following
unseen
at
his
heels
picked
up
the
beans
and
left
him
and
his
alone
then
he
dipped
his
hands
again
in
water
clashed
bronze
vessels
together
to
make
a
din
and
begged
the
ghosts
to
depart
from
his
house
saying
nine
times
go
forth
paternal
shades
after
that
he
looked
behind
him
and
the
ceremony
was
over
the
ghosts
had
taken
their
leave
for
another
year
annual
expulsions
of
demons
witches
or
evil
influences
appear
to
have
been
common
among
the
heathen
of
europe
if
we
may
judge
from
the
relics
of
such
customs
among
their
descendants
at
the
present
day
thus
among
the
heathen
wotyaks
a
finnish
people
of
eastern
russia
all
the
young
girls
of
the
village
assemble
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
or
on
new
year
s
day
armed
with
sticks
the
ends
of
which
are
split
in
nine
places
with
these
they
beat
every
corner
of
the
house
and
yard
saying
we
are
driving
satan
out
of
the
afterwards
the
sticks
are
thrown
into
the
river
below
the
village
and
as
they
float
down
stream
satan
goes
with
them
to
the
next
village
from
which
he
must
be
driven
out
in
turn
in
some
villages
the
expulsion
is
managed
otherwise
the
unmarried
men
receive
from
every
house
in
the
village
groats
flesh
and
brandy
these
they
take
to
the
fields
light
a
fire
under
a
boil
the
groats
and
eat
of
the
food
they
have
brought
with
them
after
pronouncing
the
words
go
away
into
the
wilderness
come
not
into
the
then
they
return
to
the
village
and
enter
every
house
where
there
are
young
women
they
take
hold
of
the
young
women
and
throw
them
into
the
snow
saying
may
the
spirits
of
disease
leave
the
remains
of
the
groats
and
the
other
food
are
then
distributed
among
all
the
houses
in
proportion
to
the
amount
that
each
contributed
and
each
family
consumes
its
share
according
to
a
wotyak
of
the
malmyz
district
the
young
men
throw
into
the
snow
whomever
they
find
in
the
houses
and
this
is
called
driving
out
satan
moreover
some
of
the
boiled
groats
are
cast
into
the
fire
with
the
words
o
god
afflict
us
not
with
sickness
and
pestilence
give
us
not
up
as
a
prey
to
the
spirits
of
the
but
the
most
antique
form
of
the
ceremony
is
that
observed
by
the
wotyaks
of
the
kasan
government
first
of
all
a
sacrifice
is
offered
to
the
devil
at
noon
then
all
the
men
assemble
on
horseback
in
the
centre
of
the
village
and
decide
with
which
house
they
shall
begin
when
this
question
which
often
gives
rise
to
hot
disputes
is
settled
they
tether
their
horses
to
the
paling
and
arm
themselves
with
whips
clubs
of
and
bundles
of
lighted
twigs
the
lighted
twigs
are
believed
to
have
the
greatest
terrors
for
satan
thus
armed
they
proceed
with
frightful
cries
to
beat
every
corner
of
the
house
and
yard
then
shut
the
door
and
spit
at
the
ejected
fiend
so
they
go
from
house
to
house
till
the
devil
has
been
driven
from
every
one
then
they
mount
their
horses
and
ride
out
of
the
village
yelling
wildly
and
brandishing
their
clubs
in
every
direction
outside
of
the
village
they
fling
away
the
clubs
and
spit
once
more
at
the
devil
the
cheremiss
another
finnish
people
of
eastern
russia
chase
satan
from
their
dwellings
by
beating
the
walls
with
cudgels
of
for
the
same
purpose
they
fire
guns
stab
the
ground
with
knives
and
insert
burning
chips
of
wood
in
the
crevices
also
they
leap
over
bonfires
shaking
out
their
garments
as
they
do
so
and
in
some
districts
they
blow
on
long
trumpets
of
bark
to
frighten
him
away
when
he
has
fled
to
the
wood
they
pelt
the
trees
with
some
of
the
and
eggs
which
furnished
the
feast
in
christian
europe
the
old
heathen
custom
of
expelling
the
powers
of
evil
at
certain
times
of
the
year
has
survived
to
modern
times
thus
in
some
villages
of
calabria
the
month
of
march
is
inaugurated
with
the
expulsion
of
the
witches
it
takes
place
at
night
to
the
sound
of
the
church
bells
the
people
running
about
the
streets
and
crying
march
is
they
say
that
the
witches
roam
about
in
march
and
the
ceremony
is
repeated
every
friday
evening
during
the
month
often
as
might
have
been
anticipated
the
ancient
pagan
rite
has
attached
itself
to
church
festivals
for
example
in
calabria
at
eastertide
every
family
provides
itself
in
time
with
a
supply
of
holy
water
and
when
the
church
bells
proclaim
the
resurrection
of
christ
the
people
sprinkle
the
house
with
the
water
saying
in
a
loud
voice
fora
sùrici
uorvi
esciti
fora
tentaziuni
esca
u
malu
ed
entri
u
at
the
same
time
they
knock
on
doors
and
windows
on
chests
and
other
articles
of
furniture
again
in
albania
on
easter
eve
the
young
people
light
torches
of
resinous
wood
and
march
in
procession
swinging
them
through
the
village
at
last
they
throw
the
torches
into
the
river
crying
ha
kore
we
throw
you
into
the
river
like
these
torches
that
you
may
never
silesian
peasants
believe
that
on
good
friday
the
witches
go
their
rounds
and
have
great
power
for
mischief
hence
about
oels
near
strehlitz
the
people
on
that
day
arm
themselves
with
old
brooms
and
drive
the
witches
from
house
and
home
from
farmyard
and
making
a
great
uproar
and
clatter
as
they
do
so
the
belief
in
the
maleficent
power
and
activity
of
witches
and
wizards
would
seem
to
have
weighed
almost
as
heavily
on
the
heathen
of
central
and
northern
europe
in
prehistoric
times
as
it
still
weighs
on
the
minds
of
african
negroes
and
other
savages
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
while
these
unhallowed
beings
were
always
with
our
forefathers
there
were
times
and
seasons
of
the
year
when
they
were
supposed
to
be
particularly
mischievous
and
when
accordingly
special
precautions
had
to
be
taken
against
them
among
such
times
were
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
twelfth
night
the
eve
of
george
the
eve
of
may
day
walpurgis
night
and
midsummer
eve
in
central
europe
it
was
apparently
on
walpurgis
night
the
eve
of
may
day
above
all
other
times
that
the
baleful
powers
of
the
witches
were
exerted
to
the
fullest
extent
nothing
therefore
could
be
more
natural
than
that
men
should
be
on
their
guard
against
them
at
that
season
and
that
not
content
with
merely
standing
on
their
defence
they
should
boldly
have
sought
to
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
s
quarters
by
attacking
and
forcibly
expelling
the
uncanny
crew
amongst
the
weapons
with
which
they
fought
their
invisible
adversaries
in
these
grim
encounters
were
holy
water
the
fumes
of
incense
or
other
combustibles
and
loud
noises
of
all
kinds
particularly
the
clashing
of
metal
instruments
amongst
which
the
ringing
of
church
bells
was
perhaps
the
most
effectual
some
of
these
strong
measures
are
still
in
use
among
the
peasantry
or
were
so
down
to
recent
years
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
suppose
that
their
magical
virtue
has
been
at
all
impaired
by
lapse
of
time
in
the
tyrol
as
in
other
places
the
expulsion
of
the
powers
of
evil
at
this
season
goes
by
the
name
of
burning
out
the
it
takes
place
on
may
day
but
people
have
been
busy
with
their
preparations
for
days
before
on
a
thursday
at
midnight
bundles
are
made
up
of
resinous
splinters
black
and
red
spotted
hemlock
caperspurge
rosemary
and
twigs
of
the
sloe
these
are
kept
and
burned
on
may
day
by
men
who
must
first
have
received
plenary
absolution
from
the
church
on
the
last
three
days
of
april
all
the
houses
are
cleansed
and
fumigated
with
juniper
berries
and
rue
on
may
day
when
the
evening
bell
has
rung
and
the
twilight
is
falling
the
ceremony
of
burning
out
the
witches
begins
men
and
boys
make
a
racket
with
whips
bells
pots
and
pans
the
women
carry
censers
the
dogs
are
unchained
and
run
barking
and
yelping
about
as
soon
as
the
church
bells
begin
to
ring
the
bundles
of
twigs
fastened
on
poles
are
set
on
fire
and
the
incense
is
ignited
then
all
the
and
are
rung
pots
and
pans
are
clashed
dogs
bark
every
one
must
make
a
noise
and
amid
this
hubbub
all
scream
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
flee
flee
from
here
it
will
go
ill
with
then
they
run
seven
times
round
the
houses
the
yards
and
the
village
so
the
witches
are
smoked
out
of
their
and
driven
away
the
custom
of
expelling
the
witches
on
walpurgis
night
is
still
or
was
down
to
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
observed
in
many
parts
of
bavaria
and
among
the
germans
of
bohemia
thus
in
the
böhmerwald
mountains
which
divide
bavaria
from
bohemia
all
the
young
fellows
of
the
village
assemble
after
sunset
on
some
height
especially
at
a
and
crack
whips
for
a
while
in
unison
with
all
their
strength
this
drives
away
the
witches
for
so
far
as
the
sound
of
the
whips
is
heard
these
maleficent
beings
can
do
no
harm
the
peasants
believe
firmly
in
the
efficacy
of
this
remedy
a
yokel
will
tell
his
sons
to
be
sure
to
crack
their
whips
loudly
and
hit
the
witches
hard
and
to
give
more
sting
to
every
blow
the
are
knotted
on
returning
to
the
village
the
lads
often
sing
songs
and
collect
contributions
of
eggs
lard
bread
and
butter
in
some
places
while
the
young
fellows
are
cracking
their
whips
the
herdsmen
wind
their
horns
and
the
notes
heard
in
the
silence
of
night
are
very
effectual
for
banning
the
witches
in
other
places
again
the
youth
blow
upon
shawms
made
of
peeled
in
front
of
every
house
especially
in
front
of
such
houses
as
are
suspected
of
harbouring
a
witch
in
voigtland
a
bleak
mountainous
region
of
central
germany
bordering
on
the
frankenwald
mountains
the
belief
in
witchcraft
is
still
widely
spread
the
time
when
the
witches
are
particularly
dreaded
is
walpurgis
night
but
they
play
their
pranks
also
on
midsummer
eve
thomas
s
eve
and
christmas
eve
on
these
days
they
try
to
make
their
way
into
a
neighbour
s
house
and
to
borrow
or
steal
something
from
it
and
woe
betide
the
man
in
whose
house
they
have
succeeded
in
their
nefarious
errand
it
is
on
walpurgis
night
and
midsummer
eve
that
they
ride
through
the
air
astride
of
pitchforks
and
they
also
bewitch
the
cattle
so
to
protect
the
poor
beasts
from
their
hellish
machinations
the
people
on
these
days
chalk
up
three
crosses
on
the
doors
of
the
or
hang
up
john
s
wort
marjoram
and
so
forth
very
often
too
the
village
youth
turn
out
in
a
body
and
drive
the
witches
away
with
the
cracking
of
whips
the
firing
of
guns
and
the
waving
of
burning
besoms
through
the
air
not
to
mention
shouts
and
noises
of
all
sorts
such
customs
appear
to
be
observed
generally
in
thüringen
of
which
voigtland
is
a
part
the
people
think
that
the
blows
of
the
whip
actually
fall
on
the
witches
hovering
unseen
in
the
air
and
that
so
far
as
the
cracking
of
the
whips
is
heard
the
crops
will
be
good
and
nothing
will
be
struck
by
lightning
no
doubt
because
the
witches
have
been
banished
by
the
sound
in
bohemia
many
are
the
precautions
taken
by
the
peasantry
both
german
and
czech
to
guard
themselves
and
their
cattle
against
the
witches
on
walpurgis
night
thorny
branches
are
laid
on
the
thresholds
of
and
dwellings
to
keep
out
the
infernal
crew
and
after
sunset
boys
armed
with
whips
and
guns
drive
them
from
the
villages
with
a
prodigious
uproar
and
burn
them
in
bonfires
on
the
neighbouring
heights
it
is
true
that
the
witches
themselves
are
not
seen
though
effigies
of
them
are
sometimes
consumed
in
the
bonfires
this
burning
of
the
witches
as
it
is
called
protects
the
crops
from
their
ravages
german
lads
also
employ
goats
horns
as
a
means
of
driving
away
the
witches
at
the
moment
when
they
issue
forth
from
on
their
way
to
the
witches
sabbath
some
minor
variations
in
the
mode
of
expelling
the
witches
on
walpurgis
night
have
been
noted
in
the
german
villages
of
western
bohemia
thus
in
absrot
the
village
youth
go
out
to
and
there
beat
the
ground
with
boards
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
thrashing
the
witches
who
are
commonly
supposed
to
assemble
at
such
spots
in
deslawen
after
the
evening
bells
have
rung
people
go
through
the
houses
beating
the
walls
or
floors
with
boards
then
they
issue
forth
into
the
roads
headed
by
a
boy
who
carries
the
effigy
of
a
witch
made
up
of
rags
thereupon
folk
crack
whips
and
fire
shots
in
schönwert
the
young
people
go
in
bands
through
the
village
and
the
meadows
making
a
great
noise
with
bells
flutes
and
whips
for
the
more
noise
they
make
the
more
effectual
is
the
ceremony
supposed
to
be
meantime
the
older
men
are
busy
firing
shots
over
the
fields
and
the
dungheaps
in
hochofen
troops
of
children
go
from
house
to
house
on
walpurgis
evening
making
a
great
clatter
with
tin
cans
and
kettles
while
they
scream
witch
go
out
your
house
is
this
is
called
driving
out
the
the
german
peasants
of
moravia
also
universally
believe
that
on
walpurgis
night
the
witches
ride
through
the
air
on
broomsticks
and
pitchforks
in
order
to
revel
with
satan
their
master
at
the
old
heathen
places
of
sacrifice
which
are
commonly
on
heights
to
guard
the
cattle
and
horses
from
their
insidious
attacks
it
is
usual
to
put
knives
under
the
thresholds
and
to
stick
sprigs
of
birch
in
the
dungheaps
formerly
lads
used
to
gather
on
the
heights
where
the
witches
were
believed
to
assemble
and
by
hurling
besoms
dipped
in
pitch
and
ignited
they
attempted
to
banish
the
invisible
foe
in
silesia
also
we
are
told
the
belief
in
witchcraft
still
occupies
a
large
space
in
the
minds
of
the
people
it
is
on
walpurgis
night
that
the
witches
are
let
loose
and
all
the
powers
of
magic
have
full
sway
at
that
time
the
cottagers
not
uncommonly
see
a
witch
astride
a
hayfork
or
broomstick
emerging
from
the
chimney
hence
people
are
careful
to
remove
all
utensils
from
the
fireplace
or
the
witches
would
ride
on
them
when
they
go
with
the
evil
one
to
a
or
a
there
to
dance
wild
dances
in
a
circle
on
the
snow
or
to
cut
capers
on
the
steps
are
taken
to
guard
village
house
and
farmyard
against
their
incursions
three
crosses
are
chalked
up
on
every
door
and
little
fastened
over
the
because
the
witches
must
count
every
leaf
on
the
tree
before
they
can
cross
the
threshold
and
while
they
are
still
counting
the
day
breaks
and
their
power
is
gone
on
that
evening
the
cattle
are
especially
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
witches
and
prudent
farmers
resort
to
many
expedients
for
the
sake
of
protecting
the
animals
from
the
wiles
of
these
malignant
beings
no
wise
man
would
sell
milk
or
butter
on
walpurgis
night
if
he
did
his
cows
would
certainly
be
bewitched
and
all
the
work
of
the
byres
should
be
finished
and
the
cattle
fed
before
sundown
which
is
the
time
when
the
witches
begin
to
swarm
in
the
air
besides
the
usual
crosses
chalked
on
the
door
of
the
byre
it
is
customary
to
fasten
over
it
three
or
a
holed
flint
or
a
goat
s
horns
with
four
branches
it
is
well
too
to
nail
bits
of
buckthorn
crosswise
over
every
entrance
and
to
lean
pitchforks
and
harrows
against
the
doors
with
the
sharp
points
turned
outwards
a
sod
freshly
cut
from
a
meadow
and
sprinkled
with
has
likewise
a
very
good
effect
when
it
is
placed
before
a
threshold
moreover
in
the
grünberg
district
young
men
go
clanking
chains
through
the
village
and
farmyards
for
iron
scares
the
witches
also
they
knock
at
the
doors
and
they
prance
through
the
yards
astride
on
pitchforks
and
broomsticks
all
to
drive
away
the
witches
but
in
doing
so
they
must
be
sure
not
to
speak
a
word
a
very
powerful
means
of
keeping
witches
at
bay
are
the
walpurgis
bonfires
which
are
still
kindled
in
the
hoyerswerda
district
and
the
iser
mountains
the
fires
are
fed
with
the
stumps
of
old
brooms
and
the
people
dance
round
them
and
wave
burning
besoms
just
as
they
do
at
the
midsummer
bonfires
about
hoyerswerda
they
call
these
fires
as
usual
burning
the
the
wends
of
saxony
adopt
very
similar
precautions
against
witches
on
the
evening
of
walpurgis
day
any
one
who
has
been
in
lusatia
on
the
last
day
of
april
must
remember
the
fires
which
he
saw
blazing
on
the
mountains
and
in
the
valleys
and
the
plains
that
is
the
for
weeks
before
that
the
boys
and
lads
have
been
collecting
old
brooms
and
when
the
time
comes
they
sally
forth
and
dance
with
the
burning
besoms
on
the
fields
the
fire
is
thought
to
ban
the
witches
and
foul
fiends
also
on
that
day
people
march
about
the
fields
and
meadows
clinking
stones
on
scythes
for
the
noise
is
also
deemed
effectual
in
driving
the
witches
away
at
penzance
in
cornwall
boys
run
about
blowing
horns
on
the
thirtieth
of
april
walpurgis
day
and
when
questioned
why
they
do
so
they
say
that
they
are
scaring
away
the
the
horns
used
for
this
purpose
are
made
of
tin
and
shaped
like
a
herald
s
trumpet
they
vary
in
length
from
a
foot
to
a
yard
and
can
give
forth
a
very
loud
blast
the
custom
is
probably
a
relic
of
a
general
expulsion
of
witches
and
demons
on
that
day
another
witching
time
is
the
period
of
twelve
days
between
christmas
the
of
december
and
epiphany
the
sixth
of
january
a
thousand
quaint
superstitions
cluster
round
that
mystic
season
it
is
then
that
the
wild
huntsman
sweeps
through
the
air
the
powers
of
evil
are
let
loose
werewolves
are
prowling
round
and
the
witches
work
their
wicked
will
hence
in
some
parts
of
silesia
the
people
burn
all
night
long
between
christmas
and
the
new
year
in
order
that
the
pungent
smoke
may
drive
witches
and
evil
spirits
far
away
from
house
and
homestead
and
on
christmas
eve
and
new
year
s
eve
they
fire
shots
over
fields
and
meadows
into
shrubs
and
trees
and
wrap
straw
round
the
to
prevent
the
spirits
from
doing
them
harm
on
new
year
s
eve
which
is
saint
sylvester
s
day
bohemian
lads
armed
with
guns
form
themselves
into
circles
and
fire
thrice
into
the
air
this
is
called
shooting
the
witches
and
is
supposed
to
frighten
the
witches
away
while
the
young
fellows
are
rendering
this
service
to
the
community
the
housewives
go
about
their
houses
sprinkling
holy
water
in
all
the
rooms
and
chalking
three
crosses
on
every
door
no
doubt
to
accelerate
the
departure
of
the
witches
and
to
prevent
their
return
at
trieste
on
sylvester
s
eve
people
form
processions
and
drive
the
evil
spirits
with
sticks
and
brooms
out
of
the
houses
while
they
invite
the
good
spirits
and
good
luck
to
come
and
dwell
there
in
the
town
of
biggar
in
lanarkshire
it
has
been
customary
from
time
immemorial
to
celebrate
a
custom
called
burning
out
the
old
year
on
the
of
december
a
large
bonfire
to
which
all
the
onlookers
think
it
their
duty
to
contribute
fuel
is
kindled
in
the
evening
at
the
town
cross
and
fires
are
also
lighted
on
the
adjacent
hills
when
we
remember
how
common
it
is
in
central
europe
to
kindle
fires
at
critical
seasons
for
the
purpose
of
burning
the
witches
we
may
suspect
that
what
the
good
people
of
biggar
originally
intended
to
burn
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
was
not
the
old
year
but
the
witches
it
would
have
been
well
for
scotland
and
for
europe
if
the
practice
of
burning
witches
had
always
been
carried
out
in
this
harmless
fashion
a
visitor
to
scotland
in
saw
nine
witches
of
flesh
and
blood
burned
at
one
time
on
leith
links
the
last
of
the
mystic
twelve
days
is
epiphany
or
twelfth
night
and
it
has
been
selected
as
a
proper
season
for
the
expulsion
of
the
powers
of
evil
in
various
parts
of
europe
thus
at
brunnen
on
the
lake
of
lucerne
the
boys
go
about
in
procession
on
twelfth
night
carrying
torches
and
lanterns
and
making
a
great
noise
with
horns
whips
and
so
forth
this
is
said
to
frighten
away
the
two
female
spirits
of
the
wood
strudeli
and
strätteli
of
these
two
names
strudeli
seems
to
mean
witch
and
strätteli
the
people
believe
that
if
they
do
not
make
enough
noise
there
will
be
little
fruit
that
year
on
the
same
day
the
inhabitants
of
the
muota
valley
immediately
to
the
east
of
brunnen
used
to
make
a
similar
racket
no
doubt
for
a
similar
purpose
they
collected
chains
pots
and
pans
horns
and
such
like
musical
instruments
he
who
could
borrow
a
number
of
horse
s
bells
and
wear
them
on
his
person
so
that
the
jangling
sounded
afar
off
was
deemed
uncommonly
lucky
thus
equipped
parties
of
people
marched
about
making
all
the
din
they
could
sometimes
they
would
meet
and
joining
all
their
efforts
in
one
concerted
burst
of
harmony
or
discord
would
raise
such
a
hubbub
that
the
surrounding
rocks
rang
again
with
the
sound
in
labruguière
also
a
canton
of
southern
france
the
evil
spirits
are
expelled
at
the
same
season
the
canton
lies
in
the
picturesque
and
region
of
the
black
mountains
which
form
a
sort
of
link
between
the
pyrenees
and
the
cevennes
and
have
preserved
in
their
remote
recesses
certain
types
of
life
which
have
long
disappeared
elsewhere
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
day
the
inhabitants
rush
through
the
streets
jangling
bells
clattering
kettles
and
doing
everything
to
make
a
discordant
noise
then
by
the
light
of
torches
and
blazing
faggots
they
set
up
a
prodigious
hue
and
cry
an
uproar
hoping
thereby
to
chase
all
the
wandering
ghosts
and
devils
from
the
town
with
this
noisy
ceremony
we
may
compare
a
similar
custom
which
is
still
observed
year
by
year
at
the
same
season
in
the
long
and
spacious
piazza
navona
at
rome
there
on
the
night
before
epiphany
a
dense
crowd
assembles
and
diverts
itself
by
raising
a
hideous
uproar
soon
after
supper
troops
of
young
folk
and
others
march
through
the
streets
preceded
by
puppets
or
pasteboard
figures
and
all
making
the
utmost
possible
din
they
converge
from
different
quarters
on
the
piazza
navona
there
to
unite
in
one
prolonged
and
deafening
outburst
of
clangorous
discord
the
favourite
musical
instruments
employed
in
this
cats
concert
are
penny
trumpets
of
which
together
with
tambourines
bells
and
so
forth
the
shops
take
care
to
provide
a
large
stock
as
a
preparation
for
the
pandemonium
of
the
evening
the
ceremony
is
supposed
to
be
in
honour
of
a
certain
mythical
old
hag
called
befana
effigies
of
whom
made
of
rags
are
put
by
women
and
children
in
the
windows
on
twelfth
night
her
name
befana
is
clearly
a
popular
corruption
of
epiphany
the
ecclesiastical
name
of
the
festival
but
viewed
in
connexion
with
the
popular
celebrations
which
we
have
examined
she
may
be
suspected
to
be
of
heathen
rather
than
christian
origin
in
fact
we
may
conjecture
that
she
was
of
old
a
witch
and
that
the
noisy
rite
in
the
piazza
navona
is
nothing
but
a
relic
of
an
annual
expulsion
of
witches
at
this
season
a
ceremony
of
the
same
sort
is
annually
observed
on
the
same
evening
the
eve
of
epiphany
by
the
peasantry
who
inhabit
the
mountains
of
the
tuscan
romagna
a
troop
of
lads
parade
the
streets
of
the
village
making
a
fiendish
noise
by
means
of
bells
and
kitchen
utensils
of
tin
and
brass
while
others
blow
blasts
on
horns
and
they
drag
about
a
cart
containing
an
effigy
of
an
old
woman
made
up
of
rags
and
tow
which
represents
befana
epiphany
when
they
come
to
the
village
square
they
put
fire
to
the
effigy
which
soon
vanishes
in
smoke
and
flames
amid
a
chorus
of
cries
shrieks
and
other
forms
of
rustic
melody
similar
ceremonies
are
probably
observed
on
the
same
evening
in
other
parts
of
italy
in
the
shetland
islands
the
yule
or
christmas
holidays
begin
or
used
to
begin
seven
days
before
christmas
and
last
till
antinmas
that
is
the
day
after

in
the
shetland
parlance
these
holidays
are
known
as
the
on
the
first
night
called
s

en
seven
days
before
christmas
certain
mischievous
elves
whom
the
shetlanders
name
trows
received
permission
to
leave
their
homes
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
and
dwell
if
it
so
pleased
them
above
ground
there
seemed
to
have
been
no
doubt
that
those
creatures
preferred
disporting
themselves
among
the
dwellings
of
men
to
residing
in
their
own
subterranean
abodes
for
they
availed
themselves
of
every
permission
given
and
created
no
little
disturbance
among
the
mortals
whom
they
visited
one
of
the
most
important
of
all
observances
was
the
saining
required
to
guard
life
or
property
from
the
trows
if
the
proper
observances
were
omitted
the
were
sure
to
take
advantage
of
the
on
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
the
day
after
christmas
which
in
shetland
goes
by
the
name
of
uphellia

the
doors
were
all
opened
and
a
great
deal
of
pantomimic
chasing
and
driving
and
dispersing
of
unseen
creatures
took
place
many
pious
ejaculations
were
uttered
and
iron
was
ostentatiously
displayed
for
trows
can
never
abide
the
sight
o
the
bible
was
read
and
quoted
people
moved
about
in
groups
or
couples
never
singly
and
infants
were
carefully
guarded
as
well
as
sained
by
vigilant
and
learned
wise
alas
the
poor
trows
their
time
of
frolic
and
liberty
was
ended
and
on
night
they
retired
to
their
gloomy
abodes
beneath
the
sod
seldom
finding
opportunity
to
reappear
again
and
never
with
the
same
licence
until
the
yules
returned
all
that
pantomime
all
that
invoking
of
holier
powers
were
but
methods
of
speeding
the
parting
guest
and
mortals
were
rejoicing
that
the
unbidden
unwelcome
must
depart
when
day
dawned
after
night
the
trows
had
vanished
and
the
yules
were
of
late
years
has
been
celebrated
in
lerwick
with
pompous
and
elaborate
masquerades
the
chief
event
of
the
evening
is
a
procession
of
maskers
or
guizers
as
they
are
called
who
escort
the
model
of
a
norse
galley
through
the
streets
and
finally
set
it
on
fire
by
throwing
their
torches
into
it
but
in
this
form
the
celebration
seems
to
date
only
from
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
former
times
an
old
boat
filled
with
tar
and
ignited
was
dragged
about
and
blazing
were
drawn
or
kicked
through
the
streets
the
fire
however
procured
was
probably
in
origin
intended
to
chase
away
the
lingering
trows
from
the
town
at
the
end
of
the
holidays
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
custom
of
annually
banishing
witches
and
demons
on
a
day
or
night
set
apart
for
the
purpose
has
not
been
confined
to
central
europe
but
can
be
traced
from
calabria
and
rome
in
the
south
to
the
shetland
islands
in
the
far
north
chapter
iv
public
scapegoats
the
expulsion
of
embodied
evils
thus
far
we
have
dealt
with
that
class
of
the
general
expulsion
of
evils
which
i
have
called
direct
or
immediate
in
this
class
the
evils
are
invisible
at
least
to
common
eyes
and
the
mode
of
deliverance
consists
for
the
most
part
in
beating
the
empty
air
and
raising
such
a
hubbub
as
may
scare
the
mischievous
spirits
and
put
them
to
flight
it
remains
to
illustrate
the
second
class
of
expulsions
in
which
the
evil
influences
are
embodied
in
a
visible
form
or
are
at
least
supposed
to
be
loaded
upon
a
material
medium
which
acts
as
a
vehicle
to
draw
them
off
from
the
people
village
or
town
the
pomos
of
california
celebrate
an
expulsion
of
devils
every
seven
years
at
which
the
devils
are
represented
by
disguised
men
twenty
or
thirty
men
array
themselves
in
harlequin
rig
and
barbaric
paint
and
put
vessels
of
pitch
on
their
heads
then
they
secretly
go
out
into
the
surrounding
mountains
these
are
to
personify
the
devils
a
herald
goes
up
to
the
top
of
the
and
makes
a
speech
to
the
multitude
at
a
signal
agreed
upon
in
the
evening
the
masqueraders
come
in
from
the
mountains
with
the
vessels
of
pitch
flaming
on
their
heads
and
with
all
the
frightful
accessories
of
noise
motion
and
costume
which
the
savage
mind
can
devise
in
representation
of
demons
the
terrified
women
and
children
flee
for
life
the
men
huddle
them
inside
a
circle
and
on
the
principle
of
fighting
the
devil
with
fire
they
swing
blazing
firebrands
in
the
air
yell
whoop
and
make
frantic
dashes
at
the
marauding
and
bloodthirsty
devils
so
creating
a
terrific
spectacle
and
striking
great
fear
into
the
hearts
of
the
assembled
hundreds
of
women
who
are
screaming
and
fainting
and
clinging
to
their
valorous
protectors
finally
the
devils
succeed
in
getting
into
the
and
the
bravest
of
the
men
enter
and
hold
a
parley
with
them
as
a
conclusion
of
the
whole
farce
the
men
summon
courage
the
devils
are
expelled
from
the
and
with
a
prodigious
row
and
racket
of
sham
fighting
are
chased
away
into
the
in
spring
as
soon
as
the
were
full
grown
on
the
banks
of
the
river
the
mandan
indians
celebrated
their
great
annual
festival
one
of
the
features
of
which
was
the
expulsion
of
the
devil
a
man
painted
black
to
represent
the
devil
entered
the
village
from
the
prairie
chased
and
frightened
the
women
and
acted
the
part
of
a
buffalo
bull
in
the
buffalo
dance
the
object
of
which
was
to
ensure
a
plentiful
supply
of
buffaloes
during
the
ensuing
year
finally
he
was
chased
from
the
village
the
women
pursuing
him
with
hisses
and
gibes
beating
him
with
sticks
and
pelting
him
with
dirt
the
mayas
of
yucatan
divided
the
year
into
eighteen
months
of
twenty
days
each
and
they
added
five
supplementary
days
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
order
to
make
a
total
of
three
hundred
and
days
these
five
supplementary
days
were
deemed
unlucky
in
the
course
of
them
the
people
banished
the
evils
that
might
threaten
them
in
the
year
on
which
they
were
about
to
enter
for
that
purpose
they
made
a
clay
image
of
the
demon
of
evil
uuayayab
that
is
he
by
whom
the
year
is
poisoned
confronted
it
with
the
deity
who
had
supreme
power
over
the
coming
year
and
then
carried
it
out
of
the
village
in
the
direction
of
that
cardinal
point
to
which
on
the
system
of
the
mayan
calendar
the
particular
year
was
supposed
to
belong
having
thus
rid
themselves
of
the
demon
they
looked
forward
to
a
happy
new
year
some
of
the
native
tribes
of
central
queensland
believe
in
a
noxious
being
called
molonga
who
prowls
unseen
and
would
kill
men
and
violate
women
if
certain
ceremonies
were
not
performed
these
ceremonies
last
for
five
nights
and
consist
of
dances
in
which
only
men
fantastically
painted
and
adorned
take
part
on
the
fifth
night
molonga
himself
personified
by
a
man
tricked
out
with
red
ochre
and
feathers
and
carrying
a
long
spear
rushes
forth
from
the
darkness
at
the
spectators
and
makes
as
if
he
would
run
them
through
great
is
the
excitement
loud
are
the
shrieks
and
shouts
but
after
another
feigned
attack
the
demon
vanishes
in
the
gloom
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
the
palace
of
the
kings
of
cambodia
is
purged
of
devils
men
painted
as
fiends
are
chased
by
elephants
about
the
palace
courts
when
they
have
been
expelled
a
consecrated
thread
of
cotton
is
stretched
round
the
palace
to
keep
them
out
in
munzerabad
a
district
of
mysore
in
southern
india
when
cholera
or
smallpox
has
broken
out
in
a
parish
the
inhabitants
assemble
and
conjure
the
demon
of
the
disease
into
a
wooden
image
which
they
carry
generally
at
midnight
into
the
next
parish
the
inhabitants
of
that
parish
in
like
manner
pass
the
image
on
to
their
neighbours
and
thus
the
demon
is
expelled
from
one
village
after
another
until
he
comes
to
the
bank
of
a
river
into
which
he
is
finally
thrown
russian
villagers
seek
to
protect
themselves
against
epidemics
whether
of
man
or
beast
by
drawing
a
furrow
with
a
plough
right
round
the
village
the
plough
is
dragged
by
four
widows
and
the
ceremony
is
performed
at
night
all
fires
and
lights
must
be
extinguished
while
the
plough
is
going
the
round
the
people
think
that
no
unclean
spirit
can
pass
the
furrow
which
has
thus
been
traced
in
the
village
of
dubrowitschi
a
puppet
is
carried
before
the
plough
with
the
cry
out
of
the
village
with
the
unclean
spirit
and
at
the
end
of
the
ceremony
it
is
torn
in
pieces
and
the
fragments
scattered
about
no
doubt
the
demon
of
the
disease
is
supposed
to
be
in
the
puppet
and
to
be
destroyed
with
it
sometimes
in
an
esthonian
village
a
rumour
will
get
about
that
the
evil
one
himself
has
been
seen
in
the
place
instantly
the
whole
village
is
in
an
uproar
and
the
entire
population
armed
with
sticks
flails
and
scythes
turns
out
to
give
him
chase
they
generally
expel
him
in
the
shape
of
a
wolf
or
a
cat
occasionally
they
brag
that
they
have
beaten
the
devil
to
death
at
carmona
in
andalusia
on
one
day
of
the
year
boys
are
stripped
naked
and
smeared
with
glue
in
which
feathers
are
stuck
thus
disguised
they
run
from
house
to
house
the
people
trying
to
avoid
them
and
to
bar
their
houses
against
them
the
ceremony
is
probably
a
relic
of
an
annual
expulsion
of
devils
some
of
the
khasis
of
assam
annually
expel
the
demon
of
plague
the
ceremony
is
called
that
is
driving
away
the
plague
with
sticks
it
takes
place
in
the
month
june
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
expulsion
the
men
rise
early
and
beat
the
roof
with
sticks
calling
upon
the
demon
of
the
plague
to
leave
the
house
later
in
the
day
they
go
down
to
the
stream
where
the
goddess
aitan
dwells
then
long
poles
or
bamboos
newly
cut
are
laid
across
the
stream
and
the
people
jump
on
them
trying
to
break
them
when
they
succeed
they
give
a
great
shout
next
a
very
large
pole
or
bamboo
is
similarly
laid
across
the
stream
and
the
people
divide
themselves
into
two
parties
one
on
each
side
of
the
stream
and
pull
against
each
other
at
opposite
ends
of
the
pole
according
to
one
account
the
party
which
succeeds
in
dragging
the
pole
to
their
side
of
the
stream
is
supposed
to
gain
health
and
prosperity
during
the
coming
year
according
to
another
account
if
the
people
on
the
east
bank
win
in
the
contest
or
good
luck
and
prosperity
are
assured
but
if
the
people
on
the
west
bank
are
victorious
then
everything
will
go
wrong
on
this
occasion
the
people
disguise
themselves
as
giants
and
wild
beasts
and
they
parade
images
of
serpents
elephants
tigers
peacocks
and
so
on
the
men
dance
with
enthusiasm
and
the
girls
dressed
in
their
best
look
on
before
the
assembly
breaks
up
the
men
play
a
sort
of
game
of
hockey
with
wooden
balls
in
this
ceremonial
contest
or
tug
of
war
between
two
parties
of
the
people
we
may
conjecture
that
the
one
party
represents
the
expelled
demons
of
the
plague
and
if
that
is
so
we
may
perhaps
assume
that
in
the
struggle
the
representatives
of
the
demons
generally
allow
themselves
to
be
overcome
by
their
adversaries
in
order
that
the
village
may
be
free
from
pestilence
in
the
coming
year
similarly
in
autumn
the
central
esquimaux
divide
themselves
into
two
parties
representing
summer
and
winter
respectively
which
pull
at
opposite
ends
of
a
rope
and
they
draw
omens
of
the
weather
to
be
expected
in
the
coming
winter
according
as
the
party
of
summer
or
of
winter
prevails
in
the
struggle
that
in
such
contests
resembling
our
english
game
of
french
and
english
or
the
tug
of
war
the
one
side
may
represent
demons
is
proved
by
a
custom
observed
by
the
chukmas
a
tribe
of
the
chittagong
hill
tracts
in
india
on
the
death
of
a
dewan
or
of
a
priest
a
curious
sport
is
customary
at
the
funeral
the
corpse
is
conveyed
to
the
place
of
cremation
on
a
car
to
this
car
ropes
are
attached
and
the
persons
attending
the
ceremony
are
divided
into
two
equal
bodies
and
set
to
work
to
pull
in
opposite
directions
one
side
represents
the
good
spirits
the
other
the
powers
of
evil
the
contest
is
so
arranged
that
the
former
are
victorious
sometimes
however
the
young
men
representing
the
demons
are
inclined
to
pull
too
vigorously
but
a
stick
generally
quells
this
unseemly
ardour
in
the
cause
of
the
contest
is
like
that
between
the
angels
and
devils
depicted
in
the
frescoes
of
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
in
burma
a
similar
struggle
takes
place
at
the
funeral
of
a
buddhist
monk
who
passed
for
a
saint
in
the
popular
estimation
ropes
are
attached
to
opposite
ends
of
the
car
on
which
the
coffin
is
placed
all
the
men
of
the
neighbourhood
hold
on
to
one
or
other
of
the
two
ends
and
pull
as
if
for
dear
life
against
each
other
even
the
women
and
girls
sometimes
join
in
the
tug
of
war
and
policemen
have
been
seen
in
a
state
of
frantic
excitement
waving
their
batons
to
encourage
the
combatants
and
dragging
back
shirkers
by
main
force
into
the
fighting
line
the
struggle
is
sometimes
prolonged
for
hours
or
even
days
with
the
example
of
the
chukmas
before
us
we
may
conjecture
that
the
original
motive
of
this
internecine
strife
was
a
persuasion
that
the
eternal
happiness
or
misery
of
the
departed
saint
depended
on
the
issue
of
this
contest
between
the
powers
of
good
and
evil
for
the
possession
of
his
mortal
remains
but
in
burma
the
tug
of
war
has
been
employed
for
more
secular
purposes
than
the
salvation
or
perdition
of
souls
the
inhabitants
we
are
told
still
have
a
custom
of
pulling
a
rope
to
produce
rain
a
rain
party
and
a
drought
party
tug
against
each
other
the
rain
party
being
allowed
the
victory
which
in
the
popular
notion
is
generally
followed
by
the
mode
in
which
this
salutary
result
follows
from
tugging
at
a
rope
is
explained
by
the
burmese
doctrine
of
or
spirits
who
cause
rain
but
it
is
only
when
these
spirits
sport
in
the
air
that
rain
falls
when
they
shut
themselves
up
in
their
houses
there
is
drought
now
in
some
burmese
writings
it
is
said
that
when
the
sun
is
in
the
path
of
the
goat
these
do
not
chuse
to
leave
their
houses
on
account
of
the
great
heat
whence
there
is
then
no
rain
for
this
reason
the
inhabitants
of
the
burma
empire
in
times
of
drought
are
wont
to
assemble
in
great
numbers
with
drums
and
a
long
cable
dividing
themselves
into
two
parties
with
a
vast
shouting
and
noise
they
drag
the
cable
contrary
ways
the
one
party
endeavouring
to
get
the
better
of
the
other
and
they
think
by
this
means
to
invite
the
to
come
out
from
their
houses
and
to
sport
in
the
air
the
thunder
and
lightning
which
frequently
precede
rain
are
the
clashing
and
shining
of
the
arms
of
these
who
sometimes
sport
in
mock
apparently
therefore
in
the
tug
of
war
practised
as
a
the
one
party
represent
the
spirits
who
have
to
be
dragged
reluctantly
from
their
houses
in
order
to
make
rain
in
the
sky
similarly
in
the
islands
when
the
people
want
a
rainy
wind
from
the
west
the
population
of
the
village
men
women
and
children
divide
into
two
parties
and
pull
against
each
other
at
the
end
of
a
long
bamboo
but
the
party
at
the
eastern
end
must
pull
the
harder
in
order
to
draw
the
desired
wind
out
of
the
west
we
can
now
perhaps
understand
why
among
the
khasis
the
victory
of
the
eastern
side
in
the
tug
of
war
is
thought
to
prognosticate
good
luck
and
prosperity
and
why
the
victory
of
the
western
side
is
believed
to
portend
the
contrary
the
distinction
is
at
once
intelligible
when
we
remember
that
in
the
country
of
the
khasis
the
rainy
wind
is
the
monsoon
which
blows
from
the
whereas
the
wind
which
blows
from
the
is
hot
and
dry
thus
a
victory
of
the
eastern
party
in
the
tug
of
war
means
that
they
have
drawn
rain
and
consequently
fertility
into
the
country
from
the
west
whereas
a
victory
of
the
western
party
signifies
that
they
have
dragged
drought
and
consequently
dearth
into
the
country
from
the
east
however
a
somewhat
different
turn
is
given
to
the
ceremony
of
in
the
east
indies
by
another
writer
who
informs
us
that
while
the
contest
only
takes
place
in
some
of
these
islands
when
rain
is
wanted
it
is
closely
connected
with
those
licentious
rites
performed
for
the
fertilization
of
the
ground
which
have
been
described
in
another
part
of
this
work
according
to
this
account
the
men
and
women
appear
to
take
opposite
sides
in
the
tug
of
war
and
in
pulling
against
each
other
they
imitate
by
their
movements
the
union
of
the
sexes
if
that
is
so
it
would
seem
that
the
rite
is
a
magical
ceremony
designed
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
ground
by
means
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
the
same
may
perhaps
be
the
intention
of
the
tug
of
war
as
it
is
practised
for
the
benefit
of
the
crops
by
some
of
the
naga
tribes
of
assam
and
this
is
the
more
likely
because
in
the
case
of
these
tribes
we
are
definitely
told
that
the
sexes
take
opposite
sides
the
women
and
girls
tugging
against
the
men
and
boys
this
is
done
by
the
tangkhuls
of
assam
a
month
after
the
rice
has
been
sown
the
ceremony
is
performed
in
order
to
take
the
omens
for
the
future
of
the
crops
and
it
is
followed
by
considerable
the
tug
of
war
between
the
sexes
with
its
attendant
license
is
repeated
before
the
are
cut
by
the
sacred
headman
in
corea
about
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
first
month
villages
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
contest
with
each
other
and
it
is
thought
that
the
village
which
wins
will
have
a
good
harvest
the
rope
which
they
pull
is
made
of
straw
two
feet
in
diameter
with
its
ends
divided
into
branches
the
men
lay
hold
of
the
main
stem
while
the
women
grasp
the
branches
and
they
often
tug
harder
than
the
men
for
they
load
their
skirts
with
stones
which
adds
weight
to
the
force
of
their
muscles
in
kamtchatka
when
the
fishing
season
is
over
the
people
used
to
divide
into
two
parties
one
of
which
tried
to
pull
a
by
a
strap
through
the
into
their
subterranean
winter
dwelling
while
the
other
party
outside
pulling
at
the
end
of
the
tree
endeavoured
to
hinder
them
if
the
party
in
the
house
succeeded
they
raised
shouts
of
joy
and
set
up
a
grass
effigy
of
a
wolf
which
they
preserved
carefully
throughout
the
year
believing
that
it
espoused
their
young
women
and
prevented
them
from
giving
birth
to
twins
for
they
deem
the
birth
of
twins
a
dreadful
misfortune
and
a
horrible
sin
they
put
it
down
to
the
wolf
in
the
forest
and
all
who
chance
to
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
shew
a
clean
pair
of
heels
leaving
the
mother
and
her
infants
to
shift
for
themselves
should
the
twins
be
both
girls
the
calamity
is
even
greater
in
the
village
of
doreh
in
dutch
new
guinea
when
some
of
the
inhabitants
have
gone
on
a
long
journey
the
people
who
stay
at
home
engage
in
a
tug
of
war
among
themselves
to
determine
whether
the
journey
will
be
prosperous
or
not
one
side
represents
the
voyagers
and
the
other
side
those
who
are
left
behind
they
pull
at
opposite
ends
of
a
long
bamboo
and
if
the
bamboo
breaks
or
the
side
which
represents
the
people
at
home
is
obliged
to
let
go
the
omen
is
favourable
in
morocco
also
the
tug
of
war
is
resorted
to
as
a
means
of
influencing
the
weather
sometimes
in
order
to
procure
rain
and
sometimes
to
procure
sunshine
and
here
men
and
women
appear
usually
to
take
opposite
sides
in
the
contest
for
example
among
the
igliwa
a
berber
people
of
the
great
atlas
when
rain
is
wanted
they
take
a
rope
and
the
men
pull
at
one
end
and
women
at
the
other
while
they
are
tugging
away
a
man
suddenly
cuts
the
rope
and
the
women
fall
down
the
same
device
for
procuring
rain
in
time
of
drought
is
practised
by
the
ait
warain
another
berber
tribe
of
morocco
but
among
them
in
the
heat
of
the
contest
the
women
as
well
as
the
men
will
sometimes
let
go
the
rope
and
allow
the
opposite
party
to
fall
on
their
backs
however
the
tsûl
another
berber
tribe
of
morocco
employ
the
tug
of
war
for
the
opposite
purpose
of
ensuring
a
supply
of
sunshine
and
heat
in
autumn
when
they
wish
to
dry
their
figs
and
grapes
the
contest
takes
place
at
night
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
apparent
contradiction
of
employing
the
same
procedure
for
opposite
purposes
vanishes
if
we
suppose
that
as
the
assamese
custom
seems
to
indicate
the
intention
is
to
draw
either
a
rainy
or
a
dry
wind
out
of
the
quarters
from
which
the
breezes
that
bring
rain
or
sunshine
usually
blow
and
which
will
usually
be
on
opposite
sides
of
the
sky
hence
in
order
fully
to
understand
the
tug
of
war
when
it
is
practised
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
weather
we
should
know
first
the
directions
from
which
the
rainy
and
the
dry
winds
respectively
come
in
the
country
under
consideration
and
second
the
direction
in
which
the
rope
is
stretched
between
the
contending
parties
if
for
example
as
happens
in
assam
the
rainy
wind
blows
from
the
west
and
a
victory
of
the
eastern
party
in
the
tug
of
war
is
an
omen
of
prosperity
we
may
conclude
with
a
fair
degree
of
probability
that
the
intention
of
the
contest
is
to
draw
the
rain
from
the
quarter
of
the
sky
in
which
it
is
lingering
but
these
niceties
of
observation
have
usually
escaped
the
attention
of
those
who
have
described
the
tug
of
war
in
various
parts
of
morocco
games
of
ball
are
played
for
the
sake
now
of
procuring
rain
and
now
of
procuring
dry
weather
the
ball
is
sometimes
propelled
with
sticks
and
sometimes
with
the
feet
of
the
competitors
an
arab
questioned
as
to
why
a
game
of
ball
should
bring
on
rain
explained
that
the
ball
is
dark
like
a
perhaps
the
answer
furnishes
the
clue
to
the
meaning
of
the
rite
if
in
such
games
played
to
influence
the
weather
the
ball
represents
a
the
success
or
failure
of
the
charm
will
depend
on
which
side
contrives
to
get
the
ball
home
in
the
enemy
s
quarters
for
example
if
rain
is
desired
and
the
rainy
wind
blows
in
morocco
as
may
perhaps
be
assumed
from
the
west
then
should
the
western
side
succeed
in
driving
the
ball
through
the
eastern
goal
there
will
be
rain
but
if
the
eastern
party
wins
then
the
rain
is
driven
away
and
the
drought
will
continue
thus
a
game
of
ball
would
in
theory
and
practice
answer
exactly
to
the
tug
of
war
practised
for
the
same
purposes
in
morocco
however
the
tug
of
war
is
apparently
used
also
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
prosperity
in
general
without
any
special
reference
to
the
weather
westermarck
was
informed
by
an
old
arab
from
the
hiaina
that
the
tug
of
war
is
no
longer
practised
at
the
great
feast
as
it
was
in
his
childhood
but
that
it
is
performed
in
the
autumn
when
the
threshing
is
going
on
and
the
fruits
are
ripe
then
men
and
women
have
a
tug
of
war
by
moonlight
so
that
the
or
evil
shall
go
away
that
the
year
shall
be
good
and
that
the
people
shall
live
in
peace
some
man
secretly
cuts
two
of
the
three
cords
of
which
the
rope
is
made
with
the
result
that
both
parties
tumble
in
this
contest
one
party
perhaps
represents
the
powers
of
good
and
the
other
the
powers
of
evil
in
general
but
why
in
these
moroccan
cases
of
the
tug
of
war
the
rope
should
be
so
often
cut
and
one
or
both
sides
laid
on
their
backs
is
not
manifest
perhaps
the
simple
device
of
suddenly
slacking
the
rope
in
order
to
make
the
opposite
side
lose
their
footing
and
so
to
haul
the
rope
away
from
them
before
they
can
recover
themselves
may
have
led
to
the
more
trenchant
measure
of
cutting
it
with
a
knife
for
the
same
purpose
these
examples
make
it
probable
that
wherever
the
tug
of
war
is
played
only
at
certain
definite
seasons
or
on
certain
particular
occasions
it
was
originally
performed
not
as
a
mere
pastime
but
as
a
magical
ceremony
designed
to
work
some
good
for
the
community
further
we
may
surmise
that
in
many
cases
the
two
contending
parties
represent
respectively
the
powers
of
good
and
evil
struggling
against
each
other
for
the
mastery
and
as
the
community
has
always
an
interest
in
the
prevalence
of
the
powers
of
good
it
may
well
happen
that
the
powers
of
evil
do
not
always
get
fair
play
in
these
conflicts
though
no
doubt
when
it
comes
to
be
pull
devil
pull
baker
the
devil
is
apt
in
the
spirit
of
a
true
sportsman
to
tug
with
as
hearty
good
will
as
his
far
more
deserving
adversary
the
baker
to
take
cases
in
which
the
game
is
played
without
any
alleged
practical
motive
the
roocooyen
indians
of
french
guiana
engage
in
the
tug
of
war
as
a
sort
of
interlude
during
the
ceremonial
tortures
of
the
youth
among
the
cingalese
the
game
is
connected
with
the
superstitious
worship
of
the
goddess
patiné
and
is
more
intended
for
a
propitiation
to
that
deity
than
considered
as
an
indulgence
or
pursued
as
an
exercise
two
opposite
parties
procure
two
sticks
of
the
strongest
and
toughest
wood
and
so
crooked
as
to
hook
into
one
another
without
slipping
they
then
attach
strong
cords
or
of
sufficient
length
to
allow
of
every
one
laying
hold
of
them
the
contending
parties
then
pull
until
one
of
the
sticks
gives
the
victorious
piece
of

gaily
decorated
placed
in
a
palanquin
and
borne
through
the
village
amid
noisy
rejoicings
often
accompanied
with
coarse
and
obscene
expressions
the
use
of
foul
language
on
this
occasion
suggests
that
the
ceremony
is
here
as
elsewhere
observed
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
fertility
in
the
provinces
of
india
the
game
is
played
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
light
half
of
the
month

the
rope
is
made
of
the
grass
called

is
thicker
than
a

arm
the
various
quarters
of
a
village
pull
against
each
other
and
the
one
which
is
victorious
keeps
possession
of
the
rope
during
the
ensuing
year
it
is
chiefly
in
the
east
of
these
provinces
that
the
game
is
played
in
the
west
it
is
unknown
sometimes
the
contest
is
between
the
inhabitants
of
neighbouring
villages
and
the
rope
is
stretched
across
the
boundary
plenty
is
supposed
to
attend
the
victorious
side
at
the
great
feast
a
yearly
sacrificial
festival
of
the
mohammedan
world
some
tribes
in
morocco
practise
a
tug
of
war
thus
among
the
ait
sadden
it
is
observed
on
the
first
day
of
the
festival
before
the
sacrifice
among
the
ait
yusi
it
is
performed
either
before
the
religious
service
or
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
and
also
in
the
morning
of
the
little
feast
both
sexes
generally
take
part
in
the
contest
the
men
tugging
at
one
end
of
the
rope
and
the
women
at
the
other
and
sometimes
the
weaker
party
applies
for
help
to
persons
of
the
same
sex
in
a
neighbouring
village
when
they
are
all
hard
at
it
the
men
may
suddenly
let
go
the
rope
and
so
send
the
women
sprawling
on
their
backs
at
ludlow
in
shropshire
a
grand
tug
of
war
used
to
take
place
on
shrove
tuesday
between
the
inhabitants
of
broad
street
ward
on
the
one
side
and
of
corve
street
ward
on
the
other
the
rope
was
three
inches
thick
and
yards
long
with
a
red
knob
at
one
end
and
a
blue
knob
at
the
other
the
rope
was
paid
out
by
the
mayor
in
person
from
a
window
in
the
market
hall
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
shops
then
put
up
their
shutters
and
the
population
engaged
in
the
struggle
with
enthusiasm
gentle
and
simple
lawyers
and
parsons
bearing
a
hand
on
one
side
or
the
other
till
their
clothes
were
torn
to
tatters
on
their
backs
the
injured
were
carried
into
the
neighbouring
houses
where
their
hurts
were
attended
to
if
the
party
of
the
red
knob
won
they
carried
the
rope
in
triumph
to
the
river
leme
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
finally
the
rope
was
sold
the
money
which
it
brought
in
was
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
beer
and
drinking
squabbling
and
fighting
ended
the
happy
day
this
ancient
and
highly
popular
pastime
was
suppressed
in
on
the
frivolous
pretext
that
it
gave
rise
to
disorderly
scenes
and
dangerous
accidents
a
similar
custom
has
long
been
observed
on
shrove
tuesday
at
presteign
in
radnorshire
the
rope
is
pulled
by
two
parties
representing
the
upper
and
the
lower
portions
of
the
town
who
strive
to
drag
it
either
to
a
point
in

to
another
point

where
the

is
reached

most
desperate
struggles
used
to
take
place
between
neighbouring
parishes
on
shrove
tuesday
for
the
possession
of
a
large
leathern
ball
stuffed
with
bran
and
called
a
the
ball
was
launched
on
the
village
green
and
contended
for
by
representatives
of
different
parishes
who
sometimes
numbered
seven
or
eight
hundred
while
five
or
six
thousand
people
might
assemble
to
witness
the
combat
for
indeed
it
was
a
fight
rather
than
a
game
the
conflict
was
maintained
with
the
utmost
fury
old
scores
were
paid
off
between
personal
enemies
there
were
always
many
wounded
and
sometimes
there
were
deaths
the
aim
of
each
side
was
to
drive
the
ball
over
a
stream
and
to
lodge
it
in
a
house
of
their
own
parish
it
was
thought
that
the
parish
which
was
victorious
in
the
struggle
would
have
a
better
crop
of
apples
that
year
than
its
neighbours
at
the
ball
was
provided
by
the
bride
who
had
been
last
married
and
she
had
the
honour
of
throwing
it
into
the
arena
the
scene
of
the
fiercest
battles
was
pierre
d
entremont
on
the
highroad
between
condé
and
tinchebray
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
the
custom
was
suppressed
at
that
village
in
with
the
help
of
four
or
five
brigades
of
police
it
is
now
everywhere
extinct
the
belief
that
the
parish
which
succeeded
in
carrying
the
ball
home
would
have
a
better
crop
of
apples
that
year
raises
a
presumption
that
these
conflicts
were
originally
practised
as
magical
rites
to
ensure
fertility
the
local
custom
of
which
required
that
the
ball
should
be
provided
and
thrown
by
the
last
bride
points
in
the
same
direction
it
is
possible
that
the
popular
english
or
rather
scotch
game
of
football
had
a
similar
origin
the
winning
side
may
have
imagined
that
they
secured
good
crops
good
weather
or
other
substantial
advantages
to
their
village
or
ward
in
like
manner
wherever
a
sham
or
a
real
conflict
takes
place
between
two
parties
annually
above
all
at
the
new
year
we
may
suspect
that
the
old
intention
was
to
ensure
prosperity
in
some
form
for
the
people
throughout
the
following
year
whether
by
obtaining
possession
of
a
material
object
in
which
the
luck
of
the
year
was
supposed
to
be
embodied
or
by
defeating
and
driving
away
a
band
of
men
who
personated
the
powers
of
evil
for
example
among
the
tenggerese
of
eastern
java
the
new
year
festival
regularly
includes
a
sham
fight
fought
between
two
bands
of
men
who
are
armed
with
spears
and
swords
and
advance
against
each
other
again
and
again
at
a
dancing
step
thrusting
at
their
adversaries
with
their
spears
but
always
taking
care
to
miss
their
aim
again
in
ferghana
a
province
of
turkestan
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
for
the
king
and
chiefs
to
divide
into
two
parties
each
of
which
chose
a
champion
then
the
two
champions
clad
in
armour
engaged
in
a
combat
with
each
other
while
the
crowd
joined
in
with
bricks
and
stones
when
one
of
them
was
slain
the
scrimmage
stopped
and
omens
were
drawn
as
to
whether
the
year
on
which
they
had
entered
would
be
prosperous
or
the
reverse
in
these
combats
it
seems
probable
that
one
side
represents
the
demons
or
other
powers
of
evil
whom
the
people
hope
to
vanquish
and
expel
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
oftener
however
the
expelled
demons
are
not
represented
at
all
but
are
understood
to
be
present
invisibly
in
the
material
and
visible
vehicle
which
conveys
them
away
here
again
it
will
be
convenient
to
distinguish
between
occasional
and
periodical
expulsions
we
begin
with
the
former
the
occasional
expulsion
of
evils
in
a
material
vehicle
the
vehicle
which
conveys
away
the
demons
may
be
of
various
kinds
a
common
one
is
a
little
ship
or
boat
thus
in
the
southern
district
of
the
island
of
ceram
when
a
whole
village
suffers
from
sickness
a
small
ship
is
made
and
filled
with
rice
tobacco
eggs
and
so
forth
which
have
been
contributed
by
all
the
people
a
little
sail
is
hoisted
on
the
ship
when
all
is
ready
a
man
calls
out
in
a
very
loud
voice
o
all
ye
sicknesses
ye
smallpoxes
agues
measles
who
have
visited
us
so
long
and
wasted
us
so
sorely
but
who
now
cease
to
plague
us
we
have
made
ready
this
ship
for
you
and
we
have
furnished
you
with
provender
sufficient
for
the
voyage
ye
shall
have
no
lack
of
food
nor
of
nor
of
areca
nuts
nor
of
tobacco
depart
and
sail
away
from
us
directly
never
come
near
us
again
but
go
to
a
land
which
is
far
from
here
let
all
the
tides
and
winds
waft
you
speedily
thither
and
so
convey
you
thither
that
for
the
time
to
come
we
may
live
sound
and
well
and
that
we
may
never
see
the
sun
rise
on
you
then
ten
or
twelve
men
carry
the
vessel
to
the
shore
and
let
it
drift
away
with
the
feeling
convinced
that
they
are
free
from
sickness
for
ever
or
at
least
till
the
next
time
if
sickness
attacks
them
again
they
are
sure
it
is
not
the
same
sickness
but
a
different
one
which
in
due
time
they
dismiss
in
the
same
manner
when
the
bark
is
lost
to
sight
the
bearers
return
to
the
village
whereupon
a
man
cries
out
the
sicknesses
are
now
gone
vanished
expelled
and
sailed
at
this
all
the
people
come
running
out
of
their
houses
passing
the
word
from
one
to
the
other
with
great
joy
beating
on
gongs
and
on
tinkling
instruments
similar
ceremonies
are
commonly
resorted
to
in
other
east
indian
islands
thus
in
to
mislead
the
demons
who
are
causing
sickness
a
small
proa
containing
the
image
of
a
man
and
provisioned
for
a
long
voyage
is
allowed
to
drift
away
with
wind
and
tide
as
it
is
being
launched
the
people
cry
o
sickness
go
from
here
turn
back
what
do
you
here
in
this
poor
land
three
days
after
this
ceremony
a
pig
is
killed
and
part
of
the
flesh
is
offered
to
dudilaa
who
lives
in
the
sun
one
of
the
oldest
men
says
old
sir
i
beseech
you
make
well
the
grandchildren
children
women
and
men
that
we
may
be
able
to
eat
pork
and
rice
and
to
drink
i
will
keep
my
promise
eat
your
share
and
make
all
the
people
in
the
village
if
the
proa
is
stranded
at
any
inhabited
spot
the
sickness
will
break
out
there
hence
a
stranded
proa
excites
much
alarm
amongst
the
coast
population
and
they
immediately
burn
it
because
demons
fly
from
fire
in
the
island
of
buru
the
proa
which
carries
away
the
demons
of
disease
is
about
twenty
feet
long
rigged
out
with
sails
oars
anchor
and
so
on
and
well
stocked
with
provisions
for
a
day
and
a
night
the
people
beat
gongs
and
drums
and
rush
about
to
frighten
the
demons
next
morning
ten
stalwart
young
men
strike
the
people
with
branches
which
have
been
previously
dipped
in
an
earthen
pot
of
water
as
soon
as
they
have
done
so
they
run
down
to
the
beach
put
the
branches
on
board
the
proa
launch
another
boat
in
great
haste
and
tow
the
bark
far
out
to
sea
there
they
cast
it
off
and
one
of
them
calls
out
grandfather
smallpox
go
willingly
visit
another
land
we
have
made
you
food
ready
for
the
voyage
we
have
now
nothing
more
to
when
they
have
landed
all
the
people
bathe
together
in
the
sea
in
this
ceremony
the
reason
for
striking
the
people
with
the
branches
is
clearly
to
rid
them
of
the
which
are
then
supposed
to
be
transferred
to
the
branches
hence
the
haste
with
which
the
branches
are
deposited
in
the
proa
and
towed
away
to
sea
so
in
the
inland
districts
of
ceram
when
smallpox
or
other
sickness
is
raging
the
priest
strikes
all
the
houses
with
consecrated
branches
which
are
then
thrown
into
the
river
to
be
carried
down
to
the
sea
exactly
as
amongst
the
wotyaks
of
russia
the
sticks
which
have
been
used
for
expelling
the
devils
from
the
village
are
thrown
into
the
river
that
the
current
may
sweep
the
baleful
burden
away
in
amboyna
for
a
similar
purpose
the
whole
body
of
the
patient
is
rubbed
with
a
live
white
cock
which
is
then
placed
on
a
little
proa
and
committed
to
the
waves
and
in
the
babar
archipelago
the
bark
which
is
to
carry
away
to
sea
the
sickness
of
a
whole
village
contains
a
bowl
of
ashes
taken
from
every
kitchen
in
the
village
and
another
bowl
into
which
all
the
sick
people
have
spat
the
plan
of
putting
puppets
in
the
boat
to
represent
sick
persons
in
order
to
lure
the
demons
after
them
is
not
uncommon
for
example
most
of
the
pagan
tribes
on
the
coast
of
borneo
seek
to
drive
away
epidemic
disease
as
follows
they
carve
one
or
more
rough
human
images
from
the
pith
of
the
sago
palm
and
place
them
on
a
small
raft
or
boat
or
malay
ship
together
with
rice
and
other
food
the
boat
is
decked
with
blossoms
of
the
areca
palm
and
with
ribbons
made
from
its
leaves
and
thus
adorned
the
little
craft
is
allowed
to
float
out
to
sea
with
the
bearing
as
the
people
fondly
think
or
hope
the
sickness
away
with
it
in
selangor
one
of
the
native
states
in
the
malay
peninsula
the
ship
employed
in
the
export
of
disease
is
or
used
to
be
a
model
of
a
special
kind
of
malay
craft
called
a
this
was
a
vessel
with
galleries
fore
and
aft
armed
with
cannon
and
used
by
malay
rajahs
on
the
coast
of
sumatra
so
gallant
a
ship
would
be
highly
acceptable
to
the
spirits
and
to
make
it
still
more
beautiful
in
their
eyes
it
was
not
uncommonly
stained
yellow
with
turmeric
or
saffron
for
among
the
malays
yellow
is
the
royal
colour
some
years
ago
a
very
fine
model
of
a
with
its
cargo
of
sickness
was
towed
down
the
river
to
sea
by
the
government

gape
in

about
the
the
practice
of
sending
away
diseases
in
boats
is
known
outside
the
limits
of
the
malay
region
thus
when
smallpox
raged
among
the
yabim
of
german
new
guinea
they
used
to
make
a
little
model
of
a
canoe
with
mast
sail
and
rudder
then
they
said
to
the
small
vessel
on
which
the
spirit
of
smallpox
was
supposed
to
have
taken
his
passage
bear
him
away
to
another
village
when
the
people
come
forth
to
draw
you
ashore
give
them
the
thing
and
do
to
them
what
you
have
done
to
lest
the
spirit
should
be
hungry
on
the
voyage
they
put
some
taro
on
board
and
to
make
sure
of
getting
rid
of
the
disease
they
wiped
their
hands
on
the
tiny
canoe
after
which
they
let
it
drift
away
it
often
happened
that
the
wind
or
tide
drove
the
vessel
back
to
the
place
from
which
it
started
then
there
would
be
a
deafening
of
drums
and
blowing
of
and
the
little
ship
or
rather
its
invisible
passenger
would
be
again
apostrophized
do
go
away
you
have
already
raged
among
us
so
that
the
air
is
poisoned
with
the
stench
of
if
this
time
it
sailed
away
they
would
stand
on
the
shore
and
watch
it
with
glad
hearts
disappearing
then
they
would
climb
the
trees
to
get
a
last
glimpse
of
it
till
it
vanished
in
the
distance
after
that
they
came
down
joyfully
and
said
to
each
other
we
have
had
enough
of
it
the
sickness
has
happily
gone
when
the
tagbanuas
and
other
tribes
of
the
philippines
suffered
from
epidemics
they
used
to
make
little
models
of
ships
supply
them
with
rice
and
fresh
drinking
water
and
launch
them
on
the
sea
in
order
that
the
evil
spirits
might
sail
away
in
them
when
the
people
of
tikopia
a
small
island
in
the
pacific
to
the
north
of
the
new
hebrides
were
attacked
by
an
epidemic
cough
they
made
a
little
canoe
and
adorned
it
with
flowers
four
sons
of
the
principal
chiefs
carried
it
on
their
shoulders
all
round
the
island
accompanied
by
the
whole
population
some
of
whom
beat
the
bushes
while
others
uttered
loud
cries
on
returning
to
the
spot
from
which
they
had
set
out
they
launched
the
canoe
on
the
sea
in
the
nicobar
islands
in
the
bay
of
bengal
when
there
is
much
sickness
in
a
village
or
no
fish
are
caught
the
blame
is
laid
upon
the
spirits
they
must
be
propitiated
with
offerings
all
relations
and
friends
are
invited
a
huge
pig
is
roasted
and
the
best
of
it
is
eaten
but
some
parts
are
offered
to
the
shades
the
heap
of
offerings
remains
in
front
of
the
house
till
it
is
carried
away
by
the
rising
tide
then
the
priests
their
faces
reddened
with
paint
and
swine
s
blood
pretend
to
catch
the
demon
of
disease
and
after
a
tussle
force
him
into
a
model
boat
made
of
leaves
and
decked
with
garlands
which
is
then
towed
so
far
to
sea
that
neither
wind
nor
tide
is
likely
to
drive
it
back
to
the
shore
in
annam
when
the
population
of
a
village
has
been
decimated
by
cholera
they
make
a
raft
and
lade
it
with
offerings
of
money
and
food
such
as
a
sucking
pig
bananas
and
oranges
sticks
of
incense
also
smoke
on
the
floating
altar
and
when
all
is
ready
and
earnest
prayers
have
been
uttered
the
raft
is
abandoned
to
the
current
of
the
river
the
people
hope
that
the
demon
of
cholera
allured
and
gratified
by
these
offerings
will
float
away
on
the
raft
and
trouble
them
no
more
often
the
vehicle
which
carries
away
the
collected
demons
or
ills
of
a
whole
community
is
an
animal
or
scapegoat
in
the
central
provinces
of
india
when
cholera
breaks
out
in
a
village
every
one
retires
after
sunset
to
his
house
the
priests
then
parade
the
streets
taking
from
the
roof
of
each
house
a
straw
which
is
burnt
with
an
offering
of
rice
ghee
and
turmeric
at
some
shrine
to
the
east
of
the
village
chickens
daubed
with
vermilion
are
driven
away
in
the
direction
of
the
smoke
and
are
believed
to
carry
the
disease
with
them
if
they
fail
goats
are
tried
and
last
of
all
pigs
when
cholera
rages
among
the
bhars
malians
and
kurmis
of
india
they
take
a
goat
or
a
either
case
the
animal
must
be
a
female
and
as
black
as
having
tied
some
grain
cloves
and
red
lead
in
a
yellow
cloth
on
its
back
they
turn
it
out
of
the
village
the
animal
is
conducted
beyond
the
boundary
and
not
allowed
to
return
sometimes
the
buffalo
is
marked
with
a
red
pigment
and
driven
to
the
next
village
where
he
carries
the
plague
with
him
the
people
of
the
city
and
cantonments
of
sagar
being
afflicted
with
a
violent
influenza
general
sir
william
sleeman
received
a
request
from
the
old
queen
dowager
of
sagar
to
allow
of
a
noisy
religious
procession
for
the
purpose
of
imploring
deliverance
from
this
great
calamity
men
women
and
children
in
this
procession
were
to
do
their
utmost
to
add
to
the
noise
by
raising
their
voices
in
psalmody
beating
upon
their
brass
pots
and
pans
with
all
their
might
and
discharging
firearms
where
they
could
get
them
and
before
the
noisy
crowd
was
to
be
driven
a
buffalo
which
had
been
purchased
by
general
subscription
in
order
that
every
family
might
participate
in
the
merit
they
were
to
follow
it
out
for
eight
miles
where
it
was
to
be
turned
loose
for
any
man
who
would
take
it
if
the
animal
returned
the
disease
it
was
said
must
return
with
it
and
the
ceremony
be
performed
over
again
it
was
however
subsequently
determined
that
the
animal
should
be
a
goat
and
he
was
driven
before
the
crowd
accordingly
i
have
on
several
occasions
been
requested
to
allow
of
such
noisy
in
cases
of
once
when
influenza
was
raging
in
pithoria
a
village
to
the
of
sagar
a
man
had
a
small
carriage
made
after
a
plan
of
his
own
for
a
pair
of
scapegoats
which
were
harnessed
to
it
and
driven
to
a
wood
at
some
distance
where
they
were
let
loose
from
that
hour
the
disease
entirely
ceased
in
the
town
the
goats
never
returned
had
they
done
so
it
was
affirmed
that
the
disease
must
have
come
back
with
them
the
use
of
a
scapegoat
is
not
uncommon
in
the
hills
of
the
eastern
ghats
in
during
a
severe
outbreak
of
smallpox
the
people
of
jepur
did
reverence
to
a
goat
marched
it
to
the
ghats
and
let
it
loose
on
the
plains
in
southern
konkan
on
the
appearance
of
cholera
the
villagers
went
in
procession
from
the
temple
to
the
extreme
boundaries
of
the
village
carrying
a
basket
of
cooked
rice
covered
with
red
powder
a
wooden
doll
representing
the
pestilence
and
a
cock
the
head
of
the
cock
was
cut
off
at
the
village
boundary
and
the
body
was
thrown
away
when
cholera
had
thus
been
transferred
from
one
village
to
another
the
second
village
observed
the
same
ceremony
and
passed
on
the
scourge
to
its
neighbours
and
so
on
through
a
number
of
villages
among
the
korwas
of
mirzapur
when
cholera
has
broken
out
the
priest
offers
a
black
cock
or
if
the
disease
is
very
malignant
a
black
goat
at
the
shrine
of
the
local
deity
and
then
drives
the
animal
away
in
the
direction
of
some
other
village
but
it
has
not
gone
far
before
he
overtakes
it
kills
it
and
eats
it
which
he
may
do
with
perfect
safety
in
virtue
of
his
sacred
office
again
when
cholera
is
raging
among
the
pataris
an
aboriginal
dravidian
race
of
south
mirzapur
the
wizard
and
the
village
elders
feed
a
black
cock
with
grain
and
drive
it
beyond
the
boundaries
ordering
the
fowl
to
take
the
disease
away
with
it
a
little
oil
red
lead
and
a
spangle
worn
by
a
woman
on
her
forehead
are
usually
fastened
to
the
bird
s
head
before
it
is
let
loose
the
cost
of
purchasing
the
cock
is
defrayed
by
public
subscription
when
such
a
bird
of
appears
in
a
village
the
priest
takes
it
to
the
shrine
of
the
local
deity
and
sacrifices
it
there
but
sometimes
he
merely
bows
before
it
at
the
shrine
and
passes
it
on
to
some
other
village
if
a

this

with
women

may
be
a
relic
of
some
grosser
form
of
expiation
in
which
a
human
being
was
sacrificed
or
banished
charms
of
this
sort
in
india
no
doubt
date
from
a
remote
antiquity
an
ancient
indian
book
of
magic
known
as
the
describes
a
ceremony
of
letting
loose
against
a
hostile
army
a
ewe
in
which
the
power
of
disease
was
believed
to
be
incarnate
in
the
same
treatise
we
read
of
a
mode
of
getting
rid
of
by
fastening
a
hook
to
the
left
leg
of
a
crow
attaching
a
sacrificial
cake
to
the
hook
and
then
letting
the
bird
fly
away
in
a
direction
while
the
priest
or
magician
recites
as
usual
the
appropriate
formula
amongst
the
dinkas
a
pastoral
people
of
the
white
nile
each
family
possesses
a
sacred
cow
when
the
country
is
threatened
with
war
famine
or
any
other
public
calamity
the
chiefs
of
the
village
require
a
particular
family
to
surrender
their
sacred
cow
to
serve
as
a
scapegoat
the
animal
is
driven
by
the
women
to
the
brink
of
the
river
and
across
it
to
the
other
bank
there
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
and
fall
a
prey
to
ravening
beasts
then
the
women
return
in
silence
and
without
looking
behind
them
were
they
to
cast
a
backward
glance
they
imagine
that
the
ceremony
would
have
no
effect
when
influenza
broke
out
in
a
virulent
form
among
the
negroes
of
togoland
during
the
winter
of
the
natives
set
the
trouble
down
to
the
machinations
of
evil
spirits
who
must
be
expelled
the
country
the
principal
instrument
of
expulsion
was
a
fat
toad
which
was
dragged
through
the
streets
of
every
town
or
village
followed
by
an
elder
who
sprinkled
holy
water
to
right
and
left
all
the
evil
was
thus
concentrated
in
the
toad
which
was
finally
thrown
away
into
the
forest
thus
the
natives
expected
to
rid
the
village
of
the
influenza
in
when
the
aymara
indians
of
bolivia
and
peru
were
suffering
from
a
plague
they
loaded
a
black
llama
with
the
clothes
of
the
people
sprinkled
brandy
on
the
clothes
and
then
turned
the
animal
loose
on
the
mountains
hoping
that
it
would
carry
the
pest
away
with
it
in
some
parts
of
india
a
principal
means
of
expelling
an
epidemic
is
a
little
toy
chariot
called
a
or
in
which
the
goddess
of
the
disease
is
supposed
to
be
carted
away
it
is
carried
or
drawn
in
procession
to
the
next
village
the
inhabitants
of
which
pass
it
on
in
like
manner
with
great
alacrity
to
their
neighbours
thus
the
goddess
and
the
plague
are
transferred
from
village
to
village
until
at
last
they
come
to
one
which
is
so
far
away
from
its
next
neighbour
that
the
people
do
not
care
to
undertake
the
long
weary
journey
in
that
case
they
content
themselves
with
conveying
the
chariot
to
a
place
so
shut
in
by
hills
that
the
disease
can
not
possibly
escape
and
there
they
leave
it
to
die
or
if
the
village
is
near
the
sea
they
drown
the
sickness
by
throwing
the
chariot
into
the
water
however
in
central
india
the
real
home
of
the
goddess
of
cholera
is
at
unkareshwar
and
accordingly
the
chariot
in
which
she
is
politely
escorted
out
of
a
village
is
finally
deposited
at
or
near
that
place
it
is
usual
and
proper
for
the
people
of
a
village
to
give
a
friendly
notice
to
their
neighbours
that
they
are
going
to
cart
the
cholera
smallpox
or
whatever
it
may
be
to
their
village
so
that
the
inhabitants
may
be
ready
to
receive
the
goddess
with
due
honour
and
to
escort
her
on
her
progress
but
some
unneighbourly
folk
without
giving
notice
go
by
night
and
stealthily
deposit
the
chariot
on
the
outskirts
of
the
next
village
if
the
inhabitants
are
not
on
the
watch
and
suffer
the
fatal
little
vehicle
to
remain
there
the
disease
will
naturally
cleave
to
them
sometimes
perhaps
generally
the
procession
with
the
chariot
is
accompanied
by
a
goat
a
cock
and
a
pot
of
native
beer
or
wine
which
serve
as
additional
attractions
to
the
goddess
to
set
out
on
her
travels
occasionally
the
scapegoat
is
a
man
for
example
from
time
to
time
the
gods
used
to
warn
the
king
of
uganda
that
his
foes
the
banyoro
were
working
magic
against
him
and
his
people
to
make
them
die
of
disease
to
avert
such
a
catastrophe
the
king
would
send
a
scapegoat
to
the
frontier
of
bunyoro
the
land
of
the
enemy
the
scapegoat
consisted
of
either
a
man
and
a
boy
or
a
woman
and
her
child
chosen
because
of
some
mark
or
bodily
defect
which
the
gods
had
noted
and
by
which
the
victims
were
to
be
recognized
with
the
human
victims
were
sent
a
cow
a
goat
a
fowl
and
a
dog
and
a
strong
guard
escorted
them
to
the
land
which
the
god
had
indicated
there
the
limbs
of
the
victims
were
broken
and
they
were
left
to
die
a
lingering
death
in
the
enemy
s
country
being
too
crippled
to
crawl
back
to
uganda
the
disease
or
plague
was
thought
to
have
been
thus
transferred
to
the
victims
and
to
have
been
conveyed
back
in
their
persons
to
the
land
from
which
it
came
so
too
after
a
war
the
gods
sometimes
advised
the
king
to
send
back
a
scapegoat
in
order
to
free
the
warriors
from
some
evil
that
had
attached
itself
to
the
army
one
of
the
women
slaves
a
cow
a
goat
a
fowl
and
a
dog
would
be
chosen
from
among
the
captives
and
sent
back
to
the
borders
of
the
country
whence
they
had
come
there
they
were
maimed
and
left
to
die
after
that
the
army
would
be
pronounced
clean
and
allowed
to
return
to
the
capital
in
each
case
a
bundle
of
herbs
would
be
rubbed
over
the
people
and
the
cattle
and
would
then
be
tied
to
the
victims
who
would
thus
carry
back
the
evil
with
them
a
similar
use
of
scapegoats
human
and
animal
was
regularly
made
after
a
king
of
uganda
had
been
crowned
two
men
were
brought
to
the
king
one
of
them
he
wounded
slightly
with
an
arrow
shot
from
a
bow
the
man
was
then
sent
away
under
a
strong
guard
as
a
scapegoat
to
bunyoro
the
enemy
s
country
and
with
him
were
sent
a
cow
a
goat
and
a
dog
on
his
sad
journey
he
took
with
him
the
dust
and
ashes
of
the
sacred
fire
which
had
burned
day
and
night
at
the
entrance
to
the
late
king
s
enclosure
and
had
been
extinguished
as
usual
at
his
death
arrived
at
their
destination
the
man
and
the
animals
were
maimed
and
left
to
die
they
were
believed
to
bear
away
with
them
any
uncleanness
that
might
cleave
to
the
new
king
or
queen
some
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
china
as
a
protection
against
pestilence
select
a
man
of
great
muscular
strength
to
act
the
part
of
scapegoat
having
besmeared
his
face
with
paint
he
performs
many
antics
with
the
view
of
enticing
all
pestilential
and
noxious
influences
to
attach
themselves
to
him
only
he
is
assisted
by
a
priest
finally
the
scapegoat
hotly
pursued
by
men
and
women
beating
gongs
and
is
driven
with
great
haste
out
of
the
town
or
village
in
the
punjaub
a
cure
for
the
murrain
is
to
hire
a
man
of
the
chamar
caste
turn
his
face
away
from
the
village
brand
him
with
a
sickle
and
let
him
go
out
into
the
jungle
taking
the
murrain
with
him
he
must
not
look
back
when
disease
breaks
out
among
a
herd
the
oraons
take
the
herdsman
himself
tie
a
wooden
bell
from
one
of
the
cows
round
his
neck
beat
him
with
sticks
and
drive
him
out
of
the
village
to
a
where
the
bell
and
sticks
are
deposited
in
the
territory
of
kumaon
lying
on
the
southern
slopes
of
the
western
himalayas
the
custom
of
employing
a
human
scapegoat
appears
to
have
taken
a
somewhat
peculiar
form
in
the
ceremony
known
as
barat
first
of
all
a
thick
rope
of
grass
is
stretched
from
the
top
of
a
cliff
to
the
valley
beneath
where
it
is
made
fast
to
posts
driven
into
the
ground
next
a
wooden
saddle
with
a
very
sharp
ridge
and
unpadded
is
attached
by
thongs
to
the
cable
along
which
it
runs
in
a
deep
groove
a
man
now
seats
himself
on
the
saddle
and
is
strapped
to
it
while
or
heavy
stones
are
suspended
from
his
feet
to
secure
his
balance
then
after
various
ceremonies
have
been
performed
and
a
kid
sacrificed
he
throws
himself
as
far
back
in
the
saddle
as
he
can
go
and
is
started
off
to
slide
down
the
rope
into
the
valley
away
he
shoots
at
an
speed
the
saddle
under
him
however
well
greased
emits
volumes
of
smoke
during
the
greater
part
of
his
progress
and
he
is
nearly
senseless
when
he
reaches
the
bottom
here
men
are
waiting
to
catch
him
and
run
forward
with
him
some
distance
in
order
to
break
gradually
the
force
of
his
descent
this
ceremony
regarded
as
a
propitiation
of
mahadeva
is
performed
as
a
means
of
delivering
a
community
from
present
or
impending
calamity
thus
for
example
it
was
performed
when
cholera
was
raging
at
almora
and
the
people
traced
the
immunity
they
enjoyed
to
the
due
observance
of
the
rite
each
district
has
its
hereditary
badi
as
the
performer
is
called
he
is
supported
by
annual
contributions
in
grain
from
the
inhabitants
as
well
as
by
special
payments
for
each
performance
when
the
ceremony
is
over
the
grass
rope
is
cut
up
and
distributed
among
the
villagers
who
hang
the
pieces
as
charms
at
the
eaves
of
their
houses
and
they
preserve
the
hair
of
the
badi
for
a
similar
purpose
yet
while
his
severed
locks
bring
fertility
to
other
people
s
lands
he
entails
sterility
on
his
own
and
it
is
firmly
believed
that
no
seed
sown
by
his
hand
could
ever
sprout
formerly
the
rule
prevailed
that
if
a
badi
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
from
the
rope
in
the
course
of
his
flying
descent
he
was
immediately
despatched
with
a
sword
by
the
spectators
the
rule
has
naturally
been
abolished
by
the
english
government
but
its
former
observance
seems
to
indicate
that
the
custom
of
letting
a
man
slide
down
a
rope
as
a
charm
to
avert
calamity
is
only
a
mitigation
of
an
older
custom
of
putting
him
to
death
a
somewhat
similar
ceremony
is
annually
performed
at
lhasa
a
few
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
tibetan
new
year
which
falls
in
spring
the
scene
of
the
performance
is
potala
hill
on
the
summit
and
slope
of
which
is
built
the
superb
castle
of
the
grand
lama
of
tibet
a
massive
and
imposing
pile
of
buildings
which
attracts
the
eye
and
dominates
the
landscape
from
afar
on
the
day
in
question
a
rope
of
hide
is
stretched
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
steep
hill
and
men
from
a
distant
province
of
tibet
climb
up
it
with
the
agility
of
monkeys
they
are
called
flying
spirits
arrived
at
the
top
each
of
them
places
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
breast
stretches
out
his
hands
and
feet
and
letting
himself
go
shoots
down
the
rope
in
the
words
of
a
chinese
writer
like
the
bolt
flying
from
the
bow
or
the
swallow
skimming
the
water
tis
a
wondrous
sight
considering
that
these
performers
are
called
spirits
and
that
the
performance
takes
place
a
few
days
after
the
new
year
a
season
so
commonly
selected
for
the
expulsion
of
demons
we
may
conjecture
that
the
flying
spirits
represent
the
powers
of
evil
who
are
thus
shot
out
of
the
tibetan
pope
s
palace
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
periodic
expulsion
of
evils
in
a
material
vehicle
in
this
last
case
the
expulsion
of
evils
if
i
am
right
in
so
interpreting
the
ceremony
is
periodic
not
occasional
being
repeated
every
spring
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
it
brings
us
accordingly
to
the
consideration
of
a
whole
class
of
such
cases
for
the
mediate
expulsion
of
evils
by
means
of
a
scapegoat
or
other
material
vehicle
like
the
immediate
expulsion
of
them
in
invisible
form
tends
to
become
periodic
and
for
a
like
reason
thus
in
perak
a
state
on
the
west
coast
of
the
malay
peninsula
it
was
in
ancient
times
the
custom
to
perform
periodically
a
ceremony
intended
to
ensure
the
prosperity
of
the
country
by
the
propitiation
of
friendly
spirits
and
the
expulsion
of
evil
influences
the
writer
who
records
the
custom
is
uncertain
as
to
the
period
which
elapsed
between
two
successive
celebrations
he
suggests
with
hesitation
that
the
rite
was
performed
once
in
seven
years
or
once
in
a
rajah
s
reign
the
name
of
the
ceremony
was
which
means
the
cleansing
of
the
country
from
when
the
time
came
the
rajah
the
chiefs
and
a
great
following
of
people
assembled
at
a
point
as
far
up
the
river
as
possible
but
short
of
the
rapids
which
further
up
impede
navigation
there
a
number
of
rafts
were
prepared
some
of
them
elaborately
built
with
houses
on
them
four
of
them
were
devoted
to
the
four
great
classes
of
spirits
which
are
found
in
perak
namely
the
or
the
the
and
the
in
each
of
these
rafts
a
number
of
wizards
took
up
their
post
according
to
the
particular
class
of
demon
which
they
affected
the
procession
was
headed
by
the
raft
devoted
to
the
and
in
it
was
set
up
a
tree
with
all
its
branches
kept
erect
by
stays
it
was
followed
by
the
three
rafts
dedicated
to
the
other
three
classes
of
spirits
and
behind
them
came
a
train
of
other
rafts
bearing
mere
common
mortals
the
royal
bandsmen
the
rajah
himself
the
chiefs
and
the
people
as
the
long
procession
floated
down
the
river
with
the
current
the
wizards
standing
on
sheets
of
tin
waved
white
cloths
and
shouted
invocations
to
the
spirits
and
demons
who
inhabited
the
country
through
which
the
rafts
were
drifting
seaward
the
burden
of
the
invocations
was
to
invite
the
spirits
and
demons
to
come
aboard
the
rafts
and
partake
of
the
food
which
had
been
considerately
made
ready
for
them
at
every
village
on
the
bank
large
enough
to
possess
a
mosque
for
the
malays
of
perak
are
professing
mohammedans
the
procession
halted
a
buffalo
subscribed
for
by
the
inhabitants
was
slaughtered
and
its
head
placed
on
one
of
the
while
people
feasted
on
the
flesh
the
ceremony
ended
at
bras
basah
a
village
on
the
left
bank
of
the
perak
river
not
far
from
its
mouth
there
the
rafts
were
abandoned
to
the
current
which
swept
them
out
to
sea
doubtless
bearing
with
them
the
hapless
demons
who
had
been
lured
by
the
tempting
viands
to
embark
and
were
now
left
to
toss
forlorn
on
the
great
deep
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
and
the
winds
again
every
year
generally
in
march
the
people
of
leti
moa
and
lakor
islands
of
the
indian
archipelago
send
away
all
their
diseases
to
sea
they
make
a
proa
about
six
feet
long
rig
it
with
sails
oars
rudder
and
other
gear
and
every
family
deposits
in
it
some
rice
fruit
a
fowl
two
eggs
insects
that
ravage
the
fields
and
so
on
then
they
let
it
drift
away
to
sea
saying
take
away
from
here
all
kinds
of
sickness
take
them
to
other
islands
to
other
lands
distribute
them
in
places
that
lie
eastward
where
the
sun
the
biajas
of
borneo
annually
send
to
sea
a
little
bark
laden
with
the
sins
and
misfortunes
of
the
people
the
crew
of
any
ship
that
falls
in
with
the
bark
at
sea
will
suffer
all
the
sorrows
with
which
it
is
laden
a
like
custom
is
annually
observed
by
the
dusuns
of
the
tuaran
district
in
british
north
borneo
the
ceremony
is
the
most
important
of
the
whole
year
its
aim
is
to
bring
good
luck
to
the
village
during
the
ensuing
year
by
solemnly
expelling
all
the
evil
spirits
that
may
have
collected
in
or
about
the
houses
throughout
the
last
twelve
months
the
task
of
routing
out
the
demons
and
banishing
them
devolves
chiefly
on
women
who
indeed
play
the
principal
part
in
all
religious
ceremonies
among
the
dusuns
while
the
humble
duty
of
beating
drums
and
banging
gongs
is
discharged
by
members
of
the
inferior
sex
on
this
momentous
occasion
a
procession
of
women
in
full
ceremonial
dress
goes
from
house
to
house
stopping
at
each
to
go
through
their
performances
at
the
head
of
the
procession
marches
a
boy
carrying
a
spear
on
which
is
impaled
a
bundle
of
palm
leaves
containing
rice
he
is
followed
by
two
men
who
carry
a
large
gong
and
a
drum
slung
on
a
pole
between
them
then
come
the
women
one
of
them
carries
a
small
sucking
pig
in
a
basket
on
her
back
and
all
of
them
bear
wands
with
which
they
belabour
the
little
pig
at
the
appropriate
moment
its
squeals
help
to
attract
the
vagrant
spirits
at
every
house
the
women
dance
and
sing
clashing
castanets
or
cymbals
of
brass
and
jingling
bunches
of
little
brass
bells
in
both
hands
when
the
performance
has
been
repeated
at
every
house
in
the
village
the
procession
defiles
down
to
the
river
and
all
the
evil
spirits
which
the
performers
have
chased
from
the
houses
follow
them
to
the
edge
of
the
water
there
a
raft
has
been
made
ready
and
moored
to
the
bank
it
contains
offerings
of
food
cloth
and
swords
and
the
deck
is
crowded
with
figures
of
men
women
animals
and
birds
all
made
out
of
the
leaves
of
the
sago
palm
the
evil
spirits
now
embark
on
the
raft
and
when
they
are
all
aboard
it
is
pushed
off
and
allowed
to
float
down
with
the
current
carrying
the
demons
with
it
should
the
raft
run
aground
near
the
village
it
is
shoved
off
with
all
speed
lest
the
invisible
passengers
should
seize
the
opportunity
of
landing
and
returning
to
the
village
finally
the
sufferings
of
the
little
pig
whose
squeals
served
to
decoy
the
demons
from
their
are
terminated
by
death
for
it
is
killed
and
its
carcase
thrown
away
every
year
at
the
beginning
of
the
dry
season
the
nicobar
islanders
carry
the
model
of
a
ship
through
their
villages
the
devils
are
chased
out
of
the
huts
and
driven
on
board
the
little
ship
which
is
then
launched
and
suffered
to
sail
away
with
the
wind
the
ceremony
has
been
described
by
a
catechist
who
witnessed
it
at
car
nicobar
in
july
for
three
days
the
people
were
busy
preparing
two
very
large
floating
cars
shaped
like
canoes
fitted
with
sails
and
loaded
with
certain
leaves
which
possessed
the
valuable
property
of
expelling
devils
while
the
young
people
were
thus
engaged
the
exorcists
and
the
elders
sat
in
a
house
singing
songs
by
turns
but
often
they
would
come
forth
pace
the
beach
armed
with
rods
and
forbid
the
devil
to
enter
the
village
the
fourth
day
of
the
solemnity
bore
the
name
of
which
means
expelling
the
devil
by
in
the
evening
all
the
villagers
assembled
the
women
bringing
baskets
of
ashes
and
bunches
of
leaves
these
leaves
were
then
distributed
to
everybody
old
and
young
when
all
was
ready
a
band
of
robust
men
attended
by
a
guard
of
exorcists
carried
one
of
the
cars
down
to
the
sea
on
the
right
side
of
the
village
graveyard
and
set
it
floating
in
the
water
as
soon
as
they
had
returned
another
band
of
men
carried
the
other
car
to
the
beach
and
floated
it
similarly
in
the
sea
to
the
left
of
the
graveyard
the
barks
being
now
launched
the
women
threw
ashes
from
the
shore
and
the
whole
crowd
shouted
saying
fly
away
devil
fly
away
never
come
again
the
wind
and
the
tide
being
favourable
the
canoes
sailed
quickly
away
and
that
night
all
the
people
feasted
together
with
great
joy
because
the
devil
had
departed
in
the
direction
of
chowra
a
similar
expulsion
of
devils
takes
place
once
a
year
in
other
nicobar
villages
but
the
ceremonies
are
held
at
different
times
in
different
places
at
in
india
an
earthen
pot
containing
the
accumulated
sins
of
the
people
is
annually
set
adrift
on
the
river
legend
says
that
the
custom
originated
with
a
wicked
priest
who
after
atoning
for
his
guilt
by
a
course
of
austerities
and
expiatory
ceremonies
was
directed
to
sail
upon
the
river
in
a
boat
with
white
sails
if
the
white
sails
turned
black
it
would
be
a
sign
that
his
sins
were
forgiven
him
they
did
so
and
he
joyfully
allowed
the
boat
to
drift
with
his
sins
to
sea
amongst
many
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
china
a
great
festival
is
celebrated
in
the
third
month
of
every
year
it
is
held
by
way
of
a
general
rejoicing
over
what
the
people
believe
to
be
a
total
annihilation
of
the
ills
of
the
past
twelve
months
the
destruction
is
supposed
to
be
effected
in
the
following
way
a
large
earthenware
jar
filled
with
gunpowder
stones
and
bits
of
iron
is
buried
in
the
earth
a
train
of
gunpowder
communicating
with
the
jar
is
then
laid
and
a
match
being
applied
the
jar
and
its
contents
are
blown
up
the
stones
and
bits
of
iron
represent
the
ills
and
disasters
of
the
past
year
and
the
dispersion
of
them
by
the
explosion
is
believed
to
remove
the
ills
and
disasters
themselves
the
festival
is
attended
with
much
revelling
and
drunkenness
on
new
year
s
day
people
in
corea
seek
to
rid
themselves
of
all
their
distresses
by
painting
images
on
paper
writing
against
them
their
troubles
of
body
or
mind
and
afterwards
giving
the
papers
to
a
boy
to
burn
another
method
of
effecting
the
same
object
at
the
same
season
is
to
make
rude
dolls
of
straw
stuff
them
with
a
few
copper
coins
and
throw
them
into
the
street
whoever
picks
up
such
an
effigy
gets
all
the
troubles
and
thereby
relieves
the
original
sufferer

fourteenth
day
of

george
bogle
the
english
envoy
sent
to
tibet
by
warren
hastings
witnessed
the
celebration
of
the
tibetan
new
year
s
day
at
teshu
lumbo
the
capital
of
the
teshu
lama
monks
walked
in
procession
round
the
court
to
the
music
of
cymbals
tabors
trumpets
hautboys
and
drums
then
others
clad
in
masquerade
dress
and
wearing
masks
which
represented
the
heads
of
animals
mostly
wild
beasts
danced
with
antic
motions
after
this
the
figure
of
a
man
chalked
upon
paper
was
laid
upon
the
ground
many
strange
ceremonies
which
to
me
who
did
not
understand
them
appeared
whimsical
were
performed
about
it
and
a
great
fire
being
kindled
in
a
corner
of
the
court
it
was
at
length
held
over
it
and
being
formed
of
combustibles
vanished
with
much
smoke
and
explosion
i
was
told
it
was
a
figure
of
the
another
tibetan
mode
of
expelling
demons
from
a
dwelling
is
to
make
a
paste
image
into
which
the
lamas
by
their
incantations
conjure
all
the
evil
spirits
that
may
be
lurking
in
the
house
this
image
is
carried
to
a
distance
by
a
runner
and
thrown
away
he
is
attended
by
men
who
shout
at
the
top
of
their
voices
brandish
swords
and
fire
guns
all
to
frighten
the
demons
and
drive
them
far
from
human
habitations
at
old
calabar
on
the
coast
of
guinea
the
devils
and
ghosts
are
or
used
to
be
publicly
expelled
once
in
two
years
among
the
spirits
thus
driven
from
their
haunts
are
the
souls
of
all
the
people
who
died
since
the
last
lustration
of
the
town
about
three
weeks
or
a
month
before
the
expulsion
which
according
to
one
account
takes
place
in
the
month
of
november
rude
effigies
representing
men
and
animals
such
as
crocodiles
leopards
elephants
bullocks
and
birds
are
made
of
or
wood
and
being
hung
with
strips
of
cloth
and
bedizened
with
are
set
before
the
door
of
every
house
about
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
the
ceremony
the
whole
population
turns
out
into
the
streets
and
proceeds
with
a
deafening
uproar
and
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
excitement
to
drive
all
lurking
devils
and
ghosts
into
the
effigies
in
order
that
they
may
be
banished
with
them
from
the
abodes
of
men
for
this
purpose
bands
of
people
roam
through
the
streets
knocking
on
doors
firing
guns
beating
drums
blowing
on
horns
ringing
bells
clattering
pots
and
pans
shouting
and
hallooing
with
might
and
main
in
short
making
all
the
noise
it
is
possible
for
them
to
raise
the
hubbub
goes
on
till
the
approach
of
dawn
when
it
gradually
subsides
and
ceases
altogether
at
sunrise
by
this
time
the
houses
have
been
thoroughly
swept
and
all
the
frightened
spirits
are
supposed
to
have
huddled
into
the
effigies
or
their
fluttering
drapery
in
these
wicker
figures
are
also
deposited
the
sweepings
of
the
houses
and
the
ashes
of
yesterday
s
fires
then
the
images
are
hastily
snatched
up
carried
in
tumultuous
procession
down
to
the
brink
of
the
river
and
thrown
into
the
water
to
the
tuck
of
drums
the
bears
them
away
seaward
and
thus
the
town
is
swept
clean
of
ghosts
and
devils
for
another
two
years
this
biennial
expulsion
of
spirits
goes
by
the
name
of
and
the
effigies
by
which
it
is
effected
are
called
or
further
to
the
west
similar
ceremonies
are
or
were
till
recently
enacted
at
porto
novo
the
seaport
of
dahomey
one
of
them
has
been
described
by
an
a
catholic
missionary
who
interpreted
the
rites
as
a
funeral
of
death
he
says
some
time
ago
a
curious
event
took
place
the
king
had
commanded
to
celebrate
the
funeral
of
death
every
year
at
the
season
of
the
rains
the
predecessors
of
his
sable
majesty
in
order
to
preserve
the
life
of
their
dear
subjects
had
caused
the
fetish
of
that
terrible
and
pitiless
enemy
who
spares
not
even
kings
to
be
drowned
in
the
lagoon
toffa
wished
to
comply
with
the
traditions
of
his
however
the
ceremony
as
described
by
the
missionary
seems
to
conform
closely
to
the
type
of
the
expulsion
of
ghosts
and
demons
two
days
before
the
crowning
act
of
the
celebration
the
streets
were
carefully
swept
and
all
the
filth
which
usually
encumbered
them
was
removed
lest
death
should
there
find
a
all
the
people
from
the
neighbouring
villages
assembled
their
fetishes
daubed
with
red
paint
were
carried
in
great
pomp
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
attended
by
noisy
processions
of
mummers
a
great
multitude
passed
the
night
in
the
public
square
drinking
singing
and
shouting
finally
a
number
of
rude
and
hideous
effigies
were
escorted
by
a
noisy
crowd
to
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
there
canoes
were
waiting
to
receive
them
and
paddle
them
out
to
deep
water
where
they
were
flung
overboard
these
effigies
the
missionary
regarded
as
so
many
images
of
death
who
thus
received
his
passport
and
was
dismissed
from
the
territory
of
porto
novo
but
more
probably
they
represented
the
hosts
of
demons
and
ghosts
who
were
believed
to
lurk
about
the
town
and
to
massacre
people
under
the
form
of
sickness
and
disease
having
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
whole
baleful
crew
the
inhabitants
no
doubt
thought
that
they
had
removed
the
principal
if
not
the
only
cause
of
death
and
that
accordingly
they
had
taken
out
a
new
lease
of
life
it
is
not
without
interest
to
observe
that
in
cleansing
their
streets
the
people
did
actually
retrench
one
of
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
disease
and
death
especially
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
a
damp
tropical
climate
hence
the
measures
they
took
for
the
prolongation
of
their
lives
were
really
to
a
certain
extent
effectual
though
they
did
not
accomplish
their
object
in
the
precise
way
they
imagined
so
curiously
does
it
often
happen
that
the
savage
reaches
the
goal
of
his
wishes
by
a
road
which
to
civilized
man
might
appear
at
first
sight
to
lead
far
away
from
it
before
the
hos
of
togoland
to
the
west
of
dahomey
celebrate
their
festival
of
the
new
yams
which
has
been
described
in
another
part
of
this
work
they
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
clean
the
town
and
to
put
it
in
order
the
way
in
which
they
do
so
is
this
they
take
leaves
of
two
particular
sorts
of
trees
the
and
the
together
with
creepers
and
ashes
and
bind
all
the
leaves
fast
to
a
pole
of
the
tree
as
they
do
so
they
pray
or
command
the
evil
spirits
the
witches
and
all
other
evils
in
the
town
to
enter
into
the
band
and
be
bound
with
it
then
they
make
a
paste
out
of
the
ashes
mixed
with
urine
and
smear
it
on
the
bundle
of
leaves
saying
we
smear
it
on
the
face
of
the
evil
ones
who
are
in
this
bundle
in
order
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
see
any
then
they
throw
the
bundle
on
the
ground
and
mock
at
it
next
they
take
all
the
similar
poles
wrapt
in
creepers
in
which
they
have
bound
up
all
the
evil
powers
and
carry
them
out
of
the
town
and
stick
them
in
the
ground
on
the
various
roads
leading
into
the
town
when
they
have
done
this
they
say
that
they
have
driven
the
evils
out
of
the
town
and
shut
the
door
against
them
after
that
they
wash
the
faces
of
all
the
people
with
a
medicine
which
has
been
prepared
by
the
oldest
men
thereupon
they
all
return
home
to
sweep
out
their
houses
and
yards
they
sweep
even
the
ground
in
front
of
the
yards
so
that
the
whole
town
is
thoroughly
clean
all
the
and
refuse
of
which
have
been
swept
together
are
carried
out
of
the
town
and
the
people
rail
at
the
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
oldest
men
assemble
and
tie
a
toad
to
a
young
they
say
that
they
wish
now
to
sweep
the
town
and
finish
the
ceremony
so
they
drag
the
toad
behind
them
through
the
whole
town
in
the
direction
of
mount
adaklu
when
that
has
been
done
the
priests
say
that
they
will
now
remove
the
sicknesses
in
the
evening
they
give
public
notice
that
they
are
about
to
take
to
the
road
so
nobody
may
light
a
fire
on
the
hearth
or
eat
at
dead
of
night
when
people
are
asleep
three
men
go
through
the
town
one
of
them
drags
behind
them
a
toad
fastened
to
a
bunch
of
herbs
another
carries
a
calabash
of
holy
herbs
and
water
with
which
he
sprinkles
the
streets
and
the
third
whistles
softly
as
soon
as
they
have
thus
passed
through
the
whole
town
they
throw
away
the
toad
and
the
holy
herbs
in
the
direction
of
mount
adaklu
next
morning
the
women
sweep
out
their
houses
and
hearths
and
set
the
sweepings
on
broken
wooden
plates
many
put
on
torn
mats
or
torn
clothes
others
tie
grasses
and
creepers
about
them
while
they
do
so
they
pray
saying
all
ye
sicknesses
which
are
in
our
body
and
plague
us
we
are
come
this
day
to
cast
you
out
when
they
set
out
so
to
do
the
priest
commands
every
man
to
cry
out
thrice
and
thereby
to
smite
himself
on
the
mouth
in
a
moment
they
all
cry
out
smite
themselves
on
the
mouth
and
run
as
fast
as
their
legs
can
carry
them
in
the
direction
of
mount
adaklu
as
they
run
they
say
out
out
what
kills
anybody
out
ye
evil
spirits
out
and
all
that
makes
our
heads
to
ache
out
anlo
and
adaklu
are
the
places
whither
all
evil
ought
to
now
on
mount
adaklu
there
stands
a
tree
and
when
they
have
come
thither
they
throw
everything
away
and
return
home
after
their
return
every
man
washes
himself
with
the
medicine
which
is
set
forth
for
that
purpose
in
the
public
street
then
he
goes
into
his
house
such
is
the
ceremony
by
which
the
hos
prepare
themselves
to
eat
the
new
yams
thus
among
the
hos
the
public
expulsion
of
evils
is
definitely
connected
with
the
crops
and
therefore
takes
place
every
year
not
every
two
years
as
at
old
calabar
similar
annual
expulsions
of
embodied
evils
are
not
unknown
in
europe
on
the
evening
of
easter
sunday
the
gypsies
of
southern
europe
take
a
wooden
vessel
like
a
which
rests
on
two
cross
pieces
of
wood
in
this
they
place
herbs
and
simples
together
with
the
dried
carcase
of
a
snake
or
lizard
which
every
person
present
must
first
have
touched
with
his
fingers
the
vessel
is
then
wrapt
in
white
and
red
wool
carried
by
the
oldest
man
from
tent
to
tent
and
finally
thrown
into
running
water
not
however
before
every
member
of
the
band
has
spat
into
it
once
and
the
sorceress
has
uttered
some
spells
over
it
they
believe
that
by
performing
this
ceremony
they
dispel
all
the
illnesses
that
would
otherwise
have
afflicted
them
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
that
if
any
one
finds
the
vessel
and
opens
it
out
of
curiosity
he
and
his
will
be
visited
by
all
the
maladies
which
the
others
have
escaped
the
scapegoat
by
means
of
which
the
accumulated
ills
of
a
whole
year
are
publicly
expelled
is
sometimes
an
animal
for
example
among
the
garos
of
assam
besides
the
sacrifices
for
individual
cases
of
illness
there
are
certain
ceremonies
which
are
observed
once
a
year
by
a
whole
community
or
village
and
are
intended
to
safeguard
its
members
from
dangers
of
the
forest
and
from
sickness
and
mishap
during
the
coming
twelve
months
the
principal
of
these
is
the
asongtata
ceremony
close
to
the
outskirts
of
every
big
village
a
number
of
stones
may
be
noticed
stuck
into
the
ground
apparently
without
order
or
method
these
are
known
by
the
name
of
and
on
them
is
offered
the
sacrifice
which
the
asongtata
demands
the
sacrifice
of
a
goat
takes
place
and
a
month
later
that
of
a
monkey
or
a
is
considered
necessary
the
animal
chosen
has
a
rope
fastened
round
its
neck
and
is
led
by
two
men
one
on
each
side
of
it
to
every
house
in
the
village
it
is
taken
inside
each
house
in
turn
the
assembled
villagers
meanwhile
beating
the
walls
from
the
outside
to
frighten
and
drive
out
any
evil
spirits
which
may
have
taken
up
their
residence
within
the
round
of
the
village
having
been
made
in
this
manner
the
monkey
or
rat
is
led
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
killed
by
a
blow
of
a
which
disembowels
it
and
then
crucified
on
bamboos
set
up
in
the
ground
round
the
crucified
animal
long
sharp
bamboo
stakes
are
placed
which
form
de
round
about
it
these
commemorate
the
days
when
such
defences
surrounded
the
villages
on
all
sides
to
keep
off
human
enemies
and
they
are
now
a
symbol
to
ward
off
sickness
and
dangers
to
life
from
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
the
required
for
the
purpose
is
hunted
down
some
days
before
but
should
it
be
found
impossible
to
catch
one
a
brown
monkey
may
take
its
place
a
hulock
may
not
be
here
the
crucified
ape
or
rat
is
the
public
scapegoat
which
by
its
vicarious
sufferings
and
death
relieves
the
people
from
all
sickness
and
mishap
in
the
coming
year
again
on
one
day
of
the
year
the
bhotiyas
of
juhar
in
the
western
himalayas
take
a
dog
intoxicate
him
with
spirits
and
bhang
or
hemp
and
having
fed
him
with
sweetmeats
lead
him
round
the
village
and
let
him
loose
they
then
chase
and
kill
him
with
sticks
and
stones
and
believe
that
when
they
have
done
so
no
disease
or
misfortune
will
visit
the
village
during
the
year
in
some
parts
of
breadalbane
it
was
formerly
the
custom
on
new
year
s
day
to
take
a
dog
to
the
door
give
him
a
bit
of
bread
and
drive
him
out
saying
get
away
you
dog
whatever
death
of
men
or
loss
of
cattle
would
happen
in
this
house
to
the
end
of
the
present
year
may
it
all
light
on
your
head
it
appears
that
the
white
dogs
annually
sacrificed
by
the
iroquois
at
their
new
year
festival
are
or
have
been
regarded
as
scapegoats
according
to
clark
who
witnessed
the
ceremony
in
january
on
the
first
day
of
the
festival
all
the
fires
in
the
village
were
extinguished
the
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds
and
a
new
fire
kindled
with
flint
and
steel
on
a
subsequent
day
men
dressed
in
fantastic
costumes
went
round
the
village
gathering
the
sins
of
the
people
when
the
morning
of
the
last
day
of
the
festival
was
come
two
white
dogs
decorated
with
red
paint
wampum
feathers
and
ribbons
were
led
out
they
were
soon
strangled
and
hung
on
a
ladder
firing
and
yelling
succeeded
and
half
an
hour
later
the
animals
were
taken
into
a
house
where
the
people
s
sins
were
transferred
to
the
carcases
were
afterwards
burnt
on
a
pyre
of
wood
according
to
the
rev
kirkland
who
wrote
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
ashes
of
the
pyre
upon
which
one
of
the
white
dogs
was
burnt
were
carried
through
the
village
and
sprinkled
at
the
door
of
every
house
formerly
however
as
we
have
seen
the
iroquois
expulsion
of
evils
was
immediate
and
not
by
scapegoat
on
the
day
of
atonement
which
was
the
tenth
day
of
the
seventh
month
the
jewish
laid
both
his
hands
on
the
head
of
a
live
goat
confessed
over
it
all
the
iniquities
of
the
children
of
israel
and
having
thereby
transferred
the
sins
of
the
people
to
the
beast
sent
it
away
into
the
wilderness
the
scapegoat
upon
whom
the
sins
of
the
people
are
periodically
laid
may
also
be
a
human
being
at
onitsha
on
the
niger
two
human
beings
used
to
be
annually
sacrificed
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
land
the
victims
were
purchased
by
public
subscription
all
persons
who
during
the
past
year
had
fallen
into
gross
sins
such
as
incendiarism
theft
adultery
witchcraft
and
so
forth
were
expected
to
contribute
or
a
little
over
the
money
thus
collected
was
taken
into
the
interior
of
the
country
and
expended
in
the
purchase
of
two
sickly
persons
to
be
offered
as
a
sacrifice
for
all
these
abominable
for
the
land
and
one
for
the
a
man
from
a
neighbouring
town
was
hired
to
put
them
to
death
on
the
of
february
the
rev
taylor
witnessed
the
sacrifice
of
one
of
these
victims
the
sufferer
was
a
woman
about
nineteen
or
twenty
years
of
age
they
dragged
her
alive
along
the
ground
face
downwards
from
the
king
s
house
to
the
river
a
distance
of
two
miles
the
crowds
who
accompanied
her
crying
wickedness
wickedness
the
intention
was
to
take
away
the
iniquities
of
the
land
the
body
was
dragged
along
in
a
merciless
manner
as
if
the
weight
of
all
their
wickedness
was
thus
carried
similar
customs
are
said
to
be
still
secretly
practised
every
year
by
many
tribes
on
the
delta
of
the
niger
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
of
the
british
government
among
the
yoruba
negroes
of
west
africa
the
human
victim
chosen
for
sacrifice
and
who
may
be
either
a
or
a
slave
a
person
of
noble
or
wealthy
parentage
or
one
of
humble
birth
is
after
he
has
been
chosen
and
marked
out
for
the
purpose
called
an
he
is
always
well
fed
and
nourished
and
supplied
with
whatever
he
should
desire
during
the
period
of
his
confinement
when
the
occasion
arrives
for
him
to
be
sacrificed
and
offered
up
he
is
commonly
led
about
and
paraded
through
the
streets
of
the
town
or
city
of
the
sovereign
who
would
sacrifice
him
for
the
of
his
government
and
of
every
family
and
individual
under
it
in
order
that
he
might
carry
off
the
sin
guilt
misfortune
and
death
of
all
without
exception
ashes
and
chalk
would
be
employed
to
hide
his
identity
by
the
one
being
freely
thrown
over
his
head
and
his
face
painted
with
the
latter
whilst
individuals
would
often
rush
out
of
their
houses
to
lay
their
hands
upon
him
that
they
might
thus
transfer
to
him
their
sin
guilt
trouble
and
death
this
parading
done
he
is
taken
through
a
temporary
sacred
shed
of
palm
and
other
tree
branches
and
especially
of
the
former
the
igbodu
and
to
its
first
division
where
many
persons
might
follow
him
and
through
a
second
where
only
the
chiefs
and
other
very
important
persons
might
escort
and
accompany
him
to
and
to
a
third
where
only
the
babalawo
priest
and
his
official
assistant
the
ajigbona
are
permitted
to
enter
with
him
here
after
he
himself
has
given
out
or
started
his
last
song
which
is
to
be
taken
up
by
the
large
assembly
of
people
who
will
have
been
waiting
to
hear
his
last
word
or
his
last
groan
his
head
is
taken
off
and
his
blood
offered
to
the
gods
the
announcement
of
his
last
word
or
his
last
groan
heard
and
taken
up
by
the
people
would
be
a
signal
for
joy
gladness
and
thanksgiving
and
for
drum
beating
and
dancing
as
an
expression
of
their
gratification
because
their
sacrifice
has
been
accepted
the
divine
wrath
is
appeased
and
the
prospect
of
prosperity
or
increased
prosperity
in
siam
it
used
to
be
the
custom
on
one
day
of
the
year
to
single
out
a
woman
broken
down
by
debauchery
and
carry
her
on
a
litter
through
all
the
streets
to
the
music
of
drums
and
hautboys
the
mob
insulted
her
and
pelted
her
with
dirt
and
after
having
carried
her
through
the
whole
city
they
threw
her
on
a
dunghill
or
a
hedge
of
thorns
outside
the
ramparts
forbidding
her
ever
to
enter
the
walls
again
they
believed
that
the
woman
thus
drew
upon
herself
all
the
malign
influences
of
the
air
and
of
evil
spirits
in
japan
the
or
that
is
to
say
demon
expelling
is
a
sort
of
drama
in
which
disease
or
more
generally
is
personified
and
driven
away
with
threats
and
a
show
of
violence
like
the
it
was
performed
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
this
association
is
only
natural
the
demons
of
the
are
personified
wintry
influences
with
the
diseases
which
they
bring
with
them
while
the
is
intended
to
cleanse
the
people
from
sin
and
uncleanness
things
closely
related
to
disease
as
well
as
from
disease
itself
though
probably
of
chinese
origin
the
is
a
tolerably
ancient
rite
it
is
alluded
to
in
the
under
the
date
it
was
at
one
time
performed
at
court
on
an
imposing
scale
four
bands
of
twenty
youths
each
wearing
a
mask
and
each
carrying
a
halberd
in
the
left
hand
marched
simultaneously
from
the
four
gates
of
the
palace
driving
the
devils
before
them
another
account
of
this
ceremony
says
that
a
man
disguised
himself
as
the
demon
of
pestilence
in
which
garb
he
was
shot
at
and
driven
off
by
the
courtiers
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
of
reed
staves
were
used
for
the
same
purpose
there
was
formerly
a
practice
at
asakusa
in
tokio
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
for
a
man
got
up
as
a
devil
to
be
chased
round
the
pagoda
there
by
another
wearing
a
mask
after
this
tickets
were
scrambled
for
by
the
spectators
these
were
carried
away
and
pasted
up
over
the
doors
as
a
charm
against
the
battas
of
sumatra
offer
either
a
red
horse
or
a
buffalo
as
a
public
sacrifice
to
purify
the
land
and
obtain
the
favour
of
the
gods
formerly
it
is
said
a
man
was
bound
to
the
same
stake
as
the
buffalo
and
when
they
killed
the
animal
the
man
was
driven
away
no
one
might
receive
him
converse
with
him
or
give
him
food
doubtless
he
was
supposed
to
carry
away
the
sins
and
misfortunes
of
the
people
human
scapegoats
as
we
shall
see
presently
were
well
known
in
classical
antiquity
and
even
in
mediæval
europe
the
custom
seems
not
to
have
been
wholly
extinct
in
the
town
of
halberstadt
in
thüringen
there
was
a
church
said
to
have
been
founded
by
charlemagne
in
this
church
every
year
they
chose
a
man
who
was
believed
to
be
stained
with
heinous
sins
on
the
first
day
of
lent
he
was
brought
to
the
church
dressed
in
mourning
garb
with
his
head
muffled
up
at
the
close
of
the
service
he
was
turned
out
of
the
church
during
the
forty
days
of
lent
he
perambulated
the
city
barefoot
neither
entering
the
churches
nor
speaking
to
any
one
the
canons
took
it
in
turn
to
feed
him
after
midnight
he
was
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
streets
on
the
day
before
good
friday
after
the
consecration
of
the
holy
oil
he
was
readmitted
to
the
church
and
absolved
from
his
sins
the
people
gave
him
money
he
was
called
adam
and
was
now
believed
to
be
in
a
state
of
innocence
at
entlebuch
in
switzerland
down
to
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
custom
of
annually
expelling
a
scapegoat
was
preserved
in
the
ceremony
of
driving
posterli
from
the
village
into
the
lands
of
the
neighbouring
village
posterli
was
represented
by
a
lad
disguised
as
an
old
witch
or
as
a
goat
or
an
ass
amid
a
deafening
noise
of
horns
clarionets
bells
whips
and
so
forth
he
was
driven
out
sometimes
posterli
was
represented
by
a
puppet
which
was
drawn
on
a
sledge
and
left
in
a
corner
of
the
neighbouring
village
the
ceremony
took
place
on
the
thursday
evening
of
the
last
week
but
one
before
christmas
in
munich
down
to
about
a
hundred
years
ago
the
expulsion
of
the
devil
from
the
city
used
to
be
annually
enacted
on
ascension
day
on
the
eve
of
ascension
day
a
man
disguised
as
a
devil
was
chased
through
the
streets
which
were
then
narrow
and
dirty
in
contrast
to
the
broad
thoroughfares
lined
with
imposing
buildings
which
now
distinguish
the
capital
of
bavaria
his
pursuers
were
dressed
as
witches
and
wizards
and
provided
with
the
indispensable
crutches
brooms
and
pitchforks
which
make
up
the
outfit
of
these
uncanny
beings
while
the
devil
fled
before
them
the
troop
of
maskers
made
after
him
with
wild
whoops
and
halloos
and
when
they
overtook
him
they
ducked
him
in
puddles
or
rolled
him
on
dunghills
in
this
way
the
demon
at
last
succeeded
in
reaching
the
palace
where
he
put
off
his
hideous
and
now
filthy
disguise
and
was
rewarded
for
his
vicarious
sufferings
by
a
copious
meal
the
devilish
costume
which
he
had
thrown
off
was
then
stuffed
with
hay
and
straw
and
conveyed
to
a
particular
church
the
frauenkirche
where
it
was
kept
over
night
being
hung
by
a
rope
from
a
window
in
the
tower
on
the
afternoon
of
ascension
day
before
the
vesper
service
began
an
image
of
the
saviour
was
drawn
up
to
the
roof
of
the
church
no
doubt
to
symbolize
the
event
which
the
day
commemorates
then
burning
tow
and
wafers
were
thrown
on
the
people
meantime
the
effigy
of
the
devil
painted
black
with
a
pair
of
horns
and
a
lolling
red
tongue
had
been
dangling
from
the
church
tower
to
the
delight
of
a
gaping
crowd
of
spectators
gathered
before
the
church
it
was
now
flung
down
into
their
midst
and
a
fierce
struggle
for
possession
of
it
took
place
among
the
rabble
finally
it
was
carried
out
of
the
town
by
the
isar
gate
and
burned
on
a
neighbouring
height
in
order
that
the
foul
fiend
might
do
no
harm
to
the
the
custom
died
out
at
munich
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
it
is
said
that
similar
ceremonies
are
observed
to
this
day
in
some
villages
of
upper
bavaria
this
quaint
ceremony
suggests
that
the
pardoned
criminal
who
used
to
play
the
principal
part
in
a
solemn
religious
procession
on
ascension
day
at
rouen
may
in
like
manner
have
originally
served
if
not
as
a
representative
of
the
devil
at
least
as
a
public
scapegoat
who
relieved
the
whole
people
of
their
sins
and
sorrows
for
a
year
by
taking
them
upon
himself
this
would
explain
why
the
gaol
had
to
be
raked
in
order
to
furnish
one
who
would
parade
with
the
highest
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
in
their
gorgeous
vestments
through
the
streets
of
rouen
while
the
church
bells
pealed
out
the
clergy
chanted
banners
waved
and
every
circumstance
combined
to
enhance
the
pomp
and
splendour
of
the
pageant
it
would
add
a
pathetic
significance
to
the
crowning
act
of
the
ceremony
when
on
a
lofty
platform
in
the
public
square
with
the
eyes
of
a
great
and
silent
multitude
turned
upon
him
the
condemned
malefactor
received
from
the
church
the
absolution
and
remission
of
his
sins
for
if
the
rite
is
to
be
interpreted
in
the
way
here
suggested
the
sins
which
were
thus
forgiven
were
those
not
of
one
man
only
but
of
the
whole
people
no
wonder
then
that
when
the
sinner
now
a
sinner
no
more
rose
from
his
knees
and
thrice
lifted
the
silver
shrine
of
romain
in
his
arms
the
whole
vast
assembly
in
the
square
broke
out
into
joyous
cries
of
noel
noel
which
they
understood
to
signify
god
be
with
us
in
christian
countries
no
more
appropriate
season
could
be
selected
for
the
ceremony
of
the
human
scapegoat
than
ascension
day
which
commemorates
the
departure
from
earth
of
him
who
in
the
belief
of
millions
took
away
the
sins
of
the
world
sometimes
the
scapegoat
is
a
divine
animal
the
people
of
malabar
share
the
hindoo
reverence
for
the
cow
to
kill
and
eat
which
they
esteem
to
be
a
crime
as
heinous
as
homicide
or
wilful
nevertheless
the
bramans
transfer
the
sins
of
the
people
into
one
or
more
cows
which
are
then
carry
d
away
both
the
cows
and
the
sins
wherewith
these
beasts
are
charged
to
what
place
the
braman
shall
when
the
ancient
egyptians
sacrificed
a
bull
they
invoked
upon
its
head
all
the
evils
that
might
otherwise
befall
themselves
and
the
land
of
egypt
and
thereupon
they
either
sold
the
bull
s
head
to
the
greeks
or
cast
it
into
the
river
now
it
can
not
be
said
that
in
the
times
known
to
us
the
egyptians
worshipped
bulls
in
general
for
they
seem
to
have
commonly
killed
and
eaten
them
but
a
good
many
circumstances
point
to
the
conclusion
that
originally
all
cattle
bulls
as
well
as
cows
were
held
sacred
by
the
egyptians
for
not
only
were
all
cows
esteemed
holy
by
them
and
never
sacrificed
but
even
bulls
might
not
be
sacrificed
unless
they
had
certain
natural
marks
a
priest
examined
every
bull
before
it
was
sacrificed
if
it
had
the
proper
marks
he
put
his
seal
on
the
animal
in
token
that
it
might
be
sacrificed
and
if
a
man
sacrificed
a
bull
which
had
not
been
sealed
he
was
put
to
death
moreover
the
worship
of
the
black
bulls
apis
and
mnevis
especially
the
former
played
an
important
part
in
egyptian
religion
all
bulls
that
died
a
natural
death
were
carefully
buried
in
the
suburbs
of
the
cities
and
their
bones
were
afterwards
collected
from
all
parts
of
egypt
and
interred
in
a
single
spot
and
at
the
sacrifice
of
a
bull
in
the
great
rites
of
isis
all
the
worshippers
beat
their
breasts
and
mourned
on
the
whole
then
we
are
perhaps
entitled
to
infer
that
bulls
were
originally
as
cows
were
always
esteemed
sacred
by
the
egyptians
and
that
the
slain
bull
upon
whose
head
they
laid
the
misfortunes
of
the
people
was
once
a
divine
scapegoat
it
seems
not
improbable
that
the
lamb
annually
slain
by
the
madis
of
central
africa
is
a
divine
scapegoat
and
the
same
supposition
may
partly
explain
the
zuni
sacrifice
of
the
turtle
lastly
the
scapegoat
may
be
a
divine
man
thus
in
november
the
gonds
of
india
worship
ghansyam
deo
the
protector
of
the
crops
and
at
the
festival
the
god
himself
is
said
to
descend
on
the
head
of
one
of
the
worshippers
who
is
suddenly
seized
with
a
kind
of
fit
and
after
staggering
about
rushes
off
into
the
jungle
where
it
is
believed
that
if
left
to
himself
he
would
die
mad
however
they
bring
him
back
but
he
does
not
recover
his
senses
for
one
or
two
days
the
people
think
that
one
man
is
thus
singled
out
as
a
scapegoat
for
the
sins
of
the
rest
of
the
village
in
the
temple
of
the
moon
the
albanians
of
the
eastern
caucasus
kept
a
number
of
sacred
slaves
of
whom
many
were
inspired
and
prophesied
when
one
of
these
men
exhibited
more
than
usual
symptoms
of
inspiration
or
insanity
and
wandered
solitary
up
and
down
the
woods
like
the
gond
in
the
jungle
the
high
priest
had
him
bound
with
a
sacred
chain
and
maintained
him
in
luxury
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
was
anointed
with
unguents
and
led
forth
to
be
sacrificed
a
man
whose
business
it
was
to
slay
these
human
victims
and
to
whom
practice
had
given
dexterity
advanced
from
the
crowd
and
thrust
a
sacred
spear
into
the
victim
s
side
piercing
his
heart
from
the
manner
in
which
the
slain
man
fell
omens
were
drawn
as
to
the
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
then
the
body
was
carried
to
a
certain
spot
where
all
the
people
stood
upon
it
as
a
purificatory
ceremony
this
last
circumstance
clearly
indicates
that
the
sins
of
the
people
were
transferred
to
the
victim
just
as
the
jewish
priest
transferred
the
sins
of
the
people
to
the
scapegoat
by
laying
his
hands
on
the
animal
s
head
and
since
the
man
was
believed
to
be
possessed
by
the
divine
spirit
we
have
here
an
undoubted
example
of
a
slain
to
take
away
the
sins
and
misfortunes
of
the
people
in
tibet
the
ceremony
of
the
scapegoat
presents
some
remarkable
features
the
tibetan
new
year
begins
with
the
new
moon
which
appears
about
the
fifteenth
of
february
for
days
afterwards
the
government
of
lhasa
the
capital
is
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
ordinary
rulers
and
entrusted
to
the
monk
of
the
debang
monastery
who
offers
to
pay
the
highest
sum
for
the
privilege
the
successful
bidder
is
called
the
jalno
and
he
announces
his
accession
to
power
in
person
going
through
the
streets
of
lhasa
with
a
silver
stick
in
his
hand
monks
from
all
the
neighbouring
monasteries
and
temples
assemble
to
pay
him
homage
the
jalno
exercises
his
authority
in
the
most
arbitrary
manner
for
his
own
benefit
as
all
the
fines
which
he
exacts
are
his
by
purchase
the
profit
he
makes
is
about
ten
times
the
amount
of
the
purchase
money
his
men
go
about
the
streets
in
order
to
discover
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
that
can
be
found
fault
with
every
house
in
lhasa
is
taxed
at
this
time
and
the
slightest
offence
is
punished
with
unsparing
rigour
by
fines
this
severity
of
the
jalno
drives
all
working
classes
out
of
the
city
till
the
days
are
over
but
if
the
laity
go
out
the
clergy
come
in
all
the
buddhist
monasteries
of
the
country
for
miles
round
about
open
their
gates
and
disgorge
their
inmates
all
the
roads
that
lead
down
into
lhasa
from
the
neighbouring
mountains
are
full
of
monks
hurrying
to
the
capital
some
on
foot
some
on
horseback
some
riding
asses
or
lowing
oxen
all
carrying
their
and
culinary
utensils
in
such
multitudes
do
they
come
that
the
streets
and
squares
of
the
city
are
encumbered
with
their
swarms
and
incarnadined
with
their
red
cloaks
the
disorder
and
confusion
are
indescribable
bands
of
the
holy
men
traverse
the
streets
chanting
prayers
or
uttering
wild
cries
they
meet
they
jostle
they
quarrel
they
fight
bloody
noses
black
eyes
and
broken
heads
are
freely
given
and
received
all
day
long
too
from
before
the
peep
of
dawn
till
after
darkness
has
fallen
these
monks
hold
services
in
the
dim
air
of
the
great
machindranath
temple
the
cathedral
of
lhasa
and
thither
they
crowd
thrice
a
day
to
receive
their
doles
of
tea
and
soup
and
money
the
cathedral
is
a
vast
building
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
city
and
surrounded
by
bazaars
and
shops
the
idols
in
it
are
richly
inlaid
with
gold
and
precious
stones
days
after
the
jalno
has
ceased
to
have
authority
he
assumes
it
again
and
for
ten
days
acts
in
the
same
arbitrary
manner
as
before
on
the
first
of
the
ten
days
the
priests
again
assemble
at
the
cathedral
pray
to
the
gods
to
prevent
sickness
and
other
evils
among
the
people
and
as
a
sacrifice
one
man
the
man
is
not
killed
purposely
but
the
ceremony
he
undergoes
often
proves
fatal
grain
is
thrown
against
his
head
and
his
face
is
painted
half
white
half
thus
grotesquely
disguised
and
carrying
a
coat
of
skin
on
his
arm
he
is
called
the
king
of
the
years
and
sits
daily
in
the
where
he
helps
himself
to
whatever
he
likes
and
goes
about
shaking
a
black
yak
s
tail
over
the
people
who
thus
transfer
their
bad
luck
to
him
on
the
tenth
day
all
the
troops
in
lhasa
march
to
the
great
temple
and
form
in
line
before
it
the
king
of
the
years
is
brought
forth
from
the
temple
and
receives
small
donations
from
the
assembled
multitude
he
then
ridicules
the
jalno
saying
to
him
what
we
perceive
through
the
five
senses
is
no
illusion
all
you
teach
is
untrue
and
the
like
the
jalno
who
represents
the
grand
lama
for
the
time
being
contests
these
heretical
opinions
the
dispute
waxes
warm
and
at
last
both
agree
to
decide
the
questions
at
issue
by
a
cast
of
the
dice
the
jalno
offering
to
change
places
with
the
scapegoat
should
the
throw
be
against
him
if
the
king
of
the
years
wins
much
evil
is
prognosticated
but
if
the
jalno
wins
there
is
great
rejoicing
for
it
proves
that
his
adversary
has
been
accepted
by
the
gods
as
a
victim
to
bear
all
the
sins
of
the
people
of
lhasa
fortune
however
always
favours
the
jalno
who
throws
sixes
with
unvarying
success
while
his
opponent
turns
up
only
ones
nor
is
this
so
extraordinary
as
at
first
sight
it
might
appear
for
the
jalno
s
dice
are
marked
with
nothing
but
sixes
and
his
adversary
s
with
nothing
but
ones
when
he
sees
the
finger
of
providence
thus
plainly
pointed
against
him
the
king
of
the
years
is
terrified
and
flees
away
upon
a
white
horse
with
a
white
dog
a
white
bird
salt
and
so
forth
which
have
all
been
provided
for
him
by
the
government
his
face
is
still
painted
half
white
and
half
black
and
he
still
wears
his
leathern
coat
the
whole
populace
pursues
him
hooting
yelling
and
firing
blank
shots
in
volleys
after
him
thus
driven
out
of
the
city
he
is
detained
for
seven
days
in
the
great
chamber
of
horrors
at
the
samyas
monastery
surrounded
by
monstrous
and
terrific
images
of
devils
and
skins
of
huge
serpents
and
wild
beasts
thence
he
goes
away
into
the
mountains
of
chetang
where
he
has
to
remain
an
outcast
for
several
months
or
a
year
in
a
narrow
den
if
he
dies
before
the
time
is
out
the
people
say
it
is
an
auspicious
omen
but
if
he
survives
he
may
return
to
lhasa
and
play
the
part
of
scapegoat
over
again
the
following
year
this
quaint
ceremonial
still
annually
observed
in
the
secluded
capital
of
rome
of
interesting
because
it
exhibits
in
a
clearly
marked
religious
stratification
a
series
of
divine
redeemers
themselves
redeemed
of
vicarious
sacrifices
vicariously
atoned
for
of
gods
undergoing
a
process
of
fossilization
who
while
they
retain
the
privileges
have
disburdened
themselves
of
the
pains
and
penalties
of
divinity
in
the
jalno
we
may
without
undue
straining
discern
a
successor
of
those
temporary
kings
those
mortal
gods
who
purchase
a
short
lease
of
power
and
glory
at
the
price
of
their
lives
that
he
is
the
temporary
substitute
of
the
grand
lama
is
certain
that
he
is
or
was
once
liable
to
act
as
scapegoat
for
the
people
is
made
nearly
certain
by
his
offer
to
change
places
with
the
real
king
of
the
the
arbitrament
of
the
dice
should
go
against
him
it
is
true
that
the
conditions
under
which
the
question
is
now
put
to
the
hazard
have
reduced
the
offer
to
an
idle
form
but
such
forms
are
no
mere
mushroom
growths
springing
up
of
themselves
in
a
night
if
they
are
now
lifeless
formalities
empty
husks
devoid
of
significance
we
may
be
sure
that
they
once
had
a
life
and
a
meaning
if
at
the
present
day
they
are
blind
alleys
leading
nowhere
we
may
be
certain
that
in
former
days
they
were
paths
that
led
somewhere
if
only
to
death
that
death
was
the
goal
to
which
of
old
the
tibetan
scapegoat
passed
after
his
brief
period
of
licence
in
the
is
a
conjecture
that
has
much
to
commend
it
analogy
suggests
it
the
blank
shots
fired
after
him
the
statement
that
the
ceremony
often
proves
fatal
the
belief
that
his
death
is
a
happy
omen
all
confirm
it
we
need
not
wonder
then
that
the
jalno
after
paying
so
dear
to
act
as
for
a
few
weeks
should
have
preferred
to
die
by
deputy
rather
than
in
his
own
person
when
his
time
was
up
the
painful
but
necessary
duty
was
accordingly
laid
on
some
poor
devil
some
social
outcast
some
wretch
with
whom
the
world
had
gone
hard
who
readily
agreed
to
throw
away
his
life
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
if
only
he
might
have
his
fling
in
the
meantime
for
observe
that
while
the
time
allowed
to
the
original
measured
by
weeks
the
time
allowed
to
the
deputy
s
deputy
was
cut
down
to
days
ten
days
according
to
one
authority
seven
days
according
to
another
so
short
a
rope
was
doubtless
thought
a
long
enough
tether
for
so
black
or
sickly
a
sheep
so
few
sands
in
the
slipping
so
fast
away
sufficed
for
one
who
had
wasted
so
many
precious
years
hence
in
the
who
now
masquerades
with
motley
countenance
in
the
of
lhasa
sweeping
up
misfortune
with
a
black
yak
s
tail
we
may
fairly
see
the
substitute
of
a
substitute
the
vicar
of
a
vicar
the
proxy
on
whose
back
the
heavy
burden
was
laid
when
it
had
been
lifted
from
nobler
shoulders
but
the
clue
if
we
have
followed
it
aright
does
not
stop
at
the
jalno
it
leads
straight
back
to
the
pope
of
lhasa
himself
the
grand
lama
of
whom
the
jalno
is
merely
the
temporary
vicar
the
analogy
of
many
customs
in
many
lands
points
to
the
conclusion
that
if
this
human
divinity
stoops
to
resign
his
ghostly
power
for
a
time
into
the
hands
of
a
substitute
it
is
or
rather
was
once
for
no
other
reason
than
that
the
substitute
might
die
in
his
stead
thus
through
the
mist
of
ages
unillumined
by
the
lamp
of
history

chapter
on
scapegoats
in
general
the
foregoing
survey
of
the
custom
of
publicly
expelling
the
accumulated
evils
of
a
village
or
town
or
country
suggests
a
few
general
observations
in
the
first
place
it
will
not
be
disputed
that
what
i
have
called
the
immediate
and
the
mediate
expulsions
of
evil
are
identical
in
intention
in
other
words
that
whether
the
evils
are
conceived
of
as
invisible
or
as
embodied
in
a
material
form
is
a
circumstance
entirely
subordinate
to
the
main
object
of
the
ceremony
which
is
simply
to
effect
a
total
clearance
of
all
the
ills
that
have
been
infesting
a
people
if
any
link
were
wanting
to
connect
the
two
kinds
of
expulsion
it
would
be
furnished
by
such
a
practice
as
that
of
sending
the
evils
away
in
a
litter
or
a
boat
for
here
on
the
one
hand
the
evils
are
invisible
and
intangible
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
visible
and
tangible
vehicle
to
convey
them
away
and
a
scapegoat
is
nothing
more
than
such
a
vehicle
in
the
second
place
when
a
general
clearance
of
evils
is
resorted
to
periodically
the
interval
between
the
celebrations
of
the
ceremony
is
commonly
a
year
and
the
time
of
year
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
usually
coincides
with
some
change
of
season
such
as
the
beginning
or
end
of
winter
in
the
arctic
and
temperate
zones
and
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
rainy
season
in
the
tropics
the
increased
mortality
which
such
climatic
changes
are
apt
to
produce
especially
amongst
and
savages
is
set
down
by
primitive
man
to
the
agency
of
demons
who
must
accordingly
be
expelled
hence
in
the
tropical
regions
of
new
britain
and
peru
the
devils
are
or
were
driven
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
hence
on
the
dreary
coasts
of
baffin
land
they
are
banished
at
the
approach
of
the
bitter
arctic
winter
when
a
tribe
has
taken
to
husbandry
the
time
for
the
general
expulsion
of
devils
is
naturally
made
to
agree
with
one
of
the
great
epochs
of
the
agricultural
year
as
sowing
or
harvest
but
as
these
epochs
themselves
naturally
coincide
with
changes
of
season
it
does
not
follow
that
the
transition
from
the
hunting
or
pastoral
to
the
agricultural
life
involves
any
alteration
in
the
time
of
celebrating
this
great
annual
rite
some
of
the
agricultural
communities
of
india
and
the
hindoo
koosh
as
we
have
seen
hold
their
general
clearance
of
demons
at
harvest
others
at
but
at
whatever
season
of
the
year
it
is
held
the
general
expulsion
of
devils
commonly
marks
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
for
before
entering
on
a
new
year
people
are
anxious
to
rid
themselves
of
the
troubles
that
have
harassed
them
in
the
past
hence
it
comes
about
that
in
so
many
communities
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
is
inaugurated
with
a
solemn
and
public
banishment
of
evil
spirits
in
the
third
place
it
is
to
be
observed
that
this
public
and
periodic
expulsion
of
devils
is
commonly
preceded
or
followed
by
a
period
of
general
license
during
which
the
ordinary
restraints
of
society
are
thrown
aside
and
all
offences
short
of
the
gravest
are
allowed
to
pass
unpunished
in
guinea
and
tonquin
the
period
of
license
precedes
the
public
expulsion
of
demons
and
the
suspension
of
the
ordinary
government
in
lhasa
previous
to
the
expulsion
of
the
scapegoat
is
perhaps
a
relic
of
a
similar
period
of
universal
license
amongst
the
hos
of
india
the
period
of
license
follows
the
expulsion
of
the
devil
amongst
the
iroquois
it
hardly
appears
whether
it
preceded
or
followed
the
banishment
of
evils
in
any
case
the
extraordinary
relaxation
of
all
ordinary
rules
of
conduct
on
such
occasions
is
doubtless
to
be
explained
by
the
general
clearance
of
evils
which
precedes
or
follows
it
on
the
one
hand
when
a
general
riddance
of
evil
and
absolution
from
all
sin
is
in
immediate
prospect
men
are
encouraged
to
give
the
rein
to
their
passions
trusting
that
the
coming
ceremony
will
wipe
out
the
score
which
they
are
running
up
so
fast
on
the
other
hand
when
the
ceremony
has
just
taken
place
men
s
minds
are
freed
from
the
oppressive
sense
under
which
they
generally
labour
of
an
atmosphere
surcharged
with
devils
and
in
the
first
revulsion
of
joy
they
overleap
the
limits
commonly
imposed
by
custom
and
morality
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
at
the
elation
of
feeling
which
it
excites
is
further
stimulated
by
the
state
of
physical
wellbeing
produced
by
an
abundant
supply
of
food
fourthly
the
employment
of
a
divine
man
or
animal
as
a
scapegoat
is
especially
to
be
noted
indeed
we
are
here
directly
concerned
with
the
custom
of
banishing
evils
only
in
so
far
as
these
evils
are
believed
to
be
transferred
to
a
god
who
is
afterwards
slain
it
may
be
suspected
that
the
custom
of
employing
a
divine
man
or
animal
as
a
public
scapegoat
is
much
more
widely
diffused
than
appears
from
the
examples
cited
for
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
custom
of
killing
a
god
dates
from
so
early
a
period
of
human
history
that
in
later
ages
even
when
the
custom
continues
to
be
practised
it
is
liable
to
be
misinterpreted
the
divine
character
of
the
animal
or
man
is
forgotten
and
he
comes
to
be
regarded
merely
as
an
ordinary
victim
this
is
especially
likely
to
be
the
case
when
it
is
a
divine
man
who
is
killed
for
when
a
nation
becomes
civilized
if
it
does
not
drop
human
sacrifices
altogether
it
at
least
selects
as
victims
only
such
wretches
as
would
be
put
to
death
at
any
rate
thus
the
killing
of
a
god
may
sometimes
come
to
be
confounded
with
the
execution
of
a
criminal
if
we
ask
why
a
dying
god
should
be
chosen
to
take
upon
himself
and
carry
away
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
the
people
it
may
be
suggested
that
in
the
practice
of
using
the
divinity
as
a
scapegoat
we
have
a
combination
of
two
customs
which
were
at
one
time
distinct
and
independent
on
the
one
hand
we
have
seen
that
it
has
been
customary
to
kill
the
human
or
animal
god
in
order
to
save
his
divine
life
from
being
weakened
by
the
inroads
of
age
on
the
other
hand
we
have
seen
that
it
has
been
customary
to
have
a
general
expulsion
of
evils
and
sins
once
a
year
now
if
it
occurred
to
people
to
combine
these
two
customs
the
result
would
be
the
employment
of
the
dying
god
as
a
scapegoat
he
was
killed
not
originally
to
take
away
sin
but
to
save
the
divine
life
from
the
degeneracy
of
old
age
but
since
he
had
to
be
killed
at
any
rate
people
may
have
thought
that
they
might
as
well
seize
the
opportunity
to
lay
upon
him
the
burden
of
their
sufferings
and
sins
in
order
that
he
might
bear
it
away
with
him
to
the
unknown
world
beyond
the
grave
the
use
of
the
divinity
as
a
scapegoat
clears
up
the
ambiguity
which
as
we
saw
appears
to
hang
about
the
european
of
carrying
out
grounds
have
been
shewn
for
believing
that
in
this
ceremony
the
death
was
originally
the
spirit
of
vegetation
who
was
annually
slain
in
spring
in
order
that
he
might
come
to
life
again
with
all
the
vigour
of
youth
but
as
i
pointed
out
there
are
certain
features
in
the
ceremony
which
are
not
explicable
on
this
hypothesis
alone
such
are
the
marks
of
joy
with
which
the
effigy
of
death
is
carried
out
to
be
buried
or
burnt
and
the
fear
and
abhorrence
of
it
manifested
by
the
bearers
but
these
features
become
at
once
intelligible
if
we
suppose
that
the
death
was
not
merely
the
dying
god
of
vegetation
but
also
a
public
scapegoat
upon
whom
were
laid
all
the
evils
that
had
afflicted
the
people
during
the
past
year
joy
on
such
an
occasion
is
natural
and
appropriate
and
if
the
dying
god
appears
to
be
the
object
of
that
fear
and
abhorrence
which
are
properly
due
not
to
himself
but
to
the
sins
and
misfortunes
with
which
he
is
laden
this
arises
merely
from
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
or
at
least
of
marking
the
distinction
between
the
bearer
and
the
burden
when
the
burden
is
of
a
baleful
character
the
bearer
of
it
will
be
feared
and
shunned
just
as
much
as
if
he
were
himself
instinct
with
those
dangerous
properties
of
which
as
it
happens
he
is
only
the
vehicle
similarly
we
have
seen
that
and
boats
are
dreaded
and
shunned
by
east
indian
peoples
again
the
view
that
in
these
popular
customs
the
death
is
a
scapegoat
as
well
as
a
representative
of
the
divine
spirit
of
vegetation
derives
some
support
from
the
circumstance
that
its
expulsion
is
always
celebrated
in
spring
and
chiefly
by
slavonic
peoples
for
the
slavonic
year
began
in
spring
and
thus
in
one
of
its
aspects
the
ceremony
of
carrying
out
death
would
be
an
example
of
the
widespread
custom
of
expelling
the
accumulated
evils
of
the
old
year
before
entering
on
a
new
one
chapter
vi
human
scapegoats
in
classical
antiquity
the
human
scapegoat
in
ancient
rome
we
are
now
prepared
to
notice
the
use
of
the
human
scapegoat
in
classical
antiquity
every
year
on
the
fourteenth
of
march
a
man
clad
in
skins
was
led
in
procession
through
the
streets
of
rome
beaten
with
long
white
rods
and
driven
out
of
the
city
he
was
called
mamurius
veturius
that
is
the
old
mars
and
as
the
ceremony
took
place
on
the
day
preceding
the
first
full
moon
of
the
old
roman
year
which
began
on
the
first
of
march
the
man
must
have
represented
the
mars
of
the
past
year
who
was
driven
out
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
one
now
mars
was
originally
not
a
god
of
war
but
of
vegetation
for
it
was
to
mars
that
the
roman
husbandman
prayed
for
the
prosperity
of
his
corn
and
his
vines
his
and
his
copses
it
was
to
mars
that
the
priestly
college
of
the
arval
brothers
whose
business
it
was
to
sacrifice
for
the
growth
of
the
crops
addressed
their
petitions
almost
exclusively
and
it
was
to
mars
as
we
saw
that
a
horse
was
sacrificed
in
october
to
secure
an
abundant
harvest
moreover
it
was
to
mars
under
his
title
of
mars
of
the
woods
that
farmers
offered
sacrifice
for
the
welfare
of
their
cattle
we
have
already
seen
that
cattle
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
under
the
special
patronage
of
once
more
the
consecration
of
the
vernal
month
of
march
to
mars
seems
to
point
him
out
as
the
deity
of
the
sprouting
vegetation
thus
the
roman
custom
of
expelling
the
old
mars
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
in
spring
is
identical
with
the
slavonic
custom
of
carrying
out
death
if
the
view
here
taken
of
the
latter
custom
is
correct
the
similarity
of
the
roman
and
slavonic
customs
has
been
already
remarked
by
scholars
who
appear
however
to
have
taken
mamurius
veturius
and
the
corresponding
figures
in
the
slavonic
ceremonies
to
be
representatives
of
the
old
year
rather
than
of
the
old
god
of
vegetation
it
is
possible
that
ceremonies
of
this
kind
may
have
come
to
be
thus
interpreted
in
later
times
even
by
the
people
who
practised
them
but
the
personification
of
a
period
of
time
is
too
abstract
an
idea
to
be
primitive
however
in
the
roman
as
in
the
slavonic
ceremony
the
representative
of
the
god
appears
to
have
been
treated
not
only
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
but
also
as
a
scapegoat
his
expulsion
implies
this
for
there
is
no
reason
why
the
god
of
vegetation
as
such
should
be
expelled
the
city
but
it
is
otherwise
if
he
is
also
a
scapegoat
it
then
becomes
necessary
to
drive
him
beyond
the
boundaries
that
he
may
carry
his
sorrowful
burden
away
to
other
lands
and
in
fact
mamurius
veturius
appears
to
have
been
driven
away
to
the
land
of
the
oscans
the
enemies
of
rome
the
blows
with
which
the
old
mars
was
expelled
the
city
seem
to
have
been
administered
by
the
dancing
priests
of
mars
the
salii
at
least
we
know
that
in
their
songs
these
priests
made
mention
of
mamurius
veturius
and
we
are
told
that
on
a
day
dedicated
to
him
they
beat
a
hide
with
rods
it
is
therefore
highly
probable
that
the
hide
which
they
drubbed
on
that
day
was
the
one
worn
by
the
representative
of
the
deity
whose
name
they
simultaneously
chanted
thus
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
march
every
year
rome
witnessed
the
curious
spectacle
of
the
human
incarnation
of
a
god
chased
by
the
god
s
own
priests
with
blows
from
the
city
the
rite
becomes
at
least
intelligible
on
the
theory
that
the
man
so
beaten
and
expelled
stood
for
the
outworn
deity
of
vegetation
who
had
to
be
replaced
by
a
fresh
and
vigorous
young
divinity
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
when
everywhere
around
in
field
and
meadow
in
wood
and
thicket
the
vernal
flowers
the
sprouting
grass
and
the
opening
buds
and
blossoms
testified
to
the
stirring
of
new
life
in
nature
after
the
long
torpor
and
stagnation
of
winter
the
dancing
priests
of
the
god
derived
their
name
of
salii
from
the
leaps
or
dances
which
they
were
bound
to
execute
as
a
solemn
religious
ceremony
every
year
in
the
comitium
the
centre
of
roman
political
life
twice
a
year
in
the
spring
month
of
march
and
the
autumn
month
of
october
they
discharged
this
sacred
duty
and
as
they
did
so
they
invoked
saturn
the
roman
god
of
sowing
as
the
romans
sowed
the
corn
both
in
spring
and
autumn
and
as
down
to
the
present
time
in
europe
superstitious
rustics
are
wont
to
dance
and
leap
high
in
spring
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
crops
grow
high
we
may
conjecture
that
the
leaps
and
dances
performed
by
the
salii
the
priests
of
the
old
italian
god
of
vegetation
were
similarly
supposed
to
quicken
the
growth
of
the
corn
by
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
the
salii
were
not
limited
to
rome
similar
colleges
of
dancing
priests
are
known
to
have
existed
in
many
towns
of
ancient
italy
everywhere
we
may
conjecture
they
were
supposed
to
contribute
to
the
fertility
of
the
earth
by
their
leaps
and
dances
at
rome
they
were
divided
into
two
colleges
each
composed
of
twelve
members
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
number
twelve
was
fixed
with
reference
to
the
twelve
months
of
the
old
lunar
year
the
or
brethren
of
the
ploughed
fields
another
roman
college
of
priests
whose
functions
were
purely
agricultural
and
who
wore
as
a
badge
of
their
office
a
wreath
of
were
also
twelve
in
number
perhaps
for
a
similar
reason
nor
was
the
martial
equipment
of
the
salii
so
alien
to
this
peaceful
function
as
a
modern
reader
might
naturally
suppose
each
of
them
wore
on
his
head
a
peaked
helmet
of
bronze
and
at
his
side
a
sword
on
his
left
arm
he
carried
a
shield
of
a
peculiar
shape
and
in
his
right
hand
he
wielded
a
staff
with
which
he
smote
on
the
shield
till
it
rang
again
such
weapons
in
priestly
hands
may
be
turned
against
spiritual
foes
in
the
preceding
pages
we
have
met
with
many
examples
of
the
use
of
material
arms
to
rout
the
host
of
demons
who
oppress
the
imagination
of
primitive
man
and
we
have
seen
that
the
clash
and
clangour
of
metal
is
often
deemed
particularly
effective
in
putting
these
baleful
beings
to
flight
may
it
not
have
been
so
with
the
martial
priests
of
mars
we
know
that
they
paraded
the
city
for
days
together
in
a
regular
order
taking
up
their
quarters
for
the
night
at
a
different
place
each
day
and
as
they
went
they
danced
in
triple
time
singing
and
clashing
on
their
shields
and
taking
their
time
from
a
fugleman
who
skipped
and
postured
at
their
head
we
may
conjecture
that
in
so
doing
they
were
supposed
to
be
expelling
the
powers
of
evil
which
had
accumulated
during
the
preceding
year
or
six
months
and
which
the
people
pictured
to
themselves
in
the
form
of
demons
lurking
in
the
houses
temples
and
the
other
edifices
of
the
city
in
savage
communities
such
tumultuous
and
noisy
processions
often
parade
the
village
for
a
similar
purpose
similarly
we
have
seen
that
among
the
iroquois
men
in
fantastic
costume
used
to
go
about
collecting
the
sins
of
the
people
as
a
preliminary
to
transferring
them
to
the
scapegoat
dogs
and
we
have
met
with
many
examples
of
armed
men
rushing
about
the
streets
and
houses
to
drive
out
demons
and
evils
of
all
kinds
why
should
it
not
have
been
so
also
in
ancient
rome
the
religion
of
the
old
romans
is
full
of
relics
of
savagery
if
there
is
any
truth
in
this
conjecture
we
may
suppose
that
as
priests
of
a
god
who
manifested
his
power
in
the
vegetation
of
spring
the
salii
turned
their
attention
above
all
to
the
demons
of
blight
and
infertility
who
might
be
thought
by
their
maleficent
activity
to
counteract
the
genial
influence
of
the
kindly
god
and
to
endanger
the
farmer
s
prospects
in
the
coming
summer
or
winter
the
conjecture
may
be
supported
by
analogies
drawn
from
the
customs
of
modern
european
peasants
as
well
as
of
savages
thus
to
begin
with
savages
we
have
seen
that
at
the
time
of
sowing
the
khonds
drive
out
the
evil
spirits
spoilers
of
the
seed
from
every
house
in
the
village
the
expulsion
being
effected
by
young
men
who
beat
each
other
and
strike
the
air
violently
with
long
sticks
if
i
am
right
in
connecting
the
vernal
and
the
autumnal
processions
of
the
salii
with
the
vernal
and
the
autumnal
sowing
the
analogy
between
the
khond
and
the
roman
customs
would
be
very
close
in
west
africa
the
fields
of
the
king
of
whydah
according
to
an
old
french
traveller
are
hoed
and
sowed
before
any
of
his
subjects
has
leave
to
hoe
and
sow
a
foot
of
his
own
lands
these
labours
are
performed
thrice
a
year
the
chiefs
lead
their
people
before
the
king
s
palace
at
daybreak
and
there
they
sing
and
dance
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
half
of
these
people
are
armed
as
in
a
day
of
battle
the
other
half
have
only
their
farm
tools
they
go
all
together
singing
and
dancing
to
the
scene
of
their
labours
and
there
keeping
time
to
the
sound
of
the
instruments
they
work
with
such
speed
and
neatness
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
behold
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
return
and
dance
before
the
king
s
palace
this
exercise
refreshes
them
and
does
them
more
good
than
all
the
repose
they
could
from
this
account
we
might
infer
that
the
dancing
was
merely
a
recreation
of
the
and
that
the
music
of
the
band
had
no
other
object
than
to
animate
them
in
their
work
by
enabling
them
to
ply
their
mattocks
in
time
to
its
stirring
strains
but
this
inference
though
it
seems
to
have
been
drawn
by
the
traveller
who
has
furnished
the
account
would
probably
be
erroneous
for
if
half
of
the
men
were
armed
as
for
war
what
were
they
doing
in
the
fields
all
the
time
that
the
others
were
digging
a
clue
to
unravel
the
mystery
is
furnished
by
the
description
which
a
later
french
traveller
gives
of
a
similar
scene
witnessed
by
him
near
timbo
in
french
guinea
he
saw
some
natives
at
work
preparing
the
ground
for
sowing
it
is
a
very
curious
spectacle
fifty
or
sixty
blacks
in
a
line
with
bent
backs
are
smiting
the
earth
simultaneously
with
their
little
iron
tools
which
gleam
in
the
sun
ten
paces
in
front
of
them
marching
backwards
the
women
sing
a
well
marked
air
clapping
their
hands
as
for
a
dance
and
the
hoes
keep
time
to
the
song
between
the
workers
and
the
singers
a
man
runs
and
dances
crouching
on
his
hams
like
a
clown
while
he
whirls
about
his
musket
and
performs
other
manœuvres
with
it
two
others
dance
also
pirouetting
and
smiting
the
earth
here
and
there
with
their
little
hoe
all
that
is
necessary
for
exorcising
the
spirits
and
causing
the
grain
to
here
while
the
song
of
the
women
gives
the
time
to
the
strokes
of
the
hoes
the
dances
and
other
antics
of
the
armed
man
and
his
colleagues
are
intended
to
exorcise
or
ward
off
the
spirits
who
might
interfere
with
the
diggers
and
so
prevent
the
grain
from
sprouting
again
an
old
traveller
in
southern
india
tells
us
that
the
men
of
calicut
when
they
wish
to
sow
rice
observe
this
practice
first
they
plough
the
land
with
oxen
as
we
do
and
when
they
sow
the
rice
in
the
field
they
have
all
the
instruments
of
the
city
continually
sounding
and
making
merry
they
also
have
ten
or
twelve
men
clothed
like
devils
and
these
unite
in
making
great
rejoicing
with
the
players
on
the
instruments
in
order
that
the
devil
may
make
that
rice
very
we
may
suspect
that
the
noisy
music
is
played
and
the
mummers
cut
their
capers
for
the
purpose
rather
of
repelling
demons
than
of
inducing
them
to
favour
the
growth
of
the
rice
however
where
our
information
is
so
scanty
it
would
be
rash
to
dogmatize
perhaps
the
old
traveller
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
mummers
personated
devils
among
the
kayans
of
central
borneo
men
disguised
in
wooden
masks
and
great
masses
of
green
foliage
certainly
play
the
part
of
demons
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
rice
just
before
the
seed
is
committed
to
the
ground
and
it
is
notable
that
among
the
performances
which
they
give
on
this
occasion
are
war
dances
again
among
the
kaua
and
kobeua
indians
of
brazil
masked
men
who
represent
spirits
or
demons
of
fertility
perform
dances
or
rather
pantomimes
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
the
growth
of
plants
quickening
the
wombs
of
women
and
promoting
the
multiplication
of
animals
further
we
are
told
that
the
natives
of
aracan
dance
in
order
to
render
propitious
the
spirits
whom
they
believe
to
preside
over
the
sowing
and
over
the
harvest
there
are
definite
times
for
doing
it
and
we
may
say
that
in
their
eyes
it
is
as
it
were
an
act
of
another
people
who
dance
diligently
to
obtain
good
crops
are
the
tarahumare
indians
of
mexico
they
subsist
by
agriculture
and
their
thoughts
accordingly
turn
much
on
the
supply
of
rain
which
is
needed
for
their
fields
according
to
them
the
favour
of
the
gods
may
be
won
by
what
for
want
of
a
better
term
may
be
called
dancing
but
what
in
reality
is
a
series
of
monotonous
movements
a
kind
of
rhythmical
exercise
kept
up
sometimes
for
two
nights
by
dint
of
such
hard
work
they
think
to
prevail
upon
the
gods
to
grant
their
prayers
the
dancing
is
accompanied
by
the
song
of
the
shaman
in
which
he
communicates
his
wishes
to
the
unseen
world
describing
the
beautiful
effect
of
the
rain
the
fog
and
the
mist
on
the
vegetable
world
he
invokes
the
aid
of
all
the
animals
mentioning
each
by
name
and
also
calls
on
them
especially
the
deer
and
the
rabbit
to
multiply
that
the
people
may
have
plenty
to
eat
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
tarahumares
assert
that
the
dances
have
been
taught
them
by
the
animals
like
all
primitive
people
they
are
close
observers
of
nature
to
them
the
animals
are
by
no
means
inferior
creatures
they
understand
magic
and
are
possessed
of
much
knowledge
and
may
assist
the
tarahumares
in
making
rain
in
spring
the
singing
of
the
birds
the
cooing
of
the
dove
the
croaking
of
the
frog
the
chirping
of
the
cricket
all
the
sounds
uttered
by
the
denizens
of
the
greensward
are
to
the
indian
appeals
to
the
deities
for
rain
for
what
other
reason
should
they
sing
or
call
for
the
strange
behaviour
of
many
animals
in
the
early
spring
the
tarahumares
can
find
no
other
explanation
but
that
these
creatures
too
are
interested
in
rain
and
as
the
gods
grant
the
prayers
of
the
deer
expressed
in
its
antics
and
dances
and
of
the
turkey
in
its
curious
playing
by
sending
the
rain
they
easily
infer
that
to
please
the
gods
they
too
must
dance
as
the
deer
and
play
as
the
turkey
from
this
it
will
be
understood
that
dance
with
these
people
is
a
very
serious
and
ceremonious
matter
a
kind
of
worship
and
incantation
rather
than
the
two
principal
dances
of
these
indians
the
and
the
are
supposed
to
have
been
taught
them
by
the
turkey
and
the
deer
respectively
they
are
danced
by
numbers
of
men
and
women
the
two
sexes
keeping
apart
from
each
other
in
the
dance
while
the
shaman
sings
and
shakes
his
rattle
but
a
large
gathering
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
pray
to
the
gods
by
dancing
sometimes
the
family
dances
alone
the
father
teaching
the
boys
while
doing
agricultural
work
the
indians
often
depute
one
man
to
dance
near
the
house
while
the
others
attend
to
the
work
in
the
fields
it
is
a
curious
sight
to
see
a
lone
man
taking
his
devotional
exercise
to
the
tune
of
his
rattle
in
front
of
an
apparently
deserted
dwelling
the
lonely
worshipper
is
doing
his
share
of
the
general
work
by
bringing
down
the
fructifying
rain
and
by
warding
off
disaster
while
the
rest
of
the
family
and
their
friends
plant
hoe
weed
or
harvest
in
the
evening
when
they
return
from
the
field
they
may
join
him
for
a
little
while
but
often
he
goes
on
alone
dancing
all
night
and
singing
himself
hoarse
and
the
indians
told
me
that
this
is
the
very
hardest
kind
of
work
and
exhausting
even
to
them
solitary
worship
is
also
observed
by
men
who
go
out
hunting
deer
or
squirrels
for
a
communal
feast
every
one
of
them
dances
alone
in
front
of
his
house
for
two
hours
to
insure
success
on
the
hunt
and
when
putting
corn
to
sprout
for
the
making
of
the
owner
of
the
house
dances
for
a
while
that
the
corn
may
sprout
another
dance
is
thought
to
cause
the
grass
and
funguses
to
grow
and
the
deer
and
rabbits
to
multiply
and
another
is
supposed
to
draw
the
clouds
together
from
the
north
and
south
so
that
they
clash
and
descend
in
rain
the
cora
indians
of
mexico
celebrate
a
festival
of
sowing
shortly
before
they
commit
the
seed
of
the
maize
to
the
ground
the
festival
falls
in
june
because
that
is
the
month
when
the
rainy
season
sets
in
supplying
the
moisture
needed
for
the
growth
of
the
maize
at
the
festival
two
old
women
who
represent
the
goddesses
of
sowing
dance
side
by
side
and
imitate
the
process
of
sowing
by
digging
holes
in
the
earth
with
long
sticks
and
inserting
the
seed
of
the
maize
in
the
holes
whereupon
a
man
who
represents
the
morning
star
pours
water
on
the
buried
seeds
this
solemn
dance
is
accompanied
by
the
singing
of
an
appropriate
hymn
which
may
be
compared
to
the
song
of
the
arval
brothers
in
ancient
rome
we
have
seen
that
in
many
parts
of
germany
austria
and
france
the
peasants
are
still
or
were
till
lately
accustomed
to
dance
and
leap
high
in
order
that
the
crops
may
grow
tall
such
leaps
and
dances
are
sometimes
performed
by
the
sower
immediately
before
or
after
he
sows
the
seed
but
often
they
are
executed
by
the
people
on
a
fixed
day
of
the
year
which
in
some
places
is
twelfth
night
the
sixth
of
january
or
candlemas
the
second
of
february
or
walpurgis
night
that
is
the
eve
of
may
day
but
apparently
the
favourite
season
for
these
performances
is
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
namely
shrove
tuesday
in
such
cases
the
leaps
and
dances
are
performed
by
every
man
for
his
own
behoof
he
skips
and
jumps
merely
in
order
that
his
own
corn
or
flax
or
hemp
may
spring
up
and
thrive
but
sometimes
in
modern
europe
as
if
i
am
right
in
ancient
rome
the
duty
of
dancing
for
the
crops
was
committed
to
bands
or
troops
of
men
who
cut
their
capers
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
community
for
example
at
grub
in
the
swiss
canton
of
the
grisons
graubünden
the
practice
used
to
be
as
follows
the
peasants
of
grub
we
are
informed
have
still
some
hereditary
customs
in
that
they
assembled
in
some
years
mostly
at
the
time
of
the
summer
solstice
disguised
themselves
as
maskers
so
as
to
be
unrecognizable
armed
themselves
with
weapons
defensive
and
offensive
took
every
man
a
great
club
or
cudgel
marched
in
a
troop
together
from
one
village
to
another
and
executed
high
leaps
and
strange
antics
they
ran
full
tilt
at
each
other
struck
every
man
his
fellow
with
all
his
might
so
that
the
blow
resounded
and
clashed
their
great
staves
and
cudgels
hence
they
were
called
by
the
country
folk
the
these
foolish
pranks
they
played
from
a
superstitious
notion
that
their
corn
would
thrive
the
better
but
now
they
have
left
off
and
these
are
no
longer
in
any
another
authority
after
describing
the
custom
remarks
with
this
custom
was
formerly
connected
the
belief
that
its
observance
brought
a
fruitful
in
the
austrian
provinces
of
salzburg
and
tyrol
bands
of
mummers
wearing
grotesque
masks
with
bells
jingling
on
their
persons
and
carrying
long
sticks
or
poles
in
their
hands
used
formerly
to
run
and
leap
about
on
certain
days
of
the
year
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
good
crops
they
were
called
a
name
derived
from
perchta
berchta
or
percht
a
mythical
old
woman
whether
goddess
or
elf
who
is
well
known
all
over
south
germany
perchta
as
they
call
her
is
to
be
met
with
in
elsace
swabia
bavaria
austria
and
switzerland
but
nowhere
perhaps
so
commonly
as
in
salzburg
and
the
tyrol
in
the
tyrol
she
appears
as
a
little
old
woman
with
a
very
wrinkled
face
bright
lively
eyes
and
a
long
hooked
nose
her
hair
is
dishevelled
her
garments
tattered
and
torn
hence
they
say
to
a
slatternly
wench
you
are
a
regular
she
goes
about
especially
during
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
twelfth
night
epiphany
above
all
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
which
is
often
called
perchta
s
day
many
precautions
must
be
observed
during
these
mystic
days
in
order
not
to
incur
her
displeasure
for
she
is
mischievous
to
man
and
beast
if
she
appears
in
the
byre
a
distemper
breaks
out
among
the
cows
that
is
why
during
these
days
the
byres
must
be
kept
very
clean
and
straw
laid
on
the
threshold
otherwise
you
will
find
bald
patches
on
your
sheep
and
goats
next
morning
and
next
summer
the
hair
which
has
been
filched
from
the
animals
will
descend
in
from
the
sky
old
perchta
also
keeps
a
very
sharp
eye
on
spinners
during
the
twelve
days
she
inspects
all
distaffs
and
in
the
houses
and
if
she
finds
any
flax
or
tow
unspun
on
them
she
tears
it
to
bits
and
she
does
not
spare
the
lazy
spinner
for
she
scratches
her
and
smacks
her
fingers
so
that
they
bear
the
marks
of
it
for
the
rest
of
her
life
indeed
she
sometimes
does
much
more
for
she
rips
up
the
belly
of
the
sluggard
and
stuffs
it
with
flax
that
is
the
punishment
with
which
a
bavarian
mother
will
threaten
an
idle
jade
of
a
girl
who
has
left
some
flax
on
her
distaff
on
new
year
s
eve
however
they
say
in
bavaria
that
if
you
only
eat
plenty
of
the
rich
juicy
cakes
which
are
baked
for
perchta
on
her
day
the
old
woman
s
knife
will
glance
off
your
body
without
making
any
impression
on
it
perchta
often
comes
not
alone
but
attended
by
many
little
children
who
follow
her
as
chickens
waddle
after
the
mother
hen
and
if
you
should
see
any
little
child
lagging
behind
the
rest
and
blubbering
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
that
child
has
been
baptized
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
everybody
should
eat
pancakes
baked
of
meal
and
milk
or
water
if
anybody
does
not
do
so
old
perchta
comes
and
slits
up
his
stomach
takes
out
the
other
food
fills
up
the
vacuity
so
created
with
a
tangled
skein
and
bricks
and
then
sews
up
the
orifice
neatly
using
singularly
enough
a
ploughshare
for
a
needle
and
an
iron
chain
for
thread
in
other
or
the
same
places
she
does
the
same
thing
to
anybody
who
does
not
eat
herrings
and
dumplings
on
twelfth
night
some
say
that
she
rides
on
the
storm
like
the
wild
huntsman
followed
by
a
boisterous
noisy
pack
and
carrying
off
people
into
far
countries
yet
withal
old
perchta
has
her
redeeming
qualities
good
children
who
spin
diligently
and
learn
their
lessons
she
rewards
with
nuts
and
sugar
plums
it
has
even
been
affirmed
that
she
makes
the
ploughed
land
fruitful
and
causes
the
cattle
to
thrive
when
a
mist
floats
over
the
fields
the
peasants
see
her
figure
gliding
along
in
a
white
mantle
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
good
people
leave
the
remains
of
their
supper
for
her
on
the
table
and
when
they
have
gone
to
bed
and
all
is
quiet
in
the
house
she
comes
in
the
likeness
of
an
old
wizened
little
woman
with
all
the
children
about
her
and
partakes
of
the
broken
victuals
but
woe
to
the
prying
wight
who
peeps
at
her
through
the
many
a
man
has
been
blinded
by
her
for
a
whole
year
as
a
punishment
for
his
curiosity
the
processions
of
maskers
who
took
their
name
of
from
this
quaint
creation
of
the
popular
fancy
were
known
as
or
from
the
runs
and
leaps
which
the
men
took
in
their
wild
headlong
course
through
the
streets
and
over
the
fields
they
appear
to
have
been
held
in
all
the
alpine
regions
of
germany
but
are
best
known
to
us
in
the
tyrol
and
salzburg
the
appropriate
season
for
the
celebration
of
the
rite
was
perchta
s
day
that
is
twelfth
night
or
epiphany
the
sixth
of
january
but
in
some
places
it
was
held
on
shrove
tuesday
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
the
very
day
when
many
farmers
of
central
europe
jump
to
make
the
crops
grow
tall
corresponding
to
the
double
character
of
perchta
as
a
power
for
good
and
evil
the
maskers
are
divided
into
two
sets
known
respectively
as
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
at
lienz
in
the
tyrol
where
the
maskers
made
their
appearance
on
shrove
tuesday
the
beautiful
were
decked
with
ribbons
galloons
and
so
forth
while
the
ugly
made
themselves
as
hideous
as
they
could
by
hanging
rats
and
mice
chains
and
bells
about
their
persons
all
wore
on
their
heads
tall
pointed
caps
with
bells
attached
to
them
their
faces
were
concealed
by
masks
and
in
their
hands
they
all
carried
long
sticks
the
sticks
of
the
beautiful
were
adorned
with
ribbons
those
of
the
ugly
ended
in
the
heads
of
devils
thus
equipped
they
leaped
and
ran
about
the
streets
and
went
into
the
houses
amongst
them
was
a
clown
who
blew
ashes
and
soot
in
people
s
faces
through
a
it
was
all
very
merry
and
frolicsome
except
when
the
wild
perchta
herself
came
invisible
to
ordinary
eyes
upon
the
scene
then
her
namesakes
the
grew
wild
and
furious
too
they
scattered
and
fled
for
their
lives
to
the
nearest
house
for
as
soon
as
they
got
under
the
gutter
of
a
roof
they
were
safe
but
if
she
caught
them
she
tore
them
in
pieces
to
this
day
you
may
see
the
graves
where
the
mangled
bodies
of
her
victims
lie
buried
when
no
such
interruption
took
place
the
noisy
rout
of
maskers
rushed
madly
about
with
jingling
bells
and
resounding
cracks
of
whips
entering
the
houses
dancing
here
drinking
there
teasing
wayfarers
or
racing
from
village
to
village
like
the
wild
hunt
itself
in
the
sky
till
at
the
close
of
the
winter
day
the
church
bells
rang
the
then
at
last
the
wild
uproar
died
away
into
silence
such
tumultuous
masquerades
were
thought
to
be
very
beneficial
to
the
crops
a
bad
harvest
would
be
set
down
to
the
omission
of
the
to
skip
and
jump
about
in
their
usual
fashion
in
the
province
of
salzburg
the
mummers
are
also
divided
into
two
sets
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
the
ugly
are
properly
speaking
twelve
young
men
dressed
in
black
sheepskins
and
wearing
hoods
of
and
grotesque
wooden
masks
which
represent
either
coarse
human
features
with
long
teeth
and
horns
or
else
the
features
of
fabulous
animals
with
beaks
and
bristles
or
movable
jaws
they
all
carry
bells
both
large
and
small
fastened
to
broad
leathern
girdles
the
procession
was
headed
by
a
man
with
a
big
drum
and
after
him
came
lads
bearing
huge
torches
and
lanterns
fastened
to
tall
poles
for
in
salzburg
or
some
parts
of
it
these
mummers
played
their
pranks
by
night
behind
the
torchbearers
came
two
fools
a
male
and
a
female
the
latter
acted
by
a
lad
in
woman
s
clothes
the
male
fool
carried
a
roll
with
which
he
struck
at
all
women
or
girls
of
his
acquaintance
when
they
shewed
themselves
at
the
open
doors
or
windows
along
with
the
themselves
went
a
train
of
young
fellows
cracking
whips
blowing
horns
or
jingling
bells
the
ways
might
be
miry
and
the
night
pitch
dark
but
with
flaring
lights
the
procession
swept
rapidly
by
the
men
leaping
along
with
the
help
of
their
long
sticks
and
waking
the
echoes
of
the
slumbering
valley
by
their
loud
uproar
from
time
to
time
they
stopped
at
a
farm
danced
and
cut
their
capers
before
the
house
for
which
they
were
rewarded
by
presents
of
food
and
strong
drink
to
offer
them
money
would
have
been
an
insult
by
midnight
the
performance
came
to
an
end
and
the
tired
maskers
dispersed
to
their
homes
the
beautiful
in
salzburg
are
attired
very
differently
from
the
ugly
but
their
costume
varies
with
the
district
thus
in
the
pongau
district
the
distinctive
feature
of
their
costume
is
a
tall
and
heavy
framework
covered
with
bright
red
cloth
and
decorated
with
a
profusion
of
silver
jewelry
and
filagree
work
this
framework
is
sometimes
nine
or
ten
feet
high
and
forty
or
fifty
pounds
in
weight
the
performer
carries
it
above
his
head
by
means
of
iron
supports
resting
on
his
shoulders
or
his
back
to
run
or
jump
under
the
weight
of
such
an
encumbrance
is
impossible
the
dancer
has
to
content
himself
with
turning
round
and
round
slowly
and
clumsily
very
different
is
the
headdress
of
the
beautiful
in
the
pinzgau
district
of
salzburg
there
the
performers
are
dressed
in
scarlet
and
wear
straw
hats
from
which
bunches
of
white
feathers
arranged
like
fans
nod
and
flutter
in
the
wind
red
shoes
and
white
stockings
complete
their
attire
thus
lightly
equipped
they
hop
and
jump
and
stamp
briskly
in
the
dance
unlike
their
ugly
namesakes
who
seem
now
to
be
extinct
the
beautiful
still
parade
from
time
to
time
among
the
peasantry
of
the
salzburg
highlands
but
the
intervals
between
their
appearances
are
irregular
varying
from
four
to
seven
years
or
more
unlike
the
ugly
they
wear
no
masks
and
appear
in
full
daylight
always
on
perchta
s
day
twelfth
night
the
sixth
of
january
and
the
two
following
sundays
they
are
attended
by
a
train
of
followers
who
make
a
great
din
with
bells
whips
pipes
horns
rattles
and
chains
amongst
them
one
or
two
clowns
clothed
in
white
and
wearing
tall
pointed
hats
of
white
felt
with
many
jingling
bells
attached
to
them
play
a
conspicuous
part
they
carry
each
a
roll
stuffed
with
tow
and
with
this
instrument
they
strike
lightly
such
women
and
girls
among
the
spectators
as
they
desire
particularly
to
favour
another
attendant
carries
the
effigy
of
a
baby
in
swaddling
bands
made
of
linen
rags
and
fastened
to
a
string
this
effigy
he
throws
at
women
and
girls
and
then
pulls
back
again
but
he
does
this
only
to
women
and
girls
whom
he
respects
and
to
whom
he
wishes
well
at
johann
the
carry
drawn
swords
each
is
attended
by
a
lad
dressed
as
a
woman
and
they
are
followed
by
men
clad
in
black
sheepskins
wearing
the
masks
of
devils
and
holding
chains
in
their
hands
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
quaint
performances
still
enacted
by
the
and
their
attendants
in
the
austrian
highlands
the
subject
has
been
carefully
investigated
by
a
highly
competent
enquirer
she
has
visited
the
districts
witnessed
the
performances
collected
information
and
studied
the
costumes
it
may
be
well
to
quote
her
conclusion
if
we
enquire
into
the
inner
meaning
which
underlies
the
and
kindred
processions
we
must
confess
that
it
is
not
at
first
sight
obvious
and
that
the
original
meaning
appears
blurred
and
indistinct
nevertheless
from
many
features
which
they
present
in
common
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
processions
were
held
for
the
purpose
of
driving
away
demons
and
had
for
their
object
to
promote
fertility
in
favour
of
this
view
it
may
be
urged
first
of
all
that
their
appearance
is
everywhere
greeted
with
joy
because
it
promises
fertility
and
a
good
harvest
it
is
a
good
year
they
say
in
salzburg
if
the
processions
are
prevented
from
taking
place
dearth
and
a
bad
harvest
are
to
be
apprehended
the
peasants
of
the
tyrol
still
believe
that
the
more
run
about
the
better
will
the
year
be
and
therefore
they
treat
them
to
brandy
and
cakes
in
lienz
when
the
harvest
turns
out
ill
they
say
that
they
omitted
to
let
the
run
over
the
fields
and
for
that
reason
the
peasant
in
the
sarn
valley
gets
the
to
leap
about
on
his
fields
for
then
there
will
be
a
good
year
if
fertility
and
blessing
are
to
be
poured
out
on
field
house
and
homestead
it
is
obvious
that
everything
that
could
hinder
or
harm
must
be
averted
and
driven
away
when
we
consider
how
even
at
the
present
time
and
still
more
in
times
gone
by
much
that
is
harmful
is
attributed
to
the
malevolence
of
invisible
powers
we
can
readily
understand
why
people
should
resort
to
measures
which
they
deem
effective
for
the
purpose
of
disarming
these
malevolent
beings
now
it
is
a
common
belief
that
certain
masks
possess
the
virtue
of
banning
demons
and
that
loud
noise
and
din
are
a
means
of
keeping
off
evil
spirits
or
hindering
their
activity
in
the
procession
of
the
we
see
the
principle
of
the
banishment
of
evil
carried
out
in
practice
the
people
attack
the
evil
spirits
and
seek
to
chase
them
away
by
putting
on
frightful
masks
with
which
they
confront
the
demon
for
one
sort
of
malevolent
spirits
one
kind
of
mask
appears
suitable
and
for
another
another
this
spirit
is
daunted
by
this
mask
and
that
spirit
by
that
and
so
they
came
to
discriminate
originally
particular
masks
may
have
been
used
against
particular
evil
spirits
but
in
course
of
time
they
were
confused
the
individual
taste
of
the
maker
of
the
mask
counted
for
something
and
so
gradually
it
resulted
in
carving
all
kinds
of
horrible
fantastic
and
hideous
masks
which
had
nothing
in
common
but
their
general
tendency
to
frighten
away
all
evil
in
support
of
her
view
that
the
procession
of
the
aims
chiefly
at
banishing
demons
who
might
otherwise
blight
the
crops
lays
stress
on
the
bells
which
figure
so
prominently
in
the
costume
of
these
maskers
for
the
sound
of
bells
as
she
reminds
us
is
commonly
believed
to
be
a
potent
means
of
driving
evil
spirits
away
the
notion
is
too
familiar
to
call
for
proof
but
a
single
case
from
central
africa
may
be
cited
as
an
illustration
the
teso
people
who
inhabit
a
land
of
rolling
plains
between
mount
elgon
and
lake
kioga
make
use
of
bells
to
exorcise
the
storm
fiend
a
person
who
has
been
injured
by
a
flash
or
in
the
resulting
fire
wears
bells
round
his
ankles
for
weeks
afterwards
whenever
rain
threatens
and
rain
in
uganda
almost
always
comes
in
company
with
thunder
and
lightning
this
person
will
parade
the
village
for
an
hour
with
the
jingling
bells
upon
his
legs
and
a
wand
of
papyrus
in
his
hand
attended
by
as
many
of
his
family
as
may
happen
to
be
at
hand
and
not
employed
in
necessary
the
resemblance
of
such
men
with
their
bells
and
wands
to
the
austrian
with
their
bells
and
wands
is
on
the
theory
in
question
fairly
close
both
of
them
go
about
to
dispel
demons
by
the
sound
of
their
bells
and
probably
also
by
the
blows
of
their
rods
whatever
may
be
thought
of
their
efficacy
in
banning
fiends
certain
it
is
that
in
the
tyrol
where
the
play
their
pranks
the
chime
of
bells
is
used
for
the
express
purpose
of
causing
the
grass
to
grow
in
spring
thus
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
inn
especially
at
schwaz
on
the
of
april
there
reckoned
george
s
day
troops
of
young
fellows
go
about
ringing
bells
some
of
which
they
hold
in
their
hands
while
others
are
attached
to
their
persons
and
the
peasants
say
wherever
the
come
there
the
grass
grows
well
and
the
corn
bears
abundant
hence
the
are
welcomed
and
treated
wherever
they
go
formerly
it
is
said
they
wore
masks
like
the
but
afterwards
they
contented
themselves
with
blackening
their
faces
with
soot
in
other
parts
of
the
tyrol
the
processions
take
place
at
the
carnival
but
their
object
is
the
same
for
it
is
believed
that
by
this
noisy
procession
growth
in
general
but
especially
the
growth
of
the
meadows
is
again
at
bergell
in
the
swiss
canton
of
the
grisons
children
go
in
procession
on
the
first
of
march
ringing
bells
in
order
that
the
grass
may
so
in
hildesheim
on
the
afternoon
of
ascension
day
young
girls
ascend
the
church
tower
and
ring
all
the
church
bells
in
order
that
they
may
get
a
good
harvest
of
flax
the
girl
who
hanging
on
to
the
is
swung
highest
by
the
swing
of
the
bell
will
get
the
longest
here
the
sound
of
the
bells
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
flax
is
reinforced
by
the
upward
swing
of
the
bell
which
carrying
with
it
the
at
the
end
of
the
rope
naturally
causes
the
flax
in
like
manner
to
rise
high
in
the
air
it
is
a
simple
piece
of
imitative
magic
like
the
leaps
and
bounds
which
the
peasants
of
central
europe
often
execute
for
precisely
the
same
purpose
once
more
in
various
parts
of
the
tyrol
on
senseless
thursday
which
is
the
last
thursday
in
carnival
young
men
in
motley
attire
with
whips
and
brooms
run
about
cracking
their
whips
and
making
believe
to
sweep
away
the
onlookers
with
their
brooms
they
are
called
or
the
people
say
that
if
these
fellows
do
not
run
about
the
flax
will
not
thrive
and
that
on
the
contrary
the
more
of
them
run
about
the
better
will
the
flax
grow
and
where
there
are
many
of
them
there
will
be
much
maize
in
this
custom
the
cracking
of
the
whips
may
be
supposed
to
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
ringing
of
the
bells
by
frightening
and
banishing
the
demons
of
infertility
and
dearth
about
hall
in
the
northern
tyrol
the
ceremony
of
the
as
it
is
called
is
or
used
to
be
as
follows
a
generally
and
respected
rigs
himself
out
in
motley
and
hides
his
face
under
a
mask
round
his
waist
he
wears
a
girdle
crammed
with
rolls
while
in
his
hand
he
wields
a
long
whip
from
which
more
than
fifty
cracknels
dangle
on
a
string
thus
arrayed
he
suddenly
bursts
from
the
door
into
the
public
view
solicited
thereto
by
the
cries
of
the
street
urchins
who
have
been
anxiously
waiting
for
his
appearance
he
throws
amongst
them
the
string
of
cracknels
and
while
they
are
scrambling
for
these
dainties
he
lays
on
to
them
most
liberally
with
his
whip
having
faithfully
discharged
this
public
duty
he
marches
down
between
rows
of
peasants
who
have
meantime
taken
up
their
position
in
a
long
street
amongst
them
he
picks
out
one
who
is
to
run
before
him
the
man
selected
for
the
honour
accordingly
takes
to
his
heels
hotly
pursued
by
the
other
with
the
whip
who
lashes
the
feet
of
the
fugitive
till
he
comes
up
with
him
having
run
him
down
he
leads
him
back
to
the
alehouse
where
he
treats
him
to
a
roll
and
a
glass
of
wine
after
that
the
masker
runs
a
similar
race
with
another
man
and
so
it
goes
on
one
race
after
another
till
the
sun
sets
then
the
mummer
doffs
his
mask
and
leads
the
dance
in
the
alehouse
the
object
of
these
races
is
said
to
be
to
ensure
a
good
crop
of
flax
and
maize
in
these
races
of
mummers
whether
known
as
or
there
are
certain
features
which
it
is
difficult
to
explain
on
the
theory
that
the
aim
of
the
performers
is
simply
to
drive
away
demons
and
that
the
hideous
masks
which
they
assume
have
no
other
intention
than
that
of
frightening
these
uncanny
beings
for
observe
that
in
the
last
example
the
blows
of
the
whip
fall
not
on
the
airy
swarms
of
invisible
spirits
but
on
the
solid
persons
of
street
urchins
and
sturdy
yokels
who
can
hardly
be
supposed
to
receive
the
chastisement
vicariously
for
the
demons
again
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
rolls
and
cracknels
with
which
in
this
case
the
mummer
is
laden
and
which
he
distributes
among
his
victims
as
if
to
console
them
in
one
part
of
their
person
for
the
pain
which
he
has
inflicted
on
another
surely
this
bounty
seems
to
invest
him
with
something
more
than
the
purely
negative
character
of
an
exorciser
of
evil
it
appears
to
raise
him
to
the
positive
character
of
a
dispenser
of
good
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
action
of
the
who
strike
women
lightly
as
a
mark
of
friendship
and
regard
with
the
rolls
which
they
carry
in
their
hands
or
throw
them
as
a
mark
of
favour
the
effigy
of
a
baby
the
only
probable
explanation
of
these
practices
as
rightly
points
out
is
that
the
mummers
thereby
intend
to
fertilize
the
women
whom
they
honour
by
these
attentions
here
again
therefore
the
maskers
appear
as
the
actual
dispensers
of
good
the
bestowers
of
fruitfulness
not
merely
the
averters
of
evil
if
that
is
so
we
seem
bound
to
infer
that
these
masked
men
represent
or
embody
the
spirits
who
quicken
the
seed
both
in
the
earth
and
in
the
wombs
of
women
that
was
the
view
of
mannhardt
the
highest
authority
on
the
agricultural
superstitions
of
european
peasantry
after
reviewing
these
and
many
more
similar
processions
he
concludes
that
if
the
comparison
which
he
has
instituted
between
them
holds
good
all
these
various
mummers
were
intended
by
the
original
founders
of
the
processions
to
represent
demons
of
vegetation
who
by
their
mere
appearance
and
cries
drove
away
the
powers
that
hinder
growth
and
woke
to
new
life
the
slumbering
spirits
of
the
grasses
and
thus
mannhardt
admitted
that
these
noisy
processions
of
masked
men
are
really
supposed
to
dispel
the
evil
spirits
of
blight
and
infertility
while
at
the
same
time
he
held
that
the
men
themselves
originally
personated
and
he
thought
it
probable
that
the
original
significance
of
these
performances
was
in
later
times
misunderstood
and
interpreted
as
a
simple
expulsion
of
witches
and
other
uncanny
beings
that
haunt
the
fields
on
the
whole
this
conclusion
of
an
enquirer
remarkable
for
a
rare
combination
of
learning
sobriety
and
insight
is
perhaps
the
most
probable
that
can
now
be
reached
with
the
evidence
at
our
disposal
it
is
confirmed
by
some
of
the
savage
masquerades
in
which
the
maskers
definitely
represent
spirits
of
fertility
in
order
to
promote
the
fruitfulness
of
the
earth
and
of
women
and
it
is
supported
by
the
evidence
of
many
other
rustic
mummeries
in
europe
for
example
by
the
english
rites
of
plough
monday
in
which
the
dancers
or
rather
jumpers
who
wore
bunches
of
corn
in
their
hats
as
they
leaped
into
the
air
are
most
naturally
interpreted
as
agents
or
representatives
of
the
it
is
therefore
worth
observing
that
in
some
places
the
dancers
of
plough
monday
who
attended
the
plough
in
its
peregrinations
through
the
streets
and
fields
are
described
as
if
the
description
is
correct
it
implies
that
they
had
bells
attached
to
their
costume
which
would
further
assimilate
them
to
the
and
other
masqueraders
of
central
europe
for
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
is
that
the
performers
wear
bells
fastened
to
their
legs
which
jingle
at
every
step
we
may
suppose
that
if
the
men
who
ran
and
capered
beside
the
plough
on
plough
monday
really
wore
bells
the
original
intention
of
this
appendage
to
their
costume
was
either
to
dispel
the
demons
who
might
hinder
the
growth
of
the
corn
or
to
waken
the
spirits
of
vegetation
from
their
long
winter
sleep
in
favour
of
the
view
which
sees
in
all
these
dances
and
mummeries
rather
the
banishment
of
what
is
evil
than
the
direct
promotion
of
what
is
good
it
may
be
urged
that
some
of
the
dancers
wear
swords
a
weapon
which
certainly
seems
better
fitted
to
combat
demons
than
to
prune
or
turn
up
the
sod
further
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
many
of
the
performances
take
place
either
on
twelfth
day
or
like
the
celebration
of
plough
monday
very
shortly
after
it
and
that
in
the
lord
of
misrule
who
reigned
from
christmas
to
twelfth
day
we
have
a
clear
trace
of
one
of
those
periods
of
general
licence
and
suspension
of
ordinary
government
which
so
commonly
occur
at
the
end
of
the
old
year
or
the
beginning
of
the
new
one
in
connexion
with
a
general
expulsion
of
evils
surveying
these
masquerades
and
processions
as
they
have
been
or
still
are
celebrated
in
modern
europe
we
may
say
in
general
that
they
appear
to
have
been
originally
intended
both
to
stimulate
the
growth
of
vegetation
in
spring
and
to
expel
the
demoniac
or
other
evil
influences
which
were
thought
to
have
accumulated
during
the
preceding
winter
or
year
and
that
these
two
motives
of
stimulation
and
expulsion
blended
and
perhaps
confused
together
appear
to
explain
the
quaint
costumes
of
the
mummers
the
multitudinous
noises
which
they
make
and
the
blows
which
they
direct
either
at
invisible
foes
or
at
the
visible
and
tangible
persons
of
their
fellows
in
the
latter
case
the
beating
may
be
supposed
to
serve
as
a
means
of
forcibly
freeing
the
sufferers
from
the
demons
or
other
evil
things
that
cling
to
them
unseen
to
apply
these
conclusions
to
the
roman
custom
of
expelling
mamurius
veturius
or
the
old
mars
every
year
in
spring
we
may
say
that
they
lend
some
support
to
the
theory
which
sees
in
the
old
mars
the
outworn
deity
of
vegetation
driven
away
to
make
room
either
for
a
younger
and
more
vigorous
personification
of
vernal
life
or
perhaps
for
the
return
of
the
same
deity
refreshed
and
renovated
by
the
treatment
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
and
particularly
by
the
vigorous
application
of
the
rod
to
his
sacred
person
for
as
we
shall
see
presently
king
solomon
was
by
no
means
singular
in
his
opinion
of
the
refreshing
influence
of
a
sound
thrashing
so
far
as
the
old
mars
was
supposed
to
carry
away
with
him
the
accumulated
weaknesses
and
other
evils
of
the
past
year
so
far
would
he
serve
as
a
public
scapegoat
like
the
effigy
in
the
slavonic
custom
of
carrying
out
death
which
appears
not
only
to
represent
the
of
the
past
year
but
also
to
act
as
a
scapegoat
carrying
away
with
it
a
heavy
load
of
suffering
misfortune
and
death
the
human
scapegoat
in
ancient
greece
the
ancient
greeks
were
also
familiar
with
the
use
of
a
human
scapegoat
in
plutarch
s
native
town
of
chaeronea
a
ceremony
of
this
kind
was
performed
by
the
chief
magistrate
at
the
town
hall
and
by
each
householder
at
his
own
home
it
was
called
the
expulsion
of
a
slave
was
beaten
with
rods
of
the
and
turned
out
of
doors
with
the
words
out
with
hunger
and
in
with
wealth
and
when
plutarch
held
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
of
his
native
town
he
performed
this
ceremony
at
the
town
hall
and
he
has
recorded
the
discussion
to
which
the
custom
afterwards
gave
rise
the
ceremony
closely
resembles
the
japanese
hindoo
and
highland
customs
already
described
but
in
civilized
greece
the
custom
of
the
scapegoat
took
darker
forms
than
the
innocent
rite
over
which
the
amiable
and
pious
plutarch
presided
whenever
marseilles
one
of
the
busiest
and
most
brilliant
of
greek
colonies
was
ravaged
by
a
plague
a
man
of
the
poorer
classes
used
to
offer
himself
as
a
scapegoat
for
a
whole
year
he
was
maintained
at
the
public
expense
being
fed
on
choice
and
pure
food
at
the
expiry
of
the
year
he
was
dressed
in
sacred
garments
decked
with
holy
branches
and
led
through
the
whole
city
while
prayers
were
uttered
that
all
the
evils
of
the
people
might
fall
on
his
head
he
was
then
cast
out
of
the
city
or
stoned
to
death
by
the
people
outside
of
the
walls
the
athenians
regularly
maintained
a
number
of
degraded
and
useless
beings
at
the
public
expense
and
when
any
calamity
such
as
plague
drought
or
famine
befell
the
city
they
sacrificed
two
of
these
outcasts
as
scapegoats
one
of
the
victims
was
sacrificed
for
the
men
and
the
other
for
the
women
the
former
wore
round
his
neck
a
string
of
black
the
latter
a
string
of
white
figs
sometimes
it
seems
the
victim
slain
on
behalf
of
the
women
was
a
woman
they
were
led
about
the
city
and
then
sacrificed
apparently
by
being
stoned
to
death
outside
the
city
but
such
sacrifices
were
not
confined
to
extraordinary
occasions
of
public
calamity
it
appears
that
every
year
at
the
festival
of
the
thargelia
in
may
two
victims
one
for
the
men
and
one
for
the
women
were
led
out
of
athens
and
stoned
to
death
the
city
of
abdera
in
thrace
was
publicly
purified
once
a
year
and
one
of
the
burghers
set
apart
for
the
purpose
was
stoned
to
death
as
a
scapegoat
or
vicarious
sacrifice
for
the
life
of
all
the
others
six
days
before
his
execution
he
was
excommunicated
in
order
that
he
alone
might
bear
the
sins
of
all
the
from
the
lover
s
leap
a
white
bluff
at
the
southern
end
of
their
island
the
leucadians
used
annually
to
hurl
a
criminal
into
the
sea
as
a
scapegoat
but
to
lighten
his
fall
they
fastened
live
birds
and
feathers
to
him
and
a
flotilla
of
small
boats
waited
below
to
catch
him
and
convey
him
beyond
the
boundary
probably
these
humane
precautions
were
a
mitigation
of
an
earlier
custom
of
flinging
the
scapegoat
into
the
sea
to
drown
just
as
in
kumaon
the
custom
of
letting
a
man
slide
down
a
rope
from
the
top
of
a
cliff
appears
to
be
a
modification
of
an
older
practice
of
putting
him
to
death
the
leucadian
ceremony
took
place
at
the
time
of
a
sacrifice
to
apollo
who
had
a
temple
or
sanctuary
on
the
spot
elsewhere
it
was
customary
to
cast
a
young
man
every
year
into
the
sea
with
the
prayer
be
thou
our
this
ceremony
was
supposed
to
rid
the
people
of
the
evils
by
which
they
were
beset
or
according
to
a
somewhat
different
interpretation
it
redeemed
them
by
paying
the
debt
they
owed
to
the
as
practised
by
the
greeks
of
asia
minor
in
the
sixth
century
before
our
era
the
custom
of
the
scapegoat
was
as
follows
when
a
city
suffered
from
plague
famine
or
other
public
calamity
an
ugly
or
deformed
person
was
chosen
to
take
upon
himself
all
the
evils
which
afflicted
the
community
he
was
brought
to
a
suitable
place
where
dried
figs
a
barley
loaf
and
cheese
were
put
into
his
hand
these
he
ate
then
he
was
beaten
seven
times
upon
his
genital
organs
with
squills
and
branches
of
the
wild
fig
and
other
wild
trees
while
the
flutes
played
a
particular
tune
afterwards
he
was
burned
on
a
pyre
built
of
the
wood
of
forest
trees
and
his
ashes
were
cast
into
the
sea
a
similar
custom
appears
to
have
been
annually
celebrated
by
the
asiatic
greeks
at
the
harvest
festival
of
the
thargelia
in
the
ritual
just
described
the
scourging
of
the
victim
with
squills
branches
of
the
wild
fig
and
so
forth
can
not
have
been
intended
to
aggravate
his
sufferings
otherwise
any
stick
would
have
been
good
enough
to
beat
him
with
the
true
meaning
of
this
part
of
the
ceremony
has
been
explained
by
w
mannhardt
he
points
out
that
the
ancients
attributed
to
squills
a
magical
power
of
averting
evil
influences
and
that
accordingly
they
hung
them
up
at
the
doors
of
their
houses
and
made
use
of
them
in
purificatory
rites
hence
the
arcadian
custom
of
whipping
the
image
of
pan
with
squills
at
a
festival
or
whenever
the
hunters
returned
must
have
been
meant
not
to
punish
the
god
but
to
purify
him
from
the
harmful
influences
which
were
impeding
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
divine
functions
as
a
god
who
should
supply
the
hunter
with
game
similarly
the
object
of
beating
the
human
scapegoat
on
the
genital
organs
with
squills
and
so
on
must
have
been
to
release
his
reproductive
energies
from
any
restraint
or
spell
under
which
they
might
be
laid
by
demoniacal
or
other
malignant
agency
and
as
the
thargelia
at
which
he
was
annually
sacrificed
was
an
early
harvest
festival
celebrated
in
may
we
must
recognize
in
him
a
representative
of
the
creative
and
fertilizing
god
of
vegetation
the
representative
of
the
god
was
annually
slain
for
the
purpose
i
have
indicated
that
of
maintaining
the
divine
life
in
perpetual
vigour
untainted
by
the
weakness
of
age
and
before
he
was
put
to
death
it
was
not
unnatural
to
stimulate
his
reproductive
powers
in
order
that
these
might
be
transmitted
in
full
activity
to
his
successor
the
new
god
or
new
embodiment
of
the
old
god
who
was
doubtless
supposed
immediately
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
slain
similar
reasoning
would
lead
to
a
similar
treatment
of
the
scapegoat
on
special
occasions
such
as
drought
or
famine
if
the
crops
did
not
answer
to
the
expectation
of
the
husbandman
this
would
be
attributed
to
some
failure
in
the
generative
powers
of
the
god
whose
function
it
was
to
produce
the
fruits
of
the
earth
it
might
be
thought
that
he
was
under
a
spell
or
was
growing
old
and
feeble
accordingly
he
was
slain
in
the
person
of
his
representative
with
all
the
ceremonies
already
described
in
order
that
born
young
again
he
might
infuse
his
own
youthful
vigour
into
the
stagnant
energies
of
nature
on
the
same
principle
we
can
understand
why
mamurius
veturius
was
beaten
with
rods
why
the
slave
at
the
chaeronean
ceremony
was
beaten
with
the
a
tree
to
which
magical
properties
were
ascribed
why
the
effigy
of
death
in
some
parts
of
europe
is
assailed
with
sticks
and
stones
and
why
at
babylon
the
criminal
who
played
the
god
was
scourged
before
he
was
crucified
the
purpose
of
the
scourging
was
not
to
intensify
the
agony
of
the
divine
sufferer
but
on
the
contrary
to
dispel
any
malignant
influences
by
which
at
the
supreme
moment
he
might
conceivably
be
beset
thus
far
i
have
assumed
that
the
human
victims
at
the
thargelia
represented
the
spirits
of
vegetation
in
general
but
it
has
been
well
remarked
by
paton
that
these
poor
wretches
seem
to
have
masqueraded
as
the
spirits
of
in
particular
he
points
out
that
the
process
of
caprification
as
it
is
called
that
is
the
artificial
fertilization
of
the
cultivated
by
hanging
strings
of
wild
figs
among
the
boughs
takes
place
in
greece
and
asia
minor
in
june
about
a
month
after
the
date
of
the
thargelia
and
he
suggests
that
the
hanging
of
the
black
and
white
figs
round
the
necks
of
the
two
human
victims
one
of
whom
represented
the
men
and
the
other
the
women
may
have
been
a
direct
imitation
of
the
process
of
caprification
designed
on
the
principle
of
imitative
magic
to
assist
the
fertilization
of
the
and
since
caprification
is
in
fact
a
marriage
of
the
male
with
the
female
paton
further
supposes
that
the
loves
of
the
trees
may
on
the
same
principle
of
imitative
magic
have
been
simulated
by
a
mock
or
even
a
real
marriage
between
the
two
human
victims
one
of
whom
appears
sometimes
to
have
been
a
woman
on
this
view
the
practice
of
beating
the
human
victims
on
their
genitals
with
branches
of
wild
and
with
squills
was
a
charm
intended
to
stimulate
the
generative
powers
of
the
man
and
woman
who
for
the
time
being
personated
the
male
and
the
female
respectively
and
who
by
their
union
in
marriage
whether
real
or
pretended
were
believed
to
help
the
trees
to
bear
fruit
the
theory
is
ingenious
and
attractive
and
to
some
extent
it
is
borne
out
by
the
roman
celebration
of
the
which
i
have
described
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
for
on
the
the
ninth
of
july
the
female
slaves
in
the
attire
of
free
women
feasted
under
a
wild
cut
a
rod
from
the
tree
beat
each
other
perhaps
with
the
rod
and
offered
the
milky
juice
of
the
tree
to
the
goddess
juno
caprotina
whose
surname
seems
to
point
her
out
as
the
goddess
of
the
wild
here
the
rites
performed
in
july
by
women
under
the
wild
which
the
ancients
rightly
regarded
as
a
male
and
employed
to
fertilize
the
cultivated
female
can
hardly
be
dissociated
from
the
caprification
or
artificial
marriage
of
the
which
according
to
columella
was
best
performed
in
july
and
if
the
blows
which
the
women
gave
each
other
on
this
occasion
were
administered
as
seems
highly
probable
by
the
rod
which
they
cut
from
the
wild
the
parallel
between
the
roman
and
the
greek
ceremony
would
be
still
closer
since
the
greeks
as
we
saw
beat
the
genitals
of
the
human
victims
with
branches
of
wild
it
is
true
that
the
human
sacrifices
which
formed
so
prominent
a
feature
in
the
greek
celebration
of
the
thargelia
do
not
figure
in
the
roman
celebration
of
the
within
historical
times
yet
a
trace
of
them
may
perhaps
be
detected
in
the
tradition
that
romulus
himself
mysteriously
disappeared
on
that
very
day
in
the
midst
of
a
tremendous
while
he
was
reviewing
his
army
outside
the
walls
of
rome
at
the
goat
s
marsh
caprae
a
name
which
suggests
that
the
place
was
not
far
distant
from
the
wild
or
the
as
the
romans
called
it
where
the
slave
women
performed
their
curious
ceremonies
the
legend
that
he
was
cut
in
pieces
by
the
patricians
who
carried
away
the
morsels
of
his
body
under
their
robes
and
buried
them
in
the
earth
exactly
describes
the
treatment
which
the
khonds
used
to
accord
to
the
bodies
of
the
human
victims
for
the
purpose
of
fertilizing
their
fields
can
the
king
have
played
at
rome
the
same
fatal
part
in
the
fertilization
of
which
if
paton
is
right
was
played
in
greece
by
the
male
victim
the
traditionary
time
place
and
manner
of
his
death
all
suggest
it
so
many
coincidences
between
the
greek
and
roman
ceremonies
and
traditions
can
hardly
be
wholly
accidental
and
accordingly
i
incline
to
think
that
there
may
well
be
an
element
of
truth
in
paton
s
theory
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
ancient
writers
who
describe
the
greek
custom
appear
to
regard
it
merely
as
a
purification
of
the
city
and
not
at
all
as
a
mode
of
fertilizing
in
similar
ceremonies
which
combine
the
elements
of
purification
and
fertilization
the
notion
of
purification
apparently
tends
gradually
to
overshadow
the
notion
of
fertilization
in
the
minds
of
those
who
practise
the
rites
it
seems
to
have
been
so
in
the
case
of
the
annual
expulsion
of
mamurius
veturius
from
ancient
rome
and
in
the
parallel
processions
of
the
in
modern
europe
it
may
have
been
so
also
in
the
case
of
the
human
sacrifices
at
the
thargelia
the
interpretation
which
i
have
adopted
of
the
custom
of
beating
the
human
scapegoat
with
certain
plants
is
supported
by
many
analogies
we
have
already
met
with
examples
of
a
practice
of
beating
sick
people
with
the
leaves
of
certain
plants
or
with
branches
in
order
to
rid
them
of
noxious
influences
some
of
the
dravidian
tribes
of
northern
india
who
attribute
epilepsy
hysteria
and
similar
maladies
to
demoniacal
possession
endeavour
to
cure
the
sufferer
by
thrashing
him
soundly
with
a
sacred
iron
chain
which
is
believed
to
have
the
effect
of
immediately
expelling
the
demon
when
a
herd
of
camels
refuses
to
drink
the
arabs
will
sometimes
beat
the
male
beasts
on
the
back
to
drive
away
the
jinn
who
are
riding
them
and
frightening
the
females
in
bikol
the
part
of
luzon
it
was
generally
believed
that
if
the
evil
spirit
aswang
were
not
properly
exorcised
he
took
possession
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
tormented
them
hence
to
deliver
a
corpse
from
his
clutches
the
native
priestesses
used
to
beat
it
with
a
brush
or
whisk
made
of
the
leaves
of
the
aromatic
china
orange
while
they
chanted
a
certain
song
throwing
their
bodies
into
contortions
and
uttering
shrill
cries
as
if
the
evil
spirit
had
entered
into
themselves
the
soul
of
the
deceased
thus
delivered
from
the
cruel
tyranny
of
aswang
was
then
free
to
roam
at
pleasure
along
the
charming
lanes
or
in
the
thick
shade
of
the
forest
sometimes
it
appears
that
a
beating
is
administered
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
people
of
a
ghost
who
may
be
clinging
too
closely
to
their
persons
in
such
cases
the
blows
though
they
descend
on
the
bodies
of
the
living
are
really
aimed
at
the
spirit
of
the
dead
and
have
no
other
object
than
to
drive
it
away
just
as
a
coachman
will
flick
the
back
of
a
horse
with
his
whip
to
rid
the
beast
of
a
fly
at
a
funeral
in
the
island
of
halmahera
before
the
coffin
is
lowered
into
the
grave
all
the
relations
whip
themselves
on
the
head
and
shoulders
with
wands
made
of
plants
which
are
believed
to
possess
the
power
of
keeping
off
evil
spirits
the
intention
of
the
custom
is
said
to
be
to
bring
back
their
own
spectres
or
souls
and
to
prevent
them
from
following
the
ghost
but
this
may
fairly
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
blows
are
directed
to
brushing
off
the
ghost
who
would
otherwise
abstract
the
soul
of
the
person
on
whose
body
he
was
allowed
to
settle
this
interpretation
is
strongly
confirmed
by
the
practice
observed
by
the
same
people
on
the
same
occasion
of
throwing
the
trunk
of
a
into
the
grave
and
telling
the
dead
man
that
it
is
a
companion
for
him
for
this
practice
is
expressly
intended
to
prevent
the
deceased
from
feeling
lonely
and
so
coming
back
to
fetch
away
a
friend
when
batchelor
returned
to
a
hut
after
visiting
the
grave
of
an
old
aino
woman
her
relations
brought
him
a
bowl
of
water
to
the
door
and
requested
him
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
while
he
did
so
the
women
beat
him
and
brushed
him
down
with
sacred
whittled
sticks
on
enquiring
into
the
meaning
of
this
treatment
he
discovered
that
it
was
intended
to
purify
him
from
all
uncleanness
contracted
at
the
grave
through
contact
with
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
and
that
the
beating
and
brushing
with
the
whittled
sticks
had
for
its
object
to
drive
away
all
evil
influences
and
diseases
with
which
the
ghost
of
the
old
woman
might
have
attempted
to
infect
him
out
of
spite
for
his
trespassing
on
her
domain
the
banmanas
of
senegambia
think
that
the
soul
of
a
dead
infant
becomes
for
a
time
a
wandering
and
maleficent
spirit
accordingly
when
a
baby
dies
all
the
uncircumcised
children
of
the
same
sex
in
the
village
run
about
the
streets
in
a
band
each
armed
with
three
or
four
supple
rods
some
of
them
enter
every
house
to
beg
and
while
they
are
doing
so
one
of
the
troop
propping
himself
against
the
wall
with
his
hands
is
lashed
by
another
of
the
children
on
his
back
or
legs
till
the
blood
flows
each
of
the
children
takes
it
in
turn
to
be
thus
whipped
the
object
of
the
whipping
we
are
told
appears
to
be
to
preserve
the
uncircumcised
child
from
being
carried
off
by
its
comrade
who
has
just
the
severe
scourgings
inflicted
on
each
other
by
some
south
american
indians
at
ceremonies
connected
with
the
dead
may
be
similarly
intended
to
chase
away
the
dangerous
ghost
who
is
conceived
as
sticking
like
a
leech
or
a
bur
to
the
skin
of
the
living
the
ancient
greeks
employed
the
laurel
very
commonly
as
an
instrument
of
ceremonial
purification
and
from
the
monuments
which
represent
the
purgation
of
orestes
from
the
guilt
of
matricide
it
seems
probable
that
the
regular
rite
of
cleansing
a
homicide
consisted
essentially
in
sprinkling
him
with
pig
s
blood
and
beating
him
with
a
laurel
bough
for
the
purpose
as
we
may
conjecture
of
whisking
away
the
wrathful
ghost
of
his
victim
who
was
thought
to
buzz
about
him
like
an
angry
wasp
in
summer
if
that
was
so
the
greek
ritual
of
purification
singularly
resembles
the
nicobarese
ceremony
of
exorcism
for
when
a
man
is
supposed
to
be
possessed
by
devils
the
nicobarese
rub
him
all
over
with
pig
s
blood
and
beat
him
with
bunches
of
certain
leaves
to
which
a
special
power
of
exorcising
demons
is
attributed
as
fast
as
each
devil
is
thus
disengaged
from
his
person
it
is
carefully
folded
up
in
leaves
to
be
afterwards
thrown
into
the
sea
at
daybreak
at
the
autumn
festival
in
peru
people
used
to
strike
each
other
with
torches
saying
let
all
harm
go
every
year
when
the
pleiades
reappeared
in
the
sky
the
guaycurus
an
indian
nation
of
the
gran
chaco
held
a
festival
of
rejoicing
at
which
men
women
and
children
all
thrashed
each
other
expecting
thereby
to
procure
health
abundance
and
victory
over
their
enemies
indians
of
the
quixos
in
south
america
before
they
set
out
on
a
long
hunting
expedition
cause
their
wives
to
whip
them
with
nettles
believing
that
this
renders
them
fleeter
and
helps
them
to
overtake
the
peccaries
they
resort
to
the
same
proceeding
as
a
cure
for
sickness
the
roocooyen
indians
of
french
guiana
train
up
young
people
in
the
way
they
should
go
by
causing
them
to
be
stung
by
ants
and
wasps
and
at
the
ceremony
held
for
this
purpose
the
people
improve
the
occasion
by
allowing
themselves
to
be
whacked
by
the
chief
with
a
stick
over
the
arms
the
legs
and
the
chest
they
appear
to
labour
under
an
impression
that
this
conveys
to
them
all
sorts
of
moral
and
physical
excellences
one
of
the
tribe
ambitious
of
acquiring
the
european
virtues
begged
a
french
traveller
to
be
so
kind
as
to
give
him
a
good
hiding
the
traveller
obligingly
did
his
best
to
gratify
him
and
the
face
of
the
indian
beamed
with
gratitude
as
the
blows
fell
on
his
naked
back
the
delaware
indians
had
two
sovereign
remedies
for
sin
one
was
an
emetic
the
other
a
thrashing
in
the
latter
case
the
remedy
was
administered
by
means
of
twelve
different
sticks
with
which
the
sinner
was
belaboured
from
the
soles
of
his
feet
up
to
his
neck
in
both
cases
the
sins
were
supposed
to
be
expelled
from
the
body
and
to
pass
out
through
the
throat
at
the
inauguration
of
a
king
in
ancient
india
it
was
customary
for
the
priests
to
strike
him
lightly
on
the
back
with
sticks
by
beating
him
with
sticks
it
was
said
they
guide
him
safely
over
judicial
punishment
whence
the
king
is
exempt
from
punishment
because
they
guide
him
safely
over
judicial
on
the
thirtieth
of
december
the
heathen
of
harran
used
to
receive
three
five
or
seven
blows
apiece
from
a
priest
with
a
tamarisk
branch
after
the
beating
had
been
duly
administered
the
priest
on
behalf
of
the
whole
community
prayed
for
long
life
much
offspring
power
and
glory
over
all
peoples
and
the
restoration
of
their
ancient
kingdom
sometimes
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
resort
to
it
the
effect
of
a
beating
is
not
merely
the
negative
one
of
dispelling
demoniac
or
other
baneful
influences
it
confers
positive
benefits
by
virtue
of
certain
useful
properties
supposed
to
inhere
in
the
instrument
with
which
the
beating
is
administered
thus
among
the
kai
of
german
new
guinea
when
a
man
wishes
to
make
his
banana
shoots
bear
fruit
quickly
he
beats
them
with
a
stick
cut
from
a
which
has
already
borne
fruit
here
it
is
obvious
that
fruitfulness
is
believed
to
inhere
in
a
stick
cut
from
a
fruitful
tree
and
to
be
imparted
by
contact
to
the
young
banana
plants
similarly
in
new
caledonia
a
man
will
beat
his
taro
plants
lightly
with
a
branch
saying
as
he
does
so
i
beat
this
taro
that
it
may
grow
after
which
he
plants
the
branch
in
the
ground
at
the
end
of
the
field
among
the
indians
of
brazil
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
when
a
man
wishes
to
increase
the
size
of
his
generative
organ
he
strikes
it
with
the
fruit
of
a
white
aquatic
plant
called
an
which
grows
luxuriantly
on
the
banks
of
the
river
the
fruit
which
is
inedible
resembles
a
banana
and
is
clearly
chosen
for
this
purpose
on
account
of
its
shape
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
three
days
before
or
after
the
new
moon
in
the
county
of
bekes
in
hungary
barren
women
are
fertilized
by
being
struck
with
a
stick
which
has
first
been
used
to
separate
pairing
dogs
here
a
fertilizing
virtue
is
clearly
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
the
stick
and
to
be
conveyed
by
contact
to
the
women
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
think
that
the
plant
has
a
strong
soul
because
when
it
is
lopped
it
soon
grows
up
again
hence
when
a
man
is
ill
his
friends
will
sometimes
beat
him
on
the
crown
of
the
head
with
leaves
in
order
to
strengthen
his
weak
soul
with
the
strong
soul
of

small
boys
are
beaten
lightly
with
sticks
during

to
make

and
among

arabs
of

the
great
feast
which
is
the
annual
sacrificial
festival
of
mohammedan
peoples
is
the
occasion
when
men
go
about
beating
people
with
the
kindly
intention
of
healing
or
preventing
sickness
and
benefiting
the
sufferers
generally
in
some
tribes
the
operator
is
muffled
in
the
bloody
skins
of
sacrificed
sheep
and
he
strikes
everybody
within
reach
of
him
with
a
flap
of

order
to
receive
the
blows
and
mothers
bring
their
little
children
to
him
for
the
same
purpose
anybody
whom
he
hits
on
the
head
will
be
free
from
headache
nor
does
he
confine
his
attention
to
people
he
goes
about
striking
the
tents
also
in
order
that
they
too
may
receive
their
share
of
the
blessed
influence
that
radiates
like
sunshine
from
a
bloody
sheepskin
from
the
costume
which
he
wears
the
masker
is
known
as
the
lion
with
sheepskins
and
he
himself
participates
in
the
blessings
which
he
diffuses
so
liberally
around
him
hence
in
at
least
one
tribe
he
is
generally
a
person
who
suffers
from
some
illness
because
he
expects
to
be
healed
by
the
magic
virtue
or
holiness
of
the
bloody
skins
similarly
as
we
shall
see
presently
in
ancient
mexico
the
men
who
masqueraded
in
the
skins
of
the
human
victims
were
commonly
persons
who
suffered
from
skin
disease
because
they
thought
that
the
bleeding
skin
of
a
man
who
had
been
killed
in
the
character
of
a
god
must
surely
possess
a
sovereign
virtue
for
the
healing
of
disease
in
morocco
the
mummer
sometimes
operates
with
sticks
instead
of
a
flap
of
the
skin
and
sometimes
the
skins
in
which
he
is
muffled
are
those
of
goats
instead
of
sheep
but
in
all
cases
the
effect
or
at
least
the
intention
is
probably
the
same
in
some
parts
of
eastern
and
central
europe
a
similar
custom
is
very
commonly
observed
in
spring
on
the
first
of
march
the
albanians
strike
men
and
beast
with
cornel
branches
believing
that
this
is
very
good
for
their
health
in
march
the
greek
peasants
of
cos
switch
their
cattle
saying
it
is
march
and
up
with
your
tail
they
think
that
the
ceremony
benefits
the
animals
and
brings
good
luck
it
is
never
observed
at
any
other
time
of
the
year
in
some
parts
of
mecklenburg
it
is
customary
to
beat
the
cattle
before
sunrise
on
the
morning
of
good
friday
with
rods
of
buckthorn
which
are
afterwards
concealed
in
some
secret
place
where
neither
sun
nor
moon
can
shine
on
them
the
belief
is
that
though
the
blows
light
upon
the
animals
the
pain
of
them
is
felt
by
the
witches
who
are
riding
the
beasts
in
the
neighbourhood
of
iserlohn
in
westphalia
the
herdsman
rises
at
peep
of
dawn
on
may
morning
climbs
a
hill
and
cuts
down
the
young
which
is
the
first
to
catch
the
beams
of
the
rising
sun
with
this
he
returns
to
the
the
heifer
which
the
farmer
desires
to
quicken
is
then
led
to
the
dunghill
and
the
herdsman
strikes
it
over
the
the
haunches
and
the
udders
with
a
branch
of
the
saying
quick
quick
milk
into
the
sap
is
in
the
heifer
receives
a
quick
quick
milk
into
the
sap
comes
in
the
beeches
leaf
comes
on
the
quick
quick
milk
into
the
the
name
of
the
sainted
greta
shall
be
thy
name
and
so
on
the
intention
of
the
ceremony
appears
to
be
to
make
sure
that
the
heifer
shall
in
due
time
yield
a
plentiful
supply
of
milk
and
this
is
perhaps
supposed
to
be
brought
about
by
driving
away
the
witches
who
are
particularly
apt
as
we
have
seen
to
rob
the
cows
of
their
milk
on
the
morning
of
may
day
certainly
in
the
of
scotland
pieces
of
and
woodbine
used
to
be
placed
over
the
doors
of
the
byres
on
may
day
to
keep
the
witches
from
the
cows
sometimes
a
single
rod
of
rowan
covered
with
notches
was
found
to
answer
the
purpose
an
even
more
effectual
guard
against
witchcraft
was
to
tie
a
small
cross
of
by
a
scarlet
thread
to
each
beast
s
tail
hence
people
said
in
the
witches
t
their
in
germany
also
the
is
a
protection
against
witchcraft
and
norwegian
sailors
and
fishermen
carry
a
piece
of
it
in
their
boats
for
good
luck
thus
the
benefit
to
young
cows
of
beating
them
with
rowan
appears
to
be
not
so
much
the
positive
one
of
pouring
milk
into
their
udders
as
merely
the
negative
one
of
averting
evil
influence
and
the
same
may
perhaps
be
said
of
most
of
the
beatings
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
on
good
friday
and
the
two
previous
days
people
in
croatia
and
slavonia
take
rods
with
them
to
church
and
when
the
service
is
over
they
beat
each
other
fresh
and
in
some
parts
of
russia
people
returning
from
the
church
on
palm
sunday
beat
the
children
and
servants
who
have
stayed
at
home
with
palm
branches
saying
sickness
into
the
forest
health
into
the
a
similar
custom
is
widely
known
under
the
name
of
or
easter
smacks
in
some
parts
of
germany
and
austria
the
regions
in
which
the
practice
prevails
are
for
the
most
part
districts
in
which
the
people
either
are
or
once
were
predominantly
of
slavonic
blood
such
as
east
and
west
prussia
voigtland
silesia
bohemia
and
moravia
while
the
german
population
call
the
custom
the
slavonic
inhabitants
give
it
according
to
their
particular
language
or
dialect
a
variety
of
names
which
signify
to
beat
or
scourge
it
is
usually
observed
on
easter
monday
less
frequently
on
easter
saturday
or
easter
sunday
troops
of
boys
or
lads
go
from
house
to
house
on
the
morning
of
easter
monday
beating
every
girl
or
woman
whom
they
meet
they
even
make
their
way
into
the
bedrooms
and
if
they
find
any
girls
or
women
still
abed
they
compel
them
with
blows
to
get
up
even
men
indulge
themselves
in
the
pastime
of
going
to
the
houses
of
friends
and
relations
to
inflict
the
easter
in
some
places
for
example
in
the
leobschütz
district
of
silesia
the
boys
and
men
further
claim
and
exercise
the
right
of
drenching
all
the
girls
and
women
with
water
on
easter
monday
and
for
this
purpose
they
generally
go
about
armed
with
squirts
which
are
not
always
charged
with
eau
de
cologne
next
day
easter
tuesday
the
women
have
the
right
to
retaliate
on
the
men
however
they
do
not
as
a
rule
go
about
the
streets
but
confine
their
operations
to
their
own
houses
beating
and
chasing
from
their
beds
any
lads
or
men
they
can
find
lying
in
them
children
are
less
discriminating
in
their
easter
smacks
which
they
bestow
impartially
on
parents
and
relations
friends
and
strangers
without
observing
the
subtle
distinction
of
sex
in
many
places
it
is
only
the
women
who
are
privileged
to
receive
the
smacks
the
instrument
with
which
the
beating
is
administered
is
in
some
districts
such
as
lithuania
samland
and
neumark
a
twig
or
branch
of
birch
on
which
the
fresh
green
leaves
have
just
sprouted
if
the
have
not
budded
in
time
it
is
customary
to
keep
the
rods
in
pickle
for
days
or
even
weeks
nursing
them
tenderly
in
warm
water
and
if
that
measure
also
fails
they
are
heated
in
the
but
more
commonly
the
instrument
of
torture
is
a
branch
of
willow
with
catkins
on
it
which
has
also
been
nursed
in
warm
water
or
the
chimney
so
as
to
be
ripe
for
execution
on
easter
monday
a
number
of
these
birch
or
willow
twigs
are
usually
tied
together
into
a
switch
and
ornamented
with
motley
ribbons
and
pieces
of
silk
paper
so
that
they
present
the
appearance
of
a
nosegay
indeed
in
northern
bohemia
spring
flowers
form
part
of
the
decoration
in
some
places
particularly
in
silesia
and
moravia
pieces
of
licorice
root
are
substituted
for
willow
twigs
or
again
in
the
districts
of
bohemia
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
sometimes
a
scourge
made
of
leather
straps
of
various
colours
takes
the
place
of
a
green
bough
the
blows
are
commonly
inflicted
on
the
hands
and
feet
and
in
some
places
particularly
in
bohemia
the
victims
are
expected
to
reward
their
tormentors
with
a
present
of
red
easter
eggs
nay
sometimes
a
woman
is
bound
to
give
an
egg
for
every
blow
she
receives
in
the
afternoon
the
lads
carry
their
eggs
to
high
ground
and
let
them
roll
down
the
slope
he
whose
egg
reaches
the
bottom
first
wins
all
the
rest
the
beating
is
supposed
to
bring
good
luck
to
the
beaten
or
to
warrant
them
against
flies
and
vermin
during
the
summer
or
to
save
them
from
pains
in
their
back
throughout
the
whole
year
at
gilgenburg
in
masuren
the
rods
or
bundles
of
twigs
are
afterwards
laid
by
and
used
to
drive
the
cattle
out
to
pasture
for
the
first
time
after
their
winter
confinement
in
some
parts
of
germany
and
austria
a
custom
like
that
of
easter
smacks
is
observed
at
the
christmas
holidays
especially
on
holy
innocents
day
the
of
december
young
men
and
women
beat
each
other
mutually
but
on
different
days
with
branches
of
fresh
green
whether
birch
willow
or
fir
thus
for
example
among
the
germans
of
western
bohemia
it
is
customary
on
barbara
s
day
the
fourth
of
december
to
cut
twigs
or
branches
of
birch
and
to
steep
them
in
water
in
order
that
they
may
put
out
leaves
or
buds
they
are
afterwards
used
by
each
sex
to
beat
the
other
on
subsequent
days
of
the
christmas
holidays
in
some
villages
branches
of
willow
or
or
rosemary
are
employed
for
the
same
purpose
with
these
green
boughs
sometimes
tied
in
bundles
with
red
or
green
ribbons
the
young
men
go
about
beating
the
young
women
on
the
morning
of
stephen
s
day
the
of
december
and
also
on
holy
innocents
day
the
of
december
the
beating
is
inflicted
on
the
hands
feet
and
face
and
in
neugramatin
it
is
said
that
she
who
is
not
thus
beaten
with
fresh
green
will
not
herself
be
fresh
and
green
as
the
blows
descend
the
young
men
recite
verses
importing
that
the
beating
is
administered
as
a
compliment
and
in
order
to
benefit
the
health
of
the
victim
for
the
service
which
they
thus
render
the
damsels
they
are
rewarded
by
them
with
cakes
brandy
or
money
early
in
the
morning
of
new
year
s
day
the
lasses
pay
off
the
lads
in
the
same
kind
a
similar
custom
is
also
observed
in
central
and
germany
especially
in
voigtland
thus
in
voigtland
and
the
whole
of
the
saxon
the
lads
beat
the
lasses
and
women
on
the
second
day
of
the
christmas
holidays
with
something
green
such
as
rosemary
or
juniper
and
if
possible
the
beating
is
inflicted
on
the
women
as
they
lie
in
bed
as
they
beat
them
the
lads
say
and
green
pretty
and
fine
and
the
last
words
refer
to
the
present
of
gingerbread
and
brandy
which
the
lads
expect
to
receive
from
the
lasses
for
the
trouble
of
thrashing
them
next
day
the
lasses
and
women
retaliate
on
the
lads
and
men
in
thüringen
on
holy
innocents
day
the
of
december
children
armed
with
rods
and
green
boughs
go
about
the
streets
beating
and
demanding
a
present
in
return
they
even
make
their
way
into
the
houses
and
beat
the
in
orlagau
the
custom
is
called
whipping
with
fresh
on
the
second
day
of
the
christmas
holidays
the
girls
go
to
their
parents
godparents
relations
and
friends
and
beat
them
with
fresh
green
branches
of
fir
next
day
the
boys
and
lads
do
the
same
the
words
spoken
while
the
beating
is
being
administered
are
good
morning
fresh
green
long
life
you
must
give
us
a
bright
thaler
and
so
on
in
these
european
customs
the
intention
of
beating
persons
especially
of
the
other
sex
with
fresh
green
leaves
appears
unquestionably
to
be
the
beneficent
one
of
renewing
their
life
and
vigour
whether
the
purpose
is
supposed
to
be
accomplished
directly
and
positively
by
imparting
the
vital
energy
of
the
fresh
green
to
the
persons
or
negatively
and
indirectly
by
dispelling
any
injurious
influences
such
as
the
machinations
of
witches
and
demons
by
which
the
persons
may
be
supposed
to
be
beset
the
application
of
the
blows
by
the
one
sex
to
the
other
especially
by
young
men
to
young
women
suggests
that
the
beating
is
or
was
originally
intended
above
all
to
stimulate
the
reproductive
powers
of
the
men
or
women
who
received
it
and
the
pains
taken
to
ensure
that
the
branches
with
which
the
strokes
are
given
should
have
budded
or
blossomed
out
just
before
their
services
are
wanted
speak
strongly
in
favour
of
the
view
that
in
these
customs
we
have
a
deliberate
attempt
to
transfuse
a
store
of
vital
energy
from
the
vegetable
to
the
animal
world
these
analogies
accordingly
support
the
interpretation
which
following
my
predecessors
mannhardt
and
paton
i
have
given
of
the
beating
inflicted
on
the
human
victims
at
the
greek
harvest
festival
of
the
thargelia
that
beating
being
administered
to
the
generative
organs
of
the
victims
by
fresh
green
plants
and
branches
is
most
naturally
explained
as
a
charm
to
increase
the
reproductive
energies
of
the
men
or
women
either
by
communicating
to
them
the
fruitfulness
of
the
plants
and
branches
or
by
ridding
them
of
maleficent
influences
and
this
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
the
two
victims
represented
the
two
sexes
one
of
them
standing
for
the
men
in
general
and
the
other
for
the
women
the
season
of
the
year
when
the
ceremony
was
performed
namely
the
time
of
the
corn
harvest
tallies
well
with
the
theory
that
the
rite
had
an
agricultural
significance
further
that
it
was
above
all
intended
to
fertilize
the
is
strongly
suggested
by
the
strings
of
black
and
white
figs
which
were
hung
round
the
necks
of
the
victims
as
well
as
by
the
blows
which
were
given
their
genital
organs
with
the
branches
of
a
wild
since
this
procedure
closely
resembles
the
procedure
which
ancient
and
modern
husbandmen
in
greek
lands
have
regularly
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
actually
fertilizing
their
when
we
remember
what
an
important
part
the
artificial
fertilization
of
the
date
appears
to
have
played
of
old
not
only
in
the
husbandry
but
in
the
religion
of
mesopotamia
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
artificial
fertilization
of
the
may
in
like
manner
have
vindicated
for
itself
a
place
in
the
solemn
ritual
of
greek
religion
if
these
considerations
are
just
we
must
apparently
conclude
that
while
the
human
victims
at
the
thargelia
certainly
appear
in
later
classical
times
to
have
figured
chiefly
as
public
scapegoats
who
carried
away
with
them
the
sins
misfortunes
and
sorrows
of
the
whole
people
at
an
earlier
time
they
may
have
been
looked
on
as
embodiments
of
vegetation
perhaps
of
the
corn
but
particularly
of
the
and
that
the
beating
which
they
received
and
the
death
which
they
died
were
intended
primarily
to
brace
and
refresh
the
powers
of
vegetation
then
beginning
to
droop
and
languish
under
the
torrid
heat
of
the
greek
summer
the
view
here
taken
of
the
greek
scapegoat
if
it
is
correct
obviates
an
objection
which
might
otherwise
be
brought
against
the
main
argument
of
this
book
to
the
theory
that
the
priest
of
aricia
was
slain
as
a
representative
of
the
spirit
of
the
grove
it
might
have
been
objected
that
such
a
custom
has
no
analogy
in
classical
antiquity
but
reasons
have
now
been
given
for
believing
that
the
human
being
periodically
and
occasionally
slain
by
the
asiatic
greeks
was
regularly
treated
as
an
embodiment
of
a
divinity
of
vegetation
probably
the
persons
whom
the
athenians
kept
to
be
sacrificed
were
similarly
treated
as
divine
that
they
were
social
outcasts
did
not
matter
on
the
primitive
view
a
man
is
not
chosen
to
be
the
or
embodiment
of
a
god
on
account
of
his
high
moral
qualities
or
social
rank
the
divine
afflatus
descends
equally
on
the
good
and
the
bad
the
lofty
and
the
lowly
if
then
the
civilized
greeks
of
asia
and
athens
habitually
sacrificed
men
whom
they
regarded
as
incarnate
gods
there
can
be
no
inherent
improbability
in
the
supposition
that
at
the
dawn
of
history
a
similar
custom
was
observed

killing
the
god
in
mexico
by
no
people
does
the
custom
of
sacrificing
the
human
representative
of
a
god
appear
to
have
been
observed
so
commonly
and
with
so
much
solemnity
as
by
the
aztecs
of
ancient
mexico
with
the
ritual
of
these
remarkable
sacrifices
we
are
well
acquainted
for
it
has
been
fully
described
by
the
spaniards
who
conquered
mexico
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
whose
curiosity
was
naturally
excited
by
the
discovery
in
this
distant
region
of
a
barbarous
and
cruel
religion
which
presented
many
curious
points
of
analogy
to
the
doctrine
and
ritual
of
their
own
church
they
took
a
captive
says
the
jesuit
acosta
such
as
they
thought
good
and
afore
they
did
sacrifice
him
unto
their
idols
they
gave
him
the
name
of
the
idol
to
whom
he
should
be
sacrificed
and
apparelled
him
with
the
same
ornaments
like
their
idol
saying
that
he
did
represent
the
same
idol
and
during
the
time
that
this
representation
lasted
which
was
for
a
year
in
some
feasts
in
others
six
months
and
in
others
less
they
reverenced
and
worshipped
him
in
the
same
manner
as
the
proper
idol
and
in
the
meantime
he
did
eat
drink
and
was
merry
when
he
went
through
the
streets
the
people
came
forth
to
worship
him
and
every
one
brought
him
an
alms
with
children
and
sick
folks
that
he
might
cure
them
and
bless
them
suffering
him
to
do
all
things
at
his
pleasure
only
he
was
accompanied
with
ten
or
twelve
men
lest
he
should
fly
and
he
to
the
end
he
might
be
reverenced
as
he
passed
sometimes
sounded
upon
a
small
flute
that
the
people
might
prepare
to
worship
him
the
feast
being
come
and
he
grown
fat
they
killed
him
opened
him
and
ate
him
making
a
solemn
sacrifice
of
this
general
description
of
the
custom
may
now
be
illustrated
by
particular
examples
thus
at
the
festival
called
toxcatl
the
greatest
festival
of
the
mexican
year
a
young
man
was
annually
sacrificed
in
the
character
of
tezcatlipoca
the
god
of
gods
after
having
been
maintained
and
worshipped
as
that
great
deity
in
person
for
a
whole
year
according
to
the
old
franciscan
monk
sahagun
our
best
authority
on
the
aztec
religion
the
sacrifice
of
the
human
god
fell
at
easter
or
a
few
days
later
so
that
if
he
is
right
it
would
correspond
in
date
as
well
as
in
character
to
the
christian
festival
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
redeemer
more
exactly
he
tells
us
that
the
sacrifice
took
place
on
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
aztec
month
which
according
to
him
began
on
the
or
day
of
april
however
according
to
other
spanish
authorities
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
festival
lasted
from
the
ninth
to
the
nineteenth
day
of
may
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
human
victim
in
the
character
of
the
god
was
performed
on
the
last
of
these
days
an
eminent
modern
authority
professor
seler
is
of
opinion
that
the
festival
originally
celebrated
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
that
it
fell
on
the
day
when
the
sun
on
his
passage
northward
to
the
tropic
of
cancer
stood
in
the
zenith
over
the
city
of
mexico
which
in
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
would
be
the
ninth
or
tenth
day
of
may
old
style
or
the
nineteenth
or
twentieth
day
of
may
new
style
whatever
the
exact
date
of
the
celebration
may
have
been
we
are
told
that
the
feast
was
not
made
to
any
other
end
but
to
demand
rain
in
the
same
manner
that
we
solemnize
the
rogations
and
this
feast
was
always
in
may
which
is
the
time
that
they
have
most
need
of
rain
in
those
at
this
festival
the
great
god
died
in
the
person
of
one
human
representative
and
came
to
life
again
in
the
person
of
another
who
was
destined
to
enjoy
the
fatal
honour
of
divinity
for
a
year
and
to
perish
like
all
his
predecessors
at
the
end
of
it
the
young
man
singled
out
for
this
high
dignity
was
carefully
chosen
from
among
the
captives
on
the
ground
of
his
personal
beauty
he
had
to
be
of
unblemished
body
slim
as
a
reed
and
straight
as
a
pillar
neither
too
tall
nor
too
short
if
through
high
living
he
grew
too
fat
he
was
obliged
to
reduce
himself
by
drinking
salt
water
and
in
order
that
he
might
behave
in
his
lofty
station
with
becoming
grace
and
dignity
he
was
carefully
trained
to
comport
himself
like
a
gentleman
of
the
first
quality
to
speak
correctly
and
elegantly
to
play
the
flute
to
smoke
cigars
and
to
snuff
at
flowers
with
a
dandified
air
he
was
honourably
lodged
in
the
temple
where
the
nobles
waited
on
him
and
paid
him
homage
bringing
him
meat
and
serving
like
a
prince
the
king
himself
saw
to
it
that
he
was
apparelled
in
gorgeous
attire
for
already
he
esteemed
him
as
a
eagle
down
was
gummed
to
his
head
and
white
cock
s
feathers
were
stuck
in
his
hair
which
drooped
to
his
girdle
a
wreath
of
flowers
like
roasted
maize
crowned
his
brows
and
a
garland
of
the
same
flowers
passed
over
his
shoulders
and
under
his
golden
ornaments
hung
from
his
nose
golden
armlets
adorned
his
arms
golden
bells
jingled
on
his
legs
at
every
step
he
took
earrings
of
turquoise
dangled
from
his
ears
bracelets
of
turquoise
bedecked
his
wrists
necklaces
of
shells
encircled
his
neck
and
depended
on
his
breast
he
wore
a
mantle
of
network
and
round
his
middle
a
rich
when
this
bejewelled
exquisite
lounged
through
the
streets
playing
on
his
flute
puffing
at
a
cigar
and
smelling
at
a
nosegay
the
people
whom
he
met
threw
themselves
on
the
earth
before
him
and
prayed
to
him
with
sighs
and
tears
taking
up
the
dust
in
their
hands
and
putting
it
in
their
mouths
in
token
of
the
deepest
humiliation
and
subjection
women
came
forth
with
children
in
their
arms
and
presented
them
to
him
saluting
him
as
a
god
for
he
passed
for
our
lord
god
the
people
acknowledged
him
as
the
all
who
thus
worshipped
him
on
his
passage
he
saluted
gravely
and
courteously
lest
he
should
flee
he
was
everywhere
attended
by
a
guard
of
eight
pages
in
the
royal
livery
four
of
them
with
shaven
crowns
like
the
and
four
of
them
with
the
flowing
locks
of
warriors
and
if
he
contrived
to
escape
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
to
take
his
place
as
the
representative
of
the
god
and
to
die
in
his
stead
twenty
days
before
he
was
to
die
his
costume
was
changed
and
four
damsels
delicately
nurtured
and
bearing
the
names
of
four
goddess
of
flowers
the
goddess
of
the
young
maize
the
goddess
our
mother
among
the
water
and
the
goddess
of
given
him
to
be
his
brides
and
with
them
he
consorted
during
the
last
five
days
divine
honours
were
showered
on
the
destined
victim
the
king
remained
in
his
palace
while
the
whole
court
went
after
the
human
god
solemn
banquets
and
dances
followed
each
other
in
regular
succession
and
at
appointed
places
on
the
last
day
the
young
man
attended
by
his
wives
and
pages
embarked
in
a
canoe
covered
with
a
royal
canopy
and
was
ferried
across
the
lake
to
a
spot
where
a
little
hill
rose
from
the
edge
of
the
water
it
was
called
the
mountain
of
parting
because
here
his
wives
bade
him
a
last
farewell
then
accompanied
only
by
his
pages
he
repaired
to
a
small
and
lonely
temple
by
the
wayside
like
the
mexican
temples
in
general
it
was
built
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
and
as
the
young
man
ascended
the
stairs
he
broke
at
every
step
one
of
the
flutes
on
which
he
had
played
in
the
days
of
his
glory
on
reaching
the
summit
he
was
seized
and
held
down
by
the
priests
on
his
back
upon
a
block
of
stone
while
one
of
them
cut
open
his
breast
thrust
his
hand
into
the
wound
and
wrenching
out
his
heart
held
it
up
in
sacrifice
to
the
sun
the
body
of
the
dead
god
was
not
like
the
bodies
of
common
victims
sent
rolling
down
the
steps
of
the
temple
but
was
carried
down
to
the
foot
where
the
head
was
cut
off
and
spitted
on
a
pike
such
was
the
regular
end
of
the
man
who
personated
the
greatest
god
of
the
mexican
pantheon
but
he
was
not
the
only
man
who
played
the
part
of
a
god
and
was
sacrificed
as
such
in
the
month
of
may
the
great
god
vitzilopochtli
or
huitzilopochtli
was
also
worshipped
at
the
same
season
an
image
of
him
was
made
out
of
dough
in
human
shape
arrayed
in
all
the
ornaments
of
the
deity
and
set
up
in
his
temple
but
the
god
had
also
his
living
representative
in
the
person
of
a
young
man
who
like
the
human
representative
of
tezcatlipoca
personated
the
divinity
for
a
whole
year
and
was
sacrificed
at
the
end
in
the
month
of
may
it
was
the
duty
of
the
divine
man
destined
so
soon
to
die
to
lead
the
dances
which
formed
a
conspicuous
feature
of
the
festivities
courtiers
and
warriors
old
and
young
danced
in
winding
figures
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
and
with
them
danced
young
women
who
had
taken
a
vow
to
dance
with
roasted
maize
on
their
heads
these
damsels
wore
crowns
of
roasted
maize
festoons
of
maize
hung
from
their
shoulders
and
crossed
on
their
breasts
their
faces
were
painted
and
their
arms
and
legs
were
covered
with
red
feathers
dancing
in
this
attire
the
damsels
were
said
to
hold
the
god
vitzilopochtli
in
their
arms
but
they
conducted
themselves
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
decorum
if
any
man
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
toy
with
one
of
the
maidens
the
elder
warriors
dealt
with
him
promptly
and
severely
reproaching
him
for
the
sacrilege
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
sahagun
compares
these
may
dances
to
the
dances
of
peasant
men
and
women
in
old
castile
and
the
crowns
of
maize
worn
by
the
girls
he
compares
to
the
garlands
of
flowers
worn
by
rustic
castilian
maidens
in
the
month
of
may
so
they
danced
till
nightfall
next
morning
they
danced
again
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
man
who
represented
the
god
vitzilopochtli
was
put
to
death
he
had
the
privilege
of
choosing
the
hour
when
he
was
to
die
when
the
fatal
moment
drew
near
they
clothed
him
in
a
curious
dress
of
paper
painted
all
over
with
black
circles
on
his
head
they
clapped
a
paper
mitre
decked
with
eagle
feathers
and
nodding
plumes
among
which
was
fastened
a
obsidian
knife
thus
attired
with
golden
bells
jingling
at
his
ankles
he
led
the
dance
at
all
the
balls
of
the
festival
and
thus
attired
he
went
to
his
death
the
priests
seized
him
stretched
him
out
gripped
him
tight
cut
out
his
heart
and
held
it
up
to
the
sun
his
head
was
severed
from
the
trunk
and
spiked
beside
the
head
of
the
other
human
god
who
had
been
sacrificed
not
long
before
in
cholula
a
wealthy
trading
city
of
mexico
the
merchants
worshipped
a
god
named
quetzalcoatl
his
image
set
upon
a
richly
decorated
altar
or
pedestal
in
a
spacious
temple
had
the
body
of
a
man
but
the
head
of
a
bird
with
a
red
beak
surmounted
by
a
crest
the
face
dyed
yellow
with
a
black
band
running
from
the
eyes
to
below
the
beak
and
the
tongue
lolling
out
on
its
head
was
a
paper
mitre
painted
black
white
and
red
on
its
neck
a
large
golden
jewel
in
the
shape
of
butterfly
wings
about
its
body
a
feather
mantle
black
red
and
white
golden
socks
and
golden
sandals
encased
its
legs
and
feet
in
the
right
hand
the
image
wielded
a
wooden
instrument
like
a
sickle
and
in
the
left
a
buckler
covered
with
the
black
and
white
plumage
of
the
festival
of
this
god
was
celebrated
on
the
third
day
of
february
forty
days
before
the
festival
the
merchants
bought
a
slave
well
proportioned
without
any
fault
or
blemish
either
of
sickness
or
of
hurt
whom
they
did
attire
with
the
ornaments
of
the
idol
that
he
might
represent
it
forty
days
before
his
clothing
they
did
cleanse
him
washing
him
twice
in
a
lake
which
they
called
the
lake
of
the
gods
and
being
purified
they
attired
him
like
the
idol
during
these
forty
days
he
was
much
respected
for
his
sake
whom
he
represented
by
night
they
did
imprison
him
as
hath
been
said
lest
he
should
fly
and
in
the
morning
they
took
him
out
of
prison
setting
him
upon
an
eminent
place
where
they
served
him
giving
him
exquisite
meats
to
eat
after
he
had
eaten
they
put
a
chain
of
flowers
about
his
neck
and
many
nosegays
in
his
hands
he
had
a
guard
with
much
people
to
accompany
him
when
he
went
through
the
city
he
went
dancing
and
singing
through
all
the
streets
that
he
might
be
known
for
the
resemblance
of
their
god
and
when
he
began
to
sing
the
women
and
little
children
came
forth
of
their
houses
to
salute
him
and
to
offer
unto
him
as
to
their
god
two
old
men
of
the
ancients
of
the
temple
came
unto
him
nine
days
before
the
feast
and
humbling
themselves
before
him
they
said
with
a
low
and
submissive
voice
sir
you
must
understand
that
nine
days
hence
the
exercise
of
dancing
and
singing
doth
end
and
thou
must
then
die
and
then
he
must
answer
in
a
good
they
call
this
ceremony
maxilt
which
is
to
say
the
advertisement
and
when
they
did
thus
advertise
him
they
took
very
careful
heed
whether
he
were
sad
or
if
he
danced
as
joyfully
as
he
was
accustomed
the
which
if
he
did
not
as
cheerfully
as
they
desired
they
made
a
foolish
superstition
in
this
manner
they
presently
took
the
sacrifizing
razors
the
which
they
washed
and
cleansed
from
the
blood
of
men
which
remained
of
the
former
sacrifices
of
this
washing
they
made
a
drink
mingled
with
another
liquor
made
of
cacao
giving
it
him
to
drink
they
said
that
this
would
make
him
forget
what
had
been
said
unto
him
and
would
make
him
in
a
manner
insensible
returning
to
his
former
dancing
and
mirth
they
said
moreover
that
he
would
offer
himself
cheerfully
to
death
being
enchanted
with
this
drink
the
cause
why
they
sought
to
take
from
him
this
heaviness
was
for
that
they
held
it
for
an
ill
augury
and
a
of
some
great
harm
the
day
of
the
feast
being
come
after
they
had
done
him
much
honour
sung
and
given
him
incense
the
sacrificers
took
him
about
midnight
and
did
sacrifice
him
as
hath
been
said
offering
his
heart
unto
the
moon
the
which
they
did
afterwards
cast
against
the
idol
letting
the
body
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
of
the
temple
where
such
as
had
offered
him
took
him
up
which
were
the
merchants
whose
feast
it
was
then
having
carried
him
into
the
chiefest
man
s
house
amongst
them
the
body
was
drest
with
diverse
sauces
to
celebrate
at
the
break
of
day
the
banquet
and
dinner
of
the
feast
having
first
bid
the
idol
good
morrow
with
a
small
dance
which
they
made
whilst
the
day
did
break
and
that
they
prepared
the
sacrifice
then
did
all
the
merchants
assemble
at
this
banquet
especially
those
which
made
it
a
trafick
to
buy
and
sell
slaves
who
were
bound
every
year
to
offer
one
for
the
resemblance
of
their
god
this
idol
was
one
of
the
most
honoured
in
all
the
land
and
therefore
the
temple
where
he
was
was
of
great
the
honour
of
living
for
a
short
time
in
the
character
of
a
god
and
dying
a
violent
death
in
the
same
capacity
was
not
restricted
to
men
in
mexico
women
were
allowed
or
rather
compelled
to
enjoy
the
glory
and
to
share
the
doom
as
representatives
of
goddesses
thus
in
the
seventh
month
of
their
year
which
corresponded
roughly
to
june
the
aztecs
celebrated
a
festival
in
honour
of
huixtocihuatl
the
goddess
of
salt
she
was
said
to
be
a
sister
of
the
rain
gods
but
having
quarrelled
with
them
she
was
banished
and
driven
to
take
up
her
abode
in
the
salt
water
being
of
an
ingenious
turn
of
mind
she
invented
the
process
of
extracting
salt
by
means
of
pans
hence
she
was
worshipped
by
all
as
their
patron
goddess
her
garments
were
yellow
on
her
head
she
wore
a
mitre
surmounted
by
bunches
of
waving
green
plumes
which
shone
with
greenish
iridescent
hues
in
the
sun
her
robe
and
petticoats
were
embroidered
with
patterns
simulating
the
waves
of
the
sea
golden
in
the
form
of
flowers
dangled
at
her
ears
golden
bells
jingled
at
her
ankles
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
round
shield
painted
with
the
leaves
of
a
certain
plant
and
adorned
with
drooping
fringes
of
parrots
feathers
in
the
other
hand
she
carried
a
stout
baton
ending
in
a
knob
and
bedecked
with
paper
artificial
flowers
and
feathers
for
ten
days
before
her
festival
a
woman
personated
the
goddess
and
wore
her
gorgeous
costume
it
was
her
duty
during
these
days
to
lead
the
dances
which
at
this
season
were
danced
by
the
women
and
girls
of
the
they
danced
young
old
and
children
in
a
ring
all
holding
a
cord
their
heads
crowned
with
garlands
of
a
fragrant
flower
and
singing
airs
in
a
shrill
soprano
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
danced
the
woman
who
represented
the
goddess
with
her
golden
bells
jingling
at
every
step
brandishing
her
shield
and
marking
the
time
of
the
dance
and
song
with
her
baton
on
the
last
day
the
eve
of
the
festival
she
had
to
dance
all
night
without
resting
till
break
of
day
when
she
was
to
die
old
women
supported
her
in
the
weary
task
and
they
all
danced
together
arm
in
arm
with
her
too
danced
the
slaves
who
were
to
die
with
her
in
the
morning
when
the
hour
was
come
they
led
her
still
personating
the
goddess
up
the
steps
of
the
temple
of
tlaloc
followed
by
the
doomed
captives
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
pyramid
the
butchery
began
with
the
captives
while
the
woman
stood
looking
on
her
turn
being
come
they
threw
her
on
her
back
on
the
block
and
while
five
men
held
her
down
and
two
others
compressed
her
throat
with
a
billet
of
wood
or
the
sword
of
a
to
prevent
her
from
screaming
the
priest
cut
open
her
breast
with
his
knife
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
wound
tore
out
her
heart
and
flung
it
into
a
bowl
when
all
was
over
the
who
had
witnessed
the
sacrifice
went
home
to
drink
and
make
merry
again
in
the
eighth
month
of
the
mexican
year
which
answered
to
the
latter
end
of
june
and
the
early
part
of
july
the
aztecs
sacrificed
a
woman
who
personated
xilonen
the
goddess
of
the
young
the
festival
at
which
the
sacrifice
took
place
was
held
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
about
the
time
when
the
maize
is
nearly
ripe
and
when
fibres
shooting
forth
from
the
green
ear
shew
that
the
grain
is
fully
formed
for
eight
days
before
the
festival
men
and
women
clad
in
rich
garments
and
decked
with
jewels
danced
and
sang
together
in
the
courts
of
the
temples
which
were
brilliantly
illuminated
for
the
purpose
rows
of
tall
braziers
sent
up
a
flickering
blaze
and
torchbearers
held
aloft
huge
torches
of
pinewood
some
of
the
dancers
themselves
carried
heavy
torches
which
flared
and
spluttered
as
they
danced
the
dances
began
at
sundown
and
lasted
till
about
nine
o
clock

but
tried
and
distinguished
warriors
might
take
part
in
them
the
women
wore
their
long
hair
hanging
loose
on
their
back
and
shoulders
in
order
that
the
tassels
of
the
maize
might
likewise
grow
long
and
loose
for
the
more
tassels
the
more
grain
in
the
ear

with
their
arms
round
each
other
s
waists
marking
time
exactly
with
their
feet
to
the
music
of
the
drums
and
moving
out
and
in
among
the
flaming
braziers
and
torches
the
dances
were
strictly
decorous
if
any
man
was
detected
making
love
to
one
of
the
women
dancers
he
was
publicly
disgraced
severely
punished
and
never

the
rich
robes
and
splendid
jewels
of
the
divinity
whom
she
personated
the
upper
part
of
her
face
was
painted
red
and
the
lower
part
yellow
probably
to
assimilate
her
to
the
ruddy
and
orange
hues
of
the
ripe
maize

legs
and
arms
were
covered
with
red
feathers

arrayed

was
led
by
other
women
to
offer
incense
in
four
different
places
all
the
rest
of
the
night
she
and
they
danced
and
sang
in
front
of
the
temple
of
the
goddess
xilonen
whose
living
image
she
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
morning
the
nobles
danced
a
solemn
dance
by
themselves
leaning
or
making
believe
to
lean
on
stalks
of
maize
the
women
pranked
with
garlands
and
festoons
of
yellow
flowers
danced
also
by
themselves
along
with
the
victim
among
the
priests
the
one
who
was
to
act
as
executioner
wore
a
fine
bunch
of
feathers
on
his
back
another
shook
a
rattle
before
the
doomed
woman
as
she
mounted
up
the
steps
of
the
temple
of
cinteotl
the
goddess
of
the
maize
on
reaching
the
summit
she
was
seized
by
a
priest
who
threw
her
on
his
back
while
the
sacrificer
severed
her
head
from
her
body
tore
out
her
heart
and
threw
it
in
a
saucer
when
this
sacrifice
had
been
performed
in
honour
of
xilonen
the
goddess
of
the
young
maize
the
people
were
free
to
eat
the
green
ears
of
maize
and
the
bread
that
was
baked
of
it
no
one
would
have
dared
to
eat
of
these
things
before
the
sacrifice
again
in
the
seventeenth
month
of
the
mexican
year
which
corresponded
to
the
latter
part
of
december
and
the
early
part
of
january
the
aztecs
sacrificed
a
woman
who
personated
the
goddess
ilamatecutli
or
tonan
which
means
our
her
festival
fell
on
christmas
day
the
of
december
the
image
of
the
goddess
wore
a
mask
with
large
mouths
and
protruding
eyes
the
woman
who
represented
her
was
dressed
in
white
robes
and
shod
with
white
sandals
over
her
white
mantle
she
wore
a
leathern
jerkin
the
lower
edge
of
which
was
cut
into
a
fringe
of
straps
and
to
the
end
of
each
strap
was
fastened
a
small
shell
as
she
walked
the
shells
clashed
together
and
made
a
noise
which
was
heard
afar
off
the
upper
half
of
her
face
was
painted
yellow
and
the
lower
half
black
and
she
wore
a
wig
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
round
whitewashed
shield
decorated
in
the
middle
with
a
circle
of
eagle
feathers
while
white
heron
plumes
ending
in
eagle
feathers
drooped
from
it
thus
arrayed
and
personating
the
goddess
the
woman
danced
alone
to
music
played
by
old
men
and
as
she
danced
she
sighed
and
wept
at
the
thought
of
the
death
that
was
so
near
at
noon
or
a
little
later
the
dance
ceased
and
when
the
sun
was
declining
in
the
west
they
led
her
up
the
long
ascent
to
the
summit
of
huitzilopochtli
s
temple
behind
her
marched
the
priests
clad
in
the
trappings
of
all
the
gods
with
masks
on
their
faces
one
of
them
wore
the
costume
and
the
mask
of
the
goddess
ilamatecutli
whom
the
victim
also
represented
on
reaching
the
lofty
platform
which
crowned
the
pyramidal
temple
they
slew
her
in
the
usual
fashion
wrenched
out
her
heart
and
cut
off
her
head
the
dripping
head
was
given
to
the
priest
who
wore
the
costume
and
mask
of
the
goddess
and
waving
it
up
and
down
he
danced
round
the
platform
followed
by
all
the
other
priests
in
the
attire
and
masks
of
the
gods
when
the
dance
had
lasted
a
certain
time
the
leader
gave
the
signal
and
they
all
trooped
down
the
long
flight
of
stairs
to
disrobe
themselves
and
deposit
the
masks
and
costumes
in
the
chapels
where
they
were
usually
kept
next
day
the
people
indulged
in
a
certain
pastime
men
and
boys
furnished
themselves
with
little
bags
or
nets
stuffed
with
paper
flowers
of
galingale
or
green
leaves
of
maize
which
they
tied
to
strings
and
used
them
as
instruments
to
strike
any
girl
or
woman
they
might
meet
in
the
streets
sometimes
three
or
four
urchins
would
gather
round
one
girl
beating
her
till
she
cried
but
some
shrewd
wenches
went
about
that
day
armed
with
sticks
with
which
they
retaliated
smartly
on
their
assailants
it
was
a
penal
offence
to
put
stones
or
anything
else
that
could
hurt
in
the
bags
in
the
preceding
custom
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
sacrifice
of
a
woman
who
personated
the
goddess
by
a
man
who
also
wore
the
costume
and
mask
of
the
goddess
and
who
immediately
after
the
sacrifice
danced
with
the
bleeding
head
of
the
victim
perhaps
the
intention
of
the
strange
rite
was
to
represent
the
resurrection
of
the
slain
goddess
in
the
person
of
the
priest
who
wore
her
costume
and
mask
and
dangled
the
severed
head
of
her
slaughtered
representative
if
that
was
so
it
would
explain
another
and
still
ghastlier
rite
in
which
the
mexicans
seem
to
have
set
forth
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
resurrection
this
was
to
skin
the
slain
woman
who
had
personated
the
goddess
and
then
to
clothe
in
the
bloody
skin
a
man
who
pranced
about
in
it
as
if
he
were
the
dead
woman
or
rather
goddess
come
to
life
again
thus
in
the
eleventh
mexican
month
which
corresponded
to
the
latter
part
of
august
and
the
early
part
of
september
they
celebrated
a
festival
in
honour
of
a
goddess
called
the
mother
of
the
gods
or
our
ancestress
or
the
heart
of
the
earth
and
they
sacrificed
a
woman
clad
in
the
costume
and
ornaments
of
the
goddess
she
was
a
slave
bought
for
the
purpose
by
the
guilds
of
physicians
surgeons
midwives
and
who
particularly
worshipped
this
deity
when
the
poor
wretch
came
forth
decked
in
all
the
trappings
of
the
goddess
the
people
we
are
told
looked
on
her
as
equivalent
to
the
mother
of
the
gods
herself
and
paid
her
as
much
honour
and
reverence
as
if
she
had
indeed
been
that
great
divinity
for
eight
days
they
danced
silently
in
four
rows
if
dance
it
could
be
called
in
which
the
dancers
scarcely
stirred
their
legs
and
bodies
but
contented
themselves
with
moving
their
hands
in
which
they
held
branches
of
blossoms
up
and
down
in
time
to
the
tuck
of
drum
these
dances
began
in
the
afternoon
and
lasted
till
the
sun
went
down
no
one
might
speak
during
their
performance
only
some
lively
youths
mimicked
by
a
booming
murmur
of
the
lips
the
of
the
drums
when
the
dances
were
over
the
medical
women
young
and
old
divided
themselves
into
two
parties
and
engaged
in
a
sham
fight
before
the
woman
who
acted
the
part
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
this
they
did
to
divert
her
and
keep
her
from
being
sad
and
shedding
tears
for
if
she
wept
they
deemed
it
an
omen
that
many
men
would
die
in
battle
and
many
women
in
childbed
the
fight
between
the
women
consisted
in
throwing
balls
of
moss
leaves
or
flowers
at
each
other
and
she
who
personated
the
goddess
led
one
of
the
parties
to
the
attack
these
mock
battles
lasted
four
days
after
that
they
led
the
woman
who
was
to
die
to
the
that
she
might
bid
it
farewell
and
by
way
of
doing
so
she
scattered
the
flour
of
maize
wherever
she
went
the
priests
then
attended
her
to
a
building
near
the
temple
in
which
she
was
to
be
sacrificed
the
knowledge
of
her
doom
was
kept
from
her
as
far
as
possible
the
medical
women
and
the
midwives
comforted
her
saying
be
not
cast
down
sweetheart
this
night
thou
shalt
sleep
with
the
king
therefore
then
they
put
on
her
the
ornaments
of
the
goddess
and
at
midnight
led
her
to
the
temple
where
she
was
to
die
on
the
passage
not
a
word
was
spoken
not
a
cough
was
heard
crowds
were
gathered
to
see
her
pass
but
all
kept
a
profound
silence
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
temple
she
was
hoisted
on
to
the
back
of
one
priest
while
another
adroitly
cut
off
her
head
the
body
still
warm
was
skinned
and
a
tall
robust
young
man
clothed
himself
in
the
bleeding
skin
and
so
became
in
turn
a
living
image
of
the
goddess
one
of
the
woman
s
thighs
was
flayed
separately
and
the
skin
carried
to
another
temple
where
a
young
man
put
it
over
his
face
as
a
mask
and
so
personated
the
cinteotl
daughter
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
meantime
the
other
clad
in
the
rest
of
the
woman
s
skin
hurried
down
the
steps
of
the
temple
the
nobles
and
warriors
fled
before
him
carrying
besoms
of
couchgrass
but
turned
to
look
back
at
him
from
time
to
time
and
smote
upon
their
shields
as
if
to
bid
him
come
on
he
followed
hard
after
them
and
all
who
saw
that
flight
and
pursuit
quaked
with
fear
on
arriving
at
the
foot
of
the
temple
of
huitzilopochtli
the
man
who
wore
the
skin
of
the
dead
woman
and
personated
the
mother
of
the
gods
lifted
up
his
arms
and
stood
like
a
cross
before
the
image
of
the
god
this
action
he
repeated
four
times
then
he
joined
the
man
who
personated
the
cinteotl
and
together
they
went
slowly
to
the
temple
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
where
the
woman
had
been
sacrificed
all
this
time
it
was
night
next
morning
at
break
of
day
the
man
who
personated
the
mother
of
the
gods
took
up
his
post
on
the
highest
point
of
the
temple
there
they
decked
him
in
all
the
gorgeous
trappings
of
the
goddess
and
set
a
splendid
crown
on
his
head
then
the
captives
were
set
in
a
row
before
him
and
arrayed
in
all
his
finery
he
slaughtered
four
of
them
with
his
own
hand
the
rest
he
left
to
be
butchered
by
the
priests
a
variety
of
ceremonies
and
dances
followed
amongst
others
the
blood
of
the
human
victims
was
collected
in
a
bowl
and
set
before
the
man
who
personated
the
mother
of
the
gods
he
dipped
his
finger
into
the
blood
and
then
sucked
his
bloody
finger
and
when
he
had
sucked
it
he
bowed
his
head
and
uttered
a
dolorous
groan
whereat
the
indians
believed
the
earth
itself
shook
and
trembled
as
did
all
who
heard
it
finally
the
skin
of
the
slain
woman
and
the
skin
of
her
thigh
were
carried
away
and
deposited
separately
at
two
towers
one
of
which
stood
on
the
border
of
the
enemy
s
country
this
remarkable
festival
in
honour
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
is
said
to
have
been
immediately
preceded
by
a
similar
festival
in
honour
of
the
maize
goddess
chicomecohuatl
the
image
of
this
goddess
was
of
wood
and
represented
her
as
a
girl
of
about
twelve
years
of
age
wearing
feminine
ornaments
painted
in
gay
colours
on
her
head
was
a
pasteboard
mitre
her
long
hair
fell
on
her
shoulders
in
her
ears
she
had
golden
earrings
round
her
neck
she
wore
a
necklace
of
golden
strung
on
a
blue
ribbon
and
in
her
hands
she
held
the
likeness
of
made
of
feathers
and
garnished
with
gold
her
festival
which
was
observed
throughout
the
whole
country
with
great
devotion
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
september
was
preceded
by
a
strict
fast
of
seven
days
during
which
old
and
young
sick
and
whole
ate
nothing
but
broken
victuals
and
dry
bread
and
drank
nothing
but
water
and
did
penance
by
drawing
blood
from
their
ears
the
blood
so
drawn
was
kept
in
vessels
which
were
not
scoured
so
that
a
dry
crust
formed
over
it
on
the
day
before
the
fast
began
the
people
ate
and
drank
to
their
heart
s
content
and
they
sanctified
a
woman
to
represent
atlatatonan
the
goddess
of
lepers
dressing
her
up
in
an
appropriate
costume
when
the
fast
was
over
the
high
priest
of
the
temple
of
tlaloc
sacrificed
the
woman
in
the
usual
way
by
tearing
out
her
heart
and
holding
it
up
as
an
offering
to
the
sun
her
body
with
all
the
robes
and
ornaments
she
had
worn
was
cast
into
a
well
or
vault
in
the
temple
and
along
with
the
corpse
were
thrown
in
all
the
plates
and
dishes
out
of
which
the
people
had
eaten
and
all
the
mats
on
which
they
had
sat
or
slept
during
the
fast
as
if
says
the
historian
they
had
been
infected
with
the
plague
of
leprosy
after
that
the
people
were
free
to
eat
bread
salt
and
tomatoes
and
immediately
after
the
sacrifice
of
the
woman
who
personated
the
goddess
of
leprosy
they
sanctified
a
young
slave
girl
of
twelve
or
thirteen
years
the
prettiest
they
could
find
to
represent
the
maize
goddess
chicomecohuatl
they
invested
her
with
the
ornaments
of
the
goddess
putting
the
mitre
on
her
head
and
the
round
her
neck
and
in
her
hands
and
fastening
a
green
feather
upright
on
the
crown
of
her
head
to
imitate
an
ear
of
maize
this
they
did
we
are
told
in
order
to
signify
that
the
maize
was
almost
ripe
at
the
time
of
the
festival
but
because
it
was
still
tender
they
chose
a
girl
of
tender
years
to
play
the
part
of
the
maize
goddess
the
whole
long
day
they
led
the
poor
child
in
all
her
finery
with
the
green
plume
nodding
on
her
head
from
house
to
house
dancing
merrily
to
cheer
people
after
the
dulness
and
privations
of
the
fast
in
the
evening
all
the
people
assembled
at
the
temple
the
courts
of
which
they
lit
up
by
a
multitude
of
lanterns
and
candles
there
they
passed
the
night
without
sleeping
and
at
midnight
while
the
trumpets
flutes
and
horns
discoursed
solemn
music
a
portable
framework
or
palanquin
was
brought
forth
bedecked
with
festoons
of
and
peppers
and
filled
with
seeds
of
all
sorts
this
the
bearers
set
down
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
in
which
the
wooden
image
of
the
goddess
stood
now
the
chamber
was
adorned
and
wreathed
both
outside
and
inside
with
wreaths
of
peppers
pumpkins
roses
and
seeds
of
every
kind
a
wonder
to
behold
the
whole
floor
was
covered
deep
with
these
verdant
offerings
of
the
pious
when
the
music
ceased
a
solemn
procession
came
forth
of
priests
and
dignitaries
with
flaring
lights
and
smoking
censers
leading
in
their
midst
the
girl
who
played
the
part
of
the
goddess
then
they
made
her
mount
the
framework
where
she
stood
upright
on
the
maize
and
peppers
and
pumpkins
with
which
it
was
strewed
her
hands
resting
on
two
bannisters
to
keep
her
from
falling
then
the
priests
swung
the
smoking
censers
round
her
the
music
struck
up
again
and
while
it
played
a
great
dignitary
of
the
temple
suddenly
stepped
up
to
her
with
a
razor
in
his
hand
and
adroitly
shore
off
the
green
feather
she
wore
on
her
head
together
with
the
hair
in
which
it
was
fastened
snipping
the
lock
off
by
the
root
the
feather
and
the
hair
he
then
presented
to
the
wooden
image
of
the
goddess
with
great
solemnity
and
elaborate
ceremonies
weeping
and
giving
her
thanks
for
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
abundant
crops
which
she
had
bestowed
on
the
people
that
year
and
as
he
wept
and
prayed
all
the
people
standing
in
the
courts
of
the
temple
wept
and
prayed
with
him
when
that
ceremony
was
over
the
girl
descended
from
the
framework
and
was
escorted
to
the
place
where
she
was
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
but
all
the
people
kept
watch
in
the
courts
of
the
temple
by
the
light
of
torches
till
break
of
day
the
morning
being
come
and
the
courts
of
the
temple
being
still
crowded
by
the
multitude
who
would
have
deemed
it
sacrilege
to
quit
the
precincts
the
priests
again
brought
forth
the
damsel
attired
in
the
costume
of
the
goddess
with
the
mitre
on
her
head
and
the
cobs
of
maize
about
her
neck
again
she
mounted
the
portable
framework
or
palanquin
and
stood
on
it
supporting
herself
by
her
hands
on
the
bannisters
then
the
elders
of
the
temple
lifted
it
on
their
shoulders
and
while
some
swung
burning
censers
and
others
played
on
instruments
or
sang
they
carried
it
in
procession
through
the
great
courtyard
to
the
hall
of
the
god
huitzilopochtli
and
then
back
to
the
chamber
where
stood
the
wooden
image
of
the
maize
goddess
whom
the
girl
personated
there
they
caused
the
damsel
to
descend
from
the
palanquin
and
to
stand
on
the
heaps
of
corn
and
vegetables
that
had
been
spread
in
profusion
on
the
floor
of
the
sacred
chamber
while
she
stood
there
all
the
elders
and
nobles
came
in
a
line
one
behind
the
other
carrying
the
saucers
of
dry
and
clotted
blood
which
they
had
drawn
from
their
ears
by
way
of
penance
during
the
seven
days
fast
one
by
one
they
squatted
on
their
haunches
before
her
which
was
the
equivalent
of
falling
on
their
knees
with
us
and
scraping
the
crust
of
blood
from
the
saucer
cast
it
down
before
her
as
an
offering
in
return
for
the
benefits
which
she
as
the
embodiment
of
the
maize
goddess
had
conferred
upon
them
when
the
men
had
thus
humbly
offered
their
blood
to
the
human
representative
of
the
goddess
the
women
forming
a
long
line
did
so
likewise
each
of
them
dropping
on
her
hams
before
the
girl
and
scraping
her
blood
from
the
saucer
the
ceremony
lasted
a
long
time
for
great
and
small
young
and
old
all
without
exception
had
to
pass
before
the
incarnate
deity
and
make
their
offering
when
it
was
over
the
people
returned
home
with
glad
hearts
to
feast
on
flesh
and
viands
of
every
sort
as
merrily
we
are
told
as
good
christians
at
easter
partake
of
meat
and
other
carnal
mercies
after
the
long
abstinence
of
lent
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
their
fill
and
rested
after
the
night
watch
they
returned
quite
refreshed
to
the
temple
to
see
the
end
of
the
festival
and
the
end
of
the
festival
was
this
the
multitude
being
assembled
the
priests
solemnly
incensed
the
girl
who
personated
the
goddess
then
they
threw
her
on
her
back
on
the
heap
of
corn
and
seeds
cut
off
her
head
caught
the
gushing
blood
in
a
tub
and
sprinkled
the
blood
on
the
wooden
image
of
the
goddess
the
walls
of
the
chamber
and
the
offerings
of
corn
peppers
pumpkins
seeds
and
vegetables
which
cumbered
the
floor
after
that
they
flayed
the
headless
trunk
and
one
of
the
priests
made
shift
to
squeeze
himself
into
the
bloody
skin
having
done
so
they
clad
him
in
all
the
robes
which
the
girl
had
worn
they
put
the
mitre
on
his
head
the
necklace
of
golden
about
his
neck
the
of
feathers
and
gold
in
his
hands
and
thus
arrayed
they
led
him
forth
in
public
all
of
them
dancing
to
the
tuck
of
drum
while
he
acted
as
fugleman
skipping
and
posturing
at
the
head
of
the
procession
as
briskly
as
he
could
be
expected
to
do
incommoded
as
he
was
by
the
tight
and
clammy
skin
of
the
girl
and
by
her
clothes
which
must
have
been
much
too
small
for
a
grown
man
in
the
foregoing
custom
the
identification
of
the
young
girl
with
the
maize
goddess
appears
to
be
complete
the
golden
maize
cobs
which
she
wore
round
her
neck
the
artificial
maize
cobs
which
she
carried
in
her
hands
the
green
feather
which
was
stuck
in
her
hair
in
imitation
we
are
told
of
a
green
ear
of
maize
all
set
her
forth
as
a
personification
of
the
and
we
are
expressly
informed
that
she
was
specially
chosen
as
a
young
girl
to
represent
the
young
maize
which
at
the
time
of
the
festival
had
not
yet
fully
ripened
further
her
identification
with
the
corn
and
the
was
clearly
announced
by
making
her
stand
on
the
heaps
of
maize
and
there
receive
the
homage
and
of
the
whole
people
who
thereby
returned
her
thanks
for
the
benefits
which
in
her
character
of
a
divinity
she
was
supposed
to
have
conferred
upon
them
once
more
the
practice
of
beheading
her
on
a
heap
of
corn
and
seeds
and
sprinkling
her
blood
not
only
on
the
image
of
the
maize
goddess
but
on
the
piles
of
maize
peppers
pumpkins
seeds
and
vegetables
can
seemingly
have
had
no
other
object
but
to
quicken
and
strengthen
the
crops
of
corn
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
general
by
infusing
into
their
representatives
the
blood
of
the
corn
goddess
herself
the
analogy
of
this
mexican
sacrifice
the
meaning
of
which
appears
to
be
indisputable
may
be
allowed
to
strengthen
the
interpretation
which
i
have
given
of
other
human
sacrifices
offered
for
the
crops
if
the
mexican
girl
whose
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
maize
indeed
personated
the
maize
goddess
it
becomes
more
than
ever
probable
that
the
girl
whose
blood
the
pawnees
similarly
sprinkled
on
the
seed
corn
personated
in
like
manner
the
female
spirit
of
the
corn
and
so
with
the
other
human
beings
whom
other
races
have
slaughtered
for
the
sake
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
crops
lastly
the
concluding
act
of
the
sacred
drama
in
which
the
body
of
the
dead
maize
goddess
was
flayed
and
her
skin
worn
together
with
all
her
sacred
insignia
by
a
man
who
danced
before
the
people
in
this
grim
attire
seems
to
be
best
explained
on
the
hypothesis
that
it
was
intended
to
ensure
that
the
divine
death
should
be
immediately
followed
by
the
divine
resurrection
if
that
was
so
we
may
infer
with
some
degree
of
probability
that
the
practice
of
killing
a
human
representative
of
a
deity
has
commonly
perhaps
always
been
regarded
merely
as
a
means
of
perpetuating
the
divine
energies
in
the
fulness
of
youthful
vigour
untainted
by
the
weakness
and
frailty
of
age
from
which
they
must
have
suffered
if
the
deity
had
been
allowed
to
die
a
natural
death
this
interpretation
of
the
mexican
custom
of
flaying
human
beings
and
permitting
or
requiring
other
persons
to
parade
publicly
in
the
skins
of
the
victims
may
perhaps
be
confirmed
by
a
consideration
of
the
festival
at
which
this
strange
rite
was
observed
on
the
largest
scale
and
which
accordingly
went
by
the
name
of
the
festival
of
the
flaying
of
men
it
was
celebrated
in
the
second
month
of
the
aztec
year
which
corresponded
to
the
last
days
of
february
and
the
early
part
of
march
the
exact
day
of
the
festival
was
the
twentieth
of
march
according
to
one
pious
chronicler
who
notes
with
unction
that
the
bloody
rite
fell
only
one
day
later
than
the
feast
which
holy
church
solemnizes
in
honour
of
the
glorious
joseph
the
god
whom
the
aztecs
worshipped
in
this
strange
fashion
was
named
xipe
the
flayed
one
or
totec
our
on
this
occasion
he
also
bore
the
solemn
name
of
youallauan
he
who
drinks
in
the
his
image
was
of
stone
and
represented
him
in
human
form
with
his
mouth
open
as
if
in
the
act
of
speaking
his
body
was
painted
yellow
on
the
one
side
and
drab
on
the
other
he
wore
the
skin
of
a
flayed
man
over
his
own
with
the
hands
of
the
victim
dangling
at
his
wrists
on
his
head
he
had
a
hood
of
various
colours
and
about
his
loins
a
green
petticoat
reaching
to
his
knees
with
a
fringe
of
small
shells
in
his
two
hands
he
grasped
a
rattle
like
the
head
of
a
poppy
with
the
seeds
in
it
while
on
his
left
arm
he
supported
a
yellow
shield
with
a
red
rim
at
his
festival
the
mexicans
killed
all
the
prisoners
they
had
taken
in
war
men
women
and
children
the
number
of
the
victims
was
very
great
a
spanish
historian
of
the
sixteenth
century
estimated
that
in
mexico
more
people
used
to
be
sacrificed
on
the
altar
than
died
a
natural
death
all
who
were
sacrificed
to
xipe
the
flayed
god
were
themselves
flayed
and
men
who
had
made
a
special
vow
to
the
god
put
on
the
skins
of
the
human
victims
and
went
about
the
city
in
that
guise
for
twenty
days
being
everywhere
welcomed
and
revered
as
living
images
of
the
deity
forty
days
before
the
festival
according
to
the
historian
duran
they
chose
a
man
to
personate
the
god
clothed
him
in
all
the
insignia
of
the
divinity
and
led
him
about
in
public
doing
him
as
much
reverence
all
these
days
as
if
he
had
really
been
what
he
pretended
to
be
moreover
every
parish
of
the
capital
did
the
same
each
of
them
had
its
own
temple
and
appointed
its
own
human
representative
of
the
deity
who
received
the
homage
and
worship
of
the
parishioners
for
the
forty
days
on
the
day
of
the
festival
these
mortal
gods
and
all
the
other
prisoners
with
the
exception
of
a
few
who
were
reserved
for
a
different
death
were
killed
in
the
usual
way
the
scene
of
the
slaughter
was
the
platform
on
the
summit
of
the
god
huitzilopochtli
s
temple
some
of
the
poor
wretches
fainted
when
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
had
to
be
dragged
up
the
long
staircase
by
the
hair
of
their
heads
arrived
at
the
summit
they
were
slaughtered
one
by
one
on
the
sacrificial
stone
by
the
high
priest
who
cut
open
their
breasts
tore
out
their
hearts
and
held
them
up
to
the
sun
in
order
to
feed
the
great
luminary
with
these
bleeding
relics
then
the
bodies
were
sent
rolling
down
the
staircase
clattering
and
turning
over
and
over
like
gourds
as
they
bumped
from
step
to
step
till
they
reached
the
bottom
there
they
were
received
by
other
priests
or
rather
human
butchers
who
with
a
dexterity
acquired
by
practice
slit
the
back
of
each
body
from
the
nape
of
the
neck
to
the
heels
and
peeled
off
the
whole
skin
in
a
single
piece
as
neatly
as
if
it
had
been
a
sheepskin
the
skinless
body
was
then
fetched
away
by
its
owner
that
is
by
the
man
who
had
captured
the
prisoner
in
war
he
took
it
home
with
him
carved
it
sent
one
of
the
thighs
to
the
king
and
other
joints
to
friends
or
invited
them
to
come
and
feast
on
the
carcase
in
his
house
the
skins
of
the
human
victims
were
also
a
perquisite
of
their
captors
and
were
lent
or
hired
out
by
them
to
men
who
had
made
a
vow
of
going
about
clad
in
the
hides
for
twenty
days
such
men
clothed
in
the
reeking
skins
of
the
butchered
prisoners
were
called
xixipeme
or
tototectin
after
the
god
xipe
or
totec
whose
living
image
they
were
esteemed
and
whose
costume
they
wore
among
the
devotees
who
bound
themselves
to
this
pious
exercise
were
persons
who
suffered
from
loathsome
skin
diseases
such
as
smallpox
abscesses
and
the
itch
and
among
them
there
was
a
fair
sprinkling
of
debauchees
who
had
drunk
themselves
nearly
blind
and
hoped
to
recover
the
use
of
their
precious
eyes
by
parading
for
a
month
in
this
curious
mantle
thus
arrayed
they
went
from
house
to
house
throughout
the
city
entering
everywhere
and
asking
alms
for
the
love
of
god
on
entering
a
house
each
of
these
reverend
palmers
was
made
to
sit
on
a
heap
of
leaves
festoons
of
maize
and
wreaths
of
flowers
were
placed
round
his
body
and
he
was
given
wine
to
drink
and
cakes
to
eat
and
when
a
mother
saw
one
of
these
filthy
but
sanctified
ruffians
passing
along
the
street
she
would
run
to
him
with
her
infant
and
put
it
in
his
arms
that
he
might
bless
it
which
he
did
with
unction
receiving
an
alms
from
the
happy
mother
in
return
the
earnings
of
these
on
their
rounds
were
sometimes
considerable
for
the
rich
people
rewarded
them
handsomely
whatever
they
were
the
collectors
paid
them
in
to
the
owners
of
the
skins
who
thus
made
a
profit
by
hiring
out
these
valuable
articles
of
property
every
night
the
wearers
of
the
skins
deposited
them
in
the
temple
and
fetched
them
again
next
morning
when
they
set
out
on
their
rounds
at
the
end
of
the
twenty
days
the
skins
were
dry
hard
shrivelled
and
shrunken
and
they
smelt
so
villainously
that
people
held
their
noses
when
they
met
the
holy
beggars
arrayed
in
their
fetid
mantles
the
time
being
come
to
rid
themselves
of
these
encumbrances
the
devotees
walked
in
solemn
procession
wearing
the
rotten
skins
and
stinking
like
dead
dogs
to
the
temple
called
yopico
where
they
stripped
themselves
of
the
hides
and
plunged
them
into
a
tub
or
vat
after
which
they
washed
and
scrubbed
themselves
thoroughly
while
their
friends
smacked
their
bare
bodies
loudly
with
wet
hands
in
order
to
squeeze
out
the
human
grease
with
which
they
were
saturated
finally
the
skins
were
solemnly
buried
as
holy
relics
in
a
vault
of
the
temple
the
burial
service
was
accompanied
by
chanting
and
attended
by
the
whole
people
and
when
it
was
over
one
of
the
high
dignitaries
preached
a
sermon
to
the
assembled
congregation
in
which
he
dwelt
with
pathetic
eloquence
on
the
meanness
and
misery
of
human
existence
and
exhorted
his
hearers
to
lead
a
sober
and
quiet
life
to
cultivate
the
virtues
of
reverence
modesty
humility
and
obedience
to
be
kind
and
charitable
to
the
poor
and
to
strangers
he
warned
them
against
the
sins
of
robbery
fornication
adultery
and
covetousness
and
kindling
with
the
glow
of
his
oratory
he
passionately
admonished
entreated
and
implored
all
who
heard
him
to
choose
the
good
and
shun
the
evil
drawing
a
dreadful
picture
of
the
ills
that
would
overtake
the
wicked
here
and
hereafter
while
he
painted
in
alluring
colours
the
bliss
in
store
for
the
righteous
and
the
rewards
they
might
expect
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
deity
in
the
life
to
come
while
most
of
the
men
who
masqueraded
in
the
skins
of
the
human
victims
appear
to
have
personated
the
flayed
god
xipe
whose
name
they
bore
in
the
form
xixipeme
others
assumed
the
ornaments
and
bore
the
names
of
other
mexican
deities
such
as
huitzilopochtli
and
quetzalcoatl
the
ceremony
of
investing
them
with
the
skins
and
the
insignia
of
divinity
was
called
which
means
to
think
themselves
amongst
the
gods
thus
personated
was
totec
his
human
representative
wore
over
the
skin
of
the
flayed
man
all
the
splendid
trappings
of
the
deity
on
his
head
was
placed
a
curious
crown
decorated
with
rich
feathers
a
golden
crescent
dangled
from
his
nose
golden
earrings
from
his
ears
and
a
necklace
of
hammered
gold
encircled
his
neck
his
feet
were
shod
in
red
shoes
decorated
with
quail
s
feathers
his
loins
were
begirt
with
a
petticoat
of
gorgeous
plumage
and
on
his
back
three
small
paper
flags
fluttered
and
rustled
in
the
wind
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
golden
shield
and
in
his
right
a
rattle
which
he
shook
and
rattled
as
he
walked
with
a
majestic
dancing
step
seats
were
always
prepared
for
this
human
god
and
when
he
sat
down
they
offered
him
a
paste
made
of
uncooked
also
they
presented
to
him
little
bunches
of
cobs
of
maize
chosen
from
the
and
he
received
as
offerings
the
first
fruits
and
the
first
flowers
of
the
season
in
the
eighteenth
and
last
month
of
their
year
which
fell
in
january
the
mexicans
held
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
god
of
fire
every
fourth
year
the
festival
was
celebrated
on
a
grand
scale
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
great
many
men
and
women
husbands
and
wives
who
were
dressed
in
the
trappings
of
the
and
regarded
as
his
living
images
bound
hand
and
foot
they
were
thrown
alive
into
a
great
furnace
and
after
roasting
in
it
for
a
little
were
raked
out
of
the
fire
before
they
were
dead
in
order
to
allow
the
priest
to
cut
the
hearts
out
of
their
scorched
blistered
and
still
writhing
bodies
in
the
usual
way
the
intention
of
the
sacrifice
probably
was
to
maintain
the
in
full
vigour
lest
he
should
grow
decrepit
or
even
die
of
old
age
and
mankind
should
thus
be
deprived
of
his
valuable
services
this
important
object
was
attained
by
feeding
the
fire
with
live
men
and
women
who
thus
as
it
were
poured
a
fresh
stock
of
vital
energy
into
the
veins
of
the
and
perhaps
of
his
wife
also
but
they
had
to
be
raked
out
of
the
flames
before
they
were
dead
for
clearly
it
would
never
do
to
let
them
die
in
the
fire
else
the
whom
they
personated
would
die
also
for
the
same
reason
their
hearts
had
to
be
torn
from
their
bodies
while
they
were
still
palpitating
what
use
could
the
make
of
human
hearts
that
were
burnt
to
cinders
this
was
the
ordinary
mode
of
sacrificing
the
human
representatives
of
the
every
fourth
year
but
in
quauhtitlan
a
city
distant
four
leagues
from
the
city
of
mexico
the
custom
was
different
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
two
women
were
beheaded
on
the
altar
of
the
temple
and
afterwards
flayed
faces
and
all
and
their
thigh
bones
extracted
next
morning
two
men
of
high
rank
clothed
themselves
in
the
skins
including
the
skins
of
the
women
s
faces
which
they
put
over
their
own
and
thus
arrayed
and
carrying
in
their
hands
the
thigh
bones
of
the
victims
they
came
down
the
steps
of
the
temple
roaring
like
wild
beasts
a
vast
crowd
of
people
had
assembled
to
witness
the
spectacle
and
when
they
saw
the
two
men
coming
down
the
steps
in
the
dripping
skins
brandishing
the
bones
and
bellowing
like
beasts
they
were
filled
with
fear
and
said
there
come
our
gods
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
these
human
gods
engaged
in
a
dance
which
they
kept
up
for
the
rest
of
the
day
never
divesting
themselves
of
the
bloody
skins
till
the
festival
was
over
the
theory
that
the
custom
of
wearing
the
skin
of
a
flayed
man
or
woman
and
personating
a
god
in
that
costume
is
intended
to
represent
the
resurrection
of
the
deity
derives
some
support
from
the
class
of
persons
who
made
a
vow
to
masquerade
in
the
skins
they
were
as
we
have
seen
especially
men
who
suffered
from
diseases
of
the
skin
and
the
eyes
they
hoped
we
are
told
by
wearing
the
skins
to
be
cured
of
their
ailments
and
the
old
spanish
monk
who
records
the
belief
adds
dryly
that
some
were
cured
and
some
were
not
we
may
conjecture
that
by
donning
the
skins
of
men
who
had
acted
the
part
of
gods
they
expected
to
slough
off
their
own
diseased
old
skins
and
to
acquire
new
and
healthy
skins
like
those
of
the
deities
this
notion
may
have
been
suggested
to
them
by
the
observation
of
certain
animals
such
as
serpents
and
lizards
which
seem
to
renew
their
youth
by
casting
their
skins
and
appear
refreshed
and
renovated
in
new
integuments
that
many
savages
have
noticed
such
transformations
in
the
animal
world
is
proved
by
the
tales
which
some
of
them
tell
to
account
for
the
origin
of
death
among
mankind
for
example
the
arawaks
of
british
guiana
say
that
man
was
created
by
a
good
being
whom
they
call
kururumany
once
on
a
time
this
kindly
creator
came
to
earth
to
see
how
his
creature
man
was
getting
on
but
men
were
so
ungrateful
that
they
tried
to
kill
their
maker
hence
he
took
from
them
the
gift
of
immortality
and
bestowed
it
upon
animals
that
change
their
skins
such
as
snakes
lizards
and
beetles
again
the
tamanachiers
an
indian
tribe
of
the
orinoco
tell
how
the
creator
kindly
intended
to
make
men
immortal
by
telling
them
that
they
should
change
their
skins
he
meant
to
say
that
by
so
doing
they
should
renew
their
youth
like
serpents
and
beetles
but
the
glad
tidings
were
received
with
such
incredulity
by
an
old
woman
that
the
creator
in
a
huff
changed
his
tune
and
said
very
curtly
ye
shall
in
annam
they
say
that
ngoc
hoang
sent
a
messenger
from
heaven
to
inform
men
that
when
they
reached
old
age
they
should
change
their
skins
and
live
for
ever
but
that
when
serpents
grew
old
they
must
die
unfortunately
for
the
human
race
the
message
was
perverted
in
the
transmission
so
that
men
do
not
change
their
skins
and
are
therefore
mortal
whereas
serpents
do
cast
their
old
skins
and
accordingly
live
for
ever
according
to
the
natives
of
nias
the
personage
who
was
charged
by
the
creator
with
the
duty
of
putting
the
last
touches
to
man
broke
his
fast
on
bananas
instead
of
on
as
he
should
have
done
for
had
he
only
eaten
men
would
have
changed
their
skins
like
crabs
and
like
crabs
would
have
never
died
but
the
serpents
wiser
in
their
generation
than
men
ate
the
crabs
and
that
is
why
they
too
are
immortal
stories
of
the
same
sort
are
current
among
the
melanesians
thus
the
natives
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
account
for
the
origin
of
death
by
a
tale
very
like
that
told
in
annam
the
good
spirit
they
say
loved
men
and
wished
to
make
them
immortal
but
he
hated
serpents
and
wished
to
kill
them
so
he
despatched
his
brother
to
mankind
with
this
cheering
message
go
to
men
and
take
them
the
secret
of
immortality
tell
them
to
cast
their
skin
every
year
so
will
they
be
protected
from
death
for
their
life
will
be
constantly
renewed
but
tell
the
serpents
that
they
must
henceforth
through
the
carelessness
or
treachery
of
the
messenger
this
message
was
reversed
so
that
now
as
we
all
know
men
die
and
serpents
live
for
ever
by
annually
casting
their
skins
again
if
we
can
trust
the
traditions
of
the
banks
islanders
and
new
hebrideans
there
was
a
time
when
men
did
really
cast
their
skins
and
renew
their
youth
the
melancholy
change
to
mortality
was
brought
about
by
an
old
woman
who
most
unfortunately
resumed
her
old
skin
to
please
an
infant
which
squalled
at
seeing
her
in
her
new
integument
the
gallas
of
east
africa
say
that
god
sent
a
certain
bird
the
sheep
of
god
to
tell
men
that
they
would
not
die
but
that
when
they
grew
old
they
would
slough
their
skins
and
so
renew
their
youth
but
the
bird
foolishly
or
maliciously
delivered
the
message
to
serpents
instead
of
to
men
and
that
is
why
ever
since
men
have
been
mortal
and
serpents
immortal
for
that
evil
deed
god
punished
the
bird
with
a
painful
malady
from
which
it
suffers
to
this
day
and
it
sits
on
the
tops
of
trees
and
moans
and
wails
perpetually
thus
it
appears
that
some
peoples
have
not
only
observed
the
curious
transformations
which
certain
animals
undergo
but
have
imagined
that
by
means
of
such
transformations
the
animals
periodically
renew
their
youth
and
live
for
ever
from
such
observations
and
fancies
it
is
an
easy
step
to
the
conclusion
that
man
might
similarly
take
a
fresh
lease
of
life
and
renew
the
lease
indefinitely
if
only
he
could
contrive
like
the
animals
to
get
a
new
skin
this
desirable
object
the
mexicans
apparently
sought
to
accomplish
by
flaying
men
and
wearing
their
bleeding
skins
like
garments
thrown
over
their
own
by
so
doing
persons
who
suffered
from
cutaneous
diseases
hoped
to
acquire
a
new
and
healthy
skin
and
by
so
doing
the
priests
attempted
not
merely
to
revive
the
gods
whom
they
had
just
slain
in
the
persons
of
their
human
representatives
but
also
to
restore
to
their
wasting
and
decaying
frames
all
the
vigour
and
energy
of
youth
the
rites
described
in
the
preceding
pages
suffice
to
prove
that
human
sacrifices
of
the
sort
i
suppose
to
have
prevailed
at
aricia
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
systematically
offered
on
a
large
scale
by
a
people
whose
level
of
culture
was
probably
not
inferior
if
indeed
it
was
not
distinctly
superior
to
that
occupied
by
the
italian
races
at
the
early
period
to
which
the
origin
of
the
arician
priesthood
must
be
referred
the
positive
and
indubitable
evidence
of
the
prevalence
of
such
sacrifices
in
one
part
of
the
world
may
reasonably
be
allowed
to
strengthen
the
probability
of
their
prevalence
in
places
for
which
the
evidence
is
less
full
and
trustworthy
taken
all
together
the
facts
which
we
have
passed
in
review
seem
to
shew
that
the
custom
of
killing
men
whom
their
worshippers
regard
as
divine
has
prevailed
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
to
clinch
the
argument
it
is
clearly
desirable
to
prove
that
the
custom
of
putting
to
death
a
human
representative
of
a
god
was
known
and
practised
in
ancient
italy
elsewhere
than
in
the
arician
grove
this
proof
i
now
propose
to
adduce
chapter
viii
the
saturnalia
and
kindred
festivals
the
roman
saturnalia
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
book
we
saw
that
many
peoples
have
been
used
to
observe
an
annual
period
of
license
when
the
customary
restraints
of
law
and
morality
are
thrown
aside
when
the
whole
population
give
themselves
up
to
extravagant
mirth
and
jollity
and
when
the
darker
passions
find
a
vent
which
would
never
be
allowed
them
in
the
more
staid
and
sober
course
of
ordinary
life
such
outbursts
of
the
forces
of
human
nature
too
often
degenerating
into
wild
orgies
of
lust
and
crime
occur
most
commonly
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
are
frequently
associated
as
i
have
had
occasion
to
point
out
with
one
or
other
of
the
agricultural
seasons
especially
with
the
time
of
sowing
or
of
harvest
now
of
all
these
periods
of
license
the
one
which
is
best
known
and
which
in
modern
languages
has
given
its
name
to
the
rest
is
the
saturnalia
this
famous
festival
fell
in
december
the
last
month
of
the
roman
year
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
commemorate
the
merry
reign
of
saturn
the
god
of
sowing
and
of
husbandry
who
lived
on
earth
long
ago
as
a
righteous
and
beneficent
king
of
italy
drew
the
rude
and
scattered
dwellers
on
the
mountains
together
taught
them
to
till
the
ground
gave
them
laws
and
ruled
in
peace
his
reign
was
the
fabled
golden
age
the
earth
brought
forth
abundantly
no
sound
of
war
or
discord
troubled
the
happy
world
no
baleful
love
of
lucre
worked
like
poison
in
the
blood
of
the
industrious
and
contented
peasantry
slavery
and
private
property
were
alike
unknown
all
men
had
all
things
in
common
at
last
the
good
god
the
kindly
king
vanished
suddenly
but
his
memory
was
cherished
to
distant
ages
shrines
were
reared
in
his
honour
and
many
hills
and
high
places
in
italy
bore
his
name
yet
the
bright
tradition
of
his
reign
was
crossed
by
a
dark
shadow
his
altars
are
said
to
have
been
stained
with
the
blood
of
human
victims
for
whom
a
more
merciful
age
afterwards
substituted
effigies
of
this
gloomy
side
of
the
god
s
religion
there
is
little
or
no
trace
in
the
descriptions
which
ancient
writers
have
left
us
of
the
saturnalia
feasting
and
revelry
and
all
the
mad
pursuit
of
pleasure
are
the
features
that
seem
to
have
especially
marked
this
carnival
of
antiquity
as
it
went
on
for
seven
days
in
the
streets
and
public
squares
and
houses
of
ancient
rome
from
the
seventeenth
to
the
of
december
but
no
feature
of
the
festival
is
more
remarkable
nothing
in
it
seems
to
have
struck
the
ancients
themselves
more
than
the
license
granted
to
slaves
at
this
time
the
distinction
between
the
free
and
the
servile
classes
was
temporarily
abolished
the
slave
might
rail
at
his
master
intoxicate
himself
like
his
betters
sit
down
at
table
with
them
and
not
even
a
word
of
reproof
would
be
administered
to
him
for
conduct
which
at
any
other
season
might
have
been
punished
with
stripes
imprisonment
or
death
nay
more
masters
actually
changed
places
with
their
slaves
and
waited
on
them
at
table
and
not
till
the
serf
had
done
eating
and
drinking
was
the
board
cleared
and
dinner
set
for
his
master
so
far
was
this
inversion
of
ranks
carried
that
each
household
became
for
a
time
a
mimic
republic
in
which
the
high
offices
of
state
were
discharged
by
the
slaves
who
gave
their
orders
and
laid
down
the
law
as
if
they
were
indeed
invested
with
all
the
dignity
of
the
consulship
the
praetorship
and
the
bench
like
the
pale
reflection
of
power
thus
accorded
to
bondsmen
at
the
saturnalia
was
the
mock
kingship
for
which
freemen
cast
lots
at
the
same
season
the
person
on
whom
the
lot
fell
enjoyed
the
title
of
king
and
issued
commands
of
a
playful
and
ludicrous
nature
to
his
temporary
subjects
one
of
them
he
might
order
to
mix
the
wine
another
to
drink
another
to
sing
another
to
dance
another
to
speak
in
his
own
dispraise
another
to
carry
a
on
his
back
round
the
house
now
when
we
remember
that
the
liberty
allowed
to
slaves
at
this
festive
season
was
supposed
to
be
an
imitation
of
the
state
of
society
in
saturn
s
time
and
that
in
general
the
saturnalia
passed
for
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
temporary
revival
or
restoration
of
the
reign
of
that
merry
monarch
we
are
tempted
to
surmise
that
the
mock
king
who
presided
over
the
revels
may
have
originally
represented
saturn
himself
the
conjecture
is
strongly
confirmed
if
not
established
by
a
very
curious
and
interesting
account
of
the
way
in
which
the
saturnalia
was
celebrated
by
the
roman
soldiers
stationed
on
the
danube
in
the
reign
of
maximian
and
diocletian
the
account
is
preserved
in
a
narrative
of
the
martyrdom
of
dasius
which
was
unearthed
from
a
greek
manuscript
in
the
paris
library
and
published
by
professor
franz
cumont
of
ghent
two
briefer
descriptions
of
the
event
and
of
the
custom
are
contained
in
manuscripts
at
milan
and
berlin
one
of
them
had
already
seen
the
light
in
an
obscure
volume
printed
at
urbino
in
but
its
importance
for
the
history
of
the
roman
religion
both
ancient
and
modern
appears
to
have
been
overlooked
until
professor
cumont
drew
the
attention
of
scholars
to
all
three
narratives
by
publishing
them
together
some
years
ago
according
to
these
narratives
which
have
all
the
appearance
of
being
authentic
and
of
which
the
longest
is
probably
based
on
official
documents
the
roman
soldiers
at
durostorum
in
lower
moesia
celebrated
the
saturnalia
year
by
year
in
the
following
manner
thirty
days
before
the
festival
they
chose
by
lot
from
amongst
themselves
a
young
and
handsome
man
who
was
then
clothed
in
royal
attire
to
resemble
saturn
thus
arrayed
and
attended
by
a
multitude
of
soldiers
he
went
about
in
public
with
full
license
to
indulge
his
passions
and
to
taste
of
every
pleasure
however
base
and
shameful
but
if
his
reign
was
merry
it
was
short
and
ended
tragically
for
when
the
thirty
days
were
up
and
the
festival
of
saturn
had
come
he
cut
his
own
throat
on
the
altar
of
the
god
whom
he
personated
in
the
year
the
lot
fell
upon
the
christian
soldier
dasius
but
he
refused
to
play
the
part
of
the
heathen
god
and
soil
his
last
days
by
debauchery
the
threats
and
arguments
of
his
commanding
officer
bassus
failed
to
shake
his
constancy
and
accordingly
he
was
beheaded
as
the
christian
martyrologist
records
with
minute
accuracy
at
durostorum
by
the
soldier
john
on
friday
the
twentieth
day
of
november
being
the
day
of
the
moon
at
the
fourth
hour
since
this
narrative
was
published
by
professor
cumont
its
historical
character
which
had
been
doubted
or
denied
has
received
strong
confirmation
from
an
interesting
discovery
in
the
crypt
of
the
cathedral
which
crowns
the
promontory
of
ancona
there
is
preserved
among
other
remarkable
antiquities
a
white
marble
sarcophagus
bearing
a
greek
inscription
in
characters
of
the
age
of
justinian
to
the
following
effect
here
lies
the
holy
martyr
dasius
brought
from
the
sarcophagus
was
transferred
to
the
crypt
of
the
cathedral
in
from
the
church
of
san
pellegrino
under
the
high
altar
of
which
as
we
learn
from
a
latin
inscription
let
into
the
masonry
the
martyr
s
bones
still
repose
with
those
of
two
other
saints
how
long
the
sarcophagus
was
deposited
in
the
church
of
san
pellegrino
we
do
not
know
but
it
is
recorded
to
have
been
there
in
the
year
we
may
suppose
that
the
saint
s
relics
were
transferred
for
safety
to
ancona
at
some
time
in
the
troubled
centuries
which
followed
his
martyrdom
when
moesia
was
occupied
and
ravaged
by
successive
hordes
of
barbarian
invaders
at
all
events
it
appears
certain
from
the
independent
and
mutually
confirmatory
evidence
of
the
martyrology
and
the
monuments
that
dasius
was
no
mythical
saint
but
a
real
man
who
suffered
death
for
his
faith
at
durostorum
in
one
of
the
early
centuries
of
the
christian
era
finding
the
narrative
of
the
nameless
martyrologist
thus
established
as
to
the
principal
fact
recorded
namely
the
martyrdom
of
dasius
we
may
reasonably
accept
his
testimony
as
to
the
manner
and
cause
of
the
martyrdom
all
the
more
because
his
narrative
is
precise
circumstantial
and
entirely
free
from
the
miraculous
element
accordingly
i
conclude
that
the
account
which
he
gives
of
the
celebration
of
the
saturnalia
among
the
roman
soldiers
is
trustworthy
this
account
sets
in
a
new
and
lurid
light
the
office
of
the
king
of
the
saturnalia
the
ancient
lord
of
misrule
who
presided
over
the
winter
revels
at
rome
in
the
time
of
horace
and
of
tacitus
it
seems
to
prove
that
his
business
had
not
always
been
that
of
a
mere
harlequin
or
whose
only
care
was
that
the
revelry
should
run
high
and
the
fun
grow
fast
and
furious
while
the
fire
blazed
and
crackled
on
the
hearth
while
the
streets
swarmed
with
festive
crowds
and
through
the
clear
frosty
air
far
away
to
the
north
soracte
shewed
his
coronal
of
snow
when
we
compare
this
comic
monarch
of
the
gay
the
civilized
metropolis
with
his
grim
counterpart
of
the
rude
camp
on
the
danube
and
when
we
remember
the
long
array
of
similar
figures
ludicrous
yet
tragic
who
in
other
ages
and
in
other
lands
wearing
mock
crowns
and
wrapped
in
sceptred
palls
have
played
their
little
pranks
for
a
few
brief
hours
or
days
then
passed
before
their
time
to
a
violent
death
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
in
the
king
of
the
saturnalia
at
rome
as
he
is
depicted
by
classical
writers
we
see
only
a
feeble
emasculated
copy
of
that
original
whose
strong
features
have
been
fortunately
preserved
for
us
by
the
obscure
author
of
the
of
in
other
words
the
martyrologist
s
account
of
the
saturnalia
agrees
so
closely
with
the
accounts
of
similar
rites
elsewhere
which
could
not
possibly
have
been
known
to
him
that
the
substantial
accuracy
of
his
description
may
be
regarded
as
established
and
further
since
the
custom
of
putting
a
mock
king
to
death
as
a
representative
of
a
god
can
not
have
grown
out
of
a
practice
of
appointing
him
to
preside
over
a
holiday
revel
whereas
the
reverse
may
very
well
have
happened
we
are
justified
in
assuming
that
in
an
earlier
and
more
barbarous
age
it
was
the
universal
practice
in
ancient
italy
wherever
the
worship
of
saturn
prevailed
to
choose
a
man
who
played
the
part
and
enjoyed
all
the
traditionary
privileges
of
saturn
for
a
season
and
then
died
whether
by
his
own
or
another
s
hand
whether
by
the
knife
or
the
fire
or
on
the
in
the
character
of
the
good
god
who
gave
his
life
for
the
world
in
rome
itself
and
other
great
towns
the
growth
of
civilization
had
probably
mitigated
this
cruel
custom
long
before
the
augustan
age
and
transformed
it
into
the
innocent
shape
it
wears
in
the
writings
of
the
few
classical
writers
who
bestow
a
passing
notice
on
the
holiday
king
of
the
saturnalia
but
in
remoter
districts
the
older
and
sterner
practice
may
long
have
survived
and
even
if
after
the
unification
of
italy
the
barbarous
usage
was
suppressed
by
the
roman
government
the
memory
of
it
would
be
handed
down
by
the
peasants
and
would
tend
from
time
to
time
as
still
happens
with
the
lowest
forms
of
superstition
among
ourselves
to
lead
to
a
recrudescence
of
the
practice
especially
among
the
rude
soldiery
on
the
outskirts
of
the
empire
over
whom
the
once
iron
hand
of
rome
was
beginning
to
relax
its
grasp
the
resemblance
between
the
saturnalia
of
ancient
and
the
carnival
of
modern
italy
has
often
been
remarked
but
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
that
have
come
before
us
we
may
well
ask
whether
the
resemblance
does
not
amount
to
identity
we
have
seen
that
in
italy
spain
and
france
that
is
in
the
countries
where
the
influence
of
rome
has
been
deepest
and
most
lasting
a
conspicuous
feature
of
the
carnival
is
a
burlesque
figure
personifying
the
festive
season
which
after
a
short
career
of
glory
and
dissipation
is
publicly
shot
burnt
or
otherwise
destroyed
to
the
feigned
grief
or
genuine
delight
of
the
populace
if
the
view
here
suggested
of
the
carnival
is
correct
this
grotesque
personage
is
no
other
than
a
direct
successor
of
the
old
king
of
the
saturnalia
the
master
of
the
revels
the
real
man
who
personated
saturn
and
when
the
revels
were
over
suffered
a
real
death
in
his
assumed
character
the
king
of
the
bean
on
twelfth
night
and
the
mediaeval
bishop
of
fools
abbot
of
unreason
or
lord
of
misrule
are
figures
of
the
same
sort
and
may
perhaps
have
had
a
similar
origin
we
will
consider
them
in
the
following
section
the
king
of
the
bean
and
the
festival
of
fools
the
custom
of
electing
by
lot
a
king
and
often
also
a
queen
of
the
bean
on
twelfth
night
epiphany
the
sixth
of
january
or
on
the
eve
of
that
festival
used
to
prevail
in
france
belgium
germany
and
england
and
it
is
still
kept
up
in
some
parts
of
france
it
may
be
traced
back
to
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
at
least
and
no
doubt
dates
from
a
very
much
more
remote
antiquity
at
the
french
court
the
kings
themselves
did
not
disdain
to
countenance
the
mock
royalty
and
louis
xiv
even
supported
with
courtly
grace
the
shadowy
dignity
in
his
own
person
every
family
as
a
rule
elected
its
own
king
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
a
great
cake
was
baked
with
a
bean
in
it
the
cake
was
divided
in
portions
one
for
each
member
of
the
family
together
with
one
for
god
one
for
the
virgin
and
sometimes
one
also
for
the
poor
the
person
who
obtained
the
portion
containing
the
bean
was
proclaimed
king
of
the
bean
where
a
queen
of
the
bean
was
elected
as
well
as
a
king
a
second
bean
was
sometimes
baked
in
the
cake
for
the
queen
thus
at
blankenheim
near
neuerburg
in
the
eifel
a
black
and
a
white
bean
were
baked
in
the
cake
he
who
drew
the
piece
with
the
black
bean
was
king
and
she
who
drew
the
white
bean
was
queen
in
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
used
to
put
as
many
white
haricot
beans
in
a
hat
as
there
were
persons
present
and
two
coloured
beans
were
added
the
beans
were
drawn
at
haphazard
from
the
hat
by
a
child
and
they
who
got
the
coloured
beans
were
king
and
queen
in
england
and
perhaps
elsewhere
the
practice
was
to
put
a
bean
in
the
cake
for
the
king
and
a
pea
for
the
queen
but
in
some
places
only
the
king
was
elected
by
lot
and
after
his
election
he
chose
his
queen
for
himself
sometimes
a
coin
was
substituted
for
the
bean
in
the
cake
but
though
this
usage
was
followed
in
southern
germany
as
early
as
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
is
probably
an
innovation
on
the
older
custom
of
employing
a
bean
as
the
lot
in
france
the
distribution
of
the
pieces
of
the
cake
among
the
persons
present
was
made
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
a
child
the
youngest
boy
present
who
was
placed
under
or
on
the
table
and
addressed
by
the
name
of
phoebe
or
tébé
he
answered
in
latin
the
master
of
the
house
holding
a
piece
of
the
cake
in
his
hand
asked
the
child
to
whom
he
should
give
it
and
the
child
named
any
person
he
pleased
sometimes
the
first
slice
of
cake
was
regularly
assigned
to
the
good
god
and
set
aside
for
the
poor
in
the
name
phoebe
or
tébé
by
which
the
child
was
addressed
learned
antiquaries
have
detected
a
reference
to
the
oracle
of
apollo
but
more
probably
the
name
is
a
simple
corruption
of
the
latin
or
french
word
for
bean
latin
french
immediately
on
his
election
the
king
of
the
bean
was
enthroned
saluted
by
all
and
thrice
lifted
up
while
he
made
crosses
with
chalk
on
the
beams
and
rafters
of
the
ceiling
great
virtue
was
attributed
to
these
white
crosses
they
were
supposed
to
protect
the
house
for
the
whole
year
against
injuryes
and
cursed
devils
sprites
and
bugges
of
conjurings
and
then
feasting
and
revelry
began
and
were
kept
up
merrily
without
respect
of
persons
every
time
the
king
or
queen
drank
the
whole
company
was
expected
to
cry
the
king
drinks
or
the
queen
drinks
any
person
who
failed
to
join
in
the
cry
was
punished
by
having
his
face
blackened
with
soot
or
a
burned
cork
or
smeared
with
the
lees
of
wine
in
some
parts
of
the
ardennes
the
custom
was
to
fasten
great
horns
of
paper
in
the
hair
of
the
delinquent
and
to
put
a
huge
pair
of
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
he
had
to
wear
these
badges
of
infamy
till
the
end
of
the
festival
the
custom
of
electing
a
king
and
queen
of
the
bean
on
twelfth
day
is
still
kept
up
all
over
the
north
of
france
a
miniature
porcelain
figure
of
a
child
is
sometimes
substituted
for
the
bean
in
the
cake
if
the
lot
whether
bean
or
doll
falls
to
a
boy
he
becomes
king
and
chooses
his
queen
if
it
falls
to
a
girl
she
becomes
queen
and
chooses
her
king
so
far
apart
from
the
crosses
chalked
up
to
ban
hobgoblins
witches
and
bugs
the
king
and
queen
of
the
bean
might
seem
to
be
merely
playful
personages
appointed
at
a
season
of
festivity
to
lead
the
revels
however
a
more
serious
significance
was
sometimes
attached
to
the
office
and
to
the
ceremonies
of
twelfth
day
in
general
thus
in
lorraine
the
height
of
the
hemp
crop
in
the
coming
year
was
prognosticated
from
the
height
of
the
king
and
queen
if
the
king
was
the
taller
of
the
two
it
was
supposed
that
the
male
hemp
would
be
higher
than
the
female
but
that
the
contrary
would
happen
if
the
queen
were
taller
than
the
king
again
in
the
vosges
mountains
on
the
borders
of
it
is
customary
on
twelfth
day
for
people
to
dance
on
the
roofs
in
order
to
make
the
hemp
grow
tall
further
in
many
places
the
beans
used
in
the
cake
were
carried
to
the
church
to
be
blessed
by
the
clergy
and
people
drew
omens
from
the
cake
as
to
the
good
or
ill
that
would
befall
them
throughout
the
year
moreover
certain
forms
of
divination
were
resorted
to
on
twelfth
night
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
in
which
month
of
the
year
wheat
would
be
dearest
in
particularly
in
the
montagne
du
doubs
it
is
still
the
custom
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
the
fifth
of
january
to
light
bonfires
which
appear
to
have
in
the
popular
mind
some
reference
to
the
crops
the
whole
population
takes
part
in
the
festivity
in
the
afternoon
the
young
folk
draw
a
cart
about
the
street
collecting
fuel
some
people
contribute
faggots
others
bundles
of
straw
or
of
dry
hemp
stalks
towards
evening
the
whole
of
the
fuel
thus
collected
is
piled
up
a
little
way
from
the
houses
and
set
on
fire
while
it
blazes
the
people
dance
round
it
crying
good
year
come
back
bread
and
wine
come
back
in
the
district
of
pontarlier
the
young
folk
carry
lighted
torches
about
the
fields
shaking
sparks
over
the
sowed
lands
and
shouting
couaille
blanconnie
of
which
the
meaning
has
been
forgotten
a
similar
custom
is
commonly
observed
on
the
same
day
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
the
fifth
of
january
in
the
bocage
of
normandy
except
that
it
is
the
rather
than
the
sowed
fields
to
which
the
fire
is
applied
when
the
evening
shadows
have
fallen
on
the
landscape
the
darkness
begins
to
be
illuminated
here
and
there
by
twinkling
points
of
fire
which
multiply
as
the
night
grows
late
till
they
appear
as
numerous
on
earth
as
the
stars
in
the
sky
about
every
village
in
the
fields
and
orchards
on
the
crests
of
the
hills
wandering
lights
may
be
discerned
vanishing
and
suddenly
reappearing
gathering
together
and
then
dispersing
pursuing
each
other
capriciously
and
tracing
broken
lines
sparkling
arabesques
of
fire
in
the
gloom
of
night
the
peasants
are
observing
the
ceremony
of
the
moles
and
et
and
that
evening
there
is
not
a
hamlet
not
a
farm
hardly
a
solitary
cottage
that
does
not
contribute
its
flame
to
the
general
illumination
till
the
whole
horizon
seems
in
a
blaze
and
houses
woods
and
hills
stand
out
in
dark
relief
against
the
glow
of
the
sky
the
villages
vie
with
each
other
in
the
number
and
brilliancy
of
the
fires
they
can
exhibit
on
this
occasion
woods
and
hedges
are
scoured
to
provide
the
materials
for
the
blaze
torches
of
straw
wound
about
poles
are
provided
in
abundance
and
armed
with
them
men
and
women
lads
and
lasses
boys
and
girls
pour
forth
from
the
houses
at
nightfall
into
the
fields
and
orchards
there
they
run
about
among
the
trees
waving
the
lighted
torches
under
the
branches
and
striking
the
trunks
with
them
so
that
the
sparks
fly
out
in
showers
and
as
they
do
so
they
sing
or
scream
at
the
top
of
their
voices
certain
traditional
curses
against
the
animals
and
insects
that
injure
the
they
bid
the
moles
and
to
depart
from
their
orchards
threatening
to
break
their
bones
and
burn
their
beards
if
they
tarry
the
more
they
do
this
the
larger
they
believe
will
be
the
crop
of
fruit
in
the
following
autumn
when
everybody
has
rushed
about
his
own
orchard
meadow
or
pasture
in
this
fashion
they
all
assemble
on
a
height
or
crest
of
a
hill
where
they
picnic
each
bringing
his
share
of
provisions
cider
or
brandy
to
the
feast
there
too
they
kindle
a
huge
bonfire
and
dance
round
it
capering
and
brandishing
their
torches
in
wild
enthusiasm
customs
of
the
same
sort
used
to
be
observed
on
the
same
day
the
eve
of
epiphany
the
fifth
of
january
in
the
ardennes
people
ran
about
with
burning
torches
commanding
the
moles
and
to
go
forth
then
they
threw
the
torches
on
the
ground
and
believed
that
by
this
proceeding
they
purified
the
earth
and
made
it
fruitful
this
ceremony
appears
to
be
intended
to
ensure
a
good
crop
of
fruit
by
burning
out
the
animals
and
insects
that
harm
the
in
some
parts
of
england
it
used
to
be
customary
to
light
fires
at
the
same
season
for
the
purpose
apparently
of
procuring
a
plentiful
crop
of
wheat
in
the
ensuing
autumn
thus
in
the
parish
of
pauntley
a
village
on
the
borders
of
the
county
of
gloucester
next
worcestershire
and
in
the
neighbourhood
a
custom
prevails
which
is
intended
to
prevent
the
smut
in
wheat
on
the
eve
of
all
the
servants
of
every
farmer
assemble
together
in
one
of
the
fields
that
has
been
sown
with
wheat
at
the
end
of
twelve
lands
they
make
twelve
fires
in
a
row
with
straw
around
one
of
which
much
larger
than
the
rest
they
drink
a
cheerful
glass
of
cider
to
their
master
s
health
and
success
to
the
future
harvest
then
returning
home
they
feast
on
cakes
soaked
in
cider
which
they
claim
as
a
reward
for
their
past
labours
in
sowing
the
similarly
in
herefordshire
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
day
at
the
approach
of
evening
the
farmers
their
friends
servants
all
assemble
and
near
six
o
clock
all
walk
together
to
a
field
where
wheat
is
growing
the
highest
part
of
the
ground
is
always
chosen
where
twelve
small
fires
and
one
large
one
are
lighted
up
the
attendants
headed
by
the
master
of
the
family
pledge
the
company
in
old
cyder
which
circulates
freely
on
these
occasions
a
circle
is
formed
round
the
large
fire
when
a
general
shout
and
hallooing
takes
place
which
you
hear
answered
from
all
the
villages
and
fields
near
as
i
have
myself
counted
fifty
or
sixty
fires
burning
at
the
same
time
which
are
generally
placed
on
some
eminence
this
being
finished
the
company
all
return
to
the
house
where
the
good
housewife
and
her
maids
are
preparing
a
good
supper
which
on
this
occasion
is
very
plentiful
a
large
cake
is
always
provided
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
after
supper
the
company
all
attend
the
bailiff
or
head
of
the
oxen
to
the
where
the
following
particulars
are
observed
the
master
at
the
head
of
his
friends
fills
the
cup
generally
of
strong
ale
and
stands
opposite
the
first
or
finest
of
the
oxen
of
which
i
have
often
seen
tied
up
in
their
stalls
together
he
then
pledges
him
in
a
curious
toast
the
company
then
follow
his
example
with
all
the
other
oxen
addressing
each
by
their
name
this
being
over
the
large
cake
is
produced
and
is
with
much
ceremony
put
on
the
horn
of
the
first
ox
through
the
hole
in
the
cake
he
is
then
tickled
to
make
him
toss
his
head
if
he
throws
the
cake
behind
it
is
the
mistress
s
perquisite
if
before
in
what
is
termed
the
the
bailiff
claims
this
prize
this
ended
the
company
all
return
to
the
house
the
doors
of
which
are
in
the
meantime
locked
and
not
opened
till
some
joyous
songs
are
sung
on
entering
a
scene
of
mirth
and
jollity
commences
and
reigns
thro
the
house
till
a
late
or
rather
an
early
hour
the
next
the
custom
was
known
as
wassailing
and
it
was
believed
to
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
the
crops
according
to
one
herefordshire
informant
on
twelfth
day
they
make
twelve
fires
of
straw
and
one
large
one
to
burn
the
old
witch
they
sing
drink
and
dance
round
it
without
this
festival
they
think
they
should
have
no
this
explanation
of
the
large
fire
on
twelfth
day
is
remarkable
and
may
supply
the
key
to
the
whole
custom
of
kindling
fires
on
the
fields
or
in
the
orchards
on
that
day
we
have
seen
that
witches
and
fiends
of
various
sorts
are
believed
to
be
let
loose
during
the
twelve
days
and
that
in
some
places
they
are
formally
driven
away
on
twelfth
night
it
may
well
be
that
the
fires
lighted
on
that
day
were
everywhere
primarily
intended
to
burn
the
witches
and
other
maleficent
beings
swarming
invisible
in
the
air
and
that
the
benefit
supposed
to
be
conferred
by
the
fires
on
the
crops
was
not
so
much
the
positive
one
of
quickening
the
growth
of
vegetation
by
genial
warmth
as
the
negative
one
of
destroying
the
baleful
influences
which
would
otherwise
blast
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
of
the
trees
this
interpretation
of
the
english
and
french
custom
of
lighting
fires
in
fields
and
orchards
on
twelfth
night
is
confirmed
by
a
parallel
custom
observed
by
macedonian
peasants
for
the
express
purpose
of
burning
up
certain
malicious
fiends
who
are
believed
to
be
abroad
at
this
season
these
noxious
beings
are
known
as
or
they
are
thought
to
be
living
people
whether
men
or
women
who
during
the
twelve
days
are
transformed
into
horrible
monsters
with
long
nails
red
faces
bloodshot
eyes
snottering
noses
and
slobbering
mouths
in
this
hideous
guise
they
roam
about
by
night
haunting
houses
and
making
the
peasant
s
life
unbearable
they
knock
at
the
doors
and
should
they
be
refused
admittance
they
will
scramble
down
the
chimney
and
pinch
worry
and
defile
the
sleepers
in
their
beds
the
only
way
to
escape
from
these
tormenters
is
to
seize
and
bind
them
fast
with
a
straw
rope
if
you
have
no
such
rope
or
your
heart
fails
you
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
shut
yourself
up
in
the
house
before
dark
fasten
the
door
tight
block
up
the
chimney
and
wait
for
daylight
for
it
is
only
at
night
that
the
monsters
are
on
the
prowl
during
the
day
they
resume
their
ordinary
human
shape
however
in
some
places
strenuous
efforts
are
made
during
the
twelve
days
to
destroy
these
hateful
nocturnal
goblins
by
fire
for
example
on
christmas
eve
some
people
burn
the
by
lighting
faggots
of
and
throwing
them
out
into
the
streets
at
early
dawn
in
other
places
notably
at
melenik
they
scald
the
fiends
to
death
on
new
year
s
eve
by
means
of
pancakes
frizzling
and
hissing
in
a
pan
while
the
goodwife
is
baking
the
cakes
the
goodman
disguises
himself
as
one
of
the
fiends
in
a
fur
coat
turned
inside
out
and
in
his
assumed
character
dances
and
sings
outside
the
door
while
he
invites
his
wife
to
join
him
in
the
dance
in
other
districts
people
collect
faggots
during
the
whole
of
the
twelve
days
and
lay
them
up
on
the
hearth
then
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
night
they
set
fire
to
the
pile
in
order
that
the
goblins
who
are
supposed
to
be
lurking
under
the
ashes
may
utterly
perish
thus
the
view
that
the
large
fire
in
herefordshire
on
twelfth
night
is
intended
to
burn
the
old
witch
is
far
more
probable
than
the
opinion
that
it
represents
the
virgin
mary
and
that
the
other
twelve
fires
stand
for
the
twelve
apostles
this
latter
interpretation
is
in
all
probability
nothing
more
than
a
christian
gloss
put
upon
an
old
heathen
custom
of
which
the
meaning
was
forgotten
the
gloucestershire
custom
was
described
by
the
english
traveller
thomas
pennant
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
says
a
custom
savouring
of
the
scotch
prevales
in
gloucestershire
particularly
about
newent
and
the
neighbouring
parishes
on
the
twelfth
day
or
on
the
epiphany
in
the
evening
all
the
servants
of
every
particular
farmer
assemble
together
in
one
of
the
fields
that
has
been
sown
with
wheat
on
the
border
of
which
in
the
most
conspicuous
or
most
elevated
place
they
make
twelve
fires
of
straw
in
a
row
around
one
of
which
made
larger
than
the
rest
they
drink
a
cheerful
glass
of
cyder
to
their
master
s
health
success
to
the
future
harvest
and
then
returning
home
they
feast
on
cakes
made
of
carraways
soaked
in
cyder
which
they
claim
as
a
reward
for
their
past
labours
in
sowing
the
in
shropshire
also
it
used
to
be
customary
to
kindle
festal
fires
on
the
tops
of
hills
and
other
high
places
on
twelfth
night
again
in
ireland
on
in
christmas
they
use
to
set
up
as
high
as
they
can
a
sieve
of
oats
and
in
it
a
dozen
of
candles
set
round
and
in
the
centre
one
larger
all
lighted
this
in
memory
of
our
saviour
and
his
apostles
lights
of
the
down
to
the
present
time
apparently
in
the
county
of
roscommon
twelfth
night
which
is
old
christmas
day
is
a
greater
day
than
christmas
day
itself
thirteen
rushlights
are
made
in
remembrance
of
the
numbers
at
the
last
supper
and
each
is
named
after
some
member
of
the
family
if
there
are
not
enough
in
the
household
other
relations
names
are
added
the
candles
are
stuck
in
a
cake
of
and
lighted
and
as
each
burns
out
so
will
be
the
length
of
each
person
s
life
rushlights
are
only
used
for
this
in
these
english
and
irish
customs
observed
on
twelfth
night
the
twelve
fires
or
candles
probably
refer
either
to
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
epiphany
or
to
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
in
favour
of
this
view
it
may
be
said
that
according
to
a
popular
opinion
which
has
been
reported
in
england
and
is
widely
diffused
in
germany
and
the
german
provinces
of
austria
the
weather
of
the
twelve
days
in
question
determines
the
weather
of
the
twelve
following
months
so
that
from
the
weather
on
each
of
these
days
it
is
possible
to
predict
the
weather
of
the
corresponding
month
in
the
ensuing
year
hence
in
swabia
the
days
are
called
the
twelve
lot
days
and
many
people
seek
to
pry
into
the
future
with
scientific
precision
by
means
of
twelve
circles
each
subdivided
into
four
quadrants
which
they
chalk
up
over
the
parlour
door
or
inscribe
on
paper
each
circle
represents
a
month
and
each
quadrant
represents
a
quarter
of
a
month
and
according
as
the
sky
is
overcast
or
clear
during
each
quarter
of
a
day
from
christmas
to
epiphany
you
shade
the
corresponding
quadrant
of
a
circle
or
leave
it
a
blank
by
this
contrivance
as
simple
as
it
is
ingenious
you
may
forecast
the
weather
for
the
whole
year
with
more
or
less
of
accuracy
at
hosskirch
in
swabia
they
say
that
you
can
predict
the
weather
for
the
twelve
months
from
the
weather
of
the
twelve
hours
of
twelfth
day
alone
a
somewhat
different
system
of
meteorology
is
adopted
in
various
parts
of
switzerland
germany
and
austria
on
christmas
new
year
s
day
or
another
of
the
twelve
days
you
take
an
onion
slice
it
in
two
peel
off
twelve
coats
and
sprinkle
a
pinch
of
salt
in
each
of
them
the
twelve
coats
of
the
onion
stand
for
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
and
from
the
amount
of
moisture
which
has
gathered
in
each
of
them
next
morning
you
may
foretell
the
amount
of
rain
that
will
fall
in
the
corresponding
month
but
the
belief
that
the
weather
of
the
twelve
months
can
be
predicted
from
the
weather
of
the
twelve
days
is
not
confined
to
the
germanic
peoples
it
occurs
also
in
france
and
among
the
celts
of
brittany
and
scotland
thus
in
the
bocage
of
normandy
the
village
old
wives
have
a
very
simple
means
of
divining
the
general
temperature
of
the
coming
season
according
to
them
the
twelve
days
between
christmas
and
epiphany
including
epiphany
represent
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
so
the
thing
to
do
is
to
mark
the
temperature
of
each
of
these
days
for
the
temperature
of
the
corresponding
month
will
be
relatively
the
same
some
people
say
that
this
experience
is
rarely
at
fault
and
more
trust
is
put
in
it
than
in
the
predictions
of
the
in
cornouaille
brittany
it
is
popularly
believed
that
the
weather
of
the
last
six
days
of
december
and
the
first
six
of
january
prognosticates
the
weather
of
the
twelve
months
but
in
other
parts
of
brittany
it
is
the
first
twelve
days
of
january
that
are
supposed
to
be
ominous
of
the
weather
for
the
year
these
days
are
called
which
is
commonly
interpreted
male
days
but
is
said
to
mean
properly
additional
or
supplementary
again
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
twelve
days
of
christmas
latha
dheug
na
were
the
twelve
days
commencing
from
the
nativity
or
big
and
were
deemed
to
represent
in
respect
of
weather
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
some
say
the
days
should
be
calculated
from
new
year
s
others
again
reckon
the
twelve
days
from
the
of
december
thus
pennant
tells
us
that
the
highlanders
form
a
sort
of
almanack
or
presage
of
the
weather
of
the
ensuing
year
in
the
following
manner
they
make
observation
on
twelve
days
beginning
at
the
last
of
december
and
hold
as
an
infallible
rule
that
whatsoever
weather
happens
on
each
of
those
days
the
same
will
prove
to
agree
in
the
correspondent
months
thus
january
is
to
answer
to
the
weather
of
december
february
to
that
of
january
and
so
with
the
rest
old
people
still
pay
great
attention
to
this
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
in
the
celtic
regions
of
scotland
and
france
popular
opinion
hesitates
as
to
the
exact
date
of
the
twelve
days
some
people
dating
them
from
christmas
others
from
the
new
year
and
others
again
from
the
of
december
this
hesitation
has
an
important
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
origin
of
the
twelve
days
period
as
i
shall
point
out
immediately
thus
in
the
popular
mind
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
epiphany
are
conceived
as
a
miniature
of
the
whole
year
the
character
of
each
particular
day
answering
to
the
character
of
a
particular
month
the
conception
appears
to
be
very
ancient
for
it
meets
us
again
among
the
aryans
of
the
vedic
age
in
india
they
too
appear
to
have
invested
twelve
days
in
midwinter
with
a
sacred
character
as
a
time
when
the
three
ribhus
or
genii
of
the
seasons
rested
from
their
labours
in
the
home
of
the
and
these
twelve
they
called
an
image
or
copy
of
the
this
curious
coincidence
if
such
it
is
between
the
winter
festivals
of
the
ancient
aryans
of
india
and
their
modern
kinsfolk
in
europe
seems
to
be
best
explained
on
the
theory
that
the
twelve
days
in
question
derive
their
sanctity
from
the
position
which
they
occupied
in
the
calendar
of
the
primitive
aryans
the
coincidence
of
the
name
for
month
with
the
name
for
moon
in
the
various
aryan
languages
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
year
of
our
remote
ancestors
was
primarily
based
on
observation
of
the
moon
rather
than
of
the
sun
but
as
a
year
of
twelve
lunar
months
or
three
hundred
and
days
reckoning
the
months
at
and
thirty
days
alternately
falls
short
of
the
solar
year
of
three
hundred
and
and
a
quarter
days
by
roundly
twelve
days
the
discrepancy
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
an
intelligent
people
such
as
the
primitive
aryans
must
be
supposed
to
have
been
who
had
made
some
progress
in
the
arts
of
life
and
the
most
obvious
way
of
removing
the
discrepancy
and
equating
the
lunar
with
the
solar
year
is
to
add
twelve
days
at
the
end
of
each
period
of
twelve
lunar
months
so
as
to
bring
the
total
days
of
the
year
up
to
three
hundred
and
the
equation
is
not
indeed
perfectly
exact
but
it
may
well
have
been
sufficiently
so
for
the
rudimentary
science
of
the
primitive
aryans
as
many
savage
races
in
modern
times
have
observed
the
discrepancy
between
solar
and
lunar
time
and
have
essayed
to
correct
it
by
observations
of
the
sun
or
the
constellations
especially
the
pleiades
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
ancestors
of
the
peoples
in
prehistoric
times
were
able
to
make
similar
observations
and
that
they
were
not
as
has
been
suggested
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
borrowing
the
knowledge
of
such
simple
and
obvious
facts
from
the
of
ancient
babylonia
learned
men
who
make
little
use
of
their
eyes
except
to
read
books
are
too
apt
to
underrate
the
observational
powers
of
the
savage
who
lives
under
totally
different
conditions
from
us
spending
most
of
his
time
in
the
open
air
and
depending
for
his
very
existence
on
the
accuracy
with
which
he
notes
the
varied
and
changing
aspects
of
nature
it
has
been
proposed
to
explain
the
manifold
superstitions
which
cluster
round
the
twelve
days
or
rather
the
twelve
nights
as
they
are
more
popularly
called
by
reference
to
the
place
which
they
occupy
in
the
christian
calendar
beginning
as
they
do
immediately
after
christmas
and
ending
with
epiphany
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
interval
between
these
two
particular
festivals
should
have
attracted
to
itself
a
greater
mass
of
superstitious
belief
and
custom
than
the
interval
between
any
other
two
christian
festivals
in
the
calendar
if
it
really
did
so
the
ground
of
its
special
attraction
is
still
to
seek
and
on
this
essential
point
the
advocates
of
the
christian
origin
of
the
twelve
nights
throw
no
light
in
the
second
place
the
superstitious
beliefs
and
customs
themselves
appear
to
have
no
relation
to
christianity
but
to
be
purely
pagan
in
character
lastly
a
fatal
objection
to
the
theory
in
question
is
that
the
place
of
the
twelve
days
in
the
calendar
is
not
uniformly
fixed
to
the
interval
between
christmas
and
epiphany
it
varies
considerably
in
popular
opinion
in
different
places
but
it
is
significant
that
the
variations
never
exceed
certain
comparatively
narrow
limits
the
festival
so
to
speak
oscillates
to
and
fro
about
a
fixed
point
which
is
either
the
end
of
the
year
or
the
winter
solstice
thus
in
silesia
the
twelve
days
are
usually
reckoned
to
fall
before
christmas
instead
of
after
it
though
in
the
polish
districts
and
the
mountainous
region
of
the
country
the
ordinary
german
opinion
prevails
that
the
days
immediately
follow
christmas
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
the
twelve
days
are
counted
from
thomas
s
day
the
of
december
to
new
year
s
day
while
in
parts
of
mecklenburg
they
begin
with
new
year
s
day
and
so
coincide
with
the
first
twelve
days
of
january
and
this
last
mode
of
reckoning
finds
favour
as
we
saw
with
some
celts
of
brittany
and
scotland
these
variations
in
the
dating
of
the
twelve
days
seem
irreconcilable
with
the
theory
that
they
derive
their
superstitious
character
purely
from
the
accident
that
they
fall
between
christmas
and
epiphany
accordingly
we
may
safely
dismiss
the
theory
of
their
christian
origin
and
recognize
with
many
good
authorities
in
the
twelve
days
the
relics
of
a
purely
pagan
festival
which
was
probably
celebrated
long
before
the
foundation
of
christianity
in
truth
the
hypothesis
of
the
christian
derivation
of
the
twelve
days
in
all
probability
exactly
inverts
the
historical
order
of
the
facts
on
the
whole
the
evidence
goes
to
shew
that
the
great
christian
festivals
were
arbitrarily
timed
by
the
church
so
as
to
coincide
with
previously
existing
pagan
festivals
for
the
sake
of
weaning
the
heathen
from
their
old
faith
and
bringing
them
over
to
the
new
religion
to
make
the
transition
as
easy
as
possible
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
in
abolishing
the
ancient
rites
appointed
ceremonies
of
somewhat
similar
character
on
the
same
days
or
nearly
so
thus
filling
up
the
spiritual
void
by
a
new
creation
which
the
worshipper
might
accept
as
an
adequate
substitute
for
what
he
had
lost
christmas
and
easter
the
two
pivots
on
which
the
christian
calendar
revolves
appear
both
to
have
been
instituted
with
this
intention
the
one
superseded
a
midwinter
festival
of
the
birth
of
the
the
other
superseded
a
vernal
festival
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
if
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
epiphany
were
indeed
an
ancient
intercalary
period
inserted
for
the
purpose
of
equating
the
lunar
to
the
solar
year
we
can
better
understand
the
curious
superstitions
that
have
clustered
round
them
and
the
quaint
customs
that
have
been
annually
observed
during
their
continuance
to
the
primitive
mind
it
might
well
seem
that
an
intercalary
period
stands
outside
of
the
regular
order
of
things
forming
part
neither
of
the
lunar
nor
of
the
solar
system
it
is
an
excrescence
inevitable
but
unaccountable
which
breaks
the
smooth
surface
of
ordinary
existence
an
eddy
which
interrupts
the
even
flow
of
months
and
years
hence
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
conduct
do
not
apply
to
such
extraordinary
periods
and
that
accordingly
men
may
do
in
them
what
they
would
never
dream
of
doing
at
other
times
thus
intercalary
days
tend
to
degenerate
into
seasons
of
unbridled
license
they
form
an
interregnum
during
which
the
customary
restraints
of
law
and
morality
are
suspended
and
the
ordinary
rulers
abdicate
their
authority
in
favour
of
a
temporary
regent
a
sort
of
puppet
king
who
bears
a
more
or
less
indefinite
capricious
and
precarious
sway
over
a
community
given
up
for
a
time
to
riot
turbulence
and
disorder
if
that
is
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
view
here
suggested
is
to
a
great
extent
may
perhaps
detect
the
last
surviving
representatives
of
such
puppet
kings
in
the
king
of
the
bean
and
other
grotesque
figures
of
the
same
sort
who
used
to
parade
with
the
mimic
pomp
of
sovereignty
on
one
or
other
of
the
twelve
days
between
christmas
and
epiphany
for
the
king
of
the
bean
was
by
no
means
the
only
such
ruler
of
the
festive
season
nor
was
twelfth
night
the
only
day
on
which
he
and
his
colleagues
played
their
pranks
we
will
conclude
this
part
of
our
subject
with
a
brief
notice
of
some
of
these
mummers
in
the
first
place
it
deserves
to
be
noticed
that
in
many
parts
of
the
continent
such
as
france
spain
belgium
germany
and
austria
twelfth
day
is
regularly
associated
with
three
mythical
kings
named
caspar
melchior
and
balthasar
and
derives
its
popular
appellation
from
them
being
known
in
germany
and
austria
as
the
day
of
the
three
kings
and
in
france
as
the
festival
of
the
kings
des
further
it
has
been
customary
in
many
places
to
represent
the
three
kings
by
mummers
who
go
about
arrayed
in
royal
costume
from
door
to
door
singing
songs
and
collecting
contributions
from
the
households
which
they
visit
the
custom
may
very
well
be
older
than
christianity
though
it
has
received
a
christian
colouring
for
the
mythical
kings
are
commonly
identified
with
the
wise
men
of
the
east
who
are
said
to
have
been
attracted
to
the
infant
christ
at
bethlehem
by
the
sight
of
his
star
in
the
sky
yet
there
is
no
biblical
authority
for
regarding
these
wise
men
as
kings
or
for
fixing
their
number
at
three
in
the
old
custom
is
still
observed
or
at
all
events
it
was
so
down
to
recent
years
the
three
kings
are
personated
by
three
boys
dressed
in
long
white
shirts
with
coloured
sashes
round
their
waists
on
their
heads
they
wear
pointed
mitres
of
pasteboard
decorated
with
a
gilt
star
and
floating
ribbons
each
carries
a
long
wand
topped
by
a
star
which
he
keeps
constantly
turning
the
one
who
personates
melchior
has
his
face
blackened
with
soot
because
melchior
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
negro
king
when
they
enter
a
house
they
sing
a
song
setting
forth
that
they
are
three
kings
who
have
come
from
three
different
countries
led
by
a
star
to
adore
the
infant
jesus
at
bethlehem
after
the
song
the
negro
king
solicits
contributions
by
shaking
his
or
holding
out
a
basket
in
which
the
inmates
of
the
house
deposit
eggs
nuts
apples
and
so
forth
by
way
of
thanks
for
this
liberality
the
three
kings
chant
a
stave
in
which
they
call
down
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
household
the
custom
is
similar
in
the
vosges
mountains
where
the
three
kings
are
held
in
great
veneration
and
invoked
by
hedge
doctors
to
effect
various
cures
for
example
if
a
man
drops
to
the
ground
with
the
falling
sickness
you
need
only
whisper
in
his
right
ear
fert
myrrham
thus
melchior
balthasar
and
he
will
get
up
at
once
but
to
make
the
cure
complete
you
must
knock
three
nails
into
the
earth
on
the
precise
spot
where
he
fell
each
nail
must
be
exactly
of
the
length
of
the
patient
s
little
finger
and
as
you
knock
it
in
you
must
take
care
to
utter
the
sufferer
s
name
in
many
czech
villages
of
bohemia
the
children
who
play
the
part
of
the
three
kings
assimilate
themselves
to
the
wise
men
of
the
east
in
the
gospel
by
carrying
gilt
paper
incense
and
myrrh
with
them
on
their
rounds
which
they
distribute
as
gifts
in
the
houses
they
visit
receiving
in
return
money
or
presents
in
kind
moreover
they
fumigate
and
sprinkle
the
houses
and
describe
crosses
and
letters
on
the
doors
amongst
the
germans
of
west
bohemia
it
is
the
schoolmaster
who
accompanied
by
some
boys
goes
the
round
of
the
village
on
twelfth
day
he
chalks
up
the
letters
b
the
initials
of
caspar
melchior
and
balthasar
together
with
three
crosses
on
every
door
and
fumigates
the
house
with
a
burning
censer
in
order
to
guard
it
from
evil
influences
and
infectious
diseases
some
people
used
to
wear
as
an
amulet
a
picture
representing
the
adoration
of
the
three
kings
with
a
latin
inscription
to
the
following
effect
holy
three
kings
caspar
melchior
balthasar
pray
for
us
now
and
in
the
hour
of
our
the
picture
was
thought
to
protect
the
wearer
not
only
from
epilepsy
headache
and
fever
but
also
from
the
perils
of
the
roads
from
the
bite
of
mad
dogs
from
sudden
death
from
sorcery
and
witchcraft
whatever
its
origin
the
festival
of
the
three
kings
goes
back
to
the
middle
ages
for
it
is
known
to
have
been
celebrated
with
great
pomp
at
milan
in
on
that
occasion
the
three
kings
appeared
wearing
crowns
riding
richly
caparisoned
horses
and
surrounded
by
pages
bodyguards
and
a
great
retinue
of
followers
before
them
was
carried
a
golden
star
and
they
offered
gifts
of
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
to
the
infant
christ
cradled
in
a
manger
beside
the
high
altar
of
the
church
of
st
eustorgius
in
our
own
country
a
popular
figure
during
the
christmas
holidays
used
to
be
the
lord
of
misrule
or
as
he
was
called
in
scotland
the
abbot
of
unreason
who
led
the
revels
at
that
merry
season
in
the
halls
of
colleges
the
inns
of
court
the
palace
of
the
king
and
the
mansions
of
nobles
writing
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
antiquary
john
stow
tells
us
that
in
the
feast
of
christmas
there
was
in
the
king
s
house
wheresoever
he
was
lodged
a
lord
of
misrule
or
master
of
merry
disports
and
the
like
had

in

house
of
every
nobleman
of

good
worship
were

spiritual

temporal
amongst
the
which
the
mayor
of
london
and
either
of

sheriffs
had
their
several
lords
of
misrule
ever
contending
without
quarrel
or
offence
who
should
make
the
rarest
pastimes
to
delight
the
beholders
these
lords
beginning
their
rule

there
were
fine
and
subtle
disguisings
masks
and
mummeries
with
playing
at
cards
for
counters
nails
and
points
in
every
house
more
for

than
for
again
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
ardent
royalist
sir
thomas
urquhart
wrote
that
they
may
be
likewise
said
to
use
their
king
as
about
christmas
we
do
the
king
of
misrule
whom
we
invest
with
that
title
to
no
other
end
but
to
countenance
the
bacchanalian
riots
and
preposterous
disorders
of
the
family
where
he
is
from
the
former
passage
it
appears
that
the
lords
of
misrule
often
or
even
generally
reigned
for
more
than
three
months
in
winter
namely
from
allhallow
even
the
of
october
the
eve
of
all
saints
day
till
candlemas
the
second
of
february
sometimes
however
their
reign
seems
to
have
been
restricted
to
the
twelve
nights
thus
we
are
told
that
george
ferrers
of
lincoln
s
inn
was
lord
of
misrule
for
twelve
days
one
year
when
king
edward
vi
kept
his
christmas
with
open
house
at
greenwich
at
trinity
college
cambridge
a
master
of
arts
used
to
be
appointed
to
this
honourable
office
which
he
held
for
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
twelfth
day
and
he
resumed
office
on
candlemas
day
his
duty
was
to
regulate
the
games
and
diversions
of
the
students
particularly
the
plays
which
were
acted
in
the
college
hall
similar
masters
of
the
revels
were
commonly
instituted
in
the
colleges
at
oxford
for
example
at
merton
college
the
fellows
annually
elected
about
edmund
s
day
in
november
a
lord
of
misrule
or
as
he
was
called
in
the
registers
a
king
of
the
bean
who
held
office
till
candlemas
and
sometimes
assumed
a
number
of
ridiculous
titles
in
the
inner
temple
a
lord
of
misrule
used
to
be
appointed
on
stephen
s
day
the
of
december
surrounded
by
his
courtiers
who
were
dubbed
by
various
derogatory
or
ribald
names
he
presided
at
the
dancing
feasting
and
minstrelsy
in
the
hall
of
the
mock
monarch
who
in
the
christmas
holidays
of
held
office
in
the
middle
temple
the
jurisdiction
privileges
and
parade
have
been
minutely
described
he
was
attended
by
his
lord
keeper
lord
treasurer
with
eight
white
staves
a
band
of
gentleman
pensioners
with
poleaxes
and
two
chaplains
he
dined
under
a
canopy
of
state
both
in
the
hall
and
in
his
own
chambers
he
received
many
petitions
which
he
passed
on
in
regal
style
to
his
master
of
requests
and
he
attended
service
in
the
temple
church
where
his
chaplains
preached
before
him
and
did
him
reverence
his
expenses
defrayed
from
his
own
purse
amounted
to
no
less
than
two
thousand
pounds
i
remember
to
have
heard
a
bencher
of
the
temple
tell
a
story
of
a
tradition
in
their
house
where
they
had
formerly
a
custom
of
choosing
kings
for
such
a
season
and
allowing
him
his
expences
at
the
charge
of
the
society
one
of
our
kings
said
my
friend
carried
his
royal
inclination
a
little
too
far
and
there
was
a
committee
ordered
to
look
into
the
management
of
his
treasury
among
other
things
it
appeared
that
his
majesty
walking
in
the
cloister
had
overheard
a
poor
man
say
to
another
such
a
small
sum
would
make
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
the
king
out
of
his
royal
compassion
privately
inquired
into
his
character
and
finding
him
a
proper
object
of
charity
sent
him
the
money
when
the
committee
read
the
report
the
house
passed
his
accounts
with
a
plaudite
without
further
examination
upon
the
recital
of
this
article
in
them
for
making
a
man
happy
at
the
english
court
the
annual
lord
of
misrule
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
master
of
the
revels
who
was
a
permanent
official
and
probably
despised
the
temporary
lord
as
an
upstart
rival
and
intruder
certainly
there
seems
to
have
been
at
times
bad
blood
between
them
some
correspondence
which
passed
between
the
two
merry
monarchs
in
the
reign
of
edward
vi
has
been
preserved
and
from
it
we
learn
that
on
one
occasion
the
lord
of
misrule
had
much
difficulty
in
extracting
from
the
master
of
the
revels
the
fool
s
coat
and
other
trumpery
paraphernalia
which
he
required
for
the
proper
support
of
his
dignity
indeed
the
costumes
furnished
by
his
rival
were
so
shabby
that
his
lordship
returned
them
with
a
note
in
which
he
informed
the
master
of
the
revels
that
the
gentlemen
of
rank
and
position
who
were
to
wear
these
liveries
stood
too
much
on
their
dignity
to
be
seen
prancing
about
the
streets
of
london
rigged
out
in
such
old
slops
the
lords
of
council
had
actually
to
interpose
in
the
petty
squabble
between
the
two
potentates
in
france
the
counterparts
of
these
english
lords
of
misrule
masqueraded
in
clerical
attire
as
mock
bishops
archbishops
popes
or
abbots
the
festival
at
which
they
disported
themselves
was
known
as
the
festival
of
fools
des
which
fell
in
different
places
at
different
dates
sometimes
on
christmas
day
sometimes
on
stephen
s
day
the
of
december
sometimes
on
new
year
s
day
and
sometimes
on
twelfth
day
according
to
one
account
on
the
first
day
which
was
the
festival
of
christmas
the
lower
orders
of
clergy
and
monks
cried
in
unison
christmas
and
gave
themselves
up
to
jollity
on
the
morrow
stephen
s
day
the
deacons
held
a
council
to
elect
a
pope
or
patriarch
of
fools
a
bishop
or
archbishop
of
innocents
an
abbot
of
ninnies
next
day
the
festival
of
john
the
subdeacons
began
the
dance
in
his
honour
afterwards
on
the
fourth
day
the
festival
of
the
holy
innocents
the
choristers
and
minor
clergy
claimed
the
pope
or
bishop
or
abbot
elect
who
made
his
triumphal
entry
into
the
church
on
circumcision
day
the
first
of
january
and
sat
enthroned
pontifically
till
the
evening
of
epiphany
it
was
then
the
joyous
reign
of
this
pope
or
this
bishop
or
this
abbot
of
folly
which
constituted
the
festival
of
fools
and
dominated
its
whimsical
phases
the
grotesque
and
sometimes
impious
masquerades
the
merry
and
often
disgusting
scenes
the
furious
orgies
the
dances
the
games
the
profane
songs
the
impudent
parodies
of
the
catholic
at
these
parodies
of
the
most
solemn
rites
of
the
church
the
priests
wearing
grotesque
masks
and
sometimes
dressed
as
women
danced
in
the
choir
and
sang
obscene
chants
laymen
disguised
as
monks
and
nuns
mingled
with
the
clergy
the
altar
was
transformed
into
a
tavern
where
the
deacons
and
subdeacons
ate
sausages
and
or
played
at
dice
and
cards
under
the
nose
of
the
celebrant
and
the
censers
smoked
with
bits
of
old
shoes
instead
of
incense
filling
the
church
with
a
foul
stench
after
playing
these
pranks
and
running
leaping
and
cutting
capers
through
the
whole
church
they
rode
about
the
town
in
mean
carts
exchanging
scurrilities
with
the
crowds
of
laughing
and
jeering
spectators
amongst
the
buffooneries
of
the
festival
of
fools
one
of
the
most
remarkable
was
the
introduction
of
an
ass
into
the
church
where
various
pranks
were
played
with
the
animal
at
autun
the
ass
was
led
with
great
ceremony
to
the
church
under
a
cloth
of
gold
the
corners
of
which
were
held
by
four
canons
and
on
entering
the
sacred
edifice
the
animal
was
wrapt
in
a
rich
cope
while
a
parody
of
the
mass
was
performed
a
regular
latin
liturgy
in
glorification
of
the
ass
was
chanted
on
these
occasions
and
the
celebrant
priest
imitated
the
braying
of
an
ass
at
beauvais
the
ceremony
was
performed
every
year
on
the
fourteenth
of
january
a
young
girl
with
a
child
in
her
arms
rode
on
the
back
of
the
ass
in
imitation
of
the
flight
into
egypt
escorted
by
the
clergy
and
the
people
she
was
led
in
triumph
from
the
cathedral
to
the
parish
church
of
stephen
there
she
and
her
ass
were
introduced
into
the
chancel
and
stationed
on
the
left
side
of
the
altar
and
a
long
mass
was
performed
which
consisted
of
scraps
borrowed
indiscriminately
from
the
services
of
many
church
festivals
throughout
the
year
in
the
intervals
the
singers
quenched
their
thirst
the
congregation
imitated
their
example
and
the
ass
was
fed
and
watered
the
services
over
the
animal
was
brought
from
the
chancel
into
the
nave
where
the
whole
congregation
clergy
and
laity
mixed
up
together
danced
round
the
animal
and
brayed
like
asses
finally
after
vespers
and
compline
the
merry
procession
led
by
the
precentor
and
preceded
by
a
huge
lantern
defiled
through
the
streets
to
wind
up
the
day
with
indecent
farces
in
a
great
theatre
erected
opposite
the
church
a
pale
reflection
or
diminutive
copy
of
the
festival
of
fools
was
the
festival
of
the
innocents
which
was
celebrated
on
childermas
or
holy
innocents
day
the
of
december
the
custom
was
widely
observed
both
in
france
and
england
in
france
on
childermas
or
the
eve
of
the
festival
the
choristers
assembled
in
the
church
and
chose
one
of
their
number
to
be
a
boy
bishop
who
officiated
in
that
character
with
mock
solemnity
such
burlesques
of
ecclesiastical
ritual
appear
to
have
been
common
on
that
day
in
monasteries
and
convents
where
the
offices
performed
by
the
clergy
and
laity
were
inverted
for
the
occasion
at
the
franciscan
monastery
of
antibes
for
example
the
lay
brothers
who
usually
worked
in
the
kitchen
and
the
garden
took
the
place
of
the
priests
on
childermas
and
celebrated
mass
in
church
clad
in
tattered
sacerdotal
vestments
turned
inside
out
holding
the
books
upside
down
wearing
spectacles
made
of
orange
peel
mumbling
an
unintelligible
jargon
and
uttering
frightful
cries
these
buffooneries
were
kept
up
certainly
as
late
as
the
eighteenth
century
and
probably
later
in
the
great
convent
of
the
congrégation
de
notre
dame
at
paris
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
nuns
and
their
girl
pupils
regularly
exchanged
parts
on
holy
innocents
day
the
pupils
pretended
to
be
nuns
and
a
select
few
of
them
were
attired
as
such
while
the
nuns
made
believe
to
be
pupils
without
however
changing
their
dress
in
england
the
boy
bishop
was
widely
popular
during
the
later
middle
ages
and
only
succumbed
to
the
austerity
of
the
reformation
he
is
known
for
example
to
have
officiated
in
paul
s
london
in
the
cathedrals
of
salisbury
exeter
hereford
gloucester
lichfield
norwich
lincoln
and
york
in
great
collegiate
churches
such
as
beverley
minster
peter

canterbury
and
ottery
mary

in
college
chapels
such
as
magdalen
and
all
souls
at
oxford
in
the
private
chapels
of
the
king
and
in
many
parish
churches
throughout
the
country
the
election
was
usually
made
on
nicholas
s
day
the
sixth
of
december
but
the
office
and
authority
lasted
till
holy
innocents
day
the
of
december
both
days
were
appropriate
for
nicholas
was
the
patron
saint
of
school
children
and
holy
innocents
day
commemorates
the
slaughter
of
the
young
children
by
herod
in
cathedrals
the
bishop
was
chosen
from
among
the
choir
boys
after
his
election
he
was
completely
apparelled
in
the
episcopal
vestments
with
a
mitre
and
crosier
bore
the
title
and
displayed
the
state
of
a
bishop
and
exacted
ceremonial
obedience
from
his
fellows
who
were
dressed
like
priests
they
took
possession
of
the
church
and
with
the
exception
of
mass
performed
all
the
ceremonies
and
offices
the
boy
bishop
preached
from
the
pulpit
at
salisbury
the
ceremonies
at
which
he
presided
are
elaborately
regulated
by
the
statutes
of
roger
de
mortival
enacted
in
and
two
of
the
great
of
the
sarum
use
the
breviary
and
the
processional
furnish
full
details
of
the
ministrations
of
the
boy
bishop
and
his
fellows
he
is
even
said
to
have
enjoyed
the
right
of
disposing
of
such
prebends
as
happened
to
fall
vacant
during
the
days
of
his
episcopacy
but
the
pranks
of
the
mock
bishop
were
not
confined
to
the
church
arrayed
in
full
canonicals
he
was
led
about
with
songs
and
dances
from
house
to
house
blessing
the
grinning
people
and
collecting
money
in
return
for
his
benedictions
at
york
in
the
year
the
boy
bishop
is
known
to
have
gone
on
his
rounds
to
places
so
far
distant
as
bridlington
leeds
beverley
fountains
abbey
and
allerton
and
the
profits
which
he
made
were
considerable
william
of
wykeham
ordained
in
that
a
boy
bishop
should
be
chosen
at
winchester
college
and
another
at
new
college
oxford
and
that
he
should
recite
the
office
at
the
feast
of
the
innocents
his
example
was
followed
some
forty
years
afterwards
in
the
statutes
of
the
royal
foundations
of
eton
college
and
of
king
s
college
cambridge
from
being
elected
on
nicholas
s
day
the
boy
bishop
was
sometimes
called
a
nicholas
bishop
in
spanish
cathedrals
also
it
appears
to
have
been
customary
on
nicholas
s
day
to
elect
a
chorister
to
the
office
of
bishop
he
exercised
a
certain
jurisdiction
till
holy
innocents
day
and
his
prebendaries
took
secular
offices
acting
in
the
capacity
of
alguazils
catchpoles
and
sweepers
on
the
whole
it
seems
difficult
to
suppose
that
the
a
curious
superstitions
and
quaint
ceremonies
the
outbursts
of
profanity
and
the
inversions
of
ranks
which
characterize
the
popular
celebration
of
the
twelve
days
from
christmas
to
epiphany
have
any
connexion
with
the
episodes
of
christian
history
believed
to
be
commemorated
by
these
two
festivals
more
probably
they
are
relics
of
an
old
heathen
festival
celebrated
during
the
twelve
intercalary
days
which
our
forefathers
annually
inserted
in
their
calendar
at
midwinter
in
order
to
equalize
the
short
lunar
year
of
twelve
months
with
the
longer
solar
year
of
three
hundred
and
or
days
we
need
not
assume
that
the
license
and
buffooneries
of
the
festive
season
were
borrowed
from
the
roman
saturnalia
both
celebrations
may
well
have
been
parallel
and
independent
deductions
from
a
like
primitive
philosophy
of
nature
there
is
not
indeed
so
far
as
i
am
aware
any
direct
evidence
that
the
saturnalia
at
rome
was
an
intercalary
festival
but
the
license
which
characterized
it
and
the
temporary
reign
of
a
mock
king
who
personated
saturn
suggest
that
it
may
have
been
so
if
we
were
better
acquainted
with
the
intercalary
periods
of
peoples
at
a
comparatively
low
level
of
culture
we
might
find
that
they
are
commonly
marked
by
similar
outbreaks
of
lawlessness
and
similar
reigns
of
more
or
less
nominal
and
farcical
rulers
but
unfortunately
we
know
too
little
about
the
observance
of
such
periods
among
primitive
peoples
to
be
warranted
in
making
any
positive
affirmation
on
the
subject
however
there
are
grounds
for
thinking
that
intercalary
periods
have
commonly
been
esteemed
unlucky
the
aztecs
certainly
regarded
as
very
unlucky
the
five
supplementary
days
which
they
added
at
the
end
of
every
year
in
order
to
make
up
a
total
of
three
hundred
and
days
these
five
supplementary
days
corresponding
to
the
last
four
of
january
and
the
first
of
february
were
called
which
means
vacant
superfluous
or
being
dedicated
to
no
god
they
were
deemed
inauspicious
equally
unfit
for
the
services
of
religion
and
the
transaction
of
civil
business
during
their
continuance
no
sacrifices
were
offered
by
the
priests
and
no
worshippers
frequented
the
temples
no
cases
were
tried
in
the
courts
of
justice
the
houses
were
not
swept
people
abstained
from
all
actions
of
importance
and
confined
themselves
to
performing
such
as
could
not
be
avoided
or
spent
the
time
in
paying
visits
to
each
other
in
particular
they
were
careful
during
these
fatal
days
not
to
fall
asleep
in
the
daytime
not
to
quarrel
and
not
to
stumble
because
they
thought
that
if
they
did
such
things
at
that
time
they
would
continue
to
do
so
for
ever
persons
born
on
any
of
these
days
were
deemed
unfortunate
destined
to
fail
in
their
undertakings
and
to
live
in
wretchedness
and
poverty
all
their
time
on
earth
the
mayas
of
yucatan
employed
a
calendar
like
that
of
the
aztecs
and
they
too
looked
upon
the
five
supplementary
days
at
the
end
of
the
year
as
unlucky
and
of
evil
omen
hence
they
gave
no
names
to
these
days
and
while
they
lasted
the
people
stayed
for
the
most
part
at
home
they
neither
washed
themselves
nor
combed
their
hair
nor
loused
each
other
and
they
did
no
servile
or
fatiguing
work
lest
some
evil
should
befall
them
the
ancient
egyptians
like
the
aztecs
considered
a
year
to
consist
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
ordinary
days
divided
into
months
and
eked
out
with
five
supplementary
days
so
as
to
bring
the
total
number
of
days
in
the
year
up
to
three
hundred
and
but
whereas
the
aztecs
divided
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
ordinary
days
into
eighteen
arbitrary
divisions
or
months
of
twenty
days
each
the
egyptians
keeping
much
closer
to
the
natural
periods
marked
by
the
phases
of
the
moon
divided
these
days
into
twelve
months
of
thirty
days
each
this
mode
of
regulating
the
calendar
appears
to
be
exceedingly
ancient
in
egypt
and
may
even
date
from
the
prehistoric
period
for
the
five
days
over
and
above
the
year
duaït
hiru
are
expressly
mentioned
in
the
texts
of
the
pyramids
the
myth
told
to
explain
their
origin
was
as
follows
once
on
a
time
the
keb
lay
secretly
with
the
nut
and
the
ra
in
his
anger
cursed
the
goddess
saying
that
she
should
give
birth
to
her
offspring
neither
in
any
month
nor
in
any
year
he
thought
no
doubt
by
this
imprecation
to
prevent
her
from
bringing
forth
the
fruit
of
her
womb
but
he
was
outwitted
by
the
wily
thoth
who
engaged
the
goddess
of
the
moon
in
a
game
of
draughts
and
having
won
the
game
took
as
a
forfeit
from
her
the
seventieth
part
of
every
day
in
the
year
and
out
of
the
fractions
thus
abstracted
he
made
up
five
new
days
which
he
added
to
the
old
year
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
days
as
these
days
formed
no
part
either
of
a
month
or
of
a
year
the
goddess
nut
might
be
delivered
in
them
without
rendering
the
s
curse
void
and
of
no
effect
accordingly
she
bore
osiris
on
the
first
of
the
days
horus
on
the
second
set
or
typhon
on
the
third
isis
on
the
fourth
and
nephthys
on
the
fifth
of
these
five
supplementary
or
intercalary
days
the
third
as
the
birthday
of
the
evil
deity
set
or
typhon
was
deemed
unlucky
and
the
egyptian
kings
neither
transacted
business
on
it
nor
attended
to
their
persons
till
nightfall
thus
it
appears
that
the
ancient
egyptians
regarded
the
five
supplementary
or
intercalary
days
as
belonging
neither
to
a
month
nor
to
a
year
but
as
standing
outside
of
both
and
forming
an
extraordinary
period
quite
apart
and
distinct
from
the
ordinary
course
of
time
it
is
probable
though
we
can
not
prove
it
that
in
all
countries
intercalary
days
or
months
have
been
so
considered
by
the
primitive
astronomers
who
first
observed
the
discrepancy
between
solar
and
lunar
time
and
attempted
to
reconcile
it
by
the
expedient
of
intercalation
thus
we
infer
with
some
probability
that
the
sacred
twelve
days
or
nights
at
midwinter
derive
their
peculiar
character
in
popular
custom
and
superstition
from
the
circumstance
that
they
were
originally
an
intercalary
period
inserted
annually
at
the
end
of
a
lunar
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
for
the
purpose
of
equating
it
to
a
solar
year
reckoned
at
three
hundred
and
days
however
there
are
grounds
for
thinking
that
at
a
very
early
time
the
aryan
peoples
sought
to
correct
their
lunar
year
not
by
inserting
twelve
supplementary
days
every
year
but
by
allowing
the
annual
deficiency
to
accumulate
for
several
years
and
then
supplying
it
by
a
whole
intercalary
month
in
india
the
aryans
of
the
vedic
age
appear
to
have
adopted
a
year
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
days
divided
into
twelve
months
of
thirty
days
each
and
to
have
remedied
the
annual
deficiency
of
five
days
by
intercalating
a
whole
month
of
thirty
days
every
fifth
year
thus
regulating
their
calendar
according
to
a
five
years
cycle
the
celts
of
gaul
as
we
learn
from
the
coligny
calendar
also
adopted
a
five
years
cycle
but
they
managed
it
differently
they
retained
the
old
lunar
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
divided
into
twelve
months
six
of
thirty
days
and
six
of
days
but
instead
of
intercalating
twelve
days
every
year
to
restore
the
balance
between
lunar
and
solar
time
they
intercalated
a
month
of
thirty
days
every
two
and
a
half
years
so
that
in
each
cycle
of
five
years
the
total
number
of
intercalary
days
was
sixty
which
was
equivalent
to
intercalating
twelve
days
annually
thus
the
result
at
the
end
of
each
cycle
of
five
years
was
precisely
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
if
they
had
followed
the
old
system
of
annual
intercalation
why
they
abandoned
the
simple
and
obvious
expedient
of
annually
intercalating
twelve
days
and
adopted
instead
the
more
recondite
system
of
intercalating
a
month
of
thirty
days
every
two
and
a
half
years
is
not
plain
it
may
be
that
religious
or
political
motives
unknown
to
us
concurred
with
practical
considerations
to
recommend
the
change
one
result
of
the
reform
would
be
the
abolition
of
the
temporary
king
who
if
i
am
right
used
to
bear
a
somewhat
tumultuary
sway
over
the
community
during
the
saturnalia
of
the
twelve
days
perhaps
the
annually
recurring
disorders
which
attended
that
period
of
license
were
not
the
least
urgent
of
the
reasons
which
moved
the
rulers
to
strike
the
twelve
intercalary
days
out
of
the
year
and
to
replace
them
by
an
intercalary
month
at
longer
intervals
however
that
may
be
the
equivalence
of
the
new
intercalary
month
to
the
old
intercalary
twelve
days
multiplied
by
two
and
a
half
is
strongly
suggested
by
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
coligny
calendar
for
in
it
the
thirty
days
of
the
intercalary
month
which
bore
the
name
of
ciallos
are
named
after
the
ordinary
twelve
months
of
the
year
thus
the
first
day
of
the
intercalary
month
is
called
samon
which
is
the
name
of
the
first
month
of
the
year
the
second
day
of
the
month
is
called
dumannos
which
is
the
name
of
the
second
month
of
the
year
the
third
day
of
the
month
is
called
rivros
which
is
the
name
of
the
third
month
of
the
year
the
fourth
day
of
the
month
is
called
anacan
which
is
the
name
of
the
fourth
month
of
the
year
and
so
on
with
all
the
rest
so
that
the
thirty
days
of
the
intercalary
month
bear
the
names
of
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
repeated
two
and
a
half
times
this
seems
to
shew
that
just
as
our
modern
peasants
regard
the
twelve
days
as
representing
each
a
month
of
the
year
in
their
chronological
order
so
the
old
celts
of
gaul
who
drew
up
the
coligny
calendar
regarded
the
thirty
days
of
the
intercalary
month
as
representing
the
thirty
ordinary
months
which
were
to
follow
it
till
the
next
intercalation
took
place
and
we
may
conjecture
that
just
as
our
modern
peasants
still
draw
omens
from
the
twelve
days
for
the
twelve
succeeding
months
so
the
old
celts
drew
omens
from
the
thirty
days
of
the
intercalary
month
for
the
thirty
months
of
the
two
and
a
half
succeeding
years
indeed
we
may
suppose
that
the
reformers
of
the
calendar
transferred
or
attempted
to
transfer
to
the
new
intercalary
month
the
whole
of
the
quaint
customs
and
superstitions
which
from
time
immemorial
had
clustered
round
the
twelve
intercalary
days
of
the
old
year
thus
like
the
old
twelve
days
of
midwinter
the
thirty
days
of
the
new
intercalary
month
may
have
formed
an
interregnum
or
break
in
the
ordinary
course
of
government
a
tumultuary
period
of
general
license
during
which
the
ordinary
rules
of
law
and
morality
were
suspended
and
the
direction
of
affairs
committed
to
a
temporary
and
more
or
less
farcical
ruler
or
king
of
the
bean
who
may
possibly
have
had
to
pay
with
his
life
for
his
brief
reign
of
thirty
days
the
floating
traditions
of
such
merry
monarchs
and
of
the
careless
life
under
them
may
have
crystallized
in
after
ages
into
the
legend
of
saturn
and
the
golden
age
if
that
was
i
put
forward
the
hypothesis
for
no
more
than
a
web
of
conjectures
woven
from
the
gossamer
threads
of
popular
can
understand
why
the
twelve
days
intercalated
every
year
in
the
old
calendar
should
have
survived
to
the
present
day
in
the
memory
of
the
people
whereas
the
thirty
days
intercalated
every
two
and
a
half
years
in
the
new
calendar
have
long
been
forgotten
it
is
the
simplest
ideas
that
live
longest
in
the
simple
minds
of
the
peasantry
and
since
the
intercalation
of
twelve
days
in
every
year
to
allow
the
lagging
moon
to
keep
pace
with
the
longer
stride
of
the
sun
is
certainly
an
easier
and
more
obvious
expedient
than
to
wait
for
two
and
a
half
years
till
he
has
outrun
her
by
thirty
days
we
need
not
wonder
that
this
ancient
mode
of
harmonizing
lunar
and
solar
time
should
have
lingered
in
the
recollection
and
in
the
usages
of
the
people
ages
after
the
more
roundabout
method
which
reflective
minds
had
devised
for
accomplishing
the
same
end
had
faded
alike
from
the
memory
of
the
peasant
and
the
page
of
the
historian
the
saturnalia
and
lent
as
the
carnival
is
always
held
on
the
last
three
days
before
the
beginning
of
lent
its
date
shifts
somewhat
from
year
to
year
but
it
invariably
falls
either
in
february
or
march
hence
it
does
not
coincide
with
the
date
of
the
saturnalia
which
within
historical
times
seems
to
have
been
always
celebrated
in
december
even
in
the
old
days
before
caesar
s
reform
of
the
calendar
when
the
roman
year
ended
with
february
instead
of
december
yet
if
the
saturnalia
like
many
other
seasons
of
license
was
originally
celebrated
as
a
sort
of
public
purification
at
the
end
of
the
old
year
or
the
beginning
of
the
new
one
it
may
at
a
still
more
remote
period
when
the
roman
year
began
with
march
have
been
regularly
held
either
in
february
or
march
and
therefore
at
approximately
the
same
date
as
the
modern
carnival
so
strong
and
persistent
are
the
conservative
instincts
of
the
peasantry
in
respect
to
old
custom
that
it
would
be
no
matter
for
surprise
if
in
rural
districts
of
italy
the
ancient
festival
continued
to
be
celebrated
at
the
ancient
time
long
after
the
official
celebration
of
the
saturnalia
in
the
towns
had
been
shifted
from
february
to
december
latin
christianity
which
struck
at
the
root
of
official
or
civic
paganism
has
always
been
tolerant
of
its
rustic
cousins
the
popular
festivals
and
ceremonies
which
unaffected
by
political
and
religious
revolutions
by
the
passing
of
empires
and
of
gods
have
been
carried
on
by
the
people
with
but
little
change
from
time
immemorial
and
represent
in
fact
the
original
stock
from
which
the
state
religions
of
classical
antiquity
were
comparatively
late
offshoots
thus
it
may
very
well
have
come
about
that
while
the
new
faith
stamped
out
the
saturnalia
in
the
towns
it
suffered
the
original
festival
disguised
by
a
difference
of
date
to
linger
unmolested
in
the
country
and
so
the
old
feast
of
saturn
under
the
modern
name
of
the
carnival
has
reconquered
the
cities
and
goes
on
merrily
under
the
eye
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
catholic
church
the
opinion
that
the
saturnalia
originally
fell
in
february
or
the
beginning
of
march
receives
some
support
from
the
circumstance
that
the
festival
of
the
matronalia
at
which
mistresses
feasted
their
slaves
just
as
masters
did
theirs
at
the
saturnalia
always
continued
to
be
held
on
the
first
of
march
even
when
the
roman
year
began
with
january
it
is
further
not
a
little
recommended
by
the
consideration
that
this
date
would
be
eminently
appropriate
for
the
festival
of
saturn
the
old
italian
god
of
sowing
and
planting
it
has
always
been
a
puzzle
to
explain
why
such
a
festival
should
have
been
held
at
midwinter
but
on
the
present
hypothesis
the
mystery
vanishes
with
the
italian
farmer
february
and
march
were
the
great
season
of
the
spring
sowing
and
planting
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
the
husbandman
should
inaugurate
the
season
with
the
worship
of
the
deity
to
whom
he
ascribed
the
function
of
quickening
the
seed
it
is
no
small
confirmation
of
this
theory
that
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
namely
shrove
tuesday
is
still
or
was
down
to
recent
times
the
customary
season
in
central
europe
for
promoting
the
growth
of
the
crops
by
means
of
leaps
and
dances
the
custom
fits
in
very
well
with
the
view
which
derives
the
carnival
from
an
old
festival
of
sowing
such
as
the
saturnalia
probably
was
in
its
origin
further
the
orgiastic
character
of
the
festival
is
readily
explained
by
the
help
of
facts
which
met
us
in
a
former
part
of
our
investigation
we
have
seen
that
between
the
sower
and
the
seed
there
is
commonly
supposed
to
exist
a
sympathetic
connexion
of
such
a
nature
that
his
conduct
directly
affects
and
can
promote
or
retard
the
growth
of
the
crops
what
wonder
then
if
the
simple
husbandman
imagined
that
by
cramming
his
belly
by
swilling
and
guzzling
just
before
he
proceeded
to
sow
his
fields
he
thereby
imparted
additional
vigour
to
the
seed
but
while
his
crude
philosophy
may
thus
have
painted
gluttony
and
intoxication
in
the
agreeable
colours
of
duties
which
he
owed
to
himself
to
his
family
and
to
the
commonwealth
it
is
possible
that
the
zest
with
which
he
acquitted
himself
of
his
obligations
may
have
been
whetted
by
a
less
comfortable
reflection
in
modern
times
the
indulgence
of
the
carnival
is
immediately
followed
by
the
abstinence
of
lent
and
if
the
carnival
is
the
direct
descendant
of
the
saturnalia
may
not
lent
in
like
manner
be
merely
the
continuation
under
a
thin
disguise
of
a
period
of
temperance
which
was
annually
observed
from
superstitious
motives
by
italian
farmers
long
before
the
christian
era
direct
evidence
of
this
so
far
as
i
am
aware
is
not
forthcoming
but
we
have
seen
that
a
practice
of
abstinence
from
fleshly
lusts
has
been
observed
by
various
peoples
as
a
sympathetic
charm
to
foster
the
growth
of
the
seed
and
such
an
observance
would
be
an
appropriate
sequel
to
the
saturnalia
if
that
festival
was
indeed
as
i
conjecture
it
to
have
been
originally
held
in
spring
as
a
religious
or
magical
preparation
for
sowing
and
planting
when
we
consider
how
widely
diffused
is
the
belief
in
the
sympathetic
influence
which
human
conduct
and
especially
the
intercourse
of
the
sexes
exerts
on
the
fruits
of
the
earth
we
may
be
allowed
to
conjecture
that
the
lenten
fast
with
the
rule
of
continence
which
is
recommended
if
not
strictly
enjoined
by
the
catholic
and
coptic
churches
during
that
season
was
in
its
origin
intended
not
so
much
to
commemorate
the
sufferings
of
a
dying
god
as
to
foster
the
growth
of
the
seed
which
in
the
bleak
days
of
early
spring
the
husbandman
commits
with
anxious
care
and
misgiving
to
the
bosom
of
the
naked
earth
ecclesiastical
historians
have
been
puzzled
to
say
why
after
much
hesitation
and
great
diversity
of
usage
in
different
places
the
christian
church
finally
adopted
forty
days
as
the
proper
period
for
the
mournful
celebration
of
lent
perhaps
in
coming
to
this
decision
the
authorities
were
guided
as
so
often
by
a
regard
for
an
existing
pagan
celebration
of
similar
character
and
duration
which
they
hoped
by
a
change
of
name
to
convert
into
a
christian
solemnity
such
a
heathen
lent
they
may
have
found
to
hand
in
the
rites
of
persephone
the
greek
goddess
of
the
corn
whose
image
carved
out
of
a
tree
was
annually
brought
into
the
cities
and
mourned
for
forty
nights
after
which
it
was
burned
the
time
of
year
when
these
lamentations
took
place
is
not
mentioned
by
the
old
christian
writer
who
records
them
but
they
would
fall
most
appropriately
at
the
season
when
the
seed
was
sown
or
in
mythical
language
when
the
was
buried
which
in
ancient
italy
as
we
saw
was
done
above
all
in
the
months
of
february
and
march
we
know
that
at
the
time
of
the
autumnal
sowing
greek
women
held
a
sad
and
serious
festival
because
the
persephone
or
the
maiden
as
they
called
her
then
went
down
into
the
earth
with
the
sown
grain
and
demeter
fondly
mourned
her
daughter
s
absence
hence
in
sympathy
with
the
sorrowful
mother
the
women
likewise
mourned
and
observed
a
solemn
fast
and
abstained
from
the
marriage
bed
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
suppose
that
they
practised
similar
rules
of
mourning
and
abstinence
for
a
like
reason
at
the
time
of
the
spring
sowing
and
that
the
ancient
ritual
survives
in
the
modern
lent
which
preserves
the
memory
of
the
though
it
has
substituted
a
dead
son
for
a
dead
daughter
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
burma
a
similar
fast
which
english
writers
call
the
buddhist
lent
is
observed
for
three
months
every
year
while
the
ploughing
and
sowing
of
the
fields
go
forward
and
the
custom
is
believed
to
be
far
older
than
buddhism
which
has
merely
given
it
a
superficial
tinge
like
the
veneer
of
christianity
which
if
i
am
right
has
overlaid
an
old
heathen
observance
in
lent
this
burmese
lent
we
are
told
covers
the
rainy
season
from
the
full
moon
of
july
to
the
full
moon
of
october
this
is
the
time
to
plough
this
is
the
time
to
sow
on
the
villagers
exertions
in
these
months
depends
all
their
maintenance
for
the
rest
of
the
year
every
man
every
woman
every
child
has
hard
work
of
some
kind
or
another
and
so
what
with
the
difficulties
of
travelling
what
with
the
work
there
is
to
do
and
what
with
the
custom
of
lent
every
one
stays
at
home
it
is
the
time
for
prayer
for
fasting
for
improving
the
soul
many
men
during
these
months
will
live
even
as
the
monks
live
will
eat
but
before
midday
will
abstain
from
tobacco
there
are
no
plays
during
lent
and
there
are
no
marriages
it
is
the
time
for
preparing
the
land
for
the
crop
it
is
the
time
for
preparing
the
soul
for
eternity
the
congregations
on
the
sundays
will
be
far
greater
at
this
time
than
at
any
other
there
will
be
more
thought
of
the
serious
things
of
saturnalia
in
ancient
greece
beyond
the
limits
of
italy
festivals
of
the
same
general
character
as
the
saturnalia
appear
to
have
been
held
over
a
considerable
area
of
the
ancient
world
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
saturnalia
as
we
saw
was
an
inversion
of
social
ranks
masters
changing
places
with
their
slaves
and
waiting
upon
them
while
slaves
were
indulged
with
a
semblance
not
merely
of
freedom
but
even
of
power
and
office
in
various
parts
of
greece
the
same
hollow
show
of
granting
liberty
to
slaves
was
made
at
certain
festivals
thus
at
a
cretan
festival
of
hermes
the
servants
feasted
and
their
masters
waited
upon
them
in
the
month
of
geraestius
the
troezenians
observed
a
certain
solemnity
lasting
many
days
on
one
of
which
the
slaves
played
at
dice
with
the
citizens
and
were
treated
to
a
banquet
by
their
lords
the
thessalians
held
a
great
festival
called
peloria
which
baton
of
sinope
identified
with
the
saturnalia
and
of
which
the
antiquity
is
vouched
for
by
a
tradition
that
it
originated
with
the
pelasgians
at
this
festival
sacrifices
were
offered
to
pelorian
zeus
tables
splendidly
adorned
were
set
out
all
strangers
were
invited
to
the
feast
all
prisoners
released
and
the
slaves
sat
down
to
the
banquet
enjoyed
full
freedom
of
speech
and
were
served
by
their
masters
but
the
greek
festival
which
appears
to
have
corresponded
most
closely
to
the
italian
saturnalia
was
the
cronia
or
festival
of
cronus
a
god
whose
barbarous
myth
and
cruel
ritual
clearly
belong
to
a
very
early
stratum
of
greek
religion
and
who
was
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
antiquity
identified
with
saturn
we
are
told
that
his
festival
was
celebrated
in
most
parts
of
greece
but
especially
at
athens
where
the
old
god
and
his
wife
rhea
had
a
shrine
near
the
stately
but
far
more
modern
temple
of
olympian
zeus
a
joyous
feast
at
which
masters
and
slaves
sat
down
together
formed
a
leading
feature
of
the
solemnity
at
athens
the
festival
fell
in
the
height
of
summer
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
month
hecatombaeon
formerly
called
the
month
of
cronus
which
answered
nearly
to
july
and
tradition
ran
that
cecrops
the
first
king
of
attica
had
founded
an
altar
in
honour
of
cronus
and
rhea
and
had
ordained
that
master
and
man
should
share
a
common
meal
when
the
harvest
was
got
in
yet
there
are
indications
that
at
athens
the
cronia
may
once
have
been
a
spring
festival
for
a
cake
with
twelve
knobs
which
perhaps
referred
to
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
was
offered
to
cronus
by
the
athenians
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
elaphebolion
which
corresponded
roughly
to
march
and
there
are
traces
of
a
license
accorded
to
slaves
at
the
dionysiac
festival
of
the
opening
of
the
which
fell
on
the
eleventh
day
of
the
preceding
month
anthesterion
at
olympia
the
festival
of
cronus
undoubtedly
occurred
in
spring
for
here
a
low
but
steep
hill
now
covered
with
a
tangled
growth
of
dark
and
firs
was
sacred
to
him
and
on
its
top
certain
magistrates
who
bore
the
title
of
kings
offered
sacrifice
to
the
old
god
at
the
vernal
equinox
in
the
elean
month
elaphius
in
this
last
ceremony
which
probably
went
on
year
by
year
long
before
the
upstart
zeus
had
a
temple
built
for
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
are
two
points
of
special
interest
first
the
date
of
the
ceremony
and
second
the
title
of
the
celebrants
first
as
to
the
date
the
spring
equinox
or
the
of
march
must
have
fallen
so
near
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
athenian
month
elaphebolion
that
we
may
fairly
ask
whether
the
athenian
custom
of
offering
a
cake
to
cronus
on
that
day
may
not
also
have
been
an
equinoctial
ceremony
in
the
second
place
the
title
of
kings
borne
by
the
magistrates
who
sacrificed
to
cronus
renders
it
probable
that
like
magistrates
with
similar
titles
elsewhere
in
republican
greece
they
were
the
lineal
descendants
of
sacred
kings
whom
the
superstition
of
their
subjects
invested
with
the
attributes
of
divinity
if
that
was
so
it
would
be
natural
enough
that
one
of
these
nominal
kings
should
pose
as
the
god
cronus
in
person
for
like
his
italian
counterpart
saturn
the
greek
cronus
was
believed
to
have
been
a
king
who
reigned
in
heaven
or
on
earth
during
the
blissful
golden
age
when
men
passed
their
days
like
gods
without
toil
or
sorrow
when
life
was
a
long
round
of
festivity
and
death
came
like
sleep
sudden
but
gentle
announced
by
none
of
his
sad
forerunners
the
ailments
and
infirmities
of
age
thus
the
analogy
of
the
olympian
cronia
probably
one
of
the
oldest
of
greek
festivals
to
the
italian
saturnalia
would
be
very
close
if
originally
as
i
conjecture
the
saturnalia
fell
in
spring
and
saturn
was
personated
at
it
as
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
by
a
man
dressed
as
a
king
may
we
go
a
step
further
and
suppose
that
just
as
the
man
who
acted
king
saturn
at
the
saturnalia
was
formerly
slain
in
that
character
so
one
of
the
kings
who
celebrated
the
cronia
at
olympia
not
only
played
the
part
of
cronus
but
was
sacrificed
as
god
and
victim
in
one
on
the
top
of
the
hill
cronus
certainly
bore
a
sinister
reputation
in
antiquity
he
passed
for
an
unnatural
parent
who
had
devoured
his
own
offspring
and
he
was
regularly
identified
by
the
greeks
with
the
cruel
semitic
baals
who
delighted
in
the
sacrifice
of
human
victims
especially
of
children
a
legend
which
savours
strongly
of
infant
sacrifice
is
reported
of
a
shrine
that
stood
at
the
very
foot
of
the
god
s
own
hill
at
olympia
and
a
quite
unambiguous
story
was
told
of
the
sacrifice
of
a
babe
to
lycaean
zeus
on
mount
lycaeus
in
arcadia
where
the
worship
of
zeus
was
probably
nothing
but
a
continuation
under
a
new
name
of
the
old
worship
of
cronus
and
where
human
victims
appear
to
have
been
regularly
offered
down
to
the
christian
era
the
rhodians
annually
sacrificed
a
man
to
cronus
in
the
month
metageitnion
at
a
later
time
they
kept
a
condemned
criminal
in
prison
till
the
festival
of
the
cronia
was
come
then
led
him
forth
outside
the
gates
made
him
drunk
with
wine
and
cut
his
throat
with
the
parallel
of
the
saturnalia
before
our
eyes
we
may
surmise
that
the
victim
who
thus
ended
his
life
in
a
state
of
intoxication
at
the
cronia
perhaps
personated
king
cronus
himself
the
god
who
reigned
in
the
happy
days
of
old
when
men
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
eat
and
drink
and
make
merry
at
least
the
rhodian
custom
lends
some
countenance
to
the
conjecture
that
formerly
a
human
victim
may
have
figured
at
the
sacrifice
which
the
kings
offered
to
cronus
on
his
hill
at
olympia
in
this
connexion
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
we
have
already
found
examples
of
a
custom
of
sacrificing
the
scions
of
royal
houses
in
ancient
greece
if
the
god
to
whom
or
perhaps
rather
in
whose
character
the
princes
were
sacrificed
was
cronus
it
would
be
natural
that
the
greeks
of
a
later
age
should
identify
him
with
baal
or
moloch
to
whom
in
like
manner
semitic
kings
offered
up
their
children
the
laphystian
zeus
of
thessaly
and
boeotia
whom
tradition
associated
with
these
human
sacrifices
was
probably
like
the
lycaean
zeus
of
arcadia
nothing
but
the
aboriginal
deity
commonly
known
as
cronus
whose
gloomy
rites
the
greek
invaders
suffered
the
priests
of
the
vanquished
race
to
continue
after
the
ancient
manner
while
they
quieted
their
scruples
of
conscience
or
satisfied
their
pride
as
conquerors
by
investing
the
bloodthirsty
old
savage
with
the
name
if
not
with
the
character
of
their
own
milder
deity
the
humane
and
gracious
zeus
saturnalia
in
western
asia
when
we
pass
from
europe
to
western
asia
from
ancient
greece
to
ancient
babylon
and
the
regions
where
babylonian
influence
penetrated
we
are
still
met
with
festivals
which
bear
the
closest
resemblance
to
the
oldest
form
of
the
italian
saturnalia
the
reader
may
remember
the
festival
of
the
sacaea
on
which
i
had
occasion
to
touch
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
it
was
held
at
babylon
during
five
days
of
the
month
lous
beginning
with
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
month
during
its
continuance
just
as
at
the
saturnalia
masters
and
servants
changed
places
the
servants
issuing
orders
and
the
masters
obeying
them
and
in
each
house
one
of
the
servants
dressed
as
a
king
and
bearing
the
title
of
zoganes
bore
rule
over
the
household
further
just
as
at
the
saturnalia
in
its
original
form
a
man
was
dressed
as
king
saturn
in
royal
robes
allowed
to
indulge
his
passions
and
caprices
to
the
full
and
then
put
to
death
so
at
the
sacaea
a
condemned
prisoner
who
probably
also
bore
for
the
time
being
the
title
of
zoganes
was
arrayed
in
the
king
s
attire
and
suffered
to
play
the
despot
to
use
the
king
s
concubines
and
to
give
himself
up
to
feasting
and
debauchery
without
restraint
only
however
in
the
end
to
be
stript
of
his
borrowed
finery
scourged
and
hanged
or
crucified
from
strabo
we
learn
that
this
asiatic
counterpart
of
the
saturnalia
was
celebrated
in
asia
minor
wherever
the
worship
of
the
persian
goddess
anaitis
had
established
itself
he
describes
it
as
a
bacchic
orgy
at
which
the
revellers
were
disguised
as
scythians
and
men
and
women
drank
and
dallied
together
by
day
and
night
as
the
worship
of
anaitis
though
of
persian
origin
appears
to
have
been
deeply
leavened
with
coarse
elements
which
it
derived
from
the
religion
of
babylon
we
may
perhaps
regard
mesopotamia
as
the
original
home
from
which
the
sacaean
festival
spread
westward
into
other
parts
of
asia
minor
now
the
sacaean
festival
described
by
the
babylonian
priest
berosus
in
the
first
book
of
his
history
of
babylon
has
been
plausibly
identified
with
the
great
babylonian
festival
of
the
new
year
called
zakmuk
zagmuk
zakmuku
or
zagmuku
which
has
become
known
to
us
in
recent
times
through
inscriptions
the
babylonian
year
began
with
the
spring
month
of
nisan
which
seems
to
have
covered
the
second
half
of
march
and
the
first
half
of
april
thus
the
new
year
festival
which
occupied
at
least
the
first
eleven
days
of
nisan
probably
included
the
spring
equinox
it
was
held
in
honour
of
marduk
or
merodach
the
chief
god
of
babylon
whose
great
temple
of
esagila
in
the
city
formed
the
religious
centre
of
the
solemnity
for
here
in
a
splendid
chamber
of
the
vast
edifice
all
the
gods
were
believed
to
assemble
at
this
season
under
the
presidency
of
marduk
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
fates
for
the
new
year
especially
the
fate
of
the
king
s
life
on
this
occasion
the
king
of
babylon
was
bound
annually
to
renew
his
regal
power
by
grasping
the
hands
of
the
image
of
marduk
in
his
temple
as
if
to
signify
that
he
received
the
kingdom
directly
from
the
deity
and
was
unable
without
the
divine
assistance
and
authority
to
retain
it
for
more
than
a
year
unless
he
thus
formally
reinstated
himself
on
the
throne
once
a
year
the
king
ceased
to
reign
legitimately
when
babylonia
was
conquered
by
assyria
the
assyrian
monarchs
themselves
used
to
come
to
babylon
and
perform
the
ceremony
of
grasping
the
god
s
hands
in
order
to
establish
by
this
solemn
act
their
title
to
the
kingdom
which
they
had
won
for
themselves
by
the
sword
until
they
had
done
so
they
were
not
recognized
as
kings
by
their
babylonian
subjects
some
of
them
indeed
found
the
ceremony
either
so
burdensome
or
so
humiliating
to
their
pride
as
conquerors
that
rather
than
perform
it
they
renounced
the
title
of
king
of
babylon
altogether
and
contented
themselves
with
the
more
modest
title
of
regent
another
notable
feature
of
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
new
year
appears
to
have
been
a
ceremonial
marriage
of
the
god
marduk
for
in
a
hymn
relating
to
the
solemnity
it
is
said
of
the
deity
that
he
hastened
to
his
the
festival
was
of
hoar
antiquity
for
it
was
known
to
gudea
an
old
king
of
southern
babylonia
who
flourished
between
two
and
three
thousand
years
before
the
beginning
of
our
era
and
it
is
mentioned
in
an
early
account
of
the
great
flood
at
a
much
later
period
it
is
repeatedly
referred
to
by
king
nebuchadnezzar
and
his
successors
nebuchadnezzar
records
how
he
built
of
bricks
and
bitumen
a
chapel
or
altar
a
thing
of
joy
and
rejoicing
for
the
great
festival
of
marduk
the
lord
of
the
gods
and
we
read
of
the
rich
and
abundant
offerings
which
were
made
by
the
high
priest
at
this
time
unfortunately
the
notices
of
this
babylonian
festival
of
the
new
year
which
have
come
down
to
us
deal
chiefly
with
its
mythical
aspect
and
throw
little
light
on
the
mode
of
its
celebration
hence
its
identity
with
the
sacaea
must
remain
for
the
present
a
more
or
less
probable
hypothesis
in
favour
of
the
hypothesis
may
be
alleged
in
the
first
place
the
resemblance
of
the
names
sacaea
and
zoganes
to
zakmuk
or
zagmuku
if
that
was
the
real
pronunciation
of
the
name
and
in
the
second
place
the
very
significant
statement
that
the
fate
of
the
king
s
life
was
supposed
to
be
determined
by
the
gods
under
the
presidency
of
marduk
at
the
zakmuk
or
new
year
s
festival
when
we
remember
that
the
central
feature
of
the
sacaea
appears
to
have
been
the
saving
of
the
king
s
life
for
another
year
by
the
vicarious
sacrifice
of
a
criminal
on
the
cross
or
the
gallows
we
can
understand
that
the
season
was
a
critical
one
for
the
king
and
that
it
may
well
have
been
regarded
as
determining
his
fate
for
the
ensuing
twelve
months
the
annual
ceremony
of
renewing
the
king
s
power
by
contact
with
the
god
s
image
which
formed
a
leading
feature
of
the
zakmuk
festival
would
be
very
appropriately
performed
immediately
after
the
execution
or
sacrifice
of
the
temporary
king
who
died
in
the
room
of
the
real
monarch
a
difficulty
however
in
the
way
of
identifying
the
sacaea
with
the
zakmuk
arises
from
the
statement
of
berosus
that
the
sacaea
fell
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
lous
which
was
the
tenth
month
of
the
calendar
and
appears
to
have
nearly
coincided
with
july
thus
if
the
sacaea
occurred
in
july
and
the
zakmuk
in
march
the
theory
of
their
identity
could
not
be
maintained
but
the
dating
of
the
months
of
the
calendar
is
a
matter
of
some
uncertainty
the
month
of
lous
in
particular
appears
to
have
fallen
at
different
times
of
the
year
in
different
places
and
until
we
have
ascertained
beyond
the
reach
of
doubt
when
lous
fell
at
babylon
in
the
time
of
berosus
it
would
be
premature
to
allow
much
weight
to
the
seeming
discrepancy
in
the
dates
of
the
two
festivals
at
all
events
whether
the
festivals
were
the
same
or
different
we
are
confronted
with
difficulties
which
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
may
be
pronounced
insoluble
if
the
festivals
were
the
same
we
can
not
explain
their
apparent
difference
of
date
if
they
were
different
we
can
not
explain
their
apparent
similarity
of
character
in
what
follows
i
shall
with
some
eminent
oriental
scholars
provisionally
assume
the
identity
of
zakmuk
and
sacaea
but
i
would
ask
the
reader
to
bear
clearly
in
mind
that
the
hypothesis
leaves
the
apparent
discrepancy
of
their
dates
unexplained
towards
a
solution
of
the
problem
i
can
only
suggest
conjecturally
either
that
the
date
of
the
festival
had
been
for
some
reason
shifted
in
the
time
of
berosus
or
that
two
different
festivals
of
the
same
type
may
have
been
held
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
one
in
spring
and
one
in
summer
perhaps
by
two
distinct
but
kindred
tribes
who
retained
their
separate
religious
rites
after
they
had
coalesced
in
the
babylonian
empire
both
conjectures
might
be
supported
by
analogies
on
the
one
hand
for
example
in
the
jewish
calendar
new
year
s
day
was
shifted
under
babylonian
influence
from
autumn
to
spring
and
in
a
later
part
of
this
work
we
shall
see
that
the
chinese
festival
of
new
fire
at
first
celebrated
in
spring
was
afterwards
shifted
to
the
summer
solstice
only
however
to
be
brought
back
at
a
later
time
to
its
original
date
on
the
other
hand
the
popular
festivals
of
our
european
peasantry
afford
many
examples
of
rites
which
appear
to
be
similar
in
character
though
they
fall
at
different
times
of
the
year
such
for
instance
are
the
ceremonies
concerned
with
vegetation
on
may
day
whitsuntide
and
midsummer
day
and
the
fire
festivals
which
are
distributed
at
still
wider
intervals
throughout
the
months
similarly
in
ancient
italy
the
agricultural
festival
of
the
ambarvalia
was
celebrated
by
italian
farmers
at
different
dates
in
different
places
these
cases
may
warn
us
against
the
danger
of
hastily
inferring
an
essential
difference
between
zakmuk
and
sacaea
on
the
ground
of
a
real
or
apparent
difference
in
their
dates
a
fresh
and
powerful
argument
in
favour
of
the
identity
of
the
two
festivals
is
furnished
by
the
connexion
which
has
been
traced
between
both
of
them
and
the
jewish
feast
of
purim
there
are
good
grounds
for
believing
that
purim
was
unknown
to
the
jews
until
after
the
exile
and
that
they
learned
to
observe
it
during
their
captivity
in
the
east
the
festival
is
first
mentioned
in
the
book
of
esther
which
by
the
majority
of
critics
is
assigned
to
the
fourth
or
third
century
and
which
certainly
can
not
be
older
than
the
persian
period
since
the
scene
of
the
narrative
is
laid
in
susa
at
the
court
of
a
persian
king
ahasuerus
whose
name
appears
to
be
the
hebrew
equivalent
of
xerxes
the
next
reference
to
purim
occurs
in
the
second
book
of
maccabees
a
work
written
probably
about
the
beginning
of
our
era
thus
from
the
absence
of
all
notice
of
purim
in
the
older
books
of
the
bible
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
the
festival
was
instituted
or
imported
at
a
comparatively
late
date
among
the
jews
the
same
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
book
of
esther
itself
which
was
manifestly
written
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
feast
and
to
suggest
motives
for
its
observance
for
according
to
the
author
of
the
book
the
festival
was
established
to
commemorate
the
deliverance
of
the
jews
from
a
great
danger
which
threatened
them
in
persia
under
the
reign
of
king
xerxes
thus
the
opinion
of
modern
scholars
that
the
feast
of
purim
as
celebrated
by
the
jews
was
of
late
date
and
oriental
origin
is
borne
out
by
the
tradition
of
the
jews
themselves
an
examination
of
that
tradition
and
the
mode
of
celebrating
the
feast
renders
it
probable
that
purim
is
nothing
but
a
more
or
less
disguised
form
of
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
sacaea
or
zakmuk
in
the
first
place
the
feast
of
purim
was
and
is
held
on
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
days
of
adar
the
last
month
of
the
jewish
year
which
corresponds
roughly
to
march
thus
the
date
agrees
nearly
though
not
exactly
with
the
date
of
the
babylonian
zakmuk
which
fell
a
fortnight
later
in
the
early
days
of
the
following
month
nisan
a
trace
of
the
original
celebration
of
purim
in
nisan
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
statement
that
they
cast
pur
that
is
the
lot
before
haman
in
nisan
the
first
month
of
the
year
it
has
been
suggested
with
some
plausibility
that
the
jews
may
have
shifted
the
date
of
purim
in
order
that
the
new
and
foreign
festival
might
not
clash
with
their
own
old
festival
of
the
passover
which
began
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
nisan
another
circumstance
which
speaks
at
once
for
the
alien
origin
of
purim
and
for
its
identity
with
zakmuk
is
its
name
the
author
of
the
book
of
esther
derives
the
name
purim
from
a
lot
but
no
such
word
with
this
signification
exists
in
hebrew
and
hence
we
are
driven
to
look
for
the
meaning
and
etymology
of
purim
in
some
other
language
a
specious
theory
is
that
the
name
was
derived
from
an
assyrian
word
an
assembly
and
referred
primarily
to
the
great
assembly
of
the
gods
which
as
we
have
seen
formed
a
chief
feature
of
the
festival
of
zakmuk
and
was
held
annually
in
the
temple
of
marduk
at
babylon
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
fates
or
lots
of
the
new
year
the
august
assembly
appears
to
have
been
occasionally
if
not
regularly
designated
by
the
very
name
on
this
hypothesis
the
traditional
jewish
explanation
of
the
name
purim
preserved
a
genuine
kernel
of
historical
truth
or
at
least
of
mythical
fancy
under
the
husk
of
a
verbal
error
for
the
name
if
this
derivation
of
it
is
correct
really
signified
not
the
lots
but
the
assembly
for
drawing
or
otherwise
determining
the
lots
another
explanation
which
has
been
offered
is
that
or
seems
to
be
an
old
assyrian
word
for
stone
and
that
therefore
it
is
possible
that
the
word
was
also
used
to
signify
lot
like
the
hebrew
גורל
lot
which
originally
no
doubt
meant
little
either
of
these
explanations
of
the
name
purim
by
tracing
it
back
to
the
new
year
assembly
of
the
gods
at
babylon
for
settling
the
lots
furnishes
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
traditional
association
of
purim
with
the
casting
of
association
all
the
more
remarkable
and
all
the
more
likely
to
be
ancient
because
there
is
nothing
to
justify
it
either
in
the
hebrew
language
or
in
the
jewish
mode
of
celebrating
the
festival
when
to
this
we
add
the
joyous
nay
extravagant
festivity
which
has
always
been
characteristic
of
purim
and
is
entirely
in
keeping
with
a
new
year
celebration
we
may
perhaps
be
thought
to
have
made
out
a
fairly
probable
case
for
holding
that
the
jewish
feast
is
derived
from
the
babylonian
new
year
festival
of
zakmuk
whether
the
jews
borrowed
the
feast
directly
from
the
babylonians
or
indirectly
through
the
persian
conquerors
of
babylon
is
a
question
which
deserves
to
be
considered
but
the
persian
colouring
of
the
book
of
esther
speaks
strongly
for
the
view
that
purim
came
to
israel
by
way
of
persia
or
at
all
events
from
babylon
under
persian
rule
and
this
view
is
confirmed
by
other
evidence
to
which
i
shall
have
to
ask
the
reader
s
attention
a
little
later
on
if
the
links
which
bind
purim
to
zakmuk
are
reasonably
strong
the
chain
of
evidence
which
connects
the
jewish
festival
with
the
sacaea
is
much
stronger
nor
is
this
surprising
when
we
remember
that
while
the
popular
mode
of
celebrating
zakmuk
is
unknown
we
possess
important
and
trustworthy
details
as
to
the
manner
of
holding
the
sacaea
we
have
seen
that
the
sacaea
was
a
wild
bacchanalian
revel
at
which
men
and
women
disguised
themselves
and
drank
and
played
together
in
a
fashion
that
was
more
gay
than
modest
now
this
is
or
used
to
be
precisely
the
nature
of
purim
the
two
days
of
the
festival
according
to
the
author
of
the
book
of
esther
were
to
be
kept
for
ever
as
days
of
feasting
and
gladness
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another
and
gifts
to
the
and
this
joyous
character
the
festival
seems
always
to
have
retained
the
author
of
a
tract
in
the
talmud
lays
it
down
as
a
rule
that
at
the
feast
of
purim
every
jew
is
bound
to
drink
until
he
can
not
distinguish
between
the
words
cursed
be
haman
and
blessed
be
mordecai
and
he
tells
how
on
one
occasion
a
certain
rabba
drank
so
deep
at
purim
that
he
murdered
a
rabbi
without
knowing
what
he
was
about
indeed
purim
has
been
described
as
the
jewish
bacchanalia
and
we
are
told
that
at
this
season
everything
is
lawful
which
can
contribute
to
the
mirth
and
gaiety
of
the
festival
writers
of
the
seventeenth
century
assert
that
during
the
two
days
and
especially
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
the
jews
did
nothing
but
feast
and
drink
to
repletion
play
dance
sing
and
make
merry
in
particular
they
disguised
themselves
men
and
women
exchanging
clothes
and
thus
attired
ran
about
like
mad
in
open
defiance
of
the
mosaic
law
which
expressly
forbids
men
to
dress
as
women
and
women
as
men
among
the
jews
of
frankfort
who
inhabited
the
squalid
but
quaint
and
picturesque
old
street
known
as
the
judengasse
which
many
of
us
still
remember
the
revelry
at
purim
ran
as
high
as
ever
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
gluttony
and
intoxication
began
punctually
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
and
went
on
until
the
whole
community
seemed
to
have
taken
leave
of
their
senses
they
ate
and
drank
they
frolicked
and
cut
capers
they
reeled
and
staggered
about
they
shrieked
yelled
stamped
clattered
and
broke
each
other
s
heads
with
wooden
hammers
till
the
blood
flowed
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
the
women
were
allowed
as
a
special
favour
to
open
their
latticed
window
and
look
into
the
men
s
synagogue
because
the
great
deliverance
of
the
jews
from
their
enemies
in
the
time
of
king
ahasuerus
was
said
to
have
been
effected
by
a
woman
a
feature
of
the
festival
which
should
not
be
overlooked
was
the
acting
of
the
story
of
esther
as
a
comedy
in
which
esther
ahasuerus
haman
mordecai
and
others
played
their
parts
after
a
fashion
that
sometimes
degenerated
from
farce
into
ribaldry
thus
on
the
whole
we
may
take
it
that
purim
has
always
been
a
saturnalia
and
therefore
corresponds
in
character
to
the
sacaea
as
that
festival
has
been
described
for
us
by
strabo
but
further
when
we
examine
the
narrative
which
professes
to
account
for
the
institution
of
purim
we
discover
in
it
not
only
the
strongest
traces
of
babylonian
origin
but
also
certain
singular
analogies
to
those
very
features
of
the
sacaean
festival
with
which
we
are
here
more
immediately
concerned
the
book
of
esther
turns
upon
the
fortunes
of
two
men
the
vizier
haman
and
the
despised
jew
mordecai
at
the
court
of
a
persian
king
mordecai
we
are
told
had
given
mortal
offence
to
the
vizier
who
accordingly
prepares
a
tall
gallows
on
which
he
hopes
to
see
his
enemy
hanged
while
he
himself
expects
to
receive
the
highest
mark
of
the
king
s
favour
by
being
allowed
to
wear
the
royal
crown
and
the
royal
robes
and
thus
attired
to
parade
the
streets
mounted
on
the
king
s
own
horse
and
attended
by
one
of
the
noblest
princes
who
should
proclaim
to
the
multitude
his
temporary
exaltation
and
glory
but
the
artful
intrigues
of
the
wicked
vizier
miscarried
and
resulted
in
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
hoped
and
expected
for
the
royal
honours
which
he
had
looked
for
fell
to
his
rival
mordecai
and
he
himself
was
hanged
on
the
gallows
which
he
had
made
ready
for
his
foe
in
this
story
we
seem
to
detect
a
reminiscence
more
or
less
confused
of
the
zoganes
of
the
sacaea
in
other
words
of
the
custom
of
investing
a
private
man
with
the
insignia
of
royalty
for
a
few
days
and
then
putting
him
to
death
on
the
gallows
or
the
cross
it
is
true
that
in
the
narrative
the
part
of
the
zoganes
is
divided
between
two
actors
one
of
whom
hopes
to
play
the
king
but
is
hanged
instead
while
the
other
acts
the
royal
part
and
escapes
the
gallows
to
which
he
was
destined
by
his
enemy
but
this
bisection
so
to
say
of
the
zoganes
may
have
been
deliberately
invented
by
the
jewish
author
of
the
book
of
esther
for
the
sake
of
setting
the
origin
of
purim
which
it
was
his
purpose
to
explain
in
a
light
that
should
reflect
glory
on
his
own
nation
or
perhaps
more
probably
it
points
back
to
a
custom
of
appointing
two
mock
kings
at
the
sacaea
one
of
whom
was
put
to
death
at
the
end
of
the
festival
while
the
other
was
allowed
to
go
free
at
least
for
a
time
we
shall
be
the
more
inclined
to
adopt
the
latter
hypothesis
when
we
observe
that
corresponding
to
the
two
rival
aspirants
to
the
temporary
kingship
there
appear
in
the
jewish
narrative
two
rival
queens
vashti
and
esther
one
of
whom
succeeds
to
the
high
estate
from
which
the
other
has
fallen
further
it
is
to
be
noted
that
mordecai
the
successful
candidate
for
the
mock
kingship
and
esther
the
successful
candidate
for
the
queenship
are
linked
together
by
close
ties
both
of
interest
and
blood
the
two
being
said
to
be
cousins
this
suggests
that
in
the
original
story
or
the
original
custom
there
may
have
figured
two
pairs
of
kings
and
queens
of
whom
one
pair
is
represented
in
the
jewish
narrative
by
mordecai
and
esther
and
the
other
by
haman
and
vashti
some
confirmation
of
this
view
is
furnished
by
the
names
of
two
at
least
out
of
the
four
personages
it
seems
to
be
now
generally
recognized
by
biblical
scholars
that
the
name
mordecai
which
has
no
meaning
in
hebrew
is
nothing
but
a
slightly
altered
form
of
marduk
or
merodach
the
name
of
the
chief
god
of
babylon
whose
great
festival
was
the
zakmuk
and
further
it
is
generally
admitted
that
esther
in
like
manner
is
equivalent
to
ishtar
the
great
babylonian
goddess
whom
the
greeks
called
astarte
and
who
is
more
familiar
to
english
readers
as
ashtaroth
the
derivation
of
the
names
of
haman
and
vashti
is
less
certain
but
some
high
authorities
are
disposed
to
accept
the
view
of
jensen
that
haman
is
identical
with
humman
or
homman
the
national
god
of
the
elamites
and
that
vashti
is
in
like
manner
an
elamite
goddess
whose
name
jensen
read
as
mashti
in
inscriptions
now
when
we
consider
that
the
elamites
were
from
time
immemorial
the
hereditary
foes
of
the
babylonians
and
had
their
capital
at
susa
the
very
place
in
which
the
scene
of
the
book
of
esther
is
laid
we
can
hardly
deny
the
plausibility
of
the
theory
that
haman
and
vashti
on
the
one
side
and
mordecai
and
esther
on
the
other
represent
the
antagonism
between
the
gods
of
elam
and
the
gods
of
babylon
and
the
final
victory
of
the
babylonian
deities
in
the
very
capital
of
their
rivals
it
is
therefore
possible
says
professor
nöldeke
that
we
here
have
to
do
with
a
feast
whereby
the
babylonians
commemorated
a
victory
gained
by
their
gods
over
the
gods
of
their
neighbours
the
elamites
against
whom
they
had
so
often
waged
war
the
jewish
feast
of
purim
is
an
annual
merrymaking
of
a
wholly
secular
kind
and
it
is
known
that
there
were
similar
feasts
among
the
babylonians
that
the
jews
in
babylonia
should
have
adopted
a
festival
of
this
sort
can
not
be
deemed
improbable
since
in
modern
germany
to
cite
an
analogous
case
many
jews
celebrate
christmas
after
the
manner
of
their
christian
in
so
far
at
least
as
it
is
a
secular
institution
it
is
true
that
hitherto
no
babylonian
feast
coinciding
like
purim
with
the
full
moon
of
the
twelfth
month
has
been
discovered
but
our
knowledge
of
the
babylonian
feasts
is
derived
from
documents
of
an
earlier
period
possibly
the
calendar
may
have
undergone
some
change
by
the
time
when
the
jewish
feast
of
purim
was
established
or
it
may
be
that
the
jews
intentionally
shifted
the
date
of
the
festival
which
they
borrowed
from
the
however
the
theory
of
an
opposition
between
the
gods
of
babylon
and
the
gods
of
elam
at
the
festival
appears
to
break
down
at
a
crucial
point
for
the
latest
and
most
accurate
reading
of
the
elamite
inscriptions
proves
i
am
informed
that
the
name
of
the
goddess
which
jensen
read
as
mashti
and
which
on
that
assumption
he
legitimately
compared
to
the
hebrew
vashti
must
really
be
read
as
parti
between
which
and
vashti
there
is
no
connexion
accordingly
in
a
discussion
of
the
origin
of
purim
it
is
safer
at
present
to
lay
no
weight
on
the
supposed
religious
antagonism
between
the
deities
of
babylon
and
elam
if
we
are
right
in
tracing
the
origin
of
purim
to
the
babylonian
sacaea
and
in
finding
the
counterpart
of
the
zoganes
in
haman
and
mordecai
it
would
appear
that
the
zoganes
during
his
five
days
of
office
personated
not
merely
a
king
but
a
god
whether
that
god
was
the
babylonian
marduk
or
some
other
deity
not
yet
identified
the
union
of
the
divine
and
royal
characters
in
a
single
person
is
so
common
that
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
meeting
with
it
in
ancient
babylon
and
the
view
that
the
mock
king
of
the
sacaea
died
as
a
god
on
the
cross
or
the
gallows
is
no
novelty
the
acute
and
learned
movers
long
ago
observed
that
we
should
be
overlooking
the
religious
significance
of
oriental
festivals
and
the
connexion
of
the
sacaea
with
the
worship
of
anaitis
if
we
were
to
treat
as
a
mere
jest
the
custom
of
disguising
a
slave
as
a
king
we
may
take
it
for
certain
that
with
the
royal
dignity
the
king
of
the
sacaea
assumed
also
the
character
of
an
oriental
ruler
as
representative
of
the
divinity
and
that
when
he
took
his
pleasure
among
the
women
of
the
king
s
harem
he
played
the
part
of
sandan
or
sardanapalus
himself
for
according
to
ancient
oriental
ideas
the
use
of
the
king
s
concubines
constituted
a
claim
to
the
throne
and
we
know
from
dio
that
the
king
received
full
power
over
the
harem
perhaps
he
began
his
reign
by
publicly
cohabiting
with
the
king
s
concubines
just
as
absalom
went
in
to
his
father
s
concubines
in
a
tent
spread
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
before
all
israel
for
the
purpose
of
thereby
making
known
and
strengthening
his
claim
to
the
whatever
may
be
thought
of
this
latter
conjecture
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
movers
is
right
in
laying
great
stress
both
on
the
permission
given
to
the
mock
king
to
invade
the
real
king
s
harem
and
on
the
intimate
connexion
of
the
sacaea
with
the
worship
of
anaitis
that
connexion
is
vouched
for
by
strabo
and
when
we
consider
that
in
strabo
s
time
the
cult
of
the
old
persian
goddess
anaitis
was
thoroughly
saturated
with
babylonian
elements
and
had
practically
merged
in
the
sensual
worship
of
the
babylonian
ishtar
or
astarte
we
shall
incline
to
view
with
favour
movers
s
further
conjecture
that
a
female
slave
may
have
been
appointed
to
play
the
divine
queen
to
the
part
of
the
divine
king
supported
by
the
zoganes
and
that
reminiscences
of
such
a
queen
have
survived
in
the
myth
or
legend
of
semiramis
according
to
tradition
semiramis
was
a
fair
courtesan
beloved
by
the
king
of
assyria
who
took
her
to
wife
she
won
the
king
s
heart
so
far
that
she
persuaded
him
to
yield
up
to
her
the
kingdom
for
five
days
and
having
assumed
the
sceptre
and
the
royal
robes
she
made
a
great
banquet
on
the
first
day
but
on
the
second
day
she
shut
up
her
husband
in
prison
or
put
him
to
death
and
thenceforward
reigned
alone
taken
with
strabo
s
evidence
as
to
the
association
of
the
sacaea
with
the
worship
of
anaitis
this
tradition
seems
clearly
to
point
to
a
custom
of
giving
the
zoganes
during
his
five
days
reign
a
queen
who
represented
the
goddess
anaitis
or
semiramis
or
astarte
in
short
the
great
asiatic
goddess
of
love
and
fertility
by
whatever
name
she
was
called
for
that
in
eastern
legend
semiramis
was
a
real
queen
of
assyria
who
had
absorbed
many
of
the
attributes
of
the
goddess
astarte
appears
to
be
established
by
the
researches
of
modern
scholars
in
particular
it
has
been
shewn
by
robertson
smith
that
the
worship
of
anaitis
is
not
only
modelled
on
astarte
worship
in
general
but
corresponds
to
that
particular
type
of
it
which
was
specially
associated
with
the
name
of
semiramis
the
identity
of
anaitis
and
the
mythical
semiramis
is
clearly
proved
by
the
circumstance
that
the
great
sanctuary
of
anaitis
at
zela
in
pontus
was
actually
built
upon
a
mound
of
semiramis
probably
the
old
worship
of
the
semitic
goddess
always
continued
there
even
after
her
semitic
name
of
semiramis
or
astarte
had
been
exchanged
for
the
persian
name
of
anaitis
perhaps
in
obedience
to
a
decree
of
the
persian
king
artaxerxes
who
first
spread
the
worship
of
anaitis
in
the
west
of
asia
it
is
highly
significant
not
only
that
the
sacaean
festival
was
annually
held
at
this
ancient
seat
of
the
worship
of
semiramis
or
astarte
but
further
that
the
whole
city
of
zela
was
formerly
inhabited
by
sacred
slaves
and
harlots
ruled
over
by
a
supreme
pontiff
who
administered
it
as
a
sanctuary
rather
than
as
a
city
formerly
we
may
suppose
this
priestly
king
himself
died
a
violent
death
at
the
sacaea
in
the
character
of
the
divine
lover
of
semiramis
while
the
part
of
the
goddess
was
played
by
one
of
the
sacred
prostitutes
the
probability
of
this
is
greatly
strengthened
by
the
existence
of
the
mound
of
semiramis
under
the
sanctuary
for
the
mounds
of
semiramis
which
were
pointed
out
all
over
western
asia
were
said
to
have
been
the
graves
of
her
lovers
whom
she
buried
alive
the
tradition
ran
that
the
great
and
lustful
queen
semiramis
fearing
to
contract
a
lawful
marriage
lest
her
husband
should
deprive
her
of
power
admitted
to
her
bed
the
handsomest
of
her
soldiers
only
however
to
destroy
them
all
afterwards
now
this
tradition
is
one
of
the
surest
indications
of
the
identity
of
the
mythical
semiramis
with
the
babylonian
goddess
ishtar
or
astarte
for
the
famous
babylonian
epic
which
recounts
the
deeds
of
the
hero
gilgamesh
tells
how
when
he
clothed
himself
in
royal
robes
and
put
his
crown
on
his
head
the
goddess
ishtar
was
smitten
with
love
of
him
and
wooed
him
to
be
her
mate
but
gilgamesh
rejected
her
insidious
advances
for
he
knew
the
sad
fate
that
had
overtaken
all
her
lovers
and
he
reproached
the
cruel
goddess
saying
the
lover
of
thy
youth
causest
to
weep
every
allallu
thou
didst
didst
crush
him
and
break
his
the
woods
he
stands
and
laments
my
pinions
didst
love
the
lion
of
perfect
strength
and
seven
times
thou
didst
dig
for
didst
love
the
horse
that
joyed
in
the
fray
whip
and
spur
and
lash
thou
didst
urge
him
didst
force
him
on
for
seven
double
hours
didst
force
him
on
when
wearied
and
thirsty
mother
the
goddess
silili
thou
madest
didst
also
love
a
shepherd
of
the
flock
continually
poured
out
for
thee
the
libation
daily
slaughtered
kids
for
thee
thou
didst
smite
him
and
didst
change
him
into
a
wolf
that
his
own
hunted
him
his
own
hounds
tore
him
to
the
hero
also
tells
the
miserable
end
of
a
gardener
in
the
service
of
the
goddess
s
father
the
hapless
swain
had
once
been
honoured
with
the
love
of
the
goddess
but
when
she
tired
of
him
she
changed
him
into
a
cripple
so
that
he
could
not
rise
from
his
bed
therefore
gilgamesh
fears
to
share
the
fate
of
all
her
former
lovers
and
spurns
her
proffered
favours
but
it
is
not
merely
that
the
myth
of
ishtar
thus
tallies
with
the
legend
of
semiramis
the
worship
of
the
goddess
was
marked
by
a
profligacy
which
has
found
its
echo
in
the
loose
character
ascribed
by
tradition
to
the
queen
inscriptions
which
confirm
and
supplement
the
evidence
of
herodotus
inform
us
that
ishtar
was
served
by
harlots
of
three
different
classes
all
dedicated
to
her
worship
indeed
there
is
reason
to
think
that
these
women
personated
the
goddess
herself
since
one
of
the
names
given
to
them
is
applied
also
to
her
thus
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
mythical
semiramis
is
substantially
a
form
of
ishtar
or
astarte
the
great
semitic
goddess
of
love
and
fertility
and
if
this
is
so
we
may
assume
with
at
least
a
fair
degree
of
probability
that
the
high
pontiff
of
zela
or
his
deputy
who
played
the
king
of
the
sacaea
at
the
sanctuary
of
semiramis
perished
as
one
of
the
unhappy
lovers
of
the
goddess
perhaps
as
tammuz
whom
she
caused
to
weep
every
when
he
had
run
his
brief
meteoric
career
of
pleasure
and
glory
his
bones
would
be
laid
in
the
great
mound
which
covered
the
mouldering
remains
of
many
mortal
gods
his
predecessors
whom
the
goddess
had
honoured
with
her
fatal
love
here
then
at
the
great
sanctuary
of
the
goddess
in
zela
it
appears
that
her
myth
was
regularly
translated
into
action
the
story
of
her
love
and
the
death
of
her
divine
lover
was
performed
year
by
year
as
a
sort
of
by
men
and
women
who
lived
for
a
season
and
sometimes
died
in
the
character
of
the
visionary
beings
whom
they
personated
the
intention
of
these
sacred
dramas
we
may
be
sure
was
neither
to
amuse
nor
to
instruct
an
idle
audience
and
as
little
were
they
designed
to
gratify
the
actors
to
whose
baser
passions
they
gave
the
reins
for
a
time
they
were
solemn
rites
which
mimicked
the
doings
of
divine
beings
because
man
fancied
that
by
such
mimicry
he
was
able
to
arrogate
to
himself
the
divine
functions
and
to
exercise
them
for
the
good
of
his
fellows
the
operations
of
nature
to
his
thinking
were
carried
on
by
mythical
personages
very
like
himself
and
if
he
could
only
assimilate
himself
to
them
completely
he
would
be
able
to
wield
all
their
powers
this
is
probably
the
original
motive
of
most
religious
dramas
or
mysteries
among
rude
peoples
the
dramas
are
played
the
mysteries
are
performed
not
to
teach
the
spectators
the
doctrines
of
their
creed
still
less
to
entertain
them
but
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
about
those
natural
effects
which
they
represent
in
mythical
disguise
in
a
word
they
are
magical
ceremonies
and
their
mode
of
operation
is
mimicry
or
sympathy
we
shall
probably
not
err
in
assuming
that
many
myths
which
we
now
know
only
as
myths
had
once
their
counterpart
in
magic
in
other
words
that
they
used
to
be
acted
as
a
means
of
producing
in
fact
the
events
which
they
describe
in
figurative
language
ceremonies
often
die
out
while
myths
survive
and
thus
we
are
left
to
infer
the
dead
ceremony
from
the
living
myth
if
myths
are
in
a
sense
the
reflections
or
shadows
of
men
cast
upon
the
clouds
we
may
say
that
these
reflections
continue
to
be
visible
in
the
sky
and
to
inform
us
of
the
doings
of
the
men
who
cast
them
long
after
the
men
themselves
are
not
only
beyond
our
range
of
vision
but
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
the
principle
of
mimicry
is
implanted
so
deep
in
human
nature
and
has
exerted
so
an
influence
on
the
development
of
religion
as
well
as
of
the
arts
that
it
may
be
well
even
at
the
cost
of
a
short
digression
to
illustrate
by
example
some
of
the
modes
in
which
primitive
man
has
attempted
to
apply
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
wants
by
means
of
religious
or
magical
dramas
for
it
seems
probable
that
the
masked
dances
and
ceremonies
which
have
played
a
great
part
in
the
social
life
of
savages
in
many
quarters
of
the
world
were
primarily
designed
to
subserve
practical
purposes
rather
than
simply
to
stir
the
emotions
of
the
spectators
and
to
while
away
the
languor
and
tedium
of
idle
hours
the
actors
sought
to
draw
down
blessings
on
the
community
by
mimicking
certain
powerful
superhuman
beings
and
in
their
assumed
character
working
those
beneficent
miracles
which
in
the
capacity
of
mere
men
they
would
have
confessed
themselves
powerless
to
effect
in
fact
the
aim
of
these
elementary
dramas
which
contain
in
germ
the
tragedy
and
comedy
of
civilized
nations
was
the
acquisition
of
superhuman
power
for
the
public
good
that
this
is
the
real
intention
of
at
least
many
of
these
dramatic
performances
will
appear
from
the
following
accounts
which
for
the
sake
of
accuracy
i
will
quote
for
the
most
part
in
the
words
of
the
original
observers
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
social
life
of
the
indian
tribes
of
america
are
the
elaborate
masked
dances
or
pantomimes
in
which
the
actors
personate
spirits
or
legendary
animals
most
of
them
appear
designed
to
bring
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
the
guardian
spirits
of
the
clans
owing
to
the
fact
that
these
spirits
are
hereditary
their
gifts
are
always
contained
in
the
legend
detailing
their
acquisition
by
the
ancestor
of
a
clan
the
principal
gifts
in
these
tales
are
the
magic
harpoon
which
insures
success
in
hunting
the
death
bringer
which
when
pointed
against
enemies
kills
them
the
water
of
life
which
resuscitates
the
dead
the
burning
fire
which
when
pointed
against
an
object
burns
it
and
a
dance
a
song
and
cries
which
are
peculiar
to
the
spirit
the
gift
of
this
dance
means
that
the
protégé
of
the
spirit
is
to
perform
the
same
dances
which
have
been
shown
to
him
in
these
dances
he
personates
the
spirit
he
wears
his
mask
and
his
ornaments
thus
the
dance
must
be
considered
a
dramatic
performance
of
the
myth
relating
to
the
acquisition
of
the
spirit
and
shows
to
the
people
that
the
performer
by
his
visit
to
the
spirit
has
obtained
his
powers
and
desires
when
nowadays
a
spirit
appears
to
a
young
indian
he
gives
him
the
same
dance
and
the
youth
also
returns
from
the
initiation
filled
with
the
powers
and
desires
of
the
spirit
he
authenticates
his
initiation
by
his
dance
in
the
same
way
as
his
mythical
ancestor
did
the
obtaining
of
the
magical
gifts
from
these
spirits
is
called
while
the
person
who
has
obtained
them
becomes
supernatural
which
is
also
the
quality
of
the
spirit
himself
the
ornaments
of
all
these
spirits
are
described
as
made
of
cedar
bark
which
is
dyed
red
in
the
juice
of
alder
bark
they
appear
to
their
devotees
only
in
winter
and
therefore
the
dances
are
also
performed
only
in
in
some
of
the
dances
the
performers
imitate
animals
and
the
explanation
which
the
indians
give
of
these
dances
is
that
the
ceremonial
was
instituted
at
the
time
when
men
had
still
the
form
of
animals
before
the
transformer
had
put
everything
into
its
present
shape
the
present
ceremonial
is
a
repetition
of
the
ceremonial
performed
by
the
man
animals
or
as
we
may
say
a
dramatization
of
the
myth
therefore
the
people
who
do
not
represent
spirits
represent
these
another
observer
of
these
indians
writes
on
the
same
subject
as
follows
the
and
other
performances
are
exhibitions
intended
to
represent
incidents
connected
with
their
mythological
legends
there
are
a
great
variety
and
they
seem
to
take
the
place
in
a
measure
of
theatrical
performances
or
games
during
the
season
of
the
religious
festivals
there
are
no
persons
especially
set
apart
as
priests
for
the
performance
of
these
ceremonies
although
some
who
seem
more
expert
than
others
are
usually
hired
to
give
life
to
the
scenes
but
these
performers
are
quite
as
often
found
among
the
slaves
or
common
people
as
among
the
chiefs
and
excepting
during
the
continuance
of
the
festivities
are
not
looked
on
as
of
any
particular
importance
on
inquiring
the
origin
of
these
ceremonies
i
was
informed
that
they
did
not
originate
with
the
indians
but
were
revelations
of
the
guardian
spirits
who
made
known
what
they
wished
to
be
performed
an
indian
for
instance
who
has
been
consulting
with
his
guardian
spirit
which
is
done
by
going
through
the
washing
and
fasting
process
before
described
will
imagine
or
think
he
is
called
upon
to
represent
the
owl
he
arranges
in
his
mind
the
style
of
dress
the
number
of
performers
the
songs
and
dances
or
other
movements
and
having
the
plan
perfected
announces
at
a
meeting
that
he
has
had
a
revelation
which
he
will
impart
to
a
select
few
these
are
then
taught
and
drilled
in
strict
secrecy
and
when
they
have
perfected
themselves
will
suddenly
make
their
appearance
and
perform
before
the
astonished
tribe
another
indian
gets
up
the
representation
of
the
whale
others
do
the
same
of
birds
and
in
fact
of
everything
that
they
can
think
of
if
any
performance
is
a
success
it
is
repeated
and
gradually
comes
to
be
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
regular
order
in
the
ceremonies
if
it
does
not
satisfy
the
audience
it
is
laid
aside
thus
they
have
performances
that
have
been
handed
down
from
remote
ages
while
others
are
of
a
more
recent
another
writer
who
travelled
among
the
indians
of
america
has
expressed
himself
on
this
subject
as
follows
the
task
of
representing
the
gods
is
undertaken
in
every
tribe
by
some
intelligent
and
according
to
their
own
account
inspired
men
they
form
the
secret
societies
in
order
that
their
secret
arts
and
doctrines
their
mummeries
and
masquerades
may
not
be
revealed
to
the
uninitiated
and
to
the
public
the
intention
of
these
exhibitions
is
to
confirm
the
faith
of
the
young
people
and
the
women
in
the
ancient
traditions
as
to
the
intercourse
of
the
gods
with
men
and
as
to
their
own
intimate
relations
to
the
gods
in
order
to
convince
possible
doubters
the
members
of
the
secret
societies
have
had
recourse
to
all
kinds
of
mysterious
means
which
to
a
civilized
man
must
appear
the
height
of
savagery
for
example
they
mutilate
their
bodies
rend
corpses
in
pieces
and
devour
them
tear
pieces
out
of
the
bodies
of
living
men
and
so
on
further
the
almost
morbid
vanity
of
the
indians
and
their
desire
to
win
fame
respect
and
distinction
may
have
served
as
a
motive
for
joining
the
secret
societies
since
every
member
of
them
enjoys
great
respect
there
were
and
still
are
hundreds
of
masks
in
use
every
one
of
which
represents
a
spirit
who
occurs
in
their
legends
in
the
exhibitions
they
appear
singly
or
in
groups
according
as
the
legend
to
be
represented
requires
and
the
masked
men
are
then
looked
upon
by
the
astonished
crowd
not
only
as
actors
representing
the
gods
but
as
the
very
gods
themselves
who
have
come
down
from
heaven
to
earth
hence
every
such
representative
must
do
exactly
what
legend
says
the
spirit
did
if
the
representative
wears
no
mask
as
often
happens
with
the
the
cannibals
or
biters
or
the
then
the
spirit
whom
he
represents
has
passed
into
his
body
and
accordingly
the
man
possessed
by
the
spirit
is
not
responsible
for
what
he
does
amiss
in
this
condition
as
the
use
of
masks
throws
a
sort
of
mysterious
glamour
over
the
performance
and
at
the
same
time
allows
the
actor
to
remain
unknown
the
peculiarly
sacred
festivals
are
much
oftener
celebrated
with
masks
than
without
them
in
every
secret
society
there
are
definite
rules
as
to
how
often
and
how
long
a
mask
may
be
used
amongst
the
kwakiutl
the
masks
may
not
under
the
heaviest
penalties
be
disposed
of
for
four
winters
the
season
when
such
festivals
are
usually
celebrated
after
that
time
they
may
be
destroyed
or
hidden
in
the
forest
that
no
uninitiated
person
may
find
them
or
they
may
be
finally
sold
the
masks
are
made
only
in
secret
generally
in
the
deep
solitude
of
the
woods
in
order
that
no
uninitiated
person
may
detect
the
maker
at
work
the
dance
is
accompanied
by
a
song
which
celebrates
in
boastful
words
the
power
of
the
gods
and
the
mighty
deeds
represented
in
the
performance
at
the
main
part
of
the
performance
all
present
join
in
the
song
for
it
is
generally
known
to
everybody
and
is
repeated
in
recitative
again
and
again
it
seems
that
new
songs
and
new
performances
are
constantly
springing
up
in
one
or
other
of
the
villages
through
the
agency
of
some
intelligent
young
man
hitherto
without
a
song
of
his
own
who
treats
in
a
poetical
fashion
some
legend
which
has
been
handed
down
orally
from
their
forefathers
for
every
man
who
takes
part
in
the
performances
and
festivals
must
make
his
with
a
song
composed
by
himself
in
this
way
new
songs
and
dances
are
constantly
originating
the
material
for
them
being
of
course
always
taken
from
the
tribal
deities
of
the
particular
singer
and
similar
masquerades
are
in
vogue
among
the
neighbours
of
these
indians
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
and
from
the
following
account
it
will
appear
that
the
performances
are
based
on
similar
ideas
and
beliefs
shamans
make
masks
representing
grotesque
faces
of
supernatural
beings
which
they
claim
to
have
seen
these
may
be
which
are
the
spirits
of
the
elements
of
places
and
of
inanimate
things
in
general
the
or
wandering
genii
or
the
shades
of
people
and
animals
the
are
seen
in
lonely
places
on
the
plains
and
mountains
or
at
sea
and
more
rarely
about
the
villages
by
the
clairvoyant
vision
of
the
shamans
they
are
usually
invisible
to
common
eyes
but
sometimes
render
themselves
visible
to
the
people
for
various
purposes
many
of
them
especially
among
the
are
of
evil
character
bringing
sickness
and
misfortune
upon
people
from
mere
wantonness
or
for
some
fancied
injury
the
eskimo
believe
that
everything
animate
or
inanimate
is
possessed
of
a
shade
having
semihuman
form
and
features
enjoying
more
or
less
freedom
of
motion
the
shamans
give
form
to
their
ideas
of
them
in
masks
as
well
as
of
others
which
they
claim
inhabit
the
moon
and
the
in
their
daily
life
if
the
people
witness
some
strange
occurrence
are
curiously
affected
or
have
a
remarkable
adventure
during
which
they
seem
to
be
influenced
or
aided
in
a
supernatural
manner
the
shamans
interpret
the
meaning
and
describe
the
appearance
of
the
being
that
exerted
its
power
curious
mythological
beasts
are
also
said
to
inhabit
both
land
and
sea
but
to
become
visible
only
on
special
occasions
these
ideas
furnish
material
upon
which
their
fancy
works
conjuring
up
strange
forms
that
are
usually
modifications
of
known
creatures
it
is
also
believed
that
in
early
days
all
animate
beings
had
a
dual
existence
becoming
at
will
either
like
man
or
the
animal
forms
they
now
wear
in
those
early
days
there
were
but
few
people
if
an
animal
wished
to
assume
its
human
form
the
forearm
wing
or
other
limb
was
raised
and
pushed
up
the
muzzle
or
beak
as
if
it
were
a
mask
and
the
creature
became
manlike
in
form
and
features
this
idea
is
still
held
and
it
is
believed
that
many
animals
now
possess
this
power
the
manlike
form
thus
appearing
is
called
the
and
is
supposed
to
represent
the
thinking
part
of
the
creature
and
at
death
becomes
its
shade
shamans
are
believed
to
have
the
power
of
seeing
through
the
animal
mask
to
the
manlike
features
behind
the
ideas
held
on
this
subject
are
well
illustrated
in
the
raven
legends
where
the
changes
are
made
repeatedly
from
one
form
to
another
masks
may
also
represent
totemic
animals
and
the
wearers
during
the
festivals
are
believed
actually
to
become
the
creature
represented
or
at
least
to
be
endowed
with
its
spiritual
essence
some
of
the
masks
of
the
lower
yukon
and
the
adjacent
territory
to
the
kuskokwim
are
made
with
double
faces
this
is
done
by
having
the
muzzle
of
the
animal
fitted
over
and
concealing
the
face
of
the
below
the
outer
mask
being
held
in
place
by
pegs
so
arranged
that
it
can
be
removed
quickly
at
a
certain
time
in
the
ceremony
thus
symbolizing
the
transformation
another
style
of
mask
from
the
lower
kuskokwim
has
the
under
face
concealed
by
a
small
hinged
door
on
each
side
which
opens
out
at
the
proper
time
in
a
ceremony
indicating
the
metamorphosis
when
the
mask
represents
a
totemic
animal
the
wearer
needs
no
double
face
since
he
represents
in
person
the
shade
of
the
totemic
animal
when
worn
in
any
ceremonial
either
as
a
totem
mask
or
as
representing
the
shade
or
the
wearer
is
believed
to
become
mysteriously
and
unconsciously
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
the
being
which
his
mask
represents
just
as
the
namesakes
are
entered
into
and
possessed
by
the
shades
at
certain
parts
of
the
festival
to
the
dead
mask
festivals
are
usually
held
as
a
species
of
thanksgiving
to
the
shades
and
powers
of
earth
air
and
water
for
giving
the
hunter
success
the
or
shades
of
the
powers
and
creatures
of
the
earth
are
represented
that
they
may
be
propitiated
thus
insuring
further
the
religious
ritual
of
the
cora
indians
of
mexico
comprises
elaborate
dramatic
ceremonies
or
dances
in
which
the
actors
or
dancers
identify
themselves
with
the
gods
such
as
the
god
of
the
morning
star
the
goddess
of
the
moon
and
the
divinities
of
the
rain
these
dances
form
the
principal
part
of
the
cora
festivals
and
are
accompanied
by
liturgical
songs
the
words
of
which
the
indians
believe
to
have
been
revealed
to
their
forefathers
by
the
gods
and
to
exercise
a
direct
magical
influence

the
kobeua
and
kaua
indians
of
brazil
perform
masked
dances
at
their
festivals
in
honour
of
the
dead
the
maskers
imitate
the
actions
and
the
habits
of
birds
beasts
and
insects
for
example
there
is
a
large
butterfly
which
delights
the
eye
with
the
splendour
of
its
colour
like
a
fallen
fragment
of
the
sky
and
in
the
butterfly
dance
two
men
represent
the
play
of
these
brilliant
insects
in
the
sunshine
fluttering
on
the
wing
and
settling
on
sandbanks
and
rocks
again
the
sloth
is
acted
by
a
masker
who
holds
on
to
a
of
the
house
by
means
of
a
hooked
stick
in
imitation
of
the
sluggish
creature
which
will
hang
by
its
claws
from
the
bough
of
a
tree
for
hours
together
without
stirring
again
the
darting
of
swallows
as
they
flit
to
and
fro
across
a
river
is
mimicked
by
masked
men
dancing
side
by
side
the
swarming
of
sandflies
in
the
air
is
acted
by
a
swarm
of
maskers
and
so
with
the
movements
of
the
black
vulture
the
owl
the
jaguar
the
fish
the
and
the
yet
these
representations
are
not
simple
dramas
designed
to
amuse
and
divert
the
mourners
in
their
hour
of
sorrow
the
indian
attributes
to
them
a
much
deeper
significance
for
under
the
outer
husk
of
beasts
and
birds
and
insects
he
believes
that
there
lurk
foul
fiends
and
powerful
spirits
all
these
mimicries
are
based
on
an
idea
of
magical
efficiency
they
are
intended
to
bring
blessing
and
fertility
to
the
village
and
its
inhabitants
to
the
plantations
and
to
the
whole
of
surrounding
nature
thereby
compensating
as
it
were
for
the
loss
of
the
dead
man
in
whose
honour
the
festival
is
held
by
copying
as
faithfully
as
possible
the
movements
and
actions
of
the
being
whom
he
personates
the
actor
identifies
himself
with
him
the
mysterious
force
which
resides
in
the
mask
passes
into
the
dancer
turns
the
man
himself
into
a
mighty
demon
and
endows
him
with
the
power
of
banning
demons
or
earning
their
favour
especially
is
it
the
intention
by
means
of
mimicry
to
obtain
for
man
control
over
the
demons
of
growth
and
the
spirits
of
game
and
when
the
festival
is
over
the
masks
are
burned
and
the
demons
which
are
thought
to
have
animated
them
take
flight
to
their
own
place
it
may
be
to
the
other
world
or
to
a
mountain
top
or
to
the
side
of
a
thundering
cascade
the
monumbo
of
german
new
guinea
perform
masked
dances
in
which
the
dancers
personate
supernatural
beings
or
animals
such
as
kangaroos
dogs
and
cassowaries
they
consecrate
the
masks
by
fumigating
them
with
the
smoke
of
a
certain
creeper
and
believe
that
by
doing
so
they
put
life
into
them
accordingly
they
afterwards
treat
the
masks
with
respect
talk
to
them
as
if
they
were
alive
and
refuse
to
part
with
them
to
europeans
certain
of
the
masks
they
even
regard
as
guardian
spirits
and
appeal
to
them
for
fine
weather
help
in
the
chase
or
in
war
and
so
forth
every
clan
owns
some
masks
and
the
head
man
of
the
clan
makes
all
the
arrangements
for
a
masquerade
the
dances
are
accompanied
by
songs
of
which
the
words
are
unintelligible
even
to
the
natives
themselves
again
the
kayans
of
central
borneo
perform
masked
dances
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
abundant

swathed
in
cumbrous
masses
of
green
leaves
in
accordance
with
their
belief
that
the
spirits
are
more
powerful
than
men
the
kayans
assume
that
when
they
imitate
the
form
of
spirits
and
play
their
part
they
acquire
superhuman
power
hence
just
as
their
spirits
can
fetch
back
the
souls
of
men
so
they
imagine
that
they
can
lure
to
themselves
the
souls
of
the
when
the
sea
dyaks
of
borneo
have
taken
a
human
head
they
hold
a
in
honour
of
the
or
singalang
burong
who
lives
far
away
above
the
sky
at
this
festival
a
long
liturgy
called
is
chanted
the
god
is
invoked
and
is
believed
to
be
present
in
the
person
of
an
actor
who
poses
as
the
deity
and
blesses
the
people
in
his
name
but
the
invocation
is
not
made
by
the
human
performer
in
the
manner
of
a
prayer
direct
to
this
great
being
it
takes
the
form
of
a
story
setting
forth
how
the
mythical
hero
kling
or
klieng
made
a
and
fetched
singalang
burong
to
it
this
kling
about
whom
there
are
many
fables
is
a
spirit
and
is
supposed
to
live
somewhere
or
other
not
far
from
mankind
and
to
be
able
to
confer
benefits
upon
them
the
dyak
performer
or
performers
then
as
they
walk
up
and
down
the
long
verandah
of
the
house
singing
the
in
reality
describe
kling
s
and
how
singalang
burong
was
invited
and
came
in
thought
the
dyaks
identify
themselves
with
kling
and
the
resultant
signification
is
that
the
recitation
of
this
story
is
an
invocation
to
singalang
burong
who
is
supposed
to
come
not
to
kling
s
house
only
but
to
the
actual
dyak
house
where
the
feast
is
celebrated
and
he
is
received
by
a
particular
ceremony
and
is
offered
food
or
at
the
close
of
the
ceremony
the
performer
goes
along
the
house
beginning
with
the
head
man
touches
each
person
in
it
and
pronounces
an
invocation
upon
him
in
this
he
is
supposed
to
personate
singalang
burong
and
his
who
are
believed
to
be
the
real
actors
singalang
burong
himself
the
headmen
and
his
the
birds
bless
the
rest
the
touch
of
the
human
performer
and
the
accompanying
invocation
are
thought
to
effect
a
communication
between
these
from
the
skies
and
each
individual
being
the
great
and
his
dependants
come
from
above
to
give
men
their
charms
and
their
blessings
upon
the
men
the
performer
invokes
physical
strength
and
bravery
in
war
and
upon
the
women
luck
with
paddy
cleverness
in
dyak
feminine
accomplishments
and
beauty
in
form
and
thus
the
dramatic
performances
of
these
primitive
peoples
are
in
fact
religious
or
oftener
perhaps
magical
ceremonies
and
the
songs
or
recitations
which
accompany
them
are
spells
or
incantations
though
the
real
character
of
both
is
apt
to
be
overlooked
by
civilized
man
accustomed
as
he
is
to
see
in
the
drama
nothing
more
than
an
agreeable
pastime
or
at
best
a
vehicle
of
moral
instruction
yet
if
we
could
trace
the
drama
of
the
civilized
nations
back
to
its
origin
we
might
find
that
it
had
its
roots
in
magical
or
religious
ideas
like
those
which
still
mould
and
direct
the
masked
dances
of
many
savages
certainly
the
athenians
in
the
heyday
of
their
brilliant
civilization
retained
a
lively
sense
of
the
religious
import
of
dramatic
performances
for
they
associated
them
directly
with
the
worship
of
dionysus
and
allowed
them
to
be
enacted
only
during
the
festivals
of
the
god
in
india
also
the
drama
appears
to
have
been
developed
out
of
religious
dances
or
pantomimes
in
which
the
actors
recited
the
deeds
and
played
the
parts
of
national
gods
and
heroes
hence
it
is
at
least
a
legitimate
hypothesis
that
the
criminal
who
masqueraded
as
a
king
and
perished
in
that
character
at
the
bacchanalian
festival
of
the
sacaea
was
only
one
of
a
company
of
actors
who
figured
on
that
occasion
in
a
sacred
drama
of
which
the
substance
has
been
preserved
to
us
in
the
book
of
esther
when
once
we
perceive
that
the
gods
and
goddesses
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
mythology
have
been
represented
officially
so
to
say
by
a
long
succession
of
living
men
and
women
who
bore
the
names
and
were
supposed
to
exercise
the
functions
of
these
fabulous
creatures
we
have
attained
a
point
of
vantage
from
which
it
seems
possible
to
propose
terms
of
peace
between
two
rival
schools
of
mythologists
who
have
been
waging
fierce
war
on
each
other
for
ages
on
the
one
hand
it
has
been
argued
that
mythical
beings
are
nothing
but
personifications
of
natural
objects
and
natural
processes
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
maintained
that
they
are
nothing
but
notable
men
and
women
who
in
their
lifetime
for
one
reason
or
another
made
a
great
impression
on
their
fellows
but
whose
doings
have
been
distorted
and
exaggerated
by
a
false
and
credulous
tradition
these
two
views
it
is
now
easy
to
see
are
not
so
mutually
exclusive
as
their
supporters
have
imagined
the
personages
about
whom
all
the
marvels
of
mythology
have
been
told
may
have
been
real
human
beings
as
the
euhemerists
allege
and
yet
they
may
have
been
at
the
same
time
personifications
of
natural
objects
or
processes
as
the
adversaries
of
euhemerism
assert
the
doctrine
of
incarnation
supplies
the
missing
link
that
was
needed
to
unite
the
two
seemingly
inconsistent
theories
if
the
powers
of
nature
or
a
certain
department
of
nature
be
conceived
as
personified
in
a
deity
and
that
deity
can
become
incarnate
in
a
man
or
woman
it
is
obvious
that
the
incarnate
deity
is
at
the
same
time
a
real
human
being
and
a
personification
of
nature
to
take
the
instance
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
semiramis
may
have
been
the
great
semitic
goddess
of
love
ishtar
or
astarte
and
yet
she
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
incarnate
in
a
woman
or
even
in
a
series
of
real
women
whether
queens
or
harlots
whose
memory
survives
in
ancient
history
saturn
again
may
have
been
the
god
of
sowing
and
planting
and
yet
may
have
been
represented
on
earth
by
a
succession
or
dynasty
of
sacred
kings
whose
gay
but
short
lives
may
have
contributed
to
build
up
the
legend
of
the
golden
age
the
longer
the
series
of
such
human
divinities
the
greater
obviously
the
chance
of
their
myth
or
legend
surviving
and
when
moreover
a
deity
of
a
uniform
type
was
represented
whether
under
the
same
name
or
not
over
a
great
extent
of
country
by
many
local
dynasties
of
divine
men
or
women
it
is
clear
that
the
stories
about
him
would
tend
still
further
to
persist
and
be
stereotyped
the
conclusions
which
we
have
reached
in
regard
to
the
legend
of
semiramis
and
her
lovers
probably
holds
good
of
all
the
similar
tales
that
were
current
in
antiquity
throughout
the
east
in
particular
it
may
be
assumed
to
apply
to
the
myths
of
aphrodite
and
adonis
in
syria
of
cybele
and
attis
in
phrygia
and
of
isis
and
osiris
in
egypt
if
we
could
trace
these
stories
back
to
their
origin
we
might
find
that
in
every
case
a
human
couple
acted
year
by
year
the
parts
of
the
loving
goddess
and
the
dying
god
we
know
that
down
to
roman
times
attis
was
personated
by
priests
who
bore
his
name
and
if
within
the
period
of
which
we
have
knowledge
the
dead
attis
and
the
dead
adonis
were
represented
only
by
effigies
we
may
surmise
that
it
had
not
always
been
so
and
that
in
both
cases
the
dead
god
was
once
represented
by
a
dead
man
further
the
license
accorded
to
the
man
who
played
the
dying
god
at
the
sacaea
speaks
strongly
in
favour
of
the
hypothesis
that
before
the
incarnate
deity
was
put
to
a
public
death
he
was
in
all
cases
allowed
or
rather
required
to
enjoy
the
embraces
of
a
woman
who
played
the
goddess
of
love
the
reason
for
such
an
enforced
union
of
the
human
god
and
goddess
is
not
hard
to
divine
if
primitive
man
believes
that
the
growth
of
the
crops
can
be
stimulated
by
the
intercourse
of
common
men
and
women
what
showers
of
blessings
will
he
not
anticipate
from
the
commerce
of
a
pair
whom
his
fancy
invests
with
all
the
dignity
and
powers
of
deities
of
fertility
thus
the
theory
of
movers
that
at
the
sacaea
the
zoganes
represented
a
god
and
paired
with
a
woman
who
personated
a
goddess
turns
out
to
rest
on
deeper
and
wider
foundations
than
that
able
scholar
was
aware
of
he
thought
that
the
divine
couple
who
figured
by
deputy
at
the
ceremony
were
semiramis
and
sandan
or
sardanapalus
it
now
appears
that
he
was
substantially
right
as
to
the
goddess
but
we
have
still
to
enquire
into
the
god
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
name
sardanapalus
is
only
the
greek
way
of
representing
ashurbanapal
the
name
of
the
greatest
and
nearly
the
last
king
of
assyria
but
the
records
of
the
real
monarch
which
have
come
to
light
within
recent
years
give
little
support
to
the
fables
that
attached
to
his
name
in
classical
tradition
for
they
prove
that
far
from
being
the
effeminate
weakling
he
seemed
to
the
greeks
of
a
later
age
he
was
a
warlike
and
enlightened
monarch
who
carried
the
arms
of
assyria
to
distant
lands
and
fostered
at
home
the
growth
of
science
and
letters
still
though
the
historical
reality
of
king
ashurbanapal
is
as
well
attested
as
that
of
alexander
or
charlemagne
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
myths
gathered
like
clouds
round
the
great
figure
that
loomed
large
in
the
stormy
sunset
of
assyrian
glory
now
the
two
features
that
stand
out
most
prominently
in
the
legends
of
sardanapalus
are
his
extravagant
debauchery
and
his
violent
death
in
the
flames
of
a
great
pyre
on
which
he
burned
himself
and
his
concubines
to
save
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
his
victorious
enemies
it
is
said
that
the
womanish
king
with
painted
face
and
arrayed
in
female
attire
passed
his
days
in
the
seclusion
of
the
harem
spinning
purple
wool
among
his
concubines
and
wallowing
in
sensual
delights
and
that
in
the
epitaph
which
he
caused
to
be
carved
on
his
tomb
he
recorded
that
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
ate
and
drank
and
toyed
remembering
that
life
is
short
and
full
of
trouble
that
fortune
is
uncertain
and
that
others
would
soon
enjoy
the
good
things
which
he
must
leave
behind
these
traits
bear
little
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
ashurbanapal
either
in
life
or
in
death
for
after
a
brilliant
career
of
conquest
the
assyrian
king
died
in
old
age
at
the
height
of
human
ambition
with
peace
at
home
and
triumph
abroad
the
admiration
of
his
subjects
and
the
terror
of
his
foes
but
if
the
traditional
characteristics
of
sardanapalus
harmonize
but
ill
with
what
we
know
of
the
real
monarch
of
that
name
they
fit
well
enough
with
all
that
we
know
or
can
conjecture
of
the
mock
kings
who
led
a
short
life
and
a
merry
during
the
revelry
of
the
sacaea
the
asiatic
equivalent
of
the
saturnalia
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
for
the
most
part
such
men
with
death
staring
them
in
the
face
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
sought
to
drown
care
and
deaden
fear
by
plunging
madly
into
all
the
fleeting
joys
that
still
offered
themselves
under
the
sun
when
their
brief
pleasures
and
sharp
sufferings
were
over
and
their
bones
or
ashes
mingled
with
the
dust
what
more
natural
that
on
their
mounds
in
which
the
people
saw
not
untruly
the
graves
of
the
lovers
of
should
be
carved
some
such
lines
as
those
which
tradition
placed
in
the
mouth
of
the
great
assyrian
king
to
remind
the
heedless
of
the
shortness
and
vanity
of
life
when
we
turn
to
sandan
the
other
legendary
or
mythical
being
whom
movers
thought
that
the
zoganes
may
have
personated
we
find
the
arguments
in
support
of
his
theory
still
stronger
the
city
of
tarsus
in
cilicia
is
said
to
have
been
founded
by
a
certain
sandan
whom
the
greeks
identified
with
hercules
and
at
the
festival
of
this
god
or
hero
an
effigy
of
him
was
burned
on
a
great
pyre
this
sandan
is
doubtless
the
same
with
the
sandes
whom
agathias
calls
the
old
persian
hercules
professing
to
give
a
list
of
the
gods
whom
the
persians
worshipped
before
the
days
of
zoroaster
the
byzantine
historian
mentions
bel
sandes
and
anaitis
whom
he
identifies
with
zeus
hercules
and
aphrodite
respectively
as
we
know
that
bel
was
a
babylonian
not
a
persian
deity
and
that
in
later
times
anaitis
was
practically
equivalent
to
the
babylonian
ishtar
or
astarte
a
strong
presumption
is
raised
that
sandes
also
was
a
babylonian
or
at
all
events
semitic
deity
and
that
in
speaking
of
him
as
persian
the
historian
confused
the
ancient
persians
with
the
babylonians
and
perhaps
other
stocks
of
western
asia
the
presumption
is
strengthened
when
we
find
that
in
lydia
the
surname
of
sandon
doubtless
equivalent
to
sandan
is
said
to
have
been
borne
by
hercules
because
he
wore
a
woman
s
garment
called
a
fine
and
diaphanous
as
gossamer
at
the
bidding
of
queen
omphale
whom
the
hero
served
for
three
years
in
the
guise
of
a
female
slave
clad
in
purple
humbly
carding
wool
and
submitting
to
be
slapped
by
the
saucy
queen
with
her
golden
slipper
the
familiar
legend
that
hercules
burned
himself
alive
on
a
great
pyre
completes
the
parallel
between
the
effeminate
hercules
sandon
of
lydia
and
the
assyrian
sardanapalus
so
exact
a
parallel
must
surely
rest
on
a
common
base
of
custom
as
well
as
of
myth
that
base
according
to
the
conjecture
of
the
admirable
scholar
müller
may
have
been
a
custom
of
dressing
up
an
effigy
of
an
effeminate
asiatic
deity
in
the
semblance
of
a
reveller
and
then
publicly
burning
it
on
a
pyre
such
a
custom
appears
to
have
prevailed
not
only
at
tarsus
in
cilicia
but
also
in
lydia
for
a
coin
of
the
lydian
philadelphia
a
city
which
lay
not
far
from
the
old
royal
capital
sardes
exhibits
a
device
like
that
on
coins
of
tarsus
consisting
of
a
figure
stretched
on
a
pyre
we
may
suppose
says
müller
that
in
the
old
assyrian
mythology
a
certain
being
called
sandan
or
perhaps
sardan
figured
beside
baal
and
mylitta
or
astarte
the
character
of
this
mythical
personage
is
one
which
often
meets
us
in
oriental
extreme
of
voluptuousness
and
sensuality
combined
with
miraculous
force
and
heroic
strength
we
may
imagine
that
at
the
great
festivals
of
nineveh
this
sandan
or
sardan
was
exhibited
as
a
buxom
figure
with
womanish
features
the
pale
face
painted
with
white
lead
the
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
blackened
with
kohl
his
person
loaded
with
golden
chains
rings
and
earrings
arrayed
in
a
bright
red
transparent
garment
grasping
a
goblet
in
one
hand
and
perhaps
as
a
symbol
of
strength
a
double
axe
in
the
other
while
he
sat
and
surrounded
by
women
on
a
splendidly
adorned
couch
under
a
purple
canopy
altogether
not
unlike
the
figure
of
adonis
at
the
court
festivals
of
alexandria
then
the
people
of
mad
nineveh
as
the
poet
phocylides
called
it
the
harlot
as
the
prophet
nahum
has
it
would
rejoice
and
make
merry
with
this
their
darling
hero
afterwards
there
may
have
been
another
show
when
this
gorgeous
sandan
or
sardan
was
to
be
seen
on
a
huge
pyre
of
precious
wood
draped
in
tapestry
and
laden
with
incense
and
spices
of
every
sort
which
being
set
on
fire
to
the
howling
of
a
countless
multitude
and
the
deafening
din
of
shrill
music
sent
up
a
monstrous
pillar
of
fire
whirling
towards
heaven
and
flooded
half
nineveh
with
smoke
and
the
distinguished
scholar
whom
i
have
just
quoted
does
not
fail
to
recognize
the
part
which
imagination
plays
in
the
picture
he
has
set
before
us
but
he
reminds
us
very
properly
that
in
historical
enquiries
imagination
must
always
supply
the
cement
that
binds
together
the
broken
fragments
of
tradition
one
thing
he
thinks
emerges
clearly
from
the
present
investigation
the
worship
and
legend
of
an
effeminate
hero
like
sandan
appear
to
have
spread
by
means
of
an
early
diffusion
of
the
semitic
stock
first
to
the
neighbourhood
of
tarsus
in
cilicia
and
afterwards
to
sardes
in
lydia
in
favour
of
the
former
prevalence
of
the
rite
in
lydia
it
may
be
added
that
the
oldest
dynasty
of
lydian
kings
traced
their
descent
not
only
from
the
mythical
assyrian
hero
ninus
but
also
from
the
greek
hero
hercules
whose
legendary
death
in
the
fire
finds
at
least
a
curious
echo
in
the
story
that
croesus
the
last
king
of
lydia
was
laid
by
his
persian
conqueror
cyrus
on
a
great
pyre
of
wood
and
was
only
saved
at
the
last
moment
from
being
consumed
in
the
flames
may
not
this
story
embody
a
reminiscence
of
the
manner
in
which
the
ancient
kings
of
lydia
as
living
embodiments
of
their
god
formerly
met
their
end
it
was
thus
as
we
have
seen
that
the
old
prussian
rulers
used
to
burn
themselves
alive
in
front
of
the
sacred
oak
and
by
an
odd
coincidence
if
it
is
nothing
more
the
greek
hercules
directed
that
the
pyre
on
which
he
was
to
be
consumed
should
be
made
of
the
wood
of
the
oak
and
the
wild
olive
some
grounds
have
also
been
shewn
for
thinking
that
in
certain
south
african
tribes
the
chiefs
may
formerly
have
been
burnt
alive
as
a
religious
or
magical
ceremony
all
these
facts
and
indications
tend
to
support
the
view
of
movers
that
at
the
sacaea
also
the
man
who
played
the
god
for
five
days
was
originally
burnt
at
the
end
of
them
death
by
hanging
or
crucifixion
may
have
been
a
later
mitigation
of
his
sufferings
though
it
is
quite
possible
that
both
forms
of
execution
or
rather
of
sacrifice
may
have
been
combined
by
hanging
or
crucifying
the
victim
first
and
burning
him
afterwards
much
as
our
forefathers
used
to
disembowel
traitors
after
suspending
them
for
a
few
minutes
on
a
gibbet
at
tarsus
apparently
the
custom
was
still
further
softened
by
burning
an
effigy
instead
of
a
man
but
on
this
point
the
evidence
is
not
explicit
it
is
worth
observing
that
as
late
as
lucian
s
time
the
principal
festival
of
the
year
at
great
seat
of
the
worship
of
at
the
beginning
of
spring
and
took
its
name
of
the
pyre
or
the
torch
from
the
tall
masts
which
were
burnt
in
the
court
of
the
temple
with
sheep
goats
and
other
animals
hanging
from
them
here
the
season
the
fire
and
the
all
fit
our
hypothesis
only
the
is
wanting
if
the
jewish
festival
of
purim
was
as
i
have
attempted
to
shew
directly
descended
either
from
the
sacaea
or
from
some
other
semitic
festival
of
which
the
central
feature
was
the
sacrifice
of
a
man
in
the
character
of
a
god
we
should
expect
to
find
traces
of
human
sacrifice
lingering
about
it
in
one
or
other
of
those
mitigated
forms
to
which
i
have
just
referred
this
expectation
is
fully
borne
out
by
the
facts
for
from
an
early
time
it
has
been
customary
with
the
jews
at
the
feast
of
purim
to
burn
or
otherwise
destroy
effigies
of
haman
the
practice
was
well
known
under
the
roman
empire
for
in
the
year
the
emperors
honorius
and
theodosius
issued
a
decree
commanding
the
governors
of
the
provinces
to
take
care
that
the
jews
should
not
burn
effigies
of
haman
on
a
cross
at
one
of
their
festivals
we
learn
from
the
decree
that
the
custom
gave
great
offence
to
the
christians
who
regarded
it
as
a
blasphemous
parody
of
the
central
mystery
of
their
own
religion
little
suspecting
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
continuation
in
a
milder
form
of
a
rite
that
had
probably
been
celebrated
in
the
east
long
ages
before
the
birth
of
christ
apparently
the
custom
long
survived
the
publication
of
the
edict
for
in
a
form
of
abjuration
which
the
greek
church
imposed
on
jewish
converts
and
which
seems
to
date
from
the
tenth
century
the
renegade
is
made
to
speak
as
follows
i
curse
also
those
who
celebrate
the
festival
of
the
mordecai
on
the
first
sabbath
saturday
of
the
christian
fast
and
who
nail
haman
forsooth
to
the
tree
attaching
to
it
the
symbol
of
the
cross
and
burning
him
along
with
it
while
they
heap
all
sorts
of
imprecations
and
curses
on
the
a
jewish
account
of
the
custom
as
it
was
observed
in
babylonia
and
persia
in
the
tenth
century
of
our
era
runs
as
follows
it
is
customary
in
babylonia
and
elam
for
boys
to
make
an
effigy
resembling
haman
this
they
suspend
on
their
roofs
four
or
five
days
before
purim
on
purim
day
they
erect
a
bonfire
and
cast
the
effigy
into
its
midst
while
the
boys
stand
round
about
it
jesting
and
singing
and
they
have
a
ring
suspended
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
which
ring
they
hold
and
wave
from
one
side
of
the
fire
to
the
again
the
arab
historian
albîrûnî
who
wrote
in
the
year
informs
us
that
at
purim
the
jews
of
his
time
rejoiced
greatly
over
the
death
of
haman
and
that
they
made
figures
which
they
beat
and
burned
imitating
the
burning
of
hence
one
name
for
the
festival
was
another
arabic
writer
makrîzî
who
died
in
says
that
at
the
feast
of
purim
which
fell
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
some
of
the
jews
used
to
make
effigies
of
haman
which
they
first
played
with
and
then
threw
into
the
fire
during
the
middle
ages
the
italian
jews
celebrated
purim
in
a
lively
fashion
which
has
been
compared
by
their
own
historians
to
that
of
the
carnival
the
children
used
to
range
themselves
in
rows
opposite
each
other
and
pelt
one
another
with
nuts
while
people
rode
on
horseback
through
the
streets
with
pine
branches
in
their
hands
or
blew
trumpets
and
made
merry
round
a
puppet
representing
haman
which
was
set
on
a
platform
or
scaffold
and
then
solemnly
burnt
on
a
pyre
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
jews
of
frankfort
used
at
purim
to
make
pyramids
of
thin
wax
candles
which
they
set
on
fire
also
they
fashioned
images
of
haman
and
his
wife
out
of
candles
and
burned
them
on
the
in
the
synagogue
now
when
we
consider
the
close
correspondence
in
character
as
well
as
in
date
between
the
jewish
purim
and
the
christian
carnival
and
remember
further
that
the
effigy
of
carnival
which
is
now
destroyed
at
this
merry
season
had
probably
its
prototype
in
a
living
man
who
was
put
to
a
violent
death
in
the
character
of
saturn
at
the
saturnalia
analogy
of
itself
would
suggest
that
in
former
times
the
jews
like
the
babylonians
from
whom
they
appear
to
have
derived
their
purim
may
at
one
time
have
burned
hanged
or
crucified
a
real
man
in
the
character
of
haman
there
are
some
positive
grounds
for
thinking
that
this
was
so
the
early
church
historian
socrates
informs
us
that
at
inmestar
a
town
in
syria
the
jews
were
wont
to
observe
certain
sports
among
themselves
in
the
course
of
which
they
played
many
foolish
pranks
in
the
year
being
heated
with
wine
they
carried
these
sports
further
than
usual
and
began
deriding
christians
and
even
christ
himself
and
to
give
the
more
zest
to
their
mockery
they
seized
a
christian
child
bound
him
to
a
cross
and
hung
him
up
at
first
they
only
laughed
and
jeered
at
him
but
soon
their
passions
getting
the
better
of
them
they
the
child
so
that
he
died
under
their
hands
the
thing
got
noised
abroad
and
resulted
in
a
serious
brawl
between
the
jews
and
their
christian
neighbours
the
authorities
then
stepped
in
and
the
jews
had
to
pay
dear
for
the
crime
they
had
perpetrated
in
sport
the
christian
historian
does
not
mention
and
perhaps
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
drunken
and
jovial
festival
which
ended
so
tragically
but
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
it
was
purim
and
that
the
boy
who
died
on
the
cross
represented
haman
in
mediæval
and
modern
times
many
accusations
of
ritual
murders
as
they
are
called
have
been
brought
against
the
jews
and
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
charge
have
been
discussed
on
both
sides
with
a
heat
which
however
natural
has
tended
rather
to
inflame
the
passions
of
the
disputants
than
to
elicit
the
truth
into
this
troubled
arena
i
prefer
not
to
enter
i
will
only
observe
that
so
far
as
i
have
looked
into
the
alleged
cases
and
these
are
reported
in
sufficient
detail
the
majority
of
the
victims
are
said
to
have
been
children
and
to
have
met
their
fate
in
spring
often
in
the
week
before
easter
this
last
circumstance
points
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
accusations
to
a
connexion
of
the
human
sacrifice
with
the
passover
which
falls
in
this
week
rather
than
with
purim
which
falls
a
month
earlier
indeed
it
has
often
been
made
a
part
of
the
accusation
that
the
blood
of
the
youthful
victims
was
intended
to
be
used
at
the
passover
if
all
the
charges
of
ritual
murder
which
have
been
brought
against
the
jews
in
modern
times
are
not
as
seems
most
probable
mere
idle
calumnies
the
baneful
fruit
of
bigotry
ignorance
and
malice
the
extraordinary
tenacity
of
life
exhibited
by
the
lowest
forms
of
superstition
in
the
minds
of
ignorant
people
whether
they
are
jews
or
gentiles
would
suffice
to
account
for
an
occasional
recrudescence
of
primitive
barbarity
among
the
most
degraded
part
of
the
jewish
community
to
make
the
jews
as
a
nation
responsible
for
outrages
which
if
they
occur
at
all
are
doubtless
quite
as
repugnant
to
them
as
they
are
to
every
humane
mind
would
be
a
monstrous
injustice
it
would
be
as
fair
to
charge
christians
in
general
with
complicity
in
the
incalculably
greater
number
of
massacres
and
atrocities
of
every
kind
that
have
been
perpetrated
by
christians
in
the
name
of
christianity
not
merely
on
jews
and
heathen
but
on
men
and
women
and
children
who
died
same
faith
as
their
torturers
and
murderers
if
deeds
of
the
sort
alleged
have
been
really
done
by
question
on
which
i
must
decline
to
pronounce
an
would
interest
the
student
of
custom
as
isolated
instances
of
reversion
to
an
old
and
barbarous
ritual
which
once
flourished
commonly
enough
among
the
ancestors
both
of
jews
and
gentiles
but
on
which
as
on
a
noxious
monster
an
enlightened
humanity
has
long
set
its
heel
such
customs
die
hard
it
is
not
the
fault
of
society
as
a
whole
if
sometimes
the
reptile
has
strength
enough
left
to
lift
its
venomous
head
and
sting
but
between
the
stage
when
human
sacrifice
goes
on
unabashed
in
the
light
of
common
day
and
the
stage
when
it
has
been
driven
out
of
sight
into
dark
holes
and
corners
there
intervenes
a
period
during
which
the
custom
is
slowly
dwindling
away
under
the
growing
light
of
knowledge
and
philanthropy
in
this
middle
period
many
subterfuges
are
resorted
to
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
old
ritual
in
a
form
which
will
not
offend
the
new
morality
a
common
and
successful
device
is
to
consummate
the
sacrifice
on
the
person
of
a
malefactor
whose
death
at
the
altar
or
elsewhere
is
little
likely
to
excite
pity
or
indignation
since
it
partakes
of
the
character
of
a
punishment
and
people
recognize
that
if
the
miscreant
had
not
been
dealt
with
by
the
priest
it
would
have
been
needful
in
the
public
interest
to
hand
him
over
to
the
executioner
we
have
seen
that
in
the
rhodian
sacrifices
to
cronus
a
condemned
criminal
was
after
a
time
substituted
for
an
innocent
victim
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
at
babylon
the
criminals
who
perished
in
the
character
of
gods
at
the
sacaea
enjoyed
an
honour
which
at
an
earlier
period
had
been
reserved
for
more
respectable
persons
it
seems
therefore
by
no
means
impossible
that
the
jews
in
borrowing
the
sacaea
from
babylon
under
the
new
name
of
purim
should
have
borrowed
along
with
it
the
custom
of
putting
to
death
a
malefactor
who
after
masquerading
as
mordecai
in
a
crown
and
royal
robe
was
hanged
or
crucified
in
the
character
of
haman
there
are
some
grounds
for
thinking
that
this
or
something
of
this
sort
was
done
but
a
consideration
of
them
had
better
be
deferred
till
we
have
cleared
up
some
points
which
still
remain
obscure
in
purim
and
in
the
account
which
the
jews
give
of
its
origin
in
the
first
place
then
it
deserves
to
be
remarked
that
the
joyous
festival
of
purim
on
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
days
of
the
month
adar
is
invariably
preceded
by
a
fast
known
as
the
fast
of
esther
on
the
thirteenth
indeed
some
jews
fast
for
several
days
before
purim
in
the
book
of
esther
the
fast
is
traditionally
explained
as
a
commemoration
of
the
mourning
and
lamentation
excited
among
the
jews
by
the
decree
of
king
ahasuerus
that
they
should
all
be
massacred
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
for
in
every
province
whithersoever
the
king
s
commandment
and
his
decree
came
there
was
great
mourning
among
the
jews
and
fasting
and
weeping
and
wailing
and
many
lay
in
sackcloth
and
and
esther
before
she
went
into
the
presence
of
the
king
to
plead
for
the
lives
of
her
people
bade
them
return
answer
unto
mordecai
go
gather
together
all
the
jews
that
are
present
in
shushan
and
fast
ye
for
me
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
three
days
night
or
day
i
also
and
my
maidens
will
fast
in
like
hence
fasting
and
lamentation
were
ordained
as
the
proper
preparation
for
the
happy
feast
of
purim
which
commemorated
the
great
deliverance
of
the
jews
from
the
destruction
that
had
threatened
them
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
adar
now
we
have
seen
that
in
the
opinion
of
some
eminent
modern
scholars
the
basis
of
the
book
of
esther
is
not
history
but
a
babylonian
myth
which
celebrated
the
triumphs
and
sufferings
of
deities
rather
than
of
men
on
this
hypothesis
how
is
the
fast
that
precedes
purim
to
be
explained
the
best
solution
appears
to
be
that
of
jensen
that
the
fasting
and
mourning
were
originally
for
the
supposed
annual
death
of
a
semitic
god
or
hero
of
the
type
of
tammuz
or
adonis
whose
resurrection
on
the
following
day
occasioned
that
outburst
of
joy
and
gladness
which
is
characteristic
of
purim
the
particular
god
or
hero
whose
death
and
resurrection
thus
touched
with
sorrow
and
filled
with
joy
the
hearts
of
his
worshippers
may
have
been
according
to
jensen
either
the
great
hero
gilgamesh
or
his
comrade
and
friend
eabani
the
doughty
deeds
and
adventures
of
this
mighty
pair
are
the
theme
of
the
longest
babylonian
poem
that
has
been
as
yet
discovered
it
is
recorded
on
twelve
tablets
and
this
circumstance
has
suggested
to
some
scholars
the
view
that
the
story
may
be
a
solar
myth
descriptive
of
the
sun
s
annual
course
through
the
twelve
months
or
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
however
that
may
be
the
scene
of
the
poem
is
laid
chiefly
at
the
very
ancient
babylonian
city
of
erech
the
chief
seat
of
the
worship
of
the
goddess
ishtar
or
astarte
who
plays
an
important
part
in
the
story
for
the
goddess
is
said
to
have
been
smitten
with
the
charms
of
gilgamesh
and
to
have
made
love
to
him
but
he
spurned
her
proffered
favours
and
thereafter
fell
into
a
sore
sickness
probably
through
the
wrath
of
the
offended
goddess
his
comrade
eabani
also
roused
the
fury
of
ishtar
and
was
wounded
to
death
for
twelve
days
he
lingered
on
a
bed
of
pain
and
when
he
died
his
friend
gilgamesh
mourned
and
lamented
for
him
and
rested
not
until
he
had
prevailed
on
the
god
of
the
dead
to
suffer
the
spirit
of
eabani
to
return
to
the
upper
world
the
resurrection
of
eabani
recorded
on
the
twelfth
tablet
forms
the
conclusion
of
the
long
poem
jensen
s
theory
is
that
the
death
and
resurrection
of
a
mythical
being
who
combined
in
himself
the
features
of
a
solar
god
and
an
ancient
king
of
erech
were
celebrated
at
the
babylonian
zakmuk
or
festival
of
the
new
year
and
that
the
transference
of
the
drama
from
erech
its
original
seat
to
babylon
led
naturally
to
the
substitution
of
marduk
the
great
god
of
babylon
for
gilgamesh
or
eabani
in
the
part
of
the
hero
although
jensen
apparently
does
not
identify
the
zakmuk
with
the
sacaea
a
little
consideration
will
shew
how
well
his
general
theory
of
zakmuk
fits
in
with
those
features
of
the
sacaean
festival
which
have
emerged
in
the
course
of
our
enquiry
at
the
sacaean
festival
if
i
am
right
a
man
who
personated
a
god
or
hero
of
the
type
of
tammuz
or
adonis
enjoyed
the
favours
of
a
woman
probably
a
sacred
harlot
who
represented
the
great
semitic
goddess
ishtar
or
astarte
and
after
he
had
thus
done
his
part
towards
securing
by
means
of
sympathetic
magic
the
revival
of
plant
life
in
spring
he
was
put
to
death
we
may
suppose
that
the
death
of
this
divine
man
was
mourned
over
by
his
worshippers
and
especially
by
women
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
the
women
of
jerusalem
wept
for
tammuz
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
and
as
syrian
damsels
mourned
the
dead
adonis
while
the
river
ran
red
with
his
blood
such
rites
appear
in
fact
to
have
been
common
all
over
western
asia
the
particular
name
of
the
dying
god
varied
in
different
places
but
in
substance
the
ritual
was
the
same
fundamentally
the
custom
was
a
religious
or
rather
magical
ceremony
intended
to
ensure
the
revival
and
reproduction
of
life
in
spring
now
if
this
interpretation
of
the
sacaea
is
correct
it
is
obvious
that
one
important
feature
of
the
ceremony
is
wanting
in
the
brief
notices
of
the
festival
that
have
come
down
to
us
the
death
of
the
at
the
festival
is
recorded
but
nothing
is
said
of
his
resurrection
yet
if
he
really
personated
a
being
of
the
adonis
or
attis
type
we
may
feel
pretty
sure
that
his
dramatic
death
was
followed
at
a
shorter
or
longer
interval
by
his
dramatic
revival
just
as
at
the
festivals
of
attis
and
adonis
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
god
quickly
succeeded
to
his
mimic
death
here
however
a
difficulty
presents
itself
at
the
sacaea
the
died
a
real
not
a
mere
mimic
death
and
in
ordinary
life
the
resurrection
even
of
a
is
at
least
not
an
everyday
occurrence
what
was
to
be
done
the
man
or
rather
the
god
was
undoubtedly
dead
how
was
he
to
come
to
life
again
obviously
the
best
if
not
the
only
way
was
to
set
another
and
living
man
to
support
the
character
of
the
reviving
god
and
we
may
conjecture
that
this
was
done
we
may
suppose
that
the
insignia
of
royalty
which
had
adorned
the
dead
man
were
transferred
to
his
successor
who
arrayed
in
them
would
be
presented
to
his
rejoicing
worshippers
as
their
god
come
to
life
again
and
by
his
side
would
probably
be
displayed
a
woman
in
the
character
of
his
divine
consort
the
goddess
ishtar
or
astarte
in
favour
of
this
hypothesis
it
may
be
observed
that
it
at
once
furnishes
a
clear
and
intelligible
explanation
of
a
remarkable
feature
in
the
book
of
esther
which
has
not
yet
so
far
as
i
am
aware
been
adequately
elucidated
i
mean
that
apparent
duplication
of
the
principal
characters
to
which
i
have
already
directed
the
reader
s
attention
if
i
am
right
haman
represents
the
temporary
king
or
mortal
god
who
was
put
to
death
at
the
sacaea
and
his
rival
mordecai
represents
the
other
temporary
king
who
on
the
death
of
his
predecessor
was
invested
with
his
royal
insignia
and
exhibited
to
the
people
as
the
god
come
to
life
again
similarly
vashti
the
deposed
queen
in
the
narrative
corresponds
to
the
woman
who
played
the
part
of
queen
and
goddess
to
the
first
mock
king
the
haman
and
her
successful
rival
esther
or
ishtar
answers
to
the
woman
who
figured
as
the
divine
consort
of
the
second
mock
king
the
mordecai
or
marduk
a
trace
of
the
sexual
license
accorded
to
the
mock
king
of
the
festival
seems
to
be
preserved
in
the
statement
that
king
ahasuerus
found
haman
fallen
on
the
bed
with
esther
and
asked
will
he
even
force
the
queen
before
me
in
the
house
we
have
seen
that
the
mock
king
of
the
sacaea
did
actually
possess
the
right
of
using
the
real
king
s
concubines
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
view
of
movers
that
he
began
his
short
reign
by
exercising
the
right
in
public
in
the
parallel
ritual
of
adonis
the
marriage
of
the
goddess
with
her
lover
was
publicly
celebrated
the
day
before
his
mimic
death
a
clear
reminiscence
of
the
time
when
the
relation
between
esther
and
mordecai
was
conceived
as
much
more
intimate
than
mere
cousinship
appears
to
be
preserved
in
some
of
the
jewish
plays
acted
at
purim
in
which
mordecai
appears
as
the
lover
of
esther
and
this
significant
indication
is
confirmed
by
the
teaching
of
the
rabbis
that
king
ahasuerus
never
really
knew
esther
but
that
a
phantom
in
her
likeness
lay
with
him
while
the
real
esther
sat
on
the
lap
of
mordecai
the
persian
setting
in
which
the
hebrew
author
of
the
book
of
esther
has
framed
his
picture
naturally
suggests
that
the
jews
derived
their
feast
of
purim
not
directly
from
the
old
babylonians
but
from
their
persian
conquerors
even
if
this
could
be
demonstrated
it
would
in
no
way
invalidate
the
theory
that
purim
originated
in
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
sacaea
since
we
know
that
the
sacaea
was
celebrated
by
the
persians
hence
it
becomes
worth
while
to
enquire
whether
in
the
persian
religion
we
can
detect
any
traces
of
a
festival
akin
to
the
sacaea
or
purim
here
lagarde
has
shewn
the
way
by
directing
attention
to
the
old
persian
ceremony
known
as
the
ride
of
the
beardless
this
was
a
rite
performed
both
in
persia
and
babylonia
at
the
beginning
of
spring
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
which
in
the
most
ancient
persian
calendar
corresponded
to
march
so
that
the
date
of
the
ceremony
agrees
with
that
of
the
babylonian
new
year
festival
of
zakmuk
a
beardless
and
if
possible
buffoon
was
set
naked
on
an
ass
a
horse
or
a
mule
and
conducted
in
a
sort
of
mock
triumph
through
the
streets
of
the
city
in
one
hand
he
held
a
crow
and
in
the
other
a
fan
with
which
he
fanned
himself
complaining
of
the
heat
while
the
people
pelted
him
with
ice
and
snow
and
drenched
him
with
cold
water
he
was
supposed
to
drive
away
the
cold
and
to
aid
him
perhaps
in
discharging
this
useful
function
he
was
fed
with
hot
food
and
hot
stuffs
were
smeared
on
his
body
riding
on
his
ass
and
attended
by
all
the
king
s
household
if
the
city
happened
to
be
the
capital
or
if
it
was
not
by
all
the
retainers
of
the
governor
who
were
also
mounted
he
paraded
the
streets
and
extorted
contributions
he
stopped
at
the
doors
of
the
rich
and
if
they
did
not
give
him
what
he
asked
for
he
befouled
their
garments
with
mud
or
a
mixture
of
red
ochre
and
water
which
he
carried
in
an
earthenware
pot
if
a
shopkeeper
hesitated
a
moment
to
respond
to
his
demands
the
importunate
beggar
had
the
right
to
confiscate
all
the
goods
in
the
shop
so
the
tradesmen
who
saw
him
bearing
down
on
them
not
unnaturally
hastened
to
anticipate
his
wants
by
contributing
of
their
substance
before
he
could
board
them
everything
that
he
thus
collected
from
break
of
day
to
the
time
of
morning
prayers
belonged
to
the
king
or
governor
of
the
city
but
everything
that
he
laid
hands
on
between
the
first
and
the
second
hour
of
prayer
he
kept
for
himself
after
the
second
prayers
he
disappeared
and
if
the
people
caught
him
later
in
the
day
they
were
free
to
beat
him
to
their
heart
s
content
in
like
manner
proceeds
one
of
the
native
writers
who
has
described
the
custom
people
at
the
present
time
appoint
a
new
year
lord
and
make
merry
and
this
they
do
because
the
season
which
is
the
beginning
of
azur
or
march
coincides
with
the
sun
s
entry
into
aries
for
on
that
day
they
disport
themselves
and
rejoice
because
the
winter
is
now
in
this
harlequin
who
rode
through
the
streets
attended
by
all
the
king
s
men
and
levying
contributions
which
went
either
to
the
royal
treasury
or
to
the
pocket
of
the
collector
we
recognize
the
familiar
features
of
the
mock
or
temporary
king
who
is
invested
for
a
short
time
with
the
pomp
and
privileges
of
royalty
for
reasons
which
have
been
already
explained
the
abrupt
disappearance
of
the
persian
clown
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
day
coupled
with
the
leave
given
to
the
populace
to
thrash
him
if
they
found
him
afterwards
points
plainly
enough
to
the
harder
fate
that
probably
awaited
him
in
former
days
when
he
paid
with
his
life
for
his
brief
tenure
of
a
kingly
crown
the
resemblance
between
his
burlesque
progress
and
that
of
mordecai
through
the
streets
of
susa
is
obvious
though
the
jewish
author
of
esther
has
depicted
in
brighter
colours
the
pomp
of
his
hero
in
royal
apparel
of
blue
and
white
and
with
a
great
crown
of
gold
and
with
a
robe
of
fine
linen
and
purple
riding
the
king
s
own
charger
and
led
through
the
city
by
one
of
the
king
s
most
noble
princes
the
difference
between
the
two
scenes
is
probably
not
to
be
explained
simply
by
the
desire
of
the
jewish
writer
to
shed
a
halo
of
glory
round
the
personage
whom
he
regarded
as
the
deliverer
of
his
people
so
long
as
the
temporary
king
was
a
real
substitute
for
the
reigning
monarch
and
had
to
die
sooner
or
later
in
his
stead
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
treated
with
a
greater
show
of
deference
and
should
simulate
his
royal
brother
more
closely
than
a
clown
who
had
nothing
worse
than
a
beating
to
fear
when
he
laid
down
his
office
in
short
after
the
serious
meaning
of
the
custom
had
been
forgotten
and
the
substitute
was
allowed
to
escape
with
his
life
the
high
tragedy
of
the
ancient
ceremony
would
rapidly
degenerate
into
farce
but
while
the
ride
of
the
beardless
one
is
from
one
point
of
view
a
degenerate
copy
of
the
original
regarded
from
another
point
of
view
it
preserves
some
features
which
are
almost
certainly
primitive
though
they
do
not
appear
in
the
kindred
babylonian
and
jewish
festivals
the
persian
custom
bears
the
stamp
of
a
popular
festivity
rather
than
of
a
state
ceremonial
and
everywhere
it
seems
as
if
popular
festivals
when
left
to
propagate
themselves
freely
among
the
folk
reveal
their
old
meaning
and
intention
more
transparently
than
when
they
have
been
adopted
into
the
official
religion
and
enshrined
in
a
ritual
the
simple
thoughts
of
our
simple
forefathers
are
better
understood
by
their
unlettered
descendants
than
by
the
majority
of
educated
people
their
rude
rites
are
more
faithfully
preserved
and
more
truly
interpreted
by
a
rude
peasantry
than
by
the
priest
who
wraps
up
their
nakedness
in
the
gorgeous
pall
of
religious
pomp
or
by
the
philosopher
who
dissolves
their
crudities
into
the
thin
air
of
allegory
in
the
present
instance
the
purpose
of
the
ride
of
the
beardless
one
at
the
beginning
of
spring
is
sufficiently
obvious
it
was
meant
to
hasten
the
departure
of
winter
and
the
approach
of
summer
we
are
expressly
told
that
the
clown
who
went
about
fanning
himself
and
complaining
of
the
heat
while
the
populace
snowballed
him
was
supposed
to
dispel
the
cold
and
even
without
any
such
assurance
we
should
be
justified
in
inferring
as
much
from
his
behaviour
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
which
is
little
more
than
an
elaborate
system
of
you
can
make
the
weather
warm
by
pretending
that
it
is
so
or
if
you
can
not
you
may
be
sure
that
there
is
some
person
wiser
than
yourself
who
can
such
a
wizard
in
the
estimation
of
the
persians
was
the
beardless
man
who
went
through
the
performance
i
have
described
and
no
doubt
his
physical
defects
were
believed
to
contribute
in
some
occult
manner
to
the
success
of
the
rite
the
ceremony
was
thus
as
lagarde
acutely
perceived
the
oriental
equivalent
of
those
popular
european
customs
which
celebrate
the
advent
of
spring
by
representing
in
a
dramatic
form
the
expulsion
or
defeat
of
winter
by
the
victorious
summer
but
whereas
in
europe
the
two
rival
seasons
are
often
if
not
regularly
personated
by
two
actors
or
two
effigies
in
persia
a
single
actor
sufficed
whether
he
definitely
represented
winter
or
summer
is
not
quite
clear
but
his
pretence
of
suffering
from
heat
and
his
final
disappearance
suggest
that
if
he
personified
either
of
the
seasons
it
was
the
departing
winter
rather
than
the
coming
summer
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
connexion
thus
traced
between
purim
and
the
ride
of
the
beardless
one
we
are
now
in
a
position
finally
to
unmask
the
leading
personages
in
the
book
of
esther
i
have
attempted
to
shew
that
haman
and
vashti
are
little
more
than
doubles
of
mordecai
and
esther
who
in
turn
conceal
under
a
thin
disguise
the
features
of
marduk
and
ishtar
the
great
god
and
goddess
of
babylon
but
why
the
reader
may
ask
should
the
divine
pair
be
thus
duplicated
and
the
two
pairs
set
in
opposition
to
each
other
the
answer
is
suggested
by
the
popular
european
celebrations
of
spring
to
which
i
have
just
adverted
if
my
interpretation
of
these
customs
is
right
the
contrast
between
the
summer
and
winter
or
between
the
life
and
death
which
figure
in
effigy
or
in
the
persons
of
living
representatives
at
the
spring
ceremonies
of
our
peasantry
is
fundamentally
a
contrast
between
the
dying
or
dead
vegetation
of
the
old
and
the
sprouting
vegetation
of
the
new
contrast
which
would
lose
nothing
of
its
point
when
as
in
ancient
rome
and
babylon
and
persia
the
beginning
of
spring
was
also
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
in
these
and
in
all
the
ceremonies
we
have
been
examining
the
antagonism
is
not
between
powers
of
a
different
order
but
between
the
same
power
viewed
in
different
aspects
as
old
and
young
it
is
in
short
nothing
but
the
eternal
and
pathetic
contrast
between
youth
and
age
and
as
the
power
or
spirit
of
vegetation
is
represented
in
religious
ritual
and
popular
custom
by
a
human
pair
whether
they
be
called
ishtar
and
tammuz
or
venus
and
adonis
or
the
queen
and
king
of
may
so
we
may
expect
to
find
the
old
decrepit
spirit
of
the
past
year
personated
by
one
pair
and
the
fresh
young
spirit
of
the
new
year
by
another
this
if
my
hypothesis
is
right
is
the
ultimate
explanation
of
the
struggle
between
haman
and
vashti
on
the
one
side
and
their
doubles
mordecai
and
esther
on
the
other
in
the
last
analysis
both
pairs
stood
for
the
powers
that
make
for
the
fertility
of
plants
and
perhaps
also
of
animals
but
the
one
pair
embodied
the
failing
energies
of
the
past
and
the
other
the
vigorous
and
growing
energies
of
the
coming
year
both
powers
on
my
hypothesis
were
personified
not
merely
in
myth
but
in
custom
for
year
by
year
a
human
couple
undertook
to
quicken
the
life
of
nature
by
a
union
in
which
as
in
a
microcosm
the
loves
of
tree
and
plant
of
herb
and
flower
of
bird
and
beast
were
supposed
in
some
mystic
fashion
to
be
summed
up
originally
we
may
conjecture
such
couples
exercised
their
functions
for
a
whole
year
on
the
conclusion
of
which
the
male
divine
put
to
death
but
in
historical
times
it
seems
that
as
a
rule
the
human
saturn
zoganes
tammuz
or
whatever
he
was
his
divine
privileges
and
discharged
his
divine
duties
only
for
a
short
part
of
the
year
this
curtailment
of
his
reign
on
earth
was
probably
introduced
at
the
time
when
the
old
hereditary
divinities
or
deified
kings
contrived
to
shift
the
most
painful
part
of
their
duties
to
a
substitute
whether
that
substitute
was
a
son
or
a
slave
or
a
malefactor
having
to
die
as
a
king
it
was
necessary
that
the
substitute
should
also
live
as
a
king
for
a
season
but
the
real
monarch
would
naturally
restrict
within
the
narrowest
limits
both
of
time
and
of
power
a
reign
which
so
long
as
it
lasted
necessarily
encroached
upon
and
indeed
superseded
his
own
what
became
of
the
divine
king
s
female
partner
the
human
goddess
who
shared
his
bed
and
transmitted
his
beneficent
energies
to
the
rest
of
nature
we
can
not
say
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
is
little
or
no
evidence
that
she
like
him
suffered
death
when
her
primary
function
was
discharged
the
nature
of
maternity
suggests
an
obvious
reason
for
sparing
her
a
little
longer
till
that
mysterious
law
which
links
together
woman
s
life
with
the
changing
aspects
of
the
nightly
sky
had
been
fulfilled
by
the
birth
of
an
infant
god
who
should
in
his
turn
reared
perhaps
by
her
tender
care
grow
up
to
live
and
die
for
the
world
conclusion
we
may
now
sum
up
the
general
results
of
the
enquiry
which
we
have
pursued
in
the
present
chapter
we
have
found
evidence
that
festivals
of
the
type
of
the
saturnalia
characterized
by
an
inversion
of
social
ranks
and
the
sacrifice
of
a
man
in
the
character
of
a
god
were
at
one
time
held
all
over
the
ancient
world
from
italy
to
babylon
such
festivals
seem
to
date
from
an
early
age
in
the
history
of
agriculture
when
people
lived
in
small
communities
each
presided
over
by
a
sacred
or
divine
king
whose
primary
duty
was
to
secure
the
orderly
succession
of
the
seasons
the
fertility
of
the
earth
and
the
fecundity
both
of
cattle
and
of
women
associated
with
him
was
his
wife
or
other
female
consort
with
whom
he
performed
some
of
the
necessary
ceremonies
and
who
therefore
shared
his
divine
character
originally
his
term
of
office
appears
to
have
been
limited
to
a
year
on
the
conclusion
of
which
he
was
put
to
death
but
in
time
he
contrived
by
force
or
craft
to
extend
his
reign
and
sometimes
to
procure
a
substitute
who
after
a
short
and
more
or
less
nominal
tenure
of
the
crown
was
slain
in
his
stead
at
first
the
substitute
for
the
divine
father
was
probably
the
divine
son
but
afterwards
this
rule
was
no
longer
insisted
on
and
still
later
the
growth
of
a
humane
feeling
demanded
that
the
victim
should
always
be
a
condemned
criminal
in
this
advanced
stage
of
degeneration
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
light
of
divinity
suffered
eclipse
and
many
should
fail
to
detect
the
god
in
the
malefactor
yet
the
downward
career
of
fallen
deity
does
not
stop
here
even
a
criminal
comes
to
be
thought
too
good
to
personate
a
god
on
the
gallows
or
in
the
fire
and
then
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
make
up
a
more
or
less
grotesque
effigy
and
so
to
hang
burn
or
otherwise
destroy
the
god
in
the
person
of
this
sorry
representative
by
this
time
the
original
meaning
of
the
ceremony
may
be
so
completely
forgotten
that
the
puppet
is
supposed
to
represent
some
historical
personage
who
earned
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
his
fellows
in
his
life
and
whose
memory
has
ever
since
been
held
up
to
eternal
execration
by
the
annual
destruction
of
his
effigy
the
figures
of
haman
of
the
carnival
and
of
winter
or
death
which
are
or
used
to
be
annually
destroyed
in
spring
by
jews
catholics
and
the
peasants
of
central
europe
respectively
appear
to
be
all
lineal
descendants
of
those
human
incarnations
of
the
powers
of
nature
whose
life
and
death
were
deemed
essential
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
but
of
the
three
the
only
one
which
has
preserved
a
clear
trace
of
its
original
meaning
is
the
effigy
of
winter
or
death
in
the
others
the
ancient
significance
of
the
custom
as
a
magical
ceremony
designed
to
direct
the
course
of
nature
has
been
almost
wholly
obscured
by
a
thick
aftergrowth
of
legend
and
myth
the
cause
of
this
distinction
is
that
whereas
the
practice
of
destroying
an
effigy
of
winter
or
death
has
been
handed
down
from
time
immemorial
through
generations
of
simple
peasants
the
festivals
of
purim
and
the
carnival
as
well
as
their
babylonian
and
italian
prototypes
the
sacaea
and
the
saturnalia
were
for
centuries
domesticated
in
cities
where
they
were
necessarily
exposed
to
those
thousand
transforming
and
disintegrating
currents
of
speculation
and
enquiry
of
priestcraft
and
policy
which
roll
their
turbid
waters
through
the
busy
haunts
of
men
but
leave
undefiled
the
limpid
springs
of
mythic
fancy
in
the
country
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
analysis
of
the
saturnalia
and
kindred
festivals
which
i
have
now
brought
to
a
close
it
seems
to
point
to
a
remarkable
homogeneity
of
civilization
throughout
southern
europe
and
western
asia
in
prehistoric
times
how
far
such
homogeneity
of
civilization
may
be
taken
as
evidence
of
homogeneity
of
race
is
a
question
for
the
ethnologist
it
does
not
concern
us
here
but
without
discussing
it
i
may
remind
the
reader
that
in
the
far
east
of
asia
we
have
met
with
temporary
kings
whose
magical
functions
and
intimate
relation
to
agriculture
stand
out
in
the
clearest
light
while
india
furnishes
examples
of
kings
who
have
regularly
been
obliged
to
sacrifice
themselves
at
the
end
of
a
term
of
years
all
these
things
appear
to
hang
together
all
of
them
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
the
shattered
remnants
of
a
uniform
zone
of
religion
and
society
which
at
a
remote
era
belted
the
old
world
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
pacific
whether
that
was
so
or
not
i
may
at
least
claim
to
have
made
it
probable
that
if
the
king
of
the
wood
at
aricia
lived
and
died
as
an
incarnation
of
a
sylvan
deity
the
functions
he
thus
discharged
were
by
no
means
singular
and
that
for
the
nearest
parallel
to
them
we
need
not
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
italy
where
the
divine
king
god
of
the
sown
and
sprouting
annually
slain
in
the
person
of
a
human
representative
at
his
ancient
festival
of
the
saturnalia
it
is
possible
that
such
sacrifices
of
deified
men
performed
for
the
salvation
of
the
world
may
have
helped
to
beget
the
notion
that
the
universe
or
some
part
of
it
was
originally
created
out
of
the
bodies
of
gods
offered
up
in
sacrifice
certainly
it
is
curious
that
notions
of
this
sort
meet
us
precisely
in
parts
of
the
world
where
such
sacrifices
appear
to
have
been
regularly
accomplished
thus
in
ancient
mexico
where
the
sacrifice
of
human
beings
in
the
character
of
gods
formed
a
conspicuous
feature
of
the
national
religion
it
is
said
that
in
the
beginning
when
as
yet
the
light
of
day
was
not
the
gods
created
the
sun
to
illumine
the
earth
by
voluntarily
burning
themselves
in
the
fire
leaping
one
after
the
other
into
the
flames
of
a
great
furnace
again
in
the
babylonian
genesis
the
great
god
bel
created
the
world
by
cleaving
the
female
monster
tiamat
in
twain
and
using
the
severed
halves
of
her
body
to
form
the
heaven
and
the
earth
afterwards
perceiving
that
the
earth
was
waste
and
void
he
obligingly
ordered
one
of
the
gods
to
cut
off
his
the
creator
s
head
and
with
the
flowing
blood
mixed
with
clay
he
kneaded
a
paste
out
of
which
he
moulded
men
and
animals
similarly
in
a
hymn
of
the
rig
veda
we
read
how
the
gods
created
the
world
out
of
the
dismembered
body
of
the
great
primordial
giant
purushu
the
sky
was
made
out
of
his
head
the
earth
out
of
his
feet
the
sun
out
of
his
eye
and
the
moon
out
of
his
mind
animals
and
men
were
also
engendered
from
his
dripping
fat
or
his
limbs
and
the
great
gods
indra
and
agni
sprang
from
his
mouth
the
crude
nay
savage
account
of
creation
thus
set
forth
by
the
poet
was
retained
by
the
brahman
doctors
of
a
later
age
and
refined
by
them
into
a
subtle
theory
of
sacrifice
in
general
according
to
them
the
world
was
not
only
created
in
the
beginning
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
creator
prajapati
the
lord
of
creatures
to
this
day
it
is
renewed
and
preserved
solely
by
a
repetition
of
that
mystic
sacrifice
in
the
daily
sacrificial
ritual
celebrated
by
the
brahmans
every
day
the
body
of
the
creator
and
saviour
is
broken
anew
and
every
day
it
is
pieced
together
for
the
restoration
and
conservation
of
a
universe
which
otherwise
must
dissolve
and
be
shattered
into
fragments
thus
is
the
world
continually
created
afresh
by
the
of
the
deity
and
wonderful
to
relate
the
priest
who
offers
the
sacrifice
identifies
himself
with
the
creator
and
so
by
the
very
act
of
sacrificing
renews
the
universe
and
keeps
up
uninterrupted
the
revolution
of
time
and
matter
all
things
depend
on
his
beneficent
nay
divine
activity
from
the
heaven
above
to
the
earth
beneath
from
the
greatest
god
to
the
meanest
worm
from
the
sun
and
moon
to
the
humblest
blade
of
grass
and
the
minutest
particle
of
dust
happily
this
grandiose
theory
of
sacrifice
as
a
process
essential
to
the
salvation
of
the
world
does
not
oblige
the
priest
to
imitate
his
glorious
prototype
by
dismembering
his
own
body
and
shedding
his
blood
on
the
altar
on
the
contrary
a
comfortable
corollary
deduced
from
it
holds
out
to
him
the
pleasing
prospect
of
living
for
the
unspeakable
benefit
of
society
to
a
good
old
age
indeed
of
stretching
out
the
brief
span
of
human
existence
to
a
full
hundred
years
well
is
it
not
only
for
the
priest
but
for
mankind
when
with
the
slow
progress
of
civilization
and
humanity
the
hard
facts
of
a
cruel
ritual
have
thus
been
softened
and
diluted
into
the
nebulous
abstractions
of
a
mystical
theology
note
the
crucifixion
of
christ
an
eminent
scholar
has
recently
pointed
out
the
remarkable
resemblance
between
the
treatment
of
christ
by
the
roman
soldiers
at
jerusalem
and
the
treatment
of
the
mock
king
of
the
saturnalia
by
the
roman
soldiers
at
durostorum
and
he
would
explain
the
similarity
by
supposing
that
the
soldiers
ridiculed
the
claims
of
christ
to
a
divine
kingdom
by
arraying
him
in
the
familiar
garb
of
old
king
saturn
whose
quaint
person
figured
so
prominently
at
the
winter
revels
even
if
the
theory
should
prove
to
be
right
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
christ
played
the
part
of
the
regular
saturn
of
the
year
since
at
the
beginning
of
our
era
the
saturnalia
fell
at
midwinter
whereas
christ
was
crucified
at
the
passover
in
spring
there
is
indeed
as
i
have
pointed
out
some
reason
to
think
that
when
the
roman
year
began
in
march
the
saturnalia
was
held
in
spring
and
that
in
remote
districts
the
festival
always
continued
to
be
celebrated
at
the
ancient
date
if
the
roman
garrison
of
jerusalem
conformed
to
the
old
fashion
in
this
respect
it
seems
not
quite
impossible
that
their
celebration
of
the
saturnalia
may
have
coincided
with
the
passover
and
that
thus
christ
as
a
condemned
criminal
may
have
been
given
up
to
them
to
make
sport
with
as
the
saturn
of
the
year
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
rather
unlikely
that
the
officers
as
representatives
of
the
state
would
have
allowed
their
men
to
hold
the
festival
at
any
but
the
official
date
even
in
the
distant
town
of
durostorum
we
saw
that
the
roman
soldiers
celebrated
the
saturnalia
in
december
thus
if
the
legionaries
at
jerusalem
really
intended
to
mock
christ
by
treating
him
like
the
burlesque
king
of
the
saturnalia
they
probably
did
so
only
by
way
of
a
jest
which
was
in
more
senses
than
one
unseasonable
but
closely
as
the
passion
of
christ
resembles
the
treatment
of
the
mock
king
of
the
saturnalia
it
resembles
still
more
closely
the
treatment
of
the
mock
king
of
the
sacaea
the
description
of
the
mockery
by
matthew
is
the
fullest
it
runs
thus
then
released
he
barabbas
unto
them
and
when
he
had
scourged
jesus
he
delivered
him
to
be
crucified
then
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
took
jesus
into
the
common
hall
and
gathered
unto
him
the
whole
band
of
soldiers
and
they
stripped
him
and
put
on
him
a
scarlet
robe
and
when
they
had
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
they
put
it
upon
his
head
and
a
reed
in
his
right
hand
and
they
bowed
the
knee
before
him
and
mocked
him
saying
hail
king
of
the
jews
and
they
spit
upon
him
and
took
the
reed
and
smote
him
on
the
head
and
after
that
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
the
robe
off
from
him
and
put
his
own
raiment
on
him
and
led
him
away
to
crucify
compare
with
this
the
treatment
of
the
mock
king
of
the
sacaea
as
it
is
described
by
dio
chrysostom
they
take
one
of
the
prisoners
condemned
to
death
and
seat
him
upon
the
king
s
throne
and
give
him
the
king
s
raiment
and
let
him
lord
it
and
drink
and
run
riot
and
use
the
king
s
concubines
during
these
days
and
no
man
prevents
him
from
doing
just
what
he
likes
but
afterwards
they
strip
and
scourge
and
crucify
now
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
remarkable
resemblance
is
after
all
a
mere
coincidence
and
that
christ
was
executed
in
the
ordinary
way
as
a
common
malefactor
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
so
many
scattered
hints
and
indications
of
something
unusual
so
many
broken
lines
seemingly
converging
towards
the
cross
on
calvary
that
it
is
worth
while
to
follow
them
up
and
see
where
they
lead
us
in
attempting
to
draw
these
fragmentary
data
together
to
bridge
the
chasms
and
to
restore
the
shattered
whole
we
must
beware
of
mistaking
hypothesis
for
the
facts
which
it
only
professes
to
cement
yet
even
if
our
hypothesis
should
be
thought
to
bear
a
somewhat
undue
proportion
to
the
facts
the
excess
may
perhaps
be
overlooked
in
consideration
of
the
obscurity
and
the
importance
of
the
enquiry
we
have
seen
reason
to
think
that
the
jewish
festival
of
purim
is
a
continuation
under
a
changed
name
of
the
babylonian
sacaea
and
that
in
celebrating
it
by
the
destruction
of
an
effigy
of
haman
the
modern
jews
have
kept
up
a
reminiscence
of
the
ancient
custom
of
crucifying
or
hanging
a
man
in
the
character
of
a
god
at
the
festival
is
it
not
possible
that
at
an
earlier
time
they
may
like
the
babylonians
themselves
have
regularly
compelled
a
condemned
criminal
to
play
the
tragic
part
and
that
christ
thus
perished
in
the
character
of
haman
the
resemblance
between
the
hanged
haman
and
the
crucified
christ
struck
the
early
christians
themselves
and
whenever
the
jews
destroyed
an
effigy
of
haman
they
were
accused
by
their
christian
neighbours
of
deriding
the
most
sacred
mystery
of
the
new
faith
it
is
probable
that
on
this
painful
subject
the
christians
were
too
sensitive
remembering
the
manner
of
their
founder
s
death
it
was
natural
that
they
should
wince
at
any
pointed
allusion
to
a
cross
a
gallows
or
a
public
execution
even
when
the
shaft
was
not
aimed
at
them
an
objection
to
supposing
that
christ
died
as
the
haman
of
the
year
is
that
according
to
the
gospel
narrative
the
crucifixion
occurred
at
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
nisan
whereas
the
feast
of
purim
at
which
the
hanging
of
haman
would
naturally
take
place
fell
exactly
a
month
earlier
namely
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
i
have
no
wish
to
blink
or
extenuate
the
serious
nature
of
the
difficulty
arising
from
this
discrepancy
of
dates
but
i
would
suggest
some
considerations
which
may
make
us
hesitate
to
decide
that
the
discrepancy
is
fatal
in
the
first
place
it
is
possible
though
perhaps
not
probable
that
christian
tradition
shifted
the
date
of
the
crucifixion
by
a
month
in
order
to
make
the
great
sacrifice
of
the
lamb
of
god
coincide
with
that
annual
sacrifice
of
the
passover
lamb
which
in
the
belief
of
pious
hearts
had
so
long
foreshadowed
it
and
was
thenceforth
to
cease
instances
of
gentle
pressure
brought
to
bear
for
purposes
of
edification
on
stubborn
facts
are
perhaps
not
wholly
unknown
in
the
annals
of
religion
but
the
express
testimony
of
history
is
never
to
be
lightly
set
aside
and
in
the
investigation
of
its
problems
a
solution
which
assumes
the
veracity
and
accuracy
of
the
historian
is
on
an
even
balance
of
probabilities
always
to
be
preferred
to
one
which
impugns
them
both
now
in
the
present
case
we
have
seen
reason
to
think
that
the
babylonian
new
year
festival
of
which
purim
was
a
continuation
did
fall
in
nisan
at
or
near
the
time
of
the
passover
and
that
when
the
jews
borrowed
the
festival
they
altered
the
date
from
nisan
to
adar
in
order
to
prevent
the
new
feast
from
clashing
with
the
old
passover
a
reminiscence
of
the
original
date
of
purim
perhaps
survives
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
in
the
statement
in
the
book
of
esther
that
haman
caused
or
lots
to
be
cast
before
him
from
the
month
of
nisan
onward
it
thus
seems
not
impossible
that
occasionally
for
some
special
reason
the
jews
should
have
celebrated
the
feast
of
purim
or
at
least
the
death
of
haman
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
passover
but
there
is
another
possibility
which
remote
and
fanciful
as
it
may
appear
deserves
at
least
to
be
mentioned
the
mock
king
of
the
saturnalia
whose
resemblance
to
the
dying
christ
was
first
pointed
out
by
wendland
was
allowed
a
period
of
license
of
thirty
days
before
he
was
put
to
death
if
we
could
suppose
that
in
like
manner
the
jews
spared
the
human
representative
of
haman
for
one
month
from
purim
the
date
of
his
execution
would
fall
exactly
on
the
passover
which
if
any
of
these
conjectural
solutions
of
the
difficulty
is
the
true
one
i
will
not
undertake
to
say
i
am
fully
conscious
of
the
doubt
and
uncertainty
that
hang
round
the
whole
subject
and
if
in
this
and
what
follows
i
throw
out
some
hints
and
suggestions
it
is
more
in
the
hope
of
stimulating
and
directing
further
enquiry
than
with
any
expectation
of
reaching
definite
conclusions
it
may
be
objected
that
the
mockery
of
christ
was
done
not
by
the
jews
but
by
the
roman
soldiers
who
knew
and
cared
nothing
about
haman
how
then
can
we
suppose
that
the
purple
or
scarlet
robe
the
sceptre
of
reed
and
the
crown
of
thorns
which
the
soldiers
thrust
upon
christ
were
the
regular
insignia
of
the
haman
of
the
year
to
this
we
may
reply
in
the
first
place
that
even
if
the
legions
stationed
in
syria
were
not
recruited
in
the
country
they
may
have
contracted
some
of
the
native
superstitions
and
have
fallen
in
with
the
local
customs
this
is
not
an
idle
conjecture
we
know
that
the
third
legion
during
its
stay
in
syria
learned
the
syrian
custom
of
saluting
the
rising
sun
and
that
this
formal
salute
performed
by
the
whole
regiment
as
one
man
at
a
critical
moment
of
the
great
battle
of
bedriacum
actually
helped
to
turn
the
scale
when
the
fortune
of
empire
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
garrison
of
jerusalem
really
shared
the
beliefs
and
prejudices
of
the
mob
whom
they
overawed
soldiers
everywhere
are
ready
to
go
with
a
crowd
bent
on
sport
without
asking
any
curious
questions
as
to
the
history
or
quality
of
the
entertainment
and
we
should
probably
do
the
humanity
of
roman
soldiers
too
much
honour
if
we
imagined
that
they
would
be
deterred
by
any
qualm
of
conscience
from
joining
in
the
pastime
which
is
still
so
popular
of
baiting
a
jew
to
death
but
in
the
second
place
it
should
be
observed
that
according
to
one
of
the
evangelists
it
was
not
the
soldiers
of
pilate
who
mocked
jesus
but
the
soldiers
of
herod
and
we
may
fairly
assume
that
herod
s
guards
were
jews
the
hypothesis
that
the
crucifixion
with
all
its
cruel
mockery
was
not
a
punishment
specially
devised
for
christ
but
was
merely
the
fate
that
annually
befell
the
malefactor
who
played
haman
appears
to
go
some
way
towards
relieving
the
gospel
narrative
of
certain
difficulties
which
otherwise
beset
it
if
as
we
read
in
the
gospels
pilate
was
really
anxious
to
save
the
innocent
man
whose
fine
bearing
seems
to
have
struck
him
what
was
to
hinder
him
from
doing
so
he
had
the
power
of
life
and
death
why
should
he
not
have
exercised
it
on
the
side
of
mercy
if
his
own
judgment
inclined
that
way
his
reluctant
acquiescence
in
the
importunate
demand
of
the
rabble
becomes
easier
to
understand
if
we
assume
that
custom
obliged
him
annually
at
this
season
to
give
up
to
them
a
prisoner
on
whom
they
might
play
their
cruel
pranks
on
this
assumption
pilate
had
no
power
to
prevent
the
sacrifice
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
choose
the
victim
again
consider
the
remarkable
statement
of
the
evangelists
that
pilate
set
up
over
the
cross
a
superscription
stating
that
the
man
who
hung
on
it
was
king
of
the
jews
is
it
likely
that
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
a
roman
governor
with
the
fear
of
the
jealous
and
suspicious
old
emperor
before
his
eyes
would
have
ventured
even
in
mockery
to
blazon
forth
a
seditious
claim
of
this
sort
unless
it
were
the
regular
formula
employed
on
such
occasions
recognized
by
custom
and
therefore
not
liable
to
be
misconstrued
into
treason
by
the
malignity
of
informers
and
the
fears
of
a
tyrant
but
if
the
tragedy
of
the
aspirant
after
royal
honours
was
annually
enacted
at
jerusalem
by
a
prisoner
who
perished
on
the
cross
it
becomes
probable
that
the
part
of
his
successful
rival
was
also
played
by
another
actor
who
paraded
in
the
same
kingly
trappings
but
did
not
share
the
same
fate
if
jesus
was
the
haman
of
the
year
where
was
the
mordecai
perhaps
we
may
find
him
in
barabbas
we
are
told
by
the
evangelists
that
at
the
feast
which
witnessed
the
crucifixion
of
christ
it
was
the
custom
for
the
roman
governor
to
release
one
prisoner
whomsoever
the
people
desired
and
that
pilate
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
jesus
attempted
to
persuade
the
multitude
to
choose
him
as
the
man
who
should
go
free
but
hounded
on
by
the
priests
and
elders
who
had
marked
out
jesus
for
destruction
the
rabble
would
not
hear
of
this
and
clamoured
for
the
blood
of
jesus
while
they
demanded
the
release
of
a
certain
miscreant
by
name
barabbas
who
lay
in
gaol
for
murder
and
sedition
accordingly
pilate
had
to
give
way
christ
was
crucified
and
barabbas
set
at
liberty
now
what
we
may
ask
was
the
reason
for
setting
free
a
prisoner
at
this
festival
in
the
absence
of
positive
information
we
may
conjecture
that
the
whose
cage
was
thrown
open
at
this
time
had
to
purchase
his
freedom
by
performing
some
service
from
which
decent
people
would
shrink
such
a
service
may
very
well
have
been
that
of
going
about
the
streets
rigged
out
in
tawdry
splendour
with
a
tinsel
crown
on
his
head
and
a
sham
sceptre
in
his
hand
preceded
and
followed
by
all
the
and
bobtail
of
the
town
hooting
jeering
and
breaking
coarse
jests
at
his
expense
while
some
pretended
to
salaam
his
mock
majesty
and
others
belaboured
the
donkey
on
which
he
rode
it
was
in
this
fashion
probably
that
in
persia
the
beardless
and
man
made
his
undignified
progress
through
the
town
to
the
delight
of
ragamuffins
and
the
terror
of
shopkeepers
whose
goods
he
unceremoniously
confiscated
if
they
did
not
hasten
to
lay
their
at
his
feet
so
perhaps
the
ruffian
barabbas
when
his
irons
were
knocked
off
and
the
prison
door
had
grated
on
its
hinges
to
let
him
forth
tasted
the
first
sweets
of
liberty
in
this
public
manner
even
if
he
was
not
suffered
like
his
brother
to
make
raids
with
impunity
on
the
stalls
of
the
merchants
and
the
tables
of
the
a
curious
confirmation
of
this
conjecture
is
supplied
by
a
passage
in
the
writings
of
philo
the
jew
who
lived
at
alexandria
in
the
time
of
christ
he
tells
us
that
when
agrippa
the
grandson
of
herod
had
received
the
crown
of
judaea
from
caligula
at
rome
the
new
king
passed
through
alexandria
on
his
way
to
his
own
country
the
disorderly
populace
of
that
great
city
animated
by
a
hearty
dislike
of
his
nation
seized
the
opportunity
of
venting
their
spite
by
publicly
defaming
and
ridiculing
the
jewish
monarch
among
other
things
they
laid
hold
of
a
certain
harmless
lunatic
named
carabas
who
used
to
roam
the
streets
stark
naked
the
butt
and
of
urchins
and
idlers
this
poor
wretch
they
set
up
in
a
public
place
clapped
a
paper
crown
on
his
head
thrust
a
broken
reed
into
his
hand
by
way
of
a
sceptre
and
having
huddled
a
mat
instead
of
a
royal
robe
about
his
naked
body
and
surrounded
him
with
a
guard
of
they
did
obeisance
to
him
as
to
a
king
and
made
a
show
of
taking
his
opinion
on
questions
of
law
and
policy
to
point
the
jest
unmistakably
at
the
syrian
king
agrippa
the
bystanders
raised
cries
of
marin
marin
which
they
understood
to
be
the
syrian
word
for
this
mockery
of
the
jewish
king
closely
resembles
the
mockery
of
christ
and
the
joke
such
as
it
was
would
receive
a
keener
edge
if
we
could
suppose
that
the
of
alexandria
were
familiar
with
the
jewish
practice
of
setting
up
a
sham
king
on
certain
occasions
and
that
they
meant
by
implication
to
ridicule
the
real
king
agrippa
by
comparing
him
to
his
holiday
counterfeit
may
we
go
a
step
further
and
conjecture
that
one
at
least
of
the
titles
of
the
mock
king
of
the
jews
was
regularly
barabbas
the
poor
imbecile
who
masqueraded
in
a
paper
crown
at
alexandria
was
probably
a
jew
otherwise
the
jest
would
have
lost
much
of
its
point
and
his
name
according
to
the
greek
manuscripts
of
philo
was
carabas
but
carabas
is
meaningless
in
hebrew
whereas
barabbas
is
a
regularly
formed
hebrew
word
meaning
son
of
the
the
palaeographic
difference
between
the
two
forms
is
slight
and
perhaps
we
shall
hardly
be
deemed
very
rash
if
we
conjecture
that
in
the
passage
in
question
philo
himself
wrote
barabbas
which
a
greek
copyist
ignorant
of
hebrew
afterwards
corrupted
into
carabas
if
this
were
granted
we
should
still
have
to
assume
that
both
philo
and
the
authors
of
the
gospels
fell
into
the
mistake
of
treating
as
the
name
of
an
individual
what
in
fact
was
a
title
of
office
thus
the
hypothesis
which
with
great
diffidence
i
would
put
forward
for
consideration
is
this
it
was
customary
we
may
suppose
with
the
jews
at
purim
or
perhaps
occasionally
at
passover
to
employ
two
prisoners
to
act
the
parts
respectively
of
haman
and
mordecai
in
the
which
formed
a
central
feature
of
the
festival
both
men
paraded
for
a
short
time
in
the
insignia
of
royalty
but
their
fates
were
different
for
while
at
the
end
of
the
performance
the
one
who
played
haman
was
hanged
or
crucified
the
one
who
personated
mordecai
and
bore
in
popular
parlance
the
title
of
barabbas
was
allowed
to
go
free
pilate
perceiving
the
trumpery
nature
of
the
charges
brought
against
jesus
tried
to
persuade
the
jews
to
let
him
play
the
part
of
barabbas
which
would
have
saved
his
life
but
the
merciful
attempt
failed
and
jesus
perished
on
the
cross
in
the
character
of
haman
the
description
of
his
last
triumphal
ride
into
jerusalem
reads
almost
like
an
echo
of
that
brilliant
progress
through
the
streets
of
susa
which
haman
aspired
to
and
mordecai
accomplished
and
the
account
of
the
raid
which
he
immediately
afterwards
made
upon
the
stalls
of
the
hucksters
and
in
the
temple
may
raise
a
question
whether
we
have
not
here
a
trace
of
those
arbitrary
rights
over
property
which
it
has
been
customary
on
such
occasions
to
accord
to
the
temporary
king
if
it
be
asked
why
one
of
these
temporary
kings
should
bear
the
remarkable
title
of
barabbas
or
son
of
the
father
i
can
only
surmise
that
the
title
may
perhaps
be
a
relic
of
the
time
when
the
real
king
the
deified
man
used
to
redeem
his
own
life
by
deputing
his
son
to
reign
for
a
short
time
and
to
die
in
his
stead
we
have
seen
that
the
custom
of
sacrificing
the
son
for
the
father
was
common
if
not
universal
among
semitic
peoples
and
if
we
are
right
in
our
interpretation
of
the
passover
that
traditional
date
of
the
the
very
season
when
the
dreadful
sacrifice
of
the
was
consummated
hence
barabbas
or
the
son
of
the
father
would
be
a
natural
enough
title
for
the
man
or
child
who
reigned
and
died
as
a
substitute
for
his
royal
sire
even
in
later
times
when
the
father
provided
a
less
precious
substitute
than
his
own
offspring
it
would
be
quite
in
accordance
with
the
formal
conservatism
of
religion
that
the
old
title
should
be
retained
after
it
had
ceased
to
be
appropriate
indeed
the
efficacy
of
the
sacrifice
might
be
thought
to
require
and
justify
the
pious
fiction
that
the
substitute
was
the
very
son
of
that
divine
father
who
should
have
died
but
who
preferred
to
live
for
the
good
of
his
people
if
in
the
time
of
christ
as
i
have
conjectured
the
title
of
barabbas
or
son
of
the
father
was
bestowed
on
the
mordecai
the
mock
king
who
lived
rather
than
on
the
haman
the
mock
king
who
died
at
the
festival
this
distinction
can
hardly
have
been
original
for
at
first
we
may
suppose
the
same
man
served
in
both
capacities
at
different
times
as
the
mordecai
of
one
year
and
the
haman
of
the
next
the
two
characters
as
i
have
attempted
to
shew
are
probably
nothing
but
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
deity
considered
at
one
time
as
dead
and
at
another
as
risen
hence
the
human
being
who
personated
the
risen
god
would
in
due
time
after
he
had
enjoyed
his
divine
honours
for
a
season
act
the
dead
god
by
dying
in
good
earnest
in
his
own
person
for
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
of
the
ordinary
that
he
should
play
the
two
parts
in
the
reverse
order
by
dying
first
and
coming
to
life
afterwards
in
both
parts
the
substitute
would
still
be
whether
in
sober
fact
or
in
pious
fiction
the
barabbas
or
son
of
that
divine
father
who
generously
gave
his
own
son
to
die
for
the
world
to
conclude
this
speculation
into
which
i
have
perhaps
been
led
by
the
interest
and
importance
of
the
subject
somewhat
deeper
than
the
evidence
warrants
i
venture
to
urge
in
its
favour
that
it
seems
to
shed
fresh
light
on
some
of
the
causes
which
contributed
to
the
remarkably
rapid
diffusion
of
christianity
in
asia
minor
we
know
from
a
famous
letter
of
the
younger
pliny
addressed
to
the
emperor
trajan
in
the
year
that
by
the
beginning
of
our
era
less
than
a
hundred
years
after
the
founder
s
death
christianity
had
made
such
strides
in
bithynia
and
pontus
that
not
only
cities
but
villages
and
rural
districts
were
affected
by
it
and
that
multitudes
of
both
sexes
and
of
every
age
and
every
rank
professed
its
tenets
indeed
things
had
gone
so
far
that
the
temples
were
almost
deserted
the
sacred
rites
of
the
public
religion
discontinued
and
hardly
a
purchaser
could
be
found
for
the
sacrificial
victims
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
the
new
faith
had
elements
in
it
which
appealed
powerfully
to
the
asiatic
mind
what
these
elements
were
the
present
investigation
has
perhaps
to
some
extent
disclosed
we
have
seen
that
the
conception
of
the
dying
and
risen
god
was
no
new
one
in
these
regions
all
over
western
asia
from
time
immemorial
the
mournful
death
and
happy
resurrection
of
a
divine
being
appear
to
have
been
annually
celebrated
with
alternate
rites
of
bitter
lamentation
and
exultant
joy
and
through
the
veil
which
mythic
fancy
has
woven
round
this
tragic
figure
we
can
still
detect
the
features
of
those
great
yearly
changes
in
earth
and
sky
which
under
all
distinctions
of
race
and
religion
must
always
touch
the
natural
human
heart
with
alternate
emotions
of
gladness
and
regret
because
they
exhibit
on
the
vastest
scale
open
to
our
observation
the
mysterious
struggle
between
life
and
death
but
man
has
not
always
been
willing
to
watch
passively
this
momentous
conflict
he
has
felt
that
he
has
too
great
a
stake
in
its
issue
to
stand
by
with
folded
hands
while
it
is
being
fought
out
he
has
taken
sides
against
the
forces
of
death
and
flung
into
the
trembling
scale
all
the
weight
of
his
puny
person
and
has
exulted
in
his
fancied
strength
when
the
great
balance
has
slowly
inclined
towards
the
side
of
life
little
knowing
that
for
all
his
strenuous
efforts
he
can
as
little
stir
that
balance
by
a
hair
as
can
the
primrose
on
a
mossy
bank
in
spring
or
the
dead
leaf
blown
by
the
chilly
breath
of
autumn
nowhere
do
these
efforts
vain
and
pitiful
yet
pathetic
appear
to
have
been
made
more
persistently
and
systematically
than
in
western
asia
in
name
they
varied
from
place
to
place
but
in
substance
they
were
all
alike
a
man
whom
the
fond
imagination
of
his
worshippers
invested
with
the
attributes
of
a
god
gave
his
life
for
the
life
of
the
world
after
infusing
from
his
own
body
a
fresh
current
of
vital
energy
into
the
stagnant
veins
of
nature
he
was
cut
off
from
among
the
living
before
his
failing
strength
should
initiate
a
universal
decay
and
his
place
was
taken
by
another
who
played
like
all
his
predecessors
the
drama
of
the
divine
resurrection
and
death
such
a
drama
if
our
interpretation
of
it
is
right
was
the
original
story
of
esther
and
mordecai
or
to
give
them
their
older
names
of
ishtar
and
marduk
it
was
played
in
babylonia
and
from
babylonia
the
returning
captives
brought
it
to
judaea
where
it
was
acted
rather
as
an
historical
than
a
mythical
piece
by
players
who
having
to
die
in
grim
earnest
on
a
cross
or
gallows
were
naturally
drawn
rather
from
the
gaol
than
the
a
chain
of
causes
which
because
we
can
not
follow
them
might
in
the
loose
language
of
daily
life
be
called
an
accident
determined
that
the
part
of
the
dying
god
in
this
annual
play
should
be
thrust
upon
jesus
of
nazareth
whom
the
enemies
he
had
made
in
high
places
by
his
outspoken
strictures
were
resolved
to
put
out
of
the
way
they
succeeded
in
ridding
themselves
of
the
popular
and
troublesome
preacher
but
the
very
step
by
which
they
fancied
they
had
simultaneously
stamped
out
his
revolutionary
doctrines
contributed
more
than
anything
else
they
could
have
done
to
scatter
them
broadcast
not
only
over
judaea
but
over
asia
for
it
impressed
upon
what
had
been
hitherto
mainly
an
ethical
mission
the
character
of
a
divine
revelation
culminating
in
the
passion
and
death
of
the
incarnate
son
of
a
heavenly
father
in
this
form
the
story
of
the
life
and
death
of
jesus
exerted
an
influence
which
it
could
never
have
had
if
the
great
teacher
had
died
as
is
commonly
supposed
the
death
of
a
vulgar
malefactor
it
shed
round
the
cross
on
calvary
a
halo
of
divinity
which
multitudes
saw
and
worshipped
afar
off
the
blow
struck
on
golgotha
set
a
thousand
expectant
strings
vibrating
in
unison
wherever
men
had
heard
the
old
old
story
of
the
dying
and
risen
god
every
year
as
another
spring
bloomed
and
another
autumn
faded
across
the
earth
the
field
had
been
ploughed
and
sown
and
borne
fruit
of
a
kind
till
it
received
that
seed
which
was
destined
to
spring
up
and
overshadow
the
world
in
the
great
army
of
martyrs
who
in
many
ages
and
in
many
lands
not
in
asia
only
have
died
a
cruel
death
in
the
character
of
gods
the
devout
christian
will
doubtless
discern
types
and
forerunners
of
the
coming
that
heralded
in
the
morning
sky
the
advent
of
the
sun
of
vessels
wherein
it
pleased
the
divine
wisdom
to
set
before
hungering
souls
the
bread
of
heaven
the
sceptic
on
the
other
hand
with
equal
confidence
will
reduce
jesus
of
nazareth
to
the
level
of
a
multitude
of
other
victims
of
a
barbarous
superstition
and
will
see
in
him
no
more
than
a
moral
teacher
whom
the
fortunate
accident
of
his
execution
invested
with
the
crown
not
merely
of
a
martyr
but
of
a
god
the
divergence
between
these
views
is
wide
and
deep
which
of
them
is
the
truer
and
will
in
the
end
prevail
time
will
decide
the
question
of
prevalence
if
not
of
truth
yet
we
would
fain
believe
that
in
this
and
in

things
the

dussaud
argues
that
the
stones
deposited
at
shrines
of
holy
men
are
simply
material
embodiments
of
the
prayers
which
at
the
same
time
the
suppliants
address
to
the
saints
and
he
holds
that
the
practice
of
depositing
stones
at
such
places
rests
on
a
principle
entirely
different
from
that
of
throwing
stones
for
the
purpose
of
repelling
evil
spirits

if
i
am
right
the
fundamental
idea
in
these
customs
is
neither
that
the
stones
or
sticks
are
offerings
presented
to
good
spirits
nor
that
they
are
missiles
hurled
at
bad
ones
but
that
they
embody
the
evil
whether
disease
misfortune
fear
horror
or
what
not
of
which
the
person
attempts
to
rid
himself
by
transferring
it
to
a
material
vehicle
but
i
am
far
from
confident
that
this
explanation
applies
to
all
cases
in
particular
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
it
with
the
custom
described
in
the
text
of
throwing
a
marked
stone
at
a
holy
man
and
then
recovering
it
are
we
to
suppose
that
the
stone
carries
away
the
evil
to
the
good
man
and
brings
back
his
blessing
instead
the
idea
is
perhaps
too
subtle
and
the
word
which
in
north
africa
describes
the
powerful
and
in
general
beneficent
yet
dangerous
influence
which
emanates
from
holy
persons
and
things
is
no
doubt
identical
with
the
hebrew
ברכה
the
importance
which
the
ancient
hebrews
ascribed
to
the
blessing
or
the
curse
of
a
holy
man
is
familiar
to
us
from
many
passages
in
the
old
testament
see
for
example
genesis
xlviii
deuteronomy
xxvii
xxviii
the
rite
of
throwing
sticks
or
stones
is
perhaps
best
explained
as
a
mode
of
purification
the
evil
being
thought
to
be
embodied
in
the
missile
which
is
thrown
away

from

we

the

call
attention
to
the
uncertainty
which
exists
on

because
modern

perhaps
misunderstanding

of

have
commonly
stated
as
a
fact
what
is
at
best
only
a
more

probable
hypothesis

have

yet
remain
the
powerful
influences
of
the

earlier

faith
to
be
noted

accounted
for
just
as
the
buddhists
of
ceylon
turn
in

sickness
and
danger
not
to
the
consolations
offered
by
the
creed
of

but
to
the
propitiation
of
the
demons
feared
and
reverenced
by
their
early
progenitors
and
just
as
the
burmese
and
talaings

retain
in
full
force
the
whole
of

superstition

the

this

as

to
be
observed
that
some

the

divide

into
two
parts

they
call

about
or
inches
long

somewhat
thicker

two
mornings

and
the
time
when
it
will
appear

disappear
can
be
accurately
predicted
as
a
general
rule
only
a
few
are
found
on
the
first
day
though
occasionally
the
large
quantity
may
appear
first
but
as
a
rule
the
large
quantity
appears
on
the
second
morning
and
it
is
only
found
on
these
mornings
for
a
very
limited
period
viz
from
early
dawn
to
about
seven
o
clock
for
about
two
hours
it
then
disappears
until
the
following
year
except
in

rare
instances
when
it
is

period

kept
records
of
the
time

the

only
from

was
celebrated
in

apparently
does
not
deny
the
antiquity
of
the
festival
in
a
simpler
form

in

says
in

an

general
remarks
first
the
immediate
and
the
mediate
expulsions
of
evil
are
identical
in
intention
second
the
annual
expulsion
of
evil
generally
coincides
with
some
change
of
season
such
as
the
beginning
or
end
of
winter
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
rainy
season
etc
third
the
annual
expulsion
of
evil
is
commonly
preceded
or
followed
by
a
period
of
general
license
in
the
dassera
festival
as
celebrated
in
nepaul
we
seem
to
have
another
instance
of
the
annual
expulsion
of
demons
preceded
by
a
time
of
license
the
festival
occurs
at
the
beginning
of
october
and
lasts
ten
days
during
its
continuance
there
is
a
general
holiday
among
all
classes
of
the
people
the
city
of
kathmandu
at
this
time
is
required
to
be
purified
but
the
purification
is
effected
rather
by
prayer
than
by
all
the
courts
of
law
are
closed
and
all
prisoners
in
jail
are
removed
from
the
precincts
of
the
city
the
kalendar
is
cleared
or
there
is
a
always
at
the
dassera
of
all
this
seems
a
trace
of
a
period
of
license
at
this
time
it
is
a
general
custom
for
masters
to
make
an
annual
present
either
of
money
clothes
buffaloes
goats
to
such
servants
as
have
given
satisfaction
during
the
past
year
it
is
in
this
respect
as
well
as
in
the
feasting
and
drinking
which
goes
on
something
like
our
at
on
the
seventh
day
at
sunset
there
is
a
parade
of
all
the
troops
in
the
capital
including
the
artillery
at
a
given
signal
the
regiments
begin
to
fire
the
artillery
takes
it
up
and
a
general
firing
goes
on
for
about
twenty
minutes
when
it
suddenly
ceases
this
probably
represents
the
expulsion
of
the
demons
the
grand
cutting
of
the
is
always
postponed
till
the
dassera
is
over
and
commences
all

this
remarkable
festival
appears
not
to
be
noticed
by
the
other
early
spanish
writers
such
as
sahagun
acosta
and
torquemada
who
have
given
us
detailed
descriptions
of
the
mexican
festivals
it
might
perhaps
have
been
conjectured
that
duran
was
here
describing
the
similar
festival
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
see
above
pp
which
fell
about
the
same
time
of
the
year
but
the
conjecture
is
excluded
by
the
simple
fact
that
duran
describes
both
festivals
the
one
immediately
after
the
other
assigning
as
their
dates
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
of
september
respectively
ii
almost
nothing
is
known
about
duran

that
he
was
a
spanish
monk

native

had
weak
health
and
died

it
was
edited

the
original
manuscript
is
preserved
in
the
natìonal
library
at
madrid
the
accounts
contained
in
his
history
bear
internal
marks
of
authenticity
and
are
in
general
supported
by
the
independent
testimony
of
the
other
early
spanish
authorities

of
the
human

the

of

the

suppose
that

that
the

an

is

reasons
for
identifying
the
sacaea
with
zakmuk
on
this
subject
the
master
of
catharine
s
college
cambridge
the
rev
johns
has
kindly
furnished
me
with
the
following
note
zag
is
the
name
of
the
ideogram
meaning
head
or
mu
is
the
sign
for
when
put
together
means
beginning
of
but
means
zag
zag
with
mu
suffixed
therefore
it
is
the
name
of
the
ideogram
and
there
is
as
yet
no
that
it
was
ever
read
zakmuk
hence
any
similarity
of
sound
with
either
sacaea
or
zoganes
is
precarious
i
can
not
prove
that
the
signs
were
read
zakmuku
but
that
is
not
a
semitic
word
nor
a
sumerian
the
statement
occurs

the
title
of
the
president

divine
synod
king

gods

is
believed
by

zimmern
to
have
originally
referred
to
the
god
nabu
though
at
a
later
time
it
was
applied
to
marduk
a
difficulty
in
identifying
the
sacaea
with
zakmuk
is
that
the
two
festivals
seem
to
have
been
celebrated
at
different
times
of
the
year
zakmuk
falling
in
march
and
the
sacaea
in
july
suggested
ways
of
meeting
the
difficulty

note
on
the
other
hand
zimmern
prefers
to
suppose
that
the
sacaea
was
quite
distinct
from
zakmuk
and
that
it
fell
in
july
at
the
time
of
the
heliacal
rising
of

seems
to
have

between

such
a

appears
undoubtedly
to
exist
between
some
of

and

the

the

seems
to
be
a
contrast
between
the
annual
death
of
nature
in
winter
and
its
revival
in
spring
the
goddess
ishtar
certainly
seems
to
have
embodied
the
principle
of
fertility
in
animals
as
well
as
in
plants
for
in
the
poem
which
describes
her
descent
into
the
world
of
the
dead
it
is
said
that
the
mistress
ishtar
had
descended
to
the
land

the

not
mount

did
the

the
interpretation
here
given
of
the
four
principal
personages
in
the
book
of
esther
was
suggested
by
me
in
the
second
edition
of
this
book
it
agrees
substantially
with
the
one
which
has
since
been
adopted
by
professor
zimmern
in
schrader
s
keilinschriften
und
das
alte
berlin
and
by
professor
haupt
leipsic
pp
in
this
connexion
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
among
the
ancient
persians
marriages
are
said
to
have
been
usually
celebrated
at
the
vernal
equinox
strabo
xv
the
five
days
duration
of
the
mock
king
s
reign
may
possibly
have
been
an
intercalary
period
introduced
as
in
ancient
egypt
and
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
equalizing
a
year
of
days
twelve
months
of
days
each
to
a
solar
year
reckoned
at
days
see
above
pp
however
the
legend
that
semiramis
burned
herself
on
a
pyre
in
babylon
for
grief
at
the
loss
of
a
favourite
horse
hyginus
compare
pliny

may
perhaps
point
to
an
old
custom
of
compelling
the
human
representative
of
the
goddess
to
perish
in
the
flames
we
have
seen
above
that
one
of
the
lovers
of
ishtar
had
the
form
of
a
horse
hence
the
legend
recorded
by
hyginus
is
a
fresh
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
which
binds
semiramis
to
ishtar
wide
prevalence
of
festivals
like
the
saturnalia
in
antiquity
such
festivals
seem
to
have
been
held
by
agricultural
communities
for
the
good
of
the
crops
and
at
them
the
king
or
his
substitute
appears
to
have
personated
the
god
of
fertility
and
to
have
been
put
to
death
in
that
character
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
god
should
rise
from
the
dead
with
renewed
youth
and
vigour
the
festivals
point
to
a
remarkable
homogeneity
of
civilization

uncertain
hence
i
have
removed
it
from

preserved
it
as
an
appendix
on
the
chance
that
under
a
pile
of
conjectures
it
contains
some
grains
of
truth
which
may
ultimately
contribute
to
a
solution
of
the
problem
as
my
views
on
this
subject
appear
to
have
been
strangely
misunderstood
i
desire
to
point
out
explicitly
that
my
theory
assumes
the
historical
reality
of
jesus
of
nazareth
as
a
great
religious
and
moral
teacher
who
founded
christianity
and
was
crucified
at
jerusalem
under
the
governorship
of
pontius
pilate
the
testimony
of
the
gospels
confirmed
by
the
hostile
evidence
of
tacitus
xv
and
the
younger
pliny
x
appears
amply
sufficient
to
establish
these
facts
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
unprejudiced
enquirers
it
is
only
the
details
of
the
life
and
death
of
christ
that
remain
and
will
probably
always
remain
shrouded
in
the
mists
of
uncertainty
the
doubts
which
have
been
cast
on
the
historical
reality
of
jesus
are
in
my
judgment
unworthy
of
serious
attention
quite
apart
from
the
positive
evidence
of
history
and
tradition
the
origin
of
a
great
religious
and
moral
reform
is
inexplicable
without
the
personal
existence
of
a
great
reformer
to
dissolve
the
founder
of
christianity
into
a
myth
as
some
would
do
is
hardly
less
absurd
than
it
would
be
to
do
the
same
for
mohammed
luther
and
calvin
such
dissolving
views
are
for
the
most
part
the
dreams
of
students
who
know
the
great
world
chiefly
through
its
pale
reflection
in
books

extravagances
of

resemblance

struck
me
when
i
wrote
this
book
originally
but
as
i
could
not
definitely
explain
it
i
preferred
to
leave
it
unnoticed
the
first
in
recent
years
to
call
attention
to
the
resemblance
seems
to
have
been
paton
who
further
conjectured
that
the
crucifixion
of
christ
between
two
malefactors
was
not
accidental
but
had
a
ritual
significance
as
an
expiatory
sacrifice

it

the

have

man
in
the

may
have
perished
in
that
character
but
the
passover
at
which
christ
was
crucified
fell
a
month
after

perhaps
the
annual
haman
like
the
annual
saturn
was
allowed

s
license
before
being
put
to

see
above
the
extreme
improbability
involved
in
the
suggested
transference
of
the
date
of
the
crucifixion
is
rightly
emphasized
by
my
colleague
and
friend
professor
in
some
observations
and
criticisms
with
which
he
has
favoured
me
he
writes
i
regard
it
as
out
of
the
question
that

shifted
the
date
of
the
crucifixion

a
you
yourself
regard
it
as
improbable
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
impossible
all
that
we
hear
of
the
passion
is
only
explicable
by
the
passover
festival
and
by
the
circumstance
that
at
that
time
every
believing
jew
had
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
without
the
background
of
the
festival
all
that
we
know

the

of

in

versions

the

the
theory
that
christ
was
put
to
death
not
as
a
criminal
but
as
the
annual
representative
of
a
god
whose
counterparts
were
well
known
all
over
western
asia
may
help
to
explain
his
early
deification
and
the
rapid
spread
of
his
worship
pliny
x
the
province
which
pliny
governed
was

professor
ramsay
is
of
opinion
that
the
description
of
the
great
power
acquired
by
the
new
religion
in
the
province
applies
to
eastern
pontus
at
the
chief
religious
centre
of
this
district
appears
to
have
been
the
great
sanctuary
of
anaitis
or
semiramis
at
zela
to
which
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
call
the
reader
s
attention
strabo
tells
us
xii
that
all
the
people
of
pontus
took
their
most
solemn
oaths
at
this
shrine
in
the
same
district
there
was
another
very
popular
sanctuary
of
a
similar
type
at
comana
where
the
worship
of
a
native
goddess
called
ma
was
carried
on
by
a
host
of
sacred
harlots
and
by
a
high
priest
who
wore
a
diadem
and
was
second
only
to
the
king
in
rank
at
the
festivals
of
the
goddess
crowds
of
men
and
women
flocked
into
comana
from
all
the
region
round
about
from
the
country
as
well
as
from
the
cities
the
luxury
and
debauchery
of
this
holy
town
suggest
to
strabo
a
comparison
with
the
famous
or
rather
infamous
corinth
see
strabo
xii
and
compared
with
xii
such
were
some
of
the
in
which
the
seeds
of
christianity
first
struck
root
