out
of

contrariness
perhaps
the

is

what
if
it

to

for
the

how

of

what
if
there
be
only
one
natural
law
manifesting
itself
as
yet
to
us
in
many
facets
because
we
can
not
apperceive

whole
of
which
we
have
gained
only
the
most
elementary
glimpses
with
which
we
can
cope
only
at
the
crudest
level
are
those
still
other
doors
yet
undefined
on
down
the
corridor
one
minute
after
the
regular
report
call
from
the
planet
eden
was
overdue
the
communications
operator
summoned
his
supervisor
his
finger
hesitated
over
the
key
reluctantly
then
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
pressed
it
down
the
supervisor
came
boiling
out
of
his
cubicle
down
the
long
aisle
between
the
forty
operators
hunched
over
their
panels
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
quarreled
even
before
he
came
to
a
stop
eden
due
overdue
the
operator
tried
to
make
it
laconic
but
it
came
out
sullen
the
supervisor
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
knuckles
and
punched
irritably
at
some
buttons
on
an
astrocalculator
an
star
map
lit
up
the
big
screen
at
the
end
of
the
room
he
did
expect
there
to
be
any
occlusions
to
interfere
with
the
communications
channel
the
astrophysicists
did
set
up
reporting
schedules
to
include
such
blunders
but
he
had
to
check
there
were
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
exasperation
trouble
always
had
to
come
on
his
shift
never
anybody
else
lazy
colonists
probably
neglecting
to
check
in
on
time
he
rationalized
cynically
to
the
operator
he
rubbed
his
long
nose
and
hoped
the
operator
would
agree
that
all
it
was
the
operator
looked
skeptical
instead
eden
was
still
under
the
first
test
experimental
colonists
were
arrogant
they
were
zany
they
were
a
lot
of
things
some
unprintable
which
qualified
them
for
being
test
colonizers
and
nothing
else
apparently
they
were
almost
as
much
of
a
problem
as
the
extrapolators
but
they
were
lazy
they
did
forget
some
fool
ship
captain
has
probably
messed
up
communications
by
inserting
a
jump
band
of
his
own
the
supervisor
hopefully
tried
out
another
idea
even
to
him
it
sounded
weak
a
jump
band
did
last
more
than
an
instant
and
no
ship
captain
would
risk
his
license
by
using
the
e
frequency
anyway
he
looked
hopefully
down
the
long
room
at
the
bent
heads
of
the
other
operators
at
their
panels
none
was
signaling
an
emergency
to
draw
him
away
from
this
give
him
an
excuse
to
leave
in
the
hope
the
problem
would
have
solved
itself
by
the
time
he
could
get
back
to
it
he
chewed
on
a
knuckle
and
stared
angrily
at
the
operator
who
was
sitting
back
relaxed
looking
at
him
waiting
you
sure
you
tuned
to
the
right
frequency
for
eden
the
supervisor
asked
irritably
you
sure
your
equipment
is
working
the
operator
pulled
a
wry
mouth
shrugged
and
did
bother
to
answer
with
more
than
a
nod
he
allowed
a
slight
expression
of
contempt
for
supervisors
who
asked
silly
questions
to
show
he
caught
the
surreptitious
wink
of
the
operator
at
the
next
panel
behind
the
supervisor
back
the
disturbance
was
beginning
to
attract
attention
in
response
to
the
wink
he
pulled
the
dogged
expression
of
the
unjustly
nagged
employee
over
his
features
well
why
do
you
give
eden
an
alert
then
the
supervisor
muttered
savagely
blast
them
out
of
their
seats
make
get
off
their
their
pants
out
there
the
operator
showed
an
expression
which
plainly
said
it
was
about
time
and
reached
over
to
press
down
the
emergency
key
he
held
it
down
eleven
away
if
one
had
to
depend
upon
impossibly
slow
space
time
a
siren
which
could
be
heard
for
ten
miles
in
eden
atmosphere
should
be
blaring
the
supervisor
stood
and
watched
while
he
transferred
the
gnawing
at
his
knuckles
to
his
fingernails
he
waited
with
apprehensive
satisfaction
for
some
angry
colonist
to
come
through
and
scream
at
them
to
turn
off
that
siren
he
braced
himself
and
worked
up
some
choice
phrases
of
his
own
to
scream
back
at
the
colonist
for
neglecting
his
duty
getting
extrapolation
headquarters
here
on
earth
all
worked
up
over
nothing
he
wondered
if
he
dared
threaten
to
send
an
extrapolator
out
there
to
check
them
over
he
decided
the
threat
would
have
no
punch
an
e
would
pay
no
attention
to
his
recommendation
he
knew
it
and
the
colonist
would
know
it
too
he
began
to
wonder
what
excuse
the
colonist
would
have
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
boys
were
on
your
toes
the
insolent
colonist
would
drawl
probably
something
like
that
he
hoped
the
right
words
would
fail
him
but
there
was
no
response
to
the
siren
lock
the
key
down
he
told
the
operator
keep
it
blasting
until
they
wake
up
he
looked
down
the
room
and
saw
that
a
couple
of
the
near
operators
were
now
frankly
listening
get
on
with
your
work
he
said
loudly
pay
attention
to
what
recording
it
was
enough
to
cause
several
more
heads
to
raise
now
now
now
he
chattered
to
the
room
at
large
this
is
nothing
to
concern
the
rest
of
you
just
a
delayed
report
that
all
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
delayed
report
before
he
should
have
asked
that
because
of
course
they
had
it
was
like
asking
a
mountain
climber
if
he
had
ever
felt
a
taut
rope
over
the
razor
edge
of
a
precipice
suddenly
go
slack
but
there
nothing
any
of
you
can
do
he
said
he
tried
to
cover
the
plaintive
note
by
adding
and
if
you
louse
up
your
own
messages
but
he
had
threatened
them
so
often
that
there
was
no
longer
any
menace
he
spent
the
next
ten
minutes
hauling
out
the
logs
of
eden
to
see
if
they
ever
been
tardy
before
the
logs
covered
two
and
a
fraction
years
two
years
and
four
months
the
scanner
did
pick
up
a
single
symbol
to
show
that
eden
had
been
even
two
seconds
off
schedule
the
first
year
daily
the
second
year
weekly
and
now
monthly
there
was
a
single
hiccough
from
the
machine
to
kick
out
an
extrapolator
signal
to
watch
for
anything
unusual
eden
heretofore
had
presented
about
as
much
of
an
problem
as
an
iowa
cornfield
you
really
sure
your
equipment
is
working
he
asked
again
as
he
came
back
to
stand
behind
the
operator
chair
they
have
answered
yet
the
operator
shrugged
again
it
was
pretty
obvious
the
colonists
answered
and
what
should
he
do
about
it
go
out
there
personally
and
shake
his
finger
at
them
naughty
naughty
well
why
do
you
bounce
a
beam
on
the
planet
surface
to
see
the
supervisor
grumbled
i
want
to
see
an
echo
i
want
to
see
for
myself
that
you
have
let
your
equipment
go
sour
or
maybe
there
a
space
hurricane
between
here
and
there
or
maybe
a
booster
has
blown
or
maybe
some
star
has
exploded
and
warped
things
maybe
well
bounce
it
man
bounce
it
what
are
you
waiting
for
okay
okay
the
operator
grumbled
back
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
give
the
order
he
grimaced
at
the
operator
behind
the
supervisor
i
just
go
bouncing
beams
on
planets
if
i
happen
to
be
in
the
mood
now
now
now
now
no
insubordination
if
you
please
the
supervisor
cautioned
together
they
waited
in
growing
dread
for
the
automatic
relays
strung
out
through
space
to
take
hold
automatically
calculating
the
route
set
up
the
required
bands
it
was
called
instantaneous
communication
but
that
was
only
relative
it
took
time
the
supervisor
was
frowning
deeply
now
he
hated
to
report
to
the
sector
chief
that
an
emergency
had
come
up
which
he
could
handle
he
hated
the
thought
of
extrapolators
poking
around
in
his
department
upsetting
the
routines
asking
questions
he
already
asked
he
hated
the
forethought
of
the
admiration
he
see
in
the
eyes
of
his
operators
when
an
e
walked
into
the
room
the
eagerness
with
which
they
respond
to
questions
the
thrill
of
merely
being
in
the
same
room
he
hated
the
operators
in
advance
for
giving
freely
of
admiration
to
an
e
that
they
withheld
from
him
he
allowed
himself
the
momentary
secret
luxury
of
hating
all
extrapolators
once
upon
a
time
when
he
was
a
kid
he
had
dreamed
of
becoming
an
what
kid
had
he
gone
farther
than
the
wish
he
tried
and
had
been
rebuffed
clinging
to
established
scientific
beliefs
the
tester
had
told
him
with
the
inherent
inescapable
superiority
of
a
man
trying
to
be
kind
to
a
lesser
intelligence
is
like
being
afraid
to
jump
off
a
precipice
in
full
confidence
that
you
think
of
something
to
save
yourself
before
you
hit
bottom
it
might
or
might
not
have
been
figurative
but
he
had
allowed
himself
the
pleasure
of
wishing
the
tester
would
try
it
to
accept
what
eminent
authority
says
as
true
the
tester
had
continued
kindly
would
even
qualify
you
for
being
a
scientist
although
he
added
hopefully
this
would
not
bar
you
from
an
excellent
career
in
engineering
it
was
a
bitter
memory
of
failure
for
if
you
disbelieved
what
science
said
was
true
where
were
you
and
if
it
might
not
be
true
why
was
it
said
even
now
he
shuddered
at
the
chaos
he
would
have
to
face
live
with
no
certainties
on
which
to
stand
he
washed
the
memory
out
of
his
thought
and
concentrated
on
the
flashing
pips
that
chased
themselves
over
the
operator
screen
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
equipment
nothing
wrong
with
the
communication
channels
between
eden
and
earth
blasted
colonists
the
supervisor
muttered
instead
of
a
beam
on
their
planet
i
like
to
bounce
a
rock
on
their
heads
i
bet
let
all
the
sets
at
their
end
get
out
of
order
he
knew
it
was
a
foolish
statement
even
if
the
operator
face
told
him
so
any
emergency
colonist
man
or
woman
and
there
were
fifty
of
them
on
eden
could
build
a
communicator
that
was
regulation
you
sure
there
have
been
any
emergency
calls
from
them
he
asked
the
operator
with
sudden
suspicion
you
not
covering
up
some
neglect
in
not
notifying
me
if
you
covering
up
you
better
tell
me
now
i
find
out
it
all
come
out
in
the
investigation
and
the
operator
turned
around
and
looked
at
him
levelly
he
looked
him
over
with
open
contempt
from
bald
head
to
splayed
feet
then
he
coolly
turned
his
back
there
was
a
limit
to
just
how
much
a
man
could
stand
even
to
hold
a
job
at
e
headquarters
it
was
about
time
the
supervisor
got
somebody
with
brains
onto
the
job
the
sector
chief
should
be
called
immediately
supervisors
were
supposed
to
have
enough
brains
to
think
of
something
so
obvious
as
that
that
much
brains
at
least
the
first
reaction
of
the
sector
chief
to
the
dreaded
words
delayed
report
was
a
shocked
negation
an
illusory
belief
that
it
happen
to
him
to
the
intense
annoyance
of
the
communications
supervisor
his
first
act
was
to
rush
down
to
communications
and
go
through
all
the
routines
for
rousing
the
colonists
the
supervisor
had
tried
his
worry
was
mounting
so
rapidly
that
he
hardly
noticed
the
resigned
expression
of
the
operator
who
knew
he
would
have
to
go
through
all
these
useless
motions
again
and
again
before
it
was
all
over
and
somebody
did
something
well
the
chief
said
to
the
supervisor
it
my
problem
now
he
sighed
and
unconsciously
squared
his
shoulders
yes
chief
hayes
the
supervisor
agreed
quickly
perhaps
too
quickly
with
too
much
relief
well
that
is
i
mean
his
voice
trailed
off
after
all
it
was
you
understand
my
check
of
your
routines
was
no
reflection
on
you
or
your
department
hayes
said
diplomatically
it
a
heavy
responsibility
to
alert
pull
the
scientists
off
who
knows
what
delicate
critical
work
maybe
even
hope
to
get
the
attention
of
an
e
all
that
i
had
to
make
sure
you
know
of
course
chief
hayes
the
supervisor
said
and
relaxed
some
of
his
resentment
serious
matter
he
chattered
disgrace
if
an
e
without
half
trying
put
his
finger
on
our
oversight
we
all
understand
that
he
tried
to
include
the
nearby
operators
his
boys
in
his
eager
agreement
but
they
were
all
busy
showing
how
intensely
they
had
to
concentrate
on
their
work
that
probably
all
it
is
an
oversight
hayes
said
with
unconvincing
reassurance
then
at
the
hurt
look
on
the
supervisor
face
added
beyond
our
control
here
of
course
something
it
would
take
at
least
a
scientist
to
spot
something
we
could
be
expected
what
i
mean
is
we
should
get
alarmed
until
we
know
for
sure
and
ah
keep
it
confidential
of
course
chief
hayes
the
supervisor
said
in
a
near
whisper
he
looked
meaningfully
around
at
the
room
of
operators
but
did
manage
not
to
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
those
who
were
observing
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
were
grateful
for
at
least
that
on
his
way
back
to
his
own
office
chief
william
hayes
reflected
that
the
bit
about
keeping
it
confidential
was
on
the
corny
side
within
fifteen
minutes
he
start
spreading
it
all
over
himself
every
scientist
every
lab
assistant
would
know
it
every
clerk
every
janitor
would
know
it
would
have
to
work
full
blast
all
night
long
and
some
of
the
lesser
personnel
had
homes
down
in
yellow
sands
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
these
would
be
calling
their
husbands
and
wives
telling
them
not
to
fix
dinner
not
to
worry
if
they
did
come
home
all
night
no
matter
how
guarded
the
news
would
leak
out
the
word
spread
and
the
newscast
reporters
would
pick
it
up
for
the
delectation
of
the
public
eden
colony
cut
off
from
communication
nobody
knows
wonder
fear
delicious
exciting
or
was
this
the
kind
of
thinking
that
had
kept
him
from
qualifying
as
an
e
what
was
it
the
examiner
had
asked
hayes
why
do
you
feel
it
is
all
right
for
you
to
view
to
read
to
know
but
that
others
should
be
protected
from
seeing
reading
knowing
what
are
these
sterling
qualities
you
have
that
make
it
all
right
for
you
to
censor
what
would
not
be
right
for
others
he
abruptly
brought
his
mind
back
to
the
present
perhaps
he
first
better
prepare
a
news
statement
before
he
did
anything
else
something
noncommittal
reassuring
no
point
in
getting
the
populace
stirred
up
as
he
sat
down
behind
his
desk
a
big
man
in
a
brown
suit
natural
hair
a
calm
and
administrative
face
he
began
to
realize
that
for
the
next
hours
at
least
he
would
be
in
the
spotlight
well
he
give
a
good
account
of
himself
demonstrate
that
he
had
an
executive
capacity
beyond
the
needs
of
his
present
job
more
than
a
mere
requisition
signer
interoffice
memo
initialer
for
one
thing
the
scientists
would
give
him
trouble
if
he
had
been
deeply
hurt
that
they
thought
he
could
open
up
his
mind
enough
to
become
an
e
what
about
scientists
whose
limits
were
reached
still
farther
along
he
must
remember
to
keep
his
temper
use
persuasion
maybe
kid
them
a
little
the
blasted
experts
were
almost
as
bad
as
e
worse
in
a
way
because
the
e
did
have
to
remind
anybody
of
his
dignity
or
how
important
the
work
was
he
was
doing
but
then
you
never
asked
an
e
to
drop
what
he
was
doing
and
listen
you
never
asked
an
e
to
do
anything
he
either
noticed
and
was
interested
or
he
did
notice
or
was
interested
but
nobody
ever
told
an
e
that
he
must
apply
himself
to
a
problem
once
a
man
became
a
extrapolator
he
was
outside
all
law
all
frameworks
all
duty
all
social
mores
that
was
the
essence
of
e
science
that
any
requirement
outside
of
his
own
making
did
exist
it
had
to
be
that
way
that
kind
of
mind
could
not
tolerate
barriers
but
spent
itself
constantly
in
destroying
them
erect
barriers
of
triviality
and
it
would
waste
its
substance
upon
trivial
matters
the
only
answer
was
to
remove
all
possible
barriers
for
the
e
lest
immersion
in
something
trivial
prevent
that
mind
from
seeking
out
a
barrier
to
knowledge
a
problem
of
significance
but
the
scientists
hayes
sighed
if
only
the
scientists
would
keep
thinking
they
were
cut
from
the
same
cloth
as
the
they
had
to
have
restrictions
organization
imposed
upon
them
yes
indeed
they
grumble
at
being
taken
away
from
their
work
to
assemble
a
review
of
all
the
known
facts
about
eden
a
dead
issue
as
far
as
their
own
work
was
concerned
for
eden
had
been
assayed
and
filed
away
as
solved
they
moan
and
groan
about
having
to
drag
up
the
facts
that
had
been
analyzed
and
settled
long
ago
he
saw
himself
compared
with
the
producer
of
a
show
and
theatrical
performers
did
come
any
more
temperamental
than
scientists
he
be
hearing
about
how
much
of
their
time
he
wasted
for
months
to
come
every
time
any
administrator
asked
why
they
had
produced
whatever
it
was
they
were
working
on
it
would
be
because
chief
hayes
had
interrupted
them
at
the
most
crucial
moment
and
they
had
to
begin
all
over
again
oh
they
drag
their
heels
all
right
and
he
have
to
remind
them
tactfully
that
their
prime
duty
was
to
serve
the
extrapolators
that
they
were
employed
here
only
because
someday
in
some
system
somebody
might
be
able
to
supply
a
key
fact
that
some
e
might
want
to
know
they
ask
him
slyly
what
guarantee
he
had
that
any
e
would
be
listening
if
they
did
produce
a
review
of
the
eden
complex
knowing
he
could
give
no
such
guarantee
they
drag
their
heels
because
deep
down
they
carried
a
basic
resentment
against
the
e
because
experts
though
they
were
each
of
them
somewhere
along
the
line
had
learned
the
bitter
limits
in
his
mind
that
prevented
him
from
going
on
to
become
an
they
drag
their
heels
because
the
e
each
blasted
one
of
them
would
regard
the
absolutely
true
facts
proved
beyond
question
by
science
with
an
attitude
of
skepticism
temporarily
accepting
the
uncontestably
immutable
as
only
provisionary
and
probably
quite
wrong
oh
they
grumble
and
they
drag
their
heels
at
first
but
they
would
get
into
it
they
get
into
it
not
because
the
sector
chief
had
babied
them
along
kidded
them
coaxed
them
but
because
as
surely
as
his
name
was
bill
hayes
some
unprintable
e
would
ask
a
question
for
which
they
had
no
answer
or
even
worse
some
question
that
made
no
sense
but
left
the
scientist
feeling
that
perhaps
it
should
have
that
was
the
e
brand
of
thinking
which
gave
everybody
trouble
and
without
which
man
could
never
have
gone
on
creeping
outward
and
outward
among
the
stars
every
new
planet
or
subplanet
or
sun
or
blasted
asteroid
seemed
to
call
for
some
revision
of
known
laws
sometimes
an
entirely
new
system
had
to
be
resolved
oh
science
was
easy
a
veritable
snap
while
man
crawled
around
on
the
muddy
bottom
of
his
ocean
of
air
and
concluded
that
throughout
all
the
universe
things
must
conform
to
his
then
notion
of
what
they
must
be
as
ignorant
as
a
damned
halibut
must
be
of
the
works
and
thoughts
of
man
and
often
the
e
was
unable
to
resolve
the
system
which
was
simply
a
euphemistic
way
of
saying
that
he
did
come
back
and
without
him
man
could
go
no
farther
an
e
therefore
was
the
rarest
and
most
valuable
piece
of
property
in
the
universe
whatever
else
man
might
be
he
will
go
to
any
lengths
to
protect
the
value
of
his
property
all
right
bill
perhaps
a
part
of
that
is
true
but
give
the
scientists
their
full
due
they
work
with
a
will
once
they
grew
aware
of
the
need
of
it
because
they
were
just
as
concerned
as
anybody
else
with
what
might
have
happened
to
those
colonists
but
first
they
would
argue
his
secretary
interrupted
his
thought
by
coming
in
from
her
own
office
she
had
an
stack
of
cards
in
her
hand
here
that
batch
of
scientists
who
worked
on
the
original
eden
survey
she
said
so
many
hayes
asked
ruefully
maybe
i
better
send
an
bulletin
you
the
boss
she
said
easily
but
if
i
know
scientists
they
do
read
bulletins
yeah
sure
he
agreed
you
made
sure
this
is
everybody
nobody
is
slighted
they
scream
like
stuck
pigs
when
i
ask
them
but
they
be
even
worse
if
i
slight
anybody
by
not
asking
double
checked
with
personnel
own
she
replied
the
machine
says
if
anybody
is
left
out
it
not
its
fault
that
it
would
only
be
because
we
stupid
humans
forgot
to
inform
it
in
the
first
place
sometimes
i
think
that
machine
complains
more
than
people
do
he
answered
certainly
it
is
a
lot
more
insolent
gets
more
work
done
though
she
said
comfortably
you
want
anything
more
not
right
now
buzz
if
you
do
the
idgit
is
working
out
the
supply
list
for
that
new
exploration
ship
and
it
wants
service
too
she
reminded
him
worse
than
you
are
she
added
he
looked
up
at
her
familiarity
with
a
twinkle
it
ca
fire
you
he
said
softly
oh
she
asked
you
think
not
just
let
me
feed
it
a
few
wrong
data
and
watch
what
happens
to
your
ol
lovin
secretary
she
winked
at
him
laughed
and
went
back
to
her
office
sector
chief
hayes
sighed
and
pulled
the
stack
of
cards
toward
him
first
he
must
sort
them
out
according
to
protocol
because
his
diplomacy
would
be
worth
the
breath
used
in
it
if
he
called
the
wrong
man
first
at
a
glance
he
saw
that
the
idgit
had
already
sorted
them
correctly
according
to
status
if
you
so
smart
he
muttered
to
the
absent
machine
why
did
you
call
them
too
he
picked
up
the
first
card
and
dialed
the
man
intercom
number
it
would
be
like
opening
the
lid
of
pandora
box
at
that
instant
the
red
light
of
the
e
intercom
flashed
on
hayes
dropped
the
ordinary
key
back
into
its
slot
and
pushed
the
e
key
to
open
he
did
not
recognize
the
voice
that
came
through
how
soon
the
voice
asked
will
we
be
able
to
get
into
this
eden
matter
i
setting
it
up
now
he
said
quickly
by
tomorrow
morning
surely
that
is
if
we
have
solved
it
ourselves
something
minor
that
would
require
an
morning
will
be
fine
two
possibly
three
seniors
will
be
available
the
red
light
flashed
off
showing
the
connection
had
been
broken
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
suddenly
conscious
that
his
forehead
was
wet
with
sweat
that
his
shirt
was
sticking
to
his
body
not
conscious
that
he
was
grinning
joyfully
now
let
those
pesty
scientists
challenge
him
with
the
question
of
whether
any
e
would
be
listening
to
their
review
two
of
maybe
three
besides
of
course
all
the
juniors
the
apprentices
the
students
he
dialed
the
first
scientist
again
but
this
time
he
did
mind
it
being
pandora
box
it
was
a
terrible
thing
for
a
man
to
realize
he
could
never
be
an
the
scientists
had
to
take
it
out
on
somebody
he
understood
hello
mille
he
said
cordially
in
answer
to
a
gruff
grunt
this
is
bill
hayes
of
sector
administration
all
right
all
right
the
voice
answered
testily
what
is
it
now
in
the
early
dawn
out
at
the
hangar
away
from
the
main
e
buildings
and
the
endless
discussions
going
on
inside
them
thomas
lynwood
moved
methodically
through
his
preflight
inspection
speculative
thinking
was
none
of
his
concern
his
job
was
to
pilot
an
e
wherever
he
might
want
to
go
and
bring
him
back
again
if
possible
to
lynwood
reality
was
a
physical
thing
the
feel
of
controls
beneath
his
broad
square
hands
the
hum
of
machinery
responsive
to
his
will
he
liked
mathematics
not
for
its
own
sake
but
because
it
best
described
the
substance
of
things
the
weight
the
size
the
properties
of
things
how
they
behaved
he
was
too
intelligent
not
to
realize
mathematics
could
also
communicate
speculative
unrealities
but
he
was
content
to
wait
until
the
theorists
had
turned
such
equations
into
machines
controls
forces
before
he
got
excited
he
was
one
who
even
in
childhood
had
never
wanted
to
be
an
he
did
want
to
be
one
now
somebody
had
once
told
him
in
personnel
that
was
why
he
was
a
favorite
pilot
of
the
e
but
he
discounted
that
they
did
try
to
tell
him
how
to
run
his
ship
well
most
of
them
did
and
he
did
try
to
tell
them
how
to
solve
their
problems
the
men
around
the
hangar
had
another
version
of
why
the
e
liked
him
to
pilot
them
around
he
was
lucky
somehow
he
always
managed
to
come
back
and
bring
the
e
with
him
well
sure
he
did
want
to
get
stuck
somewhere
wind
up
in
a
gulio
gullet
gassed
by
an
atmosphere
that
turned
from
into
pure
methane
without
warning
or
reason
and
against
all
known
chemical
laws
or
whiffed
out
in
the
lash
of
a
dead
star
suddenly
gone
nova
but
sometimes
a
pilot
could
help
himself
these
e
would
fiddle
around
in
places
where
human
beings
should
have
gone
most
of
the
time
they
were
allowed
even
one
mistake
he
was
lucky
sure
but
part
of
it
might
be
because
he
never
been
sent
out
with
the
wrong
there
could
be
a
first
time
luck
ran
out
if
you
kept
piling
your
bets
higher
and
higher
but
until
then
he
was
a
freckled
man
with
red
hair
contrary
to
superstition
he
did
have
a
fiery
temper
he
was
forty
and
had
already
built
up
a
seniority
of
twenty
years
in
deep
space
he
was
captain
of
his
ship
and
wanted
nothing
more
sure
it
was
only
a
crew
himself
a
flight
engineer
an
astronavigator
but
it
was
an
e
ship
which
meant
that
he
outranked
even
the
captains
of
the
great
luxury
liners
there
was
a
time
when
the
realization
caused
him
to
strut
a
little
but
he
got
over
it
he
was
single
had
no
ties
wanted
none
he
had
a
good
job
which
he
took
seriously
was
doing
significant
work
which
he
also
took
seriously
was
paid
premium
wages
even
for
a
space
captain
which
did
matter
except
in
terms
of
recognition
he
did
mind
going
anywhere
in
the
known
universe
or
how
long
he
would
be
away
he
hoped
he
would
get
back
someday
but
he
was
fanatic
about
it
in
a
routine
so
that
it
had
become
ritual
he
checked
over
the
cruiser
point
by
point
of
course
the
maintenance
men
had
checked
each
item
when
they
had
after
his
last
trip
dismantled
cleaned
oiled
polished
tested
and
reassembled
one
part
after
another
then
maintenance
supervisors
had
checked
over
the
ship
with
a
attitude
of
hoping
to
find
some
flaw
just
one
tiny
flub
so
they
could
turn
some
luckless
mechanic
inside
out
the
inspection
department
traditionally
an
enemy
of
maintenance
took
over
from
there
and
inspected
every
part
as
if
it
had
been
slapped
together
by
a
bunch
of
army
who
knew
that
pilots
were
expendable
in
peace
or
war
and
unconsciously
at
least
aided
in
expending
them
both
departments
had
certified
with
formal
preflight
papers
that
the
ship
was
in
readiness
for
deep
space
but
lynwood
considered
such
papers
as
so
much
garbage
and
went
over
the
entire
ship
himself
this
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
luck
he
wondered
if
frank
and
louie
had
checked
into
the
ship
this
morning
probably
had
last
night
outing
was
much
to
hang
over
about
a
steak
at
the
eagle
cafe
down
in
yellow
sands
a
couple
of
drinks
at
smitty
a
game
of
pool
at
smiley
a
few
dances
at
the
stars
and
moons
big
night
out
for
his
crew
before
they
left
for
deep
space
yellow
sands
was
strictly
for
young
families
where
hubby
worked
up
on
the
hill
at
and
wifey
raised
kids
who
already
considered
dad
to
be
behind
the
times
their
idea
of
sin
in
that
town
was
to
snub
the
wrong
matron
at
a
cocktail
party
or
not
snub
as
the
case
might
be
not
that
it
mattered
much
neither
frank
nor
louie
was
dedicated
to
when
he
at
last
opened
the
door
to
the
generator
room
he
saw
his
flight
engineer
frank
norton
had
a
couple
of
student
e
on
his
hands
it
was
one
of
the
nuisances
of
being
stationed
here
at
that
have
swarms
of
these
youngsters
hanging
around
asking
questions
disputing
your
answers
arguing
with
each
other
and
if
you
did
watch
them
carefully
taking
things
apart
and
putting
them
back
together
in
different
hookups
to
see
what
would
happen
the
first
thing
these
kids
were
taught
was
to
disregard
everything
everybody
had
ever
said
to
start
out
from
scratch
as
if
nobody
had
ever
had
the
sense
to
think
about
the
problem
before
to
doubt
most
of
all
the
opinions
of
experts
for
obviously
if
the
experts
were
right
then
there
would
be
no
problem
most
of
them
did
have
to
be
taught
it
they
seemed
to
have
been
born
with
it
time
was
you
batted
a
young
smart
aleck
down
told
him
to
go
get
dry
behind
the
ears
before
he
shot
off
his
mouth
but
not
these
days
these
days
you
looked
at
him
hopefully
and
crossed
your
fingers
he
might
grow
up
to
be
an
tom
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
doubt
the
realities
the
very
machinery
under
his
hands
to
assume
that
although
it
had
always
worked
it
might
not
work
this
time
he
could
not
conceive
that
state
of
mind
or
how
a
man
could
live
in
it
without
going
insane
every
time
he
saw
these
tortured
kids
saying
well
maybe
but
what
if
he
was
glad
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
ship
captain
who
knew
his
machinery
was
exactly
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
and
nothing
else
but
in
a
way
it
was
nice
for
the
lads
too
after
thousands
of
years
of
man
almost
rabid
determination
to
destroy
the
brightest
and
best
of
his
young
the
world
had
finally
found
a
place
for
the
bright
boy
this
morning
probably
because
of
the
early
dawn
hour
there
were
only
two
of
them
in
the
generator
room
as
expected
they
were
arguing
over
the
band
frank
was
standing
over
to
one
side
observing
but
not
participating
his
cap
was
pushed
back
on
his
blond
head
his
big
face
expressionless
it
was
common
gossip
throughout
flight
crews
everywhere
that
frank
blindfolded
could
take
a
cruiser
apart
and
put
it
back
together
without
missing
a
motion
the
jump
band
is
founded
on
the
basic
of
the
moebius
strip
one
student
e
was
saying
heatedly
this
little
gadget
sends
out
a
field
in
the
shape
of
such
a
strip
a
band
with
a
half
twist
before
rejoined
its
width
is
as
variable
as
we
need
it
up
to
a
only
it
has
any
width
at
all
the
other
student
argued
that
the
whole
point
the
moebius
strip
has
only
one
edge
so
it
ca
have
width
we
enter
that
edge
go
through
a
line
that
does
exist
and
come
out
a
away
without
taking
any
longer
than
the
time
to
pass
a
point
but
that
happens
not
the
other
shouted
angrily
everybody
knows
happens
tell
me
and
maybe
i
listen
tom
caught
his
flight
engineer
eye
and
signaled
with
his
head
that
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
get
rid
of
the
students
any
other
time
it
would
be
all
right
a
part
of
their
job
but
they
got
word
last
night
to
have
the
ship
in
readiness
from
six
on
they
might
have
to
wait
all
day
but
then
again
some
e
might
get
an
idea
and
want
to
go
shooting
out
to
eden
right
off
frank
caught
the
signal
grinned
and
began
to
herd
the
two
students
toward
the
door
they
were
in
such
heated
argument
now
accusing
one
another
of
parrot
repetition
instead
of
thinking
for
himself
that
they
did
realize
that
they
were
being
nudged
out
of
the
ship
down
its
ramp
and
out
on
the
field
do
think
it
has
been
educational
and
all
frank
murmured
to
them
as
he
got
them
off
the
ramp
you
get
the
how
of
it
figured
out
you
let
me
know
the
two
looked
at
him
as
if
he
might
be
an
interesting
phenomenon
decided
he
was
and
wandered
away
back
toward
the
school
dormitories
still
arguing
sometimes
i
think
a
quiet
milk
run
out
to
saturn
would
have
its
brighter
side
frank
muttered
to
tom
when
he
came
back
inside
the
ship
tom
grinned
at
him
in
wordless
understanding
there
was
no
tension
between
them
they
had
worked
together
so
long
that
they
had
got
over
all
the
conflicts
which
operate
far
beneath
the
surface
mind
to
cause
likes
and
dislikes
now
they
accepted
one
another
in
the
way
a
man
accepts
his
own
hands
proud
of
them
when
they
do
something
with
extra
skill
making
allowances
when
they
fumble
but
never
considering
doing
without
them
wonder
who
the
e
will
be
this
time
frank
asked
without
too
much
concern
it
did
really
matter
an
e
was
an
e
for
better
or
for
worse
have
heard
tom
answered
probably
not
decided
yet
if
the
senior
e
think
it
is
much
of
a
problem
they
might
send
a
junior
or
if
they
do
want
to
be
bothered
they
might
send
a
junior
who
up
for
his
solo
problem
whoever
or
whatever
i
sure
it
will
be
interesting
frank
commented
with
a
grin
tom
returned
the
grin
there
was
any
malice
in
it
nor
any
of
the
basic
enmity
and
destructiveness
of
the
stupid
toward
the
bright
just
a
recognition
that
an
e
was
an
they
had
a
vast
respect
for
an
e
but
you
could
get
around
it
that
some
of
them
were
well
maybe
eccentric
was
the
word
i
hear
there
trouble
on
that
planet
we
going
to
eden
is
it
frank
commented
you
think
we
be
hauling
an
e
out
there
if
there
were
tom
countered
wryly
they
continued
to
check
over
each
item
in
the
generator
room
their
flying
fingers
making
sharp
contrast
to
their
slow
idle
conversation
they
gave
the
room
extra
care
this
time
because
there
had
been
some
students
around
who
just
might
have
got
it
into
their
heads
to
improve
the
machinery
satisfied
at
last
that
there
had
been
no
subtle
meddling
they
snapped
the
cowl
of
the
generator
back
into
position
they
took
one
more
sharp
look
around
then
walked
single
file
up
the
narrow
passage
to
the
control
room
louie
lebeau
was
sitting
in
the
astronavigator
seat
checking
over
his
star
charts
and
instruments
he
glanced
up
at
them
as
they
came
level
with
his
cubicle
he
was
the
third
man
of
the
team
as
used
to
them
as
they
were
to
him
fourteen
hop
adjustments
to
get
us
past
pluto
and
out
of
the
heavy
traffic
he
grumbled
sourly
his
round
face
and
liquid
brown
eyes
were
perpetually
disgusted
they
keep
saying
over
at
traffic
that
going
to
provide
a
freeway
out
of
the
solar
system
so
we
can
take
it
in
one
hop
but
they
do
do
it
wonder
when
we
ever
go
modern
start
doing
things
scientific
they
paid
no
attention
to
his
grumbling
that
was
just
louie
then
how
many
hops
to
eden
after
pluto
tom
asked
i
figure
twenty
louie
answered
ca
take
full
leaps
every
time
there
stuff
in
the
way
there
always
stuff
in
the
way
to
louse
up
a
good
flight
plan
universe
is
too
crowded
there

no
trouble
getting
eden
no
trouble
there
make
it
in
about
fourteen
hours
fourteen
hours
to
go
eleven
lousy
little
fourteen
hours
i
got
to
work
in
one
stretch
wait
the
union
agent
hears
you
working
me
fourteen
hours
without
a
relief
and
are
you
letting
me
get
my
rest
now
so
i
can
work
fourteen
hours
or
are
you
stopping
me
from
resting
with
a
lot
of
questions
but
you
think
there
may
be
trouble
we
get
to
eden
tom
asked
louie
looked
at
him
there
was
no
fear
in
the
soft
brown
eyes
just
an
enormous
indignation
that
life
should
always
treat
him
so
dirty
do
you
he
asked
calvin
gray
junior
extrapolator
stood
nude
before
his
bathroom
mirror
and
played
a
light
over
his
chin
and
thin
cheeks
that
should
take
care
of
the
beard
problem
for
the
next
six
months
or
so
he
leaned
forward
and
examined
the
fine
lines
beginning
to
appear
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
well
that
was
one
of
the
signs
he
reached
the
thirty
mark
one
could
stay
forever
at
the
peak
of
youth
not
yet
anyway
perhaps
he
should
think
about
that
sometime
trouble
was
there
was
always
something
more
urgent
he
became
conscious
that
linda
was
standing
in
the
bathroom
door
watching
him
he
had
heard
her
get
out
of
bed
you
used
the
just
last
month
cal
she
said
there
was
a
questioning
note
in
her
voice
want
to
keep
handsome
he
said
lightly
never
know
when
i
might
have
to
run
out
to
some
other
world
would
want
one
of
my
other
wives
to
catch
me
with
stubble
on
my
face
it
was
a
stale
joke
a
childish
one
but
it
served
to
introduce
the
topic
foremost
in
his
mind
this
eden
problem
i
ca
plan
on
it
but
i
hope
it
my
solo
to
qualify
me
for
my
big
i
due
you
know
linda
chose
to
avoid
coming
directly
to
grips
with
it
yehudi
is
already
at
the
door
she
said
and
made
a
face
of
exasperation
someday
i
going
to
turn
off
the
gadget
that
signals
the
orderly
room
the
minute
you
get
out
of
bed
so
i
can
have
you
all
to
myself
it
better
if
you
get
used
to
him
cal
cautioned
turn
off
the
signal
and
that
turns
on
an
alarm
instead
of
one
yehudi
you
have
twenty
rushing
in
to
see
what
was
wrong
well
it
seems
to
me
a
grown
man
ought
to
be
able
to
take
his
morning
shower
without
an
observer
standing
by
to
see
that
he
does
drown
himself
or
swallow
the
soap
she
commented
with
a
touch
of
acid
get
used
to
it
woman
he
commanded
there
only
one
observer
now
when
if
i
get
my
senior
rating
there
be
three
she
did
say
anything
instead
she
stepped
over
to
him
pressed
her
nude
body
against
his
and
tenderly
nuzzled
his
arm
maybe
if
we
go
back
to
bed
he
go
away
she
said
and
glittered
her
eyes
at
him
wickedly
he
wo
but
it
a
good
idea
cal
grinned
at
her
you
could
tell
him
to
go
away
she
whispered
with
a
little
pout
she
was
fighting
she
was
fighting
with
the
only
weapon
she
had
to
hold
him
to
keep
him
from
going
away
to
face
an
unknown
he
knew
it
and
the
bitterness
in
her
eyes
back
of
her
teasing
showed
she
knew
he
knew
it
he
took
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
held
her
close
to
him
stroked
her
hair
kissed
her
mouth
she
pulled
her
face
away
buried
it
in
his
chest
he
felt
her
sobbing
he
picked
her
up
lightly
carried
her
back
into
the
bedroom
laid
her
gently
on
the
bed
and
oblivious
to
the
attendant
who
stood
expressionless
inside
the
door
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
and
held
her
head
in
his
arms
do
fight
it
he
said
softly
it
is
the
first
time
a
man
has
had
to
go
it
the
first
time
it
ever
happened
to
me
she
sobbed
you
knew
when
you
married
me
you
agreed
it
was
easy
to
agree
then
there
was
the
glamor
of
being
known
as
the
wife
of
an
now
that
does
matter
there
just
you
and
the
thought
of
losing
you
never
seeing
you
again
i
have
gone
yet
he
reminded
her
i
do
know
that
i
get
the
job
there
are
three
seniors
at
base
right
now
one
of
them
might
want
it
even
if
i
do
get
the
problem
who
says
i
wo
be
back
you
take
old
mcginnis
he
eighty
if
he
a
day
he
been
an
e
for
nigh
on
to
fifty
years
he
still
around
you
notice
she
was
quieter
now
she
lay
looking
at
him
drinking
in
his
dark
hair
blue
eyes
handsome
face
the
shape
of
his
intelligent
head
the
slope
of
his
neck
and
shoulders
the
tapering
waist
all
the
masculine
grace
and
beauty
she
pressed
her
closed
fist
into
her
mouth
all
the
beauty
she
might
never
see
again
feel
enfolded
around
her
enfold
with
herself
i
a
little
fool
she
said
through
clenched
teeth
of
course
be
back
and
you
better
make
it
quick
or
i
come
after
you
he
kissed
her
rumpled
her
short
hair
straightened
her
crumpled
body
on
the
bed
pulled
the
sheet
over
her
why
do
you
go
back
to
sleep
he
suggested
rest
i
have
breakfast
in
the
e
club
room
that
where
we
be
watching
the
eden
briefing
sleep
sleep
all
morning
gently
he
closed
her
eyes
with
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
gently
he
kissed
her
once
more
this
time
she
did
cling
to
him
try
to
hold
him
he
tucked
the
sheet
in
around
her
throat
dutifully
she
kept
her
eyes
closed
he
stood
up
then
and
signaled
the
orderly
i
take
my
shower
now
he
said
the
orderly
did
speak
just
followed
him
into
the
bathroom
to
stand
in
the
doorway
and
watch
him
through
the
shower
glass
he
was
rigidly
obeying
the
cardinal
rule
of
unless
his
life
is
in
danger
never
interrupt
the
thinking
of
an
the
whole
course
of
man
destiny
in
the
universe
may
depend
on
it
how
much
of
the
future
of
the
universe
depended
upon
his
not
interrupting
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
was
for
him
to
say
he
sighed
he
thought
of
his
own
wife
shrewish
fat
coarse
always
complaining
he
wondered
what
she
would
do
if
he
picked
her
up
carried
her
to
bed
closed
her
eyes
with
his
fingers
for
once
he
bet
be
speechless
he
must
try
it
sometime
but
first
she
have
to
lose
about
fifty
pounds
when
cal
got
to
the
e
club
room
two
seniors
were
already
there
mcginnis
and
wong
he
thought
their
greeting
was
a
shade
more
cordial
a
shade
more
interested
than
usual
they
seemed
this
time
to
be
looking
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
person
not
merely
a
junior
when
he
turned
away
from
them
to
greet
the
three
juniors
who
along
with
himself
ranked
the
privileges
he
became
certain
of
his
impressions
their
faces
were
frankly
envious
eden
was
to
be
his
problem
he
hoped
for
it
even
half
expected
it
yet
all
the
way
through
his
shower
dressing
coming
down
the
elevator
from
his
apartment
he
been
nagged
with
the
fear
he
might
not
be
considered
that
the
grief
of
linda
and
her
rise
above
it
would
lead
only
to
anticlimax
by
the
time
got
to
the
door
followed
by
his
orderly
he
had
already
conditioned
himself
to
disappointment
now
he
subdued
his
elation
while
he
told
his
orderly
what
he
wanted
for
breakfast
you
fellows
join
me
in
something
he
asked
both
juniors
and
seniors
a
second
cup
of
coffee
wong
agreed
a
second
bourbon
old
mcginnis
said
drily
the
juniors
shook
their
heads
negatively
yesterday
they
had
been
his
constant
companions
only
a
few
degrees
below
him
in
accomplishment
pushing
rapidly
to
become
his
equal
competitors
for
the
next
solo
today
this
morning
there
was
already
a
gap
between
them
and
him
a
chasm
they
would
make
no
move
to
bridge
until
they
had
earned
the
right
they
seated
themselves
at
another
table
apart
of
course
we
have
asked
you
if
you
want
this
eden
problem
mcginnis
commented
while
orderlies
placed
food
and
drink
in
front
of
them
we
ought
to
ask
him
had
we
wong
first
i
should
ask
if
either
of
you
want
it
cal
said
quickly
or
perhaps
malinkoff
if
he
shows
up
malinkoff
is
too
deep
in
something
to
come
to
the
briefing
wong
said
wong
and
i
came
only
to
help
on
your
first
solo
if
we
can
mcginnis
said
always
think
a
young
fellow
needs
a
little
i
remember
about
fifty
years
ago
more
or
less
worst
thing
to
guard
against
wong
interrupted
is
disappointment
this
whole
thing
might
add
up
to
nothing
might
not
turn
out
to
be
a
genuine
solo
at
all
just
something
any
errand
boy
could
do
in
that
case
it
would
qualify
you
you
know
that
sure
cal
said
naturally
the
problem
would
have
to
give
real
challenge
you
did
just
go
out
and
knock
a
home
run
to
become
an
you
tackled
something
outside
the
normal
frame
of
reference
something
that
required
original
thinking
the
e
kind
of
thinking
you
brought
it
off
successfully
a
given
number
of
seniors
reviewed
what
you
done
if
they
thought
it
was
worth
something
you
got
your
big
if
they
did
you
tried
again
and
you
did
get
it
by
default
just
because
somebody
thought
there
should
be
a
given
quota
of
seniors
on
the
list
little
or
big
he
added
i
like
the
problem
they
said
no
more
he
knew
the
score
he
had
twelve
years
of
the
most
intensive
training
the
e
themselves
could
devise
he
knew
that
sometimes
a
junior
spent
another
ten
or
twelve
years
chasing
down
jobs
which
anybody
on
the
spot
could
have
solved
if
they
used
their
heads
a
little
before
they
ran
on
to
something
that
challenged
that
training
he
be
lucky
if
this
was
big
enough
but
not
too
big
that
was
in
their
minds
too
on
ordinary
days
there
were
only
the
usual
few
science
reporters
in
the
press
room
of
these
held
their
jobs
by
the
difficult
compromise
between
the
scientists
insistence
upon
accuracy
and
their
equal
insistence
upon
sensationalism
since
the
publisher
paid
the
salary
since
rewrite
men
like
television
writers
maintained
their
own
feeling
of
superiority
to
the
mass
by
writing
down
to
the
level
of
a
not
very
bright
since
the
facts
had
to
be
trimmed
and
altered
to
fit
the
open
space
or
time
slot
even
these
reporters
had
a
difficult
time
of
maintaining
the
usual
odds
that
there
is
only
a
chance
that
anything
said
in
the
newspapers
or
on
the
air
may
be
accurate
but
on
this
morning
the
press
room
was
crowded
in
spite
of
all
efforts
of
journalism
to
stir
up
old
animosities
to
make
news
or
to
force
factional
leaders
into
rashness
which
could
not
be
settled
without
violence
the
various
states
of
world
government
insisted
upon
negotiating
ethnical
differences
amicably
and
factional
leaders
persisted
in
keeping
their
heads
there
had
been
no
discoveries
made
in
the
last
week
or
so
the
public
no
longer
believed
that
changing
a
screw
thread
was
exactly
a
scientific
no
real
or
imagined
scandals
seemed
of
such
journalistic
stature
as
to
work
the
public
into
a
frenzy
of
intolerance
for
one
aberrations
in
such
a
dry
spell
when
advertisers
were
beginning
to
question
circulation
figures
and
editors
were
racking
their
brains
for
a
strong
hate
symbol
to
create
interest
the
delayed
report
from
eden
came
as
a
summer
shower
that
might
be
magnified
into
a
flood
eden
silent
quickly
became
colony
feared
lost
and
progressed
normally
to
colony
wiped
out
that
there
was
no
proof
of
loss
or
destruction
bothered
no
one
in
journalism
if
it
did
turn
out
this
way
they
have
been
on
top
of
the
news
and
if
it
did
well
who
remembers
yesterday
headlines
in
the
press
of
today
new
hate
and
panic
the
public
with
an
established
addiction
to
ever
increasing
daily
doses
of
sensationalism
and
deprived
of
its
shots
through
this
dry
spell
snapped
out
of
its
apathy
to
greet
this
new
thrill
with
vociferous
calls
to
editors
wires
to
congressmen
telegrams
to
the
administration
what
are
we
doing
about
this
colony
that
has
been
wiped
out
where
is
our
space
battle
fleet
who
is
going
to
be
punished
it
was
an
overnight
sensation
and
on
this
morning
following
the
news
leak
there
could
even
be
seen
some
secretaries
to
the
writers
for
top
commentators
and
columnists
in
the
crowded
press
room
naturally
these
stood
in
little
groups
apart
and
associated
only
with
each
other
to
maintain
the
literary
tradition
of
proper
insulation
from
the
realities
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
rest
of
the
world
obviously
no
writer
could
have
afforded
to
appear
in
person
not
only
because
of
damage
to
his
stature
lest
it
be
noted
he
was
doing
his
own
spadework
but
more
important
observation
might
limit
his
capacity
for
rationalizing
the
situation
into
the
mold
demanded
by
the
bias
of
his
commentator
or
columnist
it
was
always
difficult
to
maintain
author
integrity
when
the
facts
did
not
support
the
sensationalism
required
by
the
employers
and
best
not
to
put
oneself
in
such
a
position
now
two
of
these
secretaries
could
be
seen
over
in
a
corner
of
the
press
room
exchanging
their
views
probing
one
another
for
information
no
one
thought
it
curious
they
were
trying
to
get
the
information
from
source
for
everyone
in
journalism
understands
the
importance
lies
in
what
the
competition
is
going
to
say
not
in
what
happened
how
long
has
it
been
since
the
first
message
came
through
or
did
fourteen
hours
about
we
could
have
had
a
rescue
fleet
out
there
by
now
to
rescue
from
what
whatever
wrong
i
understand
an
assistant
attorney
general
is
checking
into
it
so
gunderson
still
gunning
for
the
e
eh
has
he
ever
let
up
since
he
became
attorney
general
gripes
his
soul
he
ca
arrest
them
for
not
doing
what
he
wants
or
for
doing
what
he
does
want
how
they
ever
get
immune
anyhow
skip
class
that
day
in
history
must
vague
myself
right
after
the
insurrection
seems
there
were
two
powers
russia
and
america
the
people
of
the
world
got
fed
up
gave
a
pox
to
both
their
houses
boiled
over
formed
a
world
government
somehow
the
scientists
got
in
their
licks
in
the
turmoil
pointed
out
that
scientists
who
have
to
confine
their
discoveries
to
what
suits
the
ideology
of
the
can
only
find
limited
solutions
quite
a
deal
could
only
happen
in
a
world
turmoil
when
everything
was
fluid
anyhow
they
got
away
with
it
for
a
certain
group
extrapolators
had
to
be
free
to
extrapolate
without
fear
of
reprisal
boy
something
imagine
take
any
dame
you
want
nobody
can
squawk
take
any
money
riches
you
want
nobody
can
stop
it
funny
thing
nothing
like
that
happens
idea
seems
to
be
that
when
you
do
have
to
fight
against
restrictions
they
are
important
any
more
at
least
not
to
an
guess
that
why
one
of
pointed
out
that
police
are
the
major
cause
of
crime
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
that
what
sent
gunderson
into
a
tail
spin
i
would
be
surprised
but
what
he
a
little
hipped
on
that
subject
he
get
one
of
these
days
even
an
e
can
make
a
mistake
and
when
one
of
does
he
be
there
i
dunno
the
public
has
a
lot
of
for
the
pretty
tough
for
any
politician
to
buck
that
the
public
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
they
think
what
we
tell
to
think
you
and
me
you
think
that
why
he
got
a
man
out
here
on
this
eden
thing
looking
for
a
mistake
maybe
maybe
not
he
just
never
passes
up
the
chance
that
maybe
this
time
he
can
grab
something
between
gunderson
and
the
e
i
take
the
e
your
boss
feel
the
same
way
far
as
i
know
but
if
your
boss
changed
his
mind
you
would
have
an
agonizing
reappraisal
well
sure
a
guy
got
to
eat
the
west
wall
of
the
e
club
room
began
to
glow
lose
its
appearance
of
solidity
cal
signaled
his
orderly
to
lift
away
his
table
now
where
the
west
wall
had
been
another
room
seemed
to
join
this
one
an
office
a
large
man
in
a
brown
suit
made
an
entrance
through
the
door
of
the
office
and
sat
down
back
of
the
desk
his
face
was
drawn
with
weariness
i
am
bill
hayes
he
said
sector
administration
chief
of
the
eden
area
i
am
acting
moderator
of
this
review
we
follow
the
usual
rules
of
procedure
i
just
want
to
say
as
an
aside
that
the
scientists
involved
in
this
problem
have
been
up
all
night
reviewing
every
known
fact
about
eden
we
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
e
not
only
for
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
may
prove
too
little
but
for
any
strain
caused
by
trying
to
assemble
such
massive
data
into
order
in
so
short
a
time
for
the
press
let
me
say
we
are
aware
of
some
questions
of
why
we
did
immediately
send
out
a
fleet
of
ships
as
soon
as
the
call
failed
to
come
through
a
military
man
does
not
rush
troops
into
battle
until
he
has
some
idea
of
what
he
must
oppose
even
a
plumber
needs
to
get
some
idea
of
the
problem
before
he
knows
what
tools
to
take
with
him
it
would
serve
no
constructive
purpose
to
rush
an
unprepared
fleet
out
to
rescue
and
might
prove
the
highest
folly
all
over
in
the
various
buildings
where
anybody
was
directly
concerned
the
same
effect
would
be
taking
place
as
appeared
here
in
the
club
room
the
screen
wall
would
seem
to
join
the
room
of
the
person
speaking
a
pressed
button
signaled
the
desire
to
speak
and
like
the
chairman
of
a
meeting
bill
hayes
decided
whom
to
recognize
it
was
a
way
to
conduct
a
meeting
of
two
or
three
thousand
people
as
intimately
as
a
small
conference
the
e
have
signaled
they
are
ready
for
the
eden
briefing
hayes
continued
formally
he
faded
out
his
own
office
and
was
immediately
replaced
by
an
astrophysics
laboratory
the
review
of
eden
was
under
way
with
sky
charts
pointers
math
formulae
and
many
references
to
documentation
the
astrophysicist
established
the
celestial
position
of
ceti
relative
to
earth
and
its
second
planet
ceti
ii
popularly
called
he
had
heard
eden
for
his
part
bitterly
he
preferred
a
little
less
popularizing
of
scientific
data
a
little
more
exactitude
he
would
therefore
continue
to
call
it
ceti
ii
he
reminded
cal
of
certain
teachers
in
schools
he
had
been
asked
to
leave
back
in
his
ugly
duckling
days
how
didactically
positively
they
clung
to
their
exactitudes
like
frightened
little
children
in
a
chaotic
world
too
big
for
them
to
face
hanging
on
to
mother
skirts
something
safe
sure
dependable
the
astrophysicist
continued
at
considerable
length
to
establish
the
position
of
ceti
ii
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
in
his
own
mind
cal
willingly
conceded
that
at
least
in
terms
of
continuum
eden
could
be
found
where
the
man
said
it
was
then
he
reminded
himself
sternly
that
the
essence
might
be
that
eden
was
there
no
longer
that
he
better
pay
closest
attention
to
everything
said
however
positive
and
didactic
lest
he
find
his
own
mind
closed
to
a
solution
he
reminded
himself
that
after
all
these
people
had
worked
all
night
for
his
benefit
while
he
lay
peacefully
in
linda
arms
he
reminded
himself
that
one
little
bit
of
datum
one
little
phrase
carelessly
heard
now
might
mean
his
success
or
failure
didactic
pedantry
has
its
place
in
science
and
these
were
scientists
not
vaudeville
performers
silently
he
apologized
to
the
lot
of
them
a
geophysicist
took
over
the
review
he
quickly
got
down
out
of
space
to
the
surface
of
eden
personally
he
did
mind
calling
it
eden
just
so
all
the
purists
knew
he
was
referring
to
ceti
ii
this
was
supposed
to
be
humorous
and
he
waited
until
all
the
viewers
had
had
a
chance
to
chuckle
with
him
if
the
astrophysicist
signaled
his
demand
for
a
retraction
and
apology
for
this
public
ridicule
bill
hayes
apparently
did
feel
it
worth
breaking
up
the
review
to
oblige
him
after
he
had
enjoyed
his
own
humor
the
geophysicist
did
present
his
capsule
of
knowledge
with
excellent
brevity
there
were
no
large
continents
instead
there
were
thousands
of
islands
so
many
that
the
land
mass
roughly
equaled
the
sea
surface
the
islands
had
not
been
counted
he
admitted
and
then
needlessly
explained
that
eden
had
been
discovered
only
ten
years
ago
since
universe
exploration
was
expanding
much
faster
than
properly
qualified
scientists
could
follow
to
catalogue
conditions
details
such
as
this
had
been
left
for
future
colonists
to
complete
he
took
time
out
to
complain
that
the
younger
generation
was
too
dazzled
by
glamor
and
wanted
to
become
entertainment
stars
sports
stars
jet
jockeys
exploring
space
and
there
were
enough
going
into
the
solid
sciences
to
keep
up
with
the
work
to
be
done
a
biophysicist
interposed
here
and
stated
that
his
research
with
the
injection
of
uric
acid
into
rats
caused
a
marked
rise
in
intelligence
and
if
the
administration
would
just
pay
attention
and
let
him
have
the
grant
he
was
asking
he
felt
confident
that
research
in
how
to
change
the
human
kidney
structure
would
take
us
a
long
mutant
leap
ahead
toward
humans
with
bill
hayes
cut
him
off
as
tactfully
as
possible
and
suggested
that
the
eden
problem
was
here
and
now
and
perhaps
we
should
get
that
one
out
of
the
way
first
both
scientists
by
their
expressions
indicated
that
they
did
not
appreciate
being
frustrated
hampered
driven
but
they
did
comply
back
to
eden
they
went
the
climate
was
something
like
that
of
the
hawaiian
area
partly
this
was
due
to
the
variable
plane
rotation
that
heated
all
parts
evenly
partly
due
to
favorable
flow
of
ocean
currents
it
had
been
noted
that
there
was
such
an
interweaving
of
cool
and
warm
currents
all
over
the
globe
that
a
relatively
even
temperature
was
maintained
throughout
some
differential
in
spots
of
course
enough
to
cause
rainfall
but
no
real
violence
of
storms
not
as
we
classified
hurricanes
typhoons
tornadoes
here
on
earth
probably
no
sudden
storm
to
wipe
out
the
colony
before
they
could
send
news
then
wong
suggested
in
an
aside
to
cal
or
a
freak
one
did
occur
and
they
were
prepared
because
it
supposed
to
happen
cal
said
wong
and
mcginnis
exchanged
a
quick
glance
and
cal
knew
wong
had
laid
a
little
trap
to
see
how
easily
he
might
be
lulled
into
a
premature
conclusion
the
gravity
was
slightly
less
the
geophysicist
was
saying
but
only
to
the
extent
that
man
newly
arrived
from
earth
walked
with
a
springier
step
did
tire
as
quickly
not
enough
to
cause
nausea
even
to
the
inexperienced
the
oxygen
content
of
the
air
in
fact
the
whole
of
the
air
was
so
close
to
earth
quality
there
were
no
breathing
adaptations
necessary
so
much
for
generalities
he
went
on
to
document
them
with
exactitudes
he
teamed
up
with
a
meteorologist
to
explain
the
distribution
of
rainfall
in
spite
of
lack
of
frigid
and
torrid
air
masses
cal
doubt
was
not
appeased
weather
prediction
was
about
on
a
par
with
handicapping
and
easy
to
explain
after
it
happened
eventually
the
geophysicist
and
the
meteorologist
completed
their
duet
to
the
accompaniment
of
oceanographers
and
geologists
a
chorus
of
botanists
replaced
them
on
the
screen
the
major
theme
of
their
epic
being
that
an
astonishing
proportion
of
the
plant
forms
bore
edible
fruit
nuts
seeds
leaves
stems
roots
flowers
a
choir
of
zoologists
joined
their
voices
here
to
point
out
the
large
number
of
small
meat
animals
fish
and
crustaceans
with
the
whole
thing
sounding
like
a
pean
of
thanksgiving
after
two
hours
the
condensed
information
added
up
to
a
most
interesting
fact
in
essence
due
to
quite
conditions
odd
how
much
the
scientists
seemed
to
need
stressing
the
word
natural
eden
was
more
favorable
to
easy
human
life
than
earth
cal
leaned
forward
here
was
the
spot
where
some
student
or
apprentice
might
distinguish
himself
by
asking
an
embarrassing
question
or
so
say
the
range
of
easily
possible
conditions
on
any
given
planet
was
a
scale
ten
miles
in
length
then
that
area
on
the
scale
where
man
could
exist
without
artificial
aids
would
still
be
less
than
a
hair
breadth
and
now
to
find
a
planet
more
nearly
perfect
for
man
than
the
one
on
which
he
evolved
or
were
the
students
considering
this
too
obvious
to
mention
he
decided
to
nudge
them
a
little
sometimes
a
discussion
of
the
too
obvious
brought
out
things
not
obvious
at
all
how
frequently
he
asked
when
hayes
had
cut
him
in
do
we
find
a
mass
revolving
in
such
a
manner
that
its
poles
revolve
at
right
angles
to
its
forward
revolution
so
there
is
no
real
pole
it
requires
roundness
and
an
even
distribution
of
land
and
water
masses
such
as
we
have
on
ceti
ii
the
first
astrophysicist
answered
how
frequently
do
we
find
that
cal
repeated
i
know
of
no
other
the
astrophysicist
replied
shortly
any
evidence
of
tampering
with
those
ocean
currents
to
get
them
flowing
so
beneficially
cal
asked
none
yet
discovered
an
oceanographer
cut
in
well
at
least
he
had
stated
with
positiveness
that
there
had
been
and
could
be
but
an
anthropaleontologist
inserted
himself
and
spoiled
the
effect
of
there
is
definitely
no
life
form
on
eden
with
sufficient
intelligence
for
that
the
man
said
nor
has
there
ever
been
such
a
feat
would
require
enormous
engineering
works
such
works
under
the
ocean
would
be
matched
by
comparable
works
on
land
and
would
therefore
show
up
in
our
aerial
surveys
however
ancient
and
overgrown
cal
sighed
softly
to
himself
the
human
kind
of
civilization
yes
that
would
have
left
traces
but
what
of
some
other
kind
perhaps
a
kind
that
had
never
come
out
upon
the
land
never
mind
the
arguments
that
such
a
civilization
could
not
have
developed
that
was
looking
at
it
from
the
human
point
of
view
again
had
man
grown
so
accustomed
to
not
finding
comparable
intelligence
anywhere
in
the
universe
he
had
begun
to
discount
or
forget
there
could
be
the
review
went
on
and
on
the
zoologist
sketched
in
the
prevalent
animals
and
fish
forms
showed
there
was
nothing
in
land
animals
higher
than
a
large
rodent
no
sea
mammals
at
all
no
fish
larger
than
the
tarpon
nothing
at
all
to
hint
at
a
line
of
primates
a
bacteriologist
exclaimed
at
length
over
the
similarity
of
minute
life
forms
to
those
on
earth
and
used
the
occasion
to
again
expound
the
old
theory
of
life
spores
to

all
favorable

and
thus
develop
similar
forms
through
evolution
wherever
found
quickly
and
tactfully
bill
hayes
nudged
him
back
on
the
track
before
the
expected
storm
of
controversy
could
break
out
then
there
was
a
short
lunch
time
but
not
a
leisurely
one
quite
aside
from
the
emergency
of
what
might
be
happening
to
the
colonists
there
was
growing
clamor
from
the
people
and
pressure
from
various
governmental
bodies
to
get
off
the
dime
and
get
going
rescue
those
people
or
cynically
at
least
make
a
show
of
action
to
quell
the
flood
of
telegrams
resisted
the
pressures
in
favor
of
doing
a
workmanlike
job
in
preparation
for
a
genuine
rescue
instead
of
a
haphazard
show
but
was
mindful
of
them
nevertheless
anyone
who
has
witnessed
even
so
much
as
a
trial
can
not
help
but
realize
that
government
by
law
instead
of
man
is
a
mere
political
phrase
without
meaning
in
reality
the
ascendancy
of
over
runs
so
deep
in
the
human
psyche
that
abstract
idealisms
must
always
take
second
place
where
such
ascendancy
is
threatened
thus
we
see
that
the
meek
and
subservient
to
the
judge
comes
off
with
a
token
sentence
while
the
man
who
attempts
to
maintain
his
pride
his
rights
his
gets
the
book
thrown
at
him
no
practical
attorney
is
unaware
that
the
judgment
of
his
case
depends
largely
upon
who
presides
the
whims
the
prejudices
the
moods
the
viewpoint
of
the
judge
and
that
the
law
merely
provides
justification
for
the
imposition
of
those
whims
moods
prejudices
and
viewpoints
and
ambitions
the
announcement
at
that
a
junior
e
would
be
given
this
problem
gave
gunderson
man
the
opening
he
had
hoped
to
find
a
hurried
call
to
the
capitol
and
a
brief
conversation
with
gunderson
himself
confirmed
his
conclusions
perhaps
the
e
was
above
all
law
and
it
might
not
be
expedient
to
challenge
that
right
now
but
immunity
did
not
necessarily
extend
to
the
junior
in
view
of
the
known
ambitions
of
certain
judges
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
make
a
test
case
of
this
whether
the
e
had
a
right
to
jeopardize
a
colony
of
human
beings
by
assigning
an
unqualified
man
to
the
problem
a
question
too
of
who
had
jurisdiction
over
the
juniors
the
apprentices
the
students
how
far
down
the
line
did
the
mantle
of
the
e
extend
to
protect
those
not
yet
qualified
how
far
out
did
the
administration
of
extend
to
substitute
for
government
how
much
of
a
state
within
a
state
had
become
now
while
the
public
was
clamoring
for
action
and
was
instead
droning
on
through
a
mass
of
inconsequential
detail
now
while
public
sentiment
was
crystallizing
or
could
be
crystallized
into
placing
human
welfare
over
science
procedures
now
was
the
time
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
a
judge
who
was
predisposed
to
favor
the
request
of
the
attorney
general
after
lunch
at
the
colonizing
administrator
took
over
the
review
the
precolonizing
scientists
had
not
been
trapped
by
the
obviously
favorable
aspects
of
eden
into
neglecting
their
full
duties
no
indeed
they
had
given
the
full
routine
of
tests
and
had
come
up
with
exactly
nothing
that
might
be
unfavorable
to
man
at
least
not
more
so
than
on
earth
colonization
had
followed
the
usual
plan
fifty
professional
colonists
had
been
sent
out
to
eden
they
knew
their
jobs
they
were
temperamentally
suited
to
the
work
as
usual
they
were
to
live
there
for
five
years
leaning
as
lightly
as
possible
on
earth
supplement
their
prime
purpose
was
to
adapt
primitive
ecology
to
human
needs
how
it
could
be
done
it
was
not
the
job
of
this
first
colony
to
explore
to
catalogue
they
were
expected
to
do
only
what
any
pioneer
does
endure
exist
and
prove
it
possible
in
honesty
the
colonizing
administrator
had
to
point
out
there
had
been
more
than
the
usual
dissatisfaction
from
this
colony
the
burden
of
their
complaint
was
that
they
found
living
too
easy
they
were
professionals
accustomed
to
challenge
they
had
first
recommended
then
demanded
that
they
be
transferred
and
the
planet
given
over
to
the
colonists
they
complained
they
were
dying
on
the
vine
that
easy
living
was
making
farmers
and
storekeepers
out
of
them
that
they
were
getting
soft
ruined
by
disuse
of
their
talents
for
meeting
and
coping
with
hostile
conditions
there
had
even
been
threats
that
one
of
these
days
they
would
all
pile
into
their
ship
and
come
back
home
so
far
he
had
stopped
them
by
threats
of
his
own
that
he
would
personally
see
they
never
got
another
assignment
he
had
resisted
their
demands
five
years
was
a
short
enough
time
some
organisms
took
longer
than
that
to
develop
in
the
human
body
or
mind
to
make
their
inimical
presence
known
some
did
not
show
up
until
the
second
or
third
generation
which
was
the
reason
for
the
colonists
to
live
there
for
three
generations
before
the
planet
could
be
opened
to
young
john
smith
and
his
wife
mary
who
dreamed
of
owning
a
little
chicken
ranch
out
away
from
it
all
he
had
argued
that
boredom
might
be
just
the
very
inimical
condition
they
were
having
to
test
cal
felt
a
twinge
of
disappointment
here
perhaps
the
dissatisfied
colonists
had
merely
gone
on
strike
unable
to
get
satisfaction
from
their
administrator
they
chose
not
to
communicate
as
a
means
of
drawing
attention
getting
an
investigation
of
their
plight
drastic
perhaps
but
man
had
been
known
to
do
drastic
things
before
when
he
felt
treated
unfairly
this
seemed
such
a
likely
solution
that
for
a
moment
he
let
his
disappointment
override
his
interest
such
would
be
an
administrative
hassle
nothing
to
challenge
an
e
at
all
not
even
a
junior
still
it
might
not
be
the
solution
he
had
better
listen
to
the
whole
of
the
problem
the
colonists
had
chosen
a
large
island
for
their
first
settlement
in
the
center
was
a
small
mountain
it
had
been
given
the
name
of
crystal
palace
mountain
because
it
was
crested
with
an
outcropping
of
amethystine
structures
in
pillars
domes
arches
spires
like
spokes
of
a
wheel
radiating
out
from
the
hub
ridges
fell
away
from
this
mountain
and
in
between
the
ridges
there
lay
fertile
valleys
watered
by
perpetual
streams
it
was
in
one
of
these
valleys
about
halfway
between
the
mountain
and
the
sea
that
the
colonists
settled
some
bucolic
wit
had
named
the
first
settlement
appletree
because
there
they
would
gain
knowledge
and
everybody
knows
that
the
apple
was
the
garden
of
eden
fruit
of
knowledge
no
one
quite
knew
when
the
name
eden
was
first
applied
to
the
planet
suddenly
during
the
first
scientific
expedition
everyone
was
referring
to
it
that
way
for
exactitude
the
administrator
said
diplomatically
of
course
we
still
designate
it
as
ceti
ii
as
was
customary
the
colony
had
communicated
multitudes
of
progress
pictures
over
the
band
here
was
the
valley
before
they
had
started
to
fell
trees
here
it
was
in
progress
of
clearing
here
they
were
converting
the
trees
into
lumber
for
houses
here
were
the
first
houses
so
that
some
could
move
out
of
the
living
quarters
in
the
ship
here
they
were
uprooting
the
stumps
turning
the
sod
planting
earth
seed
these
were
barns
for
the
cattle
and
horses
sent
with
them
from
earth
a
collection
of
community
buildings
came
next
in
the
series
of
photographs
and
finally
there
was
the
whole
village
of
appletree
with
a
collection
of
small
farms
surrounding
it
the
pictures
showed
it
all
as
ideal
for
man
as
a
distant
view
of
a
rural
valley
in
ohio
productive
progressive
and
peaceful
from
a
distance
but
back
of
the
scene
human
psychology
progressed
normally
also
the
reporting
psychologist
was
most
emphatic
on
this
issue
his
department
would
have
been
most
alarmed
had
differences
and
schisms
developed
would
have
been
an
abnormality
calling
for
investigation
differences
in
outlook
became
apparent
in
spite
of
the
common
temperament
and
experience
of
the
group
little
personal
enmities
developed
and
grew
sympathizers
drew
together
in
little
groups
each
group
considering
its
stand
to
be
the
right
one
and
therefore
all
who
disagreed
wrong
the
psychologist
said
he
was
sure
all
viewing
would
remember
the
classical
picture
of
primitive
earth
man
at
first
awareness
he
stands
upon
a
hill
and
looks
about
him
there
comes
the
astonishing
realization
that
he
can
see
about
the
same
distance
in
all
directions
why
he
exclaims
to
himself
i
must
be
at
the
very
center
of
creation
his
awe
and
wonder
was
to
grow
wherever
he
went
he
found
he
was
still
at
the
center
of
things
there
could
be
only
one
conclusion
because
i
am
always
at
the
center
of
things
i
must
be
the
most
important
event
in
all
creation
still
later
comes
another
realization
those
who
are
with
me
and
are
therefore
a
part
of
are
also
at
the
center
of
things
and
share
my
importance
those
who
are
not
with
me
and
not
a
part
of
are
not
at
the
center
of
things
and
are
therefore
of
an
inferior
nature
it
could
readily
be
seen
the
psychologist
was
allowing
a
note
of
dryness
to
enter
his
comments
that
the
bulk
of
man
philosophy
religion
politics
social
values
and
yes
too
often
even
his
scientific
conclusions
was
based
upon
this
egocentric
notion
the
supreme
importance
and
rightness
of
ascendant
at
the
center
of
things
opposed
to
those
who
are
not
a
part
of
on
the
outside
and
therefore
inferior
there
must
have
been
a
signal
from
bill
hayes
for
the
psychologist
left
the
generalities
behind
and
came
back
to
the
issue
the
very
ease
of
living
on
eden
fostered
the
growth
of
schisms
for
there
was
no
common
enemy
to
band
the
group
into
one
solid
organism
the
audience
would
recall
that
when
earth
was
divided
into
nations
it
had
always
been
imperative
to
find
a
common
enemy
in
some
other
nation
that
this
was
the
only
cohesive
force
man
had
been
able
to
find
to
keep
the
nation
from
disintegrating
another
nudge
factions
took
shape
on
eden
and
clashed
in
town
meetings
at
last
as
expected
some
dissident
individuals
and
family
groups
could
no
longer
tolerate
the
irritation
of
living
in
the
same
neighborhood
with
the
rest
these
broke
off
from
the
main
colony
and
migrated
across
the
near
ridge
to
settle
in
an
adjacent
valley
psychologically
it
was
a
most
satisfactory
development
playing
out
in
classical
microcosm
the
massive
behavior
of
total
man
for
as
everyone
knew
had
men
ever
been
able
to
settle
their
differences
had
man
been
able
to
get
along
peacefully
with
himself
he
might
have
developed
no
civilization
at
all
man
inability
to
stand
the
stench
of
his
own
kind
was
the
most
potent
of
all
forces
in
driving
him
out
to
the
stars
bill
hayes
a
weary
and
moderator
now
apparently
decided
he
could
no
longer
stand
the
stench
of
the
psychologist
and
abruptly
cut
him
off
he
himself
took
over
the
summation
it
boiled
down
to
a
simple
statement
the
colonists
had
reported
everything
that
happened
of
significance
or
not
these
reports
had
all
been
thoroughly
sifted
in
the
normal
course
of
daily
work
as
they
were
received
they
had
been
collated
and
extended
both
by
human
and
machine
minds
to
detect
any
subtle
trends
away
from
norm
there
had
been
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
reports
might
as
well
have
originated
somewhere
near
eugene
oregon
they
were
about
as
unusual
as
a
saturday
night
bath
back
on
the
farm
then
silence
sudden
inexplicable
silence
it
bothers
me
it
bothers
me
a
lot
cal
said
to
the
two
e
following
the
review
that
eden
should
be
more
favorable
to
effortless
human
existence
than
earth
he
snapped
on
the
communicator
and
asked
the
ship
be
in
readiness
for
mcginnis
and
wong
looked
at
one
another
you
think
it
might
have
been
the
original
garden
of
eden
wong
asked
his
face
was
impassive
it
fits
you
know
man
was
banished
from
an
ideal
condition
and
forced
to
live
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
not
that
so
much
cal
said
not
unless
the
whole
concept
of
evolution
is
haywire
and
we
reasonably
sure
it
is
that
far
off
probably
the
colonists
have
gone
on
strike
but
i
still
keep
thinking
that
when
we
want
to
catch
rats
we
set
a
trap
with
a
better
food
than
they
can
get
normally
there
was
a
twinkle
in
mcginnis
eye
you
think
eden
is
an
alluring
trap
especially
baited
to
catch
human
beings
he
asked
i
do
exactly
think
that
i
just
keep
wondering
cal
answered
they
were
interrupted
by
a
diffident
yet
insistent
knock
on
the
door
this
in
itself
was
such
a
violation
of
rules
never
to
interrupt
the
thinking
of
an
e
that
all
three
stopped
talking
the
three
juniors
who
had
been
sitting
by
listening
arose
from
their
seats
and
stood
facing
the
door
the
orderlies
looked
to
the
e
for
instruction
at
a
nod
from
mcginnis
one
of
them
walked
over
to
the
door
and
opened
it
bill
hayes
was
standing
there
flushed
with
embarrassment
your
pardon
e
he
said
hurriedly
i
just
an
errand
boy
under
instruction
from
general
administration
we
have
been
served
with
a
court
injunction
to
prevent
assignment
of
a
junior
to
the
eden
matter
cal
froze
in
alarm
and
disappointment
at
the
last
moment
to
have
his
chance
snatched
away
from
him
he
should
have
gone
immediately
the
review
was
over
without
waiting
for
any
advice
mcginnis
and
wong
might
care
to
give
now
mcginnis
caught
his
eye
and
gave
a
slight
nod
toward
a
door
that
opened
on
another
hallway
he
flashed
a
command
with
his
eyes
to
get
going
then
turned
back
to
hayes
i
was
unaware
that
the
e
must
heed
court
orders
he
said
frostily
it
a
question
of
where
civil
jurisdiction
stops
and
e
jurisdiction
takes
over
hayes
explained
nervously
while
the
colonists
are
employed
by
and
under
their
direction
it
is
held
they
are
also
earth
citizens
with
citizen
rights
civil
authority
feels
it
must
answer
for
their
welfare
i
thought
restrictions
upon
the
e
were
removed
by
act
of
world
congress
some
seventy
years
ago
wong
said
mildly
the
injunction
makes
it
clear
there
is
no
restriction
upon
the
senior
e
just
the
junior
who
really
is
an
e
yet
it
is
the
decision
of
the
e
that
a
junior
will
handle
this
problem
mcginnis
said
and
turned
his
back
as
if
that
settled
the
matter
hayes
cleared
his
throat
nervously
i
sorry
he
said
if
it
were
up
to
me
well
the
argument
before
the
court
ran
this
way
that
where
there
is
no
restriction
upon
the
e
in
arriving
at
a
solution
there
is
also
no
compulsion
upon
civil
authority
to
adopt
that
solution
they
cited
instances
well
any
number
of
instances
it
seems
cal
heard
no
more
he
had
been
pacing
the
room
and
now
while
perspiring
attention
was
focused
imploringly
on
wong
and
mcginnis
he
slipped
out
the
door
the
orderly
at
that
door
raised
a
finger
in
salute
and
at
cal
request
quickly
wheeled
a
from
a
storage
closet
take
me
out
to
the
eden
ship
cal
said
quietly
you
know
where
it
is
yes
the
orderly
answered
he
took
his
place
at
the
controls
and
cal
slipped
into
the
seat
beside
him
they
sped
through
the
halls
at
maximum
speed
out
the
rear
exit
of
the
e
building
down
the
maze
of
ramps
and
out
across
the
landing
field
to
the
entrance
of
the
ship
cal
expected
to
see
guards
posted
there
to
enforce
the
injunction
but
none
were
in
evidence
as
they
drew
up
to
the
open
door
he
saw
lynwood
and
norton
pilot
and
engineer
standing
just
inside
waiting
for
him
there
was
no
strain
in
their
faces
to
show
they
had
received
orders
not
to
take
off
with
him
he
climbed
out
of
the
car
and
with
another
nod
the
orderly
drove
it
back
to
the
e
building
henceforward
the
ship
crew
would
be
the
orderlies
cal
climbed
the
short
ramp
and
entered
the
ship
you
have
clearance
to
take
off
at
once
he
asked
lynwood
lynwood
nodded
since
early
morning
he
answered
fine
let
get
going
cal
said
i
in
a
hurry
of
course
he
added
with
a
grin
of
course
the
two
men
answered
then
seeing
his
grin
relaxed
and
returned
it
apparently
this
e
was
human
it
took
only
a
minute
for
them
to
reach
the
control
room
where
louie
sat
in
his
navigator
cubby
and
only
ten
more
seconds
for
the
ship
to
lift
clear
and
still
no
command
came
over
the
radio
to
halt
them
someone
in
civil
authority
had
slipped
had
gunderson
really
felt
that
a
simple
injunction
would
stop
everything
that
the
e
would
not
challenge
this
encroachment
was
he
playing
some
deeper
game
allowing
the
junior
to
slip
through
his
fingers
in
the
hope
he
would
louse
up
the
eden
rescue
add
strength
to
the
campaign
to
bring
the
e
back
under
civil
control
his
control
or
had
someone
genuinely
slipped
the
command
to
halt
turn
around
and
return
to
base
did
not
come
until
their
second
hop
had
brought
them
into
the
mars
orbit
then
it
came
from
space
police
in
charge
of
shipping
traffic
at
that
point
i
am
under
orders
from
to
proceed
tom
answered
after
a
quick
questioning
look
at
cal
the
attorney
general
office
orders
you
to
halt
the
voice
commanded
tom
looked
at
cal
again
questioning
this
was
bucking
the
federal
government
his
license
would
be
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
if
he
ignored
the
order
to
say
nothing
of
any
other
punishment
they
might
choose
to
hand
him
keep
going
cal
answered
shortly
and
make
your
next
jump
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
am
under
orders
to
keep
going
tom
answered
the
police
if
he
refused
the
request
of
an
e
a
lifetime
of
work
would
go
down
the
drain
over
in
his
seat
frank
norton
fingers
were
speeding
through
the
intricate
pattern
of
setting
up
the
next
jump
he
and
louie
were
working
as
one
man
i
am
under
orders
to
disable
you
if
you
refuse
the
police
warned
we
have
an
e
on
board
tom
answered
you
be
risking
a
lot
i
am
advised
he
is
a
junior
e
the
voice
said
in
clipped
speech
not
such
a
risk
far
as
i
concerned
tom
answered
laconically
he
an
i
have
to
follow
his
orders
he
nodded
to
frank
who
touched
the
jump
switch
there
was
an
instant
silence
they
were
at
the
approach
to
the
asteroid
belt
they
can
get
us
here
louie
spoke
up
we
have
to
give
over
controls
so
they
can
take
us
through
no
chart
can
keep
up
to
the
microsecond
on
these
asteroid
movements
they
have
to
calculate
a
path
in
short
hops
and
take
us
through
a
step
at
a
time
i
keep
saying
there
ought
to
be
an
expressway
out
of
the
solar
system
but
what
about
a
good
long
jump
at
right
angles
cal
asked
get
over
it
instead
of
through
it
it
illegal
louie
complained
our
necks
are
already
out
tom
said
quietly
okay
you
the
boss
but
i
have
to
figure
it
it
takes
time
to
figure
it
well
get
going
on
it
there
stuff
all
over
louie
explained
not
just
a
band
like
most
people
think
the
asteroids
have
moved
at
right
angles
too
not
so
thick
but
there
a
globe
of
stuff
not
just
a
belt
maybe
a
bunch
of
little
jumps
we
ca
start
making
them
until
you
figure
them
louie
frank
reminded
him
the
radio
gave
its
hum
of
life
and
a
voice
came
through
we
have
orders
from
space
police
not
to
escort
you
through
to
turn
you
back
this
is
an
e
ship
with
an
e
on
board
his
command
is
to
come
through
tom
said
i
just
work
here
the
voice
answered
as
if
it
were
bored
and
tired
i
take
my
orders
from
space
control
tom
looked
over
at
louie
louie
apparently
caught
the
look
out
of
a
corner
of
his
eye
and
impatiently
waved
a
finger
not
to
bother
him
his
other
hand
was
speeding
through
the
movements
of
manipulating
the
astrocalculator
then
he
nodded
his
head
still
not
looking
up
and
the
flashed
in
front
of
frank
now
as
rapidly
as
louie
frank
set
up
the
pattern
of
the
jump
band
i
take
my
orders
from
the
e
tom
answered
in
a
voice
that
matched
the
boredom
tiredness
then
with
a
nod
from
frank
now
he
said
there
was
silence
again
it
going
to
add
at
least
an
hour
louie
complained
i
got
to
pick
my
way
through
this
muck
we
got
time
now
tom
answered
easily
not
likely
they
can
find
us
out
here
away
from
the
regular
lanes
not
unless
we
run
across
a
prowl
ship
louie
said
you
know
some
smuggling
and
now
and
then
a
shipping
company
thinks
it
can
beat
the
rap
not
pay
the
toll
by
doing
the
same
thing
we
doing
the
prowl
patrol
is
on
to
all
the
tricks
we
not
the
first
ones
to
try
it
just
keep
figuring
louie
tom
said
all
right
all
right
louie
quarreled
back
tom
looked
at
cal
and
grimaced
louie
all
right
he
said
just
has
to
complain
i
sure
of
it
cal
answered
with
a
grin
it
took
closer
to
two
hours
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
times
the
space
police
had
made
a
fix
on
their
position
only
too
late
to
catch
them
hovering
there
there
must
have
been
some
fix
made
and
a
pretty
careful
calculation
of
where
they
could
go
next
for
as
they
neared
the
outer
moons
of
jupiter
the
radio
crackled
into
life
again
this
is
your
last
warning
we
intend
to
board
you
and
take
over
we
will
disintegrate
your
ship
if
you
resist
cal
took
the
microphone
in
his
own
hand
to
answer
we
intend
to
keep
going
he
said
this
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
the
attorney
general
office
and
we
will
not
allow
you
to
board
us
and
i
suggest
you
get
confirmation
of
orders
to
disintegrate
us
directly
from
the
attorney
general
in
person
meanwhile
you
can
pass
the
buck
to
your
saturn
patrol
if
those
orders
are
confirmed
tom
nodded
to
frank
and
the
next
jump
key
was
pressed
in
the
saturn
field
still
another
voice
came
through
orders
from
the
attorney
general
himself
are
to
allow
you
to
proceed
say
lynwood
what
is
this
all
about
some
sort
of
petty
squabble
over
who
gives
orders
to
who
lynwood
answered
i
just
work
here
he
added
tiredly
well
said
the
voice
so
do
i
guess
they
fight
it
out
in
the
courts
now
you
understand
we
had
our
orders
you
understand
so
did
i
tom
answered
sure
the
voice
answered
and
cut
out
cal
wondered
whether
the
orders
to
disintegrate
had
been
a
bluff
would
the
attorney
general
have
dared
disintegrate
a
ship
with
even
a
junior
e
on
board
maybe
it
had
been
just
a
threat
of
the
local
police
one
they
did
expect
to
have
called
or
maybe
he
had
played
directly
into
the
attorney
general
hands
by
defying
him
and
getting
that
defiance
on
record
was
what
the
man
had
wanted
whatever
it
was
the
eden
matter
had
become
bigger
than
merely
finding
out
what
had
happened
to
some
colonists
whatever
it
was
he
better
find
a
successful
solution
because
the
attorney
general
was
counting
on
him
to
fail
and
if
he
did
fail
certainly
the
position
of
the
junior
e
would
be
altered
and
possibly
a
deep
thrust
into
the
very
heart
of
the
senior
e
position
as
well
louie
was
right
after
they
cleared
the
solar
system
there
was
no
trouble
getting
eden
and
there
was
no
trouble
circumnavigating
the
globe
while
still
in
space
closer
but
still
outside
the
atmosphere
in
their
surveying
spiral
they
had
no
trouble
in
locating
the
island
with
crystal
palace
mountain
at
its
center
there
was
only
one
such
spot
on
eden
and
in
their
telescope
viewer
its
crystalline
spires
and
minarets
sparkled
back
at
them
like
a
diamond
set
in
jade
the
trouble
began
when
they
hovered
over
the
location
when
they
amplified
their
magnification
to
get
a
close
look
at
the
appletree
village
before
dropping
down
to
land
louie
found
the
right
valley
he
said
it
was
the
right
valley
and
he
stuck
to
his
claim
stubbornly
but
there
was
no
settlement
there
no
sign
there
had
ever
been
louie
could
see
that
for
himself
they
told
him
there
was
nothing
but
virgin
land
the
trees
were
undisturbed
and
old
there
were
splashes
of
rolling
meadows
spotted
here
and
there
by
other
trees
untilled
meadows
sloping
downward
from
the
ridges
to
the
river
and
not
a
blemish
nor
scar
to
show
that
man
had
ever
landed
there
fine
thing
norton
chaffed
him
fine
navigation
louie
get
us
clear
across
the
universe
in
great
shape
and
then
you
ca
even
find
the
landing
field
but
louie
was
in
no
mood
for
banter
he
wished
tom
would
go
back
and
hold
the
manual
controls
of
the
ship
instead
of
letting
it
hover
on
automatic
he
wished
cal
would
go
back
to
his
stateroom
and
think
he
wished
frank
norton
would
shut
up
he
wished
they
would
all
stand
over
him
reading
his
charts
over
his
shoulder
in
irritated
silence
he
reduced
the
viewscope
dimensions
to
scale
and
snapped
a
picture
of
the
whole
island
he
took
the
fresh
picture
still
moist
from
its
camera
and
laid
it
beside
the
chart
wordlessly
for
the
benefit
of
them
all
he
traced
his
pencil
over
the
outlines
of
the
chart
and
their
duplicates
in
the
picture
as
in
comparing
fingerprints
he
flicked
his
pencil
at
the
points
of
identity
there
were
far
too
many
to
ignore
he
poked
the
point
of
his
pencil
at
appletree
where
it
was
located
on
the
chart
then
he
picked
out
the
same
location
in
the
picture
it
was
not
the
science
of
navigation
that
was
wrong
it
just
one
of
those
dirty
tricks
life
plays
on
a
fellow
tom
said
over
cal
shoulder
you
got
us
in
the
right
place
louie
but
probably
in
the
wrong
time
slot
you
warped
us
right
out
of
our
own
time
and
eden
has
been
discovered
yet
maybe
wo
be
for
another
million
years
maybe
back
on
earth
man
is
just
discovering
fire
yeah
norton
agreed
or
maybe
in
the
wrong
dimension
you
and
your
fancy
navigation
now
you
take
a
navigating
machine
it
would
know
how
to
pull
such
fancy
short
cuts
take
a
little
longer
maybe
but
when
we
got
there
we
be
there
they
were
both
talking
nonsense
and
knew
it
time
and
dimensional
travel
were
still
purely
theoretical
louie
ignored
the
ribbing
with
elaborate
patience
you
know
what
i
think
he
asked
seriously
i
think
the
whole
a
hoax
i
betcha
there
never
was
any
settlement
there
i
betcha
the
colonists
have
pulled
a
whingding
all
the
way
through
there
a
whole
raft
of
pictures
to
show
they
were
there
frank
reminded
him
pictures
louie
answered
scornfully
you
think
they
could
fake
pictures
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
where
their
ship
their
escape
ship
he
asked
as
a
clincher
they
did
like
it
here
and
have
gone
off
somewhere
else
and
then
covered
up
by
sending
reports
and
pictures
on
how
things
would
have
developed
if
they
stayed
there
was
a
sense
of
unreality
in
the
whole
conversation
cal
let
the
talk
flow
on
knowing
it
was
a
reaction
to
shock
what
if
a
modern
ocean
liner
pulled
into
the
harbor
of
new
york
to
find
an
untouched
manhattan
island
in
its
virgin
state
it
could
happen
therefore
it
was
to
be
treated
seriously
better
set
up
communication
with
earth
cal
said
quietly
in
e
science
the
unpredictable
the
incredible
the
illogical
could
happen
at
any
time
with
a
mind
more
open
to
acceptance
of
this
he
had
felt
the
run
of
shock
sooner
for
them
the
shock
impact
was
delayed
since
their
minds
rejected
the
illogical
as
unreal
for
him
the
human
shock
came
at
once
and
then
as
e
thinking
took
over
passed
off
sure
cal
lynwood
agreed
it
was
a
measure
of
their
acceptance
that
they
had
quite
normally
fallen
into
using
his
first
name
on
the
emergency
signal
it
took
less
than
three
minutes
to
clear
through
eleven
to
and
then
sixteen
minutes
for
the
operator
at
base
to
find
bill
hayes
sector
chief
hayes
here
the
voice
said
at
last
through
the
speaker
gray
here
on
the
eden
matter
cal
answered
any
other
available
hayes
answered
wong
has
picked
up
on
a
problem
in
the
pleiades
sector
and
left
this
morning
malinkoff
has
given
out
word
not
to
disturb
him
if
the
whole
universe
falls
apart
that
leaves
mcginnis
who
i
believe
is
spending
his
time
working
on
the
defense
against
the
injunction
by
gunderson
an
example
of
the
way
petty
restrictions
can
bring
a
fine
mind
down
to
trivial
problems
but
he
said
call
him
if
you
need
him
please
cal
said
and
you
might
stay
on
while
i
talk
to
him
if
you
not
busy
sure
e
gray
sure
hayes
answered
i
flashing
the
operator
to
locate
mcginnis
seen
anything
of
the
police
ship
yet
i
understand
one
is
following
to
observe
what
you
do
i
sure
it
will
be
a
big
help
cal
said
drily
not
that
it
matters
so
long
as
it
does
get
in
the
way
mcginnis
came
on
at
that
point
i
not
yelling
for
help
yet
cal
told
him
but
here
what
it
is
like
at
this
end
he
sketched
in
the
details
and
heard
a
sharp
gasp
at
the
other
end
from
hayes
now
i
like
to
stay
on
this
problem
he
concluded
his
brief
summary
but
somewhere
there
fifty
colonists
in
trouble
because
this
whole
thing
is
out
of
focus
i
not
a
full
e
and
maybe
their
lives
are
more
important
than
my
ambition
to
do
a
solo
job
certainly
more
important
then
trivial
as
it
is
we
be
playing
right
into
gunderson
hands
if
we
sent
out
a
boy
to
do
a
man
job
dismiss
the
gunderson
side
of
it
mcginnis
said
drily
inconsequential
to
the
main
issue
as
for
that
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
there
never
been
anything
like
this
colonists
have
been
wiped
out
on
other
planets
sure
but
what
happened
left
traces
this
one
is
an
oddball
and
i
say
you
as
well
equipped
to
handle
it
as
anybody
else
i
do
i
do
understand
this
at
all
hayes
said
in
a
worried
voice
who
does
cal
asked
i
say
set
up
for
continuous
communication
i
leave
it
wide
open
here
so
that
everything
we
say
will
come
through
then
if
anything
should
happen
to
us
you
have
the
record
up
to
that
point
it
the
only
thing
we
can
do
hayes
agreed
if
you
think
i
should
come
out
there
to
stand
by
i
do
it
mcginnis
said
but
the
tone
of
his
voice
said
he
hoped
cal
would
shoulder
the
full
responsibility
not
weaken
out
of
a
chance
at
a
real
solo
i
not
crying
uncle
yet
cal
said
but
i
may
have
to
take
you
up
on
the
offer
i
hope
not
but
do
you
anything
is
wrong
hayes
asked
incredulously
he
was
having
the
same
trouble
facing
the
reality
as
the
ship
crew
if
you
were
flying
to
los
angeles
and
found
only
desert
where
the
city
is
supposed
to
be
you
might
assume
something
was
wrong
cal
answered
drily
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
do
you
have
a
recorder
set
up
so
i
can
begin
trying
to
find
out
yes
yes
e
gray
hayes
said
hurriedly
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
he
had
been
interrupting
an
e
conversation
not
once
but
several
times
pardon
the
intrusions
it
was
just
that
i
understand
cal
reassured
him
when
cal
stood
up
from
the
communicator
the
eyes
of
the
crew
were
on
him
overhearing
his
conversation
with
earth
had
sobered
them
made
reality
come
closer
you
think
it
might
be
a
mirage
tom
asked
some
freak
air
current
reflecting
from
another
island
and
superimposing
over
this
one
then
he
answered
himself
no
i
guess
it
is
there
are
enough
discrepancies
let
pan
down
to
the
ground
with
the
scanner
cal
said
take
it
slow
over
the
area
where
the
village
is
supposed
to
be
glad
to
be
doing
something
with
his
hands
lynwood
twisted
the
controls
to
take
them
instantly
in
magnification
to
a
distance
slightly
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
automatic
pilot
caused
the
ship
to
drift
with
the
rotation
of
the
planet
keeping
them
in
fixed
relative
position
they
scanned
the
ground
rod
by
rod
there
were
expanses
of
heavy
tree
and
bush
growth
that
they
could
not
penetrate
some
of
these
trees
grew
where
the
pictures
showed
cleared
fields
buildings
truck
gardens
cattle
pastures
those
big
trees
did
grow
up
in
a
month
since
the
last
colonist
report
louie
said
positively
he
still
clung
to
his
belief
that
it
was
all
a
hoax
cal
made
no
comment
he
was
intent
on
the
scanner
screen
there
were
heavy
foliage
spots
but
there
were
also
bare
areas
covered
by
a
soft
springy
turf
and
patches
of
wild
flowers
but
there
was
no
sign
of
man
or
his
works
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
board
the
glint
of
a
nail
not
a
furrow
not
even
the
scar
of
a
campfire
and
no
indication
that
there
had
ever
been
in
the
sandy
patches
along
the
banks
of
the
small
meandering
river
there
was
not
even
a
footprint
they
swept
the
scanner
down
the
valley
wait
a
minute
cal
said
there
are
some
cows
and
horses
he
held
the
scanner
fixed
while
they
studied
the
animals
in
two
small
herds
the
animals
grazed
contentedly
near
a
patch
of
woods
we
in
the
right
time
slot
then
tom
said
with
an
attempt
to
pick
up
the
spirit
of
treating
it
lightly
they
been
here
else
the
cows
and
horses
would
be
funny
thing
about
those
horses
frank
commented
in
a
puzzled
voice
i
grew
up
on
a
farm
those
are
work
horses
but
field
horses
always
have
harness
marks
on
them
where
the
hair
gets
rubbed
off
or
the
skin
gets
calloused
if
they
used
these
horses
for
work
there
ought
to
be
collar
and
hames
rubs
on
their
necks
there
ought
to
be
worn
streaks
left
by
the
traces
on
their
sides
there
is
far
as
the
evidence
shows
they
might
have
been
wild
all
their
lives
whatever
happened
did
seem
to
hurt
them
any
cal
agreed
he
swept
the
scanner
on
down
the
valley
to
the
sandy
shore
of
the
sea
they
were
close
enough
to
pick
up
the
brown
streaks
of
beached
seaweed
a
flock
of
shore
birds
were
busy
running
up
the
sand
away
from
the
gentle
beaching
waves
then
following
the
water
line
back
down
to
dig
their
beaks
into
the
soft
wet
sand
for
food
the
birds
showed
no
alarm
no
sign
of
lurking
presence
near
them
cal
brought
the
scanner
back
up
the
valley
and
over
to
one
of
the
ridges
bordering
it
high
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
undergrowth
was
less
luxuriant
than
down
in
the
valley
and
it
was
here
they
caught
their
first
glimpse
of
a
human
being
he
was
hunkered
down
behind
some
rocks
at
the
crest
peering
over
them
at
the
valley
below
from
the
shape
of
his
shoulders
and
back
the
set
of
his
head
they
knew
it
to
be
a
man
as
far
as
they
could
tell
he
had
no
clothes
on
apparently
they
had
caught
him
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
at
the
crest
they
watched
him
turn
his
head
as
he
looked
quickly
then
searchingly
up
and
down
the
valley
they
watched
his
hand
come
up
to
shade
his
eyes
against
the
light
from
ceti
as
he
attempted
to
see
into
the
dark
patches
of
foliage
where
the
village
ought
to
be
what
he
saw
or
did
not
see
seemed
to
stun
him
he
squatted
as
frozen
as
a
statue
for
long
moments
then
on
hands
and
knees
they
saw
him
back
away
from
the
crest
now
they
saw
he
did
not
wear
even
so
much
as
a
breechclout
when
the
height
of
the
ridge
concealed
him
from
the
other
side
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
run
zigzagging
in
the
manner
of
an
obstacle
racer
to
avoid
the
bushes
looks
like
they
decided
to
make
a
nudist
colony
of
it
lynwood
commented
and
faked
the
pictures
so
old
earth
people
would
come
out
to
break
it
up
louie
persisted
then
why
should
he
be
so
scared
frank
asked
notice
that
patch
of
bare
dirt
he
crossing
cal
asked
see
the
little
spurts
of
dust
when
he
puts
his
feet
down
now
look
behind
him
the
three
crewmen
leaned
closer
to
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
scanning
screen
cal
adjusted
it
minutely
to
get
a
sharp
focus
on
the
ground
no
footprints
lynwood
exclaimed
he
does
leave
any
footprints
the
three
of
them
looked
at
cal
cal
did
like
what
he
saw
in
louie
eyes
the
habitual
irritation
and
annoyance
with
little
petty
tricks
was
gone
the
look
had
been
replaced
with
fear
and
something
more
the
naked
man
running
frantically
down
the
side
of
the
slope
disappeared
momentarily
under
some
taller
growth
came
out
the
other
side
of
it
still
running
he
leaped
over
a
small
ravine
stumbled
recovered
himself
and
disappeared
again
beneath
a
larger
growth
of
trees
below
him
on
his
side
of
the
ridge
there
lay
another
valley
with
its
own
stream
they
caught
one
more
fleeting
glimpse
a
mere
flash
of
sunlight
on
tan
skin
he
was
still
heading
downward
in
the
direction
of
the
stream
it
was
their
last
sight
of
him
they
watched
for
a
while
longer
but
he
did
not
reappear
under
the
green
canopy
of
forest
just
a
guess
cal
said
he
spoke
in
the
hope
the
casualness
would
wash
the
fear
and
awe
from
louie
eyes
probably
one
of
the
dissident
men
who
broke
away
from
the
main
colony
and
set
up
housekeeping
in
this
adjacent
valley
apparently
the
same
things
have
happened
to
him
as
happened
to
the
main
colony
whatever
it
was
i
guess
it
came
as
pretty
much
of
a
shock
and
he
just
now
worked
up
courage
to
scout
the
main
valley
from
that
i
say
whatever
happened
was
very
long
ago
not
more
than
a
week
just
a
guess
none
of
the
crew
answered
him
it
was
obviously
not
the
case
of
a
voyeur
spying
on
others
not
with
the
kind
of
excitement
the
running
man
had
shown
running
away
that
is
let
drop
down
into
the
atmosphere
cal
suggested
i
assume
it
is
breathable
from
the
fact
we
seen
earth
animals
and
a
human
being
still
we
better
make
tests
yeah
louie
said
unexpectedly
if
the
man
is
making
any
footprints
maybe
he
is
breathing
either
he
tried
to
make
it
a
joke
to
fight
his
fear
with
he
did
succeed
nobody
laughed
he
swallowed
hard
and
studied
the
charts
again
for
no
apparent
reason
cal
glanced
quickly
from
tom
to
frank
a
look
at
norton
face
showed
him
frank
was
very
far
behind
louie
in
the
progress
of
shock
perhaps
as
with
himself
it
was
lynwood
sense
of
responsibility
for
his
crew
that
was
helping
the
pilot
to
maintain
a
better
control
but
there
was
a
white
line
around
lynwood
mouth
running
up
the
line
of
his
jaw
caused
by
clenching
his
teeth
too
tightly
clenched
to
keep
them
from
chattering
however
experienced
a
man
became
however
dependable
the
reactions
one
never
knew
how
to
predict
reaction
in
the
face
of
the
completely
unknown
yet
cal
knew
that
even
if
he
asked
any
of
the
men
if
they
feared
to
take
him
down
it
would
be
an
insult
never
forgotten
it
was
their
job
to
take
an
e
where
he
wanted
to
go
it
would
be
the
first
time
they
had
gambled
their
lives
on
the
judgment
of
an
tom
exclaimed
we
have
company
he
pointed
to
an
indicator
on
the
panel
they
swept
the
space
around
them
with
the
scanner
and
hovering
off
to
one
side
they
picked
up
another
ship
they
watched
it
for
a
while
as
it
hovered
there
it
made
no
move
to
come
closer
no
move
to
communicate
with
them
from
its
markings
tom
said
at
last
i
think
that
a
special
investigation
ship
from
the
attorney
general
office
wonder
what
they
doing
here
to
make
observation
of
my
failure
cal
said
shortly
get
on
with
our
work
perhaps
it
helped
the
crew
to
realize
they
were
not
alone
that
whatever
might
happen
to
them
would
not
only
be
heard
on
the
channel
back
to
earth
but
would
also
be
seen
by
these
special
observers
perhaps
it
bucked
them
up
a
little
to
know
that
they
were
being
watched
that
faltering
uncertainty
would
be
noted
and
scorned
perhaps
it
was
the
mechanical
routine
of
air
sampling
and
testing
as
they
lowered
the
ship
by
degrees
norton
grew
more
relaxed
more
sure
of
himself
lynwood
handled
the
ship
on
manual
control
with
ease
almost
with
flourish
but
louie
hands
gripping
the
edges
of
the
chart
table
still
showed
bloodless
white
at
the
knuckles
perhaps
because
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
the
moment
he
alone
was
snapping
out
of
it
the
tests
showed
normal
atmosphere
it
checked
exactly
with
the
readings
for
this
altitude
established
by
the
surveying
scientists
to
complete
the
record
cal
repeated
them
aloud
each
time
so
the
open
communicator
would
carry
the
information
back
to
earth
where
by
now
not
only
mcginnis
and
hayes
would
be
listening
but
probably
a
group
of
scientists
as
well
perhaps
their
hands
too
gripped
the
edges
of
tables
showed
bloodless
at
the
knuckles
to
wait
helplessly
eleven
away
might
create
more
tenseness
than
being
right
on
the
scene
yet
no
voice
came
through
the
speaker
either
from
earth
or
from
the
observer
ship
perhaps
mcginnis
forgetting
his
eighty
years
wished
now
he
were
at
eden
instead
of
cal
perhaps
mindful
of
his
years
he
did
he
made
no
comment
tom
dropped
the
ship
lower
and
lower
each
time
pausing
for
an
air
sample
each
time
they
scanned
the
valley
where
the
village
of
appletree
should
be
there
was
no
change
now
the
unlikely
idea
of
a
superimposed
mirage
was
dispelled
the
disappearance
of
the
colony
was
no
trick
of
vision
the
ship
hovered
at
the
last
not
more
than
fifty
feet
from
the
ground
let
set
her
down
tom
cal
said
quietly
tom
shrugged
as
if
that
were
the
only
thing
left
to
do
you
the
e
he
said
his
glance
at
louie
showed
he
was
placing
the
responsibility
not
so
much
to
avoid
consequences
for
himself
nor
so
much
to
assure
they
were
willing
to
follow
an
e
orders
without
question
as
to
remind
louie
that
there
was
after
all
an
e
with
them
and
if
he
were
willing
to
face
this
unknown
they
could
hardly
do
less
themselves
but
louie
eyes
were
fixed
in
unblinking
stare
upon
the
ground
below
them
he
was
frozen
and
unheeding
the
actual
landing
was
so
flawless
that
cal
involuntarily
glanced
out
of
the
port
to
confirm
that
they
were
no
longer
hovering
might
as
well
open
up
he
said
nothing
has
happened
to
us
so
far
norton
pushed
a
button
the
exit
hatch
slipped
open
and
the
ramp
unfolded
and
slid
down
to
touch
ground
cal
flanked
by
tom
and
frank
looked
through
the
opening
into
the
woods
beyond
and
while
they
looked
a
man
came
from
behind
the
screening
protection
of
some
shrubbery
he
was
followed
by
two
other
men
all
of
them
were
completely
naked
you
three
stay
inside
the
ship
until
i
signal
you
to
come
out
cal
instructed
if
anything
unusual
happens
to
me
stand
off
from
the
planet
until
help
can
come
from
earth
do
be
foolish
and
try
to
help
me
you
the
e
tom
repeated
when
a
man
is
outside
his
own
knowledge
heroics
might
do
more
harm
than
good
cal
stepped
through
the
exit
and
walked
slowly
down
the
ramp
the
three
colonists
seemed
in
no
panic
they
walked
toward
him
also
slowly
obviously
in
attempt
at
dignified
control
yet
their
faces
were
breaking
into
broad
grins
of
relief
and
welcome
cal
stepped
off
the
ramp
took
a
step
toward
them
then
it
happened
he
heard
breathless
grunts
of
surprise
and
pain
behind
him
he
whirled
around
the
three
crewmen
were
lying
awkwardly
on
the
ground
there
was
no
ship
the
three
crewmen
were
completely
naked
cal
felt
the
stirring
of
a
breeze
and
looked
down
quickly
at
his
own
body
he
also
was
nude
he
turned
back
to
face
the
colonists
they
had
stopped
in
front
of
him
their
joyous
grins
had
been
replaced
by
grimaces
of
despair
behind
him
the
crewmen
were
in
the
act
of
getting
to
their
feet
a
quick
glance
showed
cal
none
was
hurt
louie
looked
around
dazed
and
uncomprehending
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
bent
blade
of
grass
to
show
where
the
ship
weight
had
pressed
louie
sank
down
suddenly
on
the
ground
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
tom
and
frank
stood
over
him
in
the
way
a
man
would
try
to
shield
some
wounded
portion
of
his
own
body
instinctively
a
fact
obvious
to
all
of
them
was
that
their
own
communication
with
earth
had
been
shut
off
in
this
daylight
they
could
not
see
the
observer
ship
hovering
out
in
space
but
its
occupants
had
no
doubt
seen
them
seen
what
had
happened
it
no
doubt
was
telling
earth
what
it
had
seen
the
attorney
general
office
at
any
rate
doubtful
that
it
was
including
in
its
report
problematical
that
the
attorney
general
would
tell
what
had
happened
cal
hoped
the
observers
would
have
enough
sense
not
to
try
to
land
a
second
shock
powerfully
magnified
hit
him
then
because
he
was
personally
involved
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
cal
mind
ceased
to
function
rationally
and
like
an
animal
suddenly
faced
with
the
unknown
he
froze
shrank
within
himself
stood
motionless
yet
far
down
within
his
mind
there
was
still
detached
observation
as
if
a
part
of
him
were
removed
from
all
this
still
in
the
role
of
disinterested
observer
the
crew
behind
him
was
likewise
frozen
in
tableau
and
the
colonists
in
front
of
him
a
balance
in
number
with
himself
in
between
a
still
picture
from
a
modernist
ballet
or
a
charade
guess
what
this
is
he
felt
laughter
bubbling
to
his
lips
recognized
it
for
the
beginning
of
hysteria
and
the
impulse
was
washed
away
with
that
portion
of
detached
curiosity
he
watched
his
mind
functioning
darting
frantically
here
and
there
for
rational
explanation
and
momentarily
taking
refuge
in
irrationality
it
was
all
being
done
with
trick
photography
such
a
sudden
transition
could
take
place
in
a
motion
picture
a
transition
from
reality
into
a
dream
sequence
lying
discarded
on
the
floor
reversion
to
the
primitive
accounting
for
the
phenomena
by
devising
a
mind
more
powerful
than
his
own
the
childhood
view
of
the
omnipotent
parent
reality
disillusionment
the
parent
substitute
the
creation
of
a
god
in
his
parent
image
without
the
weakness
of
his
parent
so
that
he
might
go
on
in
perpetual
irresponsibility
since
he
could
now
place
responsibility
outside
himself
or
this
was
a
fairy
story
in
which
he
lived
this
was
the
spell
of
enchantment
this
was
magic
and
at
the
first
concept
of
magic
the
first
lesson
of
e
sharpened
into
focus
once
more
anything
is
magic
if
you
do
understand
how
it
happens
and
science
if
you
do
in
that
odd
detached
portion
of
his
mind
he
deliberately
used
the
statement
as
a
foundation
upon
it
he
reconstructed
the
science
of
the
universe
and
all
in
it
is
logical
logical
at
least
to
man
because
he
is
part
of
that
universe
of
its
essence
there
can
be
nothing
in
the
universe
that
is
wrong
or
out
of
place
except
and
only
as
the
limited
interpretation
of
man
who
sees
a
force
in
terms
of
a
threat
to
the
ascendancy
of
at
the
center
of
things
this
is
the
sole
basis
of
morality
and
prevents
man
appreciation
of
total
reality
he
had
been
trapped
in
the
first
concept
and
was
accepting
these
phenomena
as
a
statement
of
eminent
authority
but
what
if
this
were
not
the
whole
of
reality
what
then
once
begun
his
mind
progressed
rapidly
through
the
seven
stages
of
e
science
and
in
the
seventh
he
found
rationality
if
there
is
only
one
natural
law
and
we
see
it
only
in
seemingly
unrelated
facets
because
of
our
ignorance
because
we
can
not
apperceive
the
whole
then
this
too
is
no
more
than
another
facet
perhaps
it
was
this
which
broke
the
spell
perhaps
it
was
the
movement
of
the
colonists
they
were
moving
withdrawing
walking
backward
step
by
step
their
faces
were
masks
of
despair
and
in
them
cal
read
the
knowledge
that
what
had
just
happened
to
him
his
men
his
ship
had
previously
happened
to
them
slowly
they
backed
away
backed
out
of
the
open
space
sought
the
shelter
of
a
great
and
spreading
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
there
they
paused
it
was
a
return
to
ballet
a
gravely
executed
change
in
the
proportions
of
the
tableau
they
stood
a
drooped
and
huddled
group
cowering
beneath
the
tree
in
nude
dejection
in
the
suggestion
of
a
wary
crouch
uncertain
whether
to
flee
precipitously
or
freeze
to
make
themselves
as
small
and
inconspicuous
as
possible
in
the
same
grave
choreography
he
turned
to
look
at
his
crew
and
at
the
turning
as
if
on
signal
on
musical
cue
tom
and
frank
began
the
pantomime
of
urging
louie
to
his
feet
louie
looked
at
the
two
standing
men
alternately
with
bloodless
lips
he
tried
to
grin
wryly
apologetically
for
what
his
nervous
system
was
doing
to
his
body
against
his
will
the
old
flash
of
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
this
is
just
the
kind
of
dirty
trick
life
always
plays
on
me
came
back
into
his
eyes
for
an
instant
and
he
tried
to
grin
but
the
attempt
was
a
grimace
of
terror
he
cowered
back
down
at
their
feet
his
courage
swamped
in
funk
let
get
him
under
the
tree
cal
said
and
wondered
why
he
had
spoken
in
such
a
low
voice
almost
a
whisper
that
too
was
a
part
of
the
classical
pattern
of
fear
to
make
no
noise
as
was
getting
him
under
the
tree
an
animal
instinct
to
hide
from
the
eyes
of
the
unknown
as
the
four
of
them
approached
the
tree
with
tom
and
frank
louie
and
he
still
trying
to
make
his
legs
behave
support
him
the
colonists
made
a
fluttering
movement
of
uncertainty
as
if
to
bolt
to
run
in
panic
farther
and
farther
back
into
sheltering
protection
of
the
deep
forest
but
they
stood
their
ground
in
acceptance
the
seven
men
came
together
under
the
protecting
branches
of
the
tree
protection
from
what
louie
sank
down
gratefully
and
clutched
the
trunk
of
the
tree
as
if
on
a
high
place
he
feared
falling
sorry
he
muttered
through
clenched
teeth
just
ca
help
it
one
of
the
colonists
answered
first
the
tall
one
stamped
on
his
face
was
his
origin
the
imperishable
impression
of
the
west
texan
grown
up
in
a
harsh
land
that
can
be
made
responsive
to
man
needs
only
through
strength
his
will
to
survive
against
all
odds
it
figgers
the
man
said
in
his
quiet
drawl
we
all
been
like
that
for
days
maybe
a
week
or
more
lost
count
you
doin
all
right
better
than
some
cal
drew
a
deep
breath
consciously
squared
his
shoulders
fought
off
the
urge
to
like
dejection
then
everybody
still
alive
he
asked
oh
yeah
sure
nobody
just
hidin
out
in
the
woods
and
mostly
from
each
other
it
a
turrible
thing
he
looked
down
at
himself
with
a
wry
grimace
not
outta
shame
he
added
we
seen
naked
bodies
before
just
plumb
scared
i
guess
to
talk
to
hear
himself
talking
and
that
to
strangers
to
tell
somebody
about
it
seemed
to
restore
some
confidence
in
himself
something
of
quiet
dignity
came
back
over
him
a
knowledge
of
responsibility
for
leadership
he
straightened
as
if
silently
reminding
himself
that
he
was
a
man
i
jed
dawkins
he
said
sort
of
the
kingpin
of
the
colony
i
reckon
you
might
say
mayor
of
appletree
or
what
was
appletree
i
rightly
know
if
i
mayor
of
anything
now
this
here
is
ahmed
hussein
and
this
miserable
hunk
o
man
is
dirk
van
tassel
manner
of
speakin
he
amended
he
ai
no
more
miserable
than
the
rest
of
us
i
calvin
gray
cal
answered
he
indicated
his
crew
this
is
tom
lynwood
frank
norton
louie
lebeau
they
all
good
men
just
under
the
weather
right
now
you
seen
us
when
it
first
happened
jed
said
with
feeling
i
reckon
you
the
e
come
to
find
out
why
we
did
communicate
he
spread
his
open
hands
and
waved
them
to
indicate
the
area
around
him
now
you
see
why
we
did
hollerin
loud
as
we
could
would
do
the
job
and
that
all
we
got
left
somehow
the
introductions
relaxed
them
all
a
little
as
if
the
familiar
formality
provided
some
kind
of
normalcy
in
an
incredible
situation
do
seem
right
hospitable
just
standin
here
jed
added
with
a
shrug
but
there
ai
no
house
nor
camp
nor
fire
to
share
with
you
we
not
suffering
at
the
moment
except
mentally
cal
reassured
him
involuntarily
he
glanced
up
at
the
spreading
branches
of
the
tree
as
if
to
reassure
himself
also
then
grinned
in
at
the
pantomime
of
fear
first
thing
is
to
find
out
what
happened
might
as
well
hunker
down
right
here
on
the
ground
jed
said
one
place
is
good
as
another
right
now
the
men
all
crouched
or
sat
on
the
dead
leaves
which
carpeted
the
ground
cal
suddenly
realized
he
was
glad
to
take
the
strain
from
his
legs
as
if
he
had
been
maintaining
stance
through
sheer
will
it
is
a
poor
greeting
to
visitors
from
home
ahmed
spoke
up
then
cleared
his
voice
in
surprise
to
hear
himself
speaking
we
can
not
even
provide
a
cup
of
coffee
cai
have
no
fire
dawkins
explained
see
he
picked
up
two
dead
twigs
laying
on
the
ground
near
him
he
began
rubbing
them
together
in
the
ancient
way
of
creating
fire
the
two
sticks
flew
apart
and
out
of
his
hands
try
it
he
invited
cal
curious
even
unbelieving
cal
picked
up
two
broken
branches
he
started
to
rub
them
together
he
felt
them
twisted
wrenched
and
pulled
out
of
his
hands
he
saw
them
flying
through
the
air
with
a
force
he
had
not
provided
he
got
up
picked
them
up
again
sat
back
down
and
held
the
sticks
very
tightly
in
his
hands
he
tried
to
bring
them
together
suddenly
he
simply
lost
interest
oh
to
hell
with
it
he
said
unexpectedly
and
dropped
the
sticks
his
astonishment
at
himself
was
a
shock
there
was
a
kind
of
chuckle
from
van
tassel
one
without
mirth
kind
of
gets
you
does
it
he
said
cal
looked
at
his
hands
and
at
the
sticks
laying
beside
him
now
why
would
i
do
that
he
asked
all
at
once
it
seemed
unimportant
to
start
a
fire
or
even
try
what
happened
here
what
been
going
on
cai
explain
it
dawkins
said
sort
of
hoped
you
bein
an
e
and
all
maybe
if
you
told
me
just
what
happened
started
at
the
beginning
when
everything
was
normal
something
else
you
should
tell
him
jed
ahmed
spoke
up
he
looked
at
cal
and
explained
himself
we
do
think
easily
he
added
keep
our
minds
on
anything
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
in
fact
i
a
little
surprised
that
we
been
able
to
carry
on
the
conversation
this
long
from
the
way
we
been
behaving
i
would
have
expected
more
that
we
have
wandered
away
back
into
the
woods
before
now
simply
left
you
to
your
own
devices
without
interest
in
you
strange
yeah
jed
confirmed
i
was
thinkin
that
too
funny
thing
right
now
i
feel
like
i
could
tell
the
whole
yarn
i
feel
like
well
while
in
the
mood
i
better
git
it
said
do
know
how
long
i
can
keep
interested
well
there
we
were
one
day
seems
like
it
ought
to
be
about
a
week
ago
give
or
take
a
couple
of
days
anyway
i
remember
it
was
around
noon
it
was
one
day
around
noon
jed
dawkins
had
come
in
early
from
his
experimental
field
to
get
his
dinner
well
city
folks
would
call
it
lunch
and
so
he
be
ready
afterwards
for
a
talk
with
the
colony
committee
he
eaten
his
lunch
all
right
a
good
one
there
was
never
any
scarcity
of
food
on
eden
always
plenty
and
wide
variety
if
anything
a
man
ate
too
much
and
did
have
to
work
hard
enough
to
get
it
that
was
the
main
thing
that
had
been
wrong
with
eden
right
from
the
start
man
was
ordained
to
earn
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
there
no
reason
to
sweat
for
it
on
eden
he
was
lying
on
the
hammock
that
was
stretched
between
two
big
trees
in
the
front
yard
of
his
house
the
house
was
set
a
little
way
off
from
the
rest
of
the
village
oh
maybe
five
hundred
yards
more
or
less
not
so
far
he
could
be
handy
when
he
was
needed
by
the
colony
but
still
far
enough
to
give
a
man
some
space
the
domestic
sound
of
rattled
pots
and
pans
came
from
the
kitchen
window
where
his
wife
martha
was
washing
up
after
dinner
it
was
a
drowsy
peaceful
time
honeybees
they
brought
from
earth
were
buzzing
the
flowers
martha
had
planted
all
around
a
bird
was
singing
up
in
the
trees
above
him
a
man
ought
to
be
pretty
contented
with
a
life
like
that
he
remembered
telling
himself
ought
to
be
he
felt
like
taking
a
nap
but
made
himself
keep
awake
because
the
committee
was
coming
right
over
and
he
did
want
to
wake
up
all
groggy
the
way
a
man
does
when
he
sleeps
in
the
daytime
afford
to
be
groggy
because
the
committee
was
all
set
up
to
scrap
out
something
that
was
splitting
the
colony
right
down
the
middle
he
remembered
looking
out
at
the
fields
where
the
grains
and
vegetables
were
growing
thinking
how
easy
it
was
to
farm
here
plenty
of
rain
plenty
of
sun
no
storms
to
flatten
and
ruin
the
crops
not
even
enough
insect
pests
to
worry
a
man
he
looked
out
at
the
fenced
pastures
where
the
colony
community
stock
grazed
the
horses
had
eaten
their
fill
and
were
ambling
up
from
the
drinking
pond
getting
ready
to
take
a
siesta
of
their
own
in
the
shade
of
some
trees
at
the
corner
of
their
pasture
the
cows
were
already
lying
down
in
a
grove
of
trees
and
were
sleepily
chewing
their
cuds
the
green
grass
around
them
was
so
tall
he
could
barely
see
their
heads
and
backs
his
house
was
on
top
of
a
little
hill
knoll
you
might
call
it
martha
like
himself
had
been
raised
in
west
texas
where
all
you
could
see
as
the
city
feller
said
was
miles
and
miles
of
miles
and
miles
she
never
could
stand
not
being
able
to
see
a
long
ways
off
and
she
picked
out
this
spot
herself
they
could
see
all
the
valley
and
the
sea
and
some
dim
shapes
of
islands
in
the
distance
right
nice
yes
it
was
all
very
peaceful
and
tame
that
was
the
main
trouble
in
the
colony
too
tame
some
of
them
got
restless
they
argued
the
test
was
all
right
for
most
planets
you
needed
every
bit
of
it
to
prove
that
man
could
make
it
there
or
could
or
how
much
help
he
would
need
from
earth
maybe
for
a
while
maybe
always
on
eden
you
did
have
to
prove
anything
there
was
anything
to
make
a
man
feel
like
a
man
proud
to
be
one
maybe
that
would
be
all
right
for
ordinary
folks
but
for
experimental
colonists
it
was
a
slow
death
almost
as
bad
as
living
on
earth
sure
they
made
their
complaints
to
earth
half
a
dozen
times
or
maybe
more
they
asked
for
an
inspector
to
come
out
and
see
for
himself
and
see
what
it
was
doing
to
the
colonists
jed
put
it
right
up
to
that
they
were
plumb
ruining
a
prime
batch
of
colonists
with
this
easy
living
a
man
had
to
stretch
himself
once
in
a
while
if
he
expected
to
grow
tall
some
of
the
colonists
were
getting
so
lazy
they
stopped
bitching
and
were
even
talking
about
maybe
just
staying
on
here
after
the
experimental
was
over
maybe
getting
a
doctor
to
reverse
the
operation
so
they
could
have
kids
which
of
course
you
could
have
in
an
experimental
colony
and
that
was
bad
what
with
easy
living
and
wanting
kids
as
was
normal
to
most
experimental
colonists
were
so
plentiful
that
earth
could
afford
to
lose
any
some
of
the
colonists
wanted
to
leave
this
well
they
called
it
a
lotus
land
whatever
that
was
right
away
before
everybody
went
under
got
plumb
ruined
they
were
all
for
taking
the
escape
ship
and
hightailing
it
back
to
earth
sure
they
knew
there
be
a
stink
and
they
get
a
little
black
mark
in
somebody
book
for
not
obeying
orders
to
stick
it
out
but
that
was
better
than
losing
their
trade
their
desire
to
follow
it
maybe
there
be
a
penalty
and
they
be
marooned
to
stay
on
earth
for
a
while
but
they
bet
there
was
a
hundred
planets
laying
idle
right
now
because
there
were
enough
experimentals
to
go
around
they
get
a
black
mark
but
after
a
while
they
get
another
job
too
anyway
living
on
earth
could
be
any
worse
for
them
than
living
here
half
of
them
wanted
to
stay
here
permanently
the
other
half
wanted
to
leave
right
now
that
was
what
the
committee
was
going
to
decide
today
he
done
some
checking
around
and
it
looked
like
they
were
going
to
vote
to
go
he
also
checked
with
them
who
wanted
to
stay
permanently
and
it
looked
like
in
a
showdown
they
come
along
they
were
proud
to
be
men
too
men
and
women
everybody
would
join
he
been
pretty
sure
of
it
even
the
dissenters
who
moved
away
across
the
ridge
that
was
the
trouble
with
them
there
had
been
enough
hardship
to
bind
the
community
together
people
forgot
how
to
be
kind
to
one
another
and
get
along
when
there
was
any
hardship
to
share
among
themselves
it
would
mean
deserting
the
planet
entirely
even
though
his
sympathies
were
with
the
ones
who
wanted
to
go
jed
felt
there
was
something
wrong
real
bad
about
deserting
the
planet
still
and
all
if
they
voted
to
go
he
could
stop
them
maybe
earth
would
let
the
colonists
come
on
out
without
the
total
test
period
but
maybe
not
maybe
would
decide
that
eden
was
too
hard
to
colonize
because
it
was
too
easy
maybe
abandon
the
planet
entirely
there
be
no
more
humans
here
and
no
more
coming
that
was
when
he
hit
the
ground
with
a
solid
thump
he
first
thought
the
hammock
had
somehow
twisted
out
from
under
him
and
he
looked
up
at
it
resentfully
the
way
a
man
blames
something
else
for
his
own
fault
there
was
any
hammock
at
the
same
time
he
heard
martha
cry
out
he
craned
his
neck
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
house
there
was
any
house
martha
was
standing
there
on
bare
ground
and
there
was
a
thing
else
not
a
stove
nor
a
chair
a
dish
nothing
and
martha
did
have
a
stitch
of
clothes
on
her
his
first
thought
was
that
she
ought
to
have
more
sense
than
to
stand
right
out
in
the
yard
plumb
naked
what
was
the
matter
with
her
anyhow
he
peered
quickly
down
toward
the
village
to
see
if
anybody
was
looking
up
in
this
direction
the
whole
thing
hit
him
like
a
blow
on
top
the
head
there
was
any
hammock
there
was
any
house
there
was
any
village
he
saw
a
whole
passel
of
people
squirming
around
down
there
where
the
village
ought
to
be
they
were
standing
or
crouched
or
lying
around
as
if
they
fallen
down
and
every
one
of
the
crazy
galoots
was
plumb
naked
and
so
was
he
he
just
realized
it
it
had
all
happened
so
quietly
that
that
fool
bird
up
in
the
tree
was
still
singing
had
missed
a
note
funny
how
a
thing
like
that
stood
out
above
all
the
rest
still
singing
jed
got
up
on
his
knees
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
dodged
behind
a
tree
fine
lot
of
authority
he
have
as
village
mayor
if
anybody
saw
him
standing
out
in
his
front
yard
naked
as
a
jay
bird
the
reminder
of
his
responsibility
caused
him
to
sweep
his
eyes
beyond
the
sight
of
the
village
to
where
their
spaceship
should
be
in
its
hangar
always
ready
for
instant
escape
if
anything
should
go
wrong
real
wrong
that
is
this
ship
was
there
the
hangar
was
there
nothing
for
a
little
bit
he
thought
he
must
be
looking
in
the
wrong
direction
he
got
turned
around
or
something
in
the
confusion
because
there
was
a
grove
of
trees
where
the
hangar
ought
to
be
and
it
was
the
same
grove
they
cleared
away
over
two
years
ago
he
recognized
one
of
the
trees
because
it
had
a
peculiar
shape
and
he
remembered
feeding
the
trunk
of
that
very
tree
into
the
power
saw
for
lumber
it
was
twisted
and
gnarled
and
martha
had
asked
him
to
save
the
wood
for
furniture
because
it
was
real
pretty
that
was
the
tree
there
on
the
edge
of
the
grove
he
felt
drunk
in
a
daze
he
turned
the
other
direction
and
looked
out
where
the
experimental
fields
ought
to
be
they
cleared
that
whole
area
of
timber
and
brush
because
it
was
a
good
flat
land
only
they
had
because
that
was
virgin
forest
too
maybe
he
gone
insane
he
felt
a
flood
of
relief
sure
that
was
it
he
just
gone
insane
that
was
all
everything
else
was
all
right
the
calves
have
got
loose
to
the
cows
and
they
going
to
take
all
the
milk
jed
he
turned
around
and
looked
at
martha
if
he
was
crazy
so
was
she
her
eyes
showed
it
her
words
showed
it
at
a
time
like
this
to
be
worrying
about
them
fool
calves
getting
out
it
took
all
the
comfort
away
from
him
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
were
dazed
you
got
some
dirt
on
your
cheek
martha
he
heard
himself
saying
and
for
pete
sake
woman
put
on
some
clothes
the
committee
coming
over
and
you
running
around
like
that
he
thought
he
had
the
solution
then
he
fallen
asleep
in
the
hammock
after
all
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
committee
and
he
was
dreaming
of
course
he
ought
to
have
known
all
along
this
was
just
the
way
things
happened
in
a
dream
even
him
and
martha
running
around
naked
he
even
chuckled
to
himself
he
must
be
a
pretty
moral
kind
of
fellow
after
all
because
even
in
a
dream
it
was
his
own
wife
that
was
next
to
him
there
naked
not
some
other
man
the
fool
things
a
man
can
dream
might
as
well
make
the
most
of
it
he
took
her
into
his
arms
and
she
clung
to
him
must
have
got
the
sheet
tangled
around
his
throat
to
choke
him
and
he
was
dreaming
it
was
her
arms
but
there
had
been
any
sheet
in
the
hammock
when
he
went
to
sleep
and
he
was
dreaming
what
happened
jed
she
whispered
even
her
whisper
was
shaking
with
fear
and
her
arms
were
wound
around
his
neck
so
tight
now
he
could
hardly
breathe
now
now
martha
he
cautioned
do
you
go
getting
hysterical
what
has
happened
she
asked
again
i
do
know
he
said
they
were
both
talking
in
low
tones
it
some
kind
of
a
miracle
she
whispered
now
there
a
woman
thinking
for
you
he
chided
her
fondly
joshing
her
a
little
nothing
of
the
sort
it
just
plain
well
any
scientist
would
tell
you
that
and
then
he
stopped
he
was
pretty
sure
the
frameworks
of
science
as
he
knew
them
would
be
able
to
tell
you
he
guessed
that
while
they
stood
there
clinging
to
one
another
they
both
went
a
little
nuts
it
was
sort
of
like
drowning
he
guessed
have
the
feeling
of
sinking
down
and
down
and
there
be
nothing
but
blinding
swirling
chaos
all
around
you
then
you
kind
of
come
to
for
a
minute
and
there
be
the
trees
the
sky
the
farm
animals
the
sea
in
the
distance
you
look
down
toward
the
village
and
make
a
mental
note
almost
absently
that
people
were
getting
to
their
feet
now
some
of
them
clinging
together
the
way
you
and
martha
were
and
then
back
down
into
mental
chaos
you
go
again
that
went
on
several
times
he
remembered
before
he
begun
to
snap
out
of
it
a
little
but
the
funniest
thing
of
all
jed
said
and
looked
at
cal
quickly
penetratingly
i
had
the
feeling
all
the
time
that
we
were
being
watched
cal
said
nothing
you
know
jed
explained
like
catching
an
animal
in
a
trap
then
watching
it
to
see
what
it
will
do
cal
nodded
without
speaking
it
was
just
another
crazy
thought
i
guess
jed
said
deprecatingly
plumb
crazy
but
clearly
he
did
believe
it
was
at
on
earth
communication
had
been
working
fine
the
operator
sat
back
and
listened
with
trained
ear
alert
for
flaw
or
fade
a
glance
at
the
adjacent
recording
instrument
told
him
it
was
taking
down
everything
said
had
been
for
hours
nice
deal
about
those
naked
colonists
maybe
the
astronavigator
on
the
e
cruiser
had
been
right
maybe
they
all
just
gone
back
to
nature
all
the
way
back
he
wondered
if
there
were
any
pretty
young
female
colonists
and
how
far
did
that
word
experimental
take
you
some
experiment
he
realized
his
interest
was
running
deeper
than
that
of
a
detached
technician
concern
for
equipment
mechanical
that
is
well
let
it
live
a
little
once
in
a
while
at
least
dream
the
department
supervisor
hovered
near
the
back
of
the
operator
chair
breathing
down
his
neck
he
gnawed
at
the
knuckles
of
his
hand
and
hoped
nothing
would
go
wrong
this
time
that
astronavigator
louie
lebeau
was
probably
right
those
colonists
had
turned
nudist
and
were
afraid
to
report
what
they
done
back
to
earth
well
he
looked
around
guiltily
wondering
if
he
exclaimed
it
aloud
he
decided
he
had
if
were
out
there
instead
of
that
e
make
them
put
their
clothes
back
on
on
the
double
getting
everything
all
upset
causing
all
this
trouble
getting
everybody
excited
all
of
aroused
taking
up
the
time
of
an
e
just
because
they
wanted
to
frolic
around
without
any
clothes
on
if
they
were
going
to
act
like
irresponsible
children
they
should
be
spanked
like
irresponsible
children
he
wondered
if
there
were
any
young
pretty
female
colonists
who
ought
to
be
spanked
e
gray
has
just
stepped
off
the
landing
ramp
the
pilot
out
there
was
reporting
he
is
walking
toward
the
three
colonists
now
they
have
started
walking
toward
him
they
do
not
seem
hostile
they
seem
glad
to
see
us
my
crew
and
i
are
still
at
our
stations
ready
for
silence
the
set
simply
did
register
anything
more
except
that
faint
sigh
of
uncompleted
force
fields
in
space
what
now
what
now
the
supervisor
pushed
the
operator
to
one
side
and
barely
restrained
the
impulse
to
cuff
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
now
what
did
you
do
why
did
you
meddle
with
it
when
it
was
coming
in
so
clear
and
strong
what
happened
i
did
do
anything
i
did
meddle
with
it
i
do
know
happened
the
operator
flared
back
the
signal
just
stopped
all
there
was
an
imperative
flashing
of
the
signal
light
on
the
line
that
had
been
rigged
to
give
direct
connection
of
the
running
report
to
hayes
office
the
operator
hesitated
then
flipped
open
the
key
as
if
he
were
touching
a
rattlesnake
what
happened
down
there
hayes
complained
abruptly
without
diplomatic
softness
this
is
a
very
crucial
point
i
do
know
what
happened
i
do
know
the
supervisor
quarreled
back
the
signal
just
stopped
coming
we
were
doing
anything
to
the
equipment
he
looked
up
at
the
continuously
changing
star
map
which
made
the
far
wall
appear
to
be
a
view
into
a
miniature
universe
there
no
reason
for
an
occlusion
he
said
to
hayes
and
the
set
here
is
alive
it
must
be
at
the
other
end
he
turned
to
the
operator
and
said
loudly
bounce
a
beam
on
surface
just
see
if
any
booster
has
gone
out
between
here
and
there
most
of
it
was
making
a
show
of
efficiency
for
hayes
here
we
go
again
the
operator
mumbled
to
himself
and
pressed
down
a
key
the
returning
pips
showed
the
signal
was
getting
through
to
eden
pilot
lynwood
pilot
lynwood
the
supervisor
nagged
into
the
mike
speak
up
do
you
hear
me
the
operator
sighed
deeply
his
panel
partner
grimaced
something
halfway
between
a
grin
and
a
sneer
of
disgust
they
do
answer
the
supervisor
said
at
last
to
hayes
it
the
same
as
before
here
we
go
again
hayes
groaned
but
not
only
to
himself
all
right
he
said
wearily
after
a
moment
hesitation
keep
the
channel
open
keep
trying
to
contact
them
let
me
know
if
signal
resumes
but
he
already
felt
the
conviction
that
it
would
do
no
good
it
was
too
much
of
the
same
pattern
as
before
what
could
have
happened
there
have
to
be
another
review
he
supposed
a
longer
and
more
detailed
one
there
must
be
had
to
be
something
they
overlooked
in
the
first
one
had
he
been
right
in
freezing
out
so
many
who
wanted
to
speculate
in
that
first
one
but
in
the
interests
of
time
the
scientists
would
grumble
even
worse
than
before
because
now
each
one
of
them
would
be
worried
lest
it
was
his
own
field
of
knowledge
that
had
failed
hunting
a
needle
in
a
haystack
was
easy
at
least
you
knew
what
a
needle
looked
like
could
recognize
it
when
you
saw
it
it
would
probably
all
end
with
nothing
solved
e
mcginnis
would
go
out
in
a
rescue
ship
he
already
told
e
gray
that
he
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
and
this
looked
like
an
emergency
and
that
would
leave
without
a
single
e
in
residence
why
did
general
administration
get
busy
and
qualify
more
e
it
should
be
so
difficult
as
all
that
to
teach
people
to
think
there
was
something
mighty
wrong
with
the
way
kids
were
brought
up
if
only
one
in
a
million
could
still
think
by
the
time
he
was
grown
less
than
one
in
a
million
could
qualify
as
an
a
boy
had
to
be
a
natural
rebel
to
start
with
because
if
he
believed
what
people
said
he
would
get
anywhere
no
farther
than
the
people
who
said
it
and
if
he
did
believe
what
they
told
him
they
punished
him
outcast
him
whipped
him
violenced
him
into
submission
if
they
could
if
they
could
they
shut
him
up
in
a
prison
labeled
him
dangerous
to
society
it
was
a
wonder
that
any
were
able
to
walk
the
thin
line
between
rebelliousness
and
delinquency
and
if
a
few
were
able
they
were
still
of
no
use
unless
they
learned
what
science
had
to
offer
as
a
base
ah
there
was
the
rub
how
to
keep
alive
the
curiosity
the
inquisitiveness
the
skepticism
and
at
the
same
time
teach
him
the
basics
he
must
have
for
constructive
thought
for
if
he
were
not
beaten
into
submission
by
the
punitive
methods
of
society
he
was
persuaded
into
it
by
his
teachers
who
were
ever
so
sure
of
their
facts
and
proofs
now
you
take
this
eden
problem
probably
would
be
tough
at
all
if
a
guy
could
just
think
but
what
could
have
happened
he
understood
there
was
an
observer
ship
out
there
sent
out
by
the
attorney
general
office
why
was
it
reporting
probably
was
to
the
attorney
general
office
fine
lot
of
good
would
get
out
of
that
he
was
no
fool
he
knew
the
attorney
general
would
gladly
sacrifice
the
whole
lot
of
colonists
if
it
would
give
him
a
weapon
to
fight
why
had
sent
along
an
observer
ship
also
these
cocky
e
probably
had
thought
it
necessary
always
ready
to
assume
they
could
handle
the
situation
by
themselves
he
wondered
if
he
dared
voice
that
criticism
during
the
review
get
it
on
record
he
thought
about
it
and
decided
in
favor
of
playing
it
safe
maybe
that
was
the
trouble
everybody
was
too
concerned
with
his
own
skin
too
willing
to
play
it
safe
but
an
employee
of
to
make
a
public
criticism
of
an
e
no
better
play
it
safe
he
sighed
heavily
and
asked
the
operator
to
please
see
if
e
mcginnis
would
talk
to
him
he
suspected
that
e
mcginnis
would
just
stand
off
from
the
planet
and
wait
for
e
gray
to
get
in
touch
nothing
seemed
to
have
happened
while
e
gray
cruiser
was
out
in
space
it
must
be
something
connected
with
landing
being
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
but
e
gray
could
signal
to
e
mcginnis
those
pesky
colonists
why
they
signaled
to
e
gray
why
had
they
come
out
of
their
bushes
and
signaled
the
danger
surely
they
must
know
what
it
was
they
were
alive
and
healthy
three
of
them
at
least
why
had
they
used
their
stupid
heads
but
then
how
could
they
have
known
e
gray
was
out
in
space
or
even
in
their
stratosphere
well
they
had
telescopes
did
they
or
did
they
sure
they
did
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
buildings
they
must
have
all
sorts
of
equipment
hidden
under
the
trees
or
in
caves
why
had
e
gray
been
more
cautious
about
landing
rushing
in
there
like
a
green
school
kid
without
even
rudimentary
precautions
what
came
from
sending
out
a
boy
to
do
a
man
job
maybe
the
attorney
general
office
had
been
right
in
its
attempt
to
prevent
a
junior
from
going
what
was
the
use
of
all
that
e
training
if
the
boy
did
have
enough
sense
at
least
e
mcginnis
would
have
enough
sense
to
stand
off
not
go
rushing
in
blindly
grand
old
man
e
mcginnis
now
there
was
a
product
of
e
science
the
veritable
dean
of
the
e
e
gray
would
probably
have
enough
sense
to
know
he
be
followed
by
a
rescue
ship
as
soon
as
something
went
wrong
and
between
an
e
out
in
space
and
another
on
the
ground
they
should
have
any
trouble
in
working
it
out
he
wondered
if
he
should
suggest
that
to
e
mcginnis
as
soon
as
the
operator
located
him
even
if
the
grand
lovable
old
man
thought
of
it
for
himself
he
compliment
hayes
for
thinking
it
reasoning
it
all
out
the
intercom
operator
came
on
his
line
sir
she
said
and
cleared
her
throat
he
could
hear
her
gulp
her
voice
was
very
small
thin
sir
she
began
again
i
contacted
e
mcginnis
he
said
some
things
he
told
me
to
tell
you
exactly
what
he
said
word
for
word
i
took
it
down
in
shorthand
so
i
could
well
well
he
exclaimed
impatiently
his
brusqueness
seemed
to
give
her
courage
sir
she
said
a
little
stronger
e
mcginnis
wo
talk
to
you
he
says
the
foggy
rambling
way
that
review
was
conducted
was
a
disgrace
he
says
why
do
you
get
on
with
what
you
have
to
do
instead
of
bothering
people
he
says
not
to
waste
any
more
of
his
time
unless
you
can
come
up
with
something
he
does
already
know
he
says
he
doubts
you
know
what
that
was
even
if
it
hit
you
in
the
face
he
said
to
tell
you
the
exact
words
so
i
took
it
down
in
shorthand
so
i
could
because
he
said
to
she
was
all
but
wailing
as
she
finished
all
right
hayes
sighed
tiredly
senile
old
devil
no
wonder
things
were
going
to
pot
if
this
was
a
sample
of
e
training
send
me
your
notes
so
i
can
follow
them
carefully
he
told
the
operator
so
you
can
tear
them
up
before
they
get
spread
all
over
the
joint
she
mumbled
but
she
had
already
thrown
the
key
so
he
could
hear
her
resignedly
because
he
knew
he
was
going
to
catch
it
from
the
scientists
just
as
bad
because
he
was
feeling
very
sorry
for
himself
that
he
must
always
be
in
the
middle
of
things
he
began
to
arouse
the
scientists
he
felt
so
sorry
for
himself
that
he
dropped
his
tentative
plan
to
have
the
check
the
personal
attributes
of
the
individual
colonists
out
there
to
see
if
some
of
them
might
be
young
pretty
female
as
if
the
idea
were
now
red
hot
he
dropped
the
plan
of
telling
general
administration
that
since
eden
was
in
his
sector
perhaps
he
should
go
out
there
personally
the
observer
ship
with
an
assistant
attorney
general
aboard
was
indeed
reporting
directly
to
the
attorney
general
office
to
gunderson
in
person
on
their
own
secret
channel
of
course
had
to
be
secret
all
right
for
them
to
know
because
they
were
very
special
persons
but
the
people
should
not
be
told
gray
is
coming
out
of
the
ship
the
assistant
was
saying
he
is
starting
down
the
ramp
he
is
alone
he
has
no
apparent
weapons
making
a
grandstand
play
of
it
far
as
we
can
tell
the
crew
is
covering
him
now
he
is
at
the
foot
of
the
ramp
the
three
unclothed
men
are
moving
toward
him
spread
out
a
little
crouching
obviously
going
to
attack
the
stupid
fool
does
seem
to
realize
it
he
wait
a
minute
i
do
believe
it
well
what
gunderson
exploded
from
his
end
sir
the
assistant
gulped
the
ship
disappeared
just
like
that
nonsense
no
sir
it
did
the
three
crewmen
are
sprawled
on
the
ground
now
two
of
them
are
getting
up
there
is
a
sign
of
the
ship
the
ramp
or
anything
ca
be
has
to
be
around
somewhere
no
sir
is
sorry
to
contradict
you
sir
it
is
anywhere
they
probably
set
controls
to
send
the
ship
back
into
space
and
jumped
out
before
it
took
off
search
space
you
find
it
ships
just
disappear
i
search
of
course
but
this
ship
just
disappeared
all
right
what
going
on
what
else
they
naked
naked
as
the
day
they
were
born
all
four
of
them
same
as
the
colonists
keep
track
of
where
they
put
their
clothes
photograph
it
get
the
evidence
sir
their
clothes
disappeared
right
off
their
bodies
first
they
were
fully
dressed
gray
was
anyhow
maybe
the
crew
could
have
undressed
inside
the
ship
but
gray
was
fully
dressed
and
then
he
was
just
like
that
shall
i
land
sir
place
them
under
arrest
wait
a
minute
let
think
of
a
good
charge
something
to
stand
up
in
court
have
to
make
this
airtight
right
from
the
beginning
in
case
some
stupid
judge
decides
to
make
a
show
of
independence
indecent
exposure
sir
lewd
public
behavior
pretty
weak
in
view
of
what
involved
a
suggestion
sir
maybe
a
morals
charge
is
the
most
effective
weapon
we
could
have
attack
the
e
structure
on
the
grounds
of
bad
scientific
judgment
and
every
egghead
on
earth
will
feel
compelled
to
rise
up
in
their
defense
except
of
course
those
employed
by
the
government
but
on
a
morals
charge
there
would
be
one
voice
raised
fear
of
being
tarred
with
the
same
brush
except
maybe
a
few
radicals
that
are
already
discredited
any
other
charge
might
get
public
sentiment
aroused
against
us
but
a
morals
charge
think
of
the
backing
we
get
from
the
clubs
all
the
pressure
groups
determined
to
dictate
to
the
rest
of
the
world
how
it
should
behave
it
worked
for
hundreds
of
years
sir
never
fails
gunderson
mused
you
may
be
right
shall
i
land
sir
make
the
arrest
you
got
plenty
of
photographic
evidence
all
we
need
sir
at
least
for
the
lewd
public
indecent
exposure
charge
wait
a
minute
how
about
the
colonists
got
pictures
of
them
the
three
men
sir
no
others
let
do
rush
into
this
gunderson
said
slowly
without
a
ship
they
not
going
to
get
far
hold
off
and
keep
taking
pictures
maybe
we
can
get
something
stronger
on
gray
than
just
an
indecent
exposure
or
at
least
get
some
pictures
that
could
be
interpreted
as
more
than
just
that
get
pictures
of
as
many
colonists
as
possible
too
in
case
they
gone
nudist
you
want
to
prosecute
the
colonists
too
might
be
a
smart
idea
that
way
nobody
could
claim
we
been
gunning
for
the
junior
make
it
impartial
play
no
favorites
even
if
we
decided
not
to
prosecute
we
have
the
pictures
in
their
dossiers
so
that
anytime
in
the
future
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
if
any
of
them
gave
us
any
trouble
we
could
quietly
let
them
know
what
we
got
and
they
just
fold
up
and
quit
that
worked
for
hundreds
of
years
too
yes
sir
smart
thinking
sir
the
assistant
knew
that
already
gunderson
had
adopted
the
idea
as
his
own
and
to
hold
his
job
better
let
gunderson
go
on
thinking
so
of
course
if
the
idea
should
backfire
then
gunderson
would
remember
quickly
enough
where
it
had
originated
you
know
gunderson
was
saying
this
could
work
out
all
right
if
their
ship
gone
they
not
communicating
with
and
if
they
not
communicating
will
send
out
another
ship
to
see
why
maybe
there
be
an
e
on
it
i
hear
the
only
one
available
is
mcginnis
that
guy
who
planning
to
fight
us
on
that
injunction
now
suppose
he
landed
suppose
he
went
nudist
or
we
could
make
pictures
look
like
he
did
the
guy
would
have
to
undress
sometime
take
a
bath
slap
a
morals
charge
on
him
nobody
with
a
public
reputation
ever
fights
a
charge
like
that
guilty
or
innocent
they
pay
up
or
knuckle
under
to
keep
it
quiet
have
for
hundreds
of
years
always
will
as
long
as
a
bunch
of
fat
old
ugly
biddies
male
and
female
who
nobody
wants
that
way
are
viciously
resentful
that
they
ca
have
what
somebody
else
is
enjoying
young
ones
too
so
twisted
and
warped
with
frustrations
they
do
dare
try
what
they
daydream
about
they
even
worse
yeah
a
morals
charge
is
the
way
to
get
at
him
but
i
understood
there
was
a
law
that
we
could
charge
an
e
for
any
offense
we
can
try
him
in
the
newspapers
ca
we
on
the
televiewers
the
whole
point
we
ca
charge
an
e
now
but
wait
until
we
get
things
stirred
up
on
a
morals
basis
that
law
be
changed
in
a
hurry
because
any
legislator
that
tried
to
hold
out
against
changing
it
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
by
his
constituents
and
has
enough
sense
to
know
it
he
breathed
in
satisfaction
that
the
way
to
go
about
it
do
know
why
i
have
thought
of
it
before
if
you
guys
would
read
your
history
of
how
police
enforcement
officers
got
things
back
under
control
each
time
some
idealist
started
squawking
about
human
rights
you
think
of
these
things
too
now
do
go
off
just
stand
by
keep
me
posted
on
every
move
if
i
got
to
do
the
thinking
on
how
to
get
those
e
back
under
police
control
the
way
scientists
were
before
i
got
to
have
information
and
keep
taking
pictures
after
everything
disappeared
the
buildings
the
escape
ship
everything
cal
reviewed
and
you
with
your
wife
found
yourself
crouching
under
the
trees
in
what
had
been
your
front
yard
without
any
clothes
on
what
then
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
jed
dawkins
answered
he
looked
toward
his
two
companions
as
if
for
confirmation
he
looked
at
the
three
crewmen
at
cal
all
sprawled
or
crouched
there
beneath
the
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
we
thought
it
was
the
end
of
everything
he
said
in
retrospect
but
we
found
out
quick
that
things
had
just
begun
cal
nodded
dawkins
had
told
his
tale
simply
without
fictitious
emotionalism
without
straining
to
get
the
horror
of
it
across
and
thereby
succeeded
he
glanced
at
his
three
crewmen
to
see
how
they
were
faring
louie
seemed
to
have
gained
some
control
over
his
nerves
and
yet
the
way
he
sat
there
staring
at
nothing
showed
he
was
enduring
some
special
horror
of
his
own
frank
norton
shifted
his
position
pulled
a
dry
stick
from
beneath
the
leaves
looked
at
it
resentfully
and
tossed
it
aside
he
settled
back
down
and
indicated
by
his
expression
that
now
he
could
be
more
comfortable
one
grateful
fact
the
day
was
warm
the
breeze
under
the
tree
was
gentle
the
ground
on
which
they
sat
was
not
too
wet
for
comfort
except
for
custom
for
modesty
clothes
were
really
needed
and
perhaps
the
shock
of
being
without
them
would
pass
nudists
on
earth
claimed
that
one
very
quickly
lost
all
if
no
one
were
clothed
that
such
was
part
of
the
value
that
sex
for
instance
became
less
of
an
issue
instead
of
more
because
without
concealment
one
could
see
instead
of
imagining
and
the
sight
more
often
discouraged
than
enticed
cal
wondered
what
the
militant
moralists
would
make
of
the
idea
that
clothes
encouraged
immorality
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
believe
jed
was
saying
it
was
like
a
natural
thing
like
a
cyclone
or
earthquake
or
fire
or
flood
like
that
them
things
a
man
can
understand
even
if
he
dyin
at
least
he
knows
he
understands
what
killin
him
i
never
thought
hear
myself
say
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
know
what
you
was
dyin
of
but
believe
me
he
broke
off
and
stared
in
front
of
himself
his
voice
took
on
a
note
of
perplexity
only
nobody
died
nobody
even
got
hurt
we
was
like
little
kids
screamin
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
when
they
ai
hurt
at
all
only
scared
he
looked
abashed
i
got
to
tell
you
real
truthful
he
said
most
of
the
yellin
came
from
the
men
the
women
by
and
large
was
real
swell
fact
is
he
continued
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
recollect
ever
seein
a
woman
in
real
hysterics
plenty
of
fake
of
course
say
tryin
to
hook
some
man
into
protectin
her
or
lay
public
blame
on
him
for
not
doin
it
other
times
in
real
danger
womenfolks
our
kind
of
womenfolks
anyhow
they
pitch
right
in
and
help
it
takes
a
man
to
make
a
jackass
outta
himself
at
the
wrong
time
cal
nodded
and
smiled
there
was
an
attempt
at
a
hollow
laugh
from
louie
as
if
the
shoe
had
fit
jed
did
seem
to
realize
it
and
made
no
apology
about
present
company
being
excepted
it
was
like
the
aftermath
of
a
storm
either
jed
said
where
you
begin
pickin
up
the
pieces
to
start
over
we
we
could
pick
up
any
pieces
they
could
pick
up
any
pieces
in
a
way
that
was
worse
than
the
disappearance
of
things
in
a
catastrophe
after
taking
care
of
those
that
are
hurt
first
thing
a
man
does
is
gather
the
materials
and
tools
to
fix
things
up
again
the
women
after
soothing
them
that
hurt
taking
care
of
them
as
much
as
possible
first
thing
they
think
of
is
making
hot
coffee
maybe
hot
soup
that
was
when
they
began
to
realize
this
was
more
than
the
desolation
following
a
cyclone
or
other
freak
of
nature
cal
wanted
to
know
what
happened
well
there
he
was
still
sort
of
hiding
behind
his
tree
it
was
martha
who
snapped
out
of
it
first
who
insisted
that
clothes
or
no
clothes
it
was
their
plain
duty
to
get
down
to
the
village
where
they
could
help
somebody
he
need
other
men
to
help
him
get
things
back
in
shape
she
could
help
the
other
women
take
care
of
the
needy
and
still
he
hung
back
ashamed
of
his
nakedness
she
scolded
him
then
pointed
out
that
if
everybody
was
naked
their
being
naked
too
likely
to
start
up
a
passel
of
gossip
he
gave
in
to
her
scolding
because
she
was
right
and
came
out
from
behind
his
tree
it
seemed
more
than
passing
strange
to
be
walking
down
that
slope
naked
in
plain
sight
of
everybody
thing
that
helped
was
that
nobody
seemed
of
a
mind
to
stop
and
stare
at
them
everybody
had
his
mind
on
his
own
problems
and
then
a
funny
thing
happened
maybe
jed
reasoned
it
was
seeing
that
everybody
else
was
naked
too
anyway
the
disappeared
all
of
a
sudden
and
they
did
think
any
more
about
it
not
right
then
anyhow
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
foot
of
their
hill
and
into
the
crowd
of
people
he
forgot
all
about
it
there
was
plenty
of
other
things
to
think
about
martha
pitched
right
in
the
way
he
ought
to
have
done
she
was
the
one
who
thought
of
giving
the
men
something
to
do
get
them
over
their
hysterics
why
do
some
of
you
men
get
a
fire
going
she
called
out
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
something
hot
to
drink
is
what
we
need
most
hot
water
in
case
anybody
is
hurt
of
course
she
was
thinking
straight
not
entirely
they
did
have
a
pot
to
heat
water
in
or
maybe
she
was
because
right
away
he
heard
her
asking
other
women
if
any
of
them
knew
where
there
might
be
some
dried
gourds
he
remembered
then
an
old
pioneer
trick
cutting
open
a
gourd
scooping
out
the
seed
filling
it
with
water
dropping
hot
stones
into
it
until
it
boiled
indian
style
it
might
seem
funny
to
city
women
always
protected
against
everything
that
martha
was
more
excited
and
helpless
first
place
she
had
her
man
already
and
did
need
to
put
on
such
a
show
second
place
she
was
a
colonist
woman
an
experimental
colonist
woman
trained
all
her
life
to
take
care
of
the
unexpected
and
for
the
experimentals
something
unexpected
was
always
happening
under
her
influence
and
maybe
a
little
under
his
jed
acknowledged
now
that
he
been
set
straight
by
martha
example
everybody
began
to
settle
down
a
little
like
they
would
after
the
first
shock
of
a
fire
or
flood
it
was
all
over
now
it
was
time
to
start
picking
up
the
pieces
rebuilding
only
it
was
all
over
that
when
they
found
out
they
could
build
a
fire
easiest
way
without
matches
is
to
string
a
bow
and
twirl
a
stick
in
a
hole
punched
into
another
stick
next
easiest
way
is
to
find
a
piece
of
flint
strike
two
pieces
together
to
make
sparks
and
hope
one
will
set
a
wad
of
punk
on
fire
if
no
other
way
rubbing
two
dry
sticks
together
will
do
it
if
you
can
rub
them
fast
enough
get
them
hot
enough
to
make
the
powdered
fibers
burst
into
flame
or
if
they
had
some
of
those
quartz
crystals
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
focus
sun
rays
but
they
could
make
a
bow
or
strike
two
stones
together
or
rub
two
sticks
together
it
could
be
done
well
cal
had
seen
for
himself
what
happened
when
it
was
tried
all
the
men
were
trying
it
and
for
a
little
bit
everybody
thought
it
was
only
happening
to
him
that
he
must
have
lost
the
knack
or
something
for
a
little
bit
there
the
men
were
more
worried
about
how
their
wife
would
bring
it
up
for
weeks
or
months
how
he
had
let
the
rest
of
the
men
show
him
up
when
it
came
to
building
a
fire
one
of
the
men
tore
it
then
he
yelled
out
that
somebody
he
could
see
was
watching
him
over
his
shoulder
that
it
was
meant
they
should
have
fire
cal
looked
quickly
at
louie
at
that
point
of
the
story
louie
was
staring
with
mouth
open
at
jed
and
in
his
eyes
was
confirmation
of
that
same
feeling
but
jed
did
notice
the
effect
and
went
on
with
the
telling
everybody
stopped
and
listened
to
the
man
because
they
were
having
the
same
feeling
jed
knew
it
him
too
the
crowd
might
have
panicked
right
there
if
the
man
had
let
it
rest
but
he
started
explaining
it
the
way
a
man
does
and
makes
himself
ridiculous
he
kept
on
yelling
how
the
men
should
listen
to
the
women
that
it
was
in
the
first
garden
of
eden
that
man
had
made
the
mistake
of
listening
to
woman
that
it
was
eve
who
had
egged
adam
into
eating
that
apple
because
a
woman
was
never
satisfied
to
leave
well
enough
alone
and
now
he
said
in
this
new
eden
man
was
being
given
another
chance
if
he
was
smart
if
he
learned
anything
at
all
this
time
he
listen
to
no
woman
somebody
bust
out
laughing
when
he
said
that
and
it
kind
of
eased
the
tension
a
little
a
woman
said
real
disgusted
that
if
the
men
was
too
helpless
to
start
a
little
fire
least
they
could
do
was
scrape
up
some
dry
leaves
because
in
a
few
hours
it
would
get
dark
magic
or
no
magic
watchers
or
no
watchers
night
would
fall
and
she
for
one
liked
a
soft
bed
that
caused
them
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
sure
enough
the
sun
ceti
was
already
half
way
down
the
sky
from
where
it
had
been
at
noon
at
least
the
world
was
turning
and
time
was
moving
that
at
least
about
three
hours
had
passed
in
what
seemed
like
minutes
somebody
else
one
of
the
men
this
time
said
why
did
they
go
a
little
farther
than
scraping
up
some
leaves
why
did
they
get
busy
and
knock
together
some
shelters
in
case
it
rained
during
the
night
the
way
it
often
did
now
any
one
of
them
man
or
woman
ought
to
have
been
able
to
put
up
a
small
shelter
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
about
it
even
without
no
tools
break
off
a
limb
or
take
a
sharp
stone
dig
holes
in
the
ground
with
it
take
straight
saplings
trim
them
stick
them
upright
in
the
ground
tamp
in
the
dirt
good
and
hard
lash
them
together
with
vines
lash
other
poles
together
to
make
the
frame
of
the
roof
lift
that
onto
the
poles
and
lash
them
all
together
with
braces
thatch
it
with
grass
and
there
you
were
but
there
they
were
they
could
do
it
things
just
would
behave
they
dug
a
hole
and
it
filled
right
up
again
they
could
cut
down
a
sapling
because
the
sharp
stone
the
only
tool
they
had
would
fly
out
of
their
hands
they
even
tried
lashing
some
saplings
together
where
they
grew
and
the
saplings
were
like
things
alive
they
would
be
bound
the
vines
slithered
out
of
their
hands
and
dropped
to
the
ground
and
the
saplings
sprang
up
again
straight
not
only
that
they
could
scrape
together
some
leaves
into
a
pile
all
right
but
when
anybody
tried
to
lie
down
in
them
the
leaves
would
scatter
as
if
blown
by
a
wind
only
there
was
any
wind
some
of
the
women
got
pretty
disgusted
with
their
menfolks
they
tried
it
themselves
and
the
same
things
happened
after
that
they
was
a
little
more
forgiving
a
couple
more
hours
had
passed
while
they
were
trying
that
the
sun
got
low
people
began
to
realize
they
were
getting
hungry
and
they
began
to
realize
there
was
any
way
to
cook
supper
now
there
was
any
real
hardship
not
physical
nobody
been
hurt
shook
up
a
little
scared
for
sure
but
not
hurt
the
river
was
still
flowing
good
clean
water
all
they
had
to
do
was
go
down
to
the
river
bank
and
cup
the
water
in
their
hands
lift
it
to
their
lips
or
even
better
lie
down
on
the
bank
and
lower
their
faces
into
the
water
they
could
do
that
it
helped
a
little
to
know
they
could
the
wild
bushes
and
trees
all
around
had
plenty
of
fruit
and
nuts
to
eat
one
thing
you
could
say
for
eden
the
fruit
did
seem
to
depend
on
seasons
there
was
always
something
ripe
and
plenty
of
it
the
people
wandered
off
from
the
village
site
then
to
forage
their
supper
for
all
the
world
like
animals
grazing
in
a
pasture
they
sort
of
hung
together
in
herds
glad
to
be
together
then
by
dark
they
all
came
back
and
sat
around
in
a
circle
the
way
people
in
the
wilds
sit
around
a
campfire
it
seemed
funny
without
a
campfire
the
darker
it
got
the
funnier
it
felt
the
more
you
thought
about
it
the
stranger
it
got
the
excitement
had
begun
to
wear
off
and
people
were
starting
to
think
a
little
it
got
stranger
and
stranger
in
the
dusk
you
could
see
the
same
thought
in
all
the
gleaming
eyes
they
could
have
fire
maybe
the
strangest
thing
of
all
nobody
was
trying
to
explain
what
had
happened
now
you
take
mankind
he
always
right
in
there
with
an
explanation
for
everything
maybe
it
not
the
right
one
maybe
looking
back
it
a
silly
one
but
at
the
time
he
believes
it
and
that
a
comfort
but
this
was
like
being
in
a
dream
knowing
it
a
dream
knowing
it
ca
happen
this
way
and
so
it
does
have
to
be
explained
and
yet
is
that
the
worst
part
of
a
bad
dream
no
explanation
for
happening
in
it
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
either
somebody
said
it
being
dark
and
all
they
should
get
some
sleep
somebody
mentioned
being
thankful
there
were
any
children
that
was
one
of
the
hardships
of
being
an
experimental
colonist
you
have
children
would
be
right
to
expose
children
to
hardships
have
to
suffer
helpless
only
here
the
way
kids
were
he
would
have
been
surprised
if
kids
would
have
taken
to
it
a
lot
easier
than
the
grown
folks
the
people
sort
of
bedded
down
all
together
the
way
a
herd
of
animals
take
shelter
each
even
in
its
sleep
taking
comfort
from
the
presence
and
protection
of
the
others
they
bedded
around
on
the
ground
making
themselves
comfortable
as
possible
one
thing
you
could
say
experimental
colonists
might
not
be
long
on
brains
the
way
scientists
are
but
they
were
picked
for
that
they
were
picked
for
endurance
and
the
brainy
will
often
crack
up
under
a
strain
that
the
enduring
kind
hardly
notices
far
as
endurance
went
physical
this
was
bad
up
through
the
leaves
and
in
between
the
trees
the
stars
were
as
bright
as
ever
brighter
because
there
was
no
fire
to
dim
their
glow
they
could
see
earth
of
course
but
everybody
knew
right
where
to
look
for
sol
there
it
was
a
tiny
little
spot
of
light
in
its
constellation
it
was
still
there
somebody
said
into
the
darkness
that
it
was
only
two
more
days
until
the
regular
monthly
communication
with
earth
was
due
that
as
soon
as
did
hear
from
them
there
be
a
rescue
party
out
here
in
nothing
flat
so
at
worst
it
meant
living
this
way
only
five
or
six
more
days
that
made
everybody
feel
better
it
was
a
comforting
thing
to
look
up
through
the
leaves
to
see
sol
in
the
sky
to
know
they
forgotten
back
home
that
on
earth
people
would
soon
be
buzzing
around
like
a
disturbed
hive
of
hornets
with
stingers
cocked
and
ready
as
soon
as
the
message
did
get
through
yep
somebody
said
just
like
the
museum
collection
of
western
movies
where
the
cavalry
always
got
there
in
time
at
least
they
being
attacked
by
no
indians
somebody
said
or
were
they
maybe
everybody
asked
that
to
themselves
but
nobody
said
it
most
everybody
got
some
sleep
no
one
really
suffered
any
discomfort
just
showed
them
how
soft
they
were
getting
with
easy
living
considering
everything
they
were
coming
along
just
fine
and
in
a
few
days
everything
would
be
all
right
again
they
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
even
if
there
was
some
equivalent
to
the
indians
attacking
them
rescue
would
soon
be
here
and
they
would
be
safe
because
man
always
wins
most
people
were
wide
awake
by
dawn
some
had
slept
in
little
bits
waking
often
enough
to
keep
a
sense
of
continuity
others
those
who
slept
better
awoke
with
a
start
looked
around
themselves
wildly
realized
they
were
lying
out
in
the
open
plumb
naked
in
front
of
other
people
maybe
wondered
for
an
instant
what
kind
of
party
they
been
to
the
night
before
and
nearly
bolted
in
panic
before
they
remembered
most
everyone
felt
sort
of
surprised
that
things
were
back
to
normal
with
yesterday
being
something
soonest
forgot
soonest
mended
it
takes
time
for
folks
to
realize
things
not
having
a
hot
drink
for
breakfast
was
another
little
hardship
a
reminder
of
how
soft
they
got
but
nobody
complained
seemed
like
everybody
had
woke
with
a
determination
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
help
one
another
do
the
same
everybody
was
pitching
in
together
to
make
the
best
of
things
once
they
bit
into
the
cool
fruit
on
the
trees
around
them
even
not
having
a
hot
drink
to
start
the
day
did
seem
to
matter
some
of
the
women
got
together
and
decided
it
would
help
things
get
back
to
normal
if
the
people
covered
their
nakedness
or
least
parts
of
it
it
might
be
all
right
just
among
themselves
they
said
because
everybody
was
in
the
same
fix
and
knew
what
happened
but
how
would
they
feel
when
the
rescue
ship
landed
and
they
had
to
walk
out
in
front
of
strange
men
with
nothing
on
they
picked
some
big
green
leaves
without
any
trouble
but
when
they
strove
to
pin
them
together
with
thorns
the
thorns
just
slipped
out
and
fell
to
the
ground
then
they
tried
sewing
the
leaves
together
with
bindweed
same
thing
the
bindweed
slithered
out
and
fell
to
the
ground
one
woman
figured
to
stick
some
leaves
together
with
thick
mud
from
the
river
and
paste
them
with
more
mud
on
her
body
it
would
stick
peeled
right
off
like
she
was
oiled
one
man
said
he
could
do
it
without
leaves
just
cover
himself
with
mud
he
lay
down
in
a
muddy
pool
and
got
himself
covered
with
wet
clay
he
was
a
sight
all
at
once
he
looked
vulgar
obscene
and
nobody
had
before
that
did
it
somebody
said
they
were
humans
not
pigs
and
if
the
men
on
the
rescue
ship
had
never
seen
a
naked
body
before
it
was
time
they
did
what
was
so
wrong
about
the
human
body
anyhow
they
made
the
muddy
man
go
bathe
himself
in
the
river
and
gave
up
trying
to
cover
themselves
all
at
once
the
desire
to
cover
themselves
was
a
nasty
kind
of
thinking
something
to
be
ashamed
of
midmorning
somebody
got
to
wondering
if
the
ten
colonists
who
broken
off
from
the
main
colony
and
moved
across
the
ridge
were
all
right
soon
as
he
reminded
them
everybody
began
to
laugh
what
fools
all
been
showed
you
how
a
bit
of
trouble
could
keep
a
man
from
thinking
straight
here
they
been
eating
and
sleeping
like
animals
when
all
the
while
just
across
the
ridge
there
be
houses
and
beds
fires
and
clothes
sure
those
folks
might
differ
in
some
opinions
but
humans
always
stood
ready
to
help
one
another
in
distress
differences
forgotten
in
a
body
they
started
for
the
ridge
everybody
knew
just
where
the
dissidents
had
built
their
homes
but
when
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
there
were
no
houses
there
nothing
but
virgin
woods
same
as
this
side
that
shook
them
up
they
been
so
sure
maybe
it
was
the
jolt
of
that
maybe
it
was
a
measure
that
we
still
were
thinking
straight
something
they
did
go
on
down
and
join
forces
nobody
thought
of
it
somehow
they
went
back
down
and
congregated
around
where
the
village
had
been
maybe
it
was
the
beginning
of
something
that
would
come
later
something
cal
would
see
for
himself
that
they
were
already
not
thinking
the
way
humans
do
thinking
and
behaving
more
the
way
dumb
animals
do
nothing
else
worth
mentioning
happened
that
day
nor
the
next
in
some
ways
it
was
still
like
a
dream
the
way
people
were
just
accepting
things
without
question
maybe
without
curiosity
jed
remembered
one
time
an
e
had
said
there
was
a
wider
gap
between
the
thinking
man
and
the
average
man
than
there
was
between
that
average
man
and
the
ape
he
resented
it
at
the
time
of
course
but
now
he
thought
of
it
again
and
began
to
realize
what
the
e
had
meant
two
or
three
people
commented
on
how
easy
it
was
to
go
back
to
nature
wondered
why
they
had
all
done
it
before
how
stupid
it
was
for
man
to
knock
himself
out
chasing
all
over
the
universe
undergoing
such
hardships
when
all
a
man
could
ever
want
was
right
here
jed
tried
to
put
down
this
kind
of
talk
when
it
came
up
he
reminded
them
it
was
lotus
land
thinking
and
would
be
the
ruination
of
a
prime
bunch
of
colonists
he
reminded
them
they
been
through
hardships
worse
than
this
and
had
ought
to
keep
their
wits
about
them
funny
thing
though
he
could
get
very
excited
about
it
just
did
it
because
it
was
his
duty
maybe
not
even
that
strong
maybe
because
once
upon
a
time
long
ago
hardly
remembered
it
had
been
his
duty
it
was
the
next
day
that
things
got
real
rough
somebody
in
a
moment
said
they
could
be
sure
when
the
rescue
ship
would
get
here
that
when
the
rescuers
came
and
see
any
village
they
would
know
what
to
think
maybe
they
just
go
away
shows
we
were
thinking
so
straight
after
all
to
believe
that
you
go
away
just
because
you
did
find
our
village
anyhow
had
we
ought
to
work
out
some
kind
of
a
message
maybe
scrape
some
kind
of
a
message
on
the
ground
they
decided
the
smooth
sand
above
the
tide
line
down
on
the
sea
shore
was
the
best
place
for
it
nobody
had
anything
else
to
do
so
the
whole
colony
all
forty
of
them
walked
the
couple
of
miles
down
to
the
seashore
they
picked
out
a
nice
stretch
of
white
sand
and
with
a
broken
piece
of
driftwood
they
started
to
scratch
a
message
just
a
big
sos
the
driftwood
wriggled
out
of
their
hands
like
a
snake
nobody
could
hold
it
several
men
tried
together
made
no
difference
somebody
started
scooping
out
a
furrow
with
his
hands
the
furrow
closed
up
and
smoothed
out
right
behind
him
somebody
tried
piling
up
sand
first
in
letters
then
in
code
signals
made
no
difference
sand
smoothed
right
out
again
then
somebody
got
a
bright
idea
all
right
he
said
did
need
to
use
a
stick
or
scoop
out
a
furrow
or
pile
up
the
sand
they
had
their
bare
feet
did
they
they
could
tromp
out
the
letters
that
way
footprints
close
together
would
be
as
good
as
a
furrow
that
when
it
happened
jed
tried
it
himself
and
his
footprints
disappeared
they
just
there
everybody
looked
behind
himself
where
he
been
walking
nobody
was
leaving
any
footprints
that
when
they
bolted
in
panic
jed
looked
quickly
at
cal
when
he
told
him
how
the
colonists
had
spooked
bolted
in
panic
as
if
he
expected
disbelief
maybe
that
seems
funny
to
you
he
commented
after
taking
so
much
we
spook
like
crazy
animals
and
hightail
for
the
woods
over
not
making
footprints
pretty
fundamental
thing
cal
said
with
a

animals
are
aware
of
spoor
long
before
they
are
aware
of
tools
it
hit
deep
down
into
fundamental
being
a
thing
like
that
jed
looked
relieved
hussein
and
van
tassel
exchanged
glances
as
if
confirming
their
belief
that
an
e
would
understand
their
problems
cal
appreciated
the
confidence
expressed
in
that
glance
but
did
not
feel
it
was
justified
it
was
now
pretty
obvious
that
this
was
some
alien
system
never
before
encountered
by
man
but
how
to
get
hold
of
it
how
to
reconcile
with
it
coexist
with
it
never
before
encountered
by
man
what
if
the
myths
of
early
man
be
true
and
too
authentic
the
legends
of
his
being
a
pawn
to
the
will
of
the
gods
could
there
have
been
some
factual
basis
for
the
gods
and
not
as
was
supposed
rationalizations
dreamed
up
by
man
to
account
for
the
control
of
phenomena
at
a
level
beyond
his
own
power
to
control
it
been
bad
since
then
jed
continued
seems
like
once
they
got
the
wind
up
the
whole
thing
hit
them
all
over
again
like
cattle
in
a
stampede
they
did
have
a
lick
of
sense
they
did
even
stay
together
they
scattered
in
all
directions
hid
out
in
the
bushes
from
each
other
you
could
hunt
for
call
for
yell
your
lungs
out
you
could
pass
within
ten
feet
of
one
of
callin
pleadin
and
they
say
a
word
just
stand
there
and
watch
you
like
a
hunted
animal
not
even
breathin
lest
you
discover
them
after
a
couple
of
days
some
of
us
kind
of
pulled
ourselves
together
me
and
martha
ahmed
and
dirk
here
maybe
a
dozen
of
us
now
have
got
together
again
funny
thing
though
even
so
all
we
want
is
to
hide
ca
get
over
hidin
somehow
that
why
you
did
see
us
from
the
air
we
was
hidin
from
you
martha
couple
other
womenfolks
they
practically
had
to
push
us
out
of
the
woods
to
come
greet
you
lead
you
to
us
they
would
come
themselves
being
naked
and
all
they
told
us
first
thing
was
to
get
some
clothes
for
them
from
the
ship
we
was
countin
on
the
arrival
of
your
ship
to
bring
the
rest
of
the
colonists
back
to
their
senses
some
ai
been
found
yet
not
since
the
footprint
thing
if
they
were
watchin
you
from
hidin
places
if
they
also
saw
your
ship
disappear
well
now
i
just
do
know
there
be
another
ship
from
earth
cal
said
in
a
matter
of
fifteen
or
twenty
hours
at
most
we
were
communicating
at
the
time
they
know
we
did
cut
out
through
choice
yes
tom
lynwood
confirmed
as
i
remember
i
got
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
they
know
something
was
wrong
there
another
ship
out
there
right
now
cal
added
not
an
ship
but
one
that
would
have
seen
what
happened
we
not
count
on
anything
from
them
but
an
ship
will
be
here
soon
probably
with
an
e
on
board
mcginnis
do
know
what
good
it
would
do
jed
said
despondently
that
ship
might
disappear
too
soon
as
it
landed
and
the
next
and
the
next
i
do
plan
to
let
it
land
cal
told
them
you
notice
nothing
happened
to
us
until
we
touched
ground
i
find
a
way
to
talk
to
the
ship
keep
it
from
landing
until
we
got
a
line
on
whatever
this
is
you
figger
to
solve
this
one
jed
asked
curiously
unbelieving
i
going
to
try
cal
said
with
more
confidence
than
he
felt
what
i
here
for
maybe
i
ca
solve
it
but
i
can
try
i
do
know
how
you
going
to
start
dirk
spoke
up
we
just
like
animals
here
we
ca
use
tools
but
animals
do
use
tools
cal
answered
after
a
moment
materials
anyway
birds
build
nests
using
sticks
grass
clay
monkeys
and
apes
throw
sticks
and
stones
even
insects
use
materials
basic
difference
between
man
and
the
rest
is
that
man
gives
special
shapes
to
tools
where
mainly
the
rest
use
whatever
falls
to
hand
but
all
higher
organized
protoplasmic
life
uses
tools
in
one
form
or
another
we
ai
allowed
to
jed
said
emphatically
not
even
what
at
hand
somebody
or
somethin
is
bound
and
determined
we
ai
goin
to
at
that
moment
cal
felt
close
to
a
solution
or
at
least
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
problem
which
is
the
first
step
toward
solution
but
like
the
specter
seen
in
twilight
from
the
corner
of
the
eye
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
focus
on
the
problem
the
concept
disappeared
something
about
protoplasmic
life
using
materials
life
could
there
be
and
still
meet
the
definitions
of
what
constitute
life
as
compared
with
our
evolution
from
its
earliest
beginning
finding
some
other
approach
to
the
manipulation
of
the
physical
universe
a
totally
alien
kind
of
science
come
to
think
of
it
the
use
of
material
to
affect
other
material
was
a
cumbersome
indirect
awkward
way
of
going
about
it
as
compared
with
compared
with
what
the
concept
would
not
yet
allow
him
full
focus
upon
it
he
filed
it
away
for
future
contemplation
he
saw
dawkins
and
the
other
colonists
looking
at
him
defiantly
as
if
interpreting
his
silence
to
be
doubt
of
their
veracity
about
the
taboo
on
tools
their
eyes
challenged
him
to
disbelieve
them
to
find
out
for
himself
other
than
the
feeling
of
being
watched
he
said
carefully
have
you
had
any
sign
any
other
evidence
or
indication
of
somebody
or
something
i
know
about
the
feeling
because
i
feel
it
too
and
very
strongly
right
now
but
any
specific
evidence
jed
dawkins
looked
relieved
at
the
confession
everything
the
evidence
everything
that
happened
what
more
evidence
would
you
want
he
said
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
in
favor
of
something
or
some
kind
of
intelligence
cal
said
slowly
is
that
nobody
been
hurt
all
natural
law
has
been
canceled
we
still
have
light
radiation
heat
radiation
gravity
water
still
flows
the
planet
still
turns
trees
still
grow
and
fruit
still
ripens
we
can
talk
and
be
understood
using
our
tongues
and
minds
as
tools
we
can
still
eat
and
drink
we
can
still
know
this
is
no
chaotic
system
that
defies
all
natural
law
this
is
a
deliberate
manipulation
of
some
natural
laws
to
get
a
result
man
manipulates
natural
laws
by
the
use
of
tools
and
materials
but
he
does
suspend
them
here
apparently
without
tools
at
least
tools
we
can
perceive
natural
law
is
manipulated
but
not
suspended
when
the
village
disappeared
no
one
was
hurt
a
lot
of
people
were
caught
in
awkward
positions
and
fell
some
of
them
several
feet
there
should
have
been
at
least
a
few
broken
bones
pulled
ligaments
there
were
our
ship
landed
safely
we
were
a
long
time
in
the
atmosphere
of
eden
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
on
the
ground
we
were
still
using
tools
of
a
high
order
it
was
only
when
danger
of
real
harm
to
us
was
past
that
the
ship
disappeared
i
reckon
it
comfortin
to
know
we
ai
meant
to
be
hurt
jed
said
and
looked
at
his
two
companions
i
guess
it
is
he
repeated
doubtfully
maybe
it
ai
something
as
nice
and
familiar
as
a
cyclone
or
a
den
of
rattlesnakes
something
you
could
understand
but
you
got
to
admit
we
ai
been
hurt
yet
it
was
as
if
he
were
arguing
the
point
with
his
companions
something
i
been
noting
jed
ahmed
spoke
up
a
discrepancy
of
a
sort
that
has
me
puzzled
sun
reckoning
we
been
able
to
keep
our
minds
on
this
subject
for
over
two
hours
now
as
if
whatever
this
is
manipulating
natural
laws
can
also
manipulate
the
way
our
minds
work
yeah
jed
admitted
slowly
his
face
thoughtful
he
turned
to
cal
like
i
said
at
the
start
our
minds
have
sort
of
wandered
of
late
start
to
do
something
and
first
thing
we
doin
something
else
ca
keep
our
minds
on
one
thing
very
long
like
animals
that
might
be
no
more
than
the
aftermath
of
deep
shock
cal
said
it
for
a
purpose
startled
at
the
outburst
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
louie
it
for
a
purpose
louie
repeated
in
a
kind
of
rapture
they
want
us
to
understand
we
are
being
watched
over
cared
for
that
colonist
you
all
laughed
at
was
right
this
is
the
first
garden
of
eden
where
man
lived
in
complete
innocence
now
man
has
been
returned
to
it
to
live
again
in
complete
innocence
you
do
not
think
straight
because
there
is
no
reason
you
will
be
cared
for
woe
unto
him
who
seeks
to
despoil
it
again
by
seeking
vain
knowledge
his
eyes
were
wild
his
face
contorted
with
a
mixture
of
exaltation
and
condemnation
shut
up
louie
tom
said
in
a
low
firm
voice
we
understand
jed
said
tolerantly
some
of
the
colonists
are
the
same
way
he
got
plenty
of
company
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
throughout
the
following
cal
and
tom
worked
with
jed
in
trying
to
round
up
the
colonists
get
them
living
together
again
by
agreement
ahmed
and
dirk
stayed
with
the
small
band
of
colonists
that
had
overcome
their
fears
enough
to
mingle
together
again
louie
frankly
deserted
his
shipmates
and
spent
all
his
time
with
the
colonists
frank
as
if
reverting
to
his
childhood
farming
days
occupied
himself
with
trying
to
round
up
the
stock
he
tried
to
keep
the
cows
separated
from
their
calves
so
the
colonists
would
have
milk
to
drink
but
without
ropes
or
corrals
it
was
hopeless
he
finally
gave
up
his
attempt
to
husband
the
stock
and
he
too
seemed
content
then
to
mingle
with
the
colonists
the
marked
change
in
louie
could
not
be
ignored
for
he
was
not
idling
away
his
time
in
lazy
feeding
and
sleeping
he
had
dropped
his
lifelong
pose
of
superficial
complaint
that
the
fates
always
gave
him
the
dirty
end
of
the
stick
and
now
he
spent
his
time
preaching
to
the
little
band
of
colonists
or
wandering
through
the
forests
and
undergrowth
calling
praying
comforting
cal
felt
no
condemnation
for
him
he
was
not
the
first
man
seemingly
dedicated
to
science
who
confronted
with
mysteries
beyond
his
power
to
comprehend
reverted
to
childlike
superstitious
awe
for
an
explanation
in
the
face
of
mystery
or
catastrophe
it
takes
a
faith
beyond
the
capacity
of
most
to
continue
believing
that
the
universe
has
a
rational
order
to
its
laws
that
can
be
comprehended
if
man
persists
it
is
temptingly
easy
for
man
to
revert
back
to
the
irresponsibility
of
childhood
assuming
that
the
control
of
phenomena
is
in
the
hands
of
those
stronger
wiser
than
he
it
takes
a
strength
in
the
face
of
this
temptation
to
go
on
believing
that
man
know
that
it
is
not
morally
wrong
for
him
to
know
no
blame
then
for
louie
tom
was
torn
in
his
loyalties
he
frequently
remembered
that
away
from
the
crew
become
the
e
attendants
and
that
their
first
duty
is
always
to
the
but
separation
from
the
other
two
men
of
his
crew
was
like
the
loss
of
a
part
of
himself
to
these
also
he
had
a
duty
he
tried
to
solve
his
problem
by
alternating
his
time
spending
part
of
it
with
cal
the
remainder
with
his
crew
cal
and
jed
made
a
trip
the
following
morning
across
the
ridge
and
found
the
dissident
group
huddled
together
in
abject
terror
they
had
seen
the
ship
coming
down
through
the
atmosphere
and
all
together
they
had
climbed
the
ridge
where
one
of
their
scouts
had
recently
gone
to
watch
the
ship
landing
and
its
disappearance
once
they
were
found
it
took
little
persuasion
to
convince
them
they
should
return
to
the
other
colonists
that
differences
of
opinion
meant
nothing
now
as
against
the
need
of
human
beings
to
cling
together
in
the
face
of
catastrophe
but
they
too
were
having
trouble
thinking
in
a
straight
line
and
even
though
they
first
appeared
eager
to
join
the
other
colonists
it
took
some
doing
to
keep
them
all
together
and
moving
forward
to
cross
the
ridge
to
come
down
the
other
side
to
assemble
again
at
the
site
of
the
village
with
the
others
and
yet
within
minutes
neither
band
seemed
to
remember
that
they
had
ever
been
separated
by
the
time
they
had
returned
it
was
apparent
that
louie
was
succeeding
where
jed
had
failed
in
finding
the
colonists
in
the
few
hours
that
had
elapsed
the
nucleus
had
tripled
in
size
louie
wandering
through
the
brush
calling
pleading
with
them
to
follow
him
promising
there
was
no
danger
if
they
would
allow
him
to
watch
over
them
intercede
for
them
with
those
who
had
caused
all
this
had
indeed
coaxed
them
from
their
hiding
places
calmed
their
fears
and
still
through
the
day
he
toiled
finding
them
bringing
them
back
into
the
fold
one
and
two
and
three
at
a
time
until
at
last
by
count
all
were
there
no
more
missing
and
yet
in
spite
of
his
success
there
was
a
kind
of
hurt
and
disappointment
in
louie
eyes
for
once
back
they
not
only
forgot
their
fears
they
seemed
also
to
forget
him
they
coalesced
into
a
placid
herd
without
memory
of
their
panic
without
memory
of
the
shepherd
who
had
found
the
lost
sheep
and
returned
them
to
the
fold
they
wandered
among
the
trees
and
bushes
picking
fruit
and
nuts
eating
leaves
and
stems
and
flowers
of
plants
they
wandered
down
to
the
river
to
lie
prone
on
the
sand
dip
their
faces
into
the
clear
cold
water
to
drink
during
the
heat
of
the
day
they
bathed
in
the
river
and
as
they
lay
on
white
sand
or
grassy
slopes
to
dry
they
slept
contentedly
the
phenomenon
was
not
as
startling
to
cal
as
it
might
have
seemed
to
others
on
earth
gradually
learned
through
trial
and
error
experimental
colonists
were
not
picked
for
their
jobs
because
of
flexible
incisive
or
brilliant
minds
quite
the
contrary
the
basic
test
of
a
successful
colonist
was
endurance
the
endurance
of
hardship
privation
the
stoic
indifference
to
conditions
of
discomfort
monotony
pain
uncleanliness
immodesty
conditions
which
would
send
a
more
imaginative
or
sensitive
temperament
into
a
syndrome
of
failure
they
were
the
kind
of
men
and
women
who
on
earth
in
an
earlier
time
had
been
able
to
endure
the
harshness
of
the
sea
of
arctic
cold
jungle
disease
desert
heat
to
make
those
first
steps
in
taming
a
hostile
environment
so
that
men
with
less
endurance
but
with
more
delicately
poised
and
sensitive
minds
following
them
might
then
endure
it
was
characteristic
of
such
men
and
women
even
under
earth
conditions
that
they
seldom
questioned
their
reasons
for
these
things
they
simply
went
and
endured
and
tamed
even
on
earth
when
the
taming
had
been
done
they
moved
on
this
was
the
stuff
of
the
experimental
colonist
now
here
that
temperament
still
persisted
they
had
fled
in
panic
but
now
they
had
returned
to
their
original
purpose
to
endure
it
was
enough
louie
was
to
learn
in
disappointment
that
failure
to
be
curious
about
scientific
reasoning
was
usually
accompanied
by
an
equal
failure
to
be
curious
about
philosophical
implications
they
listened
idly
to
his
exhortations
but
their
eyes
did
not
light
with
fire
nor
cloud
with
doubt
they
simply
wandered
away
after
a
time
and
ate
or
slept
in
the
evening
of
that
second
day
cal
sat
with
tom
and
jed
down
by
the
bank
of
the
river
where
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
beginning
to
shine
they
were
talking
quietly
of
home
of
eden
of
the
colonists
who
more
and
more
seemed
to
take
on
the
character
of
a
contented
herd
of
animals
so
far
there
had
been
no
attempt
of
the
old
males
to
drive
the
young
ones
out
of
the
herd
destroy
them
but
that
might
come
in
time
as
surely
as
the
old
males
on
earth
by
tacit
agreement
on
both
sides
were
always
able
to
work
up
a
war
for
the
purpose
of
weeding
out
and
destroying
lusty
young
male
competition
they
were
talking
of
the
curious
fact
that
all
three
of
them
seemed
able
to
continue
thinking
in
a
straight
line
hold
their
minds
to
a
subject
while
all
the
rest
grew
more
vague
less
retentive
more
content
to
live
from
moment
to
moment
without
concern
for
past
or
future
except
louie
he
too
seemed
able
to
hold
his
thinking
in
a
straight
line
one
tangential
to
theirs
he
seemed
in
these
hours
to
have
turned
wholly
mystical
to
a
stronger
belief
that
they
were
being
watched
and
cared
for
by
some
higher
power
and
that
this
was
for
a
purpose
yet
not
so
tangential
for
cal
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
although
his
interpretation
differed
i
ca
doubt
that
there
is
an
intelligent
direction
of
this
peculiar
system
he
said
to
tom
and
jed
but
i
must
doubt
it
is
supernatural
in
the
way
louie
interprets
anything
appears
to
be
magic
when
we
do
understand
how
it
happens
and
becomes
science
when
we
do
he
paused
and
looked
at
his
companions
faces
in
the
starshine
they
were
quiet
reposed
listening
ever
since
man
got
up
off
the
bottom
of
his
ocean
of
air
he
said
and
out
into
space
we
been
prepared
to
run
into
some
form
of
intelligence
which
does
behave
the
way
we
do
not
prepared
to
do
anything
about
it
you
understand
he
said
with
a
shrug
just
theoretically
prepared
that
it
might
happen
it
was
a
possibility
now
it
does
seem
to
have
happened
e
mcginnis
asked
me
before
i
left
earth
if
i
thought
eden
was
an
alluring
trap
especially
baited
to
catch
some
human
beings
it
begins
to
appear
that
it
is
i
caught
many
a
wild
animal
in
my
day
jed
said
slowly
thoughtfully
i
pinned
up
in
cages
watched
how
they
behaved
i
guess
scientists
do
that
all
the
time
do
want
to
hurt
fact
make
as
comfortable
as
they
can
just
want
to
know
about
sometimes
after
i
watched
them
awhile
i
turn
aloose
and
watch
scoot
back
to
their
natural
world
that
could
happen
to
us
sometimes
they
die
and
i
would
know
why
that
could
happen
some
animals
wo
bear
young
in
captivity
we
ca
because
of
an
operation
maybe
holdin
us
do
know
that
and
might
turn
us
aloose
when
after
a
time
we
do
bear
any
young
he
paused
and
looked
even
more
thoughtful
sometimes
he
added
slowly
after
i
studied
found
out
how
they
would
behave
no
matter
what
i
had
to
kill
because
they
was
too
dangerous
to
let
run
around
among
humans
that
could
happen
i
have
done
much
trapping
tom
said
but
in
zoos
i
watched
animals
in
cages
the
thought
always
came
to
me
that
if
they
could
think
the
way
we
do
they
could
just
open
their
cages
and
walk
away
now
you
take
turkeys
jed
answered
pin
up
with
a
high
fence
they
back
up
take
off
and
fly
over
it
but
pin
with
a
low
fence
and
they
wo
seems
like
they
know
they
have
to
fly
over
a
high
obstruction
but
do
figger
on
it
for
a
low
one
sometimes
they
flutter
up
against
it
or
try
to
push
it
over
but
most
of
the
time
they
just
walk
around
and
around
in
the
yard
lookin
for
an
opening
natural
survival
pattern
cal
commented
in
the
woods
in
their
natural
state
when
they
came
up
against
a
fallen
log
it
took
more
effort
to
lift
their
heavy
bodies
in
flight
over
it
than
it
took
to
walk
around
the
log
it
became
a
fixed
pattern
of
behavior
to
walk
around
it
that
what
they
do
with
a
low
fence
then
jed
said
they
just
keep
tryin
to
walk
around
the
obstruction
not
enough
sense
to
treat
it
like
a
high
fence
because
it
ai
high
see
no
use
tryin
to
tell
high
because
they
know
it
ai
so
they
ca
solve
it
seems
awful
stupid
somehow
a
little
low
fence
all
that
blue
sky
above
and
they
ca
figger
it
out
i
suspect
that
what
happening
to
us
cal
said
we
always
argued
that
wherever
there
is
matter
and
energy
in
the
universe
certain
natural
laws
will
prevail
we
learned
ways
to
take
advantage
of
those
natural
laws
to
do
certain
things
that
will
make
them
work
for
us
instead
of
against
us
we
always
argued
that
for
any
kind
of
intelligence
to
arise
in
the
universe
it
too
would
have
to
become
aware
of
these
natural
laws
that
it
too
would
have
to
do
these
same
certain
things
to
take
advantage
of
those
laws
that
because
the
laws
and
what
to
do
about
them
would
always
be
similar
man
would
have
a
lot
in
common
with
that
other
intelligence
and
a
means
of
communicating
because
of
that
similarity
we
argue
that
whatever
its
evolutionary
physical
shape
this
so
important
as
its
mental
evolution
because
that
mental
evolution
would
follow
the
same
course
as
ours
they
would
be
truly
alien
because
science
would
be
a
common
denominator
now
it
appears
we
could
be
wrong
maybe
our
concept
of
science
is
too
narrow
maybe
we
like
the
turkey
we
become
so
fixed
in
our
pattern
of
solving
a
problem
we
ca
change
ca
back
off
and
take
another
look
see
the
problem
not
as
it
appears
but
as
it
really
is
but
is
that
the
science
of
e
tom
asked
curiously
to
be
able
to
extrapolate
any
system
i
not
criticizing
he
added
hastily
just
asking
i
suspect
even
our
means
of
extrapolation
are
too
limited
too
based
on
the
relationship
of
things
and
forces
to
each
other
too
set
in
the
notion
that
only
physical
tools
can
affect
physical
things
we
may
be
looking
at
a
low
fence
calling
it
a
log
and
therefore
not
able
to
understand
why
we
ca
walk
around
the
obstruction
in
the
usual
manner
he
stopped
and
added
with
a
shrug
stupid
maybe
or
like
the
turkey
the
yard
is
so
big
that
he
never
gets
a
picture
of
it
as
a
whole
enclosure
by
the
time
he
wandered
down
this
side
of
the
fence
forgot
what
he
found
on
the
other
side
never
can
put
the
whole
thing
together
in
his
mind
that
my
trouble
anyhow
so
far
i
not
able
to
put
the
whole
thing
together
see
it
all
as
one
piece
when
i
do
if
i
do
then
maybe
like
a
caged
animal
i
see
how
to
unlock
an
opening
or
maybe
realize
the
only
way
out
is
to
fly
there
beside
the
softly
flowing
river
where
water
was
obeying
natural
law
without
any
trouble
the
three
men
broke
off
their
discussion
when
they
saw
a
bright
flash
high
in
the
sky
above
them
all
three
knew
what
it
meant
another
e
ship
had
arrived
no
doubt
the
ship
would
expect
light
signals
from
the
colonists
in
acknowledgment
of
their
space
flare
if
the
ship
had
come
while
this
portion
of
the
planet
was
still
in
daylight
they
would
have
seen
there
was
no
village
no
ship
no
equipment
for
direct
communication
they
may
even
have
reasoned
there
was
no
means
of
signaling
with
artificial
light
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
them
that
those
on
eden
could
not
build
a
fire
as
if
they
were
present
on
the
ship
themselves
the
three
men
could
anticipate
what
must
be
happening
there
right
now
they
would
be
anxiously
waiting
for
signal
flares
to
light
up
to
spring
up
like
signal
fires
on
a
lonely
island
where
a
marooned
man
has
at
last
sighted
a
ship
on
the
horizon
the
colonists
were
no
longer
hiding
but
were
freely
wandering
in
open
spaces
if
the
ship
had
arrived
before
dusk
they
would
have
seen
the
men
and
women
in
the
viewscopes
if
after
dusk
they
still
might
have
spotted
them
in
the
infrared
viewers
which
picked
up
the
heat
differentials
and
gave
a
fair
approximation
of
shapes
the
men
on
the
ship
would
be
waiting
and
looking
at
their
watches
how
long
they
would
be
asking
does
it
take
those
colonists
that
e
down
there
to
get
a
signal
fire
going
about
five
minutes
passed
and
another
flare
lighted
the
heavens
get
off
the
dime
down
there
it
seemed
to
say
acknowledge
us
cal
took
the
chance
that
they
might
have
an
infrared
viewscope
directly
on
him
and
he
waved
his
arms
above
his
head
but
apparently
they
had
not
spotted
him
for
there
was
no
answering
flare
at
intervals
of
five
minutes
at
first
then
later
cut
to
fifteen
minutes
throughout
the
long
night
the
flares
continued
to
light
the
sky
talk
to
us
the
flares
begged
surely
you
were
expecting
us
surely
you
would
not
all
be
sleeping
so
soundly
that
our
light
could
not
rouse
you
several
times
the
three
men
stood
up
and
waved
their
arms
but
it
brought
no
answer
from
the
ship
in
the
darkness
perhaps
the
equipment
was
good
enough
perhaps
in
the
night
breeze
bushes
and
trees
also
swayed
with
movement
once
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
brush
and
in
the
starlight
they
recognized
the
figure
of
louie
approaching
them
this
has
got
to
stop
he
said
worriedly
as
he
came
up
to
them
that
light
is
an
unnatural
thing
it
will
anger
them
it
is
not
meant
for
the
peace
of
eden
to
be
disturbed
by
any
artificial
thing
and
if
they
should
turn
their
wrath
upon
us
woe
woe
his
face
was
stricken
in
the
light
of
a
new
flare
and
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
to
object
he
left
plunged
back
under
the
trees
to
seek
his
people
be
beside
them
comforting
them
when
disaster
struck
down
after
a
time
the
three
men
gave
up
trying
to
wave
their
acknowledgment
of
the
flares
in
darkness
they
watched
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
tried
to
sleep
the
periodic
flares
continued
to
come
throughout
the
long
night
as
if
now
no
longer
pleading
for
acknowledgment
but
rather
reassuring
men
in
such
deep
distress
that
they
could
not
answer
reassuring
them
that
help
was
at
hand
and
morning
would
come
they
tried
to
sleep
and
although
fitfully
disturbed
by
the
continuing
flares
they
did
sleep
but
at
the
first
hint
of
dawn
cal
awoke
and
aroused
his
two
companions
and
by
the
time
there
was
enough
light
for
the
ship
to
see
clear
detail
upon
the
ground
the
three
men
were
ready
for
a
better
attempt
at
answering
the
ship
signal
they
went
up
to
the
village
site
where
the
colonists
were
sleeping
in
the
way
a
herd
is
bedded
down
together
they
awoke
frank
and
martha
ahmed
and
dirk
and
told
them
of
their
plan
louie
too
awoke
heard
the
plan
and
tried
to
warn
them
against
it
any
attempt
he
said
to
communicate
with
those
not
on
eden
would
surely
increase
the
wrath
of
those
who
wanted
only
the
natural
state
here
a
wrath
still
withheld
because
of
superhuman
mercy
but
which
must
not
be
tried
too
far
in
spite
of
his
warnings
cal
and
those
with
him
got
together
enough
colonists
to
carry
out
his
plan
the
colonists
did
as
they
were
told
but
with
the
attitude
that
it
was
something
amusing
that
there
was
nothing
rather
be
doing
at
the
moment
any
sense
of
urgency
about
communicating
with
home
seemed
to
have
been
washed
from
their
minds
in
a
clear
space
on
the
soft
grass
cal
got
the
colonists
to
sit
or
lie
in
certain
positions
checked
against
tom
knowledge
of
ancient
signal
patterns
those
certain
positions
took
the
shape
of
patterns
three
men
lay
in
a
triangle
next
to
that
six
men
sat
in
a
circle
and
last
three
more
men
lay
in
another
triangle
cal
hoped
someone
on
the
ship
would
be
able
to
read
the
ancient
message
keep
clear
of
me
i
am
maneuvering
with
difficulty
the
signal
had
no
more
than
formed
when
there
was
a
flash
from
the
ship
so
bright
that
it
could
be
seen
in
the
morning
sky
they
had
read
his
signal
and
now
they
began
a
series
of
flashes
of
questions
going
on
down
there
was
the
essence
of
their
questioning
it
was
well
the
ship
had
caught
the
first
signal
for
the
colonists
lost
all
interest
in
the
game
which
had
no
point
they
simply
stood
up
and
wandered
away
in
search
of
their
breakfasts
from
the
trees
and
bushes
louie
who
had
stood
to
one
side
glowering
now
took
charge
of
them
again
and
shepherded
them
to
a
grove
of
trees
where
the
fruit
seemed
especially
large
and
succulent
but
now
that
the
ship
had
spotted
him
cal
could
signal
alone
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
himself
to
move
his
arms
in
semaphore
positions
but
even
as
he
lay
back
he
became
conscious
that
he
too
could
hardly
care
less
with
a
detached
interest
that
amounted
to
amusement
at
such
childish
primitive
things
he
watched
his
arms
spell
out
one
more
message
keep
off
no
mechanical
science
allowed
in
this
system
he
stood
up
then
and
made
a
farewell
gesture
toward
the
ship
at
that
instant
he
felt
strangely
that
he
had
passed
into
another
stage
of
growth
completed
a
task
cut
himself
off
from
an
environment
that
had
held
him
back
what
the
ship
did
in
response
to
his
warnings
no
longer
mattered
if
it
landed
its
personnel
too
would
join
the
colonists
if
it
obeyed
the
request
of
an
e
it
might
circle
there
indefinitely
indefinitely
watching
the
turkeys
circle
inside
their
low
fence
unable
to
aid
them
release
them
he
did
not
particularly
care
what
they
did
they
could
go
on
spluttering
out
their
signals
trying
to
question
him
he
did
even
try
to
read
their
messages
it
did
matter
their
science
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
nothing
to
offer
him
through
it
he
could
not
reach
a
solution
somehow
he
knew
that
already
this
time
the
communications
supervisor
said
with
all
the
firmness
he
could
muster
this
time
there
must
not
be
any
interference
with
communication
there
just
absolutely
must
not
be
well
it
was
my
fault
the
operator
retorted
with
an
exasperation
that
blanketed
prudent
restraint
you
heard
what
e
mcginnis
said
that
they
could
identify
e
gray
and
the
ship
crew
and
many
of
the
colonists
but
that
there
was
no
sign
of
the
ship
that
took
them
there
if
there
was
any
ship
there
could
be
any
communication
it
not
my
fault
i
ca
receive
something
that
was
sent
i
know
i
know
the
supervisor
said
and
then
worried
that
he
may
be
giving
the
appearance
of
backing
down
commanded
savagely
just
watch
it
that
all
he
chewed
violently
at
his
knuckle
and
glared
at
the
operator
just
watch
it
the
operator
mumbled
bitterly
just
watch
it
the
man
says
and
what
will
i
watch
if
the
message
stops
coming
now
now
now
now
the
supervisor
nagged
we
have
no
insubordination
if
you
please
and
upstairs
this
time
more
than
bill
hayes
sector
chief
were
monitoring
the
message
the
top
administrative
brass
of
were
assembled
in
their
big
plush
conference
room
used
for
arriving
at
major
policy
decisions
that
sometimes
affected
the
whole
course
of
progress
and
direction
in
occupying
the
universe
they
sat
in
worried
silence
as
e
mcginnis
reported
the
two
messages
he
had
received
from
junior
e
gray
first
keep
clear
of
me
i
am
maneuvering
with
difficulty
then
keep
off
no
mechanical
science
allowed
in
this
system
they
looked
at
one
another
under
beetled
brows
they
wondered
at
first
privately
and
then
openly
if
that
junior
e
had
blown
his
stack
they
had
looked
at
many
a
problem
finally
solved
by
the
e
but
never
before
had
such
a
ridiculous
situation
come
up
and
right
at
the
time
too
when
the
civil
government
had
decided
to
place
a
curb
on
freedom
of
movement
its
control
over
the
experimental
phases
of
planet
development
the
injunction
to
halt
a
junior
e
from
taking
over
the
eden
problem
fooled
none
of
them
they
knew
that
gunderson
was
concerned
for
those
colonists
out
there
that
he
was
merely
using
the
public
furor
to
advance
his
own
personal
power
they
knew
that
the
police
worked
unremittingly
unceasingly
always
and
ever
to
bring
every
phase
of
human
activity
under
their
control
they
knew
it
was
a
tactic
to
wait
for
the
right
situation
to
arise
so
that
the
lawmakers
could
be
stampeded
into
passing
some
law
which
seemed
only
to
apply
to
this
given
condition
but
in
actuality
broadened
police
powers
over
a
wide
area
of
man
actions
yes
there
was
far
more
at
stake
here
than
the
fate
of
fifty
colonists
in
a
sense
itself
was
the
stake
the
whole
science
of
e
was
at
stake
and
e
mcginnis
had
played
right
into
gunderson
hands
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
e
influence
in
deciding
to
allow
a
junior
to
handle
the
problem
in
the
first
place
it
was
he
who
was
standing
off
from
the
planet
not
landing
and
taking
over
things
as
he
should
there
was
obviously
no
danger
by
his
own
report
the
people
on
eden
were
in
good
health
and
from
their
apparent
actions
not
even
distressed
this
message
about
no
mechanical
science
being
allowed
for
example
did
the
junior
mean
the
colonists
would
allow
it
must
mean
that
what
else
could
prevent
it
but
when
an
e
a
real
e
took
charge
in
an
experimental
colony
the
colonists
had
nothing
further
to
say
about
the
matter
true
when
the
experimental
period
was
over
and
the
colonists
took
over
a
planet
then
it
came
more
under
civil
control
and
largely
withdrew
with
the
provision
that
it
could
step
back
in
at
any
time
the
problem
seemed
not
to
have
been
solved
after
all
but
while
under
the
test
the
e
was
the
final
word
or
should
be
the
colonists
knew
it
the
e
knew
it
or
should
know
it
obviously
then
it
was
weakness
on
the
part
of
the
junior
if
he
allowed
the
colonists
to
dictate
that
there
could
be
no
mechanical
science
proof
of
his
inability
to
handle
the
job
a
perfect
setup
for
gunderson
they
decided
they
were
forced
to
take
a
strong
hand
with
mcginnis
ordinarily
the
e
was
the
final
word
not
only
with
the
colonists
but
with
the
administration
at
but
maybe
there
were
times
when
he
should
be
yes
definitely
they
should
take
a
hand
after
all
gray
was
still
a
junior
hardly
more
than
a
boy
was
it
right
that
a
mere
boy
could
stop
investigation
by
anyone
except
himself
tell
earth
with
all
its
power
and
might
what
to
do
definitely
there
was
a
time
when
an
exception
to
general
e
policy
should
be
made
definitely
this
was
that
time
if
nothing
else
they
must
take
a
strong
hand
to
prevent
gunderson
from
moving
in
with
his
police
powers
protect
the
e
science
from
gunderson
or
at
least
salvage
what
they
might
their
conference
over
they
asked
for
a
connection
with
mcginnis
we
assume
you
will
land
and
take
charge
e
mcginnis
the
board
chairman
asked
certainly
not
mcginnis
snapped
back
an
e
has
forbidden
it
well
now
the
chairman
argued
and
sweat
began
to
come
out
on
his
forehead
he
only
a
junior
we
have
decided
his
judgment
is
mature
enough
for
this
problem
i
have
every
confidence
in
junior
e
gray
mcginnis
said
acidly
and
every
e
in
the
system
will
back
me
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
have
decided
either
the
science
of
e
means
something
or
it
does
either
we
have
complete
freedom
to
handle
a
problem
or
we
do
let
me
remind
you
gentlemen
this
is
the
first
time
that
laymen
have
decided
the
e
is
a
fool
and
tried
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
do
you
want
to
repeat
past
disasters
if
we
do
land
a
ship
e
mcginnis
the
chairman
was
all
but
pleading
now
gunderson
police
will
we
feel
we
must
land
a
ship
to
take
a
firmer
control
over
the
situation
public
sentiment
demands
it
policy
demands
it
perhaps
the
whole
future
of
e
demands
it
a
new
voice
cut
into
the
communications
hookup
a
feminine
voice
gentlemen
she
said
this
is
linda
gray
i
requested
that
i
be
cut
in
on
any
communication
concerning
my
husband
and
e
mcginnis
made
it
an
order
before
he
left
if
another
ship
does
land
i
must
be
on
it
i
want
to
be
with
my
husband
i
will
not
be
landing
on
eden
linda
e
mcginnis
said
firmly
an
e
has
forbidden
it
that
is
enough
for
any
other
e
in
the
universe
no
other
e
will
land
your
husband
is
all
right
he
is
in
good
health
and
apparently
mentally
sound
at
least
sound
enough
to
warn
us
against
landing
he
must
have
a
reason
we
do
know
yet
what
it
is
now
he
has
stopped
communicating
we
do
know
why
he
must
have
a
reason
for
that
too
it
is
probably
a
sound
reason
e
science
has
been
drilled
into
him
until
it
is
a
part
of
his
every
mind
cell
perhaps
even
every
body
cell
i
assume
he
is
not
communicating
because
we
ca
help
him
because
communicating
with
us
distracts
him
from
solving
the
problem
if
decides
to
send
out
a
ship
on
its
own
and
risk
landing
in
an
unknown
system
against
the
orders
of
two
e
which
will
become
the
combined
orders
of
all
e
in
the
universe
that
is
their
decision
if
you
wish
to
be
on
it
that
is
your
decision
i
am
cutting
off
now
it
will
be
no
accident
that
can
not
connect
with
me
i
cutting
out
because
i
do
want
to
be
distracted
any
further
i
trying
to
think
the
acid
rebuff
of
the
old
e
left
the
administrative
board
hanging
in
a
vacuum
of
indecision
frustration
angry
determination
to
do
something
anything
they
were
caught
between
the
intransigence
of
the
e
fraternity
it
was
their
duty
to
serve
and
from
whom
they
should
be
able
to
expect
help
and
the
obvious
determination
of
gunderson
to
use
this
incident
as
his
means
of
regaining
control
over
the
e
and
for
civil
authority
did
the
stupid
e
see
the
danger
was
it
the
same
danger
that
men
of
science
had
always
faced
the
same
mistake
they
had
always
made
leaving
out
the
human
element
in
a
problem
the
eternal
blind
spot
in
men
of
science
the
average
man
does
give
a
tinker
damn
for
progress
or
knowledge
not
really
he
wants
only
that
he
and
his
shall
be
ascendant
at
the
center
of
things
the
inevitable
the
only
possible
goal
of
the
mind
surely
the
history
of
science
versus
should
have
made
this
evident
long
ago
surely
there
had
been
enough
incidents
in
history
very
well
it
was
up
to
them
to
help
the
e
in
spite
of
himself
if
he
refused
the
see
the
clear
danger
to
his
whole
structure
and
their
own
ascendant
position
at
the
center
of
it
it
was
their
clear
duty
to
protect
him
nonetheless
they
would
send
out
another
ship
a
large
one
a
floating
laboratory
a
miniature
at
least
to
be
there
on
the
scene
to
help
in
any
way
they
could
perhaps
to
counter
the
moves
gunderson
police
might
make
at
least
to
stand
by
at
least
in
the
face
of
all
this
public
clamor
about
eden
to
show
their
concern
the
chairman
of
the
board
rationalized
it
masterfully
without
once
mentioning
that
their
real
concern
was
to
remain
ascendant
at
the
center
of
things
at
all
costs
and
thereby
maintained
the
tradition
of
all
endeavors
gentlemen
he
said
in
summary
we
have
a
grave
responsibility
not
only
to
the
e
structure
but
to
all
mankind
as
well
in
every
system
in
every
rule
there
must
be
provision
for
the
exception
gray
is
only
a
junior
herein
lies
the
weakness
of
our
position
herein
lies
gunderson
strength
his
weapon
for
swaying
the
sentiment
of
the
people
a
junior
e
is
not
mature
enough
to
make
the
decisions
affecting
the
life
or
death
of
fifty
people
more
than
that
perhaps
the
future
progress
of
mankind
may
i
point
out
gentlemen
that
in
a
showdown
if
it
should
become
necessary
for
us
to
land
a
ship
to
rescue
those
colonists
in
spite
of
the
junior
demand
that
we
stay
clear
of
the
planet
we
will
not
be
overriding
the
decision
of
an
e
but
of
a
boy
who
has
not
yet
proved
his
capacity
to
merit
an
we
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
am
forced
to
agree
with
gunderson
on
that
if
we
must
honor
the
command
of
the
junior
e
then
why
not
the
associate
e
why
not
the
student
e
why
not
the
apprentice
student
e
why
not
any
kid
in
the
universe
who
thinks
he
is
extra
smart
the
line
of
demarcation
the
point
at
which
civil
control
over
the
individual
gives
way
to
immunity
from
civil
control
has
never
been
clearly
drawn
we
may
regret
that
the
issue
has
arisen
at
all
but
it
has
arisen
gunderson
purpose
is
clear
he
intends
to
bring
the
e
structure
back
under
civil
control
we
must
salvage
what
we
can
perhaps
if
we
concede
his
control
over
the
juniors
on
down
we
can
maintain
the
immunity
of
the
senior
we
must
work
to
save
at
least
that
much
the
floating
laboratory
which
might
have
to
become
a
rescue
ship
left
six
hours
later
linda
was
on
it
there
was
no
frustration
no
uncertainty
in
gunderson
mind
his
course
was
now
clear
his
observer
ship
had
also
read
the
messages
spelled
out
by
the
placement
of
naked
bodies
on
the
grass
and
in
the
semaphore
wavings
of
the
junior
e
arms
the
photographs
taken
were
all
the
evidence
he
needed
to
prove
the
morals
charges
he
intended
to
bring
it
might
not
be
wise
to
allow
the
total
photographs
to
show
in
the
newspapers
on
television
for
there
were
men
here
and
there
who
might
interpret
the
code
but
enlarged
pictures
of
the
individuals
separated
from
the
total
disporting
themselves
in
lewd
naked
positions
would
do
the
job
clearly
the
police
must
put
a
stop
to
this
he
would
have
every
organization
in
the
universe
dedicated
to
dictating
the
morals
of
others
on
his
side
no
politician
would
have
the
guts
to
stand
up
in
opposition
there
remained
only
one
thing
to
do
go
out
and
get
that
junior
e
place
him
under
arrest
bring
him
back
for
trial
perhaps
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
colonists
off
easy
he
could
easily
show
that
it
was
the
influence
of
the
junior
which
had
made
a
disgusting
orgy
develop
there
on
eden
never
mind
that
they
were
naked
before
the
junior
arrived
the
public
could
always
be
about
the
nature
of
the
evidence
its
order
and
meaning
it
was
an
old
police
prosecution
and
political
trick
to
separate
a
few
items
from
the
total
context
but
still
a
good
one
for
the
public
never
bothered
to
know
the
whole
context
of
anything
an
old
trick
to
fasten
on
phrases
and
slogans
to
fix
an
attitude
in
the
public
mind
for
a
phrase
or
slogan
was
about
all
the
public
was
able
to
master
anyone
who
had
ever
served
on
a
jury
observed
its
deliberations
knew
that
out
of
all
the
welter
of
evidence
only
certain
isolated
statements
or
facts
often
minor
and
insignificant
penetrated
the
juror
mind
and
around
these
bits
he
formed
his
conclusions
any
smart
lawyer
knew
that
and
tried
to
set
up
his
case
accordingly
his
own
course
was
clear
his
orders
to
the
selected
captain
of
his
police
ship
were
equally
clear
proceed

foregoing
the

raised
his
eyebrows
when
he
read
the
final
order
place
a
senior
e
under
arrest
certainly
a
senior
it
was
one
thing
to
allow
these
birds
to
wander
around
free
as
air
to
do
as
they
please
it
was
one
thing
to
let
them
get
away
with
making
such
statements
as
the
police
attitude
toward
the
people
is
the
major
cause
of
crime
it
was
something
else
and

the
e
found
it
out
for
them
to
make
any
overt
move
to
interfere
with
the

in
their
performance
of
duty
personally
he
hoped
the
old
e
would
be
fool
enough
to
resist
it
would
strengthen
his
case
the
police
captain
obeyed
the
first
of
the
orders
without
a
hitch
he
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
he
obeyed
the
second
order
he
ignored
the
command
of
e
mcginnis
received
over
the
ship
communicator
when
they
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
to
stand
clear
of
the
planet
what
policeman
moving
in
to
make
an
arrest
for
an
illegal
act
and
certainly
running
around
stark
naked
posing
in
lewd
and
indecent
postures
in
full
view
of
the
public
was
an
illegal
act
would
pay
any
attention
to
the
request
of
an
onlooker
which
amounted
to
aw
let
alone
copper
there
was
no
communication
at
all
from
the
junior
e
on
the
surface
so
the
third
order
did
not
apply
it
was
in
trying
to
execute
the
fourth
order
that
he
ran
into
trouble
he
passed
inside
the
orbits
of
the
three
other
ships
now
circling
the
planet
the
police
observer
ship
the
e
mcginnis
ship
the
floating
laboratory
he
gave
orders
to
lower
his
ship
into
atmosphere
the
proper
buttons
were
pushed
the
proper
levers
pulled
and
nothing
happened
it
was
as
if
some
invisible
shield
held
him
back
he
could
not
lower
the
ship
into
the
atmosphere
gently
taking
the
normal
precautions
against
crashing
very
well
then
not
so
gently
full
power
and
nothing
happened
they
lowered
not
another
inch
a
thrust
a
thrust
at
tangent
to
the
surface
once
past
whatever
this
barrier
was
they
could
skim
the
surface
and
come
back
to
land
on
the
proper
site
they
backed
the
ship
farther
out
into
space
they
made
their
thrust
with
full
speed
and
momentum
there
was
no
sensation
when
they
hit
the
barrier
but
they
did
not
penetrate
it
it
was
as
if
a
flat
stone
had
been
skipped
across
slick
ice
and
they
shot
back
out
into
space
again
the
tangent
penetration
would
not
do
very
well
then
a
direct
thrust
full
power
straight
down
be
prepared
to
put
braking
forces
into
immediate
power
lest
they
crash
the
ship
at
full
power
against
the
surface
and
again
no
sensation
against
all
natural
laws
of
inertia
they
came
to
a
full
stop
at
the
given
level
outside
the
atmosphere
without
any
feeling
of
jar
or
opposing
pressure
at
all
what
now
gunderson
sir
reluctantly
gunderson
ordered
the
police
captain
to
contact
e
mcginnis
e
science
apparently
had
some
kind
of
shield
which
they
kept
secret
from
the
people
and
would
there
be
a
stink
over
that
one
once
he
released
that
information
contact
e
mcginnis
and
find
out
why
sure
e
mcginnis
cackled
with
derisive
laughter
sure
there
a
shield
i
did
make
it
i
would
know
how
no
i
do
know
causing
it
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
they
caught
the
specimen
they
want
there
an
e
down
there
so
naturally
the
trap
door
is
closed
cal
did
know
could
have
known
that
his
efforts
to
signal
mcginnis
not
to
land
were
unnecessary
did
know
could
have
known
that
he
himself
was
the
specimen
they
had
hoped
to
catch
that
having
caught
what
they
wanted
they
would
naturally
close
the
door
to
the
trap
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
escape
as
yet
or
any
interference
with
their
experiment
from
the
moment
he
walked
away
from
the
grassy
slope
where
he
had
signaled
the
outer
ship
he
moved
and
thought
as
someone
detached
from
ordinary
existence
as
he
walked
away
from
the
slope
ignoring
the
frantic
signals
from
the
ship
out
in
space
he
felt
he
was
also
walking
out
of
a
shell
of
superficial
cerebration
and
into
a
deeper
sense
of
reality
it
was
as
if
in
spite
of
e
training
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
could
commit
himself
wholly
in
all
areas
of
his
being
to
the
consideration
of
a
problem
his
conviction
was
complete
that
the
ship
could
give
him
nothing
he
needed
that
all
earth
mechanical
science
could
give
him
nothing
he
needed
that
it
could
not
provide
the
key
to
unlock
the
door
which
led
into
this
new
area
of
reality
he
must
find
must
define
some
new
concept
of
man
relation
to
the
universe
he
must
again
travel
that
road
that
road
man
had
traveled
in
trying
to
determine
his
position
in
reality
he
wandered
down
to
the
river
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
great
boulder
that
overhung
a
pool
and
sat
down
with
his
feet
hanging
over
the
edge
he
watched
some
young
colonists
wade
through
the
pool
to
drive
fish
into
the
shallows
where
they
could
pin
them
with
their
legs
catch
them
with
their
hands
in
their
need
for
protein
the
colonists
were
finding
as
many
earth
peoples
had
found
raw
fish
were
excellent
in
flavor
and
texture
as
food
at
the
beginning
of
the
road
man
had
traveled
first
there
was
awareness
awareness
of
self
as
something
separate
from
environment
there
was
awareness
of
ability
to
do
certain
things
to
and
with
that
environment
there
was
awareness
of
self
always
at
the
center
of
things
and
therefore
awareness
of
his
importance
in
the
scheme
of
things
but
there
was
awareness
of
more
there
was
awareness
of
things
happening
to
his
environment
which
he
in
all
his
strength
and
importance
could
not
do
awareness
gives
rise
to
reason
reason
gives
rise
to
rationalization
if
things
happened
in
his
environment
which
he
himself
could
not
do
then
there
must
be
something
stronger
and
more
important
than
he
to
be
ascendant
at
the
center
of
things
to
remain
ascendant
meant
that
all
things
of
lesser
importance
outside
the
center
must
be
made
subservient
to
him
else
that
ascendancy
was
lost
and
if
they
would
not
assume
positions
of
subservience
they
must
be
destroyed
if
there
were
unseen
beings
stronger
and
more
important
than
he
who
could
do
unexplained
things
to
his
environment
then
it
was
plain
that
he
must
assume
positions
of
subservience
to
those
beings
lest
he
himself
be
destroyed
so
man
created
his
gods
in
his
own
image
with
his
own
attributes
magnified
was
this
a
wrong
turning
of
the
road
awareness
carries
with
it
its
commands
and
penalties
a
problem
must
have
an
answer
conscious
and
willful
beings
beyond
his
own
strength
and
importance
became
the
only
answer
open
to
him
at
that
stage
of
his
mental
evolution
and
served
the
important
need
of
bringing
order
to
chaos
let
all
things
he
could
not
do
and
therefore
could
not
understand
be
attributed
to
those
higher
beings
without
such
an
answer
awareness
without
resolution
would
have
driven
him
into
madness
without
such
an
answer
man
could
not
have
survived
to
remain
aware
but
answers
also
carry
in
themselves
their
commands
and
their
penalties
the
penalty
being
that
when
one
thinks
he
has
the
answer
he
stops
looking
for
it
the
command
being
that
he
must
conduct
himself
in
accord
with
the
answer
the
long
long
road
that
led
him
nowhere
that
today
still
leads
untold
millions
nowhere
for
the
penalty
of
a
wrong
answer
is
failure
to
solve
the
problem
that
had
failed
to
provide
any
answer
beyond
the
primitive
one
was
to
some
then
it
became
evident
that
the
question
must
be
reopened
through
the
long
written
history
of
man
here
and
there
by
accident
often
sometimes
by
cerebration
the
use
of
the
brain
with
which
he
was
endowed
man
found
on
occasion
he
could
do
things
to
his
environment
that
heretofore
had
been
the
province
of
the
gods
and
in
the
doing
had
not
become
a
god
to
the
courageous
the
brave
the
daring
the
foolhardy
questions
then
that
demanded
new
answers
perhaps
the
most
daring
and
courageous
question
of
all
time
was
asked
by
copernicus
what
if
man
is
not
at
the
center
of
the
universe
the
reason
for
its
creation
he
personally
escaped
the
penalties
for
asking
it
the
question
was
too
new
too
revolutionary
for
the
men
of
his
day
to
grasp
for
the
leaders
secure
in
their
ascendancy
at
the
center
of
things
to
see
in
it
the
threat
to
their
ascendancy
it
was
on
his
followers
those
who
saw
sense
in
the
question
that
the
wrath
of
descended
used
the
only
method
it
had
ever
devised
to
achieve
the
only
result
it
had
ever
been
able
to
countenance
torture
and
force
to
make
dissidents
kneel
in
subservience
but
the
question
had
been
asked
and
once
asked
it
could
not
be
erased
still
it
was
almost
an
accidental
question
for
the
method
of
science
as
something
understood
and
communicable
as
a
calculated
point
of
view
had
not
yet
been
discovered
the
key
that
would
unlock
its
door
had
not
yet
been
found
cal
lay
back
on
the
rock
to
bathe
in
the
warm
rays
of
ceti
almost
to
doze
yet
with
thought
running
clear
and
unimpeded
the
splashing
and
the
laughter
of
the
colonists
below
the
rock
were
no
more
than
accompanying
music
the
key
which
opened
the
door
to
physical
science
was
not
discovered
until
by
a
bunch
of
loafers
beatniks
who
hung
around
the
coffee
shops
of
london
later
because
always
persecutes
those
who
dare
ask
questions
and
thereby
demonstrate
some
subversion
to
subservience
many
had
to
flee
to
oxford
which
at
that
time
was
sanctuary
for
those
who
differed
from
popular
thought
as
he
lay
there
drinking
in
the
sun
the
peacefulness
he
sent
his
vision
back
through
the
card
index
of
his
mind
to
find
the
reference
the
key
that
opened
the
door
to
physical
science
the
pregnant
point
of
view
that
would
give
birth
to
a
whole
new
concept
of
man
relationship
to
the
universe
he
found
the
passages
in
thomas
sprat
of
the
royal
society
of
london
to
make
faithful
records
of
all
the
works
of
nature
or
art
which
can
come
within
their
reach
they
have
stud
to
make
it
not
only
an
enterprise
of
one
season
or
of
some
lucky
opportunity
but
a
business
of
time
a
steddy
a
lasting
a
popular
an
uninterrupted
work
he
stirred
restlessly
and
changed
his
position
to
lay
his
head
on
one
arm
not
quite
not
yet
the
key
ah
here
it
was
perhaps
the
most
significant
sentence
ever
written
by
man
they
have
attempted
to
free
it
from
the
artifice
and
humors
and
passions
of
sects
to
render
it
an
instrument
whereby
mankind
may
obtain
a
dominion
over
and
not
only
over
one
another
judgements
that
was
it
that
was
the
essence
of
its
difference
from
for
the
only
method
ever
discovered
until
then
was
the
method
of
making
its
judgments
prevail
over
all
others
once
this
answer
was
discovered
it
too
could
not
be
erased
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
with
that
answer
man
had
come
this
far
and
now
could
it
be
that
science
as
with
was
only
a
partial
answer
only
another
stage
only
a
section
of
the
road
man
must
travel
something
as
limited
in
its
way
as
was
limited
something
too
narrow
to
contain
the
whole
of
reality
something
also
to
be
left
behind
a
milestone
passed
instead
of
the
goal
what
comes
after
science
what
new
door
must
be
opened
into
a
still
newer
point
of
view
what
pregnant
new
concept
of
his
relationship
to
reality
must
man
now
discover
before
he
could
continue
his
journey
down
the
long
road
toward
total
comprehension
he
could
ask
the
question
but
it
was
not
the
right
question
for
it
contained
no
hint
of
an
answer
he
felt
an
irritation
in
himself
almost
as
if
some
teacher
in
the
past
had
shaken
his
head
in
disapproval
for
a
moment
he
welcomed
the
distracting
shout
from
one
of
the
colonists
and
sat
up
in
the
shallows
of
the
river
one
of
the
men
had
caught
a
foot
long
fish
and
was
holding
it
up
in
his
hands
delightedly
the
others
acknowledged
his
victory
and
renewed
their
efforts
he
lay
back
down
again
and
stretched
his
cramped
muscles
too
fast
he
had
come
down
the
long
long
road
too
fast
he
had
missed
something
something
early
something
man
had
known
in
and
had
forgotten
in
science
these
colonists
would
they
grow
in
awareness
now
they
seemed
only
to
be
a
part
of
their
environment
without
curiosity
their
fears
of
even
the
day
before
forgotten
wiped
away
as
though
it
had
never
been
was
their
memory
of
a
previous
existence
to
this
they
were
wholly
at
one
with
their
environment
unaware
were
they
to
begin
the
long
road
to
telescope
its
distance
would
they
be
able
to
continue
living
without
peopling
the
trees
the
streams
the
clouds
the
winds
with
spirits
benign
and
vengeful
created
in
their
own
image
could
they
continue
to
live
alone
in
the
universe
yes
that
was
the
thing
he
had
missed
loneliness
in
separating
himself
from
the
animals
man
had
cut
off
his
kinship
with
them
and
so
he
found
companionship
with
the
gods
and
cutting
himself
off
from
the
gods
loneliness
was
man
the
only
thing
aware
throughout
the
universe
what
purpose
then
his
exploration
of
it
what
might
he
find
that
he
had
not
already
found
already
like
a
minor
thread
almost
unheard
in
the
symphony
of
exploding
exploration
the
questions
of
the
artists
were
already
finding
themselves
woven
into
music
painting
literature
are
we
alone
in
all
this
glittering
sterile
universe
are
there
none
other
than
we
who
are
aware
the
theme
would
expand
as
the
purposelessness
of
colonizing
still
more
and
more
worlds
became
wider
known
the
minor
would
become
major
the
recessive
dominant
the
endless
aim
of
to
make
all
others
subservient
had
lost
its
purpose
for
those
who
could
still
think
the
dominion
over
things
instead
of
people
the
goal
of
science
was
that
also
to
lose
its
purpose
for
those
who
could
still
think
until
man
defeated
by
purposelessness
sank
back
in
apathy
lost
the
very
willingness
to
live
and
so
died
what
if
some
other
awareness
did
inhabit
the
universe
sentient
and
lonely
what
if
farther
along
in
its
explorations
it
was
feeling
that
apathy
facing
that
dissolution
when
one
is
lonely
the
sensible
thing
is
to
seek
companionship
to
discover
in
companionship
purpose
not
apparent
to
the
alone
or
at
least
hope
to
discover
it
for
companionship
there
must
be
communication
and
yet
the
exasperation
the
futility
of
trying
to
communicate
with
a
friend
who
always
interpreted
everything
one
said
and
did
as
meaning
something
entirely
different
from
the
intent
some
other
friend
was
the
normal
answer
but
what
if
there
were
no
other
would
one
extra
effort
a
final
attempt
to
break
through
that
closed
mind
be
made
all
right
communication
then
that
was
wanted
he
would
try
but
if
their
frameworks
were
so
different
from
his
that
they
misinterpreted
all
his
efforts
he
was
interrupted
by
the
soft
pad
of
footsteps
bare
feet
on
grass
that
sprang
up
to
leave
no
sign
it
had
been
trod
upon
a
young
colonist
and
his
wife
hand
in
hand
laughing
gaily
were
coming
toward
him
the
man
was
carrying
a
fish
they
came
to
a
stop
at
the
base
of
his
rock
and
looked
up
at
him
the
ceti
light
glinting
on
their
smiling
faces
we
gave
louie
a
fish
because
he
said
it
was
our
duty
the
young
man
said
i
do
remember
why
it
is
our
duty
perhaps
it
is
our
duty
to
give
you
one
too
at
least
they
were
being
impartial
when
he
had
pulled
the
scaled
skin
of
the
fish
away
from
the
flesh
the
flesh
away
from
the
bones
and
eaten
his
fill
cal
lay
back
on
the
rock
again
to
doze
to
continue
his
search
for
a
means
of
communicating
he
was
now
sharply
aware
of
their
presence
of
their
urgency
of
their
long
patience
awareness
once
man
had
got
over
his
greedy
delight
in
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
universe
simply
because
he
could
to
protect
himself
against
the
cosmic
loneliness
that
must
follow
he
too
would
be
searching
for
awareness
but
he
would
define
it
in
his
own
terms
and
pass
it
by
if
it
did
not
meet
those
terms
that
there
was
some
other
intelligence
which
had
found
man
instead
cal
did
not
doubt
the
experiment
of
eden
the
manipulation
of
natural
laws
the
denial
of
physical
tools
for
what
purpose
to
clear
away
the
debris
which
prevented
communication
of
awareness
as
they
defined
it
there
was
a
trace
a
minor
trace
of
awareness
in
man
not
dependent
upon
the
tools
and
artifacts
of
physical
science
perception
psi
underdeveloped
because
with
physical
tools
its
development
had
been
made
unnecessary
because
having
found
the
answers
with
physical
tools
man
stopped
looking
for
answers
other
than
these
was
there
then
a
science
of
controlling
things
forces
without
the
use
of
physical
tools
was
there
a
road
of
transition
from
the
crude
manipulation
of
things
and
forces
through
tools
to
a
manipulation
without
them
there
was
precedent
in
man
science
the
elaborate
wirings
of
the
first
bulky
and
crude
electronic
sets
that
gave
way
to
a
printed
diagram
of
such
wirings
on
a
card
to
obtain
the
same
result
a
step
farther
the
visual
picture
the
mental
image
of
the
diagram
to
obtain
the
same
result
but
how
to
one
whose
total
orientation
is
through
the
use
of
physical
tools
for
the
material
printed
on
the
card
diagram
was
the
physical
carrier
of
the
current
how
to
cause
the
current
to
follow
the
mental
image
of
that
diagram
with
voice
and
music
bathing
one
senses
simply
because
one
thought
of
the
diagram
of
a
receiver
how
he
felt
like
the
turkey
come
up
against
the
obstruction
of
a
fence
too
low
to
justify
the
effort
of
flying
over
it
instead
of
flying
he
was
walking
around
and
around
looking
for
an
opening
walking
in
an
endless
circle
circle
excitedly
he
climbed
down
from
the
rock
and
headed
for
a
patch
of
bare
sand
at
the
river
edge
in
every
framework
of
thought
which
man
had
ever
devised
the
circle
was
prominent
vital
it
played
its
part
in
every
creed
of
every
race
of
every
time
it
was
as
essential
to
the
ancient
arts
of
magic
as
to
the
current
methods
of
science
it
played
its
part
in
the
movement
of
planets
the
shape
of
stars
perhaps
the
essence
of
the
total
universe
man
might
be
too
didactic
in
requiring
that
awareness
develop
a
physical
science
comparable
to
his
own
but
surely
awareness
whatever
form
it
took
would
know
the
circle
he
sank
down
on
his
haunches
beside
the
smooth
sand
and
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
he
quickly
drew
a
circle
the
furrow
scratched
in
the
sand
did
not
close
or
smooth
out
he
sat
back
and
waited
nothing
happened
it
was
almost
as
if
the
invisible
intelligence
were
saying
all
right
you
are
aware
of
a
circle
that
was
obvious
to
us
from
your
artifacts
what
else
do
you
know
he
leaned
forward
and
as
nearly
as
he
could
estimate
he
dotted
the
center
of
the
circle
with
a
finger
then
scratched
a
radius
to
the
perimeter
it
stayed
to
one
side
he
drew
another
line
approximating
the
radius
and
in
parenthesis
he
drew
a
small
beside
this
he
wrote
he
drew
an
equals
sign
he
scratched
the
pi
sign
then
he
drew
another
circle
and
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
smoothed
all
its
interior
that
should
be
plain
enough
the
symbols
stayed
they
understood
his
mathematics
then
the
equation
seemed
undisturbed
yet
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
he
had
to
look
closely
at
the
sand
before
he
saw
what
it
was
the
had
changed
to
why
had
they
changed
the
meaning
by
substituting
proportionate
to
for
equals
he
felt
a
flash
of
exasperation
well
sure
without
tools
he
could
not
draw
a
perfect
circle
nor
two
of
them
entirely
equal
it
was
pedantic
of
them
to
split
hairs
over
that
he
must
practice
without
tools
to
draw
a
perfect
circle
or
was
that
running
around
inside
his
low
fence
he
looked
down
at
the
sand
and
saw
the
entire
scratching
was
now
smoothed
out
apparently
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
had
got
what
they
meant
he
wrote
again
in
the
sand
pi
again
changed
to
again
he
felt
his
flash
of
exasperation
it
must
be
obvious
by
his
string
of
dots
that
he
knew
pi
had
never
been
exactly
resolved
they
were
being
too
pedantic
he
must
exactly
resolve
it
yet
the
numbers
could
be
continued
to
infinity
and
never
exactly
resolved
he
looked
down
again
and
the
equation
was
gone
wrong
track
again
he
sat
forward
hugged
his
knees
and
stared
into
the
water
the
equation
had
never
been
exactly
resolved
yet
man
used
it
as
a
constant
an
absolute
an
obvious
fallacy
was
the
difference
between
physical
science
and
psi
science
based
in
this
insignificant
difference
in
exactness
try
something
else
see
what
happens
there
was
an
equation
which
had
proved
its
effectiveness
upon
which
the
whole
science
of
atomics
was
based
e
he
wrote
again
changed
to
what
were
they
saying
that
the
fallacy
lay
in
using
the
equals
sign
that
the
science
of
psi
was
one
of
proportion
but
equals
was
one
of
the
possible
proportions
had
we
become
walled
in
our
low
fence
because
we
were
too
dependent
upon
the
exact
balance
been
satisfied
to
find
that
answer
and
therefore
stopped
looking
for
the
possibilities
inherent
in
unbalanced
equations
he
looked
down
at
the
symbols
again
half
expecting
to
see
them
erased
but
they
were
still
there
so
he
was
starting
on
the
right
track
but
wait
before
his
eyes
he
saw
the
smooth
out
disappear
only
e
m
remained
were
they
saying
that
dependence
upon
constants
was
the
low
fence
that
man
must
learn
to
do
without
his
firm
absolutes
that
was
the
ultimate
in
relativity
energy
is
proportionate
to
matter
but
so
as
to
be
too
vague
for
use
for
more
than
three
centuries
now
controversy
had
raged
over
use
of
in
his
expression
some
held
that
it
was
a
product
of
his
time
that
he
was
able
to
make
only
one
step
beyond
classical
physics
where
all
things
must
be
related
to
a
fixed
value
others
held
that
its
inclusion
was
a
deliberate
fallacy
that
einstein
by
his
other
work
had
shown
he
knew
it
was
a
fallacy
that
tongue
in
cheek
he
inserted
it
into
his
equation
in
full
knowledge
that
his
fellow
scientists
of
his
day
could
not
even
bear
to
think
of
the
awesome
concept
of
things
without
orientation
to
an
absolute
that
he
knew
they
would
reject
him
entirely
refuse
even
to
consider
his
thought
unless
he
catered
that
much
to
their
superstitions
the
need
of
the
absolute
was
not
mathematical
or
scientific
but
emotional
man
was
still
tortured
by
his
determination
to
be
the
center
of
things
himself
the
fixed
absolute
the
need
of
a
familiar
fixed
cave
where
he
might
run
and
hide
close
himself
in
securely
when
the
chaos
of
storm
outside
became
too
frightening
to
bear
the
need
of
a
fixed
absolute
whether
in
philosophy
or
science
a
fixed
spot
that
would
not
shift
the
science
of
psi
then
was
based
in
a
willingness
to
shift
he
looked
down
at
the
equation
to
see
if
he
were
still
on
the
track
it
had
changed
again
now
it
read
eδm
the
form
of
the
function
of
energy
to
matter
is
variable
quickly
another
change
df
em
the
form
of
the
function
and
the
independent
variable
of
the
function
vary
together
still
another
e
f
m
there
is
a
general
relationship
of
energy
to
matter
and
then
f
e
m
there
is
a
general
unspecified
relationship
between
energy
and
matter
he
slapped
his
hand
down
on
the
sand
in
frustration
all
right
he
said
you
made
your
point
and
it
means
about
as
much
as
if
i
said
to
the
turkey
you
have
to
do
is
fly
there
was
a
stir
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
louie
a
deep
sigh
almost
a
sob
came
from
louie
as
he
stared
down
at
the
symbols
in
the
sand
they
talked
to
louie
said
brokenly
i
wanted
only
to
serve
them
but
it
was
to
they
talked
and
all
the
tragedy
of
his
life
was
contained
therein
cal
sprang
to
his
feet
and
put
his
arms
around
the
other
shoulders
the
two
of
them
the
bitter
and
the
sympathetic
looked
down
at
the
sand
the
symbols
were
still
changing
and
now
read
there
is
an
infinity
of
relationships
between
matter
and
energy
an
infinity
of
forms
to
be
taken
by
matter
as
you
control
the
energy
the
signs
were
wiped
out
and
the
sense
of
their
presence
was
gone
cal
felt
the
withdrawal
the
sense
of
a
lesson
being
over
he
did
not
regret
it
he
had
enough
to
think
about
but
first
there
was
louie
racked
with
broken
sobbing
here
was
a
man
whose
life
had
been
a
search
for
certainties
absolutes
that
would
not
shift
under
the
weight
of
his
questioning
no
doubt
in
his
youth
he
had
turned
to
the
religions
of
the
day
and
found
them
a
tissue
of
rationalizations
without
contact
in
reality
then
to
science
and
found
it
too
constantly
shifting
in
its
interpretations
making
new
evaluations
as
evidence
discounted
the
old
the
shock
of
landing
on
eden
to
drive
him
back
into
childhood
interpretations
again
at
last
the
clear
evidence
that
had
been
denied
his
belief
in
youth
wholehearted
in
his
belief
of
them
yet
it
was
not
to
him
they
had
talked
louie
cal
said
slowly
if
you
were
lonely
very
lonely
if
you
had
searched
through
the
years
for
companionship
and
thought
you
might
have
found
it
would
it
please
you
to
have
that
companion
drop
to
his
knees
grovel
before
you
would
this
be
your
idea
of
companionship
what
manner
of
monstrous
egotism
would
require
that
what
but
the
incredible
vanity
of
primitive
man
to
whom
life
meant
nothing
more
than
conquering
or
being
conquered
could
imagine
such
conduct
would
be
pleasing
to
another
intelligence
we
are
men
louie
if
in
our
loneliness
we
found
another
intelligence
would
we
want
an
equal
exchange
instead
of
abasement
the
use
of
that
intelligence
to
know
to
understand
instead
of
a
denial
of
it
louie
twisted
out
of
cal
embracing
arm
and
ran
stumbling
toward
the
depths
of
the
forest
for
another
week
perhaps
ten
days
or
more
since
time
measurement
had
lost
its
meaning
cal
lived
among
the
colonists
watched
their
complete
retrogression
into
a
state
of
unawareness
even
the
speech
which
they
had
retained
seemed
now
to
thin
and
falter
as
the
simplifying
of
their
no
longer
required
its
use
only
tom
and
jed
seemed
to
retain
their
orientation
to
the
past
the
clarity
of
awareness
these
two
spent
much
time
together
seemed
always
available
when
cal
needed
them
yet
did
not
intrude
upon
his
thought
frank
now
seemed
one
with
the
colonists
louie
lived
on
the
outskirts
of
the
herd
near
the
colonists
but
not
of
them
he
had
ceased
to
exhort
warn
command
argue
his
face
was
closed
told
nothing
of
what
he
was
thinking
and
he
had
ceased
to
demand
his
tithe
as
intercessor
he
was
gathering
his
own
food
catching
his
own
fish
and
he
seldom
let
cal
out
of
his
sight
tom
and
jed
helped
as
best
they
could
by
maintaining
contact
with
the
old
reality
they
spent
much
of
the
daytime
with
the
colonists
at
night
they
turned
their
faces
to
the
dark
sky
to
watch
the
ships
now
grown
to
four
bathed
in
the
light
of
ceti
like
a
constellation
of
bright
stars
above
them
they
read
the
intermittent
flashes
of
light
from
mcginnis
and
from
the
laboratory
mcginnis
told
of
the
police
attempts
to
break
through
the
barrier
surrounding
eden
and
its
failure
the
laboratory
told
of
linda
presence
on
board
and
now
and
then
flashed
out
a
message
to
cal
from
linda
of
her
love
her
nearness
her
faith
in
him
her
desire
to
be
with
him
her
patience
in
waiting
mcginnis
told
of
the
arrival
of
a
fifth
ship
carrying
gunderson
in
person
he
had
been
unable
to
believe
his
police
captain
unable
to
believe
that
the
ship
could
not
land
at
will
he
had
come
in
person
to
take
charge
and
apparently
fumed
his
frustration
in
idleness
unable
to
do
anything
with
the
situation
unwilling
to
go
back
to
earth
and
leave
it
alone
tom
and
jed
told
cal
the
content
of
these
messages
but
to
cal
the
reports
of
the
police
activity
seemed
noises
heard
from
far
away
and
unrelated
to
himself
the
messages
from
linda
seemed
the
haunting
strains
of
a
song
remembered
from
long
ago
for
his
mind
was
wholly
enrapt
with
the
problem
he
had
been
given
the
key
reality
is
a
matter
of
proportion
change
the
concept
of
proportion
and
you
change
the
material
form
but
he
had
not
found
the
lock
and
the
door
it
would
open
he
knew
it
but
he
could
do
it
perhaps
tom
might
help
tom
was
in
math
had
to
be
for
his
job
as
pilot
look
tom
cal
said
one
morning
after
they
had
given
him
the
messages
from
the
ships
he
squatted
on
the
ground
and
brushed
away
some
leaves
from
an
area
of
dirt
watch
the
equals
sign
he
scratched
a
formula
in
the
dirt
the
changed
to
then
to
δ
then
through
the
series
of
variable
relationships
tom
leaped
to
his
feet
from
the
log
where
he
had
been
sitting
that
crazy
he
exclaimed
it
is
just
proportionate
it
variable
it
equals
jed
was
looking
from
one
to
the
other
obviously
at
a
loss
well
cal
said
drily
i
much
more
interested
in
what
they
have
to
say
than
in
trying
to
convince
them
that
they
wrong
but
if
everything
were
only
proportionate
and
variable
tom
argued
then
you
have
nothing
fixed
constant
why
the
proportionate
relationship
might
be
dependent
solely
upon
choice
nothing
would
be
solid
dependable
not
even
the
footprints
under
your
feet
cal
answered
softly
not
a
house
nor
a
field
of
grain
nor
a
spaceship
simply
alter
the
choice
of
proportion
and
they
are
there
anymore
throw
a
key
at
the
feet
of
a
turkey
and
it
is
useless
to
him
show
him
the
lock
it
fits
and
it
is
still
useless
without
the
knowledge
of
how
to
insert
the
key
and
turn
it
unlock
it
for
him
and
still
it
is
useless
without
the
knowledge
of
how
to
push
or
pull
the
door
this
was
the
essence
of
why
so
few
mastered
the
simple
steps
of
physical
science
the
essence
of
why
so
few
were
able
to
get
beyond
step
two
of
e
science
anyone
could
disagree
with
a
statement
but
in
answer
to
what
if
it
not
be
true
how
then
to
account
for
the
phenomena
most
bogged
down
at
that
point
unable
to
demonstrate
with
evidence
the
validity
of
some
other
answer
everyone
knew
the
equation
e
but
few
could
implement
it
to
build
an
atomic
power
plant
perhaps
the
reactions
of
tom
that
taking
away
the
concept
of
a
balanced
equation
destroyed
all
certainty
and
therefore
was
not
to
be
countenanced
was
a
reflection
of
his
own
reaction
willing
though
he
might
be
to
consider
something
else
in
his
wanderings
about
the
island
picking
fruits
and
nuts
stems
and
leaves
catching
fish
when
he
hungered
drinking
the
clear
water
of
the
stream
when
he
thirsted
yet
so
enrapt
that
he
was
unaware
he
was
taking
care
of
his
body
needs
cal
built
up
whole
structures
of
alien
philosophies
on
the
nature
of
the
universe
and
saw
them
topple
of
their
own
weight
until
at
last
he
realized
the
basic
flaw
in
all
his
reasoning
he
was
too
in
the
essence
of
physical
science
and
all
physical
science
was
built
on
the
balanced
equation
even
in
trying
to
consider
the
unbalanced
equation
he
had
been
attempting
to
determine
the
exact
nature
of
the
unbalance
and
to
supply
it
as
an
x
factor
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
to
restore
balance
to
restore
balance
was
to
maintain
the
status
quo
of
physical
reality
to
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
to
open
the
door
he
must
change
the
physical
reality
to
balance
the
equation
rather
than
supply
the
x
factor
to
keep
reality
unchanged
but
how
to
do
it
still
eluded
him
at
times
as
if
seeing
partial
diagrams
he
seemed
very
close
to
a
solution
at
times
it
seemed
the
printed
card
of
an
electronic
wiring
was
necessary
only
because
the
human
mind
could
not
visualize
the
whole
without
that
aid
that
music
did
not
come
through
because
in
incomplete
visualization
some
little
part
was
left
dangling
unconnected
and
the
long
history
of
belief
in
the
magic
properties
of
cabalistic
signs
and
designs
rose
up
to
taunt
him
to
goad
him
with
the
possibility
that
perhaps
man
had
once
come
close
to
the
answer
of
how
to
control
physical
properties
without
the
use
of
tools
that
the
development
of
a
physical
science
had
taken
man
down
a
sidetrack
instead
of
farther
along
the
direct
route
toward
his
goal
or
that
man
had
once
been
shown
and
never
understood
or
forgot
yet
kept
alive
the
memory
that
physical
shifts
could
be
changed
if
he
could
only
draw
the
right
design
through
his
wanderings
one
fact
gradually
intruded
upon
his
mind
it
seemed
the
farther
inland
he
roamed
the
closer
he
came
to
grasping
the
problem
the
nearer
the
seashore
the
more
it
eluded
him
one
morning
he
looked
up
at
the
glittering
heights
of
crystal
palace
mountain
and
suddenly
he
resolved
to
climb
it
perhaps
the
winds
of
the
mountain
being
stronger
the
fuzziness
of
his
thought
would
be
blown
away
perhaps
the
arrangement
of
the
crystalline
structures
the
arches
and
spires
might
catch
his
brain
waves
modulate
them
transform
them
strengthen
them
feed
them
back
himself
a
part
of
the
design
instead
of
outside
it
in
the
framework
of
physical
science
a
nonsense
notion
but
what
harm
to
try
he
sought
out
tom
and
jed
the
two
who
would
miss
him
the
two
who
would
care
there
ai
no
water
up
there
far
as
i
know
jed
said
and
you
carry
none
now
me
and
a
party
scouted
the
mountain
once
it
mighty
purty
but
useless
the
quartz
ai
valuable
enough
to
cover
its
shipping
costs
back
to
earth
the
ground
is
too
rocky
to
farm
not
much
in
the
way
of
food
growing
there
so
we
never
went
back
the
scientists
surveyed
it
when
the
planet
was
first
discovered
cal
said
one
of
the
first
places
they
went
because
it
was
so
outstanding
but
they
found
nothing
interesting
and
useful
either
still
i
think
i
go
well
jed
said
with
a
shrug
you
ca
get
lost
if
you
should
lose
your
bearings
just
walk
downhill
and
you
come
to
food
and
water
follow
the
shore
line
until
you
get
back
either
direction
and
i
reckon
the
way
things
go
now
you
ai
goin
to
hurt
yourself
we
wo
worry
about
you
none
we
all
gettin
along
all
right
so
you
need
worry
about
us
either
you
want
me
to
come
with
you
cal
tom
asked
no
cal
answered
i
think
better
if
i
alone
he
left
them
then
went
past
some
colonists
who
were
picking
berries
and
eating
them
and
on
up
the
valley
that
ran
between
two
ridges
it
was
only
a
few
miles
to
the
foothills
a
gradual
rise
of
the
valley
floor
a
gradual
shallowing
and
narrowing
of
the
stream
a
gradual
drawing
in
of
the
spokelike
ridges
until
the
valley
at
last
became
a
ravine
the
morning
air
was
clear
and
still
the
scent
of
flowers
and
ripening
fruit
was
sweet
before
he
left
the
ravine
to
begin
his
climb
he
ate
some
of
the
fruit
and
washed
the
lingering
sweet
taste
from
his
mouth
with
a
long
cool
drink
of
water
from
one
of
the
many
springs
that
fed
the
stream
he
looked
up
at
the
mountain
above
him
and
his
eye
picked
out
the
most
likely
approach
to
its
summit
it
was
not
a
high
mountain
not
in
terms
of
those
tremendous
tortured
skin
folds
of
other
planets
hardly
more
than
a
high
hill
in
terms
of
those
nor
as
far
as
he
could
see
would
the
climb
be
difficult
or
hazardous
the
fanciful
thought
of
mount
olympus
on
earth
came
into
his
mind
although
this
one
was
not
so
inaccessible
so
parched
and
barren
the
gods
of
greece
would
have
found
this
a
pleasanter
place
although
they
might
not
have
lived
so
long
in
the
minds
of
man
since
the
mountain
was
more
easily
climbed
and
therefore
man
would
have
been
the
more
easily
convinced
after
repeated
explorations
that
no
gods
lived
there
after
all
would
the
greeks
as
with
the
later
religions
have
placed
the
site
of
heaven
farther
and
farther
away
retreating
reluctantly
as
man
explored
the
earlier
site
and
found
no
heaven
there
retreat
after
retreat
until
at
last
the
whole
idea
was
patently
ridiculous
dead
are
the
gods
forever
dead
and
yet
to
what
may
man
now
turn
in
rapture
in
ecstasy
in
communion
what
in
all
physical
science
filled
the
deep
human
need
of
these
expressions
the
climb
of
the
first
slope
up
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
he
intended
to
follow
was
quickly
done
he
turned
there
and
looked
behind
him
at
the
valley
of
the
colonists
below
and
far
down
where
the
valley
merged
into
the
sea
and
far
on
out
at
the
hazy
purple
line
of
another
island
as
he
started
to
turn
back
again
to
resume
his
climb
his
eye
caught
a
flash
of
something
moving
in
the
ravine
below
him
sunlight
on
brown
bare
skin
he
waited
until
he
caught
another
glimpse
through
the
trees
as
he
had
suspected
it
was
louie
still
trying
to
keep
him
always
in
sight
his
first
impulse
was
to
call
out
to
wait
for
louie
ask
him
to
join
in
the
climb
he
discarded
the
impulse
his
need
was
to
get
away
from
all
others
and
sympathetic
and
compassionate
though
he
might
be
the
confusion
in
louie
mind
seemed
to
intrude
upon
his
own
nor
had
his
earlier
attempts
to
comfort
louie
met
success
let
louie
follow
if
he
willed
perhaps
the
clean
air
would
clear
his
mind
as
well
he
feared
no
physical
harm
even
if
louie
tortured
mind
intended
it
there
were
no
tools
to
strike
at
him
from
a
distance
even
a
boulder
pushed
from
a
height
above
him
would
not
strike
for
that
would
be
the
physical
use
of
a
tool
to
gain
an
end
he
feared
no
bodily
attack
from
ambush
for
his
own
strength
and
knowledge
were
dependable
he
began
his
climb
again
followed
the
crest
of
the
ridge
where
it
swept
upward
to
buttress
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
going
was
not
difficult
the
trees
and
shrubs
grew
thinner
here
and
provided
clear
spaces
for
him
to
wind
among
them
the
stones
at
first
a
problem
to
his
bare
feet
bothered
him
less
and
less
until
he
forgot
them
he
felt
no
physical
discomfort
neither
from
tiredness
nor
thirst
nor
from
the
branches
scraping
his
bare
skin
nor
anything
to
drag
his
mind
into
trivialities
nor
tortured
theories
such
as
had
plagued
him
in
trying
to
reason
out
the
new
concepts
of
a
proportionate
variable
reality
instead
there
was
a
sense
of
well
being
anticipated
completeness
a
merging
of
the
often
quite
separated
areas
of
thought
intuition
and
appreciation
although
at
no
great
height
now
the
trees
no
longer
grew
so
tall
that
they
obscured
his
vision
of
the
heights
above
as
he
climbed
they
were
replaced
by
shrubs
shoulder
high
then
waist
high
then
merely
low
creeping
growths
which
his
feet
avoided
without
mental
direction
a
curve
of
the
ridge
brought
him
to
the
first
outcroppings
of
crystallized
quartz
on
them
he
saw
no
signs
of
scar
left
by
the
geologist
hammer
no
imperfections
where
nodes
may
have
been
broken
away
they
were
complete
singularly
unweathered
there
was
no
path
nor
hint
of
one
nor
sign
that
either
scientist
or
colonist
had
ever
passed
this
way
the
ridge
swung
back
into
line
and
still
he
climbed
effortlessly
and
without
consciousness
of
passing
time
time
and
space
and
matter
seemed
to
have
receded
far
into
the
background
of
consciousness
civilization
was
no
more
than
a
dream
it
was
as
if
he
alone
and
complete
occupied
the
whole
of
the
universe
encompassed
it
as
he
was
encompassed
by
it
yet
not
alone
their
presence
which
seemed
so
evanescent
on
the
valley
floor
was
closer
now
more
clearly
sensed
almost
as
if
at
any
instant
the
veil
of
blindness
would
disperse
and
they
would
stand
revealed
now
up
the
final
slope
of
the
mountain
he
threaded
his
way
through
higher
outcroppings
of
a
more
perfectly
formed
quartz
with
deeper
amethystine
hue
scintillating
in
the
ceti
sun
light
diffracted
not
only
in
the
purples
but
into
greens
and
reds
and
blues
as
he
came
around
the
base
of
one
of
these
there
towering
above
he
caught
his
first
full
view
of
the
greater
spires
pinnacles
buttresses
and
arches
of
the
mountain
crest
it
was
the
crystal
palace
the
climb
had
been
steep
steeper
than
it
had
appeared
from
below
yet
his
breathing
was
not
labored
his
mouth
was
not
dry
from
thirst
nor
were
his
muscles
protesting
the
effort
he
did
not
need
to
stop
and
rest
to
gather
his
energy
for
the
last
steep
assault
upon
the
peak
far
below
him
he
saw
louie
toiling
up
a
slope
then
dropping
with
every
appearance
of
exhaustion
when
he
came
to
each
level
place
still
he
would
rest
no
more
than
a
minute
and
always
his
head
was
turned
to
keep
sight
of
cal
above
him
he
would
push
himself
to
his
knees
then
to
his
feet
and
slowly
step
by
step
begin
his
climb
again
as
if
from
far
away
cal
felt
a
pity
at
the
uselessness
of
the
the
senseless
need
of
man
to
punish
himself
for
the
guilt
of
imagined
wrongs
and
felt
a
wonder
if
the
strangely
developed
moral
sense
of
man
had
not
after
all
done
more
harm
than
good
for
in
the
ordered
universe
where
everything
fitted
into
the
whole
what
could
be
either
good
or
bad
right
or
wrong
except
as
a
reflection
of
inadequacies
in
his
imaginings
rightness
and
good
wrongness
and
evil
these
could
not
possibly
be
other
than
assessments
of
furtherance
or
threat
to
the
ascendancy
of
at
the
center
of
things
and
had
no
meaning
beyond
that
context
he
turned
from
watching
louie
pitying
him
and
made
the
last
sharp
climb
with
no
more
effort
than
the
whole
had
been
now
he
drew
near
to
the
towering
structures
of
the
crest
now
he
was
beside
them
now
he
walked
beneath
and
through
an
arch
which
seemed
almost
a
gothic
entrance
and
stood
transfixed
in
ecstasy
magnificent
the
dreams
of
man
that
took
form
in
steel
and
stone
and
glass
yet
none
matched
the
lightness
the
grace
the
intricacy
the
sublime
simplicity
of
these
interwoven
crystalline
structures
where
light
from
the
noonday
sun
separated
prismatically
until
it
filled
the
air
with
myriads
of
living
darting
colored
sparks
of
fire
above
him
where
the
breeze
that
blew
through
the
vibrating
spires
made
blended
sounds
the
ear
could
barely
endure
in
rapture
as
once
in
childhood
he
had
stood
in
a
grove
of
giant
trees
that
laced
their
limbs
in
gothic
splendor
above
him
now
again
he
stood
lost
in
time
and
space
and
being
lost
in
vision
and
in
music
which
neither
had
nor
needed
form
nor
beginning
nor
end
and
knew
it
was
a
simple
tool
their
concession
to
the
mind
of
man
to
bridge
the
gap
between
their
minds
and
his
without
wondering
more
he
sank
down
upon
the
mossy
turf
of
the
floor
and
lay
supine
to
gaze
upward
to
follow
line
to
blended
line
until
they
seemed
mirrored
into
infinity
the
darting
lights
above
him
whirled
spiraled
up
then
down
clockwise
then
counterclockwise
reminding
him
reminding
him
the
internal
structure
of
crystals
across
the
universe
two
billion
years
ago
there
too
a
planet
coalesced
from
the
mutually
attracted
vortices
of
twisted
space
gases
compelled
by
gravitational
forces
solidifying
to
hardened
matter
forming
a
crust
over
a
molten
core
in
the
soupy
atmosphere
of
metallic
salts
and
gases
tortured
and
rent
by
electrical
storms
of
incalculable
fury
among
the
vibrating
crystals
one
formed
that
was
aware
not
in
the
sharp
awareness
of
later
times
but
at
the
first
only
perhaps
no
more
than
the
awareness
of
acid
chains
of
molecules
that
formed
into
viscid
protoplasm
on
another
planet
across
the
universe
no
distinct
line
of
cleavage
where
affinity
to
other
chemicals
left
off
and
sentient
selectivity
began
marked
the
distinction
here
as
in
that
protoplasm
as
with
its
cousin
across
the
universe
the
amoeba
these
crystals
too
were
sensitive
to
light
to
heat
to
cold
to
food
but
distinct
already
from
the
crystals
about
them
these
life
forms
grew
through
absorbing
from
the
rich
and
soupy
atmosphere
those
elements
necessary
to
growth
to
branching
to
cleavage
into
new
individuals
what
is
awareness
at
what
point
even
in
protoplasmic
life
does
it
appear
the
amoeba
avoids
pain
seeks
food
reproduces
itself
and
blunders
blindly
through
its
environment
in
search
for
condition
more
favorable
to
its
continuance
in
the
monotony
of
a
purposeless
existence
most
humans
do
no
more
than
that
must
awareness
too
be
defined
in
terms
of
the
consciousness
of
defined
only
by
what
can
feel
know
a
protoplasmic
growth
feeling
awareness
excluding
all
possibility
of
awareness
in
other
kinds
of
growth
because
they
are
not
a
part
of
therefore
too
inferior
to
know
awareness
each
crystal
structure
has
its
own
vibration
characteristic
and
on
that
planet
in
time
one
special
vibratory
rate
knew
awareness
of
self
mutation
here
too
gave
added
complexity
to
the
structure
and
took
on
that
added
growth
of
awareness
of
surroundings
through
eons
of
time
and
the
mutations
brought
by
time
awareness
of
self
and
surroundings
grew
into
awareness
of
wider
peripheries
to
sensing
their
world
its
structure
its
nature
another
mutant
leap
and
there
was
comprehension
of
other
worlds
of
other
stars
theirs
was
a
vibratory
awareness
directly
akin
to
the
vibrating
fields
of
force
which
compose
the
material
universe
and
the
vibrations
of
fields
of
force
can
be
altered
to
change
their
surroundings
to
a
more
suitable
environment
through
vibration
rates
of
things
led
surely
to
negation
of
distance
to
change
from
crystal
form
to
fields
of
energy
and
back
again
combined
with
negation
of
distance
they
too
spread
out
and
out
among
the
stars
at
first
it
was
enough
but
awareness
is
never
still
questions
form
in
all
the
universe
were
they
the
only
sentient
thing
did
any
cry
but
theirs
rise
to
the
stars
seeking
to
know
because
of
the
nature
of
their
being
their
search
was
unconcerned
with
the
outer
shape
of
things
which
could
be
changed
by
them
at
will
but
rather
with
the
inner
vibratory
rate
which
would
signal
sentience
awareness
they
found
no
more
than
unconscious
interaction
of
forces
water
runs
down
hill
without
knowing
that
it
does
without
the
internal
structure
to
provide
the
vibratory
rate
which
would
permit
knowing
for
long
eras
they
too
were
imprisoned
within
the
confines
of
a
envisioning
and
it
took
a
major
leap
for
them
to
conceive
that
other
structures
than
the
crystalline
might
have
a
form
of
awareness
alien
to
their
kind
perhaps
yet
a
kind
which
must
be
acknowledged
for
they
found
something
at
last
in
a
viscid
substance
protoplasm
on
one
distant
planet
this
substance
was
already
differentiated
and
specialized
to
a
high
degree
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
complex
of
its
organization
there
were
degrees
of
awareness
and
in
the
most
complex
of
these
there
was
undeniable
evidence
of
sentience
outside
of
self
joy
unparalleled
ecstasy
recognition
is
not
wisdom
with
the
unwisdom
of
inexperience
in
communicating
with
an
unlike
thing
not
realizing
that
the
values
of
their
kind
of
awareness
might
not
be
the
values
of
this
differing
kind
they
rushed
in
with
all
their
powers
and
forces
a
joyful
rapturous
pyrotechnical
display
of
material
manipulation
to
show
this
new
life
form
that
they
too
were
aware
to
communicate
that
the
loneliness
of
one
might
now
be
softened
by
the
presence
of
the
other
and
man
fell
down
to
the
ground
and
groveled
his
face
in
the
dust
his
awareness
was
of
the
outer
shapes
of
things
his
security
lay
in
adapting
himself
to
those
shapes
his
certainties
lay
in
the
dependability
of
those
shapes
a
rock
was
a
rock
but
no
the
crystals
were
delighted
that
they
had
brought
something
which
they
could
share
with
this
new
life
form
the
rock
could
be
a
tree
see
and
lo
the
rock
was
a
tree
and
the
people
were
sore
afraid
for
that
which
had
been
certain
and
sure
was
no
longer
so
this
mountain
wall
which
had
formed
an
impassable
barrier
to
migration
into
a
new
and
richer
valley
was
rent
asunder
so
and
beyond
the
new
valley
beckoned
but
the
people
huddled
in
their
caves
and
dared
not
venture
forth
the
vibrating
entities
no
longer
dependent
upon
their
crystalline
forms
withdrew
to
confer
among
themselves
to
one
life
form
awareness
composed
of
the
outer
shape
of
things
the
relationship
of
those
shapes
security
in
the
unchanging
shape
to
the
other
life
form
awareness
composed
of
the
inner
vibration
the
relationships
of
those
vibrations
with
outer
shapes
changed
at
will
and
therefore
meaningless
yet
even
this
protoplasmic
life
must
see
the
changing
shapes
of
things
the
clouds
that
formed
and
disappeared
the
seed
that
became
root
and
stem
and
leaf
and
flower
the
infant
that
became
man
and
man
that
decomposed
as
corpse
surely
this
life
form
must
see
an
inner
cause
surely
they
must
see
that
even
the
permanent
rock
changed
slowly
into
dust
that
the
eternal
sea
was
restless
never
still
that
stars
moved
in
the
vault
of
heavens
warmth
changed
to
cold
and
night
to
day
how
did
they
account
for
changes
in
these
outer
forms
if
not
by
inner
cause
they
changed
the
shapes
of
things
themselves
these
men
the
seed
ground
into
meal
the
moving
animal
shot
down
with
stick
or
stone
and
stilled
and
changed
to
food
the
moving
of
the
smaller
rocks
erection
of
a
dwelling
made
of
poles
and
thatch
to
change
environment
for
the
man
inside
change
then
man
knew
why
fear
the
greater
change
the
easier
one
why
tug
and
lift
and
strain
to
move
the
boulder
from
the
path
when
all
was
needed
was
to
shift
proportion
in
one
tiny
way
rebalance
the
equation
of
relationship
with
one
slight
thought
and
lo
the
stone
no
longer
barred
the
way
too
long
ago
lost
in
the
distant
past
the
crystals
had
forgot
their
own
of
all
other
things
to
forgot
to
credit
it
to
man
to
lift
the
boulder
with
one
strength
to
serve
a
purpose
was
within
the
ken
of
man
a
thing
that
he
could
do
to
see
it
lifted
moved
without
his
strength
bespoke
a
greater
strength
than
his
and
purpose
that
he
could
not
understand
and
man
fell
to
his
knees
in
fear
and
awe
for
man
knew
only
one
relation
to
all
things
to
conquer
if
he
could
and
force
acknowledgment
of
superior
strength
and
purpose
to
kill
if
that
acknowledgment
was
not
given
to
survive
by
giving
that
acknowledgment
to
a
stronger
one
than
he
man
groveled
in
the
dust
the
only
pattern
of
survival
that
he
knew
when
strength
beyond
his
own
was
shown
but
even
while
he
knelt
to
scheme
a
way
that
might
find
ascendancy
in
future
days
the
one
invariable
pattern
persisting
from
the

the
only

possible
while
ascendant
is
the

and

to

another

then
the

aim
ascendancy
of
was
meaningless
belonged
to
orders
of
awareness
lower
than
intelligence
that
they
could
meet
in
partnership
instruct
them
then
no

or
purpose
in
conquering
them
no
companionship
in
these
disgusting
grovelings
show
them
the
inner
forces
that
controlled
the
outer
shapes
of
things
once
crystals
now
divorced
from
hardened
form
the
outer
shape
of
things
was
no
longer
a
consideration
in
their
life
but
for
this
form
of
life
still
dependent
for
that
life
upon
the
maintenance
of
material
form
no
doubt
the
shapes
and
forms
of
things
were
paramount
to
them
well

the

that

the

interact
before
the
kneeling

the
cabalistic
diagrams
took
shape
and
lo
a
spring
of
water
flowed
from
dry
and
barren
stone
but
man
saw
only
shape
of
diagram
its
cabalistic
lines
and
form
a
sacred
thing
a
magic
thing
a
sign
that
he
might
draw
with
finger
in
the
air
or
in
the
sand
protection
from
the
evil
forces
that
surrounded
him
the
sentient
fields
of
force
withdrew
too
soon
too
soon
man
was
not
ready
for
communication
too
soon
too
soon
but
man
did
not
forget
the
memory
lived
on
and
fathers
spoke
to
sons
and
made
the
outer
forms
of
gestures
drew
the
cabalistic
signs
and
told
of
magic
things
and
powers
that
these
signs
could
do
to
some
one
diagram
was
shown
a
way
to
build
a
house
of
stone
that
better
weathered
the
storms
of
earth
the
house
of
stone
became
a
holy
place
a
thing
existing
in
its
own
right
and
not
as
was
intended
an
example
of
one
use
to
which
this
arrangement
of
forces
might
be
put
and
to
some
other
man
another
diagram
was
shown
this
time
to
slay
an
animal
for
food
and
men
fought
wars
over
these
differing
symbols
each
side
determined
to
make
its
symbol
ascendant
over
the
other
deep
within
the
asian
land
where
contact
had
been
made
the
memories
lived
on
and
some
of
the
meaning
of
the
diagrams
beyond
their
outer
shape
had
gained
sway
the
racial
memory
persisted
and
in
the
latter
pleistocene
epoch
the
knowledge
of
altering
shapes
through
force
of
mind
became
a
racial
memory
coalesced
into
cults
of
belief
degenerated
into
forms
and
phrases
but
from
generation
to
generation
the
memory
was
kept
alive
that
once
when
the
world
was
new
the
form
of
things
was
indeed
changed
by
thought
this
holy
man
far
away
and
long
ago
had
pointed
his
finger
at
a
tree
and
lo
a
beautiful
nymph
had
stepped
forth
clad
in
jewels
and
coins
to
make
him
rich
this
hero
climbed
a
mountain
and
a
voice
spoke
unto
him
and
proof
of
this
were
letters
cut
in
stone
this
divine
one
changed
some
water
into
wine
and
fed
a
multitude
from
five
small
loaves
and
fishes
a
kind
of
radiation
of
its
own
always
the
cults
who
sought
the
inner
meanings
formed
within
that
asian
land
and
spread
outward
through
the
world
but
out
on
the
periphery
and
not
exposed
to
thought
of
inner
meanings
another
cult
took
shape
here
concern
was
solely
with
the
outer
shape
and
size
and
weight
and
measurement
of
things
and
how
the
size
and
shape
and
weight
of
one
interacted
with
another
the
dravidian
culture
which
grasped
only
the
idea
but
not
the
method
of
how
the
inner
vibration
could
change
the
outer
shape
receded
and
became
submerged
in
the
western
cult
that
found
a
method
in
the
measurement
of
shape
and
weight
of
things
to
make
them
change
it
was
rabindranath
centuries
later
who
described
the
essential
difference
between
the
indian
and
the
grecian
civilization
as
that
between
a
forest
culture
which
had
known
no
walls
and
a
city
culture
where
everything
has
limit
and
every
inch
must
be
mapped
but
perhaps
also
the
greeks
had
never
seen
this
tree
changed
into
bird
this
cloud
changed
into
flower
not
trapped
by
memories
grown
into
tradition
that
must
not
die
they
hit
upon
an
approach
that
man
could
master
for
it
was
the
greek
beginnings
which
led
to
the
oxford
definition
of
how
to
make
scientific
inquiry
into
the
properties
of
things
inquiry
into
the
properties
at
first
the
outer
shapes
and
weights
led
inevitably
straight
back
to
vibrations
all
matter
is
merely
a
specific
vibration
of
energy
a
range
of
vibrations
feeling
solid
to
the
senses
as
a
range
of
light
vibrations
translate
into
color
through
the
eyes
e
it
took
man
far
he
too
began
an
exploration
of
the
stars
failure
in
their
first
attempt
had
brought
a
wisdom
to
the
sentient
fields
of
force
this
time
they
did
not
rush
in
with
pyrotechnic
displays
to
show
the
wondrous
power
they
knew
observing
patiently
through
the
centuries
by
now
they
knew
man
well
they
knew
his
weakness
yet
by
making
thing
react
with
thing
he
proved
his
strength
for
here
he
was
among
the
stars
perhaps
by
now
he
might
communicate
perhaps
by
now
he
would
not
prostrate
himself
and
grovel
in
the
dust
if
someone
said
hello
but
careful
perhaps
he
would
there
had
been
a
man
by
name
of
galileo
with
the
first
crude
telescope
he
made
who
first
saw
the
rings
of
saturn
but
not
as
rings
but
rather
in
the
planet
tilting
he
had
seen
a
spot
of
light
on
either
side
and
sometime
later
when
he
looked
again
the
tilting
of
the
planet
back
had
made
the
rings
edge
on
and
so
they
disappeared
he
never
looked
again
nor
told
of
what
he
seen
for
legend
had
it
that
the
god
saturn
periodically
devoured
his
own
children
and
this
phenomenon
he
seen
if
it
became
widely
known
would
be
interpreted
as
the
proof
the
legend
was
correct
and
do
incalculable
damage
to
scientific
inquiry
he
known
the
temper
of
his
fellow
man
well
enough
to
take
no
chances
of
this
kind
to
note
the
experience
in
his
works
perhaps
discuss
it
with
a
cautious
friend
or
two
but
to
add
no
further
fuel
to
the
raging
fires
of
superstition
that
consumed
men
minds
and
seared
out
possibility
of
rational
thought
so
walk
with
care
for
superstition
still
is
paramount
despite
the
fact
that
some
men
know
how
to
reach
the
stars
to
communicate
this
time
the
fields
of
force
took
a
sere
planet
of
barren
blistered
rock
and
with
a
concept
made
it
into
the
garden
of
man
dreams
on
one
island
they
set
up
a
crystalline
structure
a
thing
this
much
concession
to
the
mind
of
man
a
tool
to
amplify
and
clarify
their
thought
to
reach
the
still
rudimentary
but
nevertheless
present
centers
of
man
mind
some
certain
man
who
might
be
ready
to
receive
that
thought
placed
in
man
exploratory
path
the
waiting
was
not
long
until
man
found
it
they
had
not
led
him
to
it
through
any
intuitive
change
of
course
that
he
might
find
suspect
the
explorers
landed
claimed
it
for
earth
and
went
away
none
among
them
felt
any
pull
from
the
crystal
tool
upon
the
mountaintop
the
scientists
came
to
make
their
measurements
their
busy
minds
were
full
of
weight
and
size
and
the
relationship
of
thing
to
thing
perhaps
by
now
they
too
were
so
committed
to
the
use
of
a
thing
to
act
upon
another
thing
that
they
could
not
countenance
the
thought
that
thought
could
act
upon
a
thing
direct
they
measured
the
crystal
tool
and
recorded
all
their
measurements
but
found
no
meaning
in
its
arches
and
its
spires
if
any
felt
the
impact
of
the
thinking
of
the
fields
of
force
he
made
no
sign
nor
gave
response
indeed
to
preserve
his
status
and
reputation
with
his
fellow
scientists
he
not
have
dared
admit
a
meaning
that
could
not
be
measured
with
his
instruments
forevermore
he
be
outcast
if
he
but
hinted
that
he
thought
their
science
was
insufficient
to
capture
everything
of
meaning
there
and
to
scientist
most
of
all
his
status
with
his
fellow
man
means
more
than
truth
at
least
to
most
but
are
there
some
to
whom
the
truth
is
paramount
yes
for
had
not
scientist
after
scientist
through
the
years
risked
and
lost
his
status
through
his
questioning
and
then
perhaps
today
there
are
such
men
so
walk
with
care
and
wait
the
colonists
came
and
as
the
scientists
minds
had
been
filled
with
measurements
and
weights
and
analyses
the
colonists
minds
were
filled
with
cabins
fields
food
surely
among
men
somewhere
there
must
be
those
not
wholly
captured
on
the
one
hand
by
formless
superstition
and
on
the
other
hand
not
bound
within
the
tightly
narrowed
circle
of
weight
and
measurement
surely
man
must
know
by
now
he
could
not
capture
the
inner
meaning
of
a
thing
through
a
description
of
its
outer
surface
but
as
long
as
man
got
by
and
did
great
things
by
using
physical
things
to
act
upon
other
physical
things
even
in
considering
the
universal
energy
as
a
thing
he
would
look
no
farther
all
right
then
a
little
nudge
in
another
direction
change
the
concept
of
the
planet
slightly
so
that
one
thing
can
not
act
upon
another
no
tool
be
used
except
this
crystal
set
to
act
as
intermediary
let
that
happen
and
out
from
earth
a
man
would
come
perhaps
a
dozen
men
perhaps
a
hundred
ships
a
thousand
men
and
all
to
find
their
ships
their
tools
were
gone
but
someday
there
would
come
a
man
with
mind
trained
in
the
ability
to
conceive
that
there
might
be
a
road
to
truth
outside
the
useless
superstitions
that
sent
man
to
groveling
in
the
dust
at
each
small
breath
that
blew
and
also
one
who
would
not
quit
because
he
had
no
weather
vane
to
test
the
direction
of
that
breath
and
they
would
know
when
that
mind
came
the
first
man
came
take
away
his
tools
and
wait
he
did
not
fall
to
earth
in
awe
nor
freeze
in
fear
his
mind
searched
curiously
enough
the
man
was
here
shield
off
the
planet
from
the
rest
that
he
be
undisturbed
in
his
thought
could
he
go
farther
conceive
the
purpose
of
this
lack
of
tools
that
it
was
by
design
and
still
not
grovel
in
the
dust
they
made
their
move
could
he
respond
he
drew
a
circle
in
the
sand
joy
ecstasy
this
time
there
might
be
surcease
to
the
loneliness
and
two
intelligences
so
unlike
commune
the
very
unlikeness
of
each
bringing
to
the
other
thought
not
yet
considered
and
together
going
on
to
find
to
find
now
let
him
see
the
fallacy
of
such
strict
measurement
now
let
him
think
to
realize
that
measuring
the
balance
of
the
status
quo
of
things
in
only
one
relationship
of
an
infinity
of
possibilities
to
realize
that
he
can
change
his
measurements
to
balance
an
equation
designed
to
express
the
status
quo
or
with
equal
truth
at
his
desire
he
can
change
the
status
quo
the
shape
of
things
to
fit
the
equation
he
desires
let
him
wander
puzzled
worrying
on
this
let
him
work
it
out
himself
for
experience
from
long
ago
had
taught
them
that
if
man
was
not
ready
to
accept
an
alien
thought
he
could
not
would
not
accept
but
in
his
own
interpreting
now
at
last
at
his
readiness
to
make
things
fit
the
equation
he
conceives
instead
of
making
the
equation
fit
the
things
as
they
are
bring
him
closer
in
the
range
of
the
amplifier
the
crystal
tool
that
communication
might
be
direct
he
holds
the
key
he
knows
the
lock
he
finds
the
door
show
him
the
one
small
step
remaining
the
diagram
the
design
the
movement
of
the
forces
of
his
mind
to
turn
the
key
unlock
the
lock
throw
wide
the
door
as
one
awakened
from
a
deep
sleep
a
hypnotic
trance
cal
opened
his
eyes
man
ancient
thought
filled
his
being
the
subject
of
man
dreams
of
yearnings
of
philosophies
in
ancient
eidetic
memory
the
unbroken
thread
persisted
if
i
could
only
grasp
this
elusive
thing
always
just
barely
beyond
my
reach
i
would
not
need
the
ox
the
wagon
the
train
the
plane
the
spaceship
to
transport
me
from
here
to
there
and
now
at
last
the
thought
was
in
cal
grasp
express
the
things
and
forces
balanced
in
equation
to
describe
them
as
they
are
or
equally
to
alter
the
things
and
forces
instead
to
fit
the
equation
balance
one
had
in
mind
purely
a
matter
of
choice
each
was
the
use
of
natural
law
no
chaos
here
no
magic
one
as
much
true
science
as
the
other
how
long
had
he
slept
and
dreamed
a
few
minutes
an
hour
or
by
chance
was
he
another
rip
van
winkle
doomed
to
find
the
colonists
aged
or
dead
but
why
wonder
a
short
distance
first
just
outside
the
amphitheater
just
a
small
test
he
first
rearranged
the
relative
position
of
himself
to
the
amphitheater
to
be
outside
instead
of
in
it
he
diagrammed
the
forces
in
his
mind
that
would
alter
the
relationship
connected
them
he
was
standing
outside
the
entrance
arch
with
a
hoarse
cry
louie
who
had
been
watching
all
the
while
through
the
open
arch
shrank
back
away
from
cal
wavered
in
uncertainty
then
fell
to
his
knees
then
groveled
in
the
dust
forgive
me
he
cried
in
my
blind
senseless
vanity
i
did
not
know
you
were
a
holy
one
i
was
going
to
kill
you
i
confess
woe
woe
i
saw
you
lying
there
in
their
temple
defaming
it
in
blasphemy
by
your
sleep
but
when
i
tried
to
enter
i
could
not
their
will
prevented
me
some
shielding
force
protected
you
and
then
i
knew
you
were
a
holy
one
forgive
me
let
me
live
to
expiate
my
sin
louie
louie
cal
said
sadly
as
if
in
tangled
ball
the
thought
stream
of
louie
twisted
and
warped
by
the
false
reasonings
and
interpretations
fed
to
him
in
childhood
seemed
clearly
revealed
to
cal
again
a
change
in
concept
of
relationship
to
reality
the
schematic
of
forces
visualized
the
untangling
straightening
of
thought
louie
scrambled
to
his
feet
a
rueful
grin
on
his
face
sorry
cal
he
said
i
must
have
gone
nuts
there
for
a
while
shock
and
all
i
all
right
now
do
worry
anymore
about
me
i
get
on
back
to
the
rest
sure
louie
see
you
there
cal
agreed
a
rearrangement
of
relationships
and
cal
walked
out
from
behind
a
bush
to
approach
jed
and
tom
you
must
not
have
gone
all
the
way
to
the
top
jed
said
when
he
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
cal
it
just
barely
past
noon
i
reckon
did
expect
to
see
you
back
until
nightfall
i
took
a
short
cut
cal
said
with
a
grin
little
past
noon
he
continued
as
if
musing
with
a
thought
about
the
same
time
of
day
that
everything
happened
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
yeah
about
the
same
time
of
day
jed
said
and
looked
at
him
curiously
tom
had
arisen
to
his
feet
and
was
staring
at
cal
curiously
sensing
a
difference
in
the
now
jed
felt
it
too
and
looked
at
cal
with
puzzlement
on
his
face
there
something
important
about
it
being
around
this
time
of
day
cal
he
asked
not
really
cal
said
but
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
i
could
restore
the
village
the
fields
the
escape
ship
everything
just
as
it
was
make
it
feel
like
a
continuation
of
the
same
day
to
the
people
it
being
the
same
time
of
day
would
help
the
illusion
that
no
time
had
passed
nothing
had
happened
tom
eyes
narrowed
in
speculation
you
can
do
that
cal
he
asked
you
solved
the
problem
yes
cal
said
simply
i
tell
you
about
it
sometime
there
quite
a
few
loose
ends
to
catch
up
right
now
he
turned
to
jed
how
about
it
jed
he
asked
think
it
be
too
much
of
a
shock
to
put
things
back
as
they
were
in
spite
of
himself
jed
was
trembling
he
drew
a
deep
breath
firmed
his
jaw
seemed
to
set
himself
as
one
does
in
the
dentist
chair
at
the
approach
of
the
drill
it
was
a
bigger
equation
a
more
complex
one
but
not
different
in
kind
the
village
of
appletree
sprang
suddenly
into
being
the
hangar
with
the
metallic
gleam
of
the
ship
inside
the
fields
the
pasture
fences
with
the
calves
separated
from
the
cows
a
few
people
clothed
were
walking
on
the
dirt
street
between
the
houses
they
looked
at
one
another
they
looked
up
at
the
sky
at
the
fields
around
them
the
forests
beyond
they
looked
back
at
one
another
they
shook
their
heads
and
blinked
their
eyes
as
if
suddenly
wakened
from
a
sleep
a
dream
the
craziest
dream
later
they
would
compare
the
dream
and
with
jed
help
piece
together
and
feel
the
shock
and
wonder
upon
the
hill
away
from
the
village
where
jed
lay
clothed
in
the
hammock
swung
between
two
trees
martha
came
out
of
the
house
clothed
i
must
have
sat
down
in
a
chair
for
a
minute
and
fallen
asleep
or
something
jed
she
said
as
she
came
to
stand
beside
him
and
i
had
the
funniest
dream
you
ca
imagine
you
know
how
sometimes
dream
about
being
out
in
front
of
folks
all
naked
that
was
any
dream
martha
he
answered
with
a
grin
all
the
people
in
the
village
are
going
to
start
realizing
it
pretty
soon
they
need
some
help
we
better
walk
down
there
them
people
across
the
ridge
too
bet
they
be
hightailing
it
back
over
here
first
thing
you
know
and
something
else
there
an
e
ship
here
come
to
find
out
why
we
did
communicate
well
whatever
on
earth
are
you
talkin
about
jed
she
asked
curiously
it
wo
be
time
to
communicate
for
a
couple
of
days
yet
you
ought
to
know
that
have
you
been
dreaming
too
or
you
and
the
boys
fermenting
something
here
let
me
smell
your
breath
aw
now
martha
he
said
with
a
huge
grin
he
clambered
out
of
the
hammock
and
stood
up
took
her
in
his
arms
hugged
her
tightly
jed
she
scolded
right
out
here
in
the
front
yard
in
front
of
everybody
but
she
did
struggle
away
from
him
wo
matter
a
bit
he
said
not
after
what
been
goin
on
in
front
of
everybody
right
along
whatever
has
been
goin
on
ca
be
half
as
bad
as
what
i
been
dreamin
she
said
better
start
gettin
used
to
the
idea
that
it
was
a
dream
martha
he
cautioned
jed
she
scolded
again
her
face
aflame
with
embarrassment
the
communications
operator
looked
up
as
the
supervisor
came
down
the
aisle
toward
him
communication
from
the
ship
at
eden
coming
in
just
fine
he
said
enthusiastically
he
thought
it
over
and
decided
he
better
repair
some
fences
good
job
here
no
use
letting
his
irritation
with
the
supervisor
fussiness
make
him
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
see
that
it
does
the
supervisor
answered
sharply
he
recognized
the
overture
for
what
it
was
felt
relieved
that
he
would
have
any
more
insubordination
was
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
after
a
suitable
period
of
punishment
what
been
happening
he
asked
with
a
curiosity
that
got
the
better
of
his
desire
to
discipline
e
gray
has
come
back
out
of
that
quartz
outcropping
where
we
lost
him
he
standing
there
talking
to
the
astronavigator
who
followed
him
up
the
mountain
more
of
the
same
i
guess
the
supervisor
said
nothing
happened
for
ten
days
nothing
likely
to
happen
he
said
he
turned
and
started
back
down
the
aisle
toward
his
own
office
wait
a
minute
the
operator
called
here
something
other
operator
heads
raised
up
all
down
the
aisle
now
now
now
now
the
supervisor
quarreled
at
them
get
on
with
your
work
nothing
to
concern
you
here
none
of
your
business
but
of
course
it
was
everybody
business
anything
different
was
everybody
business
all
over
the
world
everybody
was
wondering
about
the
enigma
of
eden
everybody
speculating
everybody
with
a
different
answer
some
were
gleeful
that
science
had
finally
got
its
comeuppance
and
felt
no
more
than
a
pleasure
that
the
bigdomes
had
proved
they
were
any
smarter
than
anybody
else
others
took
an
equal
pleasure
in
crying
woe
woe
at
this
proof
there
were
mysteries
beyond
knowing
woe
woe
now
that
man
would
be
punished
for
trying
to
know
what
he
was
not
meant
to
know
the
operator
took
time
out
in
spite
of
the
supervisor
admonishments
to
listen
frankly
they
lost
sight
of
the
e
the
operator
exclaimed
no
wait
a
minute
there
he
is
down
in
the
valley
coming
out
from
behind
a
bush
to
talk
to
the
pilot
and
the
head
man
of
the
colony
ca
have
happened
like
that
the
supervisor
grumbled
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
that
mountain
top
to
the
valley
the
ship
has
garbled
their
reporting
probably
got
behind
in
reporting
and
then
just
decided
to
skip
the
journey
back
and
pick
up
to
make
it
current
there
going
to
be
complaints
about
this
well
you
were
right
here
the
operator
said
you
were
listening
i
did
skip
anything
it
was
my
fault
all
right
all
right
wait
a
minute
the
operator
said
here
listen
in
the
supervisor
eyes
grew
round
ca
be
he
exclaimed
all
the
buildings
everything
just
like
it
was
before
the
operator
said
loudly
to
the
room
at
large
all
of
a
sudden
the
way
they
report
it
they
faking
the
reports
the
supervisor
grumbled
irritably
have
to
be
now
no
matter
how
much
they
fake
you
ca
rebuild
all
those
buildings
in
a
couple
hours
the
operator
argued
none
of
our
business
the
supervisor
cautioned
we
just
take
the
reports
ca
criticize
us
for
whatever
the
ship
out
doing
and
everybody
got
their
clothes
back
on
the
operator
said
loudly
there
was
a
sigh
of
regret
up
and
down
the
aisle
now
the
e
disappeared
again
the
operator
said
they
scanning
all
over
trying
to
find
him
the
supervisor
put
down
his
headset
with
resolution
i
going
to
my
office
to
make
a
report
on
the
sloppy
way
this
reporting
has
been
done
there
going
to
be
fur
flying
over
these
skips
and
jumps
and
i
do
want
it
to
be
our
fur
best
thing
is
to
make
the
complaint
first
he
said
to
the
room
at
large
now
you
call
me
if
there
any
more
of
this
bollix
he
said
to
the
operator
as
he
left
an
hour
passed
while
the
supervisor
sat
in
his
office
he
wrote
furiously
scratched
out
wrote
some
more
tore
up
papers
and
threw
them
in
the
vague
direction
of
the
wastebasket
started
afresh
to
write
some
more
how
to
report
without
stepping
on
anybody
toes
his
buzzer
sounded
softly
to
give
him
respite
and
he
looked
up
from
a
virtually
blank
piece
of
paper
to
the
board
the
eden
operator
again
oh
no
he
groaned
but
he
left
his
desk
at
once
and
half
trotted
up
the
aisle
now
the
captain
of
the
ship
says
he
wants
sector
chief
hayes
at
once
the
operator
called
out
something
very
important
very
well
the
supervisor
said
ring
him
but
hayes
did
wait
for
the
ring
he
had
been
listening
tired
gaunt
for
lack
of
sleep
give
me
connection
he
said
to
the
operator
as
soon
as
the
line
opened
bill
hayes
here
captain
he
said
as
soon
as
he
received
the
signal
what
now
gray
the
junior
e
wife
has
disappeared
from
aboard
ship
the
captain
said
without
any
preliminaries
what
do
you
mean
hayes
asked
how
could
she
disappear
in
deep
space
have
you
looked
everywhere
checked
the
lifeboats
maybe
she
took
one
and
tried
to
get
down
to
her
husband
by
herself
we
looked
everywhere
no
lifeboats
missing
no
port
has
opened
you
ought
to
know
we
would
bother
you
until
we
checked
everything
out
first
she
ca
have
disappeared
into
thin
air
thin
space
hayes
quarreled
back
she
must
be
on
your
ship
somewhere
when
was
she
last
seen
that
ah
that
mainly
why
i
calling
you
bill
the
captain
said
a
wild
tale
obviously
a
mistake
one
of
the
crewmen
passed
her
stateroom
about
an
hour
ago
door
was
open
and
he
looked
in
the
way
anybody
does
says
he
saw
her
standing
inside
her
cabin
embracing
a
man
says
he
did
stop
to
look
close
but
he
was
pretty
sure
it
was
e
gray
says
he
knows
because
he
had
access
to
the
viewscope
and
has
watched
e
gray
on
the
surface
of
eden
there
been
no
report
of
any
ship
leaving
eden
joining
you
captain
hayes
said
accusingly
because
there
has
been
any
the
captain
snapped
back
so
it
have
been
e
gray
she
was
embracing
that
why
i
called
you
looks
like
we
going
to
have
some
petty
scandal
mixed
up
with
everything
else
looks
like
it
then
hayes
said
with
a
vast
weariness
some
member
of
your
crew
or
one
of
the
scientists
he
said
keep
looking
hiding
her
probably
to
keep
the
scandal
from
breaking
but
it
seems
odd
to
me
that
she
was
so
anxious
to
get
out
there
near
her
husband
and
then
in
ten
days
she
maybe
her
real
anxiety
was
to
be
near
somebody
already
assigned
to
the
ship
the
captain
said
i
mean
we
got
to
consider
all
the
possibilities
somebody
she
knew
there
at
keep
checking
captain
i
see
if
the
board
wants
to
contact
e
mcginnis
maybe
he
knows
what
been
going
on
around
here
that
could
lead
us
to
the
guy
who
hiding
her
i
keep
checking
but
she
not
on
board
ship
the
captain
said
he
sighed
bill
hayes
sighed
they
broke
connection
hayes
made
contact
with
the
board
chairman
it
took
only
a
few
minutes
to
spin
the
latest
tale
of
woe
another
minute
for
the
board
to
decide
direct
intervention
now
they
want
me
to
make
contact
with
the
other
ship
the
operator
said
to
the
supervisor
the
wheel
himself
wants
to
know
if
e
mcginnis
will
talk
to
him
well
contact
it
contact
it
the
supervisor
commanded
urgently
i
doing
it
i
doing
it
the
operator
quarreled
back
the
both
of
them
listened
in
on
the
conversation
on
the
grounds
that
testing
the
quality
of
reception
was
a
necessity
e
mcginnis
pilot
was
quite
explicit
e
mcginnis
left
orders
that
under
no
circumstances
was
he
to
be
disturbed
the
pilot
said
he
e
gray
and
gray
are
in
his
cabin
in
conference
e
gray
mrs
gray
the
chairman
exploded
impossible
how
the
devil
did
they
get
into
your
ship
do
ask
me
the
pilot
said
in
a
tired
voice
i
just
work
here
sitting
here
minding
my
own
business
i
see
e
mcginnis
door
open
he
leans
out
the
door
and
gives
me
my
orders
i
look
past
him
and
i
see
e
gray
and
gray
sitting
in
the
room
do
ask
me
how
they
got
in
there
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
this
i
going
to
get
myself
a
nice
quiet
milk
run
to
saturn
or
someplace
soon
as
i
get
back
to
if
i
ever
do
get
back
now
now
the
board
chairman
soothed
i
sure
there
a
simple
explanation
crewmen
willing
to
pilot
an
e
around
the
universe
were
hard
to
find
yeah
after
what
i
seen
out
here
i
do
think
i
even
want
to
hear
it
the
pilot
said
and
without
apology
cut
off
the
communication
had
the
pilot
been
able
a
moment
later
to
look
into
the
e
stateroom
he
would
have
seen
still
another
visitor
another
who
had
not
entered
his
ship
by
any
normal
means
attorney
general
gunderson
sat
in
a
chair
facing
the
two
e
and
linda
he
seemed
stunned
frozen
into
immobility
only
his
eyes
were
alive
darting
here
and
there
unbelieving
there
is
limit
to
the
number
of
shocks
the
mind
can
withstand
and
the
series
had
come
too
fast
for
him
to
adjust
to
them
he
too
had
picked
up
junior
e
gray
as
soon
as
he
came
through
the
arch
of
the
quartz
outcropping
on
top
of
the
mountain
the
structure
that
somehow
interfered
with
their
visoscope
ability
to
penetrate
and
see
what
went
on
inside
he
had
been
watching
when
gray
suddenly
disappeared
from
where
he
had
been
talking
with
the
astronavigator
that
had
been
a
shock
immediately
followed
by
a
greater
one
when
the
ship
operator
had
scanned
the
valley
and
found
gray
talking
with
the
e
pilot
and
the
chief
of
the
colonists
there
was
no
way
in
which
the
journey
could
have
been
made
that
rapidly
he
was
still
watching
when
the
village
the
fields
the
escape
ship
the
e
ship
all
had
suddenly
materialized
before
his
eyes
and
the
people
were
all
clothed
it
could
be
done
but
he
had
seen
it
but
he
kept
his
head
e
science
must
be
farther
along
than
he
realized
to
produce
a
miracle
such
as
this
but
it
was
science
he
must
hold
to
that
otherwise
he
saw
his
case
begin
to
melt
out
from
under
him
and
he
made
one
more
effort
to
regain
some
measure
of
control
he
gave
his
own
pilot
orders
to
land
on
the
surface
of
eden
he
transmitted
orders
to
the
other
two
police
ships
to
follow
in
close
formation
the
three
of
them
to
land
and
take
custody
but
the
barrier
still
remained
and
the
ships
could
not
penetrate
it
he
told
himself
that
all
was
lost
maybe
the
e
was
back
in
control
of
eden
but
he
gunderson
still
had
a
morals
case
all
those
photographs
some
of
the
press
and
commentators
might
desert
him
now
that
the
junior
had
proved
adequate
to
the
job
unless
he
chose
carefully
some
stupid
judge
might
decide
the
means
were
justified
by
the
end
result
but
there
were
those
photographs
and
the
world
was
full
of
grundy
he
might
have
to
back
up
a
little
bit
on
the
incompetence
of
the
junior
e
but
grundy
would
be
behind
him
a
hundred
per
cent
on
the
morals
issue
when
he
released
some
of
the
photographs
and
titillated
her
nasty
imagination
by
reference
to
others
too
indecent
to
release
it
was
then
that
the
observer
ship
got
a
call
through
to
him
and
told
him
that
the
photographs
every
one
of
them
had
disappeared
from
the
ship
vault
where
they
had
been
locked
and
the
only
thing
remaining
in
the
vault
was
one
little
slip
of
paper
which
read
shame
on
you
for
taking
feelthy
pictures
naughty
naughty
calvin
gray
the
case
was
crumbling
but
all
was
not
lost
he
still
had
witnesses
he
thought
for
a
minute
and
began
to
wonder
about
those
witnesses
any
judge
anybody
around
the
courts
anybody
connected
with
the
press
and
maybe
even
some
of
the
public
knew
that
any
police
officer
will
swear
to
any
lie
to
back
up
another
police
officer
because
he
might
need
the
favor
returned
tomorrow
without
concrete
evidence
he
suddenly
found
himself
standing
in
the
cabin
of
the
e
ship
confronted
by
e
mcginnis
junior
e
gray
and
gray
he
sank
down
in
a
chair
and
sat
frozen
immobile
only
his
eyes
were
alive
darting
frantically
here
and
there
as
if
expecting
some
hole
to
open
up
and
swallow
him
perhaps
wishing
one
would
i
do
know
just
what
to
do
with
you
cal
said
a
little
sadly
ruefully
far
as
the
e
are
concerned
you
only
been
a
minor
nuisance
hardly
worth
noticing
but
your
intentions
were
dangerous
as
far
back
as
man
history
goes
the
growth
of
police
powers
immediately
preceded
and
caused
the
fall
and
destruction
of
each
culture
it
is
a
law
of
the
nature
of
man
that
he
will
resist
the
ascendancy
of
any
special
group
over
him
that
this
resistance
will
grow
until
man
will
even
destroy
himself
in
the
attempt
to
destroy
that
ascendancy
in
more
recent
history
it
was
the
growth
extension
and
severity
of
the
police
in
controlling
every
activity
of
man
that
destroyed
both
the
united
states
and
russia
now
you
are
attempting
to
rebuild
that
same
police
control
in
world
government
the
result
will
be
the
same
man
will
destroy
himself
in
trying
to
destroy
you
we
in
e
do
want
that
to
happen
we
see
no
need
of
it
we
have
already
warned
that
the
attitude
of
the
police
toward
the
public
is
the
major
cause
of
crime
that
crime
will
increase
with
each
increase
of
police
power
and
severity
until
the
whole
structure
rots
and
crumbles
yet
man
has
not
yet
progressed
far
enough
to
know
how
to
maintain
an
organized
society
without
some
special
body
to
enforce
that
organization
it
a
problem
which
the
e
have
solved
probably
because
we
know
too
little
about
the
natural
laws
affecting
the
behavior
of
man
perhaps
it
is
still
a
field
belonging
to
because
science
does
know
enough
yet
to
take
hold
of
it
i
would
suggest
gunderson
that
you
turn
your
talents
and
your
organization
to
solving
this
problem
of
how
to
build
an
organized
society
instead
of
destroying
it
the
chair
where
gunderson
had
sat
was
empty
e
mcginnis
looked
at
cal
he
too
was
sitting
silent
and
immobile
but
e
science
had
inured
him
to
shock
he
waited
because
it
was
e
gray
show
and
he
was
letting
cal
handle
it
where
is
he
now
mcginnis
asked
when
he
saw
the
empty
chair
sitting
at
his
desk
in
his
office
back
on
earth
cal
said
with
a
grin
our
boy
has
a
few
things
to
think
about
you
explained
the
theory
back
of
all
this
mcginnis
changed
the
subject
but
i
still
find
it
incredible
it
still
just
theory
well
cal
said
theory
comes
first
even
to
add
two
and
two
you
first
have
to
get
the
idea
that
it
can
be
done
a
theory
of
how
it
is
done
but
that
still
wo
get
you
four
you
got
to
learn
how
to
apply
the
theory
when
i
first
found
i
knew
how
i
was
pretty
concerned
the
whole
basis
of
science
is
that
anybody
can
do
it
anybody
who
follows
the
method
it
does
take
any
special
gifts
that
ca
be
trained
i
had
visions
of
a
world
a
universe
of
people
in
possession
of
this
theory
and
method
before
they
were
wise
enough
to
use
it
and
chaos
but
when
i
thought
it
over
i
stopped
worrying
the
methods
of
science
are
also
open
to
all
but
few
bother
to
learn
them
most
prefer
their
frustrations
and
their
miseries
to
making
the
effort
which
will
solve
them
for
centuries
the
libraries
containing
all
the
accumulated
knowledge
and
wisdom
of
mankind
have
been
free
and
open
to
anybody
who
wants
to
read
but
few
have
bothered
to
absorb
that
knowledge
and
that
wisdom
this
new
key
we
have
that
unlocks
the
door
to
another
vista
of
knowledge
another
point
of
view
whereby
we
can
change
material
things
to
suit
our
desire
is
merely
another
advance
of
science
for
science
after
all
is
no
more
than
organized
knowledge
of
reality
you
multiply
six
times
six
until
you
learned
how
to
add
two
and
two
most
people
wo
bother
it
will
be
a
long
long
time
before
any
significant
number
will
graduate
through
all
the
normal
seven
steps
of
e
science
to
become
ready
for
the
eighth
some
of
the
e
will
master
it
but
you
know
how
few
there
are
and
the
e
have
enough
restraint
wisdom
and
selflessness
to
use
this
new
knowledge
for
the
benefit
of
man
instead
of
his
detriment
i
suspect
that
one
has
to
be
graduated
beyond
the
desire
to
make
ascendant
over
others
before
he
can
absorb
this
knowledge
maybe
that
my
trouble
mcginnis
said
slowly
i
been
thinking
all
along
of
how
much
power
this
gives
the
e
wondering
if
even
the
e
should
have
that
much
power
over
others
linda
spoke
up
e
mcginnis
she
said
cal
has
solved
the
problem
of
what
happened
to
the
colonists
why
they
did
communicate
do
you
think
this
will
qualify
him
for
his
big
e
both
men
burst
into
laughter
no
question
of
it
linda
e
mcginnis
said
with
a
chuckle
but
i
doubt
it
really
matters
to
e
gray
now
he
can
do
things
none
of
the
rest
of
us
can
do
and
the
real
question
now
is
whether
we
have
the
right
to
call
ourselves
seniors
until
we
can
match
his
ability
i
think
cal
said
slowly
we
better
recommend
to
that
the
colonists
be
withdrawn
from
eden
assigned
somewhere
else
i
left
the
shield
around
the
planet
so
none
can
enter
or
leave
without
the
eighth
key
i
can
unlock
the
door
and
close
it
again
perhaps
eden
should
become
the
next
step
for
the
e
the
next
hurdle
he
must
cross
when
i
sent
my
ship
and
crew
back
to
earth
and
we
removed
all
the
colonists
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
restore
eden
to
what
it
was
when
i
arrived
a
place
where
no
tools
will
work
no
physical
tools
to
qualify
for
e
a
man
will
be
put
on
the
island
where
he
can
live
as
we
lived
to
work
out
the
method
when
he
ready
he
can
go
into
the
on
top
of
the
mountain
and
if
his
mind
is
open
enough
to
the
potentials
he
receive
the
final
step
of
instruction
as
i
did
one
by
one
as
the
e
shake
free
of
their
present
projects
they
can
take
this
next
step
i
not
working
on
any
project
right
now
e
mcginnis
said
hopefully
i
be
right
back
cal
said
with
a
grin
and
we
get
started
on
it
the
chair
where
he
had
been
sitting
was
empty
cal
stood
within
the
crystal
amphitheater
atop
the
mountain
and
watched
the
interplay
of
lights
until
he
felt
communion
come
rapture
joy
question
be
patient
he
said
there
will
be
more
and
more
and
more
you
had
an
advantage
he
reminded
them
you
started
with
a
crystalline
vibration
nearer
to
the
force
field
than
that
possible
in
protoplasm
we
had
to
come
up
the
hard
way
but
we
have
come
up
you
had
no
competition
we
had
to
fight
for
our
very
lives
every
inch
of
the
way
endure
the
setbacks
lasting
for
centuries
millennia
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
concept
has
dominated
all
our
thought
and
does
still
without
it
we
not
have
survived
at
all
it
takes
time
to
outgrow
it
to
learn
we
can
survive
without
it
five
hundred
years
after
copernicus
a
survey
of
the
high
school
students
in
the
united
states
revealed
that
a
third
of
them
still
rejected
his
knowledge
still
believed
the
earth
to
be
at
the
center
of
the
universe
and
man
was
the
reason
why
the
universe
had
been
created
at
all
but
two
thirds
had
adjusted
more
important
there
a
copernicus
do
sell
man
short
because
he
slow
to
learn
and
you
are
impatient
for
fuller
deeper
exploration
of
the
truths
in
reality
he
has
much
to
offer
you
as
you
to
him
competition
for
survival
has
given
him
ingenuity
once
all
learned
men
believed
the
earth
to
be
the
center
of
the
universe
but
there
a
copernicus
who
asked
the
question
if
it
is
so
millions
of
men
watched
apples
fall
to
the
ground
but
one
ask
if
this
might
not
be
the
key
to
the
structure
of
the
universe
the
balance
of
the
stars
billions
watched
the
stars
but
finally
one
ask
if
the
light
be
curved
instead
of
straight
there
is
capacity
in
man
this
protoplasmic
life
that
had
to
learn
an
ingenuity
which
might
surpass
even
yours
this
is
not
the
final
door
in
the
corridor
of
thought
still
other
doors
on
down
the
corridor
are
yet
to
be
explored
and
you
may
need
these
special
gifts
of
man
to
open
them
as
he
has
needed
this
new
room
of
thought
be
patient
a
million
or
a
billion
may
come
here
to
seek
the
method
that
can
change
things
to
fit
the
equation
of
desire
before
one
comes
who
asks
a
question
even
you
have
not
conceived
but
someday
he
come
and
ask
the
lights
danced
faster
now
in
patterns
of
delight
